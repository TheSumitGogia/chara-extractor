Mr.
Sherlock
Holmes
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Sherlock
Holmes
,
who
was
usually
very
late
in
the
mornings
,
save
*NL*
upon
those
not
infrequent
occasions
when
he
was
up
all
night
,
was
seated
*NL*
at
the
breakfast
table
.
I
stood
upon
the
hearth-rug
and
picked
up
the
*NL*
stick
which
our
visitor
had
left
behind
him
the
night
before
.
It
was
a
*NL*
fine
,
thick
piece
of
wood
,
bulbous-headed
,
of
the
sort
which
is
known
as
*NL*
a
``
Penang
lawyer
.
''
Just
under
the
head
was
a
broad
silver
band
nearly
*NL*
an
inch
across
.
``
To
James
Mortimer
,
M.R.C.S.
,
from
his
friends
of
the
*NL*
C.C.H.
,
''
was
engraved
upon
it
,
with
the
date
``
1884
.
''
It
was
just
such
a
*NL*
stick
as
the
old-fashioned
family
practitioner
used
to
carry
--
dignified
,
*NL*
solid
,
and
reassuring
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Watson
,
what
do
you
make
of
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Holmes
was
sitting
with
his
back
to
me
,
and
I
had
given
him
no
sign
of
*NL*
my
occupation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
did
you
know
what
I
was
doing
?
I
believe
you
have
eyes
in
the
back
*NL*
of
your
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
,
at
least
,
a
well-polished
,
silver-plated
coffee-pot
in
front
of
*NL*
me
,
''
said
he
.
``
But
,
tell
me
,
Watson
,
what
do
you
make
of
our
visitor
's
*NL*
stick
?
Since
we
have
been
so
unfortunate
as
to
miss
him
and
have
no
*NL*
notion
of
his
errand
,
this
accidental
souvenir
becomes
of
importance
.
*NL*
Let
me
hear
you
reconstruct
the
man
by
an
examination
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
,
''
said
I
,
following
as
far
as
I
could
the
methods
of
my
*NL*
companion
,
``
that
Dr.
Mortimer
is
a
successful
,
elderly
medical
man
,
*NL*
well-esteemed
since
those
who
know
him
give
him
this
mark
of
their
*NL*
appreciation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
!
''
said
Holmes
.
``
Excellent
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
also
that
the
probability
is
in
favour
of
his
being
a
country
*NL*
practitioner
who
does
a
great
deal
of
his
visiting
on
foot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
this
stick
,
though
originally
a
very
handsome
one
has
been
so
*NL*
knocked
about
that
I
can
hardly
imagine
a
town
practitioner
carrying
it
.
*NL*
The
thick-iron
ferrule
is
worn
down
,
so
it
is
evident
that
he
has
done
a
*NL*
great
amount
of
walking
with
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perfectly
sound
!
''
said
Holmes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then
again
,
there
is
the
`
friends
of
the
C.C.H.
'
I
should
guess
*NL*
that
to
be
the
Something
Hunt
,
the
local
hunt
to
whose
members
he
has
*NL*
possibly
given
some
surgical
assistance
,
and
which
has
made
him
a
small
*NL*
presentation
in
return
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
,
Watson
,
you
excel
yourself
,
''
said
Holmes
,
pushing
back
his
*NL*
chair
and
lighting
a
cigarette
.
``
I
am
bound
to
say
that
in
all
the
*NL*
accounts
which
you
have
been
so
good
as
to
give
of
my
own
small
*NL*
achievements
you
have
habitually
underrated
your
own
abilities
.
It
may
*NL*
be
that
you
are
not
yourself
luminous
,
but
you
are
a
conductor
of
*NL*
light
.
Some
people
without
possessing
genius
have
a
remarkable
power
of
*NL*
stimulating
it
.
I
confess
,
my
dear
fellow
,
that
I
am
very
much
in
your
*NL*
debt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
never
said
as
much
before
,
and
I
must
admit
that
his
words
gave
*NL*
me
keen
pleasure
,
for
I
had
often
been
piqued
by
his
indifference
to
my
*NL*
admiration
and
to
the
attempts
which
I
had
made
to
give
publicity
to
*NL*
his
methods
.
I
was
proud
,
too
,
to
think
that
I
had
so
far
mastered
his
*NL*
system
as
to
apply
it
in
a
way
which
earned
his
approval
.
He
now
took
*NL*
the
stick
from
my
hands
and
examined
it
for
a
few
minutes
with
his
naked
*NL*
eyes
.
Then
with
an
expression
of
interest
he
laid
down
his
cigarette
,
*NL*
and
carrying
the
cane
to
the
window
,
he
looked
over
it
again
with
a
*NL*
convex
lens
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Interesting
,
though
elementary
,
''
said
he
as
he
returned
to
his
*NL*
favourite
corner
of
the
settee
.
``
There
are
certainly
one
or
two
*NL*
indications
upon
the
stick
.
It
gives
us
the
basis
for
several
*NL*
deductions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
anything
escaped
me
?
''
I
asked
with
some
self-importance
.
``
I
trust
*NL*
that
there
is
nothing
of
consequence
which
I
have
overlooked
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
,
my
dear
Watson
,
that
most
of
your
conclusions
were
*NL*
erroneous
.
When
I
said
that
you
stimulated
me
I
meant
,
to
be
frank
,
that
*NL*
in
noting
your
fallacies
I
was
occasionally
guided
towards
the
truth
.
*NL*
Not
that
you
are
entirely
wrong
in
this
instance
.
The
man
is
certainly
a
*NL*
country
practitioner
.
And
he
walks
a
good
deal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
was
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
that
extent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
that
was
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
my
dear
Watson
,
not
all
--
by
no
means
all
.
I
would
suggest
,
for
*NL*
example
,
that
a
presentation
to
a
doctor
is
more
likely
to
come
from
a
*NL*
hospital
than
from
a
hunt
,
and
that
when
the
initials
`
C.C.
'
are
placed
*NL*
before
that
hospital
the
words
`
Charing
Cross
'
very
naturally
suggest
*NL*
themselves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
be
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
probability
lies
in
that
direction
.
And
if
we
take
this
as
a
*NL*
working
hypothesis
we
have
a
fresh
basis
from
which
to
start
our
*NL*
construction
of
this
unknown
visitor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
supposing
that
`
C.C.H.
'
does
stand
for
`
Charing
Cross
*NL*
Hospital
,
'
what
further
inferences
may
we
draw
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
none
suggest
themselves
?
You
know
my
methods
.
Apply
them
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
only
think
of
the
obvious
conclusion
that
the
man
has
practised
*NL*
in
town
before
going
to
the
country
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
that
we
might
venture
a
little
farther
than
this
.
Look
at
it
*NL*
in
this
light
.
On
what
occasion
would
it
be
most
probable
that
such
a
*NL*
presentation
would
be
made
?
When
would
his
friends
unite
to
give
him
*NL*
a
pledge
of
their
good
will
?
Obviously
at
the
moment
when
Dr.
Mortimer
*NL*
withdrew
from
the
service
of
the
hospital
in
order
to
start
a
practice
*NL*
for
himself
.
We
know
there
has
been
a
presentation
.
We
believe
there
has
*NL*
been
a
change
from
a
town
hospital
to
a
country
practice
.
Is
it
,
then
,
*NL*
stretching
our
inference
too
far
to
say
that
the
presentation
was
on
the
*NL*
occasion
of
the
change
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
certainly
seems
probable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
you
will
observe
that
he
could
not
have
been
on
the
staff
of
the
*NL*
hospital
,
since
only
a
man
well-established
in
a
London
practice
could
*NL*
hold
such
a
position
,
and
such
a
one
would
not
drift
into
the
country
.
*NL*
What
was
he
,
then
?
If
he
was
in
the
hospital
and
yet
not
on
the
staff
he
*NL*
could
only
have
been
a
house-surgeon
or
a
house-physician
--
little
more
*NL*
than
a
senior
student
.
And
he
left
five
years
ago
--
the
date
is
on
the
*NL*
stick
.
So
your
grave
,
middle-aged
family
practitioner
vanishes
into
*NL*
thin
air
,
my
dear
Watson
,
and
there
emerges
a
young
fellow
under
thirty
,
*NL*
amiable
,
unambitious
,
absent-minded
,
and
the
possessor
of
a
favourite
*NL*
dog
,
which
I
should
describe
roughly
as
being
larger
than
a
terrier
and
*NL*
smaller
than
a
mastiff
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
laughed
incredulously
as
Sherlock
Holmes
leaned
back
in
his
settee
and
*NL*
blew
little
wavering
rings
of
smoke
up
to
the
ceiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
to
the
latter
part
,
I
have
no
means
of
checking
you

said
I
,
``

*NL*
at

it
is
not
difficult

From

I
took

down

turned
up

There
were
several

The
appearance
of
our
visitor
was
a
surprise
to
me
,
since
I
had
expected
*NL*
a
typical
country
practitioner
.
He
was
a
very
tall
,
thin
man
,
with
a
*NL*
long
nose
like
a
beak
,
which
jutted
out
between
two
keen
,
gray
eyes
,
*NL*
set
closely
together
and
sparkling
brightly
from
behind
a
pair
of
*NL*
gold-rimmed
glasses
.
He
was
clad
in
a
professional
but
rather
slovenly
*NL*
fashion
,
for
his
frock-coat
was
dingy
and
his
trousers
frayed
.
Though
*NL*
young
,
his
long
back
was
already
bowed
,
and
he
walked
with
a
forward
*NL*
thrust
of
his
head
and
a
general
air
of
peering
benevolence
.
As
he
*NL*
entered
his
eyes
fell
upon
the
stick
in
Holmes
's
hand
,
and
he
ran
*NL*
towards
it
with
an
exclamation
of
joy
.
``
I
am
so
very
glad
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
``
I
was
not
sure
whether
I
had
left
it
here
or
in

Shipping
Office

*NL*

not
lose
that
stick
for

shaking
his
head

*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Mortimer
blinked
through
his
glasses
in
mild
astonishment

``
Why
was
*NL*
it
bad

``
Yes

so
left
the

with
it
all
hopes

The

drew

1730

*NL*

``
The

Dr.

drew
it
from

committed

three
months

created

much

excitement

I
may
say
that
I
was

was

*NL*
Holmes
stretched
out
his

for
the

flattened
it
upon

his
knee
.
``

the

*NL*
*NL*
I
looked
over
his

at
the
yellow

the
faded

At

the

was
written

in

scrawling

``

runs
in

the

is
short
and
is
intimately

connected
with
the

With
your

I
will
read
it

*NL*
Holmes
leaned
back
in
his
chair
,
placed
his
finger-tips
together
,
and
*NL*
closed
his
eyes
,
with
an
air
of
resignation
.
Dr.
Mortimer
turned
the
*NL*
manuscript
to
the
light
and
read
in
a
high
,
cracking
voice
the
following
*NL*
curious
,
old-world
narrative
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
the
origin
of
the
Hound
of
the
Baskervilles
there
*NL*
have
been
many
statements
,
yet
as
I
come
in
a
direct
*NL*
line
from
Hugo
Baskerville
,
and
as
I
had
the
story
from
*NL*
my
father
,
who
also
had
it
from
his
,
I
have
set
it
down
*NL*
with
all
belief
that
it
occurred
even
as
is
here
set
*NL*
forth
.
And
I
would
have
you
believe
,
my
sons
,
that
the
*NL*
same
Justice
which
punishes
sin
may
also
most
graciously
*NL*
forgive
it
,
and
that
no
ban
is
so
heavy
but
that
by
prayer
*NL*
and
repentance
it
may
be
removed
.
Learn
then
from
this
*NL*
story
not
to
fear
the
fruits
of
the
past
,
but
rather
to
*NL*
be
circumspect
in
the
future
,
that
those
foul
passions
*NL*
whereby
our
family
has
suffered
so
grievously
may
not
*NL*
again
be
loosed
to
our
undoing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Know
then
that
in
the
time
of
the
Great
Rebellion
-LRB-
the
*NL*
history
of
which
by
the
learned
Lord
Clarendon
I
most
*NL*
earnestly
commend
to
your
attention
-RRB-
this
Manor
of
*NL*
Baskerville
was
held
by
Hugo
of
that
name
,
nor
can
it
be
*NL*
gainsaid
that
he
was
a
most
wild
,
profane
,
and
godless
*NL*
man
.
This
,
in
truth
,
his
neighbours
might
have
pardoned
,
*NL*
seeing
that
saints
have
never
flourished
in
those
parts
,
*NL*
but
there
was
in
him
a
certain
wanton
and
cruel
humour
*NL*
which
made
his
name
a
by-word
through
the
West
.
It
*NL*
chanced
that
this
Hugo
came
to
love
-LRB-
if
,
indeed
,
so
dark
*NL*
a
passion
may
be
known
under
so
bright
a
name
-RRB-
the
daughter
*NL*
of
a
yeoman
who
held
lands
near
the
Baskerville
estate
.
*NL*
But
the
young
maiden
,
being
discreet
and
of
good
repute
,
*NL*
would
ever
avoid
him
,
for
she
feared
his
evil
name
.
So
*NL*
it
came
to
pass
that
one
Michaelmas
this
Hugo
,
with
five
*NL*
or
six
of
his
idle
and
wicked
companions
,
stole
down
upon
*NL*
the
farm
and
carried
off
the
maiden
,
her
father
and
*NL*
brothers
being
from
home
,
as
he
well
knew
.
When
they
had
*NL*
brought
her
to
the
Hall
the
maiden
was
placed
in
an
upper
*NL*
chamber
,
while
Hugo
and
his
friends
sat
down
to
a
long
*NL*
carouse
,
as
was
their
nightly
custom
.
Now
,
the
poor
lass
*NL*
upstairs
was
like
to
have
her
wits
turned
at
the
singing
*NL*
and
shouting
and
terrible
oaths
which
came
up
to
her
from
*NL*
below
,
for
they
say
that
the
words
used
by
Hugo
Baskerville
,
*NL*
when
he
was
in
wine
,
were
such
as
might
blast
the
man
who
*NL*
said
them
.
At
last
in
the
stress
of
her
fear
she
did
that
*NL*
which
might
have
daunted
the
bravest
or
most
active
man
,
*NL*
for
by
the
aid
of
the
growth
of
ivy
which
covered
-LRB-
and
*NL*
still
covers
-RRB-
the
south
wall
she
came
down
from
under
the
*NL*
eaves
,
and
so
homeward
across
the
moor
,
there
being
three
*NL*
leagues
betwixt
the
Hall
and
her
father
's
farm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
chanced
that
some
little
time
later
Hugo
left
his
*NL*
guests
to
carry
food
and
drink
--
with
other
worse
things
,
*NL*
perchance
--
to
his
captive
,
and
so
found
the
cage
empty
*NL*
and
the
bird
escaped
.
Then
,
as
it
would
seem
,
he
became
*NL*
as
one
that
hath
a
devil
,
for
,
rushing
down
the
stairs
*NL*
into
the
dining-hall
,
he
sprang
upon
the
great
table
,
*NL*
flagons
and
trenchers
flying
before
him
,
and
he
cried
*NL*
aloud
before
all
the
company
that
he
would
that
very
*NL*
night
render
his
body
and
soul
to
the
Powers
of
Evil
if
*NL*
he
might
but
overtake
the
wench
.
And
while
the
revellers
*NL*
stood
aghast
at
the
fury
of
the
man
,
one
more
wicked
or
,
*NL*
it
may
be
,
more
drunken
than
the
rest
,
cried
out
that
*NL*
they
should
put
the
hounds
upon
her
.
Whereat
Hugo
ran
*NL*
from
the
house
,
crying
to
his
grooms
that
they
should
*NL*
saddle
his
mare
and
unkennel
the
pack
,
and
giving
the
*NL*
hounds
a
kerchief
of
the
maid
's
,
he
swung
them
to
the
*NL*
line
,
and
so
off
full
cry
in
the
moonlight
over
the
moor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
for
some
space
the
revellers
stood
agape
,
unable
*NL*
to
understand
all
that
had
been
done
in
such
haste
.
But
*NL*
anon
their
bemused
wits
awoke
to
the
nature
of
the
deed
*NL*
which
was
like
to
be
done
upon
the
moorlands
.
Everything
*NL*
was
now
in
an
uproar
,
some
calling
for
their
pistols
,
*NL*
some
for
their
horses
,
and
some
for
another
flask
of
*NL*
wine
.
But
at
length
some
sense
came
back
to
their
crazed
*NL*
minds
,
and
the
whole
of
them
,
thirteen
in
number
,
took
*NL*
horse
and
started
in
pursuit
.
The
moon
shone
clear
above
*NL*
them
,
and
they
rode
swiftly
abreast
,
taking
that
course
*NL*
which
the
maid
must
needs
have
taken
if
she
were
to
reach
*NL*
her
own
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
had
gone
a
mile
or
two
when
they
passed
one
of
the
*NL*
night
shepherds
upon
the
moorlands
,
and
they
cried
to
*NL*
him
to
know
if
he
had
seen
the
hunt
.
And
the
man
,
as
*NL*
the
story
goes
,
was
so
crazed
with
fear
that
he
could
*NL*
scarce
speak
,
but
at
last
he
said
that
he
had
indeed
seen
*NL*
the
unhappy
maiden
,
with
the
hounds
upon
her
track
.
`
But
*NL*
I
have
seen
more
than
that
,
'
said
he
,
`
for
Hugo
Baskerville
*NL*
passed
me
upon
his
black
mare
,
and
there
ran
mute
behind
*NL*
him
such
a
hound
of
hell
as
God
forbid
should
ever
be
at
*NL*
my
heels
.
'
So
the
drunken
squires
cursed
the
shepherd
*NL*
and
rode
onward
.
But
soon
their
skins
turned
cold
,
for
*NL*
there
came
a
galloping
across
the
moor
,
and
the
black
*NL*
mare
,
dabbled
with
white
froth
,
went
past
with
trailing
*NL*
bridle
and
empty
saddle
.
Then
the
revellers
rode
close
*NL*
together
,
for
a
great
fear
was
on
them
,
but
they
still
*NL*
followed
over
the
moor
,
though
each
,
had
he
been
alone
,
*NL*
would
have
been
right
glad
to
have
turned
his
horse
's
*NL*
head
.
Riding
slowly
in
this
fashion
they
came
at
last
*NL*
upon
the
hounds
.
These
,
though
known
for
their
valour
*NL*
and
their
breed
,
were
whimpering
in
a
cluster
at
the
*NL*
head
of
a
deep
dip
or
goyal
,
as
we
call
it
,
upon
the
*NL*
moor
,
some
slinking
away
and
some
,
with
starting
hackles
*NL*
and
staring
eyes
,
gazing
down
the
narrow
valley
before
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
company
had
come
to
a
halt
,
more
sober
men
,
as
you
*NL*
may
guess
,
than
when
they
started
.
The
most
of
them
*NL*
would
by
no
means
advance
,
but
three
of
them
,
the
boldest
,
*NL*
or
it
may
be
the
most
drunken
,
rode
forward
down
the
goyal
.
*NL*
Now
,
it
opened
into
a
broad
space
in
which
stood
two
of
*NL*
those
great
stones
,
still
to
be
seen
there
,
which
were
*NL*
set
by
certain
forgotten
peoples

*NL*
The
moon
was
shining
bright
upon

clearing
,
and
there
*NL*
in
the
centre
lay
the
unhappy
maid
where
she
had
fallen
,
*NL*
dead
of
fear
and
of
fatigue
.
But
it
was
not
the
sight
*NL*
of
her
body

yet
was
it
that
of
the
body
of
Hugo
*NL*
Baskerville
lying
near
her
,
which
raised
the
hair
upon
*NL*
the
heads
of
these
three
dare-devil
roysterers
,
but
it
*NL*
was
that
,
standing
over
Hugo
,
and
plucking
at
his
throat
,
*NL*
there
stood
a
foul
thing

a
great

black
beast

shaped
*NL*

And
even
as

looked
the
thing
*NL*
tore
the
throat
out
of
Hugo
Baskerville

on
which
,
as
it
*NL*
turned
its
blazing
eyes

dripping
jaws
upon
them
,
the
*NL*
three
shrieked
with
fear
and
rode
for
dear
life
,
still
*NL*
screaming
,
across
the
moor
.
One
,
it
is
said
,
died
that
*NL*
very
night
of
what
he
had
seen

the
coming

is
said
to
have
plagued
the

so
sorely
ever

I
have

hinted

Nor
can
it
be

that
many

of
the

have
been
unhappy

have
been

When
Dr.

had
finished
reading
this
singular
narrative
he
pushed
*NL*
his
spectacles
up
on
his

and
stared
across
at
Mr.

The

yawned

tossed
the

``
Now

This

is
the
Devon
County
Chronicle
of
May
14th
of
this
year
.
It
is
a
short
*NL*
account
of
the
facts
elicited
at
the
death
of
Sir
Charles
Baskerville
*NL*
which
occurred
a
few
days
before
that
date
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
friend
leaned
a
little
forward
and
his
expression
became
intent
.
Our
*NL*
visitor
readjusted
his
glasses
and
began
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
recent
sudden
death
of
Sir
Charles
Baskerville
,
whose
*NL*
name
has
been
mentioned
as
the
probable
Liberal
candidate
*NL*
for
Mid-Devon
at
the
next
election
,
has
cast
a
gloom
over
*NL*
the
county
.
Though
Sir
Charles
had
resided
at
Baskerville
*NL*
Hall
for
a
comparatively
short
period
his
amiability
of
*NL*
character
and
extreme
generosity
had
won
the
affection
*NL*
and
respect
of
all
who
had
been
brought
into
contact
with
*NL*
him
.
In
these
days
of
nouveaux
riches
it
is
refreshing
*NL*
to
find
a
case
where
the
scion
of
an
old
county
family
*NL*
which
has
fallen
upon
evil
days
is
able
to
make
his
own
*NL*
fortune
and
to
bring
it
back
with
him
to
restore
the
*NL*
fallen
grandeur
of
his
line
.
Sir
Charles
,
as
is
well
known
,
*NL*
made
large
sums
of
money
in
South
African
speculation
.
*NL*
More
wise
than
those
who
go
on
until
the
wheel
turns
*NL*
against
them
,
he
realized
his
gains
and
returned
to
England
*NL*
with
them
.
It
is
only
two
years
since
he
took
up
his
*NL*
residence
at
Baskerville
Hall
,
and
it
is
common
talk
how
*NL*
large
were
those
schemes
of
reconstruction
and
improvement
*NL*
which
have
been
interrupted
by
his
death
.
Being
himself
*NL*
childless
,
it
was
his
openly
expressed
desire
that
the
*NL*
whole
countryside
should
,
within
his
own
lifetime
,
profit
*NL*
by
his
good
fortune
,
and
many
will
have
personal
reasons
*NL*
for
bewailing
his
untimely
end
.
His
generous
donations
*NL*
to
local
and
county
charities
have
been
frequently
*NL*
chronicled
in
these
columns
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
circumstances
connected
with
the
death
of
Sir
Charles
*NL*
can
not
be
said
to
have
been
entirely
cleared
up
by
the
*NL*
inquest
,
but
at
least
enough
has
been
done
to
dispose
of
*NL*
those
rumours
to
which
local
superstition
has
given
rise
.
*NL*
There
is
no
reason
whatever
to
suspect
foul
play
,
or
to
*NL*
imagine
that
death
could
be
from
any
but
natural
causes
.
*NL*
Sir
Charles
was
a
widower
,
and
a
man
who
may
be
said
to
*NL*
have
been
in
some
ways
of
an
eccentric
habit
of
mind
.
*NL*
In
spite
of
his
considerable
wealth
he
was
simple
in
his
*NL*
personal
tastes
,
and
his
indoor
servants
at
Baskerville
*NL*
Hall
consisted
of
a
married
couple
named
Barrymore
,
the
*NL*
husband
acting
as
butler
and
the
wife
as
housekeeper
.
*NL*
Their
evidence
,
corroborated
by
that
of
several
friends
,
*NL*
tends
to
show
that
Sir
Charles
's
health
has
for
some
time
*NL*
been
impaired
,
and
points
especially
to
some
affection
*NL*
of
the
heart
,
manifesting
itself
in
changes
of
colour
,
*NL*
breathlessness
,
and
acute
attacks
of
nervous
depression
.
*NL*
Dr.
James
Mortimer
,
the
friend
and
medical
attendant
of
*NL*
the
deceased
,
has
given
evidence
to
the
same
effect
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
facts
of
the
case
are
simple
.
Sir
Charles
Baskerville
*NL*
was
in
the
habit
every
night
before
going
to
bed
of
walking
*NL*
down
the
famous
yew
alley
of
Baskerville
Hall
.
The
evidence
*NL*
of
the
Barrymores
shows
that
this
had
been
his
custom
.
*NL*
On
the
fourth
of
May
Sir
Charles
had
declared
his
intention
*NL*
of
starting
next
day
for
London
,
and
had
ordered
Barrymore
*NL*
to
prepare
his
luggage
.
That
night
he
went
out
as
usual
*NL*
for
his
nocturnal
walk
,
in
the
course
of
which
he
was
in
*NL*
the
habit
of
smoking
a
cigar
.
He
never
returned
.
At
*NL*
twelve
o'clock
Barrymore
,
finding
the
hall
door
still
open
,
*NL*
became
alarmed
,
and
,
lighting
a
lantern
,
went
in
search
*NL*
of
his
master
.
The
day
had
been
wet
,
and
Sir
Charles
's
*NL*
footmarks
were
easily
traced
down
the
alley
.
Halfway
down
*NL*
this
walk
there
is
a
gate
which
leads
out
on
to
the
moor
.
*NL*
There
were
indications
that
Sir
Charles
had
stood
for
some
*NL*
little
time
here
.
He
then
proceeded
down
the
alley
,
and
*NL*
it
was
at
the
far
end
of
it
that
his
body
was
discovered
.
*NL*
One
fact
which
has
not
been
explained
is
the
statement
*NL*
of
Barrymore
that
his
master
's
footprints
altered
their
*NL*
character
from
the
time
that
he
passed
the
moor-gate
,
and
*NL*
that
he
appeared
from
thence
onward
to
have
been
walking
*NL*
upon
his
toes
.
One
Murphy
,
a
gipsy
horse-dealer
,
was
on
*NL*
the
moor
at
no
great
distance
at
the
time
,
but
he
appears
*NL*
by
his
own
confession
to
have
been
the
worse
for
drink
.
*NL*
He
declares
that
he
heard
cries
but
is
unable
to
state
*NL*
from
what
direction
they
came
.
No
signs
of
violence
were
*NL*
to
be
discovered
upon
Sir
Charles
's
person
,
and
though
*NL*
the
doctor
's
evidence
pointed
to
an
almost
incredible
*NL*
facial
distortion
--
so
great
that
Dr.
Mortimer
refused
at
*NL*
first
to
believe
that
it
was
indeed
his
friend
and
patient
*NL*
who
lay
before
him
--
it
was
explained
that
that
is
a
symptom
*NL*
which
is
not
unusual
in
cases
of
dyspnoea
and
death
from
*NL*
cardiac
exhaustion
.
This
explanation
was
borne
out
by
*NL*
the
post-mortem
examination
,
which
showed
long-standing
*NL*
organic
disease
,
and
the
coroner
's
jury
returned
a
*NL*
verdict
in
accordance
with
the
medical
evidence
.
It
is
*NL*
well
that
this
is
so
,
for
it
is
obviously
of
the
utmost
*NL*
importance
that
Sir
Charles
's
heir
should
settle
at
the
*NL*
Hall
and
continue
the
good
work
which
has
been
so
sadly
*NL*
interrupted
.
Had
the
prosaic
finding
of
the
coroner
not
*NL*
finally
put
an
end
to
the
romantic
stories
which
have
been
*NL*
whispered
in
connection
with
the
affair
,
it
might
have
been
*NL*
difficult
to
find
a
tenant
for
Baskerville
Hall
.
It
is
*NL*
understood
that
the
next
of
kin
is
Mr.
Henry
Baskerville
,
*NL*
if
he
be
still
alive
,
the
son
of
Sir
Charles
Baskerville
's
*NL*
younger
brother
.
The
young
man
when
last
heard
of
was
*NL*
in
America
,
and
inquiries
are
being
instituted
with
a
*NL*
view
to
informing
him
of
his
good
fortune
.
''

*NL*
Dr.
Mortimer
refolded
his
paper
and
replaced
it
in
his
pocket

``
Those
*NL*

said
Sherlock
Holmes

``
for
calling
my
attention
to
a
*NL*
case
which
certainly
presents
some
features
of
interest
.
I
had
observed
*NL*
some
newspaper
comment
at
the
time
,
but
I
was
exceedingly
preoccupied
*NL*
by
that
little
affair
of
the
Vatican
cameos
,
and
in
my
anxiety
to
oblige
*NL*
the
Pope
I
lost
touch
with
several
interesting
English
cases
.
This
*NL*
article
,
you
say
,
contains
all
the
public
facts
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
does
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
let
me
have
the
private
ones
.
''
He
leaned
back
,
put
his
finger-tips
*NL*
together
,
and
assumed
his
most
impassive
and
judicial
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
doing
so
,
''
said
Dr.
Mortimer
,
who
had
begun
to
show
signs
of
some
*NL*
strong
emotion
,
``
I
am
telling
that
which
I
have
not
confided
to
anyone
.
*NL*
My
motive
for
withholding
it
from
the
coroner
's
inquiry
is
that
a
man
of
*NL*
science
shrinks
from
placing
himself
in
the
public
position
of
seeming
*NL*
to
indorse
a
popular
superstition
.
I
had
the
further
motive
that
*NL*
Baskerville
Hall
,
as
the
paper
says
,
would
certainly
remain
untenanted
*NL*
if
anything
were
done
to
increase
its
already
rather
grim
reputation
.
*NL*
For
both
these
reasons
I
thought
that
I
was
justified
in
telling
rather
*NL*
less
than
I
knew
,
since
no
practical
good
could
result
from
it
,
but
with
*NL*
you
there
is
no
reason
why
I
should
not
be
perfectly
frank
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
moor
is
very
sparsely
inhabited
,
and
those
who
live
near
each
other
*NL*
are
thrown
very
much
together
.
For
this
reason
I
saw
a
good
deal
of
*NL*
Sir
Charles
Baskerville
.
With
the
exception
of
Mr.
Frankland
,
of
Lafter
*NL*
Hall
,
and
Mr.
Stapleton
,
the
naturalist
,
there
are
no
other
men
of
*NL*
education
within
many
miles
.
Sir
Charles
was
a
retiring
man
,
but
the
*NL*
chance
of
his
illness
brought
us
together
,
and
a
community
of
interests
*NL*
in
science
kept
us
so
.
He
had
brought
back
much
scientific
information
*NL*
from
South
Africa
,
and
many
a
charming
evening
we
have
spent
together
*NL*
discussing
the
comparative
anatomy
of
the
Bushman
and
the
Hottentot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Within
the
last
few
months
it
became
increasingly
plain
to
me
that
*NL*
Sir
Charles
's
nervous
system
was
strained
to
the
breaking
point
.
He
had
*NL*
taken
this
legend
which
I
have
read
you
exceedingly
to
heart
--
so
much
*NL*
so
that
,
although
he
would
walk
in
his
own
grounds
,
nothing
would
induce
*NL*
him
to
go
out
upon
the
moor
at
night
.
Incredible
as
it
may
appear
to
*NL*
you
,
Mr.
Holmes
,
he
was
honestly
convinced
that
a
dreadful
fate
overhung
*NL*
his
family
,
and
certainly
the
records
which
he
was
able
to
give
of
*NL*
his
ancestors
were
not
encouraging
.
The
idea
of
some
ghastly
presence
*NL*
constantly
haunted
him
,
and
on
more
than
one
occasion
he
has
asked
me
*NL*
whether
I
had
on
my
medical
journeys
at
night
ever
seen
any
strange
*NL*
creature
or
heard
the
baying
of
a
hound
.
The
latter
question
he
put
*NL*
to
me
several
times
,
and
always
with
a
voice
which
vibrated
with
*NL*
excitement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
well
remember
driving
up
to
his
house
in
the
evening
some
three
*NL*
weeks
before
the
fatal
event
.
He
chanced
to
be
at
his
hall
door
.
I
had
*NL*
descended
from
my
gig
and
was
standing
in
front
of
him
,
when
I
saw
*NL*
his
eyes
fix
themselves
over
my
shoulder
and
stare
past
me
with
an
*NL*
expression
of
the
most
dreadful
horror
.
I
whisked
round
and
had
just
*NL*
time
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
something
which
I
took
to
be
a
large
black
*NL*
calf
passing
at
the
head
of
the
drive
.
So
excited
and
alarmed
was
he
*NL*
that
I
was
compelled
to
go
down
to
the
spot
where
the
animal
had
been
*NL*
and
look
around
for
it
.
It
was
gone
,
however
,
and
the
incident
appeared
*NL*
to
make
the
worst
impression
upon
his
mind
.
I
stayed
with
him
all
the
*NL*
evening
,
and
it
was
on
that
occasion
,
to
explain
the
emotion
which
he
*NL*
had
shown
,
that
he
confided
to
my
keeping
that
narrative
which
I
read
to
*NL*
you
when
first
I
came
.
I
mention
this
small
episode
because
it
assumes
*NL*
some
importance
in
view
of
the
tragedy
which
followed
,
but
I
was
*NL*
convinced
at
the
time
that
the
matter
was
entirely
trivial
and
that
his
*NL*
excitement
had
no
justification
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
at
my
advice
that
Sir
Charles
was
about
to
go
to
London
.
His
*NL*
heart
was
,
I
knew
,
affected
,
and
the
constant
anxiety
in
which
he
lived
,
*NL*
however
chimerical
the
cause
of
it
might
be
,
was
evidently
having
a
*NL*
serious
effect
upon
his
health
.
I
thought
that
a
few
months
among
the
*NL*
distractions
of
town
would
send
him
back
a
new
man
.
Mr.
Stapleton
,
a
*NL*
mutual
friend
who
was
much
concerned
at
his
state
of
health
,
was
of
the
*NL*
same
opinion

At
the
last
instant
came
this
terrible
catastrophe

Barrymore
the
butler
,
who
made
*NL*
the
discovery
,
sent
Perkins
the
groom
on
horseback
to
me
,
and
as
I
was
*NL*
sitting
up
late
I
was
able
to
reach
Baskerville
Hall
within
an
hour
of
*NL*
the
event
.
I
checked
and
corroborated
all
the
facts
which
were
mentioned
*NL*
at
the
inquest
.
I
followed
the
footsteps
down
the
yew
alley
,
I
saw
the
*NL*
spot
at
the
moor-gate
where
he
seemed
to
have
waited
,
I
remarked
the
*NL*
change
in
the
shape
of
the
prints
after
that
point
,
I
noted
that
there
*NL*
were
no
other
footsteps
save
those
of
Barrymore
on
the
soft
gravel
,
and
*NL*
finally
I
carefully
examined
the
body
,
which
had
not
been
touched
until
*NL*
my
arrival
.
Sir
Charles
lay
on
his
face
,
his
arms
out
,
his
fingers
dug
*NL*
into
the
ground
,
and
his
features
convulsed
with
some
strong
emotion
to
*NL*
such
an
extent
that
I
could
hardly
have
sworn
to
his
identity
.
There
was
*NL*
certainly
no
physical
injury
of
any
kind
.
But
one
false
statement
was
*NL*
made
by
Barrymore
at
the
inquest
.
He
said
that
there
were
no
traces
*NL*
upon
the
ground
round
the
body
.
He
did
not
observe
any
.
But
I
did
--
some
*NL*
little
distance
off
,
but
fresh
and
clear

looked

at

sank

almost

The

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
confess
at
these
words
a
shudder
passed
through
me
.
There
was
a
thrill
*NL*
in
the

voice
which
showed
that
he
was
himself
deeply
moved
by

told

Holmes
leaned
forward
in
his
excitement

his

had
the
hard

shot
from

Since

several

For

I
find

several

which

there

terror

farming
in

From
the
accounts

he

I

three
brothers

whom
poor
Sir

the
elder

who
died

the
father
of
this
lad

The
third

Rodger

was
the
black
sheep
of

He
came
of

the

masterful
Baskerville
strain

was
the
very
image

they
tell

of
the

He
made
England
too
hot

him

fled
to
Central
America

and
died
there
in
1876
of
yellow
fever

is
the
last
of

five
minutes

I
meet
him

I
have
had
a
wire
that
he
arrived
at
*NL*
Southampton
this
morning

Now

Mr.

what
would
you
advise
me
to
*NL*
do
with
him
?

Why

he
not
go
to
the

It
seems
natural

does
it
not

And
yet

consider
that
every
Baskerville
*NL*

goes
there
meets
with
an
evil
fate

I
feel
sure
that
if
Sir
Charles
*NL*
could
have
spoken
with
me
before
his
death
he
would
have
warned
me

bringing
this

the
last
of

old
race

the

great

And

it
can
not
be
denied
that
the
*NL*
prosperity
of
the
whole
poor

bleak

depends
upon
his

has
been
done
by

crash
to

my
own
obvious
interest

bring
the
case
before
you

ask
for
your
advice

Put

.
''
He
scribbled
the
appointment
on
his
*NL*
shirt-cuff
and
hurried
off
in
his
strange
,
peering
,
absent-minded
*NL*
fashion
.
Holmes
stopped
him
at
the
head
of
the
stair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
one
more
question
,
Dr.
Mortimer
.
You
say
that
before
Sir
Charles
*NL*
Baskerville
's
death
several
people
saw
this
apparition
upon
the
moor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Three
people
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
any
see
it
after
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
heard
of
any
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
.
Good-morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Holmes
returned
to
his
seat
with
that
quiet
look
of
inward
satisfaction
*NL*
which
meant
that
he
had
a
congenial
task
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Going
out
,
Watson
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Unless
I
can
help
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
my
dear
fellow
,
it
is
at
the
hour
of
action
that
I
turn
to
you
for
*NL*
aid
.
But
this
is
splendid
,
really
unique
from
some
points
of
view
.
*NL*
When
you
pass
Bradley
's
,
would
you
ask
him
to
send
up
a
pound
of
the
*NL*
strongest
shag
tobacco
?
Thank
you
.
It
would
be
as
well
if
you
could
make
*NL*
it
convenient
not
to
return
before
evening
.
Then
I
should
be
very
glad
*NL*
to
compare
impressions
as
to
this
most
interesting
problem
which
has
*NL*
been
submitted
to
us
this
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
knew
that
seclusion
and
solitude
were
very
necessary
for
my
friend
*NL*
in
those
hours
of
intense
mental
concentration
during
which
he
weighed
*NL*
every
particle
of
evidence
,
constructed
alternative
theories
,
balanced
*NL*
one
against
the
other
,
and
made
up
his
mind
as
to
which
points
were
*NL*
essential
and
which
immaterial
.
I
therefore
spent
the
day
at
my
club
and
*NL*
did
not
return
to
Baker
Street
until
evening
.
It
was
nearly
nine
o'clock
*NL*
when
I
found
myself
in
the
sitting-room
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
first
impression
as
I
opened
the
door
was
that
a
fire
had
broken
out
,
*NL*
for
the
room
was
so
filled
with
smoke
that
the
light
of
the
lamp
upon
*NL*
the
table
was
blurred
by
it
.
As
I
entered
,
however
,
my
fears
were
set
at
*NL*
rest
,
for
it
was
the
acrid
fumes
of
strong
coarse
tobacco
which
took
me
*NL*
by
the
throat
and
set
me
coughing
.
Through
the
haze
I
had
a
vague
vision
*NL*
of
Holmes
in
his
dressing-gown
coiled
up
in
an
armchair
with
his
black
*NL*
clay
pipe
between
his
lips
.
Several
rolls
of
paper
lay
around
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Caught
cold
,
Watson
?
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
's
this
poisonous
atmosphere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
it
is
pretty
thick
,
now
that
you
mention
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thick
!
It
is
intolerable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Open
the
window
,
then
!
You
have
been
at
your
club
all
day
,
I
perceive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Holmes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Am
I
right
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
but
how
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
laughed
at
my
bewildered
expression
.
``
There
is
a
delightful
freshness
*NL*
about
you
,
Watson
,
which
makes
it
a
pleasure
to
exercise
any
small
*NL*
powers
which
I
possess
at
your
expense
.
A
gentleman
goes
forth
on
a
*NL*
showery
and
miry
day
.
He
returns
immaculate
in
the
evening
with
the
*NL*
gloss
still
on
his
hat
and
his
boots
.
He
has
been
a
fixture
therefore
*NL*
all
day
.
He
is
not
a
man
with
intimate
friends
.
Where
,
then
,
could
he
*NL*
have
been
?
Is
it
not
obvious
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
is
rather
obvious
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
world
is
full
of
obvious
things
which
nobody
by
any
chance
ever
*NL*
observes
.
Where
do
you
think
that
I
have
been
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
fixture
also
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
contrary
,
I
have
been
to
Devonshire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
spirit
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
.
My
body
has
remained
in
this
armchair
and
has
,
I
regret
*NL*
to
observe
,
consumed
in
my
absence
two
large
pots
of
coffee
and
an
*NL*
incredible
amount
of
tobacco
.
After
you
left
I
sent
down
to
Stamford
's
*NL*
for
the
Ordnance
map
of
this
portion
of
the
moor
,
and
my
spirit
has
*NL*
hovered
over
it
all
day
.
I
flatter
myself
that
I
could
find
my
way
*NL*
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
large-scale
map
,
I
presume
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
large
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
unrolled
one
section
and
held
it
over
his
knee
.
``
Here
you
have
the
*NL*
particular
district
which
concerns
us
.
That
is
Baskerville
Hall
in
the
*NL*
middle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
a
wood
round
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
.
I
fancy
the
yew
alley
,
though
not
marked
under
that
name
,
must
*NL*
stretch
along
this
line
,
with
the
moor
,
as
you
perceive
,
upon
the
right
*NL*
of
it
.
This
small
clump
of
buildings
here
is
the
hamlet
of
Grimpen
,
*NL*
where
our
friend
Dr.
Mortimer
has
his
headquarters
.
Within
a
radius
of
*NL*
five
miles
there
are
,
as
you
see
,
only
a
very
few
scattered
dwellings
.
*NL*
Here
is
Lafter
Hall
,
which
was
mentioned
in
the
narrative
.
There
is
*NL*
a
house
indicated
here
which
may
be
the
residence
of
the
*NL*
naturalist
--
Stapleton
,
if
I
remember
right
,
was
his
name
.
Here
are
two
*NL*
moorland
farmhouses
,
High
Tor
and
Foulmire
.
Then
fourteen
miles
away
the
*NL*
great
convict
prison
of
Princetown
.
Between
and
around
these
scattered
*NL*
points
extends
the
desolate
,
lifeless
moor
.
This
,
then
,
is
the
stage
*NL*
upon
which
tragedy
has
been
played
,
and
upon
which
we
may
help
to
play
*NL*
it
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
must
be
a
wild
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
the
setting
is
a
worthy
one
.
If
the
devil
did
desire
to
have
a
*NL*
hand
in
the
affairs
of
men
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
are
yourself
inclining
to
the
supernatural
explanation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
devil
's
agents
may
be
of
flesh
and
blood
,
may
they
not
?
There
are
*NL*
two
questions
waiting
for
us
at
the
outset
.
The
one
is
whether
any
crime
*NL*
has
been
committed
at
all
;
the
second
is
,
what
is
the
crime
and
how
was
*NL*
it
committed
?
Of
course
,
if
Dr.
Mortimer
's
surmise
should
be
correct
,
*NL*
and
we
are
dealing
with
forces
outside
the
ordinary
laws
of
Nature
,
*NL*
there
is
an
end
of
our
investigation
.
But
we
are
bound
to
exhaust
all
*NL*
other
hypotheses
before
falling
back
upon
this
one
.
I
think
we
'll
shut
*NL*
that
window
again
,
if
you
do
n't
mind
.
It
is
a
singular
thing
,
but
I
find
*NL*
that
a
concentrated
atmosphere
helps
a
concentration
of
thought
.
I
have
*NL*
not
pushed
it
to
the
length
of
getting
into
a
box
to
think
,
but
that
is
*NL*
the
logical
outcome
of
my
convictions
.
Have
you
turned
the
case
over
in
*NL*
your
mind
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
have
thought
a
good
deal
of
it
in
the
course
of
the
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
make
of
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
very
bewildering
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
has
certainly
a
character
of
its
own
.
There
are
points
of
*NL*
distinction
about
it

That
change
in
the
footprints
,
for
example

What
*NL*
do
you
make
of
that

said
that
the
man
had
walked
on
tiptoe
down
that
portion
of
*NL*
the
alley

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
only
repeated
what
some
fool

walk

down

alley

What
then

running
until

burst
his
heart

and
fell
dead
upon
his
face

*NL*
*NL*
``
Running
from
what
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
lies
our
problem

There
are
indications
that
the
man
was
crazed
*NL*
with
fear
before
ever
he
began
to
run
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
you
say
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
presuming
that
the
cause

his
fears
came
to
him
across
the
moor

If
that
were
so
,
and
it
seems
most
probable
,
only
a
man
who
had
lost
his
*NL*
wits
would
have
run
from
the
house
instead
of
towards
it
.
If
the
*NL*
gipsy
's
evidence
may
be
taken
as
true
,
he
ran
with
cries
for
help
in
the
*NL*
direction
where
help
was
least
likely
to
be
.
Then
,
again
,
whom
was
he
*NL*
waiting
for
that
night
,

why
was
he
waiting
for
him
in
the
yew
alley

than
in
his

house

*NL*
*NL*

You
think
that
he
was
waiting
for
someone

*NL*
``
The
man
was
elderly

infirm

We
can
understand
his
taking
an
evening
*NL*
stroll
,

the
ground
was
damp
and
the
night
inclement
.
Is
it
natural
*NL*
that
he
should
stand
for
five
or
ten
minutes
,
as
Dr.
Mortimer
,
with
more
*NL*
practical
sense
than
I
should
have
given
him
credit
for

deduced
from
*NL*
the
cigar

But
he
went
out
every
evening

I
think
it
unlikely
that
he
waited
at
the
moor-gate
every
evening

On
*NL*
the
contrary

the
evidence
is
that
he
avoided
the
moor

That
night
he

there

It
was
the
night
before
he
made
his
departure

The
thing
takes
shape

Watson

It
becomes
coherent

Might
I
ask
you
to

me
my
violin

we
will
postpone
all
further

Our
breakfast
table
was
cleared
early
,
and
Holmes
waited
in
his
*NL*
dressing-gown
for
the
promised
interview

Our
clients
were
punctual
to
*NL*
their
appointment
,
for
the
clock
had
just
struck
ten
when
Dr.
Mortimer
*NL*
was
shown
up
,
followed
by
the
young
baronet
.
The
latter
was
a
small
,
*NL*
alert
,
dark-eyed
man
about
thirty
years
of
age
,
very
sturdily
built
,
*NL*
with
thick
black
eyebrows
and
a
strong
,
pugnacious
face
.
He
wore
a
*NL*
ruddy-tinted
tweed
suit
and
had
the
weather-beaten
appearance
of
one
who
*NL*
has
spent
most
of
his
time
in
the
open
air
,
and
yet
there
was
something
*NL*
in
his
steady
eye
and
the
quiet
assurance
of
his
bearing
which
indicated
*NL*
the
gentleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

out

He
laid
an

upon
the
table

we
all
bent
over
it

was
of

common
quality

grayish
in
colour

The
address

``
Sir

Northumberland
Hotel

was
printed
in
rough

the
post-mark

the
date
of

the
preceding

``
Hum

Someone
seems

Out
*NL*
of
the
envelope
he
took
a
half-sheet
of
foolscap
paper
folded
into
four

*NL*
This
he
opened
and
spread
flat
upon
the
table

Across
the
middle
of
it
*NL*
a
single
sentence
had
been
formed
by
the
expedient
of
pasting
printed

words

It
ran
:

your
reason
keep
away

Dr.

gazing
at
my

in
amazement

I

really
one
*NL*
of
the
most
remarkable
things
which
I
have
ever
known

How
did
you
do
*NL*
it
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
presume

that
you
could
tell
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
Most
certainly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
that
is
my
special
hobby

The
differences
are
obvious

supra-orbital
crest

facial
angle
,
the
maxillary
curve
,

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
this
is
my
special
hobby

and
the
differences
are
equally
obvious

*NL*
There
is
as
much
difference
to
my
eyes
between
the
leaded
bourgeois
type
*NL*
of
a
Times
article
and
the
slovenly
print
of
an
evening
half-penny
paper
*NL*
as
there
could
be
between
your
negro
and
your
Esquimau
.
The
detection
of
*NL*
types
is
one
of
the
most
elementary
branches
of
knowledge
to
the
special
*NL*
expert
in
crime
,
though
I
confess
that
once
when
I
was
very
young
I
*NL*
confused
the
Leeds
Mercury
with
the
Western
Morning
News
.
But
a
Times
*NL*
leader
is
entirely
distinctive
,
and
these
words
could
have
been
taken
*NL*
from
nothing
else
.
As
it
was
done
yesterday
the
strong
probability
was
*NL*
that
we
should
find
the
words
in
yesterday

issue

*NL*
*NL*
``
So
far
as
I
can
follow
you

Mr.

said
Sir

*NL*
Baskerville
,
``
someone
cut
out
this
message
with
a
scissors

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nail-scissors

''
said
Holmes
.
``
You
can
see
that
it
was
a
very
*NL*
short-bladed
scissors
,
since
the
cutter
had
to
take
two
snips
over

keep
*NL*
away

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
so
.
Someone
,
then
,
cut
out
the

with
a

of

short-bladed
scissors

pasted
it
with
paste

Gum

said
Holmes

*NL*
``
With

on

want
to
know
why
the
word

moor

should

have
been
written

*NL*
*NL*

Because
he
could
not
find
it
in

The
other

were
all
simple

and
might
be
found
in
any
issue
,
but
`
moor
'
would
be
less
common
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
of
course
,
that
would
explain
it
.
Have
you
read
anything
else
in
*NL*
this
message
,
Mr.
Holmes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
one
or
two
indications
,
and
yet
the
utmost
pains
have
been
*NL*
taken
to
remove
all
clues
.
The
address
,
you
observe
is
printed
in
rough
*NL*
characters
.
But
the
Times
is
a
paper
which
is
seldom
found
in
any
hands
*NL*
but
those
of
the
highly
educated
.
We
may
take
it
,
therefore
,
that
*NL*
the
letter
was
composed
by
an
educated
man
who
wished
to
pose
as
an
*NL*
uneducated
one
,
and
his
effort
to
conceal
his
own
writing
suggests
that
*NL*
that
writing
might
be
known
,
or
come
to
be
known
,
by
you
.
Again
,
you
*NL*
will
observe
that
the
words
are
not
gummed
on
in
an
accurate
line
,
but
*NL*
that
some
are
much
higher
than
others
.
`
Life
,
'
for
example
is
quite
out
*NL*
of
its
proper
place
.
That
may
point
to
carelessness
or
it
may
point
to
*NL*
agitation
and
hurry
upon
the
part
of
the
cutter
.
On
the
whole
I
incline
*NL*
to
the
latter
view
,
since
the
matter
was
evidently
important
,
and
it
*NL*
is
unlikely
that
the
composer
of
such
a
letter
would
be
careless
.
If
he
*NL*
were
in
a
hurry
it
opens
up
the
interesting
question
why
he
should
be
*NL*
in
a
hurry
,
since
any
letter
posted
up
to
early
morning
would
reach
*NL*
Sir
Henry
before
he
would
leave
his
hotel
.
Did
the
composer
fear
an
*NL*
interruption
--
and
from
whom
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
coming
now
rather
into
the
region
of
guesswork
,
''
said
Dr.
*NL*
Mortimer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
rather
,
into
the
region
where
we
balance
probabilities
and
choose
*NL*
the
most
likely
.
It
is
the
scientific
use
of
the
imagination
,
but
we
*NL*
have
always
some
material
basis
on
which
to
start
our
speculation
.
Now
,
*NL*
you
would
call
it
a
guess
,
no
doubt
,
but
I
am
almost
certain
that
this
*NL*
address
has
been
written
in
a
hotel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
in
the
world
can
you
say
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
examine
it
carefully
you
will
see
that
both
the
pen
and
the
ink
*NL*
have
given
the
writer
trouble
.
The
pen
has
spluttered
twice
in
a
single
*NL*
word
and
has
run
dry
three
times
in
a
short
address
,
showing
that
there
*NL*
was
very
little
ink
in
the
bottle
.
Now
,
a
private
pen
or
ink-bottle
is
*NL*
seldom
allowed
to
be
in
such
a
state
,
and
the
combination
of
the
two
*NL*
must
be
quite
rare
.
But
you
know
the
hotel
ink
and
the
hotel
pen
,
where
*NL*
it
is
rare
to
get
anything
else
.
Yes
,
I
have
very
little
hesitation
*NL*
in
saying
that
could
we
examine
the
waste-paper
baskets
of
the
hotels
*NL*
around
Charing
Cross
until
we
found
the
remains
of
the
mutilated
Times
*NL*
leader
we
could
lay
our
hands
straight
upon
the
person
who
sent
this
*NL*
singular
message

Halloa
!
Halloa
!
What
's
this
?

*NL*
*NL*
He
was
carefully
examining
the
foolscap
,
upon
which
the
words
were
*NL*
pasted
,
holding
it
only
an
inch
or
two
from
his
eyes

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

``
Nothing

said
he
,
throwing
it
down

I

have
drawn
as
much
*NL*
as
we
can
from
this
curious
letter

now

has
anything

was
only
one
in

I
could
get
no
sense
out

cleans

The
worst
of
it
is
that
I
only
bought

I
have
never

Then
I

hotel
.
I
suppose
*NL*
that
fits
into
its
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
to
show
that
someone
knows
more
than
we
do
about
what
goes
on
*NL*
upon
the
moor
,
''
said
Dr.
Mortimer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
also
,
''
said
Holmes
,
``
that
someone
is
not
ill-disposed
towards
you
,
*NL*
since
they
warn
you
of
danger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
it
may
be
that
they
wish
,
for
their
own
purposes
,
to
scare
me
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
of
course
,
that
is
possible
also
.
I
am
very
much
indebted
to
you
,
*NL*
Dr.
Mortimer
,
for
introducing
me
to
a
problem
which
presents
several
*NL*
interesting
alternatives
.
But
the
practical
point
which
we
now
have
to
*NL*
decide
,
Sir
Henry
,
is
whether
it
is
or
is
not
advisable
for
you
to
go
to
*NL*
Baskerville
Hall
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
I
not
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
seems
to
be
danger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
danger
from
this
family
fiend
or
do
you
mean
danger
from
*NL*
human
beings
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
is
what
we
have
to
find
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whichever
it
is
,
my
answer
is
fixed
.
There
is
no
devil
in
hell
,
Mr.
*NL*
Holmes
,
and
there
is
no
man
upon
earth
who
can
prevent
me
from
going
to
*NL*
the
home
of
my
own
people
,
and
you
may
take
that
to
be
my
final
answer
.
''
*NL*
His
dark
brows
knitted
and
his
face
flushed
to
a
dusky
red
as
he
spoke
.
*NL*
It
was
evident
that
the
fiery
temper
of
the
Baskervilles
was
not
extinct
*NL*
in
this
their
last
representative
.
``
Meanwhile
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
have
hardly
*NL*
had
time
to
think
over
all
that
you
have
told
me
.
It
's
a
big
thing
for
a
*NL*
man
to
have
to
understand
and
to
decide
at
one
sitting
.
I
should
like
*NL*
to
have
a
quiet
hour
by
myself
to
make
up
my
mind
.
Now
,
look
here
,
Mr.
*NL*
Holmes
,
it
's
half-past
eleven
now
and
I
am
going
back
right
away
to
my
*NL*
hotel
.
Suppose
you
and
your
friend
,
Dr.
Watson
,
come
round
and
lunch
*NL*
with
us
at
two
.
I
'll
be
able
to
tell
you
more
clearly
then
how
this
*NL*
thing
strikes
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
convenient
to
you
,
Watson
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perfectly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
may
expect
us
.
Shall
I
have
a
cab
called
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
prefer
to
walk
,
for
this
affair
has
flurried
me
rather
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
join
you
in
a
walk
,
with
pleasure
,
''
said
his
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
we
meet
again
at
two
o'clock
.
Au
revoir
,
and
good-morning
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
heard
the
steps
of
our
visitors
descend
the
stair
and
the
bang
of
the
*NL*
front
door
.
In
an
instant
Holmes
had
changed
from
the
languid
dreamer
to
*NL*
the
man
of
action
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
hat
and
boots
,
Watson
,
quick
!
Not
a
moment
to
lose
!
''
He
rushed
*NL*
into
his
room
in
his
dressing-gown
and
was
back
again
in
a
few
seconds
*NL*
in
a
frock-coat
.
We
hurried
together
down
the
stairs
and
into
the
*NL*
street
.
Dr.
Mortimer
and
Baskerville
were
still
visible
about
two
*NL*
hundred
yards
ahead
of
us
in
the
direction
of
Oxford
Street
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
run
on
and
stop
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
for
the
world
,
my
dear
Watson
.
I
am
perfectly
satisfied
with
your
*NL*
company
if
you
will
tolerate
mine
.
Our
friends
are
wise
,
for
it
is
*NL*
certainly
a
very
fine
morning
for
a
walk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
quickened
his
pace
until
we
had
decreased
the
distance
which
divided
*NL*
us
by
about
half
.
Then
,
still
keeping
a
hundred
yards
behind
,
we
*NL*
followed
into
Oxford
Street
and
so
down
Regent
Street
.
Once
our
friends
*NL*
stopped
and
stared
into
a
shop
window
,
upon
which
Holmes
did
the
*NL*
same
.
An
instant
afterwards
he
gave
a
little
cry
of
satisfaction
,
and
,
*NL*
following
the
direction
of
his
eager
eyes
,
I
saw
that
a
hansom
cab
with
*NL*
a
man
inside
which
had
halted
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
was
now
*NL*
proceeding
slowly
onward
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
our
man
,
Watson
!
Come
along
!
We
'll
have
a
good
look
at
him
,
if
*NL*
we
can
do
no
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
instant
I
was
aware
of
a
bushy
black
beard
and
a
pair
of
*NL*
piercing
eyes
turned
upon
us
through
the
side
window
of
the
cab
.
*NL*
Instantly
the
trapdoor
at
the
top
flew
up
,
something
was
screamed
to
*NL*
the
driver
,
and
the
cab
flew
madly
off
down
Regent
Street
.
Holmes
looked
*NL*
eagerly
round
for
another
,
but
no
empty
one
was
in
sight
.
Then
he
dashed
*NL*
in
wild
pursuit
amid
the
stream
of
the
traffic
,
but
the
start
was
too
*NL*
great
,
and
already
the
cab
was
out
of
sight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
now
!
''
said
Holmes
bitterly
as
he
emerged
panting
and
white
with
*NL*
vexation
from
the
tide
of
vehicles
.
``
Was
ever
such
bad
luck
and
such
*NL*
bad
management
,
too
?
Watson
,
Watson
,
if
you
are
an
honest
man
you
will
*NL*
record
this
also
and
set
it
against
my
successes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
was
the
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
an
idea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
spy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
was
evident
from
what
we
have
heard
that
Baskerville
has
been
*NL*
very
closely
shadowed
by
someone
since
he
has
been
in
town
.
How
else
*NL*
could
it
be
known
so
quickly
that
it
was
the
Northumberland
Hotel
which
*NL*
he
had
chosen
?
If
they
had
followed
him
the
first
day
I
argued
that
they
*NL*
would
follow
him
also
the
second
.
You
may
have
observed
that
I
twice
*NL*
strolled
over
to
the
window
while
Dr.
Mortimer
was
reading
his
legend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
remember
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
looking
out
for
loiterers
in
the
street
,
but
I
saw
none
.
We
*NL*
are
dealing
with
a
clever
man
,
Watson
.
This
matter
cuts
very
deep
,
and
*NL*
though
I
have
not
finally
made
up
my
mind
whether
it
is
a
benevolent
or
*NL*
a
malevolent
agency
which
is
in
touch
with
us
,
I
am
conscious
always
of
*NL*
power
and
design
.
When
our
friends
left
I
at
once
followed
them
in
the
*NL*
hopes
of
marking
down
their
invisible
attendant
.
So
wily
was
he
that
he
*NL*
had
not
trusted
himself
upon
foot
,
but
he
had
availed
himself
of
a
cab
*NL*
so
that
he
could
loiter
behind
or
dash
past
them
and
so
escape
their
*NL*
notice
.
His
method
had
the
additional
advantage
that
if
they
were
to
*NL*
take
a
cab
he
was
all
ready
to
follow
them
.
It
has
,
however
,
one
obvious
*NL*
disadvantage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
puts
him
in
the
power
of
the
cabman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
pity
we
did
not
get
the
number
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Watson
,
clumsy
as
I
have
been
,
you
surely
do
not
seriously
*NL*
imagine
that
I
neglected
to
get
the
number
?
No.
2704
is
our
man
.
But
*NL*
that
is
no
use
to
us
for
the
moment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
fail
to
see
how
you
could
have
done
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
observing
the
cab
I
should
have
instantly
turned
and
walked
in
the
*NL*
other
direction
.
I
should
then
at
my
leisure
have
hired
a
second
cab
*NL*
and
followed
the
first
at
a
respectful
distance
,
or
,
better
still
,
have
*NL*
driven
to
the
Northumberland
Hotel
and
waited
there
.
When
our
unknown
*NL*
had
followed
Baskerville
home
we
should
have
had
the
opportunity
of
*NL*
playing
his
own
game
upon
himself
and
seeing
where
he
made
for
.
As
*NL*
it
is
,
by
an
indiscreet
eagerness
,
which
was
taken
advantage
of
with
*NL*
extraordinary
quickness
and
energy
by
our
opponent
,
we
have
betrayed
*NL*
ourselves
and
lost
our
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
been
sauntering
slowly
down
Regent
Street
during
this
*NL*
conversation
,
and
Dr.
Mortimer
,
with
his
companion
,
had
long
vanished
in
*NL*
front
of
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
object
in
our
following
them
,
''
said
Holmes
.
``
The
shadow
has
*NL*
departed
and
will
not
return
.
We
must
see
what
further
cards
we
have
*NL*
in
our
hands
and
play
them
with
decision
.
Could
you
swear
to
that
man
's
*NL*
face
within
the
cab
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
swear
only
to
the
beard

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
could
I
--
from
which
I
gather
that
in
all
probability
it
was
*NL*
a
false
one

A
clever
man
upon
so
delicate
an
errand
has
no
use
for
a
*NL*
beard
save
to
conceal
his
features

Come
in
here

Watson

*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
into
one
of
the
district
messenger
offices
,
where
he
was
*NL*
warmly
greeted
by
the
manager
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
A
lad
of
fourteen
,
with
a
bright

keen
face

had
obeyed
the
summons
*NL*
of
the
manager

He
stood
now
gazing
with
great
reverence
at
the
famous

Three

*NL*
*NL*
Sherlock
Holmes
had
,
in
a
very
remarkable
degree
,
the
power
of
detaching
*NL*
his
mind
at
will
.
For
two
hours
the
strange
business
in
which
we
had
*NL*
been
involved
appeared
to
be
forgotten
,
and
he
was
entirely
absorbed
in
*NL*
the
pictures
of
the
modern
Belgian
masters
.
He
would
talk
of
nothing
*NL*
but
art
,
of
which
he
had
the
crudest
ideas
,
from
our
leaving
the
gallery
*NL*
until
we
found
ourselves
at
the
Northumberland
Hotel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
Henry
Baskerville
is
upstairs
expecting
you

said
the
clerk

He
*NL*
asked

up

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

*NL*
*NL*
The
book
showed
that
two

had
been
added
after
that
of

One
was
Theophilus

furious
was

it

We
had
a

together

It
was
in

repaired

ample

I.
``
I
do
not
know
how
I

better

*NL*
*NL*

And
you
will
report
very
carefully

Holmes
.
``
When

comes

I
will
direct
how

by

Saturday
all
might

Would
that
suit

Then
on

We
had
risen
to
depart
when
Baskerville
gave
a
cry
,
of
triumph
,
and
*NL*
diving
into
one
of
the
corners
of
the
room
he
drew
a
brown
boot
from
*NL*
under
a
cabinet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
missing
boot
!
''
he
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
all
our
difficulties
vanish
as
easily
!

said
Sherlock
Holmes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
is
a
very
singular
thing

Dr.
Mortimer
remarked
.
``
I
searched
*NL*
this
room
carefully
before
lunch

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
did
I

said
Baskerville
.
``
Every
inch
of
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
certainly
no
boot
in
it
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
that
case
the
waiter
must
have
placed
it
there
while
we
were
*NL*
lunching

*NL*
*NL*
The
German
was
sent
for
but
professed
to
know
nothing
of
the
matter
,
*NL*
nor
could
any
inquiry
clear
it
up
.
Another
item
had
been
added
to
that
*NL*
constant
and
apparently
purposeless
series
of
small
mysteries
which
had
*NL*
succeeded
each
other
so
rapidly
.
Setting
aside
the
whole
grim
story
of
*NL*
Sir
Charles
's
death
,
we
had
a
line
of
inexplicable
incidents
all
within
*NL*
the
limits
of
two
days
,
which
included
the
receipt
of
the
printed
*NL*
letter
,
the
black-bearded
spy
in
the
hansom
,
the
loss
of
the
new
brown
*NL*
boot
,
the
loss
of
the
old
black
boot
,
and
now
the
return
of
the
new
*NL*
brown
boot
.
Holmes
sat
in
silence
in
the
cab
as
we
drove
back
to
Baker
*NL*
Street
,
and
I
knew
from
his
drawn
brows
and
keen
face
that
his
mind
,
*NL*
like
my
own
,
was
busy
in
endeavouring
to
frame
some
scheme
into
which
*NL*
all
these
strange
and
apparently
disconnected
episodes
could
be
fitted
.
*NL*
All
afternoon
and
late
into
the
evening
he
sat
lost
in
tobacco
and
*NL*
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
before
dinner
two
telegrams
were
handed
in
.
The
first
ran
:
*NL*
*NL*

just
heard
that

*NL*

The

we
drove
down

there

two

scratched
his

Well

he

altogether
such
an

I

put

Sir

Mr.

negative

One

Mr.

not

I
really

*NL*
friend
's
questions
.
``
I
can
swear
to
one
thing
,
and
that
is
that
we
*NL*
have
not
been
shadowed
during
the
last
two
days
.
We
have
never
gone
*NL*
out
without
keeping
a
sharp
watch
,
and
no
one
could
have
escaped
our
*NL*
notice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
always
kept
together
,
I
presume
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Except
yesterday
afternoon
.
I
usually
give
up
one
day
to
pure
amusement
*NL*
when
I
come
to
town
,
so
I
spent
it
at
the
Museum
of
the
College
of
*NL*
Surgeons
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
went
to
look
at
the
folk
in
the
park
,
''
said
Baskerville
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
we
had
no
trouble
of
any
kind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
imprudent
,
all
the
same
,
''
said
Holmes
,
shaking
his
head
and
*NL*
looking
very
grave
.
``
I
beg
,
Sir
Henry
,
that
you
will
not
go
about
alone
.
*NL*
Some
great
misfortune
will
befall
you
if
you
do
.
Did
you
get
your
other
*NL*
boot
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
it
is
gone
forever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
.
That
is
very
interesting
.
Well
,
good-bye
,
''
he
added
as
the
*NL*
train
began
to
glide
down
the
platform
.
``
Bear
in
mind
,
Sir
Henry
,
one
of
*NL*
the
phrases
in
that
queer
old
legend
which
Dr.
Mortimer
has
read
to
us
,
*NL*
and
avoid
the
moor
in
those
hours
of
darkness
when
the
powers
of
evil
*NL*
are
exalted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
looked
back
at
the
platform
when
we
had
left
it
far
behind
and
saw
the
*NL*
tall
,
austere
figure
of
Holmes
standing
motionless
and
gazing
after
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
journey
was
a
swift
and
pleasant
one
,
and
I
spent
it
in
making
the
*NL*
more
intimate
acquaintance
of
my
two
companions
and
in
playing
with
*NL*
Dr.
Mortimer
's
spaniel
.
In
a
very
few
hours
the
brown
earth
had
*NL*
become
ruddy
,
the
brick
had
changed
to
granite
,
and
red
cows
grazed
in
*NL*
well-hedged
fields
where
the
lush
grasses
and
more
luxuriant
vegetation
*NL*
spoke
of
a
richer
,
if
a
damper
,
climate
.
Young
Baskerville
stared
*NL*
eagerly
out
of
the
window
and
cried
aloud
with
delight
as
he
recognized
*NL*
the
familiar
features
of
the
Devon
scenery
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
been
over
a
good
part
of
the
world
since
I
left
it
,
Dr.
Watson
,
''
*NL*
said
he
;
``
but
I
have
never
seen
a
place
to
compare
with
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
saw
a
Devonshire
man
who
did
not
swear
by
his
county
,
''
I
*NL*
remarked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
depends
upon
the
breed
of
men
quite
as
much
as
on
the
county
,
''
said
*NL*
Dr.
Mortimer
.
``
A
glance
at
our
friend
here
reveals
the
rounded
head
of
*NL*
the
Celt
,
which
carries
inside
it
the
Celtic
enthusiasm
and
power
*NL*
of
attachment
.
Poor
Sir
Charles
's
head
was
of
a
very
rare
type
,
half
*NL*
Gaelic
,
half
Ivernian
in
its
characteristics
.
But
you
were
very
young
*NL*
when
you
last
saw
Baskerville
Hall
,
were
you
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
a
boy
in
my
teens
at
the
time
of
my
father
's
death
and
had
never
*NL*
seen
the
Hall
,
for
he
lived
in
a
little
cottage
on
the
South
Coast
.
*NL*
Thence
I
went
straight
to
a
friend
in
America
.
I
tell
you
it
is
all
as
*NL*
new
to
me
as
it
is
to
Dr.
Watson
,
and
I
'm
as
keen
as
possible
to
see
the
*NL*
moor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
?
Then
your
wish
is
easily
granted
,
for
there
is
your
first
*NL*
sight
of
the
moor
,
''
said
Dr.
Mortimer
,
pointing
out
of
the
carriage
*NL*
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
Over
the
green
squares
of
the
fields
and
the
low
curve
of
a
wood
there
*NL*
rose
in
the
distance
a
gray
,
melancholy
hill
,
with
a
strange
jagged
*NL*
summit
,
dim
and
vague
in
the
distance
,
like
some
fantastic
landscape
in
*NL*
a
dream
.
Baskerville
sat
for
a
long
time
,
his
eyes
fixed
upon
it
,
and
I
*NL*
read
upon
his
eager
face
how
much
it
meant
to
him
,
this
first
sight
of
*NL*
that
strange
spot
where
the
men
of
his
blood
had
held
sway
so
long
*NL*
and
left
their
mark
so
deep
.
There
he
sat
,
with
his
tweed
suit
and
his
*NL*
American
accent
,
in
the
corner
of
a
prosaic
railway-carriage
,
and
yet
as
*NL*
I
looked
at
his
dark
and
expressive
face
I
felt
more
than
ever
how
*NL*
true
a
descendant
he
was
of
that
long
line
of
high-blooded
,
fiery
,
*NL*
and
masterful
men
.
There
were
pride
,
valour
,
and
strength
in
his
thick
*NL*
brows
,
his
sensitive
nostrils
,
and
his
large
hazel
eyes
.
If
on
that
*NL*
forbidding
moor
a
difficult
and
dangerous
quest
should
lie
before
us
,
*NL*
this
was
at
least
a
comrade
for
whom
one
might
venture
to
take
a
risk
*NL*
with
the
certainty
that
he
would
bravely
share
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
train
pulled
up
at
a
small
wayside
station
and
we
all
descended
.
*NL*
Outside
,
beyond
the
low
,
white
fence
,
a
wagonette
with
a
pair
of
cobs
*NL*
was
waiting
.
Our
coming
was
evidently
a
great
event
,
for
station-master
*NL*
and
porters
clustered
round
us
to
carry
out
our
luggage
.
It
was
a
sweet
,
*NL*
simple
country
spot
,
but
I
was
surprised
to
observe
that
by
the
gate
*NL*
there
stood
two
soldierly
men
in
dark
uniforms
who
leaned
upon
their
*NL*
short
rifles
and
glanced
keenly
at
us
as
we
passed
.
The
coachman
,
a
*NL*
hard-faced
,
gnarled
little
fellow
,
saluted
Sir
Henry
Baskerville
,
and
in
*NL*
a
few
minutes
we
were
flying
swiftly
down
the
broad
,
white
road
.
Rolling
*NL*
pasture
lands
curved
upward
on
either
side
of
us
,
and
old
gabled
houses
*NL*
peeped
out
from
amid
the
thick
green
foliage
,
but
behind
the
peaceful
*NL*
and
sunlit
countryside
there
rose
ever
,
dark
against
the
evening
sky
,
*NL*
the
long
,
gloomy
curve
of
the
moor
,
broken
by
the
jagged
and
sinister
*NL*
hills
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
wagonette
swung
round
into
a
side
road
,
and
we
curved
upward
through
*NL*
deep
lanes
worn
by
centuries
of
wheels
,
high
banks
on
either
side
,
heavy
*NL*
with
dripping
moss
and
fleshy
hart
's
-
tongue
ferns
.
Bronzing
bracken
and
*NL*
mottled
bramble
gleamed
in
the
light
of
the
sinking
sun
.
Still
steadily
*NL*
rising
,
we
passed
over
a
narrow
granite
bridge
and
skirted
a
noisy
*NL*
stream
which
gushed
swiftly
down
,
foaming
and
roaring
amid
the
gray
*NL*
boulders
.
Both
road
and
stream
wound
up
through
a
valley
dense
with
*NL*
scrub
oak
and
fir
.
At
every
turn
Baskerville
gave
an
exclamation
of
*NL*
delight
,
looking
eagerly
about
him
and
asking
countless
questions
.
To
*NL*
his
eyes
all
seemed
beautiful
,
but
to
me
a
tinge
of
melancholy
lay
upon
*NL*
the
countryside
,
which
bore
so
clearly
the
mark
of
the
waning
year
.
*NL*
Yellow
leaves
carpeted
the
lanes
and
fluttered
down
upon
us
as
we
*NL*
passed
.
The
rattle
of
our
wheels
died
away
as
we
drove
through
drifts
of
*NL*
rotting
vegetation
--
sad
gifts
,
as
it
seemed
to
me
,
for
Nature
to
throw
*NL*
before
the
carriage
of
the
returning
heir
of
the
Baskervilles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Halloa
!
''
cried
Dr.
Mortimer
,
``
what
is
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
steep
curve
of
heath-clad
land
,
an
outlying
spur
of
the
moor
,
lay
in
*NL*
front
of
us
.
On
the
summit
,
hard
and
clear
like
an
equestrian
statue
*NL*
upon
its
pedestal
,
was
a
mounted
soldier
,
dark
and
stern
,
his
rifle
*NL*
poised
ready
over
his
forearm
.
He
was
watching
the
road
along
which
we
*NL*
travelled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
this
,
Perkins
?
''
asked
Dr.
Mortimer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
driver
half
turned
in
his
seat
.
``
There
's
a
convict
escaped
from
*NL*
Princetown
,
sir
.
He
's
been
out
three
days
now
,
and
the
warders
watch
*NL*
every
road
and
every
station
,
but
they
've
had
no
sight
of
him
yet
.
The
*NL*
farmers
about
here
do
n't
like
it
,
sir
,
and
that
's
a
fact
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
understand
that
they
get
five
pounds
if
they
can
give
*NL*
information
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
but
the
chance
of
five
pounds
is
but
a
poor
thing
compared
*NL*
to
the
chance
of
having
your
throat
cut
.
You
see
,
it
is
n't
like
any
*NL*
ordinary
convict
.
This
is
a
man
that
would
stick
at
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
he
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
Selden
,
the
Notting
Hill
murderer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
remembered
the
case
well
,
for
it
was
one
in
which
Holmes
had
taken
an
*NL*
interest
on
account
of
the
peculiar
ferocity
of
the
crime
and
the
*NL*
wanton
brutality
which
had
marked
all
the
actions
of
the
assassin
.
The
*NL*
commutation
of
his
death
sentence
had
been
due
to
some
doubts
as
to
his
*NL*
complete
sanity
,
so
atrocious
was
his
conduct
.
Our
wagonette
had
topped
*NL*
a
rise
and
in
front
of
us
rose
the
huge
expanse
of
the
moor
,
mottled
*NL*
with
gnarled
and
craggy
cairns
and
tors
.
A
cold
wind
swept
down
from
*NL*
it
and
set
us
shivering
.
Somewhere
there
,
on
that
desolate
plain
,
was
*NL*
lurking
this
fiendish
man
,
hiding
in
a
burrow
like
a
wild
beast
,
his
*NL*
heart
full
of
malignancy
against
the
whole
race
which
had
cast
him
out
.
*NL*
It
needed
but
this
to
complete
the
grim
suggestiveness
of
the
barren
*NL*
waste
,
the
chilling
wind
,
and
the
darkling
sky
.
Even
Baskerville
fell
*NL*
silent
and
pulled
his
overcoat
more
closely
around
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
left
the
fertile
country
behind
and
beneath
us
.
We
looked
back
on
*NL*
it
now
,
the
slanting
rays
of
a
low
sun
turning
the
streams
to
threads
of
*NL*
gold
and
glowing
on
the
red
earth
new
turned
by
the
plough
and
the
broad
*NL*
tangle
of
the
woodlands
.
The
road
in
front
of
us
grew
bleaker
and
wilder
*NL*
over
huge
russet
and
olive
slopes
,
sprinkled
with
giant
boulders
.
Now
*NL*
and
then
we
passed
a
moorland
cottage
,
walled
and
roofed
with
stone
,
*NL*
with
no
creeper
to
break
its
harsh
outline
.
Suddenly
we
looked
down
into
*NL*
a
cuplike
depression
,
patched
with
stunted
oaks
and
firs
which
had
been
*NL*
twisted
and
bent
by
the
fury
of
years
of
storm
.
Two
high
,
narrow
towers
*NL*
rose
over
the
trees
.
The
driver
pointed
with
his
whip
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Baskerville
Hall
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Its
master
had
risen
and
was
staring
with
flushed
cheeks
and
shining
*NL*
eyes
.
A
few
minutes
later
we
had
reached
the
lodge-gates
,
a
maze
of
*NL*
fantastic
tracery
in
wrought
iron
,
with
weather-bitten
pillars
on
either
*NL*
side
,
blotched
with
lichens
,
and
surmounted
by
the
boars
'
heads
of
the
*NL*
Baskervilles
.
The
lodge
was
a
ruin
of
black
granite
and
bared
ribs
of
*NL*
rafters
,
but
facing
it
was
a
new
building
,
half
constructed
,
the
first
*NL*
fruit
of
Sir
Charles
's
South
African
gold
.
*NL*
*NL*
Through
the
gateway
we
passed
into
the
avenue
,
where
the
wheels
were
*NL*
again
hushed
amid
the
leaves
,
and
the
old
trees
shot
their
branches
in
a
*NL*
sombre
tunnel
over
our
heads
.
Baskerville
shuddered
as
he
looked
up
*NL*
the
long
,
dark
drive
to
where
the
house
glimmered
like
a
ghost
at
the
*NL*
farther
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
it
here
?
''
he
asked
in
a
low
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
the
yew
alley
is
on
the
other
side
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
heir
glanced
round
with
a
gloomy
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
no
wonder
my
uncle
felt
as
if
trouble
were
coming
on
him
in
such
a
*NL*
place
as
this
,
''
said
he
.
``
It
's
enough
to
scare
any
man
.
I
'll
have
a
row
*NL*
of
electric
lamps
up
here
inside
of
six
months
,
and
you
wo
n't
know
it
*NL*
again
,
with
a
thousand
candle-power
Swan
and
Edison
right
here
in
front
*NL*
of
the
hall
door
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
avenue
opened
into
a
broad
expanse
of
turf
,
and
the
house
lay
before
*NL*
us
.
In
the
fading
light
I
could
see
that
the
centre
was
a
heavy
block
*NL*
of
building
from
which
a
porch
projected
.
The
whole
front
was
draped
in
*NL*
ivy
,
with
a
patch
clipped
bare
here
and
there
where
a
window
or
a
coat
*NL*
of
arms
broke
through
the
dark
veil
.
From
this
central
block
rose
the
*NL*
twin
towers
,
ancient
,
crenelated
,
and
pierced
with
many
loopholes
.
To
*NL*
right
and
left
of
the
turrets
were
more
modern
wings
of
black
granite
.
*NL*
A
dull
light
shone
through
heavy
mullioned
windows
,
and
from
the
high
*NL*
chimneys
which
rose
from
the
steep
,
high-angled
roof
there
sprang
a
*NL*
single
black
column
of
smoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Welcome
,
Sir
Henry
!
Welcome
to
Baskerville
Hall
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
tall
man
had
stepped
from
the
shadow
of
the
porch
to
open
the
door
of
*NL*
the
wagonette
.
The
figure
of
a
woman
was
silhouetted
against
the
yellow
*NL*
light
of
the
hall
.
She
came
out
and
helped
the
man
to
hand
down
our
*NL*
bags
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
mind
my
driving
straight
home
,
Sir
Henry
?
''
said
Dr.
Mortimer
.
*NL*
``
My
wife
is
expecting
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
you
will
stay
and
have
some
dinner
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
must
go

I
shall
probably
find
some
work
awaiting
me

I
would
*NL*
stay

you
over
the
house

but
Barrymore
will
be
a

The
wheels
died
away
down
the
drive
while
Sir
Henry
and
I
turned
*NL*
into
the
hall
,
and
the
door
clanged
heavily
behind
us
.
It
was
a
fine
*NL*
apartment
in
which
we
found
ourselves
,
large
,
lofty
,
and
heavily
*NL*
raftered
with
huge
baulks
of
age-blackened
oak
.
In
the
great
*NL*
old-fashioned
fireplace
behind
the
high
iron
dogs
a
log-fire
crackled
*NL*
and
snapped
.
Sir
Henry
and
I
held
out
our
hands
to
it
,
for
we
were
numb
*NL*
from
our
long
drive
.
Then
we
gazed
round
us
at
the
high
,
thin
window
*NL*
of
old
stained
glass
,
the
oak
panelling
,
the
stags
'
heads
,
the
coats
*NL*
of
arms
upon
the
walls
,
all
dim
and
sombre
in
the
subdued
light
of
the
*NL*
central
lamp
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
just
as
I
imagined
it
,
''
said
Sir
Henry
.
``
Is
it
not
the
very
*NL*
picture
of
an
old
family
home
?
To
think
that
this
should
be
the
same
*NL*
hall
in
which
for
five
hundred
years
my
people
have
lived
.
It
strikes
me
*NL*
solemn
to
think
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
saw
his
dark
face
lit
up
with
a
boyish
enthusiasm
as
he
gazed
about
*NL*
him
.
The
light
beat
upon
him
where
he
stood
,
but
long
shadows
trailed
*NL*
down
the
walls
and
hung
like
a
black
canopy
above
him
.
Barrymore
had
*NL*
returned
from
taking
our
luggage
to
our
rooms
.
He
stood
in
front
of
*NL*
us
now
with
the
subdued
manner
of
a
well-trained
servant
.
He
was
a
*NL*
remarkable-looking
man
,
tall
,
handsome
,
with
a
square
black
beard
and
*NL*
pale
,
distinguished
features
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*

In

My

I
will
be
happy
,
Sir

,
to
stay
with
you
until
you
have
*NL*
made
your
fresh
arrangements
,
but
you
will
understand
that
under
the
new

conditions
this
house
will
require
a
considerable
staff

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
new
conditions
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only
meant
,
sir
,
that
Sir
Charles
led
a
very
retired
life
,
and
we
*NL*
were
able
to
look
after
his
wants

You
would

naturally

wish
to
have

more

so
you
will
need
changes
in
your
household

*NL*

Do

quite
convenient

*NL*
*NL*
``
But

been

several
generations

not

I
should
be
sorry
to
begin
my
life
here
by
breaking
an
old
family
*NL*
connection
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
seemed
to
discern
some
signs
of
emotion
upon
the
butler
's
white
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
feel
that
also
,
sir
,
and
so
does
my
wife
.
But
to
tell
the
truth
,
sir
,
*NL*
we
were
both
very
much
attached
to
Sir
Charles
,
and
his
death
gave
us
*NL*
a
shock
and
made
these
surroundings
very
painful
to
us
.
I
fear
that
we
*NL*
shall
never
again
be
easy
in
our
minds
at
Baskerville
Hall
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
do
you
intend
to
do
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
doubt
,
sir
,
that
we
shall
succeed
in
establishing
ourselves
*NL*
in
some
business
.
Sir
Charles
's
generosity
has
given
us
the
means
to
do
*NL*
so
.
And
now
,
sir
,
perhaps
I
had
best
show
you
to
your
rooms
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
square
balustraded
gallery
ran
round
the
top
of
the
old
hall
,
*NL*
approached
by
a
double
stair
.
From
this
central
point
two
long
corridors
*NL*
extended
the
whole
length
of
the
building
,
from
which
all
the
bedrooms
*NL*
opened
.
My
own
was
in
the
same
wing
as
Baskerville
's
and
almost
next
*NL*
door
to
it
.
These
rooms
appeared
to
be
much
more
modern
than
the
*NL*
central
part
of
the
house
,
and
the
bright
paper
and
numerous
candles
*NL*
did
something
to
remove
the
sombre
impression
which
our
arrival
had
left
*NL*
upon
my
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
dining-room
which
opened
out
of
the
hall
was
a
place
of
shadow
*NL*
and
gloom
.
It
was
a
long
chamber
with
a
step
separating
the
dais
where
*NL*
the
family
sat
from
the
lower
portion
reserved
for
their
dependents
.
*NL*
At
one
end
a
minstrel
's
gallery
overlooked
it
.
Black
beams
shot
across
*NL*
above
our
heads
,
with
a
smoke-darkened
ceiling
beyond
them
.
With
rows
of
*NL*
flaring
torches
to
light
it
up
,
and
the
colour
and
rude
hilarity
of
*NL*
an
old-time
banquet
,
it
might
have
softened
;
but
now
,
when
two
*NL*
black-clothed
gentlemen
sat
in
the
little
circle
of
light
thrown
by
a
*NL*
shaded
lamp
,
one
's
voice
became
hushed
and
one
's
spirit
subdued
.
A
*NL*
dim
line
of
ancestors
,
in
every
variety
of
dress
,
from
the
Elizabethan
*NL*
knight
to
the
buck
of
the
Regency
,
stared
down
upon
us
and
daunted
us
by
*NL*
their
silent
company
.
We
talked
little
,
and
I
for
one
was
glad
when
the
*NL*
meal
was
over
and
we
were
able
to
retire
into
the
modern
billiard-room
*NL*
and
smoke
a
cigarette
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
word
,
it
is
n't
a
very
cheerful
place
,
''
said
Sir
Henry
.
``
I
suppose
*NL*
one
can
tone
down
to
it
,
but
I
feel
a
bit
out
of
the
picture
at
present
.
*NL*
I
do
n't
wonder
that
my
uncle
got
a
little
jumpy
if
he
lived
all
alone
*NL*
in
such
a
house
as
this
.
However
,
if
it
suits
you
,
we
will
retire
early
*NL*
tonight
,
and
perhaps
things
may
seem
more
cheerful
in
the
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
drew
aside
my
curtains
before
I
went
to
bed
and
looked
out
from
my
*NL*
window
.
It
opened
upon
the
grassy
space
which
lay
in
front
of
the
hall
*NL*
door
.
Beyond
,
two
copses
of
trees
moaned
and
swung
in
a
rising
wind
.
A
*NL*
half
moon
broke
through
the
rifts
of
racing
clouds
.
In
its
cold
light
I
*NL*
saw
beyond
the
trees
a
broken
fringe
of
rocks
,
and
the
long
,
low
curve
*NL*
of
the
melancholy
moor
.
I
closed
the
curtain
,
feeling
that
my
last
*NL*
impression
was
in
keeping
with
the
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
it
was
not
quite
the
last
.
I
found
myself
weary
and
yet
wakeful
,
*NL*
tossing
restlessly
from
side
to
side
,
seeking
for
the
sleep
which
would
*NL*
not
come
.
Far
away
a
chiming
clock
struck
out
the
quarters
of
the
*NL*
hours
,
but
otherwise
a
deathly
silence
lay
upon
the
old
house
.
And
then
*NL*
suddenly
,
in
the
very
dead
of
the
night
,
there
came
a
sound
to
my
*NL*
ears
,
clear
,
resonant
,
and
unmistakable
.
It
was
the
sob
of
a
woman
,
the
*NL*
muffled
,
strangling
gasp
of
one
who
is
torn
by
an
uncontrollable
sorrow
.
*NL*
I
sat
up
in
bed
and
listened
intently
.
The
noise
could
not
have
been
*NL*
far
away
and
was
certainly
in
the
house
.
For
half
an
hour
I
waited
with
*NL*
every
nerve
on
the
alert
,
but
there
came
no
other
sound
save
the
chiming
*NL*
clock
and
the
rustle
of
the
ivy
on
the
wall
.

The

Merripit
House

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
fresh
beauty
of
the
following
morning
did
something
to
efface
from
*NL*
our
minds
the
grim
and
gray
impression
which
had
been
left
upon
both
of
*NL*
us
by
our
first
experience
of
Baskerville
Hall
.
As
Sir
Henry
and
I
sat
*NL*
at
breakfast
the
sunlight
flooded
in
through
the
high
mullioned
windows
,
*NL*
throwing
watery
patches
of
colour
from
the
coats
of
arms
which
covered
*NL*
them
.
The
dark
panelling
glowed
like
bronze
in
the
golden
rays
,
and
it
*NL*
was
hard
to
realize
that
this
was
indeed
the
chamber
which
had
struck
*NL*
such
a
gloom
into
our
souls
upon
the
evening
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
guess
it
is
ourselves
and
not
the
house
that
we
have
to
blame
!
''
said
*NL*
the
baronet
.
``
We
were
tired
with
our
journey
and
chilled
by
our
drive
,
*NL*
so
we
took
a
gray
view
of
the
place
.
Now
we
are
fresh
and
well
,
so
it
is
*NL*
all
cheerful
once
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
it
was
not
entirely
a
question
of
imagination
,
''
I
answered
.
*NL*
``
Did
you
,
for
example
,
happen
to
hear
someone
,
a
woman
I
think
,
sobbing
*NL*
in
the
night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
curious
,
for
I
did
when
I
was
half
asleep
fancy
that
I
heard
*NL*
something
of
the
sort
.
I
waited
quite
a
time
,
but
there
was
no
more
of
*NL*
it
,
so
I
concluded
that
it
was
all
a
dream
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
heard
it
distinctly
,
and
I
am
sure
that
it
was
really
the
sob
of
a
*NL*
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
ask
about
this
right
away
.
''
He
rang
the
bell
and
asked
*NL*
Barrymore
whether
he
could
account
for
our
experience
.
It
seemed
to
me
*NL*
that
the
pallid
features
of
the
butler
turned
a
shade
paler
still
as
he
*NL*
listened
to
his
master
's
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
only
two
women
in
the
house
,
Sir
Henry
,
''
he
answered
.
``
One
is
*NL*
the
scullery-maid
,
who
sleeps
in
the
other
wing
.
The
other
is
my
wife
,
*NL*
and
I
can
answer
for
it
that
the
sound
could
not
have
come
from
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
he
lied
as
he
said
it
,
for
it
chanced
that
after
breakfast
I
met
*NL*
Mrs.
Barrymore
in
the
long
corridor
with
the
sun
full
upon
her
face
.
She
*NL*
was
a
large
,
impassive
,
heavy-featured
woman
with
a
stern
set
expression
*NL*
of
mouth
.
But
her
telltale
eyes
were
red
and
glanced
at
me
from
between
*NL*
swollen
lids
.
It
was
she
,
then
,
who
wept
in
the
night
,
and
if
she
did
so
*NL*
her
husband
must
know
it
.
Yet
he
had
taken
the
obvious
risk
of
discovery
*NL*
in
declaring
that
it
was
not
so
.
Why
had
he
done
this
?
And
why
did
she
*NL*
weep
so
bitterly
?
Already
round
this
pale-faced
,
handsome
,
black-bearded
*NL*
man
there
was
gathering
an
atmosphere
of
mystery
and
of
gloom
.
It
was
he
*NL*
who
had
been
the
first
to
discover
the
body
of
Sir
Charles
,
and
we
had
*NL*
only
his
word
for
all
the
circumstances
which
led
up
to
the
old
man
's
*NL*
death
.
Was
it
possible
that
it
was
Barrymore
,
after
all
,
whom
we
had
*NL*
seen
in
the
cab
in
Regent
Street
?
The
beard
might
well
have
been
the
*NL*
same
.
The
cabman
had
described
a
somewhat
shorter
man
,
but
such
an
*NL*
impression
might
easily
have
been
erroneous
.
How
could
I
settle
the
*NL*
point
forever
?
Obviously
the
first
thing
to
do
was
to
see
the
Grimpen
*NL*
postmaster
and
find
whether
the
test
telegram
had
really
been
placed
in
*NL*
Barrymore
's
own
hands
.
Be
the
answer
what
it
might
,
I
should
at
least
*NL*
have
something
to
report
to
Sherlock
Holmes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Henry
had
numerous
papers
to
examine
after
breakfast
,
so
that
the
*NL*
time
was
propitious
for
my
excursion
.
It
was
a
pleasant
walk
of
four
*NL*
miles
along
the
edge
of
the
moor
,
leading
me
at
last
to
a
small
gray
*NL*
hamlet
,
in
which
two
larger
buildings
,
which
proved
to
be
the
inn
and
*NL*
the
house
of
Dr.
Mortimer
,
stood
high
above
the
rest
.
The
postmaster
,
*NL*
who
was
also
the
village
grocer
,
had
a
clear
recollection
of
the
*NL*
telegram
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
sir
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
had
the
telegram
delivered
to
Mr.
*NL*
Barrymore
exactly
as
directed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
delivered
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
boy
here
.
James
,
you
delivered
that
telegram
to
Mr.
Barrymore
at
the
*NL*
Hall
last
week
,
did
you
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
father
,
I
delivered
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Into
his
own
hands
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
he
was
up
in
the
loft
at
the
time
,
so
that
I
could
not
put
it
*NL*
into
his
own
hands
,
but
I
gave
it
into
Mrs.
Barrymore
's
hands
,
and
she
*NL*
promised
to
deliver
it
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
see
Mr.
Barrymore
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
;
I
tell
you
he
was
in
the
loft
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
did
n't
see
him
,
how
do
you
know
he
was
in
the
loft
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
surely
his
own
wife
ought
to
know
where
he
is
,
''
said
the
*NL*
postmaster
testily
.
``
Did
n't
he
get
the
telegram
?
If
there
is
any
mistake
*NL*
it
is
for
Mr.
Barrymore
himself
to
complain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
hopeless
to
pursue
the
inquiry
any
farther
,
but
it
was
clear
*NL*
that
in
spite
of
Holmes
's
ruse
we
had
no
proof
that
Barrymore
had
not
*NL*
been
in
London
all
the
time
.
Suppose
that
it
were
so
--
suppose
that
the
*NL*
same
man
had
been
the
last
who
had
seen
Sir
Charles
alive
,
and
the
first
*NL*
to
dog
the
new
heir
when
he
returned
to
England
.
What
then
?
Was
he
the
*NL*
agent
of
others
or
had
he
some
sinister
design
of
his
own
?
What
interest
*NL*
could
he
have
in
persecuting
the
Baskerville
family
?
I
thought
of
the
*NL*
strange
warning
clipped
out
of
the
leading
article
of
the
Times
.
Was
*NL*
that
his
work
or
was
it
possibly
the
doing
of
someone
who
was
bent
upon
*NL*
counteracting
his
schemes
?
The
only
conceivable
motive
was
that
which
*NL*
had
been
suggested
by
Sir
Henry
,
that
if
the
family
could
be
scared
away
*NL*
a
comfortable
and
permanent
home
would
be
secured
for
the
Barrymores
.
*NL*
But
surely
such
an
explanation
as
that
would
be
quite
inadequate
to
*NL*
account
for
the
deep
and
subtle
scheming
which
seemed
to
be
weaving
an
*NL*
invisible
net
round
the
young
baronet
.
Holmes
himself
had
said
that
*NL*
no
more
complex
case
had
come
to
him
in
all
the
long
series
of
his
*NL*
sensational
investigations
.
I
prayed
,
as
I
walked
back
along
the
gray
,
*NL*
lonely
road
,
that
my
friend
might
soon
be
freed
from
his
preoccupations
*NL*
and
able
to
come
down
to
take
this
heavy
burden
of
responsibility
from
*NL*
my
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
my
thoughts
were
interrupted
by
the
sound
of
running
feet
*NL*
behind
me
and
by
a
voice
which
called
me
by
name
.
I
turned
,
expecting
to
*NL*
see
Dr.
Mortimer
,
but
to
my
surprise
it
was
a
stranger
who
was
pursuing
*NL*
me
.
He
was
a
small
,
slim
,
clean-shaven
,
prim-faced
man
,
flaxen-haired
*NL*
and
leanjawed
,
between
thirty
and
forty
years
of
age
,
dressed
in
a
gray
*NL*
suit
and
wearing
a
straw
hat
.
A
tin
box
for
botanical
specimens
hung
*NL*
over
his
shoulder
and
he
carried
a
green
butterfly-net
in
one
of
his
*NL*
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
,
I
am
sure
,
excuse
my
presumption
,
Dr.
Watson
,
''
said
he
as
he
*NL*
came
panting
up
to
where
I
stood
.
``
Here
on
the
moor
we
are
homely
folk
*NL*
and
do
not
wait
for
formal
introductions
.
You
may
possibly
have
heard
*NL*
my
name
from
our
mutual
friend
,
Mortimer
.
I
am
Stapleton
,
of
Merripit
*NL*
House
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
net
and
box
would
have
told
me
as
much
,
''
said
I
,
``
for
I
knew
that
*NL*
Mr.
Stapleton
was
a
naturalist
.
But
how
did
you
know
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
calling
on
Mortimer
,
and
he
pointed
you
out
to
me
from
*NL*
the
window
of
his
surgery
as
you
passed
.
As
our
road
lay
the
same
way
I
*NL*
thought
that
I
would
overtake
you
and
introduce
myself
.
I
trust
that
Sir
*NL*
Henry
is
none
the
worse
for
his
journey
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
very
well
,

you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
were
all
rather
afraid
that
after
the
sad
death
of
Sir
Charles
the
*NL*
new
baronet
might
refuse
to
live
here
.
It
is
asking
much
of
a
wealthy
*NL*
man
to
come
down
and
bury
himself
in
a
place
of
this
kind
,
but
I
need
*NL*
not
tell
you
that
it
means
a
very
great
deal
to
the
countryside
.
Sir
*NL*
Henry
has
,
I
suppose
,
no
superstitious
fears
in
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
think
that
it
is
likely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
you
know
the
legend
of
the
fiend
dog
which
haunts
the
*NL*
family

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
heard
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
extraordinary
how
credulous
the
peasants
are
about
here

Any
*NL*
number
of
them
are
ready
to
swear
that
they
have
seen
such
a
creature
*NL*
upon
the
moor
.
''
He
spoke
with
a
smile
,
but
I
seemed
to
read
in
his
eyes
*NL*
that
he
took
the
matter
more
seriously
.
``
The
story
took
a
great
hold
*NL*
upon
the
imagination
of
Sir

I
have
no

that
it
led
to
*NL*
his
tragic
end

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
nerves
were
so
worked
up
that
the
appearance
of
any
dog
might
have
*NL*
had
a
fatal
effect
upon
his
diseased
heart
.
I
fancy
that
he
really
*NL*
did
see
something
of
the
kind
upon
that
last
night
in
the
yew
alley
.
I
*NL*
feared
that
some
disaster
might
occur
,
for
I
was
very
fond
of
the
old
*NL*
man
,
and
I
knew
that
his
heart
was
weak
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
did
you
know
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
friend
Mortimer
told
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
think
,
then

that
some
dog
pursued

Have

The
words
took
away
my
breath
for
an
instant
but
a
glance
at
the
placid
*NL*
face
and
steadfast
eyes
of
my
companion
showed
that
no
surprise
was
*NL*
intended
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
useless
for

said
he
.

When

told

me
your

he
could
not
deny
your
identity

If
you
are
here
,
then
it
*NL*
follows
that
Mr.

is
interesting
himself
in
the
matter

I
am
naturally
curious
to
know
what

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid

not

*NL*
``
May

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
can
not

*NL*
``
What
a

there
is
any
possible
way
in

can
be

service
to

trust
that

will
command

any
indication

nature

your

how
you
propose
to
*NL*
investigate
the

might
perhaps
even
now
give

some
aid

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
assure

simply
here
upon

need
no

*NL*
*NL*
``
Excellent

said
Stapleton
.
``

are
perfectly
right

be
wary

discreet

I

justly
reproved

I

an
unjustifiable
*NL*
intrusion

I
promise
you
that
I
will
not
mention

''
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
come
to
a
point
where
a
narrow
grassy
path
struck
off
from
the
*NL*
road
and
wound
away
across
the
moor
.
A
steep
,
boulder-sprinkled
hill
lay
*NL*
upon
the
right
which
had
in
bygone
days
been
cut
into
a
granite
quarry
.
*NL*
The
face
which
was
turned
towards
us
formed
a
dark
cliff
,
with
ferns
and
*NL*
brambles
growing
in
its
niches
.
From
over
a
distant
rise
there
floated
a
*NL*
gray
plume
of
smoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
moderate
walk
along
this
moor-path
brings
us
to
Merripit
House
,
''
*NL*
said
he
.
``
Perhaps
you
will
spare
an
hour
that
I
may
have
the
pleasure
of
*NL*
introducing
you
to
my
sister
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
first
thought
was
that
I
should
be
by
Sir
Henry
's
side
.
But
then
I
*NL*
remembered
the
pile
of
papers
and
bills
with
which
his
study
table
was
*NL*
littered
.
It
was
certain
that
I
could
not
help
with
those
.
And
Holmes
*NL*
had
expressly
said
that
I
should
study
the
neighbours
upon
the
moor
.
I
*NL*
accepted
Stapleton
's
invitation
,
and
we
turned
together
down
the
path
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
wonderful
place
,
the
moor
,
''
said
he
,
looking
round
over
the
*NL*
undulating
downs
,
long
green
rollers
,
with
crests
of
jagged
granite
*NL*
foaming
up
into
fantastic
surges
.
``
You
never
tire
of
the
moor
.
You
*NL*
can
not
think
the
wonderful
secrets
which
it
contains
.
It
is
so
vast
,
and
*NL*
so
barren
,
and
so
mysterious
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
it
well
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
only
been
here
two
years

The
residents
would
call
me
a
*NL*
newcomer
.
We
came
shortly
after
Sir
Charles
settled
.
But
my
tastes
led
*NL*
me
to
explore
every
part
of
the
country
round
,
and
I
should
think
that
*NL*
there
are
few
men
who
know
it
better
than
I
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
hard
to
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
hard

You
see
,
for
example
,
this
great
plain
to
the
north
here
*NL*
with
the
queer
hills
breaking
out
of
it

Do
you
observe
anything
*NL*
remarkable
about
that
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
a
rare
place
for
a
gallop

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
naturally
think
so

the
thought
has
cost
several
their
*NL*
lives
before
now
.
You
notice
those
bright
green
spots
scattered
thickly
*NL*
over
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
they
seem
more
fertile
than
the
rest

''
*NL*
*NL*
Stapleton
laughed
.
``
That
is
the
great
Grimpen
Mire
,
''
said
he
.
``
A
false
*NL*
step
yonder
means
death
to
man

beast

Only
yesterday
I
saw
one
of
the
*NL*
moor
ponies
wander
into
it
.
He
never
came
out
.
I
saw
his
head
for
quite
*NL*
a
long
time
craning
out
of
the
bog-hole
,
but
it
sucked
him
down
at
last

*NL*
Even
in
dry
seasons
it
is
a
danger
to
cross
it

after
these
autumn
*NL*
rains
it
is
an
awful
place

yet
I
can
find
my
way
to
the
very
heart

of
it

return
alive

By

is
another
of
those
miserable

ponies

*NL*
*NL*
Something
brown
was
rolling
and
tossing
among
the
green
sedges
.
Then
a
*NL*
long
,
agonized
,
writhing
neck
shot
upward
and
a
dreadful
cry
echoed
*NL*
over
the
moor

It
turned
me
cold
with
horror

my
companion

nerves

seemed
to
be
stronger

mine

*NL*

gone

he

The
mire

him

Two

in

way

going
there

dry

never

``
Halloa

I
cried

*NL*
*NL*
A
long
,
low
moan
,
indescribably
sad
,
swept
over
the
moor
.
It
filled
the
*NL*
whole
air
,
and
yet
it
was
impossible
to
say
whence
it
came

From
a
*NL*
dull
murmur
it
swelled
into
a
deep
roar

and
then
sank
back
into
a

melancholy

throbbing
murmur
once
again

looked
at

curious
expression

I
looked
round

of
fear

at
the
huge
swelling

plain

mottled
with
the
green

Nothing
stirred
over

the
vast
expanse

a

croaked
loudly

*NL*
A
small
fly
or
moth
had
fluttered
across
our
path
,
and
in
an
instant
*NL*
Stapleton
was
rushing
with
extraordinary
energy
and
speed
in
pursuit
of
*NL*
it
.
To
my
dismay
the
creature
flew
straight
for
the
great
mire
,
and
my
*NL*
acquaintance
never
paused
for
an
instant
,
bounding
from
tuft
to
tuft
*NL*
behind
it
,
his
green
net
waving
in
the
air
.
His
gray
clothes
and
jerky
,
*NL*
zigzag
,
irregular
progress
made
him
not
unlike
some
huge
moth
himself
.
*NL*
I
was
standing
watching
his
pursuit
with
a
mixture
of
admiration
for
his
*NL*
extraordinary
activity
and
fear
lest
he
should
lose
his
footing
in
the
*NL*
treacherous
mire
,
when
I
heard
the
sound
of
steps
and
,
turning
round
,
*NL*
found
a
woman
near
me
upon
the
path
.
She
had
come
from
the
direction
in
*NL*
which
the
plume
of
smoke
indicated
the
position
of
Merripit
House
,
but
*NL*
the
dip
of
the
moor
had
hid
her
until
she
was
quite
close
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
doubt
that
this
was
the
Miss
Stapleton
of
whom
I
had
*NL*
been
told
,
since
ladies
of
any
sort
must
be
few
upon
the
moor
,
and
I
*NL*
remembered
that
I
had
heard
someone
describe
her
as
being
a
beauty
.
The
*NL*
woman
who
approached
me
was
certainly
that
,
and
of
a
most
uncommon
type
.
*NL*
There
could
not
have
been
a
greater
contrast
between
brother
and
sister
,
*NL*
for
Stapleton
was
neutral
tinted
,
with
light
hair
and
gray
eyes
,
while
*NL*
she
was
darker
than
any
brunette
whom
I
have
seen
in
England
--
slim
,
*NL*
elegant
,
and
tall
.
She
had
a
proud
,
finely
cut
face
,
so
regular
that
it
*NL*
might
have
seemed
impassive
were
it
not
for
the
sensitive
mouth
and
the
*NL*
beautiful
dark
,
eager
eyes
.
With
her
perfect
figure
and
elegant
dress
*NL*
she
was
,
indeed
,
a
strange
apparition
upon
a
lonely
moorland
path
.
Her
*NL*
eyes
were
on
her
brother
as
I
turned
,
and
then
she
quickened
her
pace
*NL*
towards
me
.
I
had
raised
my
hat
and
was
about
to
make
some
explanatory
*NL*
remark
when
her
own
words
turned
all
my
thoughts
into
a
new
channel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
back
!
''
she
said
.
``
Go
straight
back
to
London
,
instantly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
only
stare
at
her
in
stupid
surprise
.
Her
eyes
blazed
at
me
,
and
*NL*
she
tapped
the
ground
impatiently
with
her
foot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
I
go
back
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
explain
.
''
She
spoke
in
a
low
,
eager
voice
,
with
a
curious
lisp
*NL*
in
her
utterance
.
``
But
for
God
's
sake
do
what
I
ask
you
.
Go
back
and
*NL*
never
set
foot
upon
the
moor
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
have
only
just
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Man
,
man
!
''
she
cried
.
``
Can
you
not
tell
when
a
warning
is
for
your
own
*NL*
good
?
Go
back
to
London

Start
tonight
!
Get
away
from
this
place
at
all
*NL*
costs
!
Hush
,
my
brother
is
coming
!
Not
a
word
of
what
I
have
said
.
Would
*NL*
you
mind
getting
that
orchid
for
me
among
the
mare
's
-
tails
yonder
?
We
*NL*
are
very
rich
in
orchids
on
the
moor
,
though
,
of
course
,
you
are
rather
*NL*
late
to
see
the
beauties
of
the
place

''
*NL*
*NL*
Stapleton
had
abandoned
the
chase
and
came
back
to
us
breathing
hard
and
*NL*
flushed
with
his
exertions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Halloa
,
Beryl
!
''
said
he
,
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
tone
of
his
*NL*
greeting
was
not
altogether
a
cordial
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Jack
,
you
are
very
hot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
was
chasing
a
Cyclopides

He
is
very
rare
and
seldom
found
in
*NL*
the
late
autumn
.
What
a
pity
that
I
should
have
missed
him
!
''
He
spoke
*NL*
unconcernedly
,
but
his
small
light
eyes
glanced
incessantly
from
the
*NL*
girl
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
introduced
yourselves
,
I
can
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

I
was
telling
Sir
Henry

was
rather
late
for
him
to
see
the
*NL*
true
beauties

the
moor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
who
do
you
think
this
is
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
imagine
that
it
must
be
Sir
Henry
Baskerville
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

no

''
said
I.
``
Only
a
humble
commoner
,
but
his
friend
.
My
name
is
*NL*
Dr.
Watson
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
flush
of
vexation
passed
over
her
expressive
face
.
``
We
have
been
*NL*
talking
at
cross
purposes
,
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
had
not
very
much
time
for
talk

''
her
brother
remarked
with
*NL*
the
same
questioning
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
talked
as
if
Dr.
Watson
were
a
resident
instead
of
being
merely
a
*NL*
visitor
,
''
said
she
.
``
It
can
not
much
matter
to
him
whether
it
is
early
*NL*
or
late
for
the
orchids
.
But
you
will
come
on
,
will
you
not
,
and
see
*NL*
Merripit
House
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
short
walk
brought
us
to
it
,
a
bleak
moorland
house
,
once
the
farm
*NL*
of
some
grazier
in
the
old
prosperous
days
,
but
now
put
into
repair
and
*NL*
turned
into
a
modern
dwelling
.
An
orchard
surrounded
it
,
but
the
trees
,
*NL*
as
is
usual
upon
the
moor
,
were
stunted
and
nipped
,
and
the
effect
of
*NL*
the
whole
place
was
mean
and
melancholy
.
We
were
admitted
by
a
strange
,
*NL*
wizened
,
rusty-coated
old
manservant
,
who
seemed
in
keeping
with
*NL*
the
house
.
Inside
,
however
,
there
were
large
rooms
furnished
with
an
*NL*
elegance
in
which
I
seemed
to
recognize
the
taste
of
the
lady
.
As
I
*NL*
looked
from
their
windows
at
the
interminable
granite-flecked
moor
*NL*
rolling
unbroken
to
the
farthest
horizon
I
could
not
but
marvel
at
what
*NL*
could
have
brought
this
highly
educated
man
and
this
beautiful
woman
to
*NL*
live
in
such
a
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Queer
spot
to
choose
,
is
it
not
?
''
said
he
as
if
in
answer
to
my
*NL*
thought
.
``
And
yet
we
manage
to
make
ourselves
fairly
happy
,
do
we
not
,
*NL*
Beryl
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
happy
,
''
said
she
,
but
there
was
no
ring
of
conviction
in
her
*NL*
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
a
school
,
''
said
Stapleton
.
``
It
was
in
the
north
country
.
The
work
*NL*
to
a
man
of
my
temperament
was
mechanical
and
uninteresting
,
but
the
*NL*
privilege
of
living
with
youth
,
of
helping
to
mould
those
young
minds
,
*NL*
and
of
impressing
them
with
one
's
own
character
and
ideals
was
very
dear
*NL*
to
me
.
However
,
the
fates
were
against
us
.
A
serious
epidemic
broke
out
*NL*
in
the
school
and
three
of
the
boys
died
.
It
never
recovered
from
the
*NL*
blow
,
and
much
of
my
capital
was
irretrievably
swallowed
up
.
And
yet
,
*NL*
if
it
were
not
for
the
loss
of
the
charming
companionship
of
the
boys
,
*NL*
I
could
rejoice
over
my
own
misfortune
,
for
,
with
my
strong
tastes
*NL*
for
botany
and
zoology
,
I
find
an
unlimited
field
of
work
here
,
and
my
*NL*
sister
is
as
devoted
to
Nature
as
I
am
.
All
this
,
Dr.
Watson
,
has
been
*NL*
brought
upon
your
head
by
your
expression
as
you
surveyed
the
moor
out
*NL*
of
our
window
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
certainly
did
cross
my
mind
that
it
might
be
a
little
dull
--
less
for
*NL*
you
,
perhaps
,
than
for
your
sister
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
I
am
never
dull
,
''
said
she
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
books
,
we
have
our
studies
,
and
we
have
interesting
neighbours

*NL*
Dr.
Mortimer
is

most
learned
man
in
his
own
line
.
Poor
Sir
Charles
was
*NL*
also
an
admirable
companion
.
We
knew
him
well
and
miss
him
more
than
*NL*
I
can
tell
.
Do
you
think
that
I
should
intrude
if
I
were
to
call
this
*NL*
afternoon
and
make
the
acquaintance
of
Sir
Henry
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
that
he
would
be
delighted

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
perhaps
you
would
mention
that
I
propose
to
do
so
.
We
may
in
*NL*
our
humble
way
do
something
to
make
things
more
easy
for
him
until
he
*NL*
becomes
accustomed
to
his
new
surroundings
.
Will
you
come
upstairs
,
Dr.
*NL*
Watson
,
and
inspect
my
collection
of
Lepidoptera
?
I
think
it
is
the
most
*NL*
complete
one
in
the
south-west
of
England
.
By
the
time
that
you
have
*NL*
looked
through
them
lunch
will
be
almost
ready
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
was
eager
to
get
back
to
my
charge
.
The
melancholy
of
the
moor
,
*NL*
the
death
of
the
unfortunate
pony
,
the
weird
sound
which
had
been
*NL*
associated
with
the
grim
legend
of
the
Baskervilles
,
all
these
things
*NL*
tinged
my
thoughts
with
sadness
.
Then
on
the
top
of
these
more
or
less
*NL*
vague
impressions
there
had
come
the
definite
and
distinct
warning
of
*NL*
Miss
Stapleton
,
delivered
with
such
intense
earnestness
that
I
could
*NL*
not
doubt
that
some
grave
and
deep
reason
lay
behind
it
.
I
resisted
*NL*
all
pressure
to
stay
for
lunch
,
and
I
set
off
at
once
upon
my
return
*NL*
journey
,
taking
the
grass-grown
path
by
which
we
had
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seems
,
however
,
that
there
must
have
been
some
short
cut
for
those
*NL*
who
knew
it
,
for
before
I
had
reached
the
road
I
was
astounded
to
see
*NL*
Miss
Stapleton
sitting
upon
a
rock
by
the
side
of
the
track
.
Her
face
*NL*
was
beautifully
flushed
with
her
exertions
and
she
held
her
hand
to
her
*NL*
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
run
all
the
way
in
order
to
cut
you
off

Dr.
Watson

said
she
.
*NL*
``
I

I
wanted
to

mistake

made
in
thinking

*NL*
An
expression
of
irresolution
passed
for
an
instant
over
her
face
,
but
*NL*
her
eyes
had
hardened
again
when
she
answered
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
make
too
much
of
it

Dr.
Watson

said
she

``
My
brother
and
I
*NL*
were
very
much
shocked
by
the
death
of
Sir
Charles
.
We
knew
him
very
*NL*
intimately
,
for
his
favourite
walk
was
over
the
moor
to
our
house
.
He
*NL*
was
deeply
impressed
with
the
curse
which
hung
over
the
family
,
and
when
*NL*
this
tragedy
came
I
naturally
felt
that
there
must
be
some
grounds
*NL*
for
the
fears
which
he
had
expressed
.
I
was
distressed
therefore
when
*NL*
another
member
of
the
family
came
down
to
live
here
,
and
I
felt
that
he
*NL*
should
be
warned
of
the
danger
which
he
will
run
.
That
was
all
which
I

intended
to
convey

has
always
been
fatal

Baskerville

October

MY
DEAR
HOLMES
:
My
previous
letters
*NL*
and
telegrams
have
kept
you
pretty
well
up
to
date
as
to
all
that
has
*NL*
occurred
in
this
most
God-forsaken
corner
of
the
world
.
The
longer
one
*NL*
stays
here
the
more
does
the
spirit
of
the
moor
sink
into
one
's
soul
,
*NL*
its
vastness
,
and
also
its
grim
charm
.
When
you
are
once
out
upon
its
*NL*
bosom
you
have
left
all
traces
of
modern
England
behind
you
,
but
,
on
the
*NL*
other
hand
,
you
are
conscious
everywhere
of
the
homes
and
the
work
of
*NL*
the
prehistoric
people
.
On
all
sides
of
you
as
you
walk
are
the
houses
*NL*
of
these
forgotten
folk
,
with
their
graves
and
the
huge
monoliths
which
*NL*
are
supposed
to
have
marked
their
temples
.
As
you
look
at
their
gray
*NL*
stone
huts
against
the
scarred
hillsides
you
leave
your
own
age
behind
*NL*
you
,
and
if
you
were
to
see
a
skin-clad
,
hairy
man
crawl
out
from
the
*NL*
low
door
fitting
a
flint-tipped
arrow
on
to
the
string
of
his
bow
,
you
*NL*
would
feel
that
his
presence
there
was
more
natural
than
your
own
.
The
*NL*
strange
thing
is
that
they
should
have
lived
so
thickly
on
what
must
*NL*
always
have
been
most
unfruitful
soil
.
I
am
no
antiquarian
,
but
I
could
*NL*
imagine
that
they
were
some
unwarlike
and
harried
race
who
were
forced
*NL*
to
accept
that
which
none
other
would
occupy
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
,
however
,
is
foreign
to
the
mission
on
which
you
sent
me
and
*NL*
will
probably
be
very
uninteresting
to
your
severely
practical
mind
.
*NL*
I
can
still
remember
your
complete
indifference
as
to
whether
the
sun
*NL*
moved
round
the
earth
or
the
earth
round
the
sun
.
Let
me
,
therefore
,
*NL*
return
to
the
facts
concerning
Sir
Henry
Baskerville
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
you
have
not
had
any
report
within
the
last
few
days
it
is
because
*NL*
up
to
today
there
was
nothing
of
importance
to
relate
.
Then
a
very
*NL*
surprising
circumstance
occurred
,
which
I
shall
tell
you
in
due
course
.
*NL*
But
,
first
of
all
,
I
must
keep
you
in
touch
with
some
of
the
other
*NL*
factors
in
the
situation
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
these
,
concerning
which
I
have
said
little
,
is
the
escaped
*NL*
convict
upon
the
moor
.
There
is
strong
reason
now
to
believe
that
he
*NL*
has
got
right
away
,
which
is
a
considerable
relief
to
the
lonely
*NL*
householders
of
this
district
.
A
fortnight
has
passed
since
his
flight
,
*NL*
during
which
he
has
not
been
seen
and
nothing
has
been
heard
of
him
.
It
*NL*
is
surely
inconceivable
that
he
could
have
held
out
upon
the
moor
during
*NL*
all
that
time
.
Of
course
,
so
far
as
his
concealment
goes
there
is
*NL*
no
difficulty
at
all
.
Any
one
of
these
stone
huts
would
give
him
a
*NL*
hiding-place
.
But
there
is
nothing
to
eat
unless
he
were
to
catch
and
*NL*
slaughter
one
of
the
moor
sheep
.
We
think
,
therefore
,
that
he
has
gone
,
*NL*
and
the
outlying
farmers
sleep
the
better
in
consequence
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
are
four
able-bodied
men
in
this
household
,
so
that
we
could
take
*NL*
good
care
of
ourselves
,
but
I
confess
that
I
have
had
uneasy
moments
*NL*
when
I
have
thought
of
the
Stapletons
.
They
live
miles
from
any
help
.
*NL*
There
are
one
maid
,
an
old
manservant
,
the
sister
,
and
the
brother
,
the
*NL*
latter
not
a
very
strong
man
.
They
would
be
helpless
in
the
hands
of
a
*NL*
desperate
fellow
like
this
Notting
Hill
criminal
if
he
could
once
effect
*NL*
an
entrance
.
Both
Sir
Henry
and
I
were
concerned
at
their
situation
,
and
*NL*
it
was
suggested
that
Perkins
the
groom
should
go
over
to
sleep
there
,
*NL*
but
Stapleton
would
not
hear
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fact
is
that
our
friend
,
the
baronet
,
begins
to
display
a
*NL*
considerable
interest
in
our
fair
neighbour
.
It
is
not
to
be
wondered
*NL*
at
,
for
time
hangs
heavily
in
this
lonely
spot
to
an
active
man
like
*NL*
him
,
and
she
is
a
very
fascinating
and
beautiful
woman
.
There
is
*NL*
something
tropical
and
exotic
about
her
which
forms
a
singular
contrast
*NL*
to
her
cool
and
unemotional
brother
.
Yet
he
also
gives
the
idea
of
*NL*
hidden
fires
.
He
has
certainly
a
very
marked
influence
over
her
,
for
*NL*
I
have
seen
her
continually
glance
at
him
as
she
talked
as
if
seeking
*NL*
approbation
for
what
she
said
.
I
trust
that
he
is
kind
to
her
.
There
is
*NL*
a
dry
glitter
in
his
eyes
and
a
firm
set
of
his
thin
lips
,
which
goes
*NL*
with
a
positive
and
possibly
a
harsh
nature
.
You
would
find
him
an
*NL*
interesting
study
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
over
to
call
upon
Baskerville
on
that
first
day
,
and
the
very
*NL*
next
morning
he
took
us
both
to
show
us
the
spot
where
the
legend
of
the
*NL*
wicked
Hugo
is
supposed
to
have
had
its
origin
.
It
was
an
excursion
of
*NL*
some
miles
across
the
moor
to
a
place
which
is
so
dismal
that
it
might
*NL*
have
suggested
the
story
.
We
found
a
short
valley
between
rugged
tors
*NL*
which
led
to
an
open
,
grassy
space
flecked
over
with
the
white
cotton
*NL*
grass
.
In
the
middle
of
it
rose
two
great
stones
,
worn
and
sharpened
at
*NL*
the
upper
end
until
they
looked
like
the
huge
corroding
fangs
of
some
*NL*
monstrous
beast
.
In
every
way
it
corresponded
with
the
scene
of
the
old
*NL*
tragedy
.
Sir
Henry
was
much
interested
and
asked
Stapleton
more
*NL*
than
once
whether
he
did
really
believe
in
the
possibility
of
the
*NL*
interference
of
the
supernatural
in
the
affairs
of
men
.
He
spoke
*NL*
lightly
,
but
it
was
evident
that
he
was
very
much
in
earnest
.
Stapleton
*NL*
was
guarded
in
his
replies
,
but
it
was
easy
to
see
that
he
said
less
*NL*
than
he
might
,
and
that
he
would
not
express
his
whole
opinion
out
of
*NL*
consideration
for
the
feelings
of
the
baronet
.
He
told
us
of
similar
*NL*
cases
,
where
families
had
suffered
from
some
evil
influence
,
and
he
left
*NL*
us
with
the
impression
that
he
shared
the
popular
view
upon
the
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
our
way
back
we
stayed
for
lunch
at
Merripit
House
,
and
it
was
there
*NL*
that
Sir
Henry
made
the
acquaintance
of
Miss
Stapleton
.
From
the
first
*NL*
moment
that
he
saw
her
he
appeared
to
be
strongly
attracted
by
her
,
and
*NL*
I
am
much
mistaken
if
the
feeling
was
not
mutual
.
He
referred
to
her
*NL*
again
and
again
on
our
walk
home
,
and
since
then
hardly
a
day
has
passed
*NL*
that
we
have
not
seen
something
of
the
brother
and
sister
.
They
dine
*NL*
here
tonight
,
and
there
is
some
talk
of
our
going
to
them
next
week
.
One
*NL*
would
imagine
that
such
a
match
would
be
very
welcome
to
Stapleton
,
and
*NL*
yet
I
have
more
than
once
caught
a
look
of
the
strongest
disapprobation
*NL*
in
his
face
when
Sir
Henry
has
been
paying
some
attention
to
his
sister
.
*NL*
He
is
much
attached
to
her
,
no
doubt
,
and
would
lead
a
lonely
life
*NL*
without
her
,
but
it
would
seem
the
height
of
selfishness
if
he
were
to
*NL*
stand
in
the
way
of
her
making
so
brilliant
a
marriage
.
Yet
I
am
certain
*NL*
that
he
does
not
wish
their
intimacy
to
ripen
into
love
,
and
I
have
*NL*
several
times
observed
that
he
has
taken
pains
to
prevent
them
from
*NL*
being
tete-a-tete
.
By
the
way
,
your
instructions
to
me
never
to
allow
*NL*
Sir
Henry
to
go
out
alone
will
become
very
much
more
onerous
if
a
love
*NL*
affair
were
to
be
added
to
our
other
difficulties
.
My
popularity
would
*NL*
soon
suffer
if
I
were
to
carry
out
your
orders
to
the
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
day
--
Thursday
,
to
be
more
exact
--
Dr.
Mortimer
lunched
with
us
.
*NL*
He
has
been
excavating
a
barrow
at
Long
Down
and
has
got
a
prehistoric
*NL*
skull
which
fills
him
with
great
joy
.
Never
was
there
such
a
*NL*
single-minded
enthusiast
as
he
!
The
Stapletons
came
in
afterwards
,
and
*NL*
the
good
doctor
took
us
all
to
the
yew
alley
at
Sir
Henry
's
request
to
*NL*
show
us
exactly
how
everything
occurred
upon
that
fatal
night
.
It
is
*NL*
a
long
,
dismal
walk
,
the
yew
alley
,
between
two
high
walls
of
clipped
*NL*
hedge
,
with
a
narrow
band
of
grass
upon
either
side
.
At
the
far
end
is
*NL*
an
old
tumble-down
summer-house
.
Halfway
down
is
the
moor-gate
,
where
*NL*
the
old
gentleman
left
his
cigar-ash
.
It
is
a
white
wooden
gate
with
*NL*
a
latch
.
Beyond
it
lies
the
wide
moor
.
I
remembered
your
theory
of
the
*NL*
affair
and
tried
to
picture
all
that
had
occurred
.
As
the
old
man
stood
*NL*
there
he
saw
something
coming
across
the
moor
,
something
which
terrified
*NL*
him
so
that
he
lost
his
wits
and
ran
and
ran
until
he
died
of
sheer
*NL*
horror
and
exhaustion
.
There
was
the
long
,
gloomy
tunnel
down
which
*NL*
he
fled
.
And
from
what
?
A
sheep-dog
of
the
moor
?
Or
a
spectral
hound
,
*NL*
black
,
silent
,
and
monstrous
?
Was
there
a
human
agency
in
the
matter
?
*NL*
Did
the
pale
,
watchful
Barrymore
know
more
than
he
cared
to
say
?
It
was
*NL*
all
dim
and
vague
,
but
always
there
is
the
dark
shadow
of
crime
behind
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
other
neighbour
I
have
met
since
I
wrote
last
.
This
is
Mr.
*NL*
Frankland
,
of
Lafter
Hall
,
who
lives
some
four
miles
to
the
south
of
us
.
*NL*
He
is
an
elderly
man
,
red-faced
,
white-haired
,
and
choleric
.
His
passion
*NL*
is
for
the
British
law
,
and
he
has
spent
a
large
fortune
in
litigation
.
*NL*
He
fights
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
fighting
and
is
equally
ready
to
take
*NL*
up
either
side
of
a
question
,
so
that
it
is
no
wonder
that
he
has
found
*NL*
it
a
costly
amusement
.
Sometimes
he
will
shut
up
a
right
of
way
and
defy
*NL*
the
parish
to
make
him
open
it
.
At
others
he
will
with
his
own
hands
*NL*
tear
down
some
other
man
's
gate
and
declare
that
a
path
has
existed
*NL*
there
from
time
immemorial
,
defying
the
owner
to
prosecute
him
for
*NL*
trespass
.
He
is
learned
in
old
manorial
and
communal
rights
,
and
he
*NL*
applies
his
knowledge
sometimes
in
favour
of
the
villagers
of
Fernworthy
*NL*
and
sometimes
against
them
,
so
that
he
is
periodically
either
carried
in
*NL*
triumph
down
the
village
street
or
else
burned
in
effigy
,
according
to
*NL*
his
latest
exploit
.
He
is
said
to
have
about
seven
lawsuits
upon
his
*NL*
hands
at
present
,
which
will
probably
swallow
up
the
remainder
of
his
*NL*
fortune
and
so
draw
his
sting
and
leave
him
harmless
for
the
future
.
*NL*
Apart
from
the
law
he
seems
a
kindly
,
good-natured
person
,
and
I
*NL*
only
mention
him
because
you
were
particular
that
I
should
send
some
*NL*
description
of
the
people
who
surround
us
.
He
is
curiously
employed
*NL*
at
present
,
for
,
being
an
amateur
astronomer
,
he
has
an
excellent
*NL*
telescope
,
with
which
he
lies
upon
the
roof
of
his
own
house
and
sweeps
*NL*
the
moor
all
day
in
the
hope
of
catching
a
glimpse
of
the
escaped
*NL*
convict
.
If
he
would
confine
his
energies
to
this
all
would
be
well
,
but
*NL*
there
are
rumours
that
he
intends
to
prosecute
Dr.
Mortimer
for
opening
*NL*
a
grave
without
the
consent
of
the
next
of
kin
because
he
dug
up
the
*NL*
Neolithic
skull
in
the
barrow
on
Long
Down
.
He
helps
to
keep
our
lives
*NL*
from
being
monotonous
and
gives
a
little
comic
relief
where
it
is
badly
*NL*
needed
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
,
having
brought
you
up
to
date
in
the
escaped
convict
,
the
*NL*
Stapletons
,
Dr.
Mortimer
,
and
Frankland
,
of
Lafter
Hall
,
let
me
end
on
*NL*
that
which
is
most
important
and
tell
you
more
about
the
Barrymores
,
and
*NL*
especially
about
the
surprising
development
of
last
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
First
of
all
about
the
test
telegram
,
which
you
sent
from
London
in
*NL*
order
to
make
sure
that
Barrymore
was
really
here
.
I
have
already
*NL*
explained
that
the
testimony
of
the
postmaster
shows
that
the
test
was
*NL*
worthless
and
that
we
have
no
proof
one
way
or
the
other
.
I
told
Sir
*NL*
Henry
how
the
matter
stood
,
and
he
at
once
,
in
his
downright
fashion
,
*NL*
had
Barrymore
up
and
asked
him
whether
he
had
received
the
telegram
*NL*
himself
.
Barrymore
said
that
he
had
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
the
boy
deliver
it
into
your
own
hands
?
''
asked
Sir
Henry
.
*NL*
*NL*
Barrymore
looked
surprised
,
and
considered
for
a
little
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
was
in
the
box-room
at
the
time
,
and
my
wife
brought
*NL*
it
up
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
answer
it
yourself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
told
my
wife
what
to
answer
and
she
went
down
to
write
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
he
recurred
to
the
subject
of
his
own
accord
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
not
quite
understand
the
object
of
your
questions
this
morning
,
*NL*
Sir
Henry
,
''
said
he
.
``
I
trust
that
they
do
not
mean
that
I
have
done
*NL*
anything
to
forfeit
your
confidence
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Henry
had
to
assure
him
that
it
was
not
so
and
pacify
him
by
giving
*NL*
him
a
considerable
part
of
his
old
wardrobe
,
the
London
outfit
having
*NL*
now
all
arrived
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Barrymore
is
of
interest
to
me
.
She
is
a
heavy
,
solid
person
,
very
*NL*
limited
,
intensely
respectable
,
and
inclined
to
be
puritanical
.
You
*NL*
could
hardly
conceive
a
less
emotional
subject
.
Yet
I
have
told
you
how
,
*NL*
on
the
first
night
here
,
I
heard
her
sobbing
bitterly
,
and
since
then
*NL*
I
have
more
than
once
observed
traces
of
tears
upon
her
face
.
Some
deep
*NL*
sorrow
gnaws
ever
at
her
heart
.
Sometimes
I
wonder
if
she
has
a
guilty
*NL*
memory
which
haunts
her
,
and
sometimes
I
suspect
Barrymore
of
being
a
*NL*
domestic
tyrant
.
I
have
always
felt
that
there
was
something
singular
*NL*
and
questionable
in
this
man
's
character
,
but
the
adventure
of
last
*NL*
night
brings
all
my
suspicions
to
a
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
it
may
seem
a
small
matter
in
itself
.
You
are
aware
that
I
am
*NL*
not
a
very
sound
sleeper
,
and
since
I
have
been
on
guard
in
this
house
*NL*
my
slumbers
have
been
lighter
than
ever
.
Last
night
,
about
two
in
the
*NL*
morning
,
I
was
aroused
by
a
stealthy
step
passing
my
room
.
I
rose
,
*NL*
opened
my
door
,
and
peeped
out
.
A
long
black
shadow
was
trailing
down
*NL*
the
corridor
.
It
was
thrown
by
a
man
who
walked
softly
down
the
passage
*NL*
with
a
candle
held
in
his
hand
.
He
was
in
shirt
and
trousers
,
with
no
*NL*
covering
to
his
feet
.
I
could
merely
see
the
outline
,
but
his
height
*NL*
told
me
that
it
was
Barrymore
.
He
walked
very
slowly
and
circumspectly
,
*NL*
and
there
was
something
indescribably
guilty
and
furtive
in
his
whole
*NL*
appearance
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
told
you
that
the
corridor
is
broken
by
the
balcony
which
runs
*NL*
round
the
hall
,
but
that
it
is
resumed
upon
the
farther
side
.
I
waited
*NL*
until
he
had
passed
out
of
sight
and
then
I
followed
him
.
When
I
came
*NL*
round
the
balcony
he
had
reached
the
end
of
the
farther
corridor
,
and
*NL*
I
could
see
from
the
glimmer
of
light
through
an
open
door
that
he
*NL*
had
entered
one
of
the
rooms
.
Now
,
all
these
rooms
are
unfurnished
and
*NL*
unoccupied
so
that
his
expedition
became
more
mysterious
than
ever
.
The
*NL*
light
shone
steadily
as
if
he
were
standing
motionless
.
I
crept
down
*NL*
the
passage
as
noiselessly
as
I
could
and
peeped
round
the
corner
of
the
*NL*
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Barrymore
was
crouching
at
the
window
with
the
candle
held
against
the
*NL*
glass
.
His
profile
was
half
turned
towards
me
,
and
his
face
seemed
to
be
*NL*
rigid
with
expectation
as
he
stared
out
into
the
blackness
of
the
moor
.
*NL*
For
some
minutes
he
stood
watching
intently
.
Then
he
gave
a
deep
groan
*NL*
and
with
an
impatient
gesture
he
put
out
the
light
.
Instantly
I
made
my
*NL*
way
back
to
my
room
,
and
very
shortly
came
the
stealthy
steps
passing
*NL*
once
more
upon
their
return
journey
.
Long
afterwards
when
I
had
fallen
*NL*
into
a
light
sleep
I
heard
a
key
turn
somewhere
in
a
lock
,
but
I
could
*NL*
not
tell
whence
the
sound
came
.
What
it
all
means
I
can
not
guess
,
but
*NL*
there
is
some
secret
business
going
on
in
this
house
of
gloom
which
*NL*
sooner
or
later
we
shall
get
to
the
bottom
of
.
I
do
not
trouble
you
with
*NL*
my
theories
,
for
you
asked
me
to
furnish
you
only
with
facts
.
I
have
*NL*
had
a
long
talk
with
Sir
Henry
this
morning
,
and
we
have
made
a
plan
of
*NL*
campaign
founded
upon
my
observations
of
last
night
.
I
will
not
speak
*NL*
about
it
just
now
,
but
it
should
make
my
next
report
interesting
*NL*
reading
.

The
Light
upon
the
Moor

Second
Report
of
Dr.
Watson
-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Baskerville
Hall
,
Oct.
15th
.
MY
DEAR
HOLMES
:
If
I
was
compelled
to
*NL*
leave
you
without
much
news
during
the
early
days
of
my
mission
you
must
*NL*
acknowledge
that
I
am
making
up
for
lost
time
,
and
that
events
are
now
*NL*
crowding
thick
and
fast
upon
us
.
In
my
last
report
I
ended
upon
my
top
*NL*
note
with
Barrymore
at
the
window
,
and
now
I
have
quite
a
budget
already
*NL*
which
will
,
unless
I
am
much
mistaken
,
considerably
surprise
you
.
Things
*NL*
have
taken
a
turn
which
I
could
not
have
anticipated
.
In
some
ways
they
*NL*
have
within
the
last
forty-eight
hours
become
much
clearer
and
in
some
*NL*
ways
they
have
become
more
complicated
.
But
I
will
tell
you
all
and
you
*NL*
shall
judge
for
yourself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
breakfast
on
the
morning
following
my
adventure
I
went
down
the
*NL*
corridor
and
examined
the
room
in
which
Barrymore
had
been
on
the
night
*NL*
before
.
The
western
window
through
which
he
had
stared
so
intently
has
,
*NL*
I
noticed
,
one
peculiarity
above
all
other
windows
in
the
house
--
it
*NL*
commands
the
nearest
outlook
on
to
the
moor
.
There
is
an
opening
between
*NL*
two
trees
which
enables
one
from
this
point
of
view
to
look
right
down
*NL*
upon
it
,
while
from
all
the
other
windows
it
is
only
a
distant
glimpse
*NL*
which
can
be
obtained
.
It
follows
,
therefore
,
that
Barrymore
,
since
*NL*
only
this
window
would
serve
the
purpose
,
must
have
been
looking
out
for
*NL*
something
or
somebody
upon
the
moor
.
The
night
was
very
dark
,
so
that
I
*NL*
can
hardly
imagine
how
he
could
have
hoped
to
see
anyone
.
It
had
struck
*NL*
me
that
it
was
possible
that
some
love
intrigue
was
on
foot
.
That
would
*NL*
have
accounted
for
his
stealthy
movements
and
also
for
the
uneasiness
*NL*
of
his
wife
.
The
man
is
a
striking-looking
fellow
,
very
well
equipped
*NL*
to
steal
the
heart
of
a
country
girl
,
so
that
this
theory
seemed
to
*NL*
have
something
to
support
it
.
That
opening
of
the
door
which
I
had
heard
*NL*
after
I
had
returned
to
my
room
might
mean
that
he
had
gone
out
to
keep
*NL*
some
clandestine
appointment
.
So
I
reasoned
with
myself
in
the
morning
,
*NL*
and
I
tell
you
the
direction
of
my
suspicions
,
however
much
the
result
*NL*
may
have
shown
that
they
were
unfounded
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
whatever
the
true
explanation
of
Barrymore
's
movements
might
be
,
*NL*
I
felt
that
the
responsibility
of
keeping
them
to
myself
until
I
could
*NL*
explain
them
was
more
than
I
could
bear
.
I
had
an
interview
with
the
*NL*
baronet
in
his
study
after
breakfast
,
and
I
told
him
all
that
I
had
*NL*
seen
.
He
was
less
surprised
than
I
had
expected
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
that
Barrymore
walked
about
nights
,
and
I
had
a
mind
to
speak
*NL*
to
him
about
it
,
''
said
he
.
``
Two
or
three
times
I
have
heard
his
steps
in
*NL*
the
passage
,
coming
and
going
,
just
about
the
hour
you
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
then
he
pays
a
visit
every
night
to
that
particular
window
,
''
I
*NL*
suggested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
he
does
.
If
so
,
we
should
be
able
to
shadow
him
and
see
what
*NL*
it
is
that
he
is
after
.
I
wonder
what
your
friend
Holmes
would
do
if
he
*NL*
were
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
that
he
would
do
exactly
what
you
now
suggest
,
''
said
I.
``
He
*NL*
would
follow
Barrymore
and
see
what
he
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
we
shall
do
it
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
surely
he
would
hear
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
man
is
rather
deaf
,
and
in
any
case
we
must
take
our
chance
of
*NL*
that
.
We
'll
sit
up
in
my
room
tonight
and
wait
until
he
passes
.
''
Sir
*NL*
Henry
rubbed
his
hands
with
pleasure
,
and
it
was
evident
that
he
hailed
*NL*
the
adventure
as
a
relief
to
his
somewhat
quiet
life
upon
the
moor
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
baronet
has
been
in
communication
with
the
architect
who
prepared
*NL*
the
plans
for
Sir
Charles
,
and
with
a
contractor
from
London
,
so
that
we
*NL*
may
expect
great
changes
to
begin
here
soon
.
There
have
been
decorators
*NL*
and
furnishers
up
from
Plymouth
,
and
it
is
evident
that
our
friend
*NL*
has
large
ideas
and
means
to
spare
no
pains
or
expense
to
restore
the
*NL*
grandeur
of
his
family
.
When
the
house
is
renovated
and
refurnished
,
all
*NL*
that
he
will
need
will
be
a
wife
to
make
it
complete
.
Between
ourselves
*NL*
there
are
pretty
clear
signs
that
this
will
not
be
wanting
if
the
lady
*NL*
is
willing
,
for
I
have
seldom
seen
a
man
more
infatuated
with
a
woman
*NL*
than
he
is
with
our
beautiful
neighbour
,
Miss
Stapleton
.
And
yet
the
*NL*
course
of
true
love
does
not
run
quite
as
smoothly
as
one
would
under
*NL*
the
circumstances
expect
.
Today
,
for
example
,
its
surface
was
broken
*NL*
by
a
very
unexpected
ripple
,
which
has
caused
our
friend
considerable
*NL*
perplexity
and
annoyance
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
conversation
which
I
have
quoted
about
Barrymore
,
Sir
Henry
*NL*
put
on
his
hat
and
prepared
to
go
out
.
As
a
matter
of
course
I
did
the
*NL*
same
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
are
you
coming
,
Watson
?
''
he
asked
,
looking
at
me
in
a
curious
*NL*
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
depends
on
whether
you
are
going
on
the
moor
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
know
what
my
instructions
are
.
I
am
sorry
to
intrude
,
but
*NL*
you
heard
how
earnestly
Holmes
insisted
that
I
should
not
leave
you
,
and
*NL*
especially
that
you
should
not
go
alone
upon
the
moor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Henry
put
his
hand
upon
my
shoulder
with
a
pleasant
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
fellow
,
''
said
he
,
``
Holmes
,
with
all
his
wisdom
,
did
not
foresee
*NL*
some
things
which
have
happened
since
I
have
been
on
the
moor
.
You
*NL*
understand
me
?
I
am
sure
that
you
are
the
last
man
in
the
world
who
*NL*
would
wish
to
be
a
spoil-sport
.
I
must
go
out
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
put
me
in
a
most
awkward
position
.
I
was
at
a
loss
what
to
say
or
*NL*
what
to
do
,
and
before
I
had
made
up
my
mind
he
picked
up
his
cane
and
*NL*
was
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
I
came
to
think
the
matter
over
my
conscience
reproached
me
*NL*
bitterly
for
having
on
any
pretext
allowed
him
to
go
out
of
my
sight
.
*NL*
I
imagined
what
my
feelings
would
be
if
I
had
to
return
to
you
and
to
*NL*
confess
that
some
misfortune
had
occurred
through
my
disregard
for
your
*NL*
instructions
.
I
assure
you
my
cheeks
flushed
at
the
very
thought
.
It
*NL*
might
not
even
now
be
too
late
to
overtake
him
,
so
I
set
off
at
once
in
*NL*
the
direction
of
Merripit
House
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
hurried
along
the
road
at
the
top
of
my
speed
without
seeing
anything
*NL*
of
Sir
Henry
,
until
I
came
to
the
point
where
the
moor
path
branches
*NL*
off
.
There
,
fearing
that
perhaps
I
had
come
in
the
wrong
direction
after
*NL*
all
,
I
mounted
a
hill
from
which
I
could
command
a
view
--
the
same
hill
*NL*
which
is
cut
into
the
dark
quarry
.
Thence
I
saw
him
at
once
.
He
was
on
*NL*
the
moor
path
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
off
,
and
a
lady
was
by
his
side
*NL*
who
could
only
be
Miss
Stapleton
.
It
was
clear
that
there
was
already
*NL*
an
understanding
between
them
and
that
they
had
met
by
appointment
.
They
*NL*
were
walking
slowly
along
in
deep
conversation
,
and
I
saw
her
making
*NL*
quick
little
movements
of
her
hands
as
if
she
were
very
earnest
in
what
*NL*
she
was
saying
,
while
he
listened
intently
,
and
once
or
twice
shook
his
*NL*
head
in
strong
dissent
.
I
stood
among
the
rocks
watching
them
,
very
much
*NL*
puzzled
as
to
what
I
should
do
next
.
To
follow
them
and
break
into
their
*NL*
intimate
conversation
seemed
to
be
an
outrage
,
and
yet
my
clear
duty
was
*NL*
never
for
an
instant
to
let
him
out
of
my
sight
.
To
act
the
spy
upon
a
*NL*
friend
was
a
hateful
task
.
Still
,
I
could
see
no
better
course
than
to
*NL*
observe
him
from
the
hill
,
and
to
clear
my
conscience
by
confessing
to
*NL*
him
afterwards
what
I
had
done
.
It
is
true
that
if
any
sudden
danger
had
*NL*
threatened
him
I
was
too
far
away
to
be
of
use
,
and
yet
I
am
sure
that
*NL*
you
will
agree
with
me
that
the
position
was
very
difficult
,
and
that
*NL*
there
was
nothing
more
which
I
could
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
friend
,
Sir
Henry
,
and
the
lady
had
halted
on
the
path
and
were
*NL*
standing
deeply
absorbed
in
their
conversation
,
when
I
was
suddenly
*NL*
aware
that
I
was
not
the
only
witness
of
their
interview
.
A
wisp
of
*NL*
green
floating
in
the
air
caught
my
eye
,
and
another
glance
showed
me
*NL*
that
it
was
carried
on
a
stick
by
a
man
who
was
moving
among
the
broken
*NL*
ground
.
It
was
Stapleton
with
his
butterfly-net
.
He
was
very
much
closer
*NL*
to
the
pair
than
I
was
,
and
he
appeared
to
be
moving
in
their
direction
.
*NL*
At
this
instant
Sir
Henry
suddenly
drew
Miss
Stapleton
to
his
side
.
His
*NL*
arm
was
round
her
,
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
she
was
straining
away
from
*NL*
him
with
her
face
averted
.
He
stooped
his
head
to
hers
,
and
she
raised
*NL*
one
hand
as
if
in
protest
.
Next
moment
I
saw
them
spring
apart
and
turn
*NL*
hurriedly
round
.
Stapleton
was
the
cause
of
the
interruption
.
He
was
*NL*
running
wildly
towards
them
,
his
absurd
net
dangling
behind
him
.
He
*NL*
gesticulated
and
almost
danced
with
excitement
in
front
of
the
lovers
.
*NL*
What
the
scene
meant
I
could
not
imagine
,
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
*NL*
Stapleton
was
abusing
Sir
Henry
,
who
offered
explanations
,
which
became
*NL*
more
angry
as
the
other
refused
to
accept
them
.
The
lady
stood
by
in
*NL*
haughty
silence
.
Finally
Stapleton
turned
upon
his
heel
and
beckoned
in
*NL*
a
peremptory
way
to
his
sister
,
who
,
after
an
irresolute
glance
at
Sir
*NL*
Henry
,
walked
off
by
the
side
of
her
brother
.
The
naturalist
's
angry
*NL*
gestures
showed
that
the
lady
was
included
in
his
displeasure
.
The
*NL*
baronet
stood
for
a
minute
looking
after
them
,
and
then
he
walked
slowly
*NL*
back
the
way
that
he
had
come
,
his
head
hanging
,
the
very
picture
of
*NL*
dejection
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
all
this
meant
I
could
not
imagine
,
but
I
was
deeply
ashamed
to
*NL*
have
witnessed
so
intimate
a
scene
without
my
friend
's
knowledge
.
I
ran
*NL*
down
the
hill
therefore
and
met
the
baronet
at
the
bottom
.
His
face
was
*NL*
flushed
with
anger
and
his
brows
were
wrinkled
,
like
one
who
is
at
his
*NL*
wit
's
ends
what
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Halloa
,
Watson
!
Where
have
you
dropped
from
?
''
said
he
.
``
You
do
n't
mean
*NL*
to
say
that
you
came
after
me
in
spite
of
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
explained
everything
to
him
:
how
I
had
found
it
impossible
to
remain
*NL*
behind
,
how
I
had
followed
him
,
and
how
I
had
witnessed
all
that
*NL*
had
occurred
.
For
an
instant
his
eyes
blazed
at
me
,
but
my
frankness
*NL*
disarmed
his
anger
,
and
he
broke
at
last
into
a
rather
rueful
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
have
thought
the
middle
of
that
prairie
a
fairly
safe
*NL*
place
for
a
man
to
be
private
,
''
said
he
,
``
but
,
by
thunder
,
the
whole
*NL*
countryside
seems
to
have
been
out
to
see
me
do
my
wooing
--
and
a
mighty
*NL*
poor
wooing
at
that
!
Where
had
you
engaged
a
seat
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
on
that
hill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
in
the
back
row
,
eh
?
But
her
brother
was
well
up
to
the
front
.
*NL*
Did
you
see
him
come
out
on
us
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
he
ever
strike
you
as
being
crazy
--
this
brother
of
hers
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
say
that
he
ever
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dare
say
not
.
I
always
thought
him
sane
enough
until
today
,
but
you
*NL*
can
take
it
from
me
that
either
he
or
I
ought
to
be
in
a
straitjacket
.
*NL*
What
's
the
matter
with
me
,
anyhow
?
You
've
lived
near
me
for
some
weeks
,
*NL*
Watson
.
Tell
me
straight
,
now
!
Is
there
anything
that
would
prevent
me
*NL*
from
making
a
good
husband
to
a
woman
that
I
loved
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
say
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
ca
n't
object
to
my
worldly
position
,
so
it
must
be
myself
that
he
*NL*
has
this
down
on
.
What
has
he
against
me
?
I
never
hurt
man
or
woman
in
*NL*
my
life
that
I
know
of
.
And
yet
he
would
not
so
much
as
let
me
touch
the
*NL*
tips
of
her
fingers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
he
say
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
,
and
a
deal
more
.
I
tell
you
,
Watson
,
I
've
only
known
her
these
*NL*
few
weeks
,
but
from
the
first
I
just
felt
that
she
was
made
for
me
,
*NL*
and
she
,
too
--
she
was
happy
when
she
was
with
me
,
and
that
I
'll
swear
.
*NL*
There
's
a
light
in
a
woman
's
eyes
that
speaks
louder
than
words
.
But
he
*NL*
has
never
let
us
get
together
and
it
was
only
today
for
the
first
time
*NL*
that
I
saw
a
chance
of
having
a
few
words
with
her
alone
.
She
was
glad
*NL*
to
meet
me
,
but
when
she
did
it
was
not
love
that
she
would
talk
about
,
*NL*
and
she
would
n't
have
let
me
talk
about
it
either
if
she
could
have
*NL*
stopped
it
.
She
kept
coming
back
to
it
that
this
was
a
place
of
danger
,
*NL*
and
that
she
would
never
be
happy
until
I
had
left
it
.
I
told
her
that
*NL*
since
I
had
seen
her
I
was
in
no
hurry
to
leave
it
,
and
that
if
she
*NL*
really
wanted
me
to
go
,
the
only
way
to
work
it
was
for
her
to
arrange
*NL*
to
go
with
me
.
With
that
I
offered
in
as
many
words
to
marry
her
,
but
*NL*
before
she
could
answer
,
down
came
this
brother
of
hers
,
running
at
us
*NL*
with
a
face
on
him
like
a
madman
.
He
was
just
white
with
rage
,
and
those
*NL*
light
eyes
of
his
were
blazing
with
fury
.
What
was
I
doing
with
the
*NL*
lady
?
How
dared
I
offer
her
attentions
which
were
distasteful
to
her
?
*NL*
Did
I
think
that
because
I
was
a
baronet
I
could
do
what
I
liked
?
If
he
*NL*
had
not
been
her
brother
I
should
have
known
better
how
to
answer
him
.
*NL*
As
it
was
I
told
him
that
my
feelings
towards
his
sister
were
such
as
*NL*
I
was
not
ashamed
of
,
and
that
I
hoped
that
she
might
honour
me
by
*NL*
becoming
my
wife
.
That
seemed
to
make
the
matter
no
better
,
so
then
I
*NL*
lost
my
temper
too
,
and
I
answered
him
rather
more
hotly
than
I
should
*NL*
perhaps
,
considering
that
she
was
standing
by
.
So
it
ended
by
his
going
*NL*
off
with
her
,
as
you
saw
,
and
here
am
I
as
badly
puzzled
a
man
as
any
*NL*
in
this
county
.
Just
tell
me
what
it
all
means
,
Watson
,
and
I
'll
owe
you
*NL*
more
than
ever
I
can
hope
to
pay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
tried
one
or
two
explanations
,
but
,
indeed
,
I
was
completely
puzzled
*NL*
myself
.
Our
friend
's
title
,
his
fortune
,
his
age
,
his
character
,
and
his
*NL*
appearance
are
all
in
his
favour
,
and
I
know
nothing
against
him
unless
*NL*
it
be
this
dark
fate
which
runs
in
his
family
.
That
his
advances
should
*NL*
be
rejected
so
brusquely
without
any
reference
to
the
lady
's
own
wishes
*NL*
and
that
the
lady
should
accept
the
situation
without
protest
is
very
*NL*
amazing
.
However
,
our
conjectures
were
set
at
rest
by
a
visit
from
*NL*
Stapleton
himself
that
very
afternoon
.
He
had
come
to
offer
apologies
*NL*
for
his
rudeness
of
the
morning
,
and
after
a
long
private
interview
with
*NL*
Sir
Henry
in
his
study
the
upshot
of
their
conversation
was
that
the
*NL*
breach
is
quite
healed
,
and
that
we
are
to
dine
at
Merripit
House
next
*NL*
Friday
as
a
sign
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
say
now
that
he
is
n't
a
crazy
man
,
''
said
Sir
Henry
;
``
I
ca
n't
*NL*
forget
the
look
in
his
eyes
when
he
ran
at
me
this
morning
,
but
I
must
*NL*
allow
that
no
man
could
make
a
more
handsome
apology
than
he
has
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
he
give
any
explanation
of
his
conduct
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
sister
is
everything
in
his
life
,
he
says
.
That
is
natural
enough
,
*NL*
and
I
am
glad
that
he
should
understand
her
value
.
They
have
always
been
*NL*
together
,
and
according
to
his
account
he
has
been
a
very
lonely
man
*NL*
with
only
her
as
a
companion
,
so
that
the
thought
of
losing
her
was
*NL*
really
terrible
to
him
.
He
had
not
understood
,
he
said
,
that
I
was
*NL*
becoming
attached
to
her
,
but
when
he
saw
with
his
own
eyes
that
it
was
*NL*
really
so
,
and
that
she
might
be
taken
away
from
him
,
it
gave
him
such
a
*NL*
shock
that
for
a
time
he
was
not
responsible
for
what
he
said
or
did
.
*NL*
He
was
very
sorry
for
all
that
had
passed
,
and
he
recognized
how
foolish
*NL*
and
how
selfish
it
was
that
he
should
imagine
that
he
could
hold
a
*NL*
beautiful
woman
like
his
sister
to
himself
for
her
whole
life
.
If
she
*NL*
had
to
leave
him
he
had
rather
it
was
to
a
neighbour
like
myself
than
to
*NL*
anyone
else
.
But
in
any
case
it
was
a
blow
to
him
and
it
would
take
him
*NL*
some
time
before
he
could
prepare
himself
to
meet
it
.
He
would
withdraw
*NL*
all
opposition
upon
his
part
if
I
would
promise
for
three
months
to
let
*NL*
the
matter
rest
and
to
be
content
with
cultivating
the
lady
's
friendship
*NL*
during
that
time
without
claiming
her
love
.
This
I
promised
,
and
so
the
*NL*
matter
rests
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
there
is
one
of
our
small
mysteries
cleared
up
.
It
is
something
to
*NL*
have
touched
bottom
anywhere
in
this
bog
in
which
we
are
floundering
.
*NL*
We
know
now
why
Stapleton
looked
with
disfavour
upon
his
sister
's
*NL*
suitor
--
even
when
that
suitor
was
so
eligible
a
one
as
Sir
Henry
.
And
*NL*
now
I
pass
on
to
another
thread
which
I
have
extricated
out
of
the
*NL*
tangled
skein
,
the
mystery
of
the
sobs
in
the
night
,
of
the
tear-stained
*NL*
face
of
Mrs.
Barrymore
,
of
the
secret
journey
of
the
butler
to
the
*NL*
western
lattice
window
.
Congratulate
me
,
my
dear
Holmes
,
and
tell
me
*NL*
that
I
have
not
disappointed
you
as
an
agent
--
that
you
do
not
regret
*NL*
the
confidence
which
you
showed
in
me
when
you
sent
me
down
.
All
these
*NL*
things
have
by
one
night
's
work
been
thoroughly
cleared
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
said
``
by
one
night
's
work
,
''
but
,
in
truth
,
it
was
by
two
nights
'
*NL*
work
,
for
on
the
first
we
drew
entirely
blank
.
I
sat
up
with
Sir
Henry
*NL*
in
his
rooms
until
nearly
three
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
but
no
sound
of
*NL*
any
sort
did
we
hear
except
the
chiming
clock
upon
the
stairs
.
It
was
*NL*
a
most
melancholy
vigil
and
ended
by
each
of
us
falling
asleep
in
our
*NL*
chairs
.
Fortunately
we
were
not
discouraged
,
and
we
determined
to
try
*NL*
again
.
The
next
night
we
lowered
the
lamp
and
sat
smoking
cigarettes
*NL*
without
making
the
least
sound
.
It
was
incredible
how
slowly
the
hours
*NL*
crawled
by
,
and
yet
we
were
helped
through
it
by
the
same
sort
of
*NL*
patient
interest
which
the
hunter
must
feel
as
he
watches
the
trap
into
*NL*
which
he
hopes
the
game
may
wander
.
One
struck
,
and
two
,
and
we
had
*NL*
almost
for
the
second
time
given
it
up
in
despair
when
in
an
instant
we
*NL*
both
sat
bolt
upright
in
our
chairs
with
all
our
weary
senses
keenly
on
*NL*
the
alert
once
more
.
We
had
heard
the
creak
of
a
step
in
the
passage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Very
stealthily
we
heard
it
pass
along
until
it
died
away
in
the
*NL*
distance
.
Then
the
baronet
gently
opened
his
door
and
we
set
out
in
*NL*
pursuit
.
Already
our
man
had
gone
round
the
gallery
and
the
corridor
was
*NL*
all
in
darkness
.
Softly
we
stole
along
until
we
had
come
into
the
other
*NL*
wing
.
We
were
just
in
time
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
tall
,
black-bearded
*NL*
figure
,
his
shoulders
rounded
as
he
tiptoed
down
the
passage
.
Then
he
*NL*
passed
through
the
same
door
as
before
,
and
the
light
of
the
candle
*NL*
framed
it
in
the
darkness
and
shot
one
single
yellow
beam
across
the
*NL*
gloom
of
the
corridor
.
We
shuffled
cautiously
towards
it
,
trying
every
*NL*
plank
before
we
dared
to
put
our
whole
weight
upon
it
.
We
had
taken
the
*NL*
precaution
of
leaving
our
boots
behind
us
,
but
,
even
so
,
the
old
boards
*NL*
snapped
and
creaked
beneath
our
tread
.
Sometimes
it
seemed
impossible
*NL*
that
he
should
fail
to
hear
our
approach
.
However
,
the
man
is
*NL*
fortunately
rather
deaf
,
and
he
was
entirely
preoccupied
in
that
which
*NL*
he
was
doing
.
When
at
last
we
reached
the
door
and
peeped
through
we
*NL*
found
him
crouching
at
the
window
,
candle
in
hand
,
his
white
,
intent
*NL*
face
pressed
against
the
pane
,
exactly
as
I
had
seen
him
two
nights
*NL*
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
arranged
no
plan
of
campaign
,
but
the
baronet
is
a
man
to
whom
*NL*
the
most
direct
way
is
always
the
most
natural
.
He
walked
into
the
room
,
*NL*
and
as
he
did
so
Barrymore
sprang
up
from
the
window
with
a
sharp
hiss
*NL*
of
his
breath
and
stood
,
livid
and
trembling
,
before
us
.
His
dark
eyes
,
*NL*
glaring
out
of
the
white
mask
of
his
face
,
were
full
of
horror
and
*NL*
astonishment
as
he
gazed
from
Sir
Henry
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
doing
here
,
Barrymore
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
sir
.
''
His
agitation
was
so
great
that
he
could
hardly
speak
,
*NL*
and
the
shadows
sprang
up
and
down
from
the
shaking
of
his
candle
.
``
It
*NL*
was
the
window
,
sir
.
I
go
round
at
night
to
see
that
they
are
fastened
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
second
floor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
all
the
windows
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
,
Barrymore
,
''
said
Sir
Henry
sternly
,
``
we
have
made
up
our
*NL*
minds
to
have
the
truth
out
of
you
,
so
it
will
save
you
trouble
to
tell
*NL*
it
sooner
rather
than
later
.
Come
,
now
!
No
lies
!
What
were
you
doing
at
*NL*
that
window
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
fellow
looked
at
us
in
a
helpless
way
,
and
he
wrung
his
hands
*NL*
together
like
one
who
is
in
the
last
extremity
of
doubt
and
misery
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
doing
no
harm
,
sir
.
I
was
holding
a
candle
to
the
window
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
were
you
holding
a
candle
to
the
window
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
ask
me
,
Sir
Henry
--
do
n't
ask
me
!
I
give
you
my
word
,
sir
,
that
it
*NL*
is
not
my
secret
,
and
that
I
can
not
tell
it
.
If
it
concerned
no
one
but
*NL*
myself
I
would
not
try
to
keep
it
from
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
sudden
idea
occurred
to
me
,
and
I
took
the
candle
from
the
trembling
*NL*
hand
of
the
butler
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
must
have
been
holding
it
as
a
signal
,
''
said
I.
``
Let
us
see
if
*NL*
there
is
any
answer
.
''
I
held
it
as
he
had
done
,
and
stared
out
into
the
*NL*
darkness
of
the
night
.
Vaguely
I
could
discern
the
black
bank
of
the
*NL*
trees
and
the
lighter
expanse
of
the
moor
,
for
the
moon
was
behind
the
*NL*
clouds
.
And
then
I
gave
a
cry
of
exultation
,
for
a
tiny
pinpoint
of
*NL*
yellow
light
had
suddenly
transfixed
the
dark
veil
,
and
glowed
steadily
*NL*
in
the
centre
of
the
black
square
framed
by
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
it
is
!
''
I
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
sir
,
it
is
nothing
--
nothing
at
all
!
''
the
butler
broke
in
;
``
I
*NL*
assure
you
,
sir
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Move
your
light
across
the
window
,
Watson
!
''
cried
the
baronet
.
``
See
,
*NL*
the
other
moves
also
!
Now
,
you
rascal
,
do
you
deny
that
it
is
a
signal
?
*NL*
Come
,
speak
up
!
Who
is
your
confederate
out
yonder
,
and
what
is
this
*NL*
conspiracy
that
is
going
on
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
's
face
became
openly
defiant
.
``
It
is
my
business
,
and
not
yours
.
*NL*
I
will
not
tell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
leave
my
employment
right
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
,
sir
.
If
I
must
I
must
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
go
in
disgrace
.
By
thunder
,
you
may
well
be
ashamed
of
*NL*
yourself
.
Your
family
has
lived
with
mine
for
over
a
hundred
years
under
*NL*
this
roof
,
and
here
I
find
you
deep
in
some
dark
plot
against
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
sir
;
no
,
not
against
you
!
''
It
was
a
woman
's
voice
,
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Barrymore
,
paler
and
more
horror-struck
than
her
husband
,
was
standing
*NL*
at
the
door
.
Her
bulky
figure
in
a
shawl
and
skirt
might
have
been
comic
*NL*
were
it
not
for
the
intensity
of
feeling
upon
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
to
go
,
Eliza
.
This
is
the
end
of
it
.
You
can
pack
our
things
,
''
*NL*
said
the
butler
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
John
,
John
,
have
I
brought
you
to
this
?
It
is
my
doing
,
Sir
*NL*
Henry
--
all
mine
.
He
has
done
nothing
except
for
my
sake
and
because
I
*NL*
asked
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak
out
,
then
!
What
does
it
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
unhappy
brother
is
starving
on
the
moor
.
We
can
not
let
him
perish
at
*NL*
our
very
gates
.
The
light
is
a
signal
to
him
that
food
is
ready
for
him
,
*NL*
and
his
light
out
yonder
is
to
show
the
spot
to
which
to
bring
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
your
brother
is
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
escaped
convict
,
sir
--
Selden
,
the
criminal

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
truth
,
sir
,
''
said
Barrymore
.
``
I
said
that
it
was
not
my
*NL*
secret
and
that
I
could
not
tell
it
to
you
.
But
now
you
have
heard
it
,
*NL*
and
you
will
see
that
if
there
was
a
plot
it
was
not
against
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
,
then
,
was
the
explanation
of
the
stealthy
expeditions
at
night
*NL*
and
the
light
at
the
window
.
Sir
Henry
and
I
both
stared
at
the
woman
in
*NL*
amazement
.
Was
it
possible
that
this
stolidly
respectable
person
was
of
*NL*
the
same
blood
as
one
of
the
most
notorious
criminals
in
the
country
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
my
name
was
Selden
,
and
he
is
my
younger
brother
.
We
humoured
*NL*
him
too
much
when
he
was
a
lad
and
gave
him
his
own
way
in
everything
*NL*
until
he
came
to
think
that
the
world
was
made
for
his
pleasure
,
and
*NL*
that
he
could
do
what
he
liked
in
it
.
Then
as
he
grew
older
he
met
*NL*
wicked
companions
,
and
the
devil
entered
into
him
until
he
broke
my
*NL*
mother
's
heart
and
dragged
our
name
in
the
dirt
.
From
crime
to
crime
*NL*
he
sank
lower
and
lower
until
it
is
only
the
mercy
of
God
which
has
*NL*
snatched
him
from
the
scaffold
;
but
to
me
,
sir
,
he
was
always
the
little
*NL*
curly-headed
boy
that
I
had
nursed
and
played
with
as
an
elder
sister
*NL*
would
.
That
was
why
he
broke
prison
,
sir
.
He
knew
that
I
was
here
and
*NL*
that
we
could
not
refuse
to
help
him
.
When
he
dragged
himself
here
one
*NL*
night
,
weary
and
starving
,
with
the
warders
hard
at
his
heels
,
what
*NL*
could
we
do
?
We
took
him
in
and
fed
him
and
cared
for
him
.
Then
you
*NL*
returned
,
sir
,
and
my
brother
thought
he
would
be
safer
on
the
moor
than
*NL*
anywhere
else
until
the
hue
and
cry
was
over
,
so
he
lay
in
hiding
there
.
*NL*
But
every
second
night
we
made
sure
if
he
was
still
there
by
putting
a
*NL*
light
in
the
window
,
and
if
there
was
an
answer
my
husband
took
out
some
*NL*
bread
and
meat
to
him
.
Every
day
we
hoped
that
he
was
gone
,
but
as
long
*NL*
as
he
was
there
we
could
not
desert
him
.
That
is
the
whole
truth
,
as
I
*NL*
am
an
honest
Christian
woman
and
you
will
see
that
if
there
is
blame
in
*NL*
the
matter
it
does
not
lie
with
my
husband
but
with
me
,
for
whose
sake
*NL*
he
has
done
all
that
he
has
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
's
words
came
with
an
intense
earnestness
which
carried
*NL*
conviction
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
this
true
,
Barrymore
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Sir
Henry
.
Every
word
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
can
not
blame
you
for
standing
by
your
own
wife
.
Forget
what
*NL*
I
have
said
.
Go
to
your
room
,
you
two
,
and
we
shall
talk
further
about
*NL*
this
matter
in
the
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
were
gone
we
looked
out
of
the
window
again
.
Sir
Henry
had
*NL*
flung
it
open
,
and
the
cold
night
wind
beat
in
upon
our
faces
.
Far
away
*NL*
in
the
black
distance
there
still
glowed
that
one
tiny
point
of
yellow
*NL*
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
he
dares
,
''
said
Sir
Henry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
may
be
so
placed
as
to
be
only
visible
from
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
likely
.
How
far
do
you
think
it
is
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Out
by
the
Cleft
Tor
,
I
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
more
than
a
mile
or
two
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hardly
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
can
not
be
far
if
Barrymore
had
to
carry
out
the
food
to
it
.
*NL*
And
he
is
waiting
,
this
villain
,
beside
that
candle
.
By
thunder
,
Watson
,
*NL*
I
am
going
out
to
take
that
man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
same
thought
had
crossed
my
own
mind
.
It
was
not
as
if
the
*NL*
Barrymores
had
taken
us
into
their
confidence
.
Their
secret
had
been
*NL*
forced
from
them
.
The
man
was
a
danger
to
the
community
,
an
unmitigated
*NL*
scoundrel
for
whom
there
was
neither
pity
nor
excuse
.
We
were
only
doing
*NL*
our
duty
in
taking
this
chance
of
putting
him
back
where
he
could
do
no
*NL*
harm
.
With
his
brutal
and
violent
nature
,
others
would
have
to
pay
the
*NL*
price
if
we
held
our
hands
.
Any
night
,
for
example
,
our
neighbours
the
*NL*
Stapletons
might
be
attacked
by
him
,
and
it
may
have
been
the
thought
of
*NL*
this
which
made
Sir
Henry
so
keen
upon
the
adventure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
come
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
get
your
revolver
and
put
on
your
boots
.
The
sooner
we
start
the
*NL*
better
,
as
the
fellow
may
put
out
his
light
and
be
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
five
minutes
we
were
outside
the
door
,
starting
upon
our
expedition
.
*NL*
We
hurried
through
the
dark
shrubbery
,
amid
the
dull
moaning
of
the
*NL*
autumn
wind
and
the
rustle
of
the
falling
leaves
.
The
night
air
was
*NL*
heavy
with
the
smell
of
damp
and
decay
.
Now
and
again
the
moon
peeped
*NL*
out
for
an
instant
,
but
clouds
were
driving
over
the
face
of
the
sky
,
*NL*
and
just
as
we
came
out
on
the
moor
a
thin
rain
began
to
fall
.
The
light
*NL*
still
burned
steadily
in
front
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
armed
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
a
hunting-crop
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
close
in
on
him
rapidly
,
for
he
is
said
to
be
a
desperate
*NL*
fellow
.
We
shall
take
him
by
surprise
and
have
him
at
our
mercy
before
*NL*
he
can
resist
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
Watson
,
''
said
the
baronet
,
``
what
would
Holmes
say
to
this
?
How
*NL*
about
that
hour
of
darkness
in
which
the
power
of
evil
is
exalted
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
if
in
answer
to
his
words
there
rose
suddenly
out
of
the
vast
gloom
*NL*
of
the
moor
that
strange
cry
which
I
had
already
heard
upon
the
borders
*NL*
of
the
great
Grimpen
Mire
.
It
came
with
the
wind
through
the
silence
*NL*
of
the
night
,
a
long
,
deep
mutter
,
then
a
rising
howl
,
and
then
the
sad
*NL*
moan
in
which
it
died
away
.
Again
and
again
it
sounded
,
the
whole
air
*NL*
throbbing
with
it
,
strident
,
wild
,
and
menacing
.
The
baronet
caught
my
*NL*
sleeve
and
his
face
glimmered
white
through
the
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
God
,
what
's
that
,
Watson
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know

It
's

sound
they
have
on
the
moor

I
heard
it
once
*NL*
before

''
*NL*
*NL*
It
died
away
,
and
an
absolute
silence
closed
in
upon
us
.
We
stood
*NL*
straining
our
ears
,
but
nothing
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Watson
,
''
said
the
baronet
,
``
it
was
the
cry
of
a
hound

''
*NL*
*NL*
My
blood
ran
cold
in
my
veins
,
for
there
was
a
break
in
his
voice
which
*NL*
told
of
the
sudden
horror
which
had
seized
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
they
call
this
sound
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
folk
on
the
countryside

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

they
are
ignorant
people

you
mind

they
call
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
,
Watson
.
What
do
they
say
of
it

*NL*
*NL*
I
hesitated
but
could
not
escape
the
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
say
it
is
the
cry

the
Hound
of
the
Baskervilles

*NL*
*NL*
He
groaned
and
was
silent
for
a
few
moments
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
hound
it
was
,
''
he
said
at
last
,
``

it
seemed
to
come
from
miles
*NL*
away

over
yonder

I
think

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
hard
to
say
whence
it
came

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
rose
and
fell

*NL*

Yes

it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
was
up
there
.
Come
now
,
Watson
,
did
n't
you
think
yourself
that
*NL*
it
was
the
cry
of
a
hound
?
I
am
not
a
child
.
You
need
not
fear
to
speak
*NL*
the
truth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stapleton
was
with
me
when
I
heard
it
last
.
He
said
that
it
might
be
*NL*
the
calling
of
a
strange
bird
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
it
was
a
hound
.
My
God
,
can
there
be
some
truth
in
all
these
*NL*
stories
?
Is
it
possible
that
I
am
really
in
danger
from
so
dark
a
cause
?
*NL*
You
do
n't
believe
it
,
do
you
,
Watson
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
it
was
one
thing
to
laugh
about
it
in
London
,
and
it
is
another
*NL*
to
stand
out
here
in
the
darkness
of
the
moor
and
to
hear
such
a
cry
as
*NL*
that
.
And
my
uncle
!
There
was
the
footprint
of
the
hound
beside
him
as
*NL*
he
lay
.
It
all
fits
together
.
I
do
n't
think
that
I
am
a
coward
,
Watson
,
*NL*
but
that
sound
seemed
to
freeze
my
very
blood
.
Feel
my
hand
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
as
cold
as
a
block
of
marble
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
be
all
right
tomorrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
I
'll
get
that
cry
out
of
my
head
.
What
do
you
advise
that
*NL*
we
do
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
we
turn
back
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
by
thunder
;
we
have
come
out
to
get
our
man
,
and
we
will
do
it
.
We
*NL*
after
the
convict
,
and
a
hell-hound
,
as
likely
as
not
,
after
us
.
Come
*NL*
on
!
We
'll
see
it
through
if
all
the
fiends
of
the
pit
were
loose
upon
*NL*
the
moor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
stumbled
slowly
along
in
the
darkness
,
with
the
black
loom
of
the
*NL*
craggy
hills
around
us
,
and
the
yellow
speck
of
light
burning
steadily
*NL*
in
front
.
There
is
nothing
so
deceptive
as
the
distance
of
a
light
upon
*NL*
a
pitch-dark
night
,
and
sometimes
the
glimmer
seemed
to
be
far
away
upon
*NL*
the
horizon
and
sometimes
it
might
have
been
within
a
few
yards
of
us
.
*NL*
But
at
last
we
could
see
whence
it
came
,
and
then
we
knew
that
we
were
*NL*
indeed
very
close
.
A
guttering
candle
was
stuck
in
a
crevice
of
the
*NL*
rocks
which
flanked
it
on
each
side
so
as
to
keep
the
wind
from
it
*NL*
and
also
to
prevent
it
from
being
visible
,
save
in
the
direction
of
*NL*
Baskerville
Hall
.
A
boulder
of
granite
concealed
our
approach
,
and
*NL*
crouching
behind
it
we
gazed
over
it
at
the
signal
light
.
It
was
strange
*NL*
to
see
this
single
candle
burning
there
in
the
middle
of
the
moor
,
with
*NL*
no
sign
of
life
near
it
--
just
the
one
straight
yellow
flame
and
the
*NL*
gleam
of
the
rock
on
each
side
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
shall
we
do
now
?
''
whispered
Sir
Henry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
here
.
He
must
be
near
his
light
.
Let
us
see
if
we
can
get
a
*NL*
glimpse
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
words
were
hardly
out
of
my
mouth
when
we
both
saw
him
.
Over
the
*NL*
rocks
,
in
the
crevice
of
which
the
candle
burned
,
there
was
thrust
out
*NL*
an
evil
yellow
face
,
a
terrible
animal
face
,
all
seamed
and
scored
with
*NL*
vile
passions
.
Foul
with
mire
,
with
a
bristling
beard
,
and
hung
with
*NL*
matted
hair
,
it
might
well
have
belonged
to
one
of
those
old
savages
*NL*
who
dwelt
in
the
burrows
on
the
hillsides
.
The
light
beneath
him
was
*NL*
reflected
in
his
small
,
cunning
eyes
which
peered
fiercely
to
right
and
*NL*
left
through
the
darkness
like
a
crafty
and
savage
animal
who
has
heard
*NL*
the
steps
of
the
hunters
.
*NL*
*NL*
Something
had
evidently
aroused
his
suspicions
.
It
may
have
been
that
*NL*
Barrymore
had
some
private
signal
which
we
had
neglected
to
give
,
or
*NL*
the
fellow
may
have
had
some
other
reason
for
thinking
that
all
was
not
*NL*
well
,
but
I
could
read
his
fears
upon
his
wicked
face
.
Any
instant
he
*NL*
might
dash
out
the
light
and
vanish
in
the
darkness
.
I
sprang
forward
*NL*
therefore
,
and
Sir
Henry
did
the
same
.
At
the
same
moment
the
convict
*NL*
screamed
out
a
curse
at
us
and
hurled
a
rock
which
splintered
up
against
*NL*
the
boulder
which
had
sheltered
us
.
I
caught
one
glimpse
of
his
short
,
*NL*
squat
,
strongly
built
figure
as
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
turned
to
run
.
*NL*
At
the
same
moment
by
a
lucky
chance
the
moon
broke
through
the
clouds
.
*NL*
We
rushed
over
the
brow
of
the
hill
,
and
there
was
our
man
running
with
*NL*
great
speed
down
the
other
side
,
springing
over
the
stones
in
his
way
*NL*
with
the
activity
of
a
mountain
goat
.
A
lucky
long
shot
of
my
revolver
*NL*
might
have
crippled
him
,
but
I
had
brought
it
only
to
defend
myself
if
*NL*
attacked
and
not
to
shoot
an
unarmed
man
who
was
running
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
both
swift
runners
and
in
fairly
good
training
,
but
we
soon
*NL*
found
that
we
had
no
chance
of
overtaking
him
.
We
saw
him
for
a
long
*NL*
time
in
the
moonlight
until
he
was
only
a
small
speck
moving
swiftly
*NL*
among
the
boulders
upon
the
side
of
a
distant
hill
.
We
ran
and
ran
until
*NL*
we
were
completely
blown
,
but
the
space
between
us
grew
ever
wider
.
*NL*
Finally
we
stopped
and
sat
panting
on
two
rocks
,
while
we
watched
him
*NL*
disappearing
in
the
distance
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
it
was
at
this
moment
that
there
occurred
a
most
strange
and
*NL*
unexpected
thing
.
We
had
risen
from
our
rocks
and
were
turning
to
go
*NL*
home
,
having
abandoned
the
hopeless
chase
.
The
moon
was
low
upon
the
*NL*
right
,
and
the
jagged
pinnacle
of
a
granite
tor
stood
up
against
the
*NL*
lower
curve
of
its
silver
disc
.
There
,
outlined
as
black
as
an
ebony
*NL*
statue
on
that
shining
background
,
I
saw
the
figure
of
a
man
upon
the
*NL*
tor
.
Do
not
think
that
it
was
a
delusion
,
Holmes
.
I
assure
you
that
*NL*
I
have
never
in
my
life
seen
anything
more
clearly
.
As
far
as
I
could
*NL*
judge
,
the
figure
was
that
of
a
tall
,
thin
man
.
He
stood
with
his
legs
*NL*
a
little
separated
,
his
arms
folded
,
his
head
bowed
,
as
if
he
were
*NL*
brooding
over
that
enormous
wilderness
of
peat
and
granite
which
lay
*NL*
before
him
.
He
might
have
been
the
very
spirit
of
that
terrible
place
.
*NL*
It
was
not
the
convict
.
This
man
was
far
from
the
place
where
the
*NL*
latter
had
disappeared
.
Besides
,
he
was
a
much
taller
man
.
With
a
cry
*NL*
of
surprise
I
pointed
him
out
to
the
baronet
,
but
in
the
instant
during
*NL*
which
I
had
turned
to
grasp
his
arm
the
man
was
gone
.
There
was
the
*NL*
sharp
pinnacle
of
granite
still
cutting
the
lower
edge
of
the
moon
,
but
*NL*
its
peak
bore
no
trace
of
that
silent
and
motionless
figure
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
wished
to
go
in
that
direction
and
to
search
the
tor
,
but
it
was
some
*NL*
distance
away
.
The
baronet
's
nerves
were
still
quivering
from
that
cry
,
*NL*
which
recalled
the
dark
story
of
his
family
,
and
he
was
not
in
the
mood
*NL*
for
fresh
adventures
.
He
had
not
seen
this
lonely
man
upon
the
tor
and
*NL*
could
not
feel
the
thrill
which
his
strange
presence
and
his
commanding
*NL*
attitude
had
given
to
me
.
``
A
warder
,
no
doubt
,
''
said
he
.
``
The
moor
*NL*
has
been
thick
with
them
since
this
fellow
escaped
.
''
Well
,
perhaps
his
*NL*
explanation
may
be
the
right
one
,
but
I
should
like
to
have
some
further
*NL*
proof
of
it
.
Today
we
mean
to
communicate
to
the
Princetown
people
where
*NL*
they
should
look
for
their
missing
man
,
but
it
is
hard
lines
that
*NL*
we
have
not
actually
had
the
triumph
of
bringing
him
back
as
our
*NL*
own
prisoner
.
Such
are
the
adventures
of
last
night
,
and
you
must
*NL*
acknowledge
,
my
dear
Holmes
,
that
I
have
done
you
very
well
in
*NL*
the
matter
of
a
report
.
Much
of
what
I
tell
you
is
no
doubt
quite
*NL*
irrelevant
,
but
still
I
feel
that
it
is
best
that
I
should
let
you
have
*NL*
all
the
facts
and
leave
you
to
select
for
yourself
those
which
will
*NL*
be
of
most
service
to
you
in
helping
you
to
your
conclusions
.
We
are
*NL*
certainly
making
some
progress
.
So
far
as
the
Barrymores
go
we
have
*NL*
found
the
motive
of
their
actions
,
and
that
has
cleared
up
the
situation
*NL*
very
much
.
But
the
moor
with
its
mysteries
and
its
strange
inhabitants
*NL*
remains
as
inscrutable
as
ever
.
Perhaps
in
my
next
I
may
be
able
to
*NL*
throw
some
light
upon
this
also
.
Best
of
all
would
it
be
if
you
could
*NL*
come
down
to
us
.
In
any
case
you
will
hear
from
me
again
in
the
course
*NL*
of
the
next
few
days
.

Chapter
10
.
Extract
from
the
Diary
of
Dr.
Watson
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
So
far
I
have
been
able
to
quote
from
the
reports
which
I
have
forwarded
*NL*
during
these
early
days
to
Sherlock
Holmes
.
Now
,
however
,
I
have
arrived
*NL*
at
a
point
in
my
narrative
where
I
am
compelled
to
abandon
this
method
*NL*
and
to
trust
once
more
to
my
recollections
,
aided
by
the
diary
which
*NL*
I
kept
at
the
time
.
A
few
extracts
from
the
latter
will
carry
me
on
to
*NL*
those
scenes
which
are
indelibly
fixed
in
every
detail
upon
my
memory
.
I
*NL*
proceed
,
then
,
from
the
morning
which
followed
our
abortive
chase
of
the
*NL*
convict
and
our
other
strange
experiences
upon
the
moor
.
*NL*
*NL*
October
16th
.
A
dull
and
foggy
day
with
a
drizzle
of
rain
.
The
house
*NL*
is
banked
in
with
rolling
clouds
,
which
rise
now
and
then
to
show
the
*NL*
dreary
curves
of
the
moor
,
with
thin
,
silver
veins
upon
the
sides
of
the
*NL*
hills
,
and
the
distant
boulders
gleaming
where
the
light
strikes
upon
*NL*
their
wet
faces
.
It
is
melancholy
outside
and
in
.
The
baronet
is
in
a
*NL*
black
reaction
after
the
excitements
of
the
night
.
I
am
conscious
myself
*NL*
of
a
weight
at
my
heart
and
a
feeling
of
impending
danger
--
ever
present
*NL*
danger
,
which
is
the
more
terrible
because
I
am
unable
to
define
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
have
I
not
cause
for
such
a
feeling
?
Consider
the
long
sequence
of
*NL*
incidents
which
have
all
pointed
to
some
sinister
influence
which
is
*NL*
at
work
around
us
.
There
is
the
death
of
the
last
occupant
of
the
Hall
,
*NL*
fulfilling
so
exactly
the
conditions
of
the
family
legend
,
and
there
*NL*
are
the
repeated
reports
from
peasants
of
the
appearance
of
a
strange
*NL*
creature
upon
the
moor
.
Twice
I
have
with
my
own
ears
heard
the
sound
*NL*
which
resembled
the
distant
baying
of
a
hound
.
It
is
incredible
,
*NL*
impossible
,
that
it
should
really
be
outside
the
ordinary
laws
of
*NL*
nature
.
A
spectral
hound
which
leaves
material
footmarks
and
fills
the
*NL*
air
with
its
howling
is
surely
not
to
be
thought
of
.
Stapleton
may
*NL*
fall
in
with
such
a
superstition
,
and
Mortimer
also
,
but
if
I
have
one
*NL*
quality
upon
earth
it
is
common
sense
,
and
nothing
will
persuade
me
to
*NL*
believe
in
such
a
thing
.
To
do
so
would
be
to
descend
to
the
level
of
*NL*
these
poor
peasants
,
who
are
not
content
with
a
mere
fiend
dog
but
must
*NL*
needs
describe
him
with
hell-fire
shooting
from
his
mouth
and
eyes
.
*NL*
Holmes
would
not
listen
to
such
fancies
,
and
I
am
his
agent
.
But
facts
*NL*
are
facts
,
and
I
have
twice
heard
this
crying
upon
the
moor
.
Suppose
*NL*
that
there
were
really
some
huge
hound
loose
upon
it
;
that
would
go
far
*NL*
to
explain
everything
.
But
where
could
such
a
hound
lie
concealed
,
where
*NL*
did
it
get
its
food
,
where
did
it
come
from
,
how
was
it
that
no
one
*NL*
saw
it
by
day
?
It
must
be
confessed
that
the
natural
explanation
offers
*NL*
almost
as
many
difficulties
as
the
other
.
And
always
,
apart
from
the
*NL*
hound
,
there
is
the
fact
of
the
human
agency
in
London
,
the
man
in
the
*NL*
cab
,
and
the
letter
which
warned
Sir
Henry
against
the
moor
.
This
at
*NL*
least
was
real
,
but
it
might
have
been
the
work
of
a
protecting
friend
*NL*
as
easily
as
of
an
enemy
.
Where
is
that
friend
or
enemy
now
?
Has
he
*NL*
remained
in
London
,
or
has
he
followed
us
down
here
?
Could
he
--
could
he
*NL*
be
the
stranger
whom
I
saw
upon
the
tor
?
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
true
that
I
have
had
only
the
one
glance
at
him
,
and
yet
there
are
*NL*
some
things
to
which
I
am
ready
to
swear
.
He
is
no
one
whom
I
have
seen
*NL*
down
here
,
and
I
have
now
met
all
the
neighbours
.
The
figure
was
far
*NL*
taller
than
that
of
Stapleton
,
far
thinner
than
that
of
Frankland
.
*NL*
Barrymore
it
might
possibly
have
been
,
but
we
had
left
him
behind
us
,
*NL*
and
I
am
certain
that
he
could
not
have
followed
us
.
A
stranger
then
is
*NL*
still
dogging
us
,
just
as
a
stranger
dogged
us
in
London
.
We
have
never
*NL*
shaken
him
off
.
If
I
could
lay
my
hands
upon
that
man
,
then
at
last
we
*NL*
might
find
ourselves
at
the
end
of
all
our
difficulties
.
To
this
one
*NL*
purpose
I
must
now
devote
all
my
energies
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
first
impulse
was
to
tell
Sir
Henry
all
my
plans
.
My
second
and
*NL*
wisest
one
is
to
play
my
own
game
and
speak
as
little
as
possible
to
*NL*
anyone
.
He
is
silent
and
distrait
.
His
nerves
have
been
strangely
shaken
*NL*
by
that
sound
upon
the
moor
.
I
will
say
nothing
to
add
to
his
anxieties
,
*NL*
but
I
will
take
my
own
steps
to
attain
my
own
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
a
small
scene
this
morning
after
breakfast
.
Barrymore
asked
leave
*NL*
to
speak
with
Sir
Henry
,
and
they
were
closeted
in
his
study
some
little
*NL*
time
.
Sitting
in
the
billiard-room
I
more
than
once
heard
the
sound
of
*NL*
voices
raised
,
and
I
had
a
pretty
good
idea
what
the
point
was
which
was
*NL*
under
discussion
.
After
a
time
the
baronet
opened
his
door
and
called
*NL*
for
me
.
``
Barrymore
considers
that
he
has
a
grievance
,
''
he
said
.
``
He
*NL*
thinks
that
it
was
unfair
on
our
part
to
hunt
his
brother-in-law
down
*NL*
when
he
,
of
his
own
free
will
,
had
told
us
the
secret
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
butler
was
standing
very
pale
but
very
collected
before
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
may
have
spoken
too
warmly
,
sir
,
''
said
he
,
``
and
if
I
have
,
I
am
sure
*NL*
that
I
beg
your
pardon
.
At
the
same
time
,
I
was
very
much
surprised
when
*NL*
I
heard
you
two
gentlemen
come
back
this
morning
and
learned
that
you
*NL*
had
been
chasing
Selden
.
The
poor
fellow
has
enough
to
fight
against
*NL*
without
my
putting
more
upon
his
track
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
had
told
us
of
your
own
free
will
it
would
have
been
a
different
*NL*
thing
,
''
said
the
baronet
,
``
you
only
told
us
,
or
rather
your
wife
only
*NL*
told
us
,
when
it
was
forced
from
you
and
you
could
not
help
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
think
you
would
have
taken
advantage
of
it
,
Sir
Henry
--
indeed
*NL*
I
did
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
man
is
a
public
danger
.
There
are
lonely
houses
scattered
over
the
*NL*
moor
,
and
he
is
a
fellow
who
would
stick
at
nothing
.
You
only
want
to
*NL*
get
a
glimpse
of
his
face
to
see
that
.
Look
at
Mr.
Stapleton
's
house
,
*NL*
for
example
,
with
no
one
but
himself
to
defend
it
.
There
's
no
safety
for
*NL*
anyone
until
he
is
under
lock
and
key
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
'll
break
into
no
house

I
give
you
my
solemn
word
upon
that
.
*NL*
But
he
will
never
trouble
anyone
in
this
country
again
.
I
assure
you
,
*NL*
Sir
Henry
,
that
in
a
very
few
days
the
necessary
arrangements
will
have
*NL*
been
made
and
he
will
be
on
his
way
to
South
America
.
For
God
's
sake
,
*NL*
sir
,
I
beg
of
you
not
to
let
the
police
know
that
he
is
still
on
the
*NL*
moor
.
They
have
given
up
the
chase
there
,
and
he
can
lie
quiet
until
the
*NL*
ship
is
ready
for
him
.
You
ca
n't
tell
on
him
without
getting
my
wife
and
*NL*
me
into
trouble

I
beg
you
,
sir

to
say
nothing
to
the
police

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
say
,
Watson
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
shrugged
my
shoulders
.
``
If
he
were
safely
out
of
the
country
it
would
*NL*
relieve
the
tax-payer
of
a
burden

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
about
the
chance
of
his
holding
someone
up
before
he
goes

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
would
not
do
anything
so
mad
,
sir

We
have
provided
him
with
all
*NL*
that
he
can
want
.
To
commit
a
crime
would
be
to
show
where
he
was
*NL*
hiding
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true
,
''
said
Sir
Henry
.
``
Well
,
Barrymore
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
bless
you

and
thank
you

been
taken
again

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
guess
we
are
aiding

abetting
a

after
what
*NL*
we
have
heard
I
do
n't
feel

*NL*
*NL*
With
a
few
broken
words
of
gratitude
the
man
turned
,
but
he
hesitated
*NL*
and
then
came
back
.
*NL*
*NL*

know
something

have
said

it
was
long
after
the
inquest

I
found

out

I

never

about

poor
Sir

The

were
both
upon

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Sir
Henry
,
your
uncle
had
a
letter
that
morning
.
He
had
usually
a
*NL*
great
many
letters
,
for
he
was
a
public
man
and
well
known
for
his
kind
*NL*
heart
,
so
that
everyone
who
was
in
trouble
was
glad
to
turn
to
him
.
But
*NL*
that
morning
,
as
it
chanced
,
there
was
only
this
one
letter
,
so
I
took
*NL*
the
more
notice
of
it
.
It
was
from
Coombe
Tracey
,
and
it
was
addressed
*NL*
in
a
woman
's
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
I
thought
no
more
of
the
matter
,
and
never
would
have
done
*NL*
had
it
not
been
for
my
wife
.
Only
a
few
weeks
ago
she
was
cleaning
out
*NL*
Sir
Charles
's
study
--
it
had
never
been
touched
since
his
death
--
and
she
*NL*
found
the
ashes
of
a
burned
letter
in
the
back
of
the
grate
.
The
greater
*NL*
part
of
it
was
charred
to
pieces
,
but
one
little
slip
,
the
end
of
a
*NL*
page
,
hung
together
,
and
the
writing
could
still
be
read
,
though
it
was
*NL*
gray
on
a
black
ground
.
It
seemed
to
us
to
be
a
postscript
at
the
end
*NL*
of
the
letter
and
it
said
:

Please

please

burn

this
letter

be
at

ten

Beneath
it
were
signed

the
initials

*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
got
that
slip

*NL*
*NL*

No

I
took
no

it

*NL*
``
Well

it
was
immediately

then
again

we
were
both

very
fond
of
Sir

as
we
*NL*
well
might
be
considering
all
that
he
has
done
for

.
To
rake
this
*NL*
up
could
n't
help
our
poor
master
,
and
it
's
well
to
go
carefully
when
*NL*
there
's
a
lady
in
the
case
.
Even
the
best
of
us

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You

might
injure
his

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

sir

I
thought
no
good
could
come
of
it

But
now
you
have
been
*NL*
kind
to
us
,
and
I
feel
as
if
it
would
be
treating
you
unfairly
not
to
*NL*
tell

*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good

Barrymore

When
the
butler
had
left
us
Sir
*NL*
Henry
turned
to
me
.
``
Well
,
Watson
,
what
do
you
think
of
this
new
light
?

*NL*
*NL*

It
seems
to
leave
the
darkness
rather
blacker
than
before

*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
think
.
But
if
we
can
only
trace
L.
L.
it
should
clear
up
the
whole
*NL*
business
.
We
have
gained
that
much
.
We
know
that
there
is
someone
who
*NL*
has
the
facts
if
we
can
only
find
her
.
What
do
you
think
we
should
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
Holmes
know
all
about
it
at
once
.
It
will
give
him
the
clue
for
*NL*
which
he
has
been
seeking
.
I
am
much
mistaken
if
it
does
not
bring
him
*NL*
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
at
once
to
my
room
and
drew
up
my
report
of
the
morning
's
*NL*
conversation
for
Holmes
.
It
was
evident
to
me
that
he
had
been
very
busy
*NL*
of
late
,
for
the
notes
which
I
had
from
Baker
Street
were
few
and
short
,
*NL*
with
no
comments
upon
the
information
which
I
had
supplied
and
hardly
*NL*
any
reference
to
my
mission
.
No
doubt
his
blackmailing
case
is
absorbing
*NL*
all
his
faculties
.
And
yet
this
new
factor
must
surely
arrest
his
*NL*
attention
and
renew
his
interest
.
I
wish
that
he
were
here
.
*NL*
*NL*
October
17th
.
All
day
today
the
rain
poured
down
,
rustling
on
the
ivy
*NL*
and
dripping
from
the
eaves
.
I
thought
of
the
convict
out
upon
the
*NL*
bleak
,
cold
,
shelterless
moor
.
Poor
devil
!
Whatever
his
crimes
,
he
has
*NL*
suffered
something
to
atone
for
them
.
And
then
I
thought
of
that
other
*NL*
one
--
the
face
in
the
cab
,
the
figure
against
the
moon
.
Was
he
also
out
*NL*
in
that
deluged
--
the
unseen
watcher
,
the
man
of
darkness
?
In
the
evening
*NL*
I
put
on
my
waterproof
and
I
walked
far
upon
the
sodden
moor
,
full
of
*NL*
dark
imaginings
,
the
rain
beating
upon
my
face
and
the
wind
whistling
*NL*
about
my
ears
.
God
help
those
who
wander
into
the
great
mire
now
,
for
*NL*
even
the
firm
uplands
are
becoming
a
morass
.
I
found
the
black
tor
upon
*NL*
which
I
had
seen
the
solitary
watcher
,
and
from
its
craggy
summit
I
*NL*
looked
out
myself
across
the
melancholy
downs
.
Rain
squalls
drifted
*NL*
across
their
russet
face
,
and
the
heavy
,
slate-coloured
clouds
hung
*NL*
low
over
the
landscape
,
trailing
in
gray
wreaths
down
the
sides
of
the
*NL*
fantastic
hills
.
In
the
distant
hollow
on
the
left
,
half
hidden
by
the
*NL*
mist
,
the
two
thin
towers
of
Baskerville
Hall
rose
above
the
trees
.
They
*NL*
were
the
only
signs
of
human
life
which
I
could
see
,
save
only
those
*NL*
prehistoric
huts
which
lay
thickly
upon
the
slopes
of
the
hills
.
Nowhere
*NL*
was
there
any
trace
of
that
lonely
man
whom
I
had
seen
on
the
same
spot
*NL*
two
nights
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
walked
back
I
was
overtaken
by
Dr.
Mortimer
driving
in
his
dog-cart
*NL*
over
a
rough
moorland
track
which
led
from
the
outlying
farmhouse
of
*NL*
Foulmire
.
He
has
been
very
attentive
to
us
,
and
hardly
a
day
has
passed
*NL*
that
he
has
not
called
at
the
Hall
to
see
how
we
were
getting
on
.
He
*NL*
insisted
upon
my
climbing
into
his
dog-cart
,
and
he
gave
me
a
lift
*NL*
homeward
.
I
found
him
much
troubled
over
the
disappearance
of
his
little
*NL*
spaniel
.
It
had
wandered
on
to
the
moor
and
had
never
come
back
.
I
*NL*
gave
him
such
consolation
as
I
might
,
but
I
thought
of
the
pony
on
the
*NL*
Grimpen
Mire
,
and
I
do
not
fancy
that
he
will
see
his
little
dog
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
way
,
Mortimer
,
''
said
I
as
we
jolted
along
the
rough
road
,
``
I
*NL*
suppose
there
are
few
people
living
within
driving
distance
of
this
whom
*NL*
you
do
not
know

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hardly
any

*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
,
then
,
tell
me
the
name

any
woman

initials
are
L.
L.

*NL*
*NL*
He
thought
for
a
few
minutes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

''
said
he
.
``
There
are
a
few
gipsies
and
labouring
folk
for

*NL*
I
ca
n't
answer
,
but
among
the
farmers
or
gentry
there
is
no
one
whose
*NL*
initials
are
those
.
Wait
a
bit
though
,
''
he
added
after
a
pause
.
``
There
*NL*
is
Laura
Lyons
--
her
initials
are
L.
L.
--
but
she
lives

Coombe
Tracey

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
``

who
came
sketching
on
the
*NL*
moor
.
He
proved
to
be
a
blackguard
and
deserted
her
.
The
fault
from
what
*NL*
I
hear
may
not
have
been
entirely
on
one
side
.
Her
father
refused
to
*NL*
have
anything
to
do
with
her
because
she
had
married
without
his
consent
*NL*
and
perhaps
for
one
or
two
other
reasons
as
well
.
So
,
between
the
old
*NL*
sinner
and
the
young
one
the
girl
has
had
a
pretty
bad
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
does
she
live
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
fancy
old
Frankland
allows
her
a
pittance
,
but
it
can
not
be
more
,
*NL*
for
his
own
affairs
are
considerably
involved
.
Whatever
she
may
have
*NL*
deserved
one
could
not
allow
her
to
go
hopelessly
to
the
bad
.
Her
story
*NL*
got
about
,
and
several
of
the
people
here
did
something
to
enable
her
*NL*
to
earn
an
honest
living
.
Stapleton
did
for
one
,
and
Sir
Charles
for
*NL*
another
.
I
gave
a
trifle
myself
.
It
was
to
set
her
up
in
a
typewriting
*NL*
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
wanted
to
know
the
object
of
my
inquiries
,
but
I
managed
to
satisfy
*NL*
his
curiosity
without
telling
him
too
much
,
for
there
is
no
reason
why
*NL*
we
should
take
anyone
into
our
confidence
.
Tomorrow
morning
I
shall
*NL*
find
my
way
to
Coombe
Tracey
,
and
if
I
can
see
this
Mrs.
Laura
Lyons
,
of
*NL*
equivocal
reputation
,
a
long
step
will
have
been
made
towards
clearing
*NL*
one
incident
in
this
chain
of
mysteries
.
I
am
certainly
developing
the
*NL*
wisdom
of
the
serpent
,
for
when
Mortimer
pressed
his
questions
to
an
*NL*
inconvenient
extent
I
asked
him
casually
to
what
type
Frankland
's
skull
*NL*
belonged
,
and
so
heard
nothing
but
craniology
for
the
rest
of
our
drive
.
*NL*
I
have
not
lived
for
years
with
Sherlock
Holmes
for
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
only
one
other
incident
to
record
upon
this
tempestuous
and
*NL*
melancholy
day
.
This
was
my
conversation
with
Barrymore
just
now
,
which
*NL*
gives
me
one
more
strong
card
which
I
can
play
in
due
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mortimer
had
stayed
to
dinner
,
and
he
and
the
baronet
played
ecarte
*NL*
afterwards
.
The
butler
brought
me
my
coffee
into
the
library
,
and
I
took
*NL*
the
chance
to
ask
him
a
few
questions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
I
,
``
has
this
precious
relation
of
yours
departed
,
or
is
he
*NL*
still
lurking
out
yonder
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
sir
.
I
hope
to
heaven
that
he
has
gone
,
for
he
has
*NL*
brought
nothing
but
trouble
here
!
I
've
not
heard
of
him
since
I
left
out
*NL*
food
for
him
last
,
and
that
was
three
days
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
see
him
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
but
the
food
was
gone
when
next
I
went
that
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
he
was
certainly
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
would
think
,
sir
,
unless
it
was
the
other
man
who
took
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
sat
with
my
coffee-cup
halfway
to
my
lips
and
stared
at
Barrymore
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
that
there
is
another
man
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
;
there
is
another
man
upon
the
moor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
seen
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
know
of
him
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Selden
told
me
of
him
,
sir
,
a
week
ago
or
more
.
He
's
in
hiding
,
too
,
*NL*
but
he
's
not
a
convict
as
far
as
I
can
make
out
.
I
do
n't
like
it
,
Dr.
*NL*
Watson
--
I
tell
you
straight
,
sir
,
that
I
do
n't
like
it
.
''
He
spoke
with
a
*NL*
sudden
passion
of
earnestness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
listen
to
me
,
Barrymore
!
I
have
no
interest
in
this
matter
but
*NL*
that
of
your
master
.
I
have
come
here
with
no
object
except
to
help
him
.
*NL*
Tell
me
,
frankly
,
what
it
is
that
you
do
n't
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Barrymore
hesitated
for
a
moment
,
as
if
he
regretted
his
outburst
or
*NL*
found
it
difficult
to
express
his
own
feelings
in
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
these
goings-on
,
sir
,
''
he
cried
at
last
,
waving
his
hand
*NL*
towards
the
rain-lashed
window
which
faced
the
moor
.
``
There
's
foul
play
*NL*
somewhere
,
and
there
's
black
villainy
brewing
,
to
that
I
'll
swear
!
*NL*
Very
glad
I
should
be
,
sir
,
to
see
Sir
Henry
on
his
way
back
to
London
*NL*
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
is
it
that
alarms
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
at
Sir
Charles
's
death
!
That
was
bad
enough
,
for
all
that
the
*NL*
coroner
said
.
Look
at
the
noises
on
the
moor
at
night
.
There
's
not
a
*NL*
man
would
cross
it
after
sundown
if
he
was
paid
for
it
.
Look
at
this
*NL*
stranger
hiding
out
yonder
,
and
watching
and
waiting
!
What
's
he
waiting
*NL*
for
?
What
does
it
mean
?
It
means
no
good
to
anyone
of
the
name
of
*NL*
Baskerville
,
and
very
glad
I
shall
be
to
be
quit
of
it
all
on
the
day
*NL*
that
Sir
Henry
's
new
servants
are
ready
to
take
over
the
Hall
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
about
this
stranger
,
''
said
I.
``
Can
you
tell
me
anything
about
*NL*
him
?
What
did
Selden
say
?
Did
he
find
out
where
he
hid
,
or
what
he
was
*NL*
doing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
saw
him
once
or
twice
,
but
he
is
a
deep
one
and
gives
nothing
away
.
*NL*
At
first
he
thought
that
he
was
the
police
,
but
soon
he
found
that
he
*NL*
had
some
lay
of
his
own
.
A
kind
of
gentleman
he
was
,
as
far
as
he
could
*NL*
see
,
but
what
he
was
doing
he
could
not
make
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
where
did
he
say
that
he
lived
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Among
the
old
houses
on
the
hillside
--
the
stone
huts
where
the
old
folk
*NL*
used
to
live
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
about
his
food
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Selden
found
out
that
he
has
got
a
lad
who
works
for
him
and
brings
all
*NL*
he
needs
.
I
dare
say
he
goes
to
Coombe
Tracey
for
what
he
wants
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
,
Barrymore
.
We
may
talk
further
of
this
some
other
time
.
''
*NL*
When
the
butler
had
gone
I
walked
over
to
the
black
window
,
and
I
looked
*NL*
through
a
blurred
pane
at
the
driving
clouds
and
at
the
tossing
outline
*NL*
of
the
wind-swept
trees
.
It
is
a
wild
night
indoors
,
and
what
must
it
*NL*
be
in
a
stone
hut
upon
the
moor
.
What
passion
of
hatred
can
it
be
which
*NL*
leads
a
man
to
lurk
in
such
a
place
at
such
a
time
!
And
what
deep
and
*NL*
earnest
purpose
can
he
have
which
calls
for
such
a
trial
!
There
,
in
that
*NL*
hut
upon
the
moor
,
seems
to
lie
the
very
centre
of
that
problem
which
*NL*
has
vexed
me
so
sorely
.
I
swear
that
another
day
shall
not
have
passed
*NL*
before
I
have
done
all
that
man
can
do
to
reach
the
heart
of
the
*NL*
mystery
.

Chapter
11
.
The
Man
on
the
Tor
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
extract
from
my
private
diary
which
forms
the
last
chapter
has
*NL*
brought
my
narrative
up
to
the
eighteenth
of
October
,
a
time
when
these
*NL*
strange
events
began
to
move
swiftly
towards
their
terrible
conclusion
.
*NL*
The
incidents
of
the
next
few
days
are
indelibly
graven
upon
my
*NL*
recollection
,
and
I
can
tell
them
without
reference
to
the
notes
made
*NL*
at
the
time
.
I
start
them
from
the
day
which
succeeded
that
upon
which
*NL*
I
had
established
two
facts
of
great
importance
,
the
one
that
Mrs.
Laura
*NL*
Lyons
of
Coombe
Tracey
had
written
to
Sir
Charles
Baskerville
and
made
*NL*
an
appointment
with
him
at
the
very
place
and
hour
that
he
met
his
*NL*
death
,
the
other
that
the
lurking
man
upon
the
moor
was
to
be
found
*NL*
among
the
stone
huts
upon
the
hillside
.
With
these
two
facts
in
my
*NL*
possession
I
felt
that
either
my
intelligence
or
my
courage
must
be
*NL*
deficient
if
I
could
not
throw
some
further
light
upon
these
dark
*NL*
places
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
no
opportunity
to
tell
the
baronet
what
I
had
learned
about
Mrs.
*NL*
Lyons
upon
the
evening
before
,
for
Dr.
Mortimer
remained
with
him
at
*NL*
cards
until
it
was
very
late
.
At
breakfast
,
however
,
I
informed
him
*NL*
about
my
discovery
and
asked
him
whether
he
would
care
to
accompany
*NL*
me
to
Coombe
Tracey
.
At
first
he
was
very
eager
to
come
,
but
on
second
*NL*
thoughts
it
seemed
to
both
of
us
that
if
I
went
alone
the
results
might
*NL*
be
better
.
The
more
formal
we
made
the
visit
the
less
information
we
*NL*
might
obtain
.
I
left
Sir
Henry
behind
,
therefore
,
not
without
some
*NL*
prickings
of
conscience
,
and
drove
off
upon
my
new
quest
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
reached
Coombe
Tracey
I
told
Perkins
to
put
up
the
horses
,
and
*NL*
I
made
inquiries
for
the
lady
whom
I
had
come
to
interrogate
.
I
had
no
*NL*
difficulty
in
finding
her
rooms
,
which
were
central
and
well
appointed
.
*NL*
A
maid
showed
me
in
without
ceremony
,
and
as
I
entered
the
sitting-room
*NL*
a
lady
,
who
was
sitting
before
a
Remington
typewriter
,
sprang
up
with
a
*NL*
pleasant
smile
of
welcome
.
Her
face
fell
,
however
,
when
she
saw
that
*NL*
I
was
a
stranger
,
and
she
sat
down
again
and
asked
me
the
object
of
my
*NL*
visit
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
impression
left
by
Mrs.
Lyons
was
one
of
extreme
beauty
.
Her
*NL*
eyes
and
hair
were
of
the
same
rich
hazel
colour
,
and
her
cheeks
,
though
*NL*
considerably
freckled
,
were
flushed
with
the
exquisite
bloom
of
the
*NL*
brunette
,
the
dainty
pink
which
lurks
at
the
heart
of
the
sulphur
rose
.
*NL*
Admiration
was
,
I
repeat
,
the
first
impression
.
But
the
second
was
*NL*
criticism
.
There
was
something
subtly
wrong
with
the
face
,
some
*NL*
coarseness
of
expression
,
some
hardness
,
perhaps
,
of
eye
,
some
looseness
*NL*
of
lip
which
marred
its
perfect
beauty
.
But
these
,
of
course
,
are
*NL*
afterthoughts
.
At
the
moment
I
was
simply
conscious
that
I
was
in
*NL*
the
presence
of
a
very
handsome
woman
,
and
that
she
was
asking
me
the
*NL*
reasons
for
my
visit
.
I
had
not
quite
understood
until
that
instant
how
*NL*
delicate
my
mission
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
the
pleasure
,
''
said
I
,
``
of
knowing
your
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
clumsy
introduction
,
and
the
lady
made
me
feel
it
.
``
There
*NL*
is
nothing
in
common
between
my
father
and
me
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
owe
him
*NL*
nothing
,
and
his
friends
are
not
mine
.
If
it
were
not
for
the
late
Sir
*NL*
Charles
Baskerville
and
some
other
kind
hearts
I
might
have
starved
for
*NL*
all
that
my
father
cared
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
about
the
late
Sir
Charles
Baskerville
that
I
have
come
here
to
*NL*
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
freckles
started
out
on
the
lady
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
I
tell
you
about
him
?
''
she
asked
,
and
her
fingers
played
*NL*
nervously
over
the
stops
of
her
typewriter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
knew
him
,
did
you
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
already
said
that
I
owe
a
great
deal
to
his
kindness
.
If
I
am
*NL*
able
to
support
myself
it
is
largely
due
to
the
interest
which
he
took
*NL*
in
my
unhappy
situation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
correspond
with
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
lady
looked
quickly
up
with
an
angry
gleam
in
her
hazel
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
object
of
these
questions
?
''
she
asked
sharply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
object
is
to
avoid
a
public
scandal
.
It
is
better
that
I
should
ask
*NL*
them
here
than
that
the
matter
should
pass
outside
our
control
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
silent
and
her
face
was
still
very
pale
.
At
last
she
looked
up
*NL*
with
something
reckless
and
defiant
in
her
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'll
answer
,
''
she
said
.
``
What
are
your
questions
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
correspond
with
Sir
Charles
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
certainly
wrote
to
him
once
or
twice
to
acknowledge
his
delicacy
and
*NL*
his
generosity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
the
dates
of
those
letters
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
ever
met
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
once
or
twice
,
when
he
came
into
Coombe
Tracey
.
He
was
a
very
*NL*
retiring
man
,
and
he
preferred
to
do
good
by
stealth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
you
saw
him
so
seldom
and
wrote
so
seldom
,
how
did
he
know
*NL*
enough
about
your
affairs
to
be
able
to
help
you
,
as
you
say
that
he
has
*NL*
done
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
met
my
difficulty
with
the
utmost
readiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
were
several
gentlemen
who
knew
my
sad
history
and
united
to
*NL*
help
me
.
One
was
Mr.
Stapleton
,
a
neighbour
and
intimate
friend
of
Sir
*NL*
Charles
's
.
He
was
exceedingly
kind
,
and
it
was
through
him
that
Sir
*NL*
Charles
learned
about
my
affairs

*NL*
*NL*
I
knew
already
that
Sir
Charles
Baskerville
had
made
Stapleton
his
*NL*
almoner
upon
several
occasions
,
so
the
lady
's
statement
bore
the
impress
*NL*
of
truth
upon
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
ever
write
to
Sir
Charles
asking
him
to
meet
you
?
''
I
continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Lyons
flushed
with
anger
again
.
``
Really
,
sir
,
this
is
a
very
*NL*
extraordinary
question
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
,
madam
,
but
I
must
repeat
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
answer
,
certainly
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
on
the
very
day
of
Sir
Charles
's
death
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
flush
had
faded
in
an
instant
,
and
a
deathly
face
was
before
me
.
Her
*NL*
dry
lips
could
not
speak
the
``
No
''
which
I
saw
rather
than
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
your
memory
deceives
you
,
''
said
I.
``
I
could
even
quote
a
passage
*NL*
of
your
letter
.
It
ran
`
Please
,
please
,
as
you
are
a
gentleman
,
burn
*NL*
this
letter
,
and
be
at
the
gate
by
ten
o'clock

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
that
she
had
fainted
,
but
she
recovered
herself
by
a
supreme
*NL*
effort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
no
such
thing
as
a
gentleman
?
''
she
gasped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
Sir
Charles
an
injustice

He
did
burn
the
letter

But
sometimes
*NL*
a
letter
may
be
legible
even
when
burned

You
acknowledge
now
that
you
*NL*
wrote
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
did
write
it

she
cried
,
pouring
out
her
soul
in
a
torrent
of
*NL*
words
.
``
I
did
write
it
.
Why
should
I
deny
it
?
I
have
no
reason
to
be
*NL*
ashamed
of
it
.
I
wished
him
to
help
me
.
I
believed
that
if
I
had
an
*NL*
interview
I
could
gain
his
help
,
so
I
asked
him
to
meet
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
at
such
an
hour
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
had
only
just
learned
that
he
was
going
to
London
next
day

might
be
away

months
.
There
were
reasons
why
I
could
not
get
*NL*
there
earlier
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
a
rendezvous
in
the
garden
instead
of
a
visit
to
the
house
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
a
woman
could
go
alone
at
that
hour
to
a
bachelor
's
*NL*
house

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

happened
when
you
did
get
there

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never

*NL*
*NL*
``

Lyons

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I
swear
it
to
you

intervened

prevent
my

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
was
that

*NL*
*NL*
``
That

a
private

can
not

it

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
acknowledge

that
you
made
an
appointment
with
Sir

at
*NL*
the
very
hour

met
his
death

*NL*
*NL*
``
That

the
truth

*NL*
*NL*
Again
and
again
I
cross-questioned
her
,

I
could
never
get
past
that
*NL*
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

Lyons

said
I
as

rose
from
this
long
and
inconclusive

interview

call
in

in
the
first
instance
deny
having
written
to
Sir

date

*NL*
*NL*

Because

feared

that
I
might
find
myself
involved
in
a
scandal

*NL*
``
And
why
were
you

If

ask

once
again

it
was
that

were
so
*NL*
pressing
that

should
destroy
this
letter

received
*NL*
on
the
day
of
his
death

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
matter
is
a
very
private
one

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
more
reason
why
you
should
avoid
a
public
investigation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
tell
you
,
then
.
If
you
have
heard
anything
of
my
unhappy
history
*NL*
you
will
know
that
I
made
a
rash
marriage
and
had
reason
to
regret
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
heard
so
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
life
has
been
one
incessant
persecution
from
a
husband
whom
I
abhor
.
*NL*
The
law
is
upon
his
side
,
and
every
day
I
am
faced
by
the
possibility
*NL*
that
he
may
force
me
to
live
with
him
.
At
the
time
that
I
wrote
this
*NL*
letter
to
Sir
Charles
I
had
learned
that
there
was
a
prospect
of
*NL*
my
regaining
my
freedom
if
certain
expenses
could
be
met
.
It
meant
*NL*
everything
to
me
--
peace
of
mind
,
happiness
,
self-respect
--
everything
.
I
*NL*
knew
Sir
Charles
's
generosity
,
and
I
thought
that
if
he
heard
the
story
*NL*
from
my
own
lips
he
would
help
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
how
is
it
that
you
did
not
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
received
help
in
the
interval
from
another
source
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
then
,
did
you
not
write
to
Sir
Charles
and
explain
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
should
have
done
had
I
not
seen
his
death
in
the
paper
next
*NL*
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
's
story
hung
coherently
together
,
and
all
my
questions
were
*NL*
unable
to
shake
it
.
I
could
only
check
it
by
finding
if
she
had
,
indeed
,
*NL*
instituted
divorce
proceedings
against
her
husband
at
or
about
the
time
*NL*
of
the
tragedy
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
unlikely
that
she
would
dare
to
say
that
she
had
not
been
to
*NL*
Baskerville
Hall
if
she
really
had
been
,
for
a
trap
would
be
necessary
*NL*
to
take
her
there
,
and
could
not
have
returned
to
Coombe
Tracey
until
*NL*
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
.
Such
an
excursion
could
not
be
kept
*NL*
secret
.
The
probability
was
,
therefore
,
that
she
was
telling
the
truth
,
*NL*
or
,
at
least
,
a
part
of
the
truth
.
I
came
away
baffled
and
disheartened
.
*NL*
Once
again
I
had
reached
that
dead
wall
which
seemed
to
be
built
across
*NL*
every
path
by
which
I
tried
to
get
at
the
object
of
my
mission
.
And
yet
*NL*
the
more
I
thought
of
the
lady
's
face
and
of
her
manner
the
more
I
felt
*NL*
that
something
was
being
held
back
from
me
.
Why
should
she
turn
so
pale
?
*NL*
Why
should
she
fight
against
every
admission
until
it
was
forced
from
*NL*
her
?
Why
should
she
have
been
so
reticent
at
the
time
of
the
tragedy
?
*NL*
Surely
the
explanation
of
all
this
could
not
be
as
innocent
as
she
*NL*
would
have
me
believe
.
For
the
moment
I
could
proceed
no
farther
in
that
*NL*
direction
,
but
must
turn
back
to
that
other
clue
which
was
to
be
sought
*NL*
for
among
the
stone
huts
upon
the
moor
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
that
was
a
most
vague
direction
.
I
realized
it
as
I
drove
back
*NL*
and
noted
how
hill
after
hill
showed
traces
of
the
ancient
people
.
*NL*
Barrymore
's
only
indication
had
been
that
the
stranger
lived
in
one
of
*NL*
these
abandoned
huts
,
and
many
hundreds
of
them
are
scattered
throughout
*NL*
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
moor
.
But
I
had
my
own
experience
for
a
*NL*
guide
since
it
had
shown
me
the
man
himself
standing
upon
the
summit
of
*NL*
the
Black
Tor
.
That
,
then
,
should
be
the
centre
of
my
search
.
From
there
*NL*
I
should
explore
every
hut
upon
the
moor
until
I
lighted
upon
the
right
*NL*
one
.
If
this
man
were
inside
it
I
should
find
out
from
his
own
lips
,
at
*NL*
the
point
of
my
revolver
if
necessary
,
who
he
was
and
why
he
had
dogged
*NL*
us
so
long
.
He
might
slip
away
from
us
in
the
crowd
of
Regent
Street
,
*NL*
but
it
would
puzzle
him
to
do
so
upon
the
lonely
moor
.
On
the
other
*NL*
hand
,
if
I
should
find
the
hut
and
its
tenant
should
not
be
within
it
I
*NL*
must
remain
there
,
however
long
the
vigil
,
until
he
returned
.
Holmes
had
*NL*
missed
him
in
London
.
It
would
indeed
be
a
triumph
for
me
if
I
could
run
*NL*
him
to
earth
where
my
master
had
failed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Luck
had
been
against
us
again
and
again
in
this
inquiry
,
but
now
at
*NL*
last
it
came
to
my
aid
.
And
the
messenger
of
good
fortune
was
none
other
*NL*
than
Mr.
Frankland
,
who
was
standing
,
gray-whiskered
and
red-faced
,
*NL*
outside
the
gate
of
his
garden
,
which
opened
on
to
the
highroad
along
*NL*
which
I
travelled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-day
,
Dr.
Watson
,
''
cried
he
with
unwonted
good
humour
,
``
you
must
*NL*
really
give
your
horses
a
rest
and
come
in
to
have
a
glass
of
wine
and
*NL*
to
congratulate
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
feelings
towards
him
were
very
far
from
being
friendly
after
what
I
*NL*
had
heard
of
his
treatment
of
his
daughter
,
but
I
was
anxious
to
send
*NL*
Perkins
and
the
wagonette
home
,
and
the
opportunity
was
a
good
one
.
I
*NL*
alighted
and
sent
a
message
to
Sir
Henry
that
I
should
walk
over
in
time
*NL*
for
dinner
.
Then
I
followed
Frankland
into
his
dining-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
great
day
for
me
,
sir
--
one
of
the
red-letter
days
of
my
life
,
''
*NL*
he
cried
with
many
chuckles
.
``
I
have
brought
off
a
double
event
.
I
mean
*NL*
to
teach
them
in
these
parts
that
law
is
law
,
and
that
there
is
a
man
*NL*
here
who
does
not
fear
to
invoke
it
.
I
have
established
a
right
of
way
*NL*
through
the
centre
of
old
Middleton
's
park
,
slap
across
it
,
sir
,
within
*NL*
a
hundred
yards
of
his
own
front
door
.
What
do
you
think
of
that
?
We
'll
*NL*
teach
these
magnates
that
they
can
not
ride
roughshod
over
the
rights
*NL*
of
the
commoners
,
confound
them
!
And
I
've
closed
the
wood
where
the
*NL*
Fernworthy
folk
used
to
picnic
.
These
infernal
people
seem
to
think
that
*NL*
there
are
no
rights
of
property
,
and
that
they
can
swarm
where
they
like
*NL*
with
their
papers
and
their
bottles
.
Both
cases
decided
,
Dr.
Watson
,
and
*NL*
both
in
my
favour
.
I
have
n't
had
such
a
day
since
I
had
Sir
John
Morland
*NL*
for
trespass
because
he
shot
in
his
own
warren
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
on
earth
did
you
do
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
it
up
in
the
books
,
sir

It
will
repay
reading
--
Frankland
v.
*NL*
Morland
,
Court
of
Queen
's
Bench
.
It
cost
me
200
pounds
,
but
I
got
my
*NL*
verdict
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
it
do
you
any
good

*NL*
*NL*
``
None

none

am
proud

act
entirely
from
a
sense

public
duty

I
have
no
doubt
,
for
*NL*
example
,
that
the
Fernworthy
people
will
burn
me
in
effigy
tonight

*NL*
I
told
the
police
last
time
they
did
it
that
they
should
stop
these
*NL*
disgraceful
exhibitions

The
County
Constabulary
is
in

scandalous
*NL*
state
,
sir

and
it
has
not
afforded
me
the
protection
to
which
I
am
*NL*
entitled
.
The
case
of
Frankland
v.
Regina
will
bring
the
matter
before
*NL*
the
attention
of
the
public
.
I
told
them
that
they
would
have
occasion
*NL*
to
regret
their
treatment
of
me
,

already
my
words
have
come
true

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
so
?

I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
put
on
a
very
knowing
expression
.
``
Because
I
could
tell
them
*NL*
what
they
are
dying
to
know

but
nothing
would
induce
me
to
help
the
*NL*
rascals
in
any
way

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
been
casting
round
for
some
excuse
by
which
I
could
get
away
*NL*
from
his
gossip
,
but
now
I
began
to
wish
to
hear
more
of
it
.
I
had
seen
*NL*
enough
of
the
contrary
nature
of
the
old
sinner
to
understand
that
any
*NL*
strong
sign
of
interest
would
be
the
surest
way
to
stop
his
confidences
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
poaching
case
,
no
doubt

said
I
with
an
indifferent
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
,
ha

my
boy

very
much
more
important

about

*NL*
*NL*
I
stared
.
``
You
do

said
I.

*NL*
``

to
lay
their
hands
on
him

Has
it
never
struck
you
that
*NL*
the
way

catch
that
man

to
find
out
where
he
got
his
food

trace
it

*NL*
He
certainly
seemed

uncomfortably

I

he
is
anywhere
upon
the
moor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it
because
I
have
seen
with
my
own
eyes
the
messenger
who
takes
*NL*
him
his
food
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
heart
sank
for
Barrymore
.
It
was
a
serious
thing
to
be
in
the
power
*NL*
of
this
spiteful
old
busybody
.
But
his
next
remark
took
a
weight
from
my
*NL*
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
be
surprised
to
hear
that
his
food
is
taken
to
him
by
a
child
.
*NL*
I
see
him
every
day
through
my
telescope
upon
the
roof
.
He
passes
along
*NL*
the
same
path
at
the
same
hour
,
and
to
whom
should
he
be
going
except
to
*NL*
the
convict
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
was
luck
indeed
!
And
yet
I
suppressed
all
appearance
of
interest
.
A
*NL*
child
!
Barrymore
had
said
that
our
unknown
was
supplied
by
a
boy
.
It
was
*NL*
on
his
track
,
and
not
upon
the
convict
's
,
that
Frankland
had
stumbled
.
*NL*
If
I
could
get
his
knowledge
it
might
save
me
a
long
and
weary
hunt
.
But
*NL*
incredulity
and
indifference
were
evidently
my
strongest
cards
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
say
that
it
was
much
more
likely
that
it
was
the
son
of
one
of
*NL*
the
moorland
shepherds
taking
out
his
father
's
dinner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
least
appearance
of
opposition
struck
fire
out
of
the
old
autocrat
.
*NL*
His
eyes
looked
malignantly
at
me
,
and
his
gray
whiskers
bristled
like
*NL*
those
of
an
angry
cat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
sir
!
''
said
he
,
pointing
out
over
the
wide-stretching
moor
.
``
Do
*NL*
you
see
that
Black
Tor
over
yonder
?
Well
,
do
you
see
the
low
hill
beyond
*NL*
with
the
thornbush
upon
it
?
It
is
the
stoniest
part
of
the
whole
moor
.
*NL*
Is
that
a
place
where
a
shepherd
would
be
likely
to
take
his
station
?
*NL*
Your
suggestion
,
sir
,
is
a
most
absurd
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
meekly
answered
that
I
had
spoken
without
knowing
all
the
facts
.
My
*NL*
submission
pleased
him
and
led
him
to
further
confidences
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
be
sure
,
sir
,
that
I
have
very
good
grounds
before
I
come
to
an
*NL*
opinion
.
I
have
seen
the
boy
again
and
again
with
his
bundle
.
Every
*NL*
day
,
and
sometimes
twice
a
day
,
I
have
been
able
--
but
wait
a
moment
,
*NL*
Dr.
Watson
.
Do
my
eyes
deceive
me
,
or
is
there
at
the
present
moment
*NL*
something
moving
upon
that
hillside
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
several
miles
off
,
but
I
could
distinctly
see
a
small
dark
dot
*NL*
against
the
dull
green
and
gray
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
sir
,
come
!
''
cried
Frankland
,
rushing
upstairs
.
``
You
will
see
with
*NL*
your
own
eyes
and
judge
for
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
telescope
,
a
formidable
instrument
mounted
upon
a
tripod
,
stood
upon
*NL*
the
flat
leads
of
the
house
.
Frankland
clapped
his
eye
to
it
and
gave
a
*NL*
cry
of
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quick
,
Dr.
Watson
,
quick
,
before
he
passes
over
the
hill
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
he
was
,
sure
enough
,
a
small
urchin
with
a
little
bundle
upon
his
*NL*
shoulder
,
toiling
slowly
up
the
hill
.
When
he
reached
the
crest
I
saw
*NL*
the
ragged
uncouth
figure
outlined
for
an
instant
against
the
cold
blue
*NL*
sky
.
He
looked
round
him
with
a
furtive
and
stealthy
air
,
as
one
who
*NL*
dreads
pursuit
.
Then
he
vanished
over
the
hill
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
Am
I
right
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
there
is
a
boy
who
seems
to
have
some
secret
errand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
the
errand
is
even
a
county
constable
could
guess
.
But
not
*NL*
one
word
shall
they
have
from
me
,
and
I
bind
you
to
secrecy
also
,
Dr.
*NL*
Watson
.
Not
a
word
!
You
understand
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
as
you
wish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
have
treated
me
shamefully
--
shamefully
.
When
the
facts
come
out
in
*NL*
Frankland
v.
Regina
I
venture
to
think
that
a
thrill
of
indignation
will
*NL*
run
through
the
country
.
Nothing
would
induce
me
to
help
the
police
in
*NL*
any
way
.
For
all
they
cared
it
might
have
been
me
,
instead
of
my
effigy
,
*NL*
which
these
rascals
burned
at
the
stake
.
Surely
you
are
not
going
!
You
*NL*
will
help
me
to
empty
the
decanter
in
honour
of
this
great
occasion
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
resisted
all
his
solicitations
and
succeeded
in
dissuading
him
*NL*
from
his
announced
intention
of
walking
home
with
me
.
I
kept
the
road
*NL*
as
long
as
his
eye
was
on
me
,
and
then
I
struck
off
across
the
moor
and
*NL*
made
for
the
stony
hill
over
which
the
boy
had
disappeared
.
Everything
*NL*
was
working
in
my
favour
,
and
I
swore
that
it
should
not
be
through
lack
*NL*
of
energy
or
perseverance
that
I
should
miss
the
chance
which
fortune
*NL*
had
thrown
in
my
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
was
already
sinking
when
I
reached
the
summit
of
the
hill
,
and
*NL*
the
long
slopes
beneath
me
were
all
golden-green
on
one
side
and
gray
*NL*
shadow
on
the
other
.
A
haze
lay
low
upon
the
farthest
sky-line
,
out
of
*NL*
which
jutted
the
fantastic
shapes
of
Belliver
and
Vixen
Tor
.
Over
the
*NL*
wide
expanse
there
was
no
sound
and
no
movement
.
One
great
gray
bird
,
a
*NL*
gull
or
curlew
,
soared
aloft
in
the
blue
heaven
.
He
and
I
seemed
to
be
*NL*
the
only
living
things
between
the
huge
arch
of
the
sky
and
the
desert
*NL*
beneath
it
.
The
barren
scene
,
the
sense
of
loneliness
,
and
the
mystery
*NL*
and
urgency
of
my
task
all
struck
a
chill
into
my
heart
.
The
boy
was
*NL*
nowhere
to
be
seen
.
But
down
beneath
me
in
a
cleft
of
the
hills
there
*NL*
was
a
circle
of
the
old
stone
huts
,
and
in
the
middle
of
them
there
*NL*
was
one
which
retained
sufficient
roof
to
act
as
a
screen
against
the
*NL*
weather
.
My
heart
leaped
within
me
as
I
saw
it
.
This
must
be
the
burrow
*NL*
where
the
stranger
lurked
.
At
last
my
foot
was
on
the
threshold
of
his
*NL*
hiding
place
--
his
secret
was
within
my
grasp
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
approached
the
hut
,
walking
as
warily
as
Stapleton
would
do
when
*NL*
with
poised
net
he
drew
near
the
settled
butterfly
,
I
satisfied
myself
*NL*
that
the
place
had
indeed
been
used
as
a
habitation
.
A
vague
pathway
*NL*
among
the
boulders
led
to
the
dilapidated
opening
which
served
as
a
*NL*
door
.
All
was
silent
within
.
The
unknown
might
be
lurking
there
,
or
*NL*
he
might
be
prowling
on
the
moor
.
My
nerves
tingled
with
the
sense
of
*NL*
adventure
.
Throwing
aside
my
cigarette
,
I
closed
my
hand
upon
the
butt
*NL*
of
my
revolver
and
,
walking
swiftly
up
to
the
door
,
I
looked
in
.
The
*NL*
place
was
empty
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
were
ample
signs
that
I
had
not
come
upon
a
false
scent
.
This
*NL*
was
certainly
where
the
man
lived
.
Some
blankets
rolled
in
a
waterproof
*NL*
lay
upon
that
very
stone
slab
upon
which
Neolithic
man
had
once
*NL*
slumbered
.
The
ashes
of
a
fire
were
heaped
in
a
rude
grate
.
Beside
it
*NL*
lay
some
cooking
utensils
and
a
bucket
half-full
of
water
.
A
litter
of
*NL*
empty
tins
showed
that
the
place
had
been
occupied
for
some
time
,
and
I
*NL*
saw
,
as
my
eyes
became
accustomed
to
the
checkered
light
,
a
pannikin
and
*NL*
a
half-full
bottle
of
spirits
standing
in
the
corner
.
In
the
middle
of
*NL*
the
hut
a
flat
stone
served
the
purpose
of
a
table
,
and
upon
this
stood
*NL*
a
small
cloth
bundle
--
the
same
,
no
doubt
,
which
I
had
seen
through
the
*NL*
telescope
upon
the
shoulder
of
the
boy
.
It
contained
a
loaf
of
bread
,
*NL*
a
tinned
tongue
,
and
two
tins
of
preserved
peaches
.
As
I
set
it
down
*NL*
again
,
after
having
examined
it
,
my
heart
leaped
to
see
that
beneath
it
*NL*
there
lay
a
sheet
of
paper
with
writing
upon
it
.
I
raised
it
,
and
this
*NL*
was
what
I
read
,
roughly
scrawled
in
pencil
:
``
Dr.
Watson
has
gone
to
*NL*
Coombe
Tracey
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
minute
I
stood
there
with
the
paper
in
my
hands
thinking
out
the
*NL*
meaning
of
this
curt
message
.
It
was
I
,
then
,
and
not
Sir
Henry
,
who
was
*NL*
being
dogged
by
this
secret
man
.
He
had
not
followed
me
himself
,
but
*NL*
he
had
set
an
agent
--
the
boy
,
perhaps
--
upon
my
track
,
and
this
was
his
*NL*
report
.
Possibly
I
had
taken
no
step
since
I
had
been
upon
the
moor
*NL*
which
had
not
been
observed
and
reported
.
Always
there
was
this
feeling
*NL*
of
an
unseen
force
,
a
fine
net
drawn
round
us
with
infinite
skill
and
*NL*
delicacy
,
holding
us
so
lightly
that
it
was
only
at
some
supreme
moment
*NL*
that
one
realized
that
one
was
indeed
entangled
in
its
meshes
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
there
was
one
report
there
might
be
others
,
so
I
looked
round
the
hut
*NL*
in
search
of
them
.
There
was
no
trace
,
however
,
of
anything
of
the
kind
,
*NL*
nor
could
I
discover
any
sign
which
might
indicate
the
character
or
*NL*
intentions
of
the
man
who
lived
in
this
singular
place
,
save
that
he
*NL*
must
be
of
Spartan
habits
and
cared
little
for
the
comforts
of
life
.
*NL*
When
I
thought
of
the
heavy
rains
and
looked
at
the
gaping
roof
I
*NL*
understood
how
strong
and
immutable
must
be
the
purpose
which
had
kept
*NL*
him
in
that
inhospitable
abode
.
Was
he
our
malignant
enemy
,
or
was
he
by
*NL*
chance
our
guardian
angel
?
I
swore
that
I
would
not
leave
the
hut
until
*NL*
I
knew
.
*NL*
*NL*
Outside
the
sun
was
sinking
low
and
the
west
was
blazing
with
scarlet
*NL*
and
gold
.
Its
reflection
was
shot
back
in
ruddy
patches
by
the
distant
*NL*
pools
which
lay
amid
the
great
Grimpen
Mire
.
There
were
the
two
towers
*NL*
of
Baskerville
Hall
,
and
there
a
distant
blur
of
smoke
which
marked
the
*NL*
village
of
Grimpen
.
Between
the
two
,
behind
the
hill
,
was
the
house
*NL*
of
the
Stapletons
.
All
was
sweet
and
mellow
and
peaceful
in
the
golden
*NL*
evening
light
,
and
yet
as
I
looked
at
them
my
soul
shared
none
of
the
*NL*
peace
of
Nature
but
quivered
at
the
vagueness
and
the
terror
of
that
*NL*
interview
which
every
instant
was
bringing
nearer
.
With
tingling
nerves
*NL*
but
a
fixed
purpose
,
I
sat
in
the
dark
recess
of
the
hut
and
waited
with
*NL*
sombre
patience
for
the
coming
of
its
tenant
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
at
last
I
heard
him
.
Far
away
came
the
sharp
clink
of
a
boot
*NL*
striking
upon
a
stone
.
Then
another
and
yet
another
,
coming
nearer
and
*NL*
nearer
.
I
shrank
back
into
the
darkest
corner
and
cocked
the
pistol
in
*NL*
my
pocket
,
determined
not
to
discover
myself
until
I
had
an
opportunity
*NL*
of
seeing
something
of
the
stranger
.
There
was
a
long
pause
which
showed
*NL*
that
he
had
stopped
.
Then
once
more
the
footsteps
approached
and
a
*NL*
shadow
fell
across
the
opening
of
the
hut
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
lovely
evening
,
my
dear
Watson
,
''
said
a
well-known
voice
.
``
I
*NL*
really
think
that
you
will
be
more
comfortable
outside
than
in
.

Chapter

Death
on
the
Moor
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
moment
or
two
I
sat
breathless
,
hardly
able
to
believe
my
ears
.
*NL*
Then
my
senses
and
my
voice
came
back
to
me
,
while
a
crushing
weight
*NL*
of
responsibility
seemed
in
an
instant
to
be
lifted
from
my
soul
.
That
*NL*
cold
,
incisive
,
ironical
voice
could
belong
to
but
one
man
in
all
the
*NL*
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Holmes
!
''
I
cried
--
``
Holmes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
out
,
''
said
he
,
``
and
please
be
careful
with
the
revolver
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
stooped
under
the
rude
lintel
,
and
there
he
sat
upon
a
stone
outside
,
*NL*
his
gray
eyes
dancing
with
amusement
as
they
fell
upon
my
astonished
*NL*
features
.
He
was
thin
and
worn
,
but
clear
and
alert
,
his
keen
face
*NL*
bronzed
by
the
sun
and
roughened
by
the
wind
.
In
his
tweed
suit
and
*NL*
cloth
cap
he
looked
like
any
other
tourist
upon
the
moor
,
and
he
had
*NL*
contrived
,
with
that
catlike
love
of
personal
cleanliness
which
was
one
*NL*
of
his
characteristics
,
that
his
chin
should
be
as
smooth
and
his
linen
*NL*
as
perfect
as
if
he
were
in
Baker
Street
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
was
more
glad
to
see
anyone
in
my
life
,
''
said
I
as
I
wrung
him
*NL*
by
the
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
more
astonished
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
must
confess
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
surprise
was
not
all
on
one
side
,
I
assure
you
.
I
had
no
idea
that
*NL*
you
had
found
my
occasional
retreat
,
still
less
that
you
were
inside
it
,
*NL*
until
I
was
within
twenty
paces
of
the
door
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
footprint
,
I
presume
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Watson
,
I
fear
that
I
could
not
undertake
to
recognize
your
*NL*
footprint
amid
all
the
footprints
of
the
world
.
If
you
seriously
desire
*NL*
to
deceive
me
you
must
change
your
tobacconist
;
for
when
I
see
the
stub
*NL*
of
a
cigarette
marked
Bradley
,
Oxford
Street
,
I
know
that
my
friend
*NL*
Watson
is
in
the
neighbourhood
.
You
will
see
it
there

You
threw
it
down

into

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
as
much

knowing
your
admirable

was
convinced

that
you
were
sitting
in
ambush

a
weapon
within
reach

waiting
for
the
*NL*
tenant
to
return

So
you
actually

the
criminal

*NL*

I
did
not

you
were

I
was
determined
to
find
out

*NL*
``
Excellent
,
Watson
!
And
how
did
you
localize
me

You
saw
me
,
perhaps
,
on
*NL*
the
night
of
the
convict
hunt
,
when
I
was
so
imprudent
as
to
allow
the

moon

rise
behind
me

Yes

I
saw
you

have
no

searched
all
the

you
came
to
this
one

No

your
boy
had
been
observed

gave
me
a

look

*NL*
``
The
old

with
the

out

the
light
flashing
upon

He
rose
and
peeped
*NL*
into
the
hut
.
``
Ha

I
see
that
Cartwright
has
brought
up

Well

when
we
unite
our

I
expect
we
shall
have

*NL*

Well

I
am
glad
from
my
heart

you

here

for
indeed
the
*NL*
responsibility
and
the
mystery
were
both
becoming
too
much
for
my
*NL*
nerves
.
But
how
in
the
name
of
wonder
did
you
come
here
,
and
what
have
*NL*
you
been
doing
?
I
thought
that
you
were
in
Baker
Street
working
out
that
*NL*
case
of
blackmailing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
what
I
wished
you
to
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
use
me
,
and
yet
do
not
trust
me

''
I
cried
with
some
*NL*
bitterness
.
``
I
think
that
I
have
deserved
better
at
your
hands
,
Holmes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
fellow
,
you
have
been
invaluable
to
me
in
this
as
in
many
other
*NL*
cases
,
and
I
beg
that
you
will
forgive
me
if
I
have
seemed
to
play
a
*NL*
trick
upon
you
.
In
truth
,
it
was
partly
for
your
own
sake
that
I
did
it
,
*NL*
and
it
was
my
appreciation
of
the
danger
which
you
ran
which
led
me
to
*NL*
come
down
and
examine
the
matter
for
myself
.
Had
I
been
with
Sir
Henry
*NL*
and
you
it
is
confident
that
my
point
of
view
would
have
been
the
*NL*
same
as
yours
,
and
my
presence
would
have
warned
our
very
formidable
*NL*
opponents
to
be
on
their
guard
.
As
it
is
,
I
have
been
able
to
get
about
*NL*
as
I
could
not
possibly
have
done
had
I
been
living
in
the
Hall
,
and
*NL*
I
remain
an
unknown
factor
in
the
business
,
ready
to
throw
in
all
my
*NL*
weight
at
a
critical
moment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
keep
me
in
the
dark
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
you
to
know
could
not
have
helped
us
and
might
possibly
have
led
*NL*
to
my
discovery
.
You
would
have
wished
to
tell
me
something
,
or
in
your
*NL*
kindness
you
would
have
brought
me
out
some
comfort
or
other
,
and
so
an
*NL*
unnecessary
risk
would
be
run
.
I
brought
Cartwright
down
with
me
--
you
*NL*
remember
the
little
chap
at
the
express
office
--
and
he
has
seen
after
*NL*
my
simple
wants
:
a
loaf
of
bread
and
a
clean
collar
.
What
does
man
want
*NL*
more
?
He
has
given
me
an
extra
pair
of
eyes
upon
a
very
active
pair
of
*NL*
feet
,
and
both
have
been
invaluable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
my
reports
have
all
been
wasted

''
--
My
voice
trembled
as
I
recalled
*NL*
the
pains
and
the
pride
with
which
I
had
composed
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Holmes
took
a
bundle
of
papers
from
his
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
are
your
reports
,
my
dear
fellow
,
and
very
well
thumbed
,
I
assure
*NL*
you
.
I
made
excellent
arrangements
,
and
they
are
only
delayed
one
day
*NL*
upon
their
way
.
I
must
compliment
you
exceedingly
upon
the
zeal
and
*NL*
the
intelligence
which
you
have
shown
over
an
extraordinarily
difficult
*NL*
case
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
still
rather
raw
over
the
deception
which
had
been
practised
upon
*NL*
me
,
but
the
warmth
of
Holmes
's
praise
drove
my
anger
from
my
mind
.
I
*NL*
felt
also
in
my
heart
that
he
was
right
in
what
he
said
and
that
it
was
*NL*
really
best
for
our
purpose
that
I
should
not
have
known
that
he
was
*NL*
upon
the
moor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
better
,
''
said
he
,
seeing
the
shadow
rise
from
my
face
.
``
And
*NL*
now
tell
me
the
result
of
your
visit
to
Mrs.
Laura
Lyons
--
it
was
not
*NL*
difficult
for
me
to
guess
that
it
was
to
see
her
that
you
had
gone
,
for
*NL*
I
am
already
aware
that
she
is
the
one
person
in
Coombe
Tracey
who
might
*NL*
be
of
service
to
us
in
the
matter
.
In
fact
,
if
you
had
not
gone
today
it
*NL*
is
exceedingly
probable
that
I
should
have
gone
tomorrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
had
set
and
dusk
was
settling
over
the
moor
.
The
air
had
turned
*NL*
chill
and
we
withdrew
into
the
hut
for
warmth
.
There
,
sitting
together
*NL*
in
the
twilight
,
I
told
Holmes
of
my
conversation
with
the
lady
.
So
*NL*
interested
was
he
that
I
had
to
repeat
some
of
it
twice
before
he
was
*NL*
satisfied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
most
important
,
''
said
he
when
I
had
concluded
.
``
It
fills
up
a
*NL*
gap
which
I
had
been
unable
to
bridge
in
this
most
complex
affair
.
You
*NL*
are
aware
,
perhaps
,
that
a
close
intimacy
exists
between
this
lady
and
*NL*
the
man
Stapleton
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
know
of
a
close
intimacy

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
can
be
no
doubt
about
the
matter
.
They
meet
,
they
write
,
there
*NL*
is
a
complete
understanding
between
them
.
Now
,
this
puts
a
very
powerful
*NL*
weapon
into
our
hands
.
If
I
could
only
use
it
to
detach
his
wife
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
wife
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
giving
you
some
information
now
,
in
return
for
all
that
you
have
*NL*
given
me
.
The
lady
who
has
passed
here
as
Miss
Stapleton
is
in
reality
*NL*
his
wife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
heavens
,
Holmes
!
Are
you
sure
of
what
you
say
?
How
could
he
have
*NL*
permitted
Sir
Henry
to
fall
in
love
with
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
Henry
's
falling
in
love
could
do
no
harm
to
anyone
except
Sir
*NL*
Henry
.
He
took
particular
care
that
Sir
Henry
did
not
make
love
to
her
,
*NL*
as
you
have
yourself
observed
.
I
repeat
that
the
lady
is
his
wife
and
*NL*
not
his
sister
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
this
elaborate
deception
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
he
foresaw
that
she
would
be
very
much
more
useful
to
him
in
*NL*
the
character
of
a
free
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
my
unspoken
instincts
,
my
vague
suspicions
,
suddenly
took
shape
and
*NL*
centred
upon
the
naturalist
.
In
that
impassive
colourless
man
,
with
his
*NL*
straw
hat
and
his
butterfly-net
,
I
seemed
to
see
something
terrible
--
a
*NL*
creature
of
infinite
patience
and
craft
,
with
a
smiling
face
and
a
*NL*
murderous
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
he
,
then
,
who
is
our
enemy
--
it
is
he
who
dogged
us
in
London
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
read
the
riddle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
warning
--
it
must
have
come
from
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
shape
of
some
monstrous
villainy
,
half
seen
,
half
guessed
,
loomed
*NL*
through
the
darkness
which
had
girt
me
so
long
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
are
you
sure
of
this
,
Holmes
?
How
do
you
know
that
the
woman
is
his
*NL*
wife
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
he
so
far
forgot
himself
as
to
tell
you
a
true
piece
of
*NL*
autobiography
upon
the
occasion
when
he
first
met
you
,
and
I
dare
say
*NL*
he
has
many
a
time
regretted
it
since
.
He
was
once
a
schoolmaster
in
*NL*
the
north
of
England
.
Now
,
there
is
no
one
more
easy
to
trace
than
a
*NL*
schoolmaster
.
There
are
scholastic
agencies
by
which
one
may
identify
*NL*
any
man
who
has
been
in
the
profession
.
A
little
investigation
showed
me
*NL*
that
a
school
had
come
to
grief
under
atrocious
circumstances
,
and
that
*NL*
the
man
who
had
owned
it
--
the
name
was
different
--
had
disappeared
with
*NL*
his
wife
.
The
descriptions
agreed
.
When
I
learned
that
the
missing
man
*NL*
was
devoted
to
entomology
the
identification
was
complete
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
darkness
was
rising
,
but
much
was
still
hidden
by
the
shadows
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
this
woman
is
in
truth
his
wife
,
where
does
Mrs.
Laura
Lyons
come
*NL*
in
?

I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
one
of
the
points
upon
which
your
own
researches
have
shed
a
*NL*
light
.
Your
interview
with
the
lady
has
cleared
the
situation
very
*NL*
much
.
I
did
not
know
about
a
projected
divorce
between
herself
and
her
*NL*
husband
.
In
that
case
,
regarding
Stapleton
as
an
unmarried
man

she
*NL*
counted
no
doubt
upon
becoming
his
wife

*NL*
``
And
when
she
is
undeceived
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

then
we
may
find
the
lady
of
service

It
must
be
our
first
duty
*NL*
to
see
her
--
both
of
us
--
tomorrow

Do
n't
you
think
,
Watson
,
that
you
are
*NL*
away
from
your
charge
rather
long

Your
place
should
be

Baskerville

Hall

*NL*
The
last
red
streaks
had
faded
away
in
the
west
and
night
had
settled
*NL*
upon
the
moor
.
A
few
faint
stars
were
gleaming
in
a
violet
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
last
question
,
Holmes
,
''
I
said
as
I
rose
.
``
Surely
there
is
no
need
*NL*
of
secrecy
between
you
and
me

What
is
the
meaning
of
it
all
?
What
is
he
*NL*
after
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Holmes
's
voice
sank
as
he
answered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
murder
,
Watson
--
refined
,
cold-blooded
,
deliberate
murder
.
Do
not
*NL*
ask
me
for
particulars

My
nets
are
closing
upon
him

even
as
his
are
*NL*
upon
Sir
Henry

and
with
your
help
he
is
already
almost
at
my
mercy

*NL*
There
is
but
one
danger
which
can
threaten
us
.
It
is
that
he
should
*NL*
strike
before
we
are
ready
to
do
so
.
Another
day
--
two
at
the
most
--
and
*NL*
I
have
my
case
complete
,
but
until
then
guard
your
charge
as
closely
*NL*
as
ever
a
fond
mother
watched
her
ailing
child

Your
mission
today
has
*NL*
justified
itself
,
and
yet
I
could
almost
wish
that
you
had
not
left
his
*NL*
side

Hark
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
terrible
scream
--
a
prolonged
yell
of
horror
and
anguish
--
burst
out
of
*NL*
the
silence
of
the
moor
.
That
frightful
cry
turned
the
blood
to
ice
in
*NL*
my
veins
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
God
!

I
gasped
.
``
What
is
it
?
What
does
it
mean
?

*NL*
*NL*
Holmes
had
sprung
to
his
feet
,
and
I
saw
his
dark
,
athletic
outline
at
*NL*
the
door
of
the
hut
,
his
shoulders
stooping
,
his
head
thrust
forward
,
*NL*
his
face
peering
into
the
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
!
''
he
whispered
.
``
Hush
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
cry
had
been
loud
on
account
of
its
vehemence
,
but
it
had
pealed
out
*NL*
from
somewhere
far
off
on
the
shadowy
plain
.
Now
it
burst
upon
our
ears
,
*NL*
nearer
,
louder
,
more
urgent
than
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
it
?
''
Holmes
whispered
;
and
I
knew
from
the
thrill
of
his
voice
*NL*
that
he
,
the
man
of
iron
,
was
shaken
to
the
soul
.
``
Where
is
it
,
Watson
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
I
think
.

I
pointed
into
the
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
there
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
the
agonized
cry
swept
through
the
silent
night
,
louder
and
much
*NL*
nearer
than
ever
.
And
a
new
sound
mingled
with
it
,
a
deep
,
muttered
*NL*
rumble
,
musical
and
yet
menacing
,
rising
and
falling
like
the
low
,
*NL*
constant
murmur
of
the
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
hound
!
''
cried
Holmes
.
``
Come
,
Watson
,
come
!
Great
heavens
,
if
we
are
*NL*
too
late

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
started
running
swiftly
over
the
moor
,
and
I
had
followed
at
his
*NL*
heels
.
But
now
from
somewhere
among
the
broken
ground
immediately
in
*NL*
front
of
us
there
came
one
last
despairing
yell
,
and
then
a
dull
,
heavy
*NL*
thud
.
We
halted
and
listened
.
Not
another
sound
broke
the
heavy
silence
*NL*
of
the
windless
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
saw
Holmes
put
his
hand
to
his
forehead
like
a
man
distracted
.
He
*NL*
stamped
his
feet
upon
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
beaten
us

Watson

late

No
,
no

surely
not

*NL*
*NL*
``
Fool
that
I
was
to
hold
my
hand

And
you
,
Watson
,
see
what
comes
of
*NL*
abandoning
your
charge
!
But
,
by
Heaven
,
if
the
worst
has
happened
we
'll
*NL*
avenge
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Blindly
we
ran
through
the
gloom
,
blundering
against
boulders
,
forcing
*NL*
our
way
through
gorse
bushes
,
panting
up
hills
and
rushing
down
slopes
,
*NL*
heading
always
in
the
direction
whence
those
dreadful
sounds
had
come
.
*NL*
At
every
rise
Holmes
looked
eagerly
round
him
,
but
the
shadows
were
*NL*
thick
upon
the
moor
,
and
nothing
moved
upon
its
dreary
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
see
anything
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
hark
,
what
is
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
low
moan
had
fallen
upon
our
ears
.
There
it
was
again
upon
our
left
!
*NL*
On
that
side
a
ridge
of
rocks
ended
in
a
sheer
cliff
which
overlooked
*NL*
a
stone-strewn
slope
.
On
its
jagged
face
was
spread-eagled
some
dark
,
*NL*
irregular
object
.
As
we
ran
towards
it
the
vague
outline
hardened
into
*NL*
a
definite
shape
.
It
was
a
prostrate
man
face
downward
upon
the
ground
,
*NL*
the
head
doubled
under
him
at
a
horrible
angle
,
the
shoulders
rounded
*NL*
and
the
body
hunched
together
as
if
in
the
act
of
throwing
a
somersault
.
*NL*
So
grotesque
was
the
attitude
that
I
could
not
for
the
instant
realize
*NL*
that
that
moan
had
been
the
passing
of
his
soul
.
Not
a
whisper
,
not
a
*NL*
rustle
,
rose
now
from
the
dark
figure
over
which
we
stooped
.
Holmes
laid
*NL*
his
hand
upon
him
and
held
it
up
again
with
an
exclamation
of
horror
.
*NL*
The
gleam
of
the
match
which
he
struck
shone
upon
his
clotted
fingers
*NL*
and
upon
the
ghastly
pool
which
widened
slowly
from
the
crushed
skull
*NL*
of
the
victim
.
And
it
shone
upon
something
else
which
turned
our
hearts
*NL*
sick
and
faint
within
us
--
the
body
of
Sir
Henry
Baskerville
!
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
chance
of
either
of
us
forgetting
that
peculiar
ruddy
tweed
*NL*
suit
--
the
very
one
which
he
had
worn
on
the
first
morning
that
we
had
*NL*
seen
him
in
Baker
Street
.
We
caught
the
one
clear
glimpse
of
it
,
and
*NL*
then
the
match
flickered
and
went
out
,
even
as
the
hope
had
gone
out
*NL*
of
our
souls
.
Holmes
groaned
,
and
his
face
glimmered
white
through
the
*NL*
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
brute
!
The
brute
!
''
I
cried
with
clenched
hands
.
``
Oh
Holmes
,
I
shall
*NL*
never
forgive
myself
for
having
left
him
to
his
fate

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
more
to
blame

In
order
to
have
my

well
*NL*
rounded

I
have
thrown
away
the
life

my
client

It

*NL*
the
greatest
blow
which
has
befallen
me
in
my
career

But
how
could
I
*NL*
know

how
could
I
know

that
he
would
risk
his
life
alone
upon
the
moor

in
the
face
of
all
my
warnings

*NL*

heard

to
save
him
!
Where
is
this
brute
of
a
hound
which
drove
*NL*
him
to
his
death
?
It
may
be
lurking
among
these
rocks
at
this

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
shall

I
will
see
to
that

Uncle

nephew
have
been
murdered
--
the
*NL*
one
frightened
to
death
by
the
very
sight
of
a
beast
which
he
thought
*NL*
to
be
supernatural
,
the
other
driven
to
his
end
in
his
wild
flight
to
*NL*
escape
from
it
.
But
now
we
have
to
prove
the
connection
between
the
*NL*
man
and
the
beast
.
Save
from
what
we
heard
,
we
can
not
even
swear
to
the
*NL*
existence
of
the
latter
,
since
Sir
Henry
has
evidently
died
from
the
*NL*
fall
.
But
,
by
heavens
,
cunning
as
he
is
,
the
fellow
shall
be
in
my
power
*NL*
before
another
day
is
past
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
stood
with
bitter
hearts
on
either
side
of
the
mangled
body
,
*NL*
overwhelmed
by
this
sudden
and
irrevocable
disaster
which
had
brought
*NL*
all
our
long
and
weary
labours
to
so
piteous
an
end
.
Then
as
the
moon
*NL*
rose
we
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
rocks
over
which
our
poor
friend
had
*NL*
fallen
,
and
from
the
summit
we
gazed
out
over
the
shadowy
moor
,
half
*NL*
silver
and
half
gloom
.
Far
away
,
miles
off
,
in
the
direction
of
Grimpen
,
*NL*
a
single
steady
yellow
light
was
shining
.
It
could
only
come
from
the
*NL*
lonely
abode
of
the
Stapletons
.
With
a
bitter
curse
I
shook
my
fist
at
*NL*
it
as
I
gazed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
we
not
seize
him
at
once
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
case
is
not
complete

The
fellow
is
wary
and
cunning
to
the
last

degree

It
is
not
what
we
know
,
but
what
we
can
prove
.
If
we
make
one
*NL*
false
move
the
villain
may
escape
us
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
we
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
will
be
plenty

Tonight
we
can
only
perform
*NL*
the
last
offices

our
poor
friend

''
*NL*
*NL*
Together
we
made
our
way
down
the
precipitous
slope
and
approached
the
*NL*
body
,
black
and
clear
against
the
silvered
stones
.
The
agony
of
those
*NL*
contorted
limbs
struck
me
with
a
spasm
of
pain
and
blurred
my
eyes
with
*NL*
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
send
for
help

Holmes

We
can
not
carry
him
all
the
way
to
the
*NL*
Hall

Good
heavens
,
are
you
mad
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
uttered
a
cry
and
bent
over
the
body
.
Now
he
was
dancing
and
*NL*
laughing
and
wringing
my
hand
.
Could
this
be
my
stern
,
self-contained
*NL*
friend
?
These
were
hidden
fires
,
indeed
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
beard
!
A
beard
!
The
man
has
a
beard
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
beard
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
the
baronet

it
is
--
why
,
it
is
my
neighbour
,
the
convict
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
feverish
haste
we
had
turned
the
body
over
,
and
that
dripping
beard
*NL*
was
pointing
up
to
the
cold
,
clear
moon
.
There
could
be
no
doubt
about
*NL*
the
beetling
forehead
,
the
sunken
animal
eyes
.
It
was
indeed
the
same
*NL*
face
which
had
glared
upon
me
in
the
light
of
the
candle
from
over
the
*NL*
rock
--
the
face
of
Selden
,
the
criminal
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
in
an
instant
it
was
all
clear
to
me
.
I
remembered
how
the
baronet
*NL*
had
told
me
that
he
had
handed
his
old
wardrobe
to
Barrymore
.
Barrymore
*NL*
had
passed
it
on
in
order
to
help
Selden
in
his
escape
.
Boots
,
shirt
,
*NL*
cap
--
it
was
all
Sir
Henry
's
.
The
tragedy
was
still
black
enough
,
but
*NL*
this
man
had
at
least
deserved
death
by
the
laws
of
his
country
.
I
told
*NL*
Holmes
how
the
matter
stood
,
my
heart
bubbling
over
with
thankfulness
*NL*
and
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
the
clothes
have
been
the
poor
devil
's
death
,
''
said
he
.
``
It
is
*NL*
clear
enough
that
the
hound
has
been
laid
on
from
some
article
of
*NL*
Sir
Henry

--
the
boot
which
was
abstracted
in
the
hotel
,
in
all
*NL*
probability
--
and
so
ran
this
man
down
.
There
is
one
very
singular
thing
,
*NL*
however
:
How
came
Selden
,
in
the
darkness
,
to
know
that
the
hound
was
on
*NL*
his
trail
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
heard
him

*NL*
*NL*
``
To
hear
a
hound
upon
the
moor
would
not
work
a
hard
man
like
this
*NL*
convict
into
such
a
paroxysm
of
terror
that
he
would
risk
recapture
*NL*
by
screaming
wildly
for
help
.
By
his
cries
he
must
have
run
a
long
way
*NL*
after
he
knew
the
animal
was
on
his
track

How
did
he
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
greater
mystery
to
me
is
why
this
hound

presuming
that
all
our
*NL*
conjectures

correct

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
presume
nothing

be
loose

I
suppose

run
loose
upon
the
moor

Stapleton
would
not
let

go

had
reason
to
think
that
Sir

would
be
there

My
difficulty

the
more
formidable
of

two

we

shall
very
shortly
get
an
explanation
of
yours
,
while
mine
may
remain
*NL*
forever
a
mystery

The
question
now
is
,
what
shall
we
do
with
this
poor
*NL*
wretch

can
not
leave

*NL*
``
Exactly

have
no

*NL*
*NL*
A
figure
was
approaching
us
over
the
moor
,
and
I
saw
the
dull
red
glow
*NL*
of
a
cigar
.
The
moon
shone
upon
him
,
and
I
could
distinguish
the
dapper
*NL*
shape
and
jaunty
walk
of
the
naturalist
.
He
stopped
when
he
saw
us
,
and
*NL*
then
came
on
again

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

He
hurried
past

and
stooped
over
the
dead
man

I
*NL*
heard
a
sharp
intake
of
his
breath
and
the
cigar
fell
from
his
fingers

turned
a
ghastly
face
upon

by

he
had

overcome

his
disappointment

He
looked
sharply
from

shocking

naturally
became
alarmed

his
eyes
darted
again
from

to
indicate

I
think
that
if
we
put
something
over
his
face
he
will
be
safe
until
*NL*
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
it
was
arranged
.
Resisting
Stapleton
's
offer
of
hospitality
,
*NL*
Holmes
and
I
set
off
to
Baskerville
Hall
,
leaving
the
naturalist
to
*NL*
return
alone
.
Looking
back
we
saw
the
figure
moving
slowly
away
over
the
*NL*
broad
moor
,
and
behind
him
that
one
black
smudge
on
the
silvered
slope
*NL*
which
showed
where
the
man
was
lying
who
had
come
so
horribly
to
his
*NL*
end
.

Fixing
the
Nets

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
're
at
close
grips
at
last
,
''
said
Holmes
as
we
walked
together
across
*NL*
the
moor
.
``
What
a
nerve
the
fellow
has
!
How
he
pulled
himself
together
*NL*
in
the
face
of
what
must
have
been
a
paralyzing
shock
when
he
found
that
*NL*
the
wrong
man
had
fallen
a
victim
to
his
plot
.
I
told
you
in
London
,
*NL*
Watson
,
and
I
tell
you
now
again
,
that
we
have
never
had
a
foeman
more
*NL*
worthy
of
our
steel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
that
he
has
seen
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
was
I
at
first
.
But
there
was
no
getting
out
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
effect
do
you
think
it
will
have
upon
his
plans
now
that
he
knows
*NL*
you
are
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
may
cause
him
to
be
more
cautious
,
or
it
may
drive
him
to
desperate
*NL*
measures
at
once
.
Like
most
clever
criminals
,
he
may
be
too
confident
in
*NL*
his
own
cleverness
and
imagine
that
he
has
completely
deceived
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
we
not
arrest
him
at
once
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Watson
,
you
were
born
to
be
a
man
of
action
.
Your
instinct
is
*NL*
always
to
do
something
energetic
.
But
supposing
,
for
argument
's
sake
,
*NL*
that
we
had
him
arrested
tonight
,
what
on
earth
the
better
off
should
*NL*
we
be
for
that
?
We
could
prove
nothing
against
him
.
There
's
the
devilish
*NL*
cunning
of
it
!
If
he
were
acting
through
a
human
agent
we
could
get
some
*NL*
evidence
,
but
if
we
were
to
drag
this
great
dog
to
the
light
of
day
it
*NL*
would
not
help
us
in
putting
a
rope
round
the
neck
of
its
master
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
we
have
a
case
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
shadow
of
one
--
only
surmise
and
conjecture

We
should
be
laughed
*NL*
out
of
court
if
we
came
with
such
a
story
and
such
evidence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
Sir
Charles
's
death
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Found
dead
without
a
mark
upon
him

You
and
I
know
that
he
died
of
*NL*
sheer
fright

we
know
also
what
frightened
him
,
but
how
are
we
to
*NL*
get
twelve
stolid
jurymen
to
know
it
?
What
signs
are
there
of
a
hound
?
*NL*
Where
are
the
marks
of
its
fangs
?
Of
course
we
know
that
a
hound
does
*NL*
not
bite
a
dead
body
and
that
Sir
Charles
was
dead
before
ever
the
*NL*
brute
overtook
him
.
But
we
have
to
prove
all
this

do
it

``
Well

then

tonight

*NL*
*NL*
``

better
off

Again

there
was
no
direct

connection
between
the
hound
and
the
man
's
death

We
never
saw
the
*NL*
hound

We
heard
it
,
but
we
could
not
prove
that
it
was
running
upon
this
*NL*
man
's
trail
.
There
is
a
complete
absence
of
motive
.
No
,
my
dear
fellow
;
*NL*
we
must
reconcile
ourselves
to
the
fact
that
we
have
no
case
at
present
,
*NL*
and
that
it
is
worth
our
while
to
run
any
risk
in

to
establish
*NL*
one
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
do
you
propose

do
so

*NL*
*NL*

I
have
great
hopes

what
Mrs.
Laura
Lyons

made
clear
to
her

I
have
my
own
plan
as

well

Sufficient
for
tomorrow
is
the
evil
thereof

I
hope
before
the

day
is
past

have
the

*NL*
*NL*
I
could
draw
nothing
further
from
him
,
and
he
walked
,
lost
in
thought
,
*NL*
as
far
as
the
Baskerville
gates

*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
coming
up

*NL*
*NL*

Yes

I
see
no

for
further
concealment

one
last
word

*NL*
Watson

Say
nothing
of
the
hound
to
Sir
Henry
.
Let
him
think
that
*NL*
Selden
's
death
was
as
Stapleton
would
have
us
believe
.
He
will
have
a
*NL*
better
nerve
for
the
ordeal
which
he
will
have
to
undergo
tomorrow
,
*NL*
when
he
is
engaged
,
if
I
remember
your
report
aright
,
to
dine
with
these
*NL*
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
am
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
must
excuse
yourself
and
he
must
go
alone
.
That
will
be
easily
*NL*
arranged
.
And
now
,
if
we
are
too
late
for
dinner
,
I
think
that
we
are
*NL*
both
ready
for
our
suppers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Henry
was
more
pleased
than
surprised
to
see
Sherlock
Holmes
,
for
he
*NL*
had
for
some
days
been
expecting
that
recent
events
would
bring
him
down
*NL*
from
London
.
He
did
raise
his
eyebrows
,
however
,
when
he
found
that
my
*NL*
friend
had
neither
any
luggage
nor
any
explanations
for
its
absence
.
*NL*
Between
us
we
soon
supplied
his
wants
,
and
then
over
a
belated
supper
*NL*
we
explained
to
the
baronet
as
much
of
our
experience
as
it
seemed
*NL*
desirable
that
he
should
know
.
But
first
I
had
the
unpleasant
duty
of
*NL*
breaking
the
news
to
Barrymore
and
his
wife
.
To
him
it
may
have
been
an
*NL*
unmitigated
relief
,
but
she
wept
bitterly
in
her
apron
.
To
all
the
world
*NL*
he
was
the
man
of
violence
,
half
animal
and
half
demon
;
but
to
her
he
*NL*
always
remained
the
little
wilful
boy
of
her
own
girlhood
,
the
child
who
*NL*
had
clung
to
her
hand
.
Evil
indeed
is
the
man
who
has
not
one
woman
to
*NL*
mourn
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
been
moping
in
the
house
all
day
since
Watson
went
off
in
the
*NL*
morning
,
''
said
the
baronet
.
``
I
guess
I
should
have
some
credit
,
for
I
*NL*
have
kept
my
promise
.
If
I
had
n't
sworn
not
to
go
about
alone
I
might
*NL*
have
had
a
more
lively
evening
,
for
I
had
a
message
from
Stapleton
*NL*
asking
me
over
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
doubt
that
you
would
have
had
a
more
lively
evening
,
''
said
*NL*
Holmes
drily
.
``
By
the
way
,
I
do
n't
suppose
you
appreciate
that
we
have
*NL*
been
mourning
over
you
as
having
broken
your
neck
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Henry
opened
his
eyes
.
``
How
was
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
poor
wretch
was
dressed
in
your
clothes
.
I
fear
your
servant
who
*NL*
gave
them
to
him
may
get
into
trouble
with
the
police
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
unlikely

There
was
no
mark
on
any
of
them

as
far
as
I
know

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
lucky
for
him

in
fact

it
's
lucky
for
all
of
you

since
you
are
*NL*
all
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
law
in
this
matter
.
I
am
not
sure
that
as
*NL*
a
conscientious
detective
my
first
duty
is
not
to
arrest
the
whole
*NL*
household

Watson
's
reports
are
most
incriminating
documents

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
about
the
case

asked
the
baronet
.
``
Have
you
made
anything
out

of
the
tangle

I
do
n't
know
that
Watson

I
are
much
the
wiser
since
*NL*
we
came
down

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
that
I
shall
be
in
a
position
to
make
the
situation
rather
more
*NL*
clear
to
you
before
long
.
It
has
been
an
exceedingly
difficult
and
most
*NL*
complicated
business
.
There
are
several
points
upon
which
we
still
want
*NL*
light

but
it
is
coming
all
the
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
've
had
one
experience

as
Watson
has
no

told
you

We
heard
the

hound
on
the
moor
,
so
I
can
swear
that
it
is
not
all
empty
superstition
.
*NL*
I
had
something
to
do
with
dogs
when
I
was
out
West
,
and
I
know
one
when
*NL*
I
hear
one
.
If
you
can
muzzle
that
one
and
put
him
on
a
chain
I
'll
be
*NL*
ready
to
swear
you
are
the
greatest
detective
of
all
time

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
will
muzzle
him

chain
him
all

will
give
me

your

*NL*
*NL*

Whatever
you

no

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stopped
suddenly
and
stared
fixedly
up
over
my
head
into
the
air
.
The
*NL*
lamp
beat
upon
his
face
,
and
so
intent
was
it
and
so
still
that
it
might
*NL*
have
been
that
of
a
clear-cut
classical
statue
,
a
personification
of
*NL*
alertness
and
expectation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it

we
both
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
see
as
he
looked
down
that
he
was
repressing
some
internal
*NL*
emotion
.
His
features
were
still
composed
,
but
his
eyes
shone
with
*NL*
amused
exultation

*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
the
admiration

said
he
as
he
waved
his
hand
*NL*
towards
the
line
of
portraits
which
covered
the
opposite
wall
.
``
Watson

gazed

interest

some
surprise
upon

portrait

Holmes
,

meek-mannered

Holmes
said
little
more

the
picture
of
the
old
roysterer
seemed
to
*NL*
have
a
fascination
for
him

and
his
eyes
were
continually
fixed
upon
it
*NL*
during
supper

It
was
not
until
later

when
Sir
Henry
had
gone
to
his
*NL*
room
,
that
I
was
able
to
follow
the
trend
of
his
thoughts

He
led
me
*NL*
back
into
the
banqueting-hall
,
his
bedroom
candle
in
his
hand

he
*NL*
held
it
up
against
the
time-stained
portrait
on

wall

*NL*
``
Do
you
see
anything

I
looked
at
the
broad
plumed

the
curling
love-locks

the
white
lace
*NL*
collar

and
the
straight
,
severe
face
which
was
framed
between
them

It
*NL*
was
not
a
brutal
countenance
,
but
it
was
prim

hard
,
and
stern
,
with
a

firm-set

thin-lipped

He
stood
upon

,
holding
up
the
light
in
his

he
curved
his

I
cried
in
amazement
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
face
of
Stapleton
had
sprung
out
of
the
canvas
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
,
you
see
it
now
.
My
eyes
have
been
trained
to
examine
faces
and
not
*NL*
their
trimmings
.
It
is
the
first
quality
of
a
criminal
investigator
that
*NL*
he
should
see
through
a
disguise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
this
is
marvellous
.
It
might
be
his
portrait
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
is
an
interesting
instance
of
a
throwback
,
which
appears
to
be
*NL*
both
physical
and
spiritual
.
A
study
of
family
portraits
is
enough
*NL*
to
convert
a
man
to
the
doctrine
of
reincarnation
.
The
fellow
is
a
*NL*
Baskerville
--
that
is
evident
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
With
designs
upon
the
succession

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
.
This
chance
of
the
picture
has
supplied
us
with
one
of
our
*NL*
most
obvious
missing
links

We
have
him
,
Watson
,
we
have
him
,
and
I
dare
*NL*
swear
that
before
tomorrow
night
he
will
be
fluttering
in
our
net
as
*NL*
helpless
as
one
of
his
own
butterflies
.
A
pin
,
a
cork
,
and
a
card
,
and
*NL*
we
add
him
to
the
Baker
Street
collection

''
He
burst
into
one
of
his
*NL*
rare
fits
of
laughter
as
he
turned
away
from
the
picture
.
I
have
not
*NL*
heard
him
laugh
often
,
and
it
has
always
boded
ill
to
somebody
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
up
betimes
in
the
morning
,
but
Holmes
was
afoot
earlier
still
,
for
*NL*
I
saw
him
as
I
dressed
,
coming
up
the
drive
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
we
should
have
a
full
day
today
,
''
he
remarked
,
and
he
rubbed
his
*NL*
hands
with
the
joy
of
action
.
``
The
nets
are
all
in
place
,
and
the
drag
*NL*
is
about
to
begin

We
'll
know
before
the
day
is
out
whether
we
have
*NL*
caught
our
big
,
leanjawed
pike

whether
he
has
got
through
the
*NL*
meshes

*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
been
on
the
moor
already

*NL*
*NL*

I

I
can
promise

I

The
baronet

face
perceptibly
lengthened
.

*NL*
``
I
hoped

you
were
going

*NL*
``
My

trust

tell
your

have
been
happy

that
urgent

required

*NL*
I
saw
by
the
baronet

clouded

that

was
deeply
hurt

regarded
as
our
desertion

possible

reach
London
in
the
afternoon

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
much
astounded
by
this
programme
,
though
I
remembered
that
Holmes
*NL*
had
said
to
Stapleton
on
the
night
before
that
his
visit
would
terminate
*NL*
next
day
.
It
had
not
crossed
my
mind
however
,
that
he
would
wish
me
to
*NL*
go
with
him
,
nor
could
I
understand
how
we
could
both
be
absent
at
a
*NL*
moment
which
he
himself
declared
to
be
critical
.
There
was
nothing
for
*NL*
it
,
however
,
but
implicit
obedience
;
so
we
bade
good-bye
to
our
rueful
*NL*
friend
,
and
a
couple
of
hours
afterwards
we
were
at
the
station
of
*NL*
Coombe
Tracey
and
had
dispatched
the
trap
upon
its
return
journey
.
A
*NL*
small
boy
was
waiting
upon
the
platform
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Any
orders
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
take
this
train
to
town
,
Cartwright
.
The
moment
you
arrive
you
*NL*
will
send
a
wire
to
Sir
Henry
Baskerville
,
in
my
name
,
to
say
that
if
he
*NL*
finds
the
pocketbook
which
I
have
dropped
he
is
to
send
it
by
registered
*NL*
post
to
Baker
Street
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
ask
at
the
station
office
if
there
is
a
message
for
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
returned
with
a
telegram
,
which
Holmes
handed
to
me
.
It
ran
:
*NL*
*NL*
Wire
received
.
Coming
down
with
unsigned
warrant
.
Arrive
five-forty
.
*NL*
Lestrade
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
in
answer
to
mine
of
this
morning

He
is
the
best
of
the
*NL*
professionals
,
I
think
,
and
we
may
need
his
assistance
.
Now
,
Watson
,
I
*NL*
think
that
we
can
not
employ
our
time
better
than
by
calling
upon
your
*NL*
acquaintance
,
Mrs.
Laura
Lyons
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
plan
of
campaign
was
beginning
to
be
evident
.
He
would
use
the
*NL*
baronet
in
order
to
convince
the
Stapletons
that
we
were
really
gone
,
*NL*
while
we
should
actually
return
at
the
instant
when
we
were
likely
to
*NL*
be
needed
.
That
telegram
from
London
,
if
mentioned
by
Sir
Henry
to
the
*NL*
Stapletons
,
must
remove
the
last
suspicions
from
their
minds
.
Already
I
*NL*
seemed
to
see
our
nets
drawing
closer
around
that
leanjawed
pike
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Laura
Lyons
was
in
her
office
,
and
Sherlock
Holmes
opened
his
*NL*
interview
with
a
frankness
and
directness
which
considerably
amazed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
investigating
the
circumstances
which
attended
the
death

*NL*
late

said
he
.
``
My

communicated

what
you
have
*NL*
withheld
in
connection
with
that
matter

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
I
withheld

she
asked
defiantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
confessed
that
you
asked
Sir

to
be
at
the
gate
at
ten
*NL*
o'clock

know
that
that
was
the
place
and
hour
of
his

withheld

the
connection

between
these
events

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no

establishing

*NL*
wish

be
perfectly
frank

We
regard

one
of
murder

the
evidence
may
implicate
not

your

his

as
well

*NL*
*NL*
The
lady
sprang
from
her
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
fact

*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Lyons
had
resumed
her
seat
.
Her
hands
were
grasping
the
arms
of
her
*NL*
chair
,
and
I
saw
that
the
pink
nails
had
turned
white
with
the
pressure

of
her
grip

said
again

``

Sherlock

shrugged
his
shoulders

*NL*
``

if
you
can
do
so

*NL*
*NL*
The
fierce
flash
of
her
eyes
said
more
than
any
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
come
prepared
to
do

Holmes
,
drawing
several
papers
*NL*
from
his
pocket

no

*NL*
*NL*
She
glanced
at
them
,
and
then
looked
up
at
us
with
the
set
,
rigid
face
*NL*
of
a
desperate
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.

she
said

this

offered
me
marriage

lied
to

in
every
conceivable
way

Not
one
word

has
he
ever

told
me

And
why
--
why

I
imagined
that
all
was
for
my
own

But
now
*NL*
I
see
that
I
was
never
anything

a
tool

Ask

what
you

like

there

nothing

One
thing
I

should
certainly
be
suspected
if
the
facts
came
out
.
He
frightened
me
*NL*
into
remaining
silent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
so
.
But
you
had
your
suspicions
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
hesitated
and
looked
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
him
,
''
she
said
.
``
But
if
he
had
kept
faith
with
me
I
should
*NL*
always
have
done
so
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
that
on
the
whole
you
have
had
a
fortunate
escape
,
''
said
*NL*
Sherlock
Holmes
.
``
You
have
had
him
in
your
power
and
he
knew
it
,
and
yet
*NL*
you
are
alive
.
You
have
been
walking
for
some
months
very
near
to
the
*NL*
edge
of
a
precipice
.
We
must
wish
you
good-morning
now
,
Mrs.
Lyons
,
and
*NL*
it
is
probable
that
you
will
very
shortly
hear
from
us
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
case
becomes
rounded
off
,
and
difficulty
after
difficulty
thins
*NL*
away
in
front
of
us
,
''
said
Holmes
as
we
stood
waiting
for
the
arrival
of
*NL*
the
express
from
town
.
``
I
shall
soon
be
in
the
position
of
being
able
*NL*
to
put
into
a
single
connected
narrative
one
of
the
most
singular
*NL*
and
sensational
crimes
of
modern
times
.
Students
of
criminology
will
*NL*
remember
the
analogous
incidents
in
Godno
,
in
Little
Russia
,
in
the
year
*NL*
'
66
,
and
of
course
there
are
the
Anderson
murders
in
North
Carolina
,
but
*NL*
this
case
possesses
some
features
which
are
entirely
its
own
.
Even
now
*NL*
we
have
no
clear
case
against
this
very
wily
man
.
But
I
shall
be
very
*NL*
much
surprised
if
it
is
not
clear
enough
before
we
go
to
bed
this
*NL*
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
London
express
came
roaring
into
the
station
,
and
a
small
,
wiry
*NL*
bulldog
of
a
man
had
sprung
from
a
first-class
carriage
.
We
all
three
*NL*
shook
hands
,
and
I
saw
at
once
from
the
reverential
way
in
which
*NL*
Lestrade
gazed
at
my
companion
that
he
had
learned
a
good
deal
since
*NL*
the
days
when
they
had
first
worked
together
.
I
could
well
remember
*NL*
the
scorn
which
the
theories
of
the
reasoner
used
then
to
excite
in
the
*NL*
practical
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anything
good
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
biggest
thing
for
years
,
''
said
Holmes
.
``
We
have
two
hours
before
*NL*
we
need
think
of
starting
.
I
think
we
might
employ
it
in
getting
some
*NL*
dinner
and
then
,
Lestrade
,
we
will
take
the
London
fog
out
of
your
*NL*
throat
by
giving
you
a
breath
of
the
pure
night
air
of
Dartmoor
.
Never
*NL*
been
there
?
Ah
,
well
,
I
do
n't
suppose
you
will
forget
your
first
visit

Chapter
14
.
The
Hound
of
the
Baskervilles
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
Sherlock
Holmes
's
defects
--
if
,
indeed
,
one
may
call
it
a
*NL*
defect
--
was
that
he
was
exceedingly
loath
to
communicate
his
full
plans
*NL*
to
any
other
person
until
the
instant
of
their
fulfilment
.
Partly
it
*NL*
came
no
doubt
from
his
own
masterful
nature
,
which
loved
to
dominate
and
*NL*
surprise
those
who
were
around
him
.
Partly
also
from
his
professional
*NL*
caution
,
which
urged
him
never
to
take
any
chances
.
The
result
,
however
,
*NL*
was
very
trying
for
those
who
were
acting
as
his
agents
and
assistants
.
*NL*
I
had
often
suffered
under
it
,
but
never
more
so
than
during
that
long
*NL*
drive
in
the
darkness
.
The
great
ordeal
was
in
front
of
us
;
at
last
we
*NL*
were
about
to
make
our
final
effort
,
and
yet
Holmes
had
said
nothing
,
*NL*
and
I
could
only
surmise
what
his
course
of
action
would
be
.
My
nerves
*NL*
thrilled
with
anticipation
when
at
last
the
cold
wind
upon
our
faces
and
*NL*
the
dark
,
void
spaces
on
either
side
of
the
narrow
road
told
me
that
we
*NL*
were
back
upon
the
moor
once
again
.
Every
stride
of
the
horses
and
every
*NL*
turn
of
the
wheels
was
taking
us
nearer
to
our
supreme
adventure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
conversation
was
hampered
by
the
presence
of
the
driver
of
the
hired
*NL*
wagonette
,
so
that
we
were
forced
to
talk
of
trivial
matters
when
our
*NL*
nerves
were
tense
with
emotion
and
anticipation
.
It
was
a
relief
to
me
,
*NL*
after
that
unnatural
restraint
,
when
we
at
last
passed
Frankland
's
*NL*
house
and
knew
that
we
were
drawing
near
to
the
Hall
and
to
the
scene
*NL*
of
action
.
We
did
not
drive
up
to
the
door
but
got
down
near
the
gate
of
*NL*
the
avenue
.
The
wagonette
was
paid
off
and
ordered
to
return
to
Coombe
*NL*
Tracey
forthwith
,
while
we
started
to
walk
to
Merripit
House
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
armed
,
Lestrade
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
detective
smiled
.
``
As
long
as
I
have
my
trousers
I
have
a
*NL*
hip-pocket
,
and
as
long
as
I
have
my
hip-pocket
I
have
something
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
!
My
friend
and
I
are
also
ready
for
emergencies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
mighty
close
about
this
affair
,
Mr.
Holmes
.
What
's
the
game
*NL*
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
waiting
game
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
word
,
it
does
not
seem
a
very
cheerful
place
,
''
said
the
detective
*NL*
with
a
shiver
,
glancing
round
him
at
the
gloomy
slopes
of
the
hill
and
*NL*
at
the
huge
lake
of
fog
which
lay
over
the
Grimpen
Mire
.
``
I
see
the
*NL*
lights
of
a
house
ahead
of
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
Merripit
House
and
the
end
of
our
journey
.
I
must
request
you
*NL*
to
walk
on
tiptoe
and
not
to
talk
above
a
whisper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
moved
cautiously
along
the
track
as
if
we
were
bound
for
the
house
,
*NL*
but
Holmes
halted
us
when
we
were
about
two
hundred
yards
from
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
will
do
,
''
said
he
.
``
These
rocks
upon
the
right
make
an
admirable
*NL*
screen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
to
wait
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
we
shall
make
our
little
ambush
here
.
Get
into
this
hollow
,
*NL*
Lestrade
.
You
have
been
inside
the
house
,
have
you
not
,
Watson
?
Can
you
*NL*
tell
the
position
of
the
rooms
?
What
are
those
latticed
windows
at
this
*NL*
end
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
they
are
the
kitchen
windows
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
one
beyond
,
which
shines
so
brightly
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
certainly
the
dining-room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
blinds
are
up
.
You
know
the
lie
of
the
land
best
.
Creep
forward
*NL*
quietly
and
see
what
they
are
doing
--
but
for
heaven
's
sake
do
n't
let
*NL*
them
know
that
they
are
watched
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
tiptoed
down
the
path
and
stooped
behind
the
low
wall
which
surrounded
*NL*
the
stunted
orchard
.
Creeping
in
its
shadow
I
reached
a
point
whence
I
*NL*
could
look
straight
through
the
uncurtained
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
only
two
men
in
the
room
,
Sir
Henry
and
Stapleton
.
They
sat
*NL*
with
their
profiles
towards
me
on
either
side
of
the
round
table
.
Both
*NL*
of
them
were
smoking
cigars
,
and
coffee
and
wine
were
in
front
of
them
.
*NL*
Stapleton
was
talking
with
animation
,
but
the
baronet
looked
pale
and
*NL*
distrait
.
Perhaps
the
thought
of
that
lonely
walk
across
the
ill-omened
*NL*
moor
was
weighing
heavily
upon
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
watched
them
Stapleton
rose
and
left
the
room
,
while
Sir
Henry
*NL*
filled
his
glass
again
and
leaned
back
in
his
chair
,
puffing
at
his
*NL*
cigar
.
I
heard
the
creak
of
a
door
and
the
crisp
sound
of
boots
upon
*NL*
gravel
.
The
steps
passed
along
the
path
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
*NL*
under
which
I
crouched
.
Looking
over
,
I
saw
the
naturalist
pause
at
the
*NL*
door
of
an
out-house
in
the
corner
of
the
orchard
.
A
key
turned
in
*NL*
a
lock
,
and
as
he
passed
in
there
was
a
curious
scuffling
noise
from
*NL*
within
.
He
was
only
a
minute
or
so
inside
,
and
then
I
heard
the
key
turn
*NL*
once
more
and
he
passed
me
and
reentered
the
house
.
I
saw
him
rejoin
his
*NL*
guest
,
and
I
crept
quietly
back
to
where
my
companions
were
waiting
to
*NL*
tell
them
what
I
had
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
say
,
Watson
,
that
the
lady
is
not
there
?
''
Holmes
asked
when
I
had
*NL*
finished
my
report
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
can
she
be
,
then
,
since
there
is
no
light
in
any
other
room
*NL*
except
the
kitchen
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
think
where
she
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
said
that
over
the
great
Grimpen
Mire
there
hung
a
dense
,
white
*NL*
fog
.
It
was
drifting
slowly
in
our
direction
and
banked
itself
up
like
a
*NL*
wall
on
that
side
of
us
,
low
but
thick
and
well
defined
.
The
moon
shone
*NL*
on
it
,
and
it
looked
like
a
great
shimmering
ice-field
,
with
the
heads
*NL*
of
the
distant
tors
as
rocks
borne
upon
its
surface
.
Holmes
's
face
*NL*
was
turned
towards
it
,
and
he
muttered
impatiently
as
he
watched
its
*NL*
sluggish
drift
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
moving
towards
us
,
Watson
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
serious
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
serious
,
indeed
--
the
one
thing
upon
earth
which
could
have
*NL*
disarranged
my
plans
.
He
ca
n't
be
very
long
,
now
.
It
is
already
ten
*NL*
o'clock
.
Our
success
and
even
his
life
may
depend
upon
his
coming
out
*NL*
before
the
fog
is
over
the
path
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
night
was
clear
and
fine
above
us
.
The
stars
shone
cold
and
bright
,
*NL*
while
a
half-moon
bathed
the
whole
scene
in
a
soft
,
uncertain
light
.
*NL*
Before
us
lay
the
dark
bulk
of
the
house
,
its
serrated
roof
and
*NL*
bristling
chimneys
hard
outlined
against
the
silver-spangled
sky
.
Broad
*NL*
bars
of
golden
light
from
the
lower
windows
stretched
across
the
orchard
*NL*
and
the
moor
.
One
of
them
was
suddenly
shut
off
.
The
servants
had
left
*NL*
the
kitchen
.
There
only
remained
the
lamp
in
the
dining-room
where
the
*NL*
two
men
,
the
murderous
host
and
the
unconscious
guest
,
still
chatted
*NL*
over
their
cigars
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
minute
that
white
woolly
plain
which
covered
one-half
of
the
moor
*NL*
was
drifting
closer
and
closer
to
the
house
.
Already
the
first
thin
*NL*
wisps
of
it
were
curling
across
the
golden
square
of
the
lighted
window
.
*NL*
The
farther
wall
of
the
orchard
was
already
invisible
,
and
the
trees
*NL*
were
standing
out
of
a
swirl
of
white
vapour
.
As
we
watched
it
the
*NL*
fog-wreaths
came
crawling
round
both
corners
of
the
house
and
rolled
*NL*
slowly
into
one
dense
bank
on
which
the
upper
floor
and
the
roof
*NL*
floated
like
a
strange
ship
upon
a
shadowy
sea
.
Holmes
struck
his
hand
*NL*
passionately
upon
the
rock
in
front
of
us
and
stamped
his
feet
in
his
*NL*
impatience
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
he
is
n't
out
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
path
will
be
covered
.
In
*NL*
half
an
hour
we
wo
n't
be
able
to
see
our
hands
in
front
of
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
we
move
farther
back
upon
higher
ground
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
think
it
would
be
as
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
as
the
fog-bank
flowed
onward
we
fell
back
before
it
until
we
were
*NL*
half
a
mile
from
the
house
,
and
still
that
dense
white
sea
,
with
the
*NL*
moon
silvering
its
upper
edge
,
swept
slowly
and
inexorably
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
going
too
far
,
''
said
Holmes
.
``
We
dare
not
take
the
chance
of
his
*NL*
being
overtaken
before
he
can
reach
us
.
At
all
costs
we
must
hold
our
*NL*
ground
where
we
are
.
''
He
dropped
on
his
knees
and
clapped
his
ear
to
the
*NL*
ground
.
``
Thank
God
,
I
think
that
I
hear
him
coming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
sound
of
quick
steps
broke
the
silence
of
the
moor
.
Crouching
among
*NL*
the
stones
we
stared
intently
at
the
silver-tipped
bank
in
front
of
us
.
*NL*
The
steps
grew
louder
,
and
through
the
fog
,
as
through
a
curtain
,
there
*NL*
stepped
the
man
whom
we
were
awaiting
.
He
looked
round
him
in
surprise
*NL*
as
he
emerged
into
the
clear
,
starlit
night
.
Then
he
came
swiftly
along
*NL*
the
path
,
passed
close
to
where
we
lay
,
and
went
on
up
the
long
slope
*NL*
behind
us
.
As
he
walked
he
glanced
continually
over
either
shoulder
,
*NL*
like
a
man
who
is
ill
at
ease
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hist
!
''
cried
Holmes
,
and
I
heard
the
sharp
click
of
a
cocking
pistol
.
*NL*
``
Look
out
!
It
's
coming
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
thin
,
crisp
,
continuous
patter
from
somewhere
in
the
heart
*NL*
of
that
crawling
bank
.
The
cloud
was
within
fifty
yards
of
where
we
lay
,
*NL*
and
we
glared
at
it
,
all
three
,
uncertain
what
horror
was
about
to
break
*NL*
from
the
heart
of
it
.
I
was
at
Holmes
's
elbow
,
and
I
glanced
for
an
*NL*
instant
at
his
face
.
It
was
pale
and
exultant
,
his
eyes
shining
brightly
*NL*
in
the
moonlight
.
But
suddenly
they
started
forward
in
a
rigid
,
fixed
*NL*
stare
,
and
his
lips
parted
in
amazement
.
At
the
same
instant
Lestrade
*NL*
gave
a
yell
of
terror
and
threw
himself
face
downward
upon
the
ground
.
*NL*
I
sprang
to
my
feet
,
my
inert
hand
grasping
my
pistol
,
my
mind
paralyzed
*NL*
by
the
dreadful
shape
which
had
sprung
out
upon
us
from
the
shadows
of
*NL*
the
fog
.
A
hound
it
was
,
an
enormous
coal-black
hound
,
but
not
such
a
*NL*
hound
as
mortal
eyes
have
ever
seen
.
Fire
burst
from
its
open
mouth
,
its
*NL*
eyes
glowed
with
a
smouldering
glare
,
its
muzzle
and
hackles
and
dewlap
*NL*
were
outlined
in
flickering
flame
.
Never
in
the
delirious
dream
of
*NL*
a
disordered
brain
could
anything
more
savage
,
more
appalling
,
more
*NL*
hellish
be
conceived
than
that
dark
form
and
savage
face
which
broke
*NL*
upon
us
out
of
the
wall
of
fog
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
long
bounds
the
huge
black
creature
was
leaping
down
the
track
,
*NL*
following
hard
upon
the
footsteps
of
our
friend
.
So
paralyzed
were
we
by
*NL*
the
apparition
that
we
allowed
him
to
pass
before
we
had
recovered
our
*NL*
nerve
.
Then
Holmes
and
I
both
fired
together
,
and
the
creature
gave
a
*NL*
hideous
howl
,
which
showed
that
one
at
least
had
hit
him
.
He
did
not
*NL*
pause
,
however
,
but
bounded
onward
.
Far
away
on
the
path
we
saw
Sir
*NL*
Henry
looking
back
,
his
face
white
in
the
moonlight
,
his
hands
raised
in
*NL*
horror
,
glaring
helplessly
at
the
frightful
thing
which
was
hunting
him
*NL*
down
.
But
that
cry
of
pain
from
the
hound
had
blown
all
our
fears
to
the
*NL*
winds
.
If
he
was
vulnerable
he
was
mortal
,
and
if
we
could
wound
him
we
*NL*
could
kill
him
.
Never
have
I
seen
a
man
run
as
Holmes
ran
that
night
.
I
*NL*
am
reckoned
fleet
of
foot
,
but
he
outpaced
me
as
much
as
I
outpaced
the
*NL*
little
professional
.
In
front
of
us
as
we
flew
up
the
track
we
heard
*NL*
scream
after
scream
from
Sir
Henry
and
the
deep
roar
of
the
hound
.
I
was
*NL*
in
time
to
see
the
beast
spring
upon
its
victim
,
hurl
him
to
the
ground
,
*NL*
and
worry
at
his
throat
.
But
the
next
instant
Holmes
had
emptied
five
*NL*
barrels
of
his
revolver
into
the
creature
's
flank
.
With
a
last
howl
of
*NL*
agony
and
a
vicious
snap
in
the
air
,
it
rolled
upon
its
back
,
four
feet
*NL*
pawing
furiously
,
and
then
fell
limp
upon
its
side
.
I
stooped
,
panting
,
*NL*
and
pressed
my
pistol
to
the
dreadful
,
shimmering
head
,
but
it
was
*NL*
useless
to
press
the
trigger
.
The
giant
hound
was
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Henry
lay
insensible
where
he
had
fallen
.
We
tore
away
his
collar
,
*NL*
and
Holmes
breathed
a
prayer
of
gratitude
when
we
saw
that
there
was
*NL*
no
sign
of
a
wound
and
that
the
rescue
had
been
in
time
.
Already
our
*NL*
friend
's
eyelids
shivered
and
he
made
a
feeble
effort
to
move
.
Lestrade
*NL*
thrust
his
brandy-flask
between
the
baronet
's
teeth
,
and
two
frightened
*NL*
eyes
were
looking
up
at
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
God
!
''
he
whispered
.
``
What
was
it
?
What
,
in
heaven
's
name
,
was
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
dead
,
whatever
it
is
,
''
said
Holmes
.
``
We
've
laid
the
family
ghost
*NL*
once
and
forever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
mere
size
and
strength
it
was
a
terrible
creature
which
was
lying
*NL*
stretched
before
us
.
It
was
not
a
pure
bloodhound
and
it
was
not
a
pure
*NL*
mastiff
;
but
it
appeared
to
be
a
combination
of
the
two
--
gaunt
,
savage
,
*NL*
and
as
large
as
a
small
lioness
.
Even
now
in
the
stillness
of
death
,
*NL*
the
huge
jaws
seemed
to
be
dripping
with
a
bluish
flame
and
the
small
,
*NL*
deep-set
,
cruel
eyes
were
ringed
with
fire
.
I
placed
my
hand
upon
the
*NL*
glowing
muzzle
,
and
as
I
held
them
up
my
own
fingers
smouldered
and
*NL*
gleamed
in
the
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Phosphorus
,
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
cunning
preparation
of
it
,
''
said
Holmes
,
sniffing
at
the
dead
animal
.
*NL*
``
There
is
no
smell
which
might
have
interfered
with
his
power
of
scent
.
*NL*
We
owe
you
a
deep
apology
,
Sir
Henry
,
for
having
exposed
you
to
this
*NL*
fright
.
I
was
prepared
for
a
hound
,
but
not
for
such
a
creature
as
this
.
*NL*
And
the
fog
gave
us
little
time
to
receive
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
saved
my
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Having
first
endangered
it
.
Are
you
strong
enough
to
stand
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
me
another
mouthful
of
that
brandy
and
I
shall
be
ready
for
*NL*
anything
.
So
!
Now
,
if
you
will
help
me
up
.
What
do
you
propose
to
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
leave
you
here
.
You
are
not
fit
for
further
adventures
tonight
.
If
*NL*
you
will
wait
,
one
or
other
of
us
will
go
back
with
you
to
the
Hall
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
tried
to
stagger
to
his
feet
;
but
he
was
still
ghastly
pale
and
*NL*
trembling
in
every
limb
.
We
helped
him
to
a
rock
,
where
he
sat
shivering
*NL*
with
his
face
buried
in
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
leave
you
now
,
''
said
Holmes
.
``
The
rest
of
our
work
must
be
*NL*
done
,
and
every
moment
is
of
importance
.
We
have
our
case
,
and
now
we
*NL*
only
want
our
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
thousand
to
one
against
our
finding
him
at
the
house
,
''
he
*NL*
continued
as
we
retraced
our
steps
swiftly
down
the
path
.
``
Those
shots
*NL*
must
have
told
him
that
the
game
was
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
were
some
distance
off
,
and
this
fog
may
have
deadened
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
followed
the
hound
to
call
him
off
--
of
that
you
may
be
certain
.
No
,
*NL*
no
,
he
's
gone
by
this
time
!
But
we
'll
search
the
house
and
make
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
front
door
was
open
,
so
we
rushed
in
and
hurried
from
room
to
*NL*
room
to
the
amazement
of
a
doddering
old
manservant
,
who
met
us
in
the
*NL*
passage
.
There
was
no
light
save
in
the
dining-room
,
but
Holmes
caught
*NL*
up
the
lamp
and
left
no
corner
of
the
house
unexplored
.
No
sign
could
we
*NL*
see
of
the
man
whom
we
were
chasing
.
On
the
upper
floor
,
however
,
one
of
*NL*
the
bedroom
doors
was
locked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
someone
in
here
,
''
cried
Lestrade
.
``
I
can
hear
a
movement
.
Open
*NL*
this
door
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
faint
moaning
and
rustling
came
from
within
.
Holmes
struck
the
door
*NL*
just
over
the
lock
with
the
flat
of
his
foot
and
it
flew
open
.
Pistol
in
*NL*
hand
,
we
all
three
rushed
into
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
was
no
sign
within
it
of
that
desperate
and
defiant
villain
*NL*
whom
we
expected
to
see
.
Instead
we
were
faced
by
an
object
so
strange
*NL*
and
so
unexpected
that
we
stood
for
a
moment
staring
at
it
in
amazement
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
room
had
been
fashioned
into
a
small
museum
,
and
the
walls
were
*NL*
lined
by
a
number
of
glass-topped
cases
full
of
that
collection
of
*NL*
butterflies
and
moths
the
formation
of
which
had
been
the
relaxation
of
*NL*
this
complex
and
dangerous
man
.
In
the
centre
of
this
room
there
was
an
*NL*
upright
beam
,
which
had
been
placed
at
some
period
as
a
support
for
the
*NL*
old
worm-eaten
baulk
of
timber
which
spanned
the
roof
.
To
this
post
a
*NL*
figure
was
tied
,
so
swathed
and
muffled
in
the
sheets
which
had
been
*NL*
used
to
secure
it
that
one
could
not
for
the
moment
tell
whether
it
*NL*
was
that
of
a
man
or
a
woman
.
One
towel
passed
round
the
throat
and
was
*NL*
secured
at
the
back
of
the
pillar
.
Another
covered
the
lower
part
of
*NL*
the
face
,
and
over
it
two
dark
eyes
--
eyes
full
of
grief
and
shame
and
a
*NL*
dreadful
questioning
--
stared
back
at
us
.
In
a
minute
we
had
torn
off
*NL*
the
gag
,
unswathed
the
bonds
,
and
Mrs.
Stapleton
sank
upon
the
floor
in
*NL*
front
of
us
.
As
her
beautiful
head
fell
upon
her
chest
I
saw
the
clear
*NL*
red
weal
of
a
whiplash
across
her
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
brute
!
''
cried
Holmes
.
``
Here
,
Lestrade
,
your
brandy-bottle
!
Put
her
*NL*
in
the
chair
!
She
has
fainted
from
ill-usage
and
exhaustion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
opened
her
eyes
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
safe
?
''
she
asked
.
``
Has
he
escaped
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
can
not
escape
us
,
madam
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
I
did
not
mean
my
husband
.
Sir
Henry
?
Is
he
safe
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
hound
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
dead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
gave
a
long
sigh
of
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
God
!
Thank
God
!
Oh
,
this
villain
!
See
how
he
has
treated
me
!
''
*NL*
She
shot
her
arms
out
from
her
sleeves
,
and
we
saw
with
horror
that
they
*NL*
were
all
mottled
with
bruises
.
``
But
this
is
nothing
--
nothing
!
It
is
my
*NL*
mind
and
soul
that
he
has
tortured
and
defiled
.
I
could
endure
it
all
,
*NL*
ill-usage
,
solitude
,
a
life
of
deception
,
everything
,
as
long
as
I
could
*NL*
still
cling
to
the
hope
that
I
had
his
love
,
but
now
I
know
that
in
*NL*
this
also
I
have
been
his
dupe
and
his
tool
.
''
She
broke
into
passionate
*NL*
sobbing
as
she
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
bear
him
no
good
will
,
madam
,
''
said
Holmes
.
``
Tell
us
then
where
we
*NL*
shall
find
him
.
If
you
have
ever
aided
him
in
evil
,
help
us
now
and
so
*NL*
atone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
but
one
place
where
he
can
have
fled
,
''
she
answered
.
``
There
is
*NL*
an
old
tin
mine
on
an
island
in
the
heart
of
the
mire
.
It
was
there
that
*NL*
he
kept
his
hound
and
there
also
he
had
made
preparations
so
that
he
*NL*
might
have
a
refuge
.
That
is
where
he
would
fly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
fog-bank
lay
like
white
wool
against
the
window
.
Holmes
held
the
*NL*
lamp
towards
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
,
''
said
he
.
``
No
one
could
find
his
way
into
the
Grimpen
Mire
*NL*
tonight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
laughed
and
clapped
her
hands
.
Her
eyes
and
teeth
gleamed
with
*NL*
fierce
merriment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
may
find
his
way
in
,
but
never
out
,
''
she
cried
.
``
How
can
he
see
the
*NL*
guiding
wands
tonight
?
We
planted
them
together
,
he
and
I
,
to
mark
the
*NL*
pathway
through
the
mire
.
Oh
,
if
I
could
only
have
plucked
them
out
*NL*
today
.
Then
indeed
you
would
have
had
him
at
your
mercy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
evident
to
us
that
all
pursuit
was
in
vain
until
the
fog
had
*NL*
lifted
.
Meanwhile
we
left
Lestrade
in
possession
of
the
house
while
*NL*
Holmes
and
I
went
back
with
the
baronet
to
Baskerville
Hall
.
The
story
*NL*
of
the
Stapletons
could
no
longer
be
withheld
from
him
,
but
he
took
*NL*
the
blow
bravely
when
he
learned
the
truth
about
the
woman
whom
he
had
*NL*
loved
.
But
the
shock
of
the
night
's
adventures
had
shattered
his
nerves
,
*NL*
and
before
morning
he
lay
delirious
in
a
high
fever
under
the
care
of
*NL*
Dr.
Mortimer
.
The
two
of
them
were
destined
to
travel
together
round
the
*NL*
world
before
Sir
Henry
had
become
once
more
the
hale
,
hearty
man
that
he
*NL*
had
been
before
he
became
master
of
that
ill-omened
estate
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
I
come
rapidly
to
the
conclusion
of
this
singular
narrative
,
in
*NL*
which
I
have
tried
to
make
the
reader
share
those
dark
fears
and
vague
*NL*
surmises
which
clouded
our
lives
so
long
and
ended
in
so
tragic
a
*NL*
manner
.
On
the
morning
after
the
death
of
the
hound
the
fog
had
lifted
*NL*
and
we
were
guided
by
Mrs.
Stapleton
to
the
point
where
they
had
found
*NL*
a
pathway
through
the
bog
.
It
helped
us
to
realize
the
horror
of
this
*NL*
woman
's
life
when
we
saw
the
eagerness
and
joy
with
which
she
laid
us
*NL*
on
her
husband
's
track
.
We
left
her
standing
upon
the
thin
peninsula
of
*NL*
firm
,
peaty
soil
which
tapered
out
into
the
widespread
bog
.
From
the
*NL*
end
of
it
a
small
wand
planted
here
and
there
showed
where
the
path
*NL*
zigzagged
from
tuft
to
tuft
of
rushes
among
those
green-scummed
pits
*NL*
and
foul
quagmires
which
barred
the
way
to
the
stranger
.
Rank
reeds
and
*NL*
lush
,
slimy
water-plants
sent
an
odour
of
decay
and
a
heavy
miasmatic
*NL*
vapour
onto
our
faces
,
while
a
false
step
plunged
us
more
than
once
*NL*
thigh-deep
into
the
dark
,
quivering
mire
,
which
shook
for
yards
in
soft
*NL*
undulations
around
our
feet
.
Its
tenacious
grip
plucked
at
our
heels
as
*NL*
we
walked
,
and
when
we
sank
into
it
it
was
as
if
some
malignant
hand
was
*NL*
tugging
us
down
into
those
obscene
depths
,
so
grim
and
purposeful
was
*NL*
the
clutch
in
which
it
held
us
.
Once
only
we
saw
a
trace
that
someone
*NL*
had
passed
that
perilous
way
before
us
.
From
amid
a
tuft
of
cotton
grass
*NL*
which
bore
it
up
out
of
the
slime
some
dark
thing
was
projecting
.
Holmes
*NL*
sank
to
his
waist
as
he
stepped
from
the
path
to
seize
it
,
and
had
we
*NL*
not
been
there
to
drag
him
out
he
could
never
have
set
his
foot
*NL*
upon

He
held
an
old
black
boot
in
the
air

printed
on
the

It

He
retained
it
in
his
hand
after
using
it
to
set
the
hound
*NL*
upon
the
track
.
He
fled
when
he
knew
the
game
was
up
,
still
clutching
*NL*
it
.
And
he
hurled
it
away
at
this
point
of
his
flight
.
We
know
at
least
*NL*
that
he
came
so
far
in
safety
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
more
than
that
we
were
never
destined
to
know
,
though
there
was
much
*NL*
which
we
might
surmise
.
There
was
no
chance
of
finding
footsteps
in
the
*NL*
mire
,
for
the
rising
mud
oozed
swiftly
in
upon
them
,
but
as
we
at
last
*NL*
reached
firmer
ground
beyond
the
morass
we
all
looked
eagerly
for
them
.
*NL*
But
no
slightest
sign
of
them
ever
met
our
eyes
.
If
the
earth
told
a
*NL*
true
story
,
then
Stapleton
never
reached
that
island
of
refuge
towards
*NL*
which
he
struggled
through
the
fog
upon
that
last
night
.
Somewhere
in
*NL*
the
heart
of
the
great
Grimpen
Mire
,
down
in
the
foul
slime
of
the
*NL*
huge
morass
which
had
sucked
him
in
,
this
cold
and
cruel-hearted
man
is
*NL*
forever
buried
.
*NL*
*NL*
Many
traces
we
found
of
him
in
the
bog-girt
island
where
he
had
hid
his
*NL*
savage
ally
.
A
huge
driving-wheel
and
a
shaft
half-filled
with
rubbish
*NL*
showed
the
position
of
an
abandoned
mine
.
Beside
it
were
the
crumbling
*NL*
remains
of
the
cottages
of
the
miners
,
driven
away
no
doubt
by
the
foul
*NL*
reek
of
the
surrounding
swamp
.
In
one
of
these
a
staple
and
chain
with
*NL*
a
quantity
of
gnawed
bones
showed
where
the
animal
had
been
confined
.
*NL*
A
skeleton
with
a
tangle
of
brown
hair
adhering
to
it
lay
among
the
*NL*
debris
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
dog
!
''
said
Holmes
.
``
By
Jove
,
a
curly-haired
spaniel
.
Poor
Mortimer
*NL*
will
never
see
his
pet
again
.
Well
,
I
do
not
know
that
this
place
*NL*
contains
any
secret
which
we
have
not
already
fathomed
.
He
could
hide
*NL*
his
hound
,
but
he
could
not
hush
its
voice
,
and
hence
came
those
cries
*NL*
which
even
in
daylight
were
not
pleasant
to
hear
.
On
an
emergency
he
*NL*
could
keep
the
hound
in
the
out-house
at
Merripit
,
but
it
was
always
a
*NL*
risk
,
and
it
was
only
on
the
supreme
day
,
which
he
regarded
as
the
end
*NL*
of
all
his
efforts
,
that
he
dared
do
it
.
This
paste
in
the
tin
is
no
*NL*
doubt
the
luminous
mixture
with
which
the
creature
was
daubed
.
It
was
*NL*
suggested
,
of
course
,
by
the
story
of
the
family
hell-hound
,
and
by
the
*NL*
desire
to
frighten
old
Sir
Charles
to
death
.
No
wonder
the
poor
devil
of
*NL*
a
convict
ran
and
screamed
,
even
as
our
friend
did
,
and
as
we
ourselves
*NL*
might
have
done
,
when
he
saw
such
a
creature
bounding
through
the
*NL*
darkness
of
the
moor
upon
his
track
.
It
was
a
cunning
device
,
for
,
apart
*NL*
from
the
chance
of
driving
your
victim
to
his
death
,
what
peasant
would
*NL*
venture
to
inquire
too
closely
into
such
a
creature
should
he
get
sight
*NL*
of
it
,
as
many
have
done
,
upon
the
moor
?
I
said
it
in
London
,
Watson
,
*NL*
and
I
say
it
again
now
,
that
never
yet
have
we
helped
to
hunt
down
a
*NL*
more
dangerous
man
than
he
who
is
lying
yonder
''
--
he
swept
his
long
arm
*NL*
towards
the
huge
mottled
expanse
of
green-splotched
bog
which
stretched
*NL*
away
until
it
merged
into
the
russet
slopes
of
the
moor

A
Retrospection
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
end
of
November
,
and
Holmes
and
I
sat
,
upon
a
raw
and
foggy
*NL*
night
,
on
either
side
of
a
blazing
fire
in
our
sitting-room
in
Baker
*NL*
Street
.
Since
the
tragic
upshot
of
our
visit
to
Devonshire
he
had
been
*NL*
engaged
in
two
affairs
of
the
utmost
importance
,
in
the
first
of
which
*NL*
he
had
exposed
the
atrocious
conduct
of
Colonel
Upwood
in
connection
*NL*
with
the
famous
card
scandal
of
the
Nonpareil
Club
,
while
in
the
second
*NL*
he
had
defended
the
unfortunate
Mme.
Montpensier
from
the
charge
*NL*
of
murder
which
hung
over
her
in
connection
with
the
death
of
her
*NL*
step-daughter
,
Mlle.
Carere
,
the
young
lady
who
,
as
it
will
be
*NL*
remembered
,
was
found
six
months
later
alive
and
married
in
New
York
.
*NL*
My
friend
was
in
excellent
spirits
over
the
success
which
had
attended
*NL*
a
succession
of
difficult
and
important
cases
,
so
that
I
was
able
to
*NL*
induce
him
to
discuss
the
details
of
the
Baskerville
mystery
.
I
had
*NL*
waited
patiently
for
the
opportunity
for
I
was
aware
that
he
would
never
*NL*
permit
cases
to
overlap
,
and
that
his
clear
and
logical
mind
would
not
*NL*
be
drawn
from
its
present
work
to
dwell
upon
memories
of
the
past
.
Sir
*NL*
Henry
and
Dr.
Mortimer
were
,
however
,
in
London
,
on
their
way
to
that
*NL*
long
voyage
which
had
been
recommended
for
the
restoration
of
his
*NL*
shattered
nerves
.
They
had
called
upon
us
that
very
afternoon
,
so
that
*NL*
it
was
natural
that
the
subject
should
come
up
for
discussion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
whole
course
of
events
,
''
said
Holmes
,
``
from
the
point
of
view
of
*NL*
the
man
who
called
himself
Stapleton
was
simple
and
direct
,
although
*NL*
to
us
,
who
had
no
means
in
the
beginning
of
knowing
the
motives
of
*NL*
his
actions
and
could
only
learn
part
of
the
facts
,
it
all
appeared
*NL*
exceedingly
complex
.
I
have
had
the
advantage
of
two
conversations
with
*NL*
Mrs.
Stapleton
,
and
the
case
has
now
been
so
entirely
cleared
up
that
I
*NL*
am
not
aware
that
there
is
anything
which
has
remained
a
secret
to
us
.
*NL*
You
will
find
a
few
notes
upon
the
matter
under
the
heading
B
in
my
*NL*
indexed
list
of
cases
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
you
would
kindly
give
me
a
sketch
of
the
course
of
events
from
*NL*
memory
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
though
I
can
not
guarantee
that
I
carry
all
the
facts
in
my
*NL*
mind
.
Intense
mental
concentration
has
a
curious
way
of
blotting
out
*NL*
what
has
passed
.
The
barrister
who
has
his
case
at
his
fingers
'
ends
and
*NL*
is
able
to
argue
with
an
expert
upon
his
own
subject
finds
that
a
week
*NL*
or
two
of
the
courts
will
drive
it
all
out
of
his
head
once
more
.
So
*NL*
each
of
my
cases
displaces
the
last
,
and
Mlle.
Carere
has
blurred
my
*NL*
recollection
of
Baskerville
Hall
.
Tomorrow
some
other
little
problem
may
*NL*
be
submitted
to
my
notice
which
will
in
turn
dispossess
the
fair
French
*NL*
lady
and
the
infamous
Upwood
.
So
far
as
the
case
of
the
hound
goes
,
*NL*
however
,
I
will
give
you
the
course
of
events
as
nearly
as
I
can
,
and
*NL*
you
will
suggest
anything
which
I
may
have
forgotten
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
inquiries
show
beyond
all
question
that
the
family
portrait
did
not
*NL*
lie
,
and
that
this
fellow
was
indeed
a
Baskerville
.
He
was
a
son
of
that
*NL*
Rodger
Baskerville
,
the
younger
brother
of
Sir
Charles
,
who
fled
with
*NL*
a
sinister
reputation
to
South
America
,
where
he
was
said
to
have
died
*NL*
unmarried
.
He
did
,
as
a
matter
of
fact
,
marry
,
and
had
one
child
,
this
*NL*
fellow
,
whose
real
name
is
the
same
as
his
father
's
.
He
married
Beryl
*NL*
Garcia
,
one
of
the
beauties
of
Costa
Rica
,
and
,
having
purloined
a
*NL*
considerable
sum
of
public
money
,
he
changed
his
name
to
Vandeleur
and
*NL*
fled
to
England
,
where
he
established
a
school
in
the
east
of
Yorkshire
.
*NL*
His
reason
for
attempting
this
special
line
of
business
was
that
he
had
*NL*
struck
up
an
acquaintance
with
a
consumptive
tutor
upon
the
voyage
*NL*
home
,
and
that
he
had
used
this
man
's
ability
to
make
the
undertaking
a
*NL*
success
.
Fraser
,
the
tutor
,
died
however
,
and
the
school
which
had
begun
*NL*
well
sank
from
disrepute
into
infamy
.
The
Vandeleurs
found
it
convenient
*NL*
to
change
their
name
to
Stapleton
,
and
he
brought
the
remains
of
his
*NL*
fortune
,
his
schemes
for
the
future
,
and
his
taste
for
entomology
to
*NL*
the
south
of
England
.
I
learned
at
the
British
Museum
that
he
was
a
*NL*
recognized
authority
upon
the
subject
,
and
that
the
name
of
Vandeleur
*NL*
has
been
permanently
attached
to
a
certain
moth
which
he
had
,
in
his
*NL*
Yorkshire
days
,
been
the
first
to
describe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
now
come
to
that
portion
of
his
life
which
has
proved
to
be
of
such
*NL*
intense
interest
to
us
.
The
fellow
had
evidently
made
inquiry
and
found
*NL*
that
only
two
lives
intervened
between
him
and
a
valuable
estate
.
When
*NL*
he
went
to
Devonshire
his
plans
were
,
I
believe
,
exceedingly
hazy
,
but
*NL*
that
he
meant
mischief
from
the
first
is
evident
from
the
way
in
which
*NL*
he
took
his
wife
with
him
in
the
character
of
his
sister
.
The
idea
of
*NL*
using
her
as
a
decoy
was
clearly
already
in
his
mind
,
though
he
may
not
*NL*
have
been
certain
how
the
details
of
his
plot
were
to
be
arranged
.
He
*NL*
meant
in
the
end
to
have
the
estate
,
and
he
was
ready
to
use
any
tool
*NL*
or
run
any
risk
for
that
end
.
His
first
act
was
to
establish
himself
as
*NL*
near
to
his
ancestral
home
as
he
could
,
and
his
second
was
to
cultivate
*NL*
a
friendship
with
Sir
Charles
Baskerville
and
with
the
neighbours
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
baronet
himself
told
him
about
the
family
hound
,
and
so
prepared
*NL*
the
way
for
his
own
death
.
Stapleton
,
as
I
will
continue
to
call
him
,
*NL*
knew
that
the
old
man
's
heart
was
weak
and
that
a
shock
would
kill
him
.
*NL*
So
much
he
had
learned
from
Dr.
Mortimer
.
He
had
heard
also
that
Sir
*NL*
Charles
was
superstitious
and
had
taken
this
grim
legend
very
seriously
.
*NL*
His
ingenious
mind
instantly
suggested
a
way
by
which
the
baronet
could
*NL*
be
done
to
death
,
and
yet
it
would
be
hardly
possible
to
bring
home
the
*NL*
guilt
to
the
real
murderer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Having
conceived
the
idea
he
proceeded
to
carry
it
out
with
*NL*
considerable
finesse
.
An
ordinary
schemer
would
have
been
content
*NL*
to
work
with
a
savage
hound
.
The
use
of
artificial
means
to
make
the
*NL*
creature
diabolical
was
a
flash
of
genius
upon
his
part
.
The
dog
he
*NL*
bought
in
London
from
Ross
and
Mangles
,
the
dealers
in
Fulham
Road
.
It
*NL*
was
the
strongest
and
most
savage
in
their
possession
.
He
brought
it
*NL*
down
by
the
North
Devon
line
and
walked
a
great
distance
over
the
moor
*NL*
so
as
to
get
it
home
without
exciting
any
remarks
.
He
had
already
on
his
*NL*
insect
hunts
learned
to
penetrate
the
Grimpen
Mire
,
and
so
had
found
a
*NL*
safe
hiding-place
for
the
creature
.
Here
he
kennelled
it
and
waited
his
*NL*
chance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
was
some
time
coming
.
The
old
gentleman
could
not
be
decoyed
*NL*
outside
of
his
grounds
at
night
.
Several
times
Stapleton
lurked
about
*NL*
with
his
hound
,
but
without
avail
.
It
was
during
these
fruitless
quests
*NL*
that
he
,
or
rather
his
ally
,
was
seen
by
peasants
,
and
that
the
legend
*NL*
of
the
demon
dog
received
a
new
confirmation
.
He
had
hoped
that
his
wife
*NL*
might
lure
Sir
Charles
to
his
ruin
,
but
here
she
proved
unexpectedly
*NL*
independent
.
She
would
not
endeavour
to
entangle
the
old
gentleman
in
*NL*
a
sentimental
attachment
which
might
deliver
him
over
to
his
enemy
.
*NL*
Threats
and
even
,
I
am
sorry
to
say
,
blows
refused
to
move
her
.
She
*NL*
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
,
and
for
a
time
Stapleton
was
at
a
*NL*
deadlock
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
found
a
way
out
of
his
difficulties
through
the
chance
that
Sir
*NL*
Charles
,
who
had
conceived
a
friendship
for
him
,
made
him
the
minister
*NL*
of
his
charity
in
the
case
of
this
unfortunate
woman
,
Mrs.
Laura
Lyons
.
*NL*
By
representing
himself
as
a
single
man
he
acquired
complete
influence
*NL*
over
her
,
and
he
gave
her
to
understand
that
in
the
event
of
her
*NL*
obtaining
a
divorce
from
her
husband
he
would
marry
her
.
His
plans
were
*NL*
suddenly
brought
to
a
head
by
his
knowledge
that
Sir
Charles
was
about
*NL*
to
leave
the
Hall
on
the
advice
of
Dr.
Mortimer
,
with
whose
opinion
he
*NL*
himself
pretended
to
coincide
.
He
must
act
at
once
,
or
his
victim
might
*NL*
get
beyond
his
power
.
He
therefore
put
pressure
upon
Mrs.
Lyons
to
*NL*
write
this
letter
,
imploring
the
old
man
to
give
her
an
interview
on
*NL*
the
evening
before
his
departure
for
London
.
He
then
,
by
a
specious
*NL*
argument
,
prevented
her
from
going
,
and
so
had
the
chance
for
which
he
*NL*
had
waited
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Driving
back
in
the
evening
from
Coombe
Tracey
he
was
in
time
to
get
*NL*
his
hound
,
to
treat
it
with
his
infernal
paint
,
and
to
bring
the
beast
*NL*
round
to
the
gate
at
which
he
had
reason
to
expect
that
he
would
find
*NL*
the
old
gentleman
waiting
.
The
dog
,
incited
by
its
master
,
sprang
over
*NL*
the
wicket-gate
and
pursued
the
unfortunate
baronet
,
who
fled
screaming
*NL*
down
the
yew
alley
.
In
that
gloomy
tunnel
it
must
indeed
have
been
a
*NL*
dreadful
sight
to
see
that
huge
black
creature
,
with
its
flaming
jaws
*NL*
and
blazing
eyes
,
bounding
after
its
victim
.
He
fell
dead
at
the
end
*NL*
of
the
alley
from
heart
disease
and
terror
.
The
hound
had
kept
upon
the
*NL*
grassy
border
while
the
baronet
had
run
down
the
path
,
so
that
no
track
*NL*
but
the
man
's
was
visible
.
On
seeing
him
lying
still
the
creature
had
*NL*
probably
approached
to
sniff
at
him
,
but
finding
him
dead
had
turned
*NL*
away
again
.
It
was
then
that
it
left
the
print
which
was
actually
*NL*
observed
by
Dr.
Mortimer
.
The
hound
was
called
off
and
hurried
away
to
*NL*
its
lair
in
the
Grimpen
Mire
,
and
a
mystery
was
left
which
puzzled
*NL*
the
authorities
,
alarmed
the
countryside
,
and
finally
brought
the
case
*NL*
within
the
scope
of
our
observation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
much
for
the
death
of
Sir
Charles
Baskerville
.
You
perceive
the
*NL*
devilish
cunning
of
it
,
for
really
it
would
be
almost
impossible
to
make
*NL*
a
case
against
the
real
murderer
.
His
only
accomplice
was
one
who
could
*NL*
never
give
him
away
,
and
the
grotesque
,
inconceivable
nature
of
*NL*
the
device
only
served
to
make
it
more
effective
.
Both
of
the
women
*NL*
concerned
in
the
case
,
Mrs.
Stapleton
and
Mrs.
Laura
Lyons
,
were
left
*NL*
with
a
strong
suspicion
against
Stapleton
.
Mrs.
Stapleton
knew
that
he
*NL*
had
designs
upon
the
old
man
,
and
also
of
the
existence
of
the
hound
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Lyons
knew
neither
of
these
things
,
but
had
been
impressed
by
the
*NL*
death
occurring
at
the
time
of
an
uncancelled
appointment
which
was
only
*NL*
known
to
him
.
However
,
both
of
them
were
under
his
influence
,
and
he
had
*NL*
nothing
to
fear
from
them
.
The
first
half
of
his
task
was
successfully
*NL*
accomplished
but
the
more
difficult
still
remained
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
possible
that
Stapleton
did
not
know
of
the
existence
of
an
heir
*NL*
in
Canada
.
In
any
case
he
would
very
soon
learn
it
from
his
friend
Dr.
*NL*
Mortimer
,
and
he
was
told
by
the
latter
all
details
about
the
arrival
of
*NL*
Henry
Baskerville
.
Stapleton
's
first
idea
was
that
this
young
stranger
*NL*
from
Canada
might
possibly
be
done
to
death
in
London
without
coming
*NL*
down
to
Devonshire
at
all
.
He
distrusted
his
wife
ever
since
she
had
*NL*
refused
to
help
him
in
laying
a
trap
for
the
old
man
,
and
he
dared
not
*NL*
leave
her
long
out
of
his
sight
for
fear
he
should
lose
his
influence
*NL*
over
her
.
It
was
for
this
reason
that
he
took
her
to
London
with
him
.
*NL*
They
lodged
,
I
find
,
at
the
Mexborough
Private
Hotel
,
in
Craven
Street
,
*NL*
which
was
actually
one
of
those
called
upon
by
my
agent
in
search
*NL*
of
evidence
.
Here
he
kept
his
wife
imprisoned
in
her
room
while
*NL*
he
,
disguised
in
a
beard
,
followed
Dr.
Mortimer
to
Baker
Street
and
*NL*
afterwards
to
the
station
and
to
the
Northumberland
Hotel
.
His
wife
had
*NL*
some
inkling
of
his
plans
;
but
she
had
such
a
fear
of
her
husband
--
a
*NL*
fear
founded
upon
brutal
ill-treatment
--
that
she
dare
not
write
to
warn
*NL*
the
man
whom
she
knew
to
be
in
danger
.
If
the
letter
should
fall
into
*NL*
Stapleton
's
hands
her
own
life
would
not
be
safe
.
Eventually
,
as
we
*NL*
know
,
she
adopted
the
expedient
of
cutting
out
the
words
which
would
*NL*
form
the
message
,
and
addressing
the
letter
in
a
disguised
hand
.
It
*NL*
reached
the
baronet
,
and
gave
him
the
first
warning
of
his
danger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
very
essential
for
Stapleton
to
get
some
article
of
Sir
Henry
's
*NL*
attire
so
that
,
in
case
he
was
driven
to
use
the
dog
,
he
might
always
*NL*
have
the
means
of
setting
him
upon
his
track
.
With
characteristic
*NL*
promptness
and
audacity
he
set
about
this
at
once
,
and
we
can
not
doubt
*NL*
that
the
boots
or
chamber-maid
of
the
hotel
was
well
bribed
to
help
him
*NL*
in
his
design
.
By
chance
,
however
,
the
first
boot
which
was
procured
for
*NL*
him
was
a
new
one
and
,
therefore
,
useless
for
his
purpose
.
He
then
had
*NL*
it
returned
and
obtained
another
--
a
most
instructive
incident
,
since
it
*NL*
proved
conclusively
to
my
mind
that
we
were
dealing
with
a
real
hound
,
*NL*
as
no
other
supposition
could
explain
this
anxiety
to
obtain
an
old
*NL*
boot
and
this
indifference
to
a
new
one
.
The
more
outre
and
grotesque
an
*NL*
incident
is
the
more
carefully
it
deserves
to
be
examined
,
and
the
very
*NL*
point
which
appears
to
complicate
a
case
is
,
when
duly
considered
and
*NL*
scientifically
handled
,
the
one
which
is
most
likely
to
elucidate
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
we
had
the
visit
from
our
friends
next
morning
,
shadowed
always
*NL*
by
Stapleton
in
the
cab
.
From
his
knowledge
of
our
rooms
and
of
my
*NL*
appearance
,
as
well
as
from
his
general
conduct
,
I
am
inclined
to
think
*NL*
that
Stapleton
's
career
of
crime
has
been
by
no
means
limited
to
this
*NL*
single
Baskerville
affair
.
It
is
suggestive
that
during
the
last
three
*NL*
years
there
have
been
four
considerable
burglaries
in
the
west
country
,
*NL*
for
none
of
which
was
any
criminal
ever
arrested
.
The
last
of
these
,
at
*NL*
Folkestone
Court
,
in
May
,
was
remarkable
for
the
cold-blooded
pistolling
*NL*
of
the
page
,
who
surprised
the
masked
and
solitary
burglar
.
I
can
not
*NL*
doubt
that
Stapleton
recruited
his
waning
resources
in
this
fashion
,
and
*NL*
that
for
years
he
has
been
a
desperate
and
dangerous
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
had
an
example
of
his
readiness
of
resource
that
morning
when
he
got
*NL*
away
from
us
so
successfully
,
and
also
of
his
audacity
in
sending
back
*NL*
my
own
name
to
me
through
the
cabman
.
From
that
moment
he
understood
*NL*
that
I
had
taken
over
the
case
in
London
,
and
that
therefore
there
was
*NL*
no
chance
for
him
there
.
He
returned
to
Dartmoor
and
awaited
the
arrival
*NL*
of
the
baronet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
moment
!
''
said
I.
``
You
have
,
no
doubt
,
described
the
sequence
*NL*
of
events
correctly
,
but
there
is
one
point
which
you
have
left
*NL*
unexplained
.
What
became
of
the
hound
when
its
master
was
in
London
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
given
some
attention
to
this
matter
and
it
is
undoubtedly
of
*NL*
importance
.
There
can
be
no
question
that
Stapleton
had
a
confidant
,
*NL*
though
it
is
unlikely
that
he
ever
placed
himself
in
his
power
by
*NL*
sharing
all
his
plans
with
him
.
There
was
an
old
manservant
at
Merripit
*NL*
House
,
whose
name
was
Anthony
.
His
connection
with
the
Stapletons
can
*NL*
be
traced
for
several
years
,
as
far
back
as
the
school-mastering
days
,
*NL*
so
that
he
must
have
been
aware
that
his
master
and
mistress
were
really
*NL*
husband
and
wife
.
This
man
has
disappeared
and
has
escaped
from
the
*NL*
country
.
It
is
suggestive
that
Anthony
is
not
a
common
name
in
England
,
*NL*
while
Antonio
is
so
in
all
Spanish
or
Spanish-American
countries
.
The
*NL*
man
,
like
Mrs.
Stapleton
herself
,
spoke
good
English
,
but
with
a
curious
*NL*
lisping
accent
.
I
have
myself
seen
this
old
man
cross
the
Grimpen
*NL*
Mire
by
the
path
which
Stapleton
had
marked
out
.
It
is
very
probable
,
*NL*
therefore
,
that
in
the
absence
of
his
master
it
was
he
who
cared
for
the
*NL*
hound
,
though
he
may
never
have
known
the
purpose
for
which
the
beast
*NL*
was
used
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Stapletons
then
went
down
to
Devonshire
,
whither
they
were
soon
*NL*
followed
by
Sir
Henry
and
you
.
One
word
now
as
to
how
I
stood
myself
at
*NL*
that
time
.
It
may
possibly
recur
to
your
memory
that
when
I
examined
*NL*
the
paper
upon
which
the
printed
words
were
fastened
I
made
a
close
*NL*
inspection
for
the
water-mark
.
In
doing
so
I
held
it
within
a
few
inches
*NL*
of
my
eyes
,
and
was
conscious
of
a
faint
smell
of
the
scent
known
as
*NL*
white
jessamine
.
There
are
seventy-five
perfumes
,
which
it
is
very
*NL*
necessary
that
a
criminal
expert
should
be
able
to
distinguish
from
each
*NL*
other
,
and
cases
have
more
than
once
within
my
own
experience
depended
*NL*
upon
their
prompt
recognition
.
The
scent
suggested
the
presence
of
a
*NL*
lady
,
and
already
my
thoughts
began
to
turn
towards
the
Stapletons
.
Thus
*NL*
I
had
made
certain
of
the
hound
,
and
had
guessed
at
the
criminal
before
*NL*
ever
we
went
to
the
west
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
my
game
to
watch
Stapleton
.
It
was
evident
,
however
,
that
I
*NL*
could
not
do
this
if
I
were
with
you
,
since
he
would
be
keenly
on
his
*NL*
guard
.
I
deceived
everybody
,
therefore
,
yourself
included
,
and
I
came
*NL*
down
secretly
when
I
was
supposed
to
be
in
London
.
My
hardships
were
*NL*
not
so
great
as
you
imagined
,
though
such
trifling
details
must
never
*NL*
interfere
with
the
investigation
of
a
case
.
I
stayed
for
the
most
*NL*
part
at
Coombe
Tracey
,
and
only
used
the
hut
upon
the
moor
when
it
was
*NL*
necessary
to
be
near
the
scene
of
action
.
Cartwright
had
come
down
with
*NL*
me
,
and
in
his
disguise
as
a
country
boy
he
was
of
great
assistance
*NL*
to
me
.
I
was
dependent
upon
him
for
food
and
clean
linen
.
When
I
was
*NL*
watching
Stapleton
,
Cartwright
was
frequently
watching
you
,
so
that
I
*NL*
was
able
to
keep
my
hand
upon
all
the
strings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
already
told
you
that
your
reports
reached
me
rapidly
,
being
*NL*
forwarded
instantly
from
Baker
Street
to
Coombe
Tracey
.
They
were
of
*NL*
great
service
to
me
,
and
especially
that
one
incidentally
truthful
piece
*NL*
of
biography
of
Stapleton
's
.
I
was
able
to
establish
the
identity
of
*NL*
the
man
and
the
woman
and
knew
at
last
exactly
how
I
stood
.
The
case
*NL*
had
been
considerably
complicated
through
the
incident
of
the
escaped
*NL*
convict
and
the
relations
between
him
and
the
Barrymores
.
This
also
you
*NL*
cleared
up
in
a
very
effective
way
,
though
I
had
already
come
to
the
*NL*
same
conclusions
from
my
own
observations
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
time
that
you
discovered
me
upon
the
moor
I
had
a
complete
*NL*
knowledge
of
the
whole
business
,
but
I
had
not
a
case
which
could
go
to
*NL*
a
jury
.
Even
Stapleton
's
attempt
upon
Sir
Henry
that
night
which
ended
*NL*
in
the
death
of
the
unfortunate
convict
did
not
help
us
much
in
proving
*NL*
murder
against
our
man
.
There
seemed
to
be
no
alternative
but
to
*NL*
catch
him
red-handed
,
and
to
do
so
we
had
to
use
Sir
Henry
,
alone
and
*NL*
apparently
unprotected
,
as
a
bait
.
We
did
so
,
and
at
the
cost
of
a
*NL*
severe
shock
to
our
client
we
succeeded
in
completing
our
case
and
*NL*
driving
Stapleton
to
his
destruction
.
That
Sir
Henry
should
have
been
*NL*
exposed
to
this
is
,
I
must
confess
,
a
reproach
to
my
management
of
the
*NL*
case
,
but
we
had
no
means
of
foreseeing
the
terrible
and
paralyzing
*NL*
spectacle
which
the
beast
presented
,
nor
could
we
predict
the
fog
which
*NL*
enabled
him
to
burst
upon
us
at
such
short
notice
.
We
succeeded
in
our
*NL*
object
at
a
cost
which
both
the
specialist
and
Dr.
Mortimer
assure
me
*NL*
will
be
a
temporary
one
.
A
long
journey
may
enable
our
friend
to
recover
*NL*
not
only
from
his
shattered
nerves
but
also
from
his
wounded
feelings
.
*NL*
His
love
for
the
lady
was
deep
and
sincere
,
and
to
him
the
saddest
part
*NL*
of
all
this
black
business
was
that
he
should
have
been
deceived
by
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
only
remains
to
indicate
the
part
which
she
had
played
throughout
.
*NL*
There
can
be
no
doubt
that
Stapleton
exercised
an
influence
over
her
*NL*
which
may
have
been
love
or
may
have
been
fear
,
or
very
possibly
both
,
*NL*
since
they
are
by
no
means
incompatible
emotions
.
It
was
,
at
least
,
*NL*
absolutely
effective
.
At
his
command
she
consented
to
pass
as
his
*NL*
sister
,
though
he
found
the
limits
of
his
power
over
her
when
he
*NL*
endeavoured
to
make
her
the
direct
accessory
to
murder
.
She
was
ready
to
*NL*
warn
Sir
Henry
so
far
as
she
could
without
implicating
her
husband
,
and
*NL*
again
and
again
she
tried
to
do
so
.
Stapleton
himself
seems
to
have
been
*NL*
capable
of
jealousy
,
and
when
he
saw
the
baronet
paying
court
to
the
*NL*
lady
,
even
though
it
was
part
of
his
own
plan
,
still
he
could
not
help
*NL*
interrupting
with
a
passionate
outburst
which
revealed
the
fiery
soul
*NL*
which
his
self-contained
manner
so
cleverly
concealed
.
By
encouraging
*NL*
the
intimacy
he
made
it
certain
that
Sir
Henry
would
frequently
come
*NL*
to
Merripit
House
and
that
he
would
sooner
or
later
get
the
opportunity
*NL*
which
he
desired
.
On
the
day
of
the
crisis
,
however
,
his
wife
turned
*NL*
suddenly
against
him
.
She
had
learned
something
of
the
death
of
the
*NL*
convict
,
and
she
knew
that
the
hound
was
being
kept
in
the
outhouse
on
*NL*
the
evening
that
Sir
Henry
was
coming
to
dinner
.
She
taxed
her
husband
*NL*
with
his
intended
crime
,
and
a
furious
scene
followed
in
which
he
showed
*NL*
her
for
the
first
time
that
she
had
a
rival
in
his
love
.
Her
fidelity
*NL*
turned
in
an
instant
to
bitter
hatred
,
and
he
saw
that
she
would
betray
*NL*
him
.
He
tied
her
up
,
therefore
,
that
she
might
have
no
chance
of
warning
*NL*
Sir
Henry
,
and
he
hoped
,
no
doubt
,
that
when
the
whole
countryside
put
*NL*
down
the
baronet
's
death
to
the
curse
of
his
family
,
as
they
certainly
*NL*
would
do
,
he
could
win
his
wife
back
to
accept
an
accomplished
fact
and
*NL*
to
keep
silent
upon
what
she
knew
.
In
this
I
fancy
that
in
any
case
*NL*
he
made
a
miscalculation
,
and
that
,
if
we
had
not
been
there
,
his
doom
*NL*
would
none
the
less
have
been
sealed
.
A
woman
of
Spanish
blood
does
*NL*
not
condone
such
an
injury
so
lightly
.
And
now
,
my
dear
Watson
,
without
*NL*
referring
to
my
notes
,
I
can
not
give
you
a
more
detailed
account
of
*NL*
this
curious
case
.
I
do
not
know
that
anything
essential
has
been
left
*NL*
unexplained
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
could
not
hope
to
frighten
Sir
Henry
to
death
as
he
had
done
the
old
*NL*
uncle
with
his
bogie
hound
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
beast
was
savage
and
half-starved
.
If
its
appearance
did
not
*NL*
frighten
its
victim
to
death
,
at
least
it
would
paralyze
the
resistance
*NL*
which
might
be
offered
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
doubt
.
There
only
remains
one
difficulty
.
If
Stapleton
came
into
the
*NL*
succession
,
how
could
he
explain
the
fact
that
he
,
the
heir
,
had
been
*NL*
living
unannounced
under
another
name
so
close
to
the
property
?
How
*NL*
could
he
claim
it
without
causing
suspicion
and
inquiry
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
formidable
difficulty
,
and
I
fear
that
you
ask
too
much
when
*NL*
you
expect
me
to
solve
it
.
The
past
and
the
present
are
within
the
field
*NL*
of
my
inquiry
,
but
what
a
man
may
do
in
the
future
is
a
hard
question
*NL*
to
answer
.
Mrs.
Stapleton
has
heard
her
husband
discuss
the
problem
on
*NL*
several
occasions
.
There
were
three
possible
courses
.
He
might
claim
the
*NL*
property
from
South
America
,
establish
his
identity
before
the
British
*NL*
authorities
there
and
so
obtain
the
fortune
without
ever
coming
to
*NL*
England
at
all
,
or
he
might
adopt
an
elaborate
disguise
during
the
*NL*
short
time
that
he
need
be
in
London
;
or
,
again
,
he
might
furnish
an
*NL*
accomplice
with
the
proofs
and
papers
,
putting
him
in
as
heir
,
and
*NL*
retaining
a
claim
upon
some
proportion
of
his
income
.
We
can
not
doubt
*NL*
from
what
we
know
of
him
that
he
would
have
found
some
way
out
of
the
*NL*
difficulty
.
And
now
,
my
dear
Watson
,
we
have
had
some
weeks
of
severe
*NL*
work
,
and
for
one
evening
,
I
think
,
we
may
turn
our
thoughts
into
more
*NL*
pleasant
channels
.
I
have
a
box
for
`
Les
Huguenots
.
'
Have
you
heard
the
*NL*
De
Reszkes
?
Might
I
trouble
you
then
to
be
ready
in
half
an
hour
,
and
we
*NL*
can
stop
at
Marcini
's
for
a
little
dinner
on
the
way
?
