HOWARDS

TUESDAY
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dearest
Meg
,
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
n't
going
to
be
what
we
expected
.
It
is
old
and
*NL*
little
,
and
altogether
delightful
--
red
brick
.
We
can
*NL*
scarcely
pack
in
as
it
is
,
and
the
dear
knows
what
will
*NL*
happen
when
Paul
-LRB-
younger
son
-RRB-
arrives
tomorrow
.
From
hall
*NL*
you
go
right
or
left
into
dining-room
or
drawing-room
.
Hall
*NL*
itself
is
practically
a
room
.
You
open
another
door
in
it
,
*NL*
and
there
are
the
stairs
going
up
in
a
sort
of
tunnel
to
the
*NL*
first-floor
.
Three
bedrooms
in
a
row
there
,
and
three
*NL*
attics
in
a
row
above
.
That
is
n't
all
the
house
really
,
but
*NL*
it
's
all
that
one
notices
--
nine
windows
as
you
look
up
from
*NL*
the
front
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
there
's
a
very
big
wych-elm
--
to
the
left
as
you
*NL*
look
up
--
leaning
a
little
over
the
house
,
and
standing
on
*NL*
the
boundary
between
the
garden
and
meadow
.
I
quite
love
*NL*
that
tree
already
.
Also
ordinary
elms
,
oaks
--
no
nastier
*NL*
than
ordinary
oaks
--
pear-trees
,
apple-trees
,
and
a
vine
.
No
*NL*
silver
birches
,
though
.
However
,
I
must
get
on
to
my
host
*NL*
and
hostess
.
I
only
wanted
to
show
that
it
is
n't
the
least
*NL*
what
we
expected
.
Why
did
we
settle
that
their
house
would
*NL*
be
all
gables
and
wiggles
,
and
their
garden
all
*NL*
gamboge-coloured
paths
?
I
believe
simply
because
we
*NL*
associate
them
with
expensive
hotels
--
Mrs.
Wilcox
trailing
*NL*
in
beautiful
dresses
down
long
corridors
,
Mr.
Wilcox
*NL*
bullying
porters
,
etc.
.
We
females
are
that
unjust
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
shall
be
back
Saturday
;
will
let
you
know
train
*NL*
later
.
They
are
as
angry
as
I
am
that
you
did
not
come
too
;
*NL*
really
Tibby
is
too
tiresome
,
he
starts
a
new
mortal
disease
*NL*
every
month
.
How
could
he
have
got
hay
fever
in
London
?
*NL*
and
even
if
he
could
,
it
seems
hard
that
you
should
give
up
*NL*
a
visit
to
hear
a
schoolboy
sneeze
.
Tell
him
that
Charles
*NL*
Wilcox
-LRB-
the
son
who
is
here
-RRB-
has
hay
fever
too
,
but
he
's
*NL*
brave
,
and
gets
quite
cross
when
we
inquire
after
it
.
Men
*NL*
like
the
Wilcoxes
would
do
Tibby
a
power
of
good
.
But
you
*NL*
wo
n't
agree
,
and
I
'd
better
change
the
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
long
letter
is
because
I
'm
writing
before
*NL*
breakfast
.
Oh
,
the
beautiful
vine
leaves
!
The
house
is
*NL*
covered
with
a
vine
.
I
looked
out
earlier
,
and
Mrs.
Wilcox
*NL*
was
already
in
the
garden
.
She
evidently
loves
it
.
No
*NL*
wonder
she
sometimes
looks
tired
.
She
was
watching
the
*NL*
large
red
poppies
come
out
.
Then
she
walked
off
the
lawn
to
*NL*
the
meadow
,
whose
corner
to
the
right
I
can
just
see
.
*NL*
Trail
,
trail
,
went
her
long
dress
over
the
sopping
grass
,
*NL*
and
she
came
back
with
her
hands
full
of
the
hay
that
was
*NL*
cut
yesterday
--
I
suppose
for
rabbits
or
something
,
as
she
*NL*
kept
on
smelling
it
.
The
air
here
is
delicious
.
Later
on
I
*NL*
heard
the
noise
of
croquet
balls
,
and
looked
out
again
,
and
*NL*
it
was
Charles
Wilcox
practising
;
they
are
keen
on
all
*NL*
games
.
Presently
he
started
sneezing
and
had
to
stop
.
Then
*NL*
I
hear
more
clicketing
,
and
it
is
Mr.
Wilcox
practising
,
and
*NL*
then
,
`
a-tissue
,
a-tissue
'
:
he
has
to
stop
too
.
Then
Evie
*NL*
comes
out
,
and
does
some
calisthenic
exercises
on
a
machine
*NL*
that
is
tacked
on
to
a
greengage-tree
--
they
put
everything
*NL*
to
use
--
and
then
she
says
`
a-tissue
,
'
and
in
she
goes
.
And
*NL*
finally
Mrs.
Wilcox
reappears
,
trail
,
trail
,
still
smelling
*NL*
hay
and
looking
at
the
flowers
.
I
inflict
all
this
on
you
*NL*
because
once
you
said
that
life
is
sometimes
life
and
*NL*
sometimes
only
a
drama
,
and
one
must
learn
to
distinguish
*NL*
t
`
other
from
which
,
and
up
to
now
I
have
always
put
that
*NL*
down
as
`
Meg
's
clever
nonsense
.
'
But
this
morning
,
it
really
*NL*
does
seem
not
life
but
a
play
,
and
it
did
amuse
me
*NL*
enormously
to
watch
the
W
's
.
Now
Mrs.
Wilcox
has
come
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
going
to
wear
-LSB-
omission
-RSB-
.
Last
night
Mrs.
Wilcox
*NL*
wore
an
-LSB-
omission
-RSB-
,
and
Evie
-LSB-
omission
-RSB-
.
So
it
is
n't
*NL*
exactly
a
go-as-you-please
place
,
and
if
you
shut
your
eyes
*NL*
it
still
seems
the
wiggly
hotel
that
we
expected
.
Not
if
*NL*
you
open
them
.
The
dog-roses
are
too
sweet
.
There
is
a
*NL*
great
hedge
of
them
over
the
lawn
--
magnificently
tall
,
so
*NL*
that
they
fall
down
in
garlands
,
and
nice
and
thin
at
the
*NL*
bottom
,
so
that
you
can
see
ducks
through
it
and
a
cow
.
*NL*
These
belong
to
the
farm
,
which
is
the
only
house
near
us
.
*NL*
There
goes
the
breakfast
gong
.
Much
love
.
Modified
love
to
*NL*
Tibby
.
Love
to
Aunt
Juley
;
how
good
of
her
to
come
and
keep
*NL*
you
company
,
but
what
a
bore
.
Burn
this
.
Will
write
again
*NL*
Thursday

HOWARDS
END

*NL*
FRIDAY
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dearest
Meg
,
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
having
a
glorious
time
.
I
like
them
all
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Wilcox
,
if
quieter
than
in
Germany
,
is
sweeter
than
ever
,
*NL*
and
I
never
saw
anything
like
her
steady
unselfishness
,
and
*NL*
the
best
of
it
is
that
the
others
do
not
take
advantage
of
*NL*
her
.
They
are
the
very
happiest
,
jolliest
family
that
you
*NL*
can
imagine
.
I
do
really
feel
that
we
are
making
friends
.
*NL*
The
fun
of
it
is
that
they
think
me
a
noodle
,
and
say
so
--
at
*NL*
least
Mr.
Wilcox
does
--
and
when
that
happens
,
and
one
*NL*
does
n't
mind
,
it
's
a
pretty
sure
test
,
is
n't
it
?
He
says
*NL*
the
most
horrid
things
about
women
's
suffrage
so
nicely
,
and
*NL*
when
I
said
I
believed
in
equality
he
just
folded
his
arms
*NL*
and
gave
me
such
a
setting
down
as
I
've
never
had
.
Meg
,
*NL*
shall
we
ever
learn
to
talk
less
?
I
never
felt
so
ashamed
*NL*
of
myself
in
my
life
.
I
could
n't
point
to
a
time
when
men
*NL*
had
been
equal
,
nor
even
to
a
time
when
the
wish
to
be
equal
*NL*
had
made
them
happier
in
other
ways
.
I
could
n't
say
a
*NL*
word
.
I
had
just
picked
up
the
notion
that
equality
is
good
*NL*
from
some
book
--
probably
from
poetry
,
or
you
.
Anyhow
,
it
's
*NL*
been
knocked
into
pieces
,
and
,
like
all
people
who
are
*NL*
really
strong
,
Mr.
Wilcox
did
it
without
hurting
me
.
On
the
*NL*
other
hand
,
I
laugh
at
them
for
catching
hay
fever
.
We
live
*NL*
like
fighting-cocks
,
and
Charles
takes
us
out
every
day
in
*NL*
the
motor
--
a
tomb
with
trees
in
it
,
a
hermit
's
house
,
a
*NL*
wonderful
road
that
was
made
by
the
Kings
of
*NL*
Mercia
--
tennis
--
a
cricket
match
--
bridge
--
and
at
night
we
*NL*
squeeze
up
in
this
lovely
house
.
The
whole
clan
's
here
*NL*
now
--
it
's
like
a
rabbit
warren
.
Evie
is
a
dear
.
They
want
*NL*
me
to
stop
over
Sunday
--
I
suppose
it
wo
n't
matter
if
I
do
.
*NL*
Marvellous
weather
and
the
view
's
marvellous
--
views
westward
*NL*
to
the
high
ground
.
Thank
you
for
your
letter
.
Burn
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
Your
affectionate
*NL*
Helen

HOWARDS
END
,
*NL*
SUNDAY

*NL*
*NL*
Dearest
,
dearest
Meg
,
--
I
do
not
know
what
you
will
say
:
*NL*
Paul
and
I
are
in
love
--
the
younger
son
who
only
came
here
*NL*
Wednesday
.
*NL*
*NL*

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
glanced
at
her
sister
's
note
and
pushed
it
over
the
*NL*
breakfast-table
to
her
aunt
.
There
was
a
moment
's
hush
,
and
*NL*
then
the
flood-gates
opened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
tell
you
nothing
,
Aunt
Juley
.
I
know
no
more
*NL*
than
you
do
.
We
met
--
we
only
met
the
father
and
mother
*NL*
abroad
last
spring
.
I
know
so
little
that
I
did
n't
even
*NL*
know
their
son
's
name
.
It
's
all
so
--
''
She
waved
her
hand
*NL*
and
laughed
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
that
case
it
is
far
too
sudden
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
knows
,
Aunt
Juley
,
who
knows
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Margaret
dear
,
I
mean
we
must
n't
be
unpractical
*NL*
now
that
we
've
come
to
facts
.
It
is
too
sudden
,
surely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
knows
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
Margaret
dear
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
go
for
her
other
letters
,
''
said
Margaret
.
``
No
,
I
*NL*
wo
n't
,
I
'll
finish
my
breakfast
.
In
fact
,
I
have
n't
them
.
*NL*
We
met
the
Wilcoxes
on
an
awful
expedition
that
we
made
from
*NL*
Heidelberg
to
Speyer
.
Helen
and
I
had
got
it
into
our
heads
*NL*
that
there
was
a
grand
old
cathedral
at
Speyer
--
the
*NL*
Archbishop
of
Speyer
was
one
of
the
seven
electors
--
you
*NL*
know
--
`
Speyer
,
Maintz
,
and
Koln
.
'
Those
three
sees
once
*NL*
commanded
the
Rhine
Valley
and
got
it
the
name
of
Priest
Street
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
still
feel
quite
uneasy
about
this
business
,
Margaret
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
train
crossed
by
a
bridge
of
boats
,
and
at
first
*NL*
sight
it
looked
quite
fine
.
But
oh
,
in
five
minutes
we
had
*NL*
seen
the
whole
thing
.
The
cathedral
had
been
ruined
,
*NL*
absolutely
ruined
,
by
restoration
;
not
an
inch
left
of
the
*NL*
original
structure
.
We
wasted
a
whole
day
,
and
came
across
*NL*
the
Wilcoxes
as
we
were
eating
our
sandwiches
in
the
public
*NL*
gardens
.
They
too
,
poor
things
,
had
been
taken
in
--
they
*NL*
were
actually
stopping
at
Speyer
--
and
they
rather
liked
*NL*
Helen
insisting
that
they
must
fly
with
us
to
Heidelberg
.
*NL*
As
a
matter
of
fact
,
they
did
come
on
next
day
.
We
all
took
*NL*
some
drives
together
.
They
knew
us
well
enough
to
ask
Helen
*NL*
to
come
and
see
them
--
at
least
,
I
was
asked
too
,
but
Tibby
's
*NL*
illness
prevented
me
,
so
last
Monday
she
went
alone
.
That
's
*NL*
all
.
You
know
as
much
as
I
do
now
.
It
's
a
young
man
out
*NL*
the
unknown
.
She
was
to
have
come
back
Saturday
,
but
put
*NL*
off
till
Monday
,
perhaps
on
account
of
--
I
do
n't
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
broke
off
,
and
listened
to
the
sounds
of
a
London
*NL*
morning
.
Their
house
was
in
Wickham
Place
,
and
fairly
*NL*
quiet
,
for
a
lofty
promontory
of
buildings
separated
it
from
*NL*
the
main
thoroughfare
.
One
had
the
sense
of
a
backwater
,
or
*NL*
rather
of
an
estuary
,
whose
waters
flowed
in
from
the
*NL*
invisible
sea
,
and
ebbed
into
a
profound
silence
while
the
*NL*
waves
without
were
still
beating
.
Though
the
promontory
*NL*
consisted
of
flats
--
expensive
,
with
cavernous
entrance
*NL*
halls
,
full
of
concierges
and
palms
--
it
fulfilled
its
*NL*
purpose
,
and
gained
for
the
older
houses
opposite
a
certain
*NL*
measure
of
peace
.
These
,
too
,
would
be
swept
away
in
time
,
*NL*
and
another
promontory
would
rise
upon
their
site
,
as
*NL*
humanity
piled
itself
higher
and
higher
on
the
precious
soil
*NL*
of
London
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Munt
had
her
own
method
of
interpreting
her
*NL*
nieces
.
She
decided
that
Margaret
was
a
little
hysterical
,
*NL*
and
was
trying
to
gain
time
by
a
torrent
of
talk
.
Feeling
*NL*
very
diplomatic
,
she
lamented
the
fate
of
Speyer
,
and
*NL*
declared
that
never
,
never
should
she
be
so
misguided
as
to
*NL*
visit
it
,
and
added
of
her
own
accord
that
the
principles
of
*NL*
restoration
were
ill
understood
in
Germany
.
``
The
Germans
,
''
*NL*
she
said
,
``
are
too
thorough
,
and
this
is
all
very
well
*NL*
sometimes
,
but
at
other
times
it
does
not
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
,
''
said
Margaret
;
``
Germans
are
too
thorough
.
''
*NL*
And
her
eyes
began
to
shine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
regard
you
Schlegels
as
English
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Munt
hastily
--
``
English
to
the
backbone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
leaned
forward
and
stroked
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
reminds
me
--
Helen
's
letter
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
Aunt
Juley
,
I
am
thinking
all
right
about
*NL*
Helen
's
letter
.
I
know
--
I
must
go
down
and
see
her
.
I
am
*NL*
thinking
about
her
all
right
.
I
am
meaning
to
go
down

``
But
go
with
some
plan

''
said
Mrs.
Munt
,
admitting
into
*NL*
her
kindly
voice
a
note
of
exasperation
.
``
Margaret
,
if
I
*NL*
may
interfere
,
do
n't
be
taken
by
surprise
.
What
do
you
*NL*
think
of
the
Wilcoxes
?
Are
they
our
sort
?
Are
they
likely
*NL*
people
?
Could
they
appreciate
Helen
,
who
is
to
my
mind
a
*NL*
very
special
sort
of
person
?
Do
they
care
about
Literature
*NL*
and
Art
?
That
is
most
important
when
you
come
to
think
of
*NL*
it
.
Literature
and
Art
.
Most
important
.
How
old
would
the
*NL*
son
be
?
She
says
`
younger
son
.
'
Would
he
be
in
a
position
*NL*
to
marry
?
Is
he
likely
to
make
Helen
happy
?
Did
you
gather
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
gathered
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
began
to
talk
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
in
that
case
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
that
case
I
can
make
no

do
n't
you
see

*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
contrary

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hate

I
hate
lines
of

n't
a

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
in
that
case
,
my
dear
,
why
go
down
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
was
silent
.
If
her
aunt
could
not
see
why
she
*NL*
must
go
down
,
she
was
not
going
to
tell
her
.
She
was
not
*NL*
going
to
say
``
I
love
my
dear
sister
;
I
must
be
near
her
at
*NL*
this
crisis
of
her
life
.
''
The
affections
are
more
reticent
*NL*
than
the
passions
,
and
their
expression
more
subtle
.
If
she
*NL*
herself
should
ever
fall
in
love
with
a
man
,
she
,
like
*NL*
Helen
,
would
proclaim
it
from
the
house-tops
,
but
as
she
*NL*
only
loved
a
sister
she
used
the
voiceless
language
of
sympathy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
consider
you
odd
girls
,
''
continued
Mrs.
Munt
,
``
and
*NL*
very
wonderful
girls
,
and
in
many
ways
far
older
than
your
*NL*
years
.
But
--
you
wo
n't
be
offended
?
--
frankly
I
feel
you
are
*NL*
not
up
to
this
business
.
It
requires
an
older
person
.
*NL*
Dear
,
I
have
nothing
to
call
me
back
to
Swanage
.
''
She
spread
*NL*
out
her
plump
arms
.
``
I
am
all
at
your
disposal
.
Let
me
go
*NL*
down
to
this
house
whose

I

instead
of
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Aunt
Juley

she
jumped
up
and
kissed
her

``
I

You

never
thank
you
properly
for
offering

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
understand

''
retorted
Mrs.
Munt
,
with
immense
*NL*
confidence
.
``
I
go
down
in
no
spirit

make
inquiries

Inquiries
are
necessary

Now

I
am
going
*NL*
to
be
rude

You
would
say
the
wrong
thing
;
to
a
certainty
*NL*
you
would
.
In
your
anxiety
for
Helen

happiness
you
would

offend
the
whole
of
these
Wilcoxes
by
asking
one
of
your
*NL*
impetuous
questions

not
that
one
minds
offending
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
ask
no
questions

I
have
it
in
Helen

writing
*NL*
that
she
and
a
man
are
in
love
.
There
is
no
question
to
ask
*NL*
as
long
as
she
keeps
to
that
.
All
the
rest
is
n't
worth
a
*NL*
straw
.
A
long
engagement
if
you
like

but
inquiries

*NL*
questions

no

Aunt
Juley
,
no

''
*NL*
*NL*
Away
she
hurried
,
not
beautiful
,
not
supremely
*NL*
brilliant
,
but
filled
with
something
that
took
the
place
of
*NL*
both
qualities
--
something
best
described
as
a
profound
*NL*
vivacity
,
a
continual
and
sincere
response
to
all
that
she
*NL*
encountered
in
her
path
through
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
Helen
had
written
the
same
to
me
about
a

shop-assistant

a
penniless
clerk

*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
Margaret

do
come
into

shut
the

''
--
or
if
she
had
wanted
to
marry
the
man
who
calls
for
*NL*
Carter
Paterson
,
I
should
have
said
the
same

''
Then
,
with
*NL*
one
of
those
turns
that
convinced
her
aunt
that
she
was
not
*NL*
mad
really
and
convinced
observers
of
another
type
that
she
*NL*
was
not
a
barren
theorist
,
she
added
:
``
Though
in
the
case
of
*NL*
Carter
Paterson
I
should
want
it
to
be
a
very
long
*NL*
engagement
indeed
,
I
must
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
so
,
''
said
Mrs.
Munt
;
``
and
,
indeed
,
I
can
*NL*
scarcely
follow
you

Now
,
just
imagine
if
you
said
anything
*NL*
of
that
sort
to
the
Wilcoxes
.
I
understand
it
,
but
most
*NL*
good
people
would
think
you
mad
.
Imagine
how
disconcerting
*NL*
for
Helen
!
What
is
wanted
is
a
person
who
will
go
slowly
,
*NL*
slowly
in
this
business
,
and
see
how
things
are
and
where
*NL*
they
are
likely
to
lead
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
was
down
on
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
implied
just
now
that
the
engagement
must
be
*NL*
broken
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
probably
it
must
;
but
slowly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
break
an
engagement
off
slowly
?
''
Her
eyes
lit
*NL*
up
.
``
What
's
an
engagement
made
of
,
do
you
suppose
?
I
think
*NL*
it
's
made
of
some
hard
stuff
,
that
may
snap
,
but
ca
n't
*NL*
break
.
It
is
different
to
the
other
ties
of
life
.
They
*NL*
stretch
or
bend
.
They
admit
of
degree
.
They
're
different
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
so
.
But
wo
n't
you
let
me
just
run
down
to
*NL*
Howards
House
,
and
save
you
all
the
discomfort
?
I
will
*NL*
really
not
interfere
,
but
I
do
so
thoroughly
understand
the
*NL*
kind
of
thing
you
Schlegels
want
that
one
quiet
look
round
*NL*
will
be
enough
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
again
thanked
her
,
again
kissed
her
,
and
then
*NL*
ran
upstairs
to
see
her
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
not
so
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hay
fever
had
worried
him
a
good
deal
all
night
.
*NL*
His
head
ached
,
his
eyes
were
wet
,
his
mucous
membrane
,
he
*NL*
informed
her
,
was
in
a
most
unsatisfactory
condition
.
The
*NL*
only
thing
that
made
life
worth
living
was
the
thought
of
*NL*
Walter
Savage
Landor
,
from
whose
IMAGINARY
CONVERSATIONS
she
*NL*
had
promised
to
read
at
frequent
intervals
during
the
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
rather
difficult
.
Something
must
be
done
about
*NL*
Helen
.
She
must
be
assured
that
it
is
not
a
criminal
*NL*
offence
to
love
at
first
sight
.
A
telegram
to
this
effect
*NL*
would
be
cold
and
cryptic
,
a
personal
visit
seemed
each
*NL*
moment
more
impossible
.
Now
the
doctor
arrived
,
and
said
*NL*
that
Tibby
was
quite
bad
.
Might
it
really
be
best
to
accept
*NL*
Aunt
Juley
's
kind
offer
,
and
to
send
her
down
to
Howards
End
*NL*
with
a
note
?
*NL*
*NL*
Certainly
Margaret
was
impulsive
.
She
did
swing
rapidly
*NL*
from
one
decision
to
another
.
Running
downstairs
into
the
*NL*
library
,
she
cried
--
``
Yes
,
I
have
changed
my
mind
;
I
do
wish
*NL*
that
you
would
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
train
from
King
's
Cross
at
eleven
.
At
*NL*
half-past
ten
Tibby
,
with
rare
self-effacement
,
fell
asleep
,
*NL*
and
Margaret
was
able
to
drive
her
aunt
to
the
station
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
remember
,
Aunt
Juley
,
not
to
be
drawn
into
*NL*
discussing
the
engagement
.
Give
my
letter
to
Helen
,
and
say
*NL*
whatever
you
feel
yourself
,
but
do
keep
clear
of
the
*NL*
relatives
.
We
have
scarcely
got
their
names
straight
yet
,
*NL*
and
besides
,
that
sort
of
thing
is
so
uncivilized
and
wrong
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
uncivilized
?
''
queried
Mrs.
Munt
,
fearing
that
she
*NL*
was
losing
the
point
of
some
brilliant
remark
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
used
an
affected
word
.
I
only
meant
would
you
*NL*
please
only
talk
the
thing
over
with
Helen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
with
Helen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
--
''
But
it
was
no
moment
to
expound
the
personal
*NL*
nature
of
love
.
Even
Margaret
shrank
from
it
,
and
contented
*NL*
herself
with
stroking
her
good
aunt
's
hand
,
and
with
*NL*
meditating
,
half
sensibly
and
half
poetically
,
on
the
*NL*
journey
that
was
about
to
begin
from
King
's
Cross
.
*NL*
*NL*
Like
many
others
who
have
lived
long
in
a
great
capital
,
*NL*
she
had
strong
feelings
about
the
various
railway
termini
.
*NL*
They
are
our
gates
to
the
glorious
and
the
unknown
.
Through
*NL*
them
we
pass
out
into
adventure
and
sunshine
,
to
them
alas
!
*NL*
we
return
.
In
Paddington
all
Cornwall
is
latent
and
the
*NL*
remoter
west
;
down
the
inclines
of
Liverpool
Street
lie
*NL*
fenlands
and
the
illimitable
Broads
;
Scotland
is
through
the
*NL*
pylons
of
Euston
;
Wessex
behind
the
poised
chaos
of
*NL*
Waterloo
.
Italians
realize
this
,
as
is
natural
;
those
of
*NL*
them
who
are
so
unfortunate
as
to
serve
as
waiters
in
Berlin
*NL*
call
the
Anhalt
Bahnhof
the
Stazione
d'Italia
,
because
by
it
*NL*
they
must
return
to
their
homes
.
And
he
is
a
chilly
*NL*
Londoner
who
does
not
endow
his
stations
with
some
*NL*
personality
,
and
extend
to
them
,
however
shyly
,
the
emotions
*NL*
of
fear
and
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
Margaret
--
I
hope
that
it
will
not
set
the
reader
*NL*
against
her
--
the
station
of
King
's
Cross
had
always
*NL*
suggested
Infinity
.
Its
very
situation
--
withdrawn
a
little
*NL*
behind
the
facile
splendours
of
St.
Pancras
--
implied
a
*NL*
comment
on
the
materialism
of
life
.
Those
two
great
arches
,
*NL*
colourless
,
indifferent
,
shouldering
between
them
an
*NL*
unlovely
clock
,
were
fit
portals
for
some
eternal
adventure
,
*NL*
whose
issue
might
be
prosperous
,
but
would
certainly
not
be
*NL*
expressed
in
the
ordinary
language
of
prosperity
.
If
you
*NL*
think
this
ridiculous
,
remember
that
it
is
not
Margaret
who
*NL*
is
telling
you
about
it
;
and
let
me
hasten
to
add
that
they
*NL*
were
in
plenty
of
time
for
the
train
;
that
Mrs.
Munt
,
though
*NL*
she
took
a
second-class
ticket
,
was
put
by
the
guard
into
a
*NL*
first
-LRB-
only
two
seconds
on
the
train
,
one
smoking
and
the
*NL*
other
babies
--
one
can
not
be
expected
to
travel
with
babies
-RRB-
;
*NL*
and
that
Margaret
,
on
her
return
to
Wickham
Place
,
was
*NL*
confronted
with
the
following
telegram
:
*NL*
*NL*
ALL
OVER
.
WISH
I
HAD
NEVER
WRITTEN
.
TELL
NO
ONE
.
*NL*
--
HELEN
*NL*
*NL*
But
Aunt
Juley
was
gone
--
gone
irrevocably
,
and
no
power
*NL*
on
earth
could
stop
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
3
*NL*
*NL*
Most
complacently
did
Mrs.
Munt
rehearse
her
mission
.
Her
*NL*
nieces
were
independent
young
women
,
and
it
was
not
often
*NL*
that
she
was
able
to
help
them
.
Emily
's
daughters
had
never
*NL*
been
quite
like
other
girls
.
They
had
been
left
motherless
*NL*
when
Tibby
was
born
,
when
Helen
was
five
and
Margaret
*NL*
herself
but
thirteen
.
It
was
before
the
passing
of
the
*NL*
Deceased
Wife
's
Sister
Bill
,
so
Mrs.
Munt
could
without
*NL*
impropriety
offer
to
go
and
keep
house
at
Wickham
Place
.
*NL*
But
her
brother-in-law
,
who
was
peculiar
and
a
German
,
had
*NL*
referred
the
question
to
Margaret
,
who
with
the
crudity
of
*NL*
youth
had
answered
,
``
No
,
they
could
manage
much
better
*NL*
alone
.
''
Five
years
later
Mr.
Schlegel
had
died
too
,
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Munt
had
repeated
her
offer
.
Margaret
,
crude
no
longer
,
had
*NL*
been
grateful
and
extremely
nice
,
but
the
substance
of
her
*NL*
answer
had
been
the
same
.
``
I
must
not
interfere
a
third
*NL*
time
,
''
thought
Mrs.
Munt
.
However
,
of
course
she
did
.
She
*NL*
learnt
,
to
her
horror
,
that
Margaret
,
now
of
age
,
was
taking
*NL*
her
money
out
of
the
old
safe
investments
and
putting
it
*NL*
into
Foreign
Things
,
which
always
smash
.
Silence
would
have
*NL*
been
criminal
.
Her
own
fortune
was
invested
in
Home
Rails
,
*NL*
and
most
ardently
did
she
beg
her
niece
to
imitate
her
.
*NL*
``
Then
we
should
be
together
,
dear
.
''
Margaret
,
out
of
*NL*
politeness
,
invested
a
few
hundreds
in
the
Nottingham
and
*NL*
Derby
Railway
,
and
though
the
Foreign
Things
did
admirably
*NL*
and
the
Nottingham
and
Derby
declined
with
the
steady
*NL*
dignity
of
which
only
Home
Rails
are
capable
,
Mrs.
Munt
*NL*
never
ceased
to
rejoice
,
and
to
say
,
``
I
did
manage
that
,
at
*NL*
all
events
.
When
the
smash
comes
poor
Margaret
will
have
a
*NL*
nest-egg
to
fall
back
upon
.
''
This
year
Helen
came
of
age
,
*NL*
and
exactly
the
same
thing
happened
in
Helen
's
case
;
she
*NL*
also
would
shift
her
money
out
of
Consols
,
but
she
,
too
,
*NL*
almost
without
being
pressed
,
consecrated
a
fraction
of
it
*NL*
to
the
Nottingham
and
Derby
Railway
.
So
far
so
good
,
but
in
*NL*
social
matters
their
aunt
had
accomplished
nothing
.
Sooner
*NL*
or
later
the
girls
would
enter
on
the
process
known
as
*NL*
throwing
themselves
away
,
and
if
they
had
delayed
hitherto
,
*NL*
it
was
only
that
they
might
throw
themselves
more
vehemently
*NL*
in
the
future
.
They
saw
too
many
people
at
Wickham
*NL*
Place
--
unshaven
musicians
,
an
actress
even
,
German
cousins
*NL*
-LRB-
one
knows
what
foreigners
are
-RRB-
,
acquaintances
picked
up
at
*NL*
Continental
hotels
-LRB-
one
knows
what
they
are
too
-RRB-
.
It
was
*NL*
interesting
,
and
down
at
Swanage
no
one
appreciated
culture
*NL*
more
than
Mrs.
Munt
;
but
it
was
dangerous
,
and
disaster
was
*NL*
bound
to
come
.
How
right
she
was
,
and
how
lucky
to
be
on
*NL*
the
spot
when
the
disaster
came
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
train
sped
northward
,
under
innumerable
tunnels
.
It
*NL*
was
only
an
hour
's
journey
,
but
Mrs.
Munt
had
to
raise
and
*NL*
lower
the
window
again
and
again
.
She
passed
through
the
*NL*
South
Welwyn
Tunnel
,
saw
light
for
a
moment
,
and
entered
the
*NL*
North
Welwyn
Tunnel
,
of
tragic
fame
.
She
traversed
the
*NL*
immense
viaduct
,
whose
arches
span
untroubled
meadows
and
*NL*
the
dreamy
flow
of
Tewin
Water
.
She
skirted
the
parks
of
*NL*
politicians
.
At
times
the
Great
North
Road
accompanied
her
,
*NL*
more
suggestive
of
infinity
than
any
railway
,
awakening
,
*NL*
after
a
nap
of
a
hundred
years
,
to
such
life
as
is
conferred
*NL*
by
the
stench
of
motor-cars
,
and
to
such
culture
as
is
*NL*
implied
by
the
advertisements
of
antibilious
pills
.
To
*NL*
history
,
to
tragedy
,
to
the
past
,
to
the
future
,
Mrs.
Munt
*NL*
remained
equally
indifferent
;
hers
but
to
concentrate
on
the
*NL*
end
of
her
journey
,
and
to
rescue
poor
Helen
from
this
*NL*
dreadful
mess
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
station
for
Howards
End
was
at
Hilton
,
one
of
the
*NL*
large
villages
that
are
strung
so
frequently
along
the
North
*NL*
Road
,
and
that
owe
their
size
to
the
traffic
of
coaching
and
*NL*
pre-coaching
days
.
Being
near
London
,
it
had
not
shared
in
*NL*
the
rural
decay
,
and
its
long
High
Street
had
budded
out
*NL*
right
and
left
into
residential
estates
.
For
about
a
mile
a
*NL*
series
of
tiled
and
slated
houses
passed
before
Mrs.
Munt
's
*NL*
inattentive
eyes
,
a
series
broken
at
one
point
by
six
Danish
*NL*
tumuli
that
stood
shoulder
to
shoulder
along
the
highroad
,
*NL*
tombs
of
soldiers
.
Beyond
these
tumuli
habitations
*NL*
thickened
,
and
the
train
came
to
a
standstill
in
a
tangle
*NL*
that
was
almost
a
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
station
,
like
the
scenery
,
like
Helen
's
letters
,
*NL*
struck
an
indeterminate
note
.
Into
which
country
will
it
*NL*
lead
,
England
or
Suburbia
?
It
was
new
,
it
had
island
*NL*
platforms
and
a
subway
,
and
the
superficial
comfort
exacted
*NL*
by
business
men
.
But
it
held
hints
of
local
life
,
personal
*NL*
intercourse
,
as
even
Mrs.
Munt
was
to
discover
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
a
house
,
''
she
confided
to
the
ticket
boy
.
``
Its
*NL*
name
is
Howards
Lodge
.
Do
you
know
where
it
is
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Wilcox
!
''
the
boy
called
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
young
man
in
front
of
them
turned
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
wanting
Howards
End
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
go
forward
,
though
Mrs.
*NL*
Munt
was
too
much
agitated
even
to
stare
at
the
stranger
.
*NL*
But
remembering
that
there
were
two
brothers
,
she
had
the
*NL*
sense
to
say
to
him
,
``
Excuse
me
asking
,
but
are
you
the
*NL*
younger
Mr.
Wilcox
or
the
elder
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
younger
.
Can
I
do
anything
for
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
''
--
she
controlled
herself
with
difficulty
.
*NL*
``
Really
.
Are
you
?
I
--
''
She
moved
away
from
the
ticket
boy
*NL*
and
lowered
her
voice
.
``
I
am
Miss
Schlegels
aunt
.
I
ought
*NL*
to
introduce
myself
,
ought
n't
I
?
My
name
is
Mrs.
Munt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
conscious
that
he
raised
his
cap
and
said
quite
*NL*
coolly
,
``
Oh
,
rather
;
Miss
Schlegel
is
stopping
with
us
.
Did
*NL*
you
want
to
see
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Possibly
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
call
you
a
cab
.
No
;
wait
a
mo
--
''
He
thought
.
*NL*
``
Our
motor
's
here
.
I
'll
run
you
up
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
very
kind
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
,
if
you
'll
just
wait
till
they
bring
out
a
*NL*
parcel
from
the
office
.
This
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
niece
is
not
with
you
by
any
chance
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
came
over
with
my
father
.
He
has
gone
on
north
*NL*
in
your
train
.
You
'll
see
Miss
Schlegel
at
lunch
.
You
're
*NL*
coming
up
to
lunch
,
I
hope
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
to
come
UP
,
''
said
Mrs.
Munt
,
not
*NL*
committing
herself
to
nourishment
until
she
had
studied
*NL*
Helen
's
lover
a
little
more
.
He
seemed
a
gentleman
,
but
had
*NL*
so
rattled
her
round
that
her
powers
of
observation
were
*NL*
numbed
.
She
glanced
at
him
stealthily
.
To
a
feminine
eye
*NL*
there
was
nothing
amiss
in
the
sharp
depressions
at
the
*NL*
corners
of
his
mouth
,
nor
in
the
rather
box-like
*NL*
construction
of
his
forehead
.
He
was
dark
,
clean-shaven
and
*NL*
seemed
accustomed
to
command
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
front
or
behind
?
Which
do
you
prefer
?
It
may
be
*NL*
windy
in
front
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
front
if
I
may
;
then
we
can
talk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
excuse
me
one
moment
--
I
ca
n't
think
what
they
're
*NL*
doing
with
that
parcel
.
''
He
strode
into
the
booking-office
*NL*
and
called
with
a
new
voice
:
``
Hi
!
hi
,
you
there
!
Are
you
*NL*
going
to
keep
me
waiting
all
day
?
Parcel
for
Wilcox
,
*NL*
Howards
End
.
Just
look
sharp
!
''
Emerging
,
he
said
in
*NL*
quieter
tones
:
``
This
station
's
abominably
organized
;
if
I
*NL*
had
my
way
,
the
whole
lot
of
'em
should
get
the
sack
.
May
I
*NL*
help
you
in
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
very
good
of
you
,
''
said
Mrs.
Munt
,
as
she
*NL*
settled
herself
into
a
luxurious
cavern
of
red
leather
,
and
*NL*
suffered
her
person
to
be
padded
with
rugs
and
shawls
.
She
*NL*
was
more
civil
than
she
had
intended
,
but
really
this
young
*NL*
man
was
very
kind
.
Moreover
,
she
was
a
little
afraid
of
*NL*
him
:
his
self-possession
was
extraordinary
.
``
Very
good
*NL*
indeed
,
''
she
repeated
,
adding
:
``
It
is
just
what
I
should
*NL*
have
wished
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
of
you
to
say
so
,
''
he
replied
,
with
a
slight
*NL*
look
of
surprise
,
which
,
like
most
slight
looks
,
escaped
*NL*
Mrs.
Munt
's
attention
.
``
I
was
just
tooling
my
father
over
*NL*
to
catch
the
down
train
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
we
heard
from
Helen
this
morning

''
*NL*
*NL*
Young
Wilcox
was
pouring
in
petrol
,
starting
his
engine
,
*NL*
and
performing
other
actions
with
which
this
story
has
no
*NL*
concern
.
The
great
car
began
to
rock
,
and
the
form
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Munt
,
trying
to
explain
things
,
sprang
agreeably
up
and
down
*NL*
among
the
red
cushions
.
``
The
mater
will
be
very
glad
to
see
*NL*
you
,
''
he
mumbled
.
``
Hi
!
I
say
.
Parcel
for
Howards
End
.
*NL*
Bring
it
out
.
Hi
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
bearded
porter
emerged
with
the
parcel
in
one
hand
and
*NL*
an
entry
book
in
the
other
.
With
the
gathering
whir
of
the
*NL*
motor
these
ejaculations
mingled
:
``
Sign
,
must
I
?
Why
*NL*
the
--
should
I
sign
after
all
this
bother
?
Not
even
got
a
*NL*
pencil
on
you
?
Remember
next
time
I
report
you
to
the
*NL*
station-master
.
My
time
's
of
value
,
though
yours
may
n't
*NL*
be

Here
''
--
here
being
a
tip
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Extremely
sorry
,
Mrs.
Munt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
,
Mr.
Wilcox
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
object
to
going
through
the
village
?
It
is
*NL*
rather
a
longer
spin
,
but
I
have
one
or
two
commissions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
love
going
through
the
village
.
Naturally
I
*NL*
am
very
anxious
to
talk
things
over
with
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
said
this
she
felt
ashamed
,
for
she
was
*NL*
disobeying
Margaret
's
instructions
.
Only
disobeying
them
in
*NL*
the
letter
,
surely
.
Margaret
had
only
warned
her
against
*NL*
discussing
the
incident
with
outsiders
.
Surely
it
was
not
*NL*
``
uncivilized
or
wrong
''
to
discuss
it
with
the
young
man
*NL*
himself
,
since
chance
had
thrown
them
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
reticent
fellow
,
he
made
no
reply
.
Mounting
by
her
*NL*
side
,
he
put
on
gloves
and
spectacles
,
and
off
they
drove
,
*NL*
the
bearded
porter
--
life
is
a
mysterious
business
--
looking
*NL*
after
them
with
admiration
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
wind
was
in
their
faces
down
the
station
road
,
*NL*
blowing
the
dust
into
Mrs.
Munt
's
eyes
.
But
as
soon
as
they
*NL*
turned
into
the
Great
North
Road
she
opened
fire
.
``
You
can
*NL*
well
imagine
,
''
she
said
,
``
that
the
news
was
a
great
shock
to
*NL*
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
news
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Wilcox
,
''
she
said
frankly
.
``
Margaret
has
told
me
*NL*
everything
--
everything
.
I
have
seen
Helen
's
letter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
look
her
in
the
face
,
as
his
eyes
were
*NL*
fixed
on
his
work
;
he
was
travelling
as
quickly
as
he
dared
*NL*
down
the
High
Street
.
But
he
inclined
his
head
in
her
*NL*
direction
,
and
said
,
``
I
beg
your
pardon
;
I
did
n't
catch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
Helen

Helen
,
of
course
.
Helen
is
a
very
*NL*
exceptional
person

I
am
sure
you
will
let
me
say
this
,
*NL*
feeling
towards
her
as
you
do
--
indeed
,
all
the
Schlegels
are
*NL*
exceptional
.
I
come
in
no
spirit
of
interference

but
it
*NL*
was
a
great
shock

*NL*
*NL*
They
drew
up
opposite
a
draper
's
.
Without
replying
,
he
*NL*
turned
round
in
his
seat
,
and
contemplated
the
cloud
of
dust
*NL*
that
they
had
raised
in
their
passage
through
the
village
.
*NL*
It
was
settling
again
,
but
not
all
into
the
road
from
which
*NL*
he
had
taken
it
.
Some
of
it
had
percolated
through
the
open
*NL*
windows
,
some
had
whitened
the
roses
and
gooseberries
of
the
*NL*
wayside
gardens
,
while
a
certain
proportion
had
entered
the
*NL*
lungs
of
the
villagers
.
``
I
wonder
when
they
'll
learn
wisdom
*NL*
and
tar
the
roads
,
''
was
his
comment
.
Then
a
man
ran
out
of
*NL*
the
draper
's
with
a
roll
of
oilcloth
,
and
off
they
went
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Margaret
could
not
come
herself
,
on
account
of
poor
*NL*
Tibby

so
I
am
here
to
represent
her
and
to
have
a
good
talk

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sorry
to
be
so
dense

''
said
the
young
man
,
again
*NL*
drawing
up
outside
a
shop
.
``
But
I
still
have
n't
quite
understood

*NL*
*NL*
``
Helen

Mr.
Wilcox

my
niece

you

*NL*
*NL*
He
pushed
up
his
goggles
and
gazed
at
her
,
absolutely
*NL*
bewildered
.
Horror
smote
her
to
the
heart
,
for
even
she
*NL*
began
to
suspect
that
they
were
at
cross-purposes
,
and
that
*NL*
she
had
commenced
her
mission
by
some
hideous
blunder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Schlegel
and
myself

he
asked
,
compressing
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
trust
there
has
been
no
misunderstanding
,
''
quavered
*NL*
Mrs.
Munt
.
``
Her

certainly
read
that
way

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
way

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
you

she

She
paused
,
then
drooped
her
eyelids
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
catch
your
meaning
,
''
he
said
stickily
.
``
What
*NL*
an
extraordinary
mistake
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
did
n't
the
least

she
stammered
,
getting
*NL*
blood-red
in
the
face
,
and
wishing
she
had
never
been
born
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Scarcely
,
as
I
am
already
engaged
to
another
lady
.
''
*NL*
There
was
a
moment
's
silence
,
and
then
he
caught
his
breath
*NL*
and
exploded
with
,
``
Oh
,
good
God
!
Do
n't
tell
me
it
's
some
*NL*
silliness
of
Paul
's

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
are
Paul

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
did
you
say
so
at
the
station

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
said
nothing

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

*NL*
``

My

*NL*
``
Younger

may
mean
son
as
opposed
to
father

or
second

brother
as
opposed
to
first
.
There
is
much
to
be
said
for
*NL*
either
view
,
and
later
on
they
said
it
.
But
they
had
other
*NL*
questions
before
them
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
to
tell
me

*NL*
*NL*
But
she
did
not
like
his
voice
.
He
sounded
as
if
he
was
*NL*
talking
to
a
porter
,
and
,
certain
that
he
had
deceived
her
*NL*
at
the
station
,
she
too
grew
angry
.

Mrs.

did
it

On

she
blazed
out

Charles
clenched
his
teeth

sent
the
motor
swerving
*NL*
all
over
the
lane

*NL*
*NL*
She
screamed
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
they
played
the
game
of
Capping
Families
,
a
round
of
*NL*
which
is
always
played
when
love
would
unite
two
members
of
*NL*
our
race
.
But
they
played
it
with
unusual
vigour
,
stating
*NL*
in
so
many
words
that
Schlegels
were
better
than
Wilcoxes
,
*NL*
Wilcoxes
better
than
Schlegels
.
They
flung
decency
aside
.
*NL*
The
man
was
young
,
the
woman
deeply
stirred
;
in
both
a
vein
*NL*
of
coarseness
was
latent
.
Their
quarrel
was
no
more
*NL*
surprising
than
are
most
quarrels
--
inevitable
at
the
time
,
*NL*
incredible
afterwards
.
But
it
was
more
than
usually
*NL*
futile
.
A
few
minutes
,
and
they
were
enlightened
.
The
*NL*
motor
drew
up
at
Howards
End
,
and
Helen
,
looking
very
pale
,
*NL*
ran
out
to
meet
her
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aunt
Juley

The
climax
was
too
much
for
Mrs.

She
burst
into
tears

*NL*
*NL*
``

Charles

pulling

off

``

``

came
out

``

there
any

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
a
voice
from
the
garden
.
``
Charles
,
*NL*
dear
Charles
,
one
does
n't
ask
plain
questions
.
There
are
n't
*NL*
such
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
all
silent
.
It
was
Mrs.
Wilcox
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
approached
just
as
Helen
's
letter
had
described
her
,
*NL*
trailing
noiselessly
over
the
lawn
,
and
there
was
actually
a
*NL*
wisp
of
hay
in
her
hands
.
She
seemed
to
belong
not
to
the
*NL*
young
people
and
their
motor
,
but
to
the
house
,
and
to
the
*NL*
tree
that
overshadowed
it
.
One
knew
that
she
worshipped
the
*NL*
past
,
and
that
the
instinctive
wisdom
the
past
can
alone
*NL*
bestow
had
descended
upon
her
--
that
wisdom
to
which
we
give
*NL*
the
clumsy
name
of
aristocracy
.
High
born
she
might
not
*NL*
be
.
But
assuredly
she
cared
about
her
ancestors
,
and
let
*NL*
them
help
her
.
When
she
saw
Charles
angry
,
Paul
frightened
,
*NL*
and
Mrs.
Munt
in
tears
,
she
heard
her
ancestors
say
,
*NL*
``
Separate
those
human
beings
who
will
hurt
each
other
most
.
*NL*
The
rest
can
wait
.
''
So
she
did
not
ask
questions
.
Still
*NL*
less
did
she
pretend
that
nothing
had
happened
,
as
a
*NL*
competent
society
hostess
would
have
done
.
She
said
,
``
Miss
*NL*
Schlegel
,
would
you
take
your
aunt
up
to
your
room
or
to
my
*NL*
room
,
whichever
you
think
best
.
Paul
,
do
find
Evie
,
and
*NL*
tell
her
lunch
for
six
,
but
I
'm
not
sure
whether
we
shall
*NL*
all
be
downstairs
for
it
.
''
And
when
they
had
obeyed
her
,
she
*NL*
turned
to
her
elder
son
,
who
still
stood
in
the
throbbing
*NL*
stinking
car
,
and
smiled
at
him
with
tenderness
,
and
without
*NL*
a
word
,
turned
away
from
him
towards
her
flowers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
,
''
he
called
,
``
are
you
aware
that
Paul
has
been
*NL*
playing
the
fool
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
right
,
dear
.
They
have
broken
off
the
engagement
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Engagement
--
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
do
not
love
any
longer
,
if
you
prefer
it
put
that
*NL*
way

said
Mrs.
Wilcox
,
stooping
down
to
smell
a
rose
.

*NL*
Chapter
4
*NL*
*NL*
Helen
and
her
aunt
returned
to
Wickham
Place
in
a
state
of
*NL*
collapse
,
and
for
a
little
time
Margaret
had
three
invalids
*NL*
on
her
hands
.
Mrs.
Munt
soon
recovered
.
She
possessed
to
a
*NL*
remarkable
degree
the
power
of
distorting
the
past
,
and
*NL*
before
many
days
were
over
she
had
forgotten
the
part
played
*NL*
by
her
own
imprudence
in
the
catastrophe
.
Even
at
the
*NL*
crisis
she
had
cried
,
``
Thank
goodness
,
poor
Margaret
is
*NL*
saved
this
!
''
which
during
the
journey
to
London
evolved
*NL*
into
,
``
It
had
to
be
gone
through
by
someone
,
''
which
in
its
*NL*
turn
ripened
into
the
permanent
form
of
``
The
one
time
I
*NL*
really
did
help
Emily
's
girls
was
over
the
Wilcox
*NL*
business
.
''
But
Helen
was
a
more
serious
patient
.
New
ideas
*NL*
had
burst
upon
her
like
a
thunder
clap
,
and
by
them
and
by
*NL*
her
reverberations
she
had
been
stunned
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
truth
was
that
she
had
fallen
in
love
,
not
with
an
*NL*
individual
,
but
with
a
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
Paul
arrived
she
had
,
as
it
were
,
been
tuned
up
*NL*
into
his
key
.
The
energy
of
the
Wilcoxes
had
fascinated
*NL*
her
,
had
created
new
images
of
beauty
in
her
responsive
*NL*
mind
.
To
be
all
day
with
them
in
the
open
air
,
to
sleep
at
*NL*
night
under
their
roof
,
had
seemed
the
supreme
joy
of
life
,
*NL*
and
had
led
to
that
abandonment
of
personality
that
is
a
*NL*
possible
prelude
to
love
.
She
had
liked
giving
in
to
Mr.
*NL*
Wilcox
,
or
Evie
,
or
Charles
;
she
had
liked
being
told
that
*NL*
her
notions
of
life
were
sheltered
or
academic
;
that
*NL*
Equality
was
nonsense
,
Votes
for
Women
nonsense
,
Socialism
*NL*
nonsense
,
Art
and
Literature
,
except
when
conducive
to
*NL*
strengthening
the
character
,
nonsense
.
One
by
one
the
*NL*
Schlegel
fetiches
had
been
overthrown
,
and
,
though
*NL*
professing
to
defend
them
,
she
had
rejoiced
.
When
Mr.
*NL*
Wilcox
said
that
one
sound
man
of
business
did
more
good
to
*NL*
the
world
than
a
dozen
of
your
social
reformers
,
she
had
*NL*
swallowed
the
curious
assertion
without
a
gasp
,
and
had
*NL*
leant
back
luxuriously
among
the
cushions
of
his
motor-car
.
*NL*
When
Charles
said
,
``
Why
be
so
polite
to
servants
?
they
*NL*
do
n't
understand
it
,
''
she
had
not
given
the
Schlegel
retort
*NL*
of
,
``
If
they
do
n't
understand
it
,
I
do
.
''
No
;
she
had
vowed
*NL*
to
be
less
polite
to
servants
in
the
future
.
``
I
am
swathed
*NL*
in
cant
,
''
she
thought
,
``
and
it
is
good
for
me
to
be
stripped
*NL*
of
it
.
''
And
all
that
she
thought
or
did
or
breathed
was
a
*NL*
quiet
preparation
for
Paul
.
Paul
was
inevitable
.
Charles
*NL*
was
taken
up
with
another
girl
,
Mr.
Wilcox
was
so
old
,
Evie
*NL*
so
young
,
Mrs.
Wilcox
so
different
.
Round
the
absent
*NL*
brother
she
began
to
throw
the
halo
of
Romance
,
to
irradiate
*NL*
him
with
all
the
splendour
of
those
happy
days
,
to
feel
that
*NL*
in
him
she
should
draw
nearest
to
the
robust
ideal
.
He
and
*NL*
she
were
about
the
same
age
,
Evie
said
.
Most
people
thought
*NL*
Paul
handsomer
than
his
brother
.
He
was
certainly
a
better
*NL*
shot
,
though
not
so
good
at
golf
.
And
when
Paul
appeared
,
*NL*
flushed
with
the
triumph
of
getting
through
an
examination
,
*NL*
and
ready
to
flirt
with
any
pretty
girl
,
Helen
met
him
*NL*
halfway
,
or
more
than
halfway
,
and
turned
towards
him
on
the
*NL*
Sunday
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
been
talking
of
his
approaching
exile
in
Nigeria
,
*NL*
and
he
should
have
continued
to
talk
of
it
,
and
allowed
*NL*
their
guest
to
recover
.
But
the
heave
of
her
bosom
*NL*
flattered
him
.
Passion
was
possible
,
and
he
became
*NL*
passionate
.
Deep
down
in
him
something
whispered
,
``
This
*NL*
girl
would
let
you
kiss
her
;
you
might
not
have
such
a
*NL*
chance
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
``
how
it
happened
,
''
or
,
rather
,
how
Helen
*NL*
described
it
to
her
sister
,
using
words
even
more
*NL*
unsympathetic
than
my
own
.
But
the
poetry
of
that
kiss
,
the
*NL*
wonder
of
it
,
the
magic
that
there
was
in
life
for
hours
*NL*
after
it
--
who
can
describe
that
?
It
is
so
easy
for
an
*NL*
Englishman
to
sneer
at
these
chance
collisions
of
human
*NL*
beings
.
To
the
insular
cynic
and
the
insular
moralist
they
*NL*
offer
an
equal
opportunity
.
It
is
so
easy
to
talk
of
*NL*
``
passing
emotion
,
''
and
how
to
forget
how
vivid
the
emotion
*NL*
was
ere
it
passed
.
Our
impulse
to
sneer
,
to
forget
,
is
at
*NL*
root
a
good
one
.
We
recognize
that
emotion
is
not
enough
,
*NL*
and
that
men
and
women
are
personalities
capable
of
*NL*
sustained
relations
,
not
mere
opportunities
for
an
*NL*
electrical
discharge
.
Yet
we
rate
the
impulse
too
highly
.
*NL*
We
do
not
admit
that
by
collisions
of
this
trivial
sort
the
*NL*
doors
of
heaven
may
be
shaken
open
.
To
Helen
,
at
all
*NL*
events
,
her
life
was
to
bring
nothing
more
intense
than
the
*NL*
embrace
of
this
boy
who
played
no
part
in
it
.
He
had
drawn
*NL*
her
out
of
the
house
,
where
there
was
danger
of
surprise
and
*NL*
light
;
he
had
led
her
by
a
path
he
knew
,
until
they
stood
*NL*
under
the
column
of
the
vast
wych-elm
.
A
man
in
the
*NL*
darkness
,
he
had
whispered
``
I
love
you
''
when
she
was
*NL*
desiring
love
.
In
time
his
slender
personality
faded
,
the
*NL*
scene
that
he
had
evoked
endured
.
In
all
the
variable
years
*NL*
that
followed
she
never
saw
the
like
of
it
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
,
''
said
Margaret
--
``
at
least
,
I
understand
*NL*
as
much
as
ever
is
understood
of
these
things
.
Tell
me
now
*NL*
what
happened
on
the
Monday
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
over
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
,
Helen
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
still
happy
while
I
dressed
,
but
as
I
came
*NL*
downstairs
I
got
nervous
,
and
when
I
went
into
the
*NL*
dining-room
I
knew
it
was
no
good
.
There
was
Evie
--
I
ca
n't
*NL*
explain
--
managing
the
tea-urn
,
and
Mr.
Wilcox
reading
the
*NL*
TIMES
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
Paul
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
and
Charles
was
talking
to
him
about
Stocks
and
*NL*
Shares
,
and
he
looked
frightened
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
slight
indications
the
sisters
could
convey
much
to
*NL*
each
other
.
Margaret
saw
horror
latent
in
the
scene
,
and
*NL*
Helen
's
next
remark
did
not
surprise
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Somehow
,
when
that
kind
of
man
looks
frightened
it
is
*NL*
too
awful
.
It
is
all
right
for
us
to
be
frightened
,
or
for
*NL*
men
of
another
sort
--
father
,
for
instance
;
but
for
men
like
*NL*
that
!
When
I
saw
all
the
others
so
placid
,
and
Paul
mad
*NL*
with
terror
in
case
I
said
the
wrong
thing
,
I
felt
for
a
*NL*
moment
that
the
whole
Wilcox
family
was
a
fraud
,
just
a
wall
*NL*
of
newspapers
and
motor-cars
and
golf-clubs
,
and
that
if
it
*NL*
fell
I
should
find
nothing
behind
it
but
panic
and
*NL*
emptiness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
that
.
The
Wilcoxes
struck
me
as
being
*NL*
genuine
people
,
particularly
the
wife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
n't
really
think
that
.
But
Paul
was
so
*NL*
broad-shouldered
;
all
kinds
of
extraordinary
things
made
it
*NL*
worse
,
and
I
knew
that
it
would
never
do
--
never
.
I
said
to
*NL*
him
after
breakfast
,
when
the
others
were
practising
*NL*
strokes
,
`
We
rather
lost
our
heads
,
'
and
he
looked
better
at
*NL*
once
,
though
frightfully
ashamed
.
He
began
a
speech
about
*NL*
having
no
money
to
marry
on
,
but
it
hurt
him
to
make
it
,
and
*NL*
I
--
stopped
him
.
Then
he
said
,
'
I
must
beg
your
pardon
over
*NL*
this
,
Miss
Schlegel
;
I
ca
n't
think
what
came
over
me
last
*NL*
night
.
'
And
I
said
,
`
Nor
what
over
me
;
never
mind
.
'
And
then
*NL*
we
parted
--
at
least
,
until
I
remembered
that
I
had
written
*NL*
straight
off
to
tell
you
the
night
before
,
and
that
*NL*
frightened
him
again
.
I
asked
him
to
send
a
telegram
for
*NL*
me
,
for
he
knew
you
would
be
coming
or
something
;
and
he
*NL*
tried
to
get
hold
of
the
motor
,
but
Charles
and
Mr.
Wilcox
*NL*
wanted
it
to
go
to
the
station
;
and
Charles
offered
to
send
*NL*
the
telegram
for
me
,
and
then
I
had
to
say
that
the
telegram
*NL*
was
of
no
consequence
,
for
Paul
said
Charles
might
read
it
,
*NL*
and
though
I
wrote
it
out
several
times
,
he
always
said
*NL*
people
would
suspect
something
.
He
took
it
himself
at
last
,
*NL*
pretending
that
he
must
walk
down
to
get
cartridges
,
and
,
*NL*
what
with
one
thing
and
the
other
,
it
was
not
handed
in
at
*NL*
the
Post
Office
until
too
late
.
It
was
the
most
terrible
*NL*
morning
.
Paul
disliked
me
more
and
more
,
and
Evie
talked
*NL*
cricket
averages
till
I
nearly
screamed
.
I
can
not
think
how
*NL*
I
stood
her
all
the
other
days
.
At
last
Charles
and
his
*NL*
father
started
for
the
station
,
and
then
came
your
telegram
*NL*
warning
me
that
Aunt
Juley
was
coming
by
that
train
,
and
*NL*
Paul
--
oh
,
rather
horrible
--
said
that
I
had
muddled
it
.
But
*NL*
Mrs.
Wilcox
knew
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Knew
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything
;
though
we
neither
of
us
told
her
a
word
,
*NL*
and
had
known
all
along
,
I
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
she
must
have
overheard
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
so
,
but
it
seemed
wonderful
.
When
Charles
and
*NL*
Aunt
Juley
drove
up
,
calling
each
other
names
,
Mrs.
Wilcox
*NL*
stepped
in
from
the
garden
and
made
everything
less
*NL*
terrible
.
Ugh
!
but
it
has
been
a
disgusting
business
.
To
*NL*
think
that
--
''
She
sighed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
think
that
because
you
and
a
young
man
meet
for
a
*NL*
moment
,
there
must
be
all
these
telegrams
and
anger
,
''
*NL*
supplied
Margaret
.
*NL*
*NL*
Helen
nodded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
often
thought
about
it
,
Helen
.
It
's
one
of
the
*NL*
most
interesting
things
in
the
world
.
The
truth
is
that
*NL*
there
is
a
great
outer
life
that
you
and
I
have
never
*NL*
touched
--
a
life
in
which
telegrams
and
anger
count
.
*NL*
Personal
relations
,
that
we
think
supreme
,
are
not
supreme
*NL*
there
.
There
love
means
marriage
settlements
,
death
,
death
*NL*
duties
.
So
far
I
'm
clear
.
But
here
my
difficulty
.
This
*NL*
outer
life
,
though
obviously
horrid
,
often
seems
the
real
*NL*
one
--
there
's
grit
in
it
.
It
does
breed
character
.
Do
*NL*
personal
relations
lead
to
sloppiness
in
the
end
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Meg
,
that
's
what
I
felt
,
only
not
so
clearly
,
when
*NL*
the
Wilcoxes
were
so
competent
,
and
seemed
to
have
their
*NL*
hands
on
all
the
ropes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
feel
it
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
remember
Paul
at
breakfast
,
''
said
Helen
quietly
.
``
I
*NL*
shall
never
forget
him
.
He
had
nothing
to
fall
back
upon
.
*NL*
I
know
that
personal
relations
are
the
real
life
,
for
ever
*NL*
and
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Amen
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
Wilcox
episode
fell
into
the
background
,
leaving
*NL*
behind
it
memories
of
sweetness
and
horror
that
mingled
,
and
*NL*
the
sisters
pursued
the
life
that
Helen
had
commended
.
They
*NL*
talked
to
each
other
and
to
other
people
,
they
filled
the
*NL*
tall
thin
house
at
Wickham
Place
with
those
whom
they
liked
*NL*
or
could
befriend
.
They
even
attended
public
meetings
.
In
*NL*
their
own
fashion
they
cared
deeply
about
politics
,
though
*NL*
not
as
politicians
would
have
us
care
;
they
desired
that
*NL*
public
life
should
mirror
whatever
is
good
in
the
life
*NL*
within
.
Temperance
,
tolerance
,
and
sexual
equality
were
*NL*
intelligible
cries
to
them
;
whereas
they
did
not
follow
our
*NL*
Forward
Policy
in
Thibet
with
the
keen
attention
that
it
*NL*
merits
,
and
would
at
times
dismiss
the
whole
British
Empire
*NL*
with
a
puzzled
,
if
reverent
,
sigh
.
Not
out
of
them
are
the
*NL*
shows
of
history
erected
:
the
world
would
be
a
grey
,
*NL*
bloodless
place
were
it
entirely
composed
of
Miss
*NL*
Schlegels
.
But
the
world
being
what
it
is
,
perhaps
they
*NL*
shine
out
in
it
like
stars
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
word
on
their
origin
.
They
were
not
``
English
to
the
*NL*
backbone
,
''
as
their
aunt
had
piously
asserted
.
But
,
on
the
*NL*
other
band
,
they
were
not
``
Germans
of
the
dreadful
sort
.
''
*NL*
Their
father
had
belonged
to
a
type
that
was
more
prominent
*NL*
in
Germany
fifty
years
ago
than
now
.
He
was
not
the
*NL*
aggressive
German
,
so
dear
to
the
English
journalist
,
nor
*NL*
the
domestic
German
,
so
dear
to
the
English
wit
.
If
one
*NL*
classed
him
at
all
it
would
be
as
the
countryman
of
Hegel
*NL*
and
Kant
,
as
the
idealist
,
inclined
to
be
dreamy
,
whose
*NL*
Imperialism
was
the
Imperialism
of
the
air
.
Not
that
his
*NL*
life
had
been
inactive
.
He
had
fought
like
blazes
against
*NL*
Denmark
,
Austria
,
France
.
But
he
had
fought
without
*NL*
visualizing
the
results
of
victory
.
A
hint
of
the
truth
*NL*
broke
on
him
after
Sedan
,
when
he
saw
the
dyed
moustaches
of
*NL*
Napoleon
going
grey
;
another
when
he
entered
Paris
,
and
saw
*NL*
the
smashed
windows
of
the
Tuileries
.
Peace
came
--
it
was
*NL*
all
very
immense
,
one
had
turned
into
an
Empire
--
but
he
knew
*NL*
that
some
quality
had
vanished
for
which
not
all
*NL*
Alsace-Lorraine
could
compensate
him
.
Germany
a
commercial
*NL*
Power
,
Germany
a
naval
Power
,
Germany
with
colonies
here
and
*NL*
a
Forward
Policy
there
,
and
legitimate
aspirations
in
the
*NL*
other
place
,
might
appeal
to
others
,
and
be
fitly
served
by
*NL*
them
;
for
his
own
part
,
he
abstained
from
the
fruits
of
*NL*
victory
,
and
naturalized
himself
in
England
.
The
more
*NL*
earnest
members
of
his
family
never
forgave
him
,
and
knew
*NL*
that
his
children
,
though
scarcely
English
of
the
dreadful
*NL*
sort
,
would
never
be
German
to
the
backbone
.
He
had
*NL*
obtained
work
in
one
of
our
provincial
Universities
,
and
*NL*
there
married
Poor
Emily
-LRB-
or
Die
Englanderin
as
the
case
may
*NL*
be
-RRB-
,
and
as
she
had
money
,
they
proceeded
to
London
,
and
*NL*
came
to
know
a
good
many
people
.
But
his
gaze
was
always
*NL*
fixed
beyond
the
sea
.
It
was
his
hope
that
the
clouds
of
*NL*
materialism
obscuring
the
Fatherland
would
part
in
time
,
and
*NL*
the
mild
intellectual
light
re-emerge
.
``
Do
you
imply
that
*NL*
we
Germans
are
stupid
,
Uncle
Ernst
?
''
exclaimed
a
haughty
and
*NL*
magnificent
nephew
.
Uncle
Ernst
replied
,
``
To
my
mind
.
You
*NL*
use
the
intellect
,
but
you
no
longer
care
about
it
.
That
I
*NL*
call
stupidity
.
''
As
the
haughty
nephew
did
not
follow
,
he
*NL*
continued
,
``
You
only
care
about
the
'
things
that
you
can
*NL*
use
,
and
therefore
arrange
them
in
the
following
order
:
*NL*
Money
,
supremely
useful
;
intellect
,
rather
useful
;
*NL*
imagination
,
of
no
use
at
all
.
No
''
--
for
the
other
had
*NL*
protested
--
``
your
Pan-Germanism
is
no
more
imaginative
than
*NL*
is
our
Imperialism
over
here
.
It
is
the
vice
of
a
vulgar
*NL*
mind
to
be
thrilled
by
bigness
,
to
think
that
a
thousand
*NL*
square
miles
are
a
thousand
times
more
wonderful
than
one
*NL*
square
mile
,
and
that
a
million
square
miles
are
almost
the
*NL*
same
as
heaven
.
That
is
not
imagination
.
No
,
it
kills
it
.
*NL*
When
their
poets
over
here
try
to
celebrate
bigness
they
are
*NL*
dead
at
once
,
and
naturally
.
Your
poets
too
are
dying
,
your
*NL*
philosophers
,
your
musicians
,
to
whom
Europe
has
listened
*NL*
for
two
hundred
years
.
Gone
.
Gone
with
the
little
courts
*NL*
that
nurtured
them
--
gone
with
Esterhaz
and
Weimar
.
What
?
*NL*
What
's
that
?
Your
Universities
?
Oh
,
yes
,
you
have
learned
*NL*
men
,
who
collect
more
facts
than
do
the
learned
men
of
*NL*
England
.
They
collect
facts
,
and
facts
,
and
empires
of
*NL*
facts
.
But
which
of
them
will
rekindle
the
light
within
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
all
this
Margaret
listened
,
sitting
on
the
haughty
*NL*
nephew
's
knee
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
unique
education
for
the
little
girls
.
The
*NL*
haughty
nephew
would
be
at
Wickham
Place
one
day
,
bringing
*NL*
with
him
an
even
haughtier
wife
,
both
convinced
that
Germany
*NL*
was
appointed
by
God
to
govern
the
world
.
Aunt
Juley
would
*NL*
come
the
next
day
,
convinced
that
Great
Britain
had
been
*NL*
appointed
to
the
same
post
by
the
same
authority
.
Were
both
*NL*
these
loud-voiced
parties
right
?
On
one
occasion
they
had
*NL*
met
,
and
Margaret
with
clasped
hands
had
implored
them
to
*NL*
argue
the
subject
out
in
her
presence
.
Whereat
they
*NL*
blushed
,
and
began
to
talk
about
the
weather
.
``
Papa
''
she
*NL*
cried
--
she
was
a
most
offensive
child
--
``
why
will
they
not
*NL*
discuss
this
most
clear
question
?
''
Her
father
,
surveying
*NL*
the
parties
grimly
,
replied
that
he
did
not
know
.
Putting
*NL*
her
head
on
one
side
,
Margaret
then
remarked
,
``
To
me
one
of
*NL*
two
things
is
very
clear
;
either
God
does
not
know
his
own
*NL*
mind
about
England
and
Germany
,
or
else
these
do
not
know
*NL*
the
mind
of
God
.
''
A
hateful
little
girl
,
but
at
thirteen
she
*NL*
had
grasped
a
dilemma
that
most
people
travel
through
life
*NL*
without
perceiving
.
Her
brain
darted
up
and
down
;
it
grew
*NL*
pliant
and
strong
.
Her
conclusion
was
,
that
any
human
being
*NL*
lies
nearer
to
the
unseen
than
any
organization
,
and
from
*NL*
this
she
never
varied
.
*NL*
*NL*
Helen
advanced
along
the
same
lines
,
though
with
a
more
*NL*
irresponsible
tread
.
In
character
she
resembled
her
sister
,
*NL*
but
she
was
pretty
,
and
so
apt
to
have
a
more
amusing
time
.
*NL*
People
gathered
round
her
more
readily
,
especially
when
they
*NL*
were
new
acquaintances
,
and
she
did
enjoy
a
little
homage
*NL*
very
much
.
When
their
father
died
and
they
ruled
alone
at
*NL*
Wickham
Place
,
she
often
absorbed
the
whole
of
the
company
,
*NL*
while
Margaret
--
both
were
tremendous
talkers
--
fell
flat
.
*NL*
Neither
sister
bothered
about
this
.
Helen
never
apologized
*NL*
afterwards
,
Margaret
did
not
feel
the
slightest
rancour
.
*NL*
But
looks
have
their
influence
upon
character
.
The
sisters
*NL*
were
alike
as
little
girls
,
but
at
the
time
of
the
Wilcox
*NL*
episode
their
methods
were
beginning
to
diverge
;
the
younger
*NL*
was
rather
apt
to
entice
people
,
and
,
in
enticing
them
,
to
*NL*
be
herself
enticed
;
the
elder
went
straight
ahead
,
and
*NL*
accepted
an
occasional
failure
as
part
of
the
game
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
need
be
premised
about
Tibby
.
He
was
now
an
*NL*
intelligent
man
of
sixteen
,
but
dyspeptic
and
difficile
.

*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
5
*NL*
*NL*
It
will
be
generally
admitted
that
Beethoven
's
Fifth
*NL*
Symphony
is
the
most
sublime
noise
that
has
ever
penetrated
*NL*
into
the
ear
of
man
.
All
sorts
and
conditions
are
satisfied
*NL*
by
it
.
Whether
you
are
like
Mrs.
Munt
,
and
tap
*NL*
surreptitiously
when
the
tunes
come
--
of
course
,
not
so
as
to
*NL*
disturb
the
others
--
;
or
like
Helen
,
who
can
see
heroes
and
*NL*
shipwrecks
in
the
music
's
flood
;
or
like
Margaret
,
who
can
*NL*
only
see
the
music
;
or
like
Tibby
,
who
is
profoundly
versed
*NL*
in
counterpoint
,
and
holds
the
full
score
open
on
his
knee
;
*NL*
or
like
their
cousin
,
Fraulein
Mosebach
,
who
remembers
all
*NL*
the
time
that
Beethoven
is
``
echt
Deutsch
''
;
or
like
Fraulein
*NL*
Mosebach
's
young
man
,
who
can
remember
nothing
but
Fraulein
*NL*
Mosebach
:
in
any
case
,
the
passion
of
your
life
becomes
more
*NL*
vivid
,
and
you
are
bound
to
admit
that
such
a
noise
is
cheap
*NL*
at
two
shillings
.
It
is
cheap
,
even
if
you
hear
it
in
the
*NL*
Queen
's
Hall
,
dreariest
music-room
in
London
,
though
not
as
*NL*
dreary
as
the
Free
Trade
Hall
,
Manchester
;
and
even
if
you
*NL*
sit
on
the
extreme
left
of
that
hall
,
so
that
the
brass
*NL*
bumps
at
you
before
the
rest
of
the
orchestra
arrives
,
it
is
*NL*
still
cheap
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
Margaret
talking
to
?
''
said
Mrs.
Munt
,
at
the
*NL*
conclusion
of
the
first
movement
.
She
was
again
in
London
*NL*
on
a
visit
to
Wickham
Place
.
*NL*
*NL*
Helen
looked
down
the
long
line
of
their
party
,
and
said
*NL*
that
she
did
not
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
it
be
some
young
man
or
other
whom
she
takes
an
*NL*
interest
in
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
expect
so
,
''
Helen
replied
.
Music
enwrapped
her
,
and
*NL*
she
could
not
enter
into
the
distinction
that
divides
young
*NL*
men
whom
one
takes
an
interest
in
from
young
men
whom
one
knows
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
girls
are
so
wonderful
in
always
having
--
Oh
dear
!
*NL*
one
must
n't
talk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
Andante
had
begun
--
very
beautiful
,
but
bearing
a
*NL*
family
likeness
to
all
the
other
beautiful
Andantes
that
*NL*
Beethoven
had
written
,
and
,
to
Helen
's
mind
,
rather
*NL*
disconnecting
the
heroes
and
shipwrecks
of
the
first
*NL*
movement
from
the
heroes
and
goblins
of
the
third
.
She
*NL*
heard
the
tune
through
once
,
and
then
her
attention
*NL*
wandered
,
and
she
gazed
at
the
audience
,
or
the
organ
,
or
*NL*
the
architecture
.
Much
did
she
censure
the
attenuated
*NL*
Cupids
who
encircle
the
ceiling
of
the
Queen
's
Hall
,
*NL*
inclining
each
to
each
with
vapid
gesture
,
and
clad
in
*NL*
sallow
pantaloons
,
on
which
the
October
sunlight
struck
.
*NL*
``
How
awful
to
marry
a
man
like
those
Cupids
!
''
thought
*NL*
Helen
.
Here
Beethoven
started
decorating
his
tune
,
so
she
*NL*
heard
him
through
once
more
,
and
then
she
smiled
at
her
*NL*
cousin
Frieda
.
But
Frieda
,
listening
to
Classical
Music
,
*NL*
could
not
respond
.
Herr
Liesecke
,
too
,
looked
as
if
wild
*NL*
horses
could
not
make
him
inattentive
;
there
were
lines
*NL*
across
his
forehead
,
his
lips
were
parted
,
his
pince-nez
at
*NL*
right
angles
to
his
nose
,
and
he
had
laid
a
thick
,
white
*NL*
hand
on
either
knee
.
And
next
to
her
was
Aunt
Juley
,
so
*NL*
British
,
and
wanting
to
tap
.
How
interesting
that
row
of
*NL*
people
was
!
What
diverse
influences
had
gone
to
the
*NL*
making
!
Here
Beethoven
,
after
humming
and
hawing
with
great
*NL*
sweetness
,
said
``
Heigho
,
''
and
the
Andante
came
to
an
end
.
*NL*
Applause
,
and
a
round
of
``
wunderschoning
''
and
*NL*
``
prachtvolleying
''
from
the
German
contingent
.
Margaret
*NL*
started
talking
to
her
new
young
man
;
Helen
said
to
her
*NL*
aunt
:
``
Now
comes
the
wonderful
movement
:
first
of
all
the
*NL*
goblins
,
and
then
a
trio
of
elephants
dancing
;
''
and
Tibby
*NL*
implored
the
company
generally
to
look
out
for
the
*NL*
transitional
passage
on
the
drum
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
what
,
dear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
DRUM
,
Aunt
Juley
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
look
out
for
the
part
where
you
think
you
have
done
*NL*
with
the
goblins
and
they
come
back
,
''
breathed
Helen
,
as
the
*NL*
music
started
with
a
goblin
walking
quietly
over
the
*NL*
universe
,
from
end
to
end
.
Others
followed
him
.
They
were
*NL*
not
aggressive
creatures
;
it
was
that
that
made
them
so
*NL*
terrible
to
Helen
.
They
merely
observed
in
passing
that
*NL*
there
was
no
such
thing
as
splendour
or
heroism
in
the
*NL*
world
.
After
the
interlude
of
elephants
dancing
,
they
*NL*
returned
and
made
the
observation
for
the
second
time
.
*NL*
Helen
could
not
contradict
them
,
for
,
once
at
all
events
,
*NL*
she
had
felt
the
same
,
and
had
seen
the
reliable
walls
of
*NL*
youth
collapse
.
Panic
and
emptiness
!
Panic
and
emptiness
!
*NL*
The
goblins
were
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
brother
raised
his
finger
:
it
was
the
transitional
*NL*
passage
on
the
drum
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
,
as
if
things
were
going
too
far
,
Beethoven
took
*NL*
hold
of
the
goblins
and
made
them
do
what
he
wanted
.
He
*NL*
appeared
in
person
.
He
gave
them
a
little
push
,
and
they
*NL*
began
to
walk
in
major
key
instead
of
in
a
minor
,
and
*NL*
then
--
he
blew
with
his
mouth
and
they
were
scattered
!
Gusts
*NL*
of
splendour
,
gods
and
demigods
contending
with
vast
swords
,
*NL*
colour
and
fragrance
broadcast
on
the
field
of
battle
,
*NL*
magnificent
victory
,
magnificent
death
!
Oh
,
it
all
burst
*NL*
before
the
girl
,
and
she
even
stretched
out
her
gloved
hands
*NL*
as
if
it
was
tangible
.
Any
fate
was
titanic
;
any
contest
*NL*
desirable
;
conqueror
and
conquered
would
alike
be
applauded
*NL*
by
the
angels
of
the
utmost
stars
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
goblins
--
they
had
not
really
been
there
at
all
?
*NL*
They
were
only
the
phantoms
of
cowardice
and
unbelief
?
One
*NL*
healthy
human
impulse
would
dispel
them
?
Men
like
the
*NL*
Wilcoxes
,
or
President
Roosevelt
,
would
say
yes
.
Beethoven
*NL*
knew
better
.
The
goblins
really
had
been
there
.
They
might
*NL*
return
--
and
they
did
.
It
was
as
if
the
splendour
of
life
*NL*
might
boil
over
--
and
waste
to
steam
and
froth
.
In
its
*NL*
dissolution
one
heard
the
terrible
,
ominous
note
,
and
a
*NL*
goblin
,
with
increased
malignity
,
walked
quietly
over
the
*NL*
universe
from
end
to
end
.
Panic
and
emptiness
!
Panic
and
*NL*
emptiness
!
Even
the
flaming
ramparts
of
the
world
might
fall
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beethoven
chose
to
make
all
right
in
the
end
.
He
built
*NL*
the
ramparts
up
.
He
blew
with
his
mouth
for
the
second
time
,
*NL*
and
again
the
goblins
were
scattered
.
He
brought
back
the
*NL*
gusts
of
splendour
,
the
heroism
,
the
youth
,
the
magnificence
*NL*
of
life
and
of
death
,
and
,
amid
vast
roarings
of
a
*NL*
superhuman
joy
,
he
led
his
Fifth
Symphony
to
its
*NL*
conclusion
.
But
the
goblins
were
there
.
They
could
*NL*
return
.
He
had
said
so
bravely
,
and
that
is
why
one
can
*NL*
trust
Beethoven
when
he
says
other
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
Helen
pushed
her
way
out
during
the
applause
.
She
*NL*
desired
to
be
alone
.
The
music
summed
up
to
her
all
that
*NL*
had
happened
or
could
happen
in
her
career
.
She
read
it
as
*NL*
a
tangible
statement
,
which
could
never
be
superseded
.
The
*NL*
notes
meant
this
and
that
to
her
,
and
they
could
have
no
*NL*
other
meaning
,
and
life
could
have
no
other
meaning
.
She
*NL*
pushed
right
out
of
the
building
,
and
walked
slowly
down
the
*NL*
outside
staircase
,
breathing
the
autumnal
air
,
and
then
she
*NL*
strolled
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Margaret
,
''
called
Mrs.
Munt
,
``
is
Helen
all
right
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
always
going
away
in
the
middle
of
a
programme
,
''
*NL*
said
Tibby
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
music
has
evidently
moved
her
deeply
,
''
said
*NL*
Fraulein
Mosebach
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
''
said
Margaret
's
young
man
,
who
had
for
some
*NL*
time
been
preparing
a
sentence
,
``
but
that
lady
has
,
quite
*NL*
inadvertently
,
taken
my
umbrella
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
good
gracious
me
!
--
I
am
so
sorry
.
Tibby
,
run
*NL*
after
Helen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
miss
the
Four
Serious
Songs
if
I
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tibby
love
,
you
must
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
n't
of
any
consequence
,
''
said
the
young
man
,
in
*NL*
truth
a
little
uneasy
about
his
umbrella
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
of
course
it
is
.
Tibby
!
Tibby
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tibby
rose
to
his
feet
,
and
wilfully
caught
his
person
*NL*
on
the
backs
of
the
chairs
.
By
the
time
he
had
tipped
up
*NL*
the
seat
and
had
found
his
hat
,
and
had
deposited
his
full
*NL*
score
in
safety
,
it
was
``
too
late
''
to
go
after
Helen
.
The
*NL*
Four
Serious
Songs
had
begun
,
and
one
could
not
move
during
*NL*
their
performance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
sister
is
so
careless
,
''
whispered
Margaret
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
,
''
replied
the
young
man
;
but
his
voice
was
*NL*
dead
and
cold
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
would
give
me
your
address
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
not
at
all
,
not
at
all
;
''
and
he
wrapped
his
*NL*
greatcoat
over
his
knees
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
Four
Serious
Songs
rang
shallow
in
Margaret
's
*NL*
ears
.
Brahms
,
for
all
his
grumbling
and
grizzling
,
had
*NL*
never
guessed
what
it
felt
like
to
be
suspected
of
stealing
*NL*
an
umbrella
.
For
this
fool
of
a
young
man
thought
that
she
*NL*
and
Helen
and
Tibby
had
been
playing
the
confidence
trick
on
*NL*
him
,
and
that
if
he
gave
his
address
they
would
break
into
*NL*
his
rooms
some
midnight
or
other
and
steal
his
walkingstick
*NL*
too
.
Most
ladies
would
have
laughed
,
but
Margaret
really
*NL*
minded
,
for
it
gave
her
a
glimpse
into
squalor
.
To
trust
*NL*
people
is
a
luxury
in
which
only
the
wealthy
can
indulge
;
*NL*
the
poor
can
not
afford
it
.
As
soon
as
Brahms
had
grunted
*NL*
himself
out
,
she
gave
him
her
card
and
said
,
``
That
is
where
*NL*
we
live
;
if
you
preferred
,
you
could
call
for
the
umbrella
*NL*
after
the
concert
,
but
I
did
n't
like
to
trouble
you
when
it
*NL*
has
all
been
our
fault
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
face
brightened
a
little
when
he
saw
that
Wickham
*NL*
Place
was
W
.
It
was
sad
to
see
him
corroded
with
suspicion
,
*NL*
and
yet
not
daring
to
be
impolite
,
in
case
these
*NL*
well-dressed
people
were
honest
after
all
.
She
took
it
as
a
*NL*
good
sign
that
he
said
to
her
,
``
It
's
a
fine
programme
this
*NL*
afternoon
,
is
it
not
?
''
for
this
was
the
remark
with
which
he
*NL*
had
originally
opened
,
before
the
umbrella
intervened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Beethoven
's
fine
,
''
said
Margaret
,
who
was
not
a
*NL*
female
of
the
encouraging
type
.
``
I
do
n't
like
the
Brahms
,
*NL*
though
,
nor
the
Mendelssohn
that
came
first
--
and
ugh
!
I
*NL*
do
n't
like
this
Elgar
that
's
coming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
what
?
''
called
Herr
Liesecke
,
overhearing
.
``
The
*NL*
POMP
AND
CIRCUMSTANCE
will
not
be
fine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Margaret
,
you
tiresome
girl
!
''
cried
her
aunt
.
*NL*
``
Here
have
I
been
persuading
Herr
Liesecke
to
stop
for
POMP
*NL*
AND
CIRCUMSTANCE
,
and
you
are
undoing
all
my
work
.
I
am
so
*NL*
anxious
for
him
to
hear
what
we
are
doing
in
music
.
Oh
,
you
*NL*
must
n't
run
down
our
English
composers
,
Margaret
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
my
part
,
I
have
heard
the
composition
at
Stettin
,
''
*NL*
said
Fraulein
Mosebach
.
``
On
two
occasions

It
is
dramatic
,
*NL*
a
little
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
and
he
's
a
German
.
Very
well
,
Frieda
,
you
may
go

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
lovers
laughed
and
glanced
at
each
other
.
Moved
by
*NL*
a
common
impulse
,
they
rose
to
their
feet
and
fled
from
POMP
*NL*
AND
CIRCUMSTANCE
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
this
call
to
play
in
Finsbury
Circus

is
*NL*
true

''
said
Herr
Liesecke
,
as
he
edged
past
her
and
reached
*NL*
the
gangway
just
as
the
music
started
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Margaret
--
''
loudly
whispered

Margaret

*NL*
Margaret
!
Fraulein
Mosebach
has
left
her
beautiful
little
*NL*
bag
behind
her
on
the
seat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sure
enough
,
there
was
Frieda
's
reticule
,
containing
her
*NL*
address
book
,
her
pocket
dictionary
,
her
map
of
London
,
and
*NL*
her
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
what
a
bother
--
what
a
family
we
are
!
Fr-Frieda
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
!
''
said
all
those
who
thought
the
music
fine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
's
the
number
they
want
in
Finsbury
Circus
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Might
I
--
could
n't
I
--
''
said
the
suspicious
young
man
,
*NL*
and
got
very
red
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
would
be
so
grateful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
the
bag
--
money
clinking
inside
it
--
and
slipped
*NL*
up
the
gangway
with
it
.
He
was
just
in
time
to
catch
them
*NL*
at
the
swing-door
,
and
he
received
a
pretty
smile
from
the
*NL*
German
girl
and
a
fine
bow
from
her
cavalier
.
He
returned
*NL*
to
his
seat
up-sides
with
the
world
.
The
trust
that
they
*NL*
had
reposed
in
him
was
trivial
,
but
he
felt
that
it
*NL*
cancelled
his
mistrust
for
them
,
and
that
probably
he
would
*NL*
not
be
``
had
''
over
his
umbrella
.
This
young
man
had
been
*NL*
``
had
''
in
the
past
--
badly
,
perhaps
overwhelmingly
--
and
now
*NL*
most
of
his
energies
went
in
defending
himself
against
the
*NL*
unknown
.
But
this
afternoon
--
perhaps
on
account
of
*NL*
music
--
he
perceived
that
one
must
slack
off
occasionally
,
or
*NL*
what
is
the
good
of
being
alive
?
Wickham
Place
,
W.
,
though
*NL*
a
risk
,
was
as
safe
as
most
things
,
and
he
would
risk
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
when
the
concert
was
over
and
Margaret
said
,
``
We
live
*NL*
quite
near
;
I
am
going
there
now
.
Could
you
walk
around
*NL*
with
me
,
and
we
'll
find
your
umbrella
?
''
he
said
,
``
Thank
*NL*
you
,
''
peaceably
,
and
followed
her
out
of
the
Queen
's
Hall
.
*NL*
She
wished
that
he
was
not
so
anxious
to
hand
a
lady
*NL*
downstairs
,
or
to
carry
a
lady
's
programme
for
her
--
his
*NL*
class
was
near
enough
her
own
for
its
manners
to
vex
her
.
*NL*
But
she
found
him
interesting
on
the
whole
--
every
one
*NL*
interested
the
Schlegels
on
the
whole
at
that
time
--
and
*NL*
while
her
lips
talked
culture
,
her
heart
was
planning
to
*NL*
invite
him
to
tea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
tired
one
gets
after
music
!
''
she
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
find
the
atmosphere
of
Queen
's
Hall
oppressive
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
horribly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
surely
the
atmosphere
of
Covent
Garden
is
even
more
*NL*
oppressive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
go
there
much
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
my
work
permits
,
I
attend
the
gallery
for
,
the
*NL*
Royal
Opera
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Helen
would
have
exclaimed
,
``
So
do
I.
I
love
the
*NL*
gallery
,
''
and
thus
have
endeared
herself
to
the
young
man
.
*NL*
Helen
could
do
these
things
.
But
Margaret
had
an
almost
*NL*
morbid
horror
of
``
drawing
people
out
,
''
of
``
making
things
*NL*
go
.
''
She
had
been
to
the
gallery
at
Covent
Garden
,
but
she
*NL*
did
not
``
attend
''
it
,
preferring
the
more
expensive
seats
;
*NL*
still
less
did
she
love
it
.
So
she
made
no
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
year
I
have
been
three
times
--
to
FAUST
,
TOSCA
,
*NL*
and
--
''
Was
it
``
Tannhouser
''
or
``
Tannhoyser
''
?
Better
not
risk
*NL*
the
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
disliked
TOSCA
and
FAUST
.
And
so
,
for
one
*NL*
reason
and
another
,
they
walked
on
in
silence
,
chaperoned
by
*NL*
the
voice
of
Mrs.
Munt
,
who
was
getting
into
difficulties
*NL*
with
her
nephew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
in
a
WAY
remember
the
passage
,
Tibby
,
but
when
*NL*
every
instrument
is
so
beautiful
,
it
is
difficult
to
pick
*NL*
out
one
thing
rather
than
another
.
I
am
sure
that
you
and
*NL*
Helen
take
me
to
the
very
nicest
concerts
.
Not
a
dull
note
*NL*
from
beginning
to
end
.
I
only
wish
that
our
German
friends
*NL*
would
have
stayed
till
it
finished
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
surely
you
have
n't
forgotten
the
drum
steadily
*NL*
beating
on
the
low
C
,
Aunt
Juley
?
''
came
Tibby
's
voice
.
``
No
*NL*
one
could
.
It
's
unmistakable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
specially
loud
part
?
''
hazarded
Mrs.
Munt
.
``
Of
course
*NL*
I
do
not
go
in
for
being
musical
,
''
she
added
,
the
shot
*NL*
failing
.
``
I
only
care
for
music
--
a
very
different
thing
.
*NL*
But
still
I
will
say
this
for
myself
--
I
do
know
when
I
like
*NL*
a
thing
and
when
I
do
n't
.
Some
people
are
the
same
about
*NL*
pictures
.
They
can
go
into
a
picture
gallery
--
Miss
Conder
*NL*
can
--
and
say
straight
off
what
they
feel
,
all
round
the
*NL*
wall
.
I
never
could
do
that
.
But
music
is
so
different
to
*NL*
pictures
,
to
my
mind
.
When
it
comes
to
music
I
am
as
safe
*NL*
as
houses
,
and
I
assure
you
,
Tibby
,
I
am
by
no
means
pleased
*NL*
by
everything
.
There
was
a
thing
--
something
about
a
faun
in
*NL*
French
--
which
Helen
went
into
ecstasies
over
,
but
I
thought
*NL*
it
most
tinkling
and
superficial
,
and
said
so
,
and
I
held
to
*NL*
my
opinion
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
agree
?
''
asked
Margaret
.
``
Do
you
think
music
is
*NL*
so
different
to
pictures
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
--
I
should
have
thought
so
,
kind
of
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
should
I.
Now
,
my
sister
declares
they
're
just
the
*NL*
same
.
We
have
great
arguments
over
it
.
She
says
I
'm
dense
;
*NL*
I
say
she
's
sloppy
.
''
Getting
under
way
,
she
cried
:
``
Now
,
*NL*
does
n't
it
seem
absurd
to
you
?
What
is
the
good
of
the
Arts
*NL*
if
they
are
interchangeable
?
What
is
the
good
of
the
ear
if
*NL*
it
tells
you
the
same
as
the
eye
?
Helen
's
one
aim
is
to
*NL*
translate
tunes
into
the
language
of
painting
,
and
pictures
*NL*
into
the
language
of
music
.
It
's
very
ingenious
,
and
she
*NL*
says
several
pretty
things
in
the
process
,
but
what
's
*NL*
gained
,
I
'd
like
to
know
?
Oh
,
it
's
all
rubbish
,
radically
*NL*
false
.
If
Monet
's
really
Debussy
,
and
Debussy
's
really
*NL*
Monet
,
neither
gentleman
is
worth
his
salt
--
that
's
my
opinion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Evidently
these
sisters
quarrelled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
this
very
symphony
that
we
've
just
been
*NL*
having
--
she
wo
n't
let
it
alone
.
She
labels
it
with
meanings
*NL*
from
start
to
finish
;
turns
it
into
literature
.
I
wonder
if
*NL*
the
day
will
ever
return
when
music
will
be
treated
as
*NL*
music
.
Yet
I
do
n't
know
.
There
's
my
brother
--
behind
us
.
*NL*
He
treats
music
as
music
,
and
oh
,
my
goodness
!
He
makes
me
*NL*
angrier
than
anyone
,
simply
furious
.
With
him
I
dare
n't
*NL*
even
argue
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
An
unhappy
family
,
if
talented
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
of
course
,
the
real
villain
is
Wagner
.
He
has
*NL*
done
more
than
any
man
in
the
nineteenth
century
towards
the
*NL*
muddling
of
arts
.
I
do
feel
that
music
is
in
a
very
serious
*NL*
state
just
now
,
though
extraordinarily
interesting
.
Every
*NL*
now
and
then
in
history
there
do
come
these
terrible
*NL*
geniuses
,
like
Wagner
,
who
stir
up
all
the
wells
of
thought
*NL*
at
once
.
For
a
moment
it
's
splendid
.
Such
a
splash
as
*NL*
never
was
.
But
afterwards
--
such
a
lot
of
mud
;
and
the
*NL*
wells
--
as
it
were
,
they
communicate
with
each
other
too
*NL*
easily
now
,
and
not
one
of
them
will
run
quite
clear
.
*NL*
That
's
what
Wagner
's
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
speeches
fluttered
away
from
the
young
man
like
*NL*
birds
.
If
only
he
could
talk
like
this
,
he
would
have
*NL*
caught
the
world
.
Oh
to
acquire
culture
!
Oh
,
to
pronounce
*NL*
foreign
names
correctly
!
Oh
,
to
be
well
informed
,
*NL*
discoursing
at
ease
on
every
subject
that
a
lady
started
!
*NL*
But
it
would
take
one
years
.
With
an
hour
at
lunch
and
a
*NL*
few
shattered
hours
in
the
evening
,
how
was
it
possible
to
*NL*
catch
up
with
leisured
women
,
who
had
been
reading
steadily
*NL*
from
childhood
?
His
brain
might
be
full
of
names
,
he
might
*NL*
have
even
heard
of
Monet
and
Debussy
;
the
trouble
was
that
*NL*
he
could
not
string
them
together
into
a
sentence
,
he
could
*NL*
not
make
them
``
tell
,
''
he
could
not
quite
forget
about
his
*NL*
stolen
umbrella
.
Yes
,
the
umbrella
was
the
real
trouble
.
*NL*
Behind
Monet
and
Debussy
the
umbrella
persisted
,
with
the
*NL*
steady
beat
of
a
drum
.
``
I
suppose
my
umbrella
will
be
all
*NL*
right
,
''
he
was
thinking
.
``
I
do
n't
really
mind
about
it
.
I
*NL*
will
think
about
music
instead
.
I
suppose
my
umbrella
will
*NL*
be
all
right
.
''
Earlier
in
the
afternoon
he
had
worried
about
*NL*
seats
.
Ought
he
to
have
paid
as
much
as
two
shillings
?
*NL*
Earlier
still
he
had
wondered
,
``
Shall
I
try
to
do
without
a
*NL*
programme
?
''
There
had
always
been
something
to
worry
him
*NL*
ever
since
he
could
remember
,
always
something
that
*NL*
distracted
him
in
the
pursuit
of
beauty
.
For
he
did
pursue
*NL*
beauty
,
and
therefore
,
Margaret
's
speeches
did
flutter
away
*NL*
from
him
like
birds
.
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
talked
ahead
,
occasionally
saying
,
``
Do
n't
you
*NL*
think
so
?
do
n't
you
feel
the
same
?
''
And
once
she
stopped
,
*NL*
and
said
``
Oh
,
do
interrupt
me
!
''
which
terrified
him
.
She
*NL*
did
not
attract
him
,
though
she
filled
him
with
awe
.
Her
*NL*
figure
was
meagre
,
her
face
seemed
all
teeth
and
eyes
,
her
*NL*
references
to
her
sister
and
brother
were
uncharitable
.
For
*NL*
all
her
cleverness
and
culture
,
she
was
probably
one
of
*NL*
those
soulless
,
atheistical
women
who
have
been
so
shown
up
*NL*
by
Miss
Corelli
.
It
was
surprising
-LRB-
and
alarming
-RRB-
that
she
*NL*
should
suddenly
say
,
``
I
do
hope
that
you
'll
come
in
and
have
*NL*
some
tea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
hope
that
you
'll
come
in
and
have
some
tea
.
We
*NL*
should
be
so
glad
.
I
have
dragged
you
so
far
out
of
your
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
arrived
at
Wickham
Place
.
The
sun
had
set
,
and
*NL*
the
backwater
,
in
deep
shadow
,
was
filling
with
a
gentle
*NL*
haze
.
To
the
right
of
the
fantastic
skyline
of
the
flats
*NL*
towered
black
against
the
hues
of
evening
;
to
the
left
the
*NL*
older
houses
raised
a
square-cut
,
irregular
parapet
against
*NL*
the
grey
.
Margaret
fumbled
for
her
latchkey
.
Of
course
she
*NL*
had
forgotten
it
.
So
,
grasping
her
umbrella
by
its
ferrule
,
*NL*
she
leant
over
the
area
and
tapped
at
the
dining-room
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Helen
!
Let
us
in
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
said
a
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
been
taking
this
gentleman
's
umbrella
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Taken
a
what
?
''
said
Helen
,
opening
the
door
.
``
Oh
,
*NL*
what
's
that
?
Do
come
in
!
How
do
you
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Helen
,
you
must
not
be
so
ramshackly
.
You
took
this
*NL*
gentleman
's
umbrella
away
from
Queen
's
Hall
,
and
he
has
had
*NL*
the
trouble
of
coming
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
am
so
sorry
!
''
cried
Helen
,
all
her
hair
flying
.
*NL*
She
had
pulled
off
her
hat
as
soon
as
she
returned
,
and
had
*NL*
flung
herself
into
the
big
dining-room
chair
.
``
I
do
nothing
*NL*
but
steal
umbrellas
.
I
am
so
very
sorry
!
Do
come
in
and
*NL*
choose
one
.
Is
yours
a
hooky
or
a
nobbly
?
Mine
's
a
*NL*
nobbly
--
at
least
,
I
THINK
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
light
was
turned
on
,
and
they
began
to
search
the
*NL*
hall
,
Helen
,
who
had
abruptly
parted
with
the
Fifth
*NL*
Symphony
,
commenting
with
shrill
little
cries
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
talk
,
Meg
!
You
stole
an
old
gentleman
's
silk
*NL*
top-hat
.
Yes
,
she
did
,
Aunt
Juley
.
It
is
a
positive
fact
.
*NL*
She
thought
it
was
a
muff
.
Oh
,
heavens
!
I
've
knocked
the
*NL*
In
and
Out
card
down
.
Where
's
Frieda
?
Tibby
,
why
do
n't
you
*NL*
ever
--
No
,
I
ca
n't
remember
what
I
was
going
to
say
.
That
*NL*
was
n't
it
,
but
do
tell
the
maids
to
hurry
tea
up
.
What
*NL*
about
this
umbrella
?
''
She
opened
it
.
``
No
,
it
's
all
gone
*NL*
along
the
seams
.
It
's
an
appalling
umbrella
.
It
must
be
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
it
from
her
,
murmured
a
few
words
of
thanks
,
and
*NL*
then
fled
,
with
the
lilting
step
of
the
clerk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
you
will
stop
--
''
cried
Margaret
.
``
Now
,
Helen
,
*NL*
how
stupid
you
've
been
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whatever
have
I
done
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
see
that
you
've
frightened
him
away
?
I
meant
*NL*
him
to
stop
to
tea
.
You
ought
n't
to
talk
about
stealing
or
*NL*
holes
in
an
umbrella
.
I
saw
his
nice
eyes
getting
so
*NL*
miserable
.
No
,
it
's
not
a
bit
of
good
now
.
''
For
Helen
had
*NL*
darted
out
into
the
street
,
shouting
,
``
Oh
,
do
stop
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dare
say
it
is
all
for
the
best
,
''
opined
Mrs.
Munt
.
*NL*
``
We
know
nothing
about
the
young
man
,
Margaret
,
and
your
*NL*
drawing-room
is
full
of
very
tempting
little
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Helen
cried
:
``
Aunt
Juley
,
how
can
you
!
You
make
me
*NL*
more
and
more
ashamed
.
I
'd
rather
he
HAD
been
a
thief
and
*NL*
taken
all
the
apostle
spoons
than
that
I
--
Well
,
I
must
shut
*NL*
the
front-door
,
I
suppose
.
One
more
failure
for
Helen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
think
the
apostle
spoons
could
have
gone
as
*NL*
rent
,
''
said
Margaret
.
Seeing
that
her
aunt
did
not
*NL*
understand
,
she
added
:
``
You
remember
`
rent
.
'
It
was
one
of
*NL*
father
's
words
--
Rent
to
the
ideal
,
to
his
own
faith
in
human
*NL*
nature
.
You
remember
how
he
would
trust
strangers
,
and
if
*NL*
they
fooled
him
he
would
say
,
`
It
's
better
to
be
fooled
than
*NL*
to
be
suspicious
'
--
that
the
confidence
trick
is
the
work
of
*NL*
man
,
but
the
want-of-confidence-trick
is
the
work
of
the
devil
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
remember
something
of
the
sort
now
,
''
said
Mrs.
Munt
,
*NL*
rather
tartly
,
for
she
longed
to
add
,
``
It
was
lucky
that
*NL*
your
father
married
a
wife
with
money
.
''
But
this
was
unkind
,
*NL*
and
she
contented
herself
with
,
``
Why
,
he
might
have
stolen
*NL*
the
little
Ricketts
picture
as
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Better
that
he
had
,
''
said
Helen
stoutly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
agree
with
Aunt
Juley
,
''
said
Margaret
.
``
I
'd
*NL*
rather
mistrust
people
than
lose
my
little
Ricketts
.
There
*NL*
are
limits
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Their
brother
,
finding
the
incident
commonplace
,
had
*NL*
stolen
upstairs
to
see
whether
there
were
scones
for
tea
.
*NL*
He
warmed
the
teapot
--
almost
too
deftly
--
rejected
the
Orange
*NL*
Pekoe
that
the
parlour-maid
had
provided
,
poured
in
five
*NL*
spoonfuls
of
a
superior
blend
,
filled
up
with
really
boiling
*NL*
water
,
and
now
called
to
the
ladies
to
be
quick
or
they
*NL*
would
lose
the
aroma
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
Auntie
Tibby
,
''
called
Helen
,
while
Margaret
,
*NL*
thoughtful
again
,
said
:
``
In
a
way
,
I
wish
we
had
a
real
boy
*NL*
in
the
house
--
the
kind
of
boy
who
cares
for
men
.
It
would
*NL*
make
entertaining
so
much
easier
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
do
I
,
''
said
her
sister
.
``
Tibby
only
cares
for
*NL*
cultured
females
singing
Brahms
.
''
And
when
they
joined
him
*NL*
she
said
rather
sharply
:
``
Why
did
n't
you
make
that
young
man
*NL*
welcome
,
Tibby
?
You
must
do
the
host
a
little
,
you
know
.
*NL*
You
ought
to
have
taken
his
hat
and
coaxed
him
into
*NL*
stopping
,
instead
of
letting
him
be
swamped
by
screaming
women
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tibby
sighed
,
and
drew
a
long
strand
of
hair
over
his
forehead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
's
no
good
looking
superior
.
I
mean
what
I
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
Tibby
alone
!
''
said
Margaret
,
who
could
not
bear
*NL*
her
brother
to
be
scolded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
's
the
house
a
regular
hen-coop
!
''
grumbled
Helen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
dear
!
''
protested
Mrs.
Munt
.
``
How
can
you
say
*NL*
such
dreadful
things
!
The
number
of
men
you
get
here
has
*NL*
always
astonished
me
.
If
there
is
any
danger
it
's
the
other
*NL*
way
round
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
it
's
the
wrong
sort
of
men
,
Helen
means
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
n't
,
''
corrected
Helen
.
``
We
get
the
right
sort
*NL*
of
man
,
but
the
wrong
side
of
him
,
and
I
say
that
's
Tibby
's
*NL*
fault
.
There
ought
to
be
a
something
about
the
house
--
an
--
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
what
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
touch
of
the
W.
's
,
perhaps
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Helen
put
out
her
tongue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
are
the
W.
's
?
''
asked
Tibby
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
W.
's
are
things
I
and
Meg
and
Aunt
Juley
know
about
*NL*
and
you
do
n't
,
so
there
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
that
ours
is
a
female
house
,
''
said
Margaret
,
*NL*
``
and
one
must
just
accept
it
.
No
,
Aunt
Juley
,
I
do
n't
mean
*NL*
that
this
house
is
full
of
women
.
I
am
trying
to
say
*NL*
something
much
more
clever
.
I
mean
that
it
was
irrevocably
*NL*
feminine
,
even
in
father
's
time
.
Now
I
'm
sure
you
*NL*
understand
!
Well
,
I
'll
give
you
another
example
.
It
'll
*NL*
shock
you
,
but
I
do
n't
care
.
Suppose
Queen
Victoria
gave
a
*NL*
dinner-party
,
and
that
the
guests
had
been
Leighton
,
*NL*
Millais
,
Swinburne
,
Rossetti
,
Meredith
,
Fitzgerald
,
etc.
.
Do
*NL*
you
suppose
that
the
atmosphere
of
that
dinner
would
have
*NL*
been
artistic
?
Heavens
no
!
The
very
chairs
on
which
they
*NL*
sat
would
have
seen
to
that
.
So
with
our
house
--
it
must
be
*NL*
feminine
,
and
all
we
can
do
is
to
see
that
it
is
n't
*NL*
effeminate
.
Just
as
another
house
that
I
can
mention
,
but
I
*NL*
wo
n't
,
sounded
irrevocably
masculine
,
and
all
its
inmates
*NL*
can
do
is
to
see
that
it
is
n't
brutal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
house
being
the
W.
's
house
,
I
presume
,
''
said
Tibby
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
not
going
to
be
told
about
the
W.
's
,
my
child
,
''
*NL*
Helen
cried
,
``
so
do
n't
you
think
it
.
And
on
the
other
hand
,
*NL*
I
do
n't
the
least
mind
if
you
find
out
,
so
do
n't
you
think
*NL*
you
've
done
anything
clever
,
in
either
case
.
Give
me
a
cigarette
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
what
you
can
for
the
house
,
''
said
Margaret
.
*NL*
``
The
drawing-room
reeks
of
smoke
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
smoked
too
,
the
house
might
suddenly
turn
*NL*
masculine
.
Atmosphere
is
probably
a
question
of
touch
and
*NL*
go
.
Even
at
Queen
Victoria
's
dinner-party
--
if
something
had
*NL*
been
just
a
little
different
--
perhaps
if
she
'd
worn
a
*NL*
clinging
Liberty
tea-gown
instead
of
a
magenta
satin
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
an
Indian
shawl
over
her
shoulders
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fastened
at
the
bosom
with
a
Cairngorm-pin
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bursts
of
disloyal
laughter
--
you
must
remember
that
they
*NL*
are
half
German
--
greeted
these
suggestions
,
and
Margaret
*NL*
said
pensively
,
``
How
inconceivable
it
would
be
if
the
Royal
*NL*
Family
cared
about
Art
.
''
And
the
conversation
drifted
away
*NL*
and
away
,
and
Helen
's
cigarette
turned
to
a
spot
in
the
*NL*
darkness
,
and
the
great
flats
opposite
were
sown
with
*NL*
lighted
windows
,
which
vanished
and
were
relit
again
,
and
*NL*
vanished
incessantly
.
Beyond
them
the
thoroughfare
roared
*NL*
gently
--
a
tide
that
could
never
be
quiet
,
while
in
the
east
,
*NL*
invisible
behind
the
smokes
of
Wapping
,
the
moon
was
rising
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
reminds
me
,
Margaret
.
We
might
have
taken
that
*NL*
young
man
into
the
dining-room
,
at
all
events
.
Only
the
*NL*
majolica
plate
--
and
that
is
so
firmly
set
in
the
wall
.
I
am
*NL*
really
distressed
that
he
had
no
tea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
that
little
incident
had
impressed
the
three
women
*NL*
more
than
might
be
supposed
.
It
remained
as
a
goblin
*NL*
football
,
as
a
hint
that
all
is
not
for
the
best
in
the
best
*NL*
of
all
possible
worlds
,
and
that
beneath
these
*NL*
superstructures
of
wealth
and
art
there
wanders
an
ill-fed
*NL*
boy
,
who
has
recovered
his
umbrella
indeed
,
but
who
has
left
*NL*
no
address
behind
him
,
and
no
name

*NL*
Chapter
6
*NL*
*NL*
We
are
not
concerned
with
the
very
poor
.
They
are
*NL*
unthinkable
,
and
only
to
be
approached
by
the
statistician
*NL*
or
the
poet
.
This
story
deals
with
gentlefolk
,
or
with
*NL*
those
who
are
obliged
to
pretend
that
they
are
gentlefolk
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
,
Leonard
Bast
,
stood
at
the
extreme
verge
of
*NL*
gentility
.
He
was
not
in
the
abyss
,
but
he
could
see
it
,
*NL*
and
at
times
people
whom
he
knew
had
dropped
in
,
and
counted
*NL*
no
more
.
He
knew
that
he
was
poor
,
and
would
admit
it
:
he
*NL*
would
have
died
sooner
than
confess
any
inferiority
to
the
*NL*
rich
.
This
may
be
splendid
of
him
.
But
he
was
inferior
to
*NL*
most
rich
people
,
there
is
not
the
least
doubt
of
it
.
He
*NL*
was
not
as
courteous
as
the
average
rich
man
,
nor
as
*NL*
intelligent
,
nor
as
healthy
,
nor
as
lovable
.
His
mind
and
*NL*
his
body
had
been
alike
underfed
,
because
he
was
poor
,
and
*NL*
because
he
was
modern
they
were
always
craving
better
food
.
*NL*
Had
he
lived
some
centuries
ago
,
in
the
brightly
coloured
*NL*
civilizations
of
the
past
,
he
would
have
had
a
definite
*NL*
status
,
his
rank
and
his
income
would
have
corresponded
.
*NL*
But
in
his
day
the
angel
of
Democracy
had
arisen
,
*NL*
enshadowing
the
classes
with
leathern
wings
,
and
*NL*
proclaiming
,
``
All
men
are
equal
--
all
men
,
that
is
to
say
,
*NL*
who
possess
umbrellas
,
''
and
so
he
was
obliged
to
assert
*NL*
gentility
,
lest
he
slipped
into
the
abyss
where
nothing
*NL*
counts
,
and
the
statements
of
Democracy
are
inaudible
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
walked
away
from
Wickham
Place
,
his
first
care
was
*NL*
to
prove
that
he
was
as
good
as
the
Miss
Schlegels
.
*NL*
Obscurely
wounded
in
his
pride
,
he
tried
to
wound
them
in
*NL*
return
.
They
were
probably
not
ladies
.
Would
real
ladies
*NL*
have
asked
him
to
tea
?
They
were
certainly
ill-natured
and
*NL*
cold
.
At
each
step
his
feeling
of
superiority
increased
.
*NL*
Would
a
real
lady
have
talked
about
stealing
an
umbrella
?
*NL*
Perhaps
they
were
thieves
after
all
,
and
if
he
had
gone
into
*NL*
the
house
they
could
have
clapped
a
chloroformed
*NL*
handkerchief
over
his
face
.
He
walked
on
complacently
as
*NL*
far
as
the
Houses
of
Parliament
.
There
an
empty
stomach
*NL*
asserted
itself
,
and
told
him
he
was
a
fool
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Evening
,
Mr.
Bast
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``

Dealtry

*NL*

''

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Dealtry
,
a
fellow
clerk
,
passed
on
,
and
Leonard
*NL*
stood
wondering
whether
he
would
take
the
tram
as
far
as
a
*NL*
penny
would
take
him
,
or
whether
he
would
walk
.
He
decided
*NL*
to
walk
--
it
is
no
good
giving
in
,
and
he
had
spent
money
*NL*
enough
at
Queen
's
Hall
--
and
he
walked
over
Westminster
*NL*
Bridge
,
in
front
of
St.
Thomas
's
Hospital
,
and
through
the
*NL*
immense
tunnel
that
passes
under
the
South-Western
main
line
*NL*
at
Vauxhall
.
In
the
tunnel
he
paused
and
listened
to
the
*NL*
roar
of
the
trains
.
A
sharp
pain
darted
through
his
head
,
*NL*
and
he
was
conscious
of
the
exact
form
of
his
eye
sockets
.
*NL*
He
pushed
on
for
another
mile
,
and
did
not
slacken
speed
*NL*
until
he
stood
at
the
entrance
of
a
road
called
Camelia
*NL*
Road
,
which
was
at
present
his
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
he
stopped
again
,
and
glanced
suspiciously
to
right
*NL*
and
left
,
like
a
rabbit
that
is
going
to
bolt
into
its
*NL*
hole
.
A
block
of
flats
,
constructed
with
extreme
cheapness
,
*NL*
towered
on
either
hand
.
Farther
down
the
road
two
more
*NL*
blocks
were
being
built
,
and
beyond
these
an
old
house
was
*NL*
being
demolished
to
accommodate
another
pair
.
It
was
the
*NL*
kind
of
scene
that
may
be
observed
all
over
London
,
whatever
*NL*
the
locality
--
bricks
and
mortar
rising
and
falling
with
the
*NL*
restlessness
of
the
water
in
a
fountain
,
as
the
city
*NL*
receives
more
and
more
men
upon
her
soil
.
Camelia
Road
*NL*
would
soon
stand
out
like
a
fortress
,
and
command
,
for
a
*NL*
little
,
an
extensive
view
.
Only
for
a
little
.
Plans
were
*NL*
out
for
the
erection
of
flats
in
Magnolia
Road
also
.
And
*NL*
again
a
few
years
,
and
all
the
flats
in
either
road
might
be
*NL*
pulled
down
,
and
new
buildings
,
of
a
vastness
at
present
*NL*
unimaginable
,
might
arise
where
they
had
fallen

,
Mr.
Cunningham

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
serious
thing
this
decline
of
the
birth-rate
in
*NL*
Manchester
,
''
repeated
Mr.
Cunningham
,
tapping
the
Sunday
*NL*
paper
,
in
which
the
calamity
in
question
had
just
been
*NL*
announced
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
yes
,
''
said
Leonard
,
who
was
not
going
to
let
on
*NL*
that
he
had
not
bought
a
Sunday
paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
this
kind
of
thing
goes
on
the
population
of
England
*NL*
will
be
stationary
in
1960

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
say
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
call
it
a
very
serious
thing
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-evening
,
Mr.
Cunningham
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-evening
,
Mr.
Bast
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Leonard
entered
Block
B
of
the
flats
,
and
turned
,
*NL*
not
upstairs
,
but
down
,
into
what
is
known
to
house
agents
*NL*
as
a
semi-basement
,
and
to
other
men
as
a
cellar
.
He
opened
*NL*
the
door
,
and
cried
``
Hullo
!
''
with
the
pseudo-geniality
of
*NL*
the
Cockney
.
There
was
no
reply
.
``
Hullo
!
''
he
repeated
.
*NL*
The
sitting-room
was
empty
,
though
the
electric
light
had
*NL*
been
left
burning
.
A
look
of
relief
came
over
his
face
,
and
*NL*
he
flung
himself
into
the
armchair
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sitting-room
contained
,
besides
the
armchair
,
two
*NL*
other
chairs
,
a
piano
,
a
three-legged
table
,
and
a
cosy
*NL*
corner
.
Of
the
walls
,
one
was
occupied
by
the
window
,
the
*NL*
other
by
a
draped
mantelshelf
bristling
with
Cupids
.
*NL*
Opposite
the
window
was
the
door
,
and
beside
the
door
a
*NL*
bookcase
,
while
over
the
piano
there
extended
one
of
the
*NL*
masterpieces
of
Maud
Goodman
.
It
was
an
amorous
and
not
*NL*
unpleasant
little
hole
when
the
curtains
were
drawn
,
and
the
*NL*
lights
turned
on
,
and
the
gas-stove
unlit
.
But
it
struck
*NL*
that
shallow
makeshift
note
that
is
so
often
heard
in
the
*NL*
modem
dwelling-place
.
It
had
been
too
easily
gained
,
and
*NL*
could
be
relinquished
too
easily
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Leonard
was
kicking
off
his
boots
he
jarred
the
*NL*
three-legged
table
,
and
a
photograph
frame
,
honourably
*NL*
poised
upon
it
,
slid
sideways
,
fell
off
into
the
fireplace
,
*NL*
and
smashed
.
He
swore
in
a
colourless
sort
of
way
,
and
*NL*
picked
the
photograph
up
.
It
represented
a
young
lady
*NL*
called
Jacky
,
and
had
been
taken
at
the
time
when
young
*NL*
ladies
called
Jacky
were
often
photographed
with
their
*NL*
mouths
open
.
Teeth
of
dazzling
whiteness
extended
along
*NL*
either
of
Jacky
's
jaws
,
and
positively
weighted
her
head
*NL*
sideways
,
so
large
were
they
and
so
numerous
.
Take
my
word
*NL*
for
it
,
that
smile
was
simply
stunning
,
and
it
is
only
you
*NL*
and
I
who
will
be
fastidious
,
and
complain
that
true
joy
*NL*
begins
in
the
eyes
,
and
that
the
eyes
of
Jacky
did
not
*NL*
accord
with
her
smile
,
but
were
anxious
and
hungry
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leonard
tried
to
pull
out
the
fragments
of
glass
,
and
*NL*
cut
his
fingers
and
swore
again
.
A
drop
of
blood
fell
on
*NL*
the
frame
,
another
followed
,
spilling
over
on
to
the
exposed
*NL*
photograph
.
He
swore
more
vigorously
,
and
dashed
to
the
*NL*
kitchen
,
where
he
bathed
his
hands
.
The
kitchen
was
the
*NL*
same
size
as
the
sitting
room
;
through
it
was
a
bedroom
.
*NL*
This
completed
his
home
.
He
was
renting
the
flat
furnished
:
*NL*
of
all
the
objects
that
encumbered
it
none
were
his
own
*NL*
except
the
photograph
frame
,
the
Cupids
,
and
the
books
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Damn
,
damn
,
damnation
!
''
he
murmured
,
together
with
such
*NL*
other
words
as
he
had
learnt
from
older
men
.
Then
he
raised
*NL*
his
hand
to
his
forehead
and
said
,
``
Oh
,
damn
it
all
--
''
which
*NL*
meant
something
different
.
He
pulled
himself
together
.
He
*NL*
drank
a
little
tea
,
black
and
silent
,
that
still
survived
*NL*
upon
an
upper
shelf
.
He
swallowed
some
dusty
crumbs
of
*NL*
cake
.
Then
he
went
back
to
the
sitting-room
,
settled
*NL*
himself
anew
,
and
began
to
read
a
volume
of
Ruskin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Seven
miles
to
the
north
of
Venice
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
How
perfectly
the
famous
chapter
opens
!
How
supreme
its
*NL*
command
of
admonition
and
of
poetry
!
The
rich
man
is
*NL*
speaking
to
us
from
his
gondola
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Seven
miles
to
the
north
of
Venice
the
banks
of
sand
*NL*
which
nearer
the
city
rise
little
above
low-water
mark
*NL*
attain
by
degrees
a
higher
level
,
and
knit
themselves
at
*NL*
last
into
fields
of
salt
morass
,
raised
here
and
there
into
*NL*
shapeless
mounds
,
and
intercepted
by
narrow
creeks
of
sea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Leonard
was
trying
to
form
his
style
on
Ruskin
:
he
*NL*
understood
him
to
be
the
greatest
master
of
English
Prose
.
*NL*
He
read
forward
steadily
,
occasionally
making
a
few
notes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
consider
a
little
each
of
these
characters
in
*NL*
succession
,
and
first
-LRB-
for
of
the
shafts
enough
has
been
*NL*
said
already
-RRB-
,
what
is
very
peculiar
to
this
church
--
its
luminousness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Was
there
anything
to
be
learnt
from
this
fine
*NL*
sentence
?
Could
he
adapt
it
to
the
needs
of
daily
life
?
*NL*
Could
he
introduce
it
,
with
modifications
,
when
he
next
*NL*
wrote
a
letter
to
his
brother
,
the
lay-reader
?
For
example
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
consider
a
little
each
of
these
characters
in
*NL*
succession
,
and
first
-LRB-
for
of
the
absence
of
ventilation
*NL*
enough
has
been
said
already
-RRB-
,
what
is
very
peculiar
to
this
*NL*
flat
--
its
obscurity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Something
told
him
that
the
modifications
would
not
do
;
*NL*
and
that
something
,
had
he
known
it
,
was
the
spirit
of
*NL*
English
Prose
.
``
My
flat
is
dark
as
well
as
stuffy
.
''
Those
*NL*
were
the
words
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
voice
in
the
gondola
rolled
on
,
piping
*NL*
melodiously
of
Effort
and
Self-Sacrifice
,
full
of
high
*NL*
purpose
,
full
of
beauty
,
full
even
of
sympathy
and
the
love
*NL*
of
men
,
yet
somehow
eluding
all
that
was
actual
and
*NL*
insistent
in
Leonard
's
life
.
For
it
was
the
voice
of
one
*NL*
who
had
never
been
dirty
or
hungry
,
and
had
not
guessed
*NL*
successfully
what
dirt
and
hunger
are
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leonard
listened
to
it
with
reverence
.
He
felt
that
he
*NL*
was
being
done
good
to
,
and
that
if
he
kept
on
with
Ruskin
,
*NL*
and
the
Queen
's
Hall
Concerts
,
and
some
pictures
by
Watts
,
*NL*
he
would
one
day
push
his
head
out
of
the
grey
waters
and
*NL*
see
the
universe
.
He
believed
in
sudden
conversion
,
a
*NL*
belief
which
may
be
right
,
but
which
is
peculiarly
*NL*
attractive
to
a
half-baked
mind
.
It
is
the
bias
of
much
*NL*
popular
religion
:
in
the
domain
of
business
it
dominates
the
*NL*
Stock
Exchange
,
and
becomes
that
``
bit
of
luck
''
by
which
all
*NL*
successes
and
failures
are
explained
.
``
If
only
I
had
a
bit
*NL*
of
luck
,
the
whole
thing
would
come
straight
...
He
's
*NL*
got
a
most
magnificent
place
down
at
Streatham
and
a
20
*NL*
h.-p
.
Fiat
,
but
then
,
mind
you
,
he
's
had
luck
...
I
'm
*NL*
sorry
the
wife
's
so
late
,
but
she
never
has
any
luck
over
*NL*
catching
trains
.
''
Leonard
was
superior
to
these
people
;
he
*NL*
did
believe
in
effort
and
in
a
steady
preparation
for
the
*NL*
change
that
he
desired
.
But
of
a
heritage
that
may
expand
*NL*
gradually
,
he
had
no
conception
:
he
hoped
to
come
to
Culture
*NL*
suddenly
,
much
as
the
Revivalist
hopes
to
come
to
Jesus
.
*NL*
Those
Miss
Schlegels
had
come
to
it
;
they
had
done
the
*NL*
trick
;
their
hands
were
upon
the
ropes
,
once
and
for
all
.
*NL*
And
meanwhile
,
his
flat
was
dark
,
as
well
as
stuffy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
there
was
a
noise
on
the
staircase
.
He
shut
*NL*
up
Margaret
's
card
in
the
pages
of
Ruskin
,
and
opened
the
*NL*
door
.
A
woman
entered
,
of
whom
it
is
simplest
to
say
that
*NL*
she
was
not
respectable
.
Her
appearance
was
awesome
.
She
*NL*
seemed
all
strings
and
bell-pulls
--
ribbons
,
chains
,
bead
*NL*
necklaces
that
clinked
and
caught
--
and
a
boa
of
azure
*NL*
feathers
hung
round
her
neck
,
with
the
ends
uneven
.
Her
*NL*
throat
was
bare
,
wound
with
a
double
row
of
pearls
,
her
arms
*NL*
were
bare
to
the
elbows
,
and
might
again
be
detected
at
the
*NL*
shoulder
,
through
cheap
lace
.
Her
hat
,
which
was
flowery
,
*NL*
resembled
those
punnets
,
covered
with
flannel
,
which
we
*NL*
sowed
with
mustard
and
cress
in
our
childhood
,
and
which
*NL*
germinated
here
yes
,
and
there
no
.
She
wore
it
on
the
back
*NL*
of
her
head
.
As
for
her
hair
,
or
rather
hairs
,
they
are
too
*NL*
complicated
to
describe
,
but
one
system
went
down
her
back
,
*NL*
lying
in
a
thick
pad
there
,
while
another
,
created
for
a
*NL*
lighter
destiny
,
rippled
around
her
forehead
.
The
face
--
the
*NL*
face
does
not
signify
.
It
was
the
face
of
the
photograph
,
*NL*
but
older
,
and
the
teeth
were
not
so
numerous
as
the
*NL*
photographer
had
suggested
,
and
certainly
not
so
white
.
*NL*
Yes
,
Jacky
was
past
her
prime
,
whatever
that
prime
may
have
*NL*
been
.
She
was
descending
quicker
than
most
women
into
the
*NL*
colourless
years
,
and
the
look
in
her
eyes
confessed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
ho
!
''
said
Leonard
,
greeting
that
apparition
with
*NL*
much
spirit
,
and
helping
it
off
with
its
boa
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jacky
,
in
husky
tones
,
replied
,
``
What
ho
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Been
out
?
''
he
asked
.
The
question
sounds
superfluous
,
*NL*
but
it
can
not
have
been
really
,
for
the
lady
answered
,
``
No
,
''
*NL*
adding
,
``
Oh
,
I
am
so
tired
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
tired
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
tired
,
''
said
he
,
hanging
the
boa
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Len
,
I
am
so
tired
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
been
to
that
classical
concert
I
told
you
about
,
''
*NL*
said
Leonard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
came
back
as
soon
as
it
was
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Any
one
been
round
to
our
place
?
''
asked
Jacky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
that
I
've
seen
.
I
met
Mr.
Cunningham
outside
,
and
*NL*
we
passed
a
few
remarks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
not
Mr.
Cunnginham
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
mean
Mr.
Cunningham
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
Mr.
Cunningham
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
been
out
to
tea
at
a
lady
friend
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
secret
being
at
last
given
to
the
world
,
and
the
*NL*
name
of
the
lady-friend
being
even
adumbrated
,
Jacky
made
no
*NL*
further
experiments
in
the
difficult
and
tiring
art
of
*NL*
conversation
.
She
never
had
been
a
great
talker
.
Even
in
*NL*
her
photographic
days
she
had
relied
upon
her
smile
and
her
*NL*
figure
to
attract
,
and
now
that
she
was
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
shelf
,
*NL*
On
the
shelf
,
*NL*
Boys
,
boys
,
I
'm
on
the
shelf
,
''
*NL*
*NL*
she
was
not
likely
to
find
her
tongue
.
Occasional
*NL*
bursts
of
song
-LRB-
of
which
the
above
is
an
example
-RRB-
still
*NL*
issued
from
her
lips
,
but
the
spoken
word
was
rare
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
down
on
Leonard
's
knee
,
and
began
to
fondle
*NL*
him
.
She
was
now
a
massive
woman
of
thirty-three
,
and
her
*NL*
weight
hurt
him
,
but
he
could
not
very
well
say
anything
.
*NL*
Then
she
said
,
``
Is
that
a
book
you
're
reading
?
''
and
he
said
,
*NL*
``
That
's
a
book
,
''
and
drew
it
from
her
unreluctant
grasp
.
*NL*
Margaret
's
card
fell
out
of
it
.
It
fell
face
downwards
,
and
*NL*
he
murmured
,
``
Bookmarker
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Len
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
he
asked
,
a
little
wearily
,
for
she
only
*NL*
had
one
topic
of
conversation
when
she
sat
upon
his
knee
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
love
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jacky
,
you
know
that
I
do

How
can
you
ask
such
questions
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
do
love
me
,
Len
,
do
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
do

''
*NL*
*NL*
A
pause
.
The
other
remark
was
still
due
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Len

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
What
is
it

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
the
boy
,
*NL*
flaring
up
into
a
sudden
passion
.
``
I
've
promised
to
marry
*NL*
you

My

my

I
've
promised
to
marry
you
as
soon
as
ever
I
'm
twenty-one
,
*NL*
and
I
ca
n't
keep
on
being
worried

I
've
worries
enough
.
It
*NL*
is
n't
likely
I
'd
throw
you
over
,
let
alone
my
word
,
when
*NL*
I
've
spent
all
this
money
.
Besides
,
I
'm
an
Englishman
,
and
*NL*
I
never
go
back
on
my
word
.
Jacky
,
do
be
reasonable

Of
*NL*
course
I
'll
marry
you

Only
do
stop
badgering
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
When
's
your
birthday
,
Len
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
told
you
again
and
again
,
the
eleventh
of
November
*NL*
next
.
Now
get
off
my
knee
a
bit
;
someone
must
get
supper
,
I
*NL*
suppose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jacky
went
through
to
the
bedroom
,
and
began
to
see
to
*NL*
her
hat
.
This
meant
blowing
at
it
with
short
sharp
puffs
.
*NL*
Leonard
tidied
up
the
sitting-room
,
and
began
to
prepare
*NL*
their
evening
meal
.
He
put
a
penny
into
the
slot
of
the
*NL*
gas-meter
,
and
soon
the
flat
was
reeking
with
metallic
*NL*
fumes
.
Somehow
he
could
not
recover
his
temper
,
and
all
the
*NL*
time
he
was
cooking
he
continued
to
complain
bitterly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
really
is
too
bad
when
a
fellow
is
n't
trusted
.
It
*NL*
makes
one
feel
so
wild
,
when
I
've
pretended
to
the
people
*NL*
here
that
you
're
my
wife
--
all
right
,
you
shall
be
my
*NL*
wife
--
and
I
've
bought
you
the
ring
to
wear
,
and
I
've
taken
*NL*
this
flat
furnished
,
and
it
's
far
more
than
I
can
afford
,
*NL*
and
yet
you
are
n't
content
,
and
I
've
also
not
told
the
truth
*NL*
when
I
've
written
home
.
''
He
lowered
his
voice
.
``
He
'd
stop
*NL*
it
.
''
In
a
tone
of
horror
,
that
was
a
little
luxurious
,
he
*NL*
repeated
:
``
My
brother
'd
stop
it
.
I
'm
going
against
the
*NL*
whole
world
,
Jacky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
what
I
am
,
Jacky
.
I
do
n't
take
any
heed
of
what
*NL*
anyone
says
.
I
just
go
straight
forward
,
I
do
.
That
's
*NL*
always
been
my
way
.
I
'm
not
one
of
your
weak
knock-kneed
*NL*
chaps
.
If
a
woman
's
in
trouble
,
I
do
n't
leave
her
in
the
*NL*
lurch
.
That
's
not
my
street
.
No
,
thank
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
another
thing
too
.
I
care
a
good
deal
*NL*
about
improving
myself
by
means
of
Literature
and
Art
,
and
*NL*
so
getting
a
wider
outlook
.
For
instance
,
when
you
came
in
*NL*
I
was
reading
Ruskin
's
STONES
OF
VENICE
.
I
do
n't
say
this
to
*NL*
boast
,
but
just
to
show
you
the
kind
of
man
I
am
.
I
can
*NL*
tell
you
,
I
enjoyed
that
classical
concert
this
afternoon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
all
his
moods
Jacky
remained
equally
indifferent
.
*NL*
When
supper
was
ready
--
and
not
before
--
she
emerged
from
the
*NL*
bedroom
,
saying
:
``
But
you
do
love
me
,
do
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
began
with
a
soup
square
,
which
Leonard
had
just
*NL*
dissolved
in
some
hot
water
.
It
was
followed
by
the
*NL*
tongue
--
a
freckled
cylinder
of
meat
,
with
a
little
jelly
at
*NL*
the
top
,
and
a
great
deal
of
yellow
fat
at
the
*NL*
bottom
--
ending
with
another
square
dissolved
in
water
*NL*
-LRB-
jelly
:
pineapple
-RRB-
,
which
Leonard
had
prepared
earlier
in
*NL*
the
day
.
Jacky
ate
contentedly
enough
,
occasionally
looking
*NL*
at
her
man
with
those
anxious
eyes
,
to
which
nothing
else
in
*NL*
her
appearance
corresponded
,
and
which
yet
seemed
to
mirror
*NL*
her
soul
.
And
Leonard
managed
to
convince
his
stomach
that
*NL*
it
was
having
a
nourishing
meal
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
supper
they
smoked
cigarettes
and
exchanged
a
few
*NL*
statements
.
She
observed
that
her
``
likeness
''
had
been
*NL*
broken
.
He
found
occasion
to
remark
,
for
the
second
time
,
*NL*
that
he
had
come
straight
back
home
after
the
concert
at
*NL*
Queen
's
Hall
.
Presently
she
sat
upon
his
knee
.
The
*NL*
inhabitants
of
Camelia
Road
tramped
to
and
fro
outside
the
*NL*
window
,
just
on
a
level
with
their
heads
,
and
the
family
in
*NL*
the
flat
on
the
ground-floor
began
to
sing
,
``
Hark
,
my
soul
,
*NL*
it
is
the
Lord
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
tune
fairly
gives
me
the
hump
,
''
said
Leonard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jacky
followed
this
,
and
said
that
,
for
her
part
,
she
*NL*
thought
it
a
lovely
tune
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
'll
play
you
something
lovely
.
Get
up
,
dear
,
for
*NL*
a
minute
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
to
the
piano
and
jingled
out
a
little
Grieg
.
He
*NL*
played
badly
and
vulgarly
,
but
the
performance
was
not
*NL*
without
its
effect
,
for
Jacky
said
she
thought
she
'd
be
*NL*
going
to
bed
.
As
she
receded
,
a
new
set
of
interests
*NL*
possessed
the
boy
,
and
he
began
to
think
of
what
had
been
*NL*
said
about
music
by
that
odd
Miss
Schlegel
--
the
one
that
*NL*
twisted
her
face
about
so
when
she
spoke
.
Then
the
thoughts
*NL*
grew
sad
and
envious
.
There
was
the
girl
named
Helen
,
who
*NL*
had
pinched
his
umbrella
,
and
the
German
girl
who
had
smiled
*NL*
at
him
pleasantly
,
and
Herr
someone
,
and
Aunt
someone
,
and
*NL*
the
brother
--
all
,
all
with
their
hands
on
the
ropes
.
They
*NL*
had
all
passed
up
that
narrow
,
rich
staircase
at
Wickham
*NL*
Place
,
to
some
ample
room
,
whither
he
could
never
follow
*NL*
them
,
not
if
he
read
for
ten
hours
a
day
.
Oh
,
it
was
not
*NL*
good
,
this
continual
aspiration
.
Some
are
born
cultured
;
*NL*
the
rest
had
better
go
in
for
whatever
comes
easy
.
To
see
*NL*
life
steadily
and
to
see
it
whole
was
not
for
the
likes
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
darkness
beyond
the
kitchen
a
voice
called
,
``
Len
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
in
bed
?
''
he
asked
,
his
forehead
twitching
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
M
'm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
she
called
him
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
clean
my
boots
ready
for
the
morning
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
she
called
him
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
rather
want
to
get
this
chapter
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
closed
his
ears
against
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
Jacky
,
nothing
;
I
'm
reading
a
book
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
he
answered
,
catching
her
degraded
deafness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
she
called
him
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ruskin
had
visited
Torcello
by
this
time
,
and
was
*NL*
ordering
his
gondoliers
to
take
him
to
Murano
.
It
occurred
*NL*
to
him
,
as
he
glided
over
the
whispering
lagoons
,
that
the
*NL*
power
of
Nature
could
not
be
shortened
by
the
folly
,
nor
her
*NL*
beauty
altogether
saddened
by
the
misery
,
of
such
as
*NL*
Leonard
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
7
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Margaret
,
''
cried
her
aunt
next
morning
,
``
such
a
most
*NL*
unfortunate
thing
has
happened
.
I
could
not
get
you
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
most
unfortunate
thing
was
not
very
serious
.
One
of
*NL*
the
flats
in
the
ornate
block
opposite
had
been
taken
*NL*
furnished
by
the
Wilcox
family
,
``
coming
up
,
no
doubt
,
in
the
*NL*
hope
of
getting
into
London
society
.
''
That
Mrs.
Munt
should
*NL*
be
the
first
to
discover
the
misfortune
was
not
remarkable
,
*NL*
for
she
was
so
interested
in
the
flats
,
that
she
watched
*NL*
their
every
mutation
with
unwearying
care
.
In
theory
she
*NL*
despised
them
--
they
took
away
that
old-world
look
--
they
cut
*NL*
off
the
sun
--
flats
house
a
flashy
type
of
person
.
But
if
*NL*
the
truth
had
been
known
,
she
found
her
visits
to
Wickham
*NL*
Place
twice
as
amusing
since
Wickham
Mansions
had
arisen
,
*NL*
and
would
in
a
couple
of
days
learn
more
about
them
than
her
*NL*
nieces
in
a
couple
of
months
,
or
her
nephew
in
a
couple
of
*NL*
years
.
She
would
stroll
across
and
make
friends
with
the
*NL*
porters
,
and
inquire
what
the
rents
were
,
exclaiming
for
*NL*
example
:
``
What
!
a
hundred
and
twenty
for
a
basement
?
*NL*
You
'll
never
get
it
!
''
And
they
would
answer
:
``
One
can
but
*NL*
try
,
madam
.
''
The
passenger
lifts
,
the
provision
lifts
,
the
*NL*
arrangement
for
coals
-LRB-
a
great
temptation
for
a
dishonest
*NL*
porter
-RRB-
,
were
all
familiar
matters
to
her
,
and
perhaps
a
*NL*
relief
from
the
politico-economical-aesthetic
atmosphere
that
*NL*
reigned
at
the
Schlegels
'
.
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
received
the
information
calmly
,
and
did
not
*NL*
agree
that
it
would
throw
a
cloud
over
poor
Helen
's
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
Helen
is
n't
a
girl
with
no
interests
,
''
she
*NL*
explained
.
``
She
has
plenty
of
other
things
and
other
people
*NL*
to
think
about
.
She
made
a
false
start
with
the
Wilcoxes
,
*NL*
and
she
'll
be
as
willing
as
we
are
to
have
nothing
more
to
*NL*
do
with
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
a
clever
girl
,
dear
,
how
very
oddly
you
do
talk
.
*NL*
Helen
'll
HAVE
to
have
something
more
to
do
with
them
,
now
*NL*
that
they
're
all
opposite
.
She
may
meet
that
Paul
in
the
*NL*
street
.
She
can
not
very
well
not
bow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
she
must
bow
.
But
look
here
;
let
's
do
the
*NL*
flowers
.
I
was
going
to
say
,
the
will
to
be
interested
in
*NL*
him
has
died
,
and
what
else
matters
?
I
look
on
that
*NL*
disastrous
episode
-LRB-
over
which
you
were
so
kind
-RRB-
as
the
*NL*
killing
of
a
nerve
in
Helen
.
It
's
dead
,
and
she
'll
never
be
*NL*
troubled
with
it
again
.
The
only
things
that
matter
are
the
*NL*
things
that
interest
one
.
Bowing
,
even
calling
and
leaving
*NL*
cards
,
even
a
dinner-party
--
we
can
do
all
those
things
to
*NL*
the
Wilcoxes
,
if
they
find
it
agreeable
;
but
the
other
*NL*
thing
,
the
one
important
thing
--
never
again

Do
n't
you
see
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Munt
did
not
see
,
and
indeed
Margaret
was
making
a
*NL*
most
questionable
statement
--
that
any
emotion
,
any
interest
*NL*
once
vividly
aroused
,
can
wholly
die
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
also
have
the
honour
to
inform
you
that
the
Wilcoxes
*NL*
are
bored
with
us

I
did
n't
tell
you
at
the
time

it
might
*NL*
have
made
you
angry
,
and
you
had
enough
to
worry
you
--
but
I
*NL*
wrote
a
letter
to
Mrs.
W.
,
and
apologized
for
the
trouble
*NL*
that
Helen
had
given
them
.
She
did
n't
answer
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
very
rude

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder

Or
was
it
sensible

``
No

``
In

*NL*
Mrs.
Munt
sighed
.
She
was
going
back
to
Swanage
on
the
*NL*
morrow
,
just
as
her
nieces
were
wanting
her
most
.
Other
*NL*
regrets
crowded
upon
her
:
for
instance
,
how
magnificently
*NL*
she
would
have
cut
Charles
if
she
had
met
him
face
to
face
.
*NL*
She
had
already
seen
him
,
giving
an
order
to
the
porter
--
and
*NL*
very
common
he
looked
in
a
tall
hat
.
But
unfortunately
his
*NL*
back
was
turned
to
her
,
and
though
she
had
cut
his
back
,
she
*NL*
could
not
regard
this
as
a
telling
snub
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
will
be
careful
,
wo
n't
you
?
''
she
exhorted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
certainly
.
Fiendishly
careful

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Helen
must
be
careful
,
too
,
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Careful
over
what
?
''
cried
Helen
,
at
that
moment
coming
*NL*
into
the
room
with
her
cousin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
''
said
Margaret
,
seized
with
a
momentary
awkwardness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Careful
over
what
,
Aunt
Juley
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Munt
assumed
a
cryptic
air
.
``
It
is
only
that
a
*NL*
certain
family
,
whom
we
know
by
name
but
do
not
mention

you
said
yourself
last
night
after

the
flat
opposite
from
the
Mathesons

where
the
plants
are

in

balcony

''
*NL*
*NL*
Helen
began
some
laughing
reply
,
and
then
disconcerted
*NL*
them
all
by
blushing
.
Mrs.
Munt
was
so
disconcerted
that
*NL*
she
exclaimed
,
``
What

Helen

you
do
n't
mind
them
coming

and
deepened
the
blush
to
crimson

*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
do
n't
mind

said
Helen
a
little
crossly
.

``

*NL*
``

protested
Margaret

a
little
cross
in

her
turn

Mrs.

*NL*
``
Hark

interrupted
Fraulein
Mosebach
.
``
I
hear
Bruno
*NL*
entering
the
hall

''
*NL*
*NL*
For
Herr
Liesecke
was
due
at
Wickham
Place
to
call
for
*NL*
the
two
younger
girls
.
He
was
not
entering
the
hall
--
in
*NL*
fact
,
he
did
not
enter
it
for
quite
five
minutes
.
But
*NL*
Frieda
detected
a
delicate
situation
,
and
said
that
she
and
*NL*
Helen
had
much
better
wait
for
Bruno
down
below
,
and
leave
*NL*
Margaret
and
Mrs.
Munt
to
finish
arranging
the
flowers
.
*NL*
Helen
acquiesced
.
But
,
as
if
to
prove
that
the
situation
*NL*
was
not
delicate
really
,
she
stopped
in
the
doorway
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
say
the
Mathesons

flat

Aunt
Juley

How
*NL*
wonderful
you
are

I
never
knew
that
the
woman

laced

tightly

Matheson

*NL*
*NL*
``
Come

Helen

said
her
cousin

*NL*
*NL*
``
Go

Helen

said
her
aunt
;

continued
to
Margaret
*NL*
almost
in
the

breath
:
``

can
not
deceive
me

She
*NL*
does

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

''
breathed
Margaret
.
``
Frieda
'll
hear
you

*NL*
she
can
be
so
tiresome

*NL*
*NL*
``
She
minds

''
persisted
Mrs.
Munt
,
moving
thoughtfully
*NL*
about
the
room
,
and
pulling
the
dead
chrysanthemums
out
of
*NL*
the
vases
.
``
I
knew
she
'd
mind

and
I
'm
sure
a

to

Such
an

Such
awful
coarse-grained
people
!
*NL*
I
know
more
about
them
than
you
do
,
which
you
forget
,
and
if
*NL*
Charles
had
taken
you
that

you

reached

Oh

Margaret

know
what
you
are
in
for

They
're
all
bottled
up
against

the
drawing-room
window

There

Mrs.
Wilcox

I
've
seen

her

There

Paul

There

Evie

who
is
a
minx

There

*NL*
Charles

I
saw
him
to

who

an
elderly

man
with
a
moustache

a
copper-coloured
face
be

*NL*
``
Mr.

there

Mr.

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
shame
to
call
his

copper
colour

*NL*
complained
Margaret
.
``
He
has
a
remarkably
good
complexion

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Munt
,
triumphant
elsewhere
,
could
afford
to
concede
*NL*
Mr.
Wilcox
his
complexion
.
She
passed
on
from
it
to
the
*NL*
plan
of
campaign
that
her
nieces
should
pursue
in
the
*NL*
future
.
Margaret
tried
to
stop
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Helen
did
not
take
the
news
quite
as
I
expected

*NL*
the
Wilcox
nerve
is
dead
in

there
's
no

's
as
well
not
to

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
Her
thought
drew
being
from
the
obscure
borderland
.
She
*NL*
could
not
explain
in
so
many
words
,
but
she
felt
that
those
*NL*
who
prepare
for
all
the
emergencies
of
life
beforehand
may
*NL*
equip
themselves
at
the
expense
of
joy
.
It
is
necessary
to
*NL*
prepare
for
an
examination
,
or
a
dinner-party
,
or
a
possible
*NL*
fall
in
the
price
of
stock
:
those
who
attempt
human
*NL*
relations
must
adopt
another
method
,
or
fail
.
``
Because
I
'd
*NL*
sooner
risk
it
,
''
was
her
lame
conclusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
imagine
the
evenings
,
''
exclaimed
her
aunt
,
pointing
*NL*
to
the
Mansions
with
the
spout
of
the
watering-can
.
``
Turn
*NL*
the
electric
light
on
her

there

and
it
's
almost
the

*NL*
room

One
evening
they
may
forget
to
draw
their
blinds

down
,
and
you
'll
see
them

the
next

you

you

Impossible

sit
out
on

Impossible

water
the

Imagine

going
out

front-door

they
come
out
opposite
at

the

moment

you
tell
me
that

unnecessary

*NL*

*NL*

never

*NL*
``

What
a
shocking

*NL*
*NL*
``

pads
the
edges
of

said
Miss
Schlegel
.
*NL*
``
God
help
those
who
have
none

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
this
is
something
quite
new
!
''
said
Mrs.
Munt
,
who
*NL*
collected
new
ideas
as
a
squirrel
collects
nuts
,
and
was
*NL*
especially
attracted
by
those
that
are
portable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
New
for
me
;
sensible
people
have
acknowledged
it
for
*NL*
years
.
You
and
I
and
the
Wilcoxes
stand
upon
money
as
upon
*NL*
islands
.
It
is
so
firm
beneath
our
feet
that
we
forget
its
*NL*
very
existence
.
It
's
only
when
we
see
someone
near
us
*NL*
tottering
that
we
realize
all
that
an
independent
income
*NL*
means
.
Last
night
,
when
we
were
talking
up
here
round
the
*NL*
fire
,
I
began
to
think
that
the
very
soul
of
the
world
is
*NL*
economic
,
and
that
the
lowest
abyss
is
not
the
absence
of
*NL*
love
,
but
the
absence
of
coin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
call
that
rather
cynical
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
do
I
.
But
Helen
and
I
,
we
ought
to
remember
,
when
we
*NL*
are
tempted
to
criticize
others
,
that
we
are
standing
on
*NL*
these
islands
,
and
that
most
of
the
others
,
are
down
below
*NL*
the
surface
of
the
sea
.
The
poor
can
not
always
reach
those
*NL*
whom
they
want
to
love
,
and
they
can
hardly
ever
escape
from
*NL*
those
whom
they
love
no
longer
.
We
rich
can
.
Imagine
the
*NL*
tragedy
last
June
,
if
Helen
and
Paul
Wilcox
had
been
poor
*NL*
people
,
and
could
n't
invoke
railways
and
motor-cars
to
part
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
more
like
Socialism
,
''
said
Mrs.
Munt
suspiciously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Call
it
what
you
like

I
call
it
going
through
life
*NL*
with
one
's
hand
spread
open
on
the
table
.
I
'm
tired
of
*NL*
these
rich
people
who
pretend
to
be
poor
,
and
think
it
shows
*NL*
a
nice
mind
to
ignore
the
piles
of
money
that
keep
their
*NL*
feet
above
the
waves

I
stand
each
year
upon
six
hundred
*NL*
pounds
,
and
Helen
upon
the

,

Tibby
will
stand
upon

eight

as
fast
as
our
pounds
crumble
away
into
the
sea
*NL*
they
are
renewed
--
from
the
sea

yes

from
the
sea

And
all
*NL*
our
thoughts
are
the
thoughts
of
six-hundred-pounders

*NL*
all
our
speeches

because
we
do
n't
want

we

that

people
do

want

do
steal
them
sometimes

Margaret
in
tones
that
were
suddenly
preoccupied

Mrs.

having
,
as
it

at

secured
her
nut
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

acquaintances

am
surprised

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

would
you
be
very
kind

Would
you
come
round
*NL*
with

to
the

There
's
a
housemaid
who
*NL*
wo
n't

yes

does
n't
say
no

''
*NL*
*NL*
On
their
way
thither
they
too
looked
up
at
the
Wilcoxes
'
*NL*
flat
.
Evie
was
in
the
balcony
,
``
staring
most
rudely
,
''
*NL*
according
to
Mrs.
Munt
.
Oh
yes
,
it
was
a
nuisance
,
there
*NL*
was
no
doubt
of
it
.
Helen
was
proof
against
a
passing
*NL*
encounter
but
--
Margaret
began
to
lose
confidence
.
Might
it
*NL*
reawake
the
dying
nerve
if
the
family
were
living
close
*NL*
against
her
eyes
?
And
Frieda
Mosebach
was
stopping
with
*NL*
them
for
another
fortnight
,
and
Frieda
was
sharp
,
abominably
*NL*
sharp
,
and
quite
capable
of
remarking
,
``
You
love
one
of
the
*NL*
young
gentlemen
opposite
,
yes
?
''
The
remark
would
be
untrue
,
*NL*
but
of
the
kind
which
,
if
stated
often
enough
,
may
become
*NL*
true
;
just
as
the
remark
,
``
England
and
Germany
are
bound
to
*NL*
fight
,
''
renders
war
a
little
more
likely
each
time
that
it
*NL*
is
made
,
and
is
therefore
made
the
more
readily
by
the
*NL*
gutter
press
of
either
nation
.
Have
the
private
emotions
*NL*
also
their
gutter
press
?
Margaret
thought
so
,
and
feared
*NL*
that
good
Aunt
Juley
and
Frieda
were
typical
specimens
of
*NL*
it
.
They
might
,
by
continual
chatter
,
lead
Helen
into
a
*NL*
repetition
of
the
desires
of
June
.
Into
a
repetition
--
they
*NL*
could
not
do
more
;
they
could
not
lead
her
into
lasting
*NL*
love
.
They
were
--
she
saw
it
clearly
--
Journalism
;
her
*NL*
father
,
with
all
his
defects
and
wrong-headedness
,
had
been
*NL*
Literature
,
and
had
he
lived
,
he
would
have
persuaded
his
*NL*
daughter
rightly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
registry
office
was
holding
its
morning
reception
.
*NL*
A
string
of
carriages
filled
the
street
.
Miss
Schlegel
*NL*
waited
her
turn
,
and
finally
had
to
be
content
with
an
*NL*
insidious
``
temporary
,
''
being
rejected
by
genuine
housemaids
*NL*
on
the
ground
of
her
numerous
stairs
.
Her
failure
depressed
*NL*
her
,
and
though
she
forgot
the
failure
,
the
depression
*NL*
remained
.
On
her
way
home
she
again
glanced
up
at
the
*NL*
Wilcoxes
'
flat
,
and
took
the
rather
matronly
step
of
*NL*
speaking
about
the
matter
to
Helen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Helen
,
you
must
tell
me
whether
this
thing
worries
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
what
?
''
said
Helen
,
who
was
washing
her
hands
for
lunch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
W.
's
coming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
of
course
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
.
''
Then
she
admitted
that
she
was
a
little
*NL*
worried
on
Mrs.
Wilcox
's
account
;
she
implied
that
Mrs.
*NL*
Wilcox
might
reach
backward
into
deep
feelings
,
and
be
*NL*
pained
by
things
that
never
touched
the
other
members
of
*NL*
that
clan
.
``
I
sha
n't
mind
if
Paul
points
at
our
house
and
*NL*
says
,
`
There
lives
the
girl
who
tried
to
catch
me
.
'
But
she
might
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
even
that
worries
you
,
we
could
arrange
something
.
*NL*
There
's
no
reason
we
should
be
near
people
who
displease
us
*NL*
or
whom
we
displease
,
thanks
to
our
money
.
We
might
even
go
*NL*
away
for
a
little
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
am
going
away
.
Frieda
's
just
asked
me
to
*NL*
Stettin
,
and
I
sha
n't
be
back
till
after
the
New
Year
.
Will
*NL*
that
do
?
Or
must
I
fly
the
country
altogether
?
Really
,
*NL*
Meg
,
what
has
come
over
you
to
make
such
a
fuss
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'm
getting
an
old
maid
,
I
suppose

I
thought
I
*NL*
minded
nothing

really
I
--
I
should
be
bored
if
you
fell
*NL*
in
love
with
the
same
man
twice
and
''
--
she
cleared
her
*NL*
throat
--
``
you
did
go
red

when
Aunt
Juley
attacked

have
referred
to
it
otherwise

*NL*
*NL*
But
Helen
's
laugh
rang
true
,
as
she
raised
a
soapy
hand
*NL*
to
heaven
and
swore
that
never
,
nowhere
and
nohow
,
would
she
*NL*
again
fall
in
love
with
any
of
the
Wilcox
family
,
down
to
*NL*
its
remotest
collaterals
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
The
friendship
between
Margaret
and
Mrs.
Wilcox
,
which
was
*NL*
to
develop
so
--
quickly
and
with
such
strange
results
,
may
*NL*
perhaps
have
had
its
beginnings
at
Speyer
,
in
the
spring
.
*NL*
Perhaps
the
elder
lady
,
as
she
gazed
at
the
vulgar
,
ruddy
*NL*
cathedral
,
and
listened
to
the
talk
of
Helen
and
her
*NL*
husband
,
may
have
detected
in
the
other
and
less
charming
of
*NL*
the
sisters
a
deeper
sympathy
,
a
sounder
judgment
.
She
was
*NL*
capable
of
detecting
such
things
.
Perhaps
it
was
she
who
*NL*
had
desired
the
Miss
Schlegels
to
be
invited
to
Howards
End
,
*NL*
and
Margaret
whose
presence
she
had
particularly
desired
.
*NL*
All
this
is
speculation
:
Mrs.
Wilcox
has
left
few
clear
*NL*
indications
behind
her
.
It
is
certain
that
she
came
to
call
*NL*
at
Wickham
Place
a
fortnight
later
,
the
very
day
that
Helen
*NL*
was
going
with
her
cousin
to
Stettin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Helen
!
''
cried
Fraulein
Mosebach
in
awestruck
tones
-LRB-
she
*NL*
was
now
in
her
cousin
's
confidence
-RRB-
--
``
his
mother
has
*NL*
forgiven
you
!
''
And
then
,
remembering
that
in
England
the
*NL*
new-comer
ought
not
to
call
before
she
is
called
upon
,
she
*NL*
changed
her
tone
from
awe
to
disapproval
,
and
opined
that
*NL*
Mrs.
Wilcox
was
``
keine
Dame
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bother
the
whole
family
!
''
snapped
Margaret
.
``
Helen
,
*NL*
stop
giggling
and
pirouetting
,
and
go
and
finish
your
*NL*
packing
.
Why
ca
n't
the
woman
leave
us
alone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
I
shall
do
with
Meg
,
''
Helen
retorted
,
*NL*
collapsing
upon
the
stairs
.
``
She
's
got
Wilcox
and
Box
upon
*NL*
the
brain
.
Meg
,
Meg
,
I
do
n't
love

I
*NL*

Meg
,
Meg
.
Can
a
body
speak
plainer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Most
certainly
her
love
has
died
,
''
asserted
Fraulein
Mosebach
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Most
certainly
it
has
,
Frieda
,
but
that
will
not
*NL*
prevent
me
from
being
bored
with
the
Wilcoxes
if
I
return
*NL*
the
call
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Helen
simulated
tears
,
and
Fraulein
Mosebach
,
who
*NL*
thought
her
extremely
amusing
,
did
the
same
.
``
Oh
,
boo
hoo
!
*NL*
boo
hoo
hoo
!
Meg
's
going
to
return
the
call
,
and
I
ca
n't

*NL*
`
Cos

`
Cos
I
'm
going
to
German-eye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
are
going
to
Germany
,
go
and
pack
;
if
you
*NL*
are
n't

and
call
on
the
Wilcoxes
instead
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Meg
,
Meg
,

do
n't

young

*NL*

,
who

that
coming
down
the
*NL*
stairs

I

''
*NL*
*NL*
A
male
--
even
such
a
male
as
Tibby
--
was
enough
to
stop
*NL*
the
foolery
.
The
barrier
of
sex
,
though
decreasing
among
*NL*
the
civilized
,
is
still
high
,
and
higher
on
the
side
of
*NL*
women
.
Helen
could
tell
her
sister
all
,
and
her
cousin
much
*NL*
about
Paul
;
she
told
her
brother
nothing
.
It
was
not
*NL*
prudishness
,
for
she
now
spoke
of
``
the
Wilcox
ideal
''
with
*NL*
laughter
,
and
even
with
a
growing
brutality
.
Nor
was
it
*NL*
precaution
,
for
Tibby
seldom
repeated
any
news
that
did
not
*NL*
concern
himself
.
It
was
rather
the
feeling
that
she
*NL*
betrayed
a
secret
into
the
camp
of
men
,
and
that
,
however
*NL*
trivial
it
was
on
this
side
of
the
barrier
,
it
would
become
*NL*
important
on
that
.
So
she
stopped
,
or
rather
began
to
fool
*NL*
on
other
subjects
,
until
her
long-suffering
relatives
drove
*NL*
her
upstairs
.
Fraulein
Mosebach
followed
her
,
but
lingered
*NL*
to
say
heavily
over
the
banisters
to
Margaret
,
``
It
is
all
*NL*
right
--
she
does
not
love
the
young
man
--
he
has
not
been
*NL*
worthy
of
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
know
;
thanks
very
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
I
did
right
to
tell
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ever
so
many
thanks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
that
?
''
asked
Tibby
.
No
one
told
him
,
and
he
*NL*
proceeded
into
the
dining-room
,
to
eat
Elvas
plums
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
evening
Margaret
took
decisive
action
.
The
house
*NL*
was
very
quiet
,
and
the
fog
--
we
are
in
November
now
--
pressed
*NL*
against
the
windows
like
an
excluded
ghost
.
Frieda
and
*NL*
Helen
and
all
their
luggage
had
gone
.
Tibby
,
who
was
not
*NL*
feeling
well
,
lay
stretched
on
a
sofa
by
the
fire
.
Margaret
*NL*
sat
by
him
,
thinking
.
Her
mind
darted
from
impulse
to
*NL*
impulse
,
and
finally
marshalled
them
all
in
review
.
The
*NL*
practical
person
,
who
knows
what
he
wants
at
once
,
and
*NL*
generally
knows
nothing
else
,
will
excuse
her
of
*NL*
indecision
.
But
this
was
the
way
her
mind
worked
.
And
when
*NL*
she
did
act
,
no
one
could
accuse
her
of
indecision
then
.
*NL*
She
hit
out
as
lustily
as
if
she
had
not
considered
the
*NL*
matter
at
all
.
The
letter
that
she
wrote
Mrs.
Wilcox
glowed
*NL*
with
the
native
hue
of
resolution
.
The
pale
cast
of
thought
*NL*
was
with
her
a
breath
rather
than
a
tarnish
,
a
breath
that
*NL*
leaves
the
colours
all
the
more
vivid
when
it
has
been
wiped
*NL*
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Dear
Mrs.
Wilcox
,
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
to
write
something
discourteous
.
It
would
be
*NL*
better
if
we
did
not
meet
.
Both
my
sister
and
my
aunt
*NL*
have
given
displeasure
to
your
family
,
and
,
in
my
*NL*
sister
's
case
,
the
grounds
for
displeasure
might
recur
.
*NL*
As
far
as
I
know
,
she
no
longer
occupies
her
thoughts
*NL*
with
your
son
.
But
it
would
not
be
fair
,
either
to
her
*NL*
or
to
you
,
if
they
met
,
and
it
is
therefore
right
that
*NL*
our
acquaintance
which
began
so
pleasantly
,
should
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
fear
that
you
will
not
agree
with
this
;
indeed
,
I
*NL*
know
that
you
will
not
,
since
you
have
been
good
enough
*NL*
to
call
on
us
.
It
is
only
an
instinct
on
my
part
,
and
no
*NL*
doubt
the
instinct
is
wrong
.
My
sister
would
,
*NL*
undoubtedly
,
say
that
it
is
wrong
.
I
write
without
her
*NL*
knowledge
,
and
I
hope
that
you
will
not
associate
her
*NL*
with
my
discourtesy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Believe
me
,
*NL*
Yours
truly
,
*NL*
M.
J.
Schlegel
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
sent
this
letter
round
by
post
.
Next
morning
*NL*
she
received
the
following
reply
by
hand
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Dear
Miss
Schlegel
,
*NL*
*NL*
You
should
not
have
written
me
such
a
letter
.
I
*NL*
called
to
tell
you
that
Paul
has
gone
abroad
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ruth
Wilcox
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
's
cheeks
burnt
.
She
could
not
finish
her
*NL*
breakfast
.
She
was
on
fire
with
shame
.
Helen
had
told
her
*NL*
that
the
youth
was
leaving
England
,
but
other
things
had
*NL*
seemed
more
important
,
and
she
had
forgotten
.
All
her
*NL*
absurd
anxieties
fell
to
the
ground
,
and
in
their
place
*NL*
arose
the
certainty
that
she
had
been
rude
to
Mrs.
Wilcox
.
*NL*
Rudeness
affected
Margaret
like
a
bitter
taste
in
the
*NL*
mouth
.
It
poisoned
life
.
At
times
it
is
necessary
,
but
woe
*NL*
to
those
who
employ
it
without
due
need
.
She
flung
on
a
hat
*NL*
and
shawl
,
just
like
a
poor
woman
,
and
plunged
into
the
fog
,
*NL*
which
still
continued
.
Her
lips
were
compressed
,
the
letter
*NL*
remained
in
her
hand
,
and
in
this
state
she
crossed
the
*NL*
street
,
entered
the
marble
vestibule
of
the
flats
,
eluded
*NL*
the
concierges
,
and
ran
up
the
stairs
till
she
reached
the
*NL*
second-floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
sent
in
her
name
,
and
to
her
surprise
was
shown
*NL*
straight
into
Mrs.
Wilcox
's
bedroom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Mrs.
Wilcox
,
I
have
made
the
baddest
blunder
.
I
am
*NL*
more
,
more
ashamed
and
sorry
than
I
can
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Wilcox
bowed
gravely
.
She
was
offended
,
and
did
*NL*
not
pretend
to
the
contrary
.
She
was
sitting
up
in
bed
,
*NL*
writing
letters
on
an
invalid
table
that
spanned
her
knees
.
*NL*
A
breakfast
tray
was
on
another
table
beside
her
.
The
light
*NL*
of
the
fire
,
the
light
from
the
window
,
and
the
light
of
a
*NL*
candle-lamp
,
which
threw
a
quivering
halo
round
her
hands
,
*NL*
combined
to
create
a
strange
atmosphere
of
dissolution
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
he
was
going
to
India
in
November
,
but
I
forgot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
sailed
on
the
17th
for
Nigeria
,
in
Africa

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew

I
know

I
have
been
too
absurd
all
through

I
*NL*
am
very
much
ashamed

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Wilcox
did
not
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
more
sorry
than
I
can
say

and
I
hope
that
you
*NL*
will
forgive
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
does
n't
matter

Miss
Schlegel

round

promptly

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
does

cried
Margaret
.
``
I
have
been
rude

*NL*
``

exclaimed
Margaret
,
getting
*NL*
more
and
more
excited
,
and
taking
a
chair
without
*NL*
invitation
.
``
How
perfectly
extraordinary

I
can
see

``
I
did

it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
most
difficult
question

''
said
Mrs.
Wilcox
,
*NL*
smiling
,
and
a
little
losing
her
expression
of
annoyance
.
*NL*
``
I
think
you
put
it
best
in

It

Then

She
repeated

*NL*
*NL*
``
In

they
belong

dreadfully

Mrs.

it

I
am
a
little
tired
.
First
came
the
*NL*
wedding
,
and
then
Paul
went
off
,
and
,
instead
of
resting
*NL*
yesterday
,
I
paid
a
round
of
calls
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
wedding
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
Charles
,
my
elder
son
,
is
married
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
took
the
flat
chiefly
on
that
account
,
and
also
that
*NL*
Paul
could
get
his
African
outfit
.
The
flat
belongs
to
a
*NL*
cousin
of
my
husband
's
,
and
she
most
kindly
offered
it
to
*NL*
us
.
So
before
the
day
came
we
were
able
to
make
the
*NL*
acquaintance
of
Dolly
's
people
,
which
we
had
not
yet
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
asked
who
Dolly
's
people
were
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fussell
.
The
father
is
in
the
Indian
army
--
retired
;
*NL*
the
brother
is
in
the
army
.
The
mother
is
dead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
perhaps
these
were
the
``
chinless
sunburnt
men
''
whom
*NL*
Helen
had
espied
one
afternoon
through
the
window
.
Margaret
*NL*
felt
mildly
interested
in
the
fortunes
of
the
Wilcox
*NL*
family
.
She
had
acquired
the
habit
on
Helen
's
account
,
and
*NL*
it
still
clung
to
her
.
She
asked
for
more
information
about
*NL*
Miss
Dolly
Fussell
that
was
,
and
was
given
it
in
even
,
*NL*
unemotional
tones
.
Mrs.
Wilcox
's
voice
,
though
sweet
and
*NL*
compelling
,
had
little
range
of
expression
.
It
suggested
*NL*
that
pictures
,
concerts
,
and
people
are
all
of
small
and
*NL*
equal
value
.
Only
once
had
it
quickened
--
when
speaking
of
*NL*
Howards
End
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Charles
and
Albert
Fussell
have
known
one
another
some
*NL*
time
.
They
belong
to
the
same
club
,
and
are
both
devoted
to
*NL*
golf
.
Dolly
plays
golf
too
,
though
I
believe
not
so
well
,
*NL*
and
they
first
met
in
a
mixed
foursome
.
We
all
like
her
,
*NL*
and
are
very
much
pleased
.
They
were
married
on
the
11th
,
a
*NL*
few
days
before
Paul
sailed
.
Charles
was
very
anxious
to
*NL*
have
his
brother
as
best
man
,
so
he
made
a
great
point
of
*NL*
having
it
on
the
11th
.
The
Fussells
would
have
preferred
it
*NL*
after
Christmas
,
but
they
were
very
nice
about
it
.
There
is
*NL*
Dolly
's
photograph
--
in
that
double
frame
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
quite
certain
that
I
'm
not
interrupting
,
Mrs.
Wilcox
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
quite
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
will
stay
.
I
'm
enjoying
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dolly
's
photograph
was
now
examined
.
It
was
signed
``
For
*NL*
dear
Mims
,
''
which
Mrs.
Wilcox
interpreted
as
``
the
name
she
*NL*
and
Charles
had
settled
that
she
should
call
me
.
''
Dolly
*NL*
looked
silly
,
and
had
one
of
those
triangular
faces
that
so
*NL*
often
prove
attractive
to
a
robust
man
.
She
was
very
*NL*
pretty
.
From
her
Margaret
passed
to
Charles
,
whose
features
*NL*
prevailed
opposite
.
She
speculated
on
the
forces
that
had
*NL*
drawn
the
two
together
till
God
parted
them
.
She
found
time
*NL*
to
hope
that
they
would
be
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
have
gone
to
Naples
for
their
honeymoon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lucky
people
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
hardly
imagine
Charles
in
Italy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
n't
he
care
for
travelling
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
likes
travel
,
but
he
does
see
through
foreigners
*NL*
so
.
What
he
enjoys
most
is
a
motor
tour
in
England
,
and
I
*NL*
think
that
would
have
carried
the
day
if
the
weather
had
not
*NL*
been
so
abominable
.
His
father
gave
him
a
car
of
his
own
*NL*
for
a
wedding
present
,
which
for
the
present
is
being
stored
*NL*
at
Howards
End
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
have
a
garage
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
My
husband
built
a
little
one
only
last
month
,
to
*NL*
the
west
of
the
house
,
not
far
from
the
wych-elm
,
in
what
*NL*
used
to
be
the
paddock
for
the
pony
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
last
words
had
an
indescribable
ring
about
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
's
the
pony
gone
?
''
asked
Margaret
after
a
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
pony
?
Oh
,
dead
,
ever
so
long
ago
.
''
``
The
wych-elm
I
*NL*
remember
.
Helen
spoke
of
it
as
a
very
splendid
tree
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
the
finest
wych-elm
in
Hertfordshire

Did
your
*NL*
sister
tell
you
about
the
teeth

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
might
interest
you

There
are
pigs

teeth
stuck
*NL*
into
the
trunk
,
about
four
feet
from
the
ground
.
The
*NL*
country
people
put
them
in
long
ago
,
and
they
think
that
if
*NL*
they
chew
a
piece
of
the
bark
,
it
will
cure
the
toothache
.
*NL*
The
teeth
are
almost
grown
over
now
,
and
no
one
comes
to
the
*NL*
tree
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
.
I
love
folklore
and
all
festering
superstitions

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
that
the
tree
really
did
cure
toothache

*NL*
if
one
believed
in
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
it
did

It
would
cure
anything

once

*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
I
remember
cases
--
you
see
I
lived
at
Howards
*NL*
End
long
,
long
before
Mr.
Wilcox
knew
it
.
I
was
born
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
conversation
again
shifted
.
At
the
time
it
seemed
*NL*
little
more
than
aimless
chatter
.
She
was
interested
when
*NL*
her
hostess
explained
that
Howards
End
was
her
own
*NL*
property
.
She
was
bored
when
too
minute
an
account
was
*NL*
given
of
the
Fussell
family
,
of
the
anxieties
of
Charles
*NL*
concerning
Naples
,
of
the
movements
of
Mr.
Wilcox
and
Evie
,
*NL*
who
were
motoring
in
Yorkshire
.
Margaret
could
not
bear
*NL*
being
bored
.
She
grew
inattentive
,
played
with
the
*NL*
photograph
frame
,
dropped
it
,
smashed
Dolly
's
glass
,
*NL*
apologized
,
was
pardoned
,
cut
her
finger
thereon
,
was
*NL*
pitied
,
and
finally
said
she
must
be
going
--
there
was
all
*NL*
the
housekeeping
to
do
,
and
she
had
to
interview
Tibby
's
*NL*
riding-master
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
curious
note
was
struck
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
,
Miss
Schlegel
,
good-bye
.
Thank
you
for
*NL*
coming

You
have
cheered
me
up

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
so
glad

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
--
I
wonder
whether
you
ever
think
about
yourself

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
of
nothing
else

''
said
Margaret
,
blushing
,
but
*NL*
letting
her
hand
remain
in
that
of
the
invalid
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
.
I
wondered
at
Heidelberg

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'M
sure

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
almost
think
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
?
''
asked
Margaret
,
for
there
was
a
long
pause
--
a
*NL*
pause
that
was
somehow
akin
to
the
flicker
of
the
fire
,
the
*NL*
quiver
of
the
reading-lamp
upon
their
hands
,
the
white
blur
*NL*
from
the
window
;
a
pause
of
shifting
and
eternal
shadows
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
almost
think
you
forget
you
're
a
girl

''
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
was
startled
and
a
little
annoyed
.
``
I
'm
*NL*
twenty-nine
,
''
she
remarked
.
``
That
not
so
wildly
girlish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Wilcox
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
makes
you
say
that
?
Do
you
mean
that
I
have
been
*NL*
gauche
and
rude
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
shake
of
the
head
.
``
I
only
meant
that
I
am
fifty-one
,
*NL*
and
that
to
me
both
of
you

Read
it
all
in
some
book

other
;
I
can
not
put
things
clearly

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
've
got
it

inexperience

I
'm
no
better
than
*NL*
Helen
,
you
mean
,
and
yet
I
presume
to
advise
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
You
have
got
it
.
Inexperience
is
the
word
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Inexperience
,
''
repeated
Margaret
,
in
serious
yet
*NL*
buoyant
tones
.
``
Of
course
,
I
have
everything
to
*NL*
learn
--
absolutely
everything
--
just
as
much
as
Helen
.
Life
's
*NL*
very
difficult
and
full
of
surprises
.
At
all
events
,
I
've
*NL*
got
as
far
as
that
.
To
be
humble
and
kind
,
to
go
straight
*NL*
ahead
,
to
love
people
rather
than
pity
them
,
to
remember
the
*NL*
submerged
--
well

one
ca
n't
do
all
these
things
at
once

*NL*
worse
luck
,
because
they
're
so
contradictory
.
It
's
then
*NL*
that
proportion
comes
in
--
to
live
by
proportion
.
Do
n't
*NL*
BEGIN
with
proportion
.
Only
prigs
do
that
.
Let
proportion
*NL*
come
in
as
a
last
resource
,
when
the
better
things
have
*NL*
failed

and
a
deadlock

Gracious
me
,
I
've
started
preaching
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
you
put
the
difficulties
of
life
splendidly
,
''
*NL*
said
Mrs.
Wilcox
,
withdrawing
her
hand
into
the
deeper
*NL*
shadows
.
``
It
is
just
what
I
should
have
liked
to
say
about
*NL*
them
myself

*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
9
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Wilcox
can
not
be
accused
of
giving
Margaret
much
*NL*
information
about
life
.
And
Margaret
,
on
the
other
hand
,
*NL*
has
made
a
fair
show
of
modesty
,
and
has
pretended
to
an
*NL*
inexperience
that
she
certainly
did
not
feel
.
She
had
kept
*NL*
house
for
over
ten
years
;
she
had
entertained
,
almost
with
*NL*
distinction
;
she
had
brought
up
a
charming
sister
,
and
was
*NL*
bringing
up
a
brother
.
Surely
,
if
experience
is
attainable
,
*NL*
she
had
attained
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
the
little
luncheon-party
that
she
gave
in
Mrs.
*NL*
Wilcox
's
honour
was
not
a
success
.
The
new
friend
did
not
*NL*
blend
with
the
``
one
or
two
delightful
people
''
who
had
been
*NL*
asked
to
meet
her
,
and
the
atmosphere
was
one
of
polite
*NL*
bewilderment
.
Her
tastes
were
simple
,
her
knowledge
of
*NL*
culture
slight
,
and
she
was
not
interested
in
the
New
*NL*
English
Art
Club
,
nor
in
the
dividing-line
between
*NL*
Journalism
and
Literature
,
which
was
started
as
a
*NL*
conversational
hare
.
The
delightful
people
darted
after
it
*NL*
with
cries
of
joy
,
Margaret
leading
them
,
and
not
till
the
*NL*
meal
was
half
over
did
they
realize
that
the
principal
guest
*NL*
had
taken
no
part
in
the
chase
.
There
was
no
common
topic
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Wilcox
,
whose
life
had
been
spent
in
the
service
of
*NL*
husband
and
sons
,
had
little
to
say
to
strangers
who
had
*NL*
never
shared
it
,
and
whose
age
was
half
her
own
.
Clever
*NL*
talk
alarmed
her
,
and
withered
her
delicate
imaginings
;
it
*NL*
was
the
social
;
counterpart
of
a
motorcar
,
all
jerks
,
and
*NL*
she
was
a
wisp
of
hay
,
a
flower
.
Twice
she
deplored
the
*NL*
weather
,
twice
criticized
the
train
service
on
the
Great
*NL*
Northern
Railway
.
They
vigorously
assented
,
and
rushed
on
,
*NL*
and
when
she
inquired
whether
there
was
any
news
of
Helen
,
*NL*
her
hostess
was
too
much
occupied
in
placing
Rothenstein
to
*NL*
answer
.
The
question
was
repeated
:
``
I
hope
that
your
sister
*NL*
is
safe
in
Germany
by
now
.
''
Margaret
checked
herself
and
*NL*
said
,
``
Yes
,
thank
you
;
I
heard
on
Tuesday
.
''
But
the
demon
of
*NL*
vociferation
was
in
her
,
and
the
next
moment
she
was
off
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
on
Tuesday
,
for
they
live
right
away
at
Stettin
.
*NL*
Did
you
ever
know
any
one
living
at
Stettin
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
,
''
said
Mrs.
Wilcox
gravely
,
while
her
neighbour
,
*NL*
a
young
man
low
down
in
the
Education
Office
,
began
to
*NL*
discuss
what
people
who
lived
at
Stettin
ought
to
look
*NL*
like
.
Was
there
such
a
thing
as
Stettininity
?
Margaret
*NL*
swept
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
People
at
Stettin
drop
things
into
boats
out
of
*NL*
overhanging
warehouses
.
At
least
,
our
cousins
do
,
but
*NL*
are
n't
particularly
rich
.
The
town
is
n't
interesting
,
*NL*
except
for
a
clock
that
rolls
its
eyes
,
and
the
view
of
the
*NL*
Oder
,
which
truly
is
something
special
.
Oh
,
Mrs.
Wilcox
,
*NL*
you
would
love
the
Oder
!
The
river
,
or
rather
rivers
--
there
*NL*
seem
to
be
dozens
of
them
--
are
intense
blue
,
and
the
plain
*NL*
they
run
through
an
intensest
green
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
!
That
sounds
like
a
most
beautiful
view
,
Miss
Schlegel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
say
,
but
Helen
,
who
will
muddle
things
,
says
no
,
*NL*
it
's
like
music
.
The
course
of
the
Oder
is
to
be
like
*NL*
music
.
It
's
obliged
to
remind
her
of
a
symphonic
poem
.
The
*NL*
part
by
the
landing-stage
is
in
B
minor
,
if
I
remember
*NL*
rightly
,
but
lower
down
things
get
extremely
mixed
.
There
*NL*
is
a
slodgy
theme
in
several
keys
at
once
,
meaning
*NL*
mud-banks
,
and
another
for
the
navigable
canal
,
and
the
exit
*NL*
into
the
Baltic
is
in
C
sharp
major
,
pianissimo
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
the
overhanging
warehouses
make
of
that
?
''
asked
*NL*
the
man
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
make
a
great
deal
of
it
,
''
replied
Margaret
,
*NL*
unexpectedly
rushing
off
on
a
new
track
.
``
I
think
it
's
*NL*
affectation
to
compare
the
Oder
to
music
,
and
so
do
you
,
but
*NL*
the
overhanging
warehouses
of
Stettin
take
beauty
seriously
,
*NL*
which
we
do
n't
,
and
the
average
Englishman
does
n't
,
and
*NL*
despises
all
who
do
.
Now
do
n't
say
`
Germans
have
no
taste
,
'
*NL*
or
I
shall
scream
.
They
have
n't
.
But
--
but
--
such
a
*NL*
tremendous
but
!
--
they
take
poetry
seriously
.
They
do
take
*NL*
poetry
seriously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
anything
gained
by
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
.
The
German
is
always
on
the
lookout
for
*NL*
beauty
.
He
may
miss
it
through
stupidity
,
or
misinterpret
*NL*
it
,
but
he
is
always
asking
beauty
to
enter
his
life
,
and
I
*NL*
believe
that
in
the
end
it
will
come
.
At
Heidelberg
I
met
a
*NL*
fat
veterinary
surgeon
whose
voice
broke
with
sobs
as
he
*NL*
repeated
some
mawkish
poetry
.
So
easy
for
me
to
laugh
--
I
,
*NL*
who
never
repeat
poetry
,
good
or
bad
,
and
can
not
remember
*NL*
one
fragment
of
verse
to
thrill
myself
with
.
My
blood
*NL*
boils
--
well
,
I
'm
half
German
,
so
put
it
down
to
*NL*
patriotism
--
when
I
listen
to
the
tasteful
contempt
of
the
*NL*
average
islander
for
things
Teutonic
,
whether
they
're
*NL*
Bocklin
or
my
veterinary
surgeon
.
`
Oh
,
Bocklin
,
'
they
say
;
*NL*
`
he
strains
after
beauty
,
he
peoples
Nature
with
gods
too
*NL*
consciously
.
'
Of
course
Bocklin
strains
,
because
he
wants
*NL*
something
--
beauty
and
all
the
other
intangible
gifts
that
*NL*
are
floating
about
the
world
.
So
his
landscapes
do
n't
come
*NL*
off
,
and
Leader
's
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
sure
that
I
agree
.
Do
you
?
''
said
he
,
turning
*NL*
to
Mrs.
Wilcox
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
replied
:
``
I
think
Miss
Schlegel
puts
everything
*NL*
splendidly
''
;
and
a
chill
fell
on
the
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Mrs.
Wilcox
,
say
something
nicer
than
that
.
It
's
*NL*
such
a
snub
to
be
told
you
put
things
splendidly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
mean
it
as
a
snub
.
Your
last
speech
*NL*
interested
me
so
much
.
Generally
people
do
not
seem
quite
*NL*
to
like
Germany
.
I
have
long
wanted
to
hear
what
is
said
on
*NL*
the
other
side
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
other
side
?
Then
you
do
disagree
.
Oh
,
good
!
Give
*NL*
us
your
side
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
side
.
But
my
husband
''
--
her
voice
softened
,
*NL*
the
chill
increased
--
``
has
very
little
faith
in
the
*NL*
Continent
,
and
our
children
have
all
taken
after
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
what
grounds
?
Do
they
feel
that
the
Continent
is
in
*NL*
bad
form
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Wilcox
had
no
idea
;
she
paid
little
attention
to
*NL*
grounds
.
She
was
not
intellectual
,
nor
even
alert
,
and
it
*NL*
was
odd
that
,
all
the
same
,
she
should
give
the
idea
of
*NL*
greatness
.
Margaret
,
zigzagging
with
her
friends
over
*NL*
Thought
and
Art
,
was
conscious
of
a
personality
that
*NL*
transcended
their
own
and
dwarfed
their
activities
.
There
*NL*
was
no
bitterness
in
Mrs.
Wilcox
;
there
was
not
even
*NL*
criticism
;
she
was
lovable
,
and
no
ungracious
or
*NL*
uncharitable
word
had
passed
her
lips
.
Yet
she
and
daily
*NL*
life
were
out
of
focus
:
one
or
the
other
must
show
blurred
.
*NL*
And
at
lunch
she
seemed
more
out
of
focus
than
usual
,
and
*NL*
nearer
the
line
that
divides
life
from
a
life
that
may
be
of
*NL*
greater
importance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
admit
,
though
,
that
the
Continent
--
it
seems
*NL*
silly
to
speak
of
`
the
Continent
,
'
but
really
it
is
all
more
*NL*
like
itself
than
any
part
of
it
is
like
England
.
England
is
*NL*
unique
.
Do
have
another
jelly
first
.
I
was
going
to
say
*NL*
that
the
Continent
,
for
good
or
for
evil
,
is
interested
in
*NL*
ideas
.
Its
Literature
and
Art
have
what
one
might
call
the
*NL*
kink
of
the
unseen
about
them
,
and
this
persists
even
*NL*
through
decadence
and
affectation
.
There
is
more
liberty
of
*NL*
action
in
England
,
but
for
liberty
of
thought
go
to
*NL*
bureaucratic
Prussia
.
People
will
there
discuss
with
*NL*
humility
vital
questions
that
we
here
think
ourselves
too
*NL*
good
to
touch
with
tongs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
want
to
go
to
Prussian
''
said
Mrs.
Wilcox
--
``
not
*NL*
even
to
see
that
interesting
view
that
you
were
describing
.
*NL*
And
for
discussing
with
humility
I
am
too
old
.
We
never
*NL*
discuss
anything
at
Howards
End
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
ought
to
!
''
said
Margaret
.
``
Discussion
keeps
a
*NL*
house
alive

It
can
not
stand
by
bricks
and
mortar
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
can
not
stand
without
them
,
''
said
Mrs.
Wilcox
,
*NL*
unexpectedly
catching
on
to
the
thought
,
and
rousing
,
for
*NL*
the
first
and
last
time
,
a
faint
hope
in
the
breasts
of
the
*NL*
delightful
people
.
``
It
can
not
stand
without
them
,
and
I
*NL*
sometimes
think
--
But
I
can
not
expect
your
generation
to
*NL*
agree
,
for
even
my
daughter
disagrees
with
me
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
us
or
her
.
Do
say
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
sometimes
think
that
it
is
wiser
to
leave
action
and
*NL*
discussion
to
men
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
little
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
admits
that
the
arguments
against
the
suffrage
are
*NL*
extraordinarily
strong
,
''
said
a
girl
opposite
,
leaning
*NL*
forward
and
crumbling
her
bread
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
they
?
I
never
follow
any
arguments

I
am
only
too
*NL*
thankful
not

*NL*
*NL*
``
We
did

the
vote

supplied
*NL*
Margaret
.
``
Are
n't
we
differing
on
something
much
wider

Mrs.
Wilcox
?
Whether
women
are

been
since
the
dawn
of
history
;
or
whether
,
since
men
have
*NL*
moved
forward
so
far
,
they
too
may
move
forward
a
little
*NL*
now
.
I
say
they
may

I
would
even
admit
a
biological
change
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know

I
do
n't

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
be
getting
back
to
my
overhanging
warehouse

''
*NL*
said
the
man
.
``
They
've
turned
disgracefully
strict

*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Wilcox
also
rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

but
come
upstairs
for
a
little

I
'll
see
you
out

Wo
n't
*NL*

even
have
coffee

''
*NL*
*NL*
They
left
the
dining-room
,
closing
the
door
behind
them
,
*NL*
and
as
Mrs.
Wilcox
buttoned
up
her
jacket
,
she
said
:
``
What
*NL*
an
interesting
life
you
all
lead
in
London
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
we
do
n't
,
''
said
Margaret
,
with
a
sudden
revulsion
.
*NL*
``
We
lead
the
lives
of
gibbering
monkeys

Mrs.
*NL*
Wilcox
--
really
--
We
have
something
quiet
and
stable
at
the
*NL*
bottom
.
We
really
have
.
All
my
friends
have
.
Do
n't
*NL*
pretend
you
enjoyed
lunch
,
for
you
loathed
it
,
but
forgive
*NL*
me
by
coming
again
,
alone
,
or
by
asking
me
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
used
to
young
people
,
''
said
Mrs.
Wilcox
,
and
with
*NL*
each
word
she
spoke
the
outlines
of
known
things
grew
dim
.
*NL*
``
I
hear
a
great
deal
of
chatter
at
home
,
for
we
,
like
you
,
*NL*
entertain
a
great
deal
.
With
us
it
is
more
sport
and
*NL*
politics
,
but
--
I
enjoyed
my
lunch
very
much
,
Miss
Schlegel
,
*NL*
dear
,
and
am
not
pretending
,
and
only
wish
I
could
have
*NL*
joined
in
more
.
For
one
thing
,
I
'm
not
particularly
well
*NL*
just
today
.
For
another
,
you
younger
people
move
so
quickly
*NL*
that
it
dazes
me
.
Charles
is
the
same
,
Dolly
the
same
.
But
*NL*
we
are
all
in
the
same
boat
,
old
and
young

I
never
forget
that

''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
silent
for
a
moment
.
Then
,
with
a
newborn
*NL*
emotion
,
they
shook
hands
.
The
conversation
ceased
suddenly
*NL*
when
Margaret
re-entered
the
dining-room
:
her
friends
had
*NL*
been
talking
over
her
new
friend
,
and
had
dismissed
her
as
*NL*
uninteresting

Chapter
10
*NL*
*NL*
Several
days
passed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Was
Mrs.
Wilcox
one
of
the
unsatisfactory
people
--
there
*NL*
are
many
of
them
--
who
dangle
intimacy
and
then
withdraw
it
?
*NL*
They
evoke
our
interests
and
affections
,
and
keep
the
life
*NL*
of
the
spirit
dawdling
round
them
.
Then
they
withdraw
.
*NL*
When
physical
passion
is
involved
,
there
is
a
definite
name
*NL*
for
such
behaviour
--
flirting
--
and
if
carried
far
enough
it
*NL*
is
punishable
by
law
.
But
no
law
--
not
public
opinion
*NL*
even
--
punishes
those
who
coquette
with
friendship
,
though
*NL*
the
dull
ache
that
they
inflict
,
the
sense
of
misdirected
*NL*
effort
and
exhaustion
,
may
be
as
intolerable
.
Was
she
one
*NL*
of
these
?
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
feared
so
at
first
,
for
,
with
a
Londoner
's
*NL*
impatience
,
she
wanted
everything
to
be
settled
up
*NL*
immediately
.
She
mistrusted
the
periods
of
quiet
that
are
*NL*
essential
to
true
growth
.
Desiring
to
book
Mrs.
Wilcox
as
a
*NL*
friend
,
she
pressed
on
the
ceremony
,
pencil
,
as
it
were
,
in
*NL*
hand
,
pressing
the
more
because
the
rest
of
the
family
were
*NL*
away
,
and
the
opportunity
seemed
favourable
.
But
the
elder
*NL*
woman
would
not
be
hurried
.
She
refused
to
fit
in
with
the
*NL*
Wickham
Place
set
,
or
to
reopen
discussion
of
Helen
and
*NL*
Paul
,
whom
Margaret
would
have
utilized
as
a
short-cut
.
She
*NL*
took
her
time
,
or
perhaps
let
time
take
her
,
and
when
the
*NL*
crisis
did
come
all
was
ready
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
crisis
opened
with
a
message
:
would
Miss
Schlegel
*NL*
come
shopping
?
Christmas
was
nearing
,
and
Mrs.
Wilcox
felt
*NL*
behind-hand
with
the
presents
.
She
had
taken
some
more
days
*NL*
in
bed
,
and
must
make
up
for
lost
time
.
Margaret
accepted
,
*NL*
and
at
eleven
o'clock
one
cheerless
morning
they
started
out
*NL*
in
a
brougham
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
First
of
all
,
''
began
Margaret
,
``
we
must
make
a
list
and
*NL*
tick
off
the
people
's
names
.
My
aunt
always
does
,
and
this
*NL*
fog
may
thicken
up
any
moment
.
Have
you
any
ideas
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
we
would
go
to
Harrod
's
or
the
Haymarket
*NL*
Stores
,
''
said
Mrs.
Wilcox
rather
hopelessly
.
``
Everything
is
*NL*
sure
to
be
there
.
I
am
not
a
good
shopper
.
The
din
is
so
*NL*
confusing
,
and
your
aunt
is
quite
right
--
one
ought
to
make
a
*NL*
list
.
Take
my
notebook
,
then
,
and
write
your
own
name
at
*NL*
the
top
of
the
page
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
hooray
!
''
said
Margaret
,
writing
it
.
``
How
very
kind
*NL*
of
you
to
start
with
me
!
''
But
she
did
not
want
to
receive
*NL*
anything
expensive
.
Their
acquaintance
was
singular
rather
*NL*
than
intimate
,
and
she
divined
that
the
Wilcox
clan
would
*NL*
resent
any
expenditure
on
outsiders
;
the
more
compact
*NL*
families
do
.
She
did
not
want
to
be
thought
a
second
Helen
,
*NL*
who
would
snatch
presents
since
she
could
not
snatch
young
*NL*
men
,
nor
to
be
exposed
,
like
a
second
Aunt
Juley
,
to
the
*NL*
insults
of
Charles
.
A
certain
austerity
of
demeanour
was
*NL*
best
,
and
she
added
:
``
I
do
n't
really
want
a
Yuletide
gift
,
*NL*
though
.
In
fact
,
I
'd
rather
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
've
odd
ideas
about
Christmas
.
Because
I
have
*NL*
all
that
money
can
buy
.
I
want
more
people
,
but
no
more
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
to
give
you
something
worth
your
*NL*
acquaintance
,
Miss
Schlegel
,
in
memory
of
your
kindness
to
*NL*
me
during
my
lonely
fortnight
.
It
has
so
happened
that
I
*NL*
have
been
left
alone
,
and
you
have
stopped
me
from
*NL*
brooding
.
I
am
too
apt
to
brood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
that
is
so
,
''
said
Margaret
,
``
if
I
have
happened
to
*NL*
be
of
use
to
you
,
which
I
did
n't
know
,
you
can
not
pay
me
*NL*
back
with
anything
tangible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
I
suppose
not
,
but
one
would
like
to
.
Perhaps
I
shall
*NL*
think
of
something
as
we
go
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
name
remained
at
the
head
of
the
list
,
but
nothing
*NL*
was
written
opposite
it
.
They
drove
from
shop
to
shop
.
The
*NL*
air
was
white
,
and
when
they
alighted
it
tasted
like
cold
*NL*
pennies
.
At
times
they
passed
through
a
clot
of
grey
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Wilcox
's
vitality
was
low
that
morning
,
and
it
was
Margaret
*NL*
who
decided
on
a
horse
for
this
little
girl
,
a
golliwog
for
*NL*
that
,
for
the
rector
's
wife
a
copper
warming-tray
.
``
We
*NL*
always
give
the
servants
money
.
''
``
Yes
,
do
you
,
yes
,
much
*NL*
easier
,
''
replied
Margaret
,
but
felt
the
grotesque
impact
of
*NL*
the
unseen
upon
the
seen
,
and
saw
issuing
from
a
forgotten
*NL*
manger
at
Bethlehem
this
torrent
of
coins
and
toys
.
*NL*
Vulgarity
reigned
.
Public-houses
,
besides
their
usual
*NL*
exhortation
against
temperance
reform
,
invited
men
to
``
Join
*NL*
our
Christmas
goose
club
''
--
one
bottle
of
gin
,
etc.
,
or
two
,
*NL*
according
to
subscription
.
A
poster
of
a
woman
in
tights
*NL*
heralded
the
Christmas
pantomime
,
and
little
red
devils
,
who
*NL*
had
come
in
again
that
year
,
were
prevalent
upon
the
*NL*
Christmas-cards
.
Margaret
was
no
morbid
idealist
.
She
did
*NL*
not
wish
this
spate
of
business
and
self-advertisement
*NL*
checked
.
It
was
only
the
occasion
of
it
that
struck
her
*NL*
with
amazement
annually
.
How
many
of
these
vacillating
*NL*
shoppers
and
tired
shop-assistants
realized
that
it
was
a
*NL*
divine
event
that
drew
them
together
?
She
realized
it
,
*NL*
though
standing
outside
in
the
matter
.
She
was
not
a
*NL*
Christian
in
the
accepted
sense
;
she
did
not
believe
that
*NL*
God
had
ever
worked
among
us
as
a
young
artisan
.
These
*NL*
people
,
or
most
of
them
,
believed
it
,
and
if
pressed
,
would
*NL*
affirm
it
in
words
.
But
the
visible
signs
of
their
belief
*NL*
were
Regent
Street
or
Drury
Lane
,
a
little
mud
displaced
,
a
*NL*
little
money
spent
,
a
little
food
cooked
,
eaten
,
and
*NL*
forgotten
.
Inadequate
.
But
in
public
who
shall
express
the
*NL*
unseen
adequately
?
It
is
private
life
that
holds
out
the
*NL*
mirror
to
infinity
;
personal
intercourse
,
and
that
alone
,
*NL*
that
ever
hints
at
a
personality
beyond
our
daily
vision
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
like
Christmas
on
the
whole
,
''
she
announced
.
*NL*
``
In
its
clumsy
way
,
it
does
approach
Peace
and
Goodwill
.
*NL*
But
oh
,
it
is
clumsier
every
year
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
?
I
am
only
used
to
country
Christmases
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
usually
in
London
,
and
play
the
game
with
*NL*
vigour
--
carols
at
the
Abbey
,
clumsy
midday
meal
,
clumsy
*NL*
dinner
for
the
maids
,
followed
by
Christmas-tree
and
dancing
*NL*
of
poor
children
,
with
songs
from
Helen
.
The
drawing-room
*NL*
does
very
well
for
that
.
We
put
the
tree
in
the
*NL*
powder-closet
,
and
draw
a
curtain
when
the
candles
are
*NL*
lighted
,
and
with
the
looking-glass
behind
it
looks
quite
*NL*
pretty
.
I
wish
we
might
have
a
powder-closet
in
our
next
*NL*
house

Of
course
,
the
tree
has
to
be
very
small
,
and
the
*NL*
presents
do
n't
hang
on
it

No

the
presents
reside
in
a

sort
of
rocky

crumpled

She
broke
off
,
for
they
had
reached
the
stationery
*NL*
department
of
the
Haymarket
Stores
,
and
Mrs.
Wilcox
wanted
*NL*
to
order
some
private
greeting
cards
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
possible
,
something
distinctive

''
she
sighed
.
At
*NL*
the
counter
she
found
a
friend
,
bent
on
the
same
errand
,
and
*NL*
conversed
with
her
insipidly
,
wasting
much
time
.
``
My
*NL*
husband
and
our
daughter
are
motoring
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bertha
too

Oh
,
fancy
,
what
a
coincidence
!
''
Margaret
,
*NL*
though
not
practical
,
could
shine
in
such
company
as
this
.
*NL*
While
they
talked
,
she
went
through
a
volume
of
specimen
*NL*
cards
,
and
submitted
one
for
Mrs.
Wilcox
's
inspection
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Wilcox
was
delighted
--
so
original
,
words
so
sweet
;
she
would
*NL*
order
a
hundred
like
that
,
and
could
never
be
sufficiently
*NL*
grateful
.
Then
,
just
as
the
assistant
was
booking
the
*NL*
order
,
she
said
:
``
Do
you
know
,
I
'll
wait
.
On
second
*NL*
thoughts
,
I
'll
wait
.
There
's
plenty
of

still

and
I
shall
be
able
to
get
Evie
's
opinion

''
*NL*
*NL*
They
returned
to
the
carriage
by
devious
paths
;
when
*NL*
they
were
in
,
she
said
,
``
But
could
n't
you
get
it
renewed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon

asked
Margaret
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
something

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

*NL*
``

Then
she
said
vehemently
:

It

My

I
am
so
sorry

''
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
did
not
know
what
to
say
.
Mrs.
Wilcox
had
been
*NL*
overtired
by
the
shopping
,
and
was
inclined
to
hysteria
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Howards
End

nearly
pulled
down
once

It

have
*NL*
killed

*NL*
*NL*
``
Howards

be
a
very

are
fond
of
ours

there
is
nothing
distinctive
about
*NL*
it

As
you
saw
,
it
is
an
ordinary
London
house

We
shall
*NL*
easily
find
another

*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
think

*NL*
*NL*
``
Again
my
lack
of
experience

I
suppose

said
Margaret
,
*NL*
easing
away
from
the
subject
.
``
I
ca
n't
say
anything
when

you

up

Mrs.
Wilcox

see

myself

me

foreshortened
into

backfisch

ingenue

Very
charming

wonderfully
well
read
for
my

age

incapable

*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Wilcox
would
not
be
deterred
.
``
Come
down
with
me
*NL*
to
Howards
End
now

''
she
said
,
more
vehemently
than
ever
.
*NL*
``
I
want
you
to
see
it

about
it

for
you
do
put
things
so
wonderfully

*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
glanced
at
the
pitiless
air
and
then
at
the
*NL*
tired
face
of
her
companion
.
``
Later
on
I
should
love
it

''
*NL*
she
continued
,
``
but
it
's
hardly
the
weather

an

expedition

start

fresh

Is
n't
*NL*
the
house
shut
up

too
?

*NL*
*NL*
She
received
no
answer
.
Mrs.
Wilcox
appeared
to
be
annoyed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Might
I
come
some
other
day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Wilcox
bent
forward
and
tapped
the
glass
.
``
Back
to
*NL*
Wickham
Place
,
please
!
''
was
her
order
to
the
coachman
.
*NL*
Margaret
had
been
snubbed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
thousand
thanks
,
Miss
Schlegel
,
for
all
your
help

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
such
a
comfort
to
get
the
presents
off
my
*NL*
mind
--
the
Christmas-cards
especially
.
I
do
admire
your
choice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
her
turn
to
receive
no
answer
.
In
her
turn
*NL*
Margaret
became
annoyed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
husband
and
Evie
will
be
back
the
day
after
*NL*
tomorrow
.
That
is
why
I
dragged
you
out
shopping
today
.
I
*NL*
stayed
in
town
chiefly
to
shop
,
but
got
through
nothing
,
and
*NL*
now
he
writes
that
they
must
cut
their
tour
short
,
the
*NL*
weather
is
so
bad
,
and
the
police-traps
have
been
so
*NL*
bad
--
nearly
as
bad
as
in
Surrey
.
Ours
is
such
a
careful
*NL*
chauffeur
,
and
my
husband
feels
it
particularly
hard
that
*NL*
they
should
be
treated
like
roadhogs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
naturally
he
--
he
is
n't
a
road-hog
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
exceeding
the
speed-limit
,
I
conclude
.
He
must
*NL*
expect
to
suffer
with
the
lower
animals
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Wilcox
was
silenced
.
In
growing
discomfort
they
*NL*
drove
homewards
.
The
city
seemed
Satanic
,
the
narrower
*NL*
streets
oppressing
like
the
galleries
of
a
mine
.
No
harm
*NL*
was
done
by
the
fog
to
trade
,
for
it
lay
high
,
and
the
*NL*
lighted
windows
of
the
shops
were
thronged
with
customers
.
*NL*
It
was
rather
a
darkening
of
the
spirit
which
fell
back
upon
*NL*
itself
,
to
find
a
more
grievous
darkness
within
.
Margaret
*NL*
nearly
spoke
a
dozen
times
,
but
something
throttled
her
.
*NL*
She
felt
petty
and
awkward
,
and
her
meditations
on
Christmas
*NL*
grew
more
cynical
.
Peace
?
It
may
bring
other
gifts
,
but
is
*NL*
there
a
single
Londoner
to
whom
Christmas
is
peaceful
?
The
*NL*
craving
for
excitement
and
for
elaboration
has
ruined
that
*NL*
blessing
.
Goodwill
?
Had
she
seen
any
example
of
it
in
the
*NL*
hordes
of
purchasers
?
Or
in
herself
.
She
had
failed
to
*NL*
respond
to
this
invitation
merely
because
it
was
a
little
*NL*
queer
and
imaginative
--
she
,
whose
birthright
it
was
to
*NL*
nourish
imagination
!
Better
to
have
accepted
,
to
have
tired
*NL*
themselves
a
little
by
the
journey
,
than
coldly
to
reply
,
*NL*
``
Might
I
come
some
other
day
?
''
Her
cynicism
left
her
.
*NL*
There
would
be
no
other
day
.
This
shadowy
woman
would
never
*NL*
ask
her
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
parted
at
the
Mansions
.
Mrs.
Wilcox
went
in
after
*NL*
due
civilities
,
and
Margaret
watched
the
tall
,
lonely
figure
*NL*
sweep
up
the
hall
to
the
lift
.
As
the
glass
doors
closed
on
*NL*
it
she
had
the
sense
of
an
imprisonment
.
The
beautiful
head
*NL*
disappeared
first
,
still
buried
in
the
muff
,
the
long
*NL*
trailing
skirt
followed
.
A
woman
of
undefinable
rarity
was
*NL*
going
up
heaven-ward
,
like
a
specimen
in
a
bottle
.
And
into
*NL*
what
a
heaven
--
a
vault
as
of
hell
,
sooty
black
,
from
which
*NL*
soots
descended
!
*NL*
*NL*
At
lunch
her
brother
,
seeing
her
inclined
for
silence
,
*NL*
insisted
on
talking
.
Tibby
was
not
ill-natured
,
but
from
*NL*
babyhood
something
drove
him
to
do
the
unwelcome
and
the
*NL*
unexpected
.
Now
he
gave
her
a
long
account
of
the
*NL*
day-school
that
he
sometimes
patronized
.
The
account
was
*NL*
interesting
,
and
she
had
often
pressed
him
for
it
before
,
*NL*
but
she
could
not
attend
now
,
for
her
mind
was
focussed
on
*NL*
the
invisible
.
She
discerned
that
Mrs.
Wilcox
,
though
a
*NL*
loving
wife
and
mother
,
had
only
one
passion
in
life
--
her
*NL*
house
--
and
that
the
moment
was
solemn
when
she
invited
a
*NL*
friend
to
share
this
passion
with
her
.
To
answer
``
another
*NL*
day
''
was
to
answer
as
a
fool
.
``
Another
day
''
will
do
for
*NL*
brick
and
mortar
,
but
not
for
the
Holy
of
Holies
into
which
*NL*
Howards
End
had
been
transfigured
.
Her
own
curiosity
was
*NL*
slight
.
She
had
heard
more
than
enough
about
it
in
the
*NL*
summer
.
The
nine
windows
,
the
vine
,
and
the
wych-elm
had
no
*NL*
pleasant
connections
for
her
,
and
she
would
have
preferred
*NL*
to
spend
the
afternoon
at
a
concert
.
But
imagination
*NL*
triumphed
.
While
her
brother
held
forth
she
determined
to
*NL*
go
,
at
whatever
cost
,
and
to
compel
Mrs.
Wilcox
to
go
,
too
.
*NL*
When
lunch
was
over
she
stepped
over
to
the
flats
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Wilcox
had
just
gone
away
for
the
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
said
that
it
was
of
no
consequence
,
hurried
*NL*
downstairs
,
and
took
a
hansom
to
King
's
Cross
.
She
was
*NL*
convinced
that
the
escapade
was
important
,
though
it
would
*NL*
have
puzzled
her
to
say
why
.
There
was
a
question
of
*NL*
imprisonment
and
escape
,
and
though
she
did
not
know
the
*NL*
time
of
the
train
,
she
strained
her
eyes
for
the
St.
*NL*
Pancras
'
clock
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
clock
of
King
's
Cross
swung
into
sight
,
a
*NL*
second
moon
in
that
infernal
sky
,
and
her
cab
drew
up
at
the
*NL*
station
.
There
was
a
train
for
Hilton
in
five
minutes
.
She
*NL*
took
a
ticket
,
asking
in
her
agitation
for
a
single
.
As
she
*NL*
did
so
,
a
grave
and
happy
voice
saluted
her
and
thanked
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
come
if
I
still
may
,
''
said
Margaret
,
laughing
nervously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
coming
to
sleep
,
dear
,
too
.
It
is
in
the
*NL*
morning
that
my
house
is
most
beautiful
.
You
are
coming
to
*NL*
stop
.
I
can
not
show
you
my
meadow
properly
except
at
*NL*
sunrise

These
fogs

--
she
pointed
at
the
station
*NL*
roof
--
``
never
spread
far

I
dare
say
they
are
sitting
in
the
*NL*
sun
in
Hertfordshire
,
and
you
will
never
repent
joining
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
never
repent
joining
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
the
same

''
*NL*
*NL*
They
began
the
walk
up
the
long
platform
.
Far
at
its
*NL*
end
stood
the
train
,
breasting
the
darkness
without
.
They
*NL*
never
reached
it
.
Before
imagination
could
triumph
,
there
*NL*
were
cries
of
``
Mother
!
Mother
!
''
and
a
heavy-browed
girl
*NL*
darted
out
of
the
cloak-room
and
seized
Mrs.
Wilcox
by
the
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Evie
!
''
she
gasped
.
``
Evie
,
my
pet
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
called
,
``
Father
!
I
say
!
look
who
's
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Evie
,
dearest
girl
,
why
are
n't
you
in
Yorkshire
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

changed
plans

Father
's
coming

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

Ruth
!
''
cried
Mr.
Wilcox
,
joining
them
.
``
What
in
*NL*
the
name
of
all
that
's
wonderful
are
you
doing
here
,
Ruth

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Wilcox
had
recovered
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Henry
dear
!
--
here
's
a
lovely
surprise

but
let
me
*NL*
introduce

but
I
think
you
know
Miss
Schlegel

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
''
he
replied
,
not
greatly
interested
.
``
But
*NL*
how
's
yourself
,
Ruth
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fit
as
a
fiddle

she
answered
gaily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
are
we
and
so
was
our
car
,
which
ran
A-1
as
far

a
wretched
horse

``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Another

Mrs.
Wilcox

Of
course

*NL*
*NL*

But

third
party
risks

it

Cart

practically
at

*NL*
*NL*
The
voices
of
the
happy
family
rose
high
.
Margaret
was
*NL*
left
alone
.
No
one
wanted
her
.
Mrs.
Wilcox
walked
out
of
*NL*
King
's
Cross
between
her
husband
and
her
daughter
,
listening
*NL*
to
both
of
them
.

Chapter
11
*NL*
*NL*
The
funeral
was
over
.
The
carriages
rolled
away
through
the
*NL*
soft
mud
,
and
only
the
poor
remained
.
They
approached
to
*NL*
the
newly-dug
shaft
and
looked
their
last
at
the
coffin
,
now
*NL*
almost
hidden
beneath
the
spadefuls
of
clay
.
It
was
their
*NL*
moment
.
Most
of
them
were
women
from
the
dead
woman
's
*NL*
district
,
to
whom
black
garments
had
been
served
out
by
Mr.
*NL*
Wilcox
's
orders
.
Pure
curiosity
had
brought
others
.
They
*NL*
thrilled
with
the
excitement
of
a
death
,
and
of
a
rapid
*NL*
death
,
and
stood
in
groups
or
moved
between
the
graves
,
like
*NL*
drops
of
ink
.
The
son
of
one
of
them
,
a
wood-cutter
,
was
*NL*
perched
high
above
their
heads
,
pollarding
one
of
the
*NL*
churchyard
elms
.
From
where
he
sat
he
could
see
the
village
*NL*
of
Hilton
,
strung
upon
the
North
Road
,
with
its
accreting
*NL*
suburbs
;
the
sunset
beyond
,
scarlet
and
orange
,
winking
at
*NL*
him
beneath
brows
of
grey
;
the
church
;
the
plantations
;
and
*NL*
behind
him
an
unspoilt
country
of
fields
and
farms
.
But
he
,
*NL*
too
,
was
rolling
the
event
luxuriously
in
his
mouth
.
He
*NL*
tried
to
tell
his
mother
down
below
all
that
he
had
felt
*NL*
when
he
saw
the
coffin
approaching
:
how
he
could
not
leave
*NL*
his
work
,
and
yet
did
not
like
to
go
on
with
it
;
how
he
had
*NL*
almost
slipped
out
of
the
tree
,
he
was
so
upset
;
the
rooks
*NL*
had
cawed
,
and
no
wonder
--
it
was
as
if
rooks
knew
too
.
His
*NL*
mother
claimed
the
prophetic
power
herself
--
she
had
seen
a
*NL*
strange
look
about
Mrs.
Wilcox
for
some
time
.
London
had
*NL*
done
the
mischief
,
said
others
.
She
had
been
a
kind
lady
;
*NL*
her
grandmother
had
been
kind
,
too
--
a
plainer
person
,
but
*NL*
very
kind
.
Ah
,
the
old
sort
was
dying
out
!
Mr.
Wilcox
,
he
*NL*
was
a
kind
gentleman
.
They
advanced
to
the
topic
again
and
*NL*
again
,
dully
,
but
with
exaltation
.
The
funeral
of
a
rich
*NL*
person
was
to
them
what
the
funeral
of
Alcestis
or
Ophelia
*NL*
is
to
the
educated
.
It
was
Art
;
though
remote
from
life
,
it
*NL*
enhanced
life
's
values
,
and
they
witnessed
it
avidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
grave-diggers
,
who
had
kept
up
an
undercurrent
of
*NL*
disapproval
--
they
disliked
Charles
;
it
was
not
a
moment
to
*NL*
speak
of
such
things
,
but
they
did
not
like
Charles
*NL*
Wilcox
--
the
grave-diggers
finished
their
work
and
piled
up
*NL*
the
wreaths
and
crosses
above
it
.
The
sun
set
over
Hilton
:
*NL*
the
grey
brows
of
the
evening
flushed
a
little
,
and
were
*NL*
cleft
with
one
scarlet
frown
.
Chattering
sadly
to
each
*NL*
other
,
the
mourners
passed
through
the
lych-gate
and
*NL*
traversed
the
chestnut
avenues
that
led
down
to
the
*NL*
village
.
The
young
wood-cutter
stayed
a
little
longer
,
*NL*
poised
above
the
silence
and
swaying
rhythmically
.
At
last
*NL*
the
bough
fell
beneath
his
saw
.
With
a
grunt
,
he
descended
,
*NL*
his
thoughts
dwelling
no
longer
on
death
,
but
on
love
,
for
*NL*
he
was
mating
.
He
stopped
as
he
passed
the
new
grave
;
a
*NL*
sheaf
of
tawny
chrysanthemums
had
caught
his
eye
.
``
They
*NL*
did
n't
ought
to
have
coloured
flowers
at
buryings
,
''
he
*NL*
reflected
.
Trudging
on
a
few
steps
,
he
stopped
again
,
*NL*
looked
furtively
at
the
dusk
,
turned
back
,
wrenched
a
*NL*
chrysanthemum
from
the
sheaf
,
and
hid
it
in
his
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
him
came
silence
absolute
.
The
cottage
that
*NL*
abutted
on
the
churchyard
was
empty
,
and
no
other
house
*NL*
stood
near
.
Hour
after
hour
the
scene
of
the
interment
*NL*
remained
without
an
eye
to
witness
it
.
Clouds
drifted
over
*NL*
it
from
the
west
;
or
the
church
may
have
been
a
ship
,
*NL*
high-prowed
,
steering
with
all
its
company
towards
*NL*
infinity
.
Towards
morning
the
air
grew
colder
,
the
sky
*NL*
clearer
,
the
surface
of
the
earth
hard
and
sparkling
above
*NL*
the
prostrate
dead
.
The
wood-cutter
,
returning
after
a
*NL*
night
of
joy
,
reflected
:
``
They
lilies
,
they
chrysants
;
it
's
*NL*
a
pity
I
did
n't
take
them
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Up
at
Howards
End
they
were
attempting
breakfast
.
*NL*
Charles
and
Evie
sat
in
the
dining-room
,
with
Mrs.
Charles
.
*NL*
Their
father
,
who
could
not
bear
to
see
a
face
,
breakfasted
*NL*
upstairs
.
He
suffered
acutely
.
Pain
came
over
him
in
*NL*
spasms
,
as
if
it
was
physical
,
and
even
while
he
was
about
*NL*
to
eat
,
his
eyes
would
fill
with
tears
,
and
he
would
lay
*NL*
down
the
morsel
untasted
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
remembered
his
wife
's
even
goodness
during
thirty
*NL*
years
.
Not
anything
in
detail
--
not
courtship
or
early
*NL*
raptures
--
but
just
the
unvarying
virtue
,
that
seemed
to
him
*NL*
a
woman
's
noblest
quality
.
So
many
women
are
capricious
,
*NL*
breaking
into
odd
flaws
of
passion
or
frivolity
.
Not
so
his
*NL*
wife
.
Year
after
year
,
summer
and
winter
,
as
bride
and
*NL*
mother
,
she
had
been
the
same
,
he
had
always
trusted
her
.
*NL*
Her
tenderness
!
Her
innocence
!
The
wonderful
innocence
*NL*
that
was
hers
by
the
gift
of
God
.
Ruth
knew
no
more
of
*NL*
worldly
wickedness
and
wisdom
than
did
the
flowers
in
her
*NL*
garden
,
or
the
grass
in
her
field
.
Her
idea
of
*NL*
business
--
``
Henry
,
why
do
people
who
have
enough
money
try
to
*NL*
get
more
money
?
''
Her
idea
of
politics
--
``
I
am
sure
that
if
*NL*
the
mothers
of
various
nations
could
meet
,
there
would
be
no
*NL*
more
wars
.
''
Her
idea
of
religion
--
ah
,
this
had
been
a
cloud
,
*NL*
but
a
cloud
that
passed
.
She
came
of
Quaker
stock
,
and
he
*NL*
and
his
family
,
formerly
Dissenters
,
were
now
members
of
the
*NL*
Church
of
England
.
The
rector
's
sermons
had
at
first
*NL*
repelled
her
,
and
she
had
expressed
a
desire
for
``
a
more
*NL*
inward
light
,
''
adding
,
``
not
so
much
for
myself
as
for
baby
''
*NL*
-LRB-
Charles
-RRB-
.
Inward
light
must
have
been
granted
,
for
he
*NL*
heard
no
complaints
in
later
years
.
They
brought
up
their
*NL*
three
children
without
dispute
.
They
had
never
disputed
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
lay
under
the
earth
now
.
She
had
gone
,
and
as
if
to
*NL*
make
her
going
the
more
bitter
,
had
gone
with
a
touch
of
*NL*
mystery
that
was
all
unlike
her
.
``
Why
did
n't
you
tell
me
*NL*
you
knew
of
it
?
''
he
had
moaned
,
and
her
faint
voice
had
*NL*
answered
:
``
I
did
n't
want
to
,
Henry
--
I
might
have
been
*NL*
wrong
--
and
every
one
hates
illnesses
.
''
He
had
been
told
of
*NL*
the
horror
by
a
strange
doctor
,
whom
she
had
consulted
*NL*
during
his
absence
from
town
.
Was
this
altogether
just
?
*NL*
Without
fully
explaining
,
she
had
died
.
It
was
a
fault
on
*NL*
her
part
,
and
--
tears
rushed
into
his
eyes
--
what
a
little
*NL*
fault
!
It
was
the
only
time
she
had
deceived
him
in
those
*NL*
thirty
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
rose
to
his
feet
and
looked
out
of
the
window
,
for
*NL*
Evie
had
come
in
with
the
letters
,
and
he
could
meet
no
*NL*
one
's
eye
.
Ah
yes
--
she
had
been
a
good
woman
--
she
had
been
*NL*
steady
.
He
chose
the
word
deliberately
.
To
him
steadiness
*NL*
included
all
praise
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
himself
,
gazing
at
the
wintry
garden
,
is
in
*NL*
appearance
a
steady
man
.
His
face
was
not
as
square
as
his
*NL*
son
's
,
and
,
indeed
,
the
chin
,
though
firm
enough
in
outline
,
*NL*
retreated
a
little
,
and
the
lips
,
ambiguous
,
were
curtained
*NL*
by
a
moustache
.
But
there
was
no
external
hint
of
*NL*
weakness
.
The
eyes
,
if
capable
of
kindness
and
*NL*
goodfellowship
,
if
ruddy
for
the
moment
with
tears
,
were
the
*NL*
eyes
of
one
who
could
not
be
driven
.
The
forehead
,
too
,
was
*NL*
like
Charles
's
.
High
and
straight
,
brown
and
polished
,
*NL*
merging
abruptly
into
temples
and
skull
,
it
has
the
effect
*NL*
of
a
bastion
that
protected
his
head
from
the
world
.
At
*NL*
times
it
had
the
effect
of
a
blank
wall
.
He
had
dwelt
*NL*
behind
it
,
intact
and
happy
,
for
fifty
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
post
's
come
,
Father
,
''
said
Evie
awkwardly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks
.
Put
it
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
the
breakfast
been
all
right
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
thanks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
glanced
at
him
and
at
it
with
constraint
.
She
*NL*
did
not
know
what
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Charles
says
do
you
want
the
TIMES
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
'll
read
it
later
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ring
if
you
want
anything
,
Father
,
wo
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
all
I
want
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Having
sorted
the
letters
from
the
circulars
,
she
went
*NL*
back
to
the
dining-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
's
eaten
nothing
,
''
she
announced
,
sitting
down
*NL*
with
wrinkled
brows
behind
the
tea-urn
--
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
did
not
answer
,
but
after
a
moment
he
ran
*NL*
quickly
upstairs
,
opened
the
door
,
and
said
:
``
Look
here
,
*NL*
Father
,
you
must
eat
,
you
know
''
;
and
having
paused
for
a
*NL*
reply
that
did
not
come
,
stole
down
again
.
``
He
's
going
to
*NL*
read
his
letters
first
,
I
think
,
''
he
said
evasively
;
``
I
dare
*NL*
say
he
will
go
on
with
his
breakfast
afterwards
.
''
Then
he
*NL*
took
up
the
TIMES
,
and
for
some
time
there
was
no
sound
*NL*
except
the
clink
of
cup
against
saucer
and
of
knife
on
plate
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Mrs.
Charles
sat
between
her
silent
companions
,
*NL*
terrified
at
the
course
of
events
,
and
a
little
bored
.
She
*NL*
was
a
rubbishy
little
creature
,
and
she
knew
it
.
A
telegram
*NL*
had
dragged
her
from
Naples
to
the
death-bed
of
a
woman
whom
*NL*
she
had
scarcely
known
.
A
word
from
her
husband
had
plunged
*NL*
her
into
mourning
.
She
desired
to
mourn
inwardly
as
well
,
*NL*
but
she
wished
that
Mrs.
Wilcox
,
since
fated
to
die
,
could
*NL*
have
died
before
the
marriage
,
for
then
less
would
have
been
*NL*
expected
of
her
.
Crumbling
her
toast
,
and
too
nervous
to
*NL*
ask
for
the
butter
,
she
remained
almost
motionless
,
thankful
*NL*
only
for
this
,
that
her
father-in-law
was
having
his
*NL*
breakfast
upstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
Charles
spoke
.
``
They
had
no
business
to
be
*NL*
pollarding
those
elms
yesterday
,
''
he
said
to
his
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
indeed
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
make
a
note
of
that
,
''
he
continued
.
``
I
am
*NL*
surprised
that
the
rector
allowed
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
it
may
not
be
the
rector
's
affair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whose
else
could
it
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
lord
of
the
manor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Impossible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Butter
,
Dolly
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
Evie
dear

Charles
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
dear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
know
one
could
pollard
elms
.
I
thought
one
*NL*
only
pollarded
willows
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
one
can
pollard
elms
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
ought
n't
the
elms
in
the
churchyard
to
be
pollarded
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
frowned
a
little
,
and
turned
again
to
his
*NL*
sister
.
``
Another
point
.
I
must
speak
to
Chalkeley
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
rather
;
you
must
complain
to
Chalkeley
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
no
good
him
saying
he
is
not
responsible
for
those
*NL*
men
.
He
is
responsible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
rather
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Brother
and
sister
were
not
callous
.
They
spoke
thus
,
*NL*
partly
because
they
desired
to
keep
Chalkeley
up
to
the
*NL*
mark
--
a
healthy
desire
in
its
way
--
partly
because
they
*NL*
avoided
the
personal
note
in
life
.
All
Wilcoxes
did
.
It
*NL*
did
not
seem
to
them
of
supreme
importance
.
Or
it
may
be
as
*NL*
Helen
supposed
:
they
realized
its
importance
,
but
were
*NL*
afraid
of
it
.
Panic
and
emptiness
,
could
one
glance
behind
.
*NL*
They
were
not
callous
,
and
they
left
the
breakfast-table
*NL*
with
aching
hearts
.
Their
mother
never
had
come
in
to
*NL*
breakfast
.
It
was
in
the
other
rooms
,
and
especially
in
the
*NL*
garden
,
that
they
felt
her
loss
most
.
As
Charles
went
out
*NL*
to
the
garage
,
he
was
reminded
at
every
step
of
the
woman
*NL*
who
had
loved
him
and
whom
he
could
never
replace
.
What
*NL*
battles
he
had
fought
against
her
gentle
conservatism
!
How
*NL*
she
had
disliked
improvements
,
yet
how
loyally
she
had
*NL*
accepted
them
when
made
!
He
and
his
father
--
what
trouble
*NL*
they
had
had
to
get
this
very
garage
!
With
what
difficulty
*NL*
had
they
persuaded
her
to
yield
them
to
the
paddock
for
*NL*
it
--
the
paddock
that
she
loved
more
dearly
than
the
garden
*NL*
itself
!
The
vine
--
she
had
got
her
way
about
the
vine
.
It
*NL*
still
encumbered
the
south
wall
with
its
unproductive
*NL*
branches
.
And
so
with
Evie
,
as
she
stood
talking
to
the
*NL*
cook
.
Though
she
could
take
up
her
mother
's
work
inside
the
*NL*
house
,
just
as
the
man
could
take
it
up
without
,
she
felt
*NL*
that
something
unique
had
fallen
out
of
her
life
.
Their
*NL*
grief
,
though
less
poignant
than
their
father
's
,
grew
from
*NL*
deeper
roots
,
for
a
wife
may
be
replaced
;
a
mother
never
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
would
go
back
to
the
office
.
There
was
little
*NL*
to
do
at
Howards
End
.
The
contents
of
his
mother
's
will
had
*NL*
been
long
known
to
them
.
There
were
no
legacies
,
no
*NL*
annuities
,
none
of
the
posthumous
bustle
with
which
some
of
*NL*
the
dead
prolong
their
activities
.
Trusting
her
husband
,
*NL*
she
had
left
him
everything
without
reserve
.
She
was
quite
*NL*
a
poor
woman
--
the
house
had
been
all
her
dowry
,
and
the
*NL*
house
would
come
to
Charles
in
time
.
Her
water-colours
Mr.
*NL*
Wilcox
intended
to
reserve
for
Paul
,
while
Evie
would
take
*NL*
the
jewellery
and
lace
.
How
easily
she
slipped
out
of
*NL*
life
!
Charles
thought
the
habit
laudable
,
though
he
did
not
*NL*
intend
to
adopt
it
himself
,
whereas
Margaret
would
have
seen
*NL*
in
it
an
almost
culpable
indifference
to
earthly
fame
.
*NL*
Cynicism
--
not
the
superficial
cynicism
that
snarls
and
*NL*
sneers
,
but
the
cynicism
that
can
go
with
courtesy
and
*NL*
tenderness
--
that
was
the
note
of
Mrs.
Wilcox
's
will
.
She
*NL*
wanted
not
to
vex
people
.
That
accomplished
,
the
earth
*NL*
might
freeze
over
her
for
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
,
there
was
nothing
for
Charles
to
wait
for
.
He
could
*NL*
not
go
on
with
his
honeymoon
,
so
he
would
go
up
to
London
*NL*
and
work
--
he
felt
too
miserable
hanging
about
.
He
and
Dolly
*NL*
would
have
the
furnished
flat
while
his
father
rested
*NL*
quietly
in
the
country
with
Evie
.
He
could
also
keep
an
eye
*NL*
on
his
own
little
house
,
which
was
being
painted
and
*NL*
decorated
for
him
in
one
of
the
Surrey
suburbs
,
and
in
which
*NL*
he
hoped
to
install
himself
soon
after
Christmas
.
Yes
,
he
*NL*
would
go
up
after
lunch
in
his
new
motor
,
and
the
town
*NL*
servants
,
who
had
come
down
for
the
funeral
,
would
go
up
by
train
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
found
his
father
's
chauffeur
in
the
garage
,
said
,
*NL*
``
Morning
''
without
looking
at
the
man
's
face
,
and
,
bending
*NL*
over
the
car
,
continued
:
``
Hullo
!
my
new
car
's
been
driven
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
it
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Charles
,
getting
rather
red
;
``
and
whoever
's
*NL*
driven
it
has
n't
cleaned
it
properly
,
for
there
's
mud
on
the
*NL*
axle
.
Take
it
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
went
for
the
cloths
without
a
word
.
He
was
a
*NL*
chauffeur
as
ugly
as
sin
--
not
that
this
did
him
disservice
*NL*
with
Charles
,
who
thought
charm
in
a
man
rather
rot
,
and
had
*NL*
soon
got
rid
of
the
little
Italian
beast
with
whom
they
had
started
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Charles
--
''
His
bride
was
tripping
after
him
over
the
*NL*
hoar-frost
,
a
dainty
black
column
,
her
little
face
and
*NL*
elaborate
mourning
hat
forming
the
capital
thereof
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
minute
,
I
'm
busy
.
Well
,
Crane

who
's

it

you
suppose

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do

No

been
back

but
,
of

,
there
's
the
fortnight
I
've
*NL*
been
away
with
the
other
car
in
Yorkshire
.

*NL*
*NL*
The
mud
came
off
easily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Charles
,
your
father
's
down

Something

*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait

Who

key

the
*NL*
garage

*NL*
*NL*
``
The

*NL*
*NL*
``

Yorkshire

mud
now

''
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
was
vexed
.
The
man
was
treating
him
as
a
fool
,
*NL*
and
if
his
heart
had
not
been
so
heavy
he
would
have
*NL*
reported
him
to
his
father
.
But
it
was
not
a
morning
for
*NL*
complaints
.
Ordering
the
motor
to
be
round
after
lunch
,
he
*NL*
joined
his
wife
,
who
had
all
the
while
been
pouring
out
some
*NL*
incoherent
story
about
a
letter
and
a
Miss
Schlegel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Dolly
,
I
can
attend
to
you
.
Miss
Schlegel
?
What
*NL*
does
she
want
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
people
wrote
a
letter
Charles
always
asked
what
*NL*
they
wanted
.
Want
was
to
him
the
only
cause
of
action
.
And
*NL*
the
question
in
this
case
was
correct
,
for
his
wife
replied
,
*NL*
``
She
wants
Howards
End
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Howards
End
?
Now
,
Crane
,
just
do
n't
forget
to

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

*NL*
*NL*
``
Now

you

n't

''
*NL*
When
they
were
out
of
the
chauffeur
's
sight
he
put
his
arm
*NL*
around
her
waist
and
pressed
her
against
him
.
All
his
*NL*
affection
and
half
his
attention
--
it
was
what
he
granted
her
*NL*
throughout
their
happy
married
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you

n't
listened

Charles

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*

``

asked
Charles

unclasping
her

*NL*
*NL*

``

*NL*
``

''
she
screamed
,
mimicking
him
,
and
as
she
*NL*
did
so
Evie
came
dashing
out
of
the
shrubbery
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dolly

go
back
at

My

much

she
hit
herself
wildly
--
``
come

*NL*
Father

He
's
had
a
letter

too
awful

*NL*
*NL*
Charles
began
to
run
,
but
checked
himself
,
and
stepped
*NL*
heavily
across
the
gravel
path
.
There
the
house
was
--
the
*NL*
nine
windows
,
the
unprolific
vine
.
He
exclaimed
,
``
Schlegels
*NL*
again
!
''
and
as
if
to
complete
chaos
,
Dolly
said
,
``
Oh
no
,

*NL*
matron

the
nursing
home

written

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come

cried
his

no
longer
*NL*
inert

``

why
have

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

Mr.
Wilcox

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
in
the
porch
,
transformed
,
letters
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Into

dining-room

Here

here
;
read
these

See
what
you
make

''
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
took
two
letters
,
and
read
them
as
he
followed
*NL*
the
procession
.
The
first
was
a
covering
note
from
the
*NL*
matron
.
Mrs.
Wilcox
had
desired
her
,
when
the
funeral
*NL*
should
be
over
,
to
forward
the
enclosed
.
The
enclosed
--
it
*NL*
was
from
his
mother
herself
.
She
had
written
:
``
To
my
*NL*
husband
:
I
should
like
Miss
Schlegel
-LRB-
Margaret
-RRB-
to
have
*NL*
Howards
End
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
we
're
going
to
have
a
talk
about
this
?
''
he
*NL*
remarked
,
ominously
calm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
.
I
was
coming
out
to
you
when
Dolly
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
let
's
sit
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
Evie
,
do
n't
waste
time
,
sit
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
silence
they
drew
up
to
the
breakfast-table
.
The
*NL*
events
of
yesterday
--
indeed
,
of
this
morning
--
suddenly
*NL*
receded
into
a
past
so
remote
that
they
seemed
scarcely
to
*NL*
have
lived
in
it
.
Heavy
breathings
were
heard
.
They
were
*NL*
calming
themselves
.
Charles
,
to
steady
them
further
,
read
*NL*
the
enclosure
out
loud
:
``
A
note
in
my
mother
's
handwriting

*NL*
in
an
envelope
addressed

sealed

:

*NL*
No
date
,
no
signature
.
Forwarded
through
the
matron
of
that
*NL*
nursing
home
.
Now
,
the
question
is
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dolly
interrupted
him
.
``
But
I
say
that
note
is
n't
*NL*
legal
.
Houses
ought
to
be
done
by
a
lawyer
,
Charles
,
surely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
husband
worked
his
jaw
severely
.
Little
lumps
*NL*
appeared
in
front
of
either
ear
--
a
symptom
that
she
had
not
*NL*
yet
learnt
to
respect
,
and
she
asked
whether
she
might
see
*NL*
the
note
.
Charles
looked
at
his
father
for
permission
,
who
*NL*
said
abstractedly
,
``
Give
it
her
.
''
She
seized
it
,
and
at
once
*NL*
exclaimed
:
``
Why
,
it
's
only
in
pencil
!
I
said
so
.
Pencil
*NL*
never
counts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
know
that
it
is
not
legally
binding
,
Dolly
,
''
said
*NL*
Mr.
Wilcox
,
speaking
from
out
of
his
fortress
.
``
We
are
*NL*
aware
of
that
.
Legally
,
I
should
be
justified
in
tearing
it
*NL*
up
and
throwing
it
into
the
fire
.
Of
course
,
my
dear
,
we
*NL*
consider
you
as
one
of
the
family
,
but
it
will
be
better
if
*NL*
you
do
not
interfere
with
what
you
do
not
understand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
,
vexed
both
with
his
father
and
his
wife
,
then
*NL*
repeated
:
``
The
question
is
--
''
He
had
cleared
a
space
of
the
*NL*
breakfast-table
from
plates
and
knives
,
so
that
he
could
*NL*
draw
patterns
on
the
tablecloth
.
``
The
question
is
whether
*NL*
Miss
Schlegel
,
during
the
fortnight
we
were
all
away
,
*NL*
whether
she
unduly
--
''
He
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
that
,
''
said
his
father
,
whose
nature
was
*NL*
nobler
than
his
son
's
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
think
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
she
would
have
--
that
it
is
a
case
of
undue
*NL*
influence
.
No
,
to
my
mind
the
question
is
the
--
the
*NL*
invalid
's
condition
at
the
time
she
wrote
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
father
,
consult
an
expert
if
you
like
,
but
I
*NL*
do
n't
admit
it
is
my
mother
's
writing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
just
said
it
was
!
''
cried
Dolly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
if
I
did
,
''
he
blazed
out
;
``
and
hold
your
tongue
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
little
wife
coloured
at
this
,
and
,
drawing
her
*NL*
handkerchief
from
her
pocket
,
shed
a
few
tears
.
No
one
*NL*
noticed
her
.
Evie
was
scowling
like
an
angry
boy
.
The
two
*NL*
men
were
gradually
assuming
the
manner
of
the
*NL*
committee-room
.
They
were
both
at
their
best
when
serving
*NL*
on
committees
.
They
did
not
make
the
mistake
of
handling
*NL*
human
affairs
in
the
bulk
,
but
disposed
of
them
item
by
*NL*
item
,
sharply
.
Calligraphy
was
the
item
before
them
now
,
*NL*
and
on
it
they
turned
their
well-trained
brains
.
Charles
,
*NL*
after
a
little
demur
,
accepted
the
writing
as
genuine
,
and
*NL*
they
passed
on
to
the
next
point
.
It
is
the
best
--
perhaps
*NL*
the
only
--
way
of
dodging
emotion
.
They
were
the
average
*NL*
human
article
,
and
had
they
considered
the
note
as
a
whole
*NL*
it
would
have
driven
them
miserable
or
mad
.
Considered
item
*NL*
by
item
,
the
emotional
content
was
minimized
,
and
all
went
*NL*
forward
smoothly
.
The
clock
ticked
,
the
coals
blazed
*NL*
higher
,
and
contended
with
the
white
radiance
that
poured
in
*NL*
through
the
windows
.
Unnoticed
,
the
sun
occupied
his
sky
,
*NL*
and
the
shadows
of
the
tree
stems
,
extraordinarily
solid
,
*NL*
fell
like
trenches
of
purple
across
the
frosted
lawn
.
It
*NL*
was
a
glorious
winter
morning
.
Evie
's
fox
terrier
,
who
had
*NL*
passed
for
white
,
was
only
a
dirty
grey
dog
now
,
so
intense
*NL*
was
the
purity
that
surrounded
him
.
He
was
discredited
,
but
*NL*
the
blackbirds
that
he
was
chasing
glowed
with
Arabian
*NL*
darkness
,
for
all
the
conventional
colouring
of
life
had
*NL*
been
altered
.
Inside
,
the
clock
struck
ten
with
a
rich
and
*NL*
confident
note
.
Other
clocks
confirmed
it
,
and
the
*NL*
discussion
moved
towards
its
close
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
follow
it
is
unnecessary
.
It
is
rather
a
moment
when
*NL*
the
commentator
should
step
forward
.
Ought
the
Wilcoxes
to
*NL*
have
offered
their
home
to
Margaret
?
I
think
not
.
The
*NL*
appeal
was
too
flimsy
.
It
was
not
legal
;
it
had
been
*NL*
written
in
illness
,
and
under
the
spell
of
a
sudden
*NL*
friendship
;
it
was
contrary
to
the
dead
woman
's
intentions
*NL*
in
the
past
,
contrary
to
her
very
nature
,
so
far
as
that
*NL*
nature
was
understood
by
them
.
To
them
Howards
End
was
a
*NL*
house
:
they
could
not
know
that
to
her
it
had
been
a
spirit
,
*NL*
for
which
she
sought
a
spiritual
heir
.
And
--
pushing
one
*NL*
step
farther
in
these
mists
--
may
they
not
have
decided
even
*NL*
better
than
they
supposed
?
Is
it
credible
that
the
*NL*
possessions
of
the
spirit
can
be
bequeathed
at
all
?
Has
the
*NL*
soul
offspring
?
A
wych-elm
tree
,
a
vine
,
a
wisp
of
hay
with
*NL*
dew
on
it
--
can
passion
for
such
things
be
transmitted
where
*NL*
there
is
no
bond
of
blood
?
No
;
the
Wilcoxes
are
not
to
be
*NL*
blamed
.
The
problem
is
too
terrific
,
and
they
could
not
*NL*
even
perceive
a
problem
.
No
;
it
is
natural
and
fitting
that
*NL*
after
due
debate
they
should
tear
the
note
up
and
throw
it
*NL*
on
to
their
dining-room
fire
.
The
practical
moralist
may
*NL*
acquit
them
absolutely
.
He
who
strives
to
look
deeper
may
*NL*
acquit
them
--
almost
.
For
one
hard
fact
remains
.
They
did
*NL*
neglect
a
personal
appeal
.
The
woman
who
had
died
did
say
*NL*
to
them
,
``
Do
this
,
''
and
they
answered
,
``
We
will
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
incident
made
a
most
painful
impression
on
them
.
*NL*
Grief
mounted
into
the
brain
and
worked
there
*NL*
disquietingly
.
Yesterday
they
had
lamented
:
``
She
was
a
dear
*NL*
mother
,
a
true
wife
:
in
our
absence
she
neglected
her
health
*NL*
and
died
.
''
Today
they
thought
:
``
She
was
not
as
true
,
as
*NL*
dear
,
as
we
supposed
.
''
The
desire
for
a
more
inward
light
*NL*
had
found
expression
at
last
,
the
unseen
had
impacted
on
the
*NL*
seen
,
and
all
that
they
could
say
was
``
Treachery
.
''
Mrs.
*NL*
Wilcox
had
been
treacherous
to
the
family
,
to
the
laws
of
*NL*
property
,
to
her
own
written
word
.
How
did
she
expect
*NL*
Howards
End
to
be
conveyed
to
Miss
Schlegel
?
Was
her
*NL*
husband
,
to
whom
it
legally
belonged
,
to
make
it
over
to
her
*NL*
as
a
free
gift
?
Was
the
said
Miss
Schlegel
to
have
a
life
*NL*
interest
in
it
,
or
to
own
it
absolutely
?
Was
there
to
be
no
*NL*
compensation
for
the
garage
and
other
improvements
that
they
*NL*
had
made
under
the
assumption
that
all
would
be
theirs
some
*NL*
day
?
Treacherous
!
treacherous
and
absurd
!
When
we
think
*NL*
the
dead
both
treacherous
and
absurd
,
we
have
gone
far
*NL*
towards
reconciling
ourselves
to
their
departure
.
That
*NL*
note
,
scribbled
in
pencil
,
sent
through
the
matron
,
was
*NL*
unbusinesslike
as
well
as
cruel
,
and
decreased
at
once
the
*NL*
value
of
the
woman
who
had
written
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
well
!
''
said
Mr.
Wilcox
,
rising
from
the
table
.
``
I
*NL*
should
n't
have
thought
it
possible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
could
n't
have
meant
it
,
''
said
Evie
,
still
frowning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
my
girl
,
of
course
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
believed
so
in
ancestors
too
--
it
is
n't
like
her
*NL*
to
leave
anything
to
an
outsider
,
who
'd
never
appreciate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
whole
thing
is
unlike
her
,
''
he
announced
.
``
If
Miss
*NL*
Schlegel
had
been
poor
,
if
she
had
wanted
a
house
,
I
could
*NL*
understand
it
a
little
.
But
she
has
a
house
of
her
own
.
*NL*
Why
should
she
want
another
?
She
would
n't
have
any
use
of
*NL*
Howards
End
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
time
may
prove
,
''
murmured
Charles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
?
''
asked
his
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Presumably
she
knows

mother
will
have
told
her

She
*NL*
got
twice
or
three
times

home

Presumably
*NL*
she
is
awaiting
developments

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
horrid
woman
!

And
Dolly
,
who
had
recovered
,
*NL*
cried
,
``
Why
,
she
may
be
coming
down
to
turn
us
out
now

''
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
put
her
right
.
``
I
wish
she
would

''
he
said
*NL*
ominously
.
``
I
could
then
deal
with
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
could
I
,
''
echoed
his
father
,
who
was
feeling
rather
*NL*
in
the
cold
.
Charles
had
been
kind
in
undertaking
the
*NL*
funeral
arrangements
and
in
telling
him
to
eat
his
*NL*
breakfast
,
but
the
boy
as
he
grew
up
was
a
little
*NL*
dictatorial
,
and
assumed
the
post
of
chairman
too
readily
.
*NL*
``
I
could
deal
with
her
,
if
she
comes
,
but
she
wo
n't
come
.
*NL*
You
're
all
a
bit
hard
on
Miss
Schlegel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
Paul
business
was
pretty
scandalous
,
though
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
no
more
of
the
Paul
business
,
Charles
,
as
I
said
*NL*
at
the
time
,
and
besides
,
it
is
quite
apart
from
this
*NL*
business
.
Margaret
Schlegel
has
been
officious
and
tiresome
*NL*
during
this
terrible
week
,
and
we
have
all
suffered
under
*NL*
her
,
but
upon
my
soul
she
's
honest
.
She
's
not
in
collusion
*NL*
with
the
matron
.
I
'm
absolutely
certain
of
it
.
Nor
was
she
*NL*
with
the
doctor

I
'm
equally
certain
of
that

She
did
not
*NL*
hide
anything
from
us

for
up
to
that
very
afternoon
she
was
*NL*
as
ignorant
as
we
are

ourselves

was
a
dupe

He
stopped
for
a
moment

``
You
see
,
Charles

in
her
terrible
*NL*
pain
your
poor
mother
put
us
all

you

gone

I
into
Yorkshire

if
only
we
had
known

*NL*
Well
,
Miss
Schlegel
's
position
has
been
equally
false
.
Take
*NL*
all
in
all
,
she
has
not
come
out
of
it
badly

*NL*
*NL*
Evie
said
:
``
But
those
chrysanthemums

Dolly

Why

She
had

certainly
we

not
have
sent
such
flowers

they
may
have
seemed
the
right

Evie

for

all
you

the
custom
in
Germany

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
forget
she
is
n't
really
English

cried
Evie

*NL*
``
That
would
explain
a
lot

*NL*
*NL*
``
She

Charles

looking
at
his

watch

rather
down

cosmopolitans

doubtless

a
German

the
limit

think

's
about
all

it

I
want

run
down

``
In

not
worth

having
a
row

''
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
and
his
father
sometimes
disagreed
.
But
they
*NL*
always
parted
with
an
increased
regard
for
one
another
,
and
*NL*
each
desired
no
doughtier
comrade
when
it
was
necessary
to
*NL*
voyage
for
a
little
past
the
emotions
.
So
the
sailors
of
*NL*
Ulysses
voyaged
past
the
Sirens
,
having
first
stopped
one
*NL*
another

ears
with
wool

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
12
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
need
not
have
been
anxious
.
Miss
Schlegel
had
never
*NL*
heard
of
his
mother
's
strange
request
.
She
was
to
hear
of
*NL*
it
in
after
years
,
when
she
had
built
up
her
life
*NL*
differently
,
and
it
was
to
fit
into
position
as
the
*NL*
headstone
of
the
corner
.
Her
mind
was
bent
on
other
*NL*
questions
now
,
and
by
her
also
it
would
have
been
rejected
*NL*
as
the
fantasy
of
an
invalid
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
parting
from
these
Wilcoxes
for
the
second
*NL*
time
.
Paul
and
his
mother
,
ripple
and
great
wave
,
had
*NL*
flowed
into
her
life
and
ebbed
out
of
it
for
ever
.
The
*NL*
ripple
had
left
no
traces
behind
:
the
wave
had
strewn
at
her
*NL*
feet
fragments
torn
from
the
unknown
.
A
curious
seeker
,
she
*NL*
stood
for
a
while
at
the
verge
of
the
sea
that
tells
so
*NL*
little
,
but
tells
a
little
,
and
watched
the
outgoing
of
this
*NL*
last
tremendous
tide
.
Her
friend
had
vanished
in
agony
,
but
*NL*
not
,
she
believed
,
in
degradation
.
Her
withdrawal
had
*NL*
hinted
at
other
things
besides
disease
and
pain
.
Some
leave
*NL*
our
life
with
tears
,
others
with
an
insane
frigidity
;
Mrs.
*NL*
Wilcox
had
taken
the
middle
course
,
which
only
rarer
natures
*NL*
can
pursue
.
She
had
kept
proportion
.
She
had
told
a
little
*NL*
of
her
grim
secret
to
her
friends
,
but
not
too
much
;
she
had
*NL*
shut
up
her
heart
--
almost
,
but
not
entirely
.
It
is
thus
,
if
*NL*
there
is
any
rule
,
that
we
ought
to
die
--
neither
as
victim
*NL*
nor
as
fanatic
,
but
as
the
seafarer
who
can
greet
with
an
*NL*
equal
eye
the
deep
that
he
is
entering
,
and
the
shore
that
*NL*
he
must
leave
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
last
word
--
whatever
it
would
be
--
had
certainly
not
*NL*
been
said
in
Hilton
churchyard
.
She
had
not
died
there
.
A
*NL*
funeral
is
not
death
,
any
more
than
baptism
is
birth
or
*NL*
marriage
union
.
All
three
are
the
clumsy
devices
,
coming
*NL*
now
too
late
,
now
too
early
,
by
which
Society
would
register
*NL*
the
quick
motions
of
man
.
In
Margaret
's
eyes
Mrs.
Wilcox
*NL*
had
escaped
registration
.
She
had
gone
out
of
life
vividly
,
*NL*
her
own
way
,
and
no
dust
was
so
truly
dust
as
the
contents
*NL*
of
that
heavy
coffin
,
lowered
with
ceremonial
until
it
*NL*
rested
on
the
dust
of
the
earth
,
no
flowers
so
utterly
*NL*
wasted
as
the
chrysanthemums
that
the
frost
must
have
*NL*
withered
before
morning
.
Margaret
had
once
said
she
``
loved
*NL*
superstition
.
''
It
was
not
true
.
Few
women
had
tried
more
*NL*
earnestly
to
pierce
the
accretions
in
which
body
and
soul
*NL*
are
enwrapped
.
The
death
of
Mrs.
Wilcox
had
helped
her
in
*NL*
her
work
.
She
saw
a
little
more
clearly
than
hitherto
what
*NL*
a
human
being
is
,
and
to
what
he
may
aspire
.
Truer
*NL*
relationships
gleamed
.
Perhaps
the
last
word
would
be
*NL*
hope
--
hope
even
on
this
side
of
the
grave
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
she
could
take
an
interest
in
the
survivors
.
*NL*
In
spite
of
her
Christmas
duties
,
in
spite
of
her
brother
,
*NL*
the
Wilcoxes
continued
to
play
a
considerable
part
in
her
*NL*
thoughts
.
She
had
seen
so
much
of
them
in
the
final
week
.
*NL*
They
were
not
``
her
sort
,
''
they
were
often
suspicious
and
*NL*
stupid
,
and
deficient
where
she
excelled
;
but
collision
with
*NL*
them
stimulated
her
,
and
she
felt
an
interest
that
verged
*NL*
into
liking
,
even
for
Charles
.
She
desired
to
protect
them
,
*NL*
and
often
felt
that
they
could
protect
her
,
excelling
where
*NL*
she
was
deficient
.
Once
past
the
rocks
of
emotion
,
they
*NL*
knew
so
well
what
to
do
,
whom
to
send
for
;
their
hands
were
*NL*
on
all
the
ropes
,
they
had
grit
as
well
as
grittiness
,
and
*NL*
she
valued
grit
enormously
.
They
led
a
life
that
she
could
*NL*
not
attain
to
--
the
outer
life
of
``
telegrams
and
anger
,
''
*NL*
which
had
detonated
when
Helen
and
Paul
had
touched
in
June
,
*NL*
and
had
detonated
again
the
other
week
.
To
Margaret
this
*NL*
life
was
to
remain
a
real
force
.
She
could
not
despise
it
,
*NL*
as
Helen
and
Tibby
affected
to
do
.
It
fostered
such
virtues
*NL*
as
neatness
,
decision
,
and
obedience
,
virtues
of
the
second
*NL*
rank
,
no
doubt
,
but
they
have
formed
our
civilization
.
They
*NL*
form
character
,
too
;
Margaret
could
not
doubt
it
:
they
keep
*NL*
the
soul
from
becoming
sloppy
.
How
dare
Schlegels
despise
*NL*
Wilcoxes
,
when
it
takes
all
sorts
to
make
a
world
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
brood
too
much
,
''
she
wrote
to
Helen
,
``
on
the
*NL*
superiority
of
the
unseen
to
the
seen
.
It
's
true
,
but
to
*NL*
brood
on
it
is
mediaeval
.
Our
business
is
not
to
contrast
*NL*
the
two
,
but
to
reconcile
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Helen
replied
that
she
had
no
intention
of
brooding
on
*NL*
such
a
dull
subject
.
What
did
her
sister
take
her
for
?
The
*NL*
weather
was
magnificent
.
She
and
the
Mosebachs
had
gone
*NL*
tobogganing
on
the
only
hill
that
Pomerania
boasted
.
It
was
*NL*
fun
,
but
overcrowded
,
for
the
rest
of
Pomerania
had
gone
*NL*
there
too
.
Helen
loved
the
country
,
and
her
letter
glowed
*NL*
with
physical
exercise
and
poetry
.
She
spoke
of
the
*NL*
scenery
,
quiet
,
yet
august
;
of
the
snow-clad
fields
,
with
*NL*
their
scampering
herds
of
deer
;
of
the
river
and
its
quaint
*NL*
entrance
into
the
Baltic
Sea
;
of
the
Oderberge
,
only
three
*NL*
hundred
feet
high
,
from
which
one
slid
all
too
quickly
back
*NL*
into
the
Pomeranian
plains
,
and
yet
these
Oderberge
were
*NL*
real
mountains
,
with
pine-forests
,
streams
,
and
views
*NL*
complete
.
``
It
is
n't
size
that
counts
so
much
as
the
way
*NL*
things
are
arranged
.
''
In
another
paragraph
she
referred
to
*NL*
Mrs.
Wilcox
sympathetically
,
but
the
news
had
not
bitten
*NL*
into
her
.
She
had
not
realized
the
accessories
of
death
,
*NL*
which
are
in
a
sense
more
memorable
than
death
itself
.
The
*NL*
atmosphere
of
precautions
and
recriminations
,
and
in
the
*NL*
midst
a
human
body
growing
more
vivid
because
it
was
in
*NL*
pain
;
the
end
of
that
body
in
Hilton
churchyard
;
the
*NL*
survival
of
something
that
suggested
hope
,
vivid
in
its
turn
*NL*
against
life
's
workaday
cheerfulness
;
--
all
these
were
lost
*NL*
to
Helen
,
who
only
felt
that
a
pleasant
lady
could
now
be
*NL*
pleasant
no
longer
.
She
returned
to
Wickham
Place
full
of
*NL*
her
own
affairs
--
she
had
had
another
proposal
--
and
Margaret
,
*NL*
after
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
was
content
that
this
should
be
*NL*
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
proposal
had
not
been
a
serious
matter
.
It
was
the
*NL*
work
of
Fraulein
Mosebach
,
who
had
conceived
the
large
and
*NL*
patriotic
notion
of
winning
back
her
cousins
to
the
*NL*
Fatherland
by
matrimony
.
England
had
played
Paul
Wilcox
,
*NL*
and
lost
;
Germany
played
Herr
Forstmeister
someone
--
Helen
*NL*
could
not
remember
his
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
Herr
Forstmeister
lived
in
a
wood
,
and
standing
on
the
*NL*
summit
of
the
Oderberge
,
he
had
pointed
out
his
house
to
*NL*
Helen
,
or
rather
,
had
pointed
out
the
wedge
of
pines
in
*NL*
which
it
lay
.
She
had
exclaimed
,
``
Oh
,
how
lovely
!
That
's
*NL*
the
place
for
me
!
''
and
in
the
evening
Frieda
appeared
in
her
*NL*
bedroom
.
``
I
have
a
message
,
dear
Helen
,
''
etc.
,
and
so
she
*NL*
had
,
but
had
been
very
nice
when
Helen
laughed
;
quite
*NL*
understood
--
a
forest
too
solitary
and
damp
--
quite
agreed
,
*NL*
but
Herr
Forstmeister
believed
he
had
assurance
to
the
*NL*
contrary
.
Germany
had
lost
,
but
with
good-humour
;
holding
*NL*
the
manhood
of
the
world
,
she
felt
bound
to
win
.
``
And
there
*NL*
will
even
be
someone
for
Tibby
,
''
concluded
Helen
.
``
There
*NL*
now
,
Tibby
,
think
of
that
;
Frieda
is
saving
up
a
little
girl
*NL*
for
you
,
in
pig-tails
and
white
worsted
stockings
,
but
the
*NL*
feet
of
the
stockings
are
pink
,
as
if
the
little
girl
had
*NL*
trodden
in
strawberries
.
I
've
talked
too
much
.
My
head
*NL*
aches
.
Now
you
talk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tibby
consented
to
talk
.
He
too
was
full
of
his
own
*NL*
affairs
,
for
he
had
just
been
up
to
try
for
a
scholarship
at
*NL*
Oxford
.
The
men
were
down
,
and
the
candidates
had
been
*NL*
housed
in
various
colleges
,
and
had
dined
in
hall
.
Tibby
*NL*
was
sensitive
to
beauty
,
the
experience
was
new
,
and
he
gave
*NL*
a
description
of
his
visit
that
was
almost
glowing
.
The
*NL*
august
and
mellow
University
,
soaked
with
the
richness
of
*NL*
the
western
counties
that
it
has
served
for
a
thousand
*NL*
years
,
appealed
at
once
to
the
boy
's
taste
:
it
was
the
kind
*NL*
of
thing
he
could
understand
,
and
he
understood
it
all
the
*NL*
better
because
it
was
empty
.
Oxford
is
--
Oxford
:
not
a
mere
*NL*
receptacle
for
youth
,
like
Cambridge
.
Perhaps
it
wants
its
*NL*
inmates
to
love
it
rather
than
to
love
one
another
:
such
at
*NL*
all
events
was
to
be
its
effect
on
Tibby
.
His
sisters
sent
*NL*
him
there
that
he
might
make
friends
,
for
they
knew
that
his
*NL*
education
had
been
cranky
,
and
had
severed
him
from
other
*NL*
boys
and
men
.
He
made
no
friends
.
His
Oxford
remained
*NL*
Oxford
empty
,
and
he
took
into
life
with
him
,
not
the
memory
*NL*
of
a
radiance
,
but
the
memory
of
a
colour
scheme
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
pleased
Margaret
to
hear
her
brother
and
sister
*NL*
talking
.
They
did
not
get
on
overwell
as
a
rule
.
For
a
few
*NL*
moments
she
listened
to
them
,
feeling
elderly
and
benign
.
*NL*
Then
something
occurred
to
her
,
and
she
interrupted
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Helen
,
I
told
you
about
poor
Mrs.
Wilcox
;
that
sad
business
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
had
a
correspondence
with
her
son
.
He
was
*NL*
winding
up
the
estate
,
and
wrote
to
ask
me
whether
his
*NL*
mother
had
wanted
me
to
have
anything
.
I
thought
it
good
of
*NL*
him
,
considering
I
knew
her
so
little
.
I
said
that
she
had
*NL*
once
spoken
of
giving
me
a
Christmas
present
,
but
we
both
*NL*
forgot
about
it
afterwards
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
Charles
took
the
hint
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
that
is
to
say
,
her
husband
wrote
later
on
,
and
*NL*
thanked
me
for
being
a
little
kind
to
her
,
and
actually
gave
*NL*
me
her
silver
vinaigrette
.
Do
n't
you
think
that
is
*NL*
extraordinarily
generous
?
It
has
made
me
like
him
very
*NL*
much
.
He
hopes
that
this
will
not
be
the
end
of
our
*NL*
acquaintance
,
but
that
you
and
I
will
go
and
stop
with
Evie
*NL*
some
time
in
the
future
.
I
like
Mr.
Wilcox
.
He
is
taking
*NL*
up
his
work
--
rubber
--
it
is
a
big
business
.
I
gather
he
is
*NL*
launching
out
rather
.
Charles
is
in
it
,
too
.
Charles
is
*NL*
married
--
a
pretty
little
creature
,
but
she
does
n't
seem
*NL*
wise
.
They
took
on
the
flat
,
but
now
they
have
gone
off
to
*NL*
a
house
of
their
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Helen
,
after
a
decent
pause
,
continued
her
account
of
*NL*
Stettin
.
How
quickly
a
situation
changes
!
In
June
she
had
*NL*
been
in
a
crisis
;
even
in
November
she
could
blush
and
be
*NL*
unnatural
;
now
it
was
January
,
and
the
whole
affair
lay
*NL*
forgotten
.
Looking
back
on
the
past
six
months
,
Margaret
*NL*
realized
the
chaotic
nature
of
our
daily
life
,
and
its
*NL*
difference
from
the
orderly
sequence
that
has
been
*NL*
fabricated
by
historians
.
Actual
life
is
full
of
false
*NL*
clues
and
sign-posts
that
lead
nowhere
.
With
infinite
*NL*
effort
we
nerve
ourselves
for
a
crisis
that
never
comes
.
*NL*
The
most
successful
career
must
show
a
waste
of
strength
*NL*
that
might
have
removed
mountains
,
and
the
most
unsuccessful
*NL*
is
not
that
of
the
man
who
is
taken
unprepared
,
but
of
him
*NL*
who
has
prepared
and
is
never
taken
.
On
a
tragedy
of
that
*NL*
kind
our
national
morality
is
duly
silent
.
It
assumes
that
*NL*
preparation
against
danger
is
in
itself
a
good
,
and
that
*NL*
men
,
like
nations
,
are
the
better
for
staggering
through
*NL*
life
fully
armed
.
The
tragedy
of
preparedness
has
scarcely
*NL*
been
handled
,
save
by
the
Greeks
.
Life
is
indeed
dangerous
,
*NL*
but
not
in
the
way
morality
would
have
us
believe
.
It
is
*NL*
indeed
unmanageable
,
but
the
essence
of
it
is
not
a
battle
.
*NL*
It
is
unmanageable
because
it
is
a
romance
,
and
its
essence
*NL*
is
romantic
beauty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
hoped
that
for
the
future
she
would
be
less
*NL*
cautious
,
not
more
cautious
,
than
she
had
been
in
the
past
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
13
*NL*
*NL*
Over
two
years
passed
,
and
the
Schlegel
household
continued
*NL*
to
lead
its
life
of
cultured
but
not
ignoble
ease
,
still
*NL*
swimming
gracefully
on
the
grey
tides
of
London
.
Concerts
*NL*
and
plays
swept
past
them
,
money
had
been
spent
and
renewed
,
*NL*
reputations
won
and
lost
,
and
the
city
herself
,
emblematic
*NL*
of
their
lives
,
rose
and
fell
in
a
continual
flux
,
while
her
*NL*
shallows
washed
more
widely
against
the
hills
of
Surrey
and
*NL*
over
the
fields
of
Hertfordshire
.
This
famous
building
had
*NL*
arisen
,
that
was
doomed
.
Today
Whitehall
had
been
*NL*
transformed
:
it
would
be
the
turn
of
Regent
Street
*NL*
tomorrow
.
And
month
by
month
the
roads
smelt
more
strongly
*NL*
of
petrol
,
and
were
more
difficult
to
cross
,
and
human
*NL*
beings
heard
each
other
speak
with
greater
difficulty
,
*NL*
breathed
less
of
the
air
,
and
saw
less
of
the
sky
.
Nature
*NL*
withdrew
:
the
leaves
were
falling
by
midsummer
;
the
sun
*NL*
shone
through
dirt
with
an
admired
obscurity
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
speak
against
London
is
no
longer
fashionable
.
The
*NL*
Earth
as
an
artistic
cult
has
had
its
day
,
and
the
*NL*
literature
of
the
near
future
will
probably
ignore
the
*NL*
country
and
seek
inspiration
from
the
town
.
One
can
*NL*
understand
the
reaction
.
Of
Pan
and
the
elemental
forces
,
*NL*
the
public
has
heard
a
little
too
much
--
they
seem
Victorian
,
*NL*
while
London
is
Georgian
--
and
those
who
care
for
the
earth
*NL*
with
sincerity
may
wait
long
ere
the
pendulum
swings
back
to
*NL*
her
again
.
Certainly
London
fascinates
.
One
visualizes
it
*NL*
as
a
tract
of
quivering
grey
,
intelligent
without
purpose
,
*NL*
and
excitable
without
love
;
as
a
spirit
that
has
altered
*NL*
before
it
can
be
chronicled
;
as
a
heart
that
certainly
*NL*
beats
,
but
with
no
pulsation
of
humanity
.
It
lies
beyond
*NL*
everything
:
Nature
,
with
all
her
cruelty
,
comes
nearer
to
us
*NL*
than
do
these
crowds
of
men
.
A
friend
explains
himself
:
the
*NL*
earth
is
explicable
--
from
her
we
came
,
and
we
must
return
to
*NL*
her
.
But
who
can
explain
Westminster
Bridge
Road
or
*NL*
Liverpool
Street
in
the
morning
--
the
city
inhaling
--
or
the
*NL*
same
thoroughfares
in
the
evening
--
the
city
exhaling
her
*NL*
exhausted
air
?
We
reach
in
desperation
beyond
the
fog
,
*NL*
beyond
the
very
stars
,
the
voids
of
the
universe
are
*NL*
ransacked
to
justify
the
monster
,
and
stamped
with
a
human
*NL*
face
.
London
is
religion
's
opportunity
--
not
the
decorous
*NL*
religion
of
theologians
,
but
anthropomorphic
,
crude
.
Yes
,
*NL*
the
continuous
flow
would
be
tolerable
if
a
man
of
our
own
*NL*
sort
--
not
anyone
pompous
or
tearful
--
were
caring
for
us
up
*NL*
in
the
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Londoner
seldom
understands
his
city
until
it
sweeps
*NL*
him
,
too
,
away
from
his
moorings
,
and
Margaret
's
eyes
were
*NL*
not
opened
until
the
lease
of
Wickham
Place
expired
.
She
*NL*
had
always
known
that
it
must
expire
,
but
the
knowledge
only
*NL*
became
vivid
about
nine
months
before
the
event
.
Then
the
*NL*
house
was
suddenly
ringed
with
pathos
.
It
had
seen
so
much
*NL*
happiness
.
Why
had
it
to
be
swept
away
?
In
the
streets
of
*NL*
the
city
she
noted
for
the
first
time
the
architecture
of
*NL*
hurry
,
and
heard
the
language
of
hurry
on
the
mouths
of
its
*NL*
inhabitants
--
clipped
words
,
formless
sentences
,
potted
*NL*
expressions
of
approval
or
disgust
.
Month
by
month
things
*NL*
were
stepping
livelier
,
but
to
what
goal
?
The
population
*NL*
still
rose
,
but
what
was
the
quality
of
the
men
born
?
The
*NL*
particular
millionaire
who
owned
the
freehold
of
Wickham
*NL*
Place
,
and
desired
to
erect
Babylonian
flats
upon
it
--
what
*NL*
right
had
he
to
stir
so
large
a
portion
of
the
quivering
*NL*
jelly
?
He
was
not
a
fool
--
she
had
heard
him
expose
*NL*
Socialism
--
but
true
insight
began
just
where
his
*NL*
intelligence
ended
,
and
one
gathered
that
this
was
the
case
*NL*
with
most
millionaires
.
What
right
had
such
men
--
But
*NL*
Margaret
checked
herself
.
That
way
lies
madness
.
Thank
*NL*
goodness
she
,
too
,
had
some
money
,
and
could
purchase
a
new
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tibby
,
now
in
his
second
year
at
Oxford
,
was
down
for
*NL*
the
Easter
vacation
,
and
Margaret
took
the
opportunity
of
*NL*
having
a
serious
talk
with
him
.
Did
he
at
all
know
where
he
*NL*
wanted
to
live
?
Tibby
did
n't
know
that
he
did
know
.
Did
he
*NL*
at
all
know
what
he
wanted
to
do
?
He
was
equally
uncertain
,
*NL*
but
when
pressed
remarked
that
he
should
prefer
to
be
quite
*NL*
free
of
any
profession
.
Margaret
was
not
shocked
,
but
went
*NL*
on
sewing
for
a
few
minutes
before
she
replied
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
thinking
of
Mr.
Vyse
.
He
never
strikes
me
as
*NL*
particularly
happy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye-es
,
''
said
Tibby
,
and
then
held
his
mouth
open
in
a
*NL*
curious
quiver
,
as
if
he
,
too
,
had
thoughts
of
Mr.
Vyse
,
had
*NL*
seen
round
,
through
,
over
,
and
beyond
Mr.
Vyse
,
had
weighed
*NL*
Mr.
Vyse
,
grouped
him
,
and
finally
dismissed
him
as
having
*NL*
no
possible
bearing
on
the
subject
under
discussion
.
That
*NL*
bleat
of
Tibby
's
infuriated
Helen
.
But
Helen
was
now
down
*NL*
in
the
dining-room
preparing
a
speech
about
political
*NL*
economy
.
At
times
her
voice
could
be
heard
declaiming
*NL*
through
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
Mr.
Vyse
is
rather
a
wretched
,
weedy
man
,
do
n't
you
*NL*

Then
there
's
Guy
.
That
was
a
pitiful
business
.
*NL*
Besides

shifting
to
the
general
--

one

the
better
*NL*

regular
work

*NL*
*NL*
Groans
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
stick
to

she
continued
,
smiling
.
``
I
am
*NL*
not
saying
it

educate
you

it
is
what
I
really
think

I

that
in
the
last
century
men
have
developed
the
*NL*
desire
for
work
,
and
they
must
not
starve
it
.
It
's
a
new
*NL*
desire
.
It
goes
with
a
great
deal
that
's
bad
,
but
in
itself
*NL*
it
's
good
,
and
I
hope
that
for

*NL*
will
soon
become
as
shocking
as

was
a
*NL*
hundred
years
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
experience
of
this
profound
desire
to
which
*NL*
you
allude

enunciated
Tibby
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
we
'll
leave
the
subject
till

do

not

Take
your

Only
do

*NL*
over

how
they

*NL*
arranged
them

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
Guy

Mr.
Vyse
most

said
Tibby
faintly
,
and
*NL*
leant
so
far
back
in
his
chair
that
he
extended
in
a
*NL*
horizontal
line
from
knees
to
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And

she
shook
off
the
*NL*
pince-nez
to
which
she
had
recently
taken

said
his

feeling
that

to
score
this
point

``

more

n't
really
mind
.
The
*NL*
admirable
creature
is
n't
capable
of
tragedy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
husband
may
be
,
though
,
''
said
Margaret
,
moving
to
*NL*
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
not
likely
.
No
one
capable
of
tragedy
could
*NL*
have
married
Mrs.
Lanoline
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
she
pretty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
figure
may
have
been
good
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
flats
,
their
only
outlook
,
hung
like
an
ornate
*NL*
curtain
between
Margaret
and
the
welter
of
London
.
Her
*NL*
thoughts
turned
sadly
to
house-hunting
.
Wickham
Place
had
*NL*
been
so
safe
.
She
feared
,
fantastically
,
that
her
own
*NL*
little
flock
might
be
moving
into
turmoil
and
squalor
,
into
*NL*
nearer
contact
with
such
episodes
as
these
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tibby
and
I
have
again
been
wondering
where
we
'll
live
*NL*
next
September
,
''
she
said
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tibby
had
better
first
wonder
what
he
'll
do
,
''
retorted
*NL*
Helen
;
and
that
topic
was
resumed
,
but
with
acrimony
.
Then
*NL*
tea
came
,
and
after
tea
Helen
went
on
preparing
her
speech
,
*NL*
and
Margaret
prepared
one
,
too
,
for
they
were
going
out
to
a
*NL*
discussion
society
on
the
morrow
.
But
her
thoughts
were
*NL*
poisoned
.
Mrs.
Lanoline
had
risen
out
of
the
abyss
,
like
a
*NL*
faint
smell
,
a
goblin
football
,
telling
of
a
life
where
love
*NL*
and
hatred
had
both
decayed
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
14
*NL*
*NL*
The
mystery
,
like
so
many
mysteries
,
was
explained
.
Next
*NL*
day
,
just
as
they
were
dressed
to
go
out
to
dinner
,
a
Mr.
*NL*
Bast
called
.
He
was
a
clerk
in
the
employment
of
the
*NL*
Porphyrion
Fire
Insurance
Company
.
Thus
much
from
his
*NL*
card
.
He
had
come
``
about
the
lady
yesterday
.
''
Thus
much
*NL*
from
Annie
,
who
had
shown
him
into
the
dining-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cheers
,
children
!
''
cried
Helen
.
``
It
's
Mrs.
Lanoline
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tibby
was
interested
.
The
three
hurried
downstairs
,
to
*NL*
find
,
not
the
gay
dog
they
expected
,
but
a
young
man
,
*NL*
colourless
,
toneless
,
who
had
already
the
mournful
eyes
*NL*
above
a
drooping
moustache
that
are
so
common
in
London
,
and
*NL*
that
haunt
some
streets
of
the
city
like
accusing
*NL*
presences
.
One
guessed
him
as
the
third
generation
,
*NL*
grandson
to
the
shepherd
or
ploughboy
whom
civilization
had
*NL*
sucked
into
the
town
;
as
one
of
the
thousands
who
have
lost
*NL*
the
life
of
the
body
and
failed
to
reach
the
life
of
the
*NL*
spirit
.
Hints
of
robustness
survived
in
him
,
more
than
a
*NL*
hint
of
primitive
good
looks
,
and
Margaret
,
noting
the
spine
*NL*
that
might
have
been
straight
,
and
the
chest
that
might
have
*NL*
broadened
,
wondered
whether
it
paid
to
give
up
the
glory
of
*NL*
the
animal
for
a
tail
coat
and
a
couple
of
ideas
.
Culture
*NL*
had
worked
in
her
own
case
,
but
during
the
last
few
weeks
*NL*
she
had
doubted
whether
it
humanized
the
majority
,
so
wide
*NL*
and
so
widening
is
the
gulf
that
stretches
between
the
*NL*
natural
and
the
philosophic
man
,
so
many
the
good
chaps
who
*NL*
are
wrecked
in
trying
to
cross
it
.
She
knew
this
type
very
*NL*
well
--
the
vague
aspirations
,
the
mental
dishonesty
,
the
*NL*
familiarity
with
the
outsides
of
books
.
She
knew
the
very
*NL*
tones
in
which
he
would
address
her
.
She
was
only
*NL*
unprepared
for
an
example
of
her
own
visiting-card
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
n't
remember
giving
me
this
,
Miss
Schlegel
?
''
*NL*
said
he
,
uneasily
familiar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
ca
n't
say
I
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
was
how
it
happened
,
you
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
did
we
meet
,
Mr.
Bast
?
For
the
minute
I
do
n't
remember
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a
concert
at
the
Queen
's
Hall
.
I
think
you
will
*NL*
recollect
,
''
he
added
pretentiously
,
``
when
I
tell
you
that
it
*NL*
included
a
performance
of
the
Fifth
Symphony
of
Beethoven
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
hear
the
Fifth
practically
every
time
it
's
done
,
so
*NL*
I
'm
not
sure
--
do
you
remember
,
Helen
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
it
the
time
the
sandy
cat
walked
round
the
balustrade
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
thought
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
do
n't
remember
.
That
's
the
only
Beethoven
I
*NL*
ever
remember
specially
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
,
if
I
may
say
so
,
took
away
my
umbrella
,
*NL*
inadvertently
of
course
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Likely
enough
,
''
Helen
laughed
,
``
for
I
steal
umbrellas
*NL*
even
oftener
than
I
hear
Beethoven
.
Did
you
get
it
back
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
thank
you
,
Miss
Schlegel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
mistake
arose
out
of
my
card
,
did
it
?
''
interposed
Margaret
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
the
mistake
arose
--
it
was
a
mistake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
lady
who
called
here
yesterday
thought
that
you
*NL*
were
calling
too
,
and
that
she
could
find
you
?
''
she
*NL*
continued
,
pushing
him
forward
,
for
,
though
he
had
promised
*NL*
an
explanation
,
he
seemed
unable
to
give
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
so
,
calling
too
--
a
mistake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
--
?
''
began
Helen
,
but
Margaret
laid
a
hand
on
*NL*
her
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
said
to
my
wife
,
''
he
continued
more
rapidly
--
``
I
said
*NL*
to
Mrs.
Bast
,
'
I
have
to
pay
a
call
on
some
friends
,
'
and
*NL*
Mrs.
Bast
said
to
me
,
`
Do
go
.
'
While
I
was
gone
,
however
,
*NL*
she
wanted
me
on
important
business
,
and
thought
I
had
come
*NL*
here
,
owing
to
the
card
,
and
so
came
after
me
,
and
I
beg
to
*NL*
tender
my
apologies
,
and
hers
as
well
,
for
any
inconvenience
*NL*
we
may
have
inadvertently
caused
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
inconvenience
,
''
said
Helen
;
``
but
I
still
do
n't
understand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
An
air
of
evasion
characterized
Mr.
Bast
.
He
explained
*NL*
again
,
but
was
obviously
lying
,
and
Helen
did
n't
see
why
he
*NL*
should
get
off
.
She
had
the
cruelty
of
youth
.
Neglecting
*NL*
her
sister
's
pressure
,
she
said
,
``
I
still
do
n't
understand
.
*NL*
When
did
you
say
you
paid
this
call
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Call
?
What
call
?
''
said
he
,
staring
as
if
her
question
*NL*
had
been
a
foolish
one
,
a
favourite
device
of
those
in
mid-stream
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
afternoon
call
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
afternoon
,
of
course
!
''
he
replied
,
and
looked
at
*NL*
Tibby
to
see
how
the
repartee
went
.
But
Tibby
,
himself
a
*NL*
repartee
,
was
unsympathetic
,
and
said
,
``
Saturday
afternoon
*NL*
or
Sunday
afternoon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
S-Saturday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
!
''
said
Helen
;
``
and
you
were
still
calling
on
*NL*
Sunday
,
when
your
wife
came
here
.
A
long
visit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
call
that
fair

''
said
Mr.
Bast
,
going
scarlet
*NL*
and
handsome
.
There
was
fight
in
his
eyes
.
''
I
know
what
*NL*
you
mean
,
and
it
is
n't
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
n't
let
us
mind

said
Margaret
,
distressed
again
*NL*
by
odours
from
the
abyss
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
something
else
,
''
he
asserted
,
his
elaborate
*NL*
manner
breaking
down
.
``
I
was
somewhere
else
to
what
you
*NL*
think
,
so
there
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
good
of
you
to
come
and
explain
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
``
The
rest
is
naturally
no
concern
of
ours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
I
want
--
I
wanted
--
have
you
ever
read
THE
*NL*
ORDEAL
OF
RICHARD
FEVEREL

*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
nodded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
beautiful
book

wanted
to
get

Earth

Richard
does
in
the
end

Or
have
*NL*
you
ever
read
Stevenson
's
PRINCE
OTTO
?

*NL*
*NL*
Helen
and
Tibby
groaned
gently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
another
beautiful
book
.
You
get
back
to
the
*NL*
Earth
in
that

I
wanted

''
He
mouthed
affectedly
.
Then
*NL*
through
the
mists
of
his
culture
came
a
hard
fact
,
hard
as
a
*NL*
pebble
.
``
I
walked
all
the
Saturday
night
,
''
said
Leonard
.
*NL*
``
I
walked
.
''
A
thrill
of
approval
ran
through
the
sisters
.
*NL*
But
culture
closed
in
again
.
He
asked
whether
they
had
ever
*NL*
read
E.
V.
Lucas
's
OPEN
ROAD
.
*NL*
*NL*
Said
Helen
,
``
No
doubt
it
's
another
beautiful
book
,
but
*NL*
I
'd
rather
hear
about
your
road
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
walked
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
far
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
nor
for
how
long

It
got
too
dark
to
see
*NL*
my
watch

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Were
you
walking
alone
,
may
I
ask
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
said
,
straightening
himself
;
``
but
we
'd
been
*NL*
talking
it
over
at
the
office
.
There
's
been
a
lot
of
talk
*NL*
at
the
office
lately
about
these
things
.
The
fellows
there
*NL*
said
one
steers
by
the
Pole
Star
,
and
I
looked
it
up
in
the
*NL*
celestial
atlas
,
but
once
out
of
doors
everything
gets
so
mixed
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
talk
to
me
about
the
Pole
Star

interrupted
*NL*
Helen
,
who
was
becoming
interested
.
``
I
know
its
little
*NL*
ways

It
goes
round
and
round
,
and
you
go
round
after
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
lost
it
entirely
.
First
of
all
the
street
*NL*
lamps
,
then
the
trees
,
and
towards
morning
it
got
cloudy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tibby
,
who
preferred
his
comedy
undiluted
,
slipped
from
*NL*
the
room
.
He
knew
that
this
fellow
would
never
attain
to
*NL*
poetry
,
and
did
not
want
to
hear
him
trying
.
Margaret
and
*NL*
Helen
remained
.
Their
brother
influenced
them
more
than
*NL*
they
knew
:
in
his
absence
they
were
stirred
to
enthusiasm
*NL*
more
easily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
did
you
start
from
?
''
cried
Margaret
.
``
Do
tell
us
*NL*
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
took
the
Underground
to
Wimbledon

As
I
came
out
of

the
office
I
said
to
myself

I
must
have
a
walk
once
in

way

If
I
do
n't
take
this
walk
now

I
shall
never
take
it

*NL*
I
had
a
bit
of
dinner
at
Wimbledon
,

then
--

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
not
good
country
there

it

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
gas-lamps
for
hours

Still

I
had
all
the

night

being
out
was
the
great
thing

I
did
get
into
*NL*
woods
,
too

presently

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

on

Helen

no

Did
you
actually
go
off

*NL*
``
Oh
yes

I
always
meant

go
off

the

worst
of

more
difficult

``
Mr.
Bast

Margaret

``
No

have
attempted

end
in

broken
neck

Whatever
did

say

*NL*
*NL*
``
Professional

Helen

I
felt

VIRGINIBUS

``
Yes

the
wood

This
`

How
did
you
get

out
of
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
managed
one
wood

and
found
a
road
the
other
side
*NL*
which
went
a
good
bit
uphill

I
rather
fancy
it
was
those
*NL*
North
Downs
,
for
the
road
went
off
into
grass
,
and
I
got
*NL*
into
another
wood

That
was
awful
,
with
gorse
bushes

I
*NL*
did
wish
I
'd
never
come
,
but
suddenly
it
got
light
--
just
*NL*
while
I
seemed
going
under
one
tree
.
Then
I
found
a
road
*NL*
down
to
a
station
,
and
took
the
first
train
I
could
back
to
London
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
was
the
dawn
wonderful
?

asked
Helen
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
unforgettable
sincerity
he
replied
,
``
No
.
''
The
word
*NL*
flew
again
like
a
pebble
from
the
sling
.
Down
toppled
all
*NL*
that
had
seemed
ignoble
or
literary
in
his
talk
,
down
*NL*
toppled
tiresome
R.
L.
S.
and
the
``
love
of
the
earth
''
and
*NL*
his
silk
top-hat
.
In
the
presence
of
these
women
Leonard
*NL*
had
arrived
,
and
he
spoke
with
a
flow
,
an
exultation
,
that
*NL*
he
had
seldom
known
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
dawn

only
grey
,
it
was
nothing
to
mention
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
a
grey
evening
turned
upside
down
.
I
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
--
and
I
was
too
tired
to
lift
up
my
head
to
look
at
it
,
*NL*
and
so
cold
too
.
I
'm
glad
I
did
it
,
and
yet
at
the
time
it
*NL*
bored
me
more
than
I
can
say
.
And
besides
--
you
can
believe
*NL*
me
or
not
as
you
choose
--
I
was
very
hungry
.
That
dinner
at
*NL*
Wimbledon
--
I
meant
it
to
last
me
all
night
like
other
*NL*
dinners
.
I
never
thought
that
walking
would
make
such
a
*NL*
difference
.
Why
,
when
you
're
walking
you
want
,
as
it
were
,
*NL*
a
breakfast
and
luncheon
and
tea
during
the
night
as
well
,
*NL*
and
I
'd
nothing
but
a
packet
of
Woodbines
.
Lord
,
I
did
feel
*NL*
bad
!
Looking
back
,
it
was
n't
what
you
may
call
enjoyment
.
*NL*
It
was
more
a
case
of
sticking
to
it
.
I
did
stick
.
I
--
I
*NL*
was
determined
.
Oh
,
hang
it
all
!
what
's
the
good
--
I
mean
,
*NL*
the
good
of
living
in
a
room
for
ever
?
There
one
goes
on
*NL*
day
after
day
,
same
old
game
,
same
up
and
down
to
town
,
*NL*
until
you
forget
there
is
any
other
game
.
You
ought
to
see
*NL*
once
in
a
way
what
's
going
on
outside
,
if
it
's
only
nothing
*NL*
particular
after
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
just
think
you
ought
,
''
said
Helen
,
sitting
on
*NL*
the
edge
of
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sound
of
a
lady
's
voice
recalled
him
from
sincerity
,
*NL*
and
he
said
:
``
Curious
it
should
all
come
about
from
reading
*NL*
something
of
Richard
Jefferies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
Mr.
Bast
,
but
you
're
wrong
there
.
It
*NL*
did
n't
.
It
came
from
something
far
greater
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
could
not
stop
him
.
Borrow
was
imminent
after
*NL*
Jefferies
--
Borrow
,
Thoreau
,
and
sorrow
.
R.
L.
S.
brought
up
*NL*
the
rear
,
and
the
outburst
ended
in
a
swamp
of
books
.
No
*NL*
disrespect
to
these
great
names
.
The
fault
is
ours
,
not
*NL*
theirs
.
They
mean
us
to
use
them
for
sign-posts
,
and
are
*NL*
not
to
blame
if
,
in
our
weakness
,
we
mistake
the
sign-post
*NL*
for
the
destination
.
And
Leonard
had
reached
the
*NL*
destination
.
He
had
visited
the
county
of
Surrey
when
*NL*
darkness
covered
its
amenities
,
and
its
cosy
villas
had
*NL*
re-entered
ancient
night
.
Every
twelve
hours
this
miracle
*NL*
happens
,
but
he
had
troubled
to
go
and
see
for
himself
.
*NL*
Within
his
cramped
little
mind
dwelt
something
that
was
*NL*
greater
than
Jefferies
'
books
--
the
spirit
that
led
Jefferies
*NL*
to
write
them
;
and
his
dawn
,
though
revealing
nothing
but
*NL*
monotones
,
was
part
of
the
eternal
sunrise
that
shows
George
*NL*
Borrow
Stonehenge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
do
n't
think
I
was
foolish
?
''
he
asked
,
becoming
*NL*
again
the
naive
and
sweet-tempered
boy
for
whom
Nature
had
*NL*
intended
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heavens
,
no
!
''
replied
Margaret
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heaven
help
us
if
we
do
!
''
replied
Helen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
very
glad
you
say
that
.
Now
,
my
wife
would
never
*NL*
understand
--
not
if
I
explained
for
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
was
n't
foolish
!
''
cried
Helen
,
her
eyes
aflame
.
*NL*
``
You
've
pushed
back
the
boundaries
;
I
think
it
splendid
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
not
been
content
to
dream
as
we
have
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Though
we
have
walked
,
too
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
show
you
a
picture
upstairs
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
door-bell
rang
.
The
hansom
had
come
to
take
*NL*
them
to
their
evening
party
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
bother
,
not
to
say
dash
--
I
had
forgotten
we
were
*NL*
dining
out
;
but
do
,
do
,
come
round
again
and
have
a
talk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
must
--
do
,
''
echoed
Margaret
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leonard
,
with
extreme
sentiment
,
replied
:
``
No
,
I
shall
*NL*
not
.
It
's
better
like
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
better
?
''
asked
Margaret
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
is
better
not
to
risk
a
second
interview
.
I
*NL*
shall
always
look
back
on
this
talk
with
you
as
one
of
the
*NL*
finest
things
in
my
life
.
Really
.
I
mean
this
.
We
can
*NL*
never
repeat
.
It
has
done
me
real
good
,
and
there
we
had
*NL*
better
leave
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
rather
a
sad
view
of
life
,
surely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Things
so
often
get
spoiled
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
,
''
flashed
Helen
,
``
but
people
do
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
understand
this
.
He
continued
in
a
vein
*NL*
which
mingled
true
imagination
and
false
.
What
he
said
*NL*
was
n't
wrong
,
but
it
was
n't
right
,
and
a
false
note
jarred
.
*NL*
One
little
twist
,
they
felt
,
and
the
instrument
might
be
in
*NL*
tune
.
One
little
strain
,
and
it
might
be
silent
for
ever
.
*NL*
He
thanked
the
ladies
very
much
,
but
he
would
not
call
*NL*
again
.
There
was
a
moment
's
awkwardness
,
and
then
Helen
*NL*
said
:
``
Go
,
then
;
perhaps
you
know
best
;
but
never
forget
*NL*
you
're
better
than
Jefferies
.
''
And
he
went
.
Their
hansom
*NL*
caught
him
up
at
the
corner
,
passed
with
a
waving
of
hands
,
*NL*
and
vanished
with
its
accomplished
load
into
the
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
London
was
beginning
to
illuminate
herself
against
the
*NL*
night
.
Electric
lights
sizzled
and
jagged
in
the
main
*NL*
thoroughfares
,
gas-lamps
in
the
side
streets
glimmered
a
*NL*
canary
gold
or
green
.
The
sky
was
a
crimson
battlefield
of
*NL*
spring
,
but
London
was
not
afraid
.
Her
smoke
mitigated
the
*NL*
splendour
,
and
the
clouds
down
Oxford
Street
were
a
*NL*
delicately
painted
ceiling
,
which
adorned
while
it
did
not
*NL*
distract
.
She
has
never
known
the
clear-cut
armies
of
the
*NL*
purer
air
.
Leonard
hurried
through
her
tinted
wonders
,
very
*NL*
much
part
of
the
picture
.
His
was
a
grey
life
,
and
to
*NL*
brighten
it
he
had
ruled
off
a
few
corners
for
romance
.
The
*NL*
Miss
Schlegels
--
or
,
to
speak
more
accurately
,
his
interview
*NL*
with
them
--
were
to
fill
such
a
corner
,
nor
was
it
by
any
*NL*
means
the
first
time
that
he
had
talked
intimately
to
*NL*
strangers
.
The
habit
was
analogous
to
a
debauch
,
an
outlet
,
*NL*
though
the
worst
of
outlets
,
for
instincts
that
would
not
be
*NL*
denied
.
Terrifying
him
,
it
would
beat
down
his
suspicions
*NL*
and
prudence
until
he
was
confiding
secrets
to
people
whom
*NL*
he
had
scarcely
seen
.
It
brought
him
many
fears
and
some
*NL*
pleasant
memories
.
Perhaps
the
keenest
happiness
he
had
*NL*
ever
known
was
during
a
railway
journey
to
Cambridge
,
where
*NL*
a
decent-mannered
undergraduate
had
spoken
to
him
.
They
had
*NL*
got
into
conversation
,
and
gradually
Leonard
flung
reticence
*NL*
aside
,
told
some
of
his
domestic
troubles
,
and
hinted
at
the
*NL*
rest
.
The
undergraduate
,
supposing
they
could
start
a
*NL*
friendship
,
asked
him
to
``
coffee
after
hall
,
''
which
he
*NL*
accepted
,
but
afterwards
grew
shy
,
and
took
care
not
to
stir
*NL*
from
the
commercial
hotel
where
he
lodged
.
He
did
not
want
*NL*
Romance
to
collide
with
the
Porphyrion
,
still
less
with
*NL*
Jacky
,
and
people
with
fuller
,
happier
lives
are
slow
to
*NL*
understand
this
.
To
the
Schlegels
,
as
to
the
undergraduate
,
*NL*
he
was
an
interesting
creature
,
of
whom
they
wanted
to
see
*NL*
more
.
But
they
to
him
were
denizens
of
Romance
,
who
must
*NL*
keep
to
the
corner
he
had
assigned
them
,
pictures
that
must
*NL*
not
walk
out
of
their
frames
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
behaviour
over
Margaret
's
visiting-card
had
been
*NL*
typical
.
His
had
scarcely
been
a
tragic
marriage
.
Where
*NL*
there
is
no
money
and
no
inclination
to
violence
tragedy
*NL*
can
not
be
generated
.
He
could
not
leave
his
wife
,
and
he
*NL*
did
not
want
to
hit
her
.
Petulance
and
squalor
were
*NL*
enough
.
Here
``
that
card
''
had
come
in
.
Leonard
,
though
*NL*
furtive
,
was
untidy
,
and
left
it
lying
about
.
Jacky
found
*NL*
it
,
and
then
began
,
``
What
's
that
card
,
eh
?
''
``
Yes
,
do
n't
you
*NL*
wish
you
knew
what
that
card
was
?
''
``
Len
,
who
's
Miss
*NL*
Schlegel
?
''
etc.
.
Months
passed
,
and
the
card
,
now
as
a
joke
,
*NL*
now
as
a
grievance
,
was
handed
about
,
getting
dirtier
and
*NL*
dirtier
.
It
followed
them
when
they
moved
from
Cornelia
*NL*
Road
to
Tulse
Hill
.
It
was
submitted
to
third
parties
.
A
*NL*
few
inches
of
pasteboard
,
it
became
the
battlefield
on
which
*NL*
the
souls
of
Leonard
and
his
wife
contended
.
Why
did
he
not
*NL*
say
,
``
A
lady
took
my
umbrella
,
another
gave
me
this
that
I
*NL*
might
call
for
my
umbrella
''
?
Because
Jacky
would
have
*NL*
disbelieved
him
?
Partly
,
but
chiefly
because
he
was
*NL*
sentimental
.
No
affection
gathered
round
the
card
,
but
it
*NL*
symbolized
the
life
of
culture
,
that
Jacky
should
never
*NL*
spoil
.
At
night
he
would
say
to
himself
,
``
Well
,
at
all
*NL*
events
,
she
does
n't
know
about
that
card
.
Yah
!
done
her
there
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Jacky
!
she
was
not
a
bad
sort
,
and
had
a
great
*NL*
deal
to
bear
.
She
drew
her
own
conclusion
--
she
was
only
*NL*
capable
of
drawing
one
conclusion
--
and
in
the
fulness
of
*NL*
time
she
acted
upon
it
.
All
the
Friday
Leonard
had
refused
*NL*
to
speak
to
her
,
and
had
spent
the
evening
observing
the
*NL*
stars
.
On
the
Saturday
he
went
up
,
as
usual
,
to
town
,
but
*NL*
he
came
not
back
Saturday
night
nor
Sunday
morning
,
nor
*NL*
Sunday
afternoon
.
The
inconvenience
grew
intolerable
,
and
*NL*
though
she
was
now
of
a
retiring
habit
,
and
shy
of
women
,
*NL*
she
went
up
to
Wickham
Place
.
Leonard
returned
in
her
*NL*
absence
.
The
card
,
the
fatal
card
,
was
gone
from
the
pages
*NL*
of
Ruskin
,
and
he
guessed
what
had
happened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
he
had
exclaimed
,
greeting
her
with
peals
of
*NL*
laughter
.
``
I
know
where
you
've
been
,
but
you
do
n't
know
*NL*
where
I
've
been
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jacky
sighed
,
said
,
``
Len
,
I
do
think
you
might
explain
,
''
*NL*
and
resumed
domesticity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Explanations
were
difficult
at
this
stage
,
and
Leonard
*NL*
was
too
silly
--
or
it
is
tempting
to
write
,
too
sound
a
chap
*NL*
to
attempt
them
.
His
reticence
was
not
entirely
the
shoddy
*NL*
article
that
a
business
life
promotes
,
the
reticence
that
*NL*
pretends
that
nothing
is
something
,
and
hides
behind
the
*NL*
DAILY
TELEGRAPH
.
The
adventurer
,
also
,
is
reticent
,
and
it
*NL*
is
an
adventure
for
a
clerk
to
walk
for
a
few
hours
in
*NL*
darkness
.
You
may
laugh
at
him
,
you
who
have
slept
nights
*NL*
on
the
veldt
,
with
your
rifle
beside
you
and
all
the
*NL*
atmosphere
of
adventure
past
.
And
you
also
may
laugh
who
*NL*
think
adventures
silly
.
But
do
not
be
surprised
if
Leonard
*NL*
is
shy
whenever
he
meets
you
,
and
if
the
Schlegels
rather
*NL*
than
Jacky
hear
about
the
dawn
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
the
Schlegels
had
not
thought
him
foolish
became
a
*NL*
permanent
joy
.
He
was
at
his
best
when
he
thought
of
them
.
*NL*
It
buoyed
him
as
he
journeyed
home
beneath
fading
heavens
.
*NL*
Somehow
the
barriers
of
wealth
had
fallen
,
and
there
had
*NL*
been
--
he
could
not
phrase
it
--
a
general
assertion
of
the
*NL*
wonder
of
the
world
.
``
My
conviction
,
''
says
the
mystic
,
*NL*
``
gains
infinitely
the
moment
another
soul
will
believe
in
*NL*
it
,
''
and
they
had
agreed
that
there
was
something
beyond
*NL*
life
's
daily
grey
.
He
took
off
his
top-hat
and
smoothed
it
*NL*
thoughtfully
.
He
had
hitherto
supposed
the
unknown
to
be
*NL*
books
,
literature
,
clever
conversation
,
culture
.
One
raised
*NL*
oneself
by
study
,
and
got
upsides
with
the
world
.
But
in
*NL*
that
quick
interchange
a
new
light
dawned
.
Was
that
*NL*
something
''
walking
in
the
dark
among
the
surburban
hills
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
discovered
that
he
was
going
bareheaded
down
Regent
*NL*
Street
.
London
came
back
with
a
rush
.
Few
were
about
at
*NL*
this
hour
,
but
all
whom
he
passed
looked
at
him
with
a
*NL*
hostility
that
was
the
more
impressive
because
it
was
*NL*
unconscious
.
He
put
his
hat
on
.
It
was
too
big
;
his
head
*NL*
disappeared
like
a
pudding
into
a
basin
,
the
ears
bending
*NL*
outwards
at
the
touch
of
the
curly
brim
.
He
wore
it
a
*NL*
little
backwards
,
and
its
effect
was
greatly
to
elongate
the
*NL*
face
and
to
bring
out
the
distance
between
the
eyes
and
the
*NL*
moustache
.
Thus
equipped
,
he
escaped
criticism
.
No
one
*NL*
felt
uneasy
as
he
titupped
along
the
pavements
,
the
heart
of
*NL*
a
man
ticking
fast
in
his
chest
.

The
sisters
went
out
to
dinner
full
of
their
adventure
,
and
*NL*
when
they
were
both
full
of
the
same
subject
,
there
were
few
*NL*
dinner-parties
that
could
stand
up
against
them
.
This
*NL*
particular
one
,
which
was
all
ladies
,
had
more
kick
in
it
*NL*
than
most
,
but
succumbed
after
a
struggle
.
Helen
at
one
*NL*
part
of
the
table
,
Margaret
at
the
other
,
would
talk
of
Mr.
*NL*
Bast
and
of
no
one
else
,
and
somewhere
about
the
entree
*NL*
their
monologues
collided
,
fell
ruining
,
and
became
common
*NL*
property
.
Nor
was
this
all
.
The
dinner-party
was
really
an
*NL*
informal
discussion
club
;
there
was
a
paper
after
it
,
read
*NL*
amid
coffee-cups
and
laughter
in
the
drawing-room
,
but
*NL*
dealing
more
or
less
thoughtfully
with
some
topic
of
general
*NL*
interest
.
After
the
paper
came
a
debate
,
and
in
this
debate
*NL*
Mr.
Bast
also
figured
,
appearing
now
as
a
bright
spot
in
*NL*
civilization
,
now
as
a
dark
spot
,
according
to
the
*NL*
temperament
of
the
speaker
.
The
subject
of
the
paper
had
*NL*
been
,
``
How
ought
I
to
dispose
of
my
money
?
''
the
reader
*NL*
professing
to
be
a
millionaire
on
the
point
of
death
,
*NL*
inclined
to
bequeath
her
fortune
for
the
foundation
of
local
*NL*
art
galleries
,
but
open
to
conviction
from
other
sources
.
*NL*
The
various
parts
had
been
assigned
beforehand
,
and
some
of
*NL*
the
speeches
were
amusing
.
The
hostess
assumed
the
*NL*
ungrateful
role
of
``
the
millionaire
's
eldest
son
,
''
and
*NL*
implored
her
expiring
parent
not
to
dislocate
Society
by
*NL*
allowing
such
vast
sums
to
pass
out
of
the
family
.
Money
*NL*
was
the
fruit
of
self-denial
,
and
the
second
generation
had
*NL*
a
right
to
profit
by
the
self-denial
of
the
first
.
What
*NL*
right
had
``
Mr.
Bast
''
to
profit
?
The
National
Gallery
was
*NL*
good
enough
for
the
likes
of
him
.
After
property
had
had
*NL*
its
say
--
a
saying
that
is
necessarily
ungracious
--
the
*NL*
various
philanthropists
stepped
forward
.
Something
must
be
*NL*
done
for
``
Mr.
Bast
''
:
his
conditions
must
be
improved
without
*NL*
impairing
his
independence
;
he
must
have
a
free
library
,
or
*NL*
free
tennis-courts
;
his
rent
must
be
paid
in
such
a
way
that
*NL*
he
did
not
know
it
was
being
paid
;
it
must
be
made
worth
his
*NL*
while
to
join
the
Territorials
;
he
must
be
forcibly
parted
*NL*
from
his
uninspiring
wife
,
the
money
going
to
her
as
*NL*
compensation
;
he
must
be
assigned
a
Twin
Star
,
some
member
*NL*
of
the
leisured
classes
who
would
watch
over
him
ceaselessly
*NL*
-LRB-
groans
from
Helen
-RRB-
;
he
must
be
given
food
but
no
clothes
,
*NL*
clothes
but
no
food
,
a
third-return
ticket
to
Venice
,
*NL*
without
either
food
or
clothes
when
he
arrived
there
.
In
*NL*
short
,
he
might
be
given
anything
and
everything
so
long
as
*NL*
it
was
not
the
money
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
here
Margaret
interrupted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Order
,
order
,
Miss
Schlegel
!
''
said
the
reader
of
the
*NL*
paper
.
``
You
are
here
,
I
understand
,
to
advise
me
in
the
*NL*
interests
of

Places
of
*NL*
Historic
Interest
or
Natural
Beauty
.
I
can
not
have
you
*NL*
speaking
out
of
your
role
.
It
makes
my
poor
head
go
round
,
*NL*
and
I
think
you
forget
that
I
am
very
ill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
head
wo
n't
go
round
if
only
you
'll
listen
to
my
*NL*
argument

''
said
Margaret
.
``
Why
not
give
him
the
money
*NL*
itself

You
're
supposed
to
have
about
thirty
thousand
a
year

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
I
?
I
thought
I
had
a
million

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
n't
a
million
your
capital
?
Dear
me
!
we
ought
to
*NL*
have
settled
that
.
Still
,
it
does
n't
matter
.
Whatever
*NL*
you
've
got
,
I
order
you
to
give
as
many
poor
men
as
you
can
*NL*
three
hundred
a
year
each
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
that
would
be
pauperizing
them
,
''
said
an
earnest
*NL*
girl
,
who
liked
the
Schlegels
,
but
thought
them
a
little
*NL*
unspiritual
at
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
if
you
gave
them
so
much
.
A
big
windfall
would
not
*NL*
pauperize
a
man
.
It
is
these
little
driblets
,
distributed
*NL*
among
too
many
,
that
do
the
harm
.
Money
's
educational
.
*NL*
It
's
far
more
educational
than
the
things
it
buys
.
''
There
*NL*
was
a
protest
.
``
In
a
sense
,
''
added
Margaret
,
but
the
*NL*
protest
continued
.
``
Well
,
is
n't
the
most
civilized
thing
*NL*
going
,
the
man
who
has
learnt
to
wear
his
income
properly
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
what
your
Mr.
Basts
wo
n't
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
them
a
chance
.
Give
them
money
.
Do
n't
dole
them
*NL*
out
poetry-books
and
railway-tickets
like
babies
.
Give
them
*NL*
the
wherewithal
to
buy
these
things
.
When
your
Socialism
*NL*
comes
it
may
be
different
,
and
we
may
think
in
terms
of
*NL*
commodities
instead
of
cash
.
Till
it
comes
give
people
*NL*
cash
,
for
it
is
the
warp
of
civilization
,
whatever
the
woof
*NL*
may
be
.
The
imagination
ought
to
play
upon
money
and
*NL*
realize
it
vividly
,
for
it
's
the
--
the
second
most
important
*NL*
thing
in
the
world
.
It
is
so
sluffed
over
and
hushed
up
,
*NL*
there
is
so
little
clear
thinking
--
oh
,
political
economy
,
of
*NL*
course
,

so
few
of
us
think
clearly
about
our
own
private

incomes
,
and
admit
that
independent
thoughts
are
in
nine
*NL*
cases
out
of
ten
the
result
of
independent
means
.
Money
:
*NL*
give
Mr.
Bast
money
,
and
do
n't
bother
about
his
ideals
.
*NL*
He
'll
pick
up
those
for
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
leant
back
while
the
more
earnest
members
of
the
*NL*
club
began
to
misconstrue
her
.
The
female
mind
,
though
*NL*
cruelly
practical
in
daily
life
,
can
not
bear
to
hear
ideals
*NL*
belittled
in
conversation
,
and
Miss
Schlegel
was
asked
*NL*
however
she
could
say
such
dreadful
things
,
and
what
it
*NL*
would
profit
Mr.
Bast
if
he
gained
the
whole
world
and
lost
*NL*
his
own
soul
.
She
answered
,
``
Nothing
,
but
he
would
not
gain
*NL*
his
soul
until
he
had
gained
a
little
of
the
world
.
''
Then
*NL*
they
said
,
``
No
they
did
not
believe
it
,
''
and
she
admitted
*NL*
that
an
overworked
clerk
may
save
his
soul
in
the
*NL*
superterrestrial
sense
,
where
the
effort
will
be
taken
for
*NL*
the
deed
,
but
she
denied
that
he
will
ever
explore
the
*NL*
spiritual
resources
of
this
world
,
will
ever
know
the
rarer
*NL*
joys
of
the
body
,
or
attain
to
clear
and
passionate
*NL*
intercourse
with
his
fellows
.
Others
had
attacked
the
*NL*
fabric
of
Society-Property
,
Interest
,
etc.
;
she
only
fixed
*NL*
her
eyes
on
a
few
human
beings
,
to
see
how
,
under
present
*NL*
conditions
,
they
could
be
made
happier
.
Doing
good
to
*NL*
humanity
was
useless
:
the
many-coloured
efforts
thereto
*NL*
spreading
over
the
vast
area
like
films
and
resulting
in
an
*NL*
universal
grey
.
To
do
good
to
one
,
or
,
as
in
this
case
,
to
*NL*
a
few
,
was
the
utmost
she
dare
hope
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
Between
the
idealists
,
and
the
political
economists
,
*NL*
Margaret
had
a
bad
time
.
Disagreeing
elsewhere
,
they
agreed
*NL*
in
disowning
her
,
and
in
keeping
the
administration
of
the
*NL*
millionaire
's
money
in
their
own
hands
.
The
earnest
girl
*NL*
brought
forward
a
scheme
of
``
personal
supervision
and
mutual
*NL*
help
,
''
the
effect
of
which
was
to
alter
poor
people
until
*NL*
they
became
exactly
like
people
who
were
not
so
poor
.
The
*NL*
hostess
pertinently
remarked
that
she
,
as
eldest
son
,
might
*NL*
surely
rank
among
the
millionaire
's
legatees
.
Margaret
*NL*
weakly
admitted
the
claim
,
and
another
claim
was
at
once
set
*NL*
up
by
Helen
,
who
declared
that
she
had
been
the
*NL*
millionaire
's
housemaid
for
over
forty
years
,
overfed
and
*NL*
underpaid
;
was
nothing
to
be
done
for
her
,
so
corpulent
and
*NL*
poor
?
The
millionaire
then
read
out
her
last
will
and
*NL*
testament
,
in
which
she
left
the
whole
of
her
fortune
to
the
*NL*
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
.
Then
she
died
.
The
serious
*NL*
parts
of
the
discussion
had
been
of
higher
merit
than
the
*NL*
playful
--
in
a
men
's
debate
is
the
reverse
more
*NL*
general
?
--
but
the
meeting
broke
up
hilariously
enough
,
and
*NL*
a
dozen
happy
ladies
dispersed
to
their
homes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Helen
and
Margaret
walked
the
earnest
girl
as
far
as
*NL*
Battersea
Bridge
Station
,
arguing
copiously
all
the
way
.
*NL*
When
she
had
gone
they
were
conscious
of
an
alleviation
,
and
*NL*
of
the
great
beauty
of
the
evening
.
They
turned
back
*NL*
towards
Oakley
Street
.
The
lamps
and
the
plane-trees
,
*NL*
following
the
line
of
the
embankment
,
struck
a
note
of
*NL*
dignity
that
is
rare
in
English
cities
.
The
seats
,
almost
*NL*
deserted
,
were
here
and
there
occupied
by
gentlefolk
in
*NL*
evening
dress
,
who
had
strolled
out
from
the
houses
behind
*NL*
to
enjoy
fresh
air
and
the
whisper
of
the
rising
tide
.
*NL*
There
is
something
continental
about
Chelsea
Embankment
.
It
*NL*
is
an
open
space
used
rightly
,
a
blessing
more
frequent
in
*NL*
Germany
than
here
.
As
Margaret
and
Helen
sat
down
,
the
city
*NL*
behind
them
seemed
to
be
a
vast
theatre
,
an
opera-house
in
*NL*
which
some
endless
trilogy
was
performing
,
and
they
*NL*
themselves
a
pair
of
satisfied
subscribers
,
who
did
not
mind
*NL*
losing
a
little
of
the
second
act
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cold
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tired

''
*NL*
*NL*
``

n't

*NL*
*NL*
The
earnest
girl
's
train
rumbled
away
over
the
bridge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say

Helen

*NL*

``

that
home

got

well
enough

a
spirit
of
excitement

*NL*
One
's
own
name
will
carry
immense
distances

Mr.

Wilcox
,
who
was
sitting
with
friends
many
seats
away
,
heard
*NL*
his
,
rose
to
his

strolled
along
towards
the
speakers

``

continued
Margaret

*NL*
``
Why

*NL*
Here
Mr.

reached
them
.
It
was
several
weeks

since
they
had
met

*NL*
*NL*
``
How

His
tones
were
protective

He
implied
that
one
ought

not
to
sit
out
on
Chelsea
Embankment
without
a
male
escort

*NL*
Helen
resented

Wilcox
,
extinguishing
his
cigarette
,
*NL*
and
sitting
down
between
them
.
``
Oh
,
Paul
's
all
right
.
We
*NL*
had
a
line
from
Madeira
.
He
'll
be
at
work
again
by
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ugh
--
''
said
Helen
,
shuddering
from
complex
causes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
the
climate
of
Nigeria
too
horrible
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Someone
's
got
to
go
,
''
he
said
simply
.
``
England
will
*NL*
never
keep
her
trade
overseas
unless
she
is
prepared
to
make
*NL*
sacrifices
.
Unless
we
get
firm
in
West
Africa
,
Ger
--
untold
*NL*
complications
may
follow
.
Now
tell
me
all
your
news
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
we
've
had
a
splendid
evening
,
''
cried
Helen
,
who
*NL*
always
woke
up
at
the
advent
of
a
visitor
.
``
We
belong
to
a
*NL*
kind
of
club
that
reads
papers
,
Margaret
and
I
--
all
women
,
*NL*
but
there
is
a
discussion
after
.
This
evening
it
was
on
how
*NL*
one
ought
to
leave
one
's
money
--
whether
to
one
's
family
,
or
*NL*
to
the
poor
,
and
if
so
how
--
oh
,
most
interesting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
of
business
smiled
.
Since
his
wife
's
death
he
*NL*
had
almost
doubled
his
income
.
He
was
an
important
figure
*NL*
at
last
,
a
reassuring
name
on
company
prospectuses
,
and
life
*NL*
had
treated
him
very
well
.
The
world
seemed
in
his
grasp
as
*NL*
he
listened
to
the
River
Thames
,
which
still
flowed
inland
*NL*
from
the
sea
.
So
wonderful
to
the
girls
,
it
held
no
*NL*
mysteries
for
him
.
He
had
helped
to
shorten
its
long
tidal
*NL*
trough
by
taking
shares
in
the
lock
at
Teddington
,
and
if
he
*NL*
and
other
capitalists
thought
good
,
some
day
it
could
be
*NL*
shortened
again
.
With
a
good
dinner
inside
him
and
an
*NL*
amiable
but
academic
woman
on
either
flank
,
he
felt
that
his
*NL*
hands
were
on
all
the
ropes
of
life
,
and
that
what
he
did
*NL*
not
know
could
not
be
worth
knowing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sounds
a
most
original
entertainment
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
*NL*
and
laughed
in
his
pleasant
way
.
``
I
wish
Evie
would
go
to
*NL*
that
sort
of
thing
.
But
she
has
n't
the
time
.
She
's
taken
*NL*
to
breed
Aberdeen
terriers
--
jolly
little
dogs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
expect
we
'd
better
be
doing
the
same
,
really
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
pretend
we
're
improving
ourselves
,
you
see
,
''
said
*NL*
Helen
a
little
sharply
,
for
the
Wilcox
glamour
is
not
of
the
*NL*
kind
that
returns
,
and
she
had
bitter
memories
of
the
days
*NL*
when
a
speech
such
as
he
had
just
made
would
have
impressed
*NL*
her
favourably
.
``
We
suppose
it
is
a
good
thing
to
waste
an
*NL*
evening
once
a
fortnight
over
a
debate
,
but
,
as
my
sister
*NL*
says
,
it
may
be
better
to
breed
dogs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
.
I
do
n't
agree
with
your
sister
.
There
's
*NL*
nothing
like
a
debate
to
teach
one
quickness
.
I
often
wish
*NL*
I
had
gone
in
for
them
when
I
was
a
youngster
.
It
would
*NL*
have
helped
me
no
end
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quickness
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
Quickness
in
argument
.
Time
after
time
I
've
*NL*
missed
scoring
a
point
because
the
other
man
has
had
the
*NL*
gift
of
the
gab
and
I
have
n't
.
Oh
,
I
believe
in
these
discussions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
patronizing
tone
thought
Margaret
,
came
well
enough
*NL*
from
a
man
who
was
old
enough
to
be
their
father
.
She
had
*NL*
always
maintained
that
Mr.
Wilcox
had
a
charm
.
In
times
of
*NL*
sorrow
or
emotion
his
inadequacy
had
pained
her
,
but
it
was
*NL*
pleasant
to
listen
to
him
now
,
and
to
watch
his
thick
brown
*NL*
moustache
and
high
forehead
confronting
the
stars
.
But
*NL*
Helen
was
nettled
.
The
aim
of
THEIR
debates
she
implied
was
*NL*
Truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
it
does
n't
much
matter
what
subject
you
take
,
''
*NL*
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
laughed
and
said
,
``
But
this
is
going
to
be
far
*NL*
better
than
the
debate
itself
.
''
Helen
recovered
herself
and
*NL*
laughed
too
.
``
No
,
I
wo
n't
go
on
,
''
she
declared
.
``
I
'll
just
*NL*
put
our
special
case
to
Mr.
Wilcox
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
Mr.
Bast
?
Yes

He
'll
be
more
lenient

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Mr.
Wilcox
,
do
first
light
another
cigarette
.
*NL*
It
's
this
.
We
've
just
come
across
a
young
fellow
,
who
's
*NL*
evidently
very
poor
,
and
who
seems
interest

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
his
profession

''
*NL*

``

``
What
in
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
remember

Margaret
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Porphyrion
Fire
Insurance
Company
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
;
the
nice
people
who
gave
Aunt
Juley
a
new
*NL*
hearth-rug
.
He
seems
interesting
,
in
some
ways
very
,
and
*NL*
one
wishes
one
could
help
him
.
He
is
married
to
a
wife
whom
*NL*
he
does
n't
seem
to
care
for
much
.
He
likes
books
,
and
what
*NL*
one
may
roughly
call
adventure
,
and
if
he
had
a
chance
--
But
*NL*
he
is
so
poor
.
He
lives
a
life
where
all
the
money
is
apt
*NL*
to
go
on
nonsense
and
clothes
.
One
is
so
afraid
that
*NL*
circumstances
will
be
too
strong
for
him
and
that
he
will
*NL*
sink
.
Well
,
he
got
mixed
up
in
our
debate
.
He
was
n't
the
*NL*
subject
of
it
,
but
it
seemed
to
bear
on
his
point
.
Suppose
*NL*
a
millionaire
died
,
and
desired
to
leave
money
to
help
such
*NL*
a
man
.
How
should
he
be
helped
?
Should
he
be
given
three
*NL*
hundred
pounds
a
year
direct
,
which
was
Margaret
's
plan
?
*NL*
Most
of
them
thought
this
would
pauperize
him
.
Should
he
*NL*
and
those
like
him
be
given
free
libraries
?
I
said
`
No
!
'
He
*NL*
does
n't
want
more
books
to
read
,
but
to
read
books
rightly
.
*NL*
My
suggestion
was
he
should
be
given
something
every
year
*NL*
towards
a
summer
holiday
,
but
then
there
is
his
wife
,
and
*NL*
they
said
she
would
have
to
go
too
.
Nothing
seemed
quite
*NL*
right
!
Now
what
do
you
think
?
Imagine
that
you
were
a
*NL*
millionaire
,
and
wanted
to
help
the
poor
.
What
would
you
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Wilcox
,
whose
fortune
was
not
so
very
far
below
the
*NL*
standard
indicated
,
laughed
exuberantly
.
``
My
dear
Miss
*NL*
Schlegel
,
I
will
not
rush
in
where
your
sex
has
been
unable

to
tread

I
will
not
add
another
plan
to
the
numerous
*NL*
excellent
ones
that
have
been
already
suggested
.
My
only
*NL*
contribution
is
this
:
let
your
young
friend
clear
out
of
the
*NL*
Porphyrion
Fire
Insurance
Company
with
all
possible
speed

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?

said
Margaret
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
lowered
his
voice
.
``
This
is
between
friends

It
'll
*NL*
be
in
the
Receiver

hands
before
Christmas

*NL*
he
added
,
thinking
that
she
had
not
understood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear

``

``
Why
's
that

*NL*
*NL*
Again
the
Olympian
laugh

the
lowered
voice

*NL*
``
Naturally

stronger
position

the

It
looks
as

he
's
worth
something

'm
afraid

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
n't
thought
of
that
,

murmured
Margaret
,
while
*NL*
Helen
said
,
``
Our
human
nature
appears
to
be
the
other
way

round

We
employ
people

The

boot
man

for
instance

*NL*
``
And
how
does
he
clean
the
boots

Not

``
There
you

interrupted
,
glancing
up

down

the
Embankment
,
in
case
his
indiscretion
had
been
*NL*
overheard
.
``
I
ought
n't
to
have
spoken

know

more

bad

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought

company
never

Helen

contribution

``
Do
n't
the
others
always
run
in

save
them

``
You

Mr.

mildly

there

hit
by

Human
nature

quoted
Helen
,
and
he

laughed

agreed
that
it
was

When
Margaret
said
that
she

supposed
that
clerks

like
every
one
else
,
found
it
*NL*
extremely
difficult
to
get
situations
in
these
days

he
*NL*
replied
,
``
Yes
,
extremely
,

and
rose
to
rejoin
his
friends

*NL*
He
knew
by
his
own
office

seldom
a
vacant
post
,

hundreds
of
applicants
for
it
;
at
present
no
vacant
post

*NL*
``
And
how
's
Howards
End
looking
?
''
said
Margaret
,
wishing
*NL*
to
change
the
subject
before
they
parted
.
Mr.
Wilcox
was
a
*NL*
little
apt
to
think
one
wanted
to
get
something
out
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It

a
feeling

old

we
held
on
for

to
have
his
holiday
there
;
*NL*
but
,
really
,
it
is
impossibly
small

Endless
drawbacks

up

it

``
As
far

never

``
Well

Howards
End

one
of
those
converted
farms

*NL*
They
do
n't
really
do

spend
what
you
will
on
them
.
We
*NL*
messed
away
with
a
garage
all
among
the
wych-elm
roots
,
and
*NL*
last
year
we
enclosed
a
bit
of
the
meadow
and
attempted
a

mockery

Evie
got
rather
keen
on
Alpine
plants

But
it

did
n't
do

no

it
did

do

You
remember

will
remember

the
farm
with
those
abominable
guinea-fowls

and
the
hedge
that
the
old
woman
never
would
cut
properly
,
*NL*
so
that
it
all
went
thin
at
the
bottom

And
,
inside
the

house

the
beams

and
the
staircase
through
a

door

picturesque
enough

not
a

He
*NL*
glanced
over
the
parapet
cheerfully
.
``
Full
tide

And
the
*NL*
position
was
n't
right
either

The

getting

suburban

Either
be
in
London

out

I
say

so
we

taken
a
house

close
to
Sloane

a

place
right
down
in

up

``
What
a

But
the
change
was
in

her
own
voice

had
become
most
sad

they
shook

``
When

So

we
feel
that

have

Margaret
sighed

*NL*
``
Every

Good-bye

*NL*
*NL*
The
tide
had
begun
to
ebb
.
Margaret
leant
over
the
*NL*
parapet
and
watched
it
sadly
.
Mr.
Wilcox
had
forgotten
his
*NL*
wife
,
Helen
her
lover
;
she
herself
was
probably
forgetting
.
*NL*
Every
one
moving

Is
it
worth
while
attempting
the
past
*NL*
when
there
is
this
continual
flux
even
in
the
hearts
of
men
?
*NL*
*NL*
Helen
roused
her
by
saying
:
``
What
a
prosperous
vulgarian
*NL*
Mr.
Wilcox
has
grown
!
I
have
very
little
use
for
him

these

he
did
tell

about

write
to
Mr.

soon

clear
out

*NL*
*NL*
Leonard
accepted
the
invitation
to
tea
next
Saturday
.
But
*NL*
he
was
right
;
the
visit
proved
a
conspicuous
failure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sugar
?
''
said
Margaret
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cake
?
''
said
Helen
.
``
The
big
cake
or
the
little
*NL*
deadlies
?
I
'm
afraid
you
thought
my
letter
rather
odd
,
but
*NL*
we
'll
explain
--
we
are
n't
odd
,
really
--
not
affected
,
really
.
*NL*
We
're
over-expressive
:
that
's
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
a
lady
's
lap-dog
Leonard
did
not
excel
.
He
was
not
*NL*
an
Italian
,
still
less
a
Frenchman
,
in
whose
blood
there
*NL*
runs
the
very
spirit
of
persiflage
and
of
gracious
*NL*
repartee
.
His
wit
was
the
Cockney
's
;
it
opened
no
doors
*NL*
into
imagination
,
and
Helen
was
drawn
up
short
by
``
The
more
*NL*
a
lady
has
to
say
,
the
better
,
''
administered
waggishly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ladies
brighten
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
know
.
The
darlings
are
regular
sunbeams
.
Let
*NL*
me
give
you
a
plate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
like
your
work
?
''
interposed
Margaret
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
,
too
,
was
drawn
up
short
.
He
would
not
have
these
*NL*
women
prying
into
his
work
.
They
were
Romance
,
and
so
was
*NL*
the
room
to
which
he
had
at
last
penetrated
,
with
the
queer
*NL*
sketches
of
people
bathing
upon
its
walls
,
and
so
were
the
*NL*
very
tea-cups
,
with
their
delicate
borders
of
wild
*NL*
strawberries
.
But
he
would
not
let
Romance
interfere
with
*NL*
his
life
.
There
is
the
devil
to
pay
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
enough
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
company
is
the
Porphyrion
,
is
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
's
so
''
--
becoming
rather
offended
.
``
It
's
funny
*NL*
how
things
get
round
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
funny
?
''
asked
Helen
,
who
did
not
follow
the
*NL*
workings
of
his
mind
.
``
It
was
written
as
large
as
life
on
*NL*
your
card
,
and
considering
we
wrote
to
you
there
,
and
that
*NL*
you
replied
on
the
stamped
paper
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
call
the
Porphyrion
one
of
the
big
Insurance
*NL*
Companies
?
''
pursued
Margaret
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
depends
what
you
call
big
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
by
big
,
a
solid
,
well-established
concern
,
that
*NL*
offers
a
reasonably
good
career
to
its
employes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
n't
say
--
some
would
tell
you
one
thing
and
*NL*
others
another
,
''
said
the
employe
uneasily
.
``
For
my
own
*NL*
part
''
--
he
shook
his
head
--
``
I
only
believe
half
I
hear
.
Not
*NL*
that
even
;
it
's
safer
.
Those
clever
ones
come
to
the
worse
*NL*
grief
,
I
've
often
noticed
.
Ah
,
you
ca
n't
be
too
careful

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
drank
,
and
wiped
his
moustache
,
which
was
going
to
be
*NL*
one
of
those
moustaches
that
always
droop
into
*NL*
tea-cups
--
more
bother
than
they
're
worth
,
surely
,
and
not
*NL*
fashionable
either
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
quite
agree
,
and
that
's
why
I
was
curious
to
know
:
is
*NL*
it
a
solid
,
well-established
concern
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Leonard
had
no
idea
.
He
understood
his
own
corner
of
*NL*
the
machine
,
but
nothing
beyond
it
.
He
desired
to
confess
*NL*
neither
knowledge
nor
ignorance
,
and
under
these
*NL*
circumstances
,
another
motion
of
the
head
seemed
safest
.
To
*NL*
him
,
as
to
the
British
public
,
the
Porphyrion
was
the
*NL*
Porphyrion
of
the
advertisement
--
a
giant
,
in
the
classical
*NL*
style
,
but
draped
sufficiently
,
who
held
in
one
hand
a
*NL*
burning
torch
,
and
pointed
with
the
other
to
St.
Paul
's
and
*NL*
Windsor
Castle
.
A
large
sum
of
money
was
inscribed
below
,
*NL*
and
you
drew
your
own
conclusions
.
This
giant
caused
*NL*
Leonard
to
do
arithmetic
and
write
letters
,
to
explain
the
*NL*
regulations
to
new
clients
,
and
re-explain
them
to
old
*NL*
ones
.
A
giant
was
of
an
impulsive
morality
--
one
knew
that
*NL*
much
.
He
would
pay
for
Mrs.
Munt
's
hearth-rug
with
*NL*
ostentatious
haste
,
a
large
claim
he
would
repudiate
*NL*
quietly
,
and
fight
court
by
court
.
But
his
true
fighting
*NL*
weight
,
his
antecedents
,
his
amours
with
other
members
of
*NL*
the
commercial
Pantheon
--
all
these
were
as
uncertain
to
*NL*
ordinary
mortals
as
were
the
escapades
of
Zeus
.
While
the
*NL*
gods
are
powerful
,
we
learn
little
about
them
.
It
is
only
*NL*
in
the
days
of
their
decadence
that
a
strong
light
beats
*NL*
into
heaven
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
were
told
the
Porphyrion
's
no
go
,
''
blurted
Helen
.
*NL*
``
We
wanted
to
tell
you
;
that
's
why
we
wrote
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
friend
of
ours
did
think
that
it
is
unsufficiently
*NL*
reinsured
,
''
said
Margaret
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
Leonard
had
his
clue
.
He
must
praise
the
*NL*
Porphyrion
.
``
You
can
tell
your
friend
,
''
he
said
,
``
that
he
's
*NL*
quite
wrong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
good
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
coloured
a
little
.
In
his
circle
to
be
*NL*
wrong
was
fatal
.
The
Miss
Schlegels
did
not
mind
being
*NL*
wrong
.
They
were
genuinely
glad
that
they
had
been
*NL*
misinformed
.
To
them
nothing
was
fatal
but
evil
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wrong
,
so
to
speak
,
''
he
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
`
so
to
speak
'
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
I
would
n't
say
he
's
right
altogether
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
was
a
blunder
.
``
Then
he
is
right
partly
,
''
said
*NL*
the
elder
woman
,
quick
as
lightning
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leonard
replied
that
every
one
was
right
partly
,
if
it
*NL*
came
to
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Bast
,
I
do
n't
understand
business
,
and
I
dare
say
*NL*
my
questions
are
stupid
,
but
can
you
tell
me
what
makes
a
*NL*
concern
`
right
'
or
`
wrong
'
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Leonard
sat
back
with
a
sigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
friend
,
who
is
also
a
business
man
,
was
so
*NL*
positive
.
He
said
before
Christmas
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
advised
you
to
clear
out
of
it
,
''
concluded
Helen
.
*NL*
``
But
I
do
n't
see
why
he
should
know
better
than
you
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Leonard
rubbed
his
hands
.
He
was
tempted
to
say
that
he
*NL*
knew
nothing
about
the
thing
at
all
.
But
a
commercial
*NL*
training
was
too
strong
for
him
.
Nor
could
he
say
it
was
a
*NL*
bad
thing
,
for
this
would
be
giving
it
away
;
nor
yet
that
it
*NL*
was
good
,
for
this
would
be
giving
it
away
equally
.
He
*NL*
attempted
to
suggest
that
it
was
something
between
the
two
,
*NL*
with
vast
possibilities
in
either
direction
,
but
broke
down
*NL*
under
the
gaze
of
four
sincere
eyes
.
As
yet
he
scarcely
*NL*
distinguished
between
the
two
sisters
.
One
was
more
*NL*
beautiful
and
more
lively
,
but
``
the
Miss
Schlegels
''
still
*NL*
remained
a
composite
Indian
god
,
whose
waving
arms
and
*NL*
contradictory
speeches
were
the
product
of
a
single
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
can
but
see
,
''
he
remarked
,
adding
,
``
as
Ibsen
says
,
*NL*
`
things
happen
.
'
''
He
was
itching
to
talk
about
books
and
*NL*
make
the
most
of
his
romantic
hour
.
Minute
after
minute
*NL*
slipped
away
,
while
the
ladies
,
with
imperfect
skill
,
*NL*
discussed
the
subject
of
reinsurance
or
praised
their
*NL*
anonymous
friend
.
Leonard
grew
annoyed
--
perhaps
rightly
.
*NL*
He
made
vague
remarks
about
not
being
one
of
those
who
*NL*
minded
their
affairs
being
talked
over
by
others
,
but
they
*NL*
did
not
take
the
hint
.
Men
might
have
shown
more
tact
.
*NL*
Women
,
however
tactful
elsewhere
,
are
heavy-handed
here
.
*NL*
They
can
not
see
why
we
should
shroud
our
incomes
and
our
*NL*
prospects
in
a
veil
.
``
How
much
exactly
have
you
,
and
how
*NL*
much
do
you
expect
to
have
next
June
?
''
And
these
were
women
*NL*
with
a
theory
,
who
held
that
reticence
about
money
matters
*NL*
is
absurd
,
and
that
life
would
be
truer
if
each
would
state
*NL*
the
exact
size
of
the
golden
island
upon
which
he
stands
,
*NL*
the
exact
stretch
of
warp
over
which
he
throws
the
woof
that
*NL*
is
not
money
.
How
can
we
do
justice
to
the
pattern
*NL*
otherwise
?
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
precious
minutes
slipped
away
,
and
Jacky
and
*NL*
squalor
came
nearer
.
At
last
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
,
*NL*
and
broke
in
,
reciting
the
names
of
books
feverishly
.
There
*NL*
was
a
moment
of
piercing
joy
when
Margaret
said
,
``
So
YOU
*NL*
like
Carlyle
,
''
and
then
the
door
opened
,
and
``
Mr.
Wilcox
,
*NL*
Miss
Wilcox
''
entered
,
preceded
by
two
prancing
puppies
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
the
dears
!
Oh
,
Evie
,
how
too
impossibly
sweet

''
*NL*
screamed
Helen
,
falling
on
her
hands
and
knees
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
brought
the
little
fellows
round
,
''
said
Mr.
Wilcox
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
bred
'em
myself

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

really

Mr.
Bast
,

and
play
with
puppies

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
got
to
be
going
now

said
Leonard
sourly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But

with
puppies
a
little
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
Ahab
,
that
's
Jezebel

said
Evie
,
who
was
one
*NL*
of
those
who
name
animals
after
the
less
successful
*NL*
characters
of
Old
Testament
history
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
got
to
be
going
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Helen
was
too
much
occupied
with
puppies
to
notice
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Wilcox
,
Mr.
Ba
--
Must
you
be
really
?
Good-bye
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
again
,
''
said
Helen
from
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Leonard
's
gorge
arose
.
Why
should
he
come
again
?
*NL*
What
was
the
good
of
it
?
He
said
roundly
:
``
No
,
I
sha
n't
;
I
*NL*
knew
it
would
be
a
failure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Most
people
would
have
let
him
go
.
``
A
little
mistake
.
*NL*
We
tried
knowing
another
class
--
impossible
.
''
But
the
*NL*
Schlegels
had
never
played
with
life
.
They
had
attempted
*NL*
friendship
,
and
they
would
take
the
consequences
.
Helen
*NL*
retorted
,
``
I
call
that
a
very
rude
remark
.
What
do
you
want
*NL*

turn
on

and
suddenly
the
drawing-room
*NL*
re-echoed
to
a
vulgar
row
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ask
me
why
I
turn
on
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

``
What

*NL*
``
To

Helen
.
``
And
do

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do

quite
happy

He
*NL*
turned
to
Mr.
Wilcox
.
``
I
put
it
to
this
gentleman

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Wilcox
turned
to
Margaret
with
the
air
of
humorous
*NL*
strength
that
he
could
so
well
command
.
``
Are
we
intruding
,
*NL*
Miss
Schlegel
?
Can
we
be
of
any
use

shall
we
go

*NL*
*NL*
But
Margaret
ignored
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
connected
with

company

*NL*

he
drawled
the
word
-RRB-
.
``
I
come

it
's
to
have
my

picked

I
ask
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Highly
unfair

''
said
Mr.
Wilcox
,
drawing
a
gasp
from
*NL*
Evie
,
who
knew
that
her
father
was
becoming
dangerous
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There

that

Most
unfair

There

Not
content
with

pointing
at
Margaret

``
you

n't

''
His
voice
rose
:
he
was
falling
into
the
*NL*
rhythm
of
a
scene
with
Jacky
.
``
But
as
soon
as
I
'm
useful

it
's
a
very
different

for

``

Margaret

*NL*
Laughter
from
Evie

as
at

*NL*
``
You

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
fail

said
Leonard
,
hot
with
*NL*
stupid
anger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
do
I.
''
There
was
a
pause
.
``
You
were
that
last
*NL*
Sunday
--
you
are
this
today
.
Mr.
Bast
!
I
and
my
sister
have
*NL*
talked
you
over
.
We
wanted
to
help
you
;
we
also
supposed
*NL*
you
might
help
us
.
We
did
not
have
you
here
out
of
*NL*
charity
--
which
bores
us
--
but
because
we
hoped
there
would
be
*NL*
a
connection
between
last
Sunday
and
other
days
.
What
is
*NL*
the
good
of
your
stars
and
trees
,
your
sunrise
and
the
wind
,
*NL*
if
they
do
not
enter
into
our
daily
lives
?
They
have
never
*NL*
entered
into
mine
,
but
into
yours
,
we
thought
--
Have
n't
we
*NL*
all
to
struggle
against
life
's
daily
greyness
,
against
*NL*
pettiness
,
against
mechanical
cheerfulness
,
against
*NL*
suspicion
?
I
struggle
by
remembering
my
friends
;
others
I
*NL*
have
known
by
remembering
some
place
--
some
beloved
place
or
*NL*
tree

we
thought
you
one
of
these

*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course

if
there
's
been
any
misunderstanding

*NL*
mumbled
Leonard
,
``
all
I
can
do
is
to
go

But
I
beg
to
*NL*
state

''
He
paused
.
Ahab
and
Jezebel
danced
at
his
boots
*NL*
and
made
him
look
ridiculous
.
``
You
were
picking
my
brain
*NL*
for
official
information

I
can
prove
it

I

He
blew
his
*NL*
nose
and
left
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
I
help
you
now
?

said
Mr.
Wilcox
,
turning
to
*NL*
Margaret
.
``
May
I
have
one
quiet
word
with
him
in
the
hall

*NL*
*NL*
``
Helen

after
him

anything

*NL*
*NL*
Helen
hesitated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
really

said
their
visitor
.
``
Ought
she
to
?

*NL*
*NL*
At
once
she
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
resumed
.
``
I
would
have
chimed
in
,
but
I
felt
that
*NL*
you
could
polish
him
off
for
yourselves
--
I
did
n't
*NL*
interfere
.
You
were
splendid
,
Miss
Schlegel
--
absolutely
*NL*
splendid
.
You
can
take
my
word
for
it
,
but
there
are
very
*NL*
few
women
who
could
have
managed
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
''
said
Margaret
distractedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bowling
him
over
with
those
long
sentences
was
what
*NL*
fetched
me
,

cried
Evie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

indeed

''
chuckled
her
father
;
``
all
that
part
about
*NL*
`
mechanical
cheerfulness

oh

fine

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
very
sorry

said
Margaret
,
collecting
herself
.
*NL*
``
He
's
a
nice
creature
really

I
can
not
think
what
set
him

off

been
most
unpleasant
for
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,

I

did
n't
mind

Then
he
changed
his
mood

He
*NL*
asked
if
he
might
speak
as
an
old
friend
,
and
,
permission
*NL*
given

said
:
``
Ought
n't
you
really
to
be
more
careful
?

*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
laughed
,
though
her
thoughts
still
strayed
*NL*
after
Helen
.
``
Do
you
realize
that
it
's
all
your
fault

she
*NL*
said
.
``
You
're
responsible

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
the
young
man

we
were

Porphyrion

We
warn
him

look
!

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Wilcox
was
annoyed
.
``
I
hardly
consider
that
a
fair
*NL*
deduction
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Obviously
unfair

''
said
Margaret
.
``
I
was
only
thinking
*NL*
how
tangled

are

It

our

mostly

neither

his

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
his

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss

you

kind

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

nodded
Evie

a
little
contemptuously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
behave
much

well

people

then
they

impose
on
you

I
know
the
world

that
type
of
man

and
*NL*
as
soon
as
I
entered
the
room
I
saw
you
had
not
been
*NL*
treating
him
properly

You
must
keep
that
type
at
a
*NL*
distance
.
Otherwise
they
forget
themselves

Sad
,
but
*NL*
true

They
are
n't
our
sort

one
must
face
the
fact

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye-es

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
admit

we
should
never
have
had
the
outburst

he
was
a
gentleman

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
admit
it
willingly

''
said
Margaret
,
who
was
pacing
up
*NL*
and
down
the
room
.
``
A
gentleman
would
have
kept
his

suspicions

himself

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Wilcox
watched
her
with
a
vague
uneasiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
he
suspect
you
of

*NL*
``
Of
wanting

make
money
out

*NL*

Intolerable
brute

But
how
were
you
to
benefit

*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly

How
indeed
!
Just
horrible
,
corroding
*NL*
suspicion

One
touch
of
thought
or
of
goodwill
would
have
*NL*
brushed
it
away
.
Just
the
senseless
fear
that
does
make
men
*NL*
intolerable
brutes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
come
back
to
my
original
point

You
ought
to
be
more
*NL*
careful
,
Miss
Schlegel

Your
servants
ought
to
have
orders
*NL*
not
to
let
such
people
in

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
to
him
frankly
.
``
Let
me
explain
exactly
why
*NL*
we
like
this
man
,
and
want
to
see
him
again

*NL*
*NL*
``
That

your

never

*NL*
``
I
do

Firstly

physical

adventure

just
as
you
do

Yes

go
motoring
and
*NL*
shooting

he
would
like
to
go
camping
out

Secondly
,
he

cares
for
something
special

is
quickest
to

call
that
special
something
poetry

``
Oh

``
No

no

mean
he
may

loathsome

stiff

brain
is
filled
with
the
husks
of
books

culture

horrible

we
want
him
to
wash
out
his
brain

go

to
the
real

We
want

show
him
how
he

country

hesitated

Some
of
her
words
ran
past
Mr.

He
let
them
run
*NL*
past

Others
he
caught
and
criticized
with
admirable
lucidity

you

conclude

is
an
unsuccessful
life

as
you
call

it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Because

*NL*
*NL*
``
One
minute

You
know
nothing

He
probably

has
his
own
joys
and
interests

wife

children

snug
little
*NL*
home

That
's
where
we
practical
fellows

--
he
smiled
--
``
are
*NL*
more
tolerant

We
live

jogging

fairly
well
elsewhere

I
quite
grant

I
look

observe
them
to
be
dull

I

So
,
by
the
way

with

London

I
have
heard
you
rail
against
London

it
seems
a
funny
thing

I
was
very

angry

you

What
do

You
only

see
civilization
from
the
outside

I
do
n't
say
in
your

case

in

many
cases
that
attitude
leads

morbidity

discontent

Socialism

*NL*
*NL*
She
admitted
the
strength
of
his
position

though
it
*NL*
undermined
imagination

As
he
spoke
,
some
outposts
of
*NL*
poetry

perhaps
of
sympathy
fell
ruining

and
she

retreated
to
what
she
called

second

to
the

special
facts

she
said
simply

``

``

cried
the
girl

*NL*
``

Margaret

who
hated
naughtiness
more

than

amusing

he
would
not

discussed
it

trading
on

an
emanicipated

that
our
smug
existence

*NL*
*NL*
As
she
spoke
their
eyes
met
,
and
it
was
as
if
Mr.
*NL*
Wilcox
's
defences
fell
.
She
saw
back
to
the
real
man
in
*NL*
him
.
Unwittingly
she
had
touched
his
emotions
.
A
woman
and
*NL*
two
men
--
they
had
formed
the
magic
triangle
of
sex
,
and
the
*NL*
male
was
thrilled
to
jealousy
,
in
case
the
female
was
*NL*
attracted
by
another
male
.
Love
,
say
the
ascetics
,
reveals
*NL*
our
shameful
kinship
with
the
beasts
.
Be
it
so
:
one
can
*NL*
bear
that
;
jealousy
is
the
real
shame
.
It
is
jealousy
,
not
*NL*
love
,
that
connects
us
with
the
farmyard
intolerably
,
and
*NL*
calls
up
visions
of
two
angry
cocks
and
a
complacent
hen
.
*NL*
Margaret
crushed
complacency
down
because
she
was
*NL*
civilized
.
Mr.
Wilcox
,
uncivilized
,
continued
to
feel
anger
*NL*
long
after
he
had
rebuilt
his
defences
,
and
was
again
*NL*
presenting
a
bastion
to
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Schlegel
,
you
're
a
pair
of
dear
creatures

but
you
*NL*
really
MUST
be
careful
in

uncharitable

What
*NL*
does
your

say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
forget

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely

has
some

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
laughs

I
remember
correctly

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
very

is
n't
he

said
Evie
,
who
had
met
and
*NL*
detested
Tibby
at
Oxford
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
pretty
well

but
I
wonder
what
Helen

doing

*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
very
young

undertake
this

thing

*NL*
said
Mr.
Wilcox
.
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
went
out
into
the
landing
.
She
heard
no
sound
,
*NL*
and
Mr.
Bast
's
topper
was
missing
from
the
hall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Helen
!
''
she
called
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
!
''
replied
a
voice
from
the
library
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
in
there
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

he

*NL*
Margaret
went
to
her

``
Why

you
're
all
alone

she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

it
's
all
right

Meg

Poor

poor
creature

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
back
to
the
Wilcoxes

tell
me
later

Mr.
W.

much
concerned

and
slightly
titillated
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
've
no
patience
with
him

I
hate
him

Poor
dear
*NL*
Mr.
Bast

he
wanted
to
talk
literature
,
and
we
would
talk
*NL*
business
.
Such
a
muddle
of
a
man
,
and
yet
so
worth
pulling
*NL*
through
.
I
like
him
extraordinarily
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
done
,
''
said
Margaret
,
kissing
her
,
``
but
come
into
*NL*
the
drawing-room
now
,
and
do
n't
talk
about
him
to
the
*NL*
Wilcoxes
.
Make
light
of
the
whole
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Helen
came
and
behaved
with
a
cheerfulness
that
*NL*
reassured
their
visitor
--
this
hen
at
all
events
was
fancy-free
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
gone
with
my
blessing
,
''
she
cried
,
``
and
now
for
puppies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
drove
away
,
Mr.
Wilcox
said
to
his
daughter
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
really
concerned
at
the
way
those
girls
go
on
.
*NL*
They
are
as
clever
as
you
make
'em
,
but
unpractical
--
God
*NL*
bless
me
!
One
of
these
days
they
'll
go
too
far
.
Girls
like
*NL*
that
ought
n't
to
live
alone
in
London
.
Until
they
marry
,
*NL*
they
ought
to
have
someone
to
look
after
them
.
We
must
look
*NL*
in
more
often
--
we
're
better
than
no
one
.
You
like
them
,
*NL*
do
n't
you
,
Evie
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Evie
replied
:
``
Helen
's
right
enough
,
but
I
ca
n't
stand
*NL*
the
toothy
one
.
And
I
should
n't
have
called
either
of
them
girls
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Evie
had
grown
up
handsome
.
Dark-eyed
,
with
the
glow
of
*NL*
youth
under
sunburn
,
built
firmly
and
firm-lipped
,
she
was
*NL*
the
best
the
Wilcoxes
could
do
in
the
way
of
feminine
*NL*
beauty
.
For
the
present
,
puppies
and
her
father
were
the
*NL*
only
things
she
loved
,
but
the
net
of
matrimony
was
being
*NL*
prepared
for
her
,
and
a
few
days
later
she
was
attracted
to
*NL*
a
Mr.
Percy
Cahill
,
an
uncle
of
Mrs.
Charles
,
and
he
was
*NL*
attracted
to
her

*NL*
Chapter
17
*NL*
*NL*
The
Age
of
Property
holds
bitter
moments
even
for
a
*NL*
proprietor
.
When
a
move
is
imminent
,
furniture
becomes
*NL*
ridiculous
,
and
Margaret
now
lay
awake
at
nights
wondering
*NL*
where
,
where
on
earth
they
and
all
their
belongings
would
be
*NL*
deposited
in
September
next
.
Chairs
,
tables
,
pictures
,
*NL*
books
,
that
had
rumbled
down
to
them
through
the
*NL*
generations
,
must
rumble
forward
again
like
a
slide
of
*NL*
rubbish
to
which
she
longed
to
give
the
final
push
,
and
send
*NL*
toppling
into
the
sea
.
But
there
were
all
their
father
's
*NL*
books
--
they
never
read
them
,
but
they
were
their
father
's
,
*NL*
and
must
be
kept
.
There
was
the
marble-topped
*NL*
chiffonier
--
their
mother
had
set
store
by
it
,
they
could
not
*NL*
remember
why
.
Round
every
knob
and
cushion
in
the
house
*NL*
sentiment
gathered
,
a
sentiment
that
was
at
times
personal
,
*NL*
but
more
often
a
faint
piety
to
the
dead
,
a
prolongation
of
*NL*
rites
that
might
have
ended
at
the
grave
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
absurd
,
if
you
came
to
think
of
it
;
Helen
and
*NL*
Tibby
came
to
think
of
it
:
Margaret
was
too
busy
with
the
*NL*
house-agents
.
The
feudal
ownership
of
land
did
bring
*NL*
dignity
,
whereas
the
modern
ownership
of
movables
is
*NL*
reducing
us
again
to
a
nomadic
horde
.
We
are
reverting
to
*NL*
the
civilization
of
luggage
,
and
historians
of
the
future
*NL*
will
note
how
the
middle
classes
accreted
possessions
*NL*
without
taking
root
in
the
earth
,
and
may
find
in
this
the
*NL*
secret
of
their
imaginative
poverty
.
The
Schlegels
were
*NL*
certainly
the
poorer
for
the
loss
of
Wickham
Place
.
It
had
*NL*
helped
to
balance
their
lives
,
and
almost
to
counsel
them
.
*NL*
Nor
is
their
ground-landlord
spiritually
the
richer
.
He
has
*NL*
built
flats
on
its
site
,
his
motor-cars
grow
swifter
,
his
*NL*
exposures
of
Socialism
more
trenchant
.
But
he
has
spilt
the
*NL*
precious
distillation
of
the
years
,
and
no
chemistry
of
his
*NL*
can
give
it
back
to
society
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
grew
depressed
;
she
was
anxious
to
settle
on
a
*NL*
house
before
they
left
town
to
pay
their
annual
visit
to
*NL*
Mrs.
Munt
.
She
enjoyed
this
visit
,
and
wanted
to
have
her
*NL*
mind
at
ease
for
it
.
Swanage
,
though
dull
,
was
stable
,
and
*NL*
this
year
she
longed
more
than
usual
for
its
fresh
air
and
*NL*
for
the
magnificent
downs
that
guard
it
on
the
north
.
But
*NL*
London
thwarted
her
;
in
its
atmosphere
she
could
not
*NL*
concentrate
.
London
only
stimulates
,
it
can
not
sustain
;
and
*NL*
Margaret
,
hurrying
over
its
surface
for
a
house
without
*NL*
knowing
what
sort
of
a
house
she
wanted
,
was
paying
for
many
*NL*
a
thrilling
sensation
in
the
past
.
She
could
not
even
break
*NL*
loose
from
culture
,
and
her
time
was
wasted
by
concerts
*NL*
which
it
would
be
a
sin
to
miss
,
and
invitations
which
it
*NL*
would
never
do
to
refuse
.
At
last
she
grew
desperate
;
she
*NL*
resolved
that
she
would
go
nowhere
and
be
at
home
to
no
one
*NL*
until
she
found
a
house
,
and
broke
the
resolution
in
half
an
*NL*
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
she
had
humorously
lamented
that
she
had
never
been
*NL*
to
Simpson
's
restaurant
in
the
Strand
.
Now
a
note
arrived
*NL*
from
Miss
Wilcox
,
asking
her
to
lunch
there
.
Mr.
Cahill
was
*NL*
coming
,
and
the
three
would
have
such
a
jolly
chat
,
and
*NL*
perhaps
end
up
at
the
Hippodrome
.
Margaret
had
no
strong
*NL*
regard
for
Evie
,
and
no
desire
to
meet
her
fiance
,
and
she
*NL*
was
surprised
that
Helen
,
who
had
been
far
funnier
about
*NL*
Simpson
's
,
had
not
been
asked
instead
.
But
the
invitation
*NL*
touched
her
by
its
intimate
tone
.
She
must
know
Evie
Wilcox
*NL*
better
than
she
supposed
,
and
declaring
that
she
``
simply
*NL*
must
,
''
she
accepted
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
she
saw
Evie
at
the
entrance
of
the
restaurant
,
*NL*
staring
fiercely
at
nothing
after
the
fashion
of
athletic
*NL*
women
,
her
heart
failed
her
anew
.
Miss
Wilcox
had
changed
*NL*
perceptibly
since
her
engagement
.
Her
voice
was
gruffer
,
*NL*
her
manner
more
downright
,
and
she
was
inclined
to
patronize
*NL*
the
more
foolish
virgin
.
Margaret
was
silly
enough
to
be
*NL*
pained
at
this
.
Depressed
at
her
isolation
,
she
saw
not
*NL*
only
houses
and
furniture
,
but
the
vessel
of
life
itself
*NL*
slipping
past
her
,
with
people
like
Evie
and
Mr.
Cahill
on
board
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
moments
when
virtue
and
wisdom
fail
us
,
and
*NL*
one
of
them
came
to
her
at
Simpson
's
in
the
Strand
.
As
she
*NL*
trod
the
staircase
,
narrow
,
but
carpeted
thickly
,
as
she
*NL*
entered
the
eating-room
,
where
saddles
of
mutton
were
being
*NL*
trundled
up
to
expectant
clergymen
,
she
had
a
strong
,
if
*NL*
erroneous
,
conviction
of
her
own
futility
,
and
wished
she
*NL*
had
never
come
out
of
her
backwater
,
where
nothing
happened
*NL*
except
art
and
literature
,
and
where
no
one
ever
got
married
*NL*
or
succeeded
in
remaining
engaged
.
Then
came
a
little
*NL*
surprise
.
``
Father
might
be
of
the
party
--
yes
,
Father
was
.
''
*NL*
With
a
smile
of
pleasure
she
moved
forward
to
greet
him
,
and
*NL*
her
feeling
of
loneliness
vanished
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
I
'd
get
round
if
I
could
,
''
said
he
.
``
Evie
*NL*
told
me
of
her
little
plan
,
so
I
just
slipped
in
and
secured
*NL*
a
table
.
Always
secure
a
table
first
.
Evie
,
do
n't
pretend
*NL*
you
want
to
sit
by
your
old
father
,
because
you
do
n't
.
Miss
*NL*
Schlegel
,
come
in
my
side
,
out
of
pity
.
My
goodness
,
but
*NL*
you
look
tired
!
Been
worrying
round
after
your
young
clerks
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
after
houses
,
''
said
Margaret
,
edging
past
him
into
*NL*
the
box
.
``
I
'm
hungry
,
not
tired
;
I
want
to
eat
heaps
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
good
.
What
'll
you
have
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fish
pie
,
''
said
she
,
with
a
glance
at
the
menu
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fish
pie
!
Fancy
coming
for
fish
pie
to
Simpson
's
.
*NL*
It
's
not
a
bit
the
thing
to
go
for
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
for
something
for
me
,
then
,
''
said
Margaret
,
pulling
*NL*
off
her
gloves
.
Her
spirits
were
rising
,
and
his
reference
*NL*
to
Leonard
Bast
had
warmed
her
curiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Saddle
of
mutton
,
''
said
he
after
profound
reflection
:
*NL*
``
and
cider
to
drink
.
That
's
the
type
of
thing
.
I
like
this
*NL*
place
,
for
a
joke
,
once
in
a
way
.
It
is
so
thoroughly
Old
*NL*
English
.
Do
n't
you
agree
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Margaret
,
who
did
n't
.
The
order
was
given
,
*NL*
the
joint
rolled
up
,
and
the
carver
,
under
Mr.
Wilcox
's
*NL*
direction
,
cut
the
meat
where
it
was
succulent
,
and
piled
*NL*
their
plates
high
.
Mr.
Cahill
insisted
on
sirloin
,
but
*NL*
admitted
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
later
on
.
He
and
Evie
*NL*
soon
fell
into
a
conversation
of
the
``
No
,
I
did
n't
;
yes
,
you
*NL*
did
''
type
--
conversation
which
,
though
fascinating
to
those
*NL*
who
are
engaged
in
it
,
neither
desires
nor
deserves
the
*NL*
attention
of
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
golden
rule
to
tip
the
carver
.
Tip
everywhere
's
*NL*
my
motto
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
it
does
make
life
more
human

``
Then

The
torrent
of
their
love
,
having
splashed
these
drops
*NL*
at
Margaret
,
swept
away
on
its
habitual
course
.
She
*NL*
sympathized
with
it
now
,
for
a
little
comfort
had
restored
*NL*
her
geniality
.
Speech
and
silence
pleased
her
equally
,
and
*NL*
while
Mr.
Wilcox
made
some
preliminary
inquiries
about
*NL*
cheese
,
her
eyes
surveyed
the
restaurant
,
and
admired
its
*NL*
well-calculated
tributes
to
the
solidity
of
our
past
.
*NL*
Though
no
more
Old
English
than
the
works
of
Kipling
,
it
had
*NL*
selected
its
reminiscences
so
adroitly
that
her
criticism
*NL*
was
lulled
,
and
the
guests
whom
it
was
nourishing
for
*NL*
imperial
purposes
bore
the
outer
semblance
of
Parson
Adams
*NL*
or
Tom
Jones
.
Scraps
of
their
talk
jarred
oddly
on
the
*NL*
ear
.
``
Right
you
are
!
I
'll
cable
out
to
Uganda
this
*NL*
evening

came
from
the
table
behind

``
Their
Emperor
wants

war

well

him
have
it

was
the
opinion
of
a
*NL*
clergyman
.
She
smiled
at
such
incongruities
.
``
Next

*NL*
she
said
to
Mr.

pushing
her

towards

him
for
some
more

surprised

changed
the

it

no

women
may
say
anything

was
one
of
his
holiest

beliefs

and
he
only
retorted

with
a
gay
smile
:
``
I
do

*NL*
In
time
they
finished
lunch
,
and
Margaret
,
who
had
*NL*
excused
herself
from
the
Hippodrome
,
took
her
leave
.
Evie
*NL*
had
scarcely
addressed
her
,
and
she
suspected
that
the
*NL*
entertainment
had
been
planned
by
the
father
.
He
and
she
*NL*
were
advancing
out
of
their
respective
families
towards
a
*NL*
more
intimate
acquaintance
.
It
had
begun
long
ago
.
She
had
*NL*
been
his
wife
's
friend
,
and
,
as
such
,
he
had
given
her
that
*NL*
silver
vinaigrette
as
a
memento
.
It
was
pretty
of
him
to
*NL*
have
given
that
vinaigrette
,
and
he
had
always
preferred
her
*NL*
to
Helen
--
unlike
most
men
.
But
the
advance
had
been
*NL*
astonishing
lately
.
They
had
done
more
in
a
week
than
in
*NL*
two
years
,
and
were
really
beginning
to
know
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
forget
his
promise
to
sample
Eustace
Miles
,
*NL*
and
asked
him
as
soon
as
she
could
secure
Tibby
as
his
*NL*
chaperon
.
He
came
,
and
partook
of
body-building
dishes
with
*NL*
humility
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
morning
the
Schlegels
left

Chapter
18
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
were
seated
at
Aunt
Juley
's
breakfast-table
at
The
*NL*
Bays
,
parrying
her
excessive
hospitality
and
enjoying
the
*NL*
view
of
the
bay
,
a
letter
came
for
Margaret
and
threw
her
*NL*
into
perturbation
.
It
was
from
Mr.
Wilcox
.
It
announced
an
*NL*
``
important
change
''
in
his
plans
.
Owing
to
Evie
's
marriage
,
*NL*
he
had
decided
to
give
up
his
house
in
Ducie
Street
,
and
was
*NL*
willing
to
let
it
on
a
yearly
tenancy
.
It
was
a
*NL*
businesslike
letter
,
and
stated
frankly
what
he
would
do
for
*NL*
them
and
what
he
would
not
do
.
Also
the
rent
.
If
they
*NL*
approved
,
Margaret
was
to
come
up
AT
ONCE
--
the
words
were
*NL*
underlined
,
as
is
necessary
when
dealing
with
women
--
and
to
*NL*
go
over
the
house
with
him
.
If
they
disapproved
,
a
wire
*NL*
would
oblige
,
as
he
should
put
it
into
the
hands
of
an
agent
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
letter
perturbed
,
because
she
was
not
sure
what
it
*NL*
meant
.
If
he
liked
her
,
if
he
had
manoeuvred
to
get
her
to
*NL*
Simpson
's
,
might
this
be
a
manoeuvre
to
get
her
to
London
,
*NL*
and
result
in
an
offer
of
marriage
?
She
put
it
to
herself
*NL*
as
indelicately
as
possible
,
in
the
hope
that
her
brain
*NL*
would
cry
,
``
Rubbish
,
you
're
a
self-conscious
fool
!
''
But
her
*NL*
brain
only
tingled
a
little
and
was
silent
,
and
for
a
time
*NL*
she
sat
gazing
at
the
mincing
waves
,
and
wondering
whether
*NL*
the
news
would
seem
strange
to
the
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
she
began
speaking
,
the
sound
of
her
own
*NL*
voice
reassured
her
.
There
could
be
nothing
in
it
.
The
*NL*
replies
also
were
typical
,
and
in
the
buff
of
conversation
*NL*
her
fears
vanished
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
need
n't
go
though
--
''
began
her
hostess
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
need
n't
,
but
had
n't
I
better
?
It
's
really
getting
*NL*
rather
serious
.
We
let
chance
after
chance
slip
,
and
the
*NL*
end
of
it
is
we
shall
be
bundled
out
bag
and
baggage
into
*NL*
the
street
.
We
do
n't
know
what
we
WANT
,
that
's
the
mischief
*NL*
with
us
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
we
have
no
real
ties
,
''
said
Helen
,
helping
herself
*NL*
to
toast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sha
n't
I
go
up
to
town
today
,
take
the
house
if
it
's
*NL*
the
least
possible
,
and
then
come
down
by
the
afternoon
*NL*
train
tomorrow
,
and
start
enjoying
myself
.
I
shall
be
no
*NL*
fun
to
myself
or
to
others
until
this
business
is
off
my
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
wo
n't
do
anything
rash
,
Margaret
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
nothing
rash
to
do

*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
ARE

Wilcoxes

said
Tibby
,
a
question
that
*NL*
sounds
silly
,
but
was
really
extremely
subtle
,
as
his
aunt
*NL*
found
to
her
cost
when
she
tried
to
answer
it
.
``
I
do
n't
*NL*
MANAGE
the
Wilcoxes
;
I
do
n't
see
where
they
come
IN

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
more
do
I
,
''
agreed
Helen
.
``
It
's
funny
that
we
just
*NL*
do
n't
lose
sight
of
them

Out
of
all
our

acquaintances
,
Mr.
Wilcox
is
the
only
one
who
has
stuck

It
*NL*
is
now
over
three
years

have
drifted
away

time

``

``

Margaret

getting
up

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
all
depends
what
meaning
you

the

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It

*NL*
*NL*
``

'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Margaret
spoke
rather
seriously
.
``
I
think
,
''
she
*NL*
said
,
``
that
our
race
is
degenerating
.
We
can
not
settle
even
*NL*
this
little
thing
;
what
will
it
be
like
when
we
have
to
*NL*
settle
a
big
one
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
be
as
easy
as
eating
,
''
returned
Helen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
thinking
of
Father
.
How
could
he
settle
to
leave
*NL*
Germany
as
he
did
,
when
he
had
fought
for
it
as
a
young
man
,
*NL*
and
all
his
feelings
and
friends
were
Prussian
?
How
could
*NL*
he
break
loose
with
Patriotism
and
begin
aiming
at
something
*NL*
else
?
It
would
have
killed
me
.
When
he
was
nearly
forty
he
*NL*
could
change
countries
and
ideals
--
and
we
,
at
our
age
,
ca
n't
*NL*
change
houses
.
It
's
humiliating
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
father
may
have
been
able
to
change
countries
,
''
*NL*
said
Mrs.
Munt
with
asperity
,
``
and
that
may
or
may
not
be
a
*NL*
good
thing
.
But
he
could
change
houses
no
better
than
you
*NL*
can
,
in
fact
,
much
worse
.
Never
shall
I
forget
what
poor
*NL*
Emily
suffered
in
the
move
from
Manchester
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
it
,
''
cried
Helen
.
``
I
told
you
so
.
It
is
the
*NL*
little
things
one
bungles
at
.
The
big
,
real
ones
are
*NL*
nothing
when
they
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bungle
,
my
dear
!
You
are
too
little
to
recollect
--
in
*NL*
fact
,
you
were
n't
there
.
But
the
furniture
was
actually
in
*NL*
the
vans
and
on
the
move
before
the
lease
for
Wickham
Place
*NL*
was
signed
,
and
Emily
took
train
with
baby
--
who
was
Margaret
*NL*
then
--
and
the
smaller
luggage
for
London
,
without
so
much
as
*NL*
knowing
where
her
new
home
would
be
.
Getting
away
from
that
*NL*
house
may
be
hard
,
but
it
is
nothing
to
the
misery
that
we
*NL*
all
went
through
getting
you
into
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Helen
,
with
her
mouth
full
,
cried
:
``
And
that
's
the
man
*NL*
who
beat
the
Austrians
,
and
the
Danes
,
and
the
French
,
and
*NL*
who
beat
the
Germans
that
were
inside
himself
.
And
we
're
*NL*
like
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak
for
yourself
,
''
said
Tibby
.
``
Remember
that
I
am
*NL*
cosmopolitan
,
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Helen
may
be
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
she
's
right
,
''
said
Helen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Helen
might
be
right
,
but
she
did
not
go
up
to
London
.
*NL*
Margaret
did
that
.
An
interrupted
holiday
is
the
worst
of
*NL*
the
minor
worries
,
and
one
may
be
pardoned
for
feeling
*NL*
morbid
when
a
business
letter
snatches
one
away
from
the
sea
*NL*
and
friends
.
She
could
not
believe
that
her
father
had
ever
*NL*
felt
the
same
.
Her
eyes
had
been
troubling
her
lately
,
so
*NL*
that
she
could
not
read
in
the
train
,
and
it
bored
her
to
*NL*
look
at
the
landscape
,
which
she
had
seen
but
yesterday
.
At
*NL*
Southampton
she
``
waved
''
to
Frieda
:
Frieda
was
on
her
way
*NL*
down
to
join
them
at
Swanage
,
and
Mrs.
Munt
had
calculated
*NL*
that
their
trains
would
cross
.
But
Frieda
was
looking
the
*NL*
other
way
,
and
Margaret
travelled
on
to
town
feeling
*NL*
solitary
and
old-maidish
.
How
like
an
old
maid
to
fancy
*NL*
that
Mr.
Wilcox
was
courting
her
!
She
had
once
visited
a
*NL*
spinster
--
poor
,
silly
,
and
unattractive
--
whose
mania
it
was
*NL*
that
every
man
who
approached
her
fell
in
love
.
How
*NL*
Margaret
's
heart
had
bled
for
the
deluded
thing
!
How
she
*NL*
had
lectured
,
reasoned
,
and
in
despair
acquiesced
!
``
I
may
*NL*
have
been
deceived
by
the
curate
,
my
dear
,
but
the
young
*NL*
fellow
who
brings
the
midday
post
really
is
fond
of
me
,
and
*NL*
has
,
as
a
matter
fact
--
''
It
had
always
seemed
to
her
the
*NL*
most
hideous
corner
of
old
age
,
yet
she
might
be
driven
into
*NL*
it
herself
by
the
mere
pressure
of
virginity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Wilcox
met
her
at
Waterloo
himself
.
She
felt
*NL*
certain
that
he
was
not
the
same
as
usual
;
for
one
thing
,
he
*NL*
took
offence
at
everything
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
awfully
kind
of
you
,
''
she
began
,
``
but
I
'm
*NL*
afraid
it
's
not
going
to
do
.
The
house
has
not
been
built
*NL*
that
suits
the
Schlegel
family
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
Have
you
come
up
determined
not
to

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
exactly

In
that
case
let
's
be
starting

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
lingered
to
admire
the
motor
,
which
was
new
and
a
*NL*
fairer
creature
than
the
vermilion
giant
that
had
borne
Aunt
*NL*
Juley
to
her
doom
three
years
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Presumably
it
's
very
beautiful
,
''
she
said
.
``
How
do
you
*NL*
like
it
,
Crane
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
let
's
be
starting

''
repeated
her
host
.
``
How
on
*NL*
earth
did
you
know
that
my
chauffeur
was
called
Crane
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
know
Crane
:
I
've
been
for
a
drive
with
Evie
*NL*
once
.
I
know
that
you
've
got
a
parlourmaid
called
Milton
.
*NL*
I
know
all
sorts
of
things

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Evie

he
echoed
in
injured
tones
.
``
You
wo
n't

She
's

out
with
Cahill

It

no

I
can
tell
*NL*
you
,
being
left
so
much
alone
.
I
've
got
my
work
all
*NL*
day
--
indeed
,
a
great
deal
too
much
of
it

but
when
I
come
*NL*
home
in
the
evening
,
I
tell
you

I

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
my
absurd
way
,
I
'm
lonely
too
,
''
Margaret
replied
.
*NL*
``
It
's
heart-breaking
to
leave
one
's
old
home
.
I
scarcely
*NL*
remember
anything
before
Wickham
Place

and
Helen
and
Tibby
*NL*
were
born
there
.
Helen
says
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
,
too
,

lonely

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Horribly
.
Hullo
,
Parliament
's
back
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Wilcox
glanced
at
Parliament
contemptuously
.
The
*NL*
more
important
ropes
of
life
lay
elsewhere
.
``
Yes
,
they
are
*NL*
talking
again

''
said
he
.
``
But
you
were
going
to
say
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
some
rubbish
about
furniture

Helen
says
it
alone
*NL*
endures
while
men
and
houses
perish
,
and
that
in
the
end
the
*NL*
world
will
be
a
desert
of
chairs
and
sofas
--
just
imagine
*NL*
it
!

rolling
through
infinity
with
no
one
to
sit
upon
them

*NL*
*NL*
``
Your

likes
her
little
joke

``
She
says
`
Yes

says
`

to
Ducie
Street
.
*NL*
It
's
no
fun
helping
us
,
Mr.
Wilcox
,
I
assure
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
as
unpractical
as
you
pretend
.
I
shall
*NL*
never
believe
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
laughed
.
But
she
was
--
quite
as
unpractical
.
*NL*
She
could
not
concentrate
on
details
.
Parliament
,
the
*NL*
Thames
,
the
irresponsive
chauffeur
,
would
flash
into
the
*NL*
field
of
house-hunting
,
and
all
demand
some
comment
or
*NL*
response
.
It
is
impossible
to
see
modern
life
steadily
and
*NL*
see
it
whole
,
and
she
had
chosen
to
see
it
whole
.
Mr.
*NL*
Wilcox
saw
steadily
.
He
never
bothered
over
the
mysterious
*NL*
or
the
private
.
The
Thames
might
run
inland
from
the
sea
,
*NL*
the
chauffeur
might
conceal
all
passion
and
philosophy
*NL*
beneath
his
unhealthy
skin
.
They
knew
their
own
business
,
*NL*
and
he
knew
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
she
liked
being
with
him
.
He
was
not
a
rebuke
,
but
*NL*
a
stimulus
,
and
banished
morbidity
.
Some
twenty
years
her
*NL*
senior
,
he
preserved
a
gift
that
she
supposed
herself
to
*NL*
have
already
lost
--
not
youth
's
creative
power
,
but
its
*NL*
self-confidence
and
optimism
.
He
was
so
sure
that
it
was
a
*NL*
very
pleasant
world
.
His
complexion
was
robust
,
his
hair
*NL*
had
receded
but
not
thinned
,
the
thick
moustache
and
the
*NL*
eyes
that
Helen
had
compared
to
brandy-balls
had
an
*NL*
agreeable
menace
in
them
,
whether
they
were
turned
towards
*NL*
the
slums
or
towards
the
stars
.
Some
day
--
in
the
*NL*
millennium
--
there
may
be
no
need
for
his
type
.
At
present
,
*NL*
homage
is
due
to
it
from
those
who
think
themselves
*NL*
superior
,
and
who
possibly
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
all
events
you
responded
to
my
telegram
promptly
,
''
*NL*
he
remarked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
even
I
know
a
good
thing
when
I
see
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
glad
you
do
n't
despise
the
goods
of
this
world

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heavens
,
no
!
Only
idiots
and
prigs
do
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
,
very
glad
,
''
he
repeated
,
suddenly
softening
*NL*
and
turning
to
her
,
as
if
the
remark
had
pleased
him
.
*NL*
``
There
is
so
much
cant
talked
in
would-be
intellectual
*NL*
circles
.
I
am
glad
you
do
n't
share
it
.
Self-denial
is
all
*NL*
very
well
as
a
means
of
strengthening
the
character
.
But
I
*NL*
ca
n't
stand
those
people
who
run
down
comforts
.
They
have
*NL*
usually
some
axe
to
grind
.
Can
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Comforts
are
of
two
kinds
,
''
said
Margaret
,
who
was
*NL*
keeping
herself
in
hand
--
``
those
we
can
share
with
others
,
*NL*
like
fire
,
weather
,
or
music
;
and
those
we
ca
n't
--
food
,
for
*NL*
instance
.
It
depends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
reasonable
comforts
,
of
course
.
I
should
n't
*NL*
like
to
think
that
you
--
''
He
bent
nearer
;
the
sentence
died
*NL*
unfinished
.
Margaret
's
head
turned
very
stupid
,
and
the
*NL*
inside
of
it
seemed
to
revolve
like
the
beacon
in
a
*NL*
lighthouse
.
He
did
not
kiss
her
,
for
the
hour
was
half-past
*NL*
twelve
,
and
the
car
was
passing
by
the
stables
of
Buckingham
*NL*
Palace
.
But
the
atmosphere
was
so
charged
with
emotion
that
*NL*
people
only
seemed
to
exist
on
her
account
,
and
she
was
*NL*
surprised
that
Crane
did
not
realize
this
,
and
turn
round
.
*NL*
Idiot
though
she
might
be
,
surely
Mr.
Wilcox
was
more
--
how
*NL*
should
one
put
it
?
--
more
psychological
than
usual
.
Always
*NL*
a
good
judge
of
character
for
business
purposes
,
he
seemed
*NL*
this
afternoon
to
enlarge
his
field
,
and
to
note
qualities
*NL*
outside
neatness
,
obedience
,
and
decision
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
go
over
the
whole
house
,
''
she
announced
when
*NL*
they
arrived
.
``
As
soon
as
I
get
back
to
Swanage
,
which
will
*NL*
be
tomorrow
afternoon
,
I
'll
talk
it
over
once
more
with
*NL*
Helen
and
Tibby
,
and
wire
you
`
yes

or
`
no

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Right
.
The
dining-room
.
''
And
they
began
their
survey
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dining-room
was
big
,
but
over-furnished
.
Chelsea
*NL*
would
have
moaned
aloud
.
Mr.
Wilcox
had
eschewed
those
*NL*
decorative
schemes
that
wince
,
and
relent
,
and
refrain
,
and
*NL*
achieve
beauty
by
sacrificing
comfort
and
pluck
.
After
so
*NL*
much
self-colour
and
self-denial
,
Margaret
viewed
with
*NL*
relief
the
sumptuous
dado
,
the
frieze
,
the
gilded
*NL*
wall-paper
,
amid
whose
foliage
parrots
sang
.
It
would
never
*NL*
do
with
her
own
furniture
,
but
those
heavy
chairs
,
that
*NL*
immense
side-board
loaded
with
presentation
plate
,
stood
up
*NL*
against
its
pressure
like
men
.
The
room
suggested
men
,
and
*NL*
Margaret
,
keen
to
derive
the
modern
capitalist
from
the
*NL*
warriors
and
hunters
of
the
past
,
saw
it
as
an
ancient
*NL*
guest-hall
,
where
the
lord
sat
at
meat
among
his
thanes
.
*NL*
Even
the
Bible
--
the
Dutch
Bible
that
Charles
had
brought
*NL*
back
from
the
Boer
War
--
fell
into
position
.
Such
a
room
*NL*
admitted
loot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
the
entrance-hall
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
entrance-hall
was
paved
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
we
fellows
smoke

''
*NL*
*NL*
We
fellows
smoked
in
chairs
of
maroon
leather
.
It
was
*NL*
as
if
a
motor-car
had
spawned
.
``
Oh
,
jolly
!
''
said
Margaret
,
*NL*
sinking
into
one
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
like
it
?
''
he
said
,
fixing
his
eyes
on
her
*NL*
upturned
face
,
and
surely
betraying
an
almost
intimate
*NL*
note
.
``
It
's
all
rubbish

*NL*
Is
n't

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
``
Ah
,
well
.
Mr.
Wilcox
,
are
n't
you
ever
amused
at
the
*NL*
solemnity
with
which
we
middle
classes
approach
the
subject
*NL*
of
houses
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
proceeded
to
the
drawing-room
.
Chelsea
managed
*NL*
better
here
.
It
was
sallow
and
ineffective
.
One
could
*NL*
visualize
the
ladies
withdrawing
to
it
,
while
their
lords
*NL*
discussed
life
's
realities
below
,
to
the
accompaniment
of
*NL*
cigars
.
Had
Mrs.
Wilcox
's
drawing-room
looked
thus
at
*NL*
Howards
End
?
Just
as
this
thought
entered
Margaret
's
brain
,
*NL*
Mr.
Wilcox
did
ask
her
to
be
his
wife
,
and
the
knowledge
*NL*
that
she
had
been
right
so
overcame
her
that
she
nearly
fainted
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
proposal
was
not
to
rank
among
the
world
's
great
*NL*
love
scenes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Schlegel
''
--
his
voice
was
firm
--
``
I
have
had
you
up
*NL*
on
false
pretences

I
want
to
speak
about
a
much
more
*NL*
serious
matter
than
a
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
almost
answered
:
``
I
know
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Could
you
be
induced
to
share
my
--
is
it
probable

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Mr.
Wilcox
!
''
she
interrupted
,
holding
the
piano
and
*NL*
averting
her
eyes
.
``
I
see
,
I
see
.
I
will
write
to
you
*NL*
afterwards
if
I
may
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
began
to
stammer
.
``
Miss
Schlegel
--
Margaret
--
you
*NL*
do
n't
understand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
!
Indeed
,
yes
!
''
said
Margaret
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
asking
you
to
be
my
wife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
deep
already
was
her
sympathy
,
that
when
he
said
,
``
I
*NL*
am
asking
you
to
be
my
wife
,
''
she
made
herself
give
a
little
*NL*
start
.
She
must
show
surprise
if
he
expected
it
.
An
*NL*
immense
joy
came
over
her
.
It
was
indescribable
.
It
had
*NL*
nothing
to
do
with
humanity
,
and
most
resembled
the
*NL*
all-pervading
happiness
of
fine
weather
.
Fine
weather
is
*NL*
due
to
the
sun
,
but
Margaret
could
think
of
no
central
*NL*
radiance
here
.
She
stood
in
his
drawing-room
happy
,
and
*NL*
longing
to
give
happiness
.
On
leaving
him
she
realized
that
*NL*
the
central
radiance
had
been
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
n't
offended
,
Miss
Schlegel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
could
I
be
offended
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
moment
's
pause
.
He
was
anxious
to
get
rid
*NL*
of
her
,
and
she
knew
it
.
She
had
too
much
intuition
to
look
*NL*
at
him
as
he
struggled
for
possessions
that
money
can
not
*NL*
buy
.
He
desired
comradeship
and
affection
,
but
he
feared
*NL*
them
,
and
she
,
who
had
taught
herself
only
to
desire
,
and
*NL*
could
have
clothed
the
struggle
with
beauty
,
held
back
,
and
*NL*
hesitated
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
,
''
she
continued
.
``
You
will
have
a
letter
from
*NL*
me
--
I
am
going
back
to
Swanage
tomorrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
,
and
it
's
you
I
thank
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
may
order
the
motor
round
,
may
n't
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
would
be
most
kind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
I
had
written
instead
.
Ought
I
to
have
written
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
just
one
question
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
shook
her
head
.
He
looked
a
little
bewildered
,
and
*NL*
they
parted
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
parted
without
shaking
hands
:
she
had
kept
the
*NL*
interview
,
for
his
sake
,
in
tints
of
the
quietest
grey
.
Yet
*NL*
she
thrilled
with
happiness
ere
she
reached
her
own
house
.
*NL*
Others
had
loved
her
in
the
past
,
if
one
may
apply
to
their
*NL*
brief
desires
so
grave
a
word
,
but
those
others
had
been
*NL*
``
ninnies
''
--
young
men
who
had
nothing
to
do
,
old
men
who
*NL*
could
find
nobody
better
.
And
she
had
often
``
loved
,
''
too
,
*NL*
but
only
so
far
as
the
facts
of
sex
demanded
:
mere
yearnings
*NL*
for
the
masculine
,
to
be
dismissed
for
what
they
were
worth
,
*NL*
with
a
smile
.
Never
before
had
her
personality
been
*NL*
touched
.
She
was
not
young
or
very
rich
,
and
it
amazed
her
*NL*
that
a
man
of
any
standing
should
take
her
seriously
.
As
*NL*
she
sat
trying
to
do
accounts
in
her
empty
house
,
amidst
*NL*
beautiful
pictures
and
noble
books
,
waves
of
emotion
broke
,
*NL*
as
if
a
tide
of
passion
was
flowing
through
the
night
air
.
*NL*
She
shook
her
head
,
tried
to
concentrate
her
attention
,
and
*NL*
failed
.
In
vain
did
she
repeat
:
``
But
I
've
been
through
this
*NL*
sort
of
thing
before
.
''
She
had
never
been
through
it
;
the
*NL*
big
machinery
,
as
opposed
to
the
little
,
had
been
set
in
*NL*
motion
,
and
the
idea
that
Mr.
Wilcox
loved
,
obsessed
her
*NL*
before
she
came
to
love
him
in
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
would
come
to
no
decision
yet
.
``
Oh
,
sir
,
this
is
so
*NL*
sudden
''
--
that
prudish
phrase
exactly
expressed
her
when
her
*NL*
time
came
.
Premonitions
are
not
preparation
.
She
must
*NL*
examine
more
closely
her
own
nature
and
his
;
she
must
talk
*NL*
it
over
judicially
with
Helen
.
It
had
been
a
strange
*NL*
love-scene
--
the
central
radiance
unacknowledged
from
first
*NL*
to
last
.
She
,
in
his
place
,
would
have
said
``
Ich
liebe
*NL*
dich
,
''
but
perhaps
it
was
not
his
habit
to
open
the
heart
.
*NL*
He
might
have
done
it
if
she
had
pressed
him
--
as
a
matter
of
*NL*
duty
,
perhaps
;
England
expects
every
man
to
open
his
heart
*NL*
once
;
but
the
effort
would
have
jarred
him
,
and
never
,
if
*NL*
she
could
avoid
it
,
should
he
lose
those
defences
that
he
*NL*
had
chosen
to
raise
against
the
world
.
He
must
never
be
*NL*
bothered
with
emotional
talk
,
or
with
a
display
of
*NL*
sympathy
.
He
was
an
elderly
man
now
,
and
it
would
be
futile
*NL*
and
impudent
to
correct
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Wilcox
strayed
in
and
out
,
ever
a
welcome
ghost
;
*NL*
surveying
the
scene
,
thought
Margaret
,
without
one
hint
of
*NL*
bitterness
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
19
*NL*
*NL*
If
one
wanted
to
show
a
foreigner
England
,
perhaps
the
*NL*
wisest
course
would
be
to
take
him
to
the
final
section
of
*NL*
the
Purbeck
Hills
,
and
stand
him
on
their
summit
,
a
few
*NL*
miles
to
the
east
of
Corfe
.
Then
system
after
system
of
our
*NL*
island
would
roll
together
under
his
feet
.
Beneath
him
is
*NL*
the
valley
of
the
Frome
,
and
all
the
wild
lands
that
come
*NL*
tossing
down
from
Dorchester
,
black
and
gold
,
to
mirror
*NL*
their
gorse
in
the
expanses
of
Poole
.
The
valley
of
the
*NL*
Stour
is
beyond
,
unaccountable
stream
,
dirty
at
Blandford
,
*NL*
pure
at
Wimborne
--
the
Stour
,
sliding
out
of
fat
fields
,
to
*NL*
marry
the
Avon
beneath
the
tower
of
Christchurch
.
The
*NL*
valley
of
the
Avon
--
invisible
,
but
far
to
the
north
the
*NL*
trained
eye
may
see
Clearbury
Ring
that
guards
it
,
and
the
*NL*
imagination
may
leap
beyond
that
on
to
Salisbury
Plain
*NL*
itself
,
and
beyond
the
Plain
to
all
the
glorious
downs
of
*NL*
Central
England
.
Nor
is
Suburbia
absent
.
Bournemouth
's
*NL*
ignoble
coast
cowers
to
the
right
,
heralding
the
pine-trees
*NL*
that
mean
,
for
all
their
beauty
,
red
houses
,
and
the
Stock
*NL*
Exchange
,
and
extend
to
the
gates
of
London
itself
.
So
*NL*
tremendous
is
the
City
's
trail
!
But
the
cliffs
of
*NL*
Freshwater
it
shall
never
touch
,
and
the
island
will
guard
*NL*
the
Island
's
purity
till
the
end
of
time
.
Seen
from
the
*NL*
west
,
the
Wight
is
beautiful
beyond
all
laws
of
beauty
.
It
*NL*
is
as
if
a
fragment
of
England
floated
forward
to
greet
the
*NL*
foreigner
--
chalk
of
our
chalk
,
turf
of
our
turf
,
epitome
of
*NL*
what
will
follow
.
And
behind
the
fragment
lies
Southampton
,
*NL*
hostess
to
the
nations
,
and
Portsmouth
,
a
latent
fire
,
and
*NL*
all
around
it
,
with
double
and
treble
collision
of
tides
,
*NL*
swirls
the
sea
.
How
many
villages
appear
in
this
view
!
How
*NL*
many
castles
!
How
many
churches
,
vanished
or
triumphant
!
*NL*
How
many
ships
,
railways
,
and
roads
!
What
incredible
*NL*
variety
of
men
working
beneath
that
lucent
sky
to
what
final
*NL*
end
!
The
reason
fails
,
like
a
wave
on
the
Swanage
beach
;
*NL*
the
imagination
swells
,
spreads
,
and
deepens
,
until
it
*NL*
becomes
geographic
and
encircles
England
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
Frieda
Mosebach
,
now
Frau
Architect
Liesecke
,
and
*NL*
mother
to
her
husband
's
baby
,
was
brought
up
to
these
*NL*
heights
to
be
impressed
,
and
,
after
a
prolonged
gaze
,
she
*NL*
said
that
the
hills
were
more
swelling
here
than
in
*NL*
Pomerania
,
which
was
true
,
but
did
not
seem
to
Mrs.
Munt
*NL*
apposite
.
Poole
Harbour
was
dry
,
which
led
her
to
praise
*NL*
the
absence
of
muddy
foreshore
at
Friedrich
Wilhelms
Bad
,
*NL*
Rugen
,
where
beech-trees
hang
over
the
tideless
Baltic
,
and
*NL*
cows
may
contemplate
the
brine
.
Rather
unhealthy
Mrs.
Munt
*NL*
thought
this
would
be
,
water
being
safer
when
it
moved
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
your
English
lakes
--
Vindermere
,
Grasmere
--
are
they
,
*NL*
then
,
unhealthy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Frau
Liesecke
;
but
that
is
because
they
are
fresh
*NL*
water
,
and
different
.
Salt
water
ought
to
have
tides
,
and
*NL*
go
up
and
down
a
great
deal
,
or
else
it
smells
.
Look
,
for
*NL*
instance
,
at
an
aquarium
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
aquarium

Oh

MEESIS
Munt

you
mean
to
tell
me
that

fresh
aquariums
stink
less

salt
?
Why
,
when
Victor
,
my
*NL*
brother-in-law
,
collected
many
tadpoles
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not

''
interrupted
Helen
;
``
at

least
,
you
may
say
it
,
but
you
must
pretend
you
are
being
*NL*
funny

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then

smell

And
the
mud
of
your
Pool
down
there

does
*NL*
it
not
smell

or
may
I
say
`
stink

?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
always
has
been
mud
in
Poole
Harbour
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Munt
,
with
a
slight
frown
.
``
The
rivers
bring
it
down

and
a
*NL*
most
valuable
oyster-fishery
depends
upon
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
is
so
,
''
conceded
Frieda
;
and
another
*NL*
international
incident
was
closed
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Bournemouth
is
,
'
''
resumed
their
hostess
,
quoting
a
*NL*
local
rhyme
to
which
she
was
much
attached
--
''
`
Bournemouth
*NL*
is
,
Poole
was
,
and
Swanage
is
to
be
the
most
important
town
*NL*
of
all
and
biggest
of
the
three
.
'
Now
,
Frau
Liesecke
,
I
have
*NL*
shown
you
Bournemouth
,
and
I
have
shown
you
Poole
,
so
let
us
*NL*
walk
backward
a
little
,
and
look
down
again
at
Swanage
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Aunt
Juley

would
n't
that
be
Meg
's
train
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
tiny
puff
of
smoke
had
been
circling
the
harbour
,
and
*NL*
now
was
bearing
southwards
towards
them
over
the
black
and
*NL*
the
gold
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

Margaret

assented
,
and
in
a
few
minutes
they
had
crossed
*NL*
the
ridge
and
exchanged
the
greater
view
for
the
lesser
.
*NL*
Rather
a
dull
valley
lay
below
,
backed
by
the
slope
of
the
*NL*
coastward
downs
.
They
were
looking
across
the
Isle
of
*NL*
Purbeck
and
on
to
Swanage
,
soon
to
be
the
most
important
*NL*
town
of
all
,
and
ugliest
of
the
three
.
Margaret
's
train
*NL*
reappeared
as
promised
,
and
was
greeted
with
approval
by
her
*NL*
aunt
.
It
came
to
a
standstill
in
the
middle
distance
,
and
*NL*
there
it
had
been
planned
that
Tibby
should
meet
her
,
and
*NL*
drive
her
,
and
a
tea-basket
,
up
to
join
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
''
continued
Helen
to
her
cousin
,
``
the
Wilcoxes
*NL*
collect
houses
as
your
Victor
collects
tadpoles
.
They
have
,
*NL*
one
,
Ducie
Street
;
two
,
Howards
End
,
where
my
great
rumpus
*NL*
was
;
three
,
a
country
seat
in
Shropshire
;
four
,
Charles
has
*NL*
a
house
in
Hilton
;
and
five
,
another
near
Epsom
;
and
six
,
*NL*
Evie
will
have
a
house
when
she
marries
,
and
probably
a
*NL*
pied-a-terre
in
the
country
--
which
makes
seven
.
Oh
yes
,
and
*NL*
Paul
a
hut
in
Africa
makes
eight
.
I
wish
we
could
get
*NL*
Howards
End
.
That
was
something
like
a
dear
little
house
!
*NL*
Did
n't
you
think
so
,
Aunt
Juley
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
I
had
too
much
to
do
,
dear
,
to
look
at
it
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Munt
,
with
a
gracious
dignity
.
``
I
had
everything
to
settle
*NL*
and
explain
,
and
Charles
Wilcox
to
keep
in
his
place
*NL*
besides
.
It
is
n't
likely
I
should
remember
much
.
I
just
*NL*
remember
having
lunch
in
your
bedroom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
so
do
I.
But
,
oh
dear
,
dear
,
how
dead
it
all
*NL*
seems
!
And
in
the
autumn
there
began
this
anti-Pauline
*NL*
movement
--
you
,
and
Frieda
,
and
Meg
,
and
Mrs.
Wilcox
,
all
*NL*
obsessed
with
the
idea
that
I
might
yet
marry
Paul
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
yet
may
,
''
said
Frieda
despondently
.
*NL*
*NL*
Helen
shook
her
head
.
``
The
Great
Wilcox
Peril
will
*NL*
never
return
.
If
I
'm
certain
of
anything
it
's
of
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
is
certain
of
nothing
but
the
truth
of
one
's
own
emotions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
remark
fell
damply
on
the
conversation
.
But
Helen
*NL*
slipped
her
arm
round
her
cousin
,
somehow
liking
her
the
*NL*
better
for
making
it
.
It
was
not
an
original
remark
,
nor
*NL*
had
Frieda
appropriated
it
passionately
,
for
she
had
a
*NL*
patriotic
rather
than
a
philosophic
mind
.
Yet
it
betrayed
*NL*
that
interest
in
the
universal
which
the
average
Teuton
*NL*
possesses
and
the
average
Englishman
does
not
.
It
was
,
*NL*
however
illogically
,
the
good
,
the
beautiful
,
the
true
,
as
*NL*
opposed
to
the
respectable
,
the
pretty
,
the
adequate
.
It
*NL*
was
a
landscape
of
Bocklin
's
beside
a
landscape
of
Leader
's
,
*NL*
strident
and
ill-considered
,
but
quivering
into
supernatural
*NL*
life
.
It
sharpened
idealism
,
stirred
the
soul
.
It
may
have
*NL*
been
a
bad
preparation
for
what
followed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
!
''
cried
Aunt
Juley
,
hurrying
away
from
*NL*
generalities
over
the
narrow
summit
of
the
down
.
``
Stand
*NL*
where
I
stand
,
and
you
will
see
the
pony-cart
coming
.
I
see
*NL*
the
pony-cart
coming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
stood
and
saw
the
pony-cart
coming
.
Margaret
and
*NL*
Tibby
were
presently
seen
coming
in
it
.
Leaving
the
*NL*
outskirts
of
Swanage
,
it
drove
for
a
little
through
the
*NL*
budding
lanes
,
and
then
began
the
ascent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
got
the
house
?
''
they
shouted
,
long
before
she
*NL*
could
possibly
hear
.
*NL*
*NL*
Helen
ran
down
to
meet
her
.
The
highroad
passed
over
a
*NL*
saddle
,
and
a
track
went
thence
at
right
angles
along
the
*NL*
ridge
of
the
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
got
the
house
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
shook
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
what
a
nuisance
!
So
we
're
as
we
were
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
exactly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
got
out
,
looking
tired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
mystery
,
''
said
Tibby
.
``
We
are
to
be
enlightened
presently
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
came
close
up
to
her
and
whispered
that
she
had
*NL*
had
a
proposal
of
marriage
from
Mr.
Wilcox
.
*NL*
*NL*
Helen
was
amused
.
She
opened
the
gate
on
to
the
downs
*NL*
so
that
her
brother
might
lead
the
pony
through
.
``
It
's
just
*NL*
like
a
widower
,
''
she
remarked
.
``
They
've
cheek
enough
for
*NL*
anything
,
and
invariably
select
one
of
their
first
wife
's
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
's
face
flashed
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
type
--
''
She
broke
off
with
a
cry
.
``
Meg
,
not
*NL*
anything
wrong
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
one
minute
,
''
said
Margaret
,
whispering
always
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
've
never
conceivably
--
you
've
never
--
''
She
*NL*
pulled
herself
together
.
``
Tibby
,
hurry
up
through
;
I
ca
n't
*NL*
hold
this
gate
indefinitely
.
Aunt
Juley
!
I
say
,
Aunt
*NL*
Juley
,
make
the
tea
,
will
you
,
and
Frieda
;
we
've
got
to
talk
*NL*
houses
,
and
I
'll
come
on
afterwards
.
''
And
then
,
turning
her
*NL*
face
to
her
sister
's
,
she
burst
into
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
was
stupefied
.
She
heard
herself
saying
,
``
Oh
,
*NL*
really
--
''
She
felt
herself
touched
with
a
hand
that
trembled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
,
''
sobbed
Helen
,
``
do
n't
,
do
n't
,
Meg
,
do
n't
!
''
She
*NL*
seemed
incapable
of
saying
any
other
word
.
Margaret
,
*NL*
trembling
herself
,
led
her
forward
up
the
road
,
till
they
*NL*
strayed
through
another
gate
on
to
the
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
,
do
n't
do
such
a
thing
!
I
tell
you
not
*NL*
to
--
do
n't
!
I
know
--
do
n't
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Panic
and
emptiness
,
''
sobbed
Helen
.
``
Do
n't
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Margaret
thought
,
``
Helen
is
a
little
selfish
.
I
*NL*
have
never
behaved
like
this
when
there
has
seemed
a
chance
*NL*
of
her
marrying
.
She
said
:
``
But
we
would
still
see
each
*NL*
other
very
often
,
and
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
a
thing
like
that
,
''
sobbed
Helen
.
And
she
*NL*
broke
right
away
and
wandered
distractedly
upwards
,
*NL*
stretching
her
hands
towards
the
view
and
crying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
happened
to
you
?
''
called
Margaret
,
following
*NL*
through
the
wind
that
gathers
at
sundown
on
the
northern
*NL*
slopes
of
hills
.
``
But
it
's
stupid
!
''
And
suddenly
stupidity
*NL*
seized
her
,
and
the
immense
landscape
was
blurred
.
But
*NL*
Helen
turned
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
Meg
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
's
happened
to
either
of
us
,
''
said
*NL*
Margaret
,
wiping
her
eyes
.
``
We
must
both
have
gone
mad
.
''
*NL*
Then
Helen
wiped
hers
,
and
they
even
laughed
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
,
sit
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
;
I
'll
sit
down
if
you
'll
sit
down

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There

-LRB-
One
kiss

-RRB-
Now
,
whatever
,
whatever
is
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
mean
what
I
said
.
Do
n't
;
it
would
n't
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Helen
,
stop
saying
`
do
n't
'
!
It
's
ignorant
.
It
's
*NL*
as
if
your
head
was
n't
out
of
the
slime
.
`
Do
n't
'
is
*NL*
probably
what
Mrs.
Bast
says
all
the
day
to
Mr.
Bast
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Helen
was
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
about
it
first
,
and
meanwhile
perhaps
I
'll
have
*NL*
got
my
head
out
of
the
slime
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
better
.
Well
,
where
shall
I
begin
?
When
I
*NL*
arrived
at
Waterloo
--
no
,
I
'll
go
back
before
that
,
because
*NL*
I
'm
anxious
you
should
know
everything
from
the
first
.
The
*NL*
`
first
'
was
about
ten
days
ago
.
It
was
the
day
Mr.
Bast
*NL*
came
to
tea
and
lost
his
temper
.
I
was
defending
him
,
and
*NL*
Mr.
Wilcox
became
jealous
about
me
,
however
slightly
.
I
*NL*
thought
it
was
the
involuntary
thing
,
which
men
ca
n't
help
*NL*
any
more
than
we
can
.
You
know
--
at
least
,
I
know
in
my
own
*NL*
case
--
when
a
man
has
said
to
me
,
`
So-and-so
's
a
pretty
*NL*
girl
,
'
I
am
seized
with
a
momentary
sourness
against
*NL*
So-and-so
,
and
long
to
tweak
her
ear
.
It
's
a
tiresome
*NL*
feeling
,
but
not
an
important
one
,
and
one
easily
manages
*NL*
it
.
But
it
was
n't
only
this
in
Mr.
Wilcox
's
case
,
I
gather
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
love
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
considered
.
``
It
is
wonderful
knowing
that
a
*NL*
real
man
cares
for
you
,
''
she
said
.
``
The
mere
fact
of
that
*NL*
grows
more
tremendous
.
Remember
,
I
've
known
and
liked
him
*NL*
steadily
for
nearly
three
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
loved
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
peered
into
her
past
.
It
is
pleasant
to
*NL*
analyze
feelings
while
they
are
still
only
feelings
,
and
*NL*
unembodied
in
the
social
fabric
.
With
her
arm
round
Helen
,
*NL*
and
her
eyes
shifting
over
the
view
,
as
if
this
county
or
*NL*
that
could
reveal
the
secret
of
her
own
heart
,
she
meditated
*NL*
honestly
,
and
said
,
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
will
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Margaret
,
``
of
that
I
'm
pretty
sure

Indeed
,
*NL*
I
began
the
moment
he
spoke
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
have
settled
to
marry
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
,
but
am
wanting
a
long
talk
about
it
now
.
What
*NL*
is
it
against
him
,
Helen
?
You
must
try
and
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Helen
,
in
her
turn
,
looked
outwards
.
``
It
is
ever
since
*NL*
Paul
,
''
she
said
finally
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
has
Mr.
Wilcox
to
do
with
Paul
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
he
was
there
,
they
were
all
there
that
morning
when
*NL*
I
came
down
to
breakfast
,
and
saw
that
Paul
was
*NL*
frightened
--
the
man
who
loved
me
frightened
and
all
his
*NL*
paraphernalia
fallen
,
so
that
I
knew
it
was
impossible
,
*NL*
because
personal
relations
are
the
important
thing
for
ever
*NL*
and
ever
,
and
not
this
outer
life
of
telegrams
and
anger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
poured
the
sentence
forth
in
one
breath
,
but
her
*NL*
sister
understood
it
,
because
it
touched
on
thoughts
that
*NL*
were
familiar
between
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
foolish
.
In
the
first
place
,
I
disagree
about
*NL*
the
outer
life
.
Well
,
we
've
often
argued
that
.
The
real
*NL*
point
is
that
there
is
the
widest
gulf
between
my
*NL*
love-making
and
yours
.
Yours
--
was
romance
;
mine
will
be
*NL*
prose
.
I
'm
not
running
it
down
--
a
very
good
kind
of
prose
,
*NL*
but
well
considered
,
well
thought
out
.
For
instance
,
I
know
*NL*
all
Mr.
Wilcox
's
faults
.
He
's
afraid
of
emotion
.
He
cares
*NL*
too
much
about
success
,
too
little
about
the
past
.
His
*NL*
sympathy
lacks
poetry
,
and
so
is
n't
sympathy
really
.
I
'd
*NL*
even
say
''
--
she
looked
at
the
shining
lagoons
--
``
that
,
*NL*
spiritually
,
he
's
not
as
honest
as
I
am
.
Does
n't
that
*NL*
satisfy
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
does
n't
,
''
said
Helen
.
``
It
makes
me
feel
worse
*NL*
and
worse
.
You
must
be
mad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
made
a
movement
of
irritation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
intend
him
,
or
any
man
or
any
woman
,
to
be
all
*NL*
my
life
--
good
heavens
,
no
!
There
are
heaps
of
things
in
me
*NL*
that
he
does
n't
,
and
shall
never
,
understand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
she
spoke
before
the
wedding
ceremony
and
the
*NL*
physical
union
,
before
the
astonishing
glass
shade
had
*NL*
fallen
that
interposes
between
married
couples
and
the
*NL*
world
.
She
was
to
keep
her
independence
more
than
do
most
*NL*
women
as
yet
.
Marriage
was
to
alter
her
fortunes
rather
*NL*
than
her
character
,
and
she
was
not
far
wrong
in
boasting
*NL*
that
she
understood
her
future
husband
.
Yet
he
did
alter
*NL*
her
character
--
a
little
.
There
was
an
unforeseen
surprise
,
*NL*
a
cessation
of
the
winds
and
odours
of
life
,
a
social
*NL*
pressure
that
would
have
her
think
conjugally
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
with
him
,
''
she
continued
.
``
There
are
heaps
of
*NL*
things
in
him
--
more
especially
things
that
he
does
--
that
*NL*
will
always
be
hidden
from
me
.
He
has
all
those
public
*NL*
qualities
which
you
so
despise
and

She
*NL*
waved
her
hand
at
the
landscape

which
confirmed
anything

*NL*
``
If

No

There
was
a
long
silence
,
during
which
the
tide
returned
*NL*
into
Poole
Harbour
.
``
One
would
lose
something

murmured
*NL*
Helen
,
apparently
to
herself
.
The
water
crept
over
the
*NL*
mud-flats
towards
the
gorse
and
the
blackened
heather
.
*NL*
Branksea
Island
lost
its
immense
foreshores
,
and
became
a
*NL*
sombre
episode
of
trees
.
Frome
was
forced
inward
towards
*NL*
Dorchester
,
Stour
against
Wimborne
,
Avon
towards
Salisbury
,
*NL*
and
over
the
immense
displacement
the
sun
presided
,
leading
*NL*
it
to
triumph
ere
he
sank
to
rest
.
England
was
alive
,
*NL*
throbbing
through
all
her
estuaries
,
crying
for
joy
through
*NL*
the
mouths
of
all
her
gulls
,
and
the
north
wind
,
with
*NL*
contrary
motion
,
blew
stronger
against
her
rising
seas
.
*NL*
What
did
it
mean
?
For
what
end
are
her
fair
complexities
,
*NL*
her
changes
of
soil
,
her
sinuous
coast
?
Does
she
belong
to
*NL*
those
who
have
moulded
her
and
made
her
feared
by
other

lands
,
or
to
those
who
have
added
nothing
to
her
power

but
*NL*
have
somehow
seen
her

seen
the
whole
island
at
once

lying

as

jewel
in

silver
sea

sailing

Chapter
20
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
had
often
wondered
at
the
disturbance
that
takes
*NL*
place
in
the
world
's
waters
,
when
Love
,
who
seems
so
tiny
a
*NL*
pebble
,
slips
in
.
Whom
does
Love
concern
beyond
the
beloved
*NL*
and
the
lover
?
Yet
his
impact
deluges
a
hundred
shores
.
No
*NL*
doubt
the
disturbance
is
really
the
spirit
of
the
*NL*
generations
,
welcoming
the
new
generation
,
and
chafing
*NL*
against
the
ultimate
Fate
,
who
holds
all
the
seas
in
the
*NL*
palm
of
her
hand
.
But
Love
can
not
understand
this
.
He
*NL*
can
not
comprehend
another
's
infinity
;
he
is
conscious
only
*NL*
of
his
own
--
flying
sunbeam
,
falling
rose
,
pebble
that
asks
*NL*
for
one
quiet
plunge
below
the
fretting
interplay
of
space
*NL*
and
time
.
He
knows
that
he
will
survive
at
the
end
of
*NL*
things
,
and
be
gathered
by
Fate
as
a
jewel
from
the
slime
,
*NL*
and
be
handed
with
admiration
round
the
assembly
of
the
*NL*
gods
.
``
Men
did
produce
this
,
''
they
will
say
,
and
,
saying
,
*NL*
they
will
give
men
immortality
.
But
meanwhile
--
what
*NL*
agitations
meanwhile
!
The
foundations
of
Property
and
*NL*
Propriety
are
laid
bare
,
twin
rocks
;
Family
Pride
flounders
*NL*
to
the
surface
,
puffing
and
blowing
,
and
refusing
to
be
*NL*
comforted
;
Theology
,
vaguely
ascetic
,
gets
up
a
nasty
ground
*NL*
swell
.
Then
the
lawyers
are
aroused
--
cold
brood
--
and
creep
*NL*
out
of
their
holes
.
They
do
what
they
can
;
they
tidy
up
*NL*
Property
and
Propriety
,
reassure
Theology
and
Family
Pride
.
*NL*
Half-guineas
are
poured
on
the
troubled
waters
,
the
lawyers
*NL*
creep
back
,
and
,
if
all
has
gone
well
,
Love
joins
one
man
*NL*
and
woman
together
in
Matrimony
.
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
had
expected
the
disturbance
,
and
was
not
*NL*
irritated
by
it
.
For
a
sensitive
woman
she
had
steady
*NL*
nerves
,
and
could
bear
with
the
incongruous
and
the
*NL*
grotesque
;
and
,
besides
,
there
was
nothing
excessive
about
*NL*
her
love-affair
.
Good-humour
was
the
dominant
note
of
her
*NL*
relations
with
Mr.
Wilcox
,
or
,
as
I
must
now
call
him
,
*NL*
Henry
.
Henry
did
not
encourage
romance
,
and
she
was
no
girl
*NL*
to
fidget
for
it
.
An
acquaintance
had
become
a
lover
,
might
*NL*
become
a
husband
,
but
would
retain
all
that
she
had
noted
in
*NL*
the
acquaintance
;
and
love
must
confirm
an
old
relation
*NL*
rather
than
reveal
a
new
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
spirit
she
promised
to
marry
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
in
Swanage
on
the
morrow
,
bearing
the
*NL*
engagement-ring
.
They
greeted
one
another
with
a
hearty
*NL*
cordiality
that
impressed
Aunt
Juley
.
Henry
dined
at
The
*NL*
Bays
,
but
he
had
engaged
a
bedroom
in
the
principal
hotel
:
*NL*
he
was
one
of
those
men
who
knew
the
principal
hotel
by
*NL*
instinct
.
After
dinner
he
asked
Margaret
if
she
would
n't
*NL*
care
for
a
turn
on
the
Parade
.
She
accepted
,
and
could
not
*NL*
repress
a
little
tremor
;
it
would
be
her
first
real
love
*NL*
scene
.
But
as
she
put
on
her
hat
she
burst
out
laughing
.
*NL*
Love
was
so
unlike
the
article
served
up
in
books
:
the
joy
,
*NL*
though
genuine
,
was
different
;
the
mystery
an
unexpected
*NL*
mystery
.
For
one
thing
,
Mr.
Wilcox
still
seemed
a
stranger
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
time
they
talked
about
the
ring
;
then
she
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
remember
the
Embankment
at
Chelsea
?
It
ca
n't
be
*NL*
ten
days
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
said
,
laughing
.
``
And
you
and
your
sister
were
*NL*
head
and
ears
deep
in
some
Quixotic
scheme
.
Ah
well
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
little
thought
then
,
certainly
.
Did
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
about
that
;
I
should
n't
like
to
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
was
it
earlier
?
''
she
cried
.
``
Did
you
think
of
me
*NL*
this
way
earlier
!
How
extraordinarily
interesting
,
Henry
!
*NL*
Tell
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Henry
had
no
intention
of
telling
.
Perhaps
he
could
*NL*
not
have
told
,
for
his
mental
states
became
obscure
as
soon
*NL*
as
he
had
passed
through
them
.
He
misliked
the
very
word
*NL*
``
interesting
,
''
connoting
it
with
wasted
energy
and
even
with
*NL*
morbidity
.
Hard
facts
were
enough
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
think
of
it
,
''
she
pursued
.
``
No
;
when
you
*NL*
spoke
to
me
in
the
drawing-room
,
that
was
practically
the
*NL*
first
.
It
was
all
so
different
from
what
it
's
supposed
to
*NL*
be
.
On
the
stage
,
or
in
books
,
a
proposal
is
--
how
shall
I
*NL*
put
it
?
--
a
full-blown
affair
,
a
kind
of
bouquet
;
it
loses
*NL*
its
literal
meaning
.
But
in
life
a
proposal
really
is
a
proposal
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
way
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
--
a
suggestion
,
a
seed
,
''
she
concluded
;
and
the
thought
*NL*
flew
away
into
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
thinking
,
if
you
did
n't
mind
,
that
we
ought
to
*NL*
spend
this
evening
in
a
business
talk
;
there
will
be
so
much
*NL*
to
settle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
so
too

Tell
me

first
place

*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

well

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
so
glad

she
answered
,
a
little
surprised
.
``

*NL*
did
you
talk
about

Me

presumably

*NL*
*NL*
``

``

She
said
more
gravely

``
Your

always
hit
it
off

he
said
*NL*
negligently
.
``
But
we
're
drifting
away
from
our
business

*NL*
Let
me
begin
at
the
beginning
.
You
know
that
Evie
is
going
*NL*
to
marry
Percy
Cahill

*NL*
*NL*
``
Dolly

good

he
demands
--

rightly

a
suitable

provision
with
her
.
And
in
the
second
place
,
you
will
*NL*
naturally
understand
,
there
is
Charles

Before
leaving

town
,
I
wrote
Charles
a
very
careful
letter

You
see
,
he

has
an
increasing
family

increasing
expenses

the
I.

development

looking
out
to

not
understanding

of
,
running
about
at
the
back
of
her
brain
,
that
*NL*
poverty
is
somehow
`
real
.
'
She
dislikes
all
organization
,
*NL*
and
probably
confuses
wealth
with
the
technique
of
wealth
.
*NL*
Sovereigns
in
a
stocking
would
n't
bother
her
;
cheques
do
.
*NL*
Helen
is
too
relentless
.
One
ca
n't
deal
in
her
high-handed
*NL*
manner
with
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
this
other
point
,
and
then
I
must
go
back
to
my
*NL*
hotel
and
write
some
letters
.
What
's
to
be
done
now
about
*NL*
the
house
in
Ducie
Street
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Keep
it
on

at
least
,
it
depends

When
do
you
want
to
*NL*
marry
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
raised
her
voice
,
as
too
often
,
and
some
youths
,
who
*NL*
were
also
taking
the
evening
air
,
overheard
her
.
``
Getting
a
*NL*
bit
hot
,
eh
?
''
said
one
.
Mr.
Wilcox
turned
on
them
,
and
said
*NL*
sharply
,
``
I
say
!
''
There
was
silence
.
``
Take
care
I
do
n't
*NL*
report
you
to
the
police
.
''
They
moved
away
quietly
enough
,
*NL*
but
were
only
biding
their
time
,
and
the
rest
of
the
*NL*
conversation
was
punctuated
by
peals
of
ungovernable
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lowering
his
voice
and
infusing
a
hint
of
reproof
into
*NL*
it
,
he
said
:
``
Evie
will
probably
be
married
in
September
.
*NL*
We
could
scarcely
think
of
anything
before
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
earlier
the
nicer
,
Henry
.
Females
are
not
supposed
*NL*
to
say
such
things
,
but
the
earlier
the
nicer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
about
September
for
us
too
?
''
he
asked
,
rather
dryly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Right
.
Shall
we
go
into
Ducie
Street
ourselves
in
*NL*
September
?
Or
shall
we
try
to
bounce
Helen
and
Tibby
into
*NL*
it
?
That
's
rather
an
idea
.
They
are
so
unbusinesslike
,
we
*NL*
could
make
them
do
anything
by
judicious
management
.
Look
*NL*
here
--
yes
.
We
'll
do
that
.
And
we
ourselves
could
live
at
*NL*
Howards
End
or
Shropshire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
blew
out
his
cheeks
.
``
Heavens
!
how
you
women
do
fly
*NL*
round
!
My
head
's
in
a
whirl
.
Point
by
point
,
Margaret
.
*NL*
Howards
End
's
impossible
.
I
let
it
to
Hamar
Bryce
on
a
*NL*
three
years
'
agreement
last
March
.
Do
n't
you
remember
?
*NL*
Oniton
.
Well
,
that
is
much
,
much
too
far
away
to
rely
on
*NL*
entirely
.
You
will
be
able
to
be
down
there
entertaining
a
*NL*
certain
amount
,
but
we
must
have
a
house
within
easy
reach
*NL*
of
Town
.
Only
Ducie
Street
has
huge
drawbacks
.
There
's
a
*NL*
mews
behind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
could
not
help
laughing
.
It
was
the
first
she
*NL*
had
heard
of
the
mews
behind
Ducie
Street
.
When
she
was
a
*NL*
possible
tenant
it
had
suppressed
itself
,
not
consciously
,
*NL*
but
automatically
.
The
breezy
Wilcox
manner
,
though
*NL*
genuine
,
lacked
the
clearness
of
vision
that
is
imperative
*NL*
for
truth
.
When
Henry
lived
in
Ducie
Street
he
remembered
*NL*
the
mews
;
when
he
tried
to
let
he
forgot
it
;
and
if
anyone
*NL*
had
remarked
that
the
mews
must
be
either
there
or
not
,
he
*NL*
would
have
felt
annoyed
,
and
afterwards
have
found
some
*NL*
opportunity
of
stigmatizing
the
speaker
as
academic
.
So
*NL*
does
my
grocer
stigmatize
me
when
I
complain
of
the
quality
*NL*
of
his
sultanas
,
and
he
answers
in
one
breath
that
they
are
*NL*
the
best
sultanas
,
and
how
can
I
expect
the
best
sultanas
at
*NL*
that
price
?
It
is
a
flaw
inherent
in
the
business
mind
,
and
*NL*
Margaret
may
do
well
to
be
tender
to
it
,
considering
all
*NL*
that
the
business
mind
has
done
for
England
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
in
summer
especially
,
the
mews
is
a
serious
*NL*
nuisance
.
The
smoking
room
,
too
,
is
an
abominable
little
*NL*
den
.
The
house
opposite
has
been
taken
by
operatic
people
.
*NL*
Ducie
Street
's
going
down
,
it
's
my
private
opinion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
sad

It
's
only
a

``

observed
Mr.

,
omitting
to
add
that
they
were
also
the
*NL*
men
to
whom
he
gave
work
as
clerks

work
that
scarcely
*NL*
encouraged
them
to
grow
into

their

get
on

*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
as
he
spoke
,
and
prepared
to
see
her
back
to
*NL*
The
Bays
.
The
business
was
over
.
His
hotel
was
in
the
*NL*
opposite
direction
,
and
if
he
accompanied
her
his
letters
*NL*
would
be
late
for
the
post
.
She
implored
him
not
to
come
,
*NL*
but
he
was
obdurate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
nice
beginning
,

your
aunt
saw
you
slip
in
alone
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
always
do

it

common
sense

You
will
make

me
so
angry

I
do

the
least
take
it
as
a
compliment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
laughed
,
and
lit
a
cigar
.
``
It
is
n't
meant
as
a
*NL*
compliment

my

I
just
wo

going
about

the

It

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ca

look
after
myself

I
do
wish
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
along

Margaret
;
no
wheedling

''
*NL*
*NL*
A
younger
woman
might
have
resented
his
masterly
ways
,
*NL*
but
Margaret
had
too
firm
a
grip
of
life
to
make
a
fuss
.
*NL*
She
was
,
in
her
own
way
,
as
masterly
.
If
he
was
a
fortress
*NL*
she
was
a
mountain
peak
,
whom
all
might
tread
,
but
whom
the
*NL*
snows
made
nightly
virginal
.
Disdaining
the
heroic
outfit
,
*NL*
excitable
in
her
methods
,
garrulous
,
episodical
,
shrill
,
she
*NL*
misled
her
lover
much
as
she
had
misled
her
aunt
.
He
*NL*
mistook
her
fertility
for
weakness
.
He
supposed
her
``
as
*NL*
clever
as
they
make
'em
,
''
but
no
more
,
not
realizing
that
*NL*
she
was
penetrating
to
the
depths
of
his
soul
,
and
approving
*NL*
of
what
she
found
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
if
insight
were
sufficient
,
if
the
inner
life
were
*NL*
the
whole
of
life
,
their
happiness
has
been
assured
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
walked
ahead
briskly
.
The
parade
and
the
road
*NL*
after
it
were
well
lighted
,
but
it
was
darker
in
Aunt
*NL*
Juley
's
garden
.
As
they
were
going
up
by
the
side-paths
,
*NL*
through
some
rhododendrons
,
Mr.
Wilcox
,
who
was
in
front
,
*NL*
said
``
Margaret
''
rather
huskily
,
turned
,
dropped
his
cigar
,
*NL*
and
took
her
in
his
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
startled
,
and
nearly
screamed
,
but
recovered
*NL*
herself
at
once
,
and
kissed
with
genuine
love
the
lips
that
*NL*
were
pressed
against
her
own
.
It
was
their
first
kiss
,
and
*NL*
when
it
was
over
he
saw
her
safely
to
the
door
and
rang
the
*NL*
bell
for
her
,
but
disappeared
into
the
night
before
the
maid
*NL*
answered
it
.
On
looking
back
,
the
incident
displeased
her
.
*NL*
It
was
so
isolated
.
Nothing
in
their
previous
conversation
*NL*
had
heralded
it
,
and
,
worse
still
,
no
tenderness
had
*NL*
ensued
.
If
a
man
can
not
lead
up
to
passion
he
can
at
all
*NL*
events
lead
down
from
it
,
and
she
had
hoped
,
after
her
*NL*
complaisance
,
for
some
interchange
of
gentle
words
.
But
he
*NL*
had
hurried
away
as
if
ashamed
,
and
for
an
instant
she
was
*NL*
reminded
of
Helen
and
Paul
.

Chapter

*NL*
Margaret
greeted
her
lord
with
peculiar
tenderness
on
the
*NL*
morrow
.
Mature
as
he
was
,
she
might
yet
be
able
to
help
him
*NL*
to
the
building
of
the
rainbow
bridge
that
should
connect
*NL*
the
prose
in
us
with
the
passion
.
Without
it
we
are
*NL*
meaningless
fragments
,
half
monks
,
half
beasts
,
unconnected
*NL*
arches
that
have
never
joined
into
a
man
.
With
it
love
is
*NL*
born
,
and
alights
on
the
highest
curve
,
glowing
against
the
*NL*
grey
,
sober
against
the
fire
.
Happy
the
man
who
sees
from
*NL*
either
aspect
the
glory
of
these
outspread
wings
.
The
roads
*NL*
of
his
soul
lie
clear
,
and
he
and
his
friends
shall
find
easy-going
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
hard-going
in
the
roads
of
Mr.
Wilcox
's
soul
.
*NL*
From
boyhood
he
had
neglected
them
.
``
I
am
not
a
fellow
who
*NL*
bothers
about
my
own
inside
.
''
Outwardly
he
was
cheerful
,
*NL*
reliable
,
and
brave
;
but
within
,
all
had
reverted
to
chaos
,
*NL*
ruled
,
so
far
as
it
was
ruled
at
all
,
by
an
incomplete
*NL*
asceticism
.
Whether
as
boy
,
husband
,
or
widower
,
he
had
*NL*
always
the
sneaking
belief
that
bodily
passion
is
bad
,
a
*NL*
belief
that
is
desirable
only
when
held
passionately
.
*NL*
Religion
had
confirmed
him
.
The
words
that
were
read
aloud
*NL*
on
Sunday
to
him
and
to
other
respectable
men
were
the
words
*NL*
that
had
once
kindled
the
souls
of
St.
Catharine
and
St.
*NL*
Francis
into
a
white-hot
hatred
of
the
carnal
.
He
could-not
*NL*
be
as
the
saints
and
love
the
Infinite
with
a
seraphic
*NL*
ardour
,
but
he
could
be
a
little
ashamed
of
loving
a
wife
.
*NL*
``
Amabat
,

''
And
it
was
here
that
Margaret
*NL*
hoped
to
help
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
did
not
seem
so
difficult
.
She
need
trouble
him
with
*NL*
no
gift
of
her
own
.
She
would
only
point
out
the
salvation
*NL*
that
was
latent
in
his
own
soul
,
and
in
the
soul
of
every
*NL*
man
.
Only
connect
!
That
was
the
whole
of
her
sermon
.
Only
*NL*
connect
the
prose
and
the
passion
,
and
both
will
be
exalted
,
*NL*
and
human
love
will
be
seen
at
its
height
.
Live
in
*NL*
fragments
no
longer
.
Only
connect
,
and
the
beast
and
the
*NL*
monk
,
robbed
of
the
isolation
that
is
life
to
either
,
will
die
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nor
was
the
message
difficult
to
give
.
It
need
not
take
*NL*
the
form
of
a
good
``
talking
.
''
By
quiet
indications
the
*NL*
bridge
would
be
built
and
span
their
lives
with
beauty
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
failed
.
For
there
was
one
quality
in
Henry
for
*NL*
which
she
was
never
prepared
,
however
much
she
reminded
*NL*
herself
of
it
:
his
obtuseness
.
He
simply
did
not
notice
*NL*
things
,
and
there
was
no
more
to
be
said
.
He
never
noticed
*NL*
that
Helen
and
Frieda
were
hostile
,
or
that
Tibby
was
not
*NL*
interested
in
currant
plantations
;
he
never
noticed
the
*NL*
lights
and
shades
that
exist
in
the
grayest
conversation
,
*NL*
the
finger-posts
,
the
milestones
,
the
collisions
,
the
*NL*
illimitable
views
.
Once
--
on
another
occasion
--
she
scolded
*NL*
him
about
it
.
He
was
puzzled
,
but
replied
with
a
laugh
:
``
My
*NL*
motto
is
Concentrate
.
I
've
no
intention
of
frittering
away
*NL*
my
strength
on
that
sort
of
thing
.
''
``
It
is
n't
frittering
*NL*
away
the
strength
,
''
she
protested
.
``
It
's
enlarging
the
*NL*
space
in
which
you
may
be
strong
.
''
He
answered
:
``
You
're
a
*NL*
clever
little
woman
,
but
my
motto
's
Concentrate
.
''
And
this
*NL*
morning
he
concentrated
with
a
vengeance
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
met
in
the
rhododendrons
of
yesterday
.
In
the
*NL*
daylight
the
bushes
were
inconsiderable
and
the
path
was
*NL*
bright
in
the
morning
sun
.
She
was
with
Helen
,
who
had
been
*NL*
ominously
quiet
since
the
affair
was
settled
.
``
Here
we
all
*NL*
are
!

she
cried
,
and
took
him
by
one
hand
,
retaining
her
*NL*
sister
's
in
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
we
are

Good-morning

*NL*
*NL*
Helen
replied
,
``

*NL*
``

Helen
had
dropped
her
hand
now
,
and
he
had
steered
her
*NL*
past
the
whole
party
to
the
seaward
side
of
the
house

*NL*
Beneath
them
was
the
bourgeois
little
bay
,
which
must
have

yearned
all
through
the
centuries
for
just
such
a
*NL*
watering-place
as
Swanage
to
be
built
on
its
margin
.
The
*NL*
waves
were
colourless
,
and
the
Bournemouth
steamer
gave
a
*NL*
further
touch
of
insipidity

drawn
up
against

hooting
wildly
for

Her

a

sharply
what

wanted

his
*NL*
voice
grew
complacent
;
it
always
did
when
he
eliminated
the
*NL*
personal

always
will
be
rich

*NL*
It
was
no
good
instructing
the

was
going
to

talk
about
God
in
that
neurotic
modern
way

Fraternal
to
*NL*
the
last

he
left
her
for
the
quieter
company
of
Mrs.

He
thought
,
``
She
rather
reminds

looked
out
at

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do

advised
her

It
'll
only
end
in
a
cry

*NL*
``

said
Helen
slowly
.
``
I
do
n't
like

They
are
scientific
themselves

talk
of
the

of
the
fittest

and
cut
down
the
salaries

their

clerks

stunt
the
independence
of
all
who
may
menace

their
comfort

yet
they
believe
that
somehow
good

and
*NL*
it
is
always
that
sloppy

somehow

will
be
the
outcome
,
and
*NL*
that
in
some
mystical
way
the
Mr.

biting
her

She
shook
off
*NL*
her
sister
's
hand
and
went
into
the
house
.
Margaret
,
*NL*
distressed
at
the
day
's
beginning
,
followed
the
Bournemouth
*NL*
steamer
with
her
eyes
.
She
saw
that
Helen
's
nerves
were
*NL*
exasperated
by
the
unlucky
Bast
business
beyond
the
bounds
*NL*
of
politeness
.
There
might
at
any
minute
be
a
real

explosion

which
even
Henry
would
notice

be
removed

rejoined
her
with
,
``
Good

I
did
the
breaking

of

*NL*
*NL*
A
wave
of
tenderness
came
over
her
.
She
put
a
hand
on
*NL*
either
shoulder
,
and
looked
deeply
into
the
black
,
bright
*NL*
eyes
.
What
was
behind
their
competent

She
knew
,
but
*NL*
was
not
disquieted

*NL*
Chapter
23
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
had
no
intention
of
letting
things
slide
,
and
the
*NL*
evening
before
she
left
Swanage
she
gave
her
sister
a
*NL*
thorough
scolding
.
She
censured
her
,
not
for
disapproving
*NL*
of
the
engagement
,
but
for
throwing
over
her
disapproval
a
*NL*
veil
of
mystery
.
Helen
was
equally
frank
.
``
Yes
,
''
she
said
,
*NL*
with
the
air
of
one
looking
inwards
,
``
there
is
a
mystery
.
I
*NL*
ca
n't
help
it
.
It
's
not
my
fault
.
It
's
the
way
life
has
*NL*
been
made
.
''
Helen
in
those
days
was
over-interested
in
the
*NL*
subconscious
self
.
She
exaggerated
the
Punch
and
Judy
*NL*
aspect
of
life
,
and
spoke
of
mankind
as
puppets
,
whom
an
*NL*
invisible
showman
twitches
into
love
and
war
.
Margaret
*NL*
pointed
out
that
if
she
dwelt
on
this
she
,
too
,
would
*NL*
eliminate
the
personal
.
Helen
was
silent
for
a
minute
,
and
*NL*
then
burst
into
a
queer
speech
,
which
cleared
the
air
.
``
Go
*NL*
on
and
marry
him
.
I
think
you
're
splendid
;
and
if
anyone
*NL*
can
pull
it
off
,
you
will
.
''
Margaret
denied
that
there
was
*NL*
anything
to
``
pull
off
,
''
but
she
continued
:
``
Yes
,
there
is
,
*NL*
and
I
was
n't
up
to
it
with
Paul
.
I
can
only
do
what
's
*NL*
easy
.
I
can
only
entice
and
be
enticed
.
I
ca
n't
,
and
wo
n't
*NL*
attempt
difficult
relations
.
If
I
marry
,
it
will
either
be
*NL*
a
man
who
's
strong
enough
to
boss
me
or
whom
I
'm
strong
*NL*
enough
to
boss
.
So
I
sha
n't
ever
marry
,
for
there
are
n't
*NL*
such
men
.
And
Heaven
help
any
one
whom
I
do
marry
,
for
I
*NL*
shall
certainly
run
away
from
him
before
you
can
say
`
Jack
*NL*
Robinson
.
'
There
!
Because
I
'm
uneducated
.
But
you
,
you
're
*NL*
different
;
you
're
a
heroine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Helen
!
Am
I
?
Will
it
be
as
dreadful
for
poor
*NL*
Henry
as
all
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
to
keep
proportion
,
and
that
's
heroic
,
it
's
*NL*
Greek
,
and
I
do
n't
see
why
it
should
n't
succeed
with
you
.
*NL*
Go
on
and
fight
with
him
and
help
him
.
Do
n't
ask
ME
for
*NL*
help
,
or
even
for
sympathy
.
Henceforward
I
'm
going
my
own
*NL*
way
.
I
mean
to
be
thorough
,
because
thoroughness
is
easy
.
*NL*
I
mean
to
dislike
your
husband
,
and
to
tell
him
so
.
I
mean
*NL*
to
make
no
concessions
to
Tibby
.
If
Tibby
wants
to
live
*NL*
with
me
,
he
must
lump
me
.
I
mean
to
love
YOU
more
than
*NL*
ever
.
Yes
,
I
do
.
You
and
I
have
built
up
something
real
,
*NL*
because
it
is
purely
spiritual
.
There
's
no
veil
of
mystery
*NL*
over
us
.
Unreality
and
mystery
begin
as
soon
as
one
touches
*NL*
the
body
.
The
popular
view
is
,
as
usual
,
exactly
the
wrong
*NL*
one
.
Our
bothers
are
over
tangible
things
--
money
,
husbands
,
*NL*
house-hunting
.
But
Heaven
will
work
of
itself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
was
grateful
for
this
expression
of
affection
,
*NL*
and
answered
,
``
Perhaps
.
''
All
vistas
close
in
the
unseen
--
no
*NL*
one
doubts
it
--
but
Helen
closed
them
rather
too
quickly
for
*NL*
her
taste
.
At
every
turn
of
speech
one
was
confronted
with
*NL*
reality
and
the
absolute
.
Perhaps
Margaret
grew
too
old
for
*NL*
metaphysics
,
perhaps
Henry
was
weaning
her
from
them
,
but
*NL*
she
felt
that
there
was
something
a
little
unbalanced
in
the
*NL*
mind
that
so
readily
shreds
the
visible
.
The
business
man
*NL*
who
assumes
that
this
life
is
everything
,
and
the
mystic
who
*NL*
asserts
that
it
is
nothing
,
fail
,
on
this
side
and
on
that
,
*NL*
to
hit
the
truth
.
``
Yes
,
I
see
,
dear
;
it
's
about
halfway
*NL*
between
,
''
Aunt
Juley
had
hazarded
in
earlier
years
.
No
;
*NL*
truth
,
being
alive
,
was
not
halfway
between
anything
.
It
*NL*
was
only
to
be
found
by
continuous
excursions
into
either
*NL*
realm
,
and
though
proportion
is
the
final
secret
,
to
espouse
*NL*
it
at
the
outset
is
to
insure
sterility
.
*NL*
*NL*
Helen
,
agreeing
here
,
disagreeing
there
,
would
have
*NL*
talked
till
midnight
,
but
Margaret
,
with
her
packing
to
do
,
*NL*
focussed
the
conversation
on
Henry
.
She
might
abuse
Henry
*NL*
behind
his
back
,
but
please
would
she
always
,
be
civil
to
*NL*
him
in
company
?
``
I
definitely
dislike
him
,
but
I
'll
do
what
*NL*
I
can
,
''
promised
Helen
.
``
Do
what
you
can
with
my
friends
in
*NL*
return
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
conversation
made
Margaret
easier
.
Their
inner
*NL*
life
was
so
safe
that
they
could
bargain
over
externals
in
a
*NL*
way
that
would
have
been
incredible
to
Aunt
Juley
,
and
*NL*
impossible
for
Tibby
or
Charles
.
There
are
moments
when
the
*NL*
inner
life
actually
``
pays
,
''
when
years
of
self-scrutiny
,
*NL*
conducted
for
no
ulterior
motive
,
are
suddenly
of
practical
*NL*
use
.
Such
moments
are
still
rare
in
the
West
;
that
they
*NL*
come
at
all
promises
a
fairer
future
.
Margaret
,
though
*NL*
unable
to
understand
her
sister
,
was
assured
against
*NL*
estrangement
,
and
returned
to
London
with
a
more
peaceful
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
following
morning
,
at
eleven
o'clock
,
she
presented
*NL*
herself
at
the
offices
of
the
Imperial
and
West
African
*NL*
Rubber
Company
.
She
was
glad
to
go
there
,
for
Henry
had
*NL*
implied
his
business
rather
than
described
it
,
and
the
*NL*
formlessness
and
vagueness
that
one
associates
with
Africa
*NL*
had
hitherto
brooded
over
the
main
sources
of
his
wealth
.
*NL*
Not
that
a
visit
to
the
office
cleared
things
up
.
There
was
*NL*
just
the
ordinary
surface
scum
of
ledgers
and
polished
*NL*
counters
and
brass
bars
that
began
and
stopped
for
no
*NL*
possible
reason
,
of
electric-light
globes
blossoming
in
*NL*
triplets
,
of
little
rabbit
hutches
faced
with
glass
or
wire
,
*NL*
of
little
rabbits
.
And
even
when
she
penetrated
to
the
*NL*
inner
depths
,
she
found
only
the
ordinary
table
and
Turkey
*NL*
carpet
,
and
though
the
map
over
the
fireplace
did
depict
a
*NL*
helping
of
West
Africa
,
it
was
a
very
ordinary
map
.
Another
*NL*
map
hung
opposite
,
on
which
the
whole
continent
appeared
,
*NL*
looking
like
a
whale
marked
out
for
blubber
,
and
by
its
side
*NL*
was
a
door
,
shut
,
but
Henry
's
voice
came
through
it
,
*NL*
dictating
a
``
strong
''
letter
.
She
might
have
been
at
the
*NL*
Porphyrion
,
or
Dempster
's
Bank
,
or
her
own
wine-merchant
's
.
*NL*
Everything
seems
just
alike
in
these
days
.
But
perhaps
she
*NL*
was
seeing
the
Imperial
side
of
the
company
rather
than
its
*NL*
West
African
,
and
Imperialism
always
had
been
one
of
her
*NL*
difficulties
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
minute
!
''
called
Mr.
Wilcox
on
receiving
her
name
.
*NL*
He
touched
a
bell
,
the
effect
of
which
was
to
produce
Charles
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
had
written
his
father
an
adequate
letter
--
more
*NL*
adequate
than
Evie
's
,
through
which
a
girlish
indignation
*NL*
throbbed
.
And
he
greeted
his
future
stepmother
with
propriety
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
that
my
wife
--
how
do
you
do
?
--
will
give
you
a
*NL*
decent
lunch

was
his
opening
.
``
I
left
instructions

but
*NL*
we
live

rough-and-ready
way

She
expects
you
back
to

tea
,
too
,
after
you
have
had
a
look
at
Howards
End
.
I
*NL*
wonder
what
you
'll
think
of
the
place

I
would
n't
touch
it
*NL*
with
tongs
myself

Do
sit
down

It
's
a
measly
little
place

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
enjoy
seeing
it
,

said
Margaret
,
feeling
,
for
*NL*
the
first
time
,
shy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
see
it
at
its
worst

abroad

last
Monday
without
even
arranging

charwoman
to
clear
*NL*
up
after
him

I
never
saw
such
a
disgraceful
mess

*NL*
``

more
than

called
Henry
from
the
inner
chamber

*NL*
*NL*
``

Mr.

joining

modestly

``
The

``

asked
Margaret

But
nobody
cared

Mr.
Bryce
was
the
tenant
,
who
had
no

right
to
sublet
;
to
have
defined
him
further
was
a
waste
of

time

On
his
misdeeds
they
descanted
profusely
,
until
the
*NL*
girl
who
had
been
typing
the
strong
letter
came
out
with
*NL*
it

Mr.

added
his

by
Margaret
,
*NL*
awaited
her
.
Charles
saw
them
in
,
civil
to
the
last
,
and
in
*NL*
a
moment
the
offices
of
the
Imperial
and
West
African
Rubber
*NL*
Company
faded
away
.
But
it
was
not
an
impressive
drive
.
*NL*
Perhaps
the
weather
was
to
blame
,
being
grey
and
banked
high
*NL*
with
weary
clouds
.
Perhaps
Hertfordshire
is
scarcely
*NL*
intended
for
motorists
.
Did
not
a
gentleman
once
motor
so
*NL*
quickly
through
Westmoreland
that
he
missed
it
?
and
if
*NL*
Westmoreland
can
be
missed
,
it
will
fare
ill
with
a
county
*NL*
whose
delicate
structure
particularly
needs
the
attentive
*NL*
eye
.
Hertfordshire
is
England
at
its
quietest
,
with
little
*NL*
emphasis
of
river
and
hill
;
it
is
England
meditative
.
If
*NL*
Drayton
were
with
us
again
to
write
a
new
edition
of
his
*NL*
incomparable
poem
,
he
would
sing
the
nymphs
of
Hertfordshire
*NL*
as
indeterminate
of
feature
,
with
hair
obfuscated
by
the
*NL*
London
smoke
.
Their
eyes
would
be
sad
,
and
averted
from
*NL*
their
fate
towards
the
Northern
flats
,
their
leader
not
Isis
*NL*
or
Sabrina
,
but
the
slowly
flowing
Lea
.
No
glory
of
raiment
*NL*
would
be
theirs
,
no
urgency
of
dance
;
but
they
would
be
real
*NL*
nymphs
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
chauffeur
could
not
travel
as
quickly
as
he
had
*NL*
hoped
,
for
the
Great
North
Road
was
full
of
Easter
traffic
.
*NL*
But
he
went
quite
quick
enough
for
Margaret
,
a
poor-spirited
*NL*
creature
,
who
had
chickens
and
children
on
the
brain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
all
right
,
''
said
Mr.
Wilcox
.
``
They
'll
*NL*
learn
--
like
the
swallows
and
the
telegraph-wires
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
,
while
they
're
learning
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
motor
's
come
to
stay
,
''
he
answered
.
``
One
must
get
*NL*
about
.
There
's
a
pretty
church
--
oh
,
you
are
n't
sharp
*NL*
enough
.
Well
,
look
out
,
if
the
road
worries
you
--
right
*NL*
outward
at
the
scenery
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
the
scenery
.
It
heaved
and
merged
like
*NL*
porridge
.
Presently
it
congealed
.
They
had
arrived
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
's
house
on
the
left
;
on
the
right
the
swelling
*NL*
forms
of
the
Six
Hills
.
Their
appearance
in
such
a
*NL*
neighbourhood
surprised
her
.
They
interrupted
the
stream
of
*NL*
residences
that
was
thickening
up
towards
Hilton
.
Beyond
*NL*
them
she
saw
meadows
and
a
wood
,
and
beneath
them
she
*NL*
settled
that
soldiers
of
the
best
kind
lay
buried
.
She
*NL*
hated
war
and
liked
soldiers
--
it
was
one
of
her
amiable
*NL*
inconsistencies
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
here
was
Dolly
,
dressed
up
to
the
nines
,
standing
at
*NL*
the
door
to
greet
them
,
and
here
were
the
first
drops
of
the
*NL*
rain
.
They
ran
in
gaily
,
and
after
a
long
wait
in
the
*NL*
drawing-room
sat
down
to
the
rough-and-ready
lunch
,
every
*NL*
dish
in
which
concealed
or
exuded
cream
.
Mr.
Bryce
was
the
*NL*
chief
topic
of
conversation
.
Dolly
described
his
visit
with
*NL*
the
key
,
while
her
father-in-law
gave
satisfaction
by
*NL*
chaffing
her
and
contradicting
all
she
said
.
It
was
*NL*
evidently
the
custom
to
laugh
at
Dolly
.
He
chaffed
*NL*
Margaret
,
too
,
and
Margaret
,
roused
from
a
grave
meditation
,
*NL*
was
pleased
,
and
chaffed
him
back
.
Dolly
seemed
surprised
,
*NL*
and
eyed
her
curiously
.
After
lunch
the
two
children
came
*NL*
down
.
Margaret
disliked
babies
,
but
hit
it
off
better
with
*NL*
the
two-year-old
,
and
sent
Dolly
into
fits
of
laughter
by
*NL*
talking
sense
to
him
.
``
Kiss
them
now
,
and
come
away
,
''
said
*NL*
Mr.
Wilcox
.
She
came
,
but
refused
to
kiss
them
:
it
was
such
*NL*
hard
luck
on
the
little
things
,
she
said
,
and
though
Dolly
*NL*
proffered
Chorly-worly
and
Porgly-woggles
in
turn
,
she
was
obdurate
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
it
was
raining
steadily
.
The
car
came
*NL*
round
with
the
hood
up
,
and
again
she
lost
all
sense
of
*NL*
space
.
In
a
few
minutes
they
stopped
,
and
Crane
opened
the
*NL*
door
of
the
car
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
happened
?
''
asked
Margaret
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
suppose
?
''
said
Henry
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
little
porch
was
close
up
against
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
we
there
already
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
never
!
In
years
ago
it
seemed
so
far
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Smiling
,
but
somehow
disillusioned
,
she
jumped
out
,
and
*NL*
her
impetus
carried
her
to
the
front-door
.
She
was
about
to
*NL*
open
it
,
when
Henry
said
:
``
That
's
no
good
;
it
's
locked
.
*NL*
Who
's
got
the
key
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
had
himself
forgotten
to
call
for
the
key
at
the
*NL*
farm
,
no
one
replied
.
He
also
wanted
to
know
who
had
left
*NL*
the
front
gate
open
,
since
a
cow
had
strayed
in
from
the
*NL*
road
,
and
was
spoiling
the
croquet
lawn
.
Then
he
said
*NL*
rather
crossly
:
``
Margaret
,
you
wait
in
the
dry
.
I
'll
go
*NL*
down
for
the
key
.
It
is
n't
a
hundred
yards
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
n't
I
come
too
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
shall
be
back
before
I
'm
gone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
car
turned
away
,
and
it
was
as
if
a
curtain
had
*NL*
risen
.
For
the
second
time
that
day
she
saw
the
appearance
*NL*
of
the
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
the
greengage-trees
that
Helen
had
once
*NL*
described
,
there
the
tennis
lawn
,
there
the
hedge
that
would
*NL*
be
glorious
with
dog-roses
in
June
,
but
the
vision
now
was
*NL*
of
black
and
palest
green
.
Down
by
the
dell-hole
more
vivid
*NL*
colours
were
awakening
,
and
Lent
Lilies
stood
sentinel
on
*NL*
its
margin
,
or
advanced
in
battalions
over
the
grass
.
*NL*
Tulips
were
a
tray
of
jewels
.
She
could
not
see
the
*NL*
wych-elm
tree
,
but
a
branch
of
the
celebrated
vine
,
studded
*NL*
with
velvet
knobs
,
had
covered
the
porch
.
She
was
struck
by
*NL*
the
fertility
of
the
soil
;
she
had
seldom
been
in
a
garden
*NL*
where
the
flowers
looked
so
well
,
and
even
the
weeds
she
was
*NL*
idly
plucking
out
of
the
porch
were
intensely
green
.
Why
*NL*
had
poor
Mr.
Bryce
fled
from
all
this
beauty
?
For
she
had
*NL*
already
decided
that
the
place
was
beautiful
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Naughty
cow
!
Go
away
!
''
cried
Margaret
to
the
cow
,
but
*NL*
without
indignation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Harder
came
the
rain
,
pouring
out
of
a
windless
sky
,
and
*NL*
spattering
up
from
the
notice-boards
of
the
house-agents
,
*NL*
which
lay
in
a
row
on
the
lawn
where
Charles
had
hurled
*NL*
them
.
She
must
have
interviewed
Charles
in
another
*NL*
world
--
where
one
did
have
interviews
.
How
Helen
would
revel
*NL*
in
such
a
notion
!
Charles
dead
,
all
people
dead
,
nothing
*NL*
alive
but
houses
and
gardens
.
The
obvious
dead
,
the
*NL*
intangible
alive
,
and
--
no
connection
at
all
between
them
!
*NL*
Margaret
smiled
.
Would
that
her
own
fancies
were
as
*NL*
clear-cut
!
Would
that
she
could
deal
as
high-handedly
with
*NL*
the
world
!
Smiling
and
sighing
,
she
laid
her
hand
upon
the
*NL*
door
.
It
opened
.
The
house
was
not
locked
up
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
hesitated
.
Ought
she
to
wait
for
Henry
?
He
felt
*NL*
strongly
about
property
,
and
might
prefer
to
show
her
over
*NL*
himself
.
On
the
other
hand
,
he
had
told
her
to
keep
in
the
*NL*
dry
,
and
the
porch
was
beginning
to
drip
.
So
she
went
in
,
*NL*
and
the
drought
from
inside
slammed
the
door
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Desolation
greeted
her
.
Dirty
finger-prints
were
on
the
*NL*
hall-windows
,
flue
and
rubbish
on
its
unwashed
boards
.
The
*NL*
civilization
of
luggage
had
been
here
for
a
month
,
and
then
*NL*
decamped
.
Dining-room
and
drawing
room
--
right
and
*NL*
left
--
were
guessed
only
by
their
wall-papers
.
They
were
*NL*
just
rooms
where
one
could
shelter
from
the
rain
.
Across
*NL*
the
ceiling
of
each
ran
a
great
beam
.
The
dining-room
and
*NL*
hall
revealed
theirs
openly
,
but
the
drawing-room
's
was
*NL*
match-boarded
--
because
the
facts
of
life
must
be
concealed
*NL*
from
ladies
?
Drawing-room
,
dining-room
,
and
hall
--
how
petty
*NL*
the
names
sounded
!
Here
were
simply
three
rooms
where
*NL*
children
could
play
and
friends
shelter
from
the
rain
.
Yes
,
*NL*
and
they
were
beautiful
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
opened
one
of
the
doors
opposite
--
there
were
*NL*
two
--
and
exchanged
wall-papers
for
whitewash
.
It
was
the
*NL*
servants
'
part
,
though
she
scarcely
realized
that
:
just
*NL*
rooms
again
,
where
friends
might
shelter
.
The
garden
at
the
*NL*
back
was
full
of
flowering
cherries
and
plums
.
Farther
on
*NL*
were
hints
of
the
meadow
and
a
black
cliff
of
pines
.
Yes
,
*NL*
the
meadow
was
beautiful
.
*NL*
*NL*
Penned
in
by
the
desolate
weather
,
she
recaptured
the
*NL*
sense
of
space
which
the
motor
had
tried
to
rob
from
her
.
*NL*
She
remembered
again
that
ten
square
miles
are
not
ten
times
*NL*
as
wonderful
as
one
square
mile
,
that
a
thousand
square
*NL*
miles
are
not
practically
the
same
as
heaven
.
The
phantom
*NL*
of
bigness
,
which
London
encourages
,
was
laid
for
ever
when
*NL*
she
paced
from
the
hall
at
Howards
End
to
its
kitchen
and
*NL*
heard
the
rains
run
this
way
and
that
where
the
watershed
of
*NL*
the
roof
divided
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
Helen
came
to
her
mind
,
scrutinizing
half
Wessex
*NL*
from
the
ridge
of
the
Purbeck
Downs
,
and
saying
:
``
You
will
*NL*
have
to
lose
something
.
''
She
was
not
so
sure
.
For
instance
,
*NL*
she
would
double
her
kingdom
by
opening
the
door
that
*NL*
concealed
the
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
she
thought
of
the
map
of
Africa
;
of
empires
;
of
her
*NL*
father
;
of
the
two
supreme
nations
,
streams
of
whose
life
*NL*
warmed
her
blood
,
but
,
mingling
,
had
cooled
her
brain
.
She
*NL*
paced
back
into
the
hall
,
and
as
she
did
so
the
house
reverberated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
you
,
Henry
?
''
she
called
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
answer
,
but
the
house
reverberated
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Henry
,
have
you
got
in
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
the
heart
of
the
house
beating
,
faintly
at
*NL*
first
,
then
loudly
,
martially
.
It
dominated
the
rain
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
the
starved
imagination
,
not
the
well-nourished
,
*NL*
that
is
afraid
.
Margaret
flung
open
the
door
to
the
*NL*
stairs
.
A
noise
as
of
drums
seemed
to
deafen
her
.
A
woman
,
*NL*
an
old
woman
,
was
descending
,
with
figure
erect
,
with
face
*NL*
impassive
,
with
lips
that
parted
and
said
dryly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Well
,
I
took
you
for
Ruth
Wilcox
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
stammered
:
``
I
--
Mrs.
Wilcox
--
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
fancy
,
of
course
--
in
fancy
.
You
had
her
way
of
*NL*
walking
.
Good-day
.
''
And
the
old
woman
passed
out
into
the
*NL*
rain
.

Chapter

*NL*
``
It
gave
her
quite
a
turn
,
''
said
Mr.
Wilcox
,
when
retailing
*NL*
the
incident
to
Dolly
at
tea-time
.
``
None
of
you
girls
have
*NL*
any
nerves
,
really
.
Of
course
,
a
word
from
me
put
it
all
*NL*
right
,
but
silly
old
Miss
Avery
--
she
frightened
you
,
did
n't
*NL*
she
,
Margaret
?
There
you
stood
clutching
a
bunch
of
weeds
.
*NL*
She
might
have
said
something
,
instead
of
coming
down
the
*NL*
stairs
with
that
alarming
bonnet
on
.
I
passed
her
as
I
came
*NL*
in
.
Enough
to
make
the
car
shy
.
I
believe
Miss
Avery
goes
*NL*
in
for
being
a
character
;
some
old
maids
do
.
''
He
lit
a
*NL*
cigarette
.
``
It
is
their
last
resource
.
Heaven
knows
what
*NL*
she
was
doing
in
the
place
;
but
that
's
Bryce
's
business
,
not
*NL*
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
n't
as
foolish
as
you
suggest
,
''
said
Margaret
.
*NL*
``
She
only
startled
me
,
for
the
house
had
been
silent
so
long
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
take
her
for
a
spook
?
''
asked
Dolly
,
for
whom
*NL*
``
spooks
''
and
``
going
to
church
''
summarized
the
unseen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
exactly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
really
did
frighten
you
,
''
said
Henry
,
who
was
far
*NL*
from
discouraging
timidity
in
females
.
``
Poor
Margaret
!
And
*NL*
very
naturally
.
Uneducated
classes
are
so
stupid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Miss
Avery
uneducated
classes
?
''
Margaret
asked
,
and
*NL*
found
herself
looking
at
the
decoration
scheme
of
Dolly
's
*NL*
drawing-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
just
one
of
the
crew
at
the
farm
.
People
like
*NL*
that
always
assume
things

She
assumed
you
'd
know
who
she
*NL*
was
.
She
left
all
the
Howards
End
keys
in
the
front
lobby
,
*NL*
and
assumed
that
you
'd
seen
them

that
you

lock
up
the
house
when
you

done

on

down

And
there
was
her

hunting
for

down

at
the
farm

of
women

I
should

disliked
it

perhaps

*NL*
*NL*
``

Miss
Avery
giving
me
a
wedding
present

said
Dolly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Which
was
illogical

interesting
.
Through
Dolly
,
*NL*
Margaret
was
destined
to
learn
a
good
deal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
Charles
said
I
must
try
not
to
mind

because
she
*NL*
had
known
his
grandmother

*NL*
*NL*
``
As
usual
,
you
've
got
the
story
wrong

good
Dorothea

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
great-grandmother
--
the
one
who
left
Mrs.
Wilcox
*NL*
the
house

Were
n't
both
of
them
and
Miss
Avery
friends
when
*NL*
Howards
End
,
too
,
was
a
farm
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
father-in-law
blew
out
a
shaft
of
smoke
.
His
*NL*
attitude
to
his
dead
wife
was
curious
.
He
would
allude
to
*NL*
her
,
and
hear
her
discussed
,
but
never
mentioned
her
by
*NL*
name
.
Nor
was
he
interested
in
the
dim
,
bucolic
past
.
*NL*
Dolly
was
--
for
the
following
reason
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
had
n't
Mrs.
Wilcox
a
brother

or
was
it
an
uncle

Anyhow
,
he
popped
the
question
,
and
Miss
Avery
,
she
said
*NL*
`
No

'
Just
imagine
,
if
she
'd
said
`
Yes
,
'
she
would
have
been
*NL*
Charles

-LRB-
Oh
,
I

,

that
's
rather
good

Aunt

!
I
must
chaff
him
about
that
this
evening

-RRB-
And
the
*NL*
man
went
out
and
was
killed
.
Yes
,
I
'm
certain
I
've
got
it
*NL*
right

Tom
Howard
--
he
was
the
last
of
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
so

said
Mr.

negligently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say

Howards
End

Howard
's
Ended
!

cried
Dolly
.
*NL*
``
I
'm
rather
on
the
spot
this
evening

eh

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
you
'd
ask
whether

*NL*
*NL*

Oh
,
Mr.
Wilcox
,
how
CAN
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
,
if
he
has
had
enough
tea
,
we
ought
to
*NL*
go

--
Dolly
's
a
good
little
woman
,
''
he
continued
,
``
but
a
*NL*
little
of
her
goes
a
long
way
.
I
could
n't
live
near
her
if
*NL*
you
paid
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
smiled
.
Though
presenting
a
firm
front
to
*NL*
outsiders
,
no
Wilcox
could
live
near
,
or
near
the
*NL*
possessions
of
,
any
other
Wilcox
.
They
had
the
colonial
*NL*
spirit
,
and
were
always
making
for
some
spot
where
the
white
*NL*
man
might
carry
his
burden
unobserved
.
Of
course
,
Howards
*NL*
End
was
impossible
,
so
long
as
the
younger
couple
were
*NL*
established
in
Hilton
.
His
objections
to
the
house
were
*NL*
plain
as
daylight
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
Crane
had
had
enough
tea
,
and
was
sent
to
the
garage
,
*NL*
where
their
car
had
been
trickling
muddy
water
over
*NL*
Charles
's
.
The
downpour
had
surely
penetrated
the
Six
Hills
*NL*
by
now
,
bringing
news
of
our
restless
civilization
.
*NL*
``
Curious
mounds
,
''
said
,
Henry
,
``
but
in
with
you
now
;
another
*NL*
time
.
''
He
had
to
be
up
in
London
by
seven
--
if
possible
,
by
*NL*
six-thirty
.
Once
more
she
lost
the
sense
of
space
;
once
*NL*
more
trees
,
houses
,
people
,
animals
,
hills
,
merged
and
*NL*
heaved
into
one
dirtiness
,
and
she
was
at
Wickham
Place
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
evening
was
pleasant
.
The
sense
of
flux
which
had
*NL*
haunted
her
all
the
year
disappeared
for
a
time
.
She
forgot
*NL*
the
luggage
and
the
motor-cars
,
and
the
hurrying
men
who
*NL*
know
so
much
and
connect
so
little
.
She
recaptured
the
*NL*
sense
of
space
,
which
is
the
basis
of
all
earthly
beauty
,
*NL*
and
,
starting
from
Howards
End
,
she
attempted
to
realize
*NL*
England
.
She
failed
--
visions
do
not
come
when
we
try
,
*NL*
though
they
may
come
through
trying
.
But
an
unexpected
love
*NL*
of
the
island
awoke
in
her
,
connecting
on
this
side
with
the
*NL*
joys
of
the
flesh
,
on
that
with
the
inconceivable
.
Helen
*NL*
and
her
father
had
known
this
love
,
poor
Leonard
Bast
was
*NL*
groping
after
it
,
but
it
had
been
hidden
from
Margaret
till
*NL*
this
afternoon
.
It
had
certainly
come
through
the
house
and
*NL*
old
Miss
Avery
.
Through
them
:
the
notion
of
``
through
''
*NL*
persisted
;
her
mind
trembled
towards
a
conclusion
which
only
*NL*
the
unwise
have
put
into
words
.
Then
,
veering
back
into
*NL*
warmth
,
it
dwelt
on
ruddy
bricks
,
flowering
plum-trees
,
and
*NL*
all
the
tangible
joys
of
,
spring
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henry
,
after
allaying
her
agitation
,
had
taken
her
over
*NL*
his
property
,
and
had
explained
to
her
the
use
and
*NL*
dimensions
of
the
various
rooms
.
He
had
sketched
the
*NL*
history
of
the
little
estate
.
``
It
is
so
unlucky
,
''
ran
the
*NL*
monologue
,
``
that
money
was
n't
put
into
it
about
fifty
years
*NL*
ago
.
Then
it
had
four
--
five-times
the
land
--
thirty
acres
at
*NL*
least
.
One
could
have
made
something
out
of
it
then
--
a
*NL*
small
park
,
or
at
all
events
shrubberies
,
and
rebuilt
the
*NL*
house
farther
away
from
the
road
.
What
's
the
good
of
taking
*NL*
it
in
hand
now
?
Nothing
but
the
meadow
left
,
and
even
that
*NL*
was
heavily
mortgaged
when
I
first
had
to
do
with
*NL*
things
--
yes
,
and
the
house
too
.
Oh
,
it
was
no
joke
.
''
She
*NL*
saw
two
women
as
he
spoke
,
one
old
,
the
other
young
,
*NL*
watching
their
inheritance
melt
away
.
She
saw
them
greet
*NL*
him
as
a
deliverer
.
``
Mismanagement
did
it
--
besides
,
the
*NL*
days
for
small
farms
are
over
.
It
does
n't
pay
--
except
with
*NL*
intensive
cultivation
.
Small
holdings
,
back
to
the
*NL*
land
--
ah
!
philanthropic
bunkum
.
Take
it
as
a
rule
that
*NL*
nothing
pays
on
a
small
scale
.
Most
of
the
land
you
see
*NL*
-LRB-
they
were
standing
at
an
upper
window
,
the
only
one
which
*NL*
faced
west
-RRB-
belongs
to
the
people
at
the
Park
--
they
made
*NL*
their
pile
over
copper
--
good
chaps
.
Avery
's
Farm
,
*NL*
Sishe
's
--
what
they
call
the
Common
,
where
you
see
that
*NL*
ruined
oak
--
one
after
the
other
fell
in
,
and
so
did
this
,
as
*NL*
near
as
is
no
matter
.
``
But
Henry
had
saved
it
;
without
fine
*NL*
feelings
or
deep
insight
,
but
he
had
saved
it
,
and
she
loved
*NL*
him
for
the
deed
.
``
When
I
had
more
control
I
did
what
I
*NL*
could
:
sold
off
the
two
and
a
half
animals
,
and
the
mangy
*NL*
pony
,
and
the
superannuated
tools
;
pulled
down
the
*NL*
outhouses
;
drained
;
thinned
out
I
do
n't
know
how
many
*NL*
guelder-roses
and
elder-trees
;
and
inside
the
house
I
turned
*NL*
the
old
kitchen
into
a
hall
,
and
made
a
kitchen
behind
where
*NL*
the
dairy
was
.
Garage
and
so
on
came
later
.
But
one
could
*NL*
still
tell
it
's
been
an
old
farm
.
And
yet
it
is
n't
the
*NL*
place
that
would
fetch
one
of
your
artistic
crew
.
''
No
,
it
*NL*
was
n't
;
and
if
he
did
not
quite
understand
it
,
the
artistic
*NL*
crew
would
still
less
:
it
was
English
,
and
the
wych-elm
that
*NL*
she
saw
from
the
window
was
an
English
tree
.
No
report
had
*NL*
prepared
her
for
its
peculiar
glory
.
It
was
neither
*NL*
warrior
,
nor
lover
,
nor
god
;
in
none
of
these
roles
do
the
*NL*
English
excel
.
It
was
a
comrade
,
bending
over
the
house
,
*NL*
strength
and
adventure
in
its
roots
,
but
in
its
utmost
*NL*
fingers
tenderness
,
and
the
girth
,
that
a
dozen
men
could
*NL*
not
have
spanned
,
became
in
the
end
evanescent
,
till
pale
*NL*
bud
clusters
seemed
to
float
in
the
air
.
It
was
a
comrade
.
*NL*
House
and
tree
transcended
any
similes
of
sex
.
Margaret
*NL*
thought
of
them
now
,
and
was
to
think
of
them
through
many
a
*NL*
windy
night
and
London
day
,
but
to
compare
either
to
man
,
to
*NL*
woman
,
always
dwarfed
the
vision
.
Yet
they
kept
within
*NL*
limits
of
the
human
.
Their
message
was
not
of
eternity
,
but
*NL*
of
hope
on
this
side
of
the
grave
.
As
she
stood
in
the
one
,
*NL*
gazing
at
the
other
,
truer
relationship
had
gleamed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
touch
,
and
the
account
of
her
day
is
finished
.
*NL*
They
entered
the
garden
for
a
minute
,
and
to
Mr.
Wilcox
's
*NL*
surprise
she
was
right
.
Teeth
,
pigs
'
teeth
,
could
be
seen
*NL*
in
the
bark
of
the
wych-elm
tree
--
just
the
white
tips
of
*NL*
them
showing
.
``
Extraordinary
!
''
he
cried
.
``
Who
told
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
heard
of
it
one
winter
in
London
,
''
was
her
answer
,
*NL*
for
she
,
too
,
avoided
mentioning
Mrs.
Wilcox
by
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
25
*NL*
*NL*
Evie
heard
of
her
father
's
engagement
when
she
was
in
for
a
*NL*
tennis
tournament
,
and
her
play
went
simply
to
pot
.
That
*NL*
she
should
marry
and
leave
him
had
seemed
natural
enough
;
*NL*
that
he
,
left
alone
,
should
do
the
same
was
deceitful
;
and
*NL*
now
Charles
and
Dolly
said
that
it
was
all
her
fault
.
``
But
*NL*
I
never
dreamt
of
such
a
thing
,
''
she
grumbled
.
``
Dad
took
me
*NL*
to
call
now
and
then
,
and
made
me
ask
her
to
Simpson
's
.
*NL*
Well
,
I
'm
altogether
off
Dad
.
''
It
was
also
an
insult
to
*NL*
their
mother
's
memory
;
there
they
were
agreed
,
and
Evie
had
*NL*
the
idea
of
returning
Mrs.
Wilcox
's
lace
and
jewellery
``
as
a
*NL*
protest
.
''
Against
what
it
would
protest
she
was
not
clear
;
*NL*
but
being
only
eighteen
,
the
idea
of
renunciation
appealed
*NL*
to
her
,
the
more
as
she
did
not
care
for
jewellery
or
lace
.
*NL*
Dolly
then
suggested
that
she
and
Uncle
Percy
should
pretend
*NL*
to
break
off
their
engagement
,
and
then
perhaps
Mr.
Wilcox
*NL*
would
quarrel
with
Miss
Schlegel
,
and
break
off
his
;
or
Paul
*NL*
might
be
cabled
for
.
But
at
this
point
Charles
told
them
*NL*
not
to
talk
nonsense
.
So
Evie
settled
to
marry
as
soon
as
*NL*
possible
;
it
was
no
good
hanging
about
with
these
Schlegels
*NL*
eyeing
her
.
The
date
of
her
wedding
was
consequently
put
*NL*
forward
from
September
to
August
,
and
in
the
intoxication
of
*NL*
presents
she
recovered
much
of
her
good-humour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
found
that
she
was
expected
to
figure
at
this
*NL*
function
,
and
to
figure
largely
;
it
would
be
such
an
*NL*
opportunity
,
said
Henry
,
for
her
to
get
to
know
his
set
.
*NL*
Sir
James
Bidder
would
be
there
,
and
all
the
Cahills
and
the
*NL*
Fussells
,
and
his
sister-in-law
,
Mrs.
Warrington
Wilcox
,
had
*NL*
fortunately
got
back
from
her
tour
round
the
world
.
Henry
*NL*
she
loved
,
but
his
set
promised
to
be
another
matter
.
He
*NL*
had
not
the
knack
of
surrounding
himself
with
nice
*NL*
people
--
indeed
,
for
a
man
of
ability
and
virtue
his
choice
*NL*
had
been
singularly
unfortunate
;
he
had
no
guiding
principle
*NL*
beyond
a
certain
preference
for
mediocrity
;
he
was
content
*NL*
to
settle
one
of
the
greatest
things
in
life
haphazard
,
and
*NL*
so
,
while
his
investments
went
right
,
his
friends
generally
*NL*
went
wrong
.
She
would
be
told
,
``
Oh
,
So-and-so
's
a
good
*NL*
sort
--
a
thundering
good
sort
,
''
and
find
,
on
meeting
him
,
*NL*
that
he
was
a
brute
or
a
bore
.
If
Henry
had
shown
real
*NL*
affection
,
she
would
have
understood
,
for
affection
explains
*NL*
everything
.
But
he
seemed
without
sentiment
.
The
*NL*
``
thundering
good
sort
''
might
at
any
moment
become
``
a
fellow
*NL*
for
whom
I
never
did
have
much
use
,
and
have
less
now
,
''
and
*NL*
be
shaken
off
cheerily
into
oblivion
.
Margaret
had
done
the
*NL*
same
as
a
schoolgirl
.
Now
she
never
forgot
anyone
for
whom
*NL*
she
had
once
cared
;
she
connected
,
though
the
connection
*NL*
might
be
bitter
,
and
she
hoped
that
some
day
Henry
would
do
*NL*
the
same
.
*NL*
*NL*
Evie
was
not
to
be
married
from
Ducie
Street
.
She
had
a
*NL*
fancy
for
something
rural
,
and
,
besides
,
no
one
would
be
in
*NL*
London
then
,
so
she
left
her
boxes
for
a
few
weeks
at
Oniton
*NL*
Grange
,
and
her
banns
were
duly
published
in
the
parish
*NL*
church
,
and
for
a
couple
of
days
the
little
town
,
dreaming
*NL*
between
the
ruddy
hills
,
was
roused
by
the
clang
of
our
*NL*
civilization
,
and
drew
up
by
the
roadside
to
let
the
motors
*NL*
pass
.
Oniton
had
been
a
discovery
of
Mr.
Wilcox
's
--
a
*NL*
discovery
of
which
he
was
not
altogether
proud
.
It
was
up
*NL*
towards
the
Welsh
border
,
and
so
difficult
of
access
that
he
*NL*
had
concluded
it
must
be
something
special
.
A
ruined
castle
*NL*
stood
in
the
grounds
.
But
having
got
there
,
what
was
one
to
*NL*
do
?
The
shooting
was
bad
,
the
fishing
indifferent
,
and
*NL*
women-folk
reported
the
scenery
as
nothing
much
.
The
place
*NL*
turned
out
to
be
in
the
wrong
part
of
Shropshire
,
damn
it
,
*NL*
and
though
he
never
damned
his
own
property
aloud
,
he
was
*NL*
only
waiting
to
get
it
off
his
hands
,
and
then
to
let
fly
.
*NL*
Evie
's
marriage
was
its
last
appearance
in
public
.
As
soon
*NL*
as
a
tenant
was
found
,
it
became
a
house
for
which
he
never
*NL*
had
had
much
use
,
and
had
less
now
,
and
,
like
Howards
End
,
*NL*
faded
into
Limbo
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
on
Margaret
Oniton
was
destined
to
make
a
lasting
*NL*
impression
.
She
regarded
it
as
her
future
home
,
and
was
*NL*
anxious
to
start
straight
with
the
clergy
,
etc.
,
and
,
if
*NL*
possible
,
to
see
something
of
the
local
life
.
It
was
a
*NL*
market-town
--
as
tiny
a
one
as
England
possesses
--
and
had
for
*NL*
ages
served
that
lonely
valley
,
and
guarded
our
marches
*NL*
against
the
Kelt
.
In
spite
of
the
occasion
,
in
spite
of
the
*NL*
numbing
hilarity
that
greeted
her
as
soon
as
she
got
into
*NL*
the
reserved
saloon
at
Paddington
,
her
senses
were
awake
and
*NL*
watching
,
and
though
Oniton
was
to
prove
one
of
her
*NL*
innumerable
false
starts
,
she
never
forgot
it
,
nor
the
*NL*
things
that
happened
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
London
party
only
numbered
eight
--
the
Fussells
,
*NL*
father
and
son
,
two
Anglo-Indian
ladies
named
Mrs.
*NL*
Plynlimmon
and
Lady
Edser
,
Mrs.
Warrington
Wilcox
and
her
*NL*
daughter
,
and
lastly
,
the
little
girl
,
very
smart
and
quiet
,
*NL*
who
figures
at
so
many
weddings
,
and
who
kept
a
watchful
eye
*NL*
on
Margaret
,
the
bride-elect
,
Dolly
was
absent
--
a
domestic
*NL*
event
detained
her
at
Hilton
;
Paul
had
cabled
a
humorous
*NL*
message
;
Charles
was
to
meet
them
with
a
trio
of
motors
at
*NL*
Shrewsbury
.
Helen
had
refused
her
invitation
;
Tibby
had
*NL*
never
answered
his
.
The
management
was
excellent
,
as
was
to
*NL*
be
expected
with
anything
that
Henry
undertook
;
one
was
*NL*
conscious
of
his
sensible
and
generous
brain
in
the
*NL*
background
.
They
were
his
guests
as
soon
as
they
reached
*NL*
the
train
;
a
special
label
for
their
luggage
;
a
courier
;
a
*NL*
special
lunch
;
they
had
only
to
look
pleasant
and
,
where
*NL*
possible
,
pretty
.
Margaret
thought
with
dismay
of
her
own
*NL*
nuptials
--
presumably
under
the
management
of
Tibby
.
``
Mr.
*NL*
Theobald
Schlegel
and
Miss
Helen
Schlegel
request
the
*NL*
pleasure
of
Mrs.
Plynlimmon
's
company
on
the
occasion
of
the
*NL*
marriage
of
their
sister
Margaret
.
''
The
formula
was
*NL*
incredible
,
but
it
must
soon
be
printed
and
sent
,
and
though
*NL*
Wickham
Place
need
not
compete
with
Oniton
,
it
must
feed
its
*NL*
guests
properly
,
and
provide
them
with
sufficient
chairs
.
*NL*
Her
wedding
would
either
be
ramshackly
or
bourgeois
--
she
*NL*
hoped
the
latter
.
Such
an
affair
as
the
present
,
staged
*NL*
with
a
deftness
that
was
almost
beautiful
,
lay
beyond
her
*NL*
powers
and
those
of
her
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
low
rich
purr
of
a
Great
Western
express
is
not
the
*NL*
worst
background
for
conversation
,
and
the
journey
passed
*NL*
pleasantly
enough
.
Nothing
could
have
exceeded
the
kindness
*NL*
of
the
two
men
.
They
raised
windows
for
some
ladies
,
and
*NL*
lowered
them
for
others
,
they
rang
the
bell
for
the
servant
,
*NL*
they
identified
the
colleges
as
the
train
slipped
past
*NL*
Oxford
,
they
caught
books
or
bag-purses
in
the
act
of
*NL*
tumbling
on
to
the
floor
.
Yet
there
was
nothing
finicky
*NL*
about
their
politeness
:
it
had
the
Public
School
touch
,
and
,
*NL*
though
sedulous
,
was
virile
.
More
battles
than
Waterloo
*NL*
have
been
won
on
our
playing-fields
,
and
Margaret
bowed
to
a
*NL*
charm
of
which
she
did
not
wholly
approve
,
and
said
nothing
*NL*
when
the
Oxford
colleges
were
identified
wrongly
.
``
Male
and
*NL*
female
created
He
them
''
;
the
journey
to
Shrewsbury
confirmed
*NL*
this
questionable
statement
,
and
the
long
glass
saloon
,
that
*NL*
moved
so
easily
and
felt
so
comfortable
,
became
a
*NL*
forcing-house
for
the
idea
of
sex
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
Shrewsbury
came
fresh
air
.
Margaret
was
all
for
*NL*
sight-seeing
,
and
while
the
others
were
finishing
their
tea
*NL*
at
the
Raven
,
she
annexed
a
motor
and
hurried
over
the
*NL*
astonishing
city
.
Her
chauffeur
was
not
the
faithful
Crane
,
*NL*
but
an
Italian
,
who
dearly
loved
making
her
late
.
Charles
,
*NL*
watch
in
hand
,
though
with
a
level
brow
,
was
standing
in
*NL*
front
of
the
hotel
when
they
returned
.
It
was
perfectly
all
*NL*
right
,
he
told
her
;
she
was
by
no
means
the
last
.
And
then
*NL*
he
dived
into
the
coffee-room
,
and
she
heard
him
say
,
``
For
*NL*
God
's
sake
,
hurry
the
women
up
;
we
shall
never
be
off
,
''
and
*NL*
Albert
Fussell
reply
,
``
Not
I
;
I
've
done
my
share
,
''
and
*NL*
Colonel
Fussell
opine
that
the
ladies
were
getting
*NL*
themselves
up
to
kill
.
Presently
Myra
-LRB-
Mrs.
Warrington
's
*NL*
daughter
-RRB-
appeared
,
and
as
she
was
his
cousin
,
Charles
blew
*NL*
her
up
a
little
:
she
had
been
changing
her
smart
traveling
*NL*
hat
for
a
smart
motor
hat
.
Then
Mrs.
Warrington
herself
,
*NL*
leading
the
quiet
child
;
the
two
Anglo-Indian
ladies
were
*NL*
always
last
.
Maids
,
courier
,
heavy
luggage
,
had
already
*NL*
gone
on
by
a
branch-line
to
a
station
nearer
Oniton
,
but
*NL*
there
were
five
hat-boxes
and
four
dressing-bags
to
be
*NL*
packed
,
and
five
dust-cloaks
to
be
put
on
,
and
to
be
put
off
*NL*
at
the
last
moment
,
because
Charles
declared
them
not
*NL*
necessary
.
The
men
presided
over
everything
with
unfailing
*NL*
good-humour
.
By
half-past
five
the
party
was
ready
,
and
*NL*
went
out
of
Shrewsbury
by
the
Welsh
Bridge
.
*NL*
*NL*
Shropshire
had
not
the
reticence
of
Hertfordshire
.
*NL*
Though
robbed
of
half
its
magic
by
swift
movement
,
it
still
*NL*
conveyed
the
sense
of
hills
.
They
were
nearing
the
*NL*
buttresses
that
force
the
Severn
eastern
and
make
it
an
*NL*
English
stream
,
and
the
sun
,
sinking
over
the
Sentinels
of
*NL*
Wales
,
was
straight
in
their
eyes
.
Having
picked
up
another
*NL*
guest
,
they
turned
southward
,
avoiding
the
greater
*NL*
mountains
,
but
conscious
of
an
occasional
summit
,
rounded
*NL*
and
mild
,
whose
colouring
differed
in
quality
from
that
of
*NL*
the
lower
earth
,
and
whose
contours
altered
more
slowly
.
*NL*
Quiet
mysteries
were
in
progress
behind
those
tossing
*NL*
horizons
:
the
West
,
as
ever
,
was
retreating
with
some
secret
*NL*
which
may
not
be
worth
the
discovery
,
but
which
no
practical
*NL*
man
will
ever
discover
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
spoke
of
Tariff
Reform
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Warrington
was
just
back
from
the
Colonies
.
Like
*NL*
many
other
critics
of
Empire
,
her
mouth
had
been
stopped
*NL*
with
food
,
and
she
could
only
exclaim
at
the
hospitality
*NL*
with
which
she
had
been
received
,
and
warn
the
Mother
*NL*
Country
against
trifling
with
young
Titans
.
``
They
threaten
*NL*
to
cut
the
painter
,
''
she
cried
,
``
and
where
shall
we
be
*NL*
then
?
Miss
Schlegel
,
you
'll
undertake
to
keep
Henry
sound
*NL*
about
Tariff
Reform
?
It
is
our
last
hope
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
playfully
confessed
herself
on
the
other
side
,
*NL*
and
they
began
to
quote
from
their
respective
hand-books
*NL*
while
the
motor
carried
them
deep
into
the
hills
.
Curious
*NL*
these
were
,
rather
than
impressive
,
for
their
outlines
*NL*
lacked
beauty
,
and
the
pink
fields
--
on
their
summits
*NL*
suggested
the
handkerchiefs
of
a
giant
spread
out
to
dry
.
*NL*
An
occasional
outcrop
of
rock
,
an
occasional
wood
,
an
*NL*
occasional
``
forest
,
''
treeless
and
brown
,
all
hinted
at
*NL*
wildness
to
follow
,
but
the
main
colour
was
an
agricultural
*NL*
green
.
The
air
grew
cooler
;
they
had
surmounted
the
last
*NL*
gradient
,
and
Oniton
lay
below
them
with
its
church
,
its
*NL*
radiating
houses
,
its
castle
,
its
river-girt
peninsula
.
*NL*
Close
to
the
castle
was
a
grey
mansion
,
unintellectual
but
*NL*
kindly
,
stretching
with
its
grounds
across
the
peninsula
's
*NL*
neck
--
the
sort
of
mansion
that
was
built
all
over
England
in
*NL*
the
beginning
of
the
last
century
,
while
architecture
was
*NL*
still
an
expression
of
the
national
character
.
That
was
the
*NL*
Grange
,
remarked
Albert
,
over
his
shoulder
,
and
then
he
*NL*
jammed
the
brake
on
,
and
the
motor
slowed
down
and
stopped
.
*NL*
``
I
'm
sorry
,
''
said
he
,
turning
round
.
``
Do
you
mind
getting
*NL*
out
--
by
the
door
on
the
right
?
Steady
on
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
happened
?
''
asked
Mrs.
Warrington
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
car
behind
them
drew
up
,
and
the
voice
of
*NL*
Charles
was
heard
saying
:
``
Get
out
the
women
at
once
.
''
There
*NL*
was
a
concourse
of
males
,
and
Margaret
and
her
companions
*NL*
were
hustled
out
and
received
into
the
second
car
.
What
had
*NL*
happened
?
As
it
started
off
again
,
the
door
of
a
cottage
*NL*
opened
,
and
a
girl
screamed
wildly
at
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
the
ladies
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
drove
them
a
hundred
yards
without
speaking
.
*NL*
Then
he
said
:
``
It
's
all
right
.
Your
car
just
touched
a
dog
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
stop
!
''
cried
Margaret
,
horrified
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
did
n't
hurt
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
n't
really
hurt
him
?
''
asked
Myra
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
PLEASE
stop
!
''
said
Margaret
,
leaning
forward
.
She
*NL*
was
standing
up
in
the
car
,
the
other
occupants
holding
her
*NL*
knees
to
steady
her
.
``
I
want
to
go
back
,
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
took
no
notice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
've
left
Mr.
Fussell
behind
,
''
said
another
;
``
and
*NL*
Angelo
,
and
Crane
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
no
woman

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
expect
a
little
of

--
Mrs.
Warrington
scratched
her
*NL*
palm
--
''
will
be
more
to
the
point
than
one
of
us
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
insurance
company
sees
to
that
,
''
remarked
Charles
,
*NL*
``
and
Albert
will
do
the
talking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
go
back
,
though
,
I
say
!
''
repeated
Margaret
,
*NL*
getting
angry
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
took
no
notice
.
The
motor
,
loaded
with
*NL*
refugees
,
continued
to
travel
very
slowly
down
the
hill
.
*NL*
``
The
men
are
there
,
''
chorused
the
others
.
``
Men
will
see
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
men
CA
N'T
see
to
it
.
Oh
,
this
is
ridiculous
!
*NL*
Charles
,
I
ask
you
to
stop
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stopping
's
no
good
,
''
drawled
Charles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
it
?
''
said
Margaret
,
and
jumped
straight
out
of
*NL*
the
car
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
fell
on
her
knees
,
cut
her
gloves
,
shook
her
hat
*NL*
over
her
ear
.
Cries
of
alarm
followed
her
.
``
You
've
hurt
*NL*
yourself
,
''
exclaimed
Charles
,
jumping
after
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
've
hurt
myself
!
''
she
retorted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
ask
what

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
nothing
to
ask

said
Margaret
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
hand
's
bleeding

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
in
for
a
frightful
row
from
the
pater

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
have
thought
of
that
sooner
,
Charles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
had
never
been
in
such
a
position
before
.
It
*NL*
was
a
woman
in
revolt
who
was
hobbling
away
from
him
,
and
*NL*
the
sight
was
too
strange
to
leave
any
room
for
anger
.
He
*NL*
recovered
himself
when
the
others
caught
them
up
:
their
sort
*NL*
he
understood
.
He
commanded
them
to
go
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
Albert
Fussell
was
seen
walking
towards
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
right
!
''
he
called
.
``
It
was
n't
a
dog
,
it
was
a
*NL*
cat

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
!

exclaimed
Charles
triumphantly
.
``
It
's
only
a

rotten
cat

*NL*
*NL*
``
Got
room
in
your
car

I
cut

soon

a
dog
;
the
chauffeurs
are
tackling
the
*NL*
girl

''
But
Margaret
walked
forward
steadily
.
Why
should
*NL*
the
chauffeurs
tackle
the
girl
?
Ladies
sheltering
behind
*NL*
men
,
men
sheltering
behind
servants
--
the
whole
system
's
*NL*
wrong
,
and
she
must
challenge
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Schlegel
!

Pon
my

you
've
hurt
your
hand

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

Margaret
.
``
Do

*NL*
wait

Mr.
Fussell

*NL*
*NL*
The
second
motor
came
round
the
corner
.
``
lt
is
all
*NL*
right

said
Crane
in
his
turn

He
had
taken

calling
her
madam

*NL*
``
What

*NL*
``
Yes

The

*NL*
*NL*
``
She

ruda

said
Angelo
from
the
third

motor
thoughtfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
n't

been
rude

The
Italian
spread
out
his
hands
,
implying
that
he
had
*NL*
not
thought
of
rudeness
,
but
would
produce
it
if
it
pleased
*NL*
her
.
The
situation
became
absurd
.
The
gentlemen
were
again
*NL*
buzzing
round
Miss
Schlegel
with
offers
of
assistance
,
and
*NL*
Lady
Edser
began
to
bind
up
her
hand
.
She
yielded
,
*NL*
apologizing
slightly
,
and
was
led
back
to
the
car
,
and
soon
*NL*
the
landscape
resumed
its
motion
,
the
lonely
cottage
*NL*
disappeared
,
the
castle
swelled
on
its
cushion
of
turf
,
and
*NL*
they
had
arrived
.
No
doubt
she
had
disgraced
herself
.
But
*NL*
she
felt
their
whole
journey
from
London
had
been
unreal
.
*NL*
They
had
no
part
with
the
earth
and
its
emotions
.
They
were
*NL*
dust
,
and
a
stink
,
and
cosmopolitan
chatter
,
and
the
girl
*NL*
whose
cat
had
been
killed
had
lived
more
deeply
than
they
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Henry
,
''
she
exclaimed
,
``
I
have
been
so
naughty
,
''
*NL*
for
she
had
decided
to
take
up
this
line
.
``
We
ran
over
a
*NL*
cat
.
Charles
told
me
not
to
jump
out
,
but
I
would
,
and
*NL*
look
!
''
She
held
out
her
bandaged
hand
.
``
Your
poor
Meg
went
*NL*
such
a
flop
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Wilcox
looked
bewildered
.
In
evening
dress
,
he
was
*NL*
standing
to
welcome
his
guests
in
the
hall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thinking
it
was
a
dog
,
''
added
Mrs.
Warrington
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
a
dog
's
a
companion
!
''
said
Colonel
Fussell
.
``
A
*NL*
dog
'll
remember
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
hurt
yourself
,
Margaret
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
to
speak
about
;
and
it
's
my
left
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
hurry
up
and
change
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
obeyed
,
as
did
the
others
.
Mr.
Wilcox
then
turned
*NL*
to
his
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Charles
,
what
's
happened
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
was
absolutely
honest
.
He
described
what
he
*NL*
believed
to
have
happened
.
Albert
had
flattened
out
a
cat
,
*NL*
and
Miss
Schlegel
had
lost
her
nerve
,
as
any
woman
might
.
*NL*
She
had
been
got
safely
into
the
other
car
,
but
when
it
was
*NL*
in
motion
had
leapt
out
--
again
,
in
spite
of
all
that
they
*NL*
could
say
.
After
walking
a
little
on
the
road
,
she
had
*NL*
calmed
down
and
had
said
that
she
was
sorry
.
His
father
*NL*
accepted
this
explanation
,
and
neither
knew
that
Margaret
*NL*
had
artfully
prepared
the
way
for
it
.
It
fitted
in
too
well
*NL*
with
their
view
of
feminine
nature
.
In
the
smoking-room
,
*NL*
after
dinner
,
the
Colonel
put
forward
the
view
that
Miss
*NL*
Schlegel
had
jumped
it
out
of
devilry
.
Well
he
remembered
*NL*
as
a
young
man
,
in
the
harbour
of
Gibraltar
once
,
how
a
*NL*
girl
--
a
handsome
girl
,
too
--
had
jumped
overboard
for
a
bet
.
*NL*
He
could
see
her
now
,
and
all
the
lads
overboard
after
her
.
*NL*
But
Charles
and
Mr.
Wilcox
agreed
it
was
much
more
probably
*NL*
nerves
in
Miss
Schlegel
's
case
.
Charles
was
depressed
.
*NL*
That
woman
had
a
tongue
.
She
would
bring
worse
disgrace
on
*NL*
his
father
before
she
had
done
with
them
.
He
strolled
out
*NL*
on
to
the
castle
mound
to
think
the
matter
over
.
The
*NL*
evening
was
exquisite
.
On
three
sides
of
him
a
little
river
*NL*
whispered
,
full
of
messages
from
the
west
;
above
his
head
*NL*
the
ruins
made
patterns
against
the
sky
.
He
carefully
*NL*
reviewed
their
dealings
with
this
family
,
until
he
fitted
*NL*
Helen
,
and
Margaret
,
and
Aunt
Juley
into
an
orderly
*NL*
conspiracy
.
Paternity
had
made
him
suspicious
.
He
had
two
*NL*
children
to
look
after
,
and
more
coming
,
and
day
by
day
they
*NL*
seemed
less
likely
to
grow
up
rich
men
.
``
It
is
all
very
*NL*
well
,
''
he
reflected
,
``
the
pater
saying
that
he
will
be
just
*NL*
to
all
,
but
one
ca
n't
be
just
indefinitely
.
Money
is
n't
*NL*
elastic
.
What
's
to
happen
if
Evie
has
a
family
?
And
,
come
*NL*
to
that
,
so
may
the
pater
.
There
'll
not
be
enough
to
go
*NL*
round
,
for
there
's
none
coming
in
,
either
through
Dolly
or
*NL*
Percy
.
It
's
damnable
!
''
He
looked
enviously
at
the
Grange
,
*NL*
whose
windows
poured
light
and
laughter
.
First
and
last
,
*NL*
this
wedding
would
cost
a
pretty
penny
.
Two
ladies
were
*NL*
strolling
up
and
down
the
garden
terrace
,
and
as
the
*NL*
syllables
``
Imperialism
''
were
wafted
to
his
ears
,
he
guessed
*NL*
that
one
of
them
was
his
aunt
.
She
might
have
helped
him
,
*NL*
if
she
too
had
not
had
a
family
to
provide
for
.
``
Every
one
*NL*
for
himself
,
''
he
repeated
--
a
maxim
which
had
cheered
him
in
*NL*
the
past
,
but
which
rang
grimly
enough
among
the
ruins
of
*NL*
Oniton
.
He
lacked
his
father
's
ability
in
business
,
and
so
*NL*
had
an
ever
higher
regard
for
money
;
unless
he
could
inherit
*NL*
plenty
,
he
feared
to
leave
his
children
poor
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
sat
thinking
,
one
of
the
ladies
left
the
terrace
*NL*
and
walked
into
the
meadow
;
he
recognized
her
as
Margaret
by
*NL*
the
white
bandage
that
gleamed
on
her
arm
,
and
put
out
his
*NL*
cigar
,
lest
the
gleam
should
betray
him
.
She
climbed
up
the
*NL*
mound
in
zigzags
,
and
at
times
stooped
down
,
as
if
she
was
*NL*
stroking
the
turf
.
It
sounds
absolutely
incredible
,
but
for
*NL*
a
moment
Charles
thought
that
she
was
in
love
with
him
,
and
*NL*
had
come
out
to
tempt
him
.
Charles
believed
in
temptresses
,
*NL*
who
are
indeed
the
strong
man
's
necessary
complement
,
and
*NL*
having
no
sense
of
humour
,
he
could
not
purge
himself
of
the
*NL*
thought
by
a
smile
.
Margaret
,
who
was
engaged
to
his
*NL*
father
,
and
his
sister
's
wedding-guest
,
kept
on
her
way
*NL*
without
noticing
him
,
and
he
admitted
that
he
had
wronged
*NL*
her
on
this
point
.
But
what
was
she
doing
?
Why
was
she
*NL*
stumbling
about
amongst
the
rubble
and
catching
her
dress
in
*NL*
brambles
and
burrs
?
As
she
edged
round
the
keep
,
she
must
*NL*
have
got
to
leeward
and
smelt
his
cigar-smoke
,
for
she
*NL*
exclaimed
,
``
Hullo
!
Who
's
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
made
no
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Saxon
or
Kelt
?
''
she
continued
,
laughing
in
the
*NL*
darkness
.
``
But
it
does
n't
matter
.
Whichever
you
are
,
you
*NL*
will
have
to
listen
to
me
.
I
love
this
place
.
I
love
*NL*
Shropshire
.
I
hate
London
.
I
am
glad
that
this
will
be
my
*NL*
home
.
Ah
,
dear
''
--
she
was
now
moving
back
towards
the
*NL*
house
--
``
what
a
comfort
to
have
arrived
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
woman
means
mischief
,
''
thought
Charles
,
and
*NL*
compressed
his
lips
.
In
a
few
minutes
he
followed
her
*NL*
indoors
,
as
the
ground
was
getting
damp
.
Mists
were
rising
*NL*
from
the
river
,
and
presently
it
became
invisible
,
though
it
*NL*
whispered
more
loudly
.
There
had
been
a
heavy
downpour
in
*NL*
the
Welsh
hills
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
26
*NL*
*NL*
Next
morning
a
fine
mist
covered
the
peninsula
.
The
weather
*NL*
promised
well
,
and
the
outline
of
the
castle
mound
grew
*NL*
clearer
each
moment
that
Margaret
watched
it
.
Presently
she
*NL*
saw
the
keep
,
and
the
sun
painted
the
rubble
gold
,
and
*NL*
charged
the
white
sky
with
blue
.
The
shadow
of
the
house
*NL*
gathered
itself
together
and
fell
over
the
garden
.
A
cat
*NL*
looked
up
at
her
window
and
mewed
.
Lastly
the
river
*NL*
appeared
,
still
holding
the
mists
between
its
banks
and
its
*NL*
overhanging
alders
,
and
only
visible
as
far
as
a
hill
,
which
*NL*
cut
off
its
upper
reaches
.
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
was
fascinated
by
Oniton
.
She
had
said
that
*NL*
she
loved
it
,
but
it
was
rather
its
romantic
tension
that
*NL*
held
her
.
The
rounded
Druids
of
whom
she
had
caught
*NL*
glimpses
in
her
drive
,
the
rivers
hurrying
down
from
them
to
*NL*
England
,
the
carelessly
modelled
masses
of
the
lower
hills
,
*NL*
thrilled
her
with
poetry
.
The
house
was
insignificant
,
but
*NL*
the
prospect
from
it
would
be
an
eternal
joy
,
and
she
*NL*
thought
of
all
the
friends
she
would
have
to
stop
in
it
,
and
*NL*
of
the
conversion
of
Henry
himself
to
a
rural
life
.
*NL*
Society
,
too
,
promised
favourably
.
The
rector
of
the
parish
*NL*
had
dined
with
them
last
night
,
and
she
found
that
he
was
a
*NL*
friend
of
her
father
's
,
and
so
knew
what
to
find
in
her
.
*NL*
She
liked
him
.
He
would
introduce
her
to
the
town
.
While
,
*NL*
on
her
other
side
,
Sir
James
Bidder
sat
,
repeating
that
she
*NL*
only
had
to
give
the
word
,
and
he
would
whip
up
the
county
*NL*
families
for
twenty
miles
round
.
Whether
Sir
James
,
who
was
*NL*
Garden
Seeds
,
had
promised
what
he
could
perform
,
she
*NL*
doubted
,
but
so
long
as
Henry
mistook
them
for
the
county
*NL*
families
when
they
did
call
,
she
was
content
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
and
Albert
Fussell
now
crossed
the
lawn
.
They
*NL*
were
going
for
a
morning
dip
,
and
a
servant
followed
them
*NL*
with
their
bathing-dresses
.
She
had
meant
to
take
a
stroll
*NL*
herself
before
breakfast
,
but
saw
that
the
day
was
still
*NL*
sacred
to
men
,
and
amused
herself
by
watching
their
*NL*
contretemps
.
In
the
first
place
the
key
of
the
bathing-shed
*NL*
could
not
be
found
.
Charles
stood
by
the
riverside
with
*NL*
folded
hands
,
tragical
,
while
the
servant
shouted
,
and
was
*NL*
misunderstood
by
another
servant
in
the
garden
.
Then
came
a
*NL*
difficulty
about
a
spring-board
,
and
soon
three
people
were
*NL*
running
backwards
and
forwards
over
the
meadow
,
with
orders
*NL*
and
counter
orders
and
recriminations
and
apologies
.
If
*NL*
Margaret
wanted
to
jump
from
a
motor-car
,
she
jumped
;
if
*NL*
Tibby
thought
paddling
would
benefit
his
ankles
,
he
paddled
;
*NL*
if
a
clerk
desired
adventure
,
he
took
a
walk
in
the
dark
.
*NL*
But
these
athletes
seemed
paralysed
.
They
could
not
bathe
*NL*
without
their
appliances
,
though
the
morning
sun
was
calling
*NL*
and
the
last
mists
were
rising
from
the
dimpling
stream
.
*NL*
Had
they
found
the
life
of
the
body
after
all
?
Could
not
*NL*
the
men
whom
they
despised
as
milksops
beat
them
,
even
on
*NL*
their
own
ground
?
*NL*
*NL*
She
thought
of
the
bathing
arrangements
as
they
should
*NL*
be
in
her
day
--
no
worrying
of
servants
,
no
appliances
,
*NL*
beyond
good
sense
.
Her
reflections
were
disturbed
by
the
*NL*
quiet
child
,
who
had
come
out
to
speak
to
the
cat
,
but
was
*NL*
now
watching
her
watch
the
men
.
She
called
,
``
Good-morning
,
*NL*
dear
,
''
a
little
sharply
.
Her
voice
spread
consternation
.
*NL*
Charles
looked
round
,
and
though
completely
attired
in
*NL*
indigo
blue
,
vanished
into
the
shed
,
and
was
seen
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Wilcox
is
up
--
''
the
child
whispered
,
and
then
*NL*
became
unintelligible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
sounded
like
,
''
--
cut-yoke
--
sack
back
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
hear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
--
On
the
bed
--
tissue-paper
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gathering
that
the
wedding-dress
was
on
view
,
and
that
a
*NL*
visit
would
be
seemly
,
she
went
to
Evie
's
room
.
All
was
*NL*
hilarity
here
.
Evie
,
in
a
petticoat
,
was
dancing
with
one
*NL*
of
the
Anglo-Indian
ladies
,
while
the
other
was
adoring
*NL*
yards
of
white
satin
.
They
screamed
,
they
laughed
,
they
*NL*
sang
,
and
the
dog
barked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
screamed
a
little
too
,
but
without
conviction
.
*NL*
She
could
not
feel
that
a
wedding
was
so
funny
.
Perhaps
*NL*
something
was
missing
in
her
equipment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Evie
gasped
:
``
Dolly
is
a
rotter
not
to
be
here
!
Oh
,
we
*NL*
would
rag
just
then
!
''
Then
Margaret
went
down
to
breakfast
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henry
was
already
installed
;
he
ate
slowly
and
spoke
*NL*
little
,
and
was
,
in
Margaret
's
eyes
,
the
only
member
of
*NL*
their
party
who
dodged
emotion
successfully
.
She
could
not
*NL*
suppose
him
indifferent
either
to
the
loss
of
his
daughter
*NL*
or
to
the
presence
of
his
future
wife
.
Yet
he
dwelt
intact
,
*NL*
only
issuing
orders
occasionally
--
orders
that
promoted
the
*NL*
comfort
of
his
guests
.
He
inquired
after
her
hand
;
he
set
*NL*
her
to
pour
out
the
coffee
and
Mrs.
Warrington
to
pour
out
*NL*
the
tea
.
When
Evie
came
down
there
was
a
moment
's
*NL*
awkwardness
,
and
both
ladies
rose
to
vacate
their
places
.
*NL*
``
Burton
,
''
called
Henry
,
``
serve
tea
and
coffee
from
the
*NL*
side-board
!
''
It
was
n't
genuine
tact
,
but
it
was
tact
,
of
a
*NL*
sort
--
the
sort
that
is
as
useful
as
the
genuine
,
and
saves
*NL*
even
more
situations
at
Board
meetings
.
Henry
treated
a
*NL*
marriage
like
a
funeral
,
item
by
item
,
never
raising
his
*NL*
eyes
to
the
whole
,
and
``
Death
,
where
is
thy
sting
?
Love
,
*NL*
where
is
thy
victory
?
''
one
would
exclaim
at
the
close
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
breakfast
she
claimed
a
few
words
with
him
.
It
*NL*
was
always
best
to
approach
him
formally
.
She
asked
for
the
*NL*
interview
,
because
he
was
going
on
to
shoot
grouse
tomorrow
,
*NL*
and
she
was
returning
to
Helen
in
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
dear
,
''
said
he
.
``
Of
course
,
I
have
the
*NL*
time
.
What
do
you
want
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
afraid
something
had
gone
wrong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
have
nothing
to
say
,
but
you
may
talk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Glancing
at
his
watch
,
he
talked
of
the
nasty
curve
at
*NL*
the
lych-gate
.
She
heard
him
with
interest
.
Her
surface
*NL*
could
always
respond
to
his
without
contempt
,
though
all
her
*NL*
deeper
being
might
be
yearning
to
help
him
.
She
had
*NL*
abandoned
any
plan
of
action
.
Love
is
the
best
,
and
the
*NL*
more
she
let
herself
love
him
,
the
more
chance
was
there
*NL*
that
he
would
set
his
soul
in
order
.
Such
a
moment
as
this
,
*NL*
when
they
sat
under
fair
weather
by
the
walks
of
their
*NL*
future
home
,
was
so
sweet
to
her
that
its
sweetness
would
*NL*
surely
pierce
to
him
.
Each
lift
of
his
eyes
,
each
parting
*NL*
of
the
thatched
lip
from
the
clean-shaven
,
must
prelude
the
*NL*
tenderness
that
kills
the
Monk
and
the
Beast
at
a
single
*NL*
blow
.
Disappointed
a
hundred
times
,
she
still
hoped
.
She
*NL*
loved
him
with
too
clear
a
vision
to
fear
his
cloudiness
.
*NL*
Whether
he
droned
trivialities
,
as
today
,
or
sprang
kisses
*NL*
on
her
in
the
twilight
,
she
could
pardon
him
,
she
could
respond
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
there
is
this
nasty
curve
,
''
she
suggested
,
``
could
n't
*NL*
we
walk
to
the
church
?
Not
,
of
course
,
you
and
Evie
;
but
*NL*
the
rest
of
us
might
very
well
go
on
first
,
and
that
would
*NL*
mean
fewer
carriages
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
ca
n't
have
ladies
walking
through
the
Market
*NL*
Square
.
The
Fussells
would
n't
like
it
;
they
were
awfully
*NL*
particular
at
Charles
's
wedding
.
My
--
she
--
one
of
our
party
*NL*
was
anxious
to
walk
,
and
certainly
the
church
was
just
round
*NL*
the
corner
,
and
I
should
n't
have
minded
;
but
the
Colonel
*NL*
made
a
great
point
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
men
should
n't
be
so
chivalrous
,
''
said
Margaret
thoughtfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
knew
why
not
,
but
said
that
she
did
not
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
then
announced
that
,
unless
she
had
anything
special
*NL*
to
say
,
he
must
visit
the
wine-cellar
,
and
they
went
off
*NL*
together
in
search
of
Burton
.
Though
clumsy
and
a
little
*NL*
inconvenient
,
Oniton
was
a
genuine
country
house
.
They
*NL*
clattered
down
flagged
passages
,
looking
into
room
after
*NL*
room
,
and
scaring
unknown
maids
from
the
performance
of
*NL*
obscure
duties
.
The
wedding-breakfast
must
be
in
readiness
*NL*
when
they
came
back
from
church
,
and
tea
would
be
served
in
*NL*
the
garden
.
The
sight
of
so
many
agitated
and
serious
*NL*
people
made
Margaret
smile
,
but
she
reflected
that
they
were
*NL*
paid
to
be
serious
,
and
enjoyed
being
agitated
.
Here
were
*NL*
the
lower
wheels
of
the
machine
that
was
tossing
Evie
up
*NL*
into
nuptial
glory
.
A
little
boy
blocked
their
way
with
*NL*
pig-tails
.
His
mind
could
not
grasp
their
greatness
,
and
he
*NL*
said
:
``
By
your
leave
;
let
me
pass
,
please
.
''
Henry
asked
him
*NL*
where
Burton
was
.
But
the
servants
were
so
new
that
they
*NL*
did
not
know
one
another
's
names
.
In
the
still-room
sat
the
*NL*
band
,
who
had
stipulated
for
champagne
as
part
of
their
fee
,
*NL*
and
who
were
already
drinking
beer
.
Scents
of
Araby
came
*NL*
from
the
kitchen
,
mingled
with
cries
.
Margaret
knew
what
*NL*
had
happened
there
,
for
it
happened
at
Wickham
Place
.
One
*NL*
of
the
wedding
dishes
had
boiled
over
,
and
the
cook
was
*NL*
throwing
cedar-shavings
to
hide
the
smell
.
At
last
they
*NL*
came
upon
the
butler
.
Henry
gave
him
the
keys
,
and
handed
*NL*
Margaret
down
the
cellar-stairs
.
Two
doors
were
unlocked
.
*NL*
She
,
who
kept
all
her
wine
at
the
bottom
of
the
*NL*
linen-cupboard
,
was
astonished
at
the
sight
.
``
We
shall
*NL*
never
get
through
it
!
''
she
cried
,
and
the
two
men
were
*NL*
suddenly
drawn
into
brotherhood
,
and
exchanged
smiles
.
She
*NL*
felt
as
if
she
had
again
jumped
out
of
the
car
while
it
was
moving
.
*NL*
*NL*
Certainly
Oniton
would
take
some
digesting
.
It
would
be
*NL*
no
small
business
to
remain
herself
,
and
yet
to
assimilate
*NL*
such
an
establishment
.
She
must
remain
herself
,
for
his
*NL*
sake
as
well
as
her
own
,
since
a
shadowy
wife
degrades
the
*NL*
husband
whom
she
accompanies
;
and
she
must
assimilate
for
*NL*
reasons
of
common
honesty
,
since
she
had
no
right
to
marry
a
*NL*
man
and
make
him
uncomfortable
.
Her
only
ally
was
the
power
*NL*
of
Home
.
The
loss
of
Wickham
Place
had
taught
her
more
than
*NL*
its
possession
.
Howards
End
had
repeated
the
lesson
.
She
*NL*
was
determined
to
create
new
sanctities
among
these
hills
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
visiting
the
wine-cellar
,
she
dressed
,
and
then
*NL*
came
the
wedding
,
which
seemed
a
small
affair
when
compared
*NL*
with
the
preparations
for
it
.
Everything
went
like
one
*NL*
o'clock
.
Mr.
Cahill
materialized
out
of
space
,
and
was
*NL*
waiting
for
his
bride
at
the
church
door
.
No
one
dropped
*NL*
the
ring
or
mispronounced
the
responses
,
or
trod
on
Evie
's
*NL*
train
,
or
cried
.
In
a
few
minutes
--
the
clergymen
performed
*NL*
their
duty
,
the
register
was
signed
,
and
they
were
back
in
*NL*
their
carriages
,
negotiating
the
dangerous
curve
by
the
*NL*
lych-gate
.
Margaret
was
convinced
that
they
had
not
been
*NL*
married
at
all
,
and
that
the
Norman
church
had
been
intent
*NL*
all
the
time
on
other
business
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
more
documents
to
sign
at
the
house
,
and
the
*NL*
breakfast
to
eat
,
and
then
a
few
more
people
dropped
in
for
*NL*
the
garden
party
.
There
had
been
a
great
many
refusals
,
and
*NL*
after
all
it
was
not
a
very
big
affair
--
not
as
big
as
*NL*
Margaret
's
would
be
.
She
noted
the
dishes
and
the
strips
of
*NL*
red
carpet
,
that
outwardly
she
might
give
Henry
what
was
*NL*
proper
.
But
inwardly
she
hoped
for
something
better
than
*NL*
this
blend
of
Sunday
church
and
fox-hunting
.
If
only
*NL*
someone
had
been
upset
!
But
this
wedding
had
gone
off
so
*NL*
particularly
well
--
``
quite
like
a
Durbar
''
in
the
opinion
of
*NL*
Lady
Edser
,
and
she
thoroughly
agreed
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
wasted
day
lumbered
forward
,
the
bride
and
*NL*
bridegroom
drove
off
,
yelling
with
laughter
,
and
for
the
*NL*
second
time
the
sun
retreated
towards
the
hills
of
Wales
.
*NL*
Henry
,
who
was
more
tired
than
he
owned
,
came
up
to
her
in
*NL*
the
castle
meadow
,
and
,
in
tones
of
unusual
softness
,
said
*NL*
that
he
was
pleased
.
Everything
had
gone
off
so
well
.
She
*NL*
felt
that
he
was
praising
her
,
too
,
and
blushed
;
certainly
*NL*
she
had
done
all
she
could
with
his
intractable
friends
,
and
*NL*
had
made
a
special
point
of
kowtowing
to
the
men
.
They
were
*NL*
breaking
camp
this
evening
:
only
the
Warringtons
and
quiet
*NL*
child
would
stay
the
night
,
and
the
others
were
already
*NL*
moving
towards
the
house
to
finish
their
packing
.
``
I
think
*NL*
it
did
go
off
well
,
''
she
agreed
.
``
Since
I
had
to
jump
out
*NL*
of
the
motor
,
I
'm
thankful
I
lighted
on
my
left
hand
.
I
am
*NL*
so
very
glad
about
it
,
Henry
dear
;
I
only
hope
that
the
*NL*
guests
at
ours
may
be
half
as
comfortable
.
You
must
all
*NL*
remember
that
we
have
no
practical
person
among
us
,
except
*NL*
my
aunt
,
and
she
is
not
used
to
entertainments
on
a
large
scale
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
,
''
he
said
gravely
.
``
Under
the
circumstances
,
it
*NL*
would
be
better
to
put
everything
into
the
hands
of
Harrod
's
*NL*
or
Whiteley
's
,
or
even
to
go
to
some
hotel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
desire
a
hotel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
because
--
well
,
I
must
n't
interfere
with
you
.
No
*NL*
doubt
you
want
to
be
married
from
your
old
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
old
home
's
falling
into
pieces
,
Henry
.
I
only
want
*NL*
my
new
.
Is
n't
it
a
perfect
evening
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Alexandrina
is
n't
bad
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Alexandrina
,
''
she
echoed
,
more
occupied
with
the
*NL*
threads
of
smoke
that
were
issuing
from
their
chimneys
,
and
*NL*
ruling
the
sunlit
slopes
with
parallels
of
grey
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
off
Curzon
Street
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
?
Let
's
be
married
from
off
Curzon
Street
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
turned
westward
,
to
gaze
at
the
swirling
gold
.
*NL*
Just
where
the
river
rounded
the
hill
the
sun
caught
it
.
*NL*
Fairyland
must
lie
above
the
bend
,
and
its
precious
liquid
*NL*
was
pouring
towards
them
past
Charles
's
bathing-shed
.
She
*NL*
gazed
so
long
that
her
eyes
were
dazzled
,
and
when
they
*NL*
moved
back
to
the
house
,
she
could
not
recognize
the
faces
*NL*
of
people
who
were
coming
out
of
it
.
A
parlour-maid
was
*NL*
preceding
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
are
those
people
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
callers
!
''
exclaimed
Henry
.
``
It
's
too
late
for
callers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
they
're
town
people
who
want
to
see
the
wedding
*NL*
presents
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
at
home
yet
to
townees
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
hide
among
the
ruins
,
and
if
I
can
stop
them
,
I
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
thanked
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
went
forward
,
smiling
socially
.
She
supposed
*NL*
that
these
were
unpunctual
guests
,
who
would
have
to
be
*NL*
content
with
vicarious
civility
,
since
Evie
and
Charles
were
*NL*
gone
,
Henry
tired
,
and
the
others
in
their
rooms
.
She
*NL*
assumed
the
airs
of
a
hostess
;
not
for
long
.
For
one
of
the
*NL*
group
was
Helen
--
Helen
in
her
oldest
clothes
,
and
dominated
*NL*
by
that
tense
,
wounding
excitement
that
had
made
her
a
*NL*
terror
in
their
nursery
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
she
called
.
``
Oh
,
what
's
wrong
?
Is
Tibby
ill
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Helen
spoke
to
her
two
companions
,
who
fell
back
.
Then
*NL*
she
bore
forward
furiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
starving
!
''
she
shouted
.
``
I
found
them
starving
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
?
Why
have
you
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Basts

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

moaned
Margaret
.
``
Whatever
have
you
done
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
lost
his
place

been
turned
out

bank

Yes

done
for

We
upper
classes
have
ruined

him

I
suppose
you
'll
tell
me

's
the
battle
of
life

*NL*
Starving

His
wife
is
ill

Starving

She
fainted
in
the
train
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Helen
,
are
you
mad
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps

Yes

If
you
like

I
'm
mad

But
I
've
brought

them

I
'll
stand
injustice
no
longer

I
'll
show
up
the
*NL*
wretchedness
that
lies
under
this
luxury
,
this
talk
of

impersonal
forces

this
cant
about
God
doing
what
we
're
too

slack
to
do
ourselves

*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
actually
brought
two
starving
people
from
*NL*
London
to
Shropshire
,
Helen
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Helen
was
checked
.
She
had
not
thought
of
this
,
and
her
*NL*
hysteria
abated
.
``
There
was
a
restaurant
car
on
the
train
,

*NL*
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
absurd

from
the
beginning

such

theatrical
nonsense

Yes

how

she
*NL*
repeated
,
as
anger
filled
her
,
``
bursting
in
to
Evie
's
*NL*
wedding
in
this
heartless
way

goodness

she
indicated
the
*NL*
house
--
``
servants

people
out
of

windows

explain

`
Oh
no

*NL*
``

Helen
,

ominously
calm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well

Margaret
,
who
for
all
her
wrath

was
determined
to
avoid
a
real
quarrel

``
I

``

*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
moved
towards
the
house
at
this
.
She
was

determined
not
to

Henry

going

Scotland

seeing
him

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

tomorrow

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
it
was
our
last
chance

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
do
,
Mr.
Bast
?

said
Margaret
,
trying
to
*NL*
control
her
voice
.
``
This
is
an
odd
business

What
view
do
*NL*
you
take
of
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
Mrs.
Bast
,
too
,
''
prompted
Helen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jacky
also
shook
hands
.
She
,
like
her
husband
,
was
shy
,
*NL*
and
,
furthermore
,
ill
,
and
furthermore
,
so
bestially
stupid
*NL*
that
she
could
not
grasp
what
was
happening
.
She
only
knew
*NL*
that
the
lady
had
swept
down
like
a
whirlwind
last
night
,
*NL*
had
paid
the
rent
,
redeemed
the
furniture
,
provided
them
*NL*
with
a
dinner
and
breakfast
,
and
ordered
them
to
meet
her
at
*NL*
Paddington
next
morning
.
Leonard
had
feebly
protested
,
and
*NL*
when
the
morning
came
,
had
suggested
that
they
should
n't
*NL*
go
.
But
she
,
half
mesmerized
,
had
obeyed
.
The
lady
had
*NL*
told
them
to
,
and
they
must
,
and
their
bed-sitting-room
had
*NL*
accordingly
changed
into
Paddington
,
and
Paddington
into
a
*NL*
railway
carriage
,
that
shook
,
and
grew
hot
,
and
grew
cold
,
*NL*
and
vanished
entirely
,
and
reappeared
amid
torrents
of
*NL*
expensive
scent
.
``
You
have
fainted
,
''
said
the
lady
in
an
*NL*
awe-struck
voice
.
``
Perhaps
the
air
will
do
you
good
.
''
And
*NL*
perhaps
it
had
,
for
here
she
was
,
feeling
rather
better
*NL*
among
a
lot
of
flowers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
I
do
n't
want
to
intrude
,
''
began
Leonard
,
in
*NL*
answer
to
Margaret
's
question
.
``
But
you
have
been
so
kind
*NL*
to
me
in
the
past
in
warning
me
about
the
Porphyrion
that
I
*NL*
wondered
--
why
,
I
wondered
whether

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whether
we
could
get
him
back
into
the
Porphyrion
*NL*
again

supplied
Helen
.
``
Meg

this
has
been
a
cheerful

A
bright
evening

*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
shook
her
head
and
returned
to
Mr.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't

You
left
the
Porphyrion

a
bad
concern

n't
you
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
right

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
went
into
a
bank
instead
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
you
all
that

said
Helen
;
``
and
they
reduced
*NL*
their
staff
after
he
had
been
in
a
month

now
he
's

penniless
,

I
consider
that
we

our
informant
are

directly
to
blame

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hate
all

Leonard
muttered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
you

Mr.

But
it
's
no

yourself
no

coming
here

If

you
intend
to
confront
Mr.

,

call
him
to
*NL*
account
for
a

,
you
will
make
a
very
great
mistake

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
brought
them

I
did
it
all
,

cried
Helen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
only
advise
you
to
go
at

My

put

and
it
is
kindest
to
tell
you
so

*NL*
It
's
too
late
to
get

you
'll
find
a

in
Oniton

*NL*
*NL*
``
That

Leonard

*NL*
``
You

no

seem
no

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
work
he
wants

interpreted
Helen
.
``
Ca
n't
you
see
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
said
:
``
Jacky
,
let
's
go

We
're
more

We

costing
these

pounds

pounds
*NL*
already
to
get
work
for

they
never
will

There
's

nothing

good
enough
to
do

*NL*
*NL*
``
We
would
like
to
find

Margaret
rather
*NL*
conventionally

down

a

some

back

*NL*
*NL*
But
Leonard
was
near
the
abyss
,

at
such
moments
men
*NL*
see
clearly
.
``
You
do
n't
know
what
you

he
*NL*
said

``
I
shall
never

If
rich
people
fail
at

one
profession

they
can
try
another

Not
I.
I
had
my
*NL*
groove
,
and
I
've
got
out
of
it

I
could
do
one
particular
*NL*
branch
of
insurance
in
one
particular
office
well
enough
to
*NL*
command
a
salary
,
but
that
's
all

Poetry
's
nothing

Miss

One

that
are
nothing

Your

over

once
loses
his

it

all
over

him

Their

money

always
will
be
rich

*NL*
He
ceased

*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo

you
have
something
to

Margaret

*NL*
*NL*
They
moved
to
a
long
table
behind
which
a
servant
was
*NL*
still
standing

Iced
cakes

sandwiches
innumerable
,
coffee
,
*NL*
claret-cup

champagne

remained
almost
intact

their
overfed
*NL*

could
do
no

Leonard
refused

Jacky
thought
*NL*
she
could
manage
a
little
.
Margaret
left
them
whispering
*NL*
together
and
had
a
few
more
words
with
Helen
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
said
:
``
Helen
,
I
like
Mr.

I
agree
that

I

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

Mr.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
tell
you
once
for
all

if
you
take
up
that

attitude

I
'll
do
nothing

No
doubt
you
're
right
logically

*NL*
and
are
entitled
to
say
a
great
many
scathing

Only

Helen
looked
at

sunset

quietly

in

there
*NL*
is
to
be
none

this
absurd
screaming
about

I
*NL*
have
no
use

If
it
was
only
a
question

It
's
his

grumbled
Helen

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
am
I
concerned

,
and
how

being
as
they
are

may
be
made
a

Mr.

Wilcox
hates
being
asked
favours
:
all
business
men
do

But
*NL*
I
am
going
to
ask
him

at
the
risk

a
rebuff

make
things
a

tried

As
they
parted

she

added
:

self-indulgent

I

more

Think
it
over

alter

She
rejoined
Henry
.
Fortunately
he
had
been
sitting
*NL*
down
:
these
physical
matters
were
important
.
``
Was

he
cried

preparing

Inherently
hospitable

he
protested

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

My

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
ashamed
of
her
own
diplomacy

In
dealing
with
a
*NL*
Wilcox
,
how
tempting
it
was
to
lapse
from
comradeship
,
and
*NL*
to
give
him
the
kind
of
woman
that
he
desired
!
Henry
took
*NL*
the
hint
at
once
,
and
said
:
``
Why
later
on

Tell
me
now

No
*NL*
time

``
Shall

*NL*
``
Oh

not
five
minutes

but
there
's
a
sting

it

want
you
to
find
the

some
work

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
old

*NL*
*NL*
``
Twenty-five

perhaps

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
his

*NL*
*NL*
``
Bast

said
Margaret
,
and
was
about
to
remind
him
that
*NL*
they
had
met
at
Wickham
Place
,
but
stopped
herself
.
It
had
*NL*
not
been
a
successful
meeting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
was
he
before

*NL*
*NL*
``
Dempster

Bank

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did

he
asked

still
remembering
nothing

``
They
reduced

*NL*
It
was
the
reward
of
her
tact
and
devotion
through
the
*NL*
day
.
Now
she
understood
why
some
women
prefer
influence
to
*NL*
rights
.
Mrs.
Plynlimmon
,
when
condemning
suffragettes
,
had
*NL*
said
:
``
The
woman
who
ca
n't
influence
her
husband
to
vote
the
*NL*
way
she
wants
ought
to
be
ashamed

herself

''
Margaret
had
*NL*
winced
,
but
she
was
influencing
Henry
now
,
and
though
*NL*
pleased
at
her
little
victory
,
she
knew
that
she
had
won
it
*NL*
by
the
methods
of
the
harem
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
be
glad
if
you
took
him
,
''
she
said
,
``
but
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
whether
he
's
qualified
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
do
what
I
can

But
,
Margaret
,
this
must
n't
be
*NL*
taken
as
a
precedent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca

Business

suffer

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
promise
you
he
's
the

He

he
's
rather
a
*NL*
special
case

*NL*
*NL*
``
Proteges
always
are

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
let
it
stand
at
that
.
He
rose
with
a
little
extra
*NL*
touch
of
complacency
,
and
held
out
his
hand
to
help
her
up
.
*NL*
How
wide
the
gulf
between
Henry
as
he
was
and
Henry
as
Helen
*NL*
thought
he
ought
to
be
!
And
she
herself
--
hovering
as
usual
*NL*
between
the
two
,
now
accepting
men
as
they
are
,
now
yearning
*NL*
with
her
sister
for
Truth
.
Love
and
Truth
--
their
warfare
*NL*
seems
eternal
.
Perhaps
the
whole
visible
world
rests
on
it
,
*NL*
and
if
they
were
one
,
life
itself
,
like
the
spirits
when
*NL*
Prospero
was
reconciled
to
his
brother
,
might
vanish
into
*NL*
air
,
into
thin
air

made
us
late
,
''
said
he
.
``
The
Fussells
*NL*
will
just
be
starting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
whole
she
sided
with
men
as
they
are
.
Henry
*NL*
would
save
the
Basts
as
he
had
saved
Howards
End
,
while
*NL*
Helen
and
her
friends
were
discussing
the
ethics
of
*NL*
salvation
.
His
was
a
slap-dash
method
,
but
the
world
has
*NL*
been
built
slap-dash
,
and
the
beauty
of
mountain
and
river
*NL*
and
sunset
may
be
but
the
varnish
with
which
the
unskilled
*NL*
artificer
hides
his
joins
.
Oniton
,
like
herself
,
was
*NL*
imperfect
.
Its
apple-trees
were
stunted
,
its
castle
*NL*
ruinous
.
It
,
too
,
had
suffered
in
the
border
warfare
*NL*
between
the
Anglo
Saxon
and
the
Kelt
,
between
things
as
they
*NL*
are
and
as
they
ought
to
be
.
Once
more
the
west
was
*NL*
retreating
,
once
again
the
orderly
stars
were
dotting
the
*NL*
eastern
sky
.
There
is
certainly
no
rest
for
us
on
the
*NL*
earth
.
But
there
is
happiness
,
and
as
Margaret
descended
*NL*
the
mound
on
her
lover
's
arm
,
she
felt
that
she
was
having
*NL*
her
share
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
her
annoyance
,
Mrs.
Bast
was
still
in
the
garden
;
the
*NL*
husband
and
Helen
had
left
her
there
to
finish
her
meal
*NL*
while
they
went
to
engage
rooms
.
Margaret
found
this
woman
*NL*
repellent
.
She
had
felt
,
when
shaking
her
hand
,
an
*NL*
overpowering
shame
.
She
remembered
the
motive
of
her
call
*NL*
at
Wickham
Place
,
and
smelt
again
odours
from
the
*NL*
abyss
--
odours
the
more
disturbing
because
they
were
*NL*
involuntary
.
For
there
was
no
malice
in
Jacky
.
There
she
*NL*
sat
,
a
piece
of
cake
in
one
hand
,
an
empty
champagne
glass
*NL*
in
the
other
,
doing
no
harm
to
anybody
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
overtired
,
''
Margaret
whispered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
something
else
,
''
said
Henry
.
``
This
wo
n't
do
.
I
*NL*
ca
n't
have
her
in
my
garden
in
this
state
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
she
--
''
Margaret
hesitated
to
add
``
drunk
.
''
Now
that
*NL*
she
was
going
to
marry
him
,
he
had
grown
particular
.
He
*NL*
discountenanced
risque
conversations
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henry
went
up
to
the
woman
.
She
raised
her
face
,
which
*NL*
gleamed
in
the
twilight
like
a
puff-ball
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madam
,
you
will
be
more
comfortable
at
the
hotel
,
''
he
*NL*
said
sharply
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jacky
replied
:
``
If
it
is
n't
Hen
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ne
crois
pas
que
le
mari
lui
ressemble
,
''
apologized
*NL*
Margaret
.
``
Il
est
tout
a
fait
different
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Henry
!
''
she
repeated
,
quite
distinctly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Wilcox
was
much
annoyed
.
``
I
ca
n't
congratulate
you
*NL*
on
your
proteges
,
''
he
remarked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hen
,
do
n't
go
.
You
do
love
me
,
dear
,
do
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bless
us
,
what
a
person
!
''
sighed
Margaret
,
gathering
up
*NL*
her
skirts
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jacky
pointed
with
her
cake
.
``
You
're
a
nice
boy
,
you
*NL*
are
.
''
She
yawned
.
``
There
now
,
I
love
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Henry
,
I
am
awfully
sorry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
pray
why
?
''
he
asked
,
and
looked
at
her
so
sternly
*NL*
that
she
feared
he
was
ill
.
He
seemed
more
scandalized
than
*NL*
the
facts
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
have
brought
this
down
on
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
do
n't
apologize
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
voice
continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
does
she
call
you
`
Hen
'
?
''
said
Margaret
*NL*
innocently
.
``
Has
she
ever
seen
you
before
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Seen
Hen
before
!
''
said
Jacky
.
``
Who
has
n't
seen
Hen
?
*NL*
He
's
serving
you
like
me
,
my
dear
.
These
boys
!
You
*NL*
wait
--
Still
we
love
'em
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
now
satisfied
?
''
Henry
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
began
to
grow
frightened
.
``
I
do
n't
know
what
*NL*
it
is
all
about
,
''
she
said
.
``
Let
's
come
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
thought
she
was
acting
.
He
thought
he
was
*NL*
trapped
.
He
saw
his
whole
life
crumbling
.
``
Do
n't
you
*NL*
indeed
?
''
he
said
bitingly
.
``
I
do
.
Allow
me
to
congratulate
*NL*
you
on
the
success
of
your
plan
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
Helen
's
plan
,
not
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
now
understand
your
interest
in
the
Basts
.
Very
well
*NL*
thought
out
.
I
am
amused
at
your
caution
,
Margaret
.
You
*NL*
are
quite
right
--
it
was
necessary
.
I
am
a
man
,
and
have
*NL*
lived
a
man
's
past
.
I
have
the
honour
to
release
you
from
*NL*
your
engagement
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Still
she
could
not
understand
.
She
knew
of
life
's
*NL*
seamy
side
as
a
theory
;
she
could
not
grasp
it
as
a
fact
.
*NL*
More
words
from
Jacky
were
necessary
--
words
unequivocal
,
undenied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
that
--
''
burst
from
her
,
and
she
went
indoors
.
She
*NL*
stopped
herself
from
saying
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
what
?
''
asked
Colonel
Fussell
,
who
was
getting
ready
*NL*
to
start
in
the
hall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
were
saying
--
Henry
and
I
were
just
having
the
*NL*
fiercest
argument
,
my
point
being
--
''
Seizing
his
fur
coat
*NL*
from
a
footman
,
she
offered
to
help
him
on
.
He
protested
,
*NL*
and
there
was
a
playful
little
scene
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
let
me
do
that
,
''
said
Henry
,
following
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks
so
much
!
You
see
--
he
has
forgiven
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Colonel
said
gallantly
:
``
I
do
n't
expect
there
's
much
*NL*
to
forgive
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
got
into
the
car
.
The
ladies
followed
him
after
an
*NL*
interval
.
Maids
,
courier
,
and
heavier
luggage
had
been
sent
*NL*
on
earlier
by
the
branch
--
line
.
Still
chattering
,
still
*NL*
thanking
their
host
and
patronizing
their
future
hostess
,
*NL*
the
guests
were
home
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Margaret
continued
:
``
So
that
woman
has
been
your
mistress
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
put
it
with
your
usual
delicacy
,
''
he
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
,
please
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
,
please
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ten
years
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
left
him
without
a
word
.
For
it
was
not
her
*NL*
tragedy
:
it
was
Mrs.
Wilcox
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
27
*NL*
*NL*
Helen
began
to
wonder
why
she
had
spent
a
matter
of
eight
*NL*
pounds
in
making
some
people
ill
and
others
angry
.
Now
that
*NL*
the
wave
of
excitement
was
ebbing
,
and
had
left
her
,
Mr.
*NL*
Bast
,
and
Mrs.
Bast
stranded
for
the
night
in
a
Shropshire
*NL*
hotel
,
she
asked
herself
what
forces
had
made
the
wave
*NL*
flow
.
At
all
events
,
no
harm
was
done
.
Margaret
would
play
*NL*
the
game
properly
now
,
and
though
Helen
disapproved
of
her
*NL*
sister
's
methods
,
she
knew
that
the
Basts
would
benefit
by
*NL*
them
in
the
long
run
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Wilcox
is
so
illogical
,
''
she
explained
to
Leonard
,
*NL*
who
had
put
his
wife
to
bed
,
and
was
sitting
with
her
in
the
*NL*
empty
coffee-room
.
``
If
we
told
him
it
was
his
duty
to
take
*NL*
you
on
,
he
might
refuse
to
do
it
.
The
fact
is
,
he
is
n't
*NL*
properly
educated
.
I
do
n't
want
to
set
you
against
him
,
but
*NL*
you
'll
find
him
a
trial
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
never
thank
you
sufficiently
,
Miss
Schlegel
,
''
was
*NL*
all
that
Leonard
felt
equal
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
in
personal
responsibility
.
Do
n't
you
?
And
*NL*
in
personal
everything
.
I
hate
--
I
suppose
I
ought
n't
to
say
*NL*
that
--
but
the
Wilcoxes
are
on
the
wrong
tack
surely
.
Or
*NL*
perhaps
it
is
n't
their
fault
.
Perhaps
the
little
thing
that
*NL*
says
`
I
'
is
missing
out
of
the
middle
of
their
heads
,
and
*NL*
then
it
's
a
waste
of
time
to
blame
them
.
There
's
a
*NL*
nightmare
of
a
theory
that
says
a
special
race
is
being
born
*NL*
which
will
rule
the
rest
of
us
in
the
future
just
because
it
*NL*
lacks
the
little
thing
that
says
`
I.
'
Had
you
heard
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
get
no
time
for
reading
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Had
you
thought
it
,
then
?
That
there
are
two
kinds
of
*NL*
people
--
our
kind
,
who
live
straight
from
the
middle
of
their
*NL*
heads
,
and
the
other
kind
who
ca
n't
,
because
their
heads
*NL*
have
no
middle
?
They
ca
n't
say
`
I.
'
They
ARE
N'T
in
fact
,
*NL*
and
so
they
're
supermen
.
Pierpont
Morgan
has
never
said
`
I
'
*NL*
in
his
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Leonard
roused
himself
.
If
his
benefactress
wanted
*NL*
intellectual
conversation
,
she
must
have
it
.
She
was
more
*NL*
important
than
his
ruined
past
.
``
I
never
got
on
to
*NL*
Nietzsche
,
''
he
said
.
``
But
I
always
understood
that
those
*NL*
supermen
were
rather
what
you
may
call
egoists
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
that
's
wrong
,
''
replied
Helen
.
``
No
superman
*NL*
ever
said
'
I
want
,
'
because
'
I
want
'
must
lead
to
the
*NL*
question
,
`
Who
am
I
?
'
and
so
to
Pity
and
to
Justice
.
He
*NL*
only
says
`
want
.
'
`
Want
Europe
,
'
if
he
's
Napoleon
;
`
want
*NL*
wives
,
'
if
he
's
Bluebeard
;
`
want
Botticelli
,
'
if
he
's
*NL*
Pierpont
Morgan
.
Never
the
`
I
'
;
and
if
you
could
pierce
*NL*
through
him
,
you
'd
find
panic
and
emptiness
in
the
middle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Leonard
was
silent
for
a
moment
.
Then
he
said
:
``
May
I
*NL*
take
it
,
Miss
Schlegel
,
that
you
and
I
are
both
the
sort
*NL*
that
say
`
I
'
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
your
sister
too
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
''
repeated
Helen
,
a
little
sharply
.
She
was
*NL*
annoyed
with
Margaret
,
but
did
not
want
her
discussed
.
``
All
*NL*
presentable
people
say
`
I.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
Mr.
Wilcox
--
he
is
not
perhaps
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
that
it
's
any
good
discussing
Mr.
Wilcox
either
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
so
,
quite
so
,
''
he
agreed
.
Helen
asked
herself
*NL*
why
she
had
snubbed
him
.
Once
or
twice
during
the
day
she
*NL*
had
encouraged
him
to
criticize
,
and
then
had
pulled
him
up
*NL*
short
.
Was
she
afraid
of
him
presuming
?
If
so
,
it
was
*NL*
disgusting
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
was
thinking
the
snub
quite
natural
.
Everything
*NL*
she
did
was
natural
,
and
incapable
of
causing
offence
.
*NL*
While
the
Miss
Schlegels
were
together
he
had
felt
them
*NL*
scarcely
human
--
a
sort
of
admonitory
whirligig
.
But
a
Miss
*NL*
Schlegel
alone
was
different
.
She
was
in
Helen
's
case
*NL*
unmarried
,
in
Margaret
's
about
to
be
married
,
in
neither
*NL*
case
an
echo
of
her
sister
.
A
light
had
fallen
at
last
into
*NL*
this
rich
upper
world
,
and
he
saw
that
it
was
full
of
men
*NL*
and
women
,
some
of
whom
were
more
friendly
to
him
than
*NL*
others
.
Helen
had
become
``
his
''
Miss
Schlegel
,
who
scolded
*NL*
him
and
corresponded
with
him
,
and
had
swept
down
yesterday
*NL*
with
grateful
vehemence
.
Margaret
,
though
not
unkind
,
was
*NL*
severe
and
remote
.
He
would
not
presume
to
help
her
,
for
*NL*
instance
.
He
had
never
liked
her
,
and
began
to
think
that
*NL*
his
original
impression
was
true
,
and
that
her
sister
did
*NL*
not
like
her
either
.
Helen
was
certainly
lonely
.
She
,
who
*NL*
gave
away
so
much
,
was
receiving
too
little
.
Leonard
was
*NL*
pleased
to
think
that
he
could
spare
her
vexation
by
holding
*NL*
his
tongue
and
concealing
what
he
knew
about
Mr.
Wilcox
.
*NL*
Jacky
had
announced
her
discovery
when
he
fetched
her
from
*NL*
the
lawn
.
After
the
first
shock
,
he
did
not
mind
for
*NL*
himself
.
By
now
he
had
no
illusions
about
his
wife
,
and
*NL*
this
was
only
one
new
stain
on
the
face
of
a
love
that
had
*NL*
never
been
pure
.
To
keep
perfection
perfect
,
that
should
be
*NL*
his
ideal
,
if
the
future
gave
him
time
to
have
ideals
.
*NL*
Helen
,
and
Margaret
for
Helen
's
sake
,
must
not
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
Helen
disconcerted
him
by
fuming
the
conversation
to
his
*NL*
wife
.
``
Mrs.
Bast
--
does
she
ever
say
`
I
'
?
''
she
asked
,
half
*NL*
mischievously
,
and
then
,
``
Is
she
very
tired
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
better
she
stops
in
her
room
,
''
said
Leonard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
sit
up
with
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
thank
you
;
she
does
not
need
company
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Bast
,
what
kind
of
woman
is
your
wife
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Leonard
blushed
up
to
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ought
to
know
my
ways
by
now
.
Does
that
question
*NL*
offend
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
oh
no
,
Miss
Schlegel
,
no
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
love
honesty
.
Do
n't
pretend
your
marriage
*NL*
has
been
a
happy
one
.
You
and
she
can
have
nothing
in
common
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
deny
it
,
but
said
shyly
:
``
I
suppose
that
's
*NL*
pretty
obvious
;
but
Jacky
never
meant
to
do
anybody
any
*NL*
harm
.
When
things
went
wrong
,
or
I
heard
things
,
I
used
to
*NL*
think
it
was
her
fault
,
but
,
looking
back
,
it
's
more
mine
.
*NL*
I
need
n't
have
married
her
,
but
as
I
have
I
must
stick
to
*NL*
her
and
keep
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
long
have
you
been
married
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nearly
three
years
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
your
people
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
will
not
have
anything
to
do
with
us
.
They
had
a
*NL*
sort
of
family
council
when
they
heard
I
was
married
,
and
*NL*
cut
us
off
altogether
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Helen
began
to
pace
up
and
down
the
room
.
``
My
good
boy
,
*NL*
what
a
mess
!
''
she
said
gently
.
``
Who
are
your
people
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
answer
this
.
His
parents
,
who
were
dead
,
had
*NL*
been
in
trade
;
his
sisters
had
married
commercial
*NL*
travellers
;
his
brother
was
a
lay-reader
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
your
grandparents
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Leonard
told
her
a
secret
that
he
had
held
shameful
up
*NL*
to
now
.
``
They
were
just
nothing
at
all
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
''
--
agricultural
labourers
and
that
sort
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
!
From
which
part
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lincolnshire
mostly
,
but
my
mother
's
father
--
he
,
oddly
*NL*
enough
,
came
from
these
parts
round
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
this
very
Shropshire
.
Yes
,
that
is
odd
.
My
*NL*
mother
's
people
were
Lancashire
.
But
why
do
your
brother
*NL*
and
your
sisters
object
to
Mrs.
Bast
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
you
do
know
.
I
am
not
a
baby
.
I
can
bear
*NL*
anything
you
tell
me
,
and
the
more
you
tell
the
more
I
shall
*NL*
be
able
to
help
.
Have
they
heard
anything
against
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
have
guessed
now
,
''
said
Helen
very
gravely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
so
,
Miss
Schlegel
;
I
hope
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
be
honest
,
even
over
these
things
.
I
have
*NL*
guessed
.
I
am
frightfully
,
dreadfully
sorry
,
but
it
does
*NL*
not
make
the
least
difference
to
me
.
I
shall
feel
just
the
*NL*
same
to
both
of
you
.
I
blame
,
not
your
wife
for
these
*NL*
things
,
but
men
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Leonard
left
it
at
that
--
so
long
as
she
did
not
guess
*NL*
the
man
.
She
stood
at
the
window
and
slowly
pulled
up
the
*NL*
blinds
.
The
hotel
looked
over
a
dark
square
.
The
mists
had
*NL*
begun
.
When
she
turned
back
to
him
her
eyes
were
shining
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
worry
,
''
he
pleaded
.
``
I
ca
n't
bear
that
.
We
*NL*
shall
be
all
right
if
I
get
work
.
If
I
could
only
get
*NL*
work
--
something
regular
to
do
.
Then
it
would
n't
be
so
bad
*NL*
again
.
I
do
n't
trouble
after
books
as
I
used
.
I
can
*NL*
imagine
that
with
regular
work
we
should
settle
down
again
.
*NL*
It
stops
one
thinking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Settle
down
to
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
just
settle
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
's
to
be
life
!
''
said
Helen
,
with
a
catch
in
her
*NL*
throat
.
``
How
can
you
,
with
all
the
beautiful
things
to
see
*NL*
and
do
--
with
music
--
with
walking
at
night
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Walking
is
well
enough
when
a
man
's
in
work
,
''
he
*NL*
answered
.
``
Oh
,
I
did
talk
a
lot
of
nonsense
once
,
but
*NL*
there
's
nothing
like
a
bailiff
in
the
house
to
drive
it
out
*NL*
of
you
.
When
I
saw
him
fingering
my
Ruskins
and
Stevensons
,
*NL*
I
seemed
to
see
life
straight
real
,
and
it
is
n't
a
pretty
*NL*
sight
.
My
books
are
back
again
,
thanks
to
you
,
but
they
'll
*NL*
never
be
the
same
to
me
again
,
and
I
sha
n't
ever
again
think
*NL*
night
in
the
woods
is
wonderful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
''
asked
Helen
,
throwing
up
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
see
one
must
have
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
're
wrong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
I
was
wrong
,
but
--
the
clergyman
--
he
has
money
of
*NL*
his
own
,
or
else
he
's
paid
;
the
poet
or
the
musician
--
just
*NL*
the
same
;
the
tramp
--
he
's
no
different
.
The
tramp
goes
to
*NL*
the
workhouse
in
the
end
,
and
is
paid
for
with
other
*NL*
people
's
money
.
Miss
Schlegel
,
the
real
thing
's
money
and
*NL*
all
the
rest
is
a
dream
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
still
wrong
.
You
've
forgotten
Death
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Leonard
could
not
understand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
we
lived
for
ever
what
you
say
would
be
true
.
But
*NL*
we
have
to
die
,
we
have
to
leave
life
presently
.
Injustice
*NL*
and
greed
would
be
the
real
thing
if
we
lived
for
ever
.
As
*NL*
it
is
,
we
must
hold
to
other
things
,
because
Death
is
*NL*
coming
.
I
love
Death
--
not
morbidly
,
but
because
He
*NL*
explains
.
He
shows
me
the
emptiness
of
Money
.
Death
and
*NL*
Money
are
the
eternal
foes
.
Not
Death
and
Life
.
Never
mind
*NL*
what
lies
behind
Death
,
Mr.
Bast
,
but
be
sure
that
the
poet
*NL*
and
the
musician
and
the
tramp
will
be
happier
in
it
than
*NL*
the
man
who
has
never
learnt
to
say
,

I
am
I.

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
all
in
a
mist
--
I
know
but
I
can
help
you
this
*NL*
far
--
men
like
the
Wilcoxes
are
deeper
in
the
mist
than
any

*NL*
Sane
,
sound
Englishmen
!
building
up
empires
,
levelling
all
*NL*
the
world
into
what
they
call
common
sense
.
But
mention
*NL*
Death
to
them
and
they
're
offended
,
because
Death
's
really
*NL*
Imperial
,
and
He
cries
out
against
them
for
ever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
as
afraid
of
Death
as
any
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
not
of
the
idea
of
Death
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
is
the
difference
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Infinite
difference
,
''
said
Helen
,
more
gravely
than
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leonard
looked
at
her
wondering
,
and
had
the
sense
of
*NL*
great
things
sweeping
out
of
the
shrouded
night
.
But
he
*NL*
could
not
receive
them
,
because
his
heart
was
still
full
of
*NL*
little
things
.
As
the
lost
umbrella
had
spoilt
the
concert
*NL*
at
Queen
's
Hall
,
so
the
lost
situation
was
obscuring
the
*NL*
diviner
harmonies
now
.
Death
,
Life
and
Materialism
were
*NL*
fine
words
,
but
would
Mr.
Wilcox
take
him
on
as
a
clerk
?
*NL*
Talk
as
one
would
,
Mr.
Wilcox
was
king
of
this
world
,
the
*NL*
superman
,
with
his
own
morality
,
whose
head
remained
in
the
clouds
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
be
stupid
,
''
he
said
apologetically
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
to
Helen
the
paradox
became
clearer
and
clearer
.
*NL*
``
Death
destroys
a
man
:
the
idea
of
Death
saves
him
.
''
Behind
*NL*
the
coffins
and
the
skeletons
that
stay
the
vulgar
mind
lies
*NL*
something
so
immense
that
all
that
is
great
in
us
responds
*NL*
to
it
.
Men
of
the
world
may
recoil
from
the
charnel-house
*NL*
that
they
will
one
day
enter
,
but
Love
knows
better
.
Death
*NL*
is
his
foe
,
but
his
peer
,
and
in
their
age-long
struggle
the
*NL*
thews
of
Love
have
been
strengthened
,
and
his
vision
*NL*
cleared
,
until
there
is
no
one
who
can
stand
against
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
never
give
in
,
''
continued
the
girl
,
and
restated
*NL*
again
and
again
the
vague
yet
convincing
plea
that
the
*NL*
Invisible
lodges
against
the
Visible
.
Her
excitement
grew
*NL*
as
she
tried
to
cut
the
rope
that
fastened
Leonard
to
the
*NL*
earth
.
Woven
of
bitter
experience
,
it
resisted
her
.
*NL*
Presently
the
waitress
entered
and
gave
her
a
letter
from
*NL*
Margaret
.
Another
note
,
addressed
to
Leonard
,
was
inside
.
*NL*
They
read
them
,
listening
to
the
murmurings
of
the
river
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
28
*NL*
*NL*
For
many
hours
Margaret
did
nothing
;
then
she
controlled
*NL*
herself
,
and
wrote
some
letters
.
She
was
too
bruised
to
*NL*
speak
to
Henry
;
she
could
pity
him
,
and
even
determine
to
*NL*
marry
him
,
but
as
yet
all
lay
too
deep
in
her
heart
for
*NL*
speech
.
On
the
surface
the
sense
of
his
degradation
was
too
*NL*
strong
.
She
could
not
command
voice
or
look
,
and
the
gentle
*NL*
words
that
she
forced
out
through
her
pen
seemed
to
proceed
*NL*
from
some
other
person
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dearest
boy
,
''
she
began
,
``
this
is
not
to
part
us
.
*NL*
It
is
everything
or
nothing
,
and
I
mean
it
to
be
nothing
.
*NL*
It
happened
long
before
we
ever
met
,
and
even
if
it
had
*NL*
happened
since
,
I
should
be
writing
the
same
,
I
hope
.
I
do
*NL*
understand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
crossed
out
``
I
do
understand
''
;
it
struck
a
false
*NL*
note
.
Henry
could
not
bear
to
be
understood
.
She
also
*NL*
crossed
out
,
``
It
is
everything
or
nothing
.
``
Henry
would
*NL*
resent
so
strong
a
grasp
of
the
situation
.
She
must
not
*NL*
comment
;
comment
is
unfeminine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
that
'll
about
do
,
''
she
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
sense
of
his
degradation
choked
her
.
Was
he
*NL*
worth
all
this
bother
?
To
have
yielded
to
a
woman
of
that
*NL*
sort
was
everything
,
yes
,
it
was
,
and
she
could
not
be
his
*NL*
wife
.
She
tried
to
translate
his
temptation
into
her
own
*NL*
language
,
and
her
brain
reeled
.
Men
must
be
different
,
even
*NL*
to
want
to
yield
to
such
a
temptation
.
Her
belief
in
*NL*
comradeship
was
stifled
,
and
she
saw
life
as
from
that
glass
*NL*
saloon
on
the
Great
Western
,
which
sheltered
male
and
female
*NL*
alike
from
the
fresh
air
.
Are
the
sexes
really
races
,
each
*NL*
with
its
own
code
of
morality
,
and
their
mutual
love
a
mere
*NL*
device
of
Nature
to
keep
things
going
?
Strip
human
*NL*
intercourse
of
the
proprieties
,
and
is
it
reduced
to
this
?
*NL*
Her
judgment
told
her
no
.
She
knew
that
out
of
Nature
's
*NL*
device
we
have
built
a
magic
that
will
win
us
immortality
.
*NL*
Far
more
mysterious
than
the
call
of
sex
to
sex
is
the
*NL*
tenderness
that
we
throw
into
that
call
;
far
wider
is
the
*NL*
gulf
between
us
and
the
farmyard
than
between
the
farm-yard
*NL*
and
the
garbage
that
nourishes
it
.
We
are
evolving
,
in
ways
*NL*
that
Science
can
not
measure
,
to
ends
that
Theology
dares
not
*NL*
contemplate
.
``
Men
did
produce
one
jewel
,
''
the
gods
will
*NL*
say
,
and
,
saying
,
will
give
us
immortality
.
Margaret
knew
*NL*
all
this
,
but
for
the
moment
she
could
not
feel
it
,
and
*NL*
transformed
the
marriage
of
Evie
and
Mr.
Cahill
into
a
*NL*
carnival
of
fools
,
and
her
own
marriage
--
too
miserable
to
*NL*
think
of
that
,
she
tore
up
the
letter
,
and
then
wrote
*NL*
another
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Dear
Mr.
Bast
,
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
spoken
to
Mr.
Wilcox
about
you
,
as
I
promised
,
*NL*
and
am
sorry
to
say
that
he
has
no
vacancy
for
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yours
truly
,
*NL*
M.
J.
Schlegel
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
She
enclosed
this
in
a
note
to
Helen
,
over
which
she
*NL*
took
less
trouble
than
she
might
have
done
;
but
her
head
was
*NL*
aching
,
and
she
could
not
stop
to
pick
her
words
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Dear
Helen
,
*NL*
*NL*
Give
him
this
.
The
Basts
are
no
good
.
Henry
found
*NL*
the
woman
drunk
on
the
lawn
.
I
am
having
a
room
got
*NL*
ready
for
you
here
,
and
will
you
please
come
round
at
*NL*
once
on
getting
this
?
The
Basts
are
not
at
all
the
type
*NL*
we
should
trouble
about
.
I
may
go
round
to
them
myself
*NL*
in
the
morning
,
and
do
anything
that
is
fair
.
*NL*
*NL*
M
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
writing
this
,
Margaret
felt
that
she
was
being
*NL*
practical
.
Something
might
be
arranged
for
the
Basts
later
*NL*
on
,
but
they
must
be
silenced
for
the
moment
.
She
hoped
to
*NL*
avoid
a
conversation
between
the
woman
and
Helen
.
She
rang
*NL*
the
bell
for
a
servant
,
but
no
one
answered
it
;
Mr.
Wilcox
*NL*
and
the
Warringtons
were
gone
to
bed
,
and
the
kitchen
was
*NL*
abandoned
to
Saturnalia
.
Consequently
she
went
over
to
the
*NL*
George
herself
.
She
did
not
enter
the
hotel
,
for
discussion
*NL*
would
have
been
perilous
,
and
,
saying
that
the
letter
was
*NL*
important
,
she
gave
it
to
the
waitress
.
As
she
recrossed
*NL*
the
square
she
saw
Helen
and
Mr.
Bast
looking
out
of
the
*NL*
window
of
the
coffee-room
,
and
feared
she
was
already
too
*NL*
late
.
Her
task
was
not
yet
over
;
she
ought
to
tell
Henry
*NL*
what
she
had
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
came
easily
,
for
she
saw
him
in
the
hall
.
The
*NL*
night
wind
had
been
rattling
the
pictures
against
the
wall
,
*NL*
and
the
noise
had
disturbed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
there
?
''
he
called
,
quite
the
householder
.
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
walked
in
and
past
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
asked
Helen
to
sleep
,
''
she
said
.
``
She
is
best
*NL*
here
;
so
do
n't
lock
the
front-door
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
someone
had
got
in
,
''
said
Henry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
the
same
time
I
told
the
man
that
we
could
do
*NL*
nothing
for
him
.
I
do
n't
know
about
later
,
but
now
the
*NL*
Basts
must
clearly
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
say
that
your
sister
is
sleeping
here
,
after
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Probably
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
she
to
be
shown
up
to
your
room
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
naturally
nothing
to
say
to
her
;
I
am
going
to
*NL*
bed
.
Will
you
tell
the
servants
about
Helen
?
Could
someone
*NL*
go
to
carry
her
bag
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
tapped
a
little
gong
,
which
had
been
bought
to
summon
*NL*
the
servants
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
make
more
noise
than
that
if
you
want
them
to
hear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henry
opened
a
door
,
and
down
the
corridor
came
shouts
*NL*
of
laughter
.
``
Far
too
much
screaming
there
,
''
he
said
,
and
*NL*
strode
towards
it
.
Margaret
went
upstairs
,
uncertain
*NL*
whether
to
be
glad
that
they
had
met
,
or
sorry
.
They
had
*NL*
behaved
as
if
nothing
had
happened
,
and
her
deepest
*NL*
instincts
told
her
that
this
was
wrong
.
For
his
own
sake
,
*NL*
some
explanation
was
due
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
--
what
could
an
explanation
tell
her
?
A
date
,
a
*NL*
place
,
a
few
details
,
which
she
could
imagine
all
too
*NL*
clearly
.
Now
that
the
first
shock
was
over
,
she
saw
that
*NL*
there
was
every
reason
to
premise
a
Mrs.
Bast
.
Henry
's
*NL*
inner
life
had
long
laid
open
to
her
--
his
intellectual
*NL*
confusion
,
his
obtuseness
to
personal
influence
,
his
strong
*NL*
but
furtive
passions
.
Should
she
refuse
him
because
his
*NL*
outer
life
corresponded
?
Perhaps
.
Perhaps
,
if
the
*NL*
dishonour
had
been
done
to
her
,
but
it
was
done
long
before
*NL*
her
day
.
She
struggled
against
the
feeling
.
She
told
*NL*
herself
that
Mrs.
Wilcox
's
wrong
was
her
own
.
But
she
was
*NL*
not
a
bargain
theorist
.
As
she
undressed
,
her
anger
,
her
*NL*
regard
for
the
dead
,
her
desire
for
a
scene
,
all
grew
weak
.
*NL*
Henry
must
have
it
as
he
liked
,
for
she
loved
him
,
and
some
*NL*
day
she
would
use
her
love
to
make
him
a
better
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pity
was
at
the
bottom
of
her
actions
all
through
this
*NL*
crisis
.
Pity
,
if
one
may
generalize
,
is
at
the
bottom
of
*NL*
woman
.
When
men
like
us
,
it
is
for
our
better
qualities
,
*NL*
and
however
tender
their
liking
,
we
dare
not
be
unworthy
of
*NL*
it
,
or
they
will
quietly
let
us
go
.
But
unworthiness
*NL*
stimulates
woman
.
It
brings
out
her
deeper
nature
,
for
good
*NL*
or
for
evil
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
was
the
core
of
the
question
.
Henry
must
be
*NL*
forgiven
,
and
made
better
by
love
;
nothing
else
mattered
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Wilcox
,
that
unquiet
yet
kindly
ghost
,
must
be
left
to
*NL*
her
own
wrong
.
To
her
everything
was
in
proportion
now
,
and
*NL*
she
,
too
,
would
pity
the
man
who
was
blundering
up
and
down
*NL*
their
lives
.
Had
Mrs.
Wilcox
known
of
his
trespass
?
An
*NL*
interesting
question
,
but
Margaret
fell
asleep
,
tethered
by
*NL*
affection
,
and
lulled
by
the
murmurs
of
the
river
that
*NL*
descended
all
the
night
from
Wales
.
She
felt
herself
at
one
*NL*
with
her
future
home
,
colouring
it
and
coloured
by
it
,
and
*NL*
awoke
to
see
,
for
the
second
time
,
Oniton
Castle
conquering
*NL*
the
morning
mists
.

*NL*
``
Henry
dear
--
''
was
her
greeting
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
finished
his
breakfast
,
and
was
beginning
the
*NL*
TIMES
.
His
sister-in-law
was
packing
.
She
knelt
by
him
and
*NL*
took
the
paper
from
him
,
feeling
that
it
was
unusually
heavy
*NL*
and
thick
.
Then
,
putting
her
face
where
it
had
been
,
she
*NL*
looked
up
in
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Henry
dear
,
look
at
me
.
No
,
I
wo
n't
have
you
*NL*
shirking
.
Look
at
me
.
There
.
That
's
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
referring
to
last
evening
,
''
he
said
huskily
.
``
I
*NL*
have
released
you
from
your
engagement
.
I
could
find
*NL*
excuses
,
but
I
wo
n't
.
No
,
I
wo
n't
.
A
thousand
times
no
.
*NL*
I
'm
a
bad
lot
,
and
must
be
left
at
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Expelled
from
his
old
fortress
,
Mr.
Wilcox
was
building
*NL*
a
new
one
.
He
could
no
longer
appear
respectable
to
her
,
so
*NL*
he
defended
himself
instead
in
a
lurid
past
.
It
was
not
*NL*
true
repentance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
it
where
you
will
,
boy
.
It
's
not
going
to
*NL*
trouble
us
:
I
know
what
I
'm
talking
about
,
and
it
will
make
*NL*
no
difference
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
difference
?
''
he
inquired
.
``
No
difference
,
when
you
*NL*
find
that
I
am
not
the
fellow
you
thought
?
''
He
was
annoyed
*NL*
with
Miss
Schlegel
here
.
He
would
have
preferred
her
to
be
*NL*
prostrated
by
the
blow
,
or
even
to
rage
.
Against
the
tide
*NL*
of
his
sin
flowed
the
feeling
that
she
was
not
altogether
*NL*
womanly
.
Her
eyes
gazed
too
straight
;
they
had
read
books
*NL*
that
are
suitable
for
men
only
.
And
though
he
had
dreaded
a
*NL*
scene
,
and
though
she
had
determined
against
one
,
there
was
*NL*
a
scene
,
all
the
same
.
It
was
somehow
imperative
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
unworthy
of
you
,
''
he
began
.
``
Had
I
been
worthy
,
I
*NL*
should
not
have
released
you
from
your
engagement
.
I
know
*NL*
what
I
am
talking
about
.
I
ca
n't
bear
to
talk
of
such
*NL*
things
.
We
had
better
leave
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
kissed
his
hand
.
He
jerked
it
from
her
,
and
,
rising
*NL*
to
his
feet
,
went
on
:
``
You
,
with
your
sheltered
life
,
and
*NL*
refined
pursuits
,
and
friends
,
and
books
,
you
and
your
*NL*
sister
,
and
women
like
you
--
I
say
,
how
can
you
guess
the
*NL*
temptations
that
lie
round
a
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
difficult
for
us
,
''
said
Margaret
;
``
but
if
we
are
*NL*
worth
marrying
,
we
do
guess
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cut
off
from
decent
society
and
family
ties
,
what
do
*NL*
you
suppose
happens
to
thousands
of
young
fellows
overseas
?
*NL*
Isolated
.
No
one
near
.
I
know
by
bitter
experience
,
and
*NL*
yet
you
say
it
makes
`
no
difference
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
laughed
bitterly
.
Margaret
went
to
the
side-board
*NL*
and
helped
herself
to
one
of
the
breakfast
dishes
.
Being
*NL*
the
last
down
,
she
turned
out
the
spirit-lamp
that
kept
them
*NL*
warm
.
She
was
tender
,
but
grave
.
She
knew
that
Henry
was
*NL*
not
so
much
confessing
his
soul
as
pointing
out
the
gulf
*NL*
between
the
male
soul
and
the
female
,
and
she
did
not
desire
*NL*
to
hear
him
on
this
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
Helen
come
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
shook
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
that
wo
n't
do
at
all
,
at
all
!
We
do
n't
want
her
*NL*
gossiping
with
Mrs.
Bast
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
God
!
no
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
suddenly
natural
.
Then
*NL*
he
caught
himself
up
.
``
Let
them
gossip
.
My
game
's
up
,
*NL*
though
I
thank
you
for
your
unselfishness
--
little
as
my
*NL*
thanks
are
worth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
n't
she
send
me
a
message
or
anything
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
heard
of
none
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
ring
the
bell
,
please
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
to
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
to
inquire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
swaggered
up
to
it
tragically
,
and
sounded
a
peal
.
*NL*
Margaret
poured
herself
out
some
coffee
.
The
butler
came
,
*NL*
and
said
that
Miss
Schlegel
had
slept
at
the
George
,
so
far
*NL*
as
he
had
heard
.
Should
he
go
round
to
the
George
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
go
,
thank
you
,
''
said
Margaret
,
and
dismissed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
no
good
,
''
said
Henry
.
``
Those
things
leak
out
;
*NL*
you
can
not
stop
a
story
once
it
has
started
.
I
have
known
*NL*
cases
of
other
men
--
I
despised
them
once
,
I
thought
that
I
'M
*NL*
different
,
I
shall
never
be
tempted
.
Oh
,
Margaret
--
''
He
*NL*
came
and
sat
down
near
her
,
improvising
emotion
.
She
could
*NL*
not
bear
to
listen
to
him
.
``
We
fellows
all
come
to
grief
*NL*
once
in
our
time
.
Will
you
believe
that
?
There
are
moments
*NL*
when
the
strongest
man
--
`
Let
him
who
standeth
,
take
heed
*NL*
lest
he
fall
.
'
That
's
true
,
is
n't
it
?
If
you
knew
all
,
you
*NL*
would
excuse
me
.
I
was
far
from
good
influences
--
far
even
*NL*
from
England
.
I
was
very
,
very
lonely
,
and
longed
for
a
*NL*
woman
's
voice
.
That
's
enough
.
I
have
told
you
too
much
*NL*
already
for
you
to
forgive
me
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
's
enough
,
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
''
--
he
lowered
his
voice
--
``
I
have
been
through
hell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gravely
she
considered
this
claim
.
Had
he
?
Had
he
*NL*
suffered
tortures
of
remorse
,
or
had
it
been
,
``
There
!
*NL*
that
's
over
.
Now
for
respectable
life
again
''
?
The
latter
,
*NL*
if
she
read
him
rightly
.
A
man
who
has
been
through
hell
*NL*
does
not
boast
of
his
virility
.
He
is
humble
and
hides
it
,
*NL*
if
,
indeed
,
it
still
exists
.
Only
in
legend
does
the
sinner
*NL*
come
forth
penitent
,
but
terrible
,
to
conquer
pure
woman
by
*NL*
his
resistless
power
.
Henry
was
anxious
to
be
terrible
,
but
*NL*
had
not
got
it
in
him
.
He
was
a
good
average
Englishman
,
*NL*
who
had
slipped
.
The
really
culpable
point
--
his
*NL*
faithlessness
to
Mrs.
Wilcox
--
never
seemed
to
strike
him
.
*NL*
She
longed
to
mention
Mrs.
Wilcox
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
bit
by
bit
the
story
was
told
her
.
It
was
a
very
*NL*
simple
story
.
Ten
years
ago
was
the
time
,
a
garrison
town
*NL*
in
Cyprus
the
place
.
Now
and
then
he
asked
her
whether
she
*NL*
could
possibly
forgive
him
,
and
she
answered
,
``
I
have
*NL*
already
forgiven
you
,
Henry
.
''
She
chose
her
words
carefully
,
*NL*
and
so
saved
him
from
panic
.
She
played
the
girl
,
until
he
*NL*
could
rebuild
his
fortress
and
hide
his
soul
from
the
*NL*
world
.
When
the
butler
came
to
clear
away
,
Henry
was
in
a
*NL*
very
different
mood
--
asked
the
fellow
what
he
was
in
such
a
*NL*
hurry
for
,
complained
of
the
noise
last
night
in
the
*NL*
servants
'
hall
.
Margaret
looked
intently
at
the
butler
.
*NL*
He
,
as
a
handsome
young
man
,
was
faintly
attractive
to
her
*NL*
as
a
woman
--
an
attraction
so
faint
as
scarcely
to
be
*NL*
perceptible
,
yet
the
skies
would
have
fallen
if
she
had
*NL*
mentioned
it
to
Henry
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
her
return
from
the
George
the
building
operations
*NL*
were
complete
,
and
the
old
Henry
fronted
her
,
competent
,
*NL*
cynical
,
and
kind
.
He
had
made
a
clean
breast
,
had
been
*NL*
forgiven
,
and
the
great
thing
now
was
to
forget
his
failure
,
*NL*
and
to
send
it
the
way
of
other
unsuccessful
investments
.
*NL*
Jacky
rejoined
Howards
End
and
Ducie
Street
,
and
the
*NL*
vermilion
motor-car
,
and
the
Argentine
Hard
Dollars
,
and
all
*NL*
the
things
and
people
for
whom
he
had
never
had
much
use
and
*NL*
had
less
now
.
Their
memory
hampered
him
.
He
could
scarcely
*NL*
attend
to
Margaret
who
brought
back
disquieting
news
from
*NL*
the
George
.
Helen
and
her
clients
had
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
let
them
go
--
the
man
and
his
wife
,
I
mean
,
for
*NL*
the
more
we
see
of
your
sister
the
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
they
have
gone
separately
--
Helen
very
early
,
the
*NL*
Basts
just
before
I
arrived
.
They
have
left
no
message
.
*NL*
They
have
answered
neither
of
my
notes

I
do
n't
like
to
*NL*
think
what
it
all
means

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
you
say
in
the
notes
?

*NL*

``
I
told
you
last

ah

yes

Dear

would
you
like
one
turn
in

*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
took
his
arm
.
The
beautiful
weather
soothed
*NL*
her
.
But
the
wheels
of
Evie
's
wedding
were
still
at
work
,
*NL*
tossing
the
guests
outwards
as
deftly
as
they
had
drawn
them
*NL*
in
,
and
she
could
not
be
with
him
long
.
It
had
been
*NL*
arranged
that
they
should
motor
to
Shrewsbury
,
whence
he
*NL*
would
go
north
,
and
she
back
to
London
with
the
*NL*
Warringtons
.
For
a
fraction
of
time
she
was
happy
.
Then
*NL*
her
brain
recommenced
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
there
has
been
gossiping
of
some
kind
at
*NL*
the
George
.
Helen
would
not
have
left
unless
she
had
heard
*NL*
something
.
I
mismanaged
that
.
It
is
wretched
.
I
ought
*NL*
to
--
have
parted
her
from
that
woman
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Margaret
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
loosing
her
arm
impressively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
yes
,
Henry
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
far
from
a
saint
--
in
fact
,
the
reverse
--
but
you
*NL*
have
taken
me
,
for
better
or
worse
.
Bygones
must
be
*NL*
bygones
.
You
have
promised
to
forgive
me
.
Margaret
,
a
*NL*
promise
is
a
promise
.
Never
mention
that
woman
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Except
for
some
practical
reason
--
never
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Practical
!
You
practical
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
'm
practical
,
''
she
murmured
,
stooping
over
the
*NL*
mowing-machine
and
playing
with
the
grass
which
trickled
*NL*
through
her
fingers
like
sand
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
silenced
her
,
but
her
fears
made
him
uneasy
.
Not
*NL*
for
the
first
time
,
he
was
threatened
with
blackmail
.
He
*NL*
was
rich
and
supposed
to
be
moral
;
the
Basts
knew
that
he
*NL*
was
not
,
and
might
find
it
profitable
to
hint
as
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
all
events
,
you
must
n't
worry
,
''
he
said
.
``
This
is
a
*NL*
man
's
business
.
''
He
thought
intently
.
``
On
no
account
*NL*
mention
it
to
anybody
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
flushed
at
advice
so
elementary
,
but
he
was
*NL*
really
paving
the
way
for
a
lie
.
If
necessary
he
would
deny
*NL*
that
he
had
ever
known
Mrs.
Bast
,
and
prosecute
her
for
*NL*
libel
.
Perhaps
he
never
had
known
her
.
Here
was
Margaret
,
*NL*
who
behaved
as
if
he
had
not
.
There
the
house
.
Round
them
*NL*
were
half
a
dozen
gardeners
,
clearing
up
after
his
*NL*
daughter
's
wedding
.
All
was
so
solid
and
spruce
,
that
the
*NL*
past
flew
up
out
of
sight
like
a
spring-blind
,
leaving
only
*NL*
the
last
five
minutes
unrolled
.
*NL*
*NL*
Glancing
at
these
,
he
saw
that
the
car
would
be
round
*NL*
during
the
next
five
,
and
plunged
into
action
.
Gongs
were
*NL*
tapped
,
orders
issued
,
Margaret
was
sent
to
dress
,
and
the
*NL*
housemaid
to
sweep
up
the
long
trickle
of
grass
that
she
had
*NL*
left
across
the
hall
.
As
is
Man
to
the
Universe
,
so
was
the
*NL*
mind
of
Mr.
Wilcox
to
the
minds
of
some
men
--
a
concentrated
*NL*
light
upon
a
tiny
spot
,
a
little
Ten
Minutes
moving
*NL*
self-contained
through
its
appointed
years
.
No
Pagan
he
,
*NL*
who
lives
for
the
Now
,
and
may
be
wiser
than
all
*NL*
philosophers
.
He
lived
for
the
five
minutes
that
have
past
,
*NL*
and
the
five
to
come
;
he
had
the
business
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
did
he
stand
now
,
as
his
motor
slipped
out
of
Oniton
*NL*
and
breasted
the
great
round
hills
?
Margaret
had
heard
a
*NL*
certain
rumour
,
but
was
all
right
.
She
had
forgiven
him
,
*NL*
God
bless
her
,
and
he
felt
the
manlier
for
it
.
Charles
and
*NL*
Evie
had
not
heard
it
,
and
never
must
hear
.
No
more
must
*NL*
Paul
.
Over
his
children
he
felt
great
tenderness
,
which
he
*NL*
did
not
try
to
track
to
a
cause
:
Mrs.
Wilcox
was
too
far
*NL*
back
in
his
life
.
He
did
not
connect
her
with
the
sudden
*NL*
aching
love
that
he
felt
for
Evie
.
Poor
little
Evie
!
he
*NL*
trusted
that
Cahill
would
make
her
a
decent
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Margaret
?
How
did
she
stand
?
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
several
minor
worries
.
Clearly
her
sister
had
*NL*
heard
something
.
She
dreaded
meeting
her
in
town
.
And
she
*NL*
was
anxious
about
Leonard
,
for
whom
they
certainly
were
*NL*
responsible
.
Nor
ought
Mrs.
Bast
to
starve
.
But
the
main
*NL*
situation
had
not
altered
.
She
still
loved
Henry
.
His
*NL*
actions
,
not
his
disposition
,
had
disappointed
her
,
and
she
*NL*
could
bear
that
.
And
she
loved
her
future
home
.
Standing
*NL*
up
in
the
car
,
just
where
she
had
leapt
from
it
two
days
*NL*
before
,
she
gazed
back
with
deep
emotion
upon
Oniton
.
*NL*
Besides
the
Grange
and
the
Castle
keep
,
she
could
now
pick
*NL*
out
the
church
and
the
black-and-white
gables
of
the
*NL*
George
.
There
was
the
bridge
,
and
the
river
nibbling
its
*NL*
green
peninsula
.
She
could
even
see
the
bathing-shed
,
but
*NL*
while
she
was
looking
for
Charles
's
new
springboard
,
the
*NL*
forehead
of
the
hill
rose
up
and
hid
the
whole
scene
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
never
saw
it
again
.
Day
and
night
the
river
flows
*NL*
down
into
England
,
day
after
day
the
sun
retreats
into
the
*NL*
Welsh
mountains
,
and
the
tower
chimes
,
``
See
the
Conquering
*NL*
Hero
.
''
But
the
Wilcoxes
have
no
part
in
the
place
,
nor
in
*NL*
any
place
.
It
is
not
their
names
that
recur
in
the
parish
*NL*
register
.
It
is
not
their
ghosts
that
sigh
among
the
alders
*NL*
at
evening
.
They
have
swept
into
the
valley
and
swept
out
*NL*
of
it
,
leaving
a
little
dust
and
a
little
money
behind
.

*NL*
Chapter
30
*NL*
*NL*
Tibby
was
now
approaching
his
last
year
at
Oxford
.
He
had
*NL*
moved
out
of
college
,
and
was
contemplating
the
Universe
,
or
*NL*
such
portions
of
it
as
concerned
him
,
from
his
comfortable
*NL*
lodgings
in
Long
Wall
.
He
was
not
concerned
with
much
.
*NL*
When
a
young
man
is
untroubled
by
passions
and
sincerely
*NL*
indifferent
to
public
opinion
,
his
outlook
is
necessarily
*NL*
limited
.
Tibby
neither
wished
to
strengthen
the
position
of
*NL*
the
rich
nor
to
improve
that
of
the
poor
,
and
so
was
well
*NL*
content
to
watch
the
elms
nodding
behind
the
mildly
*NL*
embattled
parapets
of
Magdalen
.
There
are
worse
lives
.
*NL*
Though
selfish
,
he
was
never
cruel
;
though
affected
in
*NL*
manner
,
he
never
posed
.
Like
Margaret
,
he
disdained
the
*NL*
heroic
equipment
,
and
it
was
only
after
many
visits
that
men
*NL*
discovered
Schlegel
to
possess
a
character
and
a
brain
.
He
*NL*
had
done
well
in
Mods
,
much
to
the
surprise
of
those
who
*NL*
attended
lectures
and
took
proper
exercise
,
and
was
now
*NL*
glancing
disdainfully
at
Chinese
in
case
he
should
some
day
*NL*
consent
to
qualify
as
a
Student
Interpreter
.
To
him
thus
*NL*
employed
Helen
entered
.
A
telegram
had
preceded
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
noticed
,
in
a
distant
way
,
that
his
sister
had
*NL*
altered
.
As
a
rule
he
found
her
too
pronounced
,
and
had
*NL*
never
come
across
this
look
of
appeal
,
pathetic
yet
*NL*
dignified
--
the
look
of
a
sailor
who
has
lost
everything
at
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
come
from
Oniton
,
''
she
began
.
``
There
has
been
a
*NL*
great
deal
of
trouble
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
for
lunch
?
''
said
Tibby
,
picking
up
the
claret
,
*NL*
which
was
warming
in
the
hearth
.
Helen
sat
down
*NL*
submissively
at
the
table
.
``
Why
such
an
early
start
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sunrise
or
something
--
when
I
could
get
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
surmise
.
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
's
to
be
done
,
Tibby
.
I
am
very
much
*NL*
upset
at
a
piece
of
news
that
concerns
Meg
,
and
do
not
want
*NL*
to
face
her
,
and
I
am
not
going
back
to
Wickham
Place
.
I
*NL*
stopped
here
to
tell
you
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
landlady
came
in
with
the
cutlets
.
Tibby
put
a
*NL*
marker
in
the
leaves
of
his
Chinese
Grammar
and
helped
*NL*
them
.
Oxford
--
the
Oxford
of
the
vacation
--
dreamed
and
*NL*
rustled
outside
,
and
indoors
the
little
fire
was
coated
with
*NL*
grey
where
the
sunshine
touched
it
.
Helen
continued
her
odd
*NL*
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
Meg
my
love
and
say
that
I
want
to
be
alone
.
I
*NL*
mean
to
go
to
Munich
or
else
Bonn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Such
a
message
is
easily
given
,
''
said
her
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
regards
Wickham
Place
and
my
share
of
the
furniture
,
*NL*
you
and
she
are
to
do
exactly
as
you
like
.
My
own
feeling
*NL*
is
that
everything
may
just
as
well
be
sold
.
What
does
one
*NL*
want
with
dusty
economic
,
books
,
which
have
made
the
world
*NL*
no
better
,
or
with
mother
's
hideous
chiffoniers
?
I
have
*NL*
also
another
commission
for
you
.
I
want
you
to
deliver
a
*NL*
letter
.
''
She
got
up
.
``
I
have
n't
written
it
yet
.
Why
*NL*
should
n't
I
post
it
,
though
?
''
She
sat
down
again
.
``
My
head
*NL*
is
rather
wretched
.
I
hope
that
none
of
your
friends
are
*NL*
likely
to
come
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tibby
locked
the
door
.
His
friends
often
found
it
in
*NL*
this
condition
.
Then
he
asked
whether
anything
had
gone
*NL*
wrong
at
Evie
's
wedding
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
there
,
''
said
Helen
,
and
burst
into
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
known
her
hysterical
--
it
was
one
of
her
aspects
*NL*
with
which
he
had
no
concern
--
and
yet
these
tears
touched
*NL*
him
as
something
unusual
.
They
were
nearer
the
things
that
*NL*
did
concern
him
,
such
as
music
.
He
laid
down
his
knife
and
*NL*
looked
at
her
curiously
.
Then
,
as
she
continued
to
sob
,
he
*NL*
went
on
with
his
lunch
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
time
came
for
the
second
course
,
and
she
was
still
*NL*
crying
.
Apple
Charlotte
was
to
follow
,
which
spoils
by
*NL*
waiting
.
``
Do
you
mind
Mrs.
Martlett
coming
in
?
''
he
asked
,
*NL*
``
or
shall
I
take
it
from
her
at
the
door
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Could
I
bathe
my
eyes
,
Tibby
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
her
to
his
bedroom
,
and
introduced
the
pudding
*NL*
in
her
absence
.
Having
helped
himself
,
he
put
it
down
to
*NL*
warm
in
the
hearth
.
His
hand
stretched
towards
the
Grammar
,
*NL*
and
soon
he
was
turning
over
the
pages
,
raising
his
eyebrows
*NL*
scornfully
,
perhaps
at
human
nature
,
perhaps
at
Chinese
.
To
*NL*
him
thus
employed
Helen
returned
.
She
had
pulled
herself
*NL*
together
,
but
the
grave
appeal
had
not
vanished
from
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
for
the
explanation
,
''
she
said
.
``
Why
did
n't
I
*NL*
begin
with
it
?
I
have
found
out
something
about
Mr.
*NL*
Wilcox
.
He
has
behaved
very
wrongly
indeed
,
and
ruined
two
*NL*
people
's
lives
.
It
all
came
on
me
very
suddenly
last
night
;
*NL*
I
am
very
much
upset
,
and
I
do
not
know
what
to
do
.
Mrs.
Bast
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
those
people
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Helen
seemed
silenced
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
lock
the
door
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
thanks
,
Tibbikins
.
You
're
being
very
good
to
me
.
*NL*
I
want
to
tell
you
the
story
before
I
go
abroad
.
You
must
*NL*
do
exactly
what
you
like
--
treat
it
as
part
of
the
*NL*
furniture
.
Meg
can
not
have
heard
it
yet
,
I
think
.
But
I
*NL*
can
not
face
her
and
tell
her
that
the
man
she
is
going
to
*NL*
marry
has
misconducted
himself
.
I
do
n't
even
know
whether
*NL*
she
ought
to
be
told
.
Knowing
as
she
does
that
I
dislike
*NL*
him
,
she
will
suspect
me
,
and
think
that
I
want
to
ruin
her
*NL*
match
.
I
simply
do
n't
know
what
to
make
of
such
a
thing
.
I
*NL*
trust
your
judgment
.
What
would
you
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
gather
he
has
had
a
mistress
,
''
said
Tibby
.
*NL*
*NL*
Helen
flushed
with
shame
and
anger
.
``
And
ruined
two
*NL*
people
's
lives
.
And
goes
about
saying
that
personal
actions
*NL*
count
for
nothing
,
and
there
always
will
be
rich
and
poor
.
*NL*
He
met
her
when
he
was
trying
to
get
rich
out
in
Cyprus
--
I
*NL*
do
n't
wish
to
make
him
worse
than
he
is
,
and
no
doubt
she
*NL*
was
ready
enough
to
meet
him
.
But
there
it
is
.
They
met
.
*NL*
He
goes
his
way
and
she
goes
hers
.
What
do
you
suppose
is
*NL*
the
end
of
such
women
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
conceded
that
it
was
a
bad
business
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
end
in
two
ways
:
Either
they
sink
till
the
lunatic
*NL*
asylums
and
the
workhouses
are
full
of
them
,
and
cause
Mr.
*NL*
Wilcox
to
write
letters
to
the
papers
complaining
of
our
*NL*
national
degeneracy
,
or
else
they
entrap
a
boy
into
marriage
*NL*
before
it
is
too
late
.
She
--
I
ca
n't
blame
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
this
is
n't
all
,
''
she
continued
after
a
long
pause
,
*NL*
during
which
the
landlady
served
them
with
coffee
.
``
I
come
*NL*
now
to
the
business
that
took
us
to
Oniton
.
We
went
all
*NL*
three
.
Acting
on
Mr.
Wilcox
's
advice
,
the
man
throws
up
a
*NL*
secure
situation
and
takes
an
insecure
one
,
from
which
he
is
*NL*
dismissed
.
There
are
certain
excuses
,
but
in
the
main
Mr.
*NL*
Wilcox
is
to
blame
,
as
Meg
herself
admitted
.
It
is
only
*NL*
common
justice
that
he
should
employ
the
man
himself
.
But
*NL*
he
meets
the
woman
,
and
,
like
the
cur
that
he
is
,
he
*NL*
refuses
,
and
tries
to
get
rid
of
them
.
He
makes
Meg
write
.
*NL*
Two
notes
came
from
her
late
that
evening
--
one
for
me
,
one
*NL*
for
Leonard
,
dismissing
him
with
barely
a
reason
.
I
*NL*
could
n't
understand
.
Then
it
comes
out
that
Mrs.
Bast
had
*NL*
spoken
to
Mr.
Wilcox
on
the
lawn
while
we
left
her
to
get
*NL*
rooms
,
and
was
still
speaking
about
him
when
Leonard
came
*NL*
back
to
her
.
This
Leonard
knew
all
along
.
He
thought
it
*NL*
natural
he
should
be
ruined
twice
.
Natural
!
Could
you
have
*NL*
contained
yourself
?
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
certainly
a
very
bad
business
,
''
said
Tibby
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
reply
seemed
to
calm
his
sister
.
``
I
was
afraid
that
*NL*
I
saw
it
out
of
proportion
.
But
you
are
right
outside
it
,
*NL*
and
you
must
know
.
In
a
day
or
two
--
or
perhaps
a
week
--
take
*NL*
whatever
steps
you
think
fit
.
I
leave
it
in
your
hands
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
concluded
her
charge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
facts
as
they
touch
Meg
are
all
before
you
,
''
she
*NL*
added
;
and
Tibby
sighed
and
felt
it
rather
hard
that
,
*NL*
because
of
his
open
mind
,
he
should
be
empanelled
to
serve
*NL*
as
a
juror
.
He
had
never
been
interested
in
human
beings
,
*NL*
for
which
one
must
blame
him
,
but
he
had
had
rather
too
much
*NL*
of
them
at
Wickham
Place
.
Just
as
some
people
cease
to
*NL*
attend
when
books
are
mentioned
,
so
Tibby
's
attention
*NL*
wandered
when
``
personal
relations
''
came
under
discussion
.
*NL*
Ought
Margaret
to
know
what
Helen
knew
the
Basts
to
know
?
*NL*
Similar
questions
had
vexed
him
from
infancy
,
and
at
Oxford
*NL*
he
had
learned
to
say
that
the
importance
of
human
beings
*NL*
has
been
vastly
overrated
by
specialists
.
The
epigram
,
with
*NL*
its
faint
whiff
of
the
eighties
,
meant
nothing
.
But
he
*NL*
might
have
let
it
off
now
if
his
sister
had
not
been
*NL*
ceaselessly
beautiful
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
Helen
--
have
a
cigarette
--
I
do
n't
see
what
I
'm
*NL*
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
there
's
nothing
to
be
done
.
I
dare
say
you
are
*NL*
right
.
Let
them
marry
.
There
remains
the
question
of
*NL*
compensation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
want
me
to
adjudicate
that
too
?
Had
you
not
*NL*
better
consult
an
expert
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
part
is
in
confidence
,
''
said
Helen
.
``
It
has
*NL*
nothing
to
do
with
Meg
,
and
do
not
mention
it
to
her
.
The
*NL*
compensation
--
I
do
not
see
who
is
to
pay
it
if
I
do
n't
,
and
*NL*
I
have
already
decided
on
the
minimum
sum
.
As
soon
as
*NL*
possible
I
am
placing
it
to
your
account
,
and
when
I
am
in
*NL*
Germany
you
will
pay
it
over
for
me
.
I
shall
never
forget
*NL*
your
kindness
,
Tibbikins
,
if
you
do
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
sum
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Five
thousand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
God
alive
!
''
said
Tibby
,
and
went
crimson
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
what
is
the
good
of
driblets
?
To
go
through
life
*NL*
having
done
one
thing
--
to
have
raised
one
person
from
the
*NL*
abyss
:
not
these
puny
gifts
of
shillings
and
*NL*
blankets
--
making
the
grey
more
grey
.
No
doubt
people
will
*NL*
think
me
extraordinary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
care
a
damn
what
people
think
!
''
cried
he
,
*NL*
heated
to
unusual
manliness
of
diction
.
``
But
it
's
half
what
*NL*
you
have
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
nearly
half
.
''
She
spread
out
her
hands
over
her
*NL*
soiled
skirt
.
``
I
have
far
too
much
,
and
we
settled
at
*NL*
Chelsea
last
spring
that
three
hundred
a
year
is
necessary
*NL*
to
set
a
man
on
his
feet
.
What
I
give
will
bring
in
a
*NL*
hundred
and
fifty
between
two

It
is
n't
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
recover
.
He
was
not
angry
or
even
shocked
,
*NL*
and
he
saw
that
Helen
would
still
have
plenty
to
live
on
.
*NL*
But
it
amazed
him
to
think
what
haycocks
people
can
make
of
*NL*
their
lives
.
His
delicate
intonations
would
not
work
,
and
*NL*
he
could
only
blurt
out
that
the
five
thousand
pounds
would
*NL*
mean
a
great
deal
of
bother
for
him
personally
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
expect
you

understand
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
?
I
understand
nobody

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
'll
do
it
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Apparently
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
leave
you
two
commissions
,
then
.
The
first
concerns
*NL*
Mr.
Wilcox
,
and
you
are
to
use
your
discretion
.
The
second
*NL*
concerns
the
money
,
and
is
to
be
mentioned
to
no
one
,
and
*NL*
carried
out
literally
.
You
will
send
a
hundred
pounds
on
*NL*
account
tomorrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
with
her
to
the
station
,
passing
through
those
*NL*
streets
whose
serried
beauty
never
bewildered
him
and
never
*NL*
fatigued
.
The
lovely
creature
raised
domes
and
spires
into
*NL*
the
cloudless
blue
,
and
only
the
ganglion
of
vulgarity
round
*NL*
Carfax
showed
how
evanescent
was
the
phantom
,
how
faint
its
*NL*
claim
to
represent
England
.
Helen
,
rehearsing
her
*NL*
commission
,
noticed
nothing
:
the
Basts
were
in
her
brain
,
*NL*
and
she
retold
the
crisis
in
a
meditative
way
,
which
might
*NL*
have
made
other
men
curious
.
She
was
seeing
whether
it
*NL*
would
hold
.
He
asked
her
once
why
she
had
taken
the
Basts
*NL*
right
into
the
heart
of
Evie
's
wedding
.
She
stopped
like
a
*NL*
frightened
animal
and
said
,
``
Does
that
seem
to
you
so
odd
?
''
*NL*
Her
eyes
,
the
hand
laid
on
the
mouth
,
quite
haunted
him
,
*NL*
until
they
were
absorbed
into
the
figure
of
St.
Mary
the
*NL*
Virgin
,
before
whom
he
paused
for
a
moment
on
the
walk
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
convenient
to
follow
him
in
the
discharge
of
his
*NL*
duties
.
Margaret
summoned
him
the
next
day
.
She
was
*NL*
terrified
at
Helen
's
flight
,
and
he
had
to
say
that
she
had
*NL*
called
in
at
Oxford
.
Then
she
said
:
``
Did
she
seem
worried
*NL*
at
any
rumour
about
Henry
?
''
He
answered
,
``
Yes
.
''
``
I
knew
it
*NL*
was
that
!
''
she
exclaimed
.
``
I
'll
write
to
her
.
''
Tibby
was
relieved
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
then
sent
the
cheque
to
the
address
that
Helen
gave
*NL*
him
,
and
stated
that
later
on
he
was
instructed
to
forward
*NL*
five
thousand
pounds
.
An
answer
came
back
,
very
civil
and
*NL*
quiet
in
tone
--
such
an
answer
as
Tibby
himself
would
have
*NL*
given
.
The
cheque
was
returned
,
the
legacy
refused
,
the
*NL*
writer
being
in
no
need
of
money
.
Tibby
forwarded
this
to
*NL*
Helen
,
adding
in
the
fulness
of
his
heart
that
Leonard
Bast
*NL*
seemed
somewhat
a
monumental
person
after
all
.
Helen
's
*NL*
reply
was
frantic
.
He
was
to
take
no
notice
.
He
was
to
go
*NL*
down
at
once
and
say
that
she
commanded
acceptance
.
He
*NL*
went
.
A
scurf
of
books
and
china
ornaments
awaited
them
.
*NL*
The
Basts
had
just
been
evicted
for
not
paying
their
rent
,
*NL*
and
had
wandered
no
one
knew
whither
.
Helen
had
begun
*NL*
bungling
with
her
money
by
this
time
,
and
had
even
sold
out
*NL*
her
shares
in
the
Nottingham
and
Derby
Railway
.
For
some
*NL*
weeks
she
did
nothing
.
Then
she
reinvested
,
and
,
owing
to
*NL*
the
good
advice
of
her
stockbrokers
,
became
rather
richer
*NL*
than
she
had
been
before
.

Chapter
31
*NL*
*NL*
Houses
have
their
own
ways
of
dying
,
falling
as
variously
as
*NL*
the
generations
of
men
,
some
with
a
tragic
roar
,
some
*NL*
quietly
,
but
to
an
after-life
in
the
city
of
ghosts
,
while
*NL*
from
others
--
and
thus
was
the
death
of
Wickham
Place
--
the
*NL*
spirit
slips
before
the
body
perishes
.
It
had
decayed
in
*NL*
the
spring
,
disintegrating
the
girls
more
than
they
knew
,
*NL*
and
causing
either
to
accost
unfamiliar
regions
.
By
*NL*
September
it
was
a
corpse
,
void
of
emotion
,
and
scarcely
*NL*
hallowed
by
the
memories
of
thirty
years
of
happiness
.
*NL*
Through
its
round-topped
doorway
passed
furniture
,
and
*NL*
pictures
,
and
books
,
until
the
last
room
was
gutted
and
the
*NL*
last
van
had
rumbled
away
.
It
stood
for
a
week
or
two
*NL*
longer
,
open-eyed
,
as
if
astonished
at
its
own
emptiness
.
*NL*
Then
it
fell
.
Navvies
came
,
and
spilt
it
back
into
the
*NL*
grey
.
With
their
muscles
and
their
beery
good
temper
,
they
*NL*
were
not
the
worst
of
undertakers
for
a
house
which
had
*NL*
always
been
human
,
and
had
not
mistaken
culture
for
an
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
furniture
,
with
a
few
exceptions
,
went
down
into
*NL*
Hertfordshire
,
Mr.
Wilcox
having
most
kindly
offered
Howards
*NL*
End
as
a
warehouse
.
Mr.
Bryce
had
died
abroad
--
an
*NL*
unsatisfactory
affair
--
and
as
there
seemed
little
guarantee
*NL*
that
the
rent
would
be
paid
regularly
,
he
cancelled
the
*NL*
agreement
,
and
resumed
possession
himself
.
Until
he
relet
*NL*
the
house
,
the
Schlegels
were
welcome
to
stack
their
*NL*
furniture
in
the
garage
and
lower
rooms
.
Margaret
demurred
,
*NL*
but
Tibby
accepted
the
offer
gladly
;
it
saved
him
from
*NL*
coming
to
any
decision
about
the
future
.
The
plate
and
the
*NL*
more
valuable
pictures
found
a
safer
home
in
London
,
but
the
*NL*
bulk
of
the
things
went
country-ways
,
and
were
entrusted
to
*NL*
the
guardianship
of
Miss
Avery
.
*NL*
*NL*
Shortly
before
the
move
,
our
hero
and
heroine
were
*NL*
married
.
They
have
weathered
the
storm
,
and
may
reasonably
*NL*
expect
peace
.
To
have
no
illusions
and
yet
to
love
--
what
*NL*
stronger
surety
can
a
woman
find
?
She
had
seen
her
*NL*
husband
's
past
as
well
as
his
heart
.
She
knew
her
own
heart
*NL*
with
a
thoroughness
that
commonplace
people
believe
*NL*
impossible
.
The
heart
of
Mrs.
Wilcox
was
alone
hidden
,
and
*NL*
perhaps
it
is
superstitious
to
speculate
on
the
feelings
of
*NL*
the
dead
.
They
were
married
quietly
--
really
quietly
,
for
as
*NL*
the
day
approached
she
refused
to
go
through
another
*NL*
Oniton
.
Her
brother
gave
her
away
,
her
aunt
,
who
was
out
of
*NL*
health
,
presided
over
a
few
colourless
refreshments
.
The
*NL*
Wilcoxes
were
represented
by
Charles
,
who
witnessed
the
*NL*
marriage
settlement
,
and
by
Mr.
Cahill
.
Paul
did
send
a
*NL*
cablegram
.
In
a
few
minutes
,
and
without
the
aid
of
music
,
*NL*
the
clergyman
made
them
man
and
wife
,
and
soon
the
glass
*NL*
shade
had
fallen
that
cuts
off
married
couples
from
the
*NL*
world
.
She
,
a
monogamist
,
regretted
the
cessation
of
some
*NL*
of
life
's
innocent
odours
;
he
,
whose
instincts
were
*NL*
polygamous
,
felt
morally
braced
by
the
change
,
and
less
*NL*
liable
to
the
temptations
that
had
assailed
him
in
the
past
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
spent
their
honeymoon
near
Innsbruck
.
Henry
knew
*NL*
of
a
reliable
hotel
there
,
and
Margaret
hoped
for
a
meeting
*NL*
with
her
sister
.
In
this
she
was
disappointed
.
As
they
*NL*
came
south
,
Helen
retreated
over
the
Brenner
,
and
wrote
an
*NL*
unsatisfactory
postcard
from
the
shores
of
the
Lake
of
*NL*
Garda
,
saying
that
her
plans
were
uncertain
and
had
better
*NL*
be
ignored
.
Evidently
she
disliked
meeting
Henry
.
Two
*NL*
months
are
surely
enough
to
accustom
an
outsider
to
a
*NL*
situation
which
a
wife
has
accepted
in
two
days
,
and
*NL*
Margaret
had
again
to
regret
her
sister
's
lack
of
*NL*
self-control
.
In
a
long
letter
she
pointed
out
the
need
of
*NL*
charity
in
sexual
matters
:
so
little
is
known
about
them
;
it
*NL*
is
hard
enough
for
those
who
are
personally
touched
to
*NL*
judge
;
then
how
futile
must
be
the
verdict
of
Society
.
``
I
*NL*
do
n't
say
there
is
no
standard
,
for
that
would
destroy
*NL*
morality
;
only
that
there
can
be
no
standard
until
our
*NL*
impulses
are
classified
and
better
understood
.
''
Helen
*NL*
thanked
her
for
her
kind
letter
--
rather
a
curious
reply
.
*NL*
She
moved
south
again
,
and
spoke
of
wintering
in
Naples
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Wilcox
was
not
sorry
that
the
meeting
failed
.
Helen
*NL*
left
him
time
to
grow
skin
over
his
wound
.
There
were
still
*NL*
moments
when
it
pained
him
.
Had
he
only
known
that
Margaret
*NL*
was
awaiting
him
--
Margaret
,
so
lively
and
intelligent
,
and
*NL*
yet
so
submissive
--
he
would
have
kept
himself
worthier
of
*NL*
her
.
Incapable
of
grouping
the
past
,
he
confused
the
*NL*
episode
of
Jacky
with
another
episode
that
had
taken
place
*NL*
in
the
days
of
his
bachelorhood
.
The
two
made
one
crop
of
*NL*
wild
oats
,
for
which
he
was
heartily
sorry
,
and
he
could
not
*NL*
see
that
those
oats
are
of
a
darker
stock
which
are
rooted
*NL*
in
another
's
dishonour
.
Unchastity
and
infidelity
were
as
*NL*
confused
to
him
as
to
the
Middle
Ages
,
his
only
moral
*NL*
teacher
.
Ruth
-LRB-
poor
old
Ruth
!
-RRB-
did
not
enter
into
his
*NL*
calculations
at
all
,
for
poor
old
Ruth
had
never
found
him
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
affection
for
his
present
wife
grew
steadily
.
Her
*NL*
cleverness
gave
him
no
trouble
,
and
,
indeed
,
he
liked
to
see
*NL*
her
reading
poetry
or
something
about
social
questions
;
it
*NL*
distinguished
her
from
the
wives
of
other
men
.
He
had
only
*NL*
to
call
,
and
she
clapped
the
book
up
and
was
ready
to
do
*NL*
what
he
wished
.
Then
they
would
argue
so
jollily
,
and
once
*NL*
or
twice
she
had
him
in
quite
a
tight
corner
,
but
as
soon
as
*NL*
he
grew
really
serious
,
she
gave
in
.
Man
is
for
war
,
woman
*NL*
for
the
recreation
of
the
warrior
,
but
he
does
not
dislike
*NL*
it
if
she
makes
a
show
of
fight
.
She
can
not
win
in
a
real
*NL*
battle
,
having
no
muscles
,
only
nerves
.
Nerves
make
her
*NL*
jump
out
of
a
moving
motor-car
,
or
refuse
to
be
married
*NL*
fashionably
.
The
warrior
may
well
allow
her
to
triumph
on
*NL*
such
occasions
;
they
move
not
the
imperishable
plinth
of
*NL*
things
that
touch
his
peace
.
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
had
a
bad
attack
of
these
nerves
during
the
*NL*
honeymoon
.
He
told
her
--
casually
,
as
was
his
habit
--
that
*NL*
Oniton
Grange
was
let
.
She
showed
her
annoyance
,
and
asked
*NL*
rather
crossly
why
she
had
not
been
consulted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
want
to
bother
you
,
''
he
replied
.
``
Besides
,
I
*NL*
have
only
heard
for
certain
this
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
we
to
live
?
''
said
Margaret
,
trying
to
laugh
.
*NL*
``
I
loved
the
place
extraordinarily
.
Do
n't
you
believe
in
*NL*
having
a
permanent
home
,
Henry
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
assured
her
that
she
misunderstood
him
.
It
is
home
*NL*
life
that
distinguishes
us
from
the
foreigner
.
But
he
did
*NL*
not
believe
in
a
damp
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
news
.
I
never
heard
till
this
minute
that
*NL*
Oniton
was
damp
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
girl
!
''
--
he
flung
out
his
hand
--
``
have
you
eyes
?
*NL*
have
you
a
skin
?
How
could
it
be
anything
but
damp
in
such
*NL*
a
situation
?
In
the
first
place
,
the
Grange
is
on
clay
,
and
*NL*
built
where
the
castle
moat
must
have
been
;
then
there
's
*NL*
that
destestable
little
river
,
steaming
all
night
like
a
*NL*
kettle
.
Feel
the
cellar
walls
;
look
up
under
the
eaves
.
*NL*
Ask
Sir
James
or
anyone
.
Those
Shropshire
valleys
are
*NL*
notorious
.
The
only
possible
place
for
a
house
in
*NL*
Shropshire
is
on
a
hill
;
but
,
for
my
part
,
I
think
the
*NL*
country
is
too
far
from
London
,
and
the
scenery
nothing
*NL*
special
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
could
not
resist
saying
,
``
Why
did
you
go
there
,
*NL*
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
--
because
--
''
He
drew
his
head
back
and
grew
rather
*NL*
angry
.
``
Why
have
we
come
to
the
Tyrol
,
if
it
comes
to
*NL*
that
?
One
might
go
on
asking
such
questions
indefinitely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
might
;
but
he
was
only
gaining
time
for
a
plausible
*NL*
answer
.
Out
it
came
,
and
he
believed
it
as
soon
as
it
was
spoken
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
truth
is
,
I
took
Oniton
on
account
of
Evie
.
Do
n't
*NL*
let
this
go
any
further
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
n't
like
her
to
know
that
she
nearly
let
me
in
*NL*
for
a
very
bad
bargain
.
No
sooner
did
I
sign
the
agreement
*NL*
than
she
got
engaged
.
Poor
little
girl
!
She
was
so
keen
on
*NL*
it
all
,
and
would
n't
even
wait
to
make
proper
inquiries
*NL*
about
the
shooting
.
Afraid
it
would
get
snapped
up
--
just
*NL*
like
all
of
your
sex
.
Well
,
no
harm
's
done
.
She
has
had
*NL*
her
country
wedding
,
and
I
've
got
rid
of
my
house
to
some
*NL*
fellows
who
are
starting
a
preparatory
school
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
shall
we
live
,
then
,
Henry
?
I
should
enjoy
*NL*
living
somewhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
yet
decided
.
What
about
Norfolk
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
was
silent
.
Marriage
had
not
saved
her
from
*NL*
the
sense
of
flux
.
London
was
but
a
foretaste
of
this
*NL*
nomadic
civilization
which
is
altering
human
nature
so
*NL*
profoundly
,
and
throws
upon
personal
relations
a
stress
*NL*
greater
than
they
have
ever
borne
before
.
Under
*NL*
cosmopolitanism
,
if
it
comes
,
we
shall
receive
no
help
from
*NL*
the
earth
.
Trees
and
meadows
and
mountains
will
only
be
a
*NL*
spectacle
,
and
the
binding
force
that
they
once
exercised
on
*NL*
character
must
be
entrusted
to
Love
alone
.
May
Love
be
*NL*
equal
to
the
task
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
now
what
?
''
continued
Henry
.
``
Nearly
October
.
*NL*
Let
us
camp
for
the
winter
at
Ducie
Street
,
and
look
out
for
*NL*
something
in
the
spring
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
possible
,
something
permanent
.
I
ca
n't
be
as
young
*NL*
as
I
was
,
for
these
alterations
do
n't
suit
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
my
dear
,
which
would
you
rather
have
--
alterations
*NL*
or
rheumatism
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
your
point
,
''
said
Margaret
,
getting
up
.
``
If
*NL*
Oniton
is
really
damp
,
it
is
impossible
,
and
must
be
*NL*
inhabited
by
little
boys
.
Only
,
in
the
spring
,
let
us
look
*NL*
before
we
leap
.
I
will
take
warning
by
Evie
,
and
not
hurry
*NL*
you
.
Remember
that
you
have
a
free
hand
this
time
.
These
*NL*
endless
moves
must
be
bad
for
the
furniture
,
and
are
*NL*
certainly
expensive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
practical
little
woman
it
is
!
What
's
it
been
*NL*
reading
?
Theo
--
theo
--
how
much
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Theosophy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
Ducie
Street
was
her
first
fate
--
a
pleasant
enough
*NL*
fate
.
The
house
,
being
only
a
little
larger
than
Wickham
*NL*
Place
,
trained
her
for
the
immense
establishment
that
was
*NL*
promised
in
the
spring
.
They
were
frequently
away
,
but
at
*NL*
home
life
ran
fairly
regularly
.
In
the
morning
Henry
went
*NL*
to
the
business
,
and
his
sandwich
--
a
relic
this
of
some
*NL*
prehistoric
craving
--
was
always
cut
by
her
own
hand
.
He
did
*NL*
not
rely
upon
the
sandwich
for
lunch
,
but
liked
to
have
it
*NL*
by
him
in
case
he
grew
hungry
at
eleven
.
When
he
had
gone
,
*NL*
there
was
the
house
to
look
after
,
and
the
servants
to
*NL*
humanize
,
and
several
kettles
of
Helen
's
to
keep
on
the
*NL*
boil
.
Her
conscience
pricked
her
a
little
about
the
Basts
;
*NL*
she
was
not
sorry
to
have
lost
sight
of
them
.
No
doubt
*NL*
Leonard
was
worth
helping
,
but
being
Henry
's
wife
,
she
*NL*
preferred
to
help
someone
else
.
As
for
theatres
and
*NL*
discussion
societies
,
they
attracted
her
less
and
less
.
She
*NL*
began
to
``
miss
''
new
movements
,
and
to
spend
her
spare
time
*NL*
re-reading
or
thinking
,
rather
to
the
concern
of
her
Chelsea
*NL*
friends
.
They
attributed
the
change
to
her
marriage
,
and
*NL*
perhaps
some
deep
instinct
did
warn
her
not
to
travel
*NL*
further
from
her
husband
than
was
inevitable
.
Yet
the
main
*NL*
cause
lay
deeper
still
;
she
had
outgrown
stimulants
,
and
was
*NL*
passing
from
words
to
things
.
It
was
doubtless
a
pity
not
*NL*
to
keep
up
with
Wedekind
or
John
,
but
some
closing
of
the
*NL*
gates
is
inevitable
after
thirty
,
if
the
mind
itself
is
to
*NL*
become
a
creative
power
.

*NL*
She
was
looking
at
plans
one
day
in
the
following
*NL*
spring
--
they
had
finally
decided
to
go
down
into
Sussex
and
*NL*
build
--
when
Mrs.
Charles
Wilcox
was
announced
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
heard
the
news
?
''
Dolly
cried
,
as
soon
as
she
*NL*
entered
the
room
.
``
Charles
is
so
ang
--
I
mean
he
is
sure
you
*NL*
know
about
it
,
or
rather
,
that
you
do
n't
know

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Dolly
!
''
said
Margaret
,
placidly
kissing
her
.
*NL*
``
Here
's
a
surprise
!
How
are
the
boys
and
the
baby
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Boys
and
the
baby
were
well
,
and
in
describing
a
great
*NL*
row
that
there
had
been
at
Hilton
Tennis
Club
,
Dolly
forgot
*NL*
her
news
.
The
wrong
people
had
tried
to
get
in
.
The
*NL*
rector
,
as
representing
the
older
inhabitants
,
had
*NL*
said
--
Charles
had
said
--
the
tax-collector
had
said
--
Charles
*NL*
had
regretted
not
saying
--
and
she
closed
the
description
*NL*
with
,
``
But
lucky
you
,
with
four
courts
of
your
own
at
Midhurst
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
be
very
jolly
,
''
replied
Margaret
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
those
the
plans
?
Does
it
matter
me
seeing
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Charles
has
never
seen
the
plans
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
have
only
just
arrived
.
Here
is
the
ground
*NL*
floor

no

that
's
rather
difficult

Try
the
elevation

We
*NL*
are
to
have
a
good
many
gables
and
a
picturesque
sky-line
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
makes
it
smell
so
funny
?
''
said
Dolly
,
after
a
*NL*
moment
's
inspection
.
She
was
incapable
of
understanding
*NL*
plans
or
maps
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
the
paper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
WHICH
way
up
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
the
ordinary
way
up

's
the
sky-line

part
that

strongest

sky

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

another

to

Helen

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
well

*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
she
never

*NL*
*NL*
``
So
it
is
,
''
said
Margaret
,
trying
to
conceal
her
*NL*
vexation
.
She
was
getting
rather
sore
on
this
point
.
*NL*
``

odd

away

*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly

She
left
just
after
Evie

wedding

It
would
*NL*
be
eight
months

*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
when
baby
was
born

then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
so

*NL*
*NL*
Dolly
sighed
,
and
stared
enviously
round
the
*NL*
drawing-room
.
She
was
beginning
to
lose
her
brightness
and
*NL*
good
looks
.
The
Charles
'
were
not
well
off
,
for
Mr.
Wilcox
,
*NL*
having
brought
up
his
children
with
expensive
tastes
,
*NL*
believed
in
letting
them
shift
for
themselves
.
After
all
,
*NL*
he
had
not
treated
them
generously
.
Yet
another
baby
was
*NL*
expected
,
she
told
Margaret
,
and
they
would
have
to
give
up
*NL*
the
motor
.
Margaret
sympathized
,
but
in
a
formal
fashion
,
*NL*
and
Dolly
little
imagined
that
the
step-mother
was
urging
*NL*
Mr.
Wilcox
to
make
them
a
more
liberal
allowance
.
She
*NL*
sighed
again
,
and
at
last
the
particular
grievance
was
*NL*
remembered
.
``
Oh
yes
,
''
she
cried
,
``
that
is
it
:
Miss
Avery
*NL*
has
been
unpacking
your
packing-cases

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
has
she
done
that

How
unnecessary

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ask
another

suppose
you
ordered
her
to

*NL*
``
I
gave
no
such

Perhaps
she
was
airing
the

undertake

light

fire

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
far
more
than
an
air

said
Dolly
solemnly
.
*NL*
``
The
floor
sounds
covered

I

dotty

She
was
the

never

you
know

Oh
,
I
say
,
perhaps
she
thinks
your

Old

I

A
visit
from

Dolly
had
its
compensations

*NL*
*NL*
``
Did

you

she
gave
Evie

then
--
oh

You
never

read

Miss

wrote

*NL*
*NL*

But
it
was
wrong

heartless
thing

*NL*
*NL*

the

``
Still

over
five
pounds

I
did
n't
see
it

it
was
a
lovely
enamel
pendant
from
a
Bond

shop

*NL*
You

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
accepted

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
mine
was
old
earthenware
stuff

not
worth
a
*NL*
halfpenny
.
Evie

was
quite
different
.
You
'd
have
to
ask
*NL*
anyone
to
the
wedding
who
gave
you
a
pendant

that

*NL*
Uncle
Percy
and
Albert

all
said
it
*NL*
was
quite
impossible
,
and
when
four
men
agree
,
what
is
a
*NL*
girl
to
do
?
Evie
did
n't
want
to
upset
the
old
thing
,
so
*NL*
thought
a
sort
of
joking
letter
best
,
and
returned
the
*NL*
pendant
straight
to
the
shop
to
save
Miss
Avery
trouble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
Miss
Avery
said
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dolly
's
eyes
grew
round
.
``
It
was
a
perfectly
awful
*NL*
letter

Charles
said
it
was
the
letter
of
a
madman
.
In
the
*NL*
end
she
had
the
pendant
back
again
from
the
shop
and
threw
*NL*
it
into
the
duckpond
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
she
give
any
reasons
?

*NL*
*NL*

climb

*NL*
*NL*
``
She

rather
old

said
Margaret
pensively

*NL*
``
May
not
she
have
given
the
present
to
Evie

*NL*
``
That

a
notion

every

I
suppose
I
ought
to
be
toddling

Come
along
,
Mr.
Muff
--
you
*NL*
want
a
new
coat

but
I
do
n't
know
who
'll
give
it
you
,
I
'm
*NL*
sure
;
''
and
addressing
her
apparel
with
mournful
humour
,
*NL*
Dolly
moved
from
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
followed
her
to
ask
whether
Henry
knew
about
*NL*
Miss
Avery
's
rudeness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
,
then
,
why
he
let
me
ask
her
to
look
after
the
*NL*
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
she
's
only
a
farm
woman
,
''
said
Dolly
,
and
her
*NL*
explanation
proved
correct
.
Henry
only
censured
the
lower
*NL*
classes
when
it
suited
him
.
He
bore
with
Miss
Avery
as
with
*NL*
Crane
--
because
he
could
get
good
value
out
of
them
.
``
I
have
*NL*
patience
with
a
man
who
knows
his
job
,
''
he
would
say
,
really
*NL*
having
patience
with
the
job
,
and
not
the
man
.
Paradoxical
*NL*
as
it
may
sound
,
he
had
something
of
the
artist
about
him
;
*NL*
he
would
pass
over
an
insult
to
his
daughter
sooner
than
*NL*
lose
a
good
charwoman
for
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
judged
it
better
to
settle
the
little
trouble
*NL*
herself
.
Parties
were
evidently
ruffled
.
With
Henry
's
*NL*
permission
,
she
wrote
a
pleasant
note
to
Miss
Avery
,
asking
*NL*
her
to
leave
the
cases
untouched
.
Then
,
at
the
first
*NL*
convenient
opportunity
,
she
went
down
herself
,
intending
to
*NL*
repack
her
belongings
and
store
them
properly
in
the
local
*NL*
warehouse
:
the
plan
had
been
amateurish
and
a
failure
.
*NL*
Tibby
promised
to
accompany
her
,
but
at
the
last
moment
*NL*
begged
to
be
excused
.
So
,
for
the
second
time
in
her
life
,
*NL*
she
entered
the
house
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
33
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
of
her
visit
was
exquisite
,
and
the
last
of
*NL*
unclouded
happiness
that
she
was
to
have
for
many
months
.
*NL*
Her
anxiety
about
Helen
's
extraordinary
absence
was
still
*NL*
dormant
,
and
as
for
a
possible
brush
with
Miss
Avery
--
that
*NL*
only
gave
zest
to
the
expedition
.
She
had
also
eluded
*NL*
Dolly
's
invitation
to
luncheon
.
Walking
straight
up
from
*NL*
the
station
,
she
crossed
the
village
green
and
entered
the
*NL*
long
chestnut
avenue
that
connects
it
with
the
church
.
The
*NL*
church
itself
stood
in
the
village
once
.
But
it
there
*NL*
attracted
so
many
worshippers
that
the
devil
,
in
a
pet
,
*NL*
snatched
it
from
its
foundations
,
and
poised
it
on
an
*NL*
inconvenient
knoll
,
three-quarters
of
a
mile
away
.
If
this
*NL*
story
is
true
,
the
chestnut
avenue
must
have
been
planted
by
*NL*
the
angels
.
No
more
tempting
approach
could
be
imagined
for
*NL*
the
luke-warm
Christian
,
and
if
he
still
finds
the
walk
too
*NL*
long
,
the
devil
is
defeated
all
the
same
,
Science
having
*NL*
built
Holy
Trinity
,
a
Chapel
of
Ease
,
near
the
Charles
'
,
and
*NL*
roofed
it
with
tin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Up
the
avenue
Margaret
strolled
slowly
,
stopping
to
*NL*
watch
the
sky
that
gleamed
through
the
upper
branches
of
the
*NL*
chestnuts
,
or
to
finger
the
little
horseshoes
on
the
lower
*NL*
branches
.
Why
has
not
England
a
great
mythology
?
Our
*NL*
folklore
has
never
advanced
beyond
daintiness
,
and
the
*NL*
greater
melodies
about
our
country-side
have
all
issued
*NL*
through
the
pipes
of
Greece
.
Deep
and
true
as
the
native
*NL*
imagination
can
be
,
it
seems
to
have
failed
here
.
It
has
*NL*
stopped
with
the
witches
and
the
fairies
.
It
can
not
vivify
*NL*
one
fraction
of
a
summer
field
,
or
give
names
to
half
a
*NL*
dozen
stars
.
England
still
waits
for
the
supreme
moment
of
*NL*
her
literature
--
for
the
great
poet
who
shall
voice
her
,
or
,
*NL*
better
still
,
for
the
thousand
little
poets
whose
voices
*NL*
shall
pass
into
our
common
talk
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
church
the
scenery
changed
.
The
chestnut
avenue
*NL*
opened
into
a
road
,
smooth
but
narrow
,
which
led
into
the
*NL*
untouched
country
.
She
followed
it
for
over
a
mile
.
Its
*NL*
little
hesitations
pleased
her
.
Having
no
urgent
destiny
,
*NL*
it
strolled
downhill
or
up
as
it
wished
,
taking
no
trouble
*NL*
about
the
gradients
,
nor
about
the
view
,
which
nevertheless
*NL*
expanded
.
The
great
estates
that
throttle
the
south
of
*NL*
Hertfordshire
were
less
obtrusive
here
,
and
the
appearance
*NL*
of
the
land
was
neither
aristocratic
nor
suburban
.
To
*NL*
define
it
was
difficult
,
but
Margaret
knew
what
it
was
not
:
*NL*
it
was
not
snobbish
.
Though
its
contours
were
slight
,
there
*NL*
was
a
touch
of
freedom
in
their
sweep
to
which
Surrey
will
*NL*
never
attain
,
and
the
distant
brow
of
the
Chilterns
towered
*NL*
like
a
mountain
.
``
Left
to
itself
,
''
was
Margaret
's
opinion
,
*NL*
``
this
county
would
vote
Liberal
.
''
The
comradeship
,
not
*NL*
passionate
,
that
is
our
highest
gift
as
a
nation
,
was
*NL*
promised
by
it
,
as
by
the
low
brick
farm
where
she
called
*NL*
for
the
key
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
inside
of
the
farm
was
disappointing
.
A
most
*NL*
finished
young
person
received
her
.
``
Yes
,
Mrs.
Wilcox
;
no
,
*NL*
Mrs.
Wilcox
;
oh
yes
,
Mrs.
Wilcox
,
auntie
received
your
*NL*
letter
quite
duly
.
Auntie
has
gone
up
to
your
little
place
*NL*
at
the
present
moment
.
Shall
I
send
the
servant
to
direct
*NL*
you
?
''
Followed
by
:
``
Of
course
,
auntie
does
not
generally
*NL*
look
after
your
place
;
she
only
does
it
to
oblige
a
*NL*
neighbour
as
something
exceptional
.
It
gives
her
something
*NL*
to
do
.
She
spends
quite
a
lot
of
her
time
there
.
My
*NL*
husband
says
to
me
sometimes
,
`
Where
's
auntie
?
'
I
say
,
`
Need
*NL*
you
ask
?
She
's
at
Howards
End
.
'
Yes
,
Mrs.
Wilcox
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Wilcox
,
could
I
prevail
upon
you
to
accept
a
piece
of
cake
?
*NL*
Not
if
I
cut
it
for
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
refused
the
cake
,
but
unfortunately
this
*NL*
acquired
her
gentility
in
the
eyes
of
Miss
Avery
's
niece
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
let
you
go
on
alone
.
Now
do
n't
.
You
really
*NL*
must
n't
.
I
will
direct
you
myself
if
it
comes
to
that
.
I
*NL*
must
get
my
hat
.
Now
''
--
roguishly
--
``
Mrs.
Wilcox
,
do
n't
you
*NL*
move
while
I
'm
gone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Stunned
,
Margaret
did
not
move
from
the
best
parlour
,
*NL*
over
which
the
touch
of
art
nouveau
had
fallen
.
But
the
*NL*
other
rooms
looked
in
keeping
,
though
they
conveyed
the
*NL*
peculiar
sadness
of
a
rural
interior
.
Here
had
lived
an
*NL*
elder
race
,
to
which
we
look
back
with
disquietude
.
The
*NL*
country
which
we
visit
at
week-ends
was
really
a
home
to
it
,
*NL*
and
the
graver
sides
of
life
,
the
deaths
,
the
partings
,
the
*NL*
yearnings
for
love
,
have
their
deepest
expression
in
the
*NL*
heart
of
the
fields
.
All
was
not
sadness
.
The
sun
was
*NL*
shining
without
.
The
thrush
sang
his
two
syllables
on
the
*NL*
budding
guelder-rose
.
Some
children
were
playing
*NL*
uproariously
in
heaps
of
golden
straw
.
It
was
the
presence
*NL*
of
sadness
at
all
that
surprised
Margaret
,
and
ended
by
*NL*
giving
her
a
feeling
of
completeness
.
In
these
English
*NL*
farms
,
if
anywhere
,
one
might
see
life
steadily
and
see
it
*NL*
whole
,
group
in
one
vision
its
transitoriness
and
its
*NL*
eternal
youth
,
connect
--
connect
without
bitterness
until
all
*NL*
men
are
brothers
.
But
her
thoughts
were
interrupted
by
the
*NL*
return
of
Miss
Avery
's
niece
,
and
were
so
tranquillizing
*NL*
that
she
suffered
the
interruption
gladly
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
quicker
to
go
out
by
the
back
door
,
and
,
after
*NL*
due
explanations
,
they
went
out
by
it
.
The
niece
was
now
*NL*
mortified
by
unnumerable
chickens
,
who
rushed
up
to
her
feet
*NL*
for
food
,
and
by
a
shameless
and
maternal
sow
.
She
did
not
*NL*
know
what
animals
were
coming
to
.
But
her
gentility
*NL*
withered
at
the
touch
of
the
sweet
air
.
The
wind
was
*NL*
rising
,
scattering
the
straw
and
ruffling
the
tails
of
the
*NL*
ducks
as
they
floated
in
families
over
Evie
's
pendant
.
One
*NL*
of
those
delicious
gales
of
spring
,
in
which
leaves
stiff
in
*NL*
bud
seem
to
rustle
,
swept
over
the
land
and
then
fell
*NL*
silent
.
``
Georgia
,
''
sang
the
thrush
.
``
Cuckoo
,
''
came
*NL*
furtively
from
the
cliff
of
pine-trees
.
``
Georgia
,
pretty
*NL*
Georgia
,
''
and
the
other
birds
joined
in
with
nonsense
.
The
*NL*
hedge
was
a
half-painted
picture
which
would
be
finished
in
*NL*
a
few
days
.
Celandines
grew
on
its
banks
,
lords
and
ladies
*NL*
and
primroses
in
the
defended
hollows
;
the
wild
rose-bushes
,
*NL*
still
bearing
their
withered
hips
,
showed
also
the
promise
*NL*
of
blossom
.
Spring
had
come
,
clad
in
no
classical
garb
,
yet
*NL*
fairer
than
all
springs
;
fairer
even
than
she
who
walks
*NL*
through
the
myrtles
of
Tuscany
with
the
graces
before
her
*NL*
and
the
zephyr
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
women
walked
up
the
lane
full
of
outward
*NL*
civility
.
But
Margaret
was
thinking
how
difficult
it
was
to
*NL*
be
earnest
about
furniture
on
such
a
day
,
and
the
niece
was
*NL*
thinking
about
hats
.
Thus
engaged
,
they
reached
Howards
*NL*
End
.
Petulant
cries
of
``
Auntie
!
''
severed
the
air
.
There
*NL*
was
no
reply
,
and
the
front
door
was
locked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
sure
that
Miss
Avery
is
up
here
?
''
asked
Margaret
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
Mrs.
Wilcox
,
quite
sure
.
She
is
here
daily
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
tried
to
look
in
through
the
dining-room
*NL*
window
,
but
the
curtain
inside
was
drawn
tightly
.
So
with
*NL*
the
drawing-room
and
the
hall
.
The
appearance
of
these
*NL*
curtains
was
familiar
,
yet
she
did
not
remember
them
being
*NL*
there
on
her
other
visit
:
her
impression
was
that
Mr.
Bryce
*NL*
had
taken
everything
away
.
They
tried
the
back
.
Here
again
*NL*
they
received
no
answer
,
and
could
see
nothing
;
the
*NL*
kitchen-window
was
fitted
with
a
blind
,
while
the
pantry
and
*NL*
scullery
had
pieces
of
wood
propped
up
against
them
,
which
*NL*
looked
ominously
like
the
lids
of
packing-cases
.
Margaret
*NL*
thought
of
her
books
,
and
she
lifted
up
her
voice
also
.
At
*NL*
the
first
cry
she
succeeded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
!
''
replied
someone
inside
the
house
.
``
If
it
*NL*
is
n't
Mrs.
Wilcox
come
at
last
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
got
the
key
,
auntie
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madge
,
go
away
,

said
Miss
Avery
,
still
invisible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Auntie
,
it
's
Mrs.
Wilcox
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
supported
her
.
``
Your
niece
and
I
have
come
together

*NL*
*NL*
``
Madge

go
away

This
is
no
moment
for

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
woman
went
red
.
``
Auntie
gets
more
eccentric
*NL*
lately
,
''
she
said
nervously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Avery
!
''
called
Margaret
.
``
I
have
come
about
the
*NL*
furniture
.
Could
you
kindly
let
me
in
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Mrs.
Wilcox
,
''
said
the
voice
,
``
of
course
.
''
But
*NL*
after
that
came
silence
.
They
called
again
without
*NL*
response
.
They
walked
round
the
house
disconsolately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
Miss
Avery
is
not
ill
,
''
hazarded
Margaret
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
if
you
'll
excuse
me
,
''
said
Madge
,
``
perhaps
I
*NL*
ought
to
be
leaving
you
now
.
The
servants
need
seeing
to
at
*NL*
the
farm

Auntie
is
so
odd
at
times
.
''
Gathering
up
her
*NL*
elegancies
,
she
retired
defeated
,
and
,
as
if
her
departure
*NL*
had
loosed
a
spring
,
the
front
door
opened
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Avery
said
,
``
Well
,
come
right
in
,
Mrs.
Wilcox
!
''
*NL*
quite
pleasantly
and
calmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
so
much
,
''
began
Margaret
,
but
broke
off
at
*NL*
the
sight
of
an
umbrella-stand
.
It
was
her
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
right
into
the
hall
first
,
''
said
Miss
Avery
.
She
*NL*
drew
the
curtain
,
and
Margaret
uttered
a
cry
of
despair
.
*NL*
For
an
appalling
thing
had
happened
.
The
hall
was
fitted
up
*NL*
with
the
contents
of
the
library
from
Wickham
Place
.
The
*NL*
carpet
had
been
laid
,
the
big
work-table
drawn
up
near
the
*NL*
window
;
the
bookcases
filled
the
wall
opposite
the
*NL*
fireplace
,
and
her
father
's
sword
--
this
is
what
bewildered
*NL*
her
particularly
--
had
been
drawn
from
its
scabbard
and
hung
*NL*
naked
amongst
the
sober
volumes
.
Miss
Avery
must
have
*NL*
worked
for
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
afraid
this
is
n't
what
we
meant
,
''
she
began
.
``
Mr.
*NL*
Wilcox
and
I
never
intended
the
cases
to
be
touched
.
For
*NL*
instance
,
these
books
are
my
brother
's
.
We
are
storing
them
*NL*
for
him
and
for
my
sister
,
who
is
abroad
.
When
you
kindly
*NL*
undertook
to
look
after
things
,
we
never
expected
you
to
do
*NL*
so
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
house
has
been
empty
long
enough
,
''
said
the
old
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
refused
to
argue
.
``
I
dare
say
we
did
n't
*NL*
explain
,
''
she
said
civilly
.
``
It
has
been
a
mistake
,
and
*NL*
very
likely
our
mistake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Wilcox
,
it
has
been
mistake
upon
mistake
for
fifty
*NL*
years
.
The
house
is
Mrs.
Wilcox
's
,
and
she
would
not
desire
*NL*
it
to
stand
empty
any
longer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
help
the
poor
decaying
brain
,
Margaret
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Mrs.
Wilcox
's
house
,
the
mother
of
Mr.
Charles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mistake
upon
mistake
,
''
said
Miss
Avery
.
``
Mistake
upon
mistake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
Margaret
,
sitting
down
in
one
*NL*
of
her
own
chairs
.
``
I
really
do
n't
know
what
's
to
be
*NL*
done

''
She
could
not
help
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
said
:
``
Yes
,
it
should
be
a
merry
house
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
--
I
dare
say
.
Well
,
thank
you
very
much
,
*NL*
Miss
Avery
.
Yes
,
that
's
all
right
.
Delightful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
still
the
parlour
.
''
She
went
through
the
door
*NL*
opposite
and
drew
a
curtain
.
Light
flooded
the
drawing-room
*NL*
and
the
drawing-room
furniture
from
Wickham
Place
.
``
And
the
*NL*
dining-room
.
''
More
curtains
were
drawn
,
more
windows
were
*NL*
flung
open
to
the
spring
.
``
Then
through
here
--
''
Miss
Avery
*NL*
continued
passing
and
repassing
through
the
hall
.
Her
voice
*NL*
was
lost
,
but
Margaret
heard
her
pulling
up
the
kitchen
*NL*
blind
.
``
I
've
not
finished
here
yet
,
''
she
announced
,
*NL*
returning
.
``
There
's
still
a
deal
to
do
.
The
farm
lads
will
*NL*
carry
your
great
wardrobes
upstairs
,
for
there
is
no
need
to
*NL*
go
into
expense
at
Hilton
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
all
a
mistake
,
''
repeated
Margaret
,
feeling
that
*NL*
she
must
put
her
foot
down
.
``
A
misunderstanding
.
Mr.
*NL*
Wilcox
and
I
are
not
going
to
live
at
Howards
End
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
indeed
.
On
account
of
his
hay
fever
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
settled
to
build
a
new
home
for
ourselves
in
*NL*
Sussex
,
and
part
of
this
furniture
--
my
part
--
will
go
down
*NL*
there
presently
.
''
She
looked
at
Miss
Avery
intently
,
trying
*NL*
to
understand
the
kink
in
her
brain
.
Here
was
no
maundering
*NL*
old
woman
.
Her
wrinkles
were
shrewd
and
humorous
.
She
*NL*
looked
capable
of
scathing
wit
and
also
of
high
but
*NL*
unostentatious
nobility
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
think
that
you
wo
n't
come
back
to
live
here
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Wilcox
,
but
you
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
remains
to
be
seen
,
''
said
Margaret
,
smiling
.
``
We
*NL*
have
no
intention
of
doing
so
for
the
present
.
We
happen
to
*NL*
need
a
much
larger
house
.
Circumstances
oblige
us
to
give
*NL*
big
parties
.
Of
course
,
some
day
--
one
never
knows
,
does
one
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Avery
retorted
:
``
Some
day
!
Tcha
!
tcha
!
Do
n't
*NL*
talk
about
some
day
.
You
are
living
here
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Am
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
living
here
,
and
have
been
for
the
last
ten
*NL*
minutes
,
if
you
ask
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
senseless
remark
,
but
with
a
queer
feeling
of
*NL*
disloyalty
Margaret
rose
from
her
chair
.
She
felt
that
*NL*
Henry
had
been
obscurely
censured
.
They
went
into
the
*NL*
dining-room
,
where
the
sunlight
poured
in
upon
her
mother
's
*NL*
chiffonier
,
and
upstairs
,
where
many
an
old
god
peeped
from
*NL*
a
new
niche
.
The
furniture
fitted
extraordinarily
well
.
In
*NL*
the
central
room
--
over
the
hall
,
the
room
that
Helen
had
*NL*
slept
in
four
years
ago
--
Miss
Avery
had
placed
Tibby
's
old
*NL*
bassinette
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
nursery
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
turned
away
without
speaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
everything
was
seen
.
The
kitchen
and
lobby
were
*NL*
still
stacked
with
furniture
and
straw
,
but
,
as
far
as
she
*NL*
could
make
out
,
nothing
had
been
broken
or
scratched
.
A
*NL*
pathetic
display
of
ingenuity
!
Then
they
took
a
friendly
*NL*
stroll
in
the
garden
.
It
had
gone
wild
since
her
last
*NL*
visit
.
The
gravel
sweep
was
weedy
,
and
grass
had
sprung
up
*NL*
at
the
very
jaws
of
the
garage
.
And
Evie
's
rockery
was
only
*NL*
bumps
.
Perhaps
Evie
was
responsible
for
Miss
Avery
's
*NL*
oddness
.
But
Margaret
suspected
that
the
cause
lay
deeper
,
*NL*
and
that
the
girl
's
silly
letter
had
but
loosed
the
*NL*
irritation
of
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
beautiful
meadow
,
''
she
remarked
.
It
was
one
of
*NL*
those
open-air
drawing-rooms
that
have
been
formed
,
hundreds
*NL*
of
years
ago
,
out
of
the
smaller
fields
.
So
the
boundary
*NL*
hedge
zigzagged
down
the
hill
at
right
angles
,
and
at
the
*NL*
bottom
there
was
a
little
green
annex
--
a
sort
of
*NL*
powder-closet
for
the
cows
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
the
maidy
's
well
enough
,
''
said
Miss
Avery
,
``
for
*NL*
those
that
is
,
who
do
n't
suffer
from
sneezing
.
''
And
she
*NL*
cackled
maliciously
.
``
I
've
seen
Charlie
Wilcox
go
out
to
my
*NL*
lads
in
hay
time
--
oh
,
they
ought
to
do
this
--
they
must
n't
do
*NL*
that
--
he
'd
learn
them
to
be
lads
.
And
just
then
the
*NL*
tickling
took
him
.
He
has
it
from
his
father
,
with
other
*NL*
things
.
There
's
not
one
Wilcox
that
can
stand
up
against
a
*NL*
field
in
June
--
I
laughed
fit
to
burst
while
he
was
courting
Ruth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
brother
gets
hay
fever
too
,
''
said
Margaret
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
house
lies
too
much
on
the
land
for
them
.
*NL*
Naturally
,
they
were
glad
enough
to
slip
in
at
first
.
But
*NL*
Wilcoxes
are
better
than
nothing
,
as
I
see
you
've
found
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
keep
a
place
going
,
do
n't
they
?
Yes
,
it
is
just
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
keep
England
going
,
it
is
my
opinion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Miss
Avery
upset
her
by
replying
:
``
Ay
,
they
breed
*NL*
like
rabbits
.
Well
,
well
,
it
's
a
funny
world
.
But
He
who
*NL*
made
it
knows
what
He
wants
in
it
,
I
suppose
.
If
Mrs.
*NL*
Charlie
is
expecting
her
fourth
,
it
is
n't
for
us
to
repine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
breed
and
they
also
work
,
''
said
Margaret
,
*NL*
conscious
of
some
invitation
to
disloyalty
,
which
was
echoed
*NL*
by
the
very
breeze
and
by
the
songs
of
the
birds
.
``
It
*NL*
certainly
is
a
funny
world
,
but
so
long
as
men
like
my
*NL*
husband
and
his
sons
govern
it
,
I
think
it
'll
never
be
a
bad
*NL*
one
--
never
really
bad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
better
'n
nothing
,
''
said
Miss
Avery
,
and
turned
to
*NL*
the
wych-elm
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
their
way
back
to
the
farm
she
spoke
of
her
old
*NL*
friend
much
more
clearly
than
before
.
In
the
house
Margaret
*NL*
had
wondered
whether
she
quite
distinguished
the
first
wife
*NL*
from
the
second
.
Now
she
said
:
``
I
never
saw
much
of
Ruth
*NL*
after
her
grandmother
died
,
but
we
stayed
civil
.
It
was
a
*NL*
very
civil
family
.
Old
Mrs.
Howard
never
spoke
against
*NL*
anybody
,
nor
let
anyone
be
turned
away
without
food
.
Then
*NL*
it
was
never
`
Trespassers
will
be
prosecuted
'
in
their
land
,
*NL*
but
would
people
please
not
come
in
.
Mrs.
Howard
was
never
*NL*
created
to
run
a
farm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Had
they
no
men
to
help
them
?
''
Margaret
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Avery
replied
:
``
Things
went
on
until
there
were
no
men
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Until
Mr.
Wilcox
came
along
,
''
corrected
Margaret
,
*NL*
anxious
that
her
husband
should
receive
his
dues
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
so
;
but
Ruth
should
have
married
a
--
no
*NL*
disrespect
to
you
to
say
this
,
for
I
take
it
you
were
*NL*
intended
to
get
Wilcox
any
way
,
whether
she
got
him
first
or
*NL*
no
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whom
should
she
have
married
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
soldier
!
''
exclaimed
the
old
woman
.
``
Some
real
soldier
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
was
silent
.
It
was
a
criticism
of
Henry
's
*NL*
character
far
more
trenchant
than
any
of
her
own
.
She
felt
*NL*
dissatisfied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
that
's
all
over
,
''
she
went
on
.
``
A
better
time
is
*NL*
coming
now
,
though
you
've
kept
me
long
enough
waiting
.
In
a
*NL*
couple
of
weeks
I
'll
see
your
lights
shining
through
the
*NL*
hedge
of
an
evening
.
Have
you
ordered
in
coals
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
not
coming
,
''
said
Margaret
firmly
.
She
*NL*
respected
Miss
Avery
too
much
to
humour
her
.
``
No
.
Not
*NL*
coming
.
Never
coming
.
It
has
all
been
a
mistake
.
The
*NL*
furniture
must
be
repacked
at
once
,
and
I
am
very
sorry
but
*NL*
I
am
making
other
arrangements
,
and
must
ask
you
to
give
me
*NL*
the
keys
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
Mrs.
Wilcox
,
''
said
Miss
Avery
,
and
resigned
*NL*
her
duties
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
Relieved
at
this
conclusion
,
and
having
sent
her
*NL*
compliments
to
Madge
,
Margaret
walked
back
to
the
station
.
*NL*
She
had
intended
to
go
to
the
furniture
warehouse
and
give
*NL*
directions
for
removal
,
but
the
muddle
had
turned
out
more
*NL*
extensive
than
she
expected
,
so
she
decided
to
consult
*NL*
Henry
.
It
was
as
well
that
she
did
this
.
He
was
strongly
*NL*
against
employing
the
local
man
whom
he
had
previously
*NL*
recommended
,
and
advised
her
to
store
in
London
after
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
before
this
could
be
done
an
unexpected
trouble
fell
*NL*
upon
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
34
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
unexpected
entirely
.
Aunt
Juley
's
health
had
*NL*
been
bad
all
the
winter
.
She
had
had
a
long
series
of
colds
*NL*
and
coughs
,
and
had
been
too
busy
to
get
rid
of
them
.
She
*NL*
had
scarcely
promised
her
niece
``
to
really
take
my
tiresome
*NL*
chest
in
hand
,
''
when
she
caught
a
chill
and
developed
acute
*NL*
pneumonia
.
Margaret
and
Tibby
went
down
to
Swanage
.
Helen
*NL*
was
telegraphed
for
,
and
that
spring
party
that
after
all
*NL*
gathered
in
that
hospitable
house
had
all
the
pathos
of
fair
*NL*
memories
.
On
a
perfect
day
,
when
the
sky
seemed
blue
*NL*
porcelain
,
and
the
waves
of
the
discreet
little
bay
beat
*NL*
gentlest
of
tattoos
upon
the
sand
,
Margaret
hurried
up
*NL*
through
the
rhododendrons
,
confronted
again
by
the
*NL*
senselessness
of
Death
.
One
death
may
explain
itself
,
but
*NL*
it
throws
no
light
upon
another
:
the
groping
inquiry
must
*NL*
begin
anew
.
Preachers
or
scientists
may
generalize
,
but
we
*NL*
know
that
no
generality
is
possible
about
those
whom
we
*NL*
love
;
not
one
heaven
awaits
them
,
not
even
one
oblivion
.
*NL*
Aunt
Juley
,
incapable
of
tragedy
,
slipped
out
of
life
with
*NL*
odd
little
laughs
and
apologies
for
having
stopped
in
it
so
*NL*
long
.
She
was
very
weak
;
she
could
not
rise
to
the
*NL*
occasion
,
or
realize
the
great
mystery
which
all
agree
must
*NL*
await
her
;
it
only
seemed
to
her
that
she
was
quite
done
*NL*
up
--
more
done
up
than
ever
before
;
that
she
saw
and
heard
*NL*
and
felt
less
every
moment
;
and
that
,
unless
something
*NL*
changed
,
she
would
soon
feel
nothing
.
Her
spare
strength
*NL*
she
devoted
to
plans
:
could
not
Margaret
take
some
steamer
*NL*
expeditions
?
were
mackerel
cooked
as
Tibby
liked
them
?
She
*NL*
worried
herself
about
Helen
's
absence
,
and
also
that
she
*NL*
could
be
the
cause
of
Helen
's
return
.
The
nurses
seemed
to
*NL*
think
such
interests
quite
natural
,
and
perhaps
hers
was
an
*NL*
average
approach
to
the
Great
Gate
.
But
Margaret
saw
Death
*NL*
stripped
of
any
false
romance
;
whatever
the
idea
of
Death
*NL*
may
contain
,
the
process
can
be
trivial
and
hideous
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Important
--
Margaret
dear
,
take
the
Lulworth
when
Helen
comes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Helen
wo
n't
be
able
to
stop
,
Aunt
Juley
.
She
has
*NL*
telegraphed
that
she
can
only
get
away
just
to
see
you
.
She
*NL*
must
go
back
to
Germany
as
soon
as
you
are
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
very
odd
of
Helen
!
Mr.
Wilcox
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
dear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
he
spare
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henry
wished
her
to
come
,
and
had
been
very
kind
.
Yet
*NL*
again
Margaret
said
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Munt
did
not
die
.
Quite
outside
her
will
,
a
more
*NL*
dignified
power
took
hold
of
her
and
checked
her
on
the
*NL*
downward
slope
.
She
returned
,
without
emotion
,
as
fidgety
*NL*
as
ever
.
On
the
fourth
day
she
was
out
of
danger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Margaret
--
important
,
''
it
went
on
:
``
I
should
like
you
to
*NL*
have
some
companion
to
take
walks
with
.
Do
try
Miss
Conder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
a
little
walk
with
Miss
Conder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
she
is
not
really
interesting
.
If
only
you
had
Helen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
Tibby
,
Aunt
Juley
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
but
he
has
to
do
his
Chinese
.
Some
real
companion
*NL*
is
what
you
need
.
Really
,
Helen
is
odd
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Helen
is
odd
,
very
,
''
agreed
Margaret
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
content
with
going
abroad
,
why
does
she
want
to
go
*NL*
back
there
at
once
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
doubt
she
will
change
her
mind
when
she
sees
us
.
*NL*
She
has
not
the
least
balance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
the
stock
criticism
about
Helen
,
but
Margaret
's
*NL*
voice
trembled
as
she
made
it
.
By
now
she
was
deeply
pained
*NL*
at
her
sister
's
behaviour
.
It
may
be
unbalanced
to
fly
out
*NL*
of
England
,
but
to
stop
away
eight
months
argues
that
the
*NL*
heart
is
awry
as
well
as
the
head
.
A
sick-bed
could
recall
*NL*
Helen
,
but
she
was
deaf
to
more
human
calls
;
after
a
glimpse
*NL*
at
her
aunt
,
she
would
retire
into
her
nebulous
life
behind
*NL*
some
poste
restante
.
She
scarcely
existed
;
her
letters
had
*NL*
become
dull
and
infrequent
;
she
had
no
wants
and
no
*NL*
curiosity
.
And
it
was
all
put
down
to
poor
Henry
's
*NL*
account
!
Henry
,
long
pardoned
by
his
wife
,
was
still
too
*NL*
infamous
to
be
greeted
by
his
sister-in-law
.
It
was
morbid
,
*NL*
and
,
to
her
alarm
,
Margaret
fancied
that
she
could
trace
the
*NL*
growth
of
morbidity
back
in
Helen
's
life
for
nearly
four
*NL*
years
.
The
flight
from
Oniton
;
the
unbalanced
patronage
of
*NL*
the
Basts
;
the
explosion
of
grief
up
on
the
Downs
--
all
*NL*
connected
with
Paul
,
an
insignificant
boy
whose
lips
had
*NL*
kissed
hers
for
a
fraction
of
time
.
Margaret
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Wilcox
had
feared
that
they
might
kiss
again
.
Foolishly
:
*NL*
the
real
danger
was
reaction
.
Reaction
against
the
Wilcoxes
*NL*
had
eaten
into
her
life
until
she
was
scarcely
sane
.
At
*NL*
twenty-five
she
had
an
idee
fixe
.
What
hope
was
there
for
*NL*
her
as
an
old
woman
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
more
Margaret
thought
about
it
the
more
alarmed
she
*NL*
became
.
For
many
months
she
had
put
the
subject
away
,
but
*NL*
it
was
too
big
to
be
slighted
now
.
There
was
almost
a
taint
*NL*
of
madness
.
Were
all
Helen
's
actions
to
be
governed
by
a
*NL*
tiny
mishap
,
such
as
may
happen
to
any
young
man
or
woman
?
*NL*
Can
human
nature
be
constructed
on
lines
so
insignificant
?
*NL*
The
blundering
little
encounter
at
Howards
End
was
vital
.
*NL*
It
propagated
itself
where
graver
intercourse
lay
barren
;
it
*NL*
was
stronger
than
sisterly
intimacy
,
stronger
than
reason
or
*NL*
books
.
In
one
of
her
moods
Helen
had
confessed
that
she
*NL*
still
``
enjoyed
''
it
in
a
certain
sense
.
Paul
had
faded
,
but
*NL*
the
magic
of
his
caress
endured
.
And
where
there
is
*NL*
enjoyment
of
the
past
there
may
also
be
*NL*
reaction
--
propagation
at
both
ends
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
it
is
odd
and
sad
that
our
minds
should
be
such
*NL*
seed-beds
,
and
we
without
power
to
choose
the
seed
.
But
man
*NL*
is
an
odd
,
sad
creature
as
yet
,
intent
on
pilfering
the
*NL*
earth
,
and
heedless
of
the
growths
within
himself
.
He
*NL*
can
not
be
bored
about
psychology
.
He
leaves
it
to
the
*NL*
specialist
,
which
is
as
if
he
should
leave
his
dinner
to
be
*NL*
eaten
by
a
steam-engine
.
He
can
not
be
bothered
to
digest
*NL*
his
own
soul
.
Margaret
and
Helen
have
been
more
patient
,
*NL*
and
it
is
suggested
that
Margaret
has
succeeded
--
so
far
as
*NL*
success
is
yet
possible
.
She
does
understand
herself
,
she
*NL*
has
some
rudimentary
control
over
her
own
growth
.
Whether
*NL*
Helen
has
succeeded
one
can
not
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
that
Mrs.
Munt
rallied
Helen
's
letter
arrived
.
*NL*
She
had
posted
it
at
Munich
,
and
would
be
in
London
herself
*NL*
on
the
morrow
.
It
was
a
disquieting
letter
,
though
the
*NL*
opening
was
affectionate
and
sane
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Dearest
Meg
,
*NL*
*NL*
Give
Helen
's
love
to
Aunt
Juley
.
Tell
her
that
I
*NL*
love
,
and
have
loved
,
her
ever
since
I
can
remember
.
I
*NL*
shall
be
in
London
Thursday
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
address
will
be
care
of
the
bankers
.
I
have
not
*NL*
yet
settled
on
a
hotel
,
so
write
or
wire
to
me
there
and
*NL*
give
me
detailed
news
.
If
Aunt
Juley
is
much
better
,
or
*NL*
if
,
for
a
terrible
reason
,
it
would
be
no
good
my
coming
*NL*
down
to
Swanage
,
you
must
not
think
it
odd
if
I
do
not
*NL*
come
.
I
have
all
sorts
of
plans
in
my
head
.
I
am
living
*NL*
abroad
at
present
,
and
want
to
get
back
as
quickly
as
*NL*
possible
.
Will
you
please
tell
me
where
our
furniture
*NL*
is
.
I
should
like
to
take
out
one
or
two
books
;
the
rest
*NL*
are
for
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
Forgive
me
,
dearest
Meg
.
This
must
read
like
rather
*NL*
a
tiresome
letter
,
but
all
letters
are
from
your
loving
*NL*
*NL*
Helen
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
tiresome
letter
,
for
it
tempted
Margaret
to
*NL*
tell
a
lie
.
If
she
wrote
that
Aunt
Juley
was
still
in
*NL*
danger
her
sister
would
come
.
Unhealthiness
is
contagious
.
*NL*
We
can
not
be
in
contact
with
those
who
are
in
a
morbid
state
*NL*
without
ourselves
deteriorating
.
To
``
act
for
the
best
''
*NL*
might
do
Helen
good
,
but
would
do
herself
harm
,
and
,
at
the
*NL*
risk
of
disaster
,
she
kept
her
colours
flying
a
little
*NL*
longer
.
She
replied
that
their
aunt
was
much
better
,
and
*NL*
awaited
developments
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tibby
approved
of
her
reply
.
Mellowing
rapidly
,
he
was
*NL*
a
pleasanter
companion
than
before
.
Oxford
had
done
much
*NL*
for
him
.
He
had
lost
his
peevishness
,
and
could
hide
his
*NL*
indifference
to
people
and
his
interest
in
food
.
But
he
had
*NL*
not
grown
more
human
.
The
years
between
eighteen
and
*NL*
twenty-two
,
so
magical
for
most
,
were
leading
him
gently
*NL*
from
boyhood
to
middle
age
.
He
had
never
known
*NL*
young-manliness
,
that
quality
which
warms
the
heart
till
*NL*
death
,
and
gives
Mr.
Wilcox
an
imperishable
charm
.
He
was
*NL*
frigid
,
through
no
fault
of
his
own
,
and
without
cruelty
.
*NL*
He
thought
Helen
wrong
and
Margaret
right
,
but
the
family
*NL*
trouble
was
for
him
what
a
scene
behind
footlights
is
for
*NL*
most
people
.
He
had
only
one
suggestion
to
make
,
and
that
*NL*
was
characteristic
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
tell
Mr.
Wilcox
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
Helen
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
he
has
come
across
that
sort
of
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
would
do
all
he
could
,
but
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
know
best
.
But
he
is
practical
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
student
's
belief
in
experts
.
Margaret
*NL*
demurred
for
one
or
two
reasons
.
Presently
Helen
's
answer
*NL*
came
.
She
sent
a
telegram
requesting
the
address
of
the
*NL*
furniture
,
as
she
would
now
return
at
once
.
Margaret
*NL*
replied
,
``
Certainly
not
;
meet
me
at
the
bankers
at
four
.
''
*NL*
She
and
Tibby
went
up
to
London
.
Helen
was
not
at
the
*NL*
bankers
,
and
they
were
refused
her
address
.
Helen
had
*NL*
passed
into
chaos
.
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
put
her
arm
round
her
brother
.
He
was
all
that
*NL*
she
had
left
,
and
never
had
he
seemed
more
unsubstantial
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tibby
love
,
what
next
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
replied
:
``
It
is
extraordinary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
,
your
judgment
's
often
clearer
than
mine
.
Have
*NL*
you
any
notion
what
's
at
the
back
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
None
,
unless
it
's
something
mental
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
that
!
''
said
Margaret
.
``
Quite
impossible
.
''
But
the
*NL*
suggestion
had
been
uttered
,
and
in
a
few
minutes
she
took
*NL*
it
up
herself
.
Nothing
else
explained
.
And
London
agreed
*NL*
with
Tibby
.
The
mask
fell
off
the
city
,
and
she
saw
it
for
*NL*
what
it
really
is
--
a
caricature
of
infinity
.
The
familiar
*NL*
barriers
,
the
streets
along
which
she
moved
,
the
houses
*NL*
between
which
she
had
made
her
little
journeys
for
so
many
*NL*
years
,
became
negligible
suddenly
.
Helen
seemed
one
with
*NL*
grimy
trees
and
the
traffic
and
the
slowly-flowing
slabs
of
*NL*
mud
.
She
had
accomplished
a
hideous
act
of
renunciation
and
*NL*
returned
to
the
One
.
Margaret
's
own
faith
held
firm
.
She
*NL*
knew
the
human
soul
will
be
merged
,
if
it
be
merged
at
all
,
*NL*
with
the
stars
and
the
sea
.
Yet
she
felt
that
her
sister
*NL*
had
been
going
amiss
for
many
years
.
It
was
symbolic
the
*NL*
catastrophe
should
come
now
,
on
a
London
afternoon
,
while
*NL*
rain
fell
slowly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henry
was
the
only
hope
.
Henry
was
definite
.
He
might
*NL*
know
of
some
paths
in
the
chaos
that
were
hidden
from
them
,
*NL*
and
she
determined
to
take
Tibby
's
advice
and
lay
the
whole
*NL*
matter
in
his
hands
.
They
must
call
at
his
office
.
He
*NL*
could
not
well
make
it
worse
.
She
went
for
a
few
moments
*NL*
into
St.
Paul
's
,
whose
dome
stands
out
of
the
welter
so
*NL*
bravely
,
as
if
preaching
the
gospel
of
form
.
But
within
,
*NL*
St.
Paul
's
is
as
its
surroundings
--
echoes
and
whispers
,
*NL*
inaudible
songs
,
invisible
mosaics
,
wet
footmarks
crossing
*NL*
and
recrossing
the
floor
.
Si
monumentum
requiris
,
*NL*
circumspice
:
it
points
us
back
to
London
.
There
was
no
hope
*NL*
of
Helen
here
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henry
was
unsatisfactory
at
first
.
That
she
had
*NL*
expected
.
He
was
overjoyed
to
see
her
back
from
Swanage
,
*NL*
and
slow
to
admit
the
growth
of
a
new
trouble
.
When
they
*NL*
told
him
of
their
search
,
he
only
chaffed
Tibby
and
the
*NL*
Schlegels
generally
,
and
declared
that
it
was
``
just
like
*NL*
Helen
''
to
lead
her
relatives
a
dance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
what
we
all
say
,
''
replied
Margaret
.
``
But
why
*NL*
should
it
be
just
like
Helen
?
Why
should
she
be
allowed
to
*NL*
be
so
queer
,
and
to
grow
queerer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
ask
me
.
I
'm
a
plain
man
of
business
.
I
live
and
*NL*
let
live
.
My
advice
to
you
both
is
,
do
n't
worry
.
Margaret
,
*NL*
you
've
got
black
marks
again
under
your
eyes
.
You
know
*NL*
that
's
strictly
forbidden
.
First
your
aunt
--
then
your
*NL*
sister
.
No
,
we
are
n't
going
to
have
it
.
Are
we
,
*NL*
Theobald
?
''
He
rang
the
bell
.
``
I
'll
give
you
some
tea
,
and
*NL*
then
you
go
straight
to
Ducie
Street
.
I
ca
n't
have
my
girl
*NL*
looking
as
old
as
her
husband
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
the
same
,
you
have
not
quite
seen
our
point
,
''
said
Tibby
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Wilcox
,
who
was
in
good
spirits
,
retorted
,
``
I
do
n't
*NL*
suppose
I
ever
shall
.
''
He
leant
back
,
laughing
at
the
*NL*
gifted
but
ridiculous
family
,
while
the
fire
flickered
over
*NL*
the
map
of
Africa
.
Margaret
motioned
to
her
brother
to
go
*NL*
on
.
Rather
diffident
,
he
obeyed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Margaret
's
point
is
this
,
''
he
said
.
``
Our
sister
may
be
*NL*
mad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
,
who
was
working
in
the
inner
room
,
looked
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
in
,
Charles
,
''
said
Margaret
kindly
.
``
Could
you
*NL*
help
us
at
all
?
We
are
again
in
trouble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
afraid
I
can
not
.
What
are
the
facts
?
We
are
all
*NL*
mad
more
or
less
,
you
know
,
in
these
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
facts
are
as
follows
,
''
replied
Tibby
,
who
had
at
*NL*
times
a
pedantic
lucidity
.
``
The
facts
are
that
she
has
been
*NL*
in
England
for
three
days
and
will
not
see
us
.
She
has
*NL*
forbidden
the
bankers
to
give
us
her
address
.
She
refuses
*NL*
to
answer
questions
.
Margaret
finds
her
letters
*NL*
colourless
.
There
are
other
facts
,
but
these
are
the
most
*NL*
striking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
never
behaved
like
this
before
,
then
?
''
asked
Henry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
not
!
''
said
his
wife
,
with
a
frown
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
dear
,
how
am
I
to
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
senseless
spasm
of
annoyance
came
over
her
.
``
You
know
*NL*
quite
well
that
Helen
never
sins
against
affection
,
''
she
*NL*
said
.
``
You
must
have
noticed
that
much
in
her
,
surely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
;
she
and
I
have
always
hit
it
off
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Henry
--
ca
n't
you
see
?
--
I
do
n't
mean
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
recovered
herself
,
but
not
before
Charles
had
*NL*
observed
her
.
Stupid
and
attentive
,
he
was
watching
the
scene
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
meaning
that
when
she
was
eccentric
in
the
past
,
*NL*
one
could
trace
it
back
to
the
heart
in
the
long
run
.
She
*NL*
behaved
oddly
because
she
cared
for
someone
,
or
wanted
to
*NL*
help
them
.
There
's
no
possible
excuse
for
her
now
.
She
is
*NL*
grieving
us
deeply
,
and
that
is
why
I
am
sure
that
she
is
*NL*
not
well
.
`
Mad
'
is
too
terrible
a
word
,
but
she
is
not
*NL*
well
.
I
shall
never
believe
it
.
I
should
n't
discuss
my
*NL*
sister
with
you
if
I
thought
she
was
well
--
trouble
you
about
*NL*
her
,
I
mean
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henry
began
to
grow
serious
.
Ill-health
was
to
him
*NL*
something
perfectly
definite
.
Generally
well
himself
,
he
*NL*
could
not
realize
that
we
sink
to
it
by
slow
gradations
.
*NL*
The
sick
had
no
rights
;
they
were
outside
the
pale
;
one
*NL*
could
lie
to
them
remorselessly
.
When
his
first
wife
was
*NL*
seized
,
he
had
promised
to
take
her
down
into
Hertfordshire
,
*NL*
but
meanwhile
arranged
with
a
nursing-home
instead
.
Helen
,
*NL*
too
,
was
ill
.
And
the
plan
that
he
sketched
out
for
her
*NL*
capture
,
clever
and
well-meaning
as
it
was
,
drew
its
ethics
*NL*
from
the
wolf-pack
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
want
to
get
hold
of
her
?
''
he
said
.
``
That
's
the
*NL*
problem
,
is
n't
it
?
She
has
got
to
see
a
doctor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
all
I
know
she
has
seen
one
already
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
;
do
n't
interrupt
.
''
He
rose
to
his
feet
and
*NL*
thought
intently
.
The
genial
,
tentative
host
disappeared
,
*NL*
and
they
saw
instead
the
man
who
had
carved
money
out
of
*NL*
Greece
and
Africa
,
and
bought
forests
from
the
natives
for
a
*NL*
few
bottles
of
gin
.
``
I
've
got
it
,
''
he
said
at
last
.
``
It
's
*NL*
perfectly
easy
.
Leave
it
to
me
.
We
'll
send
her
down
to
*NL*
Howards
End
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
will
you
do
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
her
books
.
Tell
her
that
she
must
unpack
them
*NL*
herself
.
Then
you
can
meet
her
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Henry
,
that
's
just
what
she
wo
n't
let
me
do
.
It
's
*NL*
part
of
her
--
whatever
it
is
--
never
to
see
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
you
wo
n't
tell
her
you
're
going
.
When
she
is
*NL*
there
,
looking
at
the
cases
,
you
'll
just
stroll
in
.
If
*NL*
nothing
is
wrong
with
her
,
so
much
the
better
.
But
there
'll
*NL*
be
the
motor
round
the
corner
,
and
we
can
run
her
up
to
a
*NL*
specialist
in
no
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
shook
her
head
.
``
It
's
quite
impossible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
does
n't
seem
impossible
to
me
,
''
said
Tibby
;
``
it
is
*NL*
surely
a
very
tippy
plan
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
impossible
,
because
--
''
She
looked
at
her
husband
*NL*
sadly
.
``
It
's
not
the
particular
language
that
Helen
and
I
*NL*
talk
if
you
see
my
meaning
.
It
would
do
splendidly
for
*NL*
other
people
,
whom
I
do
n't
blame
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
Helen
does
n't
talk
,
''
said
Tibby
.
``
That
's
our
whole
*NL*
difficulty
.
She
wo
n't
talk
your
particular
language
,
and
on
*NL*
that
account
you
think
she
's
ill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Henry
;
it
's
sweet
of
you
,
but
I
could
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
,
''
he
said
;
``
you
have
scruples
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
sooner
than
go
against
them
you
would
have
your
*NL*
sister
suffer
.
You
could
have
got
her
down
to
Swanage
by
a
*NL*
word
,
but
you
had
scruples
.
And
scruples
are
all
very
*NL*
well
.
I
am
as
scrupulous
as
any
man
alive
,
I
hope
;
but
when
*NL*
it
is
a
case
like
this
,
when
there
is
a
question
of
madness
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
deny
it
's
madness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
said
just
now
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
madness
when
I
say
it
,

not
when
you
say
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
Henry
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
``
Margaret
!
Margaret
!
''
he
*NL*
groaned
.
``
No
education
can
teach
a
woman
logic

Now

dear

my
time
is
valuable

*NL*
``
Not

``

Plain
question

Do

''
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
surprised
them
by
interrupting
.
``
Pater
,
we
may
*NL*
as
well
keep
Howards
End
out
of
it
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Charles
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
could
give
no
reason
;
but
Margaret
felt
as
if
,
*NL*
over
tremendous
distance
,
a
salutation
had
passed
between
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
whole
house
is
at
sixes
and
sevens
,
''
he
said
*NL*
crossly
.
``
We
do
n't
want
any
more
mess
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
`
we
'
?
''
asked
his
father
.
``
My
boy
,
pray
,
who
's
`
we
'
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
I
beg
your
pardon
,
''
said
Charles
.
``
I
appear
*NL*
always
to
be
intruding
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
now
Margaret
wished
she
had
never
mentioned
her
*NL*
trouble
to
her
husband
.
Retreat
was
impossible
.
He
was
*NL*
determined
to
push
the
matter
to
a
satisfactory
conclusion
,
*NL*
and
Helen
faded
as
he
talked
.
Her
fair
,
flying
hair
and
*NL*
eager
eyes
counted
for
nothing
,
for
she
was
ill
,
without
*NL*
rights
,
and
any
of
her
friends
might
hunt
her
.
Sick
at
*NL*
heart
,
Margaret
joined
in
the
chase
.
She
wrote
her
sister
a
*NL*
lying
letter
,
at
her
husband
's
dictation
;
she
said
the
*NL*
furniture
was
all
at
Howards
End
,
but
could
be
seen
on
*NL*
Monday
next
at
3
p.m.
,
when
a
charwoman
would
be
in
*NL*
attendance
.
It
was
a
cold
letter
,
and
the
more
plausible
*NL*
for
that
.
Helen
would
think
she
was
offended
.
And
on
*NL*
Monday
next
she
and
Henry
were
to
lunch
with
Dolly
,
and
then
*NL*
ambush
themselves
in
the
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
they
had
gone
,
Mr.
Wilcox
said
to
his
son
:
``
I
*NL*
ca
n't
have
this
sort
of
behaviour
,
my
boy
.
Margaret
's
too
*NL*
sweet-natured
to
mind
,
but
I
mind
for
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
made
no
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
anything
wrong
with
you
,
Charles
,
this
afternoon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

pater
;
but
you
may
be
taking
on
a
bigger
business
*NL*
than
you
reckon
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
ask
me

*NL*
Chapter
35
*NL*
*NL*
One
speaks
of
the
moods
of
spring
,
but
the
days
that
are
her
*NL*
true
children
have
only
one
mood
;
they
are
all
full
of
the
*NL*
rising
and
dropping
of
winds
,
and
the
whistling
of
birds
.
*NL*
New
flowers
may
come
out
,
the
green
embroidery
of
the
hedges
*NL*
increase
,
but
the
same
heaven
broods
overhead
,
soft
,
thick
,
*NL*
and
blue
,
the
same
figures
,
seen
and
unseen
,
are
wandering
*NL*
by
coppice
and
meadow
.
The
morning
that
Margaret
had
spent
*NL*
with
Miss
Avery
,
and
the
afternoon
she
set
out
to
entrap
*NL*
Helen
,
were
the
scales
of
a
single
balance
.
Time
might
*NL*
never
have
moved
,
rain
never
have
fallen
,
and
man
alone
,
*NL*
with
his
schemes
and
ailments
,
was
troubling
Nature
until
he
*NL*
saw
her
through
a
veil
of
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
protested
no
more
.
Whether
Henry
was
right
or
*NL*
wrong
,
he
was
most
kind
,
and
she
knew
of
no
other
standard
*NL*
by
which
to
judge
him
.
She
must
trust
him
absolutely
.
As
*NL*
soon
as
he
had
taken
up
a
business
,
his
obtuseness
*NL*
vanished
.
He
profited
by
the
slightest
indications
,
and
the
*NL*
capture
of
Helen
promised
to
be
staged
as
deftly
as
the
*NL*
marriage
of
Evie
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
down
in
the
morning
as
arranged
,
and
he
*NL*
discovered
that
their
victim
was
actually
in
Hilton
.
On
his
*NL*
arrival
he
called
at
all
the
livery-stables
in
the
village
,
*NL*
and
had
a
few
minutes
'
serious
conversation
with
the
*NL*
proprietors
.
What
he
said
,
Margaret
did
not
know
--
perhaps
*NL*
not
the
truth
;
but
news
arrived
after
lunch
that
a
lady
had
*NL*
come
by
the
London
train
,
and
had
taken
a
fly
to
Howards
End
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
was
bound
to
drive
,
''
said
Henry
.
``
There
will
be
*NL*
her
books
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
make
it
out
,
''
said
Margaret
for
the
hundredth
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Finish
your
coffee
,
dear
.
We
must
be
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Margaret
,
you
know
you
must
take
plenty
,
''
said
Dolly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
tried
,
but
suddenly
lifted
her
hand
to
her
*NL*
eyes
.
Dolly
stole
glances
at
her
father-in-law
which
he
did
*NL*
not
answer
.
In
the
silence
the
motor
came
round
to
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
not
fit
for
it
,
''
he
said
anxiously
.
``
Let
me
go
*NL*
alone
.
I
know
exactly
what
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
I
am
fit
,
''
said
Margaret
,
uncovering
her
face
.
*NL*
``
Only
most
frightfully
worried
.
I
can
not
feel
that
Helen
is
*NL*
really
alive
.
Her
letters
and
telegrams
seem
to
have
come
*NL*
from
someone
else
.
Her
voice
is
n't
in
them
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
believe
your
driver
really
saw
her
at
the
station
.
I
wish
*NL*
I
'd
never
mentioned
it
.
I
know
that
Charles
is
vexed
.
Yes
,
*NL*
he
is
--
''
She
seized
Dolly
's
hand
and
kissed
it
.
``
There
,
*NL*
Dolly
will
forgive
me
.
There
.
Now
we
'll
be
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henry
had
been
looking
at
her
closely
.
He
did
not
like
*NL*
this
breakdown
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
want
to
tidy
yourself
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
I
time
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
plenty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
to
the
lavatory
by
the
front
door
,
and
as
soon
*NL*
as
the
bolt
slipped
,
Mr.
Wilcox
said
quietly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dolly
,
I
'm
going
without
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dolly
's
eyes
lit
up
with
vulgar
excitement
.
She
*NL*
followed
him
on
tip-toe
out
to
the
car
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
her
I
thought
it
best

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Mr.
Wilcox
,
I
see

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
anything
you
like

All
right

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
car
started
well
,
and
with
ordinary
luck
would
have
*NL*
got
away
.
But
Porgly-woggles
,
who
was
playing
in
the
*NL*
garden
,
chose
this
moment
to
sit
down
in
the
middle
of
the
*NL*
path
.
Crane
,
in
trying
to
pass
him
,
ran
one
wheel
over
a
*NL*
bed
of
wallflowers
.
Dolly
screamed
.
Margaret
,
hearing
the
*NL*
noise
,
rushed
out
hatless
,
and
was
in
time
to
jump
on
the
*NL*
footboard
.
She
said
not
a
single
word
:
he
was
only
treating
*NL*
her
as
she
had
treated
Helen
,
and
her
rage
at
his
dishonesty
*NL*
only
helped
to
indicate
what
Helen
would
feel
against
them
.
*NL*
She
thought
,
``
I
deserve
it
:
I
am
punished
for
lowering
my
*NL*
colours
.
''
And
she
accepted
his
apologies
with
a
calmness
*NL*
that
astonished
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
still
consider
you
are
not
fit
for
it
,
''
he
kept
saying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
I
was
not
at
lunch
.
But
the
whole
thing
is
*NL*
spread
clearly
before
me
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
meaning
to
act
for
the
best
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
lend
me
your
scarf
,
will
you
?
This
wind
takes
*NL*
one
's
hair
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
dear
girl

Are
you
all
right
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
!
My
hands
have
stopped
trembling
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
have
quite
forgiven
me
?
Then
listen
.
Her
cab
*NL*
should
already
have
arrived
at
Howards
End
.
-LRB-
We
're
a
little
*NL*
late
,
but
no
matter
.
-RRB-
Our
first
move
will
be
to
send
it
down
*NL*
to
wait
at
the
farm
,
as
,
if
possible
,
one
does
n't
want
a
*NL*
scene
before
servants
.
A
certain
gentleman
''
--
he
pointed
at
*NL*
Crane
's
back
--
``
wo
n't
drive
in
,
but
will
wait
a
little
short
*NL*
of
the
front
gate

behind
the

.
Have
you
still
the
*NL*
keys
of
the
house

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
they
are

wanted

Do
you
remember
how
the

house
stands

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
If
we
do

we
can

into
the
garden

Our
object

*NL*
*NL*
Here
they
stopped
to
pick
up
the
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
just
saying
to
my
wife
,
Mansbridge
,
that
our
main
*NL*
object
is
not
to
frighten
Miss
Schlegel
.
The
house
,
as
you
*NL*
know
,
is
my
property
,
so
it
should
seem
quite
natural
for
us
*NL*
to
be
there
.
The
trouble
is
evidently
nervous
--
would
n't
you
*NL*
say
so
,
Margaret
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
,
a
very
young
man
,
began
to
ask
questions
*NL*
about
Helen
.
Was
she
normal
?
Was
there
anything
congenital
*NL*
or
hereditary
?
Had
anything
occurred
that
was
likely
to
*NL*
alienate
her
from
her
family
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
''
answered
Margaret
,
wondering
what
would
have
*NL*
happened
if
she
had
added
:
``
Though
she
did
resent
my
*NL*
husband
's
immorality
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
always
was
highly
strung
,
''
pursued
Henry
,
leaning
*NL*
back
in
the
car
as
it
shot
past
the
church
.
``
A
tendency
to
*NL*
spiritualism
and
those
things
,
though
nothing
serious
.
*NL*
Musical
,
literary
,
artistic
,
but
I
should
say
normal
--
a
very
*NL*
charming
girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
's
anger
and
terror
increased
every
moment
.
How
*NL*
dare
these
men
label
her
sister
!
What
horrors
lay
ahead
!
*NL*
What
impertinences
that
shelter
under
the
name
of
science
!
*NL*
The
pack
was
turning
on
Helen
,
to
deny
her
human
rights
,
and
*NL*
it
seemed
to
Margaret
that
all
Schlegels
were
threatened
*NL*
with
her
.
``
Were
they
normal
?
''
What
a
question
to
ask
!
And
*NL*
it
is
always
those
who
know
nothing
about
human
nature
,
who
*NL*
are
bored
by
psychology
and
shocked
by
physiology
,
who
ask
*NL*
it
.
However
piteous
her
sister
's
state
,
she
knew
that
she
*NL*
must
be
on
her
side
.
They
would
be
mad
together
if
the
*NL*
world
chose
to
consider
them
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
now
five
minutes
past
three
.
The
car
slowed
down
*NL*
by
the
farm
,
in
the
yard
of
which
Miss
Avery
was
standing
.
*NL*
Henry
asked
her
whether
a
cab
had
gone
past
.
She
nodded
,
*NL*
and
the
next
moment
they
caught
sight
of
it
,
at
the
end
of
*NL*
the
lane
.
The
car
ran
silently
like
a
beast
of
prey
.
So
*NL*
unsuspicious
was
Helen
that
she
was
sitting
on
the
porch
,
*NL*
with
her
back
to
the
road
.
She
had
come
.
Only
her
head
and
*NL*
shoulders
were
visible
.
She
sat
framed
in
the
vine
,
and
one
*NL*
of
her
hands
played
with
the
buds
.
The
wind
ruffled
her
*NL*
hair
,
the
sun
glorified
it
;
she
was
as
she
had
always
been
.
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
was
seated
next
to
the
door
.
Before
her
*NL*
husband
could
prevent
her
,
she
slipped
out
.
She
ran
to
the
*NL*
garden
gate
,
which
was
shut
,
passed
through
it
,
and
*NL*
deliberately
pushed
it
in
his
face
.
The
noise
alarmed
*NL*
Helen
.
Margaret
saw
her
rise
with
an
unfamiliar
movement
,
*NL*
and
,
rushing
into
the
porch
,
learnt
the
simple
explanation
*NL*
of
all
their
fears
--
her
sister
was
with
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
the
truant
all
right
?
''
called
Henry
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
time
to
whisper
:
``
Oh
,
my
darling
--
''
The
keys
of
*NL*
the
house
were
in
her
hand
.
She
unlocked
Howards
End
and
*NL*
thrust
Helen
into
it
.
``
Yes
,
all
right
,
''
she
said
,
and
stood
*NL*
with
her
back
to
the
door
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Margaret
,
you
look
upset
!
''
said
Henry
.
Mansbridge
had
*NL*
followed
.
Crane
was
at
the
gate
,
and
the
flyman
had
stood
*NL*
up
on
the
box
.
Margaret
shook
her
head
at
them
;
she
could
*NL*
not
speak
any
more
.
She
remained
clutching
the
keys
,
as
if
*NL*
all
their
future
depended
on
them
.
Henry
was
asking
more
*NL*
questions
.
She
shook
her
head
again
.
His
words
had
no
*NL*
sense
.
She
heard
him
wonder
why
she
had
let
Helen
in
.
``
You
*NL*
might
have
given
me
a
knock
with
the
gate
,
''
was
another
of
*NL*
his
remarks
.
Presently
she
heard
herself
speaking
.
She
,
or
*NL*
someone
for
her
,
said
``
Go
away
.
''
Henry
came
nearer
.
He
*NL*
repeated
,
``
Margaret
,
you
look
upset
again
.
My
dear
,
give
me
*NL*
the
keys
.
What
are
you
doing
with
Helen
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dearest
,
do
go
away
,
and
I
will
manage
it
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Manage
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stretched
out
his
hand
for
the
keys
.
She
might
have
*NL*
obeyed
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
that
at
least
,
''
she
said
piteously
;
the
doctor
had
*NL*
turned
back
,
and
was
questioning
the
driver
of
Helen
's
cab
.
*NL*
A
new
feeling
came
over
her
;
she
was
fighting
for
women
*NL*
against
men
.
She
did
not
care
about
rights
,
but
if
men
came
*NL*
into
Howards
End
,
it
should
be
over
her
body
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
this
is
an
odd
beginning
,
''
said
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
came
forward
now
,
and
whispered
two
words
to
*NL*
Mr.
Wilcox
--
the
scandal
was
out
.
Sincerely
horrified
,
Henry
*NL*
stood
gazing
at
the
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
help
it
,
''
said
Margaret
.
``
Do
wait
.
It
's
not
*NL*
my
fault
.
Please
all
four
of
you
to
go
away
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Now
the
flyman
was
whispering
to
Crane
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
relying
on
you
to
help
us
,
Mrs.
Wilcox
,
''
said
*NL*
the
young
doctor
.
``
Could
you
go
in
and
persuade
your
sister
*NL*
to
come
out
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
what
grounds
?
''
said
Margaret
,
suddenly
looking
him
*NL*
straight
in
the
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thinking
it
professional
to
prevaricate
,
he
murmured
*NL*
something
about
a
nervous
breakdown
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
but
it
is
nothing
of
the
sort

You
*NL*
are
not
qualified
to
attend
my
sister
,
Mr.
Mansbridge
.
If
*NL*
we
require
your
services
,
we
will
let
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
diagnose
the
case
more
bluntly
if
you
wish
,

he
retorted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
could
,
but
you
have
not

You
are

therefore

not
*NL*
qualified

attend

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
come
,
Margaret
!
''
said
Henry
,
never
raising
his
*NL*
eyes
.
``
This
is
a
terrible
business

an
appalling
business

It

Forgive

Margaret
was
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
business
is
as
broad
as
it
's
long

contributed
*NL*
the
doctor
.
``
We
had
better
all
work
together

You
need
us

*NL*
Mrs.
Wilcox

we
need
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
so

''
said
Henry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
need
you
in
the
least

said
Margaret
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
men
looked
at
each
other
anxiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
more
does
my
sister
,
who
is
still
many
weeks
from
*NL*
her
confinement

*NL*
*NL*
``
Margaret

Margaret
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Henry
,
send
your
doctor
away
.
What
possible
use
*NL*
is
he
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Wilcox
ran
his
eye
over
the
house
.
He
had
a
vague
*NL*
feeling
that
he
must
stand
firm
and
support
the
doctor
.
He
*NL*
himself
might
need
support
,
for
there
was
trouble
ahead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
all
turns
on
affection
now
,
''
said
Margaret
.
*NL*
``
Affection

Do
n't
you
see
?
''
Resuming
her
usual
methods
,
*NL*
she
wrote
the
word
on
the
house
with
her
finger
.
``
Surely
*NL*
you
see
.
I
like
Helen
very
much
,
you
not
so
much

Mr.
*NL*
Mansbridge
does
n't
know
her
.
That
's
all
.
And
affection
,
*NL*
when
reciprocated
,
gives
rights
.
Put
that
down
in
your
*NL*
notebook
,
Mr.
Mansbridge
.
It
's
a
useful
formula
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henry
told
her
to
be
calm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
know
what
you
want
yourselves

said
*NL*
Margaret
,
folding
her
arms
.
``
For
one
sensible
remark
I
will
*NL*
let
you
in

But
you
can
not
make
it

You

trouble
my
*NL*
sister
for
no
reason

I
will
not
permit
it

I
'll
stand
*NL*
here
all
the
day
sooner

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Henry
in
a
low
voice
,
``
perhaps
not
now

*NL*
*NL*
The
pack
was
breaking
up
.
At
a
sign
from
his
master
,
*NL*
Crane
also
went
back
into
the
car
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Henry
,
you
,
''
she
said
gently
.
None
of
her
*NL*
bitterness
had
been
directed
at
him
.
``
Go
away
now
,
dear
.
I
*NL*
shall
want
your
advice
later

no

Forgive

*NL*
have
been
cross

But
,
seriously
,
you
must
go

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
too
stupid
to
leave
her
.
Now
it
was
Mr.
*NL*
Mansbridge
who
called
in
a
low
voice
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
soon
find
you
down
at
Dolly
's

''
she
called
,
as
*NL*
the
gate
at
last
clanged
between
them
.
The
fly
moved
out
of
*NL*
the
way
,
the
motor
backed
,
turned
a
little
,
backed
again
,
*NL*
and
turned
in
the
narrow
road
.
A
string
of
farm
carts
came
*NL*
up
in
the
middle
;
but
she
waited
through
all
,
for
there
was
*NL*
no
hurry
.
When
all
was
over
and
the
car
had
started
,
she
*NL*
opened
the
door
.
``
Oh
,
my
darling
!
''
she
said
.
``
My
darling

*NL*
forgive
me

Helen
was
standing
in
the
hall
.

Margaret
bolted
the
door
on
the
inside
.
Then
she
would
have
*NL*
kissed
her
sister
,
but
Helen
,
in
a
dignified
voice
,
that
*NL*
came
strangely
from
her
,
said
:

``

turning
away

crying
a

very
little

selected

*NL*
She
did
not
think
of
questioning
her
sister

nor
of
*NL*
rebuking
her

Both
might
be
necessary
in
the
future

*NL*
she
had
first
to
purge
a
greater
crime
than
any
that
Helen
*NL*
could
have
committed

that
want
of
confidence
that
is
the
*NL*
work
of
the
devil

``
Yes

I
am
annoyed

replied
Helen

*NL*

But
why
did
n't
you
tell
me

Yes

replied
Helen
judicially

Margaret

originally
on

*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
guessed
at
Monica

type

``
Italiano
Inglesiato

*NL*
they
had
named
it
:
the
crude
feminist
of
the
South
,
whom
one
*NL*
respects
but
avoids
.
And
Helen
had
turned
to
it
in
her
*NL*
need
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
not
think
that

*NL*
Helen
,
with
a
measured
kindness

``
I

Meg

very

is
a
shock

It

they

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

Meg
dear
,
why
do

She
dropped
a
*NL*
book
and
sighed
wearily
.
Then
,
recovering
herself
,
she
*NL*
said
:
``
Tell
me

is
it
that

down
here

with
a
frown

still
Helen

Now
this

has
n't
the
feel

The

seems
more
alive

She
stopped

*NL*
``
I

as
for
fitting

life

put
it
out
of
your

at
once

Imagine
a

me
at
*NL*
Ducie
Street

It
's
unthinkable

*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
could
not
contradict
her
.
It
was
appalling
to
*NL*
see
her
quietly
moving
forward
with
her
plans
,
not
bitter
or
*NL*
excitable
,
neither
asserting
innocence
nor
confessing
guilt
,
*NL*
merely
desiring
freedom
and
the
company
of
those
who
would
*NL*
not
blame
her
.
She
had
been
through
--
how
much
?
Margaret
*NL*
did
not
know
.
But
it
was
enough
to
part
her
from
old
habits
*NL*
as
well
as
old
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
about
yourself
,
''
said
Helen
,
who
had
chosen
her
*NL*
books
,
and
was
lingering
over
the
furniture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
nothing
to
tell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
your
marriage
has
been
happy

Meg
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I

It
is
a
nuisance
,
but
no
good
trying

''
*NL*
*NL*
Something
had
come
between
them
.
Perhaps
it
was
*NL*
Society
,
which
henceforward
would
exclude
Helen
.
Perhaps
it
*NL*
was
a
third
life
,
already
potent
as
a
spirit
.
They
could
*NL*
find
no
meeting-place
.
Both
suffered
acutely
,
and
were
not
*NL*
comforted
by
the
knowledge
that
affection
survived
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
,
Meg
,
is
the
coast
clear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
that
you
want
to
go
away
from
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose

old
lady

any

knew

have
nothing
to
say
.
Give
my
love
to
Aunt
Juley
*NL*
and
Tibby
,
and
take
more
yourself
than
I
can
say

Promise

to
come
and
see
me
in
Munich
later

*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
that
is
all
we
can
do

''
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
so
.
Most
ghastly
of
all
was
Helen
's
common
*NL*
sense
:
Monica
had
been
extraordinarily
good
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
to
have
seen
you
and
the
things
.
''
She
looked
*NL*
at
the
bookcase
lovingly
,
as
if
she
was
saying
farewell
to
*NL*
the
past
.
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
unbolted
the
door
.
She
remarked
:
``
The
car
has
*NL*
gone
,
and
here
's
your
cab
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
led
the
way
to
it
,
glancing
at
the
leaves
and
the
*NL*
sky
.
The
spring
had
never
seemed
more
beautiful
.
The
*NL*
driver
,
who
was
leaning
on
the
gate
,
called
out
,
``
Please
,
*NL*
lady
,
a
message
,
''
and
handed
her
Henry
's
visiting-card
*NL*
through
the
bars
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
did
this
come
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Crane
had
returned
with
it
almost
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
read
the
card
with
annoyance
.
It
was
covered
with
*NL*
instructions
in
domestic
French
.
When
she
and
her
sister
*NL*
had
talked
she
was
to
come
back
for
the
night
to
Dolly
's
.
*NL*
``
Il
faut
dormir
sur
ce
sujet
.
''
While
Helen
was
to
be
found
*NL*
``
une
comfortable
chambre
a
l'hotel
.
''
The
final
sentence
*NL*
displeased
her
greatly
until
she
remembered
that
the
*NL*
Charles
'
had
only
one
spare
room
,
and
so
could
not
invite
a
*NL*
third
guest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Henry
would
have
done
what
he
could
,
''
she
interpreted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Helen
had
not
followed
her
into
the
garden
.
The
door
*NL*
once
open
,
she
lost
her
inclination
to
fly
.
She
remained
in
*NL*
the
hall
,
going
from
bookcase
to
table
.
She
grew
more
like
*NL*
the
old
Helen
,
irresponsible
and
charming
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
Mr.
Wilcox
's
house
?
''
she
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
you
remember
Howards
End
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Remember

I
who
remember
everything

But
it
looks
to

be
ours
now

*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Avery
was
extraordinary
,
''
said
Margaret
,
her
own
*NL*
spirits
lightening
a
little
.
Again
she
was
invaded
by
a
*NL*
slight
feeling
of
disloyalty
.
But
it
brought
her
relief
,
*NL*
and
she
yielded
to
it
.
``
She
loved
Mrs.
Wilcox
,
and
would
*NL*
rather
furnish
her
house
with
our
things

empty

In
consequence
here
are
all
the
library
books

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

``

Helen

They
went
in

their

natural

moved

down

some

it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
that
greengage
tree
,
''
cried
Helen
,
as
if
the
garden
*NL*
was
also
part
of
their
childhood
.
``
Why
do
I
connect
it
with
*NL*
dumbbells
?
And
there
come
the
chickens
.
The
grass
wants
*NL*
cutting
.
I
love
yellow-hammers

''
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
interrupted
her
.
``
I
have
got
it
,
''
she
*NL*
announced
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Tea
,
tea
,
coffee
,
tea
,
<BR>
*NL*
Or
chocolaritee

'
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
every
morning
for
three
weeks
.
No
wonder
Tibby
*NL*
was
wild
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tibby
is
moderately
a
dear
now
,
''
said
Helen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
!
I
knew
you
'd
say
that
in
the
end
.
Of
course
*NL*
he
's
a
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
bell
rang
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
!
what
's
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Helen
said
,
``
Perhaps
the
Wilcoxes
are
beginning
the
siege
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
nonsense
--
listen
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
triviality
faded
from
their
faces
,
though
it
*NL*
left
something
behind
--
the
knowledge
that
they
never
could
*NL*
be
parted
because
their
love
was
rooted
in
common
things
.
*NL*
Explanations
and
appeals
had
failed
;
they
had
tried
for
a
*NL*
common
meeting-ground
,
and
had
only
made
each
other
*NL*
unhappy
.
And
all
the
time
their
salvation
was
lying
round
*NL*
them
--
the
past
sanctifying
the
present
;
the
present
,
with
*NL*
wild
heart-throb
,
declaring
that
there
would
after
all
be
a
*NL*
future
,
with
laughter
and
the
voices
of
children
.
Helen
,
*NL*
still
smiling
,
came
up
to
her
sister
.
She
said
,
``
It
is
*NL*
always
Meg
.
''
They
looked
into
each
other
's
eyes
.
The
inner
*NL*
life
had
paid
.
*NL*
*NL*
Solemnly
the
clapper
tolled
.
No
one
was
in
the
front
.
*NL*
Margaret
went
to
the
kitchen
,
and
struggled
between
*NL*
packing-cases
to
the
window
.
Their
visitor
was
only
a
*NL*
little
boy
with
a
tin
can
.
And
triviality
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Little
boy
,
what
do
you
want
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
,
I
am
the
milk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
Miss
Avery
send
you
?
''
said
Margaret
,
rather
sharply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
take
it
back
and
say
we
require
no
milk

''
While
*NL*
she
called
to
Helen
,
``
No
,
it
's
not
the
siege
,
but
possibly
*NL*
an
attempt
to
provision
us
against
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
like
milk
,
''
cried
Helen
.
``
Why
send
it
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
?
Oh
,
very
well
.
But
we
've
nothing
to
put
it
*NL*
in
,
and
he
wants
the
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
,
I
'm
to
call
in
the
morning
for
the
can
,
''
said
*NL*
the
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
house
will
be
locked
up
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
morning
would
I
bring
eggs
,
too
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
the
boy
whom
I
saw
playing
in
the
stacks
last
week
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
hung
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
run
away
and
do
it
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nice
little
boy
,
''
whispered
Helen
.
``
I
say
,
what
's
your
*NL*
name
?
Mine
's
Helen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
Helen
all
over
.
The
Wilcoxes
,
too
,
would
ask
a
*NL*
child
its
name
,
but
they
never
told
their
names
in
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom
,
this
one
here
is
Margaret
.
And
at
home
we
've
*NL*
another
called
Tibby
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mine
are
lop-eared
,
''
replied
Tom
,
supposing
Tibby
to
be
*NL*
a
rabbit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
a
very
good
and
rather
a
clever
little
boy

*NL*
Mind
you
come
again
.

Is
n't
he
charming
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Undoubtedly
,
''
said
Margaret
.
``
He
is
probably
the
son
of
*NL*
Madge
,
and
Madge
is
dreadful
.
But
this
place
has
wonderful
powers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
probably
agree
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
kills
what
is
dreadful
and
makes
what
is
beautiful
live
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
agree
,
''
said
Helen
,
as
she
sipped
the
milk
.
``
But
*NL*
you
said
that
the
house
was
dead
not
half
an
hour
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Meaning
that
I
was
dead
.
I
felt
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
the
house
has
a
surer
life
than
we

even
if
it

empty

as
it
is
,
I
ca
n't
get
over
that
for
thirty
years
*NL*
the
sun
has
never
shone
full
on
our
furniture
.
After
all
,
*NL*
Wickham
Place
was
a
grave
.
Meg
,
I
've
a
startling
idea
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Drink
some
milk
to
steady
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
obeyed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
wo
n't
tell
you
yet
,
''
said
Helen
,
``
because
you
may
*NL*
laugh
or
be
angry
.
Let
's
go
upstairs
first
and
give
the
*NL*
rooms
an
airing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
opened
window
after
window
,
till
the
inside
,
too
,
*NL*
was
rustling
to
the
spring
.
Curtains
blew
,
picture-frames
*NL*
tapped
cheerfully
.
Helen
uttered
cries
of
excitement
as
she
*NL*
found
this
bed
obviously
in
its
right
place
,
that
in
its
*NL*
wrong
one
.
She
was
angry
with
Miss
Avery
for
not
having
*NL*
moved
the
wardrobes
up
.
``
Then
one
would
see
really
.
''
She
*NL*
admired
the
view
.
She
was
the
Helen
who
had
written
the
*NL*
memorable
letters
four
years
ago
.
As
they
leant
out
,
*NL*
looking
westward
,
she
said
:
``
About
my
idea
.
Could
n't
you
*NL*
and
I
camp
out
in
this
house
for
the
night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
we
could
well
do
that
,
''
said
Margaret
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
are
beds
,
tables

towels

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
;
but
the
house
is
n't
supposed
to
be
slept
in

Henry

--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
require
no
suggestions

I
shall
not
alter
anything

in
my
plans

But
it
would
give
me
so
much
pleasure
to
have
*NL*
one
night
here
with
you
.
It
will
be
something
to
look
back
*NL*
on

Oh

Meg
lovey
,
do
let

!

*NL*
*NL*
``
But

Helen
,
my
pet

said
Margaret
,
``
we
ca
n't
without
*NL*
getting
Henry
's
leave

Of
course
,
he
would
give
it
,
but
you
*NL*
said
yourself
that
you
could
n't
visit
at
Ducie
Street
now
,
*NL*
and
this
is
equally
intimate
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ducie

is
his

camp
out

just
one
night

feed

Why

It

*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
hesitated
.
``
I
feel
Charles
would
n't
like
it
,
''
*NL*
she
said
at
last
.
``
Even
our
furniture
annoyed
him

I
*NL*
was
going
to
clear
it
out
when
Aunt
Juley

illness
*NL*
prevented
me

I
sympathize
with
Charles

He
feels
it
's
his
*NL*
mother
's
house

He
loves
it
in
rather
an
untaking
way

could
answer
for

not
Charles

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

said
Helen
.
``
But
I
am
going

to
pass
out

What
difference
will
it
make
in

the
long
run
if
they
say
,

And
she
even
spent
the
night
at
*NL*
Howards
End

?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
know
you
'll
pass
out

have
thought
that
twice
before

*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
my
plans

''
*NL*
*NL*
''

which
you
change
in
a
moment

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
because
my
life
is
great
and
theirs
are
little

*NL*
said
Helen
,
taking
fire
.
``
I
know
of
things
they
ca
n't
know
*NL*
of
,
and
so
do
you
.
We
know
that
there
's
poetry

We
know
*NL*
that
there
's
death

They
can
only
take
them
on
hearsay
.
We
*NL*
know
this
is
our
house
,
because
it
feels
ours
.
Oh
,
they
may
*NL*
take
the
title-deeds
and
the
doorkeys
,
but
for
this
one
*NL*
night
we
are
at
home

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
lovely
to
have
you
once
more
alone

said
*NL*
Margaret
.
``
It
may
be
a
chance
in
a
thousand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
we
could
talk
.
''
She
dropped
her
voice
.
``
It
*NL*
wo
n't
be
a
very
glorious
story
.
But
under
that
*NL*
wych-elm
--
honestly
,
I
see
little
happiness
ahead
.
Can
not
I
*NL*
have
this
one
night
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
need
n't
say
how
much
it
would
mean
to
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
let
us
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
It

no
good

Shall
I
drive
down
to
Hilton
*NL*
now
and
get
leave

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
we
do
n't
want
leave

''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Margaret
was
a
loyal
wife
.
In
spite
of
imagination
*NL*
and
poetry
--
perhaps
on
account
of
them
--
she
could
sympathize
*NL*
with
the
technical
attitude
that
Henry
would
adopt
.
If
*NL*
possible
,
she
would
be
technical
,
too
.
A
night
's
*NL*
lodging
--
and
they
demanded
no
more
--
need
not
involve
the
*NL*
discussion
of
general
principles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Charles
may
say
no
,
''
grumbled
Helen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
sha
n't
consult
him

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
if
you
like
;
I
should
have
stopped
without
leave
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
touch
of
selfishness
,
which
was
not
enough
to
*NL*
mar
Helen
's
character
,
and
even
added
to
its
beauty
.
She
*NL*
would
have
stopped
without
leave
,
and
escaped
to
Germany
the
*NL*
next
morning
.
Margaret
kissed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Expect
me
back
before
dark
.
I
am
looking
forward
to
it
*NL*
so
much

It
is
like
you
to
have
thought
of
such
a
beautiful
*NL*
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
thing
,
only
an
ending
,
''
said
Helen
rather
sadly
;
*NL*
and
the
sense
of
tragedy
closed
in
on
Margaret
again
as
soon
*NL*
as
she
left
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
afraid
of
Miss
Avery
.
It
is
disquieting
to
*NL*
fulfil
a
prophecy
,
however
superficially
.
She
was
glad
to
*NL*
see
no
watching
figure
as
she
drove
past
the
farm
,
but
only
*NL*
little
Tom
,
turning
somersaults
in
the
straw
.

*NL*
The
tragedy
began
quietly
enough
,
and
like
many
another
*NL*
talk
,
by
the
man
's
deft
assertion
of
his
superiority
.
Henry
*NL*
heard
her
arguing
with
the
driver
,
stepped
out
and
settled
*NL*
the
fellow
,
who
was
inclined
to
be
rude
,
and
then
led
the
*NL*
way
to
some
chairs
on
the
lawn
.
Dolly
,
who
had
not
been
*NL*
``
told
,
''
ran
out
with
offers
of
tea
.
He
refused
them
,
and
*NL*
ordered
her
to
wheel
baby
's
perambulator
away
,
as
they
*NL*
desired
to
be
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
diddums
ca
n't
listen
;
he
is
n't
nine
months
*NL*
old

''
she
pleaded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
not
what
I
was
saying
,
''
retorted
her
father-in-law
.
*NL*
*NL*
Baby
was
wheeled
out
of
earshot
,
and
did
not
hear
about
*NL*
the
crisis
till
later
years
.
It
was
now
the
turn
of
Margaret
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
what
we
feared
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
girl
,
''
he
began
,
``
there
is
a
troublesome
business
*NL*
ahead
of
us
,
and
nothing
but
the
most
absolute
honesty
and
*NL*
plain
speech
will
see
us
through
.

Margaret
bent
her
head
.
*NL*
``
I
am
obliged
to
question
you
on
subjects
we
'd
both
prefer
*NL*
to
leave
untouched

As
you
know
,
I
am
not
one
of
your
*NL*
Bernard
Shaws
who
consider
nothing
sacred

To
speak
as
I
*NL*
must
will
pain
me

there
are
occasions

We
are
husband
*NL*
and
wife

not
children

I
am

you

''
*NL*
*NL*
All
Margaret
's
senses
forsook
her
.
She
blushed
,
and
*NL*
looked
past
him
at
the
Six
Hills
,
covered
with
spring
*NL*
herbage
.
Noting
her
colour
,
he
grew
still
more
kind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
that
you
feel
as
I
felt
when

My
poor
little

wife

be
brave

Just
one
or
two
questions

I
have

done
with
you

Was
your
sister
wearing
a
wedding-ring
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
stammered
a
``
No

*NL*
*NL*
There
was
an
appalling
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

seducer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
rose
to
her
feet
and
held
the
chair
between
them
.
*NL*
Her
colour
had
ebbed
,
and
she
was
grey
.
It
did
not
*NL*
displease
him
that
she
should
receive
his
question
thus
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
your
time
,
''
he
counselled
her
.
``
Remember
that
*NL*
this
is
far
worse
for
me
than
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
swayed
;
he
feared
she
was
going
to
faint
.
Then
*NL*
speech
came
,
and
she
said
slowly
:
``
Seducer
?
No
;
I
do
not
*NL*
know
her
seducer
's
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
she
not
tell
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
even
asked
her
who
seduced
her
,
''
said
Margaret
,
*NL*
dwelling
on
the
hateful
word
thoughtfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
singular
.
''
Then
he
changed
his
mind
.
``
Natural
*NL*
perhaps
,
dear
girl
,
that
you
should
n't
ask
.
But
until
his
*NL*
name
is
known
,
nothing
can
be
done
.
Sit
down
.
How
terrible
*NL*
it
is
to
see
you
so
upset
!
I
knew
you
were
n't
fit
for
it
.
*NL*
I
wish
I
had
n't
taken
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
answered
,
``
I
like
to
stand
,
if
you
do
n't
mind
,
*NL*
for
it
gives
me
a
pleasant
view
of
the
Six
Hills
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
anything
else
to
ask
me
,
Henry
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Next
you
must
tell
me
whether
you
have
gathered
*NL*
anything
.
I
have
often
noticed
your
insight
,
dear
.
I
only
*NL*
wish
my
own
was
as
good
.
You
may
have
guessed
something
,
*NL*
even
though
your
sister
said
nothing
.
The
slightest
hint
*NL*
would
help
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
`
we
'
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
it
best
to
ring
up
Charles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
unnecessary
,
''
said
Margaret
,
growing
warmer
.
*NL*
``
This
news
will
give
Charles
disproportionate
pain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
at
once
gone
to
call
on
your
brother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
too
was
unnecessary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
explain
,
dear
,
how
the
matter
stands
.
You
do
n't
*NL*
think
that
I
and
my
son
are
other
than
gentlemen
?
It
is
in
*NL*
Helen
's
interests
that
we
are
acting
.
It
is
still
not
too
*NL*
late
to
save
her
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Margaret
hit
out
for
the
first
time
.
``
Are
we
to
*NL*
make
her
seducer
marry
her
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
possible
.
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Henry
,
suppose
he
turned
out
to
be
married
*NL*
already
?
One
has
heard
of
such
cases
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
that
case
he
must
pay
heavily
for
his
misconduct
,
*NL*
and
be
thrashed
within
an
inch
of
his
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
her
first
blow
missed
.
She
was
thankful
of
it
.
What
*NL*
had
tempted
her
to
imperil
both
of
their
lives
?
Henry
's
*NL*
obtuseness
had
saved
her
as
well
as
himself
.
Exhausted
with
*NL*
anger
,
she
sat
down
again
,
blinking
at
him
as
he
told
her
as
*NL*
much
as
he
thought
fit
.
At
last
she
said
:
``
May
I
ask
you
my
*NL*
question
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
my
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tomorrow
Helen
goes
to
Munich
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
possibly
she
is
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Henry
,
let
a
lady
finish
.
Tomorrow
she
goes
;
tonight
,
*NL*
with
your
permission
,
she
would
like
to
sleep
at
Howards
End
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
crisis
of
his
life
.
Again
she
would
have
*NL*
recalled
the
words
as
soon
as
they
were
uttered
.
She
had
*NL*
not
led
up
to
them
with
sufficient
care
.
She
longed
to
warn
*NL*
him
that
they
were
far
more
important
than
he
supposed
.
She
*NL*
saw
him
weighing
them
,
as
if
they
were
a
business
proposition
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
Howards
End
?
''
he
said
at
last
.
``
Would
she
not
be
*NL*
more
comfortable
,
as
I
suggested
,
at
the
hotel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
hastened
to
give
him
reasons
.
``
It
is
an
odd
*NL*
request
,
but
you
know
what
Helen
is
and
what
women
in
her
*NL*
state
are
.
''
He
frowned
,
and
moved
irritably
.
``
She
has
the
*NL*
idea
that
one
night
in
your
house
would
give
her
pleasure
*NL*
and
do
her
good
.
I
think
she
's
right
.
Being
one
of
those
*NL*
imaginative
girls
,
the
presence
of
all
our
books
and
*NL*
furniture
soothes
her
.
This
is
a
fact
.
It
is
the
end
of
*NL*
her
girlhood
.
Her
last
words
to
me
were
,
'
A
beautiful
ending
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
values
the
old
furniture
for
sentimental
reasons
,
*NL*
in
fact
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
.
You
have
quite
understood
.
It
is
her
last
*NL*
hope
of
being
with
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
agree
there
,
my
dear
!
Helen
will
have
her
*NL*
share
of
the
goods
wherever
she
goes
--
possibly
more
than
her
*NL*
share
,
for
you
are
so
fond
of
her
that
you
'd
give
her
*NL*
anything
of
yours
that
she
fancies
,
would
n't
you
?
and
I
'd
*NL*
raise
no
objection
.
I
could
understand
it
if
it
was
her
old
*NL*
home
,
because
a
home
,
or
a
house
''
--
he
changed
the
word
,
*NL*
designedly
;
he
had
thought
of
a
telling
point
--
``
because
a
*NL*
house
in
which
one
has
once
lived
becomes
in
a
sort
of
way
*NL*
sacred
,
I
do
n't
know
why
.
Associations
and
so
on
.
Now
*NL*
Helen
has
no
associations
with
Howards
End
,
though
I
and
*NL*
Charles
and
Evie
have
.
I
do
not
see
why
she
wants
to
stay
*NL*
the
night
there
.
She
will
only
catch
cold
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
it
that
you
do
n't
see
,
''
cried
Margaret
.
``
Call
it
*NL*
fancy
.
But
realize
that
fancy
is
a
scientific
fact
.
Helen
*NL*
is
fanciful
,
and
wants
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
surprised
her
--
a
rare
occurrence
.
He
shot
an
*NL*
unexpected
bolt
.
``
If
she
wants
to
sleep
one
night
,
she
may
*NL*
want
to
sleep
two

We
shall
never
get
her
out
of
the
house
,
*NL*
perhaps
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
said
Margaret
,
with
the
precipice
in
sight
.
*NL*
``
And
suppose
we
do
n't
get
her
out
of

house

Would
it

matter

She

do
no
one
any
harm

*NL*
*NL*
Again
the
irritated
gesture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

Henry
,
''
she
panted
,
receding
.
``
I
did
n't
mean
*NL*
that

only
trouble
Howards
End

one
night

I
take
her
to
London
tomorrow

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
intend
to
sleep
in
a
damp
house

too
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
She
can
not
be
left
alone

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
quite
impossible

Madness

You
must
be
here
to

meet
Charles

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
already
told
you
that

unnecessary

I
have
no

*NL*
``
Margaret

this
business

*NL*
*NL*
``
As
the

Mr.
Wilcox
,

arching
his
fingers

In

depreciate

*NL*
``
My

you
are
forgetting

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
yourself
recommended
plain
speaking

*NL*
*NL*
They
looked
at
each
other
in
amazement
.
The
precipice
*NL*
was
at
their
feet
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Helen
commands
my
sympathy

said
Henry
.

As
your

husband

I
shall
do
all

no

doubt
that

prove
more
sinned
against

sinning

But
I
can
not
treat
her
as

nothing

I
should

be
false

*NL*
*NL*
She
controlled
herself
for
the
last
time
.
``
No
,
let
us
*NL*
go
back
to
Helen
's
request
,
''
she
said
.
``
It
is
unreasonable

*NL*
but
the
request

unhappy
girl

Tomorrow
she
will
go
to

Germany
,
and
trouble
society
no
longer

Tonight
she
asks
to

sleep
in
your
empty
house

a
house
which
you
do
not
care

about

which
you

not
occupied

over
a
year

she

Perhaps
some
hint
of
her

did
dawn
on
him

If
*NL*
so
,
he
blotted
it
out

Straight
from
his
fortress
he
*NL*
answered
:
``
I

unaccommodating

some

experience

another

I
am
afraid

said
Henry

rose
from
his
seat
with
face
unmoved
.
Margaret
rushed
at
*NL*
him
and
seized
both
his
hands
.
She
was
transfigured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
any

she
cried

her

Do
you
see
the
connection

Stupid

hypocritical

cruel

oh

contemptible
!

a
man
who
insults
*NL*
his
wife
when
she
's
alive

cants
with
her
memory
when
*NL*
she
's
dead

A
man

ruins
a

for
his
pleasure

casts
her
off
to
ruin
other
men

And
gives
bad
financial

advice

then
says

not
responsible

spoiled

``
The

Henry
stammered

His

real

was
not

His
brain
was
still
in
a

whirl

he
wanted

different

*NL*
Oh

the
uselessness
of
it

Henry
's
retort
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
perceive
you

attempting
blackmail

It
is
*NL*
scarcely
a
pretty
weapon

My
rule
through

has
been
never
to
pay
the
*NL*
least
attention
to
threats
,
and
I
can
only
repeat
what
I
*NL*
said
before
:
I
do
not
give
you
and
your
sister
leave
to
*NL*
sleep
at
Howards
End

''
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
loosed
his
hands
.
He
went
into
the
house
,
*NL*
wiping
first
one
and
then
the
other
on
his
handkerchief
.
*NL*
For
a
little
she
stood
looking
at
the
Six
Hills
,
tombs
of
*NL*
warriors
,
breasts
of
the
spring
.
Then
she
passed
out
into
*NL*
what
was
now
the
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
39
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
and
Tibby
met
at
Ducie
Street
,
where
the
latter
was
*NL*
staying
.
Their
interview
was
short
and
absurd
.
They
had
*NL*
nothing
in
common
but
the
English
language
,
and
tried
by
its
*NL*
help
to
express
what
neither
of
them
understood
.
Charles
*NL*
saw
in
Helen
the
family
foe
.
He
had
singled
her
out
as
the
*NL*
most
dangerous
of
the
Schlegels
,
and
,
angry
as
he
was
,
*NL*
looked
forward
to
telling
his
wife
how
right
he
had
been
.
*NL*
His
mind
was
made
up
at
once
:
the
girl
must
be
got
out
of
*NL*
the
way
before
she
disgraced
them
farther
.
If
occasion
*NL*
offered
she
might
be
married
to
a
villain
or
,
possibly
,
to
a
*NL*
fool
.
But
this
was
a
concession
to
morality
,
it
formed
no
*NL*
part
of
his
main
scheme
.
Honest
and
hearty
was
Charles
's
*NL*
dislike
,
and
the
past
spread
itself
out
very
clearly
before
*NL*
him
;
hatred
is
a
skilful
compositor
.
As
if
they
were
heads
*NL*
in
a
note-book
,
he
ran
through
all
the
incidents
of
the
*NL*
Schlegels
'
campaign
:
the
attempt
to
compromise
his
brother
,
*NL*
his
mother
's
legacy
,
his
father
's
marriage
,
the
introduction
*NL*
of
the
furniture
,
the
unpacking
of
the
same
.
He
had
not
yet
*NL*
heard
of
the
request
to
sleep
at
Howards
End
;
that
was
to
be
*NL*
their
master-stroke
and
the
opportunity
for
his
.
But
he
*NL*
already
felt
that
Howards
End
was
the
objective
,
and
,
though
*NL*
he
disliked
the
house
,
was
determined
to
defend
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tibby
,
on
the
other
hand
,
had
no
opinions
.
He
stood
*NL*
above
the
conventions
:
his
sister
had
a
right
to
do
what
she
*NL*
thought
right
.
It
is
not
difficult
to
stand
above
the
*NL*
conventions
when
we
leave
no
hostages
among
them
;
men
can
*NL*
always
be
more
unconventional
than
women
,
and
a
bachelor
of
*NL*
independent
means
need
encounter
no
difficulties
at
all
.
*NL*
Unlike
Charles
,
Tibby
had
money
enough
;
his
ancestors
had
*NL*
earned
it
for
him
,
and
if
he
shocked
the
people
in
one
set
*NL*
of
lodgings
he
had
only
to
move
into
another
.
His
was
the
*NL*
leisure
without
sympathy
--
an
attitude
as
fatal
as
the
*NL*
strenuous
:
a
little
cold
culture
may
be
raised
on
it
,
but
no
*NL*
art
.
His
sisters
had
seen
the
family
danger
,
and
had
never
*NL*
forgotten
to
discount
the
gold
islets
that
raised
them
from
*NL*
the
sea
.
Tibby
gave
all
the
praise
to
himself
,
and
so
*NL*
despised
the
struggling
and
the
submerged
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hence
the
absurdity
of
the
interview
;
the
gulf
between
*NL*
them
was
economic
as
well
as
spiritual
.
But
several
facts
*NL*
passed
:
Charles
pressed
for
them
with
an
impertinence
that
*NL*
the
undergraduate
could
not
withstand
.
On
what
date
had
*NL*
Helen
gone
abroad
?
To
whom
?
-LRB-
Charles
was
anxious
to
fasten
*NL*
the
scandal
on
Germany
.
-RRB-
Then
,
changing
his
tactics
,
he
said
*NL*
roughly
:
``
I
suppose
you
realize
that
you
are
your
sister
's
*NL*
protector
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
what
sense
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
a
man
played
about
with
my
sister
,
I
'd
send
a
bullet
*NL*
through
him
,
but
perhaps
you
do
n't
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mind
very
much
,
''
protested
Tibby
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
d'ye
suspect
,
then
?
Speak
out
,
man
.
One
always
*NL*
suspects
someone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
one
.
I
do
n't
think
so
.
''
Involuntarily
he
blushed
.
*NL*
He
had
remembered
the
scene
in
his
Oxford
rooms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
hiding
something
,
''
said
Charles
.
As
interviews
*NL*
go
,
he
got
the
best
of
this
one
.
``
When
you
saw
her
last
,
*NL*
did
she
mention
anyone
's
name
?
Yes
,
or
no
!
''
he
thundered
,
*NL*
so
that
Tibby
started
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
my
rooms
she
mentioned
some
friends
,
called
the
Basts
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
are
the
Basts
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
People
--
friends
of
hers
at
Evie
's
wedding
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
remember
.
But
,
by
great
Scott
!
I
do
.
My
aunt
*NL*
told
me
about
some
tag-rag
.
Was
she
full
of
them
when
you
*NL*
saw
her
?
Is
there
a
man
?
Did
she
speak
of
the
man
?
*NL*
Or
--
look
here
--
have
you
had
any
dealings
with
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tibby
was
silent
.
Without
intending
it
,
he
had
betrayed
*NL*
his
sister
's
confidence
;
he
was
not
enough
interested
in
*NL*
human
life
to
see
where
things
will
lead
to
.
He
had
a
*NL*
strong
regard
for
honesty
,
and
his
word
,
once
given
,
had
*NL*
always
been
kept
up
to
now
.
He
was
deeply
vexed
,
not
only
*NL*
for
the
harm
he
had
done
Helen
,
but
for
the
flaw
he
had
*NL*
discovered
in
his
own
equipment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
--
you
are
in
his
confidence
.
They
met
at
your
*NL*
rooms
.
Oh
,
what
a
family
,
what
a
family
!
God
help
the
poor
*NL*
pater
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Tibby
found
himself
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
40
*NL*
*NL*
Leonard
--
he
would
figure
at
length
in
a
newspaper
report
,
*NL*
but
that
evening
he
did
not
count
for
much
.
The
foot
of
the
*NL*
tree
was
in
shadow
,
since
the
moon
was
still
hidden
behind
*NL*
the
house
.
But
above
,
to
right
,
to
left
,
down
the
long
*NL*
meadow
the
moonlight
was
streaming
.
Leonard
seemed
not
a
*NL*
man
,
but
a
cause
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
it
was
Helen
's
way
of
falling
in
love
--
a
curious
*NL*
way
to
Margaret
,
whose
agony
and
whose
contempt
of
Henry
*NL*
were
yet
imprinted
with
his
image
.
Helen
forgot
people
.
*NL*
They
were
husks
that
had
enclosed
her
emotion
.
She
could
*NL*
pity
,
or
sacrifice
herself
,
or
have
instincts
,
but
had
she
*NL*
ever
loved
in
the
noblest
way
,
where
man
and
woman
,
having
*NL*
lost
themselves
in
sex
,
desire
to
lose
sex
itself
in
*NL*
comradeship
?
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
wondered
,
but
said
no
word
of
blame
.
This
was
*NL*
Helen
's
evening
.
Troubles
enough
lay
ahead
of
her
--
the
loss
*NL*
of
friends
and
of
social
advantages
,
the
agony
,
the
supreme
*NL*
agony
,
of
motherhood
,
which
is
even
yet
not
a
matter
of
*NL*
common
knowledge
.
For
the
present
let
the
moon
shine
*NL*
brightly
and
the
breezes
of
the
spring
blow
gently
,
dying
*NL*
away
from
the
gale
of
the
day
,
and
let
the
earth
,
who
brings
*NL*
increase
,
bring
peace
.
Not
even
to
herself
dare
she
blame
*NL*
Helen
.
She
could
not
assess
her
trespass
by
any
moral
code
;
*NL*
it
was
everything
or
nothing
.
Morality
can
tell
us
that
*NL*
murder
is
worse
than
stealing
,
and
group
most
sins
in
an
*NL*
order
all
must
approve
,
but
it
can
not
group
Helen
.
The
*NL*
surer
its
pronouncements
on
this
point
,
the
surer
may
we
be
*NL*
that
morality
is
not
speaking
.
Christ
was
evasive
when
they
*NL*
questioned
Him
.
It
is
those
that
can
not
connect
who
hasten
*NL*
to
cast
the
first
stone
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
Helen
's
evening
--
won
at
what
cost
,
and
not
to
*NL*
be
marred
by
the
sorrows
of
others
.
Of
her
own
tragedy
*NL*
Margaret
never
uttered
a
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
isolates
,
''
said
Helen
slowly
.
``
I
isolated
Mr.
*NL*
Wilcox
from
the
other
forces
that
were
pulling
Leonard
*NL*
downhill
.
Consequently
,
I
was
full
of
pity
,
and
almost
of
*NL*
revenge
.
For
weeks
I
had
blamed
Mr.
Wilcox
only
,
and
so
,
*NL*
when
your
letters
came
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
need
never
have
written
them
,
''
sighed
Margaret
.
*NL*
``
They
never
shielded
Henry
.
How
hopeless
it
is
to
tidy
away
*NL*
the
past
,
even
for
others
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
know
that
it
was
your
own
idea
to
dismiss
the
*NL*
Basts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Looking
back
,
that
was
wrong
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Looking
back
,
darling
,
I
know
that
it
was
right
.
It
is
*NL*
right
to
save
the
man
whom
one
loves
.
I
am
less
*NL*
enthusiastic
about
justice
now
.
But
we
both
thought
you
*NL*
wrote
at
his
dictation
.
It
seemed
the
last
touch
of
his
*NL*
callousness
.
Being
very
much
wrought
up
by
this
time
--
and
*NL*
Mrs.
Bast
was
upstairs
.
I
had
not
seen
her
,
and
had
talked
*NL*
for
a
long
time
to
Leonard
--
I
had
snubbed
him
for
no
reason
,
*NL*
and
that
should
have
warned
me
I
was
in
danger
.
So
when
the
*NL*
notes
came
I
wanted
us
to
go
to
you
for
an
explanation
.
He
*NL*
said
that
he
guessed
the
explanation
--
he
knew
of
it
,
and
you
*NL*
must
n't
know
.
I
pressed
him
to
tell
me
.
He
said
no
one
*NL*
must
know
;
it
was
something
to
do
with
his
wife
.
Right
up
*NL*
to
the
end
we
were
Mr.
Bast
and
Miss
Schlegel
.
I
was
going
*NL*
to
tell
him
that
he
must
be
frank
with
me
when
I
saw
his
*NL*
eyes
,
and
guessed
that
Mr.
Wilcox
had
ruined
him
in
two
*NL*
ways
,
not
one
.
I
drew
him
to
me
.
I
made
him
tell
me
.
I
*NL*
felt
very
lonely
myself
.
He
is
not
to
blame
.
He
would
have
*NL*
gone
on
worshipping
me
.
I
want
never
to
see
him
again
,
*NL*
though
it
sounds
appalling
.
I
wanted
to
give
him
money
and
*NL*
feel
finished
.
Oh
,
Meg
,
the
little
that
is
known
about
*NL*
these
things
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
laid
her
face
against
the
tree
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
little
,
too
,
that
is
known
about
growth
!
Both
*NL*
times
it
was
loneliness
,
and
the
night
,
and
panic
*NL*
afterwards
.
Did
Leonard
grow
out
of
Paul
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
did
not
speak
for
a
moment
.
So
tired
was
she
*NL*
that
her
attention
had
actually
wandered
to
the
teeth
--
the
*NL*
teeth
that
had
been
thrust
into
the
tree
's
bark
to
medicate
*NL*
it
.
From
where
she
sat
she
could
see
them
gleam
.
She
had
*NL*
been
trying
to
count
them
.
``
Leonard
is
a
better
growth
than
*NL*
madness
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
was
afraid
that
you
would
react

against
Paul

went
over
the
verge

*NL*
``
I

kindly
about

all
that
blinding
hate
is
over

I
shall
never
rave
against
Wilcoxes
any
more

I
understand

how
you
married
him
,
and
you
will
now
be
very
happy

*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
did
not
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

''
repeated
Helen
,
her
voice
growing
more
tender
,
``
I

do
at
last
understand

*NL*
``
Except

Not
quite

I
feel
that
you

only

fragments

She
knows
everything

She
*NL*
is
everything

She
is
the
house

and
the
tree
that
leans
*NL*
over
it

their

lives

and
even
if
there
is
nothing
beyond
death

we

nothingness

I
can
not

that
knowledge

such
as
hers
will
perish
with
knowledge
such
as
mine

She

knew
about
realities

She
knew
when
people
were
in
love

though
she
was
not
in

I
do
n't
doubt

deceived
her

*NL*
``
Good-night

Mrs.

called
a
voice

*NL*
``
Oh

``
Why

*NL*
``
Why

*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Avery
crossed
the
lawn
and
merged
into
the
hedge
*NL*
that
divided
it
from
the
farm
.
An
old
gap
,
which
Mr.
Wilcox
*NL*
had
filled
up
,
had
reappeared
,
and
her
track
through
the
dew
*NL*
followed
the
path
that
he
had
turfed
over
,
when
he
improved
*NL*
the
garden
and
made
it
possible
for
games

*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
not
quite
our

said
Helen

``
When

*NL*
Margaret
thought
for
a
moment

In
the
past
year
she
had
*NL*
grown
so
fond
of
England
that
to
leave
it
was
a
real
grief
.
*NL*
Yet
what
detained
her
?
No
doubt
Henry
would
pardon
her
*NL*
outburst
,
and
go
on
blustering
and
muddling
into
a
ripe
old
*NL*
age
.
But
what
was
the
good
?
She
had
just
as
soon
vanish
*NL*
from
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
serious

``
Still

no

And
no
more
reminiscences

''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
silent
for
a
little
.
It
was
Helen
's
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
present
flowed
by
them
like
a
stream
.
The
tree
*NL*
rustled
.
It
had
made
music
before
they
were
born
,
and
would
*NL*
continue
after
their
deaths
,
but
its
song
was
of
the
*NL*
moment
.
The
moment
had
passed
.
The
tree
rustled
again
.
*NL*
Their
senses
were
sharpened
,
and
they
seemed
to
apprehend
*NL*
life

Life
passed

The

nestled
again

Sleep
now
,
''
said
Margaret
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
peace
of
the
country
was
entering
into
her
.
It
has
*NL*
no
commerce
with
memory
,
and
little
with
hope
.
Least
of
all
*NL*
is
it
concerned
with
the
hopes
of
the
next
five
minutes
.
It
*NL*
is
the
peace
of
the
present
,
which
passes
understanding
.
*NL*
Its
murmur
came
``
now
,
''
and
``
now
''
once
more
as
they
trod
the
*NL*
gravel
,
and
``
now
,
''
as
the
moonlight
fell
upon
their
father
's
*NL*
sword
.
They
passed
upstairs
,
kissed
,
and
amidst
the
endless
*NL*
iterations
fell
asleep
.
The
house
had
enshadowed
the
tree
*NL*
at
first
,
but
as
the
moon
rose
higher
the
two
disentangled
,
*NL*
and
were
clear
for
a
few
moments
at
midnight
.
Margaret
*NL*
awoke
and
looked
into
the
garden
.
How
incomprehensible
that
*NL*
Leonard
Bast
should
have
won
her
this
night
of
peace
!
Was
*NL*
he
also
part
of
Mrs.
Wilcox
's
mind
?
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
41
*NL*
*NL*
Far
different
was
Leonard
's
development
.
The
months
after
*NL*
Oniton
,
whatever
minor
troubles
they
might
bring
him
,
were
*NL*
all
overshadowed
by
Remorse
.
When
Helen
looked
back
she
*NL*
could
philosophize
,
or
she
could
look
into
the
future
and
*NL*
plan
for
her
child
.
But
the
father
saw
nothing
beyond
his
*NL*
own
sin
.
Weeks
afterwards
,
in
the
midst
of
other
*NL*
occupations
,
he
would
suddenly
cry
out
,
``
Brute
--
you
brute
,
I
*NL*
could
n't
have
--
''
and
be
rent
into
two
people
who
held
*NL*
dialogues
.
Or
brown
rain
would
descend
,
blotting
out
faces
*NL*
and
the
sky
.
Even
Jacky
noticed
the
change
in
him
.
Most
*NL*
terrible
were
his
sufferings
when
he
awoke
from
sleep
.
*NL*
Sometimes
he
was
happy
at
first
,
but
grew
conscious
of
a
*NL*
burden
hanging
to
him
and
weighing
down
his
thoughts
when
*NL*
they
would
move
.
Or
little
irons
scorched
his
body
.
Or
a
*NL*
sword
stabbed
him
.
He
would
sit
at
the
edge
of
his
bed
,
*NL*
holding
his
heart
and
moaning
,
``
Oh
what
SHALL
I
do
,
whatever
*NL*
SHALL
I
do
?
''
Nothing
brought
ease
.
He
could
put
distance
*NL*
between
him
and
the
trespass
,
but
it
grew
in
his
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
Remorse
is
not
among
the
eternal
verities
.
The
Greeks
*NL*
were
right
to
dethrone
her
.
Her
action
is
too
capricious
,
*NL*
as
though
the
Erinyes
selected
for
punishment
only
certain
*NL*
men
and
certain
sins
.
And
of
all
means
to
regeneration
*NL*
Remorse
is
surely
the
most
wasteful
.
It
cuts
away
healthy
*NL*
tissues
with
the
poisoned
.
It
is
a
knife
that
probes
far
*NL*
deeper
than
the
evil
.
Leonard
was
driven
straight
through
*NL*
its
torments
and
emerged
pure
,
but
enfeebled
--
a
better
man
,
*NL*
who
would
never
lose
control
of
himself
again
,
but
also
a
*NL*
smaller
,
who
had
less
to
control
.
Nor
did
purity
mean
*NL*
peace
.
The
use
of
the
knife
can
become
a
habit
as
hard
to
*NL*
shake
off
as
passion
itself
,
and
Leonard
continued
to
start
*NL*
with
a
cry
out
of
dreams
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
built
up
a
situation
that
was
far
enough
from
the
*NL*
truth
.
It
never
occurred
to
him
that
Helen
was
to
blame
.
*NL*
He
forgot
the
intensity
of
their
talk
,
the
charm
that
had
*NL*
been
lent
him
by
sincerity
,
the
magic
of
Oniton
under
*NL*
darkness
and
of
the
whispering
river
.
Helen
loved
the
*NL*
absolute
.
Leonard
had
been
ruined
absolutely
,
and
had
*NL*
appeared
to
her
as
a
man
apart
,
isolated
from
the
world
.
A
*NL*
real
man
,
who
cared
for
adventure
and
beauty
,
who
desired
to
*NL*
live
decently
and
pay
his
way
,
who
could
have
travelled
more
*NL*
gloriously
through
life
than
the
Juggernaut
car
that
was
*NL*
crushing
him
.
Memories
of
Evie
's
wedding
had
warped
her
,
*NL*
the
starched
servants
,
the
yards
of
uneaten
food
,
the
rustle
*NL*
of
overdressed
women
,
motor-cars
oozing
grease
on
the
*NL*
gravel
,
rubbish
on
a
pretentious
band
.
She
had
tasted
the
*NL*
lees
of
this
on
her
arrival
:
in
the
darkness
,
after
failure
,
*NL*
they
intoxicated
her
.
She
and
the
victim
seemed
alone
in
a
*NL*
world
of
unreality
,
and
she
loved
him
absolutely
,
perhaps
*NL*
for
half
an
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
she
was
gone
.
The
note
that
she
left
,
*NL*
tender
and
hysterical
in
tone
,
and
intended
to
be
most
kind
,
*NL*
hurt
her
lover
terribly
.
It
was
as
if
some
work
of
art
had
*NL*
been
broken
by
him
,
some
picture
in
the
National
Gallery
*NL*
slashed
out
of
its
frame
.
When
he
recalled
her
talents
and
*NL*
her
social
position
,
he
felt
that
the
first
passerby
had
a
*NL*
right
to
shoot
him
down
.
He
was
afraid
of
the
waitress
and
*NL*
the
porters
at
the
railway-station
.
He
was
afraid
at
first
*NL*
of
his
wife
,
though
later
he
was
to
regard
her
with
a
*NL*
strange
new
tenderness
,
and
to
think
,
``
There
is
nothing
to
*NL*
choose
between
us
,
after
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
expedition
to
Shropshire
crippled
the
Basts
*NL*
permanently
.
Helen
in
her
flight
forgot
to
settle
the
hotel
*NL*
bill
,
and
took
their
return
tickets
away
with
her
;
they
had
*NL*
to
pawn
Jacky
's
bangles
to
get
home
,
and
the
smash
came
a
*NL*
few
days
afterwards
.
It
is
true
that
Helen
offered
him
five
*NL*
thousands
pounds
,
but
such
a
sum
meant
nothing
to
him
.
He
*NL*
could
not
see
that
the
girl
was
desperately
righting
*NL*
herself
,
and
trying
to
save
something
out
of
the
disaster
,
*NL*
if
it
was
only
five
thousand
pounds
.
But
he
had
to
live
*NL*
somehow
.
He
turned
to
his
family
,
and
degraded
himself
to
a
*NL*
professional
beggar
.
There
was
nothing
else
for
him
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
letter
from
Leonard
,
''
thought
Blanche
,
his
sister
;
*NL*
``
and
after
all
this
time
.
''
She
hid
it
,
so
that
her
husband
*NL*
should
not
see
,
and
when
he
had
gone
to
his
work
read
it
*NL*
with
some
emotion
,
and
sent
the
prodigal
a
little
money
out
*NL*
of
her
dress
allowance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
letter
from
Leonard
!
''
said
the
other
sister
,
Laura
,
a
*NL*
few
days
later
.
She
showed
it
to
her
husband
.
He
wrote
a
*NL*
cruel
insolent
reply
,
but
sent
more
money
than
Blanche
,
so
*NL*
Leonard
soon
wrote
to
him
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
during
the
winter
the
system
was
developed
.
Leonard
*NL*
realized
that
they
need
never
starve
,
because
it
would
be
*NL*
too
painful
for
his
relatives
.
Society
is
based
on
the
*NL*
family
,
and
the
clever
wastrel
can
exploit
this
*NL*
indefinitely
.
Without
a
generous
thought
on
either
side
,
*NL*
pounds
and
pounds
passed
.
The
donors
disliked
Leonard
,
and
*NL*
he
grew
to
hate
them
intensely
.
When
Laura
censured
his
*NL*
immoral
marriage
,
he
thought
bitterly
,
``
She
minds
that
!
*NL*
What
would
she
say
if
she
knew
the
truth
?
''
When
Blanche
's
*NL*
husband
offered
him
work
,
he
found
some
pretext
for
avoiding
*NL*
it
.
He
had
wanted
work
keenly
at
Oniton
,
but
too
much
*NL*
anxiety
had
shattered
him
;
he
was
joining
the
unemployable
.
*NL*
When
his
brother
,
the
lay-reader
,
did
not
reply
to
a
letter
,
*NL*
he
wrote
again
,
saying
that
he
and
Jacky
would
come
down
to
*NL*
his
village
on
foot
.
He
did
not
intend
this
as
blackmail
.
*NL*
Still
,
the
brother
sent
a
postal
order
,
and
it
became
part
*NL*
of
the
system
.
And
so
passed
his
winter
and
his
spring
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
horror
there
are
two
bright
spots
.
He
never
*NL*
confused
the
past
.
He
remained
alive
,
and
blessed
are
those
*NL*
who
live
,
if
it
is
only
to
a
sense
of
sinfulness
.
The
*NL*
anodyne
of
muddledom
,
by
which
most
men
blur
and
blend
their
*NL*
mistakes
,
never
passed
Leonard
's
lips
--
*NL*
*NL*
And
if
I
drink
oblivion
of
a
day
,
*NL*
So
shorten
I
the
stature
of
my
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
a
hard
saying
,
and
a
hard
man
wrote
it
,
but
it
*NL*
lies
at
the
foot
of
all
character
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
other
bright
spot
was
his
tenderness
for
Jacky
.
*NL*
He
pitied
her
with
nobility
now
--
not
the
contemptuous
pity
*NL*
of
a
man
who
sticks
to
a
woman
through
thick
and
thin
.
He
*NL*
tried
to
be
less
irritable
.
He
wondered
what
her
hungry
*NL*
eyes
desired
--
nothing
that
she
could
express
,
or
that
he
or
*NL*
any
man
could
give
her
.
Would
she
ever
receive
the
justice
*NL*
that
is
mercy
--
the
justice
for
by-products
that
the
world
is
*NL*
too
busy
to
bestow
?
She
was
fond
of
flowers
,
generous
with
*NL*
money
,
and
not
revengeful
.
If
she
had
borne
him
a
child
he
*NL*
might
have
cared
for
her
.
Unmarried
,
Leonard
would
never
*NL*
have
begged
;
he
would
have
flickered
out
and
died
.
But
the
*NL*
whole
of
life
is
mixed
.
He
had
to
provide
for
Jacky
,
and
*NL*
went
down
dirty
paths
that
she
might
have
a
few
feathers
and
*NL*
dishes
of
food
that
suited
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
he
caught
sight
of
Margaret
and
her
brother
.
He
*NL*
was
in
St.
Paul
's
.
He
had
entered
the
cathedral
partly
to
*NL*
avoid
the
rain
and
partly
to
see
a
picture
that
had
educated
*NL*
him
in
former
years
.
But
the
light
was
bad
,
the
picture
ill
*NL*
placed
,
and
Time
and
Judgment
were
inside
him
now
.
Death
*NL*
alone
still
charmed
him
,
with
her
lap
of
poppies
,
on
which
*NL*
all
men
shall
sleep
.
He
took
one
glance
,
and
turned
*NL*
aimlessly
away
towards
a
chair
.
Then
down
the
nave
he
saw
*NL*
Miss
Schlegel
and
her
brother
.
They
stood
in
the
fairway
of
*NL*
passengers
,
and
their
faces
were
extremely
grave
.
He
was
*NL*
perfectly
certain
that
they
were
in
trouble
about
their
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
outside
--
and
he
fled
immediately
--
he
wished
that
he
*NL*
had
spoken
to
them
.
What
was
his
life
?
What
were
a
few
*NL*
angry
words
,
or
even
imprisonment
?
He
had
done
wrong
--
that
*NL*
was
the
true
terror
.
Whatever
they
might
know
,
he
would
*NL*
tell
them
everything
he
knew
.
He
re-entered
St.
Paul
's
.
*NL*
But
they
had
moved
in
his
absence
,
and
had
gone
to
lay
their
*NL*
difficulties
before
Mr.
Wilcox
and
Charles
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sight
of
Margaret
turned
remorse
into
new
channels
.
*NL*
He
desired
to
confess
,
and
though
the
desire
is
proof
of
a
*NL*
weakened
nature
,
which
is
about
to
lose
the
essence
of
human
*NL*
intercourse
,
it
did
not
take
an
ignoble
form
.
He
did
not
*NL*
suppose
that
confession
would
bring
him
happiness
.
It
was
*NL*
rather
that
he
yearned
to
get
clear
of
the
tangle
.
So
does
*NL*
the
suicide
yearn
.
The
impulses
are
akin
,
and
the
crime
of
*NL*
suicide
lies
rather
in
its
disregard
for
the
feelings
of
*NL*
those
whom
we
leave
behind
.
Confession
need
harm
no
one
--
it
*NL*
can
satisfy
that
test
--
and
though
it
was
un-English
,
and
*NL*
ignored
by
our
Anglican
cathedral
,
Leonard
had
a
right
to
*NL*
decide
upon
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
he
trusted
Margaret
.
He
wanted
her
hardness
*NL*
now
.
That
cold
,
intellectual
nature
of
hers
would
be
just
,
*NL*
if
unkind
.
He
would
do
whatever
she
told
him
,
even
if
he
*NL*
had
to
see
Helen
.
That
was
the
supreme
punishment
she
would
*NL*
exact
.
And
perhaps
she
would
tell
him
how
Helen
was
.
That
*NL*
was
the
supreme
reward
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
knew
nothing
about
Margaret
,
not
even
whether
she
was
*NL*
married
to
Mr.
Wilcox
,
and
tracking
her
out
took
several
*NL*
days
.
That
evening
he
toiled
through
the
wet
to
Wickham
*NL*
Place
,
where
the
new
flats
were
now
appearing
.
Was
he
also
*NL*
the
cause
of
their
move
?
Were
they
expelled
from
society
on
*NL*
his
account
?
Thence
to
a
public
library
,
but
could
find
no
*NL*
satisfactory
Schlegel
in
the
directory
.
On
the
morrow
he
*NL*
searched
again
.
He
hung
about
outside
Mr.
Wilcox
's
office
*NL*
at
lunch
time
,
and
,
as
the
clerks
came
out
said
:
``
Excuse
me
,
*NL*
sir
,
but
is
your
boss
married
?
''
Most
of
them
stared
,
some
*NL*
said
,
``
What
's
that
to
you
?
''
but
one
,
who
had
not
yet
*NL*
acquired
reticence
,
told
him
what
he
wished
.
Leonard
could
*NL*
not
learn
the
private
address
.
That
necessitated
more
*NL*
trouble
with
directories
and
tubes
.
Ducie
Street
was
not
*NL*
discovered
till
the
Monday
,
the
day
that
Margaret
and
her
*NL*
husband
went
down
on
their
hunting
expedition
to
Howards
End
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
called
at
about
four
o'clock
.
The
weather
had
*NL*
changed
,
and
the
sun
shone
gaily
on
the
ornamental
*NL*
steps
--
black
and
white
marble
in
triangles
.
Leonard
lowered
*NL*
his
eyes
to
them
after
ringing
the
bell
.
He
felt
in
curious
*NL*
health
:
doors
seemed
to
be
opening
and
shutting
inside
his
*NL*
body
,
and
he
had
been
obliged
to
steep
sitting
up
in
bed
,
*NL*
with
his
back
propped
against
the
wall
.
When
the
*NL*
parlourmaid
came
he
could
not
see
her
face
;
the
brown
rain
*NL*
had
descended
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
Mrs.
Wilcox
live
here
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
out
,
''
was
the
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
will
she
be
back
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
ask
,
''
said
the
parlourmaid
.
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
had
given
instructions
that
no
one
who
*NL*
mentioned
her
name
should
ever
be
rebuffed
.
Putting
the
*NL*
door
on
the
chain
--
for
Leonard
's
appearance
demanded
*NL*
this
--
she
went
through
to
the
smoking-room
,
which
was
*NL*
occupied
by
Tibby
.
Tibby
was
asleep
.
He
had
had
a
good
*NL*
lunch
.
Charles
Wilcox
had
not
yet
rung
him
up
for
the
*NL*
distracting
interview
.
He
said
drowsily
:
``
I
do
n't
know
.
*NL*
Hilton
.
Howards
End
.
Who
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
ask
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
do
n't
bother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
have
taken
the
car
to
Howards
End
,
''
said
the
*NL*
parlourmaid
to
Leonard
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
thanked
her
,
and
asked
whereabouts
that
place
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
appear
to
want
to
know
a
good
deal
,
''
she
remarked
.
*NL*
But
Margaret
had
forbidden
her
to
be
mysterious
.
She
told
*NL*
him
against
her
better
judgment
that
Howards
End
was
in
*NL*
Hertfordshire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
a
village
,
please
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Village
!
It
's
Mr.
Wilcox
's
private
house
--
at
least
,
*NL*
it
's
one
of
them
.
Mrs.
Wilcox
keeps
her
furniture
there
.
*NL*
Hilton
is
the
village
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
And
when
will
they
be
back
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Schlegel
does
n't
know
.
We
ca
n't
know
everything
,
*NL*
can
we
?
''
She
shut
him
out
,
and
went
to
attend
to
the
*NL*
telephone
,
which
was
ringing
furiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
loitered
away
another
night
of
agony
.
Confession
*NL*
grew
more
difficult
.
As
soon
as
possible
he
went
to
bed
.
*NL*
He
watched
a
patch
of
moonlight
cross
the
floor
of
their
*NL*
lodging
,
and
,
as
sometimes
happens
when
the
mind
is
*NL*
overtaxed
,
he
fell
asleep
for
the
rest
of
the
room
,
but
kept
*NL*
awake
for
the
patch
of
moonlight
.
Horrible
!
Then
began
one
*NL*
of
those
disintegrating
dialogues
.
Part
of
him
said
:
``
Why
*NL*
horrible
?
It
's
ordinary
light
from
the
room
.
''
``
But
it
*NL*
moves
.
''
``
So
does
the
moon
.
''
``
But
it
is
a
clenched
fist
.
''
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
''
``
But
it
is
going
to
touch
me
.
''
``
Let
it
.
''
And
,
*NL*
seeming
to
gather
motion
,
the
patch
ran
up
his
blanket
.
*NL*
Presently
a
blue
snake
appeared
;
then
another
,
parallel
to
*NL*
it
.
``
Is
there
life
in
the
moon
?
''
``
Of
course
.
''
``
But
I
*NL*
thought
it
was
uninhabited
.
''
``
Not
by
Time
,
Death
,
Judgment
,
*NL*
and
the
smaller
snakes
.
''
``
Smaller
snakes
!
''
said
Leonard
*NL*
indignantly
and
aloud
.
``
What
a
notion
!
''
By
a
rending
*NL*
effort
of
the
will
he
woke
the
rest
of
the
room
up
.
Jacky
,
*NL*
the
bed
,
their
food
,
their
clothes
on
the
chair
,
gradually
*NL*
entered
his
consciousness
,
and
the
horror
vanished
outwards
,
*NL*
like
a
ring
that
is
spreading
through
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
Jacky
,
I
'm
going
out
for
a
bit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
breathing
regularly
.
The
patch
of
light
fell
*NL*
clear
of
the
striped
blanket
,
and
began
to
cover
the
shawl
*NL*
that
lay
over
her
feet
.
Why
had
he
been
afraid
?
He
went
to
*NL*
the
window
,
and
saw
that
the
moon
was
descending
through
a
*NL*
clear
sky
.
He
saw
her
volcanoes
,
and
the
bright
expanses
*NL*
that
a
gracious
error
has
named
seas
.
They
paled
,
for
the
*NL*
sun
,
who
had
lit
them
up
,
was
coming
to
light
the
earth
.
*NL*
Sea
of
Serenity
,
Sea
of
Tranquillity
,
Ocean
of
the
Lunar
*NL*
Storms
,
merged
into
one
lucent
drop
,
itself
to
slip
into
the
*NL*
sempiternal
dawn
.
And
he
had
been
afraid
of
the
moon
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
dressed
among
the
contending
lights
,
and
went
through
*NL*
his
money
.
It
was
running
low
again
,
but
enough
for
a
*NL*
return
ticket
to
Hilton
.
As
it
clinked
Jacky
opened
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hullo
,
Len
!
What
ho
,
Len
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
ho
,
Jacky
!
see
you
again
later
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
over
and
slept
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
house
was
unlocked
,
their
landlord
being
a
salesman
*NL*
at
Convent
Garden
.
Leonard
passed
out
and
made
his
way
down
*NL*
to
the
station
.
The
train
,
though
it
did
not
start
for
an
*NL*
hour
,
was
already
drawn
up
at
the
end
of
the
platform
,
and
*NL*
he
lay
down
in
it
and
slept
.
With
the
first
jolt
he
was
in
*NL*
daylight
;
they
had
left
the
gateways
of
King
's
Cross
,
and
*NL*
were
under
blue
sky
.
Tunnels
followed
,
and
after
each
the
*NL*
sky
grew
bluer
,
and
from
the
embankment
at
Finsbury
Park
he
*NL*
had
his
first
sight
of
the
sun
.
It
rolled
along
behind
the
*NL*
eastern
smokes
--
a
wheel
,
whose
fellow
was
the
descending
*NL*
moon
--
and
as
yet
it
seemed
the
servant
of
the
blue
sky
,
not
*NL*
its
lord
.
He
dozed
again
.
Over
Tewin
Water
it
was
day
.
To
*NL*
the
left
fell
the
shadow
of
the
embankment
and
its
arches
;
*NL*
to
the
right
Leonard
saw
up
into
the
Tewin
Woods
and
towards
*NL*
the
church
,
with
its
wild
legend
of
immortality
.
Six
forest
*NL*
trees
--
that
is
a
fact
--
grow
out
of
one
of
the
graves
in
*NL*
Tewin
churchyard
.
The
grave
's
occupant
--
that
is
the
*NL*
legend
--
is
an
atheist
,
who
declared
that
if
God
existed
,
six
*NL*
forest
trees
would
grow
out
of
her
grave
.
These
things
in
*NL*
Hertfordshire
;
and
farther
afield
lay
the
house
of
a
*NL*
hermit
--
Mrs.
Wilcox
had
known
him
--
who
barred
himself
up
,
*NL*
and
wrote
prophecies
,
and
gave
all
he
had
to
the
poor
.
*NL*
While
,
powdered
in
between
,
were
the
villas
of
business
men
,
*NL*
who
saw
life
more
steadily
,
though
with
the
steadiness
of
*NL*
the
half-closed
eye
.
Over
all
the
sun
was
streaming
,
to
all
*NL*
the
birds
were
singing
,
to
all
the
primroses
were
yellow
,
*NL*
and
the
speedwell
blue
,
and
the
country
,
however
they
*NL*
interpreted
her
,
was
uttering
her
cry
of
``
now
.
''
She
did
not
*NL*
free
Leonard
yet
,
and
the
knife
plunged
deeper
into
his
*NL*
heart
as
the
train
drew
up
at
Hilton
.
But
remorse
had
*NL*
become
beautiful
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hilton
was
asleep
,
or
at
the
earliest
,
breakfasting
.
*NL*
Leonard
noticed
the
contrast
when
he
stepped
out
of
it
into
*NL*
the
country
.
Here
men
had
been
up
since
dawn
.
Their
hours
*NL*
were
ruled
,
not
by
a
London
office
,
but
by
the
movements
of
*NL*
the
crops
and
the
sun
.
That
they
were
men
of
the
finest
*NL*
type
only
the
sentimentalist
can
declare
.
But
they
kept
to
*NL*
the
life
of
daylight
.
They
are
England
's
hope
.
Clumsily
*NL*
they
carry
forward
the
torch
of
the
sun
,
until
such
time
as
*NL*
the
nation
sees
fit
to
take
it
up
.
Half
clodhopper
,
half
*NL*
board-school
prig
,
they
can
still
throw
back
to
a
nobler
*NL*
stock
,
and
breed
yeomen
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
chalk
pit
a
motor
passed
him
.
In
it
was
another
*NL*
type
,
whom
Nature
favours
--
the
Imperial
.
Healthy
,
ever
in
*NL*
motion
,
it
hopes
to
inherit
the
earth
.
It
breeds
as
quickly
*NL*
as
the
yeoman
,
and
as
soundly
;
strong
is
the
temptation
to
*NL*
acclaim
it
as
a
super-yeoman
,
who
carries
his
country
's
*NL*
virtue
overseas
.
But
the
Imperialist
is
not
what
he
thinks
*NL*
or
seems
.
He
is
a
destroyer
.
He
prepares
the
way
for
*NL*
cosmopolitanism
,
and
though
his
ambitions
may
be
fulfilled
,
*NL*
the
earth
that
he
inherits
will
be
grey
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
Leonard
,
intent
on
his
private
sin
,
there
came
the
*NL*
conviction
of
innate
goodness
elsewhere
.
It
was
not
the
*NL*
optimism
which
he
had
been
taught
at
school
.
Again
and
*NL*
again
must
the
drums
tap
,
and
the
goblins
stalk
over
the
*NL*
universe
before
joy
can
be
purged
of
the
superficial
.
It
*NL*
was
rather
paradoxical
,
and
arose
from
his
sorrow
.
Death
*NL*
destroys
a
man
,
but
the
idea
of
death
saves
him
--
that
is
the
*NL*
best
account
of
it
that
has
yet
been
given
.
Squalor
and
*NL*
tragedy
can
beckon
to
all
that
is
great
in
us
,
and
*NL*
strengthen
the
wings
of
love
.
They
can
beckon
;
it
is
not
*NL*
certain
that
they
will
,
for
they
are
not
love
's
servants
.
*NL*
But
they
can
beckon
,
and
the
knowledge
of
this
incredible
*NL*
truth
comforted
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
approached
the
house
all
thought
stopped
.
*NL*
Contradictory
notions
stood
side
by
side
in
his
mind
.
He
*NL*
was
terrified
but
happy
,
ashamed
,
but
had
done
no
sin
.
He
*NL*
knew
the
confession
:
``
Mrs.
Wilcox
,
I
have
done
wrong
,
''
but
*NL*
sunrise
had
robbed
its
meaning
,
and
he
felt
rather
on
a
*NL*
supreme
adventure
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
entered
a
garden
,
steadied
himself
against
a
*NL*
motor-car
that
he
found
in
it
,
found
a
door
open
and
entered
*NL*
a
house
.
Yes
,
it
would
be
very
easy
.
From
a
room
to
the
*NL*
left
he
heard
voices
,
Margaret
's
amongst
them
.
His
own
name
*NL*
was
called
aloud
,
and
a
man
whom
he
had
never
seen
said
,
*NL*
``
Oh
,
is
he
there
?
I
am
not
surprised
.
I
now
thrash
him
*NL*
within
an
inch
of
his
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Wilcox
,
''
said
Leonard
,
``
I
have
done
wrong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
took
him
by
the
collar
and
cried
,
``
Bring
me
a
*NL*
stick
.
''
Women
were
screaming
.
A
stick
,
very
bright
,
*NL*
descended
.
It
hurt
him
,
not
where
it
descended
,
but
in
the
*NL*
heart
.
Books
fell
over
him
in
a
shower
.
Nothing
had
sense
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
some
water
,
''
commanded
Charles
,
who
had
all
through
*NL*
kept
very
calm
.
``
He
's
shamming
.
Of
course
I
only
used
the
*NL*
blade
.
Here
,
carry
him
out
into
the
air
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thinking
that
he
understood
these
things
,
Margaret
*NL*
obeyed
him
.
They
laid
Leonard
,
who
was
dead
,
on
the
gravel
;
*NL*
Helen
poured
water
over
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
enough
,
''
said
Charles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
murder
's
enough
,
''
said
Miss
Avery
,
coming
out
of
*NL*
the
house
with
the
sword
.

Chapter
42
*NL*
*NL*
When
Charles
left
Ducie
Street
he
had
caught
the
first
train
*NL*
home
,
but
had
no
inkling
of
the
newest
development
until
*NL*
late
at
night
.
Then
his
father
,
who
had
dined
alone
,
sent
*NL*
for
him
,
and
in
very
grave
tones
inquired
for
Margaret
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
where
she
is
,
pater
,
''
said
Charles
.
*NL*
``
Dolly
kept
back
dinner
nearly
an
hour
for
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
when
she
comes
in
--
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Another
hour
passed
.
The
servants
went
to
bed
,
and
*NL*
Charles
visited
his
father
again
,
to
receive
further
*NL*
instructions
.
Mrs.
Wilcox
had
still
not
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
sit
up
for
her
as
late
as
you
like
,
but
she
can
*NL*
hardly
be
coming
.
Is
n't
she
stopping
with
her
sister
at
the
*NL*
hotel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
,
''
said
Mr.
Wilcox
thoughtfully
--
``
perhaps
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
I
do
anything
for
you
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
tonight
,
my
boy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Wilcox
liked
being
called
sir
.
He
raised
his
eyes
*NL*
and
gave
his
son
more
open
a
look
of
tenderness
than
he
*NL*
usually
ventured
.
He
saw
Charles
as
little
boy
and
strong
*NL*
man
in
one
.
Though
his
wife
had
proved
unstable
his
*NL*
children
were
left
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
midnight
he
tapped
on
Charles
's
door
.
``
I
ca
n't
*NL*
sleep
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
had
better
have
a
talk
with
you
and
get
*NL*
it
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
complained
of
the
heat
.
Charles
took
him
out
into
*NL*
the
garden
,
and
they
paced
up
and
down
in
their
*NL*
dressing-gowns
.
Charles
became
very
quiet
as
the
story
*NL*
unrolled
;
he
had
known
all
along
that
Margaret
was
as
bad
as
*NL*
her
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
will
feel
differently
in
the
morning
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Wilcox
,
who
had
of
course
said
nothing
about
Mrs.
Bast
.
*NL*
``
But
I
can
not
let
this
kind
of
thing
continue
without
*NL*
comment
.
I
am
morally
certain
that
she
is
with
her
sister
*NL*
at
Howards
End
.
The
house
is
mine
--
and
,
Charles
,
it
will
be
*NL*
yours
--
and
when
I
say
that
no
one
is
to
live
there
,
I
mean
*NL*
that
no
one
is
to
live
there
.
I
wo
n't
have
it
.
''
He
looked
*NL*
angrily
at
the
moon
.
``
To
my
mind
this
question
is
connected
*NL*
with
something
far
greater
,
the
rights
of
property
itself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Undoubtedly
,
''
said
Charles
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Wilcox
linked
his
arm
in
his
son
's
,
but
somehow
*NL*
liked
him
less
as
he
told
him
more
.
``
I
do
n't
want
you
to
*NL*
conclude
that
my
wife
and
I
had
anything
of
the
nature
of
a
*NL*
quarrel
.
She
was
only
over-wrought
,
as
who
would
not
be
?
I
*NL*
shall
do
what
I
can
for
Helen
,
but
on
the
understanding
that
*NL*
they
clear
out
of
the
house
at
once
.
Do
you
see
?
That
is
a
*NL*
sine
qua
non
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
at
eight
tomorrow
I
may
go
up
in
the
car
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eight
or
earlier
.
Say
that
you
are
acting
as
my
*NL*
representative
,
and
,
of
course
,
use
no
violence

Charles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
morrow
,
as
Charles
returned
,
leaving
Leonard
dead
*NL*
upon
the
gravel
,
it
did
not
seem
to
him
that
he
had
used
*NL*
violence
.
Death
was
due
to
heart
disease
.
His
stepmother
*NL*
herself
had
said
so
,
and
even
Miss
Avery
had
acknowledged
*NL*
that
he
only
used
the
flat
of
the
sword
.
On
his
way
through
*NL*
the
village
he
informed
the
police
,
who
thanked
him
,
and
*NL*
said
there
must
be
an
inquest
.
He
found
his
father
in
the
*NL*
garden
shading
his
eyes
from
the
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
has
been
pretty
horrible
,
''
said
Charles
gravely
.
*NL*
``
They
were
there
,
and
they
had
the
man
up
there
with
them
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
--
what
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
you
last
night
.
His
name
was
Bast
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
God
,
is
it
possible
?
''
said
Mr.
Wilcox
.
``
In
your
*NL*
mother
's
house
!
Charles
,
in
your
mother
's
house
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
,
pater
.
That
was
what
I
felt
.
As
a
matter
of
*NL*
fact
,
there
is
no
need
to
trouble
about
the
man
.
He
was
in
*NL*
the
last
stages
of
heart
disease
,
and
just
before
I
could
*NL*
show
him
what
I
thought
of
him
he
went
off
.
The
police
are
*NL*
seeing
about
it
at
this
moment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Wilcox
listened
attentively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
got
up
there
--
oh
,
it
could
n't
have
been
more
than
*NL*
half-past
seven
.
The
Avery
woman
was
lighting
a
fire
for
*NL*
them
.
They
were
still
upstairs
.
I
waited
in
the
*NL*
drawing-room
.
We
were
all
moderately
civil
and
collected
,
*NL*
though
I
had
my
suspicions
.
I
gave
them
your
message
,
and
*NL*
Mrs.
Wilcox
said
,
`
Oh
yes
,
I
see
;
yes
,
'
in
that
way
of
hers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
else
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
promised
to
tell
you
,
`
with
her
love
,
'
that
she
was
*NL*
going
to
Germany
with
her
sister
this
evening
.
That
was
all
*NL*
we
had
time
for
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Wilcox
seemed
relieved
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
by
then
I
suppose
the
man
got
tired
of
hiding
,
*NL*
for
suddenly
Mrs.
Wilcox
screamed
out
his
name
.
I
*NL*
recognized
it
,
and
I
went
for
him
in
the
hall
.
Was
I
right
,
*NL*
pater
?
I
thought
things
were
going
a
little
too
far
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Right
,
my
dear
boy
?
I
do
n't
know
.
But
you
would
have
*NL*
been
no
son
of
mine
if
you
had
n't
.
Then
did
he
*NL*
just
--
just
--
crumple
up
as
you
said
?
''
He
shrunk
from
the
*NL*
simple
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
caught
hold
of
the
bookcase
,
which
came
down
over
*NL*
him
.
So
I
merely
put
the
sword
down
and
carried
him
into
*NL*
the
garden
.
We
all
thought
he
was
shamming
.
However
,
he
's
*NL*
dead
right
enough
.
Awful
business
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sword
?
''
cried
his
father
,
with
anxiety
in
his
voice
.
*NL*
``
What
sword
?
Whose
sword
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
sword
of
theirs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
were
you
doing
with
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
did
n't
you
see
,
pater
,
I
had
to
snatch
up
the
*NL*
first
thing
handy
I
had
n't
a
riding-whip
or
stick
.
I
caught
*NL*
him
once
or
twice
over
the
shoulders
with
the
flat
of
their
*NL*
old
German
sword
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
pulled
over
the
bookcase
,
as
I
said
,
and
fell
,
''
said
*NL*
Charles
,
with
a
sigh
.
It
was
no
fun
doing
errands
for
his
*NL*
father
,
who
was
never
quite
satisfied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
real
cause
was
heart
disease
?
Of
that
you
're
sure
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
or
a
fit
.
However
,
we
shall
hear
more
than
enough
*NL*
at
the
inquest
on
such
unsavoury
topics
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
into
breakfast
.
Charles
had
a
racking
*NL*
headache
,
consequent
on
motoring
before
food
.
He
was
also
*NL*
anxious
about
the
future
,
reflecting
that
the
police
must
*NL*
detain
Helen
and
Margaret
for
the
inquest
and
ferret
the
*NL*
whole
thing
out
.
He
saw
himself
obliged
to
leave
Hilton
.
*NL*
One
could
not
afford
to
live
near
the
scene
of
a
scandal
--
it
*NL*
was
not
fair
on
one
's
wife
.
His
comfort
was
that
the
*NL*
pater
's
eyes
were
opened
at
last
.
There
would
be
a
horrible
*NL*
smash
up
,
and
probably
a
separation
from
Margaret
;
then
they
*NL*
would
all
start
again
,
more
as
they
had
been
in
his
mother
's
*NL*
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
'll
go
round
to
the
police-station
,
''
said
his
*NL*
father
when
breakfast
was
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
for
?
''
cried
Dolly
,
who
had
still
not
been
``
told
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
sir
.
Which
car
will
you
have
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
'll
walk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
good
half-mile
,
''
said
Charles
,
stepping
into
the
*NL*
garden
.
``
The
sun
's
very
hot
for
April
.
Sha
n't
I
take
you
*NL*
up
,
and
then
,
perhaps
,
a
little
spin
round
by
Tewin
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
go
on
as
if
I
did
n't
know
my
own
mind
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Wilcox
fretfully
.
Charles
hardened
his
mouth
.
``
You
young
*NL*
fellows
'
one
idea
is
to
get
into
a
motor
.
I
tell
you
,
I
*NL*
want
to
walk
:
I
'm
very
fond
of
walking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
all
right
;
I
'm
about
the
house
if
you
want
me
for
*NL*
anything
.
I
thought
of
not
going
up
to
the
office
today
,
if
*NL*
that
is
your
wish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
,
indeed
,
my
boy
,
''
said
Mr.
Wilcox
,
and
laid
a
*NL*
hand
on
his
sleeve
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
did
not
like
it
;
he
was
uneasy
about
his
father
,
*NL*
who
did
not
seem
himself
this
morning
.
There
was
a
petulant
*NL*
touch
about
him
--
more
like
a
woman
.
Could
it
be
that
he
was
*NL*
growing
old
?
The
Wilcoxes
were
not
lacking
in
affection
;
*NL*
they
had
it
royally
,
but
they
did
not
know
how
to
use
it
.
*NL*
It
was
the
talent
in
the
napkin
,
and
,
for
a
warm-hearted
*NL*
man
,
Charles
had
conveyed
very
little
joy
.
As
he
watched
*NL*
his
father
shuffling
up
the
road
,
he
had
a
vague
regret
--
a
*NL*
wish
that
something
had
been
different
somewhere
--
a
wish
*NL*
-LRB-
though
he
did
not
express
it
thus
-RRB-
that
he
had
been
taught
*NL*
to
say
``
I
''
in
his
youth
.
He
meant
to
make
up
for
Margaret
's
*NL*
defection
,
but
knew
that
his
father
had
been
very
happy
with
*NL*
her
until
yesterday
.
How
had
she
done
it
?
By
some
*NL*
dishonest
trick
,
no
doubt
--
but
how
?
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Wilcox
reappeared
at
eleven
,
looking
very
tired
.
*NL*
There
was
to
be
an
inquest
on
Leonard
's
'
body
tomorrow
,
and
*NL*
the
police
required
his
son
to
attend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
expected
that
,
''
said
Charles
.
``
I
shall
naturally
be
*NL*
the
most
important
witness
there
.

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
43
*NL*
*NL*
Out
of
the
turmoil
and
horror
that
had
begun
with
Aunt
*NL*
Juley
's
illness
and
was
not
even
to
end
with
Leonard
's
*NL*
death
,
it
seemed
impossible
to
Margaret
that
healthy
life
*NL*
should
re-emerge
.
Events
succeeded
in
a
logical
,
yet
*NL*
senseless
,
train
.
People
lost
their
humanity
,
and
took
*NL*
values
as
arbitrary
as
those
in
a
pack
of
playing-cards
.
It
*NL*
was
natural
that
Henry
should
do
this
and
cause
Helen
to
do
*NL*
that
,
and
then
think
her
wrong
for
doing
it
;
natural
that
*NL*
she
herself
should
think
him
wrong
;
natural
that
Leonard
*NL*
should
want
to
know
how
Helen
was
,
and
come
,
and
Charles
be
*NL*
angry
with
him
for
coming
--
natural
,
but
unreal
.
In
this
*NL*
jangle
of
causes
and
effects
what
had
become
of
their
true
*NL*
selves
?
Here
Leonard
lay
dead
in
the
garden
,
from
natural
*NL*
causes
;
yet
life
was
a
deep
,
deep
river
,
death
a
blue
sky
,
*NL*
life
was
a
house
,
death
a
wisp
of
hay
,
a
flower
,
a
tower
,
*NL*
life
and
death
were
anything
and
everything
,
except
this
*NL*
ordered
insanity
,
where
the
king
takes
the
queen
,
and
the
*NL*
ace
the
king
.
Ah
,
no
;
there
was
beauty
and
adventure
*NL*
behind
,
such
as
the
man
at
her
feet
had
yearned
for
;
there
*NL*
was
hope
this
side
of
the
grave
;
there
were
truer
*NL*
relationships
beyond
the
limits
that
fetter
us
now
.
As
a
*NL*
prisoner
looks
up
and
sees
stars
beckoning
,
so
she
,
from
the
*NL*
turmoil
and
horror
of
those
days
,
caught
glimpses
of
the
*NL*
diviner
wheels
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Helen
,
dumb
with
fright
,
but
trying
to
keep
calm
for
*NL*
the
child
's
sake
,
and
Miss
Avery
,
calm
,
but
murmuring
*NL*
tenderly
,
``
No
one
ever
told
the
lad
he
'll
have
a
*NL*
child
''
--
they
also
reminded
her
that
horror
is
not
the
end
.
*NL*
To
what
ultimate
harmony
we
tend
she
did
not
know
,
but
there
*NL*
seemed
great
chance
that
a
child
would
be
born
into
the
*NL*
world
,
to
take
the
great
chances
of
beauty
and
adventure
*NL*
that
the
world
offers
.
She
moved
through
the
sunlit
garden
,
*NL*
gathering
narcissi
,
crimson-eyed
and
white
.
There
was
*NL*
nothing
else
to
be
done
;
the
time
for
telegrams
and
anger
*NL*
was
over
,
and
it
seemed
wisest
that
the
hands
of
Leonard
*NL*
should
be
folded
on
his
breast
and
be
filled
with
flowers
.
*NL*
Here
was
the
father
;
leave
it
at
that
.
Let
Squalor
be
*NL*
turned
into
Tragedy
,
whose
eyes
are
the
stars
,
and
whose
*NL*
hands
hold
the
sunset
and
the
dawn
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
even
the
influx
of
officials
,
even
the
return
of
the
*NL*
doctor
,
vulgar
and
acute
,
could
not
shake
her
belief
in
the
*NL*
eternity
of
beauty
.
Science
explained
people
,
but
could
not
*NL*
understand
them
.
After
long
centuries
among
the
bones
and
*NL*
muscles
it
might
be
advancing
to
knowledge
of
the
nerves
,
*NL*
but
this
would
never
give
understanding
.
One
could
open
the
*NL*
heart
to
Mr.
Mansbridge
and
his
sort
without
discovering
its
*NL*
secrets
to
them
,
for
they
wanted
everything
down
in
black
*NL*
and
white
,
and
black
and
white
was
exactly
what
they
were
*NL*
left
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
questioned
her
closely
about
Charles
.
She
never
*NL*
suspected
why
.
Death
had
come
,
and
the
doctor
agreed
that
*NL*
it
was
due
to
heart
disease
.
They
asked
to
see
her
father
's
*NL*
sword
.
She
explained
that
Charles
's
anger
was
natural
,
but
*NL*
mistaken
.
Miserable
questions
about
Leonard
followed
,
all
*NL*
of
which
she
answered
unfalteringly
.
Then
back
to
Charles
*NL*
again
.
``
No
doubt
Mr.
Wilcox
may
have
induced
death
,
''
she
*NL*
said
;
``
but
if
it
was
n't
one
thing
it
would
have
been
*NL*
another
,
as
you
yourselves
know
.
''
At
last
they
thanked
her
,
*NL*
and
took
the
sword
and
the
body
down
to
Hilton
.
She
began
*NL*
to
pick
up
the
books
from
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Helen
had
gone
to
the
farm
.
It
was
the
best
place
for
*NL*
her
,
since
she
had
to
wait
for
the
inquest
.
Though
,
as
if
*NL*
things
were
not
hard
enough
,
Madge
and
her
husband
had
*NL*
raised
trouble
;
they
did
not
see
why
they
should
receive
the
*NL*
offscourings
of
Howards
End
.
And
,
of
course
,
they
were
*NL*
right
.
The
whole
world
was
going
to
be
right
,
and
amply
*NL*
avenge
any
brave
talk
against
the
conventions
.
``
Nothing
*NL*
matters
,
''
the
Schlegels
had
said
in
the
past
,
``
except
one
's
*NL*
self-respect
and
that
of
one
's
friends
.
''
When
the
time
came
,
*NL*
other
things
mattered
terribly
.
However
,
Madge
had
yielded
,
*NL*
and
Helen
was
assured
of
peace
for
one
day
and
night
,
and
*NL*
tomorrow
she
would
return
to
Germany
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
herself
,
she
determined
to
go
too
.
No
message
*NL*
came
from
Henry
;
perhaps
he
expected
her
to
apologize
.
Now
*NL*
that
she
had
time
to
think
over
her
own
tragedy
,
she
was
*NL*
unrepentant
.
She
neither
forgave
him
for
his
behaviour
nor
*NL*
wished
to
forgive
him
.
Her
speech
to
him
seemed
perfect
.
*NL*
She
would
not
have
altered
a
word
.
It
had
to
be
uttered
*NL*
once
in
a
life
,
to
adjust
the
lopsidedness
of
the
world
.
It
*NL*
was
spoken
not
only
to
her
husband
,
but
to
thousands
of
men
*NL*
like
him
--
a
protest
against
the
inner
darkness
in
high
*NL*
places
that
comes
with
a
commercial
age
.
Though
he
would
*NL*
build
up
his
life
without
hers
,
she
could
not
apologize
.
He
*NL*
had
refused
to
connect
,
on
the
clearest
issue
that
can
be
*NL*
laid
before
a
man
,
and
their
love
must
take
the
consequences
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
,
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
done
.
They
had
tried
*NL*
not
to
go
over
the
precipice
but
perhaps
the
fall
was
*NL*
inevitable
.
And
it
comforted
her
to
think
that
the
future
*NL*
was
certainly
inevitable
:
cause
and
effect
would
go
jangling
*NL*
forward
to
some
goal
doubtless
,
but
to
none
that
she
could
*NL*
imagine
.
At
such
moments
the
soul
retires
within
,
to
float
*NL*
upon
the
bosom
of
a
deeper
stream
,
and
has
communion
with
*NL*
the
dead
,
and
sees
the
world
's
glory
not
diminished
,
but
*NL*
different
in
kind
to
what
she
has
supposed
.
She
alters
her
*NL*
focus
until
trivial
things
are
blurred
.
Margaret
had
been
*NL*
tending
this
way
all
the
winter
.
Leonard
's
death
brought
*NL*
her
to
the
goal
.
Alas
!
that
Henry
should
fade
,
away
as
*NL*
reality
emerged
,
and
only
her
love
for
him
should
remain
*NL*
clear
,
stamped
with
his
image
like
the
cameos
we
rescue
out
*NL*
of
dreams
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
unfaltering
eye
she
traced
his
future
.
He
would
*NL*
soon
present
a
healthy
mind
to
the
world
again
,
and
what
did
*NL*
he
or
the
world
care
if
he
was
rotten
at
the
core
?
He
would
*NL*
grow
into
a
rich
,
jolly
old
man
,
at
times
a
little
*NL*
sentimental
about
women
,
but
emptying
his
glass
with
*NL*
anyone
.
Tenacious
of
power
,
he
would
keep
Charles
and
the
*NL*
rest
dependent
,
and
retire
from
business
reluctantly
and
at
*NL*
an
advanced
age
.
He
would
settle
down
--
though
she
could
not
*NL*
realize
this
.
In
her
eyes
Henry
was
always
moving
and
*NL*
causing
others
to
move
,
until
the
ends
of
the
earth
met
.
*NL*
But
in
time
he
must
get
too
tired
to
move
,
and
settle
down
.
*NL*
What
next
?
The
inevitable
word
.
The
release
of
the
soul
to
*NL*
its
appropriate
Heaven
.
*NL*
*NL*
Would
they
meet
in
it
?
Margaret
believed
in
immortality
*NL*
for
herself
.
An
eternal
future
had
always
seemed
natural
to
*NL*
her
.
And
Henry
believed
in
it
for
himself
.
Yet
,
would
they
*NL*
meet
again
?
Are
there
not
rather
endless
levels
beyond
the
*NL*
grave
,
as
the
theory
that
he
had
censured
teaches
?
And
his
*NL*
level
,
whether
higher
or
lower
,
could
it
possibly
be
the
*NL*
same
as
hers
?
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
gravely
meditating
,
she
was
summoned
by
him
.
He
*NL*
sent
up
Crane
in
the
motor
.
Other
servants
passed
like
*NL*
water
,
but
the
chauffeur
remained
,
though
impertinent
and
*NL*
disloyal
.
Margaret
disliked
Crane
,
and
he
knew
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
the
keys
that
Mr.
Wilcox
wants
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
did
n't
say
,
madam
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
n't
any
note
for
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
did
n't
say
,
madam
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
moment
's
thought
she
locked
up
Howards
End
.
It
*NL*
was
pitiable
to
see
in
it
the
stirrings
of
warmth
that
would
*NL*
be
quenched
for
ever
.
She
raked
out
the
fire
that
was
*NL*
blazing
in
the
kitchen
,
and
spread
the
coals
in
the
*NL*
gravelled
yard
.
She
closed
the
windows
and
drew
the
*NL*
curtains
.
Henry
would
probably
sell
the
place
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
determined
not
to
spare
him
,
for
nothing
new
had
*NL*
happened
as
far
as
they
were
concerned
.
Her
mood
might
*NL*
never
have
altered
from
yesterday
evening
.
He
was
standing
*NL*
a
little
outside
Charles
's
gate
,
and
motioned
the
car
to
*NL*
stop
.
When
his
wife
got
out
he
said
hoarsely
:
``
I
prefer
to
*NL*
discuss
things
with
you
outside
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
be
more
appropriate
in
the
road
,
I
am
afraid
,
''
*NL*
said
Margaret
.
``
Did
you
get
my
message
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
about
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
to
Germany
with
my
sister
.
I
must
tell
you
*NL*
now
that
I
shall
make
it
my
permanent
home
.
Our
talk
last
*NL*
night
was
more
important
than
you
have
realized
.
I
am
*NL*
unable
to
forgive
you
and
am
leaving
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
extremely
tired
,
''
said
Henry
,
in
injured
tones
.
*NL*
``
I
have
been
walking
about
all
the
morning
,
and
wish
to
sit
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
if
you
will
consent
to
sit
on
the
grass
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Great
North
Road
should
have
been
bordered
all
its
*NL*
length
with
glebe
.
Henry
's
kind
had
filched
most
of
it
.
*NL*
She
moved
to
the
scrap
opposite
,
wherein
were
the
Six
*NL*
Hills
.
They
sat
down
on
the
farther
side
,
so
that
they
*NL*
could
not
be
seen
by
Charles
or
Dolly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
are
your
keys
,
''
said
Margaret
.
She
tossed
them
*NL*
towards
him
.
They
fell
on
the
sunlit
slope
of
grass
,
and
he
*NL*
did
not
pick
them
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
something
to
tell
you
,
''
he
said
gently
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
knew
this
superficial
gentleness
,
this
confession
of
*NL*
hastiness
,
that
was
only
intended
to
enhance
her
admiration
*NL*
of
the
male
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
to
hear
it
,
''
she
replied
.
``
My
sister
is
*NL*
going
to
be
ill
.
My
life
is
going
to
be
with
her
now
.
We
*NL*
must
manage
to
build
up
something
,
she
and
I
and
her
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
you
going
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Munich
.
We
start
after
the
inquest
,
if
she
is
not
too
ill

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
the
inquest
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
realized
what
the
verdict
at
the
inquest
will
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
heart
disease
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
my
dear
;
manslaughter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
drove
her
fingers
through
the
grass
.
The
hill
*NL*
beneath
her
moved
as
if
it
was
alive
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Manslaughter
,
''
repeated
Mr.
Wilcox
.
``
Charles
may
go
to
*NL*
prison
.
I
dare
not
tell
him
.
I
do
n't
know
what
to
do
--
what
*NL*
to
do
.
I
'm
broken
--
I
'm
ended
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
sudden
warmth
arose
in
her
.
She
did
not
see
that
to
*NL*
break
him
was
her
only
hope
.
She
did
not
enfold
the
*NL*
sufferer
in
her
arms
.
But
all
through
that
day
and
the
next
*NL*
a
new
life
began
to
move
.
The
verdict
was
brought
in
.
*NL*
Charles
was
committed
for
trial
.
It
was
against
all
reason
*NL*
that
he
should
be
punished
,
but
the
law
,
being
made
in
his
*NL*
image
,
sentenced
him
to
three
years
'
imprisonment
.
Then
*NL*
Henry
's
fortress
gave
way
.
He
could
bear
no
one
but
his
*NL*
wife
,
he
shambled
up
to
Margaret
afterwards
and
asked
her
to
*NL*
do
what
she
could
with
him
.
She
did
what
seemed
*NL*
easiest
--
she
took
him
down
to
recruit
at
Howards
End
.

Chapter
44
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
's
father
was
cutting
the
big
meadow
.
He
passed
again
*NL*
and
again
amid
whirring
blades
and
sweet
odours
of
grass
,
*NL*
encompassing
with
narrowing
circles
the
sacred
centre
of
the
*NL*
field
.
Tom
was
negotiating
with
Helen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
any
idea
,
''
she
replied
.
``
Do
you
suppose
baby
*NL*
may
,
Meg
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
put
down
her
work
and
regarded
them
absently
.
*NL*
``
What
was
that
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom
wants
to
know
whether
baby
is
old
enough
to
play
*NL*
with
hay
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
the
least
notion
,
''
answered
Margaret
,
and
*NL*
took
up
her
work
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Tom
,
baby
is
not
to
stand
;
he
is
not
to
lie
on
his
*NL*
face
;
he
is
not
to
lie
so
that
his
head
wags
;
he
is
not
to
*NL*
be
teased
or
tickled
;
and
he
is
not
to
be
cut
into
two
or
*NL*
more
pieces
by
the
cutter
.
Will
you
be
as
careful
as
all
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
held
out
his
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
child
is
a
wonderful
nursemaid
,
''
remarked
Margaret
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
fond
of
baby
.
That
's
why
he
does
it
!
''
was
*NL*
Helen
's
answer
.
They
're
going
to
be
lifelong
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Starting
at
the
ages
of
six
and
one
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
.
It
will
be
a
great
thing
for
Tom

*NL*

It

*NL*
Fourteen
months
had
passed
,
but
Margaret
still
stopped
*NL*
at
Howards
End
.
No
better
plan
had
occurred
to
her
.
The
*NL*
meadow
was
being
recut
,
the
great
red
poppies
were
reopening
*NL*
in
the
garden
.
July
would
follow
with
the
little
red
*NL*
poppies
among
the
wheat
,
August
with
the
cutting
of
the
*NL*
wheat
.
These
little
events
would
become
part
of
her
year
*NL*
after
year
.
Every
summer
she
would
fear
lest
the
well
*NL*
should
give
out
,
every
winter
lest
the
pipes
should
freeze
;
*NL*
every
westerly
gale
might
blow
the
wych-elm
down
and
bring
*NL*
the
end
of
all
things
,
and
so
she
could
not
read
or
talk
*NL*
during
a
westerly
gale
.
The
air
was
tranquil
now
.
She
and
*NL*
her
sister
were
sitting
on
the
remains
of
Evie
's
mockery
,
*NL*
where
the
lawn
merged
into
the
field
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
time
they
all
are
!
''
said
Helen
.
``
What
can
they
*NL*
be
doing
inside
?
''
Margaret
,
who
was
growing
less
talkative
,
*NL*
made
no
answer
.
The
noise
of
the
cutter
came
*NL*
intermittently
,
like
the
breaking
of
waves
.
Close
by
them
a
*NL*
man
was
preparing
to
scythe
out
one
of
the
dell-holes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
Henry
was
out
to
enjoy
this
,
''
said
Helen
.
``
This
*NL*
lovely
weather
and
to
be
shut
up
in
the
house
!
It
's
very
hard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
has
to
be
,
''
said
Margaret
.
``
The
hay-fever
is
his
*NL*
chief
objection
against
living
here
,
but
he
thinks
it
worth
while
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Meg
,
is
or
is
n't
he
ill
?
I
ca
n't
make
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
ill
.
Eternally
tired
.
He
has
worked
very
hard
all
*NL*
his
life
,
and
noticed
nothing
.
Those
are
the
people
who
*NL*
collapse
when
they
do
notice
a
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
he
worries
dreadfully
about
his
part
of
the
tangle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dreadfully
.
That
is
why
I
wish
Dolly
had
not
come
,
*NL*
too
,
today
.
Still
,
he
wanted
them
all
to
come
.
It
has
to
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
does
he
want
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
did
not
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Meg
,
may
I
tell
you
something
?
I
like
Henry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
be
odd
if
you
did
n't
,
''
said
Margaret
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
use
n't
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Use
n't
!
''
She
lowered
her
eyes
a
moment
to
the
black
*NL*
abyss
of
the
past
.
They
had
crossed
it
,
always
excepting
*NL*
Leonard
and
Charles
.
They
were
building
up
a
new
life
,
*NL*
obscure
,
yet
gilded
with
tranquillity
.
Leonard
was
dead
;
*NL*
Charles
had
two
years
more
in
prison
.
One
use
n't
always
to
*NL*
see
clearly
before
that
time
.
It
was
different
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
Henry
because
he
does
worry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
he
likes
you
because
you
do
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Helen
sighed
.
She
seemed
humiliated
,
and
buried
her
*NL*
face
in
her
hands
.
After
a
time
she
said
:
``
Above
love
,
''
a
*NL*
transition
less
abrupt
than
it
appeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
never
stopped
working
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
a
woman
's
love
for
a
man
.
I
supposed
I
should
*NL*
hang
my
life
on
to
that
once
,
and
was
driven
up
and
down
and
*NL*
about
as
if
something
was
worrying
through
me
.
But
*NL*
everything
is
peaceful
now
;
I
seem
cured
.
That
Herr
*NL*
Forstmeister
,
whom
Frieda
keeps
writing
about
,
must
be
a
*NL*
noble
character
,
but
he
does
n't
see
that
I
shall
never
marry
*NL*
him
or
anyone
.
It
is
n't
shame
or
mistrust
of
myself
.
I
*NL*
simply
could
n't
.
I
'm
ended
.
I
used
to
be
so
dreamy
about
a
*NL*
man
's
love
as
a
girl
,
and
think
that
for
good
or
evil
love
*NL*
must
be
the
great
thing
.
But
it
has
n't
been
;
it
has
been
*NL*
itself
a
dream
.
Do
you
agree
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
agree
.
I
do
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ought
to
remember
Leonard
as
my
lover
,
''
said
Helen
,
*NL*
stepping
down
into
the
field
.
``
I
tempted
him
,
and
killed
*NL*
him
and
it
is
surely
the
least
I
can
do
.
I
would
like
to
*NL*
throw
out
all
my
heart
to
Leonard
on
such
an
afternoon
as
*NL*
this
.
But
I
can
not
.
It
is
no
good
pretending
.
I
am
*NL*
forgetting
him

Her
eyes
filled
with
tears
.
``
How
nothing
*NL*
seems
to
match
--
how
,
my
darling
,
my
precious
--
''
She
broke
*NL*
off
.
``
Tommy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
please
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Baby
's
not
to
try
and
stand
.

There
's
something
wanting
*NL*
in
me
.
I
see
you
loving
Henry
,
and
understanding
him
better
*NL*
daily
,
and
I
know
that
death
would
n't
part
you
in
the
*NL*
least
.
But
I
--
Is
it
some
awful
appalling
,
criminal
defect
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
silenced
her
.
She
said
:
``
It
is
only
that
*NL*
people
are
far
more
different
than
is
pretended
.
All
over
*NL*
the
world
men
and
women
are
worrying
because
they
can
not
*NL*
develop
as
they
are
supposed
to
develop
.
Here
and
there
*NL*
they
have
the
matter
out
,
and
it
comforts
them
.
Do
n't
fret
*NL*
yourself
,
Helen
.
Develop
what
you
have
;
love
your
child
.
I
*NL*
do
not
love
children
.
I
am
thankful
to
have
none
.
I
can
*NL*
play
with
their
beauty
and
charm
,
but
that
is
all
--
nothing
*NL*
real
,
not
one
scrap
of
what
there
ought
to
be
.
And
*NL*
others
--
others
go
farther
still
,
and
move
outside
humanity
*NL*
altogether
.
A
place
,
as
well
as
a
person
,
may
catch
the
*NL*
glow
.
Do
n't
you
see
that
all
this
leads
to
comfort
in
the
*NL*
end
?
It
is
part
of
the
battle
against
sameness
.
*NL*
Differences
--
eternal
differences
,
planted
by
God
in
a
single
*NL*
family
,
so
that
there
may
always
be
colour
;
sorrow
perhaps
,
*NL*
but
colour
in
the
daily
grey
.
Then
I
ca
n't
have
you
*NL*
worrying
about
Leonard
.
Do
n't
drag
in
the
personal
when
it
*NL*
will
not
come
.
Forget
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
but
what
has
Leonard
got
out
of
life
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
an
adventure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
enough
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
for
us
.
But
for
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Helen
took
up
a
bunch
of
grass
.
She
looked
at
the
*NL*
sorrel
,
and
the
red
and
white
and
yellow
clover
,
and
the
*NL*
quaker
grass
,
and
the
daisies
,
and
the
bents
that
composed
*NL*
it
.
She
raised
it
to
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
sweetening
yet
?
''
asked
Margaret
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
only
withered
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
sweeten
tomorrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Helen
smiled
.
``
Oh
,
Meg
,
you
are
a
person
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
``
Think
of
the
racket
and
torture
this
time
last
year
.
But
*NL*
now
I
could
n't
stop
unhappy
if
I
tried
.
What
a
change
--
and
*NL*
all
through
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
we
merely
settled
down
.
You
and
Henry
learnt
to
*NL*
understand
one
another
and
to
forgive
,
all
through
the
*NL*
autumn
and
the
winter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
who
settled
us
down
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
did
not
reply
.
The
scything
had
begun
,
and
she
*NL*
took
off
her
pince-nez
to
watch
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
!
''
cried
Helen
.
``
You
did
it
all
,
sweetest
,
though
*NL*
you
're
too
stupid
to
see
.
Living
here
was
your
plan
--
I
*NL*
wanted
you
;
he
wanted
you
;
and
every
one
said
it
was
*NL*
impossible
,
but
you
knew
.
Just
think
of
our
lives
without
*NL*
you
,
Meg
--
I
and
baby
with
Monica
,
revolting
by
theory
,
he
*NL*
handed
about
from
Dolly
to
Evie
.
But
you
picked
up
the
*NL*
pieces
,
and
made
us
a
home
.
Ca
n't
it
strike
you
--
even
for
a
*NL*
moment
--
that
your
life
has
been
heroic
?
Ca
n't
you
remember
*NL*
the
two
months
after
Charles
's
arrest
,
when
you
began
to
*NL*
act
,
and
did
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
both
ill
at
the
time
,
''
said
Margaret
.
``
I
did
*NL*
the
obvious
things
.
I
had
two
invalids
to
nurse
.
Here
was
*NL*
a
house
,
ready
furnished
and
empty
.
It
was
obvious
.
I
*NL*
did
n't
know
myself
it
would
turn
into
a
permanent
home
.
No
*NL*
doubt
I
have
done
a
little
towards
straightening
the
tangle
,
*NL*
but
things
that
I
ca
n't
phrase
have
helped
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
it
will
be
permanent
,
''
said
Helen
,
drifting
away
*NL*
to
other
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
so
.
There
are
moments
when
I
feel
Howards
End
*NL*
peculiarly
our
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
the
same
,
London
's
creeping
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
pointed
over
the
meadow
--
over
eight
or
nine
meadows
,
*NL*
but
at
the
end
of
them
was
a
red
rust
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
that
in
Surrey
and
even
Hampshire
now
,
''
she
*NL*
continued
.
``
I
can
see
it
from
the
Purbeck
Downs
.
And
*NL*
London
is
only
part
of
something
else
,
I
'm
afraid
.
Life
's
*NL*
going
to
be
melted
down
,
all
over
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
knew
that
her
sister
spoke
truly
.
Howards
End
,
*NL*
Oniton
,
the
Purbeck
Downs
,
the
Oderberge
,
were
all
*NL*
survivals
,
and
the
melting-pot
was
being
prepared
for
them
.
*NL*
Logically
,
they
had
no
right
to
be
alive
.
One
's
hope
was
in
*NL*
the
weakness
of
logic
.
Were
they
possibly
the
earth
beating
*NL*
time
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
a
thing
is
going
strong
now
,
it
need
not
go
*NL*
strong
for
ever
,
''
she
said
.
``
This
craze
for
motion
has
only
*NL*
set
in
during
the
last
hundred
years
.
It
may
be
followed
by
*NL*
a
civilization
that
wo
n't
be
a
movement
,
because
it
will
*NL*
rest
on
the
earth
.
All
the
signs
are
against
it
now
,
but
I
*NL*
ca
n't
help
hoping
,
and
very
early
in
the
morning
in
the
*NL*
garden
I
feel
that
our
house
is
the
future
as
well
as
the
past
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
turned
and
looked
at
it
.
Their
own
memories
*NL*
coloured
it
now
,
for
Helen
's
child
had
been
born
in
the
*NL*
central
room
of
the
nine
.
Then
Margaret
said
,
``
Oh
,
take
*NL*
care
--
!
''
for
something
moved
behind
the
window
of
the
hall
,
*NL*
and
the
door
opened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
conclave
's
breaking
at
last
.
I
'll
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
Helen
retreated
with
the
children
far
into
the
field
.
*NL*
Friendly
voices
greeted
her
.
Margaret
rose
,
to
encounter
a
*NL*
man
with
a
heavy
black
moustache
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
father
has
asked
for
you
,
''
he
said
with
hostility
.
*NL*
She
took
her
work
and
followed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
been
talking
business
,
''
he
continued
,
``
but
I
*NL*
dare
say
you
knew
all
about
it
beforehand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Clumsy
of
movement
--
for
he
had
spent
all
his
life
in
the
*NL*
saddle
--
Paul
drove
his
foot
against
the
paint
of
the
front
*NL*
door
.
Mrs.
Wilcox
gave
a
little
cry
of
annoyance
.
She
did
*NL*
not
like
anything
scratched
;
she
stopped
in
the
hall
to
take
*NL*
Dolly
's
boa
and
gloves
out
of
a
vase
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
husband
was
lying
in
a
great
leather
chair
in
the
*NL*
dining-room
,
and
by
his
side
,
holding
his
hand
rather
*NL*
ostentatiously
,
was
Evie
.
Dolly
,
dressed
in
purple
,
sat
*NL*
near
the
window
.
The
room
was
a
little
dark
and
airless
;
*NL*
they
were
obliged
to
keep
it
like
this
until
the
carting
of
*NL*
the
hay
.
Margaret
joined
the
family
without
speaking
;
the
*NL*
five
of
them
had
met
already
at
tea
,
and
she
knew
quite
well
*NL*
what
was
going
to
be
said
.
Averse
to
wasting
her
time
,
she
*NL*
went
on
sewing
.
The
clock
struck
six
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
this
going
to
suit
every
one
?
''
said
Henry
in
a
weary
*NL*
voice
.
He
used
the
old
phrases
,
but
their
effect
was
*NL*
unexpected
and
shadowy
.
``
Because
I
do
n't
want
you
all
*NL*
coming
here
later
on
and
complaining
that
I
have
been
unfair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
apparently
got
to
suit
us
,
''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
my
boy
.
You
have
only
to
speak
,
and
*NL*
I
will
leave
the
house
to
you
instead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
frowned
ill-temperedly
,
and
began
scratching
at
his
*NL*
arm
.
``
As
I
've
given
up
the
outdoor
life
that
suited
me
,
and
*NL*
I
have
come
home
to
look
after
the
business
,
it
's
no
good
my
*NL*
settling
down
here
,
''
he
said
at
last
.
``
It
's
not
really
the
*NL*
country
,
and
it
's
not
the
town
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
.
Does
my
arrangement
suit
you
,
Evie
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
Father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
,
Dolly
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dolly
raised
her
faded
little
face
,
which
sorrow
could
*NL*
wither
but
not
steady
.
``
Perfectly
splendidly
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
``
I
thought
Charles
wanted
it
for
the
boys
,
but
last
time
I
*NL*
saw
him
he
said
no
,
because
we
can
not
possibly
live
in
this
*NL*
part
of
England
again
.
Charles
says
we
ought
to
change
our
*NL*
name
,
but
I
can
not
think
what
to
,
for
Wilcox
just
suits
*NL*
Charles
and
me
,
and
I
ca
n't
think
of
any
other
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
general
silence
.
Dolly
looked
nervously
*NL*
round
,
fearing
that
she
had
been
inappropriate
.
Paul
*NL*
continued
to
scratch
his
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
leave
Howards
End
to
my
wife
absolutely
,
''
said
*NL*
Henry
.
``
And
let
every
one
understand
that
;
and
after
I
am
*NL*
dead
let
there
be
no
jealousy
and
no
surprise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
did
not
answer
.
There
was
something
uncanny
in
*NL*
her
triumph
.
She
,
who
had
never
expected
to
conquer
anyone
,
*NL*
had
charged
straight
through
these
Wilcoxes
and
broken
up
*NL*
their
lives
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
consequence
,
I
leave
my
wife
no
money
,
''
said
Henry
.
*NL*
``
That
is
her
own
wish
.
All
that
she
would
have
had
will
be
*NL*
divided
among
you
.
I
am
also
giving
you
a
great
deal
in
my
*NL*
lifetime
,
so
that
you
may
be
independent
of
me

That
is
her
*NL*
wish
,
too
.
She
also
is
giving
away
a
great
deal
of
money
.
*NL*
She
intends
to
diminish
her
income
by
half
during
the
next
*NL*
ten
years
;
she
intends
when
she
dies
to
leave
the
house
to
*NL*
her
--
to
her
nephew
,
down
in
the
field
.
Is
all
that
clear
?
*NL*
Does
every
one
understand
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
rose
to
his
feet
.
He
was
accustomed
to
natives
,
*NL*
and
a
very
little
shook
him
out
of
the
Englishman
.
Feeling
*NL*
manly
and
cynical
,
he
said
:
``
Down
in
the
field
?
Oh
,
come
!
*NL*
I
think
we
might
have
had
the
whole
establishment
,
*NL*
piccaninnies
included
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Cahill
whispered
:
``
Do
n't
,
Paul
.
You
promised
you
'd
*NL*
take
care
.
''
Feeling
a
woman
of
the
world
,
she
rose
and
*NL*
prepared
to
take
her
leave
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
father
kissed
her
.
``
Good-bye
,
old
girl
,
''
he
said
;
*NL*
``
do
n't
you
worry
about
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye

Dad

''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
it
was
Dolly
's
turn
.
Anxious
to
contribute
,
she
*NL*
laughed
nervously
,
and
said
:
``
Good-bye
,
Mr.
Wilcox
.
It
does
*NL*
seem
curious
that
Mrs.
Wilcox
should
have
left
Margaret

Howards
End
,
and
yet
she
get
it
,
after
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
From
Evie
came
a
sharply-drawn
breath
.
``
Good-bye
,
''
she
*NL*
said
to
Margaret
,
and
kissed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
again
and
again
fell
the
word
,
like
the
ebb
of
a
*NL*
dying
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye

*NL*
*NL*
``
So
long

*NL*
``
Good-bye

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye

*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
saw
their
visitors
to
the
gate
.
Then
she
*NL*
returned
to
her
husband
and
laid
her
head
in
his
hands
.
He
*NL*
was
pitiably
tired
.
But
Dolly
's
remark
had
interested
her
.
*NL*
At
last
she
said
:
``
Could
you
tell
me
,
Henry
,
what
was
that
*NL*
about
Mrs.
Wilcox
having
left
me
Howards
End

''
*NL*
*NL*
Tranquilly
he
replied
:
``
Yes
,
she
did
.
But
that
is
a
*NL*
very
old
story

When
she
was
ill
and
you
were
so
kind
to
*NL*
her
she
wanted
to
make
you
some
return
,
and
,
not
being
*NL*
herself
at
the
time
,
scribbled
`
Howards
End
'
on
a
piece
of
*NL*
paper
.
I
went
into
it
thoroughly
,
and
,
as
it
was
clearly
*NL*
fanciful
,
I
set
it
aside
,
little
knowing
what
my
Margaret
*NL*
would
be
to
me
in
the
future

''
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
was
silent
.
Something
shook
her
life
in
its
*NL*
inmost
recesses
,
and
she
shivered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
do
wrong

did
I
