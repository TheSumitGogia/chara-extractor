EXPLANATORY
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
book
a
number
of
dialects
are
used
,
to
wit
:
the
Missouri
negro
*NL*
dialect
;
the
extremest
form
of
the
backwoods
Southwestern
dialect
;
the
*NL*
ordinary
``
Pike
County
''
dialect
;
and
four
modified
varieties
of
this
*NL*
last
.
The
shadings
have
not
been
done
in
a
haphazard
fashion
,
or
by
*NL*
guesswork
;
but
painstakingly
,
and
with
the
trustworthy
guidance
and
*NL*
support
of
personal
familiarity
with
these
several
forms
of
speech
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
make
this
explanation
for
the
reason
that
without
it
many
readers
*NL*
would
suppose
that
all
these
characters
were
trying
to
talk
alike
and
*NL*
not
succeeding
.

CHAPTER
I
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
You
do
n't
know
about
me
without
you
have
read
a
book
by
the
name
of
*NL*
_
The
Adventures
of
Tom
Sawyer
;
_
but
that
ai
n't
no
matter
.
That
book
*NL*
was
made
by
Mr.
Mark
Twain
,
and
he
told
the
truth
,
mainly
.
There
was
*NL*
things
which
he
stretched
,
but
mainly
he
told
the
truth
.
That
is
*NL*
nothing
.
I
never
seen
anybody
but
lied
one
time
or
another
,
without
it
*NL*
was
Aunt
Polly
,
or
the
widow
,
or
maybe
Mary
.
Aunt
Polly
--
Tom
's
Aunt
*NL*
Polly
,
she
is
--
and
Mary
,
and
the
Widow
Douglas
is
all
told
about
in
*NL*
that
book
,
which
is
mostly
a
true
book
,
with
some
stretchers
,
as
I
*NL*
said
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
the
way
that
the
book
winds
up
is
this
:
Tom
and
me
found
the
money
*NL*
that
the
robbers
hid
in
the
cave
,
and
it
made
us
rich
.
We
got
six
*NL*
thousand
dollars
apiece
--
all
gold
.
It
was
an
awful
sight
of
money
when
*NL*
it
was
piled
up
.
Well
,
Judge
Thatcher
he
took
it
and
put
it
out
at
*NL*
interest
,
and
it
fetched
us
a
dollar
a
day
apiece
all
the
year
*NL*
round
--
more
than
a
body
could
tell
what
to
do
with
.
The
Widow
Douglas
*NL*
she
took
me
for
her
son
,
and
allowed
she
would
sivilize
me
;
but
it
was
*NL*
rough
living
in
the
house
all
the
time
,
considering
how
dismal
regular
*NL*
and
decent
the
widow
was
in
all
her
ways
;
and
so
when
I
could
n't
stand
*NL*
it
no
longer
I
lit
out
.
I
got
into
my
old
rags
and
my
sugar-hogshead
*NL*
again
,
and
was
free
and
satisfied
.
But
Tom
Sawyer
he
hunted
me
up
and
*NL*
said
he
was
going
to
start
a
band
of
robbers
,
and
I
might
join
if
I
*NL*
would
go
back
to
the
widow
and
be
respectable
.
So
I
went
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
widow
she
cried
over
me
,
and
called
me
a
poor
lost
lamb
,
and
she
*NL*
called
me
a
lot
of
other
names
,
too
,
but
she
never
meant
no
harm
by
*NL*
it
.
She
put
me
in
them
new
clothes
again
,
and
I
could
n't
do
nothing
*NL*
but
sweat
and
sweat
,
and
feel
all
cramped
up
.
Well
,
then
,
the
old
*NL*
thing
commenced
again
.
The
widow
rung
a
bell
for
supper
,
and
you
had
*NL*
to
come
to
time
.
When
you
got
to
the
table
you
could
n't
go
right
to
*NL*
eating
,
but
you
had
to
wait
for
the
widow
to
tuck
down
her
head
and
*NL*
grumble
a
little
over
the
victuals
,
though
there
war
n't
really
*NL*
anything
the
matter
with
them
--
that
is
,
nothing
only
everything
was
*NL*
cooked
by
itself
.
In
a
barrel
of
odds
and
ends
it
is
different
;
things
*NL*
get
mixed
up
,
and
the
juice
kind
of
swaps
around
,
and
the
things
go
*NL*
better
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
supper
she
got
out
her
book
and
learned
me
about
Moses
and
the
*NL*
Bulrushers
,
and
I
was
in
a
sweat
to
find
out
all
about
him
;
but
by
and
*NL*
by
she
let
it
out
that
Moses
had
been
dead
a
considerable
long
time
;
*NL*
so
then
I
did
n't
care
no
more
about
him
,
because
I
do
n't
take
no
stock
*NL*
in
dead
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pretty
soon
I
wanted
to
smoke
,
and
asked
the
widow
to
let
me
.
But
she
*NL*
would
n't
.
She
said
it
was
a
mean
practice
and
was
n't
clean
,
and
I
must
*NL*
try
to
not
do
it
any
more
.
That
is
just
the
way
with
some
people
.
They
*NL*
get
down
on
a
thing
when
they
do
n't
know
nothing
about
it
.
Here
she
*NL*
was
a-bothering
about
Moses
,
which
was
no
kin
to
her
,
and
no
use
to
*NL*
anybody
,
being
gone
,
you
see
,
yet
finding
a
power
of
fault
with
me
for
*NL*
doing
a
thing
that
had
some
good
in
it
.
And
she
took
snuff
,
too
;
of
*NL*
course
that
was
all
right
,
because
she
done
it
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
sister
,
Miss
Watson
,
a
tolerable
slim
old
maid
,
with
goggles
on
,
*NL*
had
just
come
to
live
with
her
,
and
took
a
set
at
me
now
with
a
*NL*
spelling-book
.
She
worked
me
middling
hard
for
about
an
hour
,
and
then
*NL*
the
widow
made
her
ease
up
.
I
could
n't
stood
it
much
longer
.
Then
for
*NL*
an
hour
it
was
deadly
dull
,
and
I
was
fidgety
.
Miss
Watson
would
say
,
*NL*
``
Do
n't
put
your
feet
up
there
,
Huckleberry
''
;
and
``
Do
n't
scrunch
up
*NL*
like
that
,
Huckleberry
--
set
up
straight
''
;
and
pretty
soon
she
would
*NL*
say
,
``
Do
n't
gap
and
stretch
like
that
,
Huckleberry
--
why
do
n't
you
try
*NL*
to
behave
?
''
Then
she
told
me
all
about
the
bad
place
,
and
I
said
I
*NL*
wished
I
was
there
.
She
got
mad
then
,
but
I
did
n't
mean
no
harm
.
All
I
*NL*
wanted
was
to
go
somewheres
;
all
I
wanted
was
a
change
,
I
war
n't
*NL*
particular
.
She
said
it
was
wicked
to
say
what
I
said
;
said
she
*NL*
would
n't
say
it
for
the
whole
world
;
she
was
going
to
live
so
as
to
go
*NL*
to
the
good
place
.
Well
,
I
could
n't
see
no
advantage
in
going
where
*NL*
she
was
going
,
so
I
made
up
my
mind
I
would
n't
try
for
it
.
But
I
never
*NL*
said
so
,
because
it
would
only
make
trouble
,
and
would
n't
do
no
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
she
had
got
a
start
,
and
she
went
on
and
told
me
all
about
the
*NL*
good
place
.
She
said
all
a
body
would
have
to
do
there
was
to
go
*NL*
around
all
day
long
with
a
harp
and
sing
,
forever
and
ever
.
So
I
*NL*
did
n't
think
much
of
it
.
But
I
never
said
so
.
I
asked
her
if
she
*NL*
reckoned
Tom
Sawyer
would
go
there
,
and
she
said
not
by
a
considerable
*NL*
sight
.
I
was
glad
about
that
,
because
I
wanted
him
and
me
to
be
*NL*
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Watson
she
kept
pecking
at
me
,
and
it
got
tiresome
and
lonesome
.
*NL*
By
and
by
they
fetched
the
niggers
in
and
had
prayers
,
and
then
*NL*
everybody
was
off
to
bed
.
I
went
up
to
my
room
with
a
piece
of
candle
,
*NL*
and
put
it
on
the
table
.
Then
I
set
down
in
a
chair
by
the
window
and
*NL*
tried
to
think
of
something
cheerful
,
but
it
war
n't
no
use
.
I
felt
so
*NL*
lonesome
I
most
wished
I
was
dead
.
The
stars
were
shining
,
and
the
*NL*
leaves
rustled
in
the
woods
ever
so
mournful
;
and
I
heard
an
owl
,
away
*NL*
off
,
who-whooing
about
somebody
that
was
dead
,
and
a
whippowill
and
a
*NL*
dog
crying
about
somebody
that
was
going
to
die
;
and
the
wind
was
*NL*
trying
to
whisper
something
to
me
,
and
I
could
n't
make
out
what
it
*NL*
was
,
and
so
it
made
the
cold
shivers
run
over
me
.
Then
away
out
in
the
*NL*
woods
I
heard
that
kind
of
a
sound
that
a
ghost
makes
when
it
wants
to
*NL*
tell
about
something
that
's
on
its
mind
and
ca
n't
make
itself
*NL*
understood
,
and
so
ca
n't
rest
easy
in
its
grave
,
and
has
to
go
about
*NL*
that
way
every
night
grieving
.
I
got
so
downhearted
and
scared
I
did
*NL*
wish
I
had
some
company
.
Pretty
soon
a
spider
went
crawling
up
my
*NL*
shoulder
,
and
I
flipped
it
off
and
it
lit
in
the
candle
;
and
before
I
*NL*
could
budge
it
was
all
shriveled
up
.
I
did
n't
need
anybody
to
tell
me
*NL*
that
that
was
an
awful
bad
sign
and
would
fetch
me
some
bad
luck
,
so
I
*NL*
was
scared
and
most
shook
the
clothes
off
of
me
.
I
got
up
and
turned
*NL*
around
in
my
tracks
three
times
and
crossed
my
breast
every
time
;
and
*NL*
then
I
tied
up
a
little
lock
of
my
hair
with
a
thread
to
keep
witches
*NL*
away
.
But
I
had
n't
no
confidence
.
You
do
that
when
you
've
lost
a
*NL*
horseshoe
that
you
've
found
,
instead
of
nailing
it
up
over
the
door
,
*NL*
but
I
had
n't
ever
heard
anybody
say
it
was
any
way
to
keep
off
bad
*NL*
luck
when
you
'd
killed
a
spider
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
set
down
again
,
a-shaking
all
over
,
and
got
out
my
pipe
for
a
smoke
;
*NL*
for
the
house
was
all
as
still
as
death
now
,
and
so
the
widow
would
n't
*NL*
know
.
Well
,
after
a
long
time
I
heard
the
clock
away
off
in
the
town
*NL*
go
boom
--
boom
--
boom
--
twelve
licks
;
and
all
still
again
--
stiller
than
*NL*
ever
.
Pretty
soon
I
heard
a
twig
snap
down
in
the
dark
amongst
the
*NL*
trees
--
something
was
a-stirring
.
I
set
still
and
listened
.
Directly
I
*NL*
could
just
barely
hear
a
``
me-yow
!
me-yow
!
''
down
there
.
That
was
good
!
*NL*
Says
I
,
``
me-yow
!
me-yow
!
''
as
soft
as
I
could
,
and
then
I
put
out
the
*NL*
light
and
scrambled
out
of
the
window
on
to
the
shed
.
Then
I
slipped
*NL*
down
to
the
ground
and
crawled
in
among
the
trees
,
and
,
sure
enough
,
*NL*
there
was
Tom
Sawyer
waiting
for
me
.
*NL*

CHAPTER
II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
We
went
tiptoeing
along
a
path
amongst
the
trees
back
toward
the
end
*NL*
of
the
widow
's
garden
,
stooping
down
so
as
the
branches
would
n't
*NL*
scrape
our
heads
.
When
we
was
passing
by
the
kitchen
I
fell
over
a
*NL*
root
and
made
a
noise
.
We
scrouched
down
and
laid
still
.
Miss
Watson
's
*NL*
big
nigger
,
named
Jim
,
was
setting
in
the
kitchen
door
;
we
could
see
*NL*
him
pretty
clear
,
because
there
was
a
light
behind
him
.
He
got
up
and
*NL*
stretched
his
neck
out
about
a
minute
,
listening
.
Then
he
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
dah
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
listened
some
more
;
then
he
came
tiptoeing
down
and
stood
right
*NL*
between
us
;
we
could
`
a
'
touched
him
,
nearly
.
Well
,
likely
it
was
*NL*
minutes
and
minutes
that
there
war
n't
a
sound
,
and
we
all
there
so
*NL*
close
together
.
There
was
a
place
on
my
ankle
that
got
to
itching
,
but
*NL*
I
das
n't
scratch
it
;
and
then
my
ear
begun
to
itch
;
and
next
my
back
,
*NL*
right
between
my
shoulders
.
Seemed
like
I
'd
die
if
I
could
n't
scratch
.
*NL*
Well
,
I
've
noticed
that
thing
plenty
times
since
.
If
you
are
with
the
*NL*
quality
,
or
at
a
funeral
,
or
trying
to
go
to
sleep
when
you
ai
n't
*NL*
sleepy
--
if
you
are
anywheres
where
it
wo
n't
do
for
you
to
scratch
,
why
*NL*
you
will
itch
all
over
in
upward
of
a
thousand
places
.
Pretty
soon
Jim
*NL*
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
who
is
you
?
Whar
is
you
?
Dog
my
cats
ef
I
didn
'
hear
sumf
`
n.
*NL*
Well
,
I
know
what
I
's
gwyne
to
do
:
I
's
gwyne
to
set
down
here
and
*NL*
listen
tell
I
hears
it
ag
`
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
set
down
on
the
ground
betwixt
me
and
Tom
.
He
leaned
his
back
up
*NL*
against
a
tree
,
and
stretched
his
legs
out
till
one
of
them
most
*NL*
touched
one
of
mine
.
My
nose
begun
to
itch
.
It
itched
till
the
tears
*NL*
come
into
my
eyes
.
But
I
das
n't
scratch
.
Then
it
begun
to
itch
on
the
*NL*
inside
.
Next
I
got
to
itching
underneath
.
I
did
n't
know
how
I
was
*NL*
going
to
set
still
.
This
miserableness
went
on
as
much
as
six
or
seven
*NL*
minutes
;
but
it
seemed
a
sight
longer
than
that
.
I
was
itching
in
*NL*
eleven
different
places
now
.
I
reckoned
I
could
n't
stand
it
more
'n
a
*NL*
minute
longer
,
but
I
set
my
teeth
hard
and
got
ready
to
try
.
Just
then
*NL*
Jim
begun
to
breathe
heavy
;
next
he
begun
to
snore
--
and
then
I
was
*NL*
pretty
soon
comfortable
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
he
made
a
sign
to
me
--
kind
of
a
little
noise
with
his
mouth
--
and
*NL*
we
went
creeping
away
on
our
hands
and
knees
.
When
we
was
ten
foot
off
*NL*
Tom
whispered
to
me
,
and
wanted
to
tie
Jim
to
the
tree
for
fun
.
But
I
*NL*
said
no
;
he
might
wake
and
make
a
disturbance
,
and
then
they
'd
find
*NL*
out
I
war
n't
in
.
Then
Tom
said
he
had
n't
got
candles
enough
,
and
he
*NL*
would
slip
in
the
kitchen
and
get
some
more
.
I
did
n't
want
him
to
try
.
*NL*
I
said
Jim
might
wake
up
and
come
.
But
Tom
wanted
to
resk
it
;
so
we
*NL*
slid
in
there
and
got
three
candles
,
and
Tom
laid
five
cents
on
the
*NL*
table
for
pay
.
Then
we
got
out
,
and
I
was
in
a
sweat
to
get
away
;
but
*NL*
nothing
would
do
Tom
but
he
must
crawl
to
where
Jim
was
,
on
his
hands
*NL*
and
knees
,
and
play
something
on
him
.
I
waited
,
and
it
seemed
a
good
*NL*
while
,
everything
was
so
still
and
lonesome
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
Tom
was
back
we
cut
along
the
path
,
around
the
garden
*NL*
fence
,
and
by
and
by
fetched
up
on
the
steep
top
of
the
hill
the
other
*NL*
side
of
the
house
.
Tom
said
he
slipped
Jim
's
hat
off
of
his
head
and
*NL*
hung
it
on
a
limb
right
over
him
,
and
Jim
stirred
a
little
,
but
he
*NL*
did
n't
wake
.
Afterward
Jim
said
the
witches
bewitched
him
and
put
him
*NL*
in
a
trance
,
and
rode
him
all
over
the
state
,
and
then
set
him
under
*NL*
the
trees
again
,
and
hung
his
hat
on
a
limb
to
show
who
done
it
.
And
*NL*
next
time
Jim
told
it
he
said
they
rode
him
down
to
New
Orleans
;
and
,
*NL*
after
that
,
every
time
he
told
it
he
spread
it
more
and
more
,
till
by
*NL*
and
by
he
said
they
rode
him
all
over
the
world
,
and
tired
him
most
to
*NL*
death
,
and
his
back
was
all
over
saddle-boils
.
Jim
was
monstrous
proud
*NL*
about
it
,
and
he
got
so
he
would
n't
hardly
notice
the
other
niggers
.
*NL*
Niggers
would
come
miles
to
hear
Jim
tell
about
it
,
and
he
was
more
*NL*
looked
up
to
than
any
nigger
in
that
country
.
Strange
niggers
would
*NL*
stand
with
their
mouths
open
and
look
him
all
over
,
same
as
if
he
was
*NL*
a
wonder
.
Niggers
is
always
talking
about
witches
in
the
dark
by
the
*NL*
kitchen
fire
;
but
whenever
one
was
talking
and
letting
on
to
know
all
*NL*
about
such
things
,
Jim
would
happen
in
and
say
,
``
Hm
!
What
you
know
*NL*
`
bout
witches
?
''
and
that
nigger
was
corked
up
and
had
to
take
a
back
*NL*
seat
.
Jim
always
kept
that
five-center
piece
round
his
neck
with
a
*NL*
string
,
and
said
it
was
a
charm
the
devil
give
to
him
with
his
own
*NL*
hands
,
and
told
him
he
could
cure
anybody
with
it
and
fetch
witches
*NL*
whenever
he
wanted
to
just
by
saying
something
to
it
;
but
he
never
*NL*
told
what
it
was
he
said
to
it
.
Niggers
would
come
from
all
around
*NL*
there
and
give
Jim
anything
they
had
,
just
for
a
sight
of
that
*NL*
five-center
piece
;
but
they
would
n't
touch
it
,
because
the
devil
had
*NL*
had
his
hands
on
it
.
Jim
was
most
ruined
for
a
servant
,
because
he
got
*NL*
stuck
up
on
account
of
having
seen
the
devil
and
been
rode
by
witches
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
when
Tom
and
me
got
to
the
edge
of
the
hilltop
we
looked
away
*NL*
down
into
the
village
and
could
see
three
or
four
lights
twinkling
,
*NL*
where
there
was
sick
folks
,
maybe
;
and
the
stars
over
us
was
sparkling
*NL*
ever
so
fine
;
and
down
by
the
village
was
the
river
,
a
whole
mile
*NL*
broad
,
and
awful
still
and
grand
.
We
went
down
the
hill
and
found
Joe
*NL*
Harper
and
Ben
Rogers
,
and
two
or
three
more
of
the
boys
,
hid
in
the
*NL*
old
tanyard
.
So
we
unhitched
a
skiff
and
pulled
down
the
river
two
*NL*
mile
and
a
half
,
to
the
big
scar
on
the
hillside
,
and
went
ashore
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
went
to
a
clump
of
bushes
,
and
Tom
made
everybody
swear
to
keep
the
*NL*
secret
,
and
then
showed
them
a
hole
in
the
hill
,
right
in
the
thickest
*NL*
part
of
the
bushes
.
Then
we
lit
the
candles
,
and
crawled
in
on
our
*NL*
hands
and
knees
.
We
went
about
two
hundred
yards
,
and
then
the
cave
*NL*
opened
up
.
Tom
poked
about
amongst
the
passages
,
and
pretty
soon
*NL*
ducked
under
a
wall
where
you
would
n't
`
a
'
noticed
that
there
was
a
*NL*
hole
.
We
went
along
a
narrow
place
and
got
into
a
kind
of
room
,
all
*NL*
damp
and
sweaty
and
cold
,
and
there
we
stopped
.
Tom
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
we
'll
start
this
band
of
robbers
and
call
it
Tom
Sawyer
's
Gang
.
*NL*
Everybody
that
wants
to
join
has
got
to
take
an
oath
,
and
write
his
*NL*
name
in
blood
.
''
Everybody
was
willing
.
So
Tom
got
out
a
sheet
of
paper
*NL*
that
he
had
wrote
the
oath
on
,
and
read
it
.
It
swore
every
boy
to
*NL*
stick
to
the
band
,
and
never
tell
any
of
the
secrets
;
and
if
anybody
*NL*
done
anything
to
any
boy
in
the
band
,
whichever
boy
was
ordered
to
*NL*
kill
that
person
and
his
family
must
do
it
,
and
he
must
n't
eat
and
he
*NL*
must
n't
sleep
till
he
had
killed
them
and
hacked
a
cross
in
their
*NL*
breasts
,
which
was
the
sign
of
the
band
.
And
nobody
that
did
n't
belong
*NL*
to
the
band
could
use
that
mark
,
and
if
he
did
he
must
be
sued
;
and
if
*NL*
he
done
it
again
he
must
be
killed
.
And
if
anybody
that
belonged
to
*NL*
the
band
told
the
secrets
,
he
must
have
his
throat
cut
,
and
then
have
*NL*
his
carcass
burnt
up
and
the
ashes
scattered
all
around
,
and
his
name
*NL*
blotted
off
the
list
with
blood
and
never
mentioned
again
by
the
gang
,
*NL*
but
have
a
curse
put
on
it
and
be
forgot
forever
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everybody
said
it
was
a
real
beautiful
oath
,
and
asked
Tom
if
he
got
*NL*
it
out
of
his
own
head
.
He
said
some
of
it
,
but
the
rest
was
out
of
*NL*
pirate-books
and
robber-books
,
and
every
gang
that
was
high-toned
had
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
thought
it
would
be
good
to
kill
the
_
families
_
of
boys
that
told
*NL*
the
secrets
.
Tom
said
it
was
a
good
idea
,
so
he
took
a
pencil
and
*NL*
wrote
it
in
.
Then
Ben
Rogers
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
's
Huck
Finn
,
he
hai
n't
got
no
family
;
what
you
going
to
do
`
bout
*NL*
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
hai
n't
he
got
a
father
?
''
says
Tom
Sawyer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
he
's
got
a
father
,
but
you
ca
n't
never
find
him
these
days
.
He
*NL*
used
to
lay
drunk
with
the
hogs
in
the
tanyard
,
but
he
hai
n't
been
*NL*
seen
in
these
parts
for
a
year
or
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
talked
it
over
,
and
they
was
going
to
rule
me
out
,
because
they
*NL*
said
every
boy
must
have
a
family
or
somebody
to
kill
,
or
else
it
*NL*
would
n't
be
fair
and
square
for
the
others
.
Well
,
nobody
could
think
*NL*
of
anything
to
do
--
everybody
was
stumped
,
and
set
still
.
I
was
most
*NL*
ready
to
cry
;
but
all
at
once
I
thought
of
a
way
,
and
so
I
offered
*NL*
them
Miss
Watson
--
they
could
kill
her
.
Everybody
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
she
'll
do
.
That
's
all
right
.
Huck
can
come
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
they
all
stuck
a
pin
in
their
fingers
to
get
blood
to
sign
with
,
*NL*
and
I
made
my
mark
on
the
paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
says
Ben
Rogers
,
``
what
's
the
line
of
business
of
this
Gang
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
only
robbery
and
murder
,
''
Tom
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
who
are
we
going
to
rob
?
--
houses
,
or
cattle
,
or
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stuff
!
stealing
cattle
and
such
things
ai
n't
robbery

it
's
burglary

''
*NL*
says
Tom
Sawyer
.
``
We
ai
n't
burglars

That
ai
n't
no

We

*NL*
*NL*
``
Must
we
always

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

certainly

It

*NL*
Little
Tommy
Barnes
was
asleep
now
,
and
when
they
waked
him
up
he
was
*NL*
scared
,
and
cried
,
and
said
he
wanted
to
go
home
to
his
ma
,
and
did
n't
*NL*
want
to
be
a
robber
any
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
they
all
made
fun
of
him
,
and
called
him
cry-baby
,
and
that
made
*NL*
him
mad
,
and
he
said
he
would
go
straight
and
tell
all
the
secrets
.
*NL*
But
Tom
give
him
five
cents
to
keep
quiet
,
and
said
we
would
all
go
*NL*
home
and
meet
next
week
,
and
rob
somebody
and
kill
some
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ben
Rogers
said
he
could
n't
get
out
much
,
only
Sundays
,
and
so
he
*NL*
wanted
to
begin
next
Sunday
;
but
all
the
boys
said
it
would
be
wicked
*NL*
to
do
it
on
Sunday
,
and
that
settled
the
thing
.
They
agreed
to
get
*NL*
together
and
fix
a
day
as
soon
as
they
could
,
and
then
we
elected
Tom
*NL*
Sawyer
first
captain
and
Joe
Harper
second
captain
of
the
Gang
,
and
so
*NL*
started
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
clumb
up
the
shed
and
crept
into
my
window
just
before
day
was
*NL*
breaking
.
My
new
clothes
was
all
greased
up

clayey

I
was

dog-tired

CHAPTER
III
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
I
got
a
good
going-over
in
the
morning
from
old
Miss
Watson
on
*NL*
account
of
my
clothes
;
but
the
widow
she
did
n't
scold
,
but
only
*NL*
cleaned
off
the
grease
and
clay
,
and
looked
so
sorry
that
I
thought
I
*NL*
would
behave
awhile
if
I
could
.
Then
Miss
Watson
she
took
me
in
the
*NL*
closet
and
prayed
,
but
nothing
come
of
it
.
She
told
me
to
pray
every
*NL*
day
,
and
whatever
I
asked
for
I
would
get
it
.
But
it
war
n't
so
.
I
*NL*
tried
it
.
Once
I
got
a
fish-line
,
but
no
hooks
.
It
war
n't
any
good
to
*NL*
me
without
hooks
.
I
tried
for
the
hooks
three
or
four
times
,
but
*NL*
somehow
I
could
n't
make
it
work
.
By
and
by
,
one
day
,
I
asked
Miss
*NL*
Watson
to
try
for
me
,
but
she
said
I
was
a
fool
.
She
never
told
me
*NL*
why
,
and
I
could
n't
make
it
out
no
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
set
down
one
time
back
in
the
woods
,
and
had
a
long
think
about
it
.
*NL*
I
says
to
myself
,
if
a
body
can
get
anything
they
pray
for
,
why
do
n't
*NL*
Deacon
Winn
get
back
the
money
he
lost
on
pork
?
Why
ca
n't
the
widow
*NL*
get
back
her
silver
snuff-box
that
was
stole
?
Why
ca
n't
Miss
Watson
*NL*
fat
up
?
No
,
says
I
to
myself
,
there
ai
n't
nothing
in
it
.
I
went
and
*NL*
told
the
widow
about
it
,
and
she
said
the
thing
a
body
could
get
by
*NL*
praying
for
it
was
``
spiritual
gifts
.
''
This
was
too
many
for
me
,
but
*NL*
she
told
me
what
she
meant
--
I
must
help
other
people
,
and
do
*NL*
everything
I
could
for
other
people
,
and
look
out
for
them
all
the
*NL*
time
,
and
never
think
about
myself
.
This
was
including
Miss
Watson
,
as
*NL*
I
took
it
.
I
went
out
in
the
woods
and
turned
it
over
in
my
mind
a
*NL*
long
time
,
but
I
could
n't
see
no
advantage
about
it
--
except
for
the
*NL*
other
people
;
so
at
last
I
reckoned
I
would
n't
worry
about
it
any
*NL*
more
,
but
just
let
it
go
.
Sometimes
the
widow
would
take
me
one
side
*NL*
and
talk
about
Providence
in
a
way
to
make
a
body
's
mouth
water
;
but
*NL*
maybe
next
day
Miss
Watson
would
take
hold
and
knock
it
all
down
*NL*
again
.
I
judged
I
could
see
that
there
was
two
Providences
,
and
a
poor
*NL*
chap
would
stand
considerable
show
with
the
widow
's
Providence
,
but
if
*NL*
Miss
Watson
's
got
him
there
war
n't
no
help
for
him
any
more
.
I
thought
*NL*
it
all
out
,
and
reckoned
I
would
belong
to
the
widow
's
if
he
wanted
*NL*
me
,
though
I
could
n't
make
out
how
he
was
a-going
to
be
any
better
off
*NL*
then
than
what
he
was
before
,
seeing
I
was
so
ignorant
,
and
so
kind
of
*NL*
low-down
and
ornery
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pap
he
had
n't
been
seen
for
more
than
a
year
,
and
that
was
comfortable
*NL*
for
me
;
I
did
n't
want
to
see
him
no
more
.
He
used
to
always
whale
me
*NL*
when
he
was
sober
and
could
get
his
hands
on
me
;
though
I
used
to
take
*NL*
to
the
woods
most
of
the
time
when
he
was
around
.
Well
,
about
this
*NL*
time
he
was
found
in
the
river
drownded
,
about
twelve
mile
above
town
,
*NL*
so
people
said
.
They
judged
it
was
him
,
anyway
;
said
this
drownded
man
*NL*
was
just
his
size
,
and
was
ragged
,
and
had
uncommon
long
hair
,
which
*NL*
was
all
like
pap
;
but
they
could
n't
make
nothing
out
of
the
face
,
*NL*
because
it
had
been
in
the
water
so
long
it
war
n't
much
like
a
face
at
*NL*
all
.
They
said
he
was
floating
on
his
back
in
the
water
.
They
took
him
*NL*
and
buried
him
on
the
bank
.
But
I
war
n't
comfortable
long
,
because
I
*NL*
happened
to
think
of
something
.
I
knowed
mighty
well
that
a
drownded
*NL*
man
do
n't
float
on
his
back
,
but
on
his
face
.
So
I
knowed
,
then
,
that
*NL*
this
war
n't
pap
,
but
a
woman
dressed
up
in
a
man
's
clothes
.
So
I
was
*NL*
uncomfortable
again
.
I
judged
the
old
man
would
turn
up
again
by
and
*NL*
by
,
though
I
wished
he
would
n't
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
played
robber
now
and
then
about
a
month
,
and
then
I
resigned
.
All
*NL*
the
boys
did
.
We
had
n't
robbed
nobody
,
had
n't
killed
any
people
,
but
*NL*
only
just
pretended
.
We
used
to
hop
out
of
the
woods
and
go
charging
*NL*
down
on
hog-drivers
and
women
in
carts
taking
garden
stuff
to
market
,
*NL*
but
we
never
hived
any
of
them
.
Tom
Sawyer
called
the
hogs
``
ingots
,
''
*NL*
and
he
called
the
turnips
and
stuff
``
julery
,
''
and
we
would
go
to
the
*NL*
cave
and
powwow
over
what
we
had
done
,
and
how
many
people
we
had
*NL*
killed
and
marked
.
But
I
could
n't
see
no
profit
in
it
.
One
time
Tom
*NL*
sent
a
boy
to
run
about
town
with
a
blazing
stick
,
which
he
called
a
*NL*
slogan
-LRB-
which
was
the
sign
for
the
Gang
to
get
together
-RRB-
,
and
then
he
*NL*
said
he
had
got
secret
news
by
his
spies
that
next
day
a
whole
parcel
*NL*
of
Spanish
merchants
and
rich
A-rabs
was
going
to
camp
in
Cave
Hollow
*NL*
with
two
hundred
elephants
,
and
six
hundred
camels
,
and
over
a
*NL*
thousand
``
sumter
''
mules
,
all
loaded
down
with
di
`
monds
,
and
they
*NL*
did
n't
have
only
a
guard
of
four
hundred
soldiers
,
and
so
we
would
lay
*NL*
in
ambuscade
,
as
he
called
it
,
and
kill
the
lot
and
scoop
the
things
.
*NL*
He
said
we
must
slick
up
our
swords
and
guns
,
and
get
ready
.
He
never
*NL*
could
go
after
even
a
turnip-cart
but
he
must
have
the
swords
and
guns
*NL*
all
scoured
up
for
it
,
though
they
was
only
lath
and
broomsticks
,
and
*NL*
you
might
scour
at
them
till
you
rotted
,
and
then
they
war
n't
worth
a
*NL*
mouthful
of
ashes
more
than
what
they
was
before
.
I
did
n't
believe
we
*NL*
could
lick
such
a
crowd
of
Spaniards
and
A-rabs
,
but
I
wanted
to
see
*NL*
the
camels
and
elephants
,
so
I
was
on
hand
next
day
,
Saturday
,
in
the
*NL*
ambuscade
;
and
when
we
got
the
word
we
rushed
out
of
the
woods
and
*NL*
down
the
hill
.
But
there
war
n't
no
Spaniards
and
A-rabs
,
and
there
*NL*
war
n't
no
camels
nor
no
elephants
.
It
war
n't
anything
but
a
*NL*
Sunday-school
picnic
,
and
only
a
primer
class
at
that
.
We
busted
it
*NL*
up
,
and
chased
the
children
up
the
hollow
;
but
we
never
got
anything
*NL*
but
some
doughnuts
and
jam
,
though
Ben
Rogers
got
a
rag
doll
,
and
Joe
*NL*
Harper
got
a
hymn-book
and
a
tract
;
and
then
the
teacher
charged
in
,
*NL*
and
made
us
drop
everything
and
cut
.
I
did
n't
see
no
di
`
monds
,
and
I
*NL*
told
Tom
Sawyer
so
.
He
said
there
was
loads
of
them
there
,
anyway
;
and
*NL*
he
said
there
was
A-rabs
there
,
too
,
and
elephants
and
things
.
I
said
,
*NL*
why
could
n't
we
see
them
,
then
?
He
said
if
I
war
n't
so
ignorant
,
but
*NL*
had
read
a
book
called
Don
Quixote
,
I
would
know
without
asking
.
He
*NL*
said
it
was
all
done
by
enchantment
.
He
said
there
was
hundreds
of
*NL*
soldiers
there
,
and
elephants
and
treasure
,
and
so
on
,
but
we
had
*NL*
enemies
which
he
called
magicians
,
and
they
had
turned
the
whole
thing
*NL*
into
an
infant
Sunday-school
,
just
out
of
spite
.
I
said
,
all
right
;
*NL*
then
the
thing
for
us
to
do
was
to
go
for
the
magicians
.
Tom
Sawyer
*NL*
said
I
was
a
numskull
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
''
said
he
,
``
a
magician
could
call
up
a
lot
of
genies
,
and
they
*NL*
would
hash
you
up
like
nothing
before
you
could
say
Jack
Robinson
.
*NL*
They
are
as
tall
as
a
tree
and
as
big
around
as
a
church
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
I
says
,
``
s
`
pose
we
got
some
genies
to
help
_
us

*NL*
I
thought
all
this
over
for
two

three
days

then
I
reckoned
I
*NL*
would
see
if
there
was
anything
in
it

I
got
an
old
tin
lamp
and
an
*NL*
iron
ring
,
and
went
out
in
the
woods
and
rubbed
and
rubbed
till
I
*NL*
sweat
like
an
Injun
,
calculating
to
build
a
palace
and
sell
it
;
but
it
*NL*
war
n't
no
use
,
none
of
the
genies
come
.
So
then
I
judged
that
all
that
*NL*
stuff
was
only
just
one
of
Tom
Sawyer
's
lies
.
I
reckoned
he
believed
*NL*
in
the
A-rabs
and
the
elephants
,
but
as
for
me
I
think
different
.
It
*NL*
had
all
the
marks
of
a
Sunday-school

CHAPTER
IV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
three
or
four
months
run
along
,
and
it
was
well
into
the
winter
*NL*
now
.
I
had
been
to
school
most
all
the
time
and
could
spell
and
read
*NL*
and
write
just
a
little
,
and
could
say
the
multiplication
table
up
to
*NL*
six
times
seven
is
thirty-five
,
and
I
do
n't
reckon
I
could
ever
get
*NL*
any
further
than
that
if
I
was
to
live
forever
.
I
do
n't
take
no
stock
*NL*
in
mathematics
,
anyway
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
I
hated
the
school
,
but
by
and
by
I
got
so
I
could
stand
it
.
*NL*
Whenever
I
got
uncommon
tired
I
played
hookey
,
and
the
hiding
I
got
*NL*
next
day
done
me
good
and
cheered
me
up
.
So
the
longer
I
went
to
*NL*
school
the
easier
it
got
to
be
.
I
was
getting
sort
of
used
to
the
*NL*
widow
's
ways
,
too
,
and
they
war
n't
so
raspy
on
me
.
Living
in
a
house
*NL*
and
sleeping
in
a
bed
pulled
on
me
pretty
tight
mostly
,
but
before
the
*NL*
cold
weather
I
used
to
slide
out
and
sleep
in
the
woods
sometimes
,
and
*NL*
so
that
was
a
rest
to
me
.
I
liked
the
old
ways
best
,
but
I
was
getting
*NL*
so
I
liked
the
new
ones
,
too
,
a
little
bit
.
The
widow
said
I
was
*NL*
coming
along
slow
but
sure
,
and
doing
very
satisfactory
.
She
said
she
*NL*
war
n't
ashamed
of
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
I
happened
to
turn
over
the
salt-cellar
at
breakfast
.
I
*NL*
reached
for
some
of
it
as
quick
as
I
could
to
throw
over
my
left
*NL*
shoulder
and
keep
off
the
bad
luck
,
but
Miss
Watson
was
in
ahead
of
*NL*
me
,
and
crossed
me
off
.
She
says
,
``
Take
your
hands
away
,
Huckleberry
;
*NL*
what
a
mess
you
are
always
making
!
''
The
widow
put
in
a
good
word
for
*NL*
me
,
but
that
war
n't
going
to
keep
off
the
bad
luck
,
I
knowed
that
well
*NL*
enough
.
I
started
out
,
after
breakfast
,
feeling
worried
and
shaky
,
and
*NL*
wondering
where
it
was
going
to
fall
on
me
,
and
what
it
was
going
to
*NL*
be
.
There
is
ways
to
keep
off
some
kinds
of
bad
luck
,
but
this
was
n't
*NL*
one
of
them
kind
;
so
I
never
tried
to
do
anything
,
but
just
poked
*NL*
along
low-spirited
and
on
the
watch-out
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
down
to
the
front
garden
and
clumb
over
the
stile
where
you
go
*NL*
through
the
high
board
fence
.
There
was
an
inch
of
new
snow
on
the
*NL*
ground
,
and
I
seen
somebody
's
tracks
.
They
had
come
up
from
the
quarry
*NL*
and
stood
around
the
stile
awhile
,
and
then
went
on
around
the
garden
*NL*
fence
.
It
was
funny
they
had
n't
come
in
,
after
standing
around
so
.
I
*NL*
could
n't
make
it
out
.
It
was
very
curious
,
somehow
.
I
was
going
to
*NL*
follow
around
,
but
I
stooped
down
to
look
at
the
tracks
first
.
I
*NL*
did
n't
notice
anything
at
first
,
but
next
I
did
.
There
was
a
cross
in
*NL*
the
left
boot-heel
made
with
big
nails
,
to
keep
off
the
devil
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
up
in
a
second
and
shinning
down
the
hill
.
I
looked
over
my
*NL*
shoulder
every
now
and
then
,
but
I
did
n't
see
nobody
.
I
was
at
Judge
*NL*
Thatcher
's
as
quick
as
I
could
get
there
.
He
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
my
boy
,
you
are
all
out
of
breath
.
Did
you
come
for
your
*NL*
interest
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
''
I
says
;
``
is
there
some
for
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
a
half-yearly
is
in
last
night
--
over
a
hundred
and
fifty
*NL*
dollars
.
Quite
a
fortune
for
you
.
You
had
better
let
me
invest
it
*NL*
along
with
your
six
thousand
,
because
if
you
take
it
you
'll
spend
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
''
I
says
,
``
I
do
n't
want
to
spend
it
.
I
do
n't
want
it
at
*NL*
all
--
nor
the
six
thousand
,
nuther
.
I
want
you
to
take
it
;
I
want
to
*NL*
give
it
to
you
--
the
six
thousand
and
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
surprised
.
He
could
n't
seem
to
make
it
out
.
He
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
can
you
mean
,
my
boy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
says
,
``
Do
n't
you
ask
me
no
questions
about
it
,
please
.
You
'll
take
*NL*
it
--
wo
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'm
puzzled
.
Is
something
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
take
it
,
''
says
I
,
``
and
do
n't
ask
me
nothing
--
then
I
wo
n't
have
*NL*
to
tell
no
lies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
studied
awhile
,
and
then
he
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oho-o
!
I
think
I
see
.
You
want
to
_
sell
_
all
your
property
to
me
--
not
*NL*
give
it
.
That
's
the
correct
idea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
wrote
something
on
a
paper
and
read
it
over
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
;
you
see
it
says
`
for
a
consideration
.
'
That
means
I
have
*NL*
bought
it
of
you
and
paid
you
for
it
.
Here
's
a
dollar
for
you
.
Now
you
*NL*
sign
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
I
signed
it
,
and
left
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Watson
's
nigger
,
Jim
,
had
a
hair-ball
as
big
as
your
fist
,
which
*NL*
had
been
took
out
of
the
fourth
stomach
of
an
ox
,
and
he
used
to
do
*NL*
magic
with
it
.
He
said
there
was
a
spirit
inside
of
it
,
and
it
knowed
*NL*
everything
.
So
I
went
to
him
that
night
and
told
him
pap
was
here
*NL*
again
,
for
I
found
his
tracks
in
the
snow
.
What
I
wanted
to
know
was
,
*NL*
what
he
was
going
to
do
,
and
was
he
going
to
stay
?
Jim
got
out
his
*NL*
hair-ball
and
said
something
over
it
,
and
then
he
held
it
up
and
*NL*
dropped
it
on
the
floor
.
It
fell
pretty
solid
,
and
only
rolled
about
*NL*
an
inch
.
Jim
tried
it
again
,
and
then
another
time
,
and
it
acted
just
*NL*
the
same
.
Jim
got
down
on
his
knees
,
and
put
his
ear
against
it
and
*NL*
listened
.
But
it
war
n't
no
use
;
he
said
it
would
n't
talk
.
He
said
*NL*
sometimes
it
would
n't
talk
without
money
.
I
told
him
I
had
an
old
*NL*
slick
counterfeit
quarter
that
war
n't
no
good
because
the
brass
showed
*NL*
through
the
silver
a
little
,
and
it
would
n't
pass
nohow
,
even
if
the
*NL*
brass
did
n't
show
,
because
it
was
so
slick
it
felt
greasy
,
and
so
that
*NL*
would
tell
on
it
every
time
.
-LRB-
I
reckoned
I
would
n't
say
nothing
about
*NL*
the
dollar
I
got
from
the
judge
.
-RRB-
I
said
it
was
pretty
bad
money
,
but
*NL*
maybe
the
hair-ball
would
take
it
,
because
maybe
it
would
n't
know
the
*NL*
difference
.
Jim
smelt
it
and
bit
it
and
rubbed
it
,
and
said
he
would
*NL*
manage
so
the
hair-ball
would
think
it
was
good
.
He
said
he
would
*NL*
split
open
a
raw
Irish
potato
and
stick
the
quarter
in
between
and
*NL*
keep
it
there
all
night
,
and
next
morning
you
could
n't
see
no
brass
,
*NL*
and
it
would
n't
feel
greasy
no
more
,
and
so
anybody
in
town
would
take
*NL*
it
in
a
minute
,
let
alone
a
hair-ball
.
Well
,
I
knowed
a
potato
would
*NL*
do
that
before
,
but
I
had
forgot
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jim
put
the
quarter
under
the
hair-ball
,
and
got
down
and
listened
*NL*
again
.
This
time
he
said
the
hair-ball
was
all
right
.
He
said
it
would
*NL*
tell
my
whole
fortune
if
I
wanted
it
to
.
I
says
,
go
on
.
So
the
*NL*
hair-ball
talked
to
Jim
,
and
Jim
told
it
to
me
.
He
says
:
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
I
had
shut
the
door
to

Then
I
turned
around
,
and
there
he
was
.
I
used
*NL*
to
be
scared
of
him
all
the
time
,
he
tanned
me
so
much

I
reckoned
I
*NL*
was
scared
now

too

in

I
see
I
was
mistaken

that
is

first
jolt

when
my

sort

hitched

being

I
war

*NL*
him
worth
bothring
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
most
fifty
,
and
he
looked
it
.
His
hair
was
long
and
tangled
and
*NL*
greasy
,
and
hung
down
,
and
you
could
see
his
eyes
shining
through
like
*NL*
he
was
behind
vines
.
It
was
all
black
,
no
gray
;
so
was
his
long
,
*NL*
mixed-up
whiskers
.
There
war
n't
no
color
in
his
face
,
where
his
face
*NL*
showed
;
it
was
white
;
not
like
another
man
's
white
,
but
a
white
to
*NL*
make
a
body
sick
,
a
white
to
make
a
body
's
flesh
crawl
--
a
tree-toad
*NL*
white
,
a
fish-belly
white
.
As
for
his
clothes
--
just
rags
,
that
was
*NL*
all
.
He
had
one
ankle
resting
on
t
`
other
knee
;
the
boot
on
that
foot
*NL*
was
busted
,
and
two
of
his
toes
stuck
through
,
and
he
worked
them
now
*NL*
and
then
.
His
hat
was
laying
on
the
floor
--
an
old
black
slouch
with
*NL*
the
top
caved
in
,
like
a
lid
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
stood
a-looking
at
him
;
he
set
there
a-looking
at
me
,
with
his
chair
*NL*
tilted
back
a
little
.
I
set
the
candle
down
.
I
noticed
the
window
was
*NL*
up
;
so
he
had
clumb
in
by
the
shed
.
He
kept
a-looking
me
all
over
.
By
*NL*
and
by
he
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Starchy
clothes
--
very
.
You
think
you
're
a
good
deal
of
a
big-bug

you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Maybe
I

maybe
I

I
says
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
give
me
none
o

your

''
says
he
.
``
You

away

I
'll
take
you
down

*NL*
before
I
get
done
with
you
.
You
're
educated

too
,
they
say

and
write

You
think
you

you

*NL*
because
he
ca
n't

_
I
'll

take
it
out
of
you

Who
told
you
you
might
*NL*
meddle
with
such
hifalut
'n
foolishness

?

who
told
you
you
could

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
widow

She
told
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
widow

and
who
told
the
widow

in
her

none
of
her
business

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nobody
never

her

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'll
learn
her
how
to
meddle

And
looky
here
--
you
drop
that
*NL*
school

I
'll
learn
people
to
bring
up

let
on

fooling
around

Your

*NL*
could

she

None

and
here
you

*NL*
a-swelling
yourself
up

you
*NL*

Say
,
lem
me
hear
you
read

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
up
a
book
and
begun
something
about
General
Washington
and
the
*NL*
wars
.
When
I
'd
read
about
a
half
a
minute
,
he
fetched
the
book
a
whack
*NL*
with
his
hand
and
knocked
it
across
the
house
.
He
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
so
.
You
can
do
it

I
had
my
doubts
when
you
told
me

here
;
you
stop
that
putting
on
frills

I
'll

for

you
about

I
'll

'll

too

I
never

such
a

*NL*
*NL*
He
took
up
a
little
blue
and
yaller
picture
of
some
cows
and
a
boy
,
*NL*
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
something
they
give
me
for
learning
my

*NL*
*NL*
He
tore
it
up
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
give
you
something
better
--
I
'll
give
you
a
cowhide
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
set
there
a-mumbling
and
a-growling
a
minute
,
and
then
he
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Ai
n't

*NL*

about

*NL*
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
it
and
bit
it
to
see
if
it
was
good
,
and
then
he
said
he
was
*NL*
going
down-town
to
get
some
whisky
;
said
he
had
n't
had
a
drink
all
*NL*
day
.
When
he
had
got
out
on
the
shed
he
put
his
head
in
again
,
and
*NL*
cussed
me
for
putting
on
frills
and
trying
to
be
better
than
him
;
and
*NL*
when
I
reckoned
he
was
gone
he
come
back
and
put
his
head
in
again
,
*NL*
and
told
me
to
mind
about
that
school
,
because
he
was
going
to
lay
for
*NL*
me
and
lick
me
if
I
did
n't
drop
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
he
was
drunk
,
and
he
went
to
Judge
Thatcher
's
and
bullyragged
*NL*
him
,
and
tried
to
make
him
give
up
the
money
;
but
he
could
n't
,
and
*NL*
then
he
swore
he
'd
make
the
law
force
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
judge
and
the
widow
went
to
law
to
get
the
court
to
take
me
away
*NL*
from
him
and
let
one
of
them
be
my
guardian
;
but
it
was
a
new
judge
*NL*
that
had
just
come
,
and
he
did
n't
know
the
old
man
;
so
he
said
courts
*NL*
must
n't
interfere
and
separate
families
if
they
could
help
it
;
said
*NL*
he
'd
druther
not
take
a
child
away
from
its
father
.
So
Judge
Thatcher
*NL*
and
the
widow
had
to
quit
on
the
business
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
pleased
the
old
man
till
he
could
n't
rest
.
He
said
he
'd
cowhide
*NL*
me
till
I
was
black
and
blue
if
I
did
n't
raise
some
money
for
him
.
I
*NL*
borrowed
three
dollars
from
Judge
Thatcher
,
and
pap
took
it
and
got
*NL*
drunk
,
and
went
a-blowing
around
and
cussing
and
whooping
and
carrying
*NL*
on
;
and
he
kept
it
up
all
over
town
,
with
a
tin
pan
,
till
most
*NL*
midnight
;
then
they
jailed
him
,
and
next
day
they
had
him
before
*NL*
court
,
and
jailed
him
again
for
a
week
.
But
he
said
_
he
_
was
*NL*
satisfied
;
said
he
was
boss
of
his
son
,
and
he
'd
make
it
warm
for
*NL*
_
him
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
got
out
the
new
judge
said
he
was
a-going
to
make
a
man
of
*NL*
him
.
So
he
took
him
to
his
own
house
,
and
dressed
him
up
clean
and
*NL*
nice
,
and
had
him
to
breakfast
and
dinner
and
supper
with
the
family
,
*NL*
and
was
just
old
pie
to
him
,
so
to
speak
.
And
after
supper
he
talked
*NL*
to
him
about
temperance
and
such
things
till
the
old
man
cried
,
and
*NL*
said
he
'd
been
a
fool
,
and
fooled
away
his
life
;
but
now
he
was
*NL*
a-going
to
turn
over
a
new
leaf
and
be
a
man
nobody
would
n't
be
*NL*
ashamed
of
,
and
he
hoped
the
judge
would
help
him
and
not
look
down
on
*NL*
him
.
The
judge
said
he
could
hug
him
for
them
words
;
so
he
cried
,
and
*NL*
his
wife
she
cried
again
;
pap
said
he
'd
been
a
man
that
had
always
*NL*
been
misunderstood
before
,
and
the
judge
said
he
believed
it
.
The
old
*NL*
man
said
that
what
a
man
wanted
that
was
down
was
sympathy
,
and
the
*NL*
judge
said
it
was
so
;
so
they
cried
again
.
And
when
it
was
bedtime
the
*NL*
old
man
rose
up
and
held
out
his
hand
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
at
it
,
gentlemen
and
ladies
all
;
take
a-hold
of
it
;
shake
it
.
*NL*
There
's
a
hand
that
was
the
hand
of
a
hog
;
but
it
ai
n't
so
no
more
;
*NL*
it
's
the
hand
of
a
man
that
's
started
in
on
a
new
life
,
and
'll
die
*NL*
before
he
'll
go
back
.
You
mark
them
words
--
do
n't
forget
I
said
them
.
*NL*
It
's
a
clean
hand
now
;
shake
it
--
do
n't
be
afeard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
they
shook
it
,
one
after
the
other
,
all
around
,
and
cried
.
The
*NL*
judge
's
wife
she
kissed
it
.
Then
the
old
man
he
signed
a
pledge
--
made
*NL*
his
mark
.
The
judge
said
it
was
the
holiest
time
on
record
,
or
*NL*
something
like
that
.
Then
they
tucked
the
old
man
into
a
beautiful
*NL*
room
,
which
was
the
spare
room
,
and
in
the
night
some
time
he
got
*NL*
powerful
thirsty
and
clumb
out
on
to
the
porch-roof
and
slid
down
a
*NL*
stanchion
and
traded
his
new
coat
for
a
jug
of
forty-rod
,
and
clumb
*NL*
back
again
and
had
a
good
old
time
;
and
toward
daylight
he
crawled
out
*NL*
again
,
drunk
as
a
fiddler
,
and
rolled
off
the
porch
and
broke
his
left
*NL*
arm
in
two
places
,
and
was
most
froze
to
death
when
somebody
found
him
*NL*
after
sun-up
.
And
when
they
come
to
look
at
that
spare
room
they
had
*NL*
to
take
soundings
before
they
could
navigate
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
judge
he
felt
kind
of
sore
.
He
said
he
reckoned
a
body
could
*NL*
reform
the
old
man
with
a
shotgun
,
maybe
,
but
he
did
n't
know
no
other
*NL*
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
VI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
pretty
soon
the
old
man
was
up
and
around
again
,
and
then
he
*NL*
went
for
Judge
Thatcher
in
the
courts
to
make
him
give
up
that
money
,
*NL*
and
he
went
for
me
,
too
,
for
not
stopping
school
.
He
catched
me
a
*NL*
couple
of
times
and
thrashed
me
,
but
I
went
to
school
just
the
same
,
*NL*
and
dodged
him
or
outrun
him
most
of
the
time
.
I
did
n't
want
to
go
to
*NL*
school
much
before
,
but
I
reckoned
I
'd
go
now
to
spite
pap
.
That
law
*NL*
trial
was
a
slow
business
--
appeared
like
they
war
n't
ever
going
to
get
*NL*
started
on
it
;
so
every
now
and
then
I
'd
borrow
two
or
three
dollars
*NL*
off
of
the
judge
for
him
,
to
keep
from
getting
a
cowhiding
.
Every
time
*NL*
he
got
money
he
got
drunk
;
and
every
time
he
got
drunk
he
raised
Cain
*NL*
around
town
;
and
every
time
he
raised
Cain
he
got
jailed
.
He
was
just
*NL*
suited
--
this
kind
of
thing
was
right
in
his
line
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
got
to
hanging
around
the
widow
's
too
much
,
and
so
she
told
him
at
*NL*
last
that
if
he
did
n't
quit
using
around
there
she
would
make
trouble
*NL*
for
him
.
Well
,
_
was
n't
_
he
mad
?
He
said
he
would
show
who
was
Huck
*NL*
Finn
's
boss
.
So
he
watched
out
for
me
one
day
in
the
spring
,
and
*NL*
catched
me
,
and
took
me
up
the
river
about
three
mile
in
a
skiff
,
and
*NL*
crossed
over
to
the
Illinois
shore
where
it
was
woody
and
there
war
n't
*NL*
no
houses
but
an
old
log
hut
in
a
place
where
the
timber
was
so
thick
*NL*
you
could
n't
find
it
if
you
did
n't
know
where
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
kept
me
with
him
all
the
time
,
and
I
never
got
a
chance
to
run
off
.
*NL*
We
lived
in
that
old
cabin
,
and
he
always
locked
the
door
and
put
the
*NL*
key
under
his
head
nights
.
He
had
a
gun
which
he
had
stole
,
I
reckon
,
*NL*
and
we
fished
and
hunted
,
and
that
was
what
we
lived
on
.
Every
little
*NL*
while
he
locked
me
in
and
went
down
to
the
store
,
three
miles
,
to
the
*NL*
ferry
,
and
traded
fish
and
game
for
whisky
,
and
fetched
it
home
and
*NL*
got
drunk
and
had
a
good
time
,
and
licked
me
.
The
widow
she
found
out
*NL*
where
I
was
by
and
by
,
and
she
sent
a
man
over
to
try
to
get
hold
of
*NL*
me
;
but
pap
drove
him
off
with
the
gun
,
and
it
war
n't
long
after
that
*NL*
till
I
was
used
to
being
where
I
was
,
and
liked
it
--
all
but
the
*NL*
cowhide
part
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
kind
of
lazy
and
jolly
,
laying
off
comfortable
all
day
,
smoking
*NL*
and
fishing
,
and
no
books
nor
study
.
Two
months
or
more
run
along
,
and
*NL*
my
clothes
got
to
be
all
rags
and
dirt
,
and
I
did
n't
see
how
I
'd
ever
*NL*
got
to
like
it
so
well
at
the
widow
's
,
where
you
had
to
wash
,
and
eat
*NL*
on
a
plate
,
and
comb
up
,
and
go
to
bed
and
get
up
regular
,
and
be
*NL*
forever
bothering
over
a
book
,
and
have
old
Miss
Watson
pecking
at
you
*NL*
all
the
time
.
I
did
n't
want
to
go
back
no
more
.
I
had
stopped
cussing
,
*NL*
because
the
widow
did
n't
like
it
;
but
now
I
took
to
it
again
because
*NL*
pap
had
n't
no
objections
.
It
was
pretty
good
times
up
in
the
woods
*NL*
there
,
take
it
all
around
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
by
and
by
pap
got
too
handy
with
his
hick
`
ry
,
and
I
could
n't
stand
*NL*
it
.
I
was
all
over
welts
.
He
got
to
going
away
so
much
,
too
,
and
*NL*
locking
me
in
.
Once
he
locked
me
in
and
was
gone
three
days
.
It
was
*NL*
dreadful
lonesome
.
I
judged
he
had
got
drownded
,
and
I
was
n't
ever
*NL*
going
to
get
out
any
more
.
I
was
scared
.
I
made
up
my
mind
I
would
fix
*NL*
up
some
way
to
leave
there
.
I
had
tried
to
get
out
of
that
cabin
many
*NL*
a
time
,
but
I
could
n't
find
no
way
.
There
war
n't
a
window
to
it
big
*NL*
enough
for
a
dog
to
get
through
.
I
could
n't
get
up
the
chimbly
;
it
was
*NL*
too
narrow
.
The
door
was
thick
,
solid
oak
slabs
.
Pap
was
pretty
*NL*
careful
not
to
leave
a
knife
or
anything
in
the
cabin
when
he
was
*NL*
away
;
I
reckon
I
had
hunted
the
place
over
as
much
as
a
hundred
times
;
*NL*
well
,
I
was
most
all
the
time
at
it
,
because
it
was
about
the
only
way
*NL*
to
put
in
the
time
.
But
this
time
I
found
something
at
last
;
I
found
*NL*
an
old
rusty
wood-saw
without
any
handle
;
it
was
laid
in
between
a
*NL*
rafter
and
the
clapboards
of
the
roof
.
I
greased
it
up
and
went
to
*NL*
work
.
There
was
an
old
horse-blanket
nailed
against
the
logs
at
the
*NL*
far
end
of
the
cabin
behind
the
table
,
to
keep
the
wind
from
blowing
*NL*
through
the
chinks
and
putting
the
candle
out
.
I
got
under
the
table
*NL*
and
raised
the
blanket
,
and
went
to
work
to
saw
a
section
of
the
big
*NL*
bottom
log
out
--
big
enough
to
let
me
through
.
Well
,
it
was
a
good
long
*NL*
job
,
but
I
was
getting
toward
the
end
of
it
when
I
heard
pap
's
gun
in
*NL*
the
woods
.
I
got
rid
of
the
signs
of
my
work
,
and
dropped
the
blanket
*NL*
and
hid
my
saw
,
and
pretty
soon
pap
come
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pap
war
n't
in
a
good
humor
--
so
he
was
his
natural
self
.
He
said
he
was
*NL*
down-town
,
and
everything
was
going
wrong
.
His
lawyer
said
he
reckoned
*NL*
he
would
win
his
lawsuit
and
get
the
money
if
they
ever
got
started
on
*NL*
the
trial
;
but
then
there
was
ways
to
put
it
off
a
long
time
,
and
*NL*
Judge
Thatcher
knowed
how
to
do
it
.
And
he
said
people
allowed
there
'd
*NL*
be
another
trial
to
get
me
away
from
him
and
give
me
to
the
widow
for
*NL*
my
guardian
,
and
they
guessed
it
would
win
this
time
.
This
shook
me
up
*NL*
considerable
,
because
I
did
n't
want
to
go
back
to
the
widow
's
any
more
*NL*
and
be
so
cramped
up
and
sivilized
,
as
they
called
it
.
Then
the
old
*NL*
man
got
to
cussing
,
and
cussed
everything
and
everybody
he
could
think
*NL*
of
,
and
then
cussed
them
all
over
again
to
make
sure
he
had
n't
skipped
*NL*
any
,
and
after
that
he
polished
off
with
a
kind
of
a
general
cuss
all
*NL*
round
,
including
a
considerable
parcel
of
people
which
he
did
n't
know
*NL*
the
names
of
,
and
so
called
them
what
's
-
his-name
when
he
got
to
them
,
*NL*
and
went
right
along
with
his
cussing
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
he
would
like
to
see
the
widow
get
me
.
He
said
he
would
watch
*NL*
out
,
and
if
they
tried
to
come
any
such
game
on
him
he
knowed
of
a
*NL*
place
six
or
seven
mile
off
to
stow
me
in
,
where
they
might
hunt
till
*NL*
they
dropped
and
they
could
n't
find
me
.
That
made
me
pretty
uneasy
*NL*
again
,
but
only
for
a
minute
;
I
reckoned
I
would
n't
stay
on
hand
till
*NL*
he
got
that
chance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
made
me
go
to
the
skiff
and
fetch
the
things
he
had
got
.
*NL*
There
was
a
fifty-pound
sack
of
corn
meal
,
and
a
side
of
bacon
,
*NL*
ammunition
,
and
a
four-gallon
jug
of
whisky
,
and
an
old
book
and
two
*NL*
newspapers
for
wadding
,
besides
some
tow
.
I
toted
up
a
load
,
and
went
*NL*
back
and
set
down
on
the
bow
of
the
skiff
to
rest
.
I
thought
it
all
*NL*
over
,
and
I
reckoned
I
would
walk
off
with
the
gun
and
some
lines
,
and
*NL*
take
to
the
woods
when
I
run
away
.
I
guessed
I
would
n't
stay
in
one
*NL*
place
,
but
just
tramp
right
across
the
country
,
mostly
night-times
,
*NL*
and
hunt
and
fish
to
keep
alive
,
and
so
get
so
far
away
that
the
old
*NL*
man
nor
the
widow
could
n't
ever
find
me
any
more
.
I
judged
I
would
saw
*NL*
out
and
leave
that
night
if
pap
got
drunk
enough
,
and
I
reckoned
he
*NL*
would
.
I
got
so
full
of
it
I
did
n't
notice
how
long
I
was
staying
till
*NL*
the
old
man
hollered
and
asked
me
whether
I
was
asleep
or
drownded
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
got
the
things
all
up
to
the
cabin
,
and
then
it
was
about
dark
.
*NL*
While
I
was
cooking
supper
the
old
man
took
a
swig
or
two
and
got
sort
*NL*
of
warmed
up
,
and
went
to
ripping
again
.
He
had
been
drunk
over
in
*NL*
town
,
and
laid
in
the
gutter
all
night
,
and
he
was
a
sight
to
look
at
.
*NL*
A
body
would
`
a
'
thought
he
was
Adam
--
he
was
just
all
mud
.
Whenever
*NL*
his
liquor
begun
to
work
he
most
always
went
for
the
govment
.
This
*NL*
time
he
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Call
this
a
govment
!
why
,
just
look
at
it
and
see
what
it
's
like
.
*NL*
Here
's
the
law
a-standing
ready
to
take
a
man
's
son
away
from
him
--
a
*NL*
man
's
own
son
,
which
he
has
had
all
the
trouble
and
all
the
anxiety
*NL*
and
all
the
expense
of
raising
.
Yes
,
just
as
that
man
has
got
that
son
*NL*
raised
at
last
,
and
ready
to
go
to
work
and
begin
to
do
suthin
'
for
*NL*
_
him
_
and
give
him
a
rest
,
the
law
up
and
goes
for
him
.
And
they
call
*NL*
_
that
_
govment
!
That
ai
n't
all
,
nuther
.
The
law
backs
that
old
Judge
*NL*
Thatcher
up
and
helps
him
to
keep
me
out
o
'
my
property
.
Here
's
what
*NL*
the
law
does
:
The
law
takes
a
man
worth
six
thousand
dollars
and
*NL*
up
`
ards
,
and
jams
him
into
an
old
trap
of
a
cabin
like
this
,
and
lets
*NL*
him
go
round
in
clothes
that
ai
n't
fitten
for
a
hog
.
They
call
that
*NL*
govment
!
A
man
ca
n't
get
his
rights
in
a
govment
like
this
.
Sometimes
*NL*
I
've
a
mighty
notion
to
just
leave
the
country
for
good
and
all
.
Yes
,
*NL*
and
I
_
told
_
'em
so
;
I
told
old
Thatcher
so
to
his
face
.
Lots
of
'em
*NL*
heard
me
,
and
can
tell
what
I
said
.
Says
I
,
for
two
cents
I
'd
leave
*NL*
the
blamed
country
and
never
come
a-near
it
ag
`
in
.
Them
's
the
very
*NL*
words
.
I
says
,
look
at
my
hat
--
if
you
call
it
a
hat
--
but
the
lid
*NL*
raises
up
and
the
rest
of
it
goes
down
till
it
's
below
my
chin
,
and
*NL*
then
it
ai
n't
rightly
a
hat
at
all
,
but
more
like
my
head
was
shoved
*NL*
up
through
a
jint
o
'
stove-pipe
.
Look
at
it
,
says
I
--
such
a
hat
for
me
*NL*
to
wear
--
one
of
the
wealthiest
men
in
this
town
if
I
could
git
my
*NL*
rights
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
this
is
a
wonderful
govment
,
wonderful
.
Why
,
looky
here
.
*NL*
There
was
a
free
nigger
there
from
Ohio
--
a
mulatter
,
most
as
white
as
*NL*
a
white
man
.
He
had
the
whitest
shirt
on
you
ever
see
,
too
,
and
the
*NL*
shiniest
hat
;
and
there
ai
n't
a
man
in
that
town
that
's
got
as
fine
*NL*
clothes
as
what
he
had
;
and
he
had
a
gold
watch
and
chain
,
and
a
*NL*
silver-headed
cane
--
the
awfulest
old
gray-headed
nabob
in
the
state
.
*NL*
And
what
do
you
think
?
They
said
he
was
a
p
`
fessor
in
a
college
,
and
*NL*
could
talk
all
kinds
of
languages
,
and
knowed
everything
.
And
that
*NL*
ai
n't
the
wust
.
They
said
he
could
_
vote
_
when
he
was
at
home
.
Well
,
*NL*
that
let
me
out
.
Thinks
I
,
what
is
the
country
a-coming
to
?
It
was
*NL*
`
lection
day
,
and
I
was
just
about
to
go
and
vote
myself
if
I
war
n't
*NL*
too
drunk
to
get
there
;
but
when
they
told
me
there
was
a
state
in
*NL*
this
country
where
they
'd
let
that
nigger
vote
,
I
drawed
out
.
I
says
*NL*
I
'll
never
vote
ag
`
in
.
Them
's
the
very
words
I
said
;
they
all
heard
*NL*
me
;
and
the
country
may
rot
for
all
me
--
I
'll
never
vote
ag
`
in
as
long
*NL*
as
I
live
.
And
to
see
the
cool
way
of
that
nigger
--
why
,
he
would
n't
*NL*
`
a
'
give
me
the
road
if
I
had
n't
shoved
him
out
o
'
the
way
.
I
says
to
*NL*
the
people
,
why
ai
n't
this
nigger
put
up
at
auction
and
sold
?
--
that
's
*NL*
what
I
want
to
know
.
And
what
do
you
reckon
they
said
?
Why
,
they
said
*NL*
he
could
n't
be
sold
till
he
'd
been
in
the
state
six
months
,
and
he
*NL*
had
n't
been
there
that
long
yet
.
There
,
now
--
that
's
a
specimen
.
They
*NL*
call
that
a
govment
that
ca
n't
sell
a
free
nigger
till
he
's
been
in
*NL*
the
state
six
months
.
Here
's
a
govment
that
calls
itself
a
govment
,
*NL*
and
lets
on
to
be
a
govment
,
and
thinks
it
is
a
govment
,
and
yet
's
got
*NL*
to
set
stock-still
for
six
whole
months
before
it
can
take
a-hold
of
a
*NL*
prowling
,
thieving
,
infernal
,
white-shirted
free
nigger
,
and
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pap
was
a-going
on
so
he
never
noticed
where
his
old
limber
legs
was
*NL*
taking
him
to
,
so
he
went
head
over
heels
over
the
tub
of
salt
pork
*NL*
and
barked
both
shins
,
and
the
rest
of
his
speech
was
all
the
hottest
*NL*
kind
of
language
--
mostly
hove
at
the
nigger
and
the
govment
,
though
he
*NL*
give
the
tub
some
,
too
,
all
along
,
here
and
there
.
He
hopped
around
*NL*
the
cabin
considerable
,
first
on
one
leg
and
then
on
the
other
,
*NL*
holding
first
one
shin
and
then
the
other
one
,
and
at
last
he
let
out
*NL*
with
his
left
foot
all
of
a
sudden
and
fetched
the
tub
a
rattling
*NL*
kick
.
But
it
war
n't
good
judgment
,
because
that
was
the
boot
that
had
*NL*
a
couple
of
his
toes
leaking
out
of
the
front
end
of
it
;
so
now
he
*NL*
raised
a
howl
that
fairly
made
a
body
's
hair
raise
,
and
down
he
went
*NL*
in
the
dirt
,
and
rolled
there
,
and
held
his
toes
;
and
the
cussing
he
*NL*
done
then
laid
over
anything
he
had
ever
done
previous
.
He
said
so
his
*NL*
own
self
afterwards
.
He
had
heard
old
Sowberry
Hagan
in
his
best
days
,
*NL*
and
he
said
it
laid
over
him
,
too
;
but
I
reckon
that
was
sort
of
*NL*
piling
it
on
,
maybe
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
supper
pap
took
the
jug
,
and
said
he
had
enough
whisky
there
for
*NL*
two
drunks
and
one
delirium
tremens
.
That
was
always
his
word
.
I
*NL*
judged
he
would
be
blind
drunk
in
about
an
hour
,
and
then
I
would
*NL*
steal
the
key
,
or
saw
myself
out
,
one
or
t
`
other
.
He
drank
and
drank
,
*NL*
and
tumbled
down
on
his
blankets
by
and
by
;
but
luck
did
n't
run
my
*NL*
way
.
He
did
n't
go
sound
asleep
,
but
was
uneasy
.
He
groaned
and
moaned
*NL*
and
thrashed
around
this
way
and
that
for
a
long
time
.
At
last
I
got
*NL*
so
sleepy
I
could
n't
keep
my
eyes
open
all
I
could
do
,
and
so
before
I
*NL*
knowed
what
I
was
about
I
was
sound
asleep
,
and
the
candle
burning
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
n't
know
how
long
I
was
asleep
,
but
all
of
a
sudden
there
was
an
*NL*
awful
scream
and
I
was
up
.
There
was
pap
looking
wild
,
and
skipping
*NL*
around
every
which
way
and
yelling
about
snakes
.
He
said
they
was
*NL*
crawling
up
his
legs
;
and
then
he
would
give
a
jump
and
scream
,
and
*NL*
say
one
had
bit
him
on
the
cheek
--
but
I
could
n't
see
no
snakes
.
He
*NL*
started
and
run
round
and
round
the
cabin
,
hollering
``
Take
him
off
!
*NL*
take
him
off
!
he
's
biting
me
on
the
neck
!
''
I
never
see
a
man
look
so
*NL*
wild
in
the
eyes
.
Pretty
soon
he
was
all
fagged
out
,
and
fell
down
*NL*
panting
;
then
he
rolled
over
and
over
wonderful
fast
,
kicking
things
*NL*
every
which
way
,
and
striking
and
grabbing
at
the
air
with
his
hands
,
*NL*
and
screaming
and
saying
there
was
devils
a-hold
of
him
.
He
wore
out
*NL*
by
and
by
,
and
laid
still
awhile
,
moaning
.
Then
he
laid
stiller
,
and
*NL*
did
n't
make
a
sound
.
I
could
hear
the
owls
and
the
wolves
away
off
in
*NL*
the
woods
,
and
it
seemed
terrible
still
.
He
was
laying
over
by
the
*NL*
corner
.
By
and
by
he
raised
up
part
way
and
listened
,
with
his
head
to
*NL*
one
side
.
He
says
,
very
low
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tramp
--
tramp
--
tramp
;
that
's
the
dead
;
tramp
--
tramp
--
tramp
;
they
're
*NL*
coming
after
me
;
but
I
wo
n't
go
.
Oh
,
they
're
here
!
do
n't
touch
*NL*
me
--
do
n't
!
hands
off
--
they
're
cold
;
let
go
.
Oh
,
let
a
poor
devil
*NL*
alone
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
went
down
on
all
fours
and
crawled
off
,
begging
them
to
let
*NL*
him
alone
,
and
he
rolled
himself
up
in
his
blanket
and
wallowed
in
*NL*
under
the
old
pine
table
,
still
a-begging
;
and
then
he
went
to
crying
.
*NL*
I
could
hear
him
through
the
blanket
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
and
by
he
rolled
out
and
jumped
up
on
his
feet
looking
wild
,
and
he
*NL*
see
me
and
went
for
me
.
He
chased
me
round
and
round
the
place
with
a
*NL*
clasp-knife
,
calling
me
the
Angel
of
Death
,
and
saying
he
would
kill
*NL*
me
,
and
then
I
could
n't
come
for
him
no
more
.
I
begged
,
and
told
him
I
*NL*
was
only
Huck
;
but
he
laughed
_
such
_
a
screechy
laugh
,
and
roared
and
*NL*
cussed
,
and
kept
on
chasing
me
up
.
Once
when
I
turned
short
and
dodged
*NL*
under
his
arm
he
made
a
grab
and
got
me
by
the
jacket
between
my
*NL*
shoulders
,
and
I
thought
I
was
gone
;
but
I
slid
out
of
the
jacket
*NL*
quick
as
lightning
,
and
saved
myself
.
Pretty
soon
he
was
all
tired
*NL*
out
,
and
dropped
down
with
his
back
against
the
door
,
and
said
he
*NL*
would
rest
a
minute
and
then
kill
me
.
He
put
his
knife
under
him
,
and
*NL*
said
he
would
sleep
and
get
strong
,
and
then
he
would
see
who
was
who
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
dozed
off
pretty
soon
.
By
and
by
I
got
the
old
split-bottom
*NL*
chair
and
clumb
up
as
easy
as
I
could
,
not
to
make
any
noise
,
and
got
*NL*
down
the
gun
.
I
slipped
the
ramrod
down
it
to
make
sure
it
was
loaded
,
*NL*
and
then
I
laid
it
across
the
turnip-barrel
,
pointing
towards
pap
,
and
*NL*
set
down
behind
it
to
wait
for
him
to
stir
.
And
how
slow
and
still
the
*NL*
time
did
drag
along
.

CHAPTER
VII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Git
up
!
What
you
`
bout
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
opened
my
eyes
and
looked
around
,
trying
to
make
out
where
I
was
.
It
*NL*
was
after
sun-up
,
and
I
had
been
sound
asleep
.
Pap
was
standing
over
*NL*
me
looking
sour
--
and
sick
,
too
.
He
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
you
doin
'
with
this
gun
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
judged
he
did
n't
know
nothing
about
what
he
had
been
doing
,
so
I
*NL*
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Somebody
tried
to
get
in
,
so
I
was
laying
for
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
n't
you
roust
me
out
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
tried
to
,
but
I
could
n't
;
I
could
n't
budge
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
all
right
.
Do
n't
stand
there
palavering
all
day
,
but
out
with
*NL*
you
and
see
if
there
's
a
fish
on
the
lines
for
breakfast
.
I
'll
be
*NL*
along
in
a
minute
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
unlocked
the
door
,
and
I
cleared
out
up
the
river-bank
.
I
noticed
*NL*
some
pieces
of
limbs
and
such
things
floating
down
,
and
a
sprinkling
*NL*
of
bark
;
so
I
knowed
the
river
had
begun
to
rise
.
I
reckoned
I
would
*NL*
have
great
times
now
if
I
was
over
at
the
town
.
The
June
rise
used
to
*NL*
be
always
luck
for
me
;
because
as
soon
as
that
rise
begins
here
comes
*NL*
cordwood
floating
down
,
and
pieces
of
log
rafts
--
sometimes
a
dozen
*NL*
logs
together
;
so
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
catch
them
and
sell
them
to
*NL*
the
woodyards
and
the
sawmill
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
along
up
the
bank
with
one
eye
out
for
pap
and
t
`
other
one
out
*NL*
for
what
the
rise
might
fetch
along
.
Well
,
all
at
once
here
comes
a
*NL*
canoe
;
just
a
beauty
,
too
,
about
thirteen
or
fourteen
foot
long
,
*NL*
riding
high
like
a
duck
.
I
shot
head-first
off
of
the
bank
like
a
*NL*
frog
,
clothes
and
all
on
,
and
struck
out
for
the
canoe
.
I
just
*NL*
expected
there
'd
be
somebody
laying
down
in
it
,
because
people
often
*NL*
done
that
to
fool
folks
,
and
when
a
chap
had
pulled
a
skiff
out
most
*NL*
to
it
they
'd
raise
up
and
laugh
at
him
.
But
it
war
n't
so
this
time
.
It
*NL*
was
a
drift-canoe
sure
enough
,
and
I
clumb
in
and
paddled
her
ashore
.
*NL*
Thinks
I
,
the
old
man
will
be
glad
when
he
sees
this
--
she
's
worth
ten
*NL*
dollars
.
But
when
I
got
to
shore
pap
was
n't
in
sight
yet
,
and
as
I
was
*NL*
running
her
into
a
little
creek
like
a
gully
,
all
hung
over
with
vines
*NL*
and
willows
,
I
struck
another
idea
:
I
judged
I
'd
hide
her
good
,
and
*NL*
then
,
`
stead
of
taking
to
the
woods
when
I
run
off
,
I
'd
go
down
the
*NL*
river
about
fifty
mile
and
camp
in
one
place
for
good
,
and
not
have
*NL*
such
a
rough
time
tramping
on
foot
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
pretty
close
to
the
shanty
,
and
I
thought
I
heard
the
old
man
*NL*
coming
all
the
time
;
but
I
got
her
hid
;
and
then
I
out
and
looked
*NL*
around
a
bunch
of
willows
,
and
there
was
the
old
man
down
the
path
a
*NL*
piece
just
drawing
a
bead
on
a
bird
with
his
gun
.
So
he
had
n't
seen
*NL*
anything
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
got
along
I
was
hard
at
it
taking
up
a
``
trot
''
line
.
He
abused
*NL*
me
a
little
for
being
so
slow
;
but
I
told
him
I
fell
in
the
river
,
and
*NL*
that
was
what
made
me
so
long
.
I
knowed
he
would
see
I
was
wet
,
and
*NL*
then
he
would
be
asking
questions
.
We
got
five
catfish
off
the
lines
*NL*
and
went
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
we
laid
off
after
breakfast
to
sleep
up
,
both
of
us
being
about
*NL*
wore
out
,
I
got
to
thinking
that
if
I
could
fix
up
some
way
to
keep
*NL*
pap
and
the
widow
from
trying
to
follow
me
,
it
would
be
a
certainer
*NL*
thing
than
trusting
to
luck
to
get
far
enough
off
before
they
missed
*NL*
me
;
you
see
,
all
kinds
of
things
might
happen
.
Well
,
I
did
n't
see
no
*NL*
way
for
a
while
,
but
by
and
by
pap
raised
up
a
minute
to
drink
another
*NL*
barrel
of
water
,
and
he
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Another
time
a
man
comes
a-prowling
round
here
you
roust
me
out
,
you
*NL*
hear
?
That
man
war
n't
here
for
no
good
.
I
'd
a
shot
him
.
Next
time
you
*NL*
roust
me
out
,
you
hear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
dropped
down
and
went
to
sleep
again
;
what
he
had
been
saying
*NL*
give
me
the
very
idea
I
wanted
.
I
says
to
myself
,
I
can
fix
it
now
so
*NL*
nobody
wo
n't
think
of
following
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
twelve
o'clock
we
turned
out
and
went
along
up
the
bank
.
The
*NL*
river
was
coming
up
pretty
fast
,
and
lots
of
driftwood
going
by
on
the
*NL*
rise
.
By
and
by
along
comes
part
of
a
log
raft
--
nine
logs
fast
*NL*
together
.
We
went
out
with
the
skiff
and
towed
it
ashore
.
Then
we
had
*NL*
dinner
.
Anybody
but
pap
would
`
a
'
waited
and
seen
the
day
through
,
so
*NL*
as
to
catch
more
stuff
;
but
that
war
n't
pap
's
style
.
Nine
logs
was
*NL*
enough
for
one
time
;
he
must
shove
right
over
to
town
and
sell
.
So
he
*NL*
locked
me
in
and
took
the
skiff
,
and
started
off
towing
the
raft
about
*NL*
half
past
three
.
I
judged
he
would
n't
come
back
that
night
.
I
waited
*NL*
till
I
reckoned
he
had
got
a
good
start
;
then
I
out
with
my
saw
,
and
*NL*
went
to
work
on
that
log
again
.
Before
he
was
t
`
other
side
of
the
*NL*
river
I
was
out
of
the
hole
;
him
and
his
raft
was
just
a
speck
on
the
*NL*
water
away
off
yonder
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
I
took
the
sack
of
corn
meal
and
took
it
to
where
the
canoe
was
hid
,
*NL*
and
shoved
the
vines
and
branches
apart
and
put
it
in
;
then
I
done
the
*NL*
same
with
the
side
of
bacon
;
then
the
whisky-jug
.
I
took
all
the
*NL*
coffee
and
sugar
there
was
,
and
all
the
ammunition
;
I
took
the
*NL*
wadding
;
I
took
the
bucket
and
gourd
;
took
a
dipper
and
a
tin
cup
,
and
*NL*
my
old
saw
and
two
blankets
,
and
the
skillet
and
the
coffee-pot
.
I
*NL*
took
fish-lines
and
matches
and
other
things
--
everything
that
was
*NL*
worth
a
cent
.
I
cleaned
out
the
place
.
I
wanted
an
ax
,
but
there
*NL*
was
n't
any
,
only
the
one
out
at
the
woodpile
,
and
I
knowed
why
I
was
*NL*
going
to
leave
that
.
I
fetched
out
the
gun
,
and
now
I
was
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
wore
the
ground
a
good
deal
crawling
out
of
the
hole
and
*NL*
dragging
out
so
many
things
.
So
I
fixed
that
as
good
as
I
could
from
*NL*
the
outside
by
scattering
dust
on
the
place
,
which
covered
up
the
*NL*
smoothness
and
the
sawdust
.
Then
I
fixed
the
piece
of
log
back
into
*NL*
its
place
,
and
put
two
rocks
under
it
and
one
against
it
to
hold
it
*NL*
there
,
for
it
was
bent
up
at
that
place
and
did
n't
quite
touch
ground
.
*NL*
If
you
stood
four
or
five
foot
away
and
did
n't
know
it
was
sawed
,
you
*NL*
would
n't
never
notice
it
;
and
besides
,
this
was
the
back
of
the
cabin
,
*NL*
and
it
war
n't
likely
anybody
would
go
fooling
around
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
all
grass
clear
to
the
canoe
,
so
I
had
n't
left
a
track
.
I
*NL*
followed
around
to
see
.
I
stood
on
the
bank
and
looked
out
over
the
*NL*
river
.
All
safe
.
So
I
took
the
gun
and
went
up
a
piece
into
the
woods
,
*NL*
and
was
hunting
around
for
some
birds
when
I
see
a
wild
pig
;
hogs
soon
*NL*
went
wild
in
them
bottoms
after
they
had
got
away
from
the
*NL*
prairie-farms
.
I
shot
this
fellow
and
took
him
into
camp
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
the
ax
and
smashed
in
the
door
.
I
beat
it
and
hacked
it
*NL*
considerable
a-doing
it
.
I
fetched
the
pig
in
,
and
took
him
back
*NL*
nearly
to
the
table
and
hacked
into
his
throat
with
the
ax
,
and
laid
*NL*
him
down
on
the
ground
to
bleed
;
I
say
ground
because
it
was
*NL*
ground
--
hard
packed
,
and
no
boards
.
Well
,
next
I
took
an
old
sack
and
*NL*
put
a
lot
of
big
rocks
in
it
--
all
I
could
drag
--
and
I
started
it
from
*NL*
the
pig
,
and
dragged
it
to
the
door
and
through
the
woods
down
to
the
*NL*
river
and
dumped
it
in
,
and
down
it
sunk
,
out
of
sight
.
You
could
easy
*NL*
see
that
something
had
been
dragged
over
the
ground
.
I
did
wish
Tom
*NL*
Sawyer
was
there
;
I
knowed
he
would
take
an
interest
in
this
kind
of
*NL*
business
,
and
throw
in
the
fancy
touches
.
Nobody
could
spread
himself
*NL*
like
Tom
Sawyer
in
such
a
thing
as
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
last
I
pulled
out
some
of
my
hair
,
and
blooded
the
ax
good
,
and
*NL*
stuck
it
on
the
back
side
,
and
slung
the
ax
in
the
corner
.
Then
I
took
*NL*
up
the
pig
and
held
him
to
my
breast
with
my
jacket
-LRB-
so
he
could
n't
*NL*
drip
-RRB-
till
I
got
a
good
piece
below
the
house
and
then
dumped
him
into
*NL*
the
river
.
Now
I
thought
of
something
else
.
So
I
went
and
got
the
bag
*NL*
of
meal
and
my
old
saw
out
of
the
canoe
,
and
fetched
them
to
the
*NL*
house
.
I
took
the
bag
to
where
it
used
to
stand
,
and
ripped
a
hole
in
*NL*
the
bottom
of
it
with
the
saw
,
for
there
war
n't
no
knives
and
forks
on
*NL*
the
place
--
pap
done
everything
with
his
clasp-knife
about
the
cooking
.
*NL*
Then
I
carried
the
sack
about
a
hundred
yards
across
the
grass
and
*NL*
through
the
willows
east
of
the
house
,
to
a
shallow
lake
that
was
five
*NL*
mile
wide
and
full
of
rushes
--
and
ducks
too
,
you
might
say
,
in
the
*NL*
season
.
There
was
a
slough
or
a
creek
leading
out
of
it
on
the
other
*NL*
side
that
went
miles
away
,
I
do
n't
know
where
,
but
it
did
n't
go
to
the
*NL*
river
.
The
meal
sifted
out
and
made
a
little
track
all
the
way
to
the
*NL*
lake
.
I
dropped
pap
's
whetstone
there
too
,
so
as
to
look
like
it
had
*NL*
been
done
by
accident
.
Then
I
tied
up
the
rip
in
the
meal-sack
with
a
*NL*
string
,
so
it
would
n't
leak
no
more
,
and
took
it
and
my
saw
to
the
*NL*
canoe
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
about
dark
now
;
so
I
dropped
the
canoe
down
the
river
under
*NL*
some
willows
that
hung
over
the
bank
,
and
waited
for
the
moon
to
rise
.
*NL*
I
made
fast
to
a
willow
;
then
I
took
a
bite
to
eat
,
and
by
and
by
laid
*NL*
down
in
the
canoe
to
smoke
a
pipe
and
lay
out
a
plan
.
I
says
to
*NL*
myself
,
they
'll
follow
the
track
of
that
sackful
of
rocks
to
the
shore
*NL*
and
then
drag
the
river
for
me
.
And
they
'll
follow
that
meal
track
to
*NL*
the
lake
and
go
browsing
down
the
creek
that
leads
out
of
it
to
find
*NL*
the
robbers
that
killed
me
and
took
the
things
.
They
wo
n't
ever
hunt
*NL*
the
river
for
anything
but
my
dead
carcass
.
They
'll
soon
get
tired
of
*NL*
that
,
and
wo
n't
bother
no
more
about
me
.
All
right
;
I
can
stop
*NL*
anywhere
I
want
to
.
Jackson
's
Island
is
good
enough
for
me
;
I
know
*NL*
that
island
pretty
well
,
and
nobody
ever
comes
there
.
And
then
I
can
*NL*
paddle
over
to
town
nights
,
and
slink
around
and
pick
up
things
I
*NL*
want
.
Jackson
's
Island
's
the
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
pretty
tired
,
and
the
first
thing
I
knowed
I
was
asleep
.
When
I
*NL*
woke
up
I
did
n't
know
where
I
was
for
a
minute
.
I
set
up
and
looked
*NL*
around
,
a
little
scared
.
Then
I
remembered
.
The
river
looked
miles
and
*NL*
miles
across
.
The
moon
was
so
bright
I
could
`
a
'
counted
the
*NL*
drift-logs
that
went
a-slipping
along
,
black
and
still
,
hundreds
of
*NL*
yards
out
from
shore
.
Everything
was
dead
quiet
,
and
it
looked
late
,
*NL*
and
_
smelt
_
late
.
You
know
what
I
mean
--
I
do
n't
know
the
words
to
put
*NL*
it
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
a
good
gap
and
a
stretch
,
and
was
just
going
to
unhitch
and
*NL*
start
when
I
heard
a
sound
away
over
the
water
.
I
listened
.
Pretty
*NL*
soon
I
made
it
out
.
It
was
that
dull
kind
of
a
regular
sound
that
*NL*
comes
from
oars
working
in
rowlocks
when
it
's
a
still
night
.
I
peeped
*NL*
out
through
the
willow
branches
,
and
there
it
was
--
a
skiff
,
away
*NL*
across
the
water
.
I
could
n't
tell
how
many
was
in
it
.
It
kept
*NL*
a-coming
,
and
when
it
was
abreast
of
me
I
see
there
war
n't
but
one
man
*NL*
in
it
.
Thinks
I
,
maybe
it
's
pap
,
though
I
war
n't
expecting
him
.
He
*NL*
dropped
below
me
with
the
current
,
and
by
and
by
he
came
a-swinging
up
*NL*
shore
in
the
easy
water
,
and
he
went
by
so
close
I
could
`
a
'
reached
*NL*
out
the
gun
and
touched
him
.
Well
,
it
_
was
_
pap
,
sure
enough
--
and
*NL*
sober
,
too
,
by
the
way
he
laid
his
oars
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
n't
lose
no
time
.
The
next
minute
I
was
a-spinning
down-stream
*NL*
soft
,
but
quick
,
in
the
shade
of
the
bank
.
I
made
two
mile
and
a
half
,
*NL*
and
then
struck
out
a
quarter
of
a
mile
or
more
toward
the
middle
of
*NL*
the
river
,
because
pretty
soon
I
would
be
passing
the
ferry-landing
,
*NL*
and
people
might
see
me
and
hail
me
.
I
got
out
amongst
the
driftwood
,
*NL*
and
then
laid
down
in
the
bottom
of
the
canoe
and
let
her
float
.
I
*NL*
laid
there
,
and
had
a
good
rest
and
a
smoke
out
of
my
pipe
,
looking
*NL*
away
into
the
sky
;
not
a
cloud
in
it
.
The
sky
looks
ever
so
deep
when
*NL*
you
lay
down
on
your
back
in
the
moonshine
;
I
never
knowed
it
before
.
*NL*
And
how
far
a
body
can
hear
on
the
water
such
nights
!
I
heard
people
*NL*
talking
at
the
ferry-landing
.
I
heard
what
they
said
,
too
--
every
word
*NL*
of
it
.
One
man
said
it
was
getting
towards
the
long
days
and
the
short
*NL*
nights
now
.
T'other
one
said
_
this
_
war
n't
one
of
the
short
ones
,
he
*NL*
reckoned
--
and
then
they
laughed
,
and
he
said
it
over
again
,
and
they
*NL*
laughed
again
;
then
they
waked
up
another
fellow
and
told
him
,
and
*NL*
laughed
,
but
he
did
n't
laugh
;
he
ripped
out
something
brisk
,
and
said
*NL*
let
him
alone
.
The
first
fellow
said
he
`
lowed
to
tell
it
to
his
old
*NL*
woman
--
she
would
think
it
was
pretty
good
;
but
he
said
that
war
n't
*NL*
nothing
to
some
things
he
had
said
in
his
time
.
I
heard
one
man
say
it
*NL*
was
nearly
three
o'clock
,
and
he
hoped
daylight
would
n't
wait
more
*NL*
than
about
a
week
longer
.
After
that
the
talk
got
further
and
further
*NL*
away
,
and
I
could
n't
make
out
the
words
any
more
;
but
I
could
hear
the
*NL*
mumble
,
and
now
and
then
a
laugh
,
too
,
but
it
seemed
a
long
ways
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
away
below
the
ferry
now
.
I
rose
up
,
and
there
was
Jackson
's
*NL*
Island
,
about
two
mile
and
a
half
down-stream
,
heavy-timbered
and
*NL*
standing
up
out
of
the
middle
of
the
river
,
big
and
dark
and
solid
,
*NL*
like
a
steamboat
without
any
lights
.
There
war
n't
any
signs
of
the
bar
*NL*
at
the
head
--
it
was
all
under
water
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
did
n't
take
me
long
to
get
there
.
I
shot
past
the
head
at
a
ripping
*NL*
rate
,
the
current
was
so
swift
,
and
then
I
got
into
the
dead
water
and
*NL*
landed
on
the
side
towards
the
Illinois
shore
.
I
run
the
canoe
into
a
*NL*
deep
dent
in
the
bank
that
I
knowed
about
;
I
had
to
part
the
willow
*NL*
branches
to
get
in
;
and
when
I
made
fast
nobody
could
`
a
'
seen
the
*NL*
canoe
from
the
outside
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
up
and
set
down
on
a
log
at
the
head
of
the
island
,
and
looked
*NL*
out
on
the
big
river
and
the
black
driftwood
and
away
over
to
the
*NL*
town
,
three
mile
away
,
where
there
was
three
or
four
lights
twinkling
.
*NL*
A
monstrous
big
lumber-raft
was
about
a
mile
upstream
,
coming
along
*NL*
down
,
with
a
lantern
in
the
middle
of
it
.
I
watched
it
come
creeping
*NL*
down
,
and
when
it
was
most
abreast
of
where
I
stood
I
heard
a
man
say
,
*NL*
``
Stern
oars
,
there
!
heave
her
head
to
stabboard
!
''
I
heard
that
just
as
*NL*
plain
as
if
the
man
was
by
my
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
little
gray
in
the
sky
now
;
so
I
stepped
into
the
woods
,
*NL*
and
laid
down
for
a
nap
before
breakfast
.

CHAPTER
VIII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
was
up
so
high
when
I
waked
that
I
judged
it
was
after
eight
*NL*
o'clock
.
I
laid
there
in
the
grass
and
the
cool
shade
thinking
about
*NL*
things
,
and
feeling
rested
and
ruther
comfortable
and
satisfied
.
I
*NL*
could
see
the
sun
out
at
one
or
two
holes
,
but
mostly
it
was
big
trees
*NL*
all
about
,
and
gloomy
in
there
amongst
them
.
There
was
freckled
places
*NL*
on
the
ground
where
the
light
sifted
down
through
the
leaves
,
and
the
*NL*
freckled
places
swapped
about
a
little
,
showing
there
was
a
little
*NL*
breeze
up
there
.
A
couple
of
squirrels
set
on
a
limb
and
jabbered
at
*NL*
me
very
friendly
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
powerful
lazy
and
comfortable
--
did
n't
want
to
get
up
and
cook
*NL*
breakfast
.
Well
,
I
was
dozing
off
again
when
I
thinks
I
hears
a
deep
*NL*
sound
of
``
boom
!
''
away
up
the
river
.
I
rouses
up
,
and
rests
on
my
elbow
*NL*
and
listens
;
pretty
soon
I
hears
it
again
.
I
hopped
up
,
and
went
and
*NL*
looked
out
at
a
hole
in
the
leaves
,
and
I
see
a
bunch
of
smoke
laying
*NL*
on
the
water
a
long
ways
up
--
about
abreast
the
ferry
.
And
there
was
*NL*
the
ferryboat
full
of
people
floating
along
down
.
I
knowed
what
was
*NL*
the
matter
now
.
``
Boom
!
''
I
see
the
white
smoke
squirt
out
of
the
*NL*
ferryboat
's
side
.
You
see
,
they
was
firing
cannon
over
the
water
,
*NL*
trying
to
make
my
carcass
come
to
the
top
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
pretty
hungry
,
but
it
war
n't
going
to
do
for
me
to
start
a
fire
,
*NL*
because
they
might
see
the
smoke
.
So
I
set
there
and
watched
the
*NL*
cannon-smoke
and
listened
to
the
boom
.
The
river
was
a
mile
wide
*NL*
there
,
and
it
always
looks
pretty
on
a
summer
morning
--
so
I
was
having
*NL*
a
good
enough
time
seeing
them
hunt
for
my
remainders
if
I
only
had
a
*NL*
bite
to
eat
.
Well
,
then
I
happened
to
think
how
they
always
put
*NL*
quicksilver
in
loaves
of
bread
and
float
them
off
,
because
they
always
*NL*
go
right
to
the
drownded
carcass
and
stop
there
.
So
,
says
I
,
I
'll
keep
*NL*
a
lookout
,
and
if
any
of
them
's
floating
around
after
me
I
'll
give
*NL*
them
a
show
.
I
changed
to
the
Illinois
edge
of
the
island
to
see
what
*NL*
luck
I
could
have
,
and
I
war
n't
disappointed
.
A
big
double
loaf
come
*NL*
along
,
and
I
most
got
it
with
a
long
stick
,
but
my
foot
slipped
and
*NL*
she
floated
out
further
.
Of
course
I
was
where
the
current
set
in
the
*NL*
closest
to
the
shore
--
I
knowed
enough
for
that
.
But
by
and
by
along
*NL*
comes
another
one
,
and
this
time
I
won
.
I
took
out
the
plug
and
shook
*NL*
out
the
little
dab
of
quicksilver
,
and
set
my
teeth
in
.
It
was
*NL*
``
baker
's
bread
''
--
what
the
quality
eat
;
none
of
your
low-down
*NL*
corn-pone
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
got
a
good
place
amongst
the
leaves
,
and
set
there
on
a
log
,
*NL*
munching
the
bread
and
watching
the
ferry-boat
,
and
very
well
*NL*
satisfied
.
And
then
something
struck
me
.
I
says
,
now
I
reckon
the
*NL*
widow
or
the
parson
or
somebody
prayed
that
this
bread
would
find
me
,
*NL*
and
here
it
has
gone
and
done
it
.
So
there
ai
n't
no
doubt
but
there
is
*NL*
something
in
that
thing
--
that
is
,
there
's
something
in
it
when
a
body
*NL*
like
the
widow
or
the
parson
prays
,
but
it
do
n't
work
for
me
,
and
I
*NL*
reckon
it
do
n't
work
for
only
just
the
right
kind
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
lit
a
pipe
and
had
a
good
long
smoke
,
and
went
on
watching
.
The
*NL*
ferryboat
was
floating
with
the
current
,
and
I
allowed
I
'd
have
a
*NL*
chance
to
see
who
was
aboard
when
she
come
along
,
because
she
would
*NL*
come
in
close
,
where
the
bread
did
.
When
she
'd
got
pretty
well
along
*NL*
down
towards
me
,
I
put
out
my
pipe
and
went
to
where
I
fished
out
the
*NL*
bread
,
and
laid
down
behind
a
log
on
the
bank
in
a
little
open
place
.
*NL*
Where
the
log
forked
I
could
peep
through
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
and
by
she
come
along
,
and
she
drifted
in
so
close
that
they
could
*NL*
`
a
'
run
out
a
plank
and
walked
ashore
.
Most
everybody
was
on
the
boat
.
*NL*
Pap
,
and
Judge
Thatcher
,
and
Bessie
Thatcher
,
and
Joe
Harper
,
and
Tom
*NL*
Sawyer
,
and
his
old
Aunt
Polly
,
and
Sid
and
Mary
,
and
plenty
more
.
*NL*
Everybody
was
talking
about
the
murder
,
but
the
captain
broke
in
and
*NL*
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
sharp
,
now
;
the
current
sets
in
the
closest
here
,
and
maybe
he
's
*NL*
washed
ashore
and
got
tangled
amongst
the
brush
at
the
water
's
edge
.
I
*NL*
hope
so
,
anyway
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
n't
hope
so
.
They
all
crowded
up
and
leaned
over
the
rails
,
*NL*
nearly
in
my
face
,
and
kept
still
,
watching
with
all
their
might
.
I
*NL*
could
see
them
first-rate
,
but
they
could
n't
see
me
.
Then
the
captain
*NL*
sung
out
:
``
Stand
away
!
''
and
the
cannon
let
off
such
a
blast
right
*NL*
before
me
that
it
made
me
deef
with
the
noise
and
pretty
near
blind
*NL*
with
the
smoke
,
and
I
judged
I
was
gone
.
If
they
'd
`
a
'
had
some
*NL*
bullets
in
,
I
reckon
they
'd
`
a
'
got
the
corpse
they
was
after
.
Well
,
I
*NL*
see
I
war
n't
hurt
,
thanks
to
goodness
.
The
boat
floated
on
and
went
*NL*
out
of
sight
around
the
shoulder
of
the
island
.
I
could
hear
the
*NL*
booming
now
and
then
,
further
and
further
off
,
and
by
and
by
,
after
an
*NL*
hour
,
I
did
n't
hear
it
no
more
.
The
island
was
three
mile
long
.
I
*NL*
judged
they
had
got
to
the
foot
,
and
was
giving
it
up
.
But
they
did
n't
*NL*
yet
awhile
.
They
turned
around
the
foot
of
the
island
and
started
up
*NL*
the
channel
on
the
Missouri
side
,
under
steam
,
and
booming
once
in
a
*NL*
while
as
they
went
.
I
crossed
over
to
that
side
and
watched
them
.
When
*NL*
they
got
abreast
the
head
of
the
island
they
quit
shooting
and
dropped
*NL*
over
to
the
Missouri
shore
and
went
home
to
the
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
knowed
I
was
all
right
now
.
Nobody
else
would
come
a-hunting
after
*NL*
me
.
I
got
my
traps
out
of
the
canoe
and
made
me
a
nice
camp
in
the
*NL*
thick
woods
.
I
made
a
kind
of
a
tent
out
of
my
blankets
to
put
my
*NL*
things
under
so
the
rain
could
n't
get
at
them
.
I
catched
a
catfish
and
*NL*
haggled
him
open
with
my
saw
,
and
towards
sundown
I
started
my
*NL*
camp-fire
and
had
supper
.
Then
I
set
out
a
line
to
catch
some
fish
for
*NL*
breakfast
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
it
was
dark
I
set
by
my
camp-fire
smoking
,
and
feeling
pretty
*NL*
well
satisfied
;
but
by
and
by
it
got
sort
of
lonesome
,
and
so
I
went
*NL*
and
set
on
the
bank
and
listened
to
the
current
swashing
along
,
and
*NL*
counted
the
stars
and
drift-logs
and
rafts
that
come
down
,
and
then
*NL*
went
to
bed
;
there
ai
n't
no
better
way
to
put
in
time
when
you
are
*NL*
lonesome
;
you
ca
n't
stay
so
,
you
soon
get
over
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
for
three
days
and
nights
.
No
difference
--
just
the
same
thing
.
*NL*
But
the
next
day
I
went
exploring
around
down
through
the
island
.
I
*NL*
was
boss
of
it
;
it
all
belonged
to
me
,
so
to
say
,
and
I
wanted
to
know
*NL*
all
about
it
;
but
mainly
I
wanted
to
put
in
the
time
.
I
found
plenty
*NL*
strawberries
,
ripe
and
prime
;
and
green
summer
grapes
,
and
green
*NL*
razberries
;
and
the
green
blackberries
was
just
beginning
to
show
.
*NL*
They
would
all
come
handy
by
and
by
,
I
judged
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
I
went
fooling
along
in
the
deep
woods
till
I
judged
I
war
n't
*NL*
far
from
the
foot
of
the
island
.
I
had
my
gun
along
,
but
I
had
n't
shot
*NL*
nothing
;
it
was
for
protection
;
thought
I
would
kill
some
game
nigh
*NL*
home
.
About
this
time
I
mighty
near
stepped
on
a
good-sized
snake
,
and
*NL*
it
went
sliding
off
through
the
grass
and
flowers
,
and
I
after
it
,
*NL*
trying
to
get
a
shot
at
it
.
I
clipped
along
,
and
all
of
a
sudden
I
*NL*
bounded
right
on
to
the
ashes
of
a
camp-fire
that
was
still
smoking
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
heart
jumped
up
amongst
my
lungs
.
I
never
waited
for
to
look
*NL*
further
,
but
uncocked
my
gun
and
went
sneaking
back
on
my
tiptoes
as
*NL*
fast
as
ever
I
could
.
Every
now
and
then
I
stopped
a
second
amongst
*NL*
the
thick
leaves
and
listened
,
but
my
breath
come
so
hard
I
could
n't
*NL*
hear
nothing
else
.
I
slunk
along
another
piece
further
,
then
listened
*NL*
again
;
and
so
on
,
and
so
on
.
If
I
see
a
stump
,
I
took
it
for
a
man
;
if
*NL*
I
trod
on
a
stick
and
broke
it
,
it
made
me
feel
like
a
person
had
cut
*NL*
one
of
my
breaths
in
two
and
I
only
got
half
,
and
the
short
half
,
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
got
to
camp
I
war
n't
feeling
very
brash
,
there
war
n't
much
sand
*NL*
in
my
craw
;
but
I
says
,
this
ai
n't
no
time
to
be
fooling
around
.
So
I
*NL*
got
all
my
traps
into
my
canoe
again
so
as
to
have
them
out
of
sight
,
*NL*
and
I
put
out
the
fire
and
scattered
the
ashes
around
to
look
like
an
*NL*
old
last-year
's
camp
,
and
then
clumb
a
tree
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
reckon
I
was
up
in
the
tree
two
hours
;
but
I
did
n't
see
nothing
,
I
*NL*
did
n't
hear
nothing
--
I
only
_
thought
_
I
heard
and
seen
as
much
as
a
*NL*
thousand
things
.
Well
,
I
could
n't
stay
up
there
forever
;
so
at
last
I
*NL*
got
down
,
but
I
kept
in
the
thick
woods
and
on
the
lookout
all
the
*NL*
time
.
All
I
could
get
to
eat
was
berries
and
what
was
left
over
from
*NL*
breakfast
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
time
it
was
night
I
was
pretty
hungry
.
So
when
it
was
good
and
*NL*
dark
I
slid
out
from
shore
before
moonrise
and
paddled
over
to
the
*NL*
Illinois
bank
--
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
.
I
went
out
in
the
woods
and
*NL*
cooked
a
supper
,
and
I
had
about
made
up
my
mind
I
would
stay
there
*NL*
all
night
when
I
hear
a
_
plunkety-plunk
_
,
_
plunkety-plunk
_
,
and
says
*NL*
to
myself
,
horses
coming
;
and
next
I
hear
people
's
voices
.
I
got
*NL*
everything
into
the
canoe
as
quick
as
I
could
,
and
then
went
creeping
*NL*
through
the
woods
to
see
what
I
could
find
out
.
I
had
n't
got
far
when
*NL*
I
hear
a
man
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
better
camp
here
if
we
can
find
a
good
place
;
the
horses
is
about
*NL*
beat
out
.
Let
's
look
around
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
n't
wait
,
but
shoved
out
and
paddled
away
easy
.
I
tied
up
in
the
*NL*
old
place
,
and
reckoned
I
would
sleep
in
the
canoe
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
n't
sleep
much
.
I
could
n't
,
somehow
,
for
thinking
.
And
every
time
*NL*
I
waked
up
I
thought
somebody
had
me
by
the
neck
.
So
the
sleep
did
n't
*NL*
do
me
no
good
.
By
and
by
I
says
to
myself
,
I
ca
n't
live
this
way
;
I
'm
*NL*
a-going
to
find
out
who
it
is
that
's
here
on
the
island
with
me
;
I
'll
*NL*
find
it
out
or
bust
.
Well
,
I
felt
better
right
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
I
took
my
paddle
and
slid
out
from
shore
just
a
step
or
two
,
and
*NL*
then
let
the
canoe
drop
along
down
amongst
the
shadows
.
The
moon
was
*NL*
shining
,
and
outside
of
the
shadows
it
made
it
most
as
light
as
day
.
I
*NL*
poked
along
well
on
to
an
hour
,
everything
still
as
rocks
and
sound
*NL*
asleep
.
Well
,
by
this
time
I
was
most
down
to
the
foot
of
the
island
.
*NL*
A
little
ripply
,
cool
breeze
begun
to
blow
,
and
that
was
as
good
as
*NL*
saying
the
night
was
about
done
.
I
give
her
a
turn
with
the
paddle
and
*NL*
brung
her
nose
to
shore
;
then
I
got
my
gun
and
slipped
out
and
into
*NL*
the
edge
of
the
woods
.
I
sat
down
there
on
a
log
,
and
looked
out
*NL*
through
the
leaves
.
I
see
the
moon
go
off
watch
,
and
the
darkness
*NL*
begin
to
blanket
the
river
.
But
in
a
little
while
I
see
a
pale
streak
*NL*
over
the
treetops
,
and
knowed
the
day
was
coming
.
So
I
took
my
gun
and
*NL*
slipped
off
towards
where
I
had
run
across
that
camp-fire
,
stopping
*NL*
every
minute
or
two
to
listen
.
But
I
had
n't
no
luck
somehow
;
I
*NL*
could
n't
seem
to
find
the
place
.
But
by
and
by
,
sure
enough
,
I
catched
*NL*
a
glimpse
of
fire
away
through
the
trees
.
I
went
for
it
,
cautious
and
*NL*
slow
.
By
and
by
I
was
close
enough
to
have
a
look
,
and
there
laid
a
*NL*
man
on
the
ground
.
It
most
give
me
the
fantods
.
He
had
a
blanket
*NL*
around
his
head
,
and
his
head
was
nearly
in
the
fire
.
I
set
there
*NL*
behind
a
clump
of
bushes
in
about
six
foot
of
him
,
and
kept
my
eyes
on
*NL*
him
steady
.
It
was
getting
gray
daylight
now
.
Pretty
soon
he
gapped
*NL*
and
stretched
himself
and
hove
off
the
blanket
,
and
it
was
Miss
*NL*
Watson
's
Jim
!
I
bet
I
was
glad
to
see
him
.
I
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hello
,
Jim
!
''
and
skipped
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
bounced
up
and
stared
at
me
wild
.
Then
he
drops
down
on
his
knees
,
*NL*
and
puts
his
hands
together
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doan
'
hurt
me
--
do
n't
!
I
hai
n't
ever

no

''
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
I
war
n't
long
making
him
understand
I
war
n't
dead
.
I
was
ever
so
*NL*
glad
to
see
Jim
.
I
war
n't
lonesome
now
.
I
told
him
I
war
n't
afraid
of
*NL*
_
him
_
telling
the
people
where
I
was
.
I
talked
along
,
but
he
only
set
*NL*
there
and
looked
at
me
;
never
said
nothing
.
Then
I
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's

daylight
.
Le

*NL*
*NL*
``

I
says
.
``
Is

''
*NL*
*NL*
``

he
says
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*

*NL*
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
So
we
went
over
to
where
the
canoe
was
,
and
while
he
built
a
fire
in
a
*NL*
grassy
open
place
amongst
the
trees
,
I
fetched
meal
and
bacon
and
*NL*
coffee
,
and
coffee-pot
and
frying-pan
,
and
sugar
and
tin
cups
,
and
the
*NL*
nigger
was
set
back
considerable
,
because
he
reckoned
it
was
all
done
*NL*
with
witchcraft
.
I
catched
a
good
big
catfish
,
too
,
and
Jim
cleaned
*NL*
him
with
his
knife
,
and
fried
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
breakfast
was
ready
we
lolled
on
the
grass
and
eat
it
smoking
*NL*
hot
.
Jim
laid
it
in
with
all
his
might
,
for
he
was
most
about
starved
.
*NL*
Then
when
we
had
got
pretty
well
stuffed
,
we
laid
off
and
lazied
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
and
by
Jim
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
looky
here
,
Huck
,
who

it

''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
I
told
him
the
whole
thing
,
and
he
said
it
was
smart
.
He
said
Tom
*NL*
Sawyer
could
n't
get
up
no
better
plan
than
what
I
had
.
Then
I
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
come
to
be
here
,
Jim
,
and
how
'd
you
get

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
pretty
uneasy
,
and
did
n't
say
nothing
for
a
minute
.
Then
he
*NL*
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maybe
I
better
not
tell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Jim
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

Some

Jim

it
was

it

He

it
was

a
sign
when
young

flew

so
he
reckoned
it
was
*NL*
the

way
when
young
birds
done
it

I
was
going
to
catch
some
of
*NL*
them
,
but
Jim
would
n't
let
me
.
He
said
it
was
death

He
said
his
*NL*
father
laid
mighty
sick
once

and
some
of
them
catched
a
bird
,
and
his
*NL*
old
granny
said
his
father
would
die

he
did

Jim
said
you
must
n't
count
the
things
you
are
going

cook
for

dinner
,
because
that
would
bring
bad
luck

The
same
if
you
shook
the

tablecloth
after

And
he
said
if
a
man
owned
a
beehive
and
*NL*
that
man
died
,
the
bees
must
be
told
about
it
before
sun-up
next
*NL*
morning
,
or
else
the
bees
would
all
weaken
down
and
quit
work
and
die
.
*NL*
Jim
said
bees
would
n't
sting
idiots
;
but
I
did
n't
believe
that
,
*NL*
because
I
had
tried
them
lots
of
times
myself

they
would
n't
sting
*NL*
me

*NL*
I

heard
about

CHAPTER
IX
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
wanted
to
go
and
look
at
a
place
right
about
the
middle
of
the
*NL*
island
that
I
'd
found
when
I
was
exploring
;
so
we
started
and
soon
got
*NL*
to
it
,
because
the
island
was
only
three
miles
long
and
a
quarter
of
a
*NL*
mile
wide
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
place
was
a
tolerable
long
,
steep
hill
or
ridge
about
forty
foot
*NL*
high
.
We
had
a
rough
time
getting
to
the
top
,
the
sides
was
so
steep
*NL*
and
the
bushes
so
thick
.
We
tramped
and
clumb
around
all
over
it
,
and
*NL*
by
and
by
found
a
good
big
cavern
in
the
rock
,
most
up
to
the
top
on
*NL*
the
side
towards
Illinois
.
The
cavern
was
as
big
as
two
or
three
rooms
*NL*
bunched
together
,
and
Jim
could
stand
up
straight
in
it
.
It
was
cool
*NL*
in
there
.
Jim
was
for
putting
our
traps
in
there
right
away
,
but
I
*NL*
said
we
did
n't
want
to
be
climbing
up
and
down
there
all
the
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jim
said
if
we
had
the
canoe
hid
in
a
good
place
,
and
had
all
the
*NL*
traps
in
the
cavern
,
we
could
rush
there
if
anybody
was
to
come
to
the
*NL*
island
,
and
they
would
never
find
us
without
dogs
.
And
,
besides
,
he
*NL*
said
them
little
birds
had
said
it
was
going
to
rain
,
and
did
I
want
*NL*
the
things
to
get
wet
?
*NL*
*NL*
So
we
went
back
and
got
the
canoe
,
and
paddled
up
abreast
the
cavern
,
*NL*
and
lugged
all
the
traps
up
there
.
Then
we
hunted
up
a
place
close
by
*NL*
to
hide
the
canoe
in
,
amongst
the
thick
willows
.
We
took
some
fish
off
*NL*
of
the
lines
and
set
them
again
,
and
begun
to
get
ready
for
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
of
the
cavern
was
big
enough
to
roll
a
hogshead
in
,
and
on
*NL*
one
side
of
the
door
the
floor
stuck
out
a
little
bit
,
and
was
flat
*NL*
and
a
good
place
to
build
a
fire
on
.
So
we
built
it
there
and
cooked
*NL*
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
spread
the
blankets
inside
for
a
carpet
,
and
eat
our
dinner
in
*NL*
there
.
We
put
all
the
other
things
handy
at
the
back
of
the
cavern
.
*NL*
Pretty
soon
it
darkened
up
,
and
begun
to
thunder
and
lighten
;
so
the
*NL*
birds
was
right
about
it
.
Directly
it
begun
to
rain
,
and
it
rained
*NL*
like
all
fury
,
too
,
and
I
never
see
the
wind
blow
so
.
It
was
one
of
*NL*
these
regular
summer
storms
.
It
would
get
so
dark
that
it
looked
all
*NL*
blue-black
outside
,
and
lovely
;
and
the
rain
would
thrash
along
by
so
*NL*
thick
that
the
trees
off
a
little
ways
looked
dim
and
spider-webby
;
*NL*
and
here
would
come
a
blast
of
wind
that
would
bend
the
trees
down
and
*NL*
turn
up
the
pale
underside
of
the
leaves
;
and
then
a
perfect
ripper
of
*NL*
a
gust
would
follow
along
and
set
the
branches
to
tossing
their
arms
*NL*
as
if
they
was
just
wild
;
and
next
,
when
it
was
just
about
the
bluest
*NL*
and
blackest
--
_
fst
!
_
it
was
as
bright
as
glory
,
and
you
'd
have
a
*NL*
little
glimpse
of
tree-tops
a-plunging
about
away
off
yonder
in
the
*NL*
storm
,
hundreds
of
yards
further
than
you
could
see
before
;
dark
as
*NL*
sin
again
in
a
second
,
and
now
you
'd
hear
the
thunder
let
go
with
an
*NL*
awful
crash
,
and
then
go
rumbling
,
grumbling
,
tumbling
,
down
the
sky
*NL*
towards
the
under
side
of
the
world
,
like
rolling
empty
barrels
*NL*
down-stairs
--
where
it
's
long
stairs
and
they
bounce
a
good
deal
,
you
*NL*
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jim
,
this
is
nice

I
says
.
``
I
would
n't
want
to
be
nowhere
else
but
*NL*

.
Pass

along
another
hunk
of

some
hot
corn-bread

*NL*
*NL*
The
river
went
on
raising
and
raising
for
ten
or
twelve
days
,
till
at
*NL*
last
it
was
over
the
banks
.
The
water
was
three
or
four
foot
deep
on
*NL*
the
island
in
the
low
places
and
on
the
Illinois
bottom
.
On
that
side
*NL*
it
was
a
good
many
miles
wide
,
but
on
the
Missouri
side
it
was
the
*NL*
same
old
distance
across
--
a
half
a
mile
--
because
the
Missouri
shore
*NL*
was
just
a
wall
of
high
bluffs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Daytimes
we
paddled
all
over
the
island
in
the
canoe
.
It
was
mighty
*NL*
cool
and
shady
in
the
deep
woods
,
even
if
the
sun
was
blazing
outside
.
*NL*
We
went
winding
in
and
out
amongst
the
trees
,
and
sometimes
the
vines
*NL*
hung
so
thick
we
had
to
back
away
and
go
some
other
way
.
Well
,
on
*NL*
every
old
broken-down
tree
you
could
see
rabbits
and
snakes
and
such
*NL*
things
;
and
when
the
island
had
been
overflowed
a
day
or
two
they
got
*NL*
so
tame
,
on
account
of
being
hungry
,
that
you
could
paddle
right
up
*NL*
and
put
your
hand
on
them
if
you
wanted
to
;
but
not
the
snakes
and
*NL*
turtles
--
they
would
slide
off
in
the
water
.
The
ridge
our
cavern
was
*NL*
in
was
full
of
them
.
We
could
`
a
'
had
pets
enough
if
we
'd
wanted
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
night
we
catched
a
little
section
of
a
lumber-raft
--
nice
pine
*NL*
planks
.
It
was
twelve
foot
wide
and
about
fifteen
or
sixteen
foot
*NL*
long
,
and
the
top
stood
above
water
six
or
seven
inches
--
a
solid
,
*NL*
level
floor
.
We
could
see
saw-logs
go
by
in
the
daylight
sometimes
,
*NL*
but
we
let
them
go
;
we
did
n't
show
ourselves
in
daylight
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
night
when
we
was
up
at
the
head
of
the
island
,
just
before
*NL*
daylight
,
here
comes
a
frame-house
down
,
on
the
west
side
.
She
was
a
*NL*
two-story
,
and
tilted
over
considerable
.
We
paddled
out
and
got
*NL*
aboard
--
clumb
in
at
an
up-stairs
window
.
But
it
was
too
dark
to
see
*NL*
yet
,
so
we
made
the
canoe
fast
and
set
in
her
to
wait
for
daylight
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
light
begun
to
come
before
we
got
to
the
foot
of
the
island
.
Then
*NL*
we
looked
in
at
the
window
.
We
could
make
out
a
bed
,
and
a
table
,
and
*NL*
two
old
chairs
,
and
lots
of
things
around
about
on
the
floor
,
and
*NL*
there
was
clothes
hanging
against
the
wall
.
There
was
something
laying
*NL*
on
the
floor
in
the
far
corner
that
looked
like
a
man
.
So
Jim
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hello
,
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
did
n't
budge
.
So
I
hollered
again
,
and
then
Jim
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
De
man
ai
n't
asleep
--
he
's
dead
.
You
hold
still
--
I
'll
go
en
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
,
and
bent
down
and
looked
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
dead
man
.
Yes
,
indeedy
;
naked
,
too
.
He
's
ben
shot
in
de
back
.
*NL*
I
reck
'n
he
's
ben
dead
two
er
three
days
.
Come
in
,
Huck
,
but
doan
'
*NL*
look
at
his
face
--
it
's
too
gashly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
n't
look
at
him
at
all
.
Jim
throwed
some
old
rags
over
him
,
but
*NL*
he
need
n't
done
it
;
I
did
n't
want
to
see
him
.
There
was
heaps
of
old
*NL*
greasy
cards
scattered
around
over
the
floor
,
and
old
whisky-bottles
,
*NL*
and
a
couple
of
masks
made
out
of
black
cloth
;
and
all
over
the
walls
*NL*
was
the
ignorantest
kind
of
words
and
pictures
made
with
charcoal
.
*NL*
There
was
two
old
dirty
calico
dresses
,
and
a
sun-bonnet
,
and
some
*NL*
women
's
underclothes
hanging
against
the
wall
,
and
some
men
's
*NL*
clothing
,
too
.
We
put
the
lot
into
the
canoe
--
it
might
come
good
.
*NL*
There
was
a
boy
's
old
speckled
straw
hat
on
the
floor
;
I
took
that
,
*NL*
too
.
And
there
was
a
bottle
that
had
had
milk
in
it
,
and
it
had
a
rag
*NL*
stopper
for
a
baby
to
suck
.
We
would
`
a
'
took
the
bottle
,
but
it
was
*NL*
broke
.
There
was
a
seedy
old
chest
,
and
an
old
hair
trunk
with
the
*NL*
hinges
broke
.
They
stood
open
,
but
there
war
n't
nothing
left
in
them
*NL*
that
was
any
account
.
The
way
things
was
scattered
about
we
reckoned
*NL*
the
people
left
in
a
hurry
,
and
war
n't
fixed
so
as
to
carry
off
most
*NL*
of
their
stuff
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
got
an
old
tin
lantern
,
and
a
butcher-knife
without
any
handle
,
and
*NL*
a
bran-new
Barlow
knife
worth
two
bits
in
any
store
,
and
a
lot
of
*NL*
tallow
candles
,
and
a
tin
candlestick
,
and
a
gourd
,
and
a
tin
cup
,
and
*NL*
a
ratty
old
bedquilt
off
the
bed
,
and
a
reticule
with
needles
and
pins
*NL*
and
beeswax
and
buttons
and
thread
and
all
such
truck
in
it
,
and
a
*NL*
hatchet
and
some
nails
,
and
a
fish-line
as
thick
as
my
little
finger
*NL*
with
some
monstrous
hooks
on
it
,
and
a
roll
of
buckskin
,
and
a
leather
*NL*
dog-collar
,
and
a
horseshoe
,
and
some
vials
of
medicine
that
did
n't
*NL*
have
no
label
on
them
;
and
just
as
we
was
leaving
I
found
a
tolerable
*NL*
good
currycomb
,
and
Jim
he
found
a
ratty
old
fiddle-bow
,
and
a
wooden
*NL*
leg
.
The
straps
was
broke
off
of
it
,
but
,
barring
that
,
it
was
a
good
*NL*
enough
leg
,
though
it
was
too
long
for
me
and
not
long
enough
for
Jim
,
*NL*
and
we
could
n't
find
the
other
one
,
though
we
hunted
all
around
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
,
take
it
all
around
,
we
made
a
good
haul
.
When
we
was
ready
to
*NL*
shove
off
we
was
a
quarter
of
a
mile
below
the
island
,
and
it
was
*NL*
pretty
broad
day
;
so
I
made
Jim
lay
down
in
the
canoe
and
cover
up
*NL*
with
the
quilt
,
because
if
he
set
up
people
could
tell
he
was
a
nigger
*NL*
a
good
ways
off
.
I
paddled
over
to
the
Illinois
shore
,
and
drifted
*NL*
down
most
a
half
a
mile
doing
it
.
I
crept
up
the
dead
water
under
the
*NL*
bank
,
and
had
n't
no
accidents
and
did
n't
see
nobody
.
We
got
home
all
*NL*
safe
.

CHAPTER
X
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
After
breakfast
I
wanted
to
talk
about
the
dead
man
and
guess
out
how
*NL*
he
come
to
be
killed
,
but
Jim
did
n't
want
to
.
He
said
it
would
fetch
*NL*
bad
luck
;
and
besides
,
he
said
,
he
might
come
and
ha
`
nt
us
;
he
said
a
*NL*
man
that
war
n't
buried
was
more
likely
to
go
a-ha
`
nting
around
than
*NL*
one
that
was
planted
and
comfortable
.
That
sounded
pretty
reasonable
,
*NL*
so
I
did
n't
say
no
more
;
but
I
could
n't
keep
from
studying
over
it
and
*NL*
wishing
I
knowed
who
shot
the
man
,
and
what
they
done
it
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
rummaged
the
clothes
we
'd
got
,
and
found
eight
dollars
in
silver
*NL*
sewed
up
in
the
lining
of
an
old
blanket
overcoat
.
Jim
said
he
*NL*
reckoned
the
people
in
that
house
stole
the
coat
,
because
if
they
'd
*NL*
`
a
'
knowed
the
money
was
there
they
would
n't
`
a
'
left
it
.
I
said
I
*NL*
reckoned
they
killed
him
,
too
;
but
Jim
did
n't
want
to
talk
about
that
.
*NL*
I
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
you
think
it
's
bad
luck
;
but
what
did
you
say
when
I
fetched
in
*NL*
the
snake-skin
that
I
found
on
the
top
of
the
ridge
day
before
*NL*
yesterday
?
You
said
it
was
the
worst
bad
luck
in
the
world
to
touch
a
*NL*
snake-skin
with
my
hands
.
Well
,
here
's
your
bad
luck
!
We
've
raked
in
*NL*
all
this
truck
and
eight
dollars
besides
.
I
wish
we
could
have
some
*NL*
bad
luck
like
this
every
day

Mind
I

it

''
*NL*
*NL*
It
did
come
,
too
.
It
was
a
Tuesday
that
we
had
that
talk
.
Well
,
after
*NL*
dinner
Friday
we
was
laying
around
in
the
grass
at
the
upper
end
of
*NL*
the
ridge
,
and
got
out
of
tobacco
.
I
went
to
the
cavern
to
get
some
,
*NL*
and
found
a
rattlesnake
in
there
.
I
killed
him
,
and
curled
him
up
on
*NL*
the
foot
of
Jim
's
blanket
,
ever
so
natural
,
thinking
there
'd
be
some
*NL*
fun
when
Jim
found
him
there
.
Well
,
by
night
I
forgot
all
about
the
*NL*
snake
,
and
when
Jim
flung
himself
down
on
the
blanket
while
I
struck
a
*NL*
light
the
snake
's
mate
was
there
,
and
bit
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
jumped
up
yelling
,
and
the
first
thing
the
light
showed
was
the
*NL*
varmint
curled
up
and
ready
for
another
spring
.
I
laid
him
out
in
a
*NL*
second
with
a
stick
,
and
Jim
grabbed
pap
's
whisky-jug
and
begun
to
*NL*
pour
it
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
barefooted
,
and
the
snake
bit
him
right
on
the
heel
.
That
all
*NL*
comes
of
my
being
such
a
fool
as
to
not
remember
that
wherever
you
*NL*
leave
a
dead
snake
its
mate
always
comes
there
and
curls
around
it
.
*NL*
Jim
told
me
to
chop
off
the
snake
's
head
and
throw
it
away
,
and
then
*NL*
skin
the
body
and
roast
a
piece
of
it
.
I
done
it
,
and
he
eat
it
and
*NL*
said
it
would
help
cure
him
.
He
made
me
take
off
the
rattles
and
tie
*NL*
them
around
his
wrist
,
too
.
He
said
that
that
would
help
.
Then
I
slid
*NL*
out
quiet
and
throwed
the
snakes
clear
away
amongst
the
bushes
;
for
I
*NL*
war
n't
going
to
let
Jim
find
out
it
was
all
my
fault
,
not
if
I
could
*NL*
help
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jim
sucked
and
sucked
at
the
jug
,
and
now
and
then
he
got
out
of
his
*NL*
head
and
pitched
around
and
yelled
;
but
every
time
he
come
to
himself
*NL*
he
went
to
sucking
at
the
jug
again
.
His
foot
swelled
up
pretty
big
,
*NL*
and
so
did
his
leg
;
but
by
and
by
the
drunk
begun
to
come
,
and
so
I
*NL*
judged
he
was
all
right
;
but
I
'd
druther
been
bit
with
a
snake
than
*NL*
pap
's
whisky
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jim
was
laid
up
for
four
days
and
nights
.
Then
the
swelling
was
all
*NL*
gone
and
he
was
around
again
.
I
made
up
my
mind
I
would
n't
ever
take
*NL*
a-holt
of
a
snake-skin
again
with
my
hands
,
now
that
I
see
what
had
*NL*
come
of
it
.
Jim
said
he
reckoned
I
would
believe
him
next
time
.
And
he
*NL*
said
that
handling
a
snake-skin
was
such
awful
bad
luck
that
maybe
we
*NL*
had
n't
got
to
the
end
of
it
yet
.
He
said
he
druther
see
the
new
moon
*NL*
over
his
left
shoulder
as
much
as
a
thousand
times
than
take
up
a
*NL*
snake-skin
in
his
hand
.
Well
,
I
was
getting
to
feel
that
way
myself
,
*NL*
though
I
've
always
reckoned
that
looking
at
the
new
moon
over
your
*NL*
left
shoulder
is
one
of
the
carelessest
and
foolishest
things
a
body
*NL*
can
do
.
Old
Hank
Bunker
done
it
once
,
and
bragged
about
it
;
and
in
*NL*
less
than
two
years
he
got
drunk
and
fell
off
of
the
shot-tower
,
and
*NL*
spread
himself
out
so
that
he
was
just
a
kind
of
a
layer
,
as
you
may
*NL*
say
;
and
they
slid
him
edgeways
between
two
barn
doors
for
a
coffin
,
*NL*
and
buried
him
so
,
so
they
say
,
but
I
did
n't
see
it
.
Pap
told
me
.
But
*NL*
anyway
it
all
come
of
looking
at
the
moon
that
way
,
like
a
fool
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
the
days
went
along
,
and
the
river
went
down
between
its
banks
*NL*
again
;
and
about
the
first
thing
we
done
was
to
bait
one
of
the
big
*NL*
hooks
with
a
skinned
rabbit
and
set
it
and
catch
a
catfish
that
was
as
*NL*
big
as
a
man
,
being
six
foot
two
inches
long
,
and
weighed
over
two
*NL*
hundred
pounds
.
We
could
n't
handle
him
,
of
course
;
he
would
`
a
'
flung
*NL*
us
into
Illinois
.
We
just
set
there
and
watched
him
rip
and
tear
*NL*
around
till
he
drownded
.
We
found
a
brass
button
in
his
stomach
and
a
*NL*
round
ball
,
and
lots
of
rubbage
.
We
split
the
ball
open
with
the
*NL*
hatchet
,
and
there
was
a
spool
in
it
.
Jim
said
he
'd
had
it
there
a
*NL*
long
time
,
to
coat
it
over
so
and
make
a
ball
of
it
.
It
was
as
big
a
*NL*
fish
as
was
ever
catched
in
the
Mississippi
,
I
reckon
.
Jim
said
he
*NL*
had
n't
ever
seen
a
bigger
one
.
He
would
`
a
'
been
worth
a
good
deal
*NL*
over
at
the
village
.
They
peddle
out
such
a
fish
as
that
by
the
pound
*NL*
in
the
market-house
there
;
everybody
buys
some
of
him
;
his
meat
's
as
*NL*
white
as
snow
and
makes
a
good
fry
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
morning
I
said
it
was
getting
slow
and
dull
,
and
I
wanted
to
get
*NL*
a
stirring-up
some
way
.
I
said
I
reckoned
I
would
slip
over
the
river
*NL*
and
find
out
what
was
going
on
.
Jim
liked
that
notion
;
but
he
said
I
*NL*
must
go
in
the
dark
and
look
sharp
.
Then
he
studied
it
over
and
said
,
*NL*
could
n't
I
put
on
some
of
them
old
things
and
dress
up
like
a
girl
?
*NL*
That
was
a
good
notion
,
too
.
So
we
shortened
up
one
of
the
calico
*NL*
gowns
,
and
I
turned
up
my
trouser-legs
to
my
knees
and
got
into
it
.
*NL*
Jim
hitched
it
behind
with
the
hooks
,
and
it
was
a
fair
fit
.
I
put
on
*NL*
the
sun-bonnet
and
tied
it
under
my
chin
,
and
then
for
a
body
to
look
*NL*
in
and
see
my
face
was
like
looking
down
a
joint
of
stove-pipe
.
Jim
*NL*
said
nobody
would
know
me
,
even
in
the
daytime
,
hardly
.
I
practised
*NL*
around
all
day
to
get
the
hang
of
the
things
,
and
by
and
by
I
could
do
*NL*
pretty
well
in
them
,
only
Jim
said
I
did
n't
walk
like
a
girl
;
and
he
*NL*
said
I
must
quit
pulling
up
my
gown
to
get
at
my
britches-pocket
.
I
*NL*
took
notice
,
and
done
better
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
started
up
the
Illinois
shore
in
the
canoe
just
after
dark
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
started
across
to
the
town
from
a
little
below
the
ferry-landing
,
*NL*
and
the
drift
of
the
current
fetched
me
in
at
the
bottom
of
the
town
.
*NL*
I
tied
up
and
started
along
the
bank
.
There
was
a
light
burning
in
a
*NL*
little
shanty
that
had
n't
been
lived
in
for
a
long
time
,
and
I
*NL*
wondered
who
had
took
up
quarters
there
.
I
slipped
up
and
peeped
in
at
*NL*
the
window
.
There
was
a
woman
about
forty
year
old
in
there
knitting
*NL*
by
a
candle
that
was
on
a
pine
table
.
I
did
n't
know
her
face
;
she
was
*NL*
a
stranger
,
for
you
could
n't
start
a
face
in
that
town
that
I
did
n't
*NL*
know
.
Now
this
was
lucky
,
because
I
was
weakening
;
I
was
getting
*NL*
afraid
I
had
come
;
people
might
know
my
voice
and
find
me
out
.
But
if
*NL*
this
woman
had
been
in
such
a
little
town
two
days
she
could
tell
me
*NL*
all
I
wanted
to
know
;
so
I
knocked
at
the
door
,
and
made
up
my
mind
I
*NL*
would
n't
forget
I
was
a
girl
.

CHAPTER
XI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
in
,
''
says
the
woman
,
and
I
did
.
She
says
:
``
Take
a
cheer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
done
it
.
She
looked
me
all
over
with
her
little
shiny
eyes
,
and
*NL*
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
might
your
name
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sarah
Williams
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
`
bouts
do
you
live
?
In
this
neighborhood
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
'm
.
In
Hookerville
,
seven
mile
below
.
I
've
walked
all
the
way
and
*NL*
I
'm
all
tired
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hungry
,
too
,
I
reckon
.
I
'll
find
you
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
'm
,
I
ai
n't
hungry
.
I
was
so
hungry
I
had
to
stop
two
miles
below
*NL*
here
at
a
farm
;
so
I
ai
n't
hungry
no
more
.
It
's
what
makes
me
so
late
.
*NL*
My
mother
's
down
sick
,
and
out
of
money
and
everything
,
and
I
come
to
*NL*
tell
my
uncle
Abner
Moore
.
He
lives
at
the
upper
end
of
the
town
,
she
*NL*
says
.
I
hai
n't
ever
been
here
before
.
Do
you
know
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
but
I
do
n't
know
everybody
yet
.
I
have
n't
lived
here
quite
two
*NL*
weeks
.
It
's
a
considerable
ways
to
the
upper
end
of
the
town
.
You
*NL*
better
stay
here
all
night
.
Take
off
your
bonnet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
I
says
;
``
I
'll
rest
awhile
,
I
reckon
,
and
go
on
.
I
ai
n't
afeard
*NL*
of
the
dark
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
said
she
would
n't
let
me
go
by
myself
,
but
her
husband
would
be
in
*NL*
by
and
by
,
maybe
in
a
hour
and
a
half
,
and
she
'd
send
him
along
with
*NL*
me
.
Then
she
got
to
talking
about
her
husband
,
and
about
her
relations
*NL*
up
the
river
,
and
her
relations
down
the
river
,
and
about
how
much
*NL*
better
off
they
used
to
was
,
and
how
they
did
n't
know
but
they
'd
made
*NL*
a
mistake
coming
to
our
town
,
instead
of
letting
well
alone
--
and
so
on
*NL*
and
so
on
,
till
I
was
afeard
I
had
made
a
mistake
coming
to
her
to
*NL*
find
out
what
was
going
on
in
the
town
;
but
by
and
by
she
dropped
on
*NL*
to
pap
and
the
murder
,
and
then
I
was
pretty
willing
to
let
her
*NL*
clatter
right
along
.
She
told
about
me
and
Tom
Sawyer
finding
the
*NL*
twelve
thousand
dollars
-LRB-
only
she
got
it
twenty
-RRB-
and
all
about
pap
and
*NL*
what
a
hard
lot
he
was
,
and
what
a
hard
lot
I
was
,
and
at
last
she
got
*NL*
down
to
where
I
was
murdered
.
I
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
done
it
?
We
've
heard
considerable
about
these
goings-on
down
in
*NL*
Hookerville
,
but
we
do
n't
know
who
't
was
that
killed
Huck
Finn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
reckon
there
's
a
right
smart
chance
of
people

here

that

*NL*
like
to
know
who
killed
him

Some
think

Finn
done
it
himself

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

is
that
so
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Most
everybody
thought
it
at
first
.
He
'll
never
know
how
nigh
he
come
*NL*
to
getting
lynched
.
But
before
night
they
changed
around
and
judged
it
*NL*
was
done
by
a
runaway
nigger
named
Jim
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
_
he
_
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
stopped
.
I
reckoned
I
better
keep
still
.
She
run
on
,
and
never
*NL*
noticed
I
had
put
in
at
all
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
nigger
run
off
the
very
night
Huck
Finn
was
killed

So
there
's
a
*NL*
reward
out
for
him
--
three
hundred
dollars
.
And
there
's
a
reward
out
*NL*
for
old
Finn
,
too
--
two
hundred
dollars
.
You
see
,
he
come
to
town
the
*NL*
morning
after
the
murder
,
and
told
about
it
,
and
was
out
with
'em
on
*NL*
the
ferryboat
hunt
,
and
right
away
after
he
up
and
left
.
Before
night
*NL*
they
wanted
to
lynch
him
,
but
he
was
gone
,
you
see
.
Well
,
next
day
*NL*
they
found
out
the
nigger
was
gone
;
they
found
out
he
had
n't
ben
seen
*NL*
sence
ten
o'clock
the
night
the
murder
was
done
.
So
then
they
put
it
*NL*
on
him
,
you
see
;
and
while
they
was
full
of
it
,
next
day
,
back
comes
*NL*
old
Finn
,
and
went
boo-hooing
to
Judge
Thatcher
to
get
money
to
hunt
*NL*
for
the
nigger
all
over
Illinois
with
.
The
judge
gave
him
some
,
and
*NL*
that
evening
he
got
drunk
,
and
was
around
till
after
midnight
with
a
*NL*
couple
of
mighty
hard-looking
strangers
,
and
then
went
off
with
them
.
*NL*
Well
,
he
hai
n't
come
back
sence
,
and
they
ai
n't
looking
for
him
back
*NL*
till
this
thing
blows
over
a
little
,
for
people
thinks
now
that
he
*NL*
killed
his
boy
and
fixed
things
so
folks
would
think
robbers
done
it
,
*NL*
and
then
he
'd
get
Huck
's
money
without
having
to
bother
a
long
time
*NL*
with
a
lawsuit
.
People
do
say
he
war
n't
any
too
good
to
do
it
.
Oh
,
*NL*
he
's
sly
,
I
reckon
.
If
he
do
n't
come
back
for
a
year
he
'll
be
all
*NL*
right
.
You
ca
n't
prove
anything
on
him
,
you
know
;
everything
will
be
*NL*
quieted
down
then
,
and
he
'll
walk
in
Huck
's
money
as
easy
as
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
reckon
so
,
'm

I
do
n't
see
nothing
in
the
way
of
it

*NL*
everybody
quit
thinking
the
nigger
done
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
not
everybody
.
A
good
many
thinks
he
done
it
.
But
they
'll
get
*NL*
the
nigger
pretty
soon
now
,
and
maybe
they
can
scare
it
out
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
are
they
after
him
yet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
're
innocent
,
ai
n't
you
!
Does
three
hundred
dollars
lay
*NL*
around
every
day
for
people
to
pick
up
?
Some
folks
think
the
nigger
*NL*
ai
n't
far
from
here
.
I
'm
one
of
them
--
but
I
hai
n't
talked
it
around
.
A
*NL*
few
days
ago
I
was
talking
with
an
old
couple
that
lives
next
door
in
*NL*
the
log
shanty
,
and
they
happened
to
say
hardly
anybody
ever
goes
to
*NL*
that
island
over
yonder
that
they
call
Jackson
's
Island
.
Do
n't
anybody
*NL*
live
there
?
says
I.
No
,
nobody
,
says
they
.
I
did
n't
say
any
more
,
but
*NL*
I
done
some
thinking
.
I
was
pretty
near
certain
I
'd
seen
smoke
over
*NL*
there
,
about
the
head
of
the
island
,
a
day
or
two
before
that
,
so
I
*NL*
says
to
myself
,
like
as
not
that
nigger
's
hiding
over
there
;
anyway
,
*NL*
says
I
,
it
's
worth
the
trouble
to
give
the
place
a
hunt
.
I
hai
n't
seen
*NL*
any
smoke
sence
,
so
I
reckon
maybe
he
's
gone
,
if
it
was
him
;
but
*NL*
husband
's
going
over
to
see
--
him
and
another
man
.
He
was
gone
up
the
*NL*
river
;
but
he
got
back
to-day
,
and
I
told
him
as
soon
as
he
got
here
*NL*
two
hours
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
got
so
uneasy
I
could
n't
set
still
.
I
had
to
do
something
with
*NL*
my
hands
;
so
I
took
up
a
needle
off
of
the
table
and
went
to
threading
*NL*
it
.
My
hands
shook
,
and
I
was
making
a
bad
job
of
it
.
When
the
woman
*NL*
stopped
talking
I
looked
up
,
and
she
was
looking
at
me
pretty
curious
*NL*
and
smiling
a
little
.
I
put
down
the
needle
and
thread
,
and
let
on
to
*NL*
be
interested
--
and
I
was
,
too
--
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Three
hundred
dollars
is
a
power
of
money
.
I
wish
my
mother
could
get
*NL*
it
.
Is
your
husband
going
over
there
to-night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
.
He
went
up-town
with
the
man
I
was
telling
you
of
,
to
get
a
*NL*
boat
and
see
if
they
could
borrow
another
gun
.
They
'll
go
over
after
*NL*
midnight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Could
n't
they
see
better
if
they
was
to
wait
till
daytime
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
And
could
n't
the
nigger
see
better
,
too
?
After
midnight
he
'll
*NL*
likely
be
asleep
,
and
they
can
slip
around
through
the
woods
and
hunt
*NL*
up
his
campfire
all
the
better
for
the
dark
,
if
he
's
got
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
think
of
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
kept
looking
at
me
pretty
curious
,
and
I
did
n't
feel
a
bit
*NL*
comfortable
.
Pretty
soon
she
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
you
say
your
name
was
,
honey
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
M
--
Mary
Williams
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Somehow
it
did
n't
seem
to
me
that
I
said
it
was
Mary
before
,
so
I
*NL*
did
n't
look
up
--
seemed
to
me
I
said
it
was
Sarah
;
so
I
felt
sort
of
*NL*
cornered
,
and
was
afeard
maybe
I
was
looking
it
,
too
.
I
wished
the
*NL*
woman
would
say
something
more
;
the
longer
she
set
still
the
uneasier
*NL*
I
was
.
But
now
she
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Honey
,
I
thought
you
said
it
was
Sarah
when
you
first
come
in
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
'm
,
I
did
.
Sarah
Mary
Williams
.
Sarah
's
my
first
name
.
Some
*NL*
calls
me
Sarah
,
some
calls
me
Mary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
's
the
way
of
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
'm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
feeling
better
then
,
but
I
wished
I
was
out
of
there
,
anyway
.
I
*NL*
could
n't
look
up
yet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
the
woman
fell
to
talking
about
how
hard
times
was
,
and
how
poor
*NL*
they
had
to
live
,
and
how
the
rats
was
as
free
as
if
they
owned
the
*NL*
place
,
and
so
forth
and
so
on
,
and
then
I
got
easy
again
.
She
was
*NL*
right
about
the
rats
.
You
'd
see
one
stick
his
nose
out
of
a
hole
in
*NL*
the
corner
every
little
while
.
She
said
she
had
to
have
things
handy
*NL*
to
throw
at
them
when
she
was
alone
,
or
they
would
n't
give
her
no
*NL*
peace
.
She
showed
me
a
bar
of
lead
twisted
up
into
a
knot
,
and
said
*NL*
she
was
a
good
shot
with
it
generly
,
but
she
'd
wrenched
her
arm
a
day
*NL*
or
two
ago
,
and
did
n't
know
whether
she
could
throw
true
now
.
But
she
*NL*
watched
for
a
chance
,
and
directly
banged
away
at
a
rat
;
but
she
*NL*
missed
him
wide
,
and
said
,
``
Ouch
!
''
it
hurt
her
arm
so
.
Then
she
told
*NL*
me
to
try
for
the
next
one
.
I
wanted
to
be
getting
away
before
the
old
*NL*
man
got
back
,
but
of
course
I
did
n't
let
on
.
I
got
the
thing
,
and
the
*NL*
first
rat
that
showed
his
nose
I
let
drive
,
and
if
he
'd
`
a
'
stayed
*NL*
where
he
was
he
'd
`
a
'
been
a
tolerable
sick
rat
.
She
said
that
was
*NL*
first-rate
,
and
she
reckoned
I
would
hive
the
next
one
.
She
went
and
*NL*
got
the
lump
of
lead
and
fetched
it
back
,
and
brought
along
a
hank
of
*NL*
yarn
which
she
wanted
me
to
help
her
with
.
I
held
up
my
two
hands
and
*NL*
she
put
the
hank
over
them
,
and
went
on
talking
about
her
and
her
*NL*
husband
's
matters
.
But
she
broke
off
to
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Keep
your
eye
on
the
rats
.
You
better
have
the
lead
in
your
lap
,
*NL*
handy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
she
dropped
the
lump
into
my
lap
just
at
that
moment
,
and
I
clapped
*NL*
my
legs
together
on
it
and
she
went
on
talking
.
But
only
about
a
*NL*
minute
.
Then
she
took
off
the
hank
and
looked
me
straight
in
the
face
,
*NL*
and
very
pleasant
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
now
,
what
's
your
real
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wh-hat
,
mum
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
your
real
name
?
Is
it
Bill
,
or
Tom
,
or
Bob
?
--
or
what
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
reckon
I
shook
like
a
leaf
,
and
I
did
n't
know
hardly
what
to
do
.
But
*NL*
I
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
to
do
n't
poke
fun
at
a
poor
girl
like
me
,
mum
.
If
I
'm
in
the
*NL*
way
here
,
I
'll
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
you
wo
n't
.
Set
down
and
stay
where
you
are
.
I
ai
n't
going
to
hurt
*NL*
you
,
and
I
ai
n't
going
to
tell
on
you
,
nuther
.
You
just
tell
me
your
*NL*
secret
,
and
trust
me
.
I
'll
keep
it
;
and
,
what
's
more
,
I
'll
help
you
.
*NL*
So
'll
my
old
man
if
you
want
him
to
.
You
see
,
you
're
a
runaway
*NL*
`
prentice
,
that
's
all
.
It
ai
n't
anything
.
There
ai
n't
no
harm
in
it
.
*NL*
You
've
been
treated
bad
,
and
you
made
up
your
mind
to
cut
.
Bless
you
,
*NL*
child
,
I
would
n't
tell
on
you
.
Tell
me
all
about
it
now
,
that
's
a
good
*NL*
boy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
I
said
it
would
n't
be
no
use
to
try
to
play
it
any
longer
,
and
I
*NL*
would
just
make
a
clean
breast
and
tell
her
everything
,
but
she
*NL*
must
n't
go
back
on
her
promise
.
Then
I
told
her
my
father
and
mother
*NL*
was
dead
,
and
the
law
had
bound
me
out
to
a
mean
old
farmer
in
the
*NL*
country
thirty
mile
back
from
the
river
,
and
he
treated
me
so
bad
I
*NL*
could
n't
stand
it
no
longer
;
he
went
away
to
be
gone
a
couple
of
days
,
*NL*
and
so
I
took
my
chance
and
stole
some
of
his
daughter
's
old
clothes
*NL*
and
cleared
out
,
and
I
had
been
three
nights
coming
the
thirty
miles
.
*NL*
I
traveled
nights
,
and
hid
daytimes
and
slept
,
and
the
bag
of
bread
*NL*
and
meat
I
carried
from
home
lasted
me
all
the
way
,
and
I
had
*NL*
a-plenty
.
I
said
I
believed
my
uncle
Abner
Moore
would
take
care
of
*NL*
me
,
and
so
that
was
why
I
struck
out
for
this
town
of
Goshen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Goshen
,
child
?
This
ai
n't
Goshen
.
This
is
St.
Petersburg
.
Goshen
's
*NL*
ten
mile
further
up
the
river
.
Who
told
you
this
was
Goshen
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
a
man
I
met
at
daybreak
this
morning
,
just
as
I
was
going
to
*NL*
turn
into
the
woods
for
my
regular
sleep
.
He
told
me
when
the
roads
*NL*
forked
I
must
take
the
right
hand
,
and
five
mile
would
fetch
me
to
*NL*
Goshen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
drunk
,
I
reckon
.
He
told
you
just
exactly
wrong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
he
did
act
like
he
was
drunk
,
but
it
ai
n't
no

I
got
*NL*
to
be
moving
along

I
'll
fetch
Goshen
before
daylight

*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
on

I
'll
put
you
up
a
snack
to
eat

You
might
want
it

*NL*
*NL*
So
she
put
me
up
a
snack
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say

when
a
cow
's
laying
down

*NL*
*NL*
``
George

*NL*
``

it

Do
n't
forget
and
tell

before
you
go

and
then
get
out
by
saying
it

George
*NL*
Elexander
when
I
catch
you

And
do
n't
go
about
women
in
that
old
*NL*
calico

You
do
a
girl
tolerable
poor
,
but
you
might
fool
men
,
maybe
.
*NL*
Bless
you
,
child
,
when
you
set
out
to
thread
a
needle
do
n't
hold
the
*NL*
thread
still
and
fetch
the
needle
up
to
it
;
hold
the
needle
still
and
*NL*
poke
the
thread
at
it
;
that
's
the
way
a
woman
most
always
does
,
but
a
*NL*
man
always
does
t
`
other
way
.
And
when
you
throw
at
a
rat
or
anything
,
*NL*
hitch
yourself
up
a-tiptoe
and
fetch
your
hand
up
over
your
head
as
*NL*
awkward
as
you
can
,
and
miss
your
rat
about
six
or
seven
foot
.
Throw
*NL*
stiff-armed
from
the
shoulder
,
like
there
was
a
pivot
there
for
it
to
*NL*
turn
on
,
like
a
girl
;
not
from
the
wrist
and
elbow
,
with
your
arm
out
*NL*
to
one
side
,
like
a
boy
.
And
,
mind
you
,
when
a
girl
tries
to
catch
*NL*
anything
in
her
lap
she
throws
her
knees
apart
;
she
do
n't
clap
them
*NL*
together
,
the
way
you
did
when
you
catched
the
lump
of
lead
.
Why
,
I
*NL*
spotted
you
for
a
boy
when
you
was
threading
the
needle
;
and
I
*NL*
contrived
the
other
things
just
to
make
certain
.
Now
trot
along
to
*NL*
your
uncle
,
Sarah
Mary
Williams
George
Elexander
Peters
,
and
if
you
*NL*
get
into
trouble
you
send
word
to
Mrs.
Judith
Loftus
,
which
is
me
,
and
*NL*
I
'll
do
what
I
can
to
get
you
out
of
it
.
Keep
the
river
road
all
the
*NL*
way
,
and
next
time
you
tramp
take
shoes
and
socks
with
you
.
The
river
*NL*
road
's
a
rocky
one
,
and
your
feet
'll
be
in
a
condition
when
you
get
*NL*
to
Goshen
,
I
reckon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
up
the
bank
about
fifty
yards
,
and
then
I
doubled
on
my
tracks
*NL*
and
slipped
back
to
where
my
canoe
was
,
a
good
piece
below
the
house
.
*NL*
I
jumped
in
,
and
was
off
in
a
hurry
.
I
went
up-stream
far
enough
to
*NL*
make
the
head
of
the
island
,
and
then
started
across
.
I
took
off
the
*NL*
sun-bonnet
,
for
I
did
n't
want
no
blinders
on
then
.
When
I
was
about
*NL*
the
middle
I
heard
the
clock
begin
to
strike
,
so
I
stops
and
listens
;
*NL*
the
sound
come
faint
over
the
water
but
clear
--
eleven
.
When
I
struck
*NL*
the
head
of
the
island
I
never
waited
to
blow
,
though
I
was
most
*NL*
winded
,
but
I
shoved
right
into
the
timber
where
my
old
camp
used
to
*NL*
be
,
and
started
a
good
fire
there
on
a
high
and
dry
spot
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
I
jumped
in
the
canoe
and
dug
out
for
our
place
,
a
mile
and
a
*NL*
half
below
,
as
hard
as
I
could
go
.
I
landed
,
and
slopped
through
the
*NL*
timber
and
up
the
ridge
and
into
the
cavern
.
There
Jim
laid
,
sound
*NL*
asleep
on
the
ground
.
I
roused
him
out
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Git
up
and
hump
yourself
,
Jim
!
There
ai
n't
a
minute
to
lose
.
They
're
*NL*
after
us
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jim
never
asked
no
questions
,
he
never
said
a
word
;
but
the
way
he
*NL*
worked
for
the
next
half
an
hour
showed
about
how
he
was
scared
.
By
*NL*
that
time
everything
we
had
in
the
world
was
on
our
raft
,
and
she
was
*NL*
ready
to
be
shoved
out
from
the
willow
cove
where
she
was
hid
.
We
put
*NL*
out
the
camp-fire
at
the
cavern
the
first
thing
,
and
did
n't
show
a
*NL*
candle
outside
after
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
the
canoe
out
from
the
shore
a
little
piece
,
and
took
a
look
;
*NL*
but
if
there
was
a
boat
around
I
could
n't
see
it
,
for
stars
and
*NL*
shadows
ai
n't
good
to
see
by
.
Then
we
got
out
the
raft
and
slipped
*NL*
along
down
in
the
shade
,
past
the
foot
of
the
island
dead
still
--
never
*NL*
saying
a
word
.
*NL*

CHAPTER
XII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
must
`
a
'
been
close
on
to
one
o'clock
when
we
got
below
the
island
*NL*
at
last
,
and
the
raft
did
seem
to
go
mighty
slow
.
If
a
boat
was
to
*NL*
come
along
we
was
going
to
take
to
the
canoe
and
break
for
the
*NL*
Illinois
shore
;
and
it
was
well
a
boat
did
n't
come
,
for
we
had
n't
ever
*NL*
thought
to
put
the
gun
in
the
canoe
,
or
a
fishing-line
,
or
anything
to
*NL*
eat
.
We
was
in
ruther
too
much
of
a
sweat
to
think
of
so
many
things
.
*NL*
It
war
n't
good
judgment
to
put
_
everything
_
on
the
raft
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
men
went
to
the
island
I
just
expect
they
found
the
camp-fire
I
*NL*
built
,
and
watched
it
all
night
for
Jim
to
come
.
Anyways
,
they
stayed
*NL*
away
from
us
,
and
if
my
building
the
fire
never
fooled
them
it
war
n't
*NL*
no
fault
of
mine
.
I
played
it
as
low
down
on
them
as
I
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
first
streak
of
day
began
to
show
we
tied
up
to
a
towhead
in
*NL*
a
big
bend
on
the
Illinois
side
,
and
hacked
off
cottonwood
branches
*NL*
with
the
hatchet
,
and
covered
up
the
raft
with
them
so
she
looked
like
*NL*
there
had
been
a
cave-in
in
the
bank
there
.
A
towhead
is
a
sand-bar
*NL*
that
has
cottonwoods
on
it
as
thick
as
harrow-teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
mountains
on
the
Missouri
shore
and
heavy
timber
on
the
*NL*
Illinois
side
,
and
the
channel
was
down
the
Missouri
shore
at
that
*NL*
place
,
so
we
war
n't
afraid
of
anybody
running
across
us
.
We
laid
there
*NL*
all
day
,
and
watched
the
rafts
and
steamboats
spin
down
the
Missouri
*NL*
shore
,
and
up-bound
steamboats
fight
the
big
river
in
the
middle
.
I
*NL*
told
Jim
all
about
the
time
I
had
jabbering
with
that
woman
;
and
Jim
*NL*
said
she
was
a
smart
one
,
and
if
she
was
to
start
after
us
herself
she
*NL*
would
n't
set
down
and
watch
a
camp-fire
--
no
,
sir
,
she
'd
fetch
a
dog
.
*NL*
Well
,
then
,
I
said
,
why
could
n't
she
tell
her
husband
to
fetch
a
dog
?
*NL*
Jim
said
he
bet
she
did
think
of
it
by
the
time
the
men
was
ready
to
*NL*
start
,
and
he
believed
they
must
`
a
'
gone
up-town
to
get
a
dog
and
so
*NL*
they
lost
all
that
time
,
or
else
we
would
n't
be
here
on
a
towhead
*NL*
sixteen
or
seventeen
mile
below
the
village
--
no
,
indeedy
,
we
would
be
*NL*
in
that
same
old
town
again
.
So
I
said
I
did
n't
care
what
was
the
*NL*
reason
they
did
n't
get
us
as
long
as
they
did
n't
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
it
was
beginning
to
come
on
dark
we
poked
our
heads
out
of
the
*NL*
cottonwood
thicket
,
and
looked
up
and
down
and
across
;
nothing
in
*NL*
sight
;
so
Jim
took
up
some
of
the
top
planks
of
the
raft
and
built
a
*NL*
snug
wigwam
to
get
under
in
blazing
weather
and
rainy
,
and
to
keep
the
*NL*
things
dry
.
Jim
made
a
floor
for
the
wigwam
,
and
raised
it
a
foot
or
*NL*
more
above
the
level
of
the
raft
,
so
now
the
blankets
and
all
the
*NL*
traps
was
out
of
reach
of
steamboat
waves
.
Right
in
the
middle
of
the
*NL*
wigwam
we
made
a
layer
of
dirt
about
five
or
six
inches
deep
with
a
*NL*
frame
around
it
for
to
hold
it
to
its
place
;
this
was
to
build
a
fire
*NL*
on
in
sloppy
weather
or
chilly
;
the
wigwam
would
keep
it
from
being
*NL*
seen
.
We
made
an
extra
steering-oar
,
too
,
because
one
of
the
others
*NL*
might
get
broke
on
a
snag
or
something
.
We
fixed
up
a
short
forked
*NL*
stick
to
hang
the
old
lantern
on
,
because
we
must
always
light
the
*NL*
lantern
whenever
we
see
a
steamboat
coming
down-stream
,
to
keep
from
*NL*
getting
run
over
;
but
we
would
n't
have
to
light
it
for
up-stream
boats
*NL*
unless
we
see
we
was
in
what
they
call
a
``
crossing
''
;
for
the
river
was
*NL*
pretty
high
yet
,
very
low
banks
being
still
a
little
under
water
;
so
*NL*
up-bound
boats
did
n't
always
run
the
channel
,
but
hunted
easy
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
second
night
we
run
between
seven
and
eight
hours
,
with
a
current
*NL*
that
was
making
over
four
mile
an
hour
.
We
catched
fish
and
talked
,
*NL*
and
we
took
a
swim
now
and
then
to
keep
off
sleepiness
.
It
was
kind
of
*NL*
solemn
,
drifting
down
the
big
,
still
river
,
laying
on
our
backs
*NL*
looking
up
at
the
stars
,
and
we
did
n't
ever
feel
like
talking
loud
,
*NL*
and
it
war
n't
often
that
we
laughed
--
only
a
little
kind
of
a
low
*NL*
chuckle
.
We
had
mighty
good
weather
as
a
general
thing
,
and
nothing
*NL*
ever
happened
to
us
at
all
--
that
night
,
nor
the
next
,
nor
the
next
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
night
we
passed
towns
,
some
of
them
away
up
on
black
hillsides
,
*NL*
nothing
but
just
a
shiny
bed
of
lights
;
not
a
house
could
you
see
.
The
*NL*
fifth
night
we
passed
St.
Louis
,
and
it
was
like
the
whole
world
lit
*NL*
up
.
In
St.
Petersburg
they
used
to
say
there
was
twenty
or
thirty
*NL*
thousand
people
in
St.
Louis
,
but
I
never
believed
it
till
I
see
that
*NL*
wonderful
spread
of
lights
at
two
o'clock
that
still
night
.
There
*NL*
war
n't
a
sound
there
;
everybody
was
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
night
now
I
used
to
slip
ashore
toward
ten
o'clock
at
some
*NL*
little
village
,
and
buy
ten
or
fifteen
cents
'
worth
of
meal
or
bacon
*NL*
or
other
stuff
to
eat
;
and
sometimes
I
lifted
a
chicken
that
war
n't
*NL*
roosting
comfortable
,
and
took
him
along
.
Pap
always
said
,
take
a
*NL*
chicken
when
you
get
a
chance
,
because
if
you
do
n't
want
him
yourself
*NL*
you
can
easy
find
somebody
that
does
,
and
a
good
deed
ai
n't
ever
*NL*
forgot
.
I
never
see
pap
when
he
did
n't
want
the
chicken
himself
,
but
*NL*
that
is
what
he
used
to
say
,
anyway
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mornings
before
daylight
I
slipped
into
corn-fields
and
borrowed
a
*NL*
watermelon
,
or
a
mushmelon
,
or
a
punkin
,
or
some
new
corn
,
or
things
*NL*
of
that
kind
.
Pap
always
said
it
war
n't
no
harm
to
borrow
things
if
*NL*
you
was
meaning
to
pay
them
back
some
time
;
but
the
widow
said
it
*NL*
war
n't
anything
but
a
soft
name
for
stealing
,
and
no
decent
body
would
*NL*
do
it
.
Jim
said
he
reckoned
the
widow
was
partly
right
and
pap
was
*NL*
partly
right
;
so
the
best
way
would
be
for
us
to
pick
out
two
or
three
*NL*
things
from
the
list
and
say
we
would
n't
borrow
them
any
more
--
then
he
*NL*
reckoned
it
would
n't
be
no
harm
to
borrow
the
others
.
So
we
talked
it
*NL*
over
all
one
night
,
drifting
along
down
the
river
,
trying
to
make
up
*NL*
our
minds
whether
to
drop
the
watermelons
,
or
the
cantelopes
,
or
the
*NL*
mushmelons
,
or
what
.
But
toward
daylight
we
got
it
all
settled
*NL*
satisfactory
,
and
concluded
to
drop
crabapples
and
p
`
simmons
.
We
*NL*
war
n't
feeling
just
right
before
that
,
but
it
was
all
comfortable
now
.
*NL*
I
was
glad
the
way
it
come
out
,
too
,
because
crabapples
ai
n't
ever
*NL*
good
,
and
the
p
`
simmons
would
n't
be
ripe
for
two
or
three
months
yet
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
shot
a
water-fowl
now
and
then
that
got
up
too
early
in
the
morning
*NL*
or
did
n't
go
to
bed
early
enough
in
the
evening
.
Take
it
all
round
,
we
*NL*
lived
pretty
high
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fifth
night
below
St.
Louis
we
had
a
big
storm
after
midnight
,
*NL*
with
a
power
of
thunder
and
lightning
,
and
the
rain
poured
down
in
a
*NL*
solid
sheet
.
We
stayed
in
the
wigwam
and
let
the
raft
take
care
of
*NL*
itself
.
When
the
lightning
glared
out
we
could
see
a
big
straight
*NL*
river
ahead
,
and
high
,
rocky
bluffs
on
both
sides
.
By
and
by
says
I
,
*NL*
``
Hel
-
_
lo
_
,
Jim
,
looky
yonder
!
''
It
was
a
steamboat
that
had
killed
*NL*
herself
on
a
rock
.
We
was
drifting
straight
down
for
her
.
The
*NL*
lightning
showed
her
very
distinct
.
She
was
leaning
over
,
with
part
of
*NL*
her
upper
deck
above
water
,
and
you
could
see
every
little
chimbly-guy
*NL*
clean
and
clear
,
and
a
chair
by
the
big
bell
,
with
an
old
slouch
hat
*NL*
hanging
on
the
back
of
it
,
when
the
flashes
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
it
being
away
in
the
night
and
stormy
,
and
all
so
*NL*
mysterious-like
,
I
felt
just
the
way
any
other
boy
would
`
a
'
felt
when
*NL*
I
seen
that
wreck
laying
there
so
mournful
and
lonesome
in
the
middle
*NL*
of
the
river
.
I
wanted
to
get
aboard
of
her
and
slink
around
a
little
,
*NL*
and
see
what
there
was
there
.
So
I
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Le
's
land
on
her
,
Jim
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Jim
was
dead
against
it
at
first
.
He
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
doan
'
want
to
go
fool
'n'
`
long
er
no
wrack
.
We
's
doin
'
blame
'
well
,
*NL*
en
we
better
let
blame
'
well
alone
,
as
de
good
book
says
.
Like
as
not
*NL*
dey
's
a
watchman
on
dat
wrack
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Watchman
your
grandmother
,
''
I
says
;
``
there
ai
n't
nothing
to
watch
but
*NL*
the
texas
and
the
pilot-house
;
and
do
you
reckon
anybody
's
going
to
*NL*
resk
his
life
for
a
texas
and
a
pilot-house
such
a
night
as
this
,
when
*NL*
it
's
likely
to
break
up
and
wash
off
down
the
river
any
minute
?
''
Jim
*NL*
could
n't
say
nothing
to
that
,
so
he
did
n't
try
.
``
And
besides
,
''
I
says
,
*NL*
``
we
might
borrow
something
worth
having
out
of
the
captain
's
*NL*
stateroom
.
Seegars
,
I
bet
you
--
and
cost
five
cents
apiece
,
solid
cash
.
*NL*
Steamboat
captains
is
always
rich
,
and
get
sixty
dollars
a
month
,
and
*NL*
_
they
_
do
n't
care
a
cent
what
a
thing
costs
,
you
know
,
long
as
they
*NL*
want
it
.
Stick
a
candle
in
your
pocket
;
I
ca
n't
rest
,
Jim
,
till
we
*NL*
give
her
a
rummaging
.
Do
you
reckon
Tom
Sawyer
would
ever
go
by
this
*NL*
thing
?
Not
for
pie
,
he
would
n't
.
He
'd
call
it
an
adventure
--
that
's
*NL*
what
he
'd
call
it
;
and
he
'd
land
on
that
wreck
if
it
was
his
last
act
.
*NL*
And
would
n't
he
throw
style
into
it
?
--
would
n't
he
spread
himself
,
nor
*NL*
nothing
?
Why
,
you
'd
think
it
was
Christopher
C'lumbus
discovering
*NL*
Kingdom
Come
.
I
wish
Tom
Sawyer
_
was
_
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jim
he
grumbled
a
little
,
but
give
in
.
He
said
we
must
n't
talk
any
*NL*
more
than
we
could
help
,
and
then
talk
mighty
low
.
The
lightning
*NL*
showed
us
the
wreck
again
just
in
time
,
and
we
fetched
the
stabboard
*NL*
derrick
,
and
made
fast
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
deck
was
high
out
here
.
We
went
sneaking
down
the
slope
of
it
to
*NL*
labboard
,
in
the
dark
,
towards
the
texas
,
feeling
our
way
slow
with
*NL*
our
feet
,
and
spreading
our
hands
out
to
fend
off
the
guys
,
for
it
was
*NL*
so
dark
we
could
n't
see
no
sign
of
them
.
Pretty
soon
we
struck
the
*NL*
forward
end
of
the
skylight
,
and
clumb
on
to
it
;
and
the
next
step
*NL*
fetched
us
in
front
of
the
captain
's
door
,
which
was
open
,
and
by
*NL*
Jimminy
,
away
down
through
the
texas-hall
we
see
a
light
!
and
all
in
*NL*
the
same
second
we
seem
to
hear
low
voices
in
yonder
!
*NL*
*NL*
Jim
whispered
and
said
he
was
feeling
powerful
sick
,
and
told
me
to
*NL*
come
along
.
I
says
,
all
right
,
and
was
going
to
start
for
the
raft
;
*NL*
but
just
then
I
heard
a
voice
wail
out
and
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
please
do
n't
,
boys
;
I
swear
I
wo
n't
ever
tell
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Another
voice
said
,
pretty
loud
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
lie
,
Jim
Turner
.
You
've
acted
this
way
before
.
You
always
want
*NL*
more
'n
your
share
of
the
truck
,
and
you
've
always
got
it
,
too
,
because
*NL*
you
've
swore
'
t
if
you
did
n't
you
'd
tell
.
But
this
time
you
've
said
it
*NL*
jest
one
time
too
many
.
You
're
the
meanest
,
treacherousest
hound
in
*NL*
this
country
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
Jim
was
gone
for
the
raft
.
I
was
just
a-biling
with
*NL*
curiosity
;
and
I
says
to
myself
,
Tom
Sawyer
would
n't
back
out
now
,
and
*NL*
so
I
wo
n't
either
;
I
'm
a-going
to
see
what
's
going
on
here
.
So
I
*NL*
dropped
on
my
hands
and
knees
in
the
little
passage
,
and
crept
aft
in
*NL*
the
dark
till
there
war
n't
but
one
stateroom
betwixt
me
and
the
*NL*
cross-hall
of
the
texas
.
Then
in
there
I
see
a
man
stretched
on
the
*NL*
floor
and
tied
hand
and
foot
,
and
two
men
standing
over
him
,
and
one
*NL*
of
them
had
a
dim
lantern
in
his
hand
,
and
the
other
one
had
a
pistol
.
*NL*
This
one
kept
pointing
the
pistol
at
the
man
's
head
on
the
floor
,
and
*NL*
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
_
like
_
to
!
And
I
orter
,
too
--
a
mean
skunk
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
on
the
floor
would
shrivel
up
and
say
,
``
Oh
,
please
do
n't
,
*NL*
Bill
;
I
hai
n't
ever
goin
'
to
tell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
every
time
he
said
that
the
man
with
the
lantern
would
laugh
and
*NL*
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Deed
you
_
ai
n't
!
_
You
never
said
no
truer
thing
'n
that
,
you
bet
*NL*
you
.
''
And
once
he
said
:
``
Hear
him
beg
!
and
yit
if
we
had
n't
got
the
*NL*
best
of
him
and
tied
him
he
'd
`
a
'
killed
us
both
.
And
what
_
for
_
?
Jist
*NL*
for
noth
'n'
.
Jist
because
we
stood
on
our
_
rights
_
--
that
's
what
for
.
*NL*
But
I
lay
you
ai
n't
a-goin
'
to
threaten
nobody
any
more
,
Jim
Turner
.
*NL*
Put
_
up
_
that
pistol
,
Bill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bill
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
to
,
Jake
Packard
.
I
'm
for
killin
'
him
--
and
did
n't
he
*NL*
kill
old
Hatfield
jist
the
same
way
--
and
do
n't
he
deserve
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
do
n't
_
want
_
him
killed
,
and
I
've
got
my
reasons
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bless
yo
'
heart
for
them
words
,
Jake
Packard
!
I
'll
never
forgit
you
*NL*
long
's
I
live
!
''
says
the
man
on
the
floor
,
sort
of
blubbering
.
*NL*
*NL*
Packard
did
n't
take
no
notice
of
that
,
but
hung
up
his
lantern
on
a
*NL*
nail
and
started
toward
where
I
was
,
there
in
the
dark
,
and
motioned
*NL*
Bill
to
come
.
I
crawfished
as
fast
as
I
could
about
two
yards
,
but
the
*NL*
boat
slanted
so
that
I
could
n't
make
very
good
time
;
so
to
keep
from
*NL*
getting
run
over
and
catched
I
crawled
into
a
stateroom
on
the
upper
*NL*
side
.
The
man
came
a-pawing
along
in
the
dark
,
and
when
Packard
got
to
*NL*
my
stateroom
,
he
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
--
come
in
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
in
he
come
,
and
Bill
after
him
.
But
before
they
got
in
I
was
up
in
*NL*
the
upper
berth
,
cornered
,
and
sorry
I
come
.
Then
they
stood
there
,
*NL*
with
their
hands
on
the
ledge
of
the
berth
,
and
talked
.
I
could
n't
see
*NL*
them
,
but
I
could
tell
where
they
was
by
the
whisky
they
'd
been
*NL*
having
.
I
was
glad
I
did
n't
drink
whisky
;
but
it
would
n't
made
much
*NL*
difference
anyway
,
because
most
of
the
time
they
could
n't
`
a
'
treed
me
*NL*
because
I
did
n't
breathe
.
I
was
too
scared
.
And
,
besides
,
a
body
*NL*
_
could
n't
_
breathe
and
hear
such
talk
.
They
talked
low
and
earnest
.
*NL*
Bill
wanted
to
kill
Turner
.
He
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
said
he
'll
tell
,
and
he
will
.
If
we
was
to
give
both
our
shares
*NL*
to
him
_
now
_
it
would
n't
make
no
difference
after
the
row
and
the
way
*NL*
we
've
served
him
.
Shore
's
you
're
born
,
he
'll
turn
state
's
evidence
;
*NL*
now
you
hear
_
me
.
_
I
'm
for
putting
him
out
of
his
troubles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
'm
I
,
''
says
Packard
,
very
quiet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Blame
it
,
I
'd
sorter
begun
to
think
you
was
n't
.
Well
,
then
,
that
's
*NL*
all
right
.
Le
's
go
and
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
on
a
minute
;
I
hai
n't
had
my
say
yit
.
You
listen
to
me
.
*NL*
Shooting
's
good
,
but
there
's
quieter
ways
if
the
things
_
got
_
to
be
*NL*
done
.
But
what
_
I
_
say
is
this
:
it
ai
n't
good
sense
to
go
court
'n'
*NL*
around
after
a
halter
if
you
can
git
at
what
you
're
up
to
in
some
way
*NL*
that
's
jist
as
good
and
at
the
same
time
do
n't
bring
you
into
no
*NL*
resks
.
Ai
n't
that
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
bet
it
is
.
But
how
you
goin
'
to
manage
it
this
time
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
idea
is
this
:
we
'll
rustle
around
and
gather
up
whatever
*NL*
pickin
's
we
've
overlooked
in
the
staterooms
,
and
shove
for
shore
and
*NL*
hide
the
truck
.
Then
we
'll
wait
.
Now
I
say
it
ai
n't
a-goin
'
to
be
*NL*
more
'n
two
hours
befo
'
this
wrack
breaks
up
and
washes
off
down
the
*NL*
river
.
See
?
He
'll
be
drownded
,
and
wo
n't
have
nobody
to
blame
for
it
*NL*
but
his
own
self
.
I
reckon
that
's
a
considerable
sight
better
'n
*NL*
killin
'
of
him
.
I
'm
unfavorable
to
killin
'
a
man
as
long
as
you
can
*NL*
git
aroun
'
it
;
it
ai
n't
good
sense
,
it
ai
n't
good
morals
.
Ai
n't
I
*NL*
right
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
reck
'n
you
are
.
But
s
`
pose
she
_
do
n't
_
break
up
and
wash
off
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
we
can
wait
the
two
hours
anyway
and
see
,
ca
n't
we
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
then
;
come
along
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
they
started
,
and
I
lit
out
,
all
in
a
cold
sweat
,
and
scrambled
*NL*
forward
.
It
was
dark
as
pitch
there
;
but
I
said
,
in
a
kind
of
a
coarse
*NL*
whisper
,
``
Jim
!
''
and
he
answered
up
,
right
at
my
elbow
,
with
a
sort
of
*NL*
a
moan
,
and
I
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quick
,
Jim
,
it
ai
n't
no
time
for
fooling
around
and
moaning
;
there
's
*NL*
a

of
murderers
in
yonder
,
and
if
we
do
n't
hunt
up
their
boat
and
*NL*
set
her
drifting
down
the
river
so
these
fellows
ca

get
away
from
*NL*
the
wreck
there
's
one
of
'em
going
to
be
in
a
bad

But
if

CHAPTER
XIII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
I
catched
my
breath
and
most
fainted
.
Shut
up
on
a
wreck
with
*NL*
such
a
gang
as
that
!
But
it
war
n't
no
time
to
be
sentimentering
.
We
'd
*NL*
_
got
_
to
find
that
boat
now
--
had
to
have
it
for
ourselves
.
So
we
went
*NL*
a-quaking
and
shaking
down
the
stabboard
side
,
and
slow
work
it
was
,
*NL*
too
--
seemed
a
week
before
we
got
to
the
stern
.
No
sign
of
a
boat
.
Jim
*NL*
said
he
did
n't
believe
he
could
go
any
farther
--
so
scared
he
had
n't
*NL*
hardly
any
strength
left
,
he
said
.
But
I
said
,
come
on
,
if
we
get
left
*NL*
on
this
wreck
we
are
in
a
fix
,
sure
.
So
on
we
prowled
again
.
We
struck
*NL*
for
the
stern
of
the
texas
,
and
found
it
,
and
then
scrabbled
along
*NL*
forwards
on
the
skylight
,
hanging
on
from
shutter
to
shutter
,
for
the
*NL*
edge
of
the
skylight
was
in
the
water
.
When
we
got
pretty
close
to
the
*NL*
cross-hall
door
there
was
the
skiff
,
sure
enough
!
I
could
just
barely
*NL*
see
her
.
I
felt
ever
so
thankful
.
In
another
second
I
would
`
a
'
been
*NL*
aboard
of
her
,
but
just
then
the
door
opened
.
One
of
the
men
stuck
his
*NL*
head
out
only
about
a
couple
of
foot
from
me
,
and
I
thought
I
was
*NL*
gone
;
but
he
jerked
it
in
again
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heave
that
blame
lantern
out
o
'
sight
,
Bill
!
''
He
flung
a
bag
of
*NL*
something
into
the
boat
,
and
then
got
in
himself
and
set
down
.
It
was
*NL*
Packard
.
Then
Bill
_
he
_
come
out
and
got
in
.
Packard
says
,
in
a
low
*NL*
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
ready
--
shove
off
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
n't
hardly
hang
on
to
the
shutters
,
I
was
so
weak
.
But
Bill
*NL*
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
on
--
'd
you
go
through
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
Did
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
So
he
's
got
his
share
o
'
the
cash
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
come
along
;
no
use
to
take
truck
and
leave
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
wo
n't
he
suspicion
what
we
're
up
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maybe
he
wo
n't
.
But
we
got
to
have
it
anyway
.
Come
along
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
they
got
out
and
went
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
slammed
to
because
it
was
on
the
careened
side
;
and
in
a
half
*NL*
second
I
was
in
the
boat
,
and
Jim
come
tumbling
after
me
.
I
out
with
*NL*
my
knife
and
cut
the
rope
,
and
away
we
went
!
*NL*
*NL*
We
did
n't
touch
an
oar
,
and
we
did
n't
speak
nor
whisper
,
nor
hardly
*NL*
even
breathe
.
We
went
gliding
swift
along
,
dead
silent
,
past
the
tip
*NL*
of
the
paddle-box
,
and
past
the
stern
;
then
in
a
second
or
two
more
we
*NL*
was
a
hundred
yards
below
the
wreck
,
and
the
darkness
soaked
her
up
,
*NL*
every
last
sign
of
her
,
and
we
was
safe
,
and
knowed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
was
three
or
four
hundred
yards
down-stream
we
see
the
lantern
*NL*
show
like
a
little
spark
at
the
texas
door
for
a
second
,
and
we
knowed
*NL*
by
that
that
the
rascals
had
missed
their
boat
,
and
was
beginning
to
*NL*
understand
that
they
was
in
just
as
much
trouble
now
as
Jim
Turner
*NL*
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Jim
manned
the
oars
,
and
we
took
out
after
our
raft
.
Now
was
the
*NL*
first
time
that
I
begun
to
worry
about
the
men
--
I
reckon
I
had
n't
had
*NL*
time
to
before
.
I
begun
to
think
how
dreadful
it
was
,
even
for
*NL*
murderers
,
to
be
in
such
a
fix
.
I
says
to
myself
,
there
ai
n't
no
*NL*
telling
but
I
might
come
to
be
a
murderer
myself
yet
,
and
then
how
*NL*
would
I
like
it
?
So
says
I
to
Jim
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
first
light
we
see
we
'll
land
a
hundred
yards
below
it
or
above
*NL*
it
,
in
a
place
where
it
's
a
good
hiding-place
for
you
and
the
skiff
,
*NL*
and
then
I
'll
go
and
fix
up
some
kind
of
a
yarn
,
and
get
somebody
to
*NL*
go
for
that
gang
and
get
them
out
of
their
scrape
,
so
they
can
be
hung
*NL*
when
their
time
comes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
that
idea
was
a
failure
;
for
pretty
soon
it
begun
to
storm
again
,
*NL*
and
this
time
worse
than
ever
.
The
rain
poured
down
,
and
never
a
light
*NL*
showed
;
everybody
in
bed
,
I
reckon
.
We
boomed
along
down
the
river
,
*NL*
watching
for
lights
and
watching
for
our
raft
.
After
a
long
time
the
*NL*
rain
let
up
,
but
the
clouds
stayed
,
and
the
lightning
kept
whimpering
,
*NL*
and
by
and
by
a
flash
showed
us
a
black
thing
ahead
,
floating
,
and
we
*NL*
made
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
raft
,
and
mighty
glad
was
we
to
get
aboard
of
it
again
.
We
*NL*
seen
a
light
now
away
down
to
the
right
,
on
shore
.
So
I
said
I
would
*NL*
go
for
it
.
The
skiff
was
half
full
of
plunder
which
that
gang
had
*NL*
stole
there
on
the
wreck
.
We
hustled
it
on
to
the
raft
in
a
pile
,
and
*NL*
I
told
Jim
to
float
along
down
,
and
show
a
light
when
he
judged
he
had
*NL*
gone
about
two
mile
,
and
keep
it
burning
till
I
come
;
then
I
manned
my
*NL*
oars
and
shoved
for
the
light
.
As
I
got
down
towards
it
three
or
four
*NL*
more
showed
--
up
on
a
hillside
.
It
was
a
village
.
I
closed
in
above
the
*NL*
shore
light
,
and
laid
on
my
oars
and
floated
.
As
I
went
by
I
see
it
*NL*
was
a
lantern
hanging
on
the
jackstaff
of
a
double-hull
ferryboat
.
I
*NL*
skimmed
around
for
the
watchman
,
a-wondering
whereabouts
he
slept
;
and
*NL*
by
and
by
I
found
him
roosting
on
the
bitts
forward
,
with
his
head
*NL*
down
between
his
knees
.
I
gave
his
shoulder
two
or
three
little
*NL*
shoves
,
and
begun
to
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stirred
up
in
a
kind
of
a
startlish
way
;
but
when
he
see
it
was
*NL*
only
me
he
took
a
good
gap
and
stretch
,
and
then
he
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hello
,
what
's
up
?
Do
n't
cry
,
bub
.
What
's
the
trouble
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pap
,
and
mam
,
and
sis
,
and
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
I
broke
down
.
He
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dang
it
now
,

do
n't

take
on
so

*NL*
*NL*
``

he
says

kind
of
pretty-well-satisfied
like
.

She

just
in

the
evening
she
started
over
with

in

horse-ferry

stay
all
night
at
her
friend

house

Miss

I

and
they
lost
their

swung

around

went
a-floating

stern

about
two

saddle-baggsed

Miss

she
made

got

aboard

Well

about
an

after
dark
we
come
along
down
in

it
was
so
dark

*NL*
*NL*

Well

we
hollered
and
took
on

it

so
wide

we
could

nobody

So
pap
said
somebody
got
to
get
ashore

get
help

somehow

I
was
the
only

I
made

turn
out

about

out
you

safe

Hump
yourself
,
now
;
I
'm
*NL*
a-going
up
around
the
corner
here
to
roust
out
my
engineer

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
struck
for
the
light
,
but
as
soon
as
he
turned
the
corner
I
went
*NL*
back
and
got
into
my
skiff
and
bailed
her
out
,
and
then
pulled
up
*NL*
shore
in
the
easy
water
about
six
hundred
yards
,
and
tucked
myself
in
*NL*
among
some
wood-boats
;
for
I
could
n't
rest
easy
till
I
could
see
the
*NL*
ferryboat
start
.
But
take
it
all
around
,
I
was
feeling
ruther
*NL*
comfortable
on
accounts
of
taking
all
this
trouble
for
that
gang
,
for
*NL*
not
many
would
`
a
'
done
it
.
I
wished
the
widow
knowed
about
it
.
I
*NL*
judged
she
would
be
proud
of
me
for
helping
these
rapscallions
,
*NL*
because
rapscallions
and
dead-beats
is
the
kind
the
widow
and
good
*NL*
people
takes
the
most
interest
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
before
long
here
comes
the
wreck
,
dim
and
dusky
,
sliding
along
*NL*
down
!
A
kind
of
cold
shiver
went
through
me
,
and
then
I
struck
out
for
*NL*
her
.
She
was
very
deep
,
and
I
see
in
a
minute
there
war
n't
much
chance
*NL*
for
anybody
being
alive
in
her
.
I
pulled
all
around
her
and
hollered
a
*NL*
little
,
but
there
was
n't
any
answer
;
all
dead
still
.
I
felt
a
little
*NL*
bit
heavy-hearted
about
the
gang
,
but
not
much
,
for
I
reckoned
if
they
*NL*
could
stand
it
I
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
here
comes
the
ferryboat
;
so
I
shoved
for
the
middle
of
the
river
*NL*
on
a
long
down-stream
slant
;
and
when
I
judged
I
was
out
of
eye-reach
*NL*
I
laid
on
my
oars
,
and
looked
back
and
see
her
go
and
smell
around
the
*NL*
wreck
for
Miss
Hooker
's
remainders
,
because
the
captain
would
know
her
*NL*
uncle
Hornback
would
want
them
;
and
then
pretty
soon
the
ferryboat
*NL*
give
it
up
and
went
for
the
shore
,
and
I
laid
into
my
work
and
went
*NL*
a-booming
down
the
river
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
did
seem
a
powerful
long
time
before
Jim
's
light
showed
up
;
and
*NL*
when
it
did
show
it
looked
like
it
was
a
thousand
mile
off
.
By
the
*NL*
time
I
got
there
the
sky
was
beginning
to
get
a
little
gray
in
the
*NL*
east
;
so
we
struck
for
an
island
,
and
hid
the
raft
,
and
sunk
the
*NL*
skiff
,
and
turned
in
and
slept
like
dead
people
.

CHAPTER
XIV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
By
and
by
,
when
we
got
up
,
we
turned
over
the
truck
the
gang
had
stole
*NL*
off
of
the
wreck
,
and
found
boots
,
and
blankets
,
and
clothes
,
and
all
*NL*
sorts
of
other
things
,
and
a
lot
of
books
,
and
a
spy-glass
,
and
three
*NL*
boxes
of
seegars
.
We
had
n't
ever
been
this
rich
before
in
neither
of
*NL*
our
lives
.
The
seegars
was
prime
.
We
laid
off
all
the
afternoon
in
the
*NL*
woods
talking
,
and
me
reading
the
books
,
and
having
a
general
good
*NL*
time
.
I
told
Jim
all
about
what
happened
inside
the
wreck
and
at
the
*NL*
ferryboat
,
and
I
said
these
kinds
of
things
was
adventures
;
but
he
*NL*
said
he
did
n't
want
no
more
adventures
.
He
said
that
when
I
went
in
*NL*
the
texas
and
he
crawled
back
to
get
on
the
raft
and
found
her
gone
he
*NL*
nearly
died
,
because
he
judged
it
was
all
up
with
_
him
_
anyway
it
*NL*
could
be
fixed
;
for
if
he
did
n't
get
saved
he
would
get
drownded
;
and
*NL*
if
he
did
get
saved
,
whoever
saved
him
would
send
him
back
home
so
as
*NL*
to
get
the
reward
,
and
then
Miss
Watson
would
sell
him
South
,
sure
.
*NL*
Well
,
he
was
right
;
he
was
most
always
right
;
he
had
an
uncommon
level
*NL*
head
for
a
nigger
.
I
read
considerable
to
Jim
about
kings
and
dukes
*NL*
and
earls
and
such
,
and
how
gaudy
they
dressed
,
and
how
much
style
*NL*
they
put
on
,
and
called
each
other
and
so
on
,
`
stead
of
mister
;
and
*NL*
Jim
's
eyes
bugged
out
,
and
he
was
interested
.
He
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``

;
``

*NL*
*NL*
We
skipped
out
and
looked
;
but
it
war
n't
nothing
but
the
flutter
of
a
*NL*
steamboat
's
wheel
away
down
,
coming
around
the
point

so
we
come
back

I
,

CHAPTER
XV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
We
judged
that
three
nights
more
would
fetch
us
to
Cairo
,
at
the
*NL*
bottom
of
Illinois
,
where
the
Ohio
River
comes
in
,
and
that
was
what
*NL*
we
was
after
.
We
would
sell
the
raft
and
get
on
a
steamboat
and
go
way
*NL*
up
the
Ohio
amongst
the
free
states
,
and
then
be
out
of
trouble
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
the
second
night
a
fog
begun
to
come
on
,
and
we
made
for
a
*NL*
towhead
to
tie
to
,
for
it
would
n't
do
to
try
to
run
in
a
fog
;
but
when
*NL*
I
paddled
ahead
in
the
canoe
,
with
the
line
to
make
fast
,
there
war
n't
*NL*
anything
but
little
saplings
to
tie
to
.
I
passed
the
line
around
one
*NL*
of
them
right
on
the
edge
of
the
cut
bank
,
but
there
was
a
stiff
*NL*
current
,
and
the
raft
come
booming
down
so
lively
she
tore
it
out
by
*NL*
the
roots
and
away
she
went
.
I
see
the
fog
closing
down
,
and
it
made
*NL*
me
so
sick
and
scared
I
could
n't
budge
for
most
a
half
a
minute
it
*NL*
seemed
to
me
--
and
then
there
war
n't
no
raft
in
sight
;
you
could
n't
see
*NL*
twenty
yards
.
I
jumped
into
the
canoe
and
run
back
to
the
stern
,
and
*NL*
grabbed
the
paddle
and
set
her
back
a
stroke
.
But
she
did
n't
come
.
I
*NL*
was
in
such
a
hurry
I
had
n't
untied
her
.
I
got
up
and
tried
to
untie
*NL*
her
,
but
I
was
so
excited
my
hands
shook
so
I
could
n't
hardly
do
*NL*
anything
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
I
got
started
I
took
out
after
the
raft
,
hot
and
heavy
,
*NL*
right
down
the
towhead
.
That
was
all
right
as
far
as
it
went
,
but
the
*NL*
towhead
war
n't
sixty
yards
long
,
and
the
minute
I
flew
by
the
foot
of
*NL*
it
I
shot
out
into
the
solid
white
fog
,
and
had
n't
no
more
idea
which
*NL*
way
I
was
going
than
a
dead
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thinks
I
,
it
wo
n't
do
to
paddle
;
first
I
know
I
'll
run
into
the
bank
*NL*
or
a
towhead
or
something
;
I
got
to
set
still
and
float
,
and
yet
it
's
*NL*
mighty
fidgety
business
to
have
to
hold
your
hands
still
at
such
a
*NL*
time
.
I
whooped
and
listened
.
Away
down
there
somewheres
I
hears
a
*NL*
small
whoop
,
and
up
comes
my
spirits
.
I
went
tearing
after
it
,
*NL*
listening
sharp
to
hear
it
again
.
The
next
time
it
come
I
see
I
war
n't
*NL*
heading
for
it
,
but
heading
away
to
the
right
of
it
.
And
the
next
time
*NL*
I
was
heading
away
to
the
left
of
it
--
and
not
gaining
on
it
much
*NL*
either
,
for
I
was
flying
around
,
this
way
and
that
and
t
`
other
,
but
it
*NL*
was
going
straight
ahead
all
the
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
wish
the
fool
would
think
to
beat
a
tin
pan
,
and
beat
it
all
the
*NL*
time
,
but
he
never
did
,
and
it
was
the
still
places
between
the
whoops
*NL*
that
was
making
the
trouble
for
me
.
Well
,
I
fought
along
,
and
directly
*NL*
I
hears
the
whoop
_
behind
_
me
.
I
was
tangled
good
now
.
That
was
*NL*
somebody
else
's
whoop
,
or
else
I
was
turned
around
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
throwed
the
paddle
down
.
I
heard
the
whoop
again
;
it
was
behind
me
*NL*
yet
,
but
in
a
different
place
;
it
kept
coming
,
and
kept
changing
its
*NL*
place
,
and
I
kept
answering
,
till
by
and
by
it
was
in
front
of
me
*NL*
again
,
and
I
knowed
the
current
had
swung
the
canoe
's
head
*NL*
down-stream
,
and
I
was
all
right
if
that
was
Jim
and
not
some
other
*NL*
raftsman
hollering
.
I
could
n't
tell
nothing
about
voices
in
a
fog
,
for
*NL*
nothing
do
n't
look
natural
nor
sound
natural
in
a
fog
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whooping
went
on
,
and
in
about
a
minute
I
come
a-booming
down
on
a
*NL*
cut
bank
with
smoky
ghosts
of
big
trees
on
it
,
and
the
current
throwed
*NL*
me
off
to
the
left
and
shot
by
,
amongst
a
lot
of
snags
that
fairly
*NL*
roared
,
the
current
was
tearing
by
them
so
swift
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
another
second
or
two
it
was
solid
white
and
still
again
.
I
set
*NL*
perfectly
still
then
,
listening
to
my
heart
thump
,
and
I
reckon
I
*NL*
did
n't
draw
a
breath
while
it
thumped
a
hundred
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
just
give
up
then
.
I
knowed
what
the
matter
was
.
That
cut
bank
was
*NL*
an
island
,
and
Jim
had
gone
down
t
`
other
side
of
it
.
It
war
n't
no
*NL*
towhead
that
you
could
float
by
in
ten
minutes
.
It
had
the
big
timber
*NL*
of
a
regular
island
;
it
might
be
five
or
six
miles
long
and
more
than
*NL*
half
a
mile
wide
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
kept
quiet
,
with
my
ears
cocked
,
about
fifteen
minutes
,
I
reckon
.
I
*NL*
was
floating
along
,
of
course
,
four
or
five
miles
an
hour
;
but
you
*NL*
do
n't
ever
think
of
that
.
No
,
you
_
feel
_
like
you
are
laying
dead
*NL*
still
on
the
water
;
and
if
a
little
glimpse
of
a
snag
slips
by
you
*NL*
do
n't
think
to
yourself
how
fast
_
you
're
_
going
,
but
you
catch
your
*NL*
breath
and
think
,
my
!
how
that
snag
's
tearing
along
.
If
you
think
it
*NL*
ai
n't
dismal
and
lonesome
out
in
a
fog
that
way
by
yourself
in
the
*NL*
night
,
you
try
it
once
--
you
'll
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
,
for
about
a
half
an
hour
,
I
whoops
now
and
then
;
at
last
I
hears
*NL*
the
answer
a
long
ways
off
,
and
tries
to
follow
it
,
but
I
could
n't
do
*NL*
it
,
and
directly
I
judged
I
'd
got
into
a
nest
of
towheads
,
for
I
had
*NL*
little
dim
glimpses
of
them
on
both
sides
of
me
--
sometimes
just
a
*NL*
narrow
channel
between
,
and
some
that
I
could
n't
see
I
knowed
was
*NL*
there
because
I
'd
hear
the
wash
of
the
current
against
the
old
dead
*NL*
brush
and
trash
that
hung
over
the
banks
.
Well
,
I
war
n't
long
loosing
*NL*
the
whoops
down
amongst
the
towheads
;
and
I
only
tried
to
chase
them
a
*NL*
little
while
,
anyway
,
because
it
was
worse
than
chasing
a
*NL*
Jack-o
'
-
lantern
.
You
never
knowed
a
sound
dodge
around
so
,
and
swap
*NL*
places
so
quick
and
so
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
to
claw
away
from
the
bank
pretty
lively
four
or
five
times
,
to
*NL*
keep
from
knocking
the
islands
out
of
the
river
;
and
so
I
judged
the
*NL*
raft
must
be
butting
into
the
bank
every
now
and
then
,
or
else
it
*NL*
would
get
further
ahead
and
clear
out
of
hearing
--
it
was
floating
a
*NL*
little
faster
than
what
I
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
I
seemed
to
be
in
the
open
river
again
by
and
by
,
but
I
could
n't
*NL*
hear
no
sign
of
a
whoop
nowheres
.
I
reckoned
Jim
had
fetched
up
on
a
*NL*
snag
,
maybe
,
and
it
was
all
up
with
him
.
I
was
good
and
tired
,
so
I
*NL*
laid
down
in
the
canoe
and
said
I
would
n't
bother
no
more
.
I
did
n't
*NL*
want
to
go
to
sleep
,
of
course
;
but
I
was
so
sleepy
I
could
n't
help
*NL*
it
;
so
I
thought
I
would
take
jest
one
little
cat-nap
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
reckon
it
was
more
than
a
cat-nap
,
for
when
I
waked
up
the
stars
*NL*
was
shining
bright
,
the
fog
was
all
gone
,
and
I
was
spinning
down
a
*NL*
big
bend
stern
first
.
First
I
did
n't
know
where
I
was
;
I
thought
I
was
*NL*
dreaming
;
and
when
things
began
to
come
back
to
me
they
seemed
to
come
*NL*
up
dim
out
of
last
week
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
monstrous
big
river
here
,
with
the
tallest
and
the
thickest
*NL*
kind
of
timber
on
both
banks
;
just
a
solid
wall
,
as
well
as
I
could
*NL*
see
by
the
stars
.
I
looked
away
down-stream
,
and
seen
a
black
speck
on
*NL*
the
water
.
I
took
after
it
;
but
when
I
got
to
it
it
war
n't
nothing
but
*NL*
a
couple
of
saw-logs
made
fast
together
.
Then
I
see
another
speck
,
and
*NL*
chased
that
;
then
another
,
and
this
time
I
was
right
.
It
was
the
raft
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
got
to
it
Jim
was
setting
there
with
his
head
down
between
his
*NL*
knees
,
asleep
,
with
his
right
arm
hanging
over
the
steering-oar
.
The
*NL*
other
oar
was
smashed
off
,
and
the
raft
was
littered
up
with
leaves
*NL*
and
branches
and
dirt
.
So
she
'd
had
a
rough
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
made
fast
and
laid
down
under
Jim
's
nose
on
the
raft
,
and
began
to
*NL*
gap
,
and
stretch
my
fists
out
against
Jim
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hello
,
Jim
,

I
been
asleep
?
Why
did
n't
you
stir

*NL*
*NL*
Jim
did
n't
say
nothing
for
about
five
minutes
,
but
set
there
studying
*NL*
over
it
.
Then
he
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

I

I

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
,
that
's
all
right
,
because
a
dream
does
tire
a
body
like
*NL*
everything
sometimes
.
But
this
one
was
a
staving
dream
;
tell
me
all
*NL*
about
it
,
Jim
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
Jim
went
to
work
and
told
me
the
whole
thing
right
through
,
just
as
*NL*
it
happened
,
only
he
painted
it
up
considerable
.
Then
he
said
he
must
*NL*
start
in
and
''
`
terpret
''
it
,
because
it
was
sent
for
a
warning
.
He
said
*NL*
the
first
towhead
stood
for
a
man
that
would
try
to
do
us
some
good
,
*NL*
but
the
current
was
another
man
that
would
get
us
away
from
him
.
The
*NL*
whoops
was
warnings
that
would
come
to
us
every
now
and
then
,
and
if
*NL*
we
did
n't
try
hard
to
make
out
to
understand
them
they
'd
just
take
us
*NL*
into
bad
luck
,
`
stead
of
keeping
us
out
of
it
.
The
lot
of
towheads
was
*NL*
troubles
we
was
going
to
get
into
with
quarrelsome
people
and
all
*NL*
kinds
of
mean
folks
,
but
if
we
minded
our
business
and
did
n't
talk
*NL*
back
and
aggravate
them
,
we
would
pull
through
and
get
out
of
the
fog
*NL*
and
into
the
big
clear
river
,
which
was
the
free
states
,
and
would
n't
*NL*
have
no
more
trouble
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
clouded
up
pretty
dark
just
after
I
got
on
to
the
raft
,
but
it
*NL*
was
clearing
up
again
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
,
that
's
all
interpreted
well
enough
as
far
as
it
goes
,
Jim
,
''
*NL*
I
says
;
``
but
what
does
_
these
_
things
stand
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
leaves
and
rubbish
on
the
raft
and
the
smashed
oar
.
You
*NL*
could
see
them
first-rate
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jim
looked
at
the
trash
,
and
then
looked
at
me
,
and
back
at
the
trash
*NL*
again
.
He
had
got
the
dream
fixed
so
strong
in
his
head
that
he
*NL*
could
n't
seem
to
shake
it
loose
and
get
the
facts
back
into
its
place
*NL*
again
right
away
.
But
when
he
did
get
the
thing
straightened
around
he
*NL*
looked
at
me
steady
without
ever
smiling
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do

I
's
gwyne
to
tell

*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
got
up
slow
and
walked
to
the
wigwam
,
and
went
in
there
*NL*
without
saying
anything
but
that
.
But
that
was
enough
.
It
made
me
feel
*NL*
so
mean
I
could
almost
kissed
_
his
_
foot
to
get
him
to
take
it
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
fifteen
minutes
before
I
could
work
myself
up
to
go
and
humble
*NL*
myself
to
a
nigger
;
but
I
done
it
,
and
I
war
n't
ever
sorry
for
it
*NL*
afterward
,
neither
.
I
did
n't
do
him
no
more
mean
tricks
,
and
I
*NL*
would
n't
done
that
one
if
I

CHAPTER
XVI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
We
slept
most
all
day
,
and
started
out
at
night
,
a
little
ways
behind
*NL*
a
monstrous
long
raft
that
was
as
long
going
by
as
a
procession
.
She
*NL*
had
four
long
sweeps
at
each
end
,
so
we
judged
she
carried
as
many
as
*NL*
thirty
men
,
likely
.
She
had
five
big
wigwams
aboard
,
wide
apart
,
and
*NL*
an
open
camp-fire
in
the
middle
,
and
a
tall
flag-pole
at
each
end
.
*NL*
There
was
a
power
of
style
about
her
.
It
_
amounted
_
to
something
being
*NL*
a
raftsman
on
such
a
craft
as
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
went
drifting
down
into
a
big
bend
,
and
the
night
clouded
up
and
*NL*
got
hot
.
The
river
was
very
wide
,
and
was
walled
with
solid
timber
on
*NL*
both
sides
;
you
could
n't
see
a
break
in
it
hardly
ever
,
or
a
light
.
We
*NL*
talked
about
Cairo
,
and
wondered
whether
we
would
know
it
when
we
got
*NL*
to
it
.
I
said
likely
we
would
n't
,
because
I
had
heard
say
there
war
n't
*NL*
but
about
a
dozen
houses
there
,
and
if
they
did
n't
happen
to
have
them
*NL*
lit
up
,
how
was
we
going
to
know
we
was
passing
a
town
?
Jim
said
if
*NL*
the
two
big
rivers
joined
together
there
,
that
would
show
.
But
I
said
*NL*
maybe
we
might
think
we
was
passing
the
foot
of
an
island
and
coming
*NL*
into
the
same
old
river
again
.
That
disturbed
Jim
--
and
me
too
.
So
the
*NL*
question
was
,
what
to
do
?
I
said
,
paddle
ashore
the
first
time
a
light
*NL*
showed
,
and
tell
them
pap
was
behind
,
coming
along
with
a
*NL*
trading-scow
,
and
was
a
green
hand
at
the
business
,
and
wanted
to
know
*NL*
how
far
it
was
to
Cairo
.
Jim
thought
it
was
a
good
idea
,
so
we
took
a
*NL*
smoke
on
it
and
waited
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
war
n't
nothing
to
do
now
but
to
look
out
sharp
for
the
town
,
and
*NL*
not
pass
it
without
seeing
it
.
He
said
he
'd
be
mighty
sure
to
see
it
,
*NL*
because
he
'd
be
a
free
man
the
minute
he
seen
it
,
but
if
he
missed
it
*NL*
he
'd
be
in
a
slave
country
again
and
no
more
show
for
freedom
.
Every
*NL*
little
while
he
jumps
up
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dah
she
is
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
war
n't
.
It
was
Jack-o
'
-
lanterns
,
or
lightning-bugs
;
so
he
set
*NL*
down
again
,
and
went
to
watching
,
same
as
before
.
Jim
said
it
made
him
*NL*
all
over
trembly
and
feverish
to
be
so
close
to
freedom
.
Well
,
I
can
*NL*
tell
you
it
made
me
all
over
trembly
and
feverish
,
too
,
to
hear
him
,
*NL*
because
I
begun
to
get
it
through
my
head
that
he
_
was
_
most
free
--
and
*NL*
who
was
to
blame
for
it
?
Why
,
_
me
_
.
I
could
n't
get
that
out
of
my
*NL*
conscience
,
no
how
nor
no
way
.
It
got
to
troubling
me
so
I
could
n't
*NL*
rest
;
I
could
n't
stay
still
in
one
place
.
It
had
n't
ever
come
home
to
*NL*
me
before
,
what
this
thing
was
that
I
was
doing
.
But
now
it
did
;
and
*NL*
it
stayed
with
me
,
and
scorched
me
more
and
more
.
I
tried
to
make
out
*NL*
to
myself
that
_
I
_
war
n't
to
blame
,
because
_
I
_
did
n't
run
Jim
off
*NL*
from
his
rightful
owner
;
but
it
war
n't
no
use
,
conscience
up
and
says
,
*NL*
every
time
,
``
But
you
knowed
he
was
running
for
his
freedom
,
and
you
*NL*
could
`
a
'
paddled
ashore
and
told
somebody
.
''
That
was
so
--
I
could
n't
*NL*
get
around
that
no
way
.
That
was
where
it
pinched
.
Conscience
says
to
*NL*
me
,
``
What
had
poor
Miss
Watson
done
to
you
that
you
could
see
her
*NL*
nigger
go
off
right
under
your
eyes
and
never
say
one
single
word
?
*NL*
What
did
that
poor
old
woman
do
to
you
that
you
could
treat
her
so
*NL*
mean
?
Why
,
she
tried
to
learn
you
your
book
,
she
tried
to
learn
you
*NL*
your
manners
,
she
tried
to
be
good
to
you
every
way
she
knowed
how
.
*NL*
_
That
's
_
what
she
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
got
to
feeling
so
mean
and
so
miserable
I
most
wished
I
was
dead
.
I
*NL*
fidgeted
up
and
down
the
raft
,
abusing
myself
to
myself
,
and
Jim
was
*NL*
fidgeting
up
and
down
past
me
.
We
neither
of
us
could
keep
still
.
*NL*
Every
time
he
danced
around
and
says
,
``
Dah
's
Cairo
!
''
it
went
through
*NL*
me
like
a
shot
,
and
I
thought
if
it
_
was
_
Cairo
I
reckoned
I
would
die
*NL*
of
miserableness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jim
talked
out
loud
all
the
time
while
I
was
talking
to
myself
.
He
was
*NL*
saying
how
the
first
thing
he
would
do
when
he
got
to
a
free
state
he
*NL*
would
go
to
saving
up
money
and
never
spend
a
single
cent
,
and
when
he
*NL*
got
enough
he
would
buy
his
wife
,
which
was
owned
on
a
farm
close
to
*NL*
where
Miss
Watson
lived
;
and
then
they
would
both
work
to
buy
the
two
*NL*
children
,
and
if
their
master
would
n't
sell
them
,
they
'd
get
an
*NL*
Ab
`
litionist
to
go
and
steal
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
most
froze
me
to
hear
such
talk
.
He
would
n't
ever
dared
to
talk
*NL*
such
talk
in
his
life
before
.
Just
see
what
a
difference
it
made
in
*NL*
him
the
minute
he
judged
he
was
about
free
.
It
was
according
to
the
*NL*
old
saying
,
``
Give
a
nigger
an
inch
and
he
'll
take
an
ell
.
''
Thinks
I
,
*NL*
this
is
what
comes
of
my
not
thinking
.
Here
was
this
nigger
,
which
I
*NL*
had
as
good
as
helped
to
run
away
,
coming
right
out
flat-footed
and
*NL*
saying
he
would
steal
his
children
--
children
that
belonged
to
a
man
I
*NL*
did
n't
even
know
;
a
man
that
had
n't
ever
done
me
no
harm
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
sorry
to
hear
Jim
say
that
,
it
was
such
a
lowering
of
him
.
My
*NL*
conscience
got
to
stirring
me
up
hotter
than
ever
,
until
at
last
I
*NL*
says
to
it
,
``
Let
up
on
me
--
it
ai
n't
too
late
yet
--
I
'll
paddle
ashore
*NL*
at
the
first
light
and
tell
.
''
I
felt
easy
and
happy
and
light
as
a
*NL*
feather
right
off
.
All
my
troubles
was
gone
.
I
went
to
looking
out
*NL*
sharp
for
a
light
,
and
sort
of
singing
to
myself
.
By
and
by
one
*NL*
showed
.
Jim
sings
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
's
safe
,
Huck
,
we
's
safe
!
Jump
up
and
crack
yo
'
heels
!
Dat
's
de
*NL*
good

at
las
'
,
I
jis
knows
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
take
the
canoe
and
go
and
see
,
Jim
.
It
might
n't
be
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
jumped
and
got
the
canoe
ready
,
and
put
his
old
coat
in
the
bottom
*NL*
for
me
to
set
on
,
and
give
me
the
paddle
;
and
as
I
shoved
off
,
he
*NL*
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pooty
soon
I
'll
be
a-shout
'n'
for
joy
,
en
I
'll
say
,
it
's
all
on
*NL*
accounts
o

Huck
;
I
's
a
free
man
,
en
I
could
n't
ever
ben
free
ef

*NL*
hadn

ben

Huck
done
it

now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
paddling
off
,
all
in
a
sweat
to
tell
on
him
;
but
when
he
says
*NL*
this
,
it
seemed
to
kind
of
take
the
tuck
all
out
of
me
.
I
went
along
*NL*
slow
then
,
and
I
war
n't
right
down
certain
whether
I
was
glad
I
*NL*
started
or
whether
I
war
n't
.
When
I
was
fifty
yards
off
,
Jim
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dah
you
goes
,
de
ole
true
Huck
;
de
on
'
y
white
genlman

*NL*
his
promise
to

Jim
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
I
just
felt
sick
.
But
I
says
,
I
_
got
_
to
do
it
--
I
ca
n't
get
*NL*
_
out
_
of
it
.
Right
then
along
comes
a
skiff
with
two
men
in
it
with
*NL*
guns
,
and
they
stopped
and
I
stopped
.
One
of
them
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
that
yonder
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
piece
of
a
raft
,
''
I
says
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
belong
on
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Any
men
on
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
there
's
five
niggers

off
to-night

yonder

above

.
Is
your
man
white
or
black
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
n't
answer
up
prompt
.
I
tried
to
,
but
the
words
would
n't
come
.
I
*NL*
tried
for
a
second
or
two
to
brace
up
and
out
with
it
,
but
I
war
n't
*NL*
man
enough
--
had
n't
the
spunk
of
a
rabbit
.
I
see
I
was
weakening
;
so
I
*NL*
just
give
up
trying
,
and
up
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
white
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
reckon
we
'll
go
and
see
for
ourselves

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish

says
I
,
``

*NL*
*NL*
I
buckled
to
my
paddle
and
they
laid
to
their
oars
.
When
we
had
made
a
*NL*
stroke
or
two
,
I
says
:

They
stopped
pulling

a
mighty
little

says

.
If
you
see
any
runaway
niggers
*NL*
you
get
help
and
nab
them
,
and
you
can
make
some
money
by
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-by
,
sir
,
''
says
I
;
``
I
wo
n't
let
no
runaway
niggers
get
by
me
if
I
*NL*
can
help
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
off
and
I
got
aboard
the
raft
,
feeling
bad
and
low
,
because
*NL*
I
knowed
very
well
I
had
done
wrong
,
and
I
see
it
war
n't
no
use
for
me
*NL*
to
try
to
learn
to
do
right
;
a
body
that
do
n't
get
_
started
_
right
*NL*
when
he
's
little
ai
n't
got
no
show
--
when
the
pinch
comes
there
ai
n't
*NL*
nothing
to
back
him
up
and
keep
him
to
his
work
,
and
so
he
gets
beat
.
*NL*
Then
I
thought
a
minute
,
and
says
to
myself
,
hold
on
;
s
`
pose
you
'd
`
a
'
*NL*
done
right
and
give
Jim
up
,
would
you
felt
better
than
what
you
do
*NL*
now
?
No
,
says
I
,
I
'd
feel
bad
--
I
'd
feel
just
the
same
way
I
do
now
.
*NL*
Well
,
then
,
says
I
,
what
's
the
use
you
learning
to
do
right
when
it
's
*NL*
troublesome
to
do
right
and
ai
n't
no
trouble
to
do
wrong
,
and
the
*NL*
wages
is
just
the
same
?
I
was
stuck
.
I
could
n't
answer
that
.
So
I
*NL*
reckoned
I
would
n't
bother
no
more
about
it
,
but
after
this
always
do
*NL*
whichever
come
handiest
at
the
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
into
the
wigwam
;
Jim
war
n't
there
.
I
looked
all
around
;
he
*NL*
war
n't
anywhere
.
I
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jim
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
I
is
,
Huck
.
Is
dey
out
o
'
sight
yit
?
Do
n't
talk
loud
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
in
the
river
under
the
stern
oar
,
with
just
his
nose
out
.
I
*NL*
told
him
they
were
out
of
sight
,
so
he
come
aboard
.
He
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
a-listenin
'
to
all
de
talk
,
en
I
slips
into
de
river
en

*NL*
gwyne
to

.
Den
I
was
gwyne
to
swim
to
*NL*

But
lawsy
,
how
you
did

Huck
!
*NL*
Dat

I
tell

I

Jim
--
ole
Jim
ai
n't
going
to
forgit
you
for
dat
,
honey
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
we
talked
about
the
money
.
It
was
a
pretty
good
raise
--
twenty
*NL*
dollars
apiece
.
Jim
said
we
could
take
deck
passage
on
a
steamboat
*NL*
now
,
and
the
money
would
last
us
as
far
as
we
wanted
to
go
in
the
free
*NL*
states
.
He
said
twenty
mile
more
war
n't
far
for
the
raft
to
go
,
but
he
*NL*
wished
we
was
already
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
daybreak
we
tied
up
,
and
Jim
was
mighty
particular
about
*NL*
hiding
the
raft
good
.
Then
he
worked
all
day
fixing
things
in
bundles
,
*NL*
and
getting
all
ready
to
quit
rafting
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
night
about
ten
we
hove
in
sight
of
the
lights
of
a
town
away
*NL*
down
in
a
left-hand
bend
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
off
in
the
canoe
to
ask
about
it
.
Pretty
soon
I
found
a
man
out
*NL*
in
the
river
with
a
skiff
,
setting
a
trot-line
.
I
ranged
up
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mister
,
is
that
town
Cairo
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cairo
?
no
.
You
must
be
a
blame
'
fool
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
town
is
it
,
mister
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
want
to
know
,
go
and
find
out
.
If
you
stay
here
botherin
'
*NL*
around
me
for
about
a
half
a
minute
longer
you
'll
get
something
you
*NL*
wo
n't
want
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
paddled
to
the
raft
.
Jim
was
awful
disappointed
,
but
I
said
never
*NL*
mind
,
Cairo
would
be
the
next
place
,
I
reckoned
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
passed
another
town
before
daylight
,
and
I
was
going
out
again
;
but
*NL*
it
was
high
ground
,
so
I
did
n't
go
.
No
high
ground
about
Cairo
,
Jim
*NL*
said
.
I
had
forgot
it
.
We
laid
up
for
the
day
on
a
towhead
tolerable
*NL*
close
to
the
left-hand
bank
.
I
begun
to
suspicion
something
.
So
did
*NL*
Jim
.
I
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maybe
we
went
by
Cairo
in
the
fog
that
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doan
'
le
's
talk
about
it
,
Huck
.
Po
'
niggers
ca
n't
have
no
luck
.
I
*NL*
awluz
`
spected
dat
rattlesnake-skin
war
n't
done
wid
its
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
I
'd
never
seen
that
snake-skin
,
Jim
--
I
do
wish
I
'd
never
laid
*NL*
eyes
on
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
ai
n't
yo
'
fault
,
Huck
;
you
did
n't
know
.
Do
n't
you
blame
yo
`
self
*NL*
`
bout
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
it
was
daylight
,
here
was
the
clear
Ohio
water
inshore
,
sure
*NL*
enough
,
and
outside
was
the
old
regular
Muddy
!
So
it
was
all
up
with
*NL*
Cairo
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
talked
it
all
over
.
It
would
n't
do
to
take
to
the
shore
;
we
*NL*
could
n't
take
the
raft
up
the
stream
,
of
course
.
There
war
n't
no
way
*NL*
but
to
wait
for
dark
,
and
start
back
in
the
canoe
and
take
the
*NL*
chances
.
So
we
slept
all
day
amongst
the
cottonwood
thicket
,
so
as
to
*NL*
be
fresh
for
the
work
,
and
when
we
went
back
to
the
raft
about
dark
*NL*
the
canoe
was
gone
!
*NL*
*NL*
We
did
n't
say
a
word
for
a
good
while
.
There
war
n't
anything
to
say
.
*NL*
We
both
knowed
well
enough
it
was
some
more
work
of
the
*NL*
rattlesnake-skin
;
so
what
was
the
use
to
talk
about
it
?
It
would
only
*NL*
look
like
we
was
finding
fault
,
and
that
would
be
bound
to
fetch
more
*NL*
bad
luck
--
and
keep
on
fetching
it
,
too
,
till
we
knowed
enough
to
keep
*NL*
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
and
by
we
talked
about
what
we
better
do
,
and
found
there
war
n't
no
*NL*
way
but
just
to
go
along
down
with
the
raft
till
we
got
a
chance
to
*NL*
buy
a
canoe
to
go
back
in
.
We
war
n't
going
to
borrow
it
when
there
*NL*
war
n't
anybody
around
,
the
way
pap
would
do
,
for
that
might
set
people
*NL*
after
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
we
shoved
out
after
dark
on
the
raft
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anybody
that
do
n't
believe
yet
that
it
's
foolishness
to
handle
a
*NL*
snake-skin
,
after
all
that
that
snake-skin
done
for
us
,
will
believe
*NL*
it
now
if
they
read
on
and
see
what
more
it
done
for
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
place
to
buy
canoes
is
off
of
rafts
laying
up
at
shore
.
But
we
*NL*
did
n't
see
no
rafts
laying
up
;
so
we
went
along
during
three
hours
and
*NL*
more
.
Well
,
the
night
got
gray
and
ruther
thick
,
which
is
the
next
*NL*
meanest
thing
to
fog
.
You
ca
n't
tell
the
shape
of
the
river
,
and
you
*NL*
ca
n't
see
no
distance
.
It
got
to
be
very
late
and
still
,
and
then
*NL*
along
comes
a
steamboat
up
the
river
.
We
lit
the
lantern
,
and
judged
*NL*
she
would
see
it
.
Up-stream
boats
did
n't
generly
come
close
to
us
;
*NL*
they
go
out
and
follow
the
bars
and
hunt
for
easy
water
under
the
*NL*
reefs
;
but
nights
like
this
they
bull
right
up
the
channel
against
the
*NL*
whole
river
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
could
hear
her
pounding
along
,
but
we
did
n't
see
her
good
till
she
*NL*
was
close
.
She
aimed
right
for
us
.
Often
they
do
that
and
try
to
see
*NL*
how
close
they
can
come
without
touching
;
sometimes
the
wheel
bites
*NL*
off
a
sweep
,
and
then
the
pilot
sticks
his
head
out
and
laughs
,
and
*NL*
thinks
he
's
mighty
smart
.
Well
,
here
she
comes
,
and
we
said
she
was
*NL*
going
to
try
and
shave
us
;
but
she
did
n't
seem
to
be
sheering
off
a
*NL*
bit
.
She
was
a
big
one
,
and
she
was
coming
in
a
hurry
,
too
,
looking
*NL*
like
a
black
cloud
with
rows
of
glow-worms
around
it
;
but
all
of
a
*NL*
sudden
she
bulged
out
,
big
and
scary
,
with
a
long
row
of
wide-open
*NL*
furnace
doors
shining
like
red-hot
teeth
,
and
her
monstrous
bows
and
*NL*
guards
hanging
right
over
us
.
There
was
a
yell
at
us
,
and
a
jingling
*NL*
of
bells
to
stop
the
engines
,
a
powwow
of
cussing
,
and
whistling
of
*NL*
steam
--
and
as
Jim
went
overboard
on
one
side
and
I
on
the
other
,
she
*NL*
come
smashing
straight
through
the
raft
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
dived
--
and
I
aimed
to
find
the
bottom
,
too
,
for
a
thirty-foot
wheel
*NL*
had
got
to
go
over
me
,
and
I
wanted
it
to
have
plenty
of
room
.
I
could
*NL*
always
stay
under
water
a
minute
;
this
time
I
reckon
I
stayed
under
a
*NL*
minute
and
a
half
.
Then
I
bounced
for
the
top
in
a
hurry
,
for
I
was
*NL*
nearly
busting
.
I
popped
out
to
my
armpits
and
blowed
the
water
out
of
*NL*
my
nose
,
and
puffed
a
bit
.
Of
course
there
was
a
booming
current
;
and
*NL*
of
course
that
boat
started
her
engines
again
ten
seconds
after
she
*NL*
stopped
them
,
for
they
never
cared
much
for
raftsmen
;
so
now
she
was
*NL*
churning
along
up
the
river
,
out
of
sight
in
the
thick
weather
,
though
*NL*
I
could
hear
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
sung
out
for
Jim
about
a
dozen
times
,
but
I
did
n't
get
any
answer
;
*NL*
so
I
grabbed
a
plank
that
touched
me
while
I
was
``
treading
water
,
''
and
*NL*
struck
out
for
shore
,
shoving
it
ahead
of
me
.
But
I
made
out
to
see
*NL*
that
the
drift
of
the
current
was
towards
the
left-hand
shore
,
which
*NL*
meant
that
I
was
in
a
crossing
;
so
I
changed
off
and
went
that
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
one
of
these
long
,
slanting
,
two-mile
crossings
;
so
I
was
a
*NL*
good
long
time
in
getting
over
.
I
made
a
safe
landing
,
and
clumb
up
*NL*
the
bank
.
I
could
n't
see
but
a
little
ways
,
but
I
went
poking
along
*NL*
over
rough
ground
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
or
more
,
and
then
I
run
*NL*
across
a
big
old-fashioned
double
log
house
before
I
noticed
it
.
I
was
*NL*
going
to
rush
by
and
get
away
,
but
a
lot
of
dogs
jumped
out
and
went
*NL*
to
howling
and
barking
at
me
,
and
I
knowed
better
than
to
move
another
*NL*
peg
.
*NL*

CHAPTER
XVII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
about
a
minute
somebody
spoke
out
of
a
window
without
putting
his
*NL*
head
out
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
done

!
Who
's

*NL*
*NL*
I
says

``

wo

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What

time
of

for

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

I
fell

off
of

*NL*
``

But

``
No

*NL*
*NL*
I
heard
the
people
stirring
around
in
the
house
now
,
and
see
a
light
.
*NL*
The
man
sung
out
:
``

*NL*
*NL*
I
did
n't
hurry
;
I
could
n't
if
I
'd
a-wanted
to
.
I
took
one
slow
step
at
*NL*
a
time
and
there
war
n't
a
sound
,
only
I
thought
I
could
hear
my
heart
.
*NL*
The
dogs
were
as
still
as
the
humans
,
but
they
followed
a
little
*NL*
behind
me
.
When
I
got
to
the
three
log
doorsteps
I
heard
them
*NL*
unlocking
and
unbarring
and
unbolting
.
I
put
my
hand
on
the
door
and
*NL*
pushed
it
a
little
and
a
little
more
till
somebody
said
,
``
There
,
*NL*
that
's
enough
--
put
your
head
in
.
''
I
done
it
,
but
I
judged
they
would
*NL*
take
it
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
candle
was
on
the
floor
,
and
there
they
all
was
,
looking
at
me
,
*NL*
and
me
at
them
,
for
about
a
quarter
of
a
minute
:
Three
big
men
with
*NL*
guns
pointed
at
me
,
which
made
me
wince
,
I
tell
you
;
the
oldest
,
gray
*NL*
and
about
sixty
,
the
other
two
thirty
or
more
--
all
of
them
fine
and
*NL*
handsome
--
and
the
sweetest
old
gray-headed
lady
,
and
back
of
her
two
*NL*
young
women
which
I
could
n't
see
right
well
.
The
old
gentleman
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
;
I
reckon
it
's
all
right
.
Come
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
I
was
in
the
old
gentleman
he
locked
the
door
and
barred
it
*NL*
and
bolted
it
,
and
told
the
young
men
to
come
in
with
their
guns
,
and
*NL*
they
all
went
in
a
big
parlor
that
had
a
new
rag
carpet
on
the
floor
,
*NL*
and
got
together
in
a
corner
that
was
out
of
the
range
of
the
front
*NL*
windows
--
there
war
n't
none
on
the
side
.
They
held
the
candle
,
and
took
*NL*
a
good
look
at
me
,
and
all
said
,
``
Why
,
_
he
_
ai
n't
a
Shepherdson
--
no
,
*NL*
there
ai
n't
any
Shepherdson
about
him
.
''
Then
the
old
man
said
he
hoped
*NL*
I
would
n't
mind
being
searched
for
arms
,
because
he
did
n't
mean
no
*NL*
harm
by
it
--
it
was
only
to
make
sure
.
So
he
did
n't
pry
into
my
*NL*
pockets
,
but
only
felt
outside
with
his
hands
,
and
said
it
was
all
*NL*
right
.
He
told
me
to
make
myself
easy
and
at
home
,
and
tell
all
about
*NL*
myself
;
but
the
old
lady
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
bless
you
,
Saul
,
the
poor
thing
's
as
wet
as
he
can
be
;
and
do
n't
*NL*
you
reckon
it
may
be
he
's
hungry
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
for
you
,
Rachel
--
I
forgot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
old
lady
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Betsy
''
-LRB-
this
was
a
nigger
woman
-RRB-
,
``
you
fly
around
and
get
him
*NL*
something
to
eat
as
quick
as
you
can
,
poor
thing
;
and
one
of
you
girls
*NL*
go
and
wake
up
Buck
and
tell
him
--
oh
,
here
he
is
himself
.
Buck
,
take
*NL*
this
little
stranger
and
get
the
wet
clothes
off
from
him
and
dress
*NL*
him
up
in
some
of
yours
that
's
dry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Buck
looked
about
as
old
as
me
--
thirteen
or
fourteen
or
along
there
,
*NL*
though
he
was
a
little
bigger
than
me
.
He
had
n't
on
anything
but
a
*NL*
shirt
,
and
he
was
very
frowzy-headed
.
He
came
in
gaping
and
digging
*NL*
one
fist
into
his
eyes
,
and
he
was
dragging
a
gun
along
with
the
other
*NL*
one
.
He
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ai
n't
they
no
Shepherdsons
around
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
said
,
no
,
't
was
a
false
alarm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
says
,
``
if
they
'd
`
a
'
ben
some
,
I
reckon
I
'd
`
a
'
got
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
all
laughed
,
and
Bob
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Buck
,
they
might
have
scalped
us
all
,
you
've
been
so
slow
in
*NL*
coming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
nobody
come
after
me
,
and
it
ai
n't
right
.
I
'm
always
kept
down
;
*NL*
I
do
n't
get
no
show
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
,
Buck
,
my
boy
,
''
says
the
old
man
,
``
you
'll
have
show
*NL*
enough
,
all
in
good
time
,
do
n't
you
fret
about
that
.
Go
`
long
with
you
*NL*
now
,
and
do
as
your
mother
told
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
got
up-stairs
to
his
room
he
got
me
a
coarse
shirt
and
a
*NL*
roundabout
and
pants
of
his
,
and
I
put
them
on
.
While
I
was
at
it
he
*NL*
asked
me
what
my
name
was
,
but
before
I
could
tell
him
he
started
to
*NL*
tell
me
about
a
bluejay
and
a
young
rabbit
he
had
catched
in
the
woods
*NL*
day
before
yesterday
,
and
he
asked
me
where
Moses
was
when
the
candle
*NL*
went
out
.
I
said
I
did
n't
know
;
I
had
n't
heard
about
it
before
,
no
*NL*
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
guess
,
''
he
says
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
'm
I
going
to
guess
,
''
says
I
,
``
when
I
never
heard
tell
of
it
*NL*
before
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
can
guess
,
ca
n't
you
?
It
's
just
as
easy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Which
_
candle
?
''
I
says
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
any
candle
,
''
he
says
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
where
he
was
,
''
says
I
;
``
where
was
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
he
was
in
the
_
dark
_
!
That
's
where
he
was
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
if
you
knowed
where
he
was
,
what
did
you
ask
me
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
blame
it
,
it
's
a
riddle
,
do
n't
you
see
?
Say
,
how
long
are
you
*NL*
going
to
stay
here
?
You
got
to
stay
always
.
We
can
just
have
booming
*NL*
times
--
they
do
n't
have
no
school
now
.
Do
you
own
a
dog
?
I
've
got
a
*NL*
dog
--
and
he
'll
go
in
the
river
and
bring
out
chips
that
you
throw
in

*NL*
Do
you
like
to
comb
up
Sundays
,
and
all
that
kind
of
foolishness

You
*NL*
bet
I
do
n't
,
but
ma
she
makes
me

Confound
these
ole
britches

I
*NL*
reckon
I
'd
better
put
'em
on
,
but
I
'd
ruther
not
,
it
's
so
warm
.
Are
*NL*
you
all
ready
?
All
right

Come
along
,
old
hoss

''
*NL*
*NL*
Cold
corn-pone
,
cold
corn-beef
,
butter
and
buttermilk
--
that
is
what
*NL*
they
had
for
me
down
there
,
and
there
ai
n't
nothing
better
that
ever
*NL*
I
've
come
across
yet
.
Buck
and
his
ma
and
all
of
them
smoked
cob
*NL*
pipes
,
except
the
nigger
woman
,
which
was
gone
,
and
the
two
young
*NL*
women
.
They
all
smoked
and
talked
,
and
I
eat
and
talked
.
The
young
*NL*
women
had
quilts
around
them
,
and
their
hair
down
their
backs
.
They
*NL*
all
asked
me
questions
,
and
I
told
them
how
pap
and
me
and
all
the
*NL*
family
was
living
on
a
little
farm
down
at
the
bottom
of
Arkansaw
,
and
*NL*
my
sister
Mary
Ann
run
off
and
got
married
and
never
was
heard
of
no
*NL*
more
,
and
Bill
went
to
hunt
them
and
he
war
n't
heard
of
no
more
,
and
*NL*
Tom
and
Mort
died
,
and
then
there
war
n't
nobody
but
just
me
and
pap
*NL*
left
,
and
he
was
just
trimmed
down
to
nothing
,
on
account
of
his
*NL*
troubles
;
so
when
he
died
I
took
what
there
was
left
,
because
the
farm
*NL*
did
n't
belong
to
us
,
and
started
up
the
river
,
deck
passage
,
and
fell
*NL*
overboard
;
and
that
was
how
I
come
to
be
here
.
So
they
said
I
could
*NL*
have
a
home
there
as
long
as
I
wanted
it
.
Then
it
was
most
daylight
*NL*
and
everybody
went
to
bed
,
and
I
went
to
bed
with
Buck
,
and
when
I
*NL*
waked
up
in
the
morning
,
drat
it
all
,
I
had
forgot
what
my
name
was
.
*NL*
So
I
laid
there
about
an
hour
trying
to
think
,
and
when
Buck
waked
up
*NL*
I
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
spell
,
Buck
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
says
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
bet
you
ca
n't
spell
my
name
,
''
says
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
bet
you
what
you
dare
I
can
,
''
says
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
says
I
,
``
go
ahead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
G-e-o-r-g-e
J-a-x-o-n
--
there
now
,
''
he
says
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
says
I
,
``
you
done
it
,
but
I
did
n't
think
you
could
.
It
ai
n't
*NL*
no
slouch
of
a
name
to
spell
--
right
off
without
studying
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
set
it
down
,
private
,
because
somebody
might
want
_
me
_
to
spell
it
*NL*
next
,
and
so
I
wanted
to
be
handy
with
it
and
rattle
it
off
like
I
was
*NL*
used
to
it
.
It
was
a
mighty
nice
family
,
and
a
mighty
nice
house
,
too
.
*NL*
I
had
n't
seen
no
house
out
in
the
country
before
that
was
so
nice
and
*NL*
had
so
much
style
.
It
did
n't
have
an
iron
latch
on
the
front
door
,
nor
*NL*
a
wooden
one
with
a
buckskin
string
,
but
a
brass
knob
to
turn
,
the
*NL*
same
as
houses
in
town
.
There
war
n't
no
bed
in
the
parlor
,
nor
a
sign
*NL*
of
a
bed
;
but
heaps
of
parlors
in
towns
has
beds
in
them
.
There
was
a
*NL*
big
fireplace
that
was
bricked
on
the
bottom
,
and
the
bricks
was
kept
*NL*
clean
and
red
by
pouring
water
on
them
and
scrubbing
them
with
another
*NL*
brick
;
sometimes
they
wash
them
over
with
red
water-paint
that
they
*NL*
call
Spanish-brown
,
same
as
they
do
in
town
.
They
had
big
brass
*NL*
dog-irons
that
could
hold
up
a
saw-log
.
There
was
a
clock
on
the
*NL*
middle
of
the
mantelpiece
,
with
a
picture
of
a
town
painted
on
the
*NL*
bottom
half
of
the
glass
front
,
and
a
round
place
in
the
middle
of
it
*NL*
for
the
sun
,
and
you
could
see
the
pendulum
swinging
behind
it
.
It
was
*NL*
beautiful
to
hear
that
clock
tick
;
and
sometimes
when
one
of
these
*NL*
peddlers
had
been
along
and
scoured
her
up
and
got
her
in
good
shape
,
*NL*
she
would
start
in
and
strike
a
hundred
and
fifty
before
she
got
*NL*
tuckered
out
.
They
would
n't
took
any
money
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
there
was
a
big
outlandish
parrot
on
each
side
of
the
clock
,
*NL*
made
out
of
something
like
chalk
,
and
painted
up
gaudy
.
By
one
of
the
*NL*
parrots
was
a
cat
made
of
crockery
,
and
a
crockery
dog
by
the
other
;
*NL*
and
when
you
pressed
down
on
them
they
squeaked
,
but
did
n't
open
their
*NL*
mouths
nor
look
different
nor
interested
.
They
squeaked
through
*NL*
underneath
.
There
was
a
couple
of
big
wild-turkey-wing
fans
spread
out
*NL*
behind
those
things
.
On
the
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
was
a
kind
*NL*
of
a
lovely
crockery
basket
that
had
apples
and
oranges
and
peaches
*NL*
and
grapes
piled
up
in
it
,
which
was
much
redder
and
yellower
and
*NL*
prettier
than
real
ones
is
,
but
they
war
n't
real
because
you
could
see
*NL*
where
pieces
had
got
chipped
off
and
showed
the
white
chalk
,
or
*NL*
whatever
it
was
,
underneath
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
table
had
a
cover
made
out
of
beautiful
oilcloth
,
with
a
red
and
*NL*
blue
spread-eagle
painted
on
it
,
and
a
painted
border
all
around
.
It
*NL*
come
all
the
way
from
Philadelphia
,
they
said
.
There
was
some
books
,
*NL*
too
,
piled
up
perfectly
exact
,
on
each
corner
of
the
table
.
One
was
a
*NL*
big
family
Bible
full
of
pictures
.
One
was
Pilgrim
's
Progress
,
about
a
*NL*
man
that
left
his
family
,
it
did
n't
say
why
.
I
read
considerable
in
it
*NL*
now
and
then
.
The
statements
was
interesting
,
but
tough
.
Another
was
*NL*
Friendship
's
Offering
,
full
of
beautiful
stuff
and
poetry
;
but
I
*NL*
did
n't
read
the
poetry
.
Another
was
Henry
Clay
's
Speeches
,
and
another
*NL*
was
Dr.
Gunn
's
Family
Medicine
,
which
told
you
all
about
what
to
do
if
*NL*
a
body
was
sick
or
dead
.
There
was
a
hymn-book
,
and
a
lot
of
other
*NL*
books
.
And
there
was
nice
split-bottom
chairs
,
and
perfectly
sound
,
*NL*
too
--
not
bagged
down
in
the
middle
and
busted
,
like
an
old
basket
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
pictures
hung
on
the
walls
--
mainly
Washingtons
and
*NL*
Lafayettes
,
and
battles
,
and
Highland
Marys
,
and
one
called
``
Signing
*NL*
the
Declaration
.
''
There
was
some
that
they
called
crayons
,
which
one
*NL*
of
the
daughters
which
was
dead
made
her
own
self
when
she
was
only
*NL*
fifteen
years
old
.
They
was
different
from
any
pictures
I
ever
see
*NL*
before
--
blacker
,
mostly
,
than
is
common
.
One
was
a
woman
in
a
slim
*NL*
black
dress
,
belted
small
under
the
armpits
,
with
bulges
like
a
*NL*
cabbage
in
the
middle
of
the
sleeves
,
and
a
large
black
scoop-shovel
*NL*
bonnet
with
a
black
veil
,
and
white
slim
ankles
crossed
about
with
*NL*
black
tape
,
and
very
wee
black
slippers
,
like
a
chisel
,
and
she
was
*NL*
leaning
pensive
on
a
tombstone
on
her
right
elbow
,
under
a
weeping
*NL*
willow
,
and
her
other
hand
hanging
down
her
side
holding
a
white
*NL*
handkerchief
and
a
reticule
,
and
underneath
the
picture
it
said
``
Shall
*NL*
I
Never
See
Thee
More
Alas
.
''
Another
one
was
a
young
lady
with
her
*NL*
hair
all
combed
up
straight
to
the
top
of
her
head
,
and
knotted
there
*NL*
in
front
of
a
comb
like
a
chair-back
,
and
she
was
crying
into
a
*NL*
handkerchief
and
had
a
dead
bird
laying
on
its
back
in
her
other
hand
*NL*
with
its
heels
up
,
and
underneath
the
picture
it
said
``
I
Shall
Never
*NL*
Hear
Thy
Sweet
Chirrup
More
Alas
.
''
There
was
one
where
a
young
lady
*NL*
was
at
a
window
looking
up
at
the
moon
,
and
tears
running
down
her
*NL*
cheeks
;
and
she
had
an
open
letter
in
one
hand
with
black
sealing-wax
*NL*
showing
on
one
edge
of
it
,
and
she
was
mashing
a
locket
with
a
chain
*NL*
to
it
against
her
mouth
,
and
underneath
the
picture
it
said
``
And
Art
*NL*
Thou
Gone
Yes
Thou
Art
Gone
Alas
.
''
These
was
all
nice
pictures
,
I
*NL*
reckon
,
but
I
did
n't
somehow
seem
to
take
to
them
,
because
if
ever
I
*NL*
was
down
a
little
they
always
give
me
the
fan-tods
.
Everybody
was
*NL*
sorry
she
died
,
because
she
had
laid
out
a
lot
more
of
these
pictures
*NL*
to
do
,
and
a
body
could
see
by
what
she
had
done
what
they
had
lost
.
*NL*
But
I
reckoned
that
with
her
disposition
she
was
having
a
better
time
*NL*
in
the
graveyard
.
She
was
at
work
on
what
they
said
was
her
greatest
*NL*
picture
when
she
took
sick
,
and
every
day
and
every
night
it
was
her
*NL*
prayer
to
be
allowed
to
live
till
she
got
it
done
,
but
she
never
got
*NL*
the
chance
.
It
was
a
picture
of
a
young
woman
in
a
long
white
gown
,
*NL*
standing
on
the
rail
of
a
bridge
all
ready
to
jump
off
,
with
her
hair
*NL*
all
down
her
back
,
and
looking
up
to
the
moon
,
with
the
tears
running
*NL*
down
her
face
,
and
she
had
two
arms
folded
across
her
breast
,
and
two
*NL*
arms
stretched
out
in
front
,
and
two
more
reaching
up
toward
the
*NL*
moon
--
and
the
idea
was
to
see
which
pair
would
look
best
,
and
then
*NL*
scratch
out
all
the
other
arms
;
but
,
as
I
was
saying
,
she
died
before
*NL*
she
got
her
mind
made
up
,
and
now
they
kept
this
picture
over
the
head
*NL*
of
the
bed
in
her
room
,
and
every
time
her
birthday
come
they
hung
*NL*
flowers
on
it
.
Other
times
it
was
hid
with
a
little
curtain
.
The
young
*NL*
woman
in
the
picture
had
a
kind
of
a
nice
sweet
face
,
but
there
was
so
*NL*
many
arms
it
made
her
look
too
spidery
,
seemed
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
young
girl
kept
a
scrap-book
when
she
was
alive
,
and
used
to
*NL*
paste
obituaries
and
accidents
and
cases
of
patient
suffering
in
it
*NL*
out
of
the
Presbyterian
Observer
,
and
write
poetry
after
them
out
of
*NL*
her
own
head
.
It
was
very
good
poetry
.
This
is
what
she
wrote
about
a
*NL*
boy
by
the
name
of
Stephen
Dowling
Bots
that
fell
down
a
well
and
was
*NL*
drownded
:
*NL*
*NL*
ODE
TO
STEPHEN
DOWLING
BOTS
,
DEC
'D
*NL*
*NL*
And
did
young
Stephen
sicken
,
*NL*
And
did
young
Stephen
die
?
*NL*
And
did
the
sad
hearts
thicken
,
*NL*
And
did
the
mourners
cry
?
*NL*
*NL*
No
;
such
was
not
the
fate
of
*NL*
Young
Stephen
Dowling
Bots
;
*NL*
Though
sad
hearts
round
him
thickened
,
*NL*
'T
was
not
from
sickness
'
shots
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
whooping-cough
did
rack
his
frame
,
*NL*
Nor
measles
drear
with
spots
;
*NL*
Not
these
impaired
the
sacred
name
*NL*
Of
Stephen
Dowling
Bots
.
*NL*
*NL*
Despised
love
struck
not
with
woe
*NL*
That
head
of
curly
knots
,
*NL*
Nor
stomach
troubles
laid
him
low
,
*NL*
Young
Stephen
Dowling
Bots
.
*NL*
*NL*
O
no
.
Then
list
with
tearful
eye
,
*NL*
Whilst
I
his
fate
do
tell
.
*NL*
His
soul
did
from
this
cold
world
fly
*NL*
By
falling
down
a
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
got
him
out
and
emptied
him
;
*NL*
Alas
it
was
too
late
;
*NL*
His
spirit
was
gone
for
to
sport
aloft
*NL*
In
the
realms
of
the
good
and
great
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
Emmeline
Grangerford
could
make
poetry
like
that
before
she
was
*NL*
fourteen
,
there
ai
n't
no
telling
what
she
could
`
a
'
done
by
and
by
.
*NL*
Buck
said
she
could
rattle
off
poetry
like
nothing
.
She
did
n't
ever
*NL*
have
to
stop
to
think
.
He
said
she
would
slap
down
a
line
,
and
if
she
*NL*
could
n't
find
anything
to
rhyme
with
it
would
just
scratch
it
out
and
*NL*
slap
down
another
one
,
and
go
ahead
.
She
war
n't
particular
;
she
could
*NL*
write
about
anything
you
choose
to
give
her
to
write
about
just
so
it
*NL*
was
sadful
.
Every
time
a
man
died
,
or
a
woman
died
,
or
a
child
died
,
*NL*
she
would
be
on
hand
with
her
``
tribute
''
before
he
was
cold
.
She
called
*NL*
them
tributes
.
The
neighbors
said
it
was
the
doctor
first
,
then
*NL*
Emmeline
,
then
the
undertaker
--
the
undertaker
never
got
in
ahead
of
*NL*
Emmeline
but
once
,
and
then
she
hung
fire
on
a
rhyme
for
the
dead
*NL*
person
's
name
,
which
was
Whistler
.
She
war
n't
ever
the
same
after
*NL*
that
;
she
never
complained
,
but
she
kinder
pined
away
and
did
not
live
*NL*
long
.
Poor
thing
,
many
's
the
time
I
made
myself
go
up
to
the
little
*NL*
room
that
used
to
be
hers
and
get
out
her
poor
old
scrap-book
and
read
*NL*
in
it
when
her
pictures
had
been
aggravating
me
and
I
had
soured
on
*NL*
her
a
little
.
I
liked
all
that
family
,
dead
ones
and
all
,
and
war
n't
*NL*
going
to
let
anything
come
between
us
.
Poor
Emmeline
made
poetry
about
*NL*
all
the
dead
people
when
she
was
alive
,
and
it
did
n't
seem
right
that
*NL*
there
war
n't
nobody
to
make
some
about
her
now
she
was
gone
;
so
I
*NL*
tried
to
sweat
out
a
verse
or
two
myself
,
but
I
could
n't
seem
to
make
*NL*
it
go
somehow
.
They
kept
Emmeline
's
room
trim
and
nice
,
and
all
the
*NL*
things
fixed
in
it
just
the
way
she
liked
to
have
them
when
she
was
*NL*
alive
,
and
nobody
ever
slept
there
.
The
old
lady
took
care
of
the
room
*NL*
herself
,
though
there
was
plenty
of
niggers
,
and
she
sewed
there
a
*NL*
good
deal
and
read
her
Bible
there
mostly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
as
I
was
saying
about
the
parlor
,
there
was
beautiful
curtains
*NL*
on
the
windows
:
white
,
with
pictures
painted
on
them
of
castles
with
*NL*
vines
all
down
the
walls
,
and
cattle
coming
down
to
drink
.
There
was
a
*NL*
little
old
piano
,
too
,
that
had
tin
pans
in
it
,
I
reckon
,
and
nothing
*NL*
was
ever
so
lovely
as
to
hear
the
young
ladies
sing
``
The
Last
Link
is
*NL*
Broken
''
and
play
``
The
Battle
of
Prague
''
on
it
.
The
walls
of
all
the
*NL*
rooms
was
plastered
,
and
most
had
carpets
on
the
floors
,
and
the
whole
*NL*
house
was
whitewashed
on
the
outside
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
double
house
,
and
the
big
open
place
betwixt
them
was
roofed
*NL*
and
floored
,
and
sometimes
the
table
was
set
there
in
the
middle
of
*NL*
the
day
,
and
it
was
a
cool
,
comfortable
place
.
Nothing
could
n't
be
*NL*
better
.
And
war
n't
the
cooking
good
,
and
just
bushels
of
it
too
!

CHAPTER
XVIII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Col.
Grangerford
was
a
gentleman
,
you
see
.
He
was
a
gentleman
all
*NL*
over
;
and
so
was
his
family
.
He
was
well
born
,
as
the
saying
is
,
and
*NL*
that
's
worth
as
much
in
a
man
as
it
is
in
a
horse
,
so
the
Widow
*NL*
Douglas
said
,
and
nobody
ever
denied
that
she
was
of
the
first
*NL*
aristocracy
in
our
town
;
and
pap
he
always
said
it
,
too
,
though
he
*NL*
war
n't
no
more
quality
than
a
mudcat
himself
.
Col.
Grangerford
was
*NL*
very
tall
and
very
slim
,
and
had
a
darkish-paly
complexion
,
not
a
sign
*NL*
of
red
in
it
anywheres
;
he
was
clean-shaved
every
morning
all
over
his
*NL*
thin
face
,
and
he
had
the
thinnest
kind
of
lips
,
and
the
thinnest
kind
*NL*
of
nostrils
,
and
a
high
nose
,
and
heavy
eyebrows
,
and
the
blackest
*NL*
kind
of
eyes
,
sunk
so
deep
back
that
they
seemed
like
they
was
looking
*NL*
out
of
caverns
at
you
,
as
you
may
say
.
His
forehead
was
high
,
and
his
*NL*
hair
was
gray
and
straight
and
hung
to
his
shoulders
.
His
hands
was
*NL*
long
and
thin
,
and
every
day
of
his
life
he
put
on
a
clean
shirt
and
a
*NL*
full
suit
from
head
to
foot
made
out
of
linen
so
white
it
hurt
your
*NL*
eyes
to
look
at
it
;
and
on
Sundays
he
wore
a
blue
tail-coat
with
brass
*NL*
buttons
on
it
.
He
carried
a
mahogany
cane
with
a
silver
head
to
it
.
*NL*
There
war
n't
no
frivolishness
about
him
,
not
a
bit
,
and
he
war
n't
ever
*NL*
loud
.
He
was
as
kind
as
he
could
be
--
you
could
feel
that
,
you
know
,
*NL*
and
so
you
had
confidence
.
Sometimes
he
smiled
,
and
it
was
good
to
*NL*
see
;
but
when
he
straightened
himself
up
like
a
liberty-pole
,
and
the
*NL*
lightning
begun
to
flicker
out
from
under
his
eyebrows
,
you
wanted
to
*NL*
climb
a
tree
first
,
and
find
out
what
the
matter
was
afterwards
.
He
*NL*
did
n't
ever
have
to
tell
anybody
to
mind
their
manners
--
everybody
was
*NL*
always
good-mannered
where
he
was
.
Everybody
loved
to
have
him
around
,
*NL*
too
;
he
was
sunshine
most
always
--
I
mean
he
made
it
seem
like
good
*NL*
weather
.
When
he
turned
into
a
cloud-bank
it
was
awful
dark
for
half
a
*NL*
minute
,
and
that
was
enough
;
there
would
n't
nothing
go
wrong
again
for
*NL*
a
week
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
him
and
the
old
lady
come
down
in
the
morning
all
the
family
got
*NL*
up
out
of
their
chairs
and
give
them
good
day
,
and
did
n't
set
down
*NL*
again
till
they
had
set
down
.
Then
Tom
and
Bob
went
to
the
sideboard
*NL*
where
the
decanter
was
,
and
mixed
a
glass
of
bitters
and
handed
it
to
*NL*
him
,
and
he
held
it
in
his
hand
and
waited
till
Tom
's
and
Bob
's
was
*NL*
mixed
,
and
then
they
bowed
and
said
,
``
Our
duty
to
you
,
sir
,
and
*NL*
madam
''
;
and
_
they
_
bowed
the
least
bit
in
the
world
and
said
thank
*NL*
you
,
and
so
they
drank
,
all
three
,
and
Bob
and
Tom
poured
a
spoonful
*NL*
of
water
on
the
sugar
and
the
mite
of
whisky
or
apple-brandy
in
the
*NL*
bottom
of
their
tumblers
,
and
give
it
to
me
and
Buck
,
and
we
drank
to
*NL*
the
old
people
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bob
was
the
oldest
and
Tom
next
--
tall
,
beautiful
men
with
very
broad
*NL*
shoulders
and
brown
faces
,
and
long
black
hair
and
black
eyes
.
They
*NL*
dressed
in
white
linen
from
head
to
foot
,
like
the
old
gentleman
,
and
*NL*
wore
broad
Panama
hats
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
there
was
Miss
Charlotte
;
she
was
twenty-five
,
and
tall
and
proud
*NL*
and
grand
,
but
as
good
as
she
could
be
when
she
war
n't
stirred
up
;
but
*NL*
when
she
was
she
had
a
look
that
would
make
you
wilt
in
your
tracks
,
*NL*
like
her
father
.
She
was
beautiful
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
was
her
sister
,
Miss
Sophia
,
but
it
was
a
different
kind
.
She
was
*NL*
gentle
and
sweet
like
a
dove
,
and
she
was
only
twenty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Each
person
had
their
own
nigger
to
wait
on
them
--
Buck
too
.
My
nigger
*NL*
had
a
monstrous
easy
time
,
because
I
war
n't
used
to
having
anybody
do
*NL*
anything
for
me
,
but
Buck
's
was
on
the
jump
most
of
the
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
all
there
was
of
the
family
now
,
but
there
used
to
be
*NL*
more
--
three
sons
;
they
got
killed
;
and
Emmeline
that
died
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
gentleman
owned
a
lot
of
farms
and
over
a
hundred
niggers
.
*NL*
Sometimes
a
stack
of
people
would
come
there
,
horseback
,
from
ten
or
*NL*
fifteen
mile
around
,
and
stay
five
or
six
days
,
and
have
such
*NL*
junketings
round
about
and
on
the
river
,
and
dances
and
picnics
in
the
*NL*
woods
daytimes
,
and
balls
at
the
house
nights
.
These
people
was
mostly
*NL*
kinfolks
of
the
family
.
The
men
brought
their
guns
with
them
.
It
was
a
*NL*
handsome
lot
of
quality
,
I
tell
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
another
clan
of
aristocracy
around
there
--
five
or
six
*NL*
families
--
mostly
of
the
name
of
Shepherdson
.
They
was
as
high-toned
*NL*
and
well
born
and
rich
and
grand
as
the
tribe
of
Grangerfords
.
The
*NL*
Shepherdsons
and
Grangerfords
used
the
same
steamboat-landing
,
which
*NL*
was
about
two
mile
above
our
house
;
so
sometimes
when
I
went
up
there
*NL*
with
a
lot
of
our
folks
I
used
to
see
a
lot
of
the
Shepherdsons
there
*NL*
on
their
fine
horses
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
Buck
and
me
was
away
out
in
the
woods
hunting
,
and
heard
a
*NL*
horse
coming
.
We
was
crossing
the
road
.
Buck
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quick
!
Jump
for
the
woods
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
done
it
,
and
then
peeped
down
the
woods
through
the
leaves
.
Pretty
*NL*
soon
a
splendid
young
man
came
galloping
down
the
road
,
setting
his
*NL*
horse
easy
and
looking
like
a
soldier
.
He
had
his
gun
across
his
*NL*
pommel
.
I
had
seen
him
before
.
It
was
young
Harney
Shepherdson
.
I
*NL*
heard
Buck
's
gun
go
off
at
my
ear
,
and
Harney
's
hat
tumbled
off
from
*NL*
his
head
.
He
grabbed
his
gun
and
rode
straight
to
the
place
where
we
*NL*
was
hid
.
But
we
did
n't
wait
.
We
started
through
the
woods
on
a
run
.
*NL*
The
woods
war
n't
thick
,
so
I
looked
over
my
shoulder
to
dodge
the
*NL*
bullet
,
and
twice
I
seen
Harney
cover
Buck
with
his
gun
;
and
then
he
*NL*
rode
away
the
way
he
come
--
to
get
his
hat
,
I
reckon
,
but
I
could
n't
*NL*
see
.
We
never
stopped
running
till
we
got
home
.
The
old
gentleman
's
*NL*
eyes
blazed
a
minute
--
't
was
pleasure
,
mainly
,
I
judged
--
then
his
face
*NL*
sort
of
smoothed
down
,
and
he
says
,
kind
of
gentle
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
like
that
shooting
from
behind
a
bush
.
Why
did
n't
you
step
*NL*
into
the
road
,
my
boy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Shepherdsons
do
n't
,
father
.
They
always
take
advantage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Charlotte
she
held
her
head
up
like
a
queen
while
Buck
was
*NL*
telling
his
tale
,
and
her
nostrils
spread
and
her
eyes
snapped
.
The
*NL*
two
young
men
looked
dark
,
but
never
said
nothing
.
Miss
Sophia
she
*NL*
turned
pale
,
but
the
color
come
back
when
she
found
the
man
war
n't
*NL*
hurt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
as
I
could
get
Buck
down
by
the
corn-cribs
under
the
trees
by
*NL*
ourselves
,
I
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
want
to
kill
him
,
Buck
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
bet
I
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
he
do
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Him
?
He
never
done
nothing
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
what
did
you
want
to
kill
him
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
nothing
--
only
it
's
on
account
of
the
feud
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
a
feud
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
where
was
you
raised
?
Do
n't
you
know
what
a
feud
is
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
heard
of
it
before
--
tell
me
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
says
Buck
,
``
a
feud
is
this
way
:
A
man
has
a
quarrel
with
*NL*
another
man
,
and
kills
him
;
then
that
other
man
's
brother
kills
_
him
_
;
*NL*
then
the
other
brothers
,
on
both
sides
,
goes
for
one
another
;
then
the
*NL*
_
cousins
_
chip
in
--
and
by
and
by
everybody
's
killed
off
,
and
there
*NL*
ai
n't
no
more
feud

But
it
's
kind
of
slow
,
and
takes
a
long
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
this
one
been
going
on
long
,
Buck
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
should
_
reckon
!
_
It
started
thirty
year
ago
,
or
som
`
ers
along
*NL*
there
.
There
was
trouble
`
bout
something
,
and
then
a
lawsuit
to
settle
*NL*
it
;
and
the
suit
went
agin
one
of
the
men
,
and
so
he
up
and
shot
the
*NL*
man
that
won
the
suit
--
which
he
would
naturally
do
,
of
course
.
Anybody
*NL*
would
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
was
the
trouble
about

Buck

land
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
reckon
maybe
--
I
do
n't
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
who
done
the
shooting
?
Was
it
a
Grangerford
Shepherdson

*NL*
*NL*

,
how
do
I

It
was
so
long

*NL*
``
Do
n't
anybody
know

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
pa
knows

I
reckon
,
and
some
of
the
other
old
people
;
but
*NL*
they
do
n't
know
now
what
the
row
was
about
in
the
first
place

*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
there
been
many
killed
,
Buck
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
right
smart
chance
of
funerals

But
they
do
n't
always
kill

Pa
's
*NL*
got
a
few
buckshot
in
him
;
but
he
do
n't
mind
it
`
cuz
he
do
n't
weigh
*NL*
much
,
anyway
.
Bob
's
been
carved
up
some
with
a
bowie
,
and
Tom
's
been
*NL*
hurt
once
or
twice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
anybody
been
killed
this
year
,
Buck
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
we
got
one
and
they
got
one
.
`
Bout
three
months
ago
my
cousin
*NL*
Bud
,
fourteen
year
old
,
was
riding
through
the
woods
on
t
`
other
side
*NL*
of
the
river
,
and
did
n't
have
no
weapon
with
him
,
which
was
blame
'
*NL*
foolishness
,
and
in
a
lonesome
place
he
hears
a
horse
a-coming
behind
*NL*
him
,
and
sees
old
Baldy
Shepherdson
a-linkin
'
after
him
with
his
gun
*NL*
in
his
hand
and
his
white
hair
a-flying
in
the
wind
;
and
`
stead
of
*NL*
jumping
off
and
taking
to
the
brush
,
Bud
`
lowed
he
could
outrun
him
;
*NL*
so
they
had
it
,
nip
and
tuck
,
for
five
mile
or
more
,
the
old
man
*NL*
a-gaining
all
the
time
;
so
at
last
Bud
seen
it
war
n't
any
use
,
so
he
*NL*
stopped
and
faced
around
so
as
to
have
the
bullet-holes
in
front
,
you
*NL*
know
,
and
the
old
man
he
rode
up
and
shot
him
down
.
But
he
did
n't
git
*NL*
much
chance
to
enjoy
his
luck
,
for
inside
of
a
week
our
folks
laid
*NL*
_
him
_
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
reckon
that
old
man
was
a
coward
,
Buck
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
reckon
he
_
war
n't
_
a
coward
.
Not
by
a
blame
'
sight
.
There
ai
n't
a
*NL*
coward
amongst
them
Shepherdsons
--
not
a
one
.
And
there
ai
n't
no
*NL*
cowards
amongst
the
Grangerfords
either
.
Why
,
that
old
man
kep
'
up
his
*NL*
end
in
a
fight
one
day
for
half
an
hour
against
three
Grangerfords
,
*NL*
and
come
out
winner
.
They
was
all
a-horseback
;
he
lit
off
of
his
horse
*NL*
and
got
behind
a
little
woodpile
,
and
kep
'
his
horse
before
him
to
*NL*
stop
the
bullets
;
but
the
Grangerfords
stayed
on
their
horses
and
*NL*
capered
around
the
old
man
,
and
peppered
away
at
him
,
and
he
peppered
*NL*
away
at
them
.
Him
and
his
horse
both
went
home
pretty
leaky
and
*NL*
crippled
,
but
the
Grangerfords
had
to
be
_
fetched
_
home
--
and
one
of
*NL*
'em
was
dead
,
and
another
died
the
next
day
.
No
,
sir
;
if
a
body
's
out
*NL*
hunting
for
cowards
he
do
n't
want
to
fool
away
any
time
amongst
them
*NL*
Shepherdsons
,
becuz
they
do
n't
breed
any
of
that
_
kind
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Next
Sunday
we
all
went
to
church
,
about
three
mile
,
everybody
*NL*
a-horseback
.
The
men
took
their
guns
along
,
so
did
Buck
,
and
kept
them
*NL*
between
their
knees
or
stood
them
handy
against
the
wall
.
The
*NL*
Shepherdsons
done
the
same
.
It
was
pretty
ornery
preaching
--
all
about
*NL*
brotherly
love
,
and
such-like
tiresomeness
;
but
everybody
said
it
was
*NL*
a
good
sermon
,
and
they
all
talked
it
over
going
home
,
and
had
such
a
*NL*
powerful
lot
to
say
about
faith
and
good
works
and
free
grace
and
*NL*
preforeordestination
,
and
I
do
n't
know
what
all
,
that
it
did
seem
to
*NL*
me
to
be
one
of
the
roughest
Sundays
I
had
run
across
yet
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
an
hour
after
dinner
everybody
was
dozing
around
,
some
in
their
*NL*
chairs
and
some
in
their
rooms
,
and
it
got
to
be
pretty
dull
.
Buck
and
*NL*
a
dog
was
stretched
out
on
the
grass
in
the
sun
sound
asleep
.
I
went
*NL*
up
to
our
room
,
and
judged
I
would
take
a
nap
myself
.
I
found
that
*NL*
sweet
Miss
Sophia
standing
in
her
door
,
which
was
next
to
ours
,
and
*NL*
she
took
me
in
her
room
and
shut
the
door
very
soft
,
and
asked
me
if
I
*NL*
liked
her
,
and
I
said
I
did
;
and
she
asked
me
if
I
would
do
something
*NL*
for
her
and
not
tell
anybody
,
and
I
said
I
would
.
Then
she
said
she
'd
*NL*
forgot
her
Testament
,
and
left
it
in
the
seat
at
church
between
two
*NL*
other
books
,
and
would
I
slip
out
quiet
and
go
there
and
fetch
it
to
*NL*
her
,
and
not
say
nothing
to
nobody
.
I
said
I
would
.
So
I
slid
out
and
*NL*
slipped
off
up
the
road
,
and
there
war
n't
anybody
at
the
church
,
*NL*
except
maybe
a
hog
or
two
,
for
there
war
n't
any
lock
on
the
door
,
and
*NL*
hogs
likes
a
puncheon
floor
in
summer-time
because
it
's
cool
.
If
you
*NL*
notice
,
most
folks
do
n't
go
to
church
only
when
they
've
got
to
;
but
a
*NL*
hog
is
different
.
*NL*
*NL*
Says
I
to
myself
,
something
's
up
;
it
ai
n't
natural
for
a
girl
to
be
in
*NL*
such
a
sweat
about
a
Testament
.
So
I
give
it
a
shake
,
and
out
drops
a
*NL*
little
piece
of
paper
with
''
_
Half
past
two
_
''
wrote
on
it
with
a
*NL*
pencil
.
I
ransacked
it
,
but
could
n't
find
anything
else
.
I
could
n't
*NL*
make
anything
out
of
that
,
so
I
put
the
paper
in
the
book
again
,
and
*NL*
when
I
got
home
and
upstairs
there
was
Miss
Sophia
in
her
door
waiting
*NL*
for
me
.
She
pulled
me
in
and
shut
the
door
;
then
she
looked
in
the
*NL*
Testament
till
she
found
the
paper
,
and
as
soon
as
she
read
it
she
*NL*
looked
glad
;
and
before
a
body
could
think
she
grabbed
me
and
give
me
*NL*
a
squeeze
,
and
said
I
was
the
best
boy
in
the
world
,
and
not
to
tell
*NL*
anybody
.
She
was
mighty
red
in
the
face
for
a
minute
,
and
her
eyes
*NL*
lighted
up
,
and
it
made
her
powerful
pretty
.
I
was
a
good
deal
*NL*
astonished
,
but
when
I
got
my
breath
I
asked
her
what
the
paper
was
*NL*
about
,
and
she
asked
me
if
I
had
read
it
,
and
I
said
no
,
and
she
asked
*NL*
me
if
I
could
read
writing
,
and
I
told
her
``
no
,
only
coarse-hand
,
''
and
*NL*
then
she
said
the
paper
war
n't
anything
but
a
book-mark
to
keep
her
*NL*
place
,
and
I
might
go
and
play
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
off
down
to
the
river
,
studying
over
this
thing
,
and
pretty
*NL*
soon
I
noticed
that
my
nigger
was
following
along
behind
.
When
we
was
*NL*
out
of
sight
of
the
house
he
looked
back
and
around
a
second
,
and
then
*NL*
comes
a-running
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mars
Jawge
,
if
you
'll
come
down
into
de
swamp
I
'll
show
you
a
whole
*NL*
stack
o
'
water-moccasins
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thinks
I
,
that
's
mighty
curious
;
he
said
that
yesterday
.
He
oughter
*NL*
know
a
body
do
n't
love
water-moccasins
enough
to
go
around
hunting
for
*NL*
them
.
What
is
he
up
to
,
anyway
?
So
I
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
;
trot
ahead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
followed
a
half
a
mile
;
then
he
struck
out
over
the
swamp
,
and
waded
*NL*
ankle-deep
as
much
as
another
half-mile
.
We
come
to
a
little
flat
*NL*
piece
of
land
which
was
dry
and
very
thick
with
trees
and
bushes
and
*NL*
vines
,
and
he
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
shove
right
in
dah
jist
a
few
steps
,
Mars
Jawge
;
dah
's
whah
dey
*NL*
is
.
I
's
seed
'm
befo
'
;
I
do
n't
k
`
yer
to
see
'em
no
mo
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
slopped
right
along
and
went
away
,
and
pretty
soon
the
trees
*NL*
hid
him
.
I
poked
into
the
place
a-ways
and
come
to
a
little
open
patch
*NL*
as
big
as
a
bedroom
all
hung
around
with
vines
,
and
found
a
man
laying
*NL*
there
asleep
--
and
,
by
jings
,
it
was
my
old
Jim
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
waked
him
up
,
and
I
reckoned
it
was
going
to
be
a
grand
surprise
to
*NL*
him
to
see
me
again
,
but
it
war
n't
.
He
nearly
cried
he
was
so
glad
,
*NL*
but
he
war
n't
surprised
.
Said
he
swum
along
behind
me
that
night
,
and
*NL*
heard
me
yell
every
time
,
but
das
n't
answer
,
because
he
did
n't
want
*NL*
nobody
to
pick
_
him
_
up
and
take
him
into
slavery
again
.
Says
he
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
got
hurt
a
little
,
en
could
n't
swim
fas
'
,
so
I
wuz
a
considerable

when

reck

`

to

,
but
when
I
*NL*
see

I
begin
to
go
slow

I
`
uz
off
too
fur
to

waked
up

was

goes

everything

still

Just

Down

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
up
the
river
road
as
hard
as
I
could
put
.
By
and
by
I
begin
to
*NL*
hear
guns
a
good
ways
off
.
When
I
came
in
sight
of
the
log
store
and
*NL*
the
woodpile
where
the
steamboats
lands
I
worked
along
under
the
trees
*NL*
and
brush
till
I
got
to
a
good
place
,
and
then
I
clumb
up
into
the
*NL*
forks
of
a
cottonwood
that
was
out
of
reach
,
and
watched
.
There
was
a
*NL*
wood-rank
four
foot
high
a
little
ways
in
front
of
the
tree
,
and
first
*NL*
I
was
going
to
hide
behind
that
;
but
maybe
it
was
luckier
I
did
n't
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
four
or
five
men
cavorting
around
on
their
horses
in
the
*NL*
open
place
before
the
log
store
,
cussing
and
yelling
,
and
trying
to
*NL*
get
at
a
couple
of
young
chaps
that
was
behind
the
wood-rank
alongside
*NL*
of
the
steamboat-landing
;
but
they
could
n't
come
it
.
Every
time
one
of
*NL*
them
showed
himself
on
the
river
side
of
the
woodpile
he
got
shot
at
.
*NL*
The
two
boys
was
squatting
back
to
back
behind
the
pile
,
so
they
could
*NL*
watch
both
ways
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
and
by
the
men
stopped
cavorting
around
and
yelling
.
They
started
*NL*
riding
towards
the
store
;
then
up
gets
one
of
the
boys
,
draws
a
steady
*NL*
bead
over
the
wood-rank
,
and
drops
one
of
them
out
of
his
saddle
.
All
*NL*
the
men
jumped
off
of
their
horses
and
grabbed
the
hurt
one
and
*NL*
started
to
carry
him
to
the
store
;
and
that
minute
the
two
boys
*NL*
started
on
the
run
.
They
got
half-way
to
the
tree
I
was
in
before
the
*NL*
men
noticed
.
Then
the
men
see
them
,
and
jumped
on
their
horses
and
*NL*
took
out
after
them
.
They
gained
on
the
boys
,
but
it
did
n't
do
no
*NL*
good
,
the
boys
had
too
good
a
start
;
they
got
to
the
woodpile
that
was
*NL*
in
front
of
my
tree
,
and
slipped
in
behind
it
,
and
so
they
had
the
*NL*
bulge
on
the
men
again
.
One
of
the
boys
was
Buck
,
and
the
other
was
a
*NL*
slim
young
chap
about
nineteen
years
old
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
men
ripped
around
awhile
,
and
then
rode
away
.
As
soon
as
they
was
*NL*
out
of
sight
I
sung
out
to
Buck
and
told
him
.
He
did
n't
know
what
to
*NL*
make
of
my
voice
coming
out
of
the
tree
at
first
.
He
was
awful
*NL*
surprised
.
He
told
me
to
watch
out
sharp
and
let
him
know
when
the
men
*NL*
come
in
sight
again
;
said
they
was
up
to
some
devilment
or
*NL*
other
--
would
n't
be
gone
long
.
I
wished
I
was
out
of
that
tree
,
but
I
*NL*
das
n't
come
down
.
Buck
begun
to
cry
and
rip
,
and
`
lowed
that
him
and
*NL*
his
cousin
Joe
-LRB-
that
was
the
other
young
chap
-RRB-
would
make
up
for
this
*NL*
day
yet
.
He
said
his
father
and
his
two
brothers
was
killed
,
and
two
*NL*
or
three
of
the
enemy
.
Said
the
Shepherdsons
laid
for
them
in
ambush
.
*NL*
Buck
said
his
father
and
brothers
ought
to
waited
for
their
*NL*
relations
--
the
Shepherdsons
was
too
strong
for
them
.
I
asked
him
what
*NL*
was
become
of
young
Harney
and
Miss
Sophia
.
He
said
they
'd
got
across
*NL*
the
river
and
was
safe
.
I
was
glad
of
that
;
but
the
way
Buck
did
take
*NL*
on
because
he
did
n't
manage
to
kill
Harney
that
day
he
shot
at
him
--
I
*NL*
hai
n't
ever
heard
anything
like
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
of
a
sudden
,
bang
!
bang
!
bang
!
goes
three
or
four
guns
--
the
men
*NL*
had
slipped
around
through
the
woods
and
come
in
from
behind
without
*NL*
their
horses
!
The
boys
jumped
for
the
river
--
both
of
them
hurt
--
and
as
*NL*
they
swum
down
the
current
the
men
run
along
the
bank
shooting
at
them
*NL*
and
singing
out
,
``
Kill
them
,
kill
them
!
''
It
made
me
so
sick
I
most
*NL*
fell
out
of
the
tree
.
I
ai
n't
a-going
to
tell
_
all
_
that
happened
--
it
*NL*
would
make
me
sick
again
if
I
was
to
do
that
.
I
wished
I
had
n't
ever
*NL*
come
ashore
that
night
to
see
such
things
.
I
ai
n't
ever
going
to
get
*NL*
shut
of
them
--
lots
of
times
I
dream
about
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
stayed
in
the
tree
till
it
begun
to
get
dark
,
afraid
to
come
down
.
*NL*
Sometimes
I
heard
guns
away
off
in
the
woods
;
and
twice
I
seen
little
*NL*
gangs
of
men
gallop
past
the
log
store
with
guns
;
so
I
reckoned
the
*NL*
trouble
was
still
a-going
on
.
I
was
mighty
downhearted
;
so
I
made
up
*NL*
my
mind
I
would
n't
ever
go
anear
that
house
again
,
because
I
reckoned
*NL*
I
was
to
blame
,
somehow
.
I
judged
that
that
piece
of
paper
meant
that
*NL*
Miss
Sophia
was
to
meet
Harney
somewheres
at
half
past
two
and
run
*NL*
off
;
and
I
judged
I
ought
to
told
her
father
about
that
paper
and
the
*NL*
curious
way
she
acted
,
and
then
maybe
he
would
`
a
'
locked
her
up
,
and
*NL*
this
awful
mess
would
n't
ever
happened
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
got
down
out
of
the
tree
I
crept
along
down
the
river-bank
a
*NL*
piece
,
and
found
the
two
bodies
laying
in
the
edge
of
the
water
,
and
*NL*
tugged
at
them
till
I
got
them
ashore
;
then
I
covered
up
their
faces
,
*NL*
and
got
away
as
quick
as
I
could
.
I
cried
a
little
when
I
was
covering
*NL*
up
Buck
's
face
,
for
he
was
mighty
good
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
just
dark
now
.
I
never
went
near
the
house
,
but
struck
through
*NL*
the
woods
and
made
for
the
swamp
.
Jim
war
n't
on
his
island
,
so
I
*NL*
tramped
off
in
a
hurry
for
the
crick
,
and
crowded
through
the
willows
,
*NL*
red-hot
to
jump
aboard
and
get
out
of
that
awful
country
.
The
raft
was
*NL*
gone
!
My
souls
,
but
I
was
scared
!
I
could
n't
get
my
breath
for
most
a
*NL*
minute
.
Then
I
raised
a
yell
.
A
voice
not
twenty-five
foot
from
me
*NL*
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
lan
'
!
is
dat
you
,
honey
?
Doan
'
make
no
noise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Jim
's
voice
--
nothing
ever
sounded
so
good
before
.
I
run
along
*NL*
the
bank
a
piece
and
got
aboard
,
and
Jim
he
grabbed
me
and
hugged
me
,
*NL*
he
was
so
glad
to
see
me
.
He
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Laws

*NL*
I
've
been
killed
,
and
floated
down
the
river
--
there
's
something
up
*NL*
there
that
'll
help
them
think
so
--
so
do
n't
you
lose
no
time
,
Jim
,
but
*NL*
just
shove
off
for
the
big
water
as
fast
as
ever
you
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
never
felt
easy
till
the
raft
was
two
mile
below
there
and
out
in
*NL*
the
middle
of
the
Mississippi
.
Then
we
hung
up
our
signal
lantern
,
and
*NL*
judged
that
we
was
free
and
safe
once
more
.
I
had
n't
had
a
bite
to
eat
*NL*
since
yesterday
,
so
Jim
he
got
out
some
corn-dodgers
and
buttermilk
,
*NL*
and
pork
and
cabbage
and
greens
--
there
ai
n't
nothing
in
the
world
so
*NL*
good
when
it
's
cooked
right
--
and
whilst
I
eat
my
supper
we
talked
and
*NL*
had
a
good
time
.
I
was
powerful
glad
to
get
away
from
the
feuds
,
and
*NL*
so
was
Jim
to
get
away
from
the
swamp
.
We
said
there
war
n't
no
home
*NL*
like
a
raft
,
after
all
.
Other
places
do
seem
so
cramped
up
and
*NL*
smothery
,
but
a
raft
do
n't
.
You
feel
mighty
free
and
easy
and
*NL*
comfortable
on
a
raft
.

CHAPTER
XIX
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Two
or
three
days
and
nights
went
by
;
I
reckon
I
might
say
they
swum
*NL*
by
,
they
slid
along
so
quiet
and
smooth
and
lovely
.
Here
is
the
way
we
*NL*
put
in
the
time
.
It
was
a
monstrous
big
river
down
there
--
sometimes
a
*NL*
mile
and
a
half
wide
;
we
run
nights
,
and
laid
up
and
hid
daytimes
;
*NL*
soon
as
night
was
most
gone
we
stopped
navigating
and
tied
up
--
nearly
*NL*
always
in
the
dead
water
under
a
towhead
;
and
then
cut
young
*NL*
cottonwoods
and
willows
,
and
hid
the
raft
with
them
.
Then
we
set
out
*NL*
the
lines
.
Next
we
slid
into
the
river
and
had
a
swim
,
so
as
to
*NL*
freshen
up
and
cool
off
;
then
we
set
down
on
the
sandy
bottom
where
*NL*
the
water
was
about
knee-deep
,
and
watched
the
daylight
come
.
Not
a
*NL*
sound
anywheres
--
perfectly
still
--
just
like
the
whole
world
was
*NL*
asleep
,
only
sometimes
the
bullfrogs
a-cluttering
,
maybe
.
The
first
*NL*
thing
to
see
,
looking
away
over
the
water
,
was
a
kind
of
dull
*NL*
line
--
that
was
the
woods
on
t
`
other
side
;
you
could
n't
make
nothing
*NL*
else
out
;
then
a
pale
place
in
the
sky
;
then
more
paleness
spreading
*NL*
around
;
then
the
river
softened
up
away
off
,
and
war
n't
black
any
*NL*
more
,
but
gray
;
you
could
see
little
dark
spots
drifting
along
ever
so
*NL*
far
away
--
trading-scows
,
and
such
things
;
and
long
black
*NL*
streaks
--
rafts
;
sometimes
you
could
hear
a
sweep
screaking
;
or
*NL*
jumbled-up
voices
,
it
was
so
still
,
and
sounds
come
so
far
;
and
by
and
*NL*
by
you
could
see
a
streak
on
the
water
which
you
know
by
the
look
of
*NL*
the
streak
that
there
's
a
snag
there
in
a
swift
current
which
breaks
*NL*
on
it
and
makes
that
streak
look
that
way
;
and
you
see
the
mist
curl
*NL*
up
off
of
the
water
,
and
the
east
reddens
up
,
and
the
river
,
and
you
*NL*
make
out
a
log
cabin
in
the
edge
of
the
woods
,
away
on
the
bank
on
*NL*
t
`
other
side
of
the
river
,
being
a
wood-yard
,
likely
,
and
piled
by
*NL*
them
cheats
so
you
can
throw
a
dog
through
it
anywheres
;
then
the
nice
*NL*
breeze
springs
up
,
and
comes
fanning
you
from
over
there
,
so
cool
and
*NL*
fresh
and
sweet
to
smell
on
account
of
the
woods
and
the
flowers
;
but
*NL*
sometimes
not
that
way
,
because
they
've
left
dead
fish
laying
around
,
*NL*
gars
and
such
,
and
they
do
get
pretty
rank
;
and
next
you
've
got
the
*NL*
full
day
,
and
everything
smiling
in
the
sun
,
and
the
song-birds
just
*NL*
going
it
!
*NL*
*NL*
A
little
smoke
could
n't
be
noticed
now
,
so
we
would
take
some
fish
off
*NL*
of
the
lines
and
cook
up
a
hot
breakfast
.
And
afterwards
we
would
*NL*
watch
the
lonesomeness
of
the
river
,
and
kind
of
lazy
along
,
and
by
*NL*
and
by
lazy
off
to
sleep
.
Wake
up
by
and
by
,
and
look
to
see
what
done
*NL*
it
,
and
maybe
see
a
steamboat
coughing
along
up-stream
,
so
far
off
*NL*
towards
the
other
side
you
could
n't
tell
nothing
about
her
only
*NL*
whether
she
was
a
stern-wheel
or
side-wheel
;
then
for
about
an
hour
*NL*
there
would
n't
be
nothing
to
hear
nor
nothing
to
see
--
just
solid
*NL*
lonesomeness
.
Next
you
'd
see
a
raft
sliding
by
,
away
off
yonder
,
and
*NL*
maybe
a
galoot
on
it
chopping
,
because
they
're
most
always
doing
it
on
*NL*
a
raft
;
you
'd
see
the
ax
flash
and
come
down
--
you
do
n't
hear
nothing
;
*NL*
you
see
that
ax
go
up
again
,
and
by
the
time
it
's
above
the
man
's
head
*NL*
then
you
hear
the
_
k
`
chunk
!
_
--
it
had
took
all
that
time
to
come
over
*NL*
the
water
.
So
we
would
put
in
the
day
,
lazying
around
,
listening
to
*NL*
the
stillness
.
Once
there
was
a
thick
fog
,
and
the
rafts
and
things
*NL*
that
went
by
was
beating
tin
pans
so
the
steamboats
would
n't
run
over
*NL*
them
.
A
scow
or
a
raft
went
by
so
close
we
could
hear
them
talking
and
*NL*
cussing
and
laughing
--
heard
them
plain
;
but
we
could
n't
see
no
sign
of
*NL*
them
;
it
made
you
feel
crawly
;
it
was
like
spirits
carrying
on
that
*NL*
way
in
the
air
.
Jim
said
he
believed
it
was
spirits
;
but
I
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
spirits
would
n't
say
,
`
Dern
the
dern
fog
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
as
it
was
night
out
we
shoved
;
when
we
got
her
out
to
about
the
*NL*
middle
we
let
her
alone
,
and
let
her
float
wherever
the
current
wanted
*NL*
her
to
;
then
we
lit
the
pipes
,
and
dangled
our
legs
in
the
water
,
and
*NL*
talked
about
all
kinds
of
things
--
we
was
always
naked
,
day
and
night
,
*NL*
whenever
the
mosquitoes
would
let
us
--
the
new
clothes
Buck
's
folks
*NL*
made
for
me
was
too
good
to
be
comfortable
,
and
besides
I
did
n't
go
*NL*
much
on
clothes
,
nohow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
we
'd
have
that
whole
river
all
to
ourselves
for
the
longest
*NL*
time
.
Yonder
was
the
banks
and
the
islands
,
across
the
water
;
and
*NL*
maybe
a
spark
--
which
was
a
candle
in
a
cabin
window
;
and
sometimes
on
*NL*
the
water
you
could
see
a
spark
or
two
--
on
a
raft
or
a
scow
,
you
know
;
*NL*
and
maybe
you
could
hear
a
fiddle
or
a
song
coming
over
from
one
of
*NL*
them
crafts
.
It
's
lovely
to
live
on
a
raft
.
We
had
the
sky
up
there
,
*NL*
all
speckled
with
stars
,
and
we
used
to
lay
on
our
backs
and
look
up
*NL*
at
them
,
and
discuss
about
whether
they
was
made
or
only
just
*NL*
happened
.
Jim
he
allowed
they
was
made
,
but
I
allowed
they
happened
;
I
*NL*
judged
it
would
have
took
too
long
to
_
make
_
so
many
.
Jim
said
the
*NL*
moon
could
`
a
'
_
laid
_
them
;
well
,
that
looked
kind
of
reasonable
,
so
I
*NL*
did
n't
say
nothing
against
it
,
because
I
've
seen
a
frog
lay
most
as
*NL*
many
,
so
of
course
it
could
be
done
.
We
used
to
watch
the
stars
that
*NL*
fell
,
too
,
and
see
them
streak
down
.
Jim
allowed
they
'd
got
spoiled
*NL*
and
was
hove
out
of
the
nest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
or
twice
of
a
night
we
would
see
a
steamboat
slipping
along
in
*NL*
the
dark
,
and
now
and
then
she
would
belch
a
whole
world
of
sparks
up
*NL*
out
of
her
chimbleys
,
and
they
would
rain
down
in
the
river
and
look
*NL*
awful
pretty
;
then
she
would
turn
a
corner
and
her
lights
would
wink
*NL*
out
and
her
powwow
shut
off
and
leave
the
river
still
again
;
and
by
*NL*
and
by
her
waves
would
get
to
us
,
a
long
time
after
she
was
gone
,
and
*NL*
joggle
the
raft
a
bit
,
and
after
that
you
would
n't
hear
nothing
for
*NL*
you
could
n't
tell
how
long
,
except
maybe
frogs
or
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
midnight
the
people
on
shore
went
to
bed
,
and
then
for
two
or
*NL*
three
hours
the
shores
was
black
--
no
more
sparks
in
the
cabin
windows
.
*NL*
These
sparks
was
our
clock
--
the
first
one
that
showed
again
meant
*NL*
morning
was
coming
,
so
we
hunted
a
place
to
hide
and
tie
up
right
*NL*
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
about
daybreak
I
found
a
canoe
and
crossed
over
a
chute
to
*NL*
the
main
shore
--
it
was
only
two
hundred
yards
--
and
paddled
about
a
*NL*
mile
up
a
crick
amongst
the
cypress
woods
,
to
see
if
I
could
n't
get
*NL*
some
berries
.
Just
as
I
was
passing
a
place
where
a
kind
of
a
cowpath
*NL*
crossed
the
crick
,
here
comes
a
couple
of
men
tearing
up
the
path
as
*NL*
tight
as
they
could
foot
it
.
I
thought
I
was
a
goner
,
for
whenever
*NL*
anybody
was
after
anybody
I
judged
it
was
_
me
_
--
or
maybe
Jim
.
I
was
*NL*
about
to
dig
out
from
there
in
a
hurry
,
but
they
was
pretty
close
to
*NL*
me
then
,
and
sung
out
and
begged
me
to
save
their
lives
--
said
they
*NL*
had
n't
been
doing
nothing
,
and
was
being
chased
for
it
--
said
there
was
*NL*
men
and
dogs
a-coming
.
They
wanted
to
jump
right
in
,
but
I
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
do
it
.
I
do
n't
hear
the
dogs
and
horses
yet
;
you
've
got
*NL*
time
to
crowd
through
the
brush
and
get
up
the
crick
a
little
ways
;
*NL*
then
you
take
to
the
water
and
wade
down
to
me
and
get
in
--
that
'll
*NL*
throw
the
dogs
off
the
scent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
done
it
,
and
soon
as
they
was
aboard
I
lit
out
for
our
towhead
,
*NL*
and
in
about
five
or
ten
minutes
we
heard
the
dogs
and
the
men
away
*NL*
off
,
shouting
.
We
heard
them
come
along
towards
the
crick
,
but
*NL*
could
n't
see
them
;
they
seemed
to
stop
and
fool
around
awhile
;
then
,
*NL*
as
we
got
further
and
further
away
all
the
time
,
we
could
n't
hardly
*NL*
hear
them
at
all
;
by
the
time
we
had
left
a
mile
of
woods
behind
us
*NL*
and
struck
the
river
,
everything
was
quiet
,
and
we
paddled
over
to
the
*NL*
towhead
and
hid
in
the
cottonwoods
and
was
safe
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
these
fellows
was
about
seventy
or
upwards
,
and
had
a
bald
head
*NL*
and
very
gray
whiskers
.
He
had
an
old
battered-up
slouch
hat
on
,
and
a
*NL*
greasy
blue
woolen
shirt
,
and
ragged
old
blue
jeans
britches
stuffed
*NL*
into
his
boot-tops
,
and
home-knit
galluses
--
no
,
he
only
had
one
.
He
*NL*
had
an
old
long-tailed
blue
jeans
coat
with
slick
brass
buttons
flung
*NL*
over
his
arm
,
and
both
of
them
had
big
,
fat
,
ratty-looking
*NL*
carpet-bags
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
fellow
was
about
thirty
,
and
dressed
about
as
ornery
.
After
*NL*
breakfast
we
all
laid
off
and
talked
,
and
the
first
thing
that
come
*NL*
out
was
that
these
chaps
did
n't
know
one
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
got
you
into
trouble
?
''
says
the
baldhead
to
t
`
other
chap
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'd

an

take

off

generly

I
stayed
about
one
night

Nobody

the

hove
a

*NL*
*NL*
Jim
's
eyes
bugged
out
when

heard
that
;
and
I
reckon
mine
did

too

Then
the
baldhead
says
:
``
No

you
ca
n't
mean

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
My
great-grandfather
,
eldest
son
of
the
Duke
of
Bridgewater
,
*NL*
fled
to
this
country
about
the
end
of
the
last
century
,
to
breathe
the
*NL*
pure
air
of
freedom
;
married
here
,
and
died
,
leaving
a
son
,
his
own
*NL*
father
dying
about
the
same
time
.
The
second
son
of
the
late
duke
*NL*
seized
the
titles
and
estates
--
the
infant
real
duke
was
ignored
.
I
am
*NL*
the
lineal
descendant
of
that
infant
--
I
am
the
rightful
Duke
of
*NL*
Bridgewater
;
and
here
am
I
,
forlorn
,
torn
from
my
high
estate
,
hunted
*NL*
of
men
,
despised
by
the
cold
world
,
ragged
,
worn
,
heartbroken
,
and
*NL*
degraded
to
the
companionship
of
felons
on
a
raft
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jim
pitied
him
ever
so
much
,
and
so
did
I
.
We
tried
to
comfort
him
,
*NL*
but
he
said
it
war
n't
much
use
,
he
could
n't
be
much
comforted
;
said
if
*NL*
we
was
a
mind
to
acknowledge
him
,
that
would
do
him
more
good
than
*NL*
most
anything
else
;
so
we
said
we
would
,
if
he
would
tell
us
how
.
He
*NL*
said
we
ought
to
bow
when
we
spoke
to
him
,
and
say
``
Your
Grace
,
''
or
*NL*
``
My
Lord
,
''
or
``
Your
Lordship
''
--
and
he
would
n't
mind
it
if
we
called
*NL*
him
plain
``
Bridgewater
,
''
which
,
he
said
,
was
a
title
anyway
,
and
not
a
*NL*
name
;
and
one
of
us
ought
to
wait
on
him
at
dinner
,
and
do
any
little
*NL*
thing
for
him
he
wanted
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
that
was
all
easy
,
so
we
done
it
.
All
through
dinner
Jim
stood
*NL*
around
and
waited
on
him
,
and
says
,
``
Will
yo
'
Grace
have
some
o
'
dis
*NL*
or
some
o
'
dat
?
''
and
so
on
,
and
a
body
could
see
it
was
mighty
*NL*
pleasing
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
old
man
got
pretty
silent
by
and
by
--
did
n't
have
much
to
say
,
*NL*
and
did
n't
look
pretty
comfortable
over
all
that
petting
that
was
*NL*
going
on
around
that
duke
.
He
seemed
to
have
something
on
his
mind
.
*NL*
So
,
along
in
the
afternoon
,
he
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Looky
here
,
Bilgewater
,
''
he
says
,
``
I
'm
nation
sorry
for
you
,
but

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
you
ai
n't
the
only
person
that
's
had
a
secret
of
his
birth
.
''
And
,
*NL*
by
jings
,
_
he
_
begins
to
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
!
What
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bilgewater
,
kin
I
trust
you
?
''
says
the
old
man
,
still
sort
of
*NL*
sobbing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
bitter
death
!
''
He
took
the
old
man
by
the
hand
and
squeezed
*NL*
it
,
and
says
,
``
That
secret
of
your
being
:
speak
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bilgewater
,
I
am
the
late
Dauphin
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
You
bet
you
,
Jim
and
me
stared
this
time
.
Then
the
duke
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
friend
,
it
is

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

At

No

You
mean

six
or
seven
hundred
years

the
very
least

*NL*
*NL*
``

premature

in
blue
jeans
and
misery
,

exiled
,
*NL*

and
sufferin
'
rightful
King
of
France
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
he
cried
and
took
on
so
that
me
and
Jim
did
n't
know
hardly
what
*NL*
to
do
,
we
was
so
sorry
--
and
so
glad
and
proud
we
'd
got
him
with
us
,
*NL*
too
.
So
we
set
in
,
like
we
done
before
with
the
duke
,
and
tried
to
*NL*
comfort
_
him
.
_
But
he
said
it
war
n't
no
use
,
nothing
but
to
be
dead
*NL*
and
done
with
it
all
could
do
him
any
good
;
though
he
said
it
often
*NL*
made
him
feel
easier
and
better
for
a
while
if
people
treated
him
*NL*
according
to
his
rights
,
and
got
down
on
one
knee
to
speak
to
him
,
and
*NL*
always
called
him
``
Your
Majesty
,
''
and
waited
on
him
first
at
meals
,
*NL*
and
did
n't
set
down
in
his
presence
till
he
asked
them
.
So
Jim
and
me
*NL*
set
to
majestying
him
,
and
doing
this
and
that
and
t
`
other
for
him
,
*NL*
and
standing
up
till
he
told
us
we
might
set
down
.
This
done
him
heaps
*NL*
of
good
,
and
so
he
got
cheerful
and
comfortable
.
But
the
duke
kind
of
*NL*
soured
on
him
,
and
did
n't
look
a
bit
satisfied
with
the
way
things
was
*NL*
going
;
still
,
the
king
acted
real
friendly
towards
him
,
and
said
the
*NL*
duke
's
great-grandfather
and
all
the
other
Dukes
of
Bilgewater
was
a
*NL*
good
deal
thought
of
by
_
his
_
father
,
and
was
allowed
to
come
to
the
*NL*
palace
considerable
;
but
the
duke
stayed
huffy
a
good
while
,
till
by
*NL*
and
by
the
king
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
as
not
we
got
to
be
together
a
blamed
long
time
on
this
h-yer
*NL*
raft
,
Bilgewater
,
and
so
what
's
the
use
o
'
your
bein
'
sour
?
It
'll
*NL*
only
make
things
oncomfortable
.
It
ai
n't
my
fault
I
war
n't
born
a
*NL*
duke
,
it
ai
n't
your
fault
you
war

born

king

so
what
's
the
use
to
*NL*
worry
?
Make
the
best
o
'
things
the
way
you
find
'em
,
says
I
--
that
's
my
*NL*
motto
.
This
ai
n't
no
bad
thing
that
we
've
struck
here
--
plenty
grub
and
*NL*
an
easy
life
--
come
,
give
us
your
hand
,
duke
,
and
le
's
all
be
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
duke
done
it
,
and
Jim
and
me
was
pretty
glad
to
see
it
.
It
took
*NL*
away
all
the
uncomfortableness
and
we
felt
mighty
good
over
it
,
*NL*
because
it
would
`
a
'
been
a
miserable
business
to
have
any
*NL*
unfriendliness
on
the
raft
;
for
what
you
want
,
above
all
things
,
on
a
*NL*
raft
,
is
for
everybody
to
be
satisfied
,
and
feel
right
and
kind
*NL*
towards
the
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
did
n't
take
me
long
to
make
up
my
mind
that
these
liars
war
n't
no
*NL*
kings
nor
dukes
at
all
,
but
just
low-down
humbugs
and
frauds
.
But
I
*NL*
never
said
nothing
,
never
let
on
;
kept
it
to
myself
;
it
's
the
best
*NL*
way
;
then
you
do
n't
have
no
quarrels
,
and
do
n't
get
into
no
trouble
.
*NL*
If
they
wanted
us
to
call
them
kings
and
dukes
,
I
had
n't
no
*NL*
objections
,
`
long
as
it
would
keep
peace
in
the
family
;
and
it
war
n't
*NL*
no
use
to
tell
Jim
,
so
I
did
n't
tell
him
.
If
I
never
learnt
nothing
*NL*
else
out
of
pap
,
I
learnt
that
the
best
way
to
get
along
with
his
kind
*NL*
of
people
is
to
let
them
have
their
own
way
.

CHAPTER
XX
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
They
asked
us
considerable
many
questions
;
wanted
to
know
what
we
*NL*
covered
up
the
raft
that
way
for
,
and
laid
by
in
the
daytime
instead
*NL*
of
running
--
was
Jim
a
runaway
nigger
?
Says
I
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Goodness
sakes
!
would
a
runaway
nigger
run
_
south
?
_
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
,
they
allowed
he
would
n't
.
I
had
to
account
for
things
some
way
,
so
*NL*
I
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
folks
was
living
in
Pike
County
,
in
Missouri
,
where
I
was
born
,
*NL*
and
they
all
died
off
but
me
and
pa
and
my
brother
Ike
.
Pa
,
he
`
lowed
*NL*
he
'd
break
up
and
go
down
and
live
with
Uncle
Ben
,
who
's
got
a
little
*NL*
one-horse
place
on
the
river
forty-four
mile
below
Orleans
.
Pa
was
*NL*
pretty
poor
,
and
had
some
debts
;
so
when
he
'd
squared
up
there
war
n't
*NL*
nothing
left
but
sixteen
dollars
and
our
nigger
,
Jim
.
That
war
n't
*NL*
enough
to
take
us
fourteen
hundred
mile
,
deck
passage
nor
no
other
*NL*
way
.
Well
,
when
the
river
rose
pa
had
a
streak
of
luck
one
day
;
he
*NL*
ketched
this
piece
of
a
raft
;
so
we
reckoned
we
'd
go
down
to
Orleans
*NL*
on
it
.
Pa
's
luck
did
n't
hold
out
;
a
steamboat
run
over
the
forrard
*NL*
corner
of
the
raft
one
night
,
and
we
all
went
overboard
and
dove
under
*NL*
the
wheel
;
Jim
and
me
come
up
all
right
,
but
pa
was
drunk
,
and
Ike
was
*NL*
only
four
years
old
,
so
they
never
come
up
no
more
.
Well
,
for
the
next
*NL*
day
or
two
we
had
considerable
trouble
,
because
people
was
always
*NL*
coming
out
in
skiffs
and
trying
to
take
Jim
away
from
me
,
saying
they
*NL*
believed
he
was
a
runaway
nigger
.
We
do
n't
run
daytimes
no
more
now
;
*NL*
nights
they
do
n't
bother

The
duke
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
me
alone
to
cipher
out
a
way
so
we
can
run
in
the
daytime
if
we
*NL*
want
to
.
I
'll
think
the
thing
over
--
I
'll
invent
a
plan
that
'll
fix
*NL*
it
.
We
'll
let
it
alone
for
to-day
,
because
of
course
we
do
n't
want
to
*NL*
go
by
that
town
yonder
in
daylight
--
it
might
n't
be
healthy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
night
it
begun
to
darken
up
and
look
like
rain
;
the
*NL*
heat-lightning
was
squirting
around
low
down
in
the
sky
,
and
the
*NL*
leaves
was
beginning
to
shiver
--
it
was
going
to
be
pretty
ugly
,
it
was
*NL*
easy
to
see
that
.
So
the
duke
and
the
king
went
to
overhauling
our
*NL*
wigwam
,
to
see
what
the
beds
was
like
.
My
bed
was
a
straw
tick
--
better
*NL*
than
Jim
's
,
which
was
a
corn-shuck
tick
;
there
's
always
cobs
around
*NL*
about
in
a
shuck
tick
,
and
they
poke
into
you
and
hurt
;
and
when
you
*NL*
roll
over
the
dry
shucks
sound
like
you
was
rolling
over
in
a
pile
of
*NL*
dead
leaves
;
it
makes
such
a
rustling
that
you
wake
up
.
Well
,
the
duke
*NL*
allowed
he
would
take
my
bed
;
but
the
king
allowed
he
would
n't
.
He
*NL*
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
`
a
'
reckoned
the
difference
in
rank
would
a
sejested
to
you
*NL*
that
a
corn-shuck
bed
war
n't
just
fitten
for
me
to
sleep
on
.
Your
*NL*
Grace
'll
take
the
shuck
bed
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jim
and
me
was
in
a
sweat
again
for
a
minute
,
being
afraid
there
was
*NL*
going
to
be
some
more
trouble
amongst
them
;
so
we
was
pretty
glad
when
*NL*
the
duke
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
my
fate
to
be
always
ground
into
the
mire
under
the
iron
heel
of
*NL*
oppression
.
Misfortune
has
broken
my
once
haughty
spirit
;
I
yield
,
I
*NL*
submit
;
't
is
my
fate
.
I
am
alone
in
the
world
--
let
me
suffer
;
I
can
*NL*
bear
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
got
away
as
soon
as
it
was
good
and
dark
.
The
king
told
us
to
stand
*NL*
well
out
towards
the
middle
of
the
river
,
and
not
show
a
light
till
we
*NL*
got
a
long
ways
below
the
town
.
We
come
in
sight
of
the
little
bunch
*NL*
of
lights
by
and
by
--
that
was
the
town
,
you
know
--
and
slid
by
,
about
a
*NL*
half
a
mile
out
,
all
right
.
When
we
was
three-quarters
of
a
mile
below
*NL*
we
hoisted
up
our
signal
lantern
;
and
about
ten
o'clock
it
come
on
to
*NL*
rain
and
blow
and
thunder
and
lighten
like
everything
;
so
the
king
*NL*
told
us
to
both
stay
on
watch
till
the
weather
got
better
;
then
him
*NL*
and
the
duke
crawled
into
the
wigwam
and
turned
in
for
the
night
.
It
*NL*
was
my
watch
below
till
twelve
,
but
I
would
n't
`
a
'
turned
in
anyway
if
*NL*
I
'd
had
a
bed
,
because
a
body
do
n't
see
such
a
storm
as
that
every
day
*NL*
in
the
week
,
not
by
a
long
sight
.
My
souls
,
how
the
wind
did
scream
*NL*
along
!
And
every
second
or
two
there
'd
come
a
glare
that
lit
up
the
*NL*
white-caps
for
a
half
a
mile
around
,
and
you
'd
see
the
islands
looking
*NL*
dusty
through
the
rain
,
and
the
trees
thrashing
around
in
the
wind
;
*NL*
then
comes
a
_
h-whack
!
_
--
bum
!
bum
!
bumble-umble-um-bum-bum-bum-bum
--
and
*NL*
the
thunder
would
go
rumbling
and
grumbling
away
,
and
quit
--
and
then
*NL*
_
rip
_
comes
another
flash
and
another
sock-dolager
.
The
waves
most
*NL*
washed
me
off
the
raft
sometimes
,
but
I
had
n't
any
clothes
on
,
and
*NL*
did
n't
mind
.
We
did
n't
have
no
trouble
about
snags
;
the
lightning
*NL*
was
glaring
and
flittering
around
so
constant
that
we
could
see
them
*NL*
plenty
soon
enough
to
throw
her
head
this
way
or
that
and
miss
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
the
middle
watch
,
you
know
,
but
I
was
pretty
sleepy
by
that
*NL*
time
,
so
Jim
he
said
he
would
stand
the
first
half
of
it
for
me
;
he
*NL*
was
always
mighty
good
that
way
,
Jim
was
.
I
crawled
into
the
wigwam
,
*NL*
but
the
king
and
the
duke
had
their
legs
sprawled
around
so
there
*NL*
war
n't
no
show
for
me
;
so
I
laid
outside
--
I
did
n't
mind
the
rain
,
*NL*
because
it
was
warm
,
and
the
waves
war
n't
running
so
high
now
.
About
*NL*
two
they
come
up
again
,
though
,
and
Jim
was
going
to
call
me
;
but
he
*NL*
changed
his
mind
,
because
he
reckoned
they
war
n't
high
enough
yet
to
*NL*
do
any
harm
;
but
he
was
mistaken
about
that
,
for
pretty
soon
all
of
a
*NL*
sudden
along
comes
a
regular
ripper
and
washed
me
overboard
.
It
most
*NL*
killed
Jim
a-laughing
.
He
was
the
easiest
nigger
to
laugh
that
ever
*NL*
was
,
anyway
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
the
watch
,
and
Jim
he
laid
down
and
snored
away
;
and
by
and
by
*NL*
the
storm
let
up
for
good
and
all
;
and
the
first
cabin-light
that
*NL*
showed
I
rousted
him
out
,
and
we
slid
the
raft
into
hiding-quarters
*NL*
for
the
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
king
got
out
an
old
ratty
deck
of
cards
after
breakfast
,
and
him
*NL*
and
the
duke
played
seven-up
awhile
,
five
cents
a
game
.
Then
they
got
*NL*
tired
of
it
,
and
allowed
they
would
``
lay
out
a
campaign
,
''
as
they
*NL*
called
it
.
The
duke
went
down
into
his
carpet-bag
,
and
fetched
up
a
*NL*
lot
of
little
printed
bills
and
read
them
out
loud
.
One
bill
said
,
*NL*
``
The
celebrated
Dr.
Armand
de
Montalban
,
of
Paris
,
''
would
``
lecture
on
*NL*
the
Science
of
Phrenology
''
at
such
and
such
a
place
,
on
the
blank
day
*NL*
of
blank
,
at
ten
cents
admission
,
and
``
furnish
charts
of
character
at
*NL*
twenty-five
cents
apiece
.
''
The
duke
said
that
was
_
him
.
_
In
another
*NL*
bill
he
was
the
``
world-renowned
Shakespearian
tragedian
,
Garrick
the
*NL*
Younger
,
of
Drury
Lane
,
London
.
''
In
other
bills
he
had
a
lot
of
other
*NL*
names
and
done
other
wonderful
things
,
like
finding
water
and
gold
*NL*
with
a
``
divining-rod
,
''
``
dissipating
witch
spells
,
''
and
so
on
.
By
and
*NL*
by
he
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
histrionic
muse
is
the
darling
.
Have
you
ever
trod
the
*NL*
boards
,
Royalty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
says
the
king
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
shall
,
then
,
before
you
're
three
days
older
,
Fallen
Grandeur
,
''
*NL*
says
the
duke
.
``
The
first
good
town
we
come
to
we
'll
hire
a
hall
and
*NL*
do
the
swordfight
in
`
Richard
III
.
'
and
the
balcony
scene
in
`
Romeo
*NL*
and
Juliet
.
'
How
does
that
strike
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
in
,
up
to
the
hub
,
for
anything
that
will
pay
,
Bilgewater
;
but
,
*NL*
you
see
,
I
do
n't
know
nothing
about
play-actin
'
,
and
hai
n't
ever
seen
*NL*
much
of
it
.
I
was
too
small
when
pap
used
to
have
'em
at
the
palace
.
*NL*
Do
you
reckon
you
can
learn
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Easy

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All

for

fresh

Le

''
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
duke
he
told
him
all
about
who
Romeo
was
and
who
Juliet
was
,
*NL*
and
said
he
was
used
to
being
Romeo
,
so
the
king
could
be
Juliet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
Juliet
's
such
a
young
gal
,
duke
,
my
peeled
head
and
my
white
*NL*
whiskers
is
goin

to
look
oncommon
odd
on
her
,
maybe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
do
n't
you
worry
;
these
country
jakes
wo
n't
ever
think
of
that
.
*NL*
Besides
,
you
know
,
you
'll
be
in
costume
,
and
that
makes
all
the
*NL*
difference
in
the
world
;
Juliet
's
in
a
balcony
,
enjoying
the
moonlight
*NL*
before
she
goes
to
bed
,
and
she
's
got
on
her
nightgown
and
her
ruffled
*NL*
nightcap
.
Here
are
the
costumes
for
the
parts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
got
out
two
or
three
curtain-calico
suits
,
which
he
said
was
*NL*
meedyevil
armor
for
Richard
III
.
and
t
`
other
chap
,
and
a
long
white
*NL*
cotton
nightshirt
and
a
ruffled
nightcap
to
match
.
The
king
was
*NL*
satisfied
;
so
the
duke
got
out
his
book
and
read
the
parts
over
in
the
*NL*
most
splendid
spread-eagle
way
,
prancing
around
and
acting
at
the
same
*NL*
time
,
to
show
how
it
had
got
to
be
done
;
then
he
give
the
book
to
the
*NL*
king
and
told
him
to
get
his
part
by
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
little
one-horse
town
about
three
mile
down
the
bend
,
and
*NL*
after
dinner
the
duke
said
he
had
ciphered
out
his
idea
about
how
to
*NL*
run
in
daylight
without
it
being
dangersome
for
Jim
;
so
he
allowed
he
*NL*
would
go
down
to
the
town
and
fix
that
thing
.
The
king
allowed
he
*NL*
would
go
,
too
,
and
see
if
he
could
n't
strike
something
.
We
was
out
of
*NL*
coffee
,
so
Jim
said
I
better
go
along
with
them
in
the
canoe
and
get
*NL*
some
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
got
there
there
war
n't
nobody
stirring
;
streets
empty
,
and
*NL*
perfectly
dead
and
still
,
like
Sunday
.
We
found
a
sick
nigger
sunning
*NL*
himself
in
a
back
yard
,
and
he
said
everybody
that
war
n't
too
young
or
*NL*
too
sick
or
too
old
was
gone
to
camp-meeting
,
about
two
mile
back
in
*NL*
the
woods
.
The
king
got
the
directions
,
and
allowed
he
'd
go
and
work
*NL*
that
camp-meeting
for
all
it
was
worth
,
and
I
might
go
,
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
duke
said
what
he
was
after
was
a
printing-office
.
We
found
it
;
a
*NL*
little
bit
of
a
concern
,
up
over
a
carpenter-shop
--
carpenters
and
*NL*
printers
all
gone
to
the
meeting
,
and
no
doors
locked
.
It
was
a
dirty
,
*NL*
littered-up
place
,
and
had
ink-marks
,
and
handbills
with
pictures
of
*NL*
horses
and
runaway
niggers
on
them
,
all
over
the
walls
.
The
duke
shed
*NL*
his
coat
and
said
he
was
all
right
now
.
So
me
and
the
king
lit
out
for
*NL*
the
camp-meeting
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
got
there
in
about
a
half
an
hour
fairly
dripping
,
for
it
was
a
*NL*
most
awful
hot
day
.
There
was
as
much
as
a
thousand
people
there
from
*NL*
twenty
mile
around
.
The
woods
was
full
of
teams
and
wagons
,
hitched
*NL*
everywheres
,
feeding
out
of
the
wagon-troughs
and
stomping
to
keep
off
*NL*
the
flies
.
There
was
sheds
made
out
of
poles
and
roofed
over
with
*NL*
branches
,
where
they
had
lemonade
and
gingerbread
to
sell
,
and
piles
*NL*
of
watermelons
and
green
corn
and
such-like
truck
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
preaching
was
going
on
under
the
same
kinds
of
sheds
,
only
they
*NL*
was
bigger
and
held
crowds
of
people
.
The
benches
was
made
out
of
*NL*
outside
slabs
of
logs
,
with
holes
bored
in
the
round
side
to
drive
*NL*
sticks
into
for
legs
.
They
did
n't
have
no
backs
.
The
preachers
had
*NL*
high
platforms
to
stand
on
at
one
end
of
the
sheds
.
The
women
had
on
*NL*
sun-bonnets
;
and
some
had
linsey-woolsey
frocks
,
some
gingham
ones
,
*NL*
and
a
few
of
the
young
ones
had
on
calico
.
Some
of
the
young
men
was
*NL*
barefooted
,
and
some
of
the
children
did
n't
have
on
any
clothes
but
*NL*
just
a
tow-linen
shirt
.
Some
of
the
old
women
was
knitting
,
and
some
*NL*
of
the
young
folks
was
courting
on
the
sly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
shed
we
come
to
the
preacher
was
lining
out
a
hymn
.
He
lined
*NL*
out
two
lines
,
everybody
sung
it
,
and
it
was
kind
of
grand
to
hear
it
,
*NL*
there
was
so
many
of
them
and
they
done
it
in
such
a
rousing
way
;
then
*NL*
he
lined
out
two
more
for
them
to
sing
--
and
so
on
.
The
people
woke
up
*NL*
more
and
more
,
and
sung
louder
and
louder
;
and
towards
the
end
some
*NL*
begun
to
groan
,
and
some
begun
to
shout
.
Then
the
preacher
begun
to
*NL*
preach
,
and
begun
in
earnest
,
too
;
and
went
weaving
first
to
one
side
*NL*
of
the
platform
and
then
the
other
,
and
then
a-leaning
down
over
the
*NL*
front
of
it
,
with
his
arms
and
his
body
going
all
the
time
,
and
*NL*
shouting
his
words
out
with
all
his
might
;
and
every
now
and
then
he
*NL*
would
hold
up
his
Bible
and
spread
it
open
,
and
kind
of
pass
it
around
*NL*
this
way
and
that
,
shouting
,
``
It
's
the
brazen
serpent
in
the
*NL*
wilderness
!
Look
upon
it
and
live
!
''
And
people
would
shout
out
,
*NL*
``
Glory
!
--
A-a
-
_
men
_
!
''
And
so
he
went
on
,
and
the
people
groaning
and
*NL*
crying
and
saying
amen
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
come
to
the
mourners
'
bench
!
come
,
black
with
sin
!
-LRB-
_
amen
!
_
-RRB-
*NL*
come
,
sick
and
sore
!
-LRB-
_
amen
!
_
-RRB-
come
,
lame
and

*NL*
*NL*
And
so
on
.
You
could
n't
make
out
what
the
preacher
said
any
more
,
on
*NL*
account
of
the
shouting
and
crying
.
Folks
got
up
everywheres
in
the
*NL*
crowd
,
and
worked
their
way
just
by
main
strength
to
the
mourners
'
*NL*
bench
,
with
the
tears
running
down
their
faces
;
and
when
all
the
*NL*
mourners
had
got
up
there
to
the
front
benches
in
a
crowd
,
they
sung
*NL*
and
shouted
and
flung
themselves
down
on
the
straw
,
just
crazy
and
*NL*
wild
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
the
first
I
knowed
the
king
got
a-going
,
and
you
could
hear
him
*NL*
over
everybody
;
and
next
he
went
a-charging
up
onto
the
platform
,
and
*NL*
the
preacher
he
begged
him
to
speak
to
the
people
,
and
he
done
it
.
He
*NL*
told
them
he
was
a
pirate
--
been
a
pirate
for
thirty
years
out
in
the
*NL*
Indian
Ocean
--
and
his
crew
was
thinned
out
considerable
last
spring
in
*NL*
a
fight
,
and
he
was
home
now
to
take
out
some
fresh
men
,
and
thanks
to
*NL*
goodness
he
'd
been
robbed
last
night
and
put
ashore
off
of
a
steamboat
*NL*
without
a
cent
,
and
he
was
glad
of
it
;
it
was
the
blessedest
thing
*NL*
that
ever
happened
to
him
,
because
he
was
a
changed
man
now
,
and
happy
*NL*
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
;
and
,
poor
as
he
was
,
he
was
going
to
*NL*
start
right
off
and
work
his
way
back
to
the
Indian
Ocean
,
and
put
in
*NL*
the
rest
of
his
life
trying
to
turn
the
pirates
into
the
true
path
;
*NL*
for
he
could
do
it
better
than
anybody
else
,
being
acquainted
with
all
*NL*
pirate
crews
in
that
ocean
;
and
though
it
would
take
him
a
long
time
*NL*
to
get
there
without
money
,
he
would
get
there
anyway
,
and
every
time
*NL*
he
convinced
a
pirate
he
would
say
to
him
,
``
Do
n't
you
thank
me
,
do
n't
*NL*
you
give
me
no
credit
;
it
all
belongs
to
them
dear
people
in
Pokeville
*NL*
camp-meeting
,
natural
brothers
and
benefactors
of
the
race
,
and
that
*NL*
dear
preacher
there
,
the
truest
friend
a
pirate
ever
had
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
he
busted
into
tears
,
and
so
did
everybody
.
Then
somebody
*NL*
sings
out
,
``
Take
up
a
collection
for
him
,
take
up
a
collection
!
''
Well
,
*NL*
a
half
a
dozen
made
a
jump
to
do
it
,
but
somebody
sings
out
,
``
Let
*NL*
_
him
_
pass
the
hat
around
!
''
Then
everybody
said
it
,
the
preacher
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
king
went
all
through
the
crowd
with
his
hat
,
swabbing
his
*NL*
eyes
,
and
blessing
the
people
and
praising
them
and
thanking
them
for
*NL*
being
so
good
to
the
poor
pirates
away
off
there
;
and
every
little
*NL*
while
the
prettiest
kind
of
girls
,
with
the
tears
running
down
their
*NL*
cheeks
,
would
up
and
ask
him
would
he
let
them
kiss
him
for
to
*NL*
remember
him
by
;
and
he
always
done
it
;
and
some
of
them
he
hugged
and
*NL*
kissed
as
many
as
five
or
six
times
--
and
he
was
invited
to
stay
a
*NL*
week
;
and
everybody
wanted
him
to
live
in
their
houses
,
and
said
*NL*
they
'd
think
it
was
an
honor
;
but
he
said
as
this
was
the
last
day
of
*NL*
the
camp-meeting
he
could
n't
do
no
good
,
and
besides
he
was
in
a
sweat
*NL*
to
get
to
the
Indian
Ocean
right
off
and
go
to
work
on
the
pirates
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
got
back
to
the
raft
and
he
come
to
count
up
he
found
he
had
*NL*
collected
eighty-seven
dollars
and
seventy-five
cents
.
And
then
he
had
*NL*
fetched
away
a
three-gallon
jug
of
whisky
,
too
,
that
he
found
under
a
*NL*
wagon
when
he
was
starting
home
through
the
woods
.
The
king
said
,
take
*NL*
it
all
around
,
it
laid
over
any
day
he
'd
ever
put
in
in
the
*NL*
missionarying
line
.
He
said
it
war
n't
no
use
talking
,
heathens
do
n't
*NL*
amount
to
shucks
alongside
of
pirates
to
work
a
camp-meeting
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
duke
was
thinking
_
he
'd
_
been
doing
pretty
well
till
the
king
*NL*
come
to
show
up
,
but
after
that
he
did
n't
think
so
so
much
.
He
*NL*
had
set
up
and
printed
off
two
little
jobs
for
farmers
in
that
*NL*
printing-office
--
horse
bills
--
and
took
the
money
,
four
dollars
.
And
he
*NL*
had
got
in
ten
dollars
'
worth
of
advertisements
for
the
paper
,
which
*NL*
he
said
he
would
put
in
for
four
dollars
if
they
would
pay
in
*NL*
advance
--
so
they
done
it
.
The
price
of
the
paper
was
two
dollars
a
*NL*
year
,
but
he
took
in
three
subscriptions
for
half
a
dollar
apiece
on
*NL*
condition
of
them
paying
him
in
advance
;
they
were
going
to
pay
in
*NL*
cordwood
and
onions
as
usual
,
but
he
said
he
had
just
bought
the
*NL*
concern
and
knocked
down
the
price
as
low
as
he
could
afford
it
,
and
*NL*
was
going
to
run
it
for
cash
.
He
set
up
a
little
piece
of
poetry
,
*NL*
which
he
made
,
himself
,
out
of
his
own
head
--
three
verses
--
kind
of
*NL*
sweet
and
saddish
--
the
name
of
it
was
,
``
Yes
,
crush
,
cold
world
,
this
*NL*
breaking
heart
''
--
and
he
left
that
all
set
up
and
ready
to
print
in
the
*NL*
paper
,
and
did
n't
charge
nothing
for
it
.
Well
,
he
took
in
nine
dollars
*NL*
and
a
half
,
and
said
he
'd
done
a
pretty
square
day
's
work
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
showed
us
another
little
job
he
'd
printed
and
had
n't
charged
*NL*
for
,
because
it
was
for
us
.
It
had
a
picture
of
a
runaway
nigger
with
*NL*
a
bundle
on
a
stick
over
his
shoulder
,
and
``
$
200
reward
''
under
it
.
The
*NL*
reading
was
all
about
Jim
and
just
described
him
to
a
dot
.
It
said
he
*NL*
run
away
from
St.
Jacques
's
plantation
,
forty
mile
below
New
Orleans
,
*NL*
last
winter
,
and
likely
went
north
,
and
whoever
would
catch
him
and
*NL*
send
him
back
he
could
have
the
reward
and
expenses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
says
the
duke
,
``
after
to-night
we
can
run
in
the
daytime
if
we
*NL*
want
to
.
Whenever
we
see
anybody
coming
we
can
tie
Jim
hand
and
foot
*NL*
with
a
rope
,
and
lay
him
in
the
wigwam
and
show
this
handbill
and
say
*NL*
we
captured
him
up
the
river
,
and
were
too
poor
to
travel
on
a
*NL*
steamboat
,
so
we
got
this
little
raft
on
credit
from
our
friends
and
*NL*
are
going
down
to
get
the
reward
.
Handcuffs
and
chains
would
look
*NL*
still
better
on
Jim
,
but
it
would
n't
go
well
with
the
story
of
us
*NL*
being
so
poor
.
Too
much
like
jewelry
.
Ropes
are
the
correct
thing
--
we
*NL*
must
preserve
the
unities
,
as
we
say
on
the
boards
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
all
said
the
duke
was
pretty
smart
,
and
there
could
n't
be
no
*NL*
trouble
about
running
daytimes
.
We
judged
we
could
make
miles
enough
*NL*
that
night
to
get
out
of
the
reach
of
the
powwow
we
reckoned
the
*NL*
duke
's
work
in
the
printing-office
was
going
to
make
in
that
little
*NL*
town
;
then
we
could
boom
right
along
if
we
wanted
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
laid
low
and
kept
still
,
and
never
shoved
out
till
nearly
ten
*NL*
o'clock
;
then
we
slid
by
,
pretty
wide
away
from
the
town
,
and
did
n't
*NL*
hoist
our
lantern
till
we
was
clear
out
of
sight
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Jim
called
me
to
take
the
watch
at
four
in
the
morning
,
he
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Huck
,
does
you
reck
'n
we
gwyne
to
run
acrost
any
mo
'
kings
on
dis
*NL*
trip
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
I
says
,
``
I
reckon
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
says
he
,
``
dat
's
all
right

I
doan

'
much
*NL*
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
found
Jim
had
been
trying
to
get
him
to
talk
French
,
so
he
could
*NL*
hear
what
it
was
like
;
but
he
said
he
had
been
in
this
country
so
*NL*
long
,
and
had
so
much
trouble
,
he
'd
forgot
it

CHAPTER
XXI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
after
sun-up
now
,
but
we
went
right
on
and
did
n't
tie
up
.
The
*NL*
king
and
the
duke
turned
out
by
and
by
looking
pretty
rusty
;
but
after
*NL*
they
'd
jumped
overboard
and
took
a
swim
it
chippered
them
up
a
good
*NL*
deal
.
After
breakfast
the
king
he
took
a
seat
on
the
corner
of
the
*NL*
raft
,
and
pulled
off
his
boots
and
rolled
up
his
britches
,
and
let
his
*NL*
legs
dangle
in
the
water
,
so
as
to
be
comfortable
,
and
lit
his
pipe
,
*NL*
and
went
to
getting
his
``
Romeo
and
Juliet
''
by
heart
.
When
he
had
got
*NL*
it
pretty
good
him
and
the
duke
begun
to
practise
it
together
.
The
*NL*
duke
had
to
learn
him
over
and
over
again
how
to
say
every
speech
;
and
*NL*
he
made
him
sigh
,
and
put
his
hand
on
his
heart
,
and
after
a
while
he
*NL*
said
he
done
it
pretty
well
;
``
only
,
''
he
says
,
``
you
must
n't
bellow
out
*NL*
_
Romeo
!
_
that
way
,
like
a
bull
--
you
must
say
it
soft
and
sick
and
*NL*
languishy
,
so
--
R-o-o-meo
!
that
is
the
idea
;
for
Juliet
's
a
dear
sweet
*NL*
mere
child
of
a
girl
,
you
know
,
and
she
does
n't
bray
like
a
jackass
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
next
they
got
out
a
couple
of
long
swords
that
the
duke
made
out
*NL*
of
oak
laths
,
and
begun
to
practise
the
sword-fight
--
the
duke
called
*NL*
himself
Richard
III.
;
and
the
way
they
laid
on
and
pranced
around
the
*NL*
raft
was
grand
to
see
.
But
by
and
by
the
king
tripped
and
fell
*NL*
overboard
,
and
after
that
they
took
a
rest
,
and
had
a
talk
about
all
*NL*
kinds
of
adventures
they
'd
had
in
other
times
along
the
river
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
dinner
the
duke
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Capet
,
we
'll
want
to
make
this
a
first-class
show
,
you
know
,
so
*NL*
I
guess
we
'll
add
a
little
more
to
it
.
We
want
a
little
something
to
*NL*
answer
encores
with
,
anyway
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
onkores
,
Bilgewater
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
duke
told
him
,
and
then
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
answer
by
doing
the
Highland
fling
or
the
sailor
's
hornpipe
;
and
*NL*
you
--
well
,
let
me
see
--
oh
,
I
've
got
it
--
you
can
do
Hamlet
's
*NL*
soliloquy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hamlet
's
which
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hamlet
's
soliloquy
,
you
know
;
the
most
celebrated
thing
in
*NL*
Shakespeare
.
Ah
,
it
's
sublime
,
sublime
!
Always
fetches
the
house
.
I
*NL*
have
n't
got
it
in
the
book
--
I
've
only
got
one
volume
--
but
I
reckon
I
*NL*
can
piece
it
out
from
memory
.
I
'll
just
walk
up
and
down
a
minute
,
and
*NL*
see
if
I
can
call
it
back
from
recollection
's
vaults
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
went
to
marching
up
and
down
,
thinking
,
and
frowning
horrible
*NL*
every
now
and
then
;
then
he
would
hoist
up
his
eyebrows
;
next
he
would
*NL*
squeeze
his
hand
on
his
forehead
and
stagger
back
and
kind
of
moan
;
*NL*
next
he
would
sigh
,
and
next
he
'd
let
on
to
drop
a
tear
.
It
was
*NL*
beautiful
to
see
him
.
By
and
by
he
got
it
.
He
told
us
to
give
*NL*
attention
.
Then
he
strikes
a
most
noble
attitude
,
with
one
leg
shoved
*NL*
forwards
,
and
his
arms
stretched
away
up
,
and
his
head
tilted
back
,
*NL*
looking
up
at
the
sky
;
and
then
he
begins
to
rip
and
rave
and
grit
his
*NL*
teeth
;
and
after
that
,
all
through
his
speech
,
he
howled
,
and
spread
*NL*
around
,
and
swelled
up
his
chest
,
and
just
knocked
the
spots
out
of
*NL*
any
acting
ever
_
I
_
see
before
.
This
is
the
speech
--
I
learned
it
,
easy
*NL*
enough
,
while
he
was
learning
it
to
the
king
:
*NL*
*NL*
To
be
,
or
not
to
be
;
that
is
the
bare
bodkin
*NL*
That
makes
calamity
of
so
long
life
;
*NL*
For
who
would
fardels
bear
,
till
Birnam
Wood
do
come
to
*NL*
Dunsinane
,
*NL*
But
that
the
fear
of
something
after
death
*NL*
Murders
the
innocent
sleep
,
*NL*
Great
nature
's
second
course
,
*NL*
And
makes
us
rather
sling
the
arrows
of
outrageous
fortune
*NL*
Than
fly
to
others
that
we
know
not
of
.
*NL*
There
's
the
respect
must
give
us
pause
:
*NL*
Wake
Duncan
with
thy
knocking
!
I
would
thou
couldst
;
*NL*
For
who
would
bear
the
whips
and
scorns
of
time
,
*NL*
The
oppressor
's
wrong
,
the
proud
man
's
contumely
,
*NL*
The
law
's
delay
,
and
the
quietus
which
his
pangs
might
take
,
*NL*
In
the
dead
waste
and
middle
of
the
night
,
when
churchyards
*NL*
yawn
*NL*
In
customary
suits
of
solemn
black
,
*NL*
But
that
the
undiscovered
country
from
whose
bourne
no
*NL*
traveler
returns
,
*NL*
Breathes
forth
contagion
on
the
world
,
*NL*
And
thus
the
native
hue
of
resolution
,
like
the
poor
cat
i
'
the
*NL*
adage
,
*NL*
Is
sicklied
o'er
with
care
,
*NL*
And
all
the
clouds
that
lowered
o'er
our
housetops
,
*NL*
With
this
regard
their
currents
turn
awry
,
*NL*
And
lose
the
name
of
action
.
*NL*
'T
is
a
consummation
devoutly
to
be
wished
.
But
soft
you
,
the
*NL*
fair
Ophelia
:
*NL*
Ope
not
thy
ponderous
and
marble
jaws
,
*NL*
But
get
thee
to
a
nunnery
--
go
!
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
the
old
man
he
liked
that
speech
,
and
he
mighty
soon
got
it
so
*NL*
he
could
do
it
first
rate
.
It
seemed
like
he
was
just
born
for
it
;
and
*NL*
when
he
had
his
hand
in
and
was
excited
,
it
was
perfectly
lovely
the
*NL*
way
he
would
rip
and
tear
and
rair
up
behind
when
he
was
getting
it
*NL*
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
chance
we
got
the
duke
he
had
some
show-bills
printed
;
and
*NL*
after
that
,
for
two
or
three
days
as
we
floated
along
,
the
raft
was
a
*NL*
most
uncommon
lively
place
,
for
there
war
n't
nothing
but
*NL*
sword-fighting
and
rehearsing
--
as
the
duke
called
it
--
going
on
all
the
*NL*
time
.
One
morning
,
when
we
was
pretty
well
down
the
state
of
Arkansaw
,
*NL*
we
come
in
sight
of
a
little
one-horse
town
in
a
big
bend
;
so
we
tied
*NL*
up
about
three-quarters
of
a
mile
above
it
,
in
the
mouth
of
a
crick
*NL*
which
was
shut
in
like
a
tunnel
by
the
cypress
trees
,
and
all
of
us
*NL*
but
Jim
took
the
canoe
and
went
down
there
to
see
if
there
was
any
*NL*
chance
in
that
place
for
our
show
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
struck
it
mighty
lucky
;
there
was
going
to
be
a
circus
there
that
*NL*
afternoon
,
and
the
country-people
was
already
beginning
to
come
in
,
in
*NL*
all
kinds
of
old
shackly
wagons
,
and
on
horses
.
The
circus
would
leave
*NL*
before
night
,
so
our
show
would
have
a
pretty
good
chance
.
The
duke
he
*NL*
hired
the
court-house
,
and
we
went
around
and
stuck
up
our
bills
.
They
*NL*
read
like

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Then
we
went
loafing
around
town
.
The
stores
and
houses
was
most
all
*NL*
old
,
shackly
,
dried-up
frame
concerns
that
had
n't
ever
been
painted
;
*NL*
they
was
set
up
three
or
four
foot
above
ground
on
stilts
,
so
as
to
be
*NL*
out
of
reach
of
the
water
when
the
river
was
overflowed
.
The
houses
*NL*
had
little
gardens
around
them
,
but
they
did
n't
seem
to
raise
hardly
*NL*
anything
in
them
but
jimpson-weeds
,
and
sunflowers
,
and
ash-piles
,
and
*NL*
old
curled-up
boots
and
shoes
,
and
pieces
of
bottles
,
and
rags
,
and
*NL*
played-out
tinware
.
The
fences
was
made
of
different
kinds
of
boards
,
*NL*
nailed
on
at
different
times
;
and
they
leaned
every
which
way
,
and
had
*NL*
gates
that
did
n't
generly
have
but
one
hinge
--
a
leather
one
.
Some
of
*NL*
the
fences
had
been
whitewashed
some
time
or
another
,
but
the
duke
*NL*
said
it
was
in
Columbus
's
time
,
like
enough
.
There
was
generly
hogs
in
*NL*
the
garden
,
and
people
driving
them
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
stores
was
along
one
street
.
They
had
white
domestic
awnings
*NL*
in
front
,
and
the
country-people
hitched
their
horses
to
the
*NL*
awning-posts
.
There
was
empty
dry-goods
boxes
under
the
awnings
,
and
*NL*
loafers
roosting
on
them
all
day
long
,
whittling
them
with
their
*NL*
Barlow
knives
;
and
chawing
tobacco
,
and
gaping
and
yawning
and
*NL*
stretching
--
a
mighty
ornery
lot
.
They
generly
had
on
yellow
straw
hats
*NL*
most
as
wide
as
an
umbrella
,
but
did
n't
wear
no
coats
nor
waistcoats
;
*NL*
they
called
one
another
Bill
,
and
Buck
,
and
Hank
,
and
Joe
,
and
Andy
,
*NL*
and
talked
lazy
and
drawly
,
and
used
considerable
many
cuss-words
.
*NL*
There
was
as
many
as
one
loafer
leaning
up
against
every
awning-post
,
*NL*
and
he
most
always
had
his
hands
in
his
britches
pockets
,
except
when
*NL*
he
fetched
them
out
to
lend
a
chaw
of
tobacco
or
scratch
.
What
a
body
*NL*
was
hearing
amongst
them
all
the
time
was
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gim
me
a
chaw
'
v
tobacker
,
Hank
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cai
n't
;
I
hai
n't
got
but
one
chaw
left
.
Ask
Bill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maybe
Bill
he
gives
him
a
chaw
;
maybe
he
lies
and
says
he
ai
n't
got
*NL*
none
.
Some
of
them
kinds
of
loafers
never
has
a
cent
in
the
world
,
nor
*NL*
a
chaw
of
tobacco
of
their
own
.
They
get
all
their
chawing
by
*NL*
borrowing
;
they
say
to
a
fellow
,
``
I
wisht
you
'd
len
'
me
a
chaw
,
Jack
,
*NL*
I
jist
this
minute
give
Ben
Thompson
the
last
chaw
I
had
''
--
which
is
a
*NL*
lie
pretty
much
every
time
;
it
do
n't
fool
nobody
but
a
stranger
;
but
*NL*
Jack
ai
n't
no
stranger
,
so
he
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
You
_
give
him
a
chaw
,
did
you
?
So
did
your
sister
's
cat
's
*NL*
grandmother
.
You
pay
me
back
the
chaws
you
've
awready
borry
'd
off
'n
*NL*
me
,
Lafe

,
then
I
'll
loan
you
one
or
two
ton
of
it
,
and
wo
n't
*NL*
charge
you
no
back

,
nuther
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
_
did
_
pay
you
back
some
of
it
wunst
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
did
--
`
bout
six
chaws
.
You
borry
'd

tobacker
and
paid
*NL*
back

''
*NL*
*NL*
Store
tobacco
is
flat
black
plug
,
but
these
fellows
mostly
chaws
the
*NL*
natural
leaf
twisted
.
When
they
borrow
a
chaw
they
do
n't
generly
cut
*NL*
it
off
with
a
knife
,
but
set
the
plug
in
between
their
teeth
,
and
gnaw
*NL*
with
their
teeth
and
tug
at
the
plug
with
their
hands
till
they
get
it
*NL*
in
two
;
then
sometimes
the
one
that
owns
the
tobacco
looks
mournful
at
*NL*
it
when
it
's
handed
back
,
and
says
,
sarcastic
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
gim
me
the
_
chaw
_
,
and
you
take
the
_
plug

All
the
streets
and
lanes
was
just
mud
;
they
war
n't
nothing
else
_
but
_
*NL*
mud
--
mud
as
black
as
tar
and
nigh
about
a
foot
deep
in
some
places
,
*NL*
and
two
or
three
inches
deep
in
_
all
_
the
places
.
The
hogs
loafed
and
*NL*
grunted
around
everywheres
.
You
'd
see
a
muddy
sow
and
a
litter
of
*NL*
pigs
come
lazying
along
the
street
and
whollop
herself
right
down
in
*NL*
the
way
,
where
folks
had
to
walk
around
her
,
and
she
'd
stretch
out
and
*NL*
shut
her
eyes
and
wave
her
ears
whilst
the
pigs
was
milking
her
,
and
*NL*
look
as
happy
as
if
she
was
on
salary
.
And
pretty
soon
you
'd
hear
a
*NL*
loafer
sing
out
,
``
Hi
!
_
so
_
boy
!
sick
him
,
Tige
!
''
and
away
the
sow
*NL*
would
go
,
squealing
most
horrible
,
with
a
dog
or
two
swinging
to
each
*NL*
ear
,
and
three
or
four
dozen
more
a-coming
;
and
then
you
would
see
all
*NL*
the
loafers
get
up
and
watch
the
thing
out
of
sight
,
and
laugh
at
the
*NL*
fun
and
look
grateful
for
the
noise
.
Then
they
'd
settle
back
again
*NL*
till
there
was
a
dog-fight
.
There
could
n't
anything
wake
them
up
all
*NL*
over
,
and
make
them
happy
all
over
,
like
a
dog-fight
--
unless
it
might
*NL*
be
putting
turpentine
on
a
stray
dog
and
setting
fire
to
him
,
or
tying
*NL*
a
tin
pan
to
his
tail
and
see
him
run
himself
to
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
river-front
some
of
the
houses
was
sticking
out
over
the
bank
,
*NL*
and
they
was
bowed
and
bent
,
and
about
ready
to
tumble
in
.
The
people
*NL*
had
moved
out
of
them
.
The
bank
was
caved
away
under
one
corner
of
*NL*
some
others
,
and
that
corner
was
hanging
over
.
People
lived
in
them
*NL*
yet
,
but
it
was
dangersome
,
because
sometimes
a
strip
of
land
as
wide
*NL*
as
a
house
caves
in
at
a
time
.
Sometimes
a
belt
of
land
a
quarter
of
a
*NL*
mile
deep
will
start
in
and
cave
along
and
cave
along
till
it
all
*NL*
caves
into
the
river
in
one
summer
.
Such
a
town
as
that
has
to
be
*NL*
always
moving
back
,
and
back
,
and
back
,
because
the
river
's
always
*NL*
gnawing
at
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
nearer
it
got
to
noon
that
day
the
thicker
and
thicker
was
the
*NL*
wagons
and
horses
in
the
streets
,
and
more
coming
all
the
time
.
*NL*
Families
fetched
their
dinners
with
them
from
the
country
,
and
eat
*NL*
them
in
the
wagons
.
There
was
considerable
whisky-drinking
going
on
,
*NL*
and
I
seen
three
fights
.
By
and
by
somebody
sings
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
comes
old
Boggs
!
--
in
from
the
country
for
his
little
old
monthly
*NL*
drunk
;
here
he
comes
,
boys
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
loafers
looked
glad
;
I
reckoned
they
was
used
to
having
fun
*NL*
out
of
Boggs
.
One
of
them
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wonder
who
he
's
a-gwyne
to
chaw
up
this
time
.
If
he
'd
a-chawed
up
all
*NL*
the
men
he
's
ben
a-gwyne
to
chaw
up
in
the
last
twenty
year
he
'd
have
*NL*
considerable
ruputation
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Another
one
says
,
``
I
wisht
old
Boggs
'd
threaten
me
,
`
cuz
then
I
'd
*NL*
know
I
war
n't
gwyne
to
die
for
a
thousan
'
year
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Boggs
comes
a-tearing
along
on
his
horse
,
whooping
and
yelling
like
an
*NL*
Injun
,
and
singing
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cler
the
track
,
thar
.
I
'm
on
the
waw-path
,
and
the
price
uv
coffins
*NL*
is
a-gwyne
to
raise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
drunk
,
and
weaving
about
in
his
saddle
;
he
was
over
fifty
year
*NL*
old
,
and
had
a
very
red
face
.
Everybody
yelled
at
him
and
laughed
at
*NL*
him
and
sassed
him
,
and
he
sassed
back
,
and
said
he
'd
attend
to
them
*NL*
and
lay
them
out
in
their
regular
turns
,
but
he
could
n't
wait
now
*NL*
because
he
'd
come
to
town
to
kill
old
Colonel
Sherburn
,
and
his
motto
*NL*
was
,
``
Meat
first
,
and
spoon
vittles
to
top
off
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
see
me
,
and
rode
up
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whar
'd
you
come
f
'm
,
boy
?
You
prepared
to
die
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
rode
on
.
I
was
scared
,
but
a
man
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
do
n't
mean
nothing
;
he
's
always
a-carryin
'
on
like
that
when
he
's
*NL*
drunk
.
He
's
the
best-naturedest
old
fool
in
Arkansaw
--
never
hurt
*NL*
nobody
,
drunk
nor
sober
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Boggs
rode
up
before
the
biggest
store
in
town
,
and
bent
his
head
down
*NL*
so
he
could
see
under
the
curtain
of
the
awning
and
yells
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
out
here
,
Sherburn
!
Come
out
and
meet
the
man
you
've
swindled
.
*NL*
You
're
the
houn
'
I
'm
after
,
and
I
'm
a-gwyne
to
have
you
,
too
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
he
went
on
,
calling
Sherburn
everything
he
could
lay
his
tongue
*NL*
to
,
and
the
whole
street
packed
with
people
listening
and
laughing
and
*NL*
going
on
.
By
and
by
a
proud-looking
man
about
fifty-five
--
and
he
was
a
*NL*
heap
the
best-dressed
man
in
that
town
,
too
--
steps
out
of
the
store
,
*NL*
and
the
crowd
drops
back
on
each
side
to
let
him
come
.
He
says
to
*NL*
Boggs
,
mighty
ca
'm
and
slow
--
he
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
tired
of
this
,
but
I
'll
endure
it
till
one
o'clock
.
Till
one
*NL*
o'clock
,
mind
--
no
longer
.
If
you
open
your
mouth
against
me
only
once
*NL*
after
that
time
you
ca
n't
travel
so
far
but
I
will
find
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
turns
and
goes
in
.
The
crowd
looked
mighty
sober
;
nobody
*NL*
stirred
,
and
there
war
n't
no
more
laughing
.
Boggs
rode
off
*NL*
blackguarding
Sherburn
as
loud
as
he
could
yell
,
all
down
the
street
;
*NL*
and
pretty
soon
back
he
comes
and
stops
before
the
store
,
still
*NL*
keeping
it
up
.
Some
men
crowded
around
him
and
tried
to
get
him
to
*NL*
shut
up
,
but
he
would
n't
;
they
told
him
it
would
be
one
o'clock
in
*NL*
about
fifteen
minutes
,
and
so
he
_
must
_
go
home
--
he
must
go
right
*NL*
away
.
But
it
did
n't
do
no
good
.
He
cussed
away
with
all
his
might
,
and
*NL*
throwed
his
hat
down
in
the
mud
and
rode
over
it
,
and
pretty
soon
away
*NL*
he
went
a-raging
down
the
street
again
,
with
his
gray
hair
a-flying
.
*NL*
Everybody
that
could
get
a
chance
at
him
tried
their
best
to
coax
him
*NL*
off
of
his
horse
so
they
could
lock
him
up
and
get
him
sober
;
but
it
*NL*
war
n't
no
use
--
up
the
street
he
would
tear
again
,
and
give
Sherburn
*NL*
another
cussing
.
By
and
by
somebody
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
for
his
daughter
!
--
quick
,
go
for
his
daughter
;
sometimes
he
'll
*NL*
listen
to
her
.
If
anybody
can
persuade
him
,
she
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
somebody
started
on
a
run
.
I
walked
down
street
a
ways
and
stopped
.
*NL*
In
about
five
or
ten
minutes
here
comes
Boggs
again
,
but
not
on
his
*NL*
horse
.
He
was
a-reeling
across
the
street
towards
me
,
bareheaded
,
with
*NL*
a
friend
on
both
sides
of
him
a-holt
of
his
arms
and
hurrying
him
*NL*
along
.
He
was
quiet
,
and
looked
uneasy
;
and
he
war
n't
hanging
back
*NL*
any
,
but
was
doing
some
of
the
hurrying
himself
.
Somebody
sings
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Boggs
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
looked
over
there
to
see
who
said
it
,
and
it
was
that
Colonel
*NL*
Sherburn
.
He
was
standing
perfectly
still
in
the
street
,
and
had
a
*NL*
pistol
raised
in
his
right
hand
--
not
aiming
it
,
but
holding
it
out
*NL*
with
the
barrel
tilted
up
towards
the
sky
.
The
same
second
I
see
a
*NL*
young
girl
coming
on
the
run
,
and
two
men
with
her
.
Boggs
and
the
men
*NL*
turned
round
to
see
who
called
him
,
and
when
they
see
the
pistol
the
*NL*
men
jumped
to
one
side
,
and
the
pistol-barrel
come
down
slow
and
*NL*
steady
to
a
level
--
both
barrels
cocked
.
Boggs
throws
up
both
of
his
*NL*
hands
and
says
,
``
O
Lord
,
do
n't
shoot
!
''
Bang
!
goes
the
first
shot
,
and
*NL*
he
staggers
back
,
clawing
at
the
air
--
bang
!
goes
the
second
one
,
and
*NL*
he
tumbles
backwards
onto
the
ground
,
heavy
and
solid
,
with
his
arms
*NL*
spread
out
.
That
young
girl
screamed
out
and
comes
rushing
,
and
down
*NL*
she
throws
herself
on
her
father
,
crying
,
and
saying
,
``
Oh
,
he
's
killed
*NL*
him
,
he
's
killed
him
!
''
The
crowd
closed
up
around
them
,
and
shouldered
*NL*
and
jammed
one
another
,
with
their
necks
stretched
,
trying
to
see
,
and
*NL*
people
on
the
inside
trying
to
shove
them
back
and
shouting
,
``
Back
,
*NL*
back
!
give
him
air
,
give
him
air
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Colonel
Sherburn
he
tossed
his
pistol
onto
the
ground
,
and
turned
*NL*
around
on
his
heels
and
walked
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
took
Boggs
to
a
little
drug
store
,
the
crowd
pressing
around
just
*NL*
the
same
,
and
the
whole
town
following
,
and
I
rushed
and
got
a
good
*NL*
place
at
the
window
,
where
I
was
close
to
him
and
could
see
in
.
They
*NL*
laid
him
on
the
floor
and
put
one
large
Bible
under
his
head
,
and
*NL*
opened
another
one
and
spread
it
on
his
breast
;
but
they
tore
open
his
*NL*
shirt
first
,
and
I
seen
where
one
of
the
bullets
went
in
.
He
made
*NL*
about
a
dozen
long
gasps
,
his
breast
lifting
the
Bible
up
when
he
*NL*
drawed
in
his
breath
,
and
letting
it
down
again
when
he
breathed
it
*NL*
out
--
and
after
that
he
laid
still
;
he
was
dead
.
Then
they
pulled
his
*NL*
daughter
away
from
him
,
screaming
and
crying
,
and
took
her
off
.
She
*NL*
was
about
sixteen
,
and
very
sweet
and
gentle
looking
,
but
awful
pale
*NL*
and
scared
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
pretty
soon
the
whole
town
was
there
,
squirming
and
scrouging
*NL*
and
pushing
and
shoving
to
get
at
the
window
and
have
a
look
,
but
*NL*
people
that
had
the
places
would
n't
give
them
up
,
and
folks
behind
*NL*
them
was
saying
all
the
time
,
``
Say
,
now
,
you
've
looked
enough
,
you
*NL*
fellows
;
`
tai
n't
right
and
`
tai
n't
fair
for
you
to
stay
thar
all
the
*NL*
time
,
and
never
give
nobody
a
chance
;
other
folks
has
their
rights
as
*NL*
well
as
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
considerable
jawing
back
,
so
I
slid
out
,
thinking
maybe
*NL*
there
was
going
to
be
trouble
.
The
streets
was
full
,
and
everybody
was
*NL*
excited
.
Everybody
that
seen
the
shooting
was
telling
how
it
happened
,
*NL*
and
there
was
a
big
crowd
packed
around
each
one
of
these
fellows
,
*NL*
stretching
their
necks
and
listening
.
One
long
,
lanky
man
,
with
long
*NL*
hair
and
a
big
white
fur
stovepipe
hat
on
the
back
of
his
head
,
and
a
*NL*
crooked-handled
cane
,
marked
out
the
places
on
the
ground
where
Boggs
*NL*
stood
and
where
Sherburn
stood
,
and
the
people
following
him
around
*NL*
from
one
place
to
t
`
other
and
watching
everything
he
done
,
and
bobbing
*NL*
their
heads
to
show
they
understood
,
and
stooping
a
little
and
resting
*NL*
their
hands
on
their
thighs
to
watch
him
mark
the
places
on
the
ground
*NL*
with
his
cane
;
and
then
he
stood
up
straight
and
stiff
where
Sherburn
*NL*
had
stood
,
frowning
and
having
his
hat-brim
down
over
his
eyes
,
and
*NL*
sung
out
,
``
Boggs
!
''
and
then
fetched
his
cane
down
slow
to
a
level
,
and
*NL*
says
``
Bang
!
''
staggered
backwards
,
says
``
Bang
!
''
again
,
and
fell
down
*NL*
flat
on
his
back
.
The
people
that
had
seen
the
thing
said
he
done
it
*NL*
perfect
;
said
it
was
just
exactly
the
way
it
all
happened
.
Then
as
*NL*
much
as
a
dozen
people
got
out
their
bottles
and
treated
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
by
and
by
somebody
said
Sherburn
ought
to
be
lynched
.
In
about
a
*NL*
minute
everybody
was
saying
it
;
so
away
they
went
,
mad
and
yelling
,
*NL*
and
snatching
down
every
clothes-line
they
come
to
to
do
the
hanging
*NL*
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
XXII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
They
swarmed
up
towards
Sherburn
's
house
,
a-whooping
and
raging
like
*NL*
Injuns
,
and
everything
had
to
clear
the
way
or
get
run
over
and
*NL*
tromped
to
mush
,
and
it
was
awful
to
see
.
Children
was
heeling
it
*NL*
ahead
of
the
mob
,
screaming
and
trying
to
get
out
of
the
way
;
and
*NL*
every
window
along
the
road
was
full
of
women
's
heads
,
and
there
was
*NL*
nigger
boys
in
every
tree
,
and
bucks
and
wenches
looking
over
every
*NL*
fence
;
and
as
soon
as
the
mob
would
get
nearly
to
them
they
would
*NL*
break
and
skaddle
back
out
of
reach
.
Lots
of
the
women
and
girls
was
*NL*
crying
and
taking
on
,
scared
most
to
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
swarmed
up
in
front
of
Sherburn
's
palings
as
thick
as
they
could
*NL*
jam
together
,
and
you
could
n't
hear
yourself
think
for
the
noise
.
It
*NL*
was
a
little
twenty-foot
yard
.
Some
sung
out
``
Tear
down
the
fence
!
*NL*
tear
down
the
fence
!
''
Then
there
was
a
racket
of
ripping
and
tearing
*NL*
and
smashing
,
and
down
she
goes
,
and
the
front
wall
of
the
crowd
*NL*
begins
to
roll
in
like
a
wave
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
then
Sherburn
steps
out
onto
the
roof
of
his
little
front
porch
,
*NL*
with
a
double-barrel
gun
in
his
hand
,
and
takes
his
stand
,
perfectly
*NL*
ca
'm
and
deliberate
,
not
saying
a
word
.
The
racket
stopped
,
and
the
*NL*
wave
sucked
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sherburn
never
said
a
word
--
just
stood
there
,
looking
down
.
The
*NL*
stillness
was
awful
creepy
and
uncomfortable
.
Sherburn
run
his
eye
*NL*
slow
along
the
crowd
;
and
wherever
it
struck
the
people
tried
a
little
*NL*
to
outgaze
him
,
but
they
could
n't
;
they
dropped
their
eyes
and
looked
*NL*
sneaky
.
Then
pretty
soon
Sherburn
sort
of
laughed
;
not
the
pleasant
*NL*
kind
,
but
the
kind
that
makes
you
feel
like
when
you
are
eating
bread
*NL*
that
's
got
sand
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
says
,
slow
and
scornful
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
idea
of
_
you
_
lynching
anybody
!
It
's
amusing
.
The
idea
of
you
*NL*
thinking
you
had
pluck
enough
to
lynch
a
_
man
!
_
Because
you
're
brave
*NL*
enough
to
tar
and
feather
poor
friendless
cast-out
women
that
come
*NL*
along
here
,
did
that
make
you
think
you
had
grit
enough
to
lay
your
*NL*
hands
on
a
_
man
?
_
Why
,
a
_
man
's
_
safe
in
the
hands
of
ten
thousand
of
*NL*
your
kind
--
as
long
as
it
's
daytime
and
you
're
not
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
I
know
you
?
I
know
you
clear
through
.
I
was
born
and
raised
in
the
*NL*
South
,
and
I
've
lived
in
the
North
;
so
I
know
the
average
all
around
.
*NL*
The
average
man
's
a
coward
.
In
the
North
he
lets
anybody
walk
over
him
*NL*
that
wants
to
,
and
goes
home
and
prays
for
a
humble
spirit
to
bear
it
.
*NL*
In
the
South
one
man
,
all
by
himself
,
has
stopped
a
stage
full
of
men
*NL*
in
the
daytime
,
and
robbed
the
lot
.
Your
newspapers
call
you
a
brave
*NL*
people
so
much
that
you
think
you
are
braver
than
any
other
*NL*
people
--
whereas
you
're
just
_
as
_
brave
,
and
no
braver
.
Why
do
n't
your
*NL*
juries
hang
murderers
?
Because
they
're
afraid
the
man
's
friends
will
*NL*
shoot
them
in
the
back
,
in
the
dark
--
and
it
's
just
what
they
_
would
_
*NL*
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
they
always
acquit
;
and
then
a
_
man
_
goes
in
the
night
,
with
a
*NL*
hundred
masked
cowards
at
his
back
,
and
lynches
the
rascal
.
Your
*NL*
mistake
is
,
that
you
did
n't
bring
a
man
with
you
;
that
's
one
mistake
,
*NL*
and
the
other
is
that
you
did
n't
come
in
the
dark
and
fetch
your
*NL*
masks
.
You
brought
_
part
_
of
a
man
--
Buck
Harkness
,
there
--
and
if
you
*NL*
had
n't
had
him
to
start
you
,
you
'd
`
a
'
taken
it
out
in
blowing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
n't
want
to
come
.
The
average
man
do
n't
like
trouble
and
*NL*
danger
.
_
You
_
do
n't
like
trouble
and
danger
.
But
if
only
_
half
_
a
*NL*
man
--
like
Buck
Harkness
,
there
--
shouts
`
Lynch
him
!
lynch
him
!
'
you
're
*NL*
afraid
to
back
down
--
afraid
you
'll
be
found
out
to
be
what
you
*NL*
are
--
_
cowards
_
--
and
so
you
raise
a
yell
,
and
hang
yourselves
onto
that
*NL*
half-a-man
's
coat-tail
,
and
come
raging
up
here
,
swearing
what
big
*NL*
things
you
're
going
to
do
.
The
pitifulest
thing
out
is
a
mob
;
that
's
*NL*
what
an
army
is
--
a
mob
;
they
do
n't
fight
with
courage
that
's
born
in
*NL*
them
,
but
with
courage
that
's
borrowed
from
their
mass
,
and
from
their
*NL*
officers
.
But
a
mob
without
any
_
man
_
at
the
head
of
it
is
_
beneath
_
*NL*
pitifulness
.
Now
the
thing
for
_
you
_
to
do
is
to
droop
your
tails
and
*NL*
go
home
and
crawl
in
a
hole
.
If
any
real
lynching
's
going
to
be
done
*NL*
it
will
be
done
in
the
dark
,
Southern
fashion
;
and
when
they
come
*NL*
they
'll
bring
their
masks
,
and
fetch
a
_
man
_
along
.
Now
_
leave
_
--
and
*NL*
take
your
half-a-man
with
you
''
--
tossing
his
gun
up
across
his
left
arm
*NL*
and
cocking
it
when
he
says
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
crowd
washed
back
sudden
,
and
then
broke
all
apart
,
and
went
*NL*
tearing
off
every
which
way
,
and
Buck
Harkness
he
heeled
it
after
*NL*
them
,
looking
tolerable
cheap
.
I
could
`
a
'
stayed
if
I
wanted
to
,
but
*NL*
I
did
n't
want
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
to
the
circus
and
loafed
around
the
back
side
till
the
watchman
*NL*
went
by
,
and
then
dived
in
under
the
tent
.
I
had
my
twenty-dollar
gold
*NL*
piece
and
some
other
money
,
but
I
reckoned
I
better
save
it
,
because
*NL*
there
ai
n't
no
telling
how
soon
you
are
going
to
need
it
,
away
from
*NL*
home
and
amongst
strangers
that
way
.
You
ca
n't
be
too
careful
.
I
ai
n't
*NL*
opposed
to
spending
money
on
circuses
when
there
ai
n't
no
other
way
,
*NL*
but
there
ai
n't
no
use
in
_
wasting
_
it
on
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
real
bully
circus
.
It
was
the
splendidest
sight
that
ever
was
*NL*
when
they
all
come
riding
in
,
two
and
two
,
and
gentleman
and
lady
,
*NL*
side
by
side
,
the
men
just
in
their
drawers
and
undershirts
,
and
no
*NL*
shoes
nor
stirrups
,
and
resting
their
hands
on
their
thighs
easy
and
*NL*
comfortable
--
there
must
`
a
'
been
twenty
of
them
--
and
every
lady
with
a
*NL*
lovely
complexion
,
and
perfectly
beautiful
,
and
looking
just
like
a
*NL*
gang
of
real
sure-enough
queens
,
and
dressed
in
clothes
that
cost
*NL*
millions
of
dollars
,
and
just
littered
with
diamonds
.
It
was
a
*NL*
powerful
fine
sight
;
I
never
see
anything
so
lovely
.
And
then
one
by
*NL*
one
they
got
up
and
stood
,
and
went
a-weaving
around
the
ring
so
*NL*
gentle
and
wavy
and
graceful
,
the
men
looking
ever
so
tall
and
airy
*NL*
and
straight
,
with
their
heads
bobbing
and
skimming
along
,
away
up
*NL*
there
under
the
tent-roof
,
and
every
lady
's
rose-leafy
dress
flapping
*NL*
soft
and
silky
around
her
hips
,
and
she
looking
like
the
most
*NL*
loveliest
parasol
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
faster
and
faster
they
went
,
all
of
them
dancing
,
first
one
*NL*
foot
out
in
the
air
and
then
the
other
,
the
horses
leaning
more
and
*NL*
more
,
and
the
ringmaster
going
round
and
round
the
center
pole
,
*NL*
cracking
his
whip
and
shouting
``
Hi
!
--
hi
!
''
and
the
clown
cracking
jokes
*NL*
behind
him
;
and
by
and
by
all
hands
dropped
the
reins
,
and
every
lady
*NL*
put
her
knuckles
on
her
hips
and
every
gentleman
folded
his
arms
,
and
*NL*
then
how
the
horses
did
lean
over
and
hump
themselves
!
And
so
one
*NL*
after
the
other
they
all
skipped
off
into
the
ring
,
and
made
the
*NL*
sweetest
bow
I
ever
see
,
and
then
scampered
out
,
and
everybody
clapped
*NL*
their
hands
and
went
just
about
wild
.
Well
,
all
through
the
circus
*NL*
they
done
the
most
astonishing
things
;
and
all
the
time
that
clown
*NL*
carried
on
so
it
most
killed
the
people
.
The
ringmaster
could
n't
ever
*NL*
say
a
word
to
him
but
he
was
back
at
him
quick
as
a
wink
with
the
*NL*
funniest
things
a
body
ever
said
;
and
how
he
ever
_
could
_
think
of
so
*NL*
many
of
them
,
and
so
sudden
and
so
pat
,
was
what
I
could
n't
no
way
*NL*
understand
.
Why
,
I
could
n't
`
a
'
thought
of
them
in
a
year
.
And
by
and
*NL*
by
a
drunken
man
tried
to
get
into
the
ring
--
said
he
wanted
to
ride
;
*NL*
said
he
could
ride
as
well
as
anybody
that
ever
was
.
They
argued
and
*NL*
tried
to
keep
him
out
,
but
he
would
n't
listen
,
and
the
whole
show
come
*NL*
to
a
standstill
.
Then
the
people
begun
to
holler
at
him
and
make
fun
*NL*
of
him
,
and
that
made
him
mad
,
and
he
begun
to
rip
and
tear
;
so
that
*NL*
stirred
up
the
people
,
and
a
lot
of
men
begun
to
pile
down
off
of
the
*NL*
benches
and
swarm
toward
the
ring
,
saying
,
``
Knock
him
down
!
throw
him
*NL*
out
!
''
and
one
or
two
women
begun
to
scream
.
So
,
then
,
the
ringmaster
*NL*
he
made
a
little
speech
,
and
said
he
hoped
there
would
n't
be
no
*NL*
disturbance
,
and
if
the
man
would
promise
he
would
n't
make
no
more
*NL*
trouble
he
would
let
him
ride
if
he
thought
he
could
stay
on
the
*NL*
horse
.
So
everybody
laughed
and
said
all
right
,
and
the
man
got
on
.
*NL*
The
minute
he
was
on
,
the
horse
begun
to
rip
and
tear
and
jump
and
*NL*
cavort
around
,
with
two
circus
men
hanging
on
to
his
bridle
trying
to
*NL*
hold
him
,
and
the
drunk
man
hanging
on
to
his
neck
,
and
his
heels
*NL*
flying
in
the
air
every
jump
,
and
the
whole
crowd
of
people
standing
*NL*
up
shouting
and
laughing
till
tears
rolled
down
.
And
at
last
,
sure
*NL*
enough
,
all
the
circus
men
could
do
,
the
horse
broke
loose
,
and
away
*NL*
he
went
like
the
very
nation
,
round
and
round
the
ring
,
with
that
sot
*NL*
laying
down
on
him
and
hanging
to
his
neck
,
with
first
one
leg
hanging
*NL*
most
to
the
ground
on
one
side
,
and
then
t
`
other
one
on
t
`
other
side
,
*NL*
and
the
people
just
crazy
.
It
war
n't
funny
to
me
,
though
;
I
was
all
of
*NL*
a
tremble
to
see
his
danger
.
But
pretty
soon
he
struggled
up
astraddle
*NL*
and
grabbed
the
bridle
,
a-reeling
this
way
and
that
;
and
the
next
*NL*
minute
he
sprung
up
and
dropped
the
bridle
and
stood
!
and
the
horse
*NL*
a-going
like
a
house
afire
,
too
.
He
just
stood
up
there
,
a-sailing
*NL*
around
as
easy
and
comfortable
as
if
he
war
n't
ever
drunk
in
his
*NL*
life
--
and
then
he
begun
to
pull
off
his
clothes
and
sling
them
.
He
*NL*
shed
them
so
thick
they
kind
of
clogged
up
the
air
,
and
altogether
he
*NL*
shed
seventeen
suits
.
And
,
then
,
there
he
was
,
slim
and
handsome
,
and
*NL*
dressed
the
gaudiest
and
prettiest
you
ever
saw
,
and
he
lit
into
that
*NL*
horse
with
his
whip
and
made
him
fairly
hum
--
and
finally
skipped
off
,
*NL*
and
made
his
bow
and
danced
off
to
the
dressing-room
,
and
everybody
*NL*
just
a-howling
with
pleasure
and
astonishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
ringmaster
he
see
how
he
had
been
fooled
,
and
he
_
was
_
the
*NL*
sickest
ringmaster
you
ever
see
,
I
reckon
.
Why
,
it
was
one
of
his
own
*NL*
men
!
He
had
got
up
that
joke
all
out
of
his
own
head
,
and
never
let
on
*NL*
to
nobody
.
Well
,
I
felt
sheepish
enough
to
be
took
in
so
,
but
I
*NL*
would
n't
`
a
'
been
in
that
ringmaster
's
place
,
not
for
a
thousand
*NL*
dollars
.
I
do
n't
know
;
there
may
be
bullier
circuses
than
what
that
*NL*
one
was
,
but
I
never
struck
them
yet
.
Anyways
,
it
was
plenty
good
*NL*
enough
for
_
me
_
;
and
wherever
I
run
across
it
,
it
can
have
all
of
_
my
_
*NL*
custom
every
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
that
night
we
had
_
our
_
show
;
but
there
war
n't
only
about
twelve
*NL*
people
there
--
just
enough
to
pay
expenses
.
And
they
laughed
all
the
*NL*
time
,
and
that
made
the
duke
mad
;
and
everybody
left
,
anyway
,
before
*NL*
the
show
was
over
,
but
one
boy
which
was
asleep
.
So
the
duke
said
*NL*
these
Arkansaw
lunkheads
could
n't
come
up
to
Shakespeare
;
what
they
*NL*
wanted
was
low
comedy
--
and
maybe
something
ruther
worse
than
low
*NL*
comedy
,
he
reckoned
.
He
said
he
could
size
their
style
.
So
next
*NL*
morning
he
got
some
big
sheets
of
wrapping-paper
and
some
black
paint
,
*NL*
and
drawed
off
some
handbills
,
and
stuck
them
up
all
over
the
village
.
*NL*
The
bills
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*

Then
at

said

CHAPTER
XXIII
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
all
day
him
and
the
king
was
hard
at
it
,
rigging
up
a
stage
and
*NL*
a
curtain
and
a
row
of
candles
for
footlights
;
and
that
night
the
*NL*
house
was
jam
full
of
men
in
no
time
.
When
the
place
could
n't
hold
no
*NL*
more
,
the
duke
he
quit
tending
door
and
went
around
the
back
way
and
*NL*
come
onto
the
stage
and
stood
up
before
the
curtain
and
made
a
little
*NL*
speech
,
and
praised
up
this
tragedy
,
and
said
it
was
the
most
*NL*
thrillingest
one
that
ever
was
;
and
so
he
went
on
a-bragging
about
the
*NL*
tragedy
,
and
about
Edmund
Kean
the
Elder
,
which
was
to
play
the
main
*NL*
principal
part
in
it
;
and
at
last
when
he
'd
got
everybody
's
*NL*
expectations
up
high
enough
,
he
rolled
up
the
curtain
,
and
the
next
*NL*
minute
the
king
come
a-prancing
out
on
all
fours
,
naked
;
and
he
was
*NL*
painted
all
over
,
ring-streaked-and-striped
,
all
sorts
of
colors
,
as
*NL*
splendid
as
a
rainbow
.
And
--
but
never
mind
the
rest
of
his
outfit
;
it
*NL*
was
just
wild
,
but
it
was
awful
funny
.
The
people
most
killed
*NL*
themselves
laughing
;
and
when
the
king
got
done
capering
and
capered
*NL*
off
behind
the
scenes
,
they
roared
and
clapped
and
stormed
and
*NL*
haw-hawed
till
he
come
back
and
done
it
over
again
,
and
after
that
*NL*
they
made
him
do
it
another
time
.
Well
,
it
would
make
a
cow
laugh
to
*NL*
see
the
shines
that
old
idiot
cut
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
duke
he
lets
the
curtain
down
,
and
bows
to
the
people
,
and
*NL*
says
the
great
tragedy
will
be
performed
only
two
nights
more
,
on
*NL*
accounts
of
pressing
London
engagements
,
where
the
seats
is
all
sold
*NL*
already
for
it
in
Drury
Lane
;
and
then
he
makes
them
another
bow
,
and
*NL*
says
if
he
has
succeeded
in
pleasing
them
and
instructing
them
,
he
*NL*
will
be
deeply
obleeged
if
they
will
mention
it
to
their
friends
and
*NL*
get
them
to
come
and
see
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Twenty
people
sings
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
is
it
over
?
Is
that
_
all
_
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
duke
says
yes
.
Then
there
was
a
fine
time
.
Everybody
sings
out
,
*NL*
``
Sold
!
''
and
rose
up
mad
,
and
was
a-going
for
that
stage
and
them
*NL*
tragedians
.
But
a
big
,
fine-looking
man
jumps
up
on
a
bench
and
*NL*
shouts
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
on
!
Just
a
word
,
gentlemen
.
''
They
stopped
to
listen
.
``
We
are
*NL*
sold
--
mighty
badly
sold
.
But
we
do
n't
want
to
be
the
laughing-stock
of
*NL*
this
whole
town
,
I
reckon
,
and
never
hear
the
last
of
this
thing
as
*NL*
long
as
we
live
.
_
No
_
.
What
we
want
is
to
go
out
of
here
quiet
,
and
*NL*
talk
this
show
up
,
and
sell
the
_
rest
_
of
the
town
!
Then
we
'll
all
be
*NL*
in
the
same
boat
.
Ai
n't
that
sensible
?
''
-LRB-
``
You
bet
it
is
!
--
the
jedge
is
*NL*
right
!
''
everybody
sings
out
.
-RRB-
``
All
right
,
then
--
not
a
word
about
any
*NL*
sell
.
Go
along
home
,
and
advise
everybody
to
come
and
see
the
*NL*
tragedy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
you
could
n't
hear
nothing
around
that
town
but
how
splendid
*NL*
that
show
was
.
House
was
jammed
again
that
night
,
and
we
sold
this
*NL*
crowd
the
same
way
.
When
me
and
the
king
and
the
duke
got
home
to
the
*NL*
raft
we
all
had
a
supper
;
and
by
and
by
,
about
midnight
,
they
made
Jim
*NL*
and
me
back
her
out
and
float
her
down
the
middle
of
the
river
,
and
*NL*
fetch
her
in
and
hide
her
about
two
mile
below
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
third
night
the
house
was
crammed
again
--
and
they
war
n't
*NL*
new-comers
this
time
,
but
people
that
was
at
the
show
the
other
two
*NL*
nights
.
I
stood
by
the
duke
at
the
door
,
and
I
see
that
every
man
that
*NL*
went
in
had
his
pockets
bulging
,
or
something
muffled
up
under
his
*NL*
coat
--
and
I
see
it
war
n't
no
perfumery
,
neither
,
not
by
a
long
sight
.
*NL*
I
smelt
sickly
eggs
by
the
barrel
,
and
rotten
cabbages
,
and
such
*NL*
things
;
and
if
I
know
the
signs
of
a
dead
cat
being
around
,
and
I
bet
*NL*
I
do
,
there
was
sixty-four
of
them
went
in
.
I
shoved
in
there
for
a
*NL*
minute
,
but
it
was
too
various
for
me
;
I
could
n't
stand
it
.
Well
,
when
*NL*
the
place
could
n't
hold
no
more
people
the
duke
he
give
a
fellow
a
*NL*
quarter
and
told
him
to
tend
door
for
him
a
minute
,
and
then
he
*NL*
started
around
for
the
stage
door
,
I
after
him
;
but
the
minute
we
*NL*
turned
the
corner
and
was
in
the
dark
he
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Walk
fast
now
till
you
get
away
from
the
houses
,
and
then
shin
for
*NL*
the
raft
like
the
dickens
was
after
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
done
it
,
and
he
done
the
same
.
We
struck
the
raft
at
the
same
time
,
*NL*
and
in
less
than
two
seconds
we
was
gliding
down-stream
,
all
dark
and
*NL*
still
,
and
edging
towards
the
middle
of
the
river
,
nobody
saying
a
*NL*
word
.
I
reckoned
the
poor
king
was
in
for
a
gaudy
time
of
it
with
the
*NL*
audience
,
but
nothing
of
the
sort
;
pretty
soon
he
crawls
out
from
*NL*
under
the
wigwam
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
how
'd
the
old
thing
pan
out
this
time
,
duke
?
''
He
had
n't
been
*NL*
up-town
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
never
showed
a
light
till
we
was
about
ten
mile
below
the
village
.
*NL*
Then
we
lit
up
and
had
a
supper
,
and
the
king
and
the
duke
fairly
*NL*
laughed
their
bones
loose
over
the
way
they
'd
served
them
people
.
The
*NL*
duke
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Greenhorns
,
flatheads
!
I
knew
the
first
house
would
keep
mum
and
let
*NL*
the
rest
of
the
town
get
roped
in
;
and
I
knew
they
'd
lay
for
us
the
*NL*
third
night
,
and
consider
it
was
_
their
_
turn
now
.
Well
,
it
_
is
_
their
*NL*
turn
,
and
I
'd
give
something
to
know
how
much
they
'd
take
for
it
.
I
*NL*
_
would
_
just
like
to
know
how
they
're
putting
in
their
opportunity
.
*NL*
They
can
turn
it
into
a
picnic
if
they
want
to
--
they
brought
plenty
*NL*
provisions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Them
rapscallions
took
in
four
hundred
and
sixty-five
dollars
in
that
*NL*
three
nights
.
I
never
see
money
hauled
in
by
the
wagon-load
like
that
*NL*
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
and
by
,
when
they
was
asleep
and
snoring
,
Jim
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't

`

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*

*NL*
``
Is

so

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
read
about
them
once

you
'll
see

Look
at
Henry
the
Eight
;
this
*NL*
'n'
's
a
Sunday-school
Superintendent
to
_
him

And
look
at
Charles

,
and
Louis
Fourteen
,
and
Louis
Fifteen
,
and
James
Second
,
and
*NL*
Edward

Richard

and
forty
more
;
besides
all
them
*NL*
Saxon
heptarchies
that
used
to
rip
around
so
in
old
times
and
raise
*NL*
Cain
.
My
,
you
ought
to
seen
old
Henry
the
Eight
when
he
was
in
bloom
.
*NL*
He
_
was
_
a
blossom
.
He
used
to
marry
a
new
wife
every
day
,
and
chop
*NL*
off
her
head
next
morning
.
And
he
would
do
it
just
as
indifferent
as
*NL*
if
he
was
ordering
up
eggs
.
`
Fetch
up
Nell
Gwynn
,
'
he
says
.
They
fetch
*NL*
her
up

Next
morning
,
`
Chop
off
her
head
!

And
they
chop
it
off
.
*NL*
`
Fetch
up
Jane
Shore
,
'
he
says
;
and
up
she
comes
.
Next
morning
,
`
Chop
*NL*
off
her
head
'
--
and
they
chop
it
off
.
`
Ring
up
Fair
Rosamun
.
'
Fair
*NL*
Rosamun
answers
the
bell
.
Next
morning
,
`
Chop
off
her
head
.
'
And
he
*NL*
made
every
one
of
them
tell
him
a
tale
every
night
;
and
he
kept
that
*NL*
up
till
he
had
hogged
a
thousand
and
one
tales
that
way
,
and
then
he
*NL*
put
them
all
in
a
book
,
and
called
it
Domesday
Book
--
which
was
a
good
*NL*
name
and
stated
the
case
.
You
do
n't
know
kings
,
Jim
,
but
I
know
them
;
*NL*
and
this
old
rip
of
ourn
is
one
of
the
cleanest
I
've
struck
in
*NL*
history
.
Well
,
Henry
he
takes
a
notion
he
wants
to
get
up
some
trouble
*NL*
with
this
country
.
How
does
he
go
at
it
--
give
notice
?
--
give
the
*NL*
country
a
show
?
No
.
All
of
a
sudden
he
heaves
all
the
tea
in
Boston
*NL*
Harbor
overboard
,
and
whacks
out
a
declaration
of
independence
,
and
*NL*
dares
them
to
come
on
.
That
was
_
his
_
style
--
he
never
give
anybody
a
*NL*
chance
.
He
had
suspicions
of
his
father
,
the
Duke
of
Wellington
.
Well
,
*NL*
what
did
he
do
?
Ask
him
to
show
up
?
No
--
drownded
him
in
a
butt
of
*NL*
mamsey
,
like
a
cat
.
S'pose
people
left
money
laying
around
where
he
*NL*
was
--
what
did
he
do
?
He
collared
it
.
S'pose
he
contracted
to
do
a
*NL*
thing
,
and
you
paid
him
,
and
did
n't
set
down
there
and
see
that
he
*NL*
done
it
--
what
did
he
do
?
He
always
done
the
other
thing
.
S'pose
he
*NL*
opened
his
mouth
--
what
then
?
If
he
did
n't
shut
it
up
powerful
quick
*NL*
he
'd
lose
a
lie
every
time
.
That
's
the
kind
of
a
bug
Henry
was
;
and
if
*NL*
we
'd
`
a
'
had
him
along
`
stead
of
our
kings
he
'd
`
a
'
fooled
that
town
a
*NL*
heap
worse
than
ourn
done
.
I
do
n't
say
that
ourn
is
lambs
,
because
*NL*
they
ai
n't
,
when
you
come
right
down
to
the
cold
facts
;
but
they
ai
n't
*NL*
nothing
to
_
that
_
old
ram
,
anyway
.
All
I
say
is
,
kings
is
kings
,
and
*NL*
you
got
to
make
allowances
.
Take
them
all
around
,
they
're
a
mighty
*NL*
ornery
lot

It
's
the
way
they
're
raised

got

on

and
*NL*
we
got
to
remember
what
they
are
,
and
make
allowances

Sometimes
I
*NL*
wish
we
could
hear
of
a
country
that
's
out
of

''
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
the
use
to
tell
Jim
these
war
n't
real
kings
and
dukes
?
It
*NL*
would
n't
`
a
'
done
no
good
;
and
,
besides
,
it
was
just
as
I
said
:
you
*NL*
could
n't
tell
them
from
the
real
kind
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
to
sleep
,
and
Jim
did
n't
call
me
when
it
was
my
turn
.
He
often
*NL*
done
that
.
When
I
waked
up
just
at
daybreak
he
was
sitting
there
with
*NL*
his
head
down
betwixt
his
knees
,
moaning
and
mourning
to
himself
.
I
*NL*
did
n't
take
notice
nor
let
on
.
I
knowed
what
it
was
about
.
He
was
*NL*
thinking
about
his
wife
and
his
children
,
away
up
yonder
,
and
he
was
*NL*
low
and
homesick
;
because
he
had
n't
ever
been
away
from
home
before
in
*NL*
his
life
;
and
I
do
believe
he
cared
just
as
much
for
his
people
as
*NL*
white
folks
does
for
their
`
n
.
It
do
n't
seem
natural
,
but
I
reckon
it
's
*NL*
so
.
He
was
often
moaning
and
mourning
that
way
nights
,
when
he
judged
*NL*
I
was
asleep
,
and
saying
,
``
Po
'
little
`
Lizabeth

'
little

*NL*
it
's

hard

''
He
was
a
mighty
good
nigger
,
Jim
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
time
I
somehow
got
to
talking
to
him
about
his
wife
and
young
*NL*
ones
;
and
by
and

he
says

CHAPTER
XXIV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
,
towards
night
,
we
laid
up
under
a
little
willow
towhead
out
*NL*
in
the
middle
,
where
there
was
a
village
on
each
side
of
the
river
,
*NL*
and
the
duke
and
the
king
begun
to
lay
out
a
plan
for
working
them
*NL*
towns
.
Jim
he
spoke
to
the
duke
,
and
said
he
hoped
it
would
n't
take
*NL*
but
a
few
hours
,
because
it
got
mighty
heavy
and
tiresome
to
him
when
*NL*
he
had
to
lay
all
day
in
the
wigwam
tied
with
the
rope
.
You
see
,
when
*NL*
we
left
him
all
alone
we
had
to
tie
him
,
because
if
anybody
happened
*NL*
on
to
him
all
by
himself
and
not
tied
it
would
n't
look
much
like
he
*NL*
was
a
runaway
nigger
,
you
know
.
So
the
duke
said
it
_
was
_
kind
of
hard
*NL*
to
have
to
lay
roped
all
day
,
and
he
'd
cipher
out
some
way
to
get
*NL*
around
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
uncommon
bright
,
the
duke
was
,
and
he
soon
struck
it
.
He
*NL*
dressed
Jim
up
in
King
Lear
's
outfit
--
it
was
a
long
curtain-calico
*NL*
gown
,
and
a
white
horse-hair
wig
and
whiskers
;
and
then
he
took
his
*NL*
theater
paint
and
painted
Jim
's
face
and
hands
and
ears
and
neck
all
*NL*
over
a
dead
,
dull
solid
blue
,
like
a
man
that
's
been
drownded
nine
*NL*
days
.
Blamed
if
he
war
n't
the
horriblest-looking
outrage
I
ever
see
.
*NL*
Then
the
duke
took
and
wrote
out
a
sign
on
a
shingle
so
:
*NL*
*NL*
_
Sick
Arab
--
but
harmless
when
not
out
of
his
head
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
nailed
that
shingle
to
a
lath
,
and
stood
the
lath
up
four
or
*NL*
five
foot
in
front
of
the
wigwam
.
Jim
was
satisfied
.
He
said
it
was
a
*NL*
sight
better
than
lying
tied
a
couple
of
years
every
day
,
and
*NL*
trembling
all
over
every
time
there
was
a
sound
.
The
duke
told
him
to
*NL*
make
himself
free
and
easy
,
and
if
anybody
ever
come
meddling
around
,
*NL*
he
must
hop
out
of
the
wigwam
,
and
carry
on
a
little
,
and
fetch
a
howl
*NL*
or
two
like
a
wild
beast
,
and
he
reckoned
they
would
light
out
and
*NL*
leave
him
alone
.
Which
was
sound
enough
judgment
;
but
you
take
the
*NL*
average
man
,
and
he
would
n't
wait
for
him
to
howl
.
Why
,
he
did
n't
only
*NL*
look
like
he
was
dead
,
he
looked
considerable
more
than
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
rapscallions
wanted
to
try
the
Nonesuch
again
,
because
there
was
*NL*
so
much
money
in
it
,
but
they
judged
it
would
n't
be
safe
,
because
*NL*
maybe
the
news
might
`
a
'
worked
along
down
by
this
time
.
They
could
n't
*NL*
hit
no
project
that
suited
exactly
;
so
at
last
the
duke
said
he
*NL*
reckoned
he
'd
lay
off
and
work
his
brains
an
hour
or
two
and
see
if
he
*NL*
could
n't
put
up
something
on
the
Arkansaw
village
;
and
the
king
he
*NL*
allowed
he
would
drop
over
to
t
`
other
village
without
any
plan
,
but
*NL*
just
trust
in
Providence
to
lead
him
the
profitable
way
--
meaning
the
*NL*
devil
,
I
reckon
.
We
had
all
bought
store
clothes
where
we
stopped
*NL*
last
;
and
now
the
king
put
his
'n
on
,
and
he
told
me
to
put
mine
on
.
I
*NL*
done
it
,
of
course
.
The
king
's
duds
was
all
black
,
and
he
did
look
*NL*
real
swell
and
starchy
.
I
never
knowed
how
clothes
could
change
a
body
*NL*
before
.
Why
,
before
,
he
looked
like
the
orneriest
old
rip
that
ever
*NL*
was
;
but
now
,
when
he
'd
take
off
his
new
white
beaver
and
make
a
bow
*NL*
and
do
a
smile
,
he
looked
that
grand
and
good
and
pious
that
you
'd
say
*NL*
he
had
walked
right
out
of
the
ark
,
and
maybe
was
old
Leviticus
*NL*
himself
.
Jim
cleaned
up
the
canoe
,
and
I
got
my
paddle
ready
.
There
*NL*
was
a
big
steamboat
laying
at
the
shore
away
up
under
the
point
,
about
*NL*
three
mile
above
the
town
--
been
there
a
couple
of
hours
,
taking
on
*NL*
freight
.
Says
the
king
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Seein
'
how
I
'm
dressed
,
I
reckon
maybe
I
better
arrive
down
from
St.
*NL*
Louis
or
Cincinnati
,
or
some
other
big
place
.
Go
for
the
steamboat
,
*NL*
Huckleberry
;
we
'll
come
down
to
the
village
on
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
n't
have
to
be
ordered
twice
to
go
and
take
a
steamboat
ride
.
I
*NL*
fetched
the
shore
a
half
a
mile
above
the
village
,
and
then
went
*NL*
scooting
along
the
bluff
bank
in
the
easy
water
.
Pretty
soon
we
come
*NL*
to
a
nice
innocent-looking
young
country
jake
setting
on
a
log
*NL*
swabbing
the
sweat
off
of
his
face
,
for
it
was
powerful
warm
weather
;
*NL*
and
he
had
a
couple
of
big
carpet-bags
by
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Run
her
nose
inshore
,
''
says
the
king
.
I
done
it
.
``
Wher
'
you
bound
*NL*
for
,
young
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
the
steamboat
;
going
to
Orleans
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Git
aboard
,
''
says
the
king
.
``
Hold
on
a
minute

my

Jump

*NL*
Adolphus
''
--
meaning
me
,
I
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
done
so
,
and
then
we
all
three
started
on
again
.
The
young
chap
was
*NL*
mighty
thankful
;
said
it
was
tough
work
toting
his
baggage
such
*NL*
weather
.
He
asked
the
king
where
he
was
going
,
and
the
king
told
him
*NL*
he
'd
come
down
the
river
and
landed
at
the
other
village
this
morning
,
*NL*
and
now
he
was
going
up
a
few
mile
to
see
an
old
friend
on
a
farm
up
*NL*
there
.
The
young
fellow
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
first
see
you
I
says
to
myself
,
`
It
's
Mr.
Wilks

sure
,
and
he
*NL*
come
mighty
near
getting
here
in
time

'
But
then
I
says
again
,
`
No
,
I
*NL*
reckon
it
ai
n't
him
,
or
else
he
would
n't
be
paddling
up

river

*NL*
*NL*
``

But
still
I
'm
jist
as

be

for

for
not
arriving
*NL*
in

,
all
the

he
's

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
he
do
n't
miss
any
property
by
it

because
he
'll
get
that
all
*NL*
right
;
but
he
's
missed
seeing
his
brother
Peter
die
--
which
he
may
n't
*NL*
mind
,
nobody
can
tell
as
to
that

his
brother
would
`

give
*NL*
anything
in
this
world
to
see
_
him
_
before
he
died

never
talked
about
*NL*
nothing
else
all
these
three
weeks
;
had
n't
seen
him

they

together

had

his

dumb
one

more
than
thirty

thirty-five

Peter

George
was

died

Harvey

's
left
now

as
I
was
saying
,
they

have
n't
got
here
in
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
anybody
send
'em
word

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
;
a
month
or
two
ago
,
when
Peter
was
first
took
;
because
Peter
*NL*
said
then
that
he
sorter
felt
like
he
war
n't
going
to
get
well
this
*NL*
time
.
You
see
,
he
was
pretty
old
,
and
George
's

`
yirls
was
too
young
*NL*
to
be
much
company
for
him
,
except
Mary
Jane
,
the
red-headed
one
;
and
*NL*
so
he
was
kinder
lonesome
after
George
and
his
wife
died
,
and
did
n't
*NL*
seem
to
care
much
to
live

He
most
desperately
wanted
to
see
*NL*
Harvey

and
William

too

for
that
matter

because
he
was
one
of
them
*NL*
kind
that
ca
n't
bear
to
make
a
will

He
left
a
letter
behind
for
*NL*
Harvey

said
he
'd
told
in
it
where
his
money
was
hid

how
he
*NL*
wanted
the
rest
of
the
property
divided
up
so
George
's
g

would
*NL*
be
all
right

for
George
did
n't
leave
nothing

with

used

when

wrote
home

so

'll
know
where
to
look
for
friends

''
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
the
old
man
went
on
asking
questions
till
he
just
fairly
emptied
*NL*
that
young
fellow
.
Blamed
if
he
did
n't
inquire
about
everybody
and
*NL*
everything
in
that
blessed
town
,
and
all
about
the
Wilkses
;
and
about
*NL*
Peter
's
business
--
which
was
a
tanner
;
and
about
George
's
--
which
was
a
*NL*
carpenter
;
and
about
Harvey
's
--
which
was
a
dissentering
minister
;
and
*NL*
so
on
,
and
so
on
.
Then
he
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
you
want

all
the
way
up

*NL*
*NL*
``

's
all

one

another

So
what
we
want

then
we

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
When
we
struck
the
boat
she
was
about
done
loading
,
and
pretty
soon
*NL*
she
got
off
.
The
king
never
said
nothing
about
going
aboard
,
so
I
lost
*NL*
my
ride
,
after
all
.
When
the
boat
was
gone
the
king
made
me
paddle
up
*NL*
another
mile
to
a
lonesome
place
,
and
then
he
got
ashore
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
hustle
back
,
right
off
,
and
fetch
the
duke
up
here
,
and
the
new
*NL*
carpet-bags
.
And
if
he
's
gone
over
to
t
`
other
side
,
go
over
there
and
*NL*
git
him
.
And
tell
him
to
git
himself
up
regardless
.
Shove
along
,
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
see
what
_
he
_
was
up
to
;
but
I
never
said
nothing
,
of
course
.
When
I
*NL*
got
back
with
the
duke
we
hid
the
canoe
,
and
then
they
set
down
on
a
*NL*
log
,
and
the
king
told
him
everything
,
just
like
the
young
fellow
had
*NL*
said
it
--
every
last
word
of
it
.
And
all
the
time
he
was
a-doing
it
he
*NL*
tried
to
talk
like
an
Englishman
;
and
he
done
it
pretty
well
,
too
,
for
*NL*
a
slouch
.
I
ca
n't
imitate
him
,
and
so
I
ai
n't
a-going
to
try
to
;
but
*NL*
he
really
done
it
pretty
good
.
Then
he
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
are
you
on
the
deef
and
dumb
,
Bilgewater
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
duke
said
,
leave
him
alone
for
that
;
said
he
had
played
a
deef
and
*NL*
dumb
person
on
the
histrionic
boards
.
So
then
they
waited
for
a
*NL*
steamboat
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
a
couple
of
little
boats
come
along
,
*NL*
but
they
did
n't
come
from
high
enough
up
the
river
;
but
at
last
there
*NL*
was
a
big
one
,
and
they
hailed
her
.
She
sent
out
her
yawl
,
and
we
went
*NL*
aboard
,
and
she
was
from
Cincinnati
;
and
when
they
found
we
only
*NL*
wanted
to
go
four
or
five
mile
they
was
booming
mad
,
and
gave
us
a
*NL*
cussing
,
and
said
they
would
n't
land
us
.
But
the
king
was
ca
'm
.
He
*NL*
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
gentlemen
kin
afford
to
pay
a
dollar
a
mile
apiece
to
be
took
on
*NL*
and
put
off
in
a
yawl
,
a
steamboat
kin
afford
to
carry
'em
,
ca
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
they
softened
down
and
said
it
was
all
right
;
and
when
we
got
to
*NL*
the
village
they
yawled
us
ashore
.
About
two
dozen
men
flocked
down
*NL*
when
they
see
the
yawl
a-coming
,
and
when
the
king
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kin
any
of
you
gentlemen
tell
me
wher
'
Mr.
Peter
Wilks
lives
?
''
they
*NL*
give
a
glance
at
one
another
,
and
nodded
their
heads
,
as
much
as
to
*NL*
say
,
``
What
'd
I
tell
you
?
''
Then
one
of
them
says
,
kind
of
soft
and
*NL*
gentle
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sorry
,
sir
,
but
the
best
we
can
do
is
to
tell
you
where
he
_
did
_
*NL*
live
yesterday
evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sudden
as
winking
the
ornery
old
cretur
went
all
to
smash
,
and
fell
up
*NL*
against
the
man
,
and
put
his
chin
on
his
shoulder
,
and
cried
down
his
*NL*
back
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
,
alas
,
our
poor
brother
--
gone
,
and
we
never
got
to
see
him
;
oh
,
*NL*
it
's
too
,
too
hard
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
turns
around
,
blubbering
,
and
makes
a
lot
of
idiotic
signs
to
*NL*
the
duke
on
his
hands
,
and
blamed
if
he
did
n't
drop
a
carpet-bag
and
*NL*
bust
out
a-crying
.
If
they
war
n't
the
beatenest
lot
,
them
two
frauds
,
*NL*
that
ever
I
struck
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
the
men
gathered
around
and
sympathized
with
them
,
and
said
all
*NL*
sorts
of
kind
things
to
them
,
and
carried
their
carpet-bags
up
the
*NL*
hill
for
them
,
and
let
them
lean
on
them
and
cry
,
and
told
the
king
*NL*
all
about
his
brother
's
last
moments
,
and
the
king
he
told
it
all
over
*NL*
again
on
his
hands
to
the
duke
,
and
both
of
them
took
on
about
that
*NL*
dead
tanner
like
they
'd
lost
the
twelve
disciples
.
Well
,
if
ever
I
*NL*
struck
anything
like
it
,
I
'm
a
nigger
.
It
was
enough
to
make
a
body
*NL*
ashamed
of
the
human
race
.

CHAPTER
XXV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
news
was
all
over
town
in
two
minutes
,
and
you
could
see
the
*NL*
people
tearing
down
on
the
run
from
every
which
way
,
some
of
them
*NL*
putting
on
their
coats
as
they
come
.
Pretty
soon
we
was
in
the
middle
*NL*
of
a
crowd
,
and
the
noise
of
the
tramping
was
like
a
soldier
march
.
*NL*
The
windows
and
dooryards
was
full
;
and
every
minute
somebody
would
*NL*
say
,
over
a
fence
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
_
them
?
_
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
somebody
trotting
along
with
the
gang
would
answer
back
and
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
bet
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
got
to
the
house
the
street
in
front
of
it
was
packed
,
and
the
*NL*
three
girls
was
standing
in
the
door
.
Mary
Jane
_
was
_
red-headed
,
but
*NL*
that
do
n't
make
no
difference
,
she
was
most
awful
beautiful
,
and
her
*NL*
face
and
her
eyes
was
all
lit
up
like
glory
,
she
was
so
glad
her
*NL*
uncles
was
come
.
The
king
he
spread
his
arms
,
and
Mary
Jane
she
jumped
*NL*
for
them
,
and
the
hare-lip
jumped
for
the
duke
,
and
there
they
_
had
_
*NL*
it
!
Everybody
most
,
leastways
women
,
cried
for
joy
to
see
them
meet
*NL*
again
at
last
and
have
such
good
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
king
he
hunched
the
duke
private
--
I
see
him
do
it
--
and
then
*NL*
he
looked
around
and
see
the
coffin
,
over
in
the
corner
on
two
chairs
;
*NL*
so
then
him
and
the
duke
,
with
a
hand
across
each
other
's
shoulder
,
*NL*
and
t
`
other
hand
to
their
eyes
,
walked
slow
and
solemn
over
there
,
*NL*
everybody
dropping
back
to
give
them
room
,
and
all
the
talk
and
noise
*NL*
stopping
,
people
saying
''
`
Sh
!
''
and
all
the
men
taking
their
hats
off
*NL*
and
drooping
their
heads
,
so
you
could
`
a
'
heard
a
pin
fall
.
And
when
*NL*
they
got
there
they
bent
over
and
looked
in
the
coffin
,
and
took
one
*NL*
sight
,
and
then
they
bust
out
a-crying
so
you
could
`
a
'
heard
them
to
*NL*
Orleans
,
most
;
and
then
they
put
their
arms
around
each
other
's
necks
,
*NL*
and
hung
their
chins
over
each
other
's
shoulders
;
and
then
for
three
*NL*
minutes
,
or
maybe
four
,
I
never
see
two
men
leak
the
way
they
done
.
*NL*
And
,
mind
you
,
everybody
was
doing
the
same
;
and
the
place
was
that
*NL*
damp
I
never
see
anything
like
it
.
Then
one
of
them
got
on
one
side
of
*NL*
the
coffin
,
and
t
`
other
on
t
`
other
side
,
and
they
kneeled
down
and
*NL*
rested
their
foreheads
on
the
coffin
,
and
let
on
to
pray
all
to
*NL*
themselves
.
Well
,
when
it
come
to
that
it
worked
the
crowd
like
you
*NL*
never
see
anything
like
it
,
and
everybody
broke
down
and
went
to
*NL*
sobbing
right
out
loud
--
the
poor
girls
,
too
;
and
every
woman
,
nearly
,
*NL*
went
up
to
the
girls
,
without
saying
a
word
,
and
kissed
them
,
solemn
,
*NL*
on
the
forehead
,
and
then
put
their
hand
on
their
head
,
and
looked
up
*NL*
towards
the
sky
,
with
the
tears
running
down
,
and
then
busted
out
and
*NL*
went
off
sobbing
and
swabbing
,
and
give
the
next
woman
a
show
.
I
never
*NL*
see
anything
so
disgusting
.
Well
,
by
and
by
the
king
he
gets
up
and
*NL*
comes
forward
a
little
,
and
works
himself
up
and
slobbers
out
a
*NL*
speech
,
all
full
of
tears
and
flapdoodle
,
about
its
being
a
sore
trial
*NL*
for
him
and
his
poor
brother
to
lose
the
diseased
,
and
to
miss
seeing
*NL*
diseased
alive
after
the
long
journey
of
four
thousand
mile
,
but
it
's
*NL*
a
trial
that
's
sweetened
and
sanctified
to
us
by
this
dear
sympathy
*NL*
and
these
holy
tears
,
and
so
he
thanks
them
out
of
his
heart
and
out
*NL*
of
his
brother
's
heart
,
because
out
of
their
mouths
they
ca
n't
,
words
*NL*
being
too
weak
and
cold
,
and
all
that
kind
of
rot
and
slush
,
till
it
*NL*
was
just
sickening
;
and
then
he
blubbers
out
a
pious
goody-goody
Amen
,
*NL*
and
turns
himself
loose
and
goes
to
crying
fit
to
bust
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
minute
the
words
were
out
of
his
mouth
somebody
over
in
the
*NL*
crowd
struck
up
the
doxolojer
,
and
everybody
joined
in
with
all
their
*NL*
might
,
and
it
just
warmed
you
up
and
made
you
feel
as
good
as
church
*NL*
letting
out
.
Music
is
a
good
thing
;
and
after
all
that
soul-butter
and
*NL*
hogwash
I
never
see
it
freshen
up
things
so
,
and
sound
so
honest
and
*NL*
bully
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
king
begins
to
work
his
jaw
again
,
and
says
how
him
and
his
*NL*
nieces
would
be
glad
if
a
few
of
the
main
principal
friends
of
the
*NL*
family
would
take
supper
here
with
them
this
evening
,
and
help
set
up
*NL*
with
the
ashes
of
the
diseased
;
and
says
if
his
poor
brother
laying
*NL*
yonder
could
speak
he
knows
who
he
would
name
,
for
they
was
names
that
*NL*
was
very
dear
to
him
,
and
mentioned
often
in
his
letters
;
and
so
he
*NL*
will
name
the
same
,
to
wit
,
as
follows
,
viz.
:
--
Rev.
Mr.
Hobson
,
and
*NL*
Deacon
Lot
Hovey
,
and
Mr.
Ben
Rucker
,
and
Abner
Shackleford
,
and
Levi
*NL*
Bell
,
and
Dr.
Robinson
,
and
their
wives
,
and
the
widow
Bartley
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rev.
Hobson
and
Dr.
Robinson
was
down
to
the
end
of
the
town
a-hunting
*NL*
together
--
that
is
,
I
mean
the
doctor
was
shipping
a
sick
man
to
*NL*
t
`
other
world
,
and
the
preacher
was
pinting
him
right
.
Lawyer
Bell
was
*NL*
away
up
to
Louisville
on
business
.
But
the
rest
was
on
hand
,
and
so
*NL*
they
all
come
and
shook
hands
with
the
king
and
thanked
him
and
talked
*NL*
to
him
;
and
then
they
shook
hands
with
the
duke
and
did
n't
say
*NL*
nothing
,
but
just
kept
a-smiling
and
bobbing
their
heads
like
a
passel
*NL*
of
sapheads
whilst
he
made
all
sorts
of
signs
with
his
hands
and
said
*NL*
``
Goo-goo
--
goo-goo-goo
''
all
the
time
,
like
a
baby
that
ca
n't
talk
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
king
he
blattered
along
,
and
managed
to
inquire
about
pretty
*NL*
much
everybody
and
dog
in
town
,
by
his
name
,
and
mentioned
all
sorts
*NL*
of
little
things
that
happened
one
time
or
another
in
the
town
,
or
to
*NL*
George
's
family
,
or
to
Peter
.
And
he
always
let
on
that
Peter
wrote
*NL*
him
the
things
;
but
that
was
a
lie
:
he
got
every
blessed
one
of
them
*NL*
out
of
that
young
flathead
that
we
canoed
up
to
the
steamboat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Mary
Jane
she
fetched
the
letter
her
father
left
behind
,
and
the
*NL*
king
he
read
it
out
loud
and
cried
over
it
.
It
give
the
dwelling-house
*NL*
and
three
thousand
dollars
,
gold
,
to
the
girls
;
and
it
give
the
*NL*
tanyard
-LRB-
which
was
doing
a
good
business
-RRB-
,
along
with
some
other
*NL*
houses
and
land
-LRB-
worth
about
seven
thousand
-RRB-
,
and
three
thousand
*NL*
dollars
in
gold
to
Harvey
and
William
,
and
told
where
the
six
thousand
*NL*
cash
was
hid
down
cellar
.
So
these
two
frauds
said
they
'd
go
and
fetch
*NL*
it
up
,
and
have
everything
square
and
above-board
;
and
told
me
to
come
*NL*
with
a
candle
.
We
shut
the
cellar
door
behind
us
,
and
when
they
found
*NL*
the
bag
they
spilt
it
out
on
the
floor
,
and
it
was
a
lovely
sight
,
all
*NL*
them
yaller-boys
.
My
,
the
way
the
king
's
eyes
did
shine
!
He
slaps
the
*NL*
duke
on
the
shoulder
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
_
this
_
ai
n't
bully
nor
noth
`
n
!
Oh
,
no
,
I
reckon
not
!
Why
,
Biljy
,
*NL*
it
beats
the
Nonesuch
,
_
do
n't
_
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
duke
allowed
it
did
.
They
pawed
the
yaller-boys
,
and
sifted
them
*NL*
through
their
fingers
and
let
them
jingle
down
on
the
floor
;
and
the
*NL*
king
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
ai
n't
no
use
talkin
'
;
bein
'
brothers
to
a
rich
dead
man
and
*NL*
representatives
of
furrin
heirs
that
's
got
left
is
the
line
for
you
*NL*
and
me
,
Bilge
.
Thish
yer
comes
of
trust
'n
to
Providence
.
It
's
the
best
*NL*
way
,
in
the
long
run
.
I
've
tried
'em
all
,
and
ther
'
ai
n't
no
better
*NL*
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Most
everybody
would
`
a
'
been
satisfied
with
the
pile
,
and
took
it
on
*NL*
trust
;
but
no
,
they
must
count
it
.
So
they
counts
it
,
and
it
comes
out
*NL*
four
hundred
and
fifteen
dollars
short
.
Says
the
king
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dern
him
,
I
wonder
what
he
done
with
that
four
hundred
and
fifteen
*NL*
dollars
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
worried
over
that
awhile
,
and
ransacked
all
around
for
it
.
Then
*NL*
the
duke
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
he
was
a
pretty
sick
man
,
and
likely
he
made
a
mistake
--
I
*NL*
reckon
that
's
the
way
of
it
.
The
best
way
's
to
let
it
go
,
and
keep
*NL*
still
about
it
.
We
can
spare
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
shucks
,
yes
,
we
can
_
spare
_
it
.
I
do
n't
k

*NL*
that

it
's
the

We
want
to

We

up-stairs

But
when
the
dead

you

we
do
n't

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
on

''
says
the
duke
.
``
Le
's
make
up
the
deffisit

''
and
he
begun
to
*NL*
haul
out
yaller-boys
out
of
his
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

_
he
_
begun
to
haul
out
yaller-jackets
and
*NL*
stack
them
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
most
busted
them
,
but
they
made
up
the
six
thousand
clean
and
*NL*
clear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say

says
the
duke
,
``
I

Let

out

''
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
got
up-stairs
everybody
gethered
around
the
table
,
and
the
*NL*
king
he
counted
it
and
stacked
it
up
,
three
hundred
dollars
in
a
*NL*
pile
--
twenty
elegant
little
piles
.
Everybody
looked
hungry
at
it
,
and
*NL*
licked
their
chops
.
Then
they
raked
it
into
the
bag
again
,
and
I
see
*NL*
the
king
begin
to
swell
himself
up
for
another
speech
.
He
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Friends
all
,
my
poor
brother
that
lays
yonder
has
done
generous
by

them

He
has
done
generous
*NL*
by
these
yer
poor
little
lambs
that
he
loved
and
sheltered
,
and
that
's
*NL*
left
fatherless

Yes
,
and
we
that
knowed
him
knows
that
*NL*
he
would
`
a
'
done
_
more
_
generous
by
'em
if
he
had
n't
ben
afeard
o
'
*NL*
woundin
'
his
dear
William
and
me
.
Now
,
_
would

_
he
?
Ther
'
ai
n't
no
*NL*
question
`
bout
it
in
_
my
_
mind
.
Well
,
then
,
what
kind
o
'
brothers
*NL*
would
it
be
that
'd
stand
in
his
way
at
sech
a
time
?
And
what
kind
o
'
*NL*
uncles
would
it
be
that
'd
rob
--
yes
,
_
Rob
_
--
sech
poor
sweet
lambs
as
*NL*
these
`
at
he
loved
so
at
sech
a
time
?
If
I
know
William
--
and
I
_
think
_
*NL*
I
do
--
he
--
well
,
I
'll
jest
ask
him
.
''
He
turns
around
and
begins
to
make
*NL*
a
lot
of
signs
to
the
duke
with
his
hands
,
and
the
duke
he
looks
at
*NL*
him
stupid
and
leather-headed
awhile
;
then
all
of
a
sudden
he
seems
to
*NL*
catch
his
meaning
,
and
jumps
for
the
king
,
goo-gooing
with
all
his
*NL*
might
for
joy
,
and
hugs
him
about
fifteen
times
before
he
lets
up
.
*NL*
Then
the
king
says
,
``
I
knowed
it
;
I
reckon
_
that
_
'll
convince
anybody
*NL*
the
way
_
he
_
feels
about
it
.
Here
,
Mary
Jane
,
Susan
,
Joanner
,
take
the
*NL*
money
--
take
it
_
all
.
_
It
's
the
gift
of
him
that
lays
yonder
,
cold
but
*NL*
joyful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
Jane
she
went
for
him
,
Susan
and
the
hare-lip
went
for
the
duke
,
*NL*
and
then
such
another
hugging
and
kissing
I
never
see
yet
.
And
*NL*
everybody
crowded
up
with
the
tears
in
their
eyes
,
and
most
shook
the
*NL*
hands
off
of
them
frauds
,
saying
all
the
time
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
_
dear
_
good
souls
!
--
how
_
lovely
!
_
--
how
_
could
_
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
then
,
pretty
soon
all
hands
got
to
talking
about
the
diseased
*NL*
again
,
and
how
good
he
was
,
and
what
a
loss
he
was
,
and
all
that
;
and
*NL*
before
long
a
big
iron-jawed
man
worked
himself
in
there
from
outside
,
*NL*
and
stood
a-listening
and
looking
,
and
not
saying
anything
;
and
nobody
*NL*
saying
anything
to
him
either
,
because
the
king
was
talking
and
they
*NL*
was
all
busy
listening
.
The
king
was
saying
--
in
the
middle
of
*NL*
something
he
'd
started
in
on
--
*NL*
*NL*
''
--
they
bein
'
partickler
friends
o
'
the
diseased
.
That
's
why
they
're
*NL*
invited
here
this
evenin
'
;
but
tomorrow
we
want
_
all
_
to
*NL*
come
--
everybody
;
for
he
respected
everybody
,
he
liked
everybody
,
and
*NL*
so
it
's
fitten
that
his
funeral
orgies
sh
'd
be
public
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
he
went
a-mooning
on
and
on
,
liking
to
hear
himself
talk
,
and
*NL*
every
little
while
he
fetched
in
his
funeral
orgies
again
,
till
the
*NL*
duke
he
could
n't
stand
it
no
more
;
so
he
writes
on
a
little
scrap
of
*NL*
paper
,
''
_
Obsequies
_
,
you
old
fool
,
''
and
folds
it
up
,
and
goes
to
*NL*
goo-gooing
and
reaching
it
over
people
's
heads
to
him
.
The
king
he
*NL*
reads
it
and
puts
it
in
his
pocket
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
William
,
afflicted
as
he
is
,
his
_
heart
's
_
aluz
right
.
Asks
me
*NL*
to
invite
everybody
to
come
to
the
funeral
--
wants
me
to
make
'em
all
*NL*
welcome
.
But
he
need
n't
`
a
'
worried
--
it
was
jest
what
I
was
at
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
weaves
along
again
,
perfectly
ca
'm
,
and
goes
to
dropping
in
*NL*
his
funeral
orgies
again
every
now
and
then
,
just
like
he
done
before
.
*NL*
And
when
he
done
it
the
third
time
he
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
orgies
,
not
because
it
's
the
common
term
,
because
it
*NL*
ai
n't
--
obsequies
bein
'
the
common
term
--
but
because
orgies
is
the
*NL*
right
term
.
Obsequies
ai
n't
used
in
England
no
more
now
--
it
's
gone
*NL*
out
.
We
say
orgies
now
in
England
.
Orgies
is
better
,
because
it
means
*NL*
the
thing
you
're
after
more
exact
.
It
's
a
word
that
's
made
up
out
'n
*NL*
the
Greek
_
orgo
_
,
outside
,
open
,
abroad
;
and
the
Hebrew
_
jeesum
_
,
to
*NL*
plant
,
cover
up
;
hence
in_ter
_
.
So
,
you
see
,
funeral
orgies
is
an
open
*NL*
er
public
funeral
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
the
_
worst
_
I
ever
struck
.
Well
,
the
iron-jawed
man
he
laughed
*NL*
right
in
his
face
.
Everybody
was
shocked
.
Everybody
says
,
``
Why
,
*NL*
_
doctor
!
_
''
and
Abner
Shackleford
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Robinson
,
hai
n't
you
heard
the
news
?
This
is
Harvey
Wilks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
king
he
smiled
eager
,
and
shoved
out
his
flapper
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Is
_
it
my
poor
brother
's
dear
good
friend
and
physician
?
I
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Keep
your
hands
off
me
!
''
says
the
doctor
.
''
_
You
_
talk
like
an
*NL*
Englishman
,
_
do
n't
_
you
?
It
's
the
worst
imitation
I
ever
heard
.
_
You
_
*NL*
Peter
Wilks
's
brother
!
You
're
a
fraud
,
that
's
what
you
are
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
how
they
all
took
on
!
They
crowded
around
the
doctor
and
tried
*NL*
to
quiet
him
down
,
and
tried
to
explain
to
him
and
tell
him
how
*NL*
Harvey
's
showed
in
forty
ways
that
he
_
was
_
Harvey
,
and
knowed
*NL*
everybody
by
name
,
and
the
names
of
the
very
dogs
,
and
begged
and
*NL*
_
begged
_
him
not
to
hurt
Harvey
's
feelings
and
the
poor
girls
'
*NL*
feelings
,
and
all
that
.
But
it
war
n't
no
use
;
he
stormed
right
along
,
*NL*
and
said
any
man
that
pretended
to
be
an
Englishman
and
could
n't
*NL*
imitate
the
lingo
no
better
than
what
he
did
was
a
fraud
and
a
liar
.
*NL*
The
poor
girls
was
hanging
to
the
king
and
crying
;
and
all
of
a
sudden
*NL*
the
doctor
ups
and
turns
on
_
them
.
_
He
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
your
father
's
friend
,
and
I
'm
your
friend
;
and
I
warn
you
as
a
*NL*
friend
,
and
an
honest
one
that
wants
to
protect
you
and
keep
you
out
*NL*
of
harm
and
trouble
,
to
turn
your
backs
on
that
scoundrel
and
have
*NL*
nothing
to
do
with
him
,
the
ignorant
tramp
,
with
his
idiotic
Greek
and
*NL*
Hebrew
,
as
he
calls
it
.
He
is
the
thinnest
kind
of
an
impostor
--
has
*NL*
come
here
with
a
lot
of
empty
names
and
facts
which
he
picked
up
*NL*
somewheres
;
and
you
take
them
for
_
proofs
_
,
and
are
helped
to
fool
*NL*
yourselves
by
these
foolish
friends
here
,
who
ought
to
know
better
.
*NL*
Mary
Jane
Wilks
,
you
know
me
for
your
friend
,
and
for
your
unselfish
*NL*
friend
,
too
.
Now
listen
to
me
;
turn
this
pitiful
rascal
out
--
I
_
beg
_
*NL*
you
to
do
it
.
Will
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
Jane
straightened
herself
up
,
and
my
,
but
she
was
handsome
!
She
*NL*
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Here
_
is
my
answer
.
''
She
hove
up
the
bag
of
money
and
put
it
in
the
*NL*
king
's
hands
,
and
says
,
``
Take
this
six
thousand
dollars
,
and
invest
*NL*
for
me
and
my
sisters
any
way
you
want
to
,
and
do
n't
give
us
no
*NL*
receipt
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
put
her
arm
around
the
king
on
one
side
,
and
Susan
and
the
*NL*
hare-lip
done
the
same
on
the
other
.
Everybody
clapped
their
hands
and
*NL*
stomped
on
the
floor
like
a
perfect
storm
,
whilst
the
king
held
up
his
*NL*
head
and
smiled
proud
.
The
doctor
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
;
I
wash
_
my
_
hands
of
the
matter
.
But
I
warn
you
all
that
a
*NL*
time
's
coming
when
you
're
going
to
feel
sick
whenever
you
think
of
*NL*
this
day
.
''
And
away
he
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
doctor
,
''
says
the
king
,
kinder
mocking
him
;
``
we
'll
try
and
*NL*
get
'em
to
send
for
you
;
''
which
made
them
all
laugh
,
and
they
said
it
*NL*
was
a
prime
good
hit
.

*NL*
CHAPTER
XXVI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
when
they
was
all
gone
the
king
he
asks
Mary
Jane
how
they
was
*NL*
off
for
spare
rooms
,
and
she
said
she
had
one
spare
room
,
which
would
*NL*
do
for
Uncle
William
,
and
she
'd
give
her
own
room
to
Uncle
Harvey
,
*NL*
which
was
a
little
bigger
,
and
she
would
turn
into
the
room
with
her
*NL*
sisters
and
sleep
on
a
cot
;
and
up
garret
was
a
little
cubby
,
with
a
*NL*
pallet
in
it
.
The
king
said
the
cubby
would
do
for
his
valley
--
meaning
*NL*
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
Mary
Jane
took
us
up
,
and
she
showed
them
their
rooms
,
which
was
*NL*
plain
but
nice
.
She
said
she
'd
have
her
frocks
and
a
lot
of
other
*NL*
traps
took
out
of
her
room
if
they
was
in
Uncle
Harvey
's
way
,
but
he
*NL*
said
they
war
n't
.
The
frocks
was
hung
along
the
wall
,
and
before
them
*NL*
was
a
curtain
made
out
of
calico
that
hung
down
to
the
floor
.
There
*NL*
was
an
old
hair
trunk
in
one
corner
,
and
a
guitar-box
in
another
,
and
*NL*
all
sorts
of
little
knickknacks
and
jimcracks
around
,
like
girls
*NL*
brisken
up
a
room
with
.
The
king
said
it
was
all
the
more
homely
and
*NL*
more
pleasanter
for
these
fixings
,
and
so
do
n't
disturb
them
.
The
*NL*
duke
's
room
was
pretty
small
,
but
plenty
good
enough
,
and
so
was
my
*NL*
cubby
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
night
they
had
a
big
supper
,
and
all
them
men
and
women
was
*NL*
there
,
and
I
stood
behind
the
king
and
the
duke
's
chairs
and
waited
on
*NL*
them
,
and
the
niggers
waited
on
the
rest
.
Mary
Jane
she
set
at
the
*NL*
head
of
the
table
,
with
Susan
alongside
of
her
,
and
said
how
bad
the
*NL*
biscuits
was
,
and
how
mean
the
preserves
was
,
and
how
ornery
and
tough
*NL*
the
fried
chickens
was
--
and
all
that
kind
of
rot
,
the
way
women
always
*NL*
do
for
to
force
out
compliments
;
and
the
people
all
knowed
everything
*NL*
was
tiptop
,
and
said
so
--
said
``
How
_
do
_
you
get
biscuits
to
brown
so
*NL*
nice
?
''
and
``
Where
,
for
the
land
's
sake
,
_
did
_
you
get
these
amaz
'n
*NL*
pickles
?
''
and
all
that
kind
of
humbug
talky-talk
,
just
the
way
people
*NL*
always
does
at
a
supper
,
you
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
when
it
was
all
done
me
and
the
hare-lip
had
supper
in
the
kitchen
*NL*
off
of
the
leavings
,
whilst
the
others
was
helping
the
niggers
clean
*NL*
up
the
things
.
The
hare-lip
she
got
to
pumping
me
about
England
,
and
*NL*
blest
if
I
did
n't
think
the
ice
was
getting
mighty
thin
sometimes
.
She
*NL*
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
ever
see
the
king
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
?
William
Fourth
?
Well
,
I
bet
I
have
--
he
goes
to
our
church
.
''
I
*NL*
knowed
he
was
dead
years
ago
,
but
I
never
let
on
.
So
when
I
says
he
*NL*
goes
to
our
church
,
she
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
--
regular
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
regular
.
His
pew
's
right
over
opposite
ourn
--
on
t
`
other
side
the
*NL*
pulpit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
he
lived
in
London
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
he
does
.
Where
_
would
_
he
live
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
thought
_
you
_
lived
in
Sheffield
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
see
I
was
up
a
stump
.
I
had
to
let
on
to
get
choked
with
a
*NL*
chicken-bone
,
so
as
to
get
time
to
think
how
to
get
down
again
.
Then
I
*NL*
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
he
goes
to
our
church
regular
when
he
's
in
Sheffield

That
's
*NL*
only
in
the
summer-time
,
when
he
comes
there
to
take
the
sea
baths

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

talk

*NL*
*NL*
``

``

``

*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
I
was
gone
up
again

I
forgot
I
was
the
old
man
's
servant

But
*NL*
next
minute
I
whirled
in
on
a
kind
of
an
explanation
how
a
valley
was
*NL*
different
from
a
common
servant
,
and
_
had
_
to
go
to
church
whether
he
*NL*
wanted
to
or
not
,
and
set
with
the
family
,
on
account
of
its
being
the
*NL*
law
.
But
I
did
n't
do
it
pretty
good
,
and
when
I
got
done
I
see
she
*NL*
war
n't
satisfied

She
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
I

it
war
n't
nothing
but
a
dictionary

so
I
laid
my
hand
on
it

*NL*
said
it
.
So
then
she
looked
a
little
better
satisfied
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

*NL*

I

he

it
was

good
of

it

you

*NL*
``

n't
make

*NL*
thing
is
for

treat

not
be

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
says
to
myself
,
_
this
_
is
a
girl
that
I
'm
letting
that
old
reptile
*NL*
rob
her
of
her
money
!
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Susan
_
she
_
waltzed
in
;
and
if
you
'll
believe
me
,
she
did
give
*NL*
Hare-lip
hark
from
the
tomb
!
*NL*
*NL*
Says
I
to
myself
,
and
this
is
_
another
_
one
that
I
'm
letting
him
rob
*NL*
her
of
her
money
!
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Mary
Jane
she
took
another
inning
,
and
went
in
sweet
and
lovely
*NL*
again
--
which
was
her
way
;
but
when
she
got
done
there
war
n't
hardly
*NL*
anything
left
o
'
poor
Hare-lip
.
So
she
hollered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
then
,
''
says
the
other
girls
;
``
you
just
ask
his
pardon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
done
it
,
too
;
and
she
done
it
beautiful
.
She
done
it
so
beautiful
*NL*
it
was
good
to
hear
;
and
I
wished
I
could
tell
her
a
thousand
lies
,
so
*NL*
she
could
do
it
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
says
to
myself
,
this
is
_
another
_
one
that
I
'm
letting
him
rob
her
*NL*
of
her
money
.
And
when
she
got
through
they
all
jest
laid
theirselves
*NL*
out
to
make
me
feel
at
home
and
know
I
was
amongst
friends
.
I
felt
so
*NL*
ornery
and
low
down
and
mean
that
I
says
to
myself
,
my
mind
's
made
up
;
*NL*
I
'll
hive
that
money
for
them
or
bust
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
then
I
lit
out
--
for
bed
,
I
said
,
meaning
some
time
or
another
.
When
*NL*
I
got
by
myself
I
went
to
thinking
the
thing
over
.
I
says
to
myself
,
*NL*
shall
I
go
to
that
doctor
,
private
,
and
blow
on
these
frauds
?
No
--
that
*NL*
wo
n't
do
.
He
might
tell
who
told
him
;
then
the
king
and
the
duke
would
*NL*
make
it
warm
for
me
.
Shall
I
go
,
private
,
and
tell
Mary
Jane
?
No
--
I
*NL*
das
n't
do
it
.
Her
face
would
give
them
a
hint
,
sure
;
they
've
got
the
*NL*
money
,
and
they
'd
slide
right
out
and
get
away
with
it
.
If
she
was
to
*NL*
fetch
in
help
I
'd
get
mixed
up
in
the
business
before
it
was
done
*NL*
with
,
I
judge
.
No
;
there
ai
n't
no
good
way
but
one
.
I
got
to
steal
*NL*
that
money
,
somehow
;
and
I
got
to
steal
it
some
way
that
they
wo
n't
*NL*
suspicion
that
I
done
it
.
They
've
got
a
good
thing
here
,
and
they
*NL*
ai
n't
a-going
to
leave
till
they
've
played
this
family
and
this
town
*NL*
for
all
they
're
worth
,
so
I
'll
find
a
chance
time
enough
.
I
'll
steal
*NL*
it
and
hide
it
;
and
by
and
by
,
when
I
'm
away
down
the
river
,
I
'll
*NL*
write
a
letter
and
tell
Mary
Jane
where
it
's
hid
.
But
I
better
hive
it
*NL*
to-night
if
I
can
,
because
the
doctor
maybe
has
n't
let
up
as
much
as
*NL*
he
lets
on
he
has
;
he
might
scare
them
out
of
here
yet
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
,
thinks
I
,
I
'll
go
and
search
them
rooms
.
Upstairs
the
hall
was
*NL*
dark
,
but
I
found
the
duke
's
room
,
and
started
to
paw
around
it
with
*NL*
my
hands
;
but
I
recollected
it
would
n't
be
much
like
the
king
to
let
*NL*
anybody
else
take
care
of
that
money
but
his
own
self
;
so
then
I
went
*NL*
to
his
room
and
begun
to
paw
around
there
.
But
I
see
I
could
n't
do
*NL*
nothing
without
a
candle
,
and
I
das
n't
light
one
,
of
course
.
So
I
*NL*
judged
I
'd
got
to
do
the
other
thing
--
lay
for
them
and
eavesdrop
.
*NL*
About
that
time
I
hears
their
footsteps
coming
,
and
was
going
to
skip
*NL*
under
the
bed
;
I
reached
for
it
,
but
it
was
n't
where
I
thought
it
*NL*
would
be
;
but
I
touched
the
curtain
that
hid
Mary
Jane
's
frocks
,
so
I
*NL*
jumped
in
behind
that
and
snuggled
in
amongst
the
gowns
,
and
stood
*NL*
there
perfectly
still
.
They
come
in
and
shut
the
door
;
and
the
first
*NL*
thing
the
duke
done
was
to
get
down
and
look
under
the
bed
.
Then
I
was
*NL*
glad
I
had
n't
found
the
bed
when
I
wanted
it
.
And
yet
,
you
know
,
it
's
*NL*
kind
of
natural
to
hide
under
the
bed
when
you
are
up
to
anything
*NL*
private
.
They
sets
down
then
,
and
the
king
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
is
it
?
And
cut
it
middlin
'
short
,
because
it
's
better
for
*NL*
us
to
be
down
there
a-whoopin
'
up
the
mournin
'
than
up
here
givin
'
'em
*NL*
a
chance
to
talk
us
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
this
is
it
,
Capet
.
I
ai
n't
easy
;
I
ai
n't
comfortable

That
*NL*
doctor
lays
on
my
mind
.
I
wanted
to
know
your
plans
.
I
've
got
a
*NL*
notion
,
and
I
think
it
's
a
sound
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
,
duke
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
we
better
glide
out
of
this
before
three
in
the
morning
,
and
*NL*
clip
it
down
the
river
with
what
we
've
got
.
Specially
,
seeing
we
got
*NL*
it
so
easy
--
_
given
_
back
to
us
,
flung
at
our
heads
,
as
you
may
say
,
*NL*
when
of
course
we
allowed
to
have
to
steal
it
back
.
I
'm
for
knocking
*NL*
off
and
lighting
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
made
me
feel
pretty
bad
.
About
an
hour
or
two
ago
it
would
`
a
'
*NL*
been
a
little
different
,
but
now
it
made
me
feel
bad
and
disappointed
.
*NL*
The
king
rips
out
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
And
not
sell
out
the
rest
o
'
the
property

March
off

a

passel

*NL*
*NL*
The
duke
he
grumbled
;
said
the
bag
of
gold
was
enough
,
and
he
did
n't
*NL*
want
to
go
no
deeper
--
did
n't
want
to
rob
a
lot
of
orphans
of

_
everything

they
had

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

says
the
king
.
``

did
n't
own
*NL*
it
--
which
wo
n't
be
long
after
we
've
slid
--
the
sale
wo
n't
be
valid
,
and
*NL*
it
'll
all
go
back
to
the
estate
.
These
yer
orphans
'll
git
their
*NL*
house
back
ag
`
in
,
and
that
's
enough
for
_
them
;
_
they
're
young
and
*NL*
spry
,
and
k
'n
easy
earn
a
livin
'
.
_
They
_
ai
n't
a-goin
'
to
suffer
.
Why
,
*NL*
jest
think
--
there
's
thous
'n'
s
and
thous
'n'
s
that
ai
n't
nigh
so
well
*NL*
off
.
Bless
you
,
_
they
_
ai
n't
got
noth
'n'
to
complain
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
the
king
he
talked
him
blind
;
so
at
last
he
give
in
,
and
said
*NL*
all
right
,
but
said
he
believed
it
was
blamed
foolishness
to
stay
,
and
*NL*
that
doctor
hanging
over
them
.
But
the
king
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cuss
the
doctor
!
What
do
we
k
`
yer
for
_
him
?
_
Hai
n't
we
got
all
the
*NL*
fools
in
town
on
our
side
?
And
ai
n't
that
a
big
enough
majority
in
any
*NL*
town
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
they
got
ready
to
go
down-stairs
again
.
The
duke
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
we
put
that
money
in
a
good
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
cheered
me
up
.
I
'd
begun
to
think
I
war
n't
going
to
get
a
hint
of
*NL*
no
kind
to
help
me
.
The
king
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
Mary
Jane
'll
be
in
mourning
from
this
out
;
and
first
you
*NL*
know
the
nigger
that
does
up
the
rooms
will
get
an
order
to
box
these
*NL*
duds
up
and
put
'em
away
;
and
do
you
reckon
a
nigger
can
run
across
*NL*
money
and
not
borrow
some
of
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
head
's
level
ag
`
in
,
duke
,
''
says
the
king
;
and
he
comes
*NL*
a-fumbling
under
the
curtain
two
or
three
foot
from
where
I
was
.
I
*NL*
stuck
tight
to
the
wall
and
kept
mighty
still
,
though
quivery
;
and
I
*NL*
wondered
what
them
fellows
would
say
to
me
if
they
catched
me
;
and
I
*NL*
tried
to
think
what
I
'd
better
do
if
they
did
catch
me
.
But
the
king
*NL*
he
got
the
bag
before
I
could
think
more
than
about
a
half
a
thought
,
*NL*
and
he
never
suspicioned
I
was
around
.
They
took
and
shoved
the
bag
*NL*
through
a
rip
in
the
straw
tick
that
was
under
the
feather-bed
,
and
*NL*
crammed
it
in
a
foot
or
two
amongst
the
straw
and
said
it
was
all
*NL*
right
now
,
because
a
nigger
only
makes
up
the
feather-bed
,
and
do
n't
*NL*
turn
over
the
straw
tick
only
about
twice
a
year
,
and
so
it
war
n't
in
*NL*
no
danger
of
getting
stole
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
knowed
better
.
I
had
it
out
of
there
before
they
was
half-way
*NL*
down-stairs
.
I
groped
along
up
to
my
cubby
,
and
hid
it
there
till
I
*NL*
could
get
a
chance
to
do
better
.
I
judged
I
better
hide
it
outside
of
*NL*
the
house
somewheres
,
because
if
they
missed
it
they
would
give
the
*NL*
house
a
good
ransacking
:
I
knowed
that
very
well
.
Then
I
turned
in
,
*NL*
with
my
clothes
all
on
;
but
I
could
n't
`
a
'
gone
to
sleep
if
I
'd
`
a
'
*NL*
wanted
to
,
I
was
in
such
a
sweat
to
get
through
with
the
business
.
By
*NL*
and
by
I
heard
the
king
and
the
duke
come
up
;
so
I
rolled
off
my
*NL*
pallet
and
laid
with
my
chin
at
the
top
of
my
ladder
,
and
waited
to
*NL*
see
if
anything
was
going
to
happen
.
But
nothing
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
I
held
on
till
all
the
late
sounds
had
quit
and
the
early
ones
*NL*
had
n't
begun
yet
;
and
then
I
slipped
down
the
ladder
.
*NL*

CHAPTER
XXVII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
crept
to
their
doors
and
listened
;
they
was
snoring
.
So
I
tiptoed
*NL*
along
,
and
got
downstairs
all
right
.
There
war
n't
a
sound
anywheres
.
I
*NL*
peeped
through
a
crack
of
the
dining-room
door
,
and
see
the
men
that
*NL*
was
watching
the
corpse
all
sound
asleep
on
their
chairs
.
The
door
was
*NL*
open
into
the
parlor
,
where
the
corpse
was
laying
,
and
there
was
a
*NL*
candle
in
both
rooms
.
I
passed
along
,
and
the
parlor
door
was
open
;
*NL*
but
I
see
there
war
n't
nobody
in
there
but
the
remainders
of
Peter
;
so
*NL*
I
shoved
on
by
;
but
the
front
door
was
locked
,
and
the
key
was
n't
*NL*
there
.
Just
then
I
heard
somebody
coming
down
the
stairs
,
back
behind
*NL*
me
.
I
run
in
the
parlor
and
took
a
swift
look
around
,
and
the
only
*NL*
place
I
see
to
hide
the
bag
was
in
the
coffin
.
The
lid
was
shoved
*NL*
along
about
a
foot
,
showing
the
dead
man
's
face
down
in
there
,
with
a
*NL*
wet
cloth
over
it
,
and
his
shroud
on
.
I
tucked
the
money-bag
in
under
*NL*
the
lid
,
just
down
beyond
where
his
hands
was
crossed
,
which
made
me
*NL*
creep
,
they
was
so
cold
,
and
then
I
run
back
across
the
room
and
in
*NL*
behind
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
person
coming
was
Mary
Jane
.
She
went
to
the
coffin
,
very
soft
,
*NL*
and
kneeled
down
and
looked
in
;
then
she
put
up
her
handkerchief
,
and
*NL*
I
see
she
begun
to
cry
,
though
I
could
n't
hear
her
,
and
her
back
was
*NL*
to
me
.
I
slid
out
,
and
as
I
passed
the
dining-room
I
thought
I
'd
make
*NL*
sure
them
watchers
had
n't
seen
me
;
so
I
looked
through
the
crack
,
and
*NL*
everything
was
all
right
.
They
had
n't
stirred
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
slipped
up
to
bed
,
feeling
ruther
blue
,
on
accounts
of
the
thing
*NL*
playing
out
that
way
after
I
had
took
so
much
trouble
and
run
so
much
*NL*
resk
about
it
.
Says
I
,
if
it
could
stay
where
it
is
,
all
right
;
*NL*
because
when
we
get
down
the
river
a
hundred
mile
or
two
I
could
write
*NL*
back
to
Mary
Jane
,
and
she
could
dig
him
up
again
and
get
it
;
but
that
*NL*
ai
n't
the
thing
that
's
going
to
happen
;
the
thing
that
's
going
to
*NL*
happen
is
,
the
money
'll
be
found
when
they
come
to
screw
on
the
lid
.
*NL*
Then
the
king
'll
get
it
again
,
and
it
'll
be
a
long
day
before
he
*NL*
gives
anybody
another
chance
to
smouch
it
from
him
.
Of
course
I
*NL*
_
wanted
_
to
slide
down
and
get
it
out
of
there
,
but
I
das
n't
try
it
.
*NL*
Every
minute
it
was
getting
earlier
now
,
and
pretty
soon
some
of
them
*NL*
watchers
would
begin
to
stir
,
and
I
might
get
catched
--
catched
with
*NL*
six
thousand
dollars
in
my
hands
that
nobody
had
n't
hired
me
to
take
*NL*
care
of
.
I
do
n't
wish
to
be
mixed
up
in
no
such
business
as
that
,
I
*NL*
says
to
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
got
down-stairs
in
the
morning
the
parlor
was
shut
up
,
and
the
*NL*
watchers
was
gone
.
There
war
n't
nobody
around
but
the
family
and
the
*NL*
widow
Bartley
and
our
tribe
.
I
watched
their
faces
to
see
if
anything
*NL*
had
been
happening
,
but
I
could
n't
tell
.
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
the
middle
of
the
day
the
undertaker
come
with
his
man
,
and
*NL*
they
set
the
coffin
in
the
middle
of
the
room
on
a
couple
of
chairs
,
*NL*
and
then
set
all
our
chairs
in
rows
,
and
borrowed
more
from
the
*NL*
neighbors
till
the
hall
and
the
parlor
and
the
dining-room
was
full
.
I
*NL*
see
the
coffin
lid
was
the
way
it
was
before
,
but
I
das
n't
go
to
look
*NL*
in
under
it
,
with
folks
around
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
people
begun
to
flock
in
,
and
the
beats
and
the
girls
took
*NL*
seats
in
the
front
row
at
the
head
of
the
coffin
,
and
for
a
half
an
*NL*
hour
the
people
filed
around
slow
,
in
single
rank
,
and
looked
down
at
*NL*
the
dead
man
's
face
a
minute
,
and
some
dropped
in
a
tear
,
and
it
was
*NL*
all
very
still
and
solemn
,
only
the
girls
and
the
beats
holding
*NL*
handkerchiefs
to
their
eyes
and
keeping
their
heads
bent
,
and
sobbing
*NL*
a
little
.
There
war
n't
no
other
sound
but
the
scraping
of
the
feet
on
*NL*
the
floor
and
blowing
noses
--
because
people
always
blows
them
more
at
*NL*
a
funeral
than
they
do
at
other
places
except
church
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
place
was
packed
full
the
undertaker
he
slid
around
in
his
*NL*
black
gloves
with
his
softy
soothering
ways
,
putting
on
the
last
*NL*
touches
,
and
getting
people
and
things
all
ship-shape
and
comfortable
,
*NL*
and
making
no
more
sound
than
a
cat
.
He
never
spoke
;
he
moved
people
*NL*
around
,
he
squeezed
in
late
ones
,
he
opened
up
passageways
,
and
done
*NL*
it
with
nods
,
and
signs
with
his
hands
.
Then
he
took
his
place
over
*NL*
against
the
wall
.
He
was
the
softest
,
glidingest
,
stealthiest
man
I
*NL*
ever
see
;
and
there
war
n't
no
more
smile
to
him
than
there
is
to
a
*NL*
ham
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
borrowed
a
melodeum
--
a
sick
one
;
and
when
everything
was
*NL*
ready
a
young
woman
set
down
and
worked
it
,
and
it
was
pretty
skreeky
*NL*
and
colicky
,
and
everybody
joined
in
and
sung
,
and
Peter
was
the
only
*NL*
one
that
had
a
good
thing
,
according
to
my
notion
.
Then
the
Reverend
*NL*
Hobson
opened
up
,
slow
and
solemn
,
and
begun
to
talk
;
and
straight
off
*NL*
the
most
outrageous
row
busted
out
in
the
cellar
a
body
ever
heard
;
it
*NL*
was
only
one
dog
,
but
he
made
a
most
powerful
racket
,
and
he
kept
it
*NL*
up
right
along
;
the
parson
he
had
to
stand
there
,
over
the
coffin
,
and
*NL*
wait
--
you
could
n't
hear
yourself
think
.
It
was
right
down
awkward
,
and
*NL*
nobody
did
n't
seem
to
know
what
to
do
.
But
pretty
soon
they
see
that
*NL*
long-legged
undertaker
make
a
sign
to
the
preacher
as
much
as
to
say
,
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
worry
--
just
depend
on
me
.
''
Then
he
stooped
down
and
begun
*NL*
to
glide
along
the
wall
,
just
his
shoulders
showing
over
the
people
's
*NL*
heads
.
So
he
glided
along
,
and
the
powwow
and
racket
getting
more
and
*NL*
more
outrageous
all
the
time
;
and
at
last
,
when
he
had
gone
around
two
*NL*
sides
of
the
room
,
he
disappears
down
cellar
.
Then
in
about
two
*NL*
seconds
we
heard
a
whack
,
and
the
dog
he
finished
up
with
a
most
*NL*
amazing
howl
or
two
,
and
then
everything
was
dead
still
,
and
the
*NL*
parson
begun
his
solemn
talk
where
he
left
off
.
In
a
minute
or
two
*NL*
here
comes
this
undertaker
's
back
and
shoulders
gliding
along
the
wall
*NL*
again
;
and
so
he
glided
and
glided
around
three
sides
of
the
room
,
and
*NL*
then
rose
up
,
and
shaded
his
mouth
with
his
hands
,
and
stretched
his
*NL*
neck
out
towards
the
preacher
,
over
the
people
's
heads
,
and
says
,
in
a
*NL*
kind
of
a
coarse
whisper
,
''
_
He
had
a
rat
!
_
''
Then
he
drooped
down
and
*NL*
glided
along
the
wall
again
to
his
place
.
You
could
see
it
was
a
great
*NL*
satisfaction
to
the
people
,
because
naturally
they
wanted
to
know
.
A
*NL*
little
thing
like
that
do
n't
cost
nothing
,
and
it
's
just
the
little
*NL*
things
that
makes
a
man
to
be
looked
up
to
and
liked
.
There
war
n't
no
*NL*
more
popular
man
in
town
than
what
that
undertaker
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
the
funeral
sermon
was
very
good
,
but
pison
long
and
tiresome
;
*NL*
and
then
the
king
he
shoved
in
and
got
off
some
of
his
usual
rubbage
,
*NL*
and
at
last
the
job
was
through
,
and
the
undertaker
begun
to
sneak
up
*NL*
on
the
coffin
with
his
screw-driver
.
I
was
in
a
sweat
then
,
and
*NL*
watched
him
pretty
keen
.
But
he
never
meddled
at
all
;
just
slid
the
*NL*
lid
along
as
soft
as
mush
,
and
screwed
it
down
tight
and
fast
.
So
*NL*
there
I
was
!
I
did
n't
know
whether
the
money
was
in
there
or
not
.
So
,
*NL*
says
I
,
s
`
pose
somebody
has
hogged
that
bag
on
the
sly
?
--
now
how
do
*NL*
_
I
_
know
whether
to
write
to
Mary
Jane
or
not
?
S'pose
she
dug
him
up
*NL*
and
did
n't
find
nothing
,
what
would
she
think
of
me
?
Blame
it
,
I
says
,
*NL*
I
might
get
hunted
up
and
jailed
;
I
'd
better
lay
low
and
keep
dark
,
*NL*
and
not
write
at
all
;
the
thing
's
awful
mixed
now
;
trying
to
better
*NL*
it
,
I
've
worsened
it
a
hundred
times
,
and
I
wish
to
goodness
I
'd
just
*NL*
let
it
alone
,
dad
fetch
the
whole
business
!
*NL*
*NL*
They
buried
him
,
and
we
come
back
home
,
and
I
went
to
watching
faces
*NL*
again
--
I
could
n't
help
it
,
and
I
could
n't
rest
easy
.
But
nothing
come
*NL*
of
it
;
the
faces
did
n't
tell
me
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
king
he
visited
around
in
the
evening
,
and
sweetened
everybody
up
,
*NL*
and
made
himself
ever
so
friendly
;
and
he
give
out
the
idea
that
his
*NL*
congregation
over
in
England
would
be
in
a
sweat
about
him
,
so
he
must
*NL*
hurry
and
settle
up
the
estate
right
away
and
leave
for
home
.
He
was
*NL*
very
sorry
he
was
so
pushed
,
and
so
was
everybody
;
they
wished
he
*NL*
could
stay
longer
,
but
they
said
they
could
see
it
could
n't
be
done
.
*NL*
And
he
said
of
course
him
and
William
would
take
the
girls
home
with
*NL*
them
;
and
that
pleased
everybody
too
,
because
then
the
girls
would
be
*NL*
well
fixed
and
amongst
their
own
relations
;
and
it
pleased
the
girls
,
*NL*
too
--
tickled
them
so
they
clean
forgot
they
ever
had
a
trouble
in
the
*NL*
world
;
and
told
him
to
sell
out
as
quick
as
he
wanted
to
,
they
would
*NL*
be
ready
.
Them
poor
things
was
that
glad
and
happy
it
made
my
heart
*NL*
ache
to
see
them
getting
fooled
and
lied
to
so
,
but
I
did
n't
see
no
*NL*
safe
way
for
me
to
chip
in
and
change
the
general
tune
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
blamed
if
the
king
did
n't
bill
the
house
and
the
niggers
and
all
*NL*
the
property
for
auction
straight
off
--
sale
two
days
after
the
*NL*
funeral
;
but
anybody
could
buy
private
beforehand
if
they
wanted
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
next
day
after
the
funeral
,
along
about
noon-time
,
the
girls
'
*NL*
joy
got
the
first
jolt
.
A
couple
of
nigger-traders
come
along
,
and
the
*NL*
king
sold
them
the
niggers
reasonable
,
for
three-day
drafts
as
they
*NL*
called
it
,
and
away
they
went
,
the
two
sons
up
the
river
to
Memphis
,
*NL*
and
their
mother
down
the
river
to
Orleans
.
I
thought
them
poor
girls
*NL*
and
them
niggers
would
break
their
hearts
for
grief
;
they
cried
around
*NL*
each
other
,
and
took
on
so
it
most
made
me
down
sick
to
see
it
.
The
*NL*
girls
said
they
had
n't
ever
dreamed
of
seeing
the
family
separated
or
*NL*
sold
away
from
the
town
.
I
ca
n't
ever
get
it
out
of
my
memory
,
the
*NL*
sight
of
them
poor
miserable
girls
and
niggers
hanging
around
each
*NL*
other
's
necks
and
crying
;
and
I
reckon
I
could
n't
`
a
'
stood
it
all
,
*NL*
but
would
`
a
'
had
to
bust
out
and
tell
on
our
gang
if
I
had
n't
knowed
*NL*
the
sale
war
n't
no
account
and
the
niggers
would
be
back
home
in
a
*NL*
week
or
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
thing
made
a
big
stir
in
the
town
,
too
,
and
a
good
many
come
out
*NL*
flatfooted
and
said
it
was
scandalous
to
separate
the
mother
and
the
*NL*
children
that
way
.
It
injured
the
frauds
some
;
but
the
old
fool
he
*NL*
bulled
right
along
,
spite
of
all
the
duke
could
say
or
do
,
and
I
tell
*NL*
you
the
duke
was
powerful
uneasy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
was
auction
day
.
About
broad
day
in
the
morning
the
king
and
*NL*
the
duke
come
up
in
the
garret
and
woke
me
up
,
and
I
see
by
their
look
*NL*
that
there
was
trouble
.
The
king
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
you
in
my
room
night
before
last
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
your
majesty
''
--
which
was
the
way
I
always
called
him
when
nobody
*NL*
but
our
gang
war
n't
around
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
you
in
there
yisterday
er
last
night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
your
majesty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Honor
bright
,
now
--
no
lies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Honor
bright
,
your
majesty
,
I
'm
telling
you
the
truth
.
I
hai
n't
been
*NL*
a-near
your
room
since
Miss
Mary
Jane
took
you
and
the
duke
and
showed
*NL*
it
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
duke
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
seen
anybody
else
go
in
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
your
grace
,
not
as
I
remember
,
I
believe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
and
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
studied
awhile
and
see
my
chance
;
then
I
says
:
``
Well
,
I
see
the
*NL*
niggers
go
in
there
several
times
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Both
of
them
gave
a
little
jump
,
and
looked
like
they
had
n't
ever
*NL*
expected
it
,
and
then
like
they
_
had
_
.
Then
the
duke
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
_
all
_
of
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
leastways
,
not
all
at
once
--
that
is
,
I
do
n't
think
I
ever
see
*NL*
them
all
come
_
out
_
at
once
but
just
one
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hello
!
When
was
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
the
day
we
had
the
funeral
.
In
the
morning
.
It
war
n't
early
,
*NL*
because
I
overslept
.
I
was
just
starting
down
the
ladder
,
and
I
see
*NL*
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
go
on
,
_
go
_
on
!
What
did
they
do
?
How
'd
they
act
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
did
n't
do
nothing
.
And
they
did
n't
act
anyway
much
,
as
fur
as
I
*NL*
see
.
They
tiptoed
away
;
so
I
seen
,
easy
enough
,
that
they
'd
shoved
in
*NL*
there
to
do
up
your
majesty
's
room
,
or
something
,
s
`
posing
you
was
up
;
*NL*
and
found
you
_
war
n't
_
up
,
and
so
they
was
hoping
to
slide
out
of
the
*NL*
way
of
trouble
without
waking
you
up
,
if
they
had
n't
already
waked
you
*NL*
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Great
guns
,
_
this
_
is
a
go
!
''
says
the
king
;
and
both
of
them
looked
*NL*
pretty
sick
and
tolerable
silly
.
They
stood
there
a-thinking
and
*NL*
scratching
their
heads
a
minute
,
and
the
duke
he
bust
into
a
kind
of
a
*NL*
little
raspy
chuckle
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
does
beat
all
how
neat
the
niggers
played
their
hand
.
They
let
on
*NL*
to
be
_
sorry
_
they
was
going
out
of
this
region
!
And
I
believed
they
*NL*
_
was
_
sorry
,
and
so
did
you
,
and
so
did
everybody
.
Do
n't
ever
tell
*NL*
_
me
_
any
more
that
a
nigger
ai
n't
got
any
histrionic
talent
.
Why
,
the
*NL*
way
they
played
that
thing
it
would
fool
_
anybody
.
_
In
my
opinion
,
*NL*
there
's
a
fortune
in
'em
.
If
I
had
capital
and
a
theater
,
I
would
n't
*NL*
want
a
better
lay-out
than
that
--
and
here
we
've
gone
and
sold
'em
for
*NL*
a
song
.
Yes
,
and
ai
n't
privileged
to
sing
the
song
yet
.
Say
,
where
*NL*
_
is
_
that
song
--
that
draft
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
bank
for
to
be
collected
.
Where
_
would
_
it
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
's
all
right
then
,
thank
goodness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Says
I
,
kind
of
timid-like
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
something
gone
wrong
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
king
whirls
on
me
and
rips
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
None
o
'
your
business
!
You
keep
your
head
shet
,
and
mind
y'
r
own
*NL*
affairs

if
you
got
any
.
Long
as
you
're
in
this
town
do
n't
you
forgit
*NL*
_
that
_
--
you
hear
?
''
Then
he
says
to
the
duke
,
``
We
got
to
jest
swaller
*NL*
it
and
say
noth
'n'
:
mum
's
the
word
for

us
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
was
starting
down
the
ladder
the
duke
he
chuckles
again
,
and
*NL*
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quick
sales
_
and
_
small
profits
!
It
's
a
good
business
--
yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
king
snarls
around
on
him
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
trying
to
do
for
the
best
in
sellin
'
'em
out
so
quick
.
If
the
*NL*
profits
has
turned
out
to
be
none
,
lackin
'
considable
,
and
none
to
*NL*
carry
,
is
it
my
fault
any
more
'n
it
's
yourn
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
_
they
'd
_
be
in
this
house
yet
and
we
_
would
n't
_
if
I
could
`
a
'
*NL*
got
my
advice
listened
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
king
sassed
back
as
much
as
was
safe
for
him
,
and
then
swapped
*NL*
around
and
lit
into
_
me
_
again
.
He
give
me
down
the
banks
for
not
*NL*
coming
and
_
telling
_
him
I
see
the
niggers
come
out
of
his
room
acting
*NL*
that
way
--
said
any
fool
would
`
a
'
_
knowed
_
something
was
up
.
And
then
*NL*
waltzed
in
and
cussed
_
himself
_
awhile
,
and
said
it
all
come
of
him
*NL*
not
laying
late
and
taking
his
natural
rest
that
morning
,
and
he
'd
be
*NL*
blamed
if
he
'd
ever
do
it
again
.
So
they
went
off
a-jawing
;
and
I
felt
*NL*
dreadful
glad
I
'd
worked
it
all
off
onto
the
niggers
,
and
yet
had
n't
*NL*
done
the
niggers
no
harm
by
it
.

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
XXVIII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
By
and
by
it
was
getting-up
time
.
So
I
come
down
the
ladder
and
*NL*
started
for
down-stairs
;
but
as
I
come
to
the
girls
'
room
the
door
was
*NL*
open
,
and
I
see
Mary
Jane
setting
by
her
old
hair
trunk
,
which
was
*NL*
open
and
she
'd
been
packing
things
in
it
--
getting
ready
to
go
to
*NL*
England
.
But
she
had
stopped
now
with
a
folded
gown
in
her
lap
,
and
*NL*
had
her
face
in
her
hands
,
crying
.
I
felt
awful
bad
to
see
it
;
of
*NL*
course
anybody
would
.
I
went
in
there
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Mary
Jane
,
you
ca
n't
a-bear
to
see
people
in
trouble
,
and
_
I
_
*NL*
ca
n't
--
most
always
.
Tell
me
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
she
done
it
.
And
it
was
the
niggers
--
I
just
expected
it
.
She
said
*NL*
the
beautiful
trip
to
England
was
most
about
spoiled
for
her
;
she
*NL*
did
n't
know
_
how
_
she
was
ever
going
to
be
happy
there
,
knowing
the
*NL*
mother
and
the
children
war
n't
ever
going
to
see
each
other
no
*NL*
more
--
and
then
busted
out
bitterer
than
ever
,
and
flung
up
her
hands
,
*NL*
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dear
,
dear
,
to
think
they
ai
n't
_
ever
_
going
to
see
each
other
*NL*
any
more
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
they
_
will
_
--
and
inside
of
two
weeks
--
and
I
_
know
_
it
!
''
says
I.
*NL*
*NL*
Laws
,
it
was
out
before
I
could
think
!
And
before
I
could
budge
she
*NL*
throws
her
arms
around
my
neck
and
told
me
to
say
it
_
again
_
,
say
it
*NL*
_
again
_
,
say
it
_
again
!
_
*NL*
*NL*
I
see
I
had
spoke
too
sudden
and
said
too
much
,
and
was
in
a
close
*NL*
place
.
I
asked
her
to
let
me
think
a
minute
;
and
she
set
there
,
very
*NL*
impatient
and
excited
and
handsome
,
but
looking
kind
of
happy
and
*NL*
eased-up
,
like
a
person
that
's
had
a
tooth
pulled
out
.
So
I
went
to
*NL*
studying
it
out
.
I
says
to
myself
,
I
reckon
a
body
that
ups
and
tells
*NL*
the
truth
when
he
is
in
a
tight
place
is
taking
considerable
many
*NL*
resks
,
though
I
ai
n't
had
no
experience
,
and
ca
n't
say
for
certain
;
*NL*
but
it
looks
so
to
me
,
anyway
;
and
yet
here
's
a
case
where
I
'm
blest
*NL*
if
it
do
n't
look
to
me
like
the
truth
is
better
and
actuly
_
safer
_
*NL*
than
a
lie
.
I
must
lay
it
by
in
my
mind
,
and
think
it
over
some
time
*NL*
or
other
,
it
's
so
kind
of
strange
and
unregular
.
I
never
see
nothing
*NL*
like
it
.
Well
,
I
says
to
myself
at
last
,
I
'm
a-going
to
chance
it
;
*NL*
I
'll
up
and
tell
the
truth
this
time
,
though
it
does
seem
most
_
like
_
*NL*
setting
down
on
a
kag
of
powder
and
touching
it
off
just
to
see
where
*NL*
you
'll
go
to
.
Then
I
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Mary
Jane
,
is
there
any
place
out
of
town
a
little
ways
where
*NL*
you
could
go
and
stay
three
or
four
days
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
Mr.
Lothrop
's
.
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
why
yet
.
If
I
'll
tell
you
how
I
know
the
niggers
will
see
*NL*
each
other
again
--
inside
of
two
weeks
--
here
in
this
house
--
and
_
prove
_
*NL*
how
I
know
it
--
will
you
go
to
Mr.
Lothrop
's
and
stay
four
days
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Four
days
!
''
she
says
;
``
I
'll
stay
a
year
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
I
says
,
``
I
do
n't
want
nothing
more
out
of
_
you
_
than
just
*NL*
your
word
--
I
druther
have
it
than
another
man
's
kiss-the-Bible
.
''
She
*NL*
smiled
and
reddened
up
very
sweet
,
and
I
says
,
``
If
you
do
n't
mind
it
,
*NL*
I
'll
shut
the
door
--
and
bolt
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
I
come
back
and
set
down
again
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
holler
.
Just
set
still
and
take
it
like
a
man
.
I
got
to
*NL*

the
truth

you
want
to
brace
up

Miss
Mary

it
's
a
*NL*
bad
kind
,
and
going
to
be
hard
to
take

there
ai
n't
no

for
*NL*
it

These
uncles
of
yourn
ai
n't
no

at
all

they
're
a
couple
of
*NL*
frauds

regular
dead-beats

There

over
the
worst
of

*NL*
can
stand
the
rest
middling
easy

''
*NL*
*NL*
It
jolted
her
up
like
everything
,
of
course
;
but
I
was
over
the
shoal
*NL*
water
now
,
so
I
went
right
along
,
her
eyes
a-blazing
higher
and
higher
*NL*
all
the
time
,
and
told
her
every
blame
thing
,
from
where
we
first
*NL*
struck
that
young
fool
going
up
to
the
steamboat
,
clear
through
to
*NL*
where
she
flung
herself
onto
the
king
's
breast
at
the
front
door
and
*NL*
he
kissed
her
sixteen
or
seventeen
times
--
and
then
up
she
jumps
,
with
*NL*
her
face
afire
like
sunset
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
brute
!
Come
,
do
n't
waste
a
minute

not
a
_
second

we
'll
have
*NL*
them
tarred
and
feathered
,
and
flung
in
the
river
!

*NL*
*NL*
Says
I
:
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

she
says
,
``
what

''
she
says
,

set
right
*NL*
down
again
.
``

''
Laying
her
silky
hand
on
mine
in
that
kind
of
a
way
that
*NL*
I
said
I
would
die
first
.
``
I
never

I
was
so
stirred
up

she

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

I
says
,
``
it
's
a
rough

with

a
while
longer

whether

I

if

blow
on

this
town
*NL*
would
get
me
out

and
I
'd
be

there

be
*NL*
another

*NL*
Well

Of

Well

*NL*
*NL*
Saying
them
words
put
a
good
idea
in
my
head
.
I
see
how
maybe
I
could
*NL*
get
me
and
Jim
rid
of
the
frauds
;
get
them
jailed
here
,
and
then
*NL*
leave

But
I
did
n't
want
to
run
the
raft
in
the
daytime
without
*NL*
anybody
aboard
to
answer
questions
but
me
;
so
I
did
n't
want
the
plan
*NL*
to
begin
working
till
pretty
late
to-night

I
says
:
*NL*
*NL*

out

you

up

*NL*

I
see
her

spread

snap

it

too

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
I
judged
we
had
got
everything
fixed
about
right
now

So
I
says

*NL*

Just

so

no
*NL*
harm
in
it

It
was
only
a
little
thing
to
do

no

it

*NL*
the
little
things

down

nothing

Then
I

``

*NL*
*NL*
I
did
n't
want
to

to
thinking
about
her
troubles
again
;
and
I
*NL*
could
n't
seem
to
get
my
mouth
to
tell
her
what
would
make
her
see
that
*NL*
corpse
laying
in
the
coffin
with
that
bag
of
money
on
his
stomach
.
So
*NL*
for
a
minute
I
did
n't
say
nothing
;
then
I
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``

off

I
'll
write
it
for

you
can
read
it
along

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

yes

*NL*
*NL*
So
I
wrote
:
``
I
put
it
in
the
coffin

It
was
in
there
when
you
was
*NL*
crying
there
,
away
in
the
night
.
I
was
behind
the
door
,
and
I
was
*NL*
mighty
sorry
for
you
,
Miss
Mary

''
*NL*
*NL*
It
made
my
eyes
water
a
little
to
remember
her
crying
there
all
by
*NL*
herself
in
the
night
,
and
them
devils
laying
there
right
under
her
own
*NL*
roof
,
shaming
her
and
robbing
her
;
and
when
I
folded
it
up
and
give
it
*NL*
to
her
I
see
the
water
come
into
her
eyes
,
too
;
and
she
shook
me
by
*NL*
the
hand
,
hard
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Good
_
-
by

I
'm
going
to
do
everything
just
as
you
've
told
me
;
and
if
*NL*
I
do
n't
ever
see
you
again
,
I
sha
'n'
t
ever
forget
you
,
and
I
'll
think
*NL*
of
you
a
many
and
a
many
a
time
,
and
I
'll
_
pray
_
for
you
,
too
!
''
--
and
*NL*
she
was
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pray
for
me
!
I
reckoned
if
she
knowed
me
she
'd
take
a
job
that
was
*NL*
more
nearer
her
size
.
But
I
bet
she
done
it
,
just
the
same
--
she
was
*NL*
just
that
kind
.
She
had
the
grit
to
pray
for
Judus
if
she
took
the
*NL*
notion
--
there
war
n't
no
back-down
to
her
,
I
judge
.
You
may
say
what
*NL*
you
want
to
,
but
in
my
opinion
she
had
more
sand
in
her
than
any
girl
*NL*
I
ever
see
;
in
my
opinion
she
was
just
full
of
sand
.
It
sounds
like
*NL*
flattery
,
but
it
ai
n't
no
flattery
.
And
when
it
comes
to
beauty
--
and
*NL*
goodness
,
too
--
she
lays
over
them
all
.
I
hai
n't
ever
seen
her
since
*NL*
that
time
that
I
see
her
go
out
of
that
door
;
no
,
I
hai
n't
ever
seen
*NL*
her
since
,
but
I
reckon
I
've
thought
of
her
a
many
and
a
many
a
*NL*
million
times
,
and
of
her
saying
she
would
pray
for
me
;
and
if
ever
*NL*
I
'd
`
a
'
thought
it
would
do
any
good
for
me
to
pray
for
_
her
_
,
blamed
*NL*
if
I
would
n't

*NL*
Well

Mary
Jane
she
lit
out
the
back
way

I
reckon
;
because
nobody
see
*NL*
her

When
I
struck
Susan
and
the
hare-lip
,
I
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``

They
says

*NL*

I
says
;
``
I
most
forgot
it

Well

*NL*
told
me
to

you

*NL*
``
Which

*NL*
*NL*

They
set
up
with

all

they

``
Only

*NL*
*NL*
I
could
n't
think
of
anything
reasonable

right
off
that

I

says
:

*NL*
``
Mumps

told

out

Everything

The

nothing

the
king

would
ruther
*NL*
Mary
Jane
was
off
working
for
the
auction
than
around
in
reach
of
*NL*
Doctor
Robinson
.
I
felt
very
good
;
I
judged
I
had
done
it
pretty
*NL*
neat
--
I
reckoned
Tom
Sawyer
could
n't
`
a

done
it
no
neater
himself

Of
*NL*
course
he
would
`
a

throwed
more
style
into
it
,
but
I
ca
n't
do
that
*NL*
very
handy
,
not
being
brung
up
to
it

*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
they
held
the
auction
in
the
public
square
,
along
towards
the
*NL*
end
of
the
afternoon
,
and
it
strung
along
,
and
strung
along
,
and
the
*NL*
old
man
he
was
on
hand
and
looking
his
level
pisonest
,
up
there
*NL*
longside
of
the
auctioneer
,
and
chipping
in
a
little
Scripture
now
and
*NL*
then
,
or
a
little
goody-goody
saying
of
some
kind
,
and
the
duke
he
was
*NL*
around
goo-gooing
for
sympathy
all
he
knowed
how
,
and
just
spreading
*NL*
himself
generly
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
by
and
by
the
thing
dragged
through
,
and
everything
was
*NL*
sold
--
everything
but
a
little
old
trifling
lot
in
the
graveyard

So
*NL*
they
'd
got
to
work

that

off

I
never
see
such
a
girafft
as
the
king

was

wanting

swallow

everything

Well
,
whilst
they
was
at
it
a

steamboat
landed
,

in
about
two
minutes
up
comes
a
crowd
a-whooping

yelling

laughing

carrying
on

singing
out

CHAPTER
XXIX
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
They
was
fetching
a
very
nice-looking
old
gentleman
along
,
and
a
*NL*
nice-looking
younger
one
,
with
his
right
arm
in
a
sling
.
And
,
my
*NL*
souls
,
how
the
people
yelled
and
laughed
,
and
kept
it
up
.
But
I
did
n't
*NL*
see
no
joke
about
it
,
and
I
judged
it
would
strain
the
duke
and
the
*NL*
king
some
to
see
any
.
I
reckoned
they
'd
turn
pale
.
But
no
,
nary
a
pale
*NL*
did
_
they
_
turn
.
The
duke
he
never
let
on
he
suspicioned
what
was
up
,
*NL*
but
just
went
a
goo-gooing
around
,
happy
and
satisfied
,
like
a
jug
*NL*
that
's
googling
out
buttermilk
;
and
as
for
the
king
,
he
just
gazed
and
*NL*
gazed
down
sorrowful
on
them
new-comers
like
it
give
him
the
*NL*
stomach-ache
in
his
very
heart
to
think
there
could
be
such
frauds
and
*NL*
rascals
in
the
world
.
Oh
,
he
done
it
admirable
.
Lots
of
the
principal
*NL*
people
gethered
around
the
king
,
to
let
him
see
they
was
on
his
side
.
*NL*
That
old
gentleman
that
had
just
come
looked
all
puzzled
to
death
.
*NL*
Pretty
soon
he
begun
to
speak
,
and
I
see
straight
off
he
pronounced
*NL*
_
like
_
an
Englishman
--
not
the
king
's
way
,
though
the
king
's
_
was
_
*NL*
pretty
good
for
an
imitation
.
I
ca
n't
give
the
old
gent
's
words
,
nor
I
*NL*
ca
n't
imitate
him
;
but
he
turned
around
to
the
crowd
,
and
says
,
about
*NL*
like
this
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
a
surprise
to
me
which
I
was
n't
looking
for
;
and
I
'll
*NL*
acknowledge
,
candid
and
frank
,
I
ai
n't
very
well
fixed
to
meet
it
and
*NL*
answer
it
;
for
my
brother
and
me
has
had
misfortunes
;
he
's
broke
his
*NL*
arm
,
and
our
baggage
got
put
off
at
a
town
above
here
last
night
in
*NL*
the
night
by
a
mistake
.
I
am
Peter
Wilks
's
brother
Harvey
,
and
this
is
*NL*
his
brother
William
,
which
ca
n't
hear
nor
speak
--
and
ca
n't
even
make
*NL*
signs
to
amount
to
much
,
now
'
t
he
's
only
got
one
hand
to
work
them
*NL*
with
.
We
are
who
we
say
we
are
;
and
in
a
day
or
two
,
when
I
get
the
*NL*
baggage
,
I
can
prove
it
.
But
up
till
then
I
wo
n't
say
nothing
more
,
*NL*
but
go
to
the
hotel
and
wait
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
him
and
the
new
dummy
started
off
;
and
the
king
he
laughs
,
and
*NL*
blethers
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Broke
his
arm
--
_
very
_
likely
,
_
ai
n't
_
it
?
--
and
very
convenient
,
too
,
*NL*
for
a
fraud
that
's
got
to
make
signs
,
and
ai
n't
learnt
how
.
Lost
their
*NL*
baggage
!
That
's
_
mighty
_
good
!
--
and
mighty
ingenious
--
under
the
*NL*
_
circumstances
!
_
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
laughed
again
;
and
so
did
everybody
else
,
except
three
or
four
,
*NL*
or
maybe
half
a
dozen
.
One
of
these
was
that
doctor
;
another
one
was
a
*NL*
sharp-looking
gentleman
,
with
a
carpet-bag
of
the
old-fashioned
kind
*NL*
made
out
of
carpet-stuff
,
that
had
just
come
off
of
the
steamboat
and
*NL*
was
talking
to
him
in
a
low
voice
,
and
glancing
towards
the
king
now
*NL*
and
then
and
nodding
their
heads
--
it
was
Levi
Bell
,
the
lawyer
that
*NL*
was
gone
up
to
Louisville
;
and
another
one
was
a
big
rough
husky
that
*NL*
come
along
and
listened
to
all
the
old
gentlemen
said
,
and
was
*NL*
listening
to
the
king
now
.
And
when
the
king
got
done
this
husky
up
*NL*
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
looky
here
;
if
you
are
Harvey
Wilks
,
when
'd
you
come
to
this
*NL*
town

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
day
before
the
funeral

''
says
the
king
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
time
o

day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In

evenin

*NL*
*NL*
``
How

you

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
come
down
on
the
_
Susan
Powell
_
from
Cincinnati

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
how
'd
you
come
to
be
up
at
the
Pint
in

in
*NL*
a

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
war

up

Pint
in
the
mornin
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
lie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Several
of
them
jumped
for
him
and
begged
him
not
to
talk
that
way
to
*NL*
an
old
man
and
a
preacher
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Preacher
be
hanged
,
he
's
a
fraud
and
a
liar

He
was
up
at

Pint

that
mornin
'
.
I
live
up
there
,
do
n't
I
?
Well
,
I
was
up
there
,
and
he
*NL*
was
up
there
.
I
see
him
there
.
He
come
in
a
canoe
,
along
with
Tim
*NL*
Collins
and
a
boy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
he
up
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
know
the
boy
again
if
you
was
to
see
him
,
Hines
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
reckon
I
would
,
but
I
do
n't
know

Why
,
yonder
he
is
,
now
.
I
know
*NL*
him
perfectly
easy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
me
he
pointed
at
.
The
doctor
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Neighbors
,
I
do
n't
know
whether
the
new
couple
is
frauds
or
not
;
but
*NL*
if
_
these
_
two
ai
n't
frauds
,
I
am
an
idiot
,
that
's
all
.
I
think
it
's
*NL*
our
duty
to
see
that
they
do
n't
get
away
from
here
till
we
've
looked
*NL*
into
this
thing

Come
along

Hines
;
come
along
,
the
rest
of
you

We
'll
*NL*
take
these
fellows
to
the
tavern
and
affront
them
with
t
`
other
couple
,
*NL*
and
I
reckon
we
'll
find
out
_
something
_
before
we
get
through
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
nuts
for
the
crowd
,
though
maybe
not
for
the
king
's
friends
;
so
*NL*
we
all
started
.
It
was
about
sundown
.
The
doctor
he
led
me
along
by
*NL*
the
hand
,
and
was
plenty
kind
enough
,
but
he
never
let
go
my
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
all
got
in
a
big
room
in
the
hotel
,
and
lit
up
some
candles
,
and
*NL*
fetched
in
the
new
couple
.
First
,
the
doctor
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
wish
to
be
too
hard
on
these
two
men
,
but
I
think
they
're
*NL*
frauds
,
and
they
may
have
complices
that
we
do
n't
know
nothing
about
.
*NL*
If
they
have
,
wo
n't
the
complices
get
away
with
that
bag
of
gold
Peter
*NL*
Wilks
left
?
It
ai
n't
unlikely
.
If
these
men
ai
n't
frauds
,
they
wo
n't
*NL*
object
to
sending
for
that
money
and
letting
us
keep
it
till
they
*NL*
prove
they
're
all
right
--
ai
n't
that
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Everybody
agreed
to
that
.
So
I
judged
they
had
our
gang
in
a
pretty
*NL*
tight
place
right
at
the
outstart
.
But
the
king
he
only
looked
*NL*
sorrowful
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
I
wish
the
money
was
there
,
for
I
ai
n't
got
no
disposition
*NL*
to
throw
anything
in
the
way
of
a
fair
,
open
,
out-and-out
*NL*
investigation
o
'
this
misable
business
;
but
,
alas
,
the
money
ai
n't
*NL*
there
;
you
k
'n
send
and
see
,
if
you
want
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
it
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
when
my
niece
give
it
to
me
to
keep
for
her
I
took
and
hid
it
*NL*
inside
o
'
the
straw
tick
o
'
my
bed
,
not
wishin
'
to
bank
it
for
the
few
*NL*
days
we
'd
be
here
,
and
considerin
'
the
bed
a
safe
place
,
we
not
bein

*NL*
used
to
niggers
,
and
suppos
'n'
'em
honest
,
like
servants
in
England
.
*NL*
The
niggers
stole
it
the
very
next
mornin
'
after
I
had
went
*NL*
down-stairs
;
and
when
I
sold
'em
I
had
n't
missed
the
money
yit
,
so
*NL*
they
got
clean
away
with
it
.
My
servant
here
k
'n
tell
you
`
bout
it
,
*NL*
gentlemen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
and
several
said
``
Shucks
!
''
and
I
see
nobody
did
n't
*NL*
altogether
believe
him
.
One
man
asked
me
if
I
see
the
niggers
steal
*NL*
it
.
I
said
no
,
but
I
see
them
sneaking
out
of
the
room
and
hustling
*NL*
away
,
and
I
never
thought
nothing
,
only
I
reckoned
they
was
afraid
*NL*
they
had
waked
up
my
master
and
was
trying
to
get
away
before
he
made
*NL*
trouble
with
them
.
That
was
all
they
asked
me
.
Then
the
doctor
whirls
*NL*
on
me
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
_
you
_
English
,
too
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
says
yes
;
and
him
and
some
others
laughed
,
and
said
,
``
Stuff
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
then
they
sailed
in
on
the
general
investigation
,
and
there
we
*NL*
had
it
,
up
and
down
,
hour
in
,
hour
out
,
and
nobody
never
said
a
word
*NL*
about
supper
,
nor
ever
seemed
to
think
about
it
--
and
so
they
kept
it
*NL*
up
,
and
kept
it
up
;
and
it
_
was
_
the
worst
mixed-up
thing
you
ever
*NL*
see
.
They
made
the
king
tell
his
yarn
,
and
they
made
the
old
gentleman
*NL*
tell
his
`
n
;
and
anybody
but
a
lot
of
prejudiced
chuckleheads
would
`
a
'
*NL*
_
seen
_
that
the
old
gentleman
was
spinning
truth
and
t
`
other
one
lies
.
*NL*
And
by
and
by
they
had
me
up
to
tell
what
I
knowed
.
The
king
he
give
*NL*
me
a
left-handed
look
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
,
and
so
I
knowed
*NL*
enough
to
talk
on
the
right
side
.
I
begun
to
tell
about
Sheffield
,
and
*NL*
how
we
lived
there
,
and
all
about
the
English
Wilkses
,
and
so
on
;
but
*NL*
I
did
n't
get
pretty
fur
till
the
doctor
begun
to
laugh
;
and
Levi
Bell
,
*NL*
the
lawyer
,
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Set
down
,
my
boy
;
I
would
n't
strain
myself
if
I
was
you
.
I
reckon
you
*NL*
ai
n't
used
to
lying
,
it
do
n't
seem
to
come
handy
;
what
you
want
is
*NL*
practice
.
You
do
it
pretty
awkward
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
n't
care
nothing
for
the
compliment
,
but
I
was
glad
to
be
let
*NL*
off
,
anyway
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
he
started
to
say
something
,
and
turns
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
'd
been
in
town
at
first
,
Levi
Bell
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
king
broke
in
and
reached
out
his
hand
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
is
this
my
poor
dead
brother
's
old
friend
that
he
's
wrote
so
*NL*
often
about
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
lawyer
and
him
shook
hands
,
and
the
lawyer
smiled
and
looked
*NL*
pleased
,
and
they
talked
right
along
awhile
,
and
then
got
to
one
side
*NL*
and
talked
low
;
and
at
last
the
lawyer
speaks
up
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
'll
fix
it
.
I
'll
take
the
order
and
send
it
,
along
with
your
*NL*
brother
's
,
and
then
they
'll
know
it
's
all
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
they
got
some
paper
and
a
pen
,
and
the
king
he
set
down
and
twisted
*NL*
his
head
to
one
side
,
and
chawed
his
tongue
,
and
scrawled
off
*NL*
something
;
and
then
they
give
the
pen
to
the
duke
--
and
then
for
the
*NL*
first
time
the
duke
looked
sick
.
But
he
took
the
pen
and
wrote
.
So
*NL*
then
the
lawyer
turns
to
the
new
old
gentleman
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
and
your
brother
please
write
a
line
or
two
and
sign
your
names
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
gentleman
wrote
,
but
nobody
could
n't
read
it
.
The
lawyer
*NL*
looked
powerful
astonished
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
beats
_
me
_
--
and
snaked
a
lot
of
old
letters
out
of
his
*NL*
pocket
,
and
examined
them
,
and
then
examined
the
old
man
's
writing
,
*NL*
and
then
_
them
_
again
;
and
then
says
:
``
These
old
letters
is
from
*NL*
Harvey
Wilks
;
and
here
's
_
these
_
two
handwritings

anybody
can
see
*NL*
_
they
_
did
n't
write
them

-LRB-
the
king
and
the
duke
looked
sold
and
*NL*
foolish
,
I
tell
you
,
to
see
how
the
lawyer
had
took
them
in
-RRB-
,
``
and
*NL*
here
's
_
this

old

anybody
can
tell

easy

enough

he
_
did
n't
write
them

fact
is
,
the
scratches
he
makes
ai
n't
*NL*
properly

at
all

Now
,
here
's
some
letters
from

*NL*
*NL*
The
new
old
gentleman
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
please
,
let
me
explain
.
Nobody
can
read
my
hand

my

there

so
he
copies
for
me
.
It
's
_
his
_
hand
you
've
got
there
,
not
*NL*
mine

''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Well
!
_
''
says
the
lawyer
,
``
this
_
is
_
a
state
of
things

I
've
got
some
*NL*
of
William
's
letters
,
too
;
so
if
you
'll
get
him
to
write
a
line
or
so
*NL*
we
can
com
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
_
ca
n't
_
write
with
his
left
hand
,
''
says
the
old
gentleman
.
``
If
he
*NL*
could
use
his
right
hand
,
you
would
see
that
he
wrote
his

mine
too
.
Look
at
both
,
please
--
they
're
by
the
same
hand

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
lawyer
done
it
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
it
's
so
--
and
if
it
ai
n't
so
,
there
's
a
heap
stronger

resemblance
than
I
'd
noticed
before
,
anyway

Well
,
well
,
well
!
I
*NL*
thought
we
was
right
on
the
track
of
a
slution
,
but
it
's
gone
to
*NL*
grass
,
partly
.
But
anyway
,
_
one
_
thing
is
proved
--
_
these
_
two
ai
n't
*NL*
either
of
'em
Wilkses
''
--
and
he
wagged
his
head
towards
the
king
and
*NL*
the
duke
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
what
do
you
think
?
That
mule-headed
old
fool
would
n't
give
in
*NL*
_
then
!
_
Indeed
he
would
n't
.
Said
it
war
n't
no
fair
test
.
Said
his
*NL*
brother
William
was
the
cussedest
joker
in
the
world
,
and
had
n't
*NL*
_
tried
_
to
write
--
_
he
_
see
William
was
going
to
play
one
of
his
jokes
*NL*
the
minute
he
put
the
pen
to
paper
.
And
so
he
warmed
up
and
went
*NL*
warbling
right
along
till
he
was
actuly
beginning
to
believe
what
he
*NL*
was
saying
_
himself
_
;
but
pretty
soon
the
new
gentleman
broke
in
,
and
*NL*
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
thought
of
something
.
Is
there
anybody
here
that
helped
to
lay
*NL*
out
my

helped
to
lay
out
the
late
Peter
Wilks
for
burying

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
says
somebody
,
``
me
and
Ab
Turner
done
it
.
We
're
both
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
old
man
turns
toward
the
king
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Peraps
this
gentleman
can
tell
me
what
was
tattooed
on
his
breast
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Blamed
if
the
king
did
n't
have
to
brace
up
mighty
quick
,
or
he
'd
`
a
'
*NL*
squshed
down
like
a
bluff
bank
that
the
river
has
cut
under
,
it
took
*NL*
him
so
sudden
;
and
,
mind
you
,
it
was
a
thing
that
was
calculated
to
*NL*
make
most
_
anybody
_
sqush
to
get
fetched
such
a
solid
one
as
that
*NL*
without
any
notice
,
because
how
was
_
he
_
going
to
know
what
was
*NL*
tattooed
on
the
man
?
He
whitened
a
little
;
he
could
n't
help
it
;
and
*NL*
it
was
mighty
still
in
there
,
and
everybody
bending
a
little
forwards
*NL*
and
gazing
at
him
.
Says
I
to
myself
,
_
Now
_
he
'll
throw
up
the
*NL*
sponge
--
there
ai
n't
no
more
use
.
Well
,
did
he
?
A
body
ca
n't
hardly
*NL*
believe
it
,
but
he
did
n't
.
I
reckon
he
thought
he
'd
keep
the
thing
up
*NL*
till
he
tired
them
people
out
,
so
they
'd
thin
out
,
and
him
and
the
*NL*
duke
could
break
loose
and
get
away
.
Anyway
,
he
set
there
,
and
pretty
*NL*
soon
he
begun
to
smile
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mf
!
It
's
a
_
very
_
tough
question

_
ai
n't
_
it

_
Yes
_
,
sir
,
I
k
'n
tell
*NL*
you
what
's
tattooed
on
his
breast
.
It
's
jest
a
small
,
thin
,
blue
*NL*
arrow
--
that
's
what
it
is
;
and
if
you
do
n't
look
clost
,
you
ca
n't
see
*NL*
it
.
_
Now
_
what
do
you
say
--
hey
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
_
I
_
never
see
anything
like
that
old
blister
for
clean
*NL*
out-and-out
cheek
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
new
old
gentleman
turns
brisk
towards
Ab
Turner
and
his
pard
,
and
*NL*
his
eye
lights
up
like
he
judged
he
'd
got
the
king
_
this
_
time
,
and
*NL*
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
--
you
've
heard
what
he
said
!
Was
there
any
such
mark
on
Peter
*NL*
Wilks
's
breast
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Both
of
them
spoke
up
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
did
n't
see
no
such
mark
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
!
''
says
the
old
gentleman
.
``
Now
,
what
you
_
did
_
see
on
his
breast
*NL*
was
a
small
dim
P
,
and
a
B
-LRB-
which
is
an
initial
he
dropped
when
he
was
*NL*
young
-RRB-
,
and
a
W
,
and
dashes
between
them
,
so
:
P
--
B
--
W
''
--
and
he
marked
*NL*
them
that
way
on
a
piece
of
paper
.
``
Come
,
ai
n't
that
what
you
saw
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Both
of
them
spoke
up
again
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
we
_
did
n't
_
.
We
never
seen
any
marks
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
everybody
_
was
_
in
a
state
of
mind
now
,
and
they
sings
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
whole
_
bilin
'
_
of
'm
's
frauds
!
Le
's
duck
'em
!
le
's
drown
'em
!
*NL*
le
's
ride
'em
on
a
rail
!
''
and
everybody
was
whooping
at
once
,
and
*NL*
there
was
a
rattling
powwow
.
But
the
lawyer
he
jumps
on
the
table
and
*NL*
yells
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
--
gentle_men
!
_
Hear
me
just
a
word
--
just
a
_
single
_
word
--
if
*NL*
you
PLEASE
!
There
's
one
way
yet
--
let
's
go
and
dig
up
the
corpse
and
*NL*
look
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
took
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hooray
!
''
they
all
shouted
,
and
was
starting
right
off
;
but
the
lawyer
*NL*
and
the
doctor
sung
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
on
,
hold
on
!
Collar
all
these
four
men
and
the
boy
,
and
fetch
*NL*
_
them
_
along
,
too
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
do
it
!
''
they
all
shouted
;
``
and
if
we
do
n't
find
them
marks
*NL*
we
'll
lynch
the
whole
gang
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
_
was
_
scared
,
now
,
I
tell
you
.
But
there
war
n't
no
getting
away
,
you
*NL*
know
.
They
gripped
us
all
,
and
marched
us
right
along
,
straight
for
*NL*
the
graveyard
,
which
was
a
mile
and
a
half
down
the
river
,
and
the
*NL*
whole
town
at
our
heels
,
for
we
made
noise
enough
,
and
it
was
only
*NL*
nine
in
the
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
went
by
our
house
I
wished
I
had
n't
sent
Mary
Jane
out
of
town
;
*NL*
because
now
if
I
could
tip
her
the
wink
she
'd
light
out
and
save
me
,
*NL*
and
blow
on
our
dead-beats
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
we
swarmed
along
down
the
river
road
,
just
carrying
on
like
*NL*
wildcats
;
and
to
make
it
more
scary
the
sky
was
darking
up
,
and
the
*NL*
lightning
beginning
to
wink
and
flitter
,
and
the
wind
to
shiver
*NL*
amongst
the
leaves
.
This
was
the
most
awful
trouble
and
most
*NL*
dangersome
I
ever
was
in
;
and
I
was
kinder
stunned
;
everything
was
*NL*
going
so
different
from
what
I
had
allowed
for
;
stead
of
being
fixed
*NL*
so
I
could
take
my
own
time
if
I
wanted
to
,
and
see
all
the
fun
,
and
*NL*
have
Mary
Jane
at
my
back
to
save
me
and
set
me
free
when
the
*NL*
close-fit
come
,
here
was
nothing
in
the
world
betwixt
me
and
sudden
*NL*
death
but
just
them
tattoo-marks
.
If
they
did
n't
find
them
--
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
n't
bear
to
think
about
it
;
and
yet
,
somehow
,
I
could
n't
think
*NL*
about
nothing
else
.
It
got
darker
and
darker
,
and
it
was
a
beautiful
*NL*
time
to
give
the
crowd
the
slip
;
but
that
big
husky
had
me
by
the
*NL*
wrist
--
Hines
--
and
a
body
might
as
well
try
to
give
Goliar
the
slip
.
He
*NL*
dragged
me
right
along
,
he
was
so
excited
,
and
I
had
to
run
to
keep
*NL*
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
got
there
they
swarmed
into
the
graveyard
and
washed
over
it
*NL*
like
an
overflow
.
And
when
they
got
to
the
grave
they
found
they
had
*NL*
about
a
hundred
times
as
many
shovels
as
they
wanted
,
but
nobody
*NL*
had
n't
thought
to
fetch
a
lantern
.
But
they
sailed
into
digging
anyway
*NL*
by
the
flicker
of
the
lightning
,
and
sent
a
man
to
the
nearest
house
,
*NL*
a
half
a
mile
off
,
to
borrow
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
they
dug
and
dug
like
everything
;
and
it
got
awful
dark
,
and
the
*NL*
rain
started
,
and
the
wind
swished
and
swushed
along
,
and
the
*NL*
lightning
come
brisker
and
brisker
,
and
the
thunder
boomed
;
but
them
*NL*
people
never
took
no
notice
of
it
,
they
was
so
full
of
this
business
;
*NL*
and
one
minute
you
could
see
everything
and
every
face
in
that
big
*NL*
crowd
,
and
the
shovelfuls
of
dirt
sailing
up
out
of
the
grave
,
and
the
*NL*
next
second
the
dark
wiped
it
all
out
,
and
you
could
n't
see
nothing
at
*NL*
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
they
got
out
the
coffin
and
begun
to
unscrew
the
lid
,
and
then
*NL*
such
another
crowding
and
shouldering
and
shoving
as
there
was
,
to
*NL*
scrouge
in
and
get
a
sight
,
you
never
see
;
and
in
the
dark
,
that
way
,
*NL*
it
was
awful
.
Hines
he
hurt
my
wrist
dreadful
pulling
and
tugging
so
,
*NL*
and
I
reckon
he
clean
forgot
I
was
in
the
world
,
he
was
so
excited
and
*NL*
panting
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
of
a
sudden
the
lightning
let
go
a
perfect
sluice
of
white
glare
,
*NL*
and
somebody
sings
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
living
jingo
,
here
's
the
bag
of
gold
on
his
breast
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hines
let
out
a
whoop
,
like
everybody
else
,
and
dropped
my
wrist
and
*NL*
give
a
big
surge
to
bust
his
way
in
and
get
a
look
,
and
the
way
I
lit
*NL*
out
and
shinned
for
the
road
in
the
dark
there
ai
n't
nobody
can
tell
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
the
road
all
to
myself
,
and
I
fairly
flew
--
leastways
,
I
had
it
*NL*
all
to
myself
except
the
solid
dark
,
and
the
now-and-then
glares
,
and
*NL*
the
buzzing
of
the
rain
,
and
the
thrashing
of
the
wind
,
and
the
*NL*
splitting
of
the
thunder
;
and
sure
as
you
are
born
I
did
clip
it
*NL*
along
!
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
struck
the
town
I
see
there
war
n't
nobody
out
in
the
storm
,
so
*NL*
I
never
hunted
for
no
back
streets
,
but
humped
it
straight
through
the
*NL*
main
one
;
and
when
I
begun
to
get
towards
our
house
I
aimed
my
eye
and
*NL*
set
it
.
No
light
there
;
the
house
all
dark
--
which
made
me
feel
sorry
*NL*
and
disappointed
,
I
did
n't
know
why
.
But
at
last
,
just
as
I
was
*NL*
sailing
by
,
_
flash
_
comes
the
light
in
Mary
Jane
's
window
!
and
my
*NL*
heart
swelled
up
sudden
,
like
to
bust
;
and
the
same
second
the
house
*NL*
and
all
was
behind
me
in
the
dark
,
and
was
n't
ever
going
to
be
before
*NL*
me
no
more
in
this
world
.
She
_
was
_
the
best
girl
I
ever
see
,
and
had
*NL*
the
most
sand
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
minute
I
was
far
enough
above
the
town
to
see
I
could
make
the
*NL*
towhead
,
I
begun
to
look
sharp
for
a
boat
to
borrow
,
and
the
first
*NL*
time
the
lightning
showed
me
one
that
was
n't
chained
I
snatched
it
and
*NL*
shoved
.
It
was
a
canoe
,
and
war
n't
fastened
with
nothing
but
a
rope
.
*NL*
The
towhead
was
a
rattling
big
distance
off
,
away
out
there
in
the
*NL*
middle
of
the
river
,
but
I
did
n't
lose
no
time
;
and
when
I
struck
the
*NL*
raft
at
last
I
was
so
fagged
I
would
`
a
'
just
laid
down
to
blow
and
*NL*
gasp
if
I
could
afforded
it
.
But
I
did
n't
.
As
I
sprung
aboard
I
sung
*NL*
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Out
with
you
,
Jim
,
and
set
her
loose
!
Glory
be
to
goodness
,
we
're
*NL*
shut
of
them
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jim
lit
out
,
and
was
a-coming
for
me
with
both
arms
spread
,
he
was
so
*NL*
full
of
joy
;
but
when
I
glimpsed
him
in
the
lightning
my
heart
shot
up
*NL*
in
my
mouth
and
I
went
overboard
backwards
;
for
I
forgot
he
was
old
*NL*
King
Lear
and
a
drownded
A-rab
all
in
one
,
and
it
most
scared
the
*NL*
livers
and
lights
out
of
me
.
But
Jim
fished
me
out
,
and
was
going
to
*NL*
hug
me
and
bless
me
,
and
so
on
,
he
was
so
glad
I
was
back
and
we
was
*NL*
shut
of
the
king
and
the
duke
,
but
I
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
now
;
have
it
for
breakfast
,
have
it
for
breakfast
!
Cut
loose
and
*NL*
let
her
slide
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
in
two
seconds
away
we
went
a-sliding
down
the
river
,
and
it
_
did
_
*NL*
seem
so
good
to
be
free
again
and
all
by
ourselves
on
the
big
river
,
*NL*
and
nobody
to
bother
us
.
I
had
to
skip
around
a
bit
,
and
jump
up
and
*NL*
crack
my
heels
a
few
times
--
I
could
n't
help
it
;
but
about
the
third
*NL*
crack
I
noticed
a
sound
that
I
knowed
mighty
well
,
and
held
my
breath
*NL*
and
listened
and
waited
;
and
sure
enough
,
when
the
next
flash
busted
*NL*
out
over
the
water
,
here
they
come
!
--
and
just
a-laying
to
their
oars
*NL*
and
making
their
skiff
hum
!
It
was
the
king
and
the
duke
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
I
wilted
right
down
onto
the
planks
then
,
and
give
up
;
and
it
was
*NL*
all
I
could
do
to
keep
from
crying
.
*NL*

*NL*
CHAPTER
XXX
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
got
aboard
the
king
went
for
me
,
and
shook
me
by
the
collar
,
*NL*
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tryin
'
to
give
us
the
slip
,
was
ye
,
you
pup
!
Tired
of
our
company
,
*NL*
hey
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
your
majesty
,
we
war
n't
--
_
please
_
do
n't
,
your
majesty
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quick
,
then
,
and
tell
us
what
_
was
_
your
idea
,
or
I
'll
shake
the
*NL*
insides
out
o
'
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Honest
,
I
'll
tell
you
everything
just
as
it
happened
,
your
majesty
.
*NL*
The
man
that
had
a-holt
of
me
was
very
good
to
me
,
and
kept
saying
he
*NL*
had
a
boy
about
as
big
as
me
that
died
last
year
,
and
he
was
sorry
to
*NL*
see
a
boy
in
such
a
dangerous
fix
;
and
when
they
was
all
took
by
*NL*
surprise
by
finding
the
gold
,
and
made
a
rush
for
the
coffin
,
he
lets
*NL*
go
of
me
and
whispers
,
`
Heel
it
now
,
or
they
'll
hang
ye
,
sure
!
'
and
I
*NL*
lit
out
.
It
did
n't
seem
no
good
for
_
me
_
to
stay
--
I
could
n't
do
*NL*
nothing
,
and
I
did
n't
want
to
be
_
hung
_
if
I
could
get
away
.
So
I
*NL*
never
stopped
running
till
I
found
the
canoe
;
and
when
I
got
here
I
*NL*
told
Jim
to
hurry
,
or
they
'd
catch
me
and
hang
me
yet
,
and
said
I
was
*NL*
afeard
you
and
the
duke
was
n't
alive
now
,
and
I
was
awful
sorry
,
and
*NL*
so
was
Jim
,
and
was
awful
glad
when
we
see
you
coming
;
you
may
ask
Jim
*NL*
if
I
did
n't
.
''
Jim
said
it
was
so
;
and
the
king
told
him
to
shut
up
,
*NL*
and
said
,
``
Oh
,
yes
,
it
's
_
mighty
_
likely
!
''
and
shook
me
up
again
,
and
*NL*
said
he
reckoned
he
'd
drownd
me
.
But
the
duke
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leggo
the
boy
,
you
old
idiot
!
Would
_
you
_
`
a
'
done
any
different
?
*NL*
Did
you
inquire
around
for
_
him
_
when
you
got
loose
?
I
do
n't
remember
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
king
let
go
of
me
,
and
begun
to
cuss
that
town
and
everybody
in
*NL*
it
.
But
the
duke
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
better
a
blame
'
sight
give
_
yourself
_
a
good
cussing
,
for
you
're
*NL*
the
one
that
's
entitled
to
it
most
.
You
hai
n't
done
a
thing
from
the
*NL*
start
that
had
any
sense
in
it
,
except
coming
out
so
cool
and
cheeky
*NL*
with
that
imaginary
blue-arrow
mark
.
That
_
was
_
bright
--
it
was
right
*NL*
down
bully
;
and
it
was
the
thing
that
saved
us
.
For
if
it
had
n't
been
*NL*
for
that
they
'd
`
a
'
jailed
us
till
them
Englishmen
's
baggage
come
--
and
*NL*
then
--
the
penitentiary
,
you
bet
!
But
that
trick
took
'em
to
the
*NL*
graveyard
,
and
the
gold
done
us
a
still
bigger
kindness
;
for
if
the
*NL*
excited
fools
had
n't
let
go
all
holts
and
made
that
rush
to
get
a
look
*NL*
we
'd
`
a
'
slept
in
our
cravats
to-night
--
cravats
warranted
to
_
wear
_
,
*NL*
too
--
longer
than
_
we
'd
_
need
'em
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
was
still
a
minute
--
thinking
;
then
the
king
says
,
kind
of
*NL*
absent-minded
like
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mf
!
And
we
reckoned
the
_
niggers
_
stole
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
made
me
squirm
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
says
the
duke
,
kinder
slow
and
deliberate
and
sarcastic
,
''
_
we
_
*NL*
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
about
a
half
a
minute
the
king
drawls
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leastways
,
I
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
duke
says
,
the
same
way
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
contrary
,
_
I
_
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
king
kind
of
ruffles
up
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Looky
here
,
Bilgewater
,
what
'
r
you
referrin
'
to
?
''
The
duke
says
,
*NL*
pretty
brisk
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
it
comes
to
that
,
maybe
you
'll
let
me
ask
what
was
_
you
_
*NL*
referring
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shucks
!
''
says
the
king
,
very
sarcastic
;
``
but
_
I
_
do
n't
know
--
maybe
*NL*
you
was
asleep
,
and
did
n't
know
what
you
was
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
duke
bristles
up
now
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
let
_
up
_
on
this
cussed
nonsense

do
you
take
me
for

fool

Do

*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
It

--
and
the
duke
went
for
him
.
The
king
sings
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``

leggo

*NL*
The

says

*NL*
``

*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
The
duke
never
said
nothing
for
a
little
bit
;
then
he
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
king
began
to
gurgle
,
and
then
he
gasps
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Nough
!
--
I
_
own
up

_
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
very
glad
to
hear
him
say
that
;
it
made
me
feel
much
more
easier
*NL*
than
what
I
was
feeling
before
.
So
the
duke
took
his
hands
off
and
*NL*
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
ever
deny
it
again
I
'll
drown
you
.
It
's
_
well
_
for
you
to
set
*NL*
there
and
blubber
like
a
baby
--
it
's
fitten
for
you
,
after
the
way
*NL*
you
've
acted
.
I
never
see
such
an
old
ostrich
for
wanting
to
gobble
*NL*
everything
--
and
I
a-trusting
you
all
the
time
,
like
you
was
my
own
*NL*
father
.
You
ought
to
been
ashamed
of
yourself
to
stand
by
and
hear
it
*NL*
saddled
on
to
a
lot
of
poor
niggers
,
and
you
never
say
a
word
for
'em
.
*NL*
It
makes
me
feel
ridiculous
to
think
I
was
soft
enough
to
_
believe
_
*NL*
that
rubbage
.
Cuss
you
,
I
can
see
now
why
you
was
so
anxious
to
make
*NL*
up
the
deffisit
--
you
wanted
to
get
what
money
I
'd
got
out
of
the
*NL*
`
None-such
'
and
one
thing
or
another
,
and
scoop
it
_
all
!
_
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
king
says
,
timid
,
and
still
a-snuffling
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
duke
,
it
was
you
that
said
make
up
the
deffersit
;
it
war
n't
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dry
up
!
I
do
n't
want
to
hear
no
more
out
of
you
!
''
says
the
duke
.
``
And
*NL*
_
now
_
you
see
what
you
_
got
_
by
it
.
They
've
got
all
their
own
money
*NL*
back
,
and
all
of
_
ourn
_
but
a
shekel
or
two
_
besides
_
.
G'long
to
bed
,
*NL*
and
do
n't
you
deffersit
_
me
_
no
more
deffersits
,
long
's
_
you
_
live
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
king
sneaked
into
the
wigwam
and
took
to
his
bottle
for
*NL*
comfort
,
and
before
long
the
duke
tackled
_
his
_
bottle
;
and
so
in
*NL*
about
a
half
an
hour
they
was
as
thick
as
thieves
again
,
and
the
*NL*
tighter
they
got
the
lovinger
they
got
,
and
went
off
a-snoring
in
each
*NL*
other
's
arms
.
They
both
got
powerful
mellow
,
but
I
noticed
the
king
*NL*
did
n't
get
mellow
enough
to
forget
to
remember
to
not
deny
about
*NL*
hiding
the
money-bag
again
.
That
made
me
feel
easy
and
satisfied
.
Of
*NL*
course
when
they
got
to
snoring
we
had
a
long
gabble
,
and
I
told
Jim
*NL*
everything
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
XXXI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
We
das
n't
stop
again
at
any
town
for
days
and
days
;
kept
right
along
*NL*
down
the
river
.
We
was
down
south
in
the
warm
weather
now
,
and
a
*NL*
mighty
long
ways
from
home
.
We
begun
to
come
to
trees
with
Spanish
*NL*
moss
on
them
,
hanging
down
from
the
limbs
like
long
,
gray
beards
.
It
*NL*
was
the
first
I
ever
see
it
growing
,
and
it
made
the
woods
look
solemn
*NL*
and
dismal
.
So
now
the
frauds
reckoned
they
was
out
of
danger
,
and
*NL*
they
begun
to
work
the
villages
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
First
they
done
a
lecture
on
temperance
;
but
they
did
n't
make
enough
*NL*
for
them
both
to
get
drunk
on
.
Then
in
another
village
they
started
a
*NL*
dancing-school
;
but
they
did
n't
know
no
more
how
to
dance
than
a
*NL*
kangaroo
does
;
so
the
first
prance
they
made
the
general
public
jumped
*NL*
in
and
pranced
them
out
of
town
.
Another
time
they
tried
to
go
at
*NL*
yellocution
;
but
they
did
n't
yellocute
long
till
the
audience
got
up
*NL*
and
give
them
a
solid
good
cussing
,
and
made
them
skip
out
.
They
*NL*
tackled
missionarying
,
and
mesmerizing
,
and
doctoring
,
and
telling
*NL*
fortunes
,
and
a
little
of
everything
;
but
they
could
n't
seem
to
have
*NL*
no
luck
.
So
at
last
they
got
just
about
dead
broke
,
and
laid
around
*NL*
the
raft
as
she
floated
along
,
thinking
and
thinking
,
and
never
saying
*NL*
nothing
,
by
the
half
a
day
at
a
time
,
and
dreadful
blue
and
desperate
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
at
last
they
took
a
change
and
begun
to
lay
their
heads
together
*NL*
in
the
wigwam
and
talk
low
and
confidential
two
or
three
hours
at
a
*NL*
time
.
Jim
and
me
got
uneasy
.
We
did
n't
like
the
look
of
it
.
We
judged
*NL*
they
was
studying
up
some
kind
of
worse
deviltry
than
ever
.
We
turned
*NL*
it
over
and
over
,
and
at
last
we
made
up
our
minds
they
was
going
to
*NL*
break
into
somebody
's
house
or
store
,
or
was
going
into
the
*NL*
counterfeit-money
business
,
or
something
.
So
then
we
was
pretty
*NL*
scared
,
and
made
up
an
agreement
that
we
would
n't
have
nothing
in
the
*NL*
world
to
do
with
such
actions
,
and
if
we
ever
got
the
least
show
we
*NL*
would
give
them
the
cold
shake
and
clear
out
and
leave
them
behind
.
*NL*
Well
,
early
one
morning
we
hid
the
raft
in
a
good
,
safe
place
about
*NL*
two
mile
below
a
little
bit
of
a
shabby
village
named
Pikesville
,
and
*NL*
the
king
he
went
ashore
and
told
us
all
to
stay
hid
whilst
he
went
up
*NL*
to
town
and
smelt
around
to
see
if
anybody
had
got
any
wind
of
the
*NL*
``
Royal
Nonesuch
''
there
yet
.
-LRB-
``
House
to
rob
,
you
_
mean
_
,
''
says
I
to
*NL*
myself
;
``
and
when
you
get
through
robbing
it
you
'll
come
back
here
and
*NL*
wonder
what
has
become
of
me
and
Jim
and
the
raft
--
and
you
'll
have
to
*NL*
take
it
out
in
wondering
.
''
-RRB-
And
he
said
if
he
war
n't
back
by
midday
*NL*
the
duke
and
me
would
know
it
was
all
right
,
and
we
was
to
come
along
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
we
stayed
where
we
was
.
The
duke
he
fretted
and
sweated
around
,
and
*NL*
was
in
a
mighty
sour
way
.
He
scolded
us
for
everything
,
and
we
*NL*
could
n't
seem
to
do
nothing
right
;
he
found
fault
with
every
little
*NL*
thing
.
Something
was
a-brewing
,
sure
.
I
was
good
and
glad
when
midday
*NL*
come
and
no
king
;
we
could
have
a
change
,
anyway
--
and
maybe
a
chance
*NL*
for
_
the
_
chance
on
top
of
it
.
So
me
and
the
duke
went
up
to
the
*NL*
village
,
and
hunted
around
there
for
the
king
,
and
by
and
by
we
found
*NL*
him
in
the
back
room
of
a
little
low
doggery
,
very
tight
,
and
a
lot
of
*NL*
loafers
bullyragging
him
for
sport
,
and
he
a-cussing
and
a-threatening
*NL*
with
all
his
might
,
and
so
tight
he
could
n't
walk
,
and
could
n't
do
*NL*
nothing
to
them
.
The
duke
he
begun
to
abuse
him
for
an
old
fool
,
and
*NL*
the
king
begun
to
sass
back
,
and
the
minute
they
was
fairly
at
it
I
*NL*
lit
out
and
shook
the
reefs
out
of
my
hind
legs
,
and
spun
down
the
*NL*
river
road
like
a
deer
,
for
I
see
our
chance
;
and
I
made
up
my
mind
*NL*
that
it
would
be
a
long
day
before
they
ever
see
me
and
Jim
again
.
I
*NL*
got
down
there
all
out
of
breath
but
loaded
up
with
joy
,
and
sung
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Set
her
loose
,
Jim
;
we
're
all
right
now
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
war
n't
no
answer
,
and
nobody
come
out
of
the
wigwam
.
Jim
was
*NL*
gone
!
I
set
up
a
shout
--
and
then
another
--
and
then
another
one
;
and
*NL*
run
this
way
and
that
in
the
woods
,
whooping
and
screeching
;
but
it
*NL*
war
n't
no
use
--
old
Jim
was
gone
.
Then
I
set
down
and
cried
;
I
could
n't
*NL*
help
it
.
But
I
could
n't
set
still
long
.
Pretty
soon
I
went
out
on
the
*NL*
road
,
trying
to
think
what
I
better
do
,
and
I
run
across
a
boy
*NL*
walking
,
and
asked
him
if
he
'd
seen
a
strange
nigger
dressed
so
and
*NL*
so
,
and
he
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whereabouts
?
''
says
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Down
to
Silas
Phelps
's
place
,
two
mile
below
here
.
He
's
a
runaway
*NL*
nigger
,
and
they
've
got
him
.
Was
you
looking
for
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
bet
I
ai
n't
!
I
run
across
him
in
the
woods
about
an
hour
or
two
*NL*
ago
,
and
he
said
if
I
hollered
he
'd
cut
my
livers
out
--
and
told
me
to
*NL*
lay
down
and
stay
where
I
was
;
and
I
done
it

Been
there
ever
since
;
*NL*
afeard
to
come
out

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

he
says
,
``
you
need
n't
be
afeard
no
more

's

``
Well

I
_
reckon

There
's
two
hundred
dollars
dollars

's
like
picking
up
money
out

the
road

*NL*
``
Yes

sold
out
his
chance
in
him
*NL*
for
forty
dollars
,
becuz
he
's
got
to
go
up
the
river
and
ca
n't
wait
.
*NL*
Think
o

that
,
now
!
You
bet
_
I
'd
_
wait
,
if
it
was
seven
year
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
me
,
every
time

''
says
I.
``
But
maybe
his
chance

n't
worth
no

more

it

cheap

Maybe
there
's
something

straight
about

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
_
is
_
,
though
--
straight
as
a
string
.
I
see
the
handbill
myself
.
*NL*
It
tells
all
about
him
,
to
a
dot
--
paints
him
like
a
picture
,
and
tells
*NL*
the
plantation
he
's
frum

below

,

that
_
speculation
,

Say
,
gim

a
*NL*
chaw

,
wo
n't
ye
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
n't
have
none
,
so
he
left
.
I
went
to
the
raft
,
and
set
down
in
*NL*
the
wigwam
to
think
.
But
I
could
n't
come
to
nothing
.
I
thought
till
I
*NL*
wore
my
head
sore
,
but
I
could
n't
see
no
way
out
of
the
trouble
.
After
*NL*
all
this
long
journey
,
and
after
all
we
'd
done
for
them
scoundrels
,
*NL*
here
it
was
all
come
to
nothing
,
everything
all
busted
up
and
ruined
,
*NL*
because
they
could
have
the
heart
to
serve
Jim
such
a
trick
as
that
,
*NL*
and
make
him
a
slave
again
all
his
life
,
and
amongst
strangers
,
too
,
*NL*
for
forty
dirty
dollars
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
I
said
to
myself
it
would
be
a
thousand
times
better
for
Jim
to
*NL*
be
a
slave
at
home
where
his
family
was
,
as
long
as
he
'd
_
got
_
to
be
a
*NL*
slave
,
and
so
I
'd
better
write
a
letter
to
Tom
Sawyer
and
tell
him
to
*NL*
tell
Miss
Watson
where
he
was
.
But
I
soon
give
up
that
notion
for
two
*NL*
things
:
she
'd
be
mad
and
disgusted
at
his
rascality
and
ungratefulness
*NL*
for
leaving
her
,
and
so
she
'd
sell
him
straight
down
the
river
again
;
*NL*
and
if
she
did
n't
,
everybody
naturally
despises
an
ungrateful
nigger
,
*NL*
and
they
'd
make
Jim
feel
it
all
the
time
,
and
so
he
'd
feel
ornery
and
*NL*
disgraced
.
And
then
think
of
_
me
!
_
It
would
get
all
around
that
Huck
*NL*
Finn
helped
a
nigger
to
get
his
freedom
;
and
if
I
was
ever
to
see
*NL*
anybody
from
that
town
again
I
'd
be
ready
to
get
down
and
lick
his
*NL*
boots
for
shame
.
That
's
just
the
way
:
a
person
does
a
low-down
thing
,
*NL*
and
then
he
do
n't
want
to
take
no
consequences
of
it
.
Thinks
as
long
*NL*
as
he
can
hide
,
it
ai
n't
no
disgrace
.
That
was
my
fix
exactly
.
The
*NL*
more
I
studied
about
this
the
more
my
conscience
went
to
grinding
me
,
*NL*
and
the
more
wicked
and
low-down
and
ornery
I
got
to
feeling
.
And
at
*NL*
last
,
when
it
hit
me
all
of
a
sudden
that
here
was
the
plain
hand
of
*NL*
Providence
slapping
me
in
the
face
and
letting
me
know
my
wickedness
*NL*
was
being
watched
all
the
time
from
up
there
in
heaven
,
whilst
I
was
*NL*
stealing
a
poor
old
woman
's
nigger
that
had
n't
ever
done
me
no
harm
,
*NL*
and
now
was
showing
me
there
's
One
that
's
always
on
the
lookout
,
and
*NL*
ai
n't
a-going
to
allow
no
such
miserable
doings
to
go
only
just
so
fur
*NL*
and
no
further
,
I
most
dropped
in
my
tracks
I
was
so
scared
.
Well
,
I
*NL*
tried
the
best
I
could
to
kinder
soften
it
up
somehow
for
myself
by
*NL*
saying
I
was
brung
up
wicked
,
and
so
I
war
n't
so
much
to
blame
;
but
*NL*
something
inside
of
me
kept
saying
,
``
There
was
the
Sunday-school
,
you
*NL*
could
`
a
'
gone
to
it
;
and
if
you
'd
`
a
'
done
it
they
'd
`
a
'
learnt
you
*NL*
there
that
people
that
acts
as
I
'd
been
acting
about
that
nigger
goes
*NL*
to
everlasting
fire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
made
me
shiver
.
And
I
about
made
up
my
mind
to
pray
,
and
see
if
I
*NL*
could
n't
try
to
quit
being
the
kind
of
a
boy
I
was
and
be
better
.
So
I
*NL*
kneeled
down
.
But
the
words
would
n't
come
.
Why
would
n't
they
?
It
*NL*
war
n't
no
use
to
try
and
hide
it
from
Him
.
Nor
from
_
me
_
,
neither
.
I
*NL*
knowed
very
well
why
they
would
n't
come
.
It
was
because
my
heart
*NL*
war
n't
right
;
it
was
because
I
war
n't
square
;
it
was
because
I
was
*NL*
playing
double
.
I
was
letting
_
on
_
to
give
up
sin
,
but
away
inside
of
*NL*
me
I
was
holding
on
to
the
biggest
one
of
all
.
I
was
trying
to
make
my
*NL*
mouth
_
say
_
I
would
do
the
right
thing
and
the
clean
thing
,
and
go
and
*NL*
write
to
that
nigger
's
owner
and
tell
where
he
was
;
but
deep
down
in
*NL*
me
I
knowed
it
was
a
lie
,
and
He
knowed
it
.
You
ca
n't
pray
a
lie
--
I
*NL*
found
that
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
I
was
full
of
trouble
,
full
as
I
could
be
;
and
did
n't
know
what
to
*NL*
do
.
At
last
I
had
an
idea
;
and
I
says
,
I
'll
go
and
write
the
*NL*
letter
--
and
then
see
if
I
can
pray
.
Why
,
it
was
astonishing
,
the
way
I
*NL*
felt
as
light
as
a
feather
right
straight
off
,
and
my
troubles
all
*NL*
gone
.
So
I
got
a
piece
of
paper
and
a
pencil
,
all
glad
and
excited
,
*NL*
and
set
down
and
wrote
:
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Watson
,
your
runaway
nigger
Jim
is
down
here
two
mile
below
*NL*
Pikesville
,
and
Mr.
Phelps
has
got
him
and
he
will
give
him
up
for
the
*NL*
reward
if
you
send
.
HUCK
FINN
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
good
and
all
washed
clean
of
sin
for
the
first
time
I
had
ever
*NL*
felt
so
in
my
life
,
and
I
knowed
I
could
pray
now
.
But
I
did
n't
do
it
*NL*
straight
off
,
but
laid
the
paper
down
and
set
there
thinking
--
thinking
*NL*
how
good
it
was
all
this
happened
so
,
and
how
near
I
come
to
being
*NL*
lost
and
going
to
hell
.
And
went
on
thinking
.
And
got
to
thinking
over
*NL*
our
trip
down
the
river
;
and
I
see
Jim
before
me
all
the
time
:
in
the
*NL*
day
and
in
the
night-time
,
sometimes
moonlight
,
sometimes
storms
,
and
*NL*
we
a-floating
along
,
talking
and
singing
and
laughing
.
But
somehow
I
*NL*
could
n't
seem
to
strike
no
places
to
harden
me
against
him
,
but
only
*NL*
the
other
kind
.
I
'd
see
him
standing
my
watch
on
top
of
his
`
n
,
`
stead
*NL*
of
calling
me
,
so
I
could
go
on
sleeping
;
and
see
him
how
glad
he
was
*NL*
when
I
come
back
out
of
the
fog
;
and
when
I
come
to
him
again
in
the
*NL*
swamp
,
up
there
where
the
feud
was
;
and
such-like
times
;
and
would
*NL*
always
call
me
honey
,
and
pet
me
,
and
do
everything
he
could
think
of
*NL*
for
me
,
and
how
good
he
always
was
;
and
at
last
I
struck
the
time
I
*NL*
saved
him
by
telling
the
men
we
had
smallpox
aboard
,
and
he
was
so
*NL*
grateful
,
and
said
I
was
the
best
friend
old
Jim
ever
had
in
the
*NL*
world
,
and
the
_
only
_
one
he
's
got
now
;
and
then
I
happened
to
look
*NL*
around
and
see
that
paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
close
place
.
I
took
it
up
,
and
held
it
in
my
hand
.
I
was
*NL*
a-trembling
,
because
I
'd
got
to
decide
,
forever
,
betwixt
two
things
,
*NL*
and
I
knowed
it
.
I
studied
a
minute
,
sort
of
holding
my
breath
,
and
*NL*
then
says
to
myself
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
then
,
I
'll
_
go
_
to
hell
''
--
and
tore
it
up
.
It
was
awful
*NL*
thoughts
and
awful
words
,
but
they
was
said
.
And
I
let
them
stay
said
;
*NL*
and
never
thought
no
more
about
reforming
.
I
shoved
the
whole
thing
*NL*
out
of
my
head
,
and
said
I
would
take
up
wickedness
again
,
which
was
*NL*
in
my
line
,
being
brung
up
to
it
,
and
the
other
war
n't
.
And
for
a
*NL*
starter
I
would
go
to
work
and
steal
Jim
out
of
slavery
again
;
and
if
*NL*
I
could
think
up
anything
worse
,
I
would
do
that
,
too
;
because
as
long
*NL*
as
I
was
in
,
and
in
for
good
,
I
might
as
well
go
the
whole
hog
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
I
set
to
thinking
over
how
to
get
at
it
,
and
turned
over
some
*NL*
considerable
many
ways
in
my
mind
;
and
at
last
fixed
up
a
plan
that
*NL*
suited
me
.
So
then
I
took
the
bearings
of
a
woody
island
that
was
down
*NL*
the
river
a
piece
,
and
as
soon
as
it
was
fairly
dark
I
crept
out
with
*NL*
my
raft
and
went
for
it
,
and
hid
it
there
,
and
then
turned
in
.
I
slept
*NL*
the
night
through
,
and
got
up
before
it
was
light
,
and
had
my
*NL*
breakfast
,
and
put
on
my
store
clothes
,
and
tied
up
some
others
and
*NL*
one
thing
or
another
in
a
bundle
,
and
took
the
canoe
and
cleared
for
*NL*
shore
.
I
landed
below
where
I
judged
was
Phelps
's
place
,
and
hid
my
*NL*
bundle
in
the
woods
,
and
then
filled
up
the
canoe
with
water
,
and
*NL*
loaded
rocks
into
her
and
sunk
her
where
I
could
find
her
again
when
I
*NL*
wanted
her
,
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
below
a
little
steam-sawmill
*NL*
that
was
on
the
bank
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
I
struck
up
the
road
,
and
when
I
passed
the
mill
I
see
a
sign
on
*NL*
it
,
``
Phelps
's
Sawmill
,
''
and
when
I
come
to
the
farm-houses
,
two
or
*NL*
three
hundred
yards
further
along
,
I
kept
my
eyes
peeled
,
but
did
n't
*NL*
see
nobody
around
,
though
it
was
good
daylight
now
.
But
I
did
n't
mind
,
*NL*
because
I
did
n't
want
to
see
nobody
just
yet
--
I
only
wanted
to
get
the
*NL*
lay
of
the
land
.
According
to
my
plan
,
I
was
going
to
turn
up
there
*NL*
from
the
village
,
not
from
below
.
So
I
just
took
a
look
,
and
shoved
*NL*
along
,
straight
for
town
.
Well
,
the
very
first
man
I
see
when
I
got
*NL*
there
was
the
duke
.
He
was
sticking
up
a
bill
for
the
``
Royal
*NL*
Nonesuch
--
three-night
performance
--
like
that
other
time
.
They
had
the
*NL*
cheek
,
them
frauds
!
I
was
right
on
him
before
I
could
shirk
.
He
looked
*NL*
astonished
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hel
-
_
lo
!
_
Where
'd
_
you
_
come
from
?
''
Then
he
says
,
kind
of
glad
and
*NL*
eager
,
``
Where
's
the
raft
?
--
got
her
in
a
good
place
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
that
's
just
what
I
was
going
to
ask
your
grace
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
did
n't
look
so
joyful
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
was
your
idea
for
asking
_
me
?
_
''
he
says
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
I
says
,
``
when
I
see
the
king
in
that
doggery
yesterday
I
says
*NL*
to
myself
,
we
ca
n't
get
him
home
for
hours
,
till
he
's
soberer
;
so
I
*NL*
went
a-loafing
around
town
to
put
in
the
time
and
wait
.
A
man
up
and
*NL*
offered
me
ten
cents
to
help
him
pull
a
skiff
over
the
river
and
back
*NL*
to
fetch
a
sheep
,
and
so
I
went
along
;
but
when
we
was
dragging
him
to
*NL*
the
boat
,
and
the
man
left
me
a-holt
of
the
rope
and
went
behind
him
*NL*
to
shove
him
along
,
he
was
too
strong
for
me
and
jerked
loose
and
run
,
*NL*
and
we
after
him
.
We
did
n't
have
no
dog
,
and
so
we
had
to
chase
him
*NL*
all
over
the
country
till
we
tired
him
out
.
We
never
got
him
till
*NL*
dark
;
then
we
fetched
him
over
,
and
I
started
down
for
the
raft
.
When
*NL*
I
got
there
and
see
it
was
gone
,
I
says
to
myself
,
`
They
've
got
into
*NL*
trouble
and
had
to
leave
;
and
they
've
took
my
nigger
,
which
is
the
*NL*
only
nigger
I
've
got
in
the
world
,
and
now
I
'm
in
a
strange
country
,
*NL*
and
ai
n't
got
no
property
no
more
,
nor
nothing
,
and
no
way
to
make
my
*NL*
living
'
;
so
I
set
down
and
cried
.
I
slept
in
the
woods
all
night
.
But
*NL*
what
_
did
_
become
of
the
raft
,
then
?
--
and
Jim
--
poor
Jim
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Blamed
if
I
know
--
that
is
,
what
's
become
of
the
raft
.
That
old
fool
*NL*
had
made
a
trade
and
got
forty
dollars
,
and
when
we
found
him
in
the
*NL*
doggery
the
loafers
had
matched
half-dollars
with
him
and
got
every
*NL*
cent
but
what
he
'd
spent
for
whisky
;
and
when
I
got
him
home
late
last
*NL*
night
and
found
the
raft
gone
,
we
said
,
`
That
little
rascal
has
stole
*NL*
our
raft
and
shook
us
,
and
run
off
down
the
river
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
n't
shake
my
_
nigger
_
,
would
I
?
--
the
only
nigger
I
had
in
the
*NL*
world
,
and
the
only
property
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
never
thought
of
that
.
Fact
is
,
I
reckon
we
'd
come
to
consider
him
*NL*
_
our
_
nigger
;
yes
,
we
did
consider
him
so
--
goodness
knows
we
had
*NL*
trouble
enough
for
him
.
So
when
we
see
the
raft
was
gone
and
we
flat
*NL*
broke
,
there
war
n't
anything
for
it
but
to
try
the
`
Royal
Nonesuch
'
*NL*
another
shake
.
And
I
've
pegged
along
ever
since
,
dry
as
a
powder-horn
.
*NL*
Where
's
that
ten
cents
?
Give
it
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
considerable
money
,
so
I
give
him
ten
cents
,
but
begged
him
to
*NL*
spend
it
for
something
to
eat
,
and
give
me
some
,
because
it
was
all
*NL*
the
money
I
had
,
and
I
had
n't
had
nothing
to
eat
since
yesterday
.
He
*NL*
never
said
nothing
.
The
next
minute
he
whirls
on
me
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
reckon
that
nigger
would
blow
on
us
?
We
'd
skin
him
if
he
done
*NL*
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
he
blow
?
Hai
n't
he
run
off
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
That
old
fool
sold
him
,
and
never
divided
with
me
,
and
the
*NL*
money
's
gone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Sold
_
him
?
''
I
says
,
and
begun
to
cry
;
``
why
,
he
was
_
my
_
nigger
,
and
*NL*
that
was
my
money
.
Where
is
he
?
--
I
want
my
nigger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
ca
n't
_
get
_
your
nigger
,
that
's
all
--
so
dry
up
your
*NL*
blubbering
.
Looky
here
--
do
you
think
_
you
'd
_
venture
to
blow
on
us
?
*NL*
Blamed
if
I
think
I
'd
trust
you
.
Why
,
if
you
_
was
_
to
blow
on
us
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stopped
,
but
I
never
see
the
duke
look
so
ugly
out
of
his
eyes
*NL*
before
.
I
went
on
a-whimpering
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
to
blow
on
nobody
;
and
I
ai
n't
got
no
time
to
blow
,
*NL*
nohow
;
I
got
to
turn
out
and
find
my
nigger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
kinder
bothered
,
and
stood
there
with
his
bills
fluttering
*NL*
on
his
arm
,
thinking
,
and
wrinkling
up
his
forehead
.
At
last
he
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
something
.
We
got
to
be
here
three
days
.
If
you
'll
*NL*
promise
you
wo
n't
blow
,
and
wo
n't
let
the
nigger
blow
,
I
'll
tell
you
*NL*
where
to
find
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
I
promised
,
and
he
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
farmer
by
the
name
of
Silas
Ph
--
''
and
then
he
stopped
.
You
see
,
he
*NL*
started
to
tell
me
the
truth
;
but
when
he
stopped
that
way
,
and
begun
*NL*
to
study
and
think
again
,
I
reckoned
he
was
changing
his
mind
.
And
so
*NL*
he
was
.
He
would
n't
trust
me
;
he
wanted
to
make
sure
of
having
me
out
*NL*
of
the
way
the
whole
three
days
.
So
pretty
soon
he
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
man
that
bought
him
is
named
Abram
Foster
--
Abram
G.
Foster
--
and
*NL*
he
lives
forty
mile
back
here
in
the
country
,
on
the
road
to
*NL*
Lafayette
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
I
says
,
``
I
can
walk
it
in
three
days
.
And
I
'll
start
this
*NL*
very
afternoon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
you
wo
n't
,
you
'll
start
_
now
_
;
and
do
n't
you
lose
any
time
about
*NL*
it
,
neither
,
nor
do
any
gabbling
by
the
way
.
Just
keep
a
tight
tongue
*NL*
in
your
head
and
move
right
along
,
and
then
you
wo
n't
get
into
trouble
*NL*
with
_
us
_
,
d'ye
hear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
the
order
I
wanted
,
and
that
was
the
one
I
played
for
.
I
*NL*
wanted
to
be
left
free
to
work
my
plans
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
clear
out
,
''
he
says
;
``
and
you
can
tell
Mr.
Foster
whatever
you
*NL*
want
to
.
Maybe
you
can
get
him
to
believe
that
Jim
_
is
_
your
*NL*
nigger
--
some
idiots
do
n't
require
documents
--
leastways
I
've
heard
*NL*
there
's
such
down
South
here
.
And
when
you
tell
him
the
handbill
and
*NL*
the
reward
's
bogus
,
maybe
he
'll
believe
you
when
you
explain
to
him
*NL*
what
the
idea
was
for
getting
'em
out
.
Go
`
long
now
,
and
tell
him
*NL*
anything
you
want
to
;
but
mind
you
do
n't
work
your
jaw
any
_
between
_
*NL*
here
and
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
So
I
left
,
and
struck
for
the
back
country
.
I
did
n't
look
around
,
but
*NL*
I
kinder
felt
like
he
was
watching
me
.
But
I
knowed
I
could
tire
him
*NL*
out
at
that
.
I
went
straight
out
in
the
country
as
much
as
a
mile
*NL*
before
I
stopped
;
then
I
doubled
back
through
the
woods
towards
*NL*
Phelps
's
.
I
reckoned
I
better
start
in
on
my
plan
straight
off
without
*NL*
fooling
around
,
because
I
wanted
to
stop
Jim
's
mouth
till
these
*NL*
fellows
could
get
away
.
I
did
n't
want
no
trouble
with
their
kind
.
I
'd
*NL*
seen
all
I
wanted
to
of
them
,
and
wanted
to
get
entirely
shut
of
them
.

CHAPTER
XXXII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
got
there
it
was
all
still
and
Sunday-like
,
and
hot
and
*NL*
sunshiny
;
the
hands
was
gone
to
the
fields
;
and
there
was
them
kind
of
*NL*
faint
dronings
of
bugs
and
flies
in
the
air
that
makes
it
seem
so
*NL*
lonesome
and
like
everybody
's
dead
and
gone
;
and
if
a
breeze
fans
*NL*
along
and
quivers
the
leaves
it
makes
you
feel
mournful
,
because
you
*NL*
feel
like
it
's
spirits
whispering
--
spirits
that
's
been
dead
ever
so
*NL*
many
years
--
and
you
always
think
they
're
talking
about
_
you
.
_
As
a
*NL*
general
thing
it
makes
a
body
wish
_
he
_
was
dead
,
too
,
and
done
with
*NL*
it
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Phelps
's
was
one
of
these
little
one-horse
cotton
plantations
,
and
*NL*
they
all
look
alike
.
A
rail
fence
round
a
two-acre
yard
;
a
stile
made
*NL*
out
of
logs
sawed
off
and
up-ended
in
steps
,
like
barrels
of
a
*NL*
different
length
,
to
climb
over
the
fence
with
,
and
for
the
women
to
*NL*
stand
on
when
they
are
going
to
jump
onto
a
horse
;
some
sickly
*NL*
grass-patches
in
the
big
yard
,
but
mostly
it
was
bare
and
smooth
,
like
*NL*
an
old
hat
with
the
nap
rubbed
off
;
big
double
log
house
for
the
white
*NL*
folks
--
hewed
logs
,
with
the
chinks
stopped
up
with
mud
or
mortar
,
and
*NL*
these
mud-stripes
been
whitewashed
some
time
or
another
;
round-log
*NL*
kitchen
,
with
a
big
broad
,
open
but
roofed
passage
joining
it
to
the
*NL*
house
;
log
smokehouse
back
of
the
kitchen
;
three
little
nigger
cabins
*NL*
in
a
row
t
`
other
side
the
smokehouse
;
one
little
hut
all
by
itself
*NL*
away
down
against
the
back
fence
,
and
some
outbuildings
down
a
piece
*NL*
the
other
side
;
ash-hopper
and
big
kettle
to
bile
soap
in
by
the
*NL*
little
hut
;
bench
by
the
kitchen
door
,
with
bucket
of
water
and
a
*NL*
gourd
;
hound
asleep
there
in
the
sun
;
more
hounds
asleep
round
about
;
*NL*
about
three
shade
trees
away
off
in
a
corner
;
some
currant
bushes
and
*NL*
gooseberry
bushes
in
one
place
by
the
fence
;
outside
of
the
fence
a
*NL*
garden
and
a
watermelon
patch
;
then
the
cotton-fields
begins
,
and
*NL*
after
the
fields
the
woods
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
around
and
clumb
over
the
back
stile
by
the
ash-hopper
,
and
*NL*
started
for
the
kitchen
.
When
I
got
a
little
ways
I
heard
the
dim
hum
*NL*
of
a
spinning-wheel
wailing
along
up
and
sinking
along
down
again
;
and
*NL*
then
I
knowed
for
certain
I
wished
I
was
dead
--
for
that
_
is
_
the
*NL*
lonesomest
sound
in
the
whole
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
right
along
,
not
fixing
up
any
particular
plan
,
but
just
*NL*
trusting
to
Providence
to
put
the
right
words
in
my
mouth
when
the
*NL*
time
come
;
for
I
'd
noticed
that
Providence
always
did
put
the
right
*NL*
words
in
my
mouth
if
I
left
it
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
got
half-way
,
first
one
hound
and
then
another
got
up
and
went
*NL*
for
me
,
and
of
course
I
stopped
and
faced
them
,
and
kept
still
.
And
*NL*
such
another
powwow
as
they
made
!
In
a
quarter
of
a
minute
I
was
a
*NL*
kind
of
a
hub
of
a
wheel
,
as
you
may
say
--
spokes
made
out
of
*NL*
dogs
--
circle
of
fifteen
of
them
packed
together
around
me
,
with
their
*NL*
necks
and
noses
stretched
up
towards
me
,
a-barking
and
howling
;
and
*NL*
more
a-coming
;
you
could
see
them
sailing
over
fences
and
around
*NL*
corners
from
every-wheres
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
nigger
woman
come
tearing
out
of
the
kitchen
with
a
rolling-pin
in
*NL*
her
hand
,
singing
out
,
``
Begone
!
_
you
_
Tige
!
you
Spot
!
begone
sah
!
''
and
*NL*
she
fetched
first
one
and
then
another
of
them
a
clip
and
sent
them
*NL*
howling
,
and
then
the
rest
followed
;
and
the
next
second
half
of
them
*NL*
come
back
,
wagging
their
tails
around
me
,
and
making
friends
with
me
.
*NL*
There
ai
n't
no
harm
in
a
hound
,
nohow
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
behind
the
woman
comes
a
little
nigger
girl
and
two
little
nigger
*NL*
boys
without
anything
on
but
tow-linen
shirts
,
and
they
hung
on
to
*NL*
their
mother
's
gown
,
and
peeped
out
from
behind
her
at
me
,
bashful
,
*NL*
the
way
they
always
do
.
And
here
comes
the
white
woman
running
from
*NL*
the
house
,
about
forty-five
or
fifty
year
old
,
bareheaded
,
and
her
*NL*
spinning-stick
in
her
hand
;
and
behind
her
comes
her
little
white
*NL*
children
,
acting
the
same
way
the
little
niggers
was
going
.
She
was
*NL*
smiling
all
over
so
she
could
hardly
stand
--
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
_
you
_
,
at
last
!
--
_
ai
n't
_
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
out
with
a
``
Yes
'm
''
before
I
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
grabbed
me
and
hugged
me
tight
;
and
then
gripped
me
by
both
hands
*NL*
and
shook
and
shook
;
and
the
tears
come
in
her
eyes
,
and
run
down
*NL*
over
;
and
she
could
n't
seem
to
hug
and
shake
enough
,
and
kept
saying
,
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
look
as
much
like
your
mother
as
I
reckoned
you
would
;
but
*NL*
law
sakes
,
I
do
n't
care
for
that
,
I
'm
so
glad
to
see
you
!
Dear
,
dear
,
*NL*
it
does
seem
like
I
could
eat
you
up
!
Children
,
it
's
your
cousin
*NL*
Tom
!
--
tell
him
howdy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
they
ducked
their
heads
,
and
put
their
fingers
in
their
mouths
,
*NL*
and
hid
behind
her
.
So
she
run
on
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lize
,
hurry
up
and
get
him
a
hot
breakfast
right
away
--
or
did
you
get
*NL*
your
breakfast
on
the
boat
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
I
had
got
it
on
the
boat
.
So
then
she
started
for
the
house
,
*NL*
leading
me
by
the
hand
,
and
the
children
tagging
after
.
When
we
got
*NL*
there
she
set
me
down
in
a
split-bottomed
chair
,
and
set
herself
down
*NL*
on
a
little
low
stool
in
front
of
me
,
holding
both
of
my
hands
,
and
*NL*
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
I
can
have
a
_
good
_
look
at
you
;
and
,
laws-a-me
,
I
've
been
hungry
*NL*
for
it
a
many
and
a
many
a
time
,
all
these
long
years
,
and
it
's
come
*NL*
at
last
!
We
been
expecting
you
a
couple
of
days
and
more
.
What
kep
'
*NL*
you
?
--
boat
get
aground
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
'm
--
she
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
say
yes
'm
--
say
Aunt
Sally
.
Where
'd
she
get
aground
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
n't
rightly
know
what
to
say
,
because
I
did
n't
know
whether
the
*NL*
boat
would
be
coming
up
the
river
or
down
.
But
I
go
a
good
deal
on
*NL*
instinct
;
and
my
instinct
said
she
would
be
coming
up
--
from
down
*NL*
towards
Orleans
.
That
did
n't
help
me
much
,
though
;
for
I
did
n't
know
*NL*
the
names
of
bars
down
that
way
.
I
see
I
'd
got
to
invent
a
bar
,
or
*NL*
forget
the
name
of
the
one
we
got
aground
on
--
or
--
Now
I
struck
an
*NL*
idea
,
and
fetched
it
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
war
n't
the
grounding
--
that
did
n't
keep
us
back
but
a
little
.
We
*NL*
blowed
out
a
cylinder-head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
gracious
!
anybody
hurt
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
'm
.
Killed
a
nigger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
's
lucky
;
because
sometimes
people
do
get
hurt
.
Two
years
ago
*NL*
last
Christmas
your
uncle
Silas
was
coming
up
from
Newrleans
on
the
*NL*
old
Lally
Rook
,
and
she
blowed
out
a
cylinder-head
and
crippled
a
man
.
*NL*
And
I
think
he
died
afterwards
.
He
was
a
Baptist
.
Your
uncle
Silas
*NL*
knowed
a
family
in
Baton
Rouge
that
knowed
his
people
very
well
.
Yes
,
*NL*
I
remember
now
,
he
_
did
_
die
.
Mortification
set
in
,
and
they
had
to
*NL*
amputate
him
.
But
it
did
n't
save
him
.
Yes
,
it
was
mortification
--
that
*NL*
was
it
.
He
turned
blue
all
over
,
and
died
in
the
hope
of
a
glorious
*NL*
resurrection
.
They
say
he
was
a
sight
to
look
at
.
Your
uncle
's
been
up
*NL*
to
the
town
every
day
to
fetch
you
.
And
he
's
gone
again
,
not
more
'n
an
*NL*
hour
ago
;
he
'll
be
back
any
minute
now
.
You
must
`
a
'
met
him
on
the
*NL*
road
,
did
n't
you
?
--
oldish
man
,
with
a
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
did
n't
see
nobody
,
Aunt
Sally
.
The
boat
landed
just
at
*NL*
daylight
,
and
I
left
my
baggage
on
the
wharf-boat
and
went
looking
*NL*
around
the
town
and
out
a
piece
in
the
country
,
to
put
in
the
time
and
*NL*
not
get
here
too
soon
;
and
so
I
come
down
the
back
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
'd
you
give
the
baggage
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nobody
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
child
,
it
'll
be
stole
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
where
I
hid
it
I
reckon
it
wo
n't
,
''
I
says
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
'd
you
get
your
breakfast
so
early
on
the
boat
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
kinder
thin
ice
,
but
I
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
captain
see
me
standing
around
,
and
told
me
I
better
have
*NL*
something
to
eat
before
I
went
ashore
;
so
he
took
me
in
the
texas
to
*NL*
the
officers
'
lunch
,
and
give
me
all
I
wanted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
getting
so
uneasy
I
could
n't
listen
good
.
I
had
my
mind
on
the
*NL*
children
all
the
time
;
I
wanted
to
get
them
out
to
one
side
and
pump
*NL*
them
a
little
,
and
find
out
who
I
was
.
But
I
could
n't
get
no
show
,
*NL*
Mrs.
Phelps
kept
it
up
and
run
on
so
.
Pretty
soon
she
made
the
cold
*NL*
chills
streak
all
down
my
back
,
because
she
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
here
we
're
a-running
on
this
way
,
and
you
hai
n't
told
me
a
word
*NL*
about
Sis
,
nor
any
of
them
.
Now
I
'll
rest
my
works
a
little
,
and
you
*NL*
start
up
yourn
;
just
tell
me
_
everything
_
--
tell
me
all
about
'm
*NL*
all
--
every
one
of
'm
;
and
how
they
are
,
and
what
they
're
doing
,
and
*NL*
what
they
told
you
to
tell
me
;
and
every
last
thing
you
can
think
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
I
see
I
was
up
a
stump
--
and
up
it
good
.
Providence
had
stood
by
*NL*
me
this
fur
all
right
,
but
I
was
hard
and
tight
aground
now
.
I
see
it
*NL*
war
n't
a
bit
of
use
to
try
to
go
ahead
--
I
'd
got
to
throw
up
my
hand
.
*NL*
So
I
says
to
myself
,
here
's
another
place
where
I
got
to
resk
the
*NL*
truth
.
I
opened
my
mouth
to
begin
;
but
she
grabbed
me
and
hustled
me
*NL*
in
behind
the
bed
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
he
comes
!
Stick
your
head
down
lower
--
there
,
that
'll
do
;
you
*NL*
ca
n't
be
seen
now
.
Do
n't
you
let
on
you
're
here
.
I
'll
play
a
joke
on
*NL*
him
.
Children
,
do
n't
you
say
a
word
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
see
I
was
in
a
_
fix
_
now
.
But
it
war
n't
no
use
to
worry
;
there
*NL*
war
n't
nothing
to
do
but
just
hold
still
,
and
try
and
be
ready
to
*NL*
stand
from
under
when
the
lightning
struck
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
just
one
little
glimpse
of
the
old
gentleman
when
he
come
in
;
*NL*
then
the
bed
hid
him
.
Mrs.
Phelps
she
jumps
for
him
,
and
says
:
``
Has
he
*NL*
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
says
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
-
_
ness
_
gracious
!
''
she
says
,
``
what
in
the
world
_
can
_
have
become
*NL*
of
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
imagine
,
''
says
the
old
gentleman
;
``
and
I
must
say
it
makes
me
*NL*
dreadful
uneasy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Uneasy
!
''
she
says
;
``
I
'm
ready
to
go
distracted
!
He
_
must
_
`
a

come
;
*NL*
and
you
've
missed
him
along
the
road
.
I
_
know
_
it
's
so
--
something
*NL*
tells
me
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Sally
,
I
_
could
n't
_
miss
him
along
the
road
--
_
you
_
know
that

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
oh
,
dear
,
dear
,
what

Sis
say
!
He
must
`

come

You
must
*NL*
`

missed
him

He

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
n't
distress
me
any
more
'n
I
'm
already
distressed

I
do
n't
know
*NL*
what
in
the
world
to
make
of
it

I
'm
at
my
wit
's
end
,
and
I
do
n't
mind
*NL*
acknowledging
'
t
I
'm
right
down
scared
.
But
there
's
no
hope
that
he
's
*NL*
come
;
for
he
_
could
n't
_
come
and
me
miss
him
.
Sally
,
it
's
*NL*
terrible
--
just
terrible
--
something
's
happened
to
the
boat
,
sure
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Silas
!
Look
yonder
!
--
up
the
road
!
--
ai
n't
that
somebody
coming
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
sprung
to
the
window
at
the
head
of
the
bed
,
and
that
give
*NL*
Mrs.
Phelps
the
chance
she
wanted
.
She
stooped
down
quick
at
the
foot
*NL*
of
the
bed
and
give
me
a
pull
,
and
out
I
come
;
and
when
he
turned
back
*NL*
from
the
window
there
she
stood
,
a-beaming
and
a-smiling
like
a
house
*NL*
afire
,
and
I
standing
pretty
meek
and
sweaty
alongside
.
The
old
*NL*
gentleman
stared
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
who
's
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
do
you
reckon
't
is
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hai
n't
no
idea
.
Who
_
is
_
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
_
Tom
Sawyer
!
_
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
jings
,
I
most
slumped
through
the
floor
!
But
there
war
n't
no
time
*NL*
to
swap
knives
;
the
old
man
grabbed
me
by
the
hand
and
shook
,
and
kept
*NL*
on
shaking
;
and
all
the
time
how
the
woman
did
dance
around
and
laugh
*NL*
and
cry
;
and
then
how
they
both
did
fire
off
questions
about
Sid
,
and
*NL*
Mary
,
and
the
rest
of
the
tribe
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
if
they
was
joyful
,
it
war
n't
nothing
to
what
I
was
;
for
it
was
*NL*
like
being
born
again
,
I
was
so
glad
to
find
out
who
I
was
.
Well
,
they
*NL*
froze
to
me
for
two
hours
;
and
at
last
,
when
my
chin
was
so
tired
it
*NL*
could
n't
hardly
go
any
more
,
I
had
told
them
more
about
my
family
--
I
*NL*
mean
the
Sawyer
family
--
than
ever
happened
to
any
six
Sawyer
families
.
*NL*
And
I
explained
all
about
how
we
blowed
out
a
cylinder-head
at
the
*NL*
mouth
of
White
River
,
and
it
took
us
three
days
to
fix
it
.
Which
was
*NL*
all
right
,
and
worked
first-rate
;
because
_
they
_
did
n't
know
but
what
*NL*
it
would
take
three
days
to
fix
it
.
If
I
'd
`
a
'
called
it
a
bolthead
it
*NL*
would
`
a
'
done
just
as
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
I
was
feeling
pretty
comfortable
all
down
one
side
,
and
pretty
*NL*
uncomfortable
all
up
the
other
.
Being
Tom
Sawyer
was
easy
and
*NL*
comfortable
,
and
it
stayed
easy
and
comfortable
till
by
and
by
I
hear
*NL*
a
steamboat
coughing
along
down
the
river
.
Then
I
says
to
myself
,
*NL*
s
`
pose
Tom
Sawyer
comes
down
on
that
boat
?
And
s
`
pose
he
steps
in
*NL*
here
any
minute
,
and
sings
out
my
name
before
I
can
throw
him
a
wink
*NL*
to
keep
quiet
?
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
I
could
n't
_
have
_
it
that
way
;
it
would
n't
do
at
all
.
I
must
go
*NL*
up
the
road
and
waylay
him
.
So
I
told
the
folks
I
reckoned
I
would
go
*NL*
up
to
the
town
and
fetch
down
my
baggage
.
The
old
gentleman
was
for
*NL*
going
along
with
me
,
but
I
said
no
,
I
could
drive
the
horse
myself
,
*NL*
and
I
druther
he
would
n't
take
no
trouble
about
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
XXXIII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
So
I
started
for
town
in
the
wagon
,
and
when
I
was
half-way
I
see
a
*NL*
wagon
coming
,
and
sure
enough
it
was
Tom
Sawyer
,
and
I
stopped
and
*NL*
waited
till
he
come
along
.
I
says
``
Hold
on
!
''
and
it
stopped
alongside
,
*NL*
and
his
mouth
opened
up
like
a
trunk
,
and
stayed
so
;
and
he
swallowed
*NL*
two
or
three
times
like
a
person
that
's
got
a
dry
throat
,
and
then
*NL*
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hai
n't
ever
done
you
no
harm
.
You
know
that
.
So
,
then
,
what
you
*NL*
want
to
come
back
and
ha
`
nt
_
me
_
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hai
n't
come
back
--
I
hai
n't
been
_
gone
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
heard
my
voice
it
righted
him
up
some
,
but
he
war
n't
quite
*NL*
satisfied
yet
.
He
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
play
nothing
on
me
,
because
I
would
n't
on
you
.
Honest
*NL*
injun
,
you
ai
n't
a
ghost
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Honest
injun
,
I
ai
n't
,
''
I
says
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
I
--
I
--
well
,
that
ought
to
settle
it
,
of
course
;
but
I
ca
n't
*NL*
somehow
seem
to
understand
it
no
way
.
Looky
here
,
war
n't
you
ever
*NL*
murdered
_
at
all
?
_
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
I
war
n't
ever
murdered
at
all
--
I
played
it
on
them
.
You
come
in
*NL*
here
and
feel
of
me
if
you
do
n't
believe
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
done
it
;
and
it
satisfied
him
;
and
he
was
that
glad
to
see
me
*NL*
again
he
did
n't
know
what
to
do
.
And
he
wanted
to
know
all
about
it
*NL*
right
off
,
because
it
was
a
grand
adventure
,
and
mysterious
,
and
so
it
*NL*
hit
him
where
he
lived
.
But
I
said
,
leave
it
alone
till
by
and
by
;
and
*NL*
told
his
driver
to
wait
,
and
we
drove
off
a
little
piece
,
and
I
told
*NL*
him
the
kind
of
a
fix
I
was
in
,
and
what
did
he
reckon
we
better
do
?
*NL*
He
said
,
let
him
alone
a
minute
,
and
do
n't
disturb
him
.
So
he
thought
*NL*
and
thought
,
and
pretty
soon
he
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
right
;
I
've
got
it
.
Take
my
trunk
in
your
wagon
,
and
let
on
*NL*
it
's
your
`
n
;
and
you
turn
back
and
fool
along
slow
,
so
as
to
get
to
*NL*
the
house
about
the
time
you
ought
to
;
and
I
'll
go
towards
town
a
*NL*
piece
,
and
take
a
fresh
start
,
and
get
there
a
quarter
or
a
half
an
*NL*
hour
after
you
;
and
you
need
n't
let
on
to
know
me
at
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
;
but
wait
a
minute
.
There
's
one
more
thing
--
a
thing
that
*NL*
_
nobody
_
do
n't
know
but
me
.
And
that
is
,
there
's
a
nigger
here
that
*NL*
I
'm
a-trying
to
steal
out
of
slavery
,
and
his
name
is
_
Jim
_
--
old
Miss
*NL*
Watson
's
Jim
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
Why
,
Jim
is
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stopped
and
went
to
studying
.
I
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
I
_
know
what
you
'll
say
.
You
'll
say
it
's
dirty

low-down
business

*NL*
but
what
if
it
is
?
_
I
_
'm
low
down
;
and
I
'm
a-going
to
steal
him
,
and
I
*NL*
want
you
keep
mum
and
not
let
on
.
Will
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
eye
lit
up
,
and
he
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
_
help
_
you
steal
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
I
let
go
all
holts
then
,
like
I
was
shot
.
It
was
the
most
*NL*
astonishing
speech
I
ever
heard
--
and
I
'm
bound
to
say
Tom
Sawyer
fell
*NL*
considerable
in
my
estimation
.
Only
I
could
n't
believe
it
.
Tom
Sawyer
*NL*
a
_
nigger-stealer
!
_
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
shucks
!
''
I
says
;
``
you
're
joking

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ai
n't
joking

either

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
''
I
says
,
``
joking
or
no
joking
,
if
you
hear
anything
said
*NL*
about
a
runaway
nigger
,
do
n't
forget
to
remember
that
_
you
_
do
n't
know
*NL*
nothing
about
him
,
and
I
do
n't
know
nothing
about
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
took
the
trunk
and
put
it
in
my
wagon
,
and
he
drove
off
his
*NL*
way
and
I
drove
mine
.
But
of
course
I
forgot
all
about
driving
slow
on
*NL*
accounts
of
being
glad
and
full
of
thinking
;
so
I
got
home
a
heap
too
*NL*
quick
for
that
length
of
a
trip
.
The
old
gentleman
was
at
the
door
,
*NL*
and
he
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
this
is
wonderful
!
Whoever
would
`
a
'
thought
it
was
in
that
mare
*NL*
to
do
it
?
I
wish
we
'd
`
a
'
timed
her
.
And
she
hai
n't
sweated
a
*NL*
hair
--
not
a
hair
.
It
's
wonderful
.
Why
,
I
would
n't
take
a
hundred
*NL*
dollars
for
that
horse
now
--
I
would
n't
,
honest
;
and
yet
I
'd
`
a
'
sold
*NL*
her
for
fifteen
before
,
and
thought
't
was
all
she
was
worth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
's
all
he
said
.
He
was
the
innocentest
,
best
old
soul
I
ever
see
.
*NL*
But
it
war
n't
surprising
;
because
he
war
n't
only
just
a
farmer
,
he
was
*NL*
a
preacher
,
too
,
and
had
a
little
one-horse
log
church
down
back
of
*NL*
the
plantation
,
which
he
built
it
himself
at
his
own
expense
,
for
a
*NL*
church
and
schoolhouse
,
and
never
charged
nothing
for
his
preaching
,
*NL*
and
it
was
worth
it
,
too
.
There
was
plenty
other
farmer-preachers
like
*NL*
that
,
and
done
the
same
way
,
down
South
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
about
half
an
hour
Tom
's
wagon
drove
up
to
the
front
stile
,
and
*NL*
Aunt
Sally
she
see
it
through
the
window
,
because
it
was
only
about
*NL*
fifty
yards
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
there
's
somebody
come
!
I
wonder
who
't
is
?
Why
,
I
do
believe
it
's
*NL*
a
stranger
.
Jimmy
''
-LRB-
that
's
one
of
the
children
-RRB-
,
``
run
and
tell
Lize
to
*NL*
put
on
another
plate
for
dinner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Everybody
made
a
rush
for
the
front
door
,
because
,
of
course
,
a
*NL*
stranger
do
n't
come
_
every
_
year
,
and
so
he
lays
over
the
*NL*
yaller-fever
,
for
interest
,
when
he
does
come
.
Tom
was
over
the
stile
*NL*
and
starting
for
the
house
;
the
wagon
was
spinning
up
the
road
for
the
*NL*
village
,
and
we
was
all
bunched
in
the
front
door
.
Tom
had
his
store
*NL*
clothes
on
,
and
an
audience
--
and
that
was
always
nuts
for
Tom
Sawyer
.
*NL*
In
them
circumstances
it
war
n't
no
trouble
to
him
to
throw
in
an
*NL*
amount
of
style
that
was
suitable
.
He
war
n't
a
boy
to
meeky
along
up
*NL*
that
yard
like
a
sheep
;
no
,
he
come
ca
'm
and
important
,
like
the
ram
.
*NL*
When
he
got
a-front
of
us
he
lifts
his
hat
ever
so
gracious
and
*NL*
dainty
,
like
it
was
the
lid
of
a
box
that
had
butterflies
asleep
in
it
*NL*
and
he
did
n't
want
to
disturb
them
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Archibald
Nichols
,
I
presume
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
my
boy
,
''
says
the
old
gentleman
,
``
I
'm
sorry
to
say
'
t
your
driver
*NL*
has
deceived
you
;
Nichols
's
place
is
down
a
matter
of
three
mile
more
.
*NL*
Come
in
,
come
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
he
took
a
look
back
over
his
shoulder
,
and
says
,
``
Too
late
--
he
's
*NL*
out
of
sight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
he
's
gone
,
my
son
,
and
you
must
come
in
and
eat
your
dinner
with
*NL*
us
;
and
then
we
'll
hitch
up
and
take
you
down
to
Nichols
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
_
ca
n't
_
make
you
so
much
trouble
;
I
could
n't
think
of
it
.
I
'll
*NL*
walk
--
I
do
n't
mind
the
distance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
we
wo
n't
_
let
_
you
walk
--
it
would
n't
be
Southern
hospitality
to

do
it
.
Come
right
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
_
do

,
''
'
says
Aunt
Sally
;
``
it
ai
n't
a

It
's
a
long
,
dusty
three
mile
,
and
we
*NL*
ca
n't
let
you
walk

And
,
besides
,
I
've
already
told
'em
to
put
on
*NL*
another
plate
when
I
see
you
coming
;
so
you
must
n't
disappoint
us
.
*NL*
Come
right
in
and
make
yourself
at
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
Tom
he
thanked
them
very
hearty
and
handsome
,
and
let
himself
be
*NL*
persuaded
,
and
come
in
;
and
when
he
was
in
he
said
he
was
a
stranger
*NL*
from
Hicksville
,
Ohio
,
and
his
name
was
William
Thompson
--
and
he
made
*NL*
another
bow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
he
run
on
,
and
on
,
and
on
,
making
up
stuff
about
Hicksville
and
*NL*
everybody
in
it
he
could
invent
,
and
I
getting
a
little
nervious
,
and
*NL*
wondering
how
this
was
going
to
help
me
out
of
my
scrape
;
and
at
last
,
*NL*
still
talking
along
,
he
reached
over
and
kissed
Aunt
Sally
right
on
*NL*
the
mouth
,
and
then
settled
back
again
in
his
chair
comfortable
,
and
*NL*
was
going
on
talking
;
but
she
jumped
up
and
wiped
it
off
with
the
back
*NL*
of
her
hand
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
owdacious
puppy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
kind
of
hurt
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
surprised
at
you
,
m
`
am

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You

Why

I

a

notion
to
*NL*
take
and
--
Say
,
what
do
you
mean
by
kissing
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
kind
of
humble
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't

thought

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
born
fool
!
''
She
took
up
the
spinning-stick
,
and
it
looked
*NL*
like
it
was
all
she
could
do
to
keep
from
giving
him
a
crack
with
it
.
*NL*
``
What
made
you

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*

They

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

everybody

They
all
said
so

*NL*
*NL*
It
was
all
she
could
do
to
hold
in
;
and
her
eyes
snapped
,
and
her
*NL*
fingers
worked
like
she
wanted
to
scratch
him
;
and
she
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who

everybody

?
Out
with
their
names
,
or
ther
'll
be
an

*NL*

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
got
up
and
looked
distressed
,
and
fumbled
his
hat
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm

every

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

wo

*NL*
``

he
says

it
does

I

somehow

They
said

I
thought
you
would

But
--

He
*NL*
stopped
and
looked
around
slow
,
like
he
wished
he
could
run
across
a
*NL*
friendly
eye
somewheres
,
and
fetched
up
on
the
old
gentleman
's
,
and
*NL*
says
,
``

*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
looks
on
around
the
same
way
to
me
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My

she
says
,
breaking
in
and
jumping
for
him
,
``
you
impudent
*NL*
young
rascal

fool
a
body

and
was
going
to
hug
him

but
he
*NL*
fended
her
off
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

not

*NL*
*NL*
So
she
did
n't
lose
no
time
,
but
asked
him
;
and
hugged
him
and
kissed
*NL*
him
over
and
over
again
,
and
then
turned
him
over
to
the
old
man
,
and
*NL*
he
took
what
was
left
.
And
after
they
got
a
little
quiet
again
she
*NL*
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

I
never

such
a

at
all

only
Tom

Sis
never

about
anybody
coming

him

*NL*
*NL*
``
It

because
it

he
*NL*
says
;
``

I

begged

at

she
let

too

so
,
coming
down
the
river
,
me

Tom
thought
it
would
be
a
*NL*
first-rate
surprise
for
him
to
come
here
to
the
house
first
,
and
for
*NL*
me
to
by

by
tag
along
and
drop
in
,
and
let
on
to
be
a
stranger

*NL*
But
it
was
a
mistake
,
Aunt
Sally
.
This
ai
n't
no
healthy
place
for
a
*NL*
stranger
to
come

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

not
impudent

Sid

boxed

I

been

put
out

But
I
do
n't
care
,
I
*NL*
do
n't
mind
the
terms
--
I
'd
be
willing
to
stand
a
thousand
such
jokes
to
*NL*
have
you
here
.
Well
,
to
think
of
that
performance
!
I
do
n't
deny
it
,
I
*NL*
was
most
putrified
with
astonishment
when
you
give
me
that
smack
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
dinner
out
in
that
broad
open
passage
betwixt
the
house
and
the
*NL*
kitchen
;
and
there
was
things
enough
on
that
table
for
seven
*NL*
families
--
and
all
hot
,
too
;
none
of
your
flabby
,
tough
meat
that
's
*NL*
laid
in
a
cupboard
in
a
damp
cellar
all
night
and
tastes
like
a
hunk
*NL*
of
old
cold
cannibal
in
the
morning
.
Uncle
Silas
he
asked
a
pretty
*NL*
long
blessing
over
it
,
but
it
was
worth
it
;
and
it
did
n't
cool
it
a
*NL*
bit
,
neither
,
the
way
I
've
seen
them
kind
of
interruptions
do
lots
of
*NL*
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
considerable
good
deal
of
talk
all
the
afternoon
,
and
me
*NL*
and
Tom
was
on
the
lookout
all
the
time
;
but
it
war
n't
no
use
,
they
*NL*
did
n't
happen
to
say
nothing
about
any
runaway
nigger
,
and
we
was
*NL*
afraid
to
try
to
work
up
to
it
.
But
at
supper
,
at
night
,
one
of
the
*NL*
little
boys
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pa
,
may
n't
Tom
and
Sid
and
me
go
to
the
show
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
says
the
old
man
,
``
I
reckon
there
ai
n't
going
to
be
any
;
and
you
*NL*
could
n't
go
if
there
was
;
because
the
runaway
nigger
told
Burton
and
*NL*
me
all
about
that
scandalous
show
,
and
Burton
said
he
would
tell
the
*NL*
people
;
so
I
reckon
they
've
drove
the
owdacious
loafers
out
of
town
*NL*
before
this
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
there
it
was
!
--
but
_
I
_
could
n't
help
it
.
Tom
and
me
was
to
sleep
in
*NL*
the
same
room
and
bed
;
so
,
being
tired
,
we
bid
good
night
and
went
up
*NL*
to
bed
right
after
supper
,
and
clumb
out
of
the
window
and
down
the
*NL*
lightning-rod
,
and
shoved
for
the
town
;
for
I
did
n't
believe
anybody
*NL*
was
going
to
give
the
king
and
the
duke
a
hint
,
and
so
if
I
did
n't
*NL*
hurry
up
and
give
them
one
they
'd
get
into
trouble
sure
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
road
Tom
he
told
me
all
about
how
it
was
reckoned
I
was
*NL*
murdered
,
and
how
pap
disappeared
pretty
soon
,
and
did
n't
come
back
no
*NL*
more
,
and
what
a
stir
there
was
when
Jim
run
away
;
and
I
told
Tom
all
*NL*
about
our
``
Royal
Nonesuch
''
rapscallions
,
and
as
much
of
the
raft
*NL*
voyage
as
I
had
time
to
;
and
as
we
struck
into
the
town
and
up
through
*NL*
the
middle
of
it
--
it
was
as
much
as
half
after
eight
then
--
here
comes
*NL*
a
raging
rush
of
people
with
torches
,
and
an
awful
whooping
and
*NL*
yelling
,
and
banging
tin
pans
and
blowing
horns
;
and
we
jumped
to
one
*NL*
side
to
let
them
go
by
;
and
as
they
went
by
I
see
they
had
the
king
*NL*
and
the
duke
astraddle
of
a
rail
--
that
is
,
I
knowed
it
_
was
_
the
king
*NL*
and
the
duke
,
though
they
was
all
over
tar
and
feathers
,
and
did
n't
*NL*
look
like
nothing
in
the
world
that
was
human
--
just
looked
like
a
*NL*
couple
of
monstrous
big
soldier-plumes
.
Well
,
it
made
me
sick
to
see
*NL*
it
;
and
I
was
sorry
for
them
poor
pitiful
rascals
,
it
seemed
like
I
*NL*
could
n't
ever
feel
any
hardness
against
them
any
more
in
the
world
.
It
*NL*
was
a
dreadful
thing
to
see
.
Human
beings
_
can
_
be
awful
cruel
to
one
*NL*
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
see
we
was
too
late
--
could
n't
do
no
good
.
We
asked
some
stragglers
*NL*
about
it
,
and
they
said
everybody
went
to
the
show
looking
very
*NL*
innocent
;
and
laid
low
and
kept
dark
till
the
poor
old
king
was
in
the
*NL*
middle
of
his
cavortings
on
the
stage
;
then
somebody
give
a
signal
,
*NL*
and
the
house
rose
up
and
went
for
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
we
poked
along
back
home
,
and
I
war
n't
feeling
so
brash
as
I
was
*NL*
before
,
but
kind
of
ornery
,
and
humble
,
and
to
blame
,
somehow
--
though
*NL*
I
had
n't
done
nothing
.
But
that
's
always
the
way
;
it
do
n't
make
no
*NL*
difference
whether
you
do
right
or
wrong
,
a
person
's
conscience
ai
n't
*NL*
got
no
sense
,
and
just
goes
for
him
_
anyway
.
_
If
I
had
a
yaller
dog
*NL*
that
did
n't
know
no
more
than
a
person
's
conscience
does
I
would
pison
*NL*
him
.
It
takes
up
more
room
than
all
the
rest
of
a
person
's
insides
,
*NL*
and
yet
ai
n't
no
good
,
nohow
.

CHAPTER
XXXIV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
We
stopped
talking
,
and
got
to
thinking
.
By
and
by
Tom
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Looky
here
,
Huck
,
what
fools
we
are
to
not
think
of
it
before
!
I
bet
*NL*
I
know
where
Jim
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
Where
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
that
hut
down
by
the
ash-hopper
.
Why
,
looky
here
.
When
we
was
at
*NL*
dinner
,
did
n't
you
see
a
nigger
man
go
in
there
with
some
vittles
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
you
think
the
vittles
was
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
a
dog
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
'd
I.
Well
,
it
was
n't
for
a
dog
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
part
of
it
was
watermelon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
it
was
--
I
noticed
it
.
Well
,
it
does
beat
all
that
I
never
thought
*NL*
about
a
dog
not
eating
watermelon
.
It
shows
how
a
body
can
see
and
*NL*
do
n't
see
at
the
same
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
the
nigger
unlocked
the
padlock
when
he
went
in
,
and
he
locked
*NL*
it
again
when
he
came
out
.
He
fetched
uncle
a
key
about
the
time
we
*NL*
got
up
from
table
--
same
key
,
I
bet
.
Watermelon
shows
man
,
lock
shows
*NL*
prisoner
;
and
it
ai
n't
likely
there
's
two
prisoners
on
such
a
little
*NL*
plantation
,
and
where
the
people
's
all
so
kind
and
good
.
Jim
's
the
*NL*
prisoner
.
All
right
--
I
'm
glad
we
found
it
out
detective
fashion
;
I
*NL*
would
n't
give
shucks
for
any
other
way
.
Now
you
work
your
mind
,
and
*NL*
study
out
a
plan
to
steal
Jim
,
and
I
will
study
out
one
,
too
;
and
*NL*
we
'll
take
the
one
we
like
the
best
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
a
head
for
just
a
boy
to
have
!
If
I
had
Tom
Sawyer
's
head
I
*NL*
would
n't
trade
it
off
to
be
a
duke
,
nor
mate
of
a
steamboat
,
nor
clown
*NL*
in
a
circus
,
nor
nothing
I
can
think
of
.
I
went
to
thinking
out
a
*NL*
plan
,
but
only
just
to
be
doing
something
;
I
knowed
very
well
where
*NL*
the
right
plan
was
going
to
come
from
.
Pretty
soon
Tom
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ready
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
I
says
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
--
bring
it
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
plan
is
this
,
''
I
says
.
``
We
can
easy
find
out
if
it
's
Jim
in
there
.
*NL*
Then
get
up
my
canoe
to-morrow
night
,
and
fetch
my
raft
over
from
the
*NL*
island
.
Then
the
first
dark
night
that
comes
steal
the
key
out
of
the
*NL*
old
man
's
britches
after
he
goes
to
bed
,
and
shove
off
down
the
river
*NL*
on
the
raft
with
Jim
,
hiding
daytimes
and
running
nights
,
the
way
me
*NL*
and
Jim
used
to
do
before
.
Would
n't
that
plan
work
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Work
?
_
Why
,
cert
`
nly
it
would
work
,
like
rats
a-fighting
.
But
it
's
*NL*
too
blame
'
simple
;
there
ai
n't
nothing
_
to
_
it
.
What
's
the
good
of
a
*NL*
plan
that
ai
n't
no
more
trouble
than
that
?
It
's
as
mild
as
goose-milk
.
*NL*
Why
,
Huck
,
it
would
n't
make
no
more
talk
than
breaking
into
a
soap
*NL*
factory
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
never
said
nothing
,
because
I
war
n't
expecting
nothing
different
;
*NL*
but
I
knowed
mighty
well
that
whenever
he
got
_
his
_
plan
ready
it
*NL*
would
n't
have
none
of
them
objections
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
it
did
n't
.
He
told
me
what
it
was
,
and
I
see
in
a
minute
it
was
*NL*
worth
fifteen
of
mine
for
style
,
and
would
make
Jim
just
as
free
a
man
*NL*
as
mine
would
,
and
maybe
get
us
all
killed
besides
.
So
I
was
*NL*
satisfied
,
and
said
we
would
waltz
in
on
it
.
I
need
n't
tell
what
it
*NL*
was
here
,
because
I
knowed
it
would
n't
stay
the
way
it
was
.
I
knowed
*NL*
he
would
be
changing
it
around
every
which
way
as
we
went
along
,
and
*NL*
heaving
in
new
bullinesses
wherever
he
got
a
chance
.
And
that
is
what
*NL*
he
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
one
thing
was
dead
sure
,
and
that
was
that
Tom
Sawyer
was
in
*NL*
earnest
,
and
was
actuly
going
to
help
steal
that
nigger
out
of
*NL*
slavery
.
That
was
the
thing
that
was
too
many
for
me
.
Here
was
a
boy
*NL*
that
was
respectable
and
well
brung
up
;
and
had
a
character
to
lose
;
*NL*
and
folks
at
home
that
had
characters
;
and
he
was
bright
and
not
*NL*
leather-headed
;
and
knowing
and
not
ignorant
;
and
not
mean
,
but
kind
;
*NL*
and
yet
here
he
was
,
without
any
more
pride
,
or
rightness
,
or
feeling
,
*NL*
than
to
stoop
to
this
business
,
and
make
himself
a
shame
,
and
his
*NL*
family
a
shame
,
before
everybody
.
I
_
could
n't
_
understand
it
no
way
at
*NL*
all
.
It
was
outrageous
,
and
I
knowed
I
ought
to
just
up
and
tell
him
*NL*
so
;
and
so
be
his
true
friend
,
and
let
him
quit
the
thing
right
where
*NL*
he
was
and
save
himself
.
And
I
_
did
_
start
to
tell
him
;
but
he
shut
me
*NL*
up
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
reckon
I
know
what
I
'm
about
?
Do
n't
I
generly
know
what
*NL*
I
'm
about
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
n't
I
_
say
_
I
was
going
to
help
steal
the
nigger
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
's
all
he
said
,
and
that
's
all
I
said
.
It
war
n't
no
use
to
say
any
*NL*
more
;
because
when
he
said
he
'd
do
a
thing
,
he
always
done
it
.
But
I
*NL*
could
n't
make
out
how
he
was
willing
to
go
into
this
thing
;
so
I
just
*NL*
let
it
go
,
and
never
bothered
no
more
about
it
.
If
he
was
bound
to
*NL*
have
it
so
,
I
could
n't
help
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
got
home
the
house
was
all
dark
and
still
;
so
we
went
on
down
*NL*
to
the
hut
by
the
ash-hopper
for
to
examine
it
.
We
went
through
the
*NL*
yard
so
as
to
see
what
the
hounds
would
do
.
They
knowed
us
,
and
did
n't
*NL*
make
no
more
noise
than
country
dogs
is
always
doing
when
anything
*NL*
comes
by
in
the
night
.
When
we
got
to
the
cabin
we
took
a
look
at
the
*NL*
front
and
the
two
sides
;
and
on
the
side
I
war
n't
acquainted
*NL*
with
--
which
was
the
north
side
--
we
found
a
square
window-hole
,
up
*NL*
tolerable
high
,
with
just
one
stout
board
nailed
across
it
.
I
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
's
the
ticket
.
This
hole
's
big
enough
for
Jim
to
get
through
if
*NL*
we
wrench
off
the
board
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
as
simple
as
tit-tat-toe
,
three-in-a-row
,
and
as
easy
as
playing
*NL*
hooky
.
I
should
_
hope
_
we
can
find
a
way
that
's
a
little
more
*NL*
complicated
than
_
that
_
,
Huck
Finn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
''
I
says
,
``
how
'll
it
do
to
saw
him
out
,
the
way
I
done
*NL*
before
I
was
murdered
that
time
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
more
_
like
_
,
''
he
says
.
``
It
's
real
mysterious
,
and
troublesome
,
*NL*
and
good
,
''
he
says
;
``
but
I
bet
we
can
find
a
way
that
's
twice
as
long
.
*NL*
There
ai
n't
no
hurry
;
le
's
keep
on
looking
around
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Betwixt
the
hut
and
the
fence
,
on
the
back
side
,
was
a
lean-to
that
*NL*
joined
the
hut
at
the
eaves
,
and
was
made
out
of
plank
.
It
was
as
long
*NL*
as
the
hut
,
but
narrow
--
only
about
six
foot
wide
.
The
door
to
it
was
*NL*
at
the
south
end
,
and
was
padlocked
.
Tom
he
went
to
the
soap-kettle
*NL*
and
searched
around
,
and
fetched
back
the
iron
thing
they
lift
the
lid
*NL*
with
;
so
he
took
it
and
prized
out
one
of
the
staples
.
The
chain
fell
*NL*
down
,
and
we
opened
the
door
and
went
in
,
and
shut
it
,
and
struck
a
*NL*
match
,
and
see
the
shed
was
only
built
against
a
cabin
and
had
n't
no
*NL*
connection
with
it
;
and
there
war
n't
no
floor
to
the
shed
,
nor
nothing
*NL*
in
it
but
some
old
rusty
played-out
hoes
and
spades
and
picks
and
a
*NL*
crippled
plow
.
The
match
went
out
,
and
so
did
we
,
and
shoved
in
the
*NL*
staple
again
,
and
the
door
was
locked
as
good
as
ever
.
Tom
was
joyful
.
*NL*
He
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
we
're
all
right
.
We
'll
_
dig
_
him
out
.
It
'll
take
about
a
week
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
we
started
for
the
house
,
and
I
went
in
the
back
door
--
you
only
*NL*
have
to
pull
a
buckskin
latch-string
,
they
do
n't
fasten
the
doors
--
but
*NL*
that
war
n't
romantical
enough
for
Tom
Sawyer
;
no
way
would
do
him
but
*NL*
he
must
climb
up
the
lightning-rod
.
But
after
he
got
up
half-way
about
*NL*
three
times
,
and
missed
fire
and
fell
every
time
,
and
the
last
time
*NL*
most
busted
his
brains
out
,
he
thought
he
'd
got
to
give
it
up
;
but
*NL*
after
he
was
rested
he
allowed
he
would
give
her
one
more
turn
for
*NL*
luck
,
and
this
time
he
made
the
trip
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
we
was
up
at
break
of
day
,
and
down
to
the
nigger
*NL*
cabins
to
pet
the
dogs
and
make
friends
with
the
nigger
that
fed
*NL*
Jim
--
if
it
_
was
_
Jim
that
was
being
fed
.
The
niggers
was
just
getting
*NL*
through
breakfast
and
starting
for
the
fields
;
and
Jim
's
nigger
was
*NL*
piling
up
a
tin
pan
with
bread
and
meat
and
things
;
and
whilst
the
*NL*
others
was
leaving
,
the
key
come
from
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
nigger
had
a
good-natured
,
chuckle-headed
face
,
and
his
wool
was
*NL*
all
tied
up
in
little
bunches
with
thread
.
That
was
to
keep
witches
*NL*
off
.
He
said
the
witches
was
pestering
him
awful
these
nights
,
and
*NL*
making
him
see
all
kinds
of
strange
things
,
and
hear
all
kinds
of
*NL*
strange
words
and
noises
,
and
he
did
n't
believe
he
was
ever
witched
so
*NL*
long
before
in
his
life
.
He
got
so
worked
up
,
and
got
to
running
on
so
*NL*
about
his
troubles
,
he
forgot
all
about
what
he
'd
been
a-going
to
do
.
*NL*
So
Tom
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
vittles
for
?
Going
to
feed
the
dogs
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
nigger
kind
of
smiled
around
graduly
over
his
face
,
like
when
you
*NL*
heave
a
brickbat
in
a
mud-puddle
,
and
he
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Mars
Sid
,
_
a
_
dog
.
Cur
`
us
dog
,
too
.
Does
you
want
to
go
en
look
*NL*
at
`
im
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
hunched
Tom
,
and
whispers
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
going
,
right
here
in
the
daybreak
?
_
That
_
war
n't
the
plan

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
war
n't
;
but
it
's
the
plan
_
now
.
_
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
,
drat
him
,
we
went
along
,
but
I
did
n't
like
it
much
.
When
we
got
in
*NL*
we
could
n't
hardly
see
anything
,
it
was
so
dark
;
but
Jim
was
there
,
*NL*
sure
enough
,
and
could
see
us
;
and
he
sings
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
_
Huck
!
_
En
good
_
lan
'
!
_
ain
'
dat
Misto
Tom
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
just
knowed
how
it
would
be
;
I
just
expected
it
.
I
did
n't
know
*NL*
nothing
to
do
;
and
if
I
had
I
could
n't
`
a
'
done
it
,
because
that
*NL*
nigger
busted
in
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
de
gracious
sakes
!
do
he
know
you
genlmen
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
could
see
pretty
well
now
.
Tom
he
looked
at
the
nigger
,
steady
and
*NL*
kind
of
wondering
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
_
who
_
know
us
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
dis-yer
runaway
nigger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
reckon
he
does
;
but
what
put
that
into
your
head
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
_
put
_
it
dar
?
Didn
'
he
jis
'
dis
minute
sing
out
like
he
knowed
*NL*
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
says
,
in
a
puzzled-up
kind
of
way
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
's
mighty
curious
.
_
Who
_
sung
out
?
_
When
_
did
he
sing
out
?
*NL*
_
What
_
did
he
sing
out
?
''
And
turns
to
me
,
perfectly
ca
'm
,
and
says
,
*NL*
``
Did
_
you
_
hear
anybody
sing
out
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
there
war
n't
nothing
to
be
said
but
the
one
thing
;
so
I
*NL*
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
_
I
_
ai
n't
heard
nobody
say
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
turns
to
Jim
,
and
looks
him
over
like
he
never
see
him
before
,
*NL*
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
sing
out
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sah
,
''
says
Jim
;
``
I
hai
n't
said
nothing
,
sah
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
word

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

sah

I
hai
n't
said
a

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sah
;
not
as
I
knows
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
Tom
turns
to
the
nigger
,
which
was
looking
wild
and
distressed
,
and
*NL*
says
,
kind
of
severe
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
reckon
's
the
matter
with
you

What

*NL*
*NL*
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
give
him
a
dime
,
and
said
we
would
n't
tell
nobody
;
and
told
him
to
*NL*
buy
some
more
thread
to
tie
up
his
wool
with
;
and
then
looks
at
Jim
,
*NL*
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
if
Uncle
Silas
is
going

hang

If
I
was
to

catch

was
ungrateful
enough
to
run
away
,
I
would
n't
give
*NL*
him
up
,
I
'd
hang
him

''
And
whilst
the
nigger
stepped
to
the
door
to
*NL*
look
at
the
dime
and
bite
it
to
see
if
it
was
good
,
he
whispers
to
Jim
*NL*
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
ever
let
on
to
know
us

And
if
you
hear
any
digging
going

nights

it
's
us
;
we
're
going
to
set
you
free
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jim
only
had
time
to
grab
us
by
the
hand
and
squeeze
it
;
then
the
*NL*
nigger
come
back
,
and
we
said
we
'd
come
again
some
time
if
the
nigger
*NL*
wanted
us
to
;
and
he
said
he
would
,
more
particular
if
it
was
dark
,
*NL*
because
the
witches
went
for
him
mostly
in
the
dark
,
and
it
was
good
*NL*
to
have
folks
around
then

CHAPTER
XXXV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
be
most
an
hour
yet
till
breakfast
,
so
we
left
and
struck
*NL*
down
into
the
woods
;
because
Tom
said
we
got
to
have
_
some
_
light
to
*NL*
see
how
to
dig
by
,
and
a
lantern
makes
too
much
,
and
might
get
us
into
*NL*
trouble
;
what
we
must
have
was
a
lot
of
them
rotten
chunks
that
's
*NL*
called
fox-fire
,
and
just
makes
a
soft
kind
of
a
glow
when
you
lay
*NL*
them
in
a
dark
place
.
We
fetched
an
armful
and
hid
it
in
the
weeds
,
*NL*
and
set
down
to
rest
,
and
Tom
says
,
kind
of
dissatisfied
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Blame
it
,
this
whole
thing
is
just
as
easy
and
awkward
as
it
can
be
.
*NL*
And
so
it
makes
it
so
rotten
difficult
to
get
up
a
difficult
plan
.
*NL*
There
ai
n't
no
watchman
to
be
drugged
--
now
there
_
ought
_
to
be
a
*NL*
watchman
.
There
ai
n't
even
a
dog
to
give
a
sleeping-mixture
to
.
And
*NL*
there
's
Jim
chained
by
one
leg
,
with
a
ten-foot
chain
,
to
the
leg
of
*NL*
his
bed
:
why
,
all
you
got
to
do
is
to
lift
up
the
bedstead
and
slip
*NL*
off
the
chain
.
And
Uncle
Silas
he
trusts
everybody
;
sends
the
key
to
*NL*
the
punkin-headed
nigger
,
and
do
n't
send
nobody
to
watch
the
nigger
.
*NL*
Jim
could
`
a
'
got
out
of
that
window-hole
before
this
,
only
there
*NL*
would
n't
be
no
use
trying
to
travel
with
a
ten-foot
chain
on
his
leg
.
*NL*
Why
,
drat
it
,
Huck
,
it
's
the
stupidest
arrangement
I
ever
see
.
You
got
*NL*
to
invent
_
all
_
the
difficulties
.
Well
,
we
ca
n't
help
it
;
we
got
to
do
*NL*
the
best
we
can
with
the
materials
we
've
got
.
Anyhow
,
there
's
one
*NL*
thing
--
there
's
more
honor
in
getting
him
out
through
a
lot
of
*NL*
difficulties
and
dangers
,
where
there
war
n't
one
of
them
furnished
to
*NL*
you
by
the
people
who
it
was
their
duty
to
furnish
them
,
and
you
had
*NL*
to
contrive
them
all
out
of
your
own
head
.
Now
look
at
just
that
one
*NL*
thing
of
the
lantern
.
When
you
come
down
to
the
cold
facts
,
we
simply
*NL*
got
to
_
let
on
_
that
a
lantern
's
resky
.
Why
,
we
could
work
with
a
*NL*
torchlight
procession
if
we
wanted
to
,
_
I
_
believe
.
Now
,
whilst
I
*NL*
think
of
it
,
we
got
to
hunt
up
something
to
make
a
saw
out
of
the
*NL*
first
chance
we
get
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
we
want
of
a
saw
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
we
_
want
_
of
a
saw
?
Hai
n't
we
got
to
saw
the
leg
of
Jim
's
bed
*NL*
off
,
so
as
to
get
the
chain
loose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
just
said
a
body
could
lift
up
the
bedstead
and
slip
the
*NL*
chain
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
if
that
ai
n't
just
like
you
,
Huck
Finn
.
You
_
can
_
get
up
the
*NL*
infant-schooliest
ways
of
going
at
a
thing
.
Why
,
hai
n't
you
ever
read
*NL*
any
books
at
all
?
--
Baron
Trenck
,
nor
Casanova
,
nor
Benvenuto
*NL*
Chelleeny
,
nor
Henri
IV.
,
nor
none
of
them
heroes
?
Who
ever
heard
of
*NL*
getting
a
prisoner
loose
in
such
an
old-maidy
way
as
that
?
No
;
the
*NL*
way
all
the
best
authorities
does
is
to
saw
the
bed-leg
in
two
,
and
*NL*
leave
it
just
so
,
and
swallow
the
sawdust
,
so
it
ca
n't
be
found
,
and
*NL*
put
some
dirt
and
grease
around
the
sawed
place
so
the
very
keenest
*NL*
seneskal
ca
n't
see
no
sign
of
its
being
sawed
,
and
thinks
the
bed-leg
*NL*
is
perfectly
sound
.
Then
,
the
night
you
're
ready
,
fetch
the
leg
a
*NL*
kick
,
down
she
goes
;
slip
off
your
chain
,
and
there
you
are
.
Nothing
*NL*
to
do
but
hitch
your
rope
ladder
to
the
battlements
,
shin
down
it
,
*NL*
break
your
leg
in
the
moat
--
because
a
rope
ladder
is
nineteen
foot
too
*NL*
short
,
you
know
--
and
there
's
your
horses
and
your
trusty
vassles
,
and
*NL*
they
scoop
you
up
and
fling
you
across
a
saddle
,
and
away
you
go
to
*NL*
your
native
Langudoc
,
or
Navarre
,
or
wherever
it
is
.
It
's
gaudy
,
Huck
.
*NL*
I
wish
there
was
a
moat
to
this
cabin
.
If
we
get
time
,
the
night
of
*NL*
the
escape
,
we
'll
dig
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do

*NL*
*NL*
But
he
never
heard
me

He
had
forgot
me
and
everything
else

He
had
*NL*
his
chin
in
his
hand

thinking

Pretty
soon
he
sighs
and
shakes
his
*NL*
head
;
then
sighs
again
,
and
says
:

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
some
of
the
best
authorities
has
done
it

They
could
n't
get
the

chain
off

so
they
just
cut
their
hand
off

shoved

And
a

we

ai

up

into
trouble

with

up

hide
in

straw
tick

as
any
rag
ladder
you
can
start

for

*NL*
*NL*
He
said
that
would
do
.
And
that
gave
him
another
idea
,

he
says
:

*NL*
``
Borrow

What

care

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
broke
off
there
,
because
we
heard
the
breakfast-horn
blowing
.
So
we
*NL*
cleared
out
for
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Along
during
the
morning
I
borrowed
a
sheet
and
a
white
shirt
off
of
*NL*
the
clothes-line
;
and
I
found
an
old
sack
and
put
them
in
it
,
and
we
*NL*
went
down
and
got
the
fox-fire
,
and
put
that
in
too
.
I
called
it
*NL*
borrowing
,
because
that
was
what
pap
always
called
it
;
but
Tom
said
it
*NL*
war
n't
borrowing
,
it
was
stealing
.
He
said
we
was
representing
*NL*
prisoners
;
and
prisoners
do
n't
care
how
they
get
a
thing
so
they
get
*NL*
it
,
and
nobody
do
n't
blame
them
for
it
,
either
.
It
ai
n't
no
crime
in
a
*NL*
prisoner
to
steal
the
thing
he
needs
to
get
away
with
,
Tom
said
;
it
's
*NL*
his
right
;
and
so
,
as
long
as
we
was
representing
a
prisoner
,
we
had
a
*NL*
perfect
right
to
steal
anything
on
this
place
we
had
the
least
use
for
*NL*
to
get
ourselves
out
of
prison
with
.
He
said
if
we
war
n't
prisoners
it
*NL*
would
be
a
very
different
thing
,
and
nobody
but
a
mean
,
ornery
person
*NL*
would
steal
when
he
war
n't
a
prisoner
.
So
we
allowed
we
would
steal
*NL*
everything
there
was
that
come
handy
.
And
yet
he
made
a
mighty
fuss
,
*NL*
one
day
,
after
that
,
when
I
stole
a
watermelon
out
of
the
nigger
patch
*NL*
and
eat
it
;
and
he
made
me
go
and
give
the
niggers
a
dime
without
*NL*
telling
them
what
it
was
for
.
Tom
said
that
what
he
meant
was
,
we
*NL*
could
steal
anything
we
_
needed
.
_
Well
,
I
says
,
I
needed
the
*NL*
watermelon
.
But
he
said
I
did
n't
need
it
to
get
out
of
prison
with
;
*NL*
there
's
where
the
difference
was
.
He
said
if
I
'd
`
a
'
wanted
it
to
hide
*NL*
a
knife
in
,
and
smuggle
it
to
Jim
to
kill
the
seneskal
with
,
it
would
*NL*
`
a
'
been
all
right
.
So
I
let
it
go
at
that
,
though
I
could
n't
see
no
*NL*
advantage
in
my
representing
a
prisoner
if
I
got
to
set
down
and
chaw
*NL*
over
a
lot
of
gold-leaf
distinctions
like
that
every
time
I
see
a
*NL*
chance
to
hog
a
watermelon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
as
I
was
saying
,
we
waited
that
morning
till
everybody
was
*NL*
settled
down
to
business
,
and
nobody
in
sight
around
the
yard
;
then
*NL*
Tom
he
carried
the
sack
into
the
lean-to
whilst
I
stood
off
a
piece
to
*NL*
keep
watch
.
By
and
by
he
come
out
,
and
we
went
and
set
down
on
the
*NL*
woodpile
to
talk
.
He
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything
's
all
right
now
except
tools
;
and
that
's
easy
fixed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tools

I
says

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tools
for
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

n't
a-going

him
out

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ai
n't

old
crippled
picks

things
in
there
good
enough
to

a

out

''
I
says
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turns
on
me
,
looking
pitying
enough
to
make
a
body
cry
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``

CHAPTER
XXXVI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
we
reckoned
everybody
was
asleep
that
night
we
went
down
*NL*
the
lightning-rod
,
and
shut
ourselves
up
in
the
lean-to
,
and
got
out
*NL*
our
pile
of
fox-fire
,
and
went
to
work
.
We
cleared
everything
out
of
*NL*
the
way
,
about
four
or
five
foot
along
the
middle
of
the
bottom
log
.
*NL*
Tom
said
we
was
right
behind
Jim
's
bed
now
,
and
we
'd
dig
in
under
it
,
*NL*
and
when
we
got
through
there
could
n't
nobody
in
the
cabin
ever
know
*NL*
there
was
any
hole
there
,
because
Jim
's
counterpin
hung
down
most
to
*NL*
the
ground
,
and
you
'd
have
to
raise
it
up
and
look
under
to
see
the
*NL*
hole
.
So
we
dug
and
dug
with
the
case-knives
till
most
midnight
;
and
*NL*
then
we
was
dog-tired
,
and
our
hands
was
blistered
,
and
yet
you
*NL*
could
n't
see
we
'd
done
anything
hardly
.
At
last
I
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
ai
n't
no
thirty-seven-year
job
;
this
is
a
thirty-eight-year
job
,
*NL*
Tom
Sawyer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
never
said
nothing
.
But
he
sighed
,
and
pretty
soon
he
stopped
*NL*
digging
,
and
then
for
a
good
little
while
I
knowed
that
he
was
*NL*
thinking
.
Then
he
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
ai
n't
no
use
,
Huck
,
it
ai
n't
a-going
to
work
.
If
we
was
prisoners
*NL*
it
would
,
because
then
we
'd
have
as
many
years
as
we
wanted
,
and
no
*NL*
hurry
;
and
we
would
n't
get
but
a
few
minutes
to
dig
,
every
day
,
while
*NL*
they
was
changing
watches
,
and
so
our
hands
would
n't
get
blistered
,
*NL*
and
we
could
keep
it
up
right
along
,
year
in
and
year
out
,
and
do
it
*NL*
right
,
and
the
way
it
ought
to
be
done
.
But
_
we
_
ca
n't
fool
along
;
we
*NL*
got
to
rush
;
we
ai
n't
got
no
time
to
spare
.
If
we
was
to
put
in
*NL*
another
night
this
way
we
'd
have
to
knock
off
for
a
week
to
let
our
*NL*
hands
get
well
--
could
n't
touch
a
case-knife
with
them
sooner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
what
we
going
to
do
,
Tom
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
.
It
ai
n't
right
,
and
it
ai
n't
moral
,
and
I
would
n't
*NL*
like
it
to
get
out
;
but
there
ai
n't
only
just
the
one
way
:
we
got
to
*NL*
dig
him
out
with
the
picks
,
and
_
let
on
_
it
's
case-knives
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Now
_
you
're
_
talking
!
_
''
I
says
;
``
your
head
gets
leveler
and
leveler
*NL*
all
the
time
,
Tom
Sawyer
,
''
I
says
.
``
Picks
is
the
thing
,
moral
or
no
*NL*
moral
;
and
as
for
me
,
I
do
n't
care
shucks
for
the
morality
of
it
,
*NL*
nohow
.
When
I
start
in
to
steal
a
nigger
,
or
a
watermelon
,
or
a
*NL*
Sunday-school
book
,
I
ai
n't
no
ways
particular
how
it
's
done
so
it
's
*NL*
done
.
What
I
want
is
my
nigger
;
or
what
I
want
is
my
watermelon
;
or
*NL*
what
I
want
is
my
Sunday-school
book
;
and
if
a
pick
's
the
handiest
*NL*
thing
,
that
's
the
thing
I
'm
a-going
to
dig
that
nigger
or
that
*NL*
watermelon
or
that
Sunday-school
book
out
with

and
I
do
n't
give
a
*NL*
dead
rat
what
the
authorities
thinks
about
it
nuther
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
says
,
``
there
's
excuse
for
picks
and
letting
on
in
a
case
*NL*
like
this
;
if
it
war
n't
so
,
I
would
n't
approve
of
it
,
nor
I
would
n't
*NL*
stand
by
and
see
the
rules
broke
--
because
right
is
right
,
and
wrong
is
*NL*
wrong
,
and
a
body
ai
n't
got
no
business
doing
wrong
when
he
ai
n't
*NL*
ignorant
and
knows
better
.
It
might
answer
for
_
you
_
to
dig
Jim
out
*NL*
with
a
pick
,
_
without
_
any
letting
on
,
because
you
do
n't
know
no
*NL*
better
;
but
it
would
n't
for
me
,
because
I
do
know
better
.
Gim
me
a
*NL*
case-knife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
his
own
by
him
,
but
I
handed
him
mine
.
He
flung
it
down
,
and
*NL*
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gim
me
a
_
case-knife
.
_
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
n't
know
just
what
to
do
--
but
then
I
thought
.
I
scratched
around
*NL*
amongst
the
old
tools
,
and
got
a
pickax
and
give
it
to
him
,
and
he
*NL*
took
it
and
went
to
work
,
and
never
said
a
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
always
just
that
particular
.
Full
of
principle
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
then
I
got
a
shovel
,
and
then
we
picked
and
shoveled
,
turn
about
,
*NL*
and
made
the
fur
fly
.
We
stuck
to
it
about
a
half
an
hour
,
which
was
*NL*
as
long
as
we
could
stand
up
;
but
we
had
a
good
deal
of
a
hole
to
show
*NL*
for
it
.
When
I
got
up-stairs
I
looked
out
at
the
window
and
see
Tom
*NL*
doing
his
level
best
with
the
lightning-rod
,
but
he
could
n't
come
it
,
*NL*
his
hands
was
so
sore
.
At
last
he
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
ai
n't
no
use
,
it
ca
n't
be
done
.
What
you
reckon
I
better
do
?
Ca
n't
*NL*
you
think
of
no
way
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
I
says
,
``
but
I
reckon
it
ai
n't
regular
.
Come
up
the
stairs
,
and
*NL*
let
on
it
's
a
lightning-rod
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
done
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
Tom
stole
a
pewter
spoon
and
a
brass
candlestick
in
the
*NL*
house
,
for
to
make
some
pens
for
Jim
out
of
,
and
six
tallow
candles
;
*NL*
and
I
hung
around
the
nigger
cabins
and
laid
for
a
chance
,
and
stole
*NL*
three
tin
plates
.
Tom
says
it
was
n't
enough
;
but
I
said
nobody
*NL*
would
n't
ever
see
the
plates
that
Jim
throwed
out
,
because
they
'd
fall
*NL*
in
the
dog-fennel
and
jimpson
weeds
under
the
window-hole
--
then
we
*NL*
could
tote
them
back
and
he
could
use
them
over
again
.
So
Tom
was
*NL*
satisfied
.
Then
he
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
the
thing
to
study
out
is
,
how
to
get
the
things
to
Jim
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
them
in
through
the
hole
,
''
I
says
,
``
when
we
get
it
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
only
just
looked
scornful
,
and
said
something
about
nobody
ever
*NL*
heard
of
such
an
idiotic
idea
,
and
then
he
went
to
studying
.
By
and
by
*NL*
he
said
he
had
ciphered
out
two
or
three
ways
,
but
there
war
n't
no
*NL*
need
to
decide
on
any
of
them
yet
.
Said
we
'd
got
to
post
Jim
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
night
we
went
down
the
lightning-rod
a
little
after
ten
,
and
took
*NL*
one
of
the
candles
along
,
and
listened
under
the
window-hole
,
and
*NL*
heard
Jim
snoring
;
so
we
pitched
it
in
,
and
it
did
n't
wake
him
.
Then
*NL*
we
whirled
in
with
the
pick
and
shovel
,
and
in
about
two
hours
and
a
*NL*
half
the
job
was
done
.
We
crept
in
under
Jim
's
bed
and
into
the
cabin
,
*NL*
and
pawed
around
and
found
the
candle
and
lit
it
,
and
stood
over
Jim
*NL*
awhile
,
and
found
him
looking
hearty
and
healthy
,
and
then
we
woke
him
*NL*
up
gentle
and
gradual
.
He
was
so
glad
to
see
us
he
most
cried
;
and
*NL*
called
us
honey
,
and
all
the
pet
names
he
could
think
of
;
and
was
for
*NL*
having
us
hunt
up
a
cold-chisel
to
cut
the
chain
off
of
his
leg
with
*NL*
right
away
,
and
clearing
out
without
losing
any
time
.
But
Tom
he
*NL*
showed
him
how
unregular
it
would
be
,
and
set
down
and
told
him
all
*NL*
about
our
plans
,
and
how
we
could
alter
them
in
a
minute
any
time
*NL*
there
was
an
alarm
;
and
not
to
be
the
least
afraid
,
because
we
would
*NL*
see
he
got
away
,
_
sure
_
.
So
Jim
he
said
it
was
all
right
,
and
we
set
*NL*
there
and
talked
over
old
times
awhile
,
and
then
Tom
asked
a
lot
of
*NL*
questions
,
and
when
Jim
told
him
Uncle
Silas
come
in
every
day
or
two
*NL*
to
pray
with
him
,
and
Aunt
Sally
come
in
to
see
if
he
was
comfortable
*NL*
and
had
plenty
to
eat
,
and
both
of
them
was
kind
as
they
could
be
,
Tom
*NL*
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Now
_
I
know
how
to
fix
it
.
We
'll
send
you
some
things
by
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
,
``
Do
n't
do
nothing
of
the
kind
;
it
's
one
of
the
most
jackass
*NL*
ideas
I
ever
struck
''
;
but
he
never
paid
no
attention
to
me
;
went
right
*NL*
on
.
It
was
his
way
when
he
'd
got
his
plans
set
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
told
Jim
how
we
'd
have
to
smuggle
in
the
rope-ladder
pie
and
*NL*
other
large
things
by
Nat
,
the
nigger
that
fed
him
,
and
he
must
be
on
*NL*
the
lookout
,
and
not
be
surprised
,
and
not
let
Nat
see
him
open
them
;
*NL*
and
we
would
put
small
things
in
uncle
's
coat
pockets
and
he
must
*NL*
steal
them
out
;
and
we
would
tie
things
to
aunt
's
apron-strings
or
put
*NL*
them
in
her
apron
pocket
,
if
we
got
a
chance
;
and
told
him
what
they
*NL*
would
be
and
what
they
was
for
.
And
told
him
how
to
keep
a
journal
on
*NL*
the
shirt
with
his
blood
,
and
all
that
.
He
told
him
everything
.
Jim
he
*NL*
could
n't
see
no
sense
in
the
most
of
it
,
but
he
allowed
we
was
white
*NL*
folks
and
knowed
better
than
him
;
so
he
was
satisfied
,
and
said
he
*NL*
would
do
it
all
just
as
Tom
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jim
had
plenty
corn-cob
pipes
and
tobacco
;
so
we
had
a
right
down
good
*NL*
sociable
time
;
then
we
crawled
out
through
the
hole
,
and
so
home
to
*NL*
bed
,
with
hands
that
looked
like
they
'd
been
chawed
.
Tom
was
in
high
*NL*
spirits
.
He
said
it
was
the
best
fun
he
ever
had
in
his
life
,
and
the
*NL*
most
intellectural
;
and
said
if
he
only
could
see
his
way
to
it
we
*NL*
would
keep
it
up
all
the
rest
of
our
lives
and
leave
Jim
to
our
*NL*
children
to
get
out
;
for
he
believed
Jim
would
come
to
like
it
better
*NL*
and
better
the
more
he
got
used
to
it
.
He
said
that
in
that
way
it
*NL*
could
be
strung
out
to
as
much
as
eighty
year
,
and
would
be
the
best
*NL*
time
on
record
.
And
he
said
it
would
make
us
all
celebrated
that
had
a
*NL*
hand
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
we
went
out
to
the
woodpile
and
chopped
up
the
brass
*NL*
candlestick
into
handy
sizes
,
and
Tom
put
them
and
the
pewter
spoon
in
*NL*
his
pocket
.
Then
we
went
to
the
nigger
cabins
,
and
while
I
got
Nat
's
*NL*
notice
off
,
Tom
shoved
a
piece
of
candlestick
into
the
middle
of
a
*NL*
corn-pone
that
was
in
Jim
's
pan
,
and
we
went
along
with
Nat
to
see
how
*NL*
it
would
work
,
and
it
just
worked
noble
;
when
Jim
bit
into
it
it
most
*NL*
mashed
all
his
teeth
out
;
and
there
war
n't
ever
anything
could
`
a
'
*NL*
worked
better
.
Tom
said
so
himself
.
Jim
he
never
let
on
but
what
it
*NL*
was
only
just
a
piece
of
rock
or
something
like
that
that
's
always
*NL*
getting
into
bread
,
you
know
;
but
after
that
he
never
bit
into
nothing
*NL*
but
what
he
jabbed
his
fork
into
it
in
three
or
four
places
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
whilst
we
was
a-standing
there
in
the
dimmish
light
,
here
comes
a
*NL*
couple
of
the
hounds
bulging
in
from
under
Jim
's
bed
;
and
they
kept
on
*NL*
piling
in
till
there
was
eleven
of
them
,
and
there
war
n't
hardly
room
*NL*
in
there
to
get
your
breath
.
By
jings
,
we
forgot
to
fasten
that
*NL*
lean-to
door
!
The
nigger
Nat
he
only
just
hollered
``
Witches
''
once
,
and
*NL*
keeled
over
onto
the
floor
amongst
the
dogs
,
and
begun
to
groan
like
*NL*
he
was
dying
.
Tom
jerked
the
door
open
and
flung
out
a
slab
of
Jim
's
*NL*
meat
,
and
the
dogs
went
for
it
,
and
in
two
seconds
he
was
out
himself
*NL*
and
back
again
and
shut
the
door
,
and
I
knowed
he
'd
fixed
the
other
*NL*
door
too
.
Then
he
went
to
work
on
the
nigger
,
coaxing
him
and
petting
*NL*
him
,
and
asking
him
if
he
'd
been
imagining
he
saw
something
again
.
He
*NL*
raised
up
,
and
blinked
his
eyes
around
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``

CHAPTER
XXXVII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
_
That
_
was
all
fixed
.
So
then
we
went
away
and
went
to
the
*NL*
rubbage-pile
in
the
back
yard
,
where
they
keep
the
old
boots
,
and
*NL*
rags
,
and
pieces
of
bottles
,
and
wore-out
tin
things
,
and
all
such
*NL*
truck
,
and
scratched
around
and
found
an
old
tin
washpan
,
and
stopped
*NL*
up
the
holes
as
well
as
we
could
,
to
bake
the
pie
in
,
and
took
it
down
*NL*
cellar
and
stole
it
full
of
flour
and
started
for
breakfast
,
and
found
*NL*
a
couple
of
shingle-nails
that
Tom
said
would
be
handy
for
a
prisoner
*NL*
to
scrabble
his
name
and
sorrows
on
the
dungeon
walls
with
,
and
*NL*
dropped
one
of
them
in
Aunt
Sally
's
apron
pocket
which
was
hanging
on
*NL*
a
chair
,
and
t
`
other
we
stuck
in
the
band
of
Uncle
Silas
's
hat
,
which
*NL*
was
on
the
bureau
,
because
we
heard
the
children
say
their
pa
and
ma
*NL*
was
going
to
the
runaway
nigger
's
house
this
morning
,
and
then
went
to
*NL*
breakfast
,
and
Tom
dropped
the
pewter
spoon
in
Uncle
Silas
's
coat
*NL*
pocket
,
and
Aunt
Sally
was
n't
come
yet
,
so
we
had
to
wait
a
little
*NL*
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
when
she
come
she
was
hot
and
red
and
cross
,
and
could
n't
hardly
*NL*
wait
for
the
blessing
;
and
then
she
went
to
sluicing
out
coffee
with
*NL*
one
hand
and
cracking
the
handiest
child
's
head
with
her
thimble
with
*NL*
the
other
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
hunted
high
and
I
've
hunted
low
,
and
it
does
beat
all
what
_
has
_
*NL*
become
of
your
other
shirt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
heart
fell
down
amongst
my
lungs
and
livers
and
things
,
and
a
hard
*NL*
piece
of
corn-crust
started
down
my
throat
after
it
and
got
met
on
the
*NL*
road
with
a
cough
,
and
was
shot
across
the
table
,
and
took
one
of
the
*NL*
children
in
the
eye
and
curled
him
up
like
a
fishing-worm
,
and
let
a
*NL*
cry
out
of
him
the
size
of
a
war-whoop
,
and
Tom
he
turned
kinder
blue
*NL*
around
the
gills
,
and
it
all
amounted
to
a
considerable
state
of
*NL*
things
for
about
a
quarter
of
a
minute
or
as
much
as
that
,
and
I
would
*NL*
`
a
'
sold
out
for
half
price
if
there
was
a
bidder
.
But
after
that
we
*NL*
was
all
right
again
--
it
was
the
sudden
surprise
of
it
that
knocked
us
*NL*
so
kind
of
cold
.
Uncle
Silas
he
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
most
uncommon
curious
,
I
ca
n't
understand
it
.
I
know
perfectly
*NL*
well
I
took
it
_
off
_
,
because
--

*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
you

n't
got
but
one

on

Just
_
listen
_
at
the
man
!
I
know
*NL*
you
took
it
off
,
and
know
it
by
a
better
way
than
your
wool-gethering
*NL*
memory
,
too
,
because
it
was
on
the
clo
's

yesterday

I
see
it
*NL*
there
myself

But
it
's
gone
,
that
's
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
,

*NL*
you
'll
just
have
to
change
to

red
flann

l
one
till
I
can
get
time
to
*NL*
make
a
new
one

it
'll
be
the

I

made
in

was

begun

I
reckoned

would
sneak
out

go

moderated

She

kept
a-raging
right
along

running
her

by

everybody

mighty
meek

quiet

at

Uncle

looking

fishes
up

up

not

``

I

alone
speaking

and
I
'd
`

got
up

obeyed
her
if
I

`

been
dead

As
we
*NL*
was
passing
through
the
setting-room
the
old
man
he
took
up
his
hat
,
*NL*
and
the
shingle-nail
fell
out
on
the
floor
,
and
he
just
merely
picked
*NL*
it
up
and
laid
it
on
the
mantel-shelf
,
and
never
said
nothing
,
and
*NL*
went
out
.
Tom
see
him
do
it
,
and
remembered
about
the
spoon
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
ai
n't
no
use

by

*NL*
reliable

''
Then
he
says
:
``
But
he
done
us
a
good
turn
with
the
spoon
,
*NL*
anyway
,
without
knowing
it
,
and
so
we
'll
go
and
do
him
one
without
*NL*
_
him
_
knowing
it
--
stop
up
his
rat-holes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
noble
good
lot
of
them
down
cellar
,
and
it
took
us
a
whole
*NL*
hour
,
but
we
done
the
job
tight
and
good
and
shipshape
.
Then
we
heard
*NL*
steps
on
the
stairs
,
and
blowed
out
our
light
and
hid
;
and
here
comes
*NL*
the
old
man
,
with
a
candle
in
one
hand
and
a
bundle
of
stuff
in
*NL*
t
`
other
,
looking
as
absent-minded
as
year
before
last
.
He
went
*NL*
a-mooning
around
,
first
to
one
rat-hole
and
then
another
,
till
he
'd
*NL*
been
to
them
all
.
Then
he
stood
about
five
minutes
,
picking
*NL*
tallow-drip
off
of
his
candle
and
thinking
.
Then
he
turns
off
slow
and
*NL*
dreamy
towards
the
stairs
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
for
the
life
of
me
I
ca
n't
remember
when
I
done
it

I
could
*NL*
show
her
now
that
I
war
n't
to
blame
on
account
of
the
rats
.
But
never
*NL*
mind
--
let
it
go
.
I
reckon
it
would
n't
do
no
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
he
went
on
a-mumbling
up-stairs
,
and
then
we
left
.
He
was
a
*NL*
mighty
nice
old
man
.
And
always
is
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
was
a
good
deal
bothered
about
what
to
do
for
a
spoon
,
but
he
said
*NL*
we
'd
got
to
have
it
;
so
he
took
a
think
.
When
he
had
ciphered
it
out
*NL*
he
told
me
how
we
was
to
do
;
then
we
went
and
waited
around
the
*NL*
spoon-basket
till
we
see
Aunt
Sally
coming
,
and
then
Tom
went
to
*NL*
counting
the
spoons
and
laying
them
out
to
one
side
,
and
I
slid
one
of
*NL*
them
up
my
sleeve
,
and
Tom
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Aunt
Sally

there
ai
n't
but

spoons

yet

*NL*
*NL*
She
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
out
of
all
patience
,
but
of
course
she
come
to
*NL*
count
--
anybody
would

*NL*
*NL*
``

she
says

*NL*
*NL*
So
I
slipped
back
the
one
I
had
,
and
when
she
got
done
counting
,
she
*NL*
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hang
the
troublesome
rubbage
,
ther
's
_
ten
_
now
!
''
and
she
looked
huffy
*NL*
and
bothered
both
.
But
Tom
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Aunty
,
I
do
n't
think
there
's
ten
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
numskull
,
did
n't
you
see
me
_
count
_
'm
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
,
but
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'll
count
'm
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
I
smouched
one
,
and
they
come
out
nine
,
same
as
the
other
time
.
*NL*
Well
,
she
_
was
_
in
a
tearing
way
--
just
a-trembling
all
over
,
she
was
*NL*
so
mad
.
But
she
counted
and
counted
till
she
got
that
addled
she
'd
*NL*
start
to
count
in
the
basket
for
a
spoon
sometimes
;
and
so
,
three
*NL*
times
they
come
out
right
,
and
three
times
they
come
out
wrong
.
Then
*NL*
she
grabbed
up
the
basket
and
slammed
it
across
the
house
and
knocked
*NL*
the
cat
galley-west
;
and
she
said
cler
out
and
let
her
have
some
*NL*
peace
,
and
if
we
come
bothering
around
her
again
betwixt
that
and
*NL*
dinner
she
'd
skin
us
.
So
we
had
the
odd
spoon
,
and
dropped
it
in
her
*NL*
apron
pocket
whilst
she
was
a-giving
us
our
sailing
orders
,
and
Jim
*NL*
got
it
all
right
,
along
with
her
shingle-nail
,
before
noon
.
We
was
*NL*
very
well
satisfied
with
this
business
,
and
Tom
allowed
it
was
worth
*NL*
twice
the
trouble
it
took
,
because
he
said
_
now
_
she
could
n't
ever
*NL*
count
them
spoons
twice
alike
again
to
save
her
life
;
and
would
n't
*NL*
believe
she
'd
counted
them
right
if
she
_
did
_
;
and
said
that
after
*NL*
she
'd
about
counted
her
head
off
for
the
next
three
days
he
judged
*NL*
she
'd
give
it
up
and
offer
to
kill
anybody
that
wanted
her
to
ever
*NL*
count
them
any
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
we
put
the
sheet
back
on
the
line
that
night
,
and
stole
one
out
of
*NL*
her
closet
;
and
kept
on
putting
it
back
and
stealing
it
again
for
a
*NL*
couple
of
days
till
she
did
n't
know
how
many
sheets
she
had
any
more
,
*NL*
and
she
did
n't
_
care
_
,
and
war
n't
a-going
to
bullyrag
the
rest
of
her
*NL*
soul
out
about
it
,
and
would
n't
count
them
again
not
to
save
her
life
;
*NL*
she
druther
die
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
we
was
all
right
now
,
as
to
the
shirt
and
the
sheet
and
the
spoon
*NL*
and
the
candles
,
by
the
help
of
the
calf
and
the
rats
and
the
mixed-up
*NL*
counting
;
and
as
to
the
candlestick
,
it
war
n't
no
consequence
,
it
*NL*
would
blow
over
by
and
by
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
that
pie
was
a
job
;
we
had
no
end
of
trouble
with
that
pie
.
We
*NL*
fixed
it
up
away
down
in
the
woods
,
and
cooked
it
there
;
and
we
got
it
*NL*
done
at
last
,
and
very
satisfactory
,
too
;
but
not
all
in
one
day
;
and
*NL*
we
had
to
use
up
three
wash-pans
full
of
flour
before
we
got
through
,
*NL*
and
we
got
burnt
pretty
much
all
over
,
in
places
,
and
eyes
put
out
*NL*
with
the
smoke
;
because
,
you
see
,
we
did
n't
want
nothing
but
a
crust
,
*NL*
and
we
could
n't
prop
it
up
right
,
and
she
would
always
cave
in
.
But
of
*NL*
course
we
thought
of
the
right
way
at
last
--
which
was
to
cook
the
*NL*
ladder
,
too
,
in
the
pie
.
So
then
we
laid
in
with
Jim
the
second
night
,
*NL*
and
tore
up
the
sheet
all
in
little
strings
and
twisted
them
together
,
*NL*
and
long
before
daylight
we
had
a
lovely
rope
that
you
could
`
a
'
hung
*NL*
a
person
with
.
We
let
on
it
took
nine
months
to
make
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
in
the
forenoon
we
took
it
down
to
the
woods
,
but
it
would
n't
go
*NL*
into
the
pie
.
Being
made
of
a
whole
sheet
,
that
way
,
there
was
rope
*NL*
enough
for
forty
pies
if
we
'd
`
a
'
wanted
them
,
and
plenty
left
over
*NL*
for
soup
,
or
sausage
,
or
anything
you
choose
.
We
could
`
a
'
had
a
whole
*NL*
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
we
did
n't
need
it
.
All
we
needed
was
just
enough
for
the
pie
,
and
*NL*
so
we
throwed
the
rest
away
.
We
did
n't
cook
none
of
the
pies
in
the
*NL*
washpan
--
afraid
the
solder
would
melt
;
but
Uncle
Silas
he
had
a
noble
*NL*
brass
warming-pan
which
he
thought
considerable
of
,
because
it
*NL*
belonged
to
one
of
his
ancesters
with
a
long
wooden
handle
that
come
*NL*
over
from
England
with
William
the
Conqueror
in
the
_
Mayflower
_
or
one
*NL*
of
them
early
ships
and
was
hid
away
up
garret
with
a
lot
of
other
old
*NL*
pots
and
things
that
was
valuable
,
not
on
account
of
being
any
*NL*
account
,
because
they
war
n't
,
but
on
account
of
them
being
relicts
,
*NL*
you
know
,
and
we
snaked
her
out
,
private
,
and
took
her
down
there
,
but
*NL*
she
failed
on
the
first
pies
,
because
we
did
n't
know
how
,
but
she
come
*NL*
up
smiling
on
the
last
one
.
We
took
and
lined
her
with
dough
,
and
set
*NL*
her
in
the
coals
,
and
loaded
her
up
with
rag
rope
,
and
put
on
a
dough
*NL*
roof
,
and
shut
down
the
lid
,
and
put
hot
embers
on
top
,
and
stood
off
*NL*
five
foot
,
with
the
long
handle
,
cool
and
comfortable
,
and
in
fifteen
*NL*
minutes
she
turned
out
a
pie
that
was
a
satisfaction
to
look
at
.
But
*NL*
the
person
that
et
it
would
want
to
fetch
a
couple
of
kags
of
*NL*
toothpicks
along
,
for
if
that
rope
ladder
would
n't
cramp
him
down
to
*NL*
business
I
do
n't
know
nothing
what
I
'm
talking
about
,
and
lay
him
in
*NL*
enough
stomach-ache
to
last
him
till
next
time
,
too
.
Nat
did
n't
look
*NL*
when
we
put
the
witch
pie
in
Jim
's
pan
;
and
we
put
the
three
tin
*NL*
plates
in
the
bottom
of
the
pan
under
the
vittles
;
and
so
Jim
got
*NL*
everything
all
right
,
and
as
soon
as
he
was
by
himself
he
busted
into
*NL*
the
pie
and
hid
the
rope
ladder
inside
of
his
straw
tick
,
and
*NL*
scratched
some
marks
on
a
tin
plate
and
throwed
it
out
of
the
*NL*
window-hole
.

CHAPTER
XXXVIII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Making
them
pens
was
a
distressid
tough
job
,
and
so
was
the
saw
;
and
*NL*
Jim
allowed
the
inscription
was
going
to
be
the
toughest
of
all
.
*NL*
That
's
the
one
which
the
prisoner
has
to
scrabble
on
the
wall
.
But
he
*NL*
had
to
have
it
;
Tom
said
he
'd
_
got
_
to
;
there
war
n't
no
case
of
a
*NL*
state
prisoner
not
scrabbling
his
inscription
to
leave
behind
,
and
his
*NL*
coat
of
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
at
Lady
Jane
Grey
,
''
he
says
;
``
look
at
Gilford
Dudley
;
look
at
*NL*
old
Northumberland
!
Why
,
Huck
,
s
`
pose
it
_
is
_
considerble
*NL*
trouble
?
--
what
you
going
to
do
?
--
how
you
going
to
get
around
it
?
Jim
's
*NL*
_
got
_
to
do
his
inscription
and
coat
of
arms
.
They
all
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jim
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Mars
Tom
,
I
hai
n't
got
no
coat
o
'
arm
;
I
hai
n't
got
nuffn
but
*NL*
dish
yer
ole
shirt
,
en
you
knows
I
got
to
keep
de
journal
on
dat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
do
n't
understand
,
Jim
;
a
coat
of
arms
is
very
different
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
I
says
,
``
Jim
's
right
,
anyway
,
when
he
says
he
ai
n't
got
no
*NL*
coat
of
arms
,
because
he
hai
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
reckon
I
knowed
that
,
''
Tom
says
,
``
but
you
bet
he
'll
have
one
before
*NL*
he
goes
out
of
this
--
because
he
's
going
out
_
right
_
,
and
there
ai
n't
*NL*
going
to
be
no
flaws
in
his
record
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
whilst
me
and
Jim
filed
away
at
the
pens
on
a
brickbat
apiece
,
Jim
*NL*
a-making
his
'n
out
of
the
brass
and
I
making
mine
out
of
the
spoon
,
*NL*
Tom
set
to
work
to
think
out
the
coat
of
arms
.
By
and
by
he
said
he
'd
*NL*
struck
so
many
good
ones
he
did
n't
hardly
know
which
to
take
,
but
*NL*
there
was
one
which
he
reckoned
he
'd
decide
on
.
He
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
scutcheon
we
'll
have
a
bend
_
or
_
in
the
dexter
base
,
a
saltire

murrey
_
in
the
fess
,
with
a
dog
,
couchant
,
for
common
charge
,
and
*NL*
under
his
foot
a
chain
embattled
,
for
slavery
,
with
a
chevron
_
vert
_
*NL*
in
a
chief
engrailed
,
and
three
invected
lines
on
a
field
_
azure
_
,
*NL*
with
the
nombril
points
rampant
on
a
dancette
indented
;
crest
,
a
*NL*
runaway
nigger
,
_
sable
_
,
with
his
bundle
over
his
shoulder
on
a
bar
*NL*
sinister
;
and
a
couple
of
gules
for
supporters
,
which
is
you
and
me
;
*NL*
motto
,
_
Maggiore

.

more

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Geewhillikins

''
I
says
,
``
but
what
does
the
rest
of
it
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
ai
n't
got
no
time
to
bother
over
that
,
''
he
says
;
``
we
got
to
dig
in
*NL*
like
all
git-out

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
anyway
,
''
I
says
,
``
what
's
_
some
_
of
it
?
What
's
a
fess
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A

n't

I
'll
show
*NL*
him
how
to
make
it
when
he
gets
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shucks
,
Tom
,
''
I
says
,
``
I
think
you
might
tell
a
person
.
What
's
a
bar
*NL*
sinister
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
know

But
he
's
got
to
have
it
.
All
the
nobility

''
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
just
his
way
.
If
it
did
n't
suit
him
to
explain
a
thing
to
*NL*
you
,
he
would
n't
do
it
.
You
might
pump
at
him
a
week
,
it
would
n't
make
*NL*
no
difference
.
He
'd
got
all
that
coat-of-arms
business
fixed
,
so
now
*NL*
he
started
in
to
finish
up
the
rest
of
that
part
of
the
work
,
which
*NL*
was
to
plan
out
a
mournful
inscription
--
said
Jim
got
to
have
one
,
like
*NL*
they
all
done
.
He
made
up
a
lot
,
and
wrote
them
out
on
a
paper
,
and
*NL*
read
them
off
,
so
:
*NL*
*NL*
_
1
.
Here
a
captive
heart
busted
.
*NL*
*NL*
2
.
Here
a
poor
prisoner
,
forsook
by
the
world
and
*NL*
friends
,
fretted
his
sorrowful
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
3
.
Here
a
lonely
heart
broke
,
and
a
worn
spirit
went
*NL*
to
its
rest
,
after
thirty-seven
years
of
solitary
captivity
.
*NL*
*NL*
4
.
Here
,
homeless
and
friendless
,
after
thirty-seven
*NL*
years
of
bitter
captivity
,
perished
a
noble
stranger
,
*NL*
natural
son
of
Louis
XIV
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
's
voice
trembled
whilst
he
was
reading
them
,
and
he
most
broke
*NL*
down
.
When
he
got
done
he
could
n't
no
way
make
up
his
mind
which
one
*NL*
for
Jim
to
scrabble
onto
the
wall
,
they
was
all
so
good
;
but
at
last
*NL*
he
allowed
he
would
let
him
scrabble
them
all
on
.
Jim
said
it
would
*NL*
take
him
a
year
to
scrabble
such
a
lot
of
truck
onto
the
logs
with
a
*NL*
nail
,
and
he
did
n't
know
how
to
make
letters
,
besides
;
but
Tom
said
he
*NL*
would
block
them
out
for
him
,
and
then
he
would
n't
have
nothing
to
do
*NL*
but
just
follow
the
lines
.
Then
pretty
soon
he
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
to
think
,
the
logs
ai
n't
a-going
to
do
;
they
do
n't
have
log
*NL*
walls
in
a
dungeon
:
we
got
to
dig
the
inscriptions
into
a
rock
.
We
'll
*NL*
fetch
a
rock
.
''
Jim
said
the
rock
was
worse
than
the
logs
;
he
said
it
*NL*
would
take
him
such
a
pison
long
time
to
dig
them
into
a
rock
he
*NL*
would
n't
ever
get
out
.
But
Tom
said
he
would
let
me
help
him
do
it
.
*NL*
Then
he
took
a
look
to
see
how
me
and
Jim
was
getting
along
with
the
*NL*
pens
.
It
was
most
pesky
tedious
hard
work
and
slow
,
and
did
n't
give
my
*NL*
hands
no
show
to
get
well
of
the
sores
,
and
we
did
n't
seem
to
make
no
*NL*
headway
,
hardly
;
so
Tom
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
how
to
fix
it
.
We
got
to
have
a
rock
for
the
coat
of
arms
and
*NL*
mournful
inscriptions
,
and
we
can
kill
two
birds
with
that
same
rock
.
*NL*
There
's
a
gaudy
big
grindstone
down
at
the
mill
,
and
we
'll
smouch

carve
the
things
on
it

and
file
out

pens
and
the
saw
on

*NL*
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
war
n't
no
slouch
of
an
idea
;
and
it
war
n't
no
slouch
of
a
*NL*
grindstone
nuther
;
but
we
allowed
we
'd
tackle
it
.
It
war
n't
quite
*NL*
midnight
yet
,
so
we
cleared
out
for
the
mill
,
leaving
Jim
at
work
.
We
*NL*
smouched
the
grindstone
,
and
set
out
to
roll
her
home
,
but
it
was
a
*NL*
most
nation
tough
job
.
Sometimes
,
do
what
we
could
,
we
could
n't
keep
*NL*
her
from
falling
over
,
and
she
come
mighty
near
mashing
us
every
time
.
*NL*
Tom
said
she
was
going
to
get
one
of
us
,
sure
,
before
we
got
through
.
*NL*
We
got
her
halfway
;
and
then
we
was
plumb
played
out
,
and
most
*NL*
drownded
with
sweat
.
We
see
it
war
n't
no
use
;
we
got
to
go
and
fetch
*NL*
Jim
.
So
he
raised
up
his
bed
and
slid
the
chain
off
of
the
bed-leg
,
*NL*
and
wrapt
it
round
and
round
his
neck
,
and
we
crawled
out
through
our
*NL*
hole
and
down
there
,
and
Jim
and
me
laid
into
that
grindstone
and
*NL*
walked
her
along
like
nothing
;
and
Tom
superintended
.
He
could
*NL*
out-superintend
any
boy
I
ever
see
.
He
knowed
how
to
do
everything
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
hole
was
pretty
big
,
but
it
war
n't
big
enough
to
get
the
*NL*
grindstone
through
;
but
Jim
he
took
the
pick
and
soon
made
it
big
*NL*
enough
.
Then
Tom
marked
out
them
things
on
it
with
the
nail
,
and
set
*NL*
Jim
to
work
on
them
,
with
the
nail
for
a
chisel
and
an
iron
bolt
from
*NL*
the
rubbage
in
the
lean-to
for
a
hammer
,
and
told
him
to
work
till
the
*NL*
rest
of
his
candle
quit
on
him
,
and
then
he
could
go
to
bed
,
and
hide
*NL*
the
grindstone
under
his
straw
tick
and
sleep
on
it
.
Then
we
helped
*NL*
him
fix
his
chain
back
on
the
bed-leg
,
and
was
ready
for
bed
*NL*
ourselves
.
But
Tom
thought
of
something
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
got
any
spiders
in
here
,
Jim
?

*NL*
*NL*
``

Tom
thought
a

,
and
says

Tom
was
stumped

he
studied

over

then
said

would

have

along
the

could

promised

Jim
said
he
would
``

tobacker
in

;
and
found
so
much
fault
with
it
,
and
with
the
*NL*
work
and
bother
of
raising
the
mullen
,
and
jew
's

harping
the
rats
,
and
*NL*
petting
and
flattering
up
the
snakes
and
spiders
and
things
,
on
top
of
*NL*
all
the
other
work
he
had
to
do
on
pens
,
and
inscriptions
,
and
*NL*
journals
,
and
things
,
which
made
it
more
trouble
and
worry
and
*NL*
responsibility
to
be
a
prisoner
than
anything
he
ever
undertook
,
that
*NL*
Tom
most
lost
all
patience
with
him
;
and
said
he
was
just
loadened
*NL*
down
with
more
gaudier
chances
than
a
prisoner
ever
had
in
the
world
*NL*
to
make
a
name
for
himself
,
and
yet
he
did
n't
know
enough
to
*NL*
appreciate
them
,
and
they
was
just
about
wasted
on
him
.
So
Jim
he
was
*NL*
sorry
,
and
said
he
would
n't
behave
so
no
more
,

then
me
and

CHAPTER
XXXIX
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
we
went
up
to
the
village
and
bought
a
wire
rat-trap
*NL*
and
fetched
it
down
,
and
unstopped
the
best
rat-hole
,
and
in
about
an
*NL*
hour
we
had
fifteen
of
the
bulliest
kind
of
ones
;
and
then
we
took
it
*NL*
and
put
it
in
a
safe
place
under
Aunt
Sally
's
bed
.
But
while
we
was
*NL*
gone
for
spiders
little
Thomas
Franklin
Benjamin
Jefferson
Elexander
*NL*
Phelps
found
it
there
,
and
opened
the
door
of
it
to
see
if
the
rats
*NL*
would
come
out
,
and
they
did
;
and
Aunt
Sally
she
come
in
,
and
when
we
*NL*
got
back
she
was
a-standing
on
top
of
the
bed
raising
Cain
,
and
the
*NL*
rats
was
doing
what
they
could
to
keep
off
the
dull
times
for
her
.
So
*NL*
she
took
and
dusted
us
both
with
the
hickry
,
and
we
was
as
much
as
two
*NL*
hours
catching
another
fifteen
or
sixteen
,
drat
that
meddlesome
cub
,
*NL*
and
they
war
n't
the
likeliest
,
nuther
,
because
the
first
haul
was
the
*NL*
pick
of
the
flock
.
I
never
see
a
likelier
lot
of
rats
than
what
that
*NL*
first
haul
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
got
a
splendid
stock
of
sorted
spiders
,
and
bugs
,
and
frogs
,
and
*NL*
caterpillars
,
and
one
thing
or
another
;
and
we
like
to
got
a
hornet
's
*NL*
nest
,
but
we
did
n't
.
The
family
was
at
home
.
We
did
n't
give
it
right
*NL*
up
,
but
stayed
with
them
as
long
as
we
could
;
because
we
allowed
we
'd
*NL*
tire
them
out
or
they
'd
got
to
tire
us
out
,
and
they
done
it
.
Then
we
*NL*
got
allycumpain
and
rubbed
on
the
places
,
and
was
pretty
near
all
*NL*
right
again
,
but
could
n't
set
down
convenient
.
And
so
we
went
for
the
*NL*
snakes
,
and
grabbed
a
couple
of
dozen
garters
and
house-snakes
,
and
*NL*
put
them
in
a
bag
,
and
put
it
in
our
room
,
and
by
that
time
it
was
*NL*
supper-time
,
and
a
rattling
good
honest
day
's
work
:
and
hungry
?
--
oh
,
*NL*
no
,
I
reckon
not
!
And
there
war
n't
a
blessed
snake
up
there
when
we
*NL*
went
back
--
we
did
n't
half
tie
the
sack
,
and
they
worked
out
somehow
,
*NL*
and
left
.
But
it
did
n't
matter
much
,
because
they
was
still
on
the
*NL*
premises
somewheres
.
So
we
judged
we
could
get
some
of
them
again
.
No
,
*NL*
there
war
n't
no
real
scarcity
of
snakes
about
the
house
for
a
*NL*
considerable
spell
.
You
'd
see
them
dripping
from
the
rafters
and
*NL*
places
every
now
and
then
;
and
they
generly
landed
in
your
plate
,
or
*NL*
down
the
back
of
your
neck
,
and
most
of
the
time
where
you
did
n't
want
*NL*
them
.
Well
,
they
was
handsome
and
striped
,
and
there
war
n't
no
harm
in
*NL*
a
million
of
them
;
but
that
never
made
no
difference
to
Aunt
Sally
;
*NL*
she
despised
snakes
,
be
the
breed
what
they
might
,
and
she
could
n't
*NL*
stand
them
no
way
you
could
fix
it
;
and
every
time
one
of
them
flopped
*NL*
down
on
her
,
it
did
n't
make
no
difference
what
she
was
doing
,
she
*NL*
would
just
lay
that
work
down
and
light
out
.
I
never
see
such
a
woman
.
*NL*
And
you
could
hear
her
whoop
to
Jericho
.
You
could
n't
get
her
to
take
*NL*
a-holt
of
one
of
them
with
the
tongs
.
And
if
she
turned
over
and
found
*NL*
one
in
bed
she
would
scramble
out
and
lift
a
howl
that
you
would
think
*NL*
the
house
was
afire
.
She
disturbed
the
old
man
so
that
he
said
he
*NL*
could
most
wish
there
had
n't
ever
been
no
snakes
created
.
Why
,
after
*NL*
every
last
snake
had
been
gone
clear
out
of
the
house
for
as
much
as
a
*NL*
week
Aunt
Sally
war
n't
over
it
yet
;
she
war
n't
near
over
it
;
when
she
*NL*
was
setting
thinking
about
something
you
could
touch
her
on
the
back
*NL*
of
her
neck
with
a
feather
and
she
would
jump
right
out
of
her
*NL*
stockings
.
It
was
very
curious
.
But
Tom
said
all
women
was
just
so
.
He
*NL*
said
they
was
made
that
way
for
some
reason
or
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
got
a
licking
every
time
one
of
our
snakes
come
in
her
way
,
and
she
*NL*
allowed
these
lickings
war
n't
nothing
to
what
she
would
do
if
we
ever
*NL*
loaded
up
the
place
again
with
them
.
I
did
n't
mind
the
lickings
,
*NL*
because
they
did
n't
amount
to
nothing
;
but
I
minded
the
trouble
we
had
*NL*
to
lay
in
another
lot
.
But
we
got
them
laid
in
,
and
all
the
other
*NL*
things
;
and
you
never
see
a
cabin
as
blithesome
as
Jim
's
was
when
*NL*
they
'd
all
swarm
out
for
music
and
go
for
him
.
Jim
did
n't
like
the
*NL*
spiders
,
and
the
spiders
did
n't
like
Jim
;
and
so
they
'd
lay
for
him
,
*NL*
and
make
it
mighty
warm
for
him
.
And
he
said
that
between
the
rats
and
*NL*
the
snakes
and
the
grindstone
there
war
n't
no
room
in
bed
for
him
,
*NL*
skasely
;
and
when
there
was
,
a
body
could
n't
sleep
,
it
was
so
lively
,
*NL*
and
it
was
always
lively
,
he
said
,
because
_
they
_
never
all
slept
at
*NL*
one
time
,
but
took
turn
about
,
so
when
the
snakes
was
asleep
the
rats
*NL*
was
on
deck
,
and
when
the
rats
turned
in
the
snakes
come
on
watch
,
so
*NL*
he
always
had
one
gang
under
him
,
in
his
way
,
and
t
`
other
gang
having
*NL*
a
circus
over
him
,
and
if
he
got
up
to
hunt
a
new
place
the
spiders
*NL*
would
take
a
chance
at
him
as
he
crossed
over
.
He
said
if
he
ever
got
*NL*
out
this
time
he
would
n't
ever
be
a
prisoner
again
,
not
for
a
salary
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
by
the
end
of
three
weeks
everything
was
in
pretty
good
shape
.
*NL*
The
shirt
was
sent
in
early
,
in
a
pie
,
and
every
time
a
rat
bit
Jim
he
*NL*
would
get
up
and
write
a
line
in
his
journal
whilst
the
ink
was
fresh
;
*NL*
the
pens
was
made
,
the
inscriptions
and
so
on
was
all
carved
on
the
*NL*
grindstone
;
the
bed-leg
was
sawed
in
two
,
and
we
had
et
up
the
*NL*
sawdust
,
and
it
give
us
a
most
amazing
stomach-ache
.
We
reckoned
we
*NL*
was
all
going
to
die
,
but
did
n't
.
It
was
the
most
undigestible
sawdust
*NL*
I
ever
see
;
and
Tom
said
the
same
.
But
as
I
was
saying
,
we
'd
got
all
*NL*
the
work
done
now
,
at
last
;
and
we
was
all
pretty
much
fagged
out
,
*NL*
too
,
but
mainly
Jim
.
The
old
man
had
wrote
a
couple
of
times
to
the
*NL*
plantation
below
Orleans
to
come
and
get
their
runaway
nigger
,
but
*NL*
had
n't
got
no
answer
,
because
there
war
n't
no
such
plantation
;
so
he
*NL*
allowed
he
would
advertise
Jim
in
the
St.
Louis
and
New
Orleans
*NL*
papers
;
and
when
he
mentioned
the
St.
Louis
ones
it
give
me
the
cold
*NL*
shivers
,
and
I
see
we
had
n't
no
time
to
lose
.
So
Tom
said
,
now
for
the
*NL*
nonnamous
letters
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
them
?
''
I
says
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Warnings
to
the
people
that
something
is
up
.
Sometimes
it
's
done
one
*NL*
way
,
sometimes
another
.
But
there
's
always
somebody
spying
around
that
*NL*
gives
notice
to
the
governor
of
the
castle
.
When
Louis
XVI
.
was
going
*NL*
to
light
out
of
the
Tooleries
a
servant-girl
done
it
.
It
's
a
very
good
*NL*
way
,
and
so
is
the
nonnamous
letters
.
We
'll
use
them
both
.
And
it
's
*NL*
usual
for
the
prisoner
's
mother
to
change
clothes
with
him
,
and
she
*NL*
stays
in
,
and
he
slides
out
in
her
clothes
.
We
'll
do
that
,
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
looky
here
,
Tom
,
what
do
we
want
to
_
warn
_
anybody
for
that
*NL*
something
's
up
?
Let
them
find
it
out
for
themselves
--
it
's
their
*NL*
lookout
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
know
;
but
you
ca
n't
depend
on
them
.
It
's
the
way
they
've
acted
*NL*
from
the
very
start
--
left
us
to
do
_
everything
_
.
They
're
so
confiding
*NL*
and
mullet-headed
they
do
n't
take
notice
of
nothing
at
all
.
So
if
we
*NL*
do
n't
_
give
_
them
notice
there
wo
n't
be
nobody
nor
nothing
to
*NL*
interfere
with
us
,
and
so
after
all
our
hard
work
and
trouble
this
*NL*
escape
'll
go
off
perfectly
flat
;
wo
n't
amount
to
nothing
--
wo
n't
be
*NL*
nothing
_
to
_
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
as
for
me
,
Tom
,
that
's
the
way
I
'd
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shucks
!
''
he
says
,
and
looked
disgusted
.
So
I
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
ai
n't
going
to
make
no
complaint
.
Any
way
that
suits
you
suits
*NL*
me
.
What
you
going
to
do
about
the
servant-girl
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
be
her
.
You
slide
in
,
in
the
middle
of
the
night
,
and
hook
*NL*
that
yaller
girl
's
frock
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Tom
,
that
'll
make
trouble
next
morning
;
because
,
of
course
,
she
*NL*
prob
`
bly
hai
n't
got
any
but
that
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
;
but
you
do
n't
want
it
but
fifteen
minutes
,
to
carry
the
*NL*
nonnamous
letter
and
shove
it
under
the
front
door
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
then
,
I
'll
do
it
;
but
I
could
carry
it
just
as
handy
in
my
*NL*
own
togs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
n't
look
like
a
servant-girl
_
then
_
,
would
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
but
there
wo
n't
be
nobody
to
see
what
I
look
like
,
_
anyway

.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
ai
n't
got
nothing
to
do
with
it
.
The
thing
for
us
to
do
is
just
*NL*
to
do
our
_
duty
_
,
and
not
worry
about
whether
anybody
_
sees
_
us
do
it
*NL*
or
not
.
Hai
n't
you
got
no
principle
at
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
I
ai
n't
saying
nothing
;
I
'm
the
servant-girl
.
Who
's
Jim
's
*NL*
mother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
his
mother
.
I
'll
hook
a
gown
from
Aunt
Sally
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
you
'll
have
to
stay
in
the
cabin
when
me
and
Jim
leaves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
much
.
I
'll
stuff
Jim
's
clothes
full
of
straw
and
lay
it
on
his
*NL*
bed
to
represent
his
mother
in
disguise
,
and
Jim
'll
take
the
nigger
*NL*
woman
's
gown
off
of
me
and
wear
it
,
and
we
'll
all
evade
together
.
When
*NL*
a
prisoner
of
style
escapes
it
's
called
an
evasion
.
It
's
always
called
*NL*
so
when
a
king
escapes
,
f
`
rinstance
.
And
the
same
with
a
king
's
son
;
*NL*
it
do
n't
make
no
difference
whether
he
's
a
natural
one
or
an
unnatural
*NL*
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
Tom
he
wrote
the
nonnamous
letter
,
and
I
smouched
the
yaller
*NL*
wench
's
frock
that
night
,
and
put
it
on
,
and
shoved
it
under
the
front
*NL*
door
,
the
way
Tom
told
me
to
.
It
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
_
Beware
.
Trouble
is
brewing
.
Keep
a
sharp
lookout
.
*NL*
UNKNOWN
FRIEND
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
Next
night
we
stuck
a
picture
,
which
Tom
drawed
in
blood
,
of
a
skull
*NL*
and
crossbones
on
the
front
door
;
and
next
night
another
one
of
a
*NL*
coffin
on
the
back
door
.
I
never
see
a
family
in
such
a
sweat
.
They
*NL*
could
n't
`
a
'
been
worse
scared
if
the
place
had
`
a
'
been
full
of
*NL*
ghosts
laying
for
them
behind
everything
and
under
the
beds
and
*NL*
shivering
through
the
air
.
If
a
door
banged
,
Aunt
Sally
she
jumped
and
*NL*
said
``
ouch
!
''
if
anything
fell
,
she
jumped
and
said
``
ouch
!
''
if
you
*NL*
happened
to
touch
her
,
when
she
war
n't
noticing
,
she
done
the
same
;
*NL*
she
could
n't
face
no
way
and
be
satisfied
,
because
she
allowed
there
*NL*
was
something
behind
her
every
time
--
so
she
was
always
a-whirling
*NL*
around
sudden
,
and
saying
``
ouch
,
''
and
before
she
'd
got
two-thirds
*NL*
around
she
'd
whirl
back
again
,
and
say
it
again
;
and
she
was
afraid
to
*NL*
go
to
bed
,
but
she
das
n't
set
up
.
So
the
thing
was
working
very
well
,
*NL*
Tom
said
;
he
said
he
never
see
a
thing
work
more
satisfactory
.
He
said
*NL*
it
showed
it
was
done
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
said
,
now
for
the
grand
bulge
!
So
the
very
next
morning
at
the
*NL*
streak
of
dawn
we
got
another
letter
ready
,
and
was
wondering
what
we
*NL*
better
do
with
it
,
because
we
heard
them
say
at
supper
they
was
going
*NL*
to
have
a
nigger
on
watch
at
both
doors
all
night
.
Tom
he
went
down
*NL*
the
lightning-rod
to
spy
around
;
and
the
nigger
at
the
back
door
was
*NL*
asleep
,
and
he
stuck
it
in
the
back
of
his
neck
and
come
back
.
This
*NL*
letter
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
_
Do
n't
betray
me
,
I
wish
to
be
your
friend
.
There
is
a
desprate
gang
*NL*
of
cutthroats
from
over
in
the
Indian
Territory
going
to
steal
your
*NL*
runaway
nigger
to-night
,
and
they
have
been
trying
to
scare
you
so
as
*NL*
you
will
stay
in
the
house
and
not
bother
them
.
I
am
one
of
the
gang
,
*NL*
but
have
got
religgion
and
wish
to
quit
it
and
lead
an
honest
life
*NL*
again
,
and
will
betray
the
helish
design
.
They
will
sneak
down
from
*NL*
northards
,
along
the
fence
,
at
midnight
exact
,
with
a
false
key
,
and
*NL*
go
in
the
nigger
's
cabin
to
get
him
.
I
am
to
be
off
a
piece
and
blow
a
*NL*
tin
horn
if
I
see
any
danger
;
but
stead
of
that
I

CHAPTER
XL
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
We
was
feeling
pretty
good
after
breakfast
,
and
took
my
canoe
and
went
*NL*
over
the
river
a-fishing
,
with
a
lunch
,
and
had
a
good
time
,
and
took
*NL*
a
look
at
the
raft
and
found
her
all
right
,
and
got
home
late
to
*NL*
supper
,
and
found
them
in
such
a
sweat
and
worry
they
did
n't
know
*NL*
which
end
they
was
standing
on
,
and
made
us
go
right
off
to
bed
the
*NL*
minute
we
was
done
supper
,
and
would
n't
tell
us
what
the
trouble
was
,
*NL*
and
never
let
on
a
word
about
the
new
letter
,
but
did
n't
need
to
,
*NL*
because
we
knowed
as
much
about
it
as
anybody
did
,
and
as
soon
as
we
*NL*
was
half
up-stairs
and
her
back
was
turned
we
slid
for
the
cellar
*NL*
cubboard
and
loaded
up
a
good
lunch
and
took
it
up
to
our
room
and
*NL*
went
to
bed
,
and
got
up
about
half
past
eleven
,
and
Tom
put
on
Aunt
*NL*
Sally
's
dress
that
he
stole
and
was
going
to
start
with
the
lunch
,
but
*NL*
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
's
the
butter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
laid
out
a
hunk
of
it
,
''
I
says
,
``
on
a
piece
of
a
corn-pone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
_
left
_
it
laid
out
,
then
--
it
ai
n't
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
can
get
along
without
it
,
''
I
says
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
can
get
along
_
with
_
it
,
too
,
''
he
says
;
``
just
you
slide
down
*NL*
cellar
and
fetch
it
.
And
then
mosey
right
down
the
lightning-rod
and
*NL*
come
along
.
I
'll
go
and
stuff
the
straw
into
Jim
's
clothes
to
*NL*
represent
his
mother
in
disguise
,
and
be
ready
to
_
ba
_
like
a
sheep
*NL*
and
shove
soon
as
you
get
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
out
he
went
,
and
down
cellar
went
I
.
The
hunk
of
butter
,
big
as
a
*NL*
person
's
fist
,
was
where
I
had
left
it
,
so
I
took
up
the
slab
of
*NL*
corn-pone
with
it
on
,
and
blowed
out
my
light
,
and
started
up-stairs
*NL*
very
stealthy
,
and
got
up
to
the
main
floor
all
right
,
but
here
comes
*NL*
Aunt
Sally
with
a
candle
,
and
I
clapped
the
truck
in
my
hat
,
and
*NL*
clapped
my
hat
on
my
head
,
and
the
next
second
she
see
me
;
and
she
*NL*
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
been
down
cellar
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
'm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
you
been
doing
down
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Noth
`
n.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Noth
`
n
!
_
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
'm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
what
possessed
you
to
go
down
there
this
time
of
night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
'm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
_
know
?
_
Do
n't
answer
me
that
way
.
Tom
,
I
want
to
know
what
*NL*
you
been
_
doing
_
down
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hai
n't
been
doing
a
single
thing
,
Aunt
Sally
,
I
hope
to
gracious
if
*NL*
I
have
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
reckoned
she
'd
let
me
go
now
,
and
as
a
generl
thing
she
would
;
but
I
*NL*
s
`
pose
there
was
so
many
strange
things
going
on
she
was
just
in
a
*NL*
sweat
about
every
little
thing
that
war
n't
yard-stick
straight
;
so
she
*NL*
says
,
very
decided
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
just
march
into
that
setting-room
and
stay
there
till
I
come
.
You
*NL*
been
up
to
something
you
no
business
to
,
and
I
lay
I
'll
find
out
what
*NL*
it
is
before
_
I
'm
_
done
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
she
went
away
as
I
opened
the
door
and
walked
into
the
*NL*
setting-room
.
My
,
but
there
was
a
crowd
there
!
Fifteen
farmers
,
and
*NL*
every
one
of
them
had
a
gun
.
I
was
most
powerful
sick
,
and
slunk
to
a
*NL*
chair
and
set
down
.
They
was
setting
around
,
some
of
them
talking
a
*NL*
little
,
in
a
low
voice
,
and
all
of
them
fidgety
and
uneasy
,
but
trying
*NL*
to
look
like
they
war
n't
;
but
I
knowed
they
was
,
because
they
was
*NL*
always
taking
off
their
hats
,
and
putting
them
on
,
and
scratching
*NL*
their
heads
,
and
changing
their
seats
,
and
fumbling
with
their
*NL*
buttons
.
I
war
n't
easy
myself
,
but
I
did
n't
take
my
hat
off
,
all
the
*NL*
same
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
wish
Aunt
Sally
would
come
,
and
get
done
with
me
,
and
lick
me
,
*NL*
if
she
wanted
to
,
and
let
me
get
away
and
tell
Tom
how
we
'd
overdone
*NL*
this
thing
,
and
what
a
thundering
hornet
's
nest
we
'd
got
ourselves
*NL*
into
,
so
we
could
stop
fooling
around
straight
off
,
and
clear
out
with
*NL*
Jim
before
these
rips
got
out
of
patience
and
come
for
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
she
come
and
begun
to
ask
me
questions
,
but
I
_
could
n't
_
*NL*
answer
them
straight
,
I
did
n't
know
which
end
of
me
was
up
;
because
*NL*
these
men
was
in
such
a
fidget
now
that
some
was
wanting
to
start
*NL*
right
_
now
_
and
lay
for
them
desperadoes
,
and
saying
it
war
n't
but
a
*NL*
few
minutes
to
midnight
;
and
others
was
trying
to
get
them
to
hold
on
*NL*
and
wait
for
the
sheep-signal
;
and
here
was
Aunty
pegging
away
at
the
*NL*
questions
,
and
me
a-shaking
all
over
and
ready
to
sink
down
in
my
*NL*
tracks
I
was
that
scared
;
and
the
place
getting
hotter
and
hotter
,
and
*NL*
the
butter
beginning
to
melt
and
run
down
my
neck
and
behind
my
ears
;
*NL*
and
pretty
soon
,
when
one
of
them
says
,
''
_
I
'm
_
for
going
and
getting
*NL*
in
the
cabin
_
first
_
and
right
_
now
_
,
and
catching
them
when
they
*NL*
come
,
''
I
most
dropped
;
and
a
streak
of
butter
come
a-trickling
down
my
*NL*
forehead
,
and
Aunt
Sally
she
see
it
,
and
turns
white
as
a
sheet
,
and
*NL*
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
the
land
's
sake
,
what
_
is
_
the
matter
with
the
child
?
He
's
got
*NL*
the
brain-fever
as
shore
as
you
're
born
,
and
they
're
oozing
out
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
everybody
runs
to
see
,
and
she
snatches
off
my
hat
,
and
out
comes
*NL*
the
bread
and
what
was
left
of
the
butter
,
and
she
grabbed
me
,
and
*NL*
hugged
me
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
what
a
turn
you
did
give
me
!
and
how
glad
and
grateful
I
am
it
*NL*
ai
n't
no
worse
;
for
luck
's
against
us
,
and
it
never
rains
but
it
*NL*
pours
,
and
when
I
see
that
truck
I
thought
we
'd
lost
you
,
for
I
knowed
*NL*
by
the
color
and
all
it
was
just
like
your
brains
would
be
if
--
Dear
,
*NL*
dear
,
whyd
`
nt
you
_
tell
_
me
that
was
what
you
'd
been
down
there
for
,
*NL*
_
I
_
would
n't
`
a
'
cared
.
Now
cler
out
to
bed
,
and
do
n't
lem
me
see
no
*NL*
more
of
you
till
morning
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
up-stairs
in
a
second
,
and
down
the
lightning-rod
in
another
*NL*
one
,
and
shinning
through
the
dark
for
the
lean-to
.
I
could
n't
hardly
*NL*
get
my
words
out
,
I
was
so
anxious
;
but
I
told
Tom
as
quick
as
I
could
*NL*
we
must
jump
for
it
now
,
and
not
a
minute
to
lose
--
the
house
full
of
*NL*
men
,
yonder
,
with
guns
!
*NL*
*NL*
His
eyes
just
blazed
;
and
he
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
--
is
that
so
?
_
Ai
n't
_
it
bully
!
Why
,
Huck
,
if
it
was
to
do
over
*NL*
again
,
I
bet
I
could
fetch
two
hundred
!
If
we
could
put
it
off
till
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hurry
!
_
hurry
!
_
''
I
says
.
``
Where
's
Jim
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Right
at
your
elbow
;
if
you
reach
out
your
arm
you
can
touch
him
.
*NL*
He
's
dressed
,
and
everything
's
ready
.
Now
we
'll
slide
out
and
give
the
*NL*
sheep-signal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
then
we
heard
the
tramp
of
men
coming
to
the
door
,
and
heard
them
*NL*
begin
to
fumble
with
the
padlock
,
and
heard
a
man
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
_
told
_
you
we
'd
be
too
soon
;
they
have
n't
come
--
the
door
is
locked
.
*NL*
Here
,
I
'll
lock
some
of
you
into
the
cabin
,
and
you
lay
for
'em
in
the
*NL*
dark
and
kill
'em
when
they
come
;
and
the
rest
scatter
around
a
piece
,
*NL*
and
listen
if
you
can
hear
'em
coming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
in
they
come
,
but
could
n't
see
us
in
the
dark
,
and
most
trod
on
us
*NL*
whilst
we
was
hustling
to
get
under
the
bed
.
But
we
got
under
all
*NL*
right
,
and
out
through
the
hole
,
swift
but
soft
--
Jim
first
,
me
next
,
*NL*
and
Tom
last
,
which
was
according
to
Tom
's
orders
.
Now
we
was
in
the
*NL*
lean-to
,
and
heard
trampings
close
by
outside
.
So
we
crept
to
the
*NL*
door
,
and
Tom
stopped
us
there
and
put
his
eye
to
the
crack
,
but
*NL*
could
n't
make
out
nothing
,
it
was
so
dark
;
and
whispered
and
said
he
*NL*
would
listen
for
the
steps
to
get
further
,
and
when
he
nudged
us
Jim
*NL*
must
glide
out
first
,
and
him
last
.
So
he
set
his
ear
to
the
crack
and
*NL*
listened
,
and
listened
,
and
listened
,
and
the
steps
a-scraping
around
*NL*
out
there
all
the
time
;
and
at
last
he
nudged
us
,
and
we
slid
out
,
and
*NL*
stooped
down
,
not
breathing
,
and
not
making
the
least
noise
,
and
*NL*
slipped
stealthy
towards
the
fence
in
Injun
file
,
and
got
to
it
all
*NL*
right
,
and
me
and
Jim
over
it
;
but
Tom
's
britches
catched
fast
on
a
*NL*
splinter
on
the
top
rail
,
and
then
he
hear
the
steps
coming
,
so
he
had
*NL*
to
pull
loose
,
which
snapped
the
splinter
and
made
a
noise
;
and
as
he
*NL*
dropped
in
our
tracks
and
started
somebody
sings
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
that
?
Answer
,
or
I
'll
shoot
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
we
did
n't
answer
;
we
just
unfurled
our
heels
and
shoved
.
Then
*NL*
there
was
a
rush
,
and
a
_
bang
,
_
_
bang
,
_
_
bang
!
_
and
the
bullets
fairly
*NL*
whizzed
around
us
!
We
heard
them
sing
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
they
are
!
They
've
broke
for
the
river
!
After
'em
,
boys
,
and
turn
*NL*
loose
the
dogs
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
here
they
come
,
full
tilt
.
We
could
hear
them
because
they
wore
*NL*
boots
and
yelled
,
but
we
did
n't
wear
no
boots
and
did
n't
yell
.
We
was
*NL*
in
the
path
to
the
mill
;
and
when
they
got
pretty
close
onto
us
we
*NL*
dodged
into
the
bush
and
let
them
go
by
,
and
then
dropped
in
behind
*NL*
them
.
They
'd
had
all
the
dogs
shut
up
,
so
they
would
n't
scare
off
the
*NL*
robbers
;
but
by
this
time
somebody
had
let
them
loose
,
and
here
they
*NL*
come
,
making
powwow
enough
for
a
million
;
but
they
was
our
dogs
;
so
we
*NL*
stopped
in
our
tracks
till
they
catched
up
;
and
when
they
see
it
*NL*
war
n't
nobody
but
us
,
and
no
excitement
to
offer
them
,
they
only
just
*NL*
said
howdy
,
and
tore
right
ahead
towards
the
shouting
and
clattering
;
*NL*
and
then
we
up-steam
again
,
and
whizzed
along
after
them
till
we
was
*NL*
nearly
to
the
mill
,
and
then
struck
up
through
the
bush
to
where
my
*NL*
canoe
was
tied
,
and
hopped
in
and
pulled
for
dear
life
towards
the
*NL*
middle
of
the
river
,
but
did
n't
make
no
more
noise
than
we
was
*NL*
obleeged
to
.
Then
we
struck
out
,
easy
and
comfortable
,
for
the
island
*NL*
where
my
raft
was
;
and
we
could
hear
them
yelling
and
barking
at
each
*NL*
other
all
up
and
down
the
bank
,
till
we
was
so
far
away
the
sounds
got
*NL*
dim
and
died
out
.
And
when
we
stepped
onto
the
raft
I
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
old
Jim
,
you
're
a
free
man
_
again
_
,
and
I
bet
you
wo
n't
ever
be
*NL*
a
slave
no
more
.

''
*NL*
*NL*
We
was
all
glad
as
we
could
be
,
but
Tom
was
the
gladdest
of
all
*NL*
because
he
had
a
bullet
in
the
calf
of
his
leg
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
me
and
Jim
heard
that
we
did
n't
feel
as
brash
as
what
we
did
*NL*
before
.
It
was
hurting
him
considerable
,
and
bleeding
;
so
we
laid
him
*NL*
in
the
wigwam
and
tore
up
one
of
the
duke
's
shirts
for
to
bandage
him
,
*NL*
but
he
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gim
me
the
rags
;
I
can
do
it
myself
.
Do
n't
stop
now
;
do
n't
fool
around
*NL*
here
,
and
the
evasion
booming
along
so
handsome
;
man
the
sweeps
,
and
*NL*
set
her
loose
!
Boys
,
we
done
it
elegant
!
--
`
deed
we
did
.
I
wish
_
we
'd
_
*NL*
`
a
'
had
the
handling
of
Louis
XVI.
,
there
would
n't
`
a

been

`
Son

Saint
Louis

wrote
down
in
_
his

;
no
,
*NL*
sir
,
we
'd
`
a
'
whooped
him
over
the
_
border
_
--
that
's
what
we
'd
`
a
'
done
*NL*
with
_
him

--
and
done
it
just
as
slick
as
nothing
at
all
,
too
.
Man
the
*NL*
sweeps
--
man
the
sweeps
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
But
me
and
Jim
was
consulting
--
and
thinking
.
And
after
we
'd
thought
a
*NL*
minute
,
I
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
it
,
Jim
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
den
,
dis
is
de
way
it
look
to

Huck

Ef

?
Is

*NL*
like

Tom
Sawyer
?
Would

?
You

_
he
would

_
Well

,
*NL*
den
,

_
Jim
_
gywne
to

No
,
sah
--
I
doan
'
budge
a
step
out
'n
dis
*NL*
place
`
dout
a
_
doctor
_
;
not
if
it
's
forty
year
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
knowed
he
was
white
inside
,
and
I
reckoned
he
'd
say
what
he
did
*NL*
say
--
so
it
was
all
right
now
,
and
I
told
Tom
I
was
a-going
for
a
*NL*
doctor
.
He
raised
considerable
row
about
it
,
but
me
and
Jim
stuck
to
*NL*
it
and
would
n't
budge
;
so
he
was
for
crawling
out
and
setting
the
raft
*NL*
loose
himself
;
but
we
would
n't
let
him
.
Then
he
give
us
a
piece
of
his
*NL*
mind
,
but
it
did
n't
do
no
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
when
he
sees
me
getting
the
canoe
ready
,
he
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
if
you
're
bound
to
go
,
I
'll
tell
you
the
way
to
do
when
*NL*
you
get
to
the
village
.
Shut
the
door
and
blindfold
the
doctor
tight
*NL*
and
fast
,
and
make
him
swear
to
be
silent
as
the
grave
,
and
put
a
*NL*
purse
full
of
gold
in
his
hand
,
and
then
take
and
lead
him
all
around
*NL*
the
back
alleys
and
everywheres
in
the
dark
,
and
then
fetch
him
here
*NL*
in
the
canoe
,
in
a
roundabout
way
amongst
the
islands
,
and
search
him
*NL*
and
take
his
chalk
away
from
him
,
and
do
n't
give
it
back
to
him
till
*NL*
you
get
him
back
to
the
village
,
or
else
he
will
chalk
this
raft
so
he
*NL*
can
find
it
again
.
It
's
the
way
they
all
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
I
said
I
would
,
and
left
,
and
Jim
was
to
hide
in
the
woods
when
he
*NL*
see
the
doctor
coming
till
he
was
gone
again
.

CHAPTER
XLI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
was
an
old
man
;
a
very
nice
,
kind-looking
old
man
when
I
*NL*
got
him
up
.
I
told
him
me
and
my
brother
was
over
on
Spanish
Island
*NL*
hunting
yesterday
afternoon
,
and
camped
on
a
piece
of
a
raft
we
found
,
*NL*
and
about
midnight
he
must
`
a
'
kicked
his
gun
in
his
dreams
,
for
it
*NL*
went
off
and
shot
him
in
the
leg
,
and
we
wanted
him
to
go
over
there
*NL*
and
fix
it
and
not
say
nothing
about
it
,
nor
let
anybody
know
,
because
*NL*
we
wanted
to
come
home
this
evening
and
surprise
the
folks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
your
folks
?
''
he
says
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Phelpses
,
down
yonder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
he
says
.
And
after
a
minute
,
he
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
'd
you
say
he
got
shot
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
had
a
dream
,
''
I
says
,
``
and
it
shot
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Singular
dream
,
''
he
says
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
lit
up
his
lantern
,
and
got
his
saddle-bags
,
and
we
started
.
But
*NL*
when
he
see
the
canoe
he
did
n't
like
the
look
of
her
--
said
she
was
big
*NL*
enough
for
one
,
but
did
n't
look
pretty
safe
for
two
.
I
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
need
n't
be
afeard
,
sir
,
she
carried
the
three
of
us
easy
*NL*
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
three
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
me
and
Sid
,
and
--
and
--
and
_
the
guns
_
;
that
's
what
I
mean
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
he
says
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
put
his
foot
on
the
gunnel
and
rocked
her
,
and
shook
his
head
,
*NL*
and
said
he
reckoned
he
'd
look
around
for
a
bigger
one
.
But
they
was
*NL*
all
locked
and
chained
;
so
he
took
my
canoe
,
and
said
for
me
to
wait
*NL*
till
he
come
back
,
or
I
could
hunt
around
further
,
or
maybe
I
better
*NL*
go
down
home
and
get
them
ready
for
the
surprise
if
I
wanted
to
.
But
I
*NL*
said
I
did
n't
;
so
I
told
him
just
how
to
find
the
raft
,
and
then
he
*NL*
started
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
struck
an
idea
pretty
soon
.
I
says
to
myself
,
spos
'n
he
ca
n't
fix
*NL*
that
leg
just
in
three
shakes
of
a
sheep
's
tail
,
as
the
saying
is
?
*NL*
spos
'n
it
takes
him
three
or
four
days
?
What
are
we
going
to
do
?
--
lay
*NL*
around
there
till
he
lets
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
?
No
,
sir
;
I
know
what
*NL*
_
I
'll
_
do
.
I
'll
wait
,
and
when
he
comes
back
if
he
says
he
's
got
to
go
*NL*
any
more
I
'll
get
down
there
,
too
,
if
I
swim
;
and
we
'll
take
and
tie
*NL*
him
,
and
keep
him
,
and
shove
out
down
the
river
;
and
when
Tom
's
done
*NL*
with
him
we
'll
give
him
what
it
's
worth
,
or
all
we
got
,
and
then
let
*NL*
him
get
ashore
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
then
I
crept
into
a
lumber-pile
to
get
some
sleep
;
and
next
time
I
*NL*
waked
up
the
sun
was
away
up
over
my
head
!
I
shot
out
and
went
for
the
*NL*
doctor
's
house
,
but
they
told
me
he
'd
gone
away
in
the
night
some
time
*NL*
or
other
,
and
war
n't
back
yet
.
Well
,
thinks
I
,
that
looks
powerful
bad
*NL*
for
Tom
,
and
I
'll
dig
out
for
the
island
right
off
.
So
away
I
shoved
,
*NL*
and
turned
the
corner
,
and
nearly
rammed
my
head
into
Uncle
Silas
's
*NL*
stomach
!
He
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
_
Tom
!
_
Where
you
been
all
this
time
,
you
rascal
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
I
_
hai
n't
been
nowheres
,
''
I
says
,
``
only
just
hunting
for
the
runaway
*NL*
nigger
--
me
and
Sid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
where
ever
did
you
go
?
''
he
says
.
``
Your
aunt
's
been
mighty
*NL*
uneasy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
need
n't
,
''
I
says
,
``
because
we
was
all
right
.
We
followed
the
men
*NL*
and
the
dogs
,
but
they
outrun
us
,
and
we
lost
them
;
but
we
thought
we
*NL*
heard
them
on
the
water
,
so
we
got
a
canoe
and
took
out
after
them
and
*NL*
crossed
over
,
but
could
n't
find
nothing
of
them
;
so
we
cruised
along
*NL*
up-shore
till
we
got
kind
of
tired
and
beat
out
;
and
tied
up
the
canoe
*NL*
and
went
to
sleep
,
and
never
waked
up
till
about
an
hour
ago
;
then
we
*NL*
paddled
over
here
to
hear
the
news
,
and
Sid
's
at
the
post-office
to
*NL*
see
what
he
can
hear
,
and
I
'm
a-branching
out
to
get
something
to
eat
*NL*
for
us
,
and
then
we
're
going
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
then
we
went
to
the
post-office
to
get
``
Sid
''
;
but
just
as
I
*NL*
suspicioned
,
he
war
n't
there
;
so
the
old
man
he
got
a
letter
out
of
*NL*
the
office
,
and
we
waited
awhile
longer
,
but
Sid
did
n't
come
;
so
the
*NL*
old
man
said
,
come
along
,
let
Sid
foot
it
home
,
or
canoe
it
,
when
he
*NL*
got
done
fooling
around
--
but
we
would
ride
.
I
could
n't
get
him
to
let
*NL*
me
stay
and
wait
for
Sid
;
and
he
said
there
war
n't
no
use
in
it
,
and
I
*NL*
must
come
along
,
and
let
Aunt
Sally
see
we
was
all
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
got
home
Aunt
Sally
was
that
glad
to
see
me
she
laughed
and
*NL*
cried
both
,
and
hugged
me
,
and
give
me
one
of
them
lickings
of
hern
*NL*
that
do
n't
amount
to
shucks
,
and
said
she
'd
serve
Sid
the
same
when
he
*NL*
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
place
was
plum
full
of
farmers
and
farmers
'
wives
,
to
dinner
;
*NL*
and
such
another
clack
a
body
never
heard
.
Old
Mrs.
Hotchkiss
was
the
*NL*
worst
;
her
tongue
was
a-going
all
the
time
.
She
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``

away
up

the

and
you

''
She
stopped
,
looking
kind
of
wondering
,
and
then
she
turned
*NL*
her
head
around
slow
,
and
when
her
eye
lit
on
me
--
I
got
up
and
took
a
*NL*
walk
.
*NL*
*NL*
Says
I
to
myself
,
I
can
explain
better
how
we
come
to
not
be
in
that
*NL*
room
this
morning
if
I
go
out
to
one
side
and
study
over
it
a
little
.
*NL*
So
I
done
it
.
But
I
das
n't
go
fur
,
or
she
'd
`
a
'
sent
for
me
.
And
when
*NL*
it
was
late
in
the
day
the
people
all
went
,
and
then
I
come
in
and
*NL*
told
her
the
noise
and
shooting
waked
up
me
and
``
Sid
,
''
and
the
door
*NL*
was
locked
,
and
we
wanted
to
see
the
fun
,
so
we
went
down
the
*NL*
lightning-rod
,
and
both
of
us
got
hurt
a
little
,
and
we
did
n't
never
*NL*
want
to
try
_
that
_
no
more
.
And
then
I
went
on
and
told
her
all
what
I
*NL*
told
Uncle
Silas
before
;
and
then
she
said
she
'd
forgive
us
,
and
maybe
*NL*
it
was
all
right
enough
anyway
,
and
about
what
a
body
might
expect
of
*NL*
boys
,
for
all
boys
was
a
pretty
harum-scarum
lot
as
fur
as
she
could
*NL*
see
;
and
so
,
as
long
as
no
harm
had
n't
come
of
it
,
she
judged
she
*NL*
better
put
in
her
time
being
grateful
we
was
alive
and
well
and
she
*NL*
had
us
still
,
stead
of
fretting
over
what
was
past
and
done
.
So
then
*NL*
she
kissed
me
,
and
patted
me
on
the
head
,
and
dropped
into
a
kind
of
a
*NL*
brown-study
;
and
pretty
soon
jumps
up
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
lawsamercy
,
it
's
most
night

and
Sid
not
come
yet

What
_
has
_
*NL*
become
of
that
boy
?

*NL*
*NL*
I
see
my
chance
;
so
I
skips
up
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
run
right
up
to
town
and
get
him
,
''
I
says
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
you
wo
n't
,
''
she
says
.
``
You
'll
stay
right
wher
'
you
are
;
_
one
's
_
*NL*
enough
to
be
lost
at
a
time
.
If
he
ai
n't
here
to
supper
,
your
uncle
*NL*
'll
go

''
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
he
war
n't
there
to
supper
;
so
right
after
supper
uncle
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
come
back
about
ten
a
little
bit
uneasy
;
had
n't
run
across
Tom
's
*NL*
track
.
Aunt
Sally
was
a
good
_
deal
_
uneasy
;
but
Uncle
Silas
he
said
*NL*
there
war
n't
no
occasion
to
be
--
boys
will
be
boys
,
he
said
,
and
you
'll
*NL*
see
this
one
turn
up
in
the
morning
all
sound
and
right
.
So
she
had
to
*NL*
be
satisfied
.
But
she
said
she
'd
set
up
for
him
awhile
anyway
,
and
*NL*
keep
a
light
burning
so
he
could
see
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
when
I
went
up
to
bed
she
come
up
with
me
and
fetched
her
*NL*
candle
,
and
tucked
me
in
,
and
mothered
me
so
good
I
felt
mean
,
and
*NL*
like
I
could
n't
look
her
in
the
face
;
and
she
set
down
on
the
bed
and
*NL*
talked
with
me
a
long
time
,
and
said
what
a
splendid
boy
Sid
was
,
and
*NL*
did
n't
seem
to
want
to
ever
stop
talking
about
him
;
and
kept
asking
me
*NL*
every
now
and
then
if
I
reckoned
he
could
`
a
'
got
lost
,
or
hurt
,
or
*NL*
maybe
drownded
,
and
might
be
laying
at
this
minute
somewheres
*NL*
suffering
or
dead
,
and
she
not
by
him
to
help
him
,
and
so
the
tears
*NL*
would
drip
down
silent
,
and
I
would
tell
her
that
Sid
was
all
right
,
*NL*
and
would
be
home
in
the
morning
,
sure
;
and
she
would
squeeze
my
hand
,
*NL*
or
maybe
kiss
me
,
and
tell
me
to
say
it
again
,
and
keep
on
saying
it
,
*NL*
because
it
done
her
good
,
and
she
was
in
so
much
trouble
.
And
when
she
*NL*
was
going
away
she
looked
down
in
my
eyes
so
steady
and
gentle
,
and
*NL*
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
door
ai
n't
going
to
be
locked
,

,
and
there
's
the
window
and
*NL*
the
rod
;
but
you
'll
be
good
,
_
wo
n't
_
you
?
And
you
wo
n't
go
?
For
_
my
_
*NL*
sake

''
*NL*
*NL*
Laws
knows
I
_
wanted
_
to
go
bad
enough
to
see
about
Tom
,
and
was
all
*NL*
intending
to
go
;
but
after
that
I
would
n't
`
a
'
went
,
not
for
kingdoms
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
was
on
my
mind
and
Tom
was
on
my
mind
,
so
I
slept
very
*NL*
restless
.
And
twice
I
went
down
the
rod
away
in
the
night
,
and
slipped
*NL*
around
front
,
and
see
her
setting
there
by
her
candle
in
the
window
*NL*
with
her
eyes
towards
the
road
and
the
tears
in
them
;
and
I
wished
I
*NL*
could
do
something
for
her
,
but
I
could
n't
,
only
to
swear
that
I
*NL*
would
n't
never
do
nothing
to
grieve
her
any
more
.
And
the
third
time
I
*NL*
waked
up
at
dawn
,
and
slid
down
,
and
she
was
there
yet
,
and
her
candle
*NL*
was
most
out
,
and
her
old
gray
head
was
resting
on
her
hand
,
and
she
*NL*
was
asleep

CHAPTER
XLII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
was
uptown
again
before
breakfast
,
but
could
n't
get
no
*NL*
track
of
Tom
;
and
both
of
them
set
at
the
table
thinking
,
and
not
*NL*
saying
nothing
,
and
looking
mournful
,
and
their
coffee
getting
cold
,
*NL*
and
not
eating
anything
.
And
by
and
by
the
old
man
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
I
give
you
the
letter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
letter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
one
I
got
yesterday
out
of
the
post-office
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
you
did
n't
give
me
no
letter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
must
`
a
'
forgot
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
rummaged
his
pockets
,
and
then
went
off
somewheres
where
he
had
*NL*
laid
it
down
,
and
fetched
it
,
and
give
it
to
her
.
She
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
it
's
from
St.
Petersburg
--
it
's
from
Sis
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
allowed
another
walk
would
do
me
good
;
but
I
could
n't
stir
.
But
*NL*
before
she
could
break
it
open
she
dropped
it
and
run
--
for
she
see
*NL*
something
.
And
so
did
I
.
It
was
Tom
Sawyer
on
a
mattress
;
and
that
old
*NL*
doctor
;
and
Jim
,
in
_
her
_
calico
dress
,
with
his
hands
tied
behind
*NL*
him
;
and
a
lot
of
people
.
I
hid
the
letter
behind
the
first
thing
that
*NL*
come
handy
,
and
rushed
.
She
flung
herself
at
Tom
,
crying
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
he
's
dead
,
he
's
dead
,
I
know
he
's
dead
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Tom
he
turned
his
head
a
little
,
and
muttered
something
or
other
,
*NL*
which
showed
he
war
n't
in
his
right
mind
;
then
she
flung
up
her
hands
,
*NL*
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
alive
,
thank
God
!
And
that
's
enough
!
''
and
she
snatched
a
kiss
of
*NL*
him
,
and
flew
for
the
house
to
get
the
bed
ready
,
and
scattering
*NL*
orders
right
and
left
at
the
niggers
and
everybody
else
,
as
fast
as
*NL*
her
tongue
could
go
,
every
jump
of
the
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
followed
the
men
to
see
what
they
was
going
to
do
with
Jim
;
and
the
*NL*
old
doctor
and
Uncle
Silas
followed
after
Tom
into
the
house
.
The
men
*NL*
was
very
huffy
,
and
some
of
them
wanted
to
hang
Jim
for
an
example
to
*NL*
all
the
other
niggers
around
there
,
so
they
would
n't
be
trying
to
run
*NL*
away
like
Jim
done
,
and
making
such
a
raft
of
trouble
,
and
keeping
a
*NL*
whole
family
scared
most
to
death
for
days
and
nights
.
But
the
others
*NL*
said
,
do
n't
do
it
,
it
would
n't
answer
at
all
;
he
ai
n't
our
nigger
,
and
*NL*
his
owner
would
turn
up
and
make
us
pay
for
him
,
sure
.
So
that
cooled
*NL*
them
down
a
little
,
because
the
people
that
's
always
the
most
anxious
*NL*
for
to
hang
a
nigger
that
hai
n't
done
just
right
is
always
the
very
*NL*
ones
that
ai
n't
the
most
anxious
to
pay
for
him
when
they
've
got
their
*NL*
satisfaction
out
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
cussed
Jim
considerble
,
though
,
and
give
him
a
cuff
or
two
side
*NL*
the
head
once
in
a
while
,
but
Jim
never
said
nothing
,
and
he
never
let
*NL*
on
to
know
me
,
and
they
took
him
to
the
same
cabin
,
and
put
his
own
*NL*
clothes
on
him
,
and
chained
him
again
,
and
not
to
no
bed-leg
this
*NL*
time
,
but
to
a
big
staple
drove
into
the
bottom
log
,
and
chained
his
*NL*
hands
,
too
,
and
both
legs
,
and
said
he
war
n't
to
have
nothing
but
*NL*
bread
and
water
to
eat
after
this
till
his
owner
come
,
or
he
was
sold
*NL*
at
auction
because
he
did
n't
come
in
a
certain
length
of
time
,
and
*NL*
filled
up
our
hole
,
and
said
a
couple
of
farmers
with
guns
must
stand
*NL*
watch
around
about
the
cabin
every
night
,
and
a
bulldog
tied
to
the
*NL*
door
in
the
daytime
;
and
about
this
time
they
was
through
with
the
job
*NL*
and
was
tapering
off
with
a
kind
of
generl
good-by
cussing
,
and
then
*NL*
the
old
doctor
comes
and
takes
a
look
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
no
rougher
on
him
than
you
're
obleeged
to
,
because
he
ai
n't
*NL*
a
bad
nigger
.
When
I
got
to
where
I
found
the
boy
I
see
I
could
n't
cut
*NL*
the
bullet
out
without
some
help
,
and
he
war
n't
in
no
condition
for
me
*NL*
to
leave
to
go
and
get
help
;
and
he
got
a
little
worse
and
a
little
*NL*
worse
,
and
after
a
long
time
he
went
out
of
his
head
,
and
would
n't
let
*NL*
me
come
a-nigh
him
any
more
,
and
said
if
I
chalked
his
raft
he
'd
kill
*NL*
me
,
and
no
end
of
wild
foolishness
like
that
,
and
I
see
I
could
n't
do
*NL*
anything
at
all
with
him
;
so
I
says
,
I
got
to
have
_
help
_
somehow
;
and
*NL*
the
minute
I
says
it
out
crawls
this
nigger
from
somewheres
and
says
*NL*
he
'll
help
,
and
he
done
it
,
too
,
and
done
it
very
well
.
Of
course
I
*NL*
judged
he
must
be
a
runaway
nigger
,
and
there
I
_
was
!
_
and
there
I
had
*NL*
to
stick
right
straight
along
all
the
rest
of
the
day
and
all
night
.
*NL*
It
was
a
fix
,
I
tell
you
!
I
had
a
couple
of
patients
with
the
chills
,
*NL*
and
of
course
I
'd
of
liked
to
run
up
to
town
and
see
them
,
but
I
*NL*
das
n't
,
because
the
nigger
might
get
away
,
and
then
I
'd
be
to
blame
;
*NL*
and
yet
never
a
skiff
come
close
enough
for
me
to
hail
.
So
there
I
had
*NL*
to
stick
plumb
until
daylight
this
morning
;
and
I
never
see
a
nigger
*NL*
that
was
a
better
nuss
or
faithfuler
,
and
yet
he
was
risking
his
*NL*
freedom
to
do
it
,
and
was
all
tired
out
,
too
,
and
I
see
plain
enough
*NL*
he
'd
been
worked
main
hard
lately
.
I
liked
the
nigger
for
that
;
I
tell
*NL*
you
,
gentlemen
,
a
nigger
like
that
is
worth
a
thousand
dollars
--
and
*NL*
kind
treatment
,
too
.
I
had
everything
I
needed
,
and
the
boy
was
doing
*NL*
as
well
there
as
he
would
`
a
'
done
at
home
--
better
,
maybe
,
because
it
*NL*
was
so
quiet
;
but
there
I
_
was
_
,
with
both
of
'm
on
my
hands
,
and
*NL*
there
I
had
to
stick
till
about
dawn
this
morning
;
then
some
men
in
a
*NL*
skiff
come
by
,
and
as
good
luck
would
have
it
the
nigger
was
setting
*NL*
by
the
pallet
with
his
head
propped
on
his
knees
sound
asleep
;
so
I
*NL*
motioned
them
in
quiet
,
and
they
slipped
up
on
him
and
grabbed
him
and
*NL*
tied
him
before
he
knowed
what
he
was
about
,
and
we
never
had
no
*NL*
trouble
.
And
the
boy
being
in
a
kind
of
a
flighty
sleep
,
too
,
we
*NL*
muffled
the
oars
and
hitched
the
raft
on
,
and
towed
her
over
very
nice
*NL*
and
quiet
,
and
the
nigger
never
made
the
least
row
nor
said
a
word
*NL*
from
the
start
.
He
ai
n't
no
bad
nigger
,
gentlemen
;
that
's
what
I
think
*NL*
about
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Somebody
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
sounds
very
good
,
doctor
,
I
'm
obleeged
to
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
others
softened
up
a
little
,
too
,
and
I
was
mighty
thankful
*NL*
to
that
old
doctor
for
doing
Jim
that
good
turn
;
and
I
was
glad
it
was
*NL*
according
to
my
judgment
of
him
,
too
;
because
I
thought
he
had
a
good
*NL*
heart
in
him
and
was
a
good
man
the
first
time
I
see
him
.
Then
they
*NL*
all
agreed
that
Jim
had
acted
very
well
,
and
was
deserving
to
have
*NL*
some
notice
took
of
it
,
and
reward
.
So
every
one
of
them
promised
,
*NL*
right
out
and
hearty
,
that
they
would
n't
cuss
him
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
they
come
out
and
locked
him
up
.
I
hoped
they
was
going
to
say
he
*NL*
could
have
one
or
two
of
the
chains
took
off
,
because
they
was
rotten
*NL*
heavy
,
or
could
have
meat
and
greens
with
his
bread
and
water
;
but
*NL*
they
did
n't
think
of
it
,
and
I
reckoned
it
war
n't
best
for
me
to
mix
*NL*
in
,
but
I
judged
I
'd
get
the
doctor
's
yarn
to
Aunt
Sally
somehow
or
*NL*
other
as
soon
as
I
'd
got
through
the
breakers
that
was
laying
just
*NL*
ahead
of
me
--
explanations
,
I
mean
,
of
how
I
forgot
to
mention
about
*NL*
Sid
being
shot
when
I
was
telling
how
him
and
me
put
in
that
dratted
*NL*
night
paddling
around
hunting
the
runaway
nigger
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
had
plenty
time
.
Aunt
Sally
she
stuck
to
the
sick-room
all
day
*NL*
and
all
night
,
and
every
time
I
see
Uncle
Silas
mooning
around
I
*NL*
dodged
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
morning
I
heard
Tom
was
a
good
deal
better
,
and
they
said
Aunt
*NL*
Sally
was
gone
to
get
a
nap
.
So
I
slips
to
the
sick-room
,
and
if
I
*NL*
found
him
awake
I
reckoned
we
could
put
up
a
yarn
for
the
family
that
*NL*
would
wash
.
But
he
was
sleeping
,
and
sleeping
very
peaceful
,
too
;
and
*NL*
pale
,
not
fire-faced
the
way
he
was
when
he
come
.
So
I
set
down
and
*NL*
laid
for
him
to
wake
.
In
about
half
an
hour
Aunt
Sally
comes
gliding
*NL*
in
,
and
there
I
was
,
up
a
stump
again
!
She
motioned
me
to
be
still
,
*NL*
and
set
down
by
me
,
and
begun
to
whisper
,
and
said
we
could
all
be
*NL*
joyful
now
,
because
all
the
symptoms
was
first-rate
,
and
he
'd
been
*NL*
sleeping
like
that
for
ever
so
long
,
and
looking
better
and
peacefuler
*NL*
all
the
time
,
and
ten
to
one
he
'd
wake
up
in
his
right
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
we
set
there
watching
,
and
by
and
by
he
stirs
a
bit
,
and
opened
his
*NL*
eyes
very
natural
,
and
takes
a
look
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hello
!
--
why
,
I
'm
at
_
home
!
_
How
's
that
?
Where
's
the
raft
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
right
,
''
I
says
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
_
Jim
?
_
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
same
,
''
I
says
,
but
could
n't
say
it
pretty
brash
.
But
he
never
*NL*
noticed
,
but
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
!
Splendid
!
_
Now
_
we
're
all
right
and
safe
!
Did
you
tell
Aunty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
going
to
say
yes
;
but
she
chipped
in
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
what
,
Sid
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
about
the
way
the
whole
thing
was
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
whole
thing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
_
the
_
whole
thing
.
There
ai
n't
but
one
;
how
we
set
the
runaway
*NL*
nigger
free
--
me
and
Tom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
land
!
Set
the
run
--
What
_
is
_
the
child
talking
about
!
Dear
,
*NL*
dear

of
his
head
again
!

*NL*
*NL*
''
_
No
_
,
I
ai
n't
out
of
my
HEAD
;
I
know
all
what
I
'm
talking
about
.
We
*NL*
_
did
_
set
him
free

me
and
Tom

We
laid
out
to
do
it
,
and
we
_
done
_
*NL*
it
.
And
we
done
it
elegant
,
too
.
''
He
'd
got
a
start
,
and
she
never
*NL*
checked
him
up
,
just
set
and
stared
and
stared
,
and
let
him
clip
*NL*
along
,
and
I
see
it
war
n't
no
use
for
_
me
_
to
put
in
.
``
Why
,
Aunty
,
it
*NL*
cost
us
a
power
of
work
--
weeks
of
it
--
hours
and
hours
,
every
night
,
*NL*
whilst
you
was
all
asleep
.
And
we
had
to
steal
candles
,
and
the
sheet
,
*NL*
and
the
shirt
,
and
your
dress
,
and
spoons
,
and
tin
plates

and
the
warming-pan

the
grindstone

*NL*
just
no

of
things

you

work
it
was
to
make

one
thing
or
another
,
and
*NL*
you
ca
n't
think
half
the
fun
it
was

And
we
had
to
make
up
the
*NL*
pictures
of
coffins
and
things
,
and
nonnamous
letters
from
the
*NL*
robbers
,
and
get
up

down
the
lightning-rod

dig
the
hole
into

the
cabin

make
the
rope
ladder

send
it
in
cooked
up
in

send
in

*NL*
*NL*
``

and
load
up
the
cabin
with
rats
and
snake
's
and
so
on
,
for
company
*NL*
for
Jim
;
and
then
you
kept
Tom
here
so
long
with
the
butter
in
his
hat
*NL*
that
you
come
near
spiling
the
whole
business
,
because
the
men
come
*NL*
before
we
was
out
of
the
cabin
,
and
we
had
to
rush
,
and
they
heard
us
*NL*
and
let
drive
at
us
,
and
I
got
my
share
,

we
dodged
out
of
the
path

let
them
go
by
,

when
the
dogs
come
they
war
n't
interested
in
*NL*
us
,
but
went
for
the
most
noise
,
and
we
got
our
canoe
,
and
made
for
*NL*
the
raft
,
and
was
all
safe
,
and
Jim
was
a
free
man
,
and
we
done
it
all
*NL*
by
ourselves

*NL*
*NL*

a-chipping

spitting
fire
all

along

both

going
it
at

Tom
rose
square
up
in

with
his

hot

his

opening
*NL*
and
shutting
like
gills
,
and
sings
out
to
me
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
hai
n't
no
_
right
_
to
shut
him
up
!
_
Shove
!
_
--
and
do
n't
you
lose
a
*NL*
minute
.
Turn
him
loose
!
he
ai
n't
no
slave
;
he
's
as
free
as
any
cretur
*NL*
that
walks
this
earth
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
_
does
_
the
child
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
every
word
I

say
_
,
Aunt
Sally
,
and
if
somebody
do
n't
go

*NL*
_
I
'll
_
go

I
've
knowed
him
all
his
life
,
and
so
has
Tom
,
there
.
Old
*NL*
Miss
Watson
died
two
months
ago
,
and
she
was
ashamed
she
ever
was
*NL*
going
to
sell
him
down
the
river
,
and
_
said
_
so
;
and
she
set
him
free
*NL*
in
her
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
what
on
earth
did
_
you
_
want
to
set
him
free
for
,
seeing
he
was
*NL*
already
free
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
_
is
_
a
question
,
I
must
say
;
and
_
just
_
like
women
!
Why
,
I
*NL*
wanted
the
_
adventure
_
of
it
;
and
I
'd
`
a
'
waded
neck-deep
in
blood
*NL*
to
--
goodness
alive
,
_
Aunt
Polly
!
''
_
*NL*
*NL*
If
she
war
n't
standing
right
there
,
just
inside
the
door
,
looking
as
*NL*
sweet
and
contented
as
an
angel
half
full
of
pie
,
I
wish
I
may
never
!
*NL*
*NL*
Aunt
Sally
jumped
for
her
,
and
most
hugged
the
head
off
of
her
,
and
*NL*
cried
over
her
,
and
I
found
a
good
enough
place
for
me
under
the
bed
,
*NL*
for
it
was
getting
pretty
sultry
for
_
us
_
,
seemed
to
me
.
And
I
peeped
*NL*
out
,
and
in
a
little
while
Tom
's
Aunt
Polly
shook
herself
loose
and
*NL*
stood
there
looking
across
at
Tom
over
her
spectacles
--
kind
of
*NL*
grinding
him
into
the
earth
,
you
know
.
And
then
she
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
_
better
_
turn
y'
r
head
away
--
I
would
if
I
was
you
,
Tom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
deary
me
!
''
says
Aunt
Sally
;
''
_
is
_
he
changed
so
?
Why
,
that
ai
n't
*NL*
_
Tom
_
,
it
's
Sid
;
Tom
's
--
Tom
's
--
why
,
where
is
Tom
?
He
was
here
a
minute
*NL*
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
where
's
Huck
_
Finn
_
--
that
's
what
you
mean
!
I
reckon
I
hai
n't
*NL*
raised
such
a
scamp
as
my
Tom
all
these
years
not
to
know
him
when
I
*NL*
_
see
_
him
.
That
_
would
_
be
a
pretty
howdy-do
.
Come
out
from
under
that
*NL*
bed
,
Huck
Finn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
I
done
it
.
But
not
feeling
brash
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aunt
Sally
she
was
one
of
the
mixed-upest-looking
persons
I
ever
*NL*
see
--
except
one
,
and
that
was
Uncle
Silas
,
when
he
come
in
and
they
*NL*
told
it
all
to
him
.
It
kind
of
made
him
drunk
,
as
you
may
say
,
and
he
*NL*
did
n't
know
nothing
at
all
the
rest
of
the
day
,
and
preached
a
*NL*
prayer-meeting
sermon
that
night
that
gave
him
a
rattling
ruputation
,
*NL*
because
the
oldest
man
in
the
world
could
n't
`
a
'
understood
it
.
So
*NL*
Tom
's
Aunt
Polly
,
she
told
all
about
who
I
was
,
and
what
;
and
I
had
to
*NL*
up
and
tell
how
I
was
in
such
a
tight
place
that
when
Mrs.
Phelps
took
*NL*
me
for
Tom
Sawyer
--
she
chipped
in
and
says
,
``
Oh
,
go
on
and
call
me
*NL*
Aunt
Sally
,
I
'm
used
to
it
now
,
and
`
taint
no
need
to
change
''
--
that
*NL*
when
Aunt
Sally
took
me
for
Tom
Sawyer
I
had
to
stand
it
--
there
war
n't
*NL*
no
other
way
,
and
I
knowed
he
would
n't
mind
,
because
it
would
be
nuts
*NL*
for
him
,
being
a
mystery
,
and
he
'd
make
an
adventure
out
of
it
,
and
be
*NL*
perfectly
satisfied
.
And
so
it
turned
out
,
and
he
let
on
to
be
Sid
,
*NL*
and
made
things
as
soft
as
he
could
for
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
his
Aunt
Polly
she
said
Tom
was
right
about
old
Miss
Watson
*NL*
setting
Jim
free
in
her
will
;
and
so
,
sure
enough
,
Tom
Sawyer
had
gone
*NL*
and
took
all
that
trouble
and
bother
to
set
a
free
nigger
free
!
and
I
*NL*
could
n't
ever
understand
before
,
until
that
minute
and
that
talk
,
how
*NL*
he
_
could
_
help
a
body
set
a
nigger
free
with
his
bringing-up
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
Aunt
Polly
she
said
that
when
Aunt
Sally
wrote
to
her
that
Tom
*NL*
and
_
Sid
_
had
come
all
right
and
safe
,
she
says
to
herself
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
at
that
,
now
!
I
might
have
expected
it
,
letting
him
go
off
that
*NL*
way
without
anybody
to
watch
him
.
So
now
I
got
to
go
and
trapse
all
*NL*
the
way
down
the
river
,
eleven
hundred
mile
,
and
find
out
what
that
*NL*
creetur
's
up
to
_
this
_
time
,
as
long
as
I
could
n't
seem
to
get
any
*NL*
answer
out
of
you
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
never
heard
nothing
from
you
,
''
says
Aunt
Sally
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
wonder
!
Why
,
I
wrote
you
twice
to
ask
you
what
you
could
mean
*NL*
by
Sid
being
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
never
got
'em
.
Sis
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Aunt
Polly
she
turns
around
slow
and
severe
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
,
Tom
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
_
what
?
_
''
he
says
,
kind
of
pettish
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
what
_
me
_
,
you
impudent
thing
--
hand
out
them
letters

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
letters
?

*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Them

letters

I
be
bound

if
I
have
to
take
a-holt
of
you
I
'll

*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
in
the
trunk

There
,
now
.
And
they
're
just
the
same
as
they
*NL*
was
when
I
got
them
out
of
the
office
.
I
hai
n't
looked
into
them
,
I
*NL*
hai
n't
touched
them
.
But
I
knowed
they
'd
make
trouble
,
and
I
thought
*NL*
if
you
war
n't
in
no
hurry
,
I
'd
--

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
_
do
_
need
skinning
,
there
ai
n't
no
mistake
about
it

And
I
*NL*
wrote
another
one
to
tell
you
I
was
coming
;
and
I
s
`
pose
he
--

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

it
come
yesterday

I
hai
n't
read
it
yet

but
_
it
's
_
all
right
,
*NL*
I
've
got
that
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
wanted
to
offer
to
bet
two
dollars
she
had
n't
,
but
I
reckoned
maybe
*NL*
it
was
just
as
safe
to
not
to
.
So
I
never
said
nothing

CHAPTER
THE
LAST
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
time
I
catched
Tom
private
I
asked
him
what
was
his
idea
,
*NL*
time
of
the
evasion
?
--
what
it
was
he
'd
planned
to
do
if
the
evasion
*NL*
worked
all
right
and
he
managed
to
set
a
nigger
free
that
was
already
*NL*
free
before
?
And
he
said
,
what
he
had
planned
in
his
head
from
the
*NL*
start
,
if
we
got
Jim
out
all
safe
,
was
for
us
to
run
him
down
the
*NL*
river
on
the
raft
,
and
have
adventures
plumb
to
the
mouth
of
the
*NL*
river
,
and
then
tell
him
about
his
being
free
,
and
take
him
back
up
*NL*
home
on
a
steamboat
,
in
style
,
and
pay
him
for
his
lost
time
,
and
*NL*
write
word
ahead
and
get
out
all
the
niggers
around
,
and
have
them
*NL*
waltz
him
into
town
with
a
torchlight
procession
and
a
brass-band
,
and
*NL*
then
he
would
be
a
hero
,
and
so
would
we
.
But
I
reckoned
it
was
about
*NL*
as
well
the
way
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
Jim
out
of
the
chains
in
no
time
,
and
when
Aunt
Polly
and
Uncle
*NL*
Silas
and
Aunt
Sally
found
out
how
good
he
helped
the
doctor
nurse
*NL*
Tom
,
they
made
a
heap
of
fuss
over
him
,
and
fixed
him
up
prime
,
and
*NL*
give
him
all
he
wanted
to
eat
,
and
a
good
time
,
and
nothing
to
do
.
And
*NL*
we
had
him
up
to
the
sick-room
,
and
had
a
high
talk
;
and
Tom
give
Jim
*NL*
forty
dollars
for
being
prisoner
for
us
so
patient
,
and
doing
it
up
so
*NL*
good
,
and
Jim
was
pleased
most
to
death
and
busted
out
,
and
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Dah
_
,
now
,
Huck
,
what
I
tell
you
?
--
what
I
tell
you

?

,

en

Dah

_
--
signs

en
I

'
's

`

*NL*

`
in
as
I
's
a-stannin
'
heah
dis
minute
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
Tom
he
talked
along
and
talked
along
,
and
says
,
le
's
all
*NL*
three
slide
out
of
here
one
of
these
nights
and
get
an
outfit
,
and
go
*NL*
for
howling
adventures
amongst
the
Injuns
,
over
in
the
territory
,
for
*NL*
a
couple
of
weeks
or
two
;
and
I
says
,
all
right
,
that
suits
me
,
but
I
*NL*
ai
n't
got
no
money
for
to
buy
the
outfit
,
and
I
reckon
I
could
n't
get
*NL*
none
from
home
,
because
it
's
likely
pap
's
been
back
before
now
,
and
*NL*
got
it
all
away
from
Judge
Thatcher
and
drunk
it
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
he
hai
n't
,
''
Tom
says
;
``
it
's
all
there
yet
--
six
thousand
dollars
*NL*
and
more
;
and
your
pap
hai
n't
ever
been
back
since
.
Had
n't
when
I
come
*NL*
away
,
anyhow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jim
says
,
kind
of
solemn
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
ai
n't
a-comin
'
back
no
mo
'
,
Huck
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Jim
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nemmine
why
,
Huck
--
but
he
ai
n't
comin
'
back
no
mo
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
kept
at
him
;
so
at
last
he
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doan
'
you
`
member
de
house
dat
was
float
'n
down
de
river
,
en
dey
wuz
*NL*
a
man
in
dah
,
kivered
up
,
en
I
went
in
en
unkivered
him
and
didn
'
let
*NL*
you
come
in
?
Well
,
den
,
you
kin
git
yo
'
money
when
you
wants
it
,
kase
*NL*
dat
wuz
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
's
most
well
now
,
and
got
his
bullet
around
his
neck
on
a
*NL*
watch-guard
for
a
watch
,
and
is
always
seeing
what
time
it
is
,
and
so
*NL*
there
ai
n't
nothing
more
to
write
about
,
and
I
am
rotten
glad
of
it
,
*NL*
because
if
I
'd
`
a
'
knowed
what
a
trouble
it
was
to
make
a
book
I
*NL*
would
n't
`
a
'
tackled
it
,
and
ai
n't
a-going
to
no
more
.
But
I
reckon
I
*NL*
got
to
light
out
for
the
territory
ahead
of
the
rest
,
because
Aunt
*NL*
Sally
she
's
going
to
adopt
me
and
sivilize
me
,
and
I
ca
n't
stand
it
.
I
*NL*
been
there
before
