PREFACE
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
years
ago
,
while
visiting
or
,
rather
,
rummaging
about
Notre-Dame
,
*NL*
the
author
of
this
book
found
,
in
an
obscure
nook
of
one
of
the
towers
,
*NL*
the
following
word
,
engraved
by
hand
upon
the
wall
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
_
ANArKH
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
These
Greek
capitals
,
black
with
age
,
and
quite
deeply
graven
in
*NL*
the
stone
,
with
I
know
not
what
signs
peculiar
to
Gothic
caligraphy
*NL*
imprinted
upon
their
forms
and
upon
their
attitudes
,
as
though
with
the
*NL*
purpose
of
revealing
that
it
had
been
a
hand
of
the
Middle
Ages
which
*NL*
had
inscribed
them
there
,
and
especially
the
fatal
and
melancholy
*NL*
meaning
contained
in
them
,
struck
the
author
deeply
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
questioned
himself
;
he
sought
to
divine
who
could
have
been
that
soul
*NL*
in
torment
which
had
not
been
willing
to
quit
this
world
without
leaving
*NL*
this
stigma
of
crime
or
unhappiness
upon
the
brow
of
the
ancient
church
.
*NL*
*NL*
Afterwards
,
the
wall
was
whitewashed
or
scraped
down
,
I
know
not
which
,
*NL*
and
the
inscription
disappeared
.
For
it
is
thus
that
people
have
been
in
*NL*
the
habit
of
proceeding
with
the
marvellous
churches
of
the
Middle
Ages
*NL*
for
the
last
two
hundred
years
.
Mutilations
come
to
them
from
every
*NL*
quarter
,
from
within
as
well
as
from
without
.
The
priest
whitewashes
*NL*
them
,
the
archdeacon
scrapes
them
down
;
then
the
populace
arrives
and
*NL*
demolishes
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
,
with
the
exception
of
the
fragile
memory
which
the
author
of
this
*NL*
book
here
consecrates
to
it
,
there
remains
to-day
nothing
whatever
*NL*
of
the
mysterious
word
engraved
within
the
gloomy
tower
of
*NL*
Notre-Dame
,
--
nothing
of
the
destiny
which
it
so
sadly
summed
up
.
The
*NL*
man
who
wrote
that
word
upon
the
wall
disappeared
from
the
midst
of
the
*NL*
generations
of
man
many
centuries
ago
;
the
word
,
in
its
turn
,
has
been
*NL*
effaced
from
the
wall
of
the
church
;
the
church
will
,
perhaps
,
itself
*NL*
soon
disappear
from
the
face
of
the
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
upon
this
word
that
this
book
is
founded
.

THE
GRAND
HALL
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Three
hundred
and
forty-eight
years
,
six
months
,
and
nineteen
days
ago
*NL*
to-day
,
the
Parisians
awoke
to
the
sound
of
all
the
bells
in
the
triple
*NL*
circuit
of
the
city
,
the
university
,
and
the
town
ringing
a
full
peal
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sixth
of
January
,
1482
,
is
not
,
however
,
a
day
of
which
history
has
*NL*
preserved
the
memory
.
There
was
nothing
notable
in
the
event
which
*NL*
thus
set
the
bells
and
the
bourgeois
of
Paris
in
a
ferment
from
early
*NL*
morning
.
It
was
neither
an
assault
by
the
Picards
nor
the
Burgundians
,
*NL*
nor
a
hunt
led
along
in
procession
,
nor
a
revolt
of
scholars
in
the
town
*NL*
of
Laas
,
nor
an
entry
of
``
our
much
dread
lord
,
monsieur
the
king
,
''
nor
*NL*
even
a
pretty
hanging
of
male
and
female
thieves
by
the
courts
of
Paris
.
*NL*
Neither
was
it
the
arrival
,
so
frequent
in
the
fifteenth
century
,
of
*NL*
some
plumed
and
bedizened
embassy
.
It
was
barely
two
days
since
the
last
*NL*
cavalcade
of
that
nature
,
that
of
the
Flemish
ambassadors
charged
with
*NL*
concluding
the
marriage
between
the
dauphin
and
Marguerite
of
Flanders
,
*NL*
had
made
its
entry
into
Paris
,
to
the
great
annoyance
of
M.
le
Cardinal
*NL*
de
Bourbon
,
who
,
for
the
sake
of
pleasing
the
king
,
had
been
obliged
*NL*
to
assume
an
amiable
mien
towards
this
whole
rustic
rabble
of
Flemish
*NL*
burgomasters
,
and
to
regale
them
at
his
Hotel
de
Bourbon
,
with
a
very
*NL*
``
pretty
morality
,
allegorical
satire
,
and
farce
,
''
while
a
driving
rain
*NL*
drenched
the
magnificent
tapestries
at
his
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
put
the
``
whole
population
of
Paris
in
commotion
,
''
as
Jehan
de
*NL*
Troyes
expresses
it
,
on
the
sixth
of
January
,
was
the
double
solemnity
,
*NL*
united
from
time
immemorial
,
of
the
Epiphany
and
the
Feast
of
Fools
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
that
day
,
there
was
to
be
a
bonfire
on
the
Place
de
Greve
,
a
maypole
*NL*
at
the
Chapelle
de
Braque
,
and
a
mystery
at
the
Palais
de
Justice
.
It
*NL*
had
been
cried
,
to
the
sound
of
the
trumpet
,
the
preceding
evening
at
*NL*
all
the
cross
roads
,
by
the
provost
's
men
,
clad
in
handsome
,
short
,
*NL*
sleeveless
coats
of
violet
camelot
,
with
large
white
crosses
upon
their
*NL*
breasts
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
crowd
of
citizens
,
male
and
female
,
having
closed
their
houses
*NL*
and
shops
,
thronged
from
every
direction
,
at
early
morn
,
towards
some
*NL*
one
of
the
three
spots
designated
.
*NL*
*NL*
Each
had
made
his
choice
;
one
,
the
bonfire
;
another
,
the
maypole
;
*NL*
another
,
the
mystery
play
.
It
must
be
stated
,
in
honor
of
the
good
sense
*NL*
of
the
loungers
of
Paris
,
that
the
greater
part
of
this
crowd
directed
*NL*
their
steps
towards
the
bonfire
,
which
was
quite
in
season
,
or
towards
*NL*
the
mystery
play
,
which
was
to
be
presented
in
the
grand
hall
of
the
*NL*
Palais
de
Justice
-LRB-
the
courts
of
law
-RRB-
,
which
was
well
roofed
and
walled
;
*NL*
and
that
the
curious
left
the
poor
,
scantily
flowered
maypole
to
shiver
*NL*
all
alone
beneath
the
sky
of
January
,
in
the
cemetery
of
the
Chapel
of
*NL*
Braque
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
populace
thronged
the
avenues
of
the
law
courts
in
particular
,
*NL*
because
they
knew
that
the
Flemish
ambassadors
,
who
had
arrived
two
days
*NL*
previously
,
intended
to
be
present
at
the
representation
of
the
mystery
,
*NL*
and
at
the
election
of
the
Pope
of
the
Fools
,
which
was
also
to
take
*NL*
place
in
the
grand
hall
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
no
easy
matter
on
that
day
,
to
force
one
's
way
into
that
grand
*NL*
hall
,
although
it
was
then
reputed
to
be
the
largest
covered
enclosure
*NL*
in
the
world
-LRB-
it
is
true
that
Sauval
had
not
yet
measured
the
grand
hall
*NL*
of
the
Chateau
of
Montargis
-RRB-
.
The
palace
place
,
encumbered
with
people
,
*NL*
offered
to
the
curious
gazers
at
the
windows
the
aspect
of
a
sea
;
into
*NL*
which
five
or
six
streets
,
like
so
many
mouths
of
rivers
,
discharged
*NL*
every
moment
fresh
floods
of
heads
.
The
waves
of
this
crowd
,
augmented
*NL*
incessantly
,
dashed
against
the
angles
of
the
houses
which
projected
*NL*
here
and
there
,
like
so
many
promontories
,
into
the
irregular
basin
of
*NL*
the
place
.
In
the
centre
of
the
lofty
Gothic
*
facade
of
the
palace
,
the
*NL*
grand
staircase
,
incessantly
ascended
and
descended
by
a
double
current
,
*NL*
which
,
after
parting
on
the
intermediate
landing-place
,
flowed
in
broad
*NL*
waves
along
its
lateral
slopes
,
--
the
grand
staircase
,
I
say
,
trickled
*NL*
incessantly
into
the
place
,
like
a
cascade
into
a
lake
.
The
cries
,
the
*NL*
laughter
,
the
trampling
of
those
thousands
of
feet
,
produced
a
great
*NL*
noise
and
a
great
clamor
.
From
time
to
time
,
this
noise
and
clamor
*NL*
redoubled
;
the
current
which
drove
the
crowd
towards
the
grand
staircase
*NL*
flowed
backwards
,
became
troubled
,
formed
whirlpools
.
This
was
produced
*NL*
by
the
buffet
of
an
archer
,
or
the
horse
of
one
of
the
provost
's
*NL*
sergeants
,
which
kicked
to
restore
order
;
an
admirable
tradition
which
*NL*
the
provostship
has
bequeathed
to
the
constablery
,
the
constablery
to
*NL*
the
_
marechaussee
_
,
the
_
marechaussee
_
to
our
_
gendarmeri
_
of
Paris
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
The
word
Gothic
,
in
the
sense
in
which
it
is
generally
employed
,
*NL*
is
wholly
unsuitable
,
but
wholly
consecrated
.
Hence
we
accept
it
and
*NL*
we
adopt
it
,
like
all
the
rest
of
the
world
,
to
characterize
the
*NL*
architecture
of
the
second
half
of
the
Middle
Ages
,
where
the
ogive
is
*NL*
the
principle
which
succeeds
the
architecture
of
the
first
period
,
of
*NL*
which
the
semi-circle
is
the
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Thousands
of
good
,
calm
,
bourgeois
faces
thronged
the
windows
,
the
*NL*
doors
,
the
dormer
windows
,
the
roofs
,
gazing
at
the
palace
,
gazing
*NL*
at
the
populace
,
and
asking
nothing
more
;
for
many
Parisians
content
*NL*
themselves
with
the
spectacle
of
the
spectators
,
and
a
wall
behind
which
*NL*
something
is
going
on
becomes
at
once
,
for
us
,
a
very
curious
thing
*NL*
indeed
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
it
could
be
granted
to
us
,
the
men
of
1830
,
to
mingle
in
thought
*NL*
with
those
Parisians
of
the
fifteenth
century
,
and
to
enter
with
them
,
*NL*
jostled
,
elbowed
,
pulled
about
,
into
that
immense
hall
of
the
palace
,
*NL*
which
was
so
cramped
on
that
sixth
of
January
,
1482
,
the
spectacle
would
*NL*
not
be
devoid
of
either
interest
or
charm
,
and
we
should
have
about
us
*NL*
only
things
that
were
so
old
that
they
would
seem
new
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
reader
's
consent
,
we
will
endeavor
to
retrace
in
thought
,
*NL*
the
impression
which
he
would
have
experienced
in
company
with
us
*NL*
on
crossing
the
threshold
of
that
grand
hall
,
in
the
midst
of
that
*NL*
tumultuous
crowd
in
surcoats
,
short
,
sleeveless
jackets
,
and
doublets
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
first
of
all
,
there
is
a
buzzing
in
the
ears
,
a
dazzlement
in
*NL*
the
eyes
.
Above
our
heads
is
a
double
ogive
vault
,
panelled
with
wood
*NL*
carving
,
painted
azure
,
and
sown
with
golden
fleurs-de-lis
;
beneath
*NL*
our
feet
a
pavement
of
black
and
white
marble
,
alternating
.
A
few
paces
*NL*
distant
,
an
enormous
pillar
,
then
another
,
then
another
;
seven
pillars
*NL*
in
all
,
down
the
length
of
the
hall
,
sustaining
the
spring
of
the
arches
*NL*
of
the
double
vault
,
in
the
centre
of
its
width
.
Around
four
of
the
*NL*
pillars
,
stalls
of
merchants
,
all
sparkling
with
glass
and
tinsel
;
*NL*
around
the
last
three
,
benches
of
oak
,
worn
and
polished
by
the
trunk
*NL*
hose
of
the
litigants
,
and
the
robes
of
the
attorneys
.
Around
the
hall
,
*NL*
along
the
lofty
wall
,
between
the
doors
,
between
the
windows
,
between
*NL*
the
pillars
,
the
interminable
row
of
all
the
kings
of
France
,
from
*NL*
Pharamond
down
:
the
lazy
kings
,
with
pendent
arms
and
downcast
eyes
;
*NL*
the
valiant
and
combative
kings
,
with
heads
and
arms
raised
boldly
*NL*
heavenward
.
Then
in
the
long
,
pointed
windows
,
glass
of
a
thousand
hues
;
*NL*
at
the
wide
entrances
to
the
hall
,
rich
doors
,
finely
sculptured
;
and
*NL*
all
,
the
vaults
,
pillars
,
walls
,
jambs
,
panelling
,
doors
,
statues
,
*NL*
covered
from
top
to
bottom
with
a
splendid
blue
and
gold
illumination
,
*NL*
which
,
a
trifle
tarnished
at
the
epoch
when
we
behold
it
,
had
almost
*NL*
entirely
disappeared
beneath
dust
and
spiders
in
the
year
of
grace
,
*NL*
1549
,
when
du
Breul
still
admired
it
from
tradition
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
the
reader
picture
to
himself
now
,
this
immense
,
oblong
hall
,
*NL*
illuminated
by
the
pallid
light
of
a
January
day
,
invaded
by
a
motley
*NL*
and
noisy
throng
which
drifts
along
the
walls
,
and
eddies
round
the
*NL*
seven
pillars
,
and
he
will
have
a
confused
idea
of
the
whole
effect
of
*NL*
the
picture
,
whose
curious
details
we
shall
make
an
effort
to
indicate
*NL*
with
more
precision
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
certain
,
that
if
Ravaillac
had
not
assassinated
Henri
IV.
,
there
*NL*
would
have
been
no
documents
in
the
trial
of
Ravaillac
deposited
in
the
*NL*
clerk
's
office
of
the
Palais
de
Justice
,
no
accomplices
interested
in
*NL*
causing
the
said
documents
to
disappear
;
hence
,
no
incendiaries
obliged
,
*NL*
for
lack
of
better
means
,
to
burn
the
clerk
's
office
in
order
to
burn
*NL*
the
documents
,
and
to
burn
the
Palais
de
Justice
in
order
to
burn
the
*NL*
clerk
's
office
;
consequently
,
in
short
,
no
conflagration
in
1618
.
The
*NL*
old
Palais
would
be
standing
still
,
with
its
ancient
grand
hall
;
I
*NL*
should
be
able
to
say
to
the
reader
,
``
Go
and
look
at
it
,
''
and
we
should
*NL*
thus
both
escape
the
necessity
,
--
I
of
making
,
and
he
of
reading
,
a
*NL*
description
of
it
,
such
as
it
is
.
Which
demonstrates
a
new
truth
:
that
*NL*
great
events
have
incalculable
results
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
true
that
it
may
be
quite
possible
,
in
the
first
place
,
that
*NL*
Ravaillac
had
no
accomplices
;
and
in
the
second
,
that
if
he
had
any
,
*NL*
they
were
in
no
way
connected
with
the
fire
of
1618
.
Two
other
very
*NL*
plausible
explanations
exist
:
First
,
the
great
flaming
star
,
a
foot
*NL*
broad
,
and
a
cubit
high
,
which
fell
from
heaven
,
as
every
one
knows
,
*NL*
upon
the
law
courts
,
after
midnight
on
the
seventh
of
March
;
second
,
*NL*
Theophile
's
quatrain
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure
,
't
was
but
a
sorry
game
*NL*
When
at
Paris
,
Dame
Justice
,
*NL*
Through
having
eaten
too
much
spice
,
*NL*
Set
the
palace
all
aflame
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Whatever
may
be
thought
of
this
triple
explanation
,
political
,
physical
,
*NL*
and
poetical
,
of
the
burning
of
the
law
courts
in
1618
,
the
unfortunate
*NL*
fact
of
the
fire
is
certain
.
Very
little
to-day
remains
,
thanks
to
this
*NL*
catastrophe
,
--
thanks
,
above
all
,
to
the
successive
restorations
which
*NL*
have
completed
what
it
spared
,
--
very
little
remains
of
that
first
*NL*
dwelling
of
the
kings
of
France
,
--
of
that
elder
palace
of
the
Louvre
,
*NL*
already
so
old
in
the
time
of
Philip
the
Handsome
,
that
they
sought
*NL*
there
for
the
traces
of
the
magnificent
buildings
erected
by
King
Robert
*NL*
and
described
by
Helgaldus
.
Nearly
everything
has
disappeared
.
What
has
*NL*
become
of
the
chamber
of
the
chancellery
,
where
Saint
Louis
consummated
*NL*
his
marriage
?
the
garden
where
he
administered
justice
,
``
clad
in
a
*NL*
coat
of
camelot
,
a
surcoat
of
linsey-woolsey
,
without
sleeves
,
and
a
*NL*
sur-mantle
of
black
sandal
,
as
he
lay
upon
the
carpet
with
Joinville
?
''
*NL*
Where
is
the
chamber
of
the
Emperor
Sigismond
?
and
that
of
Charles
IV
.
?
*NL*
that
of
Jean
the
Landless
?
Where
is
the
staircase
,
from
which
Charles
*NL*
VI
.
promulgated
his
edict
of
pardon
?
the
slab
where
Marcel
cut
the
*NL*
throats
of
Robert
de
Clermont
and
the
Marshal
of
Champagne
,
in
the
*NL*
presence
of
the
dauphin
?
the
wicket
where
the
bulls
of
Pope
Benedict
*NL*
were
torn
,
and
whence
those
who
had
brought
them
departed
decked
out
,
in
*NL*
derision
,
in
copes
and
mitres
,
and
making
an
apology
through
all
Paris
?
*NL*
and
the
grand
hall
,
with
its
gilding
,
its
azure
,
its
statues
,
its
*NL*
pointed
arches
,
its
pillars
,
its
immense
vault
,
all
fretted
with
*NL*
carvings
?
and
the
gilded
chamber
?
and
the
stone
lion
,
which
stood
at
the
*NL*
door
,
with
lowered
head
and
tail
between
his
legs
,
like
the
lions
on
the
*NL*
throne
of
Solomon
,
in
the
humiliated
attitude
which
befits
force
in
the
*NL*
presence
of
justice
?
and
the
beautiful
doors
?
and
the
stained
glass
?
*NL*
and
the
chased
ironwork
,
which
drove
Biscornette
to
despair
?
and
the
*NL*
delicate
woodwork
of
Hancy
?
What
has
time
,
what
have
men
done
with
these
*NL*
marvels
?
What
have
they
given
us
in
return
for
all
this
Gallic
history
,
*NL*
for
all
this
Gothic
art
?
The
heavy
flattened
arches
of
M.
de
Brosse
,
*NL*
that
awkward
architect
of
the
Saint-Gervais
portal
.
So
much
for
art
;
*NL*
and
,
as
for
history
,
we
have
the
gossiping
reminiscences
of
the
great
*NL*
pillar
,
still
ringing
with
the
tattle
of
the
Patru
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
not
much
.
Let
us
return
to
the
veritable
grand
hall
of
the
*NL*
veritable
old
palace
.
The
two
extremities
of
this
gigantic
parallelogram
*NL*
were
occupied
,
the
one
by
the
famous
marble
table
,
so
long
,
so
broad
,
*NL*
and
so
thick
that
,
as
the
ancient
land
rolls
--
in
a
style
that
would
have
*NL*
given
Gargantua
an
appetite
--
say
,
``
such
a
slice
of
marble
as
was
never
*NL*
beheld
in
the
world
''
;
the
other
by
the
chapel
where
Louis
XI
.
had
*NL*
himself
sculptured
on
his
knees
before
the
Virgin
,
and
whither
he
caused
*NL*
to
be
brought
,
without
heeding
the
two
gaps
thus
made
in
the
row
of
*NL*
royal
statues
,
the
statues
of
Charlemagne
and
of
Saint
Louis
,
two
saints
*NL*
whom
he
supposed
to
be
great
in
favor
in
heaven
,
as
kings
of
France
.
*NL*
This
chapel
,
quite
new
,
having
been
built
only
six
years
,
was
entirely
*NL*
in
that
charming
taste
of
delicate
architecture
,
of
marvellous
*NL*
sculpture
,
of
fine
and
deep
chasing
,
which
marks
with
us
the
end
of
*NL*
the
Gothic
era
,
and
which
is
perpetuated
to
about
the
middle
of
the
*NL*
sixteenth
century
in
the
fairylike
fancies
of
the
Renaissance
.
The
*NL*
little
open-work
rose
window
,
pierced
above
the
portal
,
was
,
in
*NL*
particular
,
a
masterpiece
of
lightness
and
grace
;
one
would
have
*NL*
pronounced
it
a
star
of
lace
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
middle
of
the
hall
,
opposite
the
great
door
,
a
platform
of
gold
*NL*
brocade
,
placed
against
the
wall
,
a
special
entrance
to
which
had
been
*NL*
effected
through
a
window
in
the
corridor
of
the
gold
chamber
,
had
*NL*
been
erected
for
the
Flemish
emissaries
and
the
other
great
personages
*NL*
invited
to
the
presentation
of
the
mystery
play
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
upon
the
marble
table
that
the
mystery
was
to
be
enacted
,
as
*NL*
usual
.
It
had
been
arranged
for
the
purpose
,
early
in
the
morning
;
*NL*
its
rich
slabs
of
marble
,
all
scratched
by
the
heels
of
law
clerks
,
*NL*
supported
a
cage
of
carpenter
's
work
of
considerable
height
,
the
upper
*NL*
surface
of
which
,
within
view
of
the
whole
hall
,
was
to
serve
as
the
*NL*
theatre
,
and
whose
interior
,
masked
by
tapestries
,
was
to
take
the
place
*NL*
of
dressing-rooms
for
the
personages
of
the
piece
.
A
ladder
,
naively
*NL*
placed
on
the
outside
,
was
to
serve
as
means
of
communication
between
*NL*
the
dressing-room
and
the
stage
,
and
lend
its
rude
rungs
to
entrances
as
*NL*
well
as
to
exits
.
There
was
no
personage
,
however
unexpected
,
no
sudden
*NL*
change
,
no
theatrical
effect
,
which
was
not
obliged
to
mount
that
*NL*
ladder
.
Innocent
and
venerable
infancy
of
art
and
contrivances
!
*NL*
*NL*
Four
of
the
bailiff
of
the
palace
's
sergeants
,
perfunctory
guardians
of
*NL*
all
the
pleasures
of
the
people
,
on
days
of
festival
as
well
as
on
days
*NL*
of
execution
,
stood
at
the
four
corners
of
the
marble
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
piece
was
only
to
begin
with
the
twelfth
stroke
of
the
great
palace
*NL*
clock
sounding
midday
.
It
was
very
late
,
no
doubt
,
for
a
theatrical
*NL*
representation
,
but
they
had
been
obliged
to
fix
the
hour
to
suit
the
*NL*
convenience
of
the
ambassadors
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
this
whole
multitude
had
been
waiting
since
morning
.
A
goodly
*NL*
number
of
curious
,
good
people
had
been
shivering
since
daybreak
before
*NL*
the
grand
staircase
of
the
palace
;
some
even
affirmed
that
they
had
*NL*
passed
the
night
across
the
threshold
of
the
great
door
,
in
order
to
*NL*
make
sure
that
they
should
be
the
first
to
pass
in
.
The
crowd
grew
more
*NL*
dense
every
moment
,
and
,
like
water
,
which
rises
above
its
normal
level
,
*NL*
began
to
mount
along
the
walls
,
to
swell
around
the
pillars
,
to
spread
*NL*
out
on
the
entablatures
,
on
the
cornices
,
on
the
window-sills
,
on
*NL*
all
the
salient
points
of
the
architecture
,
on
all
the
reliefs
of
the
*NL*
sculpture
.
Hence
,
discomfort
,
impatience
,
weariness
,
the
liberty
of
a
*NL*
day
of
cynicism
and
folly
,
the
quarrels
which
break
forth
for
all
sorts
*NL*
of
causes
--
a
pointed
elbow
,
an
iron-shod
shoe
,
the
fatigue
of
long
*NL*
waiting
--
had
already
,
long
before
the
hour
appointed
for
the
arrival
*NL*
of
the
ambassadors
,
imparted
a
harsh
and
bitter
accent
to
the
clamor
of
*NL*
these
people
who
were
shut
in
,
fitted
into
each
other
,
pressed
,
trampled
*NL*
upon
,
stifled
.
Nothing
was
to
be
heard
but
imprecations
on
the
Flemish
,
*NL*
the
provost
of
the
merchants
,
the
Cardinal
de
Bourbon
,
the
bailiff
of
*NL*
the
courts
,
Madame
Marguerite
of
Austria
,
the
sergeants
with
their
rods
,
*NL*
the
cold
,
the
heat
,
the
bad
weather
,
the
Bishop
of
Paris
,
the
Pope
of
*NL*
the
Fools
,
the
pillars
,
the
statues
,
that
closed
door
,
that
open
window
;
*NL*
all
to
the
vast
amusement
of
a
band
of
scholars
and
lackeys
scattered
*NL*
through
the
mass
,
who
mingled
with
all
this
discontent
their
teasing
*NL*
remarks
,
and
their
malicious
suggestions
,
and
pricked
the
general
bad
*NL*
temper
with
a
pin
,
so
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
the
rest
there
was
a
group
of
those
merry
imps
,
who
,
after
*NL*
smashing
the
glass
in
a
window
,
had
seated
themselves
hardily
on
*NL*
the
entablature
,
and
from
that
point
despatched
their
gaze
and
their
*NL*
railleries
both
within
and
without
,
upon
the
throng
in
the
hall
,
and
the
*NL*
throng
upon
the
Place
.
It
was
easy
to
see
,
from
their
parodied
gestures
,
*NL*
their
ringing
laughter
,
the
bantering
appeals
which
they
exchanged
with
*NL*
their
comrades
,
from
one
end
of
the
hall
to
the
other
,
that
these
*NL*
young
clerks
did
not
share
the
weariness
and
fatigue
of
the
rest
of
the
*NL*
spectators
,
and
that
they
understood
very
well
the
art
of
extracting
,
*NL*
for
their
own
private
diversion
from
that
which
they
had
under
their
*NL*
eyes
,
a
spectacle
which
made
them
await
the
other
with
patience
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
soul
,
so
it
's
you
,
`
Joannes
Frollo
de
Molendino
!

''
cried
one
*NL*
of
them
,
to
a
sort
of
little
,
light-haired
imp
,
with
a
well-favored
and
*NL*
malign
countenance
,
clinging
to
the
acanthus
leaves
of
a
capital
;
``
you
*NL*
are
well

the
Mill

the

long
have
you
*NL*
been
here

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
mercy

''
retorted
Joannes
Frollo
,
``
these
four
*NL*
hours
and
more
;
and
I
hope
that
they
will
be
reckoned
to
my

purgatory
.
I
heard
the
eight
singers
of
the
King
of
Sicily
intone
the
*NL*
first
verse
of
seven
o'clock
mass
in
the
Sainte-Chapelle

*NL*
*NL*
``

replied
the

``

an
old
woman
sharply
from
among
the
crowd
beneath
the
*NL*
window

a

stopping
up
his

towards
the

the
little
student

clinging
to

A
shout
of
laughter
from
all
the
students
greeted
the
unlucky
name

the
poor
furrier

the
king
's

one
voice

The

held
their
peace

Then
a
great
hurly-burly
ensued

a
vast
*NL*
movement
of
feet
,
hands
,
and
heads
;
a
general
outbreak
of
coughs
and
*NL*
handkerchiefs
;
each
one
arranged
himself
,
assumed
his
post
,
raised
*NL*
himself
up
,
and
grouped
himself

Then
came
a
great
silence

all
necks
*NL*
remained
outstretched
,
all
mouths
remained
open
,
all
glances
were
*NL*
directed
towards
the
marble
table

Nothing
made
its
appearance
there

*NL*
The
bailiff
's
four
sergeants
were
still
there
,
stiff
,
motionless
,
as
*NL*
painted
statues
.
All
eyes
turned
to
the
estrade
reserved
for
the
Flemish
*NL*
envoys
.
The
door
remained
closed
,
the
platform
empty
.
This
crowd
had
*NL*
been
waiting
since
daybreak
for
three
things
:
noonday
,
the
embassy
from
*NL*
Flanders
,
the
mystery
play
.
Noonday
alone
had
arrived
on
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
this
occasion

it
was
too
much

*NL*
*NL*
They
waited
one
,
two
,
three
,
five
minutes
,
a
quarter
of
an
hour
;
nothing
*NL*
came
.
The
dais
remained
empty
,
the
theatre
dumb
.
In
the
meantime
,
wrath
*NL*
had
succeeded
to
impatience
.
Irritated
words
circulated
in
a
low
tone
,
*NL*
still
,
it
is
true
.
``
The
mystery
!
the
mystery
!
''
they
murmured
,
in
hollow
*NL*
voices
.
Heads
began
to
ferment
.
A
tempest
,
which
was
only
rumbling
in
*NL*
the
distance
as
yet
,
was
floating
on
the
surface
of
this
crowd
.
It
was
*NL*
Jehan

who
struck
the
first
spark
from
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
mystery

Flemings

he
exclaimed
at
the
*NL*
full
force
of
his
lungs
,
twining
like
a
serpent
around
his
pillar
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
crowd
clapped
their
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

it
repeated
,

may
all
the
devils
take
Flanders

*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
have
the
mystery
instantly

resumed
the
student
;
``
or
else

*NL*
my
advice
is
that
we

hang
the

a

comedy

A
grand
acclamation
followed
.
The
four
poor
fellows
began
to
turn
pale
,
*NL*
and
to
exchange
glances
.
The
crowd
hurled
itself
towards
them
,
and
they
*NL*
already
beheld
the
frail
wooden
railing
,
which
separated
them
from
it
,
*NL*
giving
way
and
bending
before
the
pressure
of
the
throng

*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
critical
moment

*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
sack

to
the
sack

rose
the
cry
on
all
sides

*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
,
the
tapestry
of
the
dressing-room
,
which
we
have
*NL*
described
above
,
was
raised
,
and
afforded
passage
to
a
personage
,
the
*NL*
mere
sight
of
whom
suddenly
stopped
the
crowd
,
and
changed
its
wrath
*NL*
into
curiosity
as
by
enchantment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Silence

silence

*NL*
The
personage
,
but
little
reassured
,
and
trembling
in
every
limb
,
*NL*
advanced
to
the
edge
of
the
marble
table
with
a
vast
amount
of
bows
,
*NL*
which
,
in
proportion
as
he
drew
nearer
,
more
and
more
resembled
*NL*
genuflections
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meanwhile
,
tranquillity
had
gradually
been
restored
.
All
that
*NL*
remained
was
that
slight
murmur
which
always
rises
above
the
silence
of
*NL*
a
crowd
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Messieurs
the
bourgeois
,
''
said
he
,
``
and
mesdemoiselles
the
*NL*
_
bourgeoises
_
,
we
shall
have
the
honor
of
declaiming
and
representing
,
*NL*
before
his
eminence
,
monsieur
the
cardinal
,
a
very
beautiful
morality
*NL*
which
has
for
its
title
,
`
The
Good
Judgment
of
Madame
the
Virgin
Mary
.
'
*NL*
I
am
to
play
Jupiter
.
His
eminence
is
,
at
this
moment
,
escorting
the
*NL*
very
honorable
embassy
of
the
Duke
of
Austria
;
which
is
detained
,
*NL*
at
present
,
listening
to
the
harangue
of
monsieur
the
rector
of
the
*NL*
university
,
at
the
gate
Baudets
.
As
soon
as
his
illustrious
eminence
,
*NL*
the
cardinal
,
arrives
,
we
will
begin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
certain
,
that
nothing
less
than
the
intervention
of
Jupiter
was
*NL*
required
to
save
the
four
unfortunate
sergeants
of
the
bailiff
of
the
*NL*
courts
.
If
we
had
the
happiness
of
having
invented
this
very
veracious
*NL*
tale
,
and
of
being
,
in
consequence
,
responsible
for
it
before
our
Lady
*NL*
Criticism
,
it
is
not
against
us
that
the
classic
precept
,
_
Nec
deus
*NL*
intersit
_
,
could
be
invoked
.
Moreover
,
the
costume
of
Seigneur
Jupiter
,
*NL*
was
very
handsome
,
and
contributed
not
a
little
towards
calming
the
*NL*
crowd
,
by
attracting
all
its
attention
.
Jupiter
was
clad
in
a
coat
of
*NL*
mail
,
covered
with
black
velvet
,
with
gilt
nails
;
and
had
it
not
been
*NL*
for
the
rouge
,
and
the
huge
red
beard
,
each
of
which
covered
one-half
of
*NL*
his
face
,
--
had
it
not
been
for
the
roll
of
gilded
cardboard
,
spangled
,
*NL*
and
all
bristling
with
strips
of
tinsel
,
which
he
held
in
his
hand
,
and
*NL*
in
which
the
eyes
of
the
initiated
easily
recognized
thunderbolts
,
--
had
*NL*
not
his
feet
been
flesh-colored
,
and
banded
with
ribbons
in
Greek
*NL*
fashion
,
he
might
have
borne
comparison
,
so
far
as
the
severity
of
his
*NL*
mien
was
concerned
,
with
a
Breton
archer
from
the
guard
of
Monsieur
de
*NL*
Berry
.

Nevertheless
,
as
be
harangued
them
,
the
satisfaction
and
admiration
*NL*
unanimously
excited
by
his
costume
were
dissipated
by
his
words
;
and
*NL*
when
he
reached
that
untoward
conclusion
:
``
As
soon
as
his
illustrious
*NL*
eminence
,
the
cardinal
,
arrives
,
we
will
begin
,
''
his
voice
was
drowned
*NL*
in
a
thunder
of
hooting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Begin
instantly
!
The
mystery
!
the
mystery
immediately
!
''
shrieked
the
*NL*
people
.
And
above
all
the
voices
,
that
of
Johannes
de
Molendino
*NL*
was
audible
,
piercing
the
uproar
like
the
fife
's
derisive
serenade
:
*NL*
``
Commence
instantly
!
''
yelped
the
scholar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Down
with
Jupiter
and
the
Cardinal
de
Bourbon
!
''
vociferated
Robin
*NL*
Poussepain
and
the
other
clerks
perched
in
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
morality
this
very
instant
!
''
repeated
the
crowd
;
``
this
very
*NL*
instant
!
the
sack
and
the
rope
for
the
comedians
,
and
the
cardinal
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Jupiter
,
haggard
,
frightened
,
pale
beneath
his
rouge
,
dropped
his
*NL*
thunderbolt
,
took
his
cap
in
his
hand
;
then
he
bowed
and
trembled
*NL*
and
stammered
:
``
His
eminence
--
the
ambassadors
--
Madame
Marguerite
of
*NL*
Flanders
--
.
''
He
did
not
know
what
to
say
.
In
truth
,
he
was
afraid
of
*NL*
being
hung
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hung
by
the
populace
for
waiting
,
hung
by
the
cardinal
for
not
having
*NL*
waited
,
he
saw
between
the
two
dilemmas
only
an
abyss
;
that
is
to
say
,
a
*NL*
gallows
.
*NL*
*NL*
Luckily
,
some
one
came
to
rescue
him
from
his
embarrassment
,
and
assume
*NL*
the
responsibility
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
individual
who
was
standing
beyond
the
railing
,
in
the
free
space
*NL*
around
the
marble
table
,
and
whom
no
one
had
yet
caught
sight
of
,
since
*NL*
his
long
,
thin
body
was
completely
sheltered
from
every
visual
ray
*NL*
by
the
diameter
of
the
pillar
against
which
he
was
leaning
;
this
*NL*
individual
,
we
say
,
tall
,
gaunt
,
pallid
,
blond
,
still
young
,
although
*NL*
already
wrinkled
about
the
brow
and
cheeks
,
with
brilliant
eyes
and
a
*NL*
smiling
mouth
,
clad
in
garments
of
black
serge
,
worn
and
shining
with
*NL*
age
,
approached
the
marble
table
,
and
made
a
sign
to
the
poor
sufferer
.
*NL*
But
the
other
was
so
confused
that
he
did
not
see
him
.
The
new
comer
*NL*
advanced
another
step
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jupiter
,
''
said
he
,
``
my
dear
Jupiter
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
did
not
hear
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
the
tall
blond
,
driven
out
of
patience
,
shrieked
almost
in
his
*NL*
face
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Michel
Giborne
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
calls
me
?
''
said
Jupiter
,
as
though
awakened
with
a
start
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
,
''
replied
the
person
clad
in
black
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
Jupiter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Begin
at
once
,
''
went
on
the
other
.
``
Satisfy
the
populace
;
I
undertake
*NL*
to
appease
the
bailiff
,
who
will
appease
monsieur
the
cardinal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jupiter
breathed
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Messeigneurs
the
bourgeois
,
''
he
cried
,
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
to
the
*NL*
crowd
,
which
continued
to
hoot
him
,
``
we
are
going
to
begin
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Evoe

Plaudite

All
hail

*NL*
shouted
the
scholars
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Noel
!
Noel
!
good
,
good
,
''
shouted
the
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hand
clapping
was
deafening
,
and
Jupiter
had
already
withdrawn
under
*NL*
his
tapestry
,
while
the
hall
still
trembled
with
acclamations
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meanwhile
,
the
personage
who
had
so
magically
turned
the
tempest
*NL*
into
dead
calm
,
as
our
old
and
dear
Corneille
puts
it
,
had
modestly
*NL*
retreated
to
the
half-shadow
of
his
pillar
,
and
would
,
no
doubt
,
have
*NL*
remained
invisible
there
,
motionless
,
and
mute
as
before
,
had
he
not
*NL*
been
plucked
by
the
sleeve
by
two
young
women
,
who
,
standing
in
the
*NL*
front
row
of
the
spectators
,
had
noticed
his
colloquy
with
Michel
*NL*
Giborne-Jupiter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Master
,
''
said
one
of
them
,
making
him
a
sign
to
approach
.
``
Hold
your
*NL*
tongue
,
my
dear
Lienarde
,
''
said
her
neighbor
,
pretty
,
fresh
,
and
very
*NL*
brave
,
in
consequence
of
being
dressed
up
in
her
best
attire
.
``
He
is
not
*NL*
a
clerk
,
he
is
a
layman
;
you
must
not
say
master
to
him
,
but
messire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Messire
,
''
said
Lienarde
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
stranger
approached
the
railing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
would
you
have
of
me
,
damsels
?
''
he
asked
,
with
alacrity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
nothing
,
''
replied
Lienarde
,
in
great
confusion
;
``
it
is
my
neighbor
,
*NL*
Gisquette
la
Gencienne
,
who
wishes
to
speak
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
so
,
''
replied
Gisquette
,
blushing
;
``
it
was
Lienarde
who
called
you
*NL*
master
;
I
only
told
her
to
say
messire

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
young
girls
dropped
their
eyes
.
The
man
,
who
asked
nothing
*NL*
better
than
to
enter
into
conversation
,
looked
at
them
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
have
nothing
to
say
to
me

damsels

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
nothing
at
all
,
''
replied
Gisquette
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing

''
said
Lienarde
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tall
,
light-haired
young
man
retreated
a
step
;
but
the
two
curious
*NL*
maidens
had
no
mind
to
let
slip
their
prize
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Messire
,
''
said
Gisquette
,
with
the
impetuosity
of
an
open
sluice
,
or
*NL*
of
a
woman
who
has
made
up
her
mind
,
``
do
you
know
that
soldier

is
to
*NL*
play
the
part
of
Madame
the
Virgin
in
the
mystery

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
the
part
of
Jupiter

replied
the
stranger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He

said
Lienarde
,
``

n't
she
stupid

So
you

*NL*
*NL*
``

replied
the
unknown
;
``
yes

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Lienarde
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will

they
are
about

inquired
Gisquette
,
*NL*
timidly

*NL*
``
Very

the
unknown
,
without
the

hesitation

``
Ah

responded
Lienarde
.

A
brief
silence
ensued

broken
by
the
stranger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
perfectly
new

one

``
Then
it

with
a
smile

And
for

Gisquette

``
the

growing
warm

``
Pierre
Corneille
''
with
more
*NL*
pride
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
readers
have
been
able
to
observe
,
that
a
certain
amount
of
time
*NL*
must
have
already
elapsed
from
the
moment
when
Jupiter
had
retired
*NL*
beneath
the
tapestry
to
the
instant
when
the
author
of
the
new
morality
*NL*
had
thus
abruptly
revealed
himself
to
the
innocent
admiration
of
*NL*
Gisquette
and
Lienarde
.
Remarkable
fact
:
that
whole
crowd
,
so
tumultuous
*NL*
but
a
few
moments
before
,
now
waited
amiably
on
the
word
of
the
*NL*
comedian
;
which
proves
the
eternal
truth
,
still
experienced
every
day
in
*NL*
our
theatres
,
that
the
best
means
of
making
the
public
wait
patiently
is
*NL*
to
assure
them
that
one
is
about
to
begin
instantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
scholar
Johannes
had
not
fallen
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hola
he
!
''
he
shouted
suddenly
,
in
the
midst
of
the
peaceable
waiting
*NL*
which
had
followed
the
tumult
.
``
Jupiter
,
Madame
the
Virgin
,
buffoons
of
*NL*
the
devil
!
are
you
jeering
at
us
?
The
piece
!
the
piece
!
commence
or
we
*NL*
will
commence
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
all
that
was
needed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
music
of
high
and
low
instruments
immediately
became
audible
from
*NL*
the
interior
of
the
stage
;
the
tapestry
was
raised
;
four
personages
,
*NL*
in
motley
attire
and
painted
faces
,
emerged
from
it
,
climbed
the
steep
*NL*
ladder
of
the
theatre
,
and
,
arrived
upon
the
upper
platform
,
arranged
*NL*
themselves
in
a
line
before
the
public
,
whom
they
saluted
with
profound
*NL*
reverences
;
then
the
symphony
ceased
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mystery
was
about
to
begin
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
four
personages
,
after
having
reaped
a
rich
reward
of
applause
for
*NL*
their
reverences
,
began
,
in
the
midst
of
profound
silence
,
a
prologue
,
*NL*
which
we
gladly
spare
the
reader
.
Moreover
,
as
happens
in
our
own
day
,
*NL*
the
public
was
more
occupied
with
the
costumes
that
the
actors
wore
than
*NL*
with
the
roles
that
they
were
enacting
;
and
,
in
truth
,
they
were
right
.
*NL*
All
four
were
dressed
in
parti-colored
robes
of
yellow
and
white
,
which
*NL*
were
distinguished
from
each
other
only
by
the
nature
of
the
stuff
;
the
*NL*
first
was
of
gold
and
silver
brocade
;
the
second
,
of
silk
;
the
third
,
of
*NL*
wool
;
the
fourth
,
of
linen
.
The
first
of
these
personages
carried
in
his
*NL*
right
hand
a
sword
;
the
second
,
two
golden
keys
;
the
third
,
a
pair
of
*NL*
scales
;
the
fourth
,
a
spade
:
and
,
in
order
to
aid
sluggish
minds
*NL*
which
would
not
have
seen
clearly
through
the
transparency
of
these
*NL*
attributes
,
there
was
to
be
read
,
in
large
,
black
letters
,
on
the
hem
of
*NL*
the
robe
of
brocade
,
MY
NAME
IS
NOBILITY
;
on
the
hem
of
the
silken
*NL*
robe
,
MY
NAME
IS
CLERGY
;
on
the
hem
of
the
woolen
robe
,
MY
NAME
IS
*NL*
MERCHANDISE
;
on
the
hem
of
the
linen
robe
,
MY
NAME
IS
LABOR
.
The
sex
*NL*
of
the
two
male
characters
was
briefly
indicated
to
every
judicious
*NL*
spectator
,
by
their
shorter
robes
,
and
by
the
cap
which
they
wore
on
*NL*
their
heads
;
while
the
two
female
characters
,
less
briefly
clad
,
were
*NL*
covered
with
hoods
.
*NL*
*NL*
Much
ill-will
would
also
have
been
required
,
not
to
comprehend
,
through
*NL*
the
medium
of
the
poetry
of
the
prologue
,
that
Labor
was
wedded
to
*NL*
Merchandise
,
and
Clergy
to
Nobility
,
and
that
the
two
happy
couples
*NL*
possessed
in
common
a
magnificent
golden
dolphin
,
which
they
desired
*NL*
to
adjudge
to
the
fairest
only
.
So
they
were
roaming
about
the
world
*NL*
seeking
and
searching
for
this
beauty
,
and
,
after
having
successively
*NL*
rejected
the
Queen
of
Golconda
,
the
Princess
of
Trebizonde
,
the
daughter
*NL*
of
the
Grand
Khan
of
Tartary
,
etc.
,
Labor
and
Clergy
,
Nobility
and
*NL*
Merchandise
,
had
come
to
rest
upon
the
marble
table
of
the
Palais
de
*NL*
Justice
,
and
to
utter
,
in
the
presence
of
the
honest
audience
,
as
many
*NL*
sentences
and
maxims
as
could
then
be
dispensed
at
the
Faculty
of
Arts
,
*NL*
at
examinations
,
sophisms
,
determinances
,
figures
,
and
acts
,
where
the
*NL*
masters
took
their
degrees
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
was
,
in
fact
,
very
fine
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
in
that
throng
,
upon
which
the
four
allegories
vied
with
*NL*
each
other
in
pouring
out
floods
of
metaphors
,
there
was
no
ear
more
*NL*
attentive
,
no
heart
that
palpitated
more
,
not
an
eye
was
more
haggard
,
*NL*
no
neck
more
outstretched
,
than
the
eye
,
the
ear
,
the
neck
,
and
the
*NL*
heart
of
the
author
,
of
the
poet
,
of
that
brave
Pierre
Gringoire
,
who
*NL*
had
not
been
able
to
resist
,
a
moment
before
,
the
joy
of
telling
his
*NL*
name
to
two
pretty
girls
.
He
had
retreated
a
few
paces
from
them
,
behind
*NL*
his
pillar
,
and
there
he
listened
,
looked
,
enjoyed
.
The
amiable
applause
*NL*
which
had
greeted
the
beginning
of
his
prologue
was
still
echoing
in
*NL*
his
bosom
,
and
he
was
completely
absorbed
in
that
species
of
ecstatic
*NL*
contemplation
with
which
an
author
beholds
his
ideas
fall
,
one
by
one
,
*NL*
from
the
mouth
of
the
actor
into
the
vast
silence
of
the
audience
.
*NL*
Worthy
Pierre
Gringoire
!
*NL*
*NL*
It
pains
us
to
say
it
,
but
this
first
ecstasy
was
speedily
disturbed
.
*NL*
Hardly
had
Gringoire
raised
this
intoxicating
cup
of
joy
and
triumph
to
*NL*
his
lips
,
when
a
drop
of
bitterness
was
mingled
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
tattered
mendicant
,
who
could
not
collect
any
coins
,
lost
as
he
was
*NL*
in
the
midst
of
the
crowd
,
and
who
had
not
probably
found
sufficient
*NL*
indemnity
in
the
pockets
of
his
neighbors
,
had
hit
upon
the
idea
of
*NL*
perching
himself
upon
some
conspicuous
point
,
in
order
to
attract
looks
*NL*
and
alms
.
He
had
,
accordingly
,
hoisted
himself
,
during
the
first
verses
*NL*
of
the
prologue
,
with
the
aid
of
the
pillars
of
the
reserve
gallery
,
to
*NL*
the
cornice
which
ran
round
the
balustrade
at
its
lower
edge
;
and
there
*NL*
he
had
seated
himself
,
soliciting
the
attention
and
the
pity
of
the
*NL*
multitude
,
with
his
rags
and
a
hideous
sore
which
covered
his
right
arm
.
*NL*
However
,
he
uttered
not
a
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
silence
which
he
preserved
allowed
the
prologue
to
proceed
without
*NL*
hindrance
,
and
no
perceptible
disorder
would
have
ensued
,
if
ill-luck
*NL*
had
not
willed
that
the
scholar
Joannes
should
catch
sight
,
from
the
*NL*
heights
of
his
pillar
,
of
the
mendicant
and
his
grimaces
.
A
wild
fit
of
*NL*
laughter
took
possession
of
the
young
scamp
,
who
,
without
caring
that
he
*NL*
was
interrupting
the
spectacle
,
and
disturbing
the
universal
composure
,
*NL*
shouted
boldly
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
!
see
that
sickly
creature
asking
alms
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Any
one
who
has
thrown
a
stone
into
a
frog
pond
,
or
fired
a
shot
into
*NL*
a
covey
of
birds
,
can
form
an
idea
of
the
effect
produced
by
these
*NL*
incongruous
words
,
in
the
midst
of
the
general
attention
.
It
made
*NL*
Gringoire
shudder
as
though
it
had
been
an
electric
shock
.
The
prologue
*NL*
stopped
short
,
and
all
heads
turned
tumultuously
towards
the
beggar
,
*NL*
who
,
far
from
being
disconcerted
by
this
,
saw
,
in
this
incident
,
a
good
*NL*
opportunity
for
reaping
his
harvest
,
and
who
began
to
whine
in
a
doleful
*NL*
way
,
half
closing
his
eyes
the
while
,
--
``
Charity
,
please
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
upon
my
soul
,
''
resumed
Joannes
,
``
it
's
Clopin
Trouillefou
!
Hola
*NL*
he
,
my
friend
,
did
your
sore
bother
you
on
the
leg
,
that
you
have
*NL*
transferred
it
to
your
arm
?
''
So
saying
,
with
the
dexterity
of
a
monkey
,
*NL*
he
flung
a
bit
of
silver
into
the
gray
felt
hat
which
the
beggar
held
*NL*
in
his
ailing
arm
.
The
mendicant
received
both
the
alms
and
the
sarcasm
*NL*
without
wincing
,
and
continued
,
in
lamentable
tones
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Charity
,
please
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
episode
considerably
distracted
the
attention
of
the
audience
;
and
*NL*
a
goodly
number
of
spectators
,
among
them
Robin
Poussepain
,
and
all
the
*NL*
clerks
at
their
head
,
gayly
applauded
this
eccentric
duet
,
which
the
*NL*
scholar
,
with
his
shrill
voice
,
and
the
mendicant
had
just
improvised
in
*NL*
the
middle
of
the
prologue
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gringoire
was
highly
displeased
.
On
recovering
from
his
first
*NL*
stupefaction
,
he
bestirred
himself
to
shout
,
to
the
four
personages
on
*NL*
the
stage
,
``
Go
on
!
What
the
devil
!
--
go
on
!
''
--
without
even
deigning
to
*NL*
cast
a
glance
of
disdain
upon
the
two
interrupters
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
,
he
felt
some
one
pluck
at
the
hem
of
his
surtout
;
*NL*
he
turned
round
,
and
not
without
ill-humor
,
and
found
considerable
*NL*
difficulty
in
smiling
;
but
he
was
obliged
to
do
so
,
nevertheless
.
It
*NL*
was
the
pretty
arm
of
Gisquette
la
Gencienne
,
which
,
passed
through
the
*NL*
railing
,
was
soliciting
his
attention
in
this
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
''
said
the
young
girl
,
``
are
they
going
to
continue
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
''
replied
Gringoire
,
a
good
deal
shocked
by
the
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
that
case
,
messire
,
''
she
resumed
,
``
would
you
have
the
courtesy
to
*NL*
explain
to
me
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
they
are
about
to
say
?
''
interrupted
Gringoire
.
``
Well
,
listen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Gisquette
,
``
but
what
they
have
said
so
far
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gringoire
started
,
like
a
man
whose
wound
has
been
probed
to
the
quick
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
plague
on
the
stupid
and
dull-witted
little
girl
!
''
he
muttered
,
*NL*
between
his
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
that
moment
forth
,
Gisquette
was
nothing
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
the
actors
had
obeyed
his
injunction
,
and
the
public
,
*NL*
seeing
that
they
were
beginning
to
speak
again
,
began
once
more
to
*NL*
listen
,
not
without
having
lost
many
beauties
in
the
sort
of
soldered
*NL*
joint
which
was
formed
between
the
two
portions
of
the
piece
thus
*NL*
abruptly
cut
short
.
Gringoire
commented
on
it
bitterly
to
himself
.
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
tranquillity
was
gradually
restored
,
the
scholar
held
his
*NL*
peace
,
the
mendicant
counted
over
some
coins
in
his
hat
,
and
the
piece
*NL*
resumed
the
upper
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
,
in
fact
,
a
very
fine
work
,
and
one
which
,
as
it
seems
to
us
,
*NL*
might
be
put
to
use
to-day
,
by
the
aid
of
a
little
rearrangement
.
The
*NL*
exposition
,
rather
long
and
rather
empty
,
that
is
to
say
,
according
to
*NL*
the
rules
,
was
simple
;
and
Gringoire
,
in
the
candid
sanctuary
of
his
own
*NL*
conscience
,
admired
its
clearness
.
As
the
reader
may
surmise
,
the
four
*NL*
allegorical
personages
were
somewhat
weary
with
having
traversed
the
*NL*
three
sections
of
the
world
,
without
having
found
suitable
opportunity
*NL*
for
getting
rid
of
their
golden
dolphin
.
Thereupon
a
eulogy
of
the
*NL*
marvellous
fish
,
with
a
thousand
delicate
allusions
to
the
young
*NL*
betrothed
of
Marguerite
of
Flanders
,
then
sadly
cloistered
in
at
*NL*
Amboise
,
and
without
a
suspicion
that
Labor
and
Clergy
,
Nobility
and
*NL*
Merchandise
had
just
made
the
circuit
of
the
world
in
his
behalf
.
The
*NL*
said
dauphin
was
then
young
,
was
handsome
,
was
stout
,
and
,
above
all
*NL*
-LRB-
magnificent
origin
of
all
royal
virtues
-RRB-
,
he
was
the
son
of
the
Lion
*NL*
of
France
.
I
declare
that
this
bold
metaphor
is
admirable
,
and
that
the
*NL*
natural
history
of
the
theatre
,
on
a
day
of
allegory
and
royal
marriage
*NL*
songs
,
is
not
in
the
least
startled
by
a
dolphin
who
is
the
son
of
a
*NL*
lion
.
It
is
precisely
these
rare
and
Pindaric
mixtures
which
prove
the
*NL*
poet
's
enthusiasm
.
Nevertheless
,
in
order
to
play
the
part
of
critic
*NL*
also
,
the
poet
might
have
developed
this
beautiful
idea
in
something
*NL*
less
than
two
hundred
lines
.
It
is
true
that
the
mystery
was
to
last
*NL*
from
noon
until
four
o'clock
,
in
accordance
with
the
orders
of
monsieur
*NL*
the
provost
,
and
that
it
was
necessary
to
say
something
.
Besides
,
the
*NL*
people
listened
patiently
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
,
in
the
very
middle
of
a
quarrel
between
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Merchandise
and
Madame
Nobility
,
at
the
moment
when
Monsieur
Labor
was
*NL*
giving
utterance
to
this
wonderful
line
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
In
forest
ne'er
was
seen
a
more
triumphant
beast
;
*NL*
*NL*
the
door
of
the
reserved
gallery
which
had
hitherto
remained
so
*NL*
inopportunely
closed
,
opened
still
more
inopportunely
;
and
the
ringing
*NL*
voice
of
the
usher
announced
abruptly
,
``
His
eminence
,
Monseigneur
the
*NL*
Cardinal
de
Bourbon

Poor
Gringoire
!
the
din
of
all
the
great
double
petards
of
the
*NL*
Saint-Jean
,
the
discharge
of
twenty
arquebuses
on
supports

famous
serpentine
of

twenty-sixth
of

*NL*
rudely
at
that
solemn
and
dramatic
moment
,
than
these
few
words
,
which
*NL*
fell
from
the
lips
of
the
usher
,
``
His
eminence
,
Monseigneur
the
Cardinal
*NL*
de
Bourbon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
not
that
Pierre
Gringoire
either
feared
or
disdained
monsieur
the
*NL*
cardinal
.
He
had
neither
the
weakness
nor
the
audacity
for
that
.
A
true
*NL*
eclectic
,
as
it
would
be
expressed
nowadays
,
Gringoire
was
one
of
those
*NL*
firm
and
lofty
,
moderate
and
calm
spirits
,
which
always
know
how
to
bear
*NL*
themselves
amid
all
circumstances
-LRB-
_
stare
in
dimidio
rerum
_
-RRB-
,
and
who
*NL*
are
full
of
reason
and
of
liberal
philosophy
,
while
still
setting
*NL*
store
by
cardinals
.
A
rare
,
precious
,
and
never
interrupted
race
of
*NL*
philosophers
to
whom
wisdom
,
like
another
Ariadne
,
seems
to
have
given
*NL*
a
clew
of
thread
which
they
have
been
walking
along
unwinding
since
*NL*
the
beginning
of
the
world
,
through
the
labyrinth
of
human
affairs
.
One
*NL*
finds
them
in
all
ages
,
ever
the
same
;
that
is
to
say
,
always
according
*NL*
to
all
times
.
And
,
without
reckoning
our
Pierre
Gringoire
,
who
may
*NL*
represent
them
in
the
fifteenth
century
if
we
succeed
in
bestowing
upon
*NL*
him
the
distinction
which
he
deserves
,
it
certainly
was
their
spirit
*NL*
which
animated
Father
du
Breul
,
when
he
wrote
,
in
the
sixteenth
,
these
*NL*
naively
sublime
words
,
worthy
of
all
centuries
:
``
I
am
a
Parisian
by
*NL*
nation
,
and
a
Parrhisian
in
language
,
for
_
parrhisia
_
in
Greek
signifies
*NL*
liberty
of
speech
;
of
which
I
have
made
use
even
towards
messeigneurs
*NL*
the
cardinals
,
uncle
and
brother
to
Monsieur
the
Prince
de
Conty
,
always
*NL*
with
respect
to
their
greatness
,
and
without
offending
any
one
of
their
*NL*
suite
,
which
is
much
to
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
then
neither
hatred
for
the
cardinal
,
nor
disdain
for
his
*NL*
presence
,
in
the
disagreeable
impression
produced
upon
Pierre
Gringoire
.
*NL*
Quite
the
contrary
;
our
poet
had
too
much
good
sense
and
too
threadbare
*NL*
a
coat
,
not
to
attach
particular
importance
to
having
the
numerous
*NL*
allusions
in
his
prologue
,
and
,
in
particular
,
the
glorification
of
the
*NL*
dauphin
,
son
of
the
Lion
of
France
,
fall
upon
the
most
eminent
ear
.
But
*NL*
it
is
not
interest
which
predominates
in
the
noble
nature
of
poets
.
I
*NL*
suppose
that
the
entity
of
the
poet
may
be
represented
by
the
number
*NL*
ten
;
it
is
certain
that
a
chemist
on
analyzing
and
pharmacopolizing
it
,
*NL*
as
Rabelais
says
,
would
find
it
composed
of
one
part
interest
to
nine
*NL*
parts
of
self-esteem
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
at
the
moment
when
the
door
had
opened
to
admit
the
cardinal
,
the
*NL*
nine
parts
of
self-esteem
in
Gringoire
,
swollen
and
expanded
by
*NL*
the
breath
of
popular
admiration
,
were
in
a
state
of
prodigious
*NL*
augmentation
,
beneath
which
disappeared
,
as
though
stifled
,
that
*NL*
imperceptible
molecule
of
which
we
have
just
remarked
upon
in
the
*NL*
constitution
of
poets
;
a
precious
ingredient
,
by
the
way
,
a
ballast
*NL*
of
reality
and
humanity
,
without
which
they
would
not
touch
the
earth
.
*NL*
Gringoire
enjoyed
seeing
,
feeling
,
fingering
,
so
to
speak
an
entire
*NL*
assembly
-LRB-
of
knaves
,
it
is
true
,
but
what
matters
that
?
-RRB-
stupefied
,
*NL*
petrified
,
and
as
though
asphyxiated
in
the
presence
of
the
*NL*
incommensurable
tirades
which
welled
up
every
instant
from
all
parts
*NL*
of
his
bridal
song
.
I
affirm
that
he
shared
the
general
beatitude
,
and
*NL*
that
,
quite
the
reverse
of
La
Fontaine
,
who
,
at
the
presentation
of
his
*NL*
comedy
of
the
``
Florentine
,
''
asked
,
``
Who
is
the
ill-bred
lout
who
made
*NL*
that
rhapsody
?
''
Gringoire
would
gladly
have
inquired
of
his
neighbor
,
*NL*
``
Whose
masterpiece
is
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
can
now
judge
of
the
effect
produced
upon
him
by
the
abrupt
*NL*
and
unseasonable
arrival
of
the
cardinal
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
which
he
had
to
fear
was
only
too
fully
realized
.
The
entrance
of
*NL*
his
eminence
upset
the
audience
.
All
heads
turned
towards
the
gallery
.
*NL*
It
was
no
longer
possible
to
hear
one
's
self
.
``
The
cardinal
!
The
*NL*
cardinal
!
''
repeated
all
mouths
.
The
unhappy
prologue
stopped
short
for
*NL*
the
second
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cardinal
halted
for
a
moment
on
the
threshold
of
the
estrade
.
While
*NL*
he
was
sending
a
rather
indifferent
glance
around
the
audience
,
the
*NL*
tumult
redoubled
.
Each
person
wished
to
get
a
better
view
of
him
.
*NL*
Each
man
vied
with
the
other
in
thrusting
his
head
over
his
neighbor
's
*NL*
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
,
in
fact
,
an
exalted
personage
,
the
sight
of
whom
was
well
worth
*NL*
any
other
comedy
.
Charles
,
Cardinal
de
Bourbon
,
Archbishop
and
Comte
of
*NL*
Lyon
,
Primate
of
the
Gauls
,
was
allied
both
to
Louis
XI.
,
through
his
*NL*
brother
,
Pierre
,
Seigneur
de
Beaujeu
,
who
had
married
the
king
's
eldest
*NL*
daughter
,
and
to
Charles
the
Bold
through
his
mother
,
Agnes
of
Burgundy
.
*NL*
Now
,
the
dominating
trait
,
the
peculiar
and
distinctive
trait
of
the
*NL*
character
of
the
Primate
of
the
Gauls
,
was
the
spirit
of
the
courtier
,
*NL*
and
devotion
to
the
powers
that
be
.
The
reader
can
form
an
idea
of
the
*NL*
numberless
embarrassments
which
this
double
relationship
had
caused
him
,
*NL*
and
of
all
the
temporal
reefs
among
which
his
spiritual
bark
had
been
*NL*
forced
to
tack
,
in
order
not
to
suffer
shipwreck
on
either
Louis
or
*NL*
Charles
,
that
Scylla
and
that
Charybdis
which
had
devoured
the
Duc
de
*NL*
Nemours
and
the
Constable
de
Saint-Pol
.
Thanks
to
Heaven
's
mercy
,
he
had
*NL*
made
the
voyage
successfully
,
and
had
reached
home
without
hindrance
.
*NL*
But
although
he
was
in
port
,
and
precisely
because
he
was
in
port
,
he
*NL*
never
recalled
without
disquiet
the
varied
haps
of
his
political
career
,
*NL*
so
long
uneasy
and
laborious
.
Thus
,
he
was
in
the
habit
of
saying
that
*NL*
the
year
1476
had
been
``
white
and
black
''
for
him
--
meaning
thereby
,
that
*NL*
in
the
course
of
that
year
he
had
lost
his
mother
,
the
Duchesse
de
la
*NL*
Bourbonnais
,
and
his
cousin
,
the
Duke
of
Burgundy
,
and
that
one
grief
*NL*
had
consoled
him
for
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
he
was
a
fine
man
;
he
led
a
joyous
cardinal
's
life
,
liked
*NL*
to
enliven
himself
with
the
royal
vintage
of
Challuau
,
did
not
hate
*NL*
Richarde
la
Garmoise
and
Thomasse
la
Saillarde
,
bestowed
alms
on
pretty
*NL*
girls
rather
than
on
old
women
,
--
and
for
all
these
reasons
was
very
*NL*
agreeable
to
the
populace
of
Paris
.
He
never
went
about
otherwise
*NL*
than
surrounded
by
a
small
court
of
bishops
and
abbes
of
high
lineage
,
*NL*
gallant
,
jovial
,
and
given
to
carousing
on
occasion
;
and
more
than
once
*NL*
the
good
and
devout
women
of
Saint
Germain
d'
Auxerre
,
when
passing
*NL*
at
night
beneath
the
brightly
illuminated
windows
of
Bourbon
,
had
been
*NL*
scandalized
to
hear
the
same
voices
which
had
intoned
vespers
for
*NL*
them
during
the
day
carolling
,
to
the
clinking
of
glasses
,
the
bacchic
*NL*
proverb
of
Benedict
XII.
,
that
pope
who
had
added
a
third
crown
to
the
*NL*
Tiara
--
_
Bibamus
papaliter
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
this
justly
acquired
popularity
,
no
doubt
,
which
preserved
him
on
*NL*
his
entrance
from
any
bad
reception
at
the
hands
of
the
mob
,
which
had
*NL*
been
so
displeased
but
a
moment
before
,
and
very
little
disposed
to
*NL*
respect
a
cardinal
on
the
very
day
when
it
was
to
elect
a
pope
.
But
the
*NL*
Parisians
cherish
little
rancor
;
and
then
,
having
forced
the
beginning
*NL*
of
the
play
by
their
authority
,
the
good
bourgeois
had
got
the
upper
*NL*
hand
of
the
cardinal
,
and
this
triumph
was
sufficient
for
them
.
*NL*
Moreover
,
the
Cardinal
de
Bourbon
was
a
handsome
man
,
--
he
wore
a
fine
*NL*
scarlet
robe
,
which
he
carried
off
very
well
,
--
that
is
to
say
,
he
had
*NL*
all
the
women
on
his
side
,
and
,
consequently
,
the
best
half
of
the
*NL*
audience
.
Assuredly
,
it
would
be
injustice
and
bad
taste
to
hoot
a
*NL*
cardinal
for
having
come
late
to
the
spectacle
,
when
he
is
a
handsome
*NL*
man
,
and
when
he
wears
his
scarlet
robe
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
entered
,
then
,
bowed
to
those
present
with
the
hereditary
smile
of
*NL*
the
great
for
the
people
,
and
directed
his
course
slowly
towards
his
*NL*
scarlet
velvet
arm-chair
,
with
the
air
of
thinking
of
something
quite
*NL*
different
.
His
cortege
--
what
we
should
nowadays
call
his
staff
--
of
*NL*
bishops
and
abbes
invaded
the
estrade
in
his
train
,
not
without
causing
*NL*
redoubled
tumult
and
curiosity
among
the
audience
.
Each
man
vied
with
*NL*
his
neighbor
in
pointing
them
out
and
naming
them
,
in
seeing
who
should
*NL*
recognize
at
least
one
of
them
:
this
one
,
the
Bishop
of
Marseilles
*NL*
-LRB-
Alaudet
,
if
my
memory
serves
me
right
-RRB-
;
--
this
one
,
the
primicier
of
*NL*
Saint-Denis
;
--
this
one
,
Robert
de
Lespinasse
,
Abbe
of
Saint-Germain
des
*NL*
Pres
,
that
libertine
brother
of
a
mistress
of
Louis
XI.
;
all
with
many
*NL*
errors
and
absurdities
.
As
for
the
scholars
,
they
swore
.
This
was
their
*NL*
day
,
their
feast
of
fools
,
their
saturnalia
,
the
annual
orgy
of
the
*NL*
corporation
of
Law
clerks
and
of
the
school
.
There
was
no
turpitude
*NL*
which
was
not
sacred
on
that
day
.
And
then
there
were
gay
gossips
in
the
*NL*
crowd
--
Simone
Quatrelivres
,
Agnes
la
Gadine
,
and
Rabine
Piedebou
.
Was
*NL*
it
not
the
least
that
one
could
do
to
swear
at
one
's
ease
and
revile
*NL*
the
name
of
God
a
little
,
on
so
fine
a
day
,
in
such
good
company
as
*NL*
dignitaries
of
the
church
and
loose
women
?
So
they
did
not
abstain
;
and
,
*NL*
in
the
midst
of
the
uproar
,
there
was
a
frightful
concert
of
blasphemies
*NL*
and
enormities
of
all
the
unbridled
tongues
,
the
tongues
of
clerks
and
*NL*
students
restrained
during
the
rest
of
the
year
,
by
the
fear
of
the
hot
*NL*
iron
of
Saint
Louis
.
Poor
Saint
Louis
!
how
they
set
him
at
defiance
in
*NL*
his
own
court
of
law
!
Each
one
of
them
selected
from
the
new-comers
on
*NL*
the
platform
,
a
black
,
gray
,
white
,
or
violet
cassock
as
his
target
.
*NL*
Joannes
Frollo
de
Molendin
,
in
his
quality
of
brother
to
an
archdeacon
,
*NL*
boldly
attacked
the
scarlet
;
he
sang
in
deafening
tones
,
with
his
*NL*
impudent
eyes
fastened
on
the
cardinal
,
''
_
Cappa
repleta
mero
_
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
these
details
which
we
here
lay
bare
for
the
edification
of
the
*NL*
reader
,
were
so
covered
by
the
general
uproar
,
that
they
were
lost
in
it
*NL*
before
reaching
the
reserved
platforms
;
moreover
,
they
would
have
*NL*
moved
the
cardinal
but
little
,
so
much
a
part
of
the
customs
were
the
*NL*
liberties
of
that
day
.
Moreover
,
he
had
another
cause
for
solicitude
,
*NL*
and
his
mien
as
wholly
preoccupied
with
it
,
which
entered
the
estrade
*NL*
the
same
time
as
himself
;
this
was
the
embassy
from
Flanders
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
that
he
was
a
profound
politician
,
nor
was
he
borrowing
trouble
*NL*
about
the
possible
consequences
of
the
marriage
of
his
cousin
Marguerite
*NL*
de
Bourgoyne
to
his
cousin
Charles
,
Dauphin
de
Vienne
;
nor
as
to
how
*NL*
long
the
good
understanding
which
had
been
patched
up
between
the
*NL*
Duke
of
Austria
and
the
King
of
France
would
last
;
nor
how
the
King
of
*NL*
England
would
take
this
disdain
of
his
daughter
.
All
that
troubled
him
*NL*
but
little
;
and
he
gave
a
warm
reception
every
evening
to
the
wine
of
*NL*
the
royal
vintage
of
Chaillot
,
without
a
suspicion
that
several
flasks
*NL*
of
that
same
wine
-LRB-
somewhat
revised
and
corrected
,
it
is
true
,
by
Doctor
*NL*
Coictier
-RRB-
,
cordially
offered
to
Edward
IV
.
by
Louis
XI.
,
would
,
some
*NL*
fine
morning
,
rid
Louis
XI
.
of
Edward
IV
.
``
The
much
honored
embassy
of
*NL*
Monsieur
the
Duke
of
Austria
,
''
brought
the
cardinal
none
of
these
cares
,
*NL*
but
it
troubled
him
in
another
direction
.
It
was
,
in
fact
,
somewhat
*NL*
hard
,
and
we
have
already
hinted
at
it
on
the
second
page
of
this
*NL*
book
,
--
for
him
,
Charles
de
Bourbon
,
to
be
obliged
to
feast
and
receive
*NL*
cordially
no
one
knows
what
bourgeois
;
--
for
him
,
a
cardinal
,
to
receive
*NL*
aldermen
;
--
for
him
,
a
Frenchman
,
and
a
jolly
companion
,
to
receive
*NL*
Flemish
beer-drinkers
,
--
and
that
in
public
!
This
was
,
certainly
,
one
*NL*
of
the
most
irksome
grimaces
that
he
had
ever
executed
for
the
good
*NL*
pleasure
of
the
king
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
turned
toward
the
door
,
and
with
the
best
grace
in
the
world
*NL*
-LRB-
so
well
had
he
trained
himself
to
it
-RRB-
,
when
the
usher
announced
,
in
a
*NL*
sonorous
voice
,
``
Messieurs
the
Envoys
of
Monsieur
the
Duke
of
Austria
.
''
*NL*
It
is
useless
to
add
that
the
whole
hall
did
the
same
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
arrived
,
two
by
two
,
with
a
gravity
which
made
a
contrast
in
the
*NL*
midst
of
the
frisky
ecclesiastical
escort
of
Charles
de
Bourbon
,
the
*NL*
eight
and
forty
ambassadors
of
Maximilian
of
Austria
,

Father
in

Chancellor
of
the
Golden
Fleece
,
and
Jacques
de
Goy
,
Sieur
Dauby
,
Grand
*NL*
Bailiff
of
Ghent
.
A
deep
silence
settled
over
the
assembly
,
accompanied
*NL*
by
stifled
laughter
at
the
preposterous
names
and
all
the
bourgeois
*NL*
designations
which
each
of
these
personages
transmitted
with
*NL*
imperturbable
gravity
to
the
usher
,
who
then
tossed
names
and
titles
*NL*
pell-mell
and
mutilated
to
the
crowd
below
.
There
were
Master
Loys
*NL*
Roelof
,
alderman
of
the
city
of
Louvain
;
Messire
Clays
d'Etuelde
,
*NL*

;

,
first
alderman
of
the

of

the

;
Master
Gheldolf
van
der
Hage
,
first
alderman
of
the

of
the

,
and

,

;
bailiffs
,
aldermen
,
*NL*
burgomasters
;
burgomasters
,
aldermen
,
bailiffs
--
all
stiff
,
affectedly
*NL*
grave
,
formal
,
dressed
out
in
velvet
and
damask
,
hooded
with
caps
of
*NL*
black
velvet
,
with
great
tufts
of
Cyprus
gold
thread
;
good
Flemish
*NL*
heads
,
after
all
,
severe
and
worthy
faces
,
of
the
family
which
Rembrandt
*NL*
makes
to
stand
out
so
strong
and
grave
from
the
black
background
of
his
*NL*
``
Night
Patrol
''
;
personages
all
of
whom
bore
,
written
on
their
brows
,
*NL*
that
Maximilian
of
Austria
had
done
well
in
``
trusting
implicitly
,
''
as
*NL*
the
manifest
ran
,
``
in
their
sense
,
valor
,
experience
,
loyalty
,
and
good
*NL*
wisdom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
one
exception
,
however
.
It
was
a
subtle
,
intelligent
,
*NL*
crafty-looking
face
,
a
sort
of
combined
monkey
and
diplomat
phiz
,
before
*NL*
whom
the
cardinal
made
three
steps
and
a
profound
bow
,
and
whose
name
,
*NL*
nevertheless
,
was
only
,
``
Guillaume
Rym
,
counsellor
and
pensioner
of
the
*NL*
City
of
Ghent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Few
persons
were
then
aware
who
Guillaume
Rym
was
.
A
rare
genius
who
*NL*
in
a
time
of
revolution
would
have
made
a
brilliant
appearance
on
the
*NL*
surface
of
events
,
but
who
in
the
fifteenth
century
was
reduced
to
*NL*
cavernous
intrigues
,
and
to
``
living
in
mines
,
''
as
the
Duc
de
Saint-Simon
*NL*
expresses
it
.
Nevertheless
,
he
was
appreciated
by
the
``
miner
''
of
Europe
;
*NL*
he
plotted
familiarly
with
Louis
XI.
,
and
often
lent
a
hand
to
the
*NL*
king
's
secret
jobs
.
All
which
things
were
quite
unknown
to
that
throng
,
*NL*
who
were
amazed
at
the
cardinal
's
politeness
to
that
frail
figure
of
a
*NL*
Flemish
bailiff
.

CHAPTER
IV
.
MASTER
JACQUES
COPPENOLE
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
pensioner
of
Ghent
and
his
eminence
were
exchanging
very
low
*NL*
bows
and
a
few
words
in
voices
still
lower
,
a
man
of
lofty
stature
,
with
*NL*
a
large
face
and
broad
shoulders
,
presented
himself
,
in
order
to
enter
*NL*
abreast
with
Guillaume
Rym
;
one
would
have
pronounced
him
a
bull-dog
by
*NL*
the
side
of
a
fox
.
His
felt
doublet
and
leather
jerkin
made
a
spot
on
*NL*
the
velvet
and
silk
which
surrounded
him
.
Presuming
that
he
was
some
*NL*
groom
who
had
stolen
in
,
the
usher
stopped
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
,
my
friend
,
you
can
not
pass
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
in
the
leather
jerkin
shouldered
him
aside
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
this
knave
want
with
me
?
''
said
he
,
in
stentorian
tones
,
which
*NL*
rendered
the
entire
hall
attentive
to
this
strange
colloquy
.
``
Do
n't
you
*NL*
see
that
I
am
one
of
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
name
?
''
demanded
the
usher
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jacques
Coppenole
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
titles
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hosier
at
the
sign
of
the
`
Three
Little
Chains
,
'
of
Ghent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
usher
recoiled
.
One
might
bring
one
's
self
to
announce
aldermen
and
*NL*
burgomasters
,
but
a
hosier
was
too
much
.
The
cardinal
was
on
thorns
.
*NL*
All
the
people
were
staring
and
listening
.
For
two
days
his
eminence
had
*NL*
been
exerting
his
utmost
efforts
to
lick
these
Flemish
bears
into
shape
,
*NL*
and
to
render
them
a
little
more
presentable
to
the
public
,
and
this
*NL*
freak
was
startling
.
But
Guillaume
Rym
,
with
his
polished
smile
,
*NL*
approached
the
usher
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Announce
Master
Jacques
Coppenole
,
clerk
of
the
aldermen
of
the
city
of
*NL*
Ghent
,
''
he
whispered
,
very
low
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Usher
,
''
interposed
the
cardinal
,
aloud
,
``
announce
Master
Jacques
*NL*
Coppenole
,
clerk
of
the
aldermen
of
the
illustrious
city
of
Ghent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
mistake
.
Guillaume
Rym
alone
might
have
conjured
away
the
*NL*
difficulty
,
but
Coppenole
had
heard
the
cardinal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
cross
of
God
?
''
he
exclaimed
,
in
his
voice
of
thunder
,
``
Jacques
*NL*
Coppenole
,
hosier
.
Do
you
hear
,
usher
?
Nothing
more
,
nothing
less
.
Cross
*NL*
of
God
!
hosier
;
that
's
fine
enough
.
Monsieur
the
Archduke
has
more
than
*NL*
once
sought
his
_
gant
_
*
in
my
hose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
Got
the
first
idea
of
a
timing
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Laughter
and
applause
burst
forth
.
A
jest
is
always
understood
in
Paris
,
*NL*
and
,
consequently
,
always
applauded
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
add
that
Coppenole
was
of
the
people
,
and
that
the
auditors
which
*NL*
surrounded
him
were
also
of
the
people
.
Thus
the
communication
between
*NL*
him
and
them
had
been
prompt
,
electric
,
and
,
so
to
speak
,
on
a
level
.
*NL*
The
haughty
air
of
the
Flemish
hosier
,
by
humiliating
the
courtiers
,
*NL*
had
touched
in
all
these
plebeian
souls
that
latent
sentiment
of
dignity
*NL*
still
vague
and
indistinct
in
the
fifteenth
century
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
hosier
was
an
equal
,
who
had
just
held
his
own
before
monsieur
the
*NL*
cardinal
.
A
very
sweet
reflection
to
poor
fellows
habituated
to
respect
*NL*
and
obedience
towards
the
underlings
of
the
sergeants
of
the
bailiff
of
*NL*
Sainte-Genevieve
,
the
cardinal
's
train-bearer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Coppenole
proudly
saluted
his
eminence
,
who
returned
the
salute
of
the
*NL*
all-powerful
bourgeois
feared
by
Louis
XI
.
Then
,
while
Guillaume
Rym
,
a
*NL*
``
sage
and
malicious
man
,
''
as
Philippe
de
Comines
puts
it
,
watched
them
*NL*
both
with
a
smile
of
raillery
and
superiority
,
each
sought
his
place
,
*NL*
the
cardinal
quite
abashed
and
troubled
,
Coppenole
tranquil
and
haughty
,
*NL*
and
thinking
,
no
doubt
,
that
his
title
of
hosier
was
as
good
as
any
*NL*
other
,
after
all
,
and
that
Marie
of
Burgundy
,
mother
to
that
Marguerite
*NL*
whom
Coppenole
was
to-day
bestowing
in
marriage
,
would
have
been
less
*NL*
afraid
of
the
cardinal
than
of
the
hosier
;
for
it
is
not
a
cardinal
*NL*
who
would
have
stirred
up
a
revolt
among
the
men
of
Ghent
against
the
*NL*
favorites
of
the
daughter
of
Charles
the
Bold
;
it
is
not
a
cardinal
*NL*
who
could
have
fortified
the
populace
with
a
word
against
her
tears
*NL*
and
prayers
,
when
the
Maid
of
Flanders
came
to
supplicate
her
people
in
*NL*
their
behalf
,
even
at
the
very
foot
of
the
scaffold
;
while
the
hosier
*NL*
had
only
to
raise
his
leather
elbow
,
in
order
to
cause
to
fall
your
*NL*
two
heads
,
most
illustrious
seigneurs
,
Guy
d'Hymbercourt
and
Chancellor
*NL*
Guillaume
Hugonet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
all
was
over
for
the
poor
cardinal
,
and
he
was
obliged
to
*NL*
quaff
to
the
dregs
the
bitter
cup
of
being
in
such
b
ad
company
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
has
,
probably
,
not
forgotten
the
impudent
beggar
who
had
been
*NL*
clinging
fast
to
the
fringes
of
the
cardinal
's
gallery
ever
since
the
*NL*
beginning
of
the
prologue
.
The
arrival
of
the
illustrious
guests
had
*NL*
by
no
means
caused
him
to
relax
his
hold
,
and
,
while
the
prelates
*NL*
and
ambassadors
were
packing
themselves
into
the
stalls
--
like
genuine
*NL*
Flemish
herrings
--
he
settled
himself
at
his
ease
,
and
boldly
crossed
*NL*
his
legs
on
the
architrave
.
The
insolence
of
this
proceeding
was
*NL*
extraordinary
,
yet
no
one
noticed
it
at
first
,
the
attention
of
all
*NL*
being
directed
elsewhere
.
He
,
on
his
side
,
perceived
nothing
that
*NL*
was
going
on
in
the
hall
;
he
wagged
his
head
with
the
unconcern
of
a
*NL*
Neapolitan
,
repeating
from
time
to
time
,
amid
the
clamor
,
as
from
a
*NL*
mechanical
habit
,
``
Charity
,
please
!
''
And
,
assuredly
,
he
was
,
out
of
all
*NL*
those
present
,
the
only
one
who
had
not
deigned
to
turn
his
head
at
the
*NL*
altercation
between
Coppenole
and
the
usher
.
Now
,
chance
ordained
that
*NL*
the
master
hosier
of
Ghent
,
with
whom
the
people
were
already
in
lively
*NL*
sympathy
,
and
upon
whom
all
eyes
were
riveted
--
should
come
and
seat
*NL*
himself
in
the
front
row
of
the
gallery
,
directly
above
the
mendicant
;
*NL*
and
people
were
not
a
little
amazed
to
see
the
Flemish
ambassador
,
on
*NL*
concluding
his
inspection
of
the
knave
thus
placed
beneath
his
eyes
,
*NL*
bestow
a
friendly
tap
on
that
ragged
shoulder
.
The
beggar
turned
round
;
*NL*
there
was
surprise
,
recognition
,
a
lighting
up
of
the
two
countenances
,
*NL*
and
so
forth
;
then
,
without
paying
the
slightest
heed
in
the
world
to
*NL*
the
spectators
,
the
hosier
and
the
wretched
being
began
to
converse
in
a
*NL*
low
tone
,
holding
each
other
's
hands
,
in
the
meantime
,
while
the
rags
*NL*
of
Clopin
Trouillefou
,
spread
out
upon
the
cloth
of
gold
of
the
dais
,
*NL*
produced
the
effect
of
a
caterpillar
on
an
orange
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
novelty
of
this
singular
scene
excited
such
a
murmur
of
mirth
and
*NL*
gayety
in
the
hall
,
that
the
cardinal
was
not
slow
to
perceive
it
;
he
*NL*
half
bent
forward
,
and
,
as
from
the
point
where
he
was
placed
he
could
*NL*
catch
only
an
imperfect
view
of
Trouillerfou
's
ignominious
doublet
,
*NL*
he
very
naturally
imagined
that
the
mendicant
was
asking
alms
,
and
,
*NL*
disgusted
with
his
audacity
,
he
exclaimed
:
``
Bailiff
of
the
Courts
,
toss
*NL*
me
that
knave
into
the
river
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cross
of
God
!
monseigneur
the
cardinal
,
''
said
Coppenole
,
without
*NL*
quitting
Clopin
's
hand
,
``
he
's
a
friend
of
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
!
good
!
''
shouted
the
populace
.
From
that
moment
,
Master
Coppenole
*NL*
enjoyed
in
Paris
as
in
Ghent
,
``
great
favor
with
the
people
;
for
men
of
*NL*
that
sort
do
enjoy
it
,
''
says
Philippe
de
Comines
,
``
when
they
are
thus
*NL*
disorderly
.
''
The
cardinal
bit
his
lips
.
He
bent
towards
his
neighbor
,
*NL*
the
Abbe
of
Saint
Genevieve
,
and
said
to
him
in
a
low
tone
,
--
``
Fine
*NL*
ambassadors
monsieur
the
archduke
sends
here
,
to
announce
to
us
Madame
*NL*
Marguerite
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
eminence
,
''
replied
the
abbe
,
``
wastes
your
politeness
on
these
*NL*
Flemish
swine
.
_
Margaritas
ante
porcos
_
,
pearls
before
swine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
rather
,
''
retorted
the
cardinal
,
with
a
smile
,
''
_
Porcos
ante
*NL*
Margaritam
_
,
swine
before
the
pearl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
little
court
in
cassocks
went
into
ecstacies
over
this
play
*NL*
upon
words
.
The
cardinal
felt
a
little
relieved
;
he
was
quits
with
*NL*
Coppenole
,
he
also
had
had
his
jest
applauded
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
will
those
of
our
readers
who
possess
the
power
of
generalizing
an
*NL*
image
or
an
idea
,
as
the
expression
runs
in
the
style
of
to-day
,
permit
*NL*
us
to
ask
them
if
they
have
formed
a
very
clear
conception
of
the
*NL*
spectacle
presented
at
this
moment
,
upon
which
we
have
arrested
their
*NL*
attention
,
by
the
vast
parallelogram
of
the
grand
hall
of
the
palace
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
middle
of
the
hall
,
backed
against
the
western
wall
,
a
large
*NL*
and
magnificent
gallery
draped
with
cloth
of
gold
,
into
which
enter
in
*NL*
procession
,
through
a
small
,
arched
door
,
grave
personages
,
announced
*NL*
successively
by
the
shrill
voice
of
an
usher
.
On
the
front
benches
were
*NL*
already
a
number
of
venerable
figures
,
muffled
in
ermine
,
velvet
,
and
*NL*
scarlet
.
Around
the
dais
--
which
remains
silent
and
dignified
--
below
,
*NL*
opposite
,
everywhere
,
a
great
crowd
and
a
great
murmur
.
Thousands
of
*NL*
glances
directed
by
the
people
on
each
face
upon
the
dais
,
a
thousand
*NL*
whispers
over
each
name
.
Certainly
,
the
spectacle
is
curious
,
and
well
*NL*
deserves
the
attention
of
the
spectators
.
But
yonder
,
quite
at
the
end
,
*NL*
what
is
that
sort
of
trestle
work
with
four
motley
puppets
upon
it
,
and
*NL*
more
below
?
Who
is
that
man
beside
the
trestle
,
with
a
black
doublet
*NL*
and
a
pale
face
?
Alas
!
my
dear
reader
,
it
is
Pierre
Gringoire
and
his
*NL*
prologue
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
all
forgotten
him
completely
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
precisely
what
he
feared
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
moment
of
the
cardinal
's
entrance
,
Gringoire
had
never
ceased
*NL*
to
tremble
for
the
safety
of
his
prologue
.
At
first
he
had
enjoined
the
*NL*
actors
,
who
had
stopped
in
suspense
,
to
continue
,
and
to
raise
their
*NL*
voices
;
then
,
perceiving
that
no
one
was
listening
,
he
had
stopped
them
;
*NL*
and
,
during
the
entire
quarter
of
an
hour
that
the
interruption
lasted
,
*NL*
he
had
not
ceased
to
stamp
,
to
flounce
about
,
to
appeal
to
Gisquette
and
*NL*
Lienarde
,
and
to
urge
his
neighbors
to
the
continuance
of
the
prologue
;
*NL*
all
in
vain
.
No
one
quitted
the
cardinal
,
the
embassy
,
and
the
*NL*
gallery
--
sole
centre
of
this
vast
circle
of
visual
rays
.
We
must
also
*NL*
believe
,
and
we
say
it
with
regret
,
that
the
prologue
had
begun
slightly
*NL*
to
weary
the
audience
at
the
moment
when
his
eminence
had
arrived
,
and
*NL*
created
a
diversion
in
so
terrible
a
fashion
.
After
all
,
on
the
gallery
*NL*
as
well
as
on
the
marble
table
,
the
spectacle
was
the
same
:
the
conflict
*NL*
of
Labor
and
Clergy
,
of
Nobility
and
Merchandise
.
And
many
people
*NL*
preferred
to
see
them
alive
,
breathing
,
moving
,
elbowing
each
other
in
*NL*
flesh
and
blood
,
in
this
Flemish
embassy
,
in
this
Episcopal
court
,
under
*NL*
the
cardinal
's
robe
,
under
Coppenole
's
jerkin
,
than
painted
,
decked
*NL*
out
,
talking
in
verse
,
and
,
so
to
speak
,
stuffed
beneath
the
yellow
amid
*NL*
white
tunics
in
which
Gringoire
had
so
ridiculously
clothed
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
when
our
poet
beheld
quiet
reestablished
to
some
extent
,
*NL*
he
devised
a
stratagem
which
might
have
redeemed
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
''
he
said
,
turning
towards
one
of
his
neighbors
,
a
fine
,
big
*NL*
man
,
with
a
patient
face
,
``
suppose
we
begin
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
said
his
neighbor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
!
the
Mystery
,
''
said
Gringoire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you
like
,
''
returned
his
neighbor
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
semi-approbation
sufficed
for
Gringoire
,
and
,
conducting
his
own
*NL*
affairs
,
he
began
to
shout
,
confounding
himself
with
the
crowd
as
much
*NL*
as
possible
:
``
Begin
the
mystery
again
!
begin
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
devil
!
''
said
Joannes
de
Molendino
,
``
what
are
they
jabbering
down
*NL*
yonder
,
at
the
end
of
the
hall
?
''
-LRB-
for
Gringoire
was
making
noise
enough
*NL*
for
four
.
-RRB-
``
Say
,
comrades
,
is
n't
that
mystery
finished
?
They
want
to
*NL*
begin
it
all
over
again
.
That
's
not
fair
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
!
''
shouted
all
the
scholars
.
``
Down
with
the
mystery
!
Down
with
*NL*
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Gringoire
had
multiplied
himself
,
and
only
shouted
the
more
*NL*
vigorously
:
``
Begin
again
!
begin
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
clamors
attracted
the
attention
of
the
cardinal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
Bailiff
of
the
Courts
,
''
said
he
to
a
tall
,
black
man
,
placed
a
*NL*
few
paces
from
him
,
``
are
those
knaves
in
a
holy-water
vessel
,
that
they
*NL*
make
such
a
hellish
noise
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
bailiff
of
the
courts
was
a
sort
of
amphibious
magistrate
,
a
sort
*NL*
of
bat
of
the
judicial
order
,
related
to
both
the
rat
and
the
bird
,
the
*NL*
judge
and
the
soldier
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
approached
his
eminence
,
and
not
without
a
good
deal
of
fear
of
*NL*
the
latter
's
displeasure
,
he
awkwardly
explained
to
him
the
seeming
*NL*
disrespect
of
the
audience
:
that
noonday
had
arrived
before
his
*NL*
eminence
,
and
that
the
comedians
had
been
forced
to
begin
without
*NL*
waiting
for
his
eminence
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cardinal
burst
into
a
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
my
faith
,
the
rector
of
the
university
ought
to
have
done
the
same
.
*NL*
What
say
you
,
Master
Guillaume
Rym
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monseigneur
,
''
replied
Guillaume
Rym
,
``
let
us
be
content
with
having
*NL*
escaped
half
of
the
comedy
.
There
is
at
least
that
much
gained
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
these
rascals
continue
their
farce
?
''
asked
the
bailiff
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Continue
,
continue
,
''
said
the
cardinal
,
``
it
's
all
the
same
to
me
.
I
'll
*NL*
read
my
breviary
in
the
meantime
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
bailiff
advanced
to
the
edge
of
the
estrade
,
and
cried
,
after
having
*NL*
invoked
silence
by
a
wave
of
the
hand
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bourgeois
,
rustics
,
and
citizens
,
in
order
to
satisfy
those
who
wish
*NL*
the
play
to
begin
again
,
and
those
who
wish
it
to
end
,
his
eminence
*NL*
orders
that
it
be
continued
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Both
parties
were
forced
to
resign
themselves
.
But
the
public
and
the
*NL*
author
long
cherished
a
grudge
against
the
cardinal
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
personages
on
the
stage
took
up
their
parts
,
and
Gringoire
hoped
*NL*
that
the
rest
of
his
work
,
at
least
,
would
be
listened
to
.
This
hope
was
*NL*
speedily
dispelled
like
his
other
illusions
;
silence
had
indeed
,
*NL*
been
restored
in
the
audience
,
after
a
fashion
;
but
Gringoire
had
*NL*
not
observed
that
at
the
moment
when
the
cardinal
gave
the
order
to
*NL*
continue
,
the
gallery
was
far
from
full
,
and
that
after
the
Flemish
*NL*
envoys
there
had
arrived
new
personages
forming
part
of
the
cortege
,
*NL*
whose
names
and
ranks
,
shouted
out
in
the
midst
of
his
dialogue
by
the
*NL*
intermittent
cry
of
the
usher
,
produced
considerable
ravages
in
it
.
Let
*NL*
the
reader
imagine
the
effect
in
the
midst
of
a
theatrical
piece
,
of
the
*NL*
yelping
of
an
usher
,
flinging
in
between
two
rhymes
,
and
often
in
the
*NL*
middle
of
a
line
,
parentheses
like
the
following
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``

Jacques
Charmolue

*NL*
*NL*
This
was
becoming
unbearable
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
strange
accompaniment
,
which
rendered
it
difficult
to
follow
*NL*
the
piece
,
made
Gringoire
all
the
more
indignant
because
he
could
*NL*
not
conceal
from
himself
the
fact
that
the
interest
was
continually
*NL*
increasing
,
and
that
all
his
work
required
was
a
chance
of
being
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
,
in
fact
,
difficult
to
imagine
a
more
ingenious
and
more
*NL*
dramatic
composition
.
The
four
personages
of
the
prologue
were
bewailing
*NL*
themselves
in
their
mortal
embarrassment
,
when
Venus
in
person
,
-LRB-
_
vera
*NL*
incessa
patuit
dea
_
-RRB-
presented
herself
to
them
,
clad
in
a
fine
robe
*NL*
bearing
the
heraldic
device
of
the
ship
of
the
city
of
Paris
.
She
*NL*
had
come
herself
to
claim
the
dolphin
promised
to
the
most
beautiful
.
*NL*
Jupiter
,
whose
thunder
could
be
heard
rumbling
in
the
dressing-room
,
*NL*
supported
her
claim
,
and
Venus
was
on
the
point
of
carrying
it
*NL*
off
,
--
that
is
to
say
,
without
allegory
,
of
marrying
monsieur
the
*NL*
dauphin
,
when
a
young
child
clad
in
white
damask
,
and
holding
in
her
*NL*
hand
a
daisy
-LRB-
a
transparent
personification
of
Mademoiselle
Marguerite
*NL*
of
Flanders
-RRB-
came
to
contest
it
with
Venus
.
*NL*
*NL*
Theatrical
effect
and
change
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
dispute
,
Venus
,
Marguerite
,
and
the
assistants
agreed
to
submit
*NL*
to
the
good
judgment
of
time
holy
Virgin
.
There
was
another
good
part
,
*NL*
that
of
the
king
of
Mesopotamia
;
but
through
so
many
interruptions
,
*NL*
it
was
difficult
to
make
out
what
end
he
served
.
All
these
persons
had
*NL*
ascended
by
the
ladder
to
the
stage
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
all
was
over
;
none
of
these
beauties
had
been
felt
nor
understood
.
*NL*
On
the
entrance
of
the
cardinal
,
one
would
have
said
that
an
invisible
*NL*
magic
thread
had
suddenly
drawn
all
glances
from
the
marble
table
to
the
*NL*
gallery
,
from
the
southern
to
the
western
extremity
of
the
hall
.
Nothing
*NL*
could
disenchant
the
audience
;
all
eyes
remained
fixed
there
,
and
*NL*
the
new-comers
and
their
accursed
names
,
and
their
faces
,
and
their
*NL*
costumes
,
afforded
a
continual
diversion
.
This
was
very
distressing
.
*NL*
With
the
exception
of
Gisquette
and
Lienarde
,
who
turned
round
from
time
*NL*
to
time
when
Gringoire
plucked
them
by
the
sleeve
;
with
the
exception
of
*NL*
the
big
,
patient
neighbor
,
no
one
listened
,
no
one
looked
at
the
poor
,
*NL*
deserted
morality
full
face
.
Gringoire
saw
only
profiles
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
what
bitterness
did
he
behold
his
whole
erection
of
glory
and
of
*NL*
poetry
crumble
away
bit
by
bit
!
And
to
think
that
these
people
had
*NL*
been
upon
the
point
of
instituting
a
revolt
against
the
bailiff
through
*NL*
impatience
to
hear
his
work
!
now
that
they
had
it
they
did
not
care
for
*NL*
it
.
This
same
representation
which
had
been
begun
amid
so
unanimous
an
*NL*
acclamation
!
Eternal
flood
and
ebb
of
popular
favor
!
To
think
that
they
*NL*
had
been
on
the
point
of
hanging
the
bailiff
's
sergeant
!
What
would
he
*NL*
not
have
given
to
be
still
at
that
hour
of
honey
!
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
usher
's
brutal
monologue
came
to
an
end
;
every
one
had
arrived
,
*NL*
and
Gringoire
breathed
freely
once
more
;
the
actors
continued
bravely
.
*NL*
But
Master
Coppenole
,
the
hosier
,
must
needs
rise
of
a
sudden
,
and
*NL*
Gringoire
was
forced
to
listen
to
him
deliver
,
amid
universal
attention
,
*NL*
the
following
abominable
harangue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Messieurs
the
bourgeois
and
squires
of
Paris
,
I
do
n't
know
,
cross
of
*NL*
God
!
what
we
are
doing
here
.
I
certainly
do
see
yonder
in
the
corner
on
*NL*
that
stage
,
some
people
who
appear
to
be
fighting
.
I
do
n't
know
whether
*NL*
that
is
what
you
call
a
``
mystery
,
''
but
it
is
not
amusing
;
they
quarrel
*NL*
with
their
tongues
and
nothing
more
.
I
have
been
waiting
for
the
first
*NL*
blow
this
quarter
of
an
hour
;
nothing
comes
;
they
are
cowards
who
only
*NL*
scratch
each
other
with
insults
.
You
ought
to
send
for
the
fighters
of
*NL*
London
or
Rotterdam
;
and
,
I
can
tell
you
!
you
would
have
had
blows
of
*NL*
the
fist
that
could
be
heard
in
the
Place
;
but
these
men
excite
our
*NL*
pity
.
They
ought
at
least
,
to
give
us
a
moorish
dance
,
or
some
other
*NL*
mummer
!
That
is
not
what
was
told
me
;
I
was
promised
a
feast
of
fools
,
*NL*
with
the
election
of
a
pope
.
We
have
our
pope
of
fools
at
Ghent
also
;
*NL*
we
're
not
behindhand
in
that
,
cross
of
God
!
But
this
is
the
way
we
*NL*
manage
it
;
we
collect
a
crowd
like
this
one
here
,
then
each
person
in
*NL*
turn
passes
his
head
through
a
hole
,
and
makes
a
grimace
at
the
rest
;
*NL*
time
one
who
makes
the
ugliest
,
is
elected
pope
by
general
acclamation
;
*NL*
that
's
the
way
it
is
.
It
is
very
diverting
.
Would
you
like
to
make
your
*NL*
pope
after
the
fashion
of
my
country
?
At
all
events
,
it
will
be
less
*NL*
wearisome
than
to
listen
to
chatterers
.
If
they
wish
to
come
and
make
*NL*
their
grimaces
through
the
hole
,
they
can
join
the
game
.
What
say
you
,
*NL*
Messieurs
les
bourgeois
?
You
have
here
enough
grotesque
specimens
of
*NL*
both
sexes
,
to
allow
of
laughing
in
Flemish
fashion
,
and
there
are
*NL*
enough
of
us
ugly
in
countenance
to
hope
for
a
fine
grinning
match
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gringoire
would
have
liked
to
retort
;
stupefaction
,
rage
,
indignation
,
*NL*
deprived
him
of
words
.
Moreover
,
the
suggestion
of
the
popular
hosier
*NL*
was
received
with
such
enthusiasm
by
these
bourgeois
who
were
flattered
*NL*
at
being
called
``
squires
,
''
that
all
resistance
was
useless
.
There
was
*NL*
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
allow
one
's
self
to
drift
with
the
torrent
.
*NL*
Gringoire
hid
his
face
between
his
two
hands
,
not
being
so
fortunate
*NL*
as
to
have
a
mantle
with
which
to
veil
his
head
,
like
Agamemnon
of
*NL*
Timantis
.

CHAPTER
V.
QUASIMODO
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
,
all
was
ready
to
execute
Coppenole
's
idea
.
*NL*
Bourgeois
,
scholars
and
law
clerks
all
set
to
work
.
The
little
chapel
*NL*
situated
opposite
the
marble
table
was
selected
for
the
scene
of
the
*NL*
grinning
match
.
A
pane
broken
in
the
pretty
rose
window
above
the
*NL*
door
,
left
free
a
circle
of
stone
through
which
it
was
agreed
that
the
*NL*
competitors
should
thrust
their
heads
.
In
order
to
reach
it
,
it
was
only
*NL*
necessary
to
mount
upon
a
couple
of
hogsheads
,
which
had
been
produced
*NL*
from
I
know
not
where
,
and
perched
one
upon
the
other
,
after
a
fashion
.
*NL*
It
was
settled
that
each
candidate
,
man
or
woman
-LRB-
for
it
was
possible
to
*NL*
choose
a
female
pope
-RRB-
,
should
,
for
the
sake
of
leaving
the
impression
of
*NL*
his
grimace
fresh
and
complete
,
cover
his
face
and
remain
concealed
in
*NL*
the
chapel
until
the
moment
of
his
appearance
.
In
less
than
an
instant
,
*NL*
the
chapel
was
crowded
with
competitors
,
upon
whom
the
door
was
then
*NL*
closed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Coppenole
,
from
his
post
,
ordered
all
,
directed
all
,
arranged
all
.
*NL*
During
the
uproar
,
the
cardinal
,
no
less
abashed
than
Gringoire
,
had
*NL*
retired
with
all
his
suite
,
under
the
pretext
of
business
and
vespers
,
*NL*
without
the
crowd
which
his
arrival
had
so
deeply
stirred
being
in
the
*NL*
least
moved
by
his
departure
.
Guillaume
Rym
was
the
only
one
who
noticed
*NL*
his
eminence
's
discomfiture
.
The
attention
of
the
populace
,
like
the
*NL*
sun
,
pursued
its
revolution
;
having
set
out
from
one
end
of
the
hall
,
*NL*
and
halted
for
a
space
in
the
middle
,
it
had
now
reached
the
other
end
.
*NL*
The
marble
table
,
the
brocaded
gallery
had
each
had
their
day
;
it
was
*NL*
now
the
turn
of
the
chapel
of
Louis
XI
.
Henceforth
,
the
field
was
open
*NL*
to
all
folly
.
There
was
no
one
there
now
,
but
the
Flemings
and
the
*NL*
rabble
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
grimaces
began
.
The
first
face
which
appeared
at
the
aperture
,
*NL*
with
eyelids
turned
up
to
the
reds
,
a
mouth
open
like
a
maw
,
and
a
*NL*
brow
wrinkled
like
our
hussar
boots
of
the
Empire
,
evoked
such
an
*NL*
inextinguishable
peal
of
laughter
that
Homer
would
have
taken
all
these
*NL*
louts
for
gods
.
Nevertheless
,
the
grand
hall
was
anything
but
Olympus
,
*NL*
and
Gringoire
's
poor
Jupiter
knew
it
better
than
any
one
else
.
A
second
*NL*
and
third
grimace
followed
,
then
another
and
another
;
and
the
laughter
*NL*
and
transports
of
delight
went
on
increasing
.
There
was
in
this
*NL*
spectacle
,
a
peculiar
power
of
intoxication
and
fascination
,
of
which
it
*NL*
would
be
difficult
to
convey
to
the
reader
of
our
day
and
our
salons
any
*NL*
idea
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
the
reader
picture
to
himself
a
series
of
visages
presenting
*NL*
successively
all
geometrical
forms
,
from
the
triangle
to
the
trapezium
,
*NL*
from
the
cone
to
the
polyhedron
;
all
human
expressions
,
from
wrath
*NL*
to
lewdness
;
all
ages
,
from
the
wrinkles
of
the
new-born
babe
to
the
*NL*
wrinkles
of
the
aged
and
dying
;
all
religious
phantasmagories
,
from
Faun
*NL*
to
Beelzebub
;
all
animal
profiles
,
from
the
maw
to
the
beak
,
from
the
*NL*
jowl
to
the
muzzle
.
Let
the
reader
imagine
all
these
grotesque
figures
*NL*
of
the
Pont
Neuf
,
those
nightmares
petrified
beneath
the
hand
of
Germain
*NL*
Pilon
,
assuming
life
and
breath
,
and
coming
in
turn
to
stare
you
in
the
*NL*
face
with
burning
eyes
;
all
the
masks
of
the
Carnival
of
Venice
passing
*NL*
in
succession
before
your
glass
,
--
in
a
word
,
a
human
kaleidoscope
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
orgy
grew
more
and
more
Flemish
.
Teniers
could
have
given
but
a
very
*NL*
imperfect
idea
of
it
.
Let
the
reader
picture
to
himself
in
bacchanal
*NL*
form
,
Salvator
Rosa
's
battle
.
There
were
no
longer
either
scholars
or
*NL*
ambassadors
or
bourgeois
or
men
or
women
;
there
was
no
longer
any
Clopin
*NL*
Trouillefou
,
nor
Gilles
Lecornu
,
nor
Marie
Quatrelivres
,
nor
Robin
*NL*
Poussepain
.
All
was
universal
license
.
The
grand
hall
was
no
longer
*NL*
anything
but
a
vast
furnace
of
effrontry
and
joviality
,
where
every
*NL*
mouth
was
a
cry
,
every
individual
a
posture
;
everything
shouted
and
*NL*
howled
.
The
strange
visages
which
came
,
in
turn
,
to
gnash
their
teeth
*NL*
in
the
rose
window
,
were
like
so
many
brands
cast
into
the
brazier
;
*NL*
and
from
the
whole
of
this
effervescing
crowd
,
there
escaped
,
as
from
a
*NL*
furnace
,
a
sharp
,
piercing
,
stinging
noise
,
hissing
like
the
wings
of
a
*NL*
gnat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ho
he
!
curse
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
look
at
that
face
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``

's
not
good
for
anything

*NL*
*NL*
``
Guillemette
Maugerepuis

the

``

``

Etc.

*NL*
*NL*
But
we
must
do
justice
to
our
friend
Jehan
.
In
the
midst
of
this
*NL*
witches
'
sabbath
,
he
was
still
to
be
seen
on
the
top
of
his
pillar
,
like
*NL*
the
cabin-boy
on
the
topmast
.
He
floundered
about
with
incredible
fury
.
*NL*
His
mouth
was
wide
open
,
and
from
it
there
escaped
a
cry
which
no
one
*NL*
heard
,
not
that
it
was
covered
by
the
general
clamor
,
great
as
that
*NL*
was
but
because
it
attained
,
no
doubt
,
the
limit
of
perceptible
sharp
*NL*
sounds
,
the
thousand
vibrations
of
Sauveur
,
or
the
eight
thousand
of
*NL*
Biot
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Gringoire
,
the
first
moment
of
depression
having
passed
,
he
*NL*
had
regained
his
composure
.
He
had
hardened
himself
against
*NL*
adversity
.
--
``
Continue
!
''
he
had
said
for
the
third
time
,
to
his
*NL*
comedians
,
speaking
machines
;
then
as
he
was
marching
with
great
strides
*NL*
in
front
of
the
marble
table
,
a
fancy
seized
him
to
go
and
appear
in
*NL*
his
turn
at
the
aperture
of
the
chapel
,
were
it
only
for
the
pleasure
of
*NL*
making
a
grimace
at
that
ungrateful
populace
.
--
``
But
no
,
that
would
*NL*
not
be
worthy
of
us
;
no
,
vengeance
!
let
us
combat
until
the
end
,
''
he
*NL*
repeated
to
himself
;
``
the
power
of
poetry
over
people
is
great
;
I
will
*NL*
bring
them
back
.
We
shall
see
which
will
carry
the
day
,
grimaces
or
*NL*
polite
literature
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alas
!
he
had
been
left
the
sole
spectator
of
his
piece
.
It
was
far
worse
*NL*
than
it
had
been
a
little
while
before
.
He
no
longer
beheld
anything
but
*NL*
backs
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
mistaken
.
The
big
,
patient
man
,
whom
he
had
already
consulted
in
a
*NL*
critical
moment
,
had
remained
with
his
face
turned
towards
the
stage
.
As
*NL*
for
Gisquette
and
Lienarde
,
they
had
deserted
him
long
ago
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gringoire
was
touched
to
the
heart
by
the
fidelity
of
his
only
*NL*
spectator
.
He
approached
him
and
addressed
him
,
shaking
his
arm
*NL*
slightly
;
for
the
good
man
was
leaning
on
the
balustrade
and
dozing
a
*NL*
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
''
said
Gringoire
,
``
I
thank
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
''
replied
the
big
man
with
a
yawn
,
``
for
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
what
wearies
you
,
''
resumed
the
poet
;
''
't
is
all
this
noise
which
*NL*
prevents
your
hearing
comfortably
.
But
be
at
ease
!
your
name
shall
*NL*
descend
to
posterity
!
Your
name
,
if
you
please
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Renauld
Chateau
,
guardian
of
the
seals
of
the
Chatelet
of
Paris
,
at
*NL*
your
service
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
you
are
the
only
representative
of
the
muses
here
,
''
said
*NL*
Gringoire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
too
kind
,
sir
,
''
said
the
guardian
of
the
seals
at
the
Chatelet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
the
only
one
,
''
resumed
Gringoire
,
``
who
has
listened
to
the
*NL*
piece
decorously
.
What
do
you
think
of
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
!
he
!
''
replied
the
fat
magistrate
,
half
aroused
,
``
it
's
tolerably
*NL*
jolly
,
that
's
a
fact
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gringoire
was
forced
to
content
himself
with
this
eulogy
;
for
a
*NL*
thunder
of
applause
,
mingled
with
a
prodigious
acclamation
,
cut
their
*NL*
conversation
short
.
The
Pope
of
the
Fools
had
been
elected
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Noel
!
Noel
!
Noel
!
''
*
shouted
the
people
on
all
sides
.
That
was
,
in
*NL*
fact
,
a
marvellous
grimace
which
was
beaming
at
that
moment
through
the
*NL*
aperture
in
the
rose
window
.
After
all
the
pentagonal
,
hexagonal
,
and
*NL*
whimsical
faces
,
which
had
succeeded
each
other
at
that
hole
without
*NL*
realizing
the
ideal
of
the
grotesque
which
their
imaginations
,
excited
*NL*
by
the
orgy
,
had
constructed
,
nothing
less
was
needed
to
win
their
*NL*
suffrages
than
the
sublime
grimace
which
had
just
dazzled
the
assembly
.
*NL*
Master
Coppenole
himself
applauded
,
and
Clopin
Trouillefou
,
who
had
*NL*
been
among
the
competitors
-LRB-
and
God
knows
what
intensity
of
ugliness
his
*NL*
visage
could
attain
-RRB-
,
confessed
himself
conquered
:
We
will
do
the
same
.
*NL*
We
shall
not
try
to
give
the
reader
an
idea
of
that
tetrahedral
nose
,
*NL*
that
horseshoe
mouth
;
that
little
left
eye
obstructed
with
a
red
,
bushy
,
*NL*
bristling
eyebrow
,
while
the
right
eye
disappeared
entirely
beneath
an
*NL*
enormous
wart
;
of
those
teeth
in
disarray
,
broken
here
and
there
,
like
*NL*
the
embattled
parapet
of
a
fortress
;
of
that
callous
lip
,
upon
which
one
*NL*
of
these
teeth
encroached
,
like
the
tusk
of
an
elephant
;
of
that
forked
*NL*
chin
;
and
above
all
,
of
the
expression
spread
over
the
whole
;
of
that
*NL*
mixture
of
malice
,
amazement
,
and
sadness
.
Let
the
reader
dream
of
this
*NL*
whole
,
if
he
can
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
The
ancient
French
hurrah
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
acclamation
was
unanimous
;
people
rushed
towards
the
chapel
.
They
*NL*
made
the
lucky
Pope
of
the
Fools
come
forth
in
triumph
.
But
it
was
then
*NL*
that
surprise
and
admiration
attained
their
highest
pitch
;
the
grimace
*NL*
was
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Or
rather
,
his
whole
person
was
a
grimace
.
A
huge
head
,
bristling
*NL*
with
red
hair
;
between
his
shoulders
an
enormous
hump
,
a
counterpart
*NL*
perceptible
in
front
;
a
system
of
thighs
and
legs
so
strangely
astray
*NL*
that
they
could
touch
each
other
only
at
the
knees
,
and
,
viewed
from
*NL*
the
front
,
resembled
the
crescents
of
two
scythes
joined
by
the
*NL*
handles
;
large
feet
,
monstrous
hands
;
and
,
with
all
this
deformity
,
*NL*
an
indescribable
and
redoubtable
air
of
vigor
,
agility
,
and
*NL*
courage
,
--
strange
exception
to
the
eternal
rule
which
wills
that
force
*NL*
as
well
as
beauty
shall
be
the
result
of
harmony
.
Such
was
the
pope
whom
*NL*
the
fools
had
just
chosen
for
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
would
have
pronounced
him
a
giant
who
had
been
broken
and
badly
put
*NL*
together
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
this
species
of
cyclops
appeared
on
the
threshold
of
the
chapel
,
*NL*
motionless
,
squat
,
and
almost
as
broad
as
he
was
tall
;
squared
on
the
*NL*
base
,
as
a
great
man
says
;
with
his
doublet
half
red
,
half
violet
,
sown
*NL*
with
silver
bells
,
and
,
above
all
,
in
the
perfection
of
his
ugliness
,
*NL*
the
populace
recognized
him
on
the
instant
,
and
shouted
with
one
*NL*
voice
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
Quasimodo
,
the
bellringer
!
't
is
Quasimodo
,

hunchback

*NL*
Noel
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
will
be
seen
that
the
poor
fellow
had
a
choice
of
surnames
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
the
women
with
child
beware
!
''
shouted
the
scholars
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
those
who
wish
to
be

''
resumed
Joannes
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
women
did
,
in
fact
,
hide
their
faces
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
the
horrible
monkey
!
''
said
one
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
wicked
as
he
is
ugly

''
retorted
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
the
devil

''
added
a
third
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
the
misfortune
to
live
near
Notre-Dame

I
hear
him
prowling
*NL*
round
the
eaves
by

*NL*
*NL*
``
With

cats

``

roofs

``

throws

down
our
chimneys

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
other
evening
,
he
came
and
made
a
grimace
at
me
through
my
attic
*NL*
window
.
I
thought
that
it
was
a
man

Such
a
fright
as
I
had
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
that

goes

Once

left

``

*NL*
``
Whew

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
men
,
on
the
contrary
,
were
delighted
and
applauded
.
Quasimodo
,
the
*NL*
object
of
the
tumult
,
still
stood
on
the
threshold
of
the
chapel
,
sombre
*NL*
and
grave
,
and
allowed
them
to
admire
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
scholar
-LRB-
Robin
Poussepain
,
I
think
-RRB-
,
came
and
laughed
in
his
face
,
*NL*
and
too
close
.
Quasimodo
contented
himself
with
taking
him
by
the
*NL*
girdle
,
and
hurling
him
ten
paces
off
amid
the
crowd
;
all
without
*NL*
uttering
a
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
Master
Coppenole
,
in
amazement
,
approached
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cross
of
God
!
Holy
Father
!
you
possess
the
handsomest
ugliness
that
I
*NL*
have
ever
beheld
in
my
life
.
You
would
deserve
to
be
pope
at
Rome
,
as
*NL*
well
as
at
Paris
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
he
placed
his
hand
gayly
on
his
shoulder
.
Quasimodo
did
not
*NL*
stir
.
Coppenole
went
on
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
rogue
with
whom
I
have
a
fancy
for
carousing
,
were
it
to
cost
*NL*
me
a
new
dozen
of
twelve
livres
of
Tours
.
How
does
it
strike
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Quasimodo
made
no
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cross
of
God
!
''
said
the
hosier
,
``
are
you
deaf
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
,
in
truth
,
deaf
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
he
began
to
grow
impatient
with
Coppenole
's
behavior
,
and
*NL*
suddenly
turned
towards
him
with
so
formidable
a
gnashing
of
teeth
,
that
*NL*
the
Flemish
giant
recoiled
,
like
a
bull-dog
before
a
cat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
there
was
created
around
that
strange
personage
,
a
circle
of
terror
*NL*
and
respect
,
whose
radius
was
at
least
fifteen
geometrical
feet
.
An
old
*NL*
woman
explained
to
Coppenole
that
Quasimodo
was
deaf
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Deaf
!
''
said
the
hosier
,
with
his
great
Flemish
laugh
.
``
Cross
of
God
!
*NL*
He
's
a
perfect
pope
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
!
I
recognize
him
,
''
exclaimed
Jehan
,
who
had
,
at
last
,
descended
from
*NL*
his
capital
,
in
order
to
see
Quasimodo
at
closer
quarters
,
``
he
's
the
*NL*
bellringer
of
my
brother
,
the
archdeacon
.
Good-day
,
Quasimodo
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
devil
of
a
man
!
''
said
Robin
Poussepain
still
all
bruised
*NL*
with
his
fall
.
``
He
shows
himself
;
he
's
a
hunchback
.
He
walks
;
he
's
*NL*
bandy-legged
.
He
looks
at
you
;
he
's
one-eyed
.
You
speak
to
him
;
he
's
*NL*
deaf
.
And
what
does
this
Polyphemus
do
with
his
tongue
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
speaks
when
he
chooses
,
''
said
the
old
woman
;
``
he
became
deaf
through
*NL*
ringing
the
bells
.
He
is
not
dumb
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
he
lacks
,
''
remarks
Jehan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
he
has
one
eye
too
many
,
''
added
Robin
Poussepain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
,
''
said
Jehan
wisely
.
``
A
one-eyed
man
is
far
less
complete
*NL*
than
a
blind
man
.
He
knows
what
he
lacks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
all
the
beggars
,
all
the
lackeys
,
all
the
cutpurses
,
*NL*
joined
with
the
scholars
,
had
gone
in
procession
to
seek
,
in
the
*NL*
cupboard
of
the
law
clerks
'
company
,
the
cardboard
tiara
,
and
the
*NL*
derisive
robe
of
the
Pope
of
the
Fools
.
Quasimodo
allowed
them
to
array
*NL*
him
in
them
without
wincing
,
and
with
a
sort
of
proud
docility
.
Then
*NL*
they
made
him
seat
himself
on
a
motley
litter
.
Twelve
officers
of
the
*NL*
fraternity
of
fools
raised
him
on
their
shoulders
;
and
a
sort
of
bitter
*NL*
and
disdainful
joy
lighted
up
the
morose
face
of
the
cyclops
,
when
he
*NL*
beheld
beneath
his
deformed
feet
all
those
heads
of
handsome
,
straight
,
*NL*
well-made
men
.
Then
the
ragged
and
howling
procession
set
out
on
its
*NL*
march
,
according
to
custom
,
around
the
inner
galleries
of
the
Courts
,
*NL*
before
making
the
circuit
of
the
streets
and
squares

CHAPTER
VI
.
ESMERALDA
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
We
are
delighted
to
be
able
to
inform
the
reader
,
that
during
the
whole
*NL*
of
this
scene
,
Gringoire
and
his
piece
had
stood
firm
.
His
actors
,
*NL*
spurred
on
by
him
,
had
not
ceased
to
spout
his
comedy
,
and
he
had
not
*NL*
ceased
to
listen
to
it
.
He
had
made
up
his
mind
about
the
tumult
,
and
*NL*
was
determined
to
proceed
to
the
end
,
not
giving
up
the
hope
of
a
return
*NL*
of
attention
on
the
part
of
the
public
.
This
gleam
of
hope
acquired
*NL*
fresh
life
,
when
he
saw
Quasimodo
,
Coppenole
,
and
the
deafening
escort
*NL*
of
the
pope
of
the
procession
of
fools
quit
the
hall
amid
great
uproar
.
*NL*
The
throng
rushed
eagerly
after
them
.
``
Good
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
there
*NL*
go
all
the
mischief-makers
.
''
Unfortunately
,
all
the
mischief-makers
*NL*
constituted
the
entire
audience
.
In
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
,
the
grand
*NL*
hall
was
empty
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
tell
the
truth
,
a
few
spectators
still
remained
,
some
scattered
,
*NL*
others
in
groups
around
the
pillars
,
women
,
old
men
,
or
children
,
*NL*
who
had
had
enough
of
the
uproar
and
tumult
.
Some
scholars
were
still
*NL*
perched
astride
of
the
window-sills
,
engaged
in
gazing
into
the
Place
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
thought
Gringoire
,
``
here
are
still
as
many
as
are
required
to
*NL*
hear
the
end
of
my
mystery
.
They
are
few
in
number
,
but
it
is
a
choice
*NL*
audience
,
a
lettered
audience
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
An
instant
later
,
a
symphony
which
had
been
intended
to
produce
the
*NL*
greatest
effect
on
the
arrival
of
the
Virgin
,
was
lacking
.
Gringoire
*NL*
perceived
that
his
music
had
been
carried
off
by
the
procession
of
the
*NL*
Pope
of
the
Fools
.
``
Skip
it
,
''
said
he
,
stoically
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
approached
a
group
of
bourgeois
,
who
seemed
to
him
to
be
discussing
*NL*
his
piece
.
This
is
the
fragment
of
conversation
which
he
caught
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
,
Master
Cheneteau
,
the
Hotel
de
Navarre
,
which
belonged
to
*NL*
Monsieur
de
Nemours
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
opposite
the
Chapelle
de
Braque
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
the
treasury
has
just
let
it
to
Guillaume
Alixandre
,
historian
,
*NL*
for
six
hivres
,
eight
sols
,
parisian
,
a
year
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
rents
are
going
up
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
''
said
Gringoire
to
himself
,
with
a
sigh
,
``
the
others
are
*NL*
listening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Comrades
,
''
suddenly
shouted
one
of
the
young
scamps
from
the
window
,
*NL*
``
La
Esmeralda
!
La
Esmeralda
in
the
Place
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
word
produced
a
magical
effect
.
Every
one
who
was
left
in
the
hall
*NL*
flew
to
the
windows
,
climbing
the
walls
in
order
to
see
,
and
repeating
,
*NL*
``
La
Esmeralda
!
La
Esmeralda
?
''
At
the
same
time
,
a
great
sound
of
*NL*
applause
was
heard
from
without
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
meaning
of
this
,
of
the
Esmeralda
?
''
said
Gringoire
,
wringing
*NL*
his
hands
in
despair
.
``
Ah
,
good
heavens
!
it
seems
to
be
the
turn
of
the
*NL*
windows
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
returned
towards
the
marble
table
,
and
saw
that
the
representation
*NL*
had
been
interrupted
.
It
was
precisely
at
the
instant
when
Jupiter
*NL*
should
have
appeared
with
his
thunder
.
But
Jupiter
was
standing
*NL*
motionless
at
the
foot
of
the
stage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Michel
Giborne
!
''
cried
the
irritated
poet
,
``
what
are
you
doing
there
?
*NL*
Is
that
your
part
?
Come
up
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
!
''
said
Jupiter
,
``
a
scholar
has
just
seized
the
ladder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gringoire
looked
.
It
was
but
too
true
.
All
communication
between
his
*NL*
plot
and
its
solution
was
intercepted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
rascal
,
''
he
murmured
.
``
And
why
did
he
take
that
ladder
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
order
to
go
and
see
the
Esmeralda
,
''
replied
Jupiter
piteously
.
``
He
*NL*
said
,
`
Come
,
here
's
a
ladder
that
's
of
no
use
!
'
and
he
took
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
last
blow
.
Gringoire
received
it
with
resignation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
the
devil
fly
away
with
you
!
''
he
said
to
the
comedian
,
``
and
if
I
*NL*
get
my
pay
,
you
shall
receive
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
beat
a
retreat
,
with
drooping
head
,
but
the
last
in
the
field
,
*NL*
like
a
general
who
has
fought
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
as
he
descended
the
winding
stairs
of
the
courts
:
``
A
fine
rabble
of
*NL*
asses
and
dolts
these
Parisians
!
''
he
muttered
between
his
teeth
;
``
they
*NL*
come
to
hear
a
mystery
and
do
n't
listen
to
it
at
all

They
are

by

not

If

I

have
given

And
I

behold
only
backs

to
be
a
poet

reap
the

success

an
apothecary

It
is
true
that
Homerus
begged
through
the

Greek
towns

and
that
Naso
died
in
exile

Muscovites

But
may
*NL*
the

flay
me

CHAPTER
I.
FROM
CHARYBDIS
TO
SCYLLA
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Night
comes
on
early
in
January
.
The
streets
were
already
dark
when
*NL*
Gringoire
issued
forth
from
the
Courts
.
This
gloom
pleased
him
;
he
was
*NL*
in
haste
to
reach
some
obscure
and
deserted
alley
,
in
order
there
to
*NL*
meditate
at
his
ease
,
and
in
order
that
the
philosopher
might
place
the
*NL*
first
dressing
upon
the
wound
of
the
poet
.
Philosophy
,
moreover
,
was
his
*NL*
sole
refuge
,
for
he
did
not
know
where
he
was
to
lodge
for
the
night
.
*NL*
After
the
brilliant
failure
of
his
first
theatrical
venture
,
he
*NL*
dared
not
return
to
the
lodging
which
he
occupied
in
the
Rue
*NL*
Grenier-sur-l'Eau
,
opposite
to
the
Port-au-Foin
,
having
depended
*NL*
upon
receiving
from
monsieur
the
provost
for
his
epithalamium
,
the
*NL*
wherewithal
to
pay
Master
Guillaume
Doulx-Sire
,
farmer
of
the
taxes
on
*NL*
cloven-footed
animals
in
Paris
,
the
rent
which
he
owed
him
,
that
is
*NL*
to
say
,
twelve
sols
parisian
;
twelve
times
the
value
of
all
that
he
*NL*
possessed
in
the
world
,
including
his
trunk-hose
,
his
shirt
,
and
his
*NL*
cap
.
After
reflecting
a
moment
,
temporarily
sheltered
beneath
the
little
*NL*
wicket
of
the
prison
of
the
treasurer
of
the
Sainte-Chappelle
,
as
to
the
*NL*
shelter
which
he
would
select
for
the
night
,
having
all
the
pavements
of
*NL*
Paris
to
choose
from
,
he
remembered
to
have
noticed
the
week
previously
*NL*
in
the
Rue
de
la
Savaterie
,
at
the
door
of
a
councillor
of
the
*NL*
parliament
,
a
stepping
stone
for
mounting
a
mule
,
and
to
have
said
to
*NL*
himself
that
that
stone
would
furnish
,
on
occasion
,
a
very
excellent
*NL*
pillow
for
a
mendicant
or
a
poet
.
He
thanked
Providence
for
having
sent
*NL*
this
happy
idea
to
him
;
but
,
as
he
was
preparing
to
cross
the
Place
,
*NL*
in
order
to
reach
the
tortuous
labyrinth
of
the
city
,
where
meander
*NL*
all
those
old
sister
streets
,
the
Rues
de
la
Barillerie
,
de
la
*NL*
Vielle-Draperie
,
de
la
Savaterie
,
de
la
Juiverie
,
etc.
,
still
extant
*NL*
to-day
,
with
their
nine-story
houses
,
he
saw
the
procession
of
the
Pope
*NL*
of
the
Fools
,
which
was
also
emerging
from
the
court
house
,
and
rushing
*NL*
across
the
courtyard
,
with
great
cries
,
a
great
flashing
of
torches
,
and
*NL*
the
music
which
belonged
to
him
,
Gringoire
.
This
sight
revived
the
*NL*
pain
of
his
self-love
;
he
fled
.
In
the
bitterness
of
his
dramatic
*NL*
misadventure
,
everything
which
reminded
him
of
the
festival
of
that
day
*NL*
irritated
his
wound
and
made
it
bleed
.
*NL*
*NL*
58
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
on
the
point
of
turning
to
the
Pont
Saint-Michel
;
children
were
*NL*
running
about
here
and
there
with
fire
lances
and
rockets
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pest
on
firework
candles
!
''
said
Gringoire
;
and
he
fell
back
on
the
Pont
*NL*
au
Change
.
To
the
house
at
the
head
of
the
bridge
there
had
been
affixed
*NL*
three
small
banners
,
representing
the
king
,
the
dauphin
,
and
Marguerite
*NL*
of
Flanders
,
and
six
little
pennons
on
which
were
portrayed
the
Duke
of
*NL*
Austria
,
the
Cardinal
de
Bourbon
,
M.
de
Beaujeu
,
and
Madame
Jeanne
de
*NL*
France
,
and
Monsieur
the
Bastard
of
Bourbon
,
and
I
know
not
whom
else
;
*NL*
all
being
illuminated
with
torches
.
The
rabble
were
admiring
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Happy
painter
,
Jehan
Fourbault
!
''
said
Gringoire
with
a
deep
sigh
;
*NL*
and
he
turned
his
back
upon
the
bannerets
and
pennons
.
A
street
opened
*NL*
before
him
;
he
thought
it
so
dark
and
deserted
that
he
hoped
to
there
*NL*
escape
from
all
the
rumors
as
well
as
from
all
the
gleams
of
the
*NL*
festival
.
At
the
end
of
a
few
moments
his
foot
came
in
contact
with
an
*NL*
obstacle
;
he
stumbled
and
fell
.
It
was
the
May
truss
,
which
the
clerks
*NL*
of
the
clerks
'
law
court
had
deposited
that
morning
at
the
door
of
*NL*
a
president
of
the
parliament
,
in
honor
of
the
solemnity
of
the
day
.
*NL*
Gringoire
bore
this
new
disaster
heroically
;
he
picked
himself
up
,
and
*NL*
reached
the
water
's
edge
.
After
leaving
behind
him
the
civic
Tournelle
*
*NL*
and
the
criminal
tower
,
and
skirted
the
great
walls
of
the
king
's
*NL*
garden
,
on
that
unpaved
strand
where
the
mud
reached
to
his
ankles
,
he
*NL*
reached
the
western
point
of
the
city
,
and
considered
for
some
time
*NL*
the
islet
of
the
Passeur-aux-Vaches
,
which
has
disappeared
beneath
the
*NL*
bronze
horse
of
the
Pont
Neuf
.
The
islet
appeared
to
him
in
the
shadow
*NL*
like
a
black
mass
,
beyond
the
narrow
strip
of
whitish
water
which
*NL*
separated
him
from
it
.
One
could
divine
by
the
ray
of
a
tiny
light
the
*NL*
sort
of
hut
in
the
form
of
a
beehive
where
the
ferryman
of
cows
took
*NL*
refuge
at
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
A
chamber
of
the
ancient
parliament
of
Paris
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Happy
ferryman
!
''
thought
Gringoire
;
``
you
do
not
dream
of
glory
,
and
*NL*
you
do
not
make
marriage
songs
!
What
matters
it
to
you
,
if
kings
and
*NL*
Duchesses
of
Burgundy
marry
?
You
know
no
other
daisies
-LRB-
_
marguerites
_
-RRB-
*NL*
than
those
which
your
April
greensward
gives
your
cows
to
browse
upon
;
*NL*
while
I
,
a
poet
,
am
hooted
,
and
shiver
,
and
owe
twelve
sous
,
and
the
*NL*
soles
of
my
shoes
are
so
transparent
,
that
they
might
serve
as
glasses
*NL*
for
your
lantern
!
Thanks
,
ferryman
,
your
cabin
rests
my
eyes
,
and
makes
*NL*
me
forget
Paris
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
roused
from
his
almost
lyric
ecstacy
,
by
a
big
double
Saint-Jean
*NL*
cracker
,
which
suddenly
went
off
from
the
happy
cabin
.
It
was
the
cow
*NL*
ferryman
,
who
was
taking
his
part
in
the
rejoicings
of
the
day
,
and
*NL*
letting
off
fireworks
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
cracker
made
Gringoire
's
skin
bristle
up
all
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Accursed
festival
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
``
wilt
thou
pursue
me
everywhere
?
Oh
!
*NL*
good
God
!
even
to
the
ferryman
's
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
looked
at
the
Seine
at
his
feet
,
and
a
horrible
temptation
took
*NL*
possession
of
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
said
he
,
``
I
would
gladly
drown
myself
,
were
the
water
not
so
*NL*
cold
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
a
desperate
resolution
occurred
to
him
.
It
was
,
since
he
could
not
*NL*
escape
from
the
Pope
of
the
Fools
,
from
Jehan
Fourbault
's
bannerets
,
*NL*
from
May
trusses
,
from
squibs
and
crackers
,
to
go
to
the
Place
de
Greve
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
least
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
I
shall
there
have
a
firebrand
of
joy
*NL*
wherewith
to
warm
myself
,
and
I
can
sup
on
some
crumbs
of
the
three
*NL*
great
armorial
bearings
of
royal
sugar
which
have
been
erected
on
the
*NL*
public
refreshment-stall
of
the
city

CHAPTER
II
.
THE
PLACE
DE
GREVE
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
There
remains
to-day
but
a
very
imperceptible
vestige
of
the
Place
*NL*
de
Greve
,
such
as
it
existed
then
;
it
consists
in
the
charming
little
*NL*
turret
,
which
occupies
the
angle
north
of
the
Place
,
and
which
,
already
*NL*
enshrouded
in
the
ignoble
plaster
which
fills
with
paste
the
delicate
*NL*
lines
of
its
sculpture
,
would
soon
have
disappeared
,
perhaps
submerged
*NL*
by
that
flood
of
new
houses
which
so
rapidly
devours
all
the
ancient
*NL*
facades
of
Paris
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
persons
who
,
like
ourselves
,
never
cross
the
Place
de
Greve
without
*NL*
casting
a
glance
of
pity
and
sympathy
on
that
poor
turret
strangled
*NL*
between
two
hovels
of
the
time
of
Louis
XV.
,
can
easily
reconstruct
in
*NL*
their
minds
the
aggregate
of
edifices
to
which
it
belonged
,
and
find
*NL*
again
entire
in
it
the
ancient
Gothic
place
of
the
fifteenth
century
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
then
,
as
it
is
to-day
,
an
irregular
trapezoid
,
bordered
on
one
*NL*
side
by
the
quay
,
and
on
the
other
three
by
a
series
of
lofty
,
narrow
,
*NL*
and
gloomy
houses
.
By
day
,
one
could
admire
the
variety
of
its
edifices
,
*NL*
all
sculptured
in
stone
or
wood
,
and
already
presenting
complete
*NL*
specimens
of
the
different
domestic
architectures
of
the
Middle
Ages
,
*NL*
running
back
from
the
fifteenth
to
the
eleventh
century
,
from
the
*NL*
casement
which
had
begun
to
dethrone
the
arch
,
to
the
Roman
semicircle
,
*NL*
which
had
been
supplanted
by
the
ogive
,
and
which
still
occupies
,
below
*NL*
it
,
the
first
story
of
that
ancient
house
de
la
Tour
Roland
,
at
the
*NL*
corner
of
the
Place
upon
the
Seine
,
on
the
side
of
the
street
with
the
*NL*
Tannerie
.
At
night
,
one
could
distinguish
nothing
of
all
that
mass
of
*NL*
buildings
,
except
the
black
indentation
of
the
roofs
,
unrolling
*NL*
their
chain
of
acute
angles
round
the
place
;
for
one
of
the
radical
*NL*
differences
between
the
cities
of
that
time
,
and
the
cities
of
the
*NL*
present
day
,
lay
in
the
facades
which
looked
upon
the
places
and
*NL*
streets
,
and
which
were
then
gables
.
For
the
last
two
centuries
the
*NL*
houses
have
been
turned
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
centre
of
the
eastern
side
of
the
Place
,
rose
a
heavy
and
hybrid
*NL*
construction
,
formed
of
three
buildings
placed
in
juxtaposition
.
It
was
*NL*
called
by
three
names
which
explain
its
history
,
its
destination
,
and
*NL*
its
architecture
:
``
The
House
of
the
Dauphin
,
''
because
Charles
V.
,
when
*NL*
Dauphin
,
had
inhabited
it
;
``
The
Marchandise
,
''
because
it
had
served
as
*NL*
town
hall
;
and
``
The
Pillared
House
''
-LRB-
_
domus
ad
piloria
_
-RRB-
,
because
of
*NL*
a
series
of
large
pillars
which
sustained
the
three
stories
.
The
city
*NL*
found
there
all
that
is
required
for
a
city
like
Paris
;
a
chapel
in
*NL*
which
to
pray
to
God
;
a
_
plaidoyer
_
,
or
pleading
room
,
in
which
to
hold
*NL*
hearings
,
and
to
repel
,
at
need
,
the
King
's
people
;
and
under
the
roof
,
*NL*
an
_
arsenac
_
full
of
artillery
.
For
the
bourgeois
of
Paris
were
aware
*NL*
that
it
is
not
sufficient
to
pray
in
every
conjuncture
,
and
to
plead
*NL*
for
the
franchises
of
the
city
,
and
they
had
always
in
reserve
,
in
the
*NL*
garret
of
the
town
hall
,
a
few
good
rusty
arquebuses
.
The
Greve
had
then
*NL*
that
sinister
aspect
which
it
preserves
to-day
from
the
execrable
ideas
*NL*
which
it
awakens
,
and
from
the
sombre
town
hall
of
Dominique
Bocador
,
*NL*
which
has
replaced
the
Pillared
House
.
It
must
be
admitted
that
a
*NL*
permanent
gibbet
and
a
pillory
,
``
a
justice
and
a
ladder
,
''
as
they
were
*NL*
called
in
that
day
,
erected
side
by
side
in
the
centre
of
the
pavement
,
*NL*
contributed
not
a
little
to
cause
eyes
to
be
turned
away
from
that
*NL*
fatal
place
,
where
so
many
beings
full
of
life
and
health
have
agonized
;
*NL*
where
,
fifty
years
later
,
that
fever
of
Saint
Vallier
was
destined
to
*NL*
have
its
birth
,
that
terror
of
the
scaffold
,
the
most
monstrous
of
all
*NL*
maladies
because
it
comes
not
from
God
,
but
from
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
a
consoling
idea
-LRB-
let
us
remark
in
passing
-RRB-
,
to
think
that
the
*NL*
death
penalty
,
which
three
hundred
years
ago
still
encumbered
with
its
*NL*
iron
wheels
,
its
stone
gibbets
,
and
all
its
paraphernalia
of
torture
,
*NL*
permanent
and
riveted
to
the
pavement
,
the
Greve
,
the
Halles
,
the
Place
*NL*
Dauphine
,
the
Cross
du
Trahoir
,
the
Marche
aux
Pourceaux
,
that
hideous
*NL*
Montfaucon
,
the
barrier
des
Sergents
,
the
Place
aux
Chats
,
the
Porte
*NL*
Saint-Denis
,
Champeaux
,
the
Porte
Baudets
,
the
Porte
Saint
Jacques
,
*NL*
without
reckoning
the
innumerable
ladders
of
the
provosts
,
the
bishop
of
*NL*
the
chapters
,
of
the
abbots
,
of
the
priors
,
who
had
the
decree
of
life
*NL*
and
death
,
--
without
reckoning
the
judicial
drownings
in
the
river
Seine
;
*NL*
it
is
consoling
to-day
,
after
having
lost
successively
all
the
pieces
of
*NL*
its
armor
,
its
luxury
of
torment
,
its
penalty
of
imagination
and
fancy
,
*NL*
its
torture
for
which
it
reconstructed
every
five
years
a
leather
bed
*NL*
at
the
Grand
Chatelet
,
that
ancient
suzerain
of
feudal
society
almost
*NL*
expunged
from
our
laws
and
our
cities
,
hunted
from
code
to
code
,
chased
*NL*
from
place
to
place
,
has
no
longer
,
in
our
immense
Paris
,
any
more
than
*NL*
a
dishonored
corner
of
the
Greve
,
--
than
a
miserable
guillotine
,
furtive
,
*NL*
uneasy
,
shameful
,
which
seems
always
afraid
of
being
caught
in
the
act
,
*NL*
so
quickly
does
it
disappear
after
having
dealt
its
blow
.

KISSES
FOR
BLOWS
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Pierre
Gringoire
arrived
on
the
Place
de
Greve
,
he
was
paralyzed
.
*NL*
He
had
directed
his
course
across
the
Pont
aux
Meuniers
,
in
order
*NL*
to
avoid
the
rabble
on
the
Pont
au
Change
,
and
the
pennons
of
Jehan
*NL*
Fourbault
;
but
the
wheels
of
all
the
bishop
's
mills
had
splashed
him
as
*NL*
he
passed
,
and
his
doublet
was
drenched
;
it
seemed
to
him
besides
,
that
*NL*
the
failure
of
his
piece
had
rendered
him
still
more
sensible
to
cold
*NL*
than
usual
.
Hence
he
made
haste
to
draw
near
the
bonfire
,
which
was
*NL*
burning
magnificently
in
the
middle
of
the
Place
.
But
a
considerable
*NL*
crowd
formed
a
circle
around
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Accursed
Parisians
!
''
he
said
to
himself
-LRB-
for
Gringoire
,
like
a
true
*NL*
dramatic
poet
,
was
subject
to
monologues
-RRB-
``
there
they
are
obstructing
my
*NL*
fire
!
Nevertheless
,
I
am
greatly
in
need
of
a
chimney
corner
;
my
shoes
*NL*
drink
in
the
water
,
and
all
those
cursed
mills
wept
upon
me
!
That
devil
*NL*
of
a
Bishop
of
Paris
,
with
his
mills
!
I
'd
just
like
to
know
what
use
a
*NL*
bishop
can
make
of
a
mill
!
Does
he
expect
to
become
a
miller
instead
of
*NL*
a
bishop
?
If
only
my
malediction
is
needed
for
that
,
I
bestow
it
upon
*NL*
him
!
and
his
cathedral
,
and
his
mills
!
Just
see
if
those
boobies
will
*NL*
put
themselves
out
!
Move
aside
!
I
'd
like
to
know
what
they
are
doing
*NL*
there
!
They
are
warming
themselves
,
much
pleasure
may
it
give
them
!
They
*NL*
are
watching
a
hundred
fagots
burn
;
a
fine
spectacle
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
looking
more
closely
,
he
perceived
that
the
circle
was
much
larger
*NL*
than
was
required
simply
for
the
purpose
of
getting
warm
at
the
king
's
*NL*
fire
,
and
that
this
concourse
of
people
had
not
been
attracted
solely
by
*NL*
the
beauty
of
the
hundred
fagots
which
were
burning
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
vast
space
left
free
between
the
crowd
and
the
fire
,
a
young
girl
*NL*
was
dancing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
this
young
girl
was
a
human
being
,
a
fairy
,
or
an
angel
,
is
what
*NL*
Gringoire
,
sceptical
philosopher
and
ironical
poet
that
he
was
,
could
*NL*
not
decide
at
the
first
moment
,
so
fascinated
was
he
by
this
dazzling
*NL*
vision
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
not
tall
,
though
she
seemed
so
,
so
boldly
did
her
slender
form
*NL*
dart
about
.
She
was
swarthy
of
complexion
,
but
one
divined
that
,
by
day
,
*NL*
her
skin
must
possess
that
beautiful
golden
tone
of
the
Andalusians
and
*NL*
the
Roman
women
.
Her
little
foot
,
too
,
was
Andalusian
,
for
it
was
both
*NL*
pinched
and
at
ease
in
its
graceful
shoe
.
She
danced
,
she
turned
,
she
*NL*
whirled
rapidly
about
on
an
old
Persian
rug
,
spread
negligently
under
*NL*
her
feet
;
and
each
time
that
her
radiant
face
passed
before
you
,
as
she
*NL*
whirled
,
her
great
black
eyes
darted
a
flash
of
lightning
at
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
around
her
,
all
glances
were
riveted
,
all
mouths
open
;
and
,
in
fact
,
*NL*
when
she
danced
thus
,
to
the
humming
of
the
Basque
tambourine
,
which
*NL*
her
two
pure
,
rounded
arms
raised
above
her
head
,
slender
,
frail
and
*NL*
vivacious
as
a
wasp
,
with
her
corsage
of
gold
without
a
fold
,
her
*NL*
variegated
gown
puffing
out
,
her
bare
shoulders
,
her
delicate
limbs
,
*NL*
which
her
petticoat
revealed
at
times
,
her
black
hair
,
her
eyes
of
*NL*
flame
,
she
was
a
supernatural
creature
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
truth
,
''
said
Gringoire
to
himself
,
``
she
is
a
salamander
,
she
is
a
*NL*
nymph
,
she
is
a
goddess
,
she
is
a
bacchante
of
the
Menelean
Mount
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
,
one
of
the
salamander
's
braids
of
hair
became
*NL*
unfastened
,
and
a
piece
of
yellow
copper
which
was
attached
to
it
,
*NL*
rolled
to
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
,
no
!
''
said
he
,
``
she
is
a
gypsy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
illusions
had
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
began
her
dance
once
more
;
she
took
from
the
ground
two
swords
,
*NL*
whose
points
she
rested
against
her
brow
,
and
which
she
made
to
turn
*NL*
in
one
direction
,
while
she
turned
in
the
other
;
it
was
a
purely
gypsy
*NL*
effect
.
But
,
disenchanted
though
Gringoire
was
,
the
whole
effect
of
*NL*
this
picture
was
not
without
its
charm
and
its
magic
;
the
bonfire
*NL*
illuminated
,
with
a
red
flaring
light
,
which
trembled
,
all
alive
,
over
*NL*
the
circle
of
faces
in
the
crowd
,
on
the
brow
of
the
young
girl
,
and
at
*NL*
the
background
of
the
Place
cast
a
pallid
reflection
,
on
one
side
upon
*NL*
the
ancient
,
black
,
and
wrinkled
facade
of
the
House
of
Pillars
,
on
the
*NL*
other
,
upon
the
old
stone
gibbet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
the
thousands
of
visages
which
that
light
tinged
with
scarlet
,
*NL*
there
was
one
which
seemed
,
even
more
than
all
the
others
,
absorbed
in
*NL*
contemplation
of
the
dancer
.
It
was
the
face
of
a
man
,
austere
,
calm
,
*NL*
and
sombre
.
This
man
,
whose
costume
was
concealed
by
the
crowd
which
*NL*
surrounded
him
,
did
not
appear
to
be
more
than
five
and
thirty
years
of
*NL*
age
;
nevertheless
,
he
was
bald
;
he
had
merely
a
few
tufts
of
thin
,
gray
*NL*
hair
on
his
temples
;
his
broad
,
high
forehead
had
begun
to
be
furrowed
*NL*
with
wrinkles
,
but
his
deep-set
eyes
sparkled
with
extraordinary
*NL*
youthfulness
,
an
ardent
life
,
a
profound
passion
.
He
kept
them
fixed
*NL*
incessantly
on
the
gypsy
,
and
,
while
the
giddy
young
girl
of
sixteen
*NL*
danced
and
whirled
,
for
the
pleasure
of
all
,
his
revery
seemed
to
become
*NL*
more
and
more
sombre
.
From
time
to
time
,
a
smile
and
a
sigh
met
upon
his
*NL*
lips
,
but
the
smile
was
more
melancholy
than
the
sigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
girl
,
stopped
at
length
,
breathless
,
and
the
people
applauded
*NL*
her
lovingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Djali
!
''
said
the
gypsy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Gringoire
saw
come
up
to
her
,
a
pretty
little
white
goat
,
alert
,
*NL*
wide-awake
,
glossy
,
with
gilded
horns
,
gilded
hoofs
,
and
gilded
collar
,
*NL*
which
he
had
not
hitherto
perceived
,
and
which
had
remained
lying
curled
*NL*
up
on
one
corner
of
the
carpet
watching
his
mistress
dance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Djali
!
''
said
the
dancer
,
``
it
is
your
turn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
seating
herself
,
she
gracefully
presented
her
tambourine
to
the
*NL*
goat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Djali
,
''
she
continued
,
``
what
month
is
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
goat
lifted
its
fore
foot
,
and
struck
one
blow
upon
the
tambourine
.
*NL*
It
was
the
first
month
in
the
year
,
in
fact
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Djali
,
''
pursued
the
young
girl
,
turning
her
tambourine
round
,
``
what
day
*NL*
of
the
month
is
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Djali
raised
his
little
gilt
hoof
,
and
struck
six
blows
on
the
*NL*
tambourine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Djali
,
''
pursued
the
Egyptian
,
with
still
another
movement
of
the
*NL*
tambourine
,
``
what
hour
of
the
day
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Djali
struck
seven
blows
.
At
that
moment
,
the
clock
of
the
Pillar
House
*NL*
rang
out
seven
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
people
were
amazed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
sorcery
at
the
bottom
of
it
,
''
said
a
sinister
voice
in
the
*NL*
crowd
.
It
was
that
of
the
bald
man
,
who
never
removed
his
eyes
from
the
*NL*
gypsy
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
shuddered
and
turned
round
;
but
applause
broke
forth
and
drowned
the
*NL*
morose
exclamation
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
even
effaced
it
so
completely
from
her
mind
,
that
she
continued
to
*NL*
question
her
goat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Djali
,
what
does
Master
Guichard
Grand-Remy
,
captain
of
the
pistoliers
*NL*
of
the
town
do
,
at
the
procession
of
Candlemas
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Djali
reared
himself
on
his
hind
legs
,
and
began
to
bleat
,
marching
*NL*
along
with
so
much
dainty
gravity
,
that
the
entire
circle
of
spectators
*NL*
burst
into
a
laugh
at
this
parody
of
the
interested
devoutness
of
the
*NL*
captain
of
pistoliers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Djali
,
''
resumed
the
young
girl
,
emboldened
by
her
growing
success
,
*NL*
``
how
preaches
Master
Jacques
Charmolue
,
procurator
to
the
king
in
the
*NL*
ecclesiastical
court
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
goat
seated
himself
on
his
hind
quarters
,
and
began
to
bleat
,
waving
*NL*
his
fore
feet
in
so
strange
a
manner
,
that
,
with
the
exception
of
*NL*
the
bad
French
,
and
worse
Latin
,
Jacques
Charmolue
was
there
*NL*
complete
,
--
gesture
,
accent
,
and
attitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
crowd
applauded
louder
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sacrilege
!
profanation
!
''
resumed
the
voice
of
the
bald
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gypsy
turned
round
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
she
,
''
't
is
that
villanous
man
!
''
Then
,
thrusting
her
under
*NL*
lip
out
beyond
the
upper
,
she
made
a
little
pout
,
which
appeared
to
*NL*
be
familiar
to
her
,
executed
a
pirouette
on
her
heel
,
and
set
about
*NL*
collecting
in
her
tambourine
the
gifts
of
the
multitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
Big
blanks
,
little
blanks
,
targes
*
and
eagle
liards
showered
into
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
A
blank
:
an
old
French
coin
;
six
blanks
were
worth
two
sous
*NL*
and
a
half
;
targe
,
an
ancient
coin
of
Burgundy
,
a
farthing
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
,
she
passed
in
front
of
Gringoire
.
Gringoire
put
his
hand
so
*NL*
recklessly
into
his
pocket
that
she
halted
.
``
The
devil
!
''
said
the
poet
,
*NL*
finding
at
the
bottom
of
his
pocket
the
reality
,
that
is
,
to
say
,
a
*NL*
void
.
In
the
meantime
,
the
pretty
girl
stood
there
,
gazing
at
him
*NL*
with
her
big
eyes
,
and
holding
out
her
tambourine
to
him
and
waiting
.
*NL*
Gringoire
broke
into
a
violent
perspiration
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
he
had
all
Peru
in
his
pocket
,
he
would
certainly
have
given
it
to
*NL*
the
dancer
;
but
Gringoire
had
not
Peru
,
and
,
moreover
,
America
had
not
*NL*
yet
been
discovered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Happily
,
an
unexpected
incident
came
to
his
rescue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
take
yourself
off
,
you
Egyptian
grasshopper
?
''
cried
a
sharp
*NL*
voice
,
which
proceeded
from
the
darkest
corner
of
the
Place
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
girl
turned
round
in
affright
.
It
was
no
longer
the
voice
of
*NL*
the
bald
man
;
it
was
the
voice
of
a
woman
,
bigoted
and
malicious
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
this
cry
,
which
alarmed
the
gypsy
,
delighted
a
troop
of
*NL*
children
who
were
prowling
about
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
the
recluse
of
the
Tour-Roland
,
''
they
exclaimed
,
with
wild
*NL*
laughter
,
``
it
is
the
sacked
nun
who
is
scolding
!
Has
n't
she
supped
?
*NL*
Let
's
carry
her
the
remains
of
the
city
refreshments
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
rushed
towards
the
Pillar
House
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meanwhile
,
Gringoire
had
taken
advantage
of
the
dancer
's
*NL*
embarrassment
,
to
disappear
.
The
children
's
shouts
had
reminded
him
that
*NL*
he
,
also
,
had
not
supped
,
so
he
ran
to
the
public
buffet
.
But
the
little
*NL*
rascals
had
better
legs
than
he
;
when
he
arrived
,
they
had
stripped
the
*NL*
table
.
There
remained
not
so
much
as
a
miserable
_
camichon
_
at
five
sous
*NL*
the
pound
.
Nothing
remained
upon
the
wall
but
slender
fleurs-de-lis
,
*NL*
mingled
with
rose
bushes
,
painted
in
1434
by
Mathieu
Biterne
.
It
was
a
*NL*
meagre
supper
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
an
unpleasant
thing
to
go
to
bed
without
supper
,
it
is
a
still
*NL*
less
pleasant
thing
not
to
sup
and
not
to
know
where
one
is
to
sleep
.
*NL*
That
was
Gringoire
's
condition
.
No
supper
,
no
shelter
;
he
saw
himself
*NL*
pressed
on
all
sides
by
necessity
,
and
he
found
necessity
very
crabbed
.
*NL*
He
had
long
ago
discovered
the
truth
,
that
Jupiter
created
men
during
a
*NL*
fit
of
misanthropy
,
and
that
during
a
wise
man
's
whole
life
,
his
destiny
*NL*
holds
his
philosophy
in
a
state
of
siege
.
As
for
himself
,
he
had
never
*NL*
seen
the
blockade
so
complete
;
he
heard
his
stomach
sounding
a
parley
,
*NL*
and
he
considered
it
very
much
out
of
place
that
evil
destiny
should
*NL*
capture
his
philosophy
by
famine
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
melancholy
revery
was
absorbing
him
more
and
more
,
when
a
song
,
*NL*
quaint
but
full
of
sweetness
,
suddenly
tore
him
from
it
.
It
was
the
*NL*
young
gypsy
who
was
singing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
voice
was
like
her
dancing
,
like
her
beauty
.
It
was
indefinable
*NL*
and
charming
;
something
pure
and
sonorous
,
aerial
,
winged
,
so
to
speak
.
*NL*
There
were
continual
outbursts
,
melodies
,
unexpected
cadences
,
then
*NL*
simple
phrases
strewn
with
aerial
and
hissing
notes
;
then
floods
of
*NL*
scales
which
would
have
put
a
nightingale
to
rout
,
but
in
which
harmony
*NL*
was
always
present
;
then
soft
modulations
of
octaves
which
rose
and
*NL*
fell
,
like
the
bosom
of
the
young
singer
.
Her
beautiful
face
followed
,
*NL*
with
singular
mobility
,
all
the
caprices
of
her
song
,
from
the
wildest
*NL*
inspiration
to
the
chastest
dignity
.
One
would
have
pronounced
her
now
a
*NL*
mad
creature
,
now
a
queen
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
words
which
she
sang
were
in
a
tongue
unknown
to
Gringoire
,
and
*NL*
which
seemed
to
him
to
be
unknown
to
herself
,
so
little
relation
did
*NL*
the
expression
which
she
imparted
to
her
song
bear
to
the
sense
of
the
*NL*
words
.
Thus
,
these
four
lines
,
in
her
mouth
,
were
madly
gay
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
_
Un
cofre
de
gran
riqueza
*NL*
Hallaron
dentro
un
pilar
,
*NL*
Dentro
del
,
nuevas
banderas
*NL*
Con
figuras
de
espantar
_
.
*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
A
coffer
of
great
richness
*NL*
In
a
pillar
's
heart
they
found
,
*NL*
Within
it
lay
new
banners
,
*NL*
With
figures
to
astound
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
And
an
instant
afterwards
,
at
the
accents
which
she
imparted
to
this
*NL*
stanza
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
_
Alarabes
de
cavallo
*NL*
Sin
poderse
menear
,
*NL*
Con
espadas
,
y
los
cuellos
,
*NL*
Ballestas
de
buen
echar
_
,
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Gringoire
felt
the
tears
start
to
his
eyes
.
Nevertheless
,
her
song
*NL*
breathed
joy
,
most
of
all
,
and
she
seemed
to
sing
like
a
bird
,
from
*NL*
serenity
and
heedlessness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gypsy
's
song
had
disturbed
Gringoire
's
revery
as
the
swan
disturbs
*NL*
the
water
.
He
listened
in
a
sort
of
rapture
,
and
forgetfulness
of
*NL*
everything
.
It
was
the
first
moment
in
the
course
of
many
hours
when
he
*NL*
did
not
feel
that
he
suffered
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
moment
was
brief
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
same
woman
's
voice
,
which
had
interrupted
the
gypsy
's
dance
,
*NL*
interrupted
her
song
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
hold
your
tongue
,
you
cricket
of
hell
?
''
it
cried
,
still
from
*NL*
the
same
obscure
corner
of
the
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
``
cricket
''
stopped
short
.
Gringoire
covered
up
his
ears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
``
accursed
saw
with
missing
teeth
,
which
comes
to
*NL*
break
the
lyre
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
the
other
spectators
murmured
like
himself
;
``
To
the
devil
*NL*
with
the
sacked
nun
!
''
said
some
of
them
.
And
the
old
invisible
kill-joy
*NL*
might
have
had
occasion
to
repent
of
her
aggressions
against
the
gypsy
*NL*
had
their
attention
not
been
diverted
at
this
moment
by
the
procession
*NL*
of
the
Pope
of
the
Fools
,
which
,
after
having
traversed
many
streets
and
*NL*
squares
,
debouched
on
the
Place
de
Greve
,
with
all
its
torches
and
all
*NL*
its
uproar
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
procession
,
which
our
readers
have
seen
set
out
from
the
Palais
*NL*
de
Justice
,
had
organized
on
the
way
,
and
had
been
recruited
by
all
*NL*
the
knaves
,
idle
thieves
,
and
unemployed
vagabonds
in
Paris
;
so
that
it
*NL*
presented
a
very
respectable
aspect
when
it
arrived
at
the
Greve
.
*NL*
*NL*
First
came
Egypt
.
The
Duke
of
Egypt
headed
it
,
on
horseback
,
with
his
*NL*
counts
on
foot
holding
his
bridle
and
stirrups
for
him
;
behind
them
,
the
*NL*
male
and
female
Egyptians
,
pell-mell
,
with
their
little
children
*NL*
crying
on
their
shoulders
;
all
--
duke
,
counts
,
and
populace
--
in
rags
and
*NL*
tatters
.
Then
came
the
Kingdom
of
Argot
;
that
is
to
say
,
all
the
thieves
*NL*
of
France
,
arranged
according
to
the
order
of
their
dignity
;
the
minor
*NL*
people
walking
first
.
Thus
defiled
by
fours
,
with
the
divers
insignia
of
*NL*
their
grades
,
in
that
strange
faculty
,
most
of
them
lame
,
some
*NL*
cripples
,
others
one-armed
,
shop
clerks
,
pilgrim
,
_
hubins
_
,
bootblacks
,
*NL*
thimble-riggers
,
street
arabs
,
beggars
,
the
blear-eyed
beggars
,
thieves
,
*NL*
the
weakly
,
vagabonds
,
merchants
,
sham
soldiers
,
goldsmiths
,
passed
*NL*
masters
of
pickpockets
,
isolated
thieves
.
A
catalogue
that
would
*NL*
weary
Homer
.
In
the
centre
of
the
conclave
of
the
passed
masters
of
*NL*
pickpockets
,
one
had
some
difficulty
in
distinguishing
the
King
of
*NL*
Argot
,
the
grand
coesre
,
so
called
,
crouching
in
a
little
cart
drawn
*NL*
by
two
big
dogs
.
After
the
kingdom
of
the
Argotiers
,
came
the
Empire
of
*NL*
Galilee
.
Guillaume
Rousseau
,
Emperor
of
the
Empire
of
Galilee
,
marched
*NL*
majestically
in
his
robe
of
purple
,
spotted
with
wine
,
preceded
by
*NL*
buffoons
wrestling
and
executing
military
dances
;
surrounded
by
his
*NL*
macebearers
,
his
pickpockets
and
clerks
of
the
chamber
of
accounts
.
Last
*NL*
of
all
came
the
corporation
of
law
clerks
,
with
its
maypoles
crowned
*NL*
with
flowers
,
its
black
robes
,
its
music
worthy
of
the
orgy
,
and
its
*NL*
large
candles
of
yellow
wax
.
In
the
centre
of
this
crowd
,
the
grand
*NL*
officers
of
the
Brotherhood
of
Fools
bore
on
their
shoulders
a
litter
*NL*
more
loaded
down
with
candles
than
the
reliquary
of
Sainte-Genevieve
in
*NL*
time
of
pest
;
and
on
this
litter
shone
resplendent
,
with
crosier
,
cope
,
*NL*
and
mitre
,
the
new
Pope
of
the
Fools
,
the
bellringer
of
Notre-Dame
,
*NL*
Quasimodo
the
hunchback
.
*NL*
*NL*
Each
section
of
this
grotesque
procession
had
its
own
music
.
The
*NL*
Egyptians
made
their
drums
and
African
tambourines
resound
.
The
slang
*NL*
men
,
not
a
very
musical
race
,
still
clung
to
the
goat
's
horn
trumpet
and
*NL*
the
Gothic
rubebbe
of
the
twelfth
century
.
The
Empire
of
Galilee
was
not
*NL*
much
more
advanced
;
among
its
music
one
could
hardly
distinguish
some
*NL*
miserable
rebec
,
from
the
infancy
of
the
art
,
still
imprisoned
in
the
*NL*
_
re-la-mi
_
.
But
it
was
around
the
Pope
of
the
Fools
that
all
the
musical
*NL*
riches
of
the
epoch
were
displayed
in
a
magnificent
discord
.
It
was
*NL*
nothing
but
soprano
rebecs
,
counter-tenor
rebecs
,
and
tenor
rebecs
,
*NL*
not
to
reckon
the
flutes
and
brass
instruments
.
Alas
!
our
readers
will
*NL*
remember
that
this
was
Gringoire
's
orchestra
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
difficult
to
convey
an
idea
of
the
degree
of
proud
and
blissful
*NL*
expansion
to
which
the
sad
and
hideous
visage
of
Quasimodo
had
attained
*NL*
during
the
transit
from
the
Palais
de
Justice
,
to
the
Place
de
Greve
.
It
*NL*
was
the
first
enjoyment
of
self-love
that
he
had
ever
experienced
.
Down
*NL*
to
that
day
,
he
had
known
only
humiliation
,
disdain
for
his
condition
,
*NL*
disgust
for
his
person
.
Hence
,
deaf
though
he
was
,
he
enjoyed
,
like
a
*NL*
veritable
pope
,
the
acclamations
of
that
throng
,
which
he
hated
because
*NL*
he
felt
that
he
was
hated
by
it
.
What
mattered
it
that
his
people
*NL*
consisted
of
a
pack
of
fools
,
cripples
,
thieves
,
and
beggars
?
it
was
*NL*
still
a
people
and
he
was
its
sovereign
.
And
he
accepted
seriously
all
*NL*
this
ironical
applause
,
all
this
derisive
respect
,
with
which
the
crowd
*NL*
mingled
,
it
must
be
admitted
,
a
good
deal
of
very
real
fear
.
For
the
*NL*
hunchback
was
robust
;
for
the
bandy-legged
fellow
was
agile
;
for
the
*NL*
deaf
man
was
malicious
:
three
qualities
which
temper
ridicule
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
are
far
from
believing
,
however
,
that
the
new
Pope
of
the
Fools
*NL*
understood
both
the
sentiments
which
he
felt
and
the
sentiments
which
*NL*
he
inspired
.
The
spirit
which
was
lodged
in
this
failure
of
a
body
had
,
*NL*
necessarily
,
something
incomplete
and
deaf
about
it
.
Thus
,
what
he
felt
*NL*
at
the
moment
was
to
him
,
absolutely
vague
,
indistinct
,
and
confused
.
*NL*
Only
joy
made
itself
felt
,
only
pride
dominated
.
Around
that
sombre
and
*NL*
unhappy
face
,
there
hung
a
radiance
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
,
then
,
not
without
surprise
and
alarm
,
that
at
the
very
moment
*NL*
when
Quasimodo
was
passing
the
Pillar
House
,
in
that
semi-intoxicated
*NL*
state
,
a
man
was
seen
to
dart
from
the
crowd
,
and
to
tear
from
his
*NL*
hands
,
with
a
gesture
of
anger
,
his
crosier
of
gilded
wood
,
the
emblem
*NL*
of
his
mock
popeship
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
man
,
this
rash
individual
,
was
the
man
with
the
bald
brow
,
who
,
*NL*
a
moment
earlier
,
standing
with
the
gypsy
's
group
had
chilled
the
*NL*
poor
girl
with
his
words
of
menace
and
of
hatred
.
He
was
dressed
in
*NL*
an
ecclesiastical
costume
.
At
the
moment
when
he
stood
forth
from
the
*NL*
crowd
,
Gringoire
,
who
had
not
noticed
him
up
to
that
time
,
recognized
*NL*
him
:
``
Hold
!
''
he
said
,
with
an
exclamation
of
astonishment
.
``
Eh
!
't
is
my
*NL*
master
in
Hermes
,
Dom
Claude
Frollo
,
the
archdeacon
!
What
the
devil
does
*NL*
he
want
of
that
old
one-eyed
fellow
?
He
'll
get
himself
devoured
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
cry
of
terror
arose
,
in
fact
.
The
formidable
Quasimodo
had
hurled
*NL*
himself
from
the
litter
,
and
the
women
turned
aside
their
eyes
in
order
*NL*
not
to
see
him
tear
the
archdeacon
asunder
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
one
bound
as
far
as
the
priest
,
looked
at
him
,
and
fell
upon
his
*NL*
knees
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
priest
tore
off
his
tiara
,
broke
his
crozier
,
and
rent
his
tinsel
*NL*
cope
.
*NL*
*NL*
Quasimodo
remained
on
his
knees
,
with
head
bent
and
hands
clasped
.
*NL*
Then
there
was
established
between
them
a
strange
dialogue
of
signs
*NL*
and
gestures
,
for
neither
of
them
spoke
.
The
priest
,
erect
on
his
*NL*
feet
,
irritated
,
threatening
,
imperious
;
Quasimodo
,
prostrate
,
humble
,
*NL*
suppliant
.
And
,
nevertheless
,
it
is
certain
that
Quasimodo
could
have
*NL*
crushed
the
priest
with
his
thumb
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
the
archdeacon
,
giving
Quasimodo
's
powerful
shoulder
a
rough
*NL*
shake
,
made
him
a
sign
to
rise
and
follow
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Quasimodo
rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
Brotherhood
of
Fools
,
their
first
stupor
having
passed
off
,
*NL*
wished
to
defend
their
pope
,
so
abruptly
dethroned
.
The
Egyptians
,
the
*NL*
men
of
slang
,
and
all
the
fraternity
of
law
clerks
,
gathered
howling
*NL*
round
the
priest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Quasimodo
placed
himself
in
front
of
the
priest
,
set
in
play
the
muscles
*NL*
of
his
athletic
fists
,
and
glared
upon
the
assailants
with
the
snarl
of
*NL*
an
angry
tiger
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
priest
resumed
his
sombre
gravity
,
made
a
sign
to
Quasimodo
,
and
*NL*
retired
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Quasimodo
walked
in
front
of
him
,
scattering
the
crowd
as
he
passed
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
had
traversed
the
populace
and
the
Place
,
the
cloud
of
curious
*NL*
and
idle
were
minded
to
follow
them
.
Quasimodo
then
constituted
himself
*NL*
the
rearguard
,
and
followed
the
archdeacon
,
walking
backwards
,
squat
,
*NL*
surly
,
monstrous
,
bristling
,
gathering
up
his
limbs
,
licking
his
boar
's
*NL*
tusks
,
growling
like
a
wild
beast
,
and
imparting
to
the
crowd
immense
*NL*
vibrations
,
with
a
look
or
a
gesture
.
*NL*
*NL*
Both
were
allowed
to
plunge
into
a
dark
and
narrow
street
,
where
no
*NL*
one
dared
to
venture
after
them
;
so
thoroughly
did
the
mere
chimera
of
*NL*
Quasimodo
gnashing
his
teeth
bar
the
entrance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
's
a
marvellous
thing
,
''
said
Gringoire
;
``
but
where
the
deuce
shall
*NL*
I
find
some
supper
?

CHAPTER
IV
.
THE
INCONVENIENCES
OF
FOLLOWING
A
PRETTY
WOMAN
THROUGH
THE
*NL*
STREETS
IN
THE
EVENING
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Gringoire
set
out
to
follow
the
gypsy
at
all
hazards
.
He
had
seen
her
,
*NL*
accompanied
by
her
goat
,
take
to
the
Rue
de
la
Coutellerie
;
he
took
the
*NL*
Rue
de
la
Coutellerie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
''
he
said
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gringoire
,
a
practical
philosopher
of
the
streets
of
Paris
,
had
noticed
*NL*
that
nothing
is
more
propitious
to
revery
than
following
a
pretty
*NL*
woman
without
knowing
whither
she
is
going
.
There
was
in
this
voluntary
*NL*
abdication
of
his
freewill
,
in
this
fancy
submitting
itself
to
another
*NL*
fancy
,
which
suspects
it
not
,
a
mixture
of
fantastic
independence
and
*NL*
blind
obedience
,
something
indescribable
,
intermediate
between
slavery
*NL*
and
liberty
,
which
pleased
Gringoire
,
--
a
spirit
essentially
compound
,
*NL*
undecided
,
and
complex
,
holding
the
extremities
of
all
extremes
,
*NL*
incessantly
suspended
between
all
human
propensities
,
and
neutralizing
*NL*
one
by
the
other
.
He
was
fond
of
comparing
himself
to
Mahomet
's
coffin
,
*NL*
attracted
in
two
different
directions
by
two
loadstones
,
and
hesitating
*NL*
eternally
between
the
heights
and
the
depths
,
between
the
vault
and
the
*NL*
pavement
,
between
fall
and
ascent
,
between
zenith
and
nadir
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
Gringoire
had
lived
in
our
day
,
what
a
fine
middle
course
he
would
*NL*
hold
between
classicism
and
romanticism
!
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
was
not
sufficiently
primitive
to
live
three
hundred
years
,
*NL*
and
't
is
a
pity
.
His
absence
is
a
void
which
is
but
too
sensibly
felt
*NL*
to-day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
for
the
purpose
of
thus
following
passers-by
-LRB-
and
especially
*NL*
female
passers-by
-RRB-
in
the
streets
,
which
Gringoire
was
fond
of
doing
,
*NL*
there
is
no
better
disposition
than
ignorance
of
where
one
is
going
to
*NL*
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
walked
along
,
very
thoughtfully
,
behind
the
young
girl
,
who
*NL*
hastened
her
pace
and
made
her
goat
trot
as
she
saw
the
bourgeois
*NL*
returning
home
and
the
taverns
--
the
only
shops
which
had
been
open
that
*NL*
day
--
closing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
all
,
''
he
half
thought
to
himself
,
``
she
must
lodge
somewhere
;
*NL*
gypsies
have
kindly
hearts
.
Who
knows
?
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
in
the
points
of
suspense
which
he
placed
after
this
reticence
in
*NL*
his
mind
,
there
lay
I
know
not
what
flattering
ideas
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
from
time
to
time
,
as
he
passed
the
last
groups
of
bourgeois
*NL*
closing
their
doors
,
he
caught
some
scraps
of
their
conversation
,
which
*NL*
broke
the
thread
of
his
pleasant
hypotheses
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
it
was
two
old
men
accosting
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
that
it
is
cold
,
Master
Thibaut
Fernicle
?
''
-LRB-
Gringoire
had
*NL*
been
aware
of
this
since
the
beginning
of
the
winter
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
indeed
,
Master
Boniface
Disome
!
Are
we
going
to
have
a
winter
*NL*
such
as
we
had
three
years
ago
,
in
'
80
,
when
wood
cost
eight
sous
the
*NL*
measure
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bah
!
that
's
nothing
,
Master
Thibaut
,
compared
with
the
winter
of
1407
,
*NL*
when
it
froze
from
St.
Martin
's
Day
until
Candlemas
!
and
so
cold
that
*NL*
the
pen
of
the
registrar
of
the
parliament
froze
every
three
words
,
in
*NL*
the
Grand
Chamber
!
which
interrupted
the
registration
of
justice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Further
on
there
were
two
female
neighbors
at
their
windows
,
holding
*NL*
candles
,
which
the
fog
caused
to
sputter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
your
husband
told
you
about
the
mishap
,
Mademoiselle
la
Boudraque
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
What
is
it
,
Mademoiselle
Turquant
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
horse
of
M.
Gilles
Godin
,
the
notary
at
the
Chatelet
,
took
fright
*NL*
at
the
Flemings
and
their
procession
,
and
overturned
Master
Philippe
*NL*
Avrillot
,
lay
monk
of
the
Celestins
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Actually
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
bourgeois
horse
!
't
is
rather
too
much
!
If
it
had
been
a
cavalry
*NL*
horse
,
well
and
good
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
windows
were
closed
.
But
Gringoire
had
lost
the
thread
of
his
*NL*
ideas
,
nevertheless
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fortunately
,
he
speedily
found
it
again
,
and
he
knotted
it
together
*NL*
without
difficulty
,
thanks
to
the
gypsy
,
thanks
to
Djali
,
who
still
*NL*
walked
in
front
of
him
;
two
fine
,
delicate
,
and
charming
creatures
,
*NL*
whose
tiny
feet
,
beautiful
forms
,
and
graceful
manners
he
was
engaged
in
*NL*
admiring
,
almost
confusing
them
in
his
contemplation
;
believing
them
*NL*
to
be
both
young
girls
,
from
their
intelligence
and
good
friendship
;
*NL*
regarding
them
both
as
goats
,
--
so
far
as
the
lightness
,
agility
,
and
*NL*
dexterity
of
their
walk
were
concerned
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
streets
were
becoming
blacker
and
more
deserted
every
moment
.
*NL*
The
curfew
had
sounded
long
ago
,
and
it
was
only
at
rare
intervals
*NL*
now
that
they
encountered
a
passer-by
in
the
street
,
or
a
light
in
the
*NL*
windows
.
Gringoire
had
become
involved
,
in
his
pursuit
of
the
gypsy
,
in
*NL*
that
inextricable
labyrinth
of
alleys
,
squares
,
and
closed
courts
*NL*
which
surround
the
ancient
sepulchre
of
the
Saints-Innocents
,
and
which
*NL*
resembles
a
ball
of
thread
tangled
by
a
cat
.
``
Here
are
streets
which
*NL*
possess
but
little
logic
!
''
said
Gringoire
,
lost
in
the
thousands
of
*NL*
circuits
which
returned
upon
themselves
incessantly
,
but
where
the
young
*NL*
girl
pursued
a
road
which
seemed
familiar
to
her
,
without
hesitation
and
*NL*
with
a
step
which
became
ever
more
rapid
.
As
for
him
,
he
would
have
been
*NL*
utterly
ignorant
of
his
situation
had
he
not
espied
,
in
passing
,
at
the
*NL*
turn
of
a
street
,
the
octagonal
mass
of
the
pillory
of
the
fish
markets
,
*NL*
the
open-work
summit
of
which
threw
its
black
,
fretted
outlines
clearly
*NL*
upon
a
window
which
was
still
lighted
in
the
Rue
Verdelet
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
girl
's
attention
had
been
attracted
to
him
for
the
last
few
*NL*
moments
;
she
had
repeatedly
turned
her
head
towards
him
with
uneasiness
;
*NL*
she
had
even
once
come
to
a
standstill
,
and
taking
advantage
of
a
ray
of
*NL*
light
which
escaped
from
a
half-open
bakery
to
survey
him
intently
,
from
*NL*
head
to
foot
,
then
,
having
cast
this
glance
,
Gringoire
had
seen
her
make
*NL*
that
little
pout
which
he
had
already
noticed
,
after
which
she
passed
*NL*
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
little
pout
had
furnished
Gringoire
with
food
for
thought
.
There
*NL*
was
certainly
both
disdain
and
mockery
in
that
graceful
grimace
.
So
he
*NL*
dropped
his
head
,
began
to
count
the
paving-stones
,
and
to
follow
the
*NL*
young
girl
at
a
little
greater
distance
,
when
,
at
the
turn
of
a
street
,
*NL*
which
had
caused
him
to
lose
sight
of
her
,
he
heard
her
utter
a
piercing
*NL*
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
hastened
his
steps
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
street
was
full
of
shadows
.
Nevertheless
,
a
twist
of
tow
soaked
in
*NL*
oil
,
which
burned
in
a
cage
at
the
feet
of
the
Holy
Virgin
at
the
street
*NL*
corner
,
permitted
Gringoire
to
make
out
the
gypsy
struggling
in
the
arms
*NL*
of
two
men
,
who
were
endeavoring
to
stifle
her
cries
.
The
poor
little
*NL*
goat
,
in
great
alarm
,
lowered
his
horns
and
bleated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Help
!
gentlemen
of
the
watch
!
''
shouted
Gringoire
,
and
advanced
bravely
.
*NL*
One
of
the
men
who
held
the
young
girl
turned
towards
him
.
It
was
the
*NL*
formidable
visage
of
Quasimodo
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gringoire
did
not
take
to
flight
,
but
neither
did
he
advance
another
*NL*
step
.
*NL*
*NL*
Quasimodo
came
up
to
him
,
tossed
him
four
paces
away
on
the
pavement
*NL*
with
a
backward
turn
of
the
hand
,
and
plunged
rapidly
into
the
gloom
,
*NL*
bearing
the
young
girl
folded
across
one
arm
like
a
silken
scarf
.
His
*NL*
companion
followed
him
,
and
the
poor
goat
ran
after
them
all
,
bleating
*NL*
plaintively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Murder
!
murder
!
''
shrieked
the
unhappy
gypsy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Halt
,
rascals
,
and
yield
me
that
wench
!
''
suddenly
shouted
in
a
voice
of
*NL*
thunder
,
a
cavalier
who
appeared
suddenly
from
a
neighboring
square
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
captain
of
the
king
's
archers
,
armed
from
head
to
foot
,
with
*NL*
his
sword
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
tore
the
gypsy
from
the
arms
of
the
dazed
Quasimodo
,
threw
her
across
*NL*
his
saddle
,
and
at
the
moment
when
the
terrible
hunchback
,
recovering
*NL*
from
his
surprise
,
rushed
upon
him
to
regain
his
prey
,
fifteen
or
*NL*
sixteen
archers
,
who
followed
their
captain
closely
,
made
their
*NL*
appearance
,
with
their
two-edged
swords
in
their
fists
.
It
was
a
squad
*NL*
of
the
king
's
police
,
which
was
making
the
rounds
,
by
order
of
Messire
*NL*
Robert
d'Estouteville
,
guard
of
the
provostship
of
Paris
.
*NL*
*NL*
Quasimodo
was
surrounded
,
seized
,
garroted
;
he
roared
,
he
foamed
at
the
*NL*
mouth
,
he
bit
;
and
had
it
been
broad
daylight
,
there
is
no
doubt
that
*NL*
his
face
alone
,
rendered
more
hideous
by
wrath
,
would
have
put
the
*NL*
entire
squad
to
flight
.
But
by
night
he
was
deprived
of
his
most
*NL*
formidable
weapon
,
his
ugliness
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
companion
had
disappeared
during
the
struggle
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gypsy
gracefully
raised
herself
upright
upon
the
officer
's
saddle
,
*NL*
placed
both
hands
upon
the
young
man
's
shoulders
,
and
gazed
fixedly
at
*NL*
him
for
several
seconds
,
as
though
enchanted
with
his
good
looks
and
*NL*
with
the
aid
which
he
had
just
rendered
her
.
Then
breaking
silence
*NL*
first
,
she
said
to
him
,
making
her
sweet
voice
still
sweeter
than
*NL*
usual
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
your
name
,
monsieur
le
gendarme
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Captain
Phoebus
de
Chateaupers
,
at
your
service
,
my
beauty
!
''
replied
*NL*
the
officer
,
drawing
himself
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks
,
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
while
Captain
Phoebus
was
turning
up
his
moustache
in
Burgundian
*NL*
fashion
,
she
slipped
from
the
horse
,
like
an
arrow
falling
to
earth
,
and
*NL*
fled
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
flash
of
lightning
would
have
vanished
less
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nombrill
of
the
Pope
!
''
said
the
captain
,
causing
Quasimodo
's
straps
to
*NL*
be
drawn
tighter
,
``
I
should
have
preferred
to
keep
the
wench
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
would
you
have
,
captain
?
''
said
one
gendarme
.
``
The
warbler
has
*NL*
fled
,
and
the
bat
remains
.

CHAPTER
V.
RESULT
OF
THE
DANGERS
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Gringoire
,
thoroughly
stunned
by
his
fall
,
remained
on
the
pavement
*NL*
in
front
of
the
Holy
Virgin
at
the
street
corner
.
Little
by
little
,
he
*NL*
regained
his
senses
;
at
first
,
for
several
minutes
,
he
was
floating
in
a
*NL*
sort
of
half-somnolent
revery
,
which
was
not
without
its
charm
,
in
which
*NL*
aeriel
figures
of
the
gypsy
and
her
goat
were
coupled
with
Quasimodo
's
*NL*
heavy
fist
.
This
state
lasted
but
a
short
time
.
A
decidedly
vivid
*NL*
sensation
of
cold
in
the
part
of
his
body
which
was
in
contact
with
the
*NL*
pavement
,
suddenly
aroused
him
and
caused
his
spirit
to
return
to
the
*NL*
surface
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whence
comes
this
chill
?
''
he
said
abruptly
,
to
himself
.
He
then
*NL*
perceived
that
he
was
lying
half
in
the
middle
of
the
gutter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
devil
of
a
hunchbacked
cyclops
!
''
he
muttered
between
his
teeth
;
*NL*
and
he
tried
to
rise
.
But
he
was
too
much
dazed
and
bruised
;
he
was
*NL*
forced
to
remain
where
he
was
.
Moreover
,
his
hand
was
tolerably
free
;
he
*NL*
stopped
up
his
nose
and
resigned
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
mud
of
Paris
,
''
he
said
to
himself
--
for
decidedly
he
thought
that
he
*NL*
was
sure
that
the
gutter
would
prove
his
refuge
for
the
night
;
and
what
*NL*
can
one
do
in
a
refuge
,
except
dream
?
--
``
the
mud
of
Paris
is
particularly
*NL*
stinking
;
it
must
contain
a
great
deal
of
volatile
and
nitric
salts
.
*NL*
That
,
moreover
,
is
the
opinion
of
Master
Nicholas
Flamel
,
and
of
the
*NL*
alchemists
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
word
``
alchemists
''
suddenly
suggested
to
his
mind
the
idea
of
*NL*
Archdeacon
Claude
Frollo
.
He
recalled
the
violent
scene
which
he
had
*NL*
just
witnessed
in
part
;
that
the
gypsy
was
struggling
with
two
men
,
*NL*
that
Quasimodo
had
a
companion
;
and
the
morose
and
haughty
face
of
*NL*
the
archdeacon
passed
confusedly
through
his
memory
.
``
That
would
be
*NL*
strange
!
''
he
said
to
himself
.
And
on
that
fact
and
that
basis
he
began
*NL*
to
construct
a
fantastic
edifice
of
hypothesis
,
that
card-castle
of
*NL*
philosophers
;
then
,
suddenly
returning
once
more
to
reality
,
``
Come
!
I
'm
*NL*
freezing
!
''
he
ejaculated
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
place
was
,
in
fact
,
becoming
less
and
less
tenable
.
Each
molecule
*NL*
of
the
gutter
bore
away
a
molecule
of
heat
radiating
from
Gringoire
's
*NL*
loins
,
and
the
equilibrium
between
the
temperature
of
his
body
and
the
*NL*
temperature
of
the
brook
,
began
to
be
established
in
rough
fashion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Quite
a
different
annoyance
suddenly
assailed
him
.
A
group
of
children
,
*NL*
those
little
bare-footed
savages
who
have
always
roamed
the
pavements
*NL*
of
Paris
under
the
eternal
name
of
_
gamins
_
,
and
who
,
when
we
were
also
*NL*
children
ourselves
,
threw
stones
at
all
of
us
in
the
afternoon
,
when
we
*NL*
came
out
of
school
,
because
our
trousers
were
not
torn
--
a
swarm
of
these
*NL*
young
scamps
rushed
towards
the
square
where
Gringoire
lay
,
with
shouts
*NL*
and
laughter
which
seemed
to
pay
but
little
heed
to
the
sleep
of
the
*NL*
neighbors
.
They
were
dragging
after
them
some
sort
of
hideous
sack
;
*NL*
and
the
noise
of
their
wooden
shoes
alone
would
have
roused
the
dead
.
*NL*
Gringoire
who
was
not
quite
dead
yet
,
half
raised
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ohe
,
Hennequin
Dandeche
!
Ohe
,
Jehan
Pincebourde
!
''
they
shouted
in
*NL*
deafening
tones
,
``
old
Eustache
Moubon
,
the
merchant
at
the
corner
,
has
*NL*
just
died
.
We
've
got
his
straw
pallet
,
we
're
going
to
have
a
bonfire
out
*NL*
of
it
.
It
's
the
turn
of
the
Flemish
to-day
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
behold
,
they
flung
the
pallet
directly
upon
Gringoire
,
beside
whom
*NL*
they
had
arrived
,
without
espying
him
.
At
the
same
time
,
one
of
them
*NL*
took
a
handful
of
straw
and
set
off
to
light
it
at
the
wick
of
the
good
*NL*
Virgin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
S'death
!
''
growled
Gringoire
,
``
am
I
going
to
be
too
warm
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
critical
moment
.
He
was
caught
between
fire
and
water
;
he
made
*NL*
a
superhuman
effort
,
the
effort
of
a
counterfeiter
of
money
who
is
on
*NL*
the
point
of
being
boiled
,
and
who
seeks
to
escape
.
He
rose
to
his
feet
,
*NL*
flung
aside
the
straw
pallet
upon
the
street
urchins
,
and
fled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Holy
Virgin
!
''
shrieked
the
children
;
''
't
is
the
merchant
's
ghost
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
they
fled
in
their
turn
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
straw
mattress
remained
master
of
the
field
.
Belleforet
,
Father
*NL*
Le
Juge
,
and
Corrozet
affirm
that
it
was
picked
up
on
the
morrow
,
with
*NL*
great
pomp
,
by
the
clergy
of
the
quarter
,
and
borne
to
the
treasury
*NL*
of
the
church
of
Saint
Opportune
,
where
the
sacristan
,
even
as
late
as
*NL*
1789
,
earned
a
tolerably
handsome
revenue
out
of
the
great
miracle
of
*NL*
the
Statue
of
the
Virgin
at
the
corner
of
the
Rue
Mauconseil
,
which
*NL*
had
,
by
its
mere
presence
,
on
the
memorable
night
between
the
sixth
and
*NL*
seventh
of
January
,
1482
,
exorcised
the
defunct
Eustache
Moubon
,
who
,
*NL*
in
order
to
play
a
trick
on
the
devil
,
had
at
his
death
maliciously
*NL*
concealed
his
soul
in
his
straw
pallet
.

CHAPTER
VI
.
THE
BROKEN
JUG
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
After
having
run
for
some
time
at
the
top
of
his
speed
,
without
knowing
*NL*
whither
,
knocking
his
head
against
many
a
street
corner
,
leaping
many
a
*NL*
gutter
,
traversing
many
an
alley
,
many
a
court
,
many
a
square
,
seeking
*NL*
flight
and
passage
through
all
the
meanderings
of
the
ancient
passages
*NL*
of
the
Halles
,
exploring
in
his
panic
terror
what
the
fine
Latin
of
the
*NL*
maps
calls
_
tota
via
,
cheminum
et
viaria
_
,
our
poet
suddenly
halted
for
*NL*
lack
of
breath
in
the
first
place
,
and
in
the
second
,
because
he
had
*NL*
been
collared
,
after
a
fashion
,
by
a
dilemma
which
had
just
occurred
to
*NL*
his
mind
.
``
It
strikes
me
,
Master
Pierre
Gringoire
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
*NL*
placing
his
finger
to
his
brow
,
``
that
you
are
running
like
a
madman
.
The
*NL*
little
scamps
are
no
less
afraid
of
you
than
you
are
of
them
.
It
strikes
*NL*
me
,
I
say
,
that
you
heard
the
clatter
of
their
wooden
shoes
fleeing
*NL*
southward
,
while
you
were
fleeing
northward
.
Now
,
one
of
two
things
,
*NL*
either
they
have
taken
flight
,
and
the
pallet
,
which
they
must
have
*NL*
forgotten
in
their
terror
,
is
precisely
that
hospitable
bed
in
search
*NL*
of
which
you
have
been
running
ever
since
morning
,
and
which
madame
the
*NL*
Virgin
miraculously
sends
you
,
in
order
to
recompense
you
for
having
*NL*
made
a
morality
in
her
honor
,
accompanied
by
triumphs
and
mummeries
;
or
*NL*
the
children
have
not
taken
flight
,
and
in
that
case
they
have
put
the
*NL*
brand
to
the
pallet
,
and
that
is
precisely
the
good
fire
which
you
need
*NL*
to
cheer
,
dry
,
and
warm
you
.
In
either
case
,
good
fire
or
good
bed
,
that
*NL*
straw
pallet
is
a
gift
from
heaven
.
The
blessed
Virgin
Marie
who
stands
*NL*
at
the
corner
of
the
Rue
Mauconseil
,
could
only
have
made
Eustache
*NL*
Moubon
die
for
that
express
purpose
;
and
it
is
folly
on
your
part
to
*NL*
flee
thus
zigzag
,
like
a
Picard
before
a
Frenchman
,
leaving
behind
you
*NL*
what
you
seek
before
you
;
and
you
are
a
fool
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
retraced
his
steps
,
and
feeling
his
way
and
searching
,
with
his
*NL*
nose
to
the
wind
and
his
ears
on
the
alert
,
he
tried
to
find
the
*NL*
blessed
pallet
again
,
but
in
vain
.
There
was
nothing
to
be
found
but
*NL*
intersections
of
houses
,
closed
courts
,
and
crossings
of
streets
,
in
*NL*
the
midst
of
which
he
hesitated
and
doubted
incessantly
,
being
more
*NL*
perplexed
and
entangled
in
this
medley
of
streets
than
he
would
have
*NL*
been
even
in
the
labyrinth
of
the
Hotel
des
Tournelles
.
At
length
he
*NL*
lost
patience
,
and
exclaimed
solemnly
:
``
Cursed
be
cross
roads
!
't
is
the
*NL*
devil
who
has
made
them
in
the
shape
of
his
pitchfork
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
exclamation
afforded
him
a
little
solace
,
and
a
sort
of
reddish
*NL*
reflection
which
he
caught
sight
of
at
that
moment
,
at
the
extremity
of
*NL*
a
long
and
narrow
lane
,
completed
the
elevation
of
his
moral
tone
.
``
God
*NL*
be
praised
!
''
said
he
,
``
There
it
is
yonder
!
There
is
my
pallet
burning
.
''
*NL*
And
comparing
himself
to
the
pilot
who
suffers
shipwreck
by
night
,
*NL*
''
_
Salve
_
,
''
he
added
piously
,
''
_
salve
,
maris
stella
_
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Did
he
address
this
fragment
of
litany
to
the
Holy
Virgin
,
or
to
the
*NL*
pallet
?
We
are
utterly
unable
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
taken
but
a
few
steps
in
the
long
street
,
which
sloped
downwards
,
*NL*
was
unpaved
,
and
more
and
more
muddy
and
steep
,
when
he
noticed
a
very
*NL*
singular
thing
.
It
was
not
deserted
;
here
and
there
along
its
extent
*NL*
crawled
certain
vague
and
formless
masses
,
all
directing
their
course
*NL*
towards
the
light
which
flickered
at
the
end
of
the
street
,
like
those
*NL*
heavy
insects
which
drag
along
by
night
,
from
blade
to
blade
of
grass
,
*NL*
towards
the
shepherd
's
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
renders
one
so
adventurous
as
not
being
able
to
feel
the
place
*NL*
where
one
's
pocket
is
situated
.
Gringoire
continued
to
advance
,
and
had
*NL*
soon
joined
that
one
of
the
forms
which
dragged
along
most
indolently
,
*NL*
behind
the
others
.
On
drawing
near
,
he
perceived
that
it
was
nothing
*NL*
else
than
a
wretched
legless
cripple
in
a
bowl
,
who
was
hopping
along
on
*NL*
his
two
hands
like
a
wounded
field-spider
which
has
but
two
legs
left
.
*NL*
At
the
moment
when
he
passed
close
to
this
species
of
spider
with
a
*NL*
human
countenance
,
it
raised
towards
him
a
lamentable
voice
:
''
_
La
buona
*NL*
mancia
,
signor
!
la
buona
mancia
_
!
''
*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
Alms
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Deuce
take
you
,
''
said
Gringoire
,
``
and
me
with
you
,
if
I
know
what
you
*NL*
mean
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
passed
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
overtook
another
of
these
itinerant
masses
,
and
examined
it
.
It
was
*NL*
an
impotent
man
,
both
halt
and
crippled
,
and
halt
and
crippled
to
such
*NL*
a
degree
that
the
complicated
system
of
crutches
and
wooden
legs
which
*NL*
sustained
him
,
gave
him
the
air
of
a
mason
's
scaffolding
on
the
march
.
*NL*
Gringoire
,
who
liked
noble
and
classical
comparisons
,
compared
him
in
*NL*
thought
to
the
living
tripod
of
Vulcan
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
living
tripod
saluted
him
as
he
passed
,
but
stopping
his
hat
on
a
*NL*
level
with
Gringoire
's
chin
,
like
a
shaving
dish
,
while
he
shouted
in
*NL*
the
latter
's
ears
:
''
_
Senor
cabellero
,
para
comprar
un
pedaso
de
pan
_
!
''
*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
Give
me
the
means
to
buy
a
bit
of
bread
,
sir
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
appears
,
''
said
Gringoire
,
``
that
this
one
can
also
talk
;
but
't
is
a
*NL*
rude
language
,
and
he
is
more
fortunate
than
I
if
he
understands
it
.
''
*NL*
Then
,
smiting
his
brow
,
in
a
sudden
transition
of
ideas
:
``
By
the
way
,
*NL*
what
the
deuce
did
they
mean
this
morning
with
their
Esmeralda
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
minded
to
augment
his
pace
,
but
for
the
third
time
something
*NL*
barred
his
way
.
This
something
or
,
rather
,
some
one
was
a
blind
man
,
a
*NL*
little
blind
fellow
with
a
bearded
,
Jewish
face
,
who
,
rowing
away
in
the
*NL*
space
about
him
with
a
stick
,
and
towed
by
a
large
dog
,
droned
through
*NL*
his
nose
with
a
Hungarian
accent
:
''
_
Facitote
caritatem
_
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
now
,
''
said
Gringoire
,
``
here
's
one
at
last
who
speaks
a
Christian
*NL*
tongue
.
I
must
have
a
very
charitable
aspect
,
since
they
ask
alms
of
*NL*
me
in
the
present
lean
condition
of
my
purse
.
My
friend
,
''
and
he
turned
*NL*
towards
the
blind
man
,
``
I
sold
my
last
shirt
last
week
;
that
is
to
say
,
*NL*
since
you
understand
only
the
language
of
Cicero
:
_
Vendidi
hebdomade
*NL*
nuper
transita
meam
ultimam
chemisan
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
said
,
he
turned
his
back
upon
the
blind
man
,
and
pursued
his
way
.
*NL*
But
the
blind
man
began
to
increase
his
stride
at
the
same
time
;
and
,
*NL*
behold
!
the
cripple
and
the
legless
man
,
in
his
bowl
,
came
up
on
their
*NL*
side
in
great
haste
,
and
with
great
clamor
of
bowl
and
crutches
,
upon
*NL*
the
pavement
.
Then
all
three
,
jostling
each
other
at
poor
Gringoire
's
*NL*
heels
,
began
to
sing
their
song
to
him
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Caritatem
_
!
''
chanted
the
blind
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
La
buona
mancia
_
!
''
chanted
the
cripple
in
the
bowl
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
lame
man
took
up
the
musical
phrase
by
repeating
:
''
_
Un
pedaso
de
*NL*
pan
_
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gringoire
stopped
up
his
ears
.
``
Oh
,
tower
of
Babel
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
set
out
to
run
.
The
blind
man
ran
!
The
lame
man
ran
!
The
cripple
in
*NL*
the
bowl
ran
!
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
,
in
proportion
as
he
plunged
deeper
into
the
street
,
cripples
*NL*
in
bowls
,
blind
men
and
lame
men
,
swarmed
about
him
,
and
men
with
one
*NL*
arm
,
and
with
one
eye
,
and
the
leprous
with
their
sores
,
some
emerging
*NL*
from
little
streets
adjacent
,
some
from
the
air-holes
of
cellars
,
*NL*
howling
,
bellowing
,
yelping
,
all
limping
and
halting
,
all
flinging
*NL*
themselves
towards
the
light
,
and
humped
up
in
the
mire
,
like
snails
*NL*
after
a
shower
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gringoire
,
still
followed
by
his
three
persecutors
,
and
not
knowing
*NL*
very
well
what
was
to
become
of
him
,
marched
along
in
terror
among
them
,
*NL*
turning
out
for
the
lame
,
stepping
over
the
cripples
in
bowls
,
with
his
*NL*
feet
imbedded
in
that
ant-hill
of
lame
men
,
like
the
English
captain
who
*NL*
got
caught
in
the
quicksand
of
a
swarm
of
crabs
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
idea
occurred
to
him
of
making
an
effort
to
retrace
his
steps
.
But
*NL*
it
was
too
late
.
This
whole
legion
had
closed
in
behind
him
,
and
his
*NL*
three
beggars
held
him
fast
.
So
he
proceeded
,
impelled
both
by
this
*NL*
irresistible
flood
,
by
fear
,
and
by
a
vertigo
which
converted
all
this
*NL*
into
a
sort
of
horrible
dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
he
reached
the
end
of
the
street
.
It
opened
upon
an
immense
*NL*
place
,
where
a
thousand
scattered
lights
flickered
in
the
confused
mists
*NL*
of
night
.
Gringoire
flew
thither
,
hoping
to
escape
,
by
the
swiftness
of
*NL*
his
legs
,
from
the
three
infirm
spectres
who
had
clutched
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Onde
vas
,
hombre
_
?
''
-LRB-
Where
are
you
going
,
my
man
?
-RRB-
cried
the
cripple
,
*NL*
flinging
away
his
crutches
,
and
running
after
him
with
the
best
legs
*NL*
that
ever
traced
a
geometrical
step
upon
the
pavements
of
Paris
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
the
legless
man
,
erect
upon
his
feet
,
crowned
Gringoire
*NL*
with
his
heavy
iron
bowl
,
and
the
blind
man
glared
in
his
face
with
*NL*
flaming
eyes
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
am
I
?
''
said
the
terrified
poet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
Court
of
Miracles
,
''
replied
a
fourth
spectre
,
who
had
accosted
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
soul
,
''
resumed
Gringoire
,
``
I
certainly
do
behold
the
blind
who
*NL*
see
,
and
the
lame
who
walk
,
but
where
is
the
Saviour
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
replied
by
a
burst
of
sinister
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
poet
cast
his
eyes
about
him
.
It
was
,
in
truth
,
that
*NL*
redoubtable
Cour
des
Miracles
,
whither
an
honest
man
had
never
*NL*
penetrated
at
such
an
hour
;
the
magic
circle
where
the
officers
of
the
*NL*
Chatelet
and
the
sergeants
of
the
provostship
,
who
ventured
thither
,
*NL*
disappeared
in
morsels
;
a
city
of
thieves
,
a
hideous
wart
on
the
face
of
*NL*
Paris
;
a
sewer
,
from
which
escaped
every
morning
,
and
whither
returned
*NL*
every
night
to
crouch
,
that
stream
of
vices
,
of
mendicancy
and
*NL*
vagabondage
which
always
overflows
in
the
streets
of
capitals
;
a
*NL*
monstrous
hive
,
to
which
returned
at
nightfall
,
with
their
booty
,
all
*NL*
the
drones
of
the
social
order
;
a
lying
hospital
where
the
bohemian
,
the
*NL*
disfrocked
monk
,
the
ruined
scholar
,
the
ne'er
-
do-wells
of
all
nations
,
*NL*
Spaniards
,
Italians
,
Germans
,
--
of
all
religions
,
Jews
,
Christians
,
*NL*
Mahometans
,
idolaters
,
covered
with
painted
sores
,
beggars
by
day
,
were
*NL*
transformed
by
night
into
brigands
;
an
immense
dressing-room
,
in
a
word
,
*NL*
where
,
at
that
epoch
,
the
actors
of
that
eternal
comedy
,
which
theft
,
*NL*
prostitution
,
and
murder
play
upon
the
pavements
of
Paris
,
dressed
and
*NL*
undressed
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
vast
place
,
irregular
and
badly
paved
,
like
all
the
squares
of
*NL*
Paris
at
that
date
.
Fires
,
around
which
swarmed
strange
groups
,
blazed
*NL*
here
and
there
.
Every
one
was
going
,
coming
,
and
shouting
.
Shrill
*NL*
laughter
was
to
be
heard
,
the
wailing
of
children
,
the
voices
of
*NL*
women
.
The
hands
and
heads
of
this
throng
,
black
against
the
luminous
*NL*
background
,
outlined
against
it
a
thousand
eccentric
gestures
.
At
times
,
*NL*
upon
the
ground
,
where
trembled
the
light
of
the
fires
,
mingled
with
*NL*
large
,
indefinite
shadows
,
one
could
behold
a
dog
passing
,
which
*NL*
resembled
a
man
,
a
man
who
resembled
a
dog
.
The
limits
of
races
and
*NL*
species
seemed
effaced
in
this
city
,
as
in
a
pandemonium
.
Men
,
women
,
*NL*
beasts
,
age
,
sex
,
health
,
maladies
,
all
seemed
to
be
in
common
among
*NL*
these
people
;
all
went
together
,
they
mingled
,
confounded
,
superposed
;
*NL*
each
one
there
participated
in
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
and
flickering
flames
of
the
fire
permitted
Gringoire
to
*NL*
distinguish
,
amid
his
trouble
,
all
around
the
immense
place
,
a
hideous
*NL*
frame
of
ancient
houses
,
whose
wormeaten
,
shrivelled
,
stunted
facades
,
*NL*
each
pierced
with
one
or
two
lighted
attic
windows
,
seemed
to
him
,
in
*NL*
the
darkness
,
like
enormous
heads
of
old
women
,
ranged
in
a
circle
,
*NL*
monstrous
and
crabbed
,
winking
as
they
looked
on
at
the
Witches
'
*NL*
Sabbath
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
like
a
new
world
,
unknown
,
unheard
of
,
misshapen
,
creeping
,
*NL*
swarming
,
fantastic
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gringoire
,
more
and
more
terrified
,
clutched
by
the
three
beggars
as
by
*NL*
three
pairs
of
tongs
,
dazed
by
a
throng
of
other
faces
which
frothed
and
*NL*
yelped
around
him
,
unhappy
Gringoire
endeavored
to
summon
his
presence
*NL*
of
mind
,
in
order
to
recall
whether
it
was
a
Saturday
.
But
his
efforts
*NL*
were
vain
;
the
thread
of
his
memory
and
of
his
thought
was
broken
;
and
,
*NL*
doubting
everything
,
wavering
between
what
he
saw
and
what
he
felt
,
he
*NL*
put
to
himself
this
unanswerable
question
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
exist
,
does
this
exist
?
if
this
exists
,
do
I
exist
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
,
a
distinct
cry
arose
in
the
buzzing
throng
which
*NL*
surrounded
him
,
``
Let
's
take
him
to
the
king
!
let
's
take
him
to
the
*NL*
king
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Holy
Virgin
!
''
murmured
Gringoire
,
``
the
king
here
must
be
a
ram
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
king
!
to
the
king
!
''
repeated
all
voices
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
dragged
him
off
.
Each
vied
with
the
other
in
laying
his
claws
upon
*NL*
him
.
But
the
three
beggars
did
not
loose
their
hold
and
tore
him
from
*NL*
the
rest
,
howling
,
``
He
belongs
to
us
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
poet
's
already
sickly
doublet
yielded
its
last
sigh
in
this
*NL*
struggle
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
traversing
the
horrible
place
,
his
vertigo
vanished
.
After
taking
*NL*
a
few
steps
,
the
sentiment
of
reality
returned
to
him
.
He
began
to
*NL*
become
accustomed
to
the
atmosphere
of
the
place
.
At
the
first
moment
*NL*
there
had
arisen
from
his
poet
's
head
,
or
,
simply
and
prosaically
,
*NL*
from
his
empty
stomach
,
a
mist
,
a
vapor
,
so
to
speak
,
which
,
spreading
*NL*
between
objects
and
himself
,
permitted
him
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
them
*NL*
only
in
the
incoherent
fog
of
nightmare
,
--
in
those
shadows
of
dreams
*NL*
which
distort
every
outline
,
agglomerating
objects
into
unwieldy
groups
,
*NL*
dilating
things
into
chimeras
,
and
men
into
phantoms
.
Little
by
little
,
*NL*
this
hallucination
was
succeeded
by
a
less
bewildered
and
exaggerating
*NL*
view
.
Reality
made
its
way
to
the
light
around
him
,
struck
his
eyes
,
*NL*
struck
his
feet
,
and
demolished
,
bit
by
bit
,
all
that
frightful
poetry
*NL*
with
which
he
had
,
at
first
,
believed
himself
to
be
surrounded
.
He
was
*NL*
forced
to
perceive
that
he
was
not
walking
in
the
Styx
,
but
in
mud
,
that
*NL*
he
was
elbowed
not
by
demons
,
but
by
thieves
;
that
it
was
not
his
soul
*NL*
which
was
in
question
,
but
his
life
-LRB-
since
he
lacked
that
precious
*NL*
conciliator
,
which
places
itself
so
effectually
between
the
bandit
and
*NL*
the
honest
man
--
a
purse
-RRB-
.
In
short
,
on
examining
the
orgy
more
closely
,
*NL*
and
with
more
coolness
,
he
fell
from
the
witches
'
sabbath
to
the
*NL*
dram-shop
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Cour
des
Miracles
was
,
in
fact
,
merely
a
dram-shop
;
but
a
brigand
's
*NL*
dram-shop
,
reddened
quite
as
much
with
blood
as
with
wine
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
spectacle
which
presented
itself
to
his
eyes
,
when
his
ragged
escort
*NL*
finally
deposited
him
at
the
end
of
his
trip
,
was
not
fitted
to
bear
him
*NL*
back
to
poetry
,
even
to
the
poetry
of
hell
.
It
was
more
than
ever
the
*NL*
prosaic
and
brutal
reality
of
the
tavern
.
Were
we
not
in
the
fifteenth
*NL*
century
,
we
would
say
that
Gringoire
had
descended
from
Michael
Angelo
*NL*
to
Callot
.
*NL*
*NL*
Around
a
great
fire
which
burned
on
a
large
,
circular
flagstone
,
the
*NL*
flames
of
which
had
heated
red-hot
the
legs
of
a
tripod
,
which
was
*NL*
empty
for
the
moment
,
some
wormeaten
tables
were
placed
,
here
and
there
,
*NL*
haphazard
,
no
lackey
of
a
geometrical
turn
having
deigned
to
adjust
*NL*
their
parallelism
,
or
to
see
to
it
that
they
did
not
make
too
unusual
*NL*
angles
.
Upon
these
tables
gleamed
several
dripping
pots
of
wine
and
*NL*
beer
,
and
round
these
pots
were
grouped
many
bacchic
visages
,
purple
*NL*
with
the
fire
and
the
wine
.
There
was
a
man
with
a
huge
belly
and
a
*NL*
jovial
face
,
noisily
kissing
a
woman
of
the
town
,
thickset
and
brawny
.
*NL*
There
was
a
sort
of
sham
soldier
,
a
``
naquois
,
''
as
the
slang
expression
*NL*
runs
,
who
was
whistling
as
he
undid
the
bandages
from
his
fictitious
*NL*
wound
,
and
removing
the
numbness
from
his
sound
and
vigorous
knee
,
which
*NL*
had
been
swathed
since
morning
in
a
thousand
ligatures
.
On
the
other
*NL*
hand
,
there
was
a
wretched
fellow
,
preparing
with
celandine
and
beef
's
*NL*
blood
,
his
``
leg
of
God
,
''
for
the
next
day
.
Two
tables
further
on
,
a
*NL*
palmer
,
with
his
pilgrim
's
costume
complete
,
was
practising
the
lament
*NL*
of
the
Holy
Queen
,
not
forgetting
the
drone
and
the
nasal
drawl
.
Further
*NL*
on
,
a
young
scamp
was
taking
a
lesson
in
epilepsy
from
an
old
pretender
,
*NL*
who
was
instructing
him
in
the
art
of
foaming
at
the
mouth
,
by
chewing
a
*NL*
morsel
of
soap
.
Beside
him
,
a
man
with
the
dropsy
was
getting
rid
of
his
*NL*
swelling
,
and
making
four
or
five
female
thieves
,
who
were
disputing
*NL*
at
the
same
table
,
over
a
child
who
had
been
stolen
that
evening
,
hold
*NL*
their
noses
.
All
circumstances
which
,
two
centuries
later
,
``
seemed
so
*NL*
ridiculous
to
the
court
,
''
as
Sauval
says
,
``
that
they
served
as
a
pastime
*NL*
to
the
king
,
and
as
an
introduction
to
the
royal
ballet
of
Night
,
*NL*
divided
into
four
parts
and
danced
on
the
theatre
of
the
Petit-Bourbon
.
''
*NL*
``
Never
,
''
adds
an
eye
witness
of
1653
,
``
have
the
sudden
metamorphoses
of
*NL*
the
Court
of
Miracles
been
more
happily
presented
.
Benserade
prepared
us
*NL*
for
it
by
some
very
gallant
verses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Loud
laughter
everywhere
,
and
obscene
songs
.
Each
one
held
his
own
*NL*
course
,
carping
and
swearing
,
without
listening
to
his
neighbor
.
Pots
*NL*
clinked
,
and
quarrels
sprang
up
at
the
shock
of
the
pots
,
and
the
broken
*NL*
pots
made
rents
in
the
rags
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
big
dog
,
seated
on
his
tail
,
gazed
at
the
fire
.
Some
children
were
*NL*
mingled
in
this
orgy
.
The
stolen
child
wept
and
cried
.
Another
,
a
big
*NL*
boy
four
years
of
age
,
seated
with
legs
dangling
,
upon
a
bench
that
was
*NL*
too
high
for
him
,
before
a
table
that
reached
to
his
chin
,
and
uttering
*NL*
not
a
word
.
A
third
,
gravely
spreading
out
upon
the
table
with
his
*NL*
finger
,
the
melted
tallow
which
dripped
from
a
candle
.
Last
of
all
,
a
*NL*
little
fellow
crouching
in
the
mud
,
almost
lost
in
a
cauldron
,
which
*NL*
he
was
scraping
with
a
tile
,
and
from
which
he
was
evoking
a
sound
that
*NL*
would
have
made
Stradivarius
swoon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Near
the
fire
was
a
hogshead
,
and
on
the
hogshead
a
beggar
.
This
was
the
*NL*
king
on
his
throne
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
three
who
had
Gringoire
in
their
clutches
led
him
in
front
of
this
*NL*
hogshead
,
and
the
entire
bacchanal
rout
fell
silent
for
a
moment
,
with
*NL*
the
exception
of
the
cauldron
inhabited
by
the
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gringoire
dared
neither
breathe
nor
raise
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Hombre
,
quita
tu
sombrero
_
!
''
said
one
of
the
three
knaves
,
in
whose
*NL*
grasp
he
was
,
and
,
before
he
had
comprehended
the
meaning
,
the
other
had
*NL*
snatched
his
hat
--
a
wretched
headgear
,
it
is
true
,
but
still
good
on
a
*NL*
sunny
day
or
when
there
was
but
little
rain
.
Gringoire
sighed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
the
king
addressed
him
,
from
the
summit
of
his
cask
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
this
rogue
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gringoire
shuddered
.
That
voice
,
although
accentuated
by
menace
,
*NL*
recalled
to
him
another
voice
,
which
,
that
very
morning
,
had
dealt
the
*NL*
deathblow
to
his
mystery
,
by
drawling
,
nasally
,
in
the
midst
of
the
*NL*
audience
,
``
Charity
,
please
!
''
He
raised
his
head
.
It
was
indeed
Clopin
*NL*
Trouillefou
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clopin
Trouillefou
,
arrayed
in
his
royal
insignia
,
wore
neither
one
rag
*NL*
more
nor
one
rag
less
.
The
sore
upon
his
arm
had
already
disappeared
.
*NL*
He
held
in
his
hand
one
of
those
whips
made
of
thongs
of
white
leather
,
*NL*
which
police
sergeants
then
used
to
repress
the
crowd
,
and
which
were
*NL*
called
_
boullayes
_
.
On
his
head
he
wore
a
sort
of
headgear
,
bound
round
*NL*
and
closed
at
the
top
.
But
it
was
difficult
to
make
out
whether
it
was
*NL*
a
child
's
cap
or
a
king
's
crown
,
the
two
things
bore
so
strong
a
*NL*
resemblance
to
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
Gringoire
,
without
knowing
why
,
had
regained
some
hope
,
on
*NL*
recognizing
in
the
King
of
the
Cour
des
Miracles
his
accursed
mendicant
*NL*
of
the
Grand
Hall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Master
,
''
stammered
he
;
``
monseigneur
--
sire
--
how
ought
I
to
address
*NL*
you
?
''
he
said
at
length
,
having
reached
the
culminating
point
of
his
*NL*
crescendo
,
and
knowing
neither
how
to
mount
higher
,
nor
to
descend
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monseigneur
,
his
majesty
,
or
comrade
,
call
me
what
you
please
.
But
make
*NL*
haste
.
What
have
you
to
say
in
your
own
defence
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
your
own
defence
?
''
thought
Gringoire
,
``
that
displeases
me
.
''
He
*NL*
resumed
,
stuttering
,
``
I
am
he
,
who
this
morning
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
devil
's
claws
!
''
interrupted
Clopin
,
``
your
name
,
knave
,
and
*NL*
nothing
more
.
Listen
.
You
are
in
the
presence
of
three
powerful
*NL*
sovereigns
:
myself
,
Clopin
Trouillefou
,
King
of
Thunes
,
successor
to
the
*NL*
Grand
Coesre
,
supreme
suzerain
of
the
Realm
of
Argot
;
Mathias
Hunyadi
*NL*
Spicali
,
Duke
of
Egypt
and
of
Bohemia
,
the
old
yellow
fellow
whom
*NL*
you
see
yonder
,
with
a
dish
clout
round
his
head
;
Guillaume
Rousseau
,
*NL*
Emperor
of
Galilee
,
that
fat
fellow
who
is
not
listening
to
us
but
*NL*
caressing
a
wench
.
We
are
your
judges
.
You
have
entered
the
Kingdom
of
*NL*
Argot
,
without
being
an
_
argotier
_
;
you
have
violated
the
privileges
of
*NL*
our
city
.
You
must
be
punished
unless
you
are
a
_
capon
_
,
a
_
franc-mitou
_
*NL*
or
a
_
rifode
_
;
that
is
to
say
,
in
the
slang
of
honest
folks
,
--
a
thief
,
a
*NL*
beggar
,
or
a
vagabond
.
Are
you
anything
of
that
sort
?
Justify
yourself
;
*NL*
announce
your
titles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
!
''
said
Gringoire
,
``
I
have
not
that
honor
.
I
am
the
author
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
sufficient
,
''
resumed
Trouillefou
,
without
permitting
him
*NL*
to
finish
.
``
You
are
going
to
be
hanged
.
'T
is
a
very
simple
matter
,
*NL*
gentlemen
and
honest
bourgeois
!
as
you
treat
our
people
in
your
abode
,
*NL*
so
we
treat
you
in
ours
!
The
law
which
you
apply
to
vagabonds
,
vagabonds
*NL*
apply
to
you
.
'T
is
your
fault
if
it
is
harsh
.
One
really
must
behold
*NL*
the
grimace
of
an
honest
man
above
the
hempen
collar
now
and
then
;
that
*NL*
renders
the
thing
honorable
.
Come
,
friend
,
divide
your
rags
gayly
among
*NL*
these
damsels
.
I
am
going
to
have
you
hanged
to
amuse
the
vagabonds
,
and
*NL*
you
are
to
give
them
your
purse
to
drink
your
health
.
If
you
have
any
*NL*
mummery
to
go
through
with
,
there
's
a
very
good
God
the
Father
in
that
*NL*
mortar
yonder
,
in
stone
,
which
we
stole
from
Saint-Pierre
aux
Boeufs
.
*NL*
You
have
four
minutes
in
which
to
fling
your
soul
at
his
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
harangue
was
formidable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
said
,
upon
my
soul
!
Clopin
Trouillefou
preaches
like
the
Holy
*NL*
Father
the
Pope
!
''
exclaimed
the
Emperor
of
Galilee
,
smashing
his
pot
in
*NL*
order
to
prop
up
his
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Messeigneurs
,
emperors
,
and
kings
,
''
said
Gringoire
coolly
-LRB-
for
I
know
*NL*
not
how
,
firmness
had
returned
to
him
,
and
he
spoke
with
resolution
-RRB-
,
*NL*
``
do
n't
think
of
such
a
thing
;
my
name
is
Pierre
Gringoire
.
I
am
the
*NL*
poet
whose
morality
was
presented
this
morning
in
the
grand
hall
of
the
*NL*
Courts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
so
it
was
you
,
master
!
''
said
Clopin
.
``
I
was
there
,
_
xete
Dieu
_
!
*NL*
Well
!
comrade
,
is
that
any
reason
,
because
you
bored
us
to
death
this
*NL*
morning
,
that
you
should
not
be
hung
this
evening
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
find
difficulty
in
getting
out
of
it
,
''
said
Gringoire
to
*NL*
himself
.
Nevertheless
,
he
made
one
more
effort
:
``
I
do
n't
see
why
poets
*NL*
are
not
classed
with
vagabonds
,
''
said
he
.
``
Vagabond
,
Aesopus
certainly
*NL*
was
;
Homerus
was
a
beggar
;
Mercurius
was
a
thief
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Clopin
interrupted
him
:
``
I
believe
that
you
are
trying
to
blarney
us
*NL*
with
your
jargon
.
Zounds
!
let
yourself
be
hung
,
and
do
n't
kick
up
such
a
*NL*
row
over
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
me
,
monseigneur
,
the
King
of
Thunes
,
''
replied
Gringoire
,
*NL*
disputing
the
ground
foot
by
foot
.
``
It
is
worth
trouble
--
One
*NL*
moment
!
--
Listen
to
me
--
You
are
not
going
to
condemn
me
without
having
*NL*
heard
me
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
His
unlucky
voice
was
,
in
fact
,
drowned
in
the
uproar
which
rose
around
*NL*
him
.
The
little
boy
scraped
away
at
his
cauldron
with
more
spirit
than
*NL*
ever
;
and
,
to
crown
all
,
an
old
woman
had
just
placed
on
the
tripod
a
*NL*
frying-pan
of
grease
,
which
hissed
away
on
the
fire
with
a
noise
similar
*NL*
to
the
cry
of
a
troop
of
children
in
pursuit
of
a
masker
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
Clopin
Trouillefou
appeared
to
hold
a
momentary
*NL*
conference
with
the
Duke
of
Egypt
,
and
the
Emperor
of
Galilee
,
who
*NL*
was
completely
drunk
.
Then
he
shouted
shrilly
:
``
Silence
!
''
and
,
as
the
*NL*
cauldron
and
the
frying-pan
did
not
heed
him
,
and
continued
their
duet
,
*NL*
he
jumped
down
from
his
hogshead
,
gave
a
kick
to
the
boiler
,
which
*NL*
rolled
ten
paces
away
bearing
the
child
with
it
,
a
kick
to
the
*NL*
frying-pan
,
which
upset
in
the
fire
with
all
its
grease
,
and
gravely
*NL*
remounted
his
throne
,
without
troubling
himself
about
the
stifled
*NL*
tears
of
the
child
,
or
the
grumbling
of
the
old
woman
,
whose
supper
was
*NL*
wasting
away
in
a
fine
white
flame
.
*NL*
*NL*
Trouillefou
made
a
sign
,
and
the
duke
,
the
emperor
,
and
the
passed
*NL*
masters
of
pickpockets
,
and
the
isolated
robbers
,
came
and
ranged
*NL*
themselves
around
him
in
a
horseshoe
,
of
which
Gringoire
,
still
roughly
*NL*
held
by
the
body
,
formed
the
centre
.
It
was
a
semicircle
of
rags
,
*NL*
tatters
,
tinsel
,
pitchforks
,
axes
,
legs
staggering
with
intoxication
,
*NL*
huge
,
bare
arms
,
faces
sordid
,
dull
,
and
stupid
.
In
the
midst
of
this
*NL*
Round
Table
of
beggary
,
Clopin
Trouillefou
,
--
as
the
doge
of
this
senate
,
*NL*
as
the
king
of
this
peerage
,
as
the
pope
of
this
conclave
,
--
dominated
;
*NL*
first
by
virtue
of
the
height
of
his
hogshead
,
and
next
by
virtue
of
*NL*
an
indescribable
,
haughty
,
fierce
,
and
formidable
air
,
which
caused
his
*NL*
eyes
to
flash
,
and
corrected
in
his
savage
profile
the
bestial
type
of
*NL*
the
race
of
vagabonds
.
One
would
have
pronounced
him
a
boar
amid
a
herd
*NL*
of
swine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
''
said
he
to
Gringoire
,
fondling
his
misshapen
chin
with
his
*NL*
horny
hand
;
``
I
do
n't
see
why
you
should
not
be
hung
.
It
is
true
that
*NL*
it
appears
to
be
repugnant
to
you
;
and
it
is
very
natural
,
for
you
*NL*
bourgeois
are
not
accustomed
to
it
.
You
form
for
yourselves
a
great
idea
*NL*
of
the
thing
.
After
all
,
we
do
n't
wish
you
any
harm
.
Here
is
a
means
*NL*
of
extricating
yourself
from
your
predicament
for
the
moment
.
Will
you
*NL*
become
one
of
us
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
can
judge
of
the
effect
which
this
proposition
produced
upon
*NL*
Gringoire
,
who
beheld
life
slipping
away
from
him
,
and
who
was
beginning
*NL*
to
lose
his
hold
upon
it
.
He
clutched
at
it
again
with
energy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
I
will
,
and
right
heartily
,
''
said

Gringoire

Just

Gringoire

*NL*

There
are

*NL*
*NL*

So

the

scowled

;
I

*NL*
Cut-throat

yes
;
cutpurse

no

''
*NL*
*NL*
Gringoire
tried
to
slip
in
some
excuse
between
these
curt
words
,
which
*NL*
wrath
rendered
more
and
more
jerky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ask
your
pardon
,
monseigneur
.
It
is
not
Hebrew
;
't
is
Latin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
,
''
resumed
Clopin
angrily
,
``
that
I
'm
not
a
Jew
,
and
that
I
'll
*NL*
have
you
hung
,
belly
of
the
synagogue
,
like
that
little
shopkeeper
of
*NL*
Judea
,
who
is
by
your
side
,
and
whom
I
entertain
strong
hopes
of
seeing
*NL*
nailed
to
a
counter
one
of
these
days
,
like
the
counterfeit
coin
that
he
*NL*
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
he
pointed
his
finger
at
the
little
,
bearded
Hungarian
Jew
*NL*
who
had
accosted
Gringoire
with
his
_
facitote
caritatem
_
,
and
who
,
*NL*
understanding
no
other
language
beheld
with
surprise
the
King
of
*NL*
Thunes
's
ill-humor
overflow
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
Monsieur
Clopin
calmed
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
will
be
a
vagabond
,
you
knave
?
''
he
said
to
our
poet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
''
replied
the
poet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Willing
is
not
all
,
''
said
the
surly
Clopin
;
``
good
will
does
n't
put
one
*NL*
onion
the
more
into
the
soup

't
is
good

nothing
except
to
go
*NL*
to
Paradise
with
;
now
,
Paradise
and
the
thieves
'
band
are
two
different
*NL*
things
.
In
order
to
be
received
among
the
thieves
,
*
you
must
prove
that
*NL*
you
are
good
for
something
,
and
for
that
purpose
,
you
must
search
the
*NL*
manikin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
L'argot
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
search
anything
you
like
,
''
said
Gringoire
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clopin
made
a
sign
.
Several
thieves
detached
themselves
from
the
circle
,
*NL*
and
returned
a
moment
later
.
They
brought
two
thick
posts
,
terminated
*NL*
at
their
lower
extremities
in
spreading
timber
supports
,
which
made
them
*NL*
stand
readily
upon
the
ground
;
to
the
upper
extremity
of
the
two
posts
*NL*
they
fitted
a
cross-beam
,
and
the
whole
constituted
a
very
pretty
*NL*
portable
gibbet
,
which
Gringoire
had
the
satisfaction
of
beholding
rise
*NL*
before
him
,
in
a
twinkling
.
Nothing
was
lacking
,
not
even
the
rope
,
*NL*
which
swung
gracefully
over
the
cross-beam
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
they
going
to
do
?
''
Gringoire
asked
himself
with
some
*NL*
uneasiness
.
A
sound
of
bells
,
which
he
heard
at
that
moment
,
put
an
*NL*
end
to
his
anxiety
;
it
was
a
stuffed
manikin
,
which
the
vagabonds
were
*NL*
suspending
by
the
neck
from
the
rope
,
a
sort
of
scarecrow
dressed
in
*NL*
red
,
and
so
hung
with
mule-bells
and
larger
bells
,
that
one
might
have
*NL*
tricked
out
thirty
Castilian
mules
with
them
.
These
thousand
tiny
bells
*NL*
quivered
for
some
time
with
the
vibration
of
the
rope
,
then
gradually
*NL*
died
away
,
and
finally
became
silent
when
the
manikin
had
been
brought
*NL*
into
a
state
of
immobility
by
that
law
of
the
pendulum
which
has
*NL*
dethroned
the
water
clock
and
the
hour-glass
.
Then
Clopin
,
pointing
out
*NL*
to
Gringoire
a
rickety
old
stool
placed
beneath
the
manikin
,
--
``
Climb
up
*NL*
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Death
of
the
devil
!
''
objected
Gringoire
;
``
I
shall
break
my
neck
.
Your
*NL*
stool
limps
like
one
of
Martial
's
distiches
;
it
has
one
hexameter
leg
*NL*
and
one
pentameter
leg
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Climb
!
''
repeated
Clopin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gringoire
mounted
the
stool
,
and
succeeded
,
not
without
some
*NL*
oscillations
of
head
and
arms
,
in
regaining
his
centre
of
gravity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
went
on
the
King
of
Thunes
,
``
twist
your
right
foot
round
your
*NL*
left
leg
,
and
rise
on
the
tip
of
your
left
foot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monseigneur
,
''
said
Gringoire
,
``
so
you
absolutely
insist
on
my
breaking
*NL*
some
one
of
my
limbs
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Clopin
tossed
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hark
ye
,
my
friend
,
you
talk
too
much
.
Here
's
the
gist
of
the
matter
*NL*
in
two
words
:
you
are
to
rise
on
tiptoe
,
as
I
tell
you
;
in
that
way
you
*NL*
will
be
able
to
reach
the
pocket
of
the
manikin
,
you
will
rummage
it
,
*NL*
you
will
pull
out
the
purse
that
is
there
,
--
and
if
you
do
all
this
*NL*
without
our
hearing
the
sound
of
a
bell
,
all
is
well
:
you
shall
be
a
*NL*
vagabond
.
All
we
shall
then
have
to
do
,
will
be
to
thrash
you
soundly
*NL*
for
the
space
of
a
week
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Ventre-Dieu
_
!
I
will
be
careful
,
''
said
Gringoire
.
``
And
suppose
I
do
*NL*
make
the
bells
sound
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
will
be
hanged
.
Do
you
understand
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
at
all
,
''
replied
Gringoire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
once
more
.
You
are
to
search
the
manikin
,
and
take
away
its
*NL*
purse
;
if
a
single
bell
stirs
during
the
operation
,
you
will
be
hung
.
Do
*NL*
you
understand
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
,
''
said
Gringoire
;
``
I
understand
that
.
And
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
succeed
in
removing
the
purse
without
our
hearing
the
bells
,
you
*NL*
are
a
vagabond
,
and
you
will
be
thrashed
for
eight
consecutive
days
.
You
*NL*
understand
now
,
no
doubt
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
monseigneur
;
I
no
longer
understand
.
Where
is
the
advantage
to
me
?
*NL*
hanged
in
one
case
,
cudgelled
in
the
other
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
a
vagabond
,
''
resumed
Clopin
,
``
and
a
vagabond
;
is
that
nothing
?
It
*NL*
is
for
your
interest
that
we
should
beat
you
,
in
order
to
harden
you
to
*NL*
blows
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Many
thanks
,
''
replied
the
poet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
make
haste
,
''
said
the
king
,
stamping
upon
his
cask
,
which
*NL*
resounded
like
a
huge
drum
!
``
Search
the
manikin
,
and
let
there
be
an
end
*NL*
to
this
!
I
warn
you
for
the
last
time
,
that
if
I
hear
a
single
bell
,
you
*NL*
will
take
the
place
of
the
manikin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
band
of
thieves
applauded
Clopin
's
words
,
and
arranged
themselves
*NL*
in
a
circle
round
the
gibbet
,
with
a
laugh
so
pitiless
that
Gringoire
*NL*
perceived
that
he
amused
them
too
much
not
to
have
everything
to
fear
*NL*
from
them
.
No
hope
was
left
for
him
,
accordingly
,
unless
it
were
the
*NL*
slight
chance
of
succeeding
in
the
formidable
operation
which
was
*NL*
imposed
upon
him
;
he
decided
to
risk
it
,
but
it
was
not
without
first
*NL*
having
addressed
a
fervent
prayer
to
the
manikin
he
was
about
to
*NL*
plunder
,
and
who
would
have
been
easier
to
move
to
pity
than
the
*NL*
vagabonds
.
These
myriad
bells
,
with
their
little
copper
tongues
,
seemed
*NL*
to
him
like
the
mouths
of
so
many
asps
,
open
and
ready
to
sting
and
to
*NL*
hiss
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
he
said
,
in
a
very
low
voice
,
``
is
it
possible
that
my
life
depends
*NL*
on
the
slightest
vibration
of
the
least
of
these
bells
?
Oh
!
''
he
added
,
*NL*
with
clasped
hands
,
``
bells
,
do
not
ring
,
hand-bells
do
not
clang
,
*NL*
mule-bells
do
not
quiver
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
one
more
attempt
upon
Trouillefou
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
if
there
should
come
a
gust
of
wind
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
be
hanged
,
''
replied
the
other
,
without
hesitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perceiving
that
no
respite
,
nor
reprieve
,
nor
subterfuge
was
possible
,
*NL*
he
bravely
decided
upon
his
course
of
action
;
he
wound
his
right
foot
*NL*
round
his
left
leg
,
raised
himself
on
his
left
foot
,
and
stretched
out
*NL*
his
arm
:
but
at
the
moment
when
his
hand
touched
the
manikin
,
his
body
,
*NL*
which
was
now
supported
upon
one
leg
only
,
wavered
on
the
stool
which
*NL*
had
but
three
;
he
made
an
involuntary
effort
to
support
himself
by
the
*NL*
manikin
,
lost
his
balance
,
and
fell
heavily
to
the
ground
,
deafened
*NL*
by
the
fatal
vibration
of
the
thousand
bells
of
the
manikin
,
which
,
*NL*
yielding
to
the
impulse
imparted
by
his
hand
,
described
first
a
rotary
*NL*
motion
,
and
then
swayed
majestically
between
the
two
posts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Malediction
!
''
he
cried
as
he
fell
,
and
remained
as
though
dead
,
with
*NL*
his
face
to
the
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
he
heard
the
dreadful
peal
above
his
head
,
the
diabolical
*NL*
laughter
of
the
vagabonds
,
and
the
voice
of
Trouillefou
saying
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pick
me
up
that
knave
,
and
hang
him
without
ceremony
.
''
He
rose
.
They
*NL*
had
already
detached
the
manikin
to
make
room
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
thieves
made
him
mount
the
stool
,
Clopin
came
to
him
,
passed
the
*NL*
rope
about
his
neck
,
and
,
tapping
him
on
the
shoulder
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Adieu
,
my
friend
.
You
ca
n't
escape
now

even
if
you
digested
with
the
*NL*
pope
's
guts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
word
``
Mercy
!
''
died
away
upon
Gringoire
's
lips
.
He
cast
his
eyes
*NL*
about
him
;
but
there
was
no
hope
:
all
were
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bellevigne
de
l'Etoile
,
''
said
the
King
of
Thunes
to
an
enormous
*NL*
vagabond
,
who
stepped
out
from
the
ranks
,
``
climb
upon
the
cross
beam
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bellevigne
de
l'Etoile
nimbly
mounted
the
transverse
beam
,
and
in
*NL*
another
minute
,
Gringoire
,
on
raising
his
eyes
,
beheld
him
,
with
terror
,
*NL*
seated
upon
the
beam
above
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
resumed
Clopin
Trouillefou
,
``
as
soon
as
I
clap
my
hands
,
you
,
*NL*
Andry
the
Red
,
will
fling
the
stool
to
the
ground
with
a
blow
of
your
*NL*
knee
;
you
,
Francois
Chante-Prune
,
will
cling
to
the
feet
of
the
rascal
;
*NL*
and
you
,
Bellevigne
,
will
fling
yourself
on
his
shoulders
;
and
all
three
*NL*
at
once
,
do
you
hear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gringoire
shuddered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
ready
?
''
said
Clopin
Trouillefou
to
the
three
thieves
,
who
held
*NL*
themselves
in
readiness
to
fall
upon
Gringoire
.
A
moment
of
horrible
*NL*
suspense
ensued
for
the
poor
victim
,
during
which
Clopin
tranquilly
*NL*
thrust
into
the
fire
with
the
tip
of
his
foot
,
some
bits
of
vine
shoots
*NL*
which
the
flame
had
not
caught
.
``
Are
you
ready
?
''
he
repeated
,
and
opened
*NL*
his
hands
to
clap
.
One
second
more
and
all
would
have
been
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
paused
,
as
though
struck
by
a
sudden
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
moment
!
''
said
he
;
``
I

It
is

a

without
inquiring
whether
there

wants
him

Comrade

*NL*
this
is

This
law
of
the
vagabonds
,
singular
as
it
may
strike
the
reader
,
remains
*NL*
to-day
written
out
at
length
,
in
ancient
English
legislation

*NL*
Gringoire
breathed
again
.
This
was
the
second
time
that
he
had
*NL*
returned
to
life
within
an
hour
.
So
he
did
not
dare
to
trust
to
it
too
*NL*
implicitly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hola
!
''
cried
Clopin
,
mounted
once
more
upon
his
cask
,
``
hola
!
women
,
*NL*
females

is
there
among
you
,
from
the

Come
and

A
man
for
nothing
!
Who
wants
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gringoire
,
no
doubt
,
was
not
very
appetizing
in
this
miserable
*NL*
condition
.
The
female
vagabonds
did
not
seem
to
be
much
affected
by
the
*NL*
proposition
.
The
unhappy
wretch
heard
them
answer
:
``
No
!
no
!
hang
him
;
*NL*
there
'll
be
the
more
fun
for
us
all
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
three
emerged
from
the
throng
and
came
to
smell
of
*NL*
him
.
The
first
was
a
big
wench
,
with
a
square
face
.
She
examined
the
*NL*
philosopher
's
deplorable
doublet
attentively
.
His
garment
was
worn
,
and
*NL*
more
full
of
holes
than
a
stove
for
roasting
chestnuts
.
The
girl
made
a
*NL*
wry
face
.
``
Old
rag
!
''
she
muttered
,
and
addressing
Gringoire
,
``
Let
's
see
*NL*
your
cloak
!
''
``
I
have
lost
it
,
''
replied
Gringoire
.
``
Your
hat
?
''
``
They
took
*NL*
it
away
from
me
.
''
``
Your
shoes
?
''
``
They
have
hardly
any
soles
left
.
''
``
Your
*NL*
purse
?
''
``
Alas
!
''
stammered
Gringoire
,
``
I
have
not
even
a
sou
.
''
``
Let
*NL*
them
hang
you
,
then
,
and
say
`
Thank
you
!
'
''
retorted
the
vagabond
wench
,
*NL*
turning
her
back
on
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
second
,
--
old
,
black
,
wrinkled
,
hideous
,
with
an
ugliness
conspicuous
*NL*
even
in
the
Cour
des
Miracles
,
trotted
round
Gringoire
.
He
almost
*NL*
trembled
lest
she
should
want
him
.
But
she
mumbled
between
her
teeth
,
*NL*
``
He
's
too
thin
,
''
and
went
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
third
was
a
young
girl
,
quite
fresh
,
and
not
too
ugly
.
``
Save
me
!
''
*NL*
said
the
poor
fellow
to
her
,
in
a
low
tone
.
She
gazed
at
him
for
a
*NL*
moment
with
an
air
of
pity
,
then
dropped
her
eyes
,
made
a
plait
in
her
*NL*
petticoat
,
and
remained
in
indecision
.
He
followed
all
these
movements
*NL*
with
his
eyes
;
it
was
the
last
gleam
of
hope
.
``
No
,
''
said
the
young
girl
,
*NL*
at
length
,
``
no
!
Guillaume
Longuejoue
would
beat
me
.
''
She
retreated
into
*NL*
the
crowd
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
unlucky
,
comrade
,
''
said
Clopin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
rising
to
his
feet
,
upon
his
hogshead
.
``
No
one
wants
him
,
''
he
*NL*
exclaimed
,
imitating
the
accent
of
an
auctioneer
,
to
the
great
delight
*NL*
of
all
;
``
no
one
wants
him
?
once
,
twice
,
three
times
!
''
and
,
turning
*NL*
towards
the
gibbet
with
a
sign
of
his
hand
,
``
Gone
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bellevigne
de
l'Etoile
,
Andry
the
Red
,
Francois
Chante-Prune
,
stepped
up
*NL*
to
Gringoire
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
a
cry
arose
among
the
thieves
:
``
La
Esmeralda
!
La
*NL*
Esmeralda
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gringoire
shuddered
,
and
turned
towards
the
side
whence
the
clamor
*NL*
proceeded
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
crowd
opened
,
and
gave
passage
to
a
pure
and
dazzling
form
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
gypsy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
La
Esmeralda
!
''
said
Gringoire
,
stupefied
in
the
midst
of
his
emotions
,
*NL*
by
the
abrupt
manner
in
which
that
magic
word
knotted
together
all
his
*NL*
reminiscences
of
the
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
rare
creature
seemed
,
even
in
the
Cour
des
Miracles
,
to
exercise
*NL*
her
sway
of
charm
and
beauty
.
The
vagabonds
,
male
and
female
,
ranged
*NL*
themselves
gently
along
her
path
,
and
their
brutal
faces
beamed
beneath
*NL*
her
glance
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
approached
the
victim
with
her
light
step
.
Her
pretty
Djali
followed
*NL*
her
.
Gringoire
was
more
dead
than
alive
.
She
examined
him
for
a
moment
*NL*
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
going
to
hang
this
man
?
''
she
said
gravely
,
to
Clopin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sister
,
''
replied
the
King
of
Thunes
,
``
unless
you
will
take
him
for
*NL*
your
husband
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
made
her
pretty
little
pout
with
her
under
lip
.
``
I
'll
take
him
,
''
*NL*
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gringoire
firmly
believed
that
he
had
been
in
a
dream
ever
since
*NL*
morning
,
and
that
this
was
the
continuation
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
change
was
,
in
fact
,
violent
,
though
a
gratifying
one
.
They
undid
*NL*
the
noose
,
and
made
the
poet
step
down
from
the
stool
.
His
emotion
was
*NL*
so
lively
that
he
was
obliged
to
sit
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Duke
of
Egypt
brought
an
earthenware
crock
,
without
uttering
a
word
.
*NL*
The
gypsy
offered
it
to
Gringoire
:
``
Fling
it
on
the
ground
,
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
crock
broke
into
four
pieces
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brother
,
''
then
said
the
Duke
of
Egypt
,
laying
his
hands
upon
their
*NL*
foreheads
,
``
she
is
your
wife
;
sister
,
he
is
your
husband
for
four
years
.
*NL*
Go

CHAPTER
VII
.
A
BRIDAL
NIGHT
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
moments
later
our
poet
found
himself
in
a
tiny
arched
chamber
,
*NL*
very
cosy
,
very
warm
,
seated
at
a
table
which
appeared
to
ask
nothing
*NL*
better
than
to
make
some
loans
from
a
larder
hanging
near
by
,
having
*NL*
a
good
bed
in
prospect
,
and
alone
with
a
pretty
girl
.
The
adventure
*NL*
smacked
of
enchantment
.
He
began
seriously
to
take
himself
for
a
*NL*
personage
in
a
fairy
tale
;
he
cast
his
eyes
about
him
from
time
to
*NL*
time
to
time
,
as
though
to
see
if
the
chariot
of
fire
,
harnessed
to
*NL*
two-winged
chimeras
,
which
alone
could
have
so
rapidly
transported
him
*NL*
from
Tartarus
to
Paradise
,
were
still
there
.
At
times
,
also
,
he
fixed
*NL*
his
eyes
obstinately
upon
the
holes
in
his
doublet
,
in
order
to
cling
*NL*
to
reality
,
and
not
lose
the
ground
from
under
his
feet
completely
.
His
*NL*
reason
,
tossed
about
in
imaginary
space
,
now
hung
only
by
this
thread
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
girl
did
not
appear
to
pay
any
attention
to
him
;
she
went
and
*NL*
came
,
displaced
a
stool
,
talked
to
her
goat
,
and
indulged
in
a
pout
*NL*
now
and
then
.
At
last
she
came
and
seated
herself
near
the
table
,
and
*NL*
Gringoire
was
able
to
scrutinize
her
at
his
ease
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
have
been
a
child
,
reader
,
and
you
would
,
perhaps
,
be
very
happy
to
*NL*
be
one
still
.
It
is
quite
certain
that
you
have
not
,
more
than
once
-LRB-
and
*NL*
for
my
part
,
I
have
passed
whole
days
,
the
best
employed
of
my
life
,
at
*NL*
it
-RRB-
followed
from
thicket
to
thicket
,
by
the
side
of
running
water
,
on
a
*NL*
sunny
day
,
a
beautiful
green
or
blue
dragon-fly
,
breaking
its
flight
in
*NL*
abrupt
angles
,
and
kissing
the
tips
of
all
the
branches
.
You
recollect
*NL*
with
what
amorous
curiosity
your
thought
and
your
gaze
were
riveted
*NL*
upon
this
little
whirlwind
,
hissing
and
humming
with
wings
of
purple
and
*NL*
azure
,
in
the
midst
of
which
floated
an
imperceptible
body
,
veiled
by
*NL*
the
very
rapidity
of
its
movement
.
The
aerial
being
which
was
dimly
*NL*
outlined
amid
this
quivering
of
wings
,
appeared
to
you
chimerical
,
*NL*
imaginary
,
impossible
to
touch
,
impossible
to
see
.
But
when
,
at
length
,
*NL*
the
dragon-fly
alighted
on
the
tip
of
a
reed
,
and
,
holding
your
breath
*NL*
the
while
,
you
were
able
to
examine
the
long
,
gauze
wings
,
the
long
*NL*
enamel
robe
,
the
two
globes
of
crystal
,
what
astonishment
you
felt
,
and
*NL*
what
fear
lest
you
should
again
behold
the
form
disappear
into
a
shade
,
*NL*
and
the
creature
into
a
chimera
!
Recall
these
impressions
,
and
you
will
*NL*
readily
appreciate
what
Gringoire
felt
on
contemplating
,
beneath
her
*NL*
visible
and
palpable
form
,
that
Esmeralda
of
whom
,
up
to
that
time
,
*NL*
he
had
only
caught
a
glimpse
,
amidst
a
whirlwind
of
dance
,
song
,
and
*NL*
tumult
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sinking
deeper
and
deeper
into
his
revery
:
``
So
this
,
''
he
said
to
*NL*
himself
,
following
her
vaguely
with
his
eyes
,
``
is
la
Esmeralda
!
a
*NL*
celestial
creature
!
a
street
dancer
!
so
much
,
and
so
little
!
'T
was
she
*NL*
who
dealt
the
death-blow
to
my
mystery
this
morning
,
't
is
she
who
saves
*NL*
my
life
this
evening
!
My
evil
genius
!
My
good
angel
!
A
pretty
woman
,
*NL*
on
my
word
!
and
who
must
needs
love
me
madly
to
have
taken
me
in
that
*NL*
fashion
.
By
the
way
,
''
said
he
,
rising
suddenly
,
with
that
sentiment
*NL*
of
the
true
which
formed
the
foundation
of
his
character
and
his
*NL*
philosophy
,
``
I
do
n't
know
very
well
how
it
happens
,
but
I
am
her
*NL*
husband
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
idea
in
his
head
and
in
his
eyes
,
he
stepped
up
to
the
young
*NL*
girl
in
a
manner
so
military
and
so
gallant
that
she
drew
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
of
me
?
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
ask
me
,
adorable
Esmeralda
?
''
replied
Gringoire
,
with
so
*NL*
passionate
an
accent
that
he
was
himself
astonished
at
it
on
hearing
*NL*
himself
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gypsy
opened
her
great
eyes
.
``
I
do
n't
know
what
you
mean
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
resumed
Gringoire
,
growing
warmer
and
warmer
,
and
supposing
*NL*
that
,
after
all
,
he
had
to
deal
merely
with
a
virtue
of
the
Cour
des
*NL*
Miracles
;
``
am
I
not
thine
,
sweet
friend
,
art
thou
not
mine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
quite
ingenuously
,
he
clasped
her
waist
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gypsy
's
corsage
slipped
through
his
hands
like
the
skin
of
an
eel
.
*NL*
She
bounded
from
one
end
of
the
tiny
room
to
the
other
,
stooped
down
,
*NL*
and
raised
herself
again
,
with
a
little
poniard
in
her
hand
,
before
*NL*
Gringoire
had
even
had
time
to
see
whence
the
poniard
came
;
proud
and
*NL*
angry
,
with
swelling
lips
and
inflated
nostrils
,
her
cheeks
as
red
as
an
*NL*
api
apple
,
*
and
her
eyes
darting
lightnings
.
At
the
same
time
,
the
white
*NL*
goat
placed
itself
in
front
of
her
,
and
presented
to
Gringoire
a
hostile
*NL*
front
,
bristling
with
two
pretty
horns
,
gilded
and
very
sharp
.
All
this
*NL*
took
place
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
A
small
dessert
apple
,
bright
red
on
one
side
and
*NL*
greenish-white
on
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
dragon-fly
had
turned
into
a
wasp
,
and
asked
nothing
better
than
to
*NL*
sting
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
philosopher
was
speechless
,
and
turned
his
astonished
eyes
from
the
*NL*
goat
to
the
young
girl
.
``
Holy
Virgin
!
''
he
said
at
last
,
when
surprise
*NL*
permitted
him
to
speak
,
``
here
are
two
hearty
dames
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
gypsy
broke
the
silence
on
her
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
be
a
very
bold
knave
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
,
mademoiselle
,
''
said
Gringoire
,
with
a
smile
.
``
But
why
did
you
*NL*
take
me
for
your
husband
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Should
I
have
allowed
you
to
be
hanged
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
''
said
the
poet
,
somewhat
disappointed
in
his
amorous
hopes
.
``
You
*NL*
had
no
other
idea
in
marrying
me
than
to
save
me
from
the
gibbet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
other
idea
did
you
suppose
that
I
had
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gringoire
bit
his
lips
.
``
Come
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
am
not
yet
so
triumphant
in
*NL*
Cupido
,
as
I
thought
.
But
then
,
what
was
the
good
of
breaking
that
poor
*NL*
jug
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
Esmeralda
's
dagger
and
the
goat
's
horns
were
still
upon
the
*NL*
defensive
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mademoiselle
Esmeralda
,
''
said
the
poet
,
``
let
us
come
to
terms
.
I
am
*NL*
not
a
clerk
of
the
court
,
and
I
shall
not
go
to
law
with
you
for
*NL*
thus
carrying
a
dagger
in
Paris
,
in
the
teeth
of
the
ordinances
and
*NL*
prohibitions
of
M.
the
Provost
.
Nevertheless
,
you
are
not
ignorant
of
*NL*
the
fact
that
Noel
Lescrivain
was
condemned
,
a
week
ago
,
to
pay
ten
*NL*
Parisian
sous
,
for
having
carried
a
cutlass
.
But
this
is
no
affair
of
*NL*
mine
,
and
I
will
come
to
the
point
.
I
swear
to
you
,
upon
my
share
of
*NL*
Paradise
,
not
to
approach
you
without
your
leave
and
permission
,
but
do
*NL*
give
me
some
supper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
truth
is
,
Gringoire
was
,
like
M.
Despreaux
,
``
not
very
voluptuous
.
''
*NL*
He
did
not
belong
to
that
chevalier
and
musketeer
species
,
who
take
*NL*
young
girls
by
assault
.
In
the
matter
of
love
,
as
in
all
other
affairs
,
*NL*
he
willingly
assented
to
temporizing
and
adjusting
terms
;
and
a
good
*NL*
supper
,
and
an
amiable
tete-a-tete
appeared
to
him
,
especially
when
*NL*
he
was
hungry
,
an
excellent
interlude
between
the
prologue
and
the
*NL*
catastrophe
of
a
love
adventure
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gypsy
did
not
reply
.
She
made
her
disdainful
little
grimace
,
drew
*NL*
up
her
head
like
a
bird
,
then
burst
out
laughing
,
and
the
tiny
poniard
*NL*
disappeared
as
it
had
come
,
without
Gringoire
being
able
to
see
where
*NL*
the
wasp
concealed
its
sting
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
moment
later
,
there
stood
upon
the
table
a
loaf
of
rye
bread
,
a
slice
*NL*
of
bacon
,
some
wrinkled
apples
and
a
jug
of
beer
.
Gringoire
began
to
eat
*NL*
eagerly
.
One
would
have
said
,
to
hear
the
furious
clashing
of
his
*NL*
iron
fork
and
his
earthenware
plate
,
that
all
his
love
had
turned
to
*NL*
appetite
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
girl
seated
opposite
him
,
watched
him
in
silence
,
visibly
*NL*
preoccupied
with
another
thought
,
at
which
she
smiled
from
time
to
time
,
*NL*
while
her
soft
hand
caressed
the
intelligent
head
of
the
goat
,
gently
*NL*
pressed
between
her
knees
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
candle
of
yellow
wax
illuminated
this
scene
of
voracity
and
revery
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
the
first
cravings
of
his
stomach
having
been
stilled
,
*NL*
Gringoire
felt
some
false
shame
at
perceiving
that
nothing
remained
but
*NL*
one
apple
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
not
eat
,
Mademoiselle
Esmeralda
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
replied
by
a
negative
sign
of
the
head
,
and
her
pensive
glance
fixed
*NL*
itself
upon
the
vault
of
the
ceiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
the
deuce
is
she
thinking
of
?
''
thought
Gringoire
,
staring
at
what
*NL*
she
was
gazing
at
;
''
't
is
impossible
that
it
can
be
that
stone
dwarf
*NL*
carved
in
the
keystone
of
that
arch
,
which
thus
absorbs
her
attention
.
*NL*
What
the
deuce
!
I
can
bear
the
comparison
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
raised
his
voice
,
``
Mademoiselle
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
seemed
not
to
hear
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
repeated
,
still
more
loudly
,
``
Mademoiselle
Esmeralda
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Trouble
wasted
.
The
young
girl
's
mind
was
elsewhere
,
and
Gringoire
's
*NL*
voice
had
not
the
power
to
recall
it
.
Fortunately
,
the
goat
interfered
.
*NL*
She
began
to
pull
her
mistress
gently
by
the
sleeve
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
dost
thou
want
,
Djali
?
''
said
the
gypsy
,
hastily
,
as
though
*NL*
suddenly
awakened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
hungry
,
''
said
Gringoire
,
charmed
to
enter
into
conversation
.
*NL*
Esmeralda
began
to
crumble
some
bread
,
which
Djali
ate
gracefully
from
*NL*
the
hollow
of
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
Gringoire
did
not
give
her
time
to
resume
her
revery
.
He
*NL*
hazarded
a
delicate
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
do
n't
want
me
for
your
husband
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
girl
looked
at
him
intently
,
and
said
,
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
your
lover
?
''
went
on
Gringoire
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
pouted
,
and
replied
,
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
your
friend
?
''
pursued
Gringoire
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
gazed
fixedly
at
him
again
,
and
said
,
after
a
momentary
reflection
,
*NL*
``
Perhaps
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
``
perhaps
,
''
so
dear
to
philosophers
,
emboldened
Gringoire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
what
friendship
is
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
replied
the
gypsy
;
``
it
is
to
be
brother
and
sister
;
two
souls
*NL*
which
touch
without
mingling
,
two
fingers
on
one
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
love
?
''
pursued
Gringoire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
love
!
''
said
she
,
and
her
voice
trembled
,
and
her
eye
beamed
.
``
That
*NL*
is
to
be
two
and
to
be
but
one
.
A
man
and
a
woman
mingled
into
one
*NL*
angel
.
It
is
heaven
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
street
dancer
had
a
beauty
as
she
spoke
thus
,
that
struck
Gringoire
*NL*
singularly
,
and
seemed
to
him
in
perfect
keeping
with
the
almost
*NL*
oriental
exaltation
of
her
words
.
Her
pure
,
red
lips
half
smiled
;
*NL*
her
serene
and
candid
brow
became
troubled
,
at
intervals
,
under
her
*NL*
thoughts
,
like
a
mirror
under
the
breath
;
and
from
beneath
her
long
,
*NL*
drooping
,
black
eyelashes
,
there
escaped
a
sort
of
ineffable
light
,
*NL*
which
gave
to
her
profile
that
ideal
serenity
which
Raphael
found
at
the
*NL*
mystic
point
of
intersection
of
virginity
,
maternity
,
and
divinity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
Gringoire
continued
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
must
one
be
then
,
in
order
to
please
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
--
''
said
he
,
``
what
,
then
,
am
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
man
has
a
hemlet
on
his
head
,
a
sword
in
his
hand
,
and
golden
spurs
*NL*
on
his
heels
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
,
''
said
Gringoire
,
``
without
a
horse
,
no
man
.
Do
you
love
any
one
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
a
lover
?
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
remained
thoughtful
for
a
moment
,
then
said
with
a
peculiar
*NL*
expression
:
``
That
I
shall
know
soon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
this
evening
?
''
resumed
the
poet
tenderly
.
``
Why
not
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
cast
a
grave
glance
upon
him
and
said
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
never
love
a
man
who
can
not
protect
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gringoire
colored
,
and
took
the
hint
.
It
was
evident
that
the
young
girl
*NL*
was
alluding
to
the
slight
assistance
which
he
had
rendered
her
in
the
*NL*
critical
situation
in
which
she
had
found
herself
two
hours
previously
.
*NL*
This
memory
,
effaced
by
his
own
adventures
of
the
evening
,
now
recurred
*NL*
to
him
.
He
smote
his
brow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
way
,
mademoiselle
,
I
ought
to
have
begun
there
.
Pardon
my
*NL*
foolish
absence
of
mind
.
How
did
you
contrive
to
escape
from
the
claws
*NL*
of
Quasimodo
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
question
made
the
gypsy
shudder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
the
horrible
hunchback
,
''
said
she
,
hiding
her
face
in
her
hands
.
*NL*
And
she
shuddered
as
though
with
violent
cold
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Horrible
,
in
truth
,
''
said
Gringoire
,
who
clung
to
his
idea
;
``
but
how
*NL*
did
you
manage
to
escape
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
La
Esmeralda
smiled
,
sighed
,
and
remained
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
why
he
followed
you
?
''
began
Gringoire
again
,
seeking
to
*NL*
return
to
his
question
by
a
circuitous
route
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
the
young
girl
,
and
she
added
hastily
,
``
but
you
*NL*
were
following
me
also
,
why
were
you
following
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
good
faith
,
''
responded
Gringoire
,
``
I
do
n't
know
either
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Silence
ensued
.
Gringoire
slashed
the
table
with
his
knife
.
The
young
*NL*
girl
smiled
and
seemed
to
be
gazing
through
the
wall
at
something
.
All
*NL*
at
once
she
began
to
sing
in
a
barely
articulate
voice
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
_
Quando
las
pintadas
aves
,
*NL*
Mudas
estan
,
y
la
tierra

--
*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
When
the
gay-plumaged
birds
grow
weary
,
and
the
earth
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
She
broke
off
abruptly
,
and
began
to
caress
Djali
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
pretty
animal
of
yours
,
''
said
Gringoire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
my
sister
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
are
you
called
`
la
Esmeralda
?
'
''
asked
the
poet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
drew
from
her
bosom
a
sort
of
little
oblong
bag
,
suspended
from
her
*NL*
neck
by
a
string
of
adrezarach
beads
.
This
bag
exhaled
a
strong
odor
of
*NL*
camphor
.
It
was
covered
with
green
silk
,
and
bore
in
its
centre
a
large
*NL*
piece
of
green
glass
,
in
imitation
of
an
emerald
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
it
is
because
of
this
,
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gringoire
was
on
the
point
of
taking
the
bag
in
his
hand
.
She
drew
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
touch
it
!
It
is
an
amulet
.
You
would
injure
the
charm
or
the
*NL*
charm
would
injure
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
poet
's
curiosity
was
more
and
more
aroused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
gave
it
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
laid
one
finger
on
her
mouth
and
concealed
the
amulet
in
her
bosom
.
*NL*
He
tried
a
few
more
questions
,
but
she
hardly
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
meaning
of
the
words
,
`
la
Esmeralda
?
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
what
language
do
they
belong
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
Egyptian
,
I
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suspected
as
much

said
Gringoire
,
``
you
are
not
a
native
of
France

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
your
parents
alive

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
began
to
sing
,
to
an
ancient
air
,

``

said
Gringoire
.
``
At
what
age
did
you
come
to
France

*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
was
very
young

*NL*
*NL*
``
And

*NL*
*NL*
``
Last
year

At
the
moment
when
we
were
entering
the
papal
gate
I
saw
*NL*
a
reed
warbler
flit
through
the
air
,
that
was
at
the
end
of
August
;
I
*NL*
said
,
it
will
be
a
hard
winter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
it
was
,
''
said
Gringoire
,
delighted
at
this
beginning
of
a
*NL*
conversation
.
``
I
passed
it
in
blowing
my
fingers
.
So
you
have
the
gift
*NL*
of
prophecy

*NL*
*NL*
She
retired
into
her
laconics
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
man

you
call

Egypt

*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
was

remarked
the
poet
timidly
.
*NL*

She
made
her
customary
pretty
grimace
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
even
know
your
name

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
name

If
you
want

here
it
is

Pierre
Gringoire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
a
prettier
one
,
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Naughty
girl
!
''
retorted
the
poet
.
``
Never
mind
,
you
shall
not
provoke
*NL*
me
.
Wait
,
perhaps
you
will
love
me
more
when
you
know
me
better
;
and
*NL*
then
,
you
have
told
me
your
story
with
so
much
confidence
,
that
I
*NL*
owe
you
a
little
of
mine
.
You
must
know
,
then
,
that
my
name
is
Pierre
*NL*
Gringoire
,
and
that
I
am
a
son
of
the
farmer
of
the
notary
's
office
*NL*
of
Gonesse
.
My
father
was
hung
by
the
Burgundians
,
and
my
mother
*NL*
disembowelled
by
the
Picards
,
at
the
siege
of
Paris
,
twenty
years
ago
.
*NL*
At
six
years
of
age
,
therefore
,
I
was
an
orphan
,
without
a
sole
to
*NL*
my
foot
except
the
pavements
of
Paris
.
I
do
not
know
how
I
passed
the
*NL*
interval
from
six
to
sixteen
.
A
fruit
dealer
gave
me
a
plum
here
,
a
*NL*
baker
flung
me
a
crust
there
;
in
the
evening
I
got
myself
taken
up
*NL*
by
the
watch
,
who
threw
me
into
prison
,
and
there
I
found
a
bundle
of
*NL*
straw
.
All
this
did
not
prevent
my
growing
up
and
growing
thin
,
as
you
*NL*
see
.
In
the
winter
I
warmed
myself
in
the
sun
,
under
the
porch
of
the
*NL*
Hotel
de
Sens
,
and
I
thought
it
very
ridiculous
that
the
fire
on
Saint
*NL*
John
's
Day
was
reserved
for
the
dog
days
.
At
sixteen
,
I
wished
to
choose
*NL*
a
calling
.
I
tried
all
in
succession
.
I
became
a
soldier
;
but
I
was
not
*NL*
brave
enough
.
I
became
a
monk
;
but
I
was
not
sufficiently
devout
;
and
*NL*
then
I
'm
a
bad
hand
at
drinking
.
In
despair
,
I
became
an
apprentice
*NL*
of
the
woodcutters
,
but
I
was
not
strong
enough
;
I
had
more
of
an
*NL*
inclination
to
become
a
schoolmaster
;
't
is
true
that
I
did
not
know
how
*NL*
to
read
,
but
that
's
no
reason
.
I
perceived
at
the
end
of
a
certain
time
,
*NL*
that
I
lacked
something
in
every
direction
;
and
seeing
that
I
was
good
*NL*
for
nothing
,
of
my
own
free
will
I
became
a
poet
and
rhymester
.
That
*NL*
is
a
trade
which
one
can
always
adopt
when
one
is
a
vagabond
,
and
it
's
*NL*
better
than
stealing
,
as
some
young
brigands
of
my
acquaintance
advised
*NL*
me
to
do
.
One
day
I
met
by
luck
,
Dom
Claude
Frollo
,
the
reverend
*NL*
archdeacon
of
Notre-Dame
.
He
took
an
interest
in
me
,
and
it
is
to
him
*NL*
that
I
to-day
owe
it
that
I
am
a
veritable
man
of
letters
,
who
knows
*NL*
Latin
from
the
_
de
Officiis
_
of
Cicero
to
the
mortuology
of
the
*NL*
Celestine
Fathers
,
and
a
barbarian
neither
in
scholastics
,
nor
in
*NL*
politics
,
nor
in
rhythmics
,
that
sophism
of
sophisms
.
I
am
the
author
*NL*
of
the
Mystery
which
was
presented
to-day
with
great
triumph
and
a
great
*NL*
concourse
of
populace
,
in
the
grand
hall
of
the
Palais
de
Justice
.
*NL*
I
have
also
made
a
book
which
will
contain
six
hundred
pages
,
on
the
*NL*
wonderful
comet
of
1465
,
which
sent
one
man
mad
.
I
have
enjoyed
still
*NL*
other
successes
.
Being
somewhat
of
an
artillery
carpenter
,
I
lent
a
hand
*NL*
to
Jean
Mangue
's
great
bombard
,
which
burst
,
as
you
know
,
on
the
day
*NL*
when
it
was
tested
,
on
the
Pont
de
Charenton
,
and
killed
four
and
twenty
*NL*
curious
spectators
.
You
see
that
I
am
not
a
bad
match
in
marriage
.
I
*NL*
know
a
great
many
sorts
of
very
engaging
tricks
,
which
I
will
teach
your
*NL*
goat
;
for
example
,
to
mimic
the
Bishop
of
Paris
,
that
cursed
Pharisee
*NL*
whose
mill
wheels
splash
passers-by
the
whole
length
of
the
Pont
aux
*NL*
Meuniers
.
And
then
my
mystery
will
bring
me
in
a
great
deal
of
coined
*NL*
money
,
if
they
will
only
pay
me
.
And
finally
,
I
am
at
your
orders
,
I
and
*NL*
my
wits
,
and
my
science
and
my
letters
,
ready
to
live
with
you
,
damsel
,
*NL*
as
it
shall
please
you
,
chastely
or
joyously
;
husband
and
wife
,
if
you
*NL*
see
fit
;
brother
and
sister
,
if
you
think
that
better
.

*NL*
Gringoire
ceased
,
awaiting
the
effect
of
his
harangue
on
the
young
girl
.
*NL*
Her
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Phoebus
,
'
''
she
said
in
a
low
voice
.
Then
,
turning
towards
the
poet
,
*NL*
''
`
Phoebus
'
,
--
what
does
that
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gringoire
,
without
exactly
understanding
what
the
connection
could
be
*NL*
between
his
address
and
this
question
,
was
not
sorry
to
display
his
*NL*
erudition
.
Assuming
an
air
of
importance
,
he
replied
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
Latin
word
which
means
`
sun
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sun
!
''
she
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
the
name
of
a
handsome
archer
,
who
was
a
god
,
''
added
Gringoire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
god
!
''
repeated
the
gypsy
,
and
there
was
something
pensive
and
*NL*
passionate
in
her
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
,
one
of
her
bracelets
became
unfastened
and
fell
.
*NL*
Gringoire
stooped
quickly
to
pick
it
up
;
when
he
straightened
up
,
the
*NL*
young
girl
and
the
goat
had
disappeared
.
He
heard
the
sound
of
a
bolt
.
*NL*
It
was
a
little
door
,
communicating
,
no
doubt
,
with
a
neighboring
cell
,
*NL*
which
was
being
fastened
on
the
outside
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
she
left
me
a
bed
,
at
least
?
''
said
our
philosopher
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
the
tour
of
his
cell
.
There
was
no
piece
of
furniture
adapted
to
*NL*
sleeping
purposes
,
except
a
tolerably
long
wooden
coffer
;
and
its
cover
*NL*
was
carved
,
to
boot
;
which
afforded
Gringoire
,
when
he
stretched
himself
*NL*
out
upon
it
,
a
sensation
somewhat
similar
to
that
which
Micromegas
would
*NL*
feel
if
he
were
to
lie
down
on
the
Alps
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
!
''
said
he
,
adjusting
himself
as
well
as
possible
,
``
I
must
resign
*NL*
myself
.
But
here
's
a
strange
nuptial
night
.
'T
is
a
pity
.
There
was
*NL*
something
innocent
and
antediluvian
about
that
broken
crock
,
which
quite
*NL*
pleased
me

CHAPTER
I.
NOTRE-DAME
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
church
of
Notre-Dame
de
Paris
is
still
no
doubt
,
a
majestic
and
*NL*
sublime
edifice
.
But
,
beautiful
as
it
has
been
preserved
in
growing
old
,
*NL*
it
is
difficult
not
to
sigh
,
not
to
wax
indignant
,
before
the
numberless
*NL*
degradations
and
mutilations
which
time
and
men
have
both
caused
the
*NL*
venerable
monument
to
suffer
,
without
respect
for
Charlemagne
,
who
laid
*NL*
its
first
stone
,
or
for
Philip
Augustus
,
who
laid
the
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
face
of
this
aged
queen
of
our
cathedrals
,
by
the
side
of
a
*NL*
wrinkle
,
one
always
finds
a
scar
.
_
Tempus
edax
,
homo
edacior
*
_
;
which
I
*NL*
should
be
glad
to
translate
thus
:
time
is
blind
,
man
is
stupid
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
Time
is
a
devourer
;
man
,
more
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
If
we
had
leisure
to
examine
with
the
reader
,
one
by
one
,
the
diverse
*NL*
traces
of
destruction
imprinted
upon
the
old
church
,
time
's
share
would
*NL*
be
the
least
,
the
share
of
men
the
most
,
especially
the
men
of
art
,
*NL*
since
there
have
been
individuals
who
assumed
the
title
of
architects
*NL*
during
the
last
two
centuries
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
in
the
first
place
,
to
cite
only
a
few
leading
examples
,
there
*NL*
certainly
are
few
finer
architectural
pages
than
this
facade
,
where
,
*NL*
successively
and
at
once
,
the
three
portals
hollowed
out
in
an
arch
;
the
*NL*
broidered
and
dentated
cordon
of
the
eight
and
twenty
royal
niches
;
the
*NL*
immense
central
rose
window
,
flanked
by
its
two
lateral
windows
,
like
*NL*
a
priest
by
his
deacon
and
subdeacon
;
the
frail
and
lofty
gallery
of
*NL*
trefoil
arcades
,
which
supports
a
heavy
platform
above
its
fine
,
slender
*NL*
columns
;
and
lastly
,
the
two
black
and
massive
towers
with
their
slate
*NL*
penthouses
,
harmonious
parts
of
a
magnificent
whole
,
superposed
in
five
*NL*
gigantic
stories
;
--
develop
themselves
before
the
eye
,
in
a
mass
and
*NL*
without
confusion
,
with
their
innumerable
details
of
statuary
,
carving
,
*NL*
and
sculpture
,
joined
powerfully
to
the
tranquil
grandeur
of
the
whole
;
*NL*
a
vast
symphony
in
stone
,
so
to
speak
;
the
colossal
work
of
one
man
*NL*
and
one
people
,
all
together
one
and
complex
,
like
the
Iliads
and
the
*NL*
Romanceros
,
whose
sister
it
is
;
prodigious
product
of
the
grouping
*NL*
together
of
all
the
forces
of
an
epoch
,
where
,
upon
each
stone
,
one
sees
*NL*
the
fancy
of
the
workman
disciplined
by
the
genius
of
the
artist
start
*NL*
forth
in
a
hundred
fashions
;
a
sort
of
human
creation
,
in
a
word
,
*NL*
powerful
and
fecund
as
the
divine
creation
of
which
it
seems
to
have
*NL*
stolen
the
double
character
,
--
variety
,
eternity
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
what
we
here
say
of
the
facade
must
be
said
of
the
entire
church
;
*NL*
and
what
we
say
of
the
cathedral
church
of
Paris
,
must
be
said
of
all
*NL*
the
churches
of
Christendom
in
the
Middle
Ages
.
All
things
are
in
place
*NL*
in
that
art
,
self-created
,
logical
,
and
well
proportioned
.
To
measure
*NL*
the
great
toe
of
the
foot
is
to
measure
the
giant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
return
to
the
facade
of
Notre-Dame
,
as
it
still
appears
to
us
,
*NL*
when
we
go
piously
to
admire
the
grave
and
puissant
cathedral
,
which
*NL*
inspires
terror
,
so
its
chronicles
assert
:
_
quae
mole
sua
terrorem
*NL*
incutit
spectantibus
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
Three
important
things
are
to-day
lacking
in
that
facade
:
in
the
first
*NL*
place
,
the
staircase
of
eleven
steps
which
formerly
raised
it
above
the
*NL*
soil
;
next
,
the
lower
series
of
statues
which
occupied
the
niches
of
*NL*
the
three
portals
;
and
lastly
the
upper
series
,
of
the
twenty-eight
most
*NL*
ancient
kings
of
France
,
which
garnished
the
gallery
of
the
first
story
,
*NL*
beginning
with
Childebert
,
and
ending
with
Phillip
Augustus
,
holding
in
*NL*
his
hand
``
the
imperial
apple
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Time
has
caused
the
staircase
to
disappear
,
by
raising
the
soil
of
the
*NL*
city
with
a
slow
and
irresistible
progress
;
but
,
while
thus
causing
the
*NL*
eleven
steps
which
added
to
the
majestic
height
of
the
edifice
,
to
*NL*
be
devoured
,
one
by
one
,
by
the
rising
tide
of
the
pavements
of
*NL*
Paris
,
--
time
has
bestowed
upon
the
church
perhaps
more
than
it
has
taken
*NL*
away
,
for
it
is
time
which
has
spread
over
the
facade
that
sombre
hue
of
*NL*
the
centuries
which
makes
the
old
age
of
monuments
the
period
of
their
*NL*
beauty
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
who
has
thrown
down
the
two
rows
of
statues
?
who
has
left
the
niches
*NL*
empty
?
who
has
cut
,
in
the
very
middle
of
the
central
portal
,
that
new
*NL*
and
bastard
arch
?
who
has
dared
to
frame
therein
that
commonplace
and
*NL*
heavy
door
of
carved
wood
,
a
la
Louis
XV.
,
beside
the
arabesques
of
*NL*
Biscornette
?
The
men
,
the
architects
,
the
artists
of
our
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
if
we
enter
the
interior
of
the
edifice
,
who
has
overthrown
that
*NL*
colossus
of
Saint
Christopher
,
proverbial
for
magnitude
among
statues
,
*NL*
as
the
grand
hall
of
the
Palais
de
Justice
was
among
halls
,
as
the
spire
*NL*
of
Strasbourg
among
spires
?
And
those
myriads
of
statues
,
which
peopled
*NL*
all
the
spaces
between
the
columns
of
the
nave
and
the
choir
,
kneeling
,
*NL*
standing
,
equestrian
,
men
,
women
,
children
,
kings
,
bishops
,
gendarmes
,
*NL*
in
stone
,
in
marble
,
in
gold
,
in
silver
,
in
copper
,
in
wax
even
,
--
who
*NL*
has
brutally
swept
them
away
?
It
is
not
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
who
substituted
for
the
ancient
gothic
altar
,
splendidly
encumbered
*NL*
with
shrines
and
reliquaries
,
that
heavy
marble
sarcophagus
,
with
*NL*
angels
'
heads
and
clouds
,
which
seems
a
specimen
pillaged
from
*NL*
the
Val-de-Grace
or
the
Invalides
?
Who
stupidly
sealed
that
heavy
*NL*
anachronism
of
stone
in
the
Carlovingian
pavement
of
Hercandus
?
Was
it
*NL*
not
Louis
XIV.
,
fulfilling
the
request
of
Louis
XIII
.
?
*NL*
*NL*
And
who
put
the
cold
,
white
panes
in
the
place
of
those
windows
,
``
high
*NL*
in
color
,
''
which
caused
the
astonished
eyes
of
our
fathers
to
hesitate
*NL*
between
the
rose
of
the
grand
portal
and
the
arches
of
the
apse
?
And
*NL*
what
would
a
sub-chanter
of
the
sixteenth
century
say
,
on
beholding
*NL*
the
beautiful
yellow
wash
,
with
which
our
archiepiscopal
vandals
have
*NL*
desmeared
their
cathedral
?
He
would
remember
that
it
was
the
color
with
*NL*
which
the
hangman
smeared
``
accursed
''
edifices
;
he
would
recall
the
*NL*
Hotel
du
Petit-Bourbon
,
all
smeared
thus
,
on
account
of
the
constable
's
*NL*
treason
.
``
Yellow
,
after
all
,
of
so
good
a
quality
,
''
said
Sauval
,
``
and
so
*NL*
well
recommended
,
that
more
than
a
century
has
not
yet
caused
it
to
lose
*NL*
its
color
.
''
He
would
think
that
the
sacred
place
had
become
infamous
,
*NL*
and
would
flee
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
if
we
ascend
the
cathedral
,
without
mentioning
a
thousand
barbarisms
*NL*
of
every
sort
,
--
what
has
become
of
that
charming
little
bell
tower
,
*NL*
which
rested
upon
the
point
of
intersection
of
the
cross-roofs
,
*NL*
and
which
,
no
less
frail
and
no
less
bold
than
its
neighbor
-LRB-
also
*NL*
destroyed
-RRB-
,
the
spire
of
the
Sainte-Chapelle
,
buried
itself
in
the
sky
,
*NL*
farther
forward
than
the
towers
,
slender
,
pointed
,
sonorous
,
carved
*NL*
in
open
work
.
An
architect
of
good
taste
amputated
it
-LRB-
1787
-RRB-
,
and
*NL*
considered
it
sufficient
to
mask
the
wound
with
that
large
,
leaden
*NL*
plaster
,
which
resembles
a
pot
cover
.
*NL*
*NL*
'T
is
thus
that
the
marvellous
art
of
the
Middle
Ages
has
been
treated
in
*NL*
nearly
every
country
,
especially
in
France
.
One
can
distinguish
on
*NL*
its
ruins
three
sorts
of
lesions
,
all
three
of
which
cut
into
it
at
*NL*
different
depths
;
first
,
time
,
which
has
insensibly
notched
its
surface
*NL*
here
and
there
,
and
gnawed
it
everywhere
;
next
,
political
and
religious
*NL*
revolution
,
which
,
blind
and
wrathful
by
nature
,
have
flung
themselves
*NL*
tumultuously
upon
it
,
torn
its
rich
garment
of
carving
and
sculpture
,
*NL*
burst
its
rose
windows
,
broken
its
necklace
of
arabesques
and
tiny
*NL*
figures
,
torn
out
its
statues
,
sometimes
because
of
their
mitres
,
*NL*
sometimes
because
of
their
crowns
;
lastly
,
fashions
,
even
more
grotesque
*NL*
and
foolish
,
which
,
since
the
anarchical
and
splendid
deviations
of
*NL*
the
Renaissance
,
have
followed
each
other
in
the
necessary
decadence
*NL*
of
architecture
.
Fashions
have
wrought
more
harm
than
revolutions
.
They
*NL*
have
cut
to
the
quick
;
they
have
attacked
the
very
bone
and
framework
of
*NL*
art
;
they
have
cut
,
slashed
,
disorganized
,
killed
the
edifice
,
in
form
*NL*
as
in
the
symbol
,
in
its
consistency
as
well
as
in
its
beauty
.
And
*NL*
then
they
have
made
it
over
;
a
presumption
of
which
neither
time
nor
*NL*
revolutions
at
least
have
been
guilty
.
They
have
audaciously
adjusted
,
*NL*
in
the
name
of
``
good
taste
,
''
upon
the
wounds
of
gothic
architecture
,
*NL*
their
miserable
gewgaws
of
a
day
,
their
ribbons
of
marble
,
their
pompons
*NL*
of
metal
,
a
veritable
leprosy
of
egg-shaped
ornaments
,
volutes
,
whorls
,
*NL*
draperies
,
garlands
,
fringes
,
stone
flames
,
bronze
clouds
,
pudgy
cupids
,
*NL*
chubby-cheeked
cherubim
,
which
begin
to
devour
the
face
of
art
in
the
*NL*
oratory
of
Catherine
de
Medicis
,
and
cause
it
to
expire
,
two
centuries
*NL*
later
,
tortured
and
grimacing
,
in
the
boudoir
of
the
Dubarry
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
,
to
sum
up
the
points
which
we
have
just
indicated
,
three
sorts
of
*NL*
ravages
to-day
disfigure
Gothic
architecture
.
Wrinkles
and
warts
on
the
*NL*
epidermis
;
this
is
the
work
of
time
.
Deeds
of
violence
,
brutalities
,
*NL*
contusions
,
fractures
;
this
is
the
work
of
the
revolutions
from
Luther
*NL*
to
Mirabeau
.
Mutilations
,
amputations
,
dislocation
of
the
joints
,
*NL*
``
restorations
''
;
this
is
the
Greek
,
Roman
,
and
barbarian
work
of
*NL*
professors
according
to
Vitruvius
and
Vignole
.
This
magnificent
art
*NL*
produced
by
the
Vandals
has
been
slain
by
the
academies
.
The
centuries
,
*NL*
the
revolutions
,
which
at
least
devastate
with
impartiality
and
*NL*
grandeur
,
have
been
joined
by
a
cloud
of
school
architects
,
licensed
,
*NL*
sworn
,
and
bound
by
oath
;
defacing
with
the
discernment
and
choice
of
*NL*
bad
taste
,
substituting
the
_
chicorees
_
of
Louis
XV
.
for
the
Gothic
*NL*
lace
,
for
the
greater
glory
of
the
Parthenon
.
It
is
the
kick
of
the
ass
*NL*
at
the
dying
lion
.
It
is
the
old
oak
crowning
itself
,
and
which
,
to
heap
*NL*
the
measure
full
,
is
stung
,
bitten
,
and
gnawed
by
caterpillars
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
far
it
is
from
the
epoch
when
Robert
Cenalis
,
comparing
Notre-Dame
*NL*
de
Paris
to
the
famous
temple
of
Diana
at
Ephesus
,
*
so
much
lauded
*NL*
by
the
ancient
pagans
*
,
which
Erostatus
*
has
*
immortalized
,
found
*NL*
the
Gallic
temple
``
more
excellent
in
length
,
breadth
,
height
,
and
*NL*
structure
.

*NL*
*NL*
Notre-Dame
is
not
,
moreover
,
what
can
be
called
a
complete
,
definite
,
*NL*
classified
monument
.
It
is
no
longer
a
Romanesque
church
;
nor
is
it
a
*NL*
Gothic
church
.
This
edifice
is
not
a
type
.
Notre-Dame
de
Paris
has
not
,
*NL*
like
the
Abbey
of
Tournus
,
the
grave
and
massive
frame
,
the
large
*NL*
and
round
vault
,
the
glacial
bareness
,
the
majestic
simplicity
of
the
*NL*
edifices
which
have
the
rounded
arch
for
their
progenitor
.
It
is
not
,
*NL*
like
the
Cathedral
of
Bourges
,
the
magnificent
,
light
,
multiform
,
*NL*
tufted
,
bristling
efflorescent
product
of
the
pointed
arch
.
Impossible
*NL*
to
class
it
in
that
ancient
family
of
sombre
,
mysterious
churches
,
low
*NL*
and
crushed
as
it
were
by
the
round
arch
,
almost
Egyptian
,
with
the
*NL*
exception
of
the
ceiling
;
all
hieroglyphics
,
all
sacerdotal
,
all
*NL*
symbolical
,
more
loaded
in
their
ornaments
,
with
lozenges
and
zigzags
,
*NL*
than
with
flowers
,
with
flowers
than
with
animals
,
with
animals
than
*NL*
with
men
;
the
work
of
the
architect
less
than
of
the
bishop
;
first
*NL*
transformation
of
art
,
all
impressed
with
theocratic
and
military
*NL*
discipline
,
taking
root
in
the
Lower
Empire
,
and
stopping
with
the
time
*NL*
of
William
the
Conqueror
.
Impossible
to
place
our
Cathedral
in
that
*NL*
other
family
of
lofty
,
aerial
churches
,
rich
in
painted
windows
and
*NL*
sculpture
;
pointed
in
form
,
bold
in
attitude
;
communal
and
bourgeois
as
*NL*
political
symbols
;
free
,
capricious
,
lawless
,
as
a
work
of
art
;
second
*NL*
transformation
of
architecture
,
no
longer
hieroglyphic
,
immovable
and
*NL*
sacerdotal
,
but
artistic
,
progressive
,
and
popular
,
which
begins
at
the
*NL*
return
from
the
crusades
,
and
ends
with
Louis
IX
.
Notre-Dame
de
Paris
is
*NL*
not
of
pure
Romanesque
,
like
the
first
;
nor
of
pure
Arabian
race
,
like
*NL*
the
second
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
an
edifice
of
the
transition
period
.
The
Saxon
architect
completed
*NL*
the
erection
of
the
first
pillars
of
the
nave
,
when
the
pointed
arch
,
*NL*
which
dates
from
the
Crusade
,
arrived
and
placed
itself
as
a
conqueror
*NL*
upon
the
large
Romanesque
capitals
which
should
support
only
round
*NL*
arches
.
The
pointed
arch
,
mistress
since
that
time
,
constructed
the
rest
*NL*
of
the
church
.
Nevertheless
,
timid
and
inexperienced
at
the
start
,
it
*NL*
sweeps
out
,
grows
larger
,
restrains
itself
,
and
dares
no
longer
dart
*NL*
upwards
in
spires
and
lancet
windows
,
as
it
did
later
on
,
in
so
many
*NL*
marvellous
cathedrals
.
One
would
say
that
it
were
conscious
of
the
*NL*
vicinity
of
the
heavy
Romanesque
pillars
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
these
edifices
of
the
transition
from
the
Romanesque
to
the
*NL*
Gothic
,
are
no
less
precious
for
study
than
the
pure
types
.
They
express
*NL*
a
shade
of
the
art
which
would
be
lost
without
them
.
It
is
the
graft
of
*NL*
the
pointed
upon
the
round
arch
.
*NL*
*NL*
Notre-Dame
de
Paris
is
,
in
particular
,
a
curious
specimen
of
this
*NL*
variety
.
Each
face
,
each
stone
of
the
venerable
monument
,
is
a
page
not
*NL*
only
of
the
history
of
the
country
,
but
of
the
history
of
science
and
*NL*
art
as
well
.
Thus
,
in
order
to
indicate
here
only
the
principal
details
,
*NL*
while
the
little
Red
Door
almost
attains
to
the
limits
of
the
Gothic
*NL*
delicacy
of
the
fifteenth
century
,
the
pillars
of
the
nave
,
by
their
*NL*
size
and
weight
,
go
back
to
the
Carlovingian
Abbey
of
Saint-Germain
des
*NL*
Pres.
One
would
suppose
that
six
centuries
separated
these
pillars
from
*NL*
that
door
.
There
is
no
one
,
not
even
the
hermetics
,
who
does
not
find
*NL*
in
the
symbols
of
the
grand
portal
a
satisfactory
compendium
of
their
*NL*
science
,
of
which
the
Church
of
Saint-Jacques
de
la
Boucherie
was
so
*NL*
complete
a
hieroglyph
.
Thus
,
the
Roman
abbey
,
the
philosophers
'
church
,
*NL*
the
Gothic
art
,
Saxon
art
,
the
heavy
,
round
pillar
,
which
recalls
*NL*
Gregory
VII.
,
the
hermetic
symbolism
,
with
which
Nicolas
Flamel
played
*NL*
the
prelude
to
Luther
,
papal
unity
,
schism
,
Saint-Germain
des
Pres
,
*NL*
Saint-Jacques
de
la
Boucherie
,
--
all
are
mingled
,
combined
,
amalgamated
*NL*
in
Notre-Dame
.
This
central
mother
church
is
,
among
the
ancient
churches
*NL*
of
Paris
,
a
sort
of
chimera
;
it
has
the
head
of
one
,
the
limbs
of
*NL*
another
,
the
haunches
of
another
,
something
of
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
repeat
it
,
these
hybrid
constructions
are
not
the
least
interesting
*NL*
for
the
artist
,
for
the
antiquarian
,
for
the
historian
.
They
make
*NL*
one
feel
to
what
a
degree
architecture
is
a
primitive
thing
,
by
*NL*
demonstrating
-LRB-
what
is
also
demonstrated
by
the
cyclopean
vestiges
,
*NL*
the
pyramids
of
Egypt
,
the
gigantic
Hindoo
pagodas
-RRB-
that
the
greatest
*NL*
products
of
architecture
are
less
the
works
of
individuals
than
of
*NL*
society
;
rather
the
offspring
of
a
nation
's
effort
,
than
the
inspired
*NL*
flash
of
a
man
of
genius
;
the
deposit
left
by
a
whole
people
;
the
heaps
*NL*
accumulated
by
centuries
;
the
residue
of
successive
evaporations
of
*NL*
human
society
,
--
in
a
word
,
species
of
formations
.
Each
wave
of
time
*NL*
contributes
its
alluvium
,
each
race
deposits
its
layer
on
the
monument
,
*NL*
each
individual
brings
his
stone
.
Thus
do
the
beavers
,
thus
do
the
bees
,
*NL*
thus
do
men
.
The
great
symbol
of
architecture
,
Babel
,
is
a
hive
.
*NL*
*NL*
Great
edifices
,
like
great
mountains
,
are
the
work
of
centuries
.
Art
*NL*
often
undergoes
a
transformation
while
they
are
pending
,
_
pendent
opera
*NL*
interrupta
_
;
they
proceed
quietly
in
accordance
with
the
transformed
*NL*
art
.
The
new
art
takes
the
monument
where
it
finds
it
,
incrusts
itself
*NL*
there
,
assimilates
it
to
itself
,
develops
it
according
to
its
fancy
,
*NL*
and
finishes
it
if
it
can
.
The
thing
is
accomplished
without
trouble
,
*NL*
without
effort
,
without
reaction
,
--
following
a
natural
and
tranquil
*NL*
law
.
It
is
a
graft
which
shoots
up
,
a
sap
which
circulates
,
a
vegetation
*NL*
which
starts
forth
anew
.
Certainly
there
is
matter
here
for
many
large
*NL*
volumes
,
and
often
the
universal
history
of
humanity
in
the
successive
*NL*
engrafting
of
many
arts
at
many
levels
,
upon
the
same
monument
.
The
man
,
*NL*
the
artist
,
the
individual
,
is
effaced
in
these
great
masses
,
which
*NL*
lack
the
name
of
their
author
;
human
intelligence
is
there
summed
up
and
*NL*
totalized
.
Time
is
the
architect
,
the
nation
is
the
builder
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
to
consider
here
anything
except
the
Christian
architecture
of
*NL*
Europe
,
that
younger
sister
of
the
great
masonries
of
the
Orient
,
*NL*
it
appears
to
the
eyes
as
an
immense
formation
divided
into
three
*NL*
well-defined
zones
,
which
are
superposed
,
the
one
upon
the
other
:
the
*NL*
Romanesque
zone
*
,
the
Gothic
zone
,
the
zone
of
the
Renaissance
,
which
*NL*
we
would
gladly
call
the
Greco-Roman
zone
.
The
Roman
layer
,
which
is
*NL*
the
most
ancient
and
deepest
,
is
occupied
by
the
round
arch
,
which
*NL*
reappears
,
supported
by
the
Greek
column
,
in
the
modern
and
upper
layer
*NL*
of
the
Renaissance
.
The
pointed
arch
is
found
between
the
two
.
The
*NL*
edifices
which
belong
exclusively
to
any
one
of
these
three
layers
*NL*
are
perfectly
distinct
,
uniform
,
and
complete
.
There
is
the
Abbey
of
*NL*
Jumieges
,
there
is
the
Cathedral
of
Reims
,
there
is
the
Sainte-Croix
of
*NL*
Orleans
.
But
the
three
zones
mingle
and
amalgamate
along
the
edges
,
like
*NL*
the
colors
in
the
solar
spectrum
.
Hence
,
complex
monuments
,
edifices
*NL*
of
gradation
and
transition
.
One
is
Roman
at
the
base
,
Gothic
in
the
*NL*
middle
,
Greco-Roman
at
the
top
.
It
is
because
it
was
six
hundred
years
*NL*
in
building
.
This
variety
is
rare
.
The
donjon
keep
of
d'Etampes
is
a
*NL*
specimen
of
it
.
But
monuments
of
two
formations
are
more
frequent
.
There
*NL*
is
Notre-Dame
de
Paris
,
a
pointed-arch
edifice
,
which
is
imbedded
by
*NL*
its
pillars
in
that
Roman
zone
,
in
which
are
plunged
the
portal
of
*NL*
Saint-Denis
,
and
the
nave
of
Saint-Germain
des
Pres.
There
is
the
*NL*
charming
,
half-Gothic
chapter-house
of
Bocherville
,
where
the
Roman
*NL*
layer
extends
half
way
up
.
There
is
the
cathedral
of
Rouen
,
which
would
*NL*
be
entirely
Gothic
if
it
did
not
bathe
the
tip
of
its
central
spire
in
*NL*
the
zone
of
the
Renaissance
.
**
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
This
is
the
same
which
is
called
,
according
to
locality
,
*NL*
climate
,
and
races
,
Lombard
,
Saxon
,
or
Byzantine
.
There
are
four
sister
*NL*
and
parallel
architectures
,
each
having
its
special
character
,
but
*NL*
derived
from
the
same
origin
,
the
round
arch
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
Facies
non
omnibus
una
,
*NL*
No
diversa
tamen
,
qualem
_
,
etc.
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
faces
not
all
alike
,
nor
yet
different
,
but
such
as
the
faces
of
*NL*
sisters
ought
to
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
**
This
portion
of
the
spire
,
which
was
of
woodwork
,
is
precisely
*NL*
that
which
was
consumed
by
lightning
,
in
1823
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
all
these
shades
,
all
these
differences
,
do
not
affect
the
*NL*
surfaces
of
edifices
only
.
It
is
art
which
has
changed
its
skin
.
The
*NL*
very
constitution
of
the
Christian
church
is
not
attacked
by
it
.
There
*NL*
is
always
the
same
internal
woodwork
,
the
same
logical
arrangement
*NL*
of
parts
.
Whatever
may
be
the
carved
and
embroidered
envelope
of
a
*NL*
cathedral
,
one
always
finds
beneath
it
--
in
the
state
of
a
germ
,
and
of
*NL*
a
rudiment
at
the
least
--
the
Roman
basilica
.
It
is
eternally
developed
*NL*
upon
the
soil
according
to
the
same
law
.
There
are
,
invariably
,
two
*NL*
naves
,
which
intersect
in
a
cross
,
and
whose
upper
portion
,
rounded
into
*NL*
an
apse
,
forms
the
choir
;
there
are
always
the
side
aisles
,
for
interior
*NL*
processions
,
for
chapels
,
--
a
sort
of
lateral
walks
or
promenades
where
*NL*
the
principal
nave
discharges
itself
through
the
spaces
between
the
*NL*
pillars
.
That
settled
,
the
number
of
chapels
,
doors
,
bell
towers
,
*NL*
and
pinnacles
are
modified
to
infinity
,
according
to
the
fancy
of
the
*NL*
century
,
the
people
,
and
art
.
The
service
of
religion
once
assured
*NL*
and
provided
for
,
architecture
does
what
she
pleases
.
Statues
,
*NL*
stained
glass
,
rose
windows
,
arabesques
,
denticulations
,
capitals
,
*NL*
bas-reliefs
,
--
she
combines
all
these
imaginings
according
to
the
*NL*
arrangement
which
best
suits
her
.
Hence
,
the
prodigious
exterior
variety
*NL*
of
these
edifices
,
at
whose
foundation
dwells
so
much
order
and
unity
.
*NL*
The
trunk
of
a
tree
is
immovable
;
the
foliage
is
capricious
.

We
have
just
attempted
to
restore
,
for
the
reader
's
benefit
,
that
*NL*
admirable
church
of
Notre-Dame
de
Paris
.
We
have
briefly
pointed
out
*NL*
the
greater
part
of
the
beauties
which
it
possessed
in
the
fifteenth
*NL*
century
,
and
which
it
lacks
to-day
;
but
we
have
omitted
the
principal
*NL*
thing
,
--
the
view
of
Paris
which
was
then
to
be
obtained
from
the
summits
*NL*
of
its
towers
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
,
in
fact
,
--
when
,
after
having
long
groped
one
's
way
up
the
dark
*NL*
spiral
which
perpendicularly
pierces
the
thick
wall
of
the
belfries
,
*NL*
one
emerged
,
at
last
abruptly
,
upon
one
of
the
lofty
platforms
inundated
*NL*
with
light
and
air
,
--
that
was
,
in
fact
,
a
fine
picture
which
spread
*NL*
out
,
on
all
sides
at
once
,
before
the
eye
;
a
spectacle
_
sui
generis
_
,
of
*NL*
which
those
of
our
readers
who
have
had
the
good
fortune
to
see
a
*NL*
Gothic
city
entire
,
complete
,
homogeneous
,
--
a
few
of
which
still
remain
,
*NL*
Nuremberg
in
Bavaria
and
Vittoria
in
Spain
,
--
can
readily
form
an
idea
;
*NL*
or
even
smaller
specimens
,
provided
that
they
are
well
preserved
,

*NL*
The
Paris
of
three
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
--
the
Paris
of
the
*NL*
fifteenth
century
--
was
already
a
gigantic
city
.
We
Parisians
generally
*NL*
make
a
mistake
as
to
the
ground
which
we
think
that
we
have
gained
,
*NL*
since
Paris
has
not
increased
much
over
one-third
since
the
time
of
*NL*
Louis
XI
.
It
has
certainly
lost
more
in
beauty
than
it
has
gained
in
*NL*
size
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paris
had
its
birth
,
as
the
reader
knows
,
in
that
old
island
of
the
City
*NL*
which
has
the
form
of
a
cradle
.
The
strand
of
that
island
was
its
*NL*
first
boundary
wall
,
the
Seine
its
first
moat
.
Paris
remained
for
many
*NL*
centuries
in
its
island
state
,
with
two
bridges
,
one
on
the
north
,
the
*NL*
other
on
the
south
;
and
two
bridge
heads
,
which
were
at
the
same
time
*NL*
its
gates
and
its
fortresses
,
--
the
Grand-Chatelet
on
the
right
bank
,
*NL*
the
Petit-Chatelet
on
the
left
.
Then
,
from
the
date
of
the
kings
of
the
*NL*
first
race
,
Paris
,
being
too
cribbed
and
confined
in
its
island
,
and
*NL*
unable
to
return
thither
,
crossed
the
water
.
Then
,
beyond
the
Grand
,
*NL*
beyond
the
Petit-Chatelet
,
a
first
circle
of
walls
and
towers
began
to
*NL*
infringe
upon
the
country
on
the
two
sides
of
the
Seine
.
Some
vestiges
*NL*
of
this
ancient
enclosure
still
remained
in
the
last
century
;
to-day
,
*NL*
only
the
memory
of
it
is
left
,
and
here
and
there
a
tradition
,
the
*NL*
Baudets
or
Baudoyer
gate
,
``
Porte
Bagauda
''
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
by
little
,
the
tide
of
houses
,
always
thrust
from
the
heart
of
*NL*
the
city
outwards
,
overflows
,
devours
,
wears
away
,
and
effaces
this
*NL*
wall
.
Philip
Augustus
makes
a
new
dike
for
it
.
He
imprisons
Paris
in
a
*NL*
circular
chain
of
great
towers
,
both
lofty
and
solid
.
For
the
period
of
*NL*
more
than
a
century
,
the
houses
press
upon
each
other
,
accumulate
,
and
*NL*
raise
their
level
in
this
basin
,
like
water
in
a
reservoir
.
They
begin
*NL*
to
deepen
;
they
pile
story
upon
story
;
they
mount
upon
each
other
;
they
*NL*
gush
forth
at
the
top
,
like
all
laterally
compressed
growth
,
and
there
*NL*
is
a
rivalry
as
to
which
shall
thrust
its
head
above
its
neighbors
,
for
*NL*
the
sake
of
getting
a
little
air
.
The
street
glows
narrower
and
deeper
,
*NL*
every
space
is
overwhelmed
and
disappears
.
The
houses
finally
leap
the
*NL*
wall
of
Philip
Augustus
,
and
scatter
joyfully
over
the
plain
,
without
*NL*
order
,
and
all
askew
,
like
runaways
.
There
they
plant
themselves
*NL*
squarely
,
cut
themselves
gardens
from
the
fields
,
and
take
their
*NL*
ease
.
Beginning
with
1367
,
the
city
spreads
to
such
an
extent
into
the
*NL*
suburbs
,
that
a
new
wall
becomes
necessary
,
particularly
on
the
right
*NL*
bank
;
Charles
V.
builds
it
.
But
a
city
like
Paris
is
perpetually
*NL*
growing
.
It
is
only
such
cities
that
become
capitals
.
They
are
funnels
,
*NL*
into
which
all
the
geographical
,
political
,
moral
,
and
intellectual
*NL*
water-sheds
of
a
country
,
all
the
natural
slopes
of
a
people
,
pour
;
*NL*
wells
of
civilization
,
so
to
speak
,
and
also
sewers
,
where
commerce
,
*NL*
industry
,
intelligence
,
population
,
--
all
that
is
sap
,
all
that
is
life
,
*NL*
all
that
is
the
soul
of
a
nation
,
filters
and
amasses
unceasingly
,
drop
*NL*
by
drop
,
century
by
century
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
So
Charles
V.
's
wall
suffered
the
fate
of
that
of
Philip
Augustus
.
At
*NL*
the
end
of
the
fifteenth
century
,
the
Faubourg
strides
across
it
,
passes
*NL*
beyond
it
,
and
runs
farther
.
In
the
sixteenth
,
it
seems
to
retreat
*NL*
visibly
,
and
to
bury
itself
deeper
and
deeper
in
the
old
city
,
so
thick
*NL*
had
the
new
city
already
become
outside
of
it
.
Thus
,
beginning
with
the
*NL*
fifteenth
century
,
where
our
story
finds
us
,
Paris
had
already
outgrown
*NL*
the
three
concentric
circles
of
walls
which
,
from
the
time
of
Julian
the
*NL*
Apostate
,
existed
,
so
to
speak
,
in
germ
in
the
Grand-Chatelet
and
the
*NL*
Petit-Chatelet
.
The
mighty
city
had
cracked
,
in
succession
,
its
four
*NL*
enclosures
of
walls
,
like
a
child
grown
too
large
for
his
garments
of
*NL*
last
year
.
Under
Louis
XI.
,
this
sea
of
houses
was
seen
to
be
pierced
*NL*
at
intervals
by
several
groups
of
ruined
towers
,
from
the
ancient
wall
,
*NL*
like
the
summits
of
hills
in
an
inundation
,
--
like
archipelagos
of
the
*NL*
old
Paris
submerged
beneath
the
new
.
Since
that
time
Paris
has
undergone
*NL*
yet
another
transformation
,
unfortunately
for
our
eyes
;
but
it
has
*NL*
passed
only
one
more
wall
,
that
of
Louis
XV.
,
that
miserable
wall
of
*NL*
mud
and
spittle
,
worthy
of
the
king
who
built
it
,
worthy
of
the
poet
who
*NL*
sung
it
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
_
Le
mur
murant
Paris
rend
Paris
murmurant
_
.
*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
The
wall
walling
Paris
makes
Paris
murmur
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
fifteenth
century
,
Paris
was
still
divided
into
three
wholly
*NL*
distinct
and
separate
towns
,
each
having
its
own
physiognomy
,
its
own
*NL*
specialty
,
its
manners
,
customs
,
privileges
,
and
history
:
the
City
,
the
*NL*
University
,
the
Town
.
The
City
,
which
occupied
the
island
,
was
the
*NL*
most
ancient
,
the
smallest
,
and
the
mother
of
the
other
two
,
crowded
in
*NL*
between
them
like
-LRB-
may
we
be
pardoned
the
comparison
-RRB-
a
little
old
woman
*NL*
between
two
large
and
handsome
maidens
.
The
University
covered
the
left
*NL*
bank
of
the
Seine
,
from
the
Tournelle
to
the
Tour
de
Nesle
,
points
which
*NL*
correspond
in
the
Paris
of
to-day
,
the
one
to
the
wine
market
,
the
other
*NL*
to
the
mint
.
Its
wall
included
a
large
part
of
that
plain
where
Julian
*NL*
had
built
his
hot
baths
.
The
hill
of
Sainte-Genevieve
was
enclosed
in
*NL*
it
.
The
culminating
point
of
this
sweep
of
walls
was
the
Papal
gate
,
*NL*
that
is
to
say
,
near
the
present
site
of
the
Pantheon
.
The
Town
,
which
*NL*
was
the
largest
of
the
three
fragments
of
Paris
,
held
the
right
bank
.
*NL*
Its
quay
,
broken
or
interrupted
in
many
places
,
ran
along
the
Seine
,
*NL*
from
the
Tour
de
Billy
to
the
Tour
du
Bois
;
that
is
to
say
,
from
the
*NL*
place
where
the
granary
stands
to-day
,
to
the
present
site
of
the
*NL*
Tuileries
.
These
four
points
,
where
the
Seine
intersected
the
wall
of
*NL*
the
capital
,
the
Tournelle
and
the
Tour
de
Nesle
on
the
right
,
the
Tour
*NL*
de
Billy
and
the
Tour
du
Bois
on
the
left
,
were
called
pre-eminently
,
*NL*
``
the
four
towers
of
Paris
.
''
The
Town
encroached
still
more
extensively
*NL*
upon
the
fields
than
the
University
.
The
culminating
point
of
the
*NL*
Town
wall
-LRB-
that
of
Charles
V.
-RRB-
was
at
the
gates
of
Saint-Denis
and
*NL*
Saint-Martin
,
whose
situation
has
not
been
changed
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
have
just
said
,
each
of
these
three
great
divisions
of
Paris
was
a
*NL*
town
,
but
too
special
a
town
to
be
complete
,
a
city
which
could
not
*NL*
get
along
without
the
other
two
.
Hence
three
entirely
distinct
aspects
:
*NL*
churches
abounded
in
the
City
;
palaces
,
in
the
Town
;
and
colleges
,
*NL*
in
the
University
.
Neglecting
here
the
originalities
,
of
secondary
*NL*
importance
in
old
Paris
,
and
the
capricious
regulations
regarding
the
*NL*
public
highways
,
we
will
say
,
from
a
general
point
of
view
,
taking
only
*NL*
masses
and
the
whole
group
,
in
this
chaos
of
communal
jurisdictions
,
*NL*
that
the
island
belonged
to
the
bishop
,
the
right
bank
to
the
provost
of
*NL*
the
merchants
,
the
left
bank
to
the
Rector
;
over
all
ruled
the
provost
*NL*
of
Paris
,
a
royal
not
a
municipal
official
.
The
City
had
Notre-Dame
;
the
*NL*
Town
,
the
Louvre
and
the
Hotel
de
Ville
;
the
University
,
the
Sorbonne
.
*NL*
The
Town
had
the
markets
-LRB-
Halles
-RRB-
;
the
city
,
the
Hospital
;
the
*NL*
University
,
the
Pre-aux-Clercs
.
Offences
committed
by
the
scholars
*NL*
on
the
left
bank
were
tried
in
the
law
courts
on
the
island
,
and
were
*NL*
punished
on
the
right
bank
at
Montfaucon
;
unless
the
rector
,
feeling
the
*NL*
university
to
be
strong
and
the
king
weak
,
intervened
;
for
it
was
the
*NL*
students
'
privilege
to
be
hanged
on
their
own
grounds
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
greater
part
of
these
privileges
,
it
may
be
noted
in
passing
,
and
*NL*
there
were
some
even
better
than
the
above
,
had
been
extorted
from
the
*NL*
kings
by
revolts
and
mutinies
.
It
is
the
course
of
things
from
time
*NL*
immemorial
;
the
king
only
lets
go
when
the
people
tear
away
.
There
is
an
*NL*
old
charter
which
puts
the
matter
naively
:
apropos
of
fidelity
:
_
Civibus
*NL*
fidelitas
in
reges
,
quae
tamen
aliquoties
seditionibus
interrypta
,
multa
*NL*
peperit
privileyia
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
fifteenth
century
,
the
Seine
bathed
five
islands
within
the
walls
*NL*
of
Paris
:
Louviers
island
,
where
there
were
then
trees
,
and
where
there
*NL*
is
no
longer
anything
but
wood
;
l'ile
aux
Vaches
,
and
l'ile
Notre-Dame
,
*NL*
both
deserted
,
with
the
exception
of
one
house
,
both
fiefs
of
the
*NL*
bishop
--
in
the
seventeenth
century
,
a
single
island
was
formed
out
of
*NL*
these
two
,
which
was
built
upon
and
named
l'ile
Saint-Louis
--
,
lastly
*NL*
the
City
,
and
at
its
point
,
the
little
islet
of
the
cow
tender
,
which
*NL*
was
afterwards
engulfed
beneath
the
platform
of
the
Pont-Neuf
.
The
City
*NL*
then
had
five
bridges
:
three
on
the
right
,
the
Pont
Notre-Dame
,
and
the
*NL*
Pont
au
Change
,
of
stone
,
the
Pont
aux
Meuniers
,
of
wood
;
two
on
the
*NL*
left
,
the
Petit
Pont
,
of
stone
,
the
Pont
Saint-Michel
,
of
wood
;
all
*NL*
loaded
with
houses
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
University
had
six
gates
,
built
by
Philip
Augustus
;
there
were
,
*NL*
beginning
with
la
Tournelle
,
the
Porte
Saint-Victor
,
the
Porte
Bordelle
,
*NL*
the
Porte
Papale
,
the
Porte
Saint-Jacques
,
the
Porte
Saint-Michel
,
*NL*
the
Porte
Saint-Germain
.
The
Town
had
six
gates
,
built
by
Charles
V.
;
*NL*
beginning
with
the
Tour
de
Billy
they
were
:
the
Porte
Saint-Antoine
,
*NL*
the
Porte
du
Temple
,
the
Porte
Saint-Martin
,
the
Porte
Saint-Denis
,
the
*NL*
Porte
Montmartre
,
the
Porte
Saint-Honore
.
All
these
gates
were
strong
,
*NL*
and
also
handsome
,
which
does
not
detract
from
strength
.
A
large
,
deep
*NL*
moat
,
with
a
brisk
current
during
the
high
water
of
winter
,
bathed
the
*NL*
base
of
the
wall
round
Paris
;
the
Seine
furnished
the
water
.
At
night
,
*NL*
the
gates
were
shut
,
the
river
was
barred
at
both
ends
of
the
city
with
*NL*
huge
iron
chains
,
and
Paris
slept
tranquilly
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
a
bird
's
-
eye
view
,
these
three
burgs
,
the
City
,
the
Town
,
and
*NL*
the
University
,
each
presented
to
the
eye
an
inextricable
skein
of
*NL*
eccentrically
tangled
streets
.
Nevertheless
,
at
first
sight
,
one
*NL*
recognized
the
fact
that
these
three
fragments
formed
but
one
body
.
*NL*
One
immediately
perceived
three
long
parallel
streets
,
unbroken
,
*NL*
undisturbed
,
traversing
,
almost
in
a
straight
line
,
all
three
cities
,
*NL*
from
one
end
to
the
other
;
from
North
to
South
,
perpendicularly
,
to
the
*NL*
Seine
,
which
bound
them
together
,
mingled
them
,
infused
them
in
each
*NL*
other
,
poured
and
transfused
the
people
incessantly
,
from
one
to
the
*NL*
other
,
and
made
one
out
of
the
three
.
The
first
of
these
streets
ran
*NL*
from
the
Porte
Saint-Martin
:
it
was
called
the
Rue
Saint-Jacques
in
*NL*
the
University
,
Rue
de
la
Juiverie
in
the
City
,
Rue
Saint-Martin
in
the
*NL*
Town
;
it
crossed
the
water
twice
,
under
the
name
of
the
Petit
Pont
and
*NL*
the
Pont
Notre-Dame
.
The
second
,
which
was
called
the
Rue
de
la
Harpe
*NL*
on
the
left
bank
,
Rue
de
la
Barillerie
in
the
island
,
Rue
Saint-Denis
*NL*
on
the
right
bank
,
Pont
Saint-Michel
on
one
arm
of
the
Seine
,
Pont
au
*NL*
Change
on
the
other
,
ran
from
the
Porte
Saint-Michel
in
the
University
,
*NL*
to
the
Porte
Saint-Denis
in
the
Town
.
However
,
under
all
these
names
,
*NL*
there
were
but
two
streets
,
parent
streets
,
generating
streets
,
--
the
two
*NL*
arteries
of
Paris
.
All
the
other
veins
of
the
triple
city
either
derived
*NL*
their
supply
from
them
or
emptied
into
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Independently
of
these
two
principal
streets
,
piercing
Paris
*NL*
diametrically
in
its
whole
breadth
,
from
side
to
side
,
common
to
the
*NL*
entire
capital
,
the
City
and
the
University
had
also
each
its
own
great
*NL*
special
street
,
which
ran
lengthwise
by
them
,
parallel
to
the
Seine
,
*NL*
cutting
,
as
it
passed
,
at
right
angles
,
the
two
arterial
thoroughfares
.
*NL*
Thus
,
in
the
Town
,
one
descended
in
a
straight
line
from
the
Porte
*NL*
Saint-Antoine
to
the
Porte
Saint-Honore
;
in
the
University
from
*NL*
the
Porte
Saint-Victor
to
the
Porte
Saint-Germain
.
These
two
great
*NL*
thoroughfares
intersected
by
the
two
first
,
formed
the
canvas
upon
which
*NL*
reposed
,
knotted
and
crowded
together
on
every
hand
,
the
labyrinthine
*NL*
network
of
the
streets
of
Paris
.
In
the
incomprehensible
plan
of
*NL*
these
streets
,
one
distinguished
likewise
,
on
looking
attentively
,
two
*NL*
clusters
of
great
streets
,
like
magnified
sheaves
of
grain
,
one
in
the
*NL*
University
,
the
other
in
the
Town
,
which
spread
out
gradually
from
the
*NL*
bridges
to
the
gates
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
traces
of
this
geometrical
plan
still
exist
to-day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
what
aspect
did
this
whole
present
,
when
,
as
viewed
from
the
summit
*NL*
of
the
towers
of
Notre-Dame
,
in
1482
?
That
we
shall
try
to
describe
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
spectator
who
arrived
,
panting
,
upon
that
pinnacle
,
it
was
first
*NL*
a
dazzling
confusing
view
of
roofs
,
chimneys
,
streets
,
bridges
,
places
,
*NL*
spires
,
bell
towers
.
Everything
struck
your
eye
at
once
:
the
carved
*NL*
gable
,
the
pointed
roof
,
the
turrets
suspended
at
the
angles
of
the
*NL*
walls
;
the
stone
pyramids
of
the
eleventh
century
,
the
slate
obelisks
of
*NL*
the
fifteenth
;
the
round
,
bare
tower
of
the
donjon
keep
;
the
square
and
*NL*
fretted
tower
of
the
church
;
the
great
and
the
little
,
the
massive
and
*NL*
the
aerial
.
The
eye
was
,
for
a
long
time
,
wholly
lost
in
this
labyrinth
,
*NL*
where
there
was
nothing
which
did
not
possess
its
originality
,
its
*NL*
reason
,
its
genius
,
its
beauty
,
--
nothing
which
did
not
proceed
from
art
;
*NL*
beginning
with
the
smallest
house
,
with
its
painted
and
carved
front
,
*NL*
with
external
beams
,
elliptical
door
,
with
projecting
stories
,
to
the
*NL*
royal
Louvre
,
which
then
had
a
colonnade
of
towers
.
But
these
are
the
*NL*
principal
masses
which
were
then
to
be
distinguished
when
the
eye
began
*NL*
to
accustom
itself
to
this
tumult
of
edifices
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
first
place
,
the
City
.
--
``
The
island
of
the
City
,
''
as
Sauval
says
,
*NL*
who
,
in
spite
of
his
confused
medley
,
sometimes
has
such
happy
turns
of
*NL*
expression
,
--
``
the
island
of
the
city
is
made
like
a
great
ship
,
stuck
in
*NL*
the
mud
and
run
aground
in
the
current
,
near
the
centre
of
the
Seine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
just
explained
that
,
in
the
fifteenth
century
,
this
ship
was
*NL*
anchored
to
the
two
banks
of
the
river
by
five
bridges
.
This
form
of
a
*NL*
ship
had
also
struck
the
heraldic
scribes
;
for
it
is
from
that
,
and
*NL*
not
from
the
siege
by
the
Normans
,
that
the
ship
which
blazons
the
old
*NL*
shield
of
Paris
,
comes
,
according
to
Favyn
and
Pasquier
.
For
him
*NL*
who
understands
how
to
decipher
them
,
armorial
bearings
are
algebra
,
*NL*
armorial
bearings
have
a
tongue
.
The
whole
history
of
the
second
half
of
*NL*
the
Middle
Ages
is
written
in
armorial
bearings
,
--
the
first
half
is
*NL*
in
the
symbolism
of
the
Roman
churches
.
They
are
the
hieroglyphics
of
*NL*
feudalism
,
succeeding
those
of
theocracy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
the
City
first
presented
itself
to
the
eye
,
with
its
stern
to
the
*NL*
east
,
and
its
prow
to
the
west
.
Turning
towards
the
prow
,
one
had
before
*NL*
one
an
innumerable
flock
of
ancient
roofs
,
over
which
arched
broadly
the
*NL*
lead-covered
apse
of
the
Sainte-Chapelle
,
like
an
elephant
's
haunches
*NL*
loaded
with
its
tower
.
Only
here
,
this
tower
was
the
most
audacious
,
the
*NL*
most
open
,
the
most
ornamented
spire
of
cabinet-maker
's
work
that
ever
*NL*
let
the
sky
peep
through
its
cone
of
lace
.
In
front
of
Notre-Dame
,
and
*NL*
very
near
at
hand
,
three
streets
opened
into
the
cathedral
square
,
--
a
*NL*
fine
square
,
lined
with
ancient
houses
.
Over
the
south
side
of
this
*NL*
place
bent
the
wrinkled
and
sullen
facade
of
the
Hotel
Dieu
,
and
its
*NL*
roof
,
which
seemed
covered
with
warts
and
pustules
.
Then
,
on
the
right
*NL*
and
the
left
,
to
east
and
west
,
within
that
wall
of
the
City
,
which
was
*NL*
yet
so
contracted
,
rose
the
bell
towers
of
its
one
and
twenty
churches
,
*NL*
of
every
date
,
of
every
form
,
of
every
size
,
from
the
low
and
wormeaten
*NL*
belfry
of
Saint-Denis
du
Pas
-LRB-
_
Carcer
Glaueini
_
-RRB-
to
the
slender
needles
*NL*
of
Saint-Pierre
aux
Boeufs
and
Saint-Landry
.
*NL*
*NL*
Behind
Notre-Dame
,
the
cloister
and
its
Gothic
galleries
spread
out
*NL*
towards
the
north
;
on
the
south
,
the
half-Roman
palace
of
the
bishop
;
on
*NL*
the
east
,
the
desert
point
of
the
Terrain
.
In
this
throng
of
houses
the
*NL*
eye
also
distinguished
,
by
the
lofty
open-work
mitres
of
stone
which
*NL*
then
crowned
the
roof
itself
,
even
the
most
elevated
windows
of
the
*NL*
palace
,
the
Hotel
given
by
the
city
,
under
Charles
VI.
,
to
Juvenal
*NL*
des
Ursins
;
a
little
farther
on
,
the
pitch-covered
sheds
of
the
Palus
*NL*
Market
;
in
still
another
quarter
the
new
apse
of
Saint-Germain
le
Vieux
,
*NL*
lengthened
in
1458
,
with
a
bit
of
the
Rue
aux
Febves
;
and
then
,
in
*NL*
places
,
a
square
crowded
with
people
;
a
pillory
,
erected
at
the
corner
*NL*
of
a
street
;
a
fine
fragment
of
the
pavement
of
Philip
Augustus
,
a
*NL*
magnificent
flagging
,
grooved
for
the
horses
'
feet
,
in
the
middle
of
the
*NL*
road
,
and
so
badly
replaced
in
the
sixteenth
century
by
the
miserable
*NL*
cobblestones
,
called
the
``
pavement
of
the
League
;
''
a
deserted
back
*NL*
courtyard
,
with
one
of
those
diaphanous
staircase
turrets
,
such
as
were
*NL*
erected
in
the
fifteenth
century
,
one
of
which
is
still
to
be
seen
in
*NL*
the
Rue
des
Bourdonnais
.
Lastly
,
at
the
right
of
the
Sainte-Chapelle
,
*NL*
towards
the
west
,
the
Palais
de
Justice
rested
its
group
of
towers
at
*NL*
the
edge
of
the
water
.
The
thickets
of
the
king
's
gardens
,
which
covered
*NL*
the
western
point
of
the
City
,
masked
the
Island
du
Passeur
.
As
for
the
*NL*
water
,
from
the
summit
of
the
towers
of
Notre-Dame
one
hardly
saw
it
,
on
*NL*
either
side
of
the
City
;
the
Seine
was
hidden
by
bridges
,
the
bridges
by
*NL*
houses
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
when
the
glance
passed
these
bridges
,
whose
roofs
were
visibly
*NL*
green
,
rendered
mouldy
before
their
time
by
the
vapors
from
the
water
,
*NL*
if
it
was
directed
to
the
left
,
towards
the
University
,
the
first
*NL*
edifice
which
struck
it
was
a
large
,
low
sheaf
of
towers
,
the
*NL*
Petit-Chatelet
,
whose
yawning
gate
devoured
the
end
of
the
Petit-Pont
.
*NL*
Then
,
if
your
view
ran
along
the
bank
,
from
east
to
west
,
from
the
*NL*
Tournelle
to
the
Tour
de
Nesle
,
there
was
a
long
cordon
of
houses
,
with
*NL*
carved
beams
,
stained-glass
windows
,
each
story
projecting
over
that
*NL*
beneath
it
,
an
interminable
zigzag
of
bourgeois
gables
,
frequently
*NL*
interrupted
by
the
mouth
of
a
street
,
and
from
time
to
time
also
by
the
*NL*
front
or
angle
of
a
huge
stone
mansion
,
planted
at
its
ease
,
with
courts
*NL*
and
gardens
,
wings
and
detached
buildings
,
amid
this
populace
of
crowded
*NL*
and
narrow
houses
,
like
a
grand
gentleman
among
a
throng
of
rustics
.
*NL*
There
were
five
or
six
of
these
mansions
on
the
quay
,
from
the
house
of
*NL*
Lorraine
,
which
shared
with
the
Bernardins
the
grand
enclosure
adjoining
*NL*
the
Tournelle
,
to
the
Hotel
de
Nesle
,
whose
principal
tower
ended
Paris
,
*NL*
and
whose
pointed
roofs
were
in
a
position
,
during
three
months
of
the
*NL*
year
,
to
encroach
,
with
their
black
triangles
,
upon
the
scarlet
disk
of
*NL*
the
setting
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
side
of
the
Seine
was
,
however
,
the
least
mercantile
of
the
two
.
*NL*
Students
furnished
more
of
a
crowd
and
more
noise
there
than
artisans
,
*NL*
and
there
was
not
,
properly
speaking
,
any
quay
,
except
from
the
Pont
*NL*
Saint-Michel
to
the
Tour
de
Nesle
.
The
rest
of
the
bank
of
the
Seine
was
*NL*
now
a
naked
strand
,
the
same
as
beyond
the
Bernardins
;
again
,
a
throng
*NL*
of
houses
,
standing
with
their
feet
in
the
water
,
as
between
the
two
*NL*
bridges
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
great
uproar
of
laundresses
;
they
screamed
,
and
talked
,
and
*NL*
sang
from
morning
till
night
along
the
beach
,
and
beat
a
great
deal
of
*NL*
linen
there
,
just
as
in
our
day
.
This
is
not
the
least
of
the
gayeties
*NL*
of
Paris
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
University
presented
a
dense
mass
to
the
eye
.
From
one
end
to
*NL*
the
other
,
it
was
homogeneous
and
compact
.
The
thousand
roofs
,
dense
,
*NL*
angular
,
clinging
to
each
other
,
composed
,
nearly
all
,
of
the
same
*NL*
geometrical
element
,
offered
,
when
viewed
from
above
,
the
aspect
of
a
*NL*
crystallization
of
the
same
substance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
capricious
ravine
of
streets
did
not
cut
this
block
of
houses
into
*NL*
too
disproportionate
slices
.
The
forty-two
colleges
were
scattered
about
*NL*
in
a
fairly
equal
manner
,
and
there
were
some
everywhere
.
The
amusingly
*NL*
varied
crests
of
these
beautiful
edifices
were
the
product
of
the
same
*NL*
art
as
the
simple
roofs
which
they
overshot
,
and
were
,
actually
,
only
a
*NL*
multiplication
of
the
square
or
the
cube
of
the
same
geometrical
*NL*
figure
.
Hence
they
complicated
the
whole
effect
,
without
disturbing
*NL*
it
;
completed
,
without
overloading
it
.
Geometry
is
harmony
.
Some
*NL*
fine
mansions
here
and
there
made
magnificent
outlines
against
the
*NL*
picturesque
attics
of
the
left
bank
.
The
house
of
Nevers
,
the
house
of
*NL*
Rome
,
the
house
of
Reims
,
which
have
disappeared
;
the
Hotel
de
Cluny
,
*NL*
which
still
exists
,
for
the
consolation
of
the
artist
,
and
whose
tower
*NL*
was
so
stupidly
deprived
of
its
crown
a
few
years
ago
.
Close
to
Cluny
,
*NL*
that
Roman
palace
,
with
fine
round
arches
,
were
once
the
hot
baths
of
*NL*
Julian
.
There
were
a
great
many
abbeys
,
of
a
beauty
more
devout
,
of
a
*NL*
grandeur
more
solemn
than
the
mansions
,
but
not
less
beautiful
,
not
less
*NL*
grand
.
Those
which
first
caught
the
eye
were
the
Bernardins
,
with
their
*NL*
three
bell
towers
;
Sainte-Genevieve
,
whose
square
tower
,
which
still
*NL*
exists
,
makes
us
regret
the
rest
;
the
Sorbonne
,
half
college
,
half
*NL*
monastery
,
of
which
so
admirable
a
nave
survives
;
the
fine
quadrilateral
*NL*
cloister
of
the
Mathurins
;
its
neighbor
,
the
cloister
of
Saint-Benoit
,
*NL*
within
whose
walls
they
have
had
time
to
cobble
up
a
theatre
,
between
*NL*
the
seventh
and
eighth
editions
of
this
book
;
the
Cordeliers
,
with
their
*NL*
three
enormous
adjacent
gables
;
the
Augustins
,
whose
graceful
spire
*NL*
formed
,
after
the
Tour
de
Nesle
,
the
second
denticulation
on
this
side
*NL*
of
Paris
,
starting
from
the
west
.
The
colleges
,
which
are
,
in
fact
,
the
*NL*
intermediate
ring
between
the
cloister
and
the
world
,
hold
the
middle
*NL*
position
in
the
monumental
series
between
the
Hotels
and
the
abbeys
,
*NL*
with
a
severity
full
of
elegance
,
sculpture
less
giddy
than
the
palaces
,
*NL*
an
architecture
less
severe
than
the
convents
.
Unfortunately
,
hardly
*NL*
anything
remains
of
these
monuments
,
where
Gothic
art
combined
with
*NL*
so
just
a
balance
,
richness
and
economy
.
The
churches
-LRB-
and
they
were
*NL*
numerous
and
splendid
in
the
University
,
and
they
were
graded
there
also
*NL*
in
all
the
ages
of
architecture
,
from
the
round
arches
of
Saint-Julian
*NL*
to
the
pointed
arches
of
Saint-Severin
-RRB-
,
the
churches
dominated
the
*NL*
whole
;
and
,
like
one
harmony
more
in
this
mass
of
harmonies
,
they
*NL*
pierced
in
quick
succession
the
multiple
open
work
of
the
gables
with
*NL*
slashed
spires
,
with
open-work
bell
towers
,
with
slender
pinnacles
,
*NL*
whose
line
was
also
only
a
magnificent
exaggeration
of
the
acute
angle
*NL*
of
the
roofs
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ground
of
the
University
was
hilly
;
Mount
Sainte-Genevieve
formed
an
*NL*
enormous
mound
to
the
south
;
and
it
was
a
sight
to
see
from
the
summit
*NL*
of
Notre-Dame
how
that
throng
of
narrow
and
tortuous
streets
-LRB-
to-day
*NL*
the
Latin
Quarter
-RRB-
,
those
bunches
of
houses
which
,
spread
out
in
every
*NL*
direction
from
the
top
of
this
eminence
,
precipitated
themselves
in
*NL*
disorder
,
and
almost
perpendicularly
down
its
flanks
,
nearly
to
the
*NL*
water
's
edge
,
having
the
air
,
some
of
falling
,
others
of
clambering
up
*NL*
again
,
and
all
of
holding
to
one
another
.
A
continual
flux
of
a
thousand
*NL*
black
points
which
passed
each
other
on
the
pavements
made
everything
*NL*
move
before
the
eyes
;
it
was
the
populace
seen
thus
from
aloft
and
afar
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lastly
,
in
the
intervals
of
these
roofs
,
of
these
spires
,
of
these
*NL*
accidents
of
numberless
edifices
,
which
bent
and
writhed
,
and
jagged
in
*NL*
so
eccentric
a
manner
the
extreme
line
of
the
University
,
one
caught
a
*NL*
glimpse
,
here
and
there
,
of
a
great
expanse
of
moss-grown
wall
,
a
thick
,
*NL*
round
tower
,
a
crenellated
city
gate
,
shadowing
forth
the
fortress
;
*NL*
it
was
the
wall
of
Philip
Augustus
.
Beyond
,
the
fields
gleamed
green
;
*NL*
beyond
,
fled
the
roads
,
along
which
were
scattered
a
few
more
suburban
*NL*
houses
,
which
became
more
infrequent
as
they
became
more
distant
.
Some
*NL*
of
these
faubourgs
were
important
:
there
were
,
first
,
starting
from
la
*NL*
Tournelle
,
the
Bourg
Saint-Victor
,
with
its
one
arch
bridge
over
the
*NL*
Bievre
,
its
abbey
where
one
could
read
the
epitaph
of
Louis
le
Gros
,
*NL*
_
epitaphium
Ludovici
Grossi
_
,
and
its
church
with
an
octagonal
spire
,
*NL*
flanked
with
four
little
bell
towers
of
the
eleventh
century
-LRB-
a
similar
*NL*
one
can
be
seen
at
Etampes
;
it
is
not
yet
destroyed
-RRB-
;
next
,
the
Bourg
*NL*
Saint-Marceau
,
which
already
had
three
churches
and
one
convent
;
then
,
*NL*
leaving
the
mill
of
the
Gobelins
and
its
four
white
walls
on
the
left
,
*NL*
there
was
the
Faubourg
Saint-Jacques
with
the
beautiful
carved
cross
*NL*
in
its
square
;
the
church
of
Saint-Jacques
du
Haut-Pas
,
which
was
then
*NL*
Gothic
,
pointed
,
charming
;
Saint-Magloire
,
a
fine
nave
of
the
fourteenth
*NL*
century
,
which
Napoleon
turned
into
a
hayloft
;
Notre-Dame
des
Champs
,
*NL*
where
there
were
Byzantine
mosaics
;
lastly
,
after
having
left
behind
,
*NL*
full
in
the
country
,
the
Monastery
des
Chartreux
,
a
rich
edifice
*NL*
contemporary
with
the
Palais
de
Justice
,
with
its
little
garden
divided
*NL*
into
compartments
,
and
the
haunted
ruins
of
Vauvert
,
the
eye
fell
,
to
*NL*
the
west
,
upon
the
three
Roman
spires
of
Saint-Germain
des
Pres.
The
*NL*
Bourg
Saint-Germain
,
already
a
large
community
,
formed
fifteen
or
twenty
*NL*
streets
in
the
rear
;
the
pointed
bell
tower
of
Saint-Sulpice
marked
*NL*
one
corner
of
the
town
.
Close
beside
it
one
descried
the
quadrilateral
*NL*
enclosure
of
the
fair
of
Saint-Germain
,
where
the
market
is
situated
*NL*
to-day
;
then
the
abbot
's
pillory
,
a
pretty
little
round
tower
,
well
*NL*
capped
with
a
leaden
cone
;
the
brickyard
was
further
on
,
and
the
Rue
du
*NL*
Four
,
which
led
to
the
common
bakehouse
,
and
the
mill
on
its
hillock
,
*NL*
and
the
lazar
house
,
a
tiny
house
,
isolated
and
half
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
that
which
attracted
the
eye
most
of
all
,
and
fixed
it
for
a
long
*NL*
time
on
that
point
,
was
the
abbey
itself
.
It
is
certain
that
this
*NL*
monastery
,
which
had
a
grand
air
,
both
as
a
church
and
as
a
seignory
;
*NL*
that
abbatial
palace
,
where
the
bishops
of
Paris
counted
themselves
*NL*
happy
if
they
could
pass
the
night
;
that
refectory
,
upon
which
the
*NL*
architect
had
bestowed
the
air
,
the
beauty
,
and
the
rose
window
of
a
*NL*
cathedral
;
that
elegant
chapel
of
the
Virgin
;
that
monumental
dormitory
;
*NL*
those
vast
gardens
;
that
portcullis
;
that
drawbridge
;
that
envelope
*NL*
of
battlements
which
notched
to
the
eye
the
verdure
of
the
surrounding
*NL*
meadows
;
those
courtyards
,
where
gleamed
men
at
arms
,
intermingled
with
*NL*
golden
copes
;
--
the
whole
grouped
and
clustered
about
three
lofty
spires
,
*NL*
with
round
arches
,
well
planted
upon
a
Gothic
apse
,
made
a
magnificent
*NL*
figure
against
the
horizon
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
,
at
length
,
after
having
contemplated
the
University
for
a
long
*NL*
time
,
you
turned
towards
the
right
bank
,
towards
the
Town
,
the
character
*NL*
of
the
spectacle
was
abruptly
altered
.
The
Town
,
in
fact
much
larger
*NL*
than
the
University
,
was
also
less
of
a
unit
.
At
the
first
glance
,
one
*NL*
saw
that
it
was
divided
into
many
masses
,
singularly
distinct
.
First
,
to
*NL*
the
eastward
,
in
that
part
of
the
town
which
still
takes
its
name
from
*NL*
the
marsh
where
Camulogenes
entangled
Caesar
,
was
a
pile
of
palaces
.
The
*NL*
block
extended
to
the
very
water
's
edge
.
Four
almost
contiguous
Hotels
,
*NL*
Jouy
,
Sens
,
Barbeau
,
the
house
of
the
Queen
,
mirrored
their
slate
peaks
,
*NL*
broken
with
slender
turrets
,
in
the
Seine
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
four
edifices
filled
the
space
from
the
Rue
des
Nonaindieres
,
to
*NL*
the
abbey
of
the
Celestins
,
whose
spire
gracefully
relieved
their
line
*NL*
of
gables
and
battlements
.
A
few
miserable
,
greenish
hovels
,
hanging
*NL*
over
the
water
in
front
of
these
sumptuous
Hotels
,
did
not
prevent
*NL*
one
from
seeing
the
fine
angles
of
their
facades
,
their
large
,
square
*NL*
windows
with
stone
mullions
,
their
pointed
porches
overloaded
with
*NL*
statues
,
the
vivid
outlines
of
their
walls
,
always
clear
cut
,
and
all
*NL*
those
charming
accidents
of
architecture
,
which
cause
Gothic
art
to
have
*NL*
the
air
of
beginning
its
combinations
afresh
with
every
monument
.
*NL*
*NL*
Behind
these
palaces
,
extended
in
all
directions
,
now
broken
,
fenced
in
,
*NL*
battlemented
like
a
citadel
,
now
veiled
by
great
trees
like
a
Carthusian
*NL*
convent
,
the
immense
and
multiform
enclosure
of
that
miraculous
Hotel
*NL*
de
Saint-Pol
,
where
the
King
of
France
possessed
the
means
of
lodging
*NL*
superbly
two
and
twenty
princes
of
the
rank
of
the
dauphin
and
the
Duke
*NL*
of
Burgundy
,
with
their
domestics
and
their
suites
,
without
counting
the
*NL*
great
lords
,
and
the
emperor
when
he
came
to
view
Paris
,
and
the
lions
,
*NL*
who
had
their
separate
Hotel
at
the
royal
Hotel
.
Let
us
say
here
that
*NL*
a
prince
's
apartment
was
then
composed
of
never
less
than
eleven
large
*NL*
rooms
,
from
the
chamber
of
state
to
the
oratory
,
not
to
mention
the
*NL*
galleries
,
baths
,
vapor-baths
,
and
other
``
superfluous
places
,
''
with
*NL*
which
each
apartment
was
provided
;
not
to
mention
the
private
gardens
*NL*
for
each
of
the
king
's
guests
;
not
to
mention
the
kitchens
,
the
*NL*
cellars
,
the
domestic
offices
,
the
general
refectories
of
the
house
,
the
*NL*
poultry-yards
,
where
there
were
twenty-two
general
laboratories
,
from
*NL*
the
bakehouses
to
the
wine-cellars
;
games
of
a
thousand
sorts
,
malls
,
*NL*
tennis
,
and
riding
at
the
ring
;
aviaries
,
fishponds
,
menageries
,
*NL*
stables
,
barns
,
libraries
,
arsenals
and
foundries
.
This
was
what
a
*NL*
king
's
palace
,
a
Louvre
,
a
Hotel
de
Saint-Pol
was
then
.
A
city
within
a
*NL*
city
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
tower
where
we
are
placed
,
the
Hotel
Saint-Pol
,
almost
half
*NL*
hidden
by
the
four
great
houses
of
which
we
have
just
spoken
,
was
*NL*
still
very
considerable
and
very
marvellous
to
see
.
One
could
there
*NL*
distinguish
,
very
well
,
though
cleverly
united
with
the
principal
*NL*
building
by
long
galleries
,
decked
with
painted
glass
and
slender
*NL*
columns
,
the
three
Hotels
which
Charles
V.
had
amalgamated
with
his
*NL*
palace
:
the
Hotel
du
Petit-Muce
,
with
the
airy
balustrade
,
which
formed
*NL*
a
graceful
border
to
its
roof
;
the
Hotel
of
the
Abbe
de
Saint-Maur
,
*NL*
having
the
vanity
of
a
stronghold
,
a
great
tower
,
machicolations
,
*NL*
loopholes
,
iron
gratings
,
and
over
the
large
Saxon
door
,
the
armorial
*NL*
bearings
of
the
abbe
,
between
the
two
mortises
of
the
drawbridge
;
the
*NL*
Hotel
of
the
Comte
d'
Etampes
,
whose
donjon
keep
,
ruined
at
its
summit
,
*NL*
was
rounded
and
notched
like
a
cock
's
comb
;
here
and
there
,
three
or
*NL*
four
ancient
oaks
,
forming
a
tuft
together
like
enormous
cauliflowers
;
*NL*
gambols
of
swans
,
in
the
clear
water
of
the
fishponds
,
all
in
folds
of
*NL*
light
and
shade
;
many
courtyards
of
which
one
beheld
picturesque
bits
;
*NL*
the
Hotel
of
the
Lions
,
with
its
low
,
pointed
arches
on
short
,
Saxon
*NL*
pillars
,
its
iron
gratings
and
its
perpetual
roar
;
shooting
up
above
*NL*
the
whole
,
the
scale-ornamented
spire
of
the
Ave-Maria
;
on
the
left
,
the
*NL*
house
of
the
Provost
of
Paris
,
flanked
by
four
small
towers
,
delicately
*NL*
grooved
,
in
the
middle
;
at
the
extremity
,
the
Hotel
Saint-Pol
,
properly
*NL*
speaking
,
with
its
multiplied
facades
,
its
successive
enrichments
from
*NL*
the
time
of
Charles
V.
,
the
hybrid
excrescences
,
with
which
the
fancy
of
*NL*
the
architects
had
loaded
it
during
the
last
two
centuries
,
with
all
*NL*
the
apses
of
its
chapels
,
all
the
gables
of
its
galleries
,
a
thousand
*NL*
weathercocks
for
the
four
winds
,
and
its
two
lofty
contiguous
towers
,
*NL*
whose
conical
roof
,
surrounded
by
battlements
at
its
base
,
looked
like
*NL*
those
pointed
caps
which
have
their
edges
turned
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
Continuing
to
mount
the
stories
of
this
amphitheatre
of
palaces
spread
*NL*
out
afar
upon
the
ground
,
after
crossing
a
deep
ravine
hollowed
out
*NL*
of
the
roofs
in
the
Town
,
which
marked
the
passage
of
the
Rue
*NL*
Saint-Antoine
,
the
eye
reached
the
house
of
Angouleme
,
a
vast
*NL*
construction
of
many
epochs
,
where
there
were
perfectly
new
and
very
*NL*
white
parts
,
which
melted
no
better
into
the
whole
than
a
red
patch
on
a
*NL*
blue
doublet
.
Nevertheless
,
the
remarkably
pointed
and
lofty
roof
of
the
*NL*
modern
palace
,
bristling
with
carved
eaves
,
covered
with
sheets
of
lead
,
*NL*
where
coiled
a
thousand
fantastic
arabesques
of
sparkling
incrustations
*NL*
of
gilded
bronze
,
that
roof
,
so
curiously
damascened
,
darted
upwards
*NL*
gracefully
from
the
midst
of
the
brown
ruins
of
the
ancient
edifice
;
*NL*
whose
huge
and
ancient
towers
,
rounded
by
age
like
casks
,
sinking
*NL*
together
with
old
age
,
and
rending
themselves
from
top
to
bottom
,
*NL*
resembled
great
bellies
unbuttoned
.
Behind
rose
the
forest
of
spires
of
*NL*
the
Palais
des
Tournelles
.
Not
a
view
in
the
world
,
either
at
Chambord
*NL*
or
at
the
Alhambra
,
is
more
magic
,
more
aerial
,
more
enchanting
,
than
*NL*
that
thicket
of
spires
,
tiny
bell
towers
,
chimneys
,
weather-vanes
,
*NL*
winding
staircases
,
lanterns
through
which
the
daylight
makes
its
way
,
*NL*
which
seem
cut
out
at
a
blow
,
pavilions
,
spindle-shaped
turrets
,
or
,
as
*NL*
they
were
then
called
,
``
tournelles
,
''
all
differing
in
form
,
in
height
,
*NL*
and
attitude
.
One
would
have
pronounced
it
a
gigantic
stone
chess-board
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
the
right
of
the
Tournelles
,
that
truss
of
enormous
towers
,
black
as
*NL*
ink
,
running
into
each
other
and
tied
,
as
it
were
,
by
a
circular
moat
;
*NL*
that
donjon
keep
,
much
more
pierced
with
loopholes
than
with
windows
;
*NL*
that
drawbridge
,
always
raised
;
that
portcullis
,
always
lowered
,
--
is
*NL*
the
Bastille
.
Those
sorts
of
black
beaks
which
project
from
between
the
*NL*
battlements
,
and
which
you
take
from
a
distance
to
be
cave
spouts
,
are
*NL*
cannons
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beneath
them
,
at
the
foot
of
the
formidable
edifice
,
behold
the
Porte
*NL*
Sainte-Antoine
,
buried
between
its
two
towers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beyond
the
Tournelles
,
as
far
as
the
wall
of
Charles
V.
,
spread
out
,
*NL*
with
rich
compartments
of
verdure
and
of
flowers
,
a
velvet
carpet
of
*NL*
cultivated
land
and
royal
parks
,
in
the
midst
of
which
one
recognized
,
*NL*
by
its
labyrinth
of
trees
and
alleys
,
the
famous
Daedalus
garden
which
*NL*
Louis
XI
.
had
given
to
Coictier
.
The
doctor
's
observatory
rose
above
the
*NL*
labyrinth
like
a
great
isolated
column
,
with
a
tiny
house
for
a
capital
.
*NL*
Terrible
astrologies
took
place
in
that
laboratory
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
to-day
is
the
Place
Royale
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
have
just
said
,
the
quarter
of
the
palace
,
of
which
we
have
just
*NL*
endeavored
to
give
the
reader
some
idea
by
indicating
only
the
chief
*NL*
points
,
filled
the
angle
which
Charles
V.
's
wall
made
with
the
Seine
on
*NL*
the
east
.
The
centre
of
the
Town
was
occupied
by
a
pile
of
houses
for
*NL*
the
populace
.
It
was
there
,
in
fact
,
that
the
three
bridges
disgorged
*NL*
upon
the
right
bank
,
and
bridges
lead
to
the
building
of
houses
rather
*NL*
than
palaces
.
That
congregation
of
bourgeois
habitations
,
pressed
*NL*
together
like
the
cells
in
a
hive
,
had
a
beauty
of
its
own
.
It
is
with
*NL*
the
roofs
of
a
capital
as
with
the
waves
of
the
sea
,
--
they
are
grand
.
*NL*
First
the
streets
,
crossed
and
entangled
,
forming
a
hundred
amusing
*NL*
figures
in
the
block
;
around
the
market-place
,
it
was
like
a
star
with
a
*NL*
thousand
rays
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Rues
Saint-Denis
and
Saint-Martin
,
with
their
innumerable
*NL*
ramifications
,
rose
one
after
the
other
,
like
trees
intertwining
their
*NL*
branches
;
and
then
the
tortuous
lines
,
the
Rues
de
la
Platrerie
,
de
la
*NL*
Verrerie
,
de
la
Tixeranderie
,
etc.
,
meandered
over
all
.
There
were
also
*NL*
fine
edifices
which
pierced
the
petrified
undulations
of
that
sea
of
*NL*
gables
.
At
the
head
of
the
Pont
aux
Changeurs
,
behind
which
one
beheld
*NL*
the
Seine
foaming
beneath
the
wheels
of
the
Pont
aux
Meuniers
,
there
was
*NL*
the
Chalelet
,
no
longer
a
Roman
tower
,
as
under
Julian
the
Apostate
,
but
*NL*
a
feudal
tower
of
the
thirteenth
century
,
and
of
a
stone
so
hard
that
*NL*
the
pickaxe
could
not
break
away
so
much
as
the
thickness
of
the
fist
*NL*
in
a
space
of
three
hours
;
there
was
the
rich
square
bell
tower
of
*NL*
Saint-Jacques
de
la
Boucherie
,
with
its
angles
all
frothing
with
*NL*
carvings
,
already
admirable
,
although
it
was
not
finished
in
the
*NL*
fifteenth
century
.
-LRB-
It
lacked
,
in
particular
,
the
four
monsters
,
which
,
*NL*
still
perched
to-day
on
the
corners
of
its
roof
,
have
the
air
of
so
*NL*
many
sphinxes
who
are
propounding
to
new
Paris
the
riddle
of
the
ancient
*NL*
Paris
.
Rault
,
the
sculptor
,
only
placed
them
in
position
in
1526
,
and
*NL*
received
twenty
francs
for
his
pains
.
-RRB-
There
was
the
Maison-aux-Piliers
,
*NL*
the
Pillar
House
,
opening
upon
that
Place
de
Greve
of
which
we
have
*NL*
given
the
reader
some
idea
;
there
was
Saint-Gervais
,
which
a
front
``
in
*NL*
good
taste
''
has
since
spoiled
;
Saint-Mery
,
whose
ancient
pointed
arches
*NL*
were
still
almost
round
arches
;
Saint-Jean
,
whose
magnificent
spire
was
*NL*
proverbial
;
there
were
twenty
other
monuments
,
which
did
not
disdain
to
*NL*
bury
their
wonders
in
that
chaos
of
black
,
deep
,
narrow
streets
.
Add
*NL*
the
crosses
of
carved
stone
,
more
lavishly
scattered
through
the
*NL*
squares
than
even
the
gibbets
;
the
cemetery
of
the
Innocents
,
whose
*NL*
architectural
wall
could
be
seen
in
the
distance
above
the
roofs
;
the
*NL*
pillory
of
the
Markets
,
whose
top
was
visible
between
two
chimneys
of
*NL*
the
Rue
de
la
Cossonnerie
;
the
ladder
of
the
Croix-du-Trahoir
,
in
its
*NL*
square
always
black
with
people
;
the
circular
buildings
of
the
wheat
*NL*
mart
;
the
fragments
of
Philip
Augustus
's
ancient
wall
,
which
could
be
*NL*
made
out
here
and
there
,
drowned
among
the
houses
,
its
towers
gnawed
by
*NL*
ivy
,
its
gates
in
ruins
,
with
crumbling
and
deformed
stretches
of
wall
;
*NL*
the
quay
with
its
thousand
shops
,
and
its
bloody
knacker
's
yards
;
the
*NL*
Seine
encumbered
with
boats
,
from
the
Port
au
Foin
to
Port-l'Eveque
,
and
*NL*
you
will
have
a
confused
picture
of
what
the
central
trapezium
of
the
*NL*
Town
was
like
in
1482
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
two
quarters
,
one
of
Hotels
,
the
other
of
houses
,
the
third
*NL*
feature
of
aspect
presented
by
the
city
was
a
long
zone
of
abbeys
,
which
*NL*
bordered
it
in
nearly
the
whole
of
its
circumference
,
from
the
rising
to
*NL*
the
setting
sun
,
and
,
behind
the
circle
of
fortifications
which
hemmed
*NL*
in
Paris
,
formed
a
second
interior
enclosure
of
convents
and
chapels
.
*NL*
Thus
,
immediately
adjoining
the
park
des
Tournelles
,
between
the
*NL*
Rue
Saint-Antoine
and
the
Vielle
Rue
du
Temple
,
there
stood
*NL*
Sainte-Catherine
,
with
its
immense
cultivated
lands
,
which
were
*NL*
terminated
only
by
the
wall
of
Paris
.
Between
the
old
and
the
new
Rue
du
*NL*
Temple
,
there
was
the
Temple
,
a
sinister
group
of
towers
,
lofty
,
erect
,
*NL*
and
isolated
in
the
middle
of
a
vast
,
battlemented
enclosure
.
Between
*NL*
the
Rue
Neuve-du-Temple
and
the
Rue
Saint-Martin
,
there
was
the
Abbey
*NL*
of
Saint-Martin
,
in
the
midst
of
its
gardens
,
a
superb
fortified
church
,
*NL*
whose
girdle
of
towers
,
whose
diadem
of
bell
towers
,
yielded
in
*NL*
force
and
splendor
only
to
Saint-Germain
des
Pres.
Between
the
Rue
*NL*
Saint-Martin
and
the
Rue
Saint-Denis
,
spread
the
enclosure
of
the
*NL*
Trinite
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lastly
,
between
the
Rue
Saint-Denis
,
and
the
Rue
Montorgueil
,
stood
the
*NL*
Filles-Dieu
.
On
one
side
,
the
rotting
roofs
and
unpaved
enclosure
of
the
*NL*
Cour
des
Miracles
could
be
descried
.
It
was
the
sole
profane
ring
which
*NL*
was
linked
to
that
devout
chain
of
convents
.
*NL*
*NL*
Finally
,
the
fourth
compartment
,
which
stretched
itself
out
in
the
*NL*
agglomeration
of
the
roofs
on
the
right
bank
,
and
which
occupied
the
*NL*
western
angle
of
the
enclosure
,
and
the
banks
of
the
river
down
stream
,
*NL*
was
a
fresh
cluster
of
palaces
and
Hotels
pressed
close
about
the
base
*NL*
of
the
Louvre
.
The
old
Louvre
of
Philip
Augustus
,
that
immense
edifice
*NL*
whose
great
tower
rallied
about
it
three
and
twenty
chief
towers
,
not
to
*NL*
reckon
the
lesser
towers
,
seemed
from
a
distance
to
be
enshrined
in
the
*NL*
Gothic
roofs
of
the
Hotel
d'Alencon
,
and
the
Petit-Bourbon
.
This
hydra
*NL*
of
towers
,
giant
guardian
of
Paris
,
with
its
four
and
twenty
heads
,
*NL*
always
erect
,
with
its
monstrous
haunches
,
loaded
or
scaled
with
slates
,
*NL*
and
all
streaming
with
metallic
reflections
,
terminated
with
wonderful
*NL*
effect
the
configuration
of
the
Town
towards
the
west
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
an
immense
block
,
which
the
Romans
called
_
iusula
_
,
or
island
,
of
*NL*
bourgeois
houses
,
flanked
on
the
right
and
the
left
by
two
blocks
of
*NL*
palaces
,
crowned
,
the
one
by
the
Louvre
,
the
other
by
the
Tournelles
,
*NL*
bordered
on
the
north
by
a
long
girdle
of
abbeys
and
cultivated
*NL*
enclosures
,
all
amalgamated
and
melted
together
in
one
view
;
upon
these
*NL*
thousands
of
edifices
,
whose
tiled
and
slated
roofs
outlined
upon
each
*NL*
other
so
many
fantastic
chains
,
the
bell
towers
,
tattooed
,
fluted
,
and
*NL*
ornamented
with
twisted
bands
,
of
the
four
and
forty
churches
on
the
*NL*
right
bank
;
myriads
of
cross
streets
;
for
boundary
on
one
side
,
an
*NL*
enclosure
of
lofty
walls
with
square
towers
-LRB-
that
of
the
University
had
*NL*
round
towers
-RRB-
;
on
the
other
,
the
Seine
,
cut
by
bridges
,
and
bearing
*NL*
on
its
bosom
a
multitude
of
boats
;
behold
the
Town
of
Paris
in
the
*NL*
fifteenth
century
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beyond
the
walls
,
several
suburban
villages
pressed
close
about
*NL*
the
gates
,
but
less
numerous
and
more
scattered
than
those
of
the
*NL*
University
.
Behind
the
Bastille
there
were
twenty
hovels
clustered
round
*NL*
the
curious
sculptures
of
the
Croix-Faubin
and
the
flying
buttresses
of
*NL*
the
Abbey
of
Saint-Antoine
des
Champs
;
then
Popincourt
,
lost
amid
wheat
*NL*
fields
;
then
la
Courtille
,
a
merry
village
of
wine-shops
;
the
hamlet
of
*NL*
Saint-Laurent
with
its
church
whose
bell
tower
,
from
afar
,
seemed
to
*NL*
add
itself
to
the
pointed
towers
of
the
Porte
Saint-Martin
;
the
*NL*
Faubourg
Saint-Denis
,
with
the
vast
enclosure
of
Saint-Ladre
;
beyond
*NL*
the
Montmartre
Gate
,
the
Grange-Bateliere
,
encircled
with
white
walls
;
*NL*
behind
it
,
with
its
chalky
slopes
,
Montmartre
,
which
had
then
almost
as
*NL*
many
churches
as
windmills
,
and
which
has
kept
only
the
windmills
,
*NL*
for
society
no
longer
demands
anything
but
bread
for
the
body
.
Lastly
,
*NL*
beyond
the
Louvre
,
the
Faubourg
Saint-Honore
,
already
considerable
*NL*
at
that
time
,
could
be
seen
stretching
away
into
the
fields
,
and
*NL*
Petit-Bretagne
gleaming
green
,
and
the
Marche
aux
Pourceaux
spreading
*NL*
abroad
,
in
whose
centre
swelled
the
horrible
apparatus
used
for
boiling
*NL*
counterfeiters
.
Between
la
Courtille
and
Saint-Laurent
,
your
eye
had
*NL*
already
noticed
,
on
the
summit
of
an
eminence
crouching
amid
desert
*NL*
plains
,
a
sort
of
edifice
which
resembled
from
a
distance
a
ruined
*NL*
colonnade
,
mounted
upon
a
basement
with
its
foundation
laid
bare
.
This
*NL*
was
neither
a
Parthenon
,
nor
a
temple
of
the
Olympian
Jupiter
.
It
was
*NL*
Montfaucon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
if
the
enumeration
of
so
many
edifices
,
summary
as
we
have
*NL*
endeavored
to
make
it
,
has
not
shattered
in
the
reader
's
mind
the
*NL*
general
image
of
old
Paris
,
as
we
have
constructed
it
,
we
will
*NL*
recapitulate
it
in
a
few
words
.
In
the
centre
,
the
island
of
the
City
,
*NL*
resembling
as
to
form
an
enormous
tortoise
,
and
throwing
out
its
bridges
*NL*
with
tiles
for
scales
;
like
legs
from
beneath
its
gray
shell
of
roofs
.
*NL*
On
the
left
,
the
monolithic
trapezium
,
firm
,
dense
,
bristling
,
of
the
*NL*
University
;
on
the
right
,
the
vast
semicircle
of
the
Town
,
much
*NL*
more
intermixed
with
gardens
and
monuments
.
The
three
blocks
,
city
,
*NL*
university
,
and
town
,
marbled
with
innumerable
streets
.
Across
all
,
*NL*
the
Seine
,
``
foster-mother
Seine
,
''
as
says
Father
Du
Breul
,
blocked
with
*NL*
islands
,
bridges
,
and
boats
.
All
about
an
immense
plain
,
patched
with
*NL*
a
thousand
sorts
of
cultivated
plots
,
sown
with
fine
villages
.
On
the
*NL*
left
,
Issy
,
Vanvres
,
Vaugirarde
,
Montrouge
,
Gentilly
,
with
its
round
*NL*
tower
and
its
square
tower
,
etc.
;
on
the
right
,
twenty
others
,
from
*NL*
Conflans
to
Ville-l'Eveque
.
On
the
horizon
,
a
border
of
hills
arranged
*NL*
in
a
circle
like
the
rim
of
the
basin
.
Finally
,
far
away
to
the
east
,
*NL*
Vincennes
,
and
its
seven
quadrangular
towers
to
the
south
,
Bicetre
and
*NL*
its
pointed
turrets
;
to
the
north
,
Saint-Denis
and
its
spire
;
to
the
*NL*
west
,
Saint
Cloud
and
its
donjon
keep
.
Such
was
the
Paris
which
the
*NL*
ravens
,
who
lived
in
1482
,
beheld
from
the
summits
of
the
towers
of
*NL*
Notre-Dame
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
Voltaire
said
of
this
city
,
that
``
before
Louis
XIV.
,
*NL*
it
possessed
but
four
fine
monuments
''
:
the
dome
of
the
Sorbonne
,
the
*NL*
Val-de-Grace
,
the
modern
Louvre
,
and
I
know
not
what
the
fourth
was
--
the
*NL*
Luxembourg
,
perhaps
.
Fortunately
,
Voltaire
was
the
author
of
``
Candide
''
*NL*
in
spite
of
this
,
and
in
spite
of
this
,
he
is
,
among
all
the
men
who
*NL*
have
followed
each
other
in
the
long
series
of
humanity
,
the
one
who
has
*NL*
best
possessed
the
diabolical
laugh
.
Moreover
,
this
proves
that
one
can
*NL*
be
a
fine
genius
,
and
yet
understand
nothing
of
an
art
to
which
one
*NL*
does
not
belong
.
Did
not
Moliere
imagine
that
he
was
doing
Raphael
and
*NL*
Michael-Angelo
a
very
great
honor
,
by
calling
them
``
those
Mignards
of
*NL*
their
age
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
return
to
Paris
and
to
the
fifteenth
century
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
then
merely
a
handsome
city
;
it
was
a
homogeneous
city
,
an
*NL*
architectural
and
historical
product
of
the
Middle
Ages
,
a
chronicle
in
*NL*
stone
.
It
was
a
city
formed
of
two
layers
only
;
the
Romanesque
layer
and
*NL*
the
Gothic
layer
;
for
the
Roman
layer
had
disappeared
long
before
,
with
*NL*
the
exception
of
the
Hot
Baths
of
Julian
,
where
it
still
pierced
*NL*
through
the
thick
crust
of
the
Middle
Ages
.
As
for
the
Celtic
layer
,
no
*NL*
specimens
were
any
longer
to
be
found
,
even
when
sinking
wells
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fifty
years
later
,
when
the
Renaissance
began
to
mingle
with
this
*NL*
unity
which
was
so
severe
and
yet
so
varied
,
the
dazzling
luxury
of
*NL*
its
fantasies
and
systems
,
its
debasements
of
Roman
round
arches
,
Greek
*NL*
columns
,
and
Gothic
bases
,
its
sculpture
which
was
so
tender
and
so
*NL*
ideal
,
its
peculiar
taste
for
arabesques
and
acanthus
leaves
,
its
*NL*
architectural
paganism
,
contemporary
with
Luther
,
Paris
,
was
perhaps
,
*NL*
still
more
beautiful
,
although
less
harmonious
to
the
eye
,
and
to
the
*NL*
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
splendid
moment
lasted
only
for
a
short
time
;
the
Renaissance
*NL*
was
not
impartial
;
it
did
not
content
itself
with
building
,
it
wished
*NL*
to
destroy
;
it
is
true
that
it
required
the
room
.
Thus
Gothic
Paris
was
*NL*
complete
only
for
a
moment
.
Saint-Jacques
de
la
Boucherie
had
barely
*NL*
been
completed
when
the
demolition
of
the
old
Louvre
was
begun
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
that
,
the
great
city
became
more
disfigured
every
day
.
Gothic
*NL*
Paris
,
beneath
which
Roman
Paris
was
effaced
,
was
effaced
in
its
turn
;
*NL*
but
can
any
one
say
what
Paris
has
replaced
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
the
Paris
of
Catherine
de
Medicis
at
the
Tuileries
;
*
--
the
*NL*
Paris
of
Henri
II.
,
at
the
Hotel
de
Ville
,
two
edifices
still
in
fine
*NL*
taste
;
--
the
Paris
of
Henri
IV.
,
at
the
Place
Royale
:
facades
of
brick
*NL*
with
stone
corners
,
and
slated
roofs
,
tri-colored
houses
;
--
the
Paris
of
*NL*
Louis
XIII.
,
at
the
Val-de-Grace
:
a
crushed
and
squat
architecture
,
with
*NL*
vaults
like
basket-handles
,
and
something
indescribably
pot-bellied
in
*NL*
the
column
,
and
thickset
in
the
dome
;
--
the
Paris
of
Louis
XIV.
,
in
*NL*
the
Invalides
:
grand
,
rich
,
gilded
,
cold
;
--
the
Paris
of
Louis
XV.
,
in
*NL*
Saint-Sulpice
:
volutes
,
knots
of
ribbon
,
clouds
,
vermicelli
and
chiccory
*NL*
leaves
,
all
in
stone
;
--
the
Paris
of
Louis
XVI.
,
in
the
Pantheon
:
Saint
*NL*
Peter
of
Rome
,
badly
copied
-LRB-
the
edifice
is
awkwardly
heaped
together
,
*NL*
which
has
not
amended
its
lines
-RRB-
;
--
the
Paris
of
the
Republic
,
in
the
*NL*
School
of
Medicine
:
a
poor
Greek
and
Roman
taste
,
which
resembles
*NL*
the
Coliseum
or
the
Parthenon
as
the
constitution
of
the
year
III.
,
*NL*
resembles
the
laws
of
Minos
,
--
it
is
called
in
architecture
,
``
the
*NL*
Messidor
''
**
taste
;
--
the
Paris
of
Napoleon
in
the
Place
Vendome
:
this
*NL*
one
is
sublime
,
a
column
of
bronze
made
of
cannons
;
--
the
Paris
of
the
*NL*
Restoration
,
at
the
Bourse
:
a
very
white
colonnade

a
very
*NL*
smooth
frieze
;
the
whole
is
square
and

millions

*NL*

We
have
seen
with
sorrow
mingled
with
indignation
,
that
it
*NL*
is
the
intention
to
increase
,
to
recast
,
to
make
over
,
that
is
to
say
,
*NL*
to
destroy
this
admirable
palace
.
The
architects
of
our
day
have
too
*NL*
heavy
a
hand
to
touch
these
delicate
works
of
the
Renaissance
.
We
still
*NL*
cherish
a
hope
that
they
will
not
dare
.
Moreover
,
this
demolition
of
the
*NL*
Tuileries
now
,
would
be
not
only
a
brutal
deed
of
violence
,
which
*NL*
would
make
a
drunken
vandal
blush
--
it
would
be
an
act
of
treason
.
*NL*
The
Tuileries
is
not
simply
a
masterpiece
of
the
art
of
the
sixteenth
*NL*
century
,
it
is
a
page
of
the
history
of
the
nineteenth
.
This
palace
no
*NL*
longer
belongs
to
the
king
,
but
to
the
people
.
Let
us
leave
it
as
it
is
.
*NL*
Our
revolution
has
twice
set
its
seal
upon
its
front
.
On
one
of
its
two
*NL*
facades
,
there
are
the
cannon-balls
of
the
10th
of
August
;
on
the
other
,
*NL*
the
balls
of
the
29th
of
July
.
It
is
sacred

The

month
of

republican

,
from
the

19th
of
June
to
the
18th
of

.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
To
each
of
these
characteristic
monuments
there
is
attached
by
a
*NL*
similarity
of
taste
,
fashion
,
and
attitude
,
a
certain
number
of
*NL*
houses
scattered
about
in
different
quarters
and
which
the
eyes
of
the
*NL*
connoisseur
easily
distinguishes
and
furnishes
with
a
date
.
When
*NL*
one
knows
how
to
look
,
one
finds
the
spirit
of
a
century
,
and
the
*NL*
physiognomy
of
a
king
,
even
in
the
knocker
on
a
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Paris
of
the
present
day
has
then
,
no
general
physiognomy
.
It
is
*NL*
a
collection
of
specimens
of
many
centuries
,
and
the
finest
have
*NL*
disappeared
.
The
capital
grows
only
in
houses
,
and
what
houses
!
At
the
*NL*
rate
at
which
Paris
is
now
proceeding
,
it
will
renew
itself
every
fifty
*NL*
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
the
historical
significance
of
its
architecture
is
being
effaced
*NL*
every
day
.
Monuments
are
becoming
rarer
and
rarer
,
and
one
seems
to
see
*NL*
them
gradually
engulfed
,
by
the
flood
of
houses
.
Our
fathers
had
a
Paris
*NL*
of
stone
;
our
sons
will
have
one
of
plaster
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
far
as
the
modern
monuments
of
new
Paris
are
concerned
,
we
would
*NL*
gladly
be
excused
from
mentioning
them
.
It
is
not
that
we
do
not
admire
*NL*
them
as
they
deserve
.
The
Sainte-Genevieve
of
M.
Soufflot
is
certainly
*NL*
the
finest
Savoy
cake
that
has
ever
been
made
in
stone
.
The
Palace
of
*NL*
the
Legion
of
Honor
is
also
a
very
distinguished
bit
of
pastry
.
The
*NL*
dome
of
the
wheat
market
is
an
English
jockey
cap
,
on
a
grand
scale
.
The
*NL*
towers
of
Saint-Sulpice
are
two
huge
clarinets
,
and
the
form
is
as
good
*NL*
as
any
other
;
the
telegraph
,
contorted
and
grimacing
,
forms
an
*NL*
admirable
accident
upon
their
roofs
.
Saint-Roch
has
a
door
which
,
for
*NL*
magnificence
,
is
comparable
only
to
that
of
Saint-Thomas
d'Aquin
.
It
*NL*
has
,
also
,
a
crucifixion
in
high
relief
,
in
a
cellar
,
with
a
sun
of
*NL*
gilded
wood
.
These
things
are
fairly
marvellous
.
The
lantern
of
the
*NL*
labyrinth
of
the
Jardin
des
Plantes
is
also
very
ingenious
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
the
Palace
of
the
Bourse
,
which
is
Greek
as
to
its
colonnade
,
*NL*
Roman
in
the
round
arches
of
its
doors
and
windows
,
of
the
Renaissance
*NL*
by
virtue
of
its
flattened
vault
,
it
is
indubitably
a
very
correct
and
*NL*
very
pure
monument
;
the
proof
is
that
it
is
crowned
with
an
attic
,
such
*NL*
as
was
never
seen
in
Athens
,
a
beautiful
,
straight
line
,
gracefully
*NL*
broken
here
and
there
by
stovepipes
.
Let
us
add
that
if
it
is
according
*NL*
to
rule
that
the
architecture
of
a
building
should
be
adapted
to
its
*NL*
purpose
in
such
a
manner
that
this
purpose
shall
be
immediately
apparent
*NL*
from
the
mere
aspect
of
the
building
,
one
can
not
be
too
much
amazed
at
a
*NL*
structure
which
might
be
indifferently
--
the
palace
of
a
king
,
a
chamber
*NL*
of
communes
,
a
town-hall
,
a
college
,
a
riding-school
,
an
academy
,
a
*NL*
warehouse
,
a
court-house
,
a
museum
,
a
barracks
,
a
sepulchre
,
a
temple
,
*NL*
or
a
theatre
.
However
,
it
is
an
Exchange
.
An
edifice
ought
to
be
,
*NL*
moreover
,
suitable
to
the
climate
.
This
one
is
evidently
constructed
*NL*
expressly
for
our
cold
and
rainy
skies
.
It
has
a
roof
almost
as
flat
as
*NL*
roofs
in
the
East
,
which
involves
sweeping
the
roof
in
winter
,
when
it
*NL*
snows
;
and
of
course
roofs
are
made
to
be
swept
.
As
for
its
purpose
,
of
*NL*
which
we
just
spoke
,
it
fulfils
it
to
a
marvel
;
it
is
a
bourse
in
France
*NL*
as
it
would
have
been
a
temple
in
Greece
.
It
is
true
that
the
architect
*NL*
was
at
a
good
deal
of
trouble
to
conceal
the
clock
face
,
which
would
*NL*
have
destroyed
the
purity
of
the
fine
lines
of
the
facade
;
but
,
on
the
*NL*
other
hand
,
we
have
that
colonnade
which
circles
round
the
edifice
and
*NL*
under
which
,
on
days
of
high
religious
ceremony
,
the
theories
of
*NL*
the
stock-brokers
and
the
courtiers
of
commerce
can
be
developed
so
*NL*
majestically
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
are
very
superb
structures
.
Let
us
add
a
quantity
of
fine
,
*NL*
amusing
,
and
varied
streets
,
like
the
Rue
de
Rivoli
,
and
I
do
not
*NL*
despair
of
Paris
presenting
to
the
eye
,
when
viewed
from
a
balloon
,
that
*NL*
richness
of
line
,
that
opulence
of
detail
,
that
diversity
of
aspect
,
*NL*
that
grandiose
something
in
the
simple
,
and
unexpected
in
the
beautiful
,
*NL*
which
characterizes
a
checker-board
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
admirable
as
the
Paris
of
to-day
may
seem
to
you
,
reconstruct
*NL*
the
Paris
of
the
fifteenth
century
,
call
it
up
before
you
in
thought
;
*NL*
look
at
the
sky
athwart
that
surprising
forest
of
spires
,
towers
,
and
*NL*
belfries
;
spread
out
in
the
centre
of
the
city
,
tear
away
at
the
point
*NL*
of
the
islands
,
fold
at
the
arches
of
the
bridges
,
the
Seine
,
with
*NL*
its
broad
green
and
yellow
expanses
,
more
variable
than
the
skin
of
a
*NL*
serpent
;
project
clearly
against
an
azure
horizon
the
Gothic
profile
*NL*
of
this
ancient
Paris
.
Make
its
contour
float
in
a
winter
's
mist
which
*NL*
clings
to
its
numerous
chimneys
;
drown
it
in
profound
night
and
watch
*NL*
the
odd
play
of
lights
and
shadows
in
that
sombre
labyrinth
of
edifices
;
*NL*
cast
upon
it
a
ray
of
light
which
shall
vaguely
outline
it
and
cause
to
*NL*
emerge
from
the
fog
the
great
heads
of
the
towers
;
or
take
that
black
*NL*
silhouette
again
,
enliven
with
shadow
the
thousand
acute
angles
of
the
*NL*
spires
and
gables
,
and
make
it
start
out
more
toothed
than
a
shark
's
jaw
*NL*
against
a
copper-colored
western
sky
,
--
and
then
compare
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
if
you
wish
to
receive
of
the
ancient
city
an
impression
with
which
*NL*
the
modern
one
can
no
longer
furnish
you
,
climb
--
on
the
morning
of
some
*NL*
grand
festival
,
beneath
the
rising
sun
of
Easter
or
of
Pentecost
--
climb
*NL*
upon
some
elevated
point
,
whence
you
command
the
entire
capital
;
and
be
*NL*
present
at
the
wakening
of
the
chimes
.
Behold
,
at
a
signal
given
from
*NL*
heaven
,
for
it
is
the
sun
which
gives
it
,
all
those
churches
quiver
*NL*
simultaneously
.
First
come
scattered
strokes
,
running
from
one
church
*NL*
to
another
,
as
when
musicians
give
warning
that
they
are
about
to
begin
.
*NL*
Then
,
all
at
once
,
behold
!
--
for
it
seems
at
times
,
as
though
the
ear
*NL*
also
possessed
a
sight
of
its
own
,
--
behold
,
rising
from
each
bell
*NL*
tower
,
something
like
a
column
of
sound
,
a
cloud
of
harmony
.
First
,
the
*NL*
vibration
of
each
bell
mounts
straight
upwards
,
pure
and
,
so
to
speak
,
*NL*
isolated
from
the
others
,
into
the
splendid
morning
sky
;
then
,
little
*NL*
by
little
,
as
they
swell
they
melt
together
,
mingle
,
are
lost
in
each
*NL*
other
,
and
amalgamate
in
a
magnificent
concert
.
It
is
no
longer
anything
*NL*
but
a
mass
of
sonorous
vibrations
incessantly
sent
forth
from
the
*NL*
numerous
belfries
;
floats
,
undulates
,
bounds
,
whirls
over
the
city
,
*NL*
and
prolongs
far
beyond
the
horizon
the
deafening
circle
of
its
*NL*
oscillations
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
this
sea
of
harmony
is
not
a
chaos
;
great
and
profound
as
*NL*
it
is
,
it
has
not
lost
its
transparency
;
you
behold
the
windings
of
*NL*
each
group
of
notes
which
escapes
from
the
belfries
.
You
can
follow
the
*NL*
dialogue
,
by
turns
grave
and
shrill
,
of
the
treble
and
the
bass
;
you
can
*NL*
see
the
octaves
leap
from
one
tower
to
another
;
you
watch
them
spring
*NL*
forth
,
winged
,
light
,
and
whistling
,
from
the
silver
bell
,
to
fall
,
*NL*
broken
and
limping
from
the
bell
of
wood
;
you
admire
in
their
midst
the
*NL*
rich
gamut
which
incessantly
ascends
and
re-ascends
the
seven
bells
*NL*
of
Saint-Eustache
;
you
see
light
and
rapid
notes
running
across
it
,
*NL*
executing
three
or
four
luminous
zigzags
,
and
vanishing
like
flashes
*NL*
of
lightning
.
Yonder
is
the
Abbey
of
Saint-Martin
,
a
shrill
,
cracked
*NL*
singer
;
here
the
gruff
and
gloomy
voice
of
the
Bastille
;
at
the
other
*NL*
end
,
the
great
tower
of
the
Louvre
,
with
its
bass
.
The
royal
chime
of
*NL*
the
palace
scatters
on
all
sides
,
and
without
relaxation
,
resplendent
*NL*
trills
,
upon
which
fall
,
at
regular
intervals
,
the
heavy
strokes
from
*NL*
the
belfry
of
Notre-Dame
,
which
makes
them
sparkle
like
the
anvil
under
*NL*
the
hammer
.
At
intervals
you
behold
the
passage
of
sounds
of
all
forms
*NL*
which
come
from
the
triple
peal
of
Saint-Germaine
des
Pres.
Then
,
again
,
*NL*
from
time
to
time
,
this
mass
of
sublime
noises
opens
and
gives
passage
*NL*
to
the
beats
of
the
Ave
Maria
,
which
bursts
forth
and
sparkles
like
*NL*
an
aigrette
of
stars
.
Below
,
in
the
very
depths
of
the
concert
,
you
*NL*
confusedly
distinguish
the
interior
chanting
of
the
churches
,
which
*NL*
exhales
through
the
vibrating
pores
of
their
vaulted
roofs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Assuredly
,
this
is
an
opera
which
it
is
worth
the
trouble
of
listening
*NL*
to
.
Ordinarily
,
the
noise
which
escapes
from
Paris
by
day
is
the
city
*NL*
speaking
;
by
night
,
it
is
the
city
breathing
;
in
this
case
,
it
is
the
*NL*
city
singing
.
Lend
an
ear
,
then
,
to
this
concert
of
bell
towers
;
spread
*NL*
over
all
the
murmur
of
half
a
million
men
,
the
eternal
plaint
of
the
*NL*
river
,
the
infinite
breathings
of
the
wind
,
the
grave
and
distant
*NL*
quartette
of
the
four
forests
arranged
upon
the
hills
,
on
the
horizon
,
*NL*
like
immense
stacks
of
organ
pipes
;
extinguish
,
as
in
a
half
shade
,
*NL*
all
that
is
too
hoarse
and
too
shrill
about
the
central
chime
,
and
*NL*
say
whether
you
know
anything
in
the
world
more
rich
and
joyful
,
more
*NL*
golden
,
more
dazzling
,
than
this
tumult
of
bells
and
chimes
;
--
than
*NL*
this
furnace
of
music
,
--
than
these
ten
thousand
brazen
voices
chanting
*NL*
simultaneously
in
the
flutes
of
stone
,
three
hundred
feet
high
,
--
than
*NL*
this
city
which
is
no
longer
anything
but
an
orchestra
,
--
than
this
*NL*
symphony
which
produces
the
noise
of
a
tempest
.

GOOD
SOULS
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Sixteen
years
previous
to
the
epoch
when
this
story
takes
place
,
one
*NL*
fine
morning
,
on
Quasimodo
Sunday
,
a
living
creature
had
been
deposited
,
*NL*
after
mass
,
in
the
church
of
Notre-Dame
,
on
the
wooden
bed
securely
*NL*
fixed
in
the
vestibule
on
the
left
,
opposite
that
great
image
of
Saint
*NL*
Christopher
,
which
the
figure
of
Messire
Antoine
des
Essarts
,
chevalier
,
*NL*
carved
in
stone
,
had
been
gazing
at
on
his
knees
since
1413
,
when
*NL*
they
took
it
into
their
heads
to
overthrow
the
saint
and
the
faithful
*NL*
follower
.
Upon
this
bed
of
wood
it
was
customary
to
expose
foundlings
*NL*
for
public
charity
.
Whoever
cared
to
take
them
did
so
.
In
front
of
the
*NL*
wooden
bed
was
a
copper
basin
for
alms
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sort
of
living
being
which
lay
upon
that
plank
on
the
morning
of
*NL*
Quasimodo
,
in
the
year
of
the
Lord
,
1467
,
appeared
to
excite
to
a
high
*NL*
degree
,
the
curiosity
of
the
numerous
group
which
had
congregated
about
*NL*
the
wooden
bed
.
The
group
was
formed
for
the
most
part
of
the
fair
sex
.
*NL*
Hardly
any
one
was
there
except
old
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
first
row
,
and
among
those
who
were
most
bent
over
the
bed
,
four
*NL*
were
noticeable
,
who
,
from
their
gray
_
cagoule
_
,
a
sort
of
cassock
,
were
*NL*
recognizable
as
attached
to
some
devout
sisterhood
.
I
do
not
see
*NL*
why
history
has
not
transmitted
to
posterity
the
names
of
these
four
*NL*
discreet
and
venerable
damsels
.
They
were
Agnes
la
Herme
,
Jehanne
de
la
*NL*
Tarme

all

dames
of

Chapel
Etienne
Haudry

who
had
quitted
their

house
with
the
permission
of
their
mistress
,
and
in
conformity
with
the
*NL*
statutes
of
Pierre
d'Ailly
,
in
order
to
come
and
hear
the
sermon
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
if
these
good
Haudriettes
were
,
for
the
moment
,
complying
with
*NL*
the
statutes
of
Pierre
d'Ailly
,
they
certainly
violated
with
joy
those
*NL*
of
Michel
de
Brache
,
and
the
Cardinal
of
Pisa
,
which
so
inhumanly
*NL*
enjoined
silence
upon
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
this
,
sister
?
''
said
Agnes
to
Gauchere
,
gazing
at
the
little
*NL*
creature
exposed
,
which
was
screaming
and
writhing
on
the
wooden
bed
,
*NL*
terrified
by
so
many
glances
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
to
become
of
us

''
said
Jehanne
,
``
if
that
is
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
learned
in
the

of

Agnes
,

it
must
*NL*
be
a

'T
is
not
a

Agnes

'T

remarked
Gauchere

*NL*

'T
is
a

Henriette

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
remarked
Agnes
,
``
it
is
the
third
since
the
Sunday
of
the
*NL*

:
for
,
in

we
had
the
miracle
of
the
mocker
of

pilgrims
divinely
punished
by
Notre-Dame
d'Aubervilliers
,
and
that
was
*NL*
the
second
miracle
within
a
month

*NL*
*NL*
``
This
pretended
foundling
is
a
real
monster

resumed
*NL*
Jehanne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
yells
loud
enough
to
deafen
a
chanter

continued
Gauchere

``
Hold
*NL*
your
tongue

you
little
howler

*NL*
*NL*
``
To
think
that
Monsieur

Reims
sent
this
enormity
to
Monsieur
of

Paris

added
la
Gaultiere
,
clasping
her
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
imagine
,
''
said
Agnes
la
Herme
,
``
that
it
is
a
beast
,
an
animal
,
--
the
*NL*
fruit
of
--
a
Jew

something
not
Christian

in
short
,

ought
to
be
thrown
into
the
fire

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
really

Ah

exclaimed
Agnes
;
``
those
poor
nurses
yonder
in
the
*NL*
foundling
asylum

which
forms
the
lower
end
of
the
lane
as
you
go
to
the
*NL*
river
,
just
beside
Monseigneur
the
bishop
!
what
if
this
little
monster
*NL*
were
to
be
carried
to
them
to
suckle
?
I
'd
rather
give
suck
to
a
*NL*
vampire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
innocent
that
poor
la
Herme
is
!
''
resumed
Jehanne
;
``
do
n't
you
see
,
*NL*
sister
,
that
this
little
monster
is
at
least
four
years
old
,
and
that
he
*NL*
would
have
less
appetite
for
your
breast
than
for
a
turnspit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
``
little
monster
''
we
should
find
it
difficult
ourselves
to
describe
*NL*
him
otherwise
,
was
,
in
fact
,
not
a
new-born
child
.
It
was
a
very
angular
*NL*
and
very
lively
little
mass
,
imprisoned
in
its
linen
sack
,
stamped
with
*NL*
the
cipher
of
Messire
Guillaume
Chartier
,
then
bishop
of
Paris
,
with
a
*NL*
head
projecting
.
That
head
was
deformed
enough
;
one
beheld
only
a
forest
*NL*
of
red
hair
,
one
eye
,
a
mouth
,
and
teeth
.
The
eye
wept
,
the
mouth
*NL*
cried
,
and
the
teeth
seemed
to
ask
only
to
be
allowed
to
bite
.
The
whole
*NL*
struggled
in
the
sack
,
to
the
great
consternation
of
the
crowd
,
which
*NL*
increased
and
was
renewed
incessantly
around
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dame
Aloise
de
Gondelaurier
,
a
rich
and
noble
woman
,
who
held
by
the
*NL*
hand
a
pretty
girl
about
five
or
six
years
of
age
,
and
dragged
a
long
*NL*
veil
about
,
suspended
to
the
golden
horn
of
her
headdress
,
halted
as
she
*NL*
passed
the
wooden
bed
,
and
gazed
for
a
moment
at
the
wretched
creature
,
*NL*
while
her
charming
little
daughter
,
Fleur-de-Lys
de
Gondelaurier
,
*NL*
spelled
out
with
her
tiny
,
pretty
finger
,
the
permanent
inscription
*NL*
attached
to
the
wooden
bed
:
``
Foundlings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
,
''
said
the
dame
,
turning
away
in
disgust
,
``
I
thought
that
they
*NL*
only
exposed

*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
her
back
,
throwing
into
the
basin
a
silver
florin
,
which
rang
*NL*
among
the
liards
,
and
made
the
poor
goodwives
of
the
chapel
of
Etienne
*NL*
Haudry
open
their
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
moment
later
,
the
grave
and
learned
Robert
Mistricolle
,
the
king
's
*NL*
protonotary
,
passed
,
with
an
enormous
missal
under
one
arm
and
his
wife
*NL*
on
the
other
-LRB-
Damoiselle
Guillemette
la
Mairesse
-RRB-
,
having
thus
by
his
*NL*
side
his
two
regulators
,
--
spiritual
and
temporal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Foundling
!
''
he
said
,
after
examining
the
object
;
``
found
,
apparently
,
on
*NL*
the
banks
of
the
river
Phlegethon

*NL*
*NL*
``
One

*NL*
*NL*

returned
Master

,
``
it
is
an

another

so
on

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
know
that
?
''
asked
Guillemette
la
Mairesse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I

it
pertinently

replied
the
protonotary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur

asked
Gauchere

``
The

Mistricolle

*NL*
``

an
old

among

spectators

``
Perhaps

another
;
``

so
bad
already

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
opinion
is
,

exclaimed
Jehanne
de
la
Tarme
,
``
that
it
would
be
better

for

louts

on
a
*NL*
fagot

*NL*
*NL*
``
A

the
old
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
more
prudent

said
Mistricolle
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
several
minutes
,
a
young
priest
had
been
listening
to
the
reasoning
*NL*
of
the
Haudriettes
and
the
sentences
of
the
notary
.
He
had
a
severe
*NL*
face
,
with
a
large
brow
,
a
profound
glance
.
He
thrust
the
crowd
silently
*NL*
aside
,
scrutinized
the
``
little
magician
,
''
and
stretched
out
his
hand
*NL*
upon
him
.
It
was
high
time
,
for
all
the
devotees
were
already
licking
*NL*
their
chops
over
the
``
fine
,
flaming
fagot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
adopt
this
child
,
''
said
the
priest
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
it
in
his
cassock
and
carried
it
off
.
The
spectators
followed
*NL*
him
with
frightened
glances
.
A
moment
later
,
he
had
disappeared
through
*NL*
the
``
Red
Door
,
''
which
then
led
from
the
church
to
the
cloister
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
first
surprise
was
over
,
Jehanne
de
la
Tarme
bent
down
to
the
*NL*
ear
of
la
Gaultiere
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told

CHAPTER
II
.
CLAUDE
FROLLO
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
,
Claude
Frollo
was
no
common
person
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
belonged
to
one
of
those
middle-class
families
which
were
called
*NL*
indifferently
,
in
the
impertinent
language
of
the
last
century
,
the
high
*NL*
_
bourgeoise
_
or
the
petty
nobility
.
This
family
had
inherited
from
the
*NL*
brothers
Paclet
the
fief
of
Tirechappe
,
which
was
dependent
upon
the
*NL*
Bishop
of
Paris
,
and
whose
twenty-one
houses
had
been
in
the
thirteenth
*NL*
century
the
object
of
so
many
suits
before
the
official
.
As
possessor
of
*NL*
this
fief
,
Claude
Frollo
was
one
of
the
twenty-seven
seigneurs
keeping
*NL*
claim
to
a
manor
in
fee
in
Paris
and
its
suburbs
;
and
for
a
long
time
,
*NL*
his
name
was
to
be
seen
inscribed
in
this
quality
,
between
the
Hotel
*NL*
de
Tancarville
,
belonging
to
Master
Francois
Le
Rez
,
and
the
college
of
*NL*
Tours
,
in
the
records
deposited
at
Saint
Martin
des
Champs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Claude
Frollo
had
been
destined
from
infancy
,
by
his
parents
,
to
the
*NL*
ecclesiastical
profession
.
He
had
been
taught
to
read
in
Latin
;
he
had
*NL*
been
trained
to
keep
his
eyes
on
the
ground
and
to
speak
low
.
While
*NL*
still
a
child
,
his
father
had
cloistered
him
in
the
college
of
Torchi
in
*NL*
the
University
.
There
it
was
that
he
had
grown
up
,
on
the
missal
and
the
*NL*
lexicon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
he
was
a
sad
,
grave
,
serious
child
,
who
studied
ardently
,
and
*NL*
learned
quickly
;
he
never
uttered
a
loud
cry
in
recreation
hour
,
mixed
*NL*
but
little
in
the
bacchanals
of
the
Rue
du
Fouarre
,
did
not
know
what
it
*NL*
was
to
_
dare
alapas
et
capillos
laniare
_
,
and
had
cut
no
figure
in
that
*NL*
revolt
of
1463
,
which
the
annalists
register
gravely
,
under
the
title
*NL*
of
``
The
sixth
trouble
of
the
University
.
''
He
seldom
rallied
the
poor
*NL*
students
of
Montaigu
on
the
_
cappettes
_
from
which
they
derived
their
*NL*
name
,
or
the
bursars
of
the
college
of
Dormans
on
their
shaved
tonsure
,
*NL*
and
their
surtout
parti-colored
of
bluish-green
,
blue
,
and
violet
cloth
,
*NL*
_
azurini
coloris
et
bruni
_
,
as
says
the
charter
of
the
Cardinal
des
*NL*
Quatre-Couronnes
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
other
hand
,
he
was
assiduous
at
the
great
and
the
small
schools
*NL*
of
the
Rue
Saint
Jean
de
Beauvais
.
The
first
pupil
whom
the
Abbe
de
*NL*
Saint
Pierre
de
Val
,
at
the
moment
of
beginning
his
reading
on
*NL*
canon
law
,
always
perceived
,
glued
to
a
pillar
of
the
school
*NL*
Saint-Vendregesile
,
opposite
his
rostrum
,
was
Claude
Frollo
,
armed
with
*NL*
his
horn
ink-bottle
,
biting
his
pen
,
scribbling
on
his
threadbare
knee
,
*NL*
and
,
in
winter
,
blowing
on
his
fingers
.
The
first
auditor
whom
Messire
*NL*
Miles
d'Isliers
,
doctor
in
decretals
,
saw
arrive
every
Monday
morning
,
*NL*
all
breathless
,
at
the
opening
of
the
gates
of
the
school
of
the
*NL*
Chef-Saint-Denis
,
was
Claude
Frollo
.
Thus
,
at
sixteen
years
of
age
,
the
*NL*
young
clerk
might
have
held
his
own
,
in
mystical
theology
,
against
a
*NL*
father
of
the
church
;
in
canonical
theology
,
against
a
father
of
the
*NL*
councils
;
in
scholastic
theology
,
against
a
doctor
of
Sorbonne
.
*NL*
*NL*
Theology
conquered
,
he
had
plunged
into
decretals
.
From
the
``
Master
of
*NL*
Sentences
,
''
he
had
passed
to
the
``
Capitularies
of
Charlemagne
;
''
and
he
*NL*
had
devoured
in
succession
,
in
his
appetite
for
science
,
decretals
upon
*NL*
decretals
,
those
of
Theodore
,
Bishop
of
Hispalus
;
those
of
Bouchard
,
*NL*
Bishop
of
Worms
;
those
of
Yves
,
Bishop
of
Chartres
;
next
the
decretal
*NL*
of
Gratian
,
which
succeeded
the
capitularies
of
Charlemagne
;
then
*NL*
the
collection
of
Gregory
IX.
;
then
the
Epistle
of
_
Superspecula
_
,
of
*NL*
Honorius
III
.
He
rendered
clear
and
familiar
to
himself
that
vast
and
*NL*
tumultuous
period
of
civil
law
and
canon
law
in
conflict
and
at
strife
*NL*
with
each
other
,
in
the
chaos
of
the
Middle
Ages
,
--
a
period
which
Bishop
*NL*
Theodore
opens
in
618
,
and
which
Pope
Gregory
closes
in
1227
.
*NL*
*NL*
Decretals
digested
,
he
flung
himself
upon
medicine
,
on
the
liberal
arts
.
*NL*
He
studied
the
science
of
herbs
,
the
science
of
unguents
;
he
became
an
*NL*
expert
in
fevers
and
in
contusions
,
in
sprains
and
abcesses
.
Jacques
*NL*
d'
Espars
would
have
received
him
as
a
physician
;
Richard
Hellain
,
as
a
*NL*
surgeon
.
He
also
passed
through
all
the
degrees
of
licentiate
,
master
,
*NL*
and
doctor
of
arts
.
He
studied
the
languages
,
Latin
,
Greek
,
Hebrew
,
a
*NL*
triple
sanctuary
then
very
little
frequented
.
His
was
a
veritable
fever
*NL*
for
acquiring
and
hoarding
,
in
the
matter
of
science
.
At
the
age
of
*NL*
eighteen
,
he
had
made
his
way
through
the
four
faculties
;
it
seemed
to
*NL*
the
young
man
that
life
had
but
one
sole
object
:
learning
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
towards
this
epoch
,
that
the
excessive
heat
of
the
summer
of
1466
*NL*
caused
that
grand
outburst
of
the
plague
which
carried
off
more
than
*NL*
forty
thousand
souls
in
the
vicomty
of
Paris
,
and
among
others
,
as
Jean
*NL*
de
Troyes
states
,
``
Master
Arnoul
,
astrologer
to
the
king
,
who
was
a
very
*NL*
fine
man
,
both
wise
and
pleasant
.
''
The
rumor
spread
in
the
University
*NL*
that
the
Rue
Tirechappe
was
especially
devastated
by
the
malady
.
It
was
*NL*
there
that
Claude
's
parents
resided
,
in
the
midst
of
their
fief
.
The
*NL*
young
scholar
rushed
in
great
alarm
to
the
paternal
mansion
.
When
*NL*
he
entered
it
,
he
found
that
both
father
and
mother
had
died
on
the
*NL*
preceding
day
.
A
very
young
brother
of
his
,
who
was
in
swaddling
*NL*
clothes
,
was
still
alive
and
crying
abandoned
in
his
cradle
.
This
was
*NL*
all
that
remained
to
Claude
of
his
family
;
the
young
man
took
the
child
*NL*
under
his
arm
and
went
off
in
a
pensive
mood
.
Up
to
that
moment
,
he
had
*NL*
lived
only
in
science
;
he
now
began
to
live
in
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
catastrophe
was
a
crisis
in
Claude
's
existence
.
Orphaned
,
the
*NL*
eldest
,
head
of
the
family
at
the
age
of
nineteen
,
he
felt
himself
*NL*
rudely
recalled
from
the
reveries
of
school
to
the
realities
of
this
*NL*
world
.
Then
,
moved
with
pity
,
he
was
seized
with
passion
and
devotion
*NL*
towards
that
child
,
his
brother
;
a
sweet
and
strange
thing
was
a
human
*NL*
affection
to
him
,
who
had
hitherto
loved
his
books
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
affection
developed
to
a
singular
point
;
in
a
soul
so
new
,
it
was
*NL*
like
a
first
love
.
Separated
since
infancy
from
his
parents
,
whom
he
had
*NL*
hardly
known
;
cloistered
and
immured
,
as
it
were
,
in
his
books
;
eager
*NL*
above
all
things
to
study
and
to
learn
;
exclusively
attentive
up
to
*NL*
that
time
,
to
his
intelligence
which
broadened
in
science
,
to
his
*NL*
imagination
,
which
expanded
in
letters
,
--
the
poor
scholar
had
not
yet
*NL*
had
time
to
feel
the
place
of
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
young
brother
,
without
mother
or
father
,
this
little
child
which
*NL*
had
fallen
abruptly
from
heaven
into
his
arms
,
made
a
new
man
of
him
.
*NL*
He
perceived
that
there
was
something
else
in
the
world
besides
the
*NL*
speculations
of
the
Sorbonne
,
and
the
verses
of
Homer
;
that
man
needed
*NL*
affections
;
that
life
without
tenderness
and
without
love
was
only
a
set
*NL*
of
dry
,
shrieking
,
and
rending
wheels
.
Only
,
he
imagined
,
for
he
was
at
*NL*
the
age
when
illusions
are
as
yet
replaced
only
by
illusions
,
that
the
*NL*
affections
of
blood
and
family
were
the
sole
ones
necessary
,
and
that
a
*NL*
little
brother
to
love
sufficed
to
fill
an
entire
existence
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
threw
himself
,
therefore
,
into
the
love
for
his
little
Jehan
with
the
*NL*
passion
of
a
character
already
profound
,
ardent
,
concentrated
;
that
poor
*NL*
frail
creature
,
pretty
,
fair-haired
,
rosy
,
and
curly
,
--
that
orphan
with
*NL*
another
orphan
for
his
only
support
,
touched
him
to
the
bottom
of
his
*NL*
heart
;
and
grave
thinker
as
he
was
,
he
set
to
meditating
upon
Jehan
*NL*
with
an
infinite
compassion
.
He
kept
watch
and
ward
over
him
as
over
*NL*
something
very
fragile
,
and
very
worthy
of
care
.
He
was
more
than
a
*NL*
brother
to
the
child
;
he
became
a
mother
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Jehan
had
lost
his
mother
while
he
was
still
at
the
breast
;
*NL*
Claude
gave
him
to
a
nurse
.
Besides
the
fief
of
Tirechappe
,
he
had
*NL*
inherited
from
his
father
the
fief
of
Moulin
,
which
was
a
dependency
of
*NL*
the
square
tower
of
Gentilly
;
it
was
a
mill
on
a
hill
,
near
the
chateau
*NL*
of
Winchestre
-LRB-
Bicetre
-RRB-
.
There
was
a
miller
's
wife
there
who
was
nursing
*NL*
a
fine
child
;
it
was
not
far
from
the
university
,
and
Claude
carried
the
*NL*
little
Jehan
to
her
in
his
own
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
that
time
forth
,
feeling
that
he
had
a
burden
to
bear
,
he
took
life
*NL*
very
seriously
.
The
thought
of
his
little
brother
became
not
only
his
*NL*
recreation
,
but
the
object
of
his
studies
.
He
resolved
to
consecrate
*NL*
himself
entirely
to
a
future
for
which
he
was
responsible
in
the
sight
*NL*
of
God
,
and
never
to
have
any
other
wife
,
any
other
child
than
the
*NL*
happiness
and
fortune
of
his
brother
.
Therefore
,
he
attached
himself
*NL*
more
closely
than
ever
to
the
clerical
profession
.
His
merits
,
his
*NL*
learning
,
his
quality
of
immediate
vassal
of
the
Bishop
of
Paris
,
threw
*NL*
the
doors
of
the
church
wide
open
to
him
.
At
the
age
of
twenty
,
by
*NL*
special
dispensation
of
the
Holy
See
,
he
was
a
priest
,
and
served
as
*NL*
the
youngest
of
the
chaplains
of
Notre-Dame
the
altar
which
is
called
,
*NL*
because
of
the
late
mass
which
is
said
there
,
_
altare
pigrorum
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
,
plunged
more
deeply
than
ever
in
his
dear
books
,
which
he
quitted
*NL*
only
to
run
for
an
hour
to
the
fief
of
Moulin
,
this
mixture
of
learning
*NL*
and
austerity
,
so
rare
at
his
age
,
had
promptly
acquired
for
him
*NL*
the
respect
and
admiration
of
the
monastery
.
From
the
cloister
,
his
*NL*
reputation
as
a
learned
man
had
passed
to
the
people
,
among
whom
it
had
*NL*
changed
a
little
,
a
frequent
occurrence
at
that
time
,
into
reputation
as
*NL*
a
sorcerer
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
at
the
moment
when
he
was
returning
,
on
Quasimodo
day
,
from
*NL*
saying
his
mass
at
the
Altar
of
the
Lazy
,
which
was
by
the
side
of
the
*NL*
door
leading
to
the
nave
on
the
right
,
near
the
image
of
the
Virgin
,
*NL*
that
his
attention
had
been
attracted
by
the
group
of
old
women
*NL*
chattering
around
the
bed
for
foundlings
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
it
was
that
he
approached
the
unhappy
little
creature
,
which
was
so
*NL*
hated
and
so
menaced
.
That
distress
,
that
deformity
,
that
abandonment
,
*NL*
the
thought
of
his
young
brother
,
the
idea
which
suddenly
occurred
to
*NL*
him
,
that
if
he
were
to
die
,
his
dear
little
Jehan
might
also
be
flung
*NL*
miserably
on
the
plank
for
foundlings
,
--
all
this
had
gone
to
his
heart
*NL*
simultaneously
;
a
great
pity
had
moved
in
him
,
and
he
had
carried
off
*NL*
the
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
removed
the
child
from
the
sack
,
he
found
it
greatly
deformed
,
*NL*
in
very
sooth
.
The
poor
little
wretch
had
a
wart
on
his
left
eye
,
his
*NL*
head
placed
directly
on
his
shoulders
,
his
spinal
column
was
crooked
,
*NL*
his
breast
bone
prominent
,
and
his
legs
bowed
;
but
he
appeared
to
*NL*
be
lively
;
and
although
it
was
impossible
to
say
in
what
language
*NL*
he
lisped
,
his
cry
indicated
considerable
force
and
health
.
Claude
's
*NL*
compassion
increased
at
the
sight
of
this
ugliness
;
and
he
made
a
vow
in
*NL*
his
heart
to
rear
the
child
for
the
love
of
his
brother
,
in
order
that
,
*NL*
whatever
might
be
the
future
faults
of
the
little
Jehan
,
he
should
have
*NL*
beside
him
that
charity
done
for
his
sake
.
It
was
a
sort
of
investment
*NL*
of
good
works
,
which
he
was
effecting
in
the
name
of
his
young
brother
;
*NL*
it
was
a
stock
of
good
works
which
he
wished
to
amass
in
advance
for
*NL*
him
,
in
case
the
little
rogue
should
some
day
find
himself
short
of
that
*NL*
coin
,
the
only
sort
which
is
received
at
the
toll-bar
of
paradise
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
baptized
his
adopted
child
,
and
gave
him
the
name
of
Quasimodo
,
*NL*
either
because
he
desired
thereby
to
mark
the
day
,
when
he
had
found
*NL*
him
,
or
because
he
wished
to
designate
by
that
name
to
what
a
degree
the
*NL*
poor
little
creature
was
incomplete
,
and
hardly
sketched
out
.
In
fact
,
*NL*
Quasimodo
,
blind
,
hunchbacked
,
knock-kneed
,
was
only
an
``
almost

IMMANIOR

_
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
in
1482
,
Quasimodo
had
grown
up
.
He
had
become
a
few
years
*NL*
previously
the
bellringer
of
Notre-Dame
,
thanks
to
his
father
by
*NL*
adoption
,
Claude
Frollo
,
--
who
had
become
archdeacon
of
Josas
,
thanks
*NL*
to
his
suzerain
,
Messire
Louis
de
Beaumont
,
--
who
had
become
Bishop
of
*NL*
Paris
,
at
the
death
of
Guillaume
Chartier
in
1472
,
thanks
to
his
patron
,
*NL*
Olivier
Le
Daim
,
barber
to
Louis
XI.
,
king
by
the
grace
of
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
Quasimodo
was
the
ringer
of
the
chimes
of
Notre-Dame
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
course
of
time
there
had
been
formed
a
certain
peculiarly
*NL*
intimate
bond
which
united
the
ringer
to
the
church
.
Separated
forever
*NL*
from
the
world
,
by
the
double
fatality
of
his
unknown
birth
and
his
*NL*
natural
deformity
,
imprisoned
from
his
infancy
in
that
impassable
double
*NL*
circle
,
the
poor
wretch
had
grown
used
to
seeing
nothing
in
this
world
*NL*
beyond
the
religious
walls
which
had
received
him
under
their
shadow
.
*NL*
Notre-Dame
had
been
to
him
successively
,
as
he
grew
up
and
developed
,
*NL*
the
egg
,
the
nest
,
the
house
,
the
country
,
the
universe
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
certainly
a
sort
of
mysterious
and
pre-existing
harmony
*NL*
between
this
creature
and
this
church
.
When
,
still
a
little
fellow
,
he
*NL*
had
dragged
himself
tortuously
and
by
jerks
beneath
the
shadows
of
*NL*
its
vaults
,
he
seemed
,
with
his
human
face
and
his
bestial
limbs
,
the
*NL*
natural
reptile
of
that
humid
and
sombre
pavement
,
upon
which
the
shadow
*NL*
of
the
Romanesque
capitals
cast
so
many
strange
forms
.
*NL*
*NL*
Later
on
,
the
first
time
that
he
caught
hold
,
mechanically
,
of
the
*NL*
ropes
to
the
towers
,
and
hung
suspended
from
them
,
and
set
the
bell
to
*NL*
clanging
,
it
produced
upon
his
adopted
father
,
Claude
,
the
effect
of
a
*NL*
child
whose
tongue
is
unloosed
and
who
begins
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
thus
that
,
little
by
little
,
developing
always
in
sympathy
with
*NL*
the
cathedral
,
living
there
,
sleeping
there
,
hardly
ever
leaving
it
,
*NL*
subject
every
hour
to
the
mysterious
impress
,
he
came
to
resemble
it
,
he
*NL*
incrusted
himself
in
it
,
so
to
speak
,
and
became
an
integral
part
of
it
.
*NL*
His
salient
angles
fitted
into
the
retreating
angles
of
the
cathedral
*NL*
-LRB-
if
we
may
be
allowed
this
figure
of
speech
-RRB-
,
and
he
seemed
not
only
its
*NL*
inhabitant
but
more
than
that
,
its
natural
tenant
.
One
might
almost
*NL*
say
that
he
had
assumed
its
form
,
as
the
snail
takes
on
the
form
of
*NL*
its
shell
.
It
was
his
dwelling
,
his
hole
,
his
envelope
.
There
existed
*NL*
between
him
and
the
old
church
so
profound
an
instinctive
sympathy
,
so
*NL*
many
magnetic
affinities
,
so
many
material
affinities
,
that
he
adhered
*NL*
to
it
somewhat
as
a
tortoise
adheres
to
its
shell
.
The
rough
and
*NL*
wrinkled
cathedral
was
his
shell
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
useless
to
warn
the
reader
not
to
take
literally
all
the
*NL*
similes
which
we
are
obliged
to
employ
here
to
express
the
singular
,
*NL*
symmetrical
,
direct
,
almost
consubstantial
union
of
a
man
and
an
*NL*
edifice
.
It
is
equally
unnecessary
to
state
to
what
a
degree
that
*NL*
whole
cathedral
was
familiar
to
him
,
after
so
long
and
so
intimate
a
*NL*
cohabitation
.
That
dwelling
was
peculiar
to
him
.
It
had
no
depths
to
*NL*
which
Quasimodo
had
not
penetrated
,
no
height
which
he
had
not
scaled
.
*NL*
He
often
climbed
many
stones
up
the
front
,
aided
solely
by
the
uneven
*NL*
points
of
the
carving
.
The
towers
,
on
whose
exterior
surface
he
was
*NL*
frequently
seen
clambering
,
like
a
lizard
gliding
along
a
perpendicular
*NL*
wall
,
those
two
gigantic
twins
,
so
lofty
,
so
menacing
,
so
formidable
,
*NL*
possessed
for
him
neither
vertigo
,
nor
terror
,
nor
shocks
of
amazement
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
see
them
so
gentle
under
his
hand
,
so
easy
to
scale
,
one
would
have
*NL*
said
that
he
had
tamed
them
.
By
dint
of
leaping
,
climbing
,
gambolling
*NL*
amid
the
abysses
of
the
gigantic
cathedral
he
had
become
,
in
some
sort
,
*NL*
a
monkey
and
a
goat
,
like
the
Calabrian
child
who
swims
before
he
walks
,
*NL*
and
plays
with
the
sea
while
still
a
babe
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
it
was
not
his
body
alone
which
seemed
fashioned
after
the
*NL*
Cathedral
,
but
his
mind
also
.
In
what
condition
was
that
mind
?
What
*NL*
bent
had
it
contracted
,
what
form
had
it
assumed
beneath
that
knotted
*NL*
envelope
,
in
that
savage
life
?
This
it
would
be
hard
to
determine
.
*NL*
Quasimodo
had
been
born
one-eyed
,
hunchbacked
,
lame
.
It
was
with
*NL*
great
difficulty
,
and
by
dint
of
great
patience
that
Claude
Frollo
had
*NL*
succeeded
in
teaching
him
to
talk
.
But
a
fatality
was
attached
to
the
*NL*
poor
foundling
.
Bellringer
of
Notre-Dame
at
the
age
of
fourteen
,
a
new
*NL*
infirmity
had
come
to
complete
his
misfortunes
:
the
bells
had
broken
the
*NL*
drums
of
his
ears
;
he
had
become
deaf
.
The
only
gate
which
nature
had
*NL*
left
wide
open
for
him
had
been
abruptly
closed
,
and
forever
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
closing
,
it
had
cut
off
the
only
ray
of
joy
and
of
light
which
still
*NL*
made
its
way
into
the
soul
of
Quasimodo
.
His
soul
fell
into
profound
*NL*
night
.
The
wretched
being
's
misery
became
as
incurable
and
as
complete
*NL*
as
his
deformity
.
Let
us
add
that
his
deafness
rendered
him
to
some
*NL*
extent
dumb
.
For
,
in
order
not
to
make
others
laugh
,
the
very
moment
*NL*
that
he
found
himself
to
be
deaf
,
he
resolved
upon
a
silence
which
he
*NL*
only
broke
when
he
was
alone
.
He
voluntarily
tied
that
tongue
which
*NL*
Claude
Frollo
had
taken
so
much
pains
to
unloose
.
Hence
,
it
came
about
,
*NL*
that
when
necessity
constrained
him
to
speak
,
his
tongue
was
torpid
,
*NL*
awkward
,
and
like
a
door
whose
hinges
have
grown
rusty
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
now
we
were
to
try
to
penetrate
to
the
soul
of
Quasimodo
through
that
*NL*
thick
,
hard
rind
;
if
we
could
sound
the
depths
of
that
badly
constructed
*NL*
organism
;
if
it
were
granted
to
us
to
look
with
a
torch
behind
those
*NL*
non-transparent
organs
to
explore
the
shadowy
interior
of
that
opaque
*NL*
creature
,
to
elucidate
his
obscure
corners
,
his
absurd
no-thoroughfares
,
*NL*
and
suddenly
to
cast
a
vivid
light
upon
the
soul
enchained
at
the
*NL*
extremity
of
that
cave
,
we
should
,
no
doubt
,
find
the
unhappy
Psyche
in
*NL*
some
poor
,
cramped
,
and
ricketty
attitude
,
like
those
prisoners
beneath
*NL*
the
Leads
of
Venice
,
who
grew
old
bent
double
in
a
stone
box
which
was
*NL*
both
too
low
and
too
short
for
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
certain
that
the
mind
becomes
atrophied
in
a
defective
body
.
*NL*
Quasimodo
was
barely
conscious
of
a
soul
cast
in
his
own
image
,
moving
*NL*
blindly
within
him
.
The
impressions
of
objects
underwent
a
considerable
*NL*
refraction
before
reaching
his
mind
.
His
brain
was
a
peculiar
medium
;
*NL*
the
ideas
which
passed
through
it
issued
forth
completely
distorted
.
*NL*
The
reflection
which
resulted
from
this
refraction
was
,
necessarily
,
*NL*
divergent
and
perverted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hence
a
thousand
optical
illusions
,
a
thousand
aberrations
of
judgment
,
*NL*
a
thousand
deviations
,
in
which
his
thought
strayed
,
now
mad
,
now
*NL*
idiotic
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
effect
of
this
fatal
organization
was
to
trouble
the
glance
*NL*
which
he
cast
upon
things
.
He
received
hardly
any
immediate
perception
*NL*
of
them
.
The
external
world
seemed
much
farther
away
to
him
than
it
does
*NL*
to
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
second
effect
of
his
misfortune
was
to
render
him
malicious
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
malicious
,
in
fact
,
because
he
was
savage
;
he
was
savage
because
*NL*
he
was
ugly
.
There
was
logic
in
his
nature
,
as
there
is
in
ours
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
strength
,
so
extraordinarily
developed
,
was
a
cause
of
still
greater
*NL*
malevolence
:
''
_
Malus
puer
robustus
_
,
''
says
Hobbes
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
justice
must
,
however
be
rendered
to
him
.
Malevolence
was
not
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
innate
in
him
.
From
his
very
first
steps
among
men
,
he
had
felt
*NL*
himself
,
later
on
he
had
seen
himself
,
spewed
out
,
blasted
,
rejected
.
*NL*
Human
words
were
,
for
him
,
always
a
raillery
or
a
malediction
.
As
he
*NL*
grew
up
,
he
had
found
nothing
but
hatred
around
him
.
He
had
caught
the
*NL*
general
malevolence
.
He
had
picked
up
the
weapon
with
which
he
had
been
*NL*
wounded
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
all
,
he
turned
his
face
towards
men
only
with
reluctance
;
*NL*
his
cathedral
was
sufficient
for
him
.
It
was
peopled
with
marble
*NL*
figures
,
--
kings
,
saints
,
bishops
,
--
who
at
least
did
not
burst
out
*NL*
laughing
in
his
face
,
and
who
gazed
upon
him
only
with
tranquillity
*NL*
and
kindliness
.
The
other
statues
,
those
of
the
monsters
and
demons
,
*NL*
cherished
no
hatred
for
him
,
Quasimodo
.
He
resembled
them
too
much
for
*NL*
that
.
They
seemed
rather
,
to
be
scoffing
at
other
men
.
The
saints
were
*NL*
his
friends
,
and
blessed
him
;
the
monsters
were
his
friends
and
guarded
*NL*
him
.
So
he
held
long
communion
with
them
.
He
sometimes
passed
whole
*NL*
hours
crouching
before
one
of
these
statues
,
in
solitary
conversation
*NL*
with
it
.
If
any
one
came
,
he
fled
like
a
lover
surprised
in
his
*NL*
serenade
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
cathedral
was
not
only
society
for
him
,
but
the
universe
,
and
*NL*
all
nature
beside
.
He
dreamed
of
no
other
hedgerows
than
the
painted
*NL*
windows
,
always
in
flower
;
no
other
shade
than
that
of
the
foliage
of
*NL*
stone
which
spread
out
,
loaded
with
birds
,
in
the
tufts
of
the
Saxon
*NL*
capitals
;
of
no
other
mountains
than
the
colossal
towers
of
the
church
;
*NL*
of
no
other
ocean
than
Paris
,
roaring
at
their
bases
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
he
loved
above
all
else
in
the
maternal
edifice
,
that
which
aroused
*NL*
his
soul
,
and
made
it
open
its
poor
wings
,
which
it
kept
so
miserably
*NL*
folded
in
its
cavern
,
that
which
sometimes
rendered
him
even
happy
,
was
*NL*
the
bells
.
He
loved
them
,
fondled
them
,
talked
to
them
,
understood
them
.
*NL*
From
the
chime
in
the
spire
,
over
the
intersection
of
the
aisles
and
*NL*
nave
,
to
the
great
bell
of
the
front
,
he
cherished
a
tenderness
for
them
*NL*
all
.
The
central
spire
and
the
two
towers
were
to
him
as
three
great
*NL*
cages
,
whose
birds
,
reared
by
himself
,
sang
for
him
alone
.
Yet
it
was
*NL*
these
very
bells
which
had
made
him
deaf
;
but
mothers
often
love
best
*NL*
that
child
which
has
caused
them
the
most
suffering
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
true
that
their
voice
was
the
only
one
which
he
could
still
*NL*
hear
.
On
this
score
,
the
big
bell
was
his
beloved
.
It
was
she
whom
he
*NL*
preferred
out
of
all
that
family
of
noisy
girls
which
bustled
above
*NL*
him
,
on
festival
days
.
This
bell
was
named
Marie
.
She
was
alone
in
the
*NL*
southern
tower
,
with
her
sister
Jacqueline
,
a
bell
of
lesser
size
,
shut
*NL*
up
in
a
smaller
cage
beside
hers
.
This
Jacqueline
was
so
called
from
the
*NL*
name
of
the
wife
of
Jean
Montagu
,
who
had
given
it
to
the
church
,
which
*NL*
had
not
prevented
his
going
and
figuring
without
his
head
at
Montfaucon
.
*NL*
In
the
second
tower
there
were
six
other
bells
,
and
,
finally
,
six
*NL*
smaller
ones
inhabited
the
belfry
over
the
crossing
,
with
the
wooden
*NL*
bell
,
which
rang
only
between
after
dinner
on
Good
Friday
and
the
*NL*
morning
of
the
day
before
Easter
.
So
Quasimodo
had
fifteen
bells
in
his
*NL*
seraglio
;
but
big
Marie
was
his
favorite
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
idea
can
be
formed
of
his
delight
on
days
when
the
grand
peal
was
*NL*
sounded
.
At
the
moment
when
the
archdeacon
dismissed
him
,
and
said
,
*NL*
``
Go
!
''
he
mounted
the
spiral
staircase
of
the
clock
tower
faster
than
any
*NL*
one
else
could
have
descended
it
.
He
entered
perfectly
breathless
into
*NL*
the
aerial
chamber
of
the
great
bell
;
he
gazed
at
her
a
moment
,
devoutly
*NL*
and
lovingly
;
then
he
gently
addressed
her
and
patted
her
with
his
*NL*
hand
,
like
a
good
horse
,
which
is
about
to
set
out
on
a
long
journey
.
*NL*
He
pitied
her
for
the
trouble
that
she
was
about
to
suffer
.
After
these
*NL*
first
caresses
,
he
shouted
to
his
assistants
,
placed
in
the
lower
story
*NL*
of
the
tower
,
to
begin
.
They
grasped
the
ropes
,
the
wheel
creaked
,
the
*NL*
enormous
capsule
of
metal
started
slowly
into
motion
.
Quasimodo
followed
*NL*
it
with
his
glance
and
trembled
.
The
first
shock
of
the
clapper
and
*NL*
the
brazen
wall
made
the
framework
upon
which
it
was
mounted
quiver
.
*NL*
Quasimodo
vibrated
with
the
bell
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Vah
!
''
he
cried
,
with
a
senseless
burst
of
laughter
.
However
,
the
*NL*
movement
of
the
bass
was
accelerated
,
and
,
in
proportion
as
it
described
*NL*
a
wider
angle
,
Quasimodo
's
eye
opened
also
more
and
more
widely
,
*NL*
phosphoric
and
flaming
.
At
length
the
grand
peal
began
;
the
whole
tower
*NL*
trembled
;
woodwork
,
leads
,
cut
stones
,
all
groaned
at
once
,
from
the
*NL*
piles
of
the
foundation
to
the
trefoils
of
its
summit
.
Then
Quasimodo
*NL*
boiled
and
frothed
;
he
went
and
came
;
he
trembled
from
head
to
foot
with
*NL*
the
tower
.
The
bell
,
furious
,
running
riot
,
presented
to
the
two
*NL*
walls
of
the
tower
alternately
its
brazen
throat
,
whence
escaped
that
*NL*
tempestuous
breath
,
which
is
audible
leagues
away
.
Quasimodo
stationed
*NL*
himself
in
front
of
this
open
throat
;
he
crouched
and
rose
with
the
*NL*
oscillations
of
the
bell
,
breathed
in
this
overwhelming
breath
,
gazed
*NL*
by
turns
at
the
deep
place
,
which
swarmed
with
people
,
two
hundred
feet
*NL*
below
him
,
and
at
that
enormous
,
brazen
tongue
which
came
,
second
after
*NL*
second
,
to
howl
in
his
ear
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
only
speech
which
he
understood
,
the
only
sound
which
broke
*NL*
for
him
the
universal
silence
.
He
swelled
out
in
it
as
a
bird
does
in
*NL*
the
sun
.
All
of
a
sudden
,
the
frenzy
of
the
bell
seized
upon
him
;
his
*NL*
look
became
extraordinary
;
he
lay
in
wait
for
the
great
bell
as
it
*NL*
passed
,
as
a
spider
lies
in
wait
for
a
fly
,
and
flung
himself
abruptly
*NL*
upon
it
,
with
might
and
main
.
Then
,
suspended
above
the
abyss
,
borne
*NL*
to
and
fro
by
the
formidable
swinging
of
the
bell
,
he
seized
the
brazen
*NL*
monster
by
the
ear-laps
,
pressed
it
between
both
knees
,
spurred
it
on
*NL*
with
his
heels
,
and
redoubled
the
fury
of
the
peal
with
the
whole
shock
*NL*
and
weight
of
his
body
.
Meanwhile
,
the
tower
trembled
;
he
shrieked
and
*NL*
gnashed
his
teeth
,
his
red
hair
rose
erect
,
his
breast
heaving
like
a
*NL*
bellows
,
his
eye
flashed
flames
,
the
monstrous
bell
neighed
,
panting
,
*NL*
beneath
him
;
and
then
it
was
no
longer
the
great
bell
of
Notre-Dame
nor
*NL*
Quasimodo
:
it
was
a
dream
,
a
whirlwind
,
a
tempest
,
dizziness
mounted
*NL*
astride
of
noise
;
a
spirit
clinging
to
a
flying
crupper
,
a
strange
*NL*
centaur
,
half
man
,
half
bell
;
a
sort
of
horrible
Astolphus
,
borne
away
*NL*
upon
a
prodigious
hippogriff
of
living
bronze
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
presence
of
this
extraordinary
being
caused
,
as
it
were
,
a
breath
of
*NL*
life
to
circulate
throughout
the
entire
cathedral
.
It
seemed
as
though
*NL*
there
escaped
from
him
,
at
least
according
to
the
growing
superstitions
*NL*
of
the
crowd
,
a
mysterious
emanation
which
animated
all
the
stones
of
*NL*
Notre-Dame
,
and
made
the
deep
bowels
of
the
ancient
church
to
palpitate
.
*NL*
It
sufficed
for
people
to
know
that
he
was
there
,
to
make
them
believe
*NL*
that
they
beheld
the
thousand
statues
of
the
galleries
and
the
fronts
in
*NL*
motion
.
And
the
cathedral
did
indeed
seem
a
docile
and
obedient
creature
*NL*
beneath
his
hand
;
it
waited
on
his
will
to
raise
its
great
voice
;
it
*NL*
was
possessed
and
filled
with
Quasimodo
,
as
with
a
familiar
spirit
.
*NL*
One
would
have
said
that
he
made
the
immense
edifice
breathe
.
He
was
*NL*
everywhere
about
it
;
in
fact
,
he
multiplied
himself
on
all
points
of
the
*NL*
structure
.
Now
one
perceived
with
affright
at
the
very
top
of
one
of
*NL*
the
towers
,
a
fantastic
dwarf
climbing
,
writhing
,
crawling
on
all
*NL*
fours
,
descending
outside
above
the
abyss
,
leaping
from
projection
to
*NL*
projection
,
and
going
to
ransack
the
belly
of
some
sculptured
gorgon
;
it
*NL*
was
Quasimodo
dislodging
the
crows
.
Again
,
in
some
obscure
corner
of
the
*NL*
church
one
came
in
contact
with
a
sort
of
living
chimera
,
crouching
*NL*
and
scowling
;
it
was
Quasimodo
engaged
in
thought
.
Sometimes
one
caught
*NL*
sight
,
upon
a
bell
tower
,
of
an
enormous
head
and
a
bundle
of
disordered
*NL*
limbs
swinging
furiously
at
the
end
of
a
rope
;
it
was
Quasimodo
ringing
*NL*
vespers
or
the
Angelus
.
Often
at
night
a
hideous
form
was
seen
wandering
*NL*
along
the
frail
balustrade
of
carved
lacework
,
which
crowns
the
towers
*NL*
and
borders
the
circumference
of
the
apse
;
again
it
was
the
hunchback
of
*NL*
Notre-Dame
.
Then
,
said
the
women
of
the
neighborhood
,
the
whole
church
*NL*
took
on
something
fantastic
,
supernatural
,
horrible
;
eyes
and
mouths
*NL*
were
opened
,
here
and
there
;
one
heard
the
dogs
,
the
monsters
,
and
the
*NL*
gargoyles
of
stone
,
which
keep
watch
night
and
day
,
with
outstretched
*NL*
neck
and
open
jaws
,
around
the
monstrous
cathedral
,
barking
.
And
,
if
*NL*
it
was
a
Christmas
Eve
,
while
the
great
bell
,
which
seemed
to
emit
the
*NL*
death
rattle
,
summoned
the
faithful
to
the
midnight
mass
,
such
an
air
*NL*
was
spread
over
the
sombre
facade
that
one
would
have
declared
that
*NL*
the
grand
portal
was
devouring
the
throng
,
and
that
the
rose
window
was
*NL*
watching
it
.
And
all
this
came
from
Quasimodo
.
Egypt
would
have
taken
*NL*
him
for
the
god
of
this
temple
;
the
Middle
Ages
believed
him
to
be
its
*NL*
demon
:
he
was
in
fact
its
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
such
an
extent
was
this
disease
that
for
those
who
know
that
*NL*
Quasimodo
has
existed
,
Notre-Dame
is
to-day
deserted
,
inanimate
,
dead
.
*NL*
One
feels
that
something
has
disappeared
from
it
.
That
immense
body
is
*NL*
empty
;
it
is
a
skeleton
;
the
spirit
has
quitted
it
,
one
sees
its
place
*NL*
and
that
is
all
.
It
is
like
a
skull
which
still
has
holes
for
the
eyes
,
*NL*
but
no
longer
sight
.

CHAPTER
IV
.
THE
DOG
AND
HIS
MASTER
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
there
was
one
human
creature
whom
Quasimodo
excepted
from
*NL*
his
malice
and
from
his
hatred
for
others
,
and
whom
he
loved
even
more
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
than
his
cathedral
:
this
was
Claude
Frollo
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
matter
was
simple
;
Claude
Frollo
had
taken
him
in
,
had
adopted
him
,
*NL*
had
nourished
him
,
had
reared
him
.
When
a
little
lad
,
it
was
between
*NL*
Claude
Frollo
's
legs
that
he
was
accustomed
to
seek
refuge
,
when
the
*NL*
dogs
and
the
children
barked
after
him
.
Claude
Frollo
had
taught
him
*NL*
to
talk
,
to
read
,
to
write
.
Claude
Frollo
had
finally
made
him
the
*NL*
bellringer
.
Now
,
to
give
the
big
bell
in
marriage
to
Quasimodo
was
to
*NL*
give
Juliet
to
Romeo
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hence
Quasimodo
's
gratitude
was
profound
,
passionate
,
boundless
;
and
*NL*
although
the
visage
of
his
adopted
father
was
often
clouded
or
severe
,
*NL*
although
his
speech
was
habitually
curt
,
harsh
,
imperious
,
that
*NL*
gratitude
never
wavered
for
a
single
moment
.
The
archdeacon
had
in
*NL*
Quasimodo
the
most
submissive
slave
,
the
most
docile
lackey
,
the
most
*NL*
vigilant
of
dogs
.
When
the
poor
bellringer
became
deaf
,
there
had
*NL*
been
established
between
him
and
Claude
Frollo
,
a
language
of
signs
,
*NL*
mysterious
and
understood
by
themselves
alone
.
In
this
manner
the
*NL*
archdeacon
was
the
sole
human
being
with
whom
Quasimodo
had
preserved
*NL*
communication
.
He
was
in
sympathy
with
but
two
things
in
this
world
:
*NL*
Notre-Dame
and
Claude
Frollo
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
nothing
which
can
be
compared
with
the
empire
of
the
archdeacon
*NL*
over
the
bellringer
;
with
the
attachment
of
the
bellringer
for
the
*NL*
archdeacon
.
A
sign
from
Claude
and
the
idea
of
giving
him
pleasure
would
*NL*
have
sufficed
to
make
Quasimodo
hurl
himself
headlong
from
the
summit
of
*NL*
Notre-Dame
.
It
was
a
remarkable
thing
--
all
that
physical
strength
which
*NL*
had
reached
in
Quasimodo
such
an
extraordinary
development
,
and
which
*NL*
was
placed
by
him
blindly
at
the
disposition
of
another
.
There
was
in
*NL*
it
,
no
doubt
,
filial
devotion
,
domestic
attachment
;
there
was
also
the
*NL*
fascination
of
one
spirit
by
another
spirit
.
It
was
a
poor
,
awkward
,
and
*NL*
clumsy
organization
,
which
stood
with
lowered
head
and
supplicating
eyes
*NL*
before
a
lofty
and
profound
,
a
powerful
and
superior
intellect
.
Lastly
,
*NL*
and
above
all
,
it
was
gratitude
.
Gratitude
so
pushed
to
its
extremest
*NL*
limit
,
that
we
do
not
know
to
what
to
compare
it
.
This
virtue
is
not
one
*NL*
of
those
of
which
the
finest
examples
are
to
be
met
with
among
men
.
We
*NL*
will
say
then
,
that
Quasimodo
loved
the
archdeacon
as
never
a
dog
,
never
*NL*
a
horse
,
never
an
elephant
loved
his
master
.

MORE
ABOUT
CLAUDE
FROLLO
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
1482
,
Quasimodo
was
about
twenty
years
of
age
;
Claude
Frollo
,
about
*NL*
thirty-six
.
One
had
grown
up
,
the
other
had
grown
old
.
*NL*
*NL*
Claude
Frollo
was
no
longer
the
simple
scholar
of
the
college
of
Torch
,
*NL*
the
tender
protector
of
a
little
child
,
the
young
and
dreamy
philosopher
*NL*
who
knew
many
things
and
was
ignorant
of
many
.
He
was
a
priest
,
austere
,
*NL*
grave
,
morose
;
one
charged
with
souls
;
monsieur
the
archdeacon
of
Josas
,
*NL*
the
bishop
's
second
acolyte
,
having
charge
of
the
two
deaneries
of
*NL*
Montlhery
,
and
Chateaufort
,
and
one
hundred
and
seventy-four
country
*NL*
curacies
.
He
was
an
imposing
and
sombre
personage
,
before
whom
the
choir
*NL*
boys
in
alb
and
in
jacket
trembled
,
as
well
as
the
machicots
*
,
and
the
*NL*
brothers
of
Saint-Augustine
and
the
matutinal
clerks
of
Notre-Dame
,
*NL*
when
he
passed
slowly
beneath
the
lofty
arches
of
the
choir
,
majestic
,
*NL*
thoughtful
,
with
arms
folded
and
his
head
so
bent
upon
his
breast
that
*NL*
all
one
saw
of
his
face
was
his
large
,
bald
brow
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
An
official
of
Notre-Dame
,
lower
than
a
beneficed
clergyman
,
*NL*
higher
than
simple
paid
chanters
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Dom
Claude
Frollo
had
,
however
,
abandoned
neither
science
nor
the
*NL*
education
of
his
young
brother
,
those
two
occupations
of
his
life
.
But
*NL*
as
time
went
on
,
some
bitterness
had
been
mingled
with
these
things
*NL*
which
were
so
sweet
.
In
the
long
run
,
says
Paul
Diacre
,
the
best
lard
*NL*
turns
rancid
.
Little
Jehan
Frollo
,
surnamed
-LRB-
_
du
Moulin
_
-RRB-
``
of
the
Mill
''
*NL*
because
of
the
place
where
he
had
been
reared
,
had
not
grown
up
in
the
*NL*
direction
which
Claude
would
have
liked
to
impose
upon
him
.
The
big
*NL*
brother
counted
upon
a
pious
,
docile
,
learned
,
and
honorable
pupil
.
But
*NL*
the
little
brother
,
like
those
young
trees
which
deceive
the
gardener
's
*NL*
hopes
and
turn
obstinately
to
the
quarter
whence
they
receive
sun
and
*NL*
air
,
the
little
brother
did
not
grow
and
did
not
multiply
,
but
only
*NL*
put
forth
fine
bushy
and
luxuriant
branches
on
the
side
of
laziness
,
*NL*
ignorance
,
and
debauchery
.
He
was
a
regular
devil
,
and
a
very
disorderly
*NL*
one
,
who
made
Dom
Claude
scowl
;
but
very
droll
and
very
subtle
,
which
*NL*
made
the
big
brother
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
Claude
had
confided
him
to
that
same
college
of
Torchi
where
he
had
*NL*
passed
his
early
years
in
study
and
meditation
;
and
it
was
a
grief
to
*NL*
him
that
this
sanctuary
,
formerly
edified
by
the
name
of
Frollo
,
should
*NL*
to-day
be
scandalized
by
it
.
He
sometimes
preached
Jehan
very
long
and
*NL*
severe
sermons
,
which
the
latter
intrepidly
endured
.
After
all
,
the
*NL*
young
scapegrace
had
a
good
heart
,
as
can
be
seen
in
all
comedies
.
*NL*
But
the
sermon
over
,
he
none
the
less
tranquilly
resumed
his
course
of
*NL*
seditions
and
enormities
.
Now
it
was
a
_
bejaune
_
or
yellow
beak
-LRB-
as
they
*NL*
called
the
new
arrivals
at
the
university
-RRB-
,
whom
he
had
been
mauling
by
*NL*
way
of
welcome
;
a
precious
tradition
which
has
been
carefully
preserved
*NL*
to
our
own
day
.
Again
,
he
had
set
in
movement
a
band
of
scholars
,
*NL*
who
had
flung
themselves
upon
a
wine-shop
in
classic
fashion
,
quasi
*NL*
_
classico
excitati
_
,
had
then
beaten
the
tavern-keeper
``
with
offensive
*NL*
cudgels
,
''
and
joyously
pillaged
the
tavern
,
even
to
smashing
in
the
*NL*
hogsheads
of
wine
in
the
cellar
.
And
then
it
was
a
fine
report
in
Latin
,
*NL*
which
the
sub-monitor
of
Torchi
carried
piteously
to
Dom
Claude
with
*NL*
this
dolorous
marginal
comment
,
--
_
Rixa
;
prima
causa
vinum
optimum
*NL*
potatum
_
.
Finally
,
it
was
said
,
a
thing
quite
horrible
in
a
boy
of
*NL*
sixteen
,
that
his
debauchery
often
extended
as
far
as
the
Rue
de
*NL*
Glatigny
.
*NL*
*NL*
Claude
,
saddened
and
discouraged
in
his
human
affections
,
by
all
this
,
*NL*
had
flung
himself
eagerly
into
the
arms
of
learning
,
that
sister
which
,
*NL*
at
least
does
not
laugh
in
your
face
,
and
which
always
pays
you
,
though
*NL*
in
money
that
is
sometimes
a
little
hollow
,
for
the
attention
which
you
*NL*
have
paid
to
her
.
Hence
,
he
became
more
and
more
learned
,
and
,
at
the
*NL*
same
time
,
as
a
natural
consequence
,
more
and
more
rigid
as
a
*NL*
priest
,
more
and
more
sad
as
a
man
.
There
are
for
each
of
us
several
*NL*
parallelisms
between
our
intelligence
,
our
habits
,
and
our
character
,
*NL*
which
develop
without
a
break
,
and
break
only
in
the
great
disturbances
*NL*
of
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Claude
Frollo
had
passed
through
nearly
the
entire
circle
of
human
*NL*
learning
--
positive
,
exterior
,
and
permissible
--
since
his
youth
,
he
*NL*
was
obliged
,
unless
he
came
to
a
halt
,
_
ubi
defuit
orbis
_
,
to
proceed
*NL*
further
and
seek
other
aliments
for
the
insatiable
activity
of
his
*NL*
intelligence
.
The
antique
symbol
of
the
serpent
biting
its
tail
is
,
*NL*
above
all
,
applicable
to
science
.
It
would
appear
that
Claude
Frollo
had
*NL*
experienced
this
.
Many
grave
persons
affirm
that
,
after
having
exhausted
*NL*
the
_
fas
_
of
human
learning
,
he
had
dared
to
penetrate
into
the
_
nefas
_
.
*NL*
He
had
,
they
said
,
tasted
in
succession
all
the
apples
of
the
tree
of
*NL*
knowledge
,
and
,
whether
from
hunger
or
disgust
,
had
ended
by
tasting
*NL*
the
forbidden
fruit
.
He
had
taken
his
place
by
turns
,
as
the
reader
*NL*
has
seen
,
in
the
conferences
of
the
theologians
in
Sorbonne
,
--
in
the
*NL*
assemblies
of
the
doctors
of
art
,
after
the
manner
of
Saint-Hilaire
,
--
in
*NL*
the
disputes
of
the
decretalists
,
after
the
manner
of
Saint-Martin
,
--
in
*NL*
the
congregations
of
physicians
at
the
holy
water
font
of
Notre-Dame
,
*NL*
_
ad
cupam
Nostroe-Dominoe
_
.
All
the
dishes
permitted
and
approved
,
which
*NL*
those
four
great
kitchens
called
the
four
faculties
could
elaborate
and
*NL*
serve
to
the
understanding
,
he
had
devoured
,
and
had
been
satiated
with
*NL*
them
before
his
hunger
was
appeased
.
Then
he
had
penetrated
further
,
*NL*
lower
,
beneath
all
that
finished
,
material
,
limited
knowledge
;
he
had
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
risked
his
soul
,
and
had
seated
himself
in
the
cavern
at
*NL*
that
mysterious
table
of
the
alchemists
,
of
the
astrologers
,
of
the
*NL*
hermetics
,
of
which
Averroes
,
Gillaume
de
Paris
,
and
Nicolas
Flamel
hold
*NL*
the
end
in
the
Middle
Ages
;
and
which
extends
in
the
East
,
by
the
*NL*
light
of
the
seven-branched
candlestick
,
to
Solomon
,
Pythagoras
,
and
*NL*
Zoroaster
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
is
,
at
least
,
what
was
supposed
,
whether
rightly
or
not
.
It
*NL*
is
certain
that
the
archdeacon
often
visited
the
cemetery
of
the
*NL*
Saints-Innocents
,
where
,
it
is
true
,
his
father
and
mother
had
been
*NL*
buried
,
with
other
victims
of
the
plague
of
1466
;
but
that
he
appeared
*NL*
far
less
devout
before
the
cross
of
their
grave
than
before
the
strange
*NL*
figures
with
which
the
tomb
of
Nicolas
Flamel
and
Claude
Pernelle
,
*NL*
erected
just
beside
it
,
was
loaded
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
certain
that
he
had
frequently
been
seen
to
pass
along
the
Rue
des
*NL*
Lombards
,
and
furtively
enter
a
little
house
which
formed
the
corner
*NL*
of
the
Rue
des
Ecrivans
and
the
Rue
Marivault
.
It
was
the
house
which
*NL*
Nicolas
Flamel
had
built
,
where
he
had
died
about
1417
,
and
which
,
*NL*
constantly
deserted
since
that
time
,
had
already
begun
to
fall
in
*NL*
ruins
,
--
so
greatly
had
the
hermetics
and
the
alchemists
of
all
countries
*NL*
wasted
away
the
walls
,
merely
by
carving
their
names
upon
them
.
Some
*NL*
neighbors
even
affirm
that
they
had
once
seen
,
through
an
air-hole
,
*NL*
Archdeacon
Claude
excavating
,
turning
over
,
digging
up
the
earth
in
the
*NL*
two
cellars
,
whose
supports
had
been
daubed
with
numberless
couplets
and
*NL*
hieroglyphics
by
Nicolas
Flamel
himself
.
It
was
supposed
that
Flamel
had
*NL*
buried
the
philosopher
's
stone
in
the
cellar
;
and
the
alchemists
,
for
*NL*
the
space
of
two
centuries
,
from
Magistri
to
Father
Pacifique
,
never
*NL*
ceased
to
worry
the
soil
until
the
house
,
so
cruelly
ransacked
and
*NL*
turned
over
,
ended
by
falling
into
dust
beneath
their
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
,
it
is
certain
that
the
archdeacon
had
been
seized
with
a
singular
*NL*
passion
for
the
symbolical
door
of
Notre-Dame
,
that
page
of
a
conjuring
*NL*
book
written
in
stone
,
by
Bishop
Guillaume
de
Paris
,
who
has
,
no
doubt
,
*NL*
been
damned
for
having
affixed
so
infernal
a
frontispiece
to
the
sacred
*NL*
poem
chanted
by
the
rest
of
the
edifice
.
Archdeacon
Claude
had
the
*NL*
credit
also
of
having
fathomed
the
mystery
of
the
colossus
of
Saint
*NL*
Christopher
,
and
of
that
lofty
,
enigmatical
statue
which
then
stood
at
*NL*
the
entrance
of
the
vestibule
,
and
which
the
people
,
in
derision
,
*NL*
called
``
Monsieur
Legris
.
''
But
,
what
every
one
might
have
noticed
was
the
*NL*
interminable
hours
which
he
often
employed
,
seated
upon
the
parapet
of
*NL*
the
area
in
front
of
the
church
,
in
contemplating
the
sculptures
of
the
*NL*
front
;
examining
now
the
foolish
virgins
with
their
lamps
reversed
,
now
*NL*
the
wise
virgins
with
their
lamps
upright
;
again
,
calculating
the
angle
*NL*
of
vision
of
that
raven
which
belongs
to
the
left
front
,
and
which
is
*NL*
looking
at
a
mysterious
point
inside
the
church
,
where
is
concealed
the
*NL*
philosopher
's
stone
,
if
it
be
not
in
the
cellar
of
Nicolas
Flamel
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
,
let
us
remark
in
passing
,
a
singular
fate
for
the
Church
of
*NL*
Notre-Dame
at
that
epoch
to
be
so
beloved
,
in
two
different
degrees
,
*NL*
and
with
so
much
devotion
,
by
two
beings
so
dissimilar
as
Claude
and
*NL*
Quasimodo
.
Beloved
by
one
,
a
sort
of
instinctive
and
savage
half-man
,
*NL*
for
its
beauty
,
for
its
stature
,
for
the
harmonies
which
emanated
from
*NL*
its
magnificent
ensemble
;
beloved
by
the
other
,
a
learned
and
passionate
*NL*
imagination
,
for
its
myth
,
for
the
sense
which
it
contains
,
for
the
*NL*
symbolism
scattered
beneath
the
sculptures
of
its
front
,
--
like
the
first
*NL*
text
underneath
the
second
in
a
palimpsest
,
--
in
a
word
,
for
the
enigma
*NL*
which
it
is
eternally
propounding
to
the
understanding
.
*NL*
*NL*
Furthermore
,
it
is
certain
that
the
archdeacon
had
established
himself
*NL*
in
that
one
of
the
two
towers
which
looks
upon
the
Greve
,
just
beside
*NL*
the
frame
for
the
bells
,
a
very
secret
little
cell
,
into
which
no
one
,
*NL*
not
even
the
bishop
,
entered
without
his
leave
,
it
was
said
.
This
tiny
*NL*
cell
had
formerly
been
made
almost
at
the
summit
of
the
tower
,
among
the
*NL*
ravens
'
nests
,
by
Bishop
Hugo
de
Besancon
*
who
had
wrought
sorcery
there
*NL*
in
his
day
.
What
that
cell
contained
,
no
one
knew
;
but
from
the
strand
*NL*
of
the
Terrain
,
at
night
,
there
was
often
seen
to
appear
,
disappear
,
*NL*
and
reappear
at
brief
and
regular
intervals
,
at
a
little
dormer
window
*NL*
opening
upon
the
back
of
the
tower
,
a
certain
red
,
intermittent
,
*NL*
singular
light
which
seemed
to
follow
the
panting
breaths
of
a
bellows
,
*NL*
and
to
proceed
from
a
flame
,
rather
than
from
a
light
.
In
the
darkness
,
*NL*
at
that
height
,
it
produced
a
singular
effect
;
and
the
goodwives
said
:
*NL*
``
There
's
the
archdeacon
blowing
!
hell
is
sparkling
up
yonder
!

There
were
no
great
proofs
of
sorcery
in
that
,
after
all
,
but
there
was
*NL*
still
enough
smoke
to
warrant
a
surmise
of
fire
,
and
the
archdeacon
bore
*NL*
a
tolerably
formidable
reputation
.
We
ought
to
mention
however
,
that
the
*NL*
sciences
of
Egypt
,
that
necromancy
and
magic
,
even
the
whitest
,
even
the
*NL*
most
innocent
,
had
no
more
envenomed
enemy
,
no
more
pitiless
denunciator
*NL*
before
the
gentlemen
of
the
officialty
of
Notre-Dame
.
Whether
this
*NL*
was
sincere
horror
,
or
the
game
played
by
the
thief
who
shouts
,
``
stop
*NL*
thief
!
''
at
all
events
,
it
did
not
prevent
the
archdeacon
from
being
*NL*
considered
by
the
learned
heads
of
the
chapter
,
as
a
soul
who
had
*NL*
ventured
into
the
vestibule
of
hell
,
who
was
lost
in
the
caves
of
the
*NL*
cabal
,
groping
amid
the
shadows
of
the
occult
sciences
.
Neither
were
*NL*
the
people
deceived
thereby
;
with
any
one
who
possessed
any
sagacity
,
*NL*
Quasimodo
passed
for
the
demon
;
Claude
Frollo
,
for
the
sorcerer
.
It
*NL*
was
evident
that
the
bellringer
was
to
serve
the
archdeacon
for
a
given
*NL*
time
,
at
the
end
of
which
he
would
carry
away
the
latter
's
soul
,
by
way
*NL*
of
payment
.
Thus
the
archdeacon
,
in
spite
of
the
excessive
austerity
of
*NL*
his
life
,
was
in
bad
odor
among
all
pious
souls
;
and
there
was
no
devout
*NL*
nose
so
inexperienced
that
it
could
not
smell
him
out
to
be
a
magician
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
if
,
as
he
grew
older
,
abysses
had
formed
in
his
science
,
they
had
*NL*
also
formed
in
his
heart
.
That
at
least
,
is
what
one
had
grounds
for
*NL*
believing
on
scrutinizing
that
face
upon
which
the
soul
was
only
seen
*NL*
to
shine
through
a
sombre
cloud
.
Whence
that
large
,
bald
brow
?
that
head
*NL*
forever
bent
?
that
breast
always
heaving
with
sighs
?
What
secret
thought
*NL*
caused
his
mouth
to
smile
with
so
much
bitterness
,
at
the
same
moment
*NL*
that
his
scowling
brows
approached
each
other
like
two
bulls
on
the
*NL*
point
of
fighting
?
Why
was
what
hair
he
had
left
already
gray
?
What
was
*NL*
that
internal
fire
which
sometimes
broke
forth
in
his
glance
,
to
such
a
*NL*
degree
that
his
eye
resembled
a
hole
pierced
in
the
wall
of
a
furnace
?
*NL*
*NL*
These
symptoms
of
a
violent
moral
preoccupation
,
had
acquired
an
*NL*
especially
high
degree
of
intensity
at
the
epoch
when
this
story
takes
*NL*
place
.
More
than
once
a
choir-boy
had
fled
in
terror
at
finding
him
*NL*
alone
in
the
church
,
so
strange
and
dazzling
was
his
look
.
More
than
*NL*
once
,
in
the
choir
,
at
the
hour
of
the
offices
,
his
neighbor
in
the
*NL*
stalls
had
heard
him
mingle
with
the
plain
song
,
_
ad
omnem
tonum
_
,
*NL*
unintelligible
parentheses
.
More
than
once
the
laundress
of
the
Terrain
*NL*
charged
``
with
washing
the
chapter
''
had
observed
,
not
without
affright
,
*NL*
the
marks
of
nails
and
clenched
fingers
on
the
surplice
of
monsieur
the
*NL*
archdeacon
of
Josas
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
he
redoubled
his
severity
,
and
had
never
been
more
exemplary
.
*NL*
By
profession
as
well
as
by
character
,
he
had
always
held
himself
aloof
*NL*
from
women
;
he
seemed
to
hate
them
more
than
ever
.
The
mere
rustling
*NL*
of
a
silken
petticoat
caused
his
hood
to
fall
over
his
eyes
.
Upon
this
*NL*
score
he
was
so
jealous
of
austerity
and
reserve
,
that
when
the
Dame
de
*NL*
Beaujeu
,
the
king
's
daughter
,
came
to
visit
the
cloister
of
Notre-Dame
,
*NL*
in
the
month
of
December
,
1481
,
he
gravely
opposed
her
entrance
,
*NL*
reminding
the
bishop
of
the
statute
of
the
Black
Book
,
dating
from
the
*NL*
vigil
of
Saint-Barthelemy
,
1334
,
which
interdicts
access
to
the
cloister
*NL*
to
``
any
woman
whatever
,
old
or
young
,
mistress
or
maid
.
''
Upon
which
the
*NL*
bishop
had
been
constrained
to
recite
to
him
the
ordinance
of
Legate
*NL*
Odo
,
which
excepts
certain
great
dames
,
_
aliquae
magnates
mulieres
,
*NL*
quae
sine
scandalo
vitari
non
possunt
_
.
And
again
the
archdeacon
had
*NL*
protested
,
objecting
that
the
ordinance
of
the
legate
,
which
dated
back
*NL*
to
1207
,
was
anterior
by
a
hundred
and
twenty-seven
years
to
the
Black
*NL*
Book
,
and
consequently
was
abrogated
in
fact
by
it
.
And
he
had
refused
*NL*
to
appear
before
the
princess
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
also
noticed
that
his
horror
for
Bohemian
women
and
gypsies
had
*NL*
seemed
to
redouble
for
some
time
past
.
He
had
petitioned
the
bishop
for
*NL*
an
edict
which
expressly
forbade
the
Bohemian
women
to
come
and
dance
*NL*
and
beat
their
tambourines
on
the
place
of
the
Parvis
;
and
for
about
the
*NL*
same
length
of
time
,
he
had
been
ransacking
the
mouldy
placards
of
*NL*
the
officialty
,
in
order
to
collect
the
cases
of
sorcerers
and
witches
*NL*
condemned
to
fire
or
the
rope
,
for
complicity
in
crimes
with
rams
,
sows
,
*NL*
or
goats
.

UNPOPULARITY
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
archdeacon
and
the
bellringer
,
as
we
have
already
said
,
were
but
*NL*
little
loved
by
the
populace
great
and
small
,
in
the
vicinity
of
the
*NL*
cathedral
.
When
Claude
and
Quasimodo
went
out
together
,
which
frequently
*NL*
happened
,
and
when
they
were
seen
traversing
in
company
,
the
valet
*NL*
behind
the
master
,
the
cold
,
narrow
,
and
gloomy
streets
of
the
block
of
*NL*
Notre-Dame
,
more
than
one
evil
word
,
more
than
one
ironical
quaver
,
more
*NL*
than
one
insulting
jest
greeted
them
on
their
way
,
unless
Claude
Frollo
,
*NL*
which
was
rarely
the
case
,
walked
with
head
upright
and
raised
,
showing
*NL*
his
severe
and
almost
august
brow
to
the
dumbfounded
jeerers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Both
were
in
their
quarter
like
``
the
poets
''
of
whom
Regnier
speaks
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
sorts
of
persons
run
after
poets
,
*NL*
As
warblers
fly
shrieking
after
owls
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
a
mischievous
child
risked
his
skin
and
bones
for
the
*NL*
ineffable
pleasure
of
driving
a
pin
into
Quasimodo
's
hump
.
Again
,
a
*NL*
young
girl
,
more
bold
and
saucy
than
was
fitting
,
brushed
the
priest
's
*NL*
black
robe
,
singing
in
his
face
the
sardonic
ditty
,
``
niche
,
niche
,
the
*NL*
devil
is
caught
.
''
Sometimes
a
group
of
squalid
old
crones
,
squatting
in
*NL*
a
file
under
the
shadow
of
the
steps
to
a
porch
,
scolded
noisily
as
the
*NL*
archdeacon
and
the
bellringer
passed
,
and
tossed
them
this
encouraging
*NL*
welcome
,
with
a
curse
:
``
Hum
!
there
's
a
fellow
whose
soul
is
made
like
*NL*
the
other
one
's
body
!
''
Or
a
band
of
schoolboys
and
street
urchins
,
*NL*
playing
hop-scotch
,
rose
in
a
body
and
saluted
him
classically
,
with
*NL*
some
cry
in
Latin
:
''
_
Eia
!
eia
!
Claudius
cum
claudo
_
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
insult
generally
passed
unnoticed
both
by
the
priest
and
the
*NL*
bellringer
.
Quasimodo
was
too
deaf
to
hear
all
these
gracious
things
,
*NL*
and
Claude
was
too
dreamy
.

ABBAS

.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Dom
Claude
's
fame
had
spread
far
and
wide
.
It
procured
for
him
,
at
about
*NL*
the
epoch
when
he
refused
to
see
Madame
de
Beaujeu
,
a
visit
which
he
*NL*
long
remembered
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
the
evening
.
He
had
just
retired
,
after
the
office
,
to
*NL*
his
canon
's
cell
in
the
cloister
of
Notre-Dame
.
This
cell
,
with
the
*NL*
exception
,
possibly
,
of
some
glass
phials
,
relegated
to
a
corner
,
and
*NL*
filled
with
a
decidedly
equivocal
powder
,
which
strongly
resembled
*NL*
the
alchemist
's
``
powder
of
projection
,
''
presented
nothing
strange
or
*NL*
mysterious
.
There
were
,
indeed
,
here
and
there
,
some
inscriptions
on
*NL*
the
walls
,
but
they
were
pure
sentences
of
learning
and
piety
,
extracted
*NL*
from
good
authors
.
The
archdeacon
had
just
seated
himself
,
by
the
*NL*
light
of
a
three-jetted
copper
lamp
,
before
a
vast
coffer
crammed
with
*NL*
manuscripts
.
He
had
rested
his
elbow
upon
the
open
volume
of
_
Honorius
*NL*
d'Autun
_
,
_
De
predestinatione
et
libero
arbitrio
_
,
and
he
was
turning
*NL*
over
,
in
deep
meditation
,
the
leaves
of
a
printed
folio
which
he
had
*NL*
just
brought
,
the
sole
product
of
the
press
which
his
cell
contained
.
In
*NL*
the
midst
of
his
revery
there
came
a
knock
at
his
door
.
``
Who
's
there
?
''
*NL*
cried
the
learned
man
,
in
the
gracious
tone
of
a
famished
dog
,
disturbed
*NL*
over
his
bone
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
voice
without
replied
,
``
Your
friend
,
Jacques
Coictier
.
''
He
went
to
*NL*
open
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
,
in
fact
,
the
king
's
physician
;
a
person
about
fifty
years
of
*NL*
age
,
whose
harsh
physiognomy
was
modified
only
by
a
crafty
eye
.
Another
*NL*
man
accompanied
him
.
Both
wore
long
slate-colored
robes
,
furred
with
*NL*
minever
,
girded
and
closed
,
with
caps
of
the
same
stuff
and
hue
.
Their
*NL*
hands
were
concealed
by
their
sleeves
,
their
feet
by
their
robes
,
their
*NL*
eyes
by
their
caps
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
help
me
,
messieurs
!
''
said
the
archdeacon
,
showing
them
in
;
``
I
*NL*
was
not
expecting
distinguished
visitors
at
such
an
hour
.
''
And
while
*NL*
speaking
in
this
courteous
fashion
he
cast
an
uneasy
and
scrutinizing
*NL*
glance
from
the
physician
to
his
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
never
too
late
to
come
and
pay
a
visit
to
so
considerable
*NL*
a
learned
man
as
Dom
Claude
Frollo
de
Tirechappe
,
''
replied
Doctor
*NL*
Coictier
,
whose
Franche-Comte
accent
made
all
his
phrases
drag
along
*NL*
with
the
majesty
of
a
train-robe
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
then
ensued
between
the
physician
and
the
archdeacon
one
of
those
*NL*
congratulatory
prologues
which
,
in
accordance
with
custom
,
at
that
*NL*
epoch
preceded
all
conversations
between
learned
men
,
and
which
did
not
*NL*
prevent
them
from
detesting
each
other
in
the
most
cordial
manner
in
*NL*
the
world
.
However
,
it
is
the
same
nowadays
;
every
wise
man
's
mouth
*NL*
complimenting
another
wise
man
is
a
vase
of
honeyed
gall
.
*NL*
*NL*
Claude
Frollo
's
felicitations
to
Jacques
Coictier
bore
reference
*NL*
principally
to
the
temporal
advantages
which
the
worthy
physician
had
*NL*
found
means
to
extract
,
in
the
course
of
his
much
envied
career
,
from
*NL*
each
malady
of
the
king
,
an
operation
of
alchemy
much
better
and
more
*NL*
certain
than
the
pursuit
of
the
philosopher
's
stone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In

le
Docteur
Coictier

Dom
Claude
addressed
to
Jacques
Coictier
,
there
*NL*
was
that
sardonical
,
biting
,
and
covertly
mocking
accent
,
and
the
sad
*NL*
cruel
smile
of
a
superior
and
unhappy
man
who
toys
for
a
moment
,
by
way
*NL*
of
distraction
,
with
the
dense
prosperity
of
a
vulgar
man
.
The
other
did
*NL*
not
perceive
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
soul
,
''
said
Claude
at
length
,
pressing
his
hand
,
``
I
am
glad
to
*NL*
see
you
and
in
such
good
health

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks

Master
Claude

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
way
,
''
exclaimed
Dom
Claude
,
``
how
is
your
royal
patient
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
payeth
not
sufficiently
his
physician
,
''
replied
the
doctor
,
casting
*NL*
a
side
glance
at
his
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Think
you
so
,
Gossip
Coictier
,
''
said
the
latter
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
words
,
uttered
in
a
tone
of
surprise
and
reproach
,
drew
upon
this
*NL*
unknown
personage
the
attention
of
the
archdeacon
which
,
to
tell
the
*NL*
truth
,
had
not
been
diverted
from
him
a
single
moment
since
the
stranger
*NL*
had
set
foot
across
the
threshold
of
his
cell
.
It
had
even
required
all
*NL*
the
thousand
reasons
which
he
had
for
handling
tenderly
Doctor
Jacques
*NL*
Coictier
,
the
all-powerful
physician
of
King
Louis
XI.
,
to
induce
him
*NL*
to
receive
the
latter
thus
accompanied
.
Hence
,
there
was
nothing
very
*NL*
cordial
in
his
manner
when
Jacques
Coictier
said
to
him
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
way
,
Dom
Claude
,
I
bring
you
a
colleague
who
has
desired
to
see
*NL*
you
on
account
of
your
reputation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
belongs
to
science
?
''
asked
the
archdeacon
,
fixing
his
piercing
*NL*
eye
upon
Coictier
's
companion
.
He
found
beneath
the
brows
of
the
*NL*
stranger
a
glance
no
less
piercing
or
less
distrustful
than
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
,
so
far
as
the
feeble
light
of
the
lamp
permitted
one
to
judge
,
*NL*
an
old
man
about
sixty
years
of
age
and
of
medium
stature
,
who
appeared
*NL*
somewhat
sickly
and
broken
in
health
.
His
profile
,
although
of
a
very
*NL*
ordinary
outline
,
had
something
powerful
and
severe
about
it
;
his
eyes
*NL*
sparkled
beneath
a
very
deep
superciliary
arch
,
like
a
light
in
the
*NL*
depths
of
a
cave
;
and
beneath
his
cap
which
was
well
drawn
down
and
fell
*NL*
upon
his
nose
,
one
recognized
the
broad
expanse
of
a
brow
of
genius
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
it
upon
himself
to
reply
to
the
archdeacon
's
question
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Reverend
master
,
''
he
said
in
a
grave
tone
,
``
your
renown
has
reached
my
*NL*
ears
,
and
I
wish
to
consult
you
.
I
am
but
a
poor
provincial
gentleman
,
*NL*
who
removeth
his
shoes
before
entering
the
dwellings
of
the
learned
.
You
*NL*
must
know
my
name
.
I
am
called
Gossip
Tourangeau

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Strange
name
for
a
gentleman
,
''
said
the
archdeacon
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
he
had
a
feeling
that
he
was
in
the
presence
of
a
strong
*NL*
and
earnest
character
.
The
instinct
of
his
own
lofty
intellect
made
him
*NL*
recognize
an
intellect
no
less
lofty
under
Gossip
Tourangeau
's
furred
*NL*
cap
,
and
as
he
gazed
at
the
solemn
face
,
the
ironical
smile
which
*NL*
Jacques
Coictier
's
presence
called
forth
on
his
gloomy
face
,
gradually
*NL*
disappeared
as
twilight
fades
on
the
horizon
of
night
.
Stern
and
silent
,
*NL*
he
had
resumed
his
seat
in
his
great
armchair
;
his
elbow
rested
as
*NL*
usual
,
on
the
table
,
and
his
brow
on
his
hand
.
After
a
few
moments
*NL*
of
reflection
,
he
motioned
his
visitors
to
be
seated
,
and
,
turning
to
*NL*
Gossip
Tourangeau
he
said
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
come
to
consult
me
,
master
,
and
upon
what
science
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
reverence
,
''
replied
Tourangeau
,
``
I
am
ill

very
ill

You

*NL*
to

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Medicine
!
''
said
the
archdeacon
,
tossing
his
head
.
He
seemed
to
meditate
*NL*
for
a
moment
,
and
then
resumed
:
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
Gossip
Tourangeau
obeyed
,
and
read
this
inscription
engraved
above
his

head
:
``

*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
Doctor
Jacques
Coictier
had
heard
his
companion
's
question
*NL*
with
a
displeasure
which
Dom
Claude
's
response
had
but
redoubled
.
He
*NL*
bent
down
to
the
ear
of
Gossip
Tourangeau
,
and
said
to
him
,
softly
*NL*
enough
not
to
be
heard
by
the
archdeacon
:
``
I
warned
you
that
he
was
mad
.
*NL*
You
insisted
on
seeing
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
very
possible
that

is

he
is

Doctor
Jacques
,
''
*NL*
replied
his
comrade
in
the
same
low
tone
,
and
with
a
bitter
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you
please
,
''
replied
Coictier
dryly
.
Then
,
addressing
the
*NL*
archdeacon
:
``
You
are
clever
at
your
trade

Dom
Claude
,

you
are
no

more
at

than
a
monkey

over

Medicine
*NL*
a

I
suspect
that
the
pharmacopolists
and
the
master
physicians
*NL*
would
insist
upon
stoning
you
if
they
were
here
.
So
you
deny
the
*NL*
influence
of
philtres
upon
the
blood

on

You
deny
*NL*
that
eternal

called

made
expressly
for

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
deny

said
Dom

coldly
,
``
neither

nor
the
invalid

I
*NL*
reject

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
it
is
not
true

resumed
Coictier
hotly
,
``
that
gout
is
an

eruption

caused

application

roasted

*NL*
The

replied
without
perturbation
:

are
certain

I
think
in

*NL*
``

gave

then
he
allowed

gloomy

to

escape

seemed
to
give

up

Jacques

For

intelligent
as
was

had
*NL*
appeared
not

Dom

He

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
the

*NL*
*NL*
And
opening
the
window
of
his
cell
he
pointed
out
with
his
finger
the
*NL*
immense
church
of
Notre-Dame
,
which
,
outlining
against

sky
*NL*
the
black
silhouette
of
its

its

its
monstrous

seemed
an
enormous
two-headed
sphinx
,
seated
in
the

of

the
city

*NL*
*NL*
The
archdeacon
gazed
at
the
gigantic
edifice
for
some
time
in
silence
,
*NL*
then
extending
his

with
a
sigh

towards
the

lay
open

turning

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

replied
Claude
,
who
seemed
absorbed
in
a
profound
*NL*
meditation
,
and
stood
resting
,
his
forefinger
bent
backward
on
the
folio
*NL*
which
had
come
from
the
famous
press
of
Nuremberg
.
Then
he
added
these
*NL*
mysterious
words
:
``

The

of

sounded
at
the
moment
when

was
repeating
to
his

in
low
tones

his
eternal
refrain
,
``

To
which
his

this

replied

``
I

*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
hour
when
no

could
remain
in
the
cloister

The
two
*NL*
visitors
withdrew
.
``

said
Gossip

,
as
he
took
leave
*NL*
of
the

``

*NL*
The
archdeacon
returned
to
his
chamber
dumbfounded
,
comprehending
*NL*
at
last
who
Gossip
Tourangeau
was
,
and
recalling
that
passage
of
the

register
of

of

:

It
is
asserted

frequent

conferences
with

quite
overshadowed

CHAPTER
II
.
THIS
WILL
KILL
THAT
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Our
lady
readers
will
pardon
us
if
we
pause
for
a
moment
to
seek
what
*NL*
could
have
been
the
thought
concealed
beneath
those
enigmatic
words
of
*NL*
the
archdeacon
:
``
This
will
kill
that
.
The
book
will
kill
the
edifice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
our
mind
,
this
thought
had
two
faces
.
In
the
first
place
,
it
was
a
*NL*
priestly
thought
.
It
was
the
affright
of
the
priest
in
the
presence
of
*NL*
a
new
agent
,
the
printing
press
.
It
was
the
terror
and
dazzled
amazement
*NL*
of
the
men
of
the
sanctuary
,
in
the
presence
of
the
luminous
press
of
*NL*
Gutenberg
.
It
was
the
pulpit
and
the
manuscript
taking
the
alarm
at
the
*NL*
printed
word
:
something
similar
to
the
stupor
of
a
sparrow
which
should
*NL*
behold
the
angel
Legion
unfold
his
six
million
wings
.
It
was
the
cry
of
*NL*
the
prophet
who
already
hears
emancipated
humanity
roaring
and
*NL*
swarming
;
who
beholds
in
the
future
,
intelligence
sapping
faith
,
*NL*
opinion
dethroning
belief
,
the
world
shaking
off
Rome
.
It
was
the
*NL*
prognostication
of
the
philosopher
who
sees
human
thought
,
volatilized
*NL*
by
the
press
,
evaporating
from
the
theocratic
recipient
.
It
was
the
*NL*
terror
of
the
soldier
who
examines
the
brazen
battering
ram
,
and
*NL*
says
:
--
``
The
tower
will
crumble
.
''
It
signified
that
one
power
was
about
*NL*
to
succeed
another
power
.
It
meant
,
``
The
press
will
kill
the
church
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
underlying
this
thought
,
the
first
and
most
simple
one
,
no
doubt
,
*NL*
there
was
in
our
opinion
another
,
newer
one
,
a
corollary
of
the
first
,
*NL*
less
easy
to
perceive
and
more
easy
to
contest
,
a
view
as
philosophical
*NL*
and
belonging
no
longer
to
the
priest
alone
but
to
the
savant
and
the
*NL*
artist
.
It
was
a
presentiment
that
human
thought
,
in
changing
its
form
,
*NL*
was
about
to
change
its
mode
of
expression
;
that
the
dominant
idea
of
*NL*
each
generation
would
no
longer
be
written
with
the
same
matter
,
and
in
*NL*
the
same
manner
;
that
the
book
of
stone
,
so
solid
and
so
durable
,
was
*NL*
about
to
make
way
for
the
book
of
paper
,
more
solid
and
still
more
*NL*
durable
.
In
this
connection
the
archdeacon
's
vague
formula
had
a
second
*NL*
sense
.
It
meant
,
``
Printing
will
kill
architecture
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
,
from
the
origin
of
things
down
to
the
fifteenth
century
of
the
*NL*
Christian
era
,
inclusive
,
architecture
is
the
great
book
of
humanity
,
*NL*
the
principal
expression
of
man
in
his
different
stages
of
development
,
*NL*
either
as
a
force
or
as
an
intelligence
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
memory
of
the
first
races
felt
itself
overloaded
,
when
the
mass
*NL*
of
reminiscences
of
the
human
race
became
so
heavy
and
so
confused
that
*NL*
speech
naked
and
flying
,
ran
the
risk
of
losing
them
on
the
way
,
men
*NL*
transcribed
them
on
the
soil
in
a
manner
which
was
at
once
the
most
*NL*
visible
,
most
durable
,
and
most
natural
.
They
sealed
each
tradition
*NL*
beneath
a
monument
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
monuments
were
simple
masses
of
rock
,
``
which
the
iron
had
not
*NL*
touched
,
''
as
Moses
says
.
Architecture
began
like
all
writing
.
It
was
*NL*
first
an
alphabet
.
Men
planted
a
stone
upright
,
it
was
a
letter
,
and
*NL*
each
letter
was
a
hieroglyph
,
and
upon
each
hieroglyph
rested
a
group
of
*NL*
ideas
,
like
the
capital
on
the
column
.
This
is
what
the
earliest
races
*NL*
did
everywhere
,
at
the
same
moment
,
on
the
surface
of
the
entire
world
.
*NL*
We
find
the
``
standing
stones
''
of
the
Celts
in
Asian
Siberia
;
in
the
*NL*
pampas
of
America
.
*NL*
*NL*
Later
on
,
they
made
words
;
they
placed
stone
upon
stone
,
they
coupled
*NL*
those
syllables
of
granite
,
and
attempted
some
combinations
.
The
Celtic
*NL*
dolmen
and
cromlech
,
the
Etruscan
tumulus
,
the
Hebrew
galgal
,
are
words
.
*NL*
Some
,
especially
the
tumulus
,
are
proper
names
.
Sometimes
even
,
when
men
*NL*
had
a
great
deal
of
stone
,
and
a
vast
plain
,
they
wrote
a
phrase
.
The
*NL*
immense
pile
of
Karnac
is
a
complete
sentence
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
they
made
books
.
Traditions
had
brought
forth
symbols
,
beneath
*NL*
which
they
disappeared
like
the
trunk
of
a
tree
beneath
its
foliage
;
*NL*
all
these
symbols
in
which
humanity
placed
faith
continued
to
grow
,
to
*NL*
multiply
,
to
intersect
,
to
become
more
and
more
complicated
;
the
first
*NL*
monuments
no
longer
sufficed
to
contain
them
,
they
were
overflowing
*NL*
in
every
part
;
these
monuments
hardly
expressed
now
the
primitive
*NL*
tradition
,
simple
like
themselves
,
naked
and
prone
upon
the
earth
.
The
*NL*
symbol
felt
the
need
of
expansion
in
the
edifice
.
Then
architecture
was
*NL*
developed
in
proportion
with
human
thought
;
it
became
a
giant
with
*NL*
a
thousand
heads
and
a
thousand
arms
,
and
fixed
all
this
floating
*NL*
symbolism
in
an
eternal
,
visible
,
palpable
form
.
While
Daedalus
,
who
is
*NL*
force
,
measured
;
while
Orpheus
,
who
is
intelligence
,
sang
;
--
the
pillar
,
*NL*
which
is
a
letter
;
the
arcade
,
which
is
a
syllable
;
the
pyramid
,
which
*NL*
is
a
word
,
--
all
set
in
movement
at
once
by
a
law
of
geometry
and
by
a
*NL*
law
of
poetry
,
grouped
themselves
,
combined
,
amalgamated
,
descended
,
*NL*
ascended
,
placed
themselves
side
by
side
on
the
soil
,
ranged
themselves
*NL*
in
stories
in
the
sky
,
until
they
had
written
under
the
dictation
of
*NL*
the
general
idea
of
an
epoch
,
those
marvellous
books
which
were
also
*NL*
marvellous
edifices
:
the
Pagoda
of
Eklinga
,
the
Rhamseion
of
Egypt
,
the
*NL*
Temple
of
Solomon
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
generating
idea
,
the
word
,
was
not
only
at
the
foundation
of
*NL*
all
these
edifices
,
but
also
in
the
form
.
The
temple
of
Solomon
,
for
*NL*
example
,
was
not
alone
the
binding
of
the
holy
book
;
it
was
the
holy
*NL*
book
itself
.
On
each
one
of
its
concentric
walls
,
the
priests
could
read
*NL*
the
word
translated
and
manifested
to
the
eye
,
and
thus
they
followed
*NL*
its
transformations
from
sanctuary
to
sanctuary
,
until
they
seized
it
in
*NL*
its
last
tabernacle
,
under
its
most
concrete
form
,
which
still
belonged
*NL*
to
architecture
:
the
arch
.
Thus
the
word
was
enclosed
in
an
edifice
,
but
*NL*
its
image
was
upon
its
envelope
,
like
the
human
form
on
the
coffin
of
a
*NL*
mummy
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
not
only
the
form
of
edifices
,
but
the
sites
selected
for
them
,
*NL*
revealed
the
thought
which
they
represented
,
according
as
the
symbol
to
*NL*
be
expressed
was
graceful
or
grave
.
Greece
crowned
her
mountains
with
*NL*
a
temple
harmonious
to
the
eye
;
India
disembowelled
hers
,
to
chisel
*NL*
therein
those
monstrous
subterranean
pagodas
,
borne
up
by
gigantic
rows
*NL*
of
granite
elephants
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
,
during
the
first
six
thousand
years
of
the
world
,
from
the
*NL*
most
immemorial
pagoda
of
Hindustan
,
to
the
cathedral
of
Cologne
,
*NL*
architecture
was
the
great
handwriting
of
the
human
race
.
And
this
is
so
*NL*
true
,
that
not
only
every
religious
symbol
,
but
every
human
thought
,
has
*NL*
its
page
and
its
monument
in
that
immense
book
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
civilization
begins
in
theocracy
and
ends
in
democracy
.
This
law
of
*NL*
liberty
following
unity
is
written
in
architecture
.
For
,
let
us
insist
*NL*
upon
this
point
,
masonry
must
not
be
thought
to
be
powerful
only
in
*NL*
erecting
the
temple
and
in
expressing
the
myth
and
sacerdotal
symbolism
;
*NL*
in
inscribing
in
hieroglyphs
upon
its
pages
of
stone
the
mysterious
*NL*
tables
of
the
law
.
If
it
were
thus
,
--
as
there
comes
in
all
human
society
*NL*
a
moment
when
the
sacred
symbol
is
worn
out
and
becomes
obliterated
*NL*
under
freedom
of
thought
,
when
man
escapes
from
the
priest
,
when
*NL*
the
excrescence
of
philosophies
and
systems
devour
the
face
of
*NL*
religion
,
--
architecture
could
not
reproduce
this
new
state
of
human
*NL*
thought
;
its
leaves
,
so
crowded
on
the
face
,
would
be
empty
on
the
back
;
*NL*
its
work
would
be
mutilated
;
its
book
would
be
incomplete
.
But
no
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
take
as
an
example
the
Middle
Ages
,
where
we
see
more
clearly
*NL*
because
it
is
nearer
to
us
.
During
its
first
period
,
while
theocracy
is
*NL*
organizing
Europe
,
while
the
Vatican
is
rallying
and
reclassing
about
*NL*
itself
the
elements
of
a
Rome
made
from
the
Rome
which
lies
in
ruins
*NL*
around
the
Capitol
,
while
Christianity
is
seeking
all
the
stages
of
*NL*
society
amid
the
rubbish
of
anterior
civilization
,
and
rebuilding
with
*NL*
its
ruins
a
new
hierarchic
universe
,
the
keystone
to
whose
vault
is
the
*NL*
priest
--
one
first
hears
a
dull
echo
from
that
chaos
,
and
then
,
little
by
*NL*
little
,
one
sees
,
arising
from
beneath
the
breath
of
Christianity
,
from
*NL*
beneath
the
hand
of
the
barbarians
,
from
the
fragments
of
the
dead
Greek
*NL*
and
Roman
architectures
,
that
mysterious
Romanesque
architecture
,
sister
*NL*
of
the
theocratic
masonry
of
Egypt
and
of
India
,
inalterable
emblem
of
*NL*
pure
catholicism
,
unchangeable
hieroglyph
of
the
papal
unity
.
All
the
*NL*
thought
of
that
day
is
written
,
in
fact
,
in
this
sombre
,
Romanesque
*NL*
style
.
One
feels
everywhere
in
it
authority
,
unity
,
the
impenetrable
,
*NL*
the
absolute
,
Gregory
VII.
;
always
the
priest
,
never
the
man
;
everywhere
*NL*
caste
,
never
the
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
Crusades
arrive
.
They
are
a
great
popular
movement
,
and
every
*NL*
great
popular
movement
,
whatever
may
be
its
cause
and
object
,
always
*NL*
sets
free
the
spirit
of
liberty
from
its
final
precipitate
.
New
*NL*
things
spring
into
life
every
day
.
Here
opens
the
stormy
period
of
the
*NL*
Jacqueries
,
Pragueries
,
and
Leagues
.
Authority
wavers
,
unity
is
divided
.
*NL*
Feudalism
demands
to
share
with
theocracy
,
while
awaiting
the
inevitable
*NL*
arrival
of
the
people
,
who
will
assume
the
part
of
the
lion
:
_
Quia
*NL*
nominor
leo
_
.
Seignory
pierces
through
sacerdotalism
;
the
commonality
,
*NL*
through
seignory
.
The
face
of
Europe
is
changed
.
Well
!
the
face
of
*NL*
architecture
is
changed
also
.
Like
civilization
,
it
has
turned
a
*NL*
page
,
and
the
new
spirit
of
the
time
finds
her
ready
to
write
at
its
*NL*
dictation
.
It
returns
from
the
crusades
with
the
pointed
arch
,
like
the
*NL*
nations
with
liberty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
while
Rome
is
undergoing
gradual
dismemberment
,
Romanesque
*NL*
architecture
dies
.
The
hieroglyph
deserts
the
cathedral
,
and
betakes
*NL*
itself
to
blazoning
the
donjon
keep
,
in
order
to
lend
prestige
to
*NL*
feudalism
.
The
cathedral
itself
,
that
edifice
formerly
so
dogmatic
,
*NL*
invaded
henceforth
by
the
bourgeoisie
,
by
the
community
,
by
liberty
,
*NL*
escapes
the
priest
and
falls
into
the
power
of
the
artist
.
The
artist
*NL*
builds
it
after
his
own
fashion
.
Farewell
to
mystery
,
myth
,
law
.
Fancy
*NL*
and
caprice
,
welcome
.
Provided
the
priest
has
his
basilica
and
his
*NL*
altar
,
he
has
nothing
to
say
.
The
four
walls
belong
to
the
artist
.
The
*NL*
architectural
book
belongs
no
longer
to
the
priest
,
to
religion
,
to
*NL*
Rome
;
it
is
the
property
of
poetry
,
of
imagination
,
of
the
people
.
Hence
*NL*
the
rapid
and
innumerable
transformations
of
that
architecture
which
*NL*
owns
but
three
centuries
,
so
striking
after
the
stagnant
immobility
of
*NL*
the
Romanesque
architecture
,
which
owns
six
or
seven
.
Nevertheless
,
*NL*
art
marches
on
with
giant
strides
.
Popular
genius
amid
originality
*NL*
accomplish
the
task
which
the
bishops
formerly
fulfilled
.
Each
race
*NL*
writes
its
line
upon
the
book
,
as
it
passes
;
it
erases
the
ancient
*NL*
Romanesque
hieroglyphs
on
the
frontispieces
of
cathedrals
,
and
at
the
*NL*
most
one
only
sees
dogma
cropping
out
here
and
there
,
beneath
the
new
*NL*
symbol
which
it
has
deposited
.
The
popular
drapery
hardly
permits
the
*NL*
religious
skeleton
to
be
suspected
.
One
can
not
even
form
an
idea
of
the
*NL*
liberties
which
the
architects
then
take
,
even
toward
the
Church
.
There
*NL*
are
capitals
knitted
of
nuns
and
monks
,
shamelessly
coupled
,
as
on
the
*NL*
hall
of
chimney
pieces
in
the
Palais
de
Justice
,
in
Paris
.
There
is
*NL*
Noah
's
adventure
carved
to
the
last
detail
,
as
under
the
great
portal
*NL*
of
Bourges
.
There
is
a
bacchanalian
monk
,
with
ass
's
ears
and
glass
in
*NL*
hand
,
laughing
in
the
face
of
a
whole
community
,
as
on
the
lavatory
*NL*
of
the
Abbey
of
Bocherville
.
There
exists
at
that
epoch
,
for
thought
*NL*
written
in
stone
,
a
privilege
exactly
comparable
to
our
present
liberty
*NL*
of
the
press
.
It
is
the
liberty
of
architecture
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
liberty
goes
very
far
.
Sometimes
a
portal
,
a
facade
,
an
entire
*NL*
church
,
presents
a
symbolical
sense
absolutely
foreign
to
worship
,
or
*NL*
even
hostile
to
the
Church
.
In
the
thirteenth
century
,
Guillaume
de
*NL*
Paris
,
and
Nicholas
Flamel
,
in
the
fifteenth
,
wrote
such
seditious
*NL*
pages
.
Saint-Jacques
de
la
Boucherie
was
a
whole
church
of
the
*NL*
opposition
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thought
was
then
free
only
in
this
manner
;
hence
it
never
wrote
itself
*NL*
out
completely
except
on
the
books
called
edifices
.
Thought
,
under
the
*NL*
form
of
edifice
,
could
have
beheld
itself
burned
in
the
public
square
*NL*
by
the
hands
of
the
executioner
,
in
its
manuscript
form
,
if
it
had
been
*NL*
sufficiently
imprudent
to
risk
itself
thus
;
thought
,
as
the
door
of
a
*NL*
church
,
would
have
been
a
spectator
of
the
punishment
of
thought
as
a
*NL*
book
.
Having
thus
only
this
resource
,
masonry
,
in
order
to
make
its
way
*NL*
to
the
light
,
flung
itself
upon
it
from
all
quarters
.
Hence
the
immense
*NL*
quantity
of
cathedrals
which
have
covered
Europe
--
a
number
so
prodigious
*NL*
that
one
can
hardly
believe
it
even
after
having
verified
it
.
All
*NL*
the
material
forces
,
all
the
intellectual
forces
of
society
converged
*NL*
towards
the
same
point
:
architecture
.
In
this
manner
,
under
the
pretext
*NL*
of
building
churches
to
God
,
art
was
developed
in
its
magnificent
*NL*
proportions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
whoever
was
born
a
poet
became
an
architect
.
Genius
,
scattered
in
*NL*
the
masses
,
repressed
in
every
quarter
under
feudalism
as
under
a
*NL*
_
testudo
_
of
brazen
bucklers
,
finding
no
issue
except
in
the
direction
*NL*
of
architecture
,
--
gushed
forth
through
that
art
,
and
its
Iliads
assumed
*NL*
the
form
of
cathedrals
.
All
other
arts
obeyed
,
and
placed
themselves
*NL*
under
the
discipline
of
architecture
.
They
were
the
workmen
of
the
great
*NL*
work
.
The
architect
,
the
poet
,
the
master
,
summed
up
in
his
person
the
*NL*
sculpture
which
carved
his
facades
,
painting
which
illuminated
his
*NL*
windows
,
music
which
set
his
bells
to
pealing
,
and
breathed
into
his
*NL*
organs
.
There
was
nothing
down
to
poor
poetry
,
--
properly
speaking
,
that
*NL*
which
persisted
in
vegetating
in
manuscripts
,
--
which
was
not
forced
,
in
*NL*
order
to
make
something
of
itself
,
to
come
and
frame
itself
in
the
*NL*
edifice
in
the
shape
of
a
hymn
or
of
prose
;
the
same
part
,
after
all
,
*NL*
which
the
tragedies
of
AEschylus
had
played
in
the
sacerdotal
festivals
*NL*
of
Greece
;
Genesis
,
in
the
temple
of
Solomon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
,
down
to
the
time
of
Gutenberg
,
architecture
is
the
principal
*NL*
writing
,
the
universal
writing
.
In
that
granite
book
,
begun
by
the
*NL*
Orient
,
continued
by
Greek
and
Roman
antiquity
,
the
Middle
Ages
wrote
*NL*
the
last
page
.
Moreover
,
this
phenomenon
of
an
architecture
of
the
*NL*
people
following
an
architecture
of
caste
,
which
we
have
just
been
*NL*
observing
in
the
Middle
Ages
,
is
reproduced
with
every
analogous
*NL*
movement
in
the
human
intelligence
at
the
other
great
epochs
of
history
.
*NL*
Thus
,
in
order
to
enunciate
here
only
summarily
,
a
law
which
it
would
*NL*
require
volumes
to
develop
:
in
the
high
Orient
,
the
cradle
of
primitive
*NL*
times
,
after
Hindoo
architecture
came
Phoenician
architecture
,
that
*NL*
opulent
mother
of
Arabian
architecture
;
in
antiquity
,
after
Egyptian
*NL*
architecture
,
of
which
Etruscan
style
and
cyclopean
monuments
are
but
*NL*
one
variety
,
came
Greek
architecture
-LRB-
of
which
the
Roman
style
is
only
*NL*
a
continuation
-RRB-
,
surcharged
with
the
Carthaginian
dome
;
in
modern
*NL*
times
,
after
Romanesque
architecture
came
Gothic
architecture
.
And
by
*NL*
separating
there
three
series
into
their
component
parts
,
we
shall
find
*NL*
in
the
three
eldest
sisters
,
Hindoo
architecture
,
Egyptian
architecture
,
*NL*
Romanesque
architecture
,
the
same
symbol
;
that
is
to
say
,
theocracy
,
*NL*
caste
,
unity
,
dogma
,
myth
,
God
:
and
for
the
three
younger
sisters
,
*NL*
Phoenician
architecture
,
Greek
architecture
,
Gothic
architecture
,
*NL*
whatever
,
nevertheless
,
may
be
the
diversity
of
form
inherent
in
their
*NL*
nature
,
the
same
signification
also
;
that
is
to
say
,
liberty
,
the
*NL*
people
,
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
Hindu
,
Egyptian
,
or
Romanesque
architecture
,
one
feels
the
*NL*
priest
,
nothing
but
the
priest
,
whether
he
calls
himself
Brahmin
,
*NL*
Magian
,
or
Pope
.
It
is
not
the
same
in
the
architectures
of
the
people
.
*NL*
They
are
richer
and
less
sacred
.
In
the
Phoenician
,
one
feels
the
*NL*
merchant
;
in
the
Greek
,
the
republican
;
in
the
Gothic
,
the
citizen
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
general
characteristics
of
all
theocratic
architecture
are
*NL*
immutability
,
horror
of
progress
,
the
preservation
of
traditional
lines
,
*NL*
the
consecration
of
the
primitive
types
,
the
constant
bending
of
all
*NL*
the
forms
of
men
and
of
nature
to
the
incomprehensible
caprices
of
the
*NL*
symbol
.
These
are
dark
books
,
which
the
initiated
alone
understand
how
*NL*
to
decipher
.
Moreover
,
every
form
,
every
deformity
even
,
has
there
*NL*
a
sense
which
renders
it
inviolable
.
Do
not
ask
of
Hindoo
,
Egyptian
,
*NL*
Romanesque
masonry
to
reform
their
design
,
or
to
improve
their
*NL*
statuary
.
Every
attempt
at
perfecting
is
an
impiety
to
them
.
In
these
*NL*
architectures
it
seems
as
though
the
rigidity
of
the
dogma
had
*NL*
spread
over
the
stone
like
a
sort
of
second
petrifaction
.
The
general
*NL*
characteristics
of
popular
masonry
,
on
the
contrary
,
are
progress
,
*NL*
originality
,
opulence
,
perpetual
movement
.
They
are
already
sufficiently
*NL*
detached
from
religion
to
think
of
their
beauty
,
to
take
care
of
it
,
to
*NL*
correct
without
relaxation
their
parure
of
statues
or
arabesques
.
They
*NL*
are
of
the
age
.
They
have
something
human
,
which
they
mingle
incessantly
*NL*
with
the
divine
symbol
under
which
they
still
produce
.
Hence
,
*NL*
edifices
comprehensible
to
every
soul
,
to
every
intelligence
,
to
every
*NL*
imagination
,
symbolical
still
,
but
as
easy
to
understand
as
nature
.
*NL*
Between
theocratic
architecture
and
this
there
is
the
difference
*NL*
that
lies
between
a
sacred
language
and
a
vulgar
language
,
between
*NL*
hieroglyphics
and
art
,
between
Solomon
and
Phidias
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
reader
will
sum
up
what
we
have
hitherto
briefly
,
very
briefly
,
*NL*
indicated
,
neglecting
a
thousand
proofs
and
also
a
thousand
objections
*NL*
of
detail
,
he
will
be
led
to
this
:
that
architecture
was
,
down
to
the
*NL*
fifteenth
century
,
the
chief
register
of
humanity
;
that
in
that
interval
*NL*
not
a
thought
which
is
in
any
degree
complicated
made
its
appearance
in
*NL*
the
world
,
which
has
not
been
worked
into
an
edifice
;
that
every
popular
*NL*
idea
,
and
every
religious
law
,
has
had
its
monumental
records
;
that
*NL*
the
human
race
has
,
in
short
,
had
no
important
thought
which
it
has
not
*NL*
written
in
stone
.
And
why
?
Because
every
thought
,
either
philosophical
*NL*
or
religious
,
is
interested
in
perpetuating
itself
;
because
the
idea
*NL*
which
has
moved
one
generation
wishes
to
move
others
also
,
and
leave
a
*NL*
trace
.
Now
,
what
a
precarious
immortality
is
that
of
the
manuscript
!
How
*NL*
much
more
solid
,
durable
,
unyielding
,
is
a
book
of
stone
!
In
order
to
*NL*
destroy
the
written
word
,
a
torch
and
a
Turk
are
sufficient
.
To
demolish
*NL*
the
constructed
word
,
a
social
revolution
,
a
terrestrial
revolution
are
*NL*
required
.
The
barbarians
passed
over
the
Coliseum
;
the
deluge
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
passed
over
the
Pyramids
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
fifteenth
century
everything
changes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Human
thought
discovers
a
mode
of
perpetuating
itself
,
not
only
more
*NL*
durable
and
more
resisting
than
architecture
,
but
still
more
simple
and
*NL*
easy
.
Architecture
is
dethroned
.
Gutenberg
's
letters
of
lead
are
about
*NL*
to
supersede
Orpheus
's
letters
of

The
book
is
about
to
kill
the
edifice
*
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
invention
of
printing
is
the
greatest
event
in
history
.
It
is
the
*NL*
mother
of
revolution
.
It
is
the
mode
of
expression
of
humanity
which
is
*NL*
totally
renewed
;
it
is
human
thought
stripping
off
one
form
and
donning
*NL*
another
;
it
is
the
complete
and
definitive
change
of
skin
of
that
*NL*
symbolical
serpent
which
since
the
days
of
Adam
has
represented
*NL*
intelligence
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
its
printed
form
,
thought
is
more
imperishable
than
ever
;
it
is
*NL*
volatile
,
irresistible
,
indestructible
.
It
is
mingled
with
the
air
.
In
*NL*
the
days
of
architecture
it
made
a
mountain
of
itself
,
and
took
powerful
*NL*
possession
of
a
century
and
a
place
.
Now
it
converts
itself
into
a
flock
*NL*
of
birds
,
scatters
itself
to
the
four
winds
,
and
occupies
all
points
of
*NL*
air
and
space
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
repeat
,
who
does
not
perceive
that
in
this
form
it
is
far
more
*NL*
indelible
?
It
was
solid
,
it
has
become
alive
.
It
passes
from
duration
*NL*
in
time
to
immortality
.
One
can
demolish
a
mass
;
how
can
one
extirpate
*NL*
ubiquity
?
If
a
flood
comes
,
the
mountains
will
have
long
disappeared
*NL*
beneath
the
waves
,
while
the
birds
will
still
be
flying
about
;
and
if
a
*NL*
single
ark
floats
on
the
surface
of
the
cataclysm
,
they
will
alight
upon
*NL*
it
,
will
float
with
it
,
will
be
present
with
it
at
the
ebbing
of
the
*NL*
waters
;
and
the
new
world
which
emerges
from
this
chaos
will
behold
,
on
*NL*
its
awakening
,
the
thought
of
the
world
which
has
been
submerged
soaring
*NL*
above
it
,
winged
and
living
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
when
one
observes
that
this
mode
of
expression
is
not
only
the
most
*NL*
conservative
,
but
also
the
most
simple
,
the
most
convenient
,
the
most
*NL*
practicable
for
all
;
when
one
reflects
that
it
does
not
drag
after
it
*NL*
bulky
baggage
,
and
does
not
set
in
motion
a
heavy
apparatus
;
when
one
*NL*
compares
thought
forced
,
in
order
to
transform
itself
into
an
edifice
,
*NL*
to
put
in
motion
four
or
five
other
arts
and
tons
of
gold
,
a
whole
*NL*
mountain
of
stones
,
a
whole
forest
of
timber-work
,
a
whole
nation
of
*NL*
workmen
;
when
one
compares
it
to
the
thought
which
becomes
a
book
,
and
*NL*
for
which
a
little
paper
,
a
little
ink
,
and
a
pen
suffice
,
--
how
can
one
*NL*
be
surprised
that
human
intelligence
should
have
quitted
architecture
*NL*
for
printing
?
Cut
the
primitive
bed
of
a
river
abruptly
with
a
canal
*NL*
hollowed
out
below
its
level
,
and
the
river
will
desert
its
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Behold
how
,
beginning
with
the
discovery
of
printing
,
architecture
*NL*
withers
away
little
by
little
,
becomes
lifeless
and
bare
.
How
one
feels
*NL*
the
water
sinking
,
the
sap
departing
,
the
thought
of
the
times
and
of
*NL*
the
people
withdrawing
from
it
!
The
chill
is
almost
imperceptible
in
*NL*
the
fifteenth
century
;
the
press
is
,
as
yet
,
too
weak
,
and
,
at
the
*NL*
most
,
draws
from
powerful
architecture
a
superabundance
of
life
.
*NL*
But
practically
beginning
with
the
sixteenth
century
,
the
malady
of
*NL*
architecture
is
visible
;
it
is
no
longer
the
expression
of
society
;
it
*NL*
becomes
classic
art
in
a
miserable
manner
;
from
being
Gallic
,
European
,
*NL*
indigenous
,
it
becomes
Greek
and
Roman
;
from
being
true
and
modern
,
*NL*
it
becomes
pseudo-classic
.
It
is
this
decadence
which
is
called
the
*NL*
Renaissance
.
A
magnificent
decadence
,
however
,
for
the
ancient
Gothic
*NL*
genius
,
that
sun
which
sets
behind
the
gigantic
press
of
Mayence
,
still
*NL*
penetrates
for
a
while
longer
with
its
rays
that
whole
hybrid
pile
of
*NL*
Latin
arcades
and
Corinthian
columns
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
that
setting
sun
which
we
mistake
for
the
dawn
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
from
the
moment
when
architecture
is
no
longer
anything
*NL*
but
an
art
like
any
other
;
as
soon
as
it
is
no
longer
the
total
art
,
the
*NL*
sovereign
art
,
the
tyrant
art
,
--
it
has
no
longer
the
power
to
retain
*NL*
the
other
arts
.
So
they
emancipate
themselves
,
break
the
yoke
of
the
*NL*
architect
,
and
take
themselves
off
,
each
one
in
its
own
direction
.
Each
*NL*
one
of
them
gains
by
this
divorce
.
Isolation
aggrandizes
everything
.
*NL*
Sculpture
becomes
statuary
,
the
image
trade
becomes
painting
,
the
canon
*NL*
becomes
music
.
One
would
pronounce
it
an
empire
dismembered
at
the
death
*NL*
of
its
Alexander
,
and
whose
provinces
become
kingdoms
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hence
Raphael
,
Michael
Angelo
,
Jean
Goujon
,
Palestrina
,
those
splendors
*NL*
of
the
dazzling
sixteenth
century
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thought
emancipates
itself
in
all
directions
at
the
same
time
as
the
*NL*
arts
.
The
arch-heretics
of
the
Middle
Ages
had
already
made
large
*NL*
incisions
into
Catholicism
.
The
sixteenth
century
breaks
religious
*NL*
unity
.
Before
the
invention
of
printing
,
reform
would
have
been
merely
*NL*
a
schism
;
printing
converted
it
into
a
revolution
.
Take
away
the
press
;
*NL*
heresy
is
enervated
.
Whether
it
be
Providence
or
Fate
,
Gutenburg
is
the
*NL*
precursor
of
Luther
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
when
the
sun
of
the
Middle
Ages
is
completely
set
,
when
*NL*
the
Gothic
genius
is
forever
extinct
upon
the
horizon
,
architecture
*NL*
grows
dim
,
loses
its
color
,
becomes
more
and
more
effaced
.
The
printed
*NL*
book
,
the
gnawing
worm
of
the
edifice
,
sucks
and
devours
it
.
It
becomes
*NL*
bare
,
denuded
of
its
foliage
,
and
grows
visibly
emaciated
.
It
is
petty
,
*NL*
it
is
poor
,
it
is
nothing
.
It
no
longer
expresses
anything
,
not
even
the
*NL*
memory
of
the
art
of
another
time
.
Reduced
to
itself
,
abandoned
by
the
*NL*
other
arts
,
because
human
thought
is
abandoning
it
,
it
summons
*NL*
bunglers
in
place
of
artists
.
Glass
replaces
the
painted
windows
.
The
*NL*
stone-cutter
succeeds
the
sculptor
.
Farewell
all
sap
,
all
originality
,
*NL*
all
life
,
all
intelligence
.
It
drags
along
,
a
lamentable
workshop
*NL*
mendicant
,
from
copy
to
copy
.
Michael
Angelo
,
who
,
no
doubt
,
felt
even
*NL*
in
the
sixteenth
century
that
it
was
dying
,
had
a
last
idea
,
an
idea
of
*NL*
despair
.
That
Titan
of
art
piled
the
Pantheon
on
the
Parthenon
,
and
made
*NL*
Saint-Peter
's
at
Rome
.
A
great
work
,
which
deserved
to
remain
unique
,
*NL*
the
last
originality
of
architecture
,
the
signature
of
a
giant
artist
at
*NL*
the
bottom
of
the
colossal
register
of
stone
which
was
closed
forever
.
*NL*
With
Michael
Angelo
dead
,
what
does
this
miserable
architecture
,
which
*NL*
survived
itself
in
the
state
of
a
spectre
,
do
?
It
takes
Saint-Peter
*NL*
in
Rome
,
copies
it
and
parodies
it
.
It
is
a
mania
.
It
is
a
pity
.
Each
*NL*
century
has
its
Saint-Peter
's
of
Rome
;
in
the
seventeenth
century
,
the
*NL*
Val-de-Grace
;
in
the
eighteenth
,
Sainte-Genevieve
.
Each
country
has
its
*NL*
Saint-Peter
's
of
Rome
.
London
has
one
;
Petersburg
has
another
;
Paris
has
*NL*
two
or
three
.
The
insignificant
testament
,
the
last
dotage
of
a
decrepit
*NL*
grand
art
falling
back
into
infancy
before
it
dies
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
,
in
place
of
the
characteristic
monuments
which
we
have
just
*NL*
described
,
we
examine
the
general
aspect
of
art
from
the
sixteenth
*NL*
to
the
eighteenth
century
,
we
notice
the
same
phenomena
of
decay
and
*NL*
phthisis
.
Beginning
with
Francois
II.
,
the
architectural
form
of
the
*NL*
edifice
effaces
itself
more
and
more
,
and
allows
the
geometrical
form
,
*NL*
like
the
bony
structure
of
an
emaciated
invalid
,
to
become
prominent
.
*NL*
The
fine
lines
of
art
give
way
to
the
cold
and
inexorable
lines
of
*NL*
geometry
.
An
edifice
is
no
longer
an
edifice
;
it
is
a
polyhedron
.
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
architecture
is
tormented
in
her
struggles
to
conceal
this
*NL*
nudity
.
Look
at
the
Greek
pediment
inscribed
upon
the
Roman
pediment
,
*NL*
and
vice
versa
.
It
is
still
the
Pantheon
on
the
Parthenon
:
Saint-Peter
's
*NL*
of
Rome
.
Here
are
the
brick
houses
of
Henri
IV.
,
with
their
stone
*NL*
corners
;
the
Place
Royale
,
the
Place
Dauphine
.
Here
are
the
churches
*NL*
of
Louis
XIII.
,
heavy
,
squat
,
thickset
,
crowded
together
,
loaded
with
a
*NL*
dome
like
a
hump
.
Here
is
the
Mazarin
architecture
,
the
wretched
Italian
*NL*
pasticcio
of
the
Four
Nations
.
Here
are
the
palaces
of
Louis
XIV.
,
long
*NL*
barracks
for
courtiers
,
stiff
,
cold
,
tiresome
.
Here
,
finally
,
is
Louis
*NL*
XV.
,
with
chiccory
leaves
and
vermicelli
,
and
all
the
warts
,
and
all
*NL*
the
fungi
,
which
disfigure
that
decrepit
,
toothless
,
and
coquettish
old
*NL*
architecture
.
From
Francois
II
.
to
Louis
XV.
,
the
evil
has
increased
in
*NL*
geometrical
progression
.
Art
has
no
longer
anything
but
skin
upon
its
*NL*
bones
.
It
is
miserably
perishing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
what
becomes
of
printing
?
All
the
life
which
is
leaving
*NL*
architecture
comes
to
it
.
In
proportion
as
architecture
ebbs
,
printing
*NL*
swells
and
grows
.
That
capital
of
forces
which
human
thought
had
been
*NL*
expending
in
edifices
,
it
henceforth
expends
in
books
.
Thus
,
from
the
*NL*
sixteenth
century
onward
,
the
press
,
raised
to
the
level
of
decaying
*NL*
architecture
,
contends
with
it
and
kills
it
.
In
the
seventeenth
century
*NL*
it
is
already
sufficiently
the
sovereign
,
sufficiently
triumphant
,
*NL*
sufficiently
established
in
its
victory
,
to
give
to
the
world
the
feast
*NL*
of
a
great
literary
century
.
In
the
eighteenth
,
having
reposed
for
a
*NL*
long
time
at
the
Court
of
Louis
XIV.
,
it
seizes
again
the
old
sword
of
*NL*
Luther
,
puts
it
into
the
hand
of
Voltaire
,
and
rushes
impetuously
to
*NL*
the
attack
of
that
ancient
Europe
,
whose
architectural
expression
it
has
*NL*
already
killed
.
At
the
moment
when
the
eighteenth
century
comes
to
*NL*
an
end
,
it
has
destroyed
everything
.
In
the
nineteenth
,
it
begins
to
*NL*
reconstruct
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
we
ask
,
which
of
the
three
arts
has
really
represented
human
*NL*
thought
for
the
last
three
centuries
?
which
translates
it
?
which
*NL*
expresses
not
only
its
literary
and
scholastic
vagaries
,
but
its
vast
,
*NL*
profound
,
universal
movement
?
which
constantly
superposes
itself
,
*NL*
without
a
break
,
without
a
gap
,
upon
the
human
race
,
which
walks
a
*NL*
monster
with
a
thousand
legs
?
--
Architecture
or
printing
?
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
printing
.
Let
the
reader
make
no
mistake
;
architecture
is
dead
;
*NL*
irretrievably
slain
by
the
printed
book
,
--
slain
because
it
endures
for
*NL*
a
shorter
time
,
--
slain
because
it
costs
more
.
Every
cathedral
represents
*NL*
millions
.
Let
the
reader
now
imagine
what
an
investment
of
funds
it
*NL*
would
require
to
rewrite
the
architectural
book
;
to
cause
thousands
of
*NL*
edifices
to
swarm
once
more
upon
the
soil
;
to
return
to
those
epochs
*NL*
when
the
throng
of
monuments
was
such
,
according
to
the
statement
of
an
*NL*
eye
witness
,
``
that
one
would
have
said
that
the
world
in
shaking
itself
,
*NL*
had
cast
off
its
old
garments
in
order
to
cover
itself
with
a
white
*NL*
vesture
of
churches
.

A
book
is
so
soon
made
,
costs
so
little
,
and
can
go
so
far
!
How
can
it
*NL*
surprise
us
that
all
human
thought
flows
in
this
channel
?
This
does
not
*NL*
mean
that
architecture
will
not
still
have
a
fine
monument
,
an
isolated
*NL*
masterpiece
,
here
and
there
.
We
may
still
have
from
time
to
time
,
under
*NL*
the
reign
of
printing
,
a
column
made
I
suppose
,
by
a
whole
army
from
*NL*
melted
cannon
,
as
we
had
under
the
reign
of
architecture
,
Iliads
and
*NL*
Romanceros
,
Mahabahrata
,
and
Nibelungen
Lieds
,
made
by
a
whole
people
,
*NL*
with
rhapsodies
piled
up
and
melted
together
.
The
great
accident
of
an
*NL*
architect
of
genius
may
happen
in
the
twentieth
century
,
like
that
of
*NL*
Dante
in
the
thirteenth
.
But
architecture
will
no
longer
be
the
social
*NL*
art
,
the
collective
art
,
the
dominating
art
.
The
grand
poem
,
the
grand
*NL*
edifice
,
the
grand
work
of
humanity
will
no
longer
be
built
:
it
will
be
*NL*
printed
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
henceforth
,
if
architecture
should
arise
again
accidentally
,
it
will
*NL*
no
longer
be
mistress
.
It
will
be
subservient
to
the
law
of
literature
,
*NL*
which
formerly
received
the
law
from
it
.
The
respective
positions
of
the
*NL*
two
arts
will
be
inverted
.
It
is
certain
that
in
architectural
epochs
,
*NL*
the
poems
,
rare
it
is
true
,
resemble
the
monuments
.
In
India
,
Vyasa
is
*NL*
branching
,
strange
,
impenetrable
as
a
pagoda
.
In
Egyptian
Orient
,
poetry
*NL*
has
like
the
edifices
,
grandeur
and
tranquillity
of
line
;
in
antique
*NL*
Greece
,
beauty
,
serenity
,
calm
;
in
Christian
Europe
,
the
Catholic
*NL*
majesty
,
the
popular
naivete
,
the
rich
and
luxuriant
vegetation
of
*NL*
an
epoch
of
renewal
.
The
Bible
resembles
the
Pyramids
;
the
Iliad
,
the
*NL*
Parthenon
;
Homer
,
Phidias
.
Dante
in
the
thirteenth
century
is
the
*NL*
last
Romanesque
church
;
Shakespeare
in
the
sixteenth
,
the
last
Gothic
*NL*
cathedral
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
,
to
sum
up
what
we
have
hitherto
said
,
in
a
fashion
which
is
*NL*
necessarily
incomplete
and
mutilated
,
the
human
race
has
two
books
,
two
*NL*
registers
,
two
testaments
:
masonry
and
printing
;
the
Bible
of
stone
and
*NL*
the
Bible
of
paper
.
No
doubt
,
when
one
contemplates
these
two
Bibles
,
*NL*
laid
so
broadly
open
in
the
centuries
,
it
is
permissible
to
regret
the
*NL*
visible
majesty
of
the
writing
of
granite
,
those
gigantic
alphabets
*NL*
formulated
in
colonnades
,
in
pylons
,
in
obelisks
,
those
sorts
of
human
*NL*
mountains
which
cover
the
world
and
the
past
,
from
the
pyramid
to
the
*NL*
bell
tower
,
from
Cheops
to
Strasburg
.
The
past
must
be
reread
upon
these
*NL*
pages
of
marble
.
This
book
,
written
by
architecture
,
must
be
admired
*NL*
and
perused
incessantly
;
but
the
grandeur
of
the
edifice
which
printing
*NL*
erects
in
its
turn
must
not
be
denied
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
edifice
is
colossal
.
Some
compiler
of
statistics
has
calculated
,
*NL*
that
if
all
the
volumes
which
have
issued
from
the
press
since
*NL*
Gutenberg
's
day
were
to
be
piled
one
upon
another
,
they
would
fill
*NL*
the
space
between
the
earth
and
the
moon
;
but
it
is
not
that
sort
of
*NL*
grandeur
of
which
we
wished
to
speak
.
Nevertheless
,
when
one
tries
to
*NL*
collect
in
one
's
mind
a
comprehensive
image
of
the
total
products
of
*NL*
printing
down
to
our
own
days
,
does
not
that
total
appear
to
us
like
an
*NL*
immense
construction
,
resting
upon
the
entire
world
,
at
which
humanity
*NL*
toils
without
relaxation
,
and
whose
monstrous
crest
is
lost
in
the
*NL*
profound
mists
of
the
future
?
It
is
the
anthill
of
intelligence
.
It
is
*NL*
the
hive
whither
come
all
imaginations
,
those
golden
bees
,
with
their
*NL*
honey
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
edifice
has
a
thousand
stories
.
Here
and
there
one
beholds
on
its
*NL*
staircases
the
gloomy
caverns
of
science
which
pierce
its
interior
.
*NL*
Everywhere
upon
its
surface
,
art
causes
its
arabesques
,
rosettes
,
and
*NL*
laces
to
thrive
luxuriantly
before
the
eyes
.
There
,
every
individual
*NL*
work
,
however
capricious
and
isolated
it
may
seem
,
has
its
place
and
*NL*
its
projection
.
Harmony
results
from
the
whole
.
From
the
cathedral
of
*NL*
Shakespeare
to
the
mosque
of
Byron
,
a
thousand
tiny
bell
towers
are
*NL*
piled
pell-mell
above
this
metropolis
of
universal
thought
.
At
its
base
*NL*
are
written
some
ancient
titles
of
humanity
which
architecture
had
*NL*
not
registered
.
To
the
left
of
the
entrance
has
been
fixed
the
ancient
*NL*
bas-relief
,
in
white
marble
,
of
Homer
;
to
the
right
,
the
polyglot
Bible
*NL*
rears
its
seven
heads
.
The
hydra
of
the
Romancero
and
some
other
hybrid
*NL*
forms
,
the
Vedas
and
the
Nibelungen
bristle
further
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
the
prodigious
edifice
still
remains
incomplete
.
The
*NL*
press
,
that
giant
machine
,
which
incessantly
pumps
all
the
intellectual
*NL*
sap
of
society
,
belches
forth
without
pause
fresh
materials
for
its
*NL*
work
.
The
whole
human
race
is
on
the
scaffoldings
.
Each
mind
is
a
mason
.
*NL*
The
humblest
fills
his
hole
,
or
places
his
stone
.
Retif
de

*NL*
brings
his
hod
of
plaster
.
Every
day
a
new
course
rises
.
Independently
*NL*
of
the
original
and
individual
contribution
of
each
writer
,
there
are
*NL*
collective
contingents
.
The
eighteenth
century
gives
the
_
Encyclopedia

,
*NL*
the

Assuredly
,
it
is
a

up

CHAPTER
I
.
AN
IMPARTIAL
GLANCE
AT
THE
ANCIENT
MAGISTRACY
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
very
happy
personage
in
the
year
of
grace
1482
,
was
the
noble
*NL*
gentleman
Robert
d'Estouteville
,
chevalier
,
Sieur
de
Beyne
,
Baron
d'Ivry
*NL*
and
Saint
Andry
en
la
Marche
,
counsellor
and
chamberlain
to
the
king
,
*NL*
and
guard
of
the
provostship
of
Paris
.
It
was
already
nearly
seventeen
*NL*
years
since
he
had
received
from
the
king
,
on
November
7
,
1465
,
the
*NL*
comet
year
,
*
that
fine
charge
of
the
provostship
of
Paris
,
which
was
*NL*
reputed
rather
a
seigneury
than
an
office
.
_
Dignitas
_
,
says
Joannes
*NL*
Loemnoeus
,
_
quae
cum
non
exigua
potestate
politiam
concernente
,
atque
*NL*
proerogativis
multis
et
juribus
conjuncta
est
_
.
A
marvellous
thing
in
*NL*
'82
was
a
gentleman
bearing
the
king
's
commission
,
and
whose
letters
*NL*
of
institution
ran
back
to
the
epoch
of
the
marriage
of
the
natural
*NL*
daughter
of
Louis
XI
.
with
Monsieur
the
Bastard
of
Bourbon
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
This
comet
against
which
Pope
Calixtus
,
uncle
of
Borgia
,
*NL*
ordered
public
prayers
,
is
the
same
which
reappeared
in
1835
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
same
day
on
which
Robert
d'Estouteville
took
the
place
of
Jacques
*NL*
de
Villiers
in
the
provostship
of
Paris
,
Master
Jehan
Dauvet
replaced
*NL*
Messire
Helye
de
Thorrettes
in
the
first
presidency
of
the
Court
of
*NL*
Parliament
,
Jehan
Jouvenel
des
Ursins
supplanted
Pierre
de
Morvilliers
*NL*
in
the
office
of
chancellor
of
France
,
Regnault
des
Dormans
ousted
*NL*
Pierre
Puy
from
the
charge
of
master
of
requests
in
ordinary
of
the
*NL*
king
's
household
.
Now
,
upon
how
many
heads
had
the
presidency
,
the
*NL*
chancellorship
,
the
mastership
passed
since
Robert
d'Estouteville
*NL*
had
held
the
provostship
of
Paris
.
It
had
been
``
granted
to
him
for
*NL*
safekeeping
,
''
as
the
letters
patent
said
;
and
certainly
he
kept
it
*NL*
well
.
He
had
clung
to
it
,
he
had
incorporated
himself
with
it
,
he
had
*NL*
so
identified
himself
with
it
that
he
had
escaped
that
fury
for
change
*NL*
which
possessed
Louis
XI.
,
a
tormenting
and
industrious
king
,
whose
*NL*
policy
it
was
to
maintain
the
elasticity
of
his
power
by
frequent
*NL*
appointments
and
revocations
.
More
than
this
;
the
brave
chevalier
had
*NL*
obtained
the
reversion
of
the
office
for
his
son
,
and
for
two
years
*NL*
already
,
the
name
of
the
noble
man
Jacques
d'Estouteville
,
equerry
,
had
*NL*
figured
beside
his
at
the
head
of
the
register
of
the
salary
list
of
the
*NL*
provostship
of
Paris
.
A
rare
and
notable
favor
indeed
!
It
is
true
that
*NL*
Robert
d'Estouteville
was
a
good
soldier
,
that
he
had
loyally
raised
his
*NL*
pennon
against
``
the
league
of
public
good
,
''
and
that
he
had
presented
*NL*
to
the
queen
a
very
marvellous
stag
in
confectionery
on
the
day
of
her
*NL*
entrance
to
Paris
in
14
...
Moreover
,
he
possessed
the
good
friendship
*NL*
of
Messire
Tristan
l'Hermite
,
provost
of
the
marshals
of
the
king
's
*NL*
household
.
Hence
a
very
sweet
and
pleasant
existence
was
that
of
Messire
*NL*
Robert
.
In
the
first
place
,
very
good
wages
,
to
which
were
attached
,
and
*NL*
from
which
hung
,
like
extra
bunches
of
grapes
on
his
vine
,
the
revenues
*NL*
of
the
civil
and
criminal
registries
of
the
provostship
,
plus
the
civil
*NL*
and
criminal
revenues
of
the
tribunals
of
Embas
of
the
Chatelet
,
without
*NL*
reckoning
some
little
toll
from
the
bridges
of
Mantes
and
of
Corbeil
,
*NL*
and
the
profits
on
the
craft
of
Shagreen-makers
of
Paris
,
on
the
corders
*NL*
of
firewood
and
the
measurers
of
salt
.
Add
to
this
the
pleasure
of
*NL*
displaying
himself
in
rides
about
the
city
,
and
of
making
his
fine
*NL*
military
costume
,
which
you
may
still
admire
sculptured
on
his
tomb
*NL*
in
the
abbey
of
Valmont
in
Normandy
,
and
his
morion
,
all
embossed
at
*NL*
Montlhery
,
stand
out
a
contrast
against
the
parti-colored
red
and
tawny
*NL*
robes
of
the
aldermen
and
police
.
And
then
,
was
it
nothing
to
wield
*NL*
absolute
supremacy
over
the
sergeants
of
the
police
,
the
porter
and
*NL*
watch
of
the
Chatelet
,
the
two
auditors
of
the
Chatelet
,
_
auditores
*NL*
castelleti
_
,
the
sixteen
commissioners
of
the
sixteen
quarters
,
the
*NL*
jailer
of
the
Chatelet
,
the
four
enfeoffed
sergeants
,
the
hundred
and
*NL*
twenty
mounted
sergeants
,
with
maces
,
the
chevalier
of
the
watch
with
*NL*
his
watch
,
his
sub-watch
,
his
counter-watch
and
his
rear-watch
?
Was
it
*NL*
nothing
to
exercise
high
and
low
justice
,
the
right
to
interrogate
,
*NL*
to
hang
and
to
draw
,
without
reckoning
petty
jurisdiction
in
the
first
*NL*
resort
-LRB-
_
in
prima
instantia
_
,
as
the
charters
say
-RRB-
,
on
that
viscomty
*NL*
of
Paris
,
so
nobly
appanaged
with
seven
noble
bailiwicks
?
Can
anything
*NL*
sweeter
be
imagined
than
rendering
judgments
and
decisions
,
as
Messire
*NL*
Robert
d'Estouteville
daily
did
in
the
Grand
Chatelet
,
under
the
large
*NL*
and
flattened
arches
of
Philip
Augustus
?
and
going
,
as
he
was
wont
to
*NL*
do
every
evening
,
to
that
charming
house
situated
in
the
Rue
Galilee
,
in
*NL*
the
enclosure
of
the
royal
palace
,
which
he
held
in
right
of
his
wife
,
*NL*
Madame
Ambroise
de
Lore
,
to
repose
after
the
fatigue
of
having
sent
*NL*
some
poor
wretch
to
pass
the
night
in
``
that
little
cell
of
the
Rue
de
*NL*
Escorcherie
,
which
the
provosts
and
aldermen
of
Paris
used
to
make
their
*NL*
prison
;
the
same
being
eleven
feet
long
,
seven
feet
and
four
inches
*NL*
wide
,
and
eleven
feet
high
?

*NL*
*NL*
And
not
only
had
Messire
Robert
d'Estouteville
his
special
court
as
*NL*
provost
and
vicomte
of
Paris
;
but
in
addition
he
had
a
share
,
both
for
*NL*
eye
and
tooth
,
in
the
grand
court
of
the
king
.
There
was
no
head
in
the
*NL*
least
elevated
which
had
not
passed
through
his
hands
before
it
came
to
*NL*
the
headsman
.
It
was
he
who
went
to
seek
M.
de
Nemours
at
the
Bastille
*NL*
Saint
Antoine
,
in
order
to
conduct
him
to
the
Halles
;
and
to
conduct
to
*NL*
the
Greve
M.
de
Saint-Pol
,
who
clamored
and
resisted
,
to
the
great
joy
*NL*
of
the
provost
,
who
did
not
love
monsieur
the
constable
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
,
assuredly
,
is
more
than
sufficient
to
render
a
life
happy
and
*NL*
illustrious
,
and
to
deserve
some
day
a
notable
page
in
that
interesting
*NL*
history
of
the
provosts
of
Paris
,
where
one
learns
that
Oudard
de
*NL*
Villeneuve
had
a
house
in
the
Rue
des
Boucheries
,
that
Guillaume
*NL*
de
Hangest
purchased
the
great
and
the
little
Savoy
,
that
Guillaume
*NL*
Thiboust
gave
the
nuns
of
Sainte-Genevieve
his
houses
in
the
Rue
Clopin
,
*NL*
that
Hugues
Aubriot
lived
in
the
Hotel
du
Pore-Epic
,
and
other
domestic
*NL*
facts
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
with
so
many
reasons
for
taking
life
patiently
and
*NL*
joyously
,
Messire
Robert
d'Estouteville
woke
up
on
the
morning
of
the
*NL*
seventh
of
January
,
1482
,
in
a
very
surly
and
peevish
mood
.
Whence
came
*NL*
this
ill
temper
?
He
could
not
have
told
himself
.
Was
it
because
the
sky
*NL*
was
gray
?
or
was
the
buckle
of
his
old
belt
of
Montlhery
badly
fastened
,
*NL*
so
that
it
confined
his
provostal
portliness
too
closely
?
had
he
beheld
*NL*
ribald
fellows
,
marching
in
bands
of
four
,
beneath
his
window
,
and
*NL*
setting
him
at
defiance
,
in
doublets
but
no
shirts
,
hats
without
crowns
,
*NL*
with
wallet
and
bottle
at
their
side
?
Was
it
a
vague
presentiment
of
the
*NL*
three
hundred
and
seventy
livres
,
sixteen
sous
,
eight
farthings
,
which
*NL*
the
future
King
Charles
VII
.
was
to
cut
off
from
the
provostship
in
the
*NL*
following
year
?
The
reader
can
take
his
choice
;
we
,
for
our
part
,
are
*NL*
much
inclined
to
believe
that
he
was
in
a
bad
humor
,
simply
because
he
*NL*
was
in
a
bad
humor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
it
was
the
day
after
a
festival
,
a
tiresome
day
for
every
one
,
*NL*
and
above
all
for
the
magistrate
who
is
charged
with
sweeping
away
all
*NL*
the
filth
,
properly
and
figuratively
speaking
,
which
a
festival
day
*NL*
produces
in
Paris
.
And
then
he
had
to
hold
a
sitting
at
the
Grand
*NL*
Chatelet
.
Now
,
we
have
noticed
that
judges
in
general
so
arrange
matters
*NL*
that
their
day
of
audience
shall
also
be
their
day
of
bad
humor
,
so
that
*NL*
they
may
always
have
some
one
upon
whom
to
vent
it
conveniently
,
in
the
*NL*
name
of
the
king
,
law
,
and
justice
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
the
audience
had
begun
without
him
.
His
lieutenants
,
civil
,
*NL*
criminal
,
and
private
,
were
doing
his
work
,
according
to
usage
;
and
*NL*
from
eight
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
some
scores
of
bourgeois
and
*NL*
_
bourgeoises
_
,
heaped
and
crowded
into
an
obscure
corner
of
the
audience
*NL*
chamber
of
Embas
du
Chatelet
,
between
a
stout
oaken
barrier
and
the
*NL*
wall
,
had
been
gazing
blissfully
at
the
varied
and
cheerful
spectacle
of
*NL*
civil
and
criminal
justice
dispensed
by
Master
Florian
Barbedienne
,
*NL*
auditor
of
the
Chatelet
,
lieutenant
of
monsieur
the
provost
,
in
a
*NL*
somewhat
confused
and
utterly
haphazard
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hall
was
small
,
low
,
vaulted
.
A
table
studded
with
fleurs-de-lis
*NL*
stood
at
one
end
,
with
a
large
arm-chair
of
carved
oak
,
which
belonged
*NL*
to
the
provost
and
was
empty
,
and
a
stool
on
the
left
for
the
auditor
,
*NL*
Master
Florian
.
Below
sat
the
clerk
of
the
court
,
scribbling
;
opposite
*NL*
was
the
populace
;
and
in
front
of
the
door
,
and
in
front
of
the
table
*NL*
were
many
sergeants
of
the
provostship
in
sleeveless
jackets
of
violet
*NL*
camlet
,
with
white
crosses
.
Two
sergeants
of
the
Parloir-aux-Bourgeois
,
*NL*
clothed
in
their
jackets
of
Toussaint
,
half
red
,
half
blue
,
were
*NL*
posted
as
sentinels
before
a
low
,
closed
door
,
which
was
visible
at
*NL*
the
extremity
of
the
hall
,
behind
the
table
.
A
single
pointed
window
,
*NL*
narrowly
encased
in
the
thick
wall
,
illuminated
with
a
pale
ray
of
*NL*
January
sun
two
grotesque
figures
,
--
the
capricious
demon
of
stone
carved
*NL*
as
a
tail-piece
in
the
keystone
of
the
vaulted
ceiling
,
and
the
judge
*NL*
seated
at
the
end
of
the
hall
on
the
fleurs-de-lis
.
*NL*
*NL*
Imagine
,
in
fact
,
at
the
provost
's
table
,
leaning
upon
his
elbows
*NL*
between
two
bundles
of
documents
of
cases
,
with
his
foot
on
the
train
*NL*
of
his
robe
of
plain
brown
cloth
,
his
face
buried
in
his
hood
of
white
*NL*
lamb
's
skin
,
of
which
his
brows
seemed
to
be
of
a
piece
,
red
,
crabbed
,
*NL*
winking
,
bearing
majestically
the
load
of
fat
on
his
cheeks
which
met
*NL*
under
his
chin
,
Master
Florian
Barbedienne
,
auditor
of
the
Chatelet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
the
auditor
was
deaf
.
A
slight
defect
in
an
auditor
.
Master
Florian
*NL*
delivered
judgment
,
none
the
less
,
without
appeal
and
very
suitably
.
It
*NL*
is
certainly
quite
sufficient
for
a
judge
to
have
the
air
of
listening
;
*NL*
and
the
venerable
auditor
fulfilled
this
condition
,
the
sole
one
in
*NL*
justice
,
all
the
better
because
his
attention
could
not
be
distracted
by
*NL*
any
noise
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
he
had
in
the
audience
,
a
pitiless
censor
of
his
deeds
and
*NL*
gestures
,
in
the
person
of
our
friend
Jehan
Frollo
du
Moulin
,
that
*NL*
little
student
of
yesterday
,
that
``
stroller
,
''
whom
one
was
sure
of
*NL*
encountering
all
over
Paris
,
anywhere
except
before
the
rostrums
of
the
*NL*
professors
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay

''
he
said
in
a
low
tone
to
his
companion
,
Robin
Poussepain
,
who
*NL*
was
grinning
at
his
side
,
while
he
was
making
his
comments
on
the
scenes
*NL*
which
were
being
unfolded
before
his
eyes
,
``

our

,
*NL*
our

,
our
one-eyed
man
,
our
hunchback
,
our
grimace
!
'T
is
*NL*
Quasimodo
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
he
indeed
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Quasimodo
,
bound
,
encircled
,
roped
,
pinioned
,
and
under
good
*NL*
guard
.
The
squad
of
policemen
who
surrounded
him
was
assisted
by
the
*NL*
chevalier
of
the
watch
in
person
,
wearing
the
arms
of
France
embroidered
*NL*
on
his
breast
,
and
the
arms
of
the
city
on
his
back
.
There
was
nothing
,
*NL*
however
,
about
Quasimodo
,
except
his
deformity
,
which
could
justify
the
*NL*
display
of
halberds
and
arquebuses
;
he
was
gloomy
,
silent
,
and
tranquil
.
*NL*
Only
now
and
then
did
his
single
eye
cast
a
sly
and
wrathful
glance
upon
*NL*
the
bonds
with
which
he
was
loaded
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
cast
the
same
glance
about
him
,
but
it
was
so
dull
and
sleepy
that
*NL*
the
women
only
pointed
him
out
to
each
other
in
derision
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
Master
Florian
,
the
auditor
,
turned
over
attentively
the
*NL*
document
in
the
complaint
entered
against
Quasimodo
,
which
the
clerk
*NL*
handed
him
,
and
,
having
thus
glanced
at
it
,
appeared
to
reflect
for
a
*NL*
moment
.
Thanks
to
this
precaution
,
which
he
always
was
careful
to
take
*NL*
at
the
moment
when
on
the
point
of
beginning
an
examination
,
he
knew
*NL*
beforehand
the
names
,
titles
,
and
misdeeds
of
the
accused
,
made
cut
*NL*
and
dried
responses
to
questions
foreseen
,
and
succeeded
in
extricating
*NL*
himself
from
all
the
windings
of
the
interrogation
without
allowing
his
*NL*
deafness
to
be
too
apparent
.
The
written
charges
were
to
him
what
the
*NL*
dog
is
to
the
blind
man
.
If
his
deafness
did
happen
to
betray
him
*NL*
here
and
there
,
by
some
incoherent
apostrophe
or
some
unintelligible
*NL*
question
,
it
passed
for
profundity
with
some
,
and
for
imbecility
with
*NL*
others
.
In
neither
case
did
the
honor
of
the
magistracy
sustain
any
*NL*
injury
;
for
it
is
far
better
that
a
judge
should
be
reputed
imbecile
*NL*
or
profound
than
deaf
.
Hence
he
took
great
care
to
conceal
his
deafness
*NL*
from
the
eyes
of
all
,
and
he
generally
succeeded
so
well
that
he
had
*NL*
reached
the
point
of
deluding
himself
,
which
is
,
by
the
way
,
easier
*NL*
than
is
supposed
.
All
hunchbacks
walk
with
their
heads
held
high
,
all
*NL*
stutterers
harangue
,
all
deaf
people
speak
low
.
As
for
him
,
he
believed
,
*NL*
at
the
most
,
that
his
ear
was
a
little
refractory
.
It
was
the
sole
*NL*
concession
which
he
made
on
this
point
to
public
opinion
,
in
his
moments
*NL*
of
frankness
and
examination
of
his
conscience
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
,
then
,
thoroughly
ruminated
Quasimodo
's
affair
,
he
threw
back
*NL*
his
head
and
half
closed
his
eyes
,
for
the
sake
of
more
majesty
and
*NL*
impartiality
,
so
that
,
at
that
moment
,
he
was
both
deaf
and
blind
.
A
*NL*
double
condition
,
without
which
no
judge
is
perfect
.
It
was
in
this
*NL*
magisterial
attitude
that
he
began
the
examination
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Now
this
was
a
case
which
had
not
been
``
provided
for
by
law
,
''
where
a
*NL*
deaf
man
should
be
obliged
to
question
a
deaf
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Quasimodo
,
whom
nothing
warned
that
a
question
had
been
addressed
to
*NL*
him
,
continued
to
stare
intently
at
the
judge
,
and
made
no
reply
.
The
*NL*
judge
,
being
deaf
,
and
being
in
no
way
warned
of
the
deafness
of
the
*NL*
accused
,
thought
that
the
latter
had
answered
,
as
all
accused
do
in
*NL*
general
,
and
therefore
he
pursued
,
with
his
mechanical
and
stupid
*NL*
self-possession
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
.
And
your
age
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
Quasimodo
made
no
reply
to
this
question
.
The
judge
supposed
that
*NL*
it
had
been
replied
to
,
and
continued
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
your
profession
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Still
the
same
silence
.
The
spectators
had
begun
,
meanwhile
,
to
whisper
*NL*
together
,
and
to
exchange
glances
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
do
,
''
went
on
the
imperturbable
auditor
,
when
he
supposed
that
*NL*
the
accused
had
finished
his
third
reply
.
``
You
are
accused
before
us
,
*NL*
_
primo
_
,
of
nocturnal
disturbance
;
_
secundo
_
,
of
a
dishonorable
act
*NL*
of
violence
upon
the
person
of
a
foolish
woman
,
_
in
proejudicium
*NL*
meretricis
;
tertio
_
,
of
rebellion
and
disloyalty
towards
the
archers
*NL*
of
the
police
of
our
lord
,
the
king
.
Explain
yourself
upon
all
these
*NL*
points
.
--
Clerk
,
have
you
written
down
what
the
prisoner
has
said
thus
*NL*
far
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
unlucky
question
,
a
burst
of
laughter
rose
from
the
clerk
's
*NL*
table
caught
by
the
audience
,
so
violent
,
so
wild
,
so
contagious
,
so
*NL*
universal
,
that
the
two
deaf
men
were
forced
to
perceive
it
.
Quasimodo
*NL*
turned
round
,
shrugging
his
hump
with
disdain
,
while
Master
Florian
,
*NL*
equally
astonished
,
and
supposing
that
the
laughter
of
the
spectators
*NL*
had
been
provoked
by
some
irreverent
reply
from
the
accused
,
rendered
*NL*
visible
to
him
by
that
shrug
of
the
shoulders
,
apostrophized
him
*NL*
indignantly
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
uttered
a
reply
,
knave
,
which
deserves
the
halter
.
Do
you
know
*NL*
to
whom
you
are
speaking
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
sally
was
not
fitted
to
arrest
the
explosion
of
general
merriment
.
*NL*
It
struck
all
as
so
whimsical
,
and
so
ridiculous
,
that
the
wild
laughter
*NL*
even
attacked
the
sergeants
of
the
Parloi-aux-Bourgeois
,
a
sort
of
*NL*
pikemen
,
whose
stupidity
was
part
of
their
uniform
.
Quasimodo
alone
*NL*
preserved
his
seriousness
,
for
the
good
reason
that
he
understood
*NL*
nothing
of
what
was
going
on
around
him
.
The
judge
,
more
and
more
*NL*
irritated
,
thought
it
his
duty
to
continue
in
the
same
tone
,
hoping
*NL*
thereby
to
strike
the
accused
with
a
terror
which
should
react
upon
the
*NL*
audience
,
and
bring
it
back
to
respect
.

suddenly
opened
,
and
given
entrance
*NL*
to
the
provost
in
person
.
At
his
entrance
Master
Florian
did
not
stop
*NL*
short
,
but
,
making
a
half-turn
on
his
heels
,
and
aiming
at
the
provost
*NL*
the
harangue
with
which
he
had
been
withering
Quasimodo
a
moment
*NL*
before
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monseigneur
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
demand
such
penalty
as
you
shall
deem
fitting
*NL*
against
the
prisoner
here
present
,
for
grave
and
aggravated
offence
*NL*
against
the
court
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
seated
himself
,
utterly
breathless
,
wiping
away
the
great
*NL*
drops
of
sweat
which
fell
from
his
brow
and
drenched
,
like
tears
,
the
*NL*
parchments
spread
out
before
him
.
Messire
Robert
d'Estouteville
frowned
*NL*
and
made
a
gesture
so
imperious
and
significant
to
Quasimodo
,
that
the
*NL*
deaf
man
in
some
measure
understood
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
provost
addressed
him
with
severity
,
``
What
have
you
done
that
you
*NL*
have
been
brought
hither
,
knave
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
fellow
,
supposing
that
the
provost
was
asking
his
name
,
broke
*NL*
the
silence
which
he
habitually
preserved
,
and
replied
,
in
a
harsh
and
*NL*
guttural
voice
,
``
Quasimodo
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
reply
matched
the
question
so
little
that
the
wild
laugh
began
to
*NL*
circulate
once
more
,
and
Messire
Robert
exclaimed
,
red
with
wrath
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
mocking
me
also
,
you
arrant
knave
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bellringer
of
Notre-Dame
,
''
replied
Quasimodo
,
supposing
that
what
was
*NL*
required
of
him
was
to
explain
to
the
judge
who
he
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bellringer
!
''
interpolated
the
provost
,
who
had
waked
up
early
enough
to
*NL*
be
in
a
sufficiently
bad
temper
,
as
we
have
said
,
not
to
require
to
have
*NL*
his
fury
inflamed
by
such
strange
responses
.
``
Bellringer
!
I
'll
play
you
*NL*
a
chime
of
rods
on
your
back
through
the
squares
of
Paris
!
Do
you
hear
,
*NL*
knave
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
is
my
age
that
you
wish
to
know
,
''
said
Quasimodo
,
``
I
think
that
I
*NL*
shall
be
twenty
at
Saint
Martin
's
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
too
much
;
the
provost
could
no
longer
restrain
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
you
are
scoffing
at
the
provostship
,
wretch
!
Messieurs
the
*NL*
sergeants
of
the
mace
,
you
will
take
me
this
knave
to
the
pillory
of
the
*NL*
Greve
,
you
will
flog
him
,
and
turn
him
for
an
hour
.
He
shall
pay
me
for
*NL*
it
,
_
tete
Dieu
_
!
And
I
order
that
the
present
judgment
shall
be
cried
,
*NL*
with
the
assistance
of
four
sworn
trumpeters
,
in
the
seven
castellanies
*NL*
of
the
viscomty
of
Paris
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
clerk
set
to
work
incontinently
to
draw
up
the
account
of
the
*NL*
sentence
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Ventre
Dieu
_
!
't
is
well
adjudged
!
''
cried
the
little
scholar
,
Jehan
*NL*
Frollo
du
Moulin
,
from
his
corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
provost
turned
and
fixed
his
flashing
eyes
once
more
on
Quasimodo
.
*NL*
``
I
believe
the
knave
said
'
_
Ventre
Dieu
_
'
Clerk
,
add
twelve
deniers
*NL*
Parisian
for
the
oath
,
and
let
the
vestry
of
Saint
Eustache
have
the
*NL*
half
of
it
;
I
have
a
particular
devotion
for
Saint
Eustache
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
few
minutes
the
sentence
was
drawn
up
.
Its
tenor
was
simple
and
*NL*
brief
.
The
customs
of
the
provostship
and
the
viscomty
had
not
yet
*NL*
been
worked
over
by
President
Thibaut
Baillet
,
and
by
Roger
Barmne
,
the
*NL*
king
's
advocate
;
they
had
not
been
obstructed
,
at
that
time
,
by
that
*NL*
lofty
hedge
of
quibbles
and
procedures
,
which
the
two
jurisconsults
*NL*
planted
there
at
the
beginning
of
the
sixteenth
century
.
All
was
clear
,
*NL*
expeditious
,
explicit
.
One
went
straight
to
the
point
then
,
and
at
the
*NL*
end
of
every
path
there
was
immediately
visible
,
without
thickets
and
*NL*
without
turnings
;
the
wheel
,
the
gibbet
,
or
the
pillory
.
One
at
least
*NL*
knew
whither
one
was
going
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
clerk
presented
the
sentence
to
the
provost
,
who
affixed
his
seal
to
*NL*
it
,
and
departed
to
pursue
his
round
of
the
audience
hall
,
in
a
frame
*NL*
of
mind
which
seemed
destined
to
fill
all
the
jails
in
Paris
that
day
.
*NL*
Jehan
Frollo
and
Robin
Poussepain
laughed
in
their
sleeves
.
Quasimodo
*NL*
gazed
on
the
whole
with
an
indifferent
and
astonished
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
at
the
moment
when
Master
Florian
Barbedienne
was
reading
the
*NL*
sentence
in
his
turn
,
before
signing
it
,
the
clerk
felt
himself
moved
*NL*
with
pity
for
the
poor
wretch
of
a
prisoner
,
and
,
in
the
hope
of
*NL*
obtaining
some
mitigation
of
the
penalty
,
he
approached
as
near
the
*NL*
auditor
's
ear
as
possible
,
and
said
,
pointing
to
Quasimodo
,
``
That
man
is
*NL*
deaf
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
hoped
that
this
community
of
infirmity
would
awaken
Master
Florian
's
*NL*
interest
in
behalf
of
the
condemned
man
.
But
,
in
the
first
place
,
we
*NL*
have
already
observed
that
Master
Florian
did
not
care
to
have
his
*NL*
deafness
noticed
.
In
the
next
place
,
he
was
so
hard
of
hearing
That
he
*NL*
did
not
catch
a
single
word
of
what
the
clerk
said
to
him
;
nevertheless
,
*NL*
he
wished
to
have
the
appearance
of
hearing
,
and
replied
,
``
Ah
!
ah
!
that
*NL*
is
different
;
I
did
not
know
that
.
An
hour
more
of
the
pillory
,
in
that
*NL*
case
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
signed
the
sentence
thus
modified
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
well
done
,
''
said
Robin
Poussepain
,
who
cherished
a
grudge
against
*NL*
Quasimodo
.
``
That
will
teach
him
to
handle
people
roughly
.

CHAPTER
II
.
THE
RAT-HOLE
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
must
permit
us
to
take
him
back
to
the
Place
de
Greve
,
which
*NL*
we
quitted
yesterday
with
Gringoire
,
in
order
to
follow
la
Esmeralda
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
ten
o'clock
in
the
morning
;
everything
is
indicative
of
the
day
*NL*
after
a
festival
.
The
pavement
is
covered
with
rubbish
;
ribbons
,
rags
,
*NL*
feathers
from
tufts
of
plumes
,
drops
of
wax
from
the
torches
,
crumbs
of
*NL*
the
public
feast
.
A
goodly
number
of
bourgeois
are
``
sauntering
,
''
as
we
*NL*
say
,
here
and
there
,
turning
over
with
their
feet
the
extinct
brands
of
*NL*
the
bonfire
,
going
into
raptures
in
front
of
the
Pillar
House
,
over
the
*NL*
memory
of
the
fine
hangings
of
the
day
before
,
and
to-day
staring
at
the
*NL*
nails
that
secured
them
a
last
pleasure
.
The
venders
of
cider
and
beer
*NL*
are
rolling
their
barrels
among
the
groups
.
Some
busy
passers-by
*NL*
come
and
go
.
The
merchants
converse
and
call
to
each
other
from
the
*NL*
thresholds
of
their
shops
.
The
festival
,
the
ambassadors
,
Coppenole
,
*NL*
the
Pope
of
the
Fools
,
are
in
all
mouths
;
they
vie
with
each
other
,
each
*NL*
trying
to
criticise
it
best
and
laugh
the
most
.
And
,
meanwhile
,
four
*NL*
mounted
sergeants
,
who
have
just
posted
themselves
at
the
four
sides
*NL*
of
the
pillory
,
have
already
concentrated
around
themselves
a
goodly
*NL*
proportion
of
the
populace
scattered
on
the
Place
,
who
condemn
*NL*
themselves
to
immobility
and
fatigue
in
the
hope
of
a
small
execution
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
reader
,
after
having
contemplated
this
lively
and
noisy
scene
*NL*
which
is
being
enacted
in
all
parts
of
the
Place
,
will
now
transfer
*NL*
his
gaze
towards
that
ancient
demi-Gothic
,
demi-Romanesque
house
of
the
*NL*
Tour-Roland
,
which
forms
the
corner
on
the
quay
to
the
west
,
he
will
*NL*
observe
,
at
the
angle
of
the
facade
,
a
large
public
breviary
,
with
rich
*NL*
illuminations
,
protected
from
the
rain
by
a
little
penthouse
,
and
from
*NL*
thieves
by
a
small
grating
,
which
,
however
,
permits
of
the
leaves
being
*NL*
turned
.
Beside
this
breviary
is
a
narrow
,
arched
window
,
closed
by
two
*NL*
iron
bars
in
the
form
of
a
cross
,
and
looking
on
the
square
;
the
only
*NL*
opening
which
admits
a
small
quantity
of
light
and
air
to
a
little
cell
*NL*
without
a
door
,
constructed
on
the
ground-floor
,
in
the
thickness
of
the
*NL*
walls
of
the
old
house
,
and
filled
with
a
peace
all
the
more
profound
,
*NL*
with
a
silence
all
the
more
gloomy
,
because
a
public
place
,
the
most
*NL*
populous
and
most
noisy
in
Paris
swarms
and
shrieks
around
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
little
cell
had
been
celebrated
in
Paris
for
nearly
three
*NL*
centuries
,
ever
since
Madame
Rolande
de
la
Tour-Roland
,
in
mourning
for
*NL*
her
father
who
died
in
the
Crusades
,
had
caused
it
to
be
hollowed
out
*NL*
in
the
wall
of
her
own
house
,
in
order
to
immure
herself
there
forever
,
*NL*
keeping
of
all
her
palace
only
this
lodging
whose
door
was
walled
up
,
*NL*
and
whose
window
stood
open
,
winter
and
summer
,
giving
all
the
rest
to
*NL*
the
poor
and
to
God
.
The
afflicted
damsel
had
,
in
fact
,
waited
twenty
*NL*
years
for
death
in
this
premature
tomb
,
praying
night
and
day
for
*NL*
the
soul
of
her
father
,
sleeping
in
ashes
,
without
even
a
stone
for
a
*NL*
pillow
,
clothed
in
a
black
sack
,
and
subsisting
on
the
bread
and
water
*NL*
which
the
compassion
of
the
passers-by
led
them
to
deposit
on
the
ledge
*NL*
of
her
window
,
thus
receiving
charity
after
having
bestowed
it
.
At
her
*NL*
death
,
at
the
moment
when
she
was
passing
to
the
other
sepulchre
,
she
*NL*
had
bequeathed
this
one
in
perpetuity
to
afflicted
women
,
mothers
,
*NL*
widows
,
or
maidens
,
who
should
wish
to
pray
much
for
others
or
for
*NL*
themselves
,
and
who
should
desire
to
inter
themselves
alive
in
a
great
*NL*
grief
or
a
great
penance
.
The
poor
of
her
day
had
made
her
a
fine
*NL*
funeral
,
with
tears
and
benedictions
;
but
,
to
their
great
regret
,
the
*NL*
pious
maid
had
not
been
canonized
,
for
lack
of
influence
.
Those
among
*NL*
them
who
were
a
little
inclined
to
impiety
,
had
hoped
that
the
matter
*NL*
might
be
accomplished
in
Paradise
more
easily
than
at
Rome
,
and
had
*NL*
frankly
besought
God
,
instead
of
the
pope
,
in
behalf
of
the
deceased
.
*NL*
The
majority
had
contented
themselves
with
holding
the
memory
of
Rolande
*NL*
sacred
,
and
converting
her
rags
into
relics
.
The
city
,
on
its
side
,
had
*NL*
founded
in
honor
of
the
damoiselle
,
a
public
breviary
,
which
had
been
*NL*
fastened
near
the
window
of
the
cell
,
in
order
that
passers-by
might
*NL*
halt
there
from
time
to
time
,
were
it
only
to
pray
;
that
prayer
might
*NL*
remind
them
of
alms
,
and
that
the
poor
recluses
,
heiresses
of
Madame
*NL*
Rolande
's
vault
,
might
not
die
outright
of
hunger
and
forgetfulness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
this
sort
of
tomb
was
not
so
very
rare
a
thing
in
the
cities
*NL*
of
the
Middle
Ages
.
One
often
encountered
in
the
most
frequented
street
,
*NL*
in
the
most
crowded
and
noisy
market
,
in
the
very
middle
,
under
the
feet
*NL*
of
the
horses
,
under
the
wheels
of
the
carts
,
as
it
were
,
a
cellar
,
a
*NL*
well
,
a
tiny
walled
and
grated
cabin
,
at
the
bottom
of
which
a
human
*NL*
being
prayed
night
and
day
,
voluntarily
devoted
to
some
eternal
*NL*
lamentation
,
to
some
great
expiation
.
And
all
the
reflections
which
that
*NL*
strange
spectacle
would
awaken
in
us
to-day
;
that
horrible
cell
,
a
sort
*NL*
of
intermediary
link
between
a
house
and
the
tomb
,
the
cemetery
and
*NL*
the
city
;
that
living
being
cut
off
from
the
human
community
,
and
*NL*
thenceforth
reckoned
among
the
dead
;
that
lamp
consuming
its
last
drop
*NL*
of
oil
in
the
darkness
;
that
remnant
of
life
flickering
in
the
grave
;
*NL*
that
breath
,
that
voice
,
that
eternal
prayer
in
a
box
of
stone
;
*NL*
that
face
forever
turned
towards
the
other
world
;
that
eye
already
*NL*
illuminated
with
another
sun
;
that
ear
pressed
to
the
walls
of
a
tomb
;
*NL*
that
soul
a
prisoner
in
that
body
;
that
body
a
prisoner
in
that
dungeon
*NL*
cell
,
and
beneath
that
double
envelope
of
flesh
and
granite
,
the
murmur
*NL*
of
that
soul
in
pain
;
--
nothing
of
all
this
was
perceived
by
the
crowd
.
*NL*
The
piety
of
that
age
,
not
very
subtle
nor
much
given
to
reasoning
,
did
*NL*
not
see
so
many
facets
in
an
act
of
religion
.
It
took
the
thing
in
the
*NL*
block
,
honored
,
venerated
,
hallowed
the
sacrifice
at
need
,
but
did
not
*NL*
analyze
the
sufferings
,
and
felt
but
moderate
pity
for
them
.
It
brought
*NL*
some
pittance
to
the
miserable
penitent
from
time
to
time
,
looked
*NL*
through
the
hole
to
see
whether
he
were
still
living
,
forgot
his
name
,
*NL*
hardly
knew
how
many
years
ago
he
had
begun
to
die
,
and
to
the
stranger
,
*NL*
who
questioned
them
about
the
living
skeleton
who
was
perishing
in
that
*NL*
cellar
,
the
neighbors
replied
simply
,
``
It
is
the
recluse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
was
then
viewed
without
metaphysics
,
without
exaggeration
,
*NL*
without
magnifying
glass
,
with
the
naked
eye
.
The
microscope
had
not
yet
*NL*
been
invented
,
either
for
things
of
matter
or
for
things
of
the
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
although
people
were
but
little
surprised
by
it
,
the
examples
*NL*
of
this
sort
of
cloistration
in
the
hearts
of
cities
were
in
truth
*NL*
frequent
,
as
we
have
just
said
.
There
were
in
Paris
a
considerable
*NL*
number
of
these
cells
,
for
praying
to
God
and
doing
penance
;
they
were
*NL*
nearly
all
occupied
.
It
is
true
that
the
clergy
did
not
like
to
have
*NL*
them
empty
,
since
that
implied
lukewarmness
in
believers
,
and
that
*NL*
lepers
were
put
into
them
when
there
were
no
penitents
on
hand
.
Besides
*NL*
the
cell
on
the
Greve
,
there
was
one
at
Montfaucon
,
one
at
the
Charnier
*NL*
des
Innocents
,
another
I
hardly
know
where
,
--
at
the
Clichon
House
,
I
*NL*
think
;
others
still
at
many
spots
where
traces
of
them
are
found
in
*NL*
traditions
,
in
default
of
memorials
.
The
University
had
also
its
own
.
On
*NL*
Mount
Sainte-Genevieve
a
sort
of
Job
of
the
Middle
Ages
,
for
the
space
*NL*
of
thirty
years
,
chanted
the
seven
penitential
psalms
on
a
dunghill
at
*NL*
the
bottom
of
a
cistern
,
beginning
anew
when
he
had
finished
,
singing
*NL*
loudest
at
night
,
_
magna
voce
per
umbras
_
,
and
to-day
,
the
*NL*
antiquary
fancies
that
he
hears
his
voice
as
he
enters
the
Rue
du
*NL*
Puits-qui-parle
--
the
street
of
the
``
Speaking
Well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
confine
ourselves
to
the
cell
in
the
Tour-Roland
,
we
must
say
that
*NL*
it
had
never
lacked
recluses
.
After
the
death
of
Madame
Roland
,
it
*NL*
had
stood
vacant
for
a
year
or
two
,
though
rarely
.
Many
women
had
come
*NL*
thither
to
mourn
,
until
their
death
,
for
relatives
,
lovers
,
faults
.
*NL*
Parisian
malice
,
which
thrusts
its
finger
into
everything
,
even
into
*NL*
things
which
concern
it
the
least
,
affirmed
that
it
had
beheld
but
few
*NL*
widows
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
accordance
with
the
fashion
of
the
epoch
,
a
Latin
inscription
on
the
*NL*
wall
indicated
to
the
learned
passer-by
the
pious
purpose
of
this
cell
.
*NL*
The
custom
was
retained
until
the
middle
of
the
sixteenth
century
of
*NL*
explaining
an
edifice
by
a
brief
device
inscribed
above
the
door
.
*NL*
Thus
,
one
still
reads
in
France
,
above
the
wicket
of
the
prison
in
the
*NL*
seignorial
mansion
of
Tourville
,
_
Sileto
et
spera
_
;
in
Ireland
,
beneath
*NL*
the
armorial
bearings
which
surmount
the
grand
door
to
Fortescue
Castle
,
*NL*
_
Forte
scutum
,
salus
ducum
_
;
in
England
,
over
the
principal
entrance
*NL*
to
the
hospitable
mansion
of
the
Earls
Cowper
:
_
Tuum
est
_
.
At
that
time
*NL*
every
edifice
was
a
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
there
was
no
door
to
the
walled
cell
of
the
Tour-Roland
,
these
two
*NL*
words
had
been
carved
in
large
Roman
capitals
over
the
window
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
TU
,
ORA
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
And
this
caused
the
people
,
whose
good
sense
does
not
perceive
so
much
*NL*
refinement
in
things
,
and
likes
to
translate
_
Ludovico
Magno
_
by
``
Porte
*NL*
Saint-Denis
,
''
to
give
to
this
dark
,
gloomy
,
damp
cavity
,
the
name
of
*NL*
``
The
Rat-Hole
.
''
An
explanation
less
sublime
,
perhaps
,
than
the
other
;
*NL*
but
,
on
the
other
hand
,
more
picturesque
.

CHAPTER
III
.
HISTORY
OF
A
LEAVENED
CAKE
OF
MAIZE
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
epoch
of
this
history
,
the
cell
in
the
Tour-Roland
was
occupied
.
*NL*
If
the
reader
desires
to
know
by
whom
,
he
has
only
to
lend
an
ear
to
the
*NL*
conversation
of
three
worthy
gossips
,
who
,
at
the
moment
when
we
have
*NL*
directed
his
attention
to
the
Rat-Hole
,
were
directing
their
steps
*NL*
towards
the
same
spot
,
coming
up
along
the
water
's
edge
from
the
*NL*
Chatelet
,
towards
the
Greve
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
of
these
women
were
dressed
like
good
_
bourgeoises
_
of
Paris
.
Their
*NL*
fine
white
ruffs
;
their
petticoats
of
linsey-woolsey
,
striped
red
and
*NL*
blue
;
their
white
knitted
stockings
,
with
clocks
embroidered
in
colors
,
*NL*
well
drawn
upon
their
legs
;
the
square-toed
shoes
of
tawny
leather
with
*NL*
black
soles
,
and
,
above
all
,
their
headgear
,
that
sort
of
tinsel
horn
,
*NL*
loaded
down
with
ribbons
and
laces
,
which
the
women
of
Champagne
still
*NL*
wear
,
in
company
with
the
grenadiers
of
the
imperial
guard
of
Russia
,
*NL*
announced
that
they
belonged
to
that
class
wives
which
holds
the
middle
*NL*
ground
between
what
the
lackeys
call
a
woman
and
what
they
term
a
lady
.
*NL*
They
wore
neither
rings
nor
gold
crosses
,
and
it
was
easy
to
see
that
,
*NL*
in
their
ease
,
this
did
not
proceed
from
poverty
,
but
simply
from
*NL*
fear
of
being
fined
.
Their
companion
was
attired
in
very
much
the
same
*NL*
manner
;
but
there
was
that
indescribable
something
about
her
dress
and
*NL*
bearing
which
suggested
the
wife
of
a
provincial
notary
.
One
could
see
,
*NL*
by
the
way
in
which
her
girdle
rose
above
her
hips
,
that
she
had
not
*NL*
been
long
in
Paris
.
--
Add
to
this
a
plaited
tucker
,
knots
of
ribbon
*NL*
on
her
shoes
--
and
that
the
stripes
of
her
petticoat
ran
horizontally
*NL*
instead
of
vertically
,
and
a
thousand
other
enormities
which
shocked
*NL*
good
taste
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
first
walked
with
that
step
peculiar
to
Parisian
ladies
,
showing
*NL*
Paris
to
women
from
the
country
.
The
provincial
held
by
the
hand
a
big
*NL*
boy
,
who
held
in
his
a
large
,
flat
cake
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
regret
to
be
obliged
to
add
,
that
,
owing
to
the
rigor
of
the
season
,
*NL*
he
was
using
his
tongue
as
a
handkerchief
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
was
making
them
drag
him
along
,
_
non
passibus
Cequis
_
,
as
*NL*
Virgil
says
,
and
stumbling
at
every
moment
,
to
the
great
indignation
of
*NL*
his
mother
.
It
is
true
that
he
was
looking
at
his
cake
more
than
at
the
*NL*
pavement
.
Some
serious
motive
,
no
doubt
,
prevented
his
biting
it
-LRB-
the
*NL*
cake
-RRB-
,
for
he
contented
himself
with
gazing
tenderly
at
it
.
But
the
*NL*
mother
should
have
rather
taken
charge
of
the
cake
.
It
was
cruel
to
make
*NL*
a
Tantalus
of
the
chubby-checked
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
the
three
demoiselles
-LRB-
for
the
name
of
dames
was
then
*NL*
reserved
for
noble
women
-RRB-
were
all
talking
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
make
haste
,
Demoiselle
Mahiette
,
''
said
the
youngest
of
the
*NL*
three
,
who
was
also
the
largest
,
to
the
provincial
,
``
I
greatly
fear
that
*NL*
we
shall
arrive
too
late
;
they
told
us
at
the
Chatelet
that
they
were
*NL*
going
to
take
him
directly
to
the
pillory
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
bah
!
what
are
you
saying
,
Demoiselle
Oudarde
Musnier
?
''
interposed
*NL*
the
other
Parisienne
.
``
There
are
two
hours
yet
to
the
pillory
.
We
have
*NL*
time
enough
.
Have
you
ever
seen
any
one
pilloried
,
my
dear
Mahiette
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
the
provincial
,
``
at
Reims
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
bah
!
What
is
your
pillory
at
Reims
?
A
miserable
cage
into
which
*NL*
only
peasants
are
turned
.
A
great
affair
,
truly
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
peasants
!
''
said
Mahiette
,
``
at
the
cloth
market
in
Reims
!
We
have
*NL*
seen
very
fine
criminals
there
,
who
have
killed
their
father
and
mother
!
*NL*
Peasants
!
For
what
do
you
take
us
,
Gervaise
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
certain
that
the
provincial
was
on
the
point
of
taking
offence
,
*NL*
for
the
honor
of
her
pillory
.
Fortunately
,
that
discreet
damoiselle
,
*NL*
Oudarde
Musnier
,
turned
the
conversation
in
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
way
,
Damoiselle
Mahiette
,
what
say
you
to
our
Flemish
*NL*
Ambassadors
?
Have
you
as
fine
ones
at
Reims
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
admit
,
''
replied
Mahiette
,
``
that
it
is
only
in
Paris
that
such
*NL*
Flemings
can
be
seen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
see
among
the
embassy
,
that
big
ambassador
who
is
a
hosier
?
''
*NL*
asked
Oudarde
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Mahiette
.
``
He
has
the
eye
of
a
Saturn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
big
fellow
whose
face
resembles
a
bare
belly
?
''
resumed
*NL*
Gervaise
.
``
And
the
little
one
,
with
small
eyes
framed
in
red
eyelids
,
*NL*
pared
down
and
slashed
up
like
a
thistle
head
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
their
horses
that
are
worth
seeing
,
''
said
Oudarde
,
``
caparisoned
as
*NL*
they
are
after
the
fashion
of
their
country
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
my
dear
,
''
interrupted
provincial
Mahiette
,
assuming
in
her
turn
an
*NL*
air
of
superiority
,
``
what
would
you
say
then
,
if
you
had
seen
in
'
61
,
at
*NL*
the
consecration
at
Reims
,
eighteen
years
ago
,
the
horses
of
the
princes
*NL*
and
of
the
king
's
company

Housings
and
caparisons
of
all
sorts
;
some
*NL*
of
damask
cloth

of
fine
cloth

gold

furred

what
money
that
had
cost
!
And
*NL*
what
handsome
boy
pages
rode
upon
them
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
,
''
replied
Oudarde
dryly
,
``
does
not
prevent
the
Flemings
having
*NL*
very
fine
horses

had
a
superb

proceeded

Mahiette

exclaimed

shook
her

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
singular
point
is
,

observed
Oudarde
,
``
that
_
la
sachette

has
the

same
idea
about
the
Egyptian

What

*NL*
``
And
who
is
Sister

persisted
Mahiette

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

``
that
poor
woman

are
carrying
this

*NL*
*NL*
Oudarde
nodded
affirmatively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Precisely
.
You
will
see
her
presently
at
her
window
on
the
Greve

She
*NL*
has
the
same
opinion
as
yourself
of
these
vagabonds
of
Egypt
,
who
play
*NL*
the
tambourine
and
tell
fortunes
to
the
public
.
No
one
knows
whence
*NL*
comes
her
horror
of
the
gypsies
and
Egyptians
.
But
you
,
Mahiette
--
why
do
*NL*
you
run
so
at
the
mere
sight
of
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
said
Mahiette
,
seizing
her
child
's
round
head
in
both
hands
,
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
that
to
happen
to
me
which
happened
to
Paquette
la
*NL*
Chantefleurie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
you
must
tell
us
that
story
,
my
good
Mahiette

''
said
Gervaise
,
*NL*
taking
her
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gladly
,
''
replied
Mahiette
,
``
but
you
must
be
ignorant
of
all
but
your
*NL*
Paris
not
to
know
that
!
I
will
tell
you
then
-LRB-
but
't
is
not
necessary
for
*NL*
us
to
halt
that
I
may
tell
you
the
tale
-RRB-
,
that
Paquette
la
Chantefleurie
*NL*
was
a
pretty
maid
of
eighteen
when
I
was
one
myself
,
that
is
to
say
,
*NL*
eighteen
years
ago
,
and
't
is
her
own
fault
if
she
is
not
to-day
,
like
*NL*
me
,
a
good
,
plump
,
fresh
mother
of
six
and
thirty
,
with
a
husband
and
a
*NL*
son
.
However
,
after
the
age
of
fourteen
,
it
was
too
late
!
Well
,
she
was
*NL*
the
daughter
of
Guybertant
,
minstrel
of
the
barges
at
Reims
,
the
same
*NL*
who
had
played
before
King
Charles
VII.
,
at
his
coronation
,
when
he
*NL*
descended
our
river
Vesle
from
Sillery
to
Muison
,
when
Madame
the
Maid
*NL*
of
Orleans
was
also
in
the
boat
.
The
old
father
died
when
Paquette
was
*NL*
still
a
mere
child
;
she
had
then
no
one
but
her
mother
,
the
sister
of
*NL*
M.
Pradon
,
master-brazier
and
coppersmith
in
Paris
,
Rue
Farm-Garlin
,
who
*NL*
died
last
year
.
You
see
she
was
of
good
family
.
The
mother
was
a
good
*NL*
simple
woman
,
unfortunately
,
and
she
taught
Paquette
nothing
but
a
bit
*NL*
of
embroidery
and
toy-making
which
did
not
prevent
the
little
one
from
*NL*
growing
very
large
and
remaining
very
poor
.
They
both
dwelt
at
Reims
,
*NL*
on
the
river
front
,
Rue
de
Folle-Peine
.
Mark
this
:
For
I
believe
it
*NL*
was
this
which
brought
misfortune
to
Paquette
.
In
'
61
,
the
year
of
the
*NL*
coronation
of
our
King
Louis
XI
.
whom
God
preserve
!
Paquette
was
so
gay
*NL*
and
so
pretty
that
she
was
called
everywhere
by
no
other
name
than
``
la
*NL*
Chantefleurie
''
--
blossoming
song
.
Poor
girl
!
She
had
handsome
teeth
,
she
*NL*
was
fond
of
laughing
and
displaying
them
.
Now
,
a
maid
who
loves
to
laugh
*NL*
is
on
the
road
to
weeping
;
handsome
teeth
ruin
handsome
eyes
.
So
she
was
*NL*
la
Chantefleurie
.
She
and
her
mother
earned
a
precarious
living
;
*NL*
they
had
been
very
destitute
since
the
death
of
the
minstrel
;
their
*NL*
embroidery
did
not
bring
them
in
more
than
six
farthings
a
week
,
which
*NL*
does
not
amount
to
quite
two
eagle
liards
.
Where
were
the
days
*NL*
when
Father
Guybertant
had
earned
twelve
sous
parisian
,
in
a
single
*NL*
coronation
,
with
a
song
?
One
winter
-LRB-
it
was
in
that
same
year
of
'
61
-RRB-
,
*NL*
when
the
two
women
had
neither
fagots
nor
firewood
,
it
was
very
cold
,
*NL*
which
gave
la
Chantefleurie
such
a
fine
color
that
the
men
called
*NL*
her
Paquette
!
*
and
many
called
her
Paquerette
!
**
and
she
was
*NL*
ruined
.
--
Eustache
,
just
let
me
see
you
bite
that
cake
if
you
dare
!
--
We
*NL*
immediately
perceived
that
she
was
ruined
,
one
Sunday
when
she
came
to
*NL*
church
with
a
gold
cross
about
her
neck
.
At
fourteen
years
of
age
!
do
*NL*
you
see
?
First
it
was
the
young
Vicomte
de
Cormontreuil
,
who
has
his
*NL*
bell
tower
three
leagues
distant
from
Reims
;
then
Messire
Henri
*NL*
de
Triancourt
,
equerry
to
the
King
;
then
less
than
that
,
Chiart
de
*NL*
Beaulion
,
sergeant-at-arms
;
then
,
still
descending
,
Guery
Aubergeon
,
*NL*
carver
to
the
King
;
then
,
Mace
de
Frepus
,
barber
to
monsieur
the
*NL*
dauphin
;
then
,
Thevenin
le
Moine
,
King
's
cook
;
then
,
the
men
growing
*NL*
continually
younger
and
less
noble
,
she
fell
to
Guillaume
Racine
,
*NL*
minstrel
of
the
hurdy
gurdy
and
to
Thierry
de
Mer
,
lamplighter
.
Then
,
*NL*
poor
Chantefleurie
,
she
belonged
to
every
one
:
she
had
reached
the
last
*NL*
sou
of
her
gold
piece
.
What
shall
I
say
to
you
,
my
damoiselles
?
At
the
*NL*
coronation
,
in
the
same
year
,
'
61
,
't
was
she
who
made
the
bed
of
the
*NL*
king
of
the
debauchees
!
In
the
same
year

away

trickled
from

*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is

In
'
66
,
`
twill
*NL*
be
sixteen
years
ago
this
month
,
at
Sainte-Paule
's
day
,
Paquette
was
*NL*
brought
to
bed
of
a
little
girl
.
The
unhappy
creature
!
it
was
a
great
*NL*
joy
to
her
;
she
had
long
wished
for
a
child
.
Her
mother
,
good
woman
,
who
*NL*
had
never
known
what
to
do
except
to
shut
her
eyes
,
her
mother
was
dead
.
*NL*
Paquette
had
no
longer
any
one
to
love
in
the
world
or
any
one
to
love
*NL*
her
.
La
Chantefleurie
had
been
a
poor
creature
during
the
five
years
*NL*
since
her
fall
.
She
was
alone
,
alone
in
this
life
,
fingers
were
pointed
*NL*
at
her
,
she
was
hooted
at
in
the
streets
,
beaten
by
the
sergeants
,
*NL*
jeered
at
by
the
little
boys
in
rags
.
And
then
,
twenty
had
arrived
:
and
*NL*
twenty
is
an
old
age
for
amorous
women
.
Folly
began
to
bring
her
in
no
*NL*
more
than
her
trade
of
embroidery
in
former
days
;
for
every
wrinkle
that
*NL*
came
,
a
crown
fled
;
winter
became
hard
to
her
once
more
,
wood
became
*NL*
rare
again
in
her
brazier
,
and
bread
in
her
cupboard
.
She
could
no
*NL*
longer
work
because
,
in
becoming
voluptuous
,
she
had
grown
lazy
;
and
she
*NL*
suffered
much
more
because
,
in
growing
lazy
,
she
had
become
voluptuous
.
*NL*
At
least
,
that
is
the
way
in
which
monsieur
the
cure
of
Saint-Remy
*NL*
explains
why
these
women
are
colder
and
hungrier
than
other
poor
women
,
*NL*
when
they
are
old
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
remarked
Gervaise
,
``
but
the
gypsies
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
moment
,
Gervaise
!
''
said
Oudarde
,
whose
attention
was
less
*NL*
impatient
.
``
What
would
be
left
for
the
end
if
all
were
in
the
beginning
?
*NL*
Continue
,
Mahiette
,
I
entreat
you
.
That
poor
Chantefleurie
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mahiette
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
she
was
very
sad
,
very
miserable
,
and
furrowed
her
cheeks
with
*NL*
tears
.
But
in
the
midst
of
her
shame
,
her
folly
,
her
debauchery
,
*NL*
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
should
be
less
wild
,
less
shameful
,
less
*NL*
dissipated
,
if
there
were
something
or
some
one
in
the
world
whom
she
*NL*
could
love
,
and
who
could
love
her
.
It
was
necessary
that
it
should
be
a
*NL*
child
,
because
only
a
child
could
be
sufficiently
innocent
for
that
.
She
*NL*
had
recognized
this
fact
after
having
tried
to
love
a
thief
,
the
only
*NL*
man
who
wanted
her
;
but
after
a
short
time
,
she
perceived
that
the
thief
*NL*
despised
her
.
Those
women
of
love
require
either
a
lover
or
a
child
to
*NL*
fill
their
hearts
.
Otherwise
,
they
are
very
unhappy
.
As
she
could
not
*NL*
have
a
lover
,
she
turned
wholly
towards
a
desire
for
a
child
,
and
as
she
*NL*
had
not
ceased
to
be
pious
,
she
made
her
constant
prayer
to
the
good
*NL*
God
for
it
.
So
the
good
God
took
pity
on
her
,
and
gave
her
a
little
*NL*
daughter
.
I
will
not
speak
to
you
of
her
joy
;
it
was
a
fury
of
*NL*
tears
,
and
caresses
,
and
kisses
.
She
nursed
her
child
herself
,
made
*NL*
swaddling-bands
for
it
out
of
her
coverlet
,
the
only
one
which
she
*NL*
had
on
her
bed
,
and
no
longer
felt
either
cold
or
hunger
.
She
became
*NL*
beautiful
once
more
,
in
consequence
of
it
.
An
old
maid
makes
a
*NL*
young
mother
.
Gallantry
claimed
her
once
more
;
men
came
to
see
la
*NL*
Chantefleurie
;
she
found
customers
again
for
her
merchandise
,
and
out
*NL*
of
all
these
horrors
she
made
baby
clothes
,
caps
and
bibs
,
bodices
*NL*
with
shoulder-straps
of
lace
,
and
tiny
bonnets
of
satin
,
without
even
*NL*
thinking
of
buying
herself
another
coverlet
.
--
Master
Eustache
,
I
have
*NL*
already
told
you
not
to
eat
that
cake
.
--
It
is
certain
that
little
Agnes
,
*NL*
that
was
the
child
's
name
,
a
baptismal
name
,
for
it
was
a
long
time
*NL*
since
la
Chantefleurie
had
had
any
surname
--
it
is
certain
that
*NL*
that
little
one
was
more
swathed
in
ribbons
and
embroideries
than
a
*NL*
dauphiness
of
Dauphiny
!
Among
other
things
,
she
had
a
pair
of
little
*NL*
shoes
,
the
like
of
which
King
Louis
XI
.
certainly
never
had
!
Her
mother
*NL*
had
stitched
and
embroidered
them
herself
;
she
had
lavished
on
them
all
*NL*
the
delicacies
of
her
art
of
embroideress
,
and
all
the
embellishments
of
*NL*
a
robe
for
the
good
Virgin
.
They
certainly
were
the
two
prettiest
little
*NL*
pink
shoes
that
could
be
seen
.
They
were
no
longer
than
my
thumb
,
and
*NL*
one
had
to
see
the
child
's
little
feet
come
out
of
them
,
in
order
to
*NL*
believe
that
they
had
been
able
to
get
into
them
.
'T
is
true
that
those
*NL*
little
feet
were
so
small
,
so
pretty
,
so
rosy
!
rosier
than
the
satin
of
*NL*
the
shoes
!
When
you
have
children
,
Oudarde
,
you
will
find
that
there
is
*NL*
nothing
prettier
than
those
little
hands
and
feet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ask
no
better
,
''
said
Oudarde
with
a
sigh
,
``
but
I
am
waiting
until
it
*NL*
shall
suit
the
good
pleasure
of
M.
Andry
Musnier
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
However
,
Paquette
's
child
had
more
that
was
pretty
about
it
besides
its
*NL*
feet
.
I
saw
her
when
she
was
only
four
months
old
;
she
was
a
love
!
She
*NL*
had
eyes
larger
than
her
mouth
,
and
the
most
charming
black
hair
,
which
*NL*
already
curled
.
She
would
have
been
a
magnificent
brunette
at
the
age
*NL*
of
sixteen
!
Her
mother
became
more
crazy
over
her
every
day
.
She
kissed
*NL*
her
,
caressed
her
,
tickled
her
,
washed
her
,
decked
her
out
,
devoured
*NL*
her
!
She
lost
her
head
over
her
,
she
thanked
God
for
her
.
Her
pretty
,
*NL*
little
rosy
feet
above
all
were
an
endless
source
of
wonderment
,
they
*NL*
were
a
delirium
of
joy
!
She
was
always
pressing
her
lips
to
them
,
and
*NL*
she
could
never
recover
from
her
amazement
at
their
smallness
.
She
put
*NL*
them
into
the
tiny
shoes
,
took
them
out
,
admired
them
,
marvelled
at
*NL*
them
,
looked
at
the
light
through
them
,
was
curious
to
see
them
try
to
*NL*
walk
on
her
bed
,
and
would
gladly
have
passed
her
life
on
her
knees
,
*NL*
putting
on
and
taking
off
the
shoes
from
those
feet
,
as
though
they
had
*NL*
been
those
of
an
Infant
Jesus
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
tale
is
fair
and
good
,
''
said
Gervaise
in
a
low
tone
;
``
but
where
do
*NL*
gypsies
come
into
all
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
''
replied
Mahiette
.
``
One
day
there
arrived
in
Reims
a
very
queer
*NL*
sort
of
people
.
They
were
beggars
and
vagabonds
who
were
roaming
over
*NL*
the
country
,
led
by
their
duke
and
their
counts
.
They
were
browned
by
*NL*
exposure
to
the
sun
,
they
had
closely
curling
hair
,
and
silver
rings
in
*NL*
their
ears
.
The
women
were
still
uglier
than
the
men
.
They
had
blacker
*NL*
faces
,
which
were
always
uncovered
,
a
miserable
frock
on
their
bodies
,
*NL*
an
old
cloth
woven
of
cords
bound
upon
their
shoulder
,
and
their
hair
*NL*
hanging
like
the
tail
of
a
horse
.
The
children
who
scrambled
*NL*
between
their
legs
would
have
frightened
as
many
monkeys
.
A
band
of
*NL*
excommunicates
.
All
these
persons
came
direct
from
lower
Egypt
to
*NL*
Reims
through
Poland
.
The
Pope
had
confessed
them
,
it
was
said
,
and
had
*NL*
prescribed
to
them
as
penance
to
roam
through
the
world
for
seven
years
,
*NL*
without
sleeping
in
a
bed
;
and
so
they
were
called
penancers
,
and
smelt
*NL*
horribly
.
It
appears
that
they
had
formerly
been
Saracens
,
which
was
*NL*
why
they
believed
in
Jupiter
,
and
claimed
ten
livres
of
Tournay
from
all
*NL*
archbishops
,
bishops
,
and
mitred
abbots
with
croziers
.
A
bull
from
the
*NL*
Pope
empowered
them
to
do
that
.
They
came
to
Reims
to
tell
fortunes
in
*NL*
the
name
of
the
King
of
Algiers
,
and
the
Emperor
of
Germany
.
You
can
*NL*
readily
imagine
that
no
more
was
needed
to
cause
the
entrance
to
the
*NL*
town
to
be
forbidden
them
.
Then
the
whole
band
camped
with
good
grace
*NL*
outside
the
gate
of
Braine
,
on
that
hill
where
stands
a
mill
,
beside
the
*NL*
cavities
of
the
ancient
chalk
pits
.
And
everybody
in
Reims
vied
with
his
*NL*
neighbor
in
going
to
see
them
.
They
looked
at
your
hand
,
and
told
you
*NL*
marvellous
prophecies
;
they
were
equal
to
predicting
to
Judas
that
he
*NL*
would
become
Pope
.
Nevertheless
,
ugly
rumors
were
in
circulation
in
*NL*
regard
to
them
;
about
children
stolen
,
purses
cut
,
and
human
flesh
*NL*
devoured
.
The
wise
people
said
to
the
foolish
:
``
Do
n't
go
there
!
''
and
*NL*
then
went
themselves
on
the
sly
.
It
was
an
infatuation
.
The
fact
is
,
*NL*
that
they
said
things
fit
to
astonish
a
cardinal
.
Mothers
triumphed
*NL*
greatly
over
their
little
ones
after
the
Egyptians
had
read
in
their
*NL*
hands
all
sorts
of
marvels
written
in
pagan
and
in
Turkish
.
One
had
an
*NL*
emperor
;
another
,
a
pope
;
another
,
a
captain
.
Poor
Chantefleurie
was
*NL*
seized
with
curiosity
;
she
wished
to
know
about
herself
,
and
whether
*NL*
her
pretty
little
Agnes
would
not
become
some
day
Empress
of
Armenia
,
*NL*
or
something
else
.
So
she
carried
her
to
the
Egyptians
;
and
the
Egyptian
*NL*
women
fell
to
admiring
the
child
,
and
to
caressing
it
,
and
to
kissing
it
*NL*
with
their
black
mouths
,
and
to
marvelling
over
its
little
band
,
alas
!
*NL*
to
the
great
joy
of
the
mother
.
They
were
especially
enthusiastic
over
*NL*
her
pretty
feet
and
shoes
.
The
child
was
not
yet
a
year
old
.
She
already
*NL*
lisped
a
little
,
laughed
at
her
mother
like
a
little
mad
thing
,
was
*NL*
plump
and
quite
round
,
and
possessed
a
thousand
charming
little
gestures
*NL*
of
the
angels
of
paradise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
was
very
much
frightened
by
the
Egyptians
,
and
wept
.
But
her
mother
*NL*
kissed
her
more
warmly
and
went
away
enchanted
with
the
good
fortune
*NL*
which
the
soothsayers
had
foretold
for
her
Agnes
.
She
was
to
be
a
*NL*
beauty
,
virtuous
,
a
queen
.
So
she
returned
to
her
attic
in
the
Rue
*NL*
Folle-Peine
,
very
proud
of
bearing
with
her
a
queen
.
The
next
day
she
*NL*
took
advantage
of
a
moment
when
the
child
was
asleep
on
her
bed
,
-LRB-
for
*NL*
they
always
slept
together
-RRB-
,
gently
left
the
door
a
little
way
open
,
and
*NL*
ran
to
tell
a
neighbor
in
the
Rue
de
la
Sechesserie
,
that
the
day
would
*NL*
come
when
her
daughter
Agnes
would
be
served
at
table
by
the
King
of
*NL*
England
and
the
Archduke
of
Ethiopia
,
and
a
hundred
other
marvels
.
On
*NL*
her
return
,
hearing
no
cries
on
the
staircase
,
she
said
to
herself
:
*NL*
`
Good
!
the
child
is
still
asleep
!
'
She
found
her
door
wider
open
than
*NL*
she
had
left
it
,
but
she
entered
,
poor
mother
,
and
ran
to
the
bed
.
--
The
*NL*
child
was
no
longer
there
,
the
place
was
empty
.
Nothing
remained
of
the
*NL*
child
,
but
one
of
her
pretty
little
shoes
.
She
flew
out
of
the
room
,
*NL*
dashed
down
the
stairs
,
and
began
to
beat
her
head
against
the
wall
,
*NL*
crying
:
`
My
child
!
who
has
my
child
?
Who
has
taken
my
child
?
'
The
street
*NL*
was
deserted
,
the
house
isolated
;
no
one
could
tell
her
anything
about
*NL*
it
.
She
went
about
the
town
,
searched
all
the
streets
,
ran
hither
and
*NL*
thither
the
whole
day
long
,
wild
,
beside
herself
,
terrible
,
snuffing
at
*NL*
doors
and
windows
like
a
wild
beast
which
has
lost
its
young
.
She
was
*NL*
breathless
,
dishevelled
,
frightful
to
see
,
and
there
was
a
fire
in
her
*NL*
eyes
which
dried
her
tears
.
She
stopped
the
passers-by
and
cried
:
`
My
*NL*
daughter
!
my
daughter
!
my
pretty
little
daughter
!
If
any
one
will
give
*NL*
me
back
my
daughter
,
I
will
be
his
servant
,
the
servant
of
his
dog
,
and
*NL*
he
shall
eat
my
heart
if
he
will
.
'
She
met
M.
le
Cure
of
Saint-Remy
,
and
*NL*
said
to
him
:
`
Monsieur
,
I
will
till
the
earth
with
my
finger-nails
,
but
*NL*
give
me
back
my
child
!
'
It
was
heartrending
,
Oudarde
;
and
IL
saw
a
very
*NL*
hard
man
,
Master
Ponce
Lacabre
,
the
procurator
,
weep
.
Ah
!
poor
mother
!
*NL*
In
the
evening
she
returned
home
.
During
her
absence
,
a
neighbor
had
*NL*
seen
two
gypsies
ascend
up
to
it
with
a
bundle
in
their
arms
,
then
*NL*
descend
again
,
after
closing
the
door
.
After
their
departure
,
something
*NL*
like
the
cries
of
a
child
were
heard
in
Paquette
's
room
.
The
mother
,
*NL*
burst
into
shrieks
of
laughter
,
ascended
the
stairs
as
though
on
wings
,
*NL*
and
entered
.
--
A
frightful
thing
to
tell
,
Oudarde
!
Instead
of
her
pretty
*NL*
little
Agnes
,
so
rosy
and
so
fresh
,
who
was
a
gift
of
the
good
God
,
a
*NL*
sort
of
hideous
little
monster
,
lame
,
one-eyed
,
deformed
,
was
crawling
*NL*
and
squalling
over
the
floor
.
She
hid
her
eyes
in
horror
.
`
Oh
!
'
said
*NL*
she
,
`
have
the
witches
transformed
my
daughter
into
this
horrible
*NL*
animal
?
'
They
hastened
to
carry
away
the
little
club-foot
;
he
would
have
*NL*
driven
her
mad
.
It
was
the
monstrous
child
of
some
gypsy
woman
,
who
had
*NL*
given
herself
to
the
devil
.
He
appeared
to
be
about
four
years
old
,
*NL*
and
talked
a
language
which
was
no
human
tongue
;
there
were
words
in
it
*NL*
which
were
impossible
.
La
Chantefleurie
flung
herself
upon
the
little
*NL*
shoe
,
all
that
remained
to
her
of
all
that
she
loved
.
She
remained
so
*NL*
long
motionless
over
it
,
mute
,
and
without
breath
,
that
they
thought
she
*NL*
was
dead
.
Suddenly
she
trembled
all
over
,
covered
her
relic
with
furious
*NL*
kisses
,
and
burst
out
sobbing
as
though
her
heart
were
broken
.
I
assure
*NL*
you
that
we
were
all
weeping
also
.
She
said
:
`
Oh
,
my
little
daughter
!
my
*NL*
pretty
little
daughter
!
where
art
thou
?
'
--
and
it
wrung
your
very
heart
.
*NL*
I
weep
still
when
I
think
of
it
.
Our
children
are
the
marrow
of
our
*NL*
bones
,
you
see
.
--
My
poor
Eustache
!
thou
art
so
fair
!
--
If
you
only
knew
*NL*
how
nice
he
is
!
yesterday
he
said
to
me
:
'
I
want
to
be
a
gendarme
,
*NL*
that
I
do
.
'
Oh
!
my
Eustache
!
if
I
were
to
lose
thee
!
--
All
at
once
la
*NL*
Chantefleurie
rose
,
and
set
out
to
run
through
Reims
,
screaming
:
`
To
the
*NL*
gypsies
'
camp
!
to
the
gypsies
'
camp
!
Police
,
to
burn
the
witches
!
'
The
*NL*
gypsies
were
gone
.
It
was
pitch
dark
.
They
could
not
be
followed
.
On
the
*NL*
morrow
,
two
leagues
from
Reims
,
on
a
heath
between
Gueux
and
Tilloy
,
the
*NL*
remains
of
a
large
fire
were
found
,
some
ribbons
which
had
belonged
to
*NL*
Paquette
's
child
,
drops
of
blood
,
and
the
dung
of
a
ram
.
The
night
*NL*
just
past
had
been
a
Saturday
.
There
was
no
longer
any
doubt
that
*NL*
the
Egyptians
had
held
their
Sabbath
on
that
heath
,
and
that
they
had
*NL*
devoured
the
child
in
company
with
Beelzebub
,
as
the
practice
is
among
*NL*
the
Mahometans
.
When
La
Chantefleurie
learned
these
horrible
things
,
she
*NL*
did
not
weep
,
she
moved
her
lips
as
though
to
speak
,
but
could
not
.
On
*NL*
the
morrow
,
her
hair
was
gray
.
On
the
second
day
,
she
had
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
in
truth
,
a
frightful
tale
,
''
said
Oudarde
,
``
and
one
which
would
*NL*
make
even
a
Burgundian
weep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
no
longer
surprised
,
''
added
Gervaise
,
``
that
fear
of
the
gypsies
*NL*
should
spur
you
on
so
sharply
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
did
all
the
better
,
''
resumed
Oudarde
,
``
to
flee
with
your
*NL*
Eustache
just
now
,
since
these
also
are
gypsies
from
Poland
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Gervais
,
''
't
is
said
that
they
come
from
Spain
and
Catalonia
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Catalonia
?
't
is
possible
,
''
replied
Oudarde
.
``
Pologne
,
Catalogue
,
*NL*
Valogne
,
I
always
confound
those
three
provinces
,
One
thing
is
certain
,
*NL*
that
they
are
gypsies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
certainly
,
''
added
Gervaise
,
``
have
teeth
long
enough
to
eat
little
*NL*
children
.
I
should
not
be
surprised
if
la
Smeralda
ate
a
little
of
them
*NL*
also
,
though
she
pretends
to
be
dainty
.
Her
white
goat
knows
tricks
that
*NL*
are
too
malicious
for
there
not
to
be
some
impiety
underneath
it
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mahiette
walked
on
in
silence
.
She
was
absorbed
in
that
revery
which
is
,
*NL*
in
some
sort
,
the
continuation
of
a
mournful
tale
,
and
which
ends
only
*NL*
after
having
communicated
the
emotion
,
from
vibration
to
vibration
,
even
*NL*
to
the
very
last
fibres
of
the
heart
.
Nevertheless
,
Gervaise
addressed
*NL*
her
,
``
And
did
they
ever
learn
what
became
of
la
Chantefleurie
?
''
Mahiette
*NL*
made
no
reply
.
Gervaise
repeated
her
question
,
and
shook
her
arm
,
*NL*
calling
her
by
name
.
Mahiette
appeared
to
awaken
from
her
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
became
of
la
Chantefleurie
?
''
she
said
,
repeating
mechanically
*NL*
the
words
whose
impression
was
still
fresh
in
her
ear
;
then
,
ma
king
an
*NL*
effort
to
recall
her
attention
to
the
meaning
of
her
words
,
``
Ah
!
''
she
*NL*
continued
briskly
,
``
no
one
ever
found
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
added
,
after
a
pause
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
said
that
she
had
been
seen
to
quit
Reims
at
nightfall
by
the
*NL*
Flechembault
gate
;
others
,
at
daybreak
,
by
the
old
Basee
gate
.
A
poor
*NL*
man
found
her
gold
cross
hanging
on
the
stone
cross
in
the
field
where
*NL*
the
fair
is
held
.
It
was
that
ornament
which
had
wrought
her
ruin
,
in
*NL*
'
61
.
It
was
a
gift
from
the
handsome
Vicomte
de
Cormontreuil
,
her
first
*NL*
lover
.
Paquette
had
never
been
willing
to
part
with
it
,
wretched
as
she
*NL*
had
been
.
She
had
clung
to
it
as
to
life
itself
.
So
,
when
we
saw
that
*NL*
cross
abandoned
,
we
all
thought
that
she
was
dead
.
Nevertheless
,
there
*NL*
were
people
of
the
Cabaret
les
Vantes
,
who
said
that
they
had
seen
her
*NL*
pass
along
the
road
to
Paris
,
walking
on
the
pebbles
with
her
bare
feet
.
*NL*
But
,
in
that
case
,
she
must
have
gone
out
through
the
Porte
de
Vesle
,
*NL*
and
all
this
does
not
agree
.
Or
,
to
speak
more
truly
,
I
believe
that
*NL*
she
actually
did
depart
by
the
Porte
de
Vesle
,
but
departed
from
this
*NL*
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
understand
you
,
''
said
Gervaise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
La
Vesle

''
replied
Mahiette
,
with
a
melancholy
smile
,
``
is
the
river

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
Chantefleurie

said
Oudarde
,
with
a
shiver

``
drowned

*NL*
``
Drowned

resumed
Mahiette
,
``
who
could
have
told
good
Father

he
passed
under
the
bridge

Tingueux

current
,
singing
in
his
barge
,
that
one
day
his
dear
little
Paquette
*NL*
would
also
pass
beneath
that
bridge

but
without
song

a
big

have
been
well
pleased

But
Gervaise

more
curious

had
not

her

said
suddenly

it
,
*NL*
removed
the
devil
carefully
from
its
body
,
and
sent
it
to
Paris
,
to
be
*NL*
exposed
on
the
wooden
bed
at
Notre-Dame
,
as
a
foundling
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Those
bishops
!
''
grumbled
Gervaise
,
``
because
they
are
learned
,
they
do
*NL*
nothing
like
anybody
else
.
I
just
put
it
to
you
,
Oudarde
,
the
idea
of
*NL*
placing
the
devil
among
the
foundlings
!
For
that
little
monster
was
*NL*
assuredly
the
devil
.
Well
,
Mahiette
,
what
did
they
do
with
it
in
Paris
?
*NL*
I
am
quite
sure
that
no
charitable
person
wanted
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
know
,
''
replied
the
Remoise
,
''
't
was
just
at
that
time
that
my
*NL*
husband
bought
the
office
of
notary
,
at
Bern
,
two
leagues
from
the
town
,
*NL*
and
we
were
no
longer
occupied
with
that
story
;
besides
,
in
front
*NL*
of
Bern
,
stand
the
two
hills
of
Cernay
,
which
hide
the
towers
of
the
*NL*
cathedral
in
Reims
from
view
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
chatting
thus
,
the
three
worthy
_
bourgeoises
_
had
arrived
at
the
*NL*
Place
de
Greve
.
In
their
absorption
,
they
had
passed
the
public
breviary
*NL*
of
the
Tour-Roland
without
stopping
,
and
took
their
way
mechanically
*NL*
towards
the
pillory
around
which
the
throng
was
growing
more
dense
with
*NL*
every
moment
.
It
is
probable
that
the
spectacle
which
at
that
moment
*NL*
attracted
all
looks
in
that
direction
,
would
have
made
them
forget
*NL*
completely
the
Rat-Hole
,
and
the
halt
which
they
intended
to
make
there
,
*NL*
if
big
Eustache
,
six
years
of
age
,
whom
Mahiette
was
dragging
along
by
*NL*
the
hand
,
had
not
abruptly
recalled
the
object
to
them
:
``
Mother
,
''
said
*NL*
he
,
as
though
some
instinct
warned
him
that
the
Rat-Hole
was
behind
him
,
*NL*
``
can
I
eat
the
cake
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
Eustache
had
been
more
adroit
,
that
is
to
say
,
less
greedy
,
he
*NL*
would
have
continued
to
wait
,
and
would
only
have
hazarded
that
simple
*NL*
question
,
``
Mother
,
can
I
eat
the
cake
,
now
?
''
on
their
return
to
the
*NL*
University
,
to
Master
Andry
Musnier
's
,
Rue
Madame
la
Valence
,
when
he
*NL*
had
the
two
arms
of
the
Seine
and
the
five
bridges
of
the
city
between
*NL*
the
Rat-Hole
and
the
cake
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
question
,
highly
imprudent
at
the
moment
when
Eustache
put
it
,
*NL*
aroused
Mahiette
's
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
way
,
''
she
exclaimed
,
``
we
are
forgetting
the
recluse
!
Show
me
the
*NL*
Rat-Hole
,
that
I
may
carry
her
her
cake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Immediately
,
''
said
Oudarde
,
''
't
is
a
charity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
did
not
suit
Eustache
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
!
my
cake
!
''
said
he
,
rubbing
both
ears
alternatively
with
his
*NL*
shoulders
,
which
,
in
such
cases
,
is
the
supreme
sign
of
discontent
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
three
women
retraced
their
steps
,
and
,
on
arriving
in
the
vicinity
*NL*
of
the
Tour-Roland
,
Oudarde
said
to
the
other
two
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
not
all
three
gaze
into
the
hole
at
once
,
for
fear
of
alarming
*NL*
the
recluse
.
Do
you
two
pretend
to
read
the
_
Dominus
_
in
the
breviary
,
*NL*
while
I
thrust
my
nose
into
the
aperture
;
the
recluse
knows
me
a
little
.
*NL*
I
will
give
you
warning
when
you
can
approach
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
proceeded
alone
to
the
window
.
At
the
moment
when
she
looked
in
,
*NL*
a
profound
pity
was
depicted
on
all
her
features
,
and
her
frank
,
gay
*NL*
visage
altered
its
expression
and
color
as
abruptly
as
though
it
had
*NL*
passed
from
a
ray
of
sunlight
to
a
ray
of
moonlight
;
her
eye
became
*NL*
humid
;
her
mouth
contracted
,
like
that
of
a
person
on
the
point
of
*NL*
weeping
.
A
moment
later
,
she
laid
her
finger
on
her
lips
,
and
made
a
*NL*
sign
to
Mahiette
to
draw
near
and
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mahiette
,
much
touched
,
stepped
up
in
silence
,
on
tiptoe
,
as
though
*NL*
approaching
the
bedside
of
a
dying
person
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
,
in
fact
,
a
melancholy
spectacle
which
presented
itself
to
*NL*
the
eyes
of
the
two
women
,
as
they
gazed
through
the
grating
of
the
*NL*
Rat-Hole
,
neither
stirring
nor
breathing
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cell
was
small
,
broader
than
it
was
long
,
with
an
arched
ceiling
,
*NL*
and
viewed
from
within
,
it
bore
a
considerable
resemblance
to
the
*NL*
interior
of
a
huge
bishop
's
mitre
.
On
the
bare
flagstones
which
formed
*NL*
the
floor
,
in
one
corner
,
a
woman
was
sitting
,
or
rather
,
crouching
.
Her
*NL*
chin
rested
on
her
knees
,
which
her
crossed
arms
pressed
forcibly
to
*NL*
her
breast
.
Thus
doubled
up
,
clad
in
a
brown
sack
,
which
enveloped
*NL*
her
entirely
in
large
folds
,
her
long
,
gray
hair
pulled
over
in
front
,
*NL*
falling
over
her
face
and
along
her
legs
nearly
to
her
feet
,
she
*NL*
presented
,
at
the
first
glance
,
only
a
strange
form
outlined
against
the
*NL*
dark
background
of
the
cell
,
a
sort
of
dusky
triangle
,
which
the
ray
of
*NL*
daylight
falling
through
the
opening
,
cut
roughly
into
two
shades
,
the
*NL*
one
sombre
,
the
other
illuminated
.
It
was
one
of
those
spectres
,
*NL*
half
light
,
half
shadow
,
such
as
one
beholds
in
dreams
and
in
the
*NL*
extraordinary
work
of
Goya
,
pale
,
motionless
,
sinister
,
crouching
over
a
*NL*
tomb
,
or
leaning
against
the
grating
of
a
prison
cell
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
neither
a
woman
,
nor
a
man
,
nor
a
living
being
,
nor
a
definite
*NL*
form
;
it
was
a
figure
,
a
sort
of
vision
,
in
which
the
real
and
the
*NL*
fantastic
intersected
each
other
,
like
darkness
and
day
.
It
was
with
*NL*
difficulty
that
one
distinguished
,
beneath
her
hair
which
spread
to
*NL*
the
ground
,
a
gaunt
and
severe
profile
;
her
dress
barely
allowed
the
*NL*
extremity
of
a
bare
foot
to
escape
,
which
contracted
on
the
hard
,
cold
*NL*
pavement
.
The
little
of
human
form
of
which
one
caught
a
sight
beneath
*NL*
this
envelope
of
mourning
,
caused
a
shudder
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
figure
,
which
one
might
have
supposed
to
be
riveted
to
the
*NL*
flagstones
,
appeared
to
possess
neither
movement
,
nor
thought
,
nor
*NL*
breath
.
Lying
,
in
January
,
in
that
thin
,
linen
sack
,
lying
on
a
granite
*NL*
floor
,
without
fire
,
in
the
gloom
of
a
cell
whose
oblique
air-hole
*NL*
allowed
only
the
cold
breeze
,
but
never
the
sun
,
to
enter
from
without
,
*NL*
she
did
not
appear
to
suffer
or
even
to
think
.
One
would
have
said
that
*NL*
she
had
turned
to
stone
with
the
cell
,
ice
with
the
season
.
Her
hands
*NL*
were
clasped
,
her
eyes
fixed
.
At
first
sight
one
took
her
for
a
spectre
;
*NL*
at
the
second
,
for
a
statue
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
at
intervals
,
her
blue
lips
half
opened
to
admit
a
breath
,
*NL*
and
trembled
,
but
as
dead
and
as
mechanical
as
the
leaves
which
the
wind
*NL*
sweeps
aside
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
from
her
dull
eyes
there
escaped
a
look
,
an
ineffable
*NL*
look
,
a
profound
,
lugubrious
,
imperturbable
look
,
incessantly
fixed
upon
*NL*
a
corner
of
the
cell
which
could
not
be
seen
from
without
;
a
gaze
which
*NL*
seemed
to
fix
all
the
sombre
thoughts
of
that
soul
in
distress
upon
some
*NL*
mysterious
object
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
the
creature
who
had
received
,
from
her
habitation
,
the
name
of
*NL*
the
``
recluse
''
;
and
,
from
her
garment
,
the
name
of
``
the
sacked
nun
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
three
women
,
for
Gervaise
had
rejoined
Mahiette
and
Oudarde
,
gazed
*NL*
through
the
window
.
Their
heads
intercepted
the
feeble
light
in
the
*NL*
cell
,
without
the
wretched
being
whom
they
thus
deprived
of
it
seeming
*NL*
to
pay
any
attention
to
them
.
``
Do
not
let
us
trouble
her
,
''
said
Oudarde
,
*NL*
in
a
low
voice
,
``
she
is
in
her
ecstasy
;
she
is
praying
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
Mahiette
was
gazing
with
ever-increasing
anxiety
at
that
wan
,
*NL*
withered
,
dishevelled
head
,
and
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
.
``
This
is
*NL*
very
singular
,
''
she
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
thrust
her
head
through
the
bars
,
and
succeeded
in
casting
a
glance
*NL*
at
the
corner
where
the
gaze
of
the
unhappy
woman
was
immovably
riveted
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
withdrew
her
head
from
the
window
,
her
countenance
was
*NL*
inundated
with
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
call
that
woman
?
''
she
asked
Oudarde
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oudarde
replied
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
call
her
Sister
Gudule
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
,
''
returned
Mahiette
,
``
call
her
Paquette
la
Chantefleurie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
laying
her
finger
on
her
lips
,
she
motioned
to
the
astounded
*NL*
Oudarde
to
thrust
her
head
through
the
window
and
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oudarde
looked
and
beheld
,
in
the
corner
where
the
eyes
of
the
*NL*
recluse
were
fixed
in
that
sombre
ecstasy
,
a
tiny
shoe
of
pink
satin
,
*NL*
embroidered
with
a
thousand
fanciful
designs
in
gold
and
silver
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gervaise
looked
after
Oudarde
,
and
then
the
three
women
,
gazing
upon
the
*NL*
unhappy
mother
,
began
to
weep
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
neither
their
looks
nor
their
tears
disturbed
the
recluse
.
Her
hands
*NL*
remained
clasped
;
her
lips
mute
;
her
eyes
fixed
;
and
that
little
shoe
,
*NL*
thus
gazed
at
,
broke
the
heart
of
any
one
who
knew
her
history
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
three
women
had
not
yet
uttered
a
single
word
;
they
dared
not
speak
,
*NL*
even
in
a
low
voice
.
This
deep
silence
,
this
deep
grief
,
this
profound
*NL*
oblivion
in
which
everything
had
disappeared
except
one
thing
,
produced
*NL*
upon
them
the
effect
of
the
grand
altar
at
Christmas
or
Easter
.
They
*NL*
remained
silent
,
they
meditated
,
they
were
ready
to
kneel
.
It
seemed
to
*NL*
them
that
they
were
ready
to
enter
a
church
on
the
day
of
Tenebrae
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
Gervaise
,
the
most
curious
of
the
three
,
and
consequently
the
*NL*
least
sensitive
,
tried
to
make
the
recluse
speak
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sister
!
Sister
Gudule
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
repeated
this
call
three
times
,
raising
her
voice
each
time
.
The
*NL*
recluse
did
not
move
;
not
a
word
,
not
a
glance
,
not
a
sigh
,
not
a
sign
*NL*
of
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oudarde
,
in
her
turn
,
in
a
sweeter
,
more
caressing
voice
,
--
``
Sister
!
''
*NL*
said
she
,
``
Sister
Sainte-Gudule
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
same
silence
;
the
same
immobility
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
singular
woman
!
''
exclaimed
Gervaise
,
``
and
one
not
to
be
moved
by
a
*NL*
catapult
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perchance
she
is
deaf
,
''
said
Oudarde
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
she
is
blind
,
''
added
Gervaise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dead
,
perchance
,
''
returned
Mahiette
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
certain
that
if
the
soul
had
not
already
quitted
this
inert
,
*NL*
sluggish
,
lethargic
body
,
it
had
at
least
retreated
and
concealed
itself
*NL*
in
depths
whither
the
perceptions
of
the
exterior
organs
no
longer
*NL*
penetrated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
we
must
leave
the
cake
on
the
window
,
''
said
Oudarde
;
``
some
scamp
*NL*
will
take
it
.
What
shall
we
do
to
rouse
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Eustache
,
who
,
up
to
that
moment
had
been
diverted
by
a
little
carriage
*NL*
drawn
by
a
large
dog
,
which
had
just
passed
,
suddenly
perceived
that
his
*NL*
three
conductresses
were
gazing
at
something
through
the
window
,
and
,
*NL*
curiosity
taking
possession
of
him
in
his
turn
,
he
climbed
upon
a
stone
*NL*
post
,
elevated
himself
on
tiptoe
,
and
applied
his
fat
,
red
face
to
the
*NL*
opening
,
shouting
,
``
Mother
,
let
me
see
too
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
sound
of
this
clear
,
fresh
,
ringing
child
's
voice
,
the
recluse
*NL*
trembled
;
she
turned
her
head
with
the
sharp
,
abrupt
movement
of
a
steel
*NL*
spring
,
her
long
,
fleshless
hands
cast
aside
the
hair
from
her
brow
,
*NL*
and
she
fixed
upon
the
child
,
bitter
,
astonished
,
desperate
eyes
.
This
*NL*
glance
was
but
a
lightning
flash
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
my
God
!
''
she
suddenly
exclaimed
,
hiding
her
head
on
her
knees
,
and
*NL*
it
seemed
as
though
her
hoarse
voice
tore
her
chest
as
it
passed
from
*NL*
it
,
``
do
not
show
me
those
of
others
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
day
,
madam
,
''
said
the
child
,
gravely
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
this
shock
had
,
so
to
speak
,
awakened
the
recluse
.
A
long
*NL*
shiver
traversed
her
frame
from
head
to
foot
;
her
teeth
chattered
;
she
*NL*
half
raised
her
head
and
said
,
pressing
her
elbows
against
her
hips
,
and
*NL*
clasping
her
feet
in
her
hands
as
though
to
warm
them
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
how
cold
it
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
woman
!
''
said
Oudarde
,
with
great
compassion
,
``
would
you
like
a
*NL*
little
fire
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
shook
her
head
in
token
of
refusal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
resumed
Oudarde
,
presenting
her
with
a
flagon
;
``
here
is
some
*NL*
hippocras
which
will
warm
you
;
drink
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
she
shook
her
head
,
looked
at
Oudarde
fixedly
and
replied
,
*NL*
``
Water
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Oudarde
persisted
,
--
``
No
,
sister
,
that
is
no
beverage
for
January
.
You
*NL*
must
drink
a
little
hippocras
and
eat
this
leavened
cake
of
maize
,
which
*NL*
we
have
baked
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
refused
the
cake
which
Mahiette
offered
to
her
,
and
said
,
``
Black
*NL*
bread
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
''
said
Gervaise
,
seized
in
her
turn
with
an
impulse
of
charity
,
*NL*
and
unfastening
her
woolen
cloak
,
``
here
is
a
cloak
which
is
a
little
*NL*
warmer
than
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
refused
the
cloak
as
she
had
refused
the
flagon
and
the
cake
,
and
*NL*
replied
,
``
A
sack
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
resumed
the
good
Oudarde
,
``
you
must
have
perceived
to
some
*NL*
extent
,
that
yesterday
was
a
festival
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
perceive
it
,
''
said
the
recluse
;
''
't
is
two
days
now
since
I
have
*NL*
had
any
water
in
my
crock
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
added
,
after
a
silence
,
''
'T
is
a
festival
,
I
am
forgotten
.
People
do
*NL*
well
.
Why
should
the
world
think
of
me
,
when
I
do
not
think
of
it
?
Cold
*NL*
charcoal
makes
cold
ashes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
as
though
fatigued
with
having
said
so
much
,
she
dropped
her
head
on
*NL*
her
knees
again
.
The
simple
and
charitable
Oudarde
,
who
fancied
that
*NL*
she
understood
from
her
last
words
that
she
was
complaining
of
the
cold
,
*NL*
replied
innocently
,
``
Then
you
would
like
a
little
fire
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fire
!
''
said
the
sacked
nun
,
with
a
strange
accent
;
``
and
will
you
also
*NL*
make
a
little
for
the
poor
little
one
who
has
been
beneath
the
sod
for
*NL*
these
fifteen
years
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Every
limb
was
trembling
,
her
voice
quivered
,
her
eyes
flashed
,
she
had
*NL*
raised
herself
upon
her
knees
;
suddenly
she
extended
her
thin
,
*NL*
white
hand
towards
the
child
,
who
was
regarding
her
with
a
look
of
*NL*
astonishment
.
``
Take
away
that
child
!
''
she
cried
.
``
The
Egyptian
woman
is
*NL*
about
to
pass
by
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
fell
face
downward
on
the
earth
,
and
her
forehead
struck
the
*NL*
stone
,
with
the
sound
of
one
stone
against
another
stone
.
The
three
*NL*
women
thought
her
dead
.
A
moment
later
,
however
,
she
moved
,
and
they
*NL*
beheld
her
drag
herself
,
on
her
knees
and
elbows
,
to
the
corner
where
*NL*
the
little
shoe
was
.
Then
they
dared
not
look
;
they
no
longer
saw
her
;
*NL*
but
they
heard
a
thousand
kisses
and
a
thousand
sighs
,
mingled
with
*NL*
heartrending
cries
,
and
dull
blows
like
those
of
a
head
in
contact
with
*NL*
a
wall
.
Then
,
after
one
of
these
blows
,
so
violent
that
all
three
of
*NL*
them
staggered
,
they
heard
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
she
have
killed
herself
?
''
said
Gervaise
,
venturing
to
pass
her
head
*NL*
through
the
air-hole
.
``
Sister
!
Sister
Gudule
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sister
Gudule
!
''
repeated
Oudarde
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
good
heavens
!
she
no
longer
moves
!
''
resumed
Gervaise
;
``
is
she
dead
?
*NL*
Gudule
!
Gudule
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mahiette
,
choked
to
such
a
point
that
she
could
not
speak
,
made
an
*NL*
effort
.
``
Wait
,
''
said
she
.
Then
bending
towards
the
window
,
``
Paquette
!
''
*NL*
she
said
,
``
Paquette
le
Chantefleurie
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
child
who
innocently
blows
upon
the
badly
ignited
fuse
of
a
bomb
,
and
*NL*
makes
it
explode
in
his
face
,
is
no
more
terrified
than
was
Mahiette
*NL*
at
the
effect
of
that
name
,
abruptly
launched
into
the
cell
of
Sister
*NL*
Gudule
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
recluse
trembled
all
over
,
rose
erect
on
her
bare
feet
,
and
leaped
*NL*
at
the
window
with
eyes
so
glaring
that
Mahiette
and
Oudarde
,
and
the
*NL*
other
woman
and
the
child
recoiled
even
to
the
parapet
of
the
quay
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
the
sinister
face
of
the
recluse
appeared
pressed
to
the
*NL*
grating
of
the
air-hole
.
``
Oh
!
oh
!
''
she
cried
,
with
an
appalling
laugh
;
*NL*
''
't
is
the
Egyptian
who
is
calling
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
,
a
scene
which
was
passing
at
the
pillory
caught
her
wild
*NL*
eye
.
Her
brow
contracted
with
horror
,
she
stretched
her
two
skeleton
*NL*
arms
from
her
cell
,
and
shrieked
in
a
voice
which
resembled
a
*NL*
death-rattle
,
``
So
't
is
thou
once
more
,
daughter
of
Egypt

'T
is
thou
*NL*
who
callest

CHAPTER
IV
.
A
TEAR
FOR
A
DROP
OF
WATER
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
These
words
were
,
so
to
speak
,
the
point
of
union
of
two
scenes
,
which
*NL*
had
,
up
to
that
time
,
been
developed
in
parallel
lines
at
the
same
*NL*
moment
,
each
on
its
particular
theatre
;
one
,
that
which
the
reader
has
*NL*
just
perused
,
in
the
Rat-Hole
;
the
other
,
which
he
is
about
to
read
,
on
*NL*
the
ladder
of
the
pillory
.
The
first
had
for
witnesses
only
the
three
*NL*
women
with
whom
the
reader
has
just
made
acquaintance
;
the
second
had
*NL*
for
spectators
all
the
public
which
we
have
seen
above
,
collecting
on
*NL*
the
Place
de
Greve
,
around
the
pillory
and
the
gibbet
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
crowd
which
the
four
sergeants
posted
at
nine
o'clock
in
the
*NL*
morning
at
the
four
corners
of
the
pillory
had
inspired
with
the
hope
*NL*
of
some
sort
of
an
execution
,
no
doubt
,
not
a
hanging
,
but
a
whipping
,
*NL*
a
cropping
of
ears
,
something
,
in
short
,
--
that
crowd
had
increased
so
*NL*
rapidly
that
the
four
policemen
,
too
closely
besieged
,
had
had
occasion
*NL*
to
``
press
''
it
,
as
the
expression
then
ran
,
more
than
once
,
by
sound
*NL*
blows
of
their
whips
,
and
the
haunches
of
their
horses
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
populace
,
disciplined
to
waiting
for
public
executions
,
did
not
*NL*
manifest
very
much
impatience
.
It
amused
itself
with
watching
the
*NL*
pillory
,
a
very
simple
sort
of
monument
,
composed
of
a
cube
of
masonry
*NL*
about
six
feet
high
and
hollow
in
the
interior
.
A
very
steep
staircase
,
*NL*
of
unhewn
stone
,
which
was
called
by
distinction
``
the
ladder
,
''
led
to
*NL*
the
upper
platform
,
upon
which
was
visible
a
horizontal
wheel
of
solid
*NL*
oak
.
The
victim
was
bound
upon
this
wheel
,
on
his
knees
,
with
his
hands
*NL*
behind
his
back
.
A
wooden
shaft
,
which
set
in
motion
a
capstan
concealed
*NL*
in
the
interior
of
the
little
edifice
,
imparted
a
rotatory
motion
to
*NL*
the
wheel
,
which
always
maintained
its
horizontal
position
,
and
in
this
*NL*
manner
presented
the
face
of
the
condemned
man
to
all
quarters
of
the
*NL*
square
in
succession
.
This
was
what
was
called
``
turning
''
a
criminal
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
reader
perceives
,
the
pillory
of
the
Greve
was
far
from
*NL*
presenting
all
the
recreations
of
the
pillory
of
the
Halles
.
Nothing
*NL*
architectural
,
nothing
monumental
.
No
roof
to
the
iron
cross
,
no
*NL*
octagonal
lantern
,
no
frail
,
slender
columns
spreading
out
on
the
edge
*NL*
of
the
roof
into
capitals
of
acanthus
leaves
and
flowers
,
no
waterspouts
*NL*
of
chimeras
and
monsters
,
on
carved
woodwork
,
no
fine
sculpture
,
deeply
*NL*
sunk
in
the
stone
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
forced
to
content
themselves
with
those
four
stretches
of
*NL*
rubble
work
,
backed
with
sandstone
,
and
a
wretched
stone
gibbet
,
meagre
*NL*
and
bare
,
on
one
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
entertainment
would
have
been
but
a
poor
one
for
lovers
of
Gothic
*NL*
architecture
.
It
is
true
that
nothing
was
ever
less
curious
on
the
score
*NL*
of
architecture
than
the
worthy
gapers
of
the
Middle
Ages
,
and
that
they
*NL*
cared
very
little
for
the
beauty
of
a
pillory
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
victim
finally
arrived
,
bound
to
the
tail
of
a
cart
,
and
when
he
had
*NL*
been
hoisted
upon
the
platform
,
where
he
could
be
seen
from
all
points
*NL*
of
the
Place
,
bound
with
cords
and
straps
upon
the
wheel
of
the
pillory
,
*NL*
a
prodigious
hoot
,
mingled
with
laughter
and
acclamations
,
burst
forth
*NL*
upon
the
Place
.
They
had
recognized
Quasimodo
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
he
,
in
fact
.
The
change
was
singular
.
Pilloried
on
the
very
place
*NL*
where
,
on
the
day
before
,
he
had
been
saluted
,
acclaimed
,
and
proclaimed
*NL*
Pope
and
Prince
of
Fools
,
in
the
cortege
of
the
Duke
of
Egypt
,
the
King
*NL*
of
Thunes
,
and
the
Emperor
of
Galilee
!
One
thing
is
certain
,
and
that
*NL*
is
,
that
there
was
not
a
soul
in
the
crowd
,
not
even
himself
,
though
in
*NL*
turn
triumphant
and
the
sufferer
,
who
set
forth
this
combination
clearly
*NL*
in
his
thought
.
Gringoire
and
his
philosophy
were
missing
at
this
*NL*
spectacle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
Michel
Noiret
,
sworn
trumpeter
to
the
king
,
our
lord
,
imposed
*NL*
silence
on
the
louts
,
and
proclaimed
the
sentence
,
in
accordance
with
*NL*
the
order
and
command
of
monsieur
the
provost
.
Then
he
withdrew
behind
*NL*
the
cart
,
with
his
men
in
livery
surcoats
.
*NL*
*NL*
Quasimodo
,
impassible
,
did
not
wince
.
All
resistance
had
been
rendered
*NL*
impossible
to
him
by
what
was
then
called
,
in
the
style
of
the
criminal
*NL*
chancellery
,
``
the
vehemence
and
firmness
of
the
bonds
''
which
means
that
*NL*
the
thongs
and
chains
probably
cut
into
his
flesh
;
moreover
,
it
is
a
*NL*
tradition
of
jail
and
wardens
,
which
has
not
been
lost
,
and
which
the
*NL*
handcuffs
still
preciously
preserve
among
us
,
a
civilized
,
gentle
,
*NL*
humane
people
-LRB-
the
galleys
and
the
guillotine
in
parentheses
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
allowed
himself
to
be
led
,
pushed
,
carried
,
lifted
,
bound
,
*NL*
and
bound
again
.
Nothing
was
to
be
seen
upon
his
countenance
but
the
*NL*
astonishment
of
a
savage
or
an
idiot
.
He
was
known
to
be
deaf
;
one
might
*NL*
have
pronounced
him
to
be
blind
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
placed
him
on
his
knees
on
the
circular
plank
;
he
made
no
*NL*
resistance
.
They
removed
his
shirt
and
doublet
as
far
as
his
girdle
;
he
*NL*
allowed
them
to
have
their
way
.
They
entangled
him
under
a
fresh
system
*NL*
of
thongs
and
buckles
;
he
allowed
them
to
bind
and
buckle
him
.
Only
from
*NL*
time
to
time
he
snorted
noisily
,
like
a
calf
whose
head
is
hanging
and
*NL*
bumping
over
the
edge
of
a
butcher
's
cart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
dolt
,
''
said
Jehan
Frollo
of
the
Mill
,
to
his
friend
Robin
*NL*
Poussepain
-LRB-
for
the
two
students
had
followed
the
culprit
,
as
was
to
*NL*
have
been
expected
-RRB-
,
``
he
understands
no
more
than
a
cockchafer
shut
up
*NL*
in
a
box
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
wild
laughter
among
the
crowd
when
they
beheld
Quasimodo
's
*NL*
hump
,
his
camel
's
breast
,
his
callous
and
hairy
shoulders
laid
bare
.
*NL*
During
this
gayety
,
a
man
in
the
livery
of
the
city
,
short
of
stature
*NL*
and
robust
of
mien
,
mounted
the
platform
and
placed
himself
near
the
*NL*
victim
.
His
name
speedily
circulated
among
the
spectators
.
It
was
Master
*NL*
Pierrat
Torterue
,
official
torturer
to
the
Chatelet
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
began
by
depositing
on
an
angle
of
the
pillory
a
black
hour-glass
,
*NL*
the
upper
lobe
of
which
was
filled
with
red
sand
,
which
it
allowed
*NL*
to
glide
into
the
lower
receptacle
;
then
he
removed
his
parti-colored
*NL*
surtout
,
and
there
became
visible
,
suspended
from
his
right
hand
,
a
*NL*
thin
and
tapering
whip
of
long
,
white
,
shining
,
knotted
,
plaited
thongs
,
*NL*
armed
with
metal
nails
.
With
his
left
hand
,
he
negligently
folded
back
*NL*
his
shirt
around
his
right
arm
,
to
the
very
armpit
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
Jehan
Frollo
,
elevating
his
curly
blonde
head
above
*NL*
the
crowd
-LRB-
he
had
mounted
upon
the
shoulders
of
Robin
Poussepain
for
the
*NL*
purpose
-RRB-
,
shouted
:
``
Come
and
look
,
gentle
ladies
and
men
!
they
are
*NL*
going
to
peremptorily
flagellate
Master
Quasimodo
,
the
bellringer
of
*NL*
my
brother
,
monsieur
the
archdeacon
of
Josas
,
a
knave
of
oriental
*NL*
architecture
,
who
has
a
back
like
a
dome
,
and
legs
like
twisted
*NL*
columns
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
crowd
burst
into
a
laugh
,
especially
the
boys
and
young
girls
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
the
torturer
stamped
his
foot
.
The
wheel
began
to
turn
.
*NL*
Quasimodo
wavered
beneath
his
bonds
.
The
amazement
which
was
suddenly
*NL*
depicted
upon
his
deformed
face
caused
the
bursts
of
laughter
to
*NL*
redouble
around
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
,
at
the
moment
when
the
wheel
in
its
revolution
presented
to
*NL*
Master
Pierrat
,
the
humped
back
of
Quasimodo
,
Master
Pierrat
raised
his
*NL*
arm
;
the
fine
thongs
whistled
sharply
through
the
air
,
like
a
handful
of
*NL*
adders
,
and
fell
with
fury
upon
the
wretch
's
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
Quasimodo
leaped
as
though
awakened
with
a
start
.
He
began
to
*NL*
understand
.
He
writhed
in
his
bonds
;
a
violent
contraction
of
surprise
*NL*
and
pain
distorted
the
muscles
of
his
face
,
but
he
uttered
not
a
single
*NL*
sigh
.
He
merely
turned
his
head
backward
,
to
the
right
,
then
to
the
*NL*
left
,
balancing
it
as
a
bull
does
who
has
been
stung
in
the
flanks
by
a
*NL*
gadfly
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
second
blow
followed
the
first
,
then
a
third
,
and
another
and
another
,
*NL*
and
still
others
.
The
wheel
did
not
cease
to
turn
,
nor
the
blows
to
rain
*NL*
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
the
blood
burst
forth
,
and
could
be
seen
trickling
in
a
thousand
*NL*
threads
down
the
hunchback
's
black
shoulders
;
and
the
slender
thongs
,
in
*NL*
their
rotatory
motion
which
rent
the
air
,
sprinkled
drops
of
it
upon
the
*NL*
crowd
.
*NL*
*NL*
Quasimodo
had
resumed
,
to
all
appearance
,
his
first
imperturbability
.
He
*NL*
had
at
first
tried
,
in
a
quiet
way
and
without
much
outward
movement
,
*NL*
to
break
his
bonds
.
His
eye
had
been
seen
to
light
up
,
his
muscles
*NL*
to
stiffen
,
his
members
to
concentrate
their
force
,
and
the
straps
*NL*
to
stretch
.
The
effort
was
powerful
,
prodigious
,
desperate
;
but
the
*NL*
provost
's
seasoned
bonds
resisted
.
They
cracked
,
and
that
was
all
.
*NL*
Quasimodo
fell
back
exhausted
.
Amazement
gave
way
,
on
his
features
,
to
*NL*
a
sentiment
of
profound
and
bitter
discouragement
.
He
closed
his
single
*NL*
eye
,
allowed
his
head
to
droop
upon
his
breast
,
and
feigned
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
that
moment
forth
,
he
stirred
no
more
.
Nothing
could
force
a
*NL*
movement
from
him
.
Neither
his
blood
,
which
did
not
cease
to
flow
,
nor
*NL*
the
blows
which
redoubled
in
fury
,
nor
the
wrath
of
the
torturer
,
who
*NL*
grew
excited
himself
and
intoxicated
with
the
execution
,
nor
the
sound
*NL*
of
the
horrible
thongs
,
more
sharp
and
whistling
than
the
claws
of
*NL*
scorpions
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
a
bailiff
from
the
Chatelet
clad
in
black
,
mounted
on
a
black
*NL*
horse
,
who
had
been
stationed
beside
the
ladder
since
the
beginning
*NL*
of
the
execution
,
extended
his
ebony
wand
towards
the
hour-glass
.
The
*NL*
torturer
stopped
.
The
wheel
stopped
.
Quasimodo
's
eye
opened
slowly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
scourging
was
finished
.
Two
lackeys
of
the
official
torturer
bathed
*NL*
the
bleeding
shoulders
of
the
patient
,
anointed
them
with
some
unguent
*NL*
which
immediately
closed
all
the
wounds
,
and
threw
upon
his
back
a
sort
*NL*
of
yellow
vestment
,
in
cut
like
a
chasuble
.
In
the
meanwhile
,
Pierrat
*NL*
Torterue
allowed
the
thongs
,
red
and
gorged
with
blood
,
to
drip
upon
the
*NL*
pavement
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
was
not
over
for
Quasimodo
.
He
had
still
to
undergo
that
hour
of
*NL*
pillory
which
Master
Florian
Barbedienne
had
so
judiciously
added
to
the
*NL*
sentence
of
Messire
Robert
d'Estouteville
;
all
to
the
greater
glory
*NL*
of
the
old
physiological
and
psychological
play
upon
words
of
Jean
de
*NL*
Cumene
,
_
Surdus
absurdus
_
:
a
deaf
man
is
absurd
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
hour-glass
was
turned
over
once
more
,
and
they
left
the
hunchback
*NL*
fastened
to
the
plank
,
in
order
that
justice
might
be
accomplished
to
*NL*
the
very
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
populace
,
especially
in
the
Middle
Ages
,
is
in
society
what
the
*NL*
child
is
in
the
family
.
As
long
as
it
remains
in
its
state
of
primitive
*NL*
ignorance
,
of
moral
and
intellectual
minority
,
it
can
be
said
of
it
as
*NL*
of
the
child
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
'T
is
the
pitiless
age
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
already
shown
that
Quasimodo
was
generally
hated
,
for
more
than
*NL*
one
good
reason
,
it
is
true
.
There
was
hardly
a
spectator
in
that
crowd
*NL*
who
had
not
or
who
did
not
believe
that
he
had
reason
to
complain
of
the
*NL*
malevolent
hunchback
of
Notre-Dame
.
The
joy
at
seeing
him
appear
thus
*NL*
in
the
pillory
had
been
universal
;
and
the
harsh
punishment
which
he
had
*NL*
just
suffered
,
and
the
pitiful
condition
in
which
it
had
left
him
,
far
*NL*
from
softening
the
populace
had
rendered
its
hatred
more
malicious
by
*NL*
arming
it
with
a
touch
of
mirth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hence
,
the
``
public
prosecution
''
satisfied
,
as
the
bigwigs
of
the
law
*NL*
still
express
it
in
their
jargon
,
the
turn
came
of
a
thousand
private
*NL*
vengeances
.
Here
,
as
in
the
Grand
Hall
,
the
women
rendered
themselves
*NL*
particularly
prominent
.
All
cherished
some
rancor
against
him
,
some
for
*NL*
his
malice
,
others
for
his
ugliness
.
The
latter
were
the
most
furious
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
mask
of
Antichrist
!
''
said
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rider
on
a
broom
handle
!
''
cried
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
fine
tragic
grimace
,
''
howled
a
third
,
``
and
who
would
make
him
*NL*
Pope
of
the
Fools
if
to-day
were
yesterday
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
well
,
''
struck
in
an
old
woman
.
``
This
is
the
grimace
of
the
*NL*
pillory
.
When
shall
we
have
that
of
the
gibbet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
will
you
be
coiffed
with
your
big
bell
a
hundred
feet
under
*NL*
ground
,
cursed
bellringer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
't
is
the
devil
who
rings
the
Angelus
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
the
deaf
man
!
the
one-eyed
creature
!
the
hunch-back
!
the
monster
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
face
to
make
a
woman
miscarry
better
than
all
the
drugs
and
*NL*
medicines
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
two
scholars
,
Jehan
du
Moulin
,
and
Robin
Poussepain
,
sang
at
the
*NL*
top
of
their
lungs
,
the
ancient
refrain
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Une
hart
*NL*
Pour
le
pendard
!
*NL*
Un
fagot
*NL*
Pour
le
magot
_
!
''
*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
A
rope
for
the
gallows
bird
!
A
fagot
for
the
ape
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
thousand
other
insults
rained
down
upon
him
,
and
hoots
and
*NL*
imprecations
,
and
laughter
,
and
now
and
then
,
stones
.
*NL*
*NL*
Quasimodo
was
deaf
but
his
sight
was
clear
,
and
the
public
fury
was
*NL*
no
less
energetically
depicted
on
their
visages
than
in
their
words
.
*NL*
Moreover
,
the
blows
from
the
stones
explained
the
bursts
of
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
he
held
his
ground
.
But
little
by
little
that
patience
which
*NL*
had
borne
up
under
the
lash
of
the
torturer
,
yielded
and
gave
way
before
*NL*
all
these
stings
of
insects
.
The
bull
of
the
Asturias
who
has
been
but
*NL*
little
moved
by
the
attacks
of
the
picador
grows
irritated
with
the
dogs
*NL*
and
banderilleras
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
first
cast
around
a
slow
glance
of
hatred
upon
the
crowd
.
But
bound
*NL*
as
he
was
,
his
glance
was
powerless
to
drive
away
those
flies
which
*NL*
were
stinging
his
wound
.
Then
he
moved
in
his
bonds
,
and
his
furious
*NL*
exertions
made
the
ancient
wheel
of
the
pillory
shriek
on
its
axle
.
All
*NL*
this
only
increased
the
derision
and
hooting
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
wretched
man
,
unable
to
break
his
collar
,
like
that
of
a
*NL*
chained
wild
beast
,
became
tranquil
once
more
;
only
at
intervals
a
sigh
*NL*
of
rage
heaved
the
hollows
of
his
chest
.
There
was
neither
shame
nor
*NL*
redness
on
his
face
.
He
was
too
far
from
the
state
of
society
,
and
too
*NL*
near
the
state
of
nature
to
know
what
shame
was
.
Moreover
,
with
such
*NL*
a
degree
of
deformity
,
is
infamy
a
thing
that
can
be
felt
?
But
wrath
,
*NL*
hatred
,
despair
,
slowly
lowered
over
that
hideous
visage
a
cloud
*NL*
which
grew
ever
more
and
more
sombre
,
ever
more
and
more
charged
with
*NL*
electricity
,
which
burst
forth
in
a
thousand
lightning
flashes
from
the
*NL*
eye
of
the
cyclops
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
that
cloud
cleared
away
for
a
moment
,
at
the
passage
of
*NL*
a
mule
which
traversed
the
crowd
,
bearing
a
priest
.
As
far
away
as
*NL*
he
could
see
that
mule
and
that
priest
,
the
poor
victim
's
visage
grew
*NL*
gentler
.
The
fury
which
had
contracted
it
was
followed
by
a
strange
*NL*
smile
full
of
ineffable
sweetness
,
gentleness
,
and
tenderness
.
In
*NL*
proportion
as
the
priest
approached
,
that
smile
became
more
clear
,
more
*NL*
distinct
,
more
radiant
.
It
was
like
the
arrival
of
a
Saviour
,
which
the
*NL*
unhappy
man
was
greeting
.
But
as
soon
as
the
mule
was
near
enough
to
the
*NL*
pillory
to
allow
of
its
rider
recognizing
the
victim
,
the
priest
dropped
*NL*
his
eyes
,
beat
a
hasty
retreat
,
spurred
on
rigorously
,
as
though
in
*NL*
haste
to
rid
himself
of
humiliating
appeals
,
and
not
at
all
desirous
of
*NL*
being
saluted
and
recognized
by
a
poor
fellow
in
such
a
predicament
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
priest
was
Archdeacon
Dom
Claude
Frollo
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cloud
descended
more
blackly
than
ever
upon
Quasimodo
's
brow
.
The
*NL*
smile
was
still
mingled
with
it
for
a
time
,
but
was
bitter
,
discouraged
,
*NL*
profoundly
sad
.
*NL*
*NL*
Time
passed
on
.
He
had
been
there
at
least
an
hour
and
a
half
,
*NL*
lacerated
,
maltreated
,
mocked
incessantly
,
and
almost
stoned
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
he
moved
again
in
his
chains
with
redoubled
despair
,
which
*NL*
made
the
whole
framework
that
bore
him
tremble
,
and
,
breaking
the
*NL*
silence
which
he
had
obstinately
preserved
hitherto
,
he
cried
in
a
*NL*
hoarse
and
furious
voice
,
which
resembled
a
bark
rather
than
a
human
*NL*
cry
,
and
which
was
drowned
in
the
noise
of
the
hoots
--
``
Drink
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
exclamation
of
distress
,
far
from
exciting
compassion
,
only
added
*NL*
amusement
to
the
good
Parisian
populace
who
surrounded
the
ladder
,
and
*NL*
who
,
it
must
be
confessed
,
taken
in
the
mass
and
as
a
multitude
,
was
*NL*
then
no
less
cruel
and
brutal
than
that
horrible
tribe
of
robbers
among
*NL*
whom
we
have
already
conducted
the
reader
,
and
which
was
simply
the
*NL*
lower
stratum
of
the
populace
.
Not
a
voice
was
raised
around
the
unhappy
*NL*
victim
,
except
to
jeer
at
his
thirst
.
It
is
certain
that
at
that
moment
*NL*
he
was
more
grotesque
and
repulsive
than
pitiable
,
with
his
face
purple
*NL*
and
dripping
,
his
eye
wild
,
his
mouth
foaming
with
rage
and
pain
,
and
*NL*
his
tongue
lolling
half
out
.
It
must
also
be
stated
that
if
a
charitable
*NL*
soul
of
a
bourgeois
or
_
bourgeoise
_
,
in
the
rabble
,
had
attempted
to
*NL*
carry
a
glass
of
water
to
that
wretched
creature
in
torment
,
there
*NL*
reigned
around
the
infamous
steps
of
the
pillory
such
a
prejudice
of
*NL*
shame
and
ignominy
,
that
it
would
have
sufficed
to
repulse
the
good
*NL*
Samaritan
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
expiration
of
a
few
moments
,
Quasimodo
cast
a
desperate
glance
*NL*
upon
the
crowd
,
and
repeated
in
a
voice
still
more
heartrending
:
*NL*
``
Drink
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
all
began
to
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Drink
this
!
''
cried
Robin
Poussepain
,
throwing
in
his
face
a
sponge
*NL*
which
had
been
soaked
in
the
gutter
.
``
There
,
you
deaf
villain
,
I
'm
your
*NL*
debtor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
woman
hurled
a
stone
at
his
head
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
teach
you
to
wake
us
up
at
night
with
your
peal
of
a
dammed
*NL*
soul
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
,
good
,
my
son
!
''
howled
a
cripple
,
making
an
effort
to
reach
him
with
*NL*
his
crutch
,
``
will
you
cast
any
more
spells
on
us
from
the
top
of
the
*NL*
towers
of
Notre-Dame
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
's
a
drinking
cup
!
''
chimed
in
a
man
,
flinging
a
broken
jug
at
his
*NL*
breast
.
''
'T
was
you
that
made
my
wife
,
simply
because
she
passed
near
*NL*
you
,
give
birth
to
a
child
with
two
heads
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
my
cat
bring
forth
a
kitten
with
six
paws
!
''
yelped
an
old
crone
,
*NL*
launching
a
brick
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Drink
!
''
repeated
Quasimodo
panting
,
and
for
the
third
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
he
beheld
the
crowd
give
way
.
A
young
girl
,
fantastically
*NL*
dressed
,
emerged
from
the
throng
.
She
was
accompanied
by
a
little
white
*NL*
goat
with
gilded
horns
,
and
carried
a
tambourine
in
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Quasimodo
's
eyes
sparkled
.
It
was
the
gypsy
whom
he
had
attempted
to
*NL*
carry
off
on
the
preceding
night
,
a
misdeed
for
which
he
was
dimly
*NL*
conscious
that
he
was
being
punished
at
that
very
moment
;
which
was
*NL*
not
in
the
least
the
case
,
since
he
was
being
chastised
only
for
the
*NL*
misfortune
of
being
deaf
,
and
of
having
been
judged
by
a
deaf
man
.
He
*NL*
doubted
not
that
she
had
come
to
wreak
her
vengeance
also
,
and
to
deal
*NL*
her
blow
like
the
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
beheld
her
,
in
fact
,
mount
the
ladder
rapidly
.
Wrath
and
spite
*NL*
suffocate
him
.
He
would
have
liked
to
make
the
pillory
crumble
into
*NL*
ruins
,
and
if
the
lightning
of
his
eye
could
have
dealt
death
,
the
gypsy
*NL*
would
have
been
reduced
to
powder
before
she
reached
the
platform
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
approached
,
without
uttering
a
syllable
,
the
victim
who
writhed
in
*NL*
a
vain
effort
to
escape
her
,
and
detaching
a
gourd
from
her
girdle
,
she
*NL*
raised
it
gently
to
the
parched
lips
of
the
miserable
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
from
that
eye
which
had
been
,
up
to
that
moment
,
so
dry
and
*NL*
burning
,
a
big
tear
was
seen
to
fall
,
and
roll
slowly
down
that
deformed
*NL*
visage
so
long
contracted
with
despair
.
It
was
the
first
,
in
all
*NL*
probability
,
that
the
unfortunate
man
had
ever
shed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
he
had
forgotten
to
drink
.
The
gypsy
made
her
little
pout
,
*NL*
from
impatience
,
and
pressed
the
spout
to
the
tusked
month
of
Quasimodo
,
*NL*
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
drank
with
deep
draughts
.
His
thirst
was
burning
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
finished
,
the
wretch
protruded
his
black
lips
,
no
doubt
,
*NL*
with
the
object
of
kissing
the
beautiful
hand
which
had
just
succoured
*NL*
him
.
But
the
young
girl
,
who
was
,
perhaps
,
somewhat
distrustful
,
and
who
*NL*
remembered
the
violent
attempt
of
the
night
,
withdrew
her
hand
with
the
*NL*
frightened
gesture
of
a
child
who
is
afraid
of
being
bitten
by
a
beast
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
poor
deaf
man
fixed
on
her
a
look
full
of
reproach
and
*NL*
inexpressible
sadness
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
have
been
a
touching
spectacle
anywhere
,
--
this
beautiful
,
*NL*
fresh
,
pure
,
and
charming
girl
,
who
was
at
the
same
time
so
weak
,
thus
*NL*
hastening
to
the
relief
of
so
much
misery
,
deformity
,
and
malevolence
.
*NL*
On
the
pillory
,
the
spectacle
was
sublime
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
very
populace
were
captivated
by
it
,
and
began
to
clap
their
hands
,
*NL*
crying
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Noel
!
Noel
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
at
that
moment
that
the
recluse
caught
sight
,
from
the
window
of
*NL*
her
bole
,
of
the
gypsy
on
the
pillory
,
and
hurled
at
her
her
sinister
*NL*
imprecation
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Accursed
be
thou
,
daughter
of
Egypt
!
Accursed
!
accursed
!

*NL*
*NL*
La
Esmeralda
turned
pale
and
descended
from
the
pillory
,
staggering
as
*NL*
she
went
.
The
voice
of
the
recluse
still
pursued
her
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Descend
!
descend
!
Thief
of
Egypt
!
thou
shalt
ascend
it

more
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
sacked
nun

tantrums

''
muttered
the
populace
;
*NL*
and
that
was
the
end
of
it
.
For
that
sort
of
woman
was
feared
;
which
*NL*
rendered
them
sacred
.
People
did
not
then
willingly
attack
one
who
*NL*
prayed
day
and
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hour
had
arrived
for
removing
Quasimodo
.
He
was
unbound
,
the
crowd
*NL*
dispersed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Near
the
Grand
Pont
,
Mahiette
,
who
was
returning
with
her
two
*NL*
companions
,
suddenly
halted
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
way
,
Eustache
!
what
did
you
do
with
that
cake
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother

said
the
child
,
``
while
you
were
talking
with
that
lady
in
the
*NL*
bole

a
big
dog
took
a
bite

I
bit
it
also

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
sir

did
you
eat

whole
of
it

she
went
on

*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
,
it
was
the
dog

I
told
him
,
but
he
would
not
listen

me

Then
*NL*
I
bit
into
it
,
also
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
a
terrible
child
!

said
the
mother
,
smiling
and
scolding
at
one
*NL*
and
the
same
time
.
``
Do
you
see

Oudarde

He
already

THE
DANGER
OF
CONFIDING
ONE
'S
SECRET
TO
A
GOAT
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Many
weeks
had
elapsed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
of
March
had
arrived
.
The
sun
,
which
Dubartas
,
that
classic
*NL*
ancestor
of
periphrase
,
had
not
yet
dubbed
the
``
Grand-duke
of
Candles
,
''
*NL*
was
none
the
less
radiant
and
joyous
on
that
account
.
It
was
one
of
*NL*
those
spring
days
which
possesses
so
much
sweetness
and
beauty
,
that
all
*NL*
Paris
turns
out
into
the
squares
and
promenades
and
celebrates
them
*NL*
as
though
they
were
Sundays
.
In
those
days
of
brilliancy
,
warmth
,
and
*NL*
serenity
,
there
is
a
certain
hour
above
all
others
,
when
the
facade
of
*NL*
Notre-Dame
should
be
admired
.
It
is
the
moment
when
the
sun
,
already
*NL*
declining
towards
the
west
,
looks
the
cathedral
almost
full
in
the
face
.
*NL*
Its
rays
,
growing
more
and
more
horizontal
,
withdraw
slowly
from
the
*NL*
pavement
of
the
square
,
and
mount
up
the
perpendicular
facade
,
whose
*NL*
thousand
bosses
in
high
relief
they
cause
to
start
out
from
the
shadows
,
*NL*
while
the
great
central
rose
window
flames
like
the
eye
of
a
cyclops
,
*NL*
inflamed
with
the
reflections
of
the
forge
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Opposite
the
lofty
cathedral
,
reddened
by
the
setting
sun
,
on
the
stone
*NL*
balcony
built
above
the
porch
of
a
rich
Gothic
house
,
which
formed
the
*NL*
angle
of
the
square
and
the
Rue
du
Parvis
,
several
young
girls
were
*NL*
laughing
and
chatting
with
every
sort
of
grace
and
mirth
.
From
the
*NL*
length
of
the
veil
which
fell
from
their
pointed
coif
,
twined
with
*NL*
pearls
,
to
their
heels
,
from
the
fineness
of
the
embroidered
chemisette
*NL*
which
covered
their
shoulders
and
allowed
a
glimpse
,
according
to
the
*NL*
pleasing
custom
of
the
time
,
of
the
swell
of
their
fair
virgin
bosoms
,
*NL*
from
the
opulence
of
their
under-petticoats
still
more
precious
than
*NL*
their
overdress
-LRB-
marvellous
refinement
-RRB-
,
from
the
gauze
,
the
silk
,
*NL*
the
velvet
,
with
which
all
this
was
composed
,
and
,
above
all
,
from
the
*NL*
whiteness
of
their
hands
,
which
certified
to
their
leisure
and
idleness
,
*NL*
it
was
easy
to
divine
they
were
noble
and
wealthy
heiresses
.
They
were
,
*NL*
in
fact
,
Damoiselle
Fleur-de-Lys
de
Gondelaurier
and
her
companions
,
*NL*
Diane
de
Christeuil
,
Amelotte
de
Montmichel
,
Colombe
de
Gaillefontaine
,
*NL*
and
the
little
de
Champchevrier
maiden
;
all
damsels
of
good
birth
,
*NL*
assembled
at
that
moment
at
the
house
of
the
dame
widow
de
Gondelaurier
,
*NL*
on
account
of
Monseigneur
de
Beaujeu
and
Madame
his
wife
,
who
were
to
*NL*
come
to
Paris
in
the
month
of
April
,
there
to
choose
maids
of
honor
for
*NL*
the
Dauphiness
Marguerite
,
who
was
to
be
received
in
Picardy
from
the
*NL*
hands
of
the
Flemings
.
Now
,
all
the
squires
for
twenty
leagues
around
*NL*
were
intriguing
for
this
favor
for
their
daughters
,
and
a
goodly
number
*NL*
of
the
latter
had
been
already
brought
or
sent
to
Paris
.
These
four
*NL*
maidens
had
been
confided
to
the
discreet
and
venerable
charge
of
*NL*
Madame
Aloise
de
Gondelaurier
,
widow
of
a
former
commander
of
the
king
's
*NL*
cross-bowmen
,
who
had
retired
with
her
only
daughter
to
her
house
in
the
*NL*
Place
du
Parvis
,
Notre-Dame
,
in
Paris
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
balcony
on
which
these
young
girls
stood
opened
from
a
chamber
*NL*
richly
tapestried
in
fawn-colored
Flanders
leather
,
stamped
with
golden
*NL*
foliage
.
The
beams
,
which
cut
the
ceiling
in
parallel
lines
,
diverted
*NL*
the
eye
with
a
thousand
eccentric
painted
and
gilded
carvings
.
Splendid
*NL*
enamels
gleamed
here
and
there
on
carved
chests
;
a
boar
's
head
in
*NL*
faience
crowned
a
magnificent
dresser
,
whose
two
shelves
announced
that
*NL*
the
mistress
of
the
house
was
the
wife
or
widow
of
a
knight
banneret
.
At
*NL*
the
end
of
the
room
,
by
the
side
of
a
lofty
chimney
blazoned
with
*NL*
arms
from
top
to
bottom
,
in
a
rich
red
velvet
arm-chair
,
sat
Dame
de
*NL*
Gondelaurier
,
whose
five
and
fifty
years
were
written
upon
her
garments
*NL*
no
less
distinctly
than
upon
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beside
her
stood
a
young
man
of
imposing
mien
,
although
partaking
*NL*
somewhat
of
vanity
and
bravado
--
one
of
those
handsome
fellows
whom
all
*NL*
women
agree
to
admire
,
although
grave
men
learned
in
physiognomy
shrug
*NL*
their
shoulders
at
them
.
This
young
man
wore
the
garb
of
a
captain
of
*NL*
the
king
's
unattached
archers
,
which
bears
far
too
much
resemblance
to
*NL*
the
costume
of
Jupiter
,
which
the
reader
has
already
been
enabled
to
*NL*
admire
in
the
first
book
of
this
history
,
for
us
to
inflict
upon
him
a
*NL*
second
description
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
damoiselles
were
seated
,
a
part
in
the
chamber
,
a
part
in
the
*NL*
balcony
,
some
on
square
cushions
of
Utrecht
velvet
with
golden
corners
,
*NL*
others
on
stools
of
oak
carved
in
flowers
and
figures
.
Each
of
them
held
*NL*
on
her
knee
a
section
of
a
great
needlework
tapestry
,
on
which
they
*NL*
were
working
in
company
,
while
one
end
of
it
lay
upon
the
rush
mat
which
*NL*
covered
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
chatting
together
in
that
whispering
tone
and
with
the
*NL*
half-stifled
laughs
peculiar
to
an
assembly
of
young
girls
in
whose
*NL*
midst
there
is
a
young
man
.
The
young
man
whose
presence
served
to
set
*NL*
in
play
all
these
feminine
self-conceits
,
appeared
to
pay
very
little
*NL*
heed
to
the
matter
,
and
,
while
these
pretty
damsels
were
vying
with
one
*NL*
another
to
attract
his
attention
,
he
seemed
to
be
chiefly
absorbed
in
*NL*
polishing
the
buckle
of
his
sword
belt
with
his
doeskin
glove
.
From
time
*NL*
to
time
,
the
old
lady
addressed
him
in
a
very
low
tone
,
and
he
*NL*
replied
as
well
as
he
was
able
,
with
a
sort
of
awkward
and
constrained
*NL*
politeness
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
smiles
and
significant
gestures
of
Dame
Aloise
,
from
the
*NL*
glances
which
she
threw
towards
her
daughter
,
Fleur-de-Lys
,
as
she
spoke
*NL*
low
to
the
captain
,
it
was
easy
to
see
that
there
was
here
a
question
of
*NL*
some
betrothal
concluded
,
some
marriage
near
at
hand
no
doubt
,
between
*NL*
the
young
man
and
Fleur-de-Lys
.
From
the
embarrassed
coldness
of
the
*NL*
officer
,
it
was
easy
to
see
that
on
his
side
,
at
least
,
love
had
*NL*
no
longer
any
part
in
the
matter
.
His
whole
air
was
expressive
of
*NL*
constraint
and
weariness
,
which
our
lieutenants
of
the
garrison
would
*NL*
to-day
translate
admirably
as
,
``
What
a
beastly
bore
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
dame
,
very
much
infatuated
with
her
daughter
,
like
any
other
*NL*
silly
mother
,
did
not
perceive
the
officer
's
lack
of
enthusiasm
,
and
*NL*
strove
in
low
tones
to
call
his
attention
to
the
infinite
grace
with
*NL*
which
Fleur-de-Lys
used
her
needle
or
wound
her
skein
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
little
cousin
,
''
she
said
to
him
,
plucking
him
by
the
sleeve
,
in
*NL*
order
to
speak
in
his
ear
,
``
Look
at
her
,
do
!
see
her
stoop
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
truly
,
''
replied
the
young
man
,
and
fell
back
into
his
glacial
and
*NL*
absent-minded
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
moment
later
,
he
was
obliged
to
bend
down
again
,
and
Dame
Aloise
said
*NL*
to
him
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
ever
beheld
a
more
gay
and
charming
face
than
that
of
your
*NL*
betrothed
?
Can
one
be
more
white
and
blonde
?
are
not
her
hands
perfect
?
*NL*
and
that
neck
--
does
it
not
assume
all
the
curves
of
the
swan
in
*NL*
ravishing
fashion
?
How
I
envy
you
at
times
!
and
how
happy
you
are
to
be
*NL*
a
man
,
naughty
libertine
that
you
are
!
Is
not
my
Fleur-de-Lys
adorably
*NL*
beautiful
,
and
are
you
not
desperately
in
love
with
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
''
he
replied
,
still
thinking
of
something
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
do
say
something
,
''
said
Madame
Aloise
,
suddenly
giving
his
shoulder
*NL*
a
push
;
``
you
have
grown
very
timid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
can
assure
our
readers
that
timidity
was
neither
the
captain
's
virtue
*NL*
nor
his
defect
.
But
he
made
an
effort
to
do
what
was
demanded
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fair
cousin
,
''
he
said
,
approaching
Fleur-de-Lys
,
``
what
is
the
subject
*NL*
of
this
tapestry
work
which
you
are
fashioning
?
''
``
Fair
cousin
,
''
*NL*
responded
Fleur-de-Lys
,
in
an
offended
tone
,
``
I
have
already
told
you
*NL*
three
times
.
'T
is
the
grotto
of
Neptune
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
evident
that
Fleur-de-Lys
saw
much
more
clearly
than
her
mother
*NL*
through
the
captain
's
cold
and
absent-minded
manner
.
He
felt
the
*NL*
necessity
of
making
some
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
for
whom
is
this
Neptunerie
destined
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
the
Abbey
of
Saint-Antoine
des
Champs
,
''
answered
Fleur-de-Lys
,
*NL*
without
raising
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
took
up
a
corner
of
the
tapestry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
,
my
fair
cousin
,
is
this
big
gendarme
,
who
is
puffing
out
his
*NL*
cheeks
to
their
full
extent
and
blowing
a
trumpet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
Triton
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
rather
pettish
intonation
in
Fleur-de-Lys
's
--
laconic
words
.
*NL*
The
young
man
understood
that
it
was
indispensable
that
he
should
*NL*
whisper
something
in
her
ear
,
a
commonplace
,
a
gallant
compliment
,
no
*NL*
matter
what
.
Accordingly
he
bent
down
,
but
he
could
find
nothing
in
his
*NL*
imagination
more
tender
and
personal
than
this
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
does
your
mother
always
wear
that
surcoat
with
armorial
designs
,
*NL*
like
our
grandmothers
of
the
time
of
Charles
VII
.
?
Tell
her
,
fair
*NL*
cousin
,
that
't
is
no
longer
the
fashion
,
and
that
the
hinge
-LRB-
gond
-RRB-
*NL*
and
the
laurel
-LRB-
laurier
-RRB-
embroidered
on
her
robe
give
her
the
air
of
*NL*
a
walking
mantlepiece
.
In
truth
,
people
no
longer
sit
thus
on
their
*NL*
banners
,
I
assure
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fleur-de-Lys
raised
her
beautiful
eyes
,
full
of
reproach
,
``
Is
that
all
*NL*
of
which
you
can
assure
me
?
''
she
said
,
in
a
low
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
Dame
Aloise
,
delighted
to
see
them
thus
bending
towards
*NL*
each
other
and
whispering
,
said
as
she
toyed
with
the
clasps
of
her
*NL*
prayer-book
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Touching
picture
of
love
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
,
more
and
more
embarrassed
,
fell
back
upon
the
subject
of
*NL*
the
tapestry
,
--
''
'T
is
,
in
sooth
,
a
charming
work
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whereupon
Colombe
de
Gaillefontaine
,
another
beautiful
blonde
,
with
a
*NL*
white
skin
,
dressed
to
the
neck
in
blue
damask
,
ventured
a
timid
remark
*NL*
which
she
addressed
to
Fleur-de-Lys
,
in
the
hope
that
the
handsome
*NL*
captain
would
reply
to
it
,
``
My
dear
Gondelaurier
,
have
you
seen
the
*NL*
tapestries
of
the
Hotel
de
la
Roche-Guyon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
not
that
the
hotel
in
which
is
enclosed
the
garden
of
the
Lingere
*NL*
du
Louvre
?
''
asked
Diane
de
Christeuil
with
a
laugh
;
for
she
had
handsome
*NL*
teeth
,
and
consequently
laughed
on
every
occasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
where
there
is
that
big
,
old
tower
of
the
ancient
wall
of
Paris
,
''
*NL*
added
Amelotte
de
Montmichel
,
a
pretty
fresh
and
curly-headed
brunette
,
*NL*
who
had
a
habit
of
sighing
just
as
the
other
laughed
,
without
knowing
*NL*
why
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Colombe
,
''
interpolated
Dame
Aloise
,
``
do
you
not
mean
the
hotel
*NL*
which
belonged
to
Monsieur
de
Bacqueville
,
in
the
reign
of
King
Charles
*NL*
VI

?
there
are
indeed
many
superb
high
warp
tapestries
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Charles

!
Charles
VI

!
''
muttered
the
young
captain
,
twirling
his
*NL*
moustache
.
``
Good
heavens
!
what
old
things
the
good
dame
does
remember
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Gondelaurier
continued
,
``
Fine
tapestries
,
in
truth
.
A
work
so
*NL*
esteemed
that
it
passes
as
unrivalled
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
Berangere
de
Champchevrier
,
a
slender
little
maid
of
*NL*
seven
years
,
who
was
peering
into
the
square
through
the
trefoils
of
*NL*
the
balcony
,
exclaimed
,
``
Oh
!
look
,
fair
Godmother
Fleur-de-Lys
,
at
that
*NL*
pretty
dancer
who
is
dancing
on
the
pavement
and
playing
the
tambourine
*NL*
in
the
midst
of
the
loutish
bourgeois
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sonorous
vibration
of
a
tambourine
was
,
in
fact
,
audible
.
``
Some
*NL*
gypsy
from
Bohemia
,
''
said
Fleur-de-Lys
,
turning
carelessly
toward
the
*NL*
square
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
!
look
!
''
exclaimed
her
lively
companions
;
and
they
all
ran
to
the
*NL*
edge
of
the
balcony
,
while
Fleur-de-Lys
,
rendered
thoughtful
by
the
*NL*
coldness
of
her
betrothed
,
followed
them
slowly
,
and
the
latter
,
*NL*
relieved
by
this
incident
,
which
put
an
end
to
an
embarrassing
*NL*
conversation
,
retreated
to
the
farther
end
of
the
room
,
with
the
*NL*
satisfied
air
of
a
soldier
released
from
duty
.
Nevertheless
,
the
*NL*
fair
Fleur-de-Lys
's
was
a
charming
and
noble
service
,
and
such
it
had
*NL*
formerly
appeared
to
him
;
but
the
captain
had
gradually
become
blase
'
;
*NL*
the
prospect
of
a
speedy
marriage
cooled
him
more
every
day
.
Moreover
,
*NL*
he
was
of
a
fickle
disposition
,
and
,
must
we
say
it
,
rather
vulgar
in
*NL*
taste
.
Although
of
very
noble
birth
,
he
had
contracted
in
his
official
*NL*
harness
more
than
one
habit
of
the
common
trooper
.
The
tavern
and
its
*NL*
accompaniments
pleased
him
.
He
was
only
at
his
ease
amid
gross
language
,
*NL*
military
gallantries
,
facile
beauties
,
and
successes
yet
more
easy
.
*NL*
He
had
,
nevertheless
,
received
from
his
family
some
education
and
some
*NL*
politeness
of
manner
;
but
he
had
been
thrown
on
the
world
too
young
,
he
*NL*
had
been
in
garrison
at
too
early
an
age
,
and
every
day
the
polish
of
*NL*
a
gentleman
became
more
and
more
effaced
by
the
rough
friction
of
his
*NL*
gendarme
's
cross-belt
.
While
still
continuing
to
visit
her
from
time
to
*NL*
time
,
from
a
remnant
of
common
respect
,
he
felt
doubly
embarrassed
with
*NL*
Fleur-de-Lys
;
in
the
first
place
,
because
,
in
consequence
of
having
*NL*
scattered
his
love
in
all
sorts
of
places
,
he
had
reserved
very
little
*NL*
for
her
;
in
the
next
place
,
because
,
amid
so
many
stiff
,
formal
,
and
*NL*
decent
ladies
,
he
was
in
constant
fear
lest
his
mouth
,
habituated
to
*NL*
oaths
,
should
suddenly
take
the
bit
in
its
teeth
,
and
break
out
into
the
*NL*
language
of
the
tavern
.
The
effect
can
be
imagined
!
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
all
this
was
mingled
in
him
,
with
great
pretentions
to
*NL*
elegance
,
toilet
,
and
a
fine
appearance
.
Let
the
reader
reconcile
these
*NL*
things
as
best
he
can
.
I
am
simply
the
historian
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
remained
,
therefore
,
for
several
minutes
,
leaning
in
silence
*NL*
against
the
carved
jamb
of
the
chimney
,
and
thinking
or
not
thinking
,
*NL*
when
Fleur-de-Lys
suddenly
turned
and
addressed
him
.
After
all
,
the
poor
*NL*
young
girl
was
pouting
against
the
dictates
of
her
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fair
cousin
,
did
you
not
speak
to
us
of
a
little
Bohemian
whom
you
*NL*
saved
a
couple
of
months
ago
,
while
making
the
patrol
with
the
watch
at
*NL*
night
,
from
the
hands
of
a
dozen
robbers
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
so
,
fair
cousin
,
''
said
the
captain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
she
resumed
,
``
perchance
't
is
that
same
gypsy
girl
who
is
dancing
*NL*
yonder
,
on
the
church
square
.
Come
and
see
if
you
recognize
her
,
fair
*NL*
Cousin
Phoebus
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
secret
desire
for
reconciliation
was
apparent
in
this
gentle
*NL*
invitation
which
she
gave
him
to
approach
her
,
and
in
the
care
which
she
*NL*
took
to
call
him
by
name
.
Captain
Phoebus
de
Chateaupers
-LRB-
for
it
is
*NL*
he
whom
the
reader
has
had
before
his
eyes
since
the
beginning
of
this
*NL*
chapter
-RRB-
slowly
approached
the
balcony
.
``
Stay
,
''
said
Fleur-de-Lys
,
*NL*
laying
her
hand
tenderly
on
Phoebus
's
arm
;
``
look
at
that
little
girl
*NL*
yonder
,
dancing
in
that
circle
.
Is
she
your
Bohemian
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Phoebus
looked
,
and
said
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
recognize
her
by
her
goat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
in
fact
,
what
a
pretty
little
goat
!
''
said
Amelotte
,
clasping
her
*NL*
hands
in
admiration
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
his
horns
of
real
gold
?
''
inquired
Berangere
.
*NL*
*NL*
Without
moving
from
her
arm-chair
,
Dame
Aloise
interposed
,
``
Is
she
not
*NL*
one
of
those
gypsy
girls
who
arrived
last
year
by
the
Gibard
gate
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
my
mother
,
''
said
Fleur-de-Lys
gently
,
``
that
gate
is
now
called
*NL*
the
Porte
d'Enfer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mademoiselle
de
Gondelaurier
knew
how
her
mother
's
antiquated
mode
of
*NL*
speech
shocked
the
captain
.
In
fact
,
he
began
to
sneer
,
and
muttered
*NL*
between
his
teeth
:
``
Porte
Gibard
!
Porte
Gibard
!
'T
is
enough
to
make
King
*NL*
Charles
VI
.
pass
by
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Godmother
!
''
exclaimed
Berangere
,
whose
eyes
,
incessantly
in
motion
,
had
*NL*
suddenly
been
raised
to
the
summit
of
the
towers
of
Notre-Dame
,
``
who
is
*NL*
that
black
man
up
yonder
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
young
girls
raised
their
eyes
.
A
man
was
,
in
truth
,
leaning
*NL*
on
the
balustrade
which
surmounted
the
northern
tower
,
looking
on
the
*NL*
Greve
.
He
was
a
priest
.
His
costume
could
be
plainly
discerned
,
and
his
*NL*
face
resting
on
both
his
hands
.
But
he
stirred
no
more
than
if
he
had
*NL*
been
a
statue
.
His
eyes
,
intently
fixed
,
gazed
into
the
Place
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
something
like
the
immobility
of
a
bird
of
prey
,
who
has
just
*NL*
discovered
a
nest
of
sparrows
,
and
is
gazing
at
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
monsieur
the
archdeacon
of
Josas
,
''
said
Fleur-de-Lys
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
good
eyes
if
you
can
recognize
him
from
here
,
''
said
the
*NL*
Gaillefontaine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
he
is
staring
at
the
little
dancer

went
on
Diane
de
Christeuil
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
the
gypsy
beware
!
''
said
Fleur-de-Lys
,
``
for
he
loves
not
Egypt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
a
great
shame
for
that
man
to
look
upon
her
thus
,
''
added
Amelotte
*NL*
de
Montmichel
,
``
for
she
dances
delightfully
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fair
cousin
Phoebus
,
''
said
Fleur-de-Lys
suddenly
,
``
Since
you
know
this
*NL*
little
gypsy
,
make
her
a
sign
to
come
up
here

It
will
amuse
us

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes

''
exclaimed
all
the
young
girls
,
clapping
their
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
!
't
is
not
worth
while
,
''
replied
Phoebus
.
``
She
has
forgotten
me
,
no
*NL*
doubt
,
and
I
know
not
so
much
as
her
name

Nevertheless
,
as
you
wish
it
,
*NL*
young
ladies
,
I
will
make
the
trial
.
''
And
leaning
over
the
balustrade
of
*NL*
the
balcony
,
he
began
to
shout
,
``
Little
one
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
dancer
was
not
beating
her
tambourine
at
the
moment
.
She
turned
her
*NL*
head
towards
the
point
whence
this
call
proceeded
,
her
brilliant
eyes
*NL*
rested
on
Phoebus
,
and
she
stopped
short
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Little
one
!
''
repeated
the
captain
;
and
he
beckoned
her
to
approach
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
girl
looked
at
him
again
,
then
she
blushed
as
though
a
flame
*NL*
had
mounted
into
her
cheeks
,
and
,
taking
her
tambourine
under
her
arm
,
*NL*
she
made
her
way
through
the
astonished
spectators
towards
the
door
of
*NL*
the
house
where
Phoebus
was
calling
her
,
with
slow
,
tottering
steps
,
and
*NL*
with
the
troubled
look
of
a
bird
which
is
yielding
to
the
fascination
of
*NL*
a
serpent
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
moment
later
,
the
tapestry
portiere
was
raised
,
and
the
gypsy
appeared
*NL*
on
the
threshold
of
the
chamber
,
blushing
,
confused
,
breathless
,
her
*NL*
large
eyes
drooping
,
and
not
daring
to
advance
another
step
.
*NL*
*NL*
Berangere
clapped
her
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
the
dancer
remained
motionless
upon
the
threshold
.
Her
*NL*
appearance
had
produced
a
singular
effect
upon
these
young
girls
.
It
*NL*
is
certain
that
a
vague
and
indistinct
desire
to
please
the
handsome
*NL*
officer
animated
them
all
,
that
his
splendid
uniform
was
the
target
of
*NL*
all
their
coquetries
,
and
that
from
the
moment
he
presented
himself
,
*NL*
there
existed
among
them
a
secret
,
suppressed
rivalry
,
which
they
hardly
*NL*
acknowledged
even
to
themselves
,
but
which
broke
forth
,
none
the
less
,
*NL*
every
instant
,
in
their
gestures
and
remarks
.
Nevertheless
,
as
they
were
*NL*
all
very
nearly
equal
in
beauty
,
they
contended
with
equal
arms
,
and
*NL*
each
could
hope
for
the
victory
.
--
The
arrival
of
the
gypsy
suddenly
*NL*
destroyed
this
equilibrium
.
Her
beauty
was
so
rare
,
that
,
at
the
moment
*NL*
when
she
appeared
at
the
entrance
of
the
apartment
,
it
seemed
as
though
*NL*
she
diffused
a
sort
of
light
which
was
peculiar
to
herself
.
In
that
*NL*
narrow
chamber
,
surrounded
by
that
sombre
frame
of
hangings
and
*NL*
woodwork
,
she
was
incomparably
more
beautiful
and
more
radiant
than
on
*NL*
the
public
square
.
She
was
like
a
torch
which
has
suddenly
been
brought
*NL*
from
broad
daylight
into
the
dark
.
The
noble
damsels
were
dazzled
by
her
*NL*
in
spite
of
themselves
.
Each
one
felt
herself
,
in
some
sort
,
wounded
*NL*
in
her
beauty
.
Hence
,
their
battle
front
-LRB-
may
we
be
allowed
the
*NL*
expression
,
-RRB-
was
immediately
altered
,
although
they
exchanged
not
a
*NL*
single
word
.
But
they
understood
each
other
perfectly
.
Women
's
instincts
*NL*
comprehend
and
respond
to
each
other
more
quickly
than
the
intelligences
*NL*
of
men
.
An
enemy
had
just
arrived
;
all
felt
it
--
all
rallied
together
.
*NL*
One
drop
of
wine
is
sufficient
to
tinge
a
glass
of
water
red
;
to
diffuse
*NL*
a
certain
degree
of
ill
temper
throughout
a
whole
assembly
of
pretty
*NL*
women
,
the
arrival
of
a
prettier
woman
suffices
,
especially
when
there
*NL*
is
but
one
man
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hence
the
welcome
accorded
to
the
gypsy
was
marvellously
glacial
.
They
*NL*
surveyed
her
from
head
to
foot
,
then
exchanged
glances
,
and
all
was
*NL*
said
;
they
understood
each
other
.
Meanwhile
,
the
young
girl
was
waiting
*NL*
to
be
spoken
to
,
in
such
emotion
that
she
dared
not
raise
her
eyelids
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
was
the
first
to
break
the
silence
.
``
Upon
my
word
,
''
said
*NL*
he
,
in
his
tone
of
intrepid
fatuity
,
``
here
is
a
charming
creature
!
What
*NL*
think
you
of
her
,
fair
cousin
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
remark
,
which
a
more
delicate
admirer
would
have
uttered
in
a
lower
*NL*
tone
,
at
least
was
not
of
a
nature
to
dissipate
the
feminine
jealousies
*NL*
which
were
on
the
alert
before
the
gypsy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fleur-de-Lys
replied
to
the
captain
with
a
bland
affectation
of
*NL*
disdain
;
--
``
Not
bad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
others
whispered
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
,
Madame
Aloise
,
who
was
not
the
less
jealous
because
she
was
*NL*
so
for
her
daughter
,
addressed
the
dancer
,
--
``
Approach
,
little
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Approach
,
little
one
!
''
repeated
,
with
comical
dignity
,
little
*NL*
Berangere
,
who
would
have
reached
about
as
high
as
her
hips
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gypsy
advanced
towards
the
noble
dame
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fair
child
,
''
said
Phoebus
,
with
emphasis
,
taking
several
steps
towards
*NL*
her
,
``
I
do
not
know
whether
I
have
the
supreme
honor
of
being
recognized
*NL*
by
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
interrupted
him
,
with
a
smile
and
a
look
full
of
infinite
*NL*
sweetness
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
yes
,
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
a
good
memory
,
''
remarked
Fleur-de-Lys
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
now
,
''
resumed
Phoebus
,
``
you
escaped
nimbly
the
other
evening
.
Did
*NL*
I
frighten
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
no
,
''
said
the
gypsy
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
in
the
intonation
of
that
``
Oh
!
no
,
''
uttered
after
that
``
Oh
!
*NL*
yes
,
''
an
ineffable
something
which
wounded
Fleur-de-Lys
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
left
me
in
your
stead
,
my
beauty
,
''
pursued
the
captain
,
whose
*NL*
tongue
was
unloosed
when
speaking
to
a
girl
out
of
the
street
,
``
a
*NL*
crabbed
knave
,
one-eyed
and
hunchbacked
,
the
bishop
's
bellringer
,
*NL*
I
believe
.
I
have
been
told
that
by
birth
he
is
the
bastard
of
*NL*
an
archdeacon
and
a
devil
.
He
has
a
pleasant
name
:
he
is
called
*NL*
_
Quatre-Temps
_
-LRB-
Ember
Days
-RRB-
,
_
Paques-Fleuries
_
-LRB-
Palm
Sunday
-RRB-
,
Mardi-Gras
*NL*
-LRB-
Shrove
Tuesday
-RRB-
,
I
know
not
what
!
The
name
of
some
festival
when
the
*NL*
bells
are
pealed
!
So
he
took
the
liberty
of
carrying
you
off
,
as
though
*NL*
you
were
made
for
beadles
!
'T
is
too
much
.
What
the
devil
did
that
*NL*
screech-owl
want
with
you
?
Hey
,
tell
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
know
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
inconceivable
impudence
!
A
bellringer
carrying
off
a
wench
,
like
a
*NL*
vicomte
!
a
lout
poaching
on
the
game
of
gentlemen
!
that
is
a
rare
piece
*NL*
of
assurance
.
However
,
he
paid
dearly
for
it
.
Master
Pierrat
Torterue
is
*NL*
the
harshest
groom
that
ever
curried
a
knave
;
and
I
can
tell
you
,
if
*NL*
it
will
be
agreeable
to
you
,
that
your
bellringer
's
hide
got
a
thorough
*NL*
dressing
at
his
hands
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
man
!
''
said
the
gypsy
,
in
whom
these
words
revived
the
memory
of
*NL*
the
pillory
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
burst
out
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Corne-de-boeuf
!
here
's
pity
as
well
placed
as
a
feather
in
a
pig
's
*NL*
tail
!
May
I
have
as
big
a
belly
as
a
pope
,
if
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stopped
short
.
``
Pardon
me
,
ladies
;
I
believe
that
I
was
on
the
point
*NL*
of
saying
something
foolish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fie
,
sir
''
said
la
Gaillefontaine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
talks
to
that
creature
in
her
own
tongue
!
''
added
Fleur-de-Lys
,
in
*NL*
a
low
tone
,
her
irritation
increasing
every
moment
.
This
irritation
was
*NL*
not
diminished
when
she
beheld
the
captain
,
enchanted
with
the
gypsy
,
*NL*
and
,
most
of
all
,
with
himself
,
execute
a
pirouette
on
his
heel
,
*NL*
repeating
with
coarse
,
naive
,
and
soldierly
gallantry
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
handsome
wench
,
upon
my
soul
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rather
savagely
dressed
,
''
said
Diane
de
Christeuil
,
laughing
to
show
*NL*
her
fine
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
remark
was
a
flash
of
light
to
the
others
.
Not
being
able
to
impugn
*NL*
her
beauty
,
they
attacked
her
costume
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true
,
''
said
la
Montmichel
;
``
what
makes
you
run
about
the
*NL*
streets
thus
,
without
guimpe
or
ruff
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
petticoat
is
so
short
that
it
makes
one
tremble
,
''
added
la
*NL*
Gaillefontaine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
''
continued
Fleur-de-Lys
,
with
decided
sharpness
,
``
You
will
get
*NL*
yourself
taken
up
by
the
sumptuary
police
for
your
gilded
girdle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Little
one
,
little
one
;
''
resumed
la
Christeuil
,
with
an
implacable
*NL*
smile
,
``
if
you
were
to
put
respectable
sleeves
upon
your
arms
they
would
*NL*
get
less
sunburned
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
,
in
truth
,
a
spectacle
worthy
of
a
more
intelligent
spectator
*NL*
than
Phoebus
,
to
see
how
these
beautiful
maidens
,
with
their
envenomed
*NL*
and
angry
tongues
,
wound
,
serpent-like
,
and
glided
and
writhed
around
*NL*
the
street
dancer
.
They
were
cruel
and
graceful
;
they
searched
and
*NL*
rummaged
maliciously
in
her
poor
and
silly
toilet
of
spangles
and
*NL*
tinsel
.
There
was
no
end
to
their
laughter
,
irony
,
and
humiliation
.
*NL*
Sarcasms
rained
down
upon
the
gypsy
,
and
haughty
condescension
and
*NL*
malevolent
looks
.
One
would
have
thought
they
were
young
Roman
dames
*NL*
thrusting
golden
pins
into
the
breast
of
a
beautiful
slave
.
One
would
*NL*
have
pronounced
them
elegant
grayhounds
,
circling
,
with
inflated
*NL*
nostrils
,
round
a
poor
woodland
fawn
,
whom
the
glance
of
their
master
*NL*
forbade
them
to
devour
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
all
,
what
was
a
miserable
dancer
on
the
public
squares
in
the
*NL*
presence
of
these
high-born
maidens
?
They
seemed
to
take
no
heed
of
her
*NL*
presence
,
and
talked
of
her
aloud
,
to
her
face
,
as
of
something
unclean
,
*NL*
abject
,
and
yet
,
at
the
same
time
,
passably
pretty
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gypsy
was
not
insensible
to
these
pin-pricks
.
From
time
to
time
a
*NL*
flush
of
shame
,
a
flash
of
anger
inflamed
her
eyes
or
her
cheeks
;
with
*NL*
disdain
she
made
that
little
grimace
with
which
the
reader
is
already
*NL*
familiar
,
but
she
remained
motionless
;
she
fixed
on
Phoebus
a
sad
,
*NL*
sweet
,
resigned
look
.
There
was
also
happiness
and
tenderness
in
that
*NL*
gaze
.
One
would
have
said
that
she
endured
for
fear
of
being
expelled
.
*NL*
*NL*
Phoebus
laughed
,
and
took
the
gypsy
's
part
with
a
mixture
of
*NL*
impertinence
and
pity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
them
talk
,
little
one
!
''
he
repeated
,
jingling
his
golden
spurs
.
``
No
*NL*
doubt
your
toilet
is
a
little
extravagant
and
wild
,
but
what
difference
*NL*
does
that
make
with
such
a
charming
damsel
as
yourself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
gracious
!
''
exclaimed
the
blonde
Gaillefontaine
,
drawing
up
her
*NL*
swan-like
throat
,
with
a
bitter
smile
.
``
I
see
that
messieurs
the
archers
*NL*
of
the
king
's
police
easily
take
fire
at
the
handsome
eyes
of
gypsies
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
''
said
Phoebus
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
reply
uttered
carelessly
by
the
captain
,
like
a
stray
stone
,
*NL*
whose
fall
one
does
not
even
watch
,
Colombe
began
to
laugh
,
as
well
as
*NL*
Diane
,
Amelotte
,
and
Fleur-de-Lys
,
into
whose
eyes
at
the
same
time
a
*NL*
tear
started
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gypsy
,
who
had
dropped
her
eyes
on
the
floor
at
the
words
of
Colombe
*NL*
de
Gaillefontaine
,
raised
them
beaming
with
joy
and
pride
and
fixed
them
*NL*
once
more
on
Phoebus
.
She
was
very
beautiful
at
that
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
dame
,
who
was
watching
this
scene
,
felt
offended
,
without
*NL*
understanding
why
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Holy
Virgin
!
''
she
suddenly
exclaimed
,
``
what
is
it
moving
about
my
legs
?
*NL*
Ah
!
the
villanous
beast
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
goat
,
who
had
just
arrived
,
in
search
of
his
mistress
,
and
*NL*
who
,
in
dashing
towards
the
latter
,
had
begun
by
entangling
his
horns
in
*NL*
the
pile
of
stuffs
which
the
noble
dame
's
garments
heaped
up
on
her
feet
*NL*
when
she
was
seated
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
created
a
diversion
.
The
gypsy
disentangled
his
horns
without
*NL*
uttering
a
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
here
's
the
little
goat
with
golden
hoofs
!
''
exclaimed
Berangere
,
*NL*
dancing
with
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gypsy
crouched
down
on
her
knees
and
leaned
her
cheek
against
the
*NL*
fondling
head
of
the
goat
.
One
would
have
said
that
she
was
asking
*NL*
pardon
for
having
quitted
it
thus
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
Diane
had
bent
down
to
Colombe
's
ear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
good
heavens
!
why
did
not
I
think
of
that
sooner
?
'T
is
the
gypsy
*NL*
with
the
goat
.
They
say
she
is
a
sorceress
,
and
that
her
goat
executes
*NL*
very
miraculous
tricks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
said
Colombe
,
``
the
goat
must
now
amuse
us
in
its
turn
,
and
*NL*
perform
a
miracle
for
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Diane
and
Colombe
eagerly
addressed
the
gypsy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Little
one
,
make
your
goat
perform
a
miracle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
know
what
you
mean
,
''
replied
the
dancer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
miracle
,
a
piece
of
magic
,
a
bit
of
sorcery
,
in
short
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
understand
.
''
And
she
fell
to
caressing
the
pretty
animal
,
*NL*
repeating
,
``
Djali
!
Djali
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
Fleur-de-Lys
noticed
a
little
bag
of
embroidered
leather
*NL*
suspended
from
the
neck
of
the
goat
,
--
``
What
is
that
?
''
she
asked
of
the
*NL*
gypsy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gypsy
raised
her
large
eyes
upon
her
and
replied
gravely
,
--
``
That
is
*NL*
my
secret
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
really
like
to
know
what
your
secret
is
,
''
thought
*NL*
Fleur-de-Lys
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
the
good
dame
had
risen
angrily
,
--
``
Come
now
,
gypsy
,
if
*NL*
neither
you
nor
your
goat
can
dance
for
us
,
what
are
you
doing
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
gypsy
walked
slowly
towards
the
door
,
without
making
any
reply
.
*NL*
But
the
nearer
she
approached
it
,
the
more
her
pace
slackened
.
An
*NL*
irresistible
magnet
seemed
to
hold
her
.
Suddenly
she
turned
her
eyes
,
*NL*
wet
with
tears
,
towards
Phoebus
,
and
halted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
God
!
''
exclaimed
the
captain
,
``
that
's
not
the
way
to
depart
.
Come
*NL*
back
and
dance
something
for
us
.
By
the
way
,
my
sweet
love
,
what
is
your
*NL*
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
La
Esmeralda
,
''
said
the
dancer
,
never
taking
her
eyes
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
strange
name
,
a
burst
of
wild
laughter
broke
from
the
young
*NL*
girls
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
's
a
terrible
name
for
a
young
lady
,
''
said
Diane
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
well
enough
,
''
retorted
Amelotte
,
``
that
she
is
an
enchantress
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
''
exclaimed
Dame
Aloise
solemnly
,
``
your
parents
did
not
commit
*NL*
the
sin
of
giving
you
that
name
at
the
baptismal
font
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
several
minutes
previously
,
Berangere
had
coaxed
the
*NL*
goat
into
a
corner
of
the
room
with
a
marchpane
cake
,
without
any
one
*NL*
having
noticed
her
.
In
an
instant
they
had
become
good
friends
.
The
*NL*
curious
child
had
detached
the
bag
from
the
goat
's
neck
,
had
opened
*NL*
it
,
and
had
emptied
out
its
contents
on
the
rush
matting
;
it
was
an
*NL*
alphabet
,
each
letter
of
which
was
separately
inscribed
on
a
tiny
block
*NL*
of
boxwood
.
Hardly
had
these
playthings
been
spread
out
on
the
matting
,
*NL*
when
the
child
,
with
surprise
,
beheld
the
goat
-LRB-
one
of
whose
``
miracles
''
*NL*
this
was
no
doubt
-RRB-
,
draw
out
certain
letters
with
its
golden
hoof
,
and
*NL*
arrange
them
,
with
gentle
pushes
,
in
a
certain
order
.
In
a
moment
they
*NL*
constituted
a
word
,
which
the
goat
seemed
to
have
been
trained
to
write
,
*NL*
so
little
hesitation
did
it
show
in
forming
it
,
and
Berangere
suddenly
*NL*
exclaimed
,
clasping
her
hands
in
admiration
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Godmother
Fleur-de-Lys
,
see
what
the
goat
has
just
done
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fleur-de-Lys
ran
up
and
trembled
.
The
letters
arranged
upon
the
floor
*NL*
formed
this
word
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
PHOEBUS
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
it
the
goat
who
wrote
that
?
''
she
inquired
in
a
changed
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
godmother
,
''
replied
Berangere
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
impossible
to
doubt
it
;
the
child
did
not
know
how
to
write
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
the
secret
!
''
thought
Fleur-de-Lys
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
at
the
child
's
exclamation
,
all
had
hastened
up
,
the
mother
,
*NL*
the
young
girls
,
the
gypsy
,
and
the
officer
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gypsy
beheld
the
piece
of
folly
which
the
goat
had
committed
.
She
*NL*
turned
red
,
then
pale
,
and
began
to
tremble
like
a
culprit
before
the
*NL*
captain
,
who
gazed
at
her
with
a
smile
of
satisfaction
and
amazement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Phoebus
!
''
whispered
the
young
girls
,
stupefied
:
''
't
is
the
captain
's
*NL*
name
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
a
marvellous
memory
!
''
said
Fleur-de-Lys
,
to
the
petrified
*NL*
gypsy
.
Then
,
bursting
into
sobs
:
``
Oh
!
''
she
stammered
mournfully
,
hiding
*NL*
her
face
in
both
her
beautiful
hands
,
``
she
is
a
magician
!
''
And
she
*NL*
heard
another
and
a
still
more
bitter
voice
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
,
*NL*
saying
,
--
``
She
is
a
rival
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
fell
fainting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
daughter
!
my
daughter
!
''
cried
the
terrified
mother
.
``
Begone
,
you
*NL*
gypsy
of
hell
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
twinkling
,
La
Esmeralda
gathered
up
the
unlucky
letters
,
made
a
*NL*
sign
to
Djali
,
and
went
out
through
one
door
,
while
Fleur-de-Lys
was
*NL*
being
carried
out
through
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
Captain
Phoebus
,
on
being
left
alone
,
hesitated
for
a
moment
between
the
*NL*
two
doors
,
then
he
followed
the
gypsy
.

CHAPTER
II
.
A
PRIEST
AND
A
PHILOSOPHER
ARE
TWO
DIFFERENT
THINGS
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
priest
whom
the
young
girls
had
observed
at
the
top
of
the
North
*NL*
tower
,
leaning
over
the
Place
and
so
attentive
to
the
dance
of
the
*NL*
gypsy
,
was
,
in
fact
,
Archdeacon
Claude
Frollo
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
readers
have
not
forgotten
the
mysterious
cell
which
the
archdeacon
*NL*
had
reserved
for
himself
in
that
tower
.
-LRB-
I
do
not
know
,
by
the
way
be
*NL*
it
said
,
whether
it
be
not
the
same
,
the
interior
of
which
can
be
seen
*NL*
to-day
through
a
little
square
window
,
opening
to
the
east
at
the
height
*NL*
of
a
man
above
the
platform
from
which
the
towers
spring
;
a
bare
and
*NL*
dilapidated
den
,
whose
badly
plastered
walls
are
ornamented
here
*NL*
and
there
,
at
the
present
day
,
with
some
wretched
yellow
engravings
*NL*
representing
the
facades
of
cathedrals
.
I
presume
that
this
hole
is
*NL*
jointly
inhabited
by
bats
and
spiders
,
and
that
,
consequently
,
it
wages
*NL*
a
double
war
of
extermination
on
the
flies
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
day
,
an
hour
before
sunset
,
the
archdeacon
ascended
the
staircase
*NL*
to
the
tower
,
and
shut
himself
up
in
this
cell
,
where
he
sometimes
*NL*
passed
whole
nights
.
That
day
,
at
the
moment
when
,
standing
before
the
*NL*
low
door
of
his
retreat
,
he
was
fitting
into
the
lock
the
complicated
*NL*
little
key
which
he
always
carried
about
him
in
the
purse
suspended
to
*NL*
his
side
,
a
sound
of
tambourine
and
castanets
had
reached
his
ear
.
These
*NL*
sounds
came
from
the
Place
du
Parvis
.
The
cell
,
as
we
have
already
said
,
*NL*
had
only
one
window
opening
upon
the
rear
of
the
church
.
Claude
Frollo
*NL*
had
hastily
withdrawn
the
key
,
and
an
instant
later
,
he
was
on
the
top
*NL*
of
the
tower
,
in
the
gloomy
and
pensive
attitude
in
which
the
maidens
*NL*
had
seen
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
he
stood
,
grave
,
motionless
,
absorbed
in
one
look
and
one
thought
.
*NL*
All
Paris
lay
at
his
feet
,
with
the
thousand
spires
of
its
edifices
and
*NL*
its
circular
horizon
of
gentle
hills
--
with
its
river
winding
under
its
*NL*
bridges
,
and
its
people
moving
to
and
fro
through
its
streets
,
--
with
*NL*
the
clouds
of
its
smoke
,
--
with
the
mountainous
chain
of
its
roofs
which
*NL*
presses
Notre-Dame
in
its
doubled
folds
;
but
out
of
all
the
city
,
*NL*
the
archdeacon
gazed
at
one
corner
only
of
the
pavement
,
the
Place
du
*NL*
Parvis
;
in
all
that
throng
at
but
one
figure
,
--
the
gypsy
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
have
been
difficult
to
say
what
was
the
nature
of
this
look
,
*NL*
and
whence
proceeded
the
flame
that
flashed
from
it
.
It
was
a
fixed
*NL*
gaze
,
which
was
,
nevertheless
,
full
of
trouble
and
tumult
.
And
,
from
the
*NL*
profound
immobility
of
his
whole
body
,
barely
agitated
at
intervals
*NL*
by
an
involuntary
shiver
,
as
a
tree
is
moved
by
the
wind
;
from
the
*NL*
stiffness
of
his
elbows
,
more
marble
than
the
balustrade
on
which
*NL*
they
leaned
;
or
the
sight
of
the
petrified
smile
which
contracted
his
*NL*
face
,
--
one
would
have
said
that
nothing
living
was
left
about
Claude
*NL*
Frollo
except
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gypsy
was
dancing
;
she
was
twirling
her
tambourine
on
the
tip
of
her
*NL*
finger
,
and
tossing
it
into
the
air
as
she
danced
Provencal
sarabands
;
*NL*
agile
,
light
,
joyous
,
and
unconscious
of
the
formidable
gaze
which
*NL*
descended
perpendicularly
upon
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
crowd
was
swarming
around
her
;
from
time
to
time
,
a
man
accoutred
in
*NL*
red
and
yellow
made
them
form
into
a
circle
,
and
then
returned
,
seated
*NL*
himself
on
a
chair
a
few
paces
from
the
dancer
,
and
took
the
goat
's
head
*NL*
on
his
knees
.
This
man
seemed
to
be
the
gypsy
's
companion
.
Claude
Frollo
*NL*
could
not
distinguish
his
features
from
his
elevated
post
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
moment
when
the
archdeacon
caught
sight
of
this
stranger
,
his
*NL*
attention
seemed
divided
between
him
and
the
dancer
,
and
his
face
became
*NL*
more
and
more
gloomy
.
All
at
once
he
rose
upright
,
and
a
quiver
ran
*NL*
through
his
whole
body
:
``
Who
is
that
man
?
''
he
muttered
between
his
*NL*
teeth
:
``
I
have
always
seen
her
alone
before
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
plunged
down
beneath
the
tortuous
vault
of
the
spiral
staircase
,
*NL*
and
once
more
descended
.
As
he
passed
the
door
of
the
bell
chamber
,
*NL*
which
was
ajar
,
he
saw
something
which
struck
him
;
he
beheld
Quasimodo
,
*NL*
who
,
leaning
through
an
opening
of
one
of
those
slate
penthouses
which
*NL*
resemble
enormous
blinds
,
appeared
also
to
be
gazing
at
the
Place
.
He
*NL*
was
engaged
in
so
profound
a
contemplation
,
that
he
did
not
notice
the
*NL*
passage
of
his
adopted
father
.
His
savage
eye
had
a
singular
expression
;
*NL*
it
was
a
charmed
,
tender
look
.
``
This
is
strange
!
''
murmured
Claude
.
``
Is
*NL*
it
the
gypsy
at
whom
he
is
thus
gazing
?
''
He
continued
his
descent
.
At
*NL*
the
end
of
a
few
minutes
,
the
anxious
archdeacon
entered
upon
the
Place
*NL*
from
the
door
at
the
base
of
the
tower
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
has
become
of
the
gypsy
girl
?
''
he
said
,
mingling
with
the
group
of
*NL*
spectators
which
the
sound
of
the
tambourine
had
collected
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
not
,
''
replied
one
of
his
neighbors
,
``
I
think
that
she
has
gone
*NL*
to
make
some
of
her
fandangoes
in
the
house
opposite
,
whither
they
have
*NL*
called
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
place
of
the
gypsy
,
on
the
carpet
,
whose
arabesques
had
seemed
to
*NL*
vanish
but
a
moment
previously
by
the
capricious
figures
of
her
dance
,
*NL*
the
archdeacon
no
longer
beheld
any
one
but
the
red
and
yellow
man
,
*NL*
who
,
in
order
to
earn
a
few
testers
in
his
turn
,
was
walking
round
the
*NL*
circle
,
with
his
elbows
on
his
hips
,
his
head
thrown
back
,
his
face
red
,
*NL*
his
neck
outstretched
,
with
a
chair
between
his
teeth
.
To
the
chair
he
*NL*
had
fastened
a
cat
,
which
a
neighbor
had
lent
,
and
which
was
spitting
in
*NL*
great
affright
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Notre-Dame
!
''
exclaimed
the
archdeacon
,
at
the
moment
when
the
juggler
,
*NL*
perspiring
heavily
,
passed
in
front
of
him
with
his
pyramid
of
chair
and
*NL*
his
cat
,
``
What
is
Master
Pierre
Gringoire
doing
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
harsh
voice
of
the
archdeacon
threw
the
poor
fellow
into
such
a
*NL*
commotion
that
he
lost
his
equilibrium
,
together
with
his
whole
edifice
,
*NL*
and
the
chair
and
the
cat
tumbled
pell-mell
upon
the
heads
of
the
*NL*
spectators
,
in
the
midst
of
inextinguishable
hootings
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
probable
that
Master
Pierre
Gringoire
-LRB-
for
it
was
indeed
he
-RRB-
would
*NL*
have
had
a
sorry
account
to
settle
with
the
neighbor
who
owned
the
cat
,
*NL*
and
all
the
bruised
and
scratched
faces
which
surrounded
him
,
if
he
*NL*
had
not
hastened
to
profit
by
the
tumult
to
take
refuge
in
the
church
,
*NL*
whither
Claude
Frollo
had
made
him
a
sign
to
follow
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cathedral
was
already
dark
and
deserted
;
the
side-aisles
were
full
*NL*
of
shadows
,
and
the
lamps
of
the
chapels
began
to
shine
out
like
stars
,
*NL*
so
black
had
the
vaulted
ceiling
become
.
Only
the
great
rose
window
of
*NL*
the
facade
,
whose
thousand
colors
were
steeped
in
a
ray
of
horizontal
*NL*
sunlight
,
glittered
in
the
gloom
like
a
mass
of
diamonds
,
and
threw
its
*NL*
dazzling
reflection
to
the
other
end
of
the
nave
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
had
advanced
a
few
paces
,
Dom
Claude
placed
his
back
against
a
*NL*
pillar
,
and
gazed
intently
at
Gringoire
.
The
gaze
was
not
the
one
which
*NL*
Gringoire
feared
,
ashamed
as
he
was
of
having
been
caught
by
a
grave
and
*NL*
learned
person
in
the
costume
of
a
buffoon
.
There
was
nothing
mocking
or
*NL*
ironical
in
the
priest
's
glance
,
it
was
serious
,
tranquil
,
piercing
.
The
*NL*
archdeacon
was
the
first
to
break
the
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
now
,
Master
Pierre
.
You
are
to
explain
many
things
to
me
.
And
*NL*
first
of
all
,
how
comes
it
that
you
have
not
been
seen
for
two
months
,
*NL*
and
that
now
one
finds
you
in
the
public
squares
,
in
a
fine
equipment
in
*NL*
truth
!
Motley
red
and
yellow
,
like
a
Caudebec
apple
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Messire
,
''
said
Gringoire
,
piteously
,
``
it
is
,
in
fact
,
an
amazing
*NL*
accoutrement
.
You
see
me
no
more
comfortable
in
it
than
a
cat
coiffed
*NL*
with
a
calabash
.
'T
is
very
ill
done
,
I
am
conscious
,
to
expose
messieurs
*NL*
the
sergeants
of
the
watch
to
the
liability
of
cudgelling
beneath
this
*NL*
cassock
the
humerus
of
a
Pythagorean
philosopher
.
But
what
would
you
*NL*
have
,
my
reverend
master
?
't
is
the
fault
of
my
ancient
jerkin
,
which
*NL*
abandoned
me
in
cowardly
wise
,
at
the
beginning
of
the
winter
,
under
the
*NL*
pretext
that
it
was
falling
into
tatters
,
and
that
it
required
repose
in
*NL*
the
basket
of
a
rag-picker
.
What
is
one
to
do
?
Civilization
has
not
yet
*NL*
arrived
at
the
point
where
one
can
go
stark
naked
,
as
ancient
Diogenes
*NL*
wished
.
Add
that
a
very
cold
wind
was
blowing
,
and
't
is
not
in
the
month
*NL*
of
January
that
one
can
successfully
attempt
to
make
humanity
take
*NL*
this
new
step
.
This
garment
presented
itself
,
I
took
it
,
and
I
left
my
*NL*
ancient
black
smock
,
which
,
for
a
hermetic
like
myself
,
was
far
*NL*
from
being
hermetically
closed
.
Behold
me
then
,
in
the
garments
of
a
*NL*
stage-player
,
like
Saint
Genest
.
What
would
you
have
?
't
is
an
eclipse
.
*NL*
Apollo
himself
tended
the
flocks
of
Admetus
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
a
fine
profession
that
you
are
engaged
in
!
''
replied
the
*NL*
archdeacon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
agree
,
my
master
,
that
't
is
better
to
philosophize
and
poetize
,
to
*NL*
blow
the
flame
in
the
furnace
,
or
to
receive
it
from
carry
cats
on
a
*NL*
shield
.
So
,
when
you
addressed
me
,
I
was
as
foolish
as
an
ass
before
a
*NL*
turnspit
.
But
what
would
you
have
,
messire
?
One
must
eat
every
day
,
and
*NL*
the
finest
Alexandrine
verses
are
not
worth
a
bit
of
Brie
cheese
.
Now
,
I
*NL*
made
for
Madame
Marguerite
of
Flanders
,
that
famous
epithalamium
,
as
you
*NL*
know
,
and
the
city
will
not
pay
me
,
under
the
pretext
that
it
was
not
*NL*
excellent
;
as
though
one
could
give
a
tragedy
of
Sophocles
for
four
*NL*
crowns
!
Hence
,
I
was
on
the
point
of
dying
with
hunger
.
Happily
,
I
found
*NL*
that
I
was
rather
strong
in
the
jaw
;
so
I
said
to
this
jaw
,
--
perform
*NL*
some
feats
of
strength
and
of
equilibrium
:
nourish
thyself
.
_
Ale
te
*NL*
ipsam
_
.
A
pack
of
beggars
who
have
become
my
good
friends
,
have
taught
*NL*
me
twenty
sorts
of
herculean
feats
,
and
now
I
give
to
my
teeth
every
*NL*
evening
the
bread
which
they
have
earned
during
the
day
by
the
sweat
of
*NL*
my
brow
.
After
all
,
concede
,
I
grant
that
it
is
a
sad
employment
for
*NL*
my
intellectual
faculties
,
and
that
man
is
not
made
to
pass
his
life
in
*NL*
beating
the
tambourine
and
biting
chairs
.
But
,
reverend
master
,
it
is
*NL*
not
sufficient
to
pass
one
's
life
,
one
must
earn
the
means
for
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dom
Claude
listened
in
silence
.
All
at
once
his
deep-set
eye
assumed
so
*NL*
sagacious
and
penetrating
an
expression
,
that
Gringoire
felt
himself
,
so
*NL*
to
speak
,
searched
to
the
bottom
of
the
soul
by
that
glance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
,
Master
Pierre
;
but
how
comes
it
that
you
are
now
in
company
*NL*
with
that
gypsy
dancer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
faith
!
''
said
Gringoire
,
''
't
is
because
she
is
my
wife
and
I
am
her
*NL*
husband
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
priest
's
gloomy
eyes
flashed
into
flame
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
done
that
,
you
wretch
!
''
he
cried
,
seizing
Gringoire
's
arm
with
*NL*
fury
;
``
have
you
been
so
abandoned
by
God
as
to
raise
your
hand
against
*NL*
that
girl
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
my
chance
of
paradise
,
monseigneur
,
''
replied
Gringoire
,
trembling
*NL*
in
every
limb
,
``
I
swear
to
you
that
I
have
never
touched
her
,
if
that
is
*NL*
what
disturbs
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
do
you
talk
of
husband
and
wife
?
''
said
the
priest
.
Gringoire
*NL*
made
haste
to
relate
to
him
as
succinctly
as
possible
,
all
that
the
*NL*
reader
already
knows
,
his
adventure
in
the
Court
of
Miracles
and
the
*NL*
broken-crock
marriage
.
It
appeared
,
moreover
,
that
this
marriage
had
led
*NL*
to
no
results
whatever
,
and
that
each
evening
the
gypsy
girl
cheated
*NL*
him
of
his
nuptial
right
as
on
the
first
day
.
''
'T
is
a
mortification
,
''
*NL*
he
said
in
conclusion
,
``
but
that
is
because
I
have
had
the
misfortune
to
*NL*
wed
a
virgin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
''
demanded
the
archdeacon
,
who
had
been
gradually
*NL*
appeased
by
this
recital
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
very
difficult
to
explain
,
''
replied
the
poet
.
``
It
is
a
*NL*
superstition
.
My
wife
is
,
according
to
what
an
old
thief
,
who
is
called
*NL*
among
us
the
Duke
of
Egypt
,
has
told
me
,
a
foundling
or
a
lost
child
,
*NL*
which
is
the
same
thing
.
She
wears
on
her
neck
an
amulet
which
,
it
is
*NL*
affirmed
,
will
cause
her
to
meet
her
parents
some
day
,
but
which
will
*NL*
lose
its
virtue
if
the
young
girl
loses
hers
.
Hence
it
follows
that
both
*NL*
of
us
remain
very
virtuous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
''
resumed
Claude
,
whose
brow
cleared
more
and
more
,
``
you
believe
,
*NL*
Master
Pierre
,
that
this
creature
has
not
been
approached
by
any
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
would
you
have
a
man
do
,
Dom
Claude
,
as
against
a
superstition
?
*NL*
She
has
got
that
in
her
head
.
I
assuredly
esteem
as
a
rarity
this
*NL*
nunlike
prudery
which
is
preserved
untamed
amid
those
Bohemian
girls
*NL*
who
are
so
easily
brought
into
subjection
.
But
she
has
three
things
to
*NL*
protect
her
:
the
Duke
of
Egypt
,
who
has
taken
her
under
his
safeguard
,
*NL*
reckoning
,
perchance
,
on
selling
her
to
some
gay
abbe
;
all
his
tribe
,
*NL*
who
hold
her
in
singular
veneration
,
like
a
Notre-Dame
;
and
a
certain
*NL*
tiny
poignard
,
which
the
buxom
dame
always
wears
about
her
,
in
some
*NL*
nook
,
in
spite
of
the
ordinances
of
the
provost
,
and
which
one
causes
to
*NL*
fly
out
into
her
hands
by
squeezing
her
waist
.
'T
is
a
proud
wasp
,
I
can
*NL*
tell
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
archdeacon
pressed
Gringoire
with
questions
.
*NL*
*NL*
La
Esmeralda
,
in
the
judgment
of
Gringoire
,
was
an
inoffensive
and
*NL*
charming
creature
,
pretty
,
with
the
exception
of
a
pout
which
was
*NL*
peculiar
to
her
;
a
naive
and
passionate
damsel
,
ignorant
of
everything
*NL*
and
enthusiastic
about
everything
;
not
yet
aware
of
the
difference
*NL*
between
a
man
and
a
woman
,
even
in
her
dreams
;
made
like
that
;
wild
*NL*
especially
over
dancing
,
noise
,
the
open
air
;
a
sort
of
woman
bee
,
with
*NL*
invisible
wings
on
her
feet
,
and
living
in
a
whirlwind
.
She
owed
this
*NL*
nature
to
the
wandering
life
which
she
had
always
led
.
Gringoire
had
*NL*
succeeded
in
learning
that
,
while
a
mere
child
,
she
had
traversed
Spain
*NL*
and
Catalonia
,
even
to
Sicily
;
he
believed
that
she
had
even
been
taken
*NL*
by
the
caravan
of
Zingari
,
of
which
she
formed
a
part
,
to
the
kingdom
*NL*
of
Algiers
,
a
country
situated
in
Achaia
,
which
country
adjoins
,
on
one
*NL*
side
Albania
and
Greece
;
on
the
other
,
the
Sicilian
Sea
,
which
is
the
*NL*
road
to
Constantinople
.
The
Bohemians
,
said
Gringoire
,
were
vassals
of
*NL*
the
King
of
Algiers
,
in
his
quality
of
chief
of
the
White
Moors
.
One
*NL*
thing
is
certain
,
that
la
Esmeralda
had
come
to
France
while
still
very
*NL*
young
,
by
way
of
Hungary
.
From
all
these
countries
the
young
girl
had
*NL*
brought
back
fragments
of
queer
jargons
,
songs
,
and
strange
ideas
,
which
*NL*
made
her
language
as
motley
as
her
costume
,
half
Parisian
,
half
African
.
*NL*
However
,
the
people
of
the
quarters
which
she
frequented
loved
her
for
*NL*
her
gayety
,
her
daintiness
,
her
lively
manners
,
her
dances
,
and
her
*NL*
songs
.
She
believed
herself
to
be
hated
,
in
all
the
city
,
by
but
two
*NL*
persons
,
of
whom
she
often
spoke
in
terror
:
the
sacked
nun
of
the
*NL*
Tour-Roland
,
a
villanous
recluse
who
cherished
some
secret
grudge
*NL*
against
these
gypsies
,
and
who
cursed
the
poor
dancer
every
time
that
*NL*
the
latter
passed
before
her
window
;
and
a
priest
,
who
never
met
her
*NL*
without
casting
at
her
looks
and
words
which
frightened
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mention
of
this
last
circumstance
disturbed
the
archdeacon
greatly
,
*NL*
though
Gringoire
paid
no
attention
to
his
perturbation
;
to
such
an
*NL*
extent
had
two
months
sufficed
to
cause
the
heedless
poet
to
forget
the
*NL*
singular
details
of
the
evening
on
which
he
had
met
the
gypsy
,
and
*NL*
the
presence
of
the
archdeacon
in
it
all
.
Otherwise
,
the
little
dancer
*NL*
feared
nothing
;
she
did
not
tell
fortunes
,
which
protected
her
against
*NL*
those
trials
for
magic
which
were
so
frequently
instituted
against
gypsy
*NL*
women
.
And
then
,
Gringoire
held
the
position
of
her
brother
,
if
not
of
*NL*
her
husband
.
After
all
,
the
philosopher
endured
this
sort
of
platonic
*NL*
marriage
very
patiently
.
It
meant
a
shelter
and
bread
at
least
.
Every
*NL*
morning
,
he
set
out
from
the
lair
of
the
thieves
,
generally
with
the
*NL*
gypsy
;
he
helped
her
make
her
collections
of
targes
*
and
little
blanks
**
*NL*
in
the
squares
;
each
evening
he
returned
to
the
same
roof
with
her
,
*NL*
allowed
her
to
bolt
herself
into
her
little
chamber
,
and
slept
the
sleep
*NL*
of
the
just
.
A
very
sweet
existence
,
taking
it
all
in
all
,
he
said
,
*NL*
and
well
adapted
to
revery
.
And
then
,
on
his
soul
and
conscience
,
the
*NL*
philosopher
was
not
very
sure
that
he
was
madly
in
love
with
the
gypsy
.
*NL*
He
loved
her
goat
almost
as
dearly
.
It
was
a
charming
animal
,
gentle
,
*NL*
intelligent
,
clever
;
a
learned
goat
.
Nothing
was
more
common
in
the
*NL*
Middle
Ages
than
these
learned
animals
,
which
amazed
people
greatly
,
and
*NL*
often
led
their
instructors
to
the
stake
.
But
the
witchcraft
of
the
goat
*NL*
with
the
golden
hoofs
was
a
very
innocent
species
of
magic
.
Gringoire
*NL*
explained
them
to
the
archdeacon
,
whom
these
details
seemed
to
interest
*NL*
deeply
.
In
the
majority
of
cases
,
it
was
sufficient
to
present
the
*NL*
tambourine
to
the
goat
in
such
or
such
a
manner
,
in
order
to
obtain
from
*NL*
him
the
trick
desired
.
He
had
been
trained
to
this
by
the
gypsy
,
who
*NL*
possessed
,
in
these
delicate
arts
,
so
rare
a
talent
that
two
months
*NL*
had
sufficed
to
teach
the
goat
to
write
,
with
movable
letters
,
the
word
*NL*
``
Phoebus
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
An
ancient
Burgundian
coin
.
*NL*
*NL*
**

ancient
French
coin
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Phoebus
!
'
''
said
the
priest
;
``
why
`
Phoebus
'
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
not
,
''
replied
Gringoire
.
``
Perhaps
it
is
a
word
which
she
*NL*
believes
to
be
endowed
with
some
magic
and
secret
virtue
.
She
often
*NL*
repeats
it
in
a
low
tone
when
she
thinks
that
she
is
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
sure
,
''
persisted
Claude
,
with
his
penetrating
glance
,
``
that
it
*NL*
is
only
a
word
and
not
a
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
name
of
whom
?
''
said
the
poet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
should
I
know
?
''
said
the
priest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
what
I
imagine
,
messire
.
These
Bohemians
are
something
like
*NL*
Guebrs
,
and
adore
the
sun
.
Hence
,
Phoebus
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
does
not
seem
so
clear
to
me
as
to
you
,
Master
Pierre
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
all
,
that
does
not
concern
me
.
Let
her
mumble
her
Phoebus
at
her
*NL*
pleasure

One
thing
is
certain
,
that
Djali
loves
me
almost
as
much
as
he
*NL*
does
her
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
Djali
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
goat

*NL*
*NL*
The
archdeacon
dropped
his
chin
into
his
hand
,
and
appeared
to
reflect
*NL*
for
a
moment
.
All
at
once
he
turned
abruptly
to
Gringoire
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
swear
to
me
that
you
have
not
touched
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whom
?
''
said
Gringoire
;
``
the
goat

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

''
*NL*
*NL*
``

not

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
often
alone
with
her

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A

Porn
Claude
frowned
.

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Swear

repeated
the
archdeacon
*NL*
violently
,
``

not

that
creature
with
even
the
tip
of

``

*NL*
*NL*
The
archdeacon
's
pale
face
became
as
crimson
as
the
cheek
of
a
young
*NL*
girl
.
He
remained
for
a
moment
without
answering
;
then
,
with
visible
*NL*
embarrassment
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen

Master

Gringoire

You

so
far

take
an
interest

wish
you
well

Now
the
least

contact
with
that
Egyptian
of

make
you
the
vassal

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tried
once

said
Gringoire
,
scratching
his
ear
;
``
it
was
the
first

I
got
stung

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

audacious

clouded

over
again

On

the

with
a
smile

peeped

Gringoire
a

After
the
morning
in
the
pillory
,
the
neighbors
of
Notre-Dame
thought
*NL*
they
noticed
that
Quasimodo
's
ardor
for
ringing
had
grown
cool
.
*NL*
Formerly
,
there
had
been
peals
for
every
occasion
,
long
morning
*NL*
serenades
,
which
lasted
from
prime
to
compline
;
peals
from
the
belfry
*NL*
for
a
high
mass
,
rich
scales
drawn
over
the
smaller
bells
for
a
wedding
,
*NL*
for
a
christening
,
and
mingling
in
the
air
like
a
rich
embroidery
of
all
*NL*
sorts
of
charming
sounds
.
The
old
church
,
all
vibrating
and
sonorous
,
*NL*
was
in
a
perpetual
joy
of
bells
.
One
was
constantly
conscious
of
the
*NL*
presence
of
a
spirit
of
noise
and
caprice
,
who
sang
through
all
those
*NL*
mouths
of
brass
.
Now
that
spirit
seemed
to
have
departed
;
the
cathedral
*NL*
seemed
gloomy
,
and
gladly
remained
silent
;
festivals
and
funerals
had
*NL*
the
simple
peal
,
dry
and
bare
,
demanded
by
the
ritual
,
nothing
more
.
Of
*NL*
the
double
noise
which
constitutes
a
church
,
the
organ
within
,
the
bell
*NL*
without
,
the
organ
alone
remained
.
One
would
have
said
that
there
was
*NL*
no
longer
a
musician
in
the
belfry
.
Quasimodo
was
always
there
,
*NL*
nevertheless
;
what
,
then
,
had
happened
to
him
?
Was
it
that
the
shame
and
*NL*
despair
of
the
pillory
still
lingered
in
the
bottom
of
his
heart
,
that
*NL*
the
lashes
of
his
tormentor
's
whip
reverberated
unendingly
in
his
soul
,
*NL*
and
that
the
sadness
of
such
treatment
had
wholly
extinguished
in
him
*NL*
even
his
passion
for
the
bells
?
or
was
it
that
Marie
had
a
rival
in
the
*NL*
heart
of
the
bellringer
of
Notre-Dame
,
and
that
the
great
bell
and
her
*NL*
fourteen
sisters
were
neglected
for
something
more
amiable
and
more
*NL*
beautiful
?
*NL*
*NL*
It
chanced
that
,
in
the
year
of
grace
1482
,
Annunciation
Day
fell
on
*NL*
Tuesday
,
the
twenty-fifth
of
March
.
That
day
the
air
was
so
pure
and
*NL*
light
that
Quasimodo
felt
some
returning
affection
for
his
bells
.
He
*NL*
therefore
ascended
the
northern
tower
while
the
beadle
below
was
opening
*NL*
wide
the
doors
of
the
church
,
which
were
then
enormous
panels
of
stout
*NL*
wood
,
covered
with
leather
,
bordered
with
nails
of
gilded
iron
,
and
*NL*
framed
in
carvings
``
very
artistically
elaborated
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
arriving
in
the
lofty
bell
chamber
,
Quasimodo
gazed
for
some
time
*NL*
at
the
six
bells
and
shook
his
head
sadly
,
as
though
groaning
over
some
*NL*
foreign
element
which
had
interposed
itself
in
his
heart
between
them
*NL*
and
him
.
But
when
he
had
set
them
to
swinging
,
when
he
felt
that
cluster
*NL*
of
bells
moving
under
his
hand
,
when
he
saw
,
for
he
did
not
hear
it
,
the
*NL*
palpitating
octave
ascend
and
descend
that
sonorous
scale
,
like
a
bird
*NL*
hopping
from
branch
to
branch
;
when
the
demon
Music
,
that
demon
who
*NL*
shakes
a
sparkling
bundle
of
strette
,
trills
and
arpeggios
,
had
taken
*NL*
possession
of
the
poor
deaf
man
,
he
became
happy
once
more
,
he
forgot
*NL*
everything
,
and
his
heart
expanding
,
made
his
face
beam
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
and
came
,
he
beat
his
hands
together
,
he
ran
from
rope
to
rope
,
*NL*
he
animated
the
six
singers
with
voice
and
gesture
,
like
the
leader
of
*NL*
an
orchestra
who
is
urging
on
intelligent
musicians
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
on
,
''
said
he
,
``
go
on
,
go
on
,
Gabrielle

us
wager
that
those
who

will
understand
him
better

understand

sparrows
-RRB-

I
do
not
*NL*
see
you
making
the
least
little
shred
of
noise
.
What
is
the
meaning
of
*NL*
those
beaks
of
copper
which
seem
to
be
gaping
when
they
should
sing
?
*NL*
Come

't
is
the
Feast

the
Annunciation

The
sun
is
fine

the

must
be
fine

.
Poor
Guillaume
!
thou
art
all
out
of
breath
,
my
*NL*
big
fellow
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
wholly
absorbed
in
spurring
on
his
bells
,
all
six
of
which
vied
*NL*
with
each
other
in
leaping
and
shaking
their
shining
haunches
,
like
*NL*
a
noisy
team
of
Spanish
mules
,
pricked
on
here
and
there
by
the
*NL*
apostrophes
of
the
muleteer
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
,
on
letting
his
glance
fall
between
the
large
slate
scales
*NL*
which
cover
the
perpendicular
wall
of
the
bell
tower
at
a
certain
*NL*
height
,
he
beheld
on
the
square
a
young
girl
,
fantastically
dressed
,
*NL*
stop
,
spread
out
on
the
ground
a
carpet
,
on
which
a
small
goat
took
*NL*
up
its
post
,
and
a
group
of
spectators
collect
around
her
.
This
sight
*NL*
suddenly
changed
the
course
of
his
ideas
,
and
congealed
his
enthusiasm
*NL*
as
a
breath
of
air
congeals
melted
rosin
.
He
halted
,
turned
his
back
to
*NL*
the
bells
,
and
crouched
down
behind
the
projecting
roof
of
slate
,
fixing
*NL*
upon
the
dancer
that
dreamy
,
sweet
,
and
tender
look
which
had
already
*NL*
astonished
the
archdeacon
on
one
occasion
.
Meanwhile
,
the
forgotten
*NL*
bells
died
away
abruptly
and
all
together
,
to
the
great
disappointment
*NL*
of
the
lovers
of
bell
ringing
,
who
were
listening
in
good
faith
to
the
*NL*
peal
from
above
the
Pont
du
Change
,
and
who
went
away
dumbfounded
,
like
*NL*
a
dog
who
has
been
offered
a
bone
and
given
a
stone

CHAPTER

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
chanced
that
upon
a
fine
morning
in
this
same
month
of
March
,
I
think
*NL*
it
was
on
Saturday
the
29th
,
Saint
Eustache
's
day
,
our
young
friend
the
*NL*
student
,
Jehan
Frollo
du
Moulin
,
perceived
,
as
he
was
dressing
himself
,
*NL*
that
his
breeches
,
which
contained
his
purse
,
gave
out
no
metallic
ring
.
*NL*
``
Poor
purse
,
''
he
said
,
drawing
it
from
his
fob
,
``
what
!
not
the
smallest
*NL*
parisis
!
how
cruelly
the
dice
,
beer-pots
,
and
Venus
have
depleted
thee
!
*NL*
How
empty
,
wrinkled
,
limp
,
thou
art
!
Thou
resemblest
the
throat
of
a
*NL*
fury
!
I
ask
you
,
Messer
Cicero
,
and
Messer
Seneca
,
copies
of
whom
,
all
*NL*
dog
's
-
eared
,
I
behold
scattered
on
the
floor
,
what
profits
it
me
to
*NL*
know
,
better
than
any
governor
of
the
mint
,
or
any
Jew
on
the
Pont
aux
*NL*
Changeurs
,
that
a
golden
crown
stamped
with
a
crown
is
worth
thirty-five
*NL*
unzains
of
twenty-five
sous
,
and
eight
deniers
parisis
apiece
,
and
*NL*
that
a
crown
stamped
with
a
crescent
is
worth
thirty-six
unzains
of
*NL*
twenty-six
sous
,
six
deniers
tournois
apiece
,
if
I
have
not
a
single
*NL*
wretched
black
liard
to
risk
on
the
double-six
!
Oh
!
Consul
Cicero
!
this
*NL*
is
no
calamity
from
which
one
extricates
one
's
self
with
periphrases
,
*NL*
_
quemadmodum
_
,
and
_
verum
enim
vero
_
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
dressed
himself
sadly
.
An
idea
had
occurred
to
him
as
he
laced
his
*NL*
boots
,
but
he
rejected
it
at
first
;
nevertheless
,
it
returned
,
and
he
*NL*
put
on
his
waistcoat
wrong
side
out
,
an
evident
sign
of
violent
internal
*NL*
combat
.
At
last
he
dashed
his
cap
roughly
on
the
floor
,
and
exclaimed
:
*NL*
``
So
much
the
worse
!
Let
come
of
it
what
may
.
I
am
going
to
my
brother
!
I
*NL*
shall
catch
a
sermon
,
but
I
shall
catch
a
crown
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
hastily
donned
his
long
jacket
with
furred
half-sleeves
,
picked
*NL*
up
his
cap
,
and
went
out
like
a
man
driven
to
desperation
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
descended
the
Rue
de
la
Harpe
toward
the
City
.
As
he
passed
the
*NL*
Rue
de
la
Huchette
,
the
odor
of
those
admirable
spits
,
which
were
*NL*
incessantly
turning
,
tickled
his
olfactory
apparatus
,
and
he
bestowed
*NL*
a
loving
glance
toward
the
Cyclopean
roast
,
which
one
day
drew
from
the
*NL*
Franciscan
friar
,
Calatagirone
,
this
pathetic
exclamation
:
_
Veramente
,
*NL*
queste
rotisserie
sono
cosa
stupenda
_
!
*
But
Jehan
had
not
the
*NL*
wherewithal
to
buy
a
breakfast
,
and
he
plunged
,
with
a
profound
sigh
,
*NL*
under
the
gateway
of
the
Petit-Chatelet
,
that
enormous
double
trefoil
of
*NL*
massive
towers
which
guarded
the
entrance
to
the
City
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
Truly
,
these
roastings
are
a
stupendous
thing
!
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
even
take
the
trouble
to
cast
a
stone
in
passing
,
as
was
the
*NL*
usage
,
at
the
miserable
statue
of
that
Perinet
Leclerc
who
had
delivered
*NL*
up
the
Paris
of
Charles
VI
.
to
the
English
,
a
crime
which
his
effigy
,
*NL*
its
face
battered
with
stones
and
soiled
with
mud
,
expiated
for
three
*NL*
centuries
at
the
corner
of
the
Rue
de
la
Harpe
and
the
Rue
de
Buci
,
as
*NL*
in
an
eternal
pillory
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Petit-Pont
traversed
,
the
Rue
Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve
crossed
,
Jehan
*NL*
de
Molendino
found
himself
in
front
of
Notre-Dame
.
Then
indecision
*NL*
seized
upon
him
once
more
,
and
he
paced
for
several
minutes
round
the
*NL*
statue
of
M.
Legris
,
repeating
to
himself
with
anguish
:
``
The
sermon
is
*NL*
sure
,
the
crown
is
doubtful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stopped
a
beadle
who
emerged
from
the
cloister
,
--
``
Where
is
monsieur
*NL*
the
archdeacon
of
Josas
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
that
he
is
in
his
secret
cell
in
the
tower
,
''
said
the
beadle
;
*NL*
``
I
should
advise
you
not
to
disturb
him
there
,
unless
you
come
from
some
*NL*
one
like
the
pope
or
monsieur
the
king
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jehan
clapped
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Becliable
_
!
here
's
a
magnificent
chance
to
see
the
famous
sorcery
*NL*
cell
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
reflection
having
brought
him
to
a
decision
,
he
plunged
resolutely
*NL*
into
the
small
black
doorway
,
and
began
the
ascent
of
the
spiral
of
*NL*
Saint-Gilles
,
which
leads
to
the
upper
stories
of
the
tower
.
``
I
am
*NL*
going
to
see
,
''
he
said
to
himself
on
the
way
.
``
By
the
ravens
of
the
Holy
*NL*
Virgin
!
it
must
needs
be
a
curious
thing
,
that
cell
which
my
reverend
*NL*
brother
hides
so
secretly
!
'T
is
said
that
he
lights
up
the
kitchens
of
*NL*
hell
there
,
and
that
he
cooks
the
philosopher
's
stone
there
over
a
hot
*NL*
fire
.
_
Bedieu
_
!
I
care
no
more
for
the
philosopher
's
stone
than
for
a
*NL*
pebble
,
and
I
would
rather
find
over
his
furnace
an
omelette
of
Easter
*NL*
eggs
and
bacon
,
than
the
biggest
philosopher
's
stone
in
the
world
.
''
'
*NL*
*NL*
On
arriving
at
the
gallery
of
slender
columns
,
he
took
breath
for
a
*NL*
moment
,
and
swore
against
the
interminable
staircase
by
I
know
not
how
*NL*
many
million
cartloads
of
devils
;
then
he
resumed
his
ascent
through
*NL*
the
narrow
door
of
the
north
tower
,
now
closed
to
the
public
.
*NL*
Several
moments
after
passing
the
bell
chamber
,
he
came
upon
a
little
*NL*
landing-place
,
built
in
a
lateral
niche
,
and
under
the
vault
of
a
low
,
*NL*
pointed
door
,
whose
enormous
lock
and
strong
iron
bars
he
was
enabled
*NL*
to
see
through
a
loophole
pierced
in
the
opposite
circular
wall
of
the
*NL*
staircase
.
Persons
desirous
of
visiting
this
door
at
the
present
day
*NL*
will
recognize
it
by
this
inscription
engraved
in
white
letters
on
the
*NL*
black
wall
:
``
J'ADORE
CORALIE
,

SIGNE

''
``

stands
in
the
*NL*
text
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ugh
!
''
said
the
scholar
;
''
't
is
here
,
no
doubt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
key
was
in
the
lock
,
the
door
was
very
close
to
him
;
he
gave
it
a
*NL*
gentle
push
and
thrust
his
head
through
the
opening
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
can
not
have
failed
to
turn
over
the
admirable
works
of
*NL*
Rembrandt
,
that
Shakespeare
of
painting
.
Amid
so
many
marvellous
*NL*
engravings
,
there
is
one
etching
in
particular
,
which
is
supposed
*NL*
to
represent
Doctor
Faust
,
and
which
it
is
impossible
to
contemplate
*NL*
without
being
dazzled
.
It
represents
a
gloomy
cell
;
in
the
centre
is
a
*NL*
table
loaded
with
hideous
objects
;
skulls
,
spheres
,
alembics
,
compasses
,
*NL*
hieroglyphic
parchments
.
The
doctor
is
before
this
table
clad
in
his
*NL*
large
coat
and
covered
to
the
very
eyebrows
with
his
furred
cap
.
He
is
*NL*
visible
only
to
his
waist
.
He
has
half
risen
from
his
immense
arm-chair
,
*NL*
his
clenched
fists
rest
on
the
table
,
and
he
is
gazing
with
curiosity
*NL*
and
terror
at
a
large
luminous
circle
,
formed
of
magic
letters
,
which
*NL*
gleams
from
the
wall
beyond
,
like
the
solar
spectrum
in
a
dark
chamber
.
*NL*
This
cabalistic
sun
seems
to
tremble
before
the
eye
,
and
fills
the
wan
*NL*
cell
with
its
mysterious
radiance
.
It
is
horrible
and
it
is
beautiful
.
*NL*
*NL*
Something
very
similar
to
Faust
's
cell
presented
itself
to
Jehan
's
view
,
*NL*
when
he
ventured
his
head
through
the
half-open
door
.
It
also
was
a
*NL*
gloomy
and
sparsely
lighted
retreat
.
There
also
stood
a
large
arm-chair
*NL*
and
a
large
table
,
compasses
,
alembics
,
skeletons
of
animals
suspended
*NL*
from
the
ceiling
,
a
globe
rolling
on
the
floor
,
hippocephali
mingled
*NL*
promiscuously
with
drinking
cups
,
in
which
quivered
leaves
of
gold
,
*NL*
skulls
placed
upon
vellum
checkered
with
figures
and
characters
,
huge
*NL*
manuscripts
piled
up
wide
open
,
without
mercy
on
the
cracking
corners
of
*NL*
the
parchment
;
in
short
,
all
the
rubbish
of
science
,
and
everywhere
*NL*
on
this
confusion
dust
and
spiders
'
webs
;
but
there
was
no
circle
of
*NL*
luminous
letters
,
no
doctor
in
an
ecstasy
contemplating
the
flaming
*NL*
vision
,
as
the
eagle
gazes
upon
the
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
the
cell
was
not
deserted
.
A
man
was
seated
in
the
*NL*
arm-chair
,
and
bending
over
the
table
.
Jehan
,
to
whom
his
back
was
*NL*
turned
,
could
see
only
his
shoulders
and
the
back
of
his
skull
;
but
*NL*
he
had
no
difficulty
in
recognizing
that
bald
head
,
which
nature
had
*NL*
provided
with
an
eternal
tonsure
,
as
though
desirous
of
marking
,
by
this
*NL*
external
symbol
,
the
archdeacon
's
irresistible
clerical
vocation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jehan
accordingly
recognized
his
brother
;
but
the
door
had
been
*NL*
opened
so
softly
,
that
nothing
warned
Dom
Claude
of
his
presence
.
The
*NL*
inquisitive
scholar
took
advantage
of
this
circumstance
to
examine
the
*NL*
cell
for
a
few
moments
at
his
leisure
.
A
large
furnace
,
which
he
had
*NL*
not
at
first
observed
,
stood
to
the
left
of
the
arm-chair
,
beneath
the
*NL*
window
.
The
ray
of
light
which
penetrated
through
this
aperture
made
*NL*
its
way
through
a
spider
's
circular
web
,
which
tastefully
inscribed
its
*NL*
delicate
rose
in
the
arch
of
the
window
,
and
in
the
centre
of
which
the
*NL*
insect
architect
hung
motionless
,
like
the
hub
of
this
wheel
of
lace
.
*NL*
Upon
the
furnace
were
accumulated
in
disorder
,
all
sorts
of
vases
,
*NL*
earthenware
bottles
,
glass
retorts
,
and
mattresses
of
charcoal
.
Jehan
*NL*
observed
,
with
a
sigh
,
that
there
was
no
frying-pan
.
``
How
cold
the
*NL*
kitchen
utensils
are
!
''
he
said
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
,
there
was
no
fire
in
the
furnace
,
and
it
seemed
as
though
none
*NL*
had
been
lighted
for
a
long
time
.
A
glass
mask
,
which
Jehan
noticed
*NL*
among
the
utensils
of
alchemy
,
and
which
served
no
doubt
,
to
protect
the
*NL*
archdeacon
's
face
when
he
was
working
over
some
substance
to
be
dreaded
,
*NL*
lay
in
one
corner
covered
with
dust
and
apparently
forgotten
.
Beside
it
*NL*
lay
a
pair
of
bellows
no
less
dusty
,
the
upper
side
of
which
bore
this
*NL*
inscription
incrusted
in
copper
letters
:
SPIRA
SPERA
.
*NL*
*NL*
Other
inscriptions
were
written
,
in
accordance
with
the
fashion
of
the
*NL*
hermetics
,
in
great
numbers
on
the
walls
;
some
traced
with
ink
,
others
*NL*
engraved
with
a
metal
point
.
There
were
,
moreover
,
Gothic
letters
,
*NL*
Hebrew
letters
,
Greek
letters
,
and
Roman
letters
,
pell-mell
;
the
*NL*
inscriptions
overflowed
at
haphazard
,
on
top
of
each
other
,
the
more
*NL*
recent
effacing
the
more
ancient
,
and
all
entangled
with
each
other
,
*NL*
like
the
branches
in
a
thicket
,
like
pikes
in
an
affray
.
It
was
,
in
*NL*
fact
,
a
strangely
confused
mingling
of
all
human
philosophies
,
all
*NL*
reveries
,
all
human
wisdom
.
Here
and
there
one
shone
out
from
among
the
*NL*
rest
like
a
banner
among
lance
heads
.
Generally
,
it
was
a
brief
Greek
*NL*
or
Roman
device
,
such
as
the
Middle
Ages
knew
so
well
how
to
*NL*
formulate
.
--
_
Unde
?
Inde

--
Homo

;
*NL*
sometimes
a
word
devoid
of
all
apparent
sense
,
_
Avayxoqpayia
_
,
which
*NL*
possibly
contained
a
bitter
allusion
to
the
regime
of
the
cloister
;
*NL*
sometimes
a
simple
maxim
of
clerical
discipline
formulated
in
a
regular
*NL*
hexameter
_
Coelestem
dominum
terrestrem
dicite
dominum
_
.
There
was
*NL*
also
Hebrew
jargon
,
of
which
Jehan
,
who
as
yet
knew
but
little
Greek
,
*NL*
understood
nothing
;
and
all
were
traversed
in
every
direction
by
stars
,
*NL*
by
figures
of
men
or
animals
,
and
by
intersecting
triangles
;
and
this
*NL*
contributed
not
a
little
to
make
the
scrawled
wall
of
the
cell
resemble
*NL*
a
sheet
of
paper
over
which
a
monkey
had
drawn
back
and
forth
a
pen
*NL*
filled
with
ink
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
chamber
,
moreover
,
presented
a
general
aspect
of
abandonment
*NL*
and
dilapidation
;
and
the
bad
state
of
the
utensils
induced
the
*NL*
supposition
that
their
owner
had
long
been
distracted
from
his
labors
*NL*
by
other
preoccupations
.
Meanwhile
,
this
master
,
bent
over
a
vast
*NL*
manuscript
,
ornamented
with
fantastical
illustrations
,
appeared
to
be
*NL*
tormented
by
an
idea
which
incessantly
mingled
with
his
meditations
.
*NL*
That
at
least
was
Jehan
's
idea
,
when
he
heard
him
exclaim
,
with
the
*NL*
thoughtful
breaks
of
a
dreamer
thinking
aloud
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Manou
said
it
,
and
Zoroaster
taught
it
!
the
sun
is
born
from
fire
,
*NL*
the
moon
from
the
sun
;
fire
is
the
soul
of
the
universe
;
its
elementary
*NL*
atoms
pour
forth
and
flow
incessantly
upon
the
world
through
infinite
*NL*
channels
!
At
the
point
where
these
currents
intersect
each
other
in
the
*NL*
heavens
,
they
produce
light
;
at
their
points
of
intersection
on
earth
,
*NL*
they
produce
gold
.
Light
,
gold
;
the
same
thing
!
From
fire
to
the
*NL*
concrete
state
.
The
difference
between
the
visible
and
the
palpable
,
*NL*
between
the
fluid
and
the
solid
in
the
same
substance
,
between
water
and
*NL*
ice
,
nothing
more
.
These
are
no
dreams
;
it
is
the
general
law
of
nature
.
*NL*
But
what
is
one
to
do
in
order
to
extract
from
science
the
secret
of
*NL*
this
general
law
?
What
!
this
light
which
inundates
my
hand
is
gold
!
*NL*
These
same
atoms
dilated
in
accordance
with
a
certain
law
need
only
be
*NL*
condensed
in
accordance
with
another
law
.
How
is
it
to
be
done
?
*NL*
Some
have
fancied
by
burying
a
ray
of
sunlight
,
Averroes
,
--
yes
,
't
is
*NL*
Averroes
,
--
Averroes
buried
one
under
the
first
pillar
on
the
left
of
the
*NL*
sanctuary
of
the
Koran
,
in
the
great
Mahometan
mosque
of
Cordova
;
but
*NL*
the
vault
can
not
be
opened
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
whether
the
*NL*
operation
has
succeeded
,
until
after
the
lapse
of
eight
thousand
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
devil
!
''
said
Jehan
,
to
himself
,
''
't
is
a
long
while
to
wait
for
a
*NL*
crown
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Others
have
thought
,
''
continued
the
dreamy
archdeacon
,
``
that
it
*NL*
would
be
better
worth
while
to
operate
upon
a
ray
of
Sirius
.
But
't
is
*NL*
exceeding
hard
to
obtain
this
ray
pure
,
because
of
the
simultaneous
*NL*
presence
of
other
stars
whose
rays
mingle
with
it
.
Flamel
esteemed
*NL*
it
more
simple
to
operate
upon
terrestrial
fire
.
Flamel
!
there
's
*NL*
predestination
in
the
name
!
_
Flamma
_
!
yes
,
fire
.
All
lies
there
.
The
*NL*
diamond
is
contained
in
the
carbon
,
gold
is
in
the
fire
.
But
how
to
*NL*
extract
it
?
Magistri
affirms
that
there
are
certain
feminine
names
,
*NL*
which
possess
a
charm
so
sweet
and
mysterious
,
that
it
suffices
to
*NL*
pronounce
them
during
the
operation
.
Let
us
read
what
Manon
says
on
the
*NL*
matter
:
`
Where
women
are
honored
,
the
divinities
are
rejoiced
;
where
*NL*
they
are
despised
,
it
is
useless
to
pray
to
God
.
The
mouth
of
a
woman
*NL*
is
constantly
pure
;
it
is
a
running
water
,
it
is
a
ray
of
sunlight
.
The
*NL*
name
of
a
woman
should
be
agreeable
,
sweet
,
fanciful
;
it
should
end
in
*NL*
long
vowels
,
and
resemble
words
of
benediction
.
'
Yes
,
the
sage
is
right
;
*NL*
in
truth
,
Maria
,
Sophia
,
la
Esmeral
--
Damnation
!
always
that
thought
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
closed
the
book
violently
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
passed
his
hand
over
his
brow
,
as
though
to
brush
away
the
idea
which
*NL*
assailed
him
;
then
he
took
from
the
table
a
nail
and
a
small
hammer
,
*NL*
whose
handle
was
curiously
painted
with
cabalistic
letters
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
some
time
,
''
he
said
with
a
bitter
smile
,
``
I
have
failed
in
all
my
*NL*
experiments
!
one
fixed
idea
possesses
me
,
and
sears
my
brain
like
fire
.
*NL*
I
have
not
even
been
able
to
discover
the
secret
of
Cassiodorus
,
*NL*
whose
lamp
burned
without
wick
and
without
oil
.
A
simple
matter
,
*NL*
nevertheless
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
deuce
!
''
muttered
Jehan
in
his
beard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hence
,
''
continued
the
priest
,
``
one
wretched
thought
is
sufficient
to
*NL*
render
a
man
weak
and
beside
himself
!
Oh
!
how
Claude
Pernelle
would
*NL*
laugh
at
me
.
She
who
could
not
turn
Nicholas
Flamel
aside
,
for
one
*NL*
moment
,
from
his
pursuit
of
the
great
work
!
What
!
I
hold
in
my
hand
the
*NL*
magic
hammer
of
Zechiele
!
at
every
blow
dealt
by
the
formidable
rabbi
,
*NL*
from
the
depths
of
his
cell
,
upon
this
nail
,
that
one
of
his
enemies
*NL*
whom
he
had
condemned
,
were
he
a
thousand
leagues
away
,
was
buried
a
*NL*
cubit
deep
in
the
earth
which
swallowed
him
.
The
King
of
France
himself
,
*NL*
in
consequence
of
once
having
inconsiderately
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
*NL*
thermaturgist
,
sank
to
the
knees
through
the
pavement
of
his
own
Paris
.
*NL*
This
took
place
three
centuries
ago
.
Well
!
I
possess
the
hammer
and
the
*NL*
nail
,
and
in
my
hands
they
are
utensils
no
more
formidable
than
a
club
*NL*
in
the
hands
of
a
maker
of
edge
tools
.
And
yet
all
that
is
required
*NL*
is
to
find
the
magic
word
which
Zechiele
pronounced
when
he
struck
his
*NL*
nail
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
nonsense
!
''
thought
Jehan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
see
,
let
us
try
!
''
resumed
the
archdeacon
briskly
.
``
Were
I
to
*NL*
succeed
,
I
should
behold
the
blue
spark
flash
from
the
head
of
the
nail
.
*NL*
Emen-Hetan
!
Emen-Hetan
!
That
's
not
it

Sigeani
!
Sigeani
!
May
this
nail
*NL*
open
the
tomb
to
any
one
who
bears
the
name
of
Phoebus
!
A
curse
upon
it
!
*NL*
Always
and
eternally
the
same
idea
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
flung
away
the
hammer
in
a
rage
.
Then
he
sank
down
so
deeply
on
*NL*
the
arm-chair
and
the
table
,
that
Jehan
lost
him
from
view
behind
the
*NL*
great
pile
of
manuscripts
.
For
the
space
of
several
minutes
,
all
that
he
*NL*
saw
was
his
fist
convulsively
clenched
on
a
book
.
Suddenly
,
Dom
Claude
*NL*
sprang
up
,
seized
a
compass
and
engraved
in
silence
upon
the
wall
in
*NL*
capital
letters
,
this
Greek
word
*NL*
*NL*
_
ANArKH
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
brother
is
mad
,
''
said
Jehan
to
himself
;
``
it
would
have
been
far
more
*NL*
simple
to
write
_
Fatum
_
,
every
one
is
not
obliged
to
know
Greek
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
archdeacon
returned
and
seated
himself
in
his
armchair
,
and
placed
*NL*
his
head
on
both
his
hands
,
as
a
sick
man
does
,
whose
head
is
heavy
and
*NL*
burning
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
student
watched
his
brother
with
surprise
.
He
did
not
know
,
he
who
*NL*
wore
his
heart
on
his
sleeve
,
he
who
observed
only
the
good
old
law
*NL*
of
Nature
in
the
world
,
he
who
allowed
his
passions
to
follow
their
*NL*
inclinations
,
and
in
whom
the
lake
of
great
emotions
was
always
dry
,
so
*NL*
freely
did
he
let
it
off
each
day
by
fresh
drains
,
--
he
did
not
know
with
*NL*
what
fury
the
sea
of
human
passions
ferments
and
boils
when
all
egress
*NL*
is
denied
to
it
,
how
it
accumulates
,
how
it
swells
,
how
it
overflows
,
*NL*
how
it
hollows
out
the
heart
;
how
it
breaks
in
inward
sobs
,
and
dull
*NL*
convulsions
,
until
it
has
rent
its
dikes
and
burst
its
bed
.
The
austere
*NL*
and
glacial
envelope
of
Claude
Frollo
,
that
cold
surface
of
steep
and
*NL*
inaccessible
virtue
,
had
always
deceived
Jehan
.
The
merry
scholar
had
*NL*
never
dreamed
that
there
was
boiling
lava
,
furious
and
profound
,
beneath
*NL*
the
snowy
brow
of
AEtna
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
do
not
know
whether
he
suddenly
became
conscious
of
these
things
;
*NL*
but
,
giddy
as
he
was
,
he
understood
that
he
had
seen
what
he
ought
not
*NL*
to
have
seen
,
that
he
had
just
surprised
the
soul
of
his
elder
brother
*NL*
in
one
of
its
most
secret
altitudes
,
and
that
Claude
must
not
be
allowed
*NL*
to
know
it
.
Seeing
that
the
archdeacon
had
fallen
back
into
his
former
*NL*
immobility
,
he
withdrew
his
head
very
softly
,
and
made
some
noise
with
*NL*
his
feet
outside
the
door
,
like
a
person
who
has
just
arrived
and
is
*NL*
giving
warning
of
his
approach
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Enter
!
''
cried
the
archdeacon
,
from
the
interior
of
his
cell
;
``
I
*NL*
was
expecting
you
.
I
left
the
door
unlocked
expressly
;
enter
Master
*NL*
Jacques
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
scholar
entered
boldly
.
The
archdeacon
,
who
was
very
much
*NL*
embarrassed
by
such
a
visit
in

a

trembled
in

``
What

is
you

Jehan

*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
a

all
the

''
said
the
scholar
,
with
his
ruddy
,
merry
,
and
*NL*
audacious
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dom
Claude
's
visage
had
resumed
its
severe
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
come
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brother
,
''
replied
the
scholar
,
making
an
effort
to
assume
a
decent
,
*NL*
pitiful
,
and
modest
mien
,
and
twirling
his
cap
in
his
hands
with
an
*NL*
innocent
air
;
``
I
am
come
to
ask
of
you
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
little
lecture
on
morality
,
of
which
I
stand
greatly
in
need
,
''
Jehan
*NL*
did
not
dare
to
add
aloud
,
--
``
and
a
little
money
of
which
I
am
in
still
*NL*
greater
need
.
''
This
last
member
of
his
phrase
remained
unuttered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
''
said
the
archdeacon
,
in
a
cold
tone
,
``
I
am
greatly
*NL*
displeased
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
!
''
sighed
the
scholar
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dom
Claude
made
his
arm-chair
describe
a
quarter
circle
,
and
gazed
*NL*
intently
at
Jehan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
glad
to
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
formidable
exordium
.
Jehan
braced
himself
for
a
rough
*NL*
encounter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jehan
,
complaints
are
brought
me
about
you
every
day
.
What
affray
was
*NL*
that
in
which
you
bruised
with
a
cudgel
a
little
vicomte
,
Albert
de
*NL*
Ramonchamp
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
said
Jehan
,
``
a
vast
thing
that
!
A
malicious
page
amused
himself
by
*NL*
splashing
the
scholars
,
by
making
his
horse
gallop
through
the
mire
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
,
''
pursued
the
archdeacon
,
``
is
that
Mahiet
Fargel
,
whose
gown
you
*NL*
have
torn
?
_
Tunicam

saith
the
complaint
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
bah
!
a
wretched
cap
of
a
Montaigu
!
Is
n't
that
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
complaint
says
_
tunicam
_
and
not
_
cappettam
_
.
Do
you
know
Latin
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jehan
did
not
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
pursued
the
priest
shaking
his
head
,
``
that
is
the
state
of
*NL*
learning
and
letters
at
the
present
day
.
The
Latin
tongue
is
hardly
*NL*
understood
,
Syriac
is
unknown
,
Greek
so
odious
that
't
is
accounted
no
*NL*
ignorance
in
the
most
learned
to
skip
a
Greek
word
without
reading
it
,
*NL*
and
to
say
,
'
_
Groecum
est
non
legitur
_
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
scholar
raised
his
eyes
boldly
.
``
Monsieur
my
brother
,
doth
it
please
*NL*
you
that
I
shall
explain
in
good
French
vernacular
that
Greek
word
which
*NL*
is
written
yonder
on
the
wall
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
word
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'
_
ANArKH
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
slight
flush
spread
over
the
cheeks
of
the
priest
with
their
high
*NL*
bones
,
like
the
puff
of
smoke
which
announces
on
the
outside
the
secret
*NL*
commotions
of
a
volcano
.
The
student
hardly
noticed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Jehan
,
''
stammered
the
elder
brother
with
an
effort
,
``
What
is
the
*NL*
meaning
of
yonder
word
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
FATE
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dom
Claude
turned
pale
again
,
and
the
scholar
pursued
carelessly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
word
below
it
,
graved
by
the
same
hand
,
'
_
Ayayvela
_
,
signifies
*NL*
`
impurity
.
'
You
see
that
people
do
know
their
Greek
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
archdeacon
remained
silent
.
This
Greek
lesson
had
rendered
him
*NL*
thoughtful
.
*NL*
*NL*
Master
Jehan
,
who
possessed
all
the
artful
ways
of
a
spoiled
child
,
*NL*
judged
that
the
moment
was
a
favorable
one
in
which
to
risk
his
request
.
*NL*
Accordingly
,
he
assumed
an
extremely
soft
tone
and
began
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
good
brother
,
do
you
hate
me
to
such
a
degree
as
to
look
savagely
*NL*
upon
me
because
of
a
few
mischievous
cuffs
and
blows
distributed
in
a
*NL*
fair
war
to
a
pack
of
lads
and
brats
,
_
quibusdam
marmosetis
_
?
You
see
,
*NL*
good
Brother
Claude
,
that
people
know
their
Latin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
all
this
caressing
hypocrisy
did
not
have
its
usual
effect
on
the
*NL*
severe
elder
brother
.
Cerberus
did
not
bite
at
the
honey
cake
.
The
*NL*
archdeacon
's
brow
did
not
lose
a
single
wrinkle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
driving
at
?
''
he
said
dryly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
in
point
of
fact
,
this
!
''
replied
Jehan
bravely
,
``
I
stand
in
need
*NL*
of
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
audacious
declaration
,
the
archdeacon
's
visage
assumed
a
*NL*
thoroughly
pedagogical
and
paternal
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
,
Monsieur
Jehan
,
that
our
fief
of
Tirechappe
,
putting
the
*NL*
direct
taxes
and
the
rents
of
the
nine
and
twenty
houses
in
a
block
,
*NL*
yields
only
nine
and
thirty
livres
,
eleven
sous
,
six
deniers
,
Parisian
.
*NL*
It
is
one
half
more
than
in
the
time
of
the
brothers
Paclet
,
but
it
is
*NL*
not
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
need
money
,
''
said
Jehan
stoically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
that
the
official
has
decided
that
our
twenty-one
houses
*NL*
should
he
moved
full
into
the
fief
of
the
Bishopric
,
and
that
we
could
*NL*
redeem
this
homage
only
by
paying
the
reverend
bishop
two
marks
of
*NL*
silver
gilt
of
the
price
of
six
livres
parisis
.
Now
,
these
two
marks
I
*NL*
have
not
yet
been
able
to
get
together

You
know
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
that
I
stand
in
need
of
money

''
repeated
Jehan
for
the
third
*NL*
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
question
caused
a
flash
of
hope
to
gleam
before
Jehan
's
eyes
.
He
*NL*
resumed
his
dainty
,
caressing
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
,
dear
Brother
Claude
,
I
should
not
come
to
you
,
with
any
evil
*NL*
motive
.
There
is
no
intention
of
cutting
a
dash
in
the
taverns
with
your
*NL*
unzains
,
and
of
strutting
about
the
streets
of
Paris
in
a
caparison
of
*NL*
gold
brocade
,
with
a
lackey
,

No

*NL*
good
work

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
good
work

''
demanded
Claude
,
somewhat
surprised
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Two
of
my
friends

to
purchase
an
outfit
for
the
infant
of

Haudriette

is
a
charity
.
It
will
cost
three

I
*NL*
should
like
to
contribute
to
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
names

your
two
friends

*NL*
*NL*
``

Peter
the
Slaughterer

and
Baptist
Crack-Gosling
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``

''
said
the
archdeacon
;
``
those
are
names
as
fit
for
a
good
work
as
a
*NL*
catapult
for
the
chief
altar
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
certain
that
Jehan
had
made
a
very
bad
choice
of
names
for
his
two
*NL*
friends
.
He
realized
it
too
late
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then
,
''
pursued
the
sagacious
Claude
,
``
what
sort
of
an
infant

*NL*
outfit
is
it
that
is
to
cost
three

for
the
child
of
a
*NL*
Haudriette
?
Since
when
have
the
Haudriette
widows
taken
to
having
babes
*NL*
in
swaddling-clothes

''
*NL*
*NL*
Jehan
broke
the
ice
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
well

yes

I
need
money

*NL*
*NL*
``
Impure

exclaimed
the
priest
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Avayveia

said
Jehan
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
quotation
,
which
the
scholar
borrowed
with
malice
,
perchance
,
from
*NL*
the
wall
of
the
cell
,
produced
a
singular
effect
on
the
archdeacon
.
He
*NL*
bit
his
lips
and
his
wrath
was
drowned
in
a
crimson
flush
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Begone
,
''
he
said
to
Jehan
.
``
I
am
expecting
some
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
scholar
made
one
more
effort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

Claude

me
at

*NL*
``
How

*NL*
*NL*
``

resumed
the
archdeacon
,
``
at
the
king

last
entry

was
a
young
gentleman

named

wore
embroidered
*NL*
on
the
housings
of
his
horse
this
device
,
upon
which
I
counsel
you
to
*NL*
meditate
:
_
Qui
non
laborat

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
scholar
remained
silent
for
a
moment
,
with
his
finger
in
his
ear
,
*NL*
his
eyes
on
the
ground
,
and
a
discomfited
mien
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
he
turned
round
to
Claude
with
the
agile
quickness
of
a
*NL*
wagtail
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
my
good

*NL*
*NL*
''

*NL*
*NL*
At
this
response
of
the
inflexible
archdeacon
,
Jehan
hid
his
head
in
*NL*
his
hands
,
like
a
woman
sobbing
,
and
exclaimed
with
an
expression
of
*NL*
despair
:
''

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
meaning

demanded
Claude
,
surprised
at
this
*NL*
freak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
indeed
!
''
said
the
scholar
;
and
he
lifted
to
Claude
his
impudent
*NL*
eyes
into
which
he
had
just
thrust
his
fists
in
order
to
communicate
to
*NL*
them
the
redness
of
tears
;
''
't
is
Greek
!
't
is
an
anapaest
of

expresses
grief
perfectly

*NL*
*NL*
And
here
he
burst
into
a
laugh
so
droll
and
violent
that
it
made
the
*NL*
archdeacon
smile
.
It
was
Claude
's
fault
,
in
fact
:
why
had
he
so
spoiled
*NL*
that
child
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

resumed
Jehan
,
emboldened
by
this
smile
,
*NL*
``
look
at
my
worn
out
boots

Is
there
a

hanging
out
their
tongues

*NL*
*NL*
The
archdeacon
promptly
returned
to
his
original
severity

*NL*
``

the
suppliant
Jehan

*NL*
*NL*
Dom
Claude
shook
his
wrinkled
head
:

*NL*
*NL*
Jehan
did
not
allow
him
to
finish

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

he
exclaimed
,
``
to
the
devil

And
thereupon
,
he
hurled
his
cap
at
the
wall
,
and
snapped
his
*NL*
fingers
like
castanets
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
archdeacon
surveyed
him
with
a
gloomy
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jehan

you
have
no
soul

*NL*
*NL*
``
In

At

the
sound
of

footstep
was
heard
on
the
staircase
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Silence

the
archdeacon
,
laying
his
finger
on
his
mouth
,
``

The

concealed
himself

occurred

him

angrily

CHAPTER
V
.
THE
TWO
MEN
CLOTHED
IN
BLACK
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
personage
who
entered
wore
a
black
gown
and
a
gloomy
mien
.
The
first
*NL*
point
which
struck
the
eye
of
our
Jehan
-LRB-
who
,
as
the
reader
will
readily
*NL*
surmise
,
had
ensconced
himself
in
his
nook
in
such
a
manner
as
to
enable
*NL*
him
to
see
and
hear
everything
at
his
good
pleasure
-RRB-
was
the
perfect
*NL*
sadness
of
the
garments
and
the
visage
of
this
new-corner
.
There
was
,
*NL*
nevertheless
,
some
sweetness
diffused
over
that
face
,
but
it
was
the
*NL*
sweetness
of
a
cat
or
a
judge
,
an
affected
,
treacherous
sweetness
.
He
*NL*
was
very
gray
and
wrinkled
,
and
not
far
from
his
sixtieth
year
,
his
*NL*
eyes
blinked
,
his
eyebrows
were
white
,
his
lip
pendulous
,
and
his
hands
*NL*
large
.
When
Jehan
saw
that
it
was
only
this
,
that
is
to
say
,
no
doubt
*NL*
a
physician
or
a
magistrate
,
and
that
this
man
had
a
nose
very
far
from
*NL*
his
mouth
,
a
sign
of
stupidity
,
he
nestled
down
in
his
hole
,
in
despair
*NL*
at
being
obliged
to
pass
an
indefinite
time
in
such
an
uncomfortable
*NL*
attitude
,
and
in
such
bad
company
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
archdeacon
,
in
the
meantime
,
had
not
even
risen
to
receive
this
*NL*
personage
.
He
had
made
the
latter
a
sign
to
seat
himself
on
a
stool
near
*NL*
the
door
,
and
,
after
several
moments
of
a
silence
which
appeared
to
be
*NL*
a
continuation
of
a
preceding
meditation
,
he
said
to
him
in
a
rather
*NL*
patronizing
way
,
``
Good
day
,
Master
Jacques
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Greeting
,
master
,
''
replied
the
man
in
black
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
in
the
two
ways
in
which
``
Master
Jacques
''
was
pronounced
*NL*
on
the
one
hand
,
and
the
``
master
''
by
preeminence
on
the
other
,
the
*NL*
difference
between
monseigneur
and
monsieur
,
between
_
domine
_
and
*NL*
_
domne
_
.
It
was
evidently
the
meeting
of
a
teacher
and
a
disciple
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
resumed
the
archdeacon
,
after
a
fresh
silence
which
Master
*NL*
Jacques
took
good
care
not
to
disturb
,
``
how
are
you
succeeding
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
!
master
,
''
said
the
other
,
with
a
sad
smile
,
``
I
am
still
seeking
*NL*
the
stone
.
Plenty
of
ashes
.
But
not
a
spark
of
gold
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dom
Claude
made
a
gesture
of
impatience
.
``
I
am
not
talking
to
you
of
*NL*
that
,
Master
Jacques
Charmolue
,
but
of
the
trial
of
your
magician
.
Is
it
*NL*
not
Marc
Cenaine
that
you
call
him
?
the
butler
of
the
Court
of
Accounts
?
*NL*
Does
he
confess
his
witchcraft
?
Have
you
been
successful
with
the
*NL*
torture
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
!
no
,
''
replied
Master
Jacques
,
still
with
his
sad
smile
;
``
we
have
*NL*
not
that
consolation
.
That
man
is
a
stone
.
We
might
have
him
boiled
in
*NL*
the
Marche
aux
Pourceaux
,
before
he
would
say
anything
.
Nevertheless
,
we
*NL*
are
sparing
nothing
for
the
sake
of
getting
at
the
truth
;
he
is
already
*NL*
thoroughly
dislocated
,
we
are
applying
all
the
herbs
of
Saint
John
's
*NL*
day
;
as
saith
the
old
comedian
Plautus
,

_
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
answers
;
that
man
is
terrible
.
I
am
at
my
wit
's
end
over
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
found
nothing
new
in
his
house
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'
faith
,
yes
,
''
said
Master
Jacques
,
fumbling
in
his
pouch
;
``
this
*NL*
parchment
.
There
are
words
in
it
which
we
can
not
comprehend
.
The
*NL*
criminal
advocate
,
Monsieur
Philippe
Lheulier
,
nevertheless
,
knows
a
*NL*
little
Hebrew
,
which
he
learned
in
that
matter
of
the
Jews
of
the
Rue
*NL*
Kantersten
,
at
Brussels
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
Master
Jacques
unrolled
a
parchment
.
``
Give
it
here
,
''
said
the
*NL*
archdeacon
.
And
casting
his
eyes
upon
this
writing
:
``
Pure
magic
,
Master
*NL*
Jacques
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
''
'Em
en-Hetan
!
'
'T
is
the
cry
of
the
vampires
*NL*
when
they
arrive
at
the
witches

sabbath
.
_
Per

,
et
cum

'T
is
the
command
which
chains
the
devil
in
hell

_
Hax

pax
,
max

!
*NL*
that
refers
to
medicine
.
A
formula
against
the
bite
of
mad
dogs
.
Master
*NL*
Jacques
!
you
are
procurator
to
the
king
in
the
Ecclesiastical
Courts
:
*NL*
this
parchment
is
abominable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
will
put
the
man
to
the
torture
once
more
.
Here
again
,
''
added
Master
*NL*
Jacques
,
fumbling
afresh
in
his
pouch
,
``
is
something
that
we
have
found
*NL*
at
Marc
Cenaine
's
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
vessel
belonging
to
the
same
family
as
those
which
covered
Dom
*NL*
Claude
's
furnace
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
the
archdeacon
,
``
a
crucible
for
alchemy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
confess
to
you
,
''
continued
Master
Jacques
,
with
his
timid
*NL*
and
awkward
smile
,
``
that
I
have
tried
it
over
the
furnace
,
but
I
have
*NL*
succeeded
no
better
than
with
my
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
archdeacon
began
an
examination
of
the
vessel
.
``
What
has
he
engraved
*NL*
on
his
crucible
?
_
Och
!
och

!
the
word
which
expels
fleas

That
Marc
*NL*
Cenaine

an
ignoramus

I
verily
believe
that
you
will
never
make
gold

with
this
!
'T

good
to
set
in
your
bedroom
in
summer

that
is
all

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Since
we
are
talking
about
errors
,
''
said
the
king
's
procurator
,
``
I
*NL*
have
just
been
studying
the
figures
on
the
portal
below
before
ascending
*NL*
hither
;
is
your
reverence
quite
sure
that
the
opening
of
the
work
of
*NL*
physics
is
there
portrayed
on
the
side
towards
the
Hotel-Dieu
,
and
that
*NL*
among
the
seven
nude
figures
which
stand
at
the
feet
of
Notre-Dame

*NL*
which
has
wings

his
heels

Mercurius

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

replied
the
priest
;

't
is
Augustin
Nypho

writes
it

Italian
doctor

had
a
bearded
demon

acquainted

with
all

things

However

we
will
descend

you

*NL*
text

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks

said
Charmolue
,
bowing
to
the
earth

``
By

*NL*
was

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
sorceress

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
gypsy
girl

comes

dance

the
official

prohibition

She
hath
a
demoniac
*NL*
goat
with
horns

devil

reads

suffice

The
prosecution

all

The
archdeacon
was
excessively
pale

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
tell
you
that
hereafter

he
stammered
,
in
a
voice
that
was
*NL*
barely
articulate

then
he
resumed
with
an
effort
,
``
Busy

*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
at

said
Charmolue
with

*NL*
*NL*
Dom
Claude
seemed
absorbed
in
gloomy
abstraction

He
turned
to
*NL*
Charmolue

*NL*
``

await

''
*NL*
*NL*
Dom
Claude
,
buried
in
his
own
thoughts
,
no
longer
listened
to
him
.
*NL*
Charmolue
,
following
the
direction
of
his
glance
,
perceived
that
it
was
*NL*
fixed
mechanically
on
the
great
spider
's
web
which
draped
the
window
.
*NL*
At
that
moment
,
a
bewildered
fly
which
was
seeking
the
March
sun
,
flung
*NL*
itself
through
the
net
and
became
entangled
there
.
On
the
agitation
of
*NL*
his
web
,
the
enormous
spider
made
an
abrupt
move
from
his
central
cell
,
*NL*
then
with
one
bound
,
rushed
upon
the
fly
,
which
he
folded
together
with
*NL*
his
fore
antennae
,
while
his
hideous
proboscis
dug
into
the
victim
's
*NL*
bead
.
``
Poor
fly
!
''
said
the
king
's
procurator
in
the
ecclesiastical
*NL*
court
;
and
he
raised
his
hand
to
save
it
.
The
archdeacon
,
as
though
*NL*
roused
with
a
start
,
withheld
his
arm
with
convulsive
violence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Master
Jacques
,
''
he
cried
,
``
let
fate
take
its
course

The
procurator
*NL*
wheeled
round
in
affright
;
it
seemed
to
him
that
pincers
of
iron
had
*NL*
clutched
his
arm
.
The
priest
's
eye
was
staring
,
wild
,
flaming
,
and
*NL*
remained
riveted
on
the
horrible
little
group
of
the
spider
and
the
fly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
!
''
continued
the
priest
,
in
a
voice
which
seemed
to
proceed
from
*NL*
the
depths
of
his
being
,
``
behold
here

Charmolue

was
gazing
at

him

The

did
not

went
on

removing
his

thou
have
broken
*NL*
through
that
formidable
web
,
with
thy
gnat
's
wings
,
thou
believest
that
*NL*
thou
couldst
have
reached
the
light
?
Alas
!
that
pane
of
glass
which
is
*NL*
further
on
,
that
transparent
obstacle
,
that
wall
of
crystal
,
harder
than
*NL*
brass
,
which
separates
all
philosophies
from
the
truth
,
how
wouldst
thou
*NL*
have
overcome
it
?
Oh
,
vanity
of
science
!
how
many
wise
men
come
flying
*NL*
from
afar
,
to
dash
their
heads
against
thee
!
How
many
systems
vainly
*NL*
fling
themselves
buzzing
against
that
eternal
pane
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
became
silent
.
These
last
ideas
,
which
had
gradually
led
him
back
*NL*
from
himself
to
science
,
appeared
to
have
calmed
him
.
Jacques
Charmolue
*NL*
recalled
him
wholly
to
a
sense
of
reality
by
addressing
to
him
this
*NL*
question
:
``
Come
,
now
,
master
,
when
will
you
come
to
aid
me
in
making
*NL*
gold
?
I
am
impatient
to
succeed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
archdeacon
shook
his
head
,
with
a
bitter
smile
.
``
Master
Jacques
read
*NL*
Michel
Psellus
'
'
_
Dialogus
de
Energia
et
Operatione
Daemonum
_
.
'
What
we
*NL*
are
doing
is
not
wholly
innocent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak
lower
,
master
!
I
have
my
suspicions
of
it
,
''
said
Jacques
*NL*
Charmolue
.
``
But
one
must
practise
a
bit
of
hermetic
science
when
one
*NL*
is
only
procurator
of
the
king
in
the
ecclesiastical
court
,
at
thirty
*NL*
crowns
tournois
a
year
.
Only
speak
low
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
the
sound
of
jaws
in
the
act
of
mastication
,
which
*NL*
proceeded
from
beneath
the
furnace
,
struck
Charmolue
's
uneasy
ear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
that
?
''
he
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
scholar
,
who
,
ill
at
ease
,
and
greatly
bored
in
his
*NL*
hiding-place
,
had
succeeded
in
discovering
there
a
stale
crust
and
a
*NL*
triangle
of
mouldy
cheese
,
and
had
set
to
devouring
the
whole
without
*NL*
ceremony
,
by
way
of
consolation
and
breakfast
.
As
he
was
very
hungry
,
*NL*
he
made
a
great
deal
of
noise
,
and
he
accented
each
mouthful
strongly
,
*NL*
which
startled
and
alarmed
the
procurator
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
a
cat
of
mine
,
''
said
the
archdeacon
,
quickly
,
``
who
is
regaling
*NL*
herself
under
there
with
a
mouse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
explanation
satisfied
Charmolue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
fact
,
master
,
''
he
replied
,
with
a
respectful
smile
,
``
all
great
*NL*
philosophers
have
their
familiar
animal
.
You
know
what
Servius
saith
:

''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Dom
Claude
,
who
stood
in
terror
of
some
new
freak
on
the
part
of
*NL*
Jehan
,
reminded
his
worthy
disciple
that
they
had
some
figures
on
*NL*
the
facade
to
study
together
,
and
the
two
quitted
the
cell
,
to
the
*NL*
accompaniment
of
a
great
``
ouf
!
''
from
the
scholar
,
who
began
to
seriously
*NL*
fear
that
his
knee
would
acquire
the
imprint
of
his
chin

THE
EFFECT

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Te
Deum

''
exclaimed
Master
Jehan
,
creeping
out
from
his
*NL*
hole
,
``
the
screech-owls
have
departed
.
Och

humming

And

cheese
to

Come
on

Let
us
*NL*
descend
,
take
the
big
brother
's
purse
and
convert
all
these
coins
into
*NL*
bottles
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
cast
a
glance
of
tenderness
and
admiration
into
the
interior
of
the
*NL*
precious
pouch
,
readjusted
his
toilet
,
rubbed
up
his
boots
,
dusted
his
*NL*
poor
half
sleeves
,
all
gray
with
ashes
,
whistled
an
air
,
indulged
in
a
*NL*
sportive
pirouette
,
looked
about
to
see
whether
there
were
not
something
*NL*
more
in
the
cell
to
take
,
gathered
up
here
and
there
on
the
furnace
some
*NL*
amulet
in
glass
which
might
serve
to
bestow
,
in
the
guise
of
a
trinket
,
*NL*
on
Isabeau
la
Thierrye
,
finally
pushed
open
the
door
which
his
brother
*NL*
had
left
unfastened
,
as
a
last
indulgence
,
and
which
he
,
in
his
*NL*
turn
,
left
open
as
a
last
piece
of
malice
,
and
descended
the
circular
*NL*
staircase
,
skipping
like
a
bird
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
midst
of
the
gloom
of
the
spiral
staircase
,
he
elbowed
something
*NL*
which
drew
aside
with
a
growl
;
he
took
it
for
granted
that
it
was
*NL*
Quasimodo
,
and
it
struck
him
as
so
droll
that
he
descended
the
remainder
*NL*
of
the
staircase
holding
his
sides
with
laughter
.
On
emerging
upon
the
*NL*
Place
,
he
laughed
yet
more
heartily
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stamped
his
foot
when
he
found
himself
on
the
ground
once
again
.
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
said
he
,
``
good
and
honorable
pavement
of
Paris
,
cursed
staircase
,
*NL*
fit
to
put
the
angels
of
Jacob
's
ladder
out
of
breath
!
What
was
I
*NL*
thinking
of
to
thrust
myself
into
that
stone
gimlet
which
pierces
the
*NL*
sky
;
all
for
the
sake
of
eating
bearded
cheese
,
and
looking
at
the
*NL*
bell-towers
of
Paris
through
a
hole
in
the
wall
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
advanced
a
few
paces
,
and
caught
sight
of
the
two
screech
owls
,
*NL*
that
is
to
say
,
Dom
Claude
and
Master
Jacques
Charmolue
,
absorbed
in
*NL*
contemplation
before
a
carving
on
the
facade
.
He
approached
them
on
*NL*
tiptoe
,
and
heard
the
archdeacon
say
in
a
low
tone
to
Charmolue
:
''
'T
was
*NL*
Guillaume
de
Paris
who
caused
a
Job
to
be
carved
upon
this
stone
of
*NL*
the
hue
of
lapis-lazuli
,
gilded
on
the
edges
.
Job
represents
the
*NL*
philosopher
's
stone
,
which
must
also
be
tried
and
martyrized
in
order
*NL*
to
become
perfect
,
as
saith
Raymond
Lulle
:
_
Sub

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
makes
no
difference
to
me
,
''
said
Jehan
,
''
't
is
I
who
have
the
*NL*
purse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
he
heard
a
powerful
and
sonorous
voice
articulate
behind
*NL*
him
a
formidable
series
of
oaths
.

*NL*
``

exclaimed
Jehan
,
``
that
can
only
be
my
friend
,
Captain
*NL*
Phoebus

''
*NL*
*NL*
This
name
of
Phoebus
reached
the
ears
of
the
archdeacon
at
the
moment
*NL*
when
he
was
explaining
to
the
king
's
procurator
the
dragon
which
is
*NL*
hiding
its
tail
in
a
bath
,
from
which
issue
smoke
and
the
head
of
*NL*
a
king
.
Dom
Claude
started
,
interrupted
himself
and
,
to
the
great
*NL*
amazement
of
Charmolue
,
turned
round
and
beheld
his
brother
Jehan
*NL*
accosting
a
tall
officer
at
the
door
of
the
Gondelaurier
mansion
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
,
in
fact
,
Captain
Phoebus
de
Chateaupers
.
He
was
backed
up
*NL*
against
a
corner
of
the
house
of
his
betrothed
and
swearing
like
a
*NL*
heathen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
my
faith
!
Captain
Phoebus
,
''
said
Jehan
,
taking
him
by
the
hand
,
``
you
*NL*
are
cursing
with
admirable
vigor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Horns

!
''
replied
the
captain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Horns
and
thunder
yourself

''
replied
the
student
.
``
Come
now
,
fair
*NL*
captain

whence
comes
this
overflow
of
fine
words

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
me

comrade

exclaimed
Phoebus
,
shaking
his
hand
,
``
a

not

Now

I
was
swearing
at

gallop
.
I
have
just
been
with
those
prudes
,
and
when
I
come
forth
,
I
*NL*
always
find
my
throat
full
of
curses

I
must
spit
them
out

strangle

*NL*
*NL*
``
Will

come

asked
the
scholar
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
proposition
calmed
the
captain

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
willing

I
have
no

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Bah

*NL*
*NL*
Jehan
spread
out
the
purse
before
the
captain
's
eyes
,
with
dignity
and
*NL*
simplicity
.
Meanwhile
,
the
archdeacon
,
who
had
abandoned
the
dumbfounded
*NL*
Charmolue
where
he
stood
,
had
approached
them
and
halted
a
few
paces
*NL*
distant
,
watching
them
without
their
noticing
him
,
so
deeply
were
they
*NL*
absorbed
in
contemplation
of
the
purse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Phoebus
exclaimed
:
``
A
purse
in
your
pocket
,
Jehan
!
't
is
the
moon
in
a
*NL*
bucket
of
water

one
sees
it
there
but
't
is
not
there
.
There
is
nothing
*NL*
but
its
shadow
.
Pardieu
!
let
us
wager
that
these
are
pebbles
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jehan
replied
coldly
:
``
Here
are
the
pebbles
wherewith
I
pave
my
fob
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
without
adding
another
word
,
he
emptied
the
purse
on
a
neighboring
*NL*
post
,
with
the
air
of
a
Roman
saving
his
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

muttered
Phoebus
,
``

Jehan
remained
dignified

immovable

Several
liards
had
rolled
into
*NL*
the
mud
;
the
captain
in
his
enthusiasm
stooped
to
pick
them
up

Jehan

restrained
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

``

Jehan
flung
back

half-closing

taking

Phoebus

arm
.

The
two
friends
set
out
towards

It
is
unnecessary
*NL*
to
mention
that
they
had
first
gathered
up
the
money
,
and
that
the
*NL*
archdeacon
followed
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
archdeacon
followed
them
,
gloomy
and
haggard
.
Was
this
the
Phoebus
*NL*
whose
accursed
name
had
been
mingled
with
all
his
thoughts
ever
since
*NL*
his
interview
with
Gringoire
?
He
did
not
know
it
,
but
it
was
at
least
a
*NL*
Phoebus
,
and
that
magic
name
sufficed
to
make
the
archdeacon
follow
the
*NL*
two
heedless
comrades
with
the
stealthy
tread
of
a
wolf
,
listening
*NL*
to
their
words
and
observing
their
slightest
gestures
with
anxious
*NL*
attention
.
Moreover
,
nothing
was
easier
than
to
hear
everything
they
*NL*
said
,
as
they
talked
loudly
,
not
in
the
least
concerned
that
the
*NL*
passers-by
were
taken
into
their
confidence
.
They
talked
of
duels
,
*NL*
wenches
,
wine
pots
,
and
folly
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
turning
of
a
street
,
the
sound
of
a
tambourine
reached
them
from
*NL*
a
neighboring
square
.
Dom
Claude
heard
the
officer
say
to
the
scholar
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thunder

Let

hasten
our
steps

''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

``

the

saw

sneer

bend
down
to
Jehan

ear
,
and
say
*NL*
a
few
words
to
him
in
a
low
voice
;
then
Phoebus
burst
into
a
laugh
,
and
*NL*
shook
his
head
with
a
triumphant
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Truly
?
''
said
Jehan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
soul

said
Phoebus
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Captain
Phoebus
,
you
are
a
happy
gendarme

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
archdeacon
heard
the
whole
of
this
conversation
.
His
teeth
*NL*
chattered
;
a
visible
shiver
ran
through
his
whole
body
.
He
halted
for
a
*NL*
moment
,
leaned
against
a
post
like
a
drunken
man
,
then
followed
the
two
*NL*
merry
knaves
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
moment
when
he
overtook
them
once
more
,
they
had
changed
their
*NL*
conversation

He
heard
them
singing
at
the
top
of
their
lungs
the
*NL*
ancient
refrain

CHAPTER
VII
.
THE
MYSTERIOUS
MONK
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
illustrious
wine
shop
of
``
Eve
's
Apple
''
was
situated
in
the
*NL*
University
,
at
the
corner
of
the
Rue
de
la
Rondelle
and
the
Rue
de
la
*NL*
Batonnier
.
It
was
a
very
spacious
and
very
low
hail
on
the
ground
floor
,
*NL*
with
a
vaulted
ceiling
whose
central
spring
rested
upon
a
huge
pillar
of
*NL*
wood
painted
yellow
;
tables
everywhere
,
shining
pewter
jugs
hanging
on
*NL*
the
walls
,
always
a
large
number
of
drinkers
,
a
plenty
of
wenches
,
a
*NL*
window
on
the
street
,
a
vine
at
the
door
,
and
over
the
door
a
flaring
*NL*
piece
of
sheet-iron
,
painted
with
an
apple
and
a
woman
,
rusted
by
*NL*
the
rain
and
turning
with
the
wind
on
an
iron
pin
.
This
species
of
*NL*
weather-vane
which
looked
upon
the
pavement
was
the
signboard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Night
was
falling
;
the
square
was
dark
;
the
wine-shop
,
full
of
candles
,
*NL*
flamed
afar
like
a
forge
in
the
gloom
;
the
noise
of
glasses
and
*NL*
feasting
,
of
oaths
and
quarrels
,
which
escaped
through
the
broken
panes
,
*NL*
was
audible
.
Through
the
mist
which
the
warmth
of
the
room
spread
over
*NL*
the
window
in
front
,
a
hundred
confused
figures
could
be
seen
swarming
,
*NL*
and
from
time
to
time
a
burst
of
noisy
laughter
broke
forth
from
it
.
*NL*
The
passers-by
who
were
going
about
their
business
,
slipped
past
this
*NL*
tumultuous
window
without
glancing
at
it
.
Only
at
intervals
did
some
*NL*
little
ragged
boy
raise
himself
on
tiptoe
as
far
as
the
ledge
,
and
hurl
*NL*
into
the
drinking-shop
,
that
ancient
,
jeering
hoot
,
with
which
drunken
*NL*
men
were
then
pursued
:
``
Aux
Houls
,
saouls
,
saouls
,
saouls
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
one
man
paced
imperturbably
back
and
forth
in
front
of
the
*NL*
tavern
,
gazing
at
it
incessantly
,
and
going
no
further
from
it
than
a
*NL*
pikernan
from
his
sentry-box
.
He
was
enveloped
in
a
mantle
to
his
very
*NL*
nose
.
This
mantle
he
had
just
purchased
of
the
old-clothes
man
,
in
the
*NL*
vicinity
of
the
``
Eve
's
Apple
,
''
no
doubt
to
protect
himself
from
the
cold
*NL*
of
the
March
evening
,
possibly
also
,
to
conceal
his
costume
.
From
time
*NL*
to
time
he
paused
in
front
of
the
dim
window
with
its
leaden
lattice
,
*NL*
listened
,
looked
,
and
stamped
his
foot
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
the
door
of
the
dram-shop
opened
.
This
was
what
he
appeared
to
*NL*
be
waiting
for
.
Two
boon
companions
came
forth
.
The
ray
of
light
which
*NL*
escaped
from
the
door
crimsoned
for
a
moment
their
jovial
faces
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
in
the
mantle
went
and
stationed
himself
on
the
watch
under
a
*NL*
porch
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Corne

tonnerre

''
said
one
of
the
comrades
.
``
Seven
o'clock
is
on
*NL*
the
point
of
striking
.
'T
is
the
hour
of
my
appointed
meeting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
,
''
repeated
his
companion
,
with
a
thick
tongue
,
``

the
contrary

that

once

never
after

you

hospital

*NL*
*NL*
``
Jehan
,
my
friend

are
drunk

said
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
replied
staggering
,

pleases
you
to
say
so

*NL*
hath

proved

*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
has
,
no
doubt
,
already
recognized
our
two
brave
friends
,
the
*NL*
captain
and
the
scholar
.
It
appears
that
the
man
who
was
lying
in
*NL*
wait
for
them
had
also
recognized
them
,
for
he
slowly
followed
all
the
*NL*
zigzags
that
the
scholar
caused
the
captain
to
make
,
who
being
a
more
*NL*
hardened
drinker
had
retained
all
his
self-possession
.
By
listening
to
*NL*
them
attentively
,
the
man
in
the
mantle
could
catch
in
its
entirety
the
*NL*
following
interesting
conversation
,

exclaimed
Phoebus

and
he
gave
the
drunken
scholar
a
rough
*NL*
push
;
the
latter
slipped
against
the
wall
,
and
slid
flabbily
to
the
*NL*
pavement
of
Philip
Augustus
.
A
remnant
of
fraternal
pity
,
which
never

abandons
the
heart
of
a
drinker

prompted
Phoebus
to
roll
Jehan
with
his

foot
upon
one
of
those
pillows
of
the
poor
,
which
Providence
keeps
in

*NL*
the

The

adjusted
*NL*
Jehan
's
head
upon
an
inclined
plane
of
cabbage-stumps
,
and
on
the
very
*NL*
instant
,
the
scholar
fell
to
snoring
in
a
magnificent
bass
.
Meanwhile
,
*NL*
all
malice
was
not
extinguished
in
the
captain
's
heart
.
``
So
much
the
*NL*
worse
if
the

cart
picks
you
up

''
he
said
to
the
*NL*
poor
,
sleeping
clerk
;
and
he
strode
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
in
the
mantle
,
who
had
not
ceased
to
follow
him
,
halted
for
a
*NL*
moment
before
the
prostrate
scholar
,
as
though
agitated
by
indecision
;
*NL*
then
,
uttering
a
profound
sigh
,
he
also
strode
off
in
pursuit
of
the
*NL*
captain
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
,
like
them
,
will
leave
Jehan
to
slumber
beneath
the
open
sky
,
and
*NL*
will
follow
them
also
,
if
it
pleases
the
reader
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
emerging
into
the
Rue
Saint-Andre-des-Arcs
,
Captain
Phoebus
perceived
*NL*
that
some
one
was
following
him
.
On
glancing
sideways
by
chance
,
he
*NL*
perceived
a
sort
of
shadow
crawling
after
him
along
the
walls
.
He
*NL*
halted
,
it
halted
;
he
resumed
his
march
,
it
resumed
its
march
.
This
*NL*
disturbed
him
not
overmuch
.
``
Ah
,
bah
!
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
I
have
not
a
*NL*
sou
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
in
front
of
the
College
d'Autun
.
It
was
at
this
college
that
*NL*
he
had
sketched
out
what
he
called
his
studies
,
and
,
through
a
scholar
's
*NL*
teasing
habit
which
still
lingered
in
him
,
he
never
passed
the
facade
*NL*
without
inflicting
on
the
statue
of
Cardinal
Pierre
Bertrand
,
sculptured
*NL*
to
the
right
of
the
portal
,
the
affront
of
which
Priapus
complains
so
*NL*
bitterly
in
the
satire
of
Horace
,
_
Olim
truncus
eram
ficulnus
_
.
He
*NL*
had
done
this
with
so
much
unrelenting
animosity
that
the
inscription
,
*NL*
_
Eduensis
episcopus
_
,
had
become
almost
effaced
.
Therefore
,
he
halted
*NL*
before
the
statue
according
to
his
wont
.
The
street
was
utterly
*NL*
deserted
.
At
the
moment
when
he
was
coolly
retying
his
shoulder
knots
,
*NL*
with
his
nose
in
the
air
,
he
saw
the
shadow
approaching
him
with
slow
*NL*
steps
,
so
slow
that
he
had
ample
time
to
observe
that
this
shadow
wore
*NL*
a
cloak
and
a
hat
.
On
arriving
near
him
,
it
halted
and
remained
more
*NL*
motionless
than
the
statue
of
Cardinal
Bertrand
.
Meanwhile
,
it
riveted
*NL*
upon
Phoebus
two
intent
eyes
,
full
of
that
vague
light
which
issues
in
*NL*
the
night
time
from
the
pupils
of
a
cat
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
was
brave
,
and
would
have
cared
very
little
for
a
*NL*
highwayman
,
with
a
rapier
in
his
hand
.
But
this
walking
statue
,
this
*NL*
petrified
man
,
froze
his
blood
.
There
were
then
in
circulation
,
strange
*NL*
stories
of
a
surly
monk
,
a
nocturnal
prowler
about
the
streets
of
Paris
,
*NL*
and
they
recurred
confusedly
to
his
memory
.
He
remained
for
several
*NL*
minutes
in
stupefaction
,
and
finally
broke
the
silence
with
a
forced
*NL*
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
if
you
are
a
robber
,
as
I
hope
you
are

you
produce
upon

attacking

The
hand
of
the
shadow
emerged
from
beneath
its
mantle
and
descended
*NL*
upon
the
arm
of
Phoebus
with
the
grip
of
an
eagle
's
talon
;
at
the
same
*NL*

the
shadow
spoke

archangel

the
Pater
Noster
saith

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Impious
wretch
!
''
muttered
the
spectre
.
``
With
a
woman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*

_
Confiteor
_
,
--
I
confess

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
called
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
La
Smeralda
,
''
said
Phoebus
,
gayly
.
All
his
heedlessness
had
gradually
*NL*
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
name
,
the
shadow
's
grasp
shook
the
arm
of
Phoebus
in
a
fury
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Captain
Phoebus
de
Chateaupers
,
thou
liest
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Any
one
who
could
have
beheld
at
that
moment
the
captain
's
inflamed
*NL*
countenance
,
his
leap
backwards
,
so
violent
that
he
disengaged
himself
*NL*
from
the
grip
which
held
him
,
the
proud
air
with
which
he
clapped
his
*NL*
hand
on
his
swordhilt
,
and
,
in
the
presence
of
this
wrath
the
gloomy
*NL*
immobility
of
the
man
in
the
cloak
,
--
any
one
who
could
have
beheld
this
*NL*
would
have
been
frightened
.
There
was
in
it
a
touch
of
the
combat
of
Don
*NL*
Juan
and
the
statue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Christ
and
Satan
!
''
exclaimed
the
captain
.
``
That
is
a
word
which
rarely
*NL*
strikes
the
ear
of
a
Chateaupers
!
Thou
wilt
not
dare
repeat
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
liest
!
''
said
the
shadow
coldly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
gnashed
his
teeth
.
Surly
monk
,
phantom
,
superstitions
,
--
he
*NL*
had
forgotten
all
at
that
moment
.
He
no
longer
beheld
anything
but
a
*NL*
man
,
and
an
insult
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
this
is
well
!
''
he
stammered
,
in
a
voice
stifled
with
rage
.
He
*NL*
drew
his
sword
,
then
stammering
,
for
anger
as
well
as
fear
makes
a
*NL*
man
tremble
:
``
Here
!
On
the
spot
!
Come
on
!
Swords
!
Swords
!
Blood
on
the
*NL*
pavement
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
other
never
stirred
.
When
he
beheld
his
adversary
on
guard
and
*NL*
ready
to
parry
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Captain
Phoebus
,
''
he
said
,
and
his
tone
vibrated
with
bitterness
,
``
you
*NL*
forget
your
appointment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
rages
of
men
like
Phoebus
are
milk-soups
,
whose
ebullition
is
calmed
*NL*
by
a
drop
of
cold
water
.
This
simple
remark
caused
the
sword
which
*NL*
glittered
in
the
captain
's
hand
to
be
lowered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Captain
,
''
pursued
the
man
,
``
to-morrow
,
the
day
after
to-morrow
,
a
month
*NL*
hence
,
ten
years
hence
,
you
will
find
me
ready
to
cut
your
throat
;
but
*NL*
go
first
to
your
rendezvous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
sooth
,
''
said
Phoebus
,
as
though
seeking
to
capitulate
with
himself
,
*NL*
``
these
are
two
charming
things
to
be
encountered
in
a
rendezvous
,
--
a
*NL*
sword
and
a
wench
;
but
I
do
not
see
why
I
should
miss
the
one
for
the
*NL*
sake
of
the
other
,
when
I
can
have
both
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
replaced
his
sword
in
its
scabbard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
to
your
rendezvous
,
''
said
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
''
replied
Phoebus
with
some
embarrassment
,
``
many
thanks
for
*NL*
your
courtesy
.
In
fact
,
there
will
be
ample
time
to-morrow
for
us
to
*NL*
chop
up
father
Adam
's
doublet
into
slashes
and
buttonholes
.
I
am
obliged
*NL*
to
you
for
allowing
me
to
pass
one
more
agreeable
quarter
of
an
hour
.
*NL*
I
certainly
did
hope
to
put
you
in
the
gutter
,
and
still
arrive
in
time
*NL*
for
the
fair
one
,
especially
as
it
has
a
better
appearance
to
make
the
*NL*
women
wait
a
little
in
such
cases
.
But
you
strike
me
as
having
the
air
*NL*
of
a
gallant
man
,
and
it
is
safer
to
defer
our
affair
until
to-morrow
.
*NL*
So
I
will
betake
myself
to
my
rendezvous
;
it
is
for
seven
o'clock
,
as
*NL*
you
know
.
''
Here
Phoebus
scratched
his
ear
.
``
Ah
.
_
Corne
Dieu
_
!
I
had
*NL*
forgotten
!
I
have
n't
a
sou
to
discharge
the
price
of
the
garret
,
and
the
*NL*
old
crone
will
insist
on
being
paid
in
advance
.
She
distrusts
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
is
the
wherewithal
to
pay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Phoebus
felt
the
stranger
's
cold
hand
slip
into
his
a
large
piece
of
*NL*
money
.
He
could
not
refrain
from
taking
the
money
and
pressing
the
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Vrai
Dieu
_
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
``
you
are
a
good
fellow
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
condition
,
''
said
the
man
.
``
Prove
to
me
that
I
have
been
wrong
and
*NL*
that
you
were
speaking
the
truth
.
Hide
me
in
some
corner
whence
I
can
*NL*
see
whether
this
woman
is
really
the
one
whose
name
you
uttered
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
replied
Phoebus
,
''
't
is
all
one
to
me
.
We
will
take
,
the
*NL*
Sainte-Marthe
chamber
;
you
can
look
at
your
ease
from
the
kennel
hard
*NL*
by
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
then
,
''
said
the
shadow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
your
service
,
''
said
the
captain
,
``
I
know
not
whether
you
are
*NL*
Messer
Diavolus
in
person
;
but
let
us
be
good
friends
for
this
evening
;
*NL*
to-morrow
I
will
repay
you
all
my
debts
,
both
of
purse
and
sword
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
set
out
again
at
a
rapid
pace
.
At
the
expiration
of
a
few
minutes
,
*NL*
the
sound
of
the
river
announced
to
them
that
they
were
on
the
Pont
*NL*
Saint-Michel
,
then
loaded
with
houses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
first
show
you
the
way
,
''
said
Phoebus
to
his
companion
,
``
I
*NL*
will
then
go
in
search
of
the
fair
one
who
is
awaiting
me
near
the
*NL*
Petit-Chatelet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
companion
made
no
reply
;
he
had
not
uttered
a
word
since
they
had
*NL*
been
walking
side
by
side
.
Phoebus
halted
before
a
low
door
,
and
knocked
*NL*
roughly
;
a
light
made
its
appearance
through
the
cracks
of
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
there
?
''
cried
a
toothless
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Corps-Dieu
!
Tete-Dieu
!
Ventre-Dieu
_
!
''
replied
the
captain
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
opened
instantly
,
and
allowed
the
new-corners
to
see
an
old
*NL*
woman
and
an
old
lamp
,
both
of
which
trembled
.
The
old
woman
was
bent
*NL*
double
,
clad
in
tatters
,
with
a
shaking
head
,
pierced
with
two
small
*NL*
eyes
,
and
coiffed
with
a
dish
clout
;
wrinkled
everywhere
,
on
hands
and
*NL*
face
and
neck
;
her
lips
retreated
under
her
gums
,
and
about
her
mouth
*NL*
she
had
tufts
of
white
hairs
which
gave
her
the
whiskered
look
of
a
cat
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
interior
of
the
den
was
no
less
dilapitated
than
she
;
there
were
*NL*
chalk
walls
,
blackened
beams
in
the
ceiling
,
a
dismantled
chimney-piece
,
*NL*
spiders
'
webs
in
all
the
corners
,
in
the
middle
a
staggering
herd
of
*NL*
tables
and
lame
stools
,
a
dirty
child
among
the
ashes
,
and
at
the
back
a
*NL*
staircase
,
or
rather
,
a
wooden
ladder
,
which
ended
in
a
trap
door
in
the
*NL*
ceiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
entering
this
lair
,
Phoebus
's
mysterious
companion
raised
his
mantle
*NL*
to
his
very
eyes
.
Meanwhile
,
the
captain
,
swearing
like
a
Saracen
,
*NL*
hastened
to
``
make
the
sun
shine
in
a
crown
''
as
saith
our
admirable
*NL*
Regnier
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Sainte-Marthe
chamber
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
woman
addressed
him
as
monseigneur
,
and
shut
up
the
crown
in
a
*NL*
drawer
.
It
was
the
coin
which
the
man
in
the
black
mantle
had
given
to
*NL*
Phoebus
.
While
her
back
was
turned
,
the
bushy-headed
and
ragged
little
*NL*
boy
who
was
playing
in
the
ashes
,
adroitly
approached
the
drawer
,
*NL*
abstracted
the
crown
,
and
put
in
its
place
a
dry
leaf
which
he
had
*NL*
plucked
from
a
fagot
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
crone
made
a
sign
to
the
two
gentlemen
,
as
she
called
them
,
to
*NL*
follow
her
,
and
mounted
the
ladder
in
advance
of
them
.
On
arriving
at
*NL*
the
upper
story
,
she
set
her
lamp
on
a
coffer
,
and
,
Phoebus
,
like
a
*NL*
frequent
visitor
of
the
house
,
opened
a
door
which
opened
on
a
dark
*NL*
hole
.
``
Enter
here
,
my
dear
fellow
,
''
he
said
to
his
companion
.
The
man
in
*NL*
the
mantle
obeyed
without
a
word
in
reply
,
the
door
closed
upon
him
;
he
*NL*
heard
Phoebus
bolt
it
,
and
a
moment
later
descend
the
stairs
again
with
*NL*
the
aged
hag
.
The
light
had
disappeared
.

CHAPTER
VIII
.
THE
UTILITY
OF
WINDOWS
WHICH
OPEN
ON
THE
RIVER
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Claude
Frollo
-LRB-
for
we
presume
that
the
reader
,
more
intelligent
than
*NL*
Phoebus
,
has
seen
in
this
whole
adventure
no
other
surly
monk
than
the
*NL*
archdeacon
-RRB-
,
Claude
Frollo
groped
about
for
several
moments
in
the
dark
*NL*
lair
into
which
the
captain
had
bolted
him
.
It
was
one
of
those
nooks
*NL*
which
architects
sometimes
reserve
at
the
point
of
junction
between
*NL*
the
roof
and
the
supporting
wall
.
A
vertical
section
of
this
kennel
,
as
*NL*
Phoebus
had
so
justly
styled
it
,
would
have
made
a
triangle
.
Moreover
,
*NL*
there
was
neither
window
nor
air-hole
,
and
the
slope
of
the
roof
*NL*
prevented
one
from
standing
upright
.
Accordingly
,
Claude
crouched
down
*NL*
in
the
dust
,
and
the
plaster
which
cracked
beneath
him
;
his
head
was
on
*NL*
fire
;
rummaging
around
him
with
his
hands
,
he
found
on
the
floor
a
*NL*
bit
of
broken
glass
,
which
he
pressed
to
his
brow
,
and
whose
cool-ness
*NL*
afforded
him
some
relief
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
taking
place
at
that
moment
in
the
gloomy
soul
of
the
*NL*
archdeacon
?
God
and
himself
could
alone
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
what
order
was
he
arranging
in
his
mind
la
Esmeralda
,
Phoebus
,
*NL*
Jacques
Charmolue
,
his
young
brother
so
beloved
,
yet
abandoned
by
him
in
*NL*
the
mire
,
his
archdeacon
's
cassock
,
his
reputation
perhaps
dragged
to
la
*NL*
Falourdel
's
,
all
these
adventures
,
all
these
images
?
I
can
not
say
.
But
*NL*
it
is
certain
that
these
ideas
formed
in
his
mind
a
horrible
group
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
been
waiting
a
quarter
of
an
hour
;
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
*NL*
grown
a
century
older
.
All
at
once
he
heard
the
creaking
of
the
boards
*NL*
of
the
stairway
;
some
one
was
ascending
.
The
trapdoor
opened
once
more
;
*NL*
a
light
reappeared
.
There
was
a
tolerably
large
crack
in
the
worm-eaten
*NL*
door
of
his
den
;
he
put
his
face
to
it
.
In
this
manner
he
could
see
*NL*
all
that
went
on
in
the
adjoining
room
.
The
cat-faced
old
crone
was
the
*NL*
first
to
emerge
from
the
trap-door
,
lamp
in
hand
;
then
Phoebus
,
twirling
*NL*
his
moustache
,
then
a
third
person
,
that
beautiful
and
graceful
figure
,
*NL*
la
Esmeralda
.
The
priest
beheld
her
rise
from
below
like
a
dazzling
*NL*
apparition
.
Claude
trembled
,
a
cloud
spread
over
his
eyes
,
his
pulses
*NL*
beat
violently
,
everything
rustled
and
whirled
around
him
;
he
no
longer
*NL*
saw
nor
heard
anything
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
recovered
himself
,
Phoebus
and
Esmeralda
were
alone
seated
on
*NL*
the
wooden
coffer
beside
the
lamp
which
made
these
two
youthful
figures
*NL*
and
a
miserable
pallet
at
the
end
of
the
attic
stand
out
plainly
before
*NL*
the
archdeacon
's
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beside
the
pallet
was
a
window
,
whose
panes
broken
like
a
spider
's
web
*NL*
upon
which
rain
has
fallen
,
allowed
a
view
,
through
its
rent
meshes
,
of
*NL*
a
corner
of
the
sky
,
and
the
moon
lying
far
away
on
an
eiderdown
bed
of
*NL*
soft
clouds
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
girl
was
blushing
,
confused
,
palpitating
.
Her
long
,
drooping
*NL*
lashes
shaded
her
crimson
cheeks
.
The
officer
,
to
whom
she
dared
*NL*
not
lift
her
eyes
,
was
radiant
.
Mechanically
,
and
with
a
charmingly
*NL*
unconscious
gesture
,
she
traced
with
the
tip
of
her
finger
incoherent
*NL*
lines
on
the
bench
,
and
watched
her
finger
.
Her
foot
was
not
visible
.
*NL*
The
little
goat
was
nestling
upon
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
was
very
gallantly
clad
;
he
had
tufts
of
embroidery
at
his
*NL*
neck
and
wrists
;
a
great
elegance
at
that
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
without
difficulty
that
Dom
Claude
managed
to
hear
what
they
*NL*
were
saying
,
through
the
humming
of
the
blood
,
which
was
boiling
in
his
*NL*
temples
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
A
conversation
between
lovers
is
a
very
commonplace
affair
.
It
is
a
*NL*
perpetual
``
I
love
you
.
''
A
musical
phrase
which
is
very
insipid
and
very
*NL*
bald
for
indifferent
listeners
,
when
it
is
not
ornamented
with
some
*NL*
_
fioriture
_
;
but
Claude
was
not
an
indifferent
listener
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
said
the
young
girl
,
without
raising
her
eyes
,
``
do
not
despise
me
,
*NL*
monseigneur
Phoebus
.
I
feel
that
what
I
am
doing
is
not
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Despise
you
,
my
pretty
child
!
''
replied
the
officer
with
an
air
of
*NL*
superior
and
distinguished
gallantry
,
``
despise
you
,
_
tete-Dieu
_
!
and
*NL*
why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
having
followed
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
that
point
,
my
beauty
,
we
do
n't
agree
.
I
ought
not
to
despise
you
,
*NL*
but
to
hate
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
girl
looked
at
him
in
affright
:
``
Hate
me
!
what
have
I
done
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
having
required
so
much
urging
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
!
''
said
she
,
''
't
is
because
I
am
breaking
a
vow
.
I
shall
not
find
my
*NL*
parents
!
The
amulet
will
lose
its
virtue
.
But
what
matters
it
?
What
need
*NL*
have
I
of
father
or
mother
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
she
fixed
upon
the
captain
her
great
black
eyes
,
moist
with
*NL*
joy
and
tenderness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Devil
take
me
if
I
understand
you
!
''
exclaimed
Phoebus
.
La
Esmeralda
*NL*
remained
silent
for
a
moment
,
then
a
tear
dropped
from
her
eyes
,
a
sigh
*NL*
from
her
lips
,
and
she
said
,
--
``
Oh
!
monseigneur
,
I
love
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Such
a
perfume
of
chastity
,
such
a
charm
of
virtue
surrounded
the
young
*NL*
girl
,
that
Phoebus
did
not
feel
completely
at
his
ease
beside
her
.
But
*NL*
this
remark
emboldened
him
:
``
You
love
me
!
''
he
said
with
rapture
,
and
he
*NL*
threw
his
arm
round
the
gypsy
's
waist
.
He
had
only
been
waiting
for
this
*NL*
opportunity
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
priest
saw
it
,
and
tested
with
the
tip
of
his
finger
the
point
of
a
*NL*
poniard
which
he
wore
concealed
in
his
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Phoebus
,
''
continued
the
Bohemian
,
gently
releasing
her
waist
from
the
*NL*
captain
's
tenacious
hands
,
``
You
are
good
,
you
are
generous
,
you
are
*NL*
handsome
;
you
saved
me
,
me
who
am
only
a
poor
child
lost
in
Bohemia
.
I
*NL*
had
long
been
dreaming
of
an
officer
who
should
save
my
life
.
'T
was
of
*NL*
you
that
I
was
dreaming
,
before
I
knew
you
,
my
Phoebus
;
the
officer
of
*NL*
my
dream
had
a
beautiful
uniform
like
yours
,
a
grand
look
,
a
sword
;
your
*NL*
name
is
Phoebus
;
't
is
a
beautiful
name
.
I
love
your
name
;
I
love
your
*NL*
sword
.
Draw
your
sword
,
Phoebus
,
that
I
may
see
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Child
!
''
said
the
captain
,
and
he
unsheathed
his
sword
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gypsy
looked
at
the
hilt
,
the
blade
;
examined
the
cipher
on
the
*NL*
guard
with
adorable
curiosity
,
and
kissed
the
sword
,
saying
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
the
sword
of
a
brave
man
.
I
love
my
captain
.
''
Phoebus
again
*NL*
profited
by
the
opportunity
to
impress
upon
her
beautiful
bent
neck
a
*NL*
kiss
which
made
the
young
girl
straighten
herself
up
as
scarlet
as
a
*NL*
poppy
.
The
priest
gnashed
his
teeth
over
it
in
the
dark
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Phoebus
,
''
resumed
the
gypsy
,
``
let
me
talk
to
you
.
Pray
walk
a
little
,
*NL*
that
I
may
see
you
at
full
height
,
and
that
I
may
hear
your
spurs
*NL*
jingle
.
How
handsome
you
are
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
rose
to
please
her
,
chiding
her
with
a
smile
of
*NL*
satisfaction
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
child
you
are
!
By
the
way
,
my
charmer
,
have
you
seen
me
in
my
*NL*
archer
's
ceremonial
doublet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
!
no
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
very
handsome
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Phoebus
returned
and
seated
himself
beside
her
,
but
much
closer
than
*NL*
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
my
dear
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
gypsy
gave
him
several
little
taps
with
her
pretty
hand
on
his
*NL*
mouth
,
with
a
childish
mirth
and
grace
and
gayety
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
I
will
not
listen
to
you
.
Do
you
love
me
?
I
want
you
to
tell
me
*NL*
whether
you
love
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
I
love
thee
,
angel
of
my
life
!
''
exclaimed
the
captain
,
half
*NL*
kneeling
.
``
My
body
,
my
blood
,
my
soul
,
all
are
thine
;
all
are
for
thee
.
*NL*
I
love
thee
,
and
I
have
never
loved
any
one
but
thee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
had
repeated
this
phrase
so
many
times
,
in
many
similar
*NL*
conjunctures
,
that
he
delivered
it
all
in
one
breath
,
without
committing
*NL*
a
single
mistake
.
At
this
passionate
declaration
,
the
gypsy
raised
to
*NL*
the
dirty
ceiling
which
served
for
the
skies
a
glance
full
of
angelic
*NL*
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
she
murmured
,
``
this
is
the
moment
when
one
should
die
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Phoebus
found
``
the
moment
''
favorable
for
robbing
her
of
another
kiss
,
*NL*
which
went
to
torture
the
unhappy
archdeacon
in
his
nook
.
``
Die
!
''
*NL*
exclaimed
the
amorous
captain
,
``
What
are
you
saying
,
my
lovely
angel
?
*NL*
'T
is
a
time
for
living

*NL*
Listen
,
my
dear
Similar

Esmenarda
--
Pardon
!
you
have
so
prodigiously
*NL*
Saracen
a
name
that
I
never
can
get
it
straight

'T
is
a
thicket
which
*NL*
stops
me
short
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
heavens
!
''
said
the
poor
girl
,
``
and
I
thought
my
name
pretty
*NL*
because
of
its
singularity
!
But
since
it
displeases
you

I

that
I

were
called
Goton

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

The
jealous
girl
interrupted
him
:
``
Who
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
matters
that
to
us

said
Phoebus
;
``
do

*NL*
``
Oh

said
she
.
*NL*

For
several
moments
the
young
girl
,
absorbed
in
her
charming
thoughts
,
*NL*
was
dreaming
to
the
sound
of
his
voice
,
without
listening
to
the
sense
*NL*
of
his
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
how
happy
you
will
be
!
''
continued
the
captain
,
and
at
the
same
time
*NL*
he
gently
unbuckled
the
gypsy
's
girdle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
doing
?
''
she
said
quickly
.
This
``
act
of
violence
''
had
*NL*
roused
her
from
her
revery
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
''
replied
Phoebus
,
``
I
was
only
saying
that
you
must
abandon
all
*NL*
this
garb
of
folly

and
the
street
corner

are
with
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
am
with
you

''
said
the
young
girl
tenderly
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
became
pensive
and
silent
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
,
emboldened
by
her
gentleness
,
clasped
her
waist
without
*NL*
resistance
;
then
began
softly
to
unlace
the
poor
child
's
corsage
,
and
*NL*
disarranged
her
tucker
to
such
an
extent
that
the
panting
priest
beheld
*NL*
the
gypsy
's
beautiful
shoulder
emerge
from
the
gauze
,
as
round
and
brown
*NL*
as
the
moon
rising
through
the
mists
of
the
horizon
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
girl
allowed
Phoebus
to
have
his
way
.
She
did
not
appear
to
*NL*
perceive
it
.
The
eye
of
the
bold
captain
flashed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
she
turned
towards
him
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Phoebus
,
''
she
said
,
with
an
expression
of
infinite
love
,
``
instruct
me
*NL*
in
thy
religion

''
*NL*
*NL*
``

exclaimed
the

,
bursting
with
laughter
,
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
order
that
we
may
be
married

''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
's
face
assumed
an
expression
of
mingled
surprise
and
*NL*
disdain
,
of
carelessness
and
libertine
passion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
bah
!
''
said
he
,
``
do
people
marry

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Bohemian
turned
pale
,
and
her
head
drooped
sadly
on
her
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
beautiful
love

''
resumed
Phoebus
,
tenderly
,
``
what
nonsense
is
this

*NL*
A
great
thing
is

one
is
none
the
less
loving
for
not
*NL*
having

Latin
into

priest
's
shop

''
*NL*
*NL*
While
speaking
thus
in
his
softest
voice
,
he
approached
extremely
near
*NL*
the
gypsy
;
his
caressing
hands
resumed
their
place
around
her
supple
and
*NL*
delicate
waist
,
his
eye
flashed
more
and
more
,
and
everything
announced
*NL*
that
Monsieur
Phoebus
was
on
the
verge
of
one
of
those
moments
when
*NL*
Jupiter
himself
commits
so
many
follies
that
Homer
is
obliged
to
summon
*NL*
a
cloud
to
his
rescue
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Dom
Claude
saw
everything
.
The
door
was
made
of
thoroughly
rotten
*NL*
cask
staves
,
which
left
large
apertures
for
the
passage
of
his
hawklike
*NL*
gaze
.
This
brown-skinned
,
broad-shouldered
priest
,
hitherto
condemned
to
*NL*
the
austere
virginity
of
the
cloister
,
was
quivering
and
boiling
in
the
*NL*
presence
of
this
night
scene
of
love
and
voluptuousness
.
This
young
*NL*
and
beautiful
girl
given
over
in
disarray
to
the
ardent
young
man
,
made
*NL*
melted
lead
flow
in
his-veins
;
his
eyes
darted
with
sensual
jealousy
*NL*
beneath
all
those
loosened
pins
.
Any
one
who
could
,
at
that
moment
,
have
*NL*
seen
the
face
of
the
unhappy
man
glued
to
the
wormeaten
bars
,
would
have
*NL*
thought
that
he
beheld
the
face
of
a
tiger
glaring
from
the
depths
of
*NL*
a
cage
at
some
jackal
devouring
a
gazelle
.
His
eye
shone
like
a
candle
*NL*
through
the
cracks
of
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
,
Phoebus
,
with
a
rapid
gesture
,
removed
the
gypsy
's
*NL*
gorgerette
.
The
poor
child
,
who
had
remained
pale
and
dreamy
,
awoke
*NL*
with
a
start
;
she
recoiled
hastily
from
the
enterprising
officer
,
and
,
*NL*
casting
a
glance
at
her
bare
neck
and
shoulders
,
red
,
confused
,
mute
*NL*
with
shame
,
she
crossed
her
two
beautiful
arms
on
her
breast
to
conceal
*NL*
it
.
Had
it
not
been
for
the
flame
which
burned
in
her
cheeks
,
at
the
*NL*
sight
of
her
so
silent
and
motionless
,
one
would
have
declared
her
a
*NL*
statue
of
Modesty
.
Her
eyes
were
lowered
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
captain
's
gesture
had
revealed
the
mysterious
amulet
which
she
*NL*
wore
about
her
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
that
?
''
he
said
,
seizing
this
pretext
to
approach
once
more
the
*NL*
beautiful
creature
whom
he
had
just
alarmed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
touch
it
!
''
she
replied
,
quickly
,
''
't
is
my
guardian
.
It
will
make
*NL*
me
find
my
family
again

I
remain
worthy

do
so

Oh

Phoebus

me
back

gorgerette

*NL*
*NL*
Phoebus
retreated
amid
said
in
a
cold
tone
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
mademoiselle
!
I
see
plainly
that
you
do
not
love
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
love
him

''
exclaimed
the
unhappy
child
,
and
at
the
same
time
*NL*
she
clung
to
the
captain
,
whom
she
drew
to
a
seat
beside
her
.
``
I
do
not

thee

art

heart

Oh

take

do

you
will

am
thine

What
*NL*
matters
to
me

amulet

What
matters
to

'T

'T

Look
at
me

't
is
the
little
one
whom
thou
wilt
surely
*NL*
not
repulse
,
who
comes

who
comes
herself
to
seek
thee
.
My
soul

my
*NL*
life
,
my
body

my
person

all
is
one
thing

which
is
thine

*NL*
Well

no

We
will
not
marry

since
that
displeases
thee
;
and
then
,
what
*NL*
am
I
?
a
miserable
girl
of
the
gutters
;
whilst
thou
,
my
Phoebus
,
art
a
*NL*
gentleman
.
A
fine
thing
,
truly
!
A
dancer
wed
an
officer
!
I
was
mad
.
No
,
*NL*
Phoebus
,
no
;
I
will
be
thy
mistress
,
thy
amusement
,
thy
pleasure
,
when
*NL*
thou
wilt
;
a
girl
who
shall
belong
to
thee
.
I
was
only
made
for
that
,
*NL*
soiled
,
despised
,
dishonored
,
but
what
matters
it
?
--
beloved
.
I
shall
be
*NL*
the
proudest
and
the
most
joyous
of
women
.
And
when
I
grow
old
or
ugly
,
*NL*
Phoebus
,
when
I
am
no
longer
good
to
love
you
,
you
will
suffer
me
to
*NL*
serve
you
still
.
Others
will
embroider
scarfs
for
you
;
't
is
I
,
the
*NL*
servant
,
who
will
care
for
them
.
You
will
let
me
polish
your
spurs
,
*NL*
brush
your
doublet
,
dust
your
riding-boots
.
You
will
have
that
pity
,
*NL*
will
you
not
,
Phoebus
?
Meanwhile
,
take
me
!
here
,
Phoebus
,
all
this
*NL*
belongs
to
thee
,
only
love
me
!
We
gypsies
need
only
air
and
love
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
she
threw
her
arms
round
the
officer
's
neck
;
she
looked
up
*NL*
at
him
,
supplicatingly
,
with
a
beautiful
smile
,
and
all
in
tears
.
*NL*
Her
delicate
neck
rubbed
against
his
cloth
doublet
with
its
rough
*NL*
embroideries
.
She
writhed
on
her
knees
,
her
beautiful
body
half
naked
.
*NL*
The
intoxicated
captain
pressed
his
ardent
lips
to
those
lovely
African
*NL*
shoulders
.
The
young
girl
,
her
eyes
bent
on
the
ceiling
,
as
she
leaned
*NL*
backwards
,
quivered
,
all
palpitating
,
beneath
this
kiss
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
,
above
Phoebus
's
head
she
beheld
another
head
;
a
green
,
*NL*
livid
,
convulsed
face
,
with
the
look
of
a
lost
soul
;
near
this
face
was
*NL*
a
hand
grasping
a
poniard
.
--
It
was
the
face
and
hand
of
the
priest
;
he
*NL*
had
broken
the
door
and
he
was
there
.
Phoebus
could
not
see
him
.
The
*NL*
young
girl
remained
motionless
,
frozen
with
terror
,
dumb
,
beneath
that
*NL*
terrible
apparition
,
like
a
dove
which
should
raise
its
head
at
the
*NL*
moment
when
the
hawk
is
gazing
into
her
nest
with
its
round
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
not
even
utter
a
cry
.
She
saw
the
poniard
descend
upon
*NL*
Phoebus
,
and
rise
again
,
reeking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maledictions
!
''
said
the
captain
,
and
fell
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
fainted
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
moment
when
her
eyes
closed
,
when
all
feeling
vanished
in
her
,
*NL*
she
thought
that
she
felt
a
touch
of
fire
imprinted
upon
her
lips
,
a
*NL*
kiss
more
burning
than
the
red-hot
iron
of
the
executioner
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
recovered
her
senses
,
she
was
surrounded
by
soldiers
of
the
*NL*
watch
they
were
carrying
away
the
captain
,
bathed
in
his
blood
the
*NL*
priest
had
disappeared
;
the
window
at
the
back
of
the
room
which
opened
*NL*
on
the
river
was
wide
open
;
they
picked
up
a
cloak
which
they
supposed
*NL*
to
belong
to
the
officer
and
she
heard
them
saying
around
her
,
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
a
sorceress
who
has
stabbed
a
captain

CHAPTER
I
.
THE
CROWN
CHANGED
INTO
A
DRY
LEAF
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Gringoire
and
the
entire
Court
of
Miracles
were
suffering
mortal
*NL*
anxiety
.
For
a
whole
month
they
had
not
known
what
had
become
of
la
*NL*
Esmeralda
,
which
greatly
pained
the
Duke
of
Egypt
and
his
friends
the
*NL*
vagabonds
,
nor
what
had
become
of
the
goat
,
which
redoubled
Gringoire
's
*NL*
grief
.
One
evening
the
gypsy
had
disappeared
,
and
since
that
time
had
*NL*
given
no
signs
of
life
.
All
search
had
proved
fruitless
.
Some
tormenting
*NL*
bootblacks
had
told
Gringoire
about
meeting
her
that
same
evening
near
*NL*
the
Pont
Saint-Michel
,
going
off
with
an
officer
;
but
this
husband
,
*NL*
after
the
fashion
of
Bohemia
,
was
an
incredulous
philosopher
,
and
*NL*
besides
,
he
,
better
than
any
one
else
,
knew
to
what
a
point
his
wife
was
*NL*
virginal
.
He
had
been
able
to
form
a
judgment
as
to
the
unconquerable
*NL*
modesty
resulting
from
the
combined
virtues
of
the
amulet
and
the
gypsy
,
*NL*
and
he
had
mathematically
calculated
the
resistance
of
that
chastity
to
*NL*
the
second
power
.
Accordingly
,
he
was
at
ease
on
that
score
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
he
could
not
understand
this
disappearance
.
It
was
a
profound
*NL*
sorrow
.
He
would
have
grown
thin
over
it
,
had
that
been
possible
.
He
had
*NL*
forgotten
everything
,
even
his
literary
tastes
,
even
his
great
work
,
*NL*
_
De
figuris
regularibus
et
irregularibus
_
,
which
it
was
his
intention
*NL*
to
have
printed
with
the
first
money
which
he
should
procure
-LRB-
for
he
had
*NL*
raved
over
printing
,
ever
since
he
had
seen
the
``
Didascalon
''
of
Hugues
*NL*
de
Saint
Victor
,
printed
with
the
celebrated
characters
of
Vindelin
de
*NL*
Spire
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
as
he
was
passing
sadly
before
the
criminal
Tournelle
,
he
*NL*
perceived
a
considerable
crowd
at
one
of
the
gates
of
the
Palais
de
*NL*
Justice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
this
?
''
he
inquired
of
a
young
man
who
was
coming
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
not
,
sir
,
''
replied
the
young
man
.
''
'T
is
said
that
they
are
*NL*
trying
a
woman
who
hath
assassinated
a
gendarme
.
It
appears
that
there
*NL*
is
sorcery
at
the
bottom
of
it
,
the
archbishop
and
the
official
have
*NL*
intervened
in
the
case
,
and
my
brother
,
who
is
the
archdeacon
of
Josas
,
*NL*
can
think
of
nothing
else
.
Now
,
I
wished
to
speak
with
him
,
but
I
*NL*
have
not
been
able
to
reach
him
because
of
the
throng
,
which
vexes
me
*NL*
greatly
,
as
I
stand
in
need
of
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
!
sir
,
''
said
Gringoire
,
``
I
would
that
I
could
lend
you
some
,
but
,
*NL*
my
breeches
are
worn
to
holes
,
and
't
is
not
crowns
which
have
done
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
dared
not
tell
the
young
man
that
he
was
acquainted
with
his
brother
*NL*
the
archdeacon
,
to
whom
he
had
not
returned
after
the
scene
in
the
*NL*
church
;
a
negligence
which
embarrassed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
scholar
went
his
way
,
and
Gringoire
set
out
to
follow
the
crowd
*NL*
which
was
mounting
the
staircase
of
the
great
chamber
.
In
his
opinion
,
*NL*
there
was
nothing
like
the
spectacle
of
a
criminal
process
for
*NL*
dissipating
melancholy
,
so
exhilaratingly
stupid
are
judges
as
a
rule
.
*NL*
The
populace
which
he
had
joined
walked
and
elbowed
in
silence
.
After
*NL*
a
slow
and
tiresome
march
through
a
long
,
gloomy
corridor
,
which
*NL*
wound
through
the
court-house
like
the
intestinal
canal
of
the
ancient
*NL*
edifice
,
he
arrived
near
a
low
door
,
opening
upon
a
hall
which
his
lofty
*NL*
stature
permitted
him
to
survey
with
a
glance
over
the
waving
heads
of
*NL*
the
rabble
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hall
was
vast
and
gloomy
,
which
latter
fact
made
it
appear
still
*NL*
more
spacious
.
The
day
was
declining
;
the
long
,
pointed
windows
*NL*
permitted
only
a
pale
ray
of
light
to
enter
,
which
was
extinguished
*NL*
before
it
reached
the
vaulted
ceiling
,
an
enormous
trellis-work
of
*NL*
sculptured
beams
,
whose
thousand
figures
seemed
to
move
confusedly
in
*NL*
the
shadows
,
many
candles
were
already
lighted
here
and
there
on
tables
,
*NL*
and
beaming
on
the
heads
of
clerks
buried
in
masses
of
documents
.
The
*NL*
anterior
portion
of
the
ball
was
occupied
by
the
crowd
;
on
the
right
and
*NL*
left
were
magistrates
and
tables
;
at
the
end
,
upon
a
platform
,
a
*NL*
number
of
judges
,
whose
rear
rank
sank
into
the
shadows
,
sinister
and
*NL*
motionless
faces
.
The
walls
were
sown
with
innumerable
fleurs-de-lis
.
A
*NL*
large
figure
of
Christ
might
be
vaguely
descried
above
the
judges
,
*NL*
and
everywhere
there
were
pikes
and
halberds
,
upon
whose
points
the
*NL*
reflection
of
the
candles
placed
tips
of
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
''
Gringoire
inquired
of
one
of
his
neighbors
,
``
who
are
all
*NL*
those
persons
ranged
yonder
,
like
prelates
in
council
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
''
replied
the
neighbor
,
``
those
on
the
right
are
the
*NL*
counsellors
of
the
grand
chamber
;
those
on
the
left
,
the
councillors
of
*NL*
inquiry
;
the
masters
in
black
gowns
,
the
messires
in
red
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
that
big
red
fellow
,
yonder
above
them
,
who
is
sweating
?
''
*NL*
pursued
Gringoire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
monsieur
the
president
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
those
sheep
behind
him
?
''
continued
Gringoire
,
who
as
we
have
seen
,
*NL*
did
not
love
the
magistracy
,
which
arose
,
possibly
,
from
the
grudge
*NL*
which
he
cherished
against
the
Palais
de
Justice
since
his
dramatic
*NL*
misadventure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
messieurs
the
masters
of
requests
of
the
king
's
household
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
boar
in
front
of
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
monsieur
the
clerk
of
the
Court
of
Parliament

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
crocodile
on
the
right
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Master
Philippe
Lheulier
,
advocate
extraordinary
of
the
king
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
big
,
black
tom-cat
on
the
left
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Master
Jacques
Charmolue

procurator

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
now

said
Gringoire
,
``
pray
what
are
all
those
fine
*NL*
fellows
doing
yonder
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
They

*NL*
*NL*
``
Judging

I

not

*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
a

sir
.
You
can
not
see
her

She
has
her
back
turned
to
us
,
*NL*
and
she
is
hidden
from

by
the
crowd

Stay

yonder
she
is

where
you
*NL*
see

partisans

*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
the
woman
?
''
asked
Gringoire
.
``
Do
you
know
her
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
monsieur
,
I
have
but
just
arrived
.
I
merely
assume
that
there
is
*NL*
some
sorcery
about
it
,
since
the
official
is
present
at
the
trial
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
!
''
said
our
philosopher
,
``
we
are
going
to
see
all
these
magistrates
*NL*
devour
human
flesh
.
'T
is
as
good
a
spectacle

any
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur

''
remarked
his
neighbor
,
``
think
you
not
,
that
Master
Jacques
*NL*
Charmolue
has
a
very
sweet
air

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hum
!
''
replied
Gringoire
.
``
I
distrust
a
sweetness

pinched
*NL*
nostrils

thin
lips

''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
bystanders
imposed
silence
upon
the
two
chatterers
.
They
were
*NL*
listening
to
an
important
deposition
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Messeigneurs
,
''
said
an
old
woman
in
the
middle
of
the
hall
,
whose
form
*NL*
was
so
concealed
beneath
her
garments
that
one
would
have
pronounced
her
*NL*
a
walking
heap
of
rags
;
``
Messeigneurs
,
the
thing
is
as
true
as
that
I
*NL*
am
la
Falourdel
,
established
these
forty
years
at
the
Pont
Saint
Michel
,
*NL*
and
paying
regularly
my
rents
,
lord
's
dues
,
and
quit
rents
;
at
the
gate
*NL*
opposite
the
house
of
Tassin-Caillart
,
the
dyer
,
which
is
on
the
side
*NL*
up
the
river
--
a
poor
old
woman
now
,
but
a
pretty
maid
in
former
days
,
*NL*
my
lords
.
Some
one
said
to
me
lately
,
`
La
Falourdel
,
do
n't
use
your
*NL*
spinning-wheel
too
much
in
the
evening
;
the
devil
is
fond
of
combing
the
*NL*
distaffs
of
old
women
with
his
horns
.
'T
is
certain
that
the
surly
monk
*NL*
who
was
round
about
the
temple
last
year
,
now
prowls
in
the
City
.
Take
*NL*
care
,
La
Falourdel
,
that
he
doth
not
knock
at
your
door
.
'
One
evening
I
*NL*
was
spinning
on
my
wheel
,
there
comes
a
knock
at
my
door
;
I
ask
who
it
*NL*
is
.
They
swear
.
I
open
.
Two
men
enter
.
A
man
in
black
and
a
handsome
*NL*
officer
.
Of
the
black
man
nothing
could
be
seen
but
his
eyes
,
two
*NL*
coals
of
fire
.
All
the
rest
was
hat
and
cloak
.
They
say
to
me
,
--
`
The
*NL*
Sainte-Marthe
chamber
.
'
--
'T
is
my
upper
chamber
,
my
lords
,
my
cleanest
.
*NL*
They
give
me
a
crown
.
I
put
the
crown
in
my
drawer
,
and
I
say
:
`
This
*NL*
shall
go
to
buy
tripe
at
the
slaughter-house
of
la
Gloriette
to-morrow
.
'
*NL*
We
go
up
stairs
.
On
arriving
at
the
upper
chamber
,
and
while
my
back
is
*NL*
turned
,
the
black
man
disappears
.
That
dazed
me
a
bit
.
The
officer
,
who
*NL*
was
as
handsome
as
a
great
lord
,
goes
down
stairs
again
with
me
.
He
goes
*NL*
out
.
In
about
the
time
it
takes
to
spin
a
quarter
of
a
handful
of
flax
,
*NL*
he
returns
with
a
beautiful
young
girl
,
a
doll
who
would
have
shone
like
*NL*
the
sun
had
she
been
coiffed
.
She
had
with
her
a
goat
;
a
big
billy-goat
,
*NL*
whether
black
or
white
,
I
no
longer
remember
.
That
set
me
to
thinking
.
*NL*
The
girl
does
not
concern
me
,
but
the
goat
!
I
love
not
those
beasts
,
*NL*
they
have
a
beard
and
horns
.
They
are
so
like
a
man
.
And
then
,
they
*NL*
smack
of
the
witches
,
sabbath
.
However
,
I
say
nothing
.
I
had
the
crown
.
*NL*
That
is
right
,
is
it
not
,
Monsieur
Judge
?
I
show
the
captain
and
the
*NL*
wench
to
the
upper
chamber
,
and
I
leave
them
alone
;
that
is
to
say
,
with
*NL*
the
goat
.
I
go
down
and
set
to
spinning
again
--
I
must
inform
you
that
*NL*
my
house
has
a
ground
floor
and
story
above
.
I
know
not
why
I
fell
to
*NL*
thinking
of
the
surly
monk
whom
the
goat
had
put
into
my
head
again
,
and
*NL*
then
the
beautiful
girl
was
rather
strangely
decked
out
.
All
at
once
,
*NL*
I
hear
a
cry
upstairs
,
and
something
falls
on
the
floor
and
the
window
*NL*
opens
.
I
run
to
mine
which
is
beneath
it
,
and
I
behold
a
black
mass
pass
*NL*
before
my
eyes
and
fall
into
the
water
.
It
was
a
phantom
clad
like
*NL*
a
priest
.
It
was
a
moonlight
night
.
I
saw
him
quite
plainly
.
He
was
*NL*
swimming
in
the
direction
of
the
city
.
Then
,
all
of
a
tremble
,
I
call
*NL*
the
watch
.
The
gentlemen
of
the
police
enter
,
and
not
knowing
just
at
*NL*
the
first
moment
what
the
matter
was
,
and
being
merry
,
they
beat
me
.
I
*NL*
explain
to
them
.
We
go
up
stairs
,
and
what
do
we
find
?
my
poor
chamber
*NL*
all
blood
,
the
captain
stretched
out
at
full
length
with
a
dagger
in
*NL*
his
neck
,
the
girl
pretending
to
be
dead
,
and
the
goat
all
in
a
fright
.
*NL*
`
Pretty
work
!
'
I
say
,
'
I
shall
have
to
wash
that
floor
for
more
than
a
*NL*
fortnight
.
It
will
have
to
be
scraped
;
it
will
be
a
terrible
job
.
'
They
*NL*
carried
off
the
officer
,
poor
young
man
,
and
the
wench
with
her
bosom
*NL*
all
bare
.
But
wait
,
the
worst
is
that
on
the
next
day
,
when
I
wanted
to
*NL*
take
the
crown
to
buy
tripe
,
I
found
a
dead
leaf
in
its
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
woman
ceased
.
A
murmur
of
horror
ran
through
the
audience
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
phantom
,
that
goat
,
--
all
smacks
of
magic
,
''
said
one
of
Gringoire
's
*NL*
neighbors
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
dry
leaf
!
''
added
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
doubt
about
it

''
joined
in
a
third
,
``
she
is
a
witch

the
purpose

''
*NL*
*NL*
Gringoire
himself
was
not
disinclined
to
regard
this
as
altogether
*NL*
alarming
and
probable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Goody
Falourdel

said
the
president
majestically
,
``
have
you
nothing
*NL*
more

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

monseigneur

''
replied
the
crone
,
``
except
that
the
report
has
*NL*
described
my
house
as
a
hovel

stinking
;
which
is
an
outrageous

fashion
of
speaking

The
houses
on

bridge
are
not
imposing

there
are
such
multitudes

continue

The
magistrate
who
had
reminded
Gringoire
of
a
crocodile
rose
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Silence
!
''
said
he
.
``
I
pray
the
gentlemen
not

lose
sight

found

Goody

have
you
brought
that
leaf

the
demon
gave
you
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

monseigneur

she
replied
;
``
I

Here
it

*NL*
*NL*
A
bailiff
banded
the
dead
leaf
to
the
crocodile
,
who
made
a
doleful
*NL*
shake
of
the
head
,
and
passed
it
on
to
the
president
,
who
gave
it
to
the
*NL*
procurator
of
the
king
in
the
ecclesiastical
court
,
and
thus
it
made
the
*NL*
circuit
of
the
hail
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
birch
leaf

''
said
Master
Jacques
Charmolue
.
``
A
fresh
proof

magic

A
counsellor
took
up
the
word

*NL*
*NL*
``

two

afterwards
swimming

with

his

Which
of

two
handed
you

The
old
woman
pondered
for
a
moment
and
then
said
,
--
``
The
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
A
murmur
ran
through
the
crowd
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!

thought
Gringoire
,
``
this
makes
some
doubt
in
my
mind

*NL*
*NL*
But
Master
Philippe
Lheulier
,
advocate
extraordinary
to
the
king
,
*NL*
interposed
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
recall
to
these
gentlemen

that
in

deposition
taken
at
his

the

while
declaring
that
he
had
a
vague
*NL*
idea
when
the
black
man
accosted
him
that
the
latter
might
be
the
surly
*NL*
monk
,
added
that
the
phantom
had
pressed
him
eagerly
to
go
and
make
*NL*
acquaintance
with
the
accused
;
and
upon
his
,
the
captain

,
remarking
*NL*
that
he
had
no
money
,
he
had
given
him
the
crown
which
the
said
officer
*NL*
paid
to
la
Falourdel
.
Hence
,
that
crown
is
the
money
of
hell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
conclusive
observation
appeared
to
dissipate
all
the
doubts
of
*NL*
Gringoire
and
the
other
sceptics
in
the
audience
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
the
documents

added
the
king

advocate
,
as
*NL*
he
took
his
seat
;
``
you
can
consult
the
testimony
of
Phoebus

Chateaupers

*NL*
*NL*
At
that
name
,
the
accused
sprang
up
,
her
head
rose
above
the
throng
.
*NL*
Gringoire
with
horror
recognized
la
Esmeralda
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
pale
;
her
tresses
,
formerly
so
gracefully
braided
and
spangled
*NL*
with
sequins
,
hung
in
disorder
;
her
lips
were
blue
,
her
hollow
eyes
were
*NL*
terrible
.
Alas
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Phoebus
!
''
she
said
,
in
bewilderment
;
``
where
is
he
?
O
messeigneurs
!
*NL*
before
you
kill
me
,
tell
me
,
for

whether
he
still
lives

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold

replied
the

,
``
that

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

for

tell
me
if

she
repeated
,
clasping
*NL*
her
beautiful
emaciated
hands
;
and
the
sound
of
her
chains
in
contact
*NL*
with
her
dress
,
was
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
said
the
king
's
advocate
roughly
,
``
he
is
dying
.
Are
you
*NL*
satisfied
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
unhappy
girl
fell
back
on
her
criminal
's
seat
,
speechless
,
tearless
,
*NL*
white
as
a
wax
figure
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
president
bent
down
to
a
man
at
his
feet
,
who
wore
a
gold
cap
and
a
*NL*
black
gown
,
a
chain
on
his
neck
and
a
wand
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bailiff
,
bring
in
the
second
accused
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
eyes
turned
towards
a
small
door
,
which
opened
,
and
,
to
the
great
*NL*
agitation
of
Gringoire
,
gave
passage
to
a
pretty
goat
with
horns
and
*NL*
hoofs
of
gold
.
The
elegant
beast
halted
for
a
moment
on
the
threshold
,
*NL*
stretching
out
its
neck
as
though
,
perched
on
the
summit
of
a
rock
,
it
*NL*
had
before
its
eyes
an
immense
horizon
.
Suddenly
it
caught
sight
of
the
*NL*
gypsy
girl
,
and
leaping
over
the
table
and
the
head
of
a
clerk
,
in
two
*NL*
bounds
it
was
at
her
knees
;
then
it
rolled
gracefully
on
its
mistress
's
*NL*
feet
,
soliciting
a
word
or
a
caress
;
but
the
accused
remained
*NL*
motionless
,
and
poor
Djali
himself
obtained
not
a
glance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
why
--
't
is
my
villanous
beast
,
''
said
old
Falourdel
,
``
I
recognize
the
*NL*
two
perfectly
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jacques
Charmolue
interfered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
the
gentlemen
please
,
we
will
proceed
to
the
examination
of
the
*NL*
goat
.
''
He
was
,
in
fact
,
the
second
criminal
.
Nothing
more
simple
in
*NL*
those
days
than
a
suit
of
sorcery
instituted
against
an
animal
.
We
find
,
*NL*
among
others
in
the
accounts
of
the
provost
's
office
for
1466
,
a
curious
*NL*
detail
concerning
the
expenses
of
the
trial
of
Gillet-Soulart
and
his
*NL*
sow
,
``
executed
for
their
demerits
,
''
at
Corbeil
.
Everything
is
there
,
the
*NL*
cost
of
the
pens
in
which
to
place
the
sow
,
the
five
hundred
bundles
of
*NL*
brushwood
purchased
at
the
port
of
Morsant
,
the
three
pints
of
wine
*NL*
and
the
bread
,
the
last
repast
of
the
victim
fraternally
shared
by
the
*NL*
executioner
,
down
to
the
eleven
days
of
guard
and
food
for
the
sow
,
*NL*
at
eight
deniers
parisis
each
.
Sometimes
,
they
went
even
further
than
*NL*
animals
.
The
capitularies
of
Charlemagne
and
of
Louis
le
Debonnaire
*NL*
impose
severe
penalties
on
fiery
phantoms
which
presume
to
appear
in
the
*NL*
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
the
procurator
had
exclaimed
:
``
If
the
demon
which
possesses
*NL*
this
goat
,
and
which
has
resisted
all
exorcisms
,
persists
in
its
deeds
*NL*
of
witchcraft
,
if
it
alarms
the
court
with
them
,
we
warn
it
that
we
*NL*
shall
be
forced
to
put
in
requisition
against
it
the
gallows
or
the
*NL*
stake
.
Gringoire
broke
out
into
a
cold
perspiration
.
Charmolue
took
from
*NL*
the
table
the
gypsy
's
tambourine
,
and
presenting
it
to
the
goat
,
in
a
*NL*
certain
manner
,
asked
the
latter
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
o'clock
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
goat
looked
at
it
with
an
intelligent
eye
,
raised
its
gilded
hoof
,
*NL*
and
struck
seven
blows
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
,
in
fact
,
seven
o'clock
.
A
movement
of
terror
ran
through
the
*NL*
crowd
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gringoire
could
not
endure
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
destroying
himself
!
''
he
cried
aloud
;
``
You
see
well
that
he
does
*NL*
not
know
what
he
is
doing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Silence
among
the
louts
at
the
end
of
the
hail
!
''
said
the
bailiff
*NL*
sharply
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jacques
Charmolue
,
by
the
aid
of
the
same
manoeuvres
of
the
tambourine
,
*NL*
made
the
goat
perform
many
other
tricks
connected
with
the
date
of
*NL*
the
day
,
the
month
of
the
year
,
etc.
,
which
the
reader
has
already
*NL*
witnessed
.
And
,
by
virtue
of
an
optical
illusion
peculiar
to
judicial
*NL*
proceedings
,
these
same
spectators
who
had
,
probably
,
more
than
once
*NL*
applauded
in
the
public
square
Djali
's
innocent
magic
were
terrified
by
*NL*
it
beneath
the
roof
of
the
Palais
de
Justice
.
The
goat
was
undoubtedly
*NL*
the
devil
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
far
worse
when
the
procurator
of
the
king
,
having
emptied
upon
a
*NL*
floor
a
certain
bag
filled
with
movable
letters
,
which
Djali
wore
round
*NL*
his
neck
,
they
beheld
the
goat
extract
with
his
hoof
from
the
scattered
*NL*
alphabet
the
fatal
name
of
Phoebus
.
The
witchcraft
of
which
the
captain
*NL*
had
been
the
victim
appeared
irresistibly
demonstrated
,
and
in
the
eyes
*NL*
of
all
,
the
gypsy
,
that
ravishing
dancer
,
who
had
so
often
dazzled
*NL*
the
passers-by
with
her
grace
,
was
no
longer
anything
but
a
frightful
*NL*
vampire
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
she
betrayed
no
sign
of
life
;
neither
Djali
's
graceful
*NL*
evolutions
,
nor
the
menaces
of
the
court
,
nor
the
suppressed
*NL*
imprecations
of
the
spectators
any
longer
reached
her
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
order
to
arouse
her
,
a
police
officer
was
obliged
to
shake
her
*NL*
unmercifully
,
and
the
president
had
to
raise
his
voice
,
--
``
Girl

the
night

twenty-ninth
of

last

murdered

stabbed

in

concert
with
the
powers
of
darkness

by
the
aid

*NL*
*NL*
``
Horror

exclaimed
the
young

,
hiding
her
face
in
her
hands

``

said
with
terrible
accents

she
rose
with

flashing
eyes

The
president
continued
squarely
,

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
how
do
you
explain
the
facts
laid
to

replied
in
a
broken
voice

*NL*
``
That

the

the

Master
Jacques

interposed
sweetly
,
--

*NL*
``
In

*NL*
The
unhappy
girl
quivered
in
every
limb
.
But
she
rose
at
the
command
of
*NL*
the
men
with
partisans
,
and
walked
with
a
tolerably
firm
step
,
preceded
*NL*
by
Charmolue
and
the
priests
of
the
officiality
,
between
two
rows
of
*NL*
halberds
,
towards
a
medium-sized
door
which
suddenly
opened
and
closed
*NL*
again
behind
her
,
and
which
produced
upon
the
grief-stricken
Gringoire
*NL*
the
effect
of
a
horrible
mouth
which
had
just
devoured
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
disappeared
,
they
heard
a
plaintive
bleating
;
it
was
the
little
*NL*
goat
mourning
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sitting
of
the
court
was
suspended

A
counsellor
having
remarked

that

were
fatigued

that

be

replied

CHAPTER
II
.
CONTINUATION
OF
THE
CROWN
WHICH
WAS
CHANGED
INTO
A
DRY
LEAF
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
After
ascending
and
descending
several
steps
in
the
corridors
,
which
*NL*
were
so
dark
that
they
were
lighted
by
lamps
at
mid-day
,
La
Esmeralda
,
*NL*
still
surrounded
by
her
lugubrious
escort
,
was
thrust
by
the
police
into
*NL*
a
gloomy
chamber
.
This
chamber
,
circular
in
form
,
occupied
the
ground
*NL*
floor
of
one
of
those
great
towers
,
which
,
even
in
our
own
century
,
*NL*
still
pierce
through
the
layer
of
modern
edifices
with
which
modern
*NL*
Paris
has
covered
ancient
Paris
.
There
were
no
windows
to
this
cellar
;
*NL*
no
other
opening
than
the
entrance
,
which
was
low
,
and
closed
by
an
*NL*
enormous
iron
door
.
Nevertheless
,
light
was
not
lacking
;
a
furnace
had
*NL*
been
constructed
in
the
thickness
of
the
wall
;
a
large
fire
was
lighted
*NL*
there
,
which
filled
the
vault
with
its
crimson
reflections
and
deprived
*NL*
a
miserable
candle
,
which
stood
in
one
corner
,
of
all
radiance
.
The
iron
*NL*
grating
which
served
to
close
the
oven
,
being
raised
at
that
moment
,
*NL*
allowed
only
a
view
at
the
mouth
of
the
flaming
vent-hole
in
the
dark
*NL*
wall
,
the
lower
extremity
of
its
bars
,
like
a
row
of
black
and
pointed
*NL*
teeth
,
set
flat
apart
;
which
made
the
furnace
resemble
one
of
those
*NL*
mouths
of
dragons
which
spout
forth
flames
in
ancient
legends
.
By
the
*NL*
light
which
escaped
from
it
,
the
prisoner
beheld
,
all
about
the
room
,
*NL*
frightful
instruments
whose
use
she
did
not
understand
.
In
the
centre
*NL*
lay
a
leather
mattress
,
placed
almost
flat
upon
the
ground
,
over
which
*NL*
hung
a
strap
provided
with
a
buckle
,
attached
to
a
brass
ring
in
the
*NL*
mouth
of
a
flat-nosed
monster
carved
in
the
keystone
of
the
vault
.
*NL*
Tongs
,
pincers
,
large
ploughshares
,
filled
the
interior
of
the
furnace
,
*NL*
and
glowed
in
a
confused
heap
on
the
coals
.
The
sanguine
light
of
the
*NL*
furnace
illuminated
in
the
chamber
only
a
confused
mass
of
horrible
*NL*
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
Tartarus
was
called
simply
,
The
Question
Chamber
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
bed
,
in
a
negligent
attitude
,
sat
Pierrat
Torterue
,
the
official
*NL*
torturer
.
His
underlings
,
two
gnomes
with
square
faces
,
leather
aprons
,
*NL*
and
linen
breeches
,
were
moving
the
iron
instruments
on
the
coals
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
vain
did
the
poor
girl
summon
up
her
courage
;
on
entering
this
*NL*
chamber
she
was
stricken
with
horror
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sergeants
of
the
bailiff
of
the
courts
drew
up
in
line
on
one
side
,
*NL*
the
priests
of
the
officiality
on
the
other
.
A
clerk
,
inkhorn
,
and
a
*NL*
table
were
in
one
corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Master
Jacques
Charmolue
approached
the
gypsy
with
a
very
sweet
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
child
,
''
said
he
,
``
do
you
still
persist
in
your
denial
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
replied
,
in
a
dying
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
that
case
,
''
replied
Charmolue
,
``
it
will
be
very
painful
for
us
to
*NL*
have
to
question
you
more
urgently
than
we
should
like
.
Pray
take
the
*NL*
trouble
to
seat
yourself
on
this
bed
.
Master
Pierrat
,
make
room
for
*NL*
mademoiselle
,
and
close
the
door
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierrat
rose
with
a
growl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
shut
the
door
,
''
he
muttered
,
``
my
fire
will
go
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
dear
fellow
,
''
replied
Charmolue
,
``
leave
it
open
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
la
Esmeralda
had
remained
standing
.
That
leather
bed
on
which
*NL*
so
many
unhappy
wretches
had
writhed
,
frightened
her
.
Terror
chilled
the
*NL*
very
marrow
of
her
bones
;
she
stood
there
bewildered
and
stupefied
.
At
*NL*
a
sign
from
Charmolue
,
the
two
assistants
took
her
and
placed
her
in
*NL*
a
sitting
posture
on
the
bed
.
They
did
her
no
harm
;
but
when
these
*NL*
men
touched
her
,
when
that
leather
touched
her
,
she
felt
all
her
blood
*NL*
retreat
to
her
heart
.
She
cast
a
frightened
look
around
the
chamber
.
It
*NL*
seemed
to
her
as
though
she
beheld
advancing
from
all
quarters
towards
*NL*
her
,
with
the
intention
of
crawling
up
her
body
and
biting
and
pinching
*NL*
her
,
all
those
hideous
implements
of
torture
,
which
as
compared
to
the
*NL*
instruments
of
all
sorts
she
had
hitherto
seen
,
were
like
what
bats
,
*NL*
centipedes
,
and
spiders
are
among
insects
and
birds
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
the
physician
?
''
asked
Charmolue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
''
replied
a
black
gown
whom
she
had
not
before
noticed
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
shuddered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mademoiselle
,
''
resumed
the
caressing
voice
of
the
procucrator
of
the
*NL*
Ecclesiastical
court
,
``
for
the
third
time
,
do
you
persist
in
denying
the
*NL*
deeds
of
which
you
are
accused
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
time
she
could
only
make
a
sign
with
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
persist
?
''
said
Jacques
Charmolue
.
``
Then
it
grieves
me
deeply
,
but
I
*NL*
must
fulfil
my
office
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
le
Procureur
du
Roi
,
''
said
Pierrat
abruptly
,
``
How
shall
we
*NL*
begin
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Charmolue
hesitated
for
a
moment
with
the
ambiguous
grimace
of
a
poet
in
*NL*
search
of
a
rhyme
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
the
boot
,
''
he
said
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
unfortunate
girl
felt
herself
so
utterly
abandoned
by
God
and
men
,
*NL*
that
her
head
fell
upon
her
breast
like
an
inert
thing
which
has
no
*NL*
power
in
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tormentor
and
the
physician
approached
her
simultaneously
.
At
*NL*
the
same
time
,
the
two
assistants
began
to
fumble
among
their
hideous
*NL*
arsenal
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
clanking
of
their
frightful
irons
,
the
unhappy
child
quivered
*NL*
like
a
dead
frog
which
is
being
galvanized
.
``
Oh
!
''
she
murmured
,
so
low
*NL*
that
no
one
heard
her
;
``
Oh
,
my
Phoebus
!
''
Then
she
fell
back
once
more
*NL*
into
her
immobility
and
her
marble
silence
.
This
spectacle
would
have
*NL*
rent
any
other
heart
than
those
of
her
judges
.
One
would
have
pronounced
*NL*
her
a
poor
sinful
soul
,
being
tortured
by
Satan
beneath
the
scarlet
*NL*
wicket
of
hell
.
The
miserable
body
which
that
frightful
swarm
of
saws
,
*NL*
wheels
,
and
racks
were
about
to
clasp
in
their
clutches
,
the
being
*NL*
who
was
about
to
be
manipulated
by
the
harsh
hands
of
executioners
*NL*
and
pincers
,
was
that
gentle
,
white
,
fragile
creature
,
a
poor
grain
of
*NL*
millet
which
human
justice
was
handing
over
to
the
terrible
mills
of
*NL*
torture
to
grind
.
Meanwhile
,
the
callous
hands
of
Pierrat
Torterue
's
*NL*
assistants
had
bared
that
charming
leg
,
that
tiny
foot
,
which
had
so
*NL*
often
amazed
the
passers-by
with
their
delicacy
and
beauty
,
in
the
*NL*
squares
of
Paris
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
a
shame
!
''
muttered
the
tormentor
,
glancing
at
these
graceful
and
*NL*
delicate
forms
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
the
archdeacon
been
present
,
he
certainly
would
have
recalled
at
*NL*
that
moment
his
symbol
of
the
spider
and
the
fly
.
Soon
the
unfortunate
*NL*
girl
,
through
a
mist
which
spread
before
her
eyes
,
beheld
the
boot
*NL*
approach
;
she
soon
beheld
her
foot
encased
between
iron
plates
disappear
*NL*
in
the
frightful
apparatus
.
Then
terror
restored
her
strength
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
that
off
!
''
she
cried
angrily
;
and
drawing
herself
up
,
with
her
*NL*
hair
all
dishevelled
:
``
Mercy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
darted
from
the
bed
to
fling
herself
at
the
feet
of
the
king
's
*NL*
procurator
,
but
her
leg
was
fast
in
the
heavy
block
of
oak
and
iron
,
and
*NL*
she
sank
down
upon
the
boot
,
more
crushed
than
a
bee
with
a
lump
of
lead
*NL*
on
its
wing
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
a
sign
from
Charmolue
,
she
was
replaced
on
the
bed
,
and
two
coarse
*NL*
hands
adjusted
to
her
delicate
waist
the
strap
which
hung
from
the
*NL*
ceiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
the
last
time
,
do
you
confess
the
facts
in
the
case
?
''
demanded
*NL*
Charmolue
,
with
his
imperturbable
benignity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
innocent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
mademoiselle
,
how
do
you
explain
the
circumstance
laid
to
your
*NL*
charge
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
,
monseigneur
,
I
do
not
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
deny
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Proceed
,
''
said
Charmolue
to
Pierrat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierrat
turned
the
handle
of
the
screw-jack
,
the
boot
was
contracted
,
*NL*
and
the
unhappy
girl
uttered
one
of
those
horrible
cries
which
have
no
*NL*
orthography
in
any
human
language
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
!
''
said
Charmolue
to
Pierrat
.
``
Do
you
confess
?
''
he
said
to
the
*NL*
gypsy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
!
''
cried
the
wretched
girl
.
``
I
confess
!
I
confess
!
Mercy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
not
calculated
her
strength
when
she
faced
the
torture
.
Poor
*NL*
child
,
whose
life
up
to
that
time
had
been
so
joyous
,
so
pleasant
,
so
*NL*
sweet
,
the
first
pain
had
conquered
her
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Humanity
forces
me
to
tell
you
,
''
remarked
the
king
's
procurator
,
``
that
*NL*
in
confessing
,
it
is
death
that
you
must
expect
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
certainly
hope
so
!
''
said
she
.
And
she
fell
back
upon
the
leather
bed
,
*NL*
dying
,
doubled
up
,
allowing
herself
to
hang
suspended
from
the
strap
*NL*
buckled
round
her
waist
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
fair
one

hold
up

little

said
Master
Pierrat
,
raising
her
.
*NL*
``

Fleece

*NL*

breathing

*NL*
*NL*
She
raised
her
large
,
staring
eyes
to
the
magistrate
,
and
replied
,
as

though
mechanically
,
without
convulsion

agitation

*NL*
``

It

When

the

examined

CHAPTER
III

END
OF
THE
CROWN
WHICH
WAS
TURNED
INTO
A
DRY
LEAF
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
re-entered
the
audience
hall
,
pale
and
limping
,
she
was
*NL*
received
with
a
general
murmur
of
pleasure
.
On
the
part
of
the
audience
*NL*
there
was
the
feeling
of
impatience
gratified
which
one
experiences
at
*NL*
the
theatre
at
the
end
of
the
last
entr
`
acte
of
the
comedy
,
when
the
*NL*
curtain
rises
and
the
conclusion
is
about
to
begin
.
On
the
part
of
the
*NL*
judges
,
it
was
the
hope
of
getting
their
suppers
sooner
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
goat
also
bleated
with
joy
.
He
tried
to
run
towards
his
*NL*
mistress
,
but
they
had
tied
him
to
the
bench
.
*NL*
*NL*
Night
was
fully
set
in
.
The
candles
,
whose
number
had
not
been
*NL*
increased
,
cast
so
little
light
,
that
the
walls
of
the
hall
could
not
be
*NL*
seen
.
The
shadows
there
enveloped
all
objects
in
a
sort
of
mist
.
A
few
*NL*
apathetic
faces
of
judges
alone
could
be
dimly
discerned
.
Opposite
them
,
*NL*
at
the
extremity
of
the
long
hail
,
they
could
see
a
vaguely
white
point
*NL*
standing
out
against
the
sombre
background
.
This
was
the
accused
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
dragged
herself
to
her
place
.
When
Charmolue
had
installed
*NL*
himself
in
a
magisterial
manner
in
his
own
,
he
seated
himself
,
then
*NL*
rose
and
said
,
without
exhibiting
too
much
self-complacency
at
his
*NL*
success
,
--
``
The
accused
has
confessed
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bohemian
girl
,
''
the
president
continued
,
``
have
you
avowed
all
*NL*
your
deeds
of
magic
,
prostitution
,
and
assassination
on
Phoebus
de
*NL*
Chateaupers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
heart
contracted
.
She
was
heard
to
sob
amid
the
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anything
you
like
,
''
she
replied
feebly
,
``
but
kill
me
quickly
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
procurator
of
the
king
in
the
ecclesiastical
courts
,
''
said
*NL*
the
president
,
``
the
chamber
is
ready
to
hear
you
in
your
charge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Master
Charmolue
exhibited
an
alarming
note
book
,
and
began
to
read
,
*NL*
with
many
gestures
and
the
exaggerated
accentuation
of
the
pleader
,
an
*NL*
oration
in
Latin
,
wherein
all
the
proofs
of
the
suit
were
piled
up
*NL*
in
Ciceronian
periphrases
,
flanked
with
quotations
from
Plautus
,
his
*NL*
favorite
comic
author
.
We
regret
that
we
are
not
able
to
offer
to
our
*NL*
readers
this
remarkable
piece
.
The
orator
pronounced
it
with
marvellous
*NL*
action
.
Before
he
had
finished
the
exordium
,
the
perspiration
was
*NL*
starting
from
his
brow
,
and
his
eyes
from
his
bead
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
,
in
the
middle
of
a
fine
period
,
he
interrupted
himself
,
and
*NL*
his
glance
,
ordinarily
so
gentle
and
even
stupid
,
became
menacing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
''
he
exclaimed
-LRB-
this
time
in
French
,
for
it
was
not
in
*NL*
his
copy
book
-RRB-
,
``
Satan
is
so
mixed
up
in
this
affair
,
that
here
he
is
*NL*
present
at
our
debates
,
and
making
sport
of
their
majesty
.
Behold
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
he
pointed
to
the
little
goat
,
who
,
on
seeing
Charmolue
*NL*
gesticulating
,
had
,
in
point
of
fact
,
thought
it
appropriate
to
do
the
*NL*
same
,
and
had
seated
himself
on
his
haunches
,
reproducing
to
the
best
*NL*
of
his
ability
,
with
his
forepaws
and
his
bearded
head
the
pathetic
*NL*
pantomine
of
the
king
's
procurator
in
the
ecclesiastical
court
.
This
*NL*
was
,
if
the
reader
remembers
,
one
of
his
prettiest
accomplishments
.
This
*NL*
incident
,
this
last
proof
,
produced
a
great
effect
.
The
goat
's
*NL*
hoofs
were
tied
,
and
the
king
's
procurator
resumed
the
thread
of
his
*NL*
eloquence
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
very
long
,
but
the
peroration
was
admirable
.
Here
is
the
*NL*
concluding
phrase
;
let
the
reader
add
the
hoarse
voice
and
the
*NL*
breathless
gestures
of
Master
Charmolue

Another

The

*NL*
``

said
the

extraordinary
of

*NL*
*NL*
``

the

*NL*
``

one
of

``

*NL*
*NL*
They
proceeded
to
take
a
vote
without
leaving
the
room
.
The
judges
*NL*
signified
their
assent
without
giving
their
reasons
,
they
were
in
a
*NL*
hurry
.
Their
capped
heads
were
seen
uncovering
one
after

,
in
*NL*
the
gloom
,
at
the
lugubrious
question
addressed
to
them
by

The

had
the
appearance

looking

her
troubled

no

Then
the

Then
the

heard

moving

CHAPTER
IV
.
_
LASCIATE
OGNI
SPERANZA
_
--
LEAVE
ALL
HOPE
BEHIND
,
YE
WHO
*NL*
ENTER
HERE
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
Middle
Ages
,
when
an
edifice
was
complete
,
there
was
almost
*NL*
as
much
of
it
in
the
earth
as
above
it
.
Unless
built
upon
piles
,
like
*NL*
Notre-Dame
,
a
palace
,
a
fortress
,
a
church
,
had
always
a
double
bottom
.
*NL*
In
cathedrals
,
it
was
,
in
some
sort
,
another
subterranean
cathedral
,
*NL*
low
,
dark
,
mysterious
,
blind
,
and
mute
,
under
the
upper
nave
which
was
*NL*
overflowing
with
light
and
reverberating
with
organs
and
bells
day
and
*NL*
night
.
Sometimes
it
was
a
sepulchre
.
In
palaces
,
in
fortresses
,
it
was
*NL*
a
prison
,
sometimes
a
sepulchre
also
,
sometimes
both
together
.
These
*NL*
mighty
buildings
,
whose
mode
of
formation
and
vegetation
we
have
*NL*
elsewhere
explained
,
had
not
simply
foundations
,
but
,
so
to
speak
,
*NL*
roots
which
ran
branching
through
the
soil
in
chambers
,
galleries
,
*NL*
and
staircases
,
like
the
construction
above
.
Thus
churches
,
palaces
,
*NL*
fortresses
,
had
the
earth
half
way
up
their
bodies
.
The
cellars
of
an
*NL*
edifice
formed
another
edifice
,
into
which
one
descended
instead
*NL*
of
ascending
,
and
which
extended
its
subterranean
grounds
under
the
*NL*
external
piles
of
the
monument
,
like
those
forests
and
mountains
which
*NL*
are
reversed
in
the
mirror-like
waters
of
a
lake
,
beneath
the
forests
*NL*
and
mountains
of
the
banks
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
fortress
of
Saint-Antoine
,
at
the
Palais
de
Justice
of
Paris
,
*NL*
at
the
Louvre
,
these
subterranean
edifices
were
prisons
.
The
stories
of
*NL*
these
prisons
,
as
they
sank
into
the
soil
,
grew
constantly
narrower
and
*NL*
more
gloomy
.
They
were
so
many
zones
,
where
the
shades
of
horror
were
*NL*
graduated
.
Dante
could
never
imagine
anything
better
for
his
hell
.
These
*NL*
tunnels
of
cells
usually
terminated
in
a
sack
of
a
lowest
dungeon
,
with
*NL*
a
vat-like
bottom
,
where
Dante
placed
Satan
,
where
society
placed
those
*NL*
condemned
to
death
.
A
miserable
human
existence
,
once
interred
there
;
*NL*
farewell
light
,
air
,
life
,
_
ogni
speranza
_
--
every
hope
;
it
only
came
*NL*
forth
to
the
scaffold
or
the
stake
.
Sometimes
it
rotted
there
;
human
*NL*
justice
called
this
``
forgetting
.
''
Between
men
and
himself
,
the
condemned
*NL*
man
felt
a
pile
of
stones
and
jailers
weighing
down
upon
his
head
;
*NL*
and
the
entire
prison
,
the
massive
bastille
was
nothing
more
than
an
*NL*
enormous
,
complicated
lock
,
which
barred
him
off
from
the
rest
of
the
*NL*
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
a
sloping
cavity
of
this
description
,
in
the
_
oubliettes
_
*NL*
excavated
by
Saint-Louis
,
in
the
_
inpace
_
of
the
Tournelle
,
that
la
*NL*
Esmeralda
had
been
placed
on
being
condemned
to
death
,
through
fear
of
*NL*
her
escape
,
no
doubt
,
with
the
colossal
court-house
over
her
head
.
Poor
*NL*
fly
,
who
could
not
have
lifted
even
one
of
its
blocks
of
stone
!
*NL*
*NL*
Assuredly
,
Providence
and
society
had
been
equally
unjust
;
such
an
*NL*
excess
of
unhappiness
and
of
torture
was
not
necessary
to
break
so
frail
*NL*
a
creature
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
she
lay
,
lost
in
the
shadows
,
buried
,
hidden
,
immured
.
Any
one
*NL*
who
could
have
beheld
her
in
this
state
,
after
having
seen
her
laugh
and
*NL*
dance
in
the
sun
,
would
have
shuddered
.
Cold
as
night
,
cold
as
death
,
*NL*
not
a
breath
of
air
in
her
tresses
,
not
a
human
sound
in
her
ear
,
*NL*
no
longer
a
ray
of
light
in
her
eyes
;
snapped
in
twain
,
crushed
with
*NL*
chains
,
crouching
beside
a
jug
and
a
loaf
,
on
a
little
straw
,
in
a
*NL*
pool
of
water
,
which
was
formed
under
her
by
the
sweating
of
the
prison
*NL*
walls
;
without
motion
,
almost
without
breath
,
she
had
no
longer
the
*NL*
power
to
suffer
;
Phoebus
,
the
sun
,
midday
,
the
open
air
,
the
streets
of
*NL*
Paris
,
the
dances
with
applause
,
the
sweet
babblings
of
love
with
the
*NL*
officer
;
then
the
priest
,
the
old
crone
,
the
poignard
,
the
blood
,
*NL*
the
torture
,
the
gibbet
;
all
this
did
,
indeed
,
pass
before
her
mind
,
*NL*
sometimes
as
a
charming
and
golden
vision
,
sometimes
as
a
hideous
*NL*
nightmare
;
but
it
was
no
longer
anything
but
a
vague
and
horrible
*NL*
struggle
,
lost
in
the
gloom
,
or
distant
music
played
up
above
ground
,
*NL*
and
which
was
no
longer
audible
at
the
depth
where
the
unhappy
girl
had
*NL*
fallen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
she
had
been
there
,
she
had
neither
waked
nor
slept
.
In
that
*NL*
misfortune
,
in
that
cell
,
she
could
no
longer
distinguish
her
waking
*NL*
hours
from
slumber
,
dreams
from
reality
,
any
more
than
day
from
night
.
*NL*
All
this
was
mixed
,
broken
,
floating
,
disseminated
confusedly
in
her
*NL*
thought
.
She
no
longer
felt
,
she
no
longer
knew
,
she
no
longer
thought
;
*NL*
at
the
most
,
she
only
dreamed
.
Never
had
a
living
creature
been
thrust
*NL*
more
deeply
into
nothingness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
benumbed
,
frozen
,
petrified
,
she
had
barely
noticed
on
two
or
three
*NL*
occasions
,
the
sound
of
a
trap
door
opening
somewhere
above
her
,
without
*NL*
even
permitting
the
passage
of
a
little
light
,
and
through
which
a
hand
*NL*
had
tossed
her
a
bit
of
black
bread
.
Nevertheless
,
this
periodical
*NL*
visit
of
the
jailer
was
the
sole
communication
which
was
left
her
with
*NL*
mankind
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
single
thing
still
mechanically
occupied
her
ear
;
above
her
head
,
the
*NL*
dampness
was
filtering
through
the
mouldy
stones
of
the
vault
,
and
*NL*
a
drop
of
water
dropped
from
them
at
regular
intervals
.
She
listened
*NL*
stupidly
to
the
noise
made
by
this
drop
of
water
as
it
fell
into
the
*NL*
pool
beside
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
drop
of
water
falling
from
time
to
time
into
that
pool
,
was
the
*NL*
only
movement
which
still
went
on
around
her
,
the
only
clock
which
*NL*
marked
the
time
,
the
only
noise
which
reached
her
of
all
the
noise
made
*NL*
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
tell
the
whole
,
however
,
she
also
felt
,
from
time
to
time
,
in
that
*NL*
cesspool
of
mire
and
darkness
,
something
cold
passing
over
her
foot
or
*NL*
her
arm
,
and
she
shuddered
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
long
had
she
been
there
?
She
did
not
know
.
She
had
a
recollection
*NL*
of
a
sentence
of
death
pronounced
somewhere
,
against
some
one
,
then
*NL*
of
having
been
herself
carried
away
,
and
of
waking
up
in
darkness
and
*NL*
silence
,
chilled
to
the
heart
.
She
had
dragged
herself
along
on
her
*NL*
hands
.
Then
iron
rings
that
cut
her
ankles
,
and
chains
had
rattled
.
She
*NL*
had
recognized
the
fact
that
all
around
her
was
wall
,
that
below
her
*NL*
there
was
a
pavement
covered
with
moisture
and
a
truss
of
straw
;
but
*NL*
neither
lamp
nor
air-hole
.
Then
she
had
seated
herself
on
that
straw
*NL*
and
,
sometimes
,
for
the
sake
of
changing
her
attitude
,
on
the
last
*NL*
stone
step
in
her
dungeon
.
For
a
while
she
had
tried
to
count
the
black
*NL*
minutes
measured
off
for
her
by
the
drop
of
water
;
but
that
melancholy
*NL*
labor
of
an
ailing
brain
had
broken
off
of
itself
in
her
head
,
and
had
*NL*
left
her
in
stupor
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
,
one
day
,
or
one
night
,
-LRB-
for
midnight
and
midday
were
of
the
*NL*
same
color
in
that
sepulchre
-RRB-
,
she
heard
above
her
a
louder
noise
than
*NL*
was
usually
made
by
the
turnkey
when
he
brought
her
bread
and
jug
of
*NL*
water
.
She
raised
her
head
,
and
beheld
a
ray
of
reddish
light
passing
*NL*
through
the
crevices
in
the
sort
of
trapdoor
contrived
in
the
roof
of
*NL*
the
_
inpace
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
time
,
the
heavy
lock
creaked
,
the
trap
grated
on
its
rusty
*NL*
hinges
,
turned
,
and
she
beheld
a
lantern
,
a
hand
,
and
the
lower
portions
*NL*
of
the
bodies
of
two
men
,
the
door
being
too
low
to
admit
of
her
seeing
*NL*
their
heads
.
The
light
pained
her
so
acutely
that
she
shut
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
opened
them
again
the
door
was
closed
,
the
lantern
was
*NL*
deposited
on
one
of
the
steps
of
the
staircase
;
a
man
alone
stood
before
*NL*
her
.
A
monk
's
black
cloak
fell
to
his
feet
,
a
cowl
of
the
same
color
*NL*
concealed
his
face
.
Nothing
was
visible
of
his
person
,
neither
face
nor
*NL*
hands
.
It
was
a
long
,
black
shroud
standing
erect
,
and
beneath
which
*NL*
something
could
be
felt
moving
.
She
gazed
fixedly
for
several
minutes
*NL*
at
this
sort
of
spectre
.
But
neither
he
nor
she
spoke
.
One
would
have
*NL*
pronounced
them
two
statues
confronting
each
other
.
Two
things
only
*NL*
seemed
alive
in
that
cavern
;
the
wick
of
the
lantern
,
which
sputtered
*NL*
on
account
of
the
dampness
of
the
atmosphere
,
and
the
drop
of
water
*NL*
from
the
roof
,
which
cut
this
irregular
sputtering
with
its
monotonous
*NL*
splash
,
and
made
the
light
of
the
lantern
quiver
in
concentric
waves
on
*NL*
the
oily
water
of
the
pool
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
the
prisoner
broke
the
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
priest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
words
,
the
accent
,
the
sound
of
his
voice
made
her
tremble
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
priest
continued
,
in
a
hollow
voice
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
prepared
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
die
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
said
she
,
``
will
it
be
soon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
head
,
which
had
been
raised
with
joy
,
fell
back
upon
her
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
very
far
away
yet
!
''
she
murmured
;
``
why
could
they
not
have
done
it
*NL*
to-day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
are
very
unhappy
?
''
asked
the
priest
,
after
a
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
cold
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
her
feet
in
her
hands
,
a
gesture
habitual
with
unhappy
wretches
*NL*
who
are
cold
,
as
we
have
already
seen
in
the
case
of
the
recluse
of
the
*NL*
Tour-Roland
,
and
her
teeth
chattered
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
priest
appeared
to
cast
his
eyes
around
the
dungeon
from
beneath
his
*NL*
cowl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Without
light
!
without
fire
!
in
the
water
!
it
is
horrible
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
replied
,
with
the
bewildered
air
which
unhappiness
had
given
*NL*
her
.
``
The
day
belongs
to
every
one
,
why
do
they
give
me
only
night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
''
resumed
the
priest
,
after
a
fresh
silence
,
``
why
you
are
*NL*
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
I
knew
once
,
''
she
said
,
passing
her
thin
fingers
over
her
*NL*
eyelids
,
as
though
to
aid
her
memory
,
``
but
I
know
no
longer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
she
began
to
weep
like
a
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
to
get
away
from
here
,
sir
.
I
am
cold
,
I
am
afraid
,
and
*NL*
there
are
creatures
which
crawl
over
my
body
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
follow
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
the
priest
took
her
arm
.
The
unhappy
girl
was
frozen
to
her
*NL*
very
soul
.
Yet
that
hand
produced
an
impression
of
cold
upon
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
she
murmured
,
''
't
is
the
icy
hand
of
death
.
Who
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
priest
threw
back
his
cowl
;
she
looked
.
It
was
the
sinister
visage
*NL*
which
had
so
long
pursued
her
;
that
demon
's
head
which
had
appeared
at
*NL*
la
Falourdel
's
,
above
the
head
of
her
adored
Phoebus
;
that
eye
which
she
*NL*
last
had
seen
glittering
beside
a
dagger
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
apparition
,
always
so
fatal
for
her
,
and
which
had
thus
driven
her
*NL*
on
from
misfortune
to
misfortune
,
even
to
torture
,
roused
her
from
her
*NL*
stupor
.
It
seemed
to
her
that
the
sort
of
veil
which
had
lain
thick
upon
*NL*
her
memory
was
rent
away
.
All
the
details
of
her
melancholy
adventure
,
*NL*
from
the
nocturnal
scene
at
la
Falourdel
's
to
her
condemnation
to
the
*NL*
Tournelle
,
recurred
to
her
memory
,
no
longer
vague
and
confused
as
*NL*
heretofore
,
but
distinct
,
harsh
,
clear
,
palpitating
,
terrible
.
These
*NL*
souvenirs
,
half
effaced
and
almost
obliterated
by
excess
of
suffering
,
*NL*
were
revived
by
the
sombre
figure
which
stood
before
her
,
as
the
*NL*
approach
of
fire
causes
letters
traced
upon
white
paper
with
invisible
*NL*
ink
,
to
start
out
perfectly
fresh
.
It
seemed
to
her
that
all
the
wounds
*NL*
of
her
heart
opened
and
bled
simultaneously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hah
!
''
she
cried
,
with
her
hands
on
her
eyes
,
and
a
convulsive
*NL*
trembling
,
''
't
is
the
priest
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
dropped
her
arms
in
discouragement
,
and
remained
seated
,
with
*NL*
lowered
head
,
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
,
mute
and
still
trembling
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
priest
gazed
at
her
with
the
eye
of
a
hawk
which
has
long
been
*NL*
soaring
in
a
circle
from
the
heights
of
heaven
over
a
poor
lark
cowering
*NL*
in
the
wheat
,
and
has
long
been
silently
contracting
the
formidable
*NL*
circles
of
his
flight
,
and
has
suddenly
swooped
down
upon
his
prey
like
*NL*
a
flash
of
lightning
,
and
holds
it
panting
in
his
talons
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
began
to
murmur
in
a
low
voice
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Finish
!
finish
!
the
last
blow
!
''
and
she
drew
her
head
down
in
terror
*NL*
between
her
shoulders
,
like
the
lamb
awaiting
the
blow
of
the
butcher
's
*NL*
axe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
inspire
you
with
horror
?
''
he
said
at
length
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
made
no
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
I
inspire
you
with
horror
?
''
he
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
lips
contracted
,
as
though
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
she
,
``
the
headsman
scoffs
at
the
condemned
.
Here
he
has
been
*NL*
pursuing
me
,
threatening
me
,
terrifying
me
for
months
!
Had
it
not
been
*NL*
for
him
,
my
God
,
how
happy
it
should
have
been
!
It
was
he
who
cast
me
*NL*
into
this
abyss
!
Oh
heavens
!
it
was
he
who
killed
him
!
my
Phoebus
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
,
bursting
into
sobs
,
and
raising
her
eyes
to
the
priest
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
wretch
,
who
are
you
?
What
have
I
done
to
you
?
Do
you
then
,
hate
me
*NL*
so
?
Alas
!
what
have
you
against
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
love
thee
!
''
cried
the
priest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
tears
suddenly
ceased
,
she
gazed
at
him
with
the
look
of
an
idiot
.
*NL*
He
had
fallen
on
his
knees
and
was
devouring
her
with
eyes
of
flame
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dost
thou
understand
?
I
love
thee
!
''
he
cried
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
love
!
''
said
the
unhappy
girl
with
a
shudder
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
resumed
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
love
of
a
damned
soul
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Both
remained
silent
for
several
minutes
,
crushed
beneath
the
weight
of
*NL*
their
emotions
;
he
maddened
,
she
stupefied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
''
said
the
priest
at
last
,
and
a
singular
calm
had
come
over
*NL*
him
;
``
you
shall
know
all
I
am
about
to
tell
you
that
which
I
have
*NL*
hitherto
hardly
dared
to
say
to
myself
,
when
furtively
interrogating
my
*NL*
conscience
at
those
deep
hours
of
the
night
when
it
is
so
dark
that
it
*NL*
seems
as
though
God
no
longer
saw
us
.
Listen
.
Before
I
knew
you
,
young
*NL*
girl
,
I
was
happy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
was
I
!
''
she
sighed
feebly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
interrupt
me
.
Yes
,
I
was
happy
,
at
least
I
believed
myself
to
be
*NL*
so
.
I
was
pure
,
my
soul
was
filled
with
limpid
light
.
No
head
was
raised
*NL*
more
proudly
and
more
radiantly
than
mine
.
Priests
consulted
me
on
*NL*
chastity
;
doctors
,
on
doctrines
.
Yes
,
science
was
all
in
all
to
me
;
it
*NL*
was
a
sister
to
me
,
and
a
sister
sufficed
.
Not
but
that
with
age
other
*NL*
ideas
came
to
me
.
More
than
once
my
flesh
had
been
moved
as
a
woman
's
*NL*
form
passed
by
.
That
force
of
sex
and
blood
which
,
in
the
madness
of
*NL*
youth
,
I
had
imagined
that
I
had
stifled
forever
had
,
more
than
once
,
*NL*
convulsively
raised
the
chain
of
iron
vows
which
bind
me
,
a
miserable
*NL*
wretch
,
to
the
cold
stones
of
the
altar
.
But
fasting
,
prayer
,
study
,
*NL*
the
mortifications
of
the
cloister
,
rendered
my
soul
mistress
of
my
body
*NL*
once
more
,
and
then
I
avoided
women
.
Moreover
,
I
had
but
to
open
a
book
,
*NL*
and
all
the
impure
mists
of
my
brain
vanished
before
the
splendors
of
*NL*
science
.
In
a
few
moments
,
I
felt
the
gross
things
of
earth
flee
far
*NL*
away
,
and
I
found
myself
once
more
calm
,
quieted
,
and
serene
,
in
the
*NL*
presence
of
the
tranquil
radiance
of
eternal
truth
.
As
long
as
the
demon
*NL*
sent
to
attack
me
only
vague
shadows
of
women
who
passed
occasionally
*NL*
before
my
eyes
in
church
,
in
the
streets
,
in
the
fields
,
and
who
hardly
*NL*
recurred
to
my
dreams
,
I
easily
vanquished
him
.
Alas
!
if
the
victory
has
*NL*
not
remained
with
me
,
it
is
the
fault
of
God
,
who
has
not
created
man
*NL*
and
the
demon
of
equal
force
.
Listen
.
One
day
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
priest
paused
,
and
the
prisoner
heard
sighs
of
anguish
break
*NL*
from
his
breast
with
a
sound
of
the
death
rattle
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
resumed
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
day
I
was
leaning
on
the
window
of
my
cell
.
What
book
was
I
reading
*NL*
then
?
Oh
!
all
that
is
a
whirlwind
in
my
head
.
I
was
reading
.
The
window
*NL*
opened
upon
a
Square
.
I
heard
a
sound
of
tambourine
and
music
.
Annoyed
*NL*
at
being
thus
disturbed
in
my
revery
,
I
glanced
into
the
Square
.
What
*NL*
I
beheld
,
others
saw
beside
myself
,
and
yet
it
was
not
a
spectacle
made
*NL*
for
human
eyes
.
There
,
in
the
middle
of
the
pavement
,
--
it
was
midday
,
*NL*
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
,
--
a
creature
was
dancing
.
A
creature
so
*NL*
beautiful
that
God
would
have
preferred
her
to
the
Virgin
and
have
*NL*
chosen
her
for
his
mother
and
have
wished
to
be
born
of
her
if
she
*NL*
had
been
in
existence
when
he
was
made
man
!
Her
eyes
were
black
and
*NL*
splendid
;
in
the
midst
of
her
black
locks
,
some
hairs
through
which
the
*NL*
sun
shone
glistened
like
threads
of
gold
.
Her
feet
disappeared
in
their
*NL*
movements
like
the
spokes
of
a
rapidly
turning
wheel
.
Around
her
head
,
*NL*
in
her
black
tresses
,
there
were
disks
of
metal
,
which
glittered
in
the
*NL*
sun
,
and
formed
a
coronet
of
stars
on
her
brow
.
Her
dress
thick
set
with
*NL*
spangles
,
blue
,
and
dotted
with
a
thousand
sparks
,
gleamed
like
a
summer
*NL*
night
.
Her
brown
,
supple
arms
twined
and
untwined
around
her
waist
,
like
*NL*
two
scarfs
.
The
form
of
her
body
was
surprisingly
beautiful
.
Oh
!
what
*NL*
a
resplendent
figure
stood
out
,
like
something
luminous
even
in
the
*NL*
sunlight
!
Alas
,
young
girl
,
it
was
thou
!
Surprised
,
intoxicated
,
*NL*
charmed
,
I
allowed
myself
to
gaze
upon
thee
.
I
looked
so
long
that
I
*NL*
suddenly
shuddered
with
terror
;
I
felt
that
fate
was
seizing
hold
of
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
priest
paused
for
a
moment
,
overcome
with
emotion
.
Then
he
*NL*
continued
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Already
half
fascinated
,
I
tried
to
cling
fast
to
something
and
hold
*NL*
myself
back
from
falling
.
I
recalled
the
snares
which
Satan
had
already
*NL*
set
for
me
.
The
creature
before
my
eyes
possessed
that
superhuman
beauty
*NL*
which
can
come
only
from
heaven
or
hell
.
It
was
no
simple
girl
made
with
*NL*
a
little
of
our
earth
,
and
dimly
lighted
within
by
the
vacillating
ray
*NL*
of
a
woman
's
soul
.
It
was
an
angel
!
but
of
shadows
and
flame
,
and
not
of
*NL*
light
.
At
the
moment
when
I
was
meditating
thus
,
I
beheld
beside
you
a
*NL*
goat
,
a
beast
of
witches
,
which
smiled
as
it
gazed
at
me
.
The
midday
sun
*NL*
gave
him
golden
horns
.
Then
I
perceived
the
snare
of
the
demon
,
and
I
no
*NL*
longer
doubted
that
you
had
come
from
hell
and
that
you
had
come
thence
*NL*
for
my
perdition
.
I
believed
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
priest
looked
the
prisoner
full
in
the
face
,
and
added
,
*NL*
coldly
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
it
still
.
Nevertheless
,
the
charm
operated
little
by
little
;
*NL*
your
dancing
whirled
through
my
brain
;
I
felt
the
mysterious
spell
*NL*
working
within
me
.
All
that
should
have
awakened
was
lulled
to
sleep
;
*NL*
and
like
those
who
die
in
the
snow
,
I
felt
pleasure
in
allowing
this
*NL*
sleep
to
draw
on
.
All
at
once
,
you
began
to
sing
.
What
could
I
do
,
*NL*
unhappy
wretch
?
Your
song
was
still
more
charming
than
your
dancing
.
I
*NL*
tried
to
flee
.
Impossible
.
I
was
nailed
,
rooted
to
the
spot
.
It
seemed
*NL*
to
me
that
the
marble
of
the
pavement
had
risen
to
my
knees
.
I
was
*NL*
forced
to
remain
until
the
end
.
My
feet
were
like
ice
,
my
head
was
on
*NL*
fire
.
At
last
you
took
pity
on
me
,
you
ceased
to
sing
,
you
disappeared
.
*NL*
The
reflection
of
the
dazzling
vision
,
the
reverberation
of
the
*NL*
enchanting
music
disappeared
by
degrees
from
my
eyes
and
my
ears
.
Then
I
*NL*
fell
back
into
the
embrasure
of
the
window
,
more
rigid
,
more
feeble
than
*NL*
a
statue
torn
from
its
base
.
The
vesper
bell
roused
me
.
I
drew
myself
*NL*
up
;
I
fled
;
but
alas
!
something
within
me
had
fallen
never
to
rise
*NL*
again
,
something
had
come
upon
me
from
which
I
could
not
flee
.

*NL*
*NL*
He
made
another
pause
and
went
on
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
dating
from
that
day
,
there
was
within
me
a
man
whom
I
did
not
*NL*
know
.
I
tried
to
make
use
of
all
my
remedies
.
The
cloister
,
the
altar
,
*NL*
work
,
books
,
--
follies
!
Oh
,
how
hollow
does
science
sound
when
one
in
*NL*
despair
dashes
against
it
a
head
full
of
passions
!
Do
you
know
,
young
*NL*
girl
,
what
I
saw
thenceforth
between
my
book
and
me
?
You
,
your
shade
,
*NL*
the
image
of
the
luminous
apparition
which
had
one
day
crossed
the
space
*NL*
before
me
.
But
this
image
had
no
longer
the
same
color
;
it
was
sombre
,
*NL*
funereal
,
gloomy
as
the
black
circle
which
long
pursues
the
vision
of
*NL*
the
imprudent
man
who
has
gazed
intently
at
the
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Unable
to
rid
myself
of
it
,
since
I
heard
your
song
humming
ever
in
*NL*
my
head
,
beheld
your
feet
dancing
always
on
my
breviary
,
felt
even
at
*NL*
night
,
in
my
dreams
,
your
form
in
contact
with
my
own
,
I
desired
to
see
*NL*
you
again
,
to
touch
you
,
to
know
who
you
were
,
to
see
whether
I
should
*NL*
really
find
you
like
the
ideal
image
which
I
had
retained
of
you
,
to
*NL*
shatter
my
dream
,
perchance
,
with
reality
.
At
all
events
,
I
hoped
that
*NL*
a
new
impression
would
efface
the
first
,
and
the
first
had
become
*NL*
insupportable
.
I
sought
you
.
I
saw
you
once
more
.
Calamity
!
When
I
had
*NL*
seen
you
twice
,
I
wanted
to
see
you
a
thousand
times
,
I
wanted
to
see
*NL*
you
always
.
Then
--
how
stop
myself
on
that
slope
of
hell
?
--
then
I
no
*NL*
longer
belonged
to
myself
.
The
other
end
of
the
thread
which
the
demon
*NL*
had
attached
to
my
wings
he
had
fastened
to
his
foot
.
I
became
vagrant
*NL*
and
wandering
like
yourself
.
I
waited
for
you
under
porches
,
I
stood
on
*NL*
the
lookout
for
you
at
the
street
corners
,
I
watched
for
you
from
the
*NL*
summit
of
my
tower
.
Every
evening
I
returned
to
myself
more
charmed
,
*NL*
more
despairing
,
more
bewitched
,
more
lost
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
learned
who
you
were
;
an
Egyptian
,
Bohemian
,
gypsy
,
zingara
.
How
*NL*
could
I
doubt
the
magic
?
Listen
.
I
hoped
that
a
trial
would
free
me
from
*NL*
the
charm
.
A
witch
enchanted
Bruno
d'Ast
;
he
had
her
burned
,
and
was
*NL*
cured
.
I
knew
it
.
I
wanted
to
try
the
remedy
.
First
I
tried
to
have
you
*NL*
forbidden
the
square
in
front
of
Notre-Dame
,
hoping
to
forget
you
if
you
*NL*
returned
no
more
.
You
paid
no
heed
to
it
.
You
returned
.
Then
the
idea
of
*NL*
abducting
you
occurred
to
me
.
One
night
I
made
the
attempt
.
There
were
*NL*
two
of
us
.
We
already
had
you
in
our
power
,
when
that
miserable
officer
*NL*
came
up
.
He
delivered
you
.
Thus
did
he
begin
your
unhappiness
,
mine
,
and
*NL*
his
own
.
Finally
,
no
longer
knowing
what
to
do
,
and
what
was
to
become
*NL*
of
me
,
I
denounced
you
to
the
official
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
that
I
should
be
cured
like
Bruno
d'Ast
.
I
also
had
a
*NL*
confused
idea
that
a
trial
would
deliver
you
into
my
hands
;
that
,
as
a
*NL*
prisoner
I
should
hold
you
,
I
should
have
you
;
that
there
you
could
not
*NL*
escape
from
me
;
that
you
had
already
possessed
me
a
sufficiently
long
*NL*
time
to
give
me
the
right
to
possess
you
in
my
turn
.
When
one
does
*NL*
wrong
,
one
must
do
it
thoroughly
.
'T
is
madness
to
halt
midway
in
the
*NL*
monstrous
!
The
extreme
of
crime
has
its
deliriums
of
joy
.
A
priest
and
a
*NL*
witch
can
mingle
in
delight
upon
the
truss
of
straw
in
a
dungeon
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Accordingly
,
I
denounced
you
.
It
was
then
that
I
terrified
you
when
*NL*
we
met
.
The
plot
which
I
was
weaving
against
you
,
the
storm
which
I
*NL*
was
heaping
up
above
your
head
,
burst
from
me
in
threats
and
lightning
*NL*
glances
.
Still
,
I
hesitated
.
My
project
had
its
terrible
sides
which
*NL*
made
me
shrink
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
I
might
have
renounced
it
;
perhaps
my
hideous
thought
would
*NL*
have
withered
in
my
brain
,
without
bearing
fruit
.
I
thought
that
*NL*
it
would
always
depend
upon
me
to
follow
up
or
discontinue
this
*NL*
prosecution
.
But
every
evil
thought
is
inexorable
,
and
insists
on
*NL*
becoming
a
deed
;
but
where
I
believed
myself
to
be
all
powerful
,
fate
*NL*
was
more
powerful
than
I.
Alas
!
't
is
fate
which
has
seized
you
and
*NL*
delivered
you
to
the
terrible
wheels
of
the
machine
which
I
had
*NL*
constructed
doubly
.
Listen
.
I
am
nearing
the
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
day
,
--
again
the
sun
was
shining
brilliantly
--
I
behold
man
pass
me
*NL*
uttering
your
name
and
laughing
,
who
carries
sensuality
in
his
eyes

*NL*
Damnation
!
I
followed
him
;
you
know
the
rest

*NL*
*NL*
He
ceased

*NL*
The
young
girl
could
find
but
one
word
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
Phoebus
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
that
name

said
the
priest
,
grasping
her
arm
violently
.
``
Utter
not
*NL*
that
name

Oh

wretches
that

is
that
name

has
*NL*
ruined
us

rather
we
have
ruined

the
inexplicable
play
*NL*
of
fate

are
suffering

are
you
not

you
are
cold
;
the
night
makes
*NL*
you
blind
,
the
dungeon
envelops
you
;
but
perhaps
you
still
have
some
*NL*
light
in
the
bottom
of
your
soul
,
were
it
only
your
childish
love
for
*NL*
that
empty
man
who
played
with
your
heart
,
while
I
bear
the
dungeon
*NL*
within
me

within
me
there
is
winter

ice
,
despair

I
have
night

my
*NL*
soul

``
Do
you
know
what
I
have
suffered

was
present
at
your
trial

seated
on

official
's
bench

Yes

under
one
of
the
priests

cowls
,
*NL*
there
were
the
contortions
of
the
damned
.
When
you
were
brought
in
,
I
*NL*
was
there
;
when
you
were
questioned
,
I
was
there

--
Den
of
wolves

It
*NL*
was
my
crime
,
it
was
my
gallows
that
I
beheld
being
slowly
reared
over
*NL*
your
head
.
I
was
there
for
every
witness
,
every
proof
,
every
plea
;
I
*NL*
could
count
each
of
your
steps
in
the
painful
path
;
I
was
still
there
*NL*
when
that
ferocious
beast
--
oh
!
I
had
not
foreseen
torture
!
Listen
.
*NL*
I
followed
you
to
that
chamber
of
anguish
.
I
beheld
you
stripped
and
*NL*
handled
,
half
naked
,
by
the
infamous
hands
of
the
tormentor
.
I
beheld
*NL*
your
foot
,
that
foot
which
I
would
have
given
an
empire
to
kiss
and
die
,
*NL*
that
foot
,
beneath
which
to
have
had
my
head
crushed
I
should
have
felt
*NL*
such
rapture

I
beheld
it
encased
in
that
horrible
boot
,
which
converts
*NL*
the
limbs
of
a
living
being
into
one
bloody
clod

Oh

wretch

while
*NL*
I
looked
on
at
that
,
I
held
beneath
my
shroud
a
dagger
,
with
which
I
*NL*
lacerated
my
breast
.
When
you
uttered
that
cry
,
I
plunged
it
into
my
*NL*
flesh
;
at
a
second
cry
,
it
would
have
entered
my
heart

Look

I
believe

that
it
still
bleeds

He
opened
his
cassock

His
breast
was
in
fact

mangled
as
by
the
claw
of
*NL*
a
tiger

on
his
side
he
had
a

writhed

against
the
*NL*
corners
of
the
stone
steps
.
The
young
girl
gazed
at
him
,
and
listened
to
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
ceased
,
exhausted
and
panting
,
she
repeated
in
a
low
voice
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
my
Phoebus
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
priest
dragged
himself
towards
her
on
his
knees
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beseech
you
,
''
he
cried
,
``
if
you
have
any
heart
,
do
not
repulse
me
!
*NL*
Oh
!
I
love
you
!
I
am
a
wretch
!
When
you
utter
that
name
,
unhappy
girl
,
*NL*
it
is
as
though
you
crushed
all
the
fibres
of
my
heart
between
your
*NL*
teeth
.
Mercy
!
If
you
come
from
hell
I
will
go
thither
with
you
.
I
have
*NL*
done
everything
to
that
end
.
The
hell
where
you
are
,
shall
he
paradise
;
*NL*
the
sight
of
you
is
more
charming
than
that
of
God
!
Oh
!
speak
!
you
will
*NL*
have
none
of
me
?
I
should
have
thought
the
mountains
would
be
shaken
in
*NL*
their
foundations
on
the
day
when
a
woman
would
repulse
such
a
love
.
*NL*
Oh
!
if
you
only
would
!
Oh
!
how
happy
we
might
be
.
We
would
flee
--
I
would
*NL*
help
you
to
flee
,
--
we
would
go
somewhere
,
we
would
seek
that
spot
on
*NL*
earth
,
where
the
sun
is
brightest
,
the
sky
the
bluest
,
where
the
trees
*NL*
are
most
luxuriant
.
We
would
love
each
other
,
we
would
pour
our
two
*NL*
souls
into
each
other
,
and
we
would
have
a
thirst
for
ourselves
which
we
*NL*
would
quench
in
common
and
incessantly
at
that
fountain
of
inexhaustible
*NL*
love
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
interrupted
with
a
terrible
and
thrilling
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
,
father
,
you
have
blood
on
your
fingers
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
priest
remained
for
several
moments
as
though
petrified
,
with
his
*NL*
eyes
fixed
upon
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
yes
!
''
he
resumed
at
last
,
with
strange
gentleness
,
``
insult
me
,
*NL*
scoff
at
me
,
overwhelm
me
with
scorn
!
but
come
,
come
.
Let
us
make
haste
.
*NL*
It
is
to
be
to-morrow
,
I
tell
you
.
The
gibbet
on
the
Greve
,
you
know
it
?
*NL*
it
stands
always
ready
.
It
is
horrible
!
to
see
you
ride
in
that
tumbrel
!
*NL*
Oh
mercy
!
Until
now
I
have
never
felt
the
power
of
my
love
for
you
.
--
Oh
!
*NL*
follow
me
.
You
shall
take
your
time
to
love
me
after
I
have
saved
you
.
*NL*
You
shall
hate
me
as
long
as
you
will
.
But
come
.
To-morrow
!
to-morrow
!
*NL*
the
gallows
!
your
execution
!
Oh
!
save
yourself
!
spare
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
seized
her
arm
,
he
was
beside
himself
,
he
tried
to
drag
her
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
fixed
her
eye
intently
on
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
has
become
of
my
Phoebus
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
the
priest
,
releasing
her
arm
,
``
you
are
pitiless
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
has
become
of
Phoebus
?
''
she
repeated
coldly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
dead
!
''
cried
the
priest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dead
!
''
said
she
,
still
icy
and
motionless
``
then
why
do
you
talk
to
me
*NL*
of
living
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
not
listening
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
yes
,
''
said
he
,
as
though
speaking
to
himself
,
``
he
certainly
must
be
*NL*
dead
.
The
blade
pierced
deeply
.
I
believe
I
touched
his
heart
with
the
*NL*
point
.
Oh
!
my
very
soul
was
at
the
end
of
the
dagger
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
girl
flung
herself
upon
him
like
a
raging
tigress
,
and
pushed
*NL*
him
upon
the
steps
of
the
staircase
with
supernatural
force
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Begone
,
monster
!
Begone
,
assassin
!
Leave
me
to
die
!
May
the
blood
*NL*
of
both
of
us
make
an
eternal
stain
upon
your
brow
!
Be
thine
,
priest
!
*NL*
Never
!
never
!
Nothing
shall
unite
us
!
not
hell
itself
!
Go
,
accursed
man
!
*NL*
Never
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
priest
had
stumbled
on
the
stairs
.
He
silently
disentangled
his
*NL*
feet
from
the
folds
of
his
robe
,
picked
up
his
lantern
again
,
and
slowly
*NL*
began
the
ascent
of
the
steps
which
led
to
the
door
;
he
opened
the
door
*NL*
and
passed
through
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
,
the
young
girl
beheld
his
head
reappear
;
it
wore
a
*NL*
frightful
expression
,
and
he
cried
,
hoarse
with
rage
and
despair
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
he
is
dead
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
fell
face
downwards
upon
the
floor
,
and
there
was
no
longer
any
*NL*
sound
audible
in
the
cell
than
the
sob
of
the
drop
of
water
which
made
*NL*
the
pool
palpitate
amid
the
darkness

CHAPTER
V
.
THE
MOTHER
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
not
believe
that
there
is
anything
sweeter
in
the
world
than
the
*NL*
ideas
which
awake
in
a
mother
's
heart
at
the
sight
of
her
child
's
tiny
*NL*
shoe
;
especially
if
it
is
a
shoe
for
festivals
,
for
Sunday
,
for
baptism
,
*NL*
the
shoe
embroidered
to
the
very
sole
,
a
shoe
in
which
the
infant
has
*NL*
not
yet
taken
a
step
.
That
shoe
has
so
much
grace
and
daintiness
,
it
is
*NL*
so
impossible
for
it
to
walk
,
that
it
seems
to
the
mother
as
though
she
*NL*
saw
her
child
.
She
smiles
upon
it
,
she
kisses
it
,
she
talks
to
it
;
she
*NL*
asks
herself
whether
there
can
actually
be
a
foot
so
tiny
;
and
if
the
*NL*
child
be
absent
,
the
pretty
shoe
suffices
to
place
the
sweet
and
fragile
*NL*
creature
before
her
eyes
.
She
thinks
she
sees
it
,
she
does
see
it
,
*NL*
complete
,
living
,
joyous
,
with
its
delicate
hands
,
its
round
head
,
its
*NL*
pure
lips
,
its
serene
eyes
whose
white
is
blue
.
If
it
is
in
winter
,
it
*NL*
is
yonder
,
crawling
on
the
carpet
,
it
is
laboriously
climbing
upon
an
*NL*
ottoman
,
and
the
mother
trembles
lest
it
should
approach
the
fire
.
If
it
*NL*
is
summer
time
,
it
crawls
about
the
yard
,
in
the
garden
,
plucks
up
the
*NL*
grass
between
the
paving-stones
,
gazes
innocently
at
the
big
dogs
,
the
*NL*
big
horses
,
without
fear
,
plays
with
the
shells
,
with
the
flowers
,
and
*NL*
makes
the
gardener
grumble
because
he
finds
sand
in
the
flower-beds
and
*NL*
earth
in
the
paths
.
Everything
laughs
,
and
shines
and
plays
around
it
,
*NL*
like
it
,
even
the
breath
of
air
and
the
ray
of
sun
which
vie
with
each
*NL*
other
in
disporting
among
the
silky
ringlets
of
its
hair
.
The
shoe
shows
*NL*
all
this
to
the
mother
,
and
makes
her
heart
melt
as
fire
melts
wax
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
the
child
is
lost
,
these
thousand
images
of
joy
,
of
charms
,
of
*NL*
tenderness
,
which
throng
around
the
little
shoe
,
become
so
many
*NL*
horrible
things
.
The
pretty
broidered
shoe
is
no
longer
anything
but
an
*NL*
instrument
of
torture
which
eternally
crushes
the
heart
of
the
mother
.
*NL*
It
is
always
the
same
fibre
which
vibrates
,
the
tenderest
and
most
*NL*
sensitive
;
but
instead
of
an
angel
caressing
it
,
it
is
a
demon
who
is
*NL*
wrenching
at
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
May
morning
,
when
the
sun
was
rising
on
one
of
those
dark
blue
skies
*NL*
against
which
Garofolo
loves
to
place
his
Descents
from
the
Cross
,
the
*NL*
recluse
of
the
Tour-Roland
heard
a
sound
of
wheels
,
of
horses
and
irons
*NL*
in
the
Place
de
Greve
.
She
was
somewhat
aroused
by
it
,
knotted
her
hair
*NL*
upon
her
ears
in
order
to
deafen
herself
,
and
resumed
her
contemplation
,
*NL*
on
her
knees
,
of
the
inanimate
object
which
she
had
adored
for
fifteen
*NL*
years
.
This
little
shoe
was
the
universe
to
her
,
as
we
have
already
*NL*
said
.
Her
thought
was
shut
up
in
it
,
and
was
destined
never
more
to
quit
*NL*
it
except
at
death
.
The
sombre
cave
of
the
Tour-Roland
alone
knew
how
*NL*
many
bitter
imprecations
,
touching
complaints
,
prayers
and
sobs
she
had
*NL*
wafted
to
heaven
in
connection
with
that
charming
bauble
of
rose-colored
*NL*
satin
.
Never
was
more
despair
bestowed
upon
a
prettier
and
more
graceful
*NL*
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
as
though
her
grief
were
breaking
forth
more
violently
than
*NL*
usual
;
and
she
could
be
heard
outside
lamenting
in
a
loud
and
monotonous
*NL*
voice
which
rent
the
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
my
daughter
!
''
she
said
,
``
my
daughter
,
my
poor
,
dear
little
child
,
so
*NL*
I
shall
never
see
thee
more
!
It
is
over
!
It
always
seems
to
me
that
it
*NL*
happened
yesterday
!
My
God
!
my
God
!
it
would
have
been
better
not
to
*NL*
give
her
to
me
than
to
take
her
away
so
soon
.
Did
you
not
know
that
our
*NL*
children
are
part
of
ourselves
,
and
that
a
mother
who
has
lost
her
child
*NL*
no
longer
believes
in
God
?
Ah
!
wretch
that
I
am
to
have
gone
out
that
*NL*
day
!
Lord
!
Lord
!
to
have
taken
her
from
me
thus
;
you
could
never
have
*NL*
looked
at
me
with
her
,
when
I
was
joyously
warming
her
at
my
fire
,
when
*NL*
she
laughed
as
she
suckled
,
when
I
made
her
tiny
feet
creep
up
my
breast
*NL*
to
my
lips
?
Oh
!
if
you
had
looked
at
that
,
my
God
,
you
would
have
taken
*NL*
pity
on
my
joy
;
you
would
not
have
taken
from
me
the
only
love
which
*NL*
lingered
,
in
my
heart
!
Was
I
then
,
Lord
,
so
miserable
a
creature
,
that
*NL*
you
could
not
look
at
me
before
condemning
me
?
--
Alas
!
Alas
!
here
is
*NL*
the
shoe
;
where
is
the
foot
?
where
is
the
rest
?
Where
is
the
child
?
My
*NL*
daughter
!
my
daughter
!
what
did
they
do
with
thee
?
Lord
,
give
her
back
*NL*
to
me
.
My
knees
have
been
worn
for
fifteen
years
in
praying
to
thee
,
*NL*
my
God
!
Is
not
that
enough
?
Give
her
back
to
me
one
day
,
one
hour
,
*NL*
one
minute
;
one
minute
,
Lord
!
and
then
cast
me
to
the
demon
for
all
*NL*
eternity
!
Oh
!
if
I
only
knew
where
the
skirt
of
your
garment
trails
,
I
*NL*
would
cling
to
it
with
both
hands
,
and
you
would
be
obliged
to
give
me
*NL*
back
my
child
!
Have
you
no
pity
on
her
pretty
little
shoe
?
Could
you
*NL*
condemn
a
poor
mother
to
this
torture
for
fifteen
years
?
Good
Virgin
!
*NL*
good
Virgin
of
heaven
!
my
infant
Jesus
has
been
taken
from
me
,
has
been
*NL*
stolen
from
me
;
they
devoured
her
on
a
heath
,
they
drank
her
blood
,
they
*NL*
cracked
her
bones
!
Good
Virgin
,
have
pity
upon
me
.
My
daughter
,
I
want
*NL*
my
daughter
!
What
is
it
to
me
that
she
is
in
paradise
?
I
do
not
want
*NL*
your
angel
,
I
want
my
child
!
I
am
a
lioness
,
I
want
my
whelp
.
Oh
!
I
will
*NL*
writhe
on
the
earth
,
I
will
break
the
stones
with
my
forehead
,
and
I
*NL*
will
damn
myself
,
and
I
will
curse
you
,
Lord
,
if
you
keep
my
child
from
*NL*
me
!
you
see
plainly
that
my
arms
are
all
bitten
,
Lord
!
Has
the
good
God
*NL*
no
mercy
?
--
Oh
!
give
me
only
salt
and
black
bread
,
only
let
me
have
my
*NL*
daughter
to
warm
me
like
a
sun
!
Alas
!
Lord
my
God
.
Alas
!
Lord
my
God
,
*NL*
I
am
only
a
vile
sinner
;
but
my
daughter
made
me
pious
.
I
was
full
of
*NL*
religion
for
the
love
of
her
,
and
I
beheld
you
through
her
smile
as
*NL*
through
an
opening
into
heaven
.
Oh
!
if
I
could
only
once
,
just
once
*NL*
more
,
a
single
time
,
put
this
shoe
on
her
pretty
little
pink
foot
,
I
*NL*
would
die
blessing
you
,
good
Virgin
.
Ah
!
fifteen
years
!
she
will
be
*NL*
grown
up
now
!
--
Unhappy
child
!
what
!
it
is
really
true
then
I
shall
never
*NL*
see
her
more
,
not
even
in
heaven
,
for
I
shall
not
go
there
myself
.
Oh
!
*NL*
what
misery
to
think
that
here
is
her
shoe
,
and
that
that
is
all
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
unhappy
woman
flung
herself
upon
that
shoe
;
her
consolation
and
her
*NL*
despair
for
so
many
years
,
and
her
vitals
were
rent
with
sobs
as
on
the
*NL*
first
day
;
because
,
for
a
mother
who
has
lost
her
child
,
it
is
always
*NL*
the
first
day
.
That
grief
never
grows
old
.
The
mourning
garments
may
*NL*
grow
white
and
threadbare
,
the
heart
remains
dark
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
,
the
fresh
and
joyous
cries
of
children
passed
in
front
*NL*
of
the
cell
.
Every
time
that
children
crossed
her
vision
or
struck
*NL*
her
ear
,
the
poor
mother
flung
herself
into
the
darkest
corner
of
her
*NL*
sepulchre
,
and
one
would
have
said
,
that
she
sought
to
plunge
her
head
*NL*
into
the
stone
in
order
not
to
hear
them
.
This
time
,
on
the
contrary
,
*NL*
she
drew
herself
upright
with
a
start
,
and
listened
eagerly
.
One
of
the
*NL*
little
boys
had
just
said
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
going
to
hang
a
gypsy
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
abrupt
leap
of
that
spider
which
we
have
seen
fling
itself
upon
*NL*
a
fly
at
the
trembling
of
its
web
,
she
rushed
to
her
air-hole
,
which
*NL*
opened
as
the
reader
knows
,
on
the
Place
de
Greve
.
A
ladder
had
,
in
*NL*
fact
,
been
raised
up
against
the
permanent
gibbet
,
and
the
hangman
's
*NL*
assistant
was
busying
himself
with
adjusting
the
chains
which
had
been
*NL*
rusted
by
the
rain
.
There
were
some
people
standing
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
laughing
group
of
children
was
already
far
away
.
The
sacked
nun
*NL*
sought
with
her
eyes
some
passer-by
whom
she
might
question
.
All
at
*NL*
once
,
beside
her
cell
,
she
perceived
a
priest
making
a
pretext
of
*NL*
reading
the
public
breviary
,
but
who
was
much
less
occupied
with
the
*NL*
``
lectern
of
latticed
iron
,
''
than
with
the
gallows
,
toward
which
he
cast
*NL*
a
fierce
and
gloomy
glance
from
time
to
time
.
She
recognized
monsieur
*NL*
the
archdeacon
of
Josas
,
a
holy
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
,
''
she
inquired
,
``
whom
are
they
about
to
hang
yonder
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
priest
looked
at
her
and
made
no
reply
;
she
repeated
her
question
.
*NL*
Then
he
said
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
children
said
that
it
was
a
gypsy
,
''
went
on
the
recluse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
so
,
''
said
the
priest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Paquette
la
Chantefleurie
burst
into
hyena-like
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sister
,
''
said
the
archdeacon
,
``
do
you
then
hate
the
gypsies
heartily
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
I
hate
them
!
''
exclaimed
the
recluse
,
``
they
are
vampires
,
stealers
*NL*
of
children
!
They
devoured
my
little
daughter
,
my
child
,
my
only
child
!
*NL*
I
have
no
longer
any
heart
,
they
devoured
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
frightful
.
The
priest
looked
at
her
coldly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
one
in
particular
whom
I
hate
,
and
whom
I
have
cursed
,
''
she
*NL*
resumed
;
``
it
is
a
young
one
,
of
the
age
which
my
daughter
would
be
if
*NL*
her
mother
had
not
eaten
my
daughter
.
Every
time
that
that
young
viper
*NL*
passes
in
front
of
my
cell
,
she
sets
my
blood
in
a
ferment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sister
,
rejoice
,
''
said
the
priest
,
icy
as
a
sepulchral
statue
;
*NL*
``
that
is
the
one
whom
you
are
about
to
see
die
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
head
fell
upon
his
bosom
and
he
moved
slowly
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
recluse
writhed
her
arms
with
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
predicted
it
for
her
,
that
she
would
ascend
thither
!
Thanks
,
priest
!
''
*NL*
she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
began
to
pace
up
and
down
with
long
strides
before
the
grating
*NL*
of
her
window
,
her
hair
dishevelled
,
her
eyes
flashing
,
with
her
*NL*
shoulder
striking
against
the
wall
,
with
the
wild
air
of
a
female
wolf
*NL*
in
a
cage
,
who
has
long
been
famished
,
and
who
feels
the
hour
for
her
*NL*
repast
drawing
near
.

CHAPTER
VI
.
THREE
HUMAN
HEARTS
DIFFERENTLY
CONSTRUCTED
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Phoebus
was
not
dead
,
however
.
Men
of
that
stamp
die
hard
.
When
Master
*NL*
Philippe
Lheulier
,
advocate
extraordinary
of
the
king
,
had
said
to
poor
*NL*
Esmeralda
;
``
He
is
dying
,
''
it
was
an
error
or
a
jest
.
When
the
archdeacon
*NL*
had
repeated
to
the
condemned
girl
;
``
He
is
dead
,
''
the
fact
is
that
he
*NL*
knew
nothing
about
it
,
but
that
he
believed
it
,
that
he
counted
on
it
,
*NL*
that
he
did
not
doubt
it
,
that
he
devoutly
hoped
it
.
It
would
have
been
*NL*
too
hard
for
him
to
give
favorable
news
of
his
rival
to
the
woman
whom
*NL*
he
loved
.
Any
man
would
have
done
the
same
in
his
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
that
Phoebus
's
wound
had
not
been
serious
,
but
it
had
not
*NL*
been
as
much
so
as
the
archdeacon
believed
.
The
physician
,
to
whom
the
*NL*
soldiers
of
the
watch
had
carried
him
at
the
first
moment
,
had
feared
*NL*
for
his
life
during
the
space
of
a
week
,
and
had
even
told
him
so
in
*NL*
Latin
.
But
youth
had
gained
the
upper
hand
;
and
,
as
frequently
happens
,
*NL*
in
spite
of
prognostications
and
diagnoses
,
nature
had
amused
herself
by
*NL*
saving
the
sick
man
under
the
physician
's
very
nose
.
It
was
while
he
*NL*
was
still
lying
on
the
leech
's
pallet
that
he
had
submitted
to
the
*NL*
interrogations
of
Philippe
Lheulier
and
the
official
inquisitors
,
*NL*
which
had
annoyed
him
greatly
.
Hence
,
one
fine
morning
,
feeling
himself
*NL*
better
,
he
had
left
his
golden
spurs
with
the
leech
as
payment
,
and
had
*NL*
slipped
away
.
This
had
not
,
however
,
interfered
with
the
progress
of
the
*NL*
affair
.
Justice
,
at
that
epoch
,
troubled
itself
very
little
about
the
*NL*
clearness
and
definiteness
of
a
criminal
suit
.
Provided
that
the
accused
*NL*
was
hung
,
that
was
all
that
was
necessary
.
Now
the
judge
had
plenty
of
*NL*
proofs
against
la
Esmeralda
.
They
had
supposed
Phoebus
to
be
dead
,
and
*NL*
that
was
the
end
of
the
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Phoebus
,
on
his
side
,
had
not
fled
far
.
He
had
simply
rejoined
his
*NL*
company
in
garrison
at
Queue-en-Brie
,
in
the
Isle-de-France
,
a
few
*NL*
stages
from
Paris
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
all
,
it
did
not
please
him
in
the
least
to
appear
in
this
suit
.
*NL*
He
had
a
vague
feeling
that
he
should
play
a
ridiculous
figure
in
it
.
*NL*
On
the
whole
,
he
did
not
know
what
to
think
of
the
whole
affair
.
*NL*
Superstitious
,
and
not
given
to
devoutness
,
like
every
soldier
who
is
*NL*
only
a
soldier
,
when
he
came
to
question
himself
about
this
adventure
,
*NL*
he
did
not
feel
assured
as
to
the
goat
,
as
to
the
singular
fashion
in
*NL*
which
he
had
met
La
Esmeralda
,
as
to
the
no
less
strange
manner
in
which
*NL*
she
had
allowed
him
to
divine
her
love
,
as
to
her
character
as
a
gypsy
,
*NL*
and
lastly
,
as
to
the
surly
monk
.
He
perceived
in
all
these
incidents
*NL*
much
more
magic
than
love
,
probably
a
sorceress
,
perhaps
the
devil
;
*NL*
a
comedy
,
in
short
,
or
to
speak
in
the
language
of
that
day
,
a
very
*NL*
disagreeable
mystery
,
in
which
he
played
a
very
awkward
part
,
the
role
*NL*
of
blows
and
derision
.
The
captain
was
quite
put
out
of
countenance
*NL*
about
it
;
he
experienced
that
sort
of
shame
which
our
La
Fontaine
has
so
*NL*
admirably
defined
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Ashamed
as
a
fox
who
has
been
caught
by
a
fowl
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
he
hoped
that
the
affair
would
not
get
noised
abroad
,
that
his
*NL*
name
would
hardly
be
pronounced
in
it
,
and
that
in
any
case
it
would
*NL*
not
go
beyond
the
courts
of
the
Tournelle
.
In
this
he
was
not
mistaken
,
*NL*
there
was
then
no
``
Gazette
des
Tribunaux
;
''
and
as
not
a
week
passed
*NL*
which
had
not
its
counterfeiter
to
boil
,
or
its
witch
to
hang
,
or
its
*NL*
heretic
to
burn
,
at
some
one
of
the
innumerable
justices
of
Paris
,
*NL*
people
were
so
accustomed
to
seeing
in
all
the
squares
the
ancient
*NL*
feudal
Themis
,
bare
armed
,
with
sleeves
stripped
up
,
performing
her
duty
*NL*
at
the
gibbets
,
the
ladders
,
and
the
pillories
,
that
they
hardly
paid
*NL*
any
heed
to
it
.
Fashionable
society
of
that
day
hardly
knew
the
name
*NL*
of
the
victim
who
passed
by
at
the
corner
of
the
street
,
and
it
was
the
*NL*
populace
at
the
most
who
regaled
themselves
with
this
coarse
fare
.
An
*NL*
execution
was
an
habitual
incident
of
the
public
highways
,
like
the
*NL*
braising-pan
of
the
baker
or
the
slaughter-house
of
the
knacker
.
The
*NL*
executioner
was
only
a
sort
of
butcher
of
a
little
deeper
dye
than
the
*NL*
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hence
Phoebus
's
mind
was
soon
at
ease
on
the
score
of
the
enchantress
*NL*
Esmeralda
,
or
Similar
,
as
he
called
her
,
concerning
the
blow
from
the
*NL*
dagger
of
the
Bohemian
or
of
the
surly
monk
-LRB-
it
mattered
little
which
*NL*
to
him
-RRB-
,
and
as
to
the
issue
of
the
trial
.
But
as
soon
as
his
heart
was
*NL*
vacant
in
that
direction
,
Fleur-de-Lys
returned
to
it
.
Captain
Phoebus
's
*NL*
heart
,
like
the
physics
of
that
day
,
abhorred
a
vacuum
.
*NL*
*NL*
Queue-en-Brie
was
a
very
insipid
place
to
stay
at
then
,
a
village
*NL*
of
farriers
,
and
cow-girls
with
chapped
hands
,
a
long
line
of
poor
*NL*
dwellings
and
thatched
cottages
,
which
borders
the
grand
road
on
both
*NL*
sides
for
half
a
league
;
a
tail
-LRB-
queue
-RRB-
,
in
short
,
as
its
name
imports
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fleur-de-Lys
was
his
last
passion
but
one
,
a
pretty
girl
,
a
charming
*NL*
dowry
;
accordingly
,
one
fine
morning
,
quite
cured
,
and
assuming
that
,
*NL*
after
the
lapse
of
two
months
,
the
Bohemian
affair
must
be
completely
*NL*
finished
and
forgotten
,
the
amorous
cavalier
arrived
on
a
prancing
horse
*NL*
at
the
door
of
the
Gondelaurier
mansion
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
paid
no
attention
to
a
tolerably
numerous
rabble
which
had
assembled
*NL*
in
the
Place
du
Parvis
,
before
the
portal
of
Notre-Dame
;
he
remembered
*NL*
that
it
was
the
month
of
May
;
he
supposed
that
it
was
some
procession
,
*NL*
some
Pentecost
,
some
festival
,
hitched
his
horse
to
the
ring
at
the
*NL*
door
,
and
gayly
ascended
the
stairs
to
his
beautiful
betrothed
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
alone
with
her
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
scene
of
the
witch
,
her
goat
,
her
cursed
alphabet
,
and
Phoebus
's
*NL*
long
absences
,
still
weighed
on
Fleur-de-Lys
's
heart
.
Nevertheless
,
when
*NL*
she
beheld
her
captain
enter
,
she
thought
him
so
handsome
,
his
doublet
*NL*
so
new
,
his
baldrick
so
shining
,
and
his
air
so
impassioned
,
that
she
*NL*
blushed
with
pleasure
.
The
noble
damsel
herself
was
more
charming
than
*NL*
ever
.
Her
magnificent
blond
hair
was
plaited
in
a
ravishing
manner
,
she
*NL*
was
dressed
entirely
in
that
sky
blue
which
becomes
fair
people
so
well
,
*NL*
a
bit
of
coquetry
which
she
had
learned
from
Colombe
,
and
her
eyes
were
*NL*
swimming
in
that
languor
of
love
which
becomes
them
still
better
.
*NL*
*NL*
Phoebus
,
who
had
seen
nothing
in
the
line
of
beauty
,
since
he
left
the
*NL*
village
maids
of
Queue-en-Brie
,
was
intoxicated
with
Fleur-de-Lys
,
which
*NL*
imparted
to
our
officer
so
eager
and
gallant
an
air
,
that
his
peace
*NL*
was
immediately
made
.
Madame
de
Gondelaurier
herself
,
still
maternally
*NL*
seated
in
her
big
arm-chair
,
had
not
the
heart
to
scold
him
.
As
for
*NL*
Fleur-de-Lys
's
reproaches
,
they
expired
in
tender
cooings
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
girl
was
seated
near
the
window
still
embroidering
her
grotto
*NL*
of
Neptune
.
The
captain
was
leaning
over
the
back
of
her
chair
,
and
she
*NL*
was
addressing
her
caressing
reproaches
to
him
in
a
low
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
has
become
of
you
these
two
long
months
,
wicked
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
swear
to
you
,
''
replied
Phoebus
,
somewhat
embarrassed
by
the
question
,
*NL*
``
that
you
are
beautiful
enough
to
set
an
archbishop
to
dreaming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
not
repress
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
,
good
,
sir
.
Let
my
beauty
alone
and
answer
my
question
.
A
fine
*NL*
beauty
,
in
sooth
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
dear
cousin
,
I
was
recalled
to
the
garrison
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
where
is
that
,
if
you
please
?
and
why
did
not
you
come
to
say
*NL*
farewell
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
Queue-en-Brie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Phoebus
was
delighted
with
the
first
question
,
which
helped
him
to
avoid
*NL*
the
second
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
that
is
quite
close
by
,
monsieur
.
Why
did
you
not
come
to
see
me
a
*NL*
single
time
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Phoebus
was
rather
seriously
embarrassed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
--
the
service
--
and
then
,
charming
cousin
,
I
have
been
ill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ill
!
''
she
repeated
in
alarm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
wounded
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wounded
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
poor
child
was
completely
upset
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
do
not
be
frightened
at
that
,
''
said
Phoebus
,
carelessly
,
``
it
was
*NL*
nothing
.
A
quarrel
,
a
sword
cut
;
what
is
that
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
that
to
me
?
''
exclaimed
Fleur-de-Lys
,
raising
her
beautiful
eyes
*NL*
filled
with
tears
.
``
Oh
!
you
do
not
say
what
you
think
when
you
speak
*NL*
thus
.
What
sword
cut
was
that
?
I
wish
to
know
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
dear
fair
one
,
I
had
a
falling
out
with
Mahe
Fedy
,
you
know
?
*NL*
the
lieutenant
of
Saint-Germain-en-Laye
,
and
we
ripped
open
a
few
inches
*NL*
of
skin
for
each
other
.
That
is
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
mendacious
captain
was
perfectly
well
aware
that
an
affair
of
*NL*
honor
always
makes
a
man
stand
well
in
the
eyes
of
a
woman
.
In
fact
,
*NL*
Fleur-de-Lys
looked
him
full
in
the
face
,
all
agitated
with
fear
,
*NL*
pleasure
,
and
admiration
.
Still
,
she
was
not
completely
reassured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Provided
that
you
are
wholly
cured
,
my
Phoebus

said
she
.
``
I
do
not
*NL*
know
your
Mahe
Fedy
,
but
he
is
a
villanous
man
.
And
whence
arose
this
*NL*
quarrel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Phoebus
,
whose
imagination
was
endowed
with
but
mediocre
power
*NL*
of
creation
,
began
to
find
himself
in
a
quandary
as
to
a
means
of
*NL*
extricating
himself
for
his
prowess
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
how
do
I
know
?
--
a
mere
nothing
,
a
horse
,
a
remark
!
Fair
cousin

''
*NL*
he
exclaimed
,
for
the
sake
of
changing
the
conversation
,
``
what
noise
is
*NL*
this
in
the
Cathedral
Square
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
approached
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
_
Mon
Dieu

,
fair
cousin

how
many
people
there
are
on
the
Place
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
not
,
''
said
Fleur-de-Lys
;
``
it
appears
that
a
witch
is
to
do
*NL*
penance
this
morning
before
the
church
,
and
thereafter
to
be
hung
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
was
so
thoroughly
persuaded
that
la
Esmeralda
's
affair
was
*NL*
concluded
,
that
he
was
but
little
disturbed
by
Fleur-de-Lys
's
words
.
*NL*
Still
,
he
asked
her
one
or
two
questions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
name
of
this
witch
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not

''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
is
she
said
to
have
done
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
shrugged
her
white
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
_
mon
Dieu

Jesus

''
said
her
mother
;
``
there
are
so
many
witches
*NL*
nowadays
that
I
dare
say
they
burn
them
without
knowing
their
names
.
One
*NL*
might
as
well
seek
the
name
of
every
cloud
in
the
sky
.
After
all
,
one
*NL*
may
be
tranquil
.
The
good
God
keeps
his
register
.
''
Here
the
venerable
*NL*
dame
rose
and
came
to
the
window
.
``
Good
Lord
!
you
are
right
,
Phoebus
,
''
*NL*
said
she
.
``
The
rabble
is
indeed
great
.
There
are
people
on
all
the
*NL*
roofs
,
blessed
be
God
!
Do
you
know
,
Phoebus
,
this
reminds
me
of
my
best
*NL*
days
.
The
entrance
of
King
Charles
VII.
,
when
,
also
,
there
were
many
*NL*
people
.
I
no
longer
remember
in
what
year
that
was
.
When
I
speak
of
this
*NL*
to
you
,
it
produces
upon
you
the
effect
,
--
does
it
not
?
--
the
effect
of
*NL*
something
very
old
,
and
upon
me
of
something
very
young
.
Oh
!
the
*NL*
crowd
was
far
finer
than
at
the
present
day
.
They
even
stood
upon
the
*NL*
machicolations
of
the
Porte
Sainte-Antoine
.
The
king
had
the
queen
on
a
*NL*
pillion
,
and
after
their
highnesses
came
all
the
ladies
mounted
behind
*NL*
all
the
lords
.
I
remember
that
they
laughed
loudly
,
because
beside
*NL*
Amanyon
de
Garlande
,
who
was
very
short
of
stature
,
there
rode
the
*NL*
Sire
Matefelon
,
a
chevalier
of
gigantic
size
,
who
had
killed
heaps
of
*NL*
English
.
It
was
very
fine
.
A
procession
of
all
the
gentlemen
of
France
,
*NL*
with
their
oriflammes
waving
red
before
the
eye
.
There
were
some
with
*NL*
pennons
and
some
with
banners
.
How
can
I
tell
?
the
Sire
de
Calm
with
a
*NL*
pennon
;
Jean
de
Chateaumorant
with
a
banner
;
the
Sire
de
Courcy
with
a
*NL*
banner
,
and
a
more
ample
one
than
any
of
the
others
except
the
Duc
de
*NL*
Bourbon
.
Alas
!
't
is
a
sad
thing
to
think
that
all
that
has
existed
and
*NL*
exists
no
longer
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
lovers
were
not
listening
to
the
venerable
dowager
.
Phoebus
*NL*
had
returned
and
was
leaning
on
the
back
of
his
betrothed
's
chair
,
a
*NL*
charming
post
whence
his
libertine
glance
plunged
into
all
the
openings
*NL*
of
Fleur-de-Lys
's
gorget
.
This
gorget
gaped
so
conveniently
,
and
allowed
*NL*
him
to
see
so
many
exquisite
things
and
to
divine
so
many
more
,
that
*NL*
Phoebus
,
dazzled
by
this
skin
with
its
gleams
of
satin
,
said
to
himself
,
*NL*
``
How
can
any
one
love
anything
but
a
fair
skin
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Both
were
silent
.
The
young
girl
raised
sweet
,
enraptured
eyes
to
him
*NL*
from
time
to
time
,
and
their
hair
mingled
in
a
ray
of
spring
sunshine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Phoebus
,
''
said
Fleur-de-Lys
suddenly
,
in
a
low
voice
,
``
we
are
to
be
*NL*
married
three
months
hence
;
swear
to
me
that
you
have
never
loved
any
*NL*
other
woman
than
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
swear
it
,
fair
angel
!
''
replied
Phoebus
,
and
his
passionate
glances
*NL*
aided
the
sincere
tone
of
his
voice
in
convincing
Fleur-de-Lys
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
the
good
mother
,
charmed
to
see
the
betrothed
pair
on
terms
*NL*
of
such
perfect
understanding
,
had
just
quitted
the
apartment
to
attend
*NL*
to
some
domestic
matter
;
Phoebus
observed
it
,
and
this
so
emboldened
*NL*
the
adventurous
captain
that
very
strange
ideas
mounted
to
his
brain
.
*NL*
Fleur-de-Lys
loved
him
,
he
was
her
betrothed
;
she
was
alone
with
him
;
*NL*
his
former
taste
for
her
had
re-awakened
,
not
with
all
its
fresh-ness
*NL*
but
with
all
its
ardor
;
after
all
,
there
is
no
great
harm
in
tasting
*NL*
one
's
wheat
while
it
is
still
in
the
blade
;
I
do
not
know
whether
*NL*
these
ideas
passed
through
his
mind
,
but
one
thing
is
certain
,
that
*NL*
Fleur-de-Lys
was
suddenly
alarmed
by
the
expression
of
his
glance
.
She
*NL*
looked
round
and
saw
that
her
mother
was
no
longer
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
heavens
!
''
said
she
,
blushing
and
uneasy
,
``
how
very
warm
I
am
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
,
in
fact
,
''
replied
Phoebus
,
``
that
it
can
not
be
far
from
midday
.
*NL*
The
sun
is
troublesome
.
We
need
only
lower
the
curtains
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
''
exclaimed
the
poor
little
thing
,
``
on
the
contrary
,
I
need
*NL*
air
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
like
a
fawn
who
feels
the
breath
of
the
pack
of
hounds
,
she
rose
,
*NL*
ran
to
the
window
,
opened
it
,
and
rushed
upon
the
balcony
.
*NL*
*NL*
Phoebus
,
much
discomfited
,
followed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
Place
du
Parvis
Notre-Dame
,
upon
which
the
balcony
looked
,
as
the
*NL*
reader
knows
,
presented
at
that
moment
a
singular
and
sinister
spectacle
*NL*
which
caused
the
fright
of
the
timid
Fleur-de-Lys
to
change
its
nature
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
immense
crowd
,
which
overflowed
into
all
the
neighboring
streets
,
*NL*
encumbered
the
Place
,
properly
speaking
.
The
little
wall
,
breast
high
,
*NL*
which
surrounded
the
Place
,
would
not
have
sufficed
to
keep
it
free
*NL*
had
it
not
been
lined
with
a
thick
hedge
of
sergeants
and
hackbuteers
,
*NL*
culverines
in
hand
.
Thanks
to
this
thicket
of
pikes
and
arquebuses
,
the
*NL*
Parvis
was
empty
.
Its
entrance
was
guarded
by
a
force
of
halberdiers
*NL*
with
the
armorial
bearings
of
the
bishop
.
The
large
doors
of
the
church
*NL*
were
closed
,
and
formed
a
contrast
with
the
innumerable
windows
on
the
*NL*
Place
,
which
,
open
to
their
very
gables
,
allowed
a
view
of
thousands
of
*NL*
heads
heaped
up
almost
like
the
piles
of
bullets
in
a
park
of
artillery
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
surface
of
this
rabble
was
dingy
,
dirty
,
earthy
.
The
spectacle
*NL*
which
it
was
expecting
was
evidently
one
of
the
sort
which
possess
the
*NL*
privilege
of
bringing
out
and
calling
together
the
vilest
among
the
*NL*
populace
.
Nothing
is
so
hideous
as
the
noise
which
was
made
by
that
*NL*
swarm
of
yellow
caps
and
dirty
heads
.
In
that
throng
there
were
more
*NL*
laughs
than
cries
,
more
women
than
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
time
to
time
,
a
sharp
and
vibrating
voice
pierced
the
general
*NL*
clamor
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ohe
!
Mahiet
Baliffre
!
Is
she
to
be
hung
yonder
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fool
!
t
`
is
here
that
she
is
to
make
her
apology
in
her
shift
!
the
good
*NL*
God
is
going
to
cough
Latin
in
her
face
!
That
is
always
done
here
,
at
*NL*
midday
.
If
't
is
the
gallows
that
you
wish
,
go
to
the
Greve
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
go
there
,
afterwards
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
,
la
Boucanbry
?
Is
it
true
that
she
has
refused
a
confessor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
appears
so
,
La
Bechaigne
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
what
a
pagan
she
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
the
custom
,
monsieur
.
The
bailiff
of
the
courts
is
bound
to
*NL*
deliver
the
malefactor
ready
judged
for
execution
if
he
be
a
layman
,
to
*NL*
the
provost
of
Paris
;
if
a
clerk
,
to
the
official
of
the
bishopric
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
God
!
''
said
Fleur-de-Lys
,
``
the
poor
creature
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
thought
filled
with
sadness
the
glance
which
she
cast
upon
the
*NL*
populace
.
The
captain
,
much
more
occupied
with
her
than
with
that
pack
*NL*
of
the
rabble
,
was
amorously
rumpling
her
girdle
behind
.
She
turned
*NL*
round
,
entreating
and
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
let
me
alone
,
Phoebus
!
If
my
mother
were
to
return
,
she
would
*NL*
see
your
hand
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
,
midday
rang
slowly
out
from
the
clock
of
Notre-Dame
.
A
*NL*
murmur
of
satisfaction
broke
out
in
the
crowd
.
The
last
vibration
of
the
*NL*
twelfth
stroke
had
hardly
died
away
when
all
heads
surged
like
the
waves
*NL*
beneath
a
squall
,
and
an
immense
shout
went
up
from
the
pavement
,
the
*NL*
windows
,
and
the
roofs
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
she
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fleur-de-Lys
pressed
her
hands
to
her
eyes
,
that
she
might
not
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Charming
girl
,
''
said
Phoebus
,
``
do
you
wish
to
withdraw
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
replied
;
and
she
opened
through
curiosity
,
the
eyes
which
she
*NL*
had
closed
through
fear
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
tumbrel
drawn
by
a
stout
Norman
horse
,
and
all
surrounded
by
cavalry
*NL*
in
violet
livery
with
white
crosses
,
had
just
debouched
upon
the
Place
*NL*
through
the
Rue
Saint-Pierre-aux-Boeufs
.
The
sergeants
of
the
watch
were
*NL*
clearing
a
passage
for
it
through
the
crowd
,
by
stout
blows
from
their
*NL*
clubs
.
Beside
the
cart
rode
several
officers
of
justice
and
police
,
*NL*
recognizable
by
their
black
costume
and
their
awkwardness
in
the
saddle
.
*NL*
Master
Jacques
Charmolue
paraded
at
their
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
fatal
cart
sat
a
young
girl
with
her
arms
tied
behind
her
back
,
*NL*
and
with
no
priest
beside
her
.
She
was
in
her
shift
;
her
long
black
hair
*NL*
-LRB-
the
fashion
then
was
to
cut
it
off
only
at
the
foot
of
the
gallows
-RRB-
*NL*
fell
in
disorder
upon
her
half-bared
throat
and
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athwart
that
waving
hair
,
more
glossy
than
the
plumage
of
a
raven
,
a
*NL*
thick
,
rough
,
gray
rope
was
visible
,
twisted
and
knotted
,
chafing
her
*NL*
delicate
collar-bones
and
twining
round
the
charming
neck
of
the
poor
*NL*
girl
,
like
an
earthworm
round
a
flower
.
Beneath
that
rope
glittered
a
*NL*
tiny
amulet
ornamented
with
bits
of
green
glass
,
which
had
been
left
to
*NL*
her
no
doubt
,
because
nothing
is
refused
to
those
who
are
about
to
die
.
*NL*
The
spectators
in
the
windows
could
see
in
the
bottom
of
the
cart
her
*NL*
naked
legs
which
she
strove
to
hide
beneath
her
,
as
by
a
final
feminine
*NL*
instinct
.
At
her
feet
lay
a
little
goat
,
bound
.
The
condemned
girl
held
*NL*
together
with
her
teeth
her
imperfectly
fastened
shift
.
One
would
have
*NL*
said
that
she
suffered
still
more
in
her
misery
from
being
thus
exposed
*NL*
almost
naked
to
the
eyes
of
all
.
Alas
!
modesty
is
not
made
for
such
*NL*
shocks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jesus
!
''
said
Fleur-de-Lys
hastily
to
the
captain
.
``
Look
fair
cousin
,
*NL*
't
is
that
wretched
Bohemian
with
the
goat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
she
turned
to
Phoebus
.
His
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
tumbrel
.
He
*NL*
was
very
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
Bohemian
with
the
goat
?
''
he
stammered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
resumed
Fleur-de-Lys
,
``
do
you
not
remember
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Phoebus
interrupted
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
know
what
you
mean
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
a
step
to
re-enter
the
room
,
but
Fleur-de-Lys
,
whose
jealousy
,
*NL*
previously
so
vividly
aroused
by
this
same
gypsy
,
had
just
been
*NL*
re-awakened
,
Fleur-de-Lys
gave
him
a
look
full
of
penetration
and
*NL*
distrust
.
She
vaguely
recalled
at
that
moment
having
heard
of
a
captain
*NL*
mixed
up
in
the
trial
of
that
witch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
with
you
?
''
she
said
to
Phoebus
,
``
one
would
say
,
that
*NL*
this
woman
had
disturbed
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Phoebus
forced
a
sneer
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Me
!
Not
the
least
in
the
world
!
Ah
!
yes
,
certainly
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Remain
,
then
!
''
she
continued
imperiously
,
``
and
let
us
see
the
end
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
unlucky
captain
was
obliged
to
remain
.
He
was
somewhat
reassured
by
*NL*
the
fact
that
the
condemned
girl
never
removed
her
eyes
from
the
bottom
*NL*
of
the
cart
.
It
was
but
too
surely
la
Esmeralda
.
In
this
last
stage
of
*NL*
opprobrium
and
misfortune
,
she
was
still
beautiful
;
her
great
black
eyes
*NL*
appeared
still
larger
,
because
of
the
emaciation
of
her
cheeks
;
her
pale
*NL*
profile
was
pure
and
sublime
.
She
resembled
what
she
had
been
,
in
*NL*
the
same
degree
that
a
virgin
by
Masaccio
,
resembles
a
virgin
of
*NL*
Raphael
,
--
weaker
,
thinner
,
more
delicate
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
there
was
nothing
in
her
which
was
not
shaken
in
some
sort
,
*NL*
and
which
with
the
exception
of
her
modesty
,
she
did
not
let
go
at
*NL*
will
,
so
profoundly
had
she
been
broken
by
stupor
and
despair
.
Her
body
*NL*
bounded
at
every
jolt
of
the
tumbrel
like
a
dead
or
broken
thing
;
her
*NL*
gaze
was
dull
and
imbecile
.
A
tear
was
still
visible
in
her
eyes
,
but
*NL*
motionless
and
frozen
,
so
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
the
lugubrious
cavalcade
has
traversed
the
crowd
amid
cries
*NL*
of
joy
and
curious
attitudes
.
But
as
a
faithful
historian
,
we
must
state
*NL*
that
on
beholding
her
so
beautiful
,
so
depressed
,
many
were
moved
with
*NL*
pity
,
even
among
the
hardest
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tumbrel
had
entered
the
Parvis
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
halted
before
the
central
portal
.
The
escort
ranged
themselves
in
*NL*
line
on
both
sides
.
The
crowd
became
silent
,
and
,
in
the
midst
of
this
*NL*
silence
full
of
anxiety
and
solemnity
,
the
two
leaves
of
the
grand
door
*NL*
swung
back
,
as
of
themselves
,
on
their
hinges
,
which
gave
a
creak
like
*NL*
the
sound
of
a
fife
.
Then
there
became
visible
in
all
its
length
,
the
*NL*
deep
,
gloomy
church
,
hung
in
black
,
sparely
lighted
with
a
few
candles
*NL*
gleaming
afar
off
on
the
principal
altar
,
opened
in
the
midst
of
the
*NL*
Place
which
was
dazzling
with
light
,
like
the
mouth
of
a
cavern
.
At
the
*NL*
very
extremity
,
in
the
gloom
of
the
apse
,
a
gigantic
silver
cross
*NL*
was
visible
against
a
black
drapery
which
hung
from
the
vault
to
the
*NL*
pavement
.
The
whole
nave
was
deserted
.
But
a
few
heads
of
priests
could
*NL*
be
seen
moving
confusedly
in
the
distant
choir
stalls
,
and
,
at
the
*NL*
moment
when
the
great
door
opened
,
there
escaped
from
the
church
a
*NL*
loud
,
solemn
,
and
monotonous
chanting
,
which
cast
over
the
head
of
the
*NL*
condemned
girl
,
in
gusts
,
fragments
of
melancholy
psalms
,
--
*NL*
*NL*

''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
time
,
another
voice
,
separate
from
the
choir
,
intoned
upon
*NL*
the
steps
of
the
chief
altar
,
this
melancholy
offertory
,
--

but

*NL*

''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
This
chant
,
which
a
few
old
men
buried
in
the
gloom
sang
from
afar
over
*NL*
that
beautiful
creature
,
full
of
youth
and
life
,
caressed
by
the
warm
*NL*
air
of
spring
,
inundated
with
sunlight
was
the
mass
for
the
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
people
listened
devoutly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
unhappy
girl
seemed
to
lose
her
sight
and
her
consciousness
in
*NL*
the
obscure
interior
of
the
church
.
Her
white
lips
moved
as
though
in
*NL*
prayer
,
and
the
headsman
's
assistant
who
approached
to
assist
her
*NL*
to
alight
from
the
cart
,
heard
her
repeating
this
word
in
a
low
*NL*
tone
,
--
``
Phoebus
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
untied
her
hands
,
made
her
alight
,
accompanied
by
her
goat
,
which
*NL*
had
also
been
unbound
,
and
which
bleated
with
joy
at
finding
itself
*NL*
free
:
and
they
made
her
walk
barefoot
on
the
hard
pavement
to
the
foot
*NL*
of
the
steps
leading
to
the
door
.
The
rope
about
her
neck
trailed
behind
*NL*
her
.
One
would
have
said
it
was
a
serpent
following
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
chanting
in
the
church
ceased
.
A
great
golden
cross
and
a
row
*NL*
of
wax
candles
began
to
move
through
the
gloom
.
The
halberds
of
the
*NL*
motley
beadles
clanked
;
and
,
a
few
moments
later
,
a
long
procession
of
*NL*
priests
in
chasubles
,
and
deacons
in
dalmatics
,
marched
gravely
towards
*NL*
the
condemned
girl
,
as
they
drawled
their
song
,
spread
out
before
her
*NL*
view
and
that
of
the
crowd
.
But
her
glance
rested
on
the
one
who
marched
*NL*
at
the
head
,
immediately
after
the
cross-bearer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
she
said
in
a
low
voice
,
and
with
a
shudder
,
''
't
is
he
again
!
the
*NL*
priest
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
fact
,
the
archdeacon
.
On
his
left
he
had
the
sub-chanter
,
on
*NL*
his
right
,
the
chanter
,
armed
with
his
official
wand
.
He
advanced
with
*NL*
head
thrown
back
,
his
eyes
fixed
and
wide
open
,
intoning
in
a
strong
*NL*
voice
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
''

``
Out

I

For
thou

me
into
the
deep
in
the
midst
of
the
seas
,
*NL*
and
the
floods
compassed
me
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
moment
when
he
made
his
appearance
in
the
full
daylight
beneath
*NL*
the
lofty
arched
portal
,
enveloped
in
an
ample
cope
of
silver
barred
*NL*
with
a
black
cross
,
he
was
so
pale
that
more
than
one
person
in
the
*NL*
crowd
thought
that
one
of
the
marble
bishops
who
knelt
on
the
sepulchral
*NL*
stones
of
the
choir
had
risen
and
was
come
to
receive
upon
the
brink
of
*NL*
the
tomb
,
the
woman
who
was
about
to
die
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
,
no
less
pale
,
no
less
like
a
statue
,
had
hardly
noticed
that
they
*NL*
had
placed
in
her
hand
a
heavy
,
lighted
candle
of
yellow
wax
;
she
had
*NL*
not
heard
the
yelping
voice
of
the
clerk
reading
the
fatal
contents
*NL*
of
the
apology
;
when
they
told
her
to
respond
with
Amen
,
she
responded
*NL*
Amen
.
She
only
recovered
life
and
force
when
she
beheld
the
priest
make
*NL*
a
sign
to
her
guards
to
withdraw
,
and
himself
advance
alone
towards
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
felt
her
blood
boil
in
her
head
,
and
a
remnant
of
indignation
*NL*
flashed
up
in
that
soul
already
benumbed
and
cold
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
archdeacon
approached
her
slowly
;
even
in
that
extremity
,
she
beheld
*NL*
him
cast
an
eye
sparkling
with
sensuality
,
jealousy
,
and
desire
,
over
*NL*
her
exposed
form
.
Then
he
said
aloud
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Young
girl
,
have
you
asked
God
's
pardon
for
your
faults
and
*NL*
shortcomings
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
bent
down
to
her
ear
,
and
added
-LRB-
the
spectators
supposed
that
he
*NL*
was
receiving
her
last
confession
-RRB-
:
``
Will
you
have
me
?
I
can
still
save
*NL*
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
intently
at
him
:
``
Begone
,
demon
,
or
I
will
denounce
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
gave
vent
to
a
horrible
smile
:
``
You
will
not
be
believed
.
You
will
*NL*
only
add
a
scandal
to
a
crime
.
Reply
quickly
!
Will
you
have
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
you
done
with
my
Phoebus
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
dead
!
''
said
the
priest
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
the
wretched
archdeacon
raised
his
head
mechanically
and
*NL*
beheld
at
the
other
end
of
the
Place
,
in
the
balcony
of
the
Gondelaurier
*NL*
mansion
,
the
captain
standing
beside
Fleur-de-Lys
.
He
staggered
,
passed
*NL*
his
hand
across
his
eyes
,
looked
again
,
muttered
a
curse
,
and
all
his
*NL*
features
were
violently
contorted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
die
then
!
''
he
hissed
between
his
teeth
.
``
No
one
shall
have
*NL*
you
.
''
Then
,
raising
his
hand
over
the
gypsy
,
he
exclaimed
in
a
funereal
*NL*
voice
:
--
''
_
I
nunc
,
anima
anceps
,
et
sit
tibi
Deus
misenicors
_
!
''
*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
Go
now
,
soul
,
trembling
in
the
balance
,
and
God
have
mercy
*NL*
upon
thee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
dread
formula
with
which
it
was
the
custom
to
conclude
*NL*
these
gloomy
ceremonies
.
It
was
the
signal
agreed
upon
between
the
*NL*
priest
and
the
executioner
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
crowd
knelt
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Kyrie
eleison
_
,
''
*
said
the
priests
,
who
had
remained
beneath
the
arch
*NL*
of
the
portal
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
Lord
have
mercy
upon
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Kyrie
eleison
_
,
''
repeated
the
throng
in
that
murmur
which
runs
over
*NL*
all
heads
,
like
the
waves
of
a
troubled
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Amen
,
''
said
the
archdeacon
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
his
back
on
the
condemned
girl
,
his
head
sank
upon
his
breast
*NL*
once
more
,
he
crossed
his
hands
and
rejoined
his
escort
of
priests
,
and
*NL*
a
moment
later
he
was
seen
to
disappear
,
with
the
cross
,
the
candles
,
*NL*
and
the
copes
,
beneath
the
misty
arches
of
the
cathedral
,
and
his
*NL*
sonorous
voice
was
extinguished
by
degrees
in
the
choir
,
as
he
chanted
*NL*
this
verse
of
despair
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Omnes
gurgites
tui
et
fluctus
tui
super
me
transierunt
_
.
''
*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
All
thy
waves
and
thy
billows
have
gone
over
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
time
,
the
intermittent
clash
of
the
iron
butts
of
the
*NL*
beadles
'
halberds
,
gradually
dying
away
among
the
columns
of
the
nave
,
*NL*
produced
the
effect
of
a
clock
hammer
striking
the
last
hour
of
the
*NL*
condemned
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doors
of
Notre-Dame
remained
open
,
allowing
a
view
of
the
empty
*NL*
desolate
church
,
draped
in
mourning
,
without
candles
,
and
without
*NL*
voices
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
condemned
girl
remained
motionless
in
her
place
,
waiting
to
be
*NL*
disposed
of
.
One
of
the
sergeants
of
police
was
obliged
to
notify
Master
*NL*
Charmolue
of
the
fact
,
as
the
latter
,
during
this
entire
scene
,
had
been
*NL*
engaged
in
studying
the
bas-relief
of
the
grand
portal
which
represents
,
*NL*
according
to
some
,
the
sacrifice
of
Abraham
;
according
to
others
,
the
*NL*
philosopher
's
alchemical
operation
:
the
sun
being
figured
forth
by
the
*NL*
angel
;
the
fire
,
by
the
fagot
;
the
artisan
,
by
Abraham
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
considerable
difficulty
in
drawing
him
away
from
that
*NL*
contemplation
,
but
at
length
he
turned
round
;
and
,
at
a
signal
which
he
*NL*
gave
,
two
men
clad
in
yellow
,
the
executioner
's
assistants
,
approached
*NL*
the
gypsy
to
bind
her
hands
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
unhappy
creature
,
at
the
moment
of
mounting
once
again
the
fatal
*NL*
cart
,
and
proceeding
to
her
last
halting-place
,
was
seized
,
possibly
,
*NL*
with
some
poignant
clinging
to
life
.
She
raised
her
dry
,
red
eyes
to
*NL*
heaven
,
to
the
sun
,
to
the
silvery
clouds
,
cut
here
and
there
by
a
blue
*NL*
trapezium
or
triangle
;
then
she
lowered
them
to
objects
around
her
,
to
*NL*
the
earth
,
the
throng
,
the
houses
;
all
at
once
,
while
the
yellow
man
was
*NL*
binding
her
elbows
,
she
uttered
a
terrible
cry
,
a
cry
of
joy
.
Yonder
,
on
*NL*
that
balcony
,
at
the
corner
of
the
Place
,
she
had
just
caught
sight
of
*NL*
him
,
of
her
friend
,
her
lord
,
Phoebus
,
the
other
apparition
of
her
life
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
judge
had
lied
!
the
priest
had
lied
!
it
was
certainly
he
,
she
could
*NL*
not
doubt
it
;
he
was
there
,
handsome
,
alive
,
dressed
in
his
brilliant
*NL*
uniform
,
his
plume
on
his
head
,
his
sword
by
his
side
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Phoebus
!
''
she
cried
,
``
my
Phoebus
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
tried
to
stretch
towards
him
arms
trembling
with
love
and
*NL*
rapture
,
but
they
were
bound
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
saw
the
captain
frown
,
a
beautiful
young
girl
who
was
leaning
*NL*
against
him
gazed
at
him
with
disdainful
lips
and
irritated
eyes
;
then
*NL*
Phoebus
uttered
some
words
which
did
not
reach
her
,
and
both
disappeared
*NL*
precipitately
behind
the
window
opening
upon
the
balcony
,
which
closed
*NL*
after
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Phoebus
!
''
she
cried
wildly
,
``
can
it
be
you
believe
it
?
''
A
monstrous
*NL*
thought
had
just
presented
itself
to
her
.
She
remembered
that
she
had
*NL*
been
condemned
to
death
for
murder
committed
on
the
person
of
Phoebus
de
*NL*
Chateaupers
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
borne
up
until
that
moment
.
But
this
last
blow
was
too
harsh
.
*NL*
She
fell
lifeless
on
the
pavement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
''
said
Charmolue
,
``
carry
her
to
the
cart
,
and
make
an
end
of

No
one
had
yet
observed
in
the
gallery
of
the
statues
of
the
kings
,
*NL*
carved
directly
above
the
arches
of
the
portal
,
a
strange
spectator
,
who
*NL*
had
,
up
to
that
time
,
observed
everything
with
such
impassiveness
,
with
*NL*
a
neck
so
strained
,
a
visage
so
hideous
that
,
in
his
motley
accoutrement
*NL*
of
red
and
violet
,
he
might
have
been
taken
for
one
of
those
stone
*NL*
monsters
through
whose
mouths
the
long
gutters
of
the
cathedral
have
*NL*
discharged
their
waters
for
six
hundred
years
.
This
spectator
had
missed
*NL*
nothing
that
had
taken
place
since
midday
in
front
of
the
portal
of
*NL*
Notre-Dame
.
And
at
the
very
beginning
he
had
securely
fastened
to
one
of
*NL*
the
small
columns
a
large
knotted
rope
,
one
end
of
which
trailed
on
the
*NL*
flight
of
steps
below
.
This
being
done
,
he
began
to
look
on
tranquilly
,
*NL*
whistling
from
time
to
time
when
a
blackbird
flitted
past
.
Suddenly
,
*NL*
at
the
moment
when
the
superintendent
's
assistants
were
preparing
*NL*
to
execute
Charmolue
's
phlegmatic
order
,
he
threw
his
leg
over
the
*NL*
balustrade
of
the
gallery
,
seized
the
rope
with
his
feet
,
his
knees
and
*NL*
his
hands
;
then
he
was
seen
to
glide
down
the
facade
,
as
a
drop
of
*NL*
rain
slips
down
a
window-pane
,
rush
to
the
two
executioners
with
the
*NL*
swiftness
of
a
cat
which
has
fallen
from
a
roof
,
knock
them
down
with
*NL*
two
enormous
fists
,
pick
up
the
gypsy
with
one
hand
,
as
a
child
would
*NL*
her
doll
,
and
dash
back
into
the
church
with
a
single
bound
,
lifting
the
*NL*
young
girl
above
his
head
and
crying
in
a
formidable
voice
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sanctuary
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
done
with
such
rapidity
,
that
had
it
taken
place
at
night
,
*NL*
the
whole
of
it
could
have
been
seen
in
the
space
of
a
single
flash
of
*NL*
lightning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sanctuary
!
Sanctuary
!
''
repeated
the
crowd
;
and
the
clapping
of
ten
*NL*
thousand
hands
made
Quasimodo
's
single
eye
sparkle
with
joy
and
pride
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
shock
restored
the
condemned
girl
to
her
senses
.
She
raised
her
*NL*
eyelids
,
looked
at
Quasimodo
,
then
closed
them
again
suddenly
,
as
though
*NL*
terrified
by
her
deliverer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charmolue
was
stupefied
,
as
well
as
the
executioners
and
the
entire
*NL*
escort
.
In
fact
,
within
the
bounds
of
Notre-Dame
,
the
condemned
girl
*NL*
could
not
be
touched
.
The
cathedral
was
a
place
of
refuge
.
All
temporal
*NL*
jurisdiction
expired
upon
its
threshold
.
*NL*
*NL*
Quasimodo
had
halted
beneath
the
great
portal
,
his
huge
feet
seemed
*NL*
as
solid
on
the
pavement
of
the
church
as
the
heavy
Roman
pillars
.
*NL*
His
great
,
bushy
head
sat
low
between
his
shoulders
,
like
the
heads
of
*NL*
lions
,
who
also
have
a
mane
and
no
neck
.
He
held
the
young
girl
,
who
was
*NL*
quivering
all
over
,
suspended
from
his
horny
hands
like
a
white
drapery
;
*NL*
but
he
carried
her
with
as
much
care
as
though
he
feared
to
break
her
*NL*
or
blight
her
.
One
would
have
said
that
he
felt
that
she
was
a
delicate
,
*NL*
exquisite
,
precious
thing
,
made
for
other
hands
than
his
.
There
were
*NL*
moments
when
he
looked
as
if
not
daring
to
touch
her
,
even
with
his
*NL*
breath
.
Then
,
all
at
once
,
he
would
press
her
forcibly
in
his
arms
,
*NL*
against
his
angular
bosom
,
like
his
own
possession
,
his
treasure
,
as
*NL*
the
mother
of
that
child
would
have
done
.
His
gnome
's
eye
,
fastened
upon
*NL*
her
,
inundated
her
with
tenderness
,
sadness
,
and
pity
,
and
was
suddenly
*NL*
raised
filled
with
lightnings
.
Then
the
women
laughed
and
wept
,
the
*NL*
crowd
stamped
with
enthusiasm
,
for
,
at
that
moment
Quasimodo
had
a
*NL*
beauty
of
his
own
.
He
was
handsome
;
he
,
that
orphan
,
that
foundling
,
*NL*
that
outcast
,
he
felt
himself
august
and
strong
,
he
gazed
in
the
face
*NL*
of
that
society
from
which
he
was
banished
,
and
in
which
he
had
so
*NL*
powerfully
intervened
,
of
that
human
justice
from
which
he
had
wrenched
*NL*
its
prey
,
of
all
those
tigers
whose
jaws
were
forced
to
remain
empty
,
of
*NL*
those
policemen
,
those
judges
,
those
executioners
,
of
all
that
force
of
*NL*
the
king
which
he
,
the
meanest
of
creatures
,
had
just
broken
,
with
the
*NL*
force
of
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
,
it
was
touching
to
behold
this
protection
which
had
fallen
*NL*
from
a
being
so
hideous
upon
a
being
so
unhappy
,
a
creature
condemned
to
*NL*
death
saved
by
Quasimodo
.
They
were
two
extremes
of
natural
and
social
*NL*
wretchedness
,
coming
into
contact
and
aiding
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
after
several
moments
of
triumph
,
Quasimodo
had
plunged
*NL*
abruptly
into
the
church
with
his
burden
.
The
populace
,
fond
of
all
*NL*
prowess
,
sought
him
with
their
eyes
,
beneath
the
gloomy
nave
,
regretting
*NL*
that
he
had
so
speedily
disappeared
from
their
acclamations
.
All
at
*NL*
once
,
he
was
seen
to
re-appear
at
one
of
the
extremities
of
the
gallery
*NL*
of
the
kings
of
France
;
he
traversed
it
,
running
like
a
madman
,
raising
*NL*
his
conquest
high
in
his
arms
and
shouting
:
``
Sanctuary
!
''
The
crowd
broke
*NL*
forth
into
fresh
applause
.
The
gallery
passed
,
he
plunged
once
more
*NL*
into
the
interior
of
the
church
.
A
moment
later
,
he
re-appeared
upon
the
*NL*
upper
platform
,
with
the
gypsy
still
in
his
arms
,
still
running
madly
,
*NL*
still
crying
,
``
Sanctuary
!
''
and
the
throng
applauded
.
Finally
,
he
made
*NL*
his
appearance
for
the
third
time
upon
the
summit
of
the
tower
where
*NL*
hung
the
great
bell
;
from
that
point
he
seemed
to
be
showing
to
the
*NL*
entire
city
the
girl
whom
he
had
saved
,
and
his
voice
of
thunder
,
that
*NL*
voice
which
was
so
rarely
heard
,
and
which
he
never
heard
himself
,
*NL*
repeated
thrice
with
frenzy
,
even
to
the
clouds
:
``
Sanctuary
!
Sanctuary
!
*NL*
Sanctuary
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Noel
!
Noel
!
''
shouted
the
populace
in
its
turn
;
and
that
immense
*NL*
acclamation
flew
to
astonish
the
crowd
assembled
at
the
Greve
on
the
*NL*
other
bank
,
and
the
recluse
who
was
still
waiting
with
her
eyes
riveted
*NL*
on
the
gibbet
.

CHAPTER
I.
DELIRIUM
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Claude
Frollo
was
no
longer
in
Notre-Dame
when
his
adopted
son
so
*NL*
abruptly
cut
the
fatal
web
in
which
the
archdeacon
and
the
gypsy
were
*NL*
entangled
.
On
returning
to
the
sacristy
he
had
torn
off
his
alb
,
cope
,
*NL*
and
stole
,
had
flung
all
into
the
hands
of
the
stupefied
beadle
,
had
*NL*
made
his
escape
through
the
private
door
of
the
cloister
,
had
ordered
a
*NL*
boatman
of
the
Terrain
to
transport
him
to
the
left
bank
of
the
Seine
,
*NL*
and
had
plunged
into
the
hilly
streets
of
the
University
,
not
knowing
*NL*
whither
he
was
going
,
encountering
at
every
step
groups
of
men
and
women
*NL*
who
were
hurrying
joyously
towards
the
Pont
Saint-Michel
,
in
the
hope
*NL*
of
still
arriving
in
time
to
see
the
witch
hung
there
,
--
pale
,
wild
,
more
*NL*
troubled
,
more
blind
and
more
fierce
than
a
night
bird
let
loose
and
*NL*
pursued
by
a
troop
of
children
in
broad
daylight
.
He
no
longer
knew
*NL*
where
he
was
,
what
he
thought
,
or
whether
he
were
dreaming
.
He
went
*NL*
forward
,
walking
,
running
,
taking
any
street
at
haphazard
,
making
no
*NL*
choice
,
only
urged
ever
onward
away
from
the
Greve
,
the
horrible
Greve
,
*NL*
which
he
felt
confusedly
,
to
be
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
manner
he
skirted
Mount
Sainte-Genevieve
,
and
finally
emerged
*NL*
from
the
town
by
the
Porte
Saint-Victor
.
He
continued
his
flight
as
long
*NL*
as
he
could
see
,
when
he
turned
round
,
the
turreted
enclosure
of
the
*NL*
University
,
and
the
rare
houses
of
the
suburb
;
but
,
when
,
at
length
,
a
*NL*
rise
of
ground
had
completely
concealed
from
him
that
odious
Paris
,
when
*NL*
he
could
believe
himself
to
be
a
hundred
leagues
distant
from
it
,
in
the
*NL*
fields
,
in
the
desert
,
he
halted
,
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
breathed
*NL*
more
freely
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
frightful
ideas
thronged
his
mind
.
Once
more
he
could
see
clearly
*NL*
into
his
soul
,
and
he
shuddered
.
He
thought
of
that
unhappy
girl
who
had
*NL*
destroyed
him
,
and
whom
he
had
destroyed
.
He
cast
a
haggard
eye
over
the
*NL*
double
,
tortuous
way
which
fate
had
caused
their
two
destinies
to
pursue
*NL*
up
to
their
point
of
intersection
,
where
it
had
dashed
them
against
each
*NL*
other
without
mercy
.
He
meditated
on
the
folly
of
eternal
vows
,
on
*NL*
the
vanity
of
chastity
,
of
science
,
of
religion
,
of
virtue
,
on
the
*NL*
uselessness
of
God
.
He
plunged
to
his
heart
's
content
in
evil
thoughts
,
*NL*
and
in
proportion
as
he
sank
deeper
,
he
felt
a
Satanic
laugh
burst
forth
*NL*
within
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
as
he
thus
sifted
his
soul
to
the
bottom
,
when
he
perceived
how
*NL*
large
a
space
nature
had
prepared
there
for
the
passions
,
he
sneered
*NL*
still
more
bitterly
.
He
stirred
up
in
the
depths
of
his
heart
all
his
*NL*
hatred
,
all
his
malevolence
;
and
,
with
the
cold
glance
of
a
physician
*NL*
who
examines
a
patient
,
he
recognized
the
fact
that
this
malevolence
*NL*
was
nothing
but
vitiated
love
;
that
love
,
that
source
of
every
virtue
in
*NL*
man
,
turned
to
horrible
things
in
the
heart
of
a
priest
,
and
that
a
man
*NL*
constituted
like
himself
,
in
making
himself
a
priest
,
made
himself
a
*NL*
demon
.
Then
he
laughed
frightfully
,
and
suddenly
became
pale
again
,
*NL*
when
he
considered
the
most
sinister
side
of
his
fatal
passion
,
of
that
*NL*
corrosive
,
venomous
malignant
,
implacable
love
,
which
had
ended
only
in
*NL*
the
gibbet
for
one
of
them
and
in
hell
for
the
other
;
condemnation
for
*NL*
her
,
damnation
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
his
laughter
came
again
,
when
he
reflected
that
Phoebus
*NL*
was
alive
;
that
after
all
,
the
captain
lived
,
was
gay
and
happy
,
had
*NL*
handsomer
doublets
than
ever
,
and
a
new
mistress
whom
he
was
conducting
*NL*
to
see
the
old
one
hanged
.
His
sneer
redoubled
its
bitterness
when
he
*NL*
reflected
that
out
of
the
living
beings
whose
death
he
had
desired
,
the
*NL*
gypsy
,
the
only
creature
whom
he
did
not
hate
,
was
the
only
one
who
had
*NL*
not
escaped
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
from
the
captain
,
his
thought
passed
to
the
people
,
and
there
came
*NL*
to
him
a
jealousy
of
an
unprecedented
sort
.
He
reflected
that
the
people
*NL*
also
,
the
entire
populace
,
had
had
before
their
eyes
the
woman
whom
he
*NL*
loved
exposed
almost
naked
.
He
writhed
his
arms
with
agony
as
he
thought
*NL*
that
the
woman
whose
form
,
caught
by
him
alone
in
the
darkness
would
*NL*
have
been
supreme
happiness
,
had
been
delivered
up
in
broad
daylight
at
*NL*
full
noonday
,
to
a
whole
people
,
clad
as
for
a
night
of
voluptuousness
.
*NL*
He
wept
with
rage
over
all
these
mysteries
of
love
,
profaned
,
soiled
,
*NL*
laid
bare
,
withered
forever
.
He
wept
with
rage
as
he
pictured
to
himself
*NL*
how
many
impure
looks
had
been
gratified
at
the
sight
of
that
badly
*NL*
fastened
shift
,
and
that
this
beautiful
girl
,
this
virgin
lily
,
this
cup
*NL*
of
modesty
and
delight
,
to
which
he
would
have
dared
to
place
his
lips
*NL*
only
trembling
,
had
just
been
transformed
into
a
sort
of
public
bowl
,
*NL*
whereat
the
vilest
populace
of
Paris
,
thieves
,
beggars
,
lackeys
,
had
*NL*
come
to
quaff
in
common
an
audacious
,
impure
,
and
depraved
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
when
he
sought
to
picture
to
himself
the
happiness
which
he
might
*NL*
have
found
upon
earth
,
if
she
had
not
been
a
gypsy
,
and
if
he
had
not
*NL*
been
a
priest
,
if
Phoebus
had
not
existed
and
if
she
had
loved
him
;
when
*NL*
he
pictured
to
himself
that
a
life
of
serenity
and
love
would
have
been
*NL*
possible
to
him
also
,
even
to
him
;
that
there
were
at
that
very
moment
,
*NL*
here
and
there
upon
the
earth
,
happy
couples
spending
the
hours
in
sweet
*NL*
converse
beneath
orange
trees
,
on
the
banks
of
brooks
,
in
the
presence
*NL*
of
a
setting
sun
,
of
a
starry
night
;
and
that
if
God
had
so
willed
,
*NL*
he
might
have
formed
with
her
one
of
those
blessed
couples
,
--
his
heart
*NL*
melted
in
tenderness
and
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
!
she
!
still
she
!
It
was
this
fixed
idea
which
returned
incessantly
,
*NL*
which
tortured
him
,
which
ate
into
his
brain
,
and
rent
his
vitals
.
He
*NL*
did
not
regret
,
he
did
not
repent
;
all
that
he
had
done
he
was
ready
*NL*
to
do
again
;
he
preferred
to
behold
her
in
the
hands
of
the
executioner
*NL*
rather
than
in
the
arms
of
the
captain
.
But
he
suffered
;
he
suffered
*NL*
so
that
at
intervals
he
tore
out
handfuls
of
his
hair
to
see
whether
it
*NL*
were
not
turning
white
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
other
moments
there
came
one
,
when
it
occurred
to
him
that
it
was
*NL*
perhaps
the
very
minute
when
the
hideous
chain
which
he
had
seen
*NL*
that
morning
,
was
pressing
its
iron
noose
closer
about
that
frail
and
*NL*
graceful
neck
.
This
thought
caused
the
perspiration
to
start
from
every
*NL*
pore
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
another
moment
when
,
while
laughing
diabolically
at
himself
,
*NL*
he
represented
to
himself
la
Esmeralda
as
he
had
seen
her
on
that
*NL*
first
day
,
lively
,
careless
,
joyous
,
gayly
attired
,
dancing
,
winged
,
*NL*
harmonious
,
and
la
Esmeralda
of
the
last
day
,
in
her
scanty
shift
,
with
*NL*
a
rope
about
her
neck
,
mounting
slowly
with
her
bare
feet
,
the
angular
*NL*
ladder
of
the
gallows
;
he
figured
to
himself
this
double
picture
in
such
*NL*
a
manner
that
he
gave
vent
to
a
terrible
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
this
hurricane
of
despair
overturned
,
broke
,
tore
up
,
bent
,
*NL*
uprooted
everything
in
his
soul
,
he
gazed
at
nature
around
him
.
At
his
*NL*
feet
,
some
chickens
were
searching
the
thickets
and
pecking
,
enamelled
*NL*
beetles
ran
about
in
the
sun
;
overhead
,
some
groups
of
dappled
gray
*NL*
clouds
were
floating
across
the
blue
sky
;
on
the
horizon
,
the
spire
*NL*
of
the
Abbey
Saint-Victor
pierced
the
ridge
of
the
hill
with
its
slate
*NL*
obelisk
;
and
the
miller
of
the
Copeaue
hillock
was
whistling
as
he
*NL*
watched
the
laborious
wings
of
his
mill
turning
.
All
this
active
,
*NL*
organized
,
tranquil
life
,
recurring
around
him
under
a
thousand
forms
,
*NL*
hurt
him
.
He
resumed
his
flight
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sped
thus
across
the
fields
until
evening
.
This
flight
from
nature
,
*NL*
life
,
himself
,
man
,
God
,
everything
,
lasted
all
day
long
.
Sometimes
he
*NL*
flung
himself
face
downward
on
the
earth
,
and
tore
up
the
young
blades
*NL*
of
wheat
with
his
nails
.
Sometimes
he
halted
in
the
deserted
street
of
*NL*
a
village
,
and
his
thoughts
were
so
intolerable
that
he
grasped
his
head
*NL*
in
both
hands
and
tried
to
tear
it
from
his
shoulders
in
order
to
dash
*NL*
it
upon
the
pavement
.
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
the
hour
of
sunset
,
he
examined
himself
again
,
and
found
himself
*NL*
nearly
mad
.
The
tempest
which
had
raged
within
him
ever
since
the
*NL*
instant
when
he
had
lost
the
hope
and
the
will
to
save
the
gypsy
,
--
that
*NL*
tempest
had
not
left
in
his
conscience
a
single
healthy
idea
,
a
single
*NL*
thought
which
maintained
its
upright
position
.
His
reason
lay
there
*NL*
almost
entirely
destroyed
.
There
remained
but
two
distinct
images
in
his
*NL*
mind
,
la
Esmeralda
and
the
gallows
;
all
the
rest
was
blank
.
Those
two
*NL*
images
united
,
presented
to
him
a
frightful
group
;
and
the
more
he
*NL*
concentrated
what
attention
and
thought
was
left
to
him
,
the
more
he
*NL*
beheld
them
grow
,
in
accordance
with
a
fantastic
progression
,
the
one
in
*NL*
grace
,
in
charm
,
in
beauty
,
in
light
,
the
other
in
deformity
and
horror
;
*NL*
so
that
at
last
la
Esmeralda
appeared
to
him
like
a
star
,
the
gibbet
*NL*
like
an
enormous
,
fleshless
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
remarkable
fact
is
,
that
during
the
whole
of
this
torture
,
the
idea
*NL*
of
dying
did
not
seriously
occur
to
him
.
The
wretch
was
made
so
.
He
*NL*
clung
to
life
.
Perhaps
he
really
saw
hell
beyond
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
the
day
continued
to
decline
.
The
living
being
which
still
*NL*
existed
in
him
reflected
vaguely
on
retracing
its
steps
.
He
believed
*NL*
himself
to
be
far
away
from
Paris
;
on
taking
his
bearings
,
he
perceived
*NL*
that
he
had
only
circled
the
enclosure
of
the
University
.
The
spire
of
*NL*
Saint-Sulpice
,
and
the
three
lofty
needles
of
Saint
Germain-des-Pres
,
*NL*
rose
above
the
horizon
on
his
right
.
He
turned
his
steps
in
that
*NL*
direction
.
When
he
heard
the
brisk
challenge
of
the
men-at-arms
of
the
*NL*
abbey
,
around
the
crenelated
,
circumscribing
wall
of
Saint-Germain
,
he
*NL*
turned
aside
,
took
a
path
which
presented
itself
between
the
abbey
and
*NL*
the
lazar-house
of
the
bourg
,
and
at
the
expiration
of
a
few
minutes
*NL*
found
himself
on
the
verge
of
the
Pre-aux-Clercs
.
This
meadow
was
*NL*
celebrated
by
reason
of
the
brawls
which
went
on
there
night
and
day
;
*NL*
it
was
the
hydra
of
the
poor
monks
of
Saint-Germain
:
_
quod
mouachis
*NL*
Sancti-Germaini
pratensis
hydra
fuit
,
clericis
nova
semper
dissidiorum
*NL*
capita
suscitantibus
_
.
The
archdeacon
was
afraid
of
meeting
some
one
*NL*
there
;
he
feared
every
human
countenance
;
he
had
just
avoided
the
*NL*
University
and
the
Bourg
Saint-Germain
;
he
wished
to
re-enter
the
*NL*
streets
as
late
as
possible
.
He
skirted
the
Pre-aux-Clercs
,
took
the
*NL*
deserted
path
which
separated
it
from
the
Dieu-Neuf
,
and
at
last
reached
*NL*
the
water
's
edge
.
There
Dom
Claude
found
a
boatman
,
who
,
for
a
few
*NL*
farthings
in
Parisian
coinage
,
rowed
him
up
the
Seine
as
far
as
the
*NL*
point
of
the
city
,
and
landed
him
on
that
tongue
of
abandoned
land
*NL*
where
the
reader
has
already
beheld
Gringoire
dreaming
,
and
which
*NL*
was
prolonged
beyond
the
king
's
gardens
,
parallel
to
the
Ile
du
*NL*
Passeur-aux-Vaches
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
monotonous
rocking
of
the
boat
and
the
ripple
of
the
water
had
,
in
*NL*
some
sort
,
quieted
the
unhappy
Claude
.
When
the
boatman
had
taken
his
*NL*
departure
,
he
remained
standing
stupidly
on
the
strand
,
staring
straight
*NL*
before
him
and
perceiving
objects
only
through
magnifying
oscillations
*NL*
which
rendered
everything
a
sort
of
phantasmagoria
to
him
.
The
fatigue
*NL*
of
a
great
grief
not
infrequently
produces
this
effect
on
the
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
had
set
behind
the
lofty
Tour-de-Nesle
.
It
was
the
twilight
*NL*
hour
.
The
sky
was
white
,
the
water
of
the
river
was
white
.
Between
these
*NL*
two
white
expanses
,
the
left
bank
of
the
Seine
,
on
which
his
eyes
were
*NL*
fixed
,
projected
its
gloomy
mass
and
,
rendered
ever
thinner
and
thinner
*NL*
by
perspective
,
it
plunged
into
the
gloom
of
the
horizon
like
a
black
*NL*
spire
.
It
was
loaded
with
houses
,
of
which
only
the
obscure
outline
*NL*
could
be
distinguished
,
sharply
brought
out
in
shadows
against
the
light
*NL*
background
of
the
sky
and
the
water
.
Here
and
there
windows
began
to
*NL*
gleam
,
like
the
holes
in
a
brazier
.
That
immense
black
obelisk
thus
*NL*
isolated
between
the
two
white
expanses
of
the
sky
and
the
river
,
*NL*
which
was
very
broad
at
this
point
,
produced
upon
Dom
Claude
a
singular
*NL*
effect
,
comparable
to
that
which
would
be
experienced
by
a
man
who
,
*NL*
reclining
on
his
back
at
the
foot
of
the
tower
of
Strasburg
,
should
gaze
*NL*
at
the
enormous
spire
plunging
into
the
shadows
of
the
twilight
above
*NL*
his
head
.
Only
,
in
this
case
,
it
was
Claude
who
was
erect
and
the
*NL*
obelisk
which
was
lying
down
;
but
,
as
the
river
,
reflecting
the
sky
,
*NL*
prolonged
the
abyss
below
him
,
the
immense
promontory
seemed
to
be
as
*NL*
boldly
launched
into
space
as
any
cathedral
spire
;
and
the
impression
*NL*
was
the
same
.
This
impression
had
even
one
stronger
and
more
profound
*NL*
point
about
it
,
that
it
was
indeed
the
tower
of
Strasbourg
,
but
the
*NL*
tower
of
Strasbourg
two
leagues
in
height
;
something
unheard
of
,
*NL*
gigantic
,
immeasurable
;
an
edifice
such
as
no
human
eye
has
ever
seen
;
*NL*
a
tower
of
Babel
.
The
chimneys
of
the
houses
,
the
battlements
of
the
*NL*
walls
,
the
faceted
gables
of
the
roofs
,
the
spire
of
the
Augustines
,
*NL*
the
tower
of
Nesle
,
all
these
projections
which
broke
the
profile
of
*NL*
the
colossal
obelisk
added
to
the
illusion
by
displaying
in
eccentric
*NL*
fashion
to
the
eye
the
indentations
of
a
luxuriant
and
fantastic
*NL*
sculpture
.
*NL*
*NL*
Claude
,
in
the
state
of
hallucination
in
which
he
found
himself
,
*NL*
believed
that
he
saw
,
that
he
saw
with
his
actual
eyes
,
the
bell
tower
*NL*
of
hell
;
the
thousand
lights
scattered
over
the
whole
height
of
the
*NL*
terrible
tower
seemed
to
him
so
many
porches
of
the
immense
interior
*NL*
furnace
;
the
voices
and
noises
which
escaped
from
it
seemed
so
many
*NL*
shrieks
,
so
many
death
groans
.
Then
he
became
alarmed
,
he
put
his
hands
*NL*
on
his
ears
that
he
might
no
longer
hear
,
turned
his
back
that
he
might
*NL*
no
longer
see
,
and
fled
from
the
frightful
vision
with
hasty
strides
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
vision
was
in
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
re-entered
the
streets
,
the
passers-by
elbowing
each
other
by
*NL*
the
light
of
the
shop-fronts
,
produced
upon
him
the
effect
of
a
constant
*NL*
going
and
coming
of
spectres
about
him
.
There
were
strange
noises
in
his
*NL*
ears
;
extraordinary
fancies
disturbed
his
brain
.
He
saw
neither
*NL*
houses
,
nor
pavements
,
nor
chariots
,
nor
men
and
women
,
but
a
chaos
of
*NL*
indeterminate
objects
whose
edges
melted
into
each
other
.
At
the
corner
*NL*
of
the
Rue
de
la
Barillerie
,
there
was
a
grocer
's
shop
whose
porch
was
*NL*
garnished
all
about
,
according
to
immemorial
custom
,
with
hoops
of
tin
*NL*
from
which
hung
a
circle
of
wooden
candles
,
which
came
in
contact
with
*NL*
each
other
in
the
wind
,
and
rattled
like
castanets
.
He
thought
he
heard
*NL*
a
cluster
of
skeletons
at
Montfaucon
clashing
together
in
the
gloom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
he
muttered
,
``
the
night
breeze
dashes
them
against
each
other
,
*NL*
and
mingles
the
noise
of
their
chains
with
the
rattle
of
their
bones
!
*NL*
Perhaps
she
is
there
among
them
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
his
state
of
frenzy
,
he
knew
not
whither
he
was
going
.
After
a
few
*NL*
strides
he
found
himself
on
the
Pont
Saint-Michel
.
There
was
a
light
*NL*
in
the
window
of
a
ground-floor
room
;
he
approached
.
Through
a
cracked
*NL*
window
he
beheld
a
mean
chamber
which
recalled
some
confused
memory
*NL*
to
his
mind
.
In
that
room
,
badly
lighted
by
a
meagre
lamp
,
there
was
a
*NL*
fresh
,
light-haired
young
man
,
with
a
merry
face
,
who
amid
loud
bursts
*NL*
of
laughter
was
embracing
a
very
audaciously
attired
young
girl
;
and
*NL*
near
the
lamp
sat
an
old
crone
spinning
and
singing
in
a
quavering
*NL*
voice
.
As
the
young
man
did
not
laugh
constantly
,
fragments
of
the
old
*NL*
woman
's
ditty
reached
the
priest
;
it
was
something
unintelligible
yet
*NL*
frightful
,

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Thereupon
the
young
man
laughed
and
caressed
the
wench
.
The
crone
was
*NL*
la
Falourdel
;
the
girl
was
a
courtesan
;
the
young
man
was
his
brother
*NL*
Jehan
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
continued
to
gaze
.
That
spectacle
was
as
good
as
any
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
saw
Jehan
go
to
a
window
at
the
end
of
the
room
,
open
it
,
cast
a
*NL*
glance
on
the
quay
,
where
in
the
distance
blazed
a
thousand
lighted
*NL*
casements
,
and
he
heard
him
say
as
he
closed
the
sash
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Pon
my
soul
!
How
dark
it
is
;
the
people
are
lighting
their
candles
,
*NL*
and
the
good
God
his
stars
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Jehan
came
back
to
the
hag
,
smashed
a
bottle
standing
on
the
table
,
*NL*
exclaiming
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Already

_
cor-boeuf

and
I

Isabeau

where
I

''
*NL*
*NL*
This
fine
pleasantry
made
the
courtesan
laugh
,
and
Jehan
left
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dom
Claude
had
barely
time
to
fling
himself
on
the
ground
in
order
that
*NL*
he
might
not
be
met
,
stared
in
the
face
and
recognized
by
his
brother
.
*NL*
Luckily
,
the
street
was
dark
,
and
the
scholar
was
tipsy
.
Nevertheless
,
*NL*
he
caught
sight
of
the
archdeacon
prone
upon
the
earth
in
the
mud
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
oh
!
''
said
he
;
``
here
's
a
fellow

has
been
leading
a
jolly
life
,
*NL*

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stirred
up
Dom
Claude
with
his
foot
,
and
the
latter
held
his
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dead

resumed
Jehan
.
``

he
added

't
is
an
old
man
!
*NL*

Fortunate
senex

!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Dom
Claude
heard
him
retreat
,
saying
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
all
the
same
,
reason
is
a
fine
thing
,
and
my
brother
the
*NL*
archdeacon
is
very
happy
in
that
he
is
wise
and
has
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
archdeacon
rose
to
his
feet
,
and
ran
without
halting
,
towards
*NL*
Notre-Dame
,
whose
enormous
towers
he
beheld
rising
above
the
houses
*NL*
through
the
gloom
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
instant
when
he
arrived
,
panting
,
on
the
Place
du
Parvis
,
he
*NL*
shrank
back
and
dared
not
raise
his
eyes
to
the
fatal
edifice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
he
said
,
in
a
low
voice
,
``
is
it
really
true
that
such
a
thing
took
*NL*
place
here
,
to-day
,
this
very
morning
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Still
,
he
ventured
to
glance
at
the
church
.
The
front
was
sombre
;
the
*NL*
sky
behind
was
glittering
with
stars
.
The
crescent
of
the
moon
,
in
her
*NL*
flight
upward
from
the
horizon
,
had
paused
at
the
moment
,
on
the
summit
*NL*
of
the
light
hand
tower
,
and
seemed
to
have
perched
itself
,
like
a
*NL*
luminous
bird
,
on
the
edge
of
the
balustrade
,
cut
out
in
black
trefoils
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cloister
door
was
shut
;
but
the
archdeacon
always
carried
with
him
*NL*
the
key
of
the
tower
in
which
his
laboratory
was
situated
.
He
made
use
*NL*
of
it
to
enter
the
church
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
church
he
found
the
gloom
and
silence
of
a
cavern
.
By
the
deep
*NL*
shadows
which
fell
in
broad
sheets
from
all
directions
,
he
recognized
*NL*
the
fact
that
the
hangings
for
the
ceremony
of
the
morning
had
not
yet
*NL*
been
removed
.
The
great
silver
cross
shone
from
the
depths
of
the
*NL*
gloom
,
powdered
with
some
sparkling
points
,
like
the
milky
way
of
*NL*
that
sepulchral
night
.
The
long
windows
of
the
choir
showed
the
upper
*NL*
extremities
of
their
arches
above
the
black
draperies
,
and
their
painted
*NL*
panes
,
traversed
by
a
ray
of
moonlight
had
no
longer
any
hues
but
the
*NL*
doubtful
colors
of
night
,
a
sort
of
violet
,
white
and
blue
,
whose
tint
*NL*
is
found
only
on
the
faces
of
the
dead
.
The
archdeacon
,
on
perceiving
*NL*
these
wan
spots
all
around
the
choir
,
thought
he
beheld
the
mitres
of
*NL*
damned
bishops
.
He
shut
his
eyes
,
and
when
he
opened
them
again
,
he
*NL*
thought
they
were
a
circle
of
pale
visages
gazing
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
started
to
flee
across
the
church
.
Then
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
*NL*
church
also
was
shaking
,
moving
,
becoming
endued
with
animation
,
that
it
*NL*
was
alive
;
that
each
of
the
great
columns
was
turning
into
an
enormous
*NL*
paw
,
which
was
beating
the
earth
with
its
big
stone
spatula
,
and
that
*NL*
the
gigantic
cathedral
was
no
longer
anything
but
a
sort
of
prodigious
*NL*
elephant
,
which
was
breathing
and
marching
with
its
pillars
for
feet
,
*NL*
its
two
towers
for
trunks
and
the
immense
black
cloth
for
its
housings
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
fever
or
madness
had
reached
such
a
degree
of
intensity
that
the
*NL*
external
world
was
no
longer
anything
more
for
the
unhappy
man
than
a
*NL*
sort
of
Apocalypse
,
--
visible
,
palpable
,
terrible
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
one
moment
,
he
was
relieved
.
As
he
plunged
into
the
side
aisles
,
he
*NL*
perceived
a
reddish
light
behind
a
cluster
of
pillars
.
He
ran
towards
it
*NL*
as
to
a
star
.
It
was
the
poor
lamp
which
lighted
the
public
breviary
*NL*
of
Notre-Dame
night
and
day
,
beneath
its
iron
grating
.
He
flung
himself
*NL*
eagerly
upon
the
holy
book
in
the
hope
of
finding
some
consolation
,
or
*NL*
some
encouragement
there
.
The
hook
lay
open
at
this
passage
of
Job
,
over
*NL*
which
his
staring
eye
glanced
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
a
spirit
passed
before
my
face
,
and
I
heard
a
small
voice
,
and
the
*NL*
hair
of
my
flesh
stood
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
reading
these
gloomy
words
,
he
felt
that
which
a
blind
man
feels
when
*NL*
he
feels
himself
pricked
by
the
staff
which
he
has
picked
up
.
His
knees
*NL*
gave
way
beneath
him
,
and
he
sank
upon
the
pavement
,
thinking
of
her
who
*NL*
had
died
that
day
.
He
felt
so
many
monstrous
vapors
pass
and
discharge
*NL*
themselves
in
his
brain
,
that
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
head
had
become
*NL*
one
of
the
chimneys
of
hell
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
appear
that
he
remained
a
long
time
in
this
attitude
,
no
longer
*NL*
thinking
,
overwhelmed
and
passive
beneath
the
hand
of
the
demon
.
At
*NL*
length
some
strength
returned
to
him
;
it
occurred
to
him
to
take
refuge
*NL*
in
his
tower
beside
his
faithful
Quasimodo
.
He
rose
;
and
,
as
he
was
*NL*
afraid
,
he
took
the
lamp
from
the
breviary
to
light
his
way
.
It
was
a
*NL*
sacrilege
;
but
he
had
got
beyond
heeding
such
a
trifle
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
slowly
climbed
the
stairs
of
the
towers
,
filled
with
a
secret
fright
*NL*
which
must
have
been
communicated
to
the
rare
passers-by
in
the
Place
*NL*
du
Parvis
by
the
mysterious
light
of
his
lamp
,
mounting
so
late
from
*NL*
loophole
to
loophole
of
the
bell
tower
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
,
he
felt
a
freshness
on
his
face
,
and
found
himself
at
the
*NL*
door
of
the
highest
gallery
.
The
air
was
cold
;
the
sky
was
filled
with
*NL*
hurrying
clouds
,
whose
large
,
white
flakes
drifted
one
upon
another
like
*NL*
the
breaking
up
of
river
ice
after
the
winter
.
The
crescent
of
the
moon
,
*NL*
stranded
in
the
midst
of
the
clouds
,
seemed
a
celestial
vessel
caught
in
*NL*
the
ice-cakes
of
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
lowered
his
gaze
,
and
contemplated
for
a
moment
,
through
the
railing
*NL*
of
slender
columns
which
unites
the
two
towers
,
far
away
,
through
a
*NL*
gauze
of
mists
and
smoke
,
the
silent
throng
of
the
roofs
of
Paris
,
*NL*
pointed
,
innumerable
,
crowded
and
small
like
the
waves
of
a
tranquil
sea
*NL*
on
a
sum-mer
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
moon
cast
a
feeble
ray
,
which
imparted
to
earth
and
heaven
an
ashy
*NL*
hue
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
the
clock
raised
its
shrill
,
cracked
voice
.
Midnight
rang
*NL*
out
.
The
priest
thought
of
midday
;
twelve
o'clock
had
come
back
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
he
said
in
a
very
low
tone
,
``
she
must
be
cold
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
,
a
gust
of
wind
extinguished
his
lamp
,
and
almost
at
the
*NL*
same
instant
,
he
beheld
a
shade
,
a
whiteness
,
a
form
,
a
woman
,
appear
*NL*
from
the
opposite
angle
of
the
tower
.
He
started
.
Beside
this
woman
was
*NL*
a
little
goat
,
which
mingled
its
bleat
with
the
last
bleat
of
the
clock
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
strength
enough
to
look
.
It
was
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
pale
,
she
was
gloomy
.
Her
hair
fell
over
her
shoulders
as
in
the
*NL*
morning
;
but
there
was
no
longer
a
rope
on
her
neck
,
her
hands
were
no
*NL*
longer
bound
;
she
was
free
,
she
was
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
dressed
in
white
and
had
a
white
veil
on
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
came
towards
him
,
slowly
,
with
her
gaze
fixed
on
the
sky
.
The
*NL*
supernatural
goat
followed
her
.
He
felt
as
though
made
of
stone
and
*NL*
too
heavy
to
flee
.
At
every
step
which
she
took
in
advance
,
he
took
one
*NL*
backwards
,
and
that
was
all
.
In
this
way
he
retreated
once
more
beneath
*NL*
the
gloomy
arch
of
the
stairway
.
He
was
chilled
by
the
thought
that
she
*NL*
might
enter
there
also
;
had
she
done
so
,
he
would
have
died
of
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
arrive
,
in
fact
,
in
front
of
the
door
to
the
stairway
,
and
*NL*
paused
there
for
several
minutes
,
stared
intently
into
the
darkness
,
but
*NL*
without
appearing
to
see
the
priest
,
and
passed
on
.
She
seemed
taller
*NL*
to
him
than
when
she
had
been
alive
;
he
saw
the
moon
through
her
white
*NL*
robe
;
he
heard
her
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
had
passed
on
,
he
began
to
descend
the
staircase
again
,
with
*NL*
the
slowness
which
he
had
observed
in
the
spectre
,
believing
himself
to
*NL*
be
a
spectre
too
,
haggard
,
with
hair
on
end
,
his
extinguished
lamp
still
*NL*
in
his
hand
;
and
as
he
descended
the
spiral
steps
,
he
distinctly
heard
*NL*
in
his
ear
a
voice
laughing
and
repeating
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
spirit
passed
before
my
face
,
and
I
heard
a
small
voice
,
and
the
hair
*NL*
of
my
flesh
stood
up
.

CHAPTER
II
.
HUNCHBACKED
,
ONE
EYED
,
LAME
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Every
city
during
the
Middle
Ages
,
and
every
city
in
France
down
to
the
*NL*
time
of
Louis
XII
.
had
its
places
of
asylum
.
These
sanctuaries
,
in
the
*NL*
midst
of
the
deluge
of
penal
and
barbarous
jurisdictions
which
inundated
*NL*
the
city
,
were
a
species
of
islands
which
rose
above
the
level
of
human
*NL*
justice
.
Every
criminal
who
landed
there
was
safe
.
There
were
in
every
*NL*
suburb
almost
as
many
places
of
asylum
as
gallows
.
It
was
the
abuse
of
*NL*
impunity
by
the
side
of
the
abuse
of
punishment
;
two
bad
things
which
*NL*
strove
to
correct
each
other
.
The
palaces
of
the
king
,
the
hotels
of
*NL*
the
princes
,
and
especially
churches
,
possessed
the
right
of
asylum
.
*NL*
Sometimes
a
whole
city
which
stood
in
need
of
being
repeopled
was
*NL*
temporarily
created
a
place
of
refuge
.
Louis
XI
.
made
all
Paris
a
refuge
*NL*
in
1467
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
foot
once
within
the
asylum
,
the
criminal
was
sacred
;
but
he
must
*NL*
beware
of
leaving
it
;
one
step
outside
the
sanctuary
,
and
he
fell
back
*NL*
into
the
flood
.
The
wheel
,
the
gibbet
,
the
strappado
,
kept
good
guard
*NL*
around
the
place
of
refuge
,
and
lay
in
watch
incessantly
for
their
prey
,
*NL*
like
sharks
around
a
vessel
.
Hence
,
condemned
men
were
to
be
seen
whose
*NL*
hair
had
grown
white
in
a
cloister
,
on
the
steps
of
a
palace
,
in
the
*NL*
enclosure
of
an
abbey
,
beneath
the
porch
of
a
church
;
in
this
manner
the
*NL*
asylum
was
a
prison
as
much
as
any
other
.
It
sometimes
happened
that
*NL*
a
solemn
decree
of
parliament
violated
the
asylum
and
restored
the
*NL*
condemned
man
to
the
executioner
;
but
this
was
of
rare
occurrence
.
*NL*
Parliaments
were
afraid
of
the
bishops
,
and
when
there
was
friction
*NL*
between
these
two
robes
,
the
gown
had
but
a
poor
chance
against
the
*NL*
cassock
.
Sometimes
,
however
,
as
in
the
affair
of
the
assassins
of
*NL*
Petit-Jean
,
the
headsman
of
Paris
,
and
in
that
of
Emery
Rousseau
,
the
*NL*
murderer
of
Jean
Valleret
,
justice
overleaped
the
church
and
passed
on
*NL*
to
the
execution
of
its
sentences
;
but
unless
by
virtue
of
a
decree
of
*NL*
Parliament
,
woe
to
him
who
violated
a
place
of
asylum
with
armed
force
!
*NL*
The
reader
knows
the
manner
of
death
of
Robert
de
Clermont
,
Marshal
*NL*
of
France
,
and
of
Jean
de
Chalons
,
Marshal
of
Champagne
;
and
yet
*NL*
the
question
was
only
of
a
certain
Perrin
Marc
,
the
clerk
of
a
*NL*
money-changer
,
a
miserable
assassin
;
but
the
two
marshals
had
broken
the
*NL*
doors
of
St.
Mery
.
Therein
lay
the
enormity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
respect
was
cherished
for
places
of
refuge
that
,
according
to
*NL*
tradition
,
animals
even
felt
it
at
times
.
Aymoire
relates
that
a
*NL*
stag
,
being
chased
by
Dagobert
,
having
taken
refuge
near
the
tomb
of
*NL*
Saint-Denis
,
the
pack
of
hounds
stopped
short
and
barked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Churches
generally
had
a
small
apartment
prepared
for
the
reception
of
*NL*
supplicants
.
In
1407
,
Nicolas
Flamel
caused
to
be
built
on
the
vaults
of
*NL*
Saint-Jacques
de
la
Boucherie
,
a
chamber
which
cost
him
four
livres
six
*NL*
sous
,
sixteen
farthings
,
parisis
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
Notre-Dame
it
was
a
tiny
cell
situated
on
the
roof
of
the
side
aisle
,
*NL*
beneath
the
flying
buttresses
,
precisely
at
the
spot
where
the
wife
of
*NL*
the
present
janitor
of
the
towers
has
made
for
herself
a
garden
,
which
*NL*
is
to
the
hanging
gardens
of
Babylon
what
a
lettuce
is
to
a
palm-tree
,
*NL*
what
a
porter
's
wife
is
to
a
Semiramis
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
here
that
Quasimodo
had
deposited
la
Esmeralda
,
after
his
wild
*NL*
and
triumphant
course
.
As
long
as
that
course
lasted
,
the
young
girl
*NL*
had
been
unable
to
recover
her
senses
,
half
unconscious
,
half
awake
,
no
*NL*
longer
feeling
anything
,
except
that
she
was
mounting
through
the
air
,
*NL*
floating
in
it
,
flying
in
it
,
that
something
was
raising
her
above
the
*NL*
earth
.
From
time
to
time
she
heard
the
loud
laughter
,
the
noisy
voice
*NL*
of
Quasimodo
in
her
ear
;
she
half
opened
her
eyes
;
then
below
her
she
*NL*
confusedly
beheld
Paris
checkered
with
its
thousand
roofs
of
slate
and
*NL*
tiles
,
like
a
red
and
blue
mosaic
,
above
her
head
the
frightful
and
*NL*
joyous
face
of
Quasimodo
.
Then
her
eyelids
drooped
again
;
she
thought
*NL*
that
all
was
over
,
that
they
had
executed
her
during
her
swoon
,
and
that
*NL*
the
misshapen
spirit
which
had
presided
over
her
destiny
,
had
laid
hold
*NL*
of
her
and
was
bearing
her
away
.
She
dared
not
look
at
him
,
and
she
*NL*
surrendered
herself
to
her
fate
.
But
when
the
bellringer
,
dishevelled
*NL*
and
panting
,
had
deposited
her
in
the
cell
of
refuge
,
when
she
felt
his
*NL*
huge
hands
gently
detaching
the
cord
which
bruised
her
arms
,
she
felt
*NL*
that
sort
of
shock
which
awakens
with
a
start
the
passengers
of
a
vessel
*NL*
which
runs
aground
in
the
middle
of
a
dark
night
.
Her
thoughts
*NL*
awoke
also
,
and
returned
to
her
one
by
one
.
She
saw
that
she
was
in
*NL*
Notre-Dame
;
she
remembered
having
been
torn
from
the
hands
of
the
*NL*
executioner
;
that
Phoebus
was
alive
,
that
Phoebus
loved
her
no
longer
;
*NL*
and
as
these
two
ideas
,
one
of
which
shed
so
much
bitterness
over
the
*NL*
other
,
presented
themselves
simultaneously
to
the
poor
condemned
girl
;
*NL*
she
turned
to
Quasimodo
,
who
was
standing
in
front
of
her
,
and
who
*NL*
terrified
her
;
she
said
to
him
,
--
``
Why
have
you
saved
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
gazed
at
her
with
anxiety
,
as
though
seeking
to
divine
what
she
was
*NL*
saying
to
him
.
She
repeated
her
question
.
Then
he
gave
her
a
profoundly
*NL*
sorrowful
glance
and
fled
.
She
was
astonished
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
moments
later
he
returned
,
bearing
a
package
which
he
cast
at
*NL*
her
feet
.
It
was
clothing
which
some
charitable
women
had
left
on
the
*NL*
threshold
of
the
church
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
dropped
her
eyes
upon
herself
and
saw
that
she
was
almost
*NL*
naked
,
and
blushed
.
Life
had
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
Quasimodo
appeared
to
experience
something
of
this
modesty
.
He
covered
*NL*
his
eyes
with
his
large
hand
and
retired
once
more
,
but
slowly
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
made
haste
to
dress
herself
.
The
robe
was
a
white
one
with
a
white
*NL*
veil
,
--
the
garb
of
a
novice
of
the
Hotel-Dien
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
barely
finished
when
she
beheld
Quasimodo
returning
.
He
carried
*NL*
a
basket
under
one
arm
and
a
mattress
under
the
other
.
In
the
basket
*NL*
there
was
a
bottle
,
bread
,
and
some
provisions
.
He
set
the
basket
on
the
*NL*
floor
and
said
,
``
Eat
!
''
He
spread
the
mattress
on
the
flagging
and
said
,
*NL*
``
Sleep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
his
own
repast
,
it
was
his
own
bed
,
which
the
bellringer
had
gone
*NL*
in
search
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gypsy
raised
her
eyes
to
thank
him
,
but
she
could
not
articulate
a
*NL*
word
.
She
dropped
her
head
with
a
quiver
of
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
said
to
her
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
frighten
you
.
I
am
very
ugly
,
am
I
not
?
Do
not
look
at
me
;
only
*NL*
listen
to
me
.
During
the
day
you
will
remain
here
;
at
night
you
can
walk
*NL*
all
over
the
church
.
But
do
not
leave
the
church
either
by
day
or
by
*NL*
night
.
You
would
be
lost
.
They
would
kill
you
,
and
I
should
die
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
touched
and
raised
her
head
to
answer
him
.
He
had
disappeared
.
*NL*
She
found
herself
alone
once
more
,
meditating
upon
the
singular
words
of
*NL*
this
almost
monstrous
being
,
and
struck
by
the
sound
of
his
voice
,
which
*NL*
was
so
hoarse
yet
so
gentle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
examined
her
cell
.
It
was
a
chamber
about
six
feet
square
,
*NL*
with
a
small
window
and
a
door
on
the
slightly
sloping
plane
of
the
roof
*NL*
formed
of
flat
stones
.
Many
gutters
with
the
figures
of
animals
seemed
*NL*
to
be
bending
down
around
her
,
and
stretching
their
necks
in
order
to
*NL*
stare
at
her
through
the
window
.
Over
the
edge
of
her
roof
she
perceived
*NL*
the
tops
of
thousands
of
chimneys
which
caused
the
smoke
of
all
the
*NL*
fires
in
Paris
to
rise
beneath
her
eyes
.
A
sad
sight
for
the
poor
gypsy
,
*NL*
a
foundling
,
condemned
to
death
,
an
unhappy
creature
,
without
country
,
*NL*
without
family
,
without
a
hearthstone
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
moment
when
the
thought
of
her
isolation
thus
appeared
to
her
*NL*
more
poignant
than
ever
,
she
felt
a
bearded
and
hairy
head
glide
between
*NL*
her
hands
,
upon
her
knees
.
She
started
-LRB-
everything
alarmed
her
now
-RRB-
and
*NL*
looked
.
It
was
the
poor
goat
,
the
agile
Djali
,
which
had
made
its
escape
*NL*
after
her
,
at
the
moment
when
Quasimodo
had
put
to
flight
Charmolue
's
*NL*
brigade
,
and
which
had
been
lavishing
caresses
on
her
feet
for
nearly
*NL*
an
hour
past
,
without
being
able
to
win
a
glance
.
The
gypsy
covered
him
*NL*
with
kisses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Djali
!
''
she
said
,
``
how
I
have
forgotten
thee
!
And
so
thou
still
*NL*
thinkest
of
me
!
Oh
!
thou
art
not
an
ingrate
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
time
,
as
though
an
invisible
hand
had
lifted
the
weight
*NL*
which
had
repressed
her
tears
in
her
heart
for
so
long
,
she
began
to
*NL*
weep
,
and
,
in
proportion
as
her
tears
flowed
,
she
felt
all
that
was
most
*NL*
acrid
and
bitter
in
her
grief
depart
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Evening
came
,
she
thought
the
night
so
beautiful
that
she
made
the
*NL*
circuit
of
the
elevated
gallery
which
surrounds
the
church
.
It
afforded
*NL*
her
some
relief
,
so
calm
did
the
earth
appear
when
viewed
from
that
*NL*
height
.

CHAPTER
III
.
DEAF
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
following
morning
,
she
perceived
on
awaking
,
that
she
had
*NL*
been
asleep
.
This
singular
thing
astonished
her
.
She
had
been
so
long
*NL*
unaccustomed
to
sleep
!
A
joyous
ray
of
the
rising
sun
entered
through
*NL*
her
window
and
touched
her
face
.
At
the
same
time
with
the
sun
,
she
*NL*
beheld
at
that
window
an
object
which
frightened
her
,
the
unfortunate
*NL*
face
of
Quasimodo
.
She
involuntarily
closed
her
eyes
again
,
but
in
vain
;
*NL*
she
fancied
that
she
still
saw
through
the
rosy
lids
that
gnome
's
mask
,
*NL*
one-eyed
and
gap-toothed
.
Then
,
while
she
still
kept
her
eyes
closed
,
*NL*
she
heard
a
rough
voice
saying
,
very
gently
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
not
afraid
.
I
am
your
friend
.
I
came
to
watch
you
sleep
.
It
does
not
*NL*
hurt
you
if
I
come
to
see
you
sleep
,
does
it
?
What
difference
does
it
*NL*
make
to
you
if
I
am
here
when
your
eyes
are
closed
!
Now
I
am
going
.
*NL*
Stay
,
I
have
placed
myself
behind
the
wall
.
You
can
open
your
eyes
*NL*
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
something
more
plaintive
than
these
words
,
and
that
was
the
*NL*
accent
in
which
they
were
uttered
.
The
gypsy
,
much
touched
,
opened
*NL*
her
eyes
.
He
was
,
in
fact
,
no
longer
at
the
window
.
She
approached
the
*NL*
opening
,
and
beheld
the
poor
hunchback
crouching
in
an
angle
of
the
*NL*
wall
,
in
a
sad
and
resigned
attitude
.
She
made
an
effort
to
surmount
the
*NL*
repugnance
with
which
he
inspired
her
.
``
Come
,
''
she
said
to
him
gently
.
*NL*
From
the
movement
of
the
gypsy
's
lips
,
Quasimodo
thought
that
she
*NL*
was
driving
him
away
;
then
he
rose
and
retired
limping
,
slowly
,
with
*NL*
drooping
head
,
without
even
daring
to
raise
to
the
young
girl
his
gaze
*NL*
full
of
despair
.
``
Do
come
,
''
she
cried
,
but
he
continued
to
retreat
.
Then
*NL*
she
darted
from
her
cell
,
ran
to
him
,
and
grasped
his
arm
.
On
feeling
*NL*
her
touch
him
,
Quasimodo
trembled
in
every
limb
.
He
raised
his
suppliant
*NL*
eye
,
and
seeing
that
she
was
leading
him
back
to
her
quarters
,
his
whole
*NL*
face
beamed
with
joy
and
tenderness
.
She
tried
to
make
him
enter
the
*NL*
cell
;
but
he
persisted
in
remaining
on
the
threshold
.
``
No
,
no
,
''
said
he
;
*NL*
``
the
owl
enters
not
the
nest
of
the
lark
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
crouched
down
gracefully
on
her
couch
,
with
her
goat
asleep
at
*NL*
her
feet
.
Both
remained
motionless
for
several
moments
,
considering
*NL*
in
silence
,
she
so
much
grace
,
he
so
much
ugliness
.
Every
moment
she
*NL*
discovered
some
fresh
deformity
in
Quasimodo
.
Her
glance
travelled
from
*NL*
his
knock
knees
to
his
humped
back
,
from
his
humped
back
to
his
only
*NL*
eye
.
She
could
not
comprehend
the
existence
of
a
being
so
awkwardly
*NL*
fashioned
.
Yet
there
was
so
much
sadness
and
so
much
gentleness
spread
*NL*
over
all
this
,
that
she
began
to
become
reconciled
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
the
first
to
break
the
silence
.
``
So
you
were
telling
me
to
*NL*
return
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
made
an
affirmative
sign
of
the
head
,
and
said
,
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
understood
the
motion
of
the
head
.
``
Alas
!
''
he
said
,
as
though
*NL*
hesitating
whether
to
finish
,
``
I
am
--
I
am
deaf
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
man
!
''
exclaimed
the
Bohemian
,
with
an
expression
of
kindly
pity
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
began
to
smile
sadly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
think
that
that
was
all
that
I
lacked
,
do
you
not
?
Yes
,
I
am
*NL*
deaf
,
that
is
the
way
I
am
made
.
'T
is
horrible
,
is
it
not
?
You
are
so
*NL*
beautiful
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
lay
in
the
accents
of
the
wretched
man
so
profound
a
consciousness
*NL*
of
his
misery
,
that
she
had
not
the
strength
to
say
a
word
.
Besides
,
he
*NL*
would
not
have
heard
her
.
He
went
on
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
have
I
seen
my
ugliness
as
at
the
present
moment
.
When
I
compare
*NL*
myself
to
you
,
I
feel
a
very
great
pity
for
myself
,
poor
unhappy
monster
*NL*
that
I
am
!
Tell
me
,
I
must
look
to
you
like
a
beast
.
You
,
you
are
a
*NL*
ray
of
sunshine
,
a
drop
of
dew
,
the
song
of
a
bird
!
I
am
something
*NL*
frightful
,
neither
man
nor
animal
,
I
know
not
what
,
harder
,
more
*NL*
trampled
under
foot
,
and
more
unshapely
than
a
pebble
stone
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
began
to
laugh
,
and
that
laugh
was
the
most
heartbreaking
thing
*NL*
in
the
world
.
He
continued
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
am
deaf
;
but
you
shall
talk
to
me
by
gestures
,
by
signs
.
I
have
*NL*
a
master
who
talks
with
me
in
that
way
.
And
then
,
I
shall
very
soon
know
*NL*
your
wish
from
the
movement
of
your
lips
,
from
your
look
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
she
interposed
with
a
smile
,
``
tell
me
why
you
saved
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
watched
her
attentively
while
she
was
speaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
,
''
he
replied
.
``
You
ask
me
why
I
saved
you
.
You
have
*NL*
forgotten
a
wretch
who
tried
to
abduct
you
one
night
,
a
wretch
to
whom
*NL*
you
rendered
succor
on
the
following
day
on
their
infamous
pillory
.
A
*NL*
drop
of
water
and
a
little
pity
,
--
that
is
more
than
I
can
repay
with
my
*NL*
life
.
You
have
forgotten
that
wretch
;
but
he
remembers
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
listened
to
him
with
profound
tenderness
.
A
tear
swam
in
the
eye
of
*NL*
the
bellringer
,
but
did
not
fall
.
He
seemed
to
make
it
a
sort
of
point
*NL*
of
honor
to
retain
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
''
he
resumed
,
when
he
was
no
longer
afraid
that
the
tear
would
*NL*
escape
;
``
our
towers
here
are
very
high
,
a
man
who
should
fall
from
them
*NL*
would
be
dead
before
touching
the
pavement
;
when
it
shall
please
you
*NL*
to
have
me
fall
,
you
will
not
have
to
utter
even
a
word
,
a
glance
will
*NL*
suffice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
rose
.
Unhappy
as
was
the
Bohemian
,
this
eccentric
being
still
*NL*
aroused
some
compassion
in
her
.
She
made
him
a
sign
to
remain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
''
said
he
;
``
I
must
not
remain
too
long
.
I
am
not
at
my
ease
.
It
*NL*
is
out
of
pity
that
you
do
not
turn
away
your
eyes
.
I
shall
go
to
some
*NL*
place
where
I
can
see
you
without
your
seeing
me
:
it
will
be
better
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
drew
from
his
pocket
a
little
metal
whistle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
''
said
he
,
``
when
you
have
need
of
me
,
when
you
wish
me
to
come
,
*NL*
when
you
will
not
feel
too
ranch
horror
at
the
sight
of
me
,
use
this
*NL*
whistle
.
I
can
hear
this
sound
.

*NL*
*NL*
He
laid
the
whistle
on
the
floor
and
fled

Day
followed
day
.
Calm
gradually
returned
to
the
soul
of
la
Esmeralda
.
*NL*
Excess
of
grief
,
like
excess
of
joy
is
a
violent
thing
which
lasts
but
*NL*
a
short
time
.
The
heart
of
man
can
not
remain
long
in
one
extremity
.
The
*NL*
gypsy
had
suffered
so
much
,
that
nothing
was
left
her
but
astonishment
.
*NL*
With
security
,
hope
had
returned
to
her
.
She
was
outside
the
pale
of
*NL*
society
,
outside
the
pale
of
life
,
but
she
had
a
vague
feeling
that
it
*NL*
might
not
be
impossible
to
return
to
it
.
She
was
like
a
dead
person
,
who
*NL*
should
hold
in
reserve
the
key
to
her
tomb
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
felt
the
terrible
images
which
had
so
long
persecuted
her
,
*NL*
gradually
departing
.
All
the
hideous
phantoms
,
Pierrat
Torterue
,
Jacques
*NL*
Charmolue
,
were
effaced
from
her
mind
,
all
,
even
the
priest
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
,
Phoebus
was
alive
;
she
was
sure
of
it
,
she
had
seen
him
.
To
*NL*
her
the
fact
of
Phoebus
being
alive
was
everything
.
After
the
series
of
*NL*
fatal
shocks
which
had
overturned
everything
within
her
,
she
had
found
*NL*
but
one
thing
intact
in
her
soul
,
one
sentiment
,
--
her
love
for
the
*NL*
captain
.
Love
is
like
a
tree
;
it
sprouts
forth
of
itself
,
sends
its
*NL*
roots
out
deeply
through
our
whole
being
,
and
often
continues
to
*NL*
flourish
greenly
over
a
heart
in
ruins
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
inexplicable
point
about
it
is
that
the
more
blind
is
this
*NL*
passion
,
the
more
tenacious
it
is
.
It
is
never
more
solid
than
when
it
*NL*
has
no
reason
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
La
Esmeralda
did
not
think
of
the
captain
without
bitterness
,
no
doubt
.
*NL*
No
doubt
it
was
terrible
that
he
also
should
have
been
deceived
;
that
he
*NL*
should
have
believed
that
impossible
thing
,
that
he
could
have
conceived
*NL*
of
a
stab
dealt
by
her
who
would
have
given
a
thousand
lives
for
him
.
*NL*
But
,
after
all
,
she
must
not
be
too
angry
with
him
for
it
;
had
she
not
*NL*
confessed
her
crime
?
had
she
not
yielded
,
weak
woman
that
she
was
,
to
*NL*
torture
?
The
fault
was
entirely
hers
.
She
should
have
allowed
her
finger
*NL*
nails
to
be
torn
out
rather
than
such
a
word
to
be
wrenched
from
her
.
In
*NL*
short
,
if
she
could
but
see
Phoebus
once
more
,
for
a
single
minute
,
*NL*
only
one
word
would
be
required
,
one
look
,
in
order
to
undeceive
him
,
*NL*
to
bring
him
back
.
She
did
not
doubt
it
.
She
was
astonished
also
at
many
*NL*
singular
things
,
at
the
accident
of
Phoebus
's
presence
on
the
day
of
the
*NL*
penance
,
at
the
young
girl
with
whom
he
had
been
.
She
was
his
sister
,
no
*NL*
doubt
.
An
unreasonable
explanation
,
but
she
contented
herself
with
it
,
*NL*
because
she
needed
to
believe
that
Phoebus
still
loved
her
,
and
loved
*NL*
her
alone
.
Had
he
not
sworn
it
to
her
?
What
more
was
needed
,
simple
and
*NL*
credulous
as
she
was
?
And
then
,
in
this
matter
,
were
not
appearances
*NL*
much
more
against
her
than
against
him
?
Accordingly
,
she
waited
.
She
*NL*
hoped
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
add
that
the
church
,
that
vast
church
,
which
surrounded
her
on
*NL*
every
side
,
which
guarded
her
,
which
saved
her
,
was
itself
a
sovereign
*NL*
tranquillizer
.
The
solemn
lines
of
that
architecture
,
the
religious
*NL*
attitude
of
all
the
objects
which
surrounded
the
young
girl
,
the
serene
*NL*
and
pious
thoughts
which
emanated
,
so
to
speak
,
from
all
the
pores
of
*NL*
that
stone
,
acted
upon
her
without
her
being
aware
of
it
.
The
edifice
*NL*
had
also
sounds
fraught
with
such
benediction
and
such
majesty
,
*NL*
that
they
soothed
this
ailing
soul
.
The
monotonous
chanting
of
the
*NL*
celebrants
,
the
responses
of
the
people
to
the
priest
,
sometimes
*NL*
inarticulate
,
sometimes
thunderous
,
the
harmonious
trembling
of
the
*NL*
painted
windows
,
the
organ
,
bursting
forth
like
a
hundred
trumpets
,
the
*NL*
three
belfries
,
humming
like
hives
of
huge
bees
,
that
whole
orchestra
on
*NL*
which
bounded
a
gigantic
scale
,
ascending
,
descending
incessantly
*NL*
from
the
voice
of
a
throng
to
that
of
one
bell
,
dulled
her
memory
,
her
*NL*
imagination
,
her
grief
.
The
bells
,
in
particular
,
lulled
her
.
It
was
*NL*
something
like
a
powerful
magnetism
which
those
vast
instruments
shed
*NL*
over
her
in
great
waves
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
every
sunrise
found
her
more
calm
,
breathing
better
,
less
pale
.
In
*NL*
proportion
as
her
inward
wounds
closed
,
her
grace
and
beauty
blossomed
*NL*
once
more
on
her
countenance
,
but
more
thoughtful
,
more
reposeful
.
Her
*NL*
former
character
also
returned
to
her
,
somewhat
even
of
her
gayety
,
her
*NL*
pretty
pout
,
her
love
for
her
goat
,
her
love
for
singing
,
her
modesty
.
*NL*
She
took
care
to
dress
herself
in
the
morning
in
the
corner
of
her
*NL*
cell
for
fear
some
inhabitants
of
the
neighboring
attics
might
see
her
*NL*
through
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
thought
of
Phoebus
left
her
time
,
the
gypsy
sometimes
thought
*NL*
of
Quasimodo
.
He
was
the
sole
bond
,
the
sole
connection
,
the
sole
*NL*
communication
which
remained
to
her
with
men
,
with
the
living
.
*NL*
Unfortunate
girl
!
she
was
more
outside
the
world
than
Quasimodo
.
She
*NL*
understood
not
in
the
least
the
strange
friend
whom
chance
had
given
*NL*
her
.
She
often
reproached
herself
for
not
feeling
a
gratitude
which
*NL*
should
close
her
eyes
,
but
decidedly
,
she
could
not
accustom
herself
to
*NL*
the
poor
bellringer
.
He
was
too
ugly
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
left
the
whistle
which
he
had
given
her
lying
on
the
ground
.
*NL*
This
did
not
prevent
Quasimodo
from
making
his
appearance
from
time
to
*NL*
time
during
the
first
few
days
.
She
did
her
best
not
to
turn
aside
with
*NL*
too
much
repugnance
when
he
came
to
bring
her
her
basket
of
provisions
*NL*
or
her
jug
of
water
,
but
he
always
perceived
the
slightest
movement
of
*NL*
this
sort
,
and
then
he
withdrew
sadly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
he
came
at
the
moment
when
she
was
caressing
Djali
.
He
stood
*NL*
pensively
for
several
minutes
before
this
graceful
group
of
the
goat
and
*NL*
the
gypsy
;
at
last
he
said
,
shaking
his
heavy
and
ill-formed
head
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
misfortune
is
that
I
still
resemble
a
man
too
much
.
I
should
like
to
*NL*
be
wholly
a
beast
like
that
goat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
gazed
at
him
in
amazement
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
replied
to
the
glance
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
I
well
know
why
,
''
and
he
went
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
another
occasion
he
presented
himself
at
the
door
of
the
cell
-LRB-
which
*NL*
he
never
entered
-RRB-
at
the
moment
when
la
Esmeralda
was
singing
an
old
*NL*
Spanish
ballad
,
the
words
of
which
she
did
not
understand
,
but
which
had
*NL*
lingered
in
her
ear
because
the
gypsy
women
had
lulled
her
to
sleep
*NL*
with
it
when
she
was
a
little
child
.
At
the
sight
of
that
villanous
form
*NL*
which
made
its
appearance
so
abruptly
in
the
middle
of
her
song
,
the
*NL*
young
girl
paused
with
an
involuntary
gesture
of
alarm
.
The
unhappy
*NL*
bellringer
fell
upon
his
knees
on
the
threshold
,
and
clasped
his
large
,
*NL*
misshapen
hands
with
a
suppliant
air
.
``
Oh
!
''
he
said
,
sorrowfully
,
*NL*
``
continue
,
I
implore
you
,
and
do
not
drive
me
away
.
''
She
did
not
wish
to
*NL*
pain
him
,
and
resumed
her
lay
,
trembling
all
over
.
By
degrees
,
however
,
*NL*
her
terror
disappeared
,
and
she
yielded
herself
wholly
to
the
slow
and
*NL*
melancholy
air
which
she
was
singing
.
He
remained
on
his
knees
with
*NL*
hands
clasped
,
as
in
prayer
,
attentive
,
hardly
breathing
,
his
gaze
*NL*
riveted
upon
the
gypsy
's
brilliant
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
another
occasion
,
he
came
to
her
with
an
awkward
and
timid
air
.
*NL*
``
Listen
,
''
he
said
,
with
an
effort
;
``
I
have
something
to
say
to
you
.
''
*NL*
She
made
him
a
sign
that
she
was
listening
.
Then
he
began
to
sigh
,
half
*NL*
opened
his
lips
,
appeared
for
a
moment
to
be
on
the
point
of
speaking
,
*NL*
then
he
looked
at
her
again
,
shook
his
head
,
and
withdrew
slowly
,
with
*NL*
his
brow
in
his
hand
,
leaving
the
gypsy
stupefied
.
Among
the
grotesque
*NL*
personages
sculptured
on
the
wall
,
there
was
one
to
whom
he
was
*NL*
particularly
attached
,
and
with
which
he
often
seemed
to
exchange
*NL*
fraternal
glances
.
Once
the
gypsy
heard
him
saying
to
it
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
why
am
not
I
of
stone
,
like
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
one
morning
,
la
Esmeralda
had
advanced
to
the
edge
of
the
roof
,
*NL*
and
was
looking
into
the
Place
over
the
pointed
roof
of
Saint-Jean
le
*NL*
Rond
.
Quasimodo
was
standing
behind
her
.
He
had
placed
himself
in
that
*NL*
position
in
order
to
spare
the
young
girl
,
as
far
as
possible
,
the
*NL*
displeasure
of
seeing
him
.
All
at
once
the
gypsy
started
,
a
tear
and
a
*NL*
flash
of
joy
gleamed
simultaneously
in
her
eyes
,
she
knelt
on
the
*NL*
brink
of
the
roof
and
extended
her
arms
towards
the
Place
with
anguish
,
*NL*
exclaiming
:
``
Phoebus
!
come
!
come
!
a
word
,
a
single
word
in
the
name
of
*NL*
heaven
!
Phoebus
!
Phoebus
!
''
Her
voice
,
her
face
,
her
gesture
,
her
whole
*NL*
person
bore
the
heartrending
expression
of
a
shipwrecked
man
who
is
*NL*
making
a
signal
of
distress
to
the
joyous
vessel
which
is
passing
afar
*NL*
off
in
a
ray
of
sunlight
on
the
horizon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Quasimodo
leaned
over
the
Place
,
and
saw
that
the
object
of
this
tender
*NL*
and
agonizing
prayer
was
a
young
man
,
a
captain
,
a
handsome
cavalier
*NL*
all
glittering
with
arms
and
decorations
,
prancing
across
the
end
of
the
*NL*
Place
,
and
saluting
with
his
plume
a
beautiful
lady
who
was
smiling
at
*NL*
him
from
her
balcony
.
However
,
the
officer
did
not
hear
the
unhappy
girl
*NL*
calling
him
;
he
was
too
far
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
poor
deaf
man
heard
.
A
profound
sigh
heaved
his
breast
;
he
*NL*
turned
round
;
his
heart
was
swollen
with
all
the
tears
which
he
was
*NL*
swallowing
;
his
convulsively-clenched
fists
struck
against
his
head
,
and
*NL*
when
he
withdrew
them
there
was
a
bunch
of
red
hair
in
each
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gypsy
paid
no
heed
to
him
.
He
said
in
a
low
voice
as
he
gnashed
his
*NL*
teeth
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Damnation
!
That
is
what
one
should
be
like
!
'T
is
only
necessary
to
be
*NL*
handsome
on
the
outside
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
she
remained
kneeling
,
and
cried
with
extraor-dinary
*NL*
agitation
,
--
``
Oh
!
there
he
is
alighting
from
his
horse
!
He
is
about
to
*NL*
enter
that
house
!
--
Phoebus
!
--
He
does
not
hear
me
!
Phoebus
!
--
How
wicked
*NL*
that
woman
is
to
speak
to
him
at
the
same
time
with
me
!
Phoebus
!
*NL*
Phoebus
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
deaf
man
gazed
at
her
.
He
understood
this
pantomime
.
The
poor
*NL*
bellringer
's
eye
filled
with
tears
,
but
he
let
none
fall
.
All
at
once
he
*NL*
pulled
her
gently
by
the
border
of
her
sleeve
.
She
turned
round
.
He
had
*NL*
assumed
a
tranquil
air
;
he
said
to
her
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
like
to
have
me
bring
him
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
go
!
hasten
!
run
!
quick
!
that
captain
!
that
captain
!
bring
him
to
*NL*
me
!
I
will
love
you
for
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
clasped
his
knees
.
He
could
not
refrain
from
shaking
his
head
sadly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
bring
him
to
you
,
''
he
said
,
in
a
weak
voice
.
Then
he
turned
his
*NL*
head
and
plunged
down
the
staircase
with
great
strides
,
stifling
with
*NL*
sobs
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
reached
the
Place
,
he
no
longer
saw
anything
except
the
handsome
*NL*
horse
hitched
at
the
door
of
the
Gondelaurier
house
;
the
captain
had
*NL*
just
entered
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
raised
his
eyes
to
the
roof
of
the
church
.
La
Esmeralda
was
there
*NL*
in
the
same
spot
,
in
the
same
attitude
.
He
made
her
a
sad
sign
with
his
*NL*
head
;
then
he
planted
his
back
against
one
of
the
stone
posts
of
the
*NL*
Gondelaurier
porch
,
determined
to
wait
until
the
captain
should
come
*NL*
forth
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
Gondelaurier
house
it
was
one
of
those
gala
days
which
precede
*NL*
a
wedding
.
Quasimodo
beheld
many
people
enter
,
but
no
one
come
out
.
He
*NL*
cast
a
glance
towards
the
roof
from
time
to
time
;
the
gypsy
did
not
stir
*NL*
any
more
than
himself
.
A
groom
came
and
unhitched
the
horse
and
led
it
*NL*
to
the
stable
of
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
entire
day
passed
thus
,
Quasimodo
at
his
post
,
la
Esmeralda
on
the
*NL*
roof
,
Phoebus
,
no
doubt
,
at
the
feet
of
Fleur-de-Lys
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
night
came
,
a
moonless
night
,
a
dark
night
.
Quasimodo
*NL*
fixed
his
gaze
in
vain
upon
la
Esmeralda
;
soon
she
was
no
more
than
*NL*
a
whiteness
amid
the
twilight
;
then
nothing
.
All
was
effaced
,
all
was
*NL*
black
.
*NL*
*NL*
Quasimodo
beheld
the
front
windows
from
top
to
bottom
of
the
*NL*
Gondelaurier
mansion
illuminated
;
he
saw
the
other
casements
in
the
*NL*
Place
lighted
one
by
one
,
he
also
saw
them
extinguished
to
the
very
*NL*
last
,
for
he
remained
the
whole
evening
at
his
post
.
The
officer
did
not
*NL*
come
forth
.
When
the
last
passers-by
had
returned
home
,
when
the
windows
*NL*
of
all
the
other
houses
were
extinguished
,
Quasimodo
was
left
entirely
*NL*
alone
,
entirely
in
the
dark
.
There
were
at
that
time
no
lamps
in
the
*NL*
square
before
Notre-Dame
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
the
windows
of
the
Gondelaurier
mansion
remained
lighted
,
*NL*
even
after
midnight
.
Quasimodo
,
motionless
and
attentive
,
beheld
a
*NL*
throng
of
lively
,
dancing
shadows
pass
athwart
the
many-colored
*NL*
painted
panes
.
Had
he
not
been
deaf
,
he
would
have
heard
more
and
more
*NL*
distinctly
,
in
proportion
as
the
noise
of
sleeping
Paris
died
away
,
a
*NL*
sound
of
feasting
,
laughter
,
and
music
in
the
Gondelaurier
mansion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
one
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
the
guests
began
to
take
their
*NL*
leave
.
Quasimodo
,
shrouded
in
darkness
watched
them
all
pass
out
through
*NL*
the
porch
illuminated
with
torches
.
None
of
them
was
the
captain
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
filled
with
sad
thoughts
;
at
times
he
looked
upwards
into
the
*NL*
air
,
like
a
person
who
is
weary
of
waiting
.
Great
black
clouds
,
heavy
,
*NL*
torn
,
split
,
hung
like
crape
hammocks
beneath
the
starry
dome
of
night
.
*NL*
One
would
have
pronounced
them
spiders
'
webs
of
the
vault
of
heaven
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
one
of
these
moments
he
suddenly
beheld
the
long
window
on
the
*NL*
balcony
,
whose
stone
balustrade
projected
above
his
head
,
open
*NL*
mysteriously
.
The
frail
glass
door
gave
passage
to
two
persons
,
and
*NL*
closed
noiselessly
behind
them
;
it
was
a
man
and
a
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
without
difficulty
that
Quasimodo
succeeded
in
recognizing
*NL*
in
the
man
the
handsome
captain
,
in
the
woman
the
young
lady
whom
he
*NL*
had
seen
welcome
the
officer
in
the
morning
from
that
very
balcony
.
The
*NL*
place
was
perfectly
dark
,
and
a
double
crimson
curtain
which
had
fallen
*NL*
across
the
door
the
very
moment
it
closed
again
,
allowed
no
light
to
*NL*
reach
the
balcony
from
the
apartment
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
and
the
young
girl
,
so
far
as
our
deaf
man
could
judge
,
*NL*
without
hearing
a
single
one
of
their
words
,
appeared
to
abandon
*NL*
themselves
to
a
very
tender
tete-a-tete
.
The
young
girl
seemed
to
have
*NL*
allowed
the
officer
to
make
a
girdle
for
her
of
his
arm
,
and
gently
*NL*
repulsed
a
kiss
.
*NL*
*NL*
Quasimodo
looked
on
from
below
at
this
scene
which
was
all
the
more
*NL*
pleasing
to
witness
because
it
was
not
meant
to
be
seen
.
He
contemplated
*NL*
with
bitterness
that
beauty
,
that
happiness
.
After
all
,
nature
was
not
*NL*
dumb
in
the
poor
fellow
,
and
his
human
sensibility
,
all
maliciously
*NL*
contorted
as
it
was
,
quivered
no
less
than
any
other
.
He
thought
of
the
*NL*
miserable
portion
which
Providence
had
allotted
to
him
;
that
woman
and
*NL*
the
pleasure
of
love
,
would
pass
forever
before
his
eyes
,
and
that
he
*NL*
should
never
do
anything
but
behold
the
felicity
of
others
.
But
that
*NL*
which
rent
his
heart
most
in
this
sight
,
that
which
mingled
indignation
*NL*
with
his
anger
,
was
the
thought
of
what
the
gypsy
would
suffer
could
she
*NL*
behold
it
.
It
is
true
that
the
night
was
very
dark
,
that
la
Esmeralda
,
*NL*
if
she
had
remained
at
her
post
-LRB-
and
he
had
no
doubt
of
this
-RRB-
,
was
very
*NL*
far
away
,
and
that
it
was
all
that
he
himself
could
do
to
distinguish
*NL*
the
lovers
on
the
balcony
.
This
consoled
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
their
conversation
grew
more
and
more
animated
.
The
young
*NL*
lady
appeared
to
be
entreating
the
officer
to
ask
nothing
more
of
her
.
*NL*
Of
all
this
Quasimodo
could
distinguish
only
the
beautiful
clasped
*NL*
hands
,
the
smiles
mingled
with
tears
,
the
young
girl
's
glances
directed
*NL*
to
the
stars
,
the
eyes
of
the
captain
lowered
ardently
upon
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fortunately
,
for
the
young
girl
was
beginning
to
resist
but
feebly
,
the
*NL*
door
of
the
balcony
suddenly
opened
once
more
and
an
old
dame
appeared
;
*NL*
the
beauty
seemed
confused
,
the
officer
assumed
an
air
of
displeasure
,
*NL*
and
all
three
withdrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
moment
later
,
a
horse
was
champing
his
bit
under
the
porch
,
and
the
*NL*
brilliant
officer
,
enveloped
in
his
night
cloak
,
passed
rapidly
before
*NL*
Quasimodo
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bellringer
allowed
him
to
turn
the
corner
of
the
street
,
then
he
ran
*NL*
after
him
with
his
ape-like
agility
,
shouting
:
``
Hey
there
!
captain
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
halted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
wants
this
knave
with
me
?
''
he
said
,
catching
sight
through
the
*NL*
gloom
of
that
hipshot
form
which
ran
limping
after
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
Quasimodo
had
caught
up
with
him
,
and
had
boldly
grasped
his
*NL*
horse
's
bridle
:
``
Follow
me
,
captain
;
there
is
one
here
who
desires
to
*NL*
speak
with
you
!
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Cornemahom
_
!
''
grumbled
Phoebus
,
``
here
's
a
villanous
;
ruffled
bird
*NL*
which
I
fancy
I
have
seen
somewhere
.
Hola
master
,
will
you
let
my
*NL*
horse
's
bridle
alone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Captain
,
''
replied
the
deaf
man
,
``
do
you
not
ask
me
who
it
is
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
to
release
my
horse
,
''
retorted
Phoebus
,
impatiently
.
``
What
*NL*
means
the
knave
by
clinging
to
the
bridle
of
my
steed
?
Do
you
take
my
*NL*
horse
for
a
gallows
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Quasimodo
,
far
from
releasing
the
bridle
,
prepared
to
force
him
to
*NL*
retrace
his
steps
.
Unable
to
comprehend
the
captain
's
resistance
,
he
*NL*
hastened
to
say
to
him
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
captain
,
't
is
a
woman
who
is
waiting
for
you
.
''
He
added
with
an
*NL*
effort
:
``
A
woman
who
loves
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
rare
rascal
!
''
said
the
captain
,
``
who
thinks
me
obliged
to
go
to
all
*NL*
the
women
who
love
me
!
or
who
say
they
do
.
And
what
if
,
by
chance
,
she
*NL*
should
resemble
you
,
you
face
of
a
screech-owl
?
Tell
the
woman
who
has
*NL*
sent
you
that
I
am
about
to
marry
,
and
that
she
may
go
to
the
devil
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
''
exclaimed
Quasimodo
,
thinking
to
overcome
his
hesitation
with
*NL*
a
word
,
``
come
,
monseigneur
!
't
is
the
gypsy
whom
you
know
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
word
did
,
indeed
,
produce
a
great
effect
on
Phoebus
,
but
not
of
the
*NL*
kind
which
the
deaf
man
expected
.
It
will
be
remembered
that
our
gallant
*NL*
officer
had
retired
with
Fleur-de-Lys
several
moments
before
Quasimodo
*NL*
had
rescued
the
condemned
girl
from
the
hands
of
Charmolue
.
Afterwards
,
*NL*
in
all
his
visits
to
the
Gondelaurier
mansion
he
had
taken
care
not
to
*NL*
mention
that
woman
,
the
memory
of
whom
was
,
after
all
,
painful
to
him
;
*NL*
and
on
her
side
,
Fleur-de-Lys
had
not
deemed
it
politic
to
tell
him
that
*NL*
the
gypsy
was
alive
.
Hence
Phoebus
believed
poor
``
Similar
''
to
be
dead
,
*NL*
and
that
a
month
or
two
had
elapsed
since
her
death
.
Let
us
add
that
*NL*
for
the
last
few
moments
the
captain
had
been
reflecting
on
the
profound
*NL*
darkness
of
the
night
,
the
supernatural
ugliness
,
the
sepulchral
voice
*NL*
of
the
strange
messenger
;
that
it
was
past
midnight
;
that
the
street
was
*NL*
deserted
,
as
on
the
evening
when
the
surly
monk
had
accosted
him
;
and
*NL*
that
his
horse
snorted
as
it
looked
at
Quasimodo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
gypsy
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
almost
frightened
.
``
Look
here
,
do
you
come
*NL*
from
the
other
world
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
hilt
of
his
dagger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quick
,
quick
,
''
said
the
deaf
man
,
endeavoring
to
drag
the
horse
along
;
*NL*
``
this
way
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Phoebus
dealt
him
a
vigorous
kick
in
the
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
Quasimodo
's
eye
flashed
.
He
made
a
motion
to
fling
himself
on
the
*NL*
captain
.
Then
he
drew
himself
up
stiffly
and
said
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
how
happy
you
are
to
have
some
one
who
loves
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
emphasized
the
words
``
some
one
,
''
and
loosing
the
horse
's
bridle
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Begone
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Phoebus
spurred
on
in
all
haste
,
swearing
.
Quasimodo
watched
him
*NL*
disappear
in
the
shades
of
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
said
the
poor
deaf
man
,
in
a
very
low
voice
;
``
to
refuse
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
re-entered
Notre-Dame
,
lighted
his
lamp
and
climbed
to
the
tower
*NL*
again
.
The
gypsy
was
still
in
the
same
place
,
as
he
had
supposed
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
flew
to
meet
him
as
far
off
as
she
could
see
him
.
``
Alone
!
''
she
*NL*
cried
,
clasping
her
beautiful
hands
sorrowfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
not
find
him
,
''
said
Quasimodo
coldly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
have
waited
all
night
,
''
she
said
angrily
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
saw
her
gesture
of
wrath
,
and
understood
the
reproach
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
lie
in
wait
for
him
better
another
time
,
''
he
said
,
dropping
his
*NL*
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Begone
!
''
she
said
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
left
her
.
She
was
displeased
with
him
.
He
preferred
to
have
her
*NL*
abuse
him
rather
than
to
have
afflicted
her
.
He
had
kept
all
the
pain
to
*NL*
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
that
day
forth
,
the
gypsy
no
longer
saw
him
.
He
ceased
to
come
to
*NL*
her
cell
.
At
the
most
she
occasionally
caught
a
glimpse
at
the
summit
of
*NL*
the
towers
,
of
the
bellringer
's
face
turned
sadly
to
her
.
But
as
soon
as
*NL*
she
perceived
him
,
he
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
must
admit
that
she
was
not
much
grieved
by
this
voluntary
absence
*NL*
on
the
part
of
the
poor
hunchback
.
At
the
bottom
of
her
heart
she
was
*NL*
grateful
to
him
for
it
.
Moreover
,
Quasimodo
did
not
deceive
himself
on
*NL*
this
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
no
longer
saw
him
,
but
she
felt
the
presence
of
a
good
genius
about
*NL*
her
.
Her
provisions
were
replenished
by
an
invisible
hand
during
her
*NL*
slumbers
.
One
morning
she
found
a
cage
of
birds
on
her
window
.
There
*NL*
was
a
piece
of
sculpture
above
her
window
which
frightened
her
.
She
had
*NL*
shown
this
more
than
once
in
Quasimodo
's
presence
.
One
morning
,
for
*NL*
all
these
things
happened
at
night
,
she
no
longer
saw
it
,
it
had
been
*NL*
broken
.
The
person
who
had
climbed
up
to
that
carving
must
have
risked
*NL*
his
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
,
in
the
evening
,
she
heard
a
voice
,
concealed
beneath
the
wind
*NL*
screen
of
the
bell
tower
,
singing
a
sad
,
strange
song
,
as
though
to
lull
*NL*
her
to
sleep
.
The
lines
were
unrhymed
,
such
as
a
deaf
person
can
make
.

Look
not
at
the
face
,
young
girl
,
look
at
the
heart
.
The
*NL*
heart
of
a
handsome
young
man
is
often
deformed
.
There
are
hearts
in
*NL*
which
love
does
not
keep
.
Young

,
the
pine
is
not
beautiful
;
it
is
*NL*
not
beautiful
like
the
poplar
,
but
it
keeps
its
foliage
in

Alas

What
is
the
use
of
saying
that
?
That
which
is
not
beautiful
has
no
right

to
exist

beauty
loves
only
beauty
;
April
turns
her
back

perfect
,
beauty
can
do
all
things

beauty
is
the
only
thing
*NL*
which
does
not

by

The

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
,
on
awaking
,
she
saw
on
her
window
two
vases
filled
with
*NL*
flowers
.
One
was
a
very
beautiful
and
very
brilliant
but
cracked
vase
of
*NL*
glass
.
It
had
allowed
the
water
with
which
it
had
been
filled
to
escape
,
*NL*
and
the
flowers
which
it
contained
were
withered
.
The
other
was
an
*NL*
earthenware
pot
,
coarse
and
common
,
but
which
had
preserved
all
its
*NL*
water
,
and
its
flowers
remained
fresh
and
crimson
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
know
not
whether
it
was
done
intentionally
,
but
La
Esmeralda
took
the
*NL*
faded
nosegay
and
wore
it
all
day
long
upon
her
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
day
she
did
not
hear
the
voice
singing
in
the
tower
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
troubled
herself
very
little
about
it
.
She
passed
her
days
in
*NL*
caressing
Djali
,
in
watching
the
door
of
the
Gondelaurier
house
,
in
*NL*
talking
to
herself
about
Phoebus
,
and
in
crumbling
up
her
bread
for
the
*NL*
swallows
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
entirely
ceased
to
see
or
hear
Quasimodo
.
The
poor
bellringer
*NL*
seemed
to
have
disappeared
from
the
church
.
One
night
,
nevertheless
,
*NL*
when
she
was
not
asleep
,
but
was
thinking
of
her
handsome
captain
,
she
*NL*
heard
something
breathing
near
her
cell
.
She
rose
in
alarm
,
and
saw
by
*NL*
the
light
of
the
moon
,
a
shapeless
mass
lying
across
her
door
on
the
*NL*
outside
.
It
was
Quasimodo
asleep
there
upon
the
stones

THE
KEY
TO
THE
RED
DOOR
.

In
the
meantime
,
public
minor
had
informed
the
archdeacon
of
the
*NL*
miraculous
manner
in
which
the
gypsy
had
been
saved
.
When
he
learned
it
,
*NL*
he
knew
not
what
his
sensations
were
.
He
had
reconciled
himself
to
la
*NL*
Esmeralda
's
death
.
In
that
matter
he
was
tranquil
;
he
had
reached
the
*NL*
bottom
of
personal
suffering
.
The
human
heart
-LRB-
Dora
Claude
had
meditated
*NL*
upon
these
matters
-RRB-
can
contain
only
a
certain
quantity
of
despair
.
*NL*
When
the
sponge
is
saturated
,
the
sea
may
pass
over
it
without
causing
a
*NL*
single
drop
more
to
enter
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
with
la
Esmeralda
dead
,
the
sponge
was
soaked
,
all
was
at
an
end
on
*NL*
this
earth
for
Dom
Claude
.
But
to
feel
that
she
was
alive
,
and
Phoebus
*NL*
also
,
meant
that
tortures
,
shocks
,
alternatives
,
life
,
were
beginning
*NL*
again
.
And
Claude
was
weary
of
all
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
heard
this
news
,
he
shut
himself
in
his
cell
in
the
cloister
.
He
*NL*
appeared
neither
at
the
meetings
of
the
chapter
nor
at
the
services
.
He
*NL*
closed
his
door
against
all
,
even
against
the
bishop
.
He
remained
thus
*NL*
immured
for
several
weeks
.
He
was
believed
to
be
ill
.
And
so
he
was
,
in
*NL*
fact
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
did
he
do
while
thus
shut
up
?
With
what
thoughts
was
the
*NL*
unfortunate
man
contending
?
Was
he
giving
final
battle
to
his
formidable
*NL*
passion
?
Was
he
concocting
a
final
plan
of
death
for
her
and
of
*NL*
perdition
for
himself
?
*NL*
*NL*
His
Jehan
,
his
cherished
brother
,
his
spoiled
child
,
came
once
to
his
*NL*
door
,
knocked
,
swore
,
entreated
,
gave
his
name
half
a
score
of
times
.
*NL*
Claude
did
not
open
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
passed
whole
days
with
his
face
close
to
the
panes
of
his
window
.
*NL*
From
that
window
,
situated
in
the
cloister
,
he
could
see
la
Esmeralda
's
*NL*
chamber
.
He
often
saw
herself
with
her
goat
,
sometimes
with
Quasimodo
.
*NL*
He
remarked
the
little
attentions
of
the
ugly
deaf
man
,
his
obedience
,
*NL*
his
delicate
and
submissive
ways
with
the
gypsy
.
He
recalled
,
for
he
had
*NL*
a
good
memory
,
and
memory
is
the
tormentor
of
the
jealous
,
he
recalled
*NL*
the
singular
look
of
the
bellringer
,
bent
on
the
dancer
upon
a
certain
*NL*
evening
.
He
asked
himself
what
motive
could
have
impelled
Quasimodo
to
*NL*
save
her
.
He
was
the
witness
of
a
thousand
little
scenes
between
the
*NL*
gypsy
and
the
deaf
man
,
the
pantomime
of
which
,
viewed
from
afar
and
*NL*
commented
on
by
his
passion
,
appeared
very
tender
to
him
.
He
distrusted
*NL*
the
capriciousness
of
women
.
Then
he
felt
a
jealousy
which
he
could
*NL*
never
have
believed
possible
awakening
within
him
,
a
jealousy
which
made
*NL*
him
redden
with
shame
and
indignation
:
``
One
might
condone
the
captain
,
*NL*
but
this
one
!
''
This
thought
upset
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
nights
were
frightful
.
As
soon
as
he
learned
that
the
gypsy
was
*NL*
alive
,
the
cold
ideas
of
spectre
and
tomb
which
had
persecuted
him
for
*NL*
a
whole
day
vanished
,
and
the
flesh
returned
to
goad
him
.
He
turned
and
*NL*
twisted
on
his
couch
at
the
thought
that
the
dark-skinned
maiden
was
so
*NL*
near
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
night
his
delirious
imagination
represented
la
Esmeralda
to
him
in
*NL*
all
the
attitudes
which
had
caused
his
blood
to
boil
most
.
He
beheld
her
*NL*
outstretched
upon
the
poniarded
captain
,
her
eyes
closed
,
her
beautiful
*NL*
bare
throat
covered
with
Phoebus
's
blood
,
at
that
moment
of
bliss
when
*NL*
the
archdeacon
had
imprinted
on
her
pale
lips
that
kiss
whose
burn
the
*NL*
unhappy
girl
,
though
half
dead
,
had
felt
.
He
beheld
her
,
again
,
stripped
*NL*
by
the
savage
hands
of
the
torturers
,
allowing
them
to
bare
and
to
*NL*
enclose
in
the
boot
with
its
iron
screw
,
her
tiny
foot
,
her
delicate
*NL*
rounded
leg
,
her
white
and
supple
knee
.
Again
he
beheld
that
ivory
knee
*NL*
which
alone
remained
outside
of
Torterue
's
horrible
apparatus
.
Lastly
,
*NL*
he
pictured
the
young
girl
in
her
shift
,
with
the
rope
about
her
neck
,
*NL*
shoulders
bare
,
feet
bare
,
almost
nude
,
as
he
had
seen
her
on
that
last
*NL*
day
.
These
images
of
voluptuousness
made
him
clench
his
fists
,
and
a
*NL*
shiver
run
along
his
spine
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
night
,
among
others
,
they
heated
so
cruelly
his
virgin
and
priestly
*NL*
blood
,
that
he
bit
his
pillow
,
leaped
from
his
bed
,
flung
on
a
surplice
*NL*
over
his
shirt
,
and
left
his
cell
,
lamp
in
hand
,
half
naked
,
wild
,
his
*NL*
eyes
aflame
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
knew
where
to
find
the
key
to
the
red
door
,
which
connected
the
*NL*
cloister
with
the
church
,
and
he
always
had
about
him
,
as
the
reader
*NL*
knows
,
the
key
of
the
staircase
leading
to
the
towers
.

CHAPTER
VI
.
CONTINUATION
OF
THE
KEY
TO
THE
RED
DOOR
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
That
night
,
la
Esmeralda
had
fallen
asleep
in
her
cell
,
full
of
*NL*
oblivion
,
of
hope
,
and
of
sweet
thoughts
.
She
had
already
been
asleep
*NL*
for
some
time
,
dreaming
as
always
,
of
Phoebus
,
when
it
seemed
to
her
*NL*
that
she
heard
a
noise
near
her
.
She
slept
lightly
and
uneasily
,
the
*NL*
sleep
of
a
bird
;
a
mere
nothing
waked
her
.
She
opened
her
eyes
.
The
*NL*
night
was
very
dark
.
Nevertheless
,
she
saw
a
figure
gazing
at
her
*NL*
through
the
window
;
a
lamp
lighted
up
this
apparition
.
The
moment
that
*NL*
the
figure
saw
that
la
Esmeralda
had
perceived
it
,
it
blew
out
the
*NL*
lamp
.
But
the
young
girl
had
had
time
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
it
;
her
eyes
*NL*
closed
again
with
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
she
said
in
a
faint
voice
,
``
the
priest
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
her
past
unhappiness
came
back
to
her
like
a
flash
of
lightning
.
She
*NL*
fell
back
on
her
bed
,
chilled
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
moment
later
she
felt
a
touch
along
her
body
which
made
her
shudder
*NL*
so
that
she
straightened
herself
up
in
a
sitting
posture
,
wide
awake
and
*NL*
furious
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
priest
had
just
slipped
in
beside
her
.
He
encircled
her
with
both
*NL*
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
tried
to
scream
and
could
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Begone
,
monster
!
begone
assassin
!
''
she
said
,
in
a
voice
which
was
low
*NL*
and
trembling
with
wrath
and
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mercy
!
mercy
!
''
murmured
the
priest
,
pressing
his
lips
to
her
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
seized
his
bald
head
by
its
remnant
of
hair
and
tried
to
thrust
*NL*
aside
his
kisses
as
though
they
had
been
bites
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mercy
!
''
repeated
the
unfortunate
man
.
``
If
you
but
knew
what
my
love
for
*NL*
you
is
!
'T
is
fire
,
melted
lead
,
a
thousand
daggers
in
my
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
stopped
his
two
arms
with
superhuman
force
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
go
,
''
she
said
,
``
or
I
will
spit
in
your
face
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
released
her
.
``
Vilify
me
,
strike
me
,
be
malicious
!
Do
what
you
will
!
*NL*
But
have
mercy
!
love
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
struck
him
with
the
fury
of
a
child
.
She
made
her
beautiful
*NL*
hands
stiff
to
bruise
his
face
.
``
Begone
,
demon
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Love
me
!
love
mepity
!
''
cried
the
poor
priest
returning
her
blows
with
*NL*
caresses
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
she
felt
him
stronger
than
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
must
be
an
end
to
this
!
''
he
said
,
gnashing
his
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
conquered
,
palpitating
in
his
arms
,
and
in
his
power
.
She
felt
a
*NL*
wanton
hand
straying
over
her
.
She
made
a
last
effort
,
and
began
to
cry
:
*NL*
``
Help
!
Help
!
A
vampire
!
a
vampire
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
came
.
Djali
alone
was
awake
and
bleating
with
anguish
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
!
''
said
the
panting
priest
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
,
as
she
struggled
and
crawled
on
the
floor
,
the
gypsy
's
hand
*NL*
came
in
contact
with
something
cold
and
metal-lic-it
was
Quasimodo
's
*NL*
whistle
.
She
seized
it
with
a
convulsive
hope
,
raised
it
to
her
lips
and
*NL*
blew
with
all
the
strength
that
she
had
left
.
The
whistle
gave
a
clear
,
*NL*
piercing
sound
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
that
?
''
said
the
priest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Almost
at
the
same
instant
he
felt
himself
raised
by
a
vigorous
arm
.
The
*NL*
cell
was
dark
;
he
could
not
distinguish
clearly
who
it
was
that
held
*NL*
him
thus
;
but
he
heard
teeth
chattering
with
rage
,
and
there
was
just
*NL*
sufficient
light
scattered
among
the
gloom
to
allow
him
to
see
above
his
*NL*
head
the
blade
of
a
large
knife
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
priest
fancied
that
he
perceived
the
form
of
Quasimodo
.
He
assumed
*NL*
that
it
could
be
no
one
but
he
.
He
remembered
to
have
stumbled
,
as
*NL*
he
entered
,
over
a
bundle
which
was
stretched
across
the
door
on
the
*NL*
outside
.
But
,
as
the
newcomer
did
not
utter
a
word
,
he
knew
not
what
*NL*
to
think
.
He
flung
himself
on
the
arm
which
held
the
knife
,
crying
:
*NL*
``
Quasimodo
!
''
He
forgot
,
at
that
moment
of
distress
,
that
Quasimodo
was
*NL*
deaf
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
twinkling
,
the
priest
was
overthrown
and
a
leaden
knee
rested
on
*NL*
his
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
angular
imprint
of
that
knee
he
recognized
Quasimodo
;
but
what
*NL*
was
to
be
done
?
how
could
he
make
the
other
recognize
him
?
the
darkness
*NL*
rendered
the
deaf
man
blind
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
lost
.
The
young
girl
,
pitiless
as
an
enraged
tigress
,
did
not
*NL*
intervene
to
save
him
.
The
knife
was
approaching
his
head
;
the
*NL*
moment
was
critical
.
All
at
once
,
his
adversary
seemed
stricken
with
*NL*
hesitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
blood
on
her
!
''
he
said
in
a
dull
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
,
in
fact
,
Quasimodo
's
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
priest
felt
a
large
hand
dragging
him
feet
first
out
of
the
*NL*
cell
;
it
was
there
that
he
was
to
die
.
Fortunately
for
him
,
the
moon
had
*NL*
risen
a
few
moments
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
had
passed
through
the
door
of
the
cell
,
its
pale
rays
fell
*NL*
upon
the
priest
's
countenance
.
Quasimodo
looked
him
full
in
the
face
,
a
*NL*
trembling
seized
him
,
and
he
released
the
priest
and
shrank
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gypsy
,
who
had
advanced
to
the
threshold
of
her
cell
,
beheld
*NL*
with
surprise
their
roles
abruptly
changed
.
It
was
now
the
priest
who
*NL*
menaced
,
Quasimodo
who
was
the
suppliant
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
priest
,
who
was
overwhelming
the
deaf
man
with
gestures
of
wrath
and
*NL*
reproach
,
made
the
latter
a
violent
sign
to
retire
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
deaf
man
dropped
his
head
,
then
he
came
and
knelt
at
the
gypsy
's
*NL*
door
,
--
``
Monseigneur
,
''
he
said
,
in
a
grave
and
resigned
voice
,
``
you
shall
*NL*
do
all
that
you
please
afterwards
,
but
kill
me
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
he
presented
his
knife
to
the
priest
.
The
priest
,
beside
*NL*
himself
,
was
about
to
seize
it
.
But
the
young
girl
was
quicker
than
be
;
*NL*
she
wrenched
the
knife
from
Quasimodo
's
hands
and
burst
into
a
frantic
*NL*
laugh
,
--
``
Approach
,
''
she
said
to
the
priest
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
held
the
blade
high
.
The
priest
remained
undecided
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
would
certainly
have
struck
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
added
with
a
pitiless
expression
,
well
aware
that
she
was
about
*NL*
to
pierce
the
priest
's
heart
with
thousands
of
red-hot
irons
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
I
know
that
Phoebus
is
not
dead
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
priest
overturned
Quasimodo
on
the
floor
with
a
kick
,
and
,
quivering
*NL*
with
rage
,
darted
back
under
the
vault
of
the
staircase
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
was
gone
,
Quasimodo
picked
up
the
whistle
which
had
just
saved
*NL*
the
gypsy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
getting
rusty
,
''
he
said
,
as
he
handed
it
back
to
her
;
then
he
*NL*
left
her
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
girl
,
deeply
agitated
by
this
violent
scene
,
fell
back
*NL*
exhausted
on
her
bed
,
and
began
to
sob
and
weep
.
Her
horizon
was
*NL*
becoming
gloomy
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
priest
had
groped
his
way
back
to
his
cell
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
settled
.
Dom
Claude
was
jealous
of
Quasimodo
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
repeated
with
a
thoughtful
air
his
fatal
words
:
``
No
one
shall
have
*NL*
her
.

CHAPTER
I.
GRINGOIRE
HAS
MANY
GOOD
IDEAS
IN
SUCCESSION
.
--
RUE
DES
*NL*
BERNARDINS
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
Pierre
Gringoire
had
seen
how
this
whole
affair
was
*NL*
turning
,
and
that
there
would
decidedly
be
the
rope
,
hanging
,
and
other
*NL*
disagreeable
things
for
the
principal
personages
in
this
comedy
,
he
had
*NL*
not
cared
to
identify
himself
with
the
matter
further
.
The
outcasts
*NL*
with
whom
he
had
remained
,
reflecting
that
,
after
all
,
it
was
the
best
*NL*
company
in
Paris
,
--
the
outcasts
had
continued
to
interest
themselves
in
*NL*
behalf
of
the
gypsy
.
He
had
thought
it
very
simple
on
the
part
of
*NL*
people
who
had
,
like
herself
,
nothing
else
in
prospect
but
Charmolue
and
*NL*
Torterue
,
and
who
,
unlike
himself
,
did
not
gallop
through
the
regions
*NL*
of
imagination
between
the
wings
of
Pegasus
.
From
their
remarks
,
he
*NL*
had
learned
that
his
wife
of
the
broken
crock
had
taken
refuge
in
*NL*
Notre-Dame
,
and
he
was
very
glad
of
it
.
But
he
felt
no
temptation
to
*NL*
go
and
see
her
there
.
He
meditated
occasionally
on
the
little
goat
,
and
*NL*
that
was
all
.
Moreover
,
he
was
busy
executing
feats
of
strength
during
*NL*
the
day
for
his
living
,
and
at
night
he
was
engaged
in
composing
a
*NL*
memorial
against
the
Bishop
of
Paris
,
for
he
remembered
having
been
*NL*
drenched
by
the
wheels
of
his
mills
,
and
he
cherished
a
grudge
against
*NL*
him
for
it
.
He
also
occupied
himself
with
annotating
the
fine
work
of
*NL*
Baudry-le-Rouge
,
Bishop
of
Noyon
and
Tournay
,
_
De
Cupa
Petrarum
_
,
which
*NL*
had
given
him
a
violent
passion
for
architecture
,
an
inclination
which
*NL*
had
replaced
in
his
heart
his
passion
for
hermeticism
,
of
which
it
was
,
*NL*
moreover
,
only
a
natural
corollary
,
since
there
is
an
intimate
relation
*NL*
between
hermeticism
and
masonry
.
Gringoire
had
passed
from
the
love
of
*NL*
an
idea
to
the
love
of
the
form
of
that
idea
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
he
had
halted
near
Saint
Germain-l'Auxerrois
,
at
the
corner
of
*NL*
a
mansion
called
``
For-l'Eveque
''
-LRB-
the
Bishop
's
Tribunal
-RRB-
,
which
stood
*NL*
opposite
another
called
``
For-le-Roi
''
-LRB-
the
King
's
Tribunal
-RRB-
.
At
this
*NL*
For-l'Eveque
,
there
was
a
charming
chapel
of
the
fourteenth
century
,
*NL*
whose
apse
was
on
the
street
.
Gringoire
was
devoutly
examining
its
*NL*
exterior
sculptures
.
He
was
in
one
of
those
moments
of
egotistical
,
*NL*
exclusive
,
supreme
,
enjoyment
when
the
artist
beholds
nothing
in
the
*NL*
world
but
art
,
and
the
world
in
art
.
All
at
once
he
feels
a
hand
laid
*NL*
gravely
on
his
shoulder
.
He
turns
round
.
It
was
his
old
friend
,
his
*NL*
former
master
,
monsieur
the
archdeacon
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
stupefied
.
It
was
a
long
time
since
he
had
seen
the
archdeacon
,
*NL*
and
Dom
Claude
was
one
of
those
solemn
and
impassioned
men
,
a
meeting
*NL*
with
whom
always
upsets
the
equilibrium
of
a
sceptical
philosopher
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
archdeacon
maintained
silence
for
several
minutes
,
during
which
*NL*
Gringoire
had
time
to
observe
him
.
He
found
Dom
Claude
greatly
changed
;
*NL*
pale
as
a
winter
's
morning
,
with
hollow
eyes
,
and
hair
almost
white
.
The
*NL*
priest
broke
the
silence
at
length
,
by
saying
,
in
a
tranquil
but
glacial
*NL*
tone
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
do
,
Master
Pierre
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
health
?
''
replied
Gringoire
.
``
Eh
!
eh
!
one
can
say
both
one
thing
and
*NL*
another
on
that
score
.
Still
,
it
is
good
,
on
the
whole
.
I
take
not
too
*NL*
much
of
anything
.
You
know
,
master
,
that
the
secret
of
keeping
well
,
*NL*
according
to
Hippocrates
;
_
id
est
:
cibi
,
potus
,
somni
,
venus
,
omnia
*NL*
moderata
sint
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
have
no
care
,
Master
Pierre
?
''
resumed
the
archdeacon
,
gazing
*NL*
intently
at
Gringoire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
None
,
i
'
faith
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
are
you
doing
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
master
.
I
am
examining
the
chiselling
of
these
stones
,
and
the
*NL*
manner
in
which
yonder
bas-relief
is
thrown
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
priest
began
to
smile
with
that
bitter
smile
which
raises
only
one
*NL*
corner
of
the
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
amuses
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
paradise
!
''
exclaimed
Gringoire
.
And
leaning
over
the
sculptures
*NL*
with
the
fascinated
air
of
a
demonstrator
of
living
phenomena
:
``
Do
*NL*
you
not
think
,
for
instance
,
that
yon
metamorphosis
in
bas-relief
is
*NL*
executed
with
much
adroitness
,
delicacy
and
patience
?
Observe
that
*NL*
slender
column
.
Around
what
capital
have
you
seen
foliage
more
tender
*NL*
and
better
caressed
by
the
chisel
.
Here
are
three
raised
bosses
of
*NL*
Jean
Maillevin
.
They
are
not
the
finest
works
of
this
great
master
.
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
the
naivete
,
the
sweetness
of
the
faces
,
the
gayety
of
the
*NL*
attitudes
and
draperies
,
and
that
inexplicable
charm
which
is
mingled
*NL*
with
all
the
defects
,
render
the
little
figures
very
diverting
and
*NL*
delicate
,
perchance
,
even
too
much
so
.
You
think
that
it
is
not
*NL*
diverting
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
certainly
!
''
said
the
priest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
if
you
were
to
see
the
interior
of
the
chapel
!
''
resumed
the
poet
,
*NL*
with
his
garrulous
enthusiasm
.
``
Carvings
everywhere
.
'T
is
as
thickly
*NL*
clustered
as
the
head
of
a
cabbage
!
The
apse
is
of
a
very
devout
,
and
so
*NL*
peculiar
a
fashion
that
I
have
never
beheld
anything
like
it
elsewhere
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dom
Claude
interrupted
him
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
happy
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gringoire
replied
warmly
;
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
my
honor
,
yes
!
First
I
loved
women
,
then
animals
.
Now
I
love
stones
.
*NL*
They
are
quite
as
amusing
as
women
and
animals
,
and
less
treacherous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
priest
laid
his
hand
on
his
brow
.
It
was
his
habitual
gesture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
!
''
said
Gringoire
,
``
one
has
one
's
pleasures
!
''
He
took
the
arm
of
*NL*
the
priest
,
who
let
him
have
his
way
,
and
made
him
enter
the
staircase
*NL*
turret
of
For-l'Eveque
.
``
Here
is
a
staircase
!
every
time
that
I
see
it
I
*NL*
am
happy
.
It
is
of
the
simplest
and
rarest
manner
of
steps
in
Paris
.
All
*NL*
the
steps
are
bevelled
underneath
.
Its
beauty
and
simplicity
consist
*NL*
in
the
interspacing
of
both
,
being
a
foot
or
more
wide
,
which
are
*NL*
interlaced
,
interlocked
,
fitted
together
,
enchained
enchased
,
interlined
*NL*
one
upon
another
,
and
bite
into
each
other
in
a
manner
that
is
truly
*NL*
firm
and
graceful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
desire
nothing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
regret
nothing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Neither
regret
nor
desire
.
I
have
arranged
my
mode
of
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
men
arrange
,
''
said
Claude
,
``
things
disarrange
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
a
Pyrrhonian
philosopher
,
''
replied
Gringoire
,
``
and
I
hold
all
*NL*
things
in
equilibrium
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
do
you
earn
your
living
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
still
make
epics
and
tragedies
now
and
then
;
but
that
which
brings
me
*NL*
in
most
is
the
industry
with
which
you
are
acquainted
,
master
;
carrying
*NL*
pyramids
of
chairs
in
my
teeth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
trade
is
but
a
rough
one
for
a
philosopher
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
still
equilibrium
,
''
said
Gringoire
.
``
When
one
has
an
idea
,
one
*NL*
encounters
it
in
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
that
,
''
replied
the
archdeacon
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
silence
,
the
priest
resumed
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
,
nevertheless
,
tolerably
poor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
,
yes
;
unhappy
,
no
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
,
a
trampling
of
horses
was
heard
,
and
our
two
*NL*
interlocutors
beheld
defiling
at
the
end
of
the
street
,
a
company
of
the
*NL*
king
's
unattached
archers
,
their
lances
borne
high
,
an
officer
at
*NL*
their
head
.
The
cavalcade
was
brilliant
,
and
its
march
resounded
on
the
*NL*
pavement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
you
gaze
at
that
officer
!
''
said
Gringoire
,
to
the
archdeacon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
think
I
recognize
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
call
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
,
''
said
Claude
,
``
that
his
name
is
Phoebus
de
Chateaupers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Phoebus
!
A
curious
name
!
There
is
also
a
Phoebus
,
Comte
de
Foix
.
I
*NL*
remember
having
known
a
wench
who
swore
only
by
the
name
of
Phoebus
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
away
from
here
,
''
said
the
priest
.
``
I
have
something
to
say
to
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
moment
of
that
troop
's
passing
,
some
agitation
had
pierced
*NL*
through
the
archdeacon
's
glacial
envelope
.
He
walked
on
.
Gringoire
*NL*
followed
him
,
being
accustomed
to
obey
him
,
like
all
who
had
once
*NL*
approached
that
man
so
full
of
ascendency
.
They
reached
in
silence
the
*NL*
Rue
des
Bernardins
,
which
was
nearly
deserted
.
Here
Dom
Claude
paused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
you
to
say
to
me
,
master
?
''
Gringoire
asked
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
not
think
that
the
dress
of
those
cavaliers
whom
we
have
just
*NL*
seen
is
far
handsomer
than
yours
and
mine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gringoire
tossed
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'
faith
!
I
love
better
my
red
and
yellow
jerkin
,
than
those
scales
*NL*
of
iron
and
steel
.
A
fine
pleasure
to
produce
,
when
you
walk
,
the
same
*NL*
noise
as
the
Quay
of
Old
Iron
,
in
an
earthquake
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
Gringoire
,
you
have
never
cherished
envy
for
those
handsome
fellows
*NL*
in
their
military
doublets
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Envy
for
what
,
monsieur
the
archdeacon
?
their
strength
,
their
armor
,
*NL*
their
discipline
?
Better
philosophy
and
independence
in
rags
.
I
prefer
*NL*
to
be
the
head
of
a
fly
rather
than
the
tail
of
a
lion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
singular
,
''
said
the
priest
dreamily
.
``
Yet
a
handsome
uniform
is
*NL*
a
beautiful
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gringoire
,
perceiving
that
he
was
in
a
pensive
mood
,
quitted
him
to
go
*NL*
and
admire
the
porch
of
a
neighboring
house
.
He
came
back
clapping
his
*NL*
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
were
less
engrossed
with
the
fine
clothes
of
men
of
war
,
*NL*
monsieur
the
archdeacon
,
I
would
entreat
you
to
come
and
see
this
door
.
*NL*
I
have
always
said
that
the
house
of
the
Sieur
Aubry
had
the
most
superb
*NL*
entrance
in
the
world
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Pierre
Gringoire

said
the
archdeacon

What
have
you
done

*NL*
little
gypsy
dancer

``
La

change
the
conversation
very
abruptly

Was

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

four
years

the
way

added
Gringoire
,
looking
at
the
archdeacon
in
a
half
bantering
*NL*
way
,
``
are

still
thinking

her

And
you

no

*NL*
*NL*
``
Very

so
many

Good

little
goat

You

``
I

When
I

Wait

that

was
safe
there

I
am
delighted
to
hear
it

I
have
not

been
able
to
discover
whether

all

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
tell
you
more

cried
Dom
Claude
;
and
his
voice
,
hitherto
low
,
*NL*
slow
,
and
almost
indistinct
,
turned
to
thunder
.
``
She
has
in
fact

taken

refuge

But
in
three
days
justice
will
reclaim
her

and
*NL*
she
will
be
hanged
on
the
Greve

There
is
a
decree
of
parliament

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
annoying

said
Gringoire
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
priest
,
in
an
instant
,
became
cold
and
calm
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
the
devil
,
''
resumed
the
poet
,
``
has
amused
himself
with
*NL*
soliciting
a
decree

reintegration

Why
could

they
leave
parliament

What
harm
does
it
do
if
a
poor
girl
takes
shelter
under
the
*NL*
flying
buttresses
of
Notre-Dame
,
beside
the
swallows

nests

*NL*
*NL*
``
There

remarked
the
archdeacon
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
devilish
badly
done

observed
Gringoire
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
archdeacon
resumed
after
a
silence
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
she
saved
your
life

*NL*
*NL*
``
Among

*NL*
*NL*
The
priest
smote
his
brow
.
In
spite
of
the
calm
which
he
affected
,
a
*NL*
violent
gesture
betrayed
his
internal
convulsions
from
time
to
time

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
she
to

Gringoire
said
to
him
;

I
will
reply

Claude
dreamily

Gringoire
smote
his

in
his
turn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
master

I
have
imagination

This
made
the

hollow
eye
flash
.

*NL*
``
With

know
anything

*NL*
Gringoire
was
alarmed
by
his
air
.
He
hastened
to
say
,
``
Oh
,
no

not
I

*NL*
Our

a

Gringoire

*NL*
The

was
not
listening
to
him

*NL*

she

leave

he
murmured
,
``

Moreover

He
raised
his
voice
:
*NL*
``
Master
Pierre

I
have
reflected
well

there
is

one
means

*NL*
``
What
?
I
see
none

tell

frankly

watched
night

come
out

I

her

You

change

She

take
your

take
her

*NL*
*NL*
``
So
far

it
goes
well

the
philosopher

then

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then

she

go
forth

*NL*
*NL*
Gringoire
scratched
his
ear
,
with
a
very
serious
air
.
``
Stay
!
''
said
he
,
*NL*
``
that
is
an
idea

never
have
occurred

*NL*
*NL*
At
Dom
Claude
's
proposition
,
the
open
and
benign
face
of
the
poet
had
*NL*
abruptly
clouded
over
,
like
a
smiling
Italian
landscape
,
when
an
unlucky
*NL*
squall
comes
up
and
dashes
a
cloud
across
the
sun

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

Gringoire

you

*NL*
*NL*

I

Gringoire

The

spoke
imperiously

*NL*
``

replied
the
poet
in
utter
consternation

*NL*
*NL*
``
What

three
great
books

Anaxagoras
said
that

have
the
happiness

all

*NL*
*NL*
``
A

muttered
the
archdeacon
.
``
Oh

preserved
for

do
you
owe
it
that
you
breathe

air

behold
that
sky

and
can
*NL*
still
amuse
your
lark

mind
with
your
whimsical
nonsense

madness

*NL*
Where
would
you
be

not

Do
you
then
desire
that

alive

that
she

*NL*
*NL*
The
priest
was
vehement
.
Gringoire
listened
to
him
at
first
with
an
*NL*
undecided
air
,
then
he
became
touched
,
and
wound
up
with
a
grimace
which
*NL*
made
his
pallid
face
resemble
that
of
a
new-born
infant
with
an
attack
*NL*
of
the
colic
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
pathetic
!

said
he
,
wiping
away
a
tear
.
``
Well

I
will
think
*NL*
about
it

That
's
a
queer
idea

yours

After
all

he
continued
after
*NL*
a
pause
,
``
who
knows

perhaps
they

not

lodging
so
grotesquely
muffled
in
petticoat

coif

perchance
they

will
burst
with
laughter

And
then
,
if
they
do
hang
me
,
--
well

the
*NL*
halter
is
as
good
a
death
as
any

'T
is
a
death
worthy
of
a
sage

has
*NL*
wavered
all
his
life
;
a
death
which
is
neither
flesh
nor
fish
,
like
the
*NL*
mind
of
a
veritable
sceptic
;
a
death
all
stamped
with
Pyrrhonism
and
*NL*
hesitation
,
which
holds
the
middle
station
betwixt
heaven

earth

leaves
you
in
suspense

a

magnificent

The
priest
interrupted
him
:
``
Is
it
agreed

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
death

pursued
Gringoire
with
exaltation

``
A

the
Megalopolitan

if

were
willing

he

gave

his
hand

come

to-morrow

gesture
recalled
Gringoire
to
reality

*NL*
``
Ah

said
in

tone

``
Farewell

added
between

*NL*
``
I
do
not

Gringoire

ran
after
Dom
Claude

The

tore
out
the
buttons
of
his
cassock
with
impatience

Stream

of
words

What
is
your

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

resumed
Gringoire

talking
to
himself

touching
his
nose
with

his
forefinger
in
sign
of
meditation

the

shaking
him

Gringoire
turned
majestically
towards
him
:

Leave

You
see
that

He
meditated
for
a
few
moments
more

began
to
clap
his

hands
over
his
thought

crying
:

off

Gringoire
bent
his
head
to
the

head
and
spoke
to
him
in

very
low
voice

casting
an
uneasy
glance
the
while
from
one
end
to
the

other
of
the
street

no

When

finished

Dom

took
his

coldly

And

while
the
archdeacon
was

disappearing
in
one
direction

he
set
off
in

to

low
voice

a

Never

'T
is
not
written
that
because
one

of
small

account
one
should
take
fright

CHAPTER
II

TURN
VAGABOND
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
On
re-entering
the
cloister
,
the
archdeacon
found
at
the
door
of
his
*NL*
cell
his
brother
Jehan
du
Moulin
,
who
was
waiting
for
him
,
and
who
had
*NL*
beguiled
the
tedium
of
waiting
by
drawing
on
the
wall
with
a
bit
of
*NL*
charcoal
,
a
profile
of
his
elder
brother
,
enriched
with
a
monstrous
*NL*
nose
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dom
Claude
hardly
looked
at
his
brother
;
his
thoughts
were
elsewhere
.
*NL*
That
merry
scamp
's
face
whose
beaming
had
so
often
restored
serenity
*NL*
to
the
priest
's
sombre
physiognomy
,
was
now
powerless
to
melt
the
gloom
*NL*
which
grew
more
dense
every
day
over
that
corrupted
,
mephitic
,
and
*NL*
stagnant
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brother
,
''
said
Jehan
timidly
,
``
I
am
come
to
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
archdeacon
did
not
even
raise
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brother
,
''
resumed
the
hypocrite
,
``
you
are
so
good
to
me
,
and
you
give
*NL*
me
such
wise
counsels
that
I
always
return
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
next
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
!
brother
,
you
were
perfectly
right
when
you
said
to
me

Jehan

not
the
night
outside
of
the
*NL*
college
without

occasion
and
due
leave

every
evening
to
chapel
,
and
sing
there
an
anthem
*NL*
with
verse
and
orison
to
Madame
the
glorious
Virgin
Mary
.
''
--
Alas
!
what
*NL*
excellent
advice
was
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brother
,
you
behold
a
culprit
,
a
criminal
,
a
wretch
,
a
libertine
,
a
man
*NL*
of
enormities
!
My
dear
brother
,
Jehan
hath
made
of
your
counsels
straw
*NL*
and
dung
to
trample
under
foot
.
I
have
been
well
chastised
for
it
,
and
*NL*
God
is
extraordinarily
just
.
As
long
as
I
had
money
,
I
feasted
,
I
lead
a
*NL*
mad
and
joyous
life
.
Oh
!
how
ugly
and
crabbed
behind
is
debauch
which
*NL*
is
so
charming
in
front
!
Now
I
have
no
longer
a
blank
;
I
have
sold
my
*NL*
napery
,
my
shirt
and
my
towels
;
no
more
merry
life
!
The
beautiful
candle
*NL*
is
extinguished
and
I
have
henceforth
,
only
a
wretched
tallow
dip
*NL*
which
smokes
in
my
nose
.
The
wenches
jeer
at
me
.
I
drink
water
.
--
I
am
*NL*
overwhelmed
with
remorse
and
with
creditors
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
rest
?
''
said
the
archdeacon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
!
my
very
dear
brother
,
I
should
like
to
settle
down
to
a
better
*NL*
life
.
I
come
to
you
full
of
contrition
,
I
am
penitent
.
I
make
my
*NL*
confession
.
I
beat
my
breast
violently
.
You
are
quite
right
in
wishing
*NL*
that
I
should
some
day
become
a
licentiate
and
sub-monitor
in
the
*NL*
college
of
Torchi
.
At
the
present
moment
I
feel
a
magnificent
vocation
*NL*
for
that
profession
.
But
I
have
no
more
ink
and
I
must
buy
some
;
I
*NL*
have
no
more
paper
,
I
have
no
more
books
,
and
I
must
buy
some
.
For
this
*NL*
purpose
,
I
am
greatly
in
need
of
a
little
money
,
and
I
come
to
you
,
*NL*
brother
,
with
my
heart
full
of
contrition
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
the
scholar
.
``
A
little
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
none
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
scholar
said
,
with
an
air
which
was
both
grave
and
resolute
:
*NL*
``
Well
,
brother
,
I
am
sorry
to
be
obliged
to
tell
you
that
very
fine
*NL*
offers
and
propositions
are
being
made
to
me
in
another
quarter
.
*NL*
You
will
not
give
me
any
money
?
No
.
In
that
case
I
shall
become
a
*NL*
professional
vagabond
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
uttered
these
monstrous
words
,
he
assumed
the
mien
of
Ajax
,
*NL*
expecting
to
see
the
lightnings
descend
upon
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
archdeacon
said
coldly
to
him
,
--
``
Become
a
vagabond
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jehan
made
him
a
deep
bow
,
and
descended
the
cloister
stairs
,
whistling
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
moment
when
he
was
passing
through
the
courtyard
of
the
cloister
,
*NL*
beneath
his
brother
's
window
,
he
heard
that
window
open
,
raised
his
eyes
*NL*
and
beheld
the
archdeacon
's
severe
head
emerge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
to
the
devil
!
''
said
Dom
Claude
;
``
here
is
the
last
money
which
you
*NL*
will
get
from
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
time
,
the
priest
flung
Jehan
a
purse
,
which
gave
the
scholar
*NL*
a
big
bump
on
the
forehead
,
and
with
which
Jehan
retreated
,
both
vexed
*NL*
and
content
,
like
a
dog
who
had
been
stoned
with
marrow
bones
.

CHAPTER
III
.
LONG
LIVE
MIRTH
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
has
probably
not
forgotten
that
a
part
of
the
Cour
de
*NL*
Miracles
was
enclosed
by
the
ancient
wall
which
surrounded
the
city
,
a
*NL*
goodly
number
of
whose
towers
had
begun
,
even
at
that
epoch
,
to
fall
to
*NL*
ruin
.
One
of
these
towers
had
been
converted
into
a
pleasure
resort
by
*NL*
the
vagabonds
.
There
was
a
drain-shop
in
the
underground
story
,
and
the
*NL*
rest
in
the
upper
stories
.
This
was
the
most
lively
,
and
consequently
*NL*
the
most
hideous
,
point
of
the
whole
outcast
den
.
It
was
a
sort
of
*NL*
monstrous
hive
,
which
buzzed
there
night
and
day
.
At
night
,
when
the
*NL*
remainder
of
the
beggar
horde
slept
,
when
there
was
no
longer
a
window
*NL*
lighted
in
the
dingy
facades
of
the
Place
,
when
not
a
cry
was
any
longer
*NL*
to
be
heard
proceeding
from
those
innumerable
families
,
those
ant-hills
*NL*
of
thieves
,
of
wenches
,
and
stolen
or
bastard
children
,
the
merry
tower
*NL*
was
still
recognizable
by
the
noise
which
it
made
,
by
the
scarlet
light
*NL*
which
,
flashing
simultaneously
from
the
air-holes
,
the
windows
,
the
*NL*
fissures
in
the
cracked
walls
,
escaped
,
so
to
speak
,
from
its
every
*NL*
pore
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cellar
then
,
was
the
dram-shop
.
The
descent
to
it
was
through
a
*NL*
low
door
and
by
a
staircase
as
steep
as
a
classic
Alexandrine
.
Over
the
*NL*
door
,
by
way
of
a
sign
there
hung
a
marvellous
daub
,
representing
new
*NL*
sons
and
dead
chickens
,
*
with
this
,
pun
below
:
_
Aux
sonneurs
pour
les
*NL*
trepasses

,

The
wringers
for
the
dead

*NL*
One
evening
when
the
curfew
was
sounding
from
all
the
belfries
in
Paris
,
*NL*
the
sergeants
of
the
watch
might
have
observed
,
had
it
been
granted
to
*NL*
them
to
enter
the
formidable
Court
of
Miracles
,
that
more
tumult
than
*NL*
usual
was
in
progress
in
the
vagabonds
'
tavern
,
that
more
drinking
was
*NL*
being
done
,
and
louder
swearing
.
Outside
in
the
Place
,
there
,
were
many
*NL*
groups
conversing
in
low
tones
,
as
when
some
great
plan
is
being
framed
,
*NL*
and
here
and
there
a
knave
crouching
down
engaged
in
sharpening
a
*NL*
villanous
iron
blade
on
a
paving-stone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
in
the
tavern
itself
,
wine
and
gaming
offered
such
a
powerful
*NL*
diversion
to
the
ideas
which
occupied
the
vagabonds
'
lair
that
evening
,
*NL*
that
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
divine
from
the
remarks
of
the
*NL*
drinkers
,
what
was
the
matter
in
hand
.
They
merely
wore
a
gayer
air
than
*NL*
was
their
wont
,
and
some
weapon
could
be
seen
glittering
between
the
*NL*
legs
of
each
of
them
,
--
a
sickle
,
an
axe
,
a
big
two-edged
sword
or
the
*NL*
hook
of
an
old
hackbut
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
room
,
circular
in
form
,
was
very
spacious
;
but
the
tables
were
*NL*
so
thickly
set
and
the
drinkers
so
numerous
,
that
all
that
the
tavern
*NL*
contained
,
men
,
women
,
benches
,
beer-jugs
,
all
that
were
drinking
,
all
*NL*
that
were
sleeping
,
all
that
were
playing
,
the
well
,
the
lame
,
seemed
*NL*
piled
up
pell-mell
,
with
as
much
order
and
harmony
as
a
heap
of
oyster
*NL*
shells
.
There
were
a
few
tallow
dips
lighted
on
the
tables
;
but
the
real
*NL*
luminary
of
this
tavern
,
that
which
played
the
part
in
this
dram-shop
of
*NL*
the
chandelier
of
an
opera
house
,
was
the
fire
.
This
cellar
was
so
damp
*NL*
that
the
fire
was
never
allowed
to
go
out
,
even
in
midsummer
;
an
immense
*NL*
chimney
with
a
sculptured
mantel
,
all
bristling
with
heavy
iron
andirons
*NL*
and
cooking
utensils
,
with
one
of
those
huge
fires
of
mixed
wood
and
*NL*
peat
which
at
night
,
in
village
streets
make
the
reflection
of
forge
*NL*
windows
stand
out
so
red
on
the
opposite
walls
.
A
big
dog
gravely
seated
*NL*
in
the
ashes
was
turning
a
spit
loaded
with
meat
before
the
coals
.
*NL*
*NL*
Great
as
was
the
confusion
,
after
the
first
glance
one
could
distinguish
*NL*
in
that
multitude
,
three
principal
groups
which
thronged
around
three
*NL*
personages
already
known
to
the
reader
.
One
of
these
personages
,
*NL*
fantastically
accoutred
in
many
an
oriental
rag
,
was
Mathias
Hungadi
*NL*
Spicali
,
Duke
of
Egypt
and
Bohemia
.
The
knave
was
seated
on
a
table
with
*NL*
his
legs
crossed
,
and
in
a
loud
voice
was
bestowing
his
knowledge
of
*NL*
magic
,
both
black
and
white
,
on
many
a
gaping
face
which
surrounded
him
.
*NL*
Another
rabble
pressed
close
around
our
old
friend
,
the
valiant
King
of
*NL*
Thunes
,
armed
to
the
teeth
.
Clopin
Trouillefou
,
with
a
very
serious
air
*NL*
and
in
a
low
voice
,
was
regulating
the
distribution
of
an
enormous
cask
*NL*
of
arms
,
which
stood
wide
open
in
front
of
him
and
from
whence
poured
*NL*
out
in
profusion
,
axes
,
swords
,
bassinets
,
coats
of
mail
,
broadswords
,
*NL*
lance-heads
,
arrows
,
and
viretons
,
*
like
apples
and
grapes
from
a
horn
*NL*
of
plenty
.
Every
one
took
something
from
the
cask
,
one
a
morion
,
another
*NL*
a
long
,
straight
sword
,
another
a
dagger
with
a
cross
--
shaped
hilt
.
The
*NL*
very
children
were
arming
themselves
,
and
there
were
even
cripples
in
*NL*
bowls
who
,
in
armor
and
cuirass
,
made
their
way
between
the
legs
of
the
*NL*
drinkers
,
like
great
beetles
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
An
arrow
with
a
pyramidal
head
of
iron
and
copper
spiral
*NL*
wings
,
by
which
a
rotatory
motion
was
communicated
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Finally
,
a
third
audience
,
the
most
noisy
,
the
most
jovial
,
and
the
most
*NL*
numerous
,
encumbered
benches
and
tables
,
in
the
midst
of
which
harangued
*NL*
and
swore
a
flute-like
voice
,
which
escaped
from
beneath
a
heavy
armor
,
*NL*
complete
from
casque
to
spurs
.
The
individual
who
had
thus
screwed
a
*NL*
whole
outfit
upon
his
body
,
was
so
hidden
by
his
warlike
accoutrements
*NL*
that
nothing
was
to
be
seen
of
his
person
save
an
impertinent
,
red
,
*NL*
snub
nose
,
a
rosy
mouth
,
and
bold
eyes
.
His
belt
was
full
of
daggers
and
*NL*
poniards
,
a
huge
sword
on
his
hip
,
a
rusted
cross-bow
at
his
left
,
and
a
*NL*
vast
jug
of
wine
in
front
of
him
,
without
reckoning
on
his
right
,
a
fat
*NL*
wench
with
her
bosom
uncovered
.
All
mouths
around
him
were
laughing
,
*NL*
cursing
,
and
drinking
.
*NL*
*NL*
Add
twenty
secondary
groups
,
the
waiters
,
male
and
female
,
running
with
*NL*
jugs
on
their
heads
,
gamblers
squatting
over
taws
,
merelles
,
*
dice
,
*NL*
vachettes
,
the
ardent
game
of
tringlet
,
quarrels
in
one
corner
,
kisses
*NL*
in
another
,
and
the
reader
will
have
some
idea
of
this
whole
picture
,
*NL*
over
which
flickered
the
light
of
a
great
,
flaming
fire
,
which
made
a
*NL*
thousand
huge
and
grotesque
shadows
dance
over
the
walls
of
the
drinking
*NL*
shop
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
A
game
played
on
a
checker-board
containing
three
concentric
*NL*
sets
of
squares
,
with
small
stones
.
The
game
consisted
in
getting
three
*NL*
stones
in
a
row
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
the
noise
,
it
was
like
the
inside
of
a
bell
at
full
peal
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dripping-pan
,
where
crackled
a
rain
of
grease
,
filled
with
its
*NL*
continual
sputtering
the
intervals
of
these
thousand
dialogues
,
which
*NL*
intermingled
from
one
end
of
the
apartment
to
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
midst
of
this
uproar
,
at
the
extremity
of
the
tavern
,
on
the
*NL*
bench
inside
the
chimney
,
sat
a
philosopher
meditating
with
his
feet
in
*NL*
the
ashes
and
his
eyes
on
the
brands
.
It
was
Pierre
Gringoire
.

the

dominated
the

all

Our

plunder

that

We

Do

I

gang
in

I
was
born
an
independent
thief

I
have
been
rich

I
have
*NL*
devoured
all

My

wanted

I

made

I
said
this
to
my

spit
his

in

to

who
set
to

Meanwhile

the
rabble
applauded
with
shouts
of
laughter
;
and
seeing
that
*NL*
the
tumult
was
increasing
around
him
,
the
scholar
cried
,

``

Then
he
began
to
sing

his
eye
swimming
in
ecstasy

in
the
tone
of

intoning

broke

off

*NL*
There
was
a
moment
of
partial
silence
,
during
which
the
sharp
voice
of
*NL*
the
Duke

rose
,
as
he
gave

Meanwhile

continued
to

whisper
at

they
served
Jehan
with

As

threw
himself
back
on

Ten
minutes
later
,
the
cavaliers
of
the
watch
fled
in
terror
before
a
*NL*
long
procession
of
black
and
silent
men
which
was
descending
towards
*NL*
the
Pont
an
Change
,
through
the
tortuous
streets
which
pierce
the

close-built
neighborhood
of

markets

CHAPTER
IV
.
AN
AWKWARD
FRIEND
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
That
night
,
Quasimodo
did
not
sleep
.
He
had
just
made
his
last
round
of
*NL*
the
church
.
He
had
not
noticed
,
that
at
the
moment
when
he
was
closing
*NL*
the
doors
,
the
archdeacon
had
passed
close
to
him
and
betrayed
some
*NL*
displeasure
on
seeing
him
bolting
and
barring
with
care
the
enormous
*NL*
iron
locks
which
gave
to
their
large
leaves
the
solidity
of
a
wall
.
Dom
*NL*
Claude
's
air
was
even
more
preoccupied
than
usual
.
Moreover
,
since
the
*NL*
nocturnal
adventure
in
the
cell
,
he
had
constantly
abused
Quasimodo
,
*NL*
but
in
vain
did
he
ill
treat
,
and
even
beat
him
occasionally
,
nothing
*NL*
disturbed
the
submission
,
patience
,
the
devoted
resignation
of
*NL*
the
faithful
bellringer
.
He
endured
everything
on
the
part
of
the
*NL*
archdeacon
,
insults
,
threats
,
blows
,
without
murmuring
a
complaint
.
At
*NL*
the
most
,
he
gazed
uneasily
after
Dom
Claude
when
the
latter
ascended
*NL*
the
staircase
of
the
tower
;
but
the
archdeacon
had
abstained
from
*NL*
presenting
himself
again
before
the
gypsy
's
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
that
night
,
accordingly
,
Quasimodo
,
after
having
cast
a
glance
at
his
*NL*
poor
bells
which
he
so
neglected
now
,
Jacqueline
,
Marie
,
and
Thibauld
,
*NL*
mounted
to
the
summit
of
the
Northern
tower
,
and
there
setting
his
dark
*NL*
lanturn
,
well
closed
,
upon
the
leads
,
he
began
to
gaze
at
Paris
.
The
*NL*
night
,
as
we
have
already
said
,
was
very
dark
.
Paris
which
,
so
to
*NL*
speak
was
not
lighted
at
that
epoch
,
presented
to
the
eye
a
confused
*NL*
collection
of
black
masses
,
cut
here
and
there
by
the
whitish
curve
of
*NL*
the
Seine
.
Quasimodo
no
longer
saw
any
light
with
the
exception
of
one
*NL*
window
in
a
distant
edifice
,
whose
vague
and
sombre
profile
was
outlined
*NL*
well
above
the
roofs
,
in
the
direction
of
the
Porte
Sainte-Antoine
.
*NL*
There
also
,
there
was
some
one
awake
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
only
eye
of
the
bellringer
peered
into
that
horizon
of
mist
and
*NL*
night
,
he
felt
within
him
an
inexpressible
uneasiness
.
For
several
days
*NL*
he
had
been
upon
his
guard
.
He
had
perceived
men
of
sinister
mien
,
who
*NL*
never
took
their
eyes
from
the
young
girl
's
asylum
,
prowling
constantly
*NL*
about
the
church
.
He
fancied
that
some
plot
might
be
in
process
of
*NL*
formation
against
the
unhappy
refugee
.
He
imagined
that
there
existed
*NL*
a
popular
hatred
against
her
,
as
against
himself
,
and
that
it
was
very
*NL*
possible
that
something
might
happen
soon
.
Hence
he
remained
upon
his
*NL*
tower
on
the
watch
,
``
dreaming
in
his
dream-place
,
''
as
Rabelais
says
,
*NL*
with
his
eye
directed
alternately
on
the
cell
and
on
Paris
,
keeping
*NL*
faithful
guard
,
like
a
good
dog
,
with
a
thousand
suspicions
in
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
,
while
he
was
scrutinizing
the
great
city
with
that
eye
*NL*
which
nature
,
by
a
sort
of
compensation
,
had
made
so
piercing
that
it
*NL*
could
almost
supply
the
other
organs
which
Quasimodo
lacked
,
it
*NL*
seemed
to
him
that
there
was
something
singular
about
the
Quay
de
la
*NL*
Vieille-Pelleterie
,
that
there
was
a
movement
at
that
point
,
that
the
*NL*
line
of
the
parapet
,
standing
out
blackly
against
the
whiteness
of
the
*NL*
water
was
not
straight
and
tranquil
,
like
that
of
the
other
quays
,
but
*NL*
that
it
undulated
to
the
eye
,
like
the
waves
of
a
river
,
or
like
the
*NL*
heads
of
a
crowd
in
motion
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
struck
him
as
strange
.
He
redoubled
his
attention
.
The
movement
*NL*
seemed
to
be
advancing
towards
the
City
.
There
was
no
light
.
It
lasted
*NL*
for
some
time
on
the
quay
;
then
it
gradually
ceased
,
as
though
that
*NL*
which
was
passing
were
entering
the
interior
of
the
island
;
then
*NL*
it
stopped
altogether
,
and
the
line
of
the
quay
became
straight
and
*NL*
motionless
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
moment
when
Quasimodo
was
lost
in
conjectures
,
it
seemed
to
*NL*
him
that
the
movement
had
re-appeared
in
the
Rue
du
Parvis
,
which
is
*NL*
prolonged
into
the
city
perpendicularly
to
the
facade
of
Notre-Dame
.
*NL*
At
length
,
dense
as
was
the
darkness
,
he
beheld
the
head
of
a
column
*NL*
debouch
from
that
street
,
and
in
an
instant
a
crowd
--
of
which
nothing
*NL*
could
be
distinguished
in
the
gloom
except
that
it
was
a
crowd
--
spread
*NL*
over
the
Place
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
spectacle
had
a
terror
of
its
own
.
It
is
probable
that
this
*NL*
singular
procession
,
which
seemed
so
desirous
of
concealing
itself
under
*NL*
profound
darkness
,
maintained
a
silence
no
less
profound
.
Nevertheless
,
*NL*
some
noise
must
have
escaped
it
,
were
it
only
a
trampling
.
But
this
*NL*
noise
did
not
even
reach
our
deaf
man
,
and
this
great
multitude
,
of
*NL*
which
he
saw
hardly
anything
,
and
of
which
he
heard
nothing
,
though
it
*NL*
was
marching
and
moving
so
near
him
,
produced
upon
him
the
effect
of
a
*NL*
rabble
of
dead
men
,
mute
,
impalpable
,
lost
in
a
smoke
.
It
seemed
to
*NL*
him
,
that
he
beheld
advancing
towards
him
a
fog
of
men
,
and
that
he
saw
*NL*
shadows
moving
in
the
shadow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
his
fears
returned
to
him
,
the
idea
of
an
attempt
against
the
gypsy
*NL*
presented
itself
once
more
to
his
mind
.
He
was
conscious
,
in
a
confused
*NL*
way
,
that
a
violent
crisis
was
approaching
.
At
that
critical
moment
he
*NL*
took
counsel
with
himself
,
with
better
and
prompter
reasoning
than
one
*NL*
would
have
expected
from
so
badly
organized
a
brain
.
Ought
he
to
awaken
*NL*
the
gypsy
?
to
make
her
escape
?
Whither
?
The
streets
were
invested
,
the
*NL*
church
backed
on
the
river
.
No
boat
,
no
issue
!
--
There
was
but
one
*NL*
thing
to
be
done
;
to
allow
himself
to
be
killed
on
the
threshold
of
*NL*
Notre-Dame
,
to
resist
at
least
until
succor
arrived
,
if
it
should
*NL*
arrive
,
and
not
to
trouble
la
Esmeralda
's
sleep
.
This
resolution
once
*NL*
taken
,
he
set
to
examining
the
enemy
with
more
tranquillity
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
throng
seemed
to
increase
every
moment
in
the
church
square
.
Only
,
*NL*
he
presumed
that
it
must
be
making
very
little
noise
,
since
the
windows
*NL*
on
the
Place
remained
closed
.
All
at
once
,
a
flame
flashed
up
,
and
in
*NL*
an
instant
seven
or
eight
lighted
torches
passed
over
the
heads
of
the
*NL*
crowd
,
shaking
their
tufts
of
flame
in
the
deep
shade
.
Quasimodo
then
*NL*
beheld
distinctly
surging
in
the
Parvis
a
frightful
herd
of
men
and
*NL*
women
in
rags
,
armed
with
scythes
,
pikes
,
billhooks
and
partisans
,
whose
*NL*
thousand
points
glittered
.
Here
and
there
black
pitchforks
formed
horns
*NL*
to
the
hideous
faces
.
He
vaguely
recalled
this
populace
,
and
thought
*NL*
that
he
recognized
all
the
heads
who
had
saluted
him
as
Pope
of
the
*NL*
Fools
some
months
previously
.
One
man
who
held
a
torch
in
one
hand
and
*NL*
a
club
in
the
other
,
mounted
a
stone
post
and
seemed
to
be
haranguing
*NL*
them
.
At
the
same
time
the
strange
army
executed
several
evolutions
,
as
*NL*
though
it
were
taking
up
its
post
around
the
church
.
Quasimodo
picked
up
*NL*
his
lantern
and
descended
to
the
platform
between
the
towers
,
in
order
*NL*
to
get
a
nearer
view
,
and
to
spy
out
a
means
of
defence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clopin
Trouillefou
,
on
arriving
in
front
of
the
lofty
portal
of
*NL*
Notre-Dame
had
,
in
fact
,
ranged
his
troops
in
order
of
battle
.
Although
*NL*
he
expected
no
resistance
,
he
wished
,
like
a
prudent
general
,
to
*NL*
preserve
an
order
which
would
permit
him
to
face
,
at
need
,
a
sudden
*NL*
attack
of
the
watch
or
the
police
.
He
had
accordingly
stationed
his
*NL*
brigade
in
such
a
manner
that
,
viewed
from
above
and
from
a
distance
,
*NL*
one
would
have
pronounced
it
the
Roman
triangle
of
the
battle
of
*NL*
Ecnomus
,
the
boar
's
head
of
Alexander
or
the
famous
wedge
of
Gustavus
*NL*
Adolphus
.
The
base
of
this
triangle
rested
on
the
back
of
the
Place
in
*NL*
such
a
manner
as
to
bar
the
entrance
of
the
Rue
du
Parvis
;
one
of
its
*NL*
sides
faced
Hotel-Dieu
,
the
other
the
Rue
Saint-Pierre-aux-Boeufs
.
*NL*
Clopin
Trouillefou
had
placed
himself
at
the
apex
with
the
Duke
of
*NL*
Egypt
,
our
friend
Jehan
,
and
the
most
daring
of
the
scavengers
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
enterprise
like
that
which
the
vagabonds
were
now
undertaking
against
*NL*
Notre-Dame
was
not
a
very
rare
thing
in
the
cities
of
the
Middle
Ages
.
*NL*
What
we
now
call
the
``
police
''
did
not
exist
then
.
In
populous
cities
,
*NL*
especially
in
capitals
,
there
existed
no
single
,
central
,
regulating
*NL*
power
.
Feudalism
had
constructed
these
great
communities
in
a
singular
*NL*
manner
.
A
city
was
an
assembly
of
a
thousand
seigneuries
,
which
*NL*
divided
it
into
compartments
of
all
shapes
and
sizes
.
Hence
,
a
thousand
*NL*
conflicting
establishments
of
police
;
that
is
to
say
,
no
police
at
all
.
*NL*
In
Paris
,
for
example
,
independently
of
the
hundred
and
forty-one
lords
*NL*
who
laid
claim
to
a
manor
,
there
were
five
and
twenty
who
laid
claim
to
*NL*
a
manor
and
to
administering
justice
,
from
the
Bishop
of
Paris
,
who
had
*NL*
five
hundred
streets
,
to
the
Prior
of
Notre-Dame
des
Champs
,
who
had
*NL*
four
.
All
these
feudal
justices
recognized
the
suzerain
authority
of
the
*NL*
king
only
in
name
.
All
possessed
the
right
of
control
over
the
roads
.
*NL*
All
were
at
home
.
Louis
XI.
,
that
indefatigable
worker
,
who
so
largely
*NL*
began
the
demolition
of
the
feudal
edifice
,
continued
by
Richelieu
and
*NL*
Louis
XIV
.
for
the
profit
of
royalty
,
and
finished
by
Mirabeau
for
the
*NL*
benefit
of
the
people
,
--
Louis
XI
.
had
certainly
made
an
effort
to
break
*NL*
this
network
of
seignories
which
covered
Paris
,
by
throwing
violently
*NL*
across
them
all
two
or
three
troops
of
general
police
.
Thus
,
in
1465
,
an
*NL*
order
to
the
inhabitants
to
light
candles
in
their
windows
at
nightfall
,
*NL*
and
to
shut
up
their
dogs
under
penalty
of
death
;
in
the
same
year
,
*NL*
an
order
to
close
the
streets
in
the
evening
with
iron
chains
,
and
a
*NL*
prohibition
to
wear
daggers
or
weapons
of
offence
in
the
streets
*NL*
at
night
.
But
in
a
very
short
time
,
all
these
efforts
at
communal
*NL*
legislation
fell
into
abeyance
.
The
bourgeois
permitted
the
wind
to
*NL*
blow
out
their
candles
in
the
windows
,
and
their
dogs
to
stray
;
the
iron
*NL*
chains
were
stretched
only
in
a
state
of
siege
;
the
prohibition
to
*NL*
wear
daggers
wrought
no
other
changes
than
from
the
name
of
the
Rue
*NL*
Coupe-Gueule
to
the
name
of
the
Rue-Coupe-Gorge
*
which
is
an
evident
*NL*
progress
.
The
old
scaffolding
of
feudal
jurisdictions
remained
standing
;
*NL*
an
immense
aggregation
of
bailiwicks
and
seignories
crossing
each
*NL*
other
all
over
the
city
,
interfering
with
each
other
,
entangled
in
one
*NL*
another
,
enmeshing
each
other
,
trespassing
on
each
other
;
a
useless
*NL*
thicket
of
watches
,
sub-watches
and
counter-watches
,
over
which
,
with
*NL*
armed
force
,
passed
brigandage
,
rapine
,
and
sedition
.
Hence
,
in
this
*NL*
disorder
,
deeds
of
violence
on
the
part
of
the
populace
directed
against
*NL*
a
palace
,
a
hotel
,
or
house
in
the
most
thickly
populated
quarters
,
were
*NL*
not
unheard-of
occurrences
.
In
the
majority
of
such
cases
,
the
neighbors
*NL*
did
not
meddle
with
the
matter
unless
the
pillaging
extended
to
*NL*
themselves
.
They
stopped
up
their
ears
to
the
musket
shots
,
closed
their
*NL*
shutters
,
barricaded
their
doors
,
allowed
the
matter
to
be
concluded
*NL*
with
or
without
the
watch
,
and
the
next
day
it
was
said
in
Paris
,
*NL*
``
Etienne
Barbette
was
broken
open
last
night
.
The
Marshal
de
Clermont
*NL*
was
seized
last
night
,
etc.
''
Hence
,
not
only
the
royal
habitations
,
the
*NL*
Louvre
,
the
Palace
,
the
Bastille
,
the
Tournelles
,
but
simply
seignorial
*NL*
residences
,
the
Petit-Bourbon
,
the
Hotel
de
Sens
,
the
Hotel
d'
*NL*
Angouleme
,
etc.
,
had
battlements
on
their
walls
,
and
machicolations
over
*NL*
their
doors
.
Churches
were
guarded
by
their
sanctity
.
Some
,
among
the
*NL*
number
Notre-Dame
,
were
fortified
.
The
Abbey
of
Saint-German-des-Pres
*NL*
was
castellated
like
a
baronial
mansion
,
and
more
brass
expended
about
*NL*
it
in
bombards
than
in
bells
.
Its
fortress
was
still
to
be
seen
in
1610
.
*NL*
To-day
,
barely
its
church
remains
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
Cut-throat
.
Coupe-gueule
being
the
vulgar
word
for
cut-weazand
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
return
to
Notre-Dame
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
first
arrangements
were
completed
,
and
we
must
say
,
to
the
*NL*
honor
of
vagabond
discipline
,
that
Clopin
's
orders
were
executed
in
*NL*
silence
,
and
with
admirable
precision
,
the
worthy
chief
of
the
band
,
*NL*
mounted
on
the
parapet
of
the
church
square
,
and
raised
his
hoarse
and
*NL*
surly
voice
,
turning
towards
Notre-Dame
,
and
brandishing
his
torch
whose
*NL*
light
,
tossed
by
the
wind
,
and
veiled
every
moment
by
its
own
smoke
,
*NL*
made
the
reddish
facade
of
the
church
appear
and
disappear
before
the
*NL*
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
you
,
Louis
de
Beaumont
,
bishop
of
Paris
,
counsellor
in
the
Court
of
*NL*
Parliament
,
I
,
Clopin
Trouillefou
,
king
of
Thunes
,
grand
Coesre
,
prince
*NL*
of
Argot
,
bishop
of
fools
,
I
say
:
Our
sister
,
falsely
condemned
for
*NL*
magic
,
hath
taken
refuge
in
your
church
,
you
owe
her
asylum
and
safety
.
*NL*
Now
the
Court
of
Parliament
wishes
to
seize
her
once
more
there
,
and
you
*NL*
consent
to
it
;
so
that
she
would
be
hanged
to-morrow
in
the
Greve
,
if
*NL*
God
and
the
outcasts
were
not
here
.
If
your
church
is
sacred
,
so
is
our
*NL*
sister
;
if
our
sister
is
not
sacred
,
neither
is
your
church
.
That
is
why
*NL*
we
call
upon
you
to
return
the
girl
if
you
wish
to
save
your
church
,
or
*NL*
we
will
take
possession
of
the
girl
again
and
pillage
the
church
,
which
*NL*
will
be
a
good
thing
.
In
token
of
which
I
here
plant
my
banner
,
and
may
*NL*
God
preserve
you
,
bishop
of
Paris
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Quasimodo
could
not
,
unfortunately
,
hear
these
words
uttered
with
a
sort
*NL*
of
sombre
and
savage
majesty
.
A
vagabond
presented
his
banner
to
Clopin
,
*NL*
who
planted
it
solemnly
between
two
paving-stones
.
It
was
a
pitchfork
*NL*
from
whose
points
hung
a
bleeding
quarter
of
carrion
meat
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
done
,
the
King
of
Thunes
turned
round
and
cast
his
eyes
over
his
*NL*
army
,
a
fierce
multitude
whose
glances
flashed
almost
equally
with
their
*NL*
pikes
.
After
a
momentary
pause
,
--
``
Forward
,
my
Sons
!
''
he
cried
;
``
to
work
,
*NL*
locksmiths
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thirty
bold
men
,
square
shouldered
,
and
with
pick-lock
faces
,
stepped
*NL*
from
the
ranks
,
with
hammers
,
pincers
,
and
bars
of
iron
on
their
*NL*
shoulders
.
They
betook
themselves
to
the
principal
door
of
the
church
,
*NL*
ascended
the
steps
,
and
were
soon
to
be
seen
squatting
under
the
arch
,
*NL*
working
at
the
door
with
pincers
and
levers
;
a
throng
of
vagabonds
*NL*
followed
them
to
help
or
look
on
.
The
eleven
steps
before
the
portal
*NL*
were
covered
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
door
stood
firm
.
``
The
devil
!
't
is
hard
and
obstinate
!
''
said
one
.
*NL*
``
It
is
old
,
and
its
gristles
have
become
bony
,
''
said
another
.
``
Courage
,
*NL*
comrades
!
''
resumed
Clopin
.
``
I
wager
my
head
against
a
dipper
that
you
*NL*
will
have
opened
the
door
,
rescued
the
girl
,
and
despoiled
the
chief
*NL*
altar
before
a
single
beadle
is
awake
.
Stay
!
I
think
I
hear
the
lock
*NL*
breaking
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Clopin
was
interrupted
by
a
frightful
uproar
which
re-sounded
behind
him
*NL*
at
that
moment
.
He
wheeled
round
.
An
enormous
beam
had
just
fallen
from
*NL*
above
;
it
had
crushed
a
dozen
vagabonds
on
the
pavement
with
the
sound
*NL*
of
a
cannon
,
breaking
in
addition
,
legs
here
and
there
in
the
crowd
*NL*
of
beggars
,
who
sprang
aside
with
cries
of
terror
.
In
a
twinkling
,
the
*NL*
narrow
precincts
of
the
church
parvis
were
cleared
.
The
locksmiths
,
*NL*
although
protected
by
the
deep
vaults
of
the
portal
,
abandoned
the
door
*NL*
and
Clopin
himself
retired
to
a
respectful
distance
from
the
church
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
a
narrow
escape
!
''
cried
Jehan
.
``
I
felt
the
wind
,
of
it
,
*NL*
_
tete-de-boeuf
_
!
but
Pierre
the
Slaughterer
is
slaughtered
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
impossible
to
describe
the
astonishment
mingled
with
fright
which
*NL*
fell
upon
the
ruffians
in
company
with
this
beam
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
remained
for
several
minutes
with
their
eyes
in
the
air
,
more
*NL*
dismayed
by
that
piece
of
wood
than
by
the
king
's
twenty
thousand
*NL*
archers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Satan
!
''
muttered
the
Duke
of
Egypt
,
``
this
smacks
of
magic
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
the
moon
which
threw
this
log
at
us
,
''
said
Andry
the
Red
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Call
the
moon
the
friend
of
the
Virgin
,
after
that
!
''
went
on
Francois
*NL*
Chanteprune
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
thousand
popes
!
''
exclaimed
Clopin
,
``
you
are
all
fools
!
''
But
he
did
*NL*
not
know
how
to
explain
the
fall
of
the
beam
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
nothing
could
be
distinguished
on
the
facade
,
to
whose
summit
*NL*
the
light
of
the
torches
did
not
reach
.
The
heavy
beam
lay
in
the
middle
*NL*
of
the
enclosure
,
and
groans
were
heard
from
the
poor
wretches
who
had
*NL*
received
its
first
shock
,
and
who
had
been
almost
cut
in
twain
,
on
the
*NL*
angle
of
the
stone
steps
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
King
of
Thunes
,
his
first
amazement
passed
,
finally
found
an
*NL*
explanation
which
appeared
plausible
to
his
companions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Throat
of
God
!
are
the
canons
defending
themselves
?
To
the
sack
,
then
!
*NL*
to
the
sack
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
sack
!
''
repeated
the
rabble
,
with
a
furious
hurrah
.
A
discharge
*NL*
of
crossbows
and
hackbuts
against
the
front
of
the
church
followed
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
detonation
,
the
peaceable
inhabitants
of
the
surrounding
houses
*NL*
woke
up
;
many
windows
were
seen
to
open
,
and
nightcaps
and
hands
holding
*NL*
candles
appeared
at
the
casements
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fire
at
the
windows
,
''
shouted
Clopin
.
The
windows
were
immediately
*NL*
closed
,
and
the
poor
bourgeois
,
who
had
hardly
had
time
to
cast
*NL*
a
frightened
glance
on
this
scene
of
gleams
and
tumult
,
returned
,
*NL*
perspiring
with
fear
to
their
wives
,
asking
themselves
whether
the
*NL*
witches
'
sabbath
was
now
being
held
in
the
parvis
of
Notre-Dame
,
*NL*
or
whether
there
was
an
assault
of
Burgundians
,
as
in
'
64
.
Then
the
*NL*
husbands
thought
of
theft
;
the
wives
,
of
rape
;
and
all
trembled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
sack
!
''
repeated
the
thieves
'
crew
;
but
they
dared
not
approach
.
*NL*
They
stared
at
the
beam
,
they
stared
at
the
church
.
The
beam
did
not
*NL*
stir
,
the
edifice
preserved
its
calm
and
deserted
air
;
but
something
*NL*
chilled
the
outcasts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
work
,
locksmiths
!
''
shouted
Trouillefou
.
``
Let
the
door
be
forced
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
took
a
step
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Beard
and
belly
!
''
said
Clopin
,
``
here
be
men
afraid
of
a
beam
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
An
old
locksmith
addressed
him
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Captain
,
't
is
not
the
beam
which
bothers
us
,
't
is
the
door
,
which
is
*NL*
all
covered
with
iron
bars
.
Our
pincers
are
powerless
against
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
more
do
you
want
to
break
it
in
?
''
demanded
Clopin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
we
ought
to
have
a
battering
ram
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
King
of
Thunes
ran
boldly
to
the
formidable
beam
,
and
placed
his
*NL*
foot
upon
it
:
``
Here
is
one
!
''
he
exclaimed
;
''
't
is
the
canons
who
send
it
*NL*
to
you
.
''
And
,
making
a
mocking
salute
in
the
direction
of
the
church
,
*NL*
``
Thanks
,
canons
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
piece
of
bravado
produced
its
effects
,
--
the
spell
of
the
beam
was
*NL*
broken
.
The
vagabonds
recovered
their
courage
;
soon
the
heavy
joist
,
*NL*
raised
like
a
feather
by
two
hundred
vigorous
arms
,
was
flung
with
fury
*NL*
against
the
great
door
which
they
had
tried
to
batter
down
.
At
the
sight
*NL*
of
that
long
beam
,
in
the
half-light
which
the
infrequent
torches
of
*NL*
the
brigands
spread
over
the
Place
,
thus
borne
by
that
crowd
of
men
who
*NL*
dashed
it
at
a
run
against
the
church
,
one
would
have
thought
that
he
*NL*
beheld
a
monstrous
beast
with
a
thousand
feet
attacking
with
lowered
*NL*
head
the
giant
of
stone
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
shock
of
the
beam
,
the
half
metallic
door
sounded
like
an
immense
*NL*
drum
;
it
was
not
burst
in
,
but
the
whole
cathedral
trembled
,
and
the
*NL*
deepest
cavities
of
the
edifice
were
heard
to
echo
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
moment
,
a
shower
of
large
stones
began
to
fall
from
the
top
*NL*
of
the
facade
on
the
assailants
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
devil
!
''
cried
Jehan
,
``
are
the
towers
shaking
their
balustrades
down
*NL*
on
our
heads
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
impulse
had
been
given
,
the
King
of
Thunes
had
set
the
example
.
*NL*
Evidently
,
the
bishop
was
defending
himself
,
and
they
only
battered
the
*NL*
door
with
the
more
rage
,
in
spite
of
the
stones
which
cracked
skulls
*NL*
right
and
left
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
remarkable
that
all
these
stones
fell
one
by
one
;
but
they
*NL*
followed
each
other
closely
.
The
thieves
always
felt
two
at
a
time
,
one
*NL*
on
their
legs
and
one
on
their
heads
.
There
were
few
which
did
not
*NL*
deal
their
blow
,
and
a
large
layer
of
dead
and
wounded
lay
bleeding
*NL*
and
panting
beneath
the
feet
of
the
assailants
who
,
now
grown
furious
,
*NL*
replaced
each
other
without
intermission
.
The
long
beam
continued
to
*NL*
belabor
the
door
,
at
regular
intervals
,
like
the
clapper
of
a
bell
,
the
*NL*
stones
to
rain
down
,
the
door
to
groan
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
has
no
doubt
divined
that
this
unexpected
resistance
which
*NL*
had
exasperated
the
outcasts
came
from
Quasimodo
.
*NL*
*NL*
Chance
had
,
unfortunately
,
favored
the
brave
deaf
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
descended
to
the
platform
between
the
towers
,
his
ideas
were
*NL*
all
in
confusion
.
He
had
run
up
and
down
along
the
gallery
for
several
*NL*
minutes
like
a
madman
,
surveying
from
above
,
the
compact
mass
of
*NL*
vagabonds
ready
to
hurl
itself
on
the
church
,
demanding
the
safety
of
*NL*
the
gypsy
from
the
devil
or
from
God
.
The
thought
had
occurred
to
him
of
*NL*
ascending
to
the
southern
belfry
and
sounding
the
alarm
,
but
before
*NL*
he
could
have
set
the
bell
in
motion
,
before
Marie
's
voice
could
have
*NL*
uttered
a
single
clamor
,
was
there
not
time
to
burst
in
the
door
of
the
*NL*
church
ten
times
over
?
It
was
precisely
the
moment
when
the
locksmiths
*NL*
were
advancing
upon
it
with
their
tools
.
What
was
to
be
done
?
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
,
he
remembered
that
some
masons
had
been
at
work
all
day
*NL*
repairing
the
wall
,
the
timber-work
,
and
the
roof
of
the
south
tower
.
*NL*
This
was
a
flash
of
light
.
The
wall
was
of
stone
,
the
roof
of
lead
,
the
*NL*
timber-work
of
wood
.
-LRB-
That
prodigious
timber-work
,
so
dense
that
it
was
*NL*
called
``
the
forest
.
''
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
Quasimodo
hastened
to
that
tower
.
The
lower
chambers
were
,
in
fact
,
full
*NL*
of
materials
.
There
were
piles
of
rough
blocks
of
stone
,
sheets
of
lead
*NL*
in
rolls
,
bundles
of
laths
,
heavy
beams
already
notched
with
the
saw
,
*NL*
heaps
of
plaster
.
*NL*
*NL*
Time
was
pressing
,
The
pikes
and
hammers
were
at
work
below
.
With
a
*NL*
strength
which
the
sense
of
danger
increased
tenfold
,
he
seized
one
*NL*
of
the
beams
--
the
longest
and
heaviest
;
he
pushed
it
out
through
a
*NL*
loophole
,
then
,
grasping
it
again
outside
of
the
tower
,
he
made
it
slide
*NL*
along
the
angle
of
the
balustrade
which
surrounds
the
platform
,
and
*NL*
let
it
fly
into
the
abyss
.
The
enormous
timber
,
during
that
fall
of
a
*NL*
hundred
and
sixty
feet
,
scraping
the
wall
,
breaking
the
carvings
,
turned
*NL*
many
times
on
its
centre
,
like
the
arm
of
a
windmill
flying
off
alone
*NL*
through
space
.
At
last
it
reached
the
ground
,
the
horrible
cry
arose
,
*NL*
and
the
black
beam
,
as
it
rebounded
from
the
pavement
,
resembled
a
*NL*
serpent
leaping
.
*NL*
*NL*
Quasimodo
beheld
the
outcasts
scatter
at
the
fall
of
the
beam
,
like
*NL*
ashes
at
the
breath
of
a
child
.
He
took
advantage
of
their
fright
,
and
*NL*
while
they
were
fixing
a
superstitious
glance
on
the
club
which
had
*NL*
fallen
from
heaven
,
and
while
they
were
putting
out
the
eyes
of
the
*NL*
stone
saints
on
the
front
with
a
discharge
of
arrows
and
buckshot
,
*NL*
Quasimodo
was
silently
piling
up
plaster
,
stones
,
and
rough
blocks
of
*NL*
stone
,
even
the
sacks
of
tools
belonging
to
the
masons
,
on
the
edge
of
*NL*
the
balustrade
from
which
the
beam
had
already
been
hurled
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
,
as
soon
as
they
began
to
batter
the
grand
door
,
the
shower
of
*NL*
rough
blocks
of
stone
began
to
fall
,
and
it
seemed
to
them
that
the
*NL*
church
itself
was
being
demolished
over
their
heads
.
*NL*
*NL*
Any
one
who
could
have
beheld
Quasimodo
at
that
moment
would
have
been
*NL*
frightened
.
Independently
of
the
projectiles
which
he
had
piled
upon
the
*NL*
balustrade
,
he
had
collected
a
heap
of
stones
on
the
platform
itself
.
As
*NL*
fast
as
the
blocks
on
the
exterior
edge
were
exhausted
,
he
drew
on
the
*NL*
heap
.
Then
he
stooped
and
rose
,
stooped
and
rose
again
with
incredible
*NL*
activity
.
His
huge
gnome
's
head
bent
over
the
balustrade
,
then
an
*NL*
enormous
stone
fell
,
then
another
,
then
another
.
From
time
to
time
,
he
*NL*
followed
a
fine
stone
with
his
eye
,
and
when
it
did
good
execution
,
he
*NL*
said
,
``
Hum
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
the
beggars
did
not
grow
discouraged
.
The
thick
door
on
which
*NL*
they
were
venting
their
fury
had
already
trembled
more
than
twenty
*NL*
times
beneath
the
weight
of
their
oaken
battering-ram
,
multiplied
by
the
*NL*
strength
of
a
hundred
men
.
The
panels
cracked
,
the
carved
work
flew
into
*NL*
splinters
,
the
hinges
,
at
every
blow
,
leaped
from
their
pins
,
the
planks
*NL*
yawned
,
the
wood
crumbled
to
powder
,
ground
between
the
iron
sheathing
.
*NL*
Fortunately
for
Quasimodo
,
there
was
more
iron
than
wood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
he
felt
that
the
great
door
was
yielding
.
Although
he
did
*NL*
not
hear
it
,
every
blow
of
the
ram
reverberated
simultaneously
in
the
*NL*
vaults
of
the
church
and
within
it
.
From
above
he
beheld
the
vagabonds
,
*NL*
filled
with
triumph
and
rage
,
shaking
their
fists
at
the
gloomy
facade
;
*NL*
and
both
on
the
gypsy
's
account
and
his
own
he
envied
the
wings
of
the
*NL*
owls
which
flitted
away
above
his
head
in
flocks
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
shower
of
stone
blocks
was
not
sufficient
to
repel
the
assailants
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
of
anguish
,
he
noticed
,
a
little
lower
down
than
the
*NL*
balustrade
whence
he
was
crushing
the
thieves
,
two
long
stone
gutters
*NL*
which
discharged
immediately
over
the
great
door
;
the
internal
orifice
*NL*
of
these
gutters
terminated
on
the
pavement
of
the
platform
.
An
idea
*NL*
occurred
to
him
;
he
ran
in
search
of
a
fagot
in
his
bellringer
's
den
,
*NL*
placed
on
this
fagot
a
great
many
bundles
of
laths
,
and
many
rolls
of
*NL*
lead
,
munitions
which
he
had
not
employed
so
far
,
and
having
arranged
*NL*
this
pile
in
front
of
the
hole
to
the
two
gutters
,
he
set
it
on
fire
*NL*
with
his
lantern
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
this
time
,
since
the
stones
no
longer
fell
,
the
outcasts
ceased
*NL*
to
gaze
into
the
air
.
The
bandits
,
panting
like
a
pack
of
hounds
who
are
*NL*
forcing
a
boar
into
his
lair
,
pressed
tumultuously
round
the
great
*NL*
door
,
all
disfigured
by
the
battering
ram
,
but
still
standing
.
They
were
*NL*
waiting
with
a
quiver
for
the
great
blow
which
should
split
it
open
.
*NL*
They
vied
with
each
other
in
pressing
as
close
as
possible
,
in
order
to
*NL*
dash
among
the
first
,
when
it
should
open
,
into
that
opulent
cathedral
,
*NL*
a
vast
reservoir
where
the
wealth
of
three
centuries
had
been
piled
up
.
*NL*
They
reminded
each
other
with
roars
of
exultation
and
greedy
lust
,
of
*NL*
the
beautiful
silver
crosses
,
the
fine
copes
of
brocade
,
the
beautiful
*NL*
tombs
of
silver
gilt
,
the
great
magnificences
of
the
choir
,
the
*NL*
dazzling
festivals
,
the
Christmasses
sparkling
with
torches
,
the
*NL*
Easters
sparkling
with
sunshine
,
--
all
those
splendid
solemneties
wherein
*NL*
chandeliers
,
ciboriums
,
tabernacles
,
and
reliquaries
,
studded
the
altars
*NL*
with
a
crust
of
gold
and
diamonds
.
Certainly
,
at
that
fine
moment
,
*NL*
thieves
and
pseudo
sufferers
,
doctors
in
stealing
,
and
vagabonds
,
were
*NL*
thinking
much
less
of
delivering
the
gypsy
than
of
pillaging
Notre-Dame
.
*NL*
We
could
even
easily
believe
that
for
a
goodly
number
among
them
la
*NL*
Esmeralda
was
only
a
pretext
,
if
thieves
needed
pretexts
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
,
at
the
moment
when
they
were
grouping
themselves
round
the
*NL*
ram
for
a
last
effort
,
each
one
holding
his
breath
and
stiffening
his
*NL*
muscles
in
order
to
communicate
all
his
force
to
the
decisive
blow
,
a
*NL*
howl
more
frightful
still
than
that
which
had
burst
forth
and
expired
*NL*
beneath
the
beam
,
rose
among
them
.
Those
who
did
not
cry
out
,
those
who
*NL*
were
still
alive
,
looked
.
Two
streams
of
melted
lead
were
falling
from
*NL*
the
summit
of
the
edifice
into
the
thickest
of
the
rabble
.
That
sea
of
*NL*
men
had
just
sunk
down
beneath
the
boiling
metal
,
which
had
made
,
at
the
*NL*
two
points
where
it
fell
,
two
black
and
smoking
holes
in
the
crowd
,
such
*NL*
as
hot
water
would
make
in
snow
.
Dying
men
,
half
consumed
and
groaning
*NL*
with
anguish
,
could
be
seen
writhing
there
.
Around
these
two
principal
*NL*
streams
there
were
drops
of
that
horrible
rain
,
which
scattered
over
the
*NL*
assailants
and
entered
their
skulls
like
gimlets
of
fire
.
It
was
a
heavy
*NL*
fire
which
overwhelmed
these
wretches
with
a
thousand
hailstones
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
outcry
was
heartrending
.
They
fled
pell-mell
,
hurling
the
beam
upon
*NL*
the
bodies
,
the
boldest
as
well
as
the
most
timid
,
and
the
parvis
was
*NL*
cleared
a
second
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
eyes
were
raised
to
the
top
of
the
church
.
They
beheld
there
an
*NL*
extraordinary
sight
.
On
the
crest
of
the
highest
gallery
,
higher
than
*NL*
the
central
rose
window
,
there
was
a
great
flame
rising
between
the
two
*NL*
towers
with
whirlwinds
of
sparks
,
a
vast
,
disordered
,
and
furious
flame
,
*NL*
a
tongue
of
which
was
borne
into
the
smoke
by
the
wind
,
from
time
to
*NL*
time
.
Below
that
fire
,
below
the
gloomy
balustrade
with
its
trefoils
*NL*
showing
darkly
against
its
glare
,
two
spouts
with
monster
throats
were
*NL*
vomiting
forth
unceasingly
that
burning
rain
,
whose
silvery
stream
stood
*NL*
out
against
the
shadows
of
the
lower
facade
.
As
they
approached
the
*NL*
earth
,
these
two
jets
of
liquid
lead
spread
out
in
sheaves
,
like
water
*NL*
springing
from
the
thousand
holes
of
a
watering-pot
.
Above
the
flame
,
*NL*
the
enormous
towers
,
two
sides
of
each
of
which
were
visible
in
sharp
*NL*
outline
,
the
one
wholly
black
,
the
other
wholly
red
,
seemed
still
more
*NL*
vast
with
all
the
immensity
of
the
shadow
which
they
cast
even
to
the
*NL*
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
innumerable
sculptures
of
demons
and
dragons
assumed
a
lugubrious
*NL*
aspect
.
The
restless
light
of
the
flame
made
them
move
to
the
eye
.
There
*NL*
were
griffins
which
had
the
air
of
laughing
,
gargoyles
which
one
fancied
*NL*
one
heard
yelping
,
salamanders
which
puffed
at
the
fire
,
tarasques
*
*NL*
which
sneezed
in
the
smoke
.
And
among
the
monsters
thus
roused
from
*NL*
their
sleep
of
stone
by
this
flame
,
by
this
noise
,
there
was
one
who
*NL*
walked
about
,
and
who
was
seen
,
from
time
to
time
,
to
pass
across
the
*NL*
glowing
face
of
the
pile
,
like
a
bat
in
front
of
a
candle
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
The
representation
of
a
monstrous
animal
solemnly
drawn
about
*NL*
in
Tarascon
and
other
French
towns
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Without
doubt
,
this
strange
beacon
light
would
awaken
far
away
,
the
*NL*
woodcutter
of
the
hills
of
Bicetre
,
terrified
to
behold
the
gigantic
*NL*
shadow
of
the
towers
of
Notre-Dame
quivering
over
his
heaths
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
terrified
silence
ensued
among
the
outcasts
,
during
which
nothing
was
*NL*
heard
,
but
the
cries
of
alarm
of
the
canons
shut
up
in
their
cloister
,
*NL*
and
more
uneasy
than
horses
in
a
burning
stable
,
the
furtive
sound
*NL*
of
windows
hastily
opened
and
still
more
hastily
closed
,
the
internal
*NL*
hurly-burly
of
the
houses
and
of
the
Hotel-Dieu
,
the
wind
in
the
flame
,
*NL*
the
last
death-rattle
of
the
dying
,
and
the
continued
crackling
of
the
*NL*
rain
of
lead
upon
the
pavement
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meanwhile
,
the
principal
vagabonds
had
retired
beneath
the
porch
*NL*
of
the
Gondelaurier
mansion
,
and
were
holding
a
council
of
war
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Duke
of
Egypt
,
seated
on
a
stone
post
,
contemplated
the
*NL*
phantasmagorical
bonfire
,
glowing
at
a
height
of
two
hundred
feet
in
the
*NL*
air
,
with
religious
terror
.
Clopin
Trouillefou
bit
his
huge
fists
with
*NL*
rage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Impossible
to
get
in
!
''
he
muttered
between
his
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
old
,
enchanted
church
!
''
grumbled
the
aged
Bohemian
,
Mathias
Hungadi
*NL*
Spicali
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
Pope
's
whiskers
!
''
went
on
a
sham
soldier
,
who
had
once
been
in
*NL*
service
,
``
here
are
church
gutters
spitting
melted
lead
at
you
better
*NL*
than
the
machicolations
of
Lectoure

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
see
that
demon
passing
and
repassing
in
front
of
the
fire
?
''
*NL*
exclaimed
the
Duke
of
Egypt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardieu
,
't
is
that
damned
bellringer
,
't
is
Quasimodo

''
said
Clopin
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Bohemian
tossed
his
head
.
``
I
tell
you
,
that
't
is
the
spirit

*NL*
the
grand

He
has
the
form

an

armed
soldier

the
head
of
a
lion

Sometimes
he
rides
a
hideous
horse

He
changes

of

he
builds
towers

He
commands
*NL*
fifty

*NL*
*NL*
``

demanded
Clopin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He

*NL*
*NL*
Andry
the
Red
laughed
in
an
idiotic
way
:
``
Notre-Dame
is
making
work
for

the
hospital

he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is

then

exclaimed
the
King
of
*NL*
Thunes
,
stamping
his
foot
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Duke
of
Egypt
pointed
sadly
to
the
two
streams
of
boiling
lead
which
*NL*
did
not
cease
to
streak
the
black
facade
,
like
two
long
distaffs

*NL*
*NL*
``

remarked

It

fast

Jehan
gazed
at

cracked
his

bristled

'T

the

kings
of
France

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
that
to
me
?
''
said
Clopin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
!
At
the
end
of
that
gallery
there
is
a
door
which
is
never
*NL*
fastened
otherwise
than
with
a
latch
,
and
with
this
ladder
I
ascend
,
and
*NL*
I
am
in
the
church

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Child
let
me
be
the
first
to
ascend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
comrade

the

is
mine

Come

you
shall
be
the
second

*NL*
*NL*
``
May

''
said
surly
Clopin
,
``
I
wo
n't
be
second
to
*NL*
anybody
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
find
a
ladder

Clopin

''
*NL*
*NL*
Jehan
set
out
on
a
run
across
the
Place
,
dragging
his
ladder
and
*NL*
shouting
:
``
Follow
me
,
lads
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
an
instant
the
ladder
was
raised
,
and
propped
against
the
balustrade
*NL*
of
the
lower
gallery
,
above
one
of
the
lateral
doors
.
The
throng
of
*NL*
vagabonds
,
uttering
loud
acclamations
,
crowded
to
its
foot
to
ascend
.
*NL*
But
Jehan
maintained
his
right
,
and
was
the
first
to
set
foot
on
the
*NL*
rungs
.
The
passage
was
tolerably
long
.
The
gallery
of
the
kings
of
*NL*
France
is
to-day
about
sixty
feet
above
the
pavement
.
The
eleven
steps
*NL*
of
the
flight
before
the
door
,
made
it
still
higher
.
Jehan
mounted
*NL*
slowly
,
a
good
deal
incommoded
by
his
heavy
armor
,
holding
his
crossbow
*NL*
in
one
hand
,
and
clinging
to
a
rung
with
the
other
.
When
he
reached
*NL*
the
middle
of
the
ladder
,
he
cast
a
melancholy
glance
at
the
poor
dead
*NL*
outcasts
,
with
which
the
steps
were
strewn
.
``
Alas
!
''
said
he
,
``
here
is
a
*NL*
heap
of
bodies
worthy
of
the
fifth
book
of
the
Iliad
!
''
Then
he
continued
*NL*
his
ascent
.
The
vagabonds
followed
him
.
There
was
one
on
every
rung
.
*NL*
At
the
sight
of
this
line
of
cuirassed
backs
,
undulating
as
they
rose
*NL*
through
the
gloom
,
one
would
have
pronounced
it
a
serpent
with
steel
*NL*
scales
,
which
was
raising
itself
erect
in
front
of
the
church
.
Jehan
who
*NL*
formed
the
head
,
and
who
was
whistling
,
completed
the
illusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
scholar
finally
reached
the
balcony
of
the
gallery
,
and
climbed
over
*NL*
it
nimbly
,
to
the
applause
of
the
whole
vagabond
tribe
.
Thus
master
of
*NL*
the
citadel
,
he
uttered
a
shout
of
joy
,
and
suddenly
halted
,
petrified
.
*NL*
He
had
just
caught
sight
of
Quasimodo
concealed
in
the
dark
,
with
*NL*
flashing
eye
,
behind
one
of
the
statues
of
the
kings
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
a
second
assailant
could
gain
a
foothold
on
the
gallery
,
the
*NL*
formidable
hunchback
leaped
to
the
head
of
the
ladder
,
without
uttering
*NL*
a
word
,
seized
the
ends
of
the
two
uprights
with
his
powerful
hands
,
*NL*
raised
them
,
pushed
them
out
from
the
wall
,
balanced
the
long
and
pliant
*NL*
ladder
,
loaded
with
vagabonds
from
top
to
bottom
for
a
moment
,
in
the
*NL*
midst
of
shrieks
of
anguish
,
then
suddenly
,
with
superhuman
force
,
*NL*
hurled
this
cluster
of
men
backward
into
the
Place
.
There
was
a
moment
*NL*
when
even
the
most
resolute
trembled
.
The
ladder
,
launched
backwards
,
*NL*
remained
erect
and
standing
for
an
instant
,
and
seemed
to
hesitate
,
then
*NL*
wavered
,
then
suddenly
,
describing
a
frightful
arc
of
a
circle
eighty
*NL*
feet
in
radius
,
crashed
upon
the
pavement
with
its
load
of
ruffians
,
*NL*
more
rapidly
than
a
drawbridge
when
its
chains
break
.
There
arose
an
*NL*
immense
imprecation
,
then
all
was
still
,
and
a
few
mutilated
wretches
*NL*
were
seen
,
crawling
over
the
heap
of
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
sound
of
wrath
and
grief
followed
the
first
cries
of
triumph
among
*NL*
the
besiegers
.
Quasimodo
,
impassive
,
with
both
elbows
propped
on
the
*NL*
balustrade
,
looked
on
.
He
had
the
air
of
an
old
,
bushy-headed
king
at
*NL*
his
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Jehan
Frollo
,
he
was
in
a
critical
position
.
He
found
himself
in
*NL*
the
gallery
with
the
formidable
bellringer
,
alone
,
separated
from
his
*NL*
companions
by
a
vertical
wall
eighty
feet
high
.
While
Quasimodo
was
*NL*
dealing
with
the
ladder
,
the
scholar
had
run
to
the
postern
which
he
*NL*
believed
to
be
open
.
It
was
not
.
The
deaf
man
had
closed
it
behind
him
*NL*
when
he
entered
the
gallery
.
Jehan
had
then
concealed
himself
behind
*NL*
a
stone
king
,
not
daring
to
breathe
,
and
fixing
upon
the
monstrous
*NL*
hunchback
a
frightened
gaze
,
like
the
man
,
who
,
when
courting
the
wife
*NL*
of
the
guardian
of
a
menagerie
,
went
one
evening
to
a
love
rendezvous
,
*NL*
mistook
the
wall
which
he
was
to
climb
,
and
suddenly
found
himself
face
*NL*
to
face
with
a
white
bear
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
first
few
moments
,
the
deaf
man
paid
no
heed
to
him
;
but
at
last
*NL*
he
turned
his
head
,
and
suddenly
straightened
up
.
He
had
just
caught
*NL*
sight
of
the
scholar
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jehan
prepared
himself
for
a
rough
shock
,
but
the
deaf
man
remained
*NL*
motionless
;
only
he
had
turned
towards
the
scholar
and
was
looking
at
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ho
ho
!
''
said
Jehan
,
``
what
do
you
mean
by
staring
at
me
with
that
*NL*
solitary
and
melancholy
eye
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
spoke
thus
,
the
young
scamp
stealthily
adjusted
his
crossbow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quasimodo
!
''
he
cried
,
``
I
am
going
to
change
your
surname
:
you
shall
be
*NL*
called
the
blind
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
shot
sped
.
The
feathered
vireton
*
whizzed
and
entered
the
*NL*
hunchback
's
left
arm
.
Quasimodo
appeared
no
more
moved
by
it
than
by
a
*NL*
scratch
to
King
Pharamond
.
He
laid
his
hand
on
the
arrow
,
tore
it
from
*NL*
his
arm
,
and
tranquilly
broke
it
across
his
big
knee
;
then
he
let
the
*NL*
two
pieces
drop
on
the
floor
,
rather
than
threw
them
down
.
But
Jehan
*NL*
had
no
opportunity
to
fire
a
second
time
.
The
arrow
broken
,
Quasimodo
*NL*
breathing
heavily
,
bounded
like
a
grasshopper
,
and
he
fell
upon
the
*NL*
scholar
,
whose
armor
was
flattened
against
the
wall
by
the
blow
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
An
arrow
with
a
pyramidal
head
of
iron
and
copper
spiral
wings
by
*NL*
which
a
rotatory
motion
was
communicated
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Then
in
that
gloom
,
wherein
wavered
the
light
of
the
torches
,
a
terrible
*NL*
thing
was
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Quasimodo
had
grasped
with
his
left
hand
the
two
arms
of
Jehan
,
who
did
*NL*
not
offer
any
resistance
,
so
thoroughly
did
he
feel
that
he
was
lost
.
*NL*
With
his
right
hand
,
the
deaf
man
detached
one
by
one
,
in
silence
,
with
*NL*
sinister
slowness
,
all
the
pieces
of
his
armor
,
the
sword
,
the
daggers
,
*NL*
the
helmet
,
the
cuirass
,
the
leg
pieces
.
One
would
have
said
that
it
was
*NL*
a
monkey
taking
the
shell
from
a
nut
.
Quasimodo
flung
the
scholar
's
*NL*
iron
shell
at
his
feet
,
piece
by
piece
.
When
the
scholar
beheld
himself
*NL*
disarmed
,
stripped
,
weak
,
and
naked
in
those
terrible
hands
,
he
made
no
*NL*
attempt
to
speak
to
the
deaf
man
,
but
began
to
laugh
audaciously
in
his
*NL*
face
,
and
to
sing
with
his
intrepid
heedlessness
of
a
child
of
sixteen
,
*NL*
the
then
popular
ditty
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Elle
est
bien
habillee
,
*NL*
La
ville
de
Cambrai
;
*NL*
Marafin
l'
a
pillee
_
...
''
*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
The
city
of
Cambrai
is
well
dressed
.
Marafin
plundered
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
finish
.
Quasimodo
was
seen
on
the
parapet
of
the
gallery
,
*NL*
holding
the
scholar
by
the
feet
with
one
hand
and
whirling
him
over
*NL*
the
abyss
like
a
sling
;
then
a
sound
like
that
of
a
bony
structure
in
*NL*
contact
with
a
wall
was
heard
,
and
something
was
seen
to
fall
which
*NL*
halted
a
third
of
the
way
down
in
its
fall
,
on
a
projection
in
the
*NL*
architecture
.
It
was
a
dead
body
which
remained
hanging
there
,
bent
*NL*
double
,
its
loins
broken
,
its
skull
empty
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
cry
of
horror
rose
among
the
vagabonds
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Vengeance
!
''
shouted
Clopin
.
``
To
the
sack
!
''
replied
the
multitude
.
*NL*
``
Assault
!
assault
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
came
a
tremendous
howl
,
in
which
were
mingled
all
tongues
,
all
*NL*
dialects
,
all
accents
.
The
death
of
the
poor
scholar
imparted
a
furious
*NL*
ardor
to
that
crowd
.
It
was
seized
with
shame
,
and
the
wrath
of
having
*NL*
been
held
so
long
in
check
before
a
church
by
a
hunchback
.
Rage
found
*NL*
ladders
,
multiplied
the
torches
,
and
,
at
the
expiration
of
a
few
*NL*
minutes
,
Quasimodo
,
in
despair
,
beheld
that
terrible
ant
heap
mount
on
*NL*
all
sides
to
the
assault
of
Notre-Dame
.
Those
who
had
no
ladders
had
*NL*
knotted
ropes
;
those
who
had
no
ropes
climbed
by
the
projections
of
*NL*
the
carvings
.
They
hung
from
each
other
's
rags
.
There
were
no
means
of
*NL*
resisting
that
rising
tide
of
frightful
faces
;
rage
made
these
fierce
*NL*
countenances
ruddy
;
their
clayey
brows
were
dripping
with
sweat
;
their
*NL*
eyes
darted
lightnings
;
all
these
grimaces
,
all
these
horrors
laid
siege
*NL*
to
Quasimodo
.
One
would
have
said
that
some
other
church
had
despatched
*NL*
to
the
assault
of
Notre-Dame
its
gorgons
,
its
dogs
,
its
drees
,
its
*NL*
demons
,
its
most
fantastic
sculptures
.
It
was
like
a
layer
of
living
*NL*
monsters
on
the
stone
monsters
of
the
facade
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
the
Place
was
studded
with
a
thousand
torches
.
This
scene
of
*NL*
confusion
,
till
now
hid
in
darkness
,
was
suddenly
flooded
with
light
.
*NL*
The
parvis
was
resplendent
,
and
cast
a
radiance
on
the
sky
;
the
bonfire
*NL*
lighted
on
the
lofty
platform
was
still
burning
,
and
illuminated
the
*NL*
city
far
away
.
The
enormous
silhouette
of
the
two
towers
,
projected
afar
*NL*
on
the
roofs
of
Paris
,
and
formed
a
large
notch
of
black
in
this
light
.
*NL*
The
city
seemed
to
be
aroused
.
Alarm
bells
wailed
in
the
distance
.
*NL*
The
vagabonds
howled
,
panted
,
swore
,
climbed
;
and
Quasimodo
,
powerless
*NL*
against
so
many
enemies
,
shuddering
for
the
gypsy
,
beholding
the
furious
*NL*
faces
approaching
ever
nearer
and
nearer
to
his
gallery
,
entreated
*NL*
heaven
for
a
miracle
,
and
wrung
his
arms
in
despair
.

CHAPTER
V
.
THE
RETREAT
IN
WHICH
MONSIEUR
LOUIS
OF
FRANCE
SAYS
HIS
*NL*
PRAYERS
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
has
not
,
perhaps
,
forgotten
that
one
moment
before
catching
*NL*
sight
of
the
nocturnal
band
of
vagabonds
,
Quasimodo
,
as
he
inspected
*NL*
Paris
from
the
heights
of
his
bell
tower
,
perceived
only
one
light
*NL*
burning
,
which
gleamed
like
a
star
from
a
window
on
the
topmost
story
*NL*
of
a
lofty
edifice
beside
the
Porte
Saint-Antoine
.
This
edifice
was
the
*NL*
Bastille
.
That
star
was
the
candle
of
Louis
XI
.
King
Louis
XI
.
had
,
in
*NL*
fact
,
been
two
days
in
Paris
.
He
was
to
take
his
departure
on
the
next
*NL*
day
but
one
for
his
citadel
of
Montilz-les-Tours
.
He
made
but
seldom
and
*NL*
brief
appearance
in
his
good
city
of
Paris
,
since
there
he
did
not
feel
*NL*
about
him
enough
pitfalls
,
gibbets
,
and
Scotch
archers
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
come
,
that
day
,
to
sleep
at
the
Bastille
.
The
great
chamber
five
*NL*
toises
*
square
,
which
he
had
at
the
Louvre
,
with
its
huge
chimney-piece
*NL*
loaded
with
twelve
great
beasts
and
thirteen
great
prophets
,
and
his
*NL*
grand
bed
,
eleven
feet
by
twelve
,
pleased
him
but
little
.
He
felt
*NL*
himself
lost
amid
all
this
grandeur
.
This
good
bourgeois
king
preferred
*NL*
the
Bastille
with
a
tiny
chamber
and
couch
.
And
then
,
the
Bastille
was
*NL*
stronger
than
the
Louvre
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
An
ancient
long
measure
in
France
,
containing
six
feet
*NL*
and
nearly
five
inches
English
measure
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
This
little
chamber
,
which
the
king
reserved
for
himself
in
the
famous
*NL*
state
prison
,
was
also
tolerably
spacious
and
occupied
the
topmost
*NL*
story
of
a
turret
rising
from
the
donjon
keep
.
It
was
circular
in
form
,
*NL*
carpeted
with
mats
of
shining
straw
,
ceiled
with
beams
,
enriched
with
*NL*
fleurs-de-lis
of
gilded
metal
with
interjoists
in
color
;
wainscoated
*NL*
with
rich
woods
sown
with
rosettes
of
white
metal
,
and
with
others
*NL*
painted
a
fine
,
bright
green
,
made
of
orpiment
and
fine
indigo
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
only
one
window
,
a
long
pointed
casement
,
latticed
with
brass
*NL*
wire
and
bars
of
iron
,
further
darkened
by
fine
colored
panes
with
the
*NL*
arms
of
the
king
and
of
the
queen
,
each
pane
being
worth
two
and
twenty
*NL*
sols
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
but
one
entrance
,
a
modern
door
,
with
a
fiat
arch
,
garnished
*NL*
with
a
piece
of
tapestry
on
the
inside
,
and
on
the
outside
by
one
of
*NL*
those
porches
of
Irish
wood
,
frail
edifices
of
cabinet-work
curiously
*NL*
wrought
,
numbers
of
which
were
still
to
be
seen
in
old
houses
a
hundred
*NL*
and
fifty
years
ago
.
``
Although
they
disfigure
and
embarrass
the
places
,
''
*NL*
says
Sauvel
in
despair
,
``
our
old
people
are
still
unwilling
to
get
rid
*NL*
of
them
,
and
keep
them
in
spite
of
everybody
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
chamber
,
nothing
was
to
be
found
of
what
furnishes
ordinary
*NL*
apartments
,
neither
benches
,
nor
trestles
,
nor
forms
,
nor
common
*NL*
stools
in
the
form
of
a
chest
,
nor
fine
stools
sustained
by
pillars
and
*NL*
counter-pillars
,
at
four
sols
a
piece
.
Only
one
easy
arm-chair
,
very
*NL*
magnificent
,
was
to
be
seen
;
the
wood
was
painted
with
roses
on
a
red
*NL*
ground
,
the
seat
was
of
ruby
Cordovan
leather
,
ornamented
with
long
*NL*
silken
fringes
,
and
studded
with
a
thousand
golden
nails
.
The
loneliness
*NL*
of
this
chair
made
it
apparent
that
only
one
person
had
a
right
to
sit
*NL*
down
in
this
apartment
.
Beside
the
chair
,
and
quite
close
to
the
window
,
*NL*
there
was
a
table
covered
with
a
cloth
with
a
pattern
of
birds
.
On
this
*NL*
table
stood
an
inkhorn
spotted
with
ink
,
some
parchments
,
several
pens
,
*NL*
and
a
large
goblet
of
chased
silver
.
A
little
further
on
was
a
brazier
,
*NL*
a
praying
stool
in
crimson
velvet
,
relieved
with
small
bosses
of
gold
.
*NL*
Finally
,
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
room
,
a
simple
bed
of
scarlet
and
*NL*
yellow
damask
,
without
either
tinsel
or
lace
;
having
only
an
ordinary
*NL*
fringe
.
This
bed
,
famous
for
having
borne
the
sleep
or
the
sleeplessness
*NL*
of
Louis
XI.
,
was
still
to
be
seen
two
hundred
years
ago
,
at
the
*NL*
house
of
a
councillor
of
state
,
where
it
was
seen
by
old
Madame
Pilou
,
*NL*
celebrated
in
_
Cyrus
_
under
the
name
``
Arricidie
''
and
of
``
la
Morale
*NL*
Vivante
''
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
the
chamber
which
was
called
``
the
retreat
where
Monsieur
Louis
*NL*
de
France
says
his
prayers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
moment
when
we
have
introduced
the
reader
into
it
,
this
retreat
*NL*
was
very
dark
.
The
curfew
bell
had
sounded
an
hour
before
;
night
was
*NL*
come
,
and
there
was
only
one
flickering
wax
candle
set
on
the
table
to
*NL*
light
five
persons
variously
grouped
in
the
chamber
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
on
which
the
light
fell
was
a
seigneur
superbly
clad
in
*NL*
breeches
and
jerkin
of
scarlet
striped
with
silver
,
and
a
loose
coat
*NL*
with
half
sleeves
of
cloth
of
gold
with
black
figures
.
This
splendid
*NL*
costume
,
on
which
the
light
played
,
seemed
glazed
with
flame
on
every
*NL*
fold
.
The
man
who
wore
it
had
his
armorial
bearings
embroidered
on
his
*NL*
breast
in
vivid
colors
;
a
chevron
accompanied
by
a
deer
passant
.
The
*NL*
shield
was
flanked
,
on
the
right
by
an
olive
branch
,
on
the
left
by
a
*NL*
deer
's
antlers
.
This
man
wore
in
his
girdle
a
rich
dagger
whose
hilt
,
*NL*
of
silver
gilt
,
was
chased
in
the
form
of
a
helmet
,
and
surmounted
by
a
*NL*
count
's
coronet
.
He
had
a
forbidding
air
,
a
proud
mien
,
and
a
head
*NL*
held
high
.
At
the
first
glance
one
read
arrogance
on
his
visage
;
at
the
*NL*
second
,
craft
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
standing
bareheaded
,
a
long
roll
of
parchment
in
his
hand
,
behind
*NL*
the
arm-chair
in
which
was
seated
,
his
body
ungracefully
doubled
up
,
his
*NL*
knees
crossed
,
his
elbow
on
the
table
,
a
very
badly
accoutred
personage
.
*NL*
Let
the
reader
imagine
in
fact
,
on
the
rich
seat
of
Cordova
leather
,
two
*NL*
crooked
knees
,
two
thin
thighs
,
poorly
clad
in
black
worsted
tricot
,
a
*NL*
body
enveloped
in
a
cloak
of
fustian
,
with
fur
trimming
of
which
more
*NL*
leather
than
hair
was
visible
;
lastly
,
to
crown
all
,
a
greasy
old
hat
of
*NL*
the
worst
sort
of
black
cloth
,
bordered
with
a
circular
string
of
leaden
*NL*
figures
.
This
,
in
company
with
a
dirty
skull-cap
,
which
hardly
allowed
a
*NL*
hair
to
escape
,
was
all
that
distinguished
the
seated
personage
.
He
held
*NL*
his
head
so
bent
upon
his
breast
,
that
nothing
was
to
be
seen
of
his
*NL*
face
thus
thrown
into
shadow
,
except
the
tip
of
his
nose
,
upon
which
*NL*
fell
a
ray
of
light
,
and
which
must
have
been
long
.
From
the
thinness
of
*NL*
his
wrinkled
hand
,
one
divined
that
he
was
an
old
man
.
It
was
Louis
XI
.
*NL*
At
some
distance
behind
them
,
two
men
dressed
in
garments
of
Flemish
*NL*
style
were
conversing
,
who
were
not
sufficiently
lost
in
the
shadow
to
*NL*
prevent
any
one
who
had
been
present
at
the
performance
of
Gringoire
's
*NL*
mystery
from
recognizing
in
them
two
of
the
principal
Flemish
envoys
,
*NL*
Guillaume
Rym
,
the
sagacious
pensioner
of
Ghent
,
and
Jacques
Coppenole
,
*NL*
the
popular
hosier
.
The
reader
will
remember
that
these
men
were
mixed
*NL*
up
in
the
secret
politics
of
Louis
XI
.
Finally
,
quite
at
the
end
of
*NL*
the
room
,
near
the
door
,
in
the
dark
,
stood
,
motionless
as
a
statue
,
a
*NL*
vigorous
man
with
thickset
limbs
,
a
military
harness
,
with
a
surcoat
*NL*
of
armorial
bearings
,
whose
square
face
pierced
with
staring
eyes
,
slit
*NL*
with
an
immense
mouth
,
his
ears
concealed
by
two
large
screens
of
flat
*NL*
hair
,
had
something
about
it
both
of
the
dog
and
the
tiger
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
were
uncovered
except
the
king
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gentleman
who
stood
near
the
king
was
reading
him
a
sort
of
long
*NL*
memorial
to
which
his
majesty
seemed
to
be
listening
attentively
.
The
*NL*
two
Flemings
were
whispering
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cross
of
God
!
''
grumbled
Coppenole
,
``
I
am
tired
of
standing
;
is
there
no
*NL*
chair
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rym
replied
by
a
negative
gesture
,
accompanied
by
a
discreet
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Croix-Dieu
!
''
resumed
Coppenole
,
thoroughly
unhappy
at
being
obliged
to
*NL*
lower
his
voice
thus
,
``
I
should
like
to
sit
down
on
the
floor
,
with
my
*NL*
legs
crossed
,
like
a
hosier
,
as
I
do
in
my
shop
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
good
care
that
you
do
not
,
Master
Jacques
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ouais
!
Master
Guillaume
!
can
one
only
remain
here
on
his
feet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
on
his
knees
,
''
said
Rym
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
the
king
's
voice
was
uplifted
.
They
held
their
peace
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fifty
sols
for
the
robes
of
our
valets
,
and
twelve
livres
for

*NL*
mantles

it

Pour

*NL*
Are
you
mad
,
Olivier
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
spoke
thus
,
the
old
man
raised
his
head
.
The
golden
shells
of
the
*NL*
collar
of
Saint-Michael
could
be
seen
gleaming
on
his
neck
.
The
candle
*NL*
fully
illuminated
his
gaunt
and
morose
profile
.
He
tore
the
papers
from
*NL*
the
other
's
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
ruining
us
!
''
he
cried
,
casting
his
hollow
eyes
over
the
scroll
.
*NL*
``
What
is
all
this
?
What
need
have
we
of
so
prodigious
a

Two

chaplains

livres
a
month
each
,
and
,
a
chapel

at
one
hundred

A

ninety

*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
he
cast
a
glance
at
the
silver
goblet
which
gleamed
upon
the
*NL*
table
.
He
coughed
and
continued
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Master
Olivier
,
the

sumptuousness
in

for
*NL*
the
fire
spreads
thence
through

Hence
,
Master
Olivier
,
*NL*
consider
this
said
once
for
all

Our
expenditure
increases
every

The

exceed

forty-three

*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
breathless
,
then
resumed
energetically
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
behold
around
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
All
remained
silent
.
This
was
one
of
those
fits
of
wrath
which
are
*NL*
allowed
to
take
their
course
.
He
continued
,
--
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
Here
he
smiled
,
in
the
consciousness
of
his
power
;
this
softened
his
bad
*NL*
humor
,
and
he
turned
towards
the
Flemings
,

*NL*

He

in

added

shaking
his

The
person
whom
he
designated
by

took
the

into

again

It

befits

the

offered

the

gave
a
hundred
lions

This
was
wild

very
fine

do

spend
still

Guillaume

bowed
low

his
surly
mien

had
the

air
of
one
of

The

paid

no

He

just
dipped

he
spat
out

the

Then
he
rose
,
leaned
on
the
arm

made
a

to

mute
who
stood
before

The

was

at

by
men
of

arms

all
loaded
down
with
iron

by
slender

bearing
flambeaux

It
marched
for
some

the
interior

gloomy
donjon

*NL*
pierced
with
staircases

corridors
even
in
the
very
thickness

the
*NL*
walls

The
captain
of
the
Bastille
marched
at
their
head

caused
the
*NL*
wickets
to
be
opened
before
the
bent

aged

who
coughed
as

walked

*NL*
At

all

man
bent
double
with
age

``

said
he
between
his
gums

for
he
had
*NL*
no

any

*NL*
At

after

passed
a
final
wicket
,
so
loaded
with
locks
that
*NL*
a
quarter

an

was

open

they
entered
a
vast

lofty
vaulted
hall
,
in
the

of
which
they
could
distinguish
by
the
*NL*
light
of
the
torches
,
a
huge
cubic
mass
of
masonry
,
iron
,
and
wood
.
The
*NL*
interior
was
hollow
.
It
was
one
of
those
famous
cages
of
prisoners
of
*NL*
state
,
which
were
called
``
the
little
daughters
of
the

In
its
*NL*
walls
there
were
two
or
three
little
windows
so
closely
trellised
with
*NL*
stout
iron
bars
;
that
the
glass
was
not
visible

The
door
was
a
large

flat
slab

the

door

serves

Only
here

the
occupant
was
alive

*NL*
*NL*
The
king
began
to
walk
slowly
round
the
little
edifice

examining
it
*NL*
carefully
,
while
Master

,
who
followed
him
,
read
aloud
the
note

*NL*

*NL*
At
this
oath

which
was
the
favorite
of
Louis
XI.
,
some
one
seemed
*NL*
to
awaken
in
the
interior
of
the
cage
;
the
sound
of
chains
was
heard
,
*NL*
grating
on
the
floor
,
and
a
feeble
voice
,
which
seemed
to
issue
from
the
*NL*
tomb
was
uplifted
.
``

The

*NL*
``
Three

The
lamentable
voice
which
had
proceeded
from

cage
had

frozen
all
present
,
even
Master
Olivier
himself
.
The
king
alone
wore
*NL*
the
air
of
not
having
heard

At
his
order
,
Master
Olivier
resumed
his
*NL*
reading
,
and
his
majesty
coldly
continued
his
inspection
of
the
cage

At

had
opened

closed
upon

During

several
despatches
had
been
placed
on

he
broke
the

a

appeared
to
exercise
the

,
to
take

without

communicating
to

he
began
to
dictate

in

low
voice

the
replies

the

wrote

The

spoke
so
low

Flemings
heard
nothing
of

dictation

some
isolated

rather
unintelligible
scraps

said
to
it
:
*NL*
``
Oh
!
I
would
burn
you
if
you
knew
what
there
was
in
my
head

''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
casting
about
him
once
more
the
cautious
and
uneasy
glance
of
the
*NL*
fox
re-entering
his
hole
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
matter
!
we
will
succor
monsieur
the
bailiff

Unfortunately
,
we
have
*NL*
but
few
troops
here

the
present
moment

against
so
great
a
populace

*NL*
We
must
wait
until
to-morrow

The

will
be
transmitted
to
the
City

*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
way

said
Gossip
Coictier
,
``
I
had
forgotten

*NL*
*NL*
``

cried
the
king
.
``
What

You
*NL*

''
*NL*
*NL*
Master
Olivier
quitted
the
room
and
returned
a
moment
later
with
the
two
*NL*
prisoners
,
surrounded
by
archers
of
the
guard
.
The
first
had
a
coarse
,
*NL*
idiotic
,
drunken
and
astonished
face
.
He
was
clothed
in
rags
,
and
walked
*NL*
with
one
knee
bent
and
dragging
his
leg
.
The
second
had
a
pallid
and
*NL*
smiling
countenance
,
with
which
the
reader
is
already
acquainted
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
king
surveyed
them
for
a
moment
without
uttering
a
word
,
then
*NL*
addressing
the
first
one
abruptly
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
your
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
were
you
going
to
do
in
this
damnable
sedition
?
''
The
outcast
*NL*
stared
at
the
king
,
and
swung
his
arms
with
a
stupid
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
one
of
those
awkwardly
shaped
heads
where
intelligence
is
about
*NL*
as
much
at
its
ease
as
a
light
beneath
an
extinguisher
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
not
,
''
said
he
.
``
They
went
,
I
went
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Were
you
not
going

outrageously
attack

pillage

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
that
they
were
going

That
is
*NL*
all

''
*NL*
*NL*
A
soldier
pointed
out
to
the
king
a
billhook
which
he
had
seized
on
the
*NL*
person
of
the
vagabond
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
recognize
this
weapon

''
demanded
the
king
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

my

I
am
a
vine-dresser

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do

added
Louis
XI.
,
*NL*
pointing
to
the
other
prisoner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
not
know
him

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
do

''
said
the
king
,
making
a
sign
with
his
finger
to
the
*NL*
silent
personage
who
stood
motionless
beside
the
door
,
to
whom
we
have
*NL*
already
called
the
reader
's
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gossip
Tristan

here

*NL*
*NL*
Tristan
l'Hermite
bowed
.
He
gave
an
order
in
a
low
voice
to
two
archers
,
*NL*
who
led
away
the
poor
vagabond
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
the
king
had
approached
the
second
prisoner
,
who
was
*NL*
perspiring
in
great
drops
:
``
Your

*NL*
*NL*
``

Pierre
Gringoire

*NL*

No

there

was
mere

I
was
unjustly

I
am
innocent

I

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
your

said
the
king
,
between
two
swallows
of
his
ptisan
.
*NL*
``
You
split
our

*NL*
*NL*
Tristan
l'Hermite
advanced
and
pointing
to
Gringoire
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sire
,
can
this
one
be
hanged
also

''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
first
word
that
he
had
uttered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Phew

replied
the
king
,
``
I
see
no

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

''
said
Gringoire
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
,
our
philosopher
was
greener
than
an
olive
.
He
perceived
*NL*
from
the
king
's
cold
and
indifferent
mien
that
there
was
no
other
*NL*
resource
than
something
very
pathetic
,
and
he
flung
himself
at
the
feet
*NL*
of
Louis
XI.
,
exclaiming
,
with
gestures
of
despair
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sire
!
will
your
majesty
deign
to
hear
me
.
Sire
!
break
not
in
thunder
*NL*
over
so
small
a
thing
as
myself
.
God
's
great
lightning
doth
not
bombard
*NL*
a
lettuce
.
Sire
,
you
are
an
august
and
,
very
puissant
monarch
;
have
pity
*NL*
on
a
poor
man
who
is
honest
,
and
who
would
find
it
more
difficult
to
*NL*
stir
up
a
revolt
than
a
cake
of
ice
would
to
give
out
a
spark
!
Very
*NL*
gracious
sire
,
kindness
is
the
virtue
of
a
lion
and
a
king
.
Alas
!
rigor
*NL*
only
frightens
minds
;
the
impetuous
gusts
of
the
north
wind
do
not
make
*NL*
the
traveller
lay
aside
his
cloak
;
the
sun
,
bestowing
his
rays
little
by
*NL*
little
,
warms
him
in
such
ways
that
it
will
make
him
strip
to
his
shirt
.
*NL*
Sire
,
you
are
the
sun
.
I
protest
to
you
,
my
sovereign
lord
and
master
,
*NL*
that
I
am
not
an
outcast
,
thief
,
and
disorderly
fellow
.
Revolt
and
*NL*
brigandage
belong
not
to
the
outfit
of
Apollo
.
I
am
not
the
man
to
fling
*NL*
myself
into
those
clouds
which
break
out
into
seditious
clamor
.
I
am
*NL*
your
majesty
's
faithful
vassal
.
That
same
jealousy
which
a
husband
*NL*
cherisheth
for
the
honor
of
his
wife
,
the
resentment
which
the
son
hath
*NL*
for
the
love
of
his
father
,
a
good
vassal
should
feel
for
the
glory
*NL*
of
his
king
;
he
should
pine
away
for
the
zeal
of
this
house
,
for
*NL*
the
aggrandizement
of
his
service
.
Every
other
passion
which
should
*NL*
transport
him
would
be
but
madness
.
These
,
sire
,
are
my
maxims
of
state
:
*NL*
then
do
not
judge
me
to
be
a
seditious
and
thieving
rascal
because
my
*NL*
garment
is
worn
at
the
elbows
.
If
you
will
grant
me
mercy
,
sire
,
I
will
*NL*
wear
it
out
on
the
knees
in
praying
to
God
for
you
night
and
morning
!
*NL*
Alas
!
I
am
not
extremely
rich
,
't
is
true
.
I
am
even
rather
poor
.
But
*NL*
not
vicious
on
that
account
.
It
is
not
my
fault
.
Every
one
knoweth
that
*NL*
great
wealth
is
not
to
be
drawn
from
literature
,
and
that
those
who
are
*NL*
best
posted
in
good
books
do
not
always
have
a
great
fire
in
winter
.
*NL*
The
advocate
's
trade
taketh
all
the
grain
,
and
leaveth
only
straw
to
the
*NL*
other
scientific
professions
.
There
are
forty
very
excellent
proverbs
*NL*
anent
the
hole-ridden
cloak
of
the
philosopher
.
Oh
,
sire
!
clemency
is
*NL*
the
only
light
which
can
enlighten
the
interior
of
so
great
a
soul
.
*NL*
Clemency
beareth
the
torch
before
all
the
other
virtues
.
Without
it
they
*NL*
are
but
blind
men
groping
after
God
in
the
dark
.
Compassion
,
which
is
*NL*
the
same
thing
as
clemency
,
causeth
the
love
of
subjects
,
which
is
the
*NL*
most
powerful
bodyguard
to
a
prince
.
What
matters
it
to
your
majesty
,
*NL*
who
dazzles
all
faces
,
if
there
is
one
poor
man
more
on
earth
,
a
poor
*NL*
innocent
philosopher
spluttering
amid
the
shadows
of
calamity
,
with
an
*NL*
empty
pocket
which
resounds
against
his
hollow
belly
?
Moreover
,
sire
,
*NL*
I
am
a
man
of
letters
.
Great
kings
make
a
pearl
for
their
crowns
by
*NL*
protecting
letters
.
Hercules
did
not
disdain
the
title
of
Musagetes
.
*NL*
Mathias
Corvin
favored
Jean
de
Monroyal
,
the
ornament
of
mathematics
.
*NL*
Now
,
't
is
an
ill
way
to
protect
letters
to
hang
men
of
letters
.
What
a
*NL*
stain
on
Alexander
if
he
had
hung
Aristoteles
!
This
act
would
not
be
a
*NL*
little
patch
on
the
face
of
his
reputation
to
embellish
it
,
but
a
very
*NL*
malignant
ulcer
to
disfigure
it
.
Sire
!
I
made
a
very
proper
epithalamium
*NL*
for
Mademoiselle
of
Flanders
and
Monseigneur
the
very
august
Dauphin
.
*NL*
That
is
not
a
firebrand
of
rebellion
.
Your
majesty
sees
that
I
am
not
*NL*
a
scribbler
of
no
reputation
,
that
I
have
studied
excellently
well
,
and
*NL*
that
I
possess
much
natural
eloquence
.
Have
mercy
upon
me
,
sire
!
In
so
*NL*
doing
you
will
perform
a
gallant
deed
to
our
Lady
,
and
I
swear
to
you
*NL*
that
I
am
greatly
terrified
at
the
idea
of
being
hanged
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
the
unhappy
Gringoire
kissed
the
king
's
slippers
,
and
*NL*
Guillaume
Rym
said
to
Coppenole
in
a
low
tone
:
``
He
doth
well
to
drag
*NL*
himself
on
the
earth
.
Kings
are
like
the
Jupiter
of
Crete
,
they
have
*NL*
ears
only
in
their
feet
.
''
And
without
troubling
himself
about
the
*NL*
Jupiter
of
Crete
,
the
hosier
replied
with
a
heavy
smile
,
and
his
eyes
*NL*
fixed
on
Gringoire
:
``
Oh
!
that
's
it
exactly
!
I
seem
to
hear
Chancellor
*NL*
Hugonet
craving
mercy
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Gringoire
paused
at
last
,
quite
out
of
breath
,
he
raised
his
head
*NL*
tremblingly
towards
the
king
,
who
was
engaged
in
scratching
a
spot
on
*NL*
the
knee
of
his
breeches
with
his
finger-nail
;
then
his
majesty
began
*NL*
to
drink
from
the
goblet
of
ptisan
.
But
he
uttered
not
a
word
,
and
this
*NL*
silence
tortured
Gringoire
.
At
last
the
king
looked
at
him
.
``
Here
is
a
*NL*
terrible
bawler
!
''
said
,
he
.
Then
,
turning
to
Tristan
l'Hermite
,
``
Bali
!
*NL*
let
him
go
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gringoire
fell
backwards
,
quite
thunderstruck
with
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
liberty
!
''
growled
Tristan
``
Doth
not
your
majesty
wish
to
have
him
*NL*
detained
a
little
while
in
a
cage
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gossip
,
''
retorted
Louis
XI.
,
``
think
you
that
't
is
for
birds
of
this
*NL*
feather
that
we
cause
to
be
made
cages
at
three
hundred
and
sixty-seven
*NL*
livres
,
eight
sous
,
three
deniers
apiece
?
Release
him
at
once
,
*NL*
the
wanton
-LRB-
Louis
XI
.
was
fond
of
this
word
which
formed
,
with
*NL*
_
Pasque-Dieu
_
,
the
foundation
of
his
joviality
-RRB-
,
and
put
him
out
with
a
*NL*
buffet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ugh
!
''
cried
Gringoire
,
``
what
a
great
king
is
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
for
fear
of
a
counter
order
,
he
rushed
towards
the
door
,
which
*NL*
Tristan
opened
for
him
with
a
very
bad
grace
.
The
soldiers
left
the
room
*NL*
with
him
,
pushing
him
before
them
with
stout
thwacks
,
which
Gringoire
*NL*
bore
like
a
true
stoical
philosopher
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
king
's
good
humor
since
the
revolt
against
the
bailiff
had
been
*NL*
announced
to
him
,
made
itself
apparent
in
every
way
.
This
unwonted
*NL*
clemency
was
no
small
sign
of
it
.
Tristan
l'Hermite
in
his
corner
wore
*NL*
the
surly
look
of
a
dog
who
has
had
a
bone
snatched
away
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
the
king
thrummed
gayly
with
his
fingers
on
the
arm
of
his
*NL*
chair
,
the
March
of
Pont-Audemer
.
He
was
a
dissembling
prince
,
but
one
*NL*
who
understood
far
better
how
to
hide
his
troubles
than
his
joys
.
These
*NL*
external
manifestations
of
joy
at
any
good
news
sometimes
proceeded
to
*NL*
very
great
lengths
thus
,
on
the
death
,
of
Charles
the
Bold
,
to
the
point
*NL*
of
vowing
silver
balustrades
to
Saint
Martin
of
Tours
;
on
his
advent
to
*NL*
the
throne
,
so
far
as
forgetting
to
order
his
father
's
obsequies
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
!
sire
!
''
suddenly
exclaimed
Jacques
Coictier
,
``
what
has
become
of
the
*NL*
acute
attack
of
illness
for
which
your
majesty
had
me
summoned
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
said
the
king
,
``
I
really
suffer
greatly
,
my
gossip
.
There
is
a
*NL*
hissing
in
my
ear
and
fiery
rakes
rack
my
chest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Coictier
took
the
king
's
hand
,
and
begun
to
feel
of
his
pulse
with
a
*NL*
knowing
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
,
Coppenole
,
''
said
Rym
,
in
a
low
voice
.
``
Behold
him

*NL*
Coictier

*NL*
*NL*
As
he
felt
the
king
's
pulse

greater
alarm

Louis

watched
him
with
some
anxiety

Coictier
grew
*NL*
visibly
more
gloomy

The

had
no

than

He
speculated
on

put
out

--

it

of

Master

,
*NL*
perceiving
the
king
to
be
in
a
liberal
mood
,
and
judging
the
moment
to

approached

As

Master

quitted
its

for
a

one

It
is
the
only
change
which
ever
takes
place
*NL*
in
a
courtier
's
visage

The
king
looked
him
well
in

said
in

a
dry
tone

*NL*
Our

have
not

without

waited

to
*NL*
recognize
in
Master
Olivier
that
terrible
Figaro
whom
Providence

the
*NL*
great
maker
of
dramas
,
mingled
so
artistically
in

long

bloody
*NL*
comedy
of
the
reign

Louis
XI

We
will
not
here
undertake
to
develop
*NL*
that
singular
figure

This
barber
of
the
king
had
three
names

At
court
*NL*
he
was
politely
called
Olivier
le
Daim
-LRB-
the
Deer
-RRB-
;
among
the
people
*NL*
Olivier
the
Devil
.
His
real
name
was
Olivier
le
Mauvais
.
*NL*
*NL*
Accordingly
,
Olivier
le
Mauvais
remained
motionless
,
sulking
at
the
*NL*
king
,
and
glancing
askance
at
Jacques
Coictier
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

he
said
between

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

Louis

with
singular
good
humor
;
*NL*
``
the
physician
has
more
credit
than
you

'T
is
very
simple

he
has
taken
*NL*
hold

by
the
whole

you
hold

only
by
the
chin

Come

*NL*
my
poor
barber

all
will
come
right

What
would
you
say

what
would
*NL*
become
of
your
office
if
I
were
a

like
Chilperic

*NL*
consisted
in

his

in

Olivier
perceiving
that

had
made
up
his
mind
to
laugh
,
and
that
*NL*
there
was
no
way
of
even
annoying
him
,
went
off
grumbling
to
execute
his
*NL*
orders
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
king
rose
,
approached
the
window
,
and
suddenly
opening
it
with
*NL*
extraordinary
agitation
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

yes

he
exclaimed
,
clapping
his
hands
,
``
yonder
is

The
hosier

in

the
signs

appeared

to
hold
his
own
against

*NL*
*NL*
``
Sire

the
Swiss
were
also
louts

Monsieur

Duke

a

he
turned
up
his
nose
at
that
rabble
rout
.
At
the
*NL*
battle
of
Grandson
,
sire

he
cried
:
`

Advoyer

himself
on

his
people
,
and
*NL*
when
the
glittering
Burgundian
army
came
in
contact
with
these
peasants
*NL*
in
bull
hides
,
it
flew
in
pieces
like
a
pane
of
glass
at

blow

Many

slain

indifferently

Louis

gazed
at

with
his
penetrating
eye

Coppenole

with

tranquil

made
the

approach

Listen

*NL*
*NL*
Louis
's
face
grew
sombre
and
dreamy
.
He
remained
silent
for
a
moment
,
*NL*
then
he
gently
patted
with
his
hand
the
thick
wall
of
the
donjon
,
as
one
*NL*
strokes
the
haunches
of
a
steed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

no

said
he

``
You
will
not
crumble
so
easily

will
you

my
good
*NL*
Bastille

*NL*
*NL*
And
turning
with
an
abrupt
gesture
towards
the
sturdy
Fleming
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
never
seen
a
revolt

Master
Jacques

*NL*
*NL*

I
have

said
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
set
to
work
to
make
a
revolt

''
said
the
king
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
replied
Coppenole
,
''
't
is
not
very
difficult
.
There
are
a
hundred
*NL*
ways
.
In
the
first
place
,
there
must
be
discontent
in
the
city
.
The
*NL*
thing
is
not
uncommon
.
And
then
,
the
character
of
the
inhabitants
.
Those
*NL*
of
Ghent
are
easy
to
stir
into
revolt
.
They
always
love
the
prince
's
*NL*
son
;
the
prince
,
never
.
Well
!
One
morning
,
I
will
suppose
,
some
one
*NL*
enters
my
shop
,
and
says
to
me
:
`
Father
Coppenole
,
there
is
this
and
*NL*
there
is
that
,
the
Demoiselle
of
Flanders
wishes
to
save
her
ministers
,
*NL*
the
grand
bailiff
is
doubling
the
impost
on
shagreen
,
or
something
*NL*
else
,

--
what
you
will
.
I
leave
my
work
as
it
stands
,
I
come
out
of
my
*NL*
hosier
's
stall
,
and
I
shout
:
`
To
the
sack
?
'
There
is
always
some
smashed
*NL*
cask
at
hand
.
I
mount
it
,
and
I
say
aloud
,
in
the
first
words
that
occur
*NL*
to
me
,
what
I
have
on
my
heart
;
and
when
one
is
of
the
people
,
sire
,
*NL*
one
always
has
something
on
the
heart
:
Then
people
troop
up
,
they
shout
,
*NL*
they
ring
the
alarm
bell
,
they
arm
the
louts
with
what
they
take
from
*NL*
the
soldiers
,
the
market
people
join
in
,
and
they
set
out
.
And
it
will
*NL*
always
be
thus
,
so
long
as
there
are
lords
in
the
seignories
,
bourgeois
*NL*
in
the
bourgs
,
and
peasants
in
the
country
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
against
whom
do
you
thus
rebel
?
''
inquired
the
king
;
``
against
your
*NL*
bailiffs
?
against
your
lords
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Sometimes

Against

*NL*
Louis

returned
and
seated
himself
,
saying
,
with
a
smile
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
here
they
have
only
got
as
far
as
the
bailiffs

*NL*
*NL*
At
that
instant
Olivier
le
Daim
returned
.
He
was
followed
by
two
pages
,
*NL*
who
bore
the
king
's
toilet
articles
;
but
what
struck
Louis
XI
.
was
that
*NL*
he
was
also
accompanied
by
the
provost
of
Paris
and
the
chevalier
of
*NL*
the
watch
,
who
appeared
to
be
in
consternation
.
The
spiteful
barber
*NL*
also
wore
an
air
of
consternation
,
which
was
one
of
contentment
beneath
,
*NL*
however
.
It
was
he
who
spoke
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sire
,
I
ask
your
majesty
's
pardon
for
the
calamitous
news
which
I
*NL*
bring

*NL*
*NL*
The
king
turned
quickly
and
grazed
the
mat
on
the
floor
with
the
feet
of
*NL*
his
chair
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
this
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sire

''
resumed
Olivier
le
Daim
,
with
the
malicious
air
of
a
man
who
*NL*
rejoices
that
he
is
about
to
deal
a
violent
blow
,
''
't
is
not
against
the
*NL*
bailiff
of
the
courts
that
this
popular
sedition
is
directed

*NL*
*NL*
``
Against
whom
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Against
you

*NL*
*NL*
The
aged
king
rose
erect
and
straight
as
a
young
man
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Explain
yourself

hour

the
sword
which
severed

Monsieur

not
*NL*
so
notched
that
it
can
not
yet
sever
yours

*NL*
*NL*
The
oath
was
formidable
;
Louis
XI
.
had
only
sworn
twice
in
the
course
of
*NL*
his
life
by
the
cross
of
Saint-Lo

*NL*
*NL*
Olivier
opened
his
mouth
to
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sire

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On

interrupted
the
king
violently

``

*NL*
*NL*
Olivier
knelt
down

said
coldly
,

*NL*
*NL*
``
Sire

a
sorceress

The
people
are
trying

take

thence
by

force

Monsieur

just

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

said
the
king
in
a
low
voice
,
all
pale
and
trembling
with
*NL*
wrath
.
``
Notre-Dame

lay

And
I
thought
that

were
acting
against

bailiff

'T
is
against
*NL*
myself

*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
rendered
young
by
fury
,
he
began
to
walk
up
and
down
with
long
*NL*
strides
.
He
no
longer
laughed
,
he
was
terrible
,
he
went
and
came
;
the
*NL*
fox
was
changed
into
a
hyaena
.
He
seemed
suffocated
to
such
a
degree
*NL*
that
he
could
not
speak
;
his
lips
moved
,
and
his
fleshless
fists
were
*NL*
clenched
.
All
at
once
he
raised
his
head
,
his
hollow
eye
appeared
full
*NL*
of
light
,
and
his
voice
burst
forth
like
a
clarion
:
``
Down
with

Go

slay

*NL*
*NL*
This
eruption
having
passed
,
he
returned
to
his
seat
,
and
said
with
cold
*NL*
and
concentrated
wrath
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here

*NL*
*NL*
Tristan
bowed
.
''
'T
is
well

*NL*
*NL*
He
added
,
after
a
silence
,
``
And
what
shall
I
do
with
the
sorceress
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
question
caused
the
king
to
meditate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
he
,
``
the
sorceress

Monsieur

what
did
the

people
wish

*NL*
*NL*
``
Sire

replied
the
provost
of

,
``
I
imagine
that
since

come

tear
her
from

asylum

because
that
*NL*
impunity
wounds
them

they
desire
to
hang
her

*NL*
*NL*
The
king
appeared
to
reflect
deeply
:
then
,
addressing
Tristan
l'Hermite
,
*NL*
``
Well

gossip
,
exterminate
the
people

hang
the
sorceress

*NL*
*NL*
``

it

said
Rym
in
a
low
tone
to
Coppenole
,
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Enough

replied
Tristan
.
``
If

*NL*
*NL*

said
the
king
,
scratching
his
ear
.
``
But

be
hung

nevertheless

*NL*
*NL*
Here
,
as
though
seized
with
a
sudden
idea
,
he
flung
himself
on
his
knees
*NL*
before
his
chair
,
took
off
his
hat
,
placed
it
on
the
seat

and
gazing
*NL*
devoutly
at
one
of
the
leaden
amulets

loaded
it
down

he
,
with
clasped

``

*NL*

He
made
the
sign
of
the
cross

rose
,
donned
his
hat
once
more
,

said

to
Tristan

Tristan
l'Hermite
bowed

departed

Then
the
king
,
dismissing
Rym
and

Coppenole
with
a
gesture
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``

Both
retired

gained
their

Coppenole
said
to
Guillaume

LITTLE
SWORD

On
emerging
from
the
Bastille
,
Gringoire
descended
the
Rue
Saint-Antoine
*NL*
with
the
swiftness
of
a
runaway
horse
.
On
arriving
at
the
Baudoyer
gate
,
*NL*
he
walked
straight
to
the
stone
cross
which
rose
in
the
middle
of
that
*NL*
place
,
as
though
he
were
able
to
distinguish
in
the
darkness
the
figure
*NL*
of
a
man
clad
and
cloaked
in
black
,
who
was
seated
on
the
steps
of
the
*NL*
cross
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is

said
Gringoire

The
personage
in
black
rose

*NL*
``
Death

CHATEAUPERS
TO
THE
RESCUE
.
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
will
,
perhaps
,
recall
the
critical
situation
in
which
we
left
*NL*
Quasimodo
.
The
brave
deaf
man
,
assailed
on
all
sides
,
had
lost
,
if
*NL*
not
all
courage
,
at
least
all
hope
of
saving
,
not
himself
-LRB-
he
was
not
*NL*
thinking
of
himself
-RRB-
,
but
the
gypsy
.
He
ran
distractedly
along
the
*NL*
gallery
.
Notre-Dame
was
on
the
point
of
being
taken
by
storm
by
*NL*
the
outcasts
.
All
at
once
,
a
great
galloping
of
horses
filled
the
*NL*
neighboring
streets
,
and
,
with
a
long
file
of
torches
and
a
thick
column
*NL*
of
cavaliers
,
with
free
reins
and
lances
in
rest
,
these
furious
sounds
*NL*
debouched
on
the
Place
like
a
hurricane
,
--

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
frightened
vagabonds
wheeled
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
Quasimodo
who
did
not
hear
,
saw
the
naked
swords
,
the
torches
,
the
*NL*
irons
of
the
pikes
,
all
that
cavalry
,
at
the
head
of
which
he
recognized
*NL*
Captain
Phoebus
;
he
beheld
the
confusion
of
the
outcasts
,
the
terror
*NL*
of
some
,
the
disturbance
among
the
bravest
of
them
,
and
from
this
*NL*
unexpected
succor
he
recovered
so
much
strength
,
that
he
hurled
from
the
*NL*
church
the
first
assailants
who
were
already
climbing
into
the
gallery
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
,
in
fact
,
the
king
's
troops
who
had
arrived
.
The
vagabonds
*NL*
behaved
bravely
.
They
defended
themselves
like
desperate
men
.
Caught
on
*NL*
the
flank
,
by
the
Rue
Saint-Pierre-aux-Boeufs
,
and
in
the
rear
through
*NL*
the
Rue
du
Parvis
,
driven
to
bay
against
Notre-Dame
,
which
they
*NL*
still
assailed
and
Quasimodo
defended
,
at
the
same
time
besiegers
and
*NL*
besieged
,
they
were
in
the
singular
situation
in
which
Comte
Henri
*NL*
Harcourt
,
_
Taurinum
obsessor
idem
et
obsessus
_
,
as
his
epitaph
says
,
*NL*
found
himself
later
on
,
at
the
famous
siege
of
Turin
,
in
1640
,
between
*NL*
Prince
Thomas
of
Savoy
,
whom
he
was
besieging
,
and
the
Marquis
de
*NL*
Leganez
,
who
was
blockading
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
battle
was
frightful
.
There
was
a
dog
's
tooth
for
wolf
's
flesh
,
*NL*
as
P.
Mathieu
says
.
The
king
's
cavaliers
,
in
whose
midst
Phoebus
de
*NL*
Chateaupers
bore
himself
valiantly
,
gave
no
quarter
,
and
the
slash
of
*NL*
the
sword
disposed
of
those
who
escaped
the
thrust
of
the
lance
.
The
*NL*
outcasts
,
badly
armed
foamed
and
bit
with
rage
.
Men
,
women
,
children
,
*NL*
hurled
themselves
on
the
cruppers
and
the
breasts
of
the
horses
,
and
*NL*
hung
there
like
cats
,
with
teeth
,
finger
nails
and
toe
nails
.
Others
*NL*
struck
the
archers
'
in
the
face
with
their
torches
.
Others
thrust
*NL*
iron
hooks
into
the
necks
of
the
cavaliers
and
dragged
them
down
.
They
*NL*
slashed
in
pieces
those
who
fell
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
was
noticed
who
had
a
large
,
glittering
scythe
,
and
who
,
for
a
long
*NL*
time
,
mowed
the
legs
of
the
horses
.
He
was
frightful
.
He
was
singing
*NL*
a
ditty
,
with
a
nasal
intonation
,
he
swung
and
drew
back
his
scythe
*NL*
incessantly
.
At
every
blow
he
traced
around
him
a
great
circle
of
*NL*
severed
limbs
.
He
advanced
thus
into
the
very
thickest
of
the
cavalry
,
*NL*
with
the
tranquil
slowness
,
the
lolling
of
the
head
and
the
regular
*NL*
breathing
of
a
harvester
attacking
a
field
of
wheat
.
It
was
Chopin
*NL*
Trouillefou
.
A
shot
from
an
arquebus
laid
him
low
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
windows
had
been
opened
again
.
The
neighbors
hearing
*NL*
the
war
cries
of
the
king
's
troops
,
had
mingled
in
the
affray
,
and
*NL*
bullets
rained
upon
the
outcasts
from
every
story
.
The
Parvis
was
filled
*NL*
with
a
thick
smoke
,
which
the
musketry
streaked
with
flame
.
Through
*NL*
it
one
could
confusedly
distinguish
the
front
of
Notre-Dame
,
and
the
*NL*
decrepit
Hotel-Dieu
with
some
wan
invalids
gazing
down
from
the
heights
*NL*
of
its
roof
all
checkered
with
dormer
windows
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
the
vagabonds
gave
way
.
Weariness
,
the
lack
of
good
weapons
,
*NL*
the
fright
of
this
surprise
,
the
musketry
from
the
windows
,
the
valiant
*NL*
attack
of
the
king
's
troops
,
all
overwhelmed
them
.
They
forced
the
*NL*
line
of
assailants
,
and
fled
in
every
direction
,
leaving
the
Parvis
*NL*
encumbered
with
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Quasimodo
,
who
had
not
ceased
to
fight
for
a
moment
,
beheld
*NL*
this
rout
,
he
fell
on
his
knees
and
raised
his
hands
to
heaven
;
then
,
*NL*
intoxicated
with
joy
,
he
ran
,
he
ascended
with
the
swiftness
of
a
bird
*NL*
to
that
cell
,
the
approaches
to
which
he
had
so
intrepidly
defended
.
*NL*
He
had
but
one
thought
now
;
it
was
to
kneel
before
her
whom
he
had
just
*NL*
saved
for
the
second
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
entered
the
cell
,
he
found
it
empty
.

CHAPTER
I
.
THE
LITTLE
SHOE
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
La
Esmeralda
was
sleeping
at
the
moment
when
the
outcasts
assailed
the
*NL*
church
.
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
the
ever-increasing
uproar
around
the
edifice
,
and
the
uneasy
*NL*
bleating
of
her
goat
which
had
been
awakened
,
had
roused
her
from
*NL*
her
slumbers
.
She
had
sat
up
,
she
had
listened
,
she
had
looked
;
then
,
*NL*
terrified
by
the
light
and
noise
,
she
had
rushed
from
her
cell
to
see
.
*NL*
The
aspect
of
the
Place
,
the
vision
which
was
moving
in
it
,
the
disorder
*NL*
of
that
nocturnal
assault
,
that
hideous
crowd
,
leaping
like
a
cloud
of
*NL*
frogs
,
half
seen
in
the
gloom
,
the
croaking
of
that
hoarse
multitude
,
*NL*
those
few
red
torches
running
and
crossing
each
other
in
the
darkness
*NL*
like
the
meteors
which
streak
the
misty
surfaces
of
marshes
,
this
whole
*NL*
scene
produced
upon
her
the
effect
of
a
mysterious
battle
between
the
*NL*
phantoms
of
the
witches
'
sabbath
and
the
stone
monsters
of
the
church
.
*NL*
Imbued
from
her
very
infancy
with
the
superstitions
of
the
Bohemian
*NL*
tribe
,
her
first
thought
was
that
she
had
caught
the
strange
beings
*NL*
peculiar
to
the
night
,
in
their
deeds
of
witchcraft
.
Then
she
ran
in
*NL*
terror
to
cower
in
her
cell
,
asking
of
her
pallet
some
less
terrible
*NL*
nightmare
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
little
by
little
the
first
vapors
of
terror
had
been
dissipated
;
*NL*
from
the
constantly
increasing
noise
,
and
from
many
other
signs
of
*NL*
reality
,
she
felt
herself
besieged
not
by
spectres
,
but
by
human
beings
.
*NL*
Then
her
fear
,
though
it
did
not
increase
,
changed
its
character
.
She
*NL*
had
dreamed
of
the
possibility
of
a
popular
mutiny
to
tear
her
from
her
*NL*
asylum
.
The
idea
of
once
more
recovering
life
,
hope
,
Phoebus
,
who
was
*NL*
ever
present
in
her
future
,
the
extreme
helplessness
of
her
condition
,
*NL*
flight
cut
off
,
no
support
,
her
abandonment
,
her
isolation
,
--
these
*NL*
thoughts
and
a
thousand
others
overwhelmed
her
.
She
fell
upon
her
knees
,
*NL*
with
her
head
on
her
bed
,
her
hands
clasped
over
her
head
,
full
of
*NL*
anxiety
and
tremors
,
and
,
although
a
gypsy
,
an
idolater
,
and
a
pagan
,
*NL*
she
began
to
entreat
with
sobs
,
mercy
from
the
good
Christian
God
,
and
*NL*
to
pray
to
our
Lady
,
her
hostess
.
For
even
if
one
believes
in
nothing
,
*NL*
there
are
moments
in
life
when
one
is
always
of
the
religion
of
the
*NL*
temple
which
is
nearest
at
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
remained
thus
prostrate
for
a
very
long
time
,
trembling
in
truth
,
*NL*
more
than
praying
,
chilled
by
the
ever-closer
breath
of
that
furious
*NL*
multitude
,
understanding
nothing
of
this
outburst
,
ignorant
of
what
was
*NL*
being
plotted
,
what
was
being
done
,
what
they
wanted
,
but
foreseeing
a
*NL*
terrible
issue
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
midst
of
this
anguish
,
she
heard
some
one
walking
near
her
.
She
*NL*
turned
round
.
Two
men
,
one
of
whom
carried
a
lantern
,
had
just
entered
*NL*
her
cell
.
She
uttered
a
feeble
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fear
nothing
,
''
said
a
voice
which
was
not
unknown
to
her
,
``
it
is
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
are
you
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pierre
Gringoire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
name
reassured
her
.
She
raised
her
eyes
once
more
,
and
recognized
*NL*
the
poet
in
very
fact
.
But
there
stood
beside
him
a
black
figure
veiled
*NL*
from
head
to
foot
,
which
struck
her
by
its
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
continued
Gringoire
in
a
tone
of
reproach
,
``
Djali
recognized
me
*NL*
before
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
goat
had
not
,
in
fact
,
waited
for
Gringoire
to
announce
his
*NL*
name
.
No
sooner
had
he
entered
than
it
rubbed
itself
gently
against
his
*NL*
knees
,
covering
the
poet
with
caresses
and
with
white
hairs
,
for
it
was
*NL*
shedding
its
hair
.
Gringoire
returned
the
caresses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
this
with
you
?
''
said
the
gypsy
,
in
a
low
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
at
ease
,
''
replied
Gringoire
.
''
'T
is
one
of
my
friends
.
''
Then
the
*NL*
philosopher
setting
his
lantern
on
the
ground
,
crouched
upon
the
stones
,
*NL*
and
exclaimed
enthusiastically
,
as
he
pressed
Djali
in
his
arms
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
't
is
a
graceful
beast
,
more
considerable
no
doubt
,
for
it
's
*NL*
neatness
than
for
its
size
,
but
ingenious
,
subtle
,
and
lettered
as
a
*NL*
grammarian
!
Let
us
see
,
my
Djali
,
hast
thou
forgotten
any
of
thy
pretty
*NL*
tricks
?
How
does
Master
Jacques
Charmolue
?
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
in
black
did
not
allow
him
to
finish
.
He
approached
Gringoire
*NL*
and
shook
him
roughly
by
the
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gringoire
rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
true
,
''
said
he
:
``
I
forgot
that
we
are
in
haste
.
But
that
is
no
*NL*
reason
master
,
for
getting
furious
with
people
in
this
manner
.
My
dear
*NL*
and
lovely
child
,
your
life
is
in
danger
,
and
Djali
's
also
.
They
want
*NL*
to
hang
you
again
.
We
are
your
friends
,
and
we
have
come
to
save
you
.
*NL*
Follow
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
true
?
''
she
exclaimed
in
dismay
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
perfectly
true
.
Come
quickly
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
willing
,
''
she
stammered
.
``
But
why
does
not
your
friend
speak
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
Gringoire
,
''
't
is
because
his
father
and
mother
were
fantastic
*NL*
people
who
made
him
of
a
taciturn
temperament
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
obliged
to
content
herself
with
this
explanation
.
Gringoire
took
*NL*
her
by
the
hand
;
his
companion
picked
up
the
lantern
and
walked
on
in
*NL*
front
.
Fear
stunned
the
young
girl
.
She
allowed
herself
to
be
led
away
.
*NL*
The
goat
followed
them
,
frisking
,
so
joyous
at
seeing
Gringoire
again
*NL*
that
it
made
him
stumble
every
moment
by
thrusting
its
horns
between
his
*NL*
legs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Such
is
life
,
''
said
the
philosopher
,
every
time
that
he
came
*NL*
near
falling
down
;
''
't
is
often
our
best
friends
who
cause
us
to
be
*NL*
overthrown
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
rapidly
descended
the
staircase
of
the
towers
,
crossed
the
church
,
*NL*
full
of
shadows
and
solitude
,
and
all
reverberating
with
uproar
,
which
*NL*
formed
a
frightful
contrast
,
and
emerged
into
the
courtyard
of
the
*NL*
cloister
by
the
red
door
.
The
cloister
was
deserted
;
the
canons
had
*NL*
fled
to
the
bishop
's
palace
in
order
to
pray
together
;
the
courtyard
*NL*
was
empty
,
a
few
frightened
lackeys
were
crouching
in
dark
corners
.
They
*NL*
directed
their
steps
towards
the
door
which
opened
from
this
court
upon
*NL*
the
Terrain
.
The
man
in
black
opened
it
with
a
key
which
he
had
about
*NL*
him
.
Our
readers
are
aware
that
the
Terrain
was
a
tongue
of
land
*NL*
enclosed
by
walls
on
the
side
of
the
City
and
belonging
to
the
chapter
*NL*
of
Notre-Dame
,
which
terminated
the
island
on
the
east
,
behind
the
*NL*
church
.
They
found
this
enclosure
perfectly
deserted
.
There
was
here
*NL*
less
tumult
in
the
air
.
The
roar
of
the
outcasts
'
assault
reached
them
*NL*
more
confusedly
and
less
clamorously
.
The
fresh
breeze
which
follows
the
*NL*
current
of
a
stream
,
rustled
the
leaves
of
the
only
tree
planted
on
the
*NL*
point
of
the
Terrain
,
with
a
noise
that
was
already
perceptible
.
But
*NL*
they
were
still
very
close
to
danger
.
The
nearest
edifices
to
them
were
*NL*
the
bishop
's
palace
and
the
church
.
It
was
plainly
evident
that
there
*NL*
was
great
internal
commotion
in
the
bishop
's
palace
.
Its
shadowy
mass
*NL*
was
all
furrowed
with
lights
which
flitted
from
window
to
window
;
as
,
*NL*
when
one
has
just
burned
paper
,
there
remains
a
sombre
edifice
of
ashes
*NL*
in
which
bright
sparks
run
a
thousand
eccentric
courses
.
Beside
them
,
*NL*
the
enormous
towers
of
Notre-Dame
,
thus
viewed
from
behind
,
with
the
*NL*
long
nave
above
which
they
rise
cut
out
in
black
against
the
red
and
*NL*
vast
light
which
filled
the
Parvis
,
resembled
two
gigantic
andirons
of
*NL*
some
cyclopean
fire-grate
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
to
be
seen
of
Paris
on
all
sides
wavered
before
the
eye
in
*NL*
a
gloom
mingled
with
light
.
Rembrandt
has
such
backgrounds
to
his
*NL*
pictures
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
with
the
lantern
walked
straight
to
the
point
of
the
Terrain
.
*NL*
There
,
at
the
very
brink
of
the
water
,
stood
the
wormeaten
remains
of
a
*NL*
fence
of
posts
latticed
with
laths
,
whereon
a
low
vine
spread
out
a
*NL*
few
thin
branches
like
the
fingers
of
an
outspread
hand
.
Behind
,
in
the
*NL*
shadow
cast
by
this
trellis
,
a
little
boat
lay
concealed
.
The
man
made
*NL*
a
sign
to
Gringoire
and
his
companion
to
enter
.
The
goat
followed
them
.
*NL*
The
man
was
the
last
to
step
in
.
Then
he
cut
the
boat
's
moorings
,
pushed
*NL*
it
from
the
shore
with
a
long
boat-hook
,
and
,
seizing
two
oars
,
seated
*NL*
himself
in
the
bow
,
rowing
with
all
his
might
towards
midstream
.
The
*NL*
Seine
is
very
rapid
at
this
point
,
and
he
had
a
good
deal
of
trouble
in
*NL*
leaving
the
point
of
the
island
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gringoire
's
first
care
on
entering
the
boat
was
to
place
the
goat
on
*NL*
his
knees
.
He
took
a
position
in
the
stern
;
and
the
young
girl
,
whom
the
*NL*
stranger
inspired
with
an
indefinable
uneasiness
,
seated
herself
close
*NL*
to
the
poet
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
our
philosopher
felt
the
boat
sway
,
he
clapped
his
hands
and
kissed
*NL*
Djali
between
the
horns
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
said
he
,
``
now
we
are
safe
,
all
four
of
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
added
with
the
air
of
a
profound
thinker
,
``
One
is
indebted
*NL*
sometimes
to
fortune
,
sometimes
to
ruse
,
for
the
happy
issue
of
great
*NL*
enterprises
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
boat
made
its
way
slowly
towards
the
right
shore
.
The
young
girl
*NL*
watched
the
unknown
man
with
secret
terror
.
He
had
carefully
turned
off
*NL*
the
light
of
his
dark
lantern
.
A
glimpse
could
be
caught
of
him
in
the
*NL*
obscurity
,
in
the
bow
of
the
boat
,
like
a
spectre
.
His
cowl
,
which
was
*NL*
still
lowered
,
formed
a
sort
of
mask
;
and
every
time
that
he
spread
his
*NL*
arms
,
upon
which
hung
large
black
sleeves
,
as
he
rowed
,
one
would
have
*NL*
said
they
were
two
huge
bat
's
wings
.
Moreover
,
he
had
not
yet
uttered
a
*NL*
word
or
breathed
a
syllable
.
No
other
noise
was
heard
in
the
boat
than
*NL*
the
splashing
of
the
oars
,
mingled
with
the
rippling
of
the
water
along
*NL*
her
sides
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
my
soul
!
''
exclaimed
Gringoire
suddenly
,
``
we
are
as
cheerful
and
*NL*
joyous
as
young
owls
!
We
preserve
the
silence
of
Pythagoreans
or
fishes
!
*NL*
_
Pasque-Dieu
_
!
my
friends
,
I
should
greatly
like
to
have
some
one
speak
*NL*
to
me
.
The
human
voice
is
music
to
the
human
ear
.
'T
is
not
I
who
*NL*
say
that
,
but
Didymus
of
Alexandria
,
and
they
are
illustrious
words
.
*NL*
Assuredly
,
Didymus
of
Alexandria
is
no
mediocre
philosopher
.
--
One
word
,
*NL*
my
lovely
child
!
say
but
one
word
to
me
,
I
entreat
you
.
By
the
way
,
you
*NL*
had
a
droll
and
peculiar
little
pout
;
do
you
still
make
it
?
Do
you
*NL*
know
,
my
dear
,
that
parliament
hath
full
jurisdiction
over
all
places
of
*NL*
asylum
,
and
that
you
were
running
a
great
risk
in
your
little
chamber
at
*NL*
Notre-Dame
?
Alas
!
the
little
bird
trochylus
maketh
its
nest
in
the
jaws
*NL*
of
the
crocodile
.
--
Master
,
here
is
the
moon
re-appearing
.
If
only
*NL*
they
do
not
perceive
us
.
We
are
doing
a
laudable
thing
in
saving
*NL*
mademoiselle
,
and
yet
we
should
be
hung
by
order
of
the
king
if
we
were
*NL*
caught
.
Alas
!
human
actions
are
taken
by
two
handles
.
That
is
branded
*NL*
with
disgrace
in
one
which
is
crowned
in
another
.
He
admires
Cicero
who
*NL*
blames
Catiline
.
Is
it
not
so
,
master
?
What
say
you
to
this
*NL*
philosophy
?
I
possess
philosophy
by
instinct
,
by
nature
,
_
ut
apes
*NL*

_
.
--
Come
!
no
one
answers
me
.
What
unpleasant
moods
you
two
are
*NL*
in
!
I
must
do
all
the
talking
alone
.
That
is
what
we
call
a
monologue
*NL*
in
tragedy
.
--
_
Pasque-Dieu
_
!
I
must
inform
you
that
I
have
just
seen
*NL*
the
king
,
Louis
XI.
,
and
that
I
have
caught
this
oath
from
*NL*
him
,
--
_
Pasque-Dieu
_
!
They
are
still
making
a
hearty
howl
in
the
*NL*
city
.
--
'T
is
a
villanous
,
malicious
old
king
.
He
is
all
swathed
in
furs
.
*NL*
He
still
owes
me
the
money
for
my
epithalamium
,
and
he
came
within
a
*NL*
nick
of
hanging
me
this
evening
,
which
would
have
been
very
inconvenient
*NL*
to
me
.
--
He
is
niggardly
towards
men
of
merit
.
He
ought
to
read
the
four
*NL*
books
of
Salvien
of
Cologne
,
_
Adversits
Avaritiam
_
.
In
truth
!
'T
is
a
*NL*
paltry
king
in
his
ways
with
men
of
letters
,
and
one
who
commits
very
*NL*
barbarous
cruelties
.
He
is
a
sponge
,
to
soak
money
raised
from
the
*NL*
people
.
His
saving
is
like
the
spleen
which
swelleth
with
the
leanness
*NL*
of
all
the
other
members
.
Hence
complaints
against
the
hardness
of
the
*NL*
times
become
murmurs
against
the
prince
.
Under
this
gentle
and
pious
*NL*
sire
,
the
gallows
crack
with
the
hung
,
the
blocks
rot
with
blood
,
the
*NL*
prisons
burst
like
over
full
bellies
.
This
king
hath
one
hand
which
*NL*
grasps
,
and
one
which
hangs
.
He
is
the
procurator
of
Dame
Tax
and
*NL*
Monsieur
Gibbet
.
The
great
are
despoiled
of
their
dignities
,
and
*NL*
the
little
incessantly
overwhelmed
with
fresh
oppressions
.
He
is
an
*NL*
exorbitant
prince
.
I
love
not
this
monarch
.
And
you
,
master
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
in
black
let
the
garrulous
poet
chatter
on
.
He
continued
to
*NL*
struggle
against
the
violent
and
narrow
current
,
which
separates
the
*NL*
prow
of
the
City
and
the
stem
of
the
island
of
Notre-Dame
,
which
we
call
*NL*
to-day
the
Isle
St.
Louis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
way
,
master
!
''
continued
Gringoire
suddenly
.
``
At
the
moment
*NL*
when
we
arrived
on
the
Parvis
,
through
the
enraged
outcasts
,
did
your
*NL*
reverence
observe
that
poor
little
devil
whose
skull
your
deaf
man
was
*NL*
just
cracking
on
the
railing
of
the
gallery
of
the
kings
?
I
am
near
*NL*
sighted
and
I
could
not
recognize
him
.
Do
you
know
who
he
could
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
stranger
answered
not
a
word
.
But
he
suddenly
ceased
rowing
,
*NL*
his
arms
fell
as
though
broken
,
his
head
sank
on
his
breast
,
and
la
*NL*
Esmeralda
heard
him
sigh
convulsively
.
She
shuddered
.
She
had
heard
such
*NL*
sighs
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boat
,
abandoned
to
itself
,
floated
for
several
minutes
with
the
*NL*
stream
.
But
the
man
in
black
finally
recovered
himself
,
seized
the
oars
*NL*
once
more
and
began
to
row
against
the
current
.
He
doubled
the
point
of
*NL*
the
Isle
of
Notre
Dame
,
and
made
for
the
landing-place
of
the
Port
an
*NL*
Foin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
Gringoire
,
``
yonder
is
the
Barbeau
mansion
.
--
Stay
,
master
,
*NL*
look
:
that
group
of
black
roofs
which
make
such
singular
angles
yonder
,
*NL*
above
that
heap
of
black
,
fibrous
grimy
,
dirty
clouds
,
where
the
moon
is
*NL*
completely
crushed
and
spread
out
like
the
yolk
of
an
egg
whose
shell
*NL*
is
broken
.
--
'T
is
a
fine
mansion
.
There
is
a
chapel
crowned
with
a
small
*NL*
vault
full
of
very
well
carved
enrichments
.
Above
,
you
can
see
the
bell
*NL*
tower
,
very
delicately
pierced
.
There
is
also
a
pleasant
garden
,
which
*NL*
consists
of
a
pond
,
an
aviary
,
an
echo
,
a
mall
,
a
labyrinth
,
a
house
*NL*
for
wild
beasts
,
and
a
quantity
of
leafy
alleys
very
agreeable
to
Venus
.
*NL*
There
is
also
a
rascal
of
a
tree
which
is
called
`
the
lewd
,
'
because
it
*NL*
favored
the
pleasures
of
a
famous
princess
and
a
constable
of
France
,
*NL*
who
was
a
gallant
and
a
wit
.
--
Alas
!
we
poor
philosophers
are
to
a
*NL*
constable
as
a
plot
of
cabbages
or
a
radish
bed
to
the
garden
of
the
*NL*
Louvre
.
What
matters
it
,
after
all
?
human
life
,
for
the
great
as
well
*NL*
as
for
us
,
is
a
mixture
of
good
and
evil
.
Pain
is
always
by
the
side
*NL*
of
joy
,
the
spondee
by
the
dactyl
.
--
Master
,
I
must
relate
to
you
the
*NL*
history
of
the
Barbeau
mansion
.
It
ends
in
tragic
fashion
.
It
was
in
*NL*
1319
,
in
the
reign
of
Philippe
V.
,
the
longest
reign
of
the
kings
of
*NL*
France
.
The
moral
of
the
story
is
that
the
temptations
of
the
flesh
are
*NL*
pernicious
and
malignant
.
Let
us
not
rest
our
glance
too
long
on
our
*NL*
neighbor
's
wife
,
however
gratified
our
senses
may
be
by
her
beauty
.
*NL*
Fornication
is
a
very
libertine
thought
.
Adultery
is
a
prying
into
the
*NL*
pleasures
of
others
--
Ohe
!
the
noise
yonder
is
redoubling
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
tumult
around
Notre-Dame
was
,
in
fact
,
increasing
.
They
listened
.
*NL*
Cries
of
victory
were
heard
with
tolerable
distinctness
.
All
at
once
,
a
*NL*
hundred
torches
,
the
light
of
which
glittered
upon
the
helmets
of
men
*NL*
at
arms
,
spread
over
the
church
at
all
heights
,
on
the
towers
,
on
the
*NL*
galleries
,
on
the
flying
buttresses
.
These
torches
seemed
to
be
in
*NL*
search
of
something
;
and
soon
distant
clamors
reached
the
fugitives
*NL*
distinctly
:
--
``
The
gypsy
!
the
sorceress
!
death
to
the
gypsy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
unhappy
girl
dropped
her
head
upon
her
hands
,
and
the
unknown
began
*NL*
to
row
furiously
towards
the
shore
.
Meanwhile
our
philosopher
reflected
.
*NL*
He
clasped
the
goat
in
his
arms
,
and
gently
drew
away
from
the
gypsy
,
*NL*
who
pressed
closer
and
closer
to
him
,
as
though
to
the
only
asylum
which
*NL*
remained
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
certain
that
Gringoire
was
enduring
cruel
perplexity
.
He
was
*NL*
thinking
that
the
goat
also
,
``
according
to
existing
law
,
''
would
be
hung
*NL*
if
recaptured
;
which
would
be
a
great
pity
,
poor
Djali
!
that
he
had
thus
*NL*
two
condemned
creatures
attached
to
him
;
that
his
companion
asked
no
*NL*
better
than
to
take
charge
of
the
gypsy
.
A
violent
combat
began
between
*NL*
his
thoughts
,
in
which
,
like
the
Jupiter
of
the
Iliad
,
he
weighed
in
*NL*
turn
the
gypsy
and
the
goat
;
and
he
looked
at
them
alternately
with
eyes
*NL*
moist
with
tears
,
saying
between
his
teeth
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
can
not
save
you
both
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
shock
informed
them
that
the
boat
had
reached
the
land
at
last
.
The
*NL*
uproar
still
filled
the
city
.
The
unknown
rose
,
approached
the
gypsy
,
*NL*
and
endeavored
to
take
her
arm
to
assist
her
to
alight
.
She
repulsed
him
*NL*
and
clung
to
the
sleeve
of
Gringoire
,
who
,
in
his
turn
,
absorbed
in
the
*NL*
goat
,
almost
repulsed
her
.
Then
she
sprang
alone
from
the
boat
.
She
was
*NL*
so
troubled
that
she
did
not
know
what
she
did
or
whither
she
was
going
.
*NL*
Thus
she
remained
for
a
moment
,
stunned
,
watching
the
water
flow
past
;
*NL*
when
she
gradually
returned
to
her
senses
,
she
found
herself
alone
*NL*
on
the
wharf
with
the
unknown
.
It
appears
that
Gringoire
had
taken
*NL*
advantage
of
the
moment
of
debarcation
to
slip
away
with
the
goat
into
*NL*
the
block
of
houses
of
the
Rue
Grenier-sur-l'Eau
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
gypsy
shivered
when
she
beheld
herself
alone
with
this
man
.
She
*NL*
tried
to
speak
,
to
cry
out
,
to
call
Gringoire
;
her
tongue
was
dumb
*NL*
in
her
mouth
,
and
no
sound
left
her
lips
.
All
at
once
she
felt
*NL*
the
stranger
's
hand
on
hers
.
It
was
a
strong
,
cold
hand
.
Her
teeth
*NL*
chattered
,
she
turned
paler
than
the
ray
of
moonlight
which
illuminated
*NL*
her
.
The
man
spoke
not
a
word
.
He
began
to
ascend
towards
the
Place
de
*NL*
Greve
,
holding
her
by
the
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
,
she
had
a
vague
feeling
that
destiny
is
an
irresistible
*NL*
force
.
She
had
no
more
resistance
left
in
her
,
she
allowed
herself
to
be
*NL*
dragged
along
,
running
while
he
walked
.
At
this
spot
the
quay
ascended
.
*NL*
But
it
seemed
to
her
as
though
she
were
descending
a
slope
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
gazed
about
her
on
all
sides
.
Not
a
single
passer-by
.
The
quay
was
*NL*
absolutely
deserted
.
She
heard
no
sound
,
she
felt
no
people
moving
save
*NL*
in
the
tumultuous
and
glowing
city
,
from
which
she
was
separated
only
by
*NL*
an
arm
of
the
Seine
,
and
whence
her
name
reached
her
,
mingled
with
cries
*NL*
of
``
Death
!
''
The
rest
of
Paris
was
spread
around
her
in
great
blocks
of
*NL*
shadows
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
the
stranger
continued
to
drag
her
along
with
the
same
*NL*
silence
and
the
same
rapidity
.
She
had
no
recollection
of
any
of
the
*NL*
places
where
she
was
walking
.
As
she
passed
before
a
lighted
window
,
she
*NL*
made
an
effort
,
drew
up
suddenly
,
and
cried
out
,
``
Help
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
bourgeois
who
was
standing
at
the
window
opened
it
,
appeared
there
*NL*
in
his
shirt
with
his
lamp
,
stared
at
the
quay
with
a
stupid
air
,
*NL*
uttered
some
words
which
she
did
not
understand
,
and
closed
his
shutter
*NL*
again
.
It
was
her
last
gleam
of
hope
extinguished
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
in
black
did
not
utter
a
syllable
;
he
held
her
firmly
,
and
set
*NL*
out
again
at
a
quicker
pace
.
She
no
longer
resisted
,
but
followed
him
,
*NL*
completely
broken
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
time
to
time
she
called
together
a
little
strength
,
and
said
,
in
a
*NL*
voice
broken
by
the
unevenness
of
the
pavement
and
the
breathlessness
of
*NL*
their
flight
,
``
Who
are
you
?
Who
are
you
?
''
He
made
no
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
arrived
thus
,
still
keeping
along
the
quay
,
at
a
tolerably
spacious
*NL*
square
.
It
was
the
Greve
.
In
the
middle
,
a
sort
of
black
,
erect
cross
*NL*
was
visible
;
it
was
the
gallows
.
She
recognized
all
this
,
and
saw
where
*NL*
she
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
halted
,
turned
towards
her
and
raised
his
cowl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
she
stammered
,
almost
petrified
,
``
I
knew
well
that
it
was
he
*NL*
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
priest
.
He
looked
like
the
ghost
of
himself
;
that
is
an
*NL*
effect
of
the
moonlight
,
it
seems
as
though
one
beheld
only
the
spectres
*NL*
of
things
in
that
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
!
''
he
said
to
her
;
and
she
shuddered
at
the
sound
of
that
fatal
*NL*
voice
which
she
had
not
heard
for
a
long
time
.
He
continued
speaking
*NL*
with
those
brief
and
panting
jerks
,
which
betoken
deep
internal
*NL*
convulsions
.
``
Listen
!
we
are
here
.
I
am
going
to
speak
to
you
.
This
is
*NL*
the
Greve
.
This
is
an
extreme
point
.
Destiny
gives
us
to
one
another
.
I
*NL*
am
going
to
decide
as
to
your
life
;
you
will
decide
as
to
my
soul
.
Here
*NL*
is
a
place
,
here
is
a
night
beyond
which
one
sees
nothing
.
Then
listen
*NL*
to
me
.
I
am
going
to
tell
you
...
In
the
first
place
,
speak
not
to
me
*NL*
of
your
Phoebus
.
-LRB-
As
he
spoke
thus
he
paced
to
and
fro
,
like
a
man
who
*NL*
can
not
remain
in
one
place
,
and
dragged
her
after
him
.
-RRB-
Do
not
speak
to
*NL*
me
of
him
.
Do
you
see
?
If
you
utter
that
name
,
I
know
not
what
I
shall
*NL*
do
,
but
it
will
be
terrible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
like
a
body
which
recovers
its
centre
of
gravity
,
he
became
*NL*
motionless
once
more
,
but
his
words
betrayed
no
less
agitation
.
His
*NL*
voice
grew
lower
and
lower
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
turn
your
head
aside
thus
.
Listen
to
me
.
It
is
a
serious
matter
.
*NL*
In
the
first
place
,
here
is
what
has
happened
.
--
All
this
will
not
be
*NL*
laughed
at
.
I
swear
it
to
you
.
--
What
was
I
saying
?
Remind
me
!
Oh
!
--
There
*NL*
is
a
decree
of
Parliament
which
gives
you
back
to
the
scaffold
.
I
have
*NL*
just
rescued
you
from
their
hands
.
But
they
are
pursuing
you
.
Look
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
extended
his
arm
toward
the
City
.
The
search
seemed
,
in
fact
,
to
*NL*
be
still
in
progress
there
.
The
uproar
drew
nearer
;
the
tower
of
the
*NL*
lieutenant
's
house
,
situated
opposite
the
Greve
,
was
full
of
clamors
*NL*
and
light
,
and
soldiers
could
be
seen
running
on
the
opposite
quay
with
*NL*
torches
and
these
cries
,
``
The
gypsy
!
Where
is
the
gypsy
!
Death
!
Death
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
that
they
are
in
pursuit
of
you
,
and
that
I
am
not
lying
to
*NL*
you
.
I
love
you
.
--
Do
not
open
your
mouth
;
refrain
from
speaking
to
me
*NL*
rather
,
if
it
be
only
to
tell
me
that
you
hate
me
.
I
have
made
up
my
*NL*
mind
not
to
hear
that
again
.
--
I
have
just
saved
you
.
--
Let
me
finish
*NL*
first
.
I
can
save
you
wholly
.
I
have
prepared
everything
.
It
is
yours
at
*NL*
will
.
If
you
wish
,
I
can
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
broke
off
violently
.
``
No
,
that
is
not
what
I
should
say
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
went
with
hurried
step
and
made
her
hurry
also
,
for
he
did
not
*NL*
release
her
,
he
walked
straight
to
the
gallows
,
and
pointed
to
it
with
*NL*
his
finger
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Choose
between
us
two
,
''
he
said
,
coldly
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
tore
herself
from
his
hands
and
fell
at
the
foot
of
the
gibbet
,
*NL*
embracing
that
funereal
support
,
then
she
half
turned
her
beautiful
*NL*
head
,
and
looked
at
the
priest
over
her
shoulder
.
One
would
have
said
*NL*
that
she
was
a
Holy
Virgin
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
.
The
priest
remained
*NL*
motionless
,
his
finger
still
raised
toward
the
gibbet
,
preserving
his
*NL*
attitude
like
a
statue
.
At
length
the
gypsy
said
to
him
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
causes
me
less
horror
than
you
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
allowed
his
arm
to
sink
slowly
,
and
gazed
at
the
pavement
in
*NL*
profound
dejection
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
these
stones
could
speak
,
''
he
murmured
,
``
yes
,
they
would
say
that
a
*NL*
*
very
unhappy
man
stands
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
on
.
The
young
girl
,
kneeling
before
the
gallows
,
enveloped
in
*NL*
her
long
flowing
hair
,
let
him
speak
on
without
interruption
.
He
now
had
*NL*
a
gentle
and
plaintive
accent
which
contrasted
sadly
with
the
haughty
*NL*
harshness
of
his
features
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
love
you
.
Oh
!
how
true
that
is
!
So
nothing
comes
of
that
fire
which
*NL*
burns
my
heart
!
Alas
!
young
girl
,
night
and
day
--
yes
,
night
and
day
I
*NL*
tell
you
,
--
it
is
torture
.
Oh
!
I
suffer
too
much
,
my
poor
child
.
'T
is
a
*NL*
thing
deserving
of
compassion
,
I
assure
you
.
You
see
that
I
speak
gently
*NL*
to
you
.
I
really
wish
that
you
should
no
longer
cherish
this
horror
*NL*
of
me
.
--
After
all
,
if
a
man
loves
a
woman
,
't
is
not
his
fault
!
--
Oh
,
my
*NL*
God
!
--
What
!
So
you
will
never
pardon
me
?
You
will
always
hate
me
?
All
is
*NL*
over
then
.
It
is
that
which
renders
me
evil
,
do
you
see
?
and
horrible
*NL*
to
myself
.
--
You
will
not
even
look
at
me
!
You
are
thinking
of
something
*NL*
else
,
perchance
,
while
I
stand
here
and
talk
to
you
,
shuddering
on
the
*NL*
brink
of
eternity
for
both
of
us
!
Above
all
things
,
do
not
speak
to
me
*NL*
of
the
officer
!
--
I
would
cast
myself
at
your
knees
,
I
would
kiss
not
*NL*
your
feet
,
but
the
earth
which
is
under
your
feet
;
I
would
sob
like
*NL*
a
child
,
I
would
tear
from
my
breast
not
words
,
but
my
very
heart
and
*NL*
vitals
,
to
tell
you
that
I
love
you
;
--
all
would
be
useless
,
all
!
--
And
*NL*
yet
you
have
nothing
in
your
heart
but
what
is
tender
and
merciful
.
*NL*
You
are
radiant
with
the
most
beautiful
mildness
;
you
are
wholly
sweet
,
*NL*
good
,
pitiful
,
and
charming
.
Alas
!
You
cherish
no
ill
will
for
any
one
*NL*
but
me
alone
!
Oh
!
what
a
fatality
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
.
The
young
girl
heard
him
weeping
.
It
was
*NL*
for
the
first
time
.
Thus
erect
and
shaken
by
sobs
,
he
was
more
*NL*
miserable
and
more
suppliant
than
when
on
his
knees
.
He
wept
thus
for
a
*NL*
considerable
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
!
''
he
said
,
these
first
tears
passed
,
``
I
have
no
more
words
.
I
had
,
*NL*
however
,
thought
well
as
to
what
you
would
say

Now
I
tremble
and
shiver
*NL*
and
break
down
at
the
decisive
moment
,
I
feel
conscious
of
something
*NL*
supreme
enveloping
us
,
and
I
stammer
.
Oh
!
I
shall
fall
upon
the
pavement
*NL*
if
you
do
not
take
pity
on
me
,
pity
on
yourself

Do
not
condemn
us
both

*NL*
If
you
only
knew
how
much
I
love
you
!
What
a
heart
is
mine
!
Oh
!
what
*NL*
desertion
of
all
virtue
!
What
desperate
abandonment
of
myself
!
A
doctor
,
*NL*
I
mock
at
science
;
a
gentleman
,
I
tarnish
my
own
name

a
priest

I
make
*NL*
of
the
missal
a
pillow

sensuality

spit
in

face

my
God

all
*NL*
this
for
thee

enchantress

be
more
worthy

thy
hell

And
you
will
*NL*
not
have
the
apostate

Oh

let
me
tell
you
all

more
still
,
something
*NL*
more
horrible
,
oh

Yet
more
horrible
!

''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
uttered
these
last
words
,
his
air
became
utterly
distracted
.
He
*NL*
was
silent
for
a
moment
,
and
resumed
,
as
though
speaking
to
himself
,
and
*NL*
in
a
strong
voice
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cain
,
what
hast
thou
done
with
thy
brother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
another
silence
,
and
he
went
on
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
I
done
with
him
,
Lord
?
I
received
him
,
I
reared
him

I
*NL*
nourished
him
,
I
loved
him

I
idolized
him
,
and
I
have
slain
him
!
Yes
,
*NL*
Lord
,
they
have
just
dashed
his
head
before
my
eyes
on
the
stone
of
*NL*
thine
house
,
and
it
is
because
of
me
,
because
of
this
woman
,
because
of
*NL*
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
eye
was
wild
.
His
voice
grew
ever
weaker
;
he
repeated
many
times
,
*NL*
yet
,
mechanically
,
at
tolerably
long
intervals
,
like
a
bell
prolonging
*NL*
its
last
vibration
:
``
Because
of
her
.
--
Because
of
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
his
tongue
no
longer
articulated
any
perceptible
sound
;
but
*NL*
his
lips
still
moved
.
All
at
once
he
sank
together
,
like
something
*NL*
crumbling
,
and
lay
motionless
on
the
earth
,
with
his
head
on
his
knees
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
touch
from
the
young
girl
,
as
she
drew
her
foot
from
under
him
,
*NL*
brought
him
to
himself
.
He
passed
his
hand
slowly
over
his
hollow
*NL*
cheeks
,
and
gazed
for
several
moments
at
his
fingers
,
which
were
wet
,
*NL*
``
What
!
''
he
murmured
,
``
I
have
wept
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
turning
suddenly
to
the
gypsy
with
unspeakable
anguish
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas

you
have
looked
coldly
on
at
my
tears

Child
,
do
you
know
that
*NL*
those
tears
are
of
lava
?
Is
it
indeed
true
?
Nothing
touches
when
it
*NL*
comes
from
the
man
whom
one
does
not
love
.
If
you
were
to
see
me
die
,
*NL*
you
would
laugh

Oh

I
do
not
wish
to
see
you
die

One

A
single
*NL*
word
of
pardon

Say
not

you
love
me

say
only
that
you
will
do
it
;
*NL*
that
will
suffice
;
I
will
save
you

If
not

oh

the
hour
is
passing

I
*NL*
entreat
you
by
all
that
is
sacred
,
do
not
wait
until
I
shall
have
turned
*NL*
to
stone
again

like
that
gibbet
which
also
claims
you

Reflect
that

I
hold
the
destinies
of
both
of
us
in
my
hand

that
I
am
mad

it
is
*NL*
terrible

that
I
may
let
all
go
to
destruction

and
that
there
is
*NL*
beneath
us
a
bottomless
abyss
,
unhappy
girl
,
whither
my
fall
will
follow
*NL*
yours
to
all
eternity

One
word
of
kindness
!
Say
one
word

only
one
*NL*
word
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
opened
her
mouth
to
answer
him
.
He
flung
himself
on
his
knees
to
*NL*
receive
with
adoration
the
word
,
possibly
a
tender
one
,
which
was
on
the
*NL*
point
of
issuing
from
her
lips
.
She
said
to
him
,
``
You
are
an
assassin

*NL*
*NL*
The
priest
clasped
her
in
his
arms
with
fury
,
and
began
to
laugh
with
an
*NL*
abominable
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
yes
,
an
assassin
!
''
he
said
,
``
and
I
will
have
you

You

not

Come

*NL*

The
tomb

''
*NL*
*NL*
His
eyes
sparkled
with
impurity
and
rage
.
His
lewd
lips
reddened
the
*NL*
young
girl
's
neck
.
She
struggled
in
his
arms
.
He
covered
her
with
*NL*
furious
kisses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
bite
me
,
monster
!
''
she
cried
.
``
Oh
!
the
foul
,
odious
monk
!
leave
*NL*
me
!
I
will
tear
out
thy
ugly
gray
hair
and
fling
it
in
thy
face
by
the
*NL*
handful
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
reddened
,
turned
pale
,
then
released
her
and
gazed
at
her
with
a
*NL*
gloomy
air
.
She
thought
herself
victorious
,
and
continued
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
that
I
belong
to
my
Phoebus
,
that
't
is
Phoebus
whom
I
love
,
*NL*
that
't
is
Phoebus
who
is
handsome
!
you
are
old
,
priest
!
you
are
ugly
!
*NL*
Begone
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
gave
vent
to
a
horrible
cry
,
like
the
wretch
to
whom
a
hot
iron
is
*NL*
applied
.
``
Die
,
then
!
''
he
said
,
gnashing
his
teeth
.
She
saw
his
terrible
*NL*
look
and
tried
to
fly
.
He
caught
her
once
more
,
he
shook
her
,
he
flung
*NL*
her
on
the
ground
,
and
walked
with
rapid
strides
towards
the
corner
*NL*
of
the
Tour-Roland
,
dragging
her
after
him
along
the
pavement
by
her
*NL*
beautiful
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
arriving
there
,
he
turned
to
her
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
the
last
time
,
will
you
be
mine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
replied
with
emphasis
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
cried
in
a
loud
voice
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gudule
!
Gudule
!
here
is
the
gypsy
!
take
your
vengeance
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
girl
felt
herself
seized
suddenly
by
the
elbow
.
She
looked
.
*NL*
A
fleshless
arm
was
stretched
from
an
opening
in
the
wall
,
and
held
her
*NL*
like
a
hand
of
iron
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
her
well
,
''
said
the
priest
;
''
't
is
the
gypsy
escaped
.
Release
her
*NL*
not
.
I
will
go
in
search
of
the
sergeants
.
You
shall
see
her
hanged
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
guttural
laugh
replied
from
the
interior
of
the
wall
to
these
bloody
*NL*
words
--
``
Hah
!
hah
!
hah
!
''
--
The
gypsy
watched
the
priest
retire
in
*NL*
the
direction
of
the
Pont
Notre-Dame
.
A
cavalcade
was
heard
in
that
*NL*
direction
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
girl
had
recognized
the
spiteful
recluse
.
Panting
with
terror
,
*NL*
she
tried
to
disengage
herself
.
She
writhed
,
she
made
many
starts
of
*NL*
agony
and
despair
,
but
the
other
held
her
with
incredible
strength
.
The
*NL*
lean
and
bony
fingers
which
bruised
her
,
clenched
on
her
flesh
and
met
*NL*
around
it
.
One
would
have
said
that
this
hand
was
riveted
to
her
arm
.
It
*NL*
was
more
than
a
chain
,
more
than
a
fetter
,
more
than
a
ring
of
iron
,
it
*NL*
was
a
living
pair
of
pincers
endowed
with
intelligence
,
which
emerged
*NL*
from
the
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
fell
back
against
the
wall
exhausted
,
and
then
the
fear
of
death
*NL*
took
possession
of
her
.
She
thought
of
the
beauty
of
life
,
of
youth
,
of
*NL*
the
view
of
heaven
,
the
aspects
of
nature
,
of
her
love
for
Phoebus
,
of
*NL*
all
that
was
vanishing
and
all
that
was
approaching
,
of
the
priest
who
*NL*
was
denouncing
her
,
of
the
headsman
who
was
to
come
,
of
the
gallows
*NL*
which
was
there
.
Then
she
felt
terror
mount
to
the
very
roots
of
her
*NL*
hair
and
she
heard
the
mocking
laugh
of
the
recluse
,
saying
to
her
in
a
*NL*
very
low
tone
:
``
Hah
!
hah
!
hah
!
you
are
going
to
be
hanged
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
a
dying
look
towards
the
window
,
and
she
beheld
the
fierce
*NL*
face
of
the
sacked
nun
through
the
bars
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
I
done
to
you
?
''
she
said
,
almost
lifeless
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
recluse
did
not
reply
,
but
began
to
mumble
with
a
singsong
*NL*
irritated
,
mocking
intonation
:
``
Daughter
of
Egypt
!
daughter
of
Egypt
!
*NL*
daughter
of
Egypt
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
unhappy
Esmeralda
dropped
her
head
beneath
her
flowing
hair
,
*NL*
comprehending
that
it
was
no
human
being
she
had
to
deal
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
the
recluse
exclaimed
,
as
though
the
gypsy
's
question
had
*NL*
taken
all
this
time
to
reach
her
brain
,
--
''
`
What
have
you
done
to
me
?
'
*NL*
you
say
!
Ah
!
what
have
you
done
to
me
,
gypsy
!
Well
!
listen
.
--
I
had
a
*NL*
child
!
you
see
!
I
had
a
child
!
a
child
,
I
tell
you
!
--
a
pretty
little
*NL*
girl
!
--
my
Agnes
!
''
she
went
on
wildly
,
kissing
something
in
the
*NL*
dark
.
--
``
Well
!
do
you
see
,
daughter
of
Egypt
?
they
took
my
child
from
me
;
*NL*
they
stole
my
child
;
they
ate
my
child
.
That
is
what
you
have
done
to
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
girl
replied
like
a
lamb
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
!
perchance
I
was
not
born
then
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
yes
!
''
returned
the
recluse
,
``
you
must
have
been
born
.
You
were
*NL*
among
them
.
She
would
be
the
same
age
as
you
!
so
!
--
I
have
been
here
*NL*
fifteen
years
;
fifteen
years
have
I
suffered
;
fifteen
years
have
I
*NL*
prayed
;
fifteen
years
have
I
beat
my
head
against
these
four
walls
--
I
*NL*
tell
you
that
't
was
the
gypsies
who
stole
her
from
me
,
do
you
hear
that
?
*NL*
and
who
ate
her
with
their
teeth
.
--
Have
you
a
heart
?
imagine
a
child
*NL*
playing
,
a
child
sucking
;
a
child
sleeping
.
It
is
so
innocent
a
*NL*
thing
!
--
Well
!
that
,
that
is
what
they
took
from
me
,
what
they
killed
.
*NL*
The
good
God
knows
it
well
!
To-day
,
it
is
my
turn
;
I
am
going
to
eat
the
*NL*
gypsy
.
--
Oh
!
I
would
bite
you
well
,
if
the
bars
did
not
prevent
me
!
My
*NL*
head
is
too
large
!
--
Poor
little
one
!
while
she
was
asleep
!
And
if
*NL*
they
woke
her
up
when
they
took
her
,
in
vain
she
might
cry
;
I
was
not
*NL*
there
!
--
Ah
!
gypsy
mothers
,
you
devoured
my
child
!
come
see
your
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
began
to
laugh
or
to
gnash
her
teeth
,
for
the
two
things
*NL*
resembled
each
other
in
that
furious
face
.
The
day
was
beginning
to
*NL*
dawn
.
An
ashy
gleam
dimly
lighted
this
scene
,
and
the
gallows
grew
more
*NL*
and
more
distinct
in
the
square
.
On
the
other
side
,
in
the
direction
of
*NL*
the
bridge
of
Notre-Dame
,
the
poor
condemned
girl
fancied
that
she
heard
*NL*
the
sound
of
cavalry
approaching
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madam
,
''
she
cried
,
clasping
her
hands
and
falling
on
her
knees
,
*NL*
dishevelled
,
distracted
,
mad
with
fright
;
``
madam
!
have
pity
!
They
are
*NL*
coming
.
I
have
done
nothing
to
you
.
Would
you
wish
to
see
me
die
in
this
*NL*
horrible
fashion
before
your
very
eyes
?
You
are
pitiful
,
I
am
sure
.
It
*NL*
is
too
frightful
.
Let
me
make
my
escape
.
Release
me
!
Mercy
.
I
do
not
*NL*
wish
to
die
like
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
me
back
my
child
!
''
said
the
recluse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mercy
!
Mercy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
me
back
my
child
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Release
me
,
in
the
name
of
heaven
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
me
back
my
child
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
the
young
girl
fell
;
exhausted
,
broken
,
and
having
already
the
*NL*
glassy
eye
of
a
person
in
the
grave
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
!
''
she
faltered
,
``
you
seek
your
child
,
I
seek
my
parents
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
me
back
my
little
Agnes
!
''
pursued
Gudule
.
``
You
do
not
know
where
*NL*
she
is
?
Then
die
!
--
I
will
tell
you
.
I
was
a
woman
of
the
town
,
I
had
a
*NL*
child
,
they
took
my
child
.
It
was
the
gypsies
.
You
see
plainly
that
you
*NL*
must
die
.
When
your
mother
,
the
gypsy
,
comes
to
reclaim
you
,
I
shall
say
*NL*
to
her
:
`
Mother
,
look
at
that
gibbet
!
--
Or
,
give
me
back
my
child
.
Do
you
*NL*
know
where
she
is
,
my
little
daughter
?
Stay
!
I
will
show
you
.
Here
is
*NL*
her
shoe
,
all
that
is
left
me
of
her
.
Do
you
know
where
its
mate
is
?
If
*NL*
you
know
,
tell
me
,
and
if
it
is
only
at
the
other
end
of
the
world
,
I
*NL*
will
crawl
to
it
on
my
knees
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
spoke
thus
,
with
her
other
arm
extended
through
the
window
,
*NL*
she
showed
the
gypsy
the
little
embroidered
shoe
.
It
was
already
light
*NL*
enough
to
distinguish
its
shape
and
its
colors
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
see
that
shoe
,
''
said
the
gypsy
,
quivering
.
``
God
!
God
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
at
the
same
time
,
with
her
hand
which
was
at
liberty
,
she
quickly
*NL*
opened
the
little
bag
ornamented
with
green
glass
,
which
she
wore
about
*NL*
her
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
on
,
go
on
!
''
grumbled
Gudule
,
``
search
your
demon
's
amulet
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
,
she
stopped
short
,
trembled
in
every
limb
,
and
cried
in
a
*NL*
voice
which
proceeded
from
the
very
depths
of
her
being
:
``
My
daughter
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
gypsy
had
just
drawn
from
the
bag
a
little
shoe
absolutely
similar
*NL*
to
the
other
.
To
this
little
shoe
was
attached
a
parchment
on
which
was
*NL*
inscribed
this
charm
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
_
Quand
le
parell
retrouveras
*NL*
Ta
mere
te
tendras
les
bras
_
.
*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
When
thou
shalt
find
its
mate
,
thy
mother
will
stretch
out
*NL*
her
arms
to
thee
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Quicker
than
a
flash
of
lightning
,
the
recluse
had
laid
the
two
shoes
*NL*
together
,
had
read
the
parchment
and
had
put
close
to
the
bars
of
the
*NL*
window
her
face
beaming
with
celestial
joy
as
she
cried
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
daughter
!
my
daughter
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
mother
!
''
said
the
gypsy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
we
are
unequal
to
the
task
of
depicting
the
scene
.
The
wall
and
the
*NL*
iron
bars
were
between
them
.
``
Oh
!
the
wall
!
''
cried
the
recluse
.
``
Oh
!
to
*NL*
see
her
and
not
to
embrace
her
!
Your
hand
!
your
hand
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
girl
passed
her
arm
through
the
opening
;
the
recluse
threw
*NL*
herself
on
that
hand
,
pressed
her
lips
to
it
and
there
remained
,
buried
*NL*
in
that
kiss
,
giving
no
other
sign
of
life
than
a
sob
which
heaved
her
*NL*
breast
from
time
to
time
.
In
the
meanwhile
,
she
wept
in
torrents
,
in
*NL*
silence
,
in
the
dark
,
like
a
rain
at
night
.
The
poor
mother
poured
out
*NL*
in
floods
upon
that
adored
hand
the
dark
and
deep
well
of
tears
,
which
*NL*
lay
within
her
,
and
into
which
her
grief
had
filtered
,
drop
by
drop
,
for
*NL*
fifteen
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
she
rose
,
flung
aside
her
long
gray
hair
from
her
brow
,
and
*NL*
without
uttering
a
word
,
began
to
shake
the
bars
of
her
cage
cell
,
with
*NL*
both
hands
,
more
furiously
than
a
lioness
.
The
bars
held
firm
.
Then
she
*NL*
went
to
seek
in
the
corner
of
her
cell
a
huge
paving
stone
,
which
served
*NL*
her
as
a
pillow
,
and
launched
it
against
them
with
such
violence
that
*NL*
one
of
the
bars
broke
,
emitting
thousands
of
sparks
.
A
second
blow
*NL*
completely
shattered
the
old
iron
cross
which
barricaded
the
window
.
*NL*
Then
with
her
two
hands
,
she
finished
breaking
and
removing
the
rusted
*NL*
stumps
of
the
bars
.
There
are
moments
when
woman
's
hands
possess
*NL*
superhuman
strength
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
passage
broken
,
less
than
a
minute
was
required
for
her
to
seize
her
*NL*
daughter
by
the
middle
of
her
body
,
and
draw
her
into
her
cell
.
``
Come
*NL*
let
me
draw
you
out
of
the
abyss
,
''
she
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
her
daughter
was
inside
the
cell
,
she
laid
her
gently
on
the
*NL*
ground
,
then
raised
her
up
again
,
and
bearing
her
in
her
arms
as
though
*NL*
she
were
still
only
her
little
Agnes
,
she
walked
to
and
fro
in
her
*NL*
little
room
,
intoxicated
,
frantic
,
joyous
,
crying
out
,
singing
,
kissing
*NL*
her
daughter
,
talking
to
her

bursting
into
laughter

melting
into
*NL*
tears
,
all
at
once
and
with
vehemence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
daughter

my
daughter

she
said
.
``
I
have
my
daughter

here
she
is

*NL*
The
good
God
has
given
her
back

you

all

Is
there

any

there
to

Lord

how
beautiful
*NL*
she
is
!
You
have
made
me
wait
fifteen
years
,
my
good
God

but
it
was
in
*NL*
order
to
give
her
back
to
me
beautiful

Then
the
gypsies
did
not
eat
*NL*
her
!
Who
said
so
?
My
little
daughter

my
little
daughter

Kiss
me

Those
*NL*
good
gypsies
!
I
love
the
gypsies

It
is
really
you

That
was
what
made
*NL*
my
heart
leap
every
time
that
you
passed
by

And
I
took
that
for
hatred
!
*NL*
Forgive
me

my
Agnes

forgive
me

You
thought
me
very
malicious

did
*NL*
you
not

I
love
you

Have
you
still
the
little
mark
on
your
neck

Let
*NL*
us
see

She
still
has
it

Oh

you
are
beautiful

It
was
I
who
gave
you
*NL*
those
big
eyes

mademoiselle

Kiss
me

I
love
you

It
is
nothing
to
me
*NL*
that
other
mothers
have
children

I
scorn
them
now

They
have
only
to
*NL*
come
and
see

Here
is
mine

See
her
neck

her
eyes

her
hair

Find
me
anything
as
beautiful
as

Oh
!
I
promise
you
she
will
have
*NL*
lovers

that
she
will

I
have
wept
for
fifteen
years

All
my
beauty
has
*NL*
departed

has
fallen
to
her

Kiss
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
addressed
to
her
a
thousand
other
extravagant
remarks
,
whose
accent
*NL*
constituted
their
sole
beauty
,
disarranged
the
poor
girl
's
garments
even
*NL*
to
the
point
of
making
her
blush
,
smoothed
her
silky
hair
with
her
hand
,
*NL*
kissed
her
foot
,
her
knee
,
her
brow
,
her
eyes
,
was
in
raptures
over
*NL*
everything
.
The
young
girl
let
her
have
her
way
,
repeating
at
intervals
*NL*
and
very
low
and
with
infinite
tenderness
,
``
My
mother
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
see

my
little

resumed
the
recluse
,
interspersing
her
*NL*
words
with
kisses
,
``
I
shall
love
you
dearly

We
will
go
away

here

We

I
have
inherited
something
in

in

our
country

You

Reims

Ah

no

you
do

small

seven

We

have
a
field

put
you

I

my

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

my
mother
!

said
the
young
girl
,
at
length
finding
strength
to
*NL*
speak
in
her
emotion
,
``
the
gypsy
woman
told
me
so

There
was
a
good
*NL*
gypsy
of
our
band
who
died
last
year

and
who
always
cared
for
me
like
*NL*
a
nurse
.
It
was
she
who
placed
this
little
bag
about
my
neck
.
She
always
*NL*
said
to
me
:

Little
one

guard
this
jewel
well

'T
is
a
treasure

It

*NL*
cause
thee
to
find
thy

once
again

Thou
wearest
thy

about
*NL*
thy
neck

The
gypsy
predicted
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sacked
nun
again
pressed
her
daughter
in
her
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
let
me
kiss
you
!
You
say
that
prettily
.
When
we
are
in
the
*NL*
country
,
we
will
place
these
little
shoes
on
an
infant
Jesus
in
the
*NL*
church
.
We
certainly
owe
that
to
the
good
,
holy
Virgin
.
What
a
pretty
*NL*
voice
you
have
!
When
you
spoke
to
me
just
now
,
it
was
music
!
Ah
!
my
Lord
*NL*
God
!
I
have
found
my
child
again
!
But
is
this
story
credible
?
Nothing
*NL*
will
kill
one
--
or
I
should
have
died
of
joy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
she
began
to
clap
her
hands
again
and
to
laugh
and
to
cry
out
:
*NL*
``
We
are
going
to
be
so
happy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
,
the
cell
resounded
with
the
clang
of
arms
and
a
*NL*
galloping
of
horses
which
seemed
to
be
coming
from
the
Pont
Notre-Dame
,
*NL*
amid
advancing
farther
and
farther
along
the
quay
.
The
gypsy
threw
*NL*
herself
with
anguish
into
the
arms
of
the
sacked
nun
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Save

What

you
done

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

replied
the
unhappy
child
;
``

I
am
condemned
to
die

*NL*
*NL*
``
To

said
Gudule
,
staggering
as
though
struck
by
lightning
;
``
to
*NL*
die

she
repeated
slowly
,
gazing
at
her
daughter
with
staring
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

mother

''
replied
the
frightened
young
girl
,
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
recluse
remained
for
several
moments
motionless
and
petrified
,
then
*NL*
she
moved
her
head
in
sign
of
doubt
,
and
suddenly
giving
vent
to
a
burst
*NL*
of
laughter
,
but
with
that
terrible
laugh
which
had
come
back
to
her
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ho
!
ho
!
no
!
't
is
a
dream
of
which
you
are
telling
me
.
Ah
,
yes
!
I
lost
*NL*
her
,
that
lasted
fifteen
years
,
and
then
I
found
her
again
,
and
that
*NL*
lasted
a
minute
!
And
they
would
take
her
from
me
again
!
And
now
,
when
*NL*
she
is
beautiful
,
when
she
is
grown
up
,
when
she
speaks
to
me
,
when
she
*NL*
loves
me
;
it
is
now
that
they
would
come
to
devour
her
,
before
my
very
*NL*
eyes
,
and
I
her
mother
!
Oh
!
no
!
these
things
are
not
possible
.
The
good
*NL*
God
does
not
permit
such
things
as
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
cavalcade
appeared
to
halt
,
and
a
voice
was
heard
to
say
in
the
*NL*
distance
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
way
,
Messire
Tristan
!
The
priest
says
that
we
shall
find
her
at
*NL*
the
Rat-Hole

The
noise
of
the
horses
began
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
recluse
sprang
to
her
feet
with
a
shriek
of
despair
.
``
Fly
!
fly
!
my
*NL*
child
!
All
comes
back
to
me
.
You
are
right
.
It
is
your
death
!
Horror
!
*NL*
Maledictions
!
Fly
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
thrust
her
head
through
the
window
,
and
withdrew
it
again
hastily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Remain
,
''
she
said
,
in
a
low
,
curt
,
and
lugubrious
tone
,
as
she
pressed
*NL*
the
hand
of
the
gypsy
,
who
was
more
dead
than
alive
.
``
Remain
!
Do
not
*NL*
breathe
!
There
are
soldiers
everywhere
.
You
can
not
get
out
.
It
is
too
*NL*
light
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
eyes
were
dry
and
burning
.
She
remained
silent
for
a
moment
;
but
she
*NL*
paced
the
cell
hurriedly
,
and
halted
now
and
then
to
pluck
out
handfuls
*NL*
of
her
gray
hairs
,
which
she
afterwards
tore
with
her
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
she
said
:
``
They
draw
near
.
I
will
speak
with
them
.
Hide
*NL*
yourself
in
this
corner
.
They
will
not
see
you
.
I
will
tell
them
that
*NL*
you
have
made
your
escape
.
That
I
released
you
,
i
'
faith
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
set
her
daughter
-LRB-
down
for
she
was
still
carrying
her
-RRB-
,
in
one
*NL*
corner
of
the
cell
which
was
not
visible
from
without
.
She
made
her
*NL*
crouch
down
,
arranged
her
carefully
so
that
neither
foot
nor
hand
*NL*
projected
from
the
shadow
,
untied
her
black
hair
which
she
spread
over
*NL*
her
white
robe
to
conceal
it
,
placed
in
front
of
her
her
jug
and
her
*NL*
paving
stone
,
the
only
articles
of
furniture
which
she
possessed
,
*NL*
imagining
that
this
jug
and
stone
would
hide
her
.
And
when
this
was
*NL*
finished
she
became
more
tranquil
,
and
knelt
down
to
pray
.
The
day
,
*NL*
which
was
only
dawning
,
still
left
many
shadows
in
the
Rat-Hole
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
,
the
voice
of
the
priest
,
that
infernal
voice
,
passed
*NL*
very
close
to
the
cell
,
crying
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
way
,
Captain
Phoebus
de
Chateaupers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
name
,
at
that
voice
,
la
Esmeralda
,
crouching
in
her
corner
,
made
*NL*
a
movement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
stir
!
''
said
Gudule
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
barely
finished
when
a
tumult
of
men
,
swords
,
and
horses
halted
*NL*
around
the
cell
.
The
mother
rose
quickly
and
went
to
post
herself
before
*NL*
her
window
,
in
order
to
stop
it
up
.
She
beheld
a
large
troop
of
armed
*NL*
men
,
both
horse
and
foot
,
drawn
up
on
the
Greve
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
commander
dismounted
,
and
came
toward
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Old
woman
!
''
said
this
man
,
who
had
an
atrocious
face
,
``
we
are
in
search
*NL*
of
a
witch
to
hang
her
;
we
were
told
that
you
had
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
mother
assumed
as
indifferent
an
air
as
she
could
,
and
*NL*
replied
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
not
what
you
mean

*NL*
*NL*
The
other
resumed
,
''
_
Tete

!
What
was
it
that
frightened
archdeacon
*NL*
said
?
Where
is
he

*NL*
*NL*
``
Monseigneur

said
a
soldier
,
``
he
has
disappeared

*NL*
*NL*
``
Come

now

old
madwoman

''
began
the
commander
again
,
``
do
not
lie

A
*NL*
sorceress
was
given
in
charge
to
you
.
What
have
you
done
with

?

*NL*
*NL*
The
recluse
did
not
wish
to
deny
all
,
for
fear
of
awakening
suspicion
,
*NL*
and
replied
in
a
sincere
and
surly
tone
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
are
speaking

a
big
young
girl

was
put
into

while

I
will
tell
you
that
she
bit
me
,
and
that
I
released
her

*NL*
There
!
Leave
me
in
peace

*NL*
*NL*
The
commander
made
a
grimace
of
disappointment
.
``
Do
n't
lie
to
me
,
old
*NL*
spectre

said
he
.
``
My
name

and
I
am
the
king

*NL*
gossip

Tristan

do
you
hear
?
''
He
added
,
as
he
glanced
at
the
*NL*
Place
de
Greve
around
him
,
''
'T
is
a
name
which
has
an
echo
here

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
might
be
Satan
the
Hermit

replied
Gudule
,
who
was
regaining
hope
,
*NL*
``
but
I
should
have
nothing
else
to
say
to
you

I
should
never
be

afraid

*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Tete-Dieu

''
said
Tristan
,
``
here
is
a
crone

Ah
!
So
the
witch
girl
*NL*
hath
fled

And
in
which
direction
did
she
go
?
''
Gudule
replied
in
a
*NL*
careless
tone
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Through
the
Rue
du
Mouton

I

*NL*
*NL*
Tristan
turned
his
head
and
made
a
sign
to
his
troop
to
prepare
to
set
*NL*
out
on
the
march
again
.
The
recluse
breathed
freely
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monseigneur
,
''
suddenly
said
an
archer
,
``
ask
the
old
elf
why
the
bars
of
*NL*
her
window
are
broken
in
this
manner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
question
brought
anguish
again
to
the
heart
of
the
miserable
*NL*
mother
.
Nevertheless
,
she
did
not
lose
all
presence
of
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
have
always
been
thus
,
''
she
stammered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bah
!
''
retorted
the
archer
,
``
only
yesterday
they
still
formed
a
fine
*NL*
black
cross
,
which
inspired
devotion

''
*NL*
*NL*
Tristan
east
a
sidelong
glance
at
the
recluse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
the
old
dame
is
getting
confused
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
unfortunate
woman
felt
that
all
depended
on
her
self-possession
,
*NL*
and
,
although
with
death
in
her
soul
,
she
began
to
grin
.
Mothers
possess
*NL*
such
strength
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bah
!
''
said
she
,
``
the
man
is
drunk
.
'T
is
more
than
a
year
since
the
tail
*NL*
of
a
stone
cart
dashed
against
my
window
and
broke
in
the
grating
.
And
*NL*
how
I
cursed
the
carter
,
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
true

said
another
archer
,
``
I
was
there

''
*NL*
*NL*
Always
and
everywhere
people
are
to
be
found
who
have
seen
everything
.
*NL*
This
unexpected
testimony
from
the
archer
re-encouraged
the
recluse
,
*NL*
whom
this
interrogatory
was
forcing
to
cross
an
abyss
on
the
edge
of
*NL*
a
knife
.
But
she
was
condemned
to
a
perpetual
alternative
of
hope
and
*NL*
alarm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
was
a
cart

did
it

retorted
the
first
soldier

``
the
stumps

thrust

ho
!
''
said
Tristan
to
the
soldier
,
``
you
have
the
nose
of
an
*NL*
inquisitor
of
the
Chatelet
.
Reply
to
what
he
says
,
old
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
heavens
!
''
she
exclaimed
,
driven
to
bay
,
and
in
a
voice
that
was
*NL*
full
of
tears
in
despite
of
her
efforts
,
``
I
swear
to
you
,
monseigneur
,
*NL*
that
't
was
a
cart
which
broke
those
bars
.
You
hear
the
man
who
saw
it
.
*NL*
And
then
,
what
has
that
to
do
with
your
gypsy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hum
!
''
growled
Tristan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
devil
!
''
went
on
the
soldier
,
flattered
by
the
provost
's
praise
,
*NL*
``
these
fractures
of
the
iron
are
perfectly
fresh
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tristan
tossed
his
head
.
She
turned
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
long
ago
,
say
you
,
did
the
cart
do
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
month
,
a
fortnight
,
perhaps
,
monseigheur
,
I
know
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
first
said
more
than
a
year
,
''
observed
the
soldier
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
suspicious
,
''
said
the
provost
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monseigneur
!
''
she
cried
,
still
pressed
against
the
opening
,
and
*NL*
trembling
lest
suspicion
should
lead
them
to
thrust
their
heads
through
*NL*
and
look
into
her
cell
;
``
monseigneur
,
I
swear
to
you
that
't
was
a
cart
*NL*
which
broke
this
grating
.
I
swear
it
to
you
by
the
angels
of
paradise
.
*NL*
If
it
was
not
a
cart
,
may
I
be
eternally
damned
,
and
I
reject
God
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
put
a
great
deal
of
heat
into
that
oath
;
''
said
Tristan
,
with
his
*NL*
inquisitorial
glance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
woman
felt
her
assurance
vanishing
more
and
more
.
She
had
*NL*
reached
the
point
of
blundering
,
and
she
comprehended
with
terror
that
*NL*
she
was
saying
what
she
ought
not
to
have
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
another
soldier
came
up
,
crying
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
the
old
hag
lies
.
The
sorceress
did
not
flee
through
the
Rue
*NL*
de
Mouton

The
street
chain
has
remained
stretched
all
night
,
and
the
*NL*
chain
guard
has
seen
no
one
pass
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tristan
,
whose
face
became
more
sinister
with
every
moment
,
addressed
*NL*
the
recluse
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
you
to
say
to
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
tried
to
make
head
against
this
new
incident
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
do
not
know
,
monseigneur
;
that
I
may
have
been
mistaken
.
I
*NL*
believe
,
in
fact
,
that
she
crossed
the
water
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
in
the
opposite
direction
,
''
said
the
provost
,
``
and
it
is
not
*NL*
very
likely
that
she
would
wish
to
re-enter
the
city

where
she
was
*NL*
being
pursued
.
You
are
lying
,
old
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then
,
''
added
the
first
soldier
,
``
there
is
no
boat
either
on
this
*NL*
side
of
the
stream
or
on
the
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
swam
across
,
''
replied
the
recluse
,
defending
her
ground
foot
by
*NL*
foot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
women
swim
?

said
the
soldier
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Tete
Dieu
_
!
old
woman
!
You
are
lying
!
''
repeated
Tristan
angrily
.
``
I
*NL*
have
a
good
mind
to
abandon
that
sorceress

take
you
.
A
quarter
of
an

hour
of
torture
will
,
perchance
,
draw
the
truth
from
your
throat
.
Come
!
*NL*
You
are
to
follow
us

*NL*
*NL*
She
seized
on
these
words
with
avidity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you
please
,
monseigneur

Do
it

Do

Take
*NL*
me
away
.
Quick
,
quick
!
let
us
set
out
at
once
!
--
During
that
time
,
''
she
*NL*
said
to
herself
,
``
my
daughter
will
make
her
escape
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'S
death
!
''
said
the
provost
,
``
what
an
appetite
for
the
rack
!
I
*NL*
understand
not
this
madwoman
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
An
old
,
gray-haired
sergeant
of
the
guard
stepped
out
of
the
ranks
,
and
*NL*
addressing
the
provost
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mad
in
sooth
,
monseigneur
.
If
she
released
the
gypsy
,
it
was
not
her
*NL*
fault
,
for
she
loves
not
the
gypsies
.
I
have
been
of
the
watch
these
*NL*
fifteen
years
,
and
I
hear
her
every
evening
cursing
the
Bohemian
women
*NL*
with
endless
imprecations
.
If
the
one
of
whom
we
are
in
pursuit
is
,
as
I
*NL*
suppose
,
the
little
dancer
with
the
goat
,
she
detests
that
one
above
all
*NL*
the
rest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gudule
made
an
effort
and
said
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
one
above
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
unanimous
testimony
of
the
men
of
the
watch
confirmed
the
old
*NL*
sergeant
's
words
to
the
provost
.
Tristan
l'Hermite
,
in
despair
at
*NL*
extracting
anything
from
the
recluse
,
turned
his
back
on
her
,
and
with
*NL*
unspeakable
anxiety
she
beheld
him
direct
his
course
slowly
towards
his
*NL*
horse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
!
''
he
said
,
between
his
teeth
,
``
March
on
!
let
us
set
out
again
on
*NL*
the
quest
.
I
shall
not
sleep
until
that
gypsy
is
hanged
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
still
hesitated
for
some
time
before
mounting
his
horse
.
Gudule
*NL*
palpitated
between
life
and
death
,
as
she
beheld
him
cast
about
the
*NL*
Place
that
uneasy
look
of
a
hunting
dog
which
instinctively
feels
that
*NL*
the
lair
of
the
beast
is
close
to
him
,
and
is
loath
to
go
away
.
At
*NL*
length
he
shook
his
head
and
leaped
into
his
saddle
.
Gudule
's
horribly
*NL*
compressed
heart
now
dilated
,
and
she
said
in
a
low
voice
,
as
she
cast
a
*NL*
glance
at
her
daughter
,
whom
she
had
not
ventured
to
look
at
while
they
*NL*
were
there
,
``
Saved
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
child
had
remained
all
this
time
in
her
corner
,
without
*NL*
breathing
,
without
moving
,
with
the
idea
of
death
before
her
.
She
had
*NL*
lost
nothing
of
the
scene
between
Gudule
and
Tristan
,
and
the
anguish
*NL*
of
her
mother
had
found
its
echo
in
her
heart
.
She
had
heard
all
the
*NL*
successive
snappings
of
the
thread
by
which
she
hung
suspended
over
the
*NL*
gulf
;
twenty
times
she
had
fancied
that
she
saw
it
break
,
and
at
last
*NL*
she
began
to
breathe
again
and
to
feel
her
foot
on
firm
ground
.
At
that
*NL*
moment
she
heard
a
voice
saying
to
the
provost
:
''
_
Corboeuf
_
!
Monsieur
*NL*
le
Prevot
,
't
is
no
affair
of
mine
,
a
man
of
arms
,
to
hang
witches
.
*NL*
The
rabble
of
the
populace
is
suppressed
.
I
leave
you
to
attend
to
the
*NL*
matter
alone
.
You
will
allow
me
to
rejoin
my
company
,
who
are
waiting
*NL*
for
their
captain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
voice
was
that
of
Phoebus
de
Chateaupers
;
that
which
took
place
*NL*
within
her
was
ineffable
.
He
was
there
,
her
friend
,
her
protector
,
her
*NL*
support
,
her
refuge
,
her
Phoebus
.
She
rose
,
and
before
her
mother
could
*NL*
prevent
her
,
she
had
rushed
to
the
window
,
crying
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Phoebus
!
aid
me
,
my
Phoebus
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Phoebus
was
no
longer
there
.
He
had
just
turned
the
corner
of
the
Rue
de
*NL*
la
Coutellerie
at
a
gallop
.
But
Tristan
had
not
yet
taken
his
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
recluse
rushed
upon
her
daughter
with
a
roar
of
agony
.
She
dragged
*NL*
her
violently
back
,
digging
her
nails
into
her
neck
.
A
tigress
mother
*NL*
does
not
stand
on
trifles
.
But
it
was
too
late
.
Tristan
had
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
!
he
!
''
he
exclaimed
with
a
laugh
which
laid
bare
all
his
teeth
and
*NL*
made
his
face
resemble
the
muzzle
of
a
wolf
,
``
two
mice
in
the
trap
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suspected
as
much
,
''
said
the
soldier
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tristan
clapped
him
on
the
shoulder
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
good
cat
!
Come
!
''
he
added
,
``
where
is
Henriet
Cousin
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
man
who
had
neither
the
garments
nor
the
air
of
a
soldier
,
stepped
*NL*
from
the
ranks
.
He
wore
a
costume
half
gray
,
half
brown
,
flat
hair
,
*NL*
leather
sleeves
,
and
carried
a
bundle
of
ropes
in
his
huge
hand
.
This
*NL*
man
always
attended
Tristan
,
who
always
attended
Louis
XI
.
``
Friend
,
''
*NL*
said
Tristan
l'Hermite
,
``
I
presume
that
this
is
the
sorceress
of
whom
we
*NL*
are
in
search
.
You
will
hang
me
this
one
.
Have
you
your
ladder
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
one
yonder
,
under
the
shed
of
the
Pillar-House
,
''
replied
the
*NL*
man
.
``
Is
it
on
this
justice
that
the
thing
is
to
be
done
?
''
he
added
,
*NL*
pointing
to
the
stone
gibbet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ho
,
he
!
''
continued
the
man
with
a
huge
laugh
,
which
was
still
more
*NL*
brutal
than
that
of
the
provost
,
``
we
shall
not
have
far
to
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Make
haste
!
''
said
Tristan
,
``
you
shall
laugh
afterwards
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
the
recluse
had
not
uttered
another
word
since
Tristan
*NL*
had
seen
her
daughter
and
all
hope
was
lost
.
She
had
flung
the
poor
*NL*
gypsy
,
half
dead
,
into
the
corner
of
the
cellar
,
and
had
placed
herself
*NL*
once
more
at
the
window
with
both
hands
resting
on
the
angle
of
the
sill
*NL*
like
two
claws
.
In
this
attitude
she
was
seen
to
cast
upon
all
those
*NL*
soldiers
her
glance
which
had
become
wild
and
frantic
once
more
.
At
the
*NL*
moment
when
Rennet
Cousin
approached
her
cell
,
she
showed
him
so
savage
*NL*
a
face
that
he
shrank
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monseigneur
,
''
he
said
,
returning
to
the
provost
,
``
which
am
I
to
take
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
young
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
much
the
better
,
for
the
old
one
seemeth
difficult
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
little
dancer
with
the
goat
!
''
said
the
old
sergeant
of
the
watch
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rennet
Cousin
approached
the
window
again
.
The
mother
's
eyes
made
his
*NL*
own
droop
.
He
said
with
a
good
deal
of
timidity
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madam
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
She
interrupted
him
in
a
very
low
but
furious
voice
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
ask
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
you
,
''
he
said
,
``
it
is
the
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
other
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
young
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
began
to
shake
her
head
,
crying
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
one
!
there
is
no
one
!
there
is
no
one
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
there
is
!
''
retorted
the
hangman
,
``
and
you
know
it
well
.
Let
me
*NL*
take
the
young
one
.
I
have
no
wish
to
harm
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
said
,
with
a
strange
sneer
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
so
you
have
no
wish
to
harm
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
have
the
other

madam
;
't
is
monsieur
the
provost
who
wills
it

*NL*
*NL*
She
repeated
with
a
look
of
madness
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
one
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
that
there
is
!
''
replied
the
executioner
.
``
We
have
all
seen
*NL*
that
there
are
two
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
then
!
''
said
the
recluse
,
with
a
sneer
.
``
Thrust
your
head
through
*NL*
the
window
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
executioner
observed
the
mother
's
finger-nails
and
dared
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Make
haste
!
''
shouted
Tristan
,
who
had
just
ranged
his
troops
in
a
*NL*
circle
round
the
Rat-Hole
,
and
who
sat
on
his
horse
beside
the
gallows
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rennet
returned
once
more
to
the
provost
in
great
embarrassment
.
He
had
*NL*
flung
his
rope
on
the
ground
,
and
was
twisting
his
hat
between
his
hands
*NL*
with
an
awkward
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monseigneur
,
''
he
asked
,
``
where
am
I
to
enter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
door
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
none
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
window
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
too
small
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Make
it
larger
,
''
said
Tristan
angrily
.
``
Have
you
not
pickaxes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
mother
still
looked
on
steadfastly
from
the
depths
of
her
cavern
.
*NL*
She
no
longer
hoped
for
anything
,
she
no
longer
knew
what
she
wished
,
*NL*
except
that
she
did
not
wish
them
to
take
her
daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rennet
Cousin
went
in
search
of
the
chest
of
tools
for
the
night
man
,
*NL*
under
the
shed
of
the
Pillar-House
.
He
drew
from
it
also
the
double
*NL*
ladder
,
which
he
immediately
set
up
against
the
gallows
.
Five
or
six
of
*NL*
the
provost
's
men
armed
themselves
with
picks
and
crowbars
,
and
Tristan
*NL*
betook
himself
,
in
company
with
them
,
towards
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Old
woman
,
''
said
the
provost
,
in
a
severe
tone
,
``
deliver
up
to
us
that
*NL*
girl
quietly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
like
one
who
does
not
understand

*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Tete

''
continued
Tristan
,
``
why
do
you
try
to
prevent
this
*NL*
sorceress
being
hung
as
it
pleases
the
king
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
wretched
woman
began
to
laugh
in
her
wild
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
She
is
my
daughter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
tone
in
which
she
pronounced
these
words
made
even
Henriet
Cousin
*NL*
shudder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
for
that
,
''
said
the
provost
,
``
but
it
is
the
king
's
good
*NL*
pleasure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
cried
,
redoubling
her
terrible
laugh
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
your
king
to
me
?
I
tell
you
that
she
is
my
daughter
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pierce
the
wall
,
''
said
Tristan
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
order
to
make
a
sufficiently
wide
opening
,
it
sufficed
to
dislodge
*NL*
one
course
of
stone
below
the
window
.
When
the
mother
heard
the
picks
*NL*
and
crowbars
mining
her
fortress
,
she
uttered
a
terrible
cry
;
then
she
*NL*
began
to
stride
about
her
cell
with
frightful
swiftness
,
a
wild
beasts
'
*NL*
habit
which
her
cage
had
imparted
to
her
.
She
no
longer
said
anything
,
*NL*
but
her
eyes
flamed
.
The
soldiers
were
chilled
to
the
very
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
she
seized
her
paving
stone
,
laughed
,
and
hurled
it
with
*NL*
both
fists
upon
the
workmen
.
The
stone
,
badly
flung
-LRB-
for
her
hands
*NL*
trembled
-RRB-
,
touched
no
one
,
and
fell
short
under
the
feet
of
Tristan
's
*NL*
horse
.
She
gnashed
her
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
although
the
sun
had
not
yet
risen
,
it
was
broad
*NL*
daylight
;
a
beautiful
rose
color
enlivened
the
ancient
,
decayed
chimneys
*NL*
of
the
Pillar-House
.
It
was
the
hour
when
the
earliest
windows
of
the
*NL*
great
city
open
joyously
on
the
roofs
.
Some
workmen
,
a
few
fruit-sellers
*NL*
on
their
way
to
the
markets
on
their
asses
,
began
to
traverse
the
Greve
;
*NL*
they
halted
for
a
moment
before
this
group
of
soldiers
clustered
round
*NL*
the
Rat-Hole
,
stared
at
it
with
an
air
of
astonishment
and
passed
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
recluse
had
gone
and
seated
herself
by
her
daughter
,
covering
her
*NL*
with
her
body
,
in
front
of
her
,
with
staring
eyes
,
listening
to
the
poor
*NL*
child
,
who
did
not
stir
,
but
who
kept
murmuring
in
a
low
voice
,
these
*NL*
words
only
,
``
Phoebus
!
Phoebus
!
''
In
proportion
as
the
work
of
the
*NL*
demolishers
seemed
to
advance
,
the
mother
mechanically
retreated
,
and
*NL*
pressed
the
young
girl
closer
and
closer
to
the
wall
.
All
at
once
,
the
*NL*
recluse
beheld
the
stone
-LRB-
for
she
was
standing
guard
and
never
took
*NL*
her
eyes
from
it
-RRB-
,
move
,
and
she
heard
Tristan
's
voice
encouraging
the
*NL*
workers
.
Then
she
aroused
from
the
depression
into
which
she
had
fallen
*NL*
during
the
last
few
moments
,
cried
out
,
and
as
she
spoke
,
her
voice
*NL*
now
rent
the
ear
like
a
saw
,
then
stammered
as
though
all
kind
of
*NL*
maledictions
were
pressing
to
her
lips
to
burst
forth
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ho
!
ho
!
ho
!
Why
this
is
terrible
!
You
are
ruffians
!
Are
you
really
*NL*
going
to
take
my
daughter
?
Oh
!
the
cowards
!
Oh
!
the
hangman
lackeys
!
*NL*
the
wretched
,
blackguard
assassins
!
Help

help

fire

Will
they
take
my
*NL*
child
from
me
like
this
?
Who
is
it
then
who
is
called
the
good
God
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
addressing
Tristan
,
foaming
at
the
mouth
,
with
wild
eyes
,
all
*NL*
bristling
and
on
all
fours
like
a
female
panther
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Draw
near
and
take
my
daughter
!
Do
not
you
understand
that
this
woman
*NL*
tells

Do
you
know
what
it
is
to
have
a
*NL*
child

Eh
!
lynx
,
have
you
never
lain
with
your
female
?
have
you
never
*NL*
had
a
cub
?
and
if
you
have
little
ones
,
when
they
howl
have
you
nothing
*NL*
in
your
vitals
that
moves
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Throw
down
the
stone
,
''
said
Tristan
;
``
it
no
longer
holds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
crowbars
raised
the
heavy
course
.
It
was
,
as
we
have
said
,
the
*NL*
mother
's
last
bulwark
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
threw
herself
upon
it
,
she
tried
to
hold
it
back
;
she
scratched
the
*NL*
stone
with
her
nails
,
but
the
massive
block
,
set
in
movement
by
six
men
,
*NL*
escaped
her
and
glided
gently
to
the
ground
along
the
iron
levers
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mother
,
perceiving
an
entrance
effected
,
fell
down
in
front
of
the
*NL*
opening
,
barricading
the
breach
with
her
body
,
beating
the
pavement
with
*NL*
her
head
,
and
shrieking
with
a
voice
rendered
so
hoarse
by
fatigue
that
*NL*
it
was
hardly
audible
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Help
!
fire
!
fire
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
take
the
wench
,
''
said
Tristan
,
still
impassive
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mother
gazed
at
the
soldiers
in
such
formidable
fashion
that
they
*NL*
were
more
inclined
to
retreat
than
to
advance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
now
,
''
repeated
the
provost
.
``
Here
you
,
Rennet
Cousin
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
took
a
step
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
provost
swore
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Tete
de
Christ
_
!
my
men
of
war
!
afraid
of
a
woman
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monseigneur
,
''
said
Rennet
,
``
do
you
call
that
a
woman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
the
mane
of
a
lion
,
''
said
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
!
''
repeated
the
provost
,
``
the
gap
is
wide
enough
.
Enter
three
*NL*
abreast
,
as
at
the
breach
of
Pontoise
.
Let
us
make
an
end
of
it
,
death
*NL*
of
Mahom
!
I
will
make
two
pieces
of
the
first
man
who
draws
back
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Placed
between
the
provost
and
the
mother
,
both
threatening
,
the
*NL*
soldiers
hesitated
for
a
moment
,
then
took
their
resolution
,
and
*NL*
advanced
towards
the
Rat-Hole
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
recluse
saw
this
,
she
rose
abruptly
on
her
knees
,
flung
aside
*NL*
her
hair
from
her
face
,
then
let
her
thin
flayed
hands
fall
by
her
side
.
*NL*
Then
great
tears
fell
,
one
by
one
,
from
her
eyes
;
they
flowed
down
*NL*
her
cheeks
through
a
furrow
,
like
a
torrent
through
a
bed
which
it
has
*NL*
hollowed
for
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
time
she
began
to
speak
,
but
in
a
voice
so
supplicating
,
*NL*
so
gentle
,
so
submissive
,
so
heartrending
,
that
more
than
one
old
*NL*
convict-warder
around
Tristan
who
must
have
devoured
human
flesh
wiped
*NL*
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Messeigneurs
!
messieurs
the
sergeants
,
one
word
.
There
is
one
thing
*NL*
which
I
must
say
to
you
.
She
is
my
daughter
,
do
you
see
?
my
dear
little
*NL*
daughter
whom
I
had
lost
!
Listen
.
It
is
quite
a
history
.
Consider
that
*NL*
I
knew
the
sergeants
very
well
.
They
were
always
good
to
me
in
the
*NL*
days
when
the
little
boys
threw
stones
at
me
,
because
I
led
a
life
of
*NL*
pleasure
.
Do
you
see
?
You
will
leave
me
my
child
when
you
know
!
I
was
a
*NL*
poor
woman
of
the
town
.
It
was
the
Bohemians
who
stole
her
from
me
.
And
*NL*
I
kept
her
shoe
for
fifteen
years
.
Stay
,
here
it
is
.
That
was
the
kind
*NL*
of
foot
which
she
had
.
At
Reims
!
La
Chantefleurie
!
Rue
Folle-Peine
!
*NL*
Perchance
,
you
knew
about
that
.
It
was
I
.
In
your
youth
,
then
,
there
was
*NL*
a
merry
time
,
when
one
passed
good
hours
.
You
will
take
pity
on
me
,
will
*NL*
you
not
,
gentlemen
?
The
gypsies
stole
her
from
me
;
they
hid
her
from
me
*NL*
for
fifteen
years
.
I
thought
her
dead
.
Fancy
,
my
good
friends
,
believed
*NL*
her
to
be
dead
.
I
have
passed
fifteen
years
here
in
this
cellar
,
without
*NL*
a
fire
in
winter
.
It
is
hard
.
The
poor
,
dear
little
shoe
!
I
have
cried
*NL*
so
much
that
the
good
God
has
heard
me
.
This
night
he
has
given
my
*NL*
daughter
back
to
me
.
It
is
a
miracle
of
the
good
God
.
She
was
not
dead
.
*NL*
You
will
not
take
her
from
me
,
I
am
sure
.
If
it
were
myself
,
I
would
*NL*
say
nothing
;
but
she
,
a
child
of
sixteen
!
Leave
her
time
to
see
the
sun
!
*NL*
What
has
she
done
to
you
?
nothing
at
all
.
Nor
have
I
.
If
you
did
but
*NL*
know
that
she
is
all
I
have
,
that
I
am
old
,
that
she
is
a
blessing
which
*NL*
the
Holy
Virgin
has
sent
to
me
!
And
then
,
you
are
all
so
good
!
You
did
*NL*
not
know
that
she
was
my
daughter
;
but
now
you
do
know
it
.
Oh
!
I
love
*NL*
her
!
Monsieur
,
the
grand
provost
.
I
would
prefer
a
stab
in
my
own
vitals
*NL*
to
a
scratch
on
her
finger
!
You
have
the
air
of
such
a
good
lord
!
What
*NL*
I
have
told
you
explains
the
matter
,
does
it
not
?
Oh
!
if
you
have
had
*NL*
a
mother
,
monsiegneur
!
you
are
the
captain
,
leave
me
my
child
!
Consider
*NL*
that
I
pray
you
on
my
knees
,
as
one
prays
to
Jesus
Christ
!
I
ask
nothing
*NL*
of
any
one
;
I
am
from
Reims
,
gentlemen
;
I
own
a
little
field
inherited
*NL*
from
my
uncle
,
Mahiet
Pradon
.
I
am
no
beggar
.
I
wish
nothing
,
but
I
do
*NL*
want
my
child
!
oh
!
I
want
to
keep
my
child
!
The
good
God
,
who
is
the
*NL*
master
,
has
not
given
her
back
to
me
for
nothing
!
The
king
!
you
say
the
*NL*
king
!
It
would
not
cause
him
much
pleasure
to
have
my
little
daughter
*NL*
killed
!
And
then
,
the
king
is
good
!
she
is
my
daughter
!
she
is
my
own
*NL*
daughter
!
She
belongs
not
to
the
king
!
she
is
not
yours
!
I
want
to
go
*NL*
away
!
we
want
to
go
away
!
and
when
two
women
pass
,
one
a
mother
and
the
*NL*
other
a
daughter
,
one
lets
them
go
!
Let
us
pass
!
we
belong
in
Reims
.
Oh
!
*NL*
you
are
very
good
,
messieurs
the
sergeants
,
I
love
you
all
.
You
will
not
*NL*
take
my
dear
little
one
,
it
is
impossible
!
It
is
utterly
impossible
,
is
*NL*
it
not
?
My
child
,
my
child
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
will
not
try
to
give
an
idea
of
her
gestures
,
her
tone
,
of
the
tears
*NL*
which
she
swallowed
as
she
spoke
,
of
the
hands
which
she
clasped
and
*NL*
then
wrung
,
of
the
heart-breaking
smiles
,
of
the
swimming
glances
,
*NL*
of
the
groans
,
the
sighs
,
the
miserable
and
affecting
cries
which
she
*NL*
mingled
with
her
disordered
,
wild
,
and
incoherent
words
.
When
she
became
*NL*
silent
Tristan
l'Hermite
frowned
,
but
it
was
to
conceal
a
tear
which
*NL*
welled
up
in
his
tiger
's
eye
.
He
conquered
this
weakness
,
however
,
and
*NL*
said
in
a
curt
tone
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
king
wills
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
bent
down
to
the
ear
of
Rennet
Cousin
,
and
said
to
him
in
a
very
*NL*
low
tone
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Make
an
end
of
it
quickly
!
''
Possibly
,
the
redoubtable
provost
felt
his
*NL*
heart
also
failing
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
executioner
and
the
sergeants
entered
the
cell
.
The
mother
offered
*NL*
no
resistance
,
only
she
dragged
herself
towards
her
daughter
and
threw
*NL*
herself
bodily
upon
her
.
The
gypsy
beheld
the
soldiers
approach
.
The
*NL*
horror
of
death
reanimated
her
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
!
''
she
shrieked
,
in
a
tone
of
indescribable
distress
,
``
Mother
!
*NL*
they
are
coming
!
defend
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
love
,
I
am
defending
you
!
''
replied
the
mother
,
in
a
dying
*NL*
voice
;
and
clasping
her
closely
in
her
arms
,
she
covered
her
with
*NL*
kisses
.
The
two
lying
thus
on
the
earth
,
the
mother
upon
the
daughter
,
*NL*
presented
a
spectacle
worthy
of
pity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rennet
Cousin
grasped
the
young
girl
by
the
middle
of
her
body
,
beneath
*NL*
her
beautiful
shoulders
.
When
she
felt
that
hand
,
she
cried
,
``
Heuh
!
''
and
*NL*
fainted
.
The
executioner
who
was
shedding
large
tears
upon
her
,
drop
*NL*
by
drop
,
was
about
to
bear
her
away
in
his
arms
.
He
tried
to
detach
the
*NL*
mother
,
who
had
,
so
to
speak
,
knotted
her
hands
around
her
daughter
's
*NL*
waist
;
but
she
clung
so
strongly
to
her
child
,
that
it
was
impossible
*NL*
to
separate
them
.
Then
Rennet
Cousin
dragged
the
young
girl
outside
the
*NL*
cell
,
and
the
mother
after
her
.
The
mother
's
eyes
were
also
closed
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
,
the
sun
rose
,
and
there
was
already
on
the
Place
a
*NL*
fairly
numerous
assembly
of
people
who
looked
on
from
a
distance
at
what
*NL*
was
being
thus
dragged
along
the
pavement
to
the
gibbet
.
For
that
was
*NL*
Provost
Tristan
's
way
at
executions
.
He
had
a
passion
for
preventing
the
*NL*
approach
of
the
curious
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
one
at
the
windows
.
Only
at
a
distance
,
at
the
summit
of
*NL*
that
one
of
the
towers
of
Notre-Dame
which
commands
the
Greve
,
two
men
*NL*
outlined
in
black
against
the
light
morning
sky
,
and
who
seemed
to
be
*NL*
looking
on
,
were
visible
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rennet
Cousin
paused
at
the
foot
of
the
fatal
ladder
,
with
that
which
*NL*
he
was
dragging
,
and
,
barely
breathing
,
with
so
much
pity
did
the
thing
*NL*
inspire
him
,
he
passed
the
rope
around
the
lovely
neck
of
the
young
*NL*
girl
.
The
unfortunate
child
felt
the
horrible
touch
of
the
hemp
.
She
*NL*
raised
her
eyelids
,
and
saw
the
fleshless
arm
of
the
stone
gallows
*NL*
extended
above
her
head
.
Then
she
shook
herself
and
shrieked
in
a
loud
*NL*
and
heartrending
voice
:
``
No
!
no
!
I
will
not
!
''
Her
mother
,
whose
head
was
*NL*
buried
and
concealed
in
her
daughter
's
garments
,
said
not
a
word
;
only
*NL*
her
whole
body
could
be
seen
to
quiver
,
and
she
was
heard
to
redouble
*NL*
her
kisses
on
her
child
.
The
executioner
took
advantage
of
this
moment
*NL*
to
hastily
loose
the
arms
with
which
she
clasped
the
condemned
girl
.
*NL*
Either
through
exhaustion
or
despair
,
she
let
him
have
his
way
.
Then
he
*NL*
took
the
young
girl
on
his
shoulder
,
from
which
the
charming
creature
*NL*
hung
,
gracefully
bent
over
his
large
head
.
Then
he
set
his
foot
on
the
*NL*
ladder
in
order
to
ascend
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
,
the
mother
who
was
crouching
on
the
pavement
,
opened
*NL*
her
eyes
wide
.
Without
uttering
a
cry
,
she
raised
herself
erect
with
*NL*
a
terrible
expression
;
then
she
flung
herself
upon
the
hand
of
the
*NL*
executioner
,
like
a
beast
on
its
prey
,
and
bit
it
.
It
was
done
like
a
*NL*
flash
of
lightning
.
The
headsman
howled
with
pain
.
Those
near
by
rushed
*NL*
up
.
With
difficulty
they
withdrew
his
bleeding
hand
from
the
mother
's
*NL*
teeth
.
She
preserved
a
profound
silence
.
They
thrust
her
back
with
much
*NL*
brutality
,
and
noticed
that
her
head
fell
heavily
on
the
pavement
.
They
*NL*
raised
her
,
she
fell
back
again
.
She
was
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
executioner
,
who
had
not
loosed
his
hold
on
the
young
girl
,
began
to
*NL*
ascend
the
ladder
once
more
.

CHAPTER

THE
BEAUTIFUL
CREATURE
CLAD
IN
WHITE

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Quasimodo
saw
that
the
cell
was
empty
,
that
the
gypsy
was
no
longer
*NL*
there
,
that
while
he
had
been
defending
her
she
had
been
abducted
,
he
*NL*
grasped
his
hair
with
both
hands
and
stamped
with
surprise
and
pain
;
*NL*
then
he
set
out
to
run
through
the
entire
church
seeking
his
Bohemian
,
*NL*
howling
strange
cries
to
all
the
corners
of
the
walls
,
strewing
his
red
*NL*
hair
on
the
pavement
.
It
was
just
at
the
moment
when
the
king
's
archers
*NL*
were
making
their
victorious
entrance
into
Notre-Dame
,
also
in
search
*NL*
of
the
gypsy
.
Quasimodo
,
poor
,
deaf
fellow
,
aided
them
in
their
fatal
*NL*
intentions
,
without
suspecting
it
;
he
thought
that
the
outcasts
were
the
*NL*
gypsy
's
enemies
.
He
himself
conducted
Tristan
l'Hermite
to
all
possible
*NL*
hiding-places
,
opened
to
him
the
secret
doors
,
the
double
bottoms
of
*NL*
the
altars
,
the
rear
sacristries
.
If
the
unfortunate
girl
had
still
been
*NL*
there
,
it
would
have
been
he
himself
who
would
have
delivered
her
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
fatigue
of
finding
nothing
had
disheartened
Tristan
,
who
was
*NL*
not
easily
discouraged
,
Quasimodo
continued
the
search
alone
.
He
made
*NL*
the
tour
of
the
church
twenty
times
,
length
and
breadth
,
up
and
*NL*
down
,
ascending
and
descending
,
running
,
calling
,
shouting
,
peeping
,
*NL*
rummaging
,
ransacking
,
thrusting
his
head
into
every
hole
,
pushing
a
*NL*
torch
under
every
vault
,
despairing
,
mad
.
A
male
who
has
lost
his
female
*NL*
is
no
more
roaring
nor
more
haggard
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
when
he
was
sure
,
perfectly
sure
that
she
was
no
longer
there
,
*NL*
that
all
was
at
an
end
,
that
she
had
been
snatched
from
him
,
he
slowly
*NL*
mounted
the
staircase
to
the
towers
,
that
staircase
which
he
had
*NL*
ascended
with
so
much
eagerness
and
triumph
on
the
day
when
he
had
*NL*
saved
her
.
He
passed
those
same
places
once
more
with
drooping
head
,
*NL*
voiceless
,
tearless
,
almost
breathless
.
The
church
was
again
deserted
,
*NL*
and
had
fallen
back
into
its
silence
.
The
archers
had
quitted
it
to
*NL*
track
the
sorceress
in
the
city
.
Quasimodo
,
left
alone
in
that
vast
*NL*
Notre-Dame
,
so
besieged
and
tumultuous
but
a
short
time
before
,
once
*NL*
more
betook
himself
to
the
cell
where
the
gypsy
had
slept
for
so
many
*NL*
weeks
under
his
guardianship
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
approached
it
,
he
fancied
that
he
might
,
perhaps
,
find
her
there
.
*NL*
When
,
at
the
turn
of
the
gallery
which
opens
on
the
roof
of
the
side
*NL*
aisles
,
he
perceived
the
tiny
cell
with
its
little
window
and
its
little
*NL*
door
crouching
beneath
a
great
flying
buttress
like
a
bird
's
nest
under
*NL*
a
branch
,
the
poor
man
's
heart
failed
him
,
and
he
leaned
against
a
*NL*
pillar
to
keep
from
falling
.
He
imagined
that
she
might
have
returned
*NL*
thither
,
that
some
good
genius
had
,
no
doubt
,
brought
her
back
,
that
*NL*
this
chamber
was
too
tranquil
,
too
safe
,
too
charming
for
her
not
to
*NL*
be
there
,
and
he
dared
not
take
another
step
for
fear
of
destroying
*NL*
his
illusion
.
``
Yes
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
perchance
she
is
sleeping
,
or
*NL*
praying
.
I
must
not
disturb
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
he
summoned
up
courage
,
advanced
on
tiptoe
,
looked
,
entered
.
*NL*
Empty
.
The
cell
was
still
empty
.
The
unhappy
deaf
man
walked
slowly
*NL*
round
it
,
lifted
the
bed
and
looked
beneath
it
,
as
though
she
might
be
*NL*
concealed
between
the
pavement
and
the
mattress
,
then
he
shook
his
head
*NL*
and
remained
stupefied
.
All
at
once
,
he
crushed
his
torch
under
his
*NL*
foot
,
and
,
without
uttering
a
word
,
without
giving
vent
to
a
sigh
,
he
*NL*
flung
himself
at
full
speed
,
head
foremost
against
the
wall
,
and
fell
*NL*
fainting
on
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
recovered
his
senses
,
he
threw
himself
on
the
bed
and
rolling
*NL*
about
,
he
kissed
frantically
the
place
where
the
young
girl
had
slept
*NL*
and
which
was
still
warm
;
he
remained
there
for
several
moments
as
*NL*
motionless
as
though
he
were
about
to
expire
;
then
he
rose
,
dripping
*NL*
with
perspiration
,
panting
,
mad
,
and
began
to
beat
his
head
against
the
*NL*
wall
with
the
frightful
regularity
of
the
clapper
of
his
bells
,
and
*NL*
the
resolution
of
a
man
determined
to
kill
himself
.
At
length
he
fell
*NL*
a
second
time
,
exhausted
;
he
dragged
himself
on
his
knees
outside
the
*NL*
cell
,
and
crouched
down
facing
the
door
,
in
an
attitude
of
astonishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
remained
thus
for
more
than
an
hour
without
making
a
movement
,
with
*NL*
his
eye
fixed
on
the
deserted
cell
,
more
gloomy
,
and
more
pensive
than
a
*NL*
mother
seated
between
an
empty
cradle
and
a
full
coffin
.
He
uttered
not
*NL*
a
word
;
only
at
long
intervals
,
a
sob
heaved
his
body
violently
,
but
it
*NL*
was
a
tearless
sob
,
like
summer
lightning
which
makes
no
noise
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
appears
to
have
been
then
,
that
,
seeking
at
the
bottom
of
his
lonely
*NL*
thoughts
for
the
unexpected
abductor
of
the
gypsy
,
he
thought
of
the
*NL*
archdeacon
.
He
remembered
that
Dom
Claude
alone
possessed
a
key
to
the
*NL*
staircase
leading
to
the
cell
;
he
recalled
his
nocturnal
attempts
on
*NL*
the
young
girl
,
in
the
first
of
which
he
,
Quasimodo
,
had
assisted
,
the
*NL*
second
of
which
he
had
prevented
.
He
recalled
a
thousand
details
,
and
*NL*
soon
he
no
longer
doubted
that
the
archdeacon
had
taken
the
gypsy
.
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
such
was
his
respect
for
the
priest
,
such
his
gratitude
,
*NL*
his
devotion
,
his
love
for
this
man
had
taken
such
deep
root
in
his
*NL*
heart
,
that
they
resisted
,
even
at
this
moment
,
the
talons
of
jealousy
*NL*
and
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
reflected
that
the
archdeacon
had
done
this
thing
,
and
the
wrath
*NL*
of
blood
and
death
which
it
would
have
evoked
in
him
against
any
other
*NL*
person
,
turned
in
the
poor
deaf
man
,
from
the
moment
when
Claude
Frollo
*NL*
was
in
question
,
into
an
increase
of
grief
and
sorrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
moment
when
his
thought
was
thus
fixed
upon
the
priest
,
while
*NL*
the
daybreak
was
whitening
the
flying
buttresses
,
he
perceived
on
*NL*
the
highest
story
of
Notre-Dame
,
at
the
angle
formed
by
the
external
*NL*
balustrade
as
it
makes
the
turn
of
the
chancel
,
a
figure
walking
.
This
*NL*
figure
was
coming
towards
him
.
He
recognized
it
.
It
was
the
archdeacon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Claude
was
walking
with
a
slow
,
grave
step
.
He
did
not
look
before
him
*NL*
as
he
walked
,
he
was
directing
his
course
towards
the
northern
tower
,
*NL*
but
his
face
was
turned
aside
towards
the
right
bank
of
the
Seine
,
and
*NL*
he
held
his
head
high
,
as
though
trying
to
see
something
over
the
roofs
.
*NL*
The
owl
often
assumes
this
oblique
attitude
.
It
flies
towards
one
*NL*
point
and
looks
towards
another
.
In
this
manner
the
priest
passed
above
*NL*
Quasimodo
without
seeing
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
deaf
man
,
who
had
been
petrified
by
this
sudden
apparition
,
beheld
*NL*
him
disappear
through
the
door
of
the
staircase
to
the
north
tower
.
The
*NL*
reader
is
aware
that
this
is
the
tower
from
which
the
Hotel-de-Ville
is
*NL*
visible
.
Quasimodo
rose
and
followed
the
archdeacon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Quasimodo
ascended
the
tower
staircase
for
the
sake
of
ascending
it
,
for
*NL*
the
sake
of
seeing
why
the
priest
was
ascending
it
.
Moreover
,
the
poor
*NL*
bellringer
did
not
know
what
he
-LRB-
Quasimodo
-RRB-
should
do
,
what
he
*NL*
should
say
,
what
he
wished
.
He
was
full
of
fury
and
full
of
fear
.
The
*NL*
archdeacon
and
the
gypsy
had
come
into
conflict
in
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
reached
the
summit
of
the
tower
,
before
emerging
from
the
shadow
*NL*
of
the
staircase
and
stepping
upon
the
platform
,
he
cautiously
examined
*NL*
the
position
of
the
priest
.
The
priest
's
back
was
turned
to
him
.
There
*NL*
is
an
openwork
balustrade
which
surrounds
the
platform
of
the
bell
*NL*
tower
.
The
priest
,
whose
eyes
looked
down
upon
the
town
,
was
resting
his
*NL*
breast
on
that
one
of
the
four
sides
of
the
balustrades
which
looks
upon
*NL*
the
Pont
Notre-Dame
.
*NL*
*NL*
Quasimodo
,
advancing
with
the
tread
of
a
wolf
behind
him
,
went
to
see
*NL*
what
he
was
gazing
at
thus
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
priest
's
attention
was
so
absorbed
elsewhere
that
he
did
not
hear
*NL*
the
deaf
man
walking
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paris
is
a
magnificent
and
charming
spectacle
,
and
especially
at
that
*NL*
day
,
viewed
from
the
top
of
the
towers
of
Notre-Dame
,
in
the
fresh
light
*NL*
of
a
summer
dawn
.
The
day
might
have
been
in
July
.
The
sky
was
perfectly
*NL*
serene
.
Some
tardy
stars
were
fading
away
at
various
points
,
and
there
*NL*
was
a
very
brilliant
one
in
the
east
,
in
the
brightest
part
of
the
*NL*
heavens
.
The
sun
was
about
to
appear
;
Paris
was
beginning
to
move
.
A
*NL*
very
white
and
very
pure
light
brought
out
vividly
to
the
eye
all
the
*NL*
outlines
that
its
thousands
of
houses
present
to
the
east
.
The
giant
*NL*
shadow
of
the
towers
leaped
from
roof
to
roof
,
from
one
end
of
the
great
*NL*
city
to
the
other
.
There
were
several
quarters
from
which
were
already
*NL*
heard
voices
and
noisy
sounds
.
Here
the
stroke
of
a
bell
,
there
the
*NL*
stroke
of
a
hammer
,
beyond
,
the
complicated
clatter
of
a
cart
in
motion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Already
several
columns
of
smoke
were
being
belched
forth
from
the
*NL*
chimneys
scattered
over
the
whole
surface
of
roofs
,
as
through
the
*NL*
fissures
of
an
immense
sulphurous
crater
.
The
river
,
which
ruffles
its
*NL*
waters
against
the
arches
of
so
many
bridges
,
against
the
points
of
so
*NL*
many
islands
,
was
wavering
with
silvery
folds
.
Around
the
city
,
outside
*NL*
the
ramparts
,
sight
was
lost
in
a
great
circle
of
fleecy
vapors
through
*NL*
which
one
confusedly
distinguished
the
indefinite
line
of
the
plains
,
*NL*
and
the
graceful
swell
of
the
heights
.
All
sorts
of
floating
sounds
were
*NL*
dispersed
over
this
half-awakened
city
.
Towards
the
east
,
the
morning
*NL*
breeze
chased
a
few
soft
white
bits
of
wool
torn
from
the
misty
fleece
*NL*
of
the
hills
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
Parvis
,
some
good
women
,
who
had
their
milk
jugs
in
their
*NL*
hands
,
were
pointing
out
to
each
other
,
with
astonishment
,
the
singular
*NL*
dilapidation
of
the
great
door
of
Notre-Dame
,
and
the
two
solidified
*NL*
streams
of
lead
in
the
crevices
of
the
stone
.
This
was
all
that
remained
*NL*
of
the
tempest
of
the
night
.
The
bonfire
lighted
between
the
towers
by
*NL*
Quasimodo
had
died
out
.
Tristan
had
already
cleared
up
the
Place
,
and
*NL*
had
the
dead
thrown
into
the
Seine
.
Kings
like
Louis
XI
.
are
careful
to
*NL*
clean
the
pavement
quickly
after
a
massacre
.
*NL*
*NL*
Outside
the
balustrade
of
the
tower
,
directly
under
the
point
where
the
*NL*
priest
had
paused
,
there
was
one
of
those
fantastically
carved
stone
*NL*
gutters
with
which
Gothic
edifices
bristle
,
and
,
in
a
crevice
of
that
*NL*
gutter
,
two
pretty
wallflowers
in
blossom
,
shaken
out
and
vivified
,
*NL*
as
it
were
,
by
the
breath
of
air
,
made
frolicsome
salutations
to
each
*NL*
other
.
Above
the
towers
,
on
high
,
far
away
in
the
depths
of
the
sky
,
the
*NL*
cries
of
little
birds
were
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
priest
was
not
listening
to
,
was
not
looking
at
,
anything
of
all
*NL*
this
.
He
was
one
of
the
men
for
whom
there
are
no
mornings
,
no
birds
,
*NL*
no
flowers
.
In
that
immense
horizon
,
which
assumed
so
many
aspects
about
*NL*
him
,
his
contemplation
was
concentrated
on
a
single
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
Quasimodo
was
burning
to
ask
him
what
he
had
done
with
the
gypsy
;
but
*NL*
the
archdeacon
seemed
to
be
out
of
the
world
at
that
moment
.
He
was
*NL*
evidently
in
one
of
those
violent
moments
of
life
when
one
would
not
*NL*
feel
the
earth
crumble
.
He
remained
motionless
and
silent
,
with
his
eyes
*NL*
steadily
fixed
on
a
certain
point
;
and
there
was
something
so
terrible
*NL*
about
this
silence
and
immobility
that
the
savage
bellringer
shuddered
*NL*
before
it
and
dared
not
come
in
contact
with
it
.
Only
,
and
this
was
also
*NL*
one
way
of
interrogating
the
archdeacon
,
he
followed
the
direction
of
*NL*
his
vision
,
and
in
this
way
the
glance
of
the
unhappy
deaf
man
fell
upon
*NL*
the
Place
de
Greve
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
he
saw
what
the
priest
was
looking
at
.
The
ladder
was
erected
near
*NL*
the
permanent
gallows
.
There
were
some
people
and
many
soldiers
in
*NL*
the
Place
.
A
man
was
dragging
a
white
thing
,
from
which
hung
something
*NL*
black
,
along
the
pavement
.
This
man
halted
at
the
foot
of
the
gallows
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
something
took
place
which
Quasimodo
could
not
see
very
clearly
.
It
*NL*
was
not
because
his
only
eye
had
not
preserved
its
long
range
,
but
there
*NL*
was
a
group
of
soldiers
which
prevented
his
seeing
everything
.
Moreover
,
*NL*
at
that
moment
the
sun
appeared
,
and
such
a
flood
of
light
overflowed
*NL*
the
horizon
that
one
would
have
said
that
all
the
points
in
Paris
,
*NL*
spires
,
chimneys
,
gables
,
had
simultaneously
taken
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
the
man
began
to
mount
the
ladder
.
Then
Quasimodo
saw
him
*NL*
again
distinctly
.
He
was
carrying
a
woman
on
his
shoulder
,
a
young
girl
*NL*
dressed
in
white
;
that
young
girl
had
a
noose
about
her
neck
.
Quasimodo
*NL*
recognized
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
reached
the
top
of
the
ladder
.
There
he
arranged
the
noose
.
Here
*NL*
the
priest
,
in
order
to
see
the
better
,
knelt
upon
the
balustrade
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
the
man
kicked
away
the
ladder
abruptly
,
and
Quasimodo
,
who
*NL*
had
not
breathed
for
several
moments
,
beheld
the
unhappy
child
dangling
*NL*
at
the
end
of
the
rope
two
fathoms
above
the
pavement
,
with
the
man
*NL*
squatting
on
her
shoulders
.
The
rope
made
several
gyrations
on
itself
,
*NL*
and
Quasimodo
beheld
horrible
convulsions
run
along
the
gypsy
's
body
.
*NL*
The
priest
,
on
his
side
,
with
outstretched
neck
and
eyes
starting
from
*NL*
his
head
,
contemplated
this
horrible
group
of
the
man
and
the
young
*NL*
girl
,
--
the
spider
and
the
fly
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
moment
when
it
was
most
horrible
,
the
laugh
of
a
demon
,
a
laugh
*NL*
which
one
can
only
give
vent
to
when
one
is
no
longer
human
,
burst
forth
*NL*
on
the
priest
's
livid
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Quasimodo
did
not
hear
that
laugh
,
but
he
saw
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bellringer
retreated
several
paces
behind
the
archdeacon
,
and
*NL*
suddenly
hurling
himself
upon
him
with
fury
,
with
his
huge
hands
he
*NL*
pushed
him
by
the
back
over
into
the
abyss
over
which
Dom
Claude
was
*NL*
leaning
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
priest
shrieked
:
``
Damnation
!
''
and
fell
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
spout
,
above
which
he
had
stood
,
arrested
him
in
his
fall
.
He
clung
*NL*
to
it
with
desperate
hands
,
and
,
at
the
moment
when
he
opened
his
mouth
*NL*
to
utter
a
second
cry
,
he
beheld
the
formidable
and
avenging
face
of
*NL*
Quasimodo
thrust
over
the
edge
of
the
balustrade
above
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
was
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
abyss
was
there
below
him
.
A
fall
of
more
than
two
hundred
feet
and
*NL*
the
pavement
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
terrible
situation
,
the
archdeacon
said
not
a
word
,
uttered
not
*NL*
a
groan
.
He
merely
writhed
upon
the
spout
,
with
incredible
efforts
to
*NL*
climb
up
again
;
but
his
hands
had
no
hold
on
the
granite
,
his
feet
slid
*NL*
along
the
blackened
wall
without
catching
fast
.
People
who
have
ascended
*NL*
the
towers
of
Notre-Dame
know
that
there
is
a
swell
of
the
stone
*NL*
immediately
beneath
the
balustrade
.
It
was
on
this
retreating
angle
*NL*
that
miserable
archdeacon
exhausted
himself
.
He
had
not
to
deal
with
a
*NL*
perpendicular
wall
,
but
with
one
which
sloped
away
beneath
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Quasimodo
had
but
to
stretch
out
his
hand
in
order
to
draw
him
from
the
*NL*
gulf
;
but
he
did
not
even
look
at
him
.
He
was
looking
at
the
Greve
.
He
*NL*
was
looking
at
the
gallows
.
He
was
looking
at
the
gypsy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
deaf
man
was
leaning
,
with
his
elbows
on
the
balustrade
,
at
the
*NL*
spot
where
the
archdeacon
had
been
a
moment
before
,
and
there
,
never
*NL*
detaching
his
gaze
from
the
only
object
which
existed
for
him
in
the
*NL*
world
at
that
moment
,
he
remained
motionless
and
mute
,
like
a
man
struck
*NL*
by
lightning
,
and
a
long
stream
of
tears
flowed
in
silence
from
that
eye
*NL*
which
,
up
to
that
time
,
had
never
shed
but
one
tear
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
the
archdeacon
was
panting
.
His
bald
brow
was
dripping
with
*NL*
perspiration
,
his
nails
were
bleeding
against
the
stones
,
his
knees
were
*NL*
flayed
by
the
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
heard
his
cassock
,
which
was
caught
on
the
spout
,
crack
and
rip
at
*NL*
every
jerk
that
he
gave
it
.
To
complete
his
misfortune
,
this
spout
ended
*NL*
in
a
leaden
pipe
which
bent
under
the
weight
of
his
body
.
The
archdeacon
*NL*
felt
this
pipe
slowly
giving
way
.
The
miserable
man
said
to
himself
*NL*
that
,
when
his
hands
should
be
worn
out
with
fatigue
,
when
his
cassock
*NL*
should
tear
asunder
,
when
the
lead
should
give
way
,
he
would
be
obliged
*NL*
to
fall
,
and
terror
seized
upon
his
very
vitals
.
Now
and
then
he
glanced
*NL*
wildly
at
a
sort
of
narrow
shelf
formed
,
ten
feet
lower
down
,
by
*NL*
projections
of
the
sculpture
,
and
he
prayed
heaven
,
from
the
depths
of
*NL*
his
distressed
soul
,
that
he
might
be
allowed
to
finish
his
life
,
were
*NL*
it
to
last
two
centuries
,
on
that
space
two
feet
square
.
Once
,
he
*NL*
glanced
below
him
into
the
Place
,
into
the
abyss
;
the
head
which
he
*NL*
raised
again
had
its
eyes
closed
and
its
hair
standing
erect
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
something
frightful
in
the
silence
of
these
two
men
.
While
*NL*
the
archdeacon
agonized
in
this
terrible
fashion
a
few
feet
below
him
,
*NL*
Quasimodo
wept
and
gazed
at
the
Greve
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
archdeacon
,
seeing
that
all
his
exertions
served
only
to
weaken
the
*NL*
fragile
support
which
remained
to
him
,
decided
to
remain
quiet
.
There
he
*NL*
hung
,
embracing
the
gutter
,
hardly
breathing
,
no
longer
stirring
,
making
*NL*
no
longer
any
other
movements
than
that
mechanical
convulsion
of
the
*NL*
stomach
,
which
one
experiences
in
dreams
when
one
fancies
himself
*NL*
falling
.
His
fixed
eyes
were
wide
open
with
a
stare
.
He
lost
ground
*NL*
little
by
little
,
nevertheless
,
his
fingers
slipped
along
the
spout
;
*NL*
he
became
more
and
more
conscious
of
the
feebleness
of
his
arms
and
the
*NL*
weight
of
his
body
.
The
curve
of
the
lead
which
sustained
him
inclined
*NL*
more
and
more
each
instant
towards
the
abyss
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
beheld
below
him
,
a
frightful
thing
,
the
roof
of
Saint-Jean
le
Rond
,
*NL*
as
small
as
a
card
folded
in
two
.
He
gazed
at
the
impressive
carvings
,
*NL*
one
by
one
,
of
the
tower
,
suspended
like
himself
over
the
precipice
,
but
*NL*
without
terror
for
themselves
or
pity
for
him
.
All
was
stone
around
him
;
*NL*
before
his
eyes
,
gaping
monsters
;
below
,
quite
at
the
bottom
,
in
the
*NL*
Place
,
the
pavement
;
above
his
head
,
Quasimodo
weeping
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
Parvis
there
were
several
groups
of
curious
good
people
,
who
were
*NL*
tranquilly
seeking
to
divine
who
the
madman
could
be
who
was
amusing
*NL*
himself
in
so
strange
a
manner
.
The
priest
heard
them
saying
,
for
their
*NL*
voices
reached
him
,
clear
and
shrill
:
``
Why
,
he
will
break
his
neck
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Quasimodo
wept
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
the
archdeacon
,
foaming
with
rage
and
despair
,
understood
that
*NL*
all
was
in
vain
.
Nevertheless
,
he
collected
all
the
strength
which
*NL*
remained
to
him
for
a
final
effort
.
He
stiffened
himself
upon
the
spout
,
*NL*
pushed
against
the
wall
with
both
his
knees
,
clung
to
a
crevice
in
the
*NL*
stones
with
his
hands
,
and
succeeded
in
climbing
back
with
one
foot
,
*NL*
perhaps
;
but
this
effort
made
the
leaden
beak
on
which
he
rested
*NL*
bend
abruptly
.
His
cassock
burst
open
at
the
same
time
.
Then
,
feeling
*NL*
everything
give
way
beneath
him
,
with
nothing
but
his
stiffened
and
*NL*
failing
hands
to
support
him
,
the
unfortunate
man
closed
his
eyes
and
*NL*
let
go
of
the
spout
.
He
fell
.
*NL*
*NL*
Quasimodo
watched
him
fall
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
fall
from
such
a
height
is
seldom
perpendicular
.
The
archdeacon
,
*NL*
launched
into
space
,
fell
at
first
head
foremost
,
with
outspread
hands
;
*NL*
then
he
whirled
over
and
over
many
times
;
the
wind
blew
him
upon
*NL*
the
roof
of
a
house
,
where
the
unfortunate
man
began
to
break
up
.
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
he
was
not
dead
when
he
reached
there
.
The
bellringer
saw
*NL*
him
still
endeavor
to
cling
to
a
gable
with
his
nails
;
but
the
surface
*NL*
sloped
too
much
,
and
he
had
no
more
strength
.
He
slid
rapidly
along
the
*NL*
roof
like
a
loosened
tile
,
and
dashed
upon
the
pavement
.
There
he
no
*NL*
longer
moved
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Quasimodo
raised
his
eyes
to
the
gypsy
,
whose
body
he
beheld
*NL*
hanging
from
the
gibbet
,
quivering
far
away
beneath
her
white
robe
with
*NL*
the
last
shudderings
of
anguish
,
then
he
dropped
them
on
the
archdeacon
,
*NL*
stretched
out
at
the
base
of
the
tower
,
and
no
longer
retaining
the
*NL*
human
form
,
and
he
said
,
with
a
sob
which
heaved
his
deep
chest
,
--
``
Oh
!
*NL*
all
that
I
have
ever
loved
!

CHAPTER

THE
MARRIAGE
OF
PHOEBUS
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
evening
on
that
day
,
when
the
judiciary
officers
of
the
bishop
*NL*
came
to
pick
up
from
the
pavement
of
the
Parvis
the
dislocated
corpse
of
*NL*
the
archdeacon
,
Quasimodo
had
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
great
many
rumors
were
in
circulation
with
regard
to
this
adventure
.
*NL*
No
one
doubted
but
that
the
day
had
come
when
,
in
accordance
with
their
*NL*
compact
,
Quasimodo
,
that
is
to
say
,
the
devil
,
was
to
carry
off
Claude
*NL*
Frollo
,
that
is
to
say
,
the
sorcerer
.
It
was
presumed
that
he
had
broken
*NL*
the
body
when
taking
the
soul
,
like
monkeys
who
break
the
shell
to
get
*NL*
at
the
nut
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
why
the
archdeacon
was
not
interred
in
consecrated
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Louis
XI
.
died
a
year
later
,
in
the
month
of
August
,
1483
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Pierre
Gringoire
,
he
succeeded
in
saving
the
goat
,
and
he
won
*NL*
success
in
tragedy
.
It
appears
that
,
after
having
tasted
astrology
,
*NL*
philosophy
,
architecture
,
hermetics
,
--
all
vanities
,
he
returned
to
*NL*
tragedy
,
vainest
pursuit
of
all
.
This
is
what
he
called
``
coming
to
a
*NL*
tragic
end
.
''
This
is
what
is
to
be
read
,
on
the
subject
of
his
dramatic
*NL*
triumphs
,
in
1483
,
in
the
accounts
of
the
``
Ordinary

CHAPTER

.
THE
MARRIAGE
OF
QUASIMODO
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
just
said
that
Quasimodo
disappeared
from
Notre-Dame
on
the
day
*NL*
of
the
gypsy
's
and
of
the
archdeacon
's
death
.
He
was
not
seen
again
,
in
*NL*
fact
;
no
one
knew
what
had
become
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
night
which
followed
the
execution
of
la
Esmeralda
,
the
night
*NL*
men
had
detached
her
body
from
the
gibbet
,
and
had
carried
it
,
according
*NL*
to
custom
,
to
the
cellar
of
Montfaucon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Montfaucon
was
,
as
Sauval
says
,
``
the
most
ancient
and
the
most
superb
*NL*
gibbet
in
the
kingdom
.
''
Between
the
faubourgs
of
the
Temple
and
Saint
*NL*
Martin
,
about
a
hundred
and
sixty
toises
from
the
walls
of
Paris
,
a
*NL*
few
bow
shots
from
La
Courtille
,
there
was
to
be
seen
on
the
crest
of
a
*NL*
gentle
,
almost
imperceptible
eminence
,
but
sufficiently
elevated
to
*NL*
be
seen
for
several
leagues
round
about
,
an
edifice
of
strange
form
,
*NL*
bearing
considerable
resemblance
to
a
Celtic
cromlech
,
and
where
also
*NL*
human
sacrifices
were
offered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
the
reader
picture
to
himself
,
crowning
a
limestone
hillock
,
an
*NL*
oblong
mass
of
masonry
fifteen
feet
in
height
,
thirty
wide
,
forty
*NL*
long
,
with
a
gate
,
an
external
railing
and
a
platform
;
on
this
platform
*NL*
sixteen
enormous
pillars
of
rough
hewn
stone
,
thirty
feet
in
height
,
*NL*
arranged
in
a
colonnade
round
three
of
the
four
sides
of
the
mass
which
*NL*
support
them
,
bound
together
at
their
summits
by
heavy
beams
,
whence
*NL*
hung
chains
at
intervals
;
on
all
these
chains
,
skeletons
;
in
the
*NL*
vicinity
,
on
the
plain
,
a
stone
cross
and
two
gibbets
of
secondary
*NL*
importance
,
which
seemed
to
have
sprung
up
as
shoots
around
the
central
*NL*
gallows
;
above
all
this
,
in
the
sky
,
a
perpetual
flock
of
crows
;
that
*NL*
was
Montfaucon
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
end
of
the
fifteenth
century
,
the
formidable
gibbet
which
dated
*NL*
from
1328
,
was
already
very
much
dilapidated
;
the
beams
were
wormeaten
,
*NL*
the
chains
rusted
,
the
pillars
green
with
mould
;
the
layers
of
hewn
*NL*
stone
were
all
cracked
at
their
joints
,
and
grass
was
growing
on
that
*NL*
platform
which
no
feet
touched
.
The
monument
made
a
horrible
profile
*NL*
against
the
sky
;
especially
at
night
when
there
was
a
little
moonlight
*NL*
on
those
white
skulls
,
or
when
the
breeze
of
evening
brushed
the
chains
*NL*
and
the
skeletons
,
and
swayed
all
these
in
the
darkness
.
The
presence
of
*NL*
this
gibbet
sufficed
to
render
gloomy
all
the
surrounding
places
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mass
of
masonry
which
served
as
foundation
to
the
odious
edifice
was
*NL*
hollow
.
A
huge
cellar
had
been
constructed
there
,
closed
by
an
old
iron
*NL*
grating
,
which
was
out
of
order
,
into
which
were
cast
not
only
the
human
*NL*
remains
,
which
were
taken
from
the
chains
of
Montfaucon
,
but
also
the
*NL*
bodies
of
all
the
unfortunates
executed
on
the
other
permanent
gibbets
*NL*
of
Paris
.
To
that
deep
charnel-house
,
where
so
many
human
remains
and
so
*NL*
many
crimes
have
rotted
in
company
,
many
great
ones
of
this
world
,
*NL*
many
innocent
people
,
have
contributed
their
bones
,
from
Enguerrand
de
*NL*
Marigni
,
the
first
victim
,
and
a
just
man
,
to
Admiral
de
Coligni
,
who
*NL*
was
its
last
,
and
who
was
also
a
just
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
the
mysterious
disappearance
of
Quasimodo
,
this
is
all
that
we
*NL*
have
been
able
to
discover
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
eighteen
months
or
two
years
after
the
events
which
terminate
this
*NL*
story
,
when
search
was
made
in
that
cavern
for
the
body
of
Olivier
le
*NL*
Daim
,
who
had
been
hanged
two
days
previously
,
and
to
whom
Charles
*NL*
VIII
.
had
granted
the
favor
of
being
buried
in
Saint
Laurent
,
in
better
*NL*
company
,
they
found
among
all
those
hideous
carcasses
two
skeletons
,
one
*NL*
of
which
held
the
other
in
its
embrace
.
One
of
these
skeletons
,
which
*NL*
was
that
of
a
woman
,
still
had
a
few
strips
of
a
garment
which
had
once
*NL*
been
white
,
and
around
her
neck
was
to
be
seen
a
string
of
adrezarach
*NL*
beads
with
a
little
silk
bag
ornamented
with
green
glass
,
which
was
open
*NL*
and
empty
.
These
objects
were
of
so
little
value
that
the
executioner
*NL*
had
probably
not
cared
for
them
.
The
other
,
which
held
this
one
in
a
*NL*
close
embrace
,
was
the
skeleton
of
a
man
.
It
was
noticed
that
his
spinal
*NL*
column
was
crooked
,
his
head
seated
on
his
shoulder
blades
,
and
that
one
*NL*
leg
was
shorter
than
the
other
.
Moreover
,
there
was
no
fracture
of
the
*NL*
vertebrae
at
the
nape
of
the
neck
,
and
it
was
evident
that
he
had
not
*NL*
been
hanged
.
Hence
,
the
man
to
whom
it
had
belonged
had
come
thither
and
*NL*
had
died
there
.
When
they
tried
to
detach
the
skeleton
which
he
held
in
*NL*
his
embrace
,
he
fell
to
dust
.

NOTE
*NL*
*NL*
ADDED
TO
THE
DEFINITIVE
EDITION
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
by
mistake
that
this
edition
was
announced
as
augmented
by
many
*NL*
new
chapters
.
The
word
should
have
been
unpublished
.
In
fact
,
if
by
new
,
*NL*
newly
made
is
to
be
understood
,
the
chapters
added
to
this
edition
are
*NL*
not
new
.
They
were
written
at
the
same
time
as
the
rest
of
the
work
;
*NL*
they
date
from
the
same
epoch
,
and
sprang
from
the
same
thought
,
they
*NL*
have
always
formed
a
part
of
the
manuscript
of
``
Notre-Dame-de-Paris
.
''
*NL*
Moreover
,
the
author
can
not
comprehend
how
fresh
developments
could
be
*NL*
added
to
a
work
of
this
character
after
its
completion
.
This
is
not
to
*NL*
be
done
at
will
.
According
to
his
idea
,
a
romance
is
born
in
a
manner
*NL*
that
is
,
in
some
sort
,
necessary
,
with
all
its
chapters
;
a
drama
is
born
*NL*
with
all
its
scenes
.
Think
not
that
there
is
anything
arbitrary
in
the
*NL*
numbers
of
parts
of
which
that
whole
,
that
mysterious
microcosm
which
*NL*
you
call
a
drama
or
a
romance
,
is
composed
.
Grafting
and
soldering
*NL*
take
badly
on
works
of
this
nature
,
which
should
gush
forth
in
a
single
*NL*
stream
and
so
remain
.
The
thing
once
done
,
do
not
change
your
mind
,
do
*NL*
not
touch
it
up
.
The
book
once
published
,
the
sex
of
the
work
,
whether
*NL*
virile
or
not
,
has
been
recognized
and
proclaimed
;
when
the
child
has
*NL*
once
uttered
his
first
cry
he
is
born
,
there
he
is
,
he
is
made
so
,
*NL*
neither
father
nor
mother
can
do
anything
,
he
belongs
to
the
air
and
*NL*
to
the
sun
,
let
him
live
or
die
,
such
as
he
is
.
Has
your
book
been
a
*NL*
failure
?
So
much
the
worse
.
Add
no
chapters
to
an
unsuccessful
book
.
Is
*NL*
it
incomplete
?
You
should
have
completed
it
when
you
conceived
it
.
*NL*
Is
your
tree
crooked
?
You
can
not
straighten
it
up
.
Is
your
romance
*NL*
consumptive
?
Is
your
romance
not
capable
of
living
?
You
can
not
supply
it
*NL*
with
the
breath
which
it
lacks
.
Has
your
drama
been
born
lame
?
Take
my
*NL*
advice
,
and
do
not
provide
it
with
a
wooden
leg
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hence
the
author
attaches
particular
importance
to
the
public
knowing
*NL*
for
a
certainty
that
the
chapters
here
added
have
not
been
made
*NL*
expressly
for
this
reprint
.
They
were
not
published
in
the
preceding
*NL*
editions
of
the
book
for
a
very
simple
reason
.
At
the
time
when
*NL*
``
Notre-Dame-de-Paris
''
was
printed
the
first
time
,
the
manuscript
of
*NL*
these
three
chapters
had
been
mislaid
.
It
was
necessary
to
rewrite
them
*NL*
or
to
dispense
with
them
.
The
author
considered
that
the
only
two
of
*NL*
these
chapters
which
were
in
the
least
important
,
owing
to
their
extent
,
*NL*
were
chapters
on
art
and
history
which
in
no
way
interfered
with
the
*NL*
groundwork
of
the
drama
and
the
romance
,
that
the
public
would
not
*NL*
notice
their
loss
,
and
that
he
,
the
author
,
would
alone
be
in
possession
*NL*
of
the
secret
.
He
decided
to
omit
them
,
and
then
,
if
the
whole
truth
*NL*
must
be
confessed
,
his
indolence
shrunk
from
the
task
of
rewriting
the
*NL*
three
lost
chapters
.
He
would
have
found
it
a
shorter
matter
to
make
a
*NL*
new
romance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
the
chapters
have
been
found
,
and
he
avails
himself
of
the
first
*NL*
opportunity
to
restore
them
to
their
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
now
,
is
his
entire
work
,
such
as
he
dreamed
it
,
such
as
he
made
it
,
*NL*
good
or
bad
,
durable
or
fragile
,
but
such
as
he
wishes
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
recovered
chapters
will
possess
no
doubt
,
but
little
value
in
*NL*
the
eyes
of
persons
,
otherwise
very
judicious
,
who
have
sought
in
*NL*
``
Notre-Dame-de-Paris
''
only
the
drama
,
the
romance
.
But
there
are
*NL*
perchance
,
other
readers
,
who
have
not
found
it
useless
to
study
the
*NL*
aesthetic
and
philosophic
thought
concealed
in
this
book
,
and
who
have
*NL*
taken
pleasure
,
while
reading
``
Notre-Dame-de-Paris
,
''
in
unravelling
*NL*
beneath
the
romance
something
else
than
the
romance
,
and
in
following
*NL*
-LRB-
may
we
be
pardoned
these
rather
ambitious
expressions
-RRB-
,
the
system
*NL*
of
the
historian
and
the
aim
of
the
artist
through
the
creation
of
the
*NL*
poet
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
such
people
especially
,
the
chapters
added
to
this
edition
will
*NL*
complete
``
Notre-Dame-de-Paris
,
''
if
we
admit
that
``
Notre-Dame-de-Paris
''
*NL*
was
worth
the
trouble
of
completing
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
one
of
these
chapters
on
the
present
decadence
of
architecture
,
and
*NL*
on
the
death
-LRB-
in
his
mind
almost
inevitable
-RRB-
of
that
king
of
arts
,
the
*NL*
author
expresses
and
develops
an
opinion
unfortunately
well
rooted
in
*NL*
him
,
and
well
thought
out
.
But
he
feels
it
necessary
to
say
here
that
he
*NL*
earnestly
desires
that
the
future
may
,
some
day
,
put
him
in
the
wrong
.
*NL*
He
knows
that
art
in
all
its
forms
has
everything
to
hope
from
the
new
*NL*
generations
whose
genius
,
still
in
the
germ
,
can
be
heard
gushing
forth
*NL*
in
our
studios
.
The
grain
is
in
the
furrow
,
the
harvest
will
certainly
*NL*
be
fine
.
He
merely
fears
,
and
the
reason
may
be
seen
in
the
second
*NL*
volume
of
this
edition
,
that
the
sap
may
have
been
withdrawn
from
that
*NL*
ancient
soil
of
architecture
which
has
been
for
so
many
centuries
the
*NL*
best
field
for
art
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
there
are
to-day
in
the
artistic
youth
so
much
life
,
*NL*
power
,
and
,
so
to
speak
,
predestination
,
that
in
our
schools
of
*NL*
architecture
in
particular
,
at
the
present
time
,
the
professors
,
who
*NL*
are
detestable
,
produce
,
not
only
unconsciously
but
even
in
spite
of
*NL*
themselves
,
excellent
pupils
;
quite
the
reverse
of
that
potter
mentioned
*NL*
by
Horace
,
who
dreamed
amphorae
and
produced
pots
.
_
Currit
rota
,
urcens
*NL*
exit
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
in
any
case
,
whatever
may
be
the
future
of
architecture
,
in
*NL*
whatever
manner
our
young
architects
may
one
day
solve
the
question
of
*NL*
their
art
,
let
us
,
while
waiting
for
new
monument
,
preserve
the
ancient
*NL*
monuments
.
Let
us
,
if
possible
,
inspire
the
nation
with
a
love
for
*NL*
national
architecture
.
That
,
the
author
declares
,
is
one
of
the
*NL*
principal
aims
of
this
book
;
it
is
one
of
the
principal
aims
of
his
*NL*
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Notre-Dame-de-Paris
''
has
,
perhaps
opened
some
true
perspectives
on
the
*NL*
art
of
the
Middle
Ages
,
on
that
marvellous
art
which
up
to
the
present
*NL*
time
has
been
unknown
to
some
,
and
,
what
is
worse
,
misknown
by
others
.
*NL*
But
the
author
is
far
from
regarding
as
accomplished
,
the
task
which
he
*NL*
has
voluntarily
imposed
on
himself
.
He
has
already
pleaded
on
more
than
*NL*
one
occasion
,
the
cause
of
our
ancient
architecture
,
he
has
already
*NL*
loudly
denounced
many
profanations
,
many
demolitions
,
many
impieties
.
He
*NL*
will
not
grow
weary
.
He
has
promised
himself
to
recur
frequently
to
this
*NL*
subject
.
He
will
return
to
it
.
He
will
be
as
indefatigable
in
defending
*NL*
our
historical
edifices
as
our
iconoclasts
of
the
schools
and
academies
*NL*
are
eager
in
attacking
them
;
for
it
is
a
grievous
thing
to
see
into
*NL*
what
hands
the
architecture
of
the
Middle
Ages
has
fallen
,
and
in
what
a
*NL*
manner
the
botchers
of
plaster
of
the
present
day
treat
the
ruin
of
this
*NL*
grand
art
,
it
is
even
a
shame
for
us
intelligent
men
who
see
them
at
*NL*
work
and
content
ourselves
with
hooting
them
.
And
we
are
not
speaking
*NL*
here
merely
of
what
goes
on
in
the
provinces
,
but
of
what
is
done
in
*NL*
Paris
at
our
very
doors
,
beneath
our
windows
,
in
the
great
city
,
in
the
*NL*
lettered
city
,
in
the
city
of
the
press
,
of
word
,
of
thought
.
We
can
not
*NL*
resist
the
impulse
to
point
out
,
in
concluding
this
note
,
some
of
*NL*
the
acts
of
vandalism
which
are
every
day
planned
,
debated
,
begun
,
*NL*
continued
,
and
successfully
completed
under
the
eyes
of
the
artistic
*NL*
public
of
Paris
,
face
to
face
with
criticism
,
which
is
disconcerted
by
*NL*
so
much
audacity
.
An
archbishop
's
palace
has
just
been
demolished
,
an
*NL*
edifice
in
poor
taste
,
no
great
harm
is
done
;
but
in
a
block
with
the
*NL*
archiepiscopal
palace
a
bishop
's
palace
has
been
demolished
,
a
rare
*NL*
fragment
of
the
fourteenth
century
,
which
the
demolishing
architect
*NL*
could
not
distinguish
from
the
rest
.
He
has
torn
up
the
wheat
with
*NL*
the
tares
;
't
is
all
the
same
.
They
are
talking
of
razing
the
*NL*
admirable
chapel
of
Vincennes
,
in
order
to
make
,
with
its
stones
,
some
*NL*
fortification
,
which
Daumesnil
did
not
need
,
however
.
While
the
Palais
*NL*
Bourbon
,
that
wretched
edifice
,
is
being
repaired
at
great
expense
,
*NL*
gusts
of
wind
and
equinoctial
storms
are
allowed
to
destroy
the
*NL*
magnificent
painted
windows
of
the
Sainte-Chapelle
.
For
the
last
few
*NL*
days
there
has
been
a
scaffolding
on
the
tower
of
Saint
Jacques
de
la
*NL*
Boucherie
;
and
one
of
these
mornings
the
pick
will
be
laid
to
it
.
A
*NL*
mason
has
been
found
to
build
a
little
white
house
between
the
venerable
*NL*
towers
of
the
Palais
de-Justice
.
Another
has
been
found
willing
to
prune
*NL*
away
Saint-Germain-des-Pres
,
the
feudal
abbey
with
three
bell
towers
.
*NL*
Another
will
be
found
,
no
doubt
,
capable
of
pulling
down
Saint-Germain
*NL*
l'Auxerrois
.
All
these
masons
claim
to
be
architects
,
are
paid
by
the
*NL*
prefecture
or
from
the
petty
budget
,
and
wear
green
coats
.
All
the
harm
*NL*
which
false
taste
can
inflict
on
good
taste
,
they
accomplish
.
While
*NL*
we
write
,
deplorable
spectacle
!
one
of
them
holds
possession
of
the
*NL*
Tuileries
,
one
of
them
is
giving
Philibert
Delorme
a
scar
across
the
*NL*
middle
of
his
face
;
and
it
is
not
,
assuredly
,
one
of
the
least
of
the
*NL*
scandals
of
our
time
to
see
with
what
effrontery
the
heavy
architecture
*NL*
of
this
gentleman
is
being
flattened
over
one
of
the
most
delicate
*NL*
facades
of
the
Renaissance
!
