PART

*NL*
*NL*
I.
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
the
end
of
November
,
during
a
thaw
,
at
nine
o'clock
one
morning
,
*NL*
a
train
on
the
Warsaw
and
Petersburg
railway
was
approaching
the
latter
*NL*
city
at
full
speed
.
The
morning
was
so
damp
and
misty
that
it
was
only
*NL*
with
great
difficulty
that
the
day
succeeded
in
breaking
;
and
it
was
*NL*
impossible
to
distinguish
anything
more
than
a
few
yards
away
from
the
*NL*
carriage
windows
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
of
the
passengers
by
this
particular
train
were
returning
from
*NL*
abroad
;
but
the
third-class
carriages
were
the
best
filled
,
chiefly
with
*NL*
insignificant
persons
of
various
occupations
and
degrees
,
picked
up
at
*NL*
the
different
stations
nearer
town
.
All
of
them
seemed
weary
,
and
*NL*
most
of
them
had
sleepy
eyes
and
a
shivering
expression
,
while
their
*NL*
complexions
generally
appeared
to
have
taken
on
the
colour
of
the
fog
*NL*
outside
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
day
dawned
,
two
passengers
in
one
of
the
third-class
carriages
*NL*
found
themselves
opposite
each
other
.
Both
were
young
fellows
,
both
*NL*
were
rather
poorly
dressed
,
both
had
remarkable
faces
,
and
both
were
*NL*
evidently
anxious
to
start
a
conversation
.
If
they
had
but
known
why
,
*NL*
at
this
particular
moment
,
they
were
both
remarkable
persons
,
they
would
*NL*
undoubtedly
have
wondered
at
the
strange
chance
which
had
set
them
down
*NL*
opposite
to
one
another
in
a
third-class
carriage
of
the
Warsaw
Railway
*NL*
Company
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
them
was
a
young
fellow
of
about
twenty-seven
,
not
tall
,
with
*NL*
black
curling
hair
,
and
small
,
grey
,
fiery
eyes
.
His
nose
was
broad
*NL*
and
flat
,
and
he
had
high
cheek
bones
;
his
thin
lips
were
constantly
*NL*
compressed
into
an
impudent
,
ironical
--
it
might
almost
be
called
a
*NL*
malicious
--
smile
;
but
his
forehead
was
high
and
well
formed
,
and
atoned
*NL*
for
a
good
deal
of
the
ugliness
of
the
lower
part
of
his
face
.
A
special
*NL*
feature
of
this
physiognomy
was
its
death-like
pallor
,
which
gave
to
*NL*
the
whole
man
an
indescribably
emaciated
appearance
in
spite
of
his
hard
*NL*
look
,
and
at
the
same
time
a
sort
of
passionate
and
suffering
expression
*NL*
which
did
not
harmonize
with
his
impudent
,
sarcastic
smile
and
*NL*
keen
,
self-satisfied
bearing
.
He
wore
a
large
fur
--
or
rather
*NL*
astrachan
--
overcoat
,
which
had
kept
him
warm
all
night
,
while
his
*NL*
neighbour
had
been
obliged
to
bear
the
full
severity
of
a
Russian
*NL*
November
night
entirely
unprepared
.
His
wide
sleeveless
mantle
with
a
*NL*
large
cape
to
it
--
the
sort
of
cloak
one
sees
upon
travellers
during
the
*NL*
winter
months
in
Switzerland
or
North
Italy
--
was
by
no
means
adapted
to
*NL*
the
long
cold
journey
through
Russia
,
from
Eydkuhnen
to
St.
Petersburg
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
wearer
of
this
cloak
was
a
young
fellow
,
also
of
about
twenty-six
or
*NL*
twenty-seven
years
of
age
,
slightly
above
the
middle
height
,
very
fair
,
*NL*
with
a
thin
,
pointed
and
very
light
coloured
beard
;
his
eyes
were
large
*NL*
and
blue
,
and
had
an
intent
look
about
them
,
yet
that
heavy
expression
*NL*
which
some
people
affirm
to
be
a
peculiarity
as
well
as
evidence
,
of
an
*NL*
epileptic
subject
.
His
face
was
decidedly
a
pleasant
one
for
all
that
;
*NL*
refined
,
but
quite
colourless
,
except
for
the
circumstance
that
at
this
*NL*
moment
it
was
blue
with
cold
.
He
held
a
bundle
made
up
of
an
old
faded
*NL*
silk
handkerchief
that
apparently
contained
all
his
travelling
wardrobe
,
*NL*
and
wore
thick
shoes
and
gaiters
,
his
whole
appearance
being
very
*NL*
un-Russian
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
black-haired
neighbour
inspected
these
peculiarities
,
having
nothing
*NL*
better
to
do
,
and
at
length
remarked
,
with
that
rude
enjoyment
of
the
*NL*
discomforts
of
others
which
the
common
classes
so
often
show
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cold
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
,
''
said
his
neighbour
,
readily
,
``
and
this
is
a
thaw
,
too
.
Fancy
if
*NL*
it
had
been
a
hard
frost
!
I
never
thought
it
would
be
so
cold
in
the
old
*NL*
country
.
I
've
grown
quite
out
of
the
way
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
been
abroad
,
I
suppose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
straight
from
Switzerland
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wheugh
!
my
goodness
!
''
The
black-haired
young
fellow
whistled
,
and
then
*NL*
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
conversation
proceeded
.
The
readiness
of
the
fair-haired
young
*NL*
man
in
the
cloak
to
answer
all
his
opposite
neighbour
's
questions
*NL*
was
surprising
.
He
seemed
to
have
no
suspicion
of
any
impertinence
*NL*
or
inappropriateness
in
the
fact
of
such
questions
being
put
to
him
.
*NL*
Replying
to
them
,
he
made
known
to
the
inquirer
that
he
certainly
had
*NL*
been
long
absent
from
Russia
,
more
than
four
years
;
that
he
had
been
*NL*
sent
abroad
for
his
health
;
that
he
had
suffered
from
some
strange
*NL*
nervous
malady
--
a
kind
of
epilepsy
,
with
convulsive
spasms
.
His
*NL*
interlocutor
burst
out
laughing
several
times
at
his
answers
;
and
*NL*
more
than
ever
,
when
to
the
question
,
``
whether
he
had
been
cured
?
''
the
*NL*
patient
replied
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
they
did
not
cure
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hey
!
that
's
it
!
You
stumped
up
your
money
for
nothing
,
and
we
*NL*
believe
in
those
fellows
,
here
!
''
remarked
the
black-haired
individual
,
*NL*
sarcastically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gospel
truth
,
sir
,
Gospel
truth
!
''
exclaimed
another
passenger
,
a
*NL*
shabbily
dressed
man
of
about
forty
,
who
looked
like
a
clerk
,
and
*NL*
possessed
a
red
nose
and
a
very
blotchy
face
.
``
Gospel
truth
!
All
they
do
*NL*
is
to
get
hold
of
our
good
Russian
money
free
,
gratis
,
and
for
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
you
're
quite
wrong
in
my
particular
instance
,
''
said
the
Swiss
*NL*
patient
,
quietly
.
``
Of
course
I
ca
n't
argue
the
matter
,
because
I
*NL*
know
only
my
own
case
;
but
my
doctor
gave
me
money
--
and
he
had
very
*NL*
little
--
to
pay
my
journey
back
,
besides
having
kept
me
at
his
own
*NL*
expense
,
while
there
,
for
nearly
two
years
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
Was
there
no
one
else
to
pay
for
you
?
''
asked
the
black-haired
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
Mr.
Pavlicheff
,
who
had
been
supporting
me
there
,
died
a
couple
*NL*
of
years
ago
.
I
wrote
to
Mrs.
General
Epanchin
at
the
time
-LRB-
she
is
a
*NL*
distant
relative
of
mine
-RRB-
,
but
she
did
not
answer
my
letter
.
And
so
*NL*
eventually
I
came
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
where
have
you
come
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
--
where
am
I
going
to
stay
?
I
--
I
really
do
n't
quite
know
yet
,
*NL*
I
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Both
the
listeners
laughed
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
your
whole
set-up
is
in
that
bundle
,
then
?
''
asked
the
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
bet
anything
it
is
!
''
exclaimed
the
red-nosed
passenger
,
with
*NL*
extreme
satisfaction
,
``
and
that
he
has
precious
little
in
the
luggage
*NL*
van
!
--
though
of
course
poverty
is
no
crime
--
we
must
remember
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
appeared
that
it
was
indeed
as
they
had
surmised
.
The
young
fellow
*NL*
hastened
to
admit
the
fact
with
wonderful
readiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
bundle
has
some
importance
,
however
,
''
continued
the
clerk
,
when
*NL*
they
had
laughed
their
fill
-LRB-
it
was
observable
that
the
subject
of
their
*NL*
mirth
joined
in
the
laughter
when
he
saw
them
laughing
-RRB-
;
``
for
though
I
*NL*
dare
say
it
is
not
stuffed
full
of
friedrichs
d'or
and
louis
d'or
--
judge
*NL*
from
your
costume
and
gaiters
--
still
--
if
you
can
add
to
your
possessions
*NL*
such
a
valuable
property
as
a
relation
like
Mrs.
General
Epanchin
,
then
*NL*
your
bundle
becomes
a
significant
object
at
once
.
That
is
,
of
course
,
if
*NL*
you
really
are
a
relative
of
Mrs.
Epanchin
's
,
and
have
not
made
a
little
*NL*
error
through
--
well
,
absence
of
mind
,
which
is
very
common
to
human
*NL*
beings
;
or
,
say
--
through
a
too
luxuriant
fancy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
are
right
again
,
''
said
the
fair-haired
traveller
,
``
for
I
*NL*
really
am
_
almost
_
wrong
when
I
say
she
and
I
are
related
.
She
is
hardly
*NL*
a
relation
at
all
;
so
little
,
in
fact
,
that
I
was
not
in
the
least
*NL*
surprised
to
have
no
answer
to
my
letter
.
I
expected
as
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
H
'm
!
you
spent
your
postage
for
nothing
,
then
.
H
'm
!
you
are
candid
,
*NL*
however
--
and
that
is
commendable
.
H
'm
!
Mrs.
Epanchin
--
oh
yes
!
a
most
*NL*
eminent
person
.
I
know
her
.
As
for
Mr.
Pavlicheff
,
who
supported
you
in
*NL*
Switzerland
,
I
know
him
too
--
at
least
,
if
it
was
Nicolai
Andreevitch
*NL*
of
that
name
?
A
fine
fellow
he
was
--
and
had
a
property
of
four
thousand
*NL*
souls
in
his
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Nicolai
Andreevitch
--
that
was
his
name
,
''
and
the
young
fellow
*NL*
looked
earnestly
and
with
curiosity
at
the
all-knowing
gentleman
with
*NL*
the
red
nose
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
sort
of
character
is
met
with
pretty
frequently
in
a
certain
class
.
*NL*
They
are
people
who
know
everyone
--
that
is
,
they
know
where
a
man
is
*NL*
employed
,
what
his
salary
is
,
whom
he
knows
,
whom
he
married
,
what
money
*NL*
his
wife
had
,
who
are
his
cousins
,
and
second
cousins
,
etc.
,
etc.
.
These
*NL*
men
generally
have
about
a
hundred
pounds
a
year
to
live
on
,
and
they
*NL*
spend
their
whole
time
and
talents
in
the
amassing
of
this
style
of
*NL*
knowledge
,
which
they
reduce
--
or
raise
--
to
the
standard
of
a
science
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
latter
part
of
the
conversation
the
black-haired
young
man
*NL*
had
become
very
impatient
.
He
stared
out
of
the
window
,
and
fidgeted
,
*NL*
and
evidently
longed
for
the
end
of
the
journey
.
He
was
very
absent
;
*NL*
he
would
appear
to
listen
--
and
heard
nothing
;
and
he
would
laugh
of
a
*NL*
sudden
,
evidently
with
no
idea
of
what
he
was
laughing
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
''
said
the
red-nosed
man
to
the
young
fellow
with
the
bundle
,
*NL*
rather
suddenly
;
``
whom
have
I
the
honour
to
be
talking
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Prince
Lef
Nicolaievitch
Muishkin
,
''
replied
the
latter
,
with
perfect
*NL*
readiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Prince
Muishkin
?
Lef
Nicolaievitch
?
H
'm
!
I
do
n't
know
,
I
'm
sure
!
I
may
*NL*
say
I
have
never
heard
of
such
a
person
,
''
said
the
clerk
,
thoughtfully
.
*NL*
``
At
least
,
the
name
,
I
admit
,
is
historical
.
Karamsin
must
mention
the
*NL*
family
name
,
of
course
,
in
his
history
--
but
as
an
individual
--
one
never
*NL*
hears
of
any
Prince
Muishkin
nowadays
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
not
,
''
replied
the
prince
;
``
there
are
none
,
except
myself
.
*NL*
I
believe
I
am
the
last
and
only
one
.
As
to
my
forefathers
,
they
have
*NL*
always
been
a
poor
lot
;
my
own
father
was
a
sublieutenant
in
the
army
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
how
Mrs.
Epanchin
comes
into
the
Muishkin
family
,
but
she
is
*NL*
descended
from
the
Princess
Muishkin
,
and
she
,
too
,
is
the
last
of
her
*NL*
line
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
did
you
learn
science
and
all
that
,
with
your
professor
over
*NL*
there
?
''
asked
the
black-haired
passenger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
--
I
did
learn
a
little
,
but
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
never
learned
anything
whatever

said
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
I
learned
very
little
,
you
know
!
''
added
the
prince
,
as
though
*NL*
excusing
himself
.
``
They
could
not
teach
me
very
much
on
account
of
my
*NL*
illness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
the
Rogojins
?
''
asked
his
questioner
,
abruptly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
n't
--
not
at
all
!
I
hardly
know
anyone
in
Russia
.
Why
,
is
that
*NL*
your
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
am
Rogojin
,
Parfen
Rogojin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Parfen
Rogojin
?
dear
me
--
then
do
n't
you
belong
to
those
very
Rogojins
,
*NL*
perhaps
--
''
began
the
clerk
,
with
a
very
perceptible
increase
of
civility
*NL*
in
his
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
those
very
ones
,
''
interrupted
Rogojin
,
impatiently
,
and
with
scant
*NL*
courtesy
.
I
may
remark
that
he
had
not
once
taken
any
notice
of
the
*NL*
blotchy-faced
passenger
,
and
had
hitherto
addressed
all
his
remarks
*NL*
direct
to
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
me
--
is
it
possible
?
''
observed
the
clerk
,
while
his
face
assumed
an
*NL*
expression
of
great
deference
and
servility
--
if
not
of
absolute
*NL*
alarm
:
``
what
,
a
son
of
that
very
Semen
Rogojin

hereditary
honourable
*NL*
citizen
--
who
died
a
month
or
so
ago
and
left
two
million
and
a
half
of
*NL*
roubles
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
do
_
you
_
know
that
he
left
two
million
and
a
half
of
roubles
?
''
*NL*
asked
Rogojin
,
disdainfully
,
and
not
deigning
so
much
as
to
look
at
the
*NL*
other
.
``
However
,
it
's
true
enough
that
my
father
died
a
month
ago
,
and
*NL*
that
here
am
I
returning
from
Pskoff
,
a
month
after
,
with
hardly
a
boot
*NL*
to
my
foot
.
They
've
treated
me
like
a
dog
!
I
've
been
ill
of
fever
at
*NL*
Pskoff
the
whole
time
,
and
not
a
line
,
nor
farthing
of
money
,
have
I
*NL*
received
from
my
mother
or
my
confounded
brother
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
you
'll
have
a
million
roubles
,
at
least
--
goodness
gracious
me
!
''
*NL*
exclaimed
the
clerk
,
rubbing
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Five
weeks
since
,
I
was
just
like
yourself
,
''
continued
Rogojin
,
*NL*
addressing
the
prince
,
``
with
nothing
but
a
bundle
and
the
clothes
I
*NL*
wore
.
I
ran
away
from
my
father
and
came
to
Pskoff
to
my
aunt
's
house
,
*NL*
where
I
caved
in
at
once
with
fever
,
and
he
went
and
died
while
I
was
*NL*
away
.
All
honour
to
my
respected
father
's
memory
--
but
he
uncommonly
*NL*
nearly
killed
me
,
all
the
same
.
Give
you
my
word
,
prince
,
if
I
had
n't
*NL*
cut
and
run
then
,
when
I
did
,
he
'd
have
murdered
me
like
a
dog
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
angered
him
somehow
?
''
asked
the
prince
,
looking
at
the
*NL*
millionaire
with
considerable
curiosity
.
But
though
there
may
have
been
*NL*
something
remarkable
in
the
fact
that
this
man
was
heir
to
millions
of
*NL*
roubles
there
was
something
about
him
which
surprised
and
interested
*NL*
the
prince
more
than
that
.
Rogojin
,
too
,
seemed
to
have
taken
up
the
*NL*
conversation
with
unusual
alacrity
it
appeared
that
he
was
still
in
a
*NL*
considerable
state
of
excitement
,
if
not
absolutely
feverish
,
and
was
*NL*
in
real
need
of
someone
to
talk
to
for
the
mere
sake
of
talking
,
as
*NL*
safety-valve
to
his
agitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
his
red-nosed
neighbour
,
the
latter
--
since
the
information
as
to
*NL*
the
identity
of
Rogojin
--
hung
over
him
,
seemed
to
be
living
on
the
*NL*
honey
of
his
words
and
in
the
breath
of
his
nostrils
,
catching
at
every
*NL*
syllable
as
though
it
were
a
pearl
of
great
price
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
;
I
angered
him
--
I
certainly
did
anger
him
,
''
replied
Rogojin
.
*NL*
``
But
what
puts
me
out
so
is
my
brother
.
Of
course
my
mother
could
n't
do
*NL*
anything
--
she
's
too
old
--
and
whatever
brother
Senka
says
is
law
for
her
!
*NL*
But
why
could
n't
he
let
me
know
?
He
sent
a
telegram
,
they
say
.
What
's
*NL*
the
good
of
a
telegram
?
It
frightened
my
aunt
so
that
she
sent
it
back
*NL*
to
the
office
unopened
,
and
there
it
's
been
ever
since
!
It
's
only
thanks
*NL*
to
Konief
that
I
heard
at
all
;
he
wrote
me
all
about
it
.
He
says
my
*NL*
brother
cut
off
the
gold
tassels
from
my
father
's
coffin
,
at
night
*NL*
`
because
they
're
worth
a
lot
of
money
!
'
says
he
.
Why
,
I
can
get
him
*NL*
sent
off
to
Siberia
for
that
alone
,
if
I
like
;
it
's
sacrilege
.
Here
,
*NL*
you
--
scarecrow
!
''
he
added
,
addressing
the
clerk
at
his
side
,
``
is
it
*NL*
sacrilege
or
not
,
by
law
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sacrilege
,
certainly
--
certainly
sacrilege
,
''
said
the
latter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
it
's
Siberia
for
sacrilege
,
is
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Undoubtedly
so
;
Siberia
,
of
course
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
will
think
that
I
'm
still
ill
,
''
continued
Rogojin
to
the
prince
,
*NL*
``
but
I
sloped
off
quietly
,
seedy
as
I
was
,
took
the
train
and
came
away
.
*NL*
Aha
,
brother
Senka
,
you
'll
have
to
open
your
gates
and
let
me
in
,
my
*NL*
boy
!
I
know
he
told
tales
about
me
to
my
father
--
I
know
that
well
enough
*NL*
but
I
certainly
did
rile
my
father
about
Nastasia
Philipovna
that
's
very
*NL*
sure
,
and
that
was
my
own
doing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nastasia
Philipovna
?
''
said
the
clerk
,
as
though
trying
to
think
out
*NL*
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
you
know
nothing
about
_
her
_
,
''
said
Rogojin
,
impatiently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
supposing
I
do
know
something
?
''
observed
the
other
,
triumphantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bosh
!
there
are
plenty
of
Nastasia
Philipovnas
.
And
what
an
impertinent
*NL*
beast
you
are
!
''
he
added
angrily
.
``
I
thought
some
creature
like
you
*NL*
would
hang
on
to
me
as
soon
as
I
got
hold
of
my
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
I
do
know
,
as
it
happens
,
''
said
the
clerk
in
an
aggravating
*NL*
manner
.
``
Lebedeff
knows
all
about
her
.
You
are
pleased
to
reproach
me
,
*NL*
your
excellency
,
but
what
if
I
prove
that
I
am
right
after
all
?
Nastasia
*NL*
Phillpovna
's
family
name
is
Barashkoff
--
I
know
,
you
see
--
and
she
is
a
*NL*
very
well
known
lady
,
indeed
,
and
comes
of
a
good
family
,
too
.
She
is
*NL*
connected
with
one
Totski
,
Afanasy
Ivanovitch
,
a
man
of
considerable
*NL*
property
,
a
director
of
companies
,
and
so
on
,
and
a
great
friend
of
*NL*
General
Epanchin
,
who
is
interested
in
the
same
matters
as
he
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
eyes
!
''
said
Rogojin
,
really
surprised
at
last
.
``
The
devil
take
the
*NL*
fellow
,
how
does
he
know
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
he
knows
everything
--
Lebedeff
knows
everything
!
I
was
a
month
or
*NL*
two
with
Lihachof
after
his
father
died
,
your
excellency
,
and
while
he
*NL*
was
knocking
about
--
he
's
in
the
debtor
's
prison
now
--
I
was
with
him
,
*NL*
and
he
could
n't
do
a
thing
without
Lebedeff
;
and
I
got
to
know
Nastasia
*NL*
Philipovna
and
several
people
at
that
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nastasia
Philipovna
?
Why
,
you
do
n't
mean
to
say
that
she
and
*NL*
Lihachof
--
''
cried
Rogojin
,
turning
quite
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
no
,
no
,
no
!
Nothing
of
the
sort
,
I
assure
you
!
''
said
Lebedeff
,
*NL*
hastily
.
``
Oh
dear
no
,
not
for
the
world
!
Totski
's
the
only
man
with
any
*NL*
chance
there
.
Oh
,
no
!
He
takes
her
to
his
box
at
the
opera
at
the
French
*NL*
theatre
of
an
evening
,
and
the
officers
and
people
all
look
at
her
and
*NL*
say
,
`
By
Jove
,
there
's
the
famous
Nastasia
Philipovna
!
'
but
no
one
ever
*NL*
gets
any
further
than
that
,
for
there
is
nothing
more
to
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
's
quite
true
,
''
said
Rogojin
,
frowning
gloomily
;
``
so
Zaleshoff
*NL*
told
me
.
I
was
walking
about
the
Nefsky
one
fine
day
,
prince
,
in
my
*NL*
father
's
old
coat
,
when
she
suddenly
came
out
of
a
shop
and
stepped
*NL*
into
her
carriage
.
I
swear
I
was
all
of
a
blaze
at
once
.
Then
I
met
*NL*
Zaleshoff
--
looking
like
a
hair-dresser
's
assistant
,
got
up
as
fine
as
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
who
,
while
I
looked
like
a
tinker
.
`
Do
n't
flatter
yourself
,
*NL*
my
boy
,
'
said
he
;
`
she
's
not
for
such
as
you
;
she
's
a
princess
,
she
*NL*
is
,
and
her
name
is
Nastasia
Philipovna
Barashkoff
,
and
she
lives
*NL*
with
Totski
,
who
wishes
to
get
rid
of
her
because
he
's
growing
rather
*NL*
old
--
fifty-five
or
so
--
and
wants
to
marry
a
certain
beauty
,
the
*NL*
loveliest
woman
in
all
Petersburg
.
'
And
then
he
told
me
that
I
could
*NL*
see
Nastasia
Philipovna
at
the
opera-house
that
evening
,
if
I
liked
,
and
*NL*
described
which
was
her
box
.
Well
,
I
'd
like
to
see
my
father
allowing
*NL*
any
of
us
to
go
to
the
theatre
;
he
'd
sooner
have
killed
us
,
any
day
.
*NL*
However
,
I
went
for
an
hour
or
so
and
saw
Nastasia
Philipovna
,
and
I
*NL*
never
slept
a
wink
all
night
after
.
Next
morning
my
father
happened
to
*NL*
give
me
two
government
loan
bonds
to
sell
,
worth
nearly
five
thousand
*NL*
roubles
each
.
`
Sell
them
,
'
said
he
,
`
and
then
take
seven
thousand
five
*NL*
hundred
roubles
to
the
office
,
give
them
to
the
cashier
,
and
bring
me
*NL*
back
the
rest
of
the
ten
thousand
,
without
looking
in
anywhere
on
the
*NL*
way
;
look
sharp
,
I
shall
be
waiting
for
you
.
'
Well
,
I
sold
the
bonds
,
*NL*
but
I
did
n't
take
the
seven
thousand
roubles
to
the
office
;
I
went
*NL*
straight
to
the
English
shop
and
chose
a
pair
of
earrings
,
with
a
*NL*
diamond
the
size
of
a
nut
in
each
.
They
cost
four
hundred
roubles
more
*NL*
than
I
had
,
so
I
gave
my
name
,
and
they
trusted
me
.
With
the
earrings
*NL*
I
went
at
once
to
Zaleshoff
's
.
`
Come
on
!
'
I
said
,
`
come
on
to
Nastasia
*NL*
Philipovna
's
,
'
and
off
we
went
without
more
ado
.
I
tell
you
I
had
n't
a
*NL*
notion
of
what
was
about
me
or
before
me
or
below
my
feet
all
the
way
;
*NL*
I
saw
nothing
whatever
.
We
went
straight
into
her
drawing-room
,
and
then
*NL*
she
came
out
to
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
say
right
out
who
I
was
,
but
Zaleshoff
said
:
`
From
Parfen
*NL*
Rogojin
,
in
memory
of
his
first
meeting
with
you
yesterday
;
be
so
kind
*NL*
as
to
accept
these
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
opened
the
parcel
,
looked
at
the
earrings
,
and
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Thank
your
friend
Mr.
Rogojin
for
his
kind
attention
,
'
says
she
,
and
*NL*
bowed
and
went
off
.
Why
did
n't
I
die
there
on
the
spot
?
The
worst
of
it
*NL*
all
was
,
though
,
that
the
beast
Zaleshoff
got
all
the
credit
of
it
!
I
*NL*
was
short
and
abominably
dressed
,
and
stood
and
stared
in
her
face
and
*NL*
never
said
a
word
,
because
I
was
shy
,
like
an
ass
!
And
there
was
he
all
*NL*
in
the
fashion
,
pomaded
and
dressed
out
,
with
a
smart
tie
on
,
bowing
and
*NL*
scraping
;
and
I
bet
anything
she
took
him
for
me
all
the
while
!
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Look
here
now
,
'
I
said
,
when
we
came
out
,
`
none
of
your
interference
*NL*
here
after
this-do
you
understand
?
'
He
laughed
:
`
And
how
are
you
going
*NL*
to
settle
up
with
your
father
?
'
says
he
.
I
thought
I
might
as
well
jump
*NL*
into
the
Neva
at
once
without
going
home
first
;
but
it
struck
me
that
I
*NL*
would
n't
,
after
all
,
and
I
went
home
feeling
like
one
of
the
damned
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
goodness
!
''
shivered
the
clerk
.
``
And
his
father
,
''
he
added
,
for
the
*NL*
prince
's
instruction
,
``
and
his
father
would
have
given
a
man
a
ticket
to
*NL*
the
other
world
for
ten
roubles
any
day
--
not
to
speak
of
ten
thousand
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
observed
Rogojin
with
great
curiosity
;
he
seemed
paler
than
*NL*
ever
at
this
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
know
about
it
?
''
cried
the
latter
.
``
Well
,
my
father
learned
*NL*
the
whole
story
at
once
,
and
Zaleshoff
blabbed
it
all
over
the
town
*NL*
besides
.
So
he
took
me
upstairs
and
locked
me
up
,
and
swore
at
me
for
an
*NL*
hour
.
`
This
is
only
a
foretaste
,
'
says
he
;
`
wait
a
bit
till
night
comes
,
*NL*
and
I
'll
come
back
and
talk
to
you
again
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
do
you
think
?
The
old
fellow
went
straight
off
to
Nastasia
*NL*
Philipovna
,
touched
the
floor
with
his
forehead
,
and
began
blubbering
*NL*
and
beseeching
her
on
his
knees
to
give
him
back
the
diamonds
.
So
after
*NL*
awhile
she
brought
the
box
and
flew
out
at
him
.
`
There
,
'
she
says
,
*NL*
`
take
your
earrings
,
you
wretched
old
miser
;
although
they
are
ten
times
*NL*
dearer
than
their
value
to
me
now
that
I
know
what
it
must
have
cost
*NL*
Parfen
to
get
them
!
Give
Parfen
my
compliments
,
'
she
says
,
`
and
thank
*NL*
him
very
much
!
'
Well
,
I
meanwhile
had
borrowed
twenty-five
roubles
from
*NL*
a
friend
,
and
off
I
went
to
Pskoff
to
my
aunt
's
.
The
old
woman
there
*NL*
lectured
me
so
that
I
left
the
house
and
went
on
a
drinking
tour
round
*NL*
the
public-houses
of
the
place
.
I
was
in
a
high
fever
when
I
got
to
*NL*
Pskoff
,
and
by
nightfall
I
was
lying
delirious
in
the
streets
somewhere
*NL*
or
other
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oho
!
we
'll
make
Nastasia
Philipovna
sing
another
song
now
!
''
giggled
*NL*
Lebedeff
,
rubbing
his
hands
with

``
Hey
,
my
boy

we
'll

proper

such
earrings

*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
,
''
cried
Rogojin
,
seizing
him
fiercely
by
the
arm
,
``
look
here
,
*NL*
if
you
so
much
as
name
Nastasia
Philipovna
again
,
I
'll
tan
your
hide
as
*NL*
sure
as
you
sit
there

*NL*
*NL*
``
Aha
!
do
--
by
all
means
!
if
you
tan
my
hide
you
wo
n't
turn
me
away
from
*NL*
your
society

You
'll
bind
me
to
you
,
with
your
lash
,
for
ever

Ha
,
ha
!
*NL*
here
we
are
at
the
station
,
though

''
*NL*
*NL*
Sure
enough
,
the
train
was
just
steaming
in
as
he
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
Rogojin
had
declared
that
he
left
Pskoff
secretly
,
a
large
*NL*
collection
of
friends
had
assembled
to
greet
him
,
and
did
so
with
*NL*
profuse
waving
of
hats
and
shouting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
there
's
Zaleshoff
here
,
too
!
''
he
muttered
,
gazing
at
the
scene
*NL*
with
a
sort
of
triumphant
but
unpleasant
smile
.
Then
he
suddenly
turned
*NL*
to
the
prince
:
``
Prince
,
I
do
n't
know
why
I
have
taken
a
fancy
to
you
;
*NL*
perhaps
because
I
met
you
just
when
I
did
.
But
no
,
it
ca
n't
be
that
,
for
*NL*
I
met
this
fellow
''
-LRB-
nodding
at
Lebedeff
-RRB-
``
too
,
and
I
have
not
taken
a
*NL*
fancy
to
him
by
any
means
.
Come
to
see
me
,
prince
;
we
'll
take
off
those
*NL*
gaiters
of
yours
and
dress
you
up
in
a
smart
fur
coat
,
the
best
we
*NL*
can
buy

You
shall
have
a
dress
coat
,
best
quality
,
white
waistcoat
,
*NL*
anything
you
like

and
your
pocket
shall
be
full
of
money

Come
,
and
*NL*
you
shall
go
with
me
to
Nastasia
Philipovna

Now
then
will
you
come
or
*NL*
no
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Accept
,
accept

Prince
Lef
Nicolaievitch
''
said
Lebedef
solemnly
;
``
do
n't
*NL*
let
it
slip
!
Accept
,
quick
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Muishkin
rose
and
stretched
out
his
hand
courteously
,
while
he
*NL*
replied
with
some
cordiality
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
come
with
the
greatest
pleasure
,
and
thank
you
very
much
for
*NL*
taking
a
fancy
to
me
.
I
dare
say
I
may
even
come
today
if
I
have
time
,
*NL*
for
I
tell
you
frankly
that
I
like
you
very
much
too
.
I
liked
you
*NL*
especially
when
you
told
us
about
the
diamond
earrings
;
but
I
liked
you
*NL*
before
that
as
well
,
though
you
have
such
a
dark-clouded
sort
of
face
.
*NL*
Thanks
very
much
for
the
offer
of
clothes
and
a
fur
coat
;
I
certainly
*NL*
shall
require
both
clothes
and
coat
very
soon
.
As
for
money
,
I
have
*NL*
hardly
a
copeck
about
me
at
this
moment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
shall
have
lots
of
money
;
by
the
evening
I
shall
have
plenty
;
so
*NL*
come
along
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
true
enough
,
he
'll
have
lots
before
evening
!
''
put
in
Lebedeff
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
look
here
,
are
you
a
great
hand
with
the
ladies
?
Let
's
know
that
*NL*
first
?
''
asked
Rogojin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
oh
no
!
''
said
the
prince
;
``
I
could
n't
,
you
know
--
my
illness
--
I
*NL*
hardly
ever
saw
a
soul
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
H
'm
!
well
--
here
,
you
fellow-you
can
come
along
with
me
now
if
you
*NL*
like
!
''
cried
Rogojin
to
Lebedeff
,
and
so
they
all
left
the
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lebedeff
had
his
desire
.
He
went
off
with
the
noisy
group
of
Rogojin
's
*NL*
friends
towards
the
Voznesensky
,
while
the
prince
's
route
lay
towards
*NL*
the
Litaynaya
.
It
was
damp
and
wet
.
The
prince
asked
his
way
of
*NL*
passers-by
,
and
finding
that
he
was
a
couple
of
miles
or
so
from
his
*NL*
destination
,
he
determined
to
take
a
droshky
.
*NL*
*NL*
II
.
*NL*
*NL*
General
Epanchin
lived
in
his
own
house
near
the
Litaynaya
.
Besides
this
*NL*
large
residence
--
five-sixths
of
which
was
let
in
flats
and
lodgings-the
*NL*
general
was
owner
of
another
enormous
house
in
the
Sadovaya
bringing
in
*NL*
even
more
rent
than
the
first
.
Besides
these
houses
he
had
a
delightful
*NL*
little
estate
just
out
of
town
,
and
some
sort
of
factory
in
another
part
*NL*
of
the
city
.
General
Epanchin
,
as
everyone
knew
,
had
a
good
deal
to
*NL*
do
with
certain
government
monopolies
;
he
was
also
a
voice
,
and
an
*NL*
important
one
,
in
many
rich
public
companies
of
various
descriptions
;
*NL*
in
fact
,
he
enjoyed
the
reputation
of
being
a
well-to-do
man
of
busy
*NL*
habits
,
many
ties
,
and
affluent
means
.
He
had
made
himself
indispensable
*NL*
in
several
quarters
,
amongst
others
in
his
department
of
the
government
;
*NL*
and
yet
it
was
a
known
fact
that
Fedor
Ivanovitch
Epanchin
was
a
man
of
*NL*
no
education
whatever
,
and
had
absolutely
risen
from
the
ranks
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
last
fact
could
,
of
course
,
reflect
nothing
but
credit
upon
the
*NL*
general
;
and
yet
,
though
unquestionably
a
sagacious
man
,
he
had
his
own
*NL*
little
weaknesses-very
excusable
ones
,
--
one
of
which
was
a
dislike
to
*NL*
any
allusion
to
the
above
circumstance
.
He
was
undoubtedly
clever
.
For
*NL*
instance
,
he
made
a
point
of
never
asserting
himself
when
he
would
*NL*
gain
more
by
keeping
in
the
background
;
and
in
consequence
many
exalted
*NL*
personages
valued
him
principally
for
his
humility
and
simplicity
,
and
*NL*
because
``
he
knew
his
place
.
''
And
yet
if
these
good
people
could
only
*NL*
have
had
a
peep
into
the
mind
of
this
excellent
fellow
who
``
knew
his
*NL*
place
''
so
well
!
The
fact
is
that
,
in
spite
of
his
knowledge
of
the
world
*NL*
and
his
really
remarkable
abilities
,
he
always
liked
to
appear
to
be
*NL*
carrying
out
other
people
's
ideas
rather
than
his
own
.
And
also
,
his
*NL*
luck
seldom
failed
him
,
even
at
cards
,
for
which
he
had
a
passion
that
*NL*
he
did
not
attempt
to
conceal
.
He
played
for
high
stakes
,
and
moved
,
*NL*
altogether
,
in
very
varied
society
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
age
,
General
Epanchin
was
in
the
very
prime
of
life
;
that
is
,
*NL*
about
fifty-five
years
of
age
,
--
the
flowering
time
of
existence
,
when
*NL*
real
enjoyment
of
life
begins
.
His
healthy
appearance
,
good
colour
,
*NL*
sound
,
though
discoloured
teeth
,
sturdy
figure
,
preoccupied
air
during
*NL*
business
hours
,
and
jolly
good
humour
during
his
game
at
cards
in
the
*NL*
evening
,
all
bore
witness
to
his
success
in
life
,
and
combined
to
make
*NL*
existence
a
bed
of
roses
to
his
excellency
.
The
general
was
lord
of
a
*NL*
flourishing
family
,
consisting
of
his
wife
and
three
grown-up
daughters
.
*NL*
He
had
married
young
,
while
still
a
lieutenant
,
his
wife
being
a
girl
of
*NL*
about
his
own
age
,
who
possessed
neither
beauty
nor
education
,
and
who
*NL*
brought
him
no
more
than
fifty
souls
of
landed
property
,
which
*NL*
little
estate
served
,
however
,
as
a
nest-egg
for
far
more
important
*NL*
accumulations
.
The
general
never
regretted
his
early
marriage
,
or
*NL*
regarded
it
as
a
foolish
youthful
escapade
;
and
he
so
respected
and
*NL*
feared
his
wife
that
he
was
very
near
loving
her
.
Mrs.
Epanchin
came
of
*NL*
the
princely
stock
of
Muishkin
,
which
if
not
a
brilliant
,
was
,
at
all
*NL*
events
,
a
decidedly
ancient
family
;
and
she
was
extremely
proud
of
her
*NL*
descent
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
few
exceptions
,
the
worthy
couple
had
lived
through
their
long
*NL*
union
very
happily
.
While
still
young
the
wife
had
been
able
to
make
*NL*
important
friends
among
the
aristocracy
,
partly
by
virtue
of
her
family
*NL*
descent
,
and
partly
by
her
own
exertions
;
while
,
in
after
life
,
thanks
*NL*
to
their
wealth
and
to
the
position
of
her
husband
in
the
service
,
she
*NL*
took
her
place
among
the
higher
circles
as
by
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
these
last
few
years
all
three
of
the
general
's
*NL*
daughters
--
Alexandra
,
Adelaida
,
and
Aglaya
--
had
grown
up
and
matured
.
Of
*NL*
course
they
were
only
Epanchins
,
but
their
mother
's
family
was
noble
;
*NL*
they
might
expect
considerable
fortunes
;
their
father
had
hopes
of
*NL*
attaining
to
very
high
rank
indeed
in
his
country
's
service-all
of
which
*NL*
was
satisfactory
.
All
three
of
the
girls
were
decidedly
pretty
,
even
*NL*
the
eldest
,
Alexandra
,
who
was
just
twenty-five
years
old
.
The
middle
*NL*
daughter
was
now
twenty-three
,
while
the
youngest
,
Aglaya
,
was
twenty
.
*NL*
This
youngest
girl
was
absolutely
a
beauty
,
and
had
begun
of
late
to
*NL*
attract
considerable
attention
in
society
.
But
this
was
not
all
,
for
*NL*
every
one
of
the
three
was
clever
,
well
educated
,
and
accomplished
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
matter
of
general
knowledge
that
the
three
girls
were
very
fond
*NL*
of
one
another
,
and
supported
each
other
in
every
way
;
it
was
even
said
*NL*
that
the
two
elder
ones
had
made
certain
sacrifices
for
the
sake
of
*NL*
the
idol
of
the
household
,
Aglaya
.
In
society
they
not
only
disliked
*NL*
asserting
themselves
,
but
were
actually
retiring
.
Certainly
no
one
could
*NL*
blame
them
for
being
too
arrogant
or
haughty
,
and
yet
everybody
was
well
*NL*
aware
that
they
were
proud
and
quite
understood
their
own
value
.
The
*NL*
eldest
was
musical
,
while
the
second
was
a
clever
artist
,
which
fact
*NL*
she
had
concealed
until
lately
.
In
a
word
,
the
world
spoke
well
of
the
*NL*
girls
;
but
they
were
not
without
their
enemies
,
and
occasionally
people
*NL*
talked
with
horror
of
the
number
of
books
they
had
read
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
in
no
hurry
to
marry
.
They
liked
good
society
,
but
were
not
*NL*
too
keen
about
it
.
All
this
was
the
more
remarkable
,
because
everyone
*NL*
was
well
aware
of
the
hopes
and
aims
of
their
parents
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
about
eleven
o'clock
in
the
forenoon
when
the
prince
rang
the
*NL*
bell
at
General
Epanchin
's
door
.
The
general
lived
on
the
first
floor
*NL*
or
flat
of
the
house
,
as
modest
a
lodging
as
his
position
permitted
.
A
*NL*
liveried
servant
opened
the
door
,
and
the
prince
was
obliged
to
enter
*NL*
into
long
explanations
with
this
gentleman
,
who
,
from
the
first
glance
,
*NL*
looked
at
him
and
his
bundle
with
grave
suspicion
.
At
last
,
however
,
on
*NL*
the
repeated
positive
assurance
that
he
really
was
Prince
Muishkin
,
and
*NL*
must
absolutely
see
the
general
on
business
,
the
bewildered
domestic
*NL*
showed
him
into
a
little
ante-chamber
leading
to
a
waiting-room
that
*NL*
adjoined
the
general
's
study
,
there
handing
him
over
to
another
servant
,
*NL*
whose
duty
it
was
to
be
in
this
ante-chamber
all
the
morning
,
and
*NL*
announce
visitors
to
the
general
.
This
second
individual
wore
a
dress
*NL*
coat
,
and
was
some
forty
years
of
age
;
he
was
the
general
's
special
*NL*
study
servant
,
and
well
aware
of
his
own
importance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
in
the
next
room
,
please
;
and
leave
your
bundle
here
,
''
said
the
*NL*
door-keeper
,
as
he
sat
down
comfortably
in
his
own
easy-chair
in
the
*NL*
ante-chamber
.
He
looked
at
the
prince
in
severe
surprise
as
the
latter
*NL*
settled
himself
in
another
chair
alongside
,
with
his
bundle
on
his
*NL*
knees
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
do
n't
mind
,
I
would
rather
sit
here
with
you
,
''
said
the
prince
;
*NL*
``
I
should
prefer
it
to
sitting
in
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
you
ca
n't
stay
here
.
You
are
a
visitor
--
a
guest
,
so
to
speak
.
*NL*
Is
it
the
general
himself
you
wish
to
see
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
evidently
could
not
take
in
the
idea
of
such
a
shabby-looking
*NL*
visitor
,
and
had
decided
to
ask
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
I
have
business
--
''
began
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
ask
you
what
your
business
may
be
,
all
I
have
to
do
is
to
*NL*
announce
you
;
and
unless
the
secretary
comes
in
here
I
can
not
do
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
's
suspicions
seemed
to
increase
more
and
more
.
The
prince
was
*NL*
too
unlike
the
usual
run
of
daily
visitors
;
and
although
the
general
*NL*
certainly
did
receive
,
on
business
,
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
men
,
yet
*NL*
in
spite
of
this
fact
the
servant
felt
great
doubts
on
the
subject
*NL*
of
this
particular
visitor
.
The
presence
of
the
secretary
as
an
*NL*
intermediary
was
,
he
judged
,
essential
in
this
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
you
--
are
from
abroad
?
''
he
inquired
at
last
,
in
a
confused
sort
*NL*
of
way
.
He
had
begun
his
sentence
intending
to
say
,
``
Surely
you
are
not
*NL*
Prince
Muishkin
,
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
straight
from
the
train
!
Did
not
you
intend
to
say
,
`
Surely
you
*NL*
are
not
Prince
Muishkin
?
'
just
now
,
but
refrained
out
of
politeness
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
H
'm
!
''
grunted
the
astonished
servant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
assure
you
I
am
not
deceiving
you
;
you
shall
not
have
to
answer
for
*NL*
me
.
As
to
my
being
dressed
like
this
,
and
carrying
a
bundle
,
there
's
*NL*
nothing
surprising
in
that
--
the
fact
is
,
my

at

*NL*
*NL*
``

no

I
'm
not
afraid
of
that

you
see

I
have
to
announce
you

all

The

will
be
out

the

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

no

you

another

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

my
asking

Your
appearance
led
me
to

think

just
wait
for
the
secretary

the
general
is
busy
now

the

come
out

some
time
to
wait

would
you
mind
*NL*
telling

is
there
any
place
about
where
I

I
have
*NL*
my
pipe

tobacco
with
me

*NL*
*NL*

Smoke

said
the
man
,
in
shocked
but
disdainful
surprise
,
blinking
his
*NL*
eyes
at
the
prince
as
though
he
could
not
believe
his
senses
.
``
No
,
sir
,
*NL*
you
can
not
smoke
here
,
and
I
wonder
you
are
not
ashamed
of
the
very
*NL*
suggestion
.
Ha
,
ha
!
a
cool
idea
that
,
I
declare
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
did

mean
in
this
room

know

*NL*
I
'd
adjourn
to
some
other
room

wherever
you
like
to
show
me
to
.
You
*NL*
see
,
I
'm
used
to
smoking
a
good
deal
,
and
now
I
have
n't
had
a
puff
for
*NL*
three
hours
;
however
,
just
as
you
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
how
on
earth
am
I
to
announce
a
man
like
that
?
''
muttered
the
*NL*
servant
.
``
In
the
first
place
,
you
've
no
right
in
here
at
all
;
you
ought
*NL*
to
be
in
the
waiting-room
,
because
you
're
a
sort
of
visitor
--
a
guest
,
in
*NL*
fact
--
and
I
shall
catch
it
for
this
.
Look
here
,
do
you
intend
to
take
up
*NL*
you
abode
with
us
?
''
he
added
,
glancing
once
more
at
the
prince
's
bundle
,
*NL*
which
evidently
gave
him
no
peace
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
n't
think
so
.
I
do
n't
think
I
should
stay
even
if
they
were
*NL*
to
invite
me
.
I
've
simply
come
to
make
their
acquaintance
,
and
nothing
*NL*
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Make
their
acquaintance
?
''
asked
the
man
,
in
amazement
,
and
with
*NL*
redoubled
suspicion
.
``
Then
why
did
you
say
you
had
business
with
the
*NL*
general
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
well
,
very
little
business
.
There
is
one
little
matter
--
some
*NL*
advice
I
am
going
to
ask
him
for
;
but
my
principal
object
is
simply
to
*NL*
introduce
myself
,
because
I
am
Prince
Muishkin
,
and
Madame
Epanchin
is
*NL*
the
last
of
her
branch
of
the
house
,
and
besides
herself
and
me
there
*NL*
are
no
other
Muishkins
left
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
--
you
're
a
relation
then
,
are
you
?
''
asked
the
servant
,
so
*NL*
bewildered
that
he
began
to
feel
quite
alarmed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
hardly
so
.
If
you
stretch
a
point
,
we
are
relations
,
of
course
,
*NL*
but
so
distant
that
one
can
not
really
take
cognizance
of
it
.
I
once
*NL*
wrote
to
your
mistress
from
abroad
,
but
she
did
not
reply
.
However
,
I
*NL*
have
thought
it
right
to
make
acquaintance
with
her
on
my
arrival
.
I
am
*NL*
telling
you
all
this
in
order
to
ease
your
mind
,
for
I
see
you
are
still
*NL*
far
from
comfortable
on
my
account
.
All
you
have
to
do
is
to
announce
me
*NL*
as
Prince
Muishkin
,
and
the
object
of
my
visit
will
be
plain
enough
.
If
*NL*
I
am
received
--
very
good
;
if
not
,
well
,
very
good
again
.
But
they
are
*NL*
sure
to
receive
me
,
I
should
think
;
Madame
Epanchin
will
naturally
be
*NL*
curious
to
see
the
only
remaining
representative
of
her
family
.
She
*NL*
values
her
Muishkin
descent
very
highly
,
if
I
am
rightly
informed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
's
conversation
was
artless
and
confiding
to
a
degree
,
and
*NL*
the
servant
could
not
help
feeling
that
as
from
visitor
to
common
*NL*
serving-man
this
state
of
things
was
highly
improper
.
His
conclusion
was
*NL*
that
one
of
two
things
must
be
the
explanation
--
either
that
this
was
a
*NL*
begging
impostor
,
or
that
the
prince
,
if
prince
he
were
,
was
simply
a
*NL*
fool
,
without
the
slightest
ambition
;
for
a
sensible
prince
with
any
*NL*
ambition
would
certainly
not
wait
about
in
ante-rooms
with
servants
,
and
*NL*
talk
of
his
own
private
affairs
like
this
.
In
either
case
,
how
was
he
to
*NL*
announce
this
singular
visitor
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
really
think
I
must
request
you
to
step
into
the
next
room
!
''
he
said
,
*NL*
with
all
the
insistence
he
could
muster
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
If
I
had
been
sitting
there
now
,
I
should
not
have
had
the
*NL*
opportunity
of
making
these
personal
explanations
.
I
see
you
are
still
*NL*
uneasy
about
me
and
keep
eyeing
my
cloak
and
bundle
.
Do
n't
you
think
*NL*
you
might
go
in
yourself
now
,
without
waiting
for
the
secretary
to
come
*NL*
out
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
!
I
ca
n't
announce
a
visitor
like
yourself
without
the
secretary
.
*NL*
Besides
the
general
said
he
was
not
to
be
disturbed
--
he
is
with
the
*NL*
Colonel
C
--
.
Gavrila
Ardalionovitch
goes
in
without
announcing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
may
that
be
?
a
clerk
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
Gavrila
Ardalionovitch
?
Oh
no
;
he
belongs
to
one
of
the
*NL*
companies
.
Look
here
,
at
all
events
put
your
bundle
down
,
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
will
if
I
may
;
and
--
can
I
take
off
my
cloak
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
;
you
ca
n't
go
in
_
there
_
with
it
on
,
anyhow

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
rose
and
took
off
his
mantle
,
revealing
a
neat
enough
morning
*NL*
costume
--
a
little
worn
,
but
well
made
.
He
wore
a
steel
watch
chain
and
*NL*
from
this
chain
there
hung
a
silver
Geneva
watch
.
Fool
the
prince
might
*NL*
be
,
still
,
the
general
's
servant
felt
that
it
was
not
correct
for
him
to
*NL*
continue
to
converse
thus
with
a
visitor
,
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
*NL*
prince
pleased
him
somehow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
time
of
day
does
the
lady
receive
?
''
the
latter
asked
,
*NL*
reseating
himself
in
his
old
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
's
not
in
_
my
_
province
!
I
believe
she
receives
at
any
time
;
it
*NL*
depends
upon
the
visitors
.
The
dressmaker
goes
in
at
eleven
.
Gavrila
*NL*
Ardalionovitch
is
allowed
much
earlier
than
other
people
,
too
;
he
is
*NL*
even
admitted
to
early
lunch
now
and
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
much
warmer
in
the
rooms
here
than
it
is
abroad
at
this
season
,
''
*NL*
observed
the
prince
;
``
but
it
is
much
warmer
there
out
of
doors

As
for
*NL*
the
houses

a
Russian

n't
live
in
them
in
the
winter
until
he
gets
*NL*
accustomed

them

*NL*
``
Do

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

them
a

*NL*
*NL*
``
H

were
you
long
away

*NL*
*NL*
``
Four

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

*NL*
``
Yes

keep

well

that
is
partly
why
I
am
so
talkative
this
morning

I
assure
*NL*
you
,
ever
since
yesterday
evening
I
have
had
the
strongest
desire

go

on

on
talking
Russian

*NL*
``
H

yes

did
you
live
in
Petersburg

former
years

*NL*
*NL*
This
good
flunkey
,
in
spite
of
his
conscientious
scruples
,
really
could
*NL*
not
resist
continuing
such
a
very
genteel
and
agreeable
conversation

*NL*
*NL*
``
In
Petersburg
?
Oh
no

hardly
at
all

now
they
say
so
much
is

changed
in
the
place
that
even
those
who
did
know
it
well
are
obliged
to

relearn
what

a
good

there

*NL*
*NL*
``
What

the

*NL*
*NL*
``

put

a
sort

broad
knife
falls
by
machinery

your

announce

sentence

prepare
the

tie
his
hands

and
cart
him
off
to
the
*NL*
scaffold

that
's
the
fearful
part

the
business

people
all
crowd

round

The
criminal
was
a
fine
intelligent

fearless
man

Le
Gros
was
his
name
;
and
I
may
tell
you
--
believe
it
or
*NL*
not
,
as
you
like

that
when
that
man
stepped
upon
the
scaffold
he
_
cried

,
*NL*
he
did
indeed
,
--
he
was
as
white
as
a
bit
of
paper

Is
n't
it
a
dreadful
*NL*
idea
that
he
should
have
cried

cried

Whoever
heard
of
a
grown
man
*NL*
crying
from
fear

not
a
child

a
man
who
never
had
cried
before

a
*NL*
grown
man
of
forty-five
years

Imagine
what
must
have
been
going
on
in
*NL*
that
man
's
mind
at
such
a
moment

what
dreadful
convulsions
his
whole
*NL*
spirit
must
have
endured
;
it
is
an
outrage
on
the
soul
that
's
what
it
*NL*
is

Because
it
is
said
`
thou
shalt
not
kill

is
he
to
be
killed
because
*NL*
he
murdered
some
one
else

No

it
is
not
right

it
's
an
impossible
*NL*
theory

I
assure
you
,
I
saw
the
sight
a
month
ago

it

dancing

before
my
eyes

dream
of
it

The
prince
had
grown
animated
as
he
spoke
,
and
a
tinge
of
colour
*NL*
suffused
his
pale
face
,
though
his
way
of
talking
was
as
quiet
as
ever
.
*NL*
The
servant
followed
his
words
with
sympathetic
interest
.
Clearly
he
*NL*
was
not
at
all
anxious
to
bring
the
conversation
to
an
end
.
Who
knows
?
*NL*
Perhaps
he
too
was
a
man
of
imagination
and
with
some
capacity
for
*NL*
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

at
all

it
is
a
good

flies
off

he
remarked

*NL*
``
Do

the

warmly

you
made

the
machine
is
designed

the
purpose
of
avoiding
pain

this
guillotine
I
mean
;
but
a
thought
came
*NL*
into
my
head
then
:
what
if
it
be
a
bad
plan
after
all
?
You
may
laugh
at
*NL*
my
idea

perhaps

I
could
not
help
its
occurring
to
me
all

Now
with
the
rack

tortures

so
on

you
suffer
terrible

then
your
torture
is
bodily
pain
only
-LRB-
although
no
doubt
you
*NL*
have
plenty
of
that
-RRB-
until
you
die

But
_
here
_
I
should
imagine
the
*NL*
most
terrible
part
of
the
whole
punishment
is
,
not
the
bodily
pain

all

the
certain
knowledge
that
in
an
hour

in
ten
minutes

*NL*
then
in
half
a
minute
,
then
now

this

your

must
*NL*
quit
your

that
you
will
no
longer
be
a
man
--
and
that
this
*NL*
is
certain
,
_
certain
_
!
That
's
the
point
--
the
certainty
of
it
.
Just
that
*NL*
instant
when
you
place
your
head
on
the
block
and
hear
the
iron
grate
*NL*
over
your
head
--
then
--
that
quarter
of
a
second
is
the
most
awful
of
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
not
my
own
fantastical
opinion
--
many
people
have
thought
the
*NL*
same
;
but
I
feel
it
so
deeply
that
I
'll
tell
you
what
I
think
.
I
believe
*NL*
that
to
execute
a
man
for
murder
is
to
punish
him
immeasurably
more
*NL*
dreadfully
than
is
equivalent
to
his
crime
.
A
murder
by
sentence
is
*NL*
far
more
dreadful
than
a
murder
committed
by
a
criminal
.
The
man
who
is
*NL*
attacked
by
robbers
at
night
,
in
a
dark
wood
,
or
anywhere
,
undoubtedly
*NL*
hopes
and
hopes
that
he
may
yet
escape
until
the
very
moment
of
his
*NL*
death
.
There
are
plenty
of
instances
of
a
man
running
away
,
or
imploring
*NL*
for
mercy
--
at
all
events
hoping
on
in
some
degree
--
even
after
his
throat
*NL*
was
cut
.
But
in
the
case
of
an
execution
,
that
last
hope
--
having
which
*NL*
it
is
so
immeasurably
less
dreadful
to
die
,
--
is
taken
away
from
the
*NL*
wretch
and
_
certainty
_
substituted
in
its
place
!
There
is
his
sentence
,
*NL*
and
with
it
that
terrible
certainty
that
he
can
not
possibly
escape
*NL*
death
--
which
,
I
consider
,
must
be
the
most
dreadful
anguish
in
the
*NL*
world
.
You
may
place
a
soldier
before
a
cannon
's
mouth
in
battle
,
and
*NL*
fire
upon
him
--
and
he
will
still
hope
.
But
read
to
that
same
soldier
his
*NL*
death-sentence
,
and
he
will
either
go
mad
or
burst
into
tears
.
Who
dares
*NL*
to
say
that
any
man
can
suffer
this
without
going
mad
?
No
,
no
!
it
is
*NL*
an
abuse
,
a
shame
,
it
is
unnecessary
--
why
should
such
a
thing
exist
?
*NL*
Doubtless
there
may
be
men
who
have
been
sentenced
,
who
have
suffered
*NL*
this
mental
anguish
for
a
while
and
then
have
been
reprieved
;
perhaps
*NL*
such
men
may
have
been
able
to
relate
their
feelings
afterwards
.
Our
*NL*
Lord
Christ
spoke
of
this
anguish
and
dread
.
No
!
no
!
no
!
No
man
should
*NL*
be
treated
so
,
no
man
,
no
man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
servant
,
though
of
course
he
could
not
have
expressed
all
this
*NL*
as
the
prince
did
,
still
clearly
entered
into
it
and
was
greatly
*NL*
conciliated
,
as
was
evident
from
the
increased
amiability
of
his
*NL*
expression
.
``
If
you
are
really
very
anxious
for
a
smoke
,
''
he
remarked
,
*NL*
``
I
think
it
might
possibly
be
managed
,
if
you
are
very
quick
about
it
.
*NL*
You
see
they
might
come
out
and
inquire
for
you
,
and
you
would
n't
be
on
*NL*
the
spot
.
You
see
that
door
there
?
Go
in
there
and
you
'll
find
a
little
*NL*
room
on
the
right
;
you
can
smoke
there
,
only
open
the
window
,
because
I
*NL*
ought
not
to
allow
it
really
,
and
--
.
''
But
there
was
no
time
,
after
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
young
fellow
entered
the
ante-room
at
this
moment
,
with
a
bundle
*NL*
of
papers
in
his
hand
.
The
footman
hastened
to
help
him
take
off
his
*NL*
overcoat
.
The
new
arrival
glanced
at
the
prince
out
of
the
corners
of
*NL*
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
gentleman
declares
,
Gavrila
Ardalionovitch
,
''
began
the
man
,
*NL*
confidentially
and
almost
familiarly
,
``
that
he
is
Prince
Muishkin
and
*NL*
a
relative
of
Madame
Epanchin
's
.
He
has
just
arrived
from
abroad
,
with
*NL*
nothing
but
a
bundle
by
way
of
luggage
--
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
did
not
hear
the
rest
,
because
at
this
point
the
servant
*NL*
continued
his
communication
in
a
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gavrila
Ardalionovitch
listened
attentively
,
and
gazed
at
the
prince
*NL*
with
great
curiosity
.
At
last
he
motioned
the
man
aside
and
stepped
*NL*
hurriedly
towards
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
Prince
Muishkin
?
''
he
asked
,
with
the
greatest
courtesy
and
*NL*
amiability
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
remarkably
handsome
young
fellow
of
some
twenty-eight
summers
,
*NL*
fair
and
of
middle
height
;
he
wore
a
small
beard
,
and
his
face
was
most
*NL*
intelligent
.
Yet
his
smile
,
in
spite
of
its
sweetness
,
was
a
little
*NL*
thin
,
if
I
may
so
call
it
,
and
showed
his
teeth
too
evenly
;
his
*NL*
gaze
though
decidedly
good-humoured
and
ingenuous
,
was
a
trifle
too
*NL*
inquisitive
and
intent
to
be
altogether
agreeable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Probably
when
he
is
alone
he
looks
quite
different
,
and
hardly
smiles
*NL*
at
all
!
''
thought
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
explained
about
himself
in
a
few
words
,
very
much
the
same
as
he
had
*NL*
told
the
footman
and
Rogojin
beforehand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gavrila
Ardalionovitch
meanwhile
seemed
to
be
trying
to
recall
*NL*
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
it
not
you
,
then
,
who
sent
a
letter
a
year
or
less
ago
--
from
*NL*
Switzerland
,
I
think
it
was
--
to
Elizabetha
Prokofievna
-LRB-
Mrs.
Epanchin
-RRB-
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
then
,
of
course
they
will
remember
who
you
are
.
You
wish
to
see
*NL*
the
general
?
I
'll
tell
him
at
once
--
he
will
be
free
in
a
minute
;
but
*NL*
you
--
you
had
better
wait
in
the
ante-chamber
,
--
had
n't
you
?
Why
is
he
*NL*
here
?
''
he
added
,
severely
,
to
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
,
sir
,
he
wished
it
himself
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
the
study
door
opened
,
and
a
military
man
,
with
a
*NL*
portfolio
under
his
arm
,
came
out
talking
loudly
,
and
after
bidding
*NL*
good-bye
to
someone
inside
,
took
his
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
there
,
Gania
?
''
cried
a
voice
from
the
study
,
``
come
in
here
,
will
*NL*
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gavrila
Ardalionovitch
nodded
to
the
prince
and
entered
the
room
*NL*
hastily
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
couple
of
minutes
later
the
door
opened
again
and
the
affable
voice
of
*NL*
Gania
cried
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
in
please
,
prince
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
III
.
*NL*
*NL*
General
Ivan
Fedorovitch
Epanchin
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
*NL*
room
,
and
gazed
with
great
curiosity
at
the
prince
as
he
entered
.
He
*NL*
even
advanced
a
couple
of
steps
to
meet
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
came
forward
and
introduced
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
so
,
''
replied
the
general
,
``
and
what
can
I
do
for
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
have
no
special
business
;
my
principal
object
was
to
make
your
*NL*
acquaintance
.
I
should
not
like
to
disturb
you
.
I
do
not
know
your
times
*NL*
and
arrangements
here
,
you
see
,
but
I
have
only
just
arrived
.
I
came
*NL*
straight
from
the
station
.
I
am
come
direct
from
Switzerland
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
general
very
nearly
smiled
,
but
thought
better
of
it
and
kept
his
*NL*
smile
back
.
Then
he
reflected
,
blinked
his
eyes
,
stared
at
his
guest
*NL*
once
more
from
head
to
foot
;
then
abruptly
motioned
him
to
a
chair
,
sat
*NL*
down
himself
,
and
waited
with
some
impatience
for
the
prince
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gania
stood
at
his
table
in
the
far
corner
of
the
room
,
turning
over
*NL*
papers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
much
time
for
making
acquaintances
,
as
a
rule
,
''
said
the
*NL*
general
,
``
but
as
,
of
course
,
you
have
your
object
in
coming
,
I
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
felt
sure
you
would
think
I
had
some
object
in
view
when
I
resolved
*NL*
to
pay
you
this
visit
,
''
the
prince
interrupted
;
``
but
I
give
you
my
word
,
*NL*
beyond
the
pleasure
of
making
your
acquaintance
I
had
no
personal
object
*NL*
whatever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
pleasure
is
,
of
course
,
mutual
;
but
life
is
not
all
pleasure
,
as
*NL*
you
are
aware
.
There
is
such
a
thing
as
business
,
and
I
really
do
not
*NL*
see
what
possible
reason
there
can
be
,
or
what
we
have
in
common
to
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
there
is
no
reason
,
of
course
,
and
I
suppose
there
is
nothing
in
*NL*
common
between
us
,
or
very
little
;
for
if
I
am
Prince
Muishkin
,
and
your
*NL*
wife
happens
to
be
a
member
of
my
house
,
that
can
hardly
be
called
a
*NL*
`
reason
.
'
I
quite
understand
that
.
And
yet
that
was
my
whole
motive
for
*NL*
coming
.
You
see
I
have
not
been
in
Russia
for
four
years
,
and
knew
very
*NL*
little
about
anything
when
I
left
.
I
had
been
very
ill
for
a
long
time
,
*NL*
and
I
feel
now
the
need
of
a
few
good
friends
.
In
fact
,
I
have
a
certain
*NL*
question
upon
which
I
much
need
advice
,
and
do
not
know
whom
to
go
to
*NL*
for
it
.
I
thought
of
your
family
when
I
was
passing
through
Berlin
.
*NL*
`
They
are
almost
relations
,
'
I
said
to
myself
,
'
so
I
'll
begin
with
them
;
*NL*
perhaps
we
may
get
on
with
each
other
,
I
with
them
and
they
with
me
,
if
*NL*
they
are
kind
people
;
'
and
I
have
heard
that
you
are
very
kind
people
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
thank
you
,
thank
you
,
I
'm
sure
,
''
replied
the
general
,
considerably
*NL*
taken
aback
.
``
May
I
ask
where
you
have
taken
up
your
quarters
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nowhere
,
as
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
straight
from
the
station
to
my
house
?
And
how
about
your
*NL*
luggage
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only
had
a
small
bundle
,
containing
linen
,
with
me
,
nothing
more
.
I
*NL*
can
carry
it
in
my
hand
,
easily
.
There
will
be
plenty
of
time
to
take
a
*NL*
room
in
some
hotel
by
the
evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
then
you
_
do
_
intend
to
take
a
room
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
judge
from
your
words
,
you
came
straight
to
my
house
with
the
*NL*
intention
of
staying
there

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
could
only
have
been
on
your
invitation

I
confess
,
however

that

I
should
not
have
stayed
here
even
if
you
had
invited
me
,
not
for
any
*NL*
particular
reason
,
but
because
it
is
--
well
,
contrary
to
my
practice
and
*NL*
nature
,
somehow
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
indeed

Then
it
is
perhaps
as
well
that
I
neither
_
did
_
invite
you
,
*NL*
nor
_
do
_
invite
you
now
.
Excuse
me
,
prince
,
but
we
had
better
make
this
*NL*
matter
clear
,
once
for
all
.
We
have
just
agreed
that
with
regard
to
our
*NL*
relationship
there
is
not
much
to
be
said
,
though
,
of
course
,
it
would
*NL*
have
been
very
delightful
to
us
to
feel
that
such
relationship
did
*NL*
actually
exist
;
therefore
,
perhaps
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Therefore
,
perhaps
I
had
better
get
up
and
go
away
?
''
said
the
prince
,
*NL*
laughing
merrily
as
he
rose
from
his
place
;
just
as
merrily
as
though
*NL*
the
circumstances
were
by
no
means
strained
or
difficult
.
``
And
I
give
*NL*
you
my
word
,
general
,
that
though
I
know
nothing
whatever
of
manners
and
*NL*
customs
of
society
,
and
how
people
live
and
all
that
,
yet
I
felt
quite
*NL*
sure
that
this
visit
of
mine
would
end
exactly
as
it
has
ended
now
.
*NL*
Oh
,
well
,
I
suppose
it
's
all
right
;
especially
as
my
letter
was
not
*NL*
answered
.
Well
,
good-bye
,
and
forgive
me
for
having
disturbed
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
's
expression
was
so
good-natured
at
this
moment
,
and
so
*NL*
entirely
free
from
even
a
suspicion
of
unpleasant
feeling
was
the
*NL*
smile
with
which
he
looked
at
the
general
as
he
spoke
,
that
the
latter
*NL*
suddenly
paused
,
and
appeared
to
gaze
at
his
guest
from
quite
a
new
*NL*
point
of
view
,
all
in
an
instant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
prince
,
''
he
said
,
in
quite
a
different
tone
,
``
I
do
not
*NL*
know
you
at
all
,
yet

and
after
all
,
Elizabetha
Prokofievna
would
*NL*
very
likely
be
pleased
to
have
a
peep
at
a
man
of
her
own
name
.
Wait
a
*NL*
little
,
if
you
do
n't
mind

if
you
have
time
to
spare

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

I
assure
you
I

lots

entirely
my

And
*NL*
the
prince
immediately
replaced
his
soft
,
round
hat
on
the
table
.
``
I
*NL*
confess
,
I
thought
Elizabetha
Prokofievna
would
very
likely
remember

that
I
had
written
her
a
letter
.
Just
now
your
servant
--
outside
*NL*
there
--
was
dreadfully
suspicious
that
I
had
come
to
beg
of
you

I
*NL*
noticed
that
!
Probably
he
has
very
strict
instructions
on
that
score
;
*NL*
but
I
assure
you
I
did
not
come
to
beg
.
I
came
to
make
some
friends
.
*NL*
But
I
am
rather
bothered
at
having
disturbed
you
;
that
's
all
I
care
*NL*
about
.

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
,
prince
,
''
said
the
general
,
with
a
cordial
smile
,
``
if
you
*NL*
really
are
the
sort
of
man
you
appear
to
be

it
may
be
a
source

you

off

Yes

As
to
disturbing
you
I
shall
soon

learn
to
avoid
doing
that

I
hate

Besides

you

are
so
differently

I

The
general
interrupted
once
more
with
questions
;
while
the
prince
again
*NL*
replied
with
the
narrative
we
have
heard
before
.
It
appeared
that
the
*NL*
general
had
known
Pavlicheff
;
but
why
the
latter
had
taken
an
interest
*NL*
in
the
prince
,
that
young
gentleman
could
not
explain
;
probably
by
*NL*
virtue
of
the
old
friendship
with
his
father
,
he
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
had
been
left
an
orphan
when
quite
a
little
child
,
and
*NL*
Pavlicheff
had
entrusted
him
to
an
old
lady
,
a
relative
of
his
own
,
*NL*
living
in
the
country
,
the
child
needing
the
fresh
air
and
exercise
of
*NL*
country
life
.
He
was
educated
,
first
by
a
governess
,
and
afterwards
by
a
*NL*
tutor
,
but
could
not
remember
much
about
this
time
of
his
life
.
His
fits
*NL*
were
so
frequent
then
,
that
they
made
almost
an
idiot
of
him
-LRB-
the
prince
*NL*
used
the
expression
``
idiot
''
himself
-RRB-
.
Pavlicheff
had
met
Professor
*NL*
Schneider
in
Berlin
,
and
the
latter
had
persuaded
him
to
send
the
boy
*NL*
to
Switzerland
,
to
Schneider
's
establishment
there
,
for
the
cure
of
his
*NL*
epilepsy
,
and
,
five
years
before
this
time
,
the
prince
was
sent
off
.
But
*NL*
Pavlicheff
had
died
two
or
three
years
since
,
and
Schneider
had
himself
*NL*
supported
the
young
fellow
,
from
that
day
to
this
,
at
his
own
expense
.
*NL*
Although
he
had
not
quite
cured
him
,
he
had
greatly
improved
his
*NL*
condition
;
and
now
,
at
last
,
at
the
prince
's
own
desire
,
and
because
*NL*
of
a
certain
matter
which
came
to
the
ears
of
the
latter
,
Schneider
had
*NL*
despatched
the
young
man
to
Russia
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
general
was
much
astonished
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
have
no
one
,
absolutely
_
no
_
one
in
Russia
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
one
,
at
present
;
but
I
hope
to
make
friends
;
and
then
I
have
a
*NL*
letter

*NL*
*NL*
``
At

put
in
the
general

not
listening
to
the
news
about
the
*NL*
letter
,
``
at
all
events

you
must
have
learned
_
something

your

not
prevent

some
easy
work

in
one
of
the
*NL*
departments

for

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

I
should
much

find
one

I
am
anxious
to
discover
what
I
really
am
fit

I
have
learned
*NL*
a
good
deal
in
the
last
four
years

I
read

excitement

the

the
general
continued
to
Gania
,
who
had
that
moment
taken
a
large
*NL*
photograph
out
of
his
portfolio
,
and
shown
it
to
his
senior
.
``
Halloa

with
much
curiosity

great
animation

*NL*
*NL*
``
She
gave

me
just
now

I
called
in

congratulate

I
asked

her
for
it
long

I
do
n't
know
whether
she
meant
it
for
a
hint
that
*NL*
I
had
come
empty-handed
,
without
a
present
for
her
birthday

or
what

*NL*
added
Gania
,
with
an
unpleasant
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
nonsense

nonsense

said
the
general
,
with
decision
.
``
What
*NL*
extraordinary
ideas
you
have
,
Gania
!
As
if
she
would
hint
;
that
's
*NL*
not
her
way
at
all

Besides
,
what
could
_
you
_
give
her
,
without
having
*NL*
thousands
at
your
disposal
?
You
might
have
given

Has
she

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

you
must

be

both

Ivanovitch
that

So
be

prepared

''
*NL*
*NL*
Gania
suddenly
became
so
ill
at
ease
that
his
face
grew
paler
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
sure
she
said
that
?

he
asked
,
and
his
voice
seemed
to
quiver
*NL*
as
he
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
she
promised

We
both
worried
her
so
that
she
gave
in

she

tell
you
nothing
about
it

*NL*
*NL*
The
general
watched
Gania
's
confusion
intently
,
and
clearly
did
not
like
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Remember

Ivan
Fedorovitch

said
Gania
,
in
great
agitation
,
``
that
I

was
to
be
free

decision

that
even
then
I

*NL*
my

*NL*
*NL*
``

``

said
the
general
with
annoyance

and
*NL*
apparently
not
in
the
least
anxious
to
conceal
it
.
``
Why
,
my
dear
*NL*
fellow

it
's
not
a
question
of
your
rejecting
her

is
whether
you
are
*NL*
prepared

receive
her
consent
joyfully

and
with
proper
satisfaction

How
are
things
going
on
at

*NL*
*NL*
``
At
home

Oh

can

I

only

rapidly

I
do

ever
talk

I
hold

I
should
have
shown

My

always
crying

sulks

I
intended
to

master

my
own
destiny

that
I
expect
to
be
obeyed

At

I
gave

present

``
Well

must
say

can
not

the

shrugging
*NL*
his
shoulders
and
dropping
his
hands

``
You
remember
your
mother

Nina

when
I

asked

what
was

says

What
next

have
warned

However

although
there

break

The
prince
heard
the
whole
of
the
foregoing
conversation
,
as
he
sat
at
*NL*
the
table
,
writing
.
He
finished
at
last
,
and
brought
the
result
of
his
*NL*
labour
to
the
general
's
desk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
this
is
Nastasia
Philipovna
,
''
he
said
,
looking
attentively
and
*NL*
curiously
at
the
portrait
.
``
How
wonderfully
beautiful
!
''
he
immediately
*NL*
added
,
with
warmth
.
The
picture
was
certainly
that
of
an
unusually
*NL*
lovely
woman
.
She
was
photographed
in
a
black
silk
dress
of
simple
*NL*
design
,
her
hair
was
evidently
dark
and
plainly
arranged
,
her
eyes
were
*NL*
deep
and
thoughtful
,
the
expression
of
her
face
passionate
,
but
proud
.
*NL*
She
was
rather
thin
,
perhaps
,
and
a
little
pale
.
Both
Gania
and
the
*NL*
general
gazed
at
the
prince
in
amazement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
know
it

Nastasia
Philipovna

asked
the

;
``
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

I
do

I
have
only
been
one
day
in
Russia

but
I
have
heard
of

the
great
beauty

And
the
prince
proceeded
to
narrate
his
meeting
with
*NL*
Rogojin
in
the
train
and
the
whole
of
the
latter
's
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There

said
the
general
in
some
excitement

after
listening
to
*NL*
the
story
with
engrossed
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

of

nothing

cried
Gania

a
little
*NL*
disturbed

however

``
It

*NL*
to
indulge
in
a
little
innocent
recreation
!
I
have
heard
something
of
*NL*
Rogojin
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
so
have
I
!
''
replied
the
general
.
``
Nastasia
Philipovna
told
us
*NL*
all
about
the
earrings
that
very
day
.
But
now
it
is
quite
a
different
*NL*
matter
.
You
see
the
fellow
really
has
a
million
of
roubles
,
and
he
is
*NL*
passionately
in
love
.
The
whole
story
smells
of
passion
,
and
we
all
*NL*
know
what
this
class
of
gentry
is
capable
of
when
infatuated
.
I
am
much
*NL*
afraid
of
some
disagreeable
scandal
,
I
am
indeed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
afraid
of
the
million
,
I
suppose
,
''
said
Gania
,
grinning
and
*NL*
showing
his
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
are
_
not
_
,
I
presume
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
did
he
strike
you
,
prince
?
''
asked
Gania
,
suddenly
.
``
Did
he
seem
to
*NL*
be
a
serious
sort
of
a
man
,
or
just
a
common
rowdy
fellow
?
What
was
your
*NL*
own
opinion
about
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
Gania
put
this
question
,
a
new
idea
suddenly
flashed
into
his
*NL*
brain
,
and
blazed
out
,
impatiently
,
in
his
eyes
.
The
general
,
who
was
*NL*
really
agitated
and
disturbed
,
looked
at
the
prince
too
,
but
did
not
*NL*
seem
to
expect
much
from
his
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
really
do
n't
quite
know
how
to
tell
you
,
''
replied
the
prince
,
``
but
*NL*
it
certainly
did
seem
to
me
that
the
man
was
full
of
passion
,
and
not
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
quite
healthy
passion
.
He
seemed
to
be
still
far
from
well
.
*NL*
Very
likely
he
will
be
in
bed
again
in
a
day
or
two
,
especially
if
he
*NL*
lives
fast
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
do
you
think
so
?
''
said
the
general
,
catching
at
the
idea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
do
think
so
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
the
sort
of
scandal
I
referred
to
may
happen
at
any
moment
.
It
*NL*
may
be
this
very
evening
,
''
remarked
Gania
to
the
general
,
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
;
quite
so
.
In
that
case
it
all
depends
upon
what
is
going
on
*NL*
in
her
brain
at
this
moment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
the
kind
of
person
she
is
at
times
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
?
What
kind
of
person
is
she
?
''
cried
the
general
,
arrived
at
the
*NL*
limits
of
his
patience
.
``
Look
here
,
Gania
,
do
n't
you
go
annoying
her
*NL*
tonight
.
What
you
are
to
do
is
to
be
as
agreeable
towards
her
as
ever
you
*NL*
can
.
Well
,
what
are
you
smiling
at
?
You
must
understand
,
Gania
,
that
*NL*
I
have
no
interest
whatever
in
speaking
like
this
.
Whichever
way
the
*NL*
question
is
settled
,
it
will
be
to
my
advantage
.
Nothing
will
move
*NL*
Totski
from
his
resolution
,
so
I
run
no
risk
.
If
there
is
anything
I
*NL*
desire
,
you
must
know
that
it
is
your
benefit
only
.
Ca
n't
you
trust
me
?
*NL*
You
are
a
sensible
fellow
,
and
I
have
been
counting
on
you
;
for
,
in
this
*NL*
matter
,
that
,
that
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
's
the
chief
thing
,
''
said
Gania
,
helping
the
general
out
of
*NL*
his
difficulties
again
,
and
curling
his
lips
in
an
envenomed
smile
,
*NL*
which
he
did
not
attempt
to
conceal
.
He
gazed
with
his
fevered
eyes
*NL*
straight
into
those
of
the
general
,
as
though
he
were
anxious
that
the
*NL*
latter
might
read
his
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
general
grew
purple
with
anger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
of
course
it
is
the
chief
thing
!
''
he
cried
,
looking
sharply
at
*NL*
Gania
.
``
What
a
very
curious
man
you
are
,
Gania
!
You
actually
seem
to
*NL*
be
_
glad
_
to
hear
of
this
millionaire
fellow
's
arrival
--
just
as
though
you
*NL*
wished
for
an
excuse
to
get
out
of
the
whole
thing
.
This
is
an
affair
in
*NL*
which
you
ought
to
act
honestly
with
both
sides
,
and
give
due
warning
,
*NL*
to
avoid
compromising
others
.
But
,
even
now
,
there
is
still
time
.
Do
*NL*
you
understand
me
?
I
wish
to
know
whether
you
desire
this
arrangement
or
*NL*
whether
you
do
not
?
If
not
,
say
so
,
--
and
--
and
welcome
!
No
one
is
trying
*NL*
to
force
you
into
the
snare
,
Gavrila
Ardalionovitch
,
if
you
see
a
snare
*NL*
in
the
matter
,
at
least
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
desire
it
,
''
murmured
Gania
,
softly
but
firmly
,
lowering
his
eyes
;
*NL*
and
he
relapsed
into
gloomy
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
general
was
satisfied
.
He
had
excited
himself
,
and
was
evidently
*NL*
now
regretting
that
he
had
gone
so
far
.
He
turned
to
the
prince
,
and
*NL*
suddenly
the
disagreeable
thought
of
the
latter
's
presence
struck
*NL*
him
,
and
the
certainty
that
he
must
have
heard
every
word
of
the
*NL*
conversation
.
But
he
felt
at
ease
in
another
moment
;
it
only
needed
one
*NL*
glance
at
the
prince
to
see
that
in
that
quarter
there
was
nothing
to
*NL*
fear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
cried
the
general
,
catching
sight
of
the
prince
's
specimen
of
*NL*
caligraphy
,
which
the
latter
had
now
handed
him
for
inspection
.
``
Why
,
*NL*
this
is
simply
beautiful
;
look
at
that
,
Gania
,
there
's
real
talent
*NL*
there
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
a
sheet
of
thick
writing-paper
the
prince
had
written
in
medieval
*NL*
characters
the
legend
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
gentle
Abbot
Pafnute
signed
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
''
explained
the
prince
,
with
great
delight
and
animation
,
``
there
,
*NL*
that
's
the
abbot
's
real
signature
--
from
a
manuscript
of
the
fourteenth
*NL*
century
.
All
these
old
abbots
and
bishops
used
to
write
most
*NL*
beautifully
,
with
such
taste
and
so
much
care
and
diligence
.
Have
you
no
*NL*
copy
of
Pogodin
,
general
?
If
you
had
one
I
could
show
you
another
type
.
*NL*
Stop
a
bit
--
here
you
have
the
large
round
writing
common
in
France
*NL*
during
the
eighteenth
century
.
Some
of
the
letters
are
shaped
quite
*NL*
differently
from
those
now
in
use
.
It
was
the
writing
current
then
,
and
*NL*
employed
by
public
writers
generally
.
I
copied
this
from
one
of
them
,
*NL*
and
you
can
see
how
good
it
is
.
Look
at
the
well-rounded
a
and
d.
I
*NL*
have
tried
to
translate
the
French
character
into
the
Russian
letters
--
a
*NL*
difficult
thing
to
do
,
but
I
think
I
have
succeeded
fairly
.
Here
is
a
*NL*
fine
sentence
,
written
in
a
good
,
original
hand
--
`
Zeal
triumphs
over
*NL*
all
.
'
That
is
the
script
of
the
Russian
War
Office
.
That
is
how
official
*NL*
documents
addressed
to
important
personages
should
be
written
.
The
*NL*
letters
are
round
,
the
type
black
,
and
the
style
somewhat
remarkable
.
A
*NL*
stylist
would
not
allow
these
ornaments
,
or
attempts
at
flourishes
--
just
*NL*
look
at
these
unfinished
tails
!
--
but
it
has
distinction
and
really
*NL*
depicts
the
soul
of
the
writer
.
He
would
like
to
give
play
to
his
*NL*
imagination
,
and
follow
the
inspiration
of
his
genius
,
but
a
soldier
is
*NL*
only
at
ease
in
the
guard-room
,
and
the
pen
stops
half-way
,
a
slave
*NL*
to
discipline
.
How
delightful
!
The
first
time
I
met
an
example
of
this
*NL*
handwriting
,
I
was
positively
astonished
,
and
where
do
you
think
I
*NL*
chanced
to
find
it
?
In
Switzerland
,
of
all
places
!
Now
that
is
an
*NL*
ordinary
English
hand
.
It
can
hardly
be
improved
,
it
is
so
refined
and
*NL*
exquisite
--
almost
perfection
.
This
is
an
example
of
another
kind
,
*NL*
a
mixture
of
styles
.
The
copy
was
given
me
by
a
French
commercial
*NL*
traveller
.
It
is
founded
on
the
English
,
but
the
downstrokes
are
a
*NL*
little
blacker
,
and
more
marked
.
Notice
that
the
oval
has
some
slight
*NL*
modification
--
it
is
more
rounded
.
This
writing
allows
for
flourishes
;
*NL*
now
a
flourish
is
a
dangerous
thing
!
Its
use
requires
such
taste
,
but
,
*NL*
if
successful
,
what
a
distinction
it
gives
to
the
whole
!
It
results
in
*NL*
an
incomparable
type
--
one
to
fall
in
love
with
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
me
!
How
you
have
gone
into
all
the
refinements
and
details
of
the
*NL*
question
!
Why
,
my
dear
fellow
,
you
are
not
a
caligraphist
,
you
are
an
*NL*
artist
!
Eh
,
Gania
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wonderful
!
''
said
Gania
.
``
And
he
knows
it
too
,
''
he
added
,
with
a
*NL*
sarcastic
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
smile
,
--
but
there
's
a
career
in
this
,
''
said
the
general
.
``
You
*NL*
do
n't
know
what
a
great
personage
I
shall
show
this
to
,
prince
.
Why
,
you
*NL*
can
command
a
situation
at
thirty-five
roubles
per
month
to
start
with
.
*NL*
However
,
it
's
half-past
twelve
,
''
he
concluded
,
looking
at
his
watch
;
``
so
*NL*
to
business
,
prince
,
for
I
must
be
setting
to
work
and
shall
not
see
you
*NL*
again
today
.
Sit
down
a
minute
.
I
have
told
you
that
I
can
not
receive
*NL*
you
myself
very
often
,
but
I
should
like
to
be
of
some
assistance
to
*NL*
you
,
some
small
assistance
,
of
a
kind
that
would
give
you
satisfaction
.
*NL*
I
shall
find
you
a
place
in
one
of
the
State
departments
,
an
easy
*NL*
place
--
but
you
will
require
to
be
accurate
.
Now
,
as
to
your
plans
--
in
*NL*
the
house
,
or
rather
in
the
family
of
Gania
here
--
my
young
friend
,
whom
*NL*
I
hope
you
will
know
better
--
his
mother
and
sister
have
prepared
two
*NL*
or
three
rooms
for
lodgers
,
and
let
them
to
highly
recommended
young
*NL*
fellows
,
with
board
and
attendance
.
I
am
sure
Nina
Alexandrovna
will
*NL*
take
you
in
on
my
recommendation
.
There
you
will
be
comfortable
and
well
*NL*
taken
care
of
;
for
I
do
not
think
,
prince
,
that
you
are
the
sort
of
*NL*
man
to
be
left
to
the
mercy
of
Fate
in
a
town
like
Petersburg
.
Nina
*NL*
Alexandrovna
,
Gania
's
mother
,
and
Varvara
Alexandrovna
,
are
ladies
for
*NL*
whom
I
have
the
highest
possible
esteem
and
respect
.
Nina
Alexandrovna
*NL*
is
the
wife
of
General
Ardalion
Alexandrovitch
,
my
old
brother
in
arms
,
*NL*
with
whom
,
I
regret
to
say
,
on
account
of
certain
circumstances
,
I
am
no
*NL*
longer
acquainted
.
I
give
you
all
this
information
,
prince
,
in
order
*NL*
to
make
it
clear
to
you
that
I
am
personally
recommending
you
to
this
*NL*
family
,
and
that
in
so
doing
,
I
am
more
or
less
taking
upon
myself
to
*NL*
answer
for
you
.
The
terms
are
most
reasonable
,
and
I
trust
that
your
*NL*
salary
will
very
shortly
prove
amply
sufficient
for
your
expenditure
.
Of
*NL*
course
pocket-money
is
a
necessity
,
if
only
a
little
;
do
not
be
angry
,
*NL*
prince
,
if
I
strongly
recommend
you
to
avoid
carrying
money
in
your
*NL*
pocket
.
But
as
your
purse
is
quite
empty
at
the
present
moment
,
you
must
*NL*
allow
me
to
press
these
twenty-five
roubles
upon
your
acceptance
,
as
*NL*
something
to
begin
with
.
Of
course
we
will
settle
this
little
matter
*NL*
another
time
,
and
if
you
are
the
upright
,
honest
man
you
look
,
I
*NL*
anticipate
very
little
trouble
between
us
on
that
score
.
Taking
so
much
*NL*
interest
in
you
as
you
may
perceive
I
do
,
I
am
not
without
my
object
,
*NL*
and
you
shall
know
it
in
good
time
.
You
see
,
I
am
perfectly
candid
with
*NL*
you
.
I
hope
,
Gania
,
you
have
nothing
to
say
against
the
prince
's
taking
*NL*
up
his
abode
in
your
house
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
on
the
contrary
!
my
mother
will
be
very
glad

said
Gania
,
*NL*
courteously
and
kindly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
only
one
of
your
rooms

engaged

it
not

says

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

``

*NL*
*NL*
``

behaved
very

out

I
*NL*
certainly
did
not

where
to
lay
my
head
tonight

Rogojin
asked

of
course

*NL*
``

the

the

n't
another
moment
now

I
shall
just
tell
Elizabetha
Prokofievna
*NL*
about
you
,
and
if
she
wishes
to
receive
you
at
once
--
as
I
shall
advise
*NL*
her
--
I
strongly
recommend
you
to
ingratiate
yourself
with
her
at
the
*NL*
first
opportunity
,
for
my
wife
may
be
of
the
greatest
service
to
you
in
*NL*
many
ways
.
If
she
can
not
receive
you
now
,
you
must
be
content
to
wait
*NL*
till
another
time
.
Meanwhile
you
,
Gania
,
just
look
over
these
accounts
,
*NL*
will
you
?
We
must
n't
forget
to
finish
off
that
matter

The
general
left
the
room
,
and
the
prince
never
succeeded
in
broaching
*NL*
the
business
which
he
had
on
hand
,
though
he
had
endeavoured
to
do
so
*NL*
four
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gania
lit
a
cigarette
and
offered
one
to
the
prince
.
The
latter
accepted
*NL*
the
offer
,
but
did
not
talk
,
being
unwilling
to
disturb
Gania
's
work
.
*NL*
He
commenced
to
examine
the
study
and
its
contents
.
But
Gania
hardly
*NL*
so
much
as
glanced
at
the
papers
lying
before
him
;
he
was
absent
and
*NL*
thoughtful
,
and
his
smile
and
general
appearance
struck
the
prince
still
*NL*
more
disagreeably
now
that
the
two
were
left
alone
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
Gania
approached
our
hero
who
was
at
the
moment
standing
over
*NL*
Nastasia
Philipovna
's
portrait
,
gazing
at
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
admire
that
sort
of
woman
,
prince
?
''
he
asked
,
looking
intently
*NL*
at
him
.
He
seemed
to
have
some
special
object
in
the
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
wonderful
face
,
''
said
the
prince
,
``
and
I
feel
sure
that
her
*NL*
destiny
is
not
by
any
means
an
ordinary
,
uneventful
one
.
Her
face
is
*NL*
smiling
enough
,
but
she
must
have
suffered
terribly
--
has
n't
she
?
Her
*NL*
eyes
show
it
--
those
two
bones
there
,
the
little
points
under
her
eyes
,
*NL*
just
where
the
cheek
begins
.
It
's
a
proud
face
too
,
terribly
proud
!
And
*NL*
I
--
I
ca
n't
say
whether
she
is
good
and
kind
,
or
not
.
Oh
,
if
she
be
but
*NL*
good
!
That
would
make
all
well
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
would
you
marry
a
woman
like
that
,
now
?
''
continued
Gania
,
never
*NL*
taking
his
excited
eyes
off
the
prince
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
marry
at
all
,
''
said
the
latter
.
``
I
am
an
invalid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
Rogojin
marry
her
,
do
you
think
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
Certainly
he
would
,
I
should
think
.
He
would
marry
her
*NL*
tomorrow
!
--
marry
her
tomorrow
and
murder
her
in
a
week
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hardly
had
the
prince
uttered
the
last
word
when
Gania
gave
such
a
*NL*
fearful
shudder
that
the
prince
almost
cried
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
?
''
said
he
,
seizing
Gania
's
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
highness
!
His
excellency
begs
your
presence
in
her
excellency
's
*NL*
apartments
!
''
announced
the
footman
,
appearing
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
immediately
followed
the
man
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
IV
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
three
of
the
Miss
Epanchins
were
fine
,
healthy
girls
,
well-grown
,
*NL*
with
good
shoulders
and
busts
,
and
strong
--
almost
masculine
--
hands
;
*NL*
and
,
of
course
,
with
all
the
above
attributes
,
they
enjoyed
capital
*NL*
appetites
,
of
which
they
were
not
in
the
least
ashamed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabetha
Prokofievna
sometimes
informed
the
girls
that
they
were
*NL*
a
little
too
candid
in
this
matter
,
but
in
spite
of
their
outward
*NL*
deference
to
their
mother
these
three
young
women
,
in
solemn
conclave
,
*NL*
had
long
agreed
to
modify
the
unquestioning
obedience
which
they
had
*NL*
been
in
the
habit
of
according
to
her
;
and
Mrs.
General
Epanchin
had
*NL*
judged
it
better
to
say
nothing
about
it
,
though
,
of
course
,
she
was
*NL*
well
aware
of
the
fact
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
true
that
her
nature
sometimes
rebelled
against
these
dictates
*NL*
of
reason
,
and
that
she
grew
yearly
more
capricious
and
impatient
;
but
*NL*
having
a
respectful
and
well-disciplined
husband
under
her
thumb
at
*NL*
all
times
,
she
found
it
possible
,
as
a
rule
,
to
empty
any
little
*NL*
accumulations
of
spleen
upon
his
head
,
and
therefore
the
harmony
of
the
*NL*
family
was
kept
duly
balanced
,
and
things
went
as
smoothly
as
family
*NL*
matters
can
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Epanchin
had
a
fair
appetite
herself
,
and
generally
took
her
share
*NL*
of
the
capital
mid-day
lunch
which
was
always
served
for
the
girls
,
and
*NL*
which
was
nearly
as
good
as
a
dinner
.
The
young
ladies
used
to
have
a
*NL*
cup
of
coffee
each
before
this
meal
,
at
ten
o'clock
,
while
still
in
bed
.
*NL*
This
was
a
favourite
and
unalterable
arrangement
with
them
.
At
half-past
*NL*
twelve
,
the
table
was
laid
in
the
small
dining-room
,
and
occasionally
*NL*
the
general
himself
appeared
at
the
family
gathering
,
if
he
had
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
tea
and
coffee
,
cheese
,
honey
,
butter
,
pan-cakes
of
various
*NL*
kinds
-LRB-
the
lady
of
the
house
loved
these
best
-RRB-
,
cutlets
,
and
so
on
,
*NL*
there
was
generally
strong
beef
soup
,
and
other
substantial
delicacies
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
particular
morning
on
which
our
story
has
opened
,
the
family
had
*NL*
assembled
in
the
dining-room
,
and
were
waiting
the
general
's
appearance
,
*NL*
the
latter
having
promised
to
come
this
day
.
If
he
had
been
one
moment
*NL*
late
,
he
would
have
been
sent
for
at
once
;
but
he
turned
up
punctually
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
came
forward
to
wish
his
wife
good-morning
and
kiss
her
hands
,
as
*NL*
his
custom
was
,
he
observed
something
in
her
look
which
boded
ill
.
He
*NL*
thought
he
knew
the
reason
,
and
had
expected
it
,
but
still
,
he
was
not
*NL*
altogether
comfortable
.
His
daughters
advanced
to
kiss
him
,
too
,
and
*NL*
though
they
did
not
look
exactly
angry
,
there
was
something
strange
in
*NL*
their
expression
as
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
general
was
,
owing
to
certain
circumstances
,
a
little
inclined
to
be
*NL*
too
suspicious
at
home
,
and
needlessly
nervous
;
but
,
as
an
experienced
*NL*
father
and
husband
,
he
judged
it
better
to
take
measures
at
once
to
*NL*
protect
himself
from
any
dangers
there
might
be
in
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
I
hope
I
shall
not
interfere
with
the
proper
sequence
of
my
*NL*
narrative
too
much
,
if
I
diverge
for
a
moment
at
this
point
,
in
order
*NL*
to
explain
the
mutual
relations
between
General
Epanchin
's
family
and
*NL*
others
acting
a
part
in
this
history
,
at
the
time
when
we
take
up
the
*NL*
thread
of
their
destiny
.
I
have
already
stated
that
the
general
,
though
*NL*
he
was
a
man
of
lowly
origin
,
and
of
poor
education
,
was
,
for
all
that
,
*NL*
an
experienced
and
talented
husband
and
father
.
Among
other
things
,
*NL*
he
considered
it
undesirable
to
hurry
his
daughters
to
the
matrimonial
*NL*
altar
and
to
worry
them
too
much
with
assurances
of
his
paternal
wishes
*NL*
for
their
happiness
,
as
is
the
custom
among
parents
of
many
grown-up
*NL*
daughters
.
He
even
succeeded
in
ranging
his
wife
on
his
side
on
this
*NL*
question
,
though
he
found
the
feat
very
difficult
to
accomplish
,
because
*NL*
unnatural
;
but
the
general
's
arguments
were
conclusive
,
and
founded
upon
*NL*
obvious
facts
.
The
general
considered
that
the
girls
'
taste
and
good
*NL*
sense
should
be
allowed
to
develop
and
mature
deliberately
,
and
that
the
*NL*
parents
'
duty
should
merely
be
to
keep
watch
,
in
order
that
no
strange
*NL*
or
undesirable
choice
be
made
;
but
that
the
selection
once
effected
,
*NL*
both
father
and
mother
were
bound
from
that
moment
to
enter
heart
and
*NL*
soul
into
the
cause
,
and
to
see
that
the
matter
progressed
without
*NL*
hindrance
until
the
altar
should
be
happily
reached
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
this
,
it
was
clear
that
the
Epanchins
'
position
gained
each
*NL*
year
,
with
geometrical
accuracy
,
both
as
to
financial
solidity
and
*NL*
social
weight
;
and
,
therefore
,
the
longer
the
girls
waited
,
the
better
*NL*
was
their
chance
of
making
a
brilliant
match
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
again
,
amidst
the
incontrovertible
facts
just
recorded
,
one
more
,
*NL*
equally
significant
,
rose
up
to
confront
the
family
;
and
this
was
,
*NL*
that
the
eldest
daughter
,
Alexandra
,
had
imperceptibly
arrived
at
her
*NL*
twenty-fifth
birthday
.
Almost
at
the
same
moment
,
Afanasy
Ivanovitch
*NL*
Totski
,
a
man
of
immense
wealth
,
high
connections
,
and
good
standing
,
*NL*
announced
his
intention
of
marrying
.
Afanasy
Ivanovitch
was
a
gentleman
*NL*
of
fifty-five
years
of
age
,
artistically
gifted
,
and
of
most
refined
*NL*
tastes
.
He
wished
to
marry
well
,
and
,
moreover
,
he
was
a
keen
admirer
*NL*
and
judge
of
beauty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
since
Totski
had
,
of
late
,
been
upon
terms
of
great
cordiality
with
*NL*
Epanchin
,
which
excellent
relations
were
intensified
by
the
fact
that
*NL*
they
were
,
so
to
speak
,
partners
in
several
financial
enterprises
,
it
*NL*
so
happened
that
the
former
now
put
in
a
friendly
request
to
the
general
*NL*
for
counsel
with
regard
to
the
important
step
he
meditated
.
Might
he
*NL*
suggest
,
for
instance
,
such
a
thing
as
a
marriage
between
himself
and
*NL*
one
of
the
general
's
daughters
?
*NL*
*NL*
Evidently
the
quiet
,
pleasant
current
of
the
family
life
of
the
*NL*
Epanchins
was
about
to
undergo
a
change
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
undoubted
beauty
of
the
family
,
_
par
excellence
_
,
was
the
youngest
,
*NL*
Aglaya
,
as
aforesaid
.
But
Totski
himself
,
though
an
egotist
of
the
*NL*
extremest
type
,
realized
that
he
had
no
chance
there
;
Aglaya
was
clearly
*NL*
not
for
such
as
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
the
sisterly
love
and
friendship
of
the
three
girls
had
more
or
*NL*
less
exaggerated
Aglaya
's
chances
of
happiness
.
In
their
opinion
,
the
*NL*
latter
's
destiny
was
not
merely
to
be
very
happy
;
she
was
to
live
in
*NL*
a
heaven
on
earth
.
Aglaya
's
husband
was
to
be
a
compendium
of
all
the
*NL*
virtues
,
and
of
all
success
,
not
to
speak
of
fabulous
wealth
.
The
two
*NL*
elder
sisters
had
agreed
that
all
was
to
be
sacrificed
by
them
,
if
need
*NL*
be
,
for
Aglaya
's
sake
;
her
dowry
was
to
be
colossal
and
unprecedented
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
general
and
his
wife
were
aware
of
this
agreement
,
and
,
therefore
,
*NL*
when
Totski
suggested
himself
for
one
of
the
sisters
,
the
parents
made
*NL*
no
doubt
that
one
of
the
two
elder
girls
would
probably
accept
the
*NL*
offer
,
since
Totski
would
certainly
make
no
difficulty
as
to
dowry
.
The
*NL*
general
valued
the
proposal
very
highly
.
He
knew
life
,
and
realized
what
*NL*
such
an
offer
was
worth
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
answer
of
the
sisters
to
the
communication
was
,
if
not
conclusive
,
*NL*
at
least
consoling
and
hopeful
.
It
made
known
that
the
eldest
,
*NL*
Alexandra
,
would
very
likely
be
disposed
to
listen
to
a
proposal
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
was
a
good-natured
girl
,
though
she
had
a
will
of
her
own
.
She
*NL*
was
intelligent
and
kind-hearted
,
and
,
if
she
were
to
marry
Totski
,
she
*NL*
would
make
him
a
good
wife
.
She
did
not
care
for
a
brilliant
marriage
;
*NL*
she
was
eminently
a
woman
calculated
to
soothe
and
sweeten
the
life
of
*NL*
any
man
;
decidedly
pretty
,
if
not
absolutely
handsome
.
What
better
could
*NL*
Totski
wish
?
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
matter
crept
slowly
forward
.
The
general
and
Totski
had
agreed
to
*NL*
avoid
any
hasty
and
irrevocable
step
.
Alexandra
's
parents
had
not
even
*NL*
begun
to
talk
to
their
daughters
freely
upon
the
subject
,
when
suddenly
,
*NL*
as
it
were
,
a
dissonant
chord
was
struck
amid
the
harmony
of
the
*NL*
proceedings
.
Mrs.
Epanchin
began
to
show
signs
of
discontent
,
and
*NL*
that
was
a
serious
matter
.
A
certain
circumstance
had
crept
in
,
a
*NL*
disagreeable
and
troublesome
factor
,
which
threatened
to
overturn
the
*NL*
whole
business
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
circumstance
had
come
into
existence
eighteen
years
before
.
Close
*NL*
to
an
estate
of
Totski
's
,
in
one
of
the
central
provinces
of
Russia
,
*NL*
there
lived
,
at
that
time
,
a
poor
gentleman
whose
estate
was
of
the
*NL*
wretchedest
description
.
This
gentleman
was
noted
in
the
district
for
*NL*
his
persistent
ill-fortune
;
his
name
was
Barashkoff
,
and
,
as
regards
*NL*
family
and
descent
,
he
was
vastly
superior
to
Totski
,
but
his
estate
was
*NL*
mortgaged
to
the
last
acre
.
One
day
,
when
he
had
ridden
over
to
the
town
*NL*
to
see
a
creditor
,
the
chief
peasant
of
his
village
followed
him
shortly
*NL*
after
,
with
the
news
that
his
house
had
been
burnt
down
,
and
that
his
*NL*
wife
had
perished
with
it
,
but
his
children
were
safe
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
Barashkoff
,
inured
to
the
storms
of
evil
fortune
as
he
was
,
could
*NL*
not
stand
this
last
stroke
.
He
went
mad
and
died
shortly
after
in
the
*NL*
town
hospital
.
His
estate
was
sold
for
the
creditors
;
and
the
little
*NL*
girls
--
two
of
them
,
of
seven
and
eight
years
of
age
respectively
,
--
were
*NL*
adopted
by
Totski
,
who
undertook
their
maintenance
and
education
in
the
*NL*
kindness
of
his
heart
.
They
were
brought
up
together
with
the
children
*NL*
of
his
German
bailiff
.
Very
soon
,
however
,
there
was
only
one
of
*NL*
them
left

Philipovna
--
for
the
other
little
one
died
of
*NL*
whooping-cough
.
Totski
,
who
was
living
abroad
at
this
time
,
very
soon
*NL*
forgot
all
about
the
child
;
but
five
years
after
,
returning
to
Russia
,
*NL*
it
struck
him
that
he
would
like
to
look
over
his
estate
and
see
how
*NL*
matters
were
going
there
,
and
,
arrived
at
his
bailiff
's
house
,
he
was
*NL*
not
long
in
discovering
that
among
the
children
of
the
latter
there
now
*NL*
dwelt
a
most
lovely
little
girl
of
twelve
,
sweet
and
intelligent
,
and
*NL*
bright
,
and
promising
to
develop
beauty
of
most
unusual
quality-as
to
*NL*
which
last
Totski
was
an
undoubted
authority
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
only
stayed
at
his
country
seat
a
few
days
on
this
occasion
,
but
*NL*
he
had
time
to
make
his
arrangements
.
Great
changes
took
place
in
*NL*
the
child
's
education
;
a
good
governess
was
engaged
,
a
Swiss
lady
of
*NL*
experience
and
culture
.
For
four
years
this
lady
resided
in
the
house
*NL*
with
little
Nastia
,
and
then
the
education
was
considered
complete
.
*NL*
The
governess
took
her
departure
,
and
another
lady
came
down
to
fetch
*NL*
Nastia
,
by
Totski
's
instructions
.
The
child
was
now
transported
to
*NL*
another
of
Totski
's
estates
in
a
distant
part
of
the
country
.
Here
*NL*
she
found
a
delightful
little
house
,
just
built
,
and
prepared
for
her
*NL*
reception
with
great
care
and
taste
;
and
here
she
took
up
her
abode
*NL*
together
with
the
lady
who
had
accompanied
her
from
her
old
home
.
In
*NL*
the
house
there
were
two
experienced
maids
,
musical
instruments
of
*NL*
all
sorts
,
a
charming
``
young
lady
's
library
,
''
pictures
,
paint-boxes
,
*NL*
a
lap-dog
,
and
everything
to
make
life
agreeable
.
Within
a
fortnight
*NL*
Totski
himself
arrived
,
and
from
that
time
he
appeared
to
have
taken
a
*NL*
great
fancy
to
this
part
of
the
world
and
came
down
each
summer
,
staying
*NL*
two
and
three
months
at
a
time
.
So
passed
four
years
peacefully
and
*NL*
happily
,
in
charming
surroundings
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
end
of
that
time
,
and
about
four
months
after
Totski
's
last
*NL*
visit
-LRB-
he
had
stayed
but
a
fortnight
on
this
occasion
-RRB-
,
a
report
reached
*NL*
Nastasia
Philipovna
that
he
was
about
to
be
married
in
St.
Petersburg
,
*NL*
to
a
rich
,
eminent
,
and
lovely
woman
.
The
report
was
only
partially
*NL*
true
,
the
marriage
project
being
only
in
an
embryo
condition
;
but
a
*NL*
great
change
now
came
over
Nastasia
Philipovna
.
She
suddenly
displayed
*NL*
unusual
decision
of
character
;
and
without
wasting
time
in
thought
,
*NL*
she
left
her
country
home
and
came
up
to
St.
Petersburg
,
straight
to
*NL*
Totski
's
house
,
all
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
,
amazed
at
her
conduct
,
began
to
express
his
displeasure
;
*NL*
but
he
very
soon
became
aware
that
he
must
change
his
voice
,
style
,
and
*NL*
everything
else
,
with
this
young
lady
;
the
good
old
times
were
gone
.
An
*NL*
entirely
new
and
different
woman
sat
before
him
,
between
whom
and
*NL*
the
girl
he
had
left
in
the
country
last
July
there
seemed
nothing
in
*NL*
common
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
first
place
,
this
new
woman
understood
a
good
deal
more
than
was
*NL*
usual
for
young
people
of
her
age
;
so
much
indeed
,
that
Totski
could
not
*NL*
help
wondering
where
she
had
picked
up
her
knowledge
.
Surely
not
from
*NL*
her
``
young
lady
's
library
''
?
It
even
embraced
legal
matters
,
and
the
*NL*
``
world
''
in
general
,
to
a
considerable
extent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
character
was
absolutely
changed
.
No
more
of
the
girlish
*NL*
alternations
of
timidity
and
petulance
,
the
adorable
naivete
,
the
*NL*
reveries
,
the
tears
,
the
playfulness
...
It
was
an
entirely
new
and
*NL*
hitherto
unknown
being
who
now
sat
and
laughed
at
him
,
and
informed
him
*NL*
to
his
face
that
she
had
never
had
the
faintest
feeling
for
him
of
any
*NL*
kind
,
except
loathing
and
contempt
--
contempt
which
had
followed
closely
*NL*
upon
her
sensations
of
surprise
and
bewilderment
after
her
first
*NL*
acquaintance
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
new
woman
gave
him
further
to
understand
that
though
it
was
*NL*
absolutely
the
same
to
her
whom
he
married
,
yet
she
had
decided
to
*NL*
prevent
this
marriage
--
for
no
particular
reason
,
but
that
she
_
chose
_
to
*NL*
do
so
,
and
because
she
wished
to
amuse
herself
at
his
expense
for
that
*NL*
it
was
``
quite
her
turn
to
laugh
a
little
now
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Such
were
her
words
--
very
likely
she
did
not
give
her
real
reason
for
*NL*
this
eccentric
conduct
;
but
,
at
all
events
,
that
was
all
the
explanation
*NL*
she
deigned
to
offer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
Totski
thought
the
matter
over
as
well
as
his
scattered
ideas
*NL*
would
permit
.
His
meditations
lasted
a
fortnight
,
however
,
and
at
the
*NL*
end
of
that
time
his
resolution
was
taken
.
The
fact
was
,
Totski
was
*NL*
at
that
time
a
man
of
fifty
years
of
age
;
his
position
was
solid
and
*NL*
respectable
;
his
place
in
society
had
long
been
firmly
fixed
upon
safe
*NL*
foundations
;
he
loved
himself
,
his
personal
comforts
,
and
his
position
*NL*
better
than
all
the
world
,
as
every
respectable
gentleman
should
!
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
time
his
grasp
of
things
in
general
soon
showed
Totski
that
*NL*
he
now
had
to
deal
with
a
being
who
was
outside
the
pale
of
the
ordinary
*NL*
rules
of
traditional
behaviour
,
and
who
would
not
only
threaten
mischief
*NL*
but
would
undoubtedly
carry
it
out
,
and
stop
for
no
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
evidently
,
he
concluded
,
something
at
work
here
;
some
storm
of
*NL*
the
mind
,
some
paroxysm
of
romantic
anger
,
goodness
knows
against
whom
*NL*
or
what
,
some
insatiable
contempt
--
in
a
word
,
something
altogether
*NL*
absurd
and
impossible
,
but
at
the
same
time
most
dangerous
to
be
met
*NL*
with
by
any
respectable
person
with
a
position
in
society
to
keep
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
man
of
Totski
's
wealth
and
standing
,
it
would
,
of
course
,
have
*NL*
been
the
simplest
possible
matter
to
take
steps
which
would
rid
him
at
*NL*
once
from
all
annoyance
;
while
it
was
obviously
impossible
for
Nastasia
*NL*
Philipovna
to
harm
him
in
any
way
,
either
legally
or
by
stirring
up
a
*NL*
scandal
,
for
,
in
case
of
the
latter
danger
,
he
could
so
easily
remove
*NL*
her
to
a
sphere
of
safety
.
However
,
these
arguments
would
only
hold
good
*NL*
in
case
of
Nastasia
acting
as
others
might
in
such
an
emergency
.
She
was
*NL*
much
more
likely
to
overstep
the
bounds
of
reasonable
conduct
by
some
*NL*
extraordinary
eccentricity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
sound
judgment
of
Totski
stood
him
in
good
stead
.
He
realized
*NL*
that
Nastasia
Philipovna
must
be
well
aware
that
she
could
do
nothing
*NL*
by
legal
means
to
injure
him
,
and
that
her
flashing
eyes
betrayed
some
*NL*
entirely
different
intention
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nastasia
Philipovna
was
quite
capable
of
ruining
herself
,
and
even
of
*NL*
perpetrating
something
which
would
send
her
to
Siberia
,
for
the
mere
*NL*
pleasure
of
injuring
a
man
for
whom
she
had
developed
so
inhuman
a
sense
*NL*
of
loathing
and
contempt
.
He
had
sufficient
insight
to
understand
that
*NL*
she
valued
nothing
in
the
world
--
herself
least
of
all
--
and
he
made
no
*NL*
attempt
to
conceal
the
fact
that
he
was
a
coward
in
some
respects
.
For
*NL*
instance
,
if
he
had
been
told
that
he
would
be
stabbed
at
the
altar
,
or
*NL*
publicly
insulted
,
he
would
undoubtedly
have
been
frightened
;
but
not
so
*NL*
much
at
the
idea
of
being
murdered
,
or
wounded
,
or
insulted
,
as
at
the
*NL*
thought
that
if
such
things
were
to
happen
he
would
be
made
to
look
*NL*
ridiculous
in
the
eyes
of
society
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
knew
well
that
Nastasia
thoroughly
understood
him
and
where
to
wound
*NL*
him
and
how
,
and
therefore
,
as
the
marriage
was
still
only
in
embryo
,
*NL*
Totski
decided
to
conciliate
her
by
giving
it
up
.
His
decision
was
*NL*
strengthened
by
the
fact
that
Nastasia
Philipovna
had
curiously
altered
*NL*
of
late
.
It
would
be
difficult
to
conceive
how
different
she
was
*NL*
physically
,
at
the
present
time
,
to
the
girl
of
a
few
years
ago
.
She
was
*NL*
pretty
then
...
but
now
!
...
Totski
laughed
angrily
when
he
thought
how
*NL*
short-sighted
he
had
been
.
In
days
gone
by
he
remembered
how
he
had
*NL*
looked
at
her
beautiful
eyes
,
how
even
then
he
had
marvelled
at
their
*NL*
dark
mysterious
depths
,
and
at
their
wondering
gaze
which
seemed
to
seek
*NL*
an
answer
to
some
unknown
riddle
.
Her
complexion
also
had
altered
.
She
*NL*
was
now
exceedingly
pale
,
but
,
curiously
,
this
change
only
made
her
more
*NL*
beautiful
.
Like
most
men
of
the
world
,
Totski
had
rather
despised
such
*NL*
a
cheaply-bought
conquest
,
but
of
late
years
he
had
begun
to
think
*NL*
differently
about
it
.
It
had
struck
him
as
long
ago
as
last
spring
that
*NL*
he
ought
to
be
finding
a
good
match
for
Nastasia
;
for
instance
,
some
*NL*
respectable
and
reasonable
young
fellow
serving
in
a
government
office
*NL*
in
another
part
of
the
country
.
How
maliciously
Nastasia
laughed
at
the
*NL*
idea
of
such
a
thing
,
now
!
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
it
appeared
to
Totski
that
he
might
make
use
of
her
in
another
*NL*
way
;
and
he
determined
to
establish
her
in
St.
Petersburg
,
surrounding
*NL*
her
with
all
the
comforts
and
luxuries
that
his
wealth
could
command
.
In
*NL*
this
way
he
might
gain
glory
in
certain
circles
.
*NL*
*NL*
Five
years
of
this
Petersburg
life
went
by
,
and
,
of
course
,
during
that
*NL*
time
a
great
deal
happened
.
Totski
's
position
was
very
uncomfortable
;
*NL*
having
``
funked
''
once
,
he
could
not
totally
regain
his
ease
.
He
was
*NL*
afraid
,
he
did
not
know
why
,
but
he
was
simply
_
afraid
_
of
Nastasia
*NL*
Philipovna
.
For
the
first
two
years
or
so
he
had
suspected
that
she
*NL*
wished
to
marry
him
herself
,
and
that
only
her
vanity
prevented
her
*NL*
telling
him
so
.
He
thought
that
she
wanted
him
to
approach
her
with
a
*NL*
humble
proposal
from
his
own
side
.
But
to
his
great
,
and
not
entirely
*NL*
pleasurable
amazement
,
he
discovered
that
this
was
by
no
means
the
case
,
*NL*
and
that
were
he
to
offer
himself
he
would
be
refused
.
He
could
not
*NL*
understand
such
a
state
of
things
,
and
was
obliged
to
conclude
that
it
*NL*
was
pride
,
the
pride
of
an
injured
and
imaginative
woman
,
which
had
*NL*
gone
to
such
lengths
that
it
preferred
to
sit
and
nurse
its
contempt
and
*NL*
hatred
in
solitude
rather
than
mount
to
heights
of
hitherto
unattainable
*NL*
splendour
.
To
make
matters
worse
,
she
was
quite
impervious
to
mercenary
*NL*
considerations
,
and
could
not
be
bribed
in
any
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Finally
,
Totski
took
cunning
means
to
try
to
break
his
chains
and
*NL*
be
free
.
He
tried
to
tempt
her
in
various
ways
to
lose
her
heart
;
he
*NL*
invited
princes
,
hussars
,
secretaries
of
embassies
,
poets
,
novelists
,
*NL*
even
Socialists
,
to
see
her
;
but
not
one
of
them
all
made
the
faintest
*NL*
impression
upon
Nastasia
.
It
was
as
though
she
had
a
pebble
in
place
*NL*
of
a
heart
,
as
though
her
feelings
and
affections
were
dried
up
and
*NL*
withered
for
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
lived
almost
entirely
alone
;
she
read
,
she
studied
,
she
loved
music
.
*NL*
Her
principal
acquaintances
were
poor
women
of
various
grades
,
a
couple
*NL*
of
actresses
,
and
the
family
of
a
poor
schoolteacher
.
Among
these
people
*NL*
she
was
much
beloved
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
received
four
or
five
friends
sometimes
,
of
an
evening
.
Totski
*NL*
often
came
.
Lately
,
too
,
General
Epanchin
had
been
enabled
with
*NL*
great
difficulty
to
introduce
himself
into
her
circle
.
Gania
made
*NL*
her
acquaintance
also
,
and
others
were
Ferdishenko
,
an
ill-bred
,
and
*NL*
would-be
witty
,
young
clerk
,
and
Ptitsin
,
a
money-lender
of
modest
*NL*
and
polished
manners
,
who
had
risen
from
poverty
.
In
fact
,
Nastasia
*NL*
Philipovna
's
beauty
became
a
thing
known
to
all
the
town
;
but
not
a
*NL*
single
man
could
boast
of
anything
more
than
his
own
admiration
for
*NL*
her
;
and
this
reputation
of
hers
,
and
her
wit
and
culture
and
grace
,
all
*NL*
confirmed
Totski
in
the
plan
he
had
now
prepared
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
it
was
at
this
moment
that
General
Epanchin
began
to
play
so
large
*NL*
and
important
a
part
in
the
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Totski
had
approached
the
general
with
his
request
for
friendly
*NL*
counsel
as
to
a
marriage
with
one
of
his
daughters
,
he
had
made
a
full
*NL*
and
candid
confession
.
He
had
said
that
he
intended
to
stop
at
no
means
*NL*
to
obtain
his
freedom
;
even
if
Nastasia
were
to
promise
to
leave
him
*NL*
entirely
alone
in
future
,
he
would
not
-LRB-
he
said
-RRB-
believe
and
trust
her
;
*NL*
words
were
not
enough
for
him
;
he
must
have
solid
guarantees
of
some
*NL*
sort
.
So
he
and
the
general
determined
to
try
what
an
attempt
to
appeal
*NL*
to
her
heart
would
effect
.
Having
arrived
at
Nastasia
's
house
one
day
,
*NL*
with
Epanchin
,
Totski
immediately
began
to
speak
of
the
intolerable
*NL*
torment
of
his
position
.
He
admitted
that
he
was
to
blame
for
all
,
but
*NL*
candidly
confessed
that
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
feel
any
remorse
*NL*
for
his
original
guilt
towards
herself
,
because
he
was
a
man
of
sensual
*NL*
passions
which
were
inborn
and
ineradicable
,
and
that
he
had
no
power
*NL*
over
himself
in
this
respect
;
but
that
he
wished
,
seriously
,
to
marry
at
*NL*
last
,
and
that
the
whole
fate
of
the
most
desirable
social
union
which
*NL*
he
contemplated
,
was
in
her
hands
;
in
a
word
,
he
confided
his
all
to
her
*NL*
generosity
of
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
General
Epanchin
took
up
his
part
and
spoke
in
the
character
of
father
*NL*
of
a
family
;
he
spoke
sensibly
,
and
without
wasting
words
over
any
*NL*
attempt
at
sentimentality
,
he
merely
recorded
his
full
admission
of
*NL*
her
right
to
be
the
arbiter
of
Totski
's
destiny
at
this
moment
.
He
then
*NL*
pointed
out
that
the
fate
of
his
daughter
,
and
very
likely
of
both
his
*NL*
other
daughters
,
now
hung
upon
her
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
Nastasia
's
question
as
to
what
they
wished
her
to
do
,
Totski
*NL*
confessed
that
he
had
been
so
frightened
by
her
,
five
years
ago
,
that
*NL*
he
could
never
now
be
entirely
comfortable
until
she
herself
married
.
He
*NL*
immediately
added
that
such
a
suggestion
from
him
would
,
of
course
,
be
*NL*
absurd
,
unless
accompanied
by
remarks
of
a
more
pointed
nature
.
He
*NL*
very
well
knew
,
he
said
,
that
a
certain
young
gentleman
of
good
family
,
*NL*
namely
,
Gavrila
Ardalionovitch
Ivolgin
,
with
whom
she
was
acquainted
,
*NL*
and
whom
she
received
at
her
house
,
had
long
loved
her
passionately
,
*NL*
and
would
give
his
life
for
some
response
from
her
.
The
young
fellow
had
*NL*
confessed
this
love
of
his
to
him
-LRB-
Totski
-RRB-
and
had
also
admitted
it
in
*NL*
the
hearing
of
his
benefactor
,
General
Epanchin
.
Lastly
,
he
could
not
*NL*
help
being
of
opinion
that
Nastasia
must
be
aware
of
Gania
's
love
for
*NL*
her
,
and
if
he
-LRB-
Totski
-RRB-
mistook
not
,
she
had
looked
with
some
favour
*NL*
upon
it
,
being
often
lonely
,
and
rather
tired
of
her
present
life
.
*NL*
Having
remarked
how
difficult
it
was
for
him
,
of
all
people
,
to
speak
*NL*
to
her
of
these
matters
,
Totski
concluded
by
saying
that
he
trusted
*NL*
Nastasia
Philipovna
would
not
look
with
contempt
upon
him
if
he
now
*NL*
expressed
his
sincere
desire
to
guarantee
her
future
by
a
gift
of
*NL*
seventy-five
thousand
roubles
.
He
added
that
the
sum
would
have
been
*NL*
left
her
all
the
same
in
his
will
,
and
that
therefore
she
must
not
*NL*
consider
the
gift
as
in
any
way
an
indemnification
to
her
for
anything
,
*NL*
but
that
there
was
no
reason
,
after
all
,
why
a
man
should
not
be
allowed
*NL*
to
entertain
a
natural
desire
to
lighten
his
conscience
,
etc.
,
etc.
;
in
*NL*
fact
,
all
that
would
naturally
be
said
under
the
circumstances
.
Totski
*NL*
was
very
eloquent
all
through
,
and
,
in
conclusion
,
just
touched
on
the
*NL*
fact
that
not
a
soul
in
the
world
,
not
even
General
Epanchin
,
had
ever
*NL*
heard
a
word
about
the
above
seventy-five
thousand
roubles
,
and
that
*NL*
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever
given
expression
to
his
intentions
*NL*
in
respect
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nastasia
Philipovna
's
reply
to
this
long
rigmarole
astonished
both
the
*NL*
friends
considerably
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
only
was
there
no
trace
of
her
former
irony
,
of
her
old
hatred
and
*NL*
enmity
,
and
of
that
dreadful
laughter
,
the
very
recollection
of
which
*NL*
sent
a
cold
chill
down
Totski
's
back
to
this
very
day
;
but
she
seemed
*NL*
charmed
and
really
glad
to
have
the
opportunity
of
talking
seriously
*NL*
with
him
for
once
in
a
way
.
She
confessed
that
she
had
long
wished
to
*NL*
have
a
frank
and
free
conversation
and
to
ask
for
friendly
advice
,
but
*NL*
that
pride
had
hitherto
prevented
her
;
now
,
however
,
that
the
ice
was
*NL*
broken
,
nothing
could
be
more
welcome
to
her
than
this
opportunity
.
*NL*
*NL*
First
,
with
a
sad
smile
,
and
then
with
a
twinkle
of
merriment
in
her
*NL*
eyes
,
she
admitted
that
such
a
storm
as
that
of
five
years
ago
was
now
*NL*
quite
out
of
the
question
.
She
said
that
she
had
long
since
changed
*NL*
her
views
of
things
,
and
recognized
that
facts
must
be
taken
into
*NL*
consideration
in
spite
of
the
feelings
of
the
heart
.
What
was
done
was
*NL*
done
and
ended
,
and
she
could
not
understand
why
Totski
should
still
*NL*
feel
alarmed
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
next
turned
to
General
Epanchin
and
observed
,
most
courteously
,
that
*NL*
she
had
long
since
known
of
his
daughters
,
and
that
she
had
heard
none
*NL*
but
good
report
;
that
she
had
learned
to
think
of
them
with
deep
and
*NL*
sincere
respect
.
The
idea
alone
that
she
could
in
any
way
serve
them
,
*NL*
would
be
to
her
both
a
pride
and
a
source
of
real
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
true
that
she
was
lonely
in
her
present
life
;
Totski
had
judged
*NL*
her
thoughts
aright
.
She
longed
to
rise
,
if
not
to
love
,
at
least
to
*NL*
family
life
and
new
hopes
and
objects
,
but
as
to
Gavrila
Ardalionovitch
,
*NL*
she
could
not
as
yet
say
much
.
She
thought
it
must
be
the
case
that
he
*NL*
loved
her
;
she
felt
that
she
too
might
learn
to
love
him
,
if
she
could
*NL*
be
sure
of
the
firmness
of
his
attachment
to
herself
;
but
he
was
very
*NL*
young
,
and
it
was
a
difficult
question
to
decide
.
What
she
specially
*NL*
liked
about
him
was
that
he
worked
,
and
supported
his
family
by
his
*NL*
toil
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
heard
that
he
was
proud
and
ambitious
;
she
had
heard
much
that
*NL*
was
interesting
of
his
mother
and
sister
,
she
had
heard
of
them
from
Mr.
*NL*
Ptitsin
,
and
would
much
like
to
make
their
acquaintance
,
but
--
another
*NL*
question
!
--
would
they
like
to
receive
her
into
their
house
?
At
all
*NL*
events
,
though
she
did
not
reject
the
idea
of
this
marriage
,
she
desired
*NL*
not
to
be
hurried
.
As
for
the
seventy-five
thousand
roubles
,
Mr.
Totski
*NL*
need
not
have
found
any
difficulty
or
awkwardness
about
the
matter
;
she
*NL*
quite
understood
the
value
of
money
,
and
would
,
of
course
,
accept
the
*NL*
gift
.
She
thanked
him
for
his
delicacy
,
however
,
but
saw
no
reason
why
*NL*
Gavrila
Ardalionovitch
should
not
know
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
would
not
marry
the
latter
,
she
said
,
until
she
felt
persuaded
that
*NL*
neither
on
his
part
nor
on
the
part
of
his
family
did
there
exist
any
*NL*
sort
of
concealed
suspicions
as
to
herself
.
She
did
not
intend
to
ask
*NL*
forgiveness
for
anything
in
the
past
,
which
fact
she
desired
to
be
*NL*
known
.
She
did
not
consider
herself
to
blame
for
anything
that
had
*NL*
happened
in
former
years
,
and
she
thought
that
Gavrila
Ardalionovitch
*NL*
should
be
informed
as
to
the
relations
which
had
existed
between
herself
*NL*
and
Totski
during
the
last
five
years
.
If
she
accepted
this
money
it
was
*NL*
not
to
be
considered
as
indemnification
for
her
misfortune
as
a
young
*NL*
girl
,
which
had
not
been
in
any
degree
her
own
fault
,
but
merely
as
*NL*
compensation
for
her
ruined
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
became
so
excited
and
agitated
during
all
these
explanations
and
*NL*
confessions
that
General
Epanchin
was
highly
gratified
,
and
considered
*NL*
the
matter
satisfactorily
arranged
once
for
all
.
But
the
once
bitten
*NL*
Totski
was
twice
shy
,
and
looked
for
hidden
snakes
among
the
flowers
.
*NL*
However
,
the
special
point
to
which
the
two
friends
particularly
trusted
*NL*
to
bring
about
their
object
-LRB-
namely
,
Gania
's
attractiveness
for
Nastasia
*NL*
Philipovna
-RRB-
,
stood
out
more
and
more
prominently
;
the
pourparlers
had
*NL*
commenced
,
and
gradually
even
Totski
began
to
believe
in
the
possibility
*NL*
of
success
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
long
Nastasia
and
Gania
had
talked
the
matter
over
.
Very
*NL*
little
was
said
--
her
modesty
seemed
to
suffer
under
the
infliction
*NL*
of
discussing
such
a
question
.
But
she
recognized
his
love
,
on
the
*NL*
understanding
that
she
bound
herself
to
nothing
whatever
,
and
that
*NL*
she
reserved
the
right
to
say
``
no
''
up
to
the
very
hour
of
the
marriage
*NL*
ceremony
.
Gania
was
to
have
the
same
right
of
refusal
at
the
last
*NL*
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
soon
became
clear
to
Gania
,
after
scenes
of
wrath
and
quarrellings
*NL*
at
the
domestic
hearth
,
that
his
family
were
seriously
opposed
to
the
*NL*
match
,
and
that
Nastasia
was
aware
of
this
fact
was
equally
evident
.
She
*NL*
said
nothing
about
it
,
though
he
daily
expected
her
to
do
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
several
rumours
afloat
,
before
long
,
which
upset
Totski
's
*NL*
equanimity
a
good
deal
,
but
we
will
not
now
stop
to
describe
them
;
*NL*
merely
mentioning
an
instance
or
two
.
One
was
that
Nastasia
had
entered
*NL*
into
close
and
secret
relations
with
the
Epanchin
girls
--
a
most
unlikely
*NL*
rumour
;
another
was
that
Nastasia
had
long
satisfied
herself
of
the
fact
*NL*
that
Gania
was
merely
marrying
her
for
money
,
and
that
his
nature
was
*NL*
gloomy
and
greedy
,
impatient
and
selfish
,
to
an
extraordinary
degree
;
*NL*
and
that
although
he
had
been
keen
enough
in
his
desire
to
achieve
a
*NL*
conquest
before
,
yet
since
the
two
friends
had
agreed
to
exploit
his
*NL*
passion
for
their
own
purposes
,
it
was
clear
enough
that
he
had
begun
to
*NL*
consider
the
whole
thing
a
nuisance
and
a
nightmare
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
his
heart
passion
and
hate
seemed
to
hold
divided
sway
,
and
although
*NL*
he
had
at
last
given
his
consent
to
marry
the
woman
-LRB-
as
he
said
-RRB-
,
under
*NL*
the
stress
of
circumstances
,
yet
he
promised
himself
that
he
would
``
take
*NL*
it
out
of
her
,
''
after
marriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nastasia
seemed
to
Totski
to
have
divined
all
this
,
and
to
be
preparing
*NL*
something
on
her
own
account
,
which
frightened
him
to
such
an
extent
*NL*
that
he
did
not
dare
communicate
his
views
even
to
the
general
.
But
at
*NL*
times
he
would
pluck
up
his
courage
and
be
full
of
hope
and
good
spirits
*NL*
again
,
acting
,
in
fact
,
as
weak
men
do
act
in
such
circumstances
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
both
the
friends
felt
that
the
thing
looked
rosy
indeed
when
*NL*
one
day
Nastasia
informed
them
that
she
would
give
her
final
answer
on
*NL*
the
evening
of
her
birthday
,
which
anniversary
was
due
in
a
very
short
*NL*
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
strange
rumour
began
to
circulate
,
meanwhile
;
no
less
than
that
*NL*
the
respectable
and
highly
respected
General
Epanchin
was
himself
so
*NL*
fascinated
by
Nastasia
Philipovna
that
his
feeling
for
her
amounted
*NL*
almost
to
passion
.
What
he
thought
to
gain
by
Gania
's
marriage
to
*NL*
the
girl
it
was
difficult
to
imagine
.
Possibly
he
counted
on
Gania
's
*NL*
complaisance
;
for
Totski
had
long
suspected
that
there
existed
some
*NL*
secret
understanding
between
the
general
and
his
secretary
.
At
all
*NL*
events
the
fact
was
known
that
he
had
prepared
a
magnificent
present
of
*NL*
pearls
for
Nastasia
's
birthday
,
and
that
he
was
looking
forward
to
the
*NL*
occasion
when
he
should
present
his
gift
with
the
greatest
excitement
*NL*
and
impatience
.
The
day
before
her
birthday
he
was
in
a
fever
of
*NL*
agitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Epanchin
,
long
accustomed
to
her
husband
's
infidelities
,
had
*NL*
heard
of
the
pearls
,
and
the
rumour
excited
her
liveliest
curiosity
and
*NL*
interest
.
The
general
remarked
her
suspicions
,
and
felt
that
a
grand
*NL*
explanation
must
shortly
take
place
--
which
fact
alarmed
him
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
the
reason
why
he
was
so
unwilling
to
take
lunch
-LRB-
on
the
morning
*NL*
upon
which
we
took
up
this
narrative
-RRB-
with
the
rest
of
his
family
.
*NL*
Before
the
prince
's
arrival
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
plead
business
,
*NL*
and
``
cut
''
the
meal
;
which
simply
meant
running
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
particularly
anxious
that
this
one
day
should
be
*NL*
passed
--
especially
the
evening
--
without
unpleasantness
between
himself
*NL*
and
his
family
;
and
just
at
the
right
moment
the
prince
turned
up
--
``
as
*NL*
though
Heaven
had
sent
him
on
purpose
,
''
said
the
general
to
himself
,
as
*NL*
he
left
the
study
to
seek
out
the
wife
of
his
bosom
.
*NL*
*NL*
V.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
General
Epanchin
was
a
proud
woman
by
nature
.
What
must
her
*NL*
feelings
have
been
when
she
heard
that
Prince
Muishkin
,
the
last
of
*NL*
his
and
her
line
,
had
arrived
in
beggar
's
guise
,
a
wretched
idiot
,
a
*NL*
recipient
of
charity
--
all
of
which
details
the
general
gave
out
for
*NL*
greater
effect
!
He
was
anxious
to
steal
her
interest
at
the
first
swoop
,
*NL*
so
as
to
distract
her
thoughts
from
other
matters
nearer
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Epanchin
was
in
the
habit
of
holding
herself
very
straight
,
and
*NL*
staring
before
her
,
without
speaking
,
in
moments
of
excitement
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
a
fine
woman
of
the
same
age
as
her
husband
,
with
a
slightly
*NL*
hooked
nose
,
a
high
,
narrow
forehead
,
thick
hair
turning
a
little
grey
,
*NL*
and
a
sallow
complexion
.
Her
eyes
were
grey
and
wore
a
very
curious
*NL*
expression
at
times
.
She
believed
them
to
be
most
effective
--
a
belief
*NL*
that
nothing
could
alter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
receive
him
!
Now
,
at
once
?
''
asked
Mrs.
Epanchin
,
gazing
vaguely
*NL*
at
her
husband
as
he
stood
fidgeting
before
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dear
me
,
I
assure
you
there
is
no
need
to
stand

ceremony

*NL*
him

''
the
general
explained
hastily
.
``
He
is
quite
a
child
,
not
to
say
*NL*
a
pathetic-looking
creature

He
has
fits
of
some
sort
,
and
has
just
*NL*
arrived
from
Switzerland
,
straight
from
the
station
,
dressed
like
a
*NL*
German
and
without
a
farthing
in
his
pocket
.
I
gave
him
twenty-five
*NL*
roubles
to
go
on
with
,
and
am
going
to
find
him
some
easy
place
in
one
*NL*
of
the
government
offices
.
I
should
like
you
to
ply
him
well
with
the
*NL*
victuals
,
my
dears
,
for
I
should
think
he
must
be
very
hungry

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
astonish
me

said
the
lady
,
gazing
as
before

Fits

hungry

too
!
What
sort
of
fits
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
they
do
n't
come
on
frequently

a
regular

to
be
fairly
educated

should
like
you

if
possible

the
general
added
,
making
slowly
for
the
door
,
``
to
put
him
*NL*
through
his
paces
a
bit

see
what
he
is
good
for

you
should
*NL*
be
kind

him

it
is
a
good
deed

you
know

just
as
you
like

he
is
a
sort
of
relation

I
thought
it

might
interest
you

see
the
young

that
this
is
so

*NL*
``

need
n't
stand
on
ceremony
with
him

must
*NL*
give
the
poor
fellow
something
to
eat
after
his
journey
;
especially
as
*NL*
he
has
not
the
least
idea
where
to
go
to

said
Alexandra
,
the
eldest
of
*NL*
the
girls
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Besides
,
he
's
quite
a
child

can
entertain
him
with
a
little
*NL*
hide-and-seek

in
case
of
need

said
Adelaida
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hide-and-seek

What
do
you
mean

inquired
Mrs.
Epanchin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

do
stop
pretending

Aglaya
,
in
vexation

*NL*
*NL*
The
general
rang
the
bell
and
gave
orders
that
the
prince
should
be
*NL*
shown
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
on
condition
that
he
has
a
napkin
under
his
chin

Mrs.
Epanchin

he

*NL*
*NL*
``
On

cried
Mrs.

Epanchin
to
her
retreating
husband
in
a
tone
of
excited
annoyance

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

his

added

*NL*
brusquely

*NL*
*NL*
``

Alexandra

shocked
at
her
rudeness

*NL*
Aglaya
stamped
her
foot

So

who

this

*NL*
*NL*
``
Abbot

our

seriously

with
deference

*NL*
*NL*
``
Pafnute

yes

And
who
was

*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Epanchin
put
these
questions
hastily
and
brusquely
,
and
when
the
*NL*
prince
answered
she
nodded
her
head
sagely
at
each
word
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Abbot
Pafnute
lived
in
the
fourteenth
century
,
''
began
the
prince
;
*NL*
``
he
was
in
charge
of
one
of
the
monasteries
on
the
Volga
,
about
where
*NL*
our
present
Kostroma
government
lies
.
He
went
to
Oreol
and
helped
in
the
*NL*
great
matters
then
going
on
in
the
religious
world
;
he
signed
an
edict
*NL*
there
,
and
I
have
seen
a
print
of
his
signature
;
it
struck
me
,
so
I
*NL*
copied
it
.
When
the
general
asked
me
,
in
his
study
,
to
write
something
*NL*
for
him
,
to
show
my
handwriting
,
I
wrote
`
The
Abbot
Pafnute
signed
*NL*
this

'
in
the
exact
handwriting
of
the
abbot
.
The
general
liked
it
very
*NL*
much
,
and
that
's
why
he
recalled
it
just
now

*NL*
*NL*

was
left

*NL*
*NL*

such

you

you
sit
here

opposite

she
continued
,
``
I

He

he

I
do

he
requires

*NL*
*NL*
``
Formerly

when
I
was
seven
years
old

so

I
believe
I
wore
one

usually
hold
my
napkin
on
my
knee
when
I
eat

*NL*
*NL*
``
Of

of
course

And
about
your

*NL*
*NL*
``
Fits

asked
the
prince
,
slightly
surprised
.
``
I
very
seldom
have
fits

I
do

the

may
be
bad
for

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
talks
very
well

said
Mrs.
Epanchin
,
who
still
continued
*NL*
to
nod
at
each
word
the
prince
spoke
.
``
I
really
did
not
expect
it
at
*NL*
all

in
fact

I
suppose
it
was
all
stuff
and
nonsense
on
the
general
's
*NL*
part
,
as
usual
.
Eat
away
,
prince
,
and
tell
me
where
you
were
born
,
and
*NL*
where
you
were
brought
up
.
I
wish
to
know
all
about
you
,
you
interest
me
*NL*
very
much
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
expressed
his
thanks
once
more
,
and
eating
heartily
the
*NL*
while
,
recommenced
the
narrative
of
his
life
in
Switzerland
,
all
of
*NL*
which
we
have
heard
before
.
Mrs.
Epanchin
became
more
and
more
pleased
*NL*
with
her
guest
;
the
girls
,
too
,
listened
with
considerable
attention
.
In
*NL*
talking
over
the
question
of
relationship
it
turned
out
that
the
prince
*NL*
was
very
well
up
in
the
matter
and
knew
his
pedigree
off
by
heart
.
It
*NL*
was
found
that
scarcely
any
connection
existed
between
himself
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Epanchin
,
but
the
talk
,
and
the
opportunity
of
conversing
about
her
*NL*
family
tree
,
gratified
the
latter
exceedingly
,
and
she
rose
from
the
*NL*
table
in
great
good
humour
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
all
go
to
my
boudoir
,
''
she
said
,
``
and
they
shall
bring
some
*NL*
coffee
in
there
.
That
's
the
room
where
we
all
assemble
and
busy
*NL*
ourselves
as
we
like
best
,
''
she
explained
.
``
Alexandra
,
my
eldest
,
*NL*
here
,
plays
the
piano

or
reads
or
sews
;
Adelaida
paints
landscapes
and
*NL*
portraits
-LRB-
but
never
finishes
any
-RRB-
;
and
Aglaya
sits
and
does
nothing
.
*NL*
I
do
n't
work
too
much
,
either
.
Here
we
are
,
now
;
sit
down
,
prince

near
*NL*
the
fire
and
talk
to
us

I
want
to
hear
you
relate
something

I
wish
*NL*
to
make
sure
of
you
first

then
tell
my
old
friend

Princess
*NL*
Bielokonski

about
you

I
wish
you

know
all
the
good

interest

Now
then

begin

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma
,
it
's
rather
a
strange
order

that

said
Adelaida
,
who
was
*NL*
fussing
among
her
paints
and
paint-brushes
at
the
easel
.
Aglaya
and
*NL*
Alexandra
had
settled
themselves
with
folded
hands
on
a
sofa
,
evidently
*NL*
meaning
to
be
listeners
.
The
prince
felt
that
the
general
attention
was
*NL*
concentrated
upon
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
refuse
to
say
a
word

I

were
ordered

observed
Aglaya

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

what

there
strange
about

Why

tell
us
something

I
want
to
judge
whether
he
is
a
good
story-teller
;
*NL*
anything
you

you
liked
Switzerland

was
your

anything

'll
begin
directly
and
tell
us
all
*NL*
about
it
beautifully

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
impression
was
forcible

the
prince
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
you
see

girls

said
the
impatient
lady
,
``
he

has

begun

you
*NL*

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
_
let
_
him
talk

said
Alexandra
.
``
This
prince
is
a
*NL*
great
humbug
and
by
no
means
an
idiot
,
''
she
whispered
to
Aglaya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
saw
that
at
once
,
''
replied
the
latter
.
``
I
do
n't
think
it
at
all
*NL*
nice
of
him
to
play
a
part
.
What
does
he
wish
to
gain
by
it
,
I
wonder
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
first
impression
was
a
very
strong
one
,
''
repeated
the
prince
.
``
When
*NL*
they
took
me
away
from
Russia
,
I
remember
I
passed
through
many
German
*NL*
towns
and
looked
out
of
the
windows
,
but
did
not
trouble
so
much
as
to
*NL*
ask
questions
about
them
.
This
was
after
a
long
series
of
fits
.
I
always
*NL*
used
to
fall
into
a
sort
of
torpid
condition
after
such
a
series
,
and
*NL*
lost
my
memory
almost
entirely
;
and
though
I
was
not
altogether
without
*NL*
reason
at
such
times
,
yet
I
had
no
logical
power
of
thought
.
This
would
*NL*
continue
for
three
or
four
days
,
and
then
I
would
recover
myself
again
.
*NL*
I
remember
my
melancholy
was
intolerable
;
I
felt
inclined
to
cry
;
I
*NL*
sat
and
wondered
and
wondered
uncomfortably
;
the
consciousness
that
*NL*
everything
was
strange
weighed
terribly
upon
me
;
I
could
understand
that
*NL*
it
was
all
foreign
and
strange
.
I
recollect
I
awoke
from
this
state
for
*NL*
the
first
time
at
Basle
,
one
evening
;
the
bray
of
a
donkey
aroused
me
,
*NL*
a
donkey
in
the
town
market
.
I
saw
the
donkey
and
was
extremely
pleased
*NL*
with
it
,
and
from
that
moment
my
head
seemed
to
clear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
donkey
?
How
strange
!
Yet
it
is
not
strange
.
Anyone
of
us
might
fall
*NL*
in
love
with
a
donkey
!
It
happened
in
mythological
times
,
''
said
Madame
*NL*
Epanchin
,
looking
wrathfully
at
her
daughters
,
who
had
begun
to
laugh
.
*NL*
``
Go
on
,
prince
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Since
that
evening
I
have
been
specially
fond
of
donkeys
.
I
began
to
*NL*
ask
questions
about
them
,
for
I
had
never
seen
one
before
;
and
I
at
*NL*
once
came
to
the
conclusion
that
this
must
be
one
of
the
most
useful
of
*NL*
animals
--
strong
,
willing
,
patient
,
cheap
;
and
,
thanks
to
this
donkey
,
*NL*
I
began
to
like
the
whole
country
I
was
travelling
through
;
and
my
*NL*
melancholy
passed
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
this
is
very
strange
and
interesting
,
''
said
Mrs.
Epanchin
.
``
Now
*NL*
let
's
leave
the
donkey
and
go
on
to
other
matters
.
What
are
you
laughing
*NL*
at
,
Aglaya
?
and
you
too
,
Adelaida
?
The
prince
told
us
his
experiences
*NL*
very
cleverly
;
he
saw
the
donkey
himself
,
and
what
have
you
ever
seen
?
*NL*
_
you
_
have
never
been
abroad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
seen
a
donkey
though
,
mamma
!
''
said
Aglaya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
've
heard
one
!
''
said
Adelaida
.
All
three
of
the
girls
laughed
out
*NL*
loud
,
and
the
prince
laughed
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
's
too
bad
of
you
,
''
said
mamma
.
``
You
must
forgive
them
,
prince
;
*NL*
they
are
good
girls
.
I
am
very
fond
of
them
,
though
I
often
have
to
be
*NL*
scolding
them
;
they
are
all
as
silly
and
mad
as
march
hares
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
why
should
n't
they
laugh
?
''
said
the
prince
.
``
I
should
n't
have
let
*NL*
the
chance
go
by
in
their
place
,
I
know
.
But
I
stick
up
for
the
donkey
,
*NL*
all
the
same
;
he
's
a
patient
,
good-natured
fellow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
a
patient
man
,
prince
?
I
ask
out
of
curiosity
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Epanchin
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
laughed
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
wretched
donkey
again
,
I
see
!
''
cried
the
lady
.
``
I
assure
you
,
*NL*
prince
,
I
was
not
guilty
of
the
least
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Insinuation
?
Oh
!
I
assure
you
,
I
take
your
word
for
it
.
''
And
the
prince
*NL*
continued
laughing
merrily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
say
it
's
very
nice
of
you
to
laugh
.
I
see
you
really
are
a
*NL*
kind-hearted
fellow
,
''
said
Mrs.
Epanchin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
always
kind
,
though
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
kind
myself
,
and
_
always
_
kind
too
,
if
you
please
!
''
she
retorted
,
*NL*
unexpectedly
;
``
and
that
is
my
chief
fault
,
for
one
ought
not
to
be
*NL*
always
kind
.
I
am
often
angry
with
these
girls
and
their
father
;
but
the
*NL*
worst
of
it
is
,
I
am
always
kindest
when
I
am
cross
.
I
was
very
angry
*NL*
just
before
you
came
,
and
Aglaya
there
read
me
a
lesson
--
thanks
,
Aglaya
,
*NL*
dear
--
come
and
kiss
me
--
there
--
that
's
enough
''
she
added
,
as
Aglaya
came
*NL*
forward
and
kissed
her
lips
and
then
her
hand
.
``
Now
then
,
go
on
,
prince
.
*NL*
Perhaps
you
can
think
of
something
more
exciting
than
about
the
donkey
,
*NL*
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
say
,
again
,
_
I
_
ca
n't
understand
how
you
can
expect
anyone
to
tell
*NL*
you
stories
straight
away
,
so
,
''
said
Adelaida
.
``
I
know
I
never
could
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
the
prince
can
,
because
he
is
clever
--
cleverer
than
you
are
*NL*
by
ten
or
twenty
times
,
if
you
like
.
There
,
that
's
so
,
prince
;
and
*NL*
seriously
,
let
's
drop
the
donkey
now
--
what
else
did
you
see
abroad
,
*NL*
besides
the
donkey
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
the
prince
told
us
about
the
donkey
very
cleverly
,
all
the
*NL*
same
,
''
said
Alexandra
.
``
I
have
always
been
most
interested
to
hear
how
*NL*
people
go
mad
and
get
well
again
,
and
that
sort
of
thing
.
Especially
*NL*
when
it
happens
suddenly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
so
,
quite
so
!
''
cried
Mrs.
Epanchin
,
delighted
.
``
I
see
you
_
can
_
*NL*
be
sensible
now
and
then
,
Alexandra
.
You
were
speaking
of
Switzerland
,
*NL*
prince
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
We
came
to
Lucerne
,
and
I
was
taken
out
in
a
boat
.
I
felt
how
*NL*
lovely
it
was
,
but
the
loveliness
weighed
upon
me
somehow
or
other
,
and
*NL*
made
me
feel
melancholy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
asked
Alexandra
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
;
I
always
feel
like
that
when
I
look
at
the
beauties
of
*NL*
nature
for
the
first
time
;
but
then
,
I
was
ill
at
that
time
,
of
course
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
I
should
like
to
see
it
!
''
said
Adelaida
;
``
and
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
_
when
_
we
shall
ever
go
abroad

I
've
been
two
years
looking
out
for
a
good
*NL*
subject
for
a
picture
.
I
've
done
all
I
know

`
The
North

South
I

our
poet
observes

Do
help
me
to
a
subject

prince

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

I
know
nothing

paint
what
one
sees

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense

rubbish
you
talk

the
mother
struck
in
.
``
Not

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

that
's
better

said
Adelaida
;
``
the
prince

learned
to
see

abroad

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
hardly
know

I
only
went
to
restore
my
health

I
do

know
whether
I
learned

exactly

I
was
very
happy

however

*NL*
nearly
all
the
time

*NL*
*NL*
``
Happy

you
can
be
happy

cried
Aglaya
.
``
Then
how
can
you
say

not

us
_
to
see
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
_
do
_
teach
us

''
laughed
Adelaida
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
I
ca
n't
do
that
,
''
said
the
prince
,
laughing
too
.
``
I
lived
almost
*NL*
all
the
while
in
one
little
Swiss
village
;
what
can
I
teach
you
?
At
*NL*
first
I
was
only
just
not
absolutely
dull
;
then
my
health
began
to
*NL*
improve
--
then
every
day
became
dearer
and
more
precious
to
me
,
and
the
*NL*
longer
I
stayed
,
the
dearer
became
the
time
to
me
;
so
much
so
that
I
*NL*
could
not
help
observing
it
;
but
why
this
was
so
,
it
would
be
difficult
*NL*
to
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
that
you
did
n't
care
to
go
away
anywhere
else
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
at
first
I
did
;
I
was
restless
;
I
did
n't
know
however
I
should
*NL*
manage
to
support
life
--
you
know
there
are
such
moments
,
especially
in
*NL*
solitude
.
There
was
a
waterfall
near
us
,
such
a
lovely
thin
streak
of
*NL*
water
,
like
a
thread
but
white
and
moving
.
It
fell
from
a
great
height
,
*NL*
but
it
looked
quite
low
,
and
it
was
half
a
mile
away
,
though
it
did
not
*NL*
seem
fifty
paces
.
I
loved
to
listen
to
it
at
night
,
but
it
was
then
*NL*
that
I
became
so
restless
.
Sometimes
I
went
and
climbed
the
mountain
and
*NL*
stood
there
in
the
midst
of
the
tall
pines
,
all
alone
in
the
terrible
*NL*
silence
,
with
our
little
village
in
the
distance
,
and
the
sky
so
blue
,
*NL*
and
the
sun
so
bright
,
and
an
old
ruined
castle
on
the
mountain-side
,
*NL*
far
away
.
I
used
to
watch
the
line
where
earth
and
sky
met
,
and
longed
*NL*
to
go
and
seek
there
the
key
of
all
mysteries
,
thinking
that
I
might
*NL*
find
there
a
new
life
,
perhaps
some
great
city
where
life
should
be
*NL*
grander
and
richer
--
and
then
it
struck
me
that
life
may
be
grand
enough
*NL*
even
in
a
prison
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
read
that
last
most
praiseworthy
thought
in
my
manual
,
when
I
was
*NL*
twelve
years
old
,
''
said
Aglaya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
this
is
pure
philosophy
,
''
said
Adelaida
.
``
You
are
a
philosopher
,
*NL*
prince
,
and
have
come
here
to
instruct
us
in
your
views
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
you
are
right
,
''
said
the
prince
,
smiling
.
``
I
think
I
am
a
*NL*
philosopher
,
perhaps
,
and
who
knows
,
perhaps
I
do
wish
to
teach
my
views
*NL*
of
things
to
those
I
meet
with
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
philosophy
is
rather
like
that
of
an
old
woman
we
know
,
who
is
*NL*
rich
and
yet
does
nothing
but
try
how
little
she
can
spend
.
She
talks
of
*NL*
nothing
but
money
all
day
.
Your
great
philosophical
idea
of
a
grand
life
*NL*
in
a
prison
and
your
four
happy
years
in
that
Swiss
village
are
like
*NL*
this
,
rather
,
''
said
Aglaya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
to
life
in
a
prison
,
of
course
there
may
be
two
opinions
,
''
said
the
*NL*
prince
.
``
I
once
heard
the
story
of
a
man
who
lived
twelve
years
in
a
*NL*
prison
--
I
heard
it
from
the
man
himself
.
He
was
one
of
the
persons
under
*NL*
treatment
with
my
professor
;
he
had
fits
,
and
attacks
of
melancholy
,
*NL*
then
he
would
weep
,
and
once
he
tried
to
commit
suicide
.
_
His
_
life
in
*NL*
prison
was
sad
enough
;
his
only
acquaintances
were
spiders
and
a
tree
*NL*
that
grew
outside
his
grating-but
I
think
I
had
better
tell
you
of
*NL*
another
man
I
met
last
year
.
There
was
a
very
strange
feature
in
this
*NL*
case
,
strange
because
of
its
extremely
rare
occurrence
.
This
man
had
*NL*
once
been
brought
to
the
scaffold
in
company
with
several
others
,
and
*NL*
had
had
the
sentence
of
death
by
shooting
passed
upon
him
for
some
*NL*
political
crime
.
Twenty
minutes
later
he
had
been
reprieved
and
*NL*
some
other
punishment
substituted
;
but
the
interval
between
the
two
*NL*
sentences
,
twenty
minutes
,
or
at
least
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
had
been
*NL*
passed
in
the
certainty
that
within
a
few
minutes
he
must
die
.
I
was
*NL*
very
anxious
to
hear
him
speak
of
his
impressions
during
that
dreadful
*NL*
time
,
and
I
several
times
inquired
of
him
as
to
what
he
thought
and
*NL*
felt
.
He
remembered
everything
with
the
most
accurate
and
extraordinary
*NL*
distinctness
,
and
declared
that
he
would
never
forget
a
single
iota
of
*NL*
the
experience
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
twenty
paces
from
the
scaffold
,
where
he
had
stood
to
hear
the
*NL*
sentence
,
were
three
posts
,
fixed
in
the
ground
,
to
which
to
fasten
the
*NL*
criminals
-LRB-
of
whom
there
were
several
-RRB-
.
The
first
three
criminals
were
*NL*
taken
to
the
posts
,
dressed
in
long
white
tunics
,
with
white
caps
drawn
*NL*
over
their
faces
,
so
that
they
could
not
see
the
rifles
pointed
at
them
.
*NL*
Then
a
group
of
soldiers
took
their
stand
opposite
to
each
post
.
My
*NL*
friend
was
the
eighth
on
the
list
,
and
therefore
he
would
have
been
*NL*
among
the
third
lot
to
go
up
.
A
priest
went
about
among
them
with
a
*NL*
cross
:
and
there
was
about
five
minutes
of
time
left
for
him
to
live
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
said
that
those
five
minutes
seemed
to
him
to
be
a
most
interminable
*NL*
period
,
an
enormous
wealth
of
time
;
he
seemed
to
be
living
,
in
these
*NL*
minutes
,
so
many
lives
that
there
was
no
need
as
yet
to
think
of
that
*NL*
last
moment
,
so
that
he
made
several
arrangements
,
dividing
up
the
time
*NL*
into
portions
--
one
for
saying
farewell
to
his
companions
,
two
minutes
*NL*
for
that
;
then
a
couple
more
for
thinking
over
his
own
life
and
career
*NL*
and
all
about
himself
;
and
another
minute
for
a
last
look
around
.
He
*NL*
remembered
having
divided
his
time
like
this
quite
well
.
While
saying
*NL*
good-bye
to
his
friends
he
recollected
asking
one
of
them
some
very
*NL*
usual
everyday
question
,
and
being
much
interested
in
the
answer
.
Then
*NL*
having
bade
farewell
,
he
embarked
upon
those
two
minutes
which
he
had
*NL*
allotted
to
looking
into
himself
;
he
knew
beforehand
what
he
was
going
*NL*
to
think
about
.
He
wished
to
put
it
to
himself
as
quickly
and
clearly
*NL*
as
possible
,
that
here
was
he
,
a
living
,
thinking
man
,
and
that
in
three
*NL*
minutes
he
would
be
nobody
;
or
if
somebody
or
something
,
then
what
and
*NL*
where
?
He
thought
he
would
decide
this
question
once
for
all
in
these
*NL*
last
three
minutes
.
A
little
way
off
there
stood
a
church
,
and
its
*NL*
gilded
spire
glittered
in
the
sun
.
He
remembered
staring
stubbornly
at
*NL*
this
spire
,
and
at
the
rays
of
light
sparkling
from
it
.
He
could
not
*NL*
tear
his
eyes
from
these
rays
of
light
;
he
got
the
idea
that
these
rays
*NL*
were
his
new
nature
,
and
that
in
three
minutes
he
would
become
one
of
*NL*
them
,
amalgamated
somehow
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
repugnance
to
what
must
ensue
almost
immediately
,
and
the
*NL*
uncertainty
,
were
dreadful
,
he
said
;
but
worst
of
all
was
the
idea
,
*NL*
`
What
should
I
do
if
I
were
not
to
die
now
?
What
if
I
were
to
return
to
*NL*
life
again
?
What
an
eternity
of
days
,
and
all
mine
!
How
I
should
grudge
*NL*
and
count
up
every
minute
of
it
,
so
as
to
waste
not
a
single
instant
!
'
*NL*
He
said
that
this
thought
weighed
so
upon
him
and
became
such
a
terrible
*NL*
burden
upon
his
brain
that
he
could
not
bear
it
,
and
wished
they
would
*NL*
shoot
him
quickly
and
have
done
with
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
paused
and
all
waited
,
expecting
him
to
go
on
again
and
*NL*
finish
the
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
all
?
''
asked
Aglaya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
?
Yes
,
''
said
the
prince
,
emerging
from
a
momentary
reverie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
did
you
tell
us
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
happened
to
recall
it
,
that
's
all
!
It
fitted
into
the
*NL*
conversation
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
probably
wish
to
deduce
,
prince
,
''
said
Alexandra
,
``
that
moments
of
*NL*
time
can
not
be
reckoned
by
money
value
,
and
that
sometimes
five
minutes
*NL*
are
worth
priceless
treasures
.
All
this
is
very
praiseworthy
;
but
may
I
*NL*
ask
about
this
friend
of
yours
,
who
told
you
the
terrible
experience
of
*NL*
his
life
?
He
was
reprieved
,
you
say
;
in
other
words
,
they
did
restore
to
*NL*
him
that
`
eternity
of
days
.
'
What
did
he
do
with
these
riches
of
time
?
*NL*
Did
he
keep
careful
account
of
his
minutes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
he
did
n't
!
I
asked
him
myself
.
He
said
that
he
had
not
lived
a
*NL*
bit
as
he
had
intended
,
and
had
wasted
many
,
and
many
a
minute
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
then
there
's
an
experiment
,
and
the
thing
is
proved
;
one
*NL*
can
not
live
and
count
each
moment
;
say
what
you
like
,
but
one
_
can
not
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true
,
''
said
the
prince
,
``
I
have
thought
so
myself

And
yet
,
why
*NL*
should
n't
one
do
it
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
think
,
then
,
that
you
could
live
more
wisely
than
other
people
?

*NL*
said
Aglaya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
had
that
idea

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
have
it
still
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

I
have
it
still

''
the
prince
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
contemplated
Aglaya
until
now
,
with
a
pleasant
though
rather
*NL*
timid
smile
,
but
as
the
last
words
fell
from
his
lips
he
began
to
laugh
,
*NL*
and
looked
at
her
merrily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
very
modest
!
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
brave
you
are
!
''
said
he
.
``
You
are
laughing
,
and
I
--
that
man
's
*NL*
tale
impressed
me
so
much
,
that
I
dreamt
of
it
afterwards
;
yes
,
I
dreamt
*NL*
of
those
five
minutes
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
his
listeners
again
with
that
same
serious
,
searching
*NL*
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
angry
with
me
?
''
he
asked
suddenly
,
and
with
a
kind
of
*NL*
nervous
hurry
,
although
he
looked
them
straight
in
the
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
we
be
angry
?
''
they
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
because
I
seem
to
be
giving
you
a
lecture
,
all
the
time
!

*NL*
*NL*
At
this
they
laughed
heartily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
do
n't
be
angry
with
me
,
''
continued
the
prince
.
``
I
know
very
well
*NL*
that
I
have
seen
less
of
life
than
other
people
,
and
have
less
knowledge
*NL*
of
it
.
I
must
appear
to
speak
strangely
sometimes
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
the
last
words
nervously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
say
you
have
been
happy
,
and
that
proves
you
have
lived

not
less
,
*NL*

more
than
other
people
.
Why
make
all
these
excuses
?
''
interrupted
*NL*
Aglaya
in
a
mocking
tone
of
voice
.
``
Besides
,
you
need
not
mind
about
*NL*
lecturing
us
;
you
have
nothing
to
boast
of
.
With
your
quietism
,
one
*NL*
could
live
happily
for
a
hundred
years
at
least
.
One
might
show
you
the
*NL*
execution
of
a
felon
,
or
show
you
one
's
little
finger
.
You
could
draw
*NL*
a
moral
from
either
,
and
be
quite
satisfied
.
That
sort
of
existence
is
*NL*
easy
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
understand
why
you
always
fly
into
a
temper
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Epanchin
,
who
had
been
listening
to
the
conversation
and
examining
the
*NL*
faces
of
the
speakers
in
turn
.
``
I
do
not
understand
what
you
mean

What
*NL*
has
your
little
finger
to
do
with
it
?
The
prince
talks
well
,
though
he
*NL*
is
not
amusing
.
He
began
all
right
,
but
now
he
seems
sad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind

I
wish
you
had
seen
an
execution

Aglaya

Aglaya

I

guessed
it

happily
all

*NL*
*NL*
``
But

there
capital
punishment

you
were

asked
Adelaida
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
saw
it
at
Lyons

took
us
there

soon

arrived

we
came
in
for
that
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
did
you
like
it
very
much

Was
it
very
edifying

*NL*
instructive

asked
Aglaya

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I
did
n't
like
it
at
all

was
ill
after
seeing
it

I
confess

I
stared
as
though
my
eyes
were
fixed
to
the
sight

I
could
not
tear
*NL*
them
away

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

too

should
have
been
unable

away

Aglaya

*NL*
*NL*
``
They

are
condemned

*NL*
*NL*
``

contending

in
Adelaida

``

would
much
rather

the
prince

a
little
disturbed

and
frowning
slightly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You

Aglaya

with
a
mocking

*NL*
``
No

exclaimed
several
voices
at

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

the
one

waits
in
the
entrance

a
greyish

red-faced

*NL*
*NL*
``
The

Aglaya

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

Adelaida

*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
now
,
I
confess
,

began
the
prince
,
with
more
animation
,
``
when
you
*NL*
asked
me
for
a
subject
for
a
picture
,
I
confess
I
had
serious
thoughts
*NL*
of
giving
you
one
.
I
thought
of
asking
you
to
draw
the
face
of
a
*NL*
criminal
,
one
minute
before
the
fall
of
the
guillotine
,
while
the
*NL*
wretched
man
is
still
standing
on
the
scaffold
,
preparatory
to
placing
*NL*
his
neck
on
the
block
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
his
face
?
only
his
face
?
''
asked
Adelaida
.
``
That
would
be
a
*NL*
strange
subject
indeed
.
And
what
sort
of
a
picture
would
that
make
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
why
not
?
''
the
prince
insisted
,
with
some
warmth
.
``
When
I
was
in
*NL*
Basle
I
saw
a
picture
very
much
in
that
style
--
I
should
like
to
tell
you
*NL*
about
it
;
I
will
some
time
or
other
;
it
struck
me
very
forcibly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
shall
tell
us
about
the
Basle
picture
another
time
;
now
we
must
*NL*
have
all
about
the
execution
,
''
said
Adelaida
.
``
Tell
us
about
that
face
*NL*
as
;
it
appeared
to
your
imagination-how
should
it
be
drawn
?
--
just
the
*NL*
face
alone
,
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
just
a
minute
before
the
execution
,
''
began
the
prince
,
readily
,
*NL*
carried
away
by
the
recollection
and
evidently
forgetting
everything
*NL*
else
in
a
moment
;
``
just
at
the
instant
when
he
stepped
off
the
ladder
on
*NL*
to
the
scaffold
.
He
happened
to
look
in
my
direction
:
I
saw
his
eyes
and
*NL*
understood
all
,
at
once
--
but
how
am
I
to
describe
it
?
I
do
so
wish
you
*NL*
or
somebody
else
could
draw
it
,
you
,
if
possible
.
I
thought
at
the
time
*NL*
what
a
picture
it
would
make
.
You
must
imagine
all
that
went
before
,
of
*NL*
course
,
all
--
all
.
He
had
lived
in
the
prison
for
some
time
and
had
not
*NL*
expected
that
the
execution
would
take
place
for
at
least
a
week
yet
--
he
*NL*
had
counted
on
all
the
formalities
and
so
on
taking
time
;
but
it
so
*NL*
happened
that
his
papers
had
been
got
ready
quickly
.
At
five
o'clock
in
*NL*
the
morning
he
was
asleep
--
it
was
October
,
and
at
five
in
the
morning
*NL*
it
was
cold
and
dark
.
The
governor
of
the
prison
comes
in
on
tip-toe
and
*NL*
touches
the
sleeping
man
's
shoulder
gently
.
He
starts
up
.
`
What
is
it
?
'
*NL*
he
says
.
`
The
execution
is
fixed
for
ten
o'clock
.
'
He
was
only
just
*NL*
awake
,
and
would
not
believe
at
first
,
but
began
to
argue
that
his
*NL*
papers
would
not
be
out
for
a
week
,
and
so
on
.
When
he
was
wide
awake
*NL*
and
realized
the
truth
,
he
became
very
silent
and
argued
no
more
--
so
*NL*
they
say
;
but
after
a
bit
he
said
:
`
It
comes
very
hard
on
one
so
*NL*
suddenly
'
and
then
he
was
silent
again
and
said
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
three
or
four
hours
went
by
,
of
course
,
in
necessary
*NL*
preparations
--
the
priest
,
breakfast
,
-LRB-
coffee
,
meat
,
and
some
wine
they
*NL*
gave
him
;
does
n't
it
seem
ridiculous
?
-RRB-
And
yet
I
believe
these
people
*NL*
give
them
a
good
breakfast
out
of
pure
kindness
of
heart
,
and
believe
*NL*
that
they
are
doing
a
good
action
.
Then
he
is
dressed
,
and
then
begins
*NL*
the
procession
through
the
town
to
the
scaffold
.
I
think
he
,
too
,
*NL*
must
feel
that
he
has
an
age
to
live
still
while
they
cart
him
along
.
*NL*
Probably
he
thought
,
on
the
way
,
`
Oh
,
I
have
a
long
,
long
time
yet
.
*NL*
Three
streets
of
life
yet
!
When
we
've
passed
this
street
there
'll
be
*NL*
that
other
one
;
and
then
that
one
where
the
baker
's
shop
is
on
the
*NL*
right
;
and
when
shall
we
get
there
?
It
's
ages
,
ages
!
'
Around
him
are
*NL*
crowds
shouting
,
yelling
--
ten
thousand
faces
,
twenty
thousand
eyes
.
*NL*
All
this
has
to
be
endured
,
and
especially
the
thought
:
`
Here
are
ten
*NL*
thousand
men
,
and
not
one
of
them
is
going
to
be
executed
,
and
yet
I
am
*NL*
to
die
.
'
Well
,
all
that
is
preparatory
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
the
scaffold
there
is
a
ladder
,
and
just
there
he
burst
into
*NL*
tears
--
and
this
was
a
strong
man
,
and
a
terribly
wicked
one
,
they
say
!
*NL*
There
was
a
priest
with
him
the
whole
time
,
talking
;
even
in
the
cart
*NL*
as
they
drove
along
,
he
talked
and
talked
.
Probably
the
other
heard
*NL*
nothing
;
he
would
begin
to
listen
now
and
then
,
and
at
the
third
word
or
*NL*
so
he
had
forgotten
all
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
last
he
began
to
mount
the
steps
;
his
legs
were
tied
,
so
that
he
had
*NL*
to
take
very
small
steps
.
The
priest
,
who
seemed
to
be
a
wise
man
,
had
*NL*
stopped
talking
now
,
and
only
held
the
cross
for
the
wretched
fellow
to
*NL*
kiss
.
At
the
foot
of
the
ladder
he
had
been
pale
enough
;
but
when
he
set
*NL*
foot
on
the
scaffold
at
the
top
,
his
face
suddenly
became
the
colour
*NL*
of
paper
,
positively
like
white
notepaper
.
His
legs
must
have
become
*NL*
suddenly
feeble
and
helpless
,
and
he
felt
a
choking
in
his
throat
--
you
*NL*
know
the
sudden
feeling
one
has
in
moments
of
terrible
fear
,
when
one
*NL*
does
not
lose
one
's
wits
,
but
is
absolutely
powerless
to
move
?
If
some
*NL*
dreadful
thing
were
suddenly
to
happen
;
if
a
house
were
just
about
to
*NL*
fall
on
one
;
--
do
n't
you
know
how
one
would
long
to
sit
down
and
shut
*NL*
one
's
eyes
and
wait
,
and
wait
?
Well
,
when
this
terrible
feeling
came
*NL*
over
him
,
the
priest
quickly
pressed
the
cross
to
his
lips
,
without
a
*NL*
word
--
a
little
silver
cross
it
was
--
and
he
kept
on
pressing
it
to
the
*NL*
man
's
lips
every
second
.
And
whenever
the
cross
touched
his
lips
,
the
*NL*
eyes
would
open
for
a
moment
,
and
the
legs
moved
once
,
and
he
kissed
the
*NL*
cross
greedily
,
hurriedly
--
just
as
though
he
were
anxious
to
catch
hold
*NL*
of
something
in
case
of
its
being
useful
to
him
afterwards
,
though
he
*NL*
could
hardly
have
had
any
connected
religious
thoughts
at
the
time
.
And
*NL*
so
up
to
the
very
block
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
strange
that
criminals
seldom
swoon
at
such
a
moment
!
On
*NL*
the
contrary
,
the
brain
is
especially
active
,
and
works
*NL*
incessantly
--
probably
hard
,
hard
,
hard
--
like
an
engine
at
full
pressure
.
*NL*
I
imagine
that
various
thoughts
must
beat
loud
and
fast
through
*NL*
his
head
--
all
unfinished
ones
,
and
strange
,
funny
thoughts
,
very
*NL*
likely
!
--
like
this
,
for
instance
:
`
That
man
is
looking
at
me
,
and
he
*NL*
has
a
wart
on
his
forehead
!
and
the
executioner
has
burst
one
of
his
*NL*
buttons
,
and
the
lowest
one
is
all
rusty
!
'
And
meanwhile
he
notices
and
*NL*
remembers
everything
.
There
is
one
point
that
can
not
be
forgotten
,
round
*NL*
which
everything
else
dances
and
turns
about
;
and
because
of
this
*NL*
point
he
can
not
faint
,
and
this
lasts
until
the
very
final
quarter
of
*NL*
a
second
,
when
the
wretched
neck
is
on
the
block
and
the
victim
listens
*NL*
and
waits
and
_
knows
_
--
that
's
the
point
,
he
_
knows
_
that
he
is
just
_
now
_
*NL*
about
to
die
,
and
listens
for
the
rasp
of
the
iron
over
his
head
.
If
I
*NL*
lay
there
,
I
should
certainly
listen
for
that
grating
sound
,
and
hear
*NL*
it
,
too
!
There
would
probably
be
but
the
tenth
part
of
an
instant
left
*NL*
to
hear
it
in
,
but
one
would
certainly
hear
it
.
And
imagine
,
some
people
*NL*
declare
that
when
the
head
flies
off
it
is
_
conscious
_
of
having
flown
*NL*
off
!
Just
imagine
what
a
thing
to
realize
!
Fancy
if
consciousness
were
*NL*
to
last
for
even
five
seconds
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Draw
the
scaffold
so
that
only
the
top
step
of
the
ladder
comes
in
*NL*
clearly
.
The
criminal
must
be
just
stepping
on
to
it
,
his
face
as
white
*NL*
as
note-paper
.
The
priest
is
holding
the
cross
to
his
blue
lips
,
and
the
*NL*
criminal
kisses
it
,
and
knows
and
sees
and
understands
everything
.
*NL*
The
cross
and
the
head
--
there
's
your
picture
;
the
priest
and
the
*NL*
executioner
,
with
his
two
assistants
,
and
a
few
heads
and
eyes
below
.
*NL*
Those
might
come
in
as
subordinate
accessories
--
a
sort
of
mist
.
There
's
*NL*
a
picture
for
you
.
''
The
prince
paused
,
and
looked
around
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
that
is
n't
much
like
quietism

murmured
Alexandra
,
half
to
*NL*
herself

*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
tell
us
about
your

said
Adelaida
,
after
a
moment
's
*NL*
pause

*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
gazed
at
her
in
amazement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know

Adelaida
continued
,
``
you

us
a
description

first
I
wish
to
hear
how
you

in
love

Do
n't
deny
the
*NL*
fact
,
for
you
did

of
course

Besides

you
stop
philosophizing
when
you

are
telling
about
anything

*NL*
``
Why
are
you
ashamed

your
stories
the
moment

asked
Aglaya

suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
silly
you
are

said
Mrs.
Epanchin
,
looking
indignantly
towards
the
*NL*
last
speaker

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

that
was
n't
a
clever

said
Alexandra

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Mrs.
Epanchin

says
that
sort

of
thing
out
of
mischief

Do
n't
think
anything
of
their
nonsense

*NL*
means
nothing

They
love
to
chaff
,
but
they
like
you

I
can
see
it
in
*NL*
their
faces

I
know
their
faces

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
their

said
the
prince
,
with
a
peculiar
stress
on
*NL*
the
words

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
so
?

asked
Adelaida
,
with
curiosity

*NL*
*NL*
``

exclaimed
the
other
two

in
chorus

*NL*
*NL*
But
the
prince
was
silent
and
serious

All
awaited
his
reply

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
afterwards

he
said
quietly

Aglaya

Very

interrupted
Adelaida
,
``
then
if

read
faces

well

I
've
guessed

's
have
the
*NL*
secret
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
been

said
the
prince
,
as
quietly
and
seriously
as
*NL*
before
.
``
I
have
been
happy
in
another

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
,
how
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

I
'll
tell

said
the
prince
,
apparently
in
a
deep
reverie

*NL*
*NL*
VI
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
you
all
are
,
''
began
the
prince
,
``
settling
yourselves
down
to
*NL*
listen
to
me
with
so
much
curiosity
,
that
if
I
do
not
satisfy
you
you
*NL*
will
probably
be
angry
with
me
.
No
,
no
!
I
'm
only
joking
!
''
he
added
,
*NL*
hastily
,
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
--
they
were
all
children
there
,
and
I
was
always
among
*NL*
children
and
only
with
children
.
They
were
the
children
of
the
village
*NL*
in
which
I
lived
,
and
they
went
to
the
school
there
--
all
of
them
.
I
did
*NL*
not
teach
them
,
oh
no
;
there
was
a
master
for
that
,
one
Jules
Thibaut
.
*NL*
I
may
have
taught
them
some
things
,
but
I
was
among
them
just
as
an
*NL*
outsider
,
and
I
passed
all
four
years
of
my
life
there
among
them
.
*NL*
I
wished
for
nothing
better
;
I
used
to
tell
them
everything
and
hid
*NL*
nothing
from
them
.
Their
fathers
and
relations
were
very
angry
with
me
,
*NL*
because
the
children
could
do
nothing
without
me
at
last
,
and
used
to
*NL*
throng
after
me
at
all
times
.
The
schoolmaster
was
my
greatest
enemy
*NL*
in
the
end
!
I
had
many
enemies
,
and
all
because
of
the
children
.
Even
*NL*
Schneider
reproached
me
.
What
were
they
afraid
of
?
One
can
tell
a
child
*NL*
everything
,
anything
.
I
have
often
been
struck
by
the
fact
that
parents
*NL*
know
their
children
so
little
.
They
should
not
conceal
so
much
from
*NL*
them
.
How
well
even
little
children
understand
that
their
parents
*NL*
conceal
things
from
them
,
because
they
consider
them
too
young
to
*NL*
understand
!
Children
are
capable
of
giving
advice
in
the
most
important
*NL*
matters
.
How
can
one
deceive
these
dear
little
birds
,
when
they
look
*NL*
at
one
so
sweetly
and
confidingly
?
I
call
them
birds
because
there
is
*NL*
nothing
in
the
world
better
than
birds
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
However
,
most
of
the
people
were
angry
with
me
about
one
and
the
same
*NL*
thing
;
but
Thibaut
simply
was
jealous
of
me
.
At
first
he
had
wagged
his
*NL*
head
and
wondered
how
it
was
that
the
children
understood
what
I
told
*NL*
them
so
well
,
and
could
not
learn
from
him
;
and
he
laughed
like
anything
*NL*
when
I
replied
that
neither
he
nor
I
could
teach
them
very
much
,
but
*NL*
that
_
they
_
might
teach
us
a
good
deal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
he
could
hate
me
and
tell
scandalous
stories
about
me
,
living
among
*NL*
children
as
he
did
,
is
what
I
can
not
understand
.
Children
soothe
and
*NL*
heal
the
wounded
heart
.
I
remember
there
was
one
poor
fellow
at
our
*NL*
professor
's
who
was
being
treated
for
madness
,
and
you
have
no
idea
what
*NL*
those
children
did
for
him
,
eventually
.
I
do
n't
think
he
was
mad
,
but
*NL*
only
terribly
unhappy
.
But
I
'll
tell
you
all
about
him
another
day
.
Now
*NL*
I
must
get
on
with
this
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
children
did
not
love
me
at
first
;
I
was
such
a
sickly
,
awkward
*NL*
kind
of
a
fellow
then
--
and
I
know
I
am
ugly
.
Besides
,
I
was
a
foreigner
.
*NL*
The
children
used
to
laugh
at
me
,
at
first
;
and
they
even
went
so
far
*NL*
as
to
throw
stones
at
me
,
when
they
saw
me
kiss
Marie
.
I
only
kissed
her
*NL*
once
in
my
life
--
no
,
no
,
do
n't
laugh
!
''
The
prince
hastened
to
suppress
*NL*
the
smiles
of
his
audience
at
this
point
.
``
It
was
not
a
matter
of
_
love
_
*NL*
at
all
!
If
only
you
knew
what
a
miserable
creature
she
was
,
you
would
*NL*
have
pitied
her
,
just
as
I
did
.
She
belonged
to
our
village
.
Her
mother
*NL*
was
an
old
,
old
woman
,
and
they
used
to
sell
string
and
thread
,
and
soap
*NL*
and
tobacco
,
out
of
the
window
of
their
little
house
,
and
lived
on
the
*NL*
pittance
they
gained
by
this
trade
.
The
old
woman
was
ill
and
very
old
,
*NL*
and
could
hardly
move
.
Marie
was
her
daughter
,
a
girl
of
twenty
,
weak
*NL*
and
thin
and
consumptive
;
but
still
she
did
heavy
work
at
the
houses
*NL*
around
,
day
by
day
.
Well
,
one
fine
day
a
commercial
traveller
betrayed
*NL*
her
and
carried
her
off
;
and
a
week
later
he
deserted
her
.
She
came
home
*NL*
dirty
,
draggled
,
and
shoeless
;
she
had
walked
for
a
whole
week
without
*NL*
shoes
;
she
had
slept
in
the
fields
,
and
caught
a
terrible
cold
;
her
feet
*NL*
were
swollen
and
sore
,
and
her
hands
torn
and
scratched
all
over
.
She
*NL*
never
had
been
pretty
even
before
;
but
her
eyes
were
quiet
,
innocent
,
*NL*
kind
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
was
very
quiet
always
--
and
I
remember
once
,
when
she
had
suddenly
*NL*
begun
singing
at
her
work
,
everyone
said
,
`
Marie
tried
to
sing
today
!
'
*NL*
and
she
got
so
chaffed
that
she
was
silent
for
ever
after
.
She
had
been
*NL*
treated
kindly
in
the
place
before
;
but
when
she
came
back
now
--
ill
and
*NL*
shunned
and
miserable
--
not
one
of
them
all
had
the
slightest
sympathy
*NL*
for
her
.
Cruel
people
!
Oh
,
what
hazy
understandings
they
have
on
such
*NL*
matters
!
Her
mother
was
the
first
to
show
the
way
.
She
received
her
*NL*
wrathfully
,
unkindly
,
and
with
contempt
.
`
You
have
disgraced
me
,
'
she
*NL*
said
.
She
was
the
first
to
cast
her
into
ignominy
;
but
when
they
all
*NL*
heard
that
Marie
had
returned
to
the
village
,
they
ran
out
to
see
*NL*
her
and
crowded
into
the
little
cottage
--
old
men
,
children
,
women
,
*NL*
girls
--
such
a
hurrying
,
stamping
,
greedy
crowd
.
Marie
was
lying
on
*NL*
the
floor
at
the
old
woman
's
feet
,
hungry
,
torn
,
draggled
,
crying
,
*NL*
miserable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
everyone
crowded
into
the
room
she
hid
her
face
in
her
dishevelled
*NL*
hair
and
lay
cowering
on
the
floor
.
Everyone
looked
at
her
as
though
she
*NL*
were
a
piece
of
dirt
off
the
road
.
The
old
men
scolded
and
condemned
,
*NL*
and
the
young
ones
laughed
at
her
.
The
women
condemned
her
too
,
and
*NL*
looked
at
her
contemptuously
,
just
as
though
she
were
some
loathsome
*NL*
insect
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
mother
allowed
all
this
to
go
on
,
and
nodded
her
head
and
*NL*
encouraged
them
.
The
old
woman
was
very
ill
at
that
time
,
and
knew
she
*NL*
was
dying
-LRB-
she
really
did
die
a
couple
of
months
later
-RRB-
,
and
though
she
*NL*
felt
the
end
approaching
she
never
thought
of
forgiving
her
daughter
,
to
*NL*
the
very
day
of
her
death
.
She
would
not
even
speak
to
her
.
She
made
*NL*
her
sleep
on
straw
in
a
shed
,
and
hardly
gave
her
food
enough
to
support
*NL*
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marie
was
very
gentle
to
her
mother
,
and
nursed
her
,
and
did
everything
*NL*
for
her
;
but
the
old
woman
accepted
all
her
services
without
a
word
*NL*
and
never
showed
her
the
slightest
kindness
.
Marie
bore
all
this
;
and
*NL*
I
could
see
when
I
got
to
know
her
that
she
thought
it
quite
right
and
*NL*
fitting
,
considering
herself
the
lowest
and
meanest
of
creatures
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
the
old
woman
took
to
her
bed
finally
,
the
other
old
women
in
the
*NL*
village
sat
with
her
by
turns
,
as
the
custom
is
there
;
and
then
Marie
*NL*
was
quite
driven
out
of
the
house
.
They
gave
her
no
food
at
all
,
and
she
*NL*
could
not
get
any
work
in
the
village
;
none
would
employ
her
.
The
men
*NL*
seemed
to
consider
her
no
longer
a
woman
,
they
said
such
dreadful
things
*NL*
to
her
.
Sometimes
on
Sundays
,
if
they
were
drunk
enough
,
they
used
to
*NL*
throw
her
a
penny
or
two
,
into
the
mud
,
and
Marie
would
silently
pick
up
*NL*
the
money
.
She
had
began
to
spit
blood
at
that
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
last
her
rags
became
so
tattered
and
torn
that
she
was
ashamed
of
*NL*
appearing
in
the
village
any
longer
.
The
children
used
to
pelt
her
with
*NL*
mud
;
so
she
begged
to
be
taken
on
as
assistant
cowherd
,
but
the
cowherd
*NL*
would
not
have
her
.
Then
she
took
to
helping
him
without
leave
;
and
he
*NL*
saw
how
valuable
her
assistance
was
to
him
,
and
did
not
drive
her
away
*NL*
again
;
on
the
contrary
,
he
occasionally
gave
her
the
remnants
of
his
*NL*
dinner
,
bread
and
cheese
.
He
considered
that
he
was
being
very
kind
.
*NL*
When
the
mother
died
,
the
village
parson
was
not
ashamed
to
hold
Marie
*NL*
up
to
public
derision
and
shame
.
Marie
was
standing
at
the
coffin
's
*NL*
head
,
in
all
her
rags
,
crying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
crowd
of
people
had
collected
to
see
how
she
would
cry
.
The
parson
,
*NL*
a
young
fellow
ambitious
of
becoming
a
great
preacher
,
began
his
sermon
*NL*
and
pointed
to
Marie
.
`
There
,
'
he
said
,
`
there
is
the
cause
of
the
death
*NL*
of
this
venerable
woman
'
--
-LRB-
which
was
a
lie
,
because
she
had
been
ill
for
*NL*
at
least
two
years
-RRB-
--
`
there
she
stands
before
you
,
and
dares
not
lift
*NL*
her
eyes
from
the
ground
,
because
she
knows
that
the
finger
of
God
is
*NL*
upon
her
.
Look
at
her
tatters
and
rags
--
the
badge
of
those
who
lose
*NL*
their
virtue
.
Who
is
she
?
her
daughter
!
'
and
so
on
to
the
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
just
fancy
,
this
infamy
pleased
them
,
all
of
them
,
nearly
.
Only
the
*NL*
children
had
altered
--
for
then
they
were
all
on
my
side
and
had
learned
*NL*
to
love
Marie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
how
it
was
:
I
had
wished
to
do
something
for
Marie
;
I
longed
to
*NL*
give
her
some
money
,
but
I
never
had
a
farthing
while
I
was
there
.
But
*NL*
I
had
a
little
diamond
pin
,
and
this
I
sold
to
a
travelling
pedlar
;
he
*NL*
gave
me
eight
francs
for
it
--
it
was
worth
at
least
forty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
long
sought
to
meet
Marie
alone
;
and
at
last
I
did
meet
her
,
on
the
*NL*
hillside
beyond
the
village
.
I
gave
her
the
eight
francs
and
asked
her
*NL*
to
take
care
of
the
money
because
I
could
get
no
more
;
and
then
I
kissed
*NL*
her
and
said
that
she
was
not
to
suppose
I
kissed
her
with
any
evil
*NL*
motives
or
because
I
was
in
love
with
her
,
for
that
I
did
so
solely
out
*NL*
of
pity
for
her
,
and
because
from
the
first
I
had
not
accounted
her
as
*NL*
guilty
so
much
as
unfortunate
.
I
longed
to
console
and
encourage
her
*NL*
somehow
,
and
to
assure
her
that
she
was
not
the
low
,
base
thing
which
*NL*
she
and
others
strove
to
make
out
;
but
I
do
n't
think
she
understood
me
.
*NL*
She
stood
before
me
,
dreadfully
ashamed
of
herself
,
and
with
downcast
*NL*
eyes
;
and
when
I
had
finished
she
kissed
my
hand
.
I
would
have
kissed
*NL*
hers
,
but
she
drew
it
away
.
Just
at
this
moment
the
whole
troop
of
*NL*
children
saw
us
.
-LRB-
I
found
out
afterwards
that
they
had
long
kept
a
*NL*
watch
upon
me
.
-RRB-
They
all
began
whistling
and
clapping
their
hands
,
and
*NL*
laughing
at
us
.
Marie
ran
away
at
once
;
and
when
I
tried
to
talk
to
*NL*
them
,
they
threw
stones
at
me
.
All
the
village
heard
of
it
the
same
day
,
*NL*
and
Marie
's
position
became
worse
than
ever
.
The
children
would
not
let
*NL*
her
pass
now
in
the
streets
,
but
annoyed
her
and
threw
dirt
at
her
more
*NL*
than
before
.
They
used
to
run
after
her
--
she
racing
away
with
her
poor
*NL*
feeble
lungs
panting
and
gasping
,
and
they
pelting
her
and
shouting
*NL*
abuse
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Once
I
had
to
interfere
by
force
;
and
after
that
I
took
to
speaking
*NL*
to
them
every
day
and
whenever
I
could
.
Occasionally
they
stopped
and
*NL*
listened
;
but
they
teased
Marie
all
the
same
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
them
how
unhappy
Marie
was
,
and
after
a
while
they
stopped
their
*NL*
abuse
of
her
,
and
let
her
go
by
silently
.
Little
by
little
we
got
into
*NL*
the
way
of
conversing
together
,
the
children
and
I.
I
concealed
nothing
*NL*
from
them
,
I
told
them
all
.
They
listened
very
attentively
and
soon
*NL*
began
to
be
sorry
for
Marie
.
At
last
some
of
them
took
to
saying
*NL*
`
Good-morning
'
to
her
,
kindly
,
when
they
met
her
.
It
is
the
custom
there
*NL*
to
salute
anyone
you
meet
with
`
Good-morning
'
whether
acquainted
or
not
.
*NL*
I
can
imagine
how
astonished
Marie
was
at
these
first
greetings
from
the
*NL*
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Once
two
little
girls
got
hold
of
some
food
and
took
it
to
her
,
and
*NL*
came
back
and
told
me
.
They
said
she
had
burst
into
tears
,
and
that
they
*NL*
loved
her
very
much
now
.
Very
soon
after
that
they
all
became
fond
of
*NL*
Marie
,
and
at
the
same
time
they
began
to
develop
the
greatest
affection
*NL*
for
myself
.
They
often
came
to
me
and
begged
me
to
tell
them
stories
.
I
*NL*
think
I
must
have
told
stories
well
,
for
they
did
so
love
to
hear
them
.
*NL*
At
last
I
took
to
reading
up
interesting
things
on
purpose
to
pass
them
*NL*
on
to
the
little
ones
,
and
this
went
on
for
all
the
rest
of
my
time
*NL*
there
,
three
years
.
Later
,
when
everyone
--
even
Schneider
--
was
angry
with
*NL*
me
for
hiding
nothing
from
the
children
,
I
pointed
out
how
foolish
it
*NL*
was
,
for
they
always
knew
things
,
only
they
learnt
them
in
a
way
that
*NL*
soiled
their
minds
but
not
so
from
me
.
One
has
only
to
remember
one
's
*NL*
own
childhood
to
admit
the
truth
of
this
.
But
nobody
was
convinced
...
It
*NL*
was
two
weeks
before
her
mother
died
that
I
had
kissed
Marie
;
and
when
*NL*
the
clergyman
preached
that
sermon
the
children
were
all
on
my
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
told
them
what
a
shame
it
was
of
the
parson
to
talk
as
he
had
*NL*
done
,
and
explained
my
reason
,
they
were
so
angry
that
some
of
them
went
*NL*
and
broke
his
windows
with
stones
.
Of
course
I
stopped
them
,
for
that
*NL*
was
not
right
,
but
all
the
village
heard
of
it
,
and
how
I
caught
it
for
*NL*
spoiling
the
children
!
Everyone
discovered
now
that
the
little
ones
had
*NL*
taken
to
being
fond
of
Marie
,
and
their
parents
were
terribly
alarmed
;
*NL*
but
Marie
was
so
happy
.
The
children
were
forbidden
to
meet
her
;
but
*NL*
they
used
to
run
out
of
the
village
to
the
herd
and
take
her
food
and
*NL*
things
;
and
sometimes
just
ran
off
there
and
kissed
her
,
and
said
,
*NL*
'
_
Je
vous
aime
,
Marie
!
_
'
and
then
trotted
back
again
.
They
imagined
*NL*
that
I
was
in
love
with
Marie
,
and
this
was
the
only
point
on
which
*NL*
I
did
not
undeceive
them
,
for
they
got
such
enjoyment
out
of
it
.
And
*NL*
what
delicacy
and
tenderness
they
showed
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
evening
I
used
to
walk
to
the
waterfall
.
There
was
a
spot
there
*NL*
which
was
quite
closed
in
and
hidden
from
view
by
large
trees
;
and
to
*NL*
this
spot
the
children
used
to
come
to
me
.
They
could
not
bear
that
*NL*
their
dear
Leon
should
love
a
poor
girl
without
shoes
to
her
feet
and
*NL*
dressed
all
in
rags
and
tatters
.
So
,
would
you
believe
it
,
they
actually
*NL*
clubbed
together
,
somehow
,
and
bought
her
shoes
and
stockings
,
and
some
*NL*
linen
,
and
even
a
dress
!
I
ca
n't
understand
how
they
managed
it
,
but
*NL*
they
did
it
,
all
together
.
When
I
asked
them
about
it
they
only
laughed
*NL*
and
shouted
,
and
the
little
girls
clapped
their
hands
and
kissed
me
.
I
*NL*
sometimes
went
to
see
Marie
secretly
,
too
.
She
had
become
very
ill
,
and
*NL*
could
hardly
walk
.
She
still
went
with
the
herd
,
but
could
not
help
the
*NL*
herdsman
any
longer
.
She
used
to
sit
on
a
stone
near
,
and
wait
there
*NL*
almost
motionless
all
day
,
till
the
herd
went
home
.
Her
consumption
was
*NL*
so
advanced
,
and
she
was
so
weak
,
that
she
used
to
sit
with
closed
eyes
,
*NL*
breathing
heavily
.
Her
face
was
as
thin
as
a
skeleton
's
,
and
sweat
used
*NL*
to
stand
on
her
white
brow
in
large
drops
.
I
always
found
her
sitting
*NL*
just
like
that
.
I
used
to
come
up
quietly
to
look
at
her
;
but
Marie
*NL*
would
hear
me
,
open
her
eyes
,
and
tremble
violently
as
she
kissed
my
*NL*
hands
.
I
did
not
take
my
hand
away
because
it
made
her
happy
to
have
it
,
*NL*
and
so
she
would
sit
and
cry
quietly
.
Sometimes
she
tried
to
speak
;
but
*NL*
it
was
very
difficult
to
understand
her
.
She
was
almost
like
a
madwoman
,
*NL*
with
excitement
and
ecstasy
,
whenever
I
came
.
Occasionally
the
children
*NL*
came
with
me
;
when
they
did
so
,
they
would
stand
some
way
off
and
keep
*NL*
guard
over
us
,
so
as
to
tell
me
if
anybody
came
near
.
This
was
a
great
*NL*
pleasure
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
we
left
her
,
Marie
used
to
relapse
at
once
into
her
old
condition
,
*NL*
and
sit
with
closed
eyes
and
motionless
limbs
.
One
day
she
could
not
*NL*
go
out
at
all
,
and
remained
at
home
all
alone
in
the
empty
hut
;
but
*NL*
the
children
very
soon
became
aware
of
the
fact
,
and
nearly
all
of
them
*NL*
visited
her
that
day
as
she
lay
alone
and
helpless
in
her
miserable
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
two
days
the
children
looked
after
her
,
and
then
,
when
the
village
*NL*
people
got
to
know
that
Marie
was
really
dying
,
some
of
the
old
women
*NL*
came
and
took
it
in
turns
to
sit
by
her
and
look
after
her
a
bit
.
I
*NL*
think
they
began
to
be
a
little
sorry
for
her
in
the
village
at
last
;
*NL*
at
all
events
they
did
not
interfere
with
the
children
any
more
,
on
her
*NL*
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marie
lay
in
a
state
of
uncomfortable
delirium
the
whole
while
;
she
*NL*
coughed
dreadfully
.
The
old
women
would
not
let
the
children
stay
in
the
*NL*
room
;
but
they
all
collected
outside
the
window
each
morning
,
if
only
*NL*
for
a
moment
,
and
shouted
'
_
Bon
jour
,
notre
bonne
Marie
!
_
'
and
Marie
no
*NL*
sooner
caught
sight
of
,
or
heard
them
,
and
she
became
quite
animated
at
*NL*
once
,
and
,
in
spite
of
the
old
women
,
would
try
to
sit
up
and
nod
her
*NL*
head
and
smile
at
them
,
and
thank
them
.
The
little
ones
used
to
bring
*NL*
her
nice
things
and
sweets
to
eat
,
but
she
could
hardly
touch
anything
.
*NL*
Thanks
to
them
,
I
assure
you
,
the
girl
died
almost
perfectly
happy
.
She
*NL*
almost
forgot
her
misery
,
and
seemed
to
accept
their
love
as
a
sort
of
*NL*
symbol
of
pardon
for
her
offence
,
though
she
never
ceased
to
consider
*NL*
herself
a
dreadful
sinner
.
They
used
to
flutter
at
her
window
just
like
*NL*
little
birds
,
calling
out
:
'
_
Nous
t
`
aimons
,
Marie
!
_
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
died
very
soon
;
I
had
thought
she
would
live
much
longer
.
The
*NL*
day
before
her
death
I
went
to
see
her
for
the
last
time
,
just
before
*NL*
sunset
.
I
think
she
recognized
me
,
for
she
pressed
my
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Next
morning
they
came
and
told
me
that
Marie
was
dead
.
The
children
*NL*
could
not
be
restrained
now
;
they
went
and
covered
her
coffin
with
*NL*
flowers
,
and
put
a
wreath
of
lovely
blossoms
on
her
head
.
The
pastor
did
*NL*
not
throw
any
more
shameful
words
at
the
poor
dead
woman
;
but
there
were
*NL*
very
few
people
at
the
funeral
.
However
,
when
it
came
to
carrying
the
*NL*
coffin
,
all
the
children
rushed
up
,
to
carry
it
themselves
.
Of
course
*NL*
they
could
not
do
it
alone
,
but
they
insisted
on
helping
,
and
walked
*NL*
alongside
and
behind
,
crying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
have
planted
roses
all
round
her
grave
,
and
every
year
they
look
*NL*
after
the
flowers
and
make
Marie
's
resting-place
as
beautiful
as
they
*NL*
can
.
I
was
in
ill
odour
after
all
this
with
the
parents
of
the
children
,
*NL*
and
especially
with
the
parson
and
schoolmaster
.
Schneider
was
obliged
*NL*
to
promise
that
I
should
not
meet
them
and
talk
to
them
;
but
we
*NL*
conversed
from
a
distance
by
signs
,
and
they
used
to
write
me
sweet
*NL*
little
notes
.
Afterwards
I
came
closer
than
ever
to
those
little
souls
,
*NL*
but
even
then
it
was
very
dear
to
me
,
to
have
them
so
fond
of
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Schneider
said
that
I
did
the
children
great
harm
by
my
pernicious
*NL*
`
system
'
;
what
nonsense
that
was
!
And
what
did
he
mean
by
my
system
?
*NL*
He
said
afterwards
that
he
believed
I
was
a
child
myself
--
just
before
*NL*
I
came
away
.
`
You
have
the
form
and
face
of
an
adult
'
he
said
,
`
but
as
*NL*
regards
soul
,
and
character
,
and
perhaps
even
intelligence
,
you
are
a
*NL*
child
in
the
completest
sense
of
the
word
,
and
always
will
be
,
if
you
*NL*
live
to
be
sixty
.
'
I
laughed
very
much
,
for
of
course
that
is
nonsense
.
*NL*
But
it
is
a
fact
that
I
do
not
care
to
be
among
grown-up
people
and
*NL*
much
prefer
the
society
of
children
.
However
kind
people
may
be
to
me
,
I
*NL*
never
feel
quite
at
home
with
them
,
and
am
always
glad
to
get
back
to
*NL*
my
little
companions
.
Now
my
companions
have
always
been
children
,
not
*NL*
because
I
was
a
child
myself
once
,
but
because
young
things
attract
*NL*
me
.
On
one
of
the
first
days
of
my
stay
in
Switzerland
,
I
was
strolling
*NL*
about
alone
and
miserable
,
when
I
came
upon
the
children
rushing
noisily
*NL*
out
of
school
,
with
their
slates
and
bags
,
and
books
,
their
games
,
their
*NL*
laughter
and
shouts
--
and
my
soul
went
out
to
them
.
I
stopped
and
laughed
*NL*
happily
as
I
watched
their
little
feet
moving
so
quickly
.
Girls
and
*NL*
boys
,
laughing
and
crying
;
for
as
they
went
home
many
of
them
found
*NL*
time
to
fight
and
make
peace
,
to
weep
and
play
.
I
forgot
my
troubles
in
*NL*
looking
at
them
.
And
then
,
all
those
three
years
,
I
tried
to
understand
*NL*
why
men
should
be
for
ever
tormenting
themselves
.
I
lived
the
life
of
*NL*
a
child
there
,
and
thought
I
should
never
leave
the
little
village
;
*NL*
indeed
,
I
was
far
from
thinking
that
I
should
ever
return
to
Russia
.
*NL*
But
at
last
I
recognized
the
fact
that
Schneider
could
not
keep
me
any
*NL*
longer
.
And
then
something
so
important
happened
,
that
Schneider
himself
*NL*
urged
me
to
depart
.
I
am
going
to
see
now
if
can
get
good
advice
*NL*
about
it
.
Perhaps
my
lot
in
life
will
be
changed
;
but
that
is
not
the
*NL*
principal
thing
.
The
principal
thing
is
the
entire
change
that
has
*NL*
already
come
over
me
.
I
left
many
things
behind
me
--
too
many
.
They
have
*NL*
gone
.
On
the
journey
I
said
to
myself
,
'
I
am
going
into
the
world
of
*NL*
men
.
I
do
n't
know
much
,
perhaps
,
but
a
new
life
has
begun
for
me
.
'
I
*NL*
made
up
my
mind
to
be
honest
,
and
steadfast
in
accomplishing
my
task
.
*NL*
Perhaps
I
shall
meet
with
troubles
and
many
disappointments
,
but
I
have
*NL*
made
up
my
mind
to
be
polite
and
sincere
to
everyone
;
more
can
not
be
*NL*
asked
of
me
.
People
may
consider
me
a
child
if
they
like
.
I
am
often
*NL*
called
an
idiot
,
and
at
one
time
I
certainly
was
so
ill
that
I
was
*NL*
nearly
as
bad
as
an
idiot
;
but
I
am
not
an
idiot
now
.
How
can
I
possibly
*NL*
be
so
when
I
know
myself
that
I
am
considered
one
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
received
a
letter
from
those
dear
little
souls
,
while
passing
*NL*
through
Berlin
,
I
only
then
realized
how
much
I
loved
them
.
It
was
very
,
*NL*
very
painful
,
getting
that
first
little
letter
.
How
melancholy
they
had
*NL*
been
when
they
saw
me
off
!
For
a
month
before
,
they
had
been
talking
of
*NL*
my
departure
and
sorrowing
over
it
;
and
at
the
waterfall
,
of
an
evening
,
*NL*
when
we
parted
for
the
night
,
they
would
hug
me
so
tight
and
kiss
me
so
*NL*
warmly
,
far
more
so
than
before
.
And
every
now
and
then
they
would
turn
*NL*
up
one
by
one
when
I
was
alone
,
just
to
give
me
a
kiss
and
a
hug
,
to
*NL*
show
their
love
for
me
.
The
whole
flock
went
with
me
to
the
station
,
*NL*
which
was
about
a
mile
from
the
village
,
and
every
now
and
then
one
of
*NL*
them
would
stop
to
throw
his
arms
round
me
,
and
all
the
little
girls
had
*NL*
tears
in
their
voices
,
though
they
tried
hard
not
to
cry
.
As
the
train
*NL*
steamed
out
of
the
station
,
I
saw
them
all
standing
on
the
platform
*NL*
waving
to
me
and
crying
`
Hurrah
!
'
till
they
were
lost
in
the
distance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
assure
you
,
when
I
came
in
here
just
now
and
saw
your
kind
faces
-LRB-
I
*NL*
can
read
faces
well
-RRB-
my
heart
felt
light
for
the
first
time
since
that
*NL*
moment
of
parting
.
I
think
I
must
be
one
of
those
who
are
born
to
be
in
*NL*
luck
,
for
one
does
not
often
meet
with
people
whom
one
feels
he
can
love
*NL*
from
the
first
sight
of
their
faces
;
and
yet
,
no
sooner
do
I
step
out
of
*NL*
the
railway
carriage
than
I
happen
upon
you
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it
is
more
or
less
a
shamefaced
thing
to
speak
of
one
's
feelings
*NL*
before
others
;
and
yet
here
am
I
talking
like
this
to
you
,
and
am
not
*NL*
a
bit
ashamed
or
shy
.
I
am
an
unsociable
sort
of
fellow
and
shall
very
*NL*
likely
not
come
to
see
you
again
for
some
time
;
but
do
n't
think
the
*NL*
worse
of
me
for
that
.
It
is
not
that
I
do
not
value
your
society
;
and
*NL*
you
must
never
suppose
that
I
have
taken
offence
at
anything
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
asked
me
about
your
faces
,
and
what
I
could
read
in
them
;
I
will
*NL*
tell
you
with
the
greatest
pleasure
.
You
,
Adelaida
Ivanovna
,
have
a
very
*NL*
happy
face
;
it
is
the
most
sympathetic
of
the
three
.
Not
to
speak
of
*NL*
your
natural
beauty
,
one
can
look
at
your
face
and
say
to
one
's
self
,
*NL*
`
She
has
the
face
of
a
kind
sister
.
'
You
are
simple
and
merry
,
but
you
*NL*
can
see
into
another
's
heart
very
quickly
.
That
's
what
I
read
in
your
*NL*
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
too
,
Alexandra
Ivanovna
,
have
a
very
lovely
face
;
but
I
think
you
*NL*
may
have
some
secret
sorrow
.
Your
heart
is
undoubtedly
a
kind
,
good
one
,
*NL*
but
you
are
not
merry
.
There
is
a
certain
suspicion
of
`
shadow
'
in
your
*NL*
face
,
like
in
that
of
Holbein
's
Madonna
in
Dresden
.
So
much
for
your
*NL*
face
.
Have
I
guessed
right
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
for
your
face
,
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
,
I
not
only
think
,
but
am
*NL*
perfectly
_
sure
_
,
that
you
are
an
absolute
child
--
in
all
,
in
all
,
mind
,
*NL*
both
good
and
bad
--
and
in
spite
of
your
years
.
Do
n't
be
angry
with
me
*NL*
for
saying
so
;
you
know
what
my
feelings
for
children
are
.
And
do
not
*NL*
suppose
that
I
am
so
candid
out
of
pure
simplicity
of
soul
.
Oh
dear
no
,
*NL*
it
is
by
no
means
the
case
!
Perhaps
I
have
my
own
very
profound
object
*NL*
in
view

When
the
prince
ceased
speaking
all
were
gazing
merrily
at
him
--
even
*NL*
Aglaya
;
but
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
looked
the
jolliest
of
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!

she
cried
,
``
we
_
have
_
`
put
him
through
his
paces

with
a
*NL*
vengeance

My
dears

you
imagined

I
believe

that
you
were
about

to
patronize
this
young
gentleman
,
like
some
poor
_

picked
up
*NL*
somewhere

taken
under
your
magnificent
protection

What
fools
we
*NL*
were

what
a

big
fool
is
your
father
!
Well
done

prince

I
*NL*
assure
you
the
general
actually
asked
me
to
put
you
through
your
paces

*NL*
and
examine
you
.
As
to
what
you
said
about
my
face
,
you
are
absolutely
*NL*
correct
in
your
judgment
.
I
am
a
child
,
and
know
it

I
knew
it
long
*NL*
before
you
said
so
;
you
have
expressed
my
own
thoughts
.
I
think
your
*NL*
nature
and
mine
must
be
extremely
alike
,
and
I
am
very
glad
of
it
.
We
*NL*
are
like
two
drops
of
water
,
only
you
are
a
man

I
a
woman
,

I

*NL*
not

all
the
difference

us

entered

right

had
an
idea

unformed
as

a
*NL*
strange
idea

*NL*
*NL*
Gavrila
Ardalionovitch
was
still
sitting
in
the
study
,
buried
in
a
*NL*
mass
of
papers

He
looked
as
though
he
did
not
take
his
salary
from
the
*NL*
public
company
,
whose
servant
he
was
,
for
a
sinecure

*NL*
*NL*
He
grew
very
wroth
and
confused
when
the
prince
asked
for
the
portrait
,
*NL*
and
explained
how
it
came
about
that
he
had
spoken
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

curse
it
all

you
go
blabbing
for

nothing

he
added
,
muttering
*NL*
the
last
word
to
himself
in
irrepressible
rage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
sorry

I

not

almost
as
beautiful

Nastasia
Philipovna

*NL*
*NL*
Gania
asked
for
further
details
;
and
the
prince
once
more
repeated
the
*NL*
conversation

Gania
looked
at
him
with
ironical
contempt
the
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nastasia

he
began
,
and
there
paused
;
he
was
clearly
much
*NL*
agitated
and
annoyed

The
prince
reminded
him
of
the
portrait

*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen

Gania

just
struck
him

He
paused
again
,
he
was
trying
to
make
up
his
mind
to
something

*NL*
was
turning
the
matter
over

The
prince
waited
quietly
.
Once
more
Gania
*NL*
fixed
him
with
intent
and
questioning
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Prince

he
began
again
,
``
they
are
rather
angry
with

in
there

circumstance

I
need

so
that
I
do
not
care

I
have
written
a
few
words
in
case
I
shall
not
have
the
*NL*
chance
of
seeing
her
''
-LRB-
here
the
prince
observed
a
small
note
in
his
*NL*
hand
-RRB-
,
``
and
I
do
not
know
how
to
get
my
communication
to
her
.
Do
n't
you
*NL*
think
you
could
undertake
to
give
it
to
her
at
once
,
but
only
to
her
,
*NL*
mind
,
and
so
that
no
one
else
should
see
you
give
it
?
It
is
n't
much
of
a
*NL*
secret
,
but
still
--
Well
,
will
you
do
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
quite
like
it
,
''
replied
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
it
is
absolutely
necessary
for
me
,
''
Gania
entreated
.
``
Believe
*NL*
me
,
if
it
were
not
so
,
I
would
not
ask
you
;
how
else
am
I
to
get
it
to
*NL*
her
?
It
is
most
important
,
dreadfully
important
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gania
was
evidently
much
alarmed
at
the
idea
that
the
prince
would
not
*NL*
consent
to
take
his
note
,
and
he
looked
at
him
now
with
an
expression
of
*NL*
absolute
entreaty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
will
take
it
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
mind
,
nobody
is
to
see
!
''
cried
the
delighted
Gania
``
And
of
course
I
*NL*
may
rely
on
your
word
of
honour
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
show
it
to
anyone
,
''
said
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
letter
is
not
sealed
--
''
continued
Gania
,
and
paused
in
confusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
wo
n't
read
it
,
''
said
the
prince
,
quite
simply
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
up
the
portrait
,
and
went
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gania
,
left
alone
,
clutched
his
head
with
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
word
from
her
,
''
he
said
,
``
one
word
from
her
,
and
I
may
yet
be
*NL*
free
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
settle
himself
to
his
papers
again
,
for
agitation
and
*NL*
excitement
,
but
began
walking
up
and
down
the
room
from
corner
to
*NL*
corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
walked
along
,
musing
.
He
did
not
like
his
commission
,
and
*NL*
disliked
the
idea
of
Gania
sending
a
note
to
Aglaya
at
all
;
but
when
*NL*
he
was
two
rooms
distant
from
the
drawing-room
,
where
they
all
were
,
*NL*
he
stopped
as
though
recalling
something
;
went
to
the
window
,
nearer
the
*NL*
light
,
and
began
to
examine
the
portrait
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
longed
to
solve
the
mystery
of
something
in
the
face
of
Nastasia
*NL*
Philipovna
,
something
which
had
struck
him
as
he
looked
at
the
portrait
*NL*
for
the
first
time
;
the
impression
had
not
left
him
.
It
was
partly
the
*NL*
fact
of
her
marvellous
beauty
that
struck
him
,
and
partly
something
*NL*
else
.
There
was
a
suggestion
of
immense
pride
and
disdain
in
the
face
*NL*
almost
of
hatred
,
and
at
the
same
time
something
confiding
and
very
full
*NL*
of
simplicity
.
The
contrast
aroused
a
deep
sympathy
in
his
heart
as
*NL*
he
looked
at
the
lovely
face
.
The
blinding
loveliness
of
it
was
almost
*NL*
intolerable
,
this
pale
thin
face
with
its
flaming
eyes
;
it
was
a
strange
*NL*
beauty
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
gazed
at
it
for
a
minute
or
two
,
then
glanced
around
him
,
*NL*
and
hurriedly
raised
the
portrait
to
his
lips
.
When
,
a
minute
after
,
he
*NL*
reached
the
drawing-room
door
,
his
face
was
quite
composed
.
But
just
as
*NL*
he
reached
the
door
he
met
Aglaya
coming
out
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gavrila
Ardalionovitch
begged
me
to
give
you
this
,
''
he
said
,
handing
*NL*
her
the
note
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aglaya
stopped
,
took
the
letter
,
and
gazed
strangely
into
the
prince
's
*NL*
eyes
.
There
was
no
confusion
in
her
face
;
a
little
surprise
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
but
that
was
all
.
By
her
look
she
seemed
merely
to
challenge
the
prince
*NL*
to
an
explanation
as
to
how
he
and
Gania
happened
to
be
connected
in
*NL*
this
matter
.
But
her
expression
was
perfectly
cool
and
quiet
,
and
even
*NL*
condescending
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
they
stood
for
a
moment
or
two
,
confronting
one
another
.
At
length
a
*NL*
faint
smile
passed
over
her
face
,
and
she
passed
by
him
without
a
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Epanchin
examined
the
portrait
of
Nastasia
Philipovna
for
some
*NL*
little
while
,
holding
it
critically
at
arm
's
length
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
she
is
pretty
,
''
she
said
at
last
,
``
even
very
pretty
.
I
have
seen
*NL*
her
twice
,
but
only
at
a
distance
.
So
you
admire
this
kind
of
beauty
,
do
*NL*
you
?
''
she
asked
the
prince
,
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
do
--
this
kind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
especially
this
kind
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
especially
this
kind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
much
suffering
in
this
face
,
''
murmured
the
prince
,
more
as
*NL*
though
talking
to
himself
than
answering
the
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
are
wandering
a
little
,
prince
,
''
Mrs.
Epanchin
decided
,
*NL*
after
a
lengthened
survey
of
his
face
;
and
she
tossed
the
portrait
on
to
*NL*
the
table
,
haughtily
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
took
it
,
and
Adelaida
came
up
,
and
both
the
girls
examined
the
*NL*
photograph
.
Just
then
Aglaya
entered
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
power
!
''
cried
Adelaida
suddenly
,
as
she
earnestly
examined
the
*NL*
portrait
over
her
sister
's
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whom
?
What
power
?
''
asked
her
mother
,
crossly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Such
beauty
is
real
power
,
''
said
Adelaida
.
``
With
such
beauty
as
that
*NL*
one
might
overthrow
the
world
.
''
She
returned
to
her
easel
thoughtfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aglaya
merely
glanced
at
the
portrait
--
frowned
,
and
put
out
her
*NL*
underlip
;
then
went
and
sat
down
on
the
sofa
with
folded
hands
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Epanchin
rang
the
bell
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ask
Gavrila
Ardalionovitch
to
step
this
way
,
''
said
she
to
the
man
who
*NL*
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma
!
''
cried
Alexandra
,
significantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
just
say
two
words
to
him
,
that
's
all
,
''
said
her
mother
,
*NL*
silencing
all
objection
by
her
manner
;
she
was
evidently
seriously
put
*NL*
out
.
``
You
see
,
prince
,
it
is
all
secrets
with
us
,
just
now
--
all
secrets
.
*NL*
It
seems
to
be
the
etiquette
of
the
house
,
for
some
reason
or
other
.
*NL*
Stupid
nonsense
,
and
in
a
matter
which
ought
to
be
approached
with
all
*NL*
candour
and
open-heartedness
.
There
is
a
marriage
being
talked
of
,
and
I
*NL*
do
n't
like
this
marriage
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma
,
what
are
you
saying
?
''
said
Alexandra
again
,
hurriedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
,
my
dear
girl
?
As
if
you
can
possibly
like
it
yourself
?
The
*NL*
heart
is
the
great
thing
,
and
the
rest
is
all
rubbish
--
though
one
must
*NL*
have
sense
as
well
.
Perhaps
sense
is
really
the
great
thing
.
Do
n't
smile
*NL*
like
that
,
Aglaya
.
I
do
n't
contradict
myself
.
A
fool
with
a
heart
and
no
*NL*
brains
is
just
as
unhappy
as
a
fool
with
brains
and
no
heart
.
I
am
one
*NL*
and
you
are
the
other
,
and
therefore
both
of
us
suffer
,
both
of
us
are
*NL*
unhappy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
are
you
so
unhappy
,
mother
?
''
asked
Adelaida
,
who
alone
of
all
the
*NL*
company
seemed
to
have
preserved
her
good
temper
and
spirits
up
to
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
first
place
,
because
of
my
carefully
brought-up
daughters
,
''
said
*NL*
Mrs.
Epanchin
,
cuttingly
;
``
and
as
that
is
the
best
reason
I
can
give
you
*NL*
we
need
not
bother
about
any
other
at
present
.
Enough
of
words
,
now
!
*NL*
We
shall
see
how
both
of
you
-LRB-
I
do
n't
count
Aglaya
-RRB-
will
manage
your
*NL*
business
,
and
whether
you
,
most
revered
Alexandra
Ivanovna
,
will
be
*NL*
happy
with
your
fine
mate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
she
added
,
as
Gania
suddenly
entered
the
room
,
``
here
's
another
*NL*
marrying
subject
.
How
do
you
do
?
''
she
continued
,
in
response
to
Gania
's
*NL*
bow
;
but
she
did
not
invite
him
to
sit
down
.
``
You
are
going
to
be
*NL*
married
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Married
?
how
--
what
marriage
?
''
murmured
Gania
,
overwhelmed
with
*NL*
confusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
about
to
take
a
wife
?
I
ask
,
--
if
you
prefer
that
expression
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
I
--
I
--
no
!
''
said
Gania
,
bringing
out
his
lie
with
a
tell-tale
*NL*
blush
of
shame
.
He
glanced
keenly
at
Aglaya
,
who
was
sitting
some
way
*NL*
off
,
and
dropped
his
eyes
immediately
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aglaya
gazed
coldly
,
intently
,
and
composedly
at
him
,
without
taking
her
*NL*
eyes
off
his
face
,
and
watched
his
confusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
?
You
say
no
,
do
you
?
''
continued
the
pitiless
Mrs.
General
.
``
Very
*NL*
well
,
I
shall
remember
that
you
told
me
this
Wednesday
morning
,
in
*NL*
answer
to
my
question
,
that
you
are
not
going
to
be
married

What
day
is
*NL*
it
,
Wednesday
,
is
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

I
think
so
!

said
Adelaida
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
never
know
the
day
of
the
week

what
's
the
day
of
the
month

*NL*
*NL*
``
Twenty-seventh

said
Gania
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Twenty-seventh

very
well

Good-bye
now

you
have
a
good
deal
to

sure

I
must
dress

go
out

*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Epanchin
left
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gania
--
confused
,
annoyed
,
furious
--
took
up
his
portrait
,
and
turned
to
*NL*
the
prince
with
a
nasty
smile
on
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Prince

''
he
said
,
``
I
am
just
going
home

If

you

rising
from

She
left

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

said
Adelaida
,
``
I

She
*NL*
pressed
the
prince
's
hand
warmly
,
and
gave
him
a
friendly
smile
as
she
*NL*
left
the
room

She
did
not
so
much
as
look
at
Gania
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
your
doing

said
Gania
,
turning
on
the
latter
so
soon
*NL*
as
the
others
were
all
out
of
the
room
.
``
This
is
your
doing

sir
!

You

*NL*
have
been
telling
them
that
I
am
going

He
said
this
in
*NL*
a
hurried
whisper
,
his
eyes
flashing
with
rage
and
his
face
ablaze
.
``
You

shameless
tattler

*NL*
*NL*

I

calmly

politely

I

know

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
heard

you
went

blurted
it
out

lie

Devil
take
it

impatiently

But
at
this
moment
Aglaya
came
back

had
no

reply

*NL*
``

Conversing
with
the
prince
,
Aglaya
did
not
even
seem
to
notice
that
*NL*
Gania
was
in
the
room
.
But
while
the
prince
was
getting
his
pen
ready
,
*NL*
finding
a
page
,
and
making
his
preparations
to
write
,
Gania
came
up
to
*NL*
the
fireplace
where
Aglaya
was
standing
,
to
the
right
of
the
prince
,
and
*NL*
in
trembling
,
broken
accents
said
,
almost
in
her
ear
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
word
,
just
one
word
from
you
,
and
I
'm
saved
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
turned
sharply
round
and
looked
at
both
of
them
.
Gania
's
*NL*
face
was
full
of
real
despair
;
he
seemed
to
have
said
the
words
almost
*NL*
unconsciously
and
on
the
impulse
of
the
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aglaya
gazed
at
him
for
some
seconds
with
precisely
the
same
composure
*NL*
and
calm
astonishment
as
she
had
shown
a
little
while
before
,
when
the
*NL*
prince
handed
her
the
note
,
and
it
appeared
that
this
calm
surprise
and
*NL*
seemingly
absolute
incomprehension
of
what
was
said
to
her
,
were
more
*NL*
terribly
overwhelming
to
Gania
than
even
the
most
plainly
expressed
*NL*
disdain
would
have
been
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
shall
I
write
?
''
asked
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
dictate
to
you
,
''
said
Aglaya
,
coming
up
to
the
table
.
``
Now
then
,
*NL*
are
you
ready
?
Write
,
'
I
never
condescend
to
bargain
!
'
Now
put
your
name
*NL*
and
the
date
.
Let
me
see
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
handed
her
the
album
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Capital
!
How
beautifully
you
have
written
it
!
Thanks
so
much
.
_
Au
*NL*
revoir
_
,
prince
.
Wait
a
minute
,
''
;
she
added
,
``
I
want
to
give
you
*NL*
something
for
a
keepsake
.
Come
with
me
this
way
,
will
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
followed
her
.
Arrived
at
the
dining-room
,
she
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Read
this
,
''
she
said
,
handing
him
Gania
's
note
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
took
it
from
her
hand
,
but
gazed
at
her
in
bewilderment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
I
_
know
_
you
have
n't
read
it
,
and
that
you
could
never
be
that
*NL*
man
's
accomplice
.
Read
it
,
I
wish
you
to
read
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
letter
had
evidently
been
written
in
a
hurry
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
fate
is
to
be
decided
today
''
-LRB-
it
ran
-RRB-
,
``
you
know
how
.
This
day
I
*NL*
must
give
my
word
irrevocably
.
I
have
no
right
to
ask
your
help
,
and
I
*NL*
dare
not
allow
myself
to
indulge
in
any
hopes
;
but
once
you
said
just
*NL*
one
word
,
and
that
word
lighted
up
the
night
of
my
life
,
and
became
the
*NL*
beacon
of
my
days
.
Say
one
more
such
word
,
and
save
me
from
utter
ruin
.
*NL*
Only
tell
me
,
`
break
off
the
whole
thing
!
'
and
I
will
do
so
this
very
*NL*
day
.
Oh
!
what
can
it
cost
you
to
say
just
this
one
word
?
In
doing
so
you
*NL*
will
but
be
giving
me
a
sign
of
your
sympathy
for
me
,
and
of
your
pity
;
*NL*
only
this
,
only
this
;
nothing
more
,
_
nothing
_
.
I
dare
not
indulge
in
any
*NL*
hope
,
because
I
am
unworthy
of
it
.
But
if
you
say
but
this
word
,
I
will
*NL*
take
up
my
cross
again
with
joy
,
and
return
once
more
to
my
battle
with
*NL*
poverty
.
I
shall
meet
the
storm
and
be
glad
of
it
;
I
shall
rise
up
with
*NL*
renewed
strength
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Send
me
back
then
this
one
word
of
sympathy
,
only
sympathy
,
I
swear
*NL*
to
you
;
and
oh
!
do
not
be
angry
with
the
audacity
of
despair
,
with
the
*NL*
drowning
man
who
has
dared
to
make
this
last
effort
to
save
himself
from
*NL*
perishing
beneath
the
waters
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
G.L.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
man
assures
me
,
''
said
Aglaya
,
scornfully
,
when
the
prince
had
*NL*
finished
reading
the
letter
,
``
that
the
words
`
break
off
everything
'
*NL*
do
not
commit
me
to
anything
whatever
;
and
himself
gives
me
a
written
*NL*
guarantee
to
that
effect
,
in
this
letter
.
Observe
how
ingenuously
he
*NL*
underlines
certain
words
,
and
how
crudely
he
glosses
over
his
hidden
*NL*
thoughts
.
He
must
know
that
if
he
`
broke
off
everything
,
'
_
first
_
,
by
*NL*
himself
,
and
without
telling
me
a
word
about
it
or
having
the
slightest
*NL*
hope
on
my
account
,
that
in
that
case
I
should
perhaps
be
able
to
change
*NL*
my
opinion
of
him
,
and
even
accept
his
--
friendship
.
He
must
know
that
,
*NL*
but
his
soul
is
such
a
wretched
thing
.
He
knows
it
and
can
not
make
*NL*
up
his
mind
;
he
knows
it
and
yet
asks
for
guarantees
.
He
can
not
bring
*NL*
himself
to
_
trust
_
,
he
wants
me
to
give
him
hopes
of
myself
before
he
lets
*NL*
go
of
his
hundred
thousand
roubles
.
As
to
the
`
former
word
'
which
he
*NL*
declares
`
lighted
up
the
night
of
his
life
,
'
he
is
simply
an
impudent
*NL*
liar
;
I
merely
pitied
him
once
.
But
he
is
audacious
and
shameless
.
He
*NL*
immediately
began
to
hope
,
at
that
very
moment
.
I
saw
it
.
He
has
tried
*NL*
to
catch
me
ever
since
;
he
is
still
fishing
for
me
.
Well
,
enough
of
*NL*
this
.
Take
the
letter
and
give
it
back
to
him
,
as
soon
as
you
have
left
*NL*
our
house
;
not
before
,
of
course
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
shall
I
tell
him
by
way
of
answer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
--
of
course
!
That
's
the
best
answer
.
Is
it
the
case
that
you
are
*NL*
going
to
live
in
his
house
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
your
father
kindly
recommended
me
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
look
out
for
him
,
I
warn
you
!
He
wo
n't
forgive
you
easily
,
for
*NL*
taking
back
the
letter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Aglaya
pressed
the
prince
's
hand
and
left
the
room
.
Her
face
was
serious
*NL*
and
frowning
;
she
did
not
even
smile
as
she
nodded
good-bye
to
him
at
*NL*
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
just
get
my
parcel
and
we
'll
go
,
''
said
the
prince
to
Gania
,
as
he
*NL*
re-entered
the
drawing-room
.
Gania
stamped
his
foot
with
impatience
.
His
*NL*
face
looked
dark
and
gloomy
with
rage
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
they
left
the
house
behind
them
,
the
prince
carrying
his
bundle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
answer
--
quick
--
the
answer
!
''
said
Gania
,
the
instant
they
were
*NL*
outside
.
``
What
did
she
say
?
Did
you
give
the
letter
?
''
The
prince
*NL*
silently
held
out
the
note
.
Gania
was
struck
motionless
with
amazement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
,
what
?
my
letter
?
''
he
cried
.
``
He
never
delivered
it
!
I
might
have
*NL*
guessed
it
,
oh
!
curse
him
!
Of
course
she
did
not
understand
what
I
*NL*
meant
,
naturally
!
Why
--
why
--
_
why
_
did
n't
you
give
her
the
note
,
you
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
;
I
was
able
to
deliver
it
almost
immediately
after
receiving
*NL*
your
commission
,
and
I
gave
it
,
too
,
just
as
you
asked
me
to
.
It
has
*NL*
come
into
my
hands
now
because
Aglaya
Ivanovna
has
just
returned
it
to
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
?
When
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
soon
as
I
finished
writing
in
her
album
for
her
,
and
when
she
asked
*NL*
me
to
come
out
of
the
room
with
her
-LRB-
you
heard
?
-RRB-
,
we
went
into
the
*NL*
dining-room
,
and
she
gave
me
your
letter
to
read
,
and
then
told
me
to
*NL*
return
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
_
read
?
_
''
cried
Gania
,
almost
at
the
top
of
his
voice
;
``
to
_
read
_
,
*NL*
and
you
read
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
again
he
stood
like
a
log
in
the
middle
of
the
pavement
;
so
amazed
*NL*
that
his
mouth
remained
open
after
the
last
word
had
left
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
have
just
read
it

*NL*
*NL*

she
gave
it
you
to
read
herself

_
herself

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
herself
;
and
you
may
believe
me
when
I
tell
you
that
I
would
not
*NL*
have
read
it
for
anything
without
her
permission
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gania
was
silent
for
a
minute
or
two
,
as
though
thinking
out
some
*NL*
problem
.
Suddenly
he
cried
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
impossible
,
she
can
not
have
given
it
to
you
to
read

You
are
*NL*
lying
.
You
read
it
yourself
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
telling
you
the
truth
,
''
said
the
prince
in
his
former
composed
*NL*
tone
of
voice
;
``
and
believe
me
,
I
am
extremely
sorry
that
the
*NL*
circumstance
should
have
made
such
an
unpleasant
impression
upon
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
you
wretched
man
,
at
least
she
must
have
said
something
?
There
*NL*
must
be
_
some
_
answer
from
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
of
course
,
she
did
say
something
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Out
with
it
then
,
damn
it
!
Out
with
it
at
once
!
''
and
Gania
stamped
his
*NL*
foot
twice
on
the
pavement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
soon
as
I
had
finished
reading
it
,
she
told
me
that
you
were
fishing
*NL*
for
her
;
that
you
wished
to
compromise
her
so
far
as
to
receive
some
*NL*
hopes
from
her
,
trusting
to
which
hopes
you
might
break
with
the
*NL*
prospect
of
receiving
a
hundred
thousand
roubles
.
She
said
that
if
you
*NL*
had
done
this
without
bargaining
with
her
,
if
you
had
broken
with
the
*NL*
money
prospects
without
trying
to
force
a
guarantee
out
of
her
first
,
*NL*
she
might
have
been
your
friend
.
That
's
all
,
I
think
.
Oh
no
,
when
I
*NL*
asked
her
what
I
was
to
say
,
as
I
took
the
letter
,
she
replied
that
`
no
*NL*
answer
is
the
best
answer
.
'
I
think
that
was
it
.
Forgive
me
if
I
do
*NL*
not
use
her
exact
expressions
.
I
tell
you
the
sense
as
I
understood
it
*NL*
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ungovernable
rage
and
madness
took
entire
possession
of
Gania
,
and
his
*NL*
fury
burst
out
without
the
least
attempt
at
restraint
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
that
's
it
,
is
it
!
''
he
yelled
.
``
She
throws
my
letters
out
of
the
*NL*
window
,
does
she
!
Oh
!
and
she
does
not
condescend
to
bargain
,
while
I
*NL*
_
do
_
,
eh

We
shall
see
,
we
shall
see
!
I
shall
pay
her
out
for
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
twisted
himself
about
with
rage
,
and
grew
paler
and
paler
;
he
shook
*NL*
his
fist
.
So
the
pair
walked
along
a
few
steps
.
Gania
did
not
stand
on
*NL*
ceremony
with
the
prince
;
he
behaved
just
as
though
he
were
alone
in
*NL*
his
room
.
He
clearly
counted
the
latter
as
a
nonentity
.
But
suddenly
he
*NL*
seemed
to
have
an
idea
,
and
recollected
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
was
it
?
''
he
asked
,
``
how
was
it
that
you
-LRB-
idiot
that
you
are
-RRB-
,
''
*NL*
he
added
to
himself
,
``
were
so
very
confidential
a
couple
of
hours
after
*NL*
your
first
meeting
with
these
people
?
How
was
that

eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Up
to
this
moment
jealousy
had
not
been
one
of
his
torments
;
now
it
*NL*
suddenly
gnawed
at
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
a
thing
I
can
not
undertake
to
explain
,
''
replied
the
prince
.
*NL*
Gania
looked
at
him
with
angry
contempt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
I
suppose
the
present
she
wished
to
make
to
you
,
when
she
took
you
*NL*
into
the
dining-room
,
was
her
confidence
,
eh

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
that
was
it
;
I
can
not
explain
it
otherwise

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why

_
why

Devil
take
it

what
did
you
do
in
there

Why
did
they
*NL*
fancy
you
?
Look
here
,
ca
n't
you
remember
exactly
what
you
said
to
them
,
*NL*
from
the
very
beginning
?
Ca
n't
you
remember
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
we
talked
of
a
great
many
things

When
first
I
went
in
we
began
to
*NL*
speak
of
Switzerland

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

the
devil
take
Switzerland

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
about
executions

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Executions
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
at
least
about
one

Then
I
told
the
whole
three
years

story
of
my
*NL*
life
,
and
the
history
of
a
poor
peasant
girl
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
damn
the
peasant
girl

go
on

on

Gania

impatiently

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
how
Schneider
told
me
about
my
childish
nature

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

curse

Schneider

his
dirty
opinions

on

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
began
to
talk
about
faces
,
at
least
about
the
_
expressions

of
*NL*
faces
,
and
said
that
Aglaya
Ivanovna
was
nearly
as
lovely
as
Nastasia
*NL*
Philipovna

It
was
then
I
blurted
out
about
the
portrait

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
did
n't
repeat
what
you
heard
in

study

that

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

_
not
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
how
did
they
--
look
here
!
Did
Aglaya
show
my
letter
to
the
old
*NL*
lady
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
there
I
can
give
you
my
fullest
assurance
that
she
did
_
not
_
.
I
was
*NL*
there
all
the
while
--
she
had
no
time
to
do
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
perhaps
you
may
not
have
observed
it
,
oh
,
you
damned
idiot
,
you
!
''
*NL*
he
shouted
,
quite
beside
himself
with
fury
.
``
You
ca
n't
even
describe
*NL*
what
went
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gania
having
once
descended
to
abuse
,
and
receiving
no
check
,
very
soon
*NL*
knew
no
bounds
or
limit
to
his
licence
,
as
is
often
the
way
in
such
*NL*
cases
.
His
rage
so
blinded
him
that
he
had
not
even
been
able
to
detect
*NL*
that
this
``
idiot
,
''
whom
he
was
abusing
to
such
an
extent
,
was
very
*NL*
far
from
being
slow
of
comprehension
,
and
had
a
way
of
taking
in
*NL*
an
impression
,
and
afterwards
giving
it
out
again
,
which
was
very
*NL*
un-idiotic
indeed
.
But
something
a
little
unforeseen
now
occurred
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
ought
to
tell
you
,
Gavrila
Ardalionovitch
,
''
said
the
prince
,
*NL*
suddenly
,
``
that
though
I
once
was
so
ill
that
I
really
was
little
better
*NL*
than
an
idiot
,
yet
now
I
am
almost
recovered
,
and
that
,
therefore
,
it
is
*NL*
not
altogether
pleasant
to
be
called
an
idiot
to
my
face
.
Of
course
your
*NL*
anger
is
excusable
,
considering
the
treatment
you
have
just
experienced
;
*NL*
but
I
must
remind
you
that
you
have
twice
abused
me
rather
rudely
.
I
*NL*
do
not
like
this
sort
of
thing
,
and
especially
so
at
the
first
time
*NL*
of
meeting
a
man
,
and
,
therefore
,
as
we
happen
to
be
at
this
moment
*NL*
standing
at
a
crossroad
,
do
n't
you
think
we
had
better
part
,
you
to
the
*NL*
left
,
homewards
,
and
I
to
the
right
,
here
?
I
have
twenty-five
roubles
,
*NL*
and
I
shall
easily
find
a
lodging
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gania
was
much
confused
,
and
blushed
for
shame
``
Do
forgive
me
,
prince
!
''
*NL*
he
cried
,
suddenly
changing
his
abusive
tone
for
one
of
great
courtesy
.
*NL*
``
For
Heaven
's
sake
,
forgive
me
!
You
see
what
a
miserable
plight
I
am
*NL*
in
,
but
you
hardly
know
anything
of
the
facts
of
the
case
as
yet
.
If
you
*NL*
did
,
I
am
sure
you
would
forgive
me
,
at
least
partially
.
Of
course
it
*NL*
was
inexcusable
of
me
,
I
know
,
but
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dear
me
,
I
really
do
not
require
such
profuse
apologies
,
''
replied
*NL*
the
prince
,
hastily
.
``
I
quite
understand
how
unpleasant
your
position
*NL*
is
,
and
that
is
what
made
you
abuse
me
.
So
come
along
to
your
house
,
*NL*
after
all
.
I
shall
be
delighted
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
going
to
let
him
go
like
this
,
''
thought
Gania
,
glancing
*NL*
angrily
at
the
prince
as
they
walked
along
.
``
The
fellow
has
sucked
*NL*
everything
out
of
me
,
and
now
he
takes
off
his
mask
--
there
's
something
*NL*
more
than
appears
,
here
we
shall
see
.
It
shall
all
be
as
clear
as
water
*NL*
by
tonight
,
everything
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
by
this
time
they
had
reached
Gania
's
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
VIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
flat
occupied
by
Gania
and
his
family
was
on
the
third
floor
of
the
*NL*
house
.
It
was
reached
by
a
clean
light
staircase
,
and
consisted
of
seven
*NL*
rooms
,
a
nice
enough
lodging
,
and
one
would
have
thought
a
little
too
*NL*
good
for
a
clerk
on
two
thousand
roubles
a
year
.
But
it
was
designed
*NL*
to
accommodate
a
few
lodgers
on
board
terms
,
and
had
been
taken
a
few
*NL*
months
since
,
much
to
the
disgust
of
Gania
,
at
the
urgent
request
of
his
*NL*
mother
and
his
sister
,
Varvara
Ardalionovna
,
who
longed
to
do
something
*NL*
to
increase
the
family
income
a
little
,
and
fixed
their
hopes
upon
*NL*
letting
lodgings
.
Gania
frowned
upon
the
idea
.
He
thought
it
_
infra
dig
_
,
*NL*
and
did
not
quite
like
appearing
in
society
afterwards
--
that
society
in
*NL*
which
he
had
been
accustomed
to
pose
up
to
now
as
a
young
man
of
rather
*NL*
brilliant
prospects
.
All
these
concessions
and
rebuffs
of
fortune
,
*NL*
of
late
,
had
wounded
his
spirit
severely
,
and
his
temper
had
become
*NL*
extremely
irritable
,
his
wrath
being
generally
quite
out
of
proportion
*NL*
to
the
cause
.
But
if
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
put
up
with
this
sort
of
*NL*
life
for
a
while
,
it
was
only
on
the
plain
understanding
with
his
inner
*NL*
self
that
he
would
very
soon
change
it
all
,
and
have
things
as
he
*NL*
chose
again
.
Yet
the
very
means
by
which
he
hoped
to
make
this
change
*NL*
threatened
to
involve
him
in
even
greater
difficulties
than
he
had
had
*NL*
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
flat
was
divided
by
a
passage
which
led
straight
out
of
the
*NL*
entrance-hall
.
Along
one
side
of
this
corridor
lay
the
three
rooms
which
*NL*
were
designed
for
the
accommodation
of
the
``
highly
recommended
''
lodgers
.
*NL*
Besides
these
three
rooms
there
was
another
small
one
at
the
end
of
the
*NL*
passage
,
close
to
the
kitchen
,
which
was
allotted
to
General
Ivolgin
,
*NL*
the
nominal
master
of
the
house
,
who
slept
on
a
wide
sofa
,
and
was
*NL*
obliged
to
pass
into
and
out
of
his
room
through
the
kitchen
,
and
up
*NL*
or
down
the
back
stairs
.
Colia
,
Gania
's
young
brother
,
a
school-boy
of
*NL*
thirteen
,
shared
this
room
with
his
father
.
He
,
too
,
had
to
sleep
on
*NL*
an
old
sofa
,
a
narrow
,
uncomfortable
thing
with
a
torn
rug
over
it
;
his
*NL*
chief
duty
being
to
look
after
his
father
,
who
needed
to
be
watched
more
*NL*
and
more
every
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
was
given
the
middle
room
of
the
three
,
the
first
being
*NL*
occupied
by
one
Ferdishenko
,
while
the
third
was
empty
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Gania
first
conducted
the
prince
to
the
family
apartments
.
These
*NL*
consisted
of
a
``
salon
,
''
which
became
the
dining-room
when
required
;
a
*NL*
drawing-room
,
which
was
only
a
drawing-room
in
the
morning
,
and
became
*NL*
Gania
's
study
in
the
evening
,
and
his
bedroom
at
night
;
and
lastly
Nina
*NL*
Alexandrovna
's
and
Varvara
's
bedroom
,
a
small
,
close
chamber
which
they
*NL*
shared
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
word
,
the
whole
place
was
confined
,
and
a
``
tight
fit
''
for
the
*NL*
party
.
Gania
used
to
grind
his
teeth
with
rage
over
the
state
of
*NL*
affairs
;
though
he
was
anxious
to
be
dutiful
and
polite
to
his
mother
.
*NL*
However
,
it
was
very
soon
apparent
to
anyone
coming
into
the
house
,
that
*NL*
Gania
was
the
tyrant
of
the
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nina
Alexandrovna
and
her
daughter
were
both
seated
in
the
drawing-room
,
*NL*
engaged
in
knitting
,
and
talking
to
a
visitor
,
Ivan
Petrovitch
Ptitsin
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lady
of
the
house
appeared
to
be
a
woman
of
about
fifty
years
of
*NL*
age
,
thin-faced
,
and
with
black
lines
under
the
eyes
.
She
looked
ill
and
*NL*
rather
sad
;
but
her
face
was
a
pleasant
one
for
all
that
;
and
from
the
*NL*
first
word
that
fell
from
her
lips
,
any
stranger
would
at
once
conclude
*NL*
that
she
was
of
a
serious
and
particularly
sincere
nature
.
In
spite
of
*NL*
her
sorrowful
expression
,
she
gave
the
idea
of
possessing
considerable
*NL*
firmness
and
decision
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
dress
was
modest
and
simple
to
a
degree
,
dark
and
elderly
in
style
;
*NL*
but
both
her
face
and
appearance
gave
evidence
that
she
had
seen
better
*NL*
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
Varvara
was
a
girl
of
some
twenty-three
summers
,
of
middle
height
,
thin
,
*NL*
but
possessing
a
face
which
,
without
being
actually
beautiful
,
had
*NL*
the
rare
quality
of
charm
,
and
might
fascinate
even
to
the
extent
of
*NL*
passionate
regard
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
very
like
her
mother
:
she
even
dressed
like
her
,
which
proved
*NL*
that
she
had
no
taste
for
smart
clothes
.
The
expression
of
her
grey
eyes
*NL*
was
merry
and
gentle
,
when
it
was
not
,
as
lately
,
too
full
of
thought
*NL*
and
anxiety
.
The
same
decision
and
firmness
was
to
be
observed
in
her
*NL*
face
as
in
her
mother
's
,
but
her
strength
seemed
to
be
more
vigorous
*NL*
than
that
of
Nina
Alexandrovna
.
She
was
subject
to
outbursts
of
temper
,
*NL*
of
which
even
her
brother
was
a
little
afraid
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
present
visitor
,
Ptitsin
,
was
also
afraid
of
her
.
This
was
a
young
*NL*
fellow
of
something
under
thirty
,
dressed
plainly
,
but
neatly
.
His
*NL*
manners
were
good
,
but
rather
ponderously
so
.
His
dark
beard
bore
*NL*
evidence
to
the
fact
that
he
was
not
in
any
government
employ
.
He
could
*NL*
speak
well
,
but
preferred
silence
.
On
the
whole
he
made
a
decidedly
*NL*
agreeable
impression
.
He
was
clearly
attracted
by
Varvara
,
and
made
no
*NL*
secret
of
his
feelings
.
She
trusted
him
in
a
friendly
way
,
but
had
not
*NL*
shown
him
any
decided
encouragement
as
yet
,
which
fact
did
not
quell
his
*NL*
ardour
in
the
least
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nina
Alexandrovna
was
very
fond
of
him
,
and
had
grown
quite
confidential
*NL*
with
him
of
late
.
Ptitsin
,
as
was
well
known
,
was
engaged
in
the
*NL*
business
of
lending
out
money
on
good
security
,
and
at
a
good
rate
of
*NL*
interest
.
He
was
a
great
friend
of
Gania
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
formal
introduction
by
Gania
-LRB-
who
greeted
his
mother
very
*NL*
shortly
,
took
no
notice
of
his
sister
,
and
immediately
marched
Ptitsin
*NL*
out
of
the
room
-RRB-
,
Nina
Alexandrovna
addressed
a
few
kind
words
to
the
*NL*
prince
and
forthwith
requested
Colia
,
who
had
just
appeared
at
the
door
,
*NL*
to
show
him
to
the
``
middle
room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Colia
was
a
nice-looking
boy
.
His
expression
was
simple
and
confiding
,
*NL*
and
his
manners
were
very
polite
and
engaging
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
's
your
luggage
?
''
he
asked
,
as
he
led
the
prince
away
to
his
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
a
bundle
;
it
's
in
the
entrance
hall
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
bring
it
you
directly
.
We
only
have
a
cook
and
one
maid
,
so
I
have
*NL*
to
help
as
much
as
I
can
.
Varia
looks
after
things
,
generally
,
and
*NL*
loses
her
temper
over
it
.
Gania
says
you
have
only
just
arrived
from
*NL*
Switzerland
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
jolly
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mountains
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
go
and
get
your
bundle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Varvara
joined
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
maid
shall
bring
your
bed-linen
directly
.
Have
you
a
portmanteau
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
a
bundle
--
your
brother
has
just
gone
to
the
hall
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
nothing
there
except
this
,
''
said
Colia
,
returning
at
this
*NL*
moment
.
``
Where
did
you
put
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
but
that
's
all
I
have
,
''
said
the
prince
,
taking
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
I
thought
perhaps
Ferdishenko
had
taken
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
talk
nonsense
,
''
said
Varia
,
severely
.
She
seemed
put
out
,
and
was
*NL*
only
just
polite
with
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oho
!
''
laughed
the
boy
,
``
you
can
be
nicer
than
that
to
_
me
_
,
you
know
--
I
'm
*NL*
not
Ptitsin

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ought
to
be
whipped
,
Colia
,
you
silly
boy
.
If
you
want
anything
''
*NL*
-LRB-
to
the
prince
-RRB-
``
please
apply
to
the
servant
.
We
dine
at
half-past
four
.
*NL*
You
can
take
your
dinner
with
us
,
or
have
it
in
your
room
,
just
as
you
*NL*
please
.
Come
along
,
Colia
,
do
n't
disturb
the
prince
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
door
they
met
Gania
coming
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
father
in
?
''
he
asked
.
Colia
whispered
something
in
his
ear
and
went
*NL*
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
a
couple
of
words
,
prince
,
if
you
'll
excuse
me

Do
n't
blab
over

_
there

about
what
you
may
see
here
,
or
in
this
house
as
to
all
that
about
*NL*
Aglaya

me

you
know

Things
are
not
altogether
pleasant
in

establishment

You
'll
see

At
all

keep
your

yourself

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
assure
you
I
`
blabbed
'
a
great
deal
less
than
you
seem
to
suppose

''
*NL*
said
the
prince
,
with
some
annoyance
.
Clearly
the
relations
between
*NL*
Gania
and
himself
were
by
no
means
improving
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
I
well

I
caught
it

hot
enough

you

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
might
fairly
remember
that
I
was
not
in
any
way
bound

I
*NL*
had
no
reason

be
silent
about
that
portrait

You
never
asked

``
Pfu
!
what
a
wretched
room
this
is
--
dark
,
and
the
window
looking
*NL*
into
the
yard
.
Your
coming
to
our
house
is
,
in
no
respect
,
opportune
.
*NL*
However
,
it
's
not
_
my

I
do

the

''
*NL*
*NL*
Ptitsin
here
looked
in
and
beckoned
to
Gania
,
who
hastily
left
the
room
,
*NL*
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
had
evidently
wished
to
say
something
more
*NL*
and
had
only
made
the
remark
about
the
room
to
gain
time
.
The
prince
had
*NL*
hardly
had
time
to
wash
and
tidy
himself
a
little
when
the
door
opened
*NL*
once
more
,
and
another
figure
appeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
gentleman
of
about
thirty
,
tall
,
broad-shouldered
,
and
*NL*
red-haired
;
his
face
was
red
,
too
,
and
he
possessed
a
pair
of
thick
*NL*
lips
,
a
wide
nose
,
small
eyes
,
rather
bloodshot
,
and
with
an
ironical
*NL*
expression
in
them
;
as
though
he
were
perpetually
winking
at
someone
.
*NL*
His
whole
appearance
gave
one
the
idea
of
impudence
;
his
dress
was
*NL*
shabby
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
opened
the
door
just
enough
to
let
his
head
in
.
His
head
remained
so
*NL*
placed
for
a
few
seconds
while
he
quietly
scrutinized
the
room
;
the
door
*NL*
then
opened
enough
to
admit
his
body
;
but
still
he
did
not
enter
.
He
*NL*
stood
on
the
threshold
and
examined
the
prince
carefully
.
At
last
he
*NL*
gave
the
door
a
final
shove
,
entered
,
approached
the
prince
,
took
his
*NL*
hand
and
seated
himself
and
the
owner
of
the
room
on
two
chairs
side
by
*NL*
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ferdishenko
,
''
he
said
,
gazing
intently
and
inquiringly
into
the
*NL*
prince
's
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
what
next
?
''
said
the
latter
,
almost
laughing
in
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
lodger
here
,
''
continued
the
other
,
staring
as
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
wish
to
make
acquaintance
?
''
asked
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
the
visitor
,
passing
his
fingers
through
his
hair
and
*NL*
sighing
.
He
then
looked
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
and
around
*NL*
it
.
``
Got
any
money
?
''
he
asked
,
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Twenty-five
roubles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
see
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
took
his
banknote
out
and
showed
it
to
Ferdishenko
.
The
*NL*
latter
unfolded
it
and
looked
at
it
;
then
he
turned
it
round
and
*NL*
examined
the
other
side
;
then
he
held
it
up
to
the
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
strange
that
it
should
have
browned
so
,
''
he
said
,
reflectively
.
*NL*
``
These
twenty-five
rouble
notes
brown
in
a
most
extraordinary
way
,
while
*NL*
other
notes
often
grow
paler
.
Take
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
took
his
note
.
Ferdishenko
rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
came
here
to
warn
you
,
''
he
said
.
``
In
the
first
place
,
do
n't
lend
me
*NL*
any
money
,
for
I
shall
certainly
ask
you
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
you
pay
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
intend
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
I
_
do
n't
_
intend
to

Thanks
.
I
live
here
,
next
door
to
you
;
you
*NL*
noticed
a
room
,
did
you
?
Do
n't
come
to
me
very
often
;
I
shall
see
you
*NL*
here
quite
often
enough
.
Have
you
seen
the
general
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
heard
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
of
course
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
'll
both
hear
and
see
him
soon
;
he
even
tries
to
borrow
money
*NL*
from
me
.
_
Avis
au
lecteur
.
_
Good-bye
;
do
you
think
a
man
can
possibly
*NL*
live
with
a
name
like
Ferdishenko
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
he
departed
.
The
prince
found
out
afterwards
that
this
gentleman
*NL*
made
it
his
business
to
amaze
people
with
his
originality
and
wit
,
but
*NL*
that
it
did
not
as
a
rule
``
come
off
.
''
He
even
produced
a
bad
impression
*NL*
on
some
people
,
which
grieved
him
sorely
;
but
he
did
not
change
his
ways
*NL*
for
all
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
went
out
of
the
prince
's
room
,
he
collided
with
yet
another
*NL*
visitor
coming
in
.
Ferdishenko
took
the
opportunity
of
making
several
*NL*
warning
gestures
to
the
prince
from
behind
the
new
arrival
's
back
,
and
*NL*
left
the
room
in
conscious
pride
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
next
arrival
was
a
tall
red-faced
man
of
about
fifty-five
,
with
*NL*
greyish
hair
and
whiskers
,
and
large
eyes
which
stood
out
of
their
*NL*
sockets
.
His
appearance
would
have
been
distinguished
had
it
not
been
*NL*
that
he
gave
the
idea
of
being
rather
dirty
.
He
was
dressed
in
an
old
*NL*
coat
,
and
he
smelled
of
vodka
when
he
came
near
.
His
walk
was
effective
,
*NL*
and
he
clearly
did
his
best
to
appear
dignified
,
and
to
impress
people
*NL*
by
his
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
gentleman
now
approached
the
prince
slowly
,
and
with
a
most
*NL*
courteous
smile
;
silently
took
his
hand
and
held
it
in
his
own
,
as
he
*NL*
examined
the
prince
's
features
as
though
searching
for
familiar
traits
*NL*
therein
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
he
,
't
is
he
!
''
he
said
at
last
,
quietly
,
but
with
much
solemnity
.
*NL*
``
As
though
he
were
alive
once
more
.
I
heard
the
familiar
name-the
*NL*
dear
familiar
name
--
and
,
oh
!
how
it
reminded
me
of
the
irrevocable
*NL*
past
--
Prince
Muishkin
,
I
believe
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
General
Ivolgin
--
retired
and
unfortunate
.
May
I
ask
your
Christian
and
*NL*
generic
names
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lef
Nicolaievitch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
so
--
the
son
of
my
old
,
I
may
say
my
childhood
's
friend
,
Nicolai
*NL*
Petrovitch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
father
's
name
was
Nicolai
Lvovitch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lvovitch
,
''
repeated
the
general
without
the
slightest
haste
,
and
with
*NL*
perfect
confidence
,
just
as
though
he
had
not
committed
himself
the
*NL*
least
in
the
world
,
but
merely
made
a
little
slip
of
the
tongue
.
He
sat
*NL*
down
,
and
taking
the
prince
's
hand
,
drew
him
to
a
seat
next
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
carried
you
in
my
arms
as
a
baby
,
''
he
observed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
?
''
asked
the
prince
.
``
Why
,
it
's
twenty
years
since
my
father
*NL*
died
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
--
twenty
years
and
three
months
.
We
were
educated
together
;
I
*NL*
went
straight
into
the
army
,
and
he
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
father
went
into
the
army

too

He
was
a
sub-lieutenant
in
the
*NL*
Vasiliefsky
regiment

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

sir

in
the
Bielomirsky
;
he
changed
into
the
latter
shortly
before
*NL*
his
death

I
was
at
his
bedside
when
he
died
,
and
gave
him
my
blessing
*NL*
for
eternity
.
Your
mother
--
''
The
general
paused
,
as
though
overcome
with
*NL*
emotion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
died
a
few
months
later
,
from
a
cold
,
''
said
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
not
cold
--
believe
an
old
man
--
not
from
a
cold
,
but
from
grief
for
*NL*
her
prince

Oh

your
mother

your
mother
!
heigh-ho
!
Youth
--
youth
!
Your
*NL*
father
and
I
--
old
friends
as
we
were
--
nearly
murdered
each
other
for
her
*NL*
sake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
began
to
be
a
little
incredulous
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
passionately
in
love
with
her
when
she
was
engaged
--
engaged
to
my
*NL*
friend
.
The
prince
noticed
the
fact
and
was
furious
.
He
came
and
woke
me
*NL*
at
seven
o'clock
one
morning
.
I
rise
and
dress
in
amazement
;
silence
on
*NL*
both
sides
.
I
understand
it
all
.
He
takes
a
couple
of
pistols
out
of
his
*NL*
pocket
--
across
a
handkerchief
--
without
witnesses
.
Why
invite
witnesses
*NL*
when
both
of
us
would
be
walking
in
eternity
in
a
couple
of
minutes
?
The
*NL*
pistols
are
loaded
;
we
stretch
the
handkerchief
and
stand
opposite
one
*NL*
another
.
We
aim
the
pistols
at
each
other
's
hearts
.
Suddenly
tears
start
*NL*
to
our
eyes
,
our
hands
shake
;
we
weep
,
we
embrace
--
the
battle
is
one
of
*NL*
self-sacrifice
now
!
The
prince
shouts
,
`
She
is
yours
;
'
I
cry
,
`
She
is
*NL*
yours
--
'
in
a
word
,
in
a
word
--
You
've
come
to
live
with
us
,
hey
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
yes
--
for
a
while
,
I
think
,
''
stammered
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Prince
,
mother
begs
you
to
come
to
her

''
said
Colia
,
appearing
at
the
*NL*
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
rose
to
go
,
but
the
general
once
more
laid
his
hand
in
a
*NL*
friendly
manner
on
his
shoulder
,
and
dragged
him
down
on
to
the
sofa
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
the
true
friend
of
your
father
,
I
wish
to
say
a
few
words
to
you

''
*NL*
he
began
.
``
I
have
suffered
--
there
was
a
catastrophe
.
I
suffered
without
*NL*
a
trial
;
I
had
no
trial

Nina
Alexandrovna
my
wife
,
is
an
excellent
*NL*
woman
,
so
is
my
daughter
Varvara
.
We
have
to
let
lodgings
because
we
are
*NL*
poor
--
a
dreadful
,
unheard-of
come-down
for
us
--
for
me
,
who
should
*NL*
have
been
a
governor-general
;
but
we
are
very
glad
to
have
_
you
_
,
at
all
*NL*
events
.
Meanwhile
there
is
a
tragedy
in
the
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
looked
inquiringly
at
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
a
marriage
is
being
arranged
--
a
marriage
between
a
questionable
*NL*
woman
and
a
young
fellow
who
might
be
a
flunkey
.
They
wish
to
bring
this
*NL*
woman
into
the
house
where
my
wife
and
daughter
reside
,
but
while
I
*NL*
live
and
breathe
she
shall
never
enter
my
doors
.
I
shall
lie
at
the
*NL*
threshold
,
and
she
shall
trample
me
underfoot
if
she
does
.
I
hardly
*NL*
talk
to
Gania
now
,
and
avoid
him
as
much
as
I
can
.
I
warn
you
of
this
*NL*
beforehand
,
but
you
can
not
fail
to
observe
it
.
But
you
are
the
son
of
my
*NL*
old
friend
,
and
I
hope

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Prince
,
be
so
kind
as
to
come
to
me
for
a
moment
in
the
drawing-room
,

*NL*
said
Nina
Alexandrovna
herself
,
appearing
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Imagine
,
my
dear
,
''
cried
the
general
,
``
it
turns
out
that
I
have
nursed
*NL*
the
prince
on
my
knee
in
the
old
days
.
''
His
wife
looked
searchingly
at
*NL*
him
,
and
glanced
at
the
prince
,
but
said
nothing
.
The
prince
rose
and
*NL*
followed
her
;
but
hardly
had
they
reached
the
drawing-room
,
and
Nina
*NL*
Alexandrovna
had
begun
to
talk
hurriedly
,
when
in
came
the
general
.
*NL*
She
immediately
relapsed
into
silence
.
The
master
of
the
house
may
have
*NL*
observed
this
,
but
at
all
events
he
did
not
take
any
notice
of
it
;
he
*NL*
was
in
high
good
humour
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
son
of
my
old
friend
,
dear

he
cried
;
``
surely
you
must
remember
*NL*
Prince
Nicolai
Lvovitch
?
You
saw
him
at

at
Tver

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
remember
any
Nicolai
Lvovitch

Was
that
your
father

she
*NL*
inquired
of
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

but
he
died
at
Elizabethgrad

not
at
Tver

said
the

rather
timidly
.
``
So
Pavlicheff
told
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

Tver

''
insisted
the
general
;
``
he
removed
just
before

You

*NL*
``
Oh

yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
My

just
about

said
the

I
never
knew

accused

He
died
in
hospital

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
it
was
the
Kolpakoff
business

have
been

acquitted

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

Do
you
know
that
for
a
fact

asked
the
prince
,
whose
curiosity
*NL*
was
aroused
by
the
general
's
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
so
indeed
!

cried
the
latter
.
``
The
court-martial
came
to
*NL*
no

business

!
*NL*
Captain
Larionoff

commander

the
company

had
died

his
command
*NL*
was
handed
over
to
the

for
the
moment

Very
well

This
soldier
,
*NL*
Kolpakoff
,
stole
some
leather
from
one
of
his
comrades

intending
to
*NL*
sell
it

and
spent
the
money
on
drink

Well

The
prince

you
understand

that
what
follows
took
place
in
the
presence
of
the
sergeant-major
,
and
*NL*
a
corporal
--
the
prince
rated
Kolpakoff
soundly
,
and
threatened
to
have
*NL*
him
flogged
.
Well
,
Kolpakoff
went
back
to
the
barracks
,
lay
down
on
*NL*
a
camp
bedstead
,
and
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
was
dead
:
you
quite
*NL*
understand
?
It
was
,
as
I
said
,
a
strange
,
almost
impossible
,
affair
.
*NL*
In
due
course
Kolpakoff
was
buried
;
the
prince
wrote
his
report
,
the
*NL*
deceased
's
name
was
removed
from
the
roll
.
All
as
it
should
be
,
is
it
*NL*
not
?
But
exactly
three
months
later
at
the
inspection
of
the
brigade
,
*NL*
the
man
Kolpakoff
was
found
in
the
third
company
of
the
second
battalion
*NL*
of
infantry
,
Novozemlianski
division
,
just
as
if
nothing
had
happened
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
said
the
prince
,
much
astonished
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
did
not
occur
--
it
's
a
mistake
!
''
said
Nina
Alexandrovna
quickly
,
*NL*
looking
,
at
the
prince
rather
anxiously
.
''
_
Mon
mari
se
trompe
_
,
''
she
*NL*
added
,
speaking
in
French
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
'
_
se
trompe
_
'
is
easily
said
.
Do
you
remember
any
case
at
all
*NL*
like
it
?
Everybody
was
at
their
wits
'
end
.
I
should
be
the
first
to
say
*NL*
'
_
qu'on
se
trompe
_
,
'
but
unfortunately
I
was
an
eye-witness
,
and
was
also
*NL*
on
the
commission
of
inquiry
.
Everything
proved
that
it
was
really
he
,
*NL*
the
very
same
soldier
Kolpakoff
who
had
been
given
the
usual
military
*NL*
funeral
to
the
sound
of
the
drum
.
It
is
of
course
a
most
curious
*NL*
case
--
nearly
an
impossible
one
.
I
recognize
that
...
but
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
,
your
dinner
is
ready
,
''
said
Varvara
at
this
point
,
putting
her
*NL*
head
in
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
glad
,
I
'm
particularly
hungry
.
Yes
,
yes
,
a
strange
*NL*
coincidence
--
almost
a
psychological
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
soup
'll
be
cold
;
do
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Coming
,
coming
,
''
said
the
general
.
``
Son
of
my
old
friend
--
''
he
was
*NL*
heard
muttering
as
he
went
down
the
passage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
have
to
excuse
very
much
in
my
husband
,
if
you
stay
with
us
,
''
*NL*
said
Nina
Alexandrovna
;
``
but
he
will
not
disturb
you
often
.
He
dines
*NL*
alone
.
Everyone
has
his
little
peculiarities
,
you
know
,
and
some
people
*NL*
perhaps
have
more
than
those
who
are
most
pointed
at
and
laughed
at
.
*NL*
One
thing
I
must
beg
of
you
--
if
my
husband
applies
to
you
for
payment
*NL*
for
board
and
lodging
,
tell
him
that
you
have
already
paid
me
.
Of
course
*NL*
anything
paid
by
you
to
the
general
would
be
as
fully
settled
as
if
*NL*
paid
to
me
,
so
far
as
you
are
concerned
;
but
I
wish
it
to
be
so
,
if
you
*NL*
please
,
for
convenience
'
sake
.
What
is
it
,
Varia
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Varia
had
quietly
entered
the
room
,
and
was
holding
out
the
portrait
of
*NL*
Nastasia
Philipovna
to
her
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nina
Alexandrovna
started
,
and
examined
the
photograph
intently
,
gazing
*NL*
at
it
long
and
sadly
.
At
last
she
looked
up
inquiringly
at
Varia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
present
from
herself
to
him
,
''
said
Varia
;
``
the
question
is
to
be
*NL*
finally
decided
this
evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
evening
!
''
repeated
her
mother
in
a
tone
of
despair
,
but
softly
,
*NL*
as
though
to
herself
.
``
Then
it
's
all
settled
,
of
course
,
and
there
's
no
*NL*
hope
left
to
us
.
She
has
anticipated
her
answer
by
the
present
of
her
*NL*
portrait
.
Did
he
show
it
you
himself
?
''
she
added
,
in
some
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
we
have
hardly
spoken
to
each
other
for
a
whole
month
.
Ptitsin
*NL*
told
me
all
about
it
;
and
the
photo
was
lying
under
the
table
,
and
I
*NL*
picked
it
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Prince
,
''
asked
Nina
Alexandrovna
,
``
I
wanted
to
inquire
whether
you
have
*NL*
known
my
son
long
?
I
think
he
said
that
you
had
only
arrived
today
from
*NL*
somewhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
gave
a
short
narrative
of
what
we
have
heard
before
,
leaving
*NL*
out
the
greater
part
.
The
two
ladies
listened
intently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
ask
about
Gania
out
of
curiosity
,
''
said
the
elder
,
at
last
.
*NL*
``
I
wish
to
know
how
much
you
know
about
him
,
because
he
said
just
now
*NL*
that
we
need
not
stand
on
ceremony
with
you
.
What
,
exactly
,
does
that
*NL*
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
Gania
and
Ptitsin
entered
the
room
together
,
and
Nina
*NL*
Alexandrovna
immediately
became
silent
again
.
The
prince
remained
seated
*NL*
next
to
her
,
but
Varia
moved
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
;
the
portrait
*NL*
of
Nastasia
Philipovna
remained
lying
as
before
on
the
work-table
.
Gania
*NL*
observed
it
there
,
and
with
a
frown
of
annoyance
snatched
it
up
and
*NL*
threw
it
across
to
his
writing-table
,
which
stood
at
the
other
end
of
*NL*
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
today
,
Gania
?
''
asked
Nina
Alexandrovna
,
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
what
today
?
''
cried
the
former
.
Then
suddenly
recollecting
himself
,
*NL*
he
turned
sharply
on
the
prince
.
``
Oh
,
''
he
growled
,
``
I
see
,
you
are
here
,
*NL*
that
explains
it
!
Is
it
a
disease
,
or
what
,
that
you
ca
n't
hold
your
*NL*
tongue
?
Look
here
,
understand
once
for
all
,
prince
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
to
blame
in
this
,
Gania
--
no
one
else
,
''
said
Ptitsin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gania
glanced
inquiringly
at
the
speaker
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
better
so
,
you
know
,
Gania
--
especially
as
,
from
one
point
of
view
,
*NL*
the
matter
may
be
considered
as
settled
,
''
said
Ptitsin
;
and
sitting
*NL*
down
a
little
way
from
the
table
he
began
to
study
a
paper
covered
with
*NL*
pencil
writing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gania
stood
and
frowned
,
he
expected
a
family
scene
.
He
never
thought
of
*NL*
apologizing
to
the
prince
,
however
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
's
all
settled
,
Gania
,
then
of
course
Mr.
Ptitsin
is
right
,
''
said
*NL*
Nina
Alexandrovna
.
``
Do
n't
frown
.
You
need
not
worry
yourself
,
Gania
;
*NL*
I
shall
ask
you
no
questions
.
You
need
not
tell
me
anything
you
do
n't
*NL*
like
.
I
assure
you
I
have
quite
submitted
to
your
will
.
''
She
said
all
*NL*
this
,
knitting
away
the
while
as
though
perfectly
calm
and
composed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gania
was
surprised
,
but
cautiously
kept
silence
and
looked
at
his
*NL*
mother
,
hoping
that
she
would
express
herself
more
clearly
.
Nina
*NL*
Alexandrovna
observed
his
cautiousness
and
added
,
with
a
bitter
smile
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
still
suspicious
,
I
see
,
and
do
not
believe
me
;
but
you
may
*NL*
be
quite
at
your
ease
.
There
shall
be
no
more
tears
,
nor
questions
--
not
*NL*
from
my
side
,
at
all
events
.
All
I
wish
is
that
you
may
be
happy
,
you
*NL*
know
that
.
I
have
submitted
to
my
fate
;
but
my
heart
will
always
be
*NL*
with
you
,
whether
we
remain
united
,
or
whether
we
part
.
Of
course
I
only
*NL*
answer
for
myself
--
you
can
hardly
expect
your
sister
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
sister
again
,
''
cried
Gania
,
looking
at
her
with
contempt
and
almost
*NL*
hate
.
``
Look
here
,
mother
,
I
have
already
given
you
my
word
that
I
shall
*NL*
always
respect
you
fully
and
absolutely
,
and
so
shall
everyone
else
in
*NL*
this
house
,
be
it
who
it
may
,
who
shall
cross
this
threshold
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gania
was
so
much
relieved
that
he
gazed
at
his
mother
almost
*NL*
affectionately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
not
at
all
afraid
for
myself
,
Gania
,
as
you
know
well
.
It
was
not
*NL*
for
my
own
sake
that
I
have
been
so
anxious
and
worried
all
this
time
!
*NL*
They
say
it
is
all
to
be
settled
to-day
.
What
is
to
be
settled
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
promised
to
tell
me
tonight
at
her
own
house
whether
she
*NL*
consents
or
not
,
''
replied
Gania
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
been
silent
on
this
subject
for
three
weeks
,
''
said
his
mother
,
*NL*
``
and
it
was
better
so
;
and
now
I
will
only
ask
you
one
question
.
How
can
*NL*
she
give
her
consent
and
make
you
a
present
of
her
portrait
when
you
do
*NL*
not
love
her
?
How
can
such
a
--
such
a

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Practised
hand
--
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
not
going
to
express
myself
so
.
But
how
could
you
so
blind
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nina
Alexandrovna
's
question
betrayed
intense
annoyance
.
Gania
waited
a
*NL*
moment
and
then
said
,
without
taking
the
trouble
to
conceal
the
irony
of
*NL*
his
tone
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
you
are
,
mother
,
you
are
always
like
that
.
You
begin
by
promising
*NL*
that
there
are
to
be
no
reproaches
or
insinuations
or
questions
,
and
*NL*
here
you
are
beginning
them
at
once
.
We
had
better
drop
the
subject
--
we
*NL*
had
,
really
.
I
shall
never
leave
you
,
mother
;
any
other
man
would
cut
*NL*
and
run
from
such
a
sister
as
this
.
See
how
she
is
looking
at
me
at
this
*NL*
moment
!
Besides
,
how
do
you
know
that
I
am
blinding
Nastasia
Philipovna
?
*NL*
As
for
Varia
,
I
do
n't
care
--
she
can
do
just
as
she
pleases
.
There
,
*NL*
that
's
quite
enough
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gania
's
irritation
increased
with
every
word
he
uttered
,
as
he
walked
up
*NL*
and
down
the
room
.
These
conversations
always
touched
the
family
sores
*NL*
before
long
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
said
already
that
the
moment
she
comes
in
I
go
out
,
and
I
shall
*NL*
keep
my
word
,
''
remarked
Varia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Out
of
obstinacy
''
shouted
Gania
.
``
You
have
n't
married
,
either
,
thanks
*NL*
to
your
obstinacy
.
Oh
,
you
need
n't
frown
at
me
,
Varvara
!
You
can
go
at
*NL*
once
for
all
I
care
;
I
am
sick
enough
of
your
company
.
What
,
you
are
*NL*
going
to
leave
us
are
you
,
too
?
''
he
cried
,
turning
to
the
prince
,
who
*NL*
was
rising
from
his
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gania
's
voice
was
full
of
the
most
uncontrolled
and
uncontrollable
*NL*
irritation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
turned
at
the
door
to
say
something
,
but
perceiving
in
*NL*
Gania
's
expression
that
there
was
but
that
one
drop
wanting
to
make
the
*NL*
cup
overflow
,
he
changed
his
mind
and
left
the
room
without
a
word
.
*NL*
A
few
minutes
later
he
was
aware
from
the
noisy
voices
in
the
drawing
*NL*
room
,
that
the
conversation
had
become
more
quarrelsome
than
ever
after
*NL*
his
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
crossed
the
salon
and
the
entrance-hall
,
so
as
to
pass
down
the
*NL*
corridor
into
his
own
room
.
As
he
came
near
the
front
door
he
heard
*NL*
someone
outside
vainly
endeavouring
to
ring
the
bell
,
which
was
*NL*
evidently
broken
,
and
only
shook
a
little
,
without
emitting
any
sound
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
took
down
the
chain
and
opened
the
door
.
He
started
back
in
*NL*
amazement
--
for
there
stood
Nastasia
Philipovna
.
He
knew
her
at
once
from
*NL*
her
photograph
.
Her
eyes
blazed
with
anger
as
she
looked
at
him
.
She
*NL*
quickly
pushed
by
him
into
the
hall
,
shouldering
him
out
of
her
way
,
and
*NL*
said
,
furiously
,
as
she
threw
off
her
fur
cloak
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
are
too
lazy
to
mend
your
bell
,
you
should
at
least
wait
in
*NL*
the
hall
to
let
people
in
when
they
rattle
the
bell
handle
.
There
,
now
,
*NL*
you
've
dropped
my
fur
cloak
--
dummy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sure
enough
the
cloak
was
lying
on
the
ground
.
Nastasia
had
thrown
it
*NL*
off
her
towards
the
prince
,
expecting
him
to
catch
it
,
but
the
prince
*NL*
had
missed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
then
--
announce
me
,
quick
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
wanted
to
say
something
,
but
was
so
confused
and
astonished
*NL*
that
he
could
not
.
However
,
he
moved
off
towards
the
drawing-room
with
*NL*
the
cloak
over
his
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
then
,
where
are
you
taking
my
cloak
to
?
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
Are
you
mad
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
turned
and
came
back
,
more
confused
than
ever
.
When
she
burst
*NL*
out
laughing
,
he
smiled
,
but
his
tongue
could
not
form
a
word
as
yet
.
At
*NL*
first
,
when
he
had
opened
the
door
and
saw
her
standing
before
him
,
he
*NL*
had
become
as
pale
as
death
;
but
now
the
red
blood
had
rushed
back
to
*NL*
his
cheeks
in
a
torrent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
an
idiot
it
is
!
''
cried
Nastasia
,
stamping
her
foot
with
*NL*
irritation
.
``
Go
on
,
do
!
Whom
are
you
going
to
announce
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nastasia
Philipovna
,
''
murmured
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
do
you
know
that
?
''
she
asked
him
,
sharply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
never
seen
you
before
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
on
,
announce
me
--
what
's
that
noise
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
quarrelling
,
''
said
the
prince
,
and
entered
the
drawing-room
,
*NL*
just
as
matters
in
there
had
almost
reached
a
crisis
.
Nina
Alexandrovna
*NL*
had
forgotten
that
she
had
``
submitted
to
everything
!
''
She
was
defending
*NL*
Varia
.
Ptitsin
was
taking
her
part
,
too
.
Not
that
Varia
was
afraid
of
*NL*
standing
up
for
herself
.
She
was
by
no
means
that
sort
of
a
girl
;
but
*NL*
her
brother
was
becoming
ruder
and
more
intolerable
every
moment
.
Her
*NL*
usual
practice
in
such
cases
as
the
present
was
to
say
nothing
,
but
*NL*
stare
at
him
,
without
taking
her
eyes
off
his
face
for
an
instant
.
This
*NL*
manoeuvre
,
as
she
well
knew
,
could
drive
Gania
distracted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
at
this
moment
the
door
opened
and
the
prince
entered
,
announcing
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nastasia
Philipovna
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
IX
.
*NL*
*NL*
Silence
immediately
fell
on
the
room
;
all
looked
at
the
prince
as
though
*NL*
they
neither
understood
,
nor
hoped
to
understand
.
Gania
was
motionless
*NL*
with
horror
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nastasia
's
arrival
was
a
most
unexpected
and
overwhelming
event
to
all
*NL*
parties
.
In
the
first
place
,
she
had
never
been
before
.
Up
to
now
she
*NL*
had
been
so
haughty
that
she
had
never
even
asked
Gania
to
introduce
her
*NL*
to
his
parents
.
Of
late
she
had
not
so
much
as
mentioned
them
.
Gania
was
*NL*
partly
glad
of
this
;
but
still
he
had
put
it
to
her
debit
in
the
account
*NL*
to
be
settled
after
marriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
would
have
borne
anything
from
her
rather
than
this
visit
.
But
one
*NL*
thing
seemed
to
him
quite
clear-her
visit
now
,
and
the
present
of
her
*NL*
portrait
on
this
particular
day
,
pointed
out
plainly
enough
which
way
*NL*
she
intended
to
make
her
decision
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
incredulous
amazement
with
which
all
regarded
the
prince
did
not
*NL*
last
long
,
for
Nastasia
herself
appeared
at
the
door
and
passed
in
,
*NL*
pushing
by
the
prince
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
last
I
've
stormed
the
citadel
!
Why
do
you
tie
up
your
bell
?
''
she
*NL*
said
,
merrily
,
as
she
pressed
Gania
's
hand
,
the
latter
having
rushed
*NL*
up
to
her
as
soon
as
she
made
her
appearance
.
``
What
are
you
looking
so
*NL*
upset
about
?
Introduce
me
,
please
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
bewildered
Gania
introduced
her
first
to
Varia
,
and
both
women
,
*NL*
before
shaking
hands
,
exchanged
looks
of
strange
import
.
Nastasia
,
*NL*
however
,
smiled
amiably
;
but
Varia
did
not
try
to
look
amiable
,
and
kept
*NL*
her
gloomy
expression
.
She
did
not
even
vouchsafe
the
usual
courteous
*NL*
smile
of
etiquette
.
Gania
darted
a
terrible
glance
of
wrath
at
her
*NL*
for
this
,
but
Nina
Alexandrovna
mended
matters
a
little
when
Gania
*NL*
introduced
her
at
last
.
Hardly
,
however
,
had
the
old
lady
begun
about
*NL*
her
``
highly
gratified
feelings
,
''
and
so
on
,
when
Nastasia
left
her
,
and
*NL*
flounced
into
a
chair
by
Gania
's
side
in
the
corner
by
the
window
,
and
*NL*
cried
:
``
Where
's
your
study
?
and
where
are
the
--
the
lodgers
?
You
do
take
*NL*
in
lodgers
,
do
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gania
looked
dreadfully
put
out
,
and
tried
to
say
something
in
reply
,
*NL*
but
Nastasia
interrupted
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
where
are
you
going
to
squeeze
lodgers
in
here
?
Do
n't
you
use
*NL*
a
study
?
Does
this
sort
of
thing
pay
?
''
she
added
,
turning
to
Nina
*NL*
Alexandrovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
is
troublesome
,
rather
,
''
said
the
latter
;
``
but
I
suppose
it
*NL*
will
`
pay
'
pretty
well
.
We
have
only
just
begun
,
however
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
Nastasia
Philipovna
did
not
hear
the
sentence
out
.
She
glanced
at
*NL*
Gania
,
and
cried
,
laughing
,
``
What
a
face
!
My
goodness
,
what
a
face
you
*NL*
have
on
at
this
moment
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Indeed
,
Gania
did
not
look
in
the
least
like
himself
.
His
bewilderment
*NL*
and
his
alarmed
perplexity
passed
off
,
however
,
and
his
lips
now
*NL*
twitched
with
rage
as
he
continued
to
stare
evilly
at
his
laughing
*NL*
guest
,
while
his
countenance
became
absolutely
livid
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
another
witness
,
who
,
though
standing
at
the
door
motionless
*NL*
and
bewildered
himself
,
still
managed
to
remark
Gania
's
death-like
*NL*
pallor
,
and
the
dreadful
change
that
had
come
over
his
face
.
This
*NL*
witness
was
the
prince
,
who
now
advanced
in
alarm
and
muttered
to
Gania
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Drink
some
water
,
and
do
n't
look
like
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
clear
that
he
came
out
with
these
words
quite
spontaneously
,
on
*NL*
the
spur
of
the
moment
.
But
his
speech
was
productive
of
much
--
for
*NL*
it
appeared
that
all
Gania
's
rage
now
overflowed
upon
the
prince
.
He
*NL*
seized
him
by
the
shoulder
and
gazed
with
an
intensity
of
loathing
and
*NL*
revenge
at
him
,
but
said
nothing
--
as
though
his
feelings
were
too
strong
*NL*
to
permit
of
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
General
agitation
prevailed
.
Nina
Alexandrovna
gave
a
little
cry
of
*NL*
anxiety
;
Ptitsin
took
a
step
forward
in
alarm
;
Colia
and
Ferdishenko
*NL*
stood
stock
still
at
the
door
in
amazement
;
--
only
Varia
remained
coolly
*NL*
watching
the
scene
from
under
her
eyelashes
.
She
did
not
sit
down
,
*NL*
but
stood
by
her
mother
with
folded
hands
.
However
,
Gania
recollected
*NL*
himself
almost
immediately
.
He
let
go
of
the
prince
and
burst
out
*NL*
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
are
you
a
doctor
,
prince
,
or
what
?
''
he
asked
,
as
naturally
as
*NL*
possible
.
``
I
declare
you
quite
frightened
me
!
Nastasia
Philipovna
,
let
*NL*
me
introduce
this
interesting
character
to
you
--
though
I
have
only
known
*NL*
him
myself
since
the
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nastasia
gazed
at
the
prince
in
bewilderment
.
``
Prince
?
He
a
Prince
?
Why
,
*NL*
I
took
him
for
the
footman
,
just
now
,
and
sent
him
in
to
announce
me
!
*NL*
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
,
is
n't
that
good
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
bad
that
,
not
bad
at
all
!
''
put
in
Ferdishenko
,
''
_
se
non
e
vero
_
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
rather
think
I
pitched
into
you
,
too
,
did
n't
I
?
Forgive
me
--
do
!
Who
*NL*
is
he
,
did
you
say
?
What
prince
?
Muishkin
?
''
she
added
,
addressing
Gania
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
a
lodger
of
ours
,
''
explained
the
latter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
idiot
!
''
--
the
prince
distinctly
heard
the
word
half
whispered
from
*NL*
behind
him
.
This
was
Ferdishenko
's
voluntary
information
for
Nastasia
's
*NL*
benefit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
,
why
did
n't
you
put
me
right
when
I
made
such
a
dreadful
*NL*
mistake
just
now
?
''
continued
the
latter
,
examining
the
prince
from
head
*NL*
to
foot
without
the
slightest
ceremony
.
She
awaited
the
answer
as
though
*NL*
convinced
that
it
would
be
so
foolish
that
she
must
inevitably
fail
to
*NL*
restrain
her
laughter
over
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
astonished
,
seeing
you
so
suddenly
--
''
murmured
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
did
you
know
who
I
was
?
Where
had
you
seen
me
before
?
And
why
were
*NL*
you
so
struck
dumb
at
the
sight
of
me
?
What
was
there
so
overwhelming
*NL*
about
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oho
!
ho
,
ho
,
ho
!
''
cried
Ferdishenko
.
''
_
Now
_
then
,
prince
!
My
word
,
*NL*
what
things
I
would
say
if
I
had
such
a
chance
as
that
!
My
goodness
,
*NL*
prince
--
go
on
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
should
I
,
in
your
place
,
I
've
no
doubt
!
''
laughed
the
prince
to
*NL*
Ferdishenko
;
then
continued
,
addressing
Nastasia
:
``
Your
portrait
struck
*NL*
me
very
forcibly
this
morning
;
then
I
was
talking
about
you
to
the
*NL*
Epanchins
;
and
then
,
in
the
train
,
before
I
reached
Petersburg
,
Parfen
*NL*
Rogojin
told
me
a
good
deal
about
you
;
and
at
the
very
moment
that
I
*NL*
opened
the
door
to
you
I
happened
to
be
thinking
of
you
,
when
--
there
you
*NL*
stood
before
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
did
you
recognize
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
the
portrait
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
else
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
seemed
to
imagine
you
exactly
as
you
are
--
I
seemed
to
have
seen
you
*NL*
somewhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
--
where
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
seem
to
have
seen
your
eyes
somewhere
;
but
it
can
not
be
!
I
have
not
*NL*
seen
you
--
I
never
was
here
before
.
I
may
have
dreamed
of
you
,
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
said
all
this
with
manifest
effort
--
in
broken
sentences
,
and
*NL*
with
many
drawings
of
breath
.
He
was
evidently
much
agitated
.
Nastasia
*NL*
Philipovna
looked
at
him
inquisitively
,
but
did
not
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bravo
,
prince
!
''
cried
Ferdishenko
,
delighted
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
a
loud
voice
from
behind
the
group
which
hedged
in
the
*NL*
prince
and
Nastasia
Philipovna
,
divided
the
crowd
,
as
it
were
,
and
*NL*
before
them
stood
the
head
of
the
family
,
General
Ivolgin
.
He
was
*NL*
dressed
in
evening
clothes
;
his
moustache
was
dyed
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
apparition
was
too
much
for
Gania
.
Vain
and
ambitious
almost
to
*NL*
morbidness
,
he
had
had
much
to
put
up
with
in
the
last
two
months
,
and
*NL*
was
seeking
feverishly
for
some
means
of
enabling
himself
to
lead
a
more
*NL*
presentable
kind
of
existence
.
At
home
,
he
now
adopted
an
attitude
*NL*
of
absolute
cynicism
,
but
he
could
not
keep
this
up
before
Nastasia
*NL*
Philipovna
,
although
he
had
sworn
to
make
her
pay
after
marriage
for
all
*NL*
he
suffered
now
.
He
was
experiencing
a
last
humiliation
,
the
bitterest
*NL*
of
all
,
at
this
moment
--
the
humiliation
of
blushing
for
his
own
kindred
*NL*
in
his
own
house
.
A
question
flashed
through
his
mind
as
to
whether
the
*NL*
game
was
really
worth
the
candle
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
that
had
happened
at
this
moment
,
which
for
two
months
had
been
his
*NL*
nightmare
;
which
had
filled
his
soul
with
dread
and
shame
--
the
meeting
*NL*
between
his
father
and
Nastasia
Philipovna
.
He
had
often
tried
to
*NL*
imagine
such
an
event
,
but
had
found
the
picture
too
mortifying
and
*NL*
exasperating
,
and
had
quietly
dropped
it
.
Very
likely
he
anticipated
*NL*
far
worse
things
than
was
at
all
necessary
;
it
is
often
so
with
vain
*NL*
persons
.
He
had
long
since
determined
,
therefore
,
to
get
his
father
*NL*
out
of
the
way
,
anywhere
,
before
his
marriage
,
in
order
to
avoid
such
*NL*
a
meeting
;
but
when
Nastasia
entered
the
room
just
now
,
he
had
been
so
*NL*
overwhelmed
with
astonishment
,
that
he
had
not
thought
of
his
father
,
*NL*
and
had
made
no
arrangements
to
keep
him
out
of
the
way
.
And
now
it
was
*NL*
too
late
--
there
he
was
,
and
got
up
,
too
,
in
a
dress
coat
and
white
tie
,
*NL*
and
Nastasia
in
the
very
humour
to
heap
ridicule
on
him
and
his
family
*NL*
circle
;
of
this
last
fact
,
he
felt
quite
persuaded
.
What
else
had
she
*NL*
come
for
?
There
were
his
mother
and
his
sister
sitting
before
her
,
and
*NL*
she
seemed
to
have
forgotten
their
very
existence
already
;
and
if
she
*NL*
behaved
like
that
,
he
thought
,
she
must
have
some
object
in
view
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ferdishenko
led
the
general
up
to
Nastasia
Philipovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ardalion
Alexandrovitch
Ivolgin
,
''
said
the
smiling
general
,
with
a
low
*NL*
bow
of
great
dignity
,
``
an
old
soldier
,
unfortunate
,
and
the
father
*NL*
of
this
family
;
but
happy
in
the
hope
of
including
in
that
family
so
*NL*
exquisite
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
finish
his
sentence
,
for
at
this
moment
Ferdishenko
pushed
*NL*
a
chair
up
from
behind
,
and
the
general
,
not
very
firm
on
his
legs
,
*NL*
at
this
post-prandial
hour
,
flopped
into
it
backwards
.
It
was
always
a
*NL*
difficult
thing
to
put
this
warrior
to
confusion
,
and
his
sudden
*NL*
descent
left
him
as
composed
as
before
.
He
had
sat
down
just
opposite
to
*NL*
Nastasia
,
whose
fingers
he
now
took
,
and
raised
to
his
lips
with
great
*NL*
elegance
,
and
much
courtesy
.
The
general
had
once
belonged
to
a
very
*NL*
select
circle
of
society
,
but
he
had
been
turned
out
of
it
two
or
three
*NL*
years
since
on
account
of
certain
weaknesses
,
in
which
he
now
indulged
*NL*
with
all
the
less
restraint
;
but
his
good
manners
remained
with
him
to
*NL*
this
day
,
in
spite
of
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nastasia
Philipovna
seemed
delighted
at
the
appearance
of
this
latest
*NL*
arrival
,
of
whom
she
had
of
course
heard
a
good
deal
by
report
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
heard
that
my
son
--
''
began
Ardalion
Alexandrovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
son
,
indeed
!
A
nice
papa
you
are
!
_
You
_
might
have
come
to
see
me
*NL*
anyhow
,
without
compromising
anyone
.
Do
you
hide
yourself
,
or
does
your
*NL*
son
hide

*NL*
*NL*
``
The

century

began
the
*NL*
general
,
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

Philipovna
,

you
excuse

for
a
moment

*NL*
Someone
is
inquiring
for

said
Nina
Alexandrovna
in
a
loud
voice
,
*NL*
interrupting
the
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
him
?
Oh
no
,
I
have
wished
to
see
him
too
long
for
that

Why

business
can
he
have

He
has
retired

he

You

you

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
give
you
my

he
needs

rest
just
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
General
,
they
say
you
require
rest
,
''
said
Nastasia
Philipovna
,
with
the
*NL*
melancholy
face
of
a
child
whose
toy
is
taken
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ardalion
Alexandrovitch
immediately
did
his
best
to
make
his
foolish
*NL*
position
a
great
deal
worse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
my
dear
!
''
he
said
,
solemnly
and
reproachfully
,
looking
at
his
*NL*
wife
,
with
one
hand
on
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo
n't
you
leave
the
room

mamma
?
''
asked
Varia
,
aloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Varia
,
I
shall
sit
it
out
to
the
end
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nastasia
must
have
overheard
both
question
and
reply
,
but
her
vivacity
*NL*
was
not
in
the
least
damped
.
On
the
contrary
,
it
seemed
to
increase
.
She
*NL*
immediately
overwhelmed
the
general
once
more
with
questions
,
and
within
*NL*
five
minutes
that
gentleman
was
as
happy
as
a
king
,
and
holding
forth
at
*NL*
the
top
of
his
voice
,
amid
the
laughter
of
almost
all
who
heard
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Colia
jogged
the
prince
's
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ca
n't
_
you
_
get
him
out
of
the
room
,
somehow
?
_
Do
_
,
please
,
''
and
tears
*NL*
of
annoyance
stood
in
the
boy
's
eyes
.
``
Curse
that
Gania
!
''
he
muttered
,
*NL*
between
his
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
I
knew
General
Epanchin
well
,
''
General
Ivolgin
was
saying
at
*NL*
this
moment
;
``
he
and
Prince
Nicolai
Ivanovitch
Muishkin
--
whose
son
I
*NL*
have
this
day
embraced
after
an
absence

twenty
years
--
and
I
,
*NL*
were
three
inseparables
.
Alas
one
is
in
the
grave
,
torn
to
pieces
by
*NL*
calumnies
and
bullets
;
another
is
now
before
you
,
still
battling
with
*NL*
calumnies
and
bullets

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bullets
?
''
cried
Nastasia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
here
in
my
chest
.
I
received
them
at
the
siege
of
Kars
,
and
I
feel
*NL*
them
in
bad
weather
now
.
And
as
to
the
third
of
our
trio
,
Epanchin
,
of
*NL*
course
after
that
little
affair
with
the
poodle
in
the
railway
carriage
,
*NL*
it
was
all
_
up
_
between
us

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poodle
?
What
was
that
?
And
in
a
railway
carriage
?
Dear
me
,
''
said
*NL*
Nastasia
,
thoughtfully
,
as
though
trying
to
recall
something
to
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
just
a
silly
,
little
occurrence
,
really
not
worth
telling

about
*NL*
Princess
Bielokonski

governess
,
Miss
Smith
,
and
--
oh
,
it
is
really
not
*NL*
worth
telling
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
we
must
have
it
!

cried
Nastasia
merrily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

of
course

said
Ferdishenko
.
``
C'est
du
nouveau

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ardalion
,
''
said
Nina
Alexandrovitch
,
entreatingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Papa
,
you
are
wanted
!
''
cried
Colia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
is
a
silly
little
story
,
in
a
few
words
,
''
began
the
delighted
*NL*
general
.
``
A
couple
of
years
ago
,
soon
after
the
new
railway
was
opened
,
*NL*
I
had
to
go
somewhere
or
other
on
business
.
Well
,
I
took
a
first-class
*NL*
ticket
,
sat
down
,
and
began
to
smoke
,
or
rather
_
continued
_
to
smoke
,
for
*NL*
I
had
lighted
up
before
.
I
was
alone
in
the
carriage
.
Smoking
is
not
*NL*
allowed
,
but
is
not
prohibited
either
;
it
is
half
allowed
--
so
to
speak
,
*NL*
winked
at
.
I
had
the
window
open
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Suddenly
,
just
before
the
whistle
,
in
came
two
ladies
with
a
little
*NL*
poodle
,
and
sat
down
opposite
to
me
;
not
bad-looking
women
;
one
was
in
*NL*
light
blue
,
the
other
in
black
silk
.
The
poodle
,
a
beauty
with
a
silver
*NL*
collar
,
lay
on
light
blue
's
knee
.
They
looked
haughtily
about
,
and
*NL*
talked
English
together
.
I
took
no
notice
,
just
went
on
smoking
.
I
*NL*
observed
that
the
ladies
were
getting
angry
--
over
my
cigar
,
doubtless
.
*NL*
One
looked
at
me
through
her
tortoise-shell
eyeglass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
took
no
notice
,
because
they
never
said
a
word
.
If
they
did
n't
like
*NL*
the
cigar
,
why
could
n't
they
say
so
?
Not
a
word
,
not
a
hint
!
Suddenly
,
*NL*
and
without
the
very
slightest
suspicion
of
warning
,
`
light
blue
'
seizes
*NL*
my
cigar
from
between
my
fingers
,
and
,
wheugh
!
out
of
the
window
with
*NL*
it
!
Well
,
on
flew
the
train
,
and
I
sat
bewildered
,
and
the
young
woman
,
*NL*
tall
and
fair
,
and
rather
red
in
the
face
,
too
red
,
glared
at
me
with
*NL*
flashing
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
say
a
word
,
but
with
extreme
courtesy
,
I
may
say
with
most
*NL*
refined
courtesy
,
I
reached
my
finger
and
thumb
over
towards
the
poodle
,
*NL*
took
it
up
delicately
by
the
nape
of
the
neck
,
and
chucked
it
out
of
*NL*
the
window
,
after
the
cigar
.
The
train
went
flying
on
,
and
the
poodle
's
*NL*
yells
were
lost
in
the
distance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
naughty
man
!
''
cried
Nastasia
,
laughing
and
clapping
her
hands
*NL*
like
a
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bravo
!
''
said
Ferdishenko
.
Ptitsin
laughed
too
,
though
he
had
been
very
*NL*
sorry
to
see
the
general
appear
.
Even
Colia
laughed
and
said
,
``
Bravo
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
was
right
,
truly
right
,
''
cried
the
general
,
with
warmth
and
*NL*
solemnity
,
``
for
if
cigars
are
forbidden
in
railway
carriages
,
poodles
*NL*
are
much
more
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
what
did
the
lady
do
?
''
asked
Nastasia
,
impatiently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
--
ah
,
that
's
where
all
the
mischief
of
it
lies
!
''
replied
Ivolgin
,
*NL*
frowning
.
``
Without
a
word
,
as
it
were
,
of
warning
,
she
slapped
me
on
the
*NL*
cheek
!
An
extraordinary
woman
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
general
dropped
his
eyes
,
and
elevated
his
brows
;
shrugged
his
*NL*
shoulders
,
tightened
his
lips
,
spread
his
hands
,
and
remained
silent
.
At
*NL*
last
he
blurted
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
lost
my
head
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
hit
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
oh
no
!
--
there
was
a
great
flare-up
,
but
I
did
n't
hit
her
!
I
had
to
*NL*
struggle
a
little
,
purely
to
defend
myself
;
but
the
very
devil
was
*NL*
in
the
business
.
It
turned
out
that
`
light
blue
'
was
an
Englishwoman
,
*NL*
governess
or
something
,
at
Princess
Bielokonski
's
,
and
the
other
woman
*NL*
was
one
of
the
old-maid
princesses
Bielokonski
.
Well
,
everybody
knows
*NL*
what
great
friends
the
princess
and
Mrs.
Epanchin
are
,
so
there
was
a
*NL*
pretty
kettle
of
fish
.
All
the
Bielokonskis
went
into
mourning
for
the
*NL*
poodle
.
Six
princesses
in
tears
,
and
the
Englishwoman
shrieking
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
wrote
an
apology
,
and
called
,
but
they
would
not
receive
*NL*
either
me
or
my
apology
,
and
the
Epanchins
cut
me
,
too
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
wait
,
''
said
Nastasia
.
``
How
is
it
that
,
five
or
six
days
since
,
*NL*
I
read
exactly
the
same
story
in
the
paper
,
as
happening
between
a
*NL*
Frenchman
and
an
English
girl
?
The
cigar
was
snatched
away
exactly
as
*NL*
you
describe
,
and
the
poodle
was
chucked
out
of
the
window
after
it
.
The
*NL*
slapping
came
off
,
too
,
as
in
your
case
;
and
the
girl
's
dress
was
light
*NL*
blue
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
general
blushed
dreadfully
;
Colia
blushed
too
;
and
Ptitsin
turned
*NL*
hastily
away
.
Ferdishenko
was
the
only
one
who
laughed
as
gaily
as
*NL*
before
.
As
to
Gania
,
I
need
not
say
that
he
was
miserable
;
he
stood
dumb
*NL*
and
wretched
and
took
no
notice
of
anybody
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
assure
you
,
''
said
the
general
,
``
that
exactly
the
same
thing
happened
*NL*
to
myself
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
remembered
there
was
some
quarrel
between
father
and
Miss
Smith
,
the
*NL*
Bielokonski
's
governess
,
''
said
Colia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
very
curious
,
point
for
point
the
same
anecdote
,
and
happening
at
*NL*
different
ends
of
Europe
!
Even
the
light
blue
dress
the
same
,
''
continued
*NL*
the
pitiless
Nastasia
.
``
I
must
really
send
you
the
paper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
observe
,
''
insisted
the
general
,
``
that
my
experience
was
two
*NL*
years
earlier
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
that
's
it
,
no
doubt
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nastasia
Philipovna
laughed
hysterically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
,
will
you
hear
a
word
from
me
outside
!
''
said
Gania
,
his
voice
*NL*
shaking
with
agitation
,
as
he
seized
his
father
by
the
shoulder
.
His
*NL*
eyes
shone
with
a
blaze
of
hatred
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
there
was
a
terrific
bang
at
the
front
door
,
almost
*NL*
enough
to
break
it
down
.
Some
most
unusual
visitor
must
have
arrived
.
*NL*
Colia
ran
to
open
.
*NL*
*NL*
X
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
entrance-hall
suddenly
became
full
of
noise
and
people
.
To
judge
*NL*
from
the
sounds
which
penetrated
to
the
drawing-room
,
a
number
of
people
*NL*
had
already
come
in
,
and
the
stampede
continued
.
Several
voices
were
*NL*
talking
and
shouting
at
once
;
others
were
talking
and
shouting
on
the
*NL*
stairs
outside
;
it
was
evidently
a
most
extraordinary
visit
that
was
*NL*
about
to
take
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everyone
exchanged
startled
glances
.
Gania
rushed
out
towards
the
*NL*
dining-room
,
but
a
number
of
men
had
already
made
their
way
in
,
and
met
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
here
he
is
,
the
Judas
!
''
cried
a
voice
which
the
prince
recognized
*NL*
at
once
.
``
How
d'ye
do
,
Gania
,
you
old
blackguard
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
's
the
man
!
''
said
another
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
room
for
doubt
in
the
prince
's
mind
:
one
of
the
voices
was
*NL*
Rogojin
's
,
and
the
other
Lebedeff
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gania
stood
at
the
door
like
a
block
and
looked
on
in
silence
,
putting
*NL*
no
obstacle
in
the
way
of
their
entrance
,
and
ten
or
a
dozen
men
*NL*
marched
in
behind
Parfen
Rogojin
.
They
were
a
decidedly
mixed-looking
*NL*
collection
,
and
some
of
them
came
in
in
their
furs
and
caps
.
None
of
*NL*
them
were
quite
drunk
,
but
all
appeared
to
be
considerably
excited
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
seemed
to
need
each
other
's
support
,
morally
,
before
they
dared
*NL*
come
in
;
not
one
of
them
would
have
entered
alone
but
with
the
rest
each
*NL*
one
was
brave
enough
.
Even
Rogojin
entered
rather
cautiously
at
the
head
*NL*
of
his
troop
;
but
he
was
evidently
preoccupied
.
He
appeared
to
be
gloomy
*NL*
and
morose
,
and
had
clearly
come
with
some
end
in
view
.
All
the
rest
*NL*
were
merely
chorus
,
brought
in
to
support
the
chief
character
.
Besides
*NL*
Lebedeff
there
was
the
dandy
Zalesheff
,
who
came
in
without
his
coat
*NL*
and
hat
,
two
or
three
others
followed
his
example
;
the
rest
were
*NL*
more
uncouth
.
They
included
a
couple
of
young
merchants
,
a
man
in
*NL*
a
great-coat
,
a
medical
student
,
a
little
Pole
,
a
small
fat
man
who
*NL*
laughed
continuously
,
and
an
enormously
tall
stout
one
who
apparently
*NL*
put
great
faith
in
the
strength
of
his
fists
.
A
couple
of
``
ladies
''
of
*NL*
some
sort
put
their
heads
in
at
the
front
door
,
but
did
not
dare
come
*NL*
any
farther
.
Colia
promptly
banged
the
door
in
their
faces
and
locked
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hallo
,
Gania
,
you
blackguard
!
You
did
n't
expect
Rogojin
,
eh
?
''
said
the
*NL*
latter
,
entering
the
drawing-room
,
and
stopping
before
Gania
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
this
moment
he
saw
,
seated
before
him
,
Nastasia
Philipovna
.
*NL*
He
had
not
dreamed
of
meeting
her
here
,
evidently
,
for
her
appearance
*NL*
produced
a
marvellous
effect
upon
him
.
He
grew
pale
,
and
his
lips
became
*NL*
actually
blue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
it
is
true
,
then
!
''
he
muttered
to
himself
,
and
his
face
took
*NL*
on
an
expression
of
despair
.
``
So
that
's
the
end
of
it
!
Now
you
,
sir
,
*NL*
will
you
answer
me
or
not
?
''
he
went
on
suddenly
,
gazing
at
Gania
with
*NL*
ineffable
malice
.
``
Now
then
,
you
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
panted
,
and
could
hardly
speak
for
agitation
.
He
advanced
into
the
*NL*
room
mechanically
;
but
perceiving
Nina
Alexandrovna
and
Varia
he
became
*NL*
more
or
less
embarrassed
,
in
spite
of
his
excitement
.
His
followers
*NL*
entered
after
him
,
and
all
paused
a
moment
at
sight
of
the
ladies
.
Of
*NL*
course
their
modesty
was
not
fated
to
be
long-lived
,
but
for
a
moment
*NL*
they
were
abashed
.
Once
let
them
begin
to
shout
,
however
,
and
nothing
on
*NL*
earth
should
disconcert
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
you
here
too
,
prince
?
''
said
Rogojin
,
absently
,
but
a
little
*NL*
surprised
all
the
same
``
Still
in
your
gaiters
,
eh
?
''
He
sighed
,
and
*NL*
forgot
the
prince
next
moment
,
and
his
wild
eyes
wandered
over
to
*NL*
Nastasia
again
,
as
though
attracted
in
that
direction
by
some
magnetic
*NL*
force
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nastasia
looked
at
the
new
arrivals
with
great
curiosity
.
Gania
*NL*
recollected
himself
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
sirs
,
''
he
said
,
loudly
,
``
but
what
does
all
this
mean
?
''
*NL*
He
glared
at
the
advancing
crowd
generally
,
but
addressed
his
remarks
*NL*
especially
to
their
captain
,
Rogojin
.
``
You
are
not
in
a
stable
,
*NL*
gentlemen
,
though
you
may
think
it
--
my
mother
and
sister
are
present
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
see
your
mother
and
sister
,
''
muttered
Rogojin
,
through
his
*NL*
teeth
;
and
Lebedeff
seemed
to
feel
himself
called
upon
to
second
the
*NL*
statement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
all
events
,
I
must
request
you
to
step
into
the
salon
,
''
said
Gania
,
*NL*
his
rage
rising
quite
out
of
proportion
to
his
words
,
``
and
then
I
shall
*NL*
inquire
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
he
does
n't
know
me
!
''
said
Rogojin
,
showing
his
teeth
*NL*
disagreeably
.
``
He
does
n't
recognize
Rogojin
!
''
He
did
not
move
an
inch
,
*NL*
however
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
met
you
somewhere
,
I
believe
,
but
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Met
me
somewhere
,
pfu
!
Why
,
it
's
only
three
months
since
I
lost
two
*NL*
hundred
roubles
of
my
father
's
money
to
you
,
at
cards
.
The
old
fellow
*NL*
died
before
he
found
out
.
Ptitsin
knows
all
about
it
.
Why
,
I
've
only
to
*NL*
pull
out
a
three-rouble
note
and
show
it
to
you
,
and
you
'd
crawl
on
your
*NL*
hands
and
knees
to
the
other
end
of
the
town
for
it
;
that
's
the
sort
of
*NL*
man
you
are
.
Why
,
I
've
come
now
,
at
this
moment
,
to
buy
you
up
!
Oh
,
you
*NL*
need
n't
think
that
because
I
wear
these
boots
I
have
no
money
.
I
have
*NL*
lots
of
money
,
my
beauty
,
--
enough
to
buy
up
you
and
all
yours
together
.
*NL*
So
I
shall
,
if
I
like
to
!
I
'll
buy
you
up
!
I
will
!
''
he
yelled
,
*NL*
apparently
growing
more
and
more
intoxicated
and
excited
.
``
Oh
,
Nastasia
*NL*
Philipovna
!
do
n't
turn
me
out
!
Say
one
word
,
do
!
Are
you
going
to
marry
*NL*
this
man
,
or
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rogojin
asked
his
question
like
a
lost
soul
appealing
to
some
divinity
,
*NL*
with
the
reckless
daring
of
one
appointed
to
die
,
who
has
nothing
to
*NL*
lose
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
awaited
the
reply
in
deadly
anxiety
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nastasia
Philipovna
gazed
at
him
with
a
haughty
,
ironical
expression
of
*NL*
face
;
but
when
she
glanced
at
Nina
Alexandrovna
and
Varia
,
and
from
them
*NL*
to
Gania
,
she
changed
her
tone
,
all
of
a
sudden
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
not
;
what
are
you
thinking
of
?
What
could
have
induced
you
*NL*
to
ask
such
a
question
?
''
she
replied
,
quietly
and
seriously
,
and
even
,
*NL*
apparently
,
with
some
astonishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
?
No
?
''
shouted
Rogojin
,
almost
out
of
his
mind
with
joy
.
``
You
are
*NL*
not
going
to
,
after
all
?
And
they
told
me
--
oh
,
Nastasia
Philipovna
--
they
*NL*
said
you
had
promised
to
marry
him
,
_
him
!
_
As
if
you
_
could
_
do
*NL*
it
!
--
him
--
pooh
!
I
do
n't
mind
saying
it
to
everyone
--
I
'd
buy
him
off
*NL*
for
a
hundred
roubles
,
any
day
pfu
!
Give
him
a
thousand
,
or
three
if
he
*NL*
likes
,
poor
devil
,
and
he
'd
cut
and
run
the
day
before
his
wedding
,
and
*NL*
leave
his
bride
to
me
!
Would
n't
you
,
Gania
,
you
blackguard
?
You
'd
take
*NL*
three
thousand
,
would
n't
you
?
Here
's
the
money
!
Look
,
I
've
come
on
*NL*
purpose
to
pay
you
off
and
get
your
receipt
,
formally
.
I
said
I
'd
buy
*NL*
you
up
,
and
so
I
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
out
of
this
,
you
drunken
beast
!
''
cried
Gania
,
who
was
red
and
white
*NL*
by
turns
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rogojin
's
troop
,
who
were
only
waiting
for
an
excuse
,
set
up
a
howl
at
*NL*
this
.
Lebedeff
stepped
forward
and
whispered
something
in
Parfen
's
ear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
right
,
clerk
,
''
said
the
latter
,
``
you
're
right
,
tipsy
*NL*
spirit
--
you
're
right
!
--
Nastasia
Philipovna
,
''
he
added
,
looking
at
her
*NL*
like
some
lunatic
,
harmless
generally
,
but
suddenly
wound
up
to
a
pitch
*NL*
of
audacity
,
``
here
are
eighteen
thousand
roubles
,
and
--
and
you
shall
*NL*
have
more
--
.
''
Here
he
threw
a
packet
of
bank-notes
tied
up
in
white
*NL*
paper
,
on
the
table
before
her
,
not
daring
to
say
all
he
wished
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
no
--
no
!
''
muttered
Lebedeff
,
clutching
at
his
arm
.
He
was
clearly
*NL*
aghast
at
the
largeness
of
the
sum
,
and
thought
a
far
smaller
amount
*NL*
should
have
been
tried
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
you
fool
--
you
do
n't
know
whom
you
are
dealing
with
--
and
it
appears
*NL*
I
am
a
fool
,
too
!
''
said
Parfen
,
trembling
beneath
the
flashing
glance
*NL*
of
Nastasia
.
``
Oh
,
curse
it
all
!
What
a
fool
I
was
to
listen
to
you
!
''
he
*NL*
added
,
with
profound
melancholy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nastasia
Philipovna
,
observing
his
woe-begone
expression
,
suddenly
burst
*NL*
out
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eighteen
thousand
roubles
,
for
me
?
Why
,
you
declare
yourself
a
fool
at
*NL*
once
,
''
she
said
,
with
impudent
familiarity
,
as
she
rose
from
the
sofa
*NL*
and
prepared
to
go
.
Gania
watched
the
whole
scene
with
a
sinking
of
the
*NL*
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forty
thousand
,
then
--
forty
thousand
roubles
instead
of
eighteen
!
*NL*
Ptitsin
and
another
have
promised
to
find
me
forty
thousand
roubles
by
*NL*
seven
o'clock
tonight
.
Forty
thousand
roubles
--
paid
down
on
the
nail
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
scene
was
growing
more
and
more
disgraceful
;
but
Nastasia
Philipovna
*NL*
continued
to
laugh
and
did
not
go
away
.
Nina
Alexandrovna
and
Varia
had
*NL*
both
risen
from
their
places
and
were
waiting
,
in
silent
horror
,
to
*NL*
see
what
would
happen
.
Varia
's
eyes
were
all
ablaze
with
anger
;
but
*NL*
the
scene
had
a
different
effect
on
Nina
Alexandrovna
.
She
paled
and
*NL*
trembled
,
and
looked
more
and
more
like
fainting
every
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
then
,
a
_
hundred
_
thousand
!
a
hundred
thousand
!
paid
this
*NL*
very
day
.
Ptitsin
!
find
it
for
me
.
A
good
share
shall
stick
to
your
*NL*
fingers
--
come
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
mad
!
''
said
Ptitsin
,
coming
up
quickly
and
seizing
him
by
the
*NL*
hand
.
``
You
're
drunk
--
the
police
will
be
sent
for
if
you
do
n't
look
out
.
*NL*
Think
where
you
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
he
's
boasting
like
a
drunkard
,
''
added
Nastasia
,
as
though
with
the
*NL*
sole
intention
of
goading
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
_
not
_
boast
!
You
shall
have
a
hundred
thousand
,
this
very
day
.
*NL*
Ptitsin
,
get
the
money
,
you
gay
usurer
!
Take
what
you
like
for
it
,
but
*NL*
get
it
by
the
evening
!
I
'll
show
that
I
'm
in
earnest
!
''
cried
Rogojin
,
*NL*
working
himself
up
into
a
frenzy
of
excitement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
come
;
what
's
all
this
?
''
cried
General
Ivolgin
,
suddenly
and
*NL*
angrily
,
coming
close
up
to
Rogojin
.
The
unexpectedness
of
this
sally
on
*NL*
the
part
of
the
hitherto
silent
old
man
caused
some
laughter
among
the
*NL*
intruders
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Halloa
!
what
's
this
now
?
''
laughed
Rogojin
.
``
You
come
along
with
me
,
old
*NL*
fellow
!
You
shall
have
as
much
to
drink
as
you
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
's
too
horrible
!
''
cried
poor
Colia
,
sobbing
with
shame
and
*NL*
annoyance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
there
must
be
someone
among
all
of
you
here
who
will
turn
this
*NL*
shameless
creature
out
of
the
room
?
''
cried
Varia
,
suddenly
.
She
was
*NL*
shaking
and
trembling
with
rage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
me
,
I
suppose
.
I
'm
the
shameless
creature
!
''
cried
Nastasia
*NL*
Philipovna
,
with
amused
indifference
.
``
Dear
me
,
and
I
came
--
like
a
fool
,
*NL*
as
I
am
--
to
invite
them
over
to
my
house
for
the
evening
!
Look
how
your
*NL*
sister
treats
me
,
Gavrila
Ardalionovitch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
some
moments
Gania
stood
as
if
stunned
or
struck
by
lightning
,
after
*NL*
his
sister
's
speech
.
But
seeing
that
Nastasia
Philipovna
was
really
*NL*
about
to
leave
the
room
this
time
,
he
sprang
at
Varia
and
seized
her
by
*NL*
the
arm
like
a
madman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
you
done
?
''
he
hissed
,
glaring
at
her
as
though
he
would
like
*NL*
to
annihilate
her
on
the
spot
.
He
was
quite
beside
himself
,
and
could
*NL*
hardly
articulate
his
words
for
rage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
I
done
?
Where
are
you
dragging
me
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
wish
me
to
beg
pardon
of
this
creature
because
she
has
come
here
*NL*
to
insult
our
mother
and
disgrace
the
whole
household
,
you
low
,
base
*NL*
wretch
?
''
cried
Varia
,
looking
back
at
her
brother
with
proud
defiance
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
moments
passed
as
they
stood
there
face
to
face
,
Gania
still
*NL*
holding
her
wrist
tightly
.
Varia
struggled
once
--
twice
--
to
get
free
;
*NL*
then
could
restrain
herself
no
longer
,
and
spat
in
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
a
girl
for
you
!
''
cried
Nastasia
Philipovna
.
``
Mr.
Ptitsin
,
I
*NL*
congratulate
you
on
your
choice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gania
lost
his
head
.
Forgetful
of
everything
he
aimed
a
blow
at
Varia
,
*NL*
which
would
inevitably
have
laid
her
low
,
but
suddenly
another
hand
*NL*
caught
his
.
Between
him
and
Varia
stood
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Enough
--
enough
!
''
said
the
latter
,
with
insistence
,
but
all
of
a
tremble
*NL*
with
excitement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
going
to
cross
my
path
for
ever
,
damn
you
!
''
cried
Gania
;
and
,
*NL*
loosening
his
hold
on
Varia
,
he
slapped
the
prince
's
face
with
all
his
*NL*
force
.
*NL*
*NL*
Exclamations
of
horror
arose
on
all
sides
.
The
prince
grew
pale
as
*NL*
death
;
he
gazed
into
Gania
's
eyes
with
a
strange
,
wild
,
reproachful
*NL*
look
;
his
lips
trembled
and
vainly
endeavoured
to
form
some
words
;
then
*NL*
his
mouth
twisted
into
an
incongruous
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
--
never
mind
about
me
;
but
I
shall
not
allow
you
to
strike
*NL*
her
!
''
he
said
,
at
last
,
quietly
.
Then
,
suddenly
,
he
could
bear
it
no
*NL*
longer
,
and
covering
his
face
with
his
hands
,
turned
to
the
wall
,
and
*NL*
murmured
in
broken
accents
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
how
ashamed
you
will
be
of
this
afterwards
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gania
certainly
did
look
dreadfully
abashed
.
Colia
rushed
up
to
comfort
*NL*
the
prince
,
and
after
him
crowded
Varia
,
Rogojin
and
all
,
even
the
*NL*
general
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
nothing
,
it
's
nothing
!
''
said
the
prince
,
and
again
he
wore
the
*NL*
smile
which
was
so
inconsistent
with
the
circumstances
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
he
will
be
ashamed
!
''
cried
Rogojin
.
``
You
will
be
properly
ashamed
*NL*
of
yourself
for
having
injured
such
a
--
such
a
sheep
''
-LRB-
he
could
not
find
*NL*
a
better
word
-RRB-
.
``
Prince
,
my
dear
fellow
,
leave
this
and
come
away
with
*NL*
me
.
I
'll
show
you
how
Rogojin
shows
his
affection
for
his
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nastasia
Philipovna
was
also
much
impressed
,
both
with
Gania
's
action
*NL*
and
with
the
prince
's
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
usually
thoughtful
,
pale
face
,
which
all
this
while
had
been
so
*NL*
little
in
harmony
with
the
jests
and
laughter
which
she
had
seemed
to
*NL*
put
on
for
the
occasion
,
was
now
evidently
agitated
by
new
feelings
,
*NL*
though
she
tried
to
conceal
the
fact
and
to
look
as
though
she
were
as
*NL*
ready
as
ever
for
jesting
and
irony
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
really
think
I
must
have
seen
him
somewhere
!
''
she
murmured
seriously
*NL*
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
are
n't
you
ashamed
of
yourself
--
are
n't
you
ashamed
?
Are
you
really
*NL*
the
sort
of
woman
you
are
trying
to
represent
yourself
to
be
?
Is
*NL*
it
possible
?
''
The
prince
was
now
addressing
Nastasia
,
in
a
tone
of
*NL*
reproach
,
which
evidently
came
from
his
very
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nastasia
Philipovna
looked
surprised
,
and
smiled
,
but
evidently
*NL*
concealed
something
beneath
her
smile
and
with
some
confusion
and
a
*NL*
glance
at
Gania
she
left
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
she
had
not
reached
the
outer
hall
when
she
turned
round
,
*NL*
walked
quickly
up
to
Nina
Alexandrovna
,
seized
her
hand
and
lifted
it
to
*NL*
her
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
guessed
quite
right
.
I
am
not
that
sort
of
woman
,
''
she
whispered
*NL*
hurriedly
,
flushing
red
all
over
.
Then
she
turned
again
and
left
the
*NL*
room
so
quickly
that
no
one
could
imagine
what
she
had
come
back
for
.
*NL*
All
they
saw
was
that
she
said
something
to
Nina
Alexandrovna
in
a
*NL*
hurried
whisper
,
and
seemed
to
kiss
her
hand
.
Varia
,
however
,
both
saw
*NL*
and
heard
all
,
and
watched
Nastasia
out
of
the
room
with
an
expression
*NL*
of
wonder
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gania
recollected
himself
in
time
to
rush
after
her
in
order
to
show
her
*NL*
out
,
but
she
had
gone
.
He
followed
her
to
the
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
come
with
me
,
''
she
cried
,
''
_
Au
revoir
_
,
till
the
evening
--
do
you
*NL*
hear
?
_
Au
revoir
!
_
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
returned
thoughtful
and
confused
;
the
riddle
lay
heavier
than
ever
on
*NL*
his
soul
.
He
was
troubled
about
the
prince
,
too
,
and
so
bewildered
that
*NL*
he
did
not
even
observe
Rogojin
's
rowdy
band
crowd
past
him
and
step
on
*NL*
his
toes
,
at
the
door
as
they
went
out
.
They
were
all
talking
at
once
.
*NL*
Rogojin
went
ahead
of
the
others
,
talking
to
Ptitsin
,
and
apparently
*NL*
insisting
vehemently
upon
something
very
important
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
lost
the
game
,
Gania
''
he
cried
,
as
he
passed
the
latter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gania
gazed
after
him
uneasily
,
but
said
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
XI
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
now
left
the
room
and
shut
himself
up
in
his
own
chamber
.
*NL*
Colia
followed
him
almost
at
once
,
anxious
to
do
what
he
could
to
*NL*
console
him
.
The
poor
boy
seemed
to
be
already
so
attached
to
him
that
*NL*
he
could
hardly
leave
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
quite
right
to
go
away
!
''
he
said
.
``
The
row
will
rage
there
*NL*
worse
than
ever
now
;
and
it
's
like
this
every
day
with
us
--
and
all
*NL*
through
that
Nastasia
Philipovna
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
so
many
sources
of
trouble
here
,
Colia
,
''
said
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
indeed
,
and
it
is
all
our
own
fault
.
But
I
have
a
great
friend
who
*NL*
is
much
worse
off
even
than
we
are
.
Would
you
like
to
know
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
very
much
.
Is
he
one
of
your
school-fellows
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
not
exactly
.
I
will
tell
you
all
about
him
some
day
...
What
do
*NL*
you
think
of
Nastasia
Philipovna
?
She
is
beautiful
,
is
n't
she
?
I
*NL*
had
never
seen
her
before
,
though
I
had
a
great
wish
to
do
so
.
She
*NL*
fascinated
me
.
I
could
forgive
Gania
if
he
were
to
marry
her
for
love
,
*NL*
but
for
money
!
Oh
dear
!
that
is
horrible
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
your
brother
does
not
attract
me
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
surprised
at
that
.
After
what
you
...
But
I
do
hate
that
way
*NL*
of
looking
at
things
!
Because
some
fool
,
or
a
rogue
pretending
to
be
a
*NL*
fool
,
strikes
a
man
,
that
man
is
to
be
dishonoured
for
his
whole
life
,
*NL*
unless
he
wipes
out
the
disgrace
with
blood
,
or
makes
his
assailant
beg
*NL*
forgiveness
on
his
knees
!
I
think
that
so
very
absurd
and
tyrannical
.
*NL*
Lermontoff
's
Bal
Masque
is
based
on
that
idea
--
a
stupid
and
unnatural
*NL*
one
,
in
my
opinion
;
but
he
was
hardly
more
than
a
child
when
he
wrote
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
your
sister
very
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
see
how
she
spat
in
Gania
's
face

Varia
is
afraid
of
no
one
.
*NL*
But
you
did
not
follow
her
example
,
and
yet
I
am
sure
it
was
not
through
*NL*
cowardice
.
Here
she
comes
!
Speak
of
a
wolf
and
you
see
his
tail
!
I
felt
*NL*
sure
that
she
would
come
.
She
is
very
generous
,
though
of
course
she
has
*NL*
her
faults
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Varia
pounced
upon
her
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
not
the
place
for
you
,

said
she
.
``
Go
to
father

Is
he
plaguing

you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

*NL*
*NL*
``
Scolding
as
usual

It
is
the
worst
thing
about
her

After
all
,
*NL*
I
believe
father
may
have
started
off
with
Rogojin
.
No
doubt
he
is
sorry
*NL*
now
.
Perhaps
I
had
better
go
and
see
what
he
is
doing

''
added
Colia
,
*NL*
running
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
God
,
I
have
got
mother
away
,
and
put
her
to
bed
without
another
*NL*
scene
!
Gania
is
worried
--
and
ashamed
--
not
without
reason
!
What
a
*NL*
spectacle
!
I
have
come
to
thank
you
once
more
,
prince
,
and
to
ask
you
if
*NL*
you
knew
Nastasia
Philipovna
before
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
have
never
known
her

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
what
did
you
mean
,
when
you
said
straight
out
to
her
that
she
was
*NL*
not
really
`
like
that
'
?
You
guessed
right
,
I
fancy
.
It
is
quite
possible
*NL*
she
was
not
herself
at
the
moment
,
though
I
can
not
fathom
her
meaning
.
*NL*
Evidently
she
meant
to
hurt
and
insult
us

I
have
heard
curious
tales
*NL*
about
her
before
now
,
but
if
she
came
to
invite
us
to
her
house
,
why
*NL*
did
she
behave
so
to
my
mother
?
Ptitsin
knows
her
very
well
;
he
says
he
*NL*
could
not
understand
her
today
.
With
Rogojin
,
too
!
No
one
with
a
spark
*NL*
of
self-respect
could
have
talked
like
that
in
the
house
of
her
...
*NL*
Mother
is
extremely
vexed
on
your
account
,
too
...
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
nothing
!

said
the
prince
,
waving
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
meek
she
was
when
you
spoke
to
her
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Meek
!
What
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
told
her
it
was
a
shame
for
her
to
behave
so
,
and
her
manner
*NL*
changed
at
once

she
was
like
another
person

You
have
some
influence
*NL*
over
her

added
Varia
,
smiling
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
opened
at
this
point
,
and
in
came
Gania
most
unexpectedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
not
in
the
least
disconcerted
to
see
Varia
there
,
but
he
stood
a
*NL*
moment
at
the
door
,
and
then
approached
the
prince
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Prince
,
''
he
said
,
with
feeling
,
``
I
was
a
blackguard
.
Forgive
me
!
''
His
*NL*
face
gave
evidence
of
suffering
.
The
prince
was
considerably
amazed
,
*NL*
and
did
not
reply
at
once
.
``
Oh
,
come
,
forgive
me
,
forgive
me
!

Gania
*NL*
insisted
,
rather
impatiently
.
``
If
you
like
,
I
'll
kiss
your
hand
.
There
!

*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
was
touched
;
he
took
Gania
's
hands
,
and
embraced
him
*NL*
heartily
,
while
each
kissed
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
,
never
thought
you
were
like
that

said
Muishkin
,
drawing
a
*NL*
deep
breath
.
``
I
thought
you

you
were
n't
capable
of

*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
what
?
Apologizing
,
eh

And
where
on
earth
did
I
get
the
idea
*NL*
that
you
were
an
idiot
?
You
always
observe
what
other
people
pass
by

unnoticed

one
could
talk
sense
to
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
is
another
to
whom
you
should
apologize

said
the
prince
,
*NL*
pointing
to
Varia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

no

they
are
all
enemies

I
've
tried
them
often
enough

*NL*
me

and
Gania
turned
his
back
on
Varia
with
these
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
I
beg
you
to
make
it
up

Varia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
'll
go
to
Nastasia
Philipovna

this
evening

*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
insist
:
but

judge
for

can
I
go

to
go

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
she
is
not
that
sort
of
woman

I
tell
you
!
''
said
Gania
,
angrily
.
*NL*
``
She
was
only
acting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
that

I
know
that

what
a
part
to
play
!
And
think
what
she
*NL*
must
take
_
you
_
for
,
Gania
!
I
know
she
kissed
mother
's
hand
,
and
all
that
,
*NL*
but
she
laughed
at
you

all
the
same
.
All
this
is
not
good
enough
*NL*
for
seventy-five
thousand
roubles
,
my
dear
boy
.
You
are
capable
of
*NL*
honourable
feelings
still
,

that
's
why
I
am
talking
to
you
so

Oh

*NL*
take

what
you

Do

it
will
end
*NL*
badly

*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
and
in
a
state
of
violent
agitation
,
Varia
left
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There

they
are
all

said
Gania

laughing

just
as

I
do
*NL*
not
know
all
about
it
much
better
than
they
do

*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
down
with
these
words
,
evidently
intending
to
prolong
his
visit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
know
it
so
well

said
the
prince
a
little
timidly
,
``
why
do
you

choose
all
this
worry

the
seventy-five
thousand

you
confess

not
cover
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did

Gania

``
but
while
we
are
upon

hear

all

thousand

not

*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
not

*NL*
*NL*
``
Of

it

A
great
disgrace

Oh

then
you
may
know

certainly
do
it

*NL*
certainly
marry

I
was
not
quite
sure
of
myself
before

now
I

am

Do
n't

a

I
know
what
you
want
to
tell
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I
was
only
going

me
most

your

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
so

What
in

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
Nastasia
Philipovna
will
accept

secondly
,
that
even
if
she
did
,
you
would
be
able
*NL*
to
pocket
the
money
.
Of
course
,
I
know
very
little
about
it
,
but
that
's
*NL*
my
view

When
a
man
marries
for
money
it
often
happens
that
the
wife

keeps
the
money
in
her
own
hands

*NL*
*NL*
``
Of

you

I

*NL*
afraid

it
wo
n't
be
like
that
in

case

There
are
circumstances

*NL*
said
Gania
,
rather
excitedly
.
``
And
as
to
her
answer
to
me

there
's
no
*NL*
doubt
about
that

Why

you
suppose
she
will
refuse
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
only
judge
by
what
I
see

Varvara
Ardalionovna
said
just
now
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
she
--
they
do
n't
know
anything

Nastasia
was
only
chaffing
*NL*
Rogojin

I
was
alarmed
at
first
,
but
I
have
thought
better
of
it
now

*NL*
she
was
simply
laughing
at
him

She
looks
on
me
as
a
fool

I
show
*NL*
that
I
meant
her
money

does
n't
realize
that
there
are
other

I

things
--
and
besides
,
*NL*
I
'm
sure
that
she
is
persuaded
that
I
love
her
to
distraction
,
and
I
*NL*
give
you
my
word
I
have
a
strong
suspicion
that
she
loves
me
,
too
--
in
*NL*
her
own
way
,
of
course
.
She
thinks
she
will
be
able
to
make
a
sort
of
*NL*
slave
of
me
all
my
life
;
but
I
shall
prepare
a
little
surprise
for
her
.
*NL*
I
do
n't
know
whether
I
ought
to
be
confidential
with
you
,
prince
;
but
,
*NL*
I
assure
you
,
you
are
the
only
decent
fellow
I
have
come
across
.
I
have
*NL*
not
spoken
so
sincerely
as
I
am
doing
at
this
moment
for
years
.
There
*NL*
are
uncommonly
few
honest
people
about
,
prince
;
there
is
n't
one
honester
*NL*
than
Ptitsin
,
he
's
the
best
of
the
lot
.
Are
you
laughing
?
You
do
n't
*NL*
know
,
perhaps
,
that
blackguards
like
honest
people
,
and
being
one
myself
*NL*
I
like
you
.
_
Why
_
am
I
a
blackguard
?
Tell
me
honestly
,
now
.
They
all
call
*NL*
me
a
blackguard
because
of
her
,
and
I
have
got
into
the
way
of
thinking
*NL*
myself
one
.
That
's
what
is
so
bad
about
the
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
I
_
for
one
shall
never
think
you
a
blackguard
again
,
''
said
the
prince
.
*NL*
``
I
confess
I
had
a
poor
opinion
of
you
at
first
,
but
I
have
been
so
*NL*
joyfully
surprised
about
you
just
now
;
it
's
a
good
lesson
for
me
.
I
*NL*
shall
never
judge
again
without
a
thorough
trial
.
I
see
now
that
you
are
*NL*
not
only
not
a
blackguard
,
but
are
not
even
quite
spoiled
.
I
see
that
*NL*
you
are
quite
an
ordinary
man
,
not
original
in
the
least
degree
,
but
*NL*
rather
weak
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gania
laughed
sarcastically
,
but
said
nothing
.
The
prince
,
seeing
that
*NL*
he
did
not
quite
like
the
last
remark
,
blushed
,
and
was
silent
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
my
father
asked
you
for
money
?
''
asked
Gania
,
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
give
it
to
him
if
he
does
.
Fancy
,
he
was
a
decent
,
respectable
*NL*
man
once
!
He
was
received
in
the
best
society
;
he
was
not
always
the
*NL*
liar
he
is
now
.
Of
course
,
wine
is
at
the
bottom
of
it
all
;
but
he
is
a
*NL*
good
deal
worse
than
an
innocent
liar
now
.
Do
you
know
that
he
keeps
a
*NL*
mistress
?
I
ca
n't
understand
how
mother
is
so
long-suffering
.
Did
he
*NL*
tell
you
the
story
of
the
siege
of
Kars
?
Or
perhaps
the
one
about
his
*NL*
grey
horse
that
talked
?
He
loves
to
enlarge
on
these
absurd
histories
.
''
*NL*
And
Gania
burst
into
a
fit
of
laughter
.
Suddenly
he
turned
to
the
prince
*NL*
and
asked
:
``
Why
are
you
looking
at
me
like
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
surprised
to
see
you
laugh
in
that
way
,
like
a
child
.
You
came
*NL*
to
make
friends
with
me
again
just
now
,
and
you
said
,
'
I
will
kiss
your
*NL*
hand
,
if
you
like
,
'
just
as
a
child
would
have
said
it
.
And
then
,
all
at
*NL*
once
you
are
talking
of
this
mad
project
--
of
these
seventy-five
thousand
*NL*
roubles
!
It
all
seems
so
absurd
and
impossible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
conclusion
have
you
reached
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
you
are
rushing
madly
into
the
undertaking
,
and
that
you
would
*NL*
do
well
to
think
it
over
again
.
It
is
more
than
possible
that
Varvara
*NL*
Ardalionovna
is
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
now
you
begin
to
moralize
!
I
know
that
I
am
only
a
child
,
very
*NL*
well
,
''
replied
Gania
impatiently
.
``
That
is
proved
by
my
having
this
*NL*
conversation
with
you
.
It
is
not
for
money
only
,
prince
,
that
I
am
*NL*
rushing
into
this
affair
,
''
he
continued
,
hardly
master
of
his
words
,
*NL*
so
closely
had
his
vanity
been
touched
.
``
If
I
reckoned
on
that
I
should
*NL*
certainly
be
deceived
,
for
I
am
still
too
weak
in
mind
and
character
.
*NL*
I
am
obeying
a
passion
,
an
impulse
perhaps
,
because
I
have
but
one
aim
,
*NL*
one
that
overmasters
all
else
.
You
imagine
that
once
I
am
in
possession
*NL*
of
these
seventy-five
thousand
roubles
,
I
shall
rush
to
buy
a
*NL*
carriage
...
No
,
I
shall
go
on
wearing
the
old
overcoat
I
have
worn
for
*NL*
three
years
,
and
I
shall
give
up
my
club
.
I
shall
follow
the
example
of
*NL*
men
who
have
made
their
fortunes
.
When
Ptitsin
was
seventeen
he
slept
*NL*
in
the
street
,
he
sold
pen-knives
,
and
began
with
a
copeck
;
now
he
has
*NL*
sixty
thousand
roubles
,
but
to
get
them
,
what
has
he
not
done
?
Well
,
*NL*
I
shall
be
spared
such
a
hard
beginning
,
and
shall
start
with
a
little
*NL*
capital
.
In
fifteen
years
people
will
say
,
`
Look
,
that
's
Ivolgin
,
the
*NL*
king
of
the
Jews
!
'
You
say
that
I
have
no
originality
.
Now
mark
this
,
*NL*
prince
--
there
is
nothing
so
offensive
to
a
man
of
our
time
and
race
*NL*
than
to
be
told
that
he
is
wanting
in
originality
,
that
he
is
weak
*NL*
in
character
,
has
no
particular
talent
,
and
is
,
in
short
,
an
ordinary
*NL*
person
.
You
have
not
even
done
me
the
honour
of
looking
upon
me
as
a
*NL*
rogue
.
Do
you
know
,
I
could
have
knocked
you
down
for
that
just
now
!
You
*NL*
wounded
me
more
cruelly
than
Epanchin
,
who
thinks
me
capable
of
selling
*NL*
him
my
wife
!
Observe
,
it
was
a
perfectly
gratuitous
idea
on
his
part
,
*NL*
seeing
there
has
never
been
any
discussion
of
it
between
us
!
This
has
*NL*
exasperated
me
,
and
I
am
determined
to
make
a
fortune
!
I
will
do
it
!
*NL*
Once
I
am
rich
,
I
shall
be
a
genius
,
an
extremely
original
man
.
One
of
*NL*
the
vilest
and
most
hateful
things
connected
with
money
is
that
it
can
*NL*
buy
even
talent
;
and
will
do
so
as
long
as
the
world
lasts
.
You
will
say
*NL*
that
this
is
childish
--
or
romantic
.
Well
,
that
will
be
all
the
better
*NL*
for
me
,
but
the
thing
shall
be
done
.
I
will
carry
it
through
.
He
laughs
*NL*
most
,
who
laughs
last
.
Why
does
Epanchin
insult
me
?
Simply
because
,
*NL*
socially
,
I
am
a
nobody
.
However
,
enough
for
the
present
.
Colia
has
put
*NL*
his
nose
in
to
tell
us
dinner
is
ready
,
twice
.
I
'm
dining
out
.
I
shall
*NL*
come
and
talk
to
you
now
and
then
;
you
shall
be
comfortable
enough
with
*NL*
us
.
They
are
sure
to
make
you
one
of
the
family
.
I
think
you
and
I
*NL*
will
either
be
great
friends
or
enemies
.
Look
here
now
,
supposing
I
had
*NL*
kissed
your
hand
just
now
,
as
I
offered
to
do
in
all
sincerity
,
should
I
*NL*
have
hated
you
for
it
afterwards
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
but
not
always
.
You
would
not
have
been
able
to
keep
it
up
,
*NL*
and
would
have
ended
by
forgiving
me
,
''
said
the
prince
,
after
a
pause
*NL*
for
reflection
,
and
with
a
pleasant
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oho
,
how
careful
one
has
to
be
with
you
,
prince
!
Have
n't
you
put
a
drop
*NL*
of
poison
in
that
remark
now
,
eh
?
By
the
way
--
ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
--
I
forgot
to
*NL*
ask
,
was
I
right
in
believing
that
you
were
a
good
deal
struck
yourself
*NL*
with
Nastasia
Philipovna

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye-yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
in
love
with
her
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
N-no

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
you
flush
up
as
red
as
a
rosebud
!
Come
--
it
's
all
right
.
I
'm
not
*NL*
going
to
laugh
at
you
.
Do
you
know
she
is
a
very
virtuous
woman
?
Believe
*NL*
it
or
not
,
as
you
like
.
You
think
she
and
Totski
--
not
a
bit
of
it
,
not
a
*NL*
bit
of
it
!
Not
for
ever
so
long
!
_
Au
revoir
!

''
*NL*
*NL*
Gania
left
the
room
in
great
good
humour
.
The
prince
stayed
behind
,
and
*NL*
meditated
alone
for
a
few
minutes
.
At
length
,
Colia
popped
his
head
in
*NL*
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
any
dinner
,
thanks
,
Colia

I
had
too
good
a
lunch
at
*NL*
General
Epanchin
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Colia
came
into
the
room
and
gave
the
prince
a
note
;
it
was
from
the
*NL*
general
and
was
carefully
sealed
up
.
It
was
clear
from
Colia
's
face
how
*NL*
painful
it
was
to
him
to
deliver
the
missive
.
The
prince
read
it
,
rose
,
*NL*
and
took
his
hat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
only
a
couple
of
yards
,
''
said
Colia
,
blushing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
sitting
there
over
his
bottle
--
and
how
they
can
give
him
credit

I
can
not
understand
.
Do
n't
tell
mother
I
brought
you
the
note

prince

*NL*
I
have
sworn
not
to
do
it
a
thousand
times
,
but
I
'm
always
so
sorry
for
*NL*
him
.
Do
n't
stand
on
ceremony
,
give
him
some
trifle

and
let
that
end
*NL*
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
along
,
Colia
,
I
want
to
see
your
father

I
have
an
idea

said
the
*NL*
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
XII
.
*NL*
*NL*
Colia
took
the
prince
to
a
public-house
in
the
Litaynaya
,
not
far
off
.
*NL*
In
one
of
the
side
rooms
there
sat
at
a
table
--
looking
like
one
of
the
*NL*
regular
guests
of
the
establishment
--
Ardalion
Alexandrovitch
,
with
a
*NL*
bottle
before
him
,
and
a
newspaper
on
his
knee
.
He
was
waiting
for
*NL*
the
prince
,
and
no
sooner
did
the
latter
appear
than
he
began
a
long
*NL*
harangue
about
something
or
other
;
but
so
far
gone
was
he
that
the
*NL*
prince
could
hardly
understand
a
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
got
a
ten-rouble
note

said
the
prince
;
``
but
here
is
a
*NL*
twenty-five

Change
it

give
me
back
the
fifteen

left

*NL*
``
I

Often

only
pretended
I

had
not
in
order
to
avoid
a
painful
subject

You
saw
today
,
you
were
a
*NL*
witness
,
that
I
did
all
that
a
kind

an
indulgent
father
could
do

Now
*NL*
a
father
of
altogether
another
type
shall
step
into
the
scene

You
shall
*NL*
see
;
the
old
soldier
shall
lay
bare
this
intrigue

a
shameless
woman
*NL*
will
force
her
way
into
a
respectable

noble
family

*NL*
``
Yes

must
go

have
business

pocketed
the

at

point
-RRB-
,
``
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

a
long
way
off

near
the
Great
Theatre

just
in

square

there

It
wo
n't
be
a
large
party

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
general
sat
on
and
on
.
He
had
ordered
a
fresh
bottle
when
the
prince
*NL*
arrived
;
this
took
him
an
hour
to
drink
,
and
then
he
had
another
,
and
*NL*
another
,
during
the
consumption
of
which
he
told
pretty
nearly
the
whole
*NL*
story
of
his
life
.
The
prince
was
in
despair
.
He
felt
that
though
he
had
*NL*
but
applied
to
this
miserable
old
drunkard
because
he
saw
no
other
way
*NL*
of
getting
to
Nastasia
Philipovna
's
,
yet
he
had
been
very
wrong
to
put
*NL*
the
slightest
confidence
in
such
a
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
he
rose
and
declared
that
he
would
wait
no
longer
.
The
general
*NL*
rose
too
,
drank
the
last
drops
that
he
could
squeeze
out
of
the
bottle
,
*NL*
and
staggered
into
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
Muishkin
began
to
despair
.
He
could
not
imagine
how
he
had
been
so
*NL*
foolish
as
to
trust
this
man
.
He
only
wanted
one
thing
,
and
that
was
to
*NL*
get
to
Nastasia
Philipovna
's
,
even
at
the
cost
of
a
certain
amount
*NL*
of
impropriety
.
But
now
the
scandal
threatened
to
be
more
than
he
*NL*
had
bargained
for
.
By
this
time
Ardalion
Alexandrovitch
was
quite
*NL*
intoxicated
,
and
he
kept
his
companion
listening
while
he
discoursed
*NL*
eloquently
and
pathetically
on
subjects
of
all
kinds
,
interspersed
with
*NL*
torrents
of
recrimination
against
the
members
of
his
family
.
He
insisted
*NL*
that
all
his
troubles
were
caused
by
their
bad
conduct
,
and
time
alone
*NL*
would
put
an
end
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
they
reached
the
Litaynaya
.
The
thaw
increased
steadily
,
a
warm
,
*NL*
unhealthy
wind
blew
through
the
streets
,
vehicles
splashed
through
the
*NL*
mud
,
and
the
iron
shoes
of
horses
and
mules
rang
on
the
paving
stones
.
*NL*
Crowds
of
melancholy
people
plodded
wearily
along
the
footpaths
,
with
*NL*
here
and
there
a
drunken
man
among
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
see
those
brightly-lighted
windows
?
''
said
the
general
.
``
Many
of
*NL*
my
old
comrades-in-arms
live
about
here
,
and
I
,
who
served
longer
,
and
*NL*
suffered
more
than
any
of
them
,
am
walking
on
foot
to
the
house
of
*NL*
a
woman
of
rather
questionable
reputation
!
A
man
,
look
you
,
who
has
*NL*
thirteen
bullets
on
his
breast
!
...
You
do
n't
believe
it
?
Well
,
I
can
*NL*
assure
you
it
was
entirely
on
my
account
that
Pirogoff
telegraphed
*NL*
to
Paris
,
and
left
Sebastopol
at
the
greatest
risk
during
the
siege
.
*NL*
Nelaton
,
the
Tuileries
surgeon
,
demanded
a
safe
conduct
,
in
the
name
*NL*
of
science
,
into
the
besieged
city
in
order
to
attend
my
wounds
.
The
*NL*
government
knows
all
about
it
.
`
That
's
the
Ivolgin
with
thirteen
bullets
*NL*
in
him
!
'
That
's
how
they
speak
of
me
...
Do
you
see
that
house
,
prince
?
*NL*
One
of
my
old
friends
lives
on
the
first
floor
,
with
his
large
family
.
*NL*
In
this
and
five
other
houses
,
three
overlooking
Nevsky
,
two
in
the
*NL*
Morskaya
,
are
all
that
remain
of
my
personal
friends
.
Nina
Alexandrovna
*NL*
gave
them
up
long
ago
,
but
I
keep
in
touch
with
them
still
...
I
may
*NL*
say
I
find
refreshment
in
this
little
coterie
,
in
thus
meeting
my
old
*NL*
acquaintances
and
subordinates
,
who
worship
me
still
,
in
spite
of
all
.
*NL*
General
Sokolovitch
-LRB-
by
the
way
,
I
have
not
called
on
him
lately
,
or
*NL*
seen
Anna
Fedorovna
-RRB-
...
You
know
,
my
dear
prince
,
when
a
person
does
*NL*
not
receive
company
himself
,
he
gives
up
going
to
other
people
's
houses
*NL*
involuntarily
.
And
yet
...
well
...
you
look
as
if
you
did
n't
believe
*NL*
me
...
Well
now
,
why
should
I
not
present
the
son
of
my
old
friend
*NL*
and
companion
to
this
delightful
family
--
General
Ivolgin
and
Prince
*NL*
Muishkin
?
You
will
see
a
lovely
girl
--
what
am
I
saying
--
a
lovely
girl
?
*NL*
No
,
indeed
,
two
,
three
!
Ornaments
of
this
city
and
of
society
:
beauty
,
*NL*
education
,
culture
--
the
woman
question
--
poetry
--
everything
!
Added
to
*NL*
which
is
the
fact
that
each
one
will
have
a
dot
of
at
least
eighty
*NL*
thousand
roubles
.
No
bad
thing
,
eh
?
...
In
a
word
I
absolutely
must
*NL*
introduce
you
to
them
:
it
is
a
duty
,
an
obligation
.
General
Ivolgin
and
*NL*
Prince
Muishkin
.
Tableau
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
once
?
Now
?
You
must
have
forgotten
...
''
began
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
have
forgotten
nothing
.
Come
!
This
is
the
house
--
up
this
*NL*
magnificent
staircase
.
I
am
surprised
not
to
see
the
porter
,
but
...
it
*NL*
is
a
holiday
...
and
the
man
has
gone
off
...
Drunken
fool
!
Why
have
they
*NL*
not
got
rid
of
him
?
Sokolovitch
owes
all
the
happiness
he
has
had
in
*NL*
the
service
and
in
his
private
life
to
me
,
and
me
alone
,
but
...
here
we
*NL*
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
followed
quietly
,
making
no
further
objection
for
fear
of
*NL*
irritating
the
old
man
.
At
the
same
time
he
fervently
hoped
that
General
*NL*
Sokolovitch
and
his
family
would
fade
away
like
a
mirage
in
the
desert
,
*NL*
so
that
the
visitors
could
escape
,
by
merely
returning
downstairs
.
But
*NL*
to
his
horror
he
saw
that
General
Ivolgin
was
quite
familiar
with
the
*NL*
house
,
and
really
seemed
to
have
friends
there
.
At
every
step
he
named
*NL*
some
topographical
or
biographical
detail
that
left
nothing
to
be
*NL*
desired
on
the
score
of
accuracy
.
When
they
arrived
at
last
,
on
the
*NL*
first
floor
,
and
the
general
turned
to
ring
the
bell
to
the
right
,
*NL*
the
prince
decided
to
run
away
,
but
a
curious
incident
stopped
him
*NL*
momentarily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
made
a
mistake
,
general
,
''
said
he
.
``
The
name
on
the
door
is
*NL*
Koulakoff
,
and
you
were
going
to
see
General
Sokolovitch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Koulakoff
...
Koulakoff
means
nothing
.
This
is
Sokolovitch
's
flat
,
and
*NL*
I
am
ringing
at
his
door
...
What
do
I
care
for
Koulakoff
?
...
Here
comes
*NL*
someone
to
open
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
,
the
door
opened
directly
,
and
the
footman
informed
the
*NL*
visitors
that
the
family
were
all
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
pity
!
What
a
pity
!
It
's
just
my
luck
!
''
repeated
Ardalion
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
over
and
over
again
,
in
regretful
tones
.
``
When
your
*NL*
master
and
mistress
return
,
my
man
,
tell
them
that
General
Ivolgin
*NL*
and
Prince
Muishkin
desired
to
present
themselves
,
and
that
they
were
*NL*
extremely
sorry
,
excessively
grieved
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Just
then
another
person
belonging
to
the
household
was
seen
at
the
*NL*
back
of
the
hall
.
It
was
a
woman
of
some
forty
years
,
dressed
in
sombre
*NL*
colours
,
probably
a
housekeeper
or
a
governess
.
Hearing
the
names
she
*NL*
came
forward
with
a
look
of
suspicion
on
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marie
Alexandrovna
is
not
at
home
,
''
said
she
,
staring
hard
at
the
*NL*
general
.
``
She
has
gone
to
her
mother
's
,
with
Alexandra
Michailovna
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alexandra
Michailovna
out
,
too
!
How
disappointing
!
Would
you
believe
*NL*
it
,
I
am
always
so
unfortunate
!
May
I
most
respectfully
ask
you
to
*NL*
present
my
compliments
to
Alexandra
Michailovna
,
and
remind
her
...
tell
*NL*
her
,
that
with
my
whole
heart
I
wish
for
her
what
she
wished
for
herself
*NL*
on
Thursday
evening
,
while
she
was
listening
to
Chopin
's
Ballade
.
She
*NL*
will
remember
.
I
wish
it
with
all
sincerity
.
General
Ivolgin
and
Prince
*NL*
Muishkin
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
's
face
changed
;
she
lost
her
suspicious
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not
fail
to
deliver
your
message
,
''
she
replied
,
and
bowed
them
*NL*
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
went
downstairs
the
general
regretted
repeatedly
that
he
had
*NL*
failed
to
introduce
the
prince
to
his
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
I
am
a
bit
of
a
poet
,
''
said
he
.
``
Have
you
noticed
it
?
The
*NL*
poetic
soul
,
you
know
.
''
Then
he
added
suddenly
--
``
But
after
all
...
*NL*
after
all
I
believe
we
made
a
mistake
this
time
!
I
remember
that
the
*NL*
Sokolovitch
's
live
in
another
house
,
and
what
is
more
,
they
are
just
*NL*
now
in
Moscow
.
Yes
,
I
certainly
was
at
fault
.
However
,
it
is
of
no
*NL*
consequence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
tell
me
,
''
said
the
prince
in
reply
,
``
may
I
count
still
on
your
*NL*
assistance
?
Or
shall
I
go
on
alone
to
see
Nastasia
Philipovna
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Count
on
my
assistance
?
Go
alone

How
can
you
ask
me
that
question
,
*NL*
when
it
is
a
matter
on
which
the
fate
of
my
family
so
largely
depends
?
*NL*
You
do
n't
know
Ivolgin
,
my
friend
.
To
trust
Ivolgin
is
to
trust
a
rock
;
*NL*
that
's
how
the
first
squadron
I
commanded
spoke
of
me
.
`
Depend
upon
*NL*
Ivolgin
,

said
they
all
,
`
he
is
as
steady
as
a
rock

But
,
excuse
me
,
*NL*
I
must
just
call
at
a
house
on
our
way
,
a
house
where
I
have
found
*NL*
consolation
and
help
in
all
my
trials
for
years

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
going
home

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I
wish

to
visit
Madame
Terentieff
,
the
widow
of
Captain
*NL*
Terentieff
,
my
old
subordinate
and
friend
.
She
helps
me
to
keep
up
my
*NL*
courage
,
and
to
bear
the
trials
of
my
domestic
life
,
and
as
I
have
an
*NL*
extra
burden
on
my
mind
today
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
to
me
,
''
interrupted
the
prince
,
``
that
I
was
foolish
to
trouble
*NL*
you
just
now
.
However
,
at
present
you
...
Good-bye
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
you
must
not
go
away
like
that
,
young
man
,
you
must
not
!
''
cried
*NL*
the
general
.
``
My
friend
here
is
a
widow
,
the
mother
of
a
family
;
her
*NL*
words
come
straight
from
her
heart
,
and
find
an
echo
in
mine
.
A
visit
*NL*
to
her
is
merely
an
affair
of
a
few
minutes
;
I
am
quite
at
home
in
her
*NL*
house
.
I
will
have
a
wash
,
and
dress
,
and
then
we
can
drive
to
the
Grand
*NL*
Theatre

Make
up
your
mind
to
spend
the
evening
with
me

We
are
*NL*
just
there

Why

you
here

Well

is
Marfa
*NL*
Borisovna
at
home
or
have
you
only
just
come

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no

I
have
been
here
a
long
while

replied
Colia
,
who
was
at
the
*NL*
front
door
when
the
general
met
him
.
``
I
am
keeping
Hippolyte
company
.
*NL*
He
is
worse
,
and
has
been
in
bed
all
day

I
came
down
to
buy
some
cards
.
*NL*
Marfa
Borisovna
expects
you
.
But
what
a
state
you
are
in
,
father
!
''
added
*NL*
the
boy
,
noticing
his
father
's
unsteady
gait
.
``
Well
,
let
us
go
in

''
*NL*
*NL*
On
meeting
Colia
the
prince
determined
to
accompany
the
general
,
though
*NL*
he
made
up
his
mind
to
stay
as
short
a
time
as
possible
.
He
wanted
*NL*
Colia
,
but
firmly
resolved
to
leave
the
general
behind
.
He
could
not
*NL*
forgive
himself
for
being
so
simple
as
to
imagine
that
Ivolgin
would
be
*NL*
of
any
use
.
The
three
climbed
up
the
long
staircase
until
they
reached
*NL*
the
fourth
floor
where
Madame
Terentieff
lived
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
intend
to
introduce
the
prince
?
''
asked
Colia
,
as
they
went
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
boy
.
I
wish
to
present
him

General
Ivolgin

Prince
*NL*
Muishkin

But
what
's
the
matter

what

How
is
Marfa
Borisovna
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

you
would
have
done

ready
to
eat
you
up
!
You
have
not
shown
yourself
since
the
day
*NL*
before
yesterday
and
she
is
expecting
the
money
.
Why
did
you
promise
her
*NL*
any
?
You
are
always
the
same
!
Well
,
now
you
will
have
to
get
out
of
it
*NL*
as
best
you
can

''
*NL*
*NL*
They
stopped
before
a
somewhat
low
doorway
on
the
fourth
floor
.
Ardalion
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
,
evidently
much
out
of
countenance
,
pushed
Muishkin
in
*NL*
front
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
wait
here
,
''
he
stammered
.
``
I
should
like
to
surprise
her
.
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Colia
entered
first
,
and
as
the
door
stood
open
,
the
mistress
of
the
*NL*
house
peeped
out
.
The
surprise
of
the
general
's
imagination
fell
very
*NL*
flat
,
for
she
at
once
began
to
address
him
in
terms
of
reproach
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marfa
Borisovna
was
about
forty
years
of
age
.
She
wore
a
*NL*
dressing-jacket
,
her
feet
were
in
slippers
,
her
face
painted
,
and
her
*NL*
hair
was
in
dozens
of
small
plaits
.
No
sooner
did
she
catch
sight
of
*NL*
Ardalion
Alexandrovitch
than
she
screamed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
he
is
,
that
wicked
,
mean
wretch
!
I
knew
it
was
he
!
My
heart
*NL*
misgave
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
tried
to
put
a
good
face
on
the
affair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
let
us
go
in
--
it
's
all
right
,
''
he
whispered
in
the
prince
's
ear
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
more
serious
than
he
wished
to
think
.
As
soon
as
the
visitors
*NL*
had
crossed
the
low
dark
hall
,
and
entered
the
narrow
reception-room
,
*NL*
furnished
with
half
a
dozen
cane
chairs
,
and
two
small
card-tables
,
*NL*
Madame
Terentieff
,
in
the
shrill
tones
habitual
to
her
,
continued
her
*NL*
stream
of
invectives
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
not
ashamed
?
Are
you
not
ashamed

You
barbarian
!
You
tyrant

*NL*
You
have
robbed
me
of
all
I
possessed

you
have
sucked
my
bones
to
the
*NL*
marrow

How
long
shall
I
be
your
victim

dishonourable
man

stammered
the
disconcerted
old
*NL*
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
believe

said
the
mistress
of
the
house
,
suddenly
addressing
*NL*
the
prince
,
``
would
you

*NL*
your
IOU
's
,
you
cunning
,
unscrupulous
rogue
?
Answer
,
devourer
!
answer
,
*NL*
heart
of
stone
!
How
shall
I
feed
my
orphans
?
with
what
shall
I
nourish
*NL*
them
?
And
now
he
has
come
,
he
is
drunk
!
He
can
scarcely
stand
.
How
,
oh
*NL*
how
,
have
I
offended
the
Almighty
,
that
He
should
bring
this
curse
upon
*NL*
me
!
Answer
,
you
worthless
villain
,
answer
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
was
too
much
for
the
general
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
are
twenty-five
roubles
,
Marfa
Borisovna
...
it
is
all
that
I
*NL*
can
give
...
and
I
owe
even
these
to
the
prince
's
generosity
--
my
noble
*NL*
friend
.
I
have
been
cruelly
deceived
.
Such
is
...
life
...
Now
...
Excuse
*NL*
me
,
I
am
very
weak
,
''
he
continued
,
standing
in
the
centre
of
the
*NL*
room
,
and
bowing
to
all
sides
.
``
I
am
faint
;
excuse
me
!
Lenotchka
...
a
*NL*
cushion
...
my
dear
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lenotchka
,
a
little
girl
of
eight
,
ran
to
fetch
the
cushion
at
once
,
and
*NL*
placed
it
on
the
rickety
old
sofa
.
The
general
meant
to
have
said
much
*NL*
more
,
but
as
soon
as
he
had
stretched
himself
out
,
he
turned
his
face
to
*NL*
the
wall
,
and
slept
the
sleep
of
the
just
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
grave
and
ceremonious
air
,
Marfa
Borisovna
motioned
the
prince
to
*NL*
a
chair
at
one
of
the
card-tables
.
She
seated
herself
opposite
,
leaned
*NL*
her
right
cheek
on
her
hand
,
and
sat
in
silence
,
her
eyes
fixed
on
*NL*
Muishkin
,
now
and
again
sighing
deeply
.
The
three
children
,
two
little
*NL*
girls
and
a
boy
,
Lenotchka
being
the
eldest
,
came
and
leant
on
the
*NL*
table
and
also
stared
steadily
at
him
.
Presently
Colia
appeared
from
the
*NL*
adjoining
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
glad
indeed
to
have
met
you
here
,
Colia
,
''
said
the
prince
.
*NL*
``
Can
you
do
something
for
me
?
I
must
see
Nastasia
Philipovna
,
and
I
*NL*
asked
Ardalion
Alexandrovitch
just
now
to
take
me
to
her
house
,
but
he
*NL*
has
gone
to
sleep
,
as
you
see
.
Will
you
show
me
the
way
,
for
I
do
not
*NL*
know
the
street
?
I
have
the
address
,
though
;
it
is
close
to
the
Grand
*NL*
Theatre
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nastasia
Philipovna
?
She
does
not
live
there
,
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
*NL*
my
father
has
never
been
to
her
house
!
It
is
strange
that
you
should
*NL*
have
depended
on
him
!
She
lives
near
Wladimir
Street
,
at
the
Five
*NL*
Corners
,
and
it
is
quite
close
by
.
Will
you
go
directly
?
It
is
just
*NL*
half-past
nine
.
I
will
show
you
the
way
with
pleasure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Colia
and
the
prince
went
off
together
.
Alas
!
the
latter
had
no
money
to
*NL*
pay
for
a
cab
,
so
they
were
obliged
to
walk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
have
liked
to
have
taken
you
to
see
Hippolyte
,
''
said
Colia
.
*NL*
``
He
is
the
eldest
son
of
the
lady
you
met
just
now
,
and
was
in
the
next
*NL*
room
.
He
is
ill
,
and
has
been
in
bed
all
day
.
But
he
is
rather
strange
,
*NL*
and
extremely
sensitive
,
and
I
thought
he
might
be
upset
considering
*NL*
the
circumstances
in
which
you
came
...
Somehow
it
touches
me
less
,
as
*NL*
it
concerns
my
father
,
while
it
is
_
his
_
mother
.
That
,
of
course
,
makes
*NL*
a
great
difference
.
What
is
a
terrible
disgrace
to
a
woman
,
does
not
*NL*
disgrace
a
man
,
at
least
not
in
the
same
way
.
Perhaps
public
opinion
*NL*
is
wrong
in
condemning
one
sex
,
and
excusing
the
other
.
Hippolyte
is
*NL*
an
extremely
clever
boy
,
but
so
prejudiced
.
He
is
really
a
slave
to
his
*NL*
opinions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
say
he
is
consumptive
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
It
really
would
be
happier
for
him
to
die
young
.
If
I
were
in
his
*NL*
place
I
should
certainly
long
for
death
.
He
is
unhappy
about
his
brother
*NL*
and
sisters
,
the
children
you
saw
.
If
it
were
possible
,
if
we
only
had
a
*NL*
little
money
,
we
should
leave
our
respective
families
,
and
live
together
*NL*
in
a
little
apartment
of
our
own
.
It
is
our
dream
.
But
,
do
you
know
,
*NL*
when
I
was
talking
over
your
affair
with
him
,
he
was
angry
,
and
said
*NL*
that
anyone
who
did
not
call
out
a
man
who
had
given
him
a
blow
was
a
*NL*
coward
.
He
is
very
irritable
to-day
,
and
I
left
off
arguing
the
matter
*NL*
with
him
.
So
Nastasia
Philipovna
has
invited
you
to
go
and
see
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
tell
the
truth
,
she
has
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
how
do
you
come
to
be
going
there
?
''
cried
Colia
,
so
much
*NL*
astonished
that
he
stopped
short
in
the
middle
of
the
pavement
.
``
And
...
*NL*
and
are
you
going
to
her
`
At
Home
'
in
that
costume
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
really
,
whether
I
shall
be
allowed
in
at
all
.
If
she
will
*NL*
receive
me
,
so
much
the
better
.
If
not
,
the
matter
is
ended
.
As
to
my
*NL*
clothes
--
what
can
I
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
going
there
for
some
particular
reason
,
or
only
as
a
way
of
*NL*
getting
into
her
society
,
and
that
of
her
friends
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
have
really
an
object
in
going
...
That
is
,
I
am
going
on
business
*NL*
it
is
difficult
to
explain
,
but
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
whether
you
go
on
business
or
not
is
your
affair
,
I
do
not
want
*NL*
to
know
.
The
only
important
thing
,
in
my
eyes
,
is
that
you
should
not
*NL*
be
going
there
simply
for
the
pleasure
of
spending
your
evening
in
such
*NL*
company
--
cocottes
,
generals
,
usurers
!
If
that
were
the
case
I
should
*NL*
despise
and
laugh
at
you
.
There
are
terribly
few
honest
people
here
,
*NL*
and
hardly
any
whom
one
can
respect
,
although
people
put
on
airs
--
Varia
*NL*
especially
!
Have
you
noticed
,
prince
,
how
many
adventurers
there
are
*NL*
nowadays
?
Especially
here
,
in
our
dear
Russia
.
How
it
has
happened
I
*NL*
never
can
understand
.
There
used
to
be
a
certain
amount
of
solidity
in
*NL*
all
things
,
but
now
what
happens
?
Everything
is
exposed
to
the
public
*NL*
gaze
,
veils
are
thrown
back
,
every
wound
is
probed
by
careless
fingers
.
*NL*
We
are
for
ever
present
at
an
orgy
of
scandalous
revelations
.
Parents
*NL*
blush
when
they
remember
their
old-fashioned
morality
.
At
Moscow
lately
*NL*
a
father
was
heard
urging
his
son
to
stop
at
nothing
--
at
nothing
,
mind
*NL*
you
!
--
to
get
money
!
The
press
seized
upon
the
story
,
of
course
,
and
now
*NL*
it
is
public
property
.
Look
at
my
father
,
the
general
!
See
what
he
is
,
*NL*
and
yet
,
I
assure
you
,
he
is
an
honest
man
!
Only
...
he
drinks
too
much
,
*NL*
and
his
morals
are
not
all
we
could
desire
.
Yes
,
that
's
true
!
I
pity
*NL*
him
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
but
I
dare
not
say
so
,
because
everybody
would
*NL*
laugh
at
me
--
but
I
do
pity
him
!
And
who
are
the
really
clever
men
,
after
*NL*
all
?
Money-grubbers
,
every
one
of
them
,
from
the
first
to
the
last
.
*NL*
Hippolyte
finds
excuses
for
money-lending
,
and
says
it
is
a
necessity
.
*NL*
He
talks
about
the
economic
movement
,
and
the
ebb
and
flow
of
capital
;
*NL*
the
devil
knows
what
he
means
.
It
makes
me
angry
to
hear
him
talk
so
,
*NL*
but
he
is
soured
by
his
troubles
.
Just
imagine-the
general
keeps
his
*NL*
mother-but
she
lends
him
money
!
She
lends
it
for
a
week
or
ten
days
*NL*
at
very
high
interest
!
Is
n't
it
disgusting
?
And
then
,
you
would
hardly
*NL*
believe
it
,
but
my
mother
--
Nina
Alexandrovna
--
helps
Hippolyte
in
all
*NL*
sorts
of
ways
,
sends
him
money
and
clothes
.
She
even
goes
as
far
as
*NL*
helping
the
children
,
through
Hippolyte
,
because
their
mother
cares
*NL*
nothing
about
them
,
and
Varia
does
the
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
just
now
you
said
there
were
no
honest
nor
good
people
about
,
*NL*
that
there
were
only
money-grubbers
--
and
here
they
are
quite
close
at
*NL*
hand
,
these
honest
and
good
people
,
your
mother
and
Varia
!
I
think
*NL*
there
is
a
good
deal
of
moral
strength
in
helping
people
in
such
*NL*
circumstances
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Varia
does
it
from
pride
,
and
likes
showing
off
,
and
giving
herself
*NL*
airs
.
As
to
my
mother
,
I
really
do
admire
her
--
yes
,
and
honour
her
.
*NL*
Hippolyte
,
hardened
as
he
is
,
feels
it
.
He
laughed
at
first
,
and
thought
*NL*
it
vulgar
of
her
--
but
now
,
he
is
sometimes
quite
touched
and
overcome
by
*NL*
her
kindness
.
H
'm
!
You
call
that
being
strong
and
good
?
I
will
remember
*NL*
that
!
Gania
knows
nothing
about
it
.
He
would
say
that
it
was
encouraging
*NL*
vice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Gania
knows
nothing
about
it

It
seems
there
are
many
things
that
*NL*
Gania
does
not
know

exclaimed
the
prince
,
as
he
considered
Colia
's
*NL*
last
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
I
like
you
very
much
indeed

I
shall
never
forget
*NL*
about

afternoon

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like

*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
to
me
!
You
are
going
to
live
here

you
not
?

said
Colia
.
*NL*
``
I
mean
to
get
something
to
do
directly
,
and
earn
money
.
Then
shall
we
*NL*
three
live
together

You
,
and
I
,
and
Hippolyte
?
We
will
hire
a
flat
,
and
*NL*
let
the
general
come
and
visit
us
.
What
do
you
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
very
pleasant
,
''
returned
the
prince
.
``
But
we
must
see

I
am
*NL*
really
rather
worried
just
now

What

there
already

Is
that
the
*NL*
house
?
What
a
long
flight
of
steps
!
And
there
's
a
porter

Well
,
Colia
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
what
will
come
of
it
all

*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
seemed
quite
distracted
for
the
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
tell
me
all
about
it
tomorrow

Do
n't
be
afraid

wish
you

agree
so
entirely

that
can
do
so

I
do
not

understand
why
you
are
here

Good-bye

cried
Colia
excitedly
.
``
Now
I
*NL*
will
rush
back
and
tell
Hippolyte
all
about
our
plans
and

*NL*
as
to
your
getting
in
--
do
n't
be
in
the
least
afraid
.

will
see
her

*NL*

is
so
original
about
everything

It
's
the
first
floor
.
The
porter
*NL*
will
show
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
XIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
was
very
nervous
as
he
reached
the
outer
door
;
but
he
did
his
*NL*
best
to
encourage
himself
with
the
reflection
that
the
worst
thing
that
*NL*
could
happen
to
him
would
be
that
he
would
not
be
received
,
or
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
received
,
then
laughed
at
for
coming
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
was
another
question
,
which
terrified
him
considerably
,
*NL*
and
that
was
:
what
was
he
going
to
do
when
he
_
did
_
get
in
?
And
to
this
*NL*
question
he
could
fashion
no
satisfactory
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
only
he
could
find
an
opportunity
of
coming
close
up
to
Nastasia
*NL*
Philipovna
and
saying
to
her
:
``
Do
n't
ruin
yourself
by
marrying
this
man
.
*NL*
He
does
not
love
you
,
he
only
loves
your
money
.
He
told
me
so
himself
,
*NL*
and
so
did
Aglaya
Ivanovna
,
and
I
have
come
on
purpose
to
warn
you
''
--
but
*NL*
even
that
did
not
seem
quite
a
legitimate
or
practicable
thing
to
do
.
*NL*
Then
,
again
,
there
was
another
delicate
question
,
to
which
he
could
not
*NL*
find
an
answer
;
dared
not
,
in
fact
,
think
of
it
;
but
at
the
very
idea
*NL*
of
which
he
trembled
and
blushed
.
However
,
in
spite
of
all
his
fears
and
*NL*
heart-quakings
he
went
in
,
and
asked
for
Nastasia
Philipovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nastasia
occupied
a
medium-sized
,
but
distinctly
tasteful
,
flat
,
*NL*
beautifully
furnished
and
arranged
.
At
one
period
of
these
five
years
*NL*
of
Petersburg
life
,
Totski
had
certainly
not
spared
his
expenditure
upon
*NL*
her
.
He
had
calculated
upon
her
eventual
love
,
and
tried
to
tempt
her
*NL*
with
a
lavish
outlay
upon
comforts
and
luxuries
,
knowing
too
well
how
*NL*
easily
the
heart
accustoms
itself
to
comforts
,
and
how
difficult
it
is
*NL*
to
tear
one
's
self
away
from
luxuries
which
have
become
habitual
and
,
*NL*
little
by
little
,
indispensable
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nastasia
did
not
reject
all
this
,
she
even
loved
her
comforts
and
*NL*
luxuries
,
but
,
strangely
enough
,
never
became
,
in
the
least
degree
,
*NL*
dependent
upon
them
,
and
always
gave
the
impression
that
she
could
do
*NL*
just
as
well
without
them
.
In
fact
,
she
went
so
far
as
to
inform
Totski
*NL*
on
several
occasions
that
such
was
the
case
,
which
the
latter
gentleman
*NL*
considered
a
very
unpleasant
communication
indeed
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
of
late
,
Totski
had
observed
many
strange
and
original
features
*NL*
and
characteristics
in
Nastasia
,
which
he
had
neither
known
nor
reckoned
*NL*
upon
in
former
times
,
and
some
of
these
fascinated
him
,
even
now
,
in
*NL*
spite
of
the
fact
that
all
his
old
calculations
with
regard
to
her
were
*NL*
long
ago
cast
to
the
winds
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
maid
opened
the
door
for
the
prince
-LRB-
Nastasia
's
servants
were
all
*NL*
females
-RRB-
and
,
to
his
surprise
,
received
his
request
to
announce
him
to
*NL*
her
mistress
without
any
astonishment
.
Neither
his
dirty
boots
,
nor
his
*NL*
wide-brimmed
hat
,
nor
his
sleeveless
cloak
,
nor
his
evident
confusion
of
*NL*
manner
,
produced
the
least
impression
upon
her
.
She
helped
him
off
with
*NL*
his
cloak
,
and
begged
him
to
wait
a
moment
in
the
ante-room
while
she
*NL*
announced
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
company
assembled
at
Nastasia
Philipovna
's
consisted
of
none
but
her
*NL*
most
intimate
friends
,
and
formed
a
very
small
party
in
comparison
with
*NL*
her
usual
gatherings
on
this
anniversary
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
first
place
there
were
present
Totski
,
and
General
Epanchin
.
*NL*
They
were
both
highly
amiable
,
but
both
appeared
to
be
labouring
under
*NL*
a
half-hidden
feeling
of
anxiety
as
to
the
result
of
Nastasia
's
*NL*
deliberations
with
regard
to
Gania
,
which
result
was
to
be
made
public
*NL*
this
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
of
course
,
there
was
Gania
who
was
by
no
means
so
amiable
as
*NL*
his
elders
,
but
stood
apart
,
gloomy
,
and
miserable
,
and
silent
.
He
had
*NL*
determined
not
to
bring
Varia
with
him
;
but
Nastasia
had
not
even
asked
*NL*
after
her
,
though
no
sooner
had
he
arrived
than
she
had
reminded
him
of
*NL*
the
episode
between
himself
and
the
prince
.
The
general
,
who
had
heard
*NL*
nothing
of
it
before
,
began
to
listen
with
some
interest
,
while
Gania
,
*NL*
drily
,
but
with
perfect
candour
,
went
through
the
whole
history
,
*NL*
including
the
fact
of
his
apology
to
the
prince
.
He
finished
by
*NL*
declaring
that
the
prince
was
a
most
extraordinary
man
,
and
goodness
*NL*
knows
why
he
had
been
considered
an
idiot
hitherto
,
for
he
was
very
far
*NL*
from
being
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nastasia
listened
to
all
this
with
great
interest
;
but
the
conversation
*NL*
soon
turned
to
Rogojin
and
his
visit
,
and
this
theme
proved
of
the
*NL*
greatest
attraction
to
both
Totski
and
the
general
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ptitsin
was
able
to
afford
some
particulars
as
to
Rogojin
's
conduct
*NL*
since
the
afternoon
.
He
declared
that
he
had
been
busy
finding
money
for
*NL*
the
latter
ever
since
,
and
up
to
nine
o'clock
,
Rogojin
having
declared
*NL*
that
he
must
absolutely
have
a
hundred
thousand
roubles
by
the
evening
.
*NL*
He
added
that
Rogojin
was
drunk
,
of
course
;
but
that
he
thought
the
*NL*
money
would
be
forthcoming
,
for
the
excited
and
intoxicated
rapture
of
*NL*
the
fellow
impelled
him
to
give
any
interest
or
premium
that
was
asked
*NL*
of
him
,
and
there
were
several
others
engaged
in
beating
up
the
money
,
*NL*
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
news
was
received
by
the
company
with
somewhat
gloomy
interest
.
*NL*
Nastasia
was
silent
,
and
would
not
say
what
she
thought
about
it
.
Gania
*NL*
was
equally
uncommunicative
.
The
general
seemed
the
most
anxious
of
all
,
*NL*
and
decidedly
uneasy
.
The
present
of
pearls
which
he
had
prepared
with
*NL*
so
much
joy
in
the
morning
had
been
accepted
but
coldly
,
and
Nastasia
*NL*
had
smiled
rather
disagreeably
as
she
took
it
from
him
.
Ferdishenko
was
*NL*
the
only
person
present
in
good
spirits
.
*NL*
*NL*
Totski
himself
,
who
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
capital
talker
,
and
*NL*
was
usually
the
life
and
soul
of
these
entertainments
,
was
as
silent
*NL*
as
any
on
this
occasion
,
and
sat
in
a
state
of
,
for
him
,
most
uncommon
*NL*
perturbation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rest
of
the
guests
-LRB-
an
old
tutor
or
schoolmaster
,
goodness
knows
*NL*
why
invited
;
a
young
man
,
very
timid
,
and
shy
and
silent
;
a
rather
*NL*
loud
woman
of
about
forty
,
apparently
an
actress
;
and
a
very
pretty
,
*NL*
well-dressed
German
lady
who
hardly
said
a
word
all
the
evening
-RRB-
not
*NL*
only
had
no
gift
for
enlivening
the
proceedings
,
but
hardly
knew
what
to
*NL*
say
for
themselves
when
addressed
.
Under
these
circumstances
the
arrival
*NL*
of
the
prince
came
almost
as
a
godsend
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
announcement
of
his
name
gave
rise
to
some
surprise
and
to
some
*NL*
smiles
,
especially
when
it
became
evident
,
from
Nastasia
's
astonished
*NL*
look
,
that
she
had
not
thought
of
inviting
him
.
But
her
astonishment
*NL*
once
over
,
Nastasia
showed
such
satisfaction
that
all
prepared
to
greet
*NL*
the
prince
with
cordial
smiles
of
welcome
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
''
remarked
General
Epanchin
,
``
he
does
this
out
of
pure
*NL*
innocence
.
It
's
a
little
dangerous
,
perhaps
,
to
encourage
this
sort
of
*NL*
freedom
;
but
it
is
rather
a
good
thing
that
he
has
arrived
just
at
this
*NL*
moment
.
He
may
enliven
us
a
little
with
his
originalities
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Especially
as
he
asked
himself
,
''
said
Ferdishenko
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
that
got
to
do
with
it
?
''
asked
the
general
,
who
loathed
*NL*
Ferdishenko
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
he
must
pay
toll
for
his
entrance
,
''
explained
the
latter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
H
'm
!
Prince
Muishkin
is
not
Ferdishenko
,
''
said
the
general
,
*NL*
impatiently
.
This
worthy
gentleman
could
never
quite
reconcile
himself
*NL*
to
the
idea
of
meeting
Ferdishenko
in
society
,
and
on
an
equal
footing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
general
,
spare
Ferdishenko
!
''
replied
the
other
,
smiling
.
``
I
have
*NL*
special
privileges
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
by
special
privileges
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Once
before
I
had
the
honour
of
stating
them
to
the
company
.
I
will
*NL*
repeat
the
explanation
to-day
for
your
excellency
's
benefit
.
You
see
,
*NL*
excellency
,
all
the
world
is
witty
and
clever
except
myself
.
I
am
*NL*
neither
.
As
a
kind
of
compensation
I
am
allowed
to
tell
the
truth
,
for
*NL*
it
is
a
well-known
fact
that
only
stupid
people
tell
`
the
truth
.
'
Added
*NL*
to
this
,
I
am
a
spiteful
man
,
just
because
I
am
not
clever
.
If
I
am
*NL*
offended
or
injured
I
bear
it
quite
patiently
until
the
man
injuring
*NL*
me
meets
with
some
misfortune
.
Then
I
remember
,
and
take
my
revenge
.
I
*NL*
return
the
injury
sevenfold
,
as
Ivan
Petrovitch
Ptitsin
says
.
-LRB-
Of
course
*NL*
he
never
does
so
himself
.
-RRB-
Excellency
,
no
doubt
you
recollect
Kryloff
's
*NL*
fable
,
`
The
Lion
and
the
Ass
'
?
Well
now
,
that
's
you
and
I
.
That
fable
*NL*
was
written
precisely
for
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
seem
to
be
talking
nonsense
again
,
Ferdishenko
,
''
growled
the
*NL*
general
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
,
excellency
?
I
know
how
to
keep
my
place
.
When
I
*NL*
said
just
now
that
we
,
you
and
I
,
were
the
lion
and
the
ass
of
Kryloff
's
*NL*
fable
,
of
course
it
is
understood
that
I
take
the
role
of
the
ass
.
Your
*NL*
excellency
is
the
lion
of
which
the
fable
remarks
:
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
mighty
lion
,
terror
of
the
woods
,
*NL*
Was
shorn
of
his
great
prowess
by
old
age
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
And
I
,
your
excellency
,
am
the
ass
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
of
your
opinion
on
that
last
point
,
''
said
Ivan
Fedorovitch
,
with
*NL*
ill-concealed
irritation
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
was
no
doubt
extremely
coarse
,
and
moreover
it
was
*NL*
premeditated
,
but
after
all
Ferdishenko
had
persuaded
everyone
to
accept
*NL*
him
as
a
buffoon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
am
admitted
and
tolerated
here
,
''
he
had
said
one
day
,
``
it
is
*NL*
simply
because
I
talk
in
this
way
.
How
can
anyone
possibly
receive
*NL*
such
a
man
as
I
am
?
I
quite
understand
.
Now
,
could
I
,
a
Ferdishenko
,
*NL*
be
allowed
to
sit
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
a
clever
man
like
Afanasy
*NL*
Ivanovitch
?
There
is
one
explanation
,
only
one
.
I
am
given
the
position
*NL*
because
it
is
so
entirely
inconceivable
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
these
vulgarities
seemed
to
please
Nastasia
Philipovna
,
although
too
*NL*
often
they
were
both
rude
and
offensive
.
Those
who
wished
to
go
to
her
*NL*
house
were
forced
to
put
up
with
Ferdishenko
.
Possibly
the
latter
was
*NL*
not
mistaken
in
imagining
that
he
was
received
simply
in
order
to
annoy
*NL*
Totski
,
who
disliked
him
extremely
.
Gania
also
was
often
made
the
butt
*NL*
of
the
jester
's
sarcasms
,
who
used
this
method
of
keeping
in
Nastasia
*NL*
Philipovna
's
good
graces
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
prince
will
begin
by
singing
us
a
fashionable
ditty
,
''
remarked
*NL*
Ferdishenko
,
and
looked
at
the
mistress
of
the
house
,
to
see
what
she
*NL*
would
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
so
,
Ferdishenko
;
please
be
quiet
,
''
answered
Nastasia
*NL*
Philipovna
dryly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A-ah
!
if
he
is
to
be
under
special
patronage
,
I
withdraw
my
claws
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Nastasia
Philipovna
had
now
risen
and
advanced
to
meet
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
so
sorry
to
have
forgotten
to
ask
you
to
come
,
when
I
saw
you
,
''
*NL*
she
said
,
``
and
I
am
delighted
to
be
able
to
thank
you
personally
now
,
*NL*
and
to
express
my
pleasure
at
your
resolution
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
she
gazed
into
his
eyes
,
longing
to
see
whether
she
could
make
*NL*
any
guess
as
to
the
explanation
of
his
motive
in
coming
to
her
house
.
*NL*
The
prince
would
very
likely
have
made
some
reply
to
her
kind
words
,
but
*NL*
he
was
so
dazzled
by
her
appearance
that
he
could
not
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nastasia
noticed
this
with
satisfaction
.
She
was
in
full
dress
this
*NL*
evening
;
and
her
appearance
was
certainly
calculated
to
impress
all
*NL*
beholders
.
She
took
his
hand
and
led
him
towards
her
other
guests
.
But
*NL*
just
before
they
reached
the
drawing-room
door
,
the
prince
stopped
her
,
*NL*
and
hurriedly
and
in
great
agitation
whispered
to
her
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
altogether
perfection
;
even
your
pallor
and
thinness
are
*NL*
perfect
;
one
could
not
wish
you
otherwise
.
I
did
so
wish
to
come
and
see
*NL*
you
.
I
--
forgive
me
,
please
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
apologize
,
''
said
Nastasia
,
laughing
;
``
you
spoil
the
whole
*NL*
originality
of
the
thing
.
I
think
what
they
say
about
you
must
be
true
,
*NL*
that
you
are
so
original
.
--
So
you
think
me
perfection
,
do
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
H
'm
!
Well
,
you
may
be
a
good
reader
of
riddles
but
you
are
wrong
*NL*
_
there
_
,
at
all
events
.
I
'll
remind
you
of
this
,
tonight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nastasia
introduced
the
prince
to
her
guests
,
to
most
of
whom
he
was
*NL*
already
known
.
*NL*
*NL*
Totski
immediately
made
some
amiable
remark
.
All
seemed
to
brighten
up
at
*NL*
once
,
and
the
conversation
became
general
.
Nastasia
made
the
prince
sit
*NL*
down
next
to
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
me
,
there
's
nothing
so
very
curious
about
the
prince
dropping
in
,
*NL*
after
all
,
''
remarked
Ferdishenko
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
quite
a
clear
case
,
''
said
the
hitherto
silent
Gania
.
``
I
have
*NL*
watched
the
prince
almost
all
day
,
ever
since
the
moment
when
he
first
*NL*
saw
Nastasia
Philipovna
's
portrait
,
at
General
Epanchin
's
.
I
remember
*NL*
thinking
at
the
time
what
I
am
now
pretty
sure
of
;
and
what
,
I
may
say
*NL*
in
passing
,
the
prince
confessed
to
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gania
said
all
this
perfectly
seriously
,
and
without
the
slightest
*NL*
appearance
of
joking
;
indeed
,
he
seemed
strangely
gloomy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
confess
anything
to
you
,
''
said
the
prince
,
blushing
.
``
I
only
*NL*
answered
your
question
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bravo
!
That
's
frank
,
at
any
rate
!
''
shouted
Ferdishenko
,
and
there
was
*NL*
general
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
prince
,
prince
!
I
never
should
have
thought
it
of
you
;
''
said
General
*NL*
Epanchin
.
``
And
I
imagined
you
a
philosopher
!
Oh
,
you
silent
fellows
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Judging
from
the
fact
that
the
prince
blushed
at
this
innocent
joke
,
*NL*
like
a
young
girl
,
I
should
think
that
he
must
,
as
an
honourable
man
,
*NL*
harbour
the
noblest
intentions
,
''
said
the
old
toothless
schoolmaster
,
*NL*
most
unexpectedly
;
he
had
not
so
much
as
opened
his
mouth
before
.
*NL*
This
remark
provoked
general
mirth
,
and
the
old
fellow
himself
laughed
*NL*
loudest
of
the
lot
,
but
ended
with
a
stupendous
fit
of
coughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nastasia
Philipovna
,
who
loved
originality
and
drollery
of
all
kinds
,
*NL*
was
apparently
very
fond
of
this
old
man
,
and
rang
the
bell
for
more
tea
*NL*
to
stop
his
coughing
.
It
was
now
half-past
ten
o'clock
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
would
n't
you
like
a
little
champagne
now
?
''
she
asked
.
``
I
*NL*
have
it
all
ready

it
will
cheer
us
up
--
do
now
--
no
ceremony
!

*NL*
*NL*
This
invitation
to
drink
,
couched
,
as
it
was
,
in
such
informal
terms
,
*NL*
came
very
strangely
from
Nastasia
Philipovna
.
Her
usual
entertainments
*NL*
were
not
quite
like
this
;
there
was
more
style
about
them
.
However
,
the
*NL*
wine
was
not
refused
;
each
guest
took
a
glass
excepting
Gania
,
who
drank
*NL*
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
extremely
difficult
to
account
for
Nastasia
's
strange
condition
*NL*
of
mind
,
which
became
more
evident
each
moment
,
and
which
none
could
*NL*
avoid
noticing
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
her
glass
,
and
vowed
she
would
empty
it
three
times
that
*NL*
evening
.
She
was
hysterical
,
and
laughed
aloud
every
other
minute
*NL*
with
no
apparent
reason
--
the
next
moment
relapsing
into
gloom
and
*NL*
thoughtfulness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
of
her
guests
suspected
that
she
must
be
ill
;
but
concluded
at
last
*NL*
that
she
was
expecting
something
,
for
she
continued
to
look
at
her
watch
*NL*
impatiently
and
unceasingly
;
she
was
most
absent
and
strange
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
seem
to
be
a
little
feverish
tonight
,
''
said
the
actress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
feel
quite
ill
.
I
have
been
obliged
to
put
on
this
shawl
--
I
feel
*NL*
so
cold
,
''
replied
Nastasia
.
She
certainly
had
grown
very
pale
,
and
every
*NL*
now
and
then
she
tried
to
suppress
a
trembling
in
her
limbs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Had
we
not
better
allow
our
hostess
to
retire
?
''
asked
Totski
of
the
*NL*
general
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
,
gentlemen
,
not
at
all
!
Your
presence
is
absolutely
*NL*
necessary
to
me
tonight
,
''
said
Nastasia
,
significantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
most
of
those
present
were
aware
that
this
evening
a
certain
very
*NL*
important
decision
was
to
be
taken
,
these
words
of
Nastasia
Philipovna
's
*NL*
appeared
to
be
fraught
with
much
hidden
interest
.
The
general
and
Totski
*NL*
exchanged
looks
;
Gania
fidgeted
convulsively
in
his
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
play
at
some
game
!
''
suggested
the
actress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
a
new
and
most
delightful
game
,
added
Ferdishenko
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
asked
the
actress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
when
we
tried
it
we
were
a
party
of
people
,
like
this
,
for
*NL*
instance
;
and
somebody
proposed
that
each
of
us
,
without
leaving
his
*NL*
place
at
the
table
,
should
relate
something
about
himself
.
It
had
to
be
*NL*
something
that
he
really
and
honestly
considered
the
very
worst
action
*NL*
he
had
ever
committed
in
his
life
.
But
he
was
to
be
honest
--
that
was
the
*NL*
chief
point
!
He
was
n't
to
be
allowed
to
lie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
an
extraordinary
idea
!
''
said
the
general
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
beauty
of
it
,
general
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
funny
notion
,
''
said
Totski
,
``
and
yet
quite
natural
--
it
's
only
a
*NL*
new
way
of
boasting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
that
is
just
what
was
so
fascinating
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
it
would
be
a
game
to
cry
over
--
not
to
laugh
at
!
''
said
the
*NL*
actress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
it
succeed
?
''
asked
Nastasia
Philipovna
.
``
Come
,
let
's
try
it
,
let
's
*NL*
try
it
;
we
really
are
not
quite
so
jolly
as
we
might
be
--
let
's
try
it
!
*NL*
We
may
like
it
;
it
's
original
,
at
all
events
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Ferdishenko
;
``
it
's
a
good
idea
--
come
along
--
the
men
begin
.
*NL*
Of
course
no
one
need
tell
a
story
if
he
prefers
to
be
disobliging
.
We
*NL*
must
draw
lots
!
Throw
your
slips
of
paper
,
gentlemen
,
into
this
hat
,
and
*NL*
the
prince
shall
draw
for
turns
.
It
's
a
very
simple
game
;
all
you
have
*NL*
to
do
is
to
tell
the
story
of
the
worst
action
of
your
life
.
It
's
as
*NL*
simple
as
anything
.
I
'll
prompt
anyone
who
forgets
the
rules
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
liked
the
idea
much
.
Some
smiled
,
some
frowned
some
objected
,
*NL*
but
faintly
,
not
wishing
to
oppose
Nastasia
's
wishes
;
for
this
new
idea
*NL*
seemed
to
be
rather
well
received
by
her
.
She
was
still
in
an
excited
,
*NL*
hysterical
state
,
laughing
convulsively
at
nothing
and
everything
.
Her
*NL*
eyes
were
blazing
,
and
her
cheeks
showed
two
bright
red
spots
against
*NL*
the
white
.
The
melancholy
appearance
of
some
of
her
guests
seemed
to
add
*NL*
to
her
sarcastic
humour
,
and
perhaps
the
very
cynicism
and
cruelty
of
*NL*
the
game
proposed
by
Ferdishenko
pleased
her
.
At
all
events
she
was
*NL*
attracted
by
the
idea
,
and
gradually
her
guests
came
round
to
her
side
;
*NL*
the
thing
was
original
,
at
least
,
and
might
turn
out
to
be
amusing
.
``
And
*NL*
supposing
it
's
something
that
one
--
one
ca
n't
speak
about
before
ladies
?
''
*NL*
asked
the
timid
and
silent
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
then
of
course
,
you
wo
n't
say
anything
about
it
.
As
if
there
*NL*
are
not
plenty
of
sins
to
your
score
without
the
need
of
those
!
''
said
*NL*
Ferdishenko
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
really
do
n't
know
which
of
my
actions
is
the
worst
,
''
said
the
*NL*
lively
actress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ladies
are
exempted
if
they
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
are
you
to
know
that
one
is
n't
lying
?
And
if
one
lies
the
whole
*NL*
point
of
the
game
is
lost
,
''
said
Gania
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
think
how
delightful
to
hear
how
one
's
friends
lie
!
Besides
*NL*
you
need
n't
be
afraid
,
Gania
;
everybody
knows
what
your
worst
action
is
*NL*
without
the
need
of
any
lying
on
your
part
.
Only
think
,
gentlemen
,
''
--
and
*NL*
Ferdishenko
here
grew
quite
enthusiastic
,
``
only
think
with
what
eyes
we
*NL*
shall
observe
one
another
tomorrow
,
after
our
tales
have
been
told
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
surely
this
is
a
joke
,
Nastasia
Philipovna
?
''
asked
Totski
.
``
You
*NL*
do
n't
really
mean
us
to
play
this
game
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whoever
is
afraid
of
wolves
had
better
not
go
into
the
wood
,
''
said
*NL*
Nastasia
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
pardon
me
,
Mr.
Ferdishenko
,
is
it
possible
to
make
a
game
out
of
*NL*
this
kind
of
thing
?
''
persisted
Totski
,
growing
more
and
more
uneasy
.
``
I
*NL*
assure
you
it
ca
n't
be
a
success
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
not
?
Why
,
the
last
time
I
simply
told
straight
off
about
how
I
*NL*
stole
three
roubles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
so
;
but
it
is
hardly
possible
that
you
told
it
so
that
it
*NL*
seemed
like
truth
,
or
so
that
you
were
believed
.
And
,
as
Gavrila
*NL*
Ardalionovitch
has
said
,
the
least
suggestion
of
a
falsehood
takes
all
*NL*
point
out
of
the
game
.
It
seems
to
me
that
sincerity
,
on
the
other
hand
,
*NL*
is
only
possible
if
combined
with
a
kind
of
bad
taste
that
would
be
*NL*
utterly
out
of
place
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
subtle
you
are
,
Afanasy
Ivanovitch
!
You
astonish
me
,
''
cried
*NL*
Ferdishenko
.
``
You
will
remark
,
gentleman
,
that
in
saying
that
I
*NL*
could
not
recount
the
story
of
my
theft
so
as
to
be
believed
,
Afanasy
*NL*
Ivanovitch
has
very
ingeniously
implied
that
I
am
not
capable
of
*NL*
thieving
--
-LRB-
it
would
have
been
bad
taste
to
say
so
openly
-RRB-
;
and
all
the
*NL*
time
he
is
probably
firmly
convinced
,
in
his
own
mind
,
that
I
am
very
*NL*
well
capable
of
it
!
But
now
,
gentlemen
,
to
business
!
Put
in
your
slips
,
*NL*
ladies
and
gentlemen
--
is
yours
in
,
Mr.
Totski
?
So
--
then
we
are
all
*NL*
ready
;
now
prince
,
draw
,
please
.
''
The
prince
silently
put
his
hand
into
*NL*
the
hat
,
and
drew
the
names
.
Ferdishenko
was
first
,
then
Ptitsin
,
then
*NL*
the
general
,
Totski
next
,
his
own
fifth
,
then
Gania
,
and
so
on
;
the
*NL*
ladies
did
not
draw
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dear
!
oh
,
dear
!
''
cried
Ferdishenko
.
``
I
did
so
hope
the
prince
would
*NL*
come
out
first
,
and
then
the
general
.
Well
,
gentlemen
,
I
suppose
I
*NL*
must
set
a
good
example
!
What
vexes
me
much
is
that
I
am
such
an
*NL*
insignificant
creature
that
it
matters
nothing
to
anybody
whether
I
have
*NL*
done
bad
actions
or
not
!
Besides
,
which
am
I
to
choose
?
It
's
an
_
embarras
*NL*
de
richesse
_
.
Shall
I
tell
how
I
became
a
thief
on
one
occasion
only
,
to
*NL*
convince
Afanasy
Ivanovitch
that
it
is
possible
to
steal
without
being
a
*NL*
thief
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
go
on
,
Ferdishenko
,
and
do
n't
make
unnecessary
preface
,
or
you
'll
*NL*
never
finish
,
''
said
Nastasia
Philipovna
.
All
observed
how
irritable
and
*NL*
cross
she
had
become
since
her
last
burst
of
laughter
;
but
none
the
less
*NL*
obstinately
did
she
stick
to
her
absurd
whim
about
this
new
game
.
Totski
*NL*
sat
looking
miserable
enough
.
The
general
lingered
over
his
champagne
,
*NL*
and
seemed
to
be
thinking
of
some
story
for
the
time
when
his
turn
*NL*
should
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
XIV
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
wit
,
Nastasia
Philipovna
,
''
began
Ferdishenko
,
``
and
therefore
*NL*
I
talk
too
much

perhaps

Were
I
as
witty

now
,
as
Mr.
Totski
or
the
*NL*
general
,
I
should
probably
have
sat
silent
all
the
evening
,
as
they
*NL*
have
.
Now
,
prince
,
what
do
you
think
?
--
are
there
not
far
more
thieves
*NL*
than
honest
men
in
this
world

Do
n't
you
think
we
may
say
there
does
*NL*
not
exist
a
single
person
so
honest
that
he
has
never
stolen
anything
*NL*
whatever
in
his
life

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
silly

the
actress

``
Of

it
is
not

*NL*
``
H

very
well

Daria
Alexeyevna

agreed

But
how
about
the
prince
,
now
--
look
how
he
is
blushing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
are
partially
right

you
exaggerate

said
the
prince
,
*NL*
who
had
certainly
blushed
up
,
of
a
sudden
,
for
some
reason
or
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ferdishenko

either
tell
us
your

be
quiet

your

exhaust
all
patience

cuttingly
and
irritably
remarked
*NL*
Nastasia
Philipovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Immediately
,
immediately
!
As
for
my
story
,
gentlemen
,
it
is
too
stupid
*NL*
and
absurd
to
tell
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
assure
you
I
am
not
a
thief
,
and
yet
I
have
stolen
;
I
can
not
explain
*NL*
why
.
It
was
at
Semeon
Ivanovitch
Ishenka
's
country
house
,
one
Sunday
.
He
*NL*
had
a
dinner
party
.
After
dinner
the
men
stayed
at
the
table
over
their
*NL*
wine
.
It
struck
me
to
ask
the
daughter
of
the
house
to
play
something
*NL*
on
the
piano
;
so
I
passed
through
the
corner
room
to
join
the
ladies
.
In
*NL*
that
room
,
on
Maria
Ivanovna
's
writing-table
,
I
observed
a
three-rouble
*NL*
note
.
She
must
have
taken
it
out
for
some
purpose
,
and
left
it
lying
*NL*
there
.
There
was
no
one
about
.
I
took
up
the
note
and
put
it
in
my
*NL*
pocket
;
why
,
I
ca
n't
say
.
I
do
n't
know
what
possessed
me
to
do
it
,
but
*NL*
it
was
done
,
and
I
went
quickly
back
to
the
dining-room
and
reseated
*NL*
myself
at
the
dinner-table
.
I
sat
and
waited
there
in
a
great
state
of
*NL*
excitement
.
I
talked
hard
,
and
told
lots
of
stories
,
and
laughed
like
*NL*
mad
;
then
I
joined
the
ladies
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
half
an
hour
or
so
the
loss
was
discovered
,
and
the
servants
were
*NL*
being
put
under
examination
.
Daria
,
the
housemaid
was
suspected
.
I
*NL*
exhibited
the
greatest
interest
and
sympathy
,
and
I
remember
that
*NL*
poor
Daria
quite
lost
her
head
,
and
that
I
began
assuring
her
,
before
*NL*
everyone
,
that
I
would
guarantee
her
forgiveness
on
the
part
of
her
*NL*
mistress
,
if
she
would
confess
her
guilt
.
They
all
stared
at
the
girl
,
*NL*
and
I
remember
a
wonderful
attraction
in
the
reflection
that
here
was
I
*NL*
sermonizing
away
,
with
the
money
in
my
own
pocket
all
the
while
.
I
went
*NL*
and
spent
the
three
roubles
that
very
evening
at
a
restaurant
.
I
went
in
*NL*
and
asked
for
a
bottle
of
Lafite
,
and
drank
it
up
;
I
wanted
to
be
rid
of
*NL*
the
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
feel
much
remorse
either
then
or
afterwards
;
but
I
would
not
*NL*
repeat
the
performance
--
believe
it
or
not
as
you
please
.
There
--
that
's
*NL*
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
,
of
course
that
's
not
nearly
your
worst
action

said
the
actress
,
*NL*
with
evident
dislike
in
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
a
psychological
phenomenon
,
not
an
action

remarked
Totski
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
about
the
maid
?
''
asked
Nastasia
Philipovna
,
with
undisguised
*NL*
contempt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
she
was
turned
out
next
day
,
of
course
.
It
's
a
very
strict
*NL*
household
,
there
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
allowed
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
so
,
rather
!
I
was
not
going
to
return
and
confess
*NL*
next
day
,
''
laughed
Ferdishenko
,
who
seemed
a
little
surprised
at
the
*NL*
disagreeable
impression
which
his
story
had
made
on
all
parties
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
mean
you
were
!
''
said
Nastasia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bah
!
you
wish
to
hear
a
man
tell
of
his
worst
actions
,
and
you
expect
*NL*
the
story
to
come
out
goody-goody
!
One
's
worst
actions
always
are
mean
.
*NL*
We
shall
see
what
the
general
has
to
say
for
himself
now
.
All
is
not
*NL*
gold
that
glitters
,
you
know
;
and
because
a
man
keeps
his
carriage
he
*NL*
need
not
be
specially
virtuous
,
I
assure
you
,
all
sorts
of
people
keep
*NL*
carriages
.
And
by
what
means
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
word
,
Ferdishenko
was
very
angry
and
rapidly
forgetting
himself
;
*NL*
his
whole
face
was
drawn
with
passion
.
Strange
as
it
may
appear
,
he
had
*NL*
expected
much
better
success
for
his
story
.
These
little
errors
of
taste
*NL*
on
Ferdishenko
's
part
occurred
very
frequently
.
Nastasia
trembled
with
*NL*
rage
,
and
looked
fixedly
at
him
,
whereupon
he
relapsed
into
alarmed
*NL*
silence
.
He
realized
that
he
had
gone
a
little
too
far
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Had
we
not
better
end
this
game
?
''
asked
Totski
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
my
turn
,
but
I
plead
exemption
,
''
said
Ptitsin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
care
to
oblige
us
?
''
asked
Nastasia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
,
I
assure
you
.
I
confess
I
do
not
understand
how
anyone
can
*NL*
play
this
game
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
general
,
it
's
your
turn
,
''
continued
Nastasia
Philipovna
,
``
and
if
*NL*
you
refuse
,
the
whole
game
will
fall
through
,
which
will
disappoint
me
*NL*
very
much
,
for
I
was
looking
forward
to
relating
a
certain
`
page
of
my
*NL*
own
life
.
'
I
am
only
waiting
for
you
and
Afanasy
Ivanovitch
to
have
your
*NL*
turns
,
for
I
require
the
support
of
your
example
,
''
she
added
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
if
you
put
it
in
that
way
,
''
cried
the
general
,
excitedly
,
``
I
'm
*NL*
ready
to
tell
the
whole
story
of
my
life
,
but
I
must
confess
that
I
*NL*
prepared
a
little
story
in
anticipation
of
my
turn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nastasia
smiled
amiably
at
him
;
but
evidently
her
depression
and
*NL*
irritability
were
increasing
with
every
moment
.
Totski
was
dreadfully
*NL*
alarmed
to
hear
her
promise
a
revelation
out
of
her
own
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
,
like
everyone
else
,
''
began
the
general
,
``
have
committed
certain
not
*NL*
altogether
graceful
actions
,
so
to
speak
,
during
the
course
of
my
life
.
*NL*
But
the
strangest
thing
of
all
in
my
case
is
,
that
I
should
consider
the
*NL*
little
anecdote
which
I
am
now
about
to
give
you
as
a
confession
of
*NL*
the
worst
of
my
`
bad
actions
.
'
It
is
thirty-five
years
since
it
all
*NL*
happened
,
and
yet
I
can
not
to
this
very
day
recall
the
circumstances
*NL*
without
,
as
it
were
,
a
sudden
pang
at
the
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a
silly
affair
--
I
was
an
ensign
at
the
time
.
You
know
*NL*
ensigns
--
their
blood
is
boiling
water
,
their
circumstances
generally
*NL*
penurious
.
Well
,
I
had
a
servant
Nikifor
who
used
to
do
everything
for
*NL*
me
in
my
quarters
,
economized
and
managed
for
me
,
and
even
laid
hands
on
*NL*
anything
he
could
find
-LRB-
belonging
to
other
people
-RRB-
,
in
order
to
augment
*NL*
our
household
goods
;
but
a
faithful
,
honest
fellow
all
the
same
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
strict
,
but
just
by
nature
.
At
that
time
we
were
stationed
in
*NL*
a
small
town
.
I
was
quartered
at
an
old
widow
's
house
,
a
lieutenant
's
*NL*
widow
of
eighty
years
of
age
.
She
lived
in
a
wretched
little
wooden
*NL*
house
,
and
had
not
even
a
servant
,
so
poor
was
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
relations
had
all
died
off
--
her
husband
was
dead
and
buried
forty
*NL*
years
since
;
and
a
niece
,
who
had
lived
with
her
and
bullied
her
up
to
*NL*
three
years
ago
,
was
dead
too
;
so
that
she
was
quite
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
was
precious
dull
with
her
,
especially
as
she
was
so
childish
*NL*
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
got
out
of
her
.
Eventually
,
she
stole
a
*NL*
fowl
of
mine
;
the
business
is
a
mystery
to
this
day
;
but
it
could
have
*NL*
been
no
one
but
herself
.
I
requested
to
be
quartered
somewhere
else
,
*NL*
and
was
shifted
to
the
other
end
of
the
town
,
to
the
house
of
a
merchant
*NL*
with
a
large
family
,
and
a
long
beard
,
as
I
remember
him
.
Nikifor
and
I
*NL*
were
delighted
to
go
;
but
the
old
lady
was
not
pleased
at
our
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
a
day
or
two
afterwards
,
when
I
returned
from
drill
,
Nikifor
*NL*
says
to
me
:
`
We
ought
n't
to
have
left
our
tureen
with
the
old
lady
,
I
've
*NL*
nothing
to
serve
the
soup
in
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
asked
how
it
came
about
that
the
tureen
had
been
left
.
Nikifor
*NL*
explained
that
the
old
lady
refused
to
give
it
up
,
because
,
she
said
,
*NL*
we
had
broken
her
bowl
,
and
she
must
have
our
tureen
in
place
of
it
;
she
*NL*
had
declared
that
I
had
so
arranged
the
matter
with
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
baseness
on
her
part
of
course
aroused
my
young
blood
to
fever
*NL*
heat
;
I
jumped
up
,
and
away
I
flew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
arrived
at
the
old
woman
's
house
beside
myself
.
She
was
sitting
in
*NL*
a
corner
all
alone
,
leaning
her
face
on
her
hand
.
I
fell
on
her
like
a
*NL*
clap
of
thunder
.
`
You
old
wretch
!
'
I
yelled
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
,
*NL*
in
real
Russian
style
.
Well
,
when
I
began
cursing
at
her
,
a
strange
*NL*
thing
happened
.
I
looked
at
her
,
and
she
stared
back
with
her
eyes
*NL*
starting
out
of
her
head
,
but
she
did
not
say
a
word
.
She
seemed
to
*NL*
sway
about
as
she
sat
,
and
looked
and
looked
at
me
in
the
strangest
*NL*
way
.
Well
,
I
soon
stopped
swearing
and
looked
closer
at
her
,
asked
her
*NL*
questions
,
but
not
a
word
could
I
get
out
of
her
.
The
flies
were
buzzing
*NL*
about
the
room
and
only
this
sound
broke
the
silence
;
the
sun
was
*NL*
setting
outside
;
I
did
n't
know
what
to
make
of
it
,
so
I
went
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Before
I
reached
home
I
was
met
and
summoned
to
the
major
's
,
so
that
it
*NL*
was
some
while
before
I
actually
got
there
.
When
I
came
in
,
Nikifor
met
*NL*
me
.
`
Have
you
heard
,
sir
,
that
our
old
lady
is
dead
?
'
'
_
dead
_
,
when
?
'
`
Oh
,
*NL*
an
hour
and
a
half
ago
.
'
That
meant
nothing
more
nor
less
than
that
she
*NL*
was
dying
at
the
moment
when
I
pounced
on
her
and
began
abusing
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
produced
a
great
effect
upon
me
.
I
used
to
dream
of
the
poor
old
*NL*
woman
at
nights
.
I
really
am
not
superstitious
,
but
two
days
after
,
I
*NL*
went
to
her
funeral
,
and
as
time
went
on
I
thought
more
and
more
about
*NL*
her
.
I
said
to
myself
,
`
This
woman
,
this
human
being
,
lived
to
a
great
*NL*
age
.
She
had
children
,
a
husband
and
family
,
friends
and
relations
;
her
*NL*
household
was
busy
and
cheerful
;
she
was
surrounded
by
smiling
faces
;
*NL*
and
then
suddenly
they
are
gone
,
and
she
is
left
alone
like
a
solitary
*NL*
fly
...
like
a
fly
,
cursed
with
the
burden
of
her
age
.
At
last
,
God
calls
*NL*
her
to
Himself
.
At
sunset
,
on
a
lovely
summer
's
evening
,
my
little
old
*NL*
woman
passes
away
--
a
thought
,
you
will
notice
,
which
offers
much
food
*NL*
for
reflection
--
and
behold
!
instead
of
tears
and
prayers
to
start
her
*NL*
on
her
last
journey
,
she
has
insults
and
jeers
from
a
young
ensign
,
who
*NL*
stands
before
her
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
making
a
terrible
row
*NL*
about
a
soup
tureen
!
'
Of
course
I
was
to
blame
,
and
even
now
that
I
have
*NL*
time
to
look
back
at
it
calmly
,
I
pity
the
poor
old
thing
no
less
.
*NL*
I
repeat
that
I
wonder
at
myself
,
for
after
all
I
was
not
really
*NL*
responsible
.
Why
did
she
take
it
into
her
head
to
die
at
that
moment
?
*NL*
But
the
more
I
thought
of
it
,
the
more
I
felt
the
weight
of
it
upon
my
*NL*
mind
;
and
I
never
got
quite
rid
of
the
impression
until
I
put
a
couple
*NL*
of
old
women
into
an
almshouse
and
kept
them
there
at
my
own
expense
.
*NL*
There
,
that
's
all
.
I
repeat
I
dare
say
I
have
committed
many
a
grievous
*NL*
sin
in
my
day
;
but
I
can
not
help
always
looking
back
upon
this
as
the
*NL*
worst
action
I
have
ever
perpetrated
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
H
'm
!
and
instead
of
a
bad
action
,
your
excellency
has
detailed
one
of
*NL*
your
noblest
deeds
,
''
said
Ferdishenko
.
``
Ferdishenko
is
`
done

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
me

general

said
Nastasia
Philipovna
,
absently
,
``
I
really
never
*NL*
imagined
you
had
such
a
good
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
general
laughed
with
great
satisfaction
,
and
applied
himself
once
*NL*
more
to
the
champagne
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
now
Totski
's
turn
,
and
his
story
was
awaited
with
great
*NL*
curiosity
--
while
all
eyes
turned
on
Nastasia
Philipovna
,
as
though
*NL*
anticipating
that
his
revelation
must
be
connected
somehow
with
her
.
*NL*
Nastasia
,
during
the
whole
of
his
story
,
pulled
at
the
lace
trimming
of
*NL*
her
sleeve
,
and
never
once
glanced
at
the
speaker
.
Totski
was
a
handsome
*NL*
man
,
rather
stout
,
with
a
very
polite
and
dignified
manner
.
He
was
*NL*
always
well
dressed
,
and
his
linen
was
exquisite
.
He
had
plump
white
*NL*
hands
,
and
wore
a
magnificent
diamond
ring
on
one
finger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
simplifies
the
duty
before
me
considerably
,
in
my
opinion
,
''
he
*NL*
began
,
``
is
that
I
am
bound
to
recall
and
relate
the
very
worst
action
of
*NL*
my
life
.
In
such
circumstances
there
can
,
of
course
,
be
no
doubt
.
One
's
*NL*
conscience
very
soon
informs
one
what
is
the
proper
narrative
to
tell
.
I
*NL*
admit
,
that
among
the
many
silly
and
thoughtless
actions
of
my
life
,
the
*NL*
memory
of
one
comes
prominently
forward
and
reminds
me
that
it
lay
long
*NL*
like
a
stone
on
my
heart
.
Some
twenty
years
since
,
I
paid
a
visit
to
*NL*
Platon
Ordintzeff
at
his
country-house
.
He
had
just
been
elected
marshal
*NL*
of
the
nobility
,
and
had
come
there
with
his
young
wife
for
the
winter
*NL*
holidays
.
Anfisa
Alexeyevna
's
birthday
came
off
just
then
,
too
,
and
*NL*
there
were
two
balls
arranged
.
At
that
time
Dumas-fils
'
beautiful
work
,
*NL*
_
La
Dame
aux
Camelias
_
--
a
novel
which
I
consider
imperishable
--
had
just
*NL*
come
into
fashion
.
In
the
provinces
all
the
ladies
were
in
raptures
over
*NL*
it
,
those
who
had
read
it
,
at
least
.
Camellias
were
all
the
fashion
.
*NL*
Everyone
inquired
for
them
,
everybody
wanted
them
;
and
a
grand
lot
of
*NL*
camellias
are
to
be
got
in
a
country
town
--
as
you
all
know
--
and
two
*NL*
balls
to
provide
for
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
Peter
Volhofskoi
was
desperately
in
love
with
Anfisa
Alexeyevna
.
*NL*
I
do
n't
know
whether
there
was
anything
--
I
mean
I
do
n't
know
whether
*NL*
he
could
possibly
have
indulged
in
any
hope
.
The
poor
fellow
was
beside
*NL*
himself
to
get
her
a
bouquet
of
camellias
.
Countess
Sotski
and
Sophia
*NL*
Bespalova
,
as
everyone
knew
,
were
coming
with
white
camellia
bouquets
.
*NL*
Anfisa
wished
for
red
ones
,
for
effect
.
Well
,
her
husband
Platon
was
*NL*
driven
desperate
to
find
some
.
And
the
day
before
the
ball
,
Anfisa
's
*NL*
rival
snapped
up
the
only
red
camellias
to
be
had
in
the
place
,
from
*NL*
under
Platon
's
nose
,
and
Platon
--
wretched
man
--
was
done
for
.
Now
if
*NL*
Peter
had
only
been
able
to
step
in
at
this
moment
with
a
red
bouquet
,
*NL*
his
little
hopes
might
have
made
gigantic
strides
.
A
woman
's
gratitude
*NL*
under
such
circumstances
would
have
been
boundless
--
but
it
was
*NL*
practically
an
impossibility
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
night
before
the
ball
I
met
Peter
,
looking
radiant
.
`
What
is
it
?
'
*NL*
I
ask
.
`
I
've
found
them
,
Eureka
!
'
`
No
!
where
,
where
?
'
`
At
Ekshaisk
-LRB-
a
*NL*
little
town
fifteen
miles
off
-RRB-
there
's
a
rich
old
merchant
,
who
keeps
*NL*
a
lot
of
canaries
,
has
no
children
,
and
he
and
his
wife
are
devoted
to
*NL*
flowers
.
He
's
got
some
camellias
.
'
`
And
what
if
he
wo
n't
let
you
have
*NL*
them
?
'
`
I
'll
go
on
my
knees
and
implore
till
I
get
them
.
I
wo
n't
go
*NL*
away
.
'
`
When
shall
you
start
?
'
`
Tomorrow
morning
at
five
o'clock
.
'
`
Go
*NL*
on
,
'
I
said
,
`
and
good
luck
to
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
glad
for
the
poor
fellow
,
and
went
home
.
But
an
idea
got
hold
of
*NL*
me
somehow
.
I
do
n't
know
how
.
It
was
nearly
two
in
the
morning
.
I
rang
*NL*
the
bell
and
ordered
the
coachman
to
be
waked
up
and
sent
to
me
.
He
*NL*
came
.
I
gave
him
a
tip
of
fifteen
roubles
,
and
told
him
to
get
the
*NL*
carriage
ready
at
once
.
In
half
an
hour
it
was
at
the
door
.
I
got
in
and
*NL*
off
we
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
five
I
drew
up
at
the
Ekshaisky
inn
.
I
waited
there
till
dawn
,
and
*NL*
soon
after
six
I
was
off
,
and
at
the
old
merchant
Trepalaf
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Camellias
!
'
I
said
,
`
father
,
save
me
,
save
me
,
let
me
have
some
*NL*
camellias
!
'
He
was
a
tall
,
grey
old
man
--
a
terrible-looking
old
*NL*
gentleman
.
`
Not
a
bit
of
it
,
'
he
says
.
'
I
wo
n't
.
'
Down
I
went
on
my
*NL*
knees
.
`
Do
n't
say
so
,
do
n't
--
think
what
you
're
doing
!
'
I
cried
;
`
it
's
a
*NL*
matter
of
life
and
death
!
'
`
If
that
's
the
case
,
take
them
,
'
says
he
.
*NL*
So
up
I
get
,
and
cut
such
a
bouquet
of
red
camellias
!
He
had
a
whole
*NL*
greenhouse
full
of
them
--
lovely
ones
.
The
old
fellow
sighs
.
I
pull
out
a
*NL*
hundred
roubles
.
`
No
,
no
!
'
says
he
,
`
do
n't
insult
me
that
way
.
'
`
Oh
,
if
*NL*
that
's
the
case
,
give
it
to
the
village
hospital
,
'
I
say
.
`
Ah
,
'
he
says
,
*NL*
`
that
's
quite
a
different
matter
;
that
's
good
of
you
and
generous
.
I
'll
*NL*
pay
it
in
there
for
you
with
pleasure
.
'
I
liked
that
old
fellow
,
Russian
*NL*
to
the
core
,
_
de
la
vraie
souche
_
.
I
went
home
in
raptures
,
but
took
*NL*
another
road
in
order
to
avoid
Peter
.
Immediately
on
arriving
I
sent
up
*NL*
the
bouquet
for
Anfisa
to
see
when
she
awoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
imagine
her
ecstasy
,
her
gratitude
.
The
wretched
Platon
,
who
*NL*
had
almost
died
since
yesterday
of
the
reproaches
showered
upon
him
,
*NL*
wept
on
my
shoulder
.
Of
course
poor
Peter
had
no
chance
after
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
he
would
cut
my
throat
at
first
,
and
went
about
armed
ready
*NL*
to
meet
him
.
But
he
took
it
differently
;
he
fainted
,
and
had
brain
fever
*NL*
and
convulsions
.
A
month
after
,
when
he
had
hardly
recovered
,
he
went
*NL*
off
to
the
Crimea
,
and
there
he
was
shot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
assure
you
this
business
left
me
no
peace
for
many
a
long
year
.
Why
*NL*
did
I
do
it
?
I
was
not
in
love
with
her
myself
;
I
'm
afraid
it
was
simply
*NL*
mischief
--
pure
`
cussedness
'
on
my
part
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
had
n't
seized
that
bouquet
from
under
his
nose
he
might
have
been
*NL*
alive
now
,
and
a
happy
man
.
He
might
have
been
successful
in
life
,
and
*NL*
never
have
gone
to
fight
the
Turks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Totski
ended
his
tale
with
the
same
dignity
that
had
characterized
its
*NL*
commencement
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nastasia
Philipovna
's
eyes
were
flashing
in
a
most
unmistakable
way
,
*NL*
now
;
and
her
lips
were
all
a-quiver
by
the
time
Totski
finished
his
*NL*
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
present
watched
both
of
them
with
curiosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
right
,
Totski
,
''
said
Nastasia
,
``
it
is
a
dull
game
and
a
stupid
*NL*
one
.
I
'll
just
tell
my
story
,
as
I
promised
,
and
then
we
'll
play
cards
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
let
's
have
the
story
first
!
''
cried
the
general
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Prince

''
said
Nastasia
Philipovna
,
unexpectedly
turning
to
Muishkin
,
*NL*
``
here
are
my
old
friends
,
Totski
and
General
Epanchin
,
who
wish
to
marry

me
off

Tell
me
what
you
think

Shall
I
marry
or
not
?
As
you
decide
,
so
*NL*
shall
it
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Totski
grew
white
as
a
sheet
.
The
general
was
struck
dumb
.
All
present
*NL*
started
and
listened
intently
.
Gania
sat
rooted
to
his
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marry
whom
?
''
asked
the
prince
,
faintly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gavrila
Ardalionovitch
Ivolgin
,
''
said
Nastasia
,
firmly
and
evenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
a
few
seconds
of
dead
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
tried
to
speak
,
but
could
not
form
his
words
;
a
great
weight
*NL*
seemed
to
lie
upon
his
breast
and
suffocate
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
N-no
!
do
n't
marry
him
!
''
he
whispered
at
last
,
drawing
his
breath
with
*NL*
an
effort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
be
it
,
then
.
Gavrila
Ardalionovitch
,
''
she
spoke
solemnly
and
*NL*
forcibly
,
``
you
hear
the
prince
's
decision
?
Take
it
as
my
decision
;
and
*NL*
let
that
be
the
end
of
the
matter
for
good
and
all

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nastasia

cried
Totski
,
in
a
quaking
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nastasia
Philipovna

''
said
the
general
,
in
persuasive
but
agitated
*NL*
tones
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everyone
in
the
room
fidgeted
in
their
places
,
and
waited
to
see
what
*NL*
was
coming
next
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
gentlemen
!
''
she
continued
,
gazing
around
in
apparent
*NL*
astonishment
;
``
what
do
you
all
look
so
alarmed
about
?
Why
are
you
so
*NL*
upset
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
--
recollect
,
Nastasia
Philipovna

''
stammered
Totski
,
``
you
gave
a
*NL*
promise

quite
a
free
one

and
you
might
have
spared
us
this

I
am
*NL*
confused
and
bewildered
,
I
know
;
but
,
in
a
word
,
at
such
a
moment
,
and
*NL*
before
company
,
and
all
so-so-irregular
,
finishing
off
a
game
with
a
*NL*
serious
matter
like
this
,
a
matter
of
honour
,
and
of
heart
,
and
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
follow
you

you
are
losing
your

In
*NL*
the
first
place
,
what
do
you
mean
by

before
company

Is
n't
the
company
*NL*
good
enough
for
you

And
what
's
all
that
about

a
game

I
wished
to

my
little
story

I
told
it

I
refused

my
whole

hanging
on

cried
the
general

who
could
conceal
his
wrath
no
*NL*
longer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The

this

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
only
remains
for
me
,
then

to
thank
Nastasia
Philipovna
for
the
*NL*
great
delicacy
with
which
she
has
treated
me

said
Gania
,
as
pale
as
*NL*
death
,
and
with
quivering
lips
.
``
That
is
my
plain
duty
,
of
course
;
but
*NL*
the
prince

what
has
he
to
do
in
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
what
you
are
driving
at
,
''
said
Nastasia
Philipovna
.
``
You
imply
*NL*
that
the
prince
is
after
the
seventy-five
thousand
roubles

I
quite
*NL*
understand
you

Mr.
Totski
,
I
forgot
to
say
,
`
Take
your
seventy-five
*NL*
thousand
roubles

--
I
do
n't
want
them

I
let
you
go
free
for
nothing

take
*NL*
your
freedom
!
You
must
need
it

Nine
years
and
three
months
'
captivity
*NL*
is
enough
for
anybody

Tomorrow
I
shall
start
afresh

today

am
a
free

agent
for
the
first
time

must
take

back

too

give
them

Tomorrow
I
shall
leave
this
flat
altogether
,
and
*NL*
then
there
'll
be
no
more
of
these
pleasant
little
social
gatherings
,
*NL*
ladies
and
gentlemen

''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
she
scornfully
rose
from
her
seat
as
though
to
depart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nastasia
Philipovna
!
Nastasia
Philipovna
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
words
burst
involuntarily
from
every
mouth
.
All
present
started
up
*NL*
in
bewildered
excitement
;
all
surrounded
her
;
all
had
listened
uneasily
*NL*
to
her
wild
,
disconnected
sentences
.
All
felt
that
something
had
*NL*
happened
,
something
had
gone
very
far
wrong
indeed
,
but
no
one
could
*NL*
make
head
or
tail
of
the
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
there
was
a
furious
ring
at
the
bell
,
and
a
great
knock
*NL*
at
the
door
--
exactly
similar
to
the
one
which
had
startled
the
company
*NL*
at
Gania
's
house
in
the
afternoon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
ah
!
here
's
the
climax
at
last
,
at
half-past
twelve
!

cried
Nastasia
*NL*
Philipovna
.
``
Sit
down
,
gentlemen
,
I
beg
you
.
Something
is
about
to
*NL*
happen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
she
reseated
herself
;
a
strange
smile
played
on
her
lips
.
She
*NL*
sat
quite
still
,
but
watched
the
door
in
a
fever
of
impatience
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rogojin
and
his
hundred
thousand
roubles
,
no
doubt
of
it

''
muttered
*NL*
Ptitsin
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
XV
.
*NL*
*NL*
Katia
,
the
maid-servant
,
made
her
appearance
,
terribly
frightened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Goodness
knows
what
it
means
,
ma'am
,
''
she
said
.
``
There
is
a
whole
*NL*
collection
of
men
come
--
all
tipsy
--
and
want
to
see
you

They
say
that
*NL*
`
it
's
Rogojin
,
and
she
knows
all
about
it
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
right

Katia
,
let
them
all
in
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
not
_
all
_
,
ma'am
?
They
seem
so
disorderly
--
it
's
dreadful
to

them

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
_
all

,
Katia
,
all

every
one
of
them

Let
them
in

or
they
'll
come
*NL*
in
whether
you
like
or
no
.
Listen
!
what
a
noise
they
are
making
!
Perhaps
*NL*
you
are
offended
,
gentlemen
,
that
I
should
receive
such
guests
in
your
*NL*
presence
?
I
am
very
sorry
,
and
ask
your
forgiveness
,
but
it
can
not
be
*NL*
helped
--
and
I
should
be
very
grateful
if
you
could
all
stay
and
witness
*NL*
this
climax
.
However
,
just
as
you
please
,
of
course
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
guests
exchanged
glances
;
they
were
annoyed
and
bewildered
by
the
*NL*
episode
;
but
it
was
clear
enough
that
all
this
had
been
pre-arranged
and
*NL*
expected
by
Nastasia
Philipovna
,
and
that
there
was
no
use
in
trying
to
*NL*
stop
her
now
--
for
she
was
little
short
of
insane
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
,
they
were
naturally
inquisitive
to
see
what
was
to
happen
.
*NL*
There
was
nobody
who
would
be
likely
to
feel
much
alarm
.
There
were
*NL*
but
two
ladies
present
;
one
of
whom
was
the
lively
actress
,
who
was
not
*NL*
easily
frightened
,
and
the
other
the
silent
German
beauty
who
,
it
turned
*NL*
out
,
did
not
understand
a
word
of
Russian
,
and
seemed
to
be
as
stupid
as
*NL*
she
was
lovely
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
acquaintances
invited
her
to
their
``
At
Homes
''
because
she
was
so
*NL*
decorative
.
She
was
exhibited
to
their
guests
like
a
valuable
picture
,
*NL*
or
vase
,
or
statue
,
or
firescreen
.
As
for
the
men
,
Ptitsin
was
one
of
*NL*
Rogojin
's
friends
;
Ferdishenko
was
as
much
at
home
as
a
fish
in
the
sea
,
*NL*
Gania
,
not
yet
recovered
from
his
amazement
,
appeared
to
be
chained
to
*NL*
a
pillory
.
The
old
professor
did
not
in
the
least
understand
what
was
*NL*
happening
;
but
when
he
noticed
how
extremely
agitated
the
mistress
of
*NL*
the
house
,
and
her
friends
,
seemed
,
he
nearly
wept
,
and
trembled
with
*NL*
fright
:
but
he
would
rather
have
died
than
leave
Nastasia
Philipovna
at
*NL*
such
a
crisis
,
for
he
loved
her
as
if
she
were
his
own
granddaughter
.
*NL*
Afanasy
Ivanovitch
greatly
disliked
having
anything
to
do
with
the
*NL*
affair
,
but
he
was
too
much
interested
to
leave
,
in
spite
of
the
mad
*NL*
turn
things
had
taken
;
and
a
few
words
that
had
dropped
from
the
lips
*NL*
of
Nastasia
puzzled
him
so
much
,
that
he
felt
he
could
not
go
without
*NL*
an
explanation
.
He
resolved
therefore
,
to
see
it
out
,
and
to
adopt
the
*NL*
attitude
of
silent
spectator
,
as
most
suited
to
his
dignity
.
General
*NL*
Epanchin
alone
determined
to
depart
.
He
was
annoyed
at
the
manner
in
*NL*
which
his
gift
had
been
returned
,
as
though
he
had
condescended
,
under
*NL*
the
influence
of
passion
,
to
place
himself
on
a
level
with
Ptitsin
and
*NL*
Ferdishenko
,
his
self-respect
and
sense
of
duty
now
returned
together
*NL*
with
a
consciousness
of
what
was
due
to
his
social
rank
and
official
*NL*
importance
.
In
short
,
he
plainly
showed
his
conviction
that
a
man
in
his
*NL*
position
could
have
nothing
to
do
with
Rogojin
and
his
companions
.
But
*NL*
Nastasia
interrupted
him
at
his
first
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
general
!
''
she
cried
,
``
I
was
forgetting
!
If
I
had
only
foreseen
*NL*
this
unpleasantness
!
I
wo
n't
insist
on
keeping
you
against
your
will
,
*NL*
although
I
should
have
liked
you
to
be
beside
me
now
.
In
any
case
,
I
am
*NL*
most
grateful
to
you
for
your
visit
,
and
flattering
attention
...
but
if
*NL*
you
are
afraid
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
Nastasia
Philipovna
,
''
interrupted
the
general
,
with
*NL*
chivalric
generosity
.
``
To
whom
are
you
speaking
?
I
have
remained
until
*NL*
now
simply
because
of
my
devotion
to
you
,
and
as
for
danger
,
I
am
only
*NL*
afraid
that
the
carpets
may
be
ruined
,
and
the
furniture
smashed
!
...
You
*NL*
should
shut
the
door
on
the
lot
,
in
my
opinion
.
But
I
confess
that
I
am
*NL*
extremely
curious
to
see
how
it
ends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rogojin
!
''
announced
Ferdishenko
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
think
about
it
?
''
said
the
general
in
a
low
voice
to
Totski
.
*NL*
``
Is
she
mad
?
I
mean
mad
in
the
medical
sense
of
the
word
...
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
always
said
she
was
predisposed
to
it
,
''
whispered
Afanasy
*NL*
Ivanovitch
slyly
.
``
Perhaps
it
is
a
fever
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Since
their
visit
to
Gania
's
home
,
Rogojin
's
followers
had
been
*NL*
increased
by
two
new
recruits
--
a
dissolute
old
man
,
the
hero
of
some
*NL*
ancient
scandal
,
and
a
retired
sub-lieutenant
.
A
laughable
story
was
*NL*
told
of
the
former
.
He
possessed
,
it
was
said
,
a
set
of
false
teeth
,
and
*NL*
one
day
when
he
wanted
money
for
a
drinking
orgy
,
he
pawned
them
,
and
*NL*
was
never
able
to
reclaim
them
!
The
officer
appeared
to
be
a
rival
of
*NL*
the
gentleman
who
was
so
proud
of
his
fists
.
He
was
known
to
none
of
*NL*
Rogojin
's
followers
,
but
as
they
passed
by
the
Nevsky
,
where
he
stood
*NL*
begging
,
he
had
joined
their
ranks
.
His
claim
for
the
charity
he
desired
*NL*
seemed
based
on
the
fact
that
in
the
days
of
his
prosperity
he
had
given
*NL*
away
as
much
as
fifteen
roubles
at
a
time
.
The
rivals
seemed
more
than
*NL*
a
little
jealous
of
one
another
.
The
athlete
appeared
injured
at
the
*NL*
admission
of
the
``
beggar
''
into
the
company
.
By
nature
taciturn
,
he
now
*NL*
merely
growled
occasionally
like
a
bear
,
and
glared
contemptuously
*NL*
upon
the
``
beggar
,
''
who
,
being
somewhat
of
a
man
of
the
world
,
and
a
*NL*
diplomatist
,
tried
to
insinuate
himself
into
the
bear
's
good
graces
.
*NL*
He
was
a
much
smaller
man
than
the
athlete
,
and
doubtless
was
conscious
*NL*
that
he
must
tread
warily
.
Gently
and
without
argument
he
alluded
to
*NL*
the
advantages
of
the
English
style
in
boxing
,
and
showed
himself
a
*NL*
firm
believer
in
Western
institutions
.
The
athlete
's
lips
curled
*NL*
disdainfully
,
and
without
honouring
his
adversary
with
a
formal
denial
,
*NL*
he
exhibited
,
as
if
by
accident
,
that
peculiarly
Russian
object
--
an
*NL*
enormous
fist
,
clenched
,
muscular
,
and
covered
with
red
hairs
!
The
sight
*NL*
of
this
pre-eminently
national
attribute
was
enough
to
convince
anybody
,
*NL*
without
words
,
that
it
was
a
serious
matter
for
those
who
should
happen
*NL*
to
come
into
contact
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
None
of
the
band
were
very
drunk
,
for
the
leader
had
kept
his
intended
*NL*
visit
to
Nastasia
in
view
all
day
,
and
had
done
his
best
to
prevent
*NL*
his
followers
from
drinking
too
much
.
He
was
sober
himself
,
but
the
*NL*
excitement
of
this
chaotic
day
--
the
strangest
day
of
his
life
--
had
*NL*
affected
him
so
that
he
was
in
a
dazed
,
wild
condition
,
which
almost
*NL*
resembled
drunkenness
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
kept
but
one
idea
before
him
all
day
,
and
for
that
he
had
worked
*NL*
in
an
agony
of
anxiety
and
a
fever
of
suspense
.
His
lieutenants
had
*NL*
worked
so
hard
from
five
o'clock
until
eleven
,
that
they
actually
had
*NL*
collected
a
hundred
thousand
roubles
for
him
,
but
at
such
terrific
*NL*
expense
,
that
the
rate
of
interest
was
only
mentioned
among
them
in
*NL*
whispers
and
with
bated
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
before
,
Rogojin
walked
in
advance
of
his
troop
,
who
followed
him
with
*NL*
mingled
self-assertion
and
timidity
.
They
were
specially
frightened
of
*NL*
Nastasia
Philipovna
herself
,
for
some
reason
.
*NL*
*NL*
Many
of
them
expected
to
be
thrown
downstairs
at
once
,
without
further
*NL*
ceremony
,
the
elegant
and
irresistible
Zaleshoff
among
them
.
But
*NL*
the
party
led
by
the
athlete
,
without
openly
showing
their
hostile
*NL*
intentions
,
silently
nursed
contempt
and
even
hatred
for
Nastasia
*NL*
Philipovna
,
and
marched
into
her
house
as
they
would
have
marched
into
*NL*
an
enemy
's
fortress
.
Arrived
there
,
the
luxury
of
the
rooms
seemed
to
*NL*
inspire
them
with
a
kind
of
respect
,
not
unmixed
with
alarm
.
So
many
*NL*
things
were
entirely
new
to
their
experience
--
the
choice
furniture
,
the
*NL*
pictures
,
the
great
statue
of
Venus
.
They
followed
their
chief
into
the
*NL*
salon
,
however
,
with
a
kind
of
impudent
curiosity
.
There
,
the
sight
of
*NL*
General
Epanchin
among
the
guests
,
caused
many
of
them
to
beat
a
hasty
*NL*
retreat
into
the
adjoining
room
,
the
``
boxer
''
and
``
beggar
''
being
among
*NL*
the
first
to
go
.
A
few
only
,
of
whom
Lebedeff
made
one
,
stood
their
*NL*
ground
;
he
had
contrived
to
walk
side
by
side
with
Rogojin
,
for
he
quite
*NL*
understood
the
importance
of
a
man
who
had
a
fortune
of
a
million
odd
*NL*
roubles
,
and
who
at
this
moment
carried
a
hundred
thousand
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
It
may
be
added
that
the
whole
company
,
not
excepting
Lebedeff
,
had
the
*NL*
vaguest
idea
of
the
extent
of
their
powers
,
and
of
how
far
they
could
*NL*
safely
go
.
At
some
moments
Lebedeff
was
sure
that
right
was
on
their
*NL*
side
;
at
others
he
tried
uneasily
to
remember
various
cheering
and
*NL*
reassuring
articles
of
the
Civil
Code
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rogojin
,
when
he
stepped
into
the
room
,
and
his
eyes
fell
upon
Nastasia
,
*NL*
stopped
short
,
grew
white
as
a
sheet
,
and
stood
staring
;
it
was
clear
*NL*
that
his
heart
was
beating
painfully
.
So
he
stood
,
gazing
intently
,
but
*NL*
timidly
,
for
a
few
seconds
.
Suddenly
,
as
though
bereft
of
his
senses
,
he
*NL*
moved
forward
,
staggering
helplessly
,
towards
the
table
.
On
his
way
he
*NL*
collided
against
Ptitsin
's
chair
,
and
put
his
dirty
foot
on
the
lace
*NL*
skirt
of
the
silent
lady
's
dress
;
but
he
neither
apologized
for
this
,
*NL*
nor
even
noticed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
reaching
the
table
,
he
placed
upon
it
a
strange-looking
object
,
which
*NL*
he
had
carried
with
him
into
the
drawing-room
.
This
was
a
paper
packet
,
*NL*
some
six
or
seven
inches
thick
,
and
eight
or
nine
in
length
,
wrapped
in
*NL*
an
old
newspaper
,
and
tied
round
three
or
four
times
with
string
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
placed
this
before
her
,
he
stood
with
drooped
arms
and
head
,
as
*NL*
though
awaiting
his
sentence
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
costume
was
the
same
as
it
had
been
in
the
morning
,
except
for
a
new
*NL*
silk
handkerchief
round
his
neck
,
bright
green
and
red
,
fastened
with
a
*NL*
huge
diamond
pin
,
and
an
enormous
diamond
ring
on
his
dirty
forefinger
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lebedeff
stood
two
or
three
paces
behind
his
chief
;
and
the
rest
of
the
*NL*
band
waited
about
near
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
maid-servants
were
both
peeping
in
,
frightened
and
amazed
at
*NL*
this
unusual
and
disorderly
scene
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
that
?
''
asked
Nastasia
Philipovna
,
gazing
intently
at
Rogojin
,
*NL*
and
indicating
the
paper
packet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
hundred
thousand
,
''
replied
the
latter
,
almost
in
a
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
so
he
kept
his
word
--
there
's
a
man
for
you
!
Well
,
sit
down
,
*NL*
please
--
take
that
chair
.
I
shall
have
something
to
say
to
you
presently
.
*NL*
Who
are
all
these
with
you
?
The
same
party
?
Let
them
come
in
and
sit
*NL*
down
.
There
's
room
on
that
sofa
,
there
are
some
chairs
and
there
's
*NL*
another
sofa
!
Well
,
why
do
n't
they
sit
down
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sure
enough
,
some
of
the
brave
fellows
entirely
lost
their
heads
at
this
*NL*
point
,
and
retreated
into
the
next
room
.
Others
,
however
,
took
the
hint
*NL*
and
sat
down
,
as
far
as
they
could
from
the
table
,
however
;
feeling
*NL*
braver
in
proportion
to
their
distance
from
Nastasia
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rogojin
took
the
chair
offered
him
,
but
he
did
not
sit
long
;
he
soon
*NL*
stood
up
again
,
and
did
not
reseat
himself
.
Little
by
little
he
began
*NL*
to
look
around
him
and
discern
the
other
guests
.
Seeing
Gania
,
he
smiled
*NL*
venomously
and
muttered
to
himself
,
``
Look
at
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
gazed
at
Totski
and
the
general
with
no
apparent
confusion
,
and
with
*NL*
very
little
curiosity
.
But
when
he
observed
that
the
prince
was
seated
*NL*
beside
Nastasia
Philipovna
,
he
could
not
take
his
eyes
off
him
for
*NL*
a
long
while
,
and
was
clearly
amazed
.
He
could
not
account
for
the
*NL*
prince
's
presence
there
.
It
was
not
in
the
least
surprising
that
Rogojin
*NL*
should
be
,
at
this
time
,
in
a
more
or
less
delirious
condition
;
for
not
*NL*
to
speak
of
the
excitements
of
the
day
,
he
had
spent
the
night
before
in
*NL*
the
train
,
and
had
not
slept
more
than
a
wink
for
forty-eight
hours
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
,
gentlemen
,
is
a
hundred
thousand
roubles
,
''
said
Nastasia
*NL*
Philipovna
,
addressing
the
company
in
general
,
``
here
,
in
this
dirty
*NL*
parcel
.
This
afternoon
Rogojin
yelled
,
like
a
madman
,
that
he
would
*NL*
bring
me
a
hundred
thousand
in
the
evening
,
and
I
have
been
waiting
for
*NL*
him
all
the
while
.
He
was
bargaining
for
me
,
you
know
;
first
he
offered
*NL*
me
eighteen
thousand
;
then
he
rose
to
forty
,
and
then
to
a
hundred
*NL*
thousand
.
And
he
has
kept
his
word
,
see
!
My
goodness
,
how
white
he
is
!
*NL*
All
this
happened
this
afternoon
,
at
Gania
's
.
I
had
gone
to
pay
his
*NL*
mother
a
visit
--
my
future
family
,
you
know
!
And
his
sister
said
to
my
*NL*
very
face
,
surely
somebody
will
turn
this
shameless
creature
out
.
After
*NL*
which
she
spat
in
her
brother
Gania
's
face
--
a
girl
of
character
,
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nastasia
Philipovna
!
''
began
the
general
,
reproachfully
.
He
was
*NL*
beginning
to
put
his
own
interpretation
on
the
affair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
,
general
?
Not
quite
good
form
,
eh
?
Oh
,
nonsense
!
Here
have
*NL*
I
been
sitting
in
my
box
at
the
French
theatre
for
the
last
five
years
*NL*
like
a
statue
of
inaccessible
virtue
,
and
kept
out
of
the
way
of
all
*NL*
admirers
,
like
a
silly
little
idiot
!
Now
,
there
's
this
man
,
who
comes
*NL*
and
pays
down
his
hundred
thousand
on
the
table
,
before
you
all
,
in
*NL*
spite
of
my
five
years
of
innocence
and
proud
virtue
,
and
I
dare
be
*NL*
sworn
he
has
his
sledge
outside
waiting
to
carry
me
off
.
He
values
me
*NL*
at
a
hundred
thousand
!
I
see
you
are
still
angry
with
me
,
Gania
!
*NL*
Why
,
surely
you
never
really
wished
to
take
_
me
_
into
your
family
?
_
me
_
,
*NL*
Rogojin
's
mistress
!
What
did
the
prince
say
just
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
said
you
were
Rogojin
's
mistress
--
you
are
_
not
!
_
''
said
the
*NL*
prince
,
in
trembling
accents
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nastasia
Philipovna
,
dear
soul
!
''
cried
the
actress
,
impatiently
,
``
do
*NL*
be
calm
,
dear
!
If
it
annoys
you
so
--
all
this
--
do
go
away
and
rest
!
Of
*NL*
course
you
would
never
go
with
this
wretched
fellow
,
in
spite
of
his
*NL*
hundred
thousand
roubles
!
Take
his
money
and
kick
him
out
of
the
house
;
*NL*
that
's
the
way
to
treat
him
and
the
likes
of
him
!
Upon
my
word
,
if
it
*NL*
were
my
business
,
I
'd
soon
clear
them
all
out
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
actress
was
a
kind-hearted
woman
,
and
highly
impressionable
.
She
was
*NL*
very
angry
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
cross
,
Daria
Alexeyevna
!
''
laughed
Nastasia
.
``
I
was
not
angry
*NL*
when
I
spoke
;
I
was
n't
reproaching
Gania
.
I
do
n't
know
how
it
was
that
I
*NL*
ever
could
have
indulged
the
whim
of
entering
an
honest
family
like
his
.
*NL*
I
saw
his
mother
--
and
kissed
her
hand
,
too
.
I
came
and
stirred
up
all
*NL*
that
fuss
,
Gania
,
this
afternoon
,
on
purpose
to
see
how
much
you
could
*NL*
swallow
--
you
surprised
me
,
my
friend
--
you
did
,
indeed
.
Surely
you
could
*NL*
not
marry
a
woman
who
accepts
pearls
like
those
you
knew
the
general
was
*NL*
going
to
give
me
,
on
the
very
eve
of
her
marriage
?
And
Rogojin
!
Why
,
in
*NL*
your
own
house
and
before
your
own
brother
and
sister
,
he
bargained
with
*NL*
me
!
Yet
you
could
come
here
and
expect
to
be
betrothed
to
me
before
you
*NL*
left
the
house
!
You
almost
brought
your
sister
,
too
.
Surely
what
Rogojin
*NL*
said
about
you
is
not
really
true
:
that
you
would
crawl
all
the
way
to
*NL*
the
other
end
of
the
town
,
on
hands
and
knees
,
for
three
roubles
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
he
would
!
''
said
Rogojin
,
quietly
,
but
with
an
air
of
absolute
*NL*
conviction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
H
'm
!
and
he
receives
a
good
salary
,
I
'm
told
.
Well
,
what
should
you
get
*NL*
but
disgrace
and
misery
if
you
took
a
wife
you
hated
into
your
family
*NL*
-LRB-
for
I
know
very
well
that
you
do
hate
me
-RRB-
?
No
,
no
!
I
believe
now
that
a
*NL*
man
like
you
would
murder
anyone
for
money
--
sharpen
a
razor
and
come
*NL*
up
behind
his
best
friend
and
cut
his
throat
like
a
sheep
--
I
've
read
*NL*
of
such
people
.
Everyone
seems
money-mad
nowadays
.
No
,
no
!
I
may
be
*NL*
shameless
,
but
you
are
far
worse
.
I
do
n't
say
a
word
about
that
other

Nastasia

delicate
of

Oh

what
a
tongue
!
What
dreadful
things
you
are
*NL*
saying

cried
the
general
,
wringing
his
hands
in
real
grief
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I

I

only
listening

Totski

with
dignity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
why
have
I
worried
him
,
for
five
years

and
never
let
him
go

free

Is
he
worth
it
?
He
is
only
just
what
he
ought
to
be
--
nothing
*NL*
particular
.
He
thinks
I
am
to
blame
,
too

He
gave
me
my
education
,
kept
*NL*
me
like
a
countess

Money
--
my
word
!
What
a
lot
of
money
he
spent
over
*NL*
me
!
And
he
tried
to
find
me
an
honest
husband
first
,
and
then
this
*NL*
Gania
,
here
.
And
what
do
you
think
?
All
these
five
years
I
did
not
*NL*
live
with
him
,
and
yet
I
took
his
money
,
and
considered
I
was
quite
*NL*
justified

You

abominable

as
you

I
might
have
married
long
ago

*NL*
not
Gania

Oh

no

that
would
have
been
abominable

*NL*
``
Would

I
had
some
thoughts

four

I
meant
mischief
,
I
confess

but
I
could
have
had
him
,
I
give
*NL*
you
my
word
;
he
asked
me
himself

But
I
thought
,
no

it
's
not
worthwhile
*NL*
to
take
such
advantage
of
him

No

I
had
better
go
on
to
the
streets

*NL*
accept
Rogojin

become
a
washerwoman

something

nothing

go
away

leave
everything
behind

shall
have
it
all
back

who
would
take
me

anything

Ask
Gania

there

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

*NL*
said
that
worthy
.
``
But

been
observing

for

*NL*
*NL*
Nastasia
Philipovna
looked
keenly
round
at
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
true

she
asked

*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite

the

cried
the

``
However

*NL*
*NL*
The

continued
to
regard
Nastasia
with
a
sorrowful
,

intent
and
*NL*
piercing
,
gaze
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
's
another
alternative
for
me

said
Nastasia
,
turning
once
more
to
*NL*
the
actress
;
``

he
does
it
out
of
pure
kindness

true

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
take
you

out

changed
*NL*
now

the
world
sees
things
as
they
really
are

That
's
all
*NL*
nonsense

Besides
,
how
can
you
marry
?
You
need
a
nurse

not
a
wife

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
rose
and
began
to
speak
in
a
trembling
,
timid
tone
,
but
with
*NL*
the
air
of
a
man
absolutely
sure
of
the
truth
of
his
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
nothing
,
Nastasia
Philipovna

I
have
seen
nothing
.
You
are
right
*NL*
so
far
;
but
I
consider
that
you
would
be
honouring
me
,
and
not
I
you
.
I
*NL*
am
a
nobody
.
You
have
suffered
,
you
have
passed
through
hell
and
emerged
*NL*
pure
,
and
that
is
very
much
.
Why
do
you
shame
yourself
by
desiring
to
*NL*
go
with
Rogojin
?
You
are
delirious
.
You
have
returned
to
Mr.
Totski
his
*NL*
seventy-five
thousand
roubles
,
and
declared
that
you
will
leave
this
*NL*
house
and
all
that
is
in
it
,
which
is
a
line
of
conduct
that
not
one
*NL*
person
here
would
imitate

Nastasia
Philipovna
,
I
love
you

I
would
die
*NL*
for
you

I
shall
never
let
any
man
say
one
word
against
you

Nastasia
*NL*
Philipovna
!
and
if
we
are
poor
,
I
can
work
for
both
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
prince
spoke
these
last
words
a
titter
was
heard
from
*NL*
Ferdishenko
;
Lebedeff
laughed
too
.
The
general
grunted
with
irritation
;
*NL*
Ptitsin
and
Totski
barely
restrained
their
smiles
.
The
rest
all
sat
*NL*
listening
,
open-mouthed
with
wonder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
perhaps
we
shall
not
be
poor
;
we
may
be
very
rich

Nastasia
*NL*
Philipovna

''
continued
the
prince
,
in
the
same
timid
,
quivering
tones
.
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
for
certain
,
and
I
'm
sorry
to
say
I
have
n't
had
an
*NL*
opportunity
of
finding
out
all
day
;
but
I
received
a
letter
from
Moscow
,
*NL*
while
I
was
in
Switzerland
,
from
a
Mr.
Salaskin
,
and
he
acquaints
me
*NL*
with
the
fact
that
I
am
entitled
to
a
very
large
inheritance
.
This
*NL*
letter
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
pulled
a
letter
out
of
his
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
raving
?
''
said
the
general
.
``
Are
we
really
in
a
mad-house
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
silence
for
a
moment
.
Then
Ptitsin
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
said
,
prince
,
that
your
letter
was
from
Salaskin
?
Salaskin
*NL*
is
a
very
eminent
man
,
indeed
,
in
his
own
world
;
he
is
a
wonderfully
*NL*
clever
solicitor
,
and
if
he
really
tells
you
this
,
I
think
you
may
be
*NL*
pretty
sure
that
he
is
right
.
It
so
happens
,
luckily
,
that
I
know
his
*NL*
handwriting
,
for
I
have
lately
had
business
with
him
.
If
you
would
allow
*NL*
me
to
see
it
,
I
should
perhaps
be
able
to
tell
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
held
out
the
letter
silently
,
but
with
a
shaking
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
what
?
''
said
the
general
,
much
agitated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
all
this
?
Is
he
really
heir
to
anything
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
present
concentrated
their
attention
upon
Ptitsin
,
reading
the
*NL*
prince
's
letter
.
The
general
curiosity
had
received
a
new
fillip
.
*NL*
Ferdishenko
could
not
sit
still
.
Rogojin
fixed
his
eyes
first
on
the
*NL*
prince
,
and
then
on
Ptitsin
,
and
then
back
again
;
he
was
extremely
*NL*
agitated
.
Lebedeff
could
not
stand
it
.
He
crept
up
and
read
over
*NL*
Ptitsin
's
shoulder
,
with
the
air
of
a
naughty
boy
who
expects
a
box
on
*NL*
the
ear
every
moment
for
his
indiscretion
.
*NL*
*NL*
XVI
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
good
business
,
''
said
Ptitsin
,
at
last
,
folding
the
letter
and
*NL*
handing
it
back
to
the
prince
.
``
You
will
receive
,
without
the
slightest
*NL*
trouble
,
by
the
last
will
and
testament
of
your
aunt
,
a
very
large
sum
*NL*
of
money
indeed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Impossible
!
''
cried
the
general
,
starting
up
as
if
he
had
been
shot
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ptitsin
explained
,
for
the
benefit
of
the
company
,
that
the
prince
's
*NL*
aunt
had
died
five
months
since
.
He
had
never
known
her
,
but
she
was
his
*NL*
mother
's
own
sister
,
the
daughter
of
a
Moscow
merchant
,
one
Paparchin
,
*NL*
who
had
died
a
bankrupt
.
But
the
elder
brother
of
this
same
Paparchin
,
*NL*
had
been
an
eminent
and
very
rich
merchant
.
A
year
since
it
had
so
*NL*
happened
that
his
only
two
sons
had
both
died
within
the
same
month
.
*NL*
This
sad
event
had
so
affected
the
old
man
that
he
,
too
,
had
died
very
*NL*
shortly
after
.
He
was
a
widower
,
and
had
no
relations
left
,
excepting
*NL*
the
prince
's
aunt
,
a
poor
woman
living
on
charity
,
who
was
herself
at
*NL*
the
point
of
death
from
dropsy
;
but
who
had
time
,
before
she
died
,
*NL*
to
set
Salaskin
to
work
to
find
her
nephew
,
and
to
make
her
will
*NL*
bequeathing
her
newly-acquired
fortune
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
appeared
that
neither
the
prince
,
nor
the
doctor
with
whom
he
lived
*NL*
in
Switzerland
,
had
thought
of
waiting
for
further
communications
;
*NL*
but
the
prince
had
started
straight
away
with
Salaskin
's
letter
in
his
*NL*
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
thing
I
may
tell
you
,
for
certain
,
''
concluded
Ptitsin
,
addressing
*NL*
the
prince
,
``
that
there
is
no
question
about
the
authenticity
of
this
*NL*
matter
.
Anything
that
Salaskin
writes
you
as
regards
your
unquestionable
*NL*
right
to
this
inheritance
,
you
may
look
upon
as
so
much
money
in
your
*NL*
pocket
.
I
congratulate
you
,
prince
;
you
may
receive
a
million
and
a
half
*NL*
of
roubles
,
perhaps
more
;
I
do
n't
know
.
All
I
_
do
_
know
is
that
Paparchin
*NL*
was
a
very
rich
merchant
indeed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hurrah
!
''
cried
Lebedeff
,
in
a
drunken
voice
.
``
Hurrah
for
the
last
of
*NL*
the
Muishkins
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
goodness
me
!
and
I
gave
him
twenty-five
roubles
this
morning
as
*NL*
though
he
were
a
beggar
,
''
blurted
out
the
general
,
half
senseless
with
*NL*
amazement
.
``
Well
,
I
congratulate
you
,
I
congratulate
you
!
''
And
the
*NL*
general
rose
from
his
seat
and
solemnly
embraced
the
prince
.
All
came
*NL*
forward
with
congratulations
;
even
those
of
Rogojin
's
party
who
had
*NL*
retreated
into
the
next
room
,
now
crept
softly
back
to
look
on
.
For
the
*NL*
moment
even
Nastasia
Philipovna
was
forgotten
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
gradually
the
consciousness
crept
back
into
the
minds
of
each
one
*NL*
present
that
the
prince
had
just
made
her
an
offer
of
marriage
.
The
*NL*
situation
had
,
therefore
,
become
three
times
as
fantastic
as
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Totski
sat
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
,
bewildered
.
He
was
the
only
guest
*NL*
left
sitting
at
this
time
;
the
others
had
thronged
round
the
table
in
*NL*
disorder
,
and
were
all
talking
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
generally
agreed
,
afterwards
,
in
recalling
that
evening
,
that
*NL*
from
this
moment
Nastasia
Philipovna
seemed
entirely
to
lose
her
senses
.
*NL*
She
continued
to
sit
still
in
her
place
,
looking
around
at
her
guests
*NL*
with
a
strange
,
bewildered
expression
,
as
though
she
were
trying
to
*NL*
collect
her
thoughts
,
and
could
not
.
Then
she
suddenly
turned
to
the
*NL*
prince
,
and
glared
at
him
with
frowning
brows
;
but
this
only
lasted
one
*NL*
moment
.
Perhaps
it
suddenly
struck
her
that
all
this
was
a
jest
,
but
his
*NL*
face
seemed
to
reassure
her
.
She
reflected
,
and
smiled
again
,
vaguely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
am
really
a
princess
,
''
she
whispered
to
herself
,
ironically
,
*NL*
and
glancing
accidentally
at
Daria
Alexeyevna
's
face
,
she
burst
out
*NL*
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
''
she
cried
,
``
this
is
an
unexpected
climax
,
after
all
.
I
*NL*
did
n't
expect
this
.
What
are
you
all
standing
up
for
,
gentlemen
?
Sit
*NL*
down
;
congratulate
me
and
the
prince
!
Ferdishenko
,
just
step
out
and
*NL*
order
some
more
champagne
,
will
you
?
Katia
,
Pasha
,
''
she
added
suddenly
,
*NL*
seeing
the
servants
at
the
door
,
``
come
here
!
I
'm
going
to
be
married
,
*NL*
did
you
hear
?
To
the
prince
.
He
has
a
million
and
a
half
of
roubles
;
he
*NL*
is
Prince
Muishkin
,
and
has
asked
me
to
marry
him
.
Here
,
prince
,
come
*NL*
and
sit
by
me
;
and
here
comes
the
wine
.
Now
then
,
ladies
and
gentlemen
,
*NL*
where
are
your
congratulations
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hurrah
!
''
cried
a
number
of
voices
.
A
rush
was
made
for
the
wine
by
*NL*
Rogojin
's
followers
,
though
,
even
among
them
,
there
seemed
some
sort
of
*NL*
realization
that
the
situation
had
changed
.
Rogojin
stood
and
looked
on
,
*NL*
with
an
incredulous
smile
,
screwing
up
one
side
of
his
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Prince
,
my
dear
fellow
,
do
remember
what
you
are
about
,
''
said
the
*NL*
general
,
approaching
Muishkin
,
and
pulling
him
by
the
coat
sleeve
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nastasia
Philipovna
overheard
the
remark
,
and
burst
out
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
general
!
''
she
cried
.
``
You
had
better
look
out
!
I
am
the
*NL*
princess
now
,
you
know
.
The
prince
wo
n't
let
you
insult
me
.
Afanasy
*NL*
Ivanovitch
,
why
do
n't
you
congratulate
me
?
I
shall
be
able
to
sit
at
*NL*
table
with
your
new
wife
,
now
.
Aha
!
you
see
what
I
gain
by
marrying
*NL*
a
prince
!
A
million
and
a
half
,
and
a
prince
,
and
an
idiot
into
the
*NL*
bargain
,
they
say
.
What
better
could
I
wish
for
?
Life
is
only
just
about
*NL*
to
commence
for
me
in
earnest
.
Rogojin
,
you
are
a
little
too
late
.
Away
*NL*
with
your
paper
parcel
!
I
'm
going
to
marry
the
prince
;
I
'm
richer
than
*NL*
you
are
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Rogojin
understood
how
things
were
tending
,
at
last
.
An
*NL*
inexpressibly
painful
expression
came
over
his
face
.
He
wrung
his
hands
;
*NL*
a
groan
made
its
way
up
from
the
depths
of
his
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surrender
her
,
for
God
's
sake
!
''
he
said
to
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
around
burst
out
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
Surrender
her
to
_
you
?
_
''
cried
Daria
Alexeyevna
.
``
To
a
fellow
who
*NL*
comes
and
bargains
for
a
wife
like
a
moujik
!
The
prince
wishes
to
marry
*NL*
her
,
and
you
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
do
I
,
so
do
I
!
This
moment
,
if
I
could
!
I
'd
give
every
farthing
I
*NL*
have
to
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
drunken
moujik
,
''
said
Daria
Alexeyevna
,
once
more
.
``
You
ought
to
be
*NL*
kicked
out
of
the
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
laughter
became
louder
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
hear
,
prince
?
''
said
Nastasia
Philipovna
.
``
Do
you
hear
how
this
*NL*
moujik
of
a
fellow
goes
on
bargaining
for
your
bride
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
drunk
,
''
said
the
prince
,
quietly
,
``
and
he
loves
you
very
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo
n't
you
be
ashamed
,
afterwards
,
to
reflect
that
your
wife
very
nearly
*NL*
ran
away
with
Rogojin
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
were
raving
,
you
were
in
a
fever
;
you
are
still
half
*NL*
delirious
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
wo
n't
you
be
ashamed
when
they
tell
you
,
afterwards
,
that
your
wife
*NL*
lived
at
Totski
's
expense
so
many
years
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
shall
not
be
ashamed
of
that
.
You
did
not
so
live
by
your
own
*NL*
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
'll
never
reproach
me
with
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
care
,
do
n't
commit
yourself
for
a
whole
lifetime
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nastasia
Philipovna
.
''
said
the
prince
,
quietly
,
and
with
deep
emotion
,
*NL*
``
I
said
before
that
I
shall
esteem
your
consent
to
be
my
wife
as
a
great
*NL*
honour
to
myself
,
and
shall
consider
that
it
is
you
who
will
honour
*NL*
me
,
not
I
you
,
by
our
marriage
.
You
laughed
at
these
words
,
and
others
*NL*
around
us
laughed
as
well
;
I
heard
them
.
Very
likely
I
expressed
myself
*NL*
funnily
,
and
I
may
have
looked
funny
,
but
,
for
all
that
,
I
believe
I
*NL*
understand
where
honour
lies
,
and
what
I
said
was
but
the
literal
truth
.
*NL*
You
were
about
to
ruin
yourself
just
now
,
irrevocably
;
you
would
*NL*
never
have
forgiven
yourself
for
so
doing
afterwards
;
and
yet
,
you
*NL*
are
absolutely
blameless
.
It
is
impossible
that
your
life
should
be
*NL*
altogether
ruined
at
your
age
.
What
matter
that
Rogojin
came
bargaining
*NL*
here
,
and
that
Gavrila
Ardalionovitch
would
have
deceived
you
if
he
*NL*
could
?
Why
do
you
continually
remind
us
of
these
facts
?
I
assure
you
*NL*
once
more
that
very
few
could
find
it
in
them
to
act
as
you
have
acted
*NL*
this
day
.
As
for
your
wish
to
go
with
Rogojin
,
that
was
simply
the
idea
*NL*
of
a
delirious
and
suffering
brain
.
You
are
still
quite
feverish
;
you
*NL*
ought
to
be
in
bed
,
not
here
.
You
know
quite
well
that
if
you
had
gone
*NL*
with
Rogojin
,
you
would
have
become
a
washer-woman
next
day
,
rather
than
*NL*
stay
with
him
.
You
are
proud
,
Nastasia
Philipovna
,
and
perhaps
you
have
*NL*
really
suffered
so
much
that
you
imagine
yourself
to
be
a
desperately
*NL*
guilty
woman
.
You
require
a
great
deal
of
petting
and
looking
after
,
*NL*
Nastasia
Philipovna
,
and
I
will
do
this
.
I
saw
your
portrait
this
*NL*
morning
,
and
it
seemed
quite
a
familiar
face
to
me
;
it
seemed
to
me
that
*NL*
the
portrait-face
was
calling
to
me
for
help
.
I
--
I
shall
respect
you
all
*NL*
my
life
,
Nastasia
Philipovna
,
''
concluded
the
prince
,
as
though
suddenly
*NL*
recollecting
himself
,
and
blushing
to
think
of
the
sort
of
company
*NL*
before
whom
he
had
said
all
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ptitsin
bowed
his
head
and
looked
at
the
ground
,
overcome
by
a
mixture
*NL*
of
feelings
.
Totski
muttered
to
himself
:
``
He
may
be
an
idiot
,
but
he
*NL*
knows
that
flattery
is
the
best
road
to
success
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
observed
Gania
's
eyes
flashing
at
him
,
as
though
they
would
*NL*
gladly
annihilate
him
then
and
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
kind-hearted
man
,
if
you
like
,
''
said
Daria
Alexeyevna
,
whose
*NL*
wrath
was
quickly
evaporating
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
refined
man
,
but
--
lost
,
''
murmured
the
general
.
*NL*
*NL*
Totski
took
his
hat
and
rose
to
go
.
He
and
the
general
exchanged
*NL*
glances
,
making
a
private
arrangement
,
thereby
,
to
leave
the
house
*NL*
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
prince
;
no
one
has
ever
spoken
to
me
like
that
before
,
''
*NL*
began
Nastasia
Philipovna
.
``
Men
have
always
bargained
for
me
,
before
*NL*
this
;
and
not
a
single
respectable
man
has
ever
proposed
to
marry
me
.
Do
*NL*
you
hear
,
Afanasy
Ivanovitch
?
What
do
_
you
_
think
of
what
the
prince
has
*NL*
just
been
saying
?
It
was
almost
immodest
,
was
n't
it
?
You
,
Rogojin
,
wait
*NL*
a
moment
,
do
n't
go
yet
!
I
see
you
do
n't
intend
to
move
however
.
Perhaps
*NL*
I
may
go
with
you
yet
.
Where
did
you
mean
to
take
me
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
Ekaterinhof
,
''
replied
Lebedeff
.
Rogojin
simply
stood
staring
,
with
*NL*
trembling
lips
,
not
daring
to
believe
his
ears
.
He
was
stunned
,
as
*NL*
though
from
a
blow
on
the
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
thinking
of
,
my
dear
Nastasia
?
''
said
Daria
Alexeyevna
in
*NL*
alarm
.
``
What
are
you
saying
?
''
``
You
are
not
going
mad
,
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nastasia
Philipovna
burst
out
laughing
and
jumped
up
from
the
sofa
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
thought
I
should
accept
this
good
child
's
invitation
to
ruin
*NL*
him
,
did
you
?
''
she
cried
.
``
That
's
Totski
's
way
,
not
mine
.
He
's
fond
of
*NL*
children
.
Come
along
,
Rogojin
,
get
your
money
ready
!
We
wo
n't
talk
about
*NL*
marrying
just
at
this
moment
,
but
let
's
see
the
money
at
all
events
.
*NL*
Come
!
I
may
not
marry
you
,
either
.
I
do
n't
know
.
I
suppose
you
thought
*NL*
you
'd
keep
the
money
,
if
I
did
!
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
nonsense
!
I
have
no
sense
of
*NL*
shame
left
.
I
tell
you
I
have
been
Totski
's
concubine
.
Prince
,
you
*NL*
must
marry
Aglaya
Ivanovna
,
not
Nastasia
Philipovna
,
or
this
fellow
*NL*
Ferdishenko
will
always
be
pointing
the
finger
of
scorn
at
you
.
You
*NL*
are
n't
afraid
,
I
know
;
but
I
should
always
be
afraid
that
I
had
ruined
*NL*
you
,
and
that
you
would
reproach
me
for
it
.
As
for
what
you
say
about
*NL*
my
doing
you
honour
by
marrying
you-well
,
Totski
can
tell
you
all
about
*NL*
that
.
You
had
your
eye
on
Aglaya
,
Gania
,
you
know
you
had
;
and
you
might
*NL*
have
married
her
if
you
had
not
come
bargaining
.
You
are
all
like
*NL*
this
.
You
should
choose
,
once
for
all
,
between
disreputable
women
,
and
*NL*
respectable
ones
,
or
you
are
sure
to
get
mixed
.
Look
at
the
general
,
how
*NL*
he
's
staring
at
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
too
horrible
,
''
said
the
general
,
starting
to
his
feet
.
All
were
*NL*
standing
up
now
.
Nastasia
was
absolutely
beside
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
proud
,
in
spite
of
what
I
am
,
''
she
continued
.
``
You
called
me
*NL*
`
perfection
'
just
now
,
prince
.
A
nice
sort
of
perfection
to
throw
up
a
*NL*
prince
and
a
million
and
a
half
of
roubles
in
order
to
be
able
to
boast
*NL*
of
the
fact
afterwards
!
What
sort
of
a
wife
should
I
make
for
you
,
after
*NL*
all
I
have
said
?
Afanasy
Ivanovitch
,
do
you
observe
I
have
really
and
*NL*
truly
thrown
away
a
million
of
roubles
?
And
you
thought
that
I
should
*NL*
consider
your
wretched
seventy-five
thousand
,
with
Gania
thrown
in
for
a
*NL*
husband
,
a
paradise
of
bliss
!
Take
your
seventy-five
thousand
back
,
sir
;
*NL*
you
did
not
reach
the
hundred
thousand
.
Rogojin
cut
a
better
dash
than
*NL*
you
did
.
I
'll
console
Gania
myself
;
I
have
an
idea
about
that
.
But
now
I
*NL*
must
be
off
!
I
've
been
in
prison
for
ten
years
.
I
'm
free
at
last
!
Well
,
*NL*
Rogojin
,
what
are
you
waiting
for
?
Let
's
get
ready
and
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
along
!

shouted
Rogojin
,
beside
himself
with
joy
.
``
Hey
!
all
of
you
*NL*
fellows
!
Wine
!
Round
with
it
!
Fill
the
glasses
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
away
!
''
he
shouted
frantically
,
observing
that
Daria
Alexeyevna
*NL*
was
approaching
to
protest
against
Nastasia
's
conduct
.
``
Get
away

she
's
*NL*
mine

everything
's
mine

She
's

*NL*
*NL*
He
was
panting
with
ecstasy
.
He
walked
round
and
round
Nastasia
*NL*
Philipovna
and
told
everybody
to
``
keep
their
distance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
Rogojin
company
were
now
collected
in
the
drawing-room
;
some
*NL*
were
drinking
,
some
laughed
and
talked
:
all
were
in
the
highest
and
*NL*
wildest
spirits
.
Ferdishenko
was
doing
his
best
to
unite
himself
to
*NL*
them
;
the
general
and
Totski
again
made
an
attempt
to
go
.
Gania
,
too
*NL*
stood
hat
in
hand
ready
to
go
;
but
seemed
to
be
unable
to
tear
his
eyes
*NL*
away
from
the
scene
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
out
,
keep
your
distance
!
''
shouted
Rogojin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
shouting
about
there
!
''
cried
Nastasia
``
I
'm
not
yours
yet

*NL*
I
may
kick
you
out
for

your

*NL*
there
it
all
is
on
the
table

Here

Is
there

you
surely
did
not
expect
me
*NL*
to
ruin

him
?

-LRB-
indicating
the
prince
-RRB-
.
``
Fancy
him
nursing
me
!
Why
,
he
*NL*
needs
a
nurse
himself
!
The
general

there
,
will
be
his
nurse
now
,
you
'll
*NL*
see
.
Here
,
prince
,
look
here
!
Your
bride
is
accepting
money
.
What
a
*NL*
disreputable
woman
she
must
be
!
And
you
wished
to
marry
her
!
What
are
*NL*
you
crying
about
?
Is
it
a
bitter
dose
?
Never
mind
,
you
shall
laugh
yet
.
*NL*
Trust
to
time

-LRB-
In
spite
of
these
words
there
were
two
large
tears
*NL*
rolling
down
Nastasia
's
own
cheeks
.
-RRB-
``
It
's
far
better
to
think
twice
*NL*
of
it
now
than
afterwards
.
Oh
!
you
must
n't
cry
like
that
!
There
's
Katia
*NL*
crying
,
too
.
What
is
it
,
Katia
,
dear
?
I
shall
leave
you
and
Pasha
a
lot
*NL*
of
things
,
I
've
laid
them
out
for
you
already
;
but
good-bye
,
now
.
I
made
*NL*
an
honest
girl
like
you
serve
a
low
woman
like
myself
.
It
's
better
so
,
*NL*
prince
,
it
is
indeed
.
You
'd
begin
to
despise
me
afterwards
--
we
should
*NL*
never
be
happy
.
Oh
!
you
need
n't
swear
,
prince
,
I
sha
n't
believe
you
,
you
*NL*
know
.
How
foolish
it
would
be
,
too
!
No
,
no
;
we
'd
better
say
good-bye
and
*NL*
part
friends
.
I
am
a
bit
of
a
dreamer
myself
,
and
I
used
to
dream
of
you
*NL*
once
.
Very
often
during
those
five
years
down
at
his
estate
I
used
to
*NL*
dream
and
think
,
and
I
always
imagined
just
such
a
good
,
honest
,
foolish
*NL*
fellow
as
you
,
one
who
should
come
and
say
to
me
:
`
You
are
an
innocent
*NL*
woman
,
Nastasia
Philipovna
,
and
I
adore
you
.
'
I
dreamt
of
you
often
.
I
*NL*
used
to
think
so
much
down
there
that
I
nearly
went
mad
;
and
then
this
*NL*
fellow
here
would
come
down
.
He
would
stay
a
couple
of
months
out
of
the
*NL*
twelve
,
and
disgrace
and
insult
and
deprave
me
,
and
then
go
;
so
that
I
*NL*
longed
to
drown
myself
in
the
pond
a
thousand
times
over
;
but
I
did
not
*NL*
dare
do
it
.
I
had
n't
the
heart
,
and
now
--
well
,
are
you
ready
,
Rogojin
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ready

keep
your
distance

all
of
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
're
all
ready

said
several
of
his
friends
.
``
The
troikas

Sledges

*NL*
*NL*
Nastasia
Philipovna
seized
the
packet
of
bank-notes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gania

I
have
an
idea

I
wish

recompense

why
should
you

lose

Rogojin

would
he
crawl
for
three
roubles
as
far
as
the
*NL*
Vassiliostrof

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

look

I

You

worried
me

Do
you
see

It

Now
,
I
'm
going
to
throw
it
into
the
fire

here

before
all
these

witnesses

As
soon
as
the
fire
catches
hold
of
it

you
put
your
hands
*NL*
into
the
fire
and
pick
it
out

without
gloves

you
know

You
must
have
*NL*
bare
hands

and
you
must
turn
your
sleeves
up

Pull
it
out

I

*NL*
it

all
yours

You

then

it

take
you
long

lay

it

snatch
it
out

I
shall
so
much
admire
you

you
put
your

All
here

out

If

it

burn

I

said
*NL*
Ferdishenko
,
astounded
and
helpless
with
bewilderment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense

''
cried
Nastasia
Philipovna
,
seizing
the
poker
and
raking
a
*NL*
couple
of
logs
together
.
No
sooner
did
a
tongue
of
flame
burst
out
than
*NL*
she
threw
the
packet
of
notes
upon
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everyone
gasped
;
some
even
crossed
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
mad

she

mad

was
the
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ought

ought
n't
we
to
secure
her

asked
the
general
of
Ptitsin
,
in
*NL*
a
whisper
;
``
or
shall
we
send
for
the
authorities

Why

mad

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
N-no

I
hardly
think
she
is
actually
mad

''
whispered
Ptitsin
,
who
was
*NL*
as
white
as
his
handkerchief
,
and
trembling
like
a
leaf
.
He
could
not
*NL*
take
his
eyes
off
the
smouldering
packet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
mad
surely
,
is
n't
she

''
the
general
appealed
to
Totski
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
you
she
was

replied
the
latter

who
was
*NL*
as
pale
as
anyone

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

positively

you

a

*NL*
*NL*
``
Goodness
gracious

good
heavens

''
came
from
all
quarters
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
now
crowded
round
the
fire
and
thronged
to
see
what
was
going
on
;
*NL*
everyone
lamented
and
gave
vent
to
exclamations
of
horror
and
woe
.
Some
*NL*
jumped
up
on
chairs
in
order
to
get
a
better
view
.
Daria
Alexeyevna
*NL*
ran
into
the
next
room
and
whispered
excitedly
to
Katia
and
Pasha
.
The
*NL*
beautiful
German
disappeared
altogether
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
lady
!
my
sovereign
!
''
lamented
Lebedeff
,
falling
on
his
knees
before
*NL*
Nastasia
Philipovna
,
and
stretching
out
his
hands
towards
the
fire
;
*NL*
``
it
's
a
hundred
thousand
roubles

it
is
indeed
,
I
packed
it
up
myself

*NL*

saw
the
money
!
My
queen
,
let
me
get
into
the
fire
after
it
--
say
the
*NL*
word-I
'll
put
my
whole
grey
head
into
the
fire
for
it
!
I
have
a
poor
*NL*
lame
wife
and
thirteen
children
.
My
father
died
of
starvation
last
week
.
*NL*
Nastasia
Philipovna
,
Nastasia
Philipovna
!
''
The
wretched
little
man
wept
,
*NL*
and
groaned
,
and
crawled
towards
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Away
,
out
of
the
way
!
''
cried
Nastasia
.
``
Make
room
,
all
of
you
!
Gania
,
*NL*
what
are
you
standing
there
for
?
Do
n't
stand
on
ceremony
.
Put
in
your
*NL*
hand
!
There
's
your
whole
happiness
smouldering
away
,
look
!
Quick
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Gania
had
borne
too
much
that
day
,
and
especially
this
evening
,
and
*NL*
he
was
not
prepared
for
this
last
,
quite
unexpected
trial
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
crowd
parted
on
each
side
of
him
and
he
was
left
face
to
face
with
*NL*
Nastasia
Philipovna
,
three
paces
from
her
.
She
stood
by
the
fire
and
*NL*
waited
,
with
her
intent
gaze
fixed
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gania
stood
before
her
,
in
his
evening
clothes
,
holding
his
white
gloves
*NL*
and
hat
in
his
hand
,
speechless
and
motionless
,
with
arms
folded
and
*NL*
eyes
fixed
on
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
silly
,
meaningless
smile
played
on
his
white
,
death-like
lips
.
He
*NL*
could
not
take
his
eyes
off
the
smouldering
packet
;
but
it
appeared
that
*NL*
something
new
had
come
to
birth
in
his
soul
--
as
though
he
were
vowing
to
*NL*
himself
that
he
would
bear
this
trial
.
He
did
not
move
from
his
place
.
*NL*
In
a
few
seconds
it
became
evident
to
all
that
he
did
not
intend
to
*NL*
rescue
the
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hey
!
look
at
it
,
it
'll
burn
in
another
minute
or
two
!
''
cried
Nastasia
*NL*
Philipovna
.
``
You
'll
hang
yourself
afterwards
,
you
know
,
if
it
does
!
I
'm
*NL*
not
joking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
fire
,
choked
between
a
couple
of
smouldering
pieces
of
wood
,
had
*NL*
died
down
for
the
first
few
moments
after
the
packet
was
thrown
upon
it
.
*NL*
But
a
little
tongue
of
fire
now
began
to
lick
the
paper
from
below
,
*NL*
and
soon
,
gathering
courage
,
mounted
the
sides
of
the
parcel
,
and
crept
*NL*
around
it
.
In
another
moment
,
the
whole
of
it
burst
into
flames
,
and
the
*NL*
exclamations
of
woe
and
horror
were
redoubled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nastasia
Philipovna
!
''
lamented
Lebedeff
again
,
straining
towards
the
*NL*
fireplace
;
but
Rogojin
dragged
him
away
,
and
pushed
him
to
the
rear
once
*NL*
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
of
Rogojin
's
being
was
concentrated
in
one
rapturous
gaze
of
*NL*
ecstasy
.
He
could
not
take
his
eyes
off
Nastasia
.
He
stood
drinking
her
*NL*
in
,
as
it
were
.
He
was
in
the
seventh
heaven
of
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
what
a
queen
she
is
!
''
he
ejaculated
,
every
other
minute
,
throwing
*NL*
out
the
remark
for
anyone
who
liked
to
catch
it
.
``
That
's
the
sort
of
*NL*
woman
for
me
!
Which
of
you
would
think
of
doing
a
thing
like
that
,
you
*NL*
blackguards
,
eh
?
''
he
yelled
.
He
was
hopelessly
and
wildly
beside
himself
*NL*
with
ecstasy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
watched
the
whole
scene
,
silent
and
dejected
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
pull
it
out
with
my
teeth
for
one
thousand
,
''
said
Ferdishenko
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
would
I
,
''
said
another
,
from
behind
,
``
with
pleasure
.
Devil
take
the
*NL*
thing
!
''
he
added
,
in
a
tempest
of
despair
,
``
it
will
all
be
burnt
up
in
a
*NL*
minute
--
It
's
burning
,
it
's
burning
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
burning
,
it
's
burning
!
''
cried
all
,
thronging
nearer
and
nearer
to
*NL*
the
fire
in
their
excitement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gania
,
do
n't
be
a
fool
!
I
tell
you
for
the
last
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
on
,
quick
!
''
shrieked
Ferdishenko
,
rushing
wildly
up
to
Gania
,
and
*NL*
trying
to
drag
him
to
the
fire
by
the
sleeve
of
his
coat
.
``
Get
it
,
you
*NL*
dummy
,
it
's
burning
away
fast
!
Oh
--
_
damn
_
the
thing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gania
hurled
Ferdishenko
from
him
;
then
he
turned
sharp
round
and
made
*NL*
for
the
door
.
But
he
had
not
gone
a
couple
of
steps
when
he
tottered
and
*NL*
fell
to
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
fainted
!
''
the
cry
went
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
money
's
burning
still
,
''
Lebedeff
lamented
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Burning
for
nothing

''
shouted
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Katia-Pasha
!
Bring
him
some
water
!
''
cried
Nastasia
Philipovna
.
Then
she
*NL*
took
the
tongs
and
fished
out
the
packet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nearly
the
whole
of
the
outer
covering
was
burned
away
,
but
it
was
*NL*
soon
evident
that
the
contents
were
hardly
touched
.
The
packet
had
been
*NL*
wrapped
in
a
threefold
covering
of
newspaper
,
and
the
notes
were
safe
.
*NL*
All
breathed
more
freely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
dirty
little
thousand
or
so
may
be
touched
,
''
said
Lebedeff
,
*NL*
immensely
relieved
,
``
but
there
's
very
little
harm
done
,
after
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
his
--
the
whole
packet
is
for
him

do
you
hear

all
of
you
?
''
*NL*
cried
Nastasia
Philipovna
,
placing
the
packet
by
the
side
of
Gania
.
*NL*
``
He
restrained
himself
,
and
did
n't
go
after
it
;
so
his
self-respect
is
*NL*
greater
than
his
thirst
for
money
.
All
right
--
he
'll
come
to
directly
--
he
*NL*
must
have
the
packet
or
he
'll
cut
his
throat
afterwards

There
!
He
's
*NL*
coming
to
himself

General

Totski

all
of
you

you
hear
me

The

money
is
all
Gania

give
it

fully
conscious

my
action

recompense

well

for
anything

best

Tell
him

lie
here
beside
him

Off

Goodbye

man

The
Rogojin
gang
followed
their
leader
and
Nastasia
Philipovna
to
the
*NL*
entrance-hall
,
laughing
and
shouting
and
whistling
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
hall
the
servants
were
waiting
,
and
handed
her
her
fur
cloak
.
*NL*
Martha
,
the
cook
,
ran
in
from
the
kitchen
.
Nastasia
kissed
them
all
*NL*
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
really
throwing
us
all
over
,
little
mother
?
Where
,
where
are
*NL*
you
going
to
?
And
on
your
birthday
,
too
!
''
cried
the
four
girls
,
crying
*NL*
over
her
and
kissing
her
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
out
into
the
world
,
Katia
;
perhaps
I
shall
be
a
laundress
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
.
No
more
of
Afanasy
Ivanovitch
,
anyhow
.
Give
him
my
respects
.
*NL*
Do
n't
think
badly
of
me
,
girls
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
hurried
down
to
the
front
gate
where
the
party
were
settling
*NL*
into
the
troikas
,
all
the
bells
tinkling
a
merry
accompaniment
the
*NL*
while
.
The
general
caught
him
up
on
the
stairs
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Prince
,
prince
!
''
he
cried
,
seizing
hold
of
his
arm
,
``
recollect
*NL*
yourself
!
Drop
her
,
prince
!
You
see
what
sort
of
a
woman
she
is
.
I
am
*NL*
speaking
to
you
like
a
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
glanced
at
him
,
but
said
nothing
.
He
shook
himself
free
,
and
*NL*
rushed
on
downstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
general
was
just
in
time
to
see
the
prince
take
the
first
sledge
he
*NL*
could
get
,
and
,
giving
the
order
to
Ekaterinhof
,
start
off
in
pursuit
*NL*
of
the
troikas
.
Then
the
general
's
fine
grey
horse
dragged
that
worthy
*NL*
home
,
with
some
new
thoughts
,
and
some
new
hopes
and
calculations
*NL*
developing
in
his
brain
,
and
with
the
pearls
in
his
pocket
,
for
he
had
*NL*
not
forgotten
to
bring
them
along
with
him
,
being
a
man
of
business
.
*NL*
Amid
his
new
thoughts
and
ideas
there
came
,
once
or
twice
,
the
image
of
*NL*
Nastasia
Philipovna
.
The
general
sighed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sorry
,
really
sorry
,
''
he
muttered
.
``
She
's
a
ruined
woman
.
Mad
!
mad
!
*NL*
However
,
the
prince
is
not
for
Nastasia
Philipovna
now
,
--
perhaps
it
's
as
*NL*
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Two
more
of
Nastasia
's
guests
,
who
walked
a
short
distance
together
,
*NL*
indulged
in
high
moral
sentiments
of
a
similar
nature
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
Totski
,
this
is
all
very
like
what
they
say
goes
on
*NL*
among
the
Japanese
?
''
said
Ptitsin
.
``
The
offended
party
there
,
they
say
,
*NL*
marches
off
to
his
insulter
and
says
to
him
,
`
You
insulted
me
,
so
I
have
*NL*
come
to
rip
myself
open
before
your
eyes
;
'
and
with
these
words
he
*NL*
does
actually
rip
his
stomach
open
before
his
enemy
,
and
considers
,
*NL*
doubtless
,
that
he
is
having
all
possible
and
necessary
satisfaction
and
*NL*
revenge
.
There
are
strange
characters
in
the
world
,
sir
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
H
'm
!
and
you
think
there
was
something
of
this
sort
here
,
do
you
?
Dear
*NL*
me
--
a
very
remarkable
comparison
,
you
know
!
But
you
must
have
observed
,
*NL*
my
dear
Ptitsin
,
that
I
did
all
I
possibly
could
.
I
could
do
no
more
*NL*
than
I
did
.
And
you
must
admit
that
there
are
some
rare
qualities
in
*NL*
this
woman
.
I
felt
I
could
not
speak
in
that
Bedlam
,
or
I
should
have
*NL*
been
tempted
to
cry
out
,
when
she
reproached
me
,
that
she
herself
was
*NL*
my
best
justification
.
Such
a
woman
could
make
anyone
forget
all
*NL*
reason
--
everything
!
Even
that
moujik
,
Rogojin
,
you
saw
,
brought
her
*NL*
a
hundred
thousand
roubles
!
Of
course
,
all
that
happened
tonight
*NL*
was
ephemeral
,
fantastic
,
unseemly
--
yet
it
lacked
neither
colour
nor
*NL*
originality
.
My
God
!
What
might
not
have
been
made
of
such
a
character
*NL*
combined
with
such
beauty
!
Yet
in
spite
of
all
efforts
--
in
spite
of
all
*NL*
education
,
even
--
all
those
gifts
are
wasted
!
She
is
an
uncut
diamond
...
*NL*
I
have
often
said
so
.

*NL*
*NL*
And
Afanasy
Ivanovitch
heaved
a
deep
sigh

PART
II
*NL*
*NL*
I.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
days
after
the
strange
conclusion
to
Nastasia
Philipovna
's
birthday
*NL*
party
,
with
the
record
of
which
we
concluded
the
first
part
of
this
*NL*
story
,
Prince
Muishkin
hurriedly
left
St.
Petersburg
for
Moscow
,
in
*NL*
order
to
see
after
some
business
connected
with
the
receipt
of
his
*NL*
unexpected
fortune
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
said
that
there
were
other
reasons
for
his
hurried
departure
;
but
*NL*
as
to
this
,
and
as
to
his
movements
in
Moscow
,
and
as
to
his
*NL*
prolonged
absence
from
St.
Petersburg
,
we
are
able
to
give
very
little
*NL*
information
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
was
away
for
six
months
,
and
even
those
who
were
most
*NL*
interested
in
his
destiny
were
able
to
pick
up
very
little
news
about
*NL*
him
all
that
while
.
True
,
certain
rumours
did
reach
his
friends
,
but
*NL*
these
were
both
strange
and
rare
,
and
each
one
contradicted
the
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
the
Epanchin
family
was
much
interested
in
his
movements
,
*NL*
though
he
had
not
had
time
to
bid
them
farewell
before
his
departure
.
*NL*
The
general
,
however
,
had
had
an
opportunity
of
seeing
him
once
or
twice
*NL*
since
the
eventful
evening
,
and
had
spoken
very
seriously
with
him
;
*NL*
but
though
he
had
seen
the
prince
,
as
I
say
,
he
told
his
family
nothing
*NL*
about
the
circumstance
.
In
fact
,
for
a
month
or
so
after
his
departure
*NL*
it
was
considered
not
the
thing
to
mention
the
prince
's
name
in
the
*NL*
Epanchin
household
.
Only
Mrs.
Epanchin
,
at
the
commencement
of
this
*NL*
period
,
had
announced
that
she
had
been
``
cruelly
mistaken
in
the
*NL*
prince
!
''
and
a
day
or
two
after
,
she
had
added
,
evidently
alluding
*NL*
to
him
,
but
not
mentioning
his
name
,
that
it
was
an
unalterable
*NL*
characteristic
of
hers
to
be
mistaken
in
people
.
Then
once
more
,
ten
*NL*
days
later
,
after
some
passage
of
arms
with
one
of
her
daughters
,
she
*NL*
had
remarked
sententiously
.
``
We
have
had
enough
of
mistakes
.
I
shall
be
*NL*
more
careful
in
future
!
''
However
,
it
was
impossible
to
avoid
remarking
*NL*
that
there
was
some
sense
of
oppression
in
the
household
--
something
*NL*
unspoken
,
but
felt
;
something
strained
.
All
the
members
of
the
family
*NL*
wore
frowning
looks
.
The
general
was
unusually
busy
;
his
family
hardly
*NL*
ever
saw
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
the
girls
,
nothing
was
said
openly
,
at
all
events
;
and
probably
*NL*
very
little
in
private
.
They
were
proud
damsels
,
and
were
not
always
*NL*
perfectly
confidential
even
among
themselves
.
But
they
understood
each
*NL*
other
thoroughly
at
the
first
word
on
all
occasions
;
very
often
at
the
*NL*
first
glance
,
so
that
there
was
no
need
of
much
talking
as
a
rule
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
fact
,
at
least
,
would
have
been
perfectly
plain
to
an
outsider
,
had
*NL*
any
such
person
been
on
the
spot
;
and
that
was
,
that
the
prince
had
made
*NL*
a
very
considerable
impression
upon
the
family
,
in
spite
of
the
fact
*NL*
that
he
had
but
once
been
inside
the
house
,
and
then
only
for
a
short
*NL*
time
.
Of
course
,
if
analyzed
,
this
impression
might
have
proved
to
be
*NL*
nothing
more
than
a
feeling
of
curiosity
;
but
be
it
what
it
might
,
there
*NL*
it
undoubtedly
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
by
little
,
the
rumours
spread
about
town
became
lost
in
a
maze
of
*NL*
uncertainty
.
It
was
said
that
some
foolish
young
prince
,
name
unknown
,
*NL*
had
suddenly
come
into
possession
of
a
gigantic
fortune
,
and
had
married
*NL*
a
French
ballet
dancer
.
This
was
contradicted
,
and
the
rumour
circulated
*NL*
that
it
was
a
young
merchant
who
had
come
into
the
enormous
fortune
and
*NL*
married
the
great
ballet
dancer
,
and
that
at
the
wedding
the
drunken
*NL*
young
fool
had
burned
seventy
thousand
roubles
at
a
candle
out
of
pure
*NL*
bravado
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
all
these
rumours
soon
died
down
,
to
which
circumstance
certain
*NL*
facts
largely
contributed
.
For
instance
,
the
whole
of
the
Rogojin
troop
*NL*
had
departed
,
with
him
at
their
head
,
for
Moscow
.
This
was
exactly
a
*NL*
week
after
a
dreadful
orgy
at
the
Ekaterinhof
gardens
,
where
Nastasia
*NL*
Philipovna
had
been
present
.
It
became
known
that
after
this
orgy
*NL*
Nastasia
Philipovna
had
entirely
disappeared
,
and
that
she
had
since
*NL*
been
traced
to
Moscow
;
so
that
the
exodus
of
the
Rogojin
band
was
found
*NL*
consistent
with
this
report
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
rumours
current
as
to
Gania
,
too
;
but
circumstances
soon
*NL*
contradicted
these
.
He
had
fallen
seriously
ill
,
and
his
illness
*NL*
precluded
his
appearance
in
society
,
and
even
at
business
,
for
over
a
*NL*
month
.
As
soon
as
he
had
recovered
,
however
,
he
threw
up
his
situation
*NL*
in
the
public
company
under
General
Epanchin
's
direction
,
for
some
*NL*
unknown
reason
,
and
the
post
was
given
to
another
.
He
never
went
*NL*
near
the
Epanchins
'
house
at
all
,
and
was
exceedingly
irritable
and
*NL*
depressed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Varvara
Ardalionovna
married
Ptitsin
this
winter
,
and
it
was
said
that
*NL*
the
fact
of
Gania
's
retirement
from
business
was
the
ultimate
cause
of
*NL*
the
marriage
,
since
Gania
was
now
not
only
unable
to
support
his
family
,
*NL*
but
even
required
help
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
may
mention
that
Gania
was
no
longer
mentioned
in
the
Epanchin
*NL*
household
any
more
than
the
prince
was
;
but
that
a
certain
circumstance
*NL*
in
connection
with
the
fatal
evening
at
Nastasia
's
house
became
known
*NL*
to
the
general
,
and
,
in
fact
,
to
all
the
family
the
very
next
day
.
This
*NL*
fact
was
that
Gania
had
come
home
that
night
,
but
had
refused
to
go
to
*NL*
bed
.
He
had
awaited
the
prince
's
return
from
Ekaterinhof
with
feverish
*NL*
impatience
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
latter
's
arrival
,
at
six
in
the
morning
,
Gania
had
gone
to
him
*NL*
in
his
room
,
bringing
with
him
the
singed
packet
of
money
,
which
he
had
*NL*
insisted
that
the
prince
should
return
to
Nastasia
Philipovna
without
*NL*
delay
.
It
was
said
that
when
Gania
entered
the
prince
's
room
,
he
came
*NL*
with
anything
but
friendly
feelings
,
and
in
a
condition
of
despair
and
*NL*
misery
;
but
that
after
a
short
conversation
,
he
had
stayed
on
for
a
*NL*
couple
of
hours
with
him
,
sobbing
continuously
and
bitterly
the
whole
*NL*
time
.
They
had
parted
upon
terms
of
cordial
friendship
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Epanchins
heard
about
this
,
as
well
as
about
the
episode
at
Nastasia
*NL*
Philipovna
's
.
It
was
strange
,
perhaps
,
that
the
facts
should
become
so
*NL*
quickly
,
and
fairly
accurately
,
known
.
As
far
as
Gania
was
concerned
,
*NL*
it
might
have
been
supposed
that
the
news
had
come
through
Varvara
*NL*
Ardalionovna
,
who
had
suddenly
become
a
frequent
visitor
of
the
Epanchin
*NL*
girls
,
greatly
to
their
mother
's
surprise
.
But
though
Varvara
had
seen
*NL*
fit
,
for
some
reason
,
to
make
friends
with
them
,
it
was
not
likely
*NL*
that
she
would
have
talked
to
them
about
her
brother
.
She
had
plenty
of
*NL*
pride
,
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
in
thus
acting
she
was
seeking
intimacy
*NL*
with
people
who
had
practically
shown
her
brother
the
door
.
She
and
the
*NL*
Epanchin
girls
had
been
acquainted
in
childhood
,
although
of
late
*NL*
they
had
met
but
rarely
.
Even
now
Varvara
hardly
ever
appeared
in
the
*NL*
drawing-room
,
but
would
slip
in
by
a
back
way
.
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
,
*NL*
who
disliked
Varvara
,
although
she
had
a
great
respect
for
her
mother
,
*NL*
was
much
annoyed
by
this
sudden
intimacy
,
and
put
it
down
to
the
general
*NL*
``
contrariness
''
of
her
daughters
,
who
were
``
always
on
the
lookout
for
*NL*
some
new
way
of
opposing
her
.
''
Nevertheless
,
Varvara
continued
her
*NL*
visits
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
month
after
Muishkin
's
departure
,
Mrs.
Epanchin
received
a
letter
from
*NL*
her
old
friend
Princess
Bielokonski
-LRB-
who
had
lately
left
for
Moscow
-RRB-
,
*NL*
which
letter
put
her
into
the
greatest
good
humour
.
She
did
not
divulge
*NL*
its
contents
either
to
her
daughters
or
the
general
,
but
her
conduct
*NL*
towards
the
former
became
affectionate
in
the
extreme
.
She
even
made
*NL*
some
sort
of
confession
to
them
,
but
they
were
unable
to
understand
what
*NL*
it
was
about
.
She
actually
relaxed
towards
the
general
a
little
--
he
had
*NL*
been
long
disgraced
--
and
though
she
managed
to
quarrel
with
them
all
the
*NL*
next
day
,
yet
she
soon
came
round
,
and
from
her
general
behaviour
it
was
*NL*
to
be
concluded
that
she
had
had
good
news
of
some
sort
,
which
she
would
*NL*
like
,
but
could
not
make
up
her
mind
,
to
disclose
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
a
week
later
she
received
another
letter
from
the
same
source
,
*NL*
and
at
last
resolved
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
solemnly
announced
that
she
had
heard
from
old
Princess
Bielokonski
,
*NL*
who
had
given
her
most
comforting
news
about
``
that
queer
young
prince
.
''
*NL*
Her
friend
had
hunted
him
up
,
and
found
that
all
was
going
well
with
*NL*
him
.
He
had
since
called
in
person
upon
her
,
making
an
extremely
*NL*
favourable
impression
,
for
the
princess
had
received
him
each
day
since
,
*NL*
and
had
introduced
him
into
several
good
houses
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
girls
could
see
that
their
mother
concealed
a
great
deal
from
them
,
*NL*
and
left
out
large
pieces
of
the
letter
in
reading
it
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
the
ice
was
broken
,
and
it
suddenly
became
possible
to
mention
*NL*
the
prince
's
name
again
.
And
again
it
became
evident
how
very
strong
was
*NL*
the
impression
the
young
man
had
made
in
the
household
by
his
one
visit
*NL*
there
.
Mrs.
Epanchin
was
surprised
at
the
effect
which
the
news
from
*NL*
Moscow
had
upon
the
girls
,
and
they
were
no
less
surprised
that
after
*NL*
solemnly
remarking
that
her
most
striking
characteristic
was
``
being
*NL*
mistaken
in
people
''
she
should
have
troubled
to
obtain
for
the
prince
*NL*
the
favour
and
protection
of
so
powerful
an
old
lady
as
the
Princess
*NL*
Bielokonski
.
As
soon
as
the
ice
was
thus
broken
,
the
general
lost
no
*NL*
time
in
showing
that
he
,
too
,
took
the
greatest
interest
in
the
subject
.
*NL*
He
admitted
that
he
was
interested
,
but
said
that
it
was
merely
in
the
*NL*
business
side
of
the
question
.
It
appeared
that
,
in
the
interests
of
*NL*
the
prince
,
he
had
made
arrangements
in
Moscow
for
a
careful
watch
to
be
*NL*
kept
upon
the
prince
's
business
affairs
,
and
especially
upon
Salaskin
.
*NL*
All
that
had
been
said
as
to
the
prince
being
an
undoubted
heir
to
a
*NL*
fortune
turned
out
to
be
perfectly
true
;
but
the
fortune
proved
to
be
*NL*
much
smaller
than
was
at
first
reported
.
The
estate
was
considerably
*NL*
encumbered
with
debts
;
creditors
turned
up
on
all
sides
,
and
the
prince
,
*NL*
in
spite
of
all
advice
and
entreaty
,
insisted
upon
managing
all
matters
*NL*
of
claim
himself
--
which
,
of
course
,
meant
satisfying
everybody
all
*NL*
round
,
although
half
the
claims
were
absolutely
fraudulent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Epanchin
confirmed
all
this
.
She
said
the
princess
had
written
to
*NL*
much
the
same
effect
,
and
added
that
there
was
no
curing
a
fool
.
But
*NL*
it
was
plain
,
from
her
expression
of
face
,
how
strongly
she
approved
of
*NL*
this
particular
young
fool
's
doings
.
In
conclusion
,
the
general
observed
*NL*
that
his
wife
took
as
great
an
interest
in
the
prince
as
though
he
were
*NL*
her
own
son
;
and
that
she
had
commenced
to
be
especially
affectionate
*NL*
towards
Aglaya
was
a
self-evident
fact
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
caused
the
general
to
look
grave
and
important
.
But
,
alas
!
this
*NL*
agreeable
state
of
affairs
very
soon
changed
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
couple
of
weeks
went
by
,
and
suddenly
the
general
and
his
wife
were
*NL*
once
more
gloomy
and
silent
,
and
the
ice
was
as
firm
as
ever
.
The
fact
*NL*
was
,
the
general
,
who
had
heard
first
,
how
Nastasia
Philipovna
had
fled
*NL*
to
Moscow
and
had
been
discovered
there
by
Rogojin
;
that
she
had
then
*NL*
disappeared
once
more
,
and
been
found
again
by
Rogojin
,
and
how
after
*NL*
that
she
had
almost
promised
to
marry
him
,
now
received
news
that
she
*NL*
had
once
more
disappeared
,
almost
on
the
very
day
fixed
for
her
wedding
,
*NL*
flying
somewhere
into
the
interior
of
Russia
this
time
,
and
that
*NL*
Prince
Muishkin
had
left
all
his
affairs
in
the
hands
of
Salaskin
and
*NL*
disappeared
also
--
but
whether
he
was
with
Nastasia
,
or
had
only
set
off
*NL*
in
search
of
her
,
was
unknown
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
received
confirmatory
news
from
the
princess
--
and
*NL*
alas
,
two
months
after
the
prince
's
first
departure
from
St.
Petersburg
,
*NL*
darkness
and
mystery
once
more
enveloped
his
whereabouts
and
actions
,
*NL*
and
in
the
Epanchin
family
the
ice
of
silence
once
more
formed
over
the
*NL*
subject
.
Varia
,
however
,
informed
the
girls
of
what
had
happened
,
she
*NL*
having
received
the
news
from
Ptitsin
,
who
generally
knew
more
than
most
*NL*
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
make
an
end
,
we
may
say
that
there
were
many
changes
in
the
Epanchin
*NL*
household
in
the
spring
,
so
that
it
was
not
difficult
to
forget
the
*NL*
prince
,
who
sent
no
news
of
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Epanchin
family
had
at
last
made
up
their
minds
to
spend
the
summer
*NL*
abroad
,
all
except
the
general
,
who
could
not
waste
time
in
``
travelling
*NL*
for
enjoyment
,
''
of
course
.
This
arrangement
was
brought
about
by
the
*NL*
persistence
of
the
girls
,
who
insisted
that
they
were
never
allowed
*NL*
to
go
abroad
because
their
parents
were
too
anxious
to
marry
them
off
.
*NL*
Perhaps
their
parents
had
at
last
come
to
the
conclusion
that
husbands
*NL*
might
be
found
abroad
,
and
that
a
summer
's
travel
might
bear
fruit
.
The
*NL*
marriage
between
Alexandra
and
Totski
had
been
broken
off
.
Since
the
*NL*
prince
's
departure
from
St.
Petersburg
no
more
had
been
said
about
it
;
*NL*
the
subject
had
been
dropped
without
ceremony
,
much
to
the
joy
of
Mrs.
*NL*
General
,
who
,
announced
that
she
was
``
ready
to
cross
herself
with
both
*NL*
hands
''
in
gratitude
for
the
escape
.
The
general
,
however
,
regretted
*NL*
Totski
for
a
long
while
.
``
Such
a
fortune
!
''
he
sighed
,
``
and
such
a
good
,
*NL*
easy-going
fellow
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
time
it
became
known
that
Totski
had
married
a
French
marquise
,
*NL*
and
was
to
be
carried
off
by
her
to
Paris
,
and
then
to
Brittany
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
,
''
thought
the
general
,
``
he
's
lost
to
us
for
good
,
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
Epanchins
prepared
to
depart
for
the
summer
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
now
another
circumstance
occurred
,
which
changed
all
the
plans
once
*NL*
more
,
and
again
the
intended
journey
was
put
off
,
much
to
the
delight
of
*NL*
the
general
and
his
spouse
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
certain
Prince
S
--
arrived
in
St.
Petersburg
from
Moscow
,
an
eminent
*NL*
and
honourable
young
man
.
He
was
one
of
those
active
persons
who
always
*NL*
find
some
good
work
with
which
to
employ
themselves
.
Without
forcing
*NL*
himself
upon
the
public
notice
,
modest
and
unobtrusive
,
this
young
*NL*
prince
was
concerned
with
much
that
happened
in
the
world
in
general
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
served
,
at
first
,
in
one
of
the
civil
departments
,
had
then
*NL*
attended
to
matters
connected
with
the
local
government
of
provincial
*NL*
towns
,
and
had
of
late
been
a
corresponding
member
of
several
important
*NL*
scientific
societies
.
He
was
a
man
of
excellent
family
and
solid
means
,
*NL*
about
thirty-five
years
of
age
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
S
--
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
general
's
family
,
and
*NL*
Adelaida
,
the
second
girl
,
made
a
great
impression
upon
him
.
Towards
*NL*
the
spring
he
proposed
to
her
,
and
she
accepted
him
.
The
general
and
his
*NL*
wife
were
delighted
.
The
journey
abroad
was
put
off
,
and
the
wedding
was
*NL*
fixed
for
a
day
not
very
distant
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
trip
abroad
might
have
been
enjoyed
later
on
by
Mrs.
Epanchin
and
*NL*
her
two
remaining
daughters
,
but
for
another
circumstance
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
so
happened
that
Prince
S
--
introduced
a
distant
relation
of
his
*NL*
own
into
the
Epanchin
family
--
one
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
,
a
young
officer
*NL*
of
about
twenty-eight
years
of
age
,
whose
conquests
among
the
ladies
in
*NL*
Moscow
had
been
proverbial
.
This
young
gentleman
no
sooner
set
eyes
on
*NL*
Aglaya
than
he
became
a
frequent
visitor
at
the
house
.
He
was
witty
,
*NL*
well-educated
,
and
extremely
wealthy
,
as
the
general
very
soon
*NL*
discovered
.
His
past
reputation
was
the
only
thing
against
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
was
said
;
there
were
not
even
any
hints
dropped
;
but
still
,
it
*NL*
seemed
better
to
the
parents
to
say
nothing
more
about
going
abroad
*NL*
this
season
,
at
all
events
.
Aglaya
herself
perhaps
was
of
a
different
*NL*
opinion
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
happened
just
before
the
second
appearance
of
our
hero
upon
the
*NL*
scene
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
,
to
judge
from
appearances
,
poor
Prince
Muishkin
had
been
*NL*
quite
forgotten
in
St.
Petersburg
.
If
he
had
appeared
suddenly
among
his
*NL*
acquaintances
,
he
would
have
been
received
as
one
from
the
skies
;
but
we
*NL*
must
just
glance
at
one
more
fact
before
we
conclude
this
preface
.
*NL*
*NL*
Colia
Ivolgin
,
for
some
time
after
the
prince
's
departure
,
continued
his
*NL*
old
life
.
That
is
,
he
went
to
school
,
looked
after
his
father
,
helped
*NL*
Varia
in
the
house
,
and
ran
her
errands
,
and
went
frequently
to
see
his
*NL*
friend
,
Hippolyte
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lodgers
had
disappeared
very
quickly
--
Ferdishenko
soon
after
the
*NL*
events
at
Nastasia
Philipovna
's
,
while
the
prince
went
to
Moscow
,
as
*NL*
we
know
.
Gania
and
his
mother
went
to
live
with
Varia
and
Ptitsin
*NL*
immediately
after
the
latter
's
wedding
,
while
the
general
was
housed
*NL*
in
a
debtor
's
prison
by
reason
of
certain
IOU
's
given
to
the
captain
's
*NL*
widow
under
the
impression
that
they
would
never
be
formally
*NL*
used
against
him
.
This
unkind
action
much
surprised
poor
Ardalion
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
,
the
victim
,
as
he
called
himself
,
of
an
``
unbounded
trust
*NL*
in
the
nobility
of
the
human
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
signed
those
notes
of
hand
he
never
dreamt
that
they
would
be
a
*NL*
source
of
future
trouble
.
The
event
showed
that
he
was
mistaken
.
``
Trust
*NL*
in
anyone
after
this
!
Have
the
least
confidence
in
man
or
woman
!
''
he
*NL*
cried
in
bitter
tones
,
as
he
sat
with
his
new
friends
in
prison
,
and
*NL*
recounted
to
them
his
favourite
stories
of
the
siege
of
Kars
,
and
the
*NL*
resuscitated
soldier
.
On
the
whole
,
he
accommodated
himself
very
well
*NL*
to
his
new
position
.
Ptitsin
and
Varia
declared
that
he
was
in
the
right
*NL*
place
,
and
Gania
was
of
the
same
opinion
.
The
only
person
who
deplored
*NL*
his
fate
was
poor
Nina
Alexandrovna
,
who
wept
bitter
tears
over
him
,
*NL*
to
the
great
surprise
of
her
household
,
and
,
though
always
in
feeble
*NL*
health
,
made
a
point
of
going
to
see
him
as
often
as
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
the
general
's
``
mishap
,
''
as
Colia
called
it
,
and
the
marriage
of
*NL*
his
sister
,
the
boy
had
quietly
possessed
himself
of
far
more
freedom
.
*NL*
His
relations
saw
little
of
him
,
for
he
rarely
slept
at
home
.
He
made
*NL*
many
new
friends
;
and
was
moreover
,
a
frequent
visitor
at
the
debtor
's
*NL*
prison
,
to
which
he
invariably
accompanied
his
mother
.
Varia
,
who
used
*NL*
to
be
always
correcting
him
,
never
spoke
to
him
now
on
the
subject
of
*NL*
his
frequent
absences
,
and
the
whole
household
was
surprised
to
see
*NL*
Gania
,
in
spite
of
his
depression
,
on
quite
friendly
terms
with
his
*NL*
brother
.
This
was
something
new
,
for
Gania
had
been
wont
to
look
upon
*NL*
Colia
as
a
kind
of
errand-boy
,
treating
him
with
contempt
,
threatening
*NL*
to
``
pull
his
ears
,
''
and
in
general
driving
him
almost
wild
with
*NL*
irritation
.
It
seemed
now
that
Gania
really
needed
his
brother
,
and
the
*NL*
latter
,
for
his
part
,
felt
as
if
he
could
forgive
Gania
much
since
he
*NL*
had
returned
the
hundred
thousand
roubles
offered
to
him
by
Nastasia
*NL*
Philipovna
.
Three
months
after
the
departure
of
the
prince
,
the
Ivolgin
*NL*
family
discovered
that
Colia
had
made
acquaintance
with
the
Epanchins
,
*NL*
and
was
on
very
friendly
terms
with
the
daughters
.
Varia
heard
of
it
*NL*
first
,
though
Colia
had
not
asked
her
to
introduce
him
.
Little
by
little
*NL*
the
family
grew
quite
fond
of
him
.
Madame
Epanchin
at
first
looked
on
*NL*
him
with
disdain
,
and
received
him
coldly
,
but
in
a
short
time
he
*NL*
grew
to
please
her
,
because
,
as
she
said
,
he
``
was
candid
and
no
*NL*
flatterer
''
--
a
very
true
description
.
From
the
first
he
put
himself
*NL*
on
an
equality
with
his
new
friends
,
and
though
he
sometimes
read
*NL*
newspapers
and
books
to
the
mistress
of
the
house
,
it
was
simply
because
*NL*
he
liked
to
be
useful
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
however
,
he
and
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
quarrelled
seriously
*NL*
about
the
``
woman
question
,
''
in
the
course
of
a
lively
discussion
on
that
*NL*
burning
subject
.
He
told
her
that
she
was
a
tyrant
,
and
that
he
would
*NL*
never
set
foot
in
her
house
again
.
It
may
seem
incredible
,
but
a
day
*NL*
or
two
after
,
Madame
Epanchin
sent
a
servant
with
a
note
begging
him
to
*NL*
return
,
and
Colia
,
without
standing
on
his
dignity
,
did
so
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aglaya
was
the
only
one
of
the
family
whose
good
graces
he
could
not
*NL*
gain
,
and
who
always
spoke
to
him
haughtily
,
but
it
so
happened
that
the
*NL*
boy
one
day
succeeded
in
giving
the
proud
maiden
a
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
about
Easter
,
when
,
taking
advantage
of
a
momentary
tete-a-tete
*NL*
Colia
handed
Aglaya
a
letter
,
remarking
that
he
``
had
orders
to
deliver
*NL*
it
to
her
privately
.
''
She
stared
at
him
in
amazement
,
but
he
did
not
*NL*
wait
to
hear
what
she
had
to
say
,
and
went
out
.
Aglaya
broke
the
seal
,
*NL*
and
read
as
follows
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Once
you
did
me
the
honour
of
giving
me
your
confidence
.
Perhaps
you
*NL*
have
quite
forgotten
me
now
!
How
is
it
that
I
am
writing
to
you
?
I
do
*NL*
not
know
;
but
I
am
conscious
of
an
irresistible
desire
to
remind
you
of
*NL*
my
existence
,
especially
you
.
How
many
times
I
have
needed
all
three

I
need

I
need

you
very
much

I
will
not
write
about

I
have
nothing
to

*NL*
you

But
I
long
for
you
to
be
happy

_
Are
_
you
happy

That
is
all
I
wished
*NL*
to
say
to
you

On
reading
this
short
and
disconnected
note
,
Aglaya
suddenly
blushed
all
*NL*
over
,
and
became
very
thoughtful
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
be
difficult
to
describe
her
thoughts
at
that
moment
.
One
of
*NL*
them
was
,
``
Shall
I
show
it
to
anyone
?
''
But
she
was
ashamed
to
show
it
.
*NL*
So
she
ended
by
hiding
it
in
her
table
drawer
,
with
a
very
strange
,
*NL*
ironical
smile
upon
her
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
,
she
took
it
out
,
and
put
it
into
a
large
book
,
as
she
usually
*NL*
did
with
papers
which
she
wanted
to
be
able
to
find
easily
.
She
laughed
*NL*
when
,
about
a
week
later
,
she
happened
to
notice
the
name
of
the
book
,
*NL*
and
saw
that
it
was
Don
Quixote
,
but
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
*NL*
exactly
why
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
can
not
say
,
either
,
whether
she
showed
the
letter
to
her
sisters
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
she
had
read
it
herself
once
more
,
it
suddenly
struck
her
*NL*
that
surely
that
conceited
boy
,
Colia
,
had
not
been
the
one
chosen
*NL*
correspondent
of
the
prince
all
this
while
.
She
determined
to
ask
him
,
*NL*
and
did
so
with
an
exaggerated
show
of
carelessness
.
He
informed
her
*NL*
haughtily
that
though
he
had
given
the
prince
his
permanent
address
when
*NL*
the
latter
left
town
,
and
had
offered
his
services
,
the
prince
had
never
*NL*
before
given
him
any
commission
to
perform
,
nor
had
he
written
until
the
*NL*
following
lines
arrived
,
with
Aglaya
's
letter
.
Aglaya
took
the
note
,
and
*NL*
read
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
DEAR
COLIA
,
--
Please
be

kind
as

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
absurd
to
trust
a
little
pepper-box
like
you
,
''
said
Aglaya
,
*NL*
as
she
returned
the
note
,
and
walked
past
the
``
pepper-box
''
with
an
*NL*
expression
of
great
contempt
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
more
than
Colia
could
bear
.
He
had
actually
borrowed
Gania
's
*NL*
new
green
tie
for
the
occasion
,
without
saying
why
he
wanted
it
,
in
*NL*
order
to
impress
her
.
He
was
very
deeply
mortified
.

*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
beginning
of
June
,
and
for
a
whole
week
the
weather
in
*NL*
St.
Petersburg
had
been
magnificent
.
The
Epanchins
had
a
luxurious
*NL*
country-house
at
Pavlofsk
,
-LSB-
One
of
the
fashionable
summer
resorts
near
*NL*
St.
Petersburg
.
-RSB-
and
to
this
spot
Mrs.
Epanchin
determined
to
proceed
*NL*
without
further
delay
.
In
a
couple
of
days
all
was
ready
,
and
the
family
*NL*
had
left
town
.
A
day
or
two
after
this
removal
to
Pavlofsk
,
Prince
*NL*
Muishkin
arrived
in
St.
Petersburg
by
the
morning
train
from
Moscow
.
No
*NL*
one
met
him
;
but
,
as
he
stepped
out
of
the
carriage
,
he
suddenly
became
*NL*
aware
of
two
strangely
glowing
eyes
fixed
upon
him
from
among
the
crowd
*NL*
that
met
the
train
.
On
endeavouring
to
re-discover
the
eyes
,
and
see
*NL*
to
whom
they
belonged
,
he
could
find
nothing
to
guide
him
.
It
must
have
*NL*
been
a
hallucination
.
But
the
disagreeable
impression
remained
,
and
*NL*
without
this
,
the
prince
was
sad
and
thoughtful
already
,
and
seemed
to
*NL*
be
much
preoccupied
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
cab
took
him
to
a
small
and
bad
hotel
near
the
Litaynaya
.
Here
*NL*
he
engaged
a
couple
of
rooms
,
dark
and
badly
furnished
.
He
washed
and
*NL*
changed
,
and
hurriedly
left
the
hotel
again
,
as
though
anxious
to
*NL*
waste
no
time
.
Anyone
who
now
saw
him
for
the
first
time
since
he
*NL*
left
Petersburg
would
judge
that
he
had
improved
vastly
so
far
as
his
*NL*
exterior
was
concerned
.
His
clothes
certainly
were
very
different
;
they
*NL*
were
more
fashionable
,
perhaps
even
too
much
so
,
and
anyone
inclined
to
*NL*
mockery
might
have
found
something
to
smile
at
in
his
appearance
.
But
*NL*
what
is
there
that
people
will
not
smile
at
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
took
a
cab
and
drove
to
a
street
near
the
Nativity
,
where
he
*NL*
soon
discovered
the
house
he
was
seeking
.
It
was
a
small
wooden
villa
,
*NL*
and
he
was
struck
by
its
attractive
and
clean
appearance
;
it
stood
in
*NL*
a
pleasant
little
garden
,
full
of
flowers
.
The
windows
looking
on
the
*NL*
street
were
open
,
and
the
sound
of
a
voice
,
reading
aloud
or
making
*NL*
a
speech
,
came
through
them
.
It
rose
at
times
to
a
shout
,
and
was
*NL*
interrupted
occasionally
by
bursts
of
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Muishkin
entered
the
court-yard
,
and
ascended
the
steps
.
A
cook
*NL*
with
her
sleeves
turned
up
to
the
elbows
opened
the
door
.
The
visitor
*NL*
asked
if
Mr.
Lebedeff
were
at
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
in
there
,
''
said
she
,
pointing
to
the
salon
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
room
had
a
blue
wall-paper
,
and
was
well
,
almost
pretentiously
,
*NL*
furnished
,
with
its
round
table
,
its
divan
,
and
its
bronze
clock
under
*NL*
a
glass
shade
.
There
was
a
narrow
pier-glass
against
the
wall
,
and
a
*NL*
chandelier
adorned
with
lustres
hung
by
a
bronze
chain
from
the
ceiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
prince
entered
,
Lebedeff
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
*NL*
room
,
his
back
to
the
door
.
He
was
in
his
shirt-sleeves
,
on
account
of
*NL*
the
extreme
heat
,
and
he
seemed
to
have
just
reached
the
peroration
of
*NL*
his
speech
,
and
was
impressively
beating
his
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
audience
consisted
of
a
youth
of
about
fifteen
years
of
age
with
a
*NL*
clever
face
,
who
had
a
book
in
his
hand
,
though
he
was
not
reading
;
a
*NL*
young
lady
of
twenty
,
in
deep
mourning
,
stood
near
him
with
an
infant
in
*NL*
her
arms
;
another
girl
of
thirteen
,
also
in
black
,
was
laughing
loudly
,
*NL*
her
mouth
wide
open
;
and
on
the
sofa
lay
a
handsome
young
man
,
*NL*
with
black
hair
and
eyes
,
and
a
suspicion
of
beard
and
whiskers
.
He
*NL*
frequently
interrupted
the
speaker
and
argued
with
him
,
to
the
great
*NL*
delight
of
the
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lukian
Timofeyovitch
!
Lukian
Timofeyovitch
!
Here
's
someone
to
see
you
!
*NL*
Look
here
!
...
a
gentleman
to
speak
to
you
!
...
Well
,
it
's
not
my
fault
!
''
*NL*
and
the
cook
turned
and
went
away
red
with
anger
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lebedeff
started
,
and
at
sight
of
the
prince
stood
like
a
statue
for
a
*NL*
moment
.
Then
he
moved
up
to
him
with
an
ingratiating
smile
,
but
stopped
*NL*
short
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Prince
!
ex-ex-excellency
!
''
he
stammered
.
Then
suddenly
he
ran
towards
*NL*
the
girl
with
the
infant
,
a
movement
so
unexpected
by
her
that
she
*NL*
staggered
and
fell
back
,
but
next
moment
he
was
threatening
the
other
*NL*
child
,
who
was
standing
,
still
laughing
,
in
the
doorway
.
She
screamed
,
*NL*
and
ran
towards
the
kitchen
.
Lebedeff
stamped
his
foot
angrily
;
*NL*
then
,
seeing
the
prince
regarding
him
with
amazement
,
he
murmured
*NL*
apologetically
--
``
Pardon
to
show
respect
!
...
he-he
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
quite
wrong
...
''
began
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
once
...
at
once
...
in
one
moment
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
rushed
like
a
whirlwind
from
the
room
,
and
Muishkin
looked
*NL*
inquiringly
at
the
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
all
laughing
,
and
the
guest
joined
in
the
chorus
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
gone
to
get
his
coat
,
''
said
the
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
annoying
!
''
exclaimed
the
prince
.
``
I
thought
...
Tell
me
,
is
he
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
think
he
is
drunk
?
''
cried
the
young
man
on
the
sofa
.
``
Not
in
the
*NL*
least
.
He
's
only
had
three
or
four
small
glasses
,
perhaps
five
;
but
what
*NL*
is
that
?
The
usual
thing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
prince
opened
his
mouth
to
answer
,
he
was
interrupted
by
the
*NL*
girl
,
whose
sweet
face
wore
an
expression
of
absolute
frankness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
never
drinks
much
in
the
morning
;
if
you
have
come
to
talk
business
*NL*
with
him
,
do
it
now
.
It
is
the
best
time
.
He
sometimes
comes
back
drunk
*NL*
in
the
evening
;
but
just
now
he
passes
the
greater
part
of
the
evening
*NL*
in
tears
,
and
reads
passages
of
Holy
Scripture
aloud
,
because
our
mother
*NL*
died
five
weeks
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
doubt
he
ran
off
because
he
did
not
know
what
to
say
to
you
,
''
*NL*
said
the
youth
on
the
divan
.
``
I
bet
he
is
trying
to
cheat
you
,
and
is
*NL*
thinking
how
best
to
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Just
then
Lebedeff
returned
,
having
put
on
his
coat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Five
weeks
!
''
said
he
,
wiping
his
eyes
.
``
Only
five
weeks
!
Poor
orphans
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
wear
a
coat
in
holes

''
asked
the
girl
,
``
when
your
new
one
is
*NL*
hanging
behind
the
door
?
Did
you
not
see
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
your
tongue

he
scolded
.
``
What
a
plague
you
are

He
*NL*
stamped
his
foot
irritably
,
but
she
only
laughed
,
and
answered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
trying
to
frighten
me
?
I
am
not
Tania

you
know

and
I
do

intend
to
run
away

Look
,
you
are
waking
Lubotchka
,
and
she
will
have
*NL*
convulsions
again

Why
do
you
shout
like
that
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
!
I
wo
n't
again
,
''
said
the
master
of
the
house
his
anxiety
*NL*
getting
the
better
of
his
temper
.
He
went
up
to
his
daughter
,
and
looked
*NL*
at
the
child
in
her
arms
,
anxiously
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
over
*NL*
her
three
times
.
``
God
bless
her
!
God
bless
her
!
''
he
cried
with
emotion
.
*NL*
``
This
little
creature
is

daughter
Luboff
,
''
addressing
the
prince
.
``
My

``

*NL*
*NL*
``

cried
Lebedeff
,
all
of
a
sudden
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

Muishkin
,
with
some
surprise

``

asked
the
visitor

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
They
all
laughed
,
and
the
thought
crossed
the
prince
's
mind
that
perhaps
*NL*
Lebedeff
was
really
trifling
in
this
way
because
he
foresaw
inconvenient
*NL*
questions
,
and
wanted
to
gain
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
a
traitor
!
a
conspirator
!
''
shouted
Lebedeff
,
who
seemed
to
have
*NL*
lost
all
control
over
himself
.
``
A
monster
!
a
slanderer
!
Ought
I
to
treat
*NL*
him
as
a

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

play

prince

he
practices
speechifying

and
is
always
*NL*
repeating
his
eloquent
pleadings

And
who
do
you
think

last
client

had
been
robbed
of
five
hundred

roubles

her
all

by
some
rogue
of
a
usurer

besought
him
to
take
up
*NL*
her
case
,
instead
of
which
he
defended
the
usurer
himself
,
a
Jew
named
*NL*
Zeidler
,
because
this
Jew
promised
to
give
him
fifty
roubles

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
to
be
fifty

won

only
five

interrupted
*NL*
Lebedeff
,
speaking
in
a
low
tone

a
great
contrast
to
his
earlier
*NL*
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

naturally
he
came
to
grief

the

he
only
got
laughed

every
morning
he
recites
this
*NL*
speech
to
us
from
beginning
to
end
,
exactly
as
he
spoke
it
before
the
*NL*
magistrate
.
To-day
we
have
heard
it
for
the
fifth
time
.
He
was
just
*NL*
starting
again
when
you
arrived
,
so
much
does
he
admire
it
.
He
is
now
*NL*
preparing
to
undertake
another
case
.
I
think
,
by
the
way
,
that
you
are
*NL*
Prince
Muishkin
?
Colia
tells
me
you
are
the
cleverest
man
he
has
ever
*NL*
known
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
cleverest
in
the
world
,
''
interrupted
his
uncle
hastily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
pay
much
attention
to
that
opinion
,
''
continued
the
young
man
*NL*
calmly
.
``
Colia
is
very
fond
of
you
,
but
he
,
''
pointing
to
Lebedeff
,
``
is
*NL*
flattering
you
.
I
can
assure
you
I
have
no
intention
of
flattering
you
,
*NL*
or
anyone
else
,
but
at
least
you
have
some
common-sense
.
Well
,
will
you
*NL*
judge
between
us
?
Shall
we
ask
the
prince
to
act
as
arbitrator
?
''
he
went
*NL*
on
,
addressing
his
uncle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
so
glad
you
chanced
to
come
here
,
prince
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
agree
,
''
said
Lebedeff
,
firmly
,
looking
round
involuntarily
at
his
*NL*
daughter
,
who
had
come
nearer
,
and
was
listening
attentively
to
the
*NL*
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
all
about
?
''
asked
the
prince
,
frowning
.
His
head
ached
,
and
*NL*
he
felt
sure
that
Lebedeff
was
trying
to
cheat
him
in
some
way
,
and
only
*NL*
talking
to
put
off
the
explanation
that
he
had
come
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
tell
you
all
the
story
.
I
am
his
nephew
;
he
did
speak
the
truth
*NL*
there
,
although
he
is
generally
telling
lies
.
I
am
at
the
University
,
*NL*
and
have
not
yet
finished
my
course
.
I
mean
to
do
so
,
and
I
shall
,
for
*NL*
I
have
a
determined
character
.
I
must
,
however
,
find
something
to
do
*NL*
for
the
present
,
and
therefore
I
have
got
employment
on
the
railway
at
*NL*
twenty-four
roubles
a
month
.
I
admit
that
my
uncle
has
helped
me
once
*NL*
or
twice
before
.
Well
,
I
had
twenty
roubles
in
my
pocket
,
and
I
gambled
*NL*
them
away
.
Can
you
believe
that
I
should
be
so
low
,
so
base
,
as
to
lose
*NL*
money
in
that
way
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
man
who
won
it
is
a
rogue
,
a
rogue
whom
you
ought
not
to
have
*NL*
paid
!
''
cried
Lebedeff
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
he
is
a
rogue
,
but
I
was
obliged
to
pay
him
,
''
said
the
young
man
.
*NL*
``
As
to
his
being
a
rogue
,
he
is
assuredly
that
,
and
I
am
not
saying
it
*NL*
because
he
beat
you
.
He
is
an
ex-lieutenant
,
prince
,
dismissed
from
the
*NL*
service
,
a
teacher
of
boxing
,
and
one
of
Rogojin
's
followers
.
They
are
*NL*
all
lounging
about
the
pavements
now
that
Rogojin
has
turned
them
off
.
*NL*
Of
course
,
the
worst
of
it
is
that
,
knowing
he
was
a
rascal
,
and
a
*NL*
card-sharper
,
I
none
the
less
played
palki
with
him
,
and
risked
my
last
*NL*
rouble
.
To
tell
the
truth
,
I
thought
to
myself
,
`
If
I
lose
,
I
will
go
*NL*
to
my
uncle
,
and
I
am
sure
he
will
not
refuse
to
help
me
.
'
Now
that
was
*NL*
base-cowardly
and
base
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
so
,
''
observed
Lebedeff
quietly
;
``
cowardly
and
base
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
wait
a
bit
,
before
you
begin
to
triumph
,
''
said
the
nephew
*NL*
viciously
;
for
the
words
seemed
to
irritate
him
.
``
He
is
delighted
!
I
*NL*
came
to
him
here
and
told
him
everything
:
I
acted
honourably
,
for
I
did
*NL*
not
excuse
myself
.
I
spoke
most
severely
of
my
conduct
,
as
everyone
here
*NL*
can
witness
.
But
I
must
smarten
myself
up
before
I
take
up
my
new
post
,
*NL*
for
I
am
really
like
a
tramp
.
Just
look
at
my
boots
!
I
can
not
possibly
*NL*
appear
like
this
,
and
if
I
am
not
at
the
bureau
at
the
time
appointed
,
*NL*
the
job
will
be
given
to
someone
else
;
and
I
shall
have
to
try
for
*NL*
another
.
Now
I
only
beg
for
fifteen
roubles
,
and
I
give
my
word
that
*NL*
I
will
never
ask
him
for
anything
again
.
I
am
also
ready
to
promise
to
*NL*
repay
my
debt
in
three
months
'
time
,
and
I
will
keep
my
word
,
even
if
I
*NL*
have
to
live
on
bread
and
water
.
My
salary
will
amount
to
seventy-five
*NL*
roubles
in
three
months
.
The
sum
I
now
ask
,
added
to
what
I
have
*NL*
borrowed
already
,
will
make
a
total
of
about
thirty-five
roubles
,
so
*NL*
you
see
I
shall
have
enough
to
pay
him
and
confound
him
!
if
he
wants
*NL*
interest
,
he
shall
have
that
,
too
!
Have
n't
I
always
paid
back
the
money
*NL*
he
lent
me
before
?
Why
should
he
be
so
mean
now
?
He
grudges
my
having
*NL*
paid
that
lieutenant
;
there
can
be
no
other
reason
!
That
's
the
kind
he
*NL*
is
--
a
dog
in
the
manger
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
he
wo
n't
go
away
!
''
cried
Lebedeff
.
``
He
has
installed
himself
here
,
*NL*
and
here
he
remains
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
told
you
already
,
that
I
will
not
go
away
until
I
have
got
what
*NL*
I
ask
.
Why
are
you
smiling
,
prince
?
You
look
as
if
you
disapproved
of
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
smiling
,
but
I
really
think
you
are
in
the
wrong
,
somewhat
,
''
*NL*
replied
Muishkin
,
reluctantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
shuffle
!
Say
plainly
that
you
think
that
I
am
quite
wrong
,
*NL*
without
any
`
somewhat
'
!
Why
`
somewhat
'
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
say
you
are
quite
wrong
,
if
you
wish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
wish
!
That
's
good
,
I
must
say
!
Do
you
think
I
am
deceived
as
to
*NL*
the
flagrant
impropriety
of
my
conduct
?
I
am
quite
aware
that
his
money
*NL*
is
his
own
,
and
that
my
action
--
As
much
like
an
attempt
at
extortion
.
*NL*
But
you-you
do
n't
know
what
life
is
!
If
people
do
n't
learn
by
*NL*
experience
,
they
never
understand
.
They
must
be
taught
.
My
intentions
*NL*
are
perfectly
honest
;
on
my
conscience
he
will
lose
nothing
,
and
I
will
*NL*
pay
back
the
money
with
interest
.
Added
to
which
he
has
had
the
moral
*NL*
satisfaction
of
seeing
me
disgraced
.
What
does
he
want
more
?
and
what
*NL*
is
he
good
for
if
he
never
helps
anyone
?
Look
what
he
does
himself
!
just
*NL*
ask
him
about
his
dealings
with
others
,
how
he
deceives
people
!
How
did
*NL*
he
manage
to
buy
this
house
?
You
may
cut
off
my
head
if
he
has
not
let
*NL*
you
in
for
something
--
and
if
he
is
not
trying
to
cheat
you
again
.
You
are
*NL*
smiling
.
You
do
n't
believe
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
to
me
that
all
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
your
affairs
,
''
*NL*
remarked
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
lain
here
now
for
three
days
,
''
cried
the
young
man
without
*NL*
noticing
,
``
and
I
have
seen
a
lot
!
Fancy
!
he
suspects
his
daughter
,
that
*NL*
angel
,
that
orphan
,
my
cousin
--
he
suspects
her
,
and
every
evening
he
*NL*
searches
her
room
,
to
see
if
she
has
a
lover
hidden
in
it
!
He
comes
*NL*
here
too
on
tiptoe
,
creeping
softly
--
oh
,
so
softly
--
and
looks
under
the
*NL*
sofa
--
my
bed
,
you
know
.
He
is
mad
with
suspicion
,
and
sees
a
thief
in
*NL*
every
corner
.
He
runs
about
all
night
long
;
he
was
up
at
least
seven
*NL*
times
last
night
,
to
satisfy
himself
that
the
windows
and
doors
were
*NL*
barred
,
and
to
peep
into
the
oven
.
That
man
who
appears
in
court
for
*NL*
scoundrels
,
rushes
in
here
in
the
night
and
prays
,
lying
prostrate
,
*NL*
banging
his
head
on
the
ground
by
the
half-hour
--
and
for
whom
do
you
*NL*
think
he
prays
?
Who
are
the
sinners
figuring
in
his
drunken
petitions
?
*NL*
I
have
heard
him
with
my
own
ears
praying
for
the
repose
of
the
soul
*NL*
of
the
Countess
du
Barry
!
Colia
heard
it
too
.
He
is
as
mad
as
a
March
*NL*
hare
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
hear
how
he
slanders
me
,
prince
,
''
said
Lebedeff
,
almost
beside
*NL*
himself
with
rage
.
``
I
may
be
a
drunkard
,
an
evil-doer
,
a
thief
,
but
at
*NL*
least
I
can
say
one
thing
for
myself
.
He
does
not
know
--
how
should
he
,
*NL*
mocker
that
he
is
?
--
that
when
he
came
into
the
world
it
was
I
who
washed
*NL*
him
,
and
dressed
him
in
his
swathing-bands
,
for
my
sister
Anisia
had
*NL*
lost
her
husband
,
and
was
in
great
poverty
.
I
was
very
little
better
*NL*
off
than
she
,
but
I
sat
up
night
after
night
with
her
,
and
nursed
both
*NL*
mother
and
child
;
I
used
to
go
downstairs
and
steal
wood
for
them
from
*NL*
the
house-porter
.
How
often
did
I
sing
him
to
sleep
when
I
was
half
dead
*NL*
with
hunger
!
In
short
,
I
was
more
than
a
father
to
him
,
and
now
--
now
he
*NL*
jeers
at
me
!
Even
if
I
did
cross
myself
,
and
pray
for
the
repose
of
the
*NL*
soul
of
the
Comtesse
du
Barry
,
what
does
it
matter
?
Three
days
ago
,
*NL*
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
,
I
read
her
biography
in
an
historical
*NL*
dictionary
.
Do
you
know
who
she
was
?
You
there
!
''
addressing
his
nephew
.
*NL*
``
Speak
!
do
you
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
no
one
knows
anything
about
her
but
you
,
''
muttered
the
young
*NL*
man
in
a
would-be
jeering
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
was
a
Countess
who
rose
from
shame
to
reign
like
a
Queen
.
An
*NL*
Empress
wrote
to
her
,
with
her
own
hand
,
as
'
_
Ma
chere
cousine
_
.
'
At
*NL*
a
_
lever-du-roi
_
one
morning
-LRB-
do
you
know
what
a
_
lever-du-roi
_
was
?
-RRB-
--
a
*NL*
Cardinal
,
a
Papal
legate
,
offered
to
put
on
her
stockings
;
a
high
and
*NL*
holy
person
like
that
looked
on
it
as
an
honour
!
Did
you
know
this
?
I
*NL*
see
by
your
expression
that
you
did
not
!
Well
,
how
did
she
die
?
Answer
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
do
stop
--
you
are
too
absurd
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
how
she
died
.
After
all
this
honour
and
glory
,
after
having
*NL*
been
almost
a
Queen
,
she
was
guillotined
by
that
butcher
,
Samson
.
She
*NL*
was
quite
innocent
,
but
it
had
to
be
done
,
for
the
satisfaction
of
the
*NL*
fishwives
of
Paris
.
She
was
so
terrified
,
that
she
did
not
understand
*NL*
what
was
happening
.
But
when
Samson
seized
her
head
,
and
pushed
her
*NL*
under
the
knife
with
his
foot
,
she
cried
out
:
`
Wait
a
moment
!
wait
a
*NL*
moment
,
monsieur
!
'
Well
,
because
of
that
moment
of
bitter
suffering
,
*NL*
perhaps
the
Saviour
will
pardon
her
other
faults
,
for
one
can
not
imagine
*NL*
a
greater
agony
.
As
I
read
the
story
my
heart
bled
for
her
.
And
what
*NL*
does
it
matter
to
you
,
little
worm
,
if
I
implored
the
Divine
mercy
for
*NL*
her
,
great
sinner
as
she
was
,
as
I
said
my
evening
prayer
?
I
might
have
*NL*
done
it
because
I
doubted
if
anyone
had
ever
crossed
himself
for
her
*NL*
sake
before
.
It
may
be
that
in
the
other
world
she
will
rejoice
to
think
*NL*
that
a
sinner
like
herself
has
cried
to
heaven
for
the
salvation
of
her
*NL*
soul
.
Why
are
you
laughing
?
You
believe
nothing
,
atheist
!
And
your
story
*NL*
was
not
even
correct
!
If
you
had
listened
to
what
I
was
saying
,
you
*NL*
would
have
heard
that
I
did
not
only
pray
for
the
Comtesse
du
Barry
.
I
*NL*
said
,
`
Oh
Lord
!
give
rest
to
the
soul
of
that
great
sinner
,
the
Comtesse
*NL*
du
Barry
,
and
to
all
unhappy
ones
like
her
.
'
You
see
that
is
quite
a
*NL*
different
thing
,
for
how
many
sinners
there
are
,
how
many
women
,
who
*NL*
have
passed
through
the
trials
of
this
life
,
are
now
suffering
and
*NL*
groaning
in
purgatory
!
I
prayed
for
you
,
too
,
in
spite
of
your
insolence
*NL*
and
impudence
,
also
for
your
fellows
,
as
it
seems
that
you
claim
to
know
*NL*
how
I
pray
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
that
's
enough
in
all
conscience
!
Pray
for
whom
you
choose

and
the
*NL*
devil
take
them
and
you
!
We
have
a
scholar
here
;
you
did
not
know
that
,
*NL*
prince

he
continued
,
with
a
sneer
.
``
He
reads
all
sorts
of
books
and
*NL*
memoirs
now

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
any

a
kind

remarked
the
prince

who
*NL*
really
had
to
force
himself
to
speak
to
the
nephew
,
so
much
did
he
*NL*
dislike
him

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

are
going

up

puts
his

on
his
heart

he
is
delighted

I
never
said

was
a
man
*NL*
without
heart
,
but
he
is
a
rascal
--
that
's
the
pity
of
it
.
And
then
,
he
*NL*
is
addicted
to
drink
,
and
his
mind
is
unhinged
,
like
that
of
most
*NL*
people
who
have
taken
more
than
is
good
for
them
for
years
.
He
loves
his
*NL*
children
--
oh
,
I
know
that
well
enough
!
He
respected
my
aunt
,
his
late
*NL*
wife
...
and
he
even
has
a
sort
of
affection
for
me
.
He
has
remembered
me
*NL*
in
his
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
leave
you
nothing
!
''
exclaimed
his
uncle
angrily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
to
me
,
Lebedeff
,
''
said
the
prince
in
a
decided
voice
,
turning
*NL*
his
back
on
the
young
man
.
``
I
know
by
experience
that
when
you
choose
,
*NL*
you
can
be
business-like
.
.
I.
I
have
very
little
time
to
spare
,
and
*NL*
if
you
...
By
the
way
--
excuse
me
--
what
is
your
Christian
name
?
I
have
*NL*
forgotten
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ti-Ti-Timofey

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lukianovitch

''
*NL*
*NL*
Everyone
in
the
room
began
to
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
telling
lies
!
''
cried
the
nephew
.
``
Even
now
he
can
not
speak
*NL*
the
truth
.
He
is
not
called
Timofey
Lukianovitch

but
Lukian
*NL*
Timofeyovitch
.
Now
do
tell
us
why
you
must
needs
lie
about
it
?
Lukian
or
*NL*
Timofey
,
it
is
all
the
same
to
you
,
and
what
difference
can
it
make
to
*NL*
the
prince
?
He
tells
lies
without
the
least
necessity
,
simply
by
force
*NL*
of
habit
,
I
assure
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
true
?
''
said
the
prince
impatiently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
name
really
is
Lukian
Timofeyovitch

''
acknowledged
Lebedeff
,
*NL*
lowering
his
eyes
,
and
putting
his
hand
on
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
for
God
's
sake
,
what
made
you
say
the
other
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
humble
myself
,
''
murmured
Lebedeff
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
on
earth
do
you
mean
?
Oh
I
if
only
I
knew
where
Colia
was
at
this
*NL*
moment
!
''
cried
the
prince
,
standing
up
,
as
if
to
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
tell
you
all
about
Colia
,
''
said
the
young
man
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
no
,
no
!
''
said
Lebedeff
,
hurriedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Colia
spent
the
night
here
,
and
this
morning
went
after
his
father
,
*NL*
whom
you
let
out
of
prison
by
paying
his
debts
--
Heaven
only
knows
why
!
*NL*
Yesterday
the
general
promised
to
come
and
lodge
here
,
but
he
did
not
*NL*
appear
.
Most
probably
he
slept
at
the
hotel
close
by
.
No
doubt
Colia
*NL*
is
there
,
unless
he
has
gone
to
Pavlofsk
to
see
the
Epanchins
.
He
had
a
*NL*
little
money
,
and
was
intending
to
go
there
yesterday
.
He
must
be
either
*NL*
at
the
hotel
or
at
Pavlofsk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
Pavlofsk
!
He
is
at
Pavlofsk
,
undoubtedly
!
''
interrupted
Lebedeff
...
*NL*
``
But
come
--
let
us
go
into
the
garden
--
we
will
have
coffee
there
...
''
And
*NL*
Lebedeff
seized
the
prince
's
arm
,
and
led
him
from
the
room
.
They
went
*NL*
across
the
yard
,
and
found
themselves
in
a
delightful
little
garden
*NL*
with
the
trees
already
in
their
summer
dress
of
green
,
thanks
to
the
*NL*
unusually
fine
weather
.
Lebedeff
invited
his
guest
to
sit
down
on
a
*NL*
green
seat
before
a
table
of
the
same
colour
fixed
in
the
earth
,
and
*NL*
took
a
seat
facing
him
.
In
a
few
minutes
the
coffee
appeared
,
and
the
*NL*
prince
did
not
refuse
it
.
The
host
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
Muishkin
,
with
*NL*
an
expression
of
passionate
servility
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
nothing
about
your
home
before
,
''
said
the
prince
absently
,
as
if
*NL*
he
were
thinking
of
something
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
orphans
,
''
began
Lebedeff
,
his
face
assuming
a
mournful
air
,
but
he
*NL*
stopped
short
,
for
the
other
looked
at
him
inattentively
,
as
if
he
had
*NL*
already
forgotten
his
own
remark
.
They
waited
a
few
minutes
in
silence
,
*NL*
while
Lebedeff
sat
with
his
eyes
fixed
mournfully
on
the
young
man
's
*NL*
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
said
the
latter
,
at
last
rousing
himself
.
``
Ah
!
yes
!
You
know
why
*NL*
I
came
,
Lebedeff
.
Your
letter
brought
me
.
Speak
!
Tell
me
all
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
clerk
,
rather
confused
,
tried
to
say
something
,
hesitated
,
began
to
*NL*
speak
,
and
again
stopped
.
The
prince
looked
at
him
gravely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
understand
,
Lukian
Timofeyovitch
:
you
were
not
sure
that
I
*NL*
should
come
.
You
did
not
think
I
should
start
at
the
first
word
from
*NL*
you
,
and
you
merely
wrote
to
relieve
your
conscience
.
However
,
you
*NL*
see
now
that
I
have
come
,
and
I
have
had
enough
of
trickery
.
Give
up
*NL*
serving
,
or
trying
to
serve
,
two
masters

Rogojin
has
been
here
these
*NL*
three
weeks
.
Have
you
managed
to
sell
her
to
him
as
you
did
before
?
Tell
*NL*
me
the
truth

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
discovered
everything
,
the
monster
...
himself
...
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
abuse
him
;
though
I
dare
say
you
have
something
to
complain
*NL*
of
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
beat
me
,
he
thrashed
me
unmercifully
!

replied
Lebedeff
vehemently
.
*NL*
``
He
set
a
dog
on
me
in
Moscow
,
a
bloodhound
,
a
terrible
beast
that
*NL*
chased
me
all
down
the
street
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
seem
to
take
me
for
a
child

Lebedeff
.
Tell
me
,
is
it
a
fact
that
*NL*
she
left
him
while
they
were
in
Moscow
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
is
a
fact
,
and
this
time
,
let
me
tell
you
,
on
the
very
eve
of
*NL*
their
marriage
!
It
was
a
question
of
minutes
when
she
slipped
off
to
*NL*
Petersburg
.
She
came
to
me
directly
she
arrived
--
`
Save
me
,
Lukian
!
find
*NL*
me
some
refuge
,
and
say
nothing
to
the
prince
!
'
She
is
afraid
of
you
,
*NL*
even
more
than
she
is
of
him
,
and
in
that
she
shows
her
wisdom
!
''
And
*NL*
Lebedeff
slily
put
his
finger
to
his
brow
as
he
said
the
last
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
it
is
you
who
have
brought
them
together
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excellency

how
could
I
,
how
could
I
prevent
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
do

I
can
find
out
for
myself

Only
tell
me

where
is
she
*NL*
now
?
At
his
house

With
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no

Certainly
not

I
am
free

she
says
;
you
know
how
she
insists
*NL*
on
that
point
.
'
I
am
entirely
free
.
'
She
repeats
it
over
and
over
again
.
*NL*
She
is
living
in
Petersburgskaia
,
with
my
sister-in-law
,
as
I
told
you
*NL*
in
my
letter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
there
at
this
moment
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
unless
she
has
gone
to
Pavlofsk
:
the
fine
weather
may
have
tempted
*NL*
her

perhaps
,
into
the
country
,
with
Daria
Alexeyevna
.
'
I
am
quite
*NL*
free

'
she
says
.
Only
yesterday
she
boasted
of
her
freedom
to
Nicolai
*NL*
Ardalionovitch
--
a
bad
sign

''
added
Lebedeff
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Colia
goes
to
see
her
often
,
does
he
not

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He

it
long

there
yesterday

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
pity
you
have
taken
too
much
wine

Lebedeff
I
want
to
ask
you
*NL*
something

but
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
!
all
right
!
I
am
not
drunk

''
replied
the
clerk
,
preparing
to
*NL*
listen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
,
how
was
she
when
you
left
her

*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
a
woman

is
seeking

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Seeking

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
seems
always
to
be
searching
about
,
as
if
she
had
lost
something

*NL*
The
mere
idea
of
her
coming
marriage
disgusts
her
;
she
looks
on
it
as
*NL*
an
insult
.
She
cares
as
much
for
_
him
_
as
for
a
piece
of
orange-peel

not
*NL*
more
.
Yet
I
am
much
mistaken
if
she
does
not
look
on
him
with
fear
and
*NL*
trembling
.
She
forbids
his
name
to
be
mentioned
before
her
,
and
they
*NL*
only
meet
when
unavoidable
.
He
understands
,
well
enough
!
But
it
must
be
*NL*
gone
through
.
She
is
restless
,
mocking
,
deceitful
,
violent
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Deceitful
and
violent
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
violent
.
I
can
give
you
a
proof
of
it
.
A
few
days
ago
she
tried
*NL*
to
pull
my
hair
because
I
said
something
that
annoyed
her
.
I
tried
to
*NL*
soothe
her
by
reading
the
Apocalypse
aloud
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
exclaimed
the
prince
,
thinking
he
had
not
heard
aright
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
reading
the
Apocalypse
.
The
lady
has
a
restless
imagination
,
he-he
!
*NL*
She
has
a
liking
for
conversation
on
serious
subjects
,
of
any
kind
;
in
*NL*
fact
they
please
her
so
much
,
that
it
flatters
her
to
discuss
them
.
Now
*NL*
for
fifteen
years
at
least
I
have
studied
the
Apocalypse
,
and
she
agrees
*NL*
with
me
in
thinking
that
the
present
is
the
epoch
represented
by
the
*NL*
third
horse
,
the
black
one
whose
rider
holds
a
measure
in
his
hand
.
It
*NL*
seems
to
me
that
everything
is
ruled
by
measure
in
our
century
;
all
men
*NL*
are
clamouring
for
their
rights
;
'
a
measure
of
wheat
for
a
penny
,
and
*NL*
three
measures
of
barley
for
a
penny
.
'
But
,
added
to
this
,
men
desire
*NL*
freedom
of
mind
and
body
,
a
pure
heart
,
a
healthy
life
,
and
all
God
's
*NL*
good
gifts
.
Now
by
pleading
their
rights
alone
,
they
will
never
attain
*NL*
all
this
,
so
the
white
horse
,
with
his
rider
Death
,
comes
next
,
and
*NL*
is
followed
by
Hell
.
We
talked
about
this
matter
when
we
met
,
and
it
*NL*
impressed
her
very
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
believe
all
this
?
''
asked
Muishkin
,
looking
curiously
at
his
*NL*
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
both
believe
it
and
explain
it
.
I
am
but
a
poor
creature
,
a
beggar
,
*NL*
an
atom
in
the
scale
of
humanity
.
Who
has
the
least
respect
for
*NL*
Lebedeff
?
He
is
a
target
for
all
the
world
,
the
butt
of
any
fool
who
*NL*
chooses
to
kick
him
.
But
in
interpreting
revelation
I
am
the
equal
*NL*
of
anyone
,
great
as
he
may
be
!
Such
is
the
power
of
the
mind
and
*NL*
the
spirit
.
I
have
made
a
lordly
personage
tremble
,
as
he
sat
in
his
*NL*
armchair
...
only
by
talking
to
him
of
things
concerning
the
spirit
.
*NL*
Two
years
ago
,
on
Easter
Eve
,
His
Excellency
Nil
Alexeyovitch
,
whose
*NL*
subordinate
I
was
then
,
wished
to
hear
what
I
had
to
say
,
and
sent
a
*NL*
message
by
Peter
Zakkaritch
to
ask
me
to
go
to
his
private
room
.
`
They
*NL*
tell
me
you
expound
the
prophecies
relating
to
Antichrist
,
'
said
he
,
*NL*
when
we
were
alone
.
`
Is
that
so
?
'
`
Yes
,
'
I
answered
unhesitatingly
,
and
*NL*
I
began
to
give
some
comments
on
the
Apostle
's
allegorical
vision
.
At
*NL*
first
he
smiled
,
but
when
we
reached
the
numerical
computations
and
*NL*
correspondences
,
he
trembled
,
and
turned
pale
.
Then
he
begged
me
to
*NL*
close
the
book
,
and
sent
me
away
,
promising
to
put
my
name
on
the
reward
*NL*
list
.
That
took
place
as
I
said
on
the
eve
of
Easter
,
and
eight
days
*NL*
later
his
soul
returned
to
God
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
the
truth

One
evening
after
dinner
he
stumbled
as
he
stepped
*NL*
out
of
his
carriage
.
He
fell
,
and
struck
his
head
on
the
curb
,
and
died
*NL*
immediately
.
He
was
seventy-three
years
of
age
,
and
had
a
red
face
,
and
*NL*
white
hair
;
he
deluged
himself
with
scent
,
and
was
always
smiling
like
*NL*
a
child
.
Peter
Zakkaritch
recalled
my
interview
with
him
,
and
said
,
'
_
you
*NL*
foretold
his
death
.

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
rose
from
his
seat
,
and
Lebedeff
,
surprised
to
see
his
*NL*
guest
preparing
to
go
so
soon
,
remarked
:
``
You
are
not
interested

''
in
a
*NL*
respectful
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
very
well

my

Doubtless
the
effect

the
*NL*
journey

replied
the
prince
,
frowning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
go
into
the
country

said
Lebedeff
timidly

*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
seemed
to
be
considering
the
suggestion

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see

I
am
going

little
one
is
delicate
;
she
needs
change
*NL*
of
air
;
and
during
our
absence
this
house
will
be
done
up
.
I
am
going
to
*NL*
Pavlofsk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
going
to
Pavlofsk
too
?
''
asked
the
prince
sharply
.
``
Everybody
*NL*
seems
to
be
going
there
.
Have
you
a
house
in
that
neighbourhood
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
of
many
people
going
to
Pavlofsk
,
and
as
for
the
house
,
*NL*
Ivan
Ptitsin
has
let
me
one
of
his
villas
rather
cheaply
.
It
is
a
*NL*
pleasant
place
,
lying
on
a
hill
surrounded
by
trees
,
and
one
can
live
*NL*
there
for
a
mere
song
.
There
is
good
music
to
be
heard
,
so
no
wonder
it
*NL*
is
popular
.
I
shall
stay
in
the
lodge
.
As
to
the
villa
itself
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
let
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
N-no
--
not
exactly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
it
to
me
,
''
said
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
this
was
precisely
what
Lebedeff
had
made
up
his
mind
to
do
in
the
*NL*
last
three
minutes
.
Not
that
he
had
any
difficulty
in
finding
a
tenant
;
*NL*
in
fact
the
house
was
occupied
at
present
by
a
chance
visitor
,
who
had
*NL*
told
Lebedeff
that
he
would
perhaps
take
it
for
the
summer
months
.
The
*NL*
clerk
knew
very
well
that
this
''
_
perhaps
_
''
meant
''
_
certainly
_
,
''
but
as
he
*NL*
thought
he
could
make
more
out
of
a
tenant
like
the
prince
,
he
felt
*NL*
justified
in
speaking
vaguely
about
the
present
inhabitant
's
intentions
.
*NL*
``
This
is
quite
a
coincidence
,
''
thought
he
,
and
when
the
subject
of
price
*NL*
was
mentioned
,
he
made
a
gesture
with
his
hand
,
as
if
to
waive
away
a
*NL*
question
of
so
little
importance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
well
,
as
you
like
!
''
said
Muishkin
.
``
I
will
think
it
over
.
You
shall
*NL*
lose
nothing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
walking
slowly
across
the
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
you
...
I
could
...
''
stammered
Lebedeff
,
``
if
...
if
you
please
,
*NL*
prince
,
tell
you
something
on
the
subject
which
would
interest
you
,
I
am
*NL*
sure
.
''
He
spoke
in
wheedling
tones
,
and
wriggled
as
he
walked
along
.
*NL*
*NL*
Muishkin
stopped
short
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Daria
Alexeyevna
also
has
a
villa
at
Pavlofsk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
certain
person
is
very
friendly
with
her
,
and
intends
to
visit
her
*NL*
pretty
often
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aglaya
Ivanovna
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
stop
,
Lebedeff
!
''
interposed
Muishkin
,
feeling
as
if
he
had
been
*NL*
touched
on
an
open
wound
.
``
That
...
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
me
.
I
*NL*
should
like
to
know
when
you
are
going
to
start
.
The
sooner
the
better
*NL*
as
far
as
I
am
concerned
,
for
I
am
at
an
hotel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
left
the
garden
now
,
and
were
crossing
the
yard
on
their
way
to
*NL*
the
gate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
leave
your
hotel
at
once
and
come
here
;
then
we
can
all
go
*NL*
together
to
Pavlofsk
the
day
after
tomorrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
think
about
it
,
''
said
the
prince
dreamily
,
and
went
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
clerk
stood
looking
after
his
guest
,
struck
by
his
sudden
*NL*
absent-mindedness
.
He
had
not
even
remembered
to
say
goodbye
,
and
*NL*
Lebedeff
was
the
more
surprised
at
the
omission
,
as
he
knew
by
*NL*
experience
how
courteous
the
prince
usually
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
III
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
now
close
on
twelve
o'clock
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
knew
that
if
he
called
at
the
Epanchins
'
now
he
would
only
*NL*
find
the
general
,
and
that
the
latter
might
probably
carry
him
straight
*NL*
off
to
Pavlofsk
with
him
;
whereas
there
was
one
visit
he
was
most
*NL*
anxious
to
make
without
delay
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
at
the
risk
of
missing
General
Epanchin
altogether
,
and
thus
*NL*
postponing
his
visit
to
Pavlofsk
for
a
day
,
at
least
,
the
prince
decided
*NL*
to
go
and
look
for
the
house
he
desired
to
find
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
visit
he
was
about
to
pay
was
,
in
some
respects
,
a
risky
one
.
He
was
*NL*
in
two
minds
about
it
,
but
knowing
that
the
house
was
in
the
Gorohovaya
,
*NL*
not
far
from
the
Sadovaya
,
he
determined
to
go
in
that
direction
,
and
to
*NL*
try
to
make
up
his
mind
on
the
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arrived
at
the
point
where
the
Gorohovaya
crosses
the
Sadovaya
,
he
was
*NL*
surprised
to
find
how
excessively
agitated
he
was
.
He
had
no
idea
that
*NL*
his
heart
could
beat
so
painfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
house
in
the
Gorohovaya
began
to
attract
his
attention
long
before
*NL*
he
reached
it
,
and
the
prince
remembered
afterwards
that
he
had
said
*NL*
to
himself
:
``
That
is
the
house
,
I
'm
sure
of
it
.
''
He
came
up
to
it
quite
*NL*
curious
to
discover
whether
he
had
guessed
right
,
and
felt
that
he
would
*NL*
be
disagreeably
impressed
to
find
that
he
had
actually
done
so
.
The
*NL*
house
was
a
large
gloomy-looking
structure
,
without
the
slightest
claim
*NL*
to
architectural
beauty
,
in
colour
a
dirty
green
.
There
are
a
few
of
*NL*
these
old
houses
,
built
towards
the
end
of
the
last
century
,
still
*NL*
standing
in
that
part
of
St.
Petersburg
,
and
showing
little
change
*NL*
from
their
original
form
and
colour
.
They
are
solidly
built
,
and
are
*NL*
remarkable
for
the
thickness
of
their
walls
,
and
for
the
fewness
*NL*
of
their
windows
,
many
of
which
are
covered
by
gratings
.
On
the
*NL*
ground-floor
there
is
usually
a
money-changer
's
shop
,
and
the
owner
*NL*
lives
over
it
.
Without
as
well
as
within
,
the
houses
seem
inhospitable
*NL*
and
mysterious
--
an
impression
which
is
difficult
to
explain
,
unless
it
*NL*
has
something
to
do
with
the
actual
architectural
style
.
These
houses
*NL*
are
almost
exclusively
inhabited
by
the
merchant
class
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arrived
at
the
gate
,
the
prince
looked
up
at
the
legend
over
it
,
which
*NL*
ran
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
House
of
Rogojin
,
hereditary
and
honourable
citizen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
hesitated
no
longer
;
but
opened
the
glazed
door
at
the
bottom
of
the
*NL*
outer
stairs
and
made
his
way
up
to
the
second
storey
.
The
place
was
*NL*
dark
and
gloomy-looking
;
the
walls
of
the
stone
staircase
were
painted
*NL*
a
dull
red
.
Rogojin
and
his
mother
and
brother
occupied
the
whole
of
*NL*
the
second
floor
.
The
servant
who
opened
the
door
to
Muishkin
led
him
,
*NL*
without
taking
his
name
,
through
several
rooms
and
up
and
down
many
*NL*
steps
until
they
arrived
at
a
door
,
where
he
knocked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Parfen
Rogojin
opened
the
door
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
seeing
the
prince
he
became
deadly
white
,
and
apparently
fixed
to
the
*NL*
ground
,
so
that
he
was
more
like
a
marble
statue
than
a
human
being
.
The
*NL*
prince
had
expected
some
surprise
,
but
Rogojin
evidently
considered
his
*NL*
visit
an
impossible
and
miraculous
event
.
He
stared
with
an
expression
*NL*
almost
of
terror
,
and
his
lips
twisted
into
a
bewildered
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Parfen
!
perhaps
my
visit
is
ill-timed
.
I
--
I
can
go
away
again
if
you
*NL*
like
,
''
said
Muishkin
at
last
,
rather
embarrassed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
;
it
's
all
right
,
come
in
,
''
said
Parfen
,
recollecting
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
evidently
on
quite
familiar
terms
.
In
Moscow
they
had
had
many
*NL*
occasions
of
meeting
;
indeed
,
some
few
of
those
meetings
were
but
too
*NL*
vividly
impressed
upon
their
memories
.
They
had
not
met
now
,
however
,
*NL*
for
three
months
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
deathlike
pallor
,
and
a
sort
of
slight
convulsion
about
the
lips
,
*NL*
had
not
left
Rogojin
's
face
.
Though
he
welcomed
his
guest
,
he
was
still
*NL*
obviously
much
disturbed
.
As
he
invited
the
prince
to
sit
down
near
the
*NL*
table
,
the
latter
happened
to
turn
towards
him
,
and
was
startled
by
the
*NL*
strange
expression
on
his
face
.
A
painful
recollection
flashed
into
*NL*
his
mind
.
He
stood
for
a
time
,
looking
straight
at
Rogojin
,
whose
eyes
*NL*
seemed
to
blaze
like
fire
.
At
last
Rogojin
smiled
,
though
he
still
*NL*
looked
agitated
and
shaken
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
staring
at
me
like
that
for
?
''
he
muttered
.
``
Sit
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
took
a
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Parfen
,
''
he
said
,
``
tell
me
honestly
,
did
you
know
that
I
was
coming
to
*NL*
Petersburg
or
no
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
supposed
you
were
coming
,
''
the
other
replied
,
smiling
*NL*
sarcastically
,
``
and
I
was
right
in
my
supposition
,
you
see
;
but
how
was
I
*NL*
to
know
that
you
would
come
_
today
?
_
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
certain
strangeness
and
impatience
in
his
manner
impressed
the
prince
*NL*
very
forcibly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
if
you
had
known
that
I
was
coming
today
,
why
be
so
irritated
about
*NL*
it
?
''
he
asked
,
in
quiet
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
you
ask
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
when
I
jumped
out
of
the
train
this
morning
,
two
eyes
glared
at
*NL*
me
just
as
yours
did
a
moment
since
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
!
and
whose
eyes
may
they
have
been
?
''
said
Rogojin
,
suspiciously
.
It
*NL*
seemed
to
the
prince
that
he
was
trembling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
;
I
thought
it
was
a
hallucination
.
I
often
have
*NL*
hallucinations
nowadays
.
I
feel
just
as
I
did
five
years
ago
when
my
*NL*
fits
were
about
to
come
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
perhaps
it
was
a
hallucination
,
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
Parfen
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
tried
to
give
the
prince
an
affectionate
smile
,
and
it
seemed
to
the
*NL*
latter
as
though
in
this
smile
of
his
something
had
broken
,
and
that
he
*NL*
could
not
mend
it
,
try
as
he
would
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
you
go
abroad
again
then
?
''
he
asked
,
and
suddenly
added
,
``
Do
you
*NL*
remember
how
we
came
up
in
the
train
from
Pskoff
together
?
You
and
your
*NL*
cloak
and
leggings
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Rogojin
burst
out
laughing
,
this
time
with
unconcealed
malice
,
as
*NL*
though
he
were
glad
that
he
had
been
able
to
find
an
opportunity
for
*NL*
giving
vent
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
quite
taken
up
your
quarters
here
?
''
asked
the
prince
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
'm
at
home
.
Where
else
should
I
go
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
n't
met
for
some
time
.
Meanwhile
I
have
heard
things
about
you
*NL*
which
I
should
not
have
believed
to
be
possible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
of
that
?
People
will
say
anything
,
''
said
Rogojin
drily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
all
events
,
you
've
disbanded
your
troop
--
and
you
are
living
in
your
*NL*
own
house
instead
of
being
fast
and
loose
about
the
place
;
that
's
all
*NL*
very
good
.
Is
this
house
all
yours
,
or
joint
property
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
my
mother
's
.
You
get
to
her
apartments
by
that
passage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
's
your
brother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
other
wing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
married
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Widower
.
Why
do
you
want
to
know
all
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
looked
at
him
,
but
said
nothing
.
He
had
suddenly
relapsed
*NL*
into
musing
,
and
had
probably
not
heard
the
question
at
all
.
Rogojin
did
*NL*
not
insist
upon
an
answer
,
and
there
was
silence
for
a
few
moments
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
guessed
which
was
your
house
from
a
hundred
yards
off
,
''
said
the
*NL*
prince
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
quite
know
.
Your
house
has
the
aspect
of
yourself
and
all
your
*NL*
family
;
it
bears
the
stamp
of
the
Rogojin
life
;
but
ask
me
why
I
think
*NL*
so
,
and
I
can
tell
you
nothing
.
It
is
nonsense
,
of
course
.
I
am
nervous
*NL*
about
this
kind
of
thing
troubling
me
so
much
.
I
had
never
before
*NL*
imagined
what
sort
of
a
house
you
would
live
in
,
and
yet
no
sooner
did
I
*NL*
set
eyes
on
this
one
than
I
said
to
myself
that
it
must
be
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
!
''
said
Rogojin
vaguely
,
not
taking
in
what
the
prince
meant
by
*NL*
his
rather
obscure
remarks
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
room
they
were
now
sitting
in
was
a
large
one
,
lofty
but
dark
,
well
*NL*
furnished
,
principally
with
writing-tables
and
desks
covered
with
papers
*NL*
and
books
.
A
wide
sofa
covered
with
red
morocco
evidently
served
Rogojin
*NL*
for
a
bed
.
On
the
table
beside
which
the
prince
had
been
invited
to
seat
*NL*
himself
lay
some
books
;
one
containing
a
marker
where
the
reader
had
*NL*
left
off
,
was
a
volume
of
Solovieff
's
History
.
Some
oil-paintings
in
*NL*
worn
gilded
frames
hung
on
the
walls
,
but
it
was
impossible
to
make
out
*NL*
what
subjects
they
represented
,
so
blackened
were
they
by
smoke
and
age
.
*NL*
One
,
a
life-sized
portrait
,
attracted
the
prince
's
attention
.
It
showed
*NL*
a
man
of
about
fifty
,
wearing
a
long
riding-coat
of
German
cut
.
He
had
*NL*
two
medals
on
his
breast
;
his
beard
was
white
,
short
and
thin
;
his
face
*NL*
yellow
and
wrinkled
,
with
a
sly
,
suspicious
expression
in
the
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
your
father
,
is
it
not
?
''
asked
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
is
,
''
replied
Rogojin
with
an
unpleasant
smile
,
as
if
he
*NL*
had
expected
his
guest
to
ask
the
question
,
and
then
to
make
some
*NL*
disagreeable
remark
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
he
one
of
the
Old
Believers
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
he
went
to
church
,
but
to
tell
the
truth
he
really
preferred
the
*NL*
old
religion
.
This
was
his
study
and
is
now
mine
.
Why
did
you
ask
if
he
*NL*
were
an
Old
Believer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
going
to
be
married
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye-yes
!
''
replied
Rogojin
,
starting
at
the
unexpected
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Soon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
yourself
it
does
not
depend
on
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Parfen
,
I
am
not
your
enemy
,
and
I
do
not
intend
to
oppose
your
*NL*
intentions
in
any
way
.
I
repeat
this
to
you
now
just
as
I
said
it
to
you
*NL*
once
before
on
a
very
similar
occasion
.
When
you
were
arranging
for
your
*NL*
projected
marriage
in
Moscow
,
I
did
not
interfere
with
you
--
you
know
I
*NL*
did
not
.
That
first
time
she
fled
to
me
from
you
,
from
the
very
altar
*NL*
almost
,
and
begged
me
to
`
save
her
from
you
.
'
Afterwards
she
ran
away
*NL*
from
me
again
,
and
you
found
her
and
arranged
your
marriage
with
her
*NL*
once
more
;
and
now
,
I
hear
,
she
has
run
away
from
you
and
come
to
*NL*
Petersburg
.
Is
it
true
?
Lebedeff
wrote
me
to
this
effect
,
and
that
's
*NL*
why
I
came
here
.
That
you
had
once
more
arranged
matters
with
Nastasia
*NL*
Philipovna
I
only
learned
last
night
in
the
train
from
a
friend
of
*NL*
yours
,
Zaleshoff
--
if
you
wish
to
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
confess
I
came
here
with
an
object
.
I
wished
to
persuade
Nastasia
*NL*
to
go
abroad
for
her
health
;
she
requires
it
.
Both
mind
and
body
need
a
*NL*
change
badly
.
I
did
not
intend
to
take
her
abroad
myself
.
I
was
going
to
*NL*
arrange
for
her
to
go
without
me
.
Now
I
tell
you
honestly
,
Parfen
,
if
it
*NL*
is
true
that
all
is
made
up
between
you
,
I
will
not
so
much
as
set
eyes
*NL*
upon
her
,
and
I
will
never
even
come
to
see
you
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
quite
well
that
I
am
telling
the
truth
,
because
I
have
always
*NL*
been
frank
with
you
.
I
have
never
concealed
my
own
opinion
from
you
.
*NL*
I
have
always
told
you
that
I
consider
a
marriage
between
you
and
her
*NL*
would
be
ruin
to
her
.
You
would
also
be
ruined
,
and
perhaps
even
more
*NL*
hopelessly
.
If
this
marriage
were
to
be
broken
off
again
,
I
admit
I
*NL*
should
be
greatly
pleased
;
but
at
the
same
time
I
have
not
the
slightest
*NL*
intention
of
trying
to
part
you
.
You
may
be
quite
easy
in
your
mind
,
*NL*
and
you
need
not
suspect
me
.
You
know
yourself
whether
I
was
ever
really
*NL*
your
rival
or
not
,
even
when
she
ran
away
and
came
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
you
are
laughing
at
me
--
I
know
why
you
laugh
.
It
is
perfectly
*NL*
true
that
we
lived
apart
from
one
another
all
the
time
,
in
different
*NL*
towns
.
I
told
you
before
that
I
did
not
love
her
with
love
,
but
with
*NL*
pity
!
You
said
then
that
you
understood
me
;
did
you
really
understand
*NL*
me
or
not
?
What
hatred
there
is
in
your
eyes
at
this
moment
!
I
came
*NL*
to
relieve
your
mind
,
because
you
are
dear
to
me
also
.
I
love
you
*NL*
very
much
,
Parfen
;
and
now
I
shall
go
away
and
never
come
back
again
.
*NL*
Goodbye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
a
little
,
''
said
Parfen
,
not
leaving
his
chair
and
resting
his
head
*NL*
on
his
right
hand
.
``
I
have
n't
seen
you
for
a
long
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
sat
down
again
.
Both
were
silent
for
a
few
moments
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
you
are
not
with
me
I
hate
you
,
Lef
Nicolaievitch
.
I
have
loathed
*NL*
you
every
day
of
these
three
months
since
I
last
saw
you
.
By
heaven
I
*NL*
have
!
''
said
Rogojin
.
``
I
could
have
poisoned
you
at
any
minute
.
Now
,
you
*NL*
have
been
with
me
but
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
and
all
my
malice
seems
to
*NL*
have
melted
away
,
and
you
are
as
dear
to
me
as
ever
.
Stay
here
a
little
*NL*
longer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
am
with
you
you
trust
me
;
but
as
soon
as
my
back
is
turned
you
*NL*
suspect
me
,
''
said
the
prince
,
smiling
,
and
trying
to
hide
his
emotion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
trust
your
voice
,
when
I
hear
you
speak
.
I
quite
understand
that
you
*NL*
and
I
can
not
be
put
on
a
level
,
of
course
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
you
add
that
?
--
There
!
Now
you
are
cross
again
,
''
said
the
*NL*
prince
,
wondering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
were
not
asked
,
you
see
.
We
were
made
different
,
with
different
*NL*
tastes
and
feelings
,
without
being
consulted
.
You
say
you
love
her
with
*NL*
pity
.
I
have
no
pity
for
her
.
She
hates
me
--
that
's
the
plain
truth
of
*NL*
the
matter
.
I
dream
of
her
every
night
,
and
always
that
she
is
laughing
*NL*
at
me
with
another
man
.
And
so
she
does
laugh
at
me
.
She
thinks
no
more
*NL*
of
marrying
me
than
if
she
were
changing
her
shoe
.
Would
you
believe
it
,
*NL*
I
have
n't
seen
her
for
five
days
,
and
I
dare
n't
go
near
her
.
She
asks
me
*NL*
what
I
come
for
,
as
if
she
were
not
content
with
having
disgraced
me
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Disgraced
you
!
How
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
as
though
you
did
n't
know
!
Why
,
she
ran
away
from
me
,
and
went
to
*NL*
you
.
You
admitted
it
yourself
,
just
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
surely
you
do
not
believe
that
she
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
she
did
not
disgrace
me
at
Moscow
with
that
officer
.
Zemtuznikoff
?
*NL*
I
know
for
certain
she
did
,
after
having
fixed
our
marriage-day
*NL*
herself
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Impossible
!

cried
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it
for
a
fact

replied
Rogojin
,
with
conviction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
like
her
,
you
say
?
My
friend
,
that
's
absurd
.
Perhaps
such
an
*NL*
act
would
horrify
her
,
if
she
were
with
you
,
but
it
is
quite
different
*NL*
where
I
am
concerned
.
She
looks
on
me
as
vermin
.
Her
affair
with
Keller
*NL*
was
simply
to
make
a
laughing-stock
of
me
.
You
do
n't
know
what
a
fool
*NL*
she
made
of
me
in
Moscow
;
and
the
money
I
spent
over
her
!
The
money
!
the
*NL*
money
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
can
marry
her
now
,
Parfen
!
What
will
come
of
it
all
?
''
said
the
*NL*
prince
,
with
dread
in
his
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rogojin
gazed
back
gloomily
,
and
with
a
terrible
expression
in
his
eyes
,
*NL*
but
said
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
been
to
see
her
for
five
days
,
''
he
repeated
,
after
a
slight
*NL*
pause
.
``
I
'm
afraid
of
being
turned
out
.
She
says
she
's
still
her
own
*NL*
mistress
,
and
may
turn
me
off
altogether
,
and
go
abroad
.
She
told
me
*NL*
this
herself
,
''
he
said
,
with
a
peculiar
glance
at
Muishkin
.
``
I
think
she
*NL*
often
does
it
merely
to
frighten
me
.
She
is
always
laughing
at
me
,
for
*NL*
some
reason
or
other
;
but
at
other
times
she
's
angry
,
and
wo
n't
say
a
*NL*
word
,
and
that
's
what
I
'm
afraid
of
.
I
took
her
a
shawl
one
day
,
the
*NL*
like
of
which
she
might
never
have
seen
,
although
she
did
live
in
luxury
*NL*
and
she
gave
it
away
to
her
maid
,
Katia
.
Sometimes
when
I
can
keep
away
*NL*
no
longer
,
I
steal
past
the
house
on
the
sly
,
and
once
I
watched
at
the
*NL*
gate
till
dawn
--
I
thought
something
was
going
on
--
and
she
saw
me
from
*NL*
the
window
.
She
asked
me
what
I
should
do
if
I
found
she
had
deceived
*NL*
me
.
I
said
,
`
You
know
well
enough

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
she
know
?

cried
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
was
I
to
tell
?

replied
Rogojin
,
with
an
angry
laugh
.
``
I
did
my
*NL*
best
to
catch
her
tripping
in
Moscow
,
but
did
not
succeed
.
However
,
I
*NL*
caught
hold
of
her
one
day
,
and
said
:
`
You
are
engaged
to
be
married
*NL*
into
a
respectable
family
,
and
do
you
know
what
sort
of
a
woman
you
are
?
*NL*
_
That
's

the
sort
of
woman
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
told

*NL*

Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

go
on

She
said
,

I
would

even
have
you
for
a
footman
now

much
less

*NL*
a
husband

I
sha
n't
leave
the
house

I
said
,
`
so
it
does
n't
matter

*NL*
`
Then
I
shall
call
somebody
and
have
you
kicked
out
,
'
she
cried
.
So
then
*NL*
I
rushed
at
her
,
and
beat
her
till
she
was
bruised
all
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Impossible
!
''
cried
the
prince
,
aghast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
it
's
true

said
Rogojin
quietly
,
but
with
eyes
ablaze
with
*NL*
passion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
for
a
day
and
a
half
I
neither
slept
,
nor
ate
,
nor
drank
,
and
*NL*
would
not
leave
her
.
I
knelt
at
her
feet
:
'
I
shall
die
here
,
'
I
said
,
*NL*
`
if
you
do
n't
forgive
me
;
and
if
you
have
me
turned
out
,
I
shall
drown
*NL*
myself
;
because
,
what
should
I
be
without
you
now

'
She
was
like
a
*NL*
madwoman
all
that
day
;
now
she
would
cry
;
now
she
would
threaten
me
with
*NL*
a
knife
;
now
she
would
abuse
me

She
called
in
Zaleshoff
and
Keller
,
*NL*
and
showed
me
to
them
,
shamed
me
in
their
presence
.
`
Let

all
go
to
*NL*
the
theatre

she
says
,
`
and
leave
him
here
if
he
wo
n't
go

it
's
not
*NL*
my
business

They
'll
give
you
some
tea

Parfen
Semeonovitch
,
while
I
*NL*
am
away
,
for
you
must
be
hungry

'
She
came
back
from
the
theatre
alone
.
*NL*
`
Those
cowards
would
n't
come
,
'
she
said
.
`
They
are
afraid
of
you

*NL*
tried
to
frighten
me
,
too
.
``
He
wo
n't
go
away
as
he
came
,
''
they
said
,
*NL*
``
he
'll
cut
your
throat

see
if
he
does
n't

''
Now
,
I
shall
go
to
my
*NL*
bedroom
,
and
I
shall
not
even
lock
my
door
,
just
to
show
you
how
much
*NL*
I
am
afraid
of
you
.
You
must
be
shown
that
once
for
all

Did
you
have
*NL*
tea
?
'
`
No

I
said
,
`
and
I
do
n't
intend
to
.
'
`
Ha
,
ha
!
you
are
playing
*NL*
off
your
pride
against
your
stomach
!
That
sort
of
heroism
does
n't
sit
*NL*
well
on
you

she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
that
she
did
as
she
had
said
she
would

she
went
to
bed
,
and
did
*NL*
not
lock
her
door
.
In
the
morning
she
came
out
.
`
Are
you
quite
mad
?
'
she
*NL*
said
,
sharply
.
`
Why
,
you
'll
die
of
hunger
like
this
.
'
`
Forgive
me

*NL*
I
said
.
`
No
,
I
wo
n't
,
and
I
wo
n't
marry
you
.
I
've
said
it

Surely
you
*NL*
have
n't
sat
in
this
chair
all
night
without
sleeping
?
'
'
I
did
n't
*NL*
sleep
,
'
I
said
.
`
H
'm
!
how
sensible
of
you
.
And
are
you
going
to
have
no
*NL*
breakfast
or
dinner
today

I
told
you
I
would

Forgive
me

`
You
've
*NL*
no
idea
how
unbecoming
this
sort
of
thing
is
to
you

she
said
,
`
it
's
*NL*
like
putting
a
saddle
on
a
cow
's
back
.
Do
you
think
you
are
frightening
*NL*
me
?
My
word
,
what
a
dreadful
thing
that
you
should
sit
here
and
eat
no
*NL*
food
!
How
terribly
frightened
I
am
!
'
She
was
n't
angry
long
,
and
did
n't
*NL*
seem
to
remember
my
offence
at
all
.
I
was
surprised
,
for
she
is
a
*NL*
vindictive
,
resentful
woman
--
but
then
I
thought
that
perhaps
she
*NL*
despised
me
too
much
to
feel
any
resentment
against
me
.
And
that
's
the
*NL*
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
came
up
to
me
and
said
,
`
Do
you
know
who
the
Pope
of
Rome
is
?
'
*NL*
`
I
've
heard
of
him
,
'
I
said
.
'
I
suppose
you
've
read
the
Universal
*NL*
History
,
Parfen
Semeonovitch
,
have
n't
you
?
'
she
asked
.
`
I
've
learned
*NL*
nothing
at
all
,
'
I
said
.
`
Then
I
'll
lend
it
to
you
to
read
.
You
must
*NL*
know
there
was
a
Roman
Pope
once
,
and
he
was
very
angry
with
a
certain
*NL*
Emperor
;
so
the
Emperor
came
and
neither
ate
nor
drank
,
but
knelt
before
*NL*
the
Pope
's
palace
till
he
should
be
forgiven
.
And
what
sort
of
vows
do
*NL*
you
think
that
Emperor
was
making
during
all
those
days
on
his
knees
?
*NL*
Stop
,
I
'll
read
it
to
you
!
'
Then
she
read
me
a
lot
of
verses
,
where
it
*NL*
said
that
the
Emperor
spent
all
the
time
vowing
vengeance
against
the
*NL*
Pope
.
`
You
do
n't
mean
to
say
you
do
n't
approve
of
the
poem
,
Parfen
*NL*
Semeonovitch
,
'
she
says
.
`
All
you
have
read
out
is
perfectly
true
,
'
say
*NL*
I.
`
Aha
!
'
says
she
,
`
you
admit
it
's
true
,
do
you
?
And
you
are
making
*NL*
vows
to
yourself
that
if
I
marry
you
,
you
will
remind
me
of
all
this
,
*NL*
and
take
it
out
of
me
.
'
'
I
do
n't
know
,
'
I
say
,
`
perhaps
I
was
thinking
*NL*
like
that
,
and
perhaps
I
was
not
.
I
'm
not
thinking
of
anything
just
*NL*
now
.
'
`
What
are
your
thoughts
,
then
?
'
`
I
'm
thinking
that
when
you
rise
*NL*
from
your
chair
and
go
past
me
,
I
watch
you
,
and
follow
you
with
my
*NL*
eyes
;
if
your
dress
does
but
rustle
,
my
heart
sinks
;
if
you
leave
the
*NL*
room
,
I
remember
every
little
word
and
action
,
and
what
your
voice
*NL*
sounded
like
,
and
what
you
said
.
I
thought
of
nothing
all
last
night
,
*NL*
but
sat
here
listening
to
your
sleeping
breath
,
and
heard
you
move
a
*NL*
little
,
twice
.
'
`
And
as
for
your
attack
upon
me
,
'
she
says
,
'
I
suppose
*NL*
you
never
once
thought
of
_
that
?
_
'
`
Perhaps
I
did
think
of
it
,
and
perhaps
*NL*
not
,
'
I
say
.
And
what
if
I
do
n't
either
forgive
you
or
marry
,
you
'
*NL*
'
I
tell
you
I
shall
go
and
drown
myself
.
'
`
H
'm
!
'
she
said
,
and
then
*NL*
relapsed
into
silence
.
Then
she
got
angry
,
and
went
out
.
'
I
suppose
*NL*
you
'd
murder
me
before
you
drowned
yourself
,
though
!
'
she
cried
as
she
*NL*
left
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
hour
later
,
she
came
to
me
again
,
looking
melancholy
.
'
I
will
marry
*NL*
you
,
Parfen
Semeonovitch
,
'
she
says
,
not
because
I
'm
frightened
of
you
,
*NL*
but
because
it
's
all
the
same
to
me
how
I
ruin
myself
.
And
how
can
I
do
*NL*
it
better
?
Sit
down
;
they
'll
bring
you
some
dinner
directly
.
And
if
I
*NL*
do
marry
you
,
I
'll
be
a
faithful
wife
to
you
--
you
need
not
doubt
that
.
'
*NL*
Then
she
thought
a
bit
,
and
said
,
`
At
all
events
,
you
are
not
a
flunkey
;
*NL*
at
first
,
I
thought
you
were
no
better
than
a
flunkey
.
'
And
she
arranged
*NL*
the
wedding
and
fixed
the
day
straight
away
on
the
spot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
in
another
week
,
she
had
run
away
again
,
and
came
here
to
*NL*
Lebedeff
's
;
and
when
I
found
her
here
,
she
said
to
me
,
`
I
'm
not
going
to
*NL*
renounce
you
altogether
,
but
I
wish
to
put
off
the
wedding
a
bit
longer
*NL*
yet
--
just
as
long
as
I
like
--
for
I
am
still
my
own
mistress
;
so
you
may
*NL*
wait
,
if
you
like
.
'
That
's
how
the
matter
stands
between
us
now
.
What
do
*NL*
you
think
of
all
this
,
Lef
Nicolaievitch
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
What
do
you
think
of
it
yourself
?
''
replied
the
prince
,
looking
sadly
*NL*
at
Rogojin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
if
I
can
think
anything
about
it
!
I
--
''
He
was
about
to
say
more
,
but
*NL*
stopped
in
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
rose
again
,
as
if
he
would
leave
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
all
events
,
I
shall
not
interfere
with
you
!
''
he
murmured
,
as
though
*NL*
making
answer
to
some
secret
thought
of
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
what
!
''
cried
Rogojin
,
and
his
eyes
flashed
fire
.
``
I
ca
n't
*NL*
understand
your
yielding
her
to
me
like
this
;
I
do
n't
understand
it
.
*NL*
Have
you
given
up
loving
her
altogether
?
At
first
you
suffered
badly
--
I
*NL*
know
it
--
I
saw
it
.
Besides
,
why
did
you
come
post-haste
after
us
?
Out
of
*NL*
pity
,
eh
?
He
,
he
,
he
!
''
His
mouth
curved
in
a
mocking
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
I
am
deceiving
you
?
''
asked
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
I
trust
you
--
but
I
ca
n't
understand
.
It
seems
to
me
that
your
pity
*NL*
is
greater
than
my
love
.
''
A
hungry
longing
to
speak
his
mind
out
seemed
*NL*
to
flash
in
the
man
's
eyes
,
combined
with
an
intense
anger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
love
is
mingled
with
hatred
,
and
therefore
,
when
your
love
passes
,
*NL*
there
will
be
the
greater
misery
,
''
said
the
prince
.
``
I
tell
you
this
,
*NL*
Parfen
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
that
I
'll
cut
her
throat
,
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
shuddered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
hate
her
afterwards
for
all
your
present
love
,
and
for
all
the
*NL*
torment
you
are
suffering
on
her
account
now
.
What
seems
to
me
the
most
*NL*
extraordinary
thing
is
,
that
she
can
again
consent
to
marry
you
,
after
*NL*
all
that
has
passed
between
you
.
When
I
heard
the
news
yesterday
,
I
*NL*
could
hardly
bring
myself
to
believe
it
.
Why
,
she
has
run
twice
*NL*
from
you
,
from
the
very
altar
rails
,
as
it
were
.
She
must
have
some
*NL*
presentiment
of
evil
.
What
can
she
want
with
you
now
?
Your
money
?
*NL*
Nonsense
!
Besides
,
I
should
think
you
must
have
made
a
fairly
large
hole
*NL*
in
your
fortune
already
.
Surely
it
is
not
because
she
is
so
very
anxious
*NL*
to
find
a
husband
?
She
could
find
many
a
one
besides
yourself
.
Anyone
*NL*
would
be
better
than
you
,
because
you
will
murder
her
,
and
I
feel
sure
*NL*
she
must
know
that
but
too
well
by
now
.
Is
it
because
you
love
her
so
*NL*
passionately
?
Indeed
,
that
may
be
it
.
I
have
heard
that
there
are
women
*NL*
who
want
just
that
kind
of
love
...
but
still
...
''
The
prince
paused
,
*NL*
reflectively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
grinning
at
my
father
's
portrait
again
for
?
''
asked
*NL*
Rogojin
,
suddenly
.
He
was
carefully
observing
every
change
in
the
*NL*
expression
of
the
prince
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
smiled
because
the
idea
came
into
my
head
that
if
it
were
not
for
*NL*
this
unhappy
passion
of
yours
you
might
have
,
and
would
have
,
become
*NL*
just
such
a
man
as
your
father
,
and
that
very
quickly
,
too
.
You
'd
have
*NL*
settled
down
in
this
house
of
yours
with
some
silent
and
obedient
wife
.
*NL*
You
would
have
spoken
rarely
,
trusted
no
one
,
heeded
no
one
,
and
thought
*NL*
of
nothing
but
making
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Laugh
away
!
She
said
exactly
the
same
,
almost
word
for
word
,
when
she
*NL*
saw
my
father
's
portrait
.
It
's
remarkable
how
entirely
you
and
she
are
*NL*
at
one
now-a-days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
has
she
been
here
?
''
asked
the
prince
with
curiosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
!
She
looked
long
at
the
portrait
and
asked
all
about
my
father
.
*NL*
`
You
'd
be
just
such
another
,
'
she
said
at
last
,
and
laughed
.
`
You
have
*NL*
such
strong
passions
,
Parfen
,
'
she
said
,
`
that
they
'd
have
taken
you
to
*NL*
Siberia
in
no
time
if
you
had
not
,
luckily
,
intelligence
as
well
.
For
*NL*
you
have
a
good
deal
of
intelligence
.
'
-LRB-
She
said
this
--
believe
it
or
*NL*
not
.
The
first
time
I
ever
heard
anything
of
that
sort
from
her
.
-RRB-
`
You
'd
*NL*
soon
have
thrown
up
all
this
rowdyism
that
you
indulge
in
now
,
and
you
'd
*NL*
have
settled
down
to
quiet
,
steady
money-making
,
because
you
have
little
*NL*
education
;
and
here
you
'd
have
stayed
just
like
your
father
before
you
.
*NL*
And
you
'd
have
loved
your
money
so
that
you
'd
amass
not
two
million
,
*NL*
like
him
,
but
ten
million
;
and
you
'd
have
died
of
hunger
on
your
money
*NL*
bags
to
finish
up
with
,
for
you
carry
everything
to
extremes
.
'
There
,
*NL*
that
's
exactly
word
for
word
as
she
said
it
to
me
.
She
never
talked
to
*NL*
me
like
that
before
.
She
always
talks
nonsense
and
laughs
when
she
's
*NL*
with
me
.
We
went
all
over
this
old
house
together
.
'
I
shall
change
all
*NL*
this
,
'
I
said
,
`
or
else
I
'll
buy
a
new
house
for
the
wedding
.
'
`
No
,
no
!
'
*NL*
she
said
,
`
do
n't
touch
anything
;
leave
it
all
as
it
is
;
I
shall
live
*NL*
with
your
mother
when
I
marry
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
took
her
to
see
my
mother
,
and
she
was
as
respectful
and
kind
as
*NL*
though
she
were
her
own
daughter
.
Mother
has
been
almost
demented
ever
*NL*
since
father
died
--
she
's
an
old
woman
.
She
sits
and
bows
from
her
chair
*NL*
to
everyone
she
sees
.
If
you
left
her
alone
and
did
n't
feed
her
for
*NL*
three
days
,
I
do
n't
believe
she
would
notice
it
.
Well
,
I
took
her
hand
,
*NL*
and
I
said
,
`
Give
your
blessing
to
this
lady
,
mother
,
she
's
going
to
be
*NL*
my
wife
.
'
So
Nastasia
kissed
mother
's
hand
with
great
feeling
.
`
She
must
*NL*
have
suffered
terribly
,
has
n't
she
?
'
she
said
.
She
saw
this
book
here
*NL*
lying
before
me
.
`
What
!
have
you
begun
to
read
Russian
history
?
'
she
*NL*
asked
.
She
told
me
once
in
Moscow
,
you
know
,
that
I
had
better
get
*NL*
Solovieff
's
Russian
History
and
read
it
,
because
I
knew
nothing
.
`
That
's
*NL*
good
,
'
she
said
,
`
you
go
on
like
that
,
reading
books
.
I
'll
make
you
*NL*
a
list
myself
of
the
books
you
ought
to
read
first
--
shall
I
?
'
She
had
*NL*
never
once
spoken
to
me
like
this
before
;
it
was
the
first
time
I
felt
I
*NL*
could
breathe
before
her
like
a
living
creature
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
very
,
very
glad
to
hear
of
this
,
Parfen
,
''
said
the
prince
,
with
*NL*
real
feeling
.
``
Who
knows
?
Maybe
God
will
yet
bring
you
near
to
one
*NL*
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
,
never
!
''
cried
Rogojin
,
excitedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
,
Parfen
;
if
you
love
her
so
much
,
surely
you
must
be
anxious
*NL*
to
earn
her
respect
?
And
if
you
do
so
wish
,
surely
you
may
hope
to
?
I
*NL*
said
just
now
that
I
considered
it
extraordinary
that
she
could
still
be
*NL*
ready
to
marry
you
.
Well
,
though
I
can
not
yet
understand
it
,
I
feel
sure
*NL*
she
must
have
some
good
reason
,
or
she
would
n't
do
it
.
She
is
sure
*NL*
of
your
love
;
but
besides
that
,
she
must
attribute
_
something
_
else
to
*NL*
you
--
some
good
qualities
,
otherwise
the
thing
would
not
be
.
What
you
*NL*
have
just
said
confirms
my
words
.
You
say
yourself
that
she
found
it
*NL*
possible
to
speak
to
you
quite
differently
from
her
usual
manner
.
You
*NL*
are
suspicious
,
you
know
,
and
jealous
,
therefore
when
anything
annoying
*NL*
happens
to
you
,
you
exaggerate
its
significance
.
Of
course
,
of
course
,
*NL*
she
does
not
think
so
ill
of
you
as
you
say
.
Why
,
if
she
did
,
she
would
*NL*
simply
be
walking
to
death
by
drowning
or
by
the
knife
,
with
her
eyes
*NL*
wide
open
,
when
she
married
you
.
It
is
impossible
!
As
if
anybody
would
*NL*
go
to
their
death
deliberately
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rogojin
listened
to
the
prince
's
excited
words
with
a
bitter
smile
.
His
*NL*
conviction
was
,
apparently
,
unalterable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
dreadfully
you
look
at
me
,
Parfen
!
''
said
the
prince
,
with
a
feeling
*NL*
of
dread
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Water
or
the
knife
?
''
said
the
latter
,
at
last
.
``
Ha
,
ha
--
that
's
exactly
*NL*
why
she
is
going
to
marry
me
,
because
she
knows
for
certain
that
the
*NL*
knife
awaits
her
.
Prince
,
can
it
be
that
you
do
n't
even
yet
see
what
's
*NL*
at
the
root
of
it
all
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
you

Parfen

seizing
from
the

hand
a
knife

which
the
latter
had
at
that
moment
taken
up
from
the
table

where
it
*NL*
lay
beside
the
history

Parfen
replaced
it
where
it
had
been
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
seemed
to
know

I
felt
it

*NL*
continued
the
prince
,
``
I
did
not

altogether

good-bye

what
is

the

*NL*
*NL*
He
had
absently
taken
up
the
knife
a
second
time
,
and
again
Rogojin
*NL*
snatched
it
from
his
hand
,
and
threw
it
down
on
the
table
.
It
was
a
*NL*
plain
looking
knife
,
with
a
bone
handle
,
a
blade
about
eight
inches
long
,
*NL*
and
broad
in
proportion
,
it
did
not
clasp

*NL*
*NL*
Seeing
that
the
prince
was
considerably
struck
by
the
fact
that
he
had
*NL*
twice
seized
this
knife
out
of
his
hand
,
Rogojin
caught
it
up
with
*NL*
some
irritation
,
put
it
inside
the
book
,
and
threw
the
latter
across
to
*NL*
another
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
cut
your
pages
with
it
,
or
what

asked
Muishkin
,
still
rather
*NL*
absently
,
as
though
unable
to
throw
off
a
deep
preoccupation
into
which
*NL*
the
conversation
had
thrown
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
garden
knife

is
n't
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

Ca
n't
one
cut
pages
with
a

knife

*NL*
*NL*
``
It

quite
new

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
of
that
?
Ca
n't
I
buy
a
new
knife
if
I
like
?
''
shouted
Rogojin
*NL*
furiously
,
his
irritation
growing
with
every
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
shuddered
,
and
gazed
fixedly
at
Parfen
.
Suddenly
he
burst
out
*NL*
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
an
idea
!
''
he
said
.
``
I
did
n't
mean
to
ask
you
any
of
these
*NL*
questions
;
I
was
thinking
of
something
quite
different
!
But
my
head
is
*NL*
heavy
,
and
I
seem
so
absent-minded
nowadays
!
Well
,
good-bye
--
I
ca
n't
*NL*
remember
what
I
wanted
to
say
--
good-bye
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
that
way
,
''
said
Rogojin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
I
've
forgotten
that
too
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
way

come
along

I
'll
show
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
IV
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
passed
through
the
same
rooms
which
the
prince
had
traversed
on
his
*NL*
arrival
.
In
the
largest
there
were
pictures
on
the
walls
,
portraits
and
*NL*
landscapes
of
little
interest
.
Over
the
door
,
however
,
there
was
one
of
*NL*
strange
and
rather
striking
shape
;
it
was
six
or
seven
feet
in
length
,
*NL*
and
not
more
than
a
foot
in
height
.
It
represented
the
Saviour
just
*NL*
taken
from
the
cross
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
glanced
at
it
,
but
took
no
further
notice
.
He
moved
on
*NL*
hastily
,
as
though
anxious
to
get
out
of
the
house
.
But
Rogojin
suddenly
*NL*
stopped
underneath
the
picture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
father
picked
up
all
these
pictures
very
cheap
at
auctions
,
and
so
*NL*
on
,
''
he
said
;
``
they
are
all
rubbish
,
except
the
one
over
the
door
,
and
*NL*
that
is
valuable
.
A
man
offered
five
hundred
roubles
for
it
last
week
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
that
's
a
copy
of
a
Holbein
,
''
said
the
prince
,
looking
at
it
again
,
*NL*
``
and
a
good
copy
,
too
,
so
far
as
I
am
able
to
judge
.
I
saw
the
picture
*NL*
abroad
,
and
could
not
forget
it
--
what
's
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rogojin
had
dropped
the
subject
of
the
picture
and
walked
on
.
Of
course
*NL*
his
strange
frame
of
mind
was
sufficient
to
account
for
his
conduct
;
*NL*
but
,
still
,
it
seemed
queer
to
the
prince
that
he
should
so
abruptly
*NL*
drop
a
conversation
commenced
by
himself
.
Rogojin
did
not
take
any
*NL*
notice
of
his
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lef
Nicolaievitch
,
''
said
Rogojin
,
after
a
pause
,
during
which
the
two
*NL*
walked
along
a
little
further
,
``
I
have
long
wished
to
ask
you
,
do
you
*NL*
believe
in
God
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
strangely
you
speak
,
and
how
odd
you
look
!
''
said
the
other
,
*NL*
involuntarily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
looking
at
that
picture
,
''
muttered
Rogojin
,
not
noticing
,
*NL*
apparently
,
that
the
prince
had
not
answered
his
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
picture
!
That
picture
!
''
cried
Muishkin
,
struck
by
a
sudden
idea
.
*NL*
``
Why
,
a
man
's
faith
might
be
ruined
by
looking
at
that
picture
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
it
is
!
''
said
Rogojin
,
unexpectedly
.
They
had
now
reached
the
front
*NL*
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
?
''
he
said
.
``
What
do
you
mean
?
I
was
half
joking
,
and
you
took
me
up
*NL*
quite
seriously
!
Why
do
you
ask
me
whether
I
believe
in
God
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
particular
reason
.
I
meant
to
ask
you
before
--
many
people
are
*NL*
unbelievers
nowadays
,
especially
Russians
,
I
have
been
told
.
You
ought
*NL*
to
know
--
you
've
lived
abroad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rogojin
laughed
bitterly
as
he
said
these
words
,
and
opening
the
door
,
*NL*
held
it
for
the
prince
to
pass
out
.
Muishkin
looked
surprised
,
but
went
*NL*
out
.
The
other
followed
him
as
far
as
the
landing
of
the
outer
stairs
,
*NL*
and
shut
the
door
behind
him
.
They
both
now
stood
facing
one
another
,
as
*NL*
though
oblivious
of
where
they
were
,
or
what
they
had
to
do
next
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
good-bye
!
''
said
the
prince
,
holding
out
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
,
''
said
Rogojin
,
pressing
it
hard
,
but
quite
mechanically
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
made
one
step
forward
,
and
then
turned
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
to
faith
,
''
he
said
,
smiling
,
and
evidently
unwilling
to
leave
*NL*
Rogojin
in
this
state
--
``
as
to
faith
,
I
had
four
curious
conversations
*NL*
in
two
days
,
a
week
or
so
ago
.
One
morning
I
met
a
man
in
the
train
,
and
*NL*
made
acquaintance
with
him
at
once
.
I
had
often
heard
of
him
as
a
very
*NL*
learned
man
,
but
an
atheist
;
and
I
was
very
glad
of
the
opportunity
of
*NL*
conversing
with
so
eminent
and
clever
a
person
.
He
does
n't
believe
in
*NL*
God
,
and
he
talked
a
good
deal
about
it
,
but
all
the
while
it
appeared
*NL*
to
me
that
he
was
speaking
_
outside
the
subject
_
.
And
it
has
always
struck
*NL*
me
,
both
in
speaking
to
such
men
and
in
reading
their
books
,
that
they
*NL*
do
not
seem
really
to
be
touching
on
that
at
all
,
though
on
the
surface
*NL*
they
may
appear
to
do
so
.
I
told
him
this
,
but
I
dare
say
I
did
not
*NL*
clearly
express
what
I
meant
,
for
he
could
not
understand
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
same
evening
I
stopped
at
a
small
provincial
hotel
,
and
it
so
*NL*
happened
that
a
dreadful
murder
had
been
committed
there
the
night
*NL*
before
,
and
everybody
was
talking
about
it
.
Two
peasants
--
elderly
men
*NL*
and
old
friends
--
had
had
tea
together
there
the
night
before
,
and
were
*NL*
to
occupy
the
same
bedroom
.
They
were
not
drunk
but
one
of
them
had
*NL*
noticed
for
the
first
time
that
his
friend
possessed
a
silver
watch
*NL*
which
he
was
wearing
on
a
chain
.
He
was
by
no
means
a
thief
,
and
was
,
as
*NL*
peasants
go
,
a
rich
man
;
but
this
watch
so
fascinated
him
that
he
could
*NL*
not
restrain
himself
.
He
took
a
knife
,
and
when
his
friend
turned
his
*NL*
back
,
he
came
up
softly
behind
,
raised
his
eyes
to
heaven
,
crossed
*NL*
himself
,
and
saying
earnestly
--
`
God
forgive
me
,
for
Christ
's
sake
!
'
he
*NL*
cut
his
friend
's
throat
like
a
sheep
,
and
took
the
watch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rogojin
roared
with
laughter
.
He
laughed
as
though
he
were
in
a
sort
of
*NL*
fit
.
It
was
strange
to
see
him
laughing
so
after
the
sombre
mood
he
had
*NL*
been
in
just
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
like
that
!
That
beats
anything
!
''
he
cried
convulsively
,
panting
*NL*
for
breath
.
``
One
is
an
absolute
unbeliever
;
the
other
is
such
a
*NL*
thorough
--
going
believer
that
he
murders
his
friend
to
the
tune
of
a
*NL*
prayer
!
Oh
,
prince
,
prince
,
that
's
too
good
for
anything
!
You
ca
n't
have
*NL*
invented
it
.
It
's
the
best
thing
I
've
heard
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Next
morning
I
went
out
for
a
stroll
through
the
town
,
''
continued
the
*NL*
prince
,
so
soon
as
Rogojin
was
a
little
quieter
,
though
his
laughter
*NL*
still
burst
out
at
intervals
,
``
and
soon
observed
a
drunken-looking
*NL*
soldier
staggering
about
the
pavement
.
He
came
up
to
me
and
said
,
*NL*
`
Buy
my
silver
cross
,
sir
!
You
shall
have
it
for
fourpence
--
it
's
real
*NL*
silver
.
'
I
looked
,
and
there
he
held
a
cross
,
just
taken
off
his
own
*NL*
neck
,
evidently
,
a
large
tin
one
,
made
after
the
Byzantine
pattern
.
I
*NL*
fished
out
fourpence
,
and
put
his
cross
on
my
own
neck
,
and
I
could
see
*NL*
by
his
face
that
he
was
as
pleased
as
he
could
be
at
the
thought
that
he
*NL*
had
succeeded
in
cheating
a
foolish
gentleman
,
and
away
he
went
to
*NL*
drink
the
value
of
his
cross
.
At
that
time
everything
that
I
saw
made
*NL*
a
tremendous
impression
upon
me
.
I
had
understood
nothing
about
Russia
*NL*
before
,
and
had
only
vague
and
fantastic
memories
of
it
.
So
I
thought
,
*NL*
'
I
will
wait
awhile
before
I
condemn
this
Judas
.
Only
God
knows
what
may
*NL*
be
hidden
in
the
hearts
of
drunkards
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
went
homewards
,
and
near
the
hotel
I
came
across
a
poor
woman
,
*NL*
carrying
a
child
--
a
baby
of
some
six
weeks
old
.
The
mother
was
quite
a
*NL*
girl
herself
.
The
baby
was
smiling
up
at
her
,
for
the
first
time
in
its
*NL*
life
,
just
at
that
moment
;
and
while
I
watched
the
woman
she
suddenly
*NL*
crossed
herself
,
oh
,
so
devoutly
!
`
What
is
it
,
my
good
woman
I
asked
*NL*
her
.
-LRB-
I
was
never
but
asking
questions
then
!
-RRB-
Exactly
as
is
a
mother
's
*NL*
joy
when
her
baby
smiles
for
the
first
time
into
her
eyes
,
so
is
God
's
*NL*
joy
when
one
of
His
children
turns
and
prays
to
Him
for
the
first
time
,
*NL*
with
all
his
heart
!
'
This
is
what
that
poor
woman
said
to
me
,
almost
*NL*
word
for
word
;
and
such
a
deep
,
refined
,
truly
religious
thought
it
*NL*
was
--
a
thought
in
which
the
whole
essence
of
Christianity
was
expressed
*NL*
in
one
flash
--
that
is
,
the
recognition
of
God
as
our
Father
,
and
of
*NL*
God
's
joy
in
men
as
His
own
children
,
which
is
the
chief
idea
of
Christ
.
*NL*
She
was
a
simple
country-woman
--
a
mother
,
it
's
true
--
and
perhaps
,
who
*NL*
knows
,
she
may
have
been
the
wife
of
the
drunken
soldier
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
Parfen
;
you
put
a
question
to
me
just
now
.
This
is
my
reply
.
*NL*
The
essence
of
religious
feeling
has
nothing
to
do
with
reason
,
or
*NL*
atheism
,
or
crime
,
or
acts
of
any
kind
--
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
these
*NL*
things
--
and
never
had
.
There
is
something
besides
all
this
,
something
*NL*
which
the
arguments
of
the
atheists
can
never
touch
.
But
the
principal
*NL*
thing
,
and
the
conclusion
of
my
argument
,
is
that
this
is
most
clearly
*NL*
seen
in
the
heart
of
a
Russian
.
This
is
a
conviction
which
I
have
gained
*NL*
while
I
have
been
in
this
Russia
of
ours
.
Yes
,
Parfen
!
there
is
work
to
*NL*
be
done
;
there
is
work
to
be
done
in
this
Russian
world
!
Remember
what
*NL*
talks
we
used
to
have
in
Moscow
!
And
I
never
wished
to
come
here
at
*NL*
all
;
and
I
never
thought
to
meet
you
like
this
,
Parfen
!
Well
,
*NL*
well
--
good-bye
--
good-bye
!
God
be
with
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
and
went
downstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lef
Nicolaievitch
!
''
cried
Parfen
,
before
he
had
reached
the
next
*NL*
landing
.
``
Have
you
got
that
cross
you
bought
from
the
soldier
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
have
,
''
and
the
prince
stopped
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Show
it
me
,
will
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
new
fancy
!
The
prince
reflected
,
and
then
mounted
the
stairs
once
*NL*
more
.
He
pulled
out
the
cross
without
taking
it
off
his
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
it
to
me
,
''
said
Parfen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
do
you
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
would
rather
have
kept
this
particular
cross
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
wear
it
;
and
you
shall
have
mine
.
I
'll
take
it
off
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wish
to
exchange
crosses
?
Very
well
,
Parfen
,
if
that
's
the
case
,
*NL*
I
'm
glad
enough
--
that
makes
us
brothers
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
took
off
his
tin
cross
,
Parfen
his
gold
one
,
and
the
exchange
*NL*
was
made
.
*NL*
*NL*
Parfen
was
silent
.
With
sad
surprise
the
prince
observed
that
the
look
*NL*
of
distrust
,
the
bitter
,
ironical
smile
,
had
still
not
altogether
left
*NL*
his
newly-adopted
brother
's
face
.
At
moments
,
at
all
events
,
it
showed
*NL*
itself
but
too
plainly
,
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
Rogojin
took
the
prince
's
hand
,
and
stood
so
for
some
moments
,
*NL*
as
though
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
.
Then
he
drew
him
along
,
*NL*
murmuring
almost
inaudibly
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
stopped
on
the
landing
,
and
rang
the
bell
at
a
door
opposite
to
*NL*
Parfen
's
own
lodging
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
old
woman
opened
to
them
and
bowed
low
to
Parfen
,
who
asked
her
some
*NL*
questions
hurriedly
,
but
did
not
wait
to
hear
her
answer
.
He
led
the
*NL*
prince
on
through
several
dark
,
cold-looking
rooms
,
spotlessly
clean
,
*NL*
with
white
covers
over
all
the
furniture
.
*NL*
*NL*
Without
the
ceremony
of
knocking
,
Parfen
entered
a
small
apartment
,
*NL*
furnished
like
a
drawing-room
,
but
with
a
polished
mahogany
partition
*NL*
dividing
one
half
of
it
from
what
was
probably
a
bedroom
.
In
one
corner
*NL*
of
this
room
sat
an
old
woman
in
an
arm-chair
,
close
to
the
stove
.
She
*NL*
did
not
look
very
old
,
and
her
face
was
a
pleasant
,
round
one
;
but
she
*NL*
was
white-haired
and
,
as
one
could
detect
at
the
first
glance
,
quite
*NL*
in
her
second
childhood
.
She
wore
a
black
woollen
dress
,
with
a
black
*NL*
handkerchief
round
her
neck
and
shoulders
,
and
a
white
cap
with
black
*NL*
ribbons
.
Her
feet
were
raised
on
a
footstool
.
Beside
her
sat
another
old
*NL*
woman
,
also
dressed
in
mourning
,
and
silently
knitting
a
stocking
;
this
*NL*
was
evidently
a
companion
.
They
both
looked
as
though
they
never
broke
*NL*
the
silence
.
The
first
old
woman
,
so
soon
as
she
saw
Rogojin
and
the
*NL*
prince
,
smiled
and
bowed
courteously
several
times
,
in
token
of
her
*NL*
gratification
at
their
visit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
,
''
said
Rogojin
,
kissing
her
hand
,
``
here
is
my
great
friend
,
*NL*
Prince
Muishkin
;
we
have
exchanged
crosses
;
he
was
like
a
real
brother
*NL*
to
me
at
Moscow
at
one
time
,
and
did
a
great
deal
for
me
.
Bless
him
,
*NL*
mother
,
as
you
would
bless
your
own
son
.
Wait
a
moment
,
let
me
arrange
*NL*
your
hands
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
old
lady
,
before
Parfen
had
time
to
touch
her
,
raised
her
right
*NL*
hand
,
and
,
with
three
fingers
held
up
,
devoutly
made
the
sign
of
the
*NL*
cross
three
times
over
the
prince
.
She
then
nodded
her
head
kindly
at
*NL*
him
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
come
along
,
Lef
Nicolaievitch
;
that
's
all
I
brought
you
here
*NL*
for
,
''
said
Rogojin
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
reached
the
stairs
again
he
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
understood
nothing
of
what
I
said
to
her
,
and
did
not
know
what
I
*NL*
wanted
her
to
do
,
and
yet
she
blessed
you
;
that
shows
she
wished
to
do
*NL*
so
herself
.
Well
,
goodbye
;
it
's
time
you
went
,
and
I
must
go
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
opened
his
own
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
let
me
at
least
embrace
you
and
say
goodbye
,
you
strange
fellow
!
''
*NL*
cried
the
prince
,
looking
with
gentle
reproach
at
Rogojin
,
and
advancing
*NL*
towards
him
.
But
the
latter
had
hardly
raised
his
arms
when
he
dropped
*NL*
them
again
.
He
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
it
;
he
turned
away
from
the
*NL*
prince
in
order
to
avoid
looking
at
him
.
He
could
not
embrace
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
afraid
,
''
he
muttered
,
indistinctly
,
``
though
I
have
taken
your
*NL*
cross
,
I
shall
not
murder
you
for
your
watch
.
''
So
saying
,
he
laughed
*NL*
suddenly
,
and
strangely
.
Then
in
a
moment
his
face
became
transfigured
;
*NL*
he
grew
deadly
white
,
his
lips
trembled
,
his
eyes
burned
like
fire
.
He
*NL*
stretched
out
his
arms
and
held
the
prince
tightly
to
him
,
and
said
in
a
*NL*
strangled
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
take
her
!
It
's
Fate
!
She
's
yours
.
I
surrender
her
...
Remember
*NL*
Rogojin
!
''
And
pushing
the
prince
from
him
,
without
looking
back
at
him
,
*NL*
he
hurriedly
entered
his
own
flat
,
and
banged
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
V
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
late
now
,
nearly
half-past
two
,
and
the
prince
did
not
find
*NL*
General
Epanchin
at
home
.
He
left
a
card
,
and
determined
to
look
up
*NL*
Colia
,
who
had
a
room
at
a
small
hotel
near
.
Colia
was
not
in
,
but
he
*NL*
was
informed
that
he
might
be
back
shortly
,
and
had
left
word
that
if
he
*NL*
were
not
in
by
half-past
three
it
was
to
be
understood
that
he
had
gone
*NL*
to
Pavlofsk
to
General
Epanchin
's
,
and
would
dine
there
.
The
prince
*NL*
decided
to
wait
till
half-past
three
,
and
ordered
some
dinner
.
At
*NL*
half-past
three
there
was
no
sign
of
Colia
.
The
prince
waited
until
four
*NL*
o'clock
,
and
then
strolled
off
mechanically
wherever
his
feet
should
*NL*
carry
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
early
summer
there
are
often
magnificent
days
in
St.
*NL*
Petersburg
--
bright
,
hot
and
still
.
This
happened
to
be
such
a
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
some
time
the
prince
wandered
about
without
aim
or
object
.
He
did
*NL*
not
know
the
town
well
.
He
stopped
to
look
about
him
on
bridges
,
at
*NL*
street
corners
.
He
entered
a
confectioner
's
shop
to
rest
,
once
.
He
was
*NL*
in
a
state
of
nervous
excitement
and
perturbation
;
he
noticed
nothing
*NL*
and
no
one
;
and
he
felt
a
craving
for
solitude
,
to
be
alone
with
his
*NL*
thoughts
and
his
emotions
,
and
to
give
himself
up
to
them
passively
.
He
*NL*
loathed
the
idea
of
trying
to
answer
the
questions
that
would
rise
up
*NL*
in
his
heart
and
mind
.
``
I
am
not
to
blame
for
all
this
,
''
he
thought
to
*NL*
himself
,
half
unconsciously
.
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
six
o'clock
he
found
himself
at
the
station
of
the
*NL*
Tsarsko-Selski
railway
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
tired
of
solitude
now
;
a
new
rush
of
feeling
took
hold
of
him
,
*NL*
and
a
flood
of
light
chased
away
the
gloom
,
for
a
moment
,
from
his
soul
.
*NL*
He
took
a
ticket
to
Pavlofsk
,
and
determined
to
get
there
as
fast
as
he
*NL*
could
,
but
something
stopped
him
;
a
reality
,
and
not
a
fantasy
,
as
he
*NL*
was
inclined
to
think
it
.
He
was
about
to
take
his
place
in
a
carriage
,
*NL*
when
he
suddenly
threw
away
his
ticket
and
came
out
again
,
disturbed
and
*NL*
thoughtful
.
A
few
moments
later
,
in
the
street
,
he
recalled
something
*NL*
that
had
bothered
him
all
the
afternoon
.
He
caught
himself
engaged
in
*NL*
a
strange
occupation
which
he
now
recollected
he
had
taken
up
at
odd
*NL*
moments
for
the
last
few
hours
--
it
was
looking
about
all
around
him
for
*NL*
something
,
he
did
not
know
what
.
He
had
forgotten
it
for
a
while
,
half
*NL*
an
hour
or
so
,
and
now
,
suddenly
,
the
uneasy
search
had
recommenced
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
had
hardly
become
conscious
of
this
curious
phenomenon
,
when
*NL*
another
recollection
suddenly
swam
through
his
brain
,
interesting
him
*NL*
for
the
moment
,
exceedingly
.
He
remembered
that
the
last
time
he
had
*NL*
been
engaged
in
looking
around
him
for
the
unknown
something
,
he
was
*NL*
standing
before
a
cutler
's
shop
,
in
the
window
of
which
were
exposed
*NL*
certain
goods
for
sale
.
He
was
extremely
anxious
now
to
discover
whether
*NL*
this
shop
and
these
goods
really
existed
,
or
whether
the
whole
thing
had
*NL*
been
a
hallucination
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
in
a
very
curious
condition
today
,
a
condition
similar
to
that
*NL*
which
had
preceded
his
fits
in
bygone
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
remembered
that
at
such
times
he
had
been
particularly
absentminded
,
*NL*
and
could
not
discriminate
between
objects
and
persons
unless
he
*NL*
concentrated
special
attention
upon
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
remembered
seeing
something
in
the
window
marked
at
sixty
copecks
.
*NL*
Therefore
,
if
the
shop
existed
and
if
this
object
were
really
in
*NL*
the
window
,
it
would
prove
that
he
had
been
able
to
concentrate
his
*NL*
attention
on
this
article
at
a
moment
when
,
as
a
general
rule
,
*NL*
his
absence
of
mind
would
have
been
too
great
to
admit
of
any
such
*NL*
concentration
;
in
fact
,
very
shortly
after
he
had
left
the
railway
*NL*
station
in
such
a
state
of
agitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
walked
back
looking
about
him
for
the
shop
,
and
his
heart
beat
*NL*
with
intolerable
impatience
.
Ah
!
here
was
the
very
shop
,
and
there
was
*NL*
the
article
marked
``
60
cop
.
''
Of
course
,
it
's
sixty
copecks
,
he
thought
,
*NL*
and
certainly
worth
no
more
.
This
idea
amused
him
and
he
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
a
hysterical
laugh
;
he
was
feeling
terribly
oppressed
.
He
*NL*
remembered
clearly
that
just
here
,
standing
before
this
window
,
he
had
*NL*
suddenly
turned
round
,
just
as
earlier
in
the
day
he
had
turned
and
*NL*
found
the
dreadful
eyes
of
Rogojin
fixed
upon
him
.
Convinced
,
therefore
,
*NL*
that
in
this
respect
at
all
events
he
had
been
under
no
delusion
,
he
*NL*
left
the
shop
and
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
must
be
thought
out
;
it
was
clear
that
there
had
been
no
*NL*
hallucination
at
the
station
then
,
either
;
something
had
actually
*NL*
happened
to
him
,
on
both
occasions
;
there
was
no
doubt
of
it
.
But
again
*NL*
a
loathing
for
all
mental
exertion
overmastered
him
;
he
would
not
*NL*
think
it
out
now
,
he
would
put
it
off
and
think
of
something
else
.
*NL*
He
remembered
that
during
his
epileptic
fits
,
or
rather
immediately
*NL*
preceding
them
,
he
had
always
experienced
a
moment
or
two
when
his
whole
*NL*
heart
,
and
mind
,
and
body
seemed
to
wake
up
to
vigour
and
light
;
when
*NL*
he
became
filled
with
joy
and
hope
,
and
all
his
anxieties
seemed
to
be
*NL*
swept
away
for
ever
;
these
moments
were
but
presentiments
,
as
it
were
,
*NL*
of
the
one
final
second
-LRB-
it
was
never
more
than
a
second
-RRB-
in
which
the
*NL*
fit
came
upon
him
.
That
second
,
of
course
,
was
inexpressible
.
When
his
*NL*
attack
was
over
,
and
the
prince
reflected
on
his
symptoms
,
he
used
to
*NL*
say
to
himself
:
``
These
moments
,
short
as
they
are
,
when
I
feel
such
*NL*
extreme
consciousness
of
myself
,
and
consequently
more
of
life
than
*NL*
at
other
times
,
are
due
only
to
the
disease
--
to
the
sudden
rupture
of
*NL*
normal
conditions
.
Therefore
they
are
not
really
a
higher
kind
of
life
,
*NL*
but
a
lower
.
''
This
reasoning
,
however
,
seemed
to
end
in
a
paradox
,
*NL*
and
lead
to
the
further
consideration
:
--
``
What
matter
though
it
be
only
*NL*
disease
,
an
abnormal
tension
of
the
brain
,
if
when
I
recall
and
analyze
*NL*
the
moment
,
it
seems
to
have
been
one
of
harmony
and
beauty
in
the
*NL*
highest
degree
--
an
instant
of
deepest
sensation
,
overflowing
with
*NL*
unbounded
joy
and
rapture
,
ecstatic
devotion
,
and
completest
life
?
''
*NL*
Vague
though
this
sounds
,
it
was
perfectly
comprehensible
to
Muishkin
,
*NL*
though
he
knew
that
it
was
but
a
feeble
expression
of
his
sensations
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
there
was
,
indeed
,
beauty
and
harmony
in
those
abnormal
moments
,
*NL*
that
they
really
contained
the
highest
synthesis
of
life
,
he
could
not
*NL*
doubt
,
nor
even
admit
the
possibility
of
doubt
.
He
felt
that
they
were
*NL*
not
analogous
to
the
fantastic
and
unreal
dreams
due
to
intoxication
*NL*
by
hashish
,
opium
or
wine
.
Of
that
he
could
judge
,
when
the
attack
was
*NL*
over
.
These
instants
were
characterized
--
to
define
it
in
a
word
--
by
*NL*
an
intense
quickening
of
the
sense
of
personality
.
Since
,
in
the
last
*NL*
conscious
moment
preceding
the
attack
,
he
could
say
to
himself
,
with
*NL*
full
understanding
of
his
words
:
``
I
would
give
my
whole
life
for
this
*NL*
one
instant
,
''
then
doubtless
to
him
it
really
was
worth
a
lifetime
.
*NL*
For
the
rest
,
he
thought
the
dialectical
part
of
his
argument
of
little
*NL*
worth
;
he
saw
only
too
clearly
that
the
result
of
these
ecstatic
moments
*NL*
was
stupefaction
,
mental
darkness
,
idiocy
.
No
argument
was
possible
*NL*
on
that
point
.
His
conclusion
,
his
estimate
of
the
``
moment
,
''
doubtless
*NL*
contained
some
error
,
yet
the
reality
of
the
sensation
troubled
him
.
*NL*
What
's
more
unanswerable
than
a
fact
?
And
this
fact
had
occurred
.
The
*NL*
prince
had
confessed
unreservedly
to
himself
that
the
feeling
of
intense
*NL*
beatitude
in
that
crowded
moment
made
the
moment
worth
a
lifetime
.
``
I
*NL*
feel
then
,
''
he
said
one
day
to
Rogojin
in
Moscow
,
``
I
feel
then
as
if
I
*NL*
understood
those
amazing
words
--
`
There
shall
be
no
more
time
.
'
''
And
he
*NL*
added
with
a
smile
:
``
No
doubt
the
epileptic
Mahomet
refers
to
that
same
*NL*
moment
when
he
says
that
he
visited
all
the
dwellings
of
Allah
,
in
less
*NL*
time
than
was
needed
to
empty
his
pitcher
of
water
.
''
Yes
,
he
had
often
*NL*
met
Rogojin
in
Moscow
,
and
many
were
the
subjects
they
discussed
.
``
He
*NL*
told
me
I
had
been
a
brother
to
him
,
''
thought
the
prince
.
``
He
said
so
*NL*
today
,
for
the
first
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
sitting
in
the
Summer
Garden
on
a
seat
under
a
tree
,
and
his
*NL*
mind
dwelt
on
the
matter
.
It
was
about
seven
o'clock
,
and
the
place
was
*NL*
empty
.
The
stifling
atmosphere
foretold
a
storm
,
and
the
prince
felt
a
*NL*
certain
charm
in
the
contemplative
mood
which
possessed
him
.
He
found
*NL*
pleasure
,
too
,
in
gazing
at
the
exterior
objects
around
him
.
All
the
*NL*
time
he
was
trying
to
forget
some
thing
,
to
escape
from
some
idea
that
*NL*
haunted
him
;
but
melancholy
thoughts
came
back
,
though
he
would
so
*NL*
willingly
have
escaped
from
them
.
He
remembered
suddenly
how
he
had
been
*NL*
talking
to
the
waiter
,
while
he
dined
,
about
a
recently
committed
murder
*NL*
which
the
whole
town
was
discussing
,
and
as
he
thought
of
it
something
*NL*
strange
came
over
him
.
He
was
seized
all
at
once
by
a
violent
desire
,
*NL*
almost
a
temptation
,
against
which
he
strove
in
vain
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
jumped
up
and
walked
off
as
fast
as
he
could
towards
the
``
Petersburg
*NL*
Side
.
''
-LSB-
One
of
the
quarters
of
St.
Petersburg
.
-RSB-
He
had
asked
someone
,
a
*NL*
little
while
before
,
to
show
him
which
was
the
Petersburg
Side
,
on
the
*NL*
banks
of
the
Neva
.
He
had
not
gone
there
,
however
;
and
he
knew
very
*NL*
well
that
it
was
of
no
use
to
go
now
,
for
he
would
certainly
not
find
*NL*
Lebedeff
's
relation
at
home
.
He
had
the
address
,
but
she
must
certainly
*NL*
have
gone
to
Pavlofsk
,
or
Colia
would
have
let
him
know
.
If
he
were
to
*NL*
go
now
,
it
would
merely
be
out
of
curiosity
,
but
a
sudden
,
new
idea
had
*NL*
come
into
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
it
was
something
to
move
on
and
know
where
he
was
going
.
A
*NL*
minute
later
he
was
still
moving
on
,
but
without
knowing
anything
.
He
*NL*
could
no
longer
think
out
his
new
idea
.
He
tried
to
take
an
interest
in
*NL*
all
he
saw
;
in
the
sky
,
in
the
Neva
.
He
spoke
to
some
children
he
met
.
*NL*
He
felt
his
epileptic
condition
becoming
more
and
more
developed
.
The
*NL*
evening
was
very
close
;
thunder
was
heard
some
way
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
was
haunted
all
that
day
by
the
face
of
Lebedeff
's
nephew
*NL*
whom
he
had
seen
for
the
first
time
that
morning
,
just
as
one
is
haunted
*NL*
at
times
by
some
persistent
musical
refrain
.
By
a
curious
association
*NL*
of
ideas
,
the
young
man
always
appeared
as
the
murderer
of
whom
Lebedeff
*NL*
had
spoken
when
introducing
him
to
Muishkin
.
Yes
,
he
had
read
something
*NL*
about
the
murder
,
and
that
quite
recently
.
Since
he
came
to
Russia
,
he
*NL*
had
heard
many
stories
of
this
kind
,
and
was
interested
in
them
.
His
*NL*
conversation
with
the
waiter
,
an
hour
ago
,
chanced
to
be
on
the
subject
*NL*
of
this
murder
of
the
Zemarins
,
and
the
latter
had
agreed
with
him
about
*NL*
it
.
He
thought
of
the
waiter
again
,
and
decided
that
he
was
no
fool
,
but
*NL*
a
steady
,
intelligent
man
:
though
,
said
he
to
himself
,
``
God
knows
*NL*
what
he
may
really
be
;
in
a
country
with
which
one
is
unfamiliar
it
is
*NL*
difficult
to
understand
the
people
one
meets
.
''
He
was
beginning
to
have
*NL*
a
passionate
faith
in
the
Russian
soul
,
however
,
and
what
discoveries
he
*NL*
had
made
in
the
last
six
months
,
what
unexpected
discoveries
!
But
every
*NL*
soul
is
a
mystery
,
and
depths
of
mystery
lie
in
the
soul
of
a
Russian
.
*NL*
He
had
been
intimate
with
Rogojin
,
for
example
,
and
a
brotherly
*NL*
friendship
had
sprung
up
between
them
--
yet
did
he
really
know
him
?
*NL*
What
chaos
and
ugliness
fills
the
world
at
times
!
What
a
self-satisfied
*NL*
rascal
is
that
nephew
of
Lebedeff
's
!
``
But
what
am
I
thinking
,
''
continued
*NL*
the
prince
to
himself
.
``
Can
he
really
have
committed
that
crime
?
Did
he
*NL*
kill
those
six
persons
?
I
seem
to
be
confusing
things
...
how
strange
*NL*
it
all
is
...
My
head
goes
round
...
And
Lebedeff
's
daughter
--
how
*NL*
sympathetic
and
charming
her
face
was
as
she
held
the
child
in
her
arms
!
*NL*
What
an
innocent
look
and
child-like
laugh
she
had
!
It
is
curious
that
I
*NL*
had
forgotten
her
until
now
.
I
expect
Lebedeff
adores
her
--
and
I
really
*NL*
believe
,
when
I
think
of
it
,
that
as
sure
as
two
and
two
make
four
,
he
*NL*
is
fond
of
that
nephew
,
too
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
why
should
he
judge
them
so
hastily
!
Could
he
really
say
what
they
*NL*
were
,
after
one
short
visit
?
Even
Lebedeff
seemed
an
enigma
today
.
*NL*
Did
he
expect
to
find
him
so
?
He
had
never
seen
him
like
that
before
.
*NL*
Lebedeff
and
the
Comtesse
du
Barry
!
Good
Heavens
!
If
Rogojin
should
*NL*
really
kill
someone
,
it
would
not
,
at
any
rate
,
be
such
a
senseless
,
*NL*
chaotic
affair
.
A
knife
made
to
a
special
pattern
,
and
six
people
killed
*NL*
in
a
kind
of
delirium
.
But
Rogojin
also
had
a
knife
made
to
a
special
*NL*
pattern
.
Can
it
be
that
Rogojin
wishes
to
murder
anyone
?
The
prince
*NL*
began
to
tremble
violently
.
``
It
is
a
crime
on
my
part
to
imagine
*NL*
anything
so
base
,
with
such
cynical
frankness
.
''
His
face
reddened
with
*NL*
shame
at
the
thought
;
and
then
there
came
across
him
as
in
a
flash
*NL*
the
memory
of
the
incidents
at
the
Pavlofsk
station
,
and
at
the
other
*NL*
station
in
the
morning
;
and
the
question
asked
him
by
Rogojin
about
*NL*
_
the
eyes
_
and
Rogojin
's
cross
,
that
he
was
even
now
wearing
;
and
the
*NL*
benediction
of
Rogojin
's
mother
;
and
his
embrace
on
the
darkened
*NL*
staircase
--
that
last
supreme
renunciation
--
and
now
,
to
find
himself
full
*NL*
of
this
new
``
idea
,
''
staring
into
shop-windows
,
and
looking
round
for
*NL*
things
--
how
base
he
was
!
*NL*
*NL*
Despair
overmastered
his
soul
;
he
would
not
go
on
,
he
would
go
back
to
*NL*
his
hotel
;
he
even
turned
and
went
the
other
way
;
but
a
moment
after
he
*NL*
changed
his
mind
again
and
went
on
in
the
old
direction
.
*NL*
*NL*
Why
,
here
he
was
on
the
Petersburg
Side
already
,
quite
close
to
the
*NL*
house
!
Where
was
his
``
idea
''
?
He
was
marching
along
without
it
now
.
Yes
,
*NL*
his
malady
was
coming
back
,
it
was
clear
enough
;
all
this
gloom
and
*NL*
heaviness
,
all
these
``
ideas
,
''
were
nothing
more
nor
less
than
a
fit
*NL*
coming
on
;
perhaps
he
would
have
a
fit
this
very
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
just
now
all
the
gloom
and
darkness
had
fled
,
his
heart
felt
full
of
*NL*
joy
and
hope
,
there
was
no
such
thing
as
doubt
.
And
yes
,
he
had
n't
*NL*
seen
her
for
so
long
;
he
really
must
see
her
.
He
wished
he
could
meet
*NL*
Rogojin
;
he
would
take
his
hand
,
and
they
would
go
to
her
together
.
His
*NL*
heart
was
pure
,
he
was
no
rival
of
Parfen
's
.
Tomorrow
,
he
would
go
*NL*
and
tell
him
that
he
had
seen
her
.
Why
,
he
had
only
come
for
the
sole
*NL*
purpose
of
seeing
her
,
all
the
way
from
Moscow
!
Perhaps
she
might
be
*NL*
here
still
,
who
knows
?
She
might
not
have
gone
away
to
Pavlofsk
yet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
all
this
must
be
put
straight
and
above-board
,
there
must
be
no
*NL*
more
passionate
renouncements
,
such
as
Rogojin
's
.
It
must
all
be
clear
*NL*
as
day
.
Can
not
Rogojin
's
soul
bear
the
light
?
He
said
he
did
not
love
*NL*
her
with
sympathy
and
pity
;
true
,
he
added
that
``
your
pity
is
greater
*NL*
than
my
love
,
''
but
he
was
not
quite
fair
on
himself
there
.
Kin
!
Rogojin
*NL*
reading
a
book
--
was
n't
that
sympathy
beginning
?
Did
it
not
show
that
he
*NL*
comprehended
his
relations
with
her
?
And
his
story
of
waiting
day
and
*NL*
night
for
her
forgiveness
?
That
did
n't
look
quite
like
passion
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
as
to
her
face
,
could
it
inspire
nothing
but
passion
?
Could
her
*NL*
face
inspire
passion
at
all
now
?
Oh
,
it
inspired
suffering
,
grief
,
*NL*
overwhelming
grief
of
the
soul
!
A
poignant
,
agonizing
memory
swept
over
*NL*
the
prince
's
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
agonizing
.
He
remembered
how
he
had
suffered
that
first
day
when
he
*NL*
thought
he
observed
in
her
the
symptoms
of
madness
.
He
had
almost
fallen
*NL*
into
despair
.
How
could
he
have
lost
his
hold
upon
her
when
she
ran
away
*NL*
from
him
to
Rogojin
?
He
ought
to
have
run
after
her
himself
,
rather
than
*NL*
wait
for
news
as
he
had
done
.
Can
Rogojin
have
failed
to
observe
,
up
*NL*
to
now
,
that
she
is
mad
?
Rogojin
attributes
her
strangeness
to
other
*NL*
causes
,
to
passion
!
What
insane
jealousy
!
What
was
it
he
had
hinted
at
*NL*
in
that
suggestion
of
his
?
The
prince
suddenly
blushed
,
and
shuddered
to
*NL*
his
very
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
why
recall
all
this
?
There
was
insanity
on
both
sides
.
For
him
,
the
*NL*
prince
,
to
love
this
woman
with
passion
,
was
unthinkable
.
It
would
be
*NL*
cruel
and
inhuman
.
Yes
.
Rogojin
is
not
fair
to
himself
;
he
has
a
large
*NL*
heart
;
he
has
aptitude
for
sympathy
.
When
he
learns
the
truth
,
and
finds
*NL*
what
a
pitiable
being
is
this
injured
,
broken
,
half-insane
creature
,
he
*NL*
will
forgive
her
all
the
torment
she
has
caused
him
.
He
will
become
her
*NL*
slave
,
her
brother
,
her
friend
.
Compassion
will
teach
even
Rogojin
,
*NL*
it
will
show
him
how
to
reason
.
Compassion
is
the
chief
law
of
human
*NL*
existence
.
Oh
,
how
guilty
he
felt
towards
Rogojin
!
And
,
for
a
few
warm
,
*NL*
hasty
words
spoken
in
Moscow
,
Parfen
had
called
him
``
brother
,
''
while
*NL*
he
--
but
no
,
this
was
delirium
!
It
would
all
come
right
!
That
gloomy
*NL*
Parfen
had
implied
that
his
faith
was
waning
;
he
must
suffer
dreadfully
.
*NL*
He
said
he
liked
to
look
at
that
picture
;
it
was
not
that
he
liked
*NL*
it
,
but
he
felt
the
need
of
looking
at
it
.
Rogojin
was
not
merely
a
*NL*
passionate
soul
;
he
was
a
fighter
.
He
was
fighting
for
the
restoration
*NL*
of
his
dying
faith
.
He
must
have
something
to
hold
on
to
and
believe
,
*NL*
and
someone
to
believe
in
.
What
a
strange
picture
that
of
Holbein
's
is
!
*NL*
Why
,
this
is
the
street
,
and
here
's
the
house
,
No.
16
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
rang
the
bell
,
and
asked
for
Nastasia
Philipovna
.
The
lady
of
*NL*
the
house
came
out
,
and
stated
that
Nastasia
had
gone
to
stay
with
Daria
*NL*
Alexeyevna
at
Pavlofsk
,
and
might
be
there
some
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Filisoff
was
a
little
woman
of
forty
,
with
a
cunning
face
,
and
*NL*
crafty
,
piercing
eyes
.
When
,
with
an
air
of
mystery
,
she
asked
her
*NL*
visitor
's
name
,
he
refused
at
first
to
answer
,
but
in
a
moment
he
*NL*
changed
his
mind
,
and
left
strict
instructions
that
it
should
be
given
*NL*
to
Nastasia
Philipovna
.
The
urgency
of
his
request
seemed
to
impress
*NL*
Madame
Filisoff
,
and
she
put
on
a
knowing
expression
,
as
if
to
say
,
``
You
*NL*
need
not
be
afraid
,
I
quite
understand
.
''
The
prince
's
name
evidently
*NL*
was
a
great
surprise
to
her
.
He
stood
and
looked
absently
at
her
for
a
*NL*
moment
,
then
turned
,
and
took
the
road
back
to
his
hotel
.
But
he
went
*NL*
away
not
as
he
came
.
A
great
change
had
suddenly
come
over
him
.
He
went
*NL*
blindly
forward
;
his
knees
shook
under
him
;
he
was
tormented
by
``
ideas
''
;
*NL*
his
lips
were
blue
,
and
trembled
with
a
feeble
,
meaningless
smile
.
His
*NL*
demon
was
upon
him
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
had
happened
to
him
?
Why
was
his
brow
clammy
with
drops
of
*NL*
moisture
,
his
knees
shaking
beneath
him
,
and
his
soul
oppressed
with
a
*NL*
cold
gloom
?
Was
it
because
he
had
just
seen
these
dreadful
eyes
again
?
*NL*
Why
,
he
had
left
the
Summer
Garden
on
purpose
to
see
them
;
that
had
been
*NL*
his
``
idea
.
''
He
had
wished
to
assure
himself
that
he
would
see
them
once
*NL*
more
at
that
house
.
Then
why
was
he
so
overwhelmed
now
,
having
seen
them
*NL*
as
he
expected
?
just
as
though
he
had
not
expected
to
see
them
!
Yes
,
*NL*
they
were
the
very
same
eyes
;
and
no
doubt
about
it
.
The
same
that
he
*NL*
had
seen
in
the
crowd
that
morning
at
the
station
,
the
same
that
he
*NL*
had
surprised
in
Rogojin
's
rooms
some
hours
later
,
when
the
latter
had
*NL*
replied
to
his
inquiry
with
a
sneering
laugh
,
``
Well
,
whose
eyes
were
*NL*
they
?
''
Then
for
the
third
time
they
had
appeared
just
as
he
was
getting
*NL*
into
the
train
on
his
way
to
see
Aglaya
.
He
had
had
a
strong
impulse
to
*NL*
rush
up
to
Rogojin
,
and
repeat
his
words
of
the
morning
``
Whose
eyes
*NL*
are
they
?
''
Instead
he
had
fled
from
the
station
,
and
knew
nothing
more
,
*NL*
until
he
found
himself
gazing
into
the
window
of
a
cutler
's
shop
,
and
*NL*
wondering
if
a
knife
with
a
staghorn
handle
would
cost
more
than
sixty
*NL*
copecks
.
And
as
the
prince
sat
dreaming
in
the
Summer
Garden
under
a
*NL*
lime-tree
,
a
wicked
demon
had
come
and
whispered
in
his
car
:
``
Rogojin
*NL*
has
been
spying
upon
you
and
watching
you
all
the
morning
in
a
frenzy
*NL*
of
desperation
.
When
he
finds
you
have
not
gone
to
Pavlofsk
--
a
terrible
*NL*
discovery
for
him
--
he
will
surely
go
at
once
to
that
house
in
Petersburg
*NL*
Side
,
and
watch
for
you
there
,
although
only
this
morning
you
gave
*NL*
your
word
of
honour
not
to
see
_
her
_
,
and
swore
that
you
had
not
come
to
*NL*
Petersburg
for
that
purpose
.
''
And
thereupon
the
prince
had
hastened
off
*NL*
to
that
house
,
and
what
was
there
in
the
fact
that
he
had
met
Rogojin
*NL*
there
?
He
had
only
seen
a
wretched
,
suffering
creature
,
whose
state
of
*NL*
mind
was
gloomy
and
miserable
,
but
most
comprehensible
.
In
the
morning
*NL*
Rogojin
had
seemed
to
be
trying
to
keep
out
of
the
way
;
but
at
the
*NL*
station
this
afternoon
he
had
stood
out
,
he
had
concealed
himself
,
*NL*
indeed
,
less
than
the
prince
himself
;
at
the
house
,
now
,
he
had
stood
*NL*
fifty
yards
off
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
,
with
folded
hands
,
*NL*
watching
,
plainly
in
view
and
apparently
desirous
of
being
seen
.
He
had
*NL*
stood
there
like
an
accuser
,
like
a
judge
,
not
like
a
--
a
what
?
*NL*
*NL*
And
why
had
not
the
prince
approached
him
and
spoken
to
him
,
instead
*NL*
of
turning
away
and
pretending
he
had
seen
nothing
,
although
their
eyes
*NL*
met
?
-LRB-
Yes
,
their
eyes
had
met
,
and
they
had
looked
at
each
other
.
-RRB-
Why
,
*NL*
he
had
himself
wished
to
take
Rogojin
by
the
hand
and
go
in
together
,
he
*NL*
had
himself
determined
to
go
to
him
on
the
morrow
and
tell
him
that
he
*NL*
had
seen
her
,
he
had
repudiated
the
demon
as
he
walked
to
the
house
,
and
*NL*
his
heart
had
been
full
of
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Was
there
something
in
the
whole
aspect
of
the
man
,
today
,
sufficient
*NL*
to
justify
the
prince
's
terror
,
and
the
awful
suspicions
of
his
demon
?
*NL*
Something
seen
,
but
indescribable
,
which
filled
him
with
dreadful
*NL*
presentiments
?
Yes
,
he
was
convinced
of
it
--
convinced
of
what
?
-LRB-
Oh
,
how
*NL*
mean
and
hideous
of
him
to
feel
this
conviction
,
this
presentiment
!
How
*NL*
he
blamed
himself
for
it
!
-RRB-
``
Speak
if
you
dare
,
and
tell
me
,
what
is
the
*NL*
presentiment
?
''
he
repeated
to
himself
,
over
and
over
again
.
``
Put
it
into
*NL*
words
,
speak
out
clearly
and
distinctly
.
Oh
,
miserable
coward
that
I
*NL*
am
!
''
The
prince
flushed
with
shame
for
his
own
baseness
.
``
How
shall
I
*NL*
ever
look
this
man
in
the
face
again
?
My
God
,
what
a
day
!
And
what
a
*NL*
nightmare
,
what
a
nightmare
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
moment
,
during
this
long
,
wretched
walk
back
from
the
*NL*
Petersburg
Side
,
when
the
prince
felt
an
irresistible
desire
to
go
*NL*
straight
to
Rogojin
's
,
wait
for
him
,
embrace
him
with
tears
of
shame
and
*NL*
contrition
,
and
tell
him
of
his
distrust
,
and
finish
with
it
--
once
for
*NL*
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
here
he
was
back
at
his
hotel
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
often
during
the
day
he
had
thought
of
this
hotel
with
loathing
--
its
*NL*
corridor
,
its
rooms
,
its
stairs
.
How
he
had
dreaded
coming
back
to
it
,
*NL*
for
some
reason
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
regular
old
woman
I
am
today
,
''
he
had
said
to
himself
each
time
,
*NL*
with
annoyance
.
``
I
believe
in
every
foolish
presentiment
that
comes
into
*NL*
my
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stopped
for
a
moment
at
the
door
;
a
great
flush
of
shame
came
over
*NL*
him
.
``
I
am
a
coward
,
a
wretched
coward
,
''
he
said
,
and
moved
forward
*NL*
again
;
but
once
more
he
paused
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
all
the
incidents
of
the
day
,
one
recurred
to
his
mind
to
the
*NL*
exclusion
of
the
rest
;
although
now
that
his
self-control
was
regained
,
*NL*
and
he
was
no
longer
under
the
influence
of
a
nightmare
,
he
was
able
*NL*
to
think
of
it
calmly
.
It
concerned
the
knife
on
Rogojin
's
table
.
``
Why
*NL*
should
not
Rogojin
have
as
many
knives
on
his
table
as
he
chooses
?
''
*NL*
thought
the
prince
,
wondering
at
his
suspicions
,
as
he
had
done
when
he
*NL*
found
himself
looking
into
the
cutler
's
window
.
``
What
could
it
have
to
*NL*
do
with
me
?
''
he
said
to
himself
again
,
and
stopped
as
if
rooted
to
the
*NL*
ground
by
a
kind
of
paralysis
of
limb
such
as
attacks
people
under
the
*NL*
stress
of
some
humiliating
recollection
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doorway
was
dark
and
gloomy
at
any
time
;
but
just
at
this
moment
*NL*
it
was
rendered
doubly
so
by
the
fact
that
the
thunder-storm
had
just
*NL*
broken
,
and
the
rain
was
coming
down
in
torrents
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
in
the
semi-darkness
the
prince
distinguished
a
man
standing
close
*NL*
to
the
stairs
,
apparently
waiting
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
nothing
particularly
significant
in
the
fact
that
a
man
was
*NL*
standing
back
in
the
doorway
,
waiting
to
come
out
or
go
upstairs
;
but
*NL*
the
prince
felt
an
irresistible
conviction
that
he
knew
this
man
,
and
*NL*
that
it
was
Rogojin
.
The
man
moved
on
up
the
stairs
;
a
moment
later
the
*NL*
prince
passed
up
them
,
too
.
His
heart
froze
within
him
.
``
In
a
minute
or
*NL*
two
I
shall
know
all
,
''
he
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
staircase
led
to
the
first
and
second
corridors
of
the
hotel
,
along
*NL*
which
lay
the
guests
'
bedrooms
.
As
is
often
the
case
in
Petersburg
*NL*
houses
,
it
was
narrow
and
very
dark
,
and
turned
around
a
massive
stone
*NL*
column
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
first
landing
,
which
was
as
small
as
the
necessary
turn
of
the
*NL*
stairs
allowed
,
there
was
a
niche
in
the
column
,
about
half
a
yard
wide
,
*NL*
and
in
this
niche
the
prince
felt
convinced
that
a
man
stood
concealed
.
*NL*
He
thought
he
could
distinguish
a
figure
standing
there
.
He
would
pass
*NL*
by
quickly
and
not
look
.
He
took
a
step
forward
,
but
could
bear
the
*NL*
uncertainty
no
longer
and
turned
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
eyes
--
the
same
two
eyes
--
met
his
!
The
man
concealed
in
the
niche
had
*NL*
also
taken
a
step
forward
.
For
one
second
they
stood
face
to
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
the
prince
caught
the
man
by
the
shoulder
and
twisted
him
round
*NL*
towards
the
light
,
so
that
he
might
see
his
face
more
clearly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rogojin
's
eyes
flashed
,
and
a
smile
of
insanity
distorted
his
*NL*
countenance
.
His
right
hand
was
raised
,
and
something
glittered
in
it
.
*NL*
The
prince
did
not
think
of
trying
to
stop
it
.
All
he
could
remember
*NL*
afterwards
was
that
he
seemed
to
have
called
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Parfen
!
I
wo
n't
believe
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Next
moment
something
appeared
to
burst
open
before
him
:
a
wonderful
*NL*
inner
light
illuminated
his
soul
.
This
lasted
perhaps
half
a
second
,
yet
*NL*
he
distinctly
remembered
hearing
the
beginning
of
the
wail
,
the
strange
,
*NL*
dreadful
wail
,
which
burst
from
his
lips
of
its
own
accord
,
and
which
no
*NL*
effort
of
will
on
his
part
could
suppress
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
moment
he
was
absolutely
unconscious
;
black
darkness
blotted
out
*NL*
everything
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
fallen
in
an
epileptic
fit
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*****
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
As
is
well
known
,
these
fits
occur
instantaneously
.
The
face
,
especially
*NL*
the
eyes
,
become
terribly
disfigured
,
convulsions
seize
the
limbs
,
a
*NL*
terrible
cry
breaks
from
the
sufferer
,
a
wail
from
which
everything
*NL*
human
seems
to
be
blotted
out
,
so
that
it
is
impossible
to
believe
that
*NL*
the
man
who
has
just
fallen
is
the
same
who
emitted
the
dreadful
cry
.
*NL*
It
seems
more
as
though
some
other
being
,
inside
the
stricken
one
,
*NL*
had
cried
.
Many
people
have
borne
witness
to
this
impression
;
and
many
*NL*
can
not
behold
an
epileptic
fit
without
a
feeling
of
mysterious
terror
*NL*
and
dread
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
a
feeling
,
we
must
suppose
,
overtook
Rogojin
at
this
moment
,
and
*NL*
saved
the
prince
's
life
.
Not
knowing
that
it
was
a
fit
,
and
seeing
*NL*
his
victim
disappear
head
foremost
into
the
darkness
,
hearing
his
head
*NL*
strike
the
stone
steps
below
with
a
crash
,
Rogojin
rushed
downstairs
,
*NL*
skirting
the
body
,
and
flung
himself
headlong
out
of
the
hotel
,
like
a
*NL*
raving
madman
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
's
body
slipped
convulsively
down
the
steps
till
it
rested
at
*NL*
the
bottom
.
Very
soon
,
in
five
minutes
or
so
,
he
was
discovered
,
and
a
*NL*
crowd
collected
around
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
pool
of
blood
on
the
steps
near
his
head
gave
rise
to
grave
fears
.
Was
*NL*
it
a
case
of
accident
,
or
had
there
been
a
crime
?
It
was
,
however
,
soon
*NL*
recognized
as
a
case
of
epilepsy
,
and
identification
and
proper
measures
*NL*
for
restoration
followed
one
another
,
owing
to
a
fortunate
circumstance
.
*NL*
Colia
Ivolgin
had
come
back
to
his
hotel
about
seven
o'clock
,
owing
to
*NL*
a
sudden
impulse
which
made
him
refuse
to
dine
at
the
Epanchins
'
,
*NL*
and
,
finding
a
note
from
the
prince
awaiting
him
,
had
sped
away
to
the
*NL*
latter
's
address
.
Arrived
there
,
he
ordered
a
cup
of
tea
and
sat
sipping
*NL*
it
in
the
coffee-room
.
While
there
he
heard
excited
whispers
of
someone
*NL*
just
found
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
in
a
fit
;
upon
which
he
had
*NL*
hurried
to
the
spot
,
with
a
presentiment
of
evil
,
and
at
once
recognized
*NL*
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sufferer
was
immediately
taken
to
his
room
,
and
though
he
partially
*NL*
regained
consciousness
,
he
lay
long
in
a
semi-dazed
condition
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
stated
that
there
was
no
danger
to
be
apprehended
from
the
*NL*
wound
on
the
head
,
and
as
soon
as
the
prince
could
understand
what
*NL*
was
going
on
around
him
,
Colia
hired
a
carriage
and
took
him
away
*NL*
to
Lebedeff
's
.
There
he
was
received
with
much
cordiality
,
and
the
*NL*
departure
to
the
country
was
hastened
on
his
account
.
Three
days
later
*NL*
they
were
all
at
Pavlofsk
.
*NL*
*NL*
VI
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lebedeff
's
country-house
was
not
large
,
but
it
was
pretty
and
*NL*
convenient
,
especially
the
part
which
was
let
to
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
row
of
orange
and
lemon
trees
and
jasmines
,
planted
in
green
tubs
,
*NL*
stood
on
the
fairly
wide
terrace
.
According
to
Lebedeff
,
these
trees
*NL*
gave
the
house
a
most
delightful
aspect
.
Some
were
there
when
he
bought
*NL*
it
,
and
he
was
so
charmed
with
the
effect
that
he
promptly
added
to
*NL*
their
number
.
When
the
tubs
containing
these
plants
arrived
at
the
villa
*NL*
and
were
set
in
their
places
,
Lebedeff
kept
running
into
the
street
to
*NL*
enjoy
the
view
of
the
house
,
and
every
time
he
did
so
the
rent
to
be
*NL*
demanded
from
the
future
tenant
went
up
with
a
bound
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
country
villa
pleased
the
prince
very
much
in
his
state
of
physical
*NL*
and
mental
exhaustion
.
On
the
day
that
they
left
for
Pavlofsk
,
that
is
*NL*
the
day
after
his
attack
,
he
appeared
almost
well
,
though
in
reality
he
*NL*
felt
very
far
from
it
.
The
faces
of
those
around
him
for
the
last
three
*NL*
days
had
made
a
pleasant
impression
.
He
was
pleased
to
see
,
not
only
*NL*
Colia
,
who
had
become
his
inseparable
companion
,
but
Lebedeff
himself
*NL*
and
all
the
family
,
except
the
nephew
,
who
had
left
the
house
.
He
was
*NL*
also
glad
to
receive
a
visit
from
General
Ivolgin
,
before
leaving
St.
*NL*
Petersburg
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
getting
late
when
the
party
arrived
at
Pavlofsk
,
but
several
*NL*
people
called
to
see
the
prince
,
and
assembled
in
the
verandah
.
Gania
*NL*
was
the
first
to
arrive
.
He
had
grown
so
pale
and
thin
that
the
prince
*NL*
could
hardly
recognize
him
.
Then
came
Varia
and
Ptitsin
,
who
were
*NL*
rusticating
in
the
neighbourhood
.
As
to
General
Ivolgin
,
he
scarcely
*NL*
budged
from
Lebedeff
's
house
,
and
seemed
to
have
moved
to
Pavlofsk
with
*NL*
him
.
Lebedeff
did
his
best
to
keep
Ardalion
Alexandrovitch
by
him
,
and
*NL*
to
prevent
him
from
invading
the
prince
's
quarters
.
He
chatted
with
*NL*
him
confidentially
,
so
that
they
might
have
been
taken
for
old
friends
.
*NL*
During
those
three
days
the
prince
had
noticed
that
they
frequently
held
*NL*
long
conversations
;
he
often
heard
their
voices
raised
in
argument
on
*NL*
deep
and
learned
subjects
,
which
evidently
pleased
Lebedeff
.
He
seemed
*NL*
as
if
he
could
not
do
without
the
general
.
But
it
was
not
only
Ardalion
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
whom
Lebedeff
kept
out
of
the
prince
's
way
.
Since
they
*NL*
had
come
to
the
villa
,
he
treated
his
own
family
the
same
.
Upon
the
*NL*
pretext
that
his
tenant
needed
quiet
,
he
kept
him
almost
in
isolation
,
*NL*
and
Muishkin
protested
in
vain
against
this
excess
of
zeal
.
Lebedeff
*NL*
stamped
his
feet
at
his
daughters
and
drove
them
away
if
they
attempted
*NL*
to
join
the
prince
on
the
terrace
;
not
even
Vera
was
excepted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
will
lose
all
respect
if
they
are
allowed
to
be
so
free
and
easy
;
*NL*
besides
it
is
not
proper
for
them
,
''
he
declared
at
last
,
in
answer
to
a
*NL*
direct
question
from
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
on
earth
not
?
''
asked
the
latter
.
``
Really
,
you
know
,
you
are
making
*NL*
yourself
a
nuisance
,
by
keeping
guard
over
me
like
this
.
I
get
bored
*NL*
all
by
myself
;
I
have
told
you
so
over
and
over
again
,
and
you
get
on
*NL*
my
nerves
more
than
ever
by
waving
your
hands
and
creeping
in
and
out
in
*NL*
the
mysterious
way
you
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
fact
that
Lebedeff
,
though
he
was
so
anxious
to
keep
everyone
*NL*
else
from
disturbing
the
patient
,
was
continually
in
and
out
of
the
*NL*
prince
's
room
himself
.
He
invariably
began
by
opening
the
door
a
crack
*NL*
and
peering
in
to
see
if
the
prince
was
there
,
or
if
he
had
escaped
;
*NL*
then
he
would
creep
softly
up
to
the
arm-chair
,
sometimes
making
*NL*
Muishkin
jump
by
his
sudden
appearance
.
He
always
asked
if
the
patient
*NL*
wanted
anything
,
and
when
the
latter
replied
that
he
only
wanted
to
be
*NL*
left
in
peace
,
he
would
turn
away
obediently
and
make
for
the
door
on
*NL*
tip-toe
,
with
deprecatory
gestures
to
imply
that
he
had
only
just
looked
*NL*
in
,
that
he
would
not
speak
a
word
,
and
would
go
away
and
not
intrude
*NL*
again
;
which
did
not
prevent
him
from
reappearing
in
ten
minutes
or
*NL*
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
Colia
had
free
access
to
the
prince
,
at
which
*NL*
Lebedeff
was
quite
disgusted
and
indignant
.
He
would
listen
at
the
door
*NL*
for
half
an
hour
at
a
time
while
the
two
were
talking
.
Colia
found
this
*NL*
out
,
and
naturally
told
the
prince
of
his
discovery
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
yourself
my
master
,
that
you
try
to
keep
me
under
lock
and
*NL*
key
like
this
?
''
said
the
prince
to
Lebedeff
.
``
In
the
country
,
at
least
,
*NL*
I
intend
to
be
free
,
and
you
may
make
up
your
mind
that
I
mean
to
see
*NL*
whom
I
like
,
and
go
where
I
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
of
course
,
''
replied
the
clerk
,
gesticulating
with
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
looked
him
sternly
up
and
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Lukian
Timofeyovitch
,
have
you
brought
the
little
cupboard
that
*NL*
you
had
at
the
head
of
your
bed
with
you
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
left
it
where
it
was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Impossible
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
can
not
be
moved
;
you
would
have
to
pull
the
wall
down
,
it
is
so
*NL*
firmly
fixed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
you
have
one
like
it
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
one
that
is
even
better
,
much
better
;
that
is
really
why
I
*NL*
bought
this
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
What
visitor
did
you
turn
away
from
my
door
,
about
an
hour
ago
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The-the
general
.
I
would
not
let
him
in
;
there
is
no
need
for
him
to
*NL*
visit
you
,
prince
...
I
have
the
deepest
esteem
for
him
,
he
is
a
--
a
great
*NL*
man
.
You
do
n't
believe
it
?
Well
,
you
will
see
,
and
yet
,
most
excellent
*NL*
prince
,
you
had
much
better
not
receive
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
ask
why
?
and
also
why
you
walk
about
on
tiptoe
and
always
seem
as
*NL*
if
you
were
going
to
whisper
a
secret
in
my
ear
whenever
you
come
near
*NL*
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
vile
,
vile
;
I
know
it
!
''
cried
Lebedeff
,
beating
his
breast
with
a
*NL*
contrite
air
.
``
But
will
not
the
general
be
too
hospitable
for
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Too
hospitable
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
First
,
he
proposes
to
come
and
live
in
my
house
.
Well
and
good
;
*NL*
but
he
sticks
at
nothing
;
he
immediately
makes
himself
one
of
the
*NL*
family
.
We
have
talked
over
our
respective
relations
several
times
,
and
*NL*
discovered
that
we
are
connected
by
marriage
.
It
seems
also
that
you
are
*NL*
a
sort
of
nephew
on
his
mother
's
side
;
he
was
explaining
it
to
me
again
*NL*
only
yesterday
.
If
you
are
his
nephew
,
it
follows
that
I
must
also
be
a
*NL*
relation
of
yours
,
most
excellent
prince
.
Never
mind
about
that
,
it
is
*NL*
only
a
foible
;
but
just
now
he
assured
me
that
all
his
life
,
from
the
*NL*
day
he
was
made
an
ensign
to
the
11th
of
last
June
,
he
has
entertained
*NL*
at
least
two
hundred
guests
at
his
table
every
day
.
Finally
,
he
went
so
*NL*
far
as
to
say
that
they
never
rose
from
the
table
;
they
dined
,
supped
,
*NL*
and
had
tea
,
for
fifteen
hours
at
a
stretch
.
This
went
on
for
thirty
*NL*
years
without
a
break
;
there
was
barely
time
to
change
the
table-cloth
;
*NL*
directly
one
person
left
,
another
took
his
place
.
On
feast-days
he
*NL*
entertained
as
many
as
three
hundred
guests
,
and
they
numbered
seven
*NL*
hundred
on
the
thousandth
anniversary
of
the
foundation
of
the
Russian
*NL*
Empire
.
It
amounts
to
a
passion
with
him
;
it
makes
one
uneasy
to
hear
of
*NL*
it
.
It
is
terrible
to
have
to
entertain
people
who
do
things
on
such
a
*NL*
scale
.
That
is
why
I
wonder
whether
such
a
man
is
not
too
hospitable
for
*NL*
you
and
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
seem
to
be
on
the
best
of
terms
with
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
fraternal
--
I
look
upon
it
as
a
joke
.
Let
us
be
brothers-in-law
,
*NL*
it
is
all
the
same
to
me
,
--
rather
an
honour
than
not
.
But
in
spite
of
*NL*
the
two
hundred
guests
and
the
thousandth
anniversary
of
the
Russian
*NL*
Empire
,
I
can
see
that
he
is
a
very
remarkable
man
.
I
am
quite
sincere
.
*NL*
You
said
just
now
that
I
always
looked
as
if
I
was
going
to
tell
you
a
*NL*
secret
;
you
are
right
.
I
have
a
secret
to
tell
you
:
a
certain
person
has
*NL*
just
let
me
know
that
she
is
very
anxious
for
a
secret
interview
with
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
it
be
secret
?
Not
at
all
;
I
will
call
on
her
myself
*NL*
tomorrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
oh
no
!
''
cried
Lebedeff
,
waving
his
arms
;
``
if
she
is
afraid
,
it
is
*NL*
not
for
the
reason
you
think
.
By
the
way
,
do
you
know
that
the
monster
*NL*
comes
every
day
to
inquire
after
your
health
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
call
him
a
monster
so
often
that
it
makes
me
suspicious
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
have
no
suspicions
,
none
whatever
,
''
said
Lebedeff
quickly
.
``
I
*NL*
only
want
you
to
know
that
the
person
in
question
is
not
afraid
of
him
,
*NL*
but
of
something
quite
,
quite
different
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
on
earth
is
she
afraid
of
,
then
?
Tell
me
plainly
,
without
any
more
*NL*
beating
about
the
bush
,
''
said
the
prince
,
exasperated
by
the
other
's
*NL*
mysterious
grimaces
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
that
is
the
secret
,
''
said
Lebedeff
,
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whose
secret
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yours
.
You
forbade
me
yourself
to
mention
it
before
you
,
most
excellent
*NL*
prince
,
''
murmured
Lebedeff
.
Then
,
satisfied
that
he
had
worked
up
*NL*
Muishkin
's
curiosity
to
the
highest
pitch
,
he
added
abruptly
:
``
She
is
*NL*
afraid
of
Aglaya
Ivanovna
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
frowned
for
a
moment
in
silence
,
and
then
said
suddenly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
,
Lebedeff
,
I
must
leave
your
house
.
Where
are
Gavrila
*NL*
Ardalionovitch
and
the
Ptitsins
?
Are
they
here
?
Have
you
chased
them
*NL*
away
,
too
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
coming
,
they
are
coming
;
and
the
general
as
well
.
I
will
open
*NL*
all
the
doors
;
I
will
call
all
my
daughters
,
all
of
them
,
this
very
*NL*
minute
,
''
said
Lebedeff
in
a
low
voice
,
thoroughly
frightened
,
and
waving
*NL*
his
hands
as
he
ran
from
door
to
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
Colia
appeared
on
the
terrace
;
he
announced
that
*NL*
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
and
her
three
daughters
were
close
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moved
by
this
news
,
Lebedeff
hurried
up
to
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
call
the
Ptitsins
,
and
Gavrila
Ardalionovitch
?
Shall
I
let
the
*NL*
general
in
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
Let
in
anyone
who
wants
to
see
me
.
I
assure
you
,
Lebedeff
,
you
*NL*
have
misunderstood
my
position
from
the
very
first
;
you
have
been
wrong
*NL*
all
along
.
I
have
not
the
slightest
reason
to
hide
myself
from
anyone
,
''
*NL*
replied
the
prince
gaily
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seeing
him
laugh
,
Lebedeff
thought
fit
to
laugh
also
,
and
though
much
*NL*
agitated
his
satisfaction
was
quite
visible
.
*NL*
*NL*
Colia
was
right
;
the
Epanchin
ladies
were
only
a
few
steps
behind
him
.
*NL*
As
they
approached
the
terrace
other
visitors
appeared
from
Lebedeff
's
*NL*
side
of
the
house-the
Ptitsins
,
Gania
,
and
Ardalion
Alexandrovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Epanchins
had
only
just
heard
of
the
prince
's
illness
and
of
his
*NL*
presence
in
Pavlofsk
,
from
Colia
;
and
up
to
this
time
had
been
in
a
*NL*
state
of
considerable
bewilderment
about
him
.
The
general
brought
the
*NL*
prince
's
card
down
from
town
,
and
Mrs.
Epanchin
had
felt
convinced
that
*NL*
he
himself
would
follow
his
card
at
once
;
she
was
much
excited
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
vain
the
girls
assured
her
that
a
man
who
had
not
written
for
six
*NL*
months
would
not
be
in
such
a
dreadful
hurry
,
and
that
probably
he
had
*NL*
enough
to
do
in
town
without
needing
to
bustle
down
to
Pavlofsk
to
see
*NL*
them
.
Their
mother
was
quite
angry
at
the
very
idea
of
such
a
thing
,
and
*NL*
announced
her
absolute
conviction
that
he
would
turn
up
the
next
day
at
*NL*
latest
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
next
day
the
prince
was
expected
all
the
morning
,
and
at
dinner
,
tea
,
*NL*
and
supper
;
and
when
he
did
not
appear
in
the
evening
,
Mrs.
Epanchin
*NL*
quarrelled
with
everyone
in
the
house
,
finding
plenty
of
pretexts
*NL*
without
so
much
as
mentioning
the
prince
's
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
third
day
there
was
no
talk
of
him
at
all
,
until
Aglaya
remarked
*NL*
at
dinner
:
``
Mamma
is
cross
because
the
prince
has
n't
turned
up
,
''
to
*NL*
which
the
general
replied
that
it
was
not
his
fault
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Epanchin
misunderstood
the
observation
,
and
rising
from
her
place
*NL*
she
left
the
room
in
majestic
wrath
.
In
the
evening
,
however
,
Colia
came
*NL*
with
the
story
of
the
prince
's
adventures
,
so
far
as
he
knew
them
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Epanchin
was
triumphant
;
although
Colia
had
to
listen
to
a
long
lecture
.
*NL*
``
He
idles
about
here
the
whole
day
long
,
one
ca
n't
get
rid
of
him
;
and
*NL*
then
when
he
is
wanted
he
does
not
come
.
He
might
have
sent
a
line
if
he
*NL*
did
not
wish
to
inconvenience
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
words
``
one
ca
n't
get
rid
of
him
,
''
Colia
was
very
angry
,
and
*NL*
nearly
flew
into
a
rage
;
but
he
resolved
to
be
quiet
for
the
time
and
*NL*
show
his
resentment
later
.
If
the
words
had
been
less
offensive
he
*NL*
might
have
forgiven
them
,
so
pleased
was
he
to
see
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
*NL*
worried
and
anxious
about
the
prince
's
illness
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
would
have
insisted
on
sending
to
Petersburg
at
once
,
for
a
certain
*NL*
great
medical
celebrity
;
but
her
daughters
dissuaded
her
,
though
they
*NL*
were
not
willing
to
stay
behind
when
she
at
once
prepared
to
go
and
*NL*
visit
the
invalid
.
Aglaya
,
however
,
suggested
that
it
was
a
little
*NL*
unceremonious
to
go
_
en
masse
_
to
see
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
then
,
stay
at
home
,
''
said
Mrs.
Epanchin
,
``
and
a
good
thing
*NL*
too
,
for
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
is
coming
down
and
there
will
be
no
one
at
*NL*
home
to
receive
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
,
after
this
,
Aglaya
went
with
the
rest
.
In
fact
,
she
had
never
*NL*
had
the
slightest
intention
of
doing
otherwise
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
S.
,
who
was
in
the
house
,
was
requested
to
escort
the
ladies
.
*NL*
He
had
been
much
interested
when
he
first
heard
of
the
prince
from
the
*NL*
Epanchins
.
It
appeared
that
they
had
known
one
another
before
,
and
had
*NL*
spent
some
time
together
in
a
little
provincial
town
three
months
*NL*
ago
.
Prince
S.
had
greatly
taken
to
him
,
and
was
delighted
with
the
*NL*
opportunity
of
meeting
him
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
general
had
not
come
down
from
town
as
yet
,
nor
had
Evgenie
*NL*
Pavlovitch
arrived
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
more
than
two
or
three
hundred
yards
from
the
Epanchins
'
*NL*
house
to
Lebedeff
's
.
The
first
disagreeable
impression
experienced
by
*NL*
Mrs.
Epanchin
was
to
find
the
prince
surrounded
by
a
whole
assembly
of
*NL*
other
guests
--
not
to
mention
the
fact
that
some
of
those
present
were
*NL*
particularly
detestable
in
her
eyes
.
The
next
annoying
circumstance
was
*NL*
when
an
apparently
strong
and
healthy
young
fellow
,
well
dressed
,
*NL*
and
smiling
,
came
forward
to
meet
her
on
the
terrace
,
instead
of
the
*NL*
half-dying
unfortunate
whom
she
had
expected
to
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
astonished
and
vexed
,
and
her
disappointment
pleased
Colia
*NL*
immensely
.
Of
course
he
could
have
undeceived
her
before
she
started
,
*NL*
but
the
mischievous
boy
had
been
careful
not
to
do
that
,
foreseeing
the
*NL*
probably
laughable
disgust
that
she
would
experience
when
she
found
her
*NL*
dear
friend
,
the
prince
,
in
good
health
.
Colia
was
indelicate
enough
to
*NL*
voice
the
delight
he
felt
at
his
success
in
managing
to
annoy
Lizabetha
*NL*
Prokofievna
,
with
whom
,
in
spite
of
their
really
amicable
relations
,
he
*NL*
was
constantly
sparring
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
wait
a
while
,
my
boy
!
''
said
she
;
``
do
n't
be
too
certain
of
your
*NL*
triumph
.
''
And
she
sat
down
heavily
,
in
the
arm-chair
pushed
forward
by
*NL*
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lebedeff
,
Ptitsin
,
and
General
Ivolgin
hastened
to
find
chairs
for
*NL*
the
young
ladies
.
Varia
greeted
them
joyfully
,
and
they
exchanged
*NL*
confidences
in
ecstatic
whispers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
admit
,
prince
,
I
was
a
little
put
out
to
see
you
up
and
about
*NL*
like
this
--
I
expected
to
find
you
in
bed
;
but
I
give
you
my
word
,
I
was
*NL*
only
annoyed
for
an
instant
,
before
I
collected
my
thoughts
properly
.
I
*NL*
am
always
wiser
on
second
thoughts
,
and
I
dare
say
you
are
the
same
.
*NL*
I
assure
you
I
am
as
glad
to
see
you
well
as
though
you
were
my
own
*NL*
son
,
--
yes
,
and
more
;
and
if
you
do
n't
believe
me
the
more
shame
to
you
,
*NL*
and
it
's
not
my
fault
.
But
that
spiteful
boy
delights
in
playing
all
*NL*
sorts
of
tricks
.
You
are
his
patron
,
it
seems
.
Well
,
I
warn
you
that
*NL*
one
fine
morning
I
shall
deprive
myself
of
the
pleasure
of
his
further
*NL*
acquaintance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
I
done
wrong
now
?
''
cried
Colia
.
``
What
was
the
good
of
telling
*NL*
you
that
the
prince
was
nearly
well
again
?
You
would
not
have
believed
*NL*
me
;
it
was
so
much
more
interesting
to
picture
him
on
his
death-bed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
long
do
you
remain
here
,
prince
?
''
asked
Madame
Epanchin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
the
summer
,
and
perhaps
longer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
alone
,
are
n't
you
,
--
not
married
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
'm
not
married
!
''
replied
the
prince
,
smiling
at
the
ingenuousness
*NL*
of
this
little
feeler
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
need
n't
laugh
!
These
things
do
happen
,
you
know
!
Now
then
--
why
*NL*
did
n't
you
come
to
us
?
We
have
a
wing
quite
empty
.
But
just
as
you
like
,
*NL*
of
course
.
Do
you
lease
it
from
_
him
?
_
--
this
fellow
,
I
mean
,
''
she
added
,
*NL*
nodding
towards
Lebedeff
.
``
And
why
does
he
always
wriggle
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
Vera
,
carrying
the
baby
in
her
arms
as
usual
,
came
out
of
*NL*
the
house
,
on
to
the
terrace
.
Lebedeff
kept
fidgeting
among
the
chairs
,
*NL*
and
did
not
seem
to
know
what
to
do
with
himself
,
though
he
had
no
*NL*
intention
of
going
away
.
He
no
sooner
caught
sight
of
his
daughter
,
than
*NL*
he
rushed
in
her
direction
,
waving
his
arms
to
keep
her
away
;
he
even
*NL*
forgot
himself
so
far
as
to
stamp
his
foot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
mad
?
''
asked
Madame
Epanchin
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
he
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
he
is
drunk
?
Your
company
is
rather
peculiar
,
''
she
added
,
with
*NL*
a
glance
at
the
other
guests
...
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
a
pretty
girl
!
Who
is
she
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
Lebedeff
's
daughter
--
Vera
Lukianovna
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
?
She
looks
very
sweet
.
I
should
like
to
make
her
acquaintance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
words
were
hardly
out
of
her
mouth
,
when
Lebedeff
dragged
Vera
*NL*
forward
,
in
order
to
present
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Orphans
,
poor
orphans
!
''
he
began
in
a
pathetic
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
child
she
carries
is
an
orphan
,
too
.
She
is
Vera
's
sister
,
my
*NL*
daughter
Luboff
.
The
day
this
babe
was
born
,
six
weeks
ago
,
my
wife
*NL*
died
,
by
the
will
of
God
Almighty
...
Yes
...
Vera
takes
her
mother
's
*NL*
place
,
though
she
is
but
her
sister

nothing
more
...
nothing
more
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
!
You
are
nothing
more
than
a
fool
,
if
you
'll
excuse
me
!
Well
!
*NL*
well
!
you
know
that
yourself
,
I
expect
,
''
said
the
lady
indignantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lebedeff
bowed
low
.
``
It
is
the
truth
,
''
he
replied
,
with
extreme
respect
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Mr.
Lebedeff
,
I
am
told
you
lecture
on
the
Apocalypse
.
Is
it
true
?
''
*NL*
asked
Aglaya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
is
so
...
for
the
last
fifteen
years
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
heard
of
you
,
and
I
think
read
of
you
in
the
newspapers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
that
was
another
commentator
,
whom
the
papers
named
.
He
is
dead
,
*NL*
however
,
and
I
have
taken
his
place
,
''
said
the
other
,
much
delighted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
neighbours
,
so
will
you
be
so
kind
as
to
come
over
one
day
and
*NL*
explain
the
Apocalypse
to
me
?
''
said
Aglaya
.
``
I
do
not
understand
it
in
*NL*
the
least
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Allow
me
to
warn
you
,
''
interposed
General
Ivolgin
,
``
that
he
is
the
*NL*
greatest
charlatan
on
earth
.
''
He
had
taken
the
chair
next
to
the
girl
,
*NL*
and
was
impatient
to
begin
talking
.
``
No
doubt
there
are
pleasures
and
*NL*
amusements
peculiar
to
the
country
,
''
he
continued
,
``
and
to
listen
to
a
*NL*
pretended
student
holding
forth
on
the
book
of
the
Revelations
may
be
*NL*
as
good
as
any
other
.
It
may
even
be
original
.
But
...
you
seem
to
*NL*
be
looking
at
me
with
some
surprise
--
may
I
introduce
myself
--
General
*NL*
Ivolgin
--
I
carried
you
in
my
arms
as
a
baby

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Delighted
,
I
'm
sure
,
''
said
Aglaya
;
``
I
am
acquainted
with
Varvara
*NL*
Ardalionovna
and
Nina
Alexandrovna
.
''
She
was
trying
hard
to
restrain
*NL*
herself
from
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Epanchin
flushed
up
;
some
accumulation
of
spleen
in
her
suddenly
*NL*
needed
an
outlet
.
She
could
not
bear
this
General
Ivolgin
whom
she
had
*NL*
once
known
,
long
ago
--
in
society
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
deviating
from
the
truth
,
sir
,
as
usual
!
''
she
remarked
,
boiling
*NL*
over
with
indignation
;
``
you
never
carried
her
in
your
life
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
forgotten
,
mother
,
''
said
Aglaya
,
suddenly
.
``
He
really
did
*NL*
carry
me
about

in
Tver

you
know

I
was
six
years
old
,
I
remember
.
*NL*
He
made
me
a
bow
and
arrow
,
and
I
shot
a
pigeon
.
Do
n't
you
remember
*NL*
shooting
a
pigeon
,
you
and
I
,
one
day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

he
made
me
a
cardboard
helmet

a
little
wooden
sword

I

remember

said
Adelaida
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
remember
too
!
''
said
Alexandra
.
``
You
quarrelled
about
the
wounded
*NL*
pigeon

Adelaida
was
put
in
the
corner

and
stood
there
with
her
*NL*
helmet
and
sword
and
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
general
had
merely
made
the
remark
about
having
carried
Aglaya
*NL*
in
his
arms
because
he
always
did
so
begin
a
conversation
with
young
*NL*
people
.
But
it
happened
that
this
time
he
had
really
hit
upon
the
truth
,
*NL*
though
he
had
himself
entirely
forgotten
the
fact
.
But
when
Adelaida
and
*NL*
Aglaya
recalled
the
episode
of
the
pigeon
,
his
mind
became
filled
*NL*
with
memories
,
and
it
is
impossible
to
describe
how
this
poor
old
man
,
*NL*
usually
half
drunk
,
was
moved
by
the
recollection
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
remember

I
remember
it
all

he
cried
.
``
I
was
captain
then

such
a
lovely
little

I
was

received
then
by
General
Epanchin

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

look
what
you

come
to

interrupted
Mrs.
Epanchin
.
*NL*
``
However

I

you

away

you

instead
of
looking
after

you

spent
your

There
's
nothing
so
favourable
for
repentance
as
to
think
of
the
*NL*
past
with
feelings
of
remorse
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
need
to
repeat
that
she
was
serious
.
The
general
,
like
all
*NL*
drunkards
,
was
extremely
emotional
and
easily
touched
by
recollections
*NL*
of
his
better
days
.
He
rose
and
walked
quietly
to
the
door
,
so
meekly
*NL*
that
Mrs.
Epanchin
was
instantly
sorry
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ardalion
Alexandrovitch
,
''
she
cried
after
him
,
``
wait
a
moment
,
we
are
*NL*
all
sinners
!
When
you
feel
that
your
conscience
reproaches
you
a
little
*NL*
less
,
come
over
to
me
and
we
'll
have
a
talk
about
the
past
!
I
dare
say
I
*NL*
am
fifty
times
more
of
a
sinner
than
you
are
!
And
now
go
,
go
,
good-bye
,
*NL*
you
had
better
not
stay
here
!
''
she
added
,
in
alarm
,
as
he
turned
as
*NL*
though
to
come
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
go
after
him
just
now
,
Colia
,
or
he
'll
be
vexed
,
and
the
benefit
*NL*
of
this
moment
will
be
lost
!
''
said
the
prince
,
as
the
boy
was
hurrying
*NL*
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
true
!
Much
better
to
go
in
half
an
hour
or
so
,
said
Mrs.
Epanchin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
what
comes
of
telling
the
truth
for
once
in
one
's
life
!
''
said
*NL*
Lebedeff
.
``
It
reduced
him
to
tears
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
come
!
the
less
_
you
_
say
about
it
the
better
--
to
judge
from
all
I
*NL*
have
heard
about
you
!
''
replied
Mrs.
Epanchin
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
took
the
first
opportunity
of
informing
the
Epanchin
ladies
*NL*
that
he
had
intended
to
pay
them
a
visit
that
day
,
if
they
had
not
*NL*
themselves
come
this
afternoon
,
and
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
replied
that
*NL*
she
hoped
he
would
still
do
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
some
of
the
visitors
had
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ptitsin
had
tactfully
retreated
to
Lebedeff
's
wing
;
and
Gania
soon
*NL*
followed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
had
behaved
modestly
,
but
with
dignity
,
on
this
occasion
*NL*
of
his
first
meeting
with
the
Epanchins
since
the
rupture
.
Twice
Mrs.
*NL*
Epanchin
had
deliberately
examined
him
from
head
to
foot
;
but
he
had
*NL*
stood
fire
without
flinching
.
He
was
certainly
much
changed
,
as
anyone
*NL*
could
see
who
had
not
met
him
for
some
time
;
and
this
fact
seemed
to
*NL*
afford
Aglaya
a
good
deal
of
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
Gavrila
Ardalionovitch
,
who
just
went
out
,
was
n't
it
?
''
she
*NL*
asked
suddenly
,
interrupting
somebody
else
's
conversation
to
make
the
*NL*
remark
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
was
,
''
said
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hardly
knew
him
;
he
is
much
changed

and
for
the
better

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
glad
,
''
said
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
been
very
ill
,
''
added
Varia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
has
he
changed
for

better

''
asked
Mrs.
Epanchin
.
``
I
do
n't
see
*NL*
any
change

What
's
better
in
him

Where
did
you
get

that

*NL*
idea
from

What
's

better
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
nothing
better
than
the
`
poor
knight

said
Colia
,
who
was
*NL*
standing
near
the
last
speaker
's
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
quite
agree
with
you
there
!
''
said
Prince
S.
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
do
I
,
''
said
Adelaida
,
solemnly
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
What
_
poor
knight
?
''
asked
Mrs.
Epanchin
,
looking
round
at
the
face
of
*NL*
each
of
the
speakers
in
turn
.
Seeing
,
however
,
that
Aglaya
was
blushing
,
*NL*
she
added
,
angrily
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
nonsense
you
are
all
talking
!
What
do
you
mean
by
poor
knight
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
the
first
time
this
urchin

your
favourite
,
has
shown
his
*NL*
impudence
by
twisting
other
people
's
words
,

said
Aglaya
,
haughtily
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
time
that
Aglaya
showed
temper
-LRB-
and
this
was
very
often
-RRB-
,
there
*NL*
was
so
much
childish
pouting
,
such
``
school-girlishness
,
''
as
it
were
,
in
*NL*
her
apparent
wrath
,
that
it
was
impossible
to
avoid
smiling
at
her
,
to
*NL*
her
own
unutterable
indignation
.
On
these
occasions
she
would
say
,
``
How
*NL*
can
they
,
how
_
dare
_
they
laugh
at
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
time
everyone
laughed
at
her
,
her
sisters
,
Prince
S.
,
Prince
*NL*
Muishkin
-LRB-
though
he
himself
had
flushed
for
some
reason
-RRB-
,
and
Colia
.
*NL*
Aglaya
was
dreadfully
indignant
,
and
looked
twice
as
pretty
in
her
*NL*
wrath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
always
twisting
round
what
one
says
,
''
she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
only
repeating
your
own
exclamation

''
said
Colia
.
``
A
month
ago
you
*NL*
were
turning
over
the
pages
of
your
Don

suddenly
called
out
*NL*
`
there
is
nothing
better
than
the
poor
knight

I
do
n't
know
whom
*NL*
you
were
referring
to

of
course
,
whether
to
Don
Quixote
,
or
Evgenie
*NL*
Pavlovitch
,
or
someone
else
,
but
you
certainly
said
these
words
,
and
*NL*
afterwards
there
was
a
long
conversation
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
inclined
to
go
a
little
too
far
,
my
good
boy
,
with
your
*NL*
guesses

said
Mrs.
Epanchin
,
with
some
show
of
annoyance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
's
not
I
alone
,
''
cried
Colia
.
``
They
all
talked
about
it

they
*NL*
do
still

Why
,
just
now
Prince
S.
and
Adelaida
Ivanovna
declared
that
*NL*
they
upheld
`
the
poor
knight
'
;
so
evidently
there
does
exist
a
`
poor
*NL*
knight
'
;
and
if
it
were
not
for
Adelaida
Ivanovna
,
we
should
have
known
*NL*
long
ago
who
the
`
poor
knight

was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
how
am
I
to
blame
?
''
asked
Adelaida
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
n't
draw
his
portrait
for
us
,
that
's
why
you
are
to
blame
!
*NL*
Aglaya
Ivanovna
asked
you
to
draw
his
portrait
,
and
gave
you
the
whole
*NL*
subject
of
the
picture
.
She
invented
it
herself
;
and
you
would
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
was
I
to
draw
?
According
to
the
lines
she
quoted
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
From
his
face
he
never
lifted
*NL*
That
eternal
mask
of
steel
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
sort
of
a
face
was
I
to
draw
?
I
could
n't
draw
a
mask
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
you
are
driving
at
;
what
mask
do
you
mean
?
''
said
*NL*
Mrs.
Epanchin
,
irritably
.
She
began
to
see
pretty
clearly
though
what
*NL*
it
meant
,
and
whom
they
referred
to
by
the
generally
accepted
title
of
*NL*
``
poor
knight
.
''
But
what
specially
annoyed
her
was
that
the
prince
was
*NL*
looking
so
uncomfortable
,
and
blushing
like
a
ten-year-old
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
have
you
finished
your
silly
joke
?
''
she
added
,
``
and
am
I
to
be
*NL*
told
what
this
`
poor
knight
'
means
,
or
is
it
a
solemn
secret
which
*NL*
can
not
be
approached
lightly
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
they
all
laughed
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
simply
that
there
is
a
Russian
poem
,
''
began
Prince
S.
,
evidently
*NL*
anxious
to
change
the
conversation
,
``
a
strange
thing
,
without
beginning
*NL*
or
end
,
and
all
about
a
`
poor
knight
.
'
A
month
or
so
ago
,
we
were
all
*NL*
talking
and
laughing
,
and
looking
up
a
subject
for
one
of
Adelaida
's
*NL*
pictures
--
you
know
it
is
the
principal
business
of
this
family
to
find
*NL*
subjects
for
Adelaida
's
pictures
.
Well
,
we
happened
upon
this
`
poor
*NL*
knight
.
'
I
do
n't
remember
who
thought
of
it
first
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Aglaya
Ivanovna
did
,
''
said
Colia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
likely
--
I
do
n't
recollect
,
''
continued
Prince
S.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
of
us
laughed
at
the
subject
;
some
liked
it
;
but
she
declared
*NL*
that
,
in
order
to
make
a
picture
of
the
gentleman
,
she
must
first
see
*NL*
his
face
.
We
then
began
to
think
over
all
our
friends
'
faces
to
see
*NL*
if
any
of
them
would
do
,
and
none
suited
us
,
and
so
the
matter
stood
;
*NL*
that
's
all
.
I
do
n't
know
why
Nicolai
Ardalionovitch
has
brought
up
*NL*
the
joke
now
.
What
was
appropriate
and
funny
then
,
has
quite
lost
all
*NL*
interest
by
this
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Probably
there
's
some
new
silliness
about
it
,
''
said
Mrs.
Epanchin
,
*NL*
sarcastically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
silliness
about
it
at
all
--
only
the
profoundest
respect
,
''
*NL*
said
Aglaya
,
very
seriously
.
She
had
quite
recovered
her
temper
;
in
*NL*
fact
,
from
certain
signs
,
it
was
fair
to
conclude
that
she
was
delighted
*NL*
to
see
this
joke
going
so
far
;
and
a
careful
observer
might
have
*NL*
remarked
that
her
satisfaction
dated
from
the
moment
when
the
fact
of
*NL*
the
prince
's
confusion
became
apparent
to
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Profoundest
respect
!
'
What
nonsense
!
First
,
insane
giggling
,
and
then
,
*NL*
all
of
a
sudden
,
a
display
of
`
profoundest
respect
.
'
Why
respect
?
Tell
*NL*
me
at
once
,
why
have
you
suddenly
developed
this
`
profound
respect
,
'
*NL*
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
,
''
replied
Aglaya
gravely
,
``
in
the
poem
the
knight
is
described
*NL*
as
a
man
capable
of
living
up
to
an
ideal
all
his
life
.
That
sort
of
*NL*
thing
is
not
to
be
found
every
day
among
the
men
of
our
times
.
In
the
*NL*
poem
it
is
not
stated
exactly
what
the
ideal
was
,
but
it
was
evidently
*NL*
some
vision
,
some
revelation
of
pure
Beauty
,
and
the
knight
wore
round
*NL*
his
neck
,
instead
of
a
scarf
,
a
rosary
.
A
device
--
A.
N.
B.
--
the
meaning
*NL*
of
which
is
not
explained
,
was
inscribed
on
his
shield
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
A.
N.
D.
,
''
corrected
Colia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
A.
N.
B.
,
and
so
it
shall
be
!
''
cried
Aglaya
,
irritably
.
``
Anyway
,
*NL*
the
`
poor
knight
'
did
not
care
what
his
lady
was
,
or
what
she
did
.
He
*NL*
had
chosen
his
ideal
,
and
he
was
bound
to
serve
her
,
and
break
lances
*NL*
for
her
,
and
acknowledge
her
as
the
ideal
of
pure
Beauty
,
whatever
she
*NL*
might
say
or
do
afterwards
.
If
she
had
taken
to
stealing
,
he
would
have
*NL*
championed
her
just
the
same
.
I
think
the
poet
desired
to
embody
in
this
*NL*
one
picture
the
whole
spirit
of
medieval
chivalry
and
the
platonic
love
*NL*
of
a
pure
and
high-souled
knight
.
Of
course
it
's
all
an
ideal
,
and
in
*NL*
the
`
poor
knight
'
that
spirit
reached
the
utmost
limit
of
asceticism
.
He
*NL*
is
a
Don
Quixote
,
only
serious
and
not
comical
.
I
used
not
to
understand
*NL*
him
,
and
laughed
at
him
,
but
now
I
love
the
`
poor
knight
,
'
and
respect
*NL*
his
actions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
ended
Aglaya
;
and
,
to
look
at
her
,
it
was
difficult
,
indeed
,
to
judge
*NL*
whether
she
was
joking
or
in
earnest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pooh
!
he
was
a
fool
,
and
his
actions
were
the
actions
of
a
fool
,
''
said
*NL*
Mrs.
Epanchin
;
``
and
as
for
you
,
young
woman
,
you
ought
to
know
better
.
*NL*
At
all
events
,
you
are
not
to
talk
like
that
again
.
What
poem
is
it
?
*NL*
Recite
it
!
I
want
to
hear
this
poem
!
I
have
hated
poetry
all
my
life
.
*NL*
Prince
,
you
must
excuse
this
nonsense
.
We
neither
of
us
like
this
sort
*NL*
of
thing
!
Be
patient
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
certainly
were
put
out
,
both
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
tried
to
say
something
,
but
he
was
too
confused
,
and
could
*NL*
not
get
his
words
out
.
Aglaya
,
who
had
taken
such
liberties
in
her
*NL*
little
speech
,
was
the
only
person
present
,
perhaps
,
who
was
not
in
the
*NL*
least
embarrassed
.
She
seemed
,
in
fact
,
quite
pleased
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
now
rose
solemnly
from
her
seat
,
walked
to
the
centre
of
the
*NL*
terrace
,
and
stood
in
front
of
the
prince
's
chair
.
All
looked
on
with
*NL*
some
surprise
,
and
Prince
S.
and
her
sisters
with
feelings
of
decided
*NL*
alarm
,
to
see
what
new
frolic
she
was
up
to
;
it
had
gone
quite
far
*NL*
enough
already
,
they
thought
.
But
Aglaya
evidently
thoroughly
enjoyed
*NL*
the
affectation
and
ceremony
with
which
she
was
introducing
her
*NL*
recitation
of
the
poem
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Epanchin
was
just
wondering
whether
she
would
not
forbid
the
*NL*
performance
after
all
,
when
,
at
the
very
moment
that
Aglaya
commenced
*NL*
her
declamation
,
two
new
guests
,
both
talking
loudly
,
entered
from
the
*NL*
street
.
The
new
arrivals
were
General
Epanchin
and
a
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
entrance
caused
some
slight
commotion
.
*NL*
*NL*
VII
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
fellow
accompanying
the
general
was
about
twenty-eight
,
tall
,
*NL*
and
well
built
,
with
a
handsome
and
clever
face
,
and
bright
black
eyes
,
*NL*
full
of
fun
and
intelligence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aglaya
did
not
so
much
as
glance
at
the
new
arrivals
,
but
went
on
with
*NL*
her
recitation
,
gazing
at
the
prince
the
while
in
an
affected
manner
,
*NL*
and
at
him
alone
.
It
was
clear
to
him
that
she
was
doing
all
this
with
*NL*
some
special
object
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
new
guests
at
least
somewhat
eased
his
strained
and
*NL*
uncomfortable
position
.
Seeing
them
approaching
,
he
rose
from
his
chair
,
*NL*
and
nodding
amicably
to
the
general
,
signed
to
him
not
to
interrupt
the
*NL*
recitation
.
He
then
got
behind
his
chair
,
and
stood
there
with
his
left
*NL*
hand
resting
on
the
back
of
it
.
Thanks
to
this
change
of
position
,
*NL*
he
was
able
to
listen
to
the
ballad
with
far
less
embarrassment
than
*NL*
before
.
Mrs.
Epanchin
had
also
twice
motioned
to
the
new
arrivals
to
be
*NL*
quiet
,
and
stay
where
they
were
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
was
much
interested
in
the
young
man
who
had
just
entered
.
He
*NL*
easily
concluded
that
this
was
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
Radomski
,
of
whom
he
*NL*
had
already
heard
mention
several
times
.
He
was
puzzled
,
however
,
by
the
*NL*
young
man
's
plain
clothes
,
for
he
had
always
heard
of
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
*NL*
as
a
military
man
.
An
ironical
smile
played
on
Evgenie
's
lips
all
the
*NL*
while
the
recitation
was
proceeding
,
which
showed
that
he
,
too
,
was
*NL*
probably
in
the
secret
of
the
`
poor
knight
'
joke
.
But
it
had
become
*NL*
quite
a
different
matter
with
Aglaya
.
All
the
affectation
of
manner
*NL*
which
she
had
displayed
at
the
beginning
disappeared
as
the
ballad
*NL*
proceeded
.
She
spoke
the
lines
in
so
serious
and
exalted
a
manner
,
and
*NL*
with
so
much
taste
,
that
she
even
seemed
to
justify
the
exaggerated
*NL*
solemnity
with
which
she
had
stepped
forward
.
It
was
impossible
to
*NL*
discern
in
her
now
anything
but
a
deep
feeling
for
the
spirit
of
the
*NL*
poem
which
she
had
undertaken
to
interpret
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
eyes
were
aglow
with
inspiration
,
and
a
slight
tremor
of
rapture
*NL*
passed
over
her
lovely
features
once
or
twice
.
She
continued
to
recite
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Once
there
came
a
vision
glorious
,
*NL*
Mystic
,
dreadful
,
wondrous
fair
;
*NL*
Burned
itself
into
his
spirit
,
*NL*
And
abode
for
ever
there
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
more
--
from
that
sweet
moment
--
*NL*
Gazed
he
on
womankind
;
*NL*
He
was
dumb
to
love
and
wooing
*NL*
And
to
all
their
graces
blind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Full
of
love
for
that
sweet
vision
,
*NL*
Brave
and
pure
he
took
the
field
;
*NL*
With
his
blood
he
stained
the
letters
*NL*
N.
P.
B.
upon
his
shield
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Lumen
caeli
,
sancta
Rosa
!
'
*NL*
Shouting
on
the
foe
he
fell
,
*NL*
And
like
thunder
rang
his
war-cry
*NL*
O'er
the
cowering
infidel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
within
his
distant
castle
,
*NL*
Home
returned
,
he
dreamed
his
days
--
*NL*
Silent
,
sad
,
--
and
when
death
took
him
*NL*
He
was
mad
,
the
legend
says
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
recalling
all
this
afterwards
the
prince
could
not
for
the
life
of
*NL*
him
understand
how
to
reconcile
the
beautiful
,
sincere
,
pure
nature
of
*NL*
the
girl
with
the
irony
of
this
jest
.
That
it
was
a
jest
there
was
no
*NL*
doubt
whatever
;
he
knew
that
well
enough
,
and
had
good
reason
,
too
,
*NL*
for
his
conviction
;
for
during
her
recitation
of
the
ballad
Aglaya
had
*NL*
deliberately
changed
the
letters
A.
N.
B.
into
N.
P.
B
.
He
was
quite
*NL*
sure
she
had
not
done
this
by
accident
,
and
that
his
ears
had
not
*NL*
deceived
him
.
At
all
events
her
performance
--
which
was
a
joke
,
of
*NL*
course
,
if
rather
a
crude
one
,
--
was
premeditated
.
They
had
evidently
*NL*
talked
-LRB-
and
laughed
-RRB-
over
the
`
poor
knight
'
for
more
than
a
month
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
Aglaya
had
brought
out
these
letters
N.
P.
B.
not
only
without
the
*NL*
slightest
appearance
of
irony
,
or
even
any
particular
accentuation
,
but
*NL*
with
so
even
and
unbroken
an
appearance
of
seriousness
that
assuredly
*NL*
anyone
might
have
supposed
that
these
initials
were
the
original
ones
*NL*
written
in
the
ballad
.
The
thing
made
an
uncomfortable
impression
upon
*NL*
the
prince
.
Of
course
Mrs.
Epanchin
saw
nothing
either
in
the
change
of
*NL*
initials
or
in
the
insinuation
embodied
therein
.
General
Epanchin
only
*NL*
knew
that
there
was
a
recitation
of
verses
going
on
,
and
took
no
further
*NL*
interest
in
the
matter
.
Of
the
rest
of
the
audience
,
many
had
understood
*NL*
the
allusion
and
wondered
both
at
the
daring
of
the
lady
and
at
the
*NL*
motive
underlying
it
,
but
tried
to
show
no
sign
of
their
feelings
.
But
*NL*
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
-LRB-
as
the
prince
was
ready
to
wager
-RRB-
both
comprehended
*NL*
and
tried
his
best
to
show
that
he
comprehended
;
his
smile
was
too
*NL*
mocking
to
leave
any
doubt
on
that
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
beautiful
that
is
!
''
cried
Mrs.
Epanchin
,
with
sincere
admiration
.
*NL*
``
Whose
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pushkin
's
,
mama
,
of
course
!
Do
n't
disgrace
us
all
by
showing
your
*NL*
ignorance
,
''
said
Adelaida
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
soon
as
we
reach
home
give
it
to
me
to
read
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
we
have
a
copy
of
Pushkin
in
the
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
a
couple
of
torn
volumes
somewhere
;
they
have
been
lying
*NL*
about
from
time
immemorial
,
''
added
Alexandra
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Send
Feodor
or
Alexey
up
by
the
very
first
train
to
buy
a
copy
,
*NL*
then
.
--
Aglaya
,
come
here
--
kiss
me
,
dear
,
you
recited
beautifully
!
but
,
''
*NL*
she
added
in
a
whisper
,
``
if
you
were
sincere
I
am
sorry
for
you
.
If
it
*NL*
was
a
joke
,
I
do
not
approve
of
the
feelings
which
prompted
you
to
do
*NL*
it
,
and
in
any
case
you
would
have
done
far
better
not
to
recite
it
at
*NL*
all
.
Do
you
understand
?
--
Now
come
along
,
young
woman
;
we
've
sat
here
too
*NL*
long
.
I
'll
speak
to
you
about
this
another
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
the
prince
took
the
opportunity
of
greeting
General
Epanchin
,
*NL*
and
the
general
introduced
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
caught
him
up
on
the
way
to
your
house
,
''
explained
the
general
.
``
He
*NL*
had
heard
that
we
were
all
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
I
heard
that
you
were
here
,
too
,
''
added
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
;
*NL*
``
and
since
I
had
long
promised
myself
the
pleasure
of
seeking
not
only
*NL*
your
acquaintance
but
your
friendship
,
I
did
not
wish
to
waste
time
,
but
*NL*
came
straight
on
.
I
am
sorry
to
hear
that
you
are
unwell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
I
'm
quite
well
now
,
thank
you
,
and
very
glad
to
make
your
*NL*
acquaintance
.
Prince
S.
has
often
spoken
to
me
about
you
,
''
said
*NL*
Muishkin
,
and
for
an
instant
the
two
men
looked
intently
into
one
*NL*
another
's
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
remarked
that
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
's
plain
clothes
had
*NL*
evidently
made
a
great
impression
upon
the
company
present
,
so
much
so
*NL*
that
all
other
interests
seemed
to
be
effaced
before
this
surprising
*NL*
fact
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
change
of
dress
was
evidently
a
matter
of
some
importance
.
Adelaida
*NL*
and
Alexandra
poured
out
a
stream
of
questions
;
Prince
S.
,
a
relative
*NL*
of
the
young
man
,
appeared
annoyed
;
and
Ivan
Fedorovitch
quite
excited
.
*NL*
Aglaya
alone
was
not
interested
.
She
merely
looked
closely
at
Evgenie
*NL*
for
a
minute
,
curious
perhaps
as
to
whether
civil
or
military
clothes
*NL*
became
him
best
,
then
turned
away
and
paid
no
more
attention
to
him
or
*NL*
his
costume
.
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
asked
no
questions
,
but
it
was
clear
*NL*
that
she
was
uneasy
,
and
the
prince
fancied
that
Evgenie
was
not
in
her
*NL*
good
graces
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
astonished
me
,
''
said
Ivan
Fedorovitch
.
``
I
nearly
fell
down
with
*NL*
surprise
.
I
could
hardly
believe
my
eyes
when
I
met
him
in
Petersburg
*NL*
just
now
.
Why
this
haste
?
That
's
what
I
want
to
know
.
He
has
always
said
*NL*
himself
that
there
is
no
need
to
break
windows
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
remarked
here
that
he
had
spoken
of
his
intention
of
*NL*
leaving
the
service
long
ago
.
He
had
,
however
,
always
made
more
or
less
*NL*
of
a
joke
about
it
,
so
no
one
had
taken
him
seriously
.
For
that
matter
*NL*
he
joked
about
everything
,
and
his
friends
never
knew
what
to
believe
,
*NL*
especially
if
he
did
not
wish
them
to
understand
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
only
retired
for
a
time
,
''
said
he
,
laughing
.
``
For
a
few
months
;
*NL*
at
most
for
a
year
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
there
is
no
necessity
for
you
to
retire
at
all
,
''
complained
the
*NL*
general
,
``
as
far
as
I
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
go
and
look
after
my
country
estates
.
You
advised
me
to
do
*NL*
that
yourself
,
''
was
the
reply
.
``
And
then
I
wish
to
go
abroad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
few
more
expostulations
,
the
conversation
drifted
into
other
*NL*
channels
,
but
the
prince
,
who
had
been
an
attentive
listener
,
thought
*NL*
all
this
excitement
about
so
small
a
matter
very
curious
.
``
There
must
be
*NL*
more
in
it
than
appears
,
''
he
said
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
the
`
poor
knight
'
has
come
on
the
scene
again
,
''
said
Evgenie
*NL*
Pavlovitch
,
stepping
to
Aglaya
's
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
the
amazement
of
the
prince
,
who
overheard
the
remark
,
Aglaya
looked
*NL*
haughtily
and
inquiringly
at
the
questioner
,
as
though
she
would
give
*NL*
him
to
know
,
once
for
all
,
that
there
could
be
no
talk
between
them
*NL*
about
the
`
poor
knight
,
'
and
that
she
did
not
understand
his
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
not
now
!
It
is
too
late
to
send
to
town
for
a
Pushkin
now
.
It
is
*NL*
much
too
late
,
I
say
!
''
Colia
was
exclaiming
in
a
loud
voice
.
``
I
have
*NL*
told
you
so
at
least
a
hundred
times
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
is
really
much
too
late
to
send
to
town
now
,
''
said
Evgenie
*NL*
Pavlovitch
,
who
had
escaped
from
Aglaya
as
rapidly
as
possible
.
``
I
am
*NL*
sure
the
shops
are
shut
in
Petersburg
;
it
is
past
eight
o'clock
,
''
he
*NL*
added
,
looking
at
his
watch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
done
without
him
so
far
,
''
interrupted
Adelaida
in
her
turn
.
*NL*
``
Surely
we
can
wait
until
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Besides
,
''
said
Colia
,
``
it
is
quite
unusual
,
almost
improper
,
for
*NL*
people
in
our
position
to
take
any
interest
in
literature
.
Ask
Evgenie
*NL*
Pavlovitch
if
I
am
not
right
.
It
is
much
more
fashionable
to
drive
a
*NL*
waggonette
with
red
wheels
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
got
that
from
some
magazine
,
Colia
,
''
remarked
Adelaida
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
gets
most
of
his
conversation
in
that
way
,
''
laughed
Evgenie
*NL*
Pavlovitch
.
``
He
borrows
whole
phrases
from
the
reviews
.
I
have
long
*NL*
had
the
pleasure
of
knowing
both
Nicholai
Ardalionovitch
and
his
*NL*
conversational
methods
,
but
this
time
he
was
not
repeating
something
he
*NL*
had
read
;
he
was
alluding
,
no
doubt
,
to
my
yellow
waggonette
,
which
has
,
*NL*
or
had
,
red
wheels
.
But
I
have
exchanged
it
,
so
you
are
rather
behind
*NL*
the
times
,
Colia
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
had
been
listening
attentively
to
Radomski
's
words
,
and
*NL*
thought
his
manner
very
pleasant
.
When
Colia
chaffed
him
about
his
*NL*
waggonette
he
had
replied
with
perfect
equality
and
in
a
friendly
*NL*
fashion
.
This
pleased
Muishkin
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
Vera
came
up
to
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
,
carrying
several
*NL*
large
and
beautifully
bound
books
,
apparently
quite
new
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
demanded
the
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
Pushkin
,
''
replied
the
girl
.
``
Papa
told
me
to
offer
it
to
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
Impossible
!

exclaimed
Mrs.
Epanchin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
as
a
present

not
as
a
present

I
should
not
have
taken
the
*NL*
liberty

''
said
Lebedeff
,
appearing
suddenly
from
behind
his
daughter
.
*NL*
``
It
is
our
own
Pushkin
,
our
family
copy

Annenkoff

edition

I
beg
to
suggest
,
with
great
respect
,
that
your
*NL*
excellency
should
buy
it
,
and
thus
quench
the
noble
literary
thirst
*NL*
which
is
consuming
you
at
this
moment

he
concluded
grandiloquently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

you
will
sell
it

You
will
bring
me
the
books
yourself

*NL*
*NL*
``
With
the
greatest
respect

and

and
veneration

''
replied
Lebedeff
,
*NL*
making
extraordinary
grimaces
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
bring
them
,
with
or
without
respect

provided
always
you
do
not
*NL*
drop
them
on

on
the
condition

went
on
the
lady
,
looking
*NL*
full
at
him
,
``
that
you
do
not
cross
my
threshold

I
do
not
intend
to
*NL*
receive
you
today

You

send
your
daughter
Vera
at

if
you
like

*NL*
I
am
much
pleased
with
her

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
tell
him
about
them
?
''
said
Vera
impatiently
to
her
*NL*
father
.
``
They
will
come
in
,
whether
you
announce
them
or
not

and
they
*NL*
are
beginning
to
make
a
row

Lef
Nicolaievitch
,
''
--
she
addressed
herself
*NL*
to
the
prince
--
``
four
men
are
here
asking
for
you
.
They
have
waited
some
*NL*
time
,
and
are
beginning
to
make
a
fuss
,
and
papa
will
not
bring
them
*NL*
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
are
these
people
?
''
said
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
say
that
they
have
come
on
business
,
and
they
are
the
kind
of
men

*NL*
who
,
if
you
do
not
see
them
here
,
will
follow
you
about
the
street
.
*NL*
It
would
be
better
to
receive
them
,
and
then
you
will
get
rid
of
them
.
*NL*
Gavrila
Ardalionovitch
and
Ptitsin
are
both
there
,
trying
to
make
them
*NL*
hear
reason
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pavlicheff
's
son
!
It
is
not
worth
while
!

cried
Lebedeff
.
``
There
is
*NL*
no
necessity
to
see
them

and
it
would
be
most
unpleasant
for
your
*NL*
excellency

They
do
not
deserve
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
Pavlicheff
's
son
!
''
cried
the
prince
,
much
perturbed
.
``
I
know
...
*NL*
I
know
--
but
I
entrusted
this
matter
to
Gavrila
Ardalionovitch
.
He
told
*NL*
me
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
Gania
,
accompanied
by
Ptitsin
,
came
out
to
the
terrace
.
*NL*
From
an
adjoining
room
came
a
noise
of
angry
voices
,
and
General
*NL*
Ivolgin
,
in
loud
tones
,
seemed
to
be
trying
to
shout
them
down
.
Colia
*NL*
rushed
off
at
once
to
investigate
the
cause
of
the
uproar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
most
interesting
!
''
observed
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
expect
he
knows
all
about
it
!
''
thought
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
the
son
of
Pavlicheff
?
And
who
may
this
son
of
Pavlicheff
be
?
''
*NL*
asked
General
Epanchin
with
surprise
;
and
looking
curiously
around
him
,
*NL*
he
discovered
that
he
alone
had
no
clue
to
the
mystery
.
Expectation
and
*NL*
suspense
were
on
every
face
,
with
the
exception
of
that
of
the
prince
,
*NL*
who
stood
gravely
wondering
how
an
affair
so
entirely
personal
could
*NL*
have
awakened
such
lively
and
widespread
interest
in
so
short
a
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aglaya
went
up
to
him
with
a
peculiarly
serious
look
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
be
well
,
''
she
said
,
``
if
you
put
an
end
to
this
affair
yourself
*NL*
_
at
once
_
:
but
you
must
allow
us
to
be
your
witnesses
.
They
want
to
throw
*NL*
mud
at
you
,
prince
,
and
you
must
be
triumphantly
vindicated
.
I
give
you
*NL*
joy
beforehand
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
also
wish
for
justice
to
be
done
,
once
for
all
,
''
cried
Madame
*NL*
Epanchin
,
``
about
this
impudent
claim
.
Deal
with
them
promptly
,
prince
,
*NL*
and
do
n't
spare
them
!
I
am
sick
of
hearing
about
the
affair
,
and
many
a
*NL*
quarrel
I
have
had
in
your
cause
.
But
I
confess
I
am
anxious
to
see
what
*NL*
happens
,
so
do
make
them
come
out
here
,
and
we
will
remain
.
You
have
*NL*
heard
people
talking
about
it
,
no
doubt
?
''
she
added
,
turning
to
Prince
*NL*
S.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
''
said
he
.
``
I
have
heard
it
spoken
about
at
your
house
,
and
I
*NL*
am
anxious
to
see
these
young
men
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
Nihilists
,
are
they
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
they
are
not
Nihilists
,
''
explained
Lebedeff
,
who
seemed
much
*NL*
excited
.
``
This
is
another
lot
--
a
special
group
.
According
to
my
nephew
*NL*
they
are
more
advanced
even
than
the
Nihilists
.
You
are
quite
wrong
,
*NL*
excellency
,
if
you
think
that
your
presence
will
intimidate
them
;
*NL*
nothing
intimidates
them
.
Educated
men
,
learned
men
even
,
are
to
be
*NL*
found
among
Nihilists
;
these
go
further
,
in
that
they
are
men
of
action
.
*NL*
The
movement
is
,
properly
speaking
,
a
derivative
from
Nihilism
--
though
*NL*
they
are
only
known
indirectly
,
and
by
hearsay
,
for
they
never
advertise
*NL*
their
doings
in
the
papers
.
They
go
straight
to
the
point
.
For
them
,
it
*NL*
is
not
a
question
of
showing
that
Pushkin
is
stupid
,
or
that
Russia
must
*NL*
be
torn
in
pieces
.
No
;
but
if
they
have
a
great
desire
for
anything
,
*NL*
they
believe
they
have
a
right
to
get
it
even
at
the
cost
of
the
lives
,
*NL*
say
,
of
eight
persons
.
They
are
checked
by
no
obstacles
.
In
fact
,
*NL*
prince
,
I
should
not
advise
you
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Muishkin
had
risen
,
and
was
on
his
way
to
open
the
door
for
his
*NL*
visitors
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
slandering
them
,
Lebedeff
,
''
said
he
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
always
thinking
about
your
nephew
's
conduct
.
Do
n't
believe
*NL*
him
,
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
.
I
can
assure
you
Gorsky
and
Daniloff
are
*NL*
exceptions
--
and
that
these
are
only
...
mistaken
.
However
,
I
do
not
care
*NL*
about
receiving
them
here
,
in
public
.
Excuse
me
,
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
.
*NL*
They
are
coming
,
and
you
can
see
them
,
and
then
I
will
take
them
away
.
*NL*
Please
come
in
,
gentlemen
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Another
thought
tormented
him
:
He
wondered
was
this
an
arranged
*NL*
business
--
arranged
to
happen
when
he
had
guests
in
his
house
,
and
in
*NL*
anticipation
of
his
humiliation
rather
than
of
his
triumph
?
But
he
*NL*
reproached
himself
bitterly
for
such
a
thought
,
and
felt
as
if
he
should
*NL*
die
of
shame
if
it
were
discovered
.
When
his
new
visitors
appeared
,
he
*NL*
was
quite
ready
to
believe
himself
infinitely
less
to
be
respected
than
*NL*
any
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Four
persons
entered
,
led
by
General
Ivolgin
,
in
a
state
of
great
*NL*
excitement
,
and
talking
eloquently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
for
me
,
undoubtedly
!
''
thought
the
prince
,
with
a
smile
.
Colia
*NL*
also
had
joined
the
party
,
and
was
talking
with
animation
to
Hippolyte
,
*NL*
who
listened
with
a
jeering
smile
on
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
begged
the
visitors
to
sit
down
.
They
were
all
so
young
that
*NL*
it
made
the
proceedings
seem
even
more
extraordinary
.
Ivan
Fedorovitch
,
*NL*
who
really
understood
nothing
of
what
was
going
on
,
felt
indignant
at
*NL*
the
sight
of
these
youths
,
and
would
have
interfered
in
some
way
had
it
*NL*
not
been
for
the
extreme
interest
shown
by
his
wife
in
the
affair
.
*NL*
He
therefore
remained
,
partly
through
curiosity
,
partly
through
*NL*
good-nature
,
hoping
that
his
presence
might
be
of
some
use
.
But
the
bow
*NL*
with
which
General
Ivolgin
greeted
him
irritated
him
anew
;
he
frowned
,
*NL*
and
decided
to
be
absolutely
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
the
rest
,
one
was
a
man
of
thirty
,
the
retired
officer
,
now
a
*NL*
boxer
,
who
had
been
with
Rogojin
,
and
in
his
happier
days
had
given
*NL*
fifteen
roubles
at
a
time
to
beggars
.
Evidently
he
had
joined
the
others
*NL*
as
a
comrade
to
give
them
moral
,
and
if
necessary
material
,
support
.
The
*NL*
man
who
had
been
spoken
of
as
``
Pavlicheff
's
son
,
''
although
he
gave
the
*NL*
name
of
Antip
Burdovsky
,
was
about
twenty-two
years
of
age
,
fair
,
*NL*
thin
and
rather
tall
.
He
was
remarkable
for
the
poverty
,
not
to
say
*NL*
uncleanliness
,
of
his
personal
appearance
:
the
sleeves
of
his
overcoat
*NL*
were
greasy
;
his
dirty
waistcoat
,
buttoned
up
to
his
neck
,
showed
not
a
*NL*
trace
of
linen
;
a
filthy
black
silk
scarf
,
twisted
till
it
resembled
a
*NL*
cord
,
was
round
his
neck
,
and
his
hands
were
unwashed
.
He
looked
round
*NL*
with
an
air
of
insolent
effrontery
.
His
face
,
covered
with
pimples
,
*NL*
was
neither
thoughtful
nor
even
contemptuous
;
it
wore
an
expression
*NL*
of
complacent
satisfaction
in
demanding
his
rights
and
in
being
an
*NL*
aggrieved
party
.
His
voice
trembled
,
and
he
spoke
so
fast
,
and
with
such
*NL*
stammerings
,
that
he
might
have
been
taken
for
a
foreigner
,
though
*NL*
the
purest
Russian
blood
ran
in
his
veins
.
Lebedeff
's
nephew
,
whom
*NL*
the
reader
has
seen
already
,
accompanied
him
,
and
also
the
youth
named
*NL*
Hippolyte
Terentieff
.
The
latter
was
only
seventeen
or
eighteen
.
He
*NL*
had
an
intelligent
face
,
though
it
was
usually
irritated
and
fretful
*NL*
in
expression
.
His
skeleton-like
figure
,
his
ghastly
complexion
,
the
*NL*
brightness
of
his
eyes
,
and
the
red
spots
of
colour
on
his
cheeks
,
*NL*
betrayed
the
victim
of
consumption
to
the
most
casual
glance
.
He
coughed
*NL*
persistently
,
and
panted
for
breath
;
it
looked
as
though
he
had
but
*NL*
a
few
weeks
more
to
live
.
He
was
nearly
dead
with
fatigue
,
and
fell
,
*NL*
rather
than
sat
,
into
a
chair
.
The
rest
bowed
as
they
came
in
;
and
being
*NL*
more
or
less
abashed
,
put
on
an
air
of
extreme
self-assurance
.
In
short
,
*NL*
their
attitude
was
not
that
which
one
would
have
expected
in
men
who
*NL*
professed
to
despise
all
trivialities
,
all
foolish
mundane
conventions
,
*NL*
and
indeed
everything
,
except
their
own
personal
interests
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Antip
Burdovsky
,
''
stuttered
the
son
of
Pavlicheff
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Vladimir
Doktorenko
,
''
said
Lebedeff
's
nephew
briskly
,
and
with
a
*NL*
certain
pride
,
as
if
he
boasted
of
his
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Keller
,
''
murmured
the
retired
officer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hippolyte
Terentieff
,
''
cried
the
last-named
,
in
a
shrill
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
sat
now
in
a
row
facing
the
prince
,
and
frowned
,
and
played
with
*NL*
their
caps
.
All
appeared
ready
to
speak
,
and
yet
all
were
silent
;
the
*NL*
defiant
expression
on
their
faces
seemed
to
say
,
``
No
,
sir
,
you
do
n't
*NL*
take
us
in
!
''
It
could
be
felt
that
the
first
word
spoken
by
anyone
*NL*
present
would
bring
a
torrent
of
speech
from
the
whole
deputation
.
*NL*
*NL*
VIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
_
did
_
not
expect
you
,
gentlemen
,
''
began
the
prince
.
``
I
have
been
ill
*NL*
until
to-day
.
A
month
ago
,
''
he
continued
,
addressing
himself
to
Antip
*NL*
Burdovsky
,
``
I
put
your
business
into
Gavrila
Ardalionovitch
Ivolgin
's
*NL*
hands
,
as
I
told
you
then
.
I
do
not
in
the
least
object
to
having
a
*NL*
personal
interview
...
but
you
will
agree
with
me
that
this
is
hardly
the
*NL*
time
...
I
propose
that
we
go
into
another
room
,
if
you
will
not
keep
me
*NL*
long
...
As
you
see
,
I
have
friends
here
,
and
believe
me
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Friends
as
many
as
you
please
,
but
allow
me
,
''
interrupted
the
harsh
*NL*
voice
of
Lebedeff
's
nephew
--
``
allow
me
to
tell
you
that
you
might
have
*NL*
treated
us
rather
more
politely

and
not
have
kept
us
waiting
at
least
*NL*
two
hours

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I.

is
that
acting

And

be
a
general
!
But
I.
.

I
am
not
your
valet
!
And
I.

I.

''
stammered
*NL*
Antip
Burdovsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
extremely
excited
;
his
lips
trembled
,
and
the
resentment
of
an
*NL*
embittered
soul
was
in
his
voice
.
But
he
spoke
so
indistinctly
that
*NL*
hardly
a
dozen
words
could
be
gathered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a
princely
action
!
''
sneered
Hippolyte
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
anyone
had
treated
me
so
,
''
grumbled
the
boxer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
to
say
that
if
I
had
been
in
Burdovsky
's
place
...
I.
.
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
I
did
not
know
you
were
there
;
I
have
only
just
been
*NL*
informed
,
I
assure
you
,
''
repeated
Muishkin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
not
afraid
of
your
friends
,
prince
,
''
remarked
Lebedeff
's
nephew
,
*NL*
``
for
we
are
within
our
rights
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
shrill
tones
of
Hippolyte
interrupted
him
.
``
What
right
have
you
...
*NL*
by
what
right
do
you
demand
us
to
submit
this
matter
,
about
Burdovsky
...
*NL*
to
the
judgment
of
your
friends
?
We
know
only
too
well
what
the
judgment
*NL*
of
your
friends
will
be
!
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
beginning
gave
promise
of
a
stormy
discussion
.
The
prince
was
*NL*
much
discouraged
,
but
at
last
he
managed
to
make
himself
heard
amid
the
*NL*
vociferations
of
his
excited
visitors
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
,
''
he
said
,
addressing
Burdovsky
--
``
if
you
prefer
not
to
speak
*NL*
here

I
offer
again
to
go
into
another

gabbled
Burdovsky

defiantly
examining

round
him

becoming
more
and
more
excited
.
``
You

*NL*
As
he
ended
thus
abruptly
,
he
leant
forward
,
staring
at
the
prince
with
*NL*
his
short-sighted
,
bloodshot
eyes
.
The
latter
was
so
astonished
,
that
he
*NL*
did
not
reply
,
but
looked
steadily
at
him
in
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

Madame

suddenly

*NL*
She
held
out
a
weekly
comic
paper

pointing
to
an

on
one
of

its

Just
as
the
visitors
were
coming
in
,
Lebedeff
,
wishing
to
*NL*
ingratiate
himself
with
the
great

,
had
pulled
this

from
his
*NL*
pocket
,
and
presented
it
to
her
,
indicating
a
few
columns
marked
in
*NL*
pencil
.
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
had
had
time
to
read
some
of
it
,
and
was
*NL*
greatly
upset
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
it
not
be
better
to

''
later
asked
the
prince
,
*NL*
nervously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

cried

she

calling

to

giving
him

An

sometimes
weighed
her

put

Ivan

felt
a
sudden
pang
of
alarm

but
the
others

merely
curious

somewhat
surprised

Strange
things
are
going
on
in
our
so-called
Holy
Russia
in
this
age
of
*NL*
reform
and
great
enterprises
;
this
age
of
patriotism
in
which
hundreds
*NL*
of
millions
are
yearly
sent
abroad
;
in
which
industry
is
encouraged
,
and
*NL*
the
hands
of
Labour
paralyzed
,
etc.
;
there
is
no
end
to
this
,
gentlemen
,
*NL*
so
let
us
come
to
the
point
.
A
strange
thing
has
happened
to
a
scion
*NL*
of
our
defunct
aristocracy
.
-LRB-
_
De
profundis
!
_
-RRB-
The
grandfathers
of
these
*NL*
scions
ruined
themselves
at
the
gaming-tables
;
their
fathers
were
forced
*NL*
to
serve
as
officers
or
subalterns
;
some
have
died
just
as
they
were
*NL*
about
to
be
tried
for
innocent
thoughtlessness
in
the
handling
of
public
*NL*
funds
.
Their
children
are
sometimes
congenital
idiots
,
like
the
hero
of
*NL*
our
story
;
sometimes
they
are
found
in
the
dock
at
the
Assizes
,
where
*NL*
they
are
generally
acquitted
by
the
jury
for
edifying
motives
;
sometimes
*NL*
they
distinguish
themselves
by
one
of
those
burning
scandals
that
amaze
*NL*
the
public
and
add
another
blot
to
the
stained
record
of
our
age
.
Six
*NL*
months
ago
--
that
is
,
last
winter
--
this
particular
scion
returned
to
*NL*
Russia
,
wearing
gaiters
like
a
foreigner
,
and
shivering
with
cold
in
*NL*
an
old
scantily-lined
cloak
.
He
had
come
from
Switzerland
,
where
he
*NL*
had
just
undergone
a
successful
course
of
treatment
for
idiocy
-LRB-
_
sic
!
_
-RRB-
.
*NL*
Certainly
Fortune
favoured
him
,
for
,
apart
from
the
interesting
malady
*NL*
of
which
he
was
cured
in
Switzerland
-LRB-
can
there
be
a
cure
for
idiocy
?
-RRB-
*NL*
his
story
proves
the
truth
of
the
Russian
proverb
that
`
happiness
is
*NL*
the
right
of
certain
classes
!
'
Judge
for
yourselves
.
Our
subject
was
an
*NL*
infant
in
arms
when
he
lost
his
father
,
an
officer
who
died
just
as
*NL*
he
was
about
to
be
court-martialled
for
gambling
away
the
funds
of
his
*NL*
company
,
and
perhaps
also
for
flogging
a
subordinate
to
excess
-LRB-
remember
*NL*
the
good
old
days
,
gentlemen
-RRB-
.
The
orphan
was
brought
up
by
the
charity
*NL*
of
a
very
rich
Russian
landowner
.
In
the
good
old
days
,
this
man
,
*NL*
whom
we
will
call
P
--
,
owned
four
thousand
souls
as
serfs
-LRB-
souls
as
*NL*
serfs
!
--
can
you
understand
such
an
expression
,
gentlemen
?
I
can
not
;
it
*NL*
must
be
looked
up
in
a
dictionary
before
one
can
understand
it
;
these
*NL*
things
of
a
bygone
day
are
already
unintelligible
to
us
-RRB-
.
He
appears
*NL*
to
have
been
one
of
those
Russian
parasites
who
lead
an
idle
existence
*NL*
abroad
,
spending
the
summer
at
some
spa
,
and
the
winter
in
Paris
,
to
the
*NL*
greater
profit
of
the
organizers
of
public
balls
.
It
may
safely
be
said
*NL*
that
the
manager
of
the
Chateau
des
Fleurs
-LRB-
lucky
man
!
-RRB-
pocketed
at
*NL*
least
a
third
of
the
money
paid
by
Russian
peasants
to
their
lords
in
*NL*
the
days
of
serfdom
.
However
this
may
be
,
the
gay
P
--
brought
up
the
*NL*
orphan
like
a
prince
,
provided
him
with
tutors
and
governesses
-LRB-
pretty
,
*NL*
of
course
!
-RRB-
whom
he
chose
himself
in
Paris
.
But
the
little
aristocrat
,
*NL*
the
last
of
his
noble
race
,
was
an
idiot
.
The
governesses
,
recruited
at
*NL*
the
Chateau
des
Fleurs
,
laboured
in
vain
;
at
twenty
years
of
age
their
*NL*
pupil
could
not
speak
in
any
language
,
not
even
Russian
.
But
ignorance
*NL*
of
the
latter
was
still
excusable
.
At
last
P
--
was
seized
with
a
*NL*
strange
notion
;
he
imagined
that
in
Switzerland
they
could
change
an
*NL*
idiot
into
a
mail
of
sense
.
After
all
,
the
idea
was
quite
logical
;
*NL*
a
parasite
and
landowner
naturally
supposed
that
intelligence
was
a
*NL*
marketable
commodity
like
everything
else
,
and
that
in
Switzerland
*NL*
especially
it
could
be
bought
for
money
.
The
case
was
entrusted
to
a
*NL*
celebrated
Swiss
professor
,
and
cost
thousands
of
roubles
;
the
*NL*
treatment
lasted
five
years
.
Needless
to
say
,
the
idiot
did
not
become
*NL*
intelligent
,
but
it
is
alleged
that
he
grew
into
something
more
or
less
*NL*
resembling
a
man
.
At
this
stage
P
--
died
suddenly
,
and
,
as
usual
,
*NL*
he
had
made
no
will
and
left
his
affairs
in
disorder
.
A
crowd
of
eager
*NL*
claimants
arose
,
who
cared
nothing
about
any
last
scion
of
a
noble
race
*NL*
undergoing
treatment
in
Switzerland
,
at
the
expense
of
the
deceased
,
as
*NL*
a
congenital
idiot
.
Idiot
though
he
was
,
the
noble
scion
tried
to
cheat
*NL*
his
professor
,
and
they
say
he
succeeded
in
getting
him
to
continue
*NL*
the
treatment
gratis
for
two
years
,
by
concealing
the
death
of
his
*NL*
benefactor
.
But
the
professor
himself
was
a
charlatan
.
Getting
anxious
*NL*
at
last
when
no
money
was
forthcoming
,
and
alarmed
above
all
by
his
*NL*
patient
's
appetite
,
he
presented
him
with
a
pair
of
old
gaiters
and
a
*NL*
shabby
cloak
and
packed
him
off
to
Russia
,
third
class
.
It
would
seem
*NL*
that
Fortune
had
turned
her
back
upon
our
hero
.
Not
at
all
;
Fortune
,
*NL*
who
lets
whole
populations
die
of
hunger
,
showered
all
her
gifts
at
once
*NL*
upon
the
little
aristocrat
,
like
Kryloff
's
Cloud
which
passes
over
an
*NL*
arid
plain
and
empties
itself
into
the
sea
.
He
had
scarcely
arrived
in
*NL*
St.
Petersburg
,
when
a
relation
of
his
mother
's
-LRB-
who
was
of
bourgeois
*NL*
origin
,
of
course
-RRB-
,
died
at
Moscow
.
He
was
a
merchant
,
an
Old
Believer
,
*NL*
and
he
had
no
children
.
He
left
a
fortune
of
several
millions
in
good
*NL*
current
coin
,
and
everything
came
to
our
noble
scion
,
our
gaitered
*NL*
baron
,
formerly
treated
for
idiocy
in
a
Swiss
lunatic
asylum
.
Instantly
*NL*
the
scene
changed
,
crowds
of
friends
gathered
round
our
baron
,
who
*NL*
meanwhile
had
lost
his
head
over
a
celebrated
demi-mondaine
;
he
even
*NL*
discovered
some
relations
;
moreover
a
number
of
young
girls
of
high
*NL*
birth
burned
to
be
united
to
him
in
lawful
matrimony
.
Could
anyone
*NL*
possibly
imagine
a
better
match
?
Aristocrat
,
millionaire
,
and
idiot
,
he
*NL*
has
every
advantage
!
One
might
hunt
in
vain
for
his
equal
,
even
with
the
*NL*
lantern
of
Diogenes
;
his
like
is
not
to
be
had
even
by
getting
it
made
*NL*
to
order
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
know
what
this
means
''
cried
Ivan
Fedorovitch
,
transported
*NL*
with
indignation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
off
,
Colia
,
''
begged
the
prince
.
Exclamations
arose
on
all
sides
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
him
go
on
reading
at
all
costs
!
''
ordered
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
,
*NL*
evidently
preserving
her
composure
by
a
desperate
effort
.
``
Prince
,
if
*NL*
the
reading
is
stopped
,
you
and
I
will
quarrel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Colia
had
no
choice
but
to
obey
.
With
crimson
cheeks
he
read
on
*NL*
unsteadily
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
while
our
young
millionaire
dwelt
as
it
were
in
the
Empyrean
,
*NL*
something
new
occurred
.
One
fine
morning
a
man
called
upon
him
,
calm
and
*NL*
severe
of
aspect
,
distinguished
,
but
plainly
dressed
.
Politely
,
but
in
*NL*
dignified
terms
,
as
befitted
his
errand
,
he
briefly
explained
the
motive
*NL*
for
his
visit
.
He
was
a
lawyer
of
enlightened
views
;
his
client
was
a
*NL*
young
man
who
had
consulted
him
in
confidence
.
This
young
man
was
no
*NL*
other
than
the
son
of
P
--
,
though
he
bears
another
name
.
In
his
youth
*NL*
P
--
,
the
sensualist
,
had
seduced
a
young
girl
,
poor
but
respectable
.
She
*NL*
was
a
serf
,
but
had
received
a
European
education
.
Finding
that
a
child
*NL*
was
expected
,
he
hastened
her
marriage
with
a
man
of
noble
character
who
*NL*
had
loved
her
for
a
long
time
.
He
helped
the
young
couple
for
a
time
,
*NL*
but
he
was
soon
obliged
to
give
up
,
for
the
high-minded
husband
refused
*NL*
to
accept
anything
from
him
.
Soon
the
careless
nobleman
forgot
all
about
*NL*
his
former
mistress
and
the
child
she
had
borne
him
;
then
,
as
we
know
,
*NL*
he
died
intestate
.
P
--
's
son
,
born
after
his
mother
's
marriage
,
found
*NL*
a
true
father
in
the
generous
man
whose
name
he
bore
.
But
when
he
also
*NL*
died
,
the
orphan
was
left
to
provide
for
himself
,
his
mother
now
being
*NL*
an
invalid
who
had
lost
the
use
of
her
limbs
.
Leaving
her
in
a
distant
*NL*
province
,
he
came
to
the
capital
in
search
of
pupils
.
By
dint
of
daily
*NL*
toil
he
earned
enough
to
enable
him
to
follow
the
college
courses
,
and
*NL*
at
last
to
enter
the
university
.
But
what
can
one
earn
by
teaching
the
*NL*
children
of
Russian
merchants
at
ten
copecks
a
lesson
,
especially
with
*NL*
an
invalid
mother
to
keep
?
Even
her
death
did
not
much
diminish
the
*NL*
hardships
of
the
young
man
's
struggle
for
existence
.
Now
this
is
the
*NL*
question
:
how
,
in
the
name
of
justice
,
should
our
scion
have
argued
the
*NL*
case
?
Our
readers
will
think
,
no
doubt
,
that
he
would
say
to
himself
:
*NL*
`
P
--
showered
benefits
upon
me
all
my
life
;
he
spent
tens
of
thousands
*NL*
of
roubles
to
educate
me
,
to
provide
me
with
governesses
,
and
to
keep
me
*NL*
under
treatment
in
Switzerland
.
Now
I
am
a
millionaire
,
and
P
--
's
son
,
*NL*
a
noble
young
man
who
is
not
responsible
for
the
faults
of
his
careless
*NL*
and
forgetful
father
,
is
wearing
himself
out
giving
ill-paid
lessons
.
*NL*
According
to
justice
,
all
that
was
done
for
me
ought
to
have
been
done
*NL*
for
him
.
The
enormous
sums
spent
upon
me
were
not
really
mine
;
they
*NL*
came
to
me
by
an
error
of
blind
Fortune
,
when
they
ought
to
have
gone
to
*NL*
P
--
's
son
.
They
should
have
gone
to
benefit
him
,
not
me
,
in
whom
P
--
*NL*
interested
himself
by
a
mere
caprice
,
instead
of
doing
his
duty
as
a
*NL*
father
.
If
I
wished
to
behave
nobly
,
justly
,
and
with
delicacy
,
I
ought
*NL*
to
bestow
half
my
fortune
upon
the
son
of
my
benefactor
;
but
as
economy
*NL*
is
my
favourite
virtue
,
and
I
know
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
the
law
*NL*
can
intervene
,
I
will
not
give
up
half
my
millions
.
But
it
would
be
too
*NL*
openly
vile
,
too
flagrantly
infamous
,
if
I
did
not
at
least
restore
to
*NL*
P
--
's
son
the
tens
of
thousands
of
roubles
spent
in
curing
my
idiocy
.
*NL*
This
is
simply
a
case
of
conscience
and
of
strict
justice
.
Whatever
*NL*
would
have
become
of
me
if
P
--
had
not
looked
after
my
education
,
and
*NL*
had
taken
care
of
his
own
son
instead
of
me
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
gentlemen
,
our
scions
of
the
nobility
do
not
reason
thus
.
The
*NL*
lawyer
,
who
had
taken
up
the
matter
purely
out
of
friendship
to
the
*NL*
young
man
,
and
almost
against
his
will
,
invoked
every
consideration
*NL*

justice

delicacy

,
and
even
plain
figures
;
in
vain
,
the
*NL*
ex-patient
of
the
Swiss
lunatic
asylum
was
inflexible
.
All
this
might
*NL*
pass
,
but
the
sequel
is
absolutely
unpardonable
,
and
not
to
be
excused
*NL*
by
any
interesting
malady

This
millionaire
,
having
but
just
discarded

old
gaiters
of
his
professor
,
could
not
even
understand
that
*NL*
the
noble
young
man
slaving
away
at
his
lessons
was
not
asking
for
*NL*
charitable
help
,
but
for
his
rightful
due
,
though
the
debt
was
not
a
*NL*
legal
one
;
that
,
correctly
speaking
,
he
was
not
asking
for
anything
,
but
*NL*
it
was
merely
his
friends
who
had
thought
fit
to
bestir
themselves
on
*NL*
his
behalf
.
With
the
cool
insolence
of
a
bloated
capitalist
,
secure
in
*NL*
his
millions
,
he
majestically
drew
a
banknote
for
fifty
roubles
from
his
*NL*
pocket-book
and
sent
it
to
the
noble
young
man
as
a
humiliating
piece
of
*NL*
charity
.
You
can
hardly
believe
it
,
gentlemen
!
You
are
scandalized
and
*NL*
disgusted
;
you
cry
out
in
indignation
!
But
that
is
what
he
did
!
Needless
*NL*
to
say
,
the
money
was
returned
,
or
rather
flung
back
in
his
face
.
The
*NL*
case
is
not
within
the
province
of
the
law
,
it
must
be
referred
to
the
*NL*
tribunal
of
public
opinion
;
this
is
what
we
now
do
,
guaranteeing
the
*NL*
truth
of
all
the
details
which
we
have
related
.

When
Colia
had
finished
reading
,
he
handed
the
paper
to
the
prince
,
and
*NL*
retired
silently
to
a
corner
of
the
room
,
hiding
his
face
in
his
*NL*
hands
.
He
was
overcome
by
a
feeling
of
inexpressible
shame
;
his
boyish
*NL*
sensitiveness
was
wounded
beyond
endurance
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
*NL*
something
extraordinary
,
some
sudden
catastrophe
had
occurred
,
and
that
*NL*
he
was
almost
the
cause
of
it
,
because
he
had
read
the
article
aloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
all
the
others
were
similarly
affected
.
The
girls
were
uncomfortable
*NL*
and
ashamed
.
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
restrained
her
violent
anger
by
a
*NL*
great
effort
;
perhaps
she
bitterly
regretted
her
interference
in
the
*NL*
matter
;
for
the
present
she
kept
silence
.
The
prince
felt
as
very
shy
*NL*
people
often
do
in
such
a
case
;
he
was
so
ashamed
of
the
conduct
of
*NL*
other
people
,
so
humiliated
for
his
guests
,
that
he
dared
not
look
them
*NL*
in
the
face
.
Ptitsin
,
Varia
,
Gania
,
and
Lebedeff
himself
,
all
looked
*NL*
rather
confused
.
Stranger
still
,
Hippolyte
and
the
``
son
of
Pavlicheff
''
*NL*
also
seemed
slightly
surprised
,
and
Lebedeff
's
nephew
was
obviously
*NL*
far
from
pleased
.
The
boxer
alone
was
perfectly
calm
;
he
twisted
his
*NL*
moustaches
with
affected
dignity
,
and
if
his
eyes
were
cast
down
it
was
*NL*
certainly
not
in
confusion
,
but
rather
in
noble
modesty
,
as
if
he
did
*NL*
not
wish
to
be
insolent
in
his
triumph
.
It
was
evident
that
he
was
*NL*
delighted
with
the
article
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
devil
knows
what
it
means
,
''
growled
Ivan
Fedorovitch
,
under
his
*NL*
breath
;
``
it
must
have
taken
the
united
wits
of
fifty
footmen
to
write
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
ask
your
reason
for
such
an
insulting
supposition
,
sir
?
''
said
*NL*
Hippolyte
,
trembling
with
rage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
admit
yourself
,
general
,
that
for
an
honourable
man
,
if
the
*NL*
author
is
an
honourable
man
,
that
is
an
--
an
insult

growled
the
boxer
*NL*
suddenly
,
with
convulsive
jerkings
of
his
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
first
place
,
it
is
not
for
you
to
address
me
as
`
sir
,
'
and
,
*NL*
in
the
second
place
,
I
refuse
to
give
you
any
explanation
,
''
said
Ivan
*NL*
Fedorovitch
vehemently
;
and
he
rose
without
another
word
,
and
went
and
*NL*
stood
on
the
first
step
of
the
flight
that
led
from
the
verandah
to
the
*NL*
street
,
turning
his
back
on
the
company
.
He
was
indignant
with
Lizabetha
*NL*
Prokofievna
,
who
did
not
think
of
moving
even
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
gentlemen
,
let
me
speak
at
last
,
''
cried
the
prince
,
anxious
*NL*
and
agitated
.
``
Please
let
us
understand
one
another
.
I
say
nothing
about
*NL*
the
article
,
gentlemen
,
except
that
every
word
is
false
;
I
say
this
*NL*
because
you
know
it
as
well
as
I
do
.
It
is
shameful
.
I
should
be
*NL*
surprised
if
any
one
of
you
could
have
written
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
know
of
its
existence
till
this
moment

declared
Hippolyte
.
*NL*
``
I
do
not
approve
of
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
it
had
been
written
,
but
I
would
not
have
advised
its
*NL*
publication

said
Lebedeff
's
nephew
,
``
because
it
is
premature

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
it
,
but
I
have
a
right

I.

stammered
the
``
son
of
*NL*
Pavlicheff
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
Did
you
write
all
that
yourself
?
Is
it
possible
?
''
asked
the
*NL*
prince
,
regarding
Burdovsky
with
curiosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
might
dispute
your
right
to
ask
such
questions
,
''
observed
*NL*
Lebedeff
's
nephew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
only
surprised
that
Mr.
Burdovsky
should
have
--
however
,
this
is
*NL*
what
I
have
to
say
.
Since
you
had
already
given
the
matter
publicity
,
*NL*
why
did
you
object
just
now
,
when
I
began
to
speak
of
it
to
my
friends
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
last
!
''
murmured
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
indignantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lebedeff
could
restrain
himself
no
longer
;
he
made
his
way
through
the
*NL*
row
of
chairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Prince
,
''
he
cried
,
``
you
are
forgetting
that
if
you
consented
to
receive
*NL*
and
hear
them
,
it
was
only
because
of
your
kind
heart
which
has
no
*NL*
equal
,
for
they
had
not
the
least
right
to
demand
it
,
especially
as
you
*NL*
had
placed
the
matter
in
the
hands
of
Gavrila
Ardalionovitch
,
which
*NL*
was
also
extremely
kind
of
you
.
You
are
also
forgetting
,
most
excellent
*NL*
prince
,
that
you
are
with
friends
,
a
select
company
;
you
can
not
*NL*
sacrifice
them
to
these
gentlemen
,
and
it
is
only
for
you
to
have
them
*NL*
turned
out
this
instant
.
As
the
master
of
the
house
I
shall
have
great
*NL*
pleasure
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
right
!
''
agreed
General
Ivolgin
in
a
loud
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
do
,
Lebedeff
,
that
will
do

''
began
the
prince
,
when
an
*NL*
indignant
outcry
drowned
his
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
prince
,
excuse
me
,
but
now
that
will
not
do
,
''
shouted
*NL*
Lebedeff
's
nephew
,
his
voice
dominating
all
the
others
.
``
The
matter
must
*NL*
be
clearly
stated
,
for
it
is
obviously
not
properly
understood
.
They
*NL*
are
calling
in
some
legal
chicanery
,
and
upon
that
ground
they
are
*NL*
threatening
to
turn
us
out
of
the
house
!
Really
,
prince
,
do
you
think
we
*NL*
are
such
fools
as
not
to
be
aware
that
this
matter
does
not
come
within
*NL*
the
law
,
and
that
legally
we
can
not
claim
a
rouble
from
you
?
But
we
are
*NL*
also
aware
that
if
actual
law
is
not
on
our
side
,
human
law
is
for
us
,
*NL*
natural
law
,
the
law
of
common-sense
and
conscience
,
which
is
no
less
*NL*
binding
upon
every
noble
and
honest
man
--
that
is
,
every
man
of
sane
*NL*
judgment
--
because
it
is
not
to
be
found
in
miserable
legal
codes
.
If
we
*NL*
come
here
without
fear
of
being
turned
out
-LRB-
as
was
threatened
just
now
-RRB-
*NL*
because
of
the
imperative
tone
of
our
demand
,
and
the
unseemliness
of
*NL*
such
a
visit
at
this
late
hour
-LRB-
though
it
was
not
late
when
we
arrived
,
*NL*
we
were
kept
waiting
in
your
anteroom
-RRB-
,
if
,
I
say
,
we
came
in
without
*NL*
fear
,
it
is
just
because
we
expected
to
find
you
a
man
of
sense
;
I
mean
,
*NL*
a
man
of
honour
and
conscience
.
It
is
quite
true
that
we
did
not
present
*NL*
ourselves
humbly
,
like
your
flatterers
and
parasites
,
but
holding
up
our
*NL*
heads
as
befits
independent
men
.
We
present
no
petition
,
but
a
proud
and
*NL*
free
demand
-LRB-
note
it
well
,
we
do
not
beseech
,
we
demand
!
-RRB-
.
We
ask
you
*NL*
fairly
and
squarely
in
a
dignified
manner
.
Do
you
believe
that
in
this
*NL*
affair
of
Burdovsky
you
have
right
on
your
side
?
Do
you
admit
that
*NL*
Pavlicheff
overwhelmed
you
with
benefits
,
and
perhaps
saved
your
life
?
*NL*
If
you
admit
it
-LRB-
which
we
take
for
granted
-RRB-
,
do
you
intend
,
now
that
you
*NL*
are
a
millionaire
,
and
do
you
not
think
it
in
conformity
with
justice
,
*NL*
to
indemnify
Burdovsky
?
Yes
or
no
?
If
it
is
yes
,
or
,
in
other
words
,
if
*NL*
you
possess
what
you
call
honour
and
conscience
,
and
we
more
justly
call
*NL*
common-sense
,
then
accede
to
our
demand
,
and
the
matter
is
at
an
end
.
*NL*
Give
us
satisfaction
,
without
entreaties
or
thanks
from
us
;
do
not
*NL*
expect
thanks
from
us
,
for
what
you
do
will
be
done
not
for
our
sake
,
*NL*
but
for
the
sake
of
justice
.
If
you
refuse
to
satisfy
us
,
that
is
,
if
*NL*
your
answer
is
no
,
we
will
go
away
at
once
,
and
there
will
be
an
end
of
*NL*
the
matter
.
But
we
will
tell
you
to
your
face
before
the
present
company
*NL*
that
you
are
a
man
of
vulgar
and
undeveloped
mind
;
we
will
openly
deny
*NL*
you
the
right
to
speak
in
future
of
your
honour
and
conscience
,
for
you
*NL*
have
not
paid
the
fair
price
of
such
a
right
.
I
have
no
more
to
say
--
I
*NL*
have
put
the
question
before
you
.
Now
turn
us
out
if
you
dare
.
You
can
*NL*
do
it
;
force
is
on
your
side
.
But
remember
that
we
do
not
beseech
,
we
*NL*
demand
!
We
do
not
beseech
,
we
demand
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
last
excited
words
,
Lebedeff
's
nephew
was
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
demand
,
we
demand
,
we
demand
,
we
do
not
beseech

spluttered
*NL*
Burdovsky
,
red
as
a
lobster
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
speech
of
Lebedeff
's
nephew
caused
a
certain
stir
among
the
company
;
*NL*
murmurs
arose
,
though
with
the
exception
of
Lebedeff
,
who
was
still
*NL*
very
much
excited
,
everyone
was
careful
not
to
interfere
in
the
matter
.
*NL*
Strangely
enough
,
Lebedeff
,
although
on
the
prince
's
side
,
seemed
quite
*NL*
proud
of
his
nephew
's
eloquence
.
Gratified
vanity
was
visible
in
the
*NL*
glances
he
cast
upon
the
assembled
company
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
my
opinion
,
Mr.
Doktorenko
,
''
said
the
prince
,
in
rather
a
low
*NL*
voice
,
``
you
are
quite
right
in
at
least
half
of
what
you
say
.
I
would
*NL*
go
further
and
say
that
you
are
altogether
right
,
and
that
I
quite
agree
*NL*
with
you
,
if
there
were
not
something
lacking
in
your
speech
.
I
can
not
*NL*
undertake
to
say
precisely
what
it
is
,
but
you
have
certainly
omitted
*NL*
something
,
and
you
can
not
be
quite
just
while
there
is
something
*NL*
lacking
.
But
let
us
put
that
aside
and
return
to
the
point
.
Tell
me
what
*NL*
induced
you
to
publish
this
article
.
Every
word
of
it
is
a
calumny
,
and
*NL*
I
think
,
gentlemen
,
that
you
have
been
guilty
of
a
mean
action
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Allow
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
What
?
What
?

cried
all
the
visitors
at
once
,
in
violent
*NL*
agitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
to
the
article
,
''
said
Hippolyte
in
his
croaking
voice
,
``
I
have
told
*NL*
you
already
that
we
none
of
us
approve
of

There
is
the
writer

''
he
*NL*
added
,
pointing
to
the
boxer
,
who
sat
beside
him
.
``
I
quite
admit
that
he
*NL*
has
written
it
in
his
old
regimental
manner
,
with
an
equal
disregard
*NL*
for
style
and
decency
.
I
know
he
is
a
cross
between
a
fool
and
an
*NL*
adventurer
;
I
make
no
bones
about
telling
him
so
to
his
face
every
day
.
*NL*
But
after
all
he
is
half
justified
;
publicity
is
the
lawful
right
of
*NL*
every
man
;
consequently
,
Burdovsky
is
not
excepted
.
Let
him
answer
for
*NL*
his
own
blunders
.
As
to
the
objection
which
I
made
just
now
in
the
name
*NL*
of
all
,
to
the
presence
of
your
friends
,
I
think
I
ought
to
explain
,
*NL*
gentlemen
,
that
I
only
did
so
to
assert
our
rights
,
though
we
really
*NL*
wished
to
have
witnesses
;
we
had
agreed
unanimously
upon
the
point
*NL*
before
we
came
in
.
We
do
not
care
who
your
witnesses
may
be
,
or
*NL*
whether
they
are
your
friends
or
not
.
As
they
can
not
fail
to
recognize
*NL*
Burdovsky
's
right
-LRB-
seeing
that
it
is
mathematically
demonstrable
-RRB-
,
it
is
*NL*
just
as
well
that
the
witnesses
should
be
your
friends
.
The
truth
will
*NL*
only
be
more
plainly
evident
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
quite
true

we
had
agreed
upon
that
point

said
Lebedeff
's
*NL*
nephew
,
in
confirmation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
that
is
the
case

why
did
you
begin
by
making
such
a
fuss
about
it

*NL*
asked
the
astonished
prince

*NL*
*NL*
The
boxer
was
dying
to
get
in
a
few
words
;
owing
,
no
doubt
,
to
the
*NL*
presence
of
the
ladies
,
he
was
becoming
quite
jovial
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
to
the
article

he
said
,
``
I
admit

I
wrote

severe

I
wrote

published
it
in
the

in

I
showed

it
to
no

Burdovsky

and
I
did
not
read
it
all
through
,
even
to
*NL*
him
.
He
immediately
gave
me
permission
to
publish
it
,
but
you
will
admit
*NL*
that
I
might
have
done
so
without
his
consent
.
Publicity
is
a
noble
,
*NL*
beneficent
,
and
universal
right

I
hope

that
you
are
too
*NL*
progressive
to
deny
this
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

you

yourself

So
much

It

a

question

above

of

Five
weeks

I
received
a
visit
from

Tchebaroff

your

Mr.

You
have
given

continued

turning

he

was
the
moving

in

and
,
to
speak

frankly
,
I
thought
he
might
have
induced
you

claim

by
taking
advantage

your

much
*NL*
agitated

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
no
sort

said
Lebedeff

*NL*
nephew
in
a
tone
of
authority
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
most
offensive

Hippolyte

``
it
is
an

false

*NL*
``
I

said
the

``
I
*NL*
thought
absolute
frankness
on
both
sides
would
be
best

but
have
it

I
told
Tchebaroff
that

as
I
was
not

I
would

commission

look

I
have
no

do
not

touchy

the

seeing
that
*NL*
Burdovsky
was
getting
excited
again

that
the
rest
were
preparing

to
protest

``
If
I
say
I
suspected

there

nothing

I

I
did
not
even
know

I
only
judged
by

quite
generally

I
have
been

*NL*
``
You

shockingly
naive

said
Lebedeff
's
nephew
in
mocking
*NL*
tones
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Besides
,
though
you
are
a
prince
and
a
millionaire
,
and
even
though
*NL*
you
may
really
be
simple
and
good-hearted
,
you
can
hardly
be
outside
the
*NL*
general
law

''
Hippolyte
declared
loudly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
not
;
it
is
very
possible

''
the
prince
agreed
hastily
,
``
though
I
*NL*
do
not

what
general
law
you
allude

I
will
go
on

only

do
not
take
offence
without
good
cause

I
assure
you
I
do
not
mean
to
*NL*
offend
you
in
the
least
.
Really
,
it
is
impossible
to
speak
three
words
*NL*
sincerely
without
your
flying
into
a
rage
!
At
first
I
was
amazed
when
*NL*
Tchebaroff
told
me
that
Pavlicheff
had
a
son
,
and
that
he
was
in
such
*NL*
a
miserable
position
.
Pavlicheff
was
my
benefactor
,
and
my
father
's
*NL*
friend
.
Oh
,
Mr.
Keller
,
why
does
your
article
impute
things
to
my
father
*NL*
without
the
slightest
foundation
?
He
never
squandered
the
funds
of
his
*NL*
company
nor
ill-treated
his
subordinates
,
I
am
absolutely
certain
of
it
;
*NL*
I
can
not
imagine
how
you
could
bring
yourself
to
write
such
a
calumny
!
*NL*
But
your
assertions
concerning
Pavlicheff
are
absolutely
intolerable
!
*NL*
You
do
not
scruple
to
make
a
libertine
of
that
noble
man
;
you
call
him
a
*NL*
sensualist
as
coolly
as
if
you
were
speaking
the
truth
,
and
yet
it
would
*NL*
not
be
possible
to
find
a
chaster
man
.
He
was
even
a
scholar
of
note
,
*NL*
and
in
correspondence
with
several
celebrated
scientists
,
and
spent
*NL*
large
sums
in
the
interests
of
science
.
As
to
his
kind
heart
and
his
*NL*
good
actions
,
you
were
right
indeed
when
you
said
that
I
was
almost
an
*NL*
idiot
at
that
time
,
and
could
hardly
understand
anything
--
-LRB-
I
could
*NL*
speak
and
understand
Russian
,
though
-RRB-
,
--
but
now
I
can
appreciate
what
I
*NL*
remember
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
''
interrupted
Hippolyte
,
``
is
not
this
rather
sentimental
?
You
*NL*
said
you
wished
to
come
to
the
point
;
please
remember
that
it
is
after
*NL*
nine
o'clock

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
gentlemen
--
very
well
,
''
replied
the
prince
.
``
At
first
I
*NL*
received
the
news
with
mistrust
,
then
I
said
to
myself
that
I
might
be
*NL*
mistaken
,
and
that
Pavlicheff
might
possibly
have
had
a
son
.
But
I
was
*NL*
absolutely
amazed
at
the
readiness
with
which
the
son
had
revealed
*NL*
the
secret
of
his
birth
at
the
expense
of
his
mother
's
honour
.
For
*NL*
Tchebaroff
had
already
menaced
me
with
publicity
in
our
interview

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
nonsense

Lebedeff

nephew
interrupted
violently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
no
right

you
have
no
right

cried
Burdovsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
son
is
not
responsible
for
the
misdeeds
of
his

and
the
*NL*
mother
is
not
to
blame

added
Hippolyte
,
with
warmth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
seems
to
me
all
the
more
reason
for
sparing
her

said
the
prince
*NL*
timidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Prince
,
you
are
not
only
simple
,
but
your
simplicity
is
almost
past
the
*NL*
limit

''
said
Lebedeff
's
nephew
,
with
a
sarcastic
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
right
had
you
?
''
said
Hippolyte
in
a
very
strange
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
None
--
none
whatever
,
''
agreed
the
prince
hastily
.
``
I
admit
you
are
right
*NL*
there
,
but
it
was
involuntary
,
and
I
immediately
said
to
myself
that
my
*NL*
personal
feelings
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
,
--
that
if
I
thought
it
right
*NL*
to
satisfy
the
demands
of
Mr.
Burdovsky
,
out
of
respect
for
the
memory
*NL*
of
Pavlicheff
,
I
ought
to
do
so
in
any
case
,
whether
I
esteemed
Mr.
*NL*
Burdovsky
or
not
.
I
only
mentioned
this
,
gentlemen
,
because
it
seemed
so
*NL*
unnatural
to
me
for
a
son
to
betray
his
mother
's
secret
in
such
a
way
.
*NL*
In
short
,
that
is
what
convinced
me
that
Tchebaroff
must
be
a
rogue
,
and
*NL*
that
he
had
induced
Mr.
Burdovsky
to
attempt
this
fraud
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
this
is
intolerable

cried
the
visitors
,
some
of
them
starting
to
*NL*
their
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
I
supposed
from
this
that
poor
Mr.
Burdovsky
must
be
a
*NL*
simple-minded
man
,
quite
defenceless
,
and
an
easy
tool
in
the
hands
*NL*
of
rogues

That
is
why
I
thought
it
my
duty
to
try
and
help
him
*NL*
as
`
Pavlicheff
's
son
'
;
in
the
first
place
by
rescuing
him
from
the
*NL*
influence
of
Tchebaroff
,
and
secondly
by
making
myself
his
friend
.
I
*NL*
have
resolved
to
give
him
ten
thousand
roubles
;
that
is
about
the
sum
*NL*
which
I
calculate
that
Pavlicheff
must
have
spent
on
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
What

only
ten
thousand

cried
Hippolyte

said
Lebedeff

whispered
the

eagerly

leaning
past
the
back
of

Hippolyte

chair
to
give
his

this
piece
of
advice

such
scorn

especially
this
fine

*NL*
-LRB-
pointing
to
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
-RRB-
``
whom
I
have
not
the
honour

I
think
I
have
heard
some
talk

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
,
really
,
gentlemen
,
''
cried
the
prince
in
great
agitation
,
``
you
*NL*
are
misunderstanding
me
again
.
In
the
first
place
,
Mr.
Keller
,
you
have
*NL*
greatly
overestimated
my
fortune
in
your
article
.
I
am
far
from
being
*NL*
a
millionaire
.
I
have
barely
a
tenth
of
what
you
suppose
.
Secondly
,
my
*NL*
treatment
in
Switzerland
was
very
far
from
costing
tens
of
thousands
of
*NL*
roubles
.
Schneider
received
six
hundred
roubles
a
year
,
and
he
was
*NL*
only
paid
for
the
first
three
years
.
As
to
the
pretty
governesses
whom
*NL*
Pavlicheff
is
supposed
to
have
brought
from
Paris
,
they
only
exist
*NL*
in
Mr.
Keller
's
imagination
;
it
is
another
calumny
.
According
to
my
*NL*
calculations
,
the
sum
spent
on
me
was
very
considerably
under
ten
*NL*
thousand
roubles
,
but
I
decided
on
that
sum
,
and
you
must
admit
that
*NL*
in
paying
a
debt
I
could
not
offer
Mr.
Burdovsky
more
,
however
kindly
*NL*
disposed
I
might
be
towards
him
;
delicacy
forbids
it
;
I
should
seem
to
*NL*
be
offering
him
charity
instead
of
rightful
payment
.
I
do
n't
know
how
*NL*
you
can
not
see
that
,
gentlemen
!
Besides
,
I
had
no
intention
of
leaving
*NL*
the
matter
there
.
I
meant
to
intervene
amicably
later
on
and
help
to
*NL*
improve
poor
Mr.
Burdovsky
's
position
.
It
is
clear
that
he
has
been
*NL*
deceived
,
or
he
would
never
have
agreed
to
anything
so
vile
as
the
*NL*
scandalous
revelations
about
his
mother
in
Mr.
Keller
's
article
.
But
,
*NL*
gentlemen
,
why
are
you
getting
angry
again
?
Are
we
never
to
come
to
an
*NL*
understanding
?
Well
,
the
event
has
proved
me
right
!
I
have
just
seen
*NL*
with
my
own
eyes
the
proof
that
my
conjecture
was
correct
!
''
he
added
,
*NL*
with
increasing
eagerness
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
meant
to
calm
his
hearers
,
and
did
not
perceive
that
his
words
had
*NL*
only
increased
their
irritation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
What
are
you
convinced
of
?
''
they
demanded
angrily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
first
place
,
I
have
had
the
opportunity
of
getting
a
correct
*NL*
idea
of
Mr.
Burdovsky
.
I
see
what
he
is
for
myself
.
He
is
an
innocent
*NL*
man
,
deceived
by
everyone
!
A
defenceless
victim
,
who
deserves
*NL*
indulgence
!
Secondly
,
Gavrila
Ardalionovitch
,
in
whose
hands
I
had
*NL*
placed
the
matter
,
had
his
first
interview
with
me
barely
an
hour
ago
.
*NL*
I
had
not
heard
from
him
for
some
time
,
as
I
was
away
,
and
have
been
ill
*NL*
for
three
days
since
my
return
to
St.
Petersburg
.
He
tells
me
that
he
*NL*
has
exposed
the
designs
of
Tchebaroff
and
has
proof
that
justifies
my
*NL*
opinion
of
him
.
I
know
,
gentlemen
,
that
many
people
think
me
an
idiot
.
*NL*
Counting
upon
my
reputation
as
a
man
whose
purse-strings
are
easily
*NL*
loosened
,
Tchebaroff
thought
it
would
be
a
simple
matter
to
fleece
me
,
*NL*
especially
by
trading
on
my
gratitude
to
Pavlicheff
.
But
the
main
*NL*
point
is
--
listen
,
gentlemen
,
let
me
finish
!
--
the
main
point
is
that
Mr.
*NL*
Burdovsky
is
not
Pavlicheff
's
son
at
all
.
Gavrila
Ardalionovitch
has
*NL*
just
told
me
of
his
discovery
,
and
assures
me
that
he
has
positive
*NL*
proofs
.
Well
,
what
do
you
think
of
that
?
It
is
scarcely
credible
,
even
*NL*
after
all
the
tricks
that
have
been
played
upon
me
.
Please
note
that
we
*NL*
have
positive
proofs
!
I
can
hardly
believe
it
myself
,
I
assure
you
;
I
do
*NL*
not
yet
believe
it
;
I
am
still
doubtful
,
because
Gavrila
Ardalionovitch
*NL*
has
not
had
time
to
go
into
details
;
but
there
can
be
no
further
doubt
*NL*
that
Tchebaroff
is
a
rogue
!
He
has
deceived
poor
Mr.
Burdovsky
,
and
*NL*
all
of
you
,
gentlemen
,
who
have
come
forward
so
nobly
to
support
your
*NL*
friend
--
-LRB-
he
evidently
needs
support
,
I
quite
see
that
!
-RRB-
.
He
has
abused
*NL*
your
credulity
and
involved
you
all
in
an
attempted
fraud
,
for
when
all
*NL*
is
said
and
done
this
claim
is
nothing
else
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
a
fraud
?
What
,
he
is
not
Pavlicheff
's
son
?
Impossible
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
exclamations
but
feebly
expressed
the
profound
bewilderment
into
*NL*
which
the
prince
's
words
had
plunged
Burdovsky
's
companions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
it
is
a
fraud
!
Since
Mr.
Burdovsky
is
not
Pavlicheff
's
son
,
*NL*
his
claim
is
neither
more
nor
less
than
attempted
fraud
-LRB-
supposing
,
of
*NL*
course
,
that
he
had
known
the
truth
-RRB-
,
but
the
fact
is
that
he
has
been
*NL*
deceived
.
I
insist
on
this
point
in
order
to
justify
him
;
I
repeat
that
*NL*
his
simple-mindedness
makes
him
worthy
of
pity
,
and
that
he
can
not
stand
*NL*
alone
;
otherwise
he
would
have
behaved
like
a
scoundrel
in
this
matter
.
*NL*
But
I
feel
certain
that
he
does
not
understand
it
!
I
was
just
the
same
*NL*
myself
before
I
went
to
Switzerland
;
I
stammered
incoherently
;
one
tries
*NL*
to
express
oneself
and
can
not
.
I
understand
that
.
I
am
all
the
better
*NL*
able
to
pity
Mr.
Burdovsky
,
because
I
know
from
experience
what
it
is
to
*NL*
be
like
that
,
and
so
I
have
a
right
to
speak
.
Well
,
though
there
is
no
*NL*
such
person
as
`
Pavlicheff
's
son
,
'
and
it
is
all
nothing
but
a
humbug
,
*NL*
yet
I
will
keep
to
my
decision
,
and
I
am
prepared
to
give
up
ten
*NL*
thousand
roubles
in
memory
of
Pavlicheff
.
Before
Mr.
Burdovsky
made
this
*NL*
claim
,
I
proposed
to
found
a
school
with
this
money
,
in
memory
of
my
*NL*
benefactor
,
but
I
shall
honour
his
memory
quite
as
well
by
giving
*NL*
the
ten
thousand
roubles
to
Mr.
Burdovsky
,
because
,
though
he
was
not
*NL*
Pavlicheff
's
son
,
he
was
treated
almost
as
though
he
were
.
That
is
*NL*
what
gave
a
rogue
the
opportunity
of
deceiving
him
;
he
really
did
*NL*
think
himself
Pavlicheff
's
son
.
Listen
,
gentlemen
;
this
matter
must
*NL*
be
settled
;
keep
calm
;
do
not
get
angry
;
and
sit
down
!
Gavrila
*NL*
Ardalionovitch
will
explain
everything
to
you
at
once
,
and
I
confess
*NL*
that
I
am
very
anxious
to
hear
all
the
details
myself
.
He
says
that
he
*NL*
has
even
been
to
Pskoff
to
see
your
mother
,
Mr.
Burdovsky
;
she
is
not
*NL*
dead
,
as
the
article
which
was
just
read
to
us
makes
out
.
Sit
down
,
*NL*
gentlemen
,
sit
down
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
sat
down
,
and
at
length
prevailed
upon
Burdovsky
's
company
*NL*
to
do
likewise
.
During
the
last
ten
or
twenty
minutes
,
exasperated
by
*NL*
continual
interruptions
,
he
had
raised
his
voice
,
and
spoken
with
*NL*
great
vehemence
.
Now
,
no
doubt
,
he
bitterly
regretted
several
words
and
*NL*
expressions
which
had
escaped
him
in
his
excitement
.
If
he
had
not
been
*NL*
driven
beyond
the
limits
of
endurance
,
he
would
not
have
ventured
to
*NL*
express
certain
conjectures
so
openly
.
He
had
no
sooner
sat
down
than
*NL*
his
heart
was
torn
by
sharp
remorse
.
Besides
insulting
Burdovsky
*NL*
with
the
supposition
,
made
in
the
presence
of
witnesses
,
that
he
was
*NL*
suffering
from
the
complaint
for
which
he
had
himself
been
treated
*NL*
in
Switzerland
,
he
reproached
himself
with
the
grossest
indelicacy
in
*NL*
having
offered
him
the
ten
thousand
roubles
before
everyone
.
``
I
ought
*NL*
to
have
waited
till
to-morrow
and
offered
him
the
money
when
we
were
*NL*
alone
,
''
thought
Muishkin
.
``
Now
it
is
too
late
,
the
mischief
is
done
!
*NL*
Yes
,
I
am
an
idiot
,
an
absolute
idiot
!
''
he
said
to
himself
,
overcome
*NL*
with
shame
and
regret
.
*NL*
*NL*
Till
then
Gavrila
Ardalionovitch
had
sat
apart
in
silence
.
When
the
*NL*
prince
called
upon
him
,
he
came
and
stood
by
his
side
,
and
in
a
calm
,
*NL*
clear
voice
began
to
render
an
account
of
the
mission
confided
to
him
.
*NL*
All
conversation
ceased
instantly
.
Everyone
,
especially
the
Burdovsky
*NL*
party
,
listened
with
the
utmost
curiosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
IX
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
not
deny
,
I
am
sure
,
''
said
Gavrila
Ardalionovitch
,
turning
*NL*
to
Burdovsky
,
who
sat
looking
at
him
with
wide-open
eyes
,
perplexed
and
*NL*
astonished
.
You
will
not
deny
,
seriously
,
that
you
were
born
just
two
*NL*
years
after
your
mother
's
legal
marriage
to
Mr.
Burdovsky
,
your
father
.
*NL*
Nothing
would
be
easier
than
to
prove
the
date
of
your
birth
from
*NL*
well-known
facts
;
we
can
only
look
on
Mr.
Keller
's
version
as
a
work
of
*NL*
imagination
,
and
one
,
moreover
,
extremely
offensive
both
to
you
and
your
*NL*
mother
.
Of
course
he
distorted
the
truth
in
order
to
strengthen
your
*NL*
claim
,
and
to
serve
your
interests
.
Mr.
Keller
said
that
he
previously
*NL*
consulted
you
about
his
article
in
the
paper
,
but
did
not
read
it
to
you
*NL*
as
a
whole
.
Certainly
he
could
not
have
read
that
passage
.
...
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
a
matter
of
fact
,
I
did
not
read
it
,
''
interrupted
the
boxer
,
``
but
*NL*
its
contents
had
been
given
me
on
unimpeachable
authority
,
and
I.
.
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
Mr.
Keller
,
''
interposed
Gavrila
Ardalionovitch
.
``
Allow
me
to
*NL*
speak
.
I
assure
you
your
article
shall
be
mentioned
in
its
proper
place
,
*NL*
and
you
can
then
explain
everything
,
but
for
the
moment
I
would
rather
*NL*
not
anticipate
.
Quite
accidentally
,
with
the
help
of
my
sister
,
Varvara
*NL*
Ardalionovna
Ptitsin
,
I
obtained
from
one
of
her
intimate
friends
,
*NL*
Madame
Zoubkoff
,
a
letter
written
to
her
twenty-five
years
ago
,
*NL*
by
Nicolai
Andreevitch
Pavlicheff
,
then
abroad
.
After
getting
*NL*
into
communication
with
this
lady
,
I
went
by
her
advice
to
Timofei
*NL*
Fedorovitch
Viazovkin
,
a
retired
colonel
,
and
one
of
Pavlicheff
's
oldest
*NL*
friends
.
He
gave
me
two
more
letters
written
by
the
latter
when
he
was
*NL*
still
in
foreign
parts
.
These
three
documents
,
their
dates
,
and
the
*NL*
facts
mentioned
in
them
,
prove
in
the
most
undeniable
manner
,
that
*NL*
eighteen
months
before
your
birth
,
Nicolai
Andreevitch
went
abroad
,
*NL*
where
he
remained
for
three
consecutive
years
.
Your
mother
,
as
you
are
*NL*
well
aware
,
has
never
been
out
of
Russia
...
It
is
too
late
to
read
the
*NL*
letters
now
;
I
am
content
to
state
the
fact
.
But
if
you
desire
it
,
come
*NL*
to
me
tomorrow
morning
,
bring
witnesses
and
writing
experts
with
you
,
*NL*
and
I
will
prove
the
absolute
truth
of
my
story
.
From
that
moment
the
*NL*
question
will
be
decided
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
words
caused
a
sensation
among
the
listeners
,
and
there
was
a
*NL*
general
movement
of
relief
.
Burdovsky
got
up
abruptly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
that
is
true
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
have
been
deceived
,
grossly
deceived
,
but
*NL*
not
by
Tchebaroff
:
and
for
a
long
time
past
,
a
long
time
.
I
do
not
*NL*
wish
for
experts
,
not
I
,
nor
to
go
to
see
you
.
I
believe
you
.
I
give
it
*NL*
up
...
But
I
refuse
the
ten
thousand
roubles
.
Good-bye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
five
minutes
more
,
Mr.
Burdovsky
,
''
said
Gavrila
Ardalionovitch
*NL*
pleasantly
.
``
I
have
more
to
say
.
Some
rather
curious
and
important
facts
*NL*
have
come
to
light
,
and
it
is
absolutely
necessary
,
in
my
opinion
,
that
*NL*
you
should
hear
them
.
You
will
not
regret
,
I
fancy
,
to
have
the
whole
*NL*
matter
thoroughly
cleared
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Burdovsky
silently
resumed
his
seat
,
and
bent
his
head
as
though
in
*NL*
profound
thought
.
His
friend
,
Lebedeff
's
nephew
,
who
had
risen
to
*NL*
accompany
him
,
also
sat
down
again
.
He
seemed
much
disappointed
,
though
*NL*
as
self-confident
as
ever
.
Hippolyte
looked
dejected
and
sulky
,
as
well
*NL*
as
surprised
.
He
had
just
been
attacked
by
a
violent
fit
of
coughing
,
*NL*
so
that
his
handkerchief
was
stained
with
blood
.
The
boxer
looked
*NL*
thoroughly
frightened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Antip
!
''
cried
he
in
a
miserable
voice
,
``
I
did
say
to
you
the
*NL*
other
day
--
the
day
before
yesterday
--
that
perhaps
you
were
not
really
*NL*
Pavlicheff
's
son
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
sounds
of
half-smothered
laughter
at
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
that
is
a
valuable
piece
of
information
,
Mr.
Keller
,
''
replied
*NL*
Gania
.
``
However
that
may
be
,
I
have
private
information
which
convinces
*NL*
me
that
Mr.
Burdovsky
,
though
doubtless
aware
of
the
date
of
his
birth
,
*NL*
knew
nothing
at
all
about
Pavlicheff
's
sojourn
abroad
.
Indeed
,
he
passed
*NL*
the
greater
part
of
his
life
out
of
Russia
,
returning
at
intervals
for
*NL*
short
visits
.
The
journey
in
question
is
in
itself
too
unimportant
for
*NL*
his
friends
to
recollect
it
after
more
than
twenty
years
;
and
of
course
*NL*
Mr.
Burdovsky
could
have
known
nothing
about
it
,
for
he
was
not
born
.
*NL*
As
the
event
has
proved
,
it
was
not
impossible
to
find
evidence
of
his
*NL*
absence
,
though
I
must
confess
that
chance
has
helped
me
in
a
quest
*NL*
which
might
very
well
have
come
to
nothing
.
It
was
really
almost
*NL*
impossible
for
Burdovsky
or
Tchebaroff
to
discover
these
facts
,
even
if
*NL*
it
had
entered
their
heads
to
try
.
Naturally
they
never
dreamt
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
voice
of
Hippolyte
suddenly
intervened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Allow
me
,
Mr.
Ivolgin
,
''
he
said
irritably
.
``
What
is
the
good
of
all
*NL*
this
rigmarole
?
Pardon
me
.
All
is
now
clear
,
and
we
acknowledge
the
*NL*
truth
of
your
main
point
.
Why
go
into
these
tedious
details
?
You
wish
*NL*
perhaps
to
boast
of
the
cleverness
of
your
investigation
,
to
cry
up
your
*NL*
talents
as
detective
?
Or
perhaps
your
intention
is
to
excuse
Burdovsky
,
*NL*
by
roving
that
he
took
up
the
matter
in
ignorance
?
Well
,
I
consider
that
*NL*
extremely
impudent
on
your
part
!
You
ought
to
know
that
Burdovsky
has
*NL*
no
need
of
being
excused
or
justified
by
you
or
anyone
else
!
It
is
an
*NL*
insult
!
The
affair
is
quite
painful
enough
for
him
without
that
.
Will
*NL*
nothing
make
you
understand
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Enough
!
enough
!
Mr.
Terentieff
,
''
interrupted
Gania
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
excite
yourself
;
you
seem
very
ill
,
and
I
am
sorry
for
that
.
I
am
*NL*
almost
done
,
but
there
are
a
few
facts
to
which
I
must
briefly
refer
,
as
*NL*
I
am
convinced
that
they
ought
to
be
clearly
explained
once
for
all
...
''
*NL*
A
movement
of
impatience
was
noticed
in
his
audience
as
he
resumed
:
``
I
*NL*
merely
wish
to
state
,
for
the
information
of
all
concerned
,
that
the
*NL*
reason
for
Mr.
Pavlicheff
's
interest
in
your
mother
,
Mr.
Burdovsky
,
was
*NL*
simply
that
she
was
the
sister
of
a
serf-girl
with
whom
he
was
deeply
in
*NL*
love
in
his
youth
,
and
whom
most
certainly
he
would
have
married
but
for
*NL*
her
sudden
death
.
I
have
proofs
that
this
circumstance
is
almost
,
if
not
*NL*
quite
,
forgotten
.
I
may
add
that
when
your
mother
was
about
ten
years
*NL*
old
,
Pavlicheff
took
her
under
his
care
,
gave
her
a
good
education
,
and
*NL*
later
,
a
considerable
dowry
.
His
relations
were
alarmed
,
and
feared
*NL*
he
might
go
so
far
as
to
marry
her
,
but
she
gave
her
hand
to
a
young
*NL*
land-surveyor
named
Burdovsky
when
she
reached
the
age
of
twenty
.
I
*NL*
can
even
say
definitely
that
it
was
a
marriage
of
affection
.
After
his
*NL*
wedding
your
father
gave
up
his
occupation
as
land-surveyor
,
and
with
*NL*
his
wife
's
dowry
of
fifteen
thousand
roubles
went
in
for
commercial
*NL*
speculations
.
As
he
had
had
no
experience
,
he
was
cheated
on
all
sides
,
*NL*
and
took
to
drink
in
order
to
forget
his
troubles
.
He
shortened
his
life
*NL*
by
his
excesses
,
and
eight
years
after
his
marriage
he
died
.
Your
mother
*NL*
says
herself
that
she
was
left
in
the
direst
poverty
,
and
would
have
*NL*
died
of
starvation
had
it
not
been
for
Pavlicheff
,
who
generously
*NL*
allowed
her
a
yearly
pension
of
six
hundred
roubles
.
Many
people
recall
*NL*
his
extreme
fondness
for
you
as
a
little
boy
.
Your
mother
confirms
this
,
*NL*
and
agrees
with
others
in
thinking
that
he
loved
you
the
more
because
*NL*
you
were
a
sickly
child
,
stammering
in
your
speech
,
and
almost
*NL*
deformed
--
for
it
is
known
that
all
his
life
Nicolai
Andreevitch
had
a
*NL*
partiality
for
unfortunates
of
every
kind
,
especially
children
.
In
my
*NL*
opinion
this
is
most
important
.
I
may
add
that
I
discovered
yet
another
*NL*
fact
,
the
last
on
which
I
employed
my
detective
powers
.
Seeing
how
fond
*NL*
Pavlicheff
was
of
you
,
--
it
was
thanks
to
him
you
went
to
school
,
and
*NL*
also
had
the
advantage
of
special
teachers
--
his
relations
and
servants
*NL*
grew
to
believe
that
you
were
his
son
,
and
that
your
father
had
been
*NL*
betrayed
by
his
wife
.
I
may
point
out
that
this
idea
was
only
accredited
*NL*
generally
during
the
last
years
of
Pavlicheff
's
life
,
when
his
*NL*
next-of-kin
were
trembling
about
the
succession
,
when
the
earlier
story
*NL*
was
quite
forgotten
,
and
when
all
opportunity
for
discovering
the
truth
*NL*
had
seemingly
passed
away
.
No
doubt
you
,
Mr.
Burdovsky
,
heard
this
*NL*
conjecture
,
and
did
not
hesitate
to
accept
it
as
true
.
I
have
had
the
*NL*
honour
of
making
your
mother
's
acquaintance
,
and
I
find
that
she
knows
*NL*
all
about
these
reports
.
What
she
does
not
know
is
that
you
,
her
son
,
*NL*
should
have
listened
to
them
so
complaisantly
.
I
found
your
respected
*NL*
mother
at
Pskoff
,
ill
and
in
deep
poverty
,
as
she
has
been
ever
since
*NL*
the
death
of
your
benefactor
.
She
told
me
with
tears
of
gratitude
how
*NL*
you
had
supported
her
;
she
expects
much
of
you
,
and
believes
fervently
*NL*
in
your
future
success
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
this
is
unbearable
!
''
said
Lebedeff
's
nephew
impatiently
.
``
What
is
*NL*
the
good
of
all
this
romancing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
revolting
and
unseemly
!
''
cried
Hippolyte
,
jumping
up
in
a
fury
.
*NL*
*NL*
Burdovsky
alone
sat
silent
and
motionless
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
good
of
it
?
''
repeated
Gavrila
Ardalionovitch
,
with
*NL*
pretended
surprise
.
``
Well
,
firstly
,
because
now
perhaps
Mr.
Burdovsky
*NL*
is
quite
convinced
that
Mr.
Pavlicheff
's
love
for
him
came
simply
from
*NL*
generosity
of
soul
,
and
not
from
paternal
duty
.
It
was
most
necessary
*NL*
to
impress
this
fact
upon
his
mind
,
considering
that
he
approved
of
the
*NL*
article
written
by
Mr.
Keller
.
I
speak
thus
because
I
look
on
you
,
Mr.
*NL*
Burdovsky
,
as
an
honourable
man
.
Secondly
,
it
appears
that
there
was
no
*NL*
intention
of
cheating
in
this
case
,
even
on
the
part
of
Tchebaroff
.
I
*NL*
wish
to
say
this
quite
plainly
,
because
the
prince
hinted
a
while
*NL*
ago
that
I
too
thought
it
an
attempt
at
robbery
and
extortion
.
On
the
*NL*
contrary
,
everyone
has
been
quite
sincere
in
the
matter
,
and
although
*NL*
Tchebaroff
may
be
somewhat
of
a
rogue
,
in
this
business
he
has
acted
*NL*
simply
as
any
sharp
lawyer
would
do
under
the
circumstances
.
He
looked
*NL*
at
it
as
a
case
that
might
bring
him
in
a
lot
of
money
,
and
he
did
not
*NL*
calculate
badly
;
because
on
the
one
hand
he
speculated
on
the
generosity
*NL*
of
the
prince
,
and
his
gratitude
to
the
late
Mr.
Pavlicheff
,
and
on
*NL*
the
other
to
his
chivalrous
ideas
as
to
the
obligations
of
honour
and
*NL*
conscience
.
As
to
Mr.
Burdovsky
,
allowing
for
his
principles
,
we
may
*NL*
acknowledge
that
he
engaged
in
the
business
with
very
little
personal
*NL*
aim
in
view
.
At
the
instigation
of
Tchebaroff
and
his
other
friends
,
*NL*
he
decided
to
make
the
attempt
in
the
service
of
truth
,
progress
,
and
*NL*
humanity
.
In
short
,
the
conclusion
may
be
drawn
that
,
in
spite
of
all
*NL*
appearances
,
Mr.
Burdovsky
is
a
man
of
irreproachable
character
,
and
*NL*
thus
the
prince
can
all
the
more
readily
offer
him
his
friendship
,
and
*NL*
the
assistance
of
which
he
spoke
just
now
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
!
hush
!
Gavrila
Ardalionovitch
!
''
cried
Muishkin
in
dismay
,
but
it
*NL*
was
too
late
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
said
,
and
I
have
repeated
it
over
and
over
again
,
''
shouted
Burdovsky
*NL*
furiously
,
``
that
I
did
not
want
the
money
.
I
will
not
take
it
...
why
...
I
*NL*
will
not

I
am
going
away
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
rushing
hurriedly
from
the
terrace
,
when
Lebedeff
's
nephew
seized
*NL*
his
arms
,
and
said
something
to
him
in
a
low
voice
.
Burdovsky
turned
*NL*
quickly
,
and
drawing
an
addressed
but
unsealed
envelope
from
his
pocket
,
*NL*
he
threw
it
down
on
a
little
table
beside
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
the
money
!
...
How
dare
you
?
...
The
money
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Those
are
the
two
hundred
and
fifty
roubles
you
dared
to
send
him
as
a
*NL*
charity
,
by
the
hands
of
Tchebaroff
,

explained
Doktorenko
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
article
in
the
newspaper
put
it
at
fifty

''
cried
Colia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
''
said
the
prince
,
going
up
to
Burdovsky
.
``
I
have
*NL*
done
you
a
great
wrong
,
but
I
did
not
send
you
that
money
as
a
charity

*NL*
believe
me
.
And
now
I
am
again
to
blame
.
I
offended
you
just
now
.
''
-LRB-
The
*NL*
prince
was
much
distressed
;
he
seemed
worn
out
with
fatigue
,
and
spoke
*NL*
almost
incoherently
.
-RRB-
``
I
spoke
of
swindling
...
but
I
did
not
apply
that
*NL*
to
you
.
I
was
deceived

I
said
you
were

afflicted
...
like
me
...
*NL*
But
you
are
not
like
me
...
you
give
lessons
...
you
support
your

*NL*
I
said
you
had
dishonoured
your
mother
,
but
you
love
her
.
She
says
so
*NL*
herself
...
I
did
not
know

Gavrila
Ardalionovitch
did
not
tell
me
*NL*
that
...
Forgive
me
!
I
dared
to
offer
you
ten
thousand
roubles
,
but
I
was
*NL*
wrong
.
I
ought
to
have
done
it
differently
,
and
now
...
there
is
no
way
*NL*
of
doing
it
,
for
you
despise
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
declare
,
this
is
a
lunatic
asylum

cried
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
it
is
a
lunatic
asylum
!
''
repeated
Aglaya
sharply
,
but
her
*NL*
words
were
overpowered
by
other
voices
.
Everybody
was
talking
loudly
,
*NL*
making
remarks
and
comments
;
some
discussed
the
affair
gravely
,
others
*NL*
laughed
.
Ivan
Fedorovitch
Epanchin
was
extremely
indignant
.
He
stood
*NL*
waiting
for
his
wife
with
an
air
of
offended
dignity
.
Lebedeff
's
nephew
*NL*
took
up
the
word
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
prince
,
to
do
you
justice
,
you
certainly
know
how
to
make
the
*NL*
most
of
your
--
let
us
call
it
infirmity
,
for
the
sake
of
politeness
;
you
*NL*
have
set
about
offering
your
money
and
friendship
in
such
a
way
that
*NL*
no
self-respecting
man
could
possibly
accept
them
.
This
is
an
excess
of
*NL*
ingenuousness
or
of
malice
--
you
ought
to
know
better
than
anyone
which
*NL*
word
best
fits
the
case
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Allow
me
,
gentlemen
,
''
said
Gavrila
Ardalionovitch
,
who
had
just
*NL*
examined
the
contents
of
the
envelope
,
``
there
are
only
a
hundred
roubles
*NL*
here
,
not
two
hundred
and
fifty
.
I
point
this
out

prince
,
to
prevent
*NL*
misunderstanding
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
,
never
mind

''
said
the
prince
,
signing
to
him
to
keep
quiet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
we
do
mind

said
Lebedeff
's
nephew
vehemently
.
``
Prince
,
your
*NL*
`
never
mind
'
is
an
insult
to
us
.
We
have
nothing
to
hide
;
our
actions
*NL*
can
bear
daylight
.
It
is
true
that
there
are
only
a
hundred
roubles
*NL*
instead
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
,
but
it
is
all
the
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
no
,
it
is
hardly
the
same
,
''
remarked
Gavrila
Ardalionovitch
,
with
*NL*
an
air
of
ingenuous
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
interrupt
,
we
are
not
such
fools
as
you
think
,
Mr.
Lawyer
,
''
cried
*NL*
Lebedeff
's
nephew
angrily
.
``
Of
course
there
is
a
difference
between
*NL*
a
hundred
roubles
and
two
hundred
and
fifty
,
but
in
this
case
the
*NL*
principle
is
the
main
point
,
and
that
a
hundred
and
fifty
roubles
*NL*
are
missing
is
only
a
side
issue
.
The
point
to
be
emphasized
is
that
*NL*
Burdovsky
will
not
accept
your
highness
's
charity
;
he
flings
it
back
in
*NL*
your
face
,
and
it
scarcely
matters
if
there
are
a
hundred
roubles
or
two
*NL*
hundred
and
fifty
.
Burdovsky
has
refused
ten
thousand
roubles
;
you
*NL*
heard
him
.
He
would
not
have
returned
even
a
hundred
roubles
if
he
was
*NL*
dishonest
!
The
hundred
and
fifty
roubles
were
paid
to
Tchebaroff
for
*NL*
his
travelling
expenses
.
You
may
jeer
at
our
stupidity
and
at
our
*NL*
inexperience
in
business
matters
;
you
have
done
all
you
could
already
to
*NL*
make
us
look
ridiculous
;
but
do
not
dare
to
call
us
dishonest
.
The
*NL*
four
of
us
will
club
together
every
day
to
repay
the
hundred
and
fifty
*NL*
roubles
to
the
prince
,
if
we
have
to
pay
it
in
instalments
of
a
rouble
*NL*
at
a
time
,
but
we
will
repay
it
,
with
interest
.
Burdovsky
is
poor
,
he
*NL*
has
no
millions
.
After
his
journey
to
see
the
prince
Tchebaroff
sent
in
*NL*
his
bill
.
We
counted
on
winning

Who
would
not
have
done
the
same
in
*NL*
such
a
case

*NL*
*NL*
``
Who

exclaimed
Prince

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
certainly
go
mad

cried
Lizabetha
Prokofievna

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
reminds
me

said
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
,
laughing
,
``
of
the
famous
plea

He
excused
his

*NL*

quite
natural

he
said
in

was
in

that

Those

can

through

all
your

and
graces

I
see
your
game

*NL*
*NL*
``
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
!
''
exclaimed
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
,
it
is
quite
time
for
us
to
be
going
,
*NL*
we
will
take
the
prince
with
us
,
''
said
Prince
S.
with
a
smile
,
in
the
*NL*
coolest
possible
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
girls
stood
apart
,
almost
frightened
;
their
father
was
positively
*NL*
horrified
.
Mrs.
Epanchin
's
language
astonished
everybody
.
Some
who
stood
*NL*
a
little
way
off
smiled
furtively
,
and
talked
in
whispers
.
Lebedeff
wore
*NL*
an
expression
of
utmost
ecstasy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Chaos
and
scandal
are
to
be
found
everywhere
,
madame
,
''
remarked
*NL*
Doktorenko
,
who
was
considerably
put
out
of
countenance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
like
this
!
Nothing
like
the
spectacle
you
have
just
given
us
,
sir
,
''
*NL*
answered
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
,
with
a
sort
of
hysterical
rage
.
``
Leave
*NL*
me
alone
,
will
you
?
''
she
cried
violently
to
those
around
her
,
who
were
*NL*
trying
to
keep
her
quiet
.
``
No
,
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
,
if
,
as
you
said
*NL*
yourself
just
now
,
a
lawyer
said
in
open
court
that
he
found
it
quite
*NL*
natural
that
a
man
should
murder
six
people
because
he
was
in
misery
,
*NL*
the
world
must
be
coming
to
an
end
.
I
had
not
heard
of
it
before
.
Now
*NL*
I
understand
everything
.
And
this
stutterer
,
wo
n't
he
turn
out
a
*NL*
murderer
?
''
she
cried
,
pointing
to
Burdovsky
,
who
was
staring
at
her
with
*NL*
stupefaction
.
``
I
bet
he
will
!
He
will
have
none
of
your
money
,
possibly
,
*NL*
he
will
refuse
it
because
his
conscience
will
not
allow
him
to
accept
*NL*
it
,
but
he
will
go
murdering
you
by
night
and
walking
off
with
your
*NL*
cashbox
,
with
a
clear
conscience
!
He
does
not
call
it
a
dishonest
action
*NL*
but
`
the
impulse
of
a
noble
despair
'
;
'
a
negation
'
;
or
the
devil
knows
*NL*
what
!
Bah
!
everything
is
upside
down
,
everyone
walks
head
downwards
.
A
*NL*
young
girl
,
brought
up
at
home
,
suddenly
jumps
into
a
cab
in
the
*NL*
middle
of
the
street
,
saying
:
`
Good-bye
,
mother
,
I
married
Karlitch
,
or
*NL*
Ivanitch
,
the
other
day
!
'
And
you
think
it
quite
right
?
You
call
such
*NL*
conduct
estimable
and
natural
?
The
`
woman
question
'
?
Look
here
,
''
she
*NL*
continued
,
pointing
to
Colia
,
``
the
other
day
that
whippersnapper
told
*NL*
me
that
this
was
the
whole
meaning
of
the
`
woman
question
.
'
But
even
*NL*
supposing
that
your
mother
is
a
fool
,
you
are
none
the
less
,
bound
to
*NL*
treat
her
with
humanity
.
Why
did
you
come
here
tonight
so
insolently
?
*NL*
`
Give
us
our
rights
,
but
do
n't
dare
to
speak
in
our
presence
.
Show
us
*NL*
every
mark
of
deepest
respect
,
while
we
treat
you
like
the
scum
of
*NL*
the
earth
.
'
The
miscreants
have
written
a
tissue
of
calumny
in
their
*NL*
article
,
and
these
are
the
men
who
seek
for
truth
,
and
do
battle
for
the
*NL*
right
!
`
We
do
not
beseech
,
we
demand
,
you
will
get
no
thanks
from
*NL*
us
,
because
you
will
be
acting
to
satisfy
your
own
conscience
!
'
*NL*
What
morality
!
But
,
good
heavens
!
if
you
declare
that
the
prince
's
*NL*
generosity
will
,
excite
no
gratitude
in
you
,
he
might
answer
that
he
is
*NL*
not
,
bound
to
be
grateful
to
Pavlicheff
,
who
also
was
only
satisfying
*NL*
his
own
conscience
.
But
you
counted
on
the
prince
's
,
gratitude
towards
*NL*
Pavlicheff
;
you
never
lent
him
any
money
;
he
owes
you
nothing
;
then
what
*NL*
were
you
counting
upon
if
not
on
his
gratitude
?
And
if
you
appeal
to
*NL*
that
sentiment
in
others
,
why
should
you
expect
to
be
exempted
from
*NL*
it
?
They
are
mad
!
They
say
society
is
savage
and
inhuman
because
it
*NL*
despises
a
young
girl
who
has
been
seduced
.
But
if
you
call
society
*NL*
inhuman
you
imply
that
the
young
girl
is
made
to
suffer
by
its
censure
.
*NL*
How
then
,
can
you
hold
her
up
to
the
scorn
of
society
in
the
newspapers
*NL*
without
realizing
that
you
are
making
her
suffering
,
still
greater
?
*NL*
Madmen
!
Vain
fools
!
They
do
n't
believe
in
God
,
they
do
n't
believe
in
*NL*
Christ
!
But
you
are
so
eaten
up
by
pride
and
vanity
,
that
you
will
end
*NL*
by
devouring
each
other
--
that
is
my
prophecy
!
Is
not
this
absurd
?
Is
it
*NL*
not
monstrous
chaos
?
And
after
all
this
,
that
shameless
creature
will
*NL*
go
and
beg
their
pardon
!
Are
there
many
people
like
you
?
What
are
*NL*
you
smiling
at
?
Because
I
am
not
ashamed
to
disgrace
myself
before
*NL*
you
?
--
Yes
,
I
am
disgraced
--
it
ca
n't
be
helped
now
!
But
do
n't
you
jeer
at
*NL*
me
,
you
scum
!

turned
quickly
back

furiously

rushing
at
the

mocking

smile
drove
her
to
distraction

Exclamations
arose
on

firmly
by

were
fixed

*NL*
``

he
answered
calmly

A
violent

She
loosed
her
hold
on
his

almost
terrified
,
as
she

saw
him
wiping
the
blood
from

whispered
hoarsely

I
put

down

down

placed

for

at

once
more

out

that
in

fortnight
I
shall
I
certainly
be
no

in

So
,
in
a
way

this
is
my
farewell
to
nature

to

I
am
not
very
sentimental

do
you
know

I
am
quite
glad

*NL*
``
But

replied

more
and
more
*NL*
alarmed

``
You

quite
feverish

still
comes

You
are

original

eccentric

I
have
seen

have
even
been
rather
*NL*
fond

look

Give

cried
Lizabetha
Prokofievna

she
seized
one
for

herself
and
sat
down
opposite
to
Hippolyte

``
Colia

you
must
go
home

commanded

*NL*
``
Will

being
so
free

easy

I
know
you

kind

too

In
fact

we
are
all
good-natured

really
quite
comical

*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
bestirred
himself
to
give
orders

Lebedeff
hurried
out
,
*NL*
followed
by
Vera
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
quite
true

said
Mrs.
Epanchin
decisively

``
Talk

not
too
*NL*
loud

all
the

Nobody

*NL*
is
absurd

However
,
forgive
me
,
prince
,
if
I
blew
you
up

that
is
,
if
*NL*
you
like
,
of
course
.
But
please
do
n't
let
me
keep
anyone

''
she
added
*NL*
suddenly
to
her
husband
and
daughters
,
in
a
tone
of
resentment
,
as
*NL*
though
they
had
grievously
offended
her
.
``
I
can
come
home
alone
quite
*NL*
well

*NL*
*NL*
But
they
did
not
let
her
finish
,
and
gathered
round
her
eagerly
.
The
*NL*
prince
immediately
invited
everyone
to
stay
for
tea
,
and
apologized
*NL*
for
not
having
thought
of
it
before
.
The
general
murmured
a
few
polite
*NL*
words
,
and
asked
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
if
she
did
not
feel
cold
on
the
*NL*
terrace
.
He
very
nearly
asked
Hippolyte
how
long
he
had
been
at
the
*NL*
University
,
but
stopped
himself
in
time
.
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
and
Prince
*NL*
S.
suddenly
grew
extremely
gay
and
amiable
.
Adelaida
and
Alexandra
*NL*
had
not
recovered
from
their
surprise
,
but
it
was
now
mingled
with
*NL*
satisfaction
;
in
short
,
everyone
seemed
very
much
relieved
that
*NL*
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
had
got
over
her
paroxysm
.
Aglaya
alone
still
*NL*
frowned
,
and
sat
apart
in
silence
.
All
the
other
guests
stayed
on
as
*NL*
well
;
no
one
wanted
to
go
,
not
even
General
Ivolgin
,
but
Lebedeff
said
*NL*
something
to
him
in
passing
which
did
not
seem
to
please
him
,
for
he
*NL*
immediately
went
and
sulked
in
a
corner
.
The
prince
took
care
to
offer
*NL*
tea
to
Burdovsky
and
his
friends
as
well
as
the
rest
.
The
invitation
*NL*
made
them
rather
uncomfortable
.
They
muttered
that
they
would
wait
for
*NL*
Hippolyte
,
and
went
and
sat
by
themselves
in
a
distant
corner
of
the
*NL*
verandah
.
Tea
was
served
at
once
;
Lebedeff
had
no
doubt
ordered
it
*NL*
for
himself
and
his
family
before
the
others
arrived
.
It
was
striking
*NL*
eleven
.
*NL*
*NL*
X
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
moistening
his
lips
with
the
tea
which
Vera
Lebedeff
brought
him
,
*NL*
Hippolyte
set
the
cup
down
on
the
table
,
and
glanced
round
.
He
seemed
*NL*
confused
and
almost
at
a
loss
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
look
,
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
,
''
he
began
,
with
a
kind
of
feverish
*NL*
haste
;
``
these
china
cups
are
supposed
to
be
extremely
valuable
.
Lebedeff
*NL*
always
keeps
them
locked
up
in
his
china-cupboard
;
they
were
part
of
his
*NL*
wife
's
dowry
.
Yet
he
has
brought
them
out
tonight
--
in
your
honour
,
of
*NL*
course
!
He
is
so
pleased
--
''
He
was
about
to
add
something
else
,
but
*NL*
could
not
find
the
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
he
is
feeling
embarrassed
;
I
expected
as
much
,
''
whispered
*NL*
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
suddenly
in
the
prince
's
ear
.
``
It
is
a
bad
sign
;
*NL*
what
do
you
think
?
Now
,
out
of
spite
,
he
will
come
out
with
something
*NL*
so
outrageous
that
even
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
will
not
be
able
to
stand
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Muishkin
looked
at
him
inquiringly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
not
care
if
he
does
?
''
added
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
.
``
Neither
do
I
;
*NL*
in
fact
,
I
should
be
glad
,
merely
as
a
proper
punishment
for
our
dear
*NL*
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
.
I
am
very
anxious
that
she
should
get
it
,
without
*NL*
delay
,
and
I
shall
stay
till
she
does
.
You
seem
feverish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
;
by-and-by
;
yes
,
I
am
not
feeling
well
,
''
said
the
prince
*NL*
impatiently
,
hardly
listening
.
He
had
just
heard
Hippolyte
mention
his
*NL*
own
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
believe
it
?
''
said
the
invalid
,
with
a
nervous
laugh
.
``
I
do
n't
*NL*
wonder
,
but
the
prince
will
have
no
difficulty
in
believing
it
;
he
will
*NL*
not
be
at
all
surprised
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
hear
,
prince
--
do
you
hear
that
?
''
said
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
,
*NL*
turning
towards
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
laughter
in
the
group
around
her
,
and
Lebedeff
stood
before
*NL*
her
gesticulating
wildly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
declares
that
your
humbug
of
a
landlord
revised
this
gentleman
's
*NL*
article
--
the
article
that
was
read
aloud
just
now
--
in
which
you
got
such
*NL*
a
charming
dressing-down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
regarded
Lebedeff
with
astonishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
say
something
?
''
cried
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
,
stamping
her
*NL*
foot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
murmured
the
prince
,
with
his
eyes
still
fixed
on
Lebedeff
,
``
I
*NL*
can
see
now
that
he
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
true
?
''
she
asked
eagerly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Absolutely
,
your
excellency
,
''
said
Lebedeff
,
without
the
least
*NL*
hesitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Epanchin
almost
sprang
up
in
amazement
at
his
answer
,
and
at
the
*NL*
assurance
of
his
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
actually
seems
to
boast
of
it
!
''
she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
base
--
base
!
''
muttered
Lebedeff
,
beating
his
breast
,
and
hanging
*NL*
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
I
care
if
you
are
base

not

He
thinks
he
has
only
to
say
,
*NL*

I
am
base
,
'
and
there
is
an
end
of
it
.
As
to
you
,
prince
,
are
you
not
*NL*
ashamed
?
--
I
repeat
,
are
you
not
ashamed
,
to
mix
with
such
riff-raff
?
I
*NL*
will
never
forgive
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
prince
will
forgive
me
!
''
said
Lebedeff
with
emotional
conviction
.
*NL*
*NL*
Keller
suddenly
left
his
seat
,
and
approached
Lizabetha
.
Prokofievna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
only
out
of
generosity
,
madame
,
''
he
said
in
a
resonant
voice
,
*NL*
``
and
because
I
would
not
betray
a
friend
in
an
awkward
position
,
that
*NL*
I
did
not
mention
this
revision
before
;
though
you
heard
him
yourself
*NL*
threatening
to
kick
us
down
the
steps
.
To
clear
the
matter
up
,
I
declare
*NL*
now
that
I
did
have
recourse
to
his
assistance
,
and
that
I
paid
him
six
*NL*
roubles
for
it
.
But
I
did
not
ask
him
to
correct
my
style
;
I
simply
went
*NL*
to
him
for
information
concerning
the
facts
,
of
which
I
was
ignorant
*NL*
to
a
great
extent
,
and
which
he
was
competent
to
give
.
The
story
of
the
*NL*
gaiters
,
the
appetite
in
the
Swiss
professor
's
house
,
the
substitution
*NL*
of
fifty
roubles
for
two
hundred
and
fifty

all
such
details
,
in
fact
,
*NL*
were
got
from
him
.
I
paid
him
six
roubles
for
them
;
but
he
did
not
*NL*
correct
the
style
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
state
that
I
only
revised
the
first
part
of
the
article
,
''
*NL*
interposed
Lebedeff
with
feverish
impatience
,
while
laughter
rose
from
*NL*
all
around
him
;
``
but
we
fell
out
in
the
middle
over
one
idea
,
so
I
never
*NL*
corrected
the
second
part
.
Therefore
I
can
not
be
held
responsible
for
*NL*
the
numerous
grammatical
blunders
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
all
he
thinks
of
!

cried
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
ask
when
this
article
was
revised
?

said
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
to
*NL*
Keller
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yesterday
morning
,
''
he
replied
,
``
we
had
an
interview
which
we
all
gave
*NL*
our
word
of
honour
to
keep
secret
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
very
time
when
he
was
cringing
before
you
and
making
protestations
*NL*
of
devotion
!
Oh
,
the
mean
wretches
!
I
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
your
*NL*
Pushkin
,
and
your
daughter
shall
not
set
foot
in
my
house
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
was
about
to
rise
,
when
she
saw
Hippolyte
*NL*
laughing
,
and
turned
upon
him
with
irritation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
I
suppose
you
wanted
to
make
me
look
ridiculous
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heaven
forbid
!
''
he
answered
,
with
a
forced
smile
.
``
But
I
am
more
than
*NL*
ever
struck
by
your
eccentricity
,
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
.
I
admit
that
I
*NL*
told
you
of
Lebedeff
's
duplicity
,
on
purpose
.
I
knew
the
effect
it
would
*NL*
have
on
you
,
--
on
you
alone
,
for
the
prince
will
forgive
him
.
He
has
*NL*
probably
forgiven
him
already
,
and
is
racking
his
brains
to
find
some
*NL*
excuse
for
him
--
is
not
that
the
truth
,
prince
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
gasped
as
he
spoke
,
and
his
strange
agitation
seemed
to
increase
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
said
Mrs.
Epanchin
angrily
,
surprised
at
his
tone
;
``
well
,
what
*NL*
more
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
heard
many
things
of
the
kind
about
you
...
they
delighted
me
...
I
*NL*
have
learned
to
hold
you
in
the
highest
esteem

continued
Hippolyte
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
words
seemed
tinged
with
a
kind
of
sarcastic
mockery
,
yet
he
was
*NL*
extremely
agitated
,
casting
suspicious
glances
around
him
,
growing
*NL*
confused
,
and
constantly
losing
the
thread
of
his
ideas
.
All
this
,
*NL*
together
with
his
consumptive
appearance
,
and
the
frenzied
expression
of
*NL*
his
blazing
eyes
,
naturally
attracted
the
attention
of
everyone
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
might
have
been
surprised
-LRB-
though
I
admit
I
know
nothing
of
the
*NL*
world
-RRB-

not
only
that
you
should
have
stayed
on
just
now
in
the
company
*NL*
of
such
people
as
myself
and
my
friends
,
who
are
not
of
your
class
,
but
*NL*
that
you
should
let
these

young
ladies
listen
to
such
a
scandalous
*NL*
affair
,
though
no
doubt
novel-reading
has
taught
them
all
there
is
to
*NL*
know

I
may
be
mistaken

I
hardly
know
what
I
am
saying

surely
*NL*
no
one

you
would
have
stayed
to
please
a
whippersnapper

yes

*NL*
a
whippersnapper

I
admit
it
-RRB-
to
spend
the

take

everything

-LRB-
I
know
I
express
myself

badly

I
admire

appreciate
it
all
extremely

the
expression
*NL*
on
the
face
of
his
excellency

your
husband

shows
that
he
thinks
it
*NL*
very
improper

He-he

He
burst
out
laughing
,
and
was
seized
with
a
*NL*
fit
of
coughing
which
lasted
for
two
minutes
and
prevented
him
from
*NL*
speaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
lost
his
breath
now

said
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
coldly
,
looking
*NL*
at
him
with
more
curiosity
than
pity
:
``
Come

my
dear
boy

is
quite
*NL*
enough

let
us
make
an
end
of
this

*NL*
*NL*
Ivan
Fedorovitch
,
now
quite
out
of
patience

interrupted
suddenly
.
``
Let
*NL*
me
remark
in
my
turn

he
said
in
tones
of
deep
annoyance

that
in

young

it
is
not
for
you
to
pass
*NL*
judgment
on
the
conduct
of
Lizabetha

make
remarks

aloud
in

what
feelings
you

be
read
*NL*
in

Yes

continued
the
general
,
with
*NL*
increasing
irritation

``
more
out

amazement

anything

Everyone
can
understand
that
a
collection

such
strange
young
men

would
attract
the
attention
of
a
person
interested
in
contemporary
life

*NL*
I
stayed
myself
,
just
as
I
sometimes
stop
to
look
on
in
the
street
when
*NL*
I
see
something
that
may
be
regarded
as-as-as

*NL*
*NL*
``
As

Evgenie

involved
in

he
could
not
complete

*NL*
*NL*
``
That

exactly
the

said
the
general
with
*NL*
satisfaction

``
a

However

the
most
astonishing
and

if

may

thing

that

now
crimson

rage

``
Two

Prokofievna
to
her
husband

suddenly
to

She
arranged
her
daughter

hair
,
which
was
not
in
the

disordered

*NL*
and
gave
her
a
kiss

This
was
all
that
she
had
called
her
for

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought

Hippolyte

coming
out
*NL*
of
his
fit
of
abstraction

``
Yes

that
is
what
I
meant

he
added
,
*NL*
with
the
satisfaction
of
one
who
suddenly
remembers
something
he
had
*NL*
forgotten
.
``
Here
is
Burdovsky

sincerely
anxious
to
protect
his
mother

*NL*
is
not
that
so

And
he

is
the
cause
of
her
disgrace

The
prince

is
anxious
to
help
Burdovsky

offers
him
friendship

a
large
sum

of
money

sincerity

And
here
they
stand
like
two

enemies

You
all
hate
Burdovsky

his
behaviour

shocking

bet
now

he

continued
with
an
hysterical
laugh

that
Burdovsky

accuse
you

Yes

burning
with
fever
,
''
said
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
*NL*
impatiently
.
Her
anxious
eyes
had
never
left
the
invalid
.
``
Good
heavens
,
*NL*
he
is
going
to
begin
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
laughing
,
I
think
?
Why
do
you
keep
laughing
at
me
?
''
said
*NL*
Hippolyte
irritably
to
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
,
who
certainly
was
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only
want
to
know
,
Mr.
Hippolyte
--
excuse
me
,
I
forget
your
surname
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Terentieff
,
''
said
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
Mr.
Terentieff
.
Thank
you
prince
.
I
heard
it
just
now
,
but
had
*NL*
forgotten
it
.
I
want
to
know
,
Mr.
Terentieff
,
if
what
I
have
heard
about
*NL*
you
is
true
.
It
seems
you
are
convinced
that
if
you
could
speak
to
the
*NL*
people
from
a
window
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
you
could
make
them
all
*NL*
adopt
your
views
and
follow
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
may
have
said
so
,
''
answered
Hippolyte
,
as
if
trying
to
remember
.
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
certainly
said
so
,
''
he
continued
with
sudden
animation
,
fixing
*NL*
an
unflinching
glance
on
his
questioner
.
``
What
of
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
.
I
was
only
seeking
further
information
,
to
put
the
finishing
*NL*
touch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
was
silent
,
but
Hippolyte
kept
his
eyes
fixed
upon
*NL*
him
,
waiting
impatiently
for
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
have
you
finished
?
''
said
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
to
Evgenie
.
``
Make
*NL*
haste
,
sir
;
it
is
time
he
went
to
bed
.
Have
you
more
to
say
?
''
She
was
*NL*
very
angry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
have
a
little
more
,
''
said
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
,
with
a
smile
.
``
It
*NL*
seems
to
me
that
all
you
and
your
friends
have
said
,
Mr.
Terentieff
,
and
*NL*
all
you
have
just
put
forward
with
such
undeniable
talent
,
may
be
summed
*NL*
up
in
the
triumph
of
right
above
all
,
independent
of
everything
else
,
to
*NL*
the
exclusion
of
everything
else
;
perhaps
even
before
having
discovered
*NL*
what
constitutes
the
right
.
I
may
be
mistaken
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
certainly
mistaken
;
I
do
not
even
understand
you
.
What
else
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Murmurs
arose
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Burdovsky
and
his
companions
;
*NL*
Lebedeff
's
nephew
protested
under
his
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
nearly
finished
,
''
replied
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
only
remark
that
from
these
premises
one
could
conclude
that
*NL*
might
is
right
--
I
mean
the
right
of
the
clenched
fist
,
and
of
personal
*NL*
inclination
.
Indeed
,
the
world
has
often
come
to
that
conclusion
.
*NL*
Prudhon
upheld
that
might
is
right
.
In
the
American
War
some
of
the
most
*NL*
advanced
Liberals
took
sides
with
the
planters
on
the
score
that
the
*NL*
blacks
were
an
inferior
race
to
the
whites
,
and
that
might
was
the
right
*NL*
of
the
white
race
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
,
no
doubt
,
that
you
do
not
deny
that
might
is
right

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
at
least
logical
.
I
would
only
point
out
that
from
the
right
*NL*
of
might
,
to
the
right
of
tigers
and
crocodiles
,
or
even
Daniloff
and
*NL*
Gorsky
,
is
but
a
step
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
nothing
about
that
;
what
else
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hippolyte
was
scarcely
listening
.
He
kept
saying
``
well
?
''
and
``
what
else
?
''
*NL*
mechanically
,
without
the
least
curiosity
,
and
by
mere
force
of
habit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
nothing
else
;
that
is
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
However
,
I
bear
you
no
grudge
,
''
said
Hippolyte
suddenly
,
and
,
hardly
*NL*
conscious
of
what
he
was
doing
,
he
held
out
his
hand
with
a
smile
.
The
*NL*
gesture
took
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
by
surprise
,
but
with
the
utmost
gravity
*NL*
he
touched
the
hand
that
was
offered
him
in
token
of
forgiveness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
but
thank
you
,
''
he
said
,
in
a
tone
too
respectful
to
be
sincere
,
*NL*
``
for
your
kindness
in
letting
me
speak
,
for
I
have
often
noticed
that
*NL*
our
Liberals
never
allow
other
people
to
have
an
opinion
of
their
own
,
*NL*
and
immediately
answer
their
opponents
with
abuse
,
if
they
do
not
have
*NL*
recourse
to
arguments
of
a
still
more
unpleasant
nature
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
you
say
is
quite
true
,
''
observed
General
Epanchin
;
then
,
clasping
*NL*
his
hands
behind
his
back
,
he
returned
to
his
place
on
the
terrace
*NL*
steps
,
where
he
yawned
with
an
air
of
boredom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
sir
,
that
will
do
;
you
weary
me
,
''
said
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
*NL*
suddenly
to
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hippolyte
rose
all
at
once
,
looking
troubled
and
almost
frightened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
time
for
me
to
go
,
''
he
said
,
glancing
round
in
perplexity
.
``
I
*NL*
have
detained
you
...
I
wanted
to
tell
you
everything
...
I
thought
you
*NL*
all
...
for
the
last
time
...
it
was
a
whim
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
evidently
had
sudden
fits
of
returning
animation
,
when
he
awoke
*NL*
from
his
semi-delirium
;
then
,
recovering
full
self-possession
for
a
*NL*
few
moments
,
he
would
speak
,
in
disconnected
phrases
which
had
perhaps
*NL*
haunted
him
for
a
long
while
on
his
bed
of
suffering
,
during
weary
,
*NL*
sleepless
nights
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
good-bye
,
''
he
said
abruptly
.
``
You
think
it
is
easy
for
me
to
say
*NL*
good-bye
to
you
?
Ha
,
ha
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Feeling
that
his
question
was
somewhat
gauche
,
he
smiled
angrily
.
Then
*NL*
as
if
vexed
that
he
could
not
ever
express
what
he
really
meant
,
he
said
*NL*
irritably
,
in
a
loud
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excellency
,
I
have
the
honour
of
inviting
you
to
my
funeral
;
that
is
,
*NL*
if
you
will
deign
to
honour
it
with
your
presence
.
I
invite
you
all
,
*NL*
gentlemen
,
as
well
as
the
general
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
burst
out
laughing
again
,
but
it
was
the
laughter
of
a
madman
.
*NL*
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
approached
him
anxiously
and
seized
his
arm
.
*NL*
He
stared
at
her
for
a
moment
,
still
laughing
,
but
soon
his
face
grew
*NL*
serious
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
that
I
came
here
to
see
those
trees
?
''
pointing
to
the
*NL*
trees
in
the
park
.
``
It
is
not
ridiculous
,
is
it
?
Say
that
it
is
not
*NL*
ridiculous
!
''
he
demanded
urgently
of
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
.
Then
he
*NL*
seemed
to
be
plunged
in
thought
.
A
moment
later
he
raised
his
head
,
and
*NL*
his
eyes
sought
for
someone
.
He
was
looking
for
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
,
who
*NL*
was
close
by
on
his
right
as
before
,
but
he
had
forgotten
this
,
and
*NL*
his
eyes
ranged
over
the
assembled
company
.
``
Ah
!
you
have
not
gone
!
''
he
*NL*
said
,
when
he
caught
sight
of
him
at
last
.
``
You
kept
on
laughing
just
*NL*
now
,
because
I
thought
of
speaking
to
the
people
from
the
window
for
a
*NL*
quarter
of
an
hour
.
But
I
am
not
eighteen
,
you
know
;
lying
on
that
bed
,
*NL*
and
looking
out
of
that
window
,
I
have
thought
of
all
sorts
of
things
*NL*
for
such
a
long
time
that
...
a
dead
man
has
no
age
,
you
know
.
I
was
*NL*
saying
that
to
myself
only
last
week
,
when
I
was
awake
in
the
night
.
Do
*NL*
you
know
what
you
fear
most
?
You
fear
our
sincerity
more
than
anything
,
*NL*
although
you
despise
us
!
The
idea
crossed
my
mind
that
night
...
You
*NL*
thought
I
was
making
fun
of
you
just
now
,
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
?
No
,
the
*NL*
idea
of
mockery
was
far
from
me
;
I
only
meant
to
praise
you
.
Colia
*NL*
told
me
the
prince
called
you
a
child
--
very
well
--
but
let
me
see
,
I
had
*NL*
something
else
to
say
...
''
He
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
and
tried
*NL*
to
collect
his
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
yes
--
you
were
going
away
just
now
,
and
I
thought
to
myself
:
'
I
*NL*
shall
never
see
these
people
again-never
again
!
This
is
the
last
time
*NL*
I
shall
see
the
trees
,
too
.
I
shall
see
nothing
after
this
but
the
red
*NL*
brick
wall
of
Meyer
's
house
opposite
my
window
.
Tell
them
about
it
--
try
*NL*
to
tell
them
,
'
I
thought
.
`
Here
is
a
beautiful
young
girl
--
you
are
a
*NL*
dead
man
;
make
them
understand
that
.
Tell
them
that
a
dead
man
may
*NL*
say
anything
--
and
Mrs.
Grundy
will
not
be
angry
--
ha-ha
!
You
are
not
*NL*
laughing
?
''
He
looked
anxiously
around
.
``
But
you
know
I
get
so
many
queer
*NL*
ideas
,
lying
there
in
bed
.
I
have
grown
convinced
that
nature
is
full
of
*NL*
mockery
--
you
called
me
an
atheist
just
now
,
but
you
know
this
nature
...
*NL*
why
are
you
laughing
again
?
You
are
very
cruel
!
''
he
added
suddenly
,
*NL*
regarding
them
all
with
mournful
reproach
.
``
I
have
not
corrupted
Colia
,
''
*NL*
he
concluded
in
a
different
and
very
serious
tone
,
as
if
remembering
*NL*
something
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nobody
here
is
laughing
at
you
.
Calm
yourself
,
''
said
Lizabetha
*NL*
Prokofievna
,
much
moved
.
``
You
shall
see
a
new
doctor
tomorrow
;
the
*NL*
other
was
mistaken
;
but
sit
down
,
do
not
stand
like
that
!
You
are
*NL*
delirious
--
''
Oh
,
what
shall
we
do
with
him
she
cried
in
anguish
,
as
she
*NL*
made
him
sit
down
again
in
the
arm-chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
tear
glistened
on
her
cheek
.
At
the
sight
of
it
Hippolyte
seemed
*NL*
amazed
.
He
lifted
his
hand
timidly
and
,
touched
the
tear
with
his
*NL*
finger
,
smiling
like
a
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I.
.
.
you
,
''
he
began
joyfully
.
``
You
can
not
tell
how
I.
.
.
he
always
spoke
*NL*
so
enthusiastically
of
you
,
Colia
here
;
I
liked
his
enthusiasm
.
I
was
*NL*
not
corrupting
him
!
But
I
must
leave
him
,
too
--
I
wanted
to
leave
*NL*
them
all
--
there
was
not
one
of
them
--
not
one
!
I
wanted
to
be
a
man
of
*NL*
action
--
I
had
a
right
to
be
.
Oh
!
what
a
lot
of
things
I
wanted
!
Now
I
*NL*
want
nothing
;
I
renounce
all
my
wants
;
I
swore
to
myself
that
I
would
*NL*
want
nothing
;
let
them
seek
the
truth
without
me
!
Yes
,
nature
is
full
*NL*
of
mockery
!
Why
''
--
he
continued
with
sudden
warmth
--
``
does
she
create
*NL*
the
choicest
beings
only
to
mock
at
them
?
The
only
human
being
who
is
*NL*
recognized
as
perfect
,
when
nature
showed
him
to
mankind
,
was
given
the
*NL*
mission
to
say
things
which
have
caused
the
shedding
of
so
much
blood
*NL*
that
it
would
have
drowned
mankind
if
it
had
all
been
shed
at
once
!
Oh
!
*NL*
it
is
better
for
me
to
die
!
I
should
tell
some
dreadful
lie
too
;
nature
*NL*
would
so
contrive
it
!
I
have
corrupted
nobody
.
I
wanted
to
live
for
the
*NL*
happiness
of
all
men
,
to
find
and
spread
the
truth
.
I
used
to
look
out
*NL*
of
my
window
at
the
wall
of
Meyer
's
house
,
and
say
to
myself
that
if
I
*NL*
could
speak
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
I
would
convince
the
whole
world
,
*NL*
and
now
for
once
in
my
life
I
have
come
into
contact
with
...
you
--
if
*NL*
not
with
the
others
!
And
what
is
the
result
?
Nothing
!
The
sole
result
*NL*
is
that
you
despise
me
!
Therefore
I
must
be
a
fool
,
I
am
useless
,
it
is
*NL*
time
I
disappeared
!
And
I
shall
leave
not
even
a
memory
!
Not
a
sound
,
*NL*
not
a
trace
,
not
a
single
deed

I
have
not
spread
a
single
truth

...
Do
*NL*
not
laugh
at
the
fool
!
Forget
him
!
Forget
him
forever
!
I
beseech
you
,
*NL*
do
not
be
so
cruel
as
to
remember
!
Do
you
know
that
if
I
were
not
*NL*
consumptive
,
I
would
kill
myself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Though
he
seemed
to
wish
to
say
much
more
,
he
became
silent
.
He
fell
*NL*
back
into
his
chair
,
and
,
covering
his
face
with
his
hands
,
began
to
sob
*NL*
like
a
little
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
what
on
earth
are
we
to
do
with
him
?
''
cried
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
.
*NL*
She
hastened
to
him
and
pressed
his
head
against
her
bosom
,
while
he
*NL*
sobbed
convulsively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come

*NL*
*NL*
Hippolyte
raised
his
head
with
an
effort
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
little

Snatch

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak
,
Ivan
Fedorovitch
!
What
are
we
to
do
?
''
cried
Lizabetha
*NL*
Prokofievna
,
irritably
.
``
Please
break
your
majestic
silence
!
I
tell
you
,
*NL*
if
you
can
not
come
to
some
decision
,
I
will
stay
here
all
night
myself
.
*NL*
You
have
tyrannized
over
me
enough
,
you
autocrat
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
spoke
angrily
,
and
in
great
excitement
,
and
expected
an
immediate
*NL*
reply
.
But
in
such
a
case
,
no
matter
how
many
are
present
,
all
prefer
*NL*
to
keep
silence
:
no
one
will
take
the
initiative
,
but
all
reserve
their
*NL*
comments
till
afterwards
.
There
were
some
present
--
Varvara
Ardalionovna
,
*NL*
for
instance
--
who
would
have
willingly
sat
there
till
morning
without
*NL*
saying
a
word
.
Varvara
had
sat
apart
all
the
evening
without
opening
her
*NL*
lips
,
but
she
listened
to
everything
with
the
closest
attention
;
perhaps
*NL*
she
had
her
reasons
for
so
doing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
''
said
the
general
,
``
it
seems
to
me
that
a
sick-nurse
would
be
*NL*
of
more
use
here
than
an
excitable
person
like
you
.
Perhaps
it
would
be
*NL*
as
well
to
get
some
sober
,
reliable
man
for
the
night
.
In
any
case
we
*NL*
must
consult
the
prince
,
and
leave
the
patient
to
rest
at
once
.
Tomorrow
*NL*
we
can
see
what
can
be
done
for
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
nearly
midnight
;
we
are
going
.
Will
he
come
with
us
,
or
is
he
to
*NL*
stay
here
?
''
Doktorenko
asked
crossly
of
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
stay
with
him
if
you
like
,

said
Muishkin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
plenty
of
room
here

''
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
,
to
the
astonishment
of
all
,
Keller
went
quickly
up
to
the
*NL*
general
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excellency
,
''
he
said
,
impulsively
,
``
if
you
want
a
reliable
man
for
the
*NL*
night

I
am
ready
to
sacrifice
myself
for
my
friend

such
a
soul
as
he
*NL*
has
!
I
have
long
thought
him
a
great
man
,
excellency
!
My
article
showed
*NL*
my
lack
of
education
,
but
when
he
criticizes
he
scatters
pearls
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ivan
Fedorovitch
turned
from
the
boxer
with
a
gesture
of
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
be
delighted
if
he
will
stay
;
it
would
certainly
be
difficult
*NL*
for
him
to
get
back

Petersburg

said
the
prince
,
in
answer
to
the
*NL*
eager
questions
of
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
are
half
asleep

are
you
not

If
you
do
n't
want

I
will
*NL*
take
him
back
to
my
house
!
Why
,
good
gracious
!
He
can
hardly
stand
up
*NL*
himself
!
What
is
it
?
Are
you
ill
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Not
finding
the
prince
on
his
death-bed
,
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
had
been
*NL*
misled
by
his
appearance
to
think
him
much
better
than
he
was
.
But
his
*NL*
recent
illness
,
the
painful
memories
attached
to
it
,
the
fatigue
of
this
*NL*
evening
,
the
incident
with
``
Pavlicheff
's
son
,
''
and
now
this
scene
with
*NL*
Hippolyte
,
had
all
so
worked
on
his
oversensitive
nature
that
he
was
now
*NL*
almost
in
a
fever
.
Moreover
,
anew
trouble
,
almost
a
fear
,
showed
itself
*NL*
in
his
eyes
;
he
watched
Hippolyte
anxiously
as
if
expecting
something
*NL*
further
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
Hippolyte
arose
.
His
face
,
shockingly
pale
,
was
that
of
a
man
*NL*
overwhelmed
with
shame
and
despair
.
This
was
shown
chiefly
in
the
look
*NL*
of
fear
and
hatred
which
he
cast
upon
the
assembled
company
,
and
in
the
*NL*
wild
smile
upon
his
trembling
lips
.
Then
he
cast
down
his
eyes
,
and
with
*NL*
the
same
smile
,
staggered
towards
Burdovsky
and
Doktorenko
,
who
stood
at
*NL*
the
entrance
to
the
verandah
.
He
had
decided
to
go
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
!
that
is
what
I
feared
!
''
cried
the
prince
.
``
It
was
inevitable
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hippolyte
turned
upon
him
,
a
prey
to
maniacal
rage
,
which
set
all
the
*NL*
muscles
of
his
face
quivering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
that
is
what
you
feared
!
It
was
inevitable
,
you
say
!
Well
,
let
me
*NL*
tell
you
that
if
I
hate
anyone
here
--
I
hate
you
all
,
''
he
cried
,
in
a
*NL*
hoarse
,
strained
voice
--
``
but
you
,
you
,
with
your
jesuitical
soul
,
your
*NL*
soul
of
sickly
sweetness
,
idiot
,
beneficent
millionaire
--
I
hate
you
*NL*
worse
than
anything
or
anyone
on
earth
!
I
saw
through
you
and
hated
you
*NL*
long
ago
;
from
the
day
I
first
heard
of
you
.
I
hated
you
with
my
whole
*NL*
heart
.
You
have
contrived
all
this
!
You
have
driven
me
into
this
state

*NL*
You
have
made
a
dying
man
disgrace
himself

You

you

you
are
the
cause

my
abject
cowardice

I

kill
you

alive

not

I
will
accept
none
from
anyone

do
you
hear
?
Not
*NL*
from
any
one
!
I
want
nothing
!
I
was
delirious
,
do
not
dare
to
triumph
!
I
*NL*
curse
every
one
of
you
,
once
for
all
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Breath
failed
him
here
,
and
he
was
obliged
to
stop
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
ashamed
of
his
tears
!
''
whispered
Lebedeff
to
Lizabetha
*NL*
Prokofievna
.
``
It
was
inevitable
.
Ah
!
what
a
wonderful
man
the
prince
is
!
*NL*
He
read
his
very
soul
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Mrs.
Epanchin
would
not
deign
to
look
at
Lebedeff
.
Drawn
up
*NL*
haughtily
,
with
her
head
held
high
,
she
gazed
at
the
``
riff-raff
,
''
*NL*
with
scornful
curiosity
.
When
Hippolyte
had
finished
,
Ivan
Fedorovitch
*NL*
shrugged
his
shoulders
,
and
his
wife
looked
him
angrily
up
and
down
,
as
*NL*
if
to
demand
the
meaning
of
his
movement
.
Then
she
turned
to
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks
,
prince
,
many
thanks
,
eccentric
friend
of
the
family
,
for
the
*NL*
pleasant
evening
you
have
provided
for
us
.
I
am
sure
you
are
quite
*NL*
pleased
that
you
have
managed
to
mix
us
up
with
your
extraordinary
*NL*
affairs
.
It
is
quite
enough
,
dear
family
friend
;
thank
you
for
giving
us
*NL*
an
opportunity
of
getting
to
know
you
so
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
arranged
her
cloak
with
hands
that
trembled
with
anger
as
she
waited
*NL*
for
the
``
riff-raff
''
to
go
.
The
cab
which
Lebedeff
's
son
had
gone
to
*NL*
fetch
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
,
by
Doktorenko
's
order
,
arrived
at
that
*NL*
moment
.
The
general
thought
fit
to
put
in
a
word
after
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
,
prince
,
I
hardly
expected
after
--
after
all
our
friendly
*NL*
intercourse

and
you
see
,
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Papa
,
how
can
you
?
''
cried
Adelaida
,
walking
quickly
up
to
the
prince
*NL*
and
holding
out
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
smiled
absently
at
her
;
then
suddenly
he
felt
a
burning
sensation
in
*NL*
his
ear
as
an
angry
voice
whispered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
do
not
turn
those
dreadful
people
out
of
the
house
this
very
*NL*
instant
,
I
shall
hate
you
all
my
life
--
all
my
life
!
''
It
was
Aglaya
.
She
*NL*
seemed
almost
in
a
frenzy
,
but
she
turned
away
before
the
prince
could
*NL*
look
at
her
.
However
,
there
was
no
one
left
to
turn
out
of
the
house
,
*NL*
for
they
had
managed
meanwhile
to
get
Hippolyte
into
the
cab
,
and
it
had
*NL*
driven
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
how
much
longer
is
this
going
to
last
,
Ivan
Fedorovitch
?
What
do
*NL*
you
think
?
Shall
I
soon
be
delivered
from
these
odious
youths
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
I
am
quite
ready
;
naturally
...
the
prince
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ivan
Fedorovitch
held
out
his
hand
to
Muishkin
,
but
ran
after
his
wife
,
*NL*
who
was
leaving
with
every
sign
of
violent
indignation
,
before
he
had
*NL*
time
to
shake
it
.
Adelaida
,
her
fiance
,
and
Alexandra
,
said
good-bye
to
*NL*
their
host
with
sincere
friendliness
.
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
did
the
same
,
*NL*
and
he
alone
seemed
in
good
spirits
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
I
expected
has
happened
!
But
I
am
sorry
,
you
poor
fellow
,
that
*NL*
you
should
have
had
to
suffer
for
it
,
''
he
murmured
,
with
a
most
charming
*NL*
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aglaya
left
without
saying
good-bye
.
But
the
evening
was
not
to
end
*NL*
without
a
last
adventure
.
An
unexpected
meeting
was
yet
in
store
for
*NL*
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
scarcely
descended
the
terrace
steps
leading
to
the
high
road
*NL*
that
skirts
the
park
at
Pavlofsk
,
when
suddenly
there
dashed
by
a
smart
*NL*
open
carriage
,
drawn
by
a
pair
of
beautiful
white
horses
.
Having
passed
*NL*
some
ten
yards
beyond
the
house
,
the
carriage
suddenly
drew
up
,
and
one
*NL*
of
the
two
ladies
seated
in
it
turned
sharp
round
as
though
she
had
just
*NL*
caught
sight
of
some
acquaintance
whom
she
particularly
wished
to
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
!
Is
that
you
?
''
cried
a
clear
,
sweet
voice
,
which
*NL*
caused
the
prince
,
and
perhaps
someone
else
,
to
tremble
.
``
Well
,
I
_
am
_
*NL*
glad
I
've
found
you
at
last
!
I
've
sent
to
town
for
you
twice
today
*NL*
myself
!
My
messengers
have
been
searching
for
you
everywhere
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
stood
on
the
steps
like
one
struck
by
lightning
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Epanchin
stood
still
too
,
but
not
with
the
petrified
expression
of
*NL*
Evgenie
.
She
gazed
haughtily
at
the
audacious
person
who
had
addressed
*NL*
her
companion
,
and
then
turned
a
look
of
astonishment
upon
Evgenie
*NL*
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
news
!
''
continued
the
clear
voice
.
``
You
need
not
be
anxious
*NL*
about
Kupferof
's
IOU
's
--
Rogojin
has
bought
them
up
.
I
persuaded
him
*NL*
to
!
--
I
dare
say
we
shall
settle
Biscup
too
,
so
it
's
all
right
,
you
*NL*
see
!
_
Au
revoir
_
,
tomorrow
!
And
do
n't
worry
!
''
The
carriage
moved
on
,
and
*NL*
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
woman
's
mad
!
''
cried
Evgenie
,
at
last
,
crimson
with
anger
,
and
*NL*
looking
confusedly
around
.
``
I
do
n't
know
what
she
's
talking
about
!
What
*NL*
IOU
's
?
Who
is
she
?
''
Mrs.
Epanchin
continued
to
watch
his
face
for
a
*NL*
couple
of
seconds
;
then
she
marched
briskly
and
haughtily
away
towards
*NL*
her
own
house
,
the
rest
following
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
minute
afterwards
,
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
reappeared
on
the
terrace
,
in
*NL*
great
agitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Prince
,
''
he
said
,
``
tell
me
the
truth
;
do
you
know
what
all
this
means
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
nothing
whatever
about
it
!
''
replied
the
latter
,
who
was
,
*NL*
himself
,
in
a
state
of
nervous
excitement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
nor
do
I
!
''
said
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
,
laughing
suddenly
.
``
I
have
n't
*NL*
the
slightest
knowledge
of
any
such
IOU
's
as
she
mentioned
,
I
swear
I
*NL*
have
n't
--
What
's
the
matter
,
are
you
fainting
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
--
no
--
I
'm
all
right
,
I
assure
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
XI
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
anger
of
the
Epanchin
family
was
unappeased
for
three
days
.
As
usual
*NL*
the
prince
reproached
himself
,
and
had
expected
punishment
,
but
he
was
*NL*
inwardly
convinced
that
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
could
not
be
seriously
*NL*
angry
with
him
,
and
that
she
probably
was
more
angry
with
herself
.
He
*NL*
was
painfully
surprised
,
therefore
,
when
three
days
passed
with
no
word
*NL*
from
her
.
Other
things
also
troubled
and
perplexed
him
,
and
one
of
these
*NL*
grew
more
important
in
his
eyes
as
the
days
went
by
.
He
had
begun
to
*NL*
blame
himself
for
two
opposite
tendencies
--
on
the
one
hand
to
extreme
,
*NL*
almost
``
senseless
,
''
confidence
in
his
fellows
,
on
the
other
to
a
``
vile
,
*NL*
gloomy
suspiciousness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
end
of
the
third
day
the
incident
of
the
eccentric
lady
and
*NL*
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
had
attained
enormous
and
mysterious
proportions
in
*NL*
his
mind
.
He
sorrowfully
asked
himself
whether
he
had
been
the
cause
of
*NL*
this
new
``
monstrosity
,
''
or
was
it
...
but
he
refrained
from
saying
who
*NL*
else
might
be
in
fault
.
As
for
the
letters
N.P.B.
,
he
looked
on
that
as
*NL*
a
harmless
joke
,
a
mere
childish
piece
of
mischief
--
so
childish
that
*NL*
he
felt
it
would
be
shameful
,
almost
dishonourable
,
to
attach
any
*NL*
importance
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
after
these
scandalous
events
,
however
,
the
prince
had
the
*NL*
honour
of
receiving
a
visit
from
Adelaida
and
her
fiance
,
Prince
S
.
They
*NL*
came
,
ostensibly
,
to
inquire
after
his
health
.
They
had
wandered
out
for
*NL*
a
walk
,
and
called
in
``
by
accident
,
''
and
talked
for
almost
the
whole
*NL*
of
the
time
they
were
with
him
about
a
certain
most
lovely
tree
in
the
*NL*
park
,
which
Adelaida
had
set
her
heart
upon
for
a
picture
.
This
,
and
a
*NL*
little
amiable
conversation
on
Prince
S.
's
part
,
occupied
the
time
,
and
*NL*
not
a
word
was
said
about
last
evening
's
episodes
.
At
length
Adelaida
*NL*
burst
out
laughing
,
apologized
,
and
explained
that
they
had
come
*NL*
incognito
;
from
which
,
and
from
the
circumstance
that
they
said
nothing
*NL*
about
the
prince
's
either
walking
back
with
them
or
coming
to
see
them
*NL*
later
on
,
the
latter
inferred
that
he
was
in
Mrs.
Epanchin
's
black
*NL*
books
.
Adelaida
mentioned
a
watercolour
that
she
would
much
like
to
show
*NL*
him
,
and
explained
that
she
would
either
send
it
by
Colia
,
or
bring
it
*NL*
herself
the
next
day
--
which
to
the
prince
seemed
very
suggestive
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
,
however
,
just
as
the
visitors
were
on
the
point
of
departing
,
*NL*
Prince
S.
seemed
suddenly
to
recollect
himself
.
``
Oh
yes
,
by-the-by
,
''
he
*NL*
said
,
``
do
you
happen
to
know
,
my
dear
Lef
Nicolaievitch
,
who
that
lady
*NL*
was
who
called
out
to
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
last
night
,
from
the
carriage
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
Nastasia
Philipovna
,
''
said
the
prince
;
``
did
n't
you
know
that
?
I
*NL*
can
not
tell
you
who
her
companion
was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
on
earth
did
she
mean
?
I
assure
you
it
is
a
real
riddle
*NL*
to
me
--
to
me
,
and
to
others
,
too
!
''
Prince
S.
seemed
to
be
under
the
*NL*
influence
of
sincere
astonishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
spoke
of
some
bills
of
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
's
,
''
said
the
prince
,
*NL*
simply
,
``
which
Rogojin
had
bought
up
from
someone
;
and
implied
that
*NL*
Rogojin
would
not
press
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
heard
that
much
,
my
dear
fellow
!
But
the
thing
is
so
impossibly
*NL*
absurd
!
A
man
of
property
like
Evgenie
to
give
IOU
's
to
a
money-lender
,
*NL*
and
to
be
worried
about
them
!
It
is
ridiculous
.
Besides
,
he
can
not
*NL*
possibly
be
on
such
intimate
terms
with
Nastasia
Philipovna
as
she
gave
*NL*
us
to
understand
;
that
's
the
principal
part
of
the
mystery
!
He
has
given
*NL*
me
his
word
that
he
knows
nothing
whatever
about
the
matter
,
and
of
*NL*
course
I
believe
him
.
Well
,
the
question
is
,
my
dear
prince
,
do
you
know
*NL*
anything
about
it
?
Has
any
sort
of
suspicion
of
the
meaning
of
it
come
*NL*
across
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
know
nothing
whatever
about
it
.
I
assure
you
I
had
nothing
at
all
*NL*
to
do
with
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
prince
,
how
strange
you
have
become
!
I
assure
you
,
I
hardly
know
*NL*
you
for
your
old
self
.
How
can
you
suppose
that
I
ever
suggested
you
*NL*
could
have
had
a
finger
in
such
a
business
?
But
you
are
not
quite
*NL*
yourself
today
,
I
can
see
.
''
He
embraced
the
prince
,
and
kissed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
,
though
,
''
asked
Muishkin
,
''
`
by
such
a
business
'
?
I
*NL*
do
n't
see
any
particular
`
business
'
about
it
at
all
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
undoubtedly
,
this
person
wished
somehow
,
and
for
some
reason
,
to
*NL*
do
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
a
bad
turn
,
by
attributing
to
him
--
before
*NL*
witnesses
--
qualities
which
he
neither
has
nor
can
have
,
''
replied
Prince
*NL*
S.
drily
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
Muiskhin
looked
disturbed
,
but
continued
to
gaze
intently
and
*NL*
questioningly
into
Prince
S.
's
face
.
The
latter
,
however
,
remained
*NL*
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
it
was
not
simply
a
matter
of
bills
?
''
Muishkin
said
at
last
,
with
*NL*
some
impatience
.
``
It
was
not
as
she
said
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
ask
you
,
my
dear
sir
,
how
can
there
be
anything
in
common
between
*NL*
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
,
and
--
her
,
and
again
Rogojin
?
I
tell
you
he
is
a
man
*NL*
of
immense
wealth
--
as
I
know
for
a
fact
;
and
he
has
further
expectations
*NL*
from
his
uncle
.
Simply
Nastasia
Philipovna
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
S.
paused
,
as
though
unwilling
to
continue
talking
about
Nastasia
*NL*
Philipovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
at
all
events
he
knows
her
!
''
remarked
the
prince
,
after
a
moment
's
*NL*
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
may
be
.
He
may
have
known
her
some
time
ago
--
two
or
three
*NL*
years
,
at
least
.
He
used
to
know
Totski
.
But
it
is
impossible
that
*NL*
there
should
be
any
intimacy
between
them
.
She
has
not
even
been
in
the
*NL*
place
--
many
people
do
n't
even
know
that
she
has
returned
from
Moscow
!
I
*NL*
have
only
observed
her
carriage
about
for
the
last
three
days
or
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
lovely
carriage
,
''
said
Adelaida
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
was
a
beautiful
turn-out
,
certainly
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
visitors
left
the
house
,
however
,
on
no
less
friendly
terms
than
*NL*
before
.
But
the
visit
was
of
the
greatest
importance
to
the
prince
,
from
*NL*
his
own
point
of
view
.
Admitting
that
he
had
his
suspicions
,
from
*NL*
the
moment
of
the
occurrence
of
last
night
,
perhaps
even
before
,
that
*NL*
Nastasia
had
some
mysterious
end
in
view
,
yet
this
visit
confirmed
his
*NL*
suspicions
and
justified
his
fears
.
It
was
all
clear
to
him
;
Prince
S.
*NL*
was
wrong
,
perhaps
,
in
his
view
of
the
matter
,
but
he
was
somewhere
near
*NL*
the
truth
,
and
was
right
in
so
far
as
that
he
understood
there
to
be
*NL*
an
intrigue
of
some
sort
going
on
.
Perhaps
Prince
S.
saw
it
all
more
*NL*
clearly
than
he
had
allowed
his
hearers
to
understand
.
At
all
events
,
*NL*
nothing
could
be
plainer
than
that
he
and
Adelaida
had
come
for
the
*NL*
express
purpose
of
obtaining
explanations
,
and
that
they
suspected
him
*NL*
of
being
concerned
in
the
affair
.
And
if
all
this
were
so
,
then
_
she
_
must
*NL*
have
some
terrible
object
in
view
!
What
was
it
?
There
was
no
stopping
*NL*
_
her
_
,
as
Muishkin
knew
from
experience
,
in
the
performance
of
anything
*NL*
she
had
set
her
mind
on
!
``
Oh
,
she
is
mad
,
mad
!
''
thought
the
poor
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
were
many
other
puzzling
occurrences
that
day
,
which
required
*NL*
immediate
explanation
,
and
the
prince
felt
very
sad
.
A
visit
from
Vera
*NL*
Lebedeff
distracted
him
a
little
.
She
brought
the
infant
Lubotchka
with
*NL*
her
as
usual
,
and
talked
cheerfully
for
some
time
.
Then
came
her
younger
*NL*
sister
,
and
later
the
brother
,
who
attended
a
school
close
by
.
He
*NL*
informed
Muishkin
that
his
father
had
lately
found
a
new
interpretation
*NL*
of
the
star
called
``
wormwood
,
''
which
fell
upon
the
water-springs
,
as
*NL*
described
in
the
Apocalypse
.
He
had
decided
that
it
meant
the
network
of
*NL*
railroads
spread
over
the
face
of
Europe
at
the
present
time
.
The
*NL*
prince
refused
to
believe
that
Lebedeff
could
have
given
such
an
*NL*
interpretation
,
and
they
decided
to
ask
him
about
it
at
the
earliest
*NL*
opportunity
.
Vera
related
how
Keller
had
taken
up
his
abode
with
them
on
*NL*
the
previous
evening
.
She
thought
he
would
remain
for
some
time
,
as
he
*NL*
was
greatly
pleased
with
the
society
of
General
Ivolgin
and
of
the
*NL*
whole
family
.
But
he
declared
that
he
had
only
come
to
them
in
order
*NL*
to
complete
his
education
!
The
prince
always
enjoyed
the
company
of
*NL*
Lebedeff
's
children
,
and
today
it
was
especially
welcome
,
for
Colia
did
*NL*
not
appear
all
day
.
Early
that
morning
he
had
started
for
Petersburg
.
*NL*
Lebedeff
also
was
away
on
business
.
But
Gavrila
Ardalionovitch
had
*NL*
promised
to
visit
Muishkin
,
who
eagerly
awaited
his
coming
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
seven
in
the
evening
,
soon
after
dinner
,
he
arrived
.
At
the
first
*NL*
glance
it
struck
the
prince
that
he
,
at
any
rate
,
must
know
all
the
*NL*
details
of
last
night
's
affair
.
Indeed
,
it
would
have
been
impossible
*NL*
for
him
to
remain
in
ignorance
considering
the
intimate
relationship
*NL*
between
him
,
Varvara
Ardalionovna
,
and
Ptitsin
.
But
although
he
and
the
*NL*
prince
were
intimate
,
in
a
sense
,
and
although
the
latter
had
placed
*NL*
the
Burdovsky
affair
in
his
hands
--
and
this
was
not
the
only
mark
of
*NL*
confidence
he
had
received
--
it
seemed
curious
how
many
matters
there
*NL*
were
that
were
tacitly
avoided
in
their
conversations
.
Muishkin
thought
*NL*
that
Gania
at
times
appeared
to
desire
more
cordiality
and
frankness
.
*NL*
It
was
apparent
now
,
when
he
entered
,
that
he
was
convinced
that
the
*NL*
moment
for
breaking
the
ice
between
them
had
come
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
all
the
same
Gania
was
in
haste
,
for
his
sister
was
waiting
at
*NL*
Lebedeff
's
to
consult
him
on
an
urgent
matter
of
business
.
If
he
had
*NL*
anticipated
impatient
questions
,
or
impulsive
confidences
,
he
was
*NL*
soon
undeceived
.
The
prince
was
thoughtful
,
reserved
,
even
a
little
*NL*
absent-minded
,
and
asked
none
of
the
questions
--
one
in
particular
--
that
*NL*
Gania
had
expected
.
So
he
imitated
the
prince
's
demeanour
,
and
talked
*NL*
fast
and
brilliantly
upon
all
subjects
but
the
one
on
which
their
*NL*
thoughts
were
engaged
.
Among
other
things
Gania
told
his
host
that
*NL*
Nastasia
Philipovna
had
been
only
four
days
in
Pavlofsk
,
and
that
*NL*
everyone
was
talking
about
her
already
.
She
was
staying
with
Daria
*NL*
Alexeyevna
,
in
an
ugly
little
house
in
Mattrossky
Street
,
but
drove
*NL*
about
in
the
smartest
carriage
in
the
place
.
A
crowd
of
followers
*NL*
had
pursued
her
from
the
first
,
young
and
old
.
Some
escorted
her
on
*NL*
horse-back
when
she
took
the
air
in
her
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
as
capricious
as
ever
in
the
choice
of
her
acquaintances
,
and
*NL*
admitted
few
into
her
narrow
circle
.
Yet
she
already
had
a
numerous
*NL*
following
and
many
champions
on
whom
she
could
depend
in
time
of
need
.
*NL*
One
gentleman
on
his
holiday
had
broken
off
his
engagement
on
her
*NL*
account
,
and
an
old
general
had
quarrelled
with
his
only
son
for
the
*NL*
same
reason
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
accompanied
sometimes
in
her
carriage
by
a
girl
of
sixteen
,
*NL*
a
distant
relative
of
her
hostess
.
This
young
lady
sang
very
well
;
in
*NL*
fact
,
her
music
had
given
a
kind
of
notoriety
to
their
little
house
.
*NL*
Nastasia
,
however
,
was
behaving
with
great
discretion
on
the
whole
.
She
*NL*
dressed
quietly
,
though
with
such
taste
as
to
drive
all
the
ladies
*NL*
in
Pavlofsk
mad
with
envy
,
of
that
,
as
well
as
of
her
beauty
and
her
*NL*
carriage
and
horses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
for
yesterday
's
episode
,
''
continued
Gania
,
``
of
course
it
was
*NL*
pre-arranged
.
''
Here
he
paused
,
as
though
expecting
to
be
asked
how
*NL*
he
knew
that
.
But
the
prince
did
not
inquire
.
Concerning
Evgenie
*NL*
Pavlovitch
,
Gania
stated
,
without
being
asked
,
that
he
believed
the
*NL*
former
had
not
known
Nastasia
Philipovna
in
past
years
,
but
that
he
had
*NL*
probably
been
introduced
to
her
by
somebody
in
the
park
during
these
*NL*
four
days
.
As
to
the
question
of
the
IOU
's
she
had
spoken
of
,
there
*NL*
might
easily
be
something
in
that
;
for
though
Evgenie
was
undoubtedly
*NL*
a
man
of
wealth
,
yet
certain
of
his
affairs
were
equally
undoubtedly
in
*NL*
disorder
.
Arrived
at
this
interesting
point
,
Gania
suddenly
broke
off
,
*NL*
and
said
no
more
about
Nastasia
's
prank
of
the
previous
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
Varvara
Ardalionovna
came
in
search
of
her
brother
,
and
remained
*NL*
for
a
few
minutes
.
Without
Muishkin
's
asking
her
,
she
informed
him
that
*NL*
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
was
spending
the
day
in
Petersburg
,
and
perhaps
would
*NL*
remain
there
over
tomorrow
;
and
that
her
husband
had
also
gone
to
town
,
*NL*
probably
in
connection
with
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
's
affairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
is
in
a
really
fiendish
temper
today
,
''
she
*NL*
added
,
as
she
went
out
,
``
but
the
most
curious
thing
is
that
Aglaya
has
*NL*
quarrelled
with
her
whole
family
;
not
only
with
her
father
and
mother
,
*NL*
but
with
her
sisters
also
.
It
is
not
a
good
sign
.
''
She
said
all
this
*NL*
quite
casually
,
though
it
was
extremely
important
in
the
eyes
of
*NL*
the
prince
,
and
went
off
with
her
brother
.
Regarding
the
episode
of
*NL*
``
Pavlicheff
's
son
,
''
Gania
had
been
absolutely
silent
,
partly
from
a
kind
*NL*
of
false
modesty
,
partly
,
perhaps
,
to
``
spare
the
prince
's
feelings
.
''
The
*NL*
latter
,
however
,
thanked
him
again
for
the
trouble
he
had
taken
in
the
*NL*
affair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Muishkin
was
glad
enough
to
be
left
alone
.
He
went
out
of
the
garden
,
*NL*
crossed
the
road
,
and
entered
the
park
.
He
wished
to
reflect
,
and
to
*NL*
make
up
his
mind
as
to
a
certain
``
step
.
''
This
step
was
one
of
those
*NL*
things
,
however
,
which
are
not
thought
out
,
as
a
rule
,
but
decided
for
*NL*
or
against
hastily
,
and
without
much
reflection
.
The
fact
is
,
he
felt
a
*NL*
longing
to
leave
all
this
and
go
away
--
go
anywhere
,
if
only
it
were
*NL*
far
enough
,
and
at
once
,
without
bidding
farewell
to
anyone
.
He
felt
a
*NL*
presentiment
that
if
he
remained
but
a
few
days
more
in
this
place
,
and
*NL*
among
these
people
,
he
would
be
fixed
there
irrevocably
and
permanently
.
*NL*
However
,
in
a
very
few
minutes
he
decided
that
to
run
away
was
*NL*
impossible
;
that
it
would
be
cowardly
;
that
great
problems
lay
before
*NL*
him
,
and
that
he
had
no
right
to
leave
them
unsolved
,
or
at
least
to
*NL*
refuse
to
give
all
his
energy
and
strength
to
the
attempt
to
solve
them
.
*NL*
Having
come
to
this
determination
,
he
turned
and
went
home
,
his
walk
*NL*
having
lasted
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
At
that
moment
he
was
*NL*
thoroughly
unhappy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lebedeff
had
not
returned
,
so
towards
evening
Keller
managed
to
*NL*
penetrate
into
the
prince
's
apartments
.
He
was
not
drunk
,
but
in
a
*NL*
confidential
and
talkative
mood
.
He
announced
that
he
had
come
to
tell
*NL*
the
story
of
his
life
to
Muishkin
,
and
had
only
remained
at
Pavlofsk
for
*NL*
that
purpose
.
There
was
no
means
of
turning
him
out
;
nothing
short
of
an
*NL*
earthquake
would
have
removed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
manner
of
one
with
long
hours
before
him
,
he
began
his
history
;
*NL*
but
after
a
few
incoherent
words
he
jumped
to
the
conclusion
,
which
*NL*
was
that
``
having
ceased
to
believe
in
God
Almighty
,
he
had
lost
every
*NL*
vestige
of
morality
,
and
had
gone
so
far
as
to
commit
a
theft
.
''
``
Could
*NL*
you
imagine
such
a
thing
?
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
to
me
,
Keller
,
''
returned
the
prince
.
``
If
I
were
in
your
place
,
I
*NL*
should
not
acknowledge
that
unless
it
were
absolutely
necessary
for
some
*NL*
reason
.
But
perhaps
you
are
making
yourself
out
to
be
worse
than
you
*NL*
are
,
purposely
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
tell
it
to
no
one
but
yourself
,
prince
,
and
I
only
name
it
now
*NL*
as
a
help
to
my
soul
's
evolution
.
When
I
die
,
that
secret
will
die
with
*NL*
me
!
But
,
excellency
,
if
you
knew
,
if
you
only
had
the
least
idea
,
how
*NL*
difficult
it
is
to
get
money
nowadays
!
Where
to
find
it
is
the
question
.
*NL*
Ask
for
a
loan
,
the
answer
is
always
the
same
:
`
Give
us
gold
,
jewels
,
or
*NL*
diamonds
,
and
it
will
be
quite
easy
.
'
Exactly
what
one
has
not
got
!
Can
*NL*
you
picture
that
to
yourself
?
I
got
angry
at
last
,
and
said
,
'
I
*NL*
suppose
you
would
accept
emeralds
?
'
`
Certainly
,
we
accept
emeralds
with
*NL*
pleasure
.
Yes
!
'
`
Well
,
that
's
all
right
,
'
said
I.
`
Go
to
the
devil
,
you
*NL*
den
of
thieves
!
'
And
with
that
I
seized
my
hat
,
and
walked
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Had
you
any
emeralds
?
''
asked
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
I
have
emeralds
?
Oh
,
prince
!
with
what
simplicity
,
with
what
*NL*
almost
pastoral
simplicity
,
you
look
upon
life
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Could
not
something
be
made
of
this
man
under
good
influences
?
asked
the
*NL*
prince
of
himself
,
for
he
began
to
feel
a
kind
of
pity
for
his
visitor
.
*NL*
He
thought
little
of
the
value
of
his
own
personal
influence
,
not
from
*NL*
a
sense
of
humility
,
but
from
his
peculiar
way
of
looking
at
things
*NL*
in
general
.
Imperceptibly
the
conversation
grew
more
animated
and
more
*NL*
interesting
,
so
that
neither
of
the
two
felt
anxious
to
bring
it
to
a
*NL*
close
.
Keller
confessed
,
with
apparent
sincerity
,
to
having
been
guilty
*NL*
of
many
acts
of
such
a
nature
that
it
astonished
the
prince
that
he
*NL*
could
mention
them
,
even
to
him
.
At
every
fresh
avowal
he
professed
the
*NL*
deepest
repentance
,
and
described
himself
as
being
``
bathed
in
tears
''
;
*NL*
but
this
did
not
prevent
him
from
putting
on
a
boastful
air
at
times
,
*NL*
and
some
of
his
stories
were
so
absurdly
comical
that
both
he
and
the
*NL*
prince
laughed
like
madmen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
point
in
your
favour
is
that
you
seem
to
have
a
child-like
mind
,
*NL*
and
extreme
truthfulness
,
''
said
the
prince
at
last
.
``
Do
you
know
that
*NL*
that
atones
for
much
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
assuredly
noble-minded
,
and
chivalrous
to
a
degree
!
''
said
Keller
,
*NL*
much
softened
.
``
But
,
do
you
know
,
this
nobility
of
mind
exists
in
a
*NL*
dream
,
if
one
may
put
it
so
?
It
never
appears
in
practice
or
deed
.
Now
,
*NL*
why
is
that
?
I
can
never
understand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
despair
.
I
think
we
may
say
without
fear
of
deceiving
ourselves
,
*NL*
that
you
have
now
given
a
fairly
exact
account
of
your
life
.
I
,
at
*NL*
least
,
think
it
would
be
impossible
to
add
much
to
what
you
have
just
*NL*
told
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Impossible
?
''
cried
Keller
,
almost
pityingly
.
``
Oh
prince
,
how
little
you
*NL*
really
seem
to
understand
human
nature
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
really
much
more
to
be
added
?
''
asked
the
prince
,
with
mild
*NL*
surprise
.
``
Well
,
what
is
it
you
really
want
of
me
?
Speak
out
;
tell
me
*NL*
why
you
came
to
make
your
confession
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
I
want
?
Well
,
to
begin
with
,
it
is
good
to
meet
a
man
like
*NL*
you
.
It
is
a
pleasure
to
talk
over
my
faults
with
you
.
I
know
you
for
*NL*
one
of
the
best
of
men
...
and
then
...
then
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
hesitated
,
and
appeared
so
much
embarrassed
that
the
prince
helped
*NL*
him
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
wanted
me
to
lend
you
money
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
words
were
spoken
in
a
grave
tone
,
and
even
somewhat
shyly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Keller
started
,
gave
an
astonished
look
at
the
speaker
,
and
thumped
the
*NL*
table
with
his
fist
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
prince
,
that
's
enough
to
knock
me
down
!
It
astounds
me
!
Here
you
*NL*
are
,
as
simple
and
innocent
as
a
knight
of
the
golden
age
,
and
yet
...
*NL*
yet
...
you
read
a
man
's
soul
like
a
psychologist
!
Now
,
do
explain
it
to
*NL*
me
,
prince
,
because
I.
.
.
I
really
do
not
understand
!
...
Of
course
,
my
*NL*
aim
was
to
borrow
money
all
along
,
and
you
...
you
asked
the
question
*NL*
as
if
there
was
nothing
blameable
in
it
--
as
if
you
thought
it
quite
*NL*
natural
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
...
from
you
it
is
quite
natural
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
are
not
offended
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
I
be
offended
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
just
listen
,
prince
.
I
remained
here
last
evening
,
partly
because
*NL*
I
have
a
great
admiration
for
the
French
archbishop
Bourdaloue
.
I
*NL*
enjoyed
a
discussion
over
him
till
three
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
with
*NL*
Lebedeff
;
and
then
...
then
--
I
swear
by
all
I
hold
sacred
that
I
am
*NL*
telling
you
the
truth
--
then
I
wished
to
develop
my
soul
in
this
frank
*NL*
and
heartfelt
confession
to
you
.
This
was
my
thought
as
I
was
sobbing
*NL*
myself
to
sleep
at
dawn
.
Just
as
I
was
losing
consciousness
,
tears
in
*NL*
my
soul
,
tears
on
my
face
-LRB-
I
remember
how
I
lay
there
sobbing
-RRB-
,
an
idea
*NL*
from
hell
struck
me
.
`
Why
not
,
after
confessing
,
borrow
money
from
him
?
'
*NL*
You
see
,
this
confession
was
a
kind
of
masterstroke
;
I
intended
to
use
*NL*
it
as
a
means
to
your
good
grace
and
favour
--
and
then
--
then
I
meant
to
*NL*
walk
off
with
a
hundred
and
fifty
roubles
.
Now
,
do
you
not
call
that
*NL*
base
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
hardly
an
exact
statement
of
the
case
,
''
said
the
prince
in
reply
.
*NL*
``
You
have
confused
your
motives
and
ideas
,
as
I
need
scarcely
say
too
*NL*
often
happens
to
myself
.
I
can
assure
you
,
Keller
,
I
reproach
myself
*NL*
bitterly
for
it
sometimes
.
When
you
were
talking
just
now
I
seemed
to
be
*NL*
listening
to
something
about
myself
.
At
times
I
have
imagined
that
all
*NL*
men
were
the
same
,
''
he
continued
earnestly
,
for
he
appeared
to
be
much
*NL*
interested
in
the
conversation
,
``
and
that
consoled
me
in
a
certain
*NL*
degree
,
for
a
_
double
_
motive
is
a
thing
most
difficult
to
fight
against
.
*NL*
I
have
tried
,
and
I
know
.
God
knows
whence
they
arise
,
these
ideas
that
*NL*
you
speak
of
as
base
.
I
fear
these
double
motives
more
than
ever
just
*NL*
now
,
but
I
am
not
your
judge
,
and
in
my
opinion
it
is
going
too
far
to
*NL*
give
the
name
of
baseness
to
it
--
what
do
you
think
?
You
were
going
*NL*
to
employ
your
tears
as
a
ruse
in
order
to
borrow
money
,
but
you
also
*NL*
say
--
in
fact
,
you
have
sworn
to
the
fact
--
that
independently
of
this
*NL*
your
confession
was
made
with
an
honourable
motive
.
As
for
the
money
,
*NL*
you
want
it
for
drink
,
do
you
not
?
After
your
confession
,
that
is
*NL*
weakness
,
of
course
;
but
,
after
all
,
how
can
anyone
give
up
a
bad
habit
*NL*
at
a
moment
's
notice
?
It
is
impossible
.
What
can
we
do
?
It
is
best
,
I
*NL*
think
,
to
leave
the
matter
to
your
own
conscience
.
How
does
it
seem
to
*NL*
you
?
''
As
he
concluded
the
prince
looked
curiously
at
Keller
;
evidently
*NL*
this
problem
of
double
motives
had
often
been
considered
by
him
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
how
anybody
can
call
you
an
idiot
after
that
,
is
more
than
I
can
*NL*
understand
!
''
cried
the
boxer
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
reddened
slightly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bourdaloue
,
the
archbishop
,
would
not
have
spared
a
man
like
me
,
''
*NL*
Keller
continued
,
``
but
you
,
you
have
judged
me
with
humanity
.
To
show
*NL*
how
grateful
I
am
,
and
as
a
punishment
,
I
will
not
accept
a
hundred
and
*NL*
fifty
roubles
.
Give
me
twenty-five
--
that
will
be
enough
;
it
is
all
I
*NL*
really
need
,
for
a
fortnight
at
least
.
I
will
not
ask
you
for
more
for
*NL*
a
fortnight
.
I
should
like
to
have
given
Agatha
a
present
,
but
she
does
*NL*
not
really
deserve
it
.
Oh
,
my
dear
prince
,
God
bless
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
Lebedeff
appeared
,
having
just
arrived
from
Petersburg
.
*NL*
He
frowned
when
he
saw
the
twenty-five
rouble
note
in
Keller
's
hand
,
but
*NL*
the
latter
,
having
got
the
money
,
went
away
at
once
.
Lebedeff
began
to
*NL*
abuse
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
unjust
;
I
found
him
sincerely
repentant
,
''
observed
the
prince
,
*NL*
after
listening
for
a
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
good
of
repentance
like
that
?
It
is
the
same
exactly
as
*NL*
mine
yesterday
,
when
I
said
,
'
I
am
base
,
I
am
base
,
'
--
words
,
and
nothing
*NL*
more
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
they
were
only
words
on
your
part

I
thought
,
on
the
contrary
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
do
n't
mind
telling
you
the
truth

you
only

Because
you
see
*NL*
through

man
somehow

Words
and
actions
,
truth
and
falsehood
,
are
all
*NL*
jumbled
up
together
in
me
,
and
yet
I
am
perfectly
sincere

I
feel
the
*NL*
deepest
repentance
,
believe
it
or
not
,
as
you
choose
;
but
words
and
lies
*NL*
come
out
in
the
infernal
craving
to
get
the
better
of
other
people
.
*NL*
It
is
always
there
--
the
notion
of
cheating
people
,
and
of
using
my
*NL*
repentant
tears
to
my
own
advantage
!
I
assure
you
this
is
the
truth
,
*NL*
prince
!
I
would
not
tell
any
other
man
for
the
world

He
would
laugh
and
*NL*
jeer
at
me

you

you
judge
a
man
humanely

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

Keller
said
the
same
thing
to
me
nearly
word
for
word
a
few
*NL*
minutes
ago

cried
Muishkin
.
``
And
you
both
seem
inclined

boast
about

it

astonish
me

more
sincere

grinned
and
wriggled
.

carriage
yesterday

*NL*
*NL*
Lebedeff
began
to
grin
again
,
rubbed
his
hands
,
sneezed
,
but
spoke
not
a

word
in
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*

``
Indirectly

quite
indirectly

am
speaking
the
truth

am
indeed

impatiently

Lebedeff
,
waving
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
engineered
by
other
people
,
and
is
,
properly
speaking
,
rather
a
*NL*
fantasy
than
an
intrigue
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
is
it
all
about
?
Tell
me
,
for
Heaven
's
sake
!
Can
not
you
*NL*
understand
how
nearly
it
touches
me
?
Why
are
they
blackening
Evgenie
*NL*
Pavlovitch
's
reputation
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lebedeff
grimaced
and
wriggled
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Prince
!
''
said
he
.
``
Excellency
!
You
wo
n't
let
me
tell
you
the
whole
*NL*
truth
;
I
have
tried
to
explain
;
more
than
once
I
have
begun
,
but
you
*NL*
have
not
allowed
me
to
go
on
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
gave
no
answer
,
and
sat
deep
in
thought
.
Evidently
he
was
*NL*
struggling
to
decide
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
!
Tell
me
the
truth
,
''
he
said
,
dejectedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aglaya
Ivanovna
...
''
began
Lebedeff
,
promptly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
silent
!
At
once
!
''
interrupted
the
prince
,
red
with
indignation
,
and
*NL*
perhaps
with
shame
,
too
.
``
It
is
impossible
and
absurd
!
All
that
has
been
*NL*
invented
by
you
,
or
fools
like
you
!
Let
me
never
hear
you
say
a
word
*NL*
again
on
that
subject
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Late
in
the
evening
Colia
came
in
with
a
whole
budget
of
Petersburg
and
*NL*
Pavlofsk
news
.
He
did
not
dwell
much
on
the
Petersburg
part
of
it
,
which
*NL*
consisted
chiefly
of
intelligence
about
his
friend
Hippolyte
,
but
passed
*NL*
quickly
to
the
Pavlofsk
tidings
.
He
had
gone
straight
to
the
Epanchins
'
*NL*
from
the
station
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
the
deuce
and
all
going
on
there
!
''
he
said
.
``
First
of
all
about
*NL*
the
row
last
night
,
and
I
think
there
must
be
something
new
as
well
,
*NL*
though
I
did
n't
like
to
ask
.
Not
a
word
about
_
you
_
,
prince
,
the
whole
*NL*
time
!
The
most
interesting
fact
was
that
Aglaya
had
been
quarrelling
*NL*
with
her
people
about
Gania
.
Colia
did
not
know
any
details
,
except
that
*NL*
it
had
been
a
terrible
quarrel
!
Also
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
had
called
,
and
*NL*
met
with
an
excellent
reception
all
round
.
And
another
curious
thing
:
*NL*
Mrs.
Epanchin
was
so
angry
that
she
called
Varia
to
her
--
Varia
was
*NL*
talking
to
the
girls
--
and
turned
her
out
of
the
house
`
once
for
all
'
she
*NL*
said
.
I
heard
it
from
Varia
herself
--
Mrs.
Epanchin
was
quite
polite
,
*NL*
but
firm
;
and
when
Varia
said
good-bye
to
the
girls
,
she
told
them
*NL*
nothing
about
it
,
and
they
did
n't
know
they
were
saying
goodbye
for
the
*NL*
last
time
.
I
'm
sorry
for
Varia
,
and
for
Gania
too
;
he
is
n't
half
a
bad
*NL*
fellow
,
in
spite
of
his
faults
,
and
I
shall
never
forgive
myself
for
not
*NL*
liking
him
before
!
I
do
n't
know
whether
I
ought
to
continue
to
go
to
the
*NL*
Epanchins
'
now
,
''
concluded
Colia
--
``
I
like
to
be
quite
independent
of
*NL*
others
,
and
of
other
people
's
quarrels
if
I
can
;
but
I
must
think
over
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
you
need
break
your
heart
over
Gania
,
''
said
the
prince
;
*NL*
``
for
if
what
you
say
is
true
,
he
must
be
considered
dangerous
in
the
*NL*
Epanchin
household
,
and
if
so
,
certain
hopes
of
his
must
have
been
*NL*
encouraged
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
What
hopes
?
''
cried
Colia
;
``
you
surely
do
n't
mean
Aglaya
?
--
oh
,
*NL*
no
!
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
a
dreadful
sceptic
,
prince
,
''
he
continued
,
after
a
moment
's
*NL*
silence
.
``
I
have
observed
of
late
that
you
have
grown
sceptical
about
*NL*
everything
.
You
do
n't
seem
to
believe
in
people
as
you
did
,
and
are
*NL*
always
attributing
motives
and
so
on
--
am
I
using
the
word
`
sceptic
'
in
*NL*
its
proper
sense
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
so
;
but
I
'm
not
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'll
change
it
,
right
or
wrong
;
I
'll
say
that
you
are
not
*NL*
sceptical
,
but
_
jealous
_
.
There
!
you
are
deadly
jealous
of
Gania
,
over
*NL*
a
certain
proud
damsel
!
Come
!
''
Colia
jumped
up
,
with
these
words
,
and
*NL*
burst
out
laughing
.
He
laughed
as
he
had
perhaps
never
laughed
before
,
*NL*
and
still
more
when
he
saw
the
prince
flushing
up
to
his
temples
.
He
was
*NL*
delighted
that
the
prince
should
be
jealous
about
Aglaya
.
However
,
he
*NL*
stopped
immediately
on
seeing
that
the
other
was
really
hurt
,
and
the
*NL*
conversation
continued
,
very
earnestly
,
for
an
hour
or
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
the
prince
had
to
go
to
town
,
on
business
.
Returning
in
the
*NL*
afternoon
,
he
happened
upon
General
Epanchin
at
the
station
.
The
latter
*NL*
seized
his
hand
,
glancing
around
nervously
,
as
if
he
were
afraid
*NL*
of
being
caught
in
wrong-doing
,
and
dragged
him
into
a
first-class
*NL*
compartment
.
He
was
burning
to
speak
about
something
of
importance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
first
place
,
my
dear
prince
,
do
n't
be
angry
with
me
.
I
would
*NL*
have
come
to
see
you
yesterday
,
but
I
did
n't
know
how
Lizabetha
*NL*
Prokofievna
would
take
it
.
My
dear
fellow
,
my
house
is
simply
a
hell
*NL*
just
now
,
a
sort
of
sphinx
has
taken
up
its
abode
there
.
We
live
in
an
*NL*
atmosphere
of
riddles
;
I
ca
n't
make
head
or
tail
of
anything
.
As
for
*NL*
you
,
I
feel
sure
you
are
the
least
to
blame
of
any
of
us
,
though
you
*NL*
certainly
have
been
the
cause
of
a
good
deal
of
trouble
.
You
see
,
it
's
*NL*
all
very
pleasant
to
be
a
philanthropist
;
but
it
can
be
carried
too
far
.
*NL*
Of
course
I
admire
kind-heartedness
,
and
I
esteem
my
wife
,
but
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
general
wandered
on
in
this
disconnected
way
for
a
long
time
;
it
*NL*
was
clear
that
he
was
much
disturbed
by
some
circumstance
which
he
could
*NL*
make
nothing
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
plain
to
me
,
that
_
you
_
are
not
in
it
at
all
,
''
he
continued
,
at
*NL*
last
,
a
little
less
vaguely
,
``
but
perhaps
you
had
better
not
come
to
*NL*
our
house
for
a
little
while
.
I
ask
you
in
the
friendliest
manner
,
*NL*
mind
;
just
till
the
wind
changes
again
.
As
for
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
,
''
he
*NL*
continued
with
some
excitement
,
``
the
whole
thing
is
a
calumny
,
a
dirty
*NL*
calumny
.
It
is
simply
a
plot
,
an
intrigue
,
to
upset
our
plans
and
to
*NL*
stir
up
a
quarrel
.
You
see
,
prince
,
I
'll
tell
you
privately
,
Evgenie
and
*NL*
ourselves
have
not
said
a
word
yet
,
we
have
no
formal
understanding
,
we
*NL*
are
in
no
way
bound
on
either
side
,
but
the
word
may
be
said
very
soon
,
*NL*
do
n't
you
see
,
_
very
_
soon
,
and
all
this
is
most
injurious
,
and
is
meant
*NL*
to
be
so
.
Why
?
I
'm
sure
I
ca
n't
tell
you
.
She
's
an
extraordinary
woman
,
*NL*
you
see
,
an
eccentric
woman
;
I
tell
you
I
am
so
frightened
of
that
woman
*NL*
that
I
ca
n't
sleep
.
What
a
carriage
that
was
,
and
where
did
it
come
*NL*
from
,
eh
?
I
declare
,
I
was
base
enough
to
suspect
Evgenie
at
first
;
but
*NL*
it
seems
certain
that
that
can
not
be
the
case
,
and
if
so
,
why
is
she
*NL*
interfering
here
?
That
's
the
riddle
,
what
does
she
want
?
Is
it
to
keep
*NL*
Evgenie
to
herself
?
But
,
my
dear
fellow
,
I
swear
to
you
,
I
swear
he
*NL*
does
n't
even
_
know
_
her
,
and
as
for
those
bills
,
why
,
the
whole
thing
is
*NL*
an
invention
!
And
the
familiarity
of
the
woman
!
It
's
quite
clear
we
must
*NL*
treat
the
impudent
creature
's
attempt
with
disdain
,
and
redouble
our
*NL*
courtesy
towards
Evgenie
.
I
told
my
wife
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
I
'll
tell
you
my
secret
conviction
.
I
'm
certain
that
she
's
doing
*NL*
this
to
revenge
herself
on
me
,
on
account
of
the
past
,
though
I
assure
*NL*
you
that
all
the
time
I
was
blameless
.
I
blush
at
the
very
idea
.
And
*NL*
now
she
turns
up
again
like
this
,
when
I
thought
she
had
finally
*NL*
disappeared
!
Where
's
Rogojin
all
this
time
?
I
thought
she
was
Mrs.
*NL*
Rogojin
,
long
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
was
in
a
state
of
great
mental
perturbation
.
The
whole
of
*NL*
the
journey
,
which
occupied
nearly
an
hour
,
he
continued
in
this
strain
,
*NL*
putting
questions
and
answering
them
himself
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
,
*NL*
pressing
the
prince
's
hand
,
and
assuring
the
latter
that
,
at
all
*NL*
events
,
he
had
no
suspicion
whatever
of
_
him
_
.
This
last
assurance
was
*NL*
satisfactory
,
at
all
events
.
The
general
finished
by
informing
him
that
*NL*
Evgenie
's
uncle
was
head
of
one
of
the
civil
service
departments
,
and
*NL*
rich
,
very
rich
,
and
a
gourmand
.
``
And
,
well
,
Heaven
preserve
him
,
of
*NL*
course
--
but
Evgenie
gets
his
money
,
do
n't
you
see
?
But
,
for
all
this
,
*NL*
I
'm
uncomfortable
,
I
do
n't
know
why
.
There
's
something
in
the
air
,
I
*NL*
feel
there
's
something
nasty
in
the
air
,
like
a
bat
,
and
I
'm
by
no
means
*NL*
comfortable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
it
was
not
until
the
third
day
that
the
formal
reconciliation
*NL*
between
the
prince
and
the
Epanchins
took
place
,
as
said
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
XII
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
seven
in
the
evening
,
and
the
prince
was
just
preparing
to
go
*NL*
out
for
a
walk
in
the
park
,
when
suddenly
Mrs.
Epanchin
appeared
on
the
*NL*
terrace
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
first
place
,
do
n't
dare
to
suppose
,
''
she
began
,
``
that
I
am
going
*NL*
to
apologize
.
Nonsense
!
You
were
entirely
to
blame
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
remained
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Were
you
to
blame
,
or
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
certainly
not
,
no
more
than
yourself
,
though
at
first
I
thought
I
*NL*
was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
very
well
,
let
's
sit
down
,
at
all
events

for
I
do

intend

*NL*
stand
up
all
day

And
remember
,
if
you
say
,
one
word
about
`
mischievous
*NL*
urchins
,

I
shall
go
away
and
break
with
you
altogether

Now
then
,
did
*NL*
you
,
or
did
you
not
,
send
a
letter
to
Aglaya
,
a
couple
of
months
or
so

ago
,
about
Easter-tide

*NL*
``
Yes
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
for
?
What
was
your
object

Show
me
the
letter

Mrs.
Epanchin
's
*NL*
eyes
flashed
;
she
was
almost
trembling
with
impatience
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
got
the
letter
,
''
said
the
prince
,
timidly
,
extremely
*NL*
surprised
at
the
turn
the
conversation
had
taken
.
``
If
anyone
has
it
,
if
*NL*
it
still
exists
,
Aglaya
Ivanovna
must
have
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
finessing
,
please
.
What
did
you
write
about
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
finessing
,
and
I
am
not
in
the
least
afraid
of
telling
you

I
do
n't
see
the
slightest
reason
why

should
not
have
written

*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
quiet

you
can
talk
afterwards

What
was
the
letter
about
?
Why
are
*NL*
you
blushing
?

*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
was
silent
.
At
last
he
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
your
thoughts

but
I
can
see
*NL*
that
the
fact
of
my
having
written
is
for
some
reason
repugnant
to
you

*NL*
You
must
admit
that
I
have
a
perfect
right
to
refuse
to
answer
your
*NL*
questions
;
but
,
in
order
to
show
you
that
I
am
neither
ashamed
of
*NL*
the
letter
,
nor
sorry
that
I
wrote
it
,

that
I
am
not
in
the
least
*NL*
inclined
to
blush
about
it

-LRB-
here
the
prince
's
blushes
redoubled

,
``
I
*NL*
will
repeat
the
substance

my
letter

know

almost
by

*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
the
prince
repeated
the
letter
almost
word
for
word
,
as
he
*NL*
had
written
it

said
Mrs.
Epanchin

*NL*
cuttingly
,
after
having
listened
with
great
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
really
do
n't
absolutely
know
myself

I
know

feeling

sincere

had
moments
at
that
time
full
of
life

hope

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
sort
of
hope

It

difficult

your

well

in

hopes

future

joy

one
sunny

up
a

wrote

that
letter

why
to

her

I
do

quite
know

Sometimes
one
longs
to
have
a
friend
near

I
evidently
felt
the
need
of

added
the

paused

Are

N-no

flushed
up

up

The

thought
a
moment
.
Then
he
pulled
out
of
his

pocket
*NL*
an
untidy
slip
of
paper
,
on
which
was
scrawled
:

*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Epanchin
reflected
a
moment
.
The
next
minute
she
flew
at
the
*NL*
prince
,
seized
his
hand
,
and
dragged
him
after
her
to
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quick
--
come
along
!
''
she
cried
,
breathless
with
agitation
and
*NL*
impatience
.
``
Come
along
with

*NL*
*NL*
``
But

declared
I

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do

He

She
did
that
because
I
took
your

said

else
she
would
never

such
an

I
dare
say
she
*NL*
was
annoyed

Mrs.

was
dragging
the

the

never
let
go

his

she
added

PART
III
*NL*
*NL*
I
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Epanchin
family
,
or
at
least
the
more
serious
members
of
it
,
were
*NL*
sometimes
grieved
because
they
seemed
so
unlike
the
rest
of
the
world
.
*NL*
They
were
not
quite
certain
,
but
had
at
times
a
strong
suspicion
that
*NL*
things
did
not
happen
to
them
as
they
did
to
other
people
.
Others
led
a
*NL*
quiet
,
uneventful
life
,
while
they
were
subject
to
continual
upheavals
.
*NL*
Others
kept
on
the
rails
without
difficulty
;
they
ran
off
at
the
*NL*
slightest
obstacle
.
Other
houses
were
governed
by
a
timid
routine
;
*NL*
theirs
was
somehow
different
.
Perhaps
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
was
alone
*NL*
in
making
these
fretful
observations
;
the
girls
,
though
not
wanting
in
*NL*
intelligence
,
were
still
young
;
the
general
was
intelligent
,
too
,
but
*NL*
narrow
,
and
in
any
difficulty
he
was
content
to
say
,
``
H
'm
!
''
and
leave
*NL*
the
matter
to
his
wife
.
Consequently
,
on
her
fell
the
responsibility
.
It
*NL*
was
not
that
they
distinguished
themselves
as
a
family
by
any
particular
*NL*
originality
,
or
that
their
excursions
off
the
track
led
to
any
breach
of
*NL*
the
proprieties
.
Oh
no
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
nothing
premeditated
,
there
was
not
even
any
conscious
purpose
*NL*
in
it
all
,
and
yet
,
in
spite
of
everything
,
the
family
,
although
highly
*NL*
respected
,
was
not
quite
what
every
highly
respected
family
ought
to
be
.
*NL*
For
a
long
time
now
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
had
had
it
in
her
mind
that
*NL*
all
the
trouble
was
owing
to
her
``
unfortunate
character
,
''
and
this
*NL*
added
to
her
distress
.
She
blamed
her
own
stupid
unconventional
*NL*
``
eccentricity
.
''
Always
restless
,
always
on
the
go
,
she
constantly
seemed
*NL*
to
lose
her
way
,
and
to
get
into
trouble
over
the
simplest
and
more
*NL*
ordinary
affairs
of
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
said
at
the
beginning
of
our
story
,
that
the
Epanchins
were
liked
*NL*
and
esteemed
by
their
neighbours
.
In
spite
of
his
humble
origin
,
Ivan
*NL*
Fedorovitch
himself
was
received
everywhere
with
respect
.
He
deserved
*NL*
this
,
partly
on
account
of
his
wealth
and
position
,
partly
because
,
*NL*
though
limited
,
he
was
really
a
very
good
fellow
.
But
a
certain
*NL*
limitation
of
mind
seems
to
be
an
indispensable
asset
,
if
not
to
all
*NL*
public
personages
,
at
least
to
all
serious
financiers
.
Added
to
this
,
*NL*
his
manner
was
modest
and
unassuming
;
he
knew
when
to
be
silent
,
yet
*NL*
never
allowed
himself
to
be
trampled
upon
.
Also
--
and
this
was
more
*NL*
important
than
all
--
he
had
the
advantage
of
being
under
exalted
*NL*
patronage
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
,
she
,
as
the
reader
knows
,
belonged
to
an
*NL*
aristocratic
family
.
True
,
Russians
think
more
of
influential
friends
*NL*
than
of
birth
,
but
she
had
both
.
She
was
esteemed
and
even
loved
by
*NL*
people
of
consequence
in
society
,
whose
example
in
receiving
her
was
*NL*
therefore
followed
by
others
.
It
seems
hardly
necessary
to
remark
that
*NL*
her
family
worries
and
anxieties
had
little
or
no
foundation
,
or
that
*NL*
her
imagination
increased
them
to
an
absurd
degree
;
but
if
you
have
a
*NL*
wart
on
your
forehead
or
nose
,
you
imagine
that
all
the
world
is
looking
*NL*
at
it
,
and
that
people
would
make
fun
of
you
because
of
it
,
even
if
you
*NL*
had
discovered
America
!
Doubtless
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
was
considered
*NL*
``
eccentric
''
in
society
,
but
she
was
none
the
less
esteemed
:
the
pity
was
*NL*
that
she
was
ceasing
to
believe
in
that
esteem
.
When
she
thought
of
*NL*
her
daughters
,
she
said
to
herself
sorrowfully
that
she
was
a
hindrance
*NL*
rather
than
a
help
to
their
future
,
that
her
character
and
temper
were
*NL*
absurd
,
ridiculous
,
insupportable
.
Naturally
,
she
put
the
blame
on
her
*NL*
surroundings
,
and
from
morning
to
night
was
quarrelling
with
her
husband
*NL*
and
children
,
whom
she
really
loved
to
the
point
of
self-sacrifice
,
*NL*
even
,
one
might
say
,
of
passion
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
,
above
all
distressed
by
the
idea
that
her
daughters
might
grow
*NL*
up
``
eccentric
,
''
like
herself
;
she
believed
that
no
other
society
girls
*NL*
were
like
them
.
``
They
are
growing
into
Nihilists
!
''
she
repeated
over
and
*NL*
over
again
.
For
years
she
had
tormented
herself
with
this
idea
,
and
with
*NL*
the
question
:
``
Why
do
n't
they
get
married
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
to
annoy
their
mother
;
that
is
their
one
aim
in
life
;
it
can
be
*NL*
nothing
else
.
The
fact
is
it
is
all
of
a
piece
with
these
modern
ideas
,
*NL*
that
wretched
woman
's
question
!
Six
months
ago
Aglaya
took
a
fancy
to
*NL*
cut
off
her
magnificent
hair
.
Why
,
even
I
,
when
I
was
young
,
had
nothing
*NL*
like
it
!
The
scissors
were
in
her
hand
,
and
I
had
to
go
down
on
my
knees
*NL*
and
implore
her
...
She
did
it
,
I
know
,
from
sheer
mischief
,
to
spite
*NL*
her
mother
,
for
she
is
a
naughty
,
capricious
girl
,
a
real
spoiled
child
*NL*
spiteful
and
mischievous
to
a
degree
!
And
then
Alexandra
wanted
to
shave
*NL*
her
head
,
not
from
caprice
or
mischief
,
but
,
like
a
little
fool
,
simply
*NL*
because
Aglaya
persuaded
her
she
would
sleep
better
without
her
hair
,
*NL*
and
not
suffer
from
headache
!
And
how
many
suitors
have
they
not
had
*NL*
during
the
last
five
years
!
Excellent
offers
,
too
!
What
more
do
they
*NL*
want
?
Why
do
n't
they
get
married
?
For
no
other
reason
than
to
vex
their
*NL*
mother
--
none
--
none
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
felt
somewhat
consoled
when
she
could
say
that
*NL*
one
of
her
girls
,
Adelaida
,
was
settled
at
last
.
``
It
will
be
one
off
our
*NL*
hands
!
''
she
declared
aloud
,
though
in
private
she
expressed
herself
with
*NL*
greater
tenderness
.
The
engagement
was
both
happy
and
suitable
,
and
was
*NL*
therefore
approved
in
society
.
Prince
S.
was
a
distinguished
man
,
he
*NL*
had
money
,
and
his
future
wife
was
devoted
to
him
;
what
more
could
*NL*
be
desired
?
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
had
felt
less
anxious
about
this
*NL*
daughter
,
however
,
although
she
considered
her
artistic
tastes
*NL*
suspicious
.
But
to
make
up
for
them
she
was
,
as
her
mother
expressed
it
,
*NL*
``
merry
,
''
and
had
plenty
of
``
common-sense
.
''
It
was
Aglaya
's
future
which
*NL*
disturbed
her
most
.
With
regard
to
her
eldest
daughter
,
Alexandra
,
the
*NL*
mother
never
quite
knew
whether
there
was
cause
for
anxiety
or
not
.
*NL*
Sometimes
she
felt
as
if
there
was
nothing
to
be
expected
from
her
.
She
*NL*
was
twenty-five
now
,
and
must
be
fated
to
be
an
old
maid
,
and
``
with
such
*NL*
beauty
,
too
!
''
The
mother
spent
whole
nights
in
weeping
and
lamenting
,
*NL*
while
all
the
time
the
cause
of
her
grief
slumbered
peacefully
.
``
What
is
*NL*
the
matter
with
her
?
Is
she
a
Nihilist
,
or
simply
a
fool
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
knew
perfectly
well
how
unnecessary
was
the
*NL*
last
question
.
She
set
a
high
value
on
Alexandra
Ivanovna
's
judgment
,
*NL*
and
often
consulted
her
in
difficulties
;
but
that
she
was
a
`
wet
*NL*
hen
'
she
never
for
a
moment
doubted
.
``
She
is
so
calm
;
nothing
rouses
*NL*
her
--
though
wet
hens
are
not
always
calm
!
Oh
!
I
ca
n't
understand
*NL*
it
!
''
Her
eldest
daughter
inspired
Lizabetha
with
a
kind
of
puzzled
*NL*
compassion
.
She
did
not
feel
this
in
Aglaya
's
case
,
though
the
latter
*NL*
was
her
idol
.
It
may
be
said
that
these
outbursts
and
epithets
,
such
as
*NL*
``
wet
hen
''
-LRB-
in
which
the
maternal
solicitude
usually
showed
itself
-RRB-
,
*NL*
only
made
Alexandra
laugh
.
Sometimes
the
most
trivial
thing
annoyed
Mrs.
*NL*
Epanchin
,
and
drove
her
into
a
frenzy
.
For
instance
,
Alexandra
Ivanovna
*NL*
liked
to
sleep
late
,
and
was
always
dreaming
,
though
her
dreams
had
the
*NL*
peculiarity
of
being
as
innocent
and
naive
as
those
of
a
child
of
seven
;
*NL*
and
the
very
innocence
of
her
dreams
annoyed
her
mother
.
Once
she
dreamt
*NL*
of
nine
hens
,
and
this
was
the
cause
of
quite
a
serious
quarrel
--
no
*NL*
one
knew
why
.
Another
time
she
had
--
it
was
most
unusual
--
a
dream
with
*NL*
a
spark
of
originality
in
it
.
She
dreamt
of
a
monk
in
a
dark
room
,
into
*NL*
which
she
was
too
frightened
to
go
.
Adelaida
and
Aglaya
rushed
off
with
*NL*
shrieks
of
laughter
to
relate
this
to
their
mother
,
but
she
was
quite
*NL*
angry
,
and
said
her
daughters
were
all
fools
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
H
'm
!
she
is
as
stupid
as
a
fool
!
A
veritable
`
wet
hen
'
!
Nothing
excites
*NL*
her
;
and
yet
she
is
not
happy
;
some
days
it
makes
one
miserable
only
*NL*
to
look
at
her
!
Why
is
she
unhappy
,
I
wonder
?
''
At
times
Lizabetha
*NL*
Prokofievna
put
this
question
to
her
husband
,
and
as
usual
she
spoke
*NL*
in
the
threatening
tone
of
one
who
demands
an
immediate
answer
.
Ivan
*NL*
Fedorovitch
would
frown
,
shrug
his
shoulders
,
and
at
last
give
his
*NL*
opinion
:
``
She
needs
a
husband
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
forbid
that
he
should
share
your
ideas
,
Ivan
Fedorovitch
!
''
his
wife
*NL*
flashed
back
.
``
Or
that
he
should
be
as
gross
and
churlish
as
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
general
promptly
made
his
escape
,
and
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
after
a
*NL*
while
grew
calm
again
.
That
evening
,
of
course
,
she
would
be
unusually
*NL*
attentive
,
gentle
,
and
respectful
to
her
``
gross
and
churlish
''
husband
,
*NL*
her
``
dear
,
kind
Ivan
Fedorovitch
,
''
for
she
had
never
left
off
loving
*NL*
him
.
She
was
even
still
``
in
love
''
with
him
.
He
knew
it
well
,
and
for
his
*NL*
part
held
her
in
the
greatest
esteem
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
mother
's
great
and
continual
anxiety
was
Aglaya
.
``
She
is
exactly
*NL*
like
me
--
my
image
in
everything
,
''
said
Mrs.
Epanchin
to
herself
.
``
A
*NL*
tyrant
!
A
real
little
demon
!
A
Nihilist
!
Eccentric
,
senseless
and
*NL*
mischievous
!
Good
Lord
,
how
unhappy
she
will
be
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
as
we
said
before
,
the
fact
of
Adelaida
's
approaching
marriage
was
*NL*
balm
to
the
mother
.
For
a
whole
month
she
forgot
her
fears
and
worries
.
*NL*
*NL*
Adelaida
's
fate
was
settled
;
and
with
her
name
that
of
Aglaya
's
was
*NL*
linked
,
in
society
gossip
.
People
whispered
that
Aglaya
,
too
,
was
``
as
*NL*
good
as
engaged
;
''
and
Aglaya
always
looked
so
sweet
and
behaved
so
*NL*
well
-LRB-
during
this
period
-RRB-
,
that
the
mother
's
heart
was
full
of
joy
.
Of
*NL*
course
,
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
must
be
thoroughly
studied
first
,
before
*NL*
the
final
step
should
be
taken
;
but
,
really
,
how
lovely
dear
Aglaya
had
*NL*
become
--
she
actually
grew
more
beautiful
every
day
!
And
then
--
Yes
,
and
*NL*
then
--
this
abominable
prince
showed
his
face
again
,
and
everything
went
*NL*
topsy-turvy
at
once
,
and
everyone
seemed
as
mad
as
March
hares
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
had
really
happened
?
*NL*
*NL*
If
it
had
been
any
other
family
than
the
Epanchins
'
,
nothing
particular
*NL*
would
have
happened
.
But
,
thanks
to
Mrs.
Epanchin
's
invariable
fussiness
*NL*
and
anxiety
,
there
could
not
be
the
slightest
hitch
in
the
simplest
*NL*
matters
of
everyday
life
,
but
she
immediately
foresaw
the
most
dreadful
*NL*
and
alarming
consequences
,
and
suffered
accordingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
then
must
have
been
her
condition
,
when
,
among
all
the
imaginary
*NL*
anxieties
and
calamities
which
so
constantly
beset
her
,
she
now
saw
*NL*
looming
ahead
a
serious
cause
for
annoyance
--
something
really
likely
to
*NL*
arouse
doubts
and
suspicions
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
dared
they
,
how
_
dared
_
they
write
that
hateful
anonymous
letter
*NL*
informing
me
that
Aglaya
is
in
communication
with
Nastasia
Philipovna
?
''
*NL*
she
thought
,
as
she
dragged
the
prince
along
towards
her
own
house
,
*NL*
and
again
when
she
sat
him
down
at
the
round
table
where
the
family
was
*NL*
already
assembled
.
``
How
dared
they
so
much
as
_
think
_
of
such
a
thing
?
I
*NL*
should
_
die
_
with
shame
if
I
thought
there
was
a
particle
of
truth
in
it
,
*NL*
or
if
I
were
to
show
the
letter
to
Aglaya
herself
!
Who
dares
play
these
*NL*
jokes
upon
_
us
_
,
the
Epanchins
?
_
Why
_
did
n't
we
go
to
the
Yelagin
instead
*NL*
of
coming
down
here
?
I
_
told
_
you
we
had
better
go
to
the
Yelagin
this
*NL*
summer
,
Ivan
Fedorovitch
.
It
's
all
your
fault
.
I
dare
say
it
was
that
*NL*
Varia
who
sent
the
letter
.
It
's
all
Ivan
Fedorovitch
.
_
That
_
woman
is
*NL*
doing
it
all
for
him
,
I
know
she
is
,
to
show
she
can
make
a
fool
of
him
*NL*
now
just
as
she
did
when
he
used
to
give
her
pearls
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
after
all
is
said
,
we
are
mixed
up
in
it
.
Your
daughters
are
mixed
*NL*
up
in
it
,
Ivan
Fedorovitch
;
young
ladies
in
society
,
young
ladies
at
an
*NL*
age
to
be
married
;
they
were
present
,
they
heard
everything
there
was
to
*NL*
hear
.
They
were
mixed
up
with
that
other
scene
,
too
,
with
those
dreadful
*NL*
youths
.
You
must
be
pleased
to
remember
they
heard
it
all
.
I
can
not
*NL*
forgive
that
wretched
prince
.
I
never
shall
forgive
him
!
And
why
,
if
you
*NL*
please
,
has
Aglaya
had
an
attack
of
nerves
for
these
last
three
*NL*
days
?
Why
has
she
all
but
quarrelled
with
her
sisters
,
even
with
*NL*
Alexandra
--
whom
she
respects
so
much
that
she
always
kisses
her
hands
as
*NL*
though
she
were
her
mother
?
What
are
all
these
riddles
of
hers
that
we
*NL*
have
to
guess
?
What
has
Gavrila
Ardalionovitch
to
do
with
it
?
Why
did
*NL*
she
take
upon
herself
to
champion
him
this
morning
,
and
burst
into
tears
*NL*
over
it
?
Why
is
there
an
allusion
to
that
cursed
`
poor
knight
'
in
the
*NL*
anonymous
letter
?
And
why
did
I
rush
off
to
him
just
now
like
a
lunatic
,
*NL*
and
drag
him
back
here
?
I
do
believe
I
've
gone
mad
at
last
.
What
on
*NL*
earth
have
I
done
now
?
To
talk
to
a
young
man
about
my
daughter
's
*NL*
secrets
--
and
secrets
having
to
do
with
himself
,
too
!
Thank
goodness
,
*NL*
he
's
an
idiot
,
and
a
friend
of
the
house
!
Surely
Aglaya
has
n't
fallen
in
*NL*
love
with
such
a
gaby
!
What
an
idea
!
Pfu
!
we
ought
all
to
be
put
under
*NL*
glass
cases
--
myself
first
of
all
--
and
be
shown
off
as
curiosities
,
at
*NL*
ten
copecks
a
peep
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
never
forgive
you

never

Look
*NL*
at
her
now

Why
does
n't
she
make
fun
of
him
?
She
said
she
would
,

she
*NL*
does
n't

Look
there
!
She
stares
at
him
with
all
her
eyes

and
does
n't

move
;
and
yet
she
told
him
not
to
come

He
looks
pale
enough
;
and
that
*NL*
abominable
chatterbox
,
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
,
monopolizes
the
whole
of
the
*NL*
conversation
.
Nobody
else
can
get
a
word
in
.
I
could
soon
find
out
all
*NL*
about
everything
if
I
could
only
change
the
subject
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
certainly
was
very
pale
.
He
sat
at
the
table
and
seemed
to
be
*NL*
feeling
,
by
turns
,
sensations
of
alarm
and
rapture
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
,
how
frightened
he
was
of
looking
to
one
side
--
one
particular
*NL*
corner
--
whence
he
knew
very
well
that
a
pair
of
dark
eyes
were
watching
*NL*
him
intently
,
and
how
happy
he
was
to
think
that
he
was
once
more
among
*NL*
them
,
and
occasionally
hearing
that
well-known
voice
,
although
she
had
*NL*
written
and
forbidden
him
to
come
again
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
on
earth
will
she
say
to
me
,
I
wonder
?
''
he
thought
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
not
said
a
word
yet
;
he
sat
silent
and
listened
to
Evgenie
*NL*
Pavlovitch
's
eloquence
.
The
latter
had
never
appeared
so
happy
and
*NL*
excited
as
on
this
evening
.
The
prince
listened
to
him
,
but
for
a
long
*NL*
time
did
not
take
in
a
word
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Excepting
Ivan
Fedorovitch
,
who
had
not
as
yet
returned
from
town
,
the
*NL*
whole
family
was
present
.
Prince
S.
was
there
;
and
they
all
intended
to
*NL*
go
out
to
hear
the
band
very
soon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Colia
arrived
presently
and
joined
the
circle
.
``
So
he
is
received
as
*NL*
usual
,
after
all
,
''
thought
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Epanchins
'
country-house
was
a
charming
building
,
built
after
the
*NL*
model
of
a
Swiss
chalet
,
and
covered
with
creepers
.
It
was
surrounded
on
*NL*
all
sides
by
a
flower
garden
,
and
the
family
sat
,
as
a
rule
,
on
the
open
*NL*
verandah
as
at
the
prince
's
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
subject
under
discussion
did
not
appear
to
be
very
popular
with
the
*NL*
assembly
,
and
some
would
have
been
delighted
to
change
it
;
but
Evgenie
*NL*
would
not
stop
holding
forth
,
and
the
prince
's
arrival
seemed
to
spur
*NL*
him
on
to
still
further
oratorical
efforts
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
frowned
,
but
had
not
as
yet
grasped
the
subject
,
*NL*
which
seemed
to
have
arisen
out
of
a
heated
argument
.
Aglaya
sat
apart
,
*NL*
almost
in
the
corner
,
listening
in
stubborn
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
''
continued
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
hotly
,
``
I
do
n't
say
a
word
*NL*
against
liberalism
.
Liberalism
is
not
a
sin
,
it
is
a
necessary
part
of
*NL*
a
great
whole
,
which
whole
would
collapse
and
fall
to
pieces
without
*NL*
it
.
Liberalism
has
just
as
much
right
to
exist
as
has
the
most
moral
*NL*
conservatism
;
but
I
am
attacking
_
Russian
_
liberalism
;
and
I
attack
it
for
*NL*
the
simple
reason
that
a
Russian
liberal
is
not
a
Russian
liberal
,
he
is
*NL*
a
non-Russian
liberal
.
Show
me
a
real
Russian
liberal
,
and
I
'll
kiss
him
*NL*
before
you
all
,
with
pleasure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
he
cared
to
kiss
you
,
that
is
,
''
said
Alexandra
,
whose
cheeks
were
*NL*
red
with
irritation
and
excitement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
at
that
,
now
,
''
thought
the
mother
to
herself
,
``
she
does
nothing
*NL*
but
sleep
and
eat
for
a
year
at
a
time
,
and
then
suddenly
flies
out
in
*NL*
the
most
incomprehensible
way
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
observed
that
Alexandra
appeared
to
be
angry
with
Evgenie
,
*NL*
because
he
spoke
on
a
serious
subject
in
a
frivolous
manner
,
pretending
*NL*
to
be
in
earnest
,
but
with
an
under-current
of
irony
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
saying
just
now
,
before
you
came
in
,
prince
,
that
there
has
*NL*
been
nothing
national
up
to
now
,
about
our
liberalism
,
and
nothing
the
*NL*
liberals
do
,
or
have
done
,
is
in
the
least
degree
national
.
They
are
*NL*
drawn
from
two
classes
only
,
the
old
landowning
class
,
and
clerical
*NL*
families
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
,
nothing
that
they
have
done
is
Russian
?
''
asked
Prince
S.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
may
be
Russian
,
but
it
is
not
national
.
Our
liberals
are
not
*NL*
Russian
,
nor
are
our
conservatives
,
and
you
may
be
sure
that
the
nation
*NL*
does
not
recognize
anything
that
has
been
done
by
the
landed
gentry
,
or
*NL*
by
the
seminarists
,
or
what
is
to
be
done
either
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
that
's
good
!
How
can
you
maintain
such
a
paradox
?
If
you
are
*NL*
serious
,
that
is
.
I
can
not
allow
such
a
statement
about
the
landed
*NL*
proprietors
to
pass
unchallenged
.
Why
,
you
are
a
landed
proprietor
*NL*
yourself
!
''
cried
Prince
S.
hotly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
'll
say
there
is
nothing
national
about
our
literature
*NL*
either
?
''
said
Alexandra
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
am
not
a
great
authority
on
literary
questions
,
but
I
*NL*
certainly
do
hold
that
Russian
literature
is
not
Russian
,
except
perhaps
*NL*
Lomonosoff
,
Pouschkin
and
Gogol
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
first
place
,
that
is
a
considerable
admission
,
and
in
the
second
*NL*
place
,
one
of
the
above
was
a
peasant
,
and
the
other
two
were
both
*NL*
landed
proprietors
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
so
,
but
do
n't
be
in
such
a
hurry
!
For
since
it
has
been
the
part
*NL*
of
these
three
men
,
and
only
these
three
,
to
say
something
absolutely
*NL*
their
own
,
not
borrowed
,
so
by
this
very
fact
these
three
men
become
*NL*
really
national
.
If
any
Russian
shall
have
done
or
said
anything
really
*NL*
and
absolutely
original
,
he
is
to
be
called
national
from
that
moment
,
*NL*
though
he
may
not
be
able
to
talk
the
Russian
language
;
still
he
is
a
*NL*
national
Russian
.
I
consider
that
an
axiom
.
But
we
were
not
speaking
*NL*
of
literature
;
we
began
by
discussing
the
socialists
.
Very
well
then
,
*NL*
I
insist
that
there
does
not
exist
one
single
Russian
socialist
.
There
*NL*
does
not
,
and
there
has
never
existed
such
a
one
,
because
all
socialists
*NL*
are
derived
from
the
two
classes
--
the
landed
proprietors
,
and
the
*NL*
seminarists
.
All
our
eminent
socialists
are
merely
old
liberals
of
*NL*
the
class
of
landed
proprietors
,
men
who
were
liberals
in
the
days
of
*NL*
serfdom
.
Why
do
you
laugh
?
Give
me
their
books
,
give
me
their
studies
,
*NL*
their
memoirs
,
and
though
I
am
not
a
literary
critic
,
yet
I
will
prove
*NL*
as
clear
as
day
that
every
chapter
and
every
word
of
their
writings
has
*NL*
been
the
work
of
a
former
landed
proprietor
of
the
old
school
.
You
'll
*NL*
find
that
all
their
raptures
,
all
their
generous
transports
are
*NL*
proprietary
,
all
their
woes
and
their
tears
,
proprietary
;
all
*NL*
proprietary
or
seminarist
!
You
are
laughing
again
,
and
you
,
prince
,
are
*NL*
smiling
too
.
Do
n't
you
agree
with
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
true
enough
that
everybody
was
laughing
,
the
prince
among
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
tell
you
on
the
instant
whether
I
agree
with
you
or
not
,
''
*NL*
said
the
latter
,
suddenly
stopping
his
laughter
,
and
starting
like
a
*NL*
schoolboy
caught
at
mischief
.
``
But
,
I
assure
you
,
I
am
listening
to
you
*NL*
with
extreme
gratification
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
he
almost
panted
with
agitation
,
and
a
cold
sweat
stood
upon
*NL*
his
forehead
.
These
were
his
first
words
since
he
had
entered
the
house
;
*NL*
he
tried
to
lift
his
eyes
,
and
look
around
,
but
dared
not
;
Evgenie
*NL*
Pavlovitch
noticed
his
confusion
,
and
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
just
tell
you
one
fact
,
ladies
and
gentlemen
,
''
continued
the
*NL*
latter
,
with
apparent
seriousness
and
even
exaltation
of
manner
,
but
*NL*
with
a
suggestion
of
``
chaff
''
behind
every
word
,
as
though
he
were
*NL*
laughing
in
his
sleeve
at
his
own
nonsense
--
``
a
fact
,
the
discovery
*NL*
of
which
,
I
believe
,
I
may
claim
to
have
made
by
myself
alone
.
At
all
*NL*
events
,
no
other
has
ever
said
or
written
a
word
about
it
;
and
in
this
*NL*
fact
is
expressed
the
whole
essence
of
Russian
liberalism
of
the
sort
*NL*
which
I
am
now
considering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
first
place
,
what
is
liberalism
,
speaking
generally
,
but
an
*NL*
attack
-LRB-
whether
mistaken
or
reasonable
,
is
quite
another
question
-RRB-
upon
*NL*
the
existing
order
of
things
?
Is
this
so
?
Yes
.
Very
well
.
Then
my
`
fact
'
*NL*
consists
in
this
,
that
_
Russian
_
liberalism
is
not
an
attack
upon
the
*NL*
existing
order
of
things
,
but
an
attack
upon
the
very
essence
of
things
*NL*
themselves
--
indeed
,
on
the
things
themselves
;
not
an
attack
on
the
*NL*
Russian
order
of
things
,
but
on
Russia
itself
.
My
Russian
liberal
*NL*
goes
so
far
as
to
reject
Russia
;
that
is
,
he
hates
and
strikes
his
own
*NL*
mother
.
Every
misfortune
and
mishap
of
the
mother-country
fills
him
with
*NL*
mirth
,
and
even
with
ecstasy
.
He
hates
the
national
customs
,
Russian
*NL*
history
,
and
everything
.
If
he
has
a
justification
,
it
is
that
he
does
*NL*
not
know
what
he
is
doing
,
and
believes
that
his
hatred
of
Russia
is
the
*NL*
grandest
and
most
profitable
kind
of
liberalism
.
-LRB-
You
will
often
find
*NL*
a
liberal
who
is
applauded
and
esteemed
by
his
fellows
,
but
who
is
in
*NL*
reality
the
dreariest
,
blindest
,
dullest
of
conservatives
,
and
is
not
*NL*
aware
of
the
fact
.
-RRB-
This
hatred
for
Russia
has
been
mistaken
by
some
of
*NL*
our
`
Russian
liberals
'
for
sincere
love
of
their
country
,
and
they
*NL*
boast
that
they
see
better
than
their
neighbours
what
real
love
of
one
's
*NL*
country
should
consist
in
.
But
of
late
they
have
grown
,
more
candid
and
*NL*
are
ashamed
of
the
expression
`
love
of
country
,
'
and
have
annihilated
*NL*
the
very
spirit
of
the
words
as
something
injurious
and
petty
and
*NL*
undignified
.
This
is
the
truth
,
and
I
hold
by
it
;
but
at
the
same
time
*NL*
it
is
a
phenomenon
which
has
not
been
repeated
at
any
other
time
or
*NL*
place
;
and
therefore
,
though
I
hold
to
it
as
a
fact
,
yet
I
recognize
*NL*
that
it
is
an
accidental
phenomenon
,
and
may
likely
enough
pass
away
.
*NL*
There
can
be
no
such
thing
anywhere
else
as
a
liberal
who
really
hates
*NL*
his
country
;
and
how
is
this
fact
to
be
explained
among
_
us
?
_
By
*NL*
my
original
statement
that
a
Russian
liberal
is
_
not
_
a
_
Russian
_
*NL*
liberal
--
that
's
the
only
explanation
that
I
can
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
take
all
that
you
have
said
as
a
joke
,
''
said
Prince
S.
seriously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
seen
all
kinds
of
liberals
,
and
can
not
,
therefore
,
set
*NL*
myself
up
as
a
judge
,
''
said
Alexandra
,
``
but
I
have
heard
all
you
have
*NL*
said
with
indignation
.
You
have
taken
some
accidental
case
and
twisted
*NL*
it
into
a
universal
law
,
which
is
unjust
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Accidental
case
!
''
said
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
.
``
Do
you
consider
it
an
*NL*
accidental
case
,
prince
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
also
admit
,
''
said
the
prince
,
``
that
I
have
not
seen
much
,
or
*NL*
been
very
far
into
the
question
;
but
I
can
not
help
thinking
that
you
are
*NL*
more
or
less
right
,
and
that
Russian
liberalism
--
that
phase
of
it
which
*NL*
you
are
considering
,
at
least
--
really
is
sometimes
inclined
to
hate
*NL*
Russia
itself
,
and
not
only
its
existing
order
of
things
in
general
.
Of
*NL*
course
this
is
only
_
partially
_
the
truth
;
you
can
not
lay
down
the
law
for
*NL*
all
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
blushed
and
broke
off
,
without
finishing
what
he
meant
to
*NL*
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
his
shyness
and
agitation
,
he
could
not
help
being
greatly
*NL*
interested
in
the
conversation
.
A
special
characteristic
of
his
was
*NL*
the
naive
candour
with
which
he
always
listened
to
arguments
which
*NL*
interested
him
,
and
with
which
he
answered
any
questions
put
to
him
on
*NL*
the
subject
at
issue
.
In
the
very
expression
of
his
face
this
naivete
*NL*
was
unmistakably
evident
,
this
disbelief
in
the
insincerity
of
others
,
*NL*
and
unsuspecting
disregard
of
irony
or
humour
in
their
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
though
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
had
put
his
questions
to
the
prince
with
*NL*
no
other
purpose
but
to
enjoy
the
joke
of
his
simple-minded
seriousness
,
*NL*
yet
now
,
at
his
answer
,
he
was
surprised
into
some
seriousness
himself
,
*NL*
and
looked
gravely
at
Muishkin
as
though
he
had
not
expected
that
sort
*NL*
of
answer
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
how
strange
!
''
he
ejaculated
.
``
You
did
n't
answer
me
seriously
,
*NL*
surely
,
did
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
not
you
ask
me
the
question
seriously
''
inquired
the
prince
,
in
*NL*
amazement
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everybody
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
trust
_
him
_
for
that
!
''
said
Adelaida
.
``
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
turns
*NL*
everything
and
everybody
he
can
lay
hold
of
to
ridicule
.
You
should
hear
*NL*
the
things
he
says
sometimes
,
apparently
in
perfect
seriousness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
my
opinion
the
conversation
has
been
a
painful
one
throughout
,
and
*NL*
we
ought
never
to
have
begun
it
,

said
Alexandra
.
``
We
were
all
going
for
*NL*
a
walk

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
along
then

''
said
Evgenie
;
``
it
's
a
glorious
evening
.
But
,
to
prove
*NL*
that
this
time
I
was
speaking
absolutely
seriously
,
and
especially
*NL*
to
prove
this
to
the
prince
-LRB-
for
you

have
interested
me
*NL*
exceedingly
,

I
swear
to
you
that
I
am
not
quite
such

*NL*
I

will
you
allow

to
put
just
one
more
*NL*
question
to
the
prince

out
of
pure
curiosity

It
shall
be
the
last

*NL*
This
question
came
into
my
mind
a
couple
of
hours
since
-LRB-
you
see
,
*NL*
prince

I
do
think
seriously
at
times
-RRB-
,

I
made
my
own
decision
upon
*NL*
it
;
now
I
wish
to
hear
what
the
prince
will
say
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
just
used
the
expression
`
accidental
case
.
'
This
is
a
*NL*
significant
phrase
;
we
often
hear
it
.
Well
,
not
long
since
everyone
was
*NL*
talking
and
reading
about
that
terrible
murder
of
six
people
on
the
part
*NL*
of
a
--
young
fellow
,
and
of
the
extraordinary
speech
of
the
counsel
for
*NL*
the
defence
,
who
observed
that
in
the
poverty-stricken
condition
of
the
*NL*
criminal
it
must
have
come
_
naturally
_
into
his
head
to
kill
these
six
*NL*
people
.
I
do
not
quote
his
words
,
but
that
is
the
sense
of
them
,
or
*NL*
something
very
like
it
.
Now
,
in
my
opinion
,
the
barrister
who
put
*NL*
forward
this
extraordinary
plea
was
probably
absolutely
convinced
that
*NL*
he
was
stating
the
most
liberal
,
the
most
humane
,
the
most
enlightened
*NL*
view
of
the
case
that
could
possibly
be
brought
forward
in
these
days
.
*NL*
Now
,
was
this
distortion
,
this
capacity
for
a
perverted
way
of
viewing
*NL*
things
,
a
special
or
accidental
case
,
or
is
such
a
general
rule
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Everyone
laughed
at
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
special

accidental

cried
Alexandra
and
Adelaida

*NL*
*NL*
``

me
remind

once
more

Prince

observing

serious

fixed
upon

put

*NL*
``
No

quietly

firmly

cried
Prince

with
some
annoyance
,
``

n't
you

simply
laughing
at

to
make

game
of
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
Evgenie

was
talking
seriously

said
the
prince
,
*NL*
blushing
and
dropping
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
prince
,
''
continued
Prince
S.
``
remember
what
you
and
I
were
*NL*
saying
two
or
three
months
ago
.
We
spoke
of
the
fact
that
in
our
newly
*NL*
opened
Law
Courts
one
could
already
lay
one
's
finger
upon
so
many
*NL*
talented
and
remarkable
young
barristers
.
How
pleased
you
were
with
*NL*
the
state
of
things
as
we
found
it
,
and
how
glad
I
was
to
observe
your
*NL*
delight
!
We
both
said
it
was
a
matter
to
be
proud
of
;
but
this
clumsy
*NL*
defence
that
Evgenie
mentions
,
this
strange
argument
_
can
_
,
of
course
,
*NL*
only
be
an
accidental
case

one
in
a
thousand
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
reflected
a
little
,
but
very
soon
he
replied
,
with
absolute
*NL*
conviction
in
his
tone
,
though
he
still
spoke
somewhat
shyly
and
*NL*
timidly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only
wished
to
say
that
this
`
distortion
,
'
as
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
*NL*
expressed
it
,
is
met
with
very
often
,
and
is
far
more
the
general
rule
*NL*
than
the
exception
,
unfortunately
for
Russia
.
So
much
so
,
that
if
this
*NL*
distortion
were
not
the
general
rule
,
perhaps
these
dreadful
crimes
*NL*
would
be
less
frequent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dreadful
crimes
?
But
I
can
assure
you
that
crimes
just
as
dreadful
,
*NL*
and
probably
more
horrible
,
have
occurred
before
our
times
,
and
at
all
*NL*
times
,
and
not
only
here
in
Russia
,
but
everywhere
else
as
well
.
And
in
*NL*
my
opinion
it
is
not
at
all
likely
that
such
murders
will
cease
to
occur
*NL*
for
a
very
long
time
to
come
.
The
only
difference
is
that
in
former
*NL*
times
there
was
less
publicity
,
while
now
everyone
talks
and
writes
*NL*
freely
about
such
things
--
which
fact
gives
the
impression
that
such
*NL*
crimes
have
only
now
sprung
into
existence
.
That
is
where
your
mistake
*NL*
lies
--
an
extremely
natural
mistake
,
I
assure
you
,
my
dear
fellow
!

said

Prince
S.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
that
there
were
just
as
many
,
and
just
as
terrible
,
crimes
*NL*
before
our
times
.
Not
long
since
I
visited
a
convict
prison
and
made
*NL*
acquaintance
with
some
of
the
criminals
.
There
were
some
even
more
*NL*
dreadful
criminals
than
this
one
we
have
been
speaking
of
--
men
who
*NL*
have
murdered
a
dozen
of
their
fellow-creatures
,
and
feel
no
remorse
*NL*
whatever
.
But
what
I
especially
noticed
was
this
,
that
the
very
most
*NL*
hopeless
and
remorseless
murderer
--
however
hardened
a
criminal
he
may
*NL*
be
--
still
_
knows
that
he
is
a
criminal
_

that
is
,
he
is
conscious
that
*NL*
he
has
acted
wickedly
,
though
he
may
feel
no
remorse
whatever

And
they
*NL*
were
all
like
this

Those
of
whom
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
has
spoken
,
do
not
*NL*
admit
that
they
are
criminals
at
all
;
they
think
they
had
a
right
to
*NL*
do
what
they
did
,
and
that
they
were
even
doing
a
good
deed
,
perhaps
.
*NL*
I
consider
there
is
the
greatest
difference
between
the
two
cases

*NL*
And
recollect
--
it
was
a
_
youth
_

at
the
particular
age
which
is
most
*NL*
helplessly
susceptible
to
the
distortion
of
ideas

*NL*
*NL*

now
no

smiling

he
gazed
at

bewilderment

Alexandra

who

seemed

*NL*
change
her
mind

Evgenie

gazed
at

real

his

to
town
,
you
know
you
*NL*
did
--
you
said
so
yourself
!
Now
then
,
did
you
,
or
did
you
not
,
go
down
on
*NL*
your
knees
and
beg
him
to
come
,
confess
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
he
did
n't
,
for
I
saw
it
all
myself
,
''
said
Colia
.
``
On
the
contrary
,
*NL*
Hippolyte
kissed
his
hand
twice
and
thanked
him
;
and
all
the
prince
said
*NL*
was
that
he
thought
Hippolyte
might
feel
better
here
in
the
country
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
,
Colia
,
--
what
is
the
use
of
saying
all
that
?
''
cried
the
prince
,
*NL*
rising
and
taking
his
hat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
you
going
to
now
?
''
cried
Mrs.
Epanchin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
about
him
now
,
prince
,
''
said
Colia
.
``
He
is
all
right
and
*NL*
taking
a
nap
after
the
journey
.
He
is
very
happy
to
be
here
;
but
I
think
*NL*
perhaps
it
would
be
better
if
you
let
him
alone
for
today
,
--
he
is
very
*NL*
sensitive
now
that
he
is
so
ill
--
and
he
might
be
embarrassed
if
you
show
*NL*
him
too
much
attention
at
first
.
He
is
decidedly
better
today
,
and
says
*NL*
he
has
not
felt
so
well
for
the
last
six
months
,
and
has
coughed
much
*NL*
less
,
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
observed
that
Aglaya
came
out
of
her
corner
and
approached
*NL*
the
table
at
this
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
dare
look
at
her
,
but
he
was
conscious
,
to
the
very
tips
of
*NL*
his
fingers
,
that
she
was
gazing
at
him
,
perhaps
angrily
;
and
that
she
*NL*
had
probably
flushed
up
with
a
look
of
fiery
indignation
in
her
black
*NL*
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
to
me
,
Mr.
Colia
,
that
you
were
very
foolish
to
bring
your
*NL*
young
friend
down
--
if
he
is
the
same
consumptive
boy
who
wept
so
*NL*
profusely
,
and
invited
us
all
to
his
own
funeral
,
''
remarked
Evgenie
*NL*
Pavlovitch
.
``
He
talked
so
eloquently
about
the
blank
wall
outside
his
*NL*
bedroom
window
,
that
I
'm
sure
he
will
never
support
life
here
without
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
so
too
,
''
said
Mrs.
Epanchin
;
``
he
will
quarrel
with
you
,
and
be
*NL*
off
,
''
and
she
drew
her
workbox
towards
her
with
an
air
of
dignity
,
quite
*NL*
oblivious
of
the
fact
that
the
family
was
about
to
start
for
a
walk
in
*NL*
the
park
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
remember
he
boasted
about
the
blank
wall
in
an
extraordinary
*NL*
way
,
''
continued
Evgenie
,
``
and
I
feel
that
without
that
blank
wall
*NL*
he
will
never
be
able
to
die
eloquently
;
and
he
does
so
long
to
die
*NL*
eloquently
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
must
forgive
him
the
blank
wall

said
the
prince
,
quietly
.
``
He
*NL*
has
come
down
to
see
a
few
trees
now
,
poor
fellow

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
forgive
him
with
all
my
heart
;
you
may
tell
him
so
if
you
like

*NL*
laughed
Evgenie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
you
should
take
it
quite
like
that
,
''
said
the
prince
,
*NL*
quietly
,
and
without
removing
his
eyes
from
the
carpet
.
``
I
think
it
is
*NL*
more
a
case
of
his
forgiving
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forgiving
me
!
why
so
?
What
have
I
done
to
need
his
forgiveness
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
do
n't
understand
,
then

but
of
course
,
you
do
understand

*NL*
He
wished
--
he
wished
to
bless
you
all
round
and
to
have
your
*NL*
blessing
--
before
he
died
--
that
's
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
prince
,
''
began
Prince
S.
,
hurriedly
,
exchanging
glances
with
*NL*
some
of
those
present
,
``
you
will
not
easily
find
heaven
on
earth
,
and
*NL*
yet
you
seem
to
expect
to
.
Heaven
is
a
difficult
thing
to
find
anywhere
,
*NL*
prince
;
far
more
difficult
than
appears
to
that
good
heart
of
yours
.
*NL*
Better
stop
this
conversation
,
or
we
shall
all
be
growing
quite
*NL*
disturbed
in
our
minds
,
and
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
go
and
hear
the
band
,
then
,
''
said
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
,
angrily
*NL*
rising
from
her
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rest
of
the
company
followed
her
example
.
*NL*
*NL*
II
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
suddenly
approached
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
,
''
he
said
,
with
strange
excitement
and
seizing
the
*NL*
latter
's
hand
in
his
own
,
``
be
assured
that
I
esteem
you
as
a
generous
*NL*
and
honourable
man
,
in
spite
of
everything

Be
assured
of
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
fell
back
a
step
in
astonishment
.
For
one
moment
it
*NL*
was
all
he
could
do
to
restrain
himself
from
bursting
out
laughing
;
but
,
*NL*
looking
closer
,
he
observed
that
the
prince
did
not
seem
to
be
quite
*NL*
himself
;
at
all
events
,
he
was
in
a
very
curious
state
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
n't
mind
betting
,
prince
,
''
he
cried
,
``
that
you
did
not
in
the
*NL*
least
mean
to
say
that
,
and
very
likely
you
meant
to
address
someone
*NL*
else
altogether
.
What
is
it
?
Are
you
feeling
unwell
or
anything
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
likely
,
extremely
likely
,
and
you
must
be
a
very
close
observer
to
*NL*
detect
the
fact
that
perhaps
I
did
not
intend
to
come
up
to
_
you
_
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
he
smiled
strangely
;
but
suddenly
and
excitedly
he
began
*NL*
again
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
remind
me
of
what
I
have
done
or
said
.
Do
n't
!
I
am
very
much
*NL*
ashamed
of
myself

I

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
have
you
done

I
do
n't
understand
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
you
are
ashamed
of
me
,
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
;
you
are
blushing
for
*NL*
me
;
that
's
a
sign
of
a
good
heart
.
Do
n't
be
afraid
;
I
shall
go
away
*NL*
directly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
with
him
?
Do
his
fits
begin
like
that
?
''
said
*NL*
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
,
in
a
high
state
of
alarm
,
addressing
Colia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
,
take
no
notice
of
me
.
I
am
not
going
to
*NL*
have
a
fit
.
I
will
go
away
directly
;
but
I
know
I
am
afflicted
.
I
was
*NL*
twenty-four
years
an
invalid
,
you
see
--
the
first
twenty-four
years
of
my
*NL*
life
--
so
take
all
I
do
and
say
as
the
sayings
and
actions
of
an
*NL*
invalid
.
I
'm
going
away
directly
,
I
really
am
--
do
n't
be
afraid
.
I
am
*NL*
not
blushing
,
for
I
do
n't
think
I
need
blush
about
it
,
need
I
?
But
I
see
*NL*
that
I
am
out
of
place
in
society
--
society
is
better
without
me
.
It
's
*NL*
not
vanity
,
I
assure
you
.
I
have
thought
over
it
all
these
last
three
*NL*
days
,
and
I
have
made
up
my
mind
that
I
ought
to
unbosom
myself
candidly
*NL*
before
you
at
the
first
opportunity
.
There
are
certain
things
,
certain
*NL*
great
ideas
,
which
I
must
not
so
much
as
approach
,
as
Prince
S.
has
*NL*
just
reminded
me
,
or
I
shall
make
you
all
laugh
.
I
have
no
sense
of
*NL*
proportion
,
I
know
;
my
words
and
gestures
do
not
express
my
ideas
--
they
*NL*
are
a
humiliation
and
abasement
of
the
ideas
,
and
therefore
,
I
have
no
*NL*
right
--
and
I
am
too
sensitive
.
Still
,
I
believe
I
am
beloved
in
this
*NL*
household
,
and
esteemed
far
more
than
I
deserve
.
But
I
ca
n't
help
*NL*
knowing
that
after
twenty-four
years
of
illness
there
must
be
some
trace
*NL*
left
,
so
that
it
is
impossible
for
people
to
refrain
from
laughing
at
me
*NL*
sometimes
;
do
n't
you
think
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
seemed
to
pause
for
a
reply
,
for
some
verdict
,
as
it
were
,
and
looked
*NL*
humbly
around
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
present
stood
rooted
to
the
earth
with
amazement
at
this
unexpected
*NL*
and
apparently
uncalled-for
outbreak
;
but
the
poor
prince
's
painful
and
*NL*
rambling
speech
gave
rise
to
a
strange
episode
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
say
all
this
here
?
''
cried
Aglaya
,
suddenly
.
``
Why
do
you
talk
*NL*
like
this
to
_
them
?
_
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
appeared
to
be
in
the
last
stages
of
wrath
and
irritation
;
her
eyes
*NL*
flashed
.
The
prince
stood
dumbly
and
blindly
before
her
,
and
suddenly
*NL*
grew
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
not
one
of
them
all
who
is
worthy
of
these
words
of
yours
,
''
*NL*
continued
Aglaya
.
``
Not
one
of
them
is
worth
your
little
finger
,
not
one
*NL*
of
them
has
heart
or
head
to
compare
with
yours
!
You
are
more
honest
*NL*
than
all
,
and
better
,
nobler
,
kinder
,
wiser
than
all
.
There
are
some
*NL*
here
who
are
unworthy
to
bend
and
pick
up
the
handkerchief
you
have
just
*NL*
dropped
.
Why
do
you
humiliate
yourself
like
this
,
and
place
yourself
*NL*
lower
than
these
people
?
Why
do
you
debase
yourself
before
them
?
Why
*NL*
have
you
no
pride
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
God
!
Who
would
ever
have
believed
this
?

cried
Mrs.
Epanchin
,
*NL*
wringing
her
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hurrah
for
the
`
poor
knight
'
!
''
cried
Colia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
quiet
!
How
dare
they
laugh
at
me
in
your
house
?
''
said
Aglaya
,
*NL*
turning
sharply
on
her
mother
in
that
hysterical
frame
of
mind
that
*NL*
rides
recklessly
over
every
obstacle
and
plunges
blindly
through
*NL*
proprieties
.
``
Why
does
everyone
,
everyone
worry
and
torment
me

Why
have
*NL*
they
all
been
bullying
me
these
three
days
about
you

I
will

not

never

Just
look
in

the
glass
and
see
what
you
look
like

this
very
moment

Why

why

do
they
*NL*
torment
me
and
say
I
am
going
to
marry

You
must
know
it

are
in

the
plot
with

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

ever
tormented

on
the
subject

murmured
Adelaida
,
aghast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

ever
thought

cried
Alexandra

*NL*
*NL*
``
Who

Is

raving

cried
Lizabetha
*NL*
Prokofievna
,
trembling
with
rage
,
to
the
company
in
general
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Every

I

never

never

*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
Aglaya
burst
into
bitter
tears
,
and
,
hiding
her
face
in
her
*NL*
handkerchief
,
sank
back
into
a
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
he
has
never

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
never

said
the
prince
,
*NL*
of
a
sudden
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
What
?
_
''
cried
Mrs.
Epanchin
,
raising
her
hands
in
horror
.
''
_
What
's
_
*NL*
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
not
believe
her
ears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
meant
to
say
--
I
only
meant
to
say
,
''
said
the
prince
,
faltering
,
*NL*
``
I
merely
meant
to
explain
to
Aglaya
Ivanovna

to
have
the
honour
to
*NL*
explain

it
were

that
I
had
no

never

to
ask
the

I
assure
you
I
am
not
guilty

Aglaya

I
*NL*
am
not

indeed

I
never

*NL*
never

you
'll
see

yourself

you
may
be
quite
assured
of
it

*NL*
Some
wicked
person
has
been
maligning
me
to
you
;
but
it
's
all
right
.
*NL*
Do
n't
worry
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
the
prince
approached
Aglaya
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
the
handkerchief
from
her
face
,
glanced
keenly
at
him
,
took
*NL*
in
what
he
had
said
,
and
burst
out
laughing
--
such
a
merry
,
unrestrained
*NL*
laugh
,
so
hearty
and
gay
,
that
.
Adelaida
could
not
contain
herself
.
She
,
*NL*
too
,
glanced
at
the
prince
's
panic-stricken
countenance
,
then
rushed
at
*NL*
her
sister
,
threw
her
arms
round
her
neck
,
and
burst
into
as
merry
a
*NL*
fit
of
laughter
as
Aglaya
's
own
.
They
laughed
together
like
a
couple
of
*NL*
school-girls
.
Hearing
and
seeing
this
,
the
prince
smiled
happily
,
and
in
*NL*
accents
of
relief
and
joy
,
he
exclaimed
``
Well
,
thank
God
--
thank
God
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
now
joined
in
,
and
it
looked
as
though
the
three
sisters
were
*NL*
going
to
laugh
on
for
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
insane
,
''
muttered
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
.
``
Either
they
frighten
*NL*
one
out
of
one
's
wits
,
or
else
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Prince
S.
was
laughing
now
,
too
,
so
was
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
,
so
was
*NL*
Colia
,
and
so
was
the
prince
himself
,
who
caught
the
infection
as
he
*NL*
looked
round
radiantly
upon
the
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
along
,
let
's
go
out
for
a
walk
!
''
cried
Adelaida
.
``
We
'll
all
go
*NL*
together
,
and
the
prince
must
absolutely
go
with
us
.
You
need
n't
go
*NL*
away
,
you
dear
good
fellow
!
_
Is
n't
_
he
a
dear
,
Aglaya
?
Is
n't
he
,
mother
?
I
*NL*
must
really
give
him
a
kiss
for
--
for
his
explanation
to
Aglaya
just
now
.
*NL*
Mother
,
dear
,
I
may
kiss
him
,
may
n't
I
?
Aglaya
,
may
I
kiss
_
your
_
prince
?
''
*NL*
cried
the
young
rogue
,
and
sure
enough
she
skipped
up
to
the
prince
and
*NL*
kissed
his
forehead
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
seized
her
hands
,
and
pressed
them
so
hard
that
Adelaida
nearly
cried
*NL*
out
;
he
then
gazed
with
delight
into
her
eyes
,
and
raising
her
right
*NL*
hand
to
his
lips
with
enthusiasm
,
kissed
it
three
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
along
,
''
said
Aglaya
.
``
Prince
,
you
must
walk
with
me
.
May
he
,
*NL*
mother
?
This
young
cavalier
,
who
wo
n't
have
me
?
You
said
you
would
_
never
_
*NL*
have
me
,
did
n't
you
,
prince
?
No
--
no
,
not
like
that
;
_
that
's
_
not
the
way
*NL*
to
give
your
arm
.
Do
n't
you
know
how
to
give
your
arm
to
a
lady
yet
?
*NL*
There
--
so
.
Now
,
come
along
,
you
and
I
will
lead
the
way
.
Would
you
like
*NL*
to
lead
the
way
with
me
alone
,
tete-a-tete
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
on
talking
and
chatting
without
a
pause
,
with
occasional
little
*NL*
bursts
of
laughter
between
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
God
--
thank
God
!
''
said
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
to
herself
,
without
*NL*
quite
knowing
why
she
felt
so
relieved
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
extraordinary
people
they
are
!
''
thought
Prince
S.
,
for
perhaps
*NL*
the
hundredth
time
since
he
had
entered
into
intimate
relations
with
the
*NL*
family
;
but
--
he
liked
these
``
extraordinary
people
,
''
all
the
same
.
As
for
*NL*
Prince
Lef
Nicolaievitch
himself
,
Prince
S.
did
not
seem
quite
to
like
*NL*
him
,
somehow
.
He
was
decidedly
preoccupied
and
a
little
disturbed
as
*NL*
they
all
started
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
seemed
to
be
in
a
lively
humour
.
He
made
Adelaida
and
*NL*
Alexandra
laugh
all
the
way
to
the
Vauxhall
;
but
they
both
laughed
*NL*
so
very
really
and
promptly
that
the
worthy
Evgenie
began
at
last
to
*NL*
suspect
that
they
were
not
listening
to
him
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
idea
,
he
burst
out
laughing
all
at
once
,
in
quite
unaffected
*NL*
mirth
,
and
without
giving
any
explanation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sisters
,
who
also
appeared
to
be
in
high
spirits
,
never
tired
of
*NL*
glancing
at
Aglaya
and
the
prince
,
who
were
walking
in
front
.
It
was
*NL*
evident
that
their
younger
sister
was
a
thorough
puzzle
to
them
both
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
S.
tried
hard
to
get
up
a
conversation
with
Mrs.
Epanchin
upon
*NL*
outside
subjects
,
probably
with
the
good
intention
of
distracting
and
*NL*
amusing
her
;
but
he
bored
her
dreadfully
.
She
was
absent-minded
to
a
*NL*
degree
,
and
answered
at
cross
purposes
,
and
sometimes
not
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
puzzle
and
mystery
of
Aglaya
was
not
yet
over
for
the
evening
.
*NL*
The
last
exhibition
fell
to
the
lot
of
the
prince
alone
.
When
they
had
*NL*
proceeded
some
hundred
paces
or
so
from
the
house
,
Aglaya
said
to
her
*NL*
obstinately
silent
cavalier
in
a
quick
half-whisper
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
to
the
right
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
glanced
in
the
direction
indicated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
closer
.
Do
you
see
that
bench
,
in
the
park
there
,
just
by
those
*NL*
three
big
trees
--
that
green
bench
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
replied
that
he
saw
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
like
the
position
of
it
?
Sometimes
of
a
morning
early
,
at
seven
*NL*
o'clock
,
when
all
the
rest
are
still
asleep
,
I
come
out
and
sit
there
*NL*
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
muttered
that
the
spot
was
a
lovely
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
go
away
,
I
do
n't
wish
to
have
your
arm
any
longer
;
or
perhaps
,
*NL*
better
,
continue
to
give
me
your
arm
,
and
walk
along
beside
me
,
but
*NL*
do
n't
speak
a
word
to
me
.
I
wish
to
think
by
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
warning
was
certainly
unnecessary
;
for
the
prince
would
not
have
*NL*
said
a
word
all
the
rest
of
the
time
whether
forbidden
to
speak
or
not
.
*NL*
His
heart
beat
loud
and
painfully
when
Aglaya
spoke
of
the
bench
;
could
*NL*
she
--
but
no
!
he
banished
the
thought
,
after
an
instant
's
deliberation
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
Pavlofsk
,
on
weekdays
,
the
public
is
more
select
than
it
is
on
*NL*
Sundays
and
Saturdays
,
when
the
townsfolk
come
down
to
walk
about
and
*NL*
enjoy
the
park
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ladies
dress
elegantly
,
on
these
days
,
and
it
is
the
fashion
to
*NL*
gather
round
the
band
,
which
is
probably
the
best
of
our
pleasure-garden
*NL*
bands
,
and
plays
the
newest
pieces
.
The
behaviour
of
the
public
is
most
*NL*
correct
and
proper
,
and
there
is
an
appearance
of
friendly
intimacy
*NL*
among
the
usual
frequenters
.
Many
come
for
nothing
but
to
look
at
their
*NL*
acquaintances
,
but
there
are
others
who
come
for
the
sake
of
the
music
.
*NL*
It
is
very
seldom
that
anything
happens
to
break
the
harmony
of
the
*NL*
proceedings
,
though
,
of
course
,
accidents
will
happen
everywhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
this
particular
evening
the
weather
was
lovely
,
and
there
were
*NL*
a
large
number
of
people
present
.
All
the
places
anywhere
near
the
*NL*
orchestra
were
occupied
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
friends
took
chairs
near
the
side
exit
.
The
crowd
and
the
music
*NL*
cheered
Mrs.
Epanchin
a
little
,
and
amused
the
girls
;
they
bowed
and
*NL*
shook
hands
with
some
of
their
friends
and
nodded
at
a
distance
to
*NL*
others
;
they
examined
the
ladies
'
dresses
,
noticed
comicalities
*NL*
and
eccentricities
among
the
people
,
and
laughed
and
talked
among
*NL*
themselves
.
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
,
too
,
found
plenty
of
friends
to
bow
to
.
*NL*
Several
people
noticed
Aglaya
and
the
prince
,
who
were
still
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
very
long
two
or
three
young
men
had
come
up
,
and
one
or
two
*NL*
remained
to
talk
;
all
of
these
young
men
appeared
to
be
on
intimate
*NL*
terms
with
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
.
Among
them
was
a
young
officer
,
a
*NL*
remarkably
handsome
fellow
--
very
good-natured
and
a
great
chatterbox
.
He
*NL*
tried
to
get
up
a
conversation
with
Aglaya
,
and
did
his
best
to
secure
*NL*
her
attention
.
Aglaya
behaved
very
graciously
to
him
,
and
chatted
*NL*
and
laughed
merrily
.
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
begged
the
prince
's
leave
to
*NL*
introduce
their
friend
to
him
.
The
prince
hardly
realized
what
was
*NL*
wanted
of
him
,
but
the
introduction
came
off
;
the
two
men
bowed
and
*NL*
shook
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
's
friend
asked
the
prince
some
question
,
but
the
*NL*
latter
did
not
reply
,
or
if
he
did
,
he
muttered
something
so
strangely
*NL*
indistinct
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
made
of
it
.
The
officer
stared
*NL*
intently
at
him
,
then
glanced
at
Evgenie
,
divined
why
the
latter
had
*NL*
introduced
him
,
and
gave
his
undivided
attention
to
Aglaya
again
.
Only
*NL*
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
observed
that
Aglaya
flushed
up
for
a
moment
at
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
did
not
notice
that
others
were
talking
and
making
themselves
*NL*
agreeable
to
Aglaya
;
in
fact
,
at
moments
,
he
almost
forgot
that
he
was
*NL*
sitting
by
her
himself
.
At
other
moments
he
felt
a
longing
to
go
away
*NL*
somewhere
and
be
alone
with
his
thoughts
,
and
to
feel
that
no
one
knew
*NL*
where
he
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
Or
if
that
were
impossible
he
would
like
to
be
alone
at
home
,
on
the
*NL*
terrace-without
either
Lebedeff
or
his
children
,
or
anyone
else
about
*NL*
him
,
and
to
lie
there
and
think
--
a
day
and
night
and
another
day
again
!
*NL*
He
thought
of
the
mountains
--
and
especially
of
a
certain
spot
which
he
*NL*
used
to
frequent
,
whence
he
would
look
down
upon
the
distant
valleys
and
*NL*
fields
,
and
see
the
waterfall
,
far
off
,
like
a
little
silver
thread
,
*NL*
and
the
old
ruined
castle
in
the
distance
.
Oh
!
how
he
longed
to
be
there
*NL*
now
--
alone
with
his
thoughts
--
to
think
of
one
thing
all
his
life
--
one
*NL*
thing
!
A
thousand
years
would
not
be
too
much
time
!
And
let
everyone
*NL*
here
forget
him
--
forget
him
utterly
!
How
much
better
it
would
have
been
*NL*
if
they
had
never
known
him
--
if
all
this
could
but
prove
to
be
a
dream
.
*NL*
Perhaps
it
was
a
dream
!
*NL*
*NL*
Now
and
then
he
looked
at
Aglaya
for
five
minutes
at
a
time
,
without
*NL*
taking
his
eyes
off
her
face
;
but
his
expression
was
very
strange
;
*NL*
he
would
gaze
at
her
as
though
she
were
an
object
a
couple
of
miles
*NL*
distant
,
or
as
though
he
were
looking
at
her
portrait
and
not
at
herself
*NL*
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
look
at
me
like
that
,
prince
?
''
she
asked
suddenly
,
breaking
*NL*
off
her
merry
conversation
and
laughter
with
those
about
her
.
``
I
'm
*NL*
afraid
of
you
!
You
look
as
though
you
were
just
going
to
put
out
*NL*
your
hand
and
touch
my
face
to
see
if
it
's
real
!
Does
n't
he
,
Evgenie
*NL*
Pavlovitch
--
does
n't
he
look
like
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
seemed
surprised
that
he
should
have
been
addressed
at
all
;
*NL*
he
reflected
a
moment
,
but
did
not
seem
to
take
in
what
had
been
said
*NL*
to
him
;
at
all
events
,
he
did
not
answer
.
But
observing
that
she
and
*NL*
the
others
had
begun
to
laugh
,
he
too
opened
his
mouth
and
laughed
with
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
laughter
became
general
,
and
the
young
officer
,
who
seemed
a
*NL*
particularly
lively
sort
of
person
,
simply
shook
with
mirth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aglaya
suddenly
whispered
angrily
to
herself
the
word
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Idiot
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
goodness
--
surely
she
is
not
in
love
with
such
a
--
surely
she
is
n't
*NL*
mad
!
''
groaned
Mrs.
Epanchin
,
under
her
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
a
joke
,
mamma
;
it
's
just
a
joke
like
the
`
poor
*NL*
knight
'
--
nothing
more
whatever
,
I
assure
you
!
''
Alexandra
whispered
*NL*
in
her
ear
.
``
She
is
chaffing
him
--
making
a
fool
of
him
,
after
her
*NL*
own
private
fashion
,
that
's
all
!
But
she
carries
it
just
a
little
*NL*
too
far
--
she
is
a
regular
little
actress
.
How
she
frightened
us
just
*NL*
now
--
did
n't
she
?
--
and
all
for
a
lark
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
's
lucky
she
has
happened
upon
an
idiot
,
then
,
that
's
all
I
*NL*
can
say
!
''
whispered
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
,
who
was
somewhat
comforted
,
*NL*
however
,
by
her
daughter
's
remark
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
had
heard
himself
referred
to
as
``
idiot
,
''
and
had
shuddered
*NL*
at
the
moment
;
but
his
shudder
,
it
so
happened
,
was
not
caused
by
the
*NL*
word
applied
to
him
.
The
fact
was
that
in
the
crowd
,
not
far
from
where
*NL*
he
was
sitting
,
a
pale
familiar
face
,
with
curly
black
hair
,
and
a
*NL*
well-known
smile
and
expression
,
had
flashed
across
his
vision
for
a
*NL*
moment
,
and
disappeared
again
.
Very
likely
he
had
imagined
it
!
There
*NL*
only
remained
to
him
the
impression
of
a
strange
smile
,
two
eyes
,
and
*NL*
a
bright
green
tie
.
Whether
the
man
had
disappeared
among
the
crowd
,
or
*NL*
whether
he
had
turned
towards
the
Vauxhall
,
the
prince
could
not
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
a
moment
or
two
afterwards
he
began
to
glance
keenly
about
him
.
That
*NL*
first
vision
might
only
too
likely
be
the
forerunner
of
a
second
;
it
was
*NL*
almost
certain
to
be
so
.
Surely
he
had
not
forgotten
the
possibility
*NL*
of
such
a
meeting
when
he
came
to
the
Vauxhall
?
True
enough
,
he
had
not
*NL*
remarked
where
he
was
coming
to
when
he
set
out
with
Aglaya
;
he
had
not
*NL*
been
in
a
condition
to
remark
anything
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
he
been
more
careful
to
observe
his
companion
,
he
would
have
seen
*NL*
that
for
the
last
quarter
of
an
hour
Aglaya
had
also
been
glancing
*NL*
around
in
apparent
anxiety
,
as
though
she
expected
to
see
someone
,
or
*NL*
something
particular
,
among
the
crowd
of
people
.
Now
,
at
the
moment
when
*NL*
his
own
anxiety
became
so
marked
,
her
excitement
also
increased
visibly
,
*NL*
and
when
he
looked
about
him
,
she
did
the
same
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reason
for
their
anxiety
soon
became
apparent
.
From
that
very
side
*NL*
entrance
to
the
Vauxhall
,
near
which
the
prince
and
all
the
Epanchin
*NL*
party
were
seated
,
there
suddenly
appeared
quite
a
large
knot
of
*NL*
persons
,
at
least
a
dozen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Heading
this
little
band
walked
three
ladies
,
two
of
whom
were
*NL*
remarkably
lovely
;
and
there
was
nothing
surprising
in
the
fact
that
*NL*
they
should
have
had
a
large
troop
of
admirers
following
in
their
wake
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
was
something
in
the
appearance
of
both
the
ladies
and
their
*NL*
admirers
which
was
peculiar
,
quite
different
for
that
of
the
rest
of
the
*NL*
public
assembled
around
the
orchestra
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nearly
everyone
observed
the
little
band
advancing
,
and
all
pretended
*NL*
not
to
see
or
notice
them
,
except
a
few
young
fellows
who
exchanged
*NL*
glances
and
smiled
,
saying
something
to
one
another
in
whispers
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
impossible
to
avoid
noticing
them
,
however
,
in
reality
,
for
they
*NL*
made
their
presence
only
too
conspicuous
by
laughing
and
talking
loudly
.
*NL*
It
was
to
be
supposed
that
some
of
them
were
more
than
half
drunk
,
*NL*
although
they
were
well
enough
dressed
,
some
even
particularly
well
.
*NL*
There
were
one
or
two
,
however
,
who
were
very
strange-looking
creatures
,
*NL*
with
flushed
faces
and
extraordinary
clothes
;
some
were
military
men
;
*NL*
not
all
were
quite
young
;
one
or
two
were
middle-aged
gentlemen
of
*NL*
decidedly
disagreeable
appearance
,
men
who
are
avoided
in
society
like
*NL*
the
plague
,
decked
out
in
large
gold
studs
and
rings
,
and
magnificently
*NL*
``
got
up
,
''
generally
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
our
suburban
resorts
there
are
some
which
enjoy
a
specially
*NL*
high
reputation
for
respectability
and
fashion
;
but
the
most
careful
*NL*
individual
is
not
absolutely
exempt
from
the
danger
of
a
tile
falling
*NL*
suddenly
upon
his
head
from
his
neighbour
's
roof
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
a
tile
was
about
to
descend
upon
the
elegant
and
decorous
public
*NL*
now
assembled
to
hear
the
music
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
order
to
pass
from
the
Vauxhall
to
the
band-stand
,
the
visitor
has
*NL*
to
descend
two
or
three
steps
.
Just
at
these
steps
the
group
paused
,
as
*NL*
though
it
feared
to
proceed
further
;
but
very
quickly
one
of
the
three
*NL*
ladies
,
who
formed
its
apex
,
stepped
forward
into
the
charmed
circle
,
*NL*
followed
by
two
members
of
her
suite
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
these
was
a
middle-aged
man
of
very
respectable
appearance
,
but
*NL*
with
the
stamp
of
parvenu
upon
him
,
a
man
whom
nobody
knew
,
and
who
*NL*
evidently
knew
nobody
.
The
other
follower
was
younger
and
far
less
*NL*
respectable-looking
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
else
followed
the
eccentric
lady
;
but
as
she
descended
the
steps
*NL*
she
did
not
even
look
behind
her
,
as
though
it
were
absolutely
the
same
*NL*
to
her
whether
anyone
were
following
or
not
.
She
laughed
and
talked
*NL*
loudly
,
however
,
just
as
before
.
She
was
dressed
with
great
taste
,
but
*NL*
with
rather
more
magnificence
than
was
needed
for
the
occasion
,
perhaps
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
walked
past
the
orchestra
,
to
where
an
open
carriage
was
waiting
,
*NL*
near
the
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
had
not
seen
_
her
_
for
more
than
three
months
.
All
these
days
*NL*
since
his
arrival
from
Petersburg
he
had
intended
to
pay
her
a
visit
,
*NL*
but
some
mysterious
presentiment
had
restrained
him
.
He
could
not
*NL*
picture
to
himself
what
impression
this
meeting
with
her
would
make
upon
*NL*
him
,
though
he
had
often
tried
to
imagine
it
,
with
fear
and
trembling
.
*NL*
One
fact
was
quite
certain
,
and
that
was
that
the
meeting
would
be
*NL*
painful
.
*NL*
*NL*
Several
times
during
the
last
six
months
he
had
recalled
the
effect
*NL*
which
the
first
sight
of
this
face
had
had
upon
him
,
when
he
only
saw
*NL*
its
portrait
.
He
recollected
well
that
even
the
portrait
face
had
left
*NL*
but
too
painful
an
impression
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
month
in
the
provinces
,
when
he
had
seen
this
woman
nearly
every
*NL*
day
,
had
affected
him
so
deeply
that
he
could
not
now
look
back
upon
*NL*
it
calmly
.
In
the
very
look
of
this
woman
there
was
something
which
*NL*
tortured
him
.
In
conversation
with
Rogojin
he
had
attributed
this
*NL*
sensation
to
pity
--
immeasurable
pity
,
and
this
was
the
truth
.
The
sight
*NL*
of
the
portrait
face
alone
had
filled
his
heart
full
of
the
agony
of
*NL*
real
sympathy
;
and
this
feeling
of
sympathy
,
nay
,
of
actual
_
suffering
_
,
*NL*
for
her
,
had
never
left
his
heart
since
that
hour
,
and
was
still
in
full
*NL*
force
.
Oh
yes
,
and
more
powerful
than
ever
!
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
prince
was
not
satisfied
with
what
he
had
said
to
Rogojin
.
Only
*NL*
at
this
moment
,
when
she
suddenly
made
her
appearance
before
him
,
did
*NL*
he
realize
to
the
full
the
exact
emotion
which
she
called
up
in
him
,
and
*NL*
which
he
had
not
described
correctly
to
Rogojin
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
indeed
,
there
were
no
words
in
which
he
could
have
expressed
his
*NL*
horror
,
yes
,
_
horror
_
,
for
he
was
now
fully
convinced
from
his
own
private
*NL*
knowledge
of
her
,
that
the
woman
was
mad
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
,
loving
a
woman
above
everything
in
the
world
,
or
at
least
having
a
*NL*
foretaste
of
the
possibility
of
such
love
for
her
,
one
were
suddenly
to
*NL*
behold
her
on
a
chain
,
behind
bars
and
under
the
lash
of
a
keeper
,
one
*NL*
would
feel
something
like
what
the
poor
prince
now
felt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
?
''
asked
Aglaya
,
in
a
whisper
,
giving
his
sleeve
a
*NL*
little
tug
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
his
head
towards
her
and
glanced
at
her
black
and
-LRB-
for
some
*NL*
reason
-RRB-
flashing
eyes
,
tried
to
smile
,
and
then
,
apparently
forgetting
*NL*
her
in
an
instant
,
turned
to
the
right
once
more
,
and
continued
to
watch
*NL*
the
startling
apparition
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nastasia
Philipovna
was
at
this
moment
passing
the
young
ladies
'
chairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
continued
some
apparently
extremely
funny
and
*NL*
interesting
anecdote
to
Alexandra
,
speaking
quickly
and
with
much
*NL*
animation
.
The
prince
remembered
that
at
this
moment
Aglaya
remarked
in
*NL*
a
half-whisper
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
What
_
a
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
finish
her
indefinite
sentence
;
she
restrained
herself
in
a
*NL*
moment
;
but
it
was
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nastasia
Philipovna
,
who
up
to
now
had
been
walking
along
as
though
she
*NL*
had
not
noticed
the
Epanchin
party
,
suddenly
turned
her
head
in
their
*NL*
direction
,
as
though
she
had
just
observed
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
sitting
*NL*
there
for
the
first
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
declare
,
here
he
is
!
''
she
cried
,
stopping
suddenly
.
``
The
man
one
*NL*
ca
n't
find
with
all
one
's
messengers
sent
about
the
place
,
sitting
just
*NL*
under
one
's
nose
,
exactly
where
one
never
thought
of
looking
!
I
thought
*NL*
you
were
sure
to
be
at
your
uncle
's
by
this
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
flushed
up
and
looked
angrily
at
Nastasia
Philipovna
,
*NL*
then
turned
his
back
on
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
do
n't
you
know
about
it
yet
?
He
does
n't
know
--
imagine
that
!
Why
,
*NL*
he
's
shot
himself
.
Your
uncle
shot
himself
this
very
morning
.
I
was
told
*NL*
at
two
this
afternoon
.
Half
the
town
must
know
it
by
now
.
They
say
there
*NL*
are
three
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
roubles
,
government
money
,
missing
;
*NL*
some
say
five
hundred
thousand
.
And
I
was
under
the
impression
that
he
*NL*
would
leave
you
a
fortune
!
He
's
whistled
it
all
away
.
A
most
depraved
*NL*
old
gentleman
,
really
!
Well
,
ta
,
ta
!
--
bonne
chance
!
Surely
you
intend
*NL*
to
be
off
there
,
do
n't
you
?
Ha
,
ha
!
You
've
retired
from
the
army
in
good
*NL*
time
,
I
see
!
Plain
clothes
!
Well
done
,
sly
rogue
!
Nonsense
!
I
see
--
you
*NL*
knew
it
all
before
--
I
dare
say
you
knew
all
about
it
yesterday
-
''
*NL*
*NL*
Although
the
impudence
of
this
attack
,
this
public
proclamation
of
*NL*
intimacy
,
as
it
were
,
was
doubtless
premeditated
,
and
had
its
special
*NL*
object
,
yet
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
at
first
seemed
to
intend
to
make
no
*NL*
show
of
observing
either
his
tormentor
or
her
words
.
But
Nastasia
's
*NL*
communication
struck
him
with
the
force
of
a
thunderclap
.
On
hearing
*NL*
of
his
uncle
's
death
he
suddenly
grew
as
white
as
a
sheet
,
and
turned
*NL*
towards
his
informant
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
,
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
rose
swiftly
from
her
seat
,
*NL*
beckoned
her
companions
,
and
left
the
place
almost
at
a
run
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
the
prince
stopped
behind
for
a
moment
,
as
though
in
indecision
;
*NL*
and
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
lingered
too
,
for
he
had
not
collected
his
*NL*
scattered
wits
.
But
the
Epanchins
had
not
had
time
to
get
more
than
*NL*
twenty
paces
away
when
a
scandalous
episode
occurred
.
The
young
officer
,
*NL*
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
's
friend
who
had
been
conversing
with
Aglaya
,
said
*NL*
aloud
in
a
great
state
of
indignation
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
ought
to
be
whipped
--
that
's
the
only
way
to
deal
with
creatures
*NL*
like
that
--
she
ought
to
be
whipped
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
gentleman
was
a
confidant
of
Evgenie
's
,
and
had
doubtless
heard
of
*NL*
the
carriage
episode
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nastasia
turned
to
him
.
Her
eyes
flashed
;
she
rushed
up
to
a
young
man
*NL*
standing
near
,
whom
she
did
not
know
in
the
least
,
but
who
happened
to
*NL*
have
in
his
hand
a
thin
cane
.
Seizing
this
from
him
,
she
brought
it
with
*NL*
all
her
force
across
the
face
of
her
insulter
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
occurred
,
of
course
,
in
one
instant
of
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
officer
,
forgetting
himself
,
sprang
towards
her
.
Nastasia
's
*NL*
followers
were
not
by
her
at
the
moment
-LRB-
the
elderly
gentleman
having
*NL*
disappeared
altogether
,
and
the
younger
man
simply
standing
aside
and
*NL*
roaring
with
laughter
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
another
moment
,
of
course
,
the
police
would
have
been
on
the
spot
,
*NL*
and
it
would
have
gone
hard
with
Nastasia
Philipovna
had
not
unexpected
*NL*
aid
appeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
Muishkin
,
who
was
but
a
couple
of
steps
away
,
had
time
to
spring
forward
*NL*
and
seize
the
officer
's
arms
from
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
officer
,
tearing
himself
from
the
prince
's
grasp
,
pushed
him
so
*NL*
violently
backwards
that
he
staggered
a
few
steps
and
then
subsided
into
*NL*
a
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
were
other
defenders
for
Nastasia
on
the
spot
by
this
time
.
*NL*
The
gentleman
known
as
the
``
boxer
''
now
confronted
the
enraged
officer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Keller
is
my
name
,
sir
;
ex-lieutenant
,
''
he
said
,
very
loud
.
``
If
you
*NL*
will
accept
me
as
champion
of
the
fair
sex
,
I
am
at
your
disposal
.
*NL*
English
boxing
has
no
secrets
from
me
.
I
sympathize
with
you
for
the
*NL*
insult
you
have
received
,
but
I
ca
n't
permit
you
to
raise
your
hand
*NL*
against
a
woman
in
public
.
If
you
prefer
to
meet
me
--
as
would
be
more
*NL*
fitting
to
your
rank
--
in
some
other
manner
,
of
course
you
understand
me
,
*NL*
captain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
young
officer
had
recovered
himself
,
and
was
no
longer
*NL*
listening
.
At
this
moment
Rogojin
appeared
,
elbowing
through
the
crowd
;
*NL*
he
took
Nastasia
's
hand
,
drew
it
through
his
arm
,
and
quickly
led
her
*NL*
away
.
He
appeared
to
be
terribly
excited
;
he
was
trembling
all
over
,
*NL*
and
was
as
pale
as
a
corpse
.
As
he
carried
Nastasia
off
,
he
turned
and
*NL*
grinned
horribly
in
the
officer
's
face
,
and
with
low
malice
observed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tfu
!
look
what
the
fellow
got
!
Look
at
the
blood
on
his
cheek
!
Ha
,
ha
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Recollecting
himself
,
however
,
and
seeing
at
a
glance
the
sort
of
people
*NL*
he
had
to
deal
with
,
the
officer
turned
his
back
on
both
his
opponents
,
*NL*
and
courteously
,
but
concealing
his
face
with
his
handkerchief
,
*NL*
approached
the
prince
,
who
was
now
rising
from
the
chair
into
which
he
*NL*
had
fallen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Prince
Muishkin
,
I
believe
?
The
gentleman
to
whom
I
had
the
honour
of
*NL*
being
introduced
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
mad
,
insane
--
I
assure
you
,
she
is
mad
,
''
replied
the
prince
in
*NL*
trembling
tones
,
holding
out
both
his
hands
mechanically
towards
the
*NL*
officer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
boast
of
any
such
knowledge
,
of
course
,
but
I
wished
to
know
*NL*
your
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
bowed
and
retired
without
waiting
for
an
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Five
seconds
after
the
disappearance
of
the
last
actor
in
this
scene
,
*NL*
the
police
arrived
.
The
whole
episode
had
not
lasted
more
than
a
couple
*NL*
of
minutes
.
Some
of
the
spectators
had
risen
from
their
places
,
and
*NL*
departed
altogether
;
some
merely
exchanged
their
seats
for
others
a
*NL*
little
further
off
;
some
were
delighted
with
the
occurrence
,
and
talked
*NL*
and
laughed
over
it
for
a
long
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
word
,
the
incident
closed
as
such
incidents
do
,
and
the
band
began
*NL*
to
play
again
.
The
prince
walked
away
after
the
Epanchin
party
.
Had
*NL*
he
thought
of
looking
round
to
the
left
after
he
had
been
pushed
so
*NL*
unceremoniously
into
the
chair
,
he
would
have
observed
Aglaya
standing
*NL*
some
twenty
yards
away
.
She
had
stayed
to
watch
the
scandalous
scene
in
*NL*
spite
of
her
mother
's
and
sisters
'
anxious
cries
to
her
to
come
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
S.
ran
up
to
her
and
persuaded
her
,
at
last
,
to
come
home
with
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
saw
that
she
returned
in
such
a
state
of
agitation
*NL*
that
it
was
doubtful
whether
she
had
even
heard
their
calls
.
But
only
a
*NL*
couple
of
minutes
later
,
when
they
had
reached
the
park
,
Aglaya
suddenly
*NL*
remarked
,
in
her
usual
calm
,
indifferent
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wanted
to
see
how
the
farce
would
end
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
III
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
occurrence
at
the
Vauxhall
had
filled
both
mother
and
daughters
with
*NL*
something
like
horror
.
In
their
excitement
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
and
the
*NL*
girls
were
nearly
running
all
the
way
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
her
opinion
there
was
so
much
disclosed
and
laid
bare
by
the
episode
,
*NL*
that
,
in
spite
of
the
chaotic
condition
of
her
mind
,
she
was
able
to
*NL*
feel
more
or
less
decided
on
certain
points
which
,
up
to
now
,
had
been
*NL*
in
a
cloudy
condition
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
one
and
all
of
the
party
realized
that
something
important
*NL*
had
happened
,
and
that
,
perhaps
fortunately
enough
,
something
which
had
*NL*
hitherto
been
enveloped
in
the
obscurity
of
guess-work
had
now
begun
to
*NL*
come
forth
a
little
from
the
mists
.
In
spite
of
Prince
S.
's
assurances
*NL*
and
explanations
,
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
's
real
character
and
position
were
*NL*
at
last
coming
to
light
.
He
was
publicly
convicted
of
intimacy
with
*NL*
``
that
creature
.
''
So
thought
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
and
her
two
elder
*NL*
daughters
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
real
upshot
of
the
business
was
that
the
number
of
riddles
to
*NL*
be
solved
was
augmented
.
The
two
girls
,
though
rather
irritated
at
their
*NL*
mother
's
exaggerated
alarm
and
haste
to
depart
from
the
scene
,
had
been
*NL*
unwilling
to
worry
her
at
first
with
questions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
,
they
could
not
help
thinking
that
their
sister
Aglaya
probably
*NL*
knew
more
about
the
whole
matter
than
both
they
and
their
mother
put
*NL*
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
S.
looked
as
black
as
night
,
and
was
silent
and
moody
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Epanchin
did
not
say
a
word
to
him
all
the
way
home
,
and
he
did
not
seem
*NL*
to
observe
the
fact
.
Adelaida
tried
to
pump
him
a
little
by
asking
,
``
who
*NL*
was
the
uncle
they
were
talking
about
,
and
what
was
it
that
had
happened
*NL*
in
Petersburg
?
''
But
he
had
merely
muttered
something
disconnected
about
*NL*
``
making
inquiries
,
''
and
that
``
of
course
it
was
all
nonsense
.
''
``
Oh
,
of
*NL*
course
,
''
replied
Adelaida
,
and
asked
no
more
questions
.
Aglaya
,
too
,
was
*NL*
very
quiet
;
and
the
only
remark
she
made
on
the
way
home
was
that
they
*NL*
were
``
walking
much
too
fast
to
be
pleasant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Once
she
turned
and
observed
the
prince
hurrying
after
them
.
Noticing
*NL*
his
anxiety
to
catch
them
up
,
she
smiled
ironically
,
and
then
looked
*NL*
back
no
more
.
At
length
,
just
as
they
neared
the
house
,
General
Epanchin
*NL*
came
out
and
met
them
;
he
had
only
just
arrived
from
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
first
word
was
to
inquire
after
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
.
But
Lizabetha
*NL*
stalked
past
him
,
and
neither
looked
at
him
nor
answered
his
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
immediately
judged
from
the
faces
of
his
daughters
and
Prince
S.
that
*NL*
there
was
a
thunderstorm
brewing
,
and
he
himself
already
bore
evidences
*NL*
of
unusual
perturbation
of
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
immediately
button-holed
Prince
S.
,
and
standing
at
the
front
door
,
*NL*
engaged
in
a
whispered
conversation
with
him
.
By
the
troubled
aspect
of
*NL*
both
of
them
,
when
they
entered
the
house
,
and
approached
Mrs.
Epanchin
,
*NL*
it
was
evident
that
they
had
been
discussing
very
disturbing
news
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
by
little
the
family
gathered
together
upstairs
in
Lizabetha
*NL*
Prokofievna
's
apartments
,
and
Prince
Muishkin
found
himself
alone
on
*NL*
the
verandah
when
he
arrived
.
He
settled
himself
in
a
corner
and
sat
*NL*
waiting
,
though
he
knew
not
what
he
expected
.
It
never
struck
him
that
*NL*
he
had
better
go
away
,
with
all
this
disturbance
in
the
house
.
He
seemed
*NL*
to
have
forgotten
all
the
world
,
and
to
be
ready
to
sit
on
where
he
was
*NL*
for
years
on
end
.
From
upstairs
he
caught
sounds
of
excited
conversation
*NL*
every
now
and
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
say
how
long
he
sat
there
.
It
grew
late
and
became
quite
*NL*
dark
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
Aglaya
entered
the
verandah
.
She
seemed
to
be
quite
calm
,
*NL*
though
a
little
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
Observing
the
prince
,
whom
she
evidently
did
not
expect
to
see
there
,
*NL*
alone
in
the
corner
,
she
smiled
,
and
approached
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
doing
there
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
muttered
something
,
blushed
,
and
jumped
up
;
but
Aglaya
*NL*
immediately
sat
down
beside
him
;
so
he
reseated
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
suddenly
,
but
attentively
into
his
face
,
then
at
the
window
,
*NL*
as
though
thinking
of
something
else
,
and
then
again
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
she
wants
to
laugh
at
me
,
''
thought
the
prince
,
``
but
no
;
for
if
*NL*
she
did
she
certainly
would
do
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
like
some
tea
?
I
'll
order
some
,
''
she
said
,
after
a
minute
or
*NL*
two
of
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
N-no
thanks
,
I
do
n't
know
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
know
!
How
can
you
not
know
?
By-the-by
,
look
here
--
if
someone
*NL*
were
to
challenge
you
to
a
duel
,
what
should
you
do
?
I
wished
to
ask
you
*NL*
this
--
some
time
ago
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
Nobody
would
ever
challenge
me
to
a
duel
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
they
were
to
,
would
you
be
dreadfully
frightened
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dare
say
I
should
be
--
much
alarmed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Seriously
?
Then
are
you
a
coward
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
N-no
!
--
I
do
n't
think
so
.
A
coward
is
a
man
who
is
afraid
and
runs
away
;
*NL*
the
man
who
is
frightened
but
does
not
run
away
,
is
not
quite
a
coward
,
''
*NL*
said
the
prince
with
a
smile
,
after
a
moment
's
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
would
n't
run
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
I
do
n't
think
I
should
run
away
,
''
replied
the
prince
,
laughing
*NL*
outright
at
last
at
Aglaya
's
questions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Though
I
am
a
woman
,
I
should
certainly
not
run
away
for
anything
,
''
*NL*
said
Aglaya
,
in
a
slightly
pained
voice
.
``
However
,
I
see
you
are
*NL*
laughing
at
me
and
twisting
your
face
up
as
usual
in
order
to
make
*NL*
yourself
look
more
interesting
.
Now
tell
me
,
they
generally
shoot
at
*NL*
twenty
paces
,
do
n't
they
?
At
ten
,
sometimes
?
I
suppose
if
at
ten
they
*NL*
must
be
either
wounded
or
killed
,
must
n't
they
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
they
often
kill
each
other
at
duels
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
killed
Pushkin
that
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
may
have
been
an
accident
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
bit
of
it
;
it
was
a
duel
to
the
death
,
and
he
was
killed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
bullet
struck
so
low
down
that
probably
his
antagonist
would
never
*NL*
have
aimed
at
that
part
of
him
--
people
never
do
;
he
would
have
aimed
at
*NL*
his
chest
or
head
;
so
that
probably
the
bullet
hit
him
accidentally
.
I
*NL*
have
been
told
this
by
competent
authorities
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
a
soldier
once
told
me
that
they
were
always
ordered
to
aim
at
*NL*
the
middle
of
the
body
.
So
you
see
they
do
n't
aim
at
the
chest
or
head
;
*NL*
they
aim
lower
on
purpose
.
I
asked
some
officer
about
this
afterwards
,
*NL*
and
he
said
it
was
perfectly
true
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
probably
when
they
fire
from
a
long
distance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
shoot
at
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
have
never
shot
in
my
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ca
n't
you
even
load
a
pistol
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
That
is
,
I
understand
how
it
's
done
,
of
course
,
but
I
have
never
*NL*
done
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
you
do
n't
know
how
,
for
it
is
a
matter
that
needs
practice
.
Now
*NL*
listen
and
learn
;
in
the
first
place
buy
good
powder
,
not
damp
-LRB-
they
say
*NL*
it
must
n't
be
at
all
damp
,
but
very
dry
-RRB-
,
some
fine
kind
it
is
--
you
must
*NL*
ask
for
_
pistol
_
powder
,
not
the
stuff
they
load
cannons
with
.
They
say
*NL*
one
makes
the
bullets
oneself
,
somehow
or
other
.
Have
you
got
a
pistol
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
and
I
do
n't
want
one
,
''
said
the
prince
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
what
_
nonsense
!
_
You
must
buy
one
.
French
or
English
are
the
best
,
*NL*
they
say
.
Then
take
a
little
powder
,
about
a
thimbleful
,
or
perhaps
two
,
*NL*
and
pour
it
into
the
barrel
.
Better
put
plenty
.
Then
push
in
a
bit
of
*NL*
felt
-LRB-
it
_
must
_
be
felt
,
for
some
reason
or
other
-RRB-
;
you
can
easily
get
*NL*
a
bit
off
some
old
mattress
,
or
off
a
door
;
it
's
used
to
keep
the
cold
*NL*
out
.
Well
,
when
you
have
pushed
the
felt
down
,
put
the
bullet
in
;
do
you
*NL*
hear
now
?
The
bullet
last
and
the
powder
first
,
not
the
other
way
,
or
*NL*
the
pistol
wo
n't
shoot
.
What
are
you
laughing
at
?
I
wish
you
to
buy
*NL*
a
pistol
and
practise
every
day
,
and
you
must
learn
to
hit
a
mark
for
*NL*
_
certain
_
;
will
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
only
laughed
.
Aglaya
stamped
her
foot
with
annoyance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
serious
air
,
however
,
during
this
conversation
had
surprised
him
*NL*
considerably
.
He
had
a
feeling
that
he
ought
to
be
asking
her
something
,
*NL*
that
there
was
something
he
wanted
to
find
out
far
more
important
than
*NL*
how
to
load
a
pistol
;
but
his
thoughts
had
all
scattered
,
and
he
was
*NL*
only
aware
that
she
was
sitting
by
him
,
and
talking
to
him
,
and
that
*NL*
he
was
looking
at
her
;
as
to
what
she
happened
to
be
saying
to
him
,
that
*NL*
did
not
matter
in
the
least
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
general
now
appeared
on
the
verandah
,
coming
from
upstairs
.
He
was
*NL*
on
his
way
out
,
with
an
expression
of
determination
on
his
face
,
and
of
*NL*
preoccupation
and
worry
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
Lef
Nicolaievitch
,
it
's
you
,
is
it
?
Where
are
you
off
to
now
?
''
he
*NL*
asked
,
oblivious
of
the
fact
that
the
prince
had
not
showed
the
least
*NL*
sign
of
moving
.
``
Come
along
with
me
;
I
want
to
say
a
word
or
two
to
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Au
revoir
_
,
then
!
''
said
Aglaya
,
holding
out
her
hand
to
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
quite
dark
now
,
and
Muishkin
could
not
see
her
face
clearly
,
but
*NL*
a
minute
or
two
later
,
when
he
and
the
general
had
left
the
villa
,
he
*NL*
suddenly
flushed
up
,
and
squeezed
his
right
hand
tightly
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
appeared
that
he
and
the
general
were
going
in
the
same
direction
.
In
*NL*
spite
of
the
lateness
of
the
hour
,
the
general
was
hurrying
away
to
talk
*NL*
to
someone
upon
some
important
subject
.
Meanwhile
he
talked
incessantly
*NL*
but
disconnectedly
to
the
prince
,
and
continually
brought
in
the
name
of
*NL*
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
prince
had
been
in
a
condition
to
pay
more
attention
to
what
*NL*
the
general
was
saying
,
he
would
have
discovered
that
the
latter
was
*NL*
desirous
of
drawing
some
information
out
of
him
,
or
indeed
of
asking
him
*NL*
some
question
outright
;
but
that
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
come
*NL*
to
the
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
Muishkin
was
so
absent
,
that
from
the
very
first
he
could
not
attend
*NL*
to
a
word
the
other
was
saying
;
and
when
the
general
suddenly
stopped
*NL*
before
him
with
some
excited
question
,
he
was
obliged
to
confess
,
*NL*
ignominiously
,
that
he
did
not
know
in
the
least
what
he
had
been
*NL*
talking
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
general
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
strange
everyone
,
yourself
included
,
has
become
of
late
,
''
said
*NL*
he
.
``
I
was
telling
you
that
I
can
not
in
the
least
understand
Lizabetha
*NL*
Prokofievna
's
ideas
and
agitations
.
She
is
in
hysterics
up
there
,
and
*NL*
moans
and
says
that
we
have
been
`
shamed
and
disgraced
.
'
How
?
Why
?
When
?
*NL*
By
whom
?
I
confess
that
I
am
very
much
to
blame
myself
;
I
do
not
conceal
*NL*
the
fact
;
but
the
conduct
,
the
outrageous
behaviour
of
this
woman
,
must
*NL*
really
be
kept
within
limits
,
by
the
police
if
necessary
,
and
I
am
just
*NL*
on
my
way
now
to
talk
the
question
over
and
make
some
arrangements
.
*NL*
It
can
all
be
managed
quietly
and
gently
,
even
kindly
,
and
without
the
*NL*
slightest
fuss
or
scandal
.
I
foresee
that
the
future
is
pregnant
with
*NL*
events
,
and
that
there
is
much
that
needs
explanation
.
There
is
intrigue
*NL*
in
the
wind
;
but
if
on
one
side
nothing
is
known
,
on
the
other
side
*NL*
nothing
will
be
explained
.
If
I
have
heard
nothing
about
it
,
nor
have
*NL*
_
you
_
,
nor
_
he
_
,
nor
_
she
_
--
who
_
has
_
heard
about
it
,
I
should
like
to
*NL*
know
?
How
_
can
_
all
this
be
explained
except
by
the
fact
that
half
of
*NL*
it
is
mirage
or
moonshine
,
or
some
hallucination
of
that
sort
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
She
_
is
insane
,
''
muttered
the
prince
,
suddenly
recollecting
all
that
had
*NL*
passed
,
with
a
spasm
of
pain
at
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
too
had
that
idea
,
and
I
slept
in
peace
.
But
now
I
see
that
their
*NL*
opinion
is
more
correct
.
I
do
not
believe
in
the
theory
of
madness
!
The
*NL*
woman
has
no
common
sense
;
but
she
is
not
only
not
insane
,
she
is
artful
*NL*
to
a
degree
.
Her
outburst
of
this
evening
about
Evgenie
's
uncle
proves
*NL*
that
conclusively
.
It
was
_
villainous
_
,
simply
jesuitical
,
and
it
was
all
*NL*
for
some
special
purpose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
about
Evgenie
's
uncle
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
goodness
,
Lef
Nicolaievitch
,
why
,
you
ca
n't
have
heard
a
single

word
I
said
!
Look
at
me
,
I
'm
still
trembling
all
over
with
the
dreadful
*NL*
shock
!
It
is
that
that
kept
me
in
town
so
late
.
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
's
*NL*
uncle

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
cried
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shot
himself
this
morning
,
at
seven
o'clock
.
A
respected
,
eminent
old
*NL*
man
of
seventy
;
and
exactly
point
for
point
as
she
described
it
;
a
sum
*NL*
of
money
,
a
considerable
sum
of
government
money
,
missing
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

how
could
she
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What

know
of
it

Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
Why
,
there
was
a
whole
crowd
round
her
*NL*
the
moment
she
appeared
on
the
scenes
here
.
You
know
what
sort
of
people
*NL*
surround
her
nowadays
,
and
solicit
the
honour
of
her
`
acquaintance
.
'
*NL*
Of
course
she
might
easily
have
heard
the
news
from
someone
coming
from
*NL*
town
.
All
Petersburg
,
if
not
all
Pavlofsk
,
knows
it
by
now
.
Look
at
the
*NL*
slyness
of
her
observation
about
Evgenie
's
uniform
!
I
mean
,
her
remark
*NL*
that
he
had
retired
just
in
time
!
There
's
a
venomous
hint
for
you
,
*NL*
if
you
like
!
No
,
no
!
there
's
no
insanity
there
!
Of
course
I
refuse
*NL*
to
believe
that
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
could
have
known
beforehand
of
the
*NL*
catastrophe
;
that
is
,
that
at
such
and
such
a
day
at
seven
o'clock
,
and
*NL*
all
that
;
but
he
might
well
have
had
a
presentiment
of
the
truth
.
And
*NL*
I
--
all
of
us
--
Prince
S.
and
everybody
,
believed
that
he
was
to
inherit
*NL*
a
large
fortune
from
this
uncle
.
It
's
dreadful
,
horrible
!
Mind
,
I
do
n't
*NL*
suspect
Evgenie
of
anything
,
be
quite
clear
on
that
point
;
but
the
*NL*
thing
is
a
little
suspicious
,
nevertheless
.
Prince
S.
ca
n't
get
over
it
.
*NL*
Altogether
it
is
a
very
extraordinary
combination
of
circumstances

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
suspicion
attaches
to
Evgenie
Pavlovitch

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

none

Lizabetha

I

do

telling
you

continued
the

*NL*
more
agitated
than
ever
,
and
trembling
with
excitement
,
``

I
have
*NL*
been
letting
the
cat
out

reflect
that
it

be
treated
so

Aglaya
laughs
at
*NL*
her
mother
.
Her
sisters
guessed
about
Evgenie
having
proposed
and
been
*NL*
rejected
,
and
told
Lizabetha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
,
my
dear
fellow

Aglaya
is
such
an
extraordinary
,
such
a
*NL*
self-willed
,
fantastical
little
creature
,
you
would
n't
believe
it
!
Every
*NL*
high
quality
,
every
brilliant
trait
of
heart
and
mind
,
are
to
be
*NL*
found
in
her
,

,
with
it
all
,
so
much
caprice
and
mockery
,
such
wild
*NL*
fancies
--
indeed
,
a
little
devil
!
She
has
just
been
laughing
at
her
*NL*
mother
to
her
very
face
,
and
at
her
sisters
,
and
at
Prince
S.
,
and
*NL*
everybody

and
of
course
she
always
laughs
at
me

You
know
I
love
the
*NL*
child

I
love
her
even
when
she
laughs
at
me
,

I
believe
the
wild

little
creature
has
a
special
fondness

She

is
fonder

any
of

I
dare
swear
she
has
had
a
*NL*
good
laugh
at
_
you
_
before
now
!
You
were
having
a
quiet
talk
just
now
,
I
*NL*
observed
,
after
all
the
thunder
and
lightning
upstairs
.
She
was
sitting
*NL*
with
you
just
as
though
there
had
been
no
row
at
all

*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
blushed
painfully
in
the
darkness
,
and
closed
his
right
hand
*NL*
tightly
,
but
he
said
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
good
Prince
Lef
Nicolaievitch

began
the
general
again
,
*NL*
suddenly
,
``
both
I
and
Lizabetha
Prokofievna

-LRB-
who
has
begun
to
respect
*NL*
you
once
more
,
and
me
through
you
,
goodness
knows
why
!
-RRB-
--
we
both
love
*NL*
you
very
sincerely
,
and
esteem
you
,
in
spite
of
any
appearances
to
the
*NL*
contrary

But
you
'll
admit
what
a
riddle
it
must
have
been
for
us
when
*NL*
that
calm
,
cold
,
little
spitfire
,
Aglaya
--
-LRB-
for
she
stood
up
to
her
*NL*
mother
and
answered
her
questions
with
inexpressible
contempt
,
and
mine
*NL*
still
more
so
,
because
,
like
a
fool
,
I
thought
it
my
duty
to
assert
*NL*
myself
as
head
of
the
family
-RRB-
--
when
Aglaya
stood
up
of
a
sudden
and
*NL*
informed
us
that
`
that
madwoman

-LRB-
strangely
enough
,
she
used
exactly
the
*NL*
same
expression
as
you
did
-RRB-
`
has
taken
it
into
her
head
to
marry
me
*NL*
to
Prince
Lef
Nicolaievitch
,
and
therefore
is
doing
her
best
to
choke
*NL*
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
off
,
and
rid
the
house
of
him
.
'
That
's
what
she
said
.
*NL*
She
would
not
give
the
slightest
explanation
;
she
burst
out
laughing
,
*NL*
banged
the
door
,
and
went
away
.
We
all
stood
there
with
our
mouths
open
.
*NL*
Well
,
I
was
told
afterwards
of
your
little
passage
with
Aglaya
this
*NL*
afternoon
,
and
--
and
--
dear
prince
--
you
are
a
good
,
sensible
fellow
,
do
n't
*NL*
be
angry
if
I
speak
out
--
she
is
laughing
at
you
,
my
boy
!
She
is
enjoying
*NL*
herself
like
a
child
,
at
your
expense
,
and
therefore
,
since
she
is
a
*NL*
child
,
do
n't
be
angry
with
her
,
and
do
n't
think
anything
of
it
.
I
assure
*NL*
you
,
she
is
simply
making
a
fool
of
you
,
just
as
she
does
with
one
and
*NL*
all
of
us
out
of
pure
lack
of
something
better
to
do
.
Well
--
good-bye
!
*NL*
You
know
our
feelings
,
do
n't
you
--
our
sincere
feelings
for
yourself
?
*NL*
They
are
unalterable
,
you
know
,
dear
boy
,
under
all
circumstances
,
*NL*
but
--
Well
,
here
we
part
;
I
must
go
down
to
the
right
.
Rarely
have
I
sat
*NL*
so
uncomfortably
in
my
saddle
,
as
they
say
,
as
I
now
sit
.
And
people
*NL*
talk
of
the
charms
of
a
country
holiday
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Left
to
himself
at
the
cross-roads
,
the
prince
glanced
around
him
,
*NL*
quickly
crossed
the
road
towards
the
lighted
window
of
a
neighbouring
*NL*
house
,
and
unfolded
a
tiny
scrap
of
paper
which
he
had
held
clasped
in
*NL*
his
right
hand
during
the
whole
of
his
conversation
with
the
general
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
read
the
note
in
the
uncertain
rays
that
fell
from
the
window
.
It
was
*NL*
as
follows
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tomorrow
morning
,
I
shall
be
at
the
green
bench
in
the
park
at
seven
,
*NL*
and
shall
wait
there
for
you
.
I
have
made
up
my
mind
to
speak
to
you
*NL*
about
a
most
important
matter
which
closely
concerns
yourself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
P.S.
--
I
trust
that
you
will
not
show
this
note
to
anyone
.
Though
I
*NL*
am
ashamed
of
giving
you
such
instructions
,
I
feel
that
I
must
do
so
,
*NL*
considering
what
you
are
.
I
therefore
write
the
words
,
and
blush
for
*NL*
your
simple
character
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
P.P.S.
--
It
is
the
same
green
bench
that
I
showed
you
before
.
There
!
*NL*
are
n't
you
ashamed
of
yourself
?
I
felt
that
it
was
necessary
to
repeat
*NL*
even
that
information
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
note
was
written
and
folded
anyhow
,
evidently
in
a
great
hurry
,
and
*NL*
probably
just
before
Aglaya
had
come
down
to
the
verandah
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
inexpressible
agitation
,
amounting
almost
to
fear
,
the
prince
slipped
*NL*
quickly
away
from
the
window
,
away
from
the
light
,
like
a
frightened
*NL*
thief
,
but
as
he
did
so
he
collided
violently
with
some
gentleman
who
*NL*
seemed
to
spring
from
the
earth
at
his
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
watching
for
you
,
prince
,
''
said
the
individual
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
you
,
Keller
?
''
said
the
prince
,
in
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
've
been
looking
for
you
.
I
waited
for
you
at
the
Epanchins
'
*NL*
house
,
but
of
course
I
could
not
come
in
.
I
dogged
you
from
behind
*NL*
as
you
walked
along
with
the
general
.
Well
,
prince
,
here
is
Keller
,
*NL*
absolutely
at
your
service
--
command
him
!
--
ready
to
sacrifice
*NL*
himself
--
even
to
die
in
case
of
need
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But-why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
why
?
--
Of
course
you
'll
be
challenged
!
That
was
young
Lieutenant
*NL*
Moloftsoff
.
I
know
him
,
or
rather
of
him
;
he
wo
n't
pass
an
insult
.
He
*NL*
will
take
no
notice
of
Rogojin
and
myself
,
and
,
therefore
,
you
are
the
*NL*
only
one
left
to
account
for
.
You
'll
have
to
pay
the
piper
,
prince
.
He
*NL*
has
been
asking
about
you
,
and
undoubtedly
his
friend
will
call
on
you
*NL*
tomorrow
--
perhaps
he
is
at
your
house
already
.
If
you
would
do
me
the
*NL*
honour
to
have
me
for
a
second
,
prince
,
I
should
be
happy
.
That
's
why
I
*NL*
have
been
looking
for
you
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Duel
!
You
've
come
to
talk
about
a
duel
,
too
!
''
The
prince
burst
*NL*
out
laughing
,
to
the
great
astonishment
of
Keller
.
He
laughed
*NL*
unrestrainedly
,
and
Keller
,
who
had
been
on
pins
and
needles
,
and
in
a
*NL*
fever
of
excitement
to
offer
himself
as
``
second
,
''
was
very
near
being
*NL*
offended
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
caught
him
by
the
arms
,
you
know
,
prince
.
No
man
of
proper
pride
*NL*
can
stand
that
sort
of
treatment
in
public
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
he
gave
me
a
fearful
dig
in
the
chest
,
''
cried
the
prince
,
*NL*
still
laughing
.
``
What
are
we
to
fight
about
?
I
shall
beg
his
pardon
,
*NL*
that
's
all
.
But
if
we
must
fight
--
we
'll
fight
!
Let
him
have
a
shot
at
*NL*
me
,
by
all
means
;
I
should
rather
like
it
.
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
I
know
how
to
*NL*
load
a
pistol
now
;
do
you
know
how
to
load
a
pistol
,
Keller
?
First
,
you
*NL*
have
to
buy
the
powder
,
you
know
;
it
must
n't
be
wet
,
and
it
must
n't
be
*NL*
that
coarse
stuff
that
they
load
cannons
with
--
it
must
be
pistol
powder
.
*NL*
Then
you
pour
the
powder
in
,
and
get
hold
of
a
bit
of
felt
from
some
*NL*
door
,
and
then
shove
the
bullet
in
.
But
do
n't
shove
the
bullet
in
before
*NL*
the
powder
,
because
the
thing
would
n't
go
off
--
do
you
hear
,
Keller
,
the
*NL*
thing
would
n't
go
off
!
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
Is
n't
that
a
grand
reason
,
Keller
,
*NL*
my
friend
,
eh
?
Do
you
know
,
my
dear
fellow
,
I
really
must
kiss
you
,
and
*NL*
embrace
you
,
this
very
moment
.
Ha
,
ha
!
How
was
it
you
so
suddenly
popped
*NL*
up
in
front
of
me
as
you
did
?
Come
to
my
house
as
soon
as
you
can
,
and
*NL*
we
'll
have
some
champagne
.
We
'll
all
get
drunk
!
Do
you
know
I
have
a
*NL*
dozen
of
champagne
in
Lebedeff
's
cellar
?
Lebedeff
sold
them
to
me
the
*NL*
day
after
I
arrived
.
I
took
the
lot
.
We
'll
invite
everybody
!
Are
you
*NL*
going
to
do
any
sleeping
tonight
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
much
as
usual
,
prince
--
why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pleasant
dreams
then
--
ha
,
ha
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
crossed
the
road
,
and
disappeared
into
the
park
,
leaving
the
*NL*
astonished
Keller
in
a
state
of
ludicrous
wonder
.
He
had
never
before
*NL*
seen
the
prince
in
such
a
strange
condition
of
mind
,
and
could
not
have
*NL*
imagined
the
possibility
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fever
,
probably
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
for
the
man
is
all
nerves
,
and
*NL*
this
business
has
been
a
little
too
much
for
him
.
He
is
not
_
afraid
_
,
*NL*
that
's
clear
;
that
sort
never
funks
!
H
'm
!
champagne
!
That
was
an
*NL*
interesting
item
of
news
,
at
all
events
!
--
Twelve
bottles
!
Dear
me
,
*NL*
that
's
a
very
respectable
little
stock
indeed
!
I
bet
anything
Lebedeff
*NL*
lent
somebody
money
on
deposit
of
this
dozen
of
champagne
.
Hum
!
he
's
a
*NL*
nice
fellow
,
is
this
prince
!
I
like
this
sort
of
man
.
Well
,
I
need
n't
be
*NL*
wasting
time
here
,
and
if
it
's
a
case
of
champagne
,
why
--
there
's
no
time
*NL*
like
the
present
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
the
prince
was
almost
in
a
fever
was
no
more
than
the
truth
.
He
*NL*
wandered
about
the
park
for
a
long
while
,
and
at
last
came
to
himself
in
*NL*
a
lonely
avenue
.
He
was
vaguely
conscious
that
he
had
already
paced
this
*NL*
particular
walk
--
from
that
large
,
dark
tree
to
the
bench
at
the
other
*NL*
end
--
about
a
hundred
yards
altogether
--
at
least
thirty
times
backwards
*NL*
and
forwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
recollecting
what
he
had
been
thinking
of
all
that
time
,
he
could
*NL*
not
.
He
caught
himself
,
however
,
indulging
in
one
thought
which
made
him
*NL*
roar
with
laughter
,
though
there
was
nothing
really
to
laugh
at
in
it
;
*NL*
but
he
felt
that
he
must
laugh
,
and
go
on
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
struck
him
that
the
idea
of
the
duel
might
not
have
occurred
to
*NL*
Keller
alone
,
but
that
his
lesson
in
the
art
of
pistol-loading
might
*NL*
have
been
not
altogether
accidental
!
``
Pooh
!
nonsense
!
''
he
said
to
*NL*
himself
,
struck
by
another
thought
,
of
a
sudden
.
``
Why
,
she
was
immensely
*NL*
surprised
to
find
me
there
on
the
verandah
,
and
laughed
and
talked
about
*NL*
_
tea
!
_
And
yet
she
had
this
little
note
in
her
hand
,
therefore
she
must
*NL*
have
known
that
I
was
sitting
there
.
So
why
was
she
surprised
?
Ha
,
ha
,
*NL*
ha
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
pulled
the
note
out
and
kissed
it
;
then
paused
and
reflected
.
``
How
*NL*
strange
it
all
is
!
how
strange
!
''
he
muttered
,
melancholy
enough
now
.
In
*NL*
moments
of
great
joy
,
he
invariably
felt
a
sensation
of
melancholy
come
*NL*
over
him
--
he
could
not
tell
why
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
intently
around
him
,
and
wondered
why
he
had
come
here
;
he
was
*NL*
very
tired
,
so
he
approached
the
bench
and
sat
down
on
it
.
Around
him
*NL*
was
profound
silence
;
the
music
in
the
Vauxhall
was
over
.
The
park
*NL*
seemed
quite
empty
,
though
it
was
not
,
in
reality
,
later
than
half-past
*NL*
eleven
.
It
was
a
quiet
,
warm
,
clear
night
--
a
real
Petersburg
night
of
*NL*
early
June
;
but
in
the
dense
avenue
,
where
he
was
sitting
,
it
was
almost
*NL*
pitch
dark
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
anyone
had
come
up
at
this
moment
and
told
him
that
he
was
in
love
,
*NL*
passionately
in
love
,
he
would
have
rejected
the
idea
with
astonishment
,
*NL*
and
,
perhaps
,
with
irritation
.
And
if
anyone
had
added
that
Aglaya
's
*NL*
note
was
a
love-letter
,
and
that
it
contained
an
appointment
to
a
*NL*
lover
's
rendezvous
,
he
would
have
blushed
with
shame
for
the
speaker
,
*NL*
and
,
probably
,
have
challenged
him
to
a
duel
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
would
have
been
perfectly
sincere
on
his
part
.
He
had
never
*NL*
for
a
moment
entertained
the
idea
of
the
possibility
of
this
girl
loving
*NL*
him
,
or
even
of
such
a
thing
as
himself
falling
in
love
with
her
.
The
*NL*
possibility
of
being
loved
himself
,
``
a
man
like
me
,
''
as
he
put
it
,
he
*NL*
ranked
among
ridiculous
suppositions
.
It
appeared
to
him
that
it
was
*NL*
simply
a
joke
on
Aglaya
's
part
,
if
there
really
were
anything
in
it
at
*NL*
all
;
but
that
seemed
to
him
quite
natural
.
His
preoccupation
was
caused
*NL*
by
something
different
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
the
few
words
which
the
general
had
let
slip
about
Aglaya
laughing
*NL*
at
everybody
,
and
at
himself
most
of
all
--
he
entirely
believed
them
.
He
*NL*
did
not
feel
the
slightest
sensation
of
offence
;
on
the
contrary
,
he
was
*NL*
quite
certain
that
it
was
as
it
should
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
whole
thoughts
were
now
as
to
next
morning
early
;
he
would
see
*NL*
her
;
he
would
sit
by
her
on
that
little
green
bench
,
and
listen
to
how
*NL*
pistols
were
loaded
,
and
look
at
her
.
He
wanted
nothing
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
question
as
to
what
she
might
have
to
say
of
special
interest
to
*NL*
himself
occurred
to
him
once
or
twice
.
He
did
not
doubt
,
for
a
moment
,
*NL*
that
she
really
had
some
such
subject
of
conversation
in
store
,
but
so
*NL*
very
little
interested
in
the
matter
was
he
that
it
did
not
strike
him
*NL*
to
wonder
what
it
could
be
.
The
crunch
of
gravel
on
the
path
suddenly
*NL*
caused
him
to
raise
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
man
,
whose
face
it
was
difficult
to
see
in
the
gloom
,
approached
the
*NL*
bench
,
and
sat
down
beside
him
.
The
prince
peered
into
his
face
,
and
*NL*
recognized
the
livid
features
of
Rogojin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
you
'd
be
wandering
about
somewhere
here
.
I
did
n't
have
to
look
*NL*
for
you
very
long
,
''
muttered
the
latter
between
his
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
first
time
they
had
met
since
the
encounter
on
the
staircase
*NL*
at
the
hotel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Painfully
surprised
as
he
was
at
this
sudden
apparition
of
Rogojin
,
*NL*
the
prince
,
for
some
little
while
,
was
unable
to
collect
his
thoughts
.
*NL*
Rogojin
,
evidently
,
saw
and
understood
the
impression
he
had
made
;
and
*NL*
though
he
seemed
more
or
less
confused
at
first
,
yet
he
began
talking
*NL*
with
what
looked
like
assumed
ease
and
freedom
.
However
,
the
prince
soon
*NL*
changed
his
mind
on
this
score
,
and
thought
that
there
was
not
only
no
*NL*
affectation
of
indifference
,
but
that
Rogojin
was
not
even
particularly
*NL*
agitated
.
If
there
were
a
little
apparent
awkwardness
,
it
was
only
in
*NL*
his
words
and
gestures
.
The
man
could
not
change
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
did
you
--
find
me
here
?
''
asked
the
prince
for
the
sake
of
saying
*NL*
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Keller
told
me
-LRB-
I
found
him
at
your
place
-RRB-
that
you
were
in
the
park
.
*NL*
`
Of
course
he
is
!
'
I
thought
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
so
?
''
asked
the
prince
uneasily
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rogojin
smiled
,
but
did
not
explain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
received
your
letter
,
Lef
Nicolaievitch
--
what
's
the
good
of
all
*NL*
that
?
--
It
's
no
use
,
you
know
.
I
've
come
to
you
from
_
her
_
,
--
she
bade
me
*NL*
tell
you
that
she
must
see
you
,
she
has
something
to
say
to
you
.
She
*NL*
told
me
to
find
you
today
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
come
tomorrow
.
Now
I
'm
going
home
--
are
you
coming
to
my
house
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
I
?
I
've
given
you
the
message
.
--
Goodbye
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo
n't
you
come
?
''
asked
the
prince
in
a
gentle
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
an
extraordinary
man
you
are
!
I
wonder
at
you
!
''
Rogojin
laughed
*NL*
sarcastically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
hate
me
so
?
''
asked
the
prince
,
sadly
.
``
You
know
yourself
*NL*
that
all
you
suspected
is
quite
unfounded
.
I
felt
you
were
still
angry
*NL*
with
me
,
though
.
Do
you
know
why
?
Because
you
tried
to
kill
me
--
that
's
*NL*
why
you
ca
n't
shake
off
your
wrath
against
me
.
I
tell
you
that
I
only
*NL*
remember
the
Parfen
Rogojin
with
whom
I
exchanged
crosses
,
and
vowed
*NL*
brotherhood
.
I
wrote
you
this
in
yesterday
's
letter
,
in
order
that
you
*NL*
might
forget
all
that
madness
on
your
part
,
and
that
you
might
not
feel
*NL*
called
to
talk
about
it
when
we
met
.
Why
do
you
avoid
me
?
Why
do
you
*NL*
hold
your
hand
back
from
me
?
I
tell
you
again
,
I
consider
all
that
has
*NL*
passed
a
delirium
,
an
insane
dream
.
I
can
understand
all
you
did
,
*NL*
and
all
you
felt
that
day
,
as
if
it
were
myself
.
What
you
were
then
*NL*
imagining
was
not
the
case
,
and
could
never
be
the
case
.
Why
,
then
,
*NL*
should
there
be
anger
between
us
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
know
what
anger
is
!
''
laughed
Rogojin
,
in
reply
to
the
*NL*
prince
's
heated
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
moved
a
pace
or
two
away
,
and
was
hiding
his
hands
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
come
to
your
house
again
,
''
he
added
*NL*
slowly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
Do
you
hate
me
so
much
as
all
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
love
you
,
Lef
Nicolaievitch
,
and
,
therefore
,
what
would
be
*NL*
the
use
of
my
coming
to
see
you
?
You
are
just
like
a
child
--
you
want
a
*NL*
plaything
,
and
it
must
be
taken
out
and
given
you
--
and
then
you
do
n't
*NL*
know
how
to
work
it
.
You
are
simply
repeating
all
you
said
in
your
*NL*
letter
,
and
what
's
the
use
?
Of
course
I
believe
every
word
you
say
,
and
*NL*
I
know
perfectly
well
that
you
neither
did
or
ever
can
deceive
me
in
*NL*
any
way
,
and
yet
,
I
do
n't
love
you
.
You
write
that
you
've
forgotten
*NL*
everything
,
and
only
remember
your
brother
Parfen
,
with
whom
you
*NL*
exchanged
crosses
,
and
that
you
do
n't
remember
anything
about
the
*NL*
Rogojin
who
aimed
a
knife
at
your
throat
.
What
do
you
know
about
my
*NL*
feelings
,
eh
?
''
-LRB-
Rogojin
laughed
disagreeably
.
-RRB-
``
Here
you
are
holding
out
*NL*
your
brotherly
forgiveness
to
me
for
a
thing
that
I
have
perhaps
never
*NL*
repented
of
in
the
slightest
degree
.
I
did
not
think
of
it
again
all
*NL*
that
evening
;
all
my
thoughts
were
centred
on
something
else
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
think
of
it
again
?
Of
course
you
did
n't
!
''
cried
the
prince
.
``
And
I
*NL*
dare
swear
that
you
came
straight
away
down
here
to
Pavlofsk
to
listen
*NL*
to
the
music
and
dog
her
about
in
the
crowd
,
and
stare
at
her
,
just
as
*NL*
you
did
today
.
There
's
nothing
surprising
in
that
!
If
you
had
n't
been
in
*NL*
that
condition
of
mind
that
you
could
think
of
nothing
but
one
subject
,
*NL*
you
would
,
probably
,
never
have
raised
your
knife
against
me
.
I
had
a
*NL*
presentiment
of
what
you
would
do
,
that
day
,
ever
since
I
saw
you
first
*NL*
in
the
morning
.
Do
you
know
yourself
what
you
looked
like
?
I
knew
*NL*
you
would
try
to
murder
me
even
at
the
very
moment
when
we
exchanged
*NL*
crosses
.
What
did
you
take
me
to
your
mother
for
?
Did
you
think
to
stay
*NL*
your
hand
by
doing
so
?
Perhaps
you
did
not
put
your
thoughts
into
words
,
*NL*
but
you
and
I
were
thinking
the
same
thing
,
or
feeling
the
same
thing
*NL*
looming
over
us
,
at
the
same
moment
.
What
should
you
think
of
me
now
if
*NL*
you
had
not
raised
your
knife
to
me
--
the
knife
which
God
averted
from
my
*NL*
throat
?
I
would
have
been
guilty
of
suspecting
you
all
the
same
--
and
you
*NL*
would
have
intended
the
murder
all
the
same
;
therefore
we
should
have
*NL*
been
mutually
guilty
in
any
case
.
Come
,
do
n't
frown
;
you
need
n't
laugh
*NL*
at
me
,
either
.
You
say
you
have
n't
`
repented
.
'
Repented
!
You
probably
*NL*
could
n't
,
if
you
were
to
try
;
you
dislike
me
too
much
for
that
.
Why
,
*NL*
if
I
were
an
angel
of
light
,
and
as
innocent
before
you
as
a
babe
,
you
*NL*
would
still
loathe
me
if
you
believed
that
_
she
_
loved
me
,
instead
of
*NL*
loving
yourself
.
That
's
jealousy
--
that
is
the
real
jealousy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
do
you
know
what
I
have
been
thinking
out
during
this
last
week
,
*NL*
Parfen
?
I
'll
tell
you
.
What
if
she
loves
you
now
better
than
anyone
?
And
*NL*
what
if
she
torments
you
_
because
_
she
loves
you
,
and
in
proportion
to
her
*NL*
love
for
you
,
so
she
torments
you
the
more
?
She
wo
n't
tell
you
this
,
of
*NL*
course
;
you
must
have
eyes
to
see
.
Why
do
you
suppose
she
consents
to
*NL*
marry
you
?
She
must
have
a
reason
,
and
that
reason
she
will
tell
you
*NL*
some
day
.
Some
women
desire
the
kind
of
love
you
give
her
,
and
she
is
*NL*
probably
one
of
these
.
Your
love
and
your
wild
nature
impress
her
.
Do
*NL*
you
know
that
a
woman
is
capable
of
driving
a
man
crazy
almost
,
with
*NL*
her
cruelties
and
mockeries
,
and
feels
not
one
single
pang
of
regret
,
*NL*
because
she
looks
at
him
and
says
to
herself
,
`
There
!
I
'll
torment
this
*NL*
man
nearly
into
his
grave
,
and
then
,
oh
!
how
I
'll
compensate
him
for
it
*NL*
all
with
my
love
!
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rogojin
listened
to
the
end
,
and
then
burst
out
laughing
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
prince
,
I
declare
you
must
have
had
a
taste
of
this
sort
of
thing
*NL*
yourself
--
have
n't
you
?
I
have
heard
tell
of
something
of
the
kind
,
you
*NL*
know
;
is
it
true
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
What
can
you
have
heard
?
''
said
the
prince
,
stammering
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rogojin
continued
to
laugh
loudly
.
He
had
listened
to
the
prince
's
*NL*
speech
with
curiosity
and
some
satisfaction
.
The
speaker
's
impulsive
*NL*
warmth
had
surprised
and
even
comforted
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
've
not
only
heard
of
it
;
I
see
it
for
myself
,
''
he
said
.
``
When
*NL*
have
you
ever
spoken
like
that
before
?
It
was
n't
like
yourself
,
prince
.
*NL*
Why
,
if
I
had
n't
heard
this
report
about
you
,
I
should
never
have
come
*NL*
all
this
way
into
the
park
--
at
midnight
,
too
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
you
in
the
least
,
Parfen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
_
she
_
told
me
all
about
it
long
ago
,
and
tonight
I
saw
for
myself
.
*NL*
I
saw
you
at
the
music
,
you
know
,
and
whom
you
were
sitting
with
.
She
*NL*
swore
to
me
yesterday
,
and
again
today
,
that
you
are
madly
in
love
with
*NL*
Aglaya
Ivanovna
.
But
that
's
all
the
same
to
me
,
prince
,
and
it
's
not
my
*NL*
affair
at
all
;
for
if
you
have
ceased
to
love
_
her
_
,
_
she
_
has
not
ceased
*NL*
to
love
_
you

.
You
know
,
of
course
,
that
she
wants
to
marry
you
to
that
*NL*
girl
?
She
's
sworn
to
it
!
Ha
,
ha
!
She
says
to
me
,
`
Until
then
I
wo
n't
marry
*NL*
you
.
When
they
go
to
church
,
we
'll
go
too
--
and
not
before
.
'
What
on
earth
*NL*
does
she
mean
by
it
?
I
do
n't
know
,
and
I
never
did
.
Either
she
loves
you
*NL*
without
limits
or
--
yet
,
if
she
loves
you
,
why
does
she
wish
to
marry
*NL*
you
to
another
girl
?
She
says
,
'
I
want
to
see
him
happy
,
'
which
is
to
*NL*
say
--
she
loves
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wrote
,
and
I
say
to
you
once
more
,
that
she
is
not
in
her
right
*NL*
mind
,
''
said
the
prince
,
who
had
listened
with
anguish
to
what
Rogojin
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Goodness
knows
--
you
may
be
wrong
there
!
At
all
events
,
she
named
the
*NL*
day
this
evening

as
we
left
the
gardens
.
`
In
three
weeks
,
'
says
she
,
*NL*
`
and
perhaps
sooner
,
we
shall
be
married
.
'
She
swore
to
it
,
took
off
her
*NL*
cross
and
kissed
it
.
So
it
all
depends
upon
you
now
,
prince
,
You
see
!
*NL*
Ha
,
ha
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
all
madness

you

about

Tomorrow

I
shall
come

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
she
be
mad

''
Rogojin
interrupted
,
``
when
she
is
sane
enough
for

other
people

only
mad
for
you

How
can
she
write
letters

_
her

,
if

mad

If

were
insane
they
would
observe
it
in

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
letters

said
the
prince
,
alarmed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
writes
to
_
her

the

reads
the

Have
n't
you

You
are
sure
to
hear

she

sure
to
show
you
the
letters

herself

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

cried
the
prince

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

only
gone
a

Wait

Before
long

*NL*
*NL*
``
Drop
that
subject

Rogojin

never
mention
it
again

And
listen
:
*NL*
as
I
have
sat
here
,
and
talked
,
and
listened
,
it
has
suddenly
struck
me
*NL*
that
tomorrow

my

It

be
about
twelve
o'clock

now

the

*NL*
*NL*
IV
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
observed
with
great
surprise
,
as
he
approached
his
villa
,
*NL*
accompanied
by
Rogojin
,
that
a
large
number
of
people
were
assembled
on
*NL*
his
verandah
,
which
was
brilliantly
lighted
up
.
The
company
seemed
merry
*NL*
and
were
noisily
laughing
and
talking
--
even
quarrelling
,
to
judge
from
*NL*
the
sounds
.
At
all
events
they
were
clearly
enjoying
themselves
,
and
*NL*
the
prince
observed
further
on
closer
investigation
--
that
all
had
been
*NL*
drinking
champagne
.
To
judge
from
the
lively
condition
of
some
of
the
*NL*
party
,
it
was
to
be
supposed
that
a
considerable
quantity
of
champagne
*NL*
had
been
consumed
already
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
guests
were
known
to
the
prince
;
but
the
curious
part
of
the
*NL*
matter
was
that
they
had
all
arrived
on
the
same
evening
,
as
though
with
*NL*
one
accord
,
although
he
had
only
himself
recollected
the
fact
that
it
*NL*
was
his
birthday
a
few
moments
since
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
have
told
somebody
you
were
going
to
trot
out
the
champagne
,
*NL*
and
that
's
why
they
are
all
come
!
''
muttered
Rogojin
,
as
the
two
entered
*NL*
the
verandah
.
``
We
know
all
about
that
!
You
've
only
to
whistle
and
they
*NL*
come
up
in
shoals
!
''
he
continued
,
almost
angrily
.
He
was
doubtless
*NL*
thinking
of
his
own
late
experiences
with
his
boon
companions
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
surrounded
the
prince
with
exclamations
of
welcome
,
and
,
on
hearing
*NL*
that
it
was
his
birthday
,
with
cries
of
congratulation
and
delight
;
many
*NL*
of
them
were
very
noisy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
presence
of
certain
of
those
in
the
room
surprised
the
prince
*NL*
vastly
,
but
the
guest
whose
advent
filled
him
with
the
greatest
*NL*
wonder
--
almost
amounting
to
alarm
--
was
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
.
The
prince
*NL*
could
not
believe
his
eyes
when
he
beheld
the
latter
,
and
could
not
help
*NL*
thinking
that
something
was
wrong
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lebedeff
ran
up
promptly
to
explain
the
arrival
of
all
these
gentlemen
.
*NL*
He
was
himself
somewhat
intoxicated
,
but
the
prince
gathered
from
his
*NL*
long-winded
periods
that
the
party
had
assembled
quite
naturally
,
and
*NL*
accidentally
.
*NL*
*NL*
First
of
all
Hippolyte
had
arrived
,
early
in
the
evening
,
and
feeling
*NL*
decidedly
better
,
had
determined
to
await
the
prince
on
the
verandah
.
*NL*
There
Lebedeff
had
joined
him
,
and
his
household
had
followed
--
that
is
,
*NL*
his
daughters
and
General
Ivolgin
.
Burdovsky
had
brought
Hippolyte
,
and
*NL*
stayed
on
with
him
.
Gania
and
Ptitsin
had
dropped
in
accidentally
later
*NL*
on
;
then
came
Keller
,
and
he
and
Colia
insisted
on
having
champagne
.
*NL*
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
had
only
dropped
in
half
an
hour
or
so
ago
.
Lebedeff
*NL*
had
served
the
champagne
readily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
own
though
,
prince
,
my
own
,
mind
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
there
'll
be
some
*NL*
supper
later
on
;
my
daughter
is
getting
it
ready
now
.
Come
and
sit
down
,
*NL*
prince
,
we
are
all
waiting
for
you
,
we
want
you
with
us
.
Fancy
what
we
*NL*
have
been
discussing
!
You
know
the
question
,
`
to
be
or
not
to
be
,
'
--
out
*NL*
of
Hamlet
!
A
contemporary
theme
!
Quite
up-to-date
!
Mr.
Hippolyte
has
*NL*
been
eloquent
to
a
degree
.
He
wo
n't
go
to
bed
,
but
he
has
only
drunk
a
*NL*
little
champagne
,
and
that
ca
n't
do
him
any
harm
.
Come
along
,
prince
,
*NL*
and
settle
the
question
.
Everyone
is
waiting
for
you
,
sighing
for
the
*NL*
light
of
your
luminous
intelligence
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
noticed
the
sweet
,
welcoming
look
on
Vera
Lebedeff
's
face
,
as
*NL*
she
made
her
way
towards
him
through
the
crowd
.
He
held
out
his
hand
to
*NL*
her
.
She
took
it
,
blushing
with
delight
,
and
wished
him
``
a
happy
life
*NL*
from
that
day
forward
.
''
Then
she
ran
off
to
the
kitchen
,
where
her
*NL*
presence
was
necessary
to
help
in
the
preparations
for
supper
.
Before
*NL*
the
prince
's
arrival
she
had
spent
some
time
on
the
terrace
,
listening
*NL*
eagerly
to
the
conversation
,
though
the
visitors
,
mostly
under
the
*NL*
influence
of
wine
,
were
discussing
abstract
subjects
far
beyond
her
*NL*
comprehension
.
In
the
next
room
her
younger
sister
lay
on
a
wooden
*NL*
chest
,
sound
asleep
,
with
her
mouth
wide
open
;
but
the
boy
,
Lebedeff
's
*NL*
son
,
had
taken
up
his
position
close
beside
Colia
and
Hippolyte
,
his
*NL*
face
lit
up
with
interest
in
the
conversation
of
his
father
and
the
*NL*
rest
,
to
which
he
would
willingly
have
listened
for
ten
hours
at
a
*NL*
stretch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
waited
for
you
on
purpose
,
and
am
very
glad
to
see
you
arrive
so
*NL*
happy
,
''
said
Hippolyte
,
when
the
prince
came
forward
to
press
his
hand
,
*NL*
immediately
after
greeting
Vera
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
do
you
know
that
I
am
`
so
happy
'
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
see
it
by
your
face
!
Say
`
how
do
you
do
'
to
the
others
,
and
*NL*
come
and
sit
down
here
,
quick
--
I
've
been
waiting
for
you
!
''
he
added
,
*NL*
accentuating
the
fact
that
he
had
waited
.
On
the
prince
's
asking
,
``
Will
*NL*
it
not
be
injurious
to
you
to
sit
out
so
late
?
''
he
replied
that
he
could
*NL*
not
believe
that
he
had
thought
himself
dying
three
days
or
so
ago
,
for
*NL*
he
never
had
felt
better
than
this
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
Burdovsky
next
jumped
up
and
explained
that
he
had
come
in
by
accident
,
*NL*
having
escorted
Hippolyte
from
town
.
He
murmured
that
he
was
glad
he
*NL*
had
``
written
nonsense
''
in
his
letter
,
and
then
pressed
the
prince
's
hand
*NL*
warmly
and
sat
down
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
approached
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
last
of
all
.
The
latter
*NL*
immediately
took
his
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
a
couple
of
words
to
say
to
you
,
''
he
began
,
``
and
those
on
a
very
*NL*
important
matter
;
let
's
go
aside
for
a
minute
or
two
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
a
couple
of
words
!
''
whispered
another
voice
in
the
prince
's
other
*NL*
ear
,
and
another
hand
took
his
other
arm
.
Muishkin
turned
,
and
to
his
*NL*
great
surprise
observed
a
red
,
flushed
face
and
a
droll-looking
figure
*NL*
which
he
recognized
at
once
as
that
of
Ferdishenko
.
Goodness
knows
where
*NL*
he
had
turned
up
from
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
remember
Ferdishenko
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
have
you
dropped
from
?
''
cried
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
sorry
for
his
sins
now
,
prince
,
''
cried
Keller
.
``
He
did
not
*NL*
want
to
let
you
know
he
was
here
;
he
was
hidden
over
there
in
the
*NL*
corner
,
--
but
he
repents
now
,
he
feels

Why

has
he
done

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
met
him
outside

brought
him
in

he

a
gentleman

often
allow

friends
to
see
him
,
of
late

but
he
's
sorry
now

*NL*
*NL*
``
Delighted

I
'm
sure

I
'll
come
back
directly

down

there
with
the
others

excuse
me
one
moment

said
the
host
,
*NL*
getting
away
with
difficulty
in
order
to
follow
Evgenie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very
gay
here
,
''
began
the
latter
,
``
and
I
have
had
quite
*NL*
a
pleasant
half-hour
while
I
waited
for
you
.
Now
then
,
my
dear
Lef
*NL*
Nicolaievitch
,
this
is
what
's
the
matter

I
've
arranged
it
all
with
*NL*
Moloftsoff
,
and
have
just
come
in
to
relieve
your
mind
on
that
score
.
*NL*
You
need
be
under
no
apprehensions
.
He
was
very
sensible
,
as
he
should
*NL*
be
,
of
course
,
for
I
think
he
was
entirely
to
blame
himself

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
Moloftsoff
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
young
fellow
whose
arms
you
held

do

you
know

He
was
so
wild

with
you
that
he
was
going
to
send
a
friend
to
you
tomorrow
morning

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
nonsense
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
it
is
nonsense
,
and
in
nonsense
it
would
have
ended
,
*NL*
doubtless
;
but
you
know
these
fellows
,
they
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
but
I
think
you
must
have
something
else
that
you
wished
to
*NL*
speak
about
,
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
I
have
!
''
said
the
other
,
laughing
.
``
You
see
,
my
dear
fellow
,
*NL*
tomorrow
,
very
early
in
the
morning
,
I
must
be
off
to
town
about
this
*NL*
unfortunate
business
-LRB-
my
uncle
,
you
know
!
-RRB-
.
Just
imagine
,
my
dear
sir
,
it
*NL*
is
all
true
--
word
for
word
--
and
,
of
course
,
everybody
knew
it
excepting
*NL*
myself
.
All
this
has
been
such
a
blow
to
me
that
I
have
not
managed
to
*NL*
call
in
at
the
Epanchins
'
.
Tomorrow
I
shall
not
see
them
either
,
because
*NL*
I
shall
be
in
town
.
I
may
not
be
here
for
three
days
or
more
;
in
a
word
,
*NL*
my
affairs
are
a
little
out
of
gear
.
But
though
my
town
business
is
,
*NL*
of
course
,
most
pressing
,
still
I
determined
not
to
go
away
until
I
had
*NL*
seen
you
,
and
had
a
clear
understanding
with
you
upon
certain
points
;
*NL*
and
that
without
loss
of
time
.
I
will
wait
now
,
if
you
will
allow
me
,
*NL*
until
the
company
departs
;
I
may
just
as
well
,
for
I
have
nowhere
else
*NL*
to
go
to
,
and
I
shall
certainly
not
do
any
sleeping
tonight
;
I
'm
far
too
*NL*
excited
.
And
finally
,
I
must
confess
that
,
though
I
know
it
is
bad
form
*NL*
to
pursue
a
man
in
this
way
,
I
have
come
to
beg
your
friendship
,
my
*NL*
dear
prince
.
You
are
an
unusual
sort
of
a
person
;
you
do
n't
lie
at
every
*NL*
step
,
as
some
men
do
;
in
fact
,
you
do
n't
lie
at
all
,
and
there
is
a
*NL*
matter
in
which
I
need
a
true
and
sincere
friend
,
for
I
really
may
claim
*NL*
to
be
among
the
number
of
bona
fide
unfortunates
just
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
laughed
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
trouble
is
,
''
said
the
prince
,
after
a
slight
pause
for
*NL*
reflection
,
``
that
goodness
only
knows
when
this
party
will
break
up
.
*NL*
Had
n't
we
better
stroll
into
the
park
?
I
'll
excuse
myself
,
there
's
no
*NL*
danger
of
their
going
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
!
I
have
my
reasons
for
wishing
them
not
to
suspect
us
of
being
*NL*
engaged
in
any
specially
important
conversation
.
There
are
gentry
*NL*
present
who
are
a
little
too
much
interested
in
us
.
You
are
not
aware
of
*NL*
that
perhaps
,
prince
?
It
will
be
a
great
deal
better
if
they
see
that
*NL*
we
are
friendly
just
in
an
ordinary
way
.
They
'll
all
go
in
a
couple
of
*NL*
hours
,
and
then
I
'll
ask
you
to
give
me
twenty
minutes-half
an
hour
at
*NL*
most
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
all
means
!
I
assure
you
I
am
delighted

you
need
not
have
entered
*NL*
into
all
these
explanations
.
As
for
your
remarks
about
friendship
with
*NL*
me
--
thanks
,
very
much
indeed
.
You
must
excuse
my
being
a
little
absent
*NL*
this
evening
.
Do
you
know
,
I
can
not
somehow
be
attentive
to
anything
*NL*
just
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
,
I
see
,
''
said
Evgenie
,
smiling
gently
.
His
mirth
seemed
very
near
*NL*
the
surface
this
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
see
?
''
said
the
prince
,
startled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
you
to
suspect
that
I
have
simply
come
here
to
deceive
*NL*
you
and
pump
information
out
of
you
!
''
said
Evgenie
,
still
smiling
,
and
*NL*
without
making
any
direct
reply
to
the
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
I
have
n't
the
slightest
doubt
that
you
did
come
to
pump
me
,
''
*NL*
said
the
prince
,
laughing
himself
,
at
last
;
``
and
I
dare
say
you
are
*NL*
quite
prepared
to
deceive
me
too
,
so
far
as
that
goes
.
But
what
of
that
?
*NL*
I
'm
not
afraid
of
you
;
besides
,
you
'll
hardly
believe
it
,
I
feel
*NL*
as
though
I
really
did
n't
care
a
scrap
one
way
or
the
other
,
just
*NL*
now
!
--
And
--
and
--
and
as
you
are
a
capital
fellow
,
I
am
convinced
of
that
,
I
*NL*
dare
say
we
really
shall
end
by
being
good
friends
.
I
like
you
very
much
*NL*
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
;
I
consider
you
a
very
good
fellow
indeed

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

in
any
case

you
are
a
most
delightful
man
to
have
to
deal
with

the
business
what
it
may

concluded
Evgenie
.
``
Come
along
now
,
I
'll
*NL*
drink
a
glass
to
your
health

I
'm
charmed
to
have
entered
into
alliance
*NL*
with
you
.
By-the-by
,
''
he
added
suddenly
,
``
has
this
young
Hippolyte
come
*NL*
down
to
stay
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
not
going
to
die
at
once

I
should
think
,
is
he

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
know
.
I
've
been
half
an
hour
here
with
him
,
and
he
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hippolyte
had
been
waiting
for
the
prince
all
this
time
,
and
had
never
*NL*
ceased
looking
at
him
and
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
as
they
conversed
in
the
*NL*
corner
.
He
became
much
excited
when
they
approached
the
table
once
more
.
*NL*
He
was
disturbed
in
his
mind
,
it
seemed
;
perspiration
stood
in
large
*NL*
drops
on
his
forehead
;
in
his
gleaming
eyes
it
was
easy
to
read
*NL*
impatience
and
agitation
;
his
gaze
wandered
from
face
to
face
of
those
*NL*
present
,
and
from
object
to
object
in
the
room
,
apparently
without
aim
.
*NL*
He
had
taken
a
part
,
and
an
animated
one
,
in
the
noisy
conversation
of
*NL*
the
company
;
but
his
animation
was
clearly
the
outcome
of
fever
.
His
*NL*
talk
was
almost
incoherent
;
he
would
break
off
in
the
middle
of
a
*NL*
sentence
which
he
had
begun
with
great
interest
,
and
forget
what
he
had
*NL*
been
saying
.
The
prince
discovered
to
his
dismay
that
Hippolyte
had
been
*NL*
allowed
to
drink
two
large
glasses
of
champagne
;
the
one
now
standing
by
*NL*
him
being
the
third
.
All
this
he
found
out
afterwards
;
at
the
moment
he
*NL*
did
not
notice
anything
,
very
particularly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
I
am
specially
glad
that
today
is
your
birthday
!
''
cried
*NL*
Hippolyte
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
soon
see
.
D'you
know
I
had
a
feeling
that
there
would
be
a
lot
*NL*
of
people
here
tonight
?
It
's
not
the
first
time
that
my
presentiments
*NL*
have
been
fulfilled
.
I
wish
I
had
known
it
was
your
birthday
,
I
'd
have
*NL*
brought
you
a
present
--
perhaps
I
have
got
a
present
for
you
!
Who
knows
?
*NL*
Ha
,
ha
!
How
long
is
it
now
before
daylight
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
couple
of
hours
,
''
said
Ptitsin
,
looking
at
his
watch
.
``
What
's
the
*NL*
good
of
daylight
now
?
One
can
read
all
night
in
the
open
air
without

it

said
someone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
good
of
it
!
Well
,
I
want
just
to
see
a
ray
of
the
sun

said
*NL*
Hippolyte
.
``
Can
one
drink
to
the
sun
's
health
,
do
you
think
,
prince
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
dare
say
one
can
;
but
you
had
better
be
calm
and
lie
down

*NL*
Hippolyte
--
that
's
much
more
important
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
always
preaching
about
resting

you
are
a
regular
nurse
to
me

*NL*
prince

As
soon
as
the
sun
begins
to
`
resound
'
in
the
sky
--
what
poet
*NL*
said
that
?
`
The
sun
resounded
in
the
sky

It
is
beautiful
,
though
*NL*
there
's
no
sense
in
it
!

then
we
will
go
to
bed

Lebedeff
,
tell
me
,
is
*NL*
the
sun
the
source
of
life
?
What
does
the
source

or
`
spring

of
life
*NL*
really
mean
in
the
Apocalypse
?
You
have
heard
of
the
`
Star
that
is
*NL*
called
Wormwood
,
'
prince
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
heard
that
Lebedeff
explains
it
as
the
railroads
that
cover
*NL*
Europe
like
a
net
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Everybody
laughed
,
and
Lebedeff
got
up
abruptly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
Allow
me
,
that
is
not
what
we
are
discussing
!
''
he
cried
,
waving
*NL*
his
hand
to
impose
silence
.
``
Allow
me
!
With
these
gentlemen
...
all
*NL*
these
gentlemen
,
''
he
added
,
suddenly
addressing
the
prince
,
``
on
certain
*NL*
points
...
that
is
...
''
He
thumped
the
table
repeatedly
,
and
the
laughter
*NL*
increased
.
Lebedeff
was
in
his
usual
evening
condition
,
and
had
just
*NL*
ended
a
long
and
scientific
argument
,
which
had
left
him
excited
and
*NL*
irritable
.
On
such
occasions
he
was
apt
to
evince
a
supreme
contempt
for
*NL*
his
opponents
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
right
!
Half
an
hour
ago
,
prince
,
it
was
agreed
among
us
that
*NL*
no
one
should
interrupt
,
no
one
should
laugh
,
that
each
person
was
to
*NL*
express
his
thoughts
freely
;
and
then
at
the
end
,
when
everyone
had
*NL*
spoken
,
objections
might
be
made
,
even
by
the
atheists
.
We
chose
the
*NL*
general
as
president
.
Now
without
some
such
rule
and
order
,
anyone
might
*NL*
be
shouted
down
,
even
in
the
loftiest
and
most
profound
thought
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
on
!
Go
on
!
Nobody
is
going
to
interrupt
you
!

cried
several
voices
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak
,
but
keep
to
the
point

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
this
`

asked
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no

replied
General
Ivolgin
,
who
presided
with
much
*NL*
gravity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
love
these
arguments

said
Keller
,
also
more
than
half
*NL*
intoxicated
,
moving
restlessly
in
his
chair
.
``
Scientific

political

*NL*
Then
,
turning
suddenly
towards
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
,
who
was
seated
near
*NL*
him
:
``
Do
you
know

simply
adore

the
accounts

debates

the
discussions
themselves
interest
*NL*
me

I
am
not
a
politician

it
delights
me

see
how
they

noble

agrees
with

honourable

astonished
Europe

all
these
expressions

all
this
parliamentarism
of
*NL*
a
free
people

has
an
enormous
attraction
for
me

It
fascinates
me

I
have
always
been
an
artist
in

depths

you

*NL*
``

cried
Gania

from
the
other
corner
,
``
do
you
mean

to
say
that
railways
are
accursed
inventions

they
are
a
source

ruin
to
humanity

a
poison
poured

''
*NL*
*NL*
Gavrila
Ardalionovitch
was
in
high
spirits
that
evening
,
and
it
seemed
*NL*
to
the
prince
that
his
gaiety
was
mingled
with
triumph
.
Of
course
he
was
*NL*
only
joking
with
Lebedeff
,
meaning
to
egg
him
on
,
but
he
grew
excited
*NL*
himself
at
the
same
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
the
railways

oh
dear
,
no

replied
Lebedeff
,
with
a
mixture
of
*NL*
violent
anger
and
extreme
enjoyment
.
``
Considered
alone

the
railways

will
not
pollute

accursed

whole

most

accursed

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
cried
Hippolyte
,
turning
towards
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
,
and
looking
*NL*
at
him
with
a
queer
sort
of
curiosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
seeing
that
Radomski
was
laughing
,
he
began
to
laugh
himself
,
*NL*
nudged
Colia
,
who
was
sitting
beside
him
,
with
his
elbow
,
and
again
*NL*
asked
what
time
it
was
.
He
even
pulled
Colia
's
silver
watch
out
of
his
*NL*
hand
,
and
looked
at
it
eagerly
.
Then
,
as
if
he
had
forgotten
everything
,
*NL*
he
stretched
himself
out
on
the
sofa
,
put
his
hands
behind
his
head
,
and
*NL*
looked
up
at
the
sky
.
After
a
minute
or
two
he
got
up
and
came
back
*NL*
to
the
table
to
listen
to
Lebedeff
's
outpourings
,
as
the
latter
*NL*
passionately
commentated
on
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
's
paradox
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
an
artful
and
traitorous
idea

A
smart
notion

''
vociferated
*NL*
the
clerk
,
``
thrown
out
as
an
apple
of
discord

But
it
is
just
.
You
are

scoffer

a
man
of
the
world
,
a
cavalry
officer
,
and
,
though
not
without
*NL*
brains
,
you
do
not
realize
how
profound
is
your
thought
,
nor
how
true
.
*NL*
Yes
,
the
laws
of
self-preservation
and
of
self-destruction
are
equally
*NL*
powerful
in
this
world
.
The
devil
will
hold
his
empire
over
humanity
*NL*
until
a
limit
of
time
which
is
still
unknown
.
You
laugh
?
You
do
not
*NL*
believe
in
the
devil
?
Scepticism
as
to
the
devil
is
a
French
idea
,
and
*NL*
it
is
also
a
frivolous
idea
.
Do
you
know
who
the
devil
is
?
Do
you
know
*NL*
his
name

Although
you
do
n't
know

you
make
a
mockery
of
his
*NL*
form
,
following
the
example
of
Voltaire

You
sneer
at
his
hoofs

at
*NL*
his
tail
,
at
his
horns
--
all
of
them
the
produce
of
your
imagination

In
*NL*
reality
the
devil
is
a
great
and
terrible
spirit

with
neither
*NL*
hoofs

horns
;
it
is
you
who
have
endowed
him
with
these

attributes

...
he

*NL*
*NL*
``
How

cried
Hippolyte
,
laughing
*NL*
hysterically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Another
excellent
idea
,
and
worth
considering
!
''
replied
Lebedeff
.
``
But
,
*NL*
again
,
that

not

The
question
at

eagerly

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

Undoubtedly
it

another
triumphantly

passes
on
with
an

well

even
in
the
act

carrying
bread

coldly
exclude
a
considerable
portion

from
*NL*
enjoying
it

that
has
been
seen
more
than
once

repeated
someone

*NL*
``
That

continued
Lebedeff

not
deigning
to

notice
the
interruption

``
Malthus

The

connected

for
I
am
obliged
to
relate

In

a
century
,
as
far
as
I
can
remember
;
once
in

every
twenty-five
years

I
wo
n't

to
this

the
exact

anyhow
they
have
become
comparatively
rare

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Comparatively
to
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
twelfth
century
,
and
those
immediately
preceding

following

it
.
We
are
told
by
historians
that
widespread
famines
occurred
in
those
*NL*
days
every
two
or
three
years
,
and
such
was
the
condition
of
things
that
*NL*
men
actually
had
recourse
to
cannibalism
,
in
secret
,
of
course
.
One
of
*NL*
these
cannibals
,
who
had
reached
a
good
age
,
declared
of
his
own
free
*NL*
will
that
during
the
course
of
his
long
and
miserable
life
he
had
*NL*
personally
killed
and
eaten
,
in
the
most
profound
secrecy
,
sixty
monks
,
*NL*
not
to
mention
several
children

the
number
of
the

he
thought
was
*NL*
about
six

an
insignificant
total
when
compared
with
the
enormous
mass
*NL*
of
ecclesiastics
consumed
by
him

As
to
adults

laymen
that
is
to

*NL*
he
had
never
touched
them

*NL*
*NL*
The

joined
in
the
general
outcry

*NL*
*NL*
``
That

impossible

said
he
in
an
aggrieved
tone

I
am
often

discussing

he

nonsense

no

``
General

the

And
you

I
assure
you

my

naked
truth

I
may
remark
that
reality
,
although
it
*NL*
is
governed
by
invariable
law
,
has
at
times
a
resemblance
to
falsehood

*NL*
In
fact
,
the
truer
a
thing
is
the
less
true
it
sounds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
could
anyone
possibly
eat
sixty
monks
?
''
objected
the
scoffing
*NL*
listeners
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
quite
clear
that
he
did
not
eat
them
all
at
once
,
but
in
a
*NL*
space
of
fifteen
or
twenty
years
:
from
that
point
of
view
the
thing
is
*NL*
comprehensible
and
natural
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Natural
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
natural
,
''
repeated
Lebedeff
with
pedantic
obstinacy
.
``
Besides
,
a
*NL*
Catholic
monk
is
by
nature
excessively
curious
;
it
would
be
quite
easy
*NL*
therefore
to
entice
him
into
a
wood
,
or
some
secret
place
,
on
false
*NL*
pretences
,
and
there
to
deal
with
him
as
said
.
But
I
do
not
dispute
in
*NL*
the
least
that
the
number
of
persons
consumed
appears
to
denote
a
spice
*NL*
of
greediness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
perhaps
true
,
gentlemen
,
''
said
the
prince
,
quietly
.
He
had
*NL*
been
listening
in
silence
up
to
that
moment
without
taking
part
in
the
*NL*
conversation
,
but
laughing
heartily
with
the
others
from
time
to
time
.
*NL*
Evidently
he
was
delighted
to
see
that
everybody
was
amused
,
that
*NL*
everybody
was
talking
at
once
,
and
even
that
everybody
was
drinking
.
*NL*
It
seemed
as
if
he
were
not
intending
to
speak
at
all
,
when
suddenly
*NL*
he
intervened
in
such
a
serious
voice
that
everyone
looked
at
him
with
*NL*
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
true
that
there
were
frequent
famines
at
that
time
,
gentlemen
.
*NL*
I
have
often
heard
of
them
,
though
I
do
not
know
much
history
.
But
it
*NL*
seems
to
me
that
it
must
have
been
so
.
When
I
was
in
Switzerland
I
used
*NL*
to
look
with
astonishment
at
the
many
ruins
of
feudal
castles
perched
*NL*
on
the
top
of
steep
and
rocky
heights
,
half
a
mile
at
least
above
*NL*
sea-level
,
so
that
to
reach
them
one
had
to
climb
many
miles
of
stony
*NL*
tracks
.
A
castle
,
as
you
know
,
is
,
a
kind
of
mountain
of
stones
--
a
*NL*
dreadful
,
almost
an
impossible
,
labour
!
Doubtless
the
builders
were
*NL*
all
poor
men
,
vassals
,
and
had
to
pay
heavy
taxes
,
and
to
keep
up
the
*NL*
priesthood
.
How
,
then
,
could
they
provide
for
themselves
,
and
when
*NL*
had
they
time
to
plough
and
sow
their
fields
?
The
greater
number
must
,
*NL*
literally
,
have
died
of
starvation
.
I
have
sometimes
asked
myself
how
*NL*
it
was
that
these
communities
were
not
utterly
swept
off
the
face
of
the
*NL*
earth
,
and
how
they
could
possibly
survive
.
Lebedeff
is
not
mistaken
,
*NL*
in
my
opinion
,
when
he
says
that
there
were
cannibals
in
those
days
,
*NL*
perhaps
in
considerable
numbers
;
but
I
do
not
understand
why
he
should
*NL*
have
dragged
in
the
monks
,
nor
what
he
means
by
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
undoubtedly
because
,
in
the
twelfth
century
,
monks
were
the
only
*NL*
people
one
could
eat
;
they
were
the
fat
,
among
many
lean
,
''
said
Gavrila
*NL*
Ardalionovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
brilliant
idea
,
and
most
true
!
''
cried
Lebedeff
,
``
for
he
never
*NL*
even
touched
the
laity
.
Sixty
monks
,
and
not
a
single
layman
!
It
is
a
*NL*
terrible
idea
,
but
it
is
historic
,
it
is
statistic
;
it
is
indeed
one
of
*NL*
those
facts
which
enables
an
intelligent
historian
to
reconstruct
the
*NL*
physiognomy
of
a
special
epoch
,
for
it
brings
out
this
further
point
*NL*
with
mathematical
accuracy
,
that
the
clergy
were
in
those
days
sixty
*NL*
times
richer
and
more
flourishing
than
the
rest
of
humanity
and
perhaps
*NL*
sixty
times
fatter
also
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
exaggerating
,
you
are
exaggerating
,
Lebedeff
!
''
cried
his
*NL*
hearers
,
amid
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
admit
that
it
is
an
historic
thought
,
but
what
is
your
conclusion
?
''
*NL*
asked
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
spoke
so
seriously
in
addressing
Lebedeff
,
that
his
tone
contrasted
*NL*
quite
comically
with
that
of
the
others
.
They
were
very
nearly
laughing
*NL*
at
him
,
too
,
but
he
did
not
notice
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
see
he
is
a
lunatic
,
prince
?
''
whispered
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
*NL*
in
his
ear
.
``
Someone
told
me
just
now
that
he
is
a
bit
touched
on
the
*NL*
subject
of
lawyers
,
that
he
has
a
mania
for
making
speeches
and
intends
*NL*
to
pass
the
examinations
.
I
am
expecting
a
splendid
burlesque
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
conclusion
is
vast
,
''
replied
Lebedeff
,
in
a
voice
like
thunder
.
``
Let
*NL*
us
examine
first
the
psychological
and
legal
position
of
the
criminal
.
*NL*
We
see
that
in
spite
of
the
difficulty
of
finding
other
food
,
the
*NL*
accused
,
or
,
as
we
may
say
,
my
client
,
has
often
during
his
peculiar
*NL*
life
exhibited
signs
of
repentance
,
and
of
wishing
to
give
up
this
*NL*
clerical
diet
.
Incontrovertible
facts
prove
this
assertion
.
He
has
eaten
*NL*
five
or
six
children
,
a
relatively
insignificant
number
,
no
doubt
,
*NL*
but
remarkable
enough
from
another
point
of
view
.
It
is
manifest
that
,
*NL*
pricked
by
remorse
--
for
my
client
is
religious
,
in
his
way
,
and
has
a
*NL*
conscience
,
as
I
shall
prove
later
--
and
desiring
to
extenuate
his
sin
*NL*
as
far
as
possible
,
he
has
tried
six
times
at
least
to
substitute
lay
*NL*
nourishment
for
clerical
.
That
this
was
merely
an
experiment
we
can
*NL*
hardly
doubt
:
for
if
it
had
been
only
a
question
of
gastronomic
variety
,
*NL*
six
would
have
been
too
few
;
why
only
six
?
Why
not
thirty
?
But
if
we
*NL*
regard
it
as
an
experiment
,
inspired
by
the
fear
of
committing
new
*NL*
sacrilege
,
then
this
number
six
becomes
intelligible
.
Six
attempts
*NL*
to
calm
his
remorse
,
and
the
pricking
of
his
conscience
,
would
amply
*NL*
suffice
,
for
these
attempts
could
scarcely
have
been
happy
ones
.
In
*NL*
my
humble
opinion
,
a
child
is
too
small
;
I
should
say
,
not
sufficient
;
*NL*
which
would
result
in
four
or
five
times
more
lay
children
than
monks
*NL*
being
required
in
a
given
time
.
The
sin
,
lessened
on
the
one
hand
,
would
*NL*
therefore
be
increased
on
the
other
,
in
quantity
,
not
in
quality
.
Please
*NL*
understand
,
gentlemen
,
that
in
reasoning
thus
,
I
am
taking
the
point
of
*NL*
view
which
might
have
been
taken
by
a
criminal
of
the
middle
ages
.
As
*NL*
for
myself
,
a
man
of
the
late
nineteenth
century
,
I
,
of
course
,
should
*NL*
reason
differently
;
I
say
so
plainly
,
and
therefore
you
need
not
jeer
*NL*
at
me
nor
mock
me
,
gentlemen
.
As
for
you
,
general
,
it
is
still
more
*NL*
unbecoming
on
your
part
.
In
the
second
place
,
and
giving
my
own
personal
*NL*
opinion
,
a
child
's
flesh
is
not
a
satisfying
diet
;
it
is
too
insipid
,
*NL*
too
sweet
;
and
the
criminal
,
in
making
these
experiments
,
could
have
*NL*
satisfied
neither
his
conscience
nor
his
appetite
.
I
am
about
to
*NL*
conclude
,
gentlemen
;
and
my
conclusion
contains
a
reply
to
one
of
the
*NL*
most
important
questions
of
that
day
and
of
our
own
!
This
criminal
ended
*NL*
at
last
by
denouncing
himself
to
the
clergy
,
and
giving
himself
up
to
*NL*
justice
.
We
can
not
but
ask
,
remembering
the
penal
system
of
that
day
,
*NL*
and
the
tortures
that
awaited
him
--
the
wheel
,
the
stake
,
the
fire
!
--
we
*NL*
can
not
but
ask
,
I
repeat
,
what
induced
him
to
accuse
himself
of
this
*NL*
crime
?
Why
did
he
not
simply
stop
short
at
the
number
sixty
,
and
keep
*NL*
his
secret
until
his
last
breath
?
Why
could
he
not
simply
leave
the
*NL*
monks
alone
,
and
go
into
the
desert
to
repent
?
Or
why
not
become
a
*NL*
monk
himself
?
That
is
where
the
puzzle
comes
in
!
There
must
have
been
*NL*
something
stronger
than
the
stake
or
the
fire
,
or
even
than
the
habits
*NL*
of
twenty
years
!
There
must
have
been
an
idea
more
powerful
than
all
*NL*
the
calamities
and
sorrows
of
this
world
,
famine
or
torture
,
leprosy
or
*NL*
plague
--
an
idea
which
entered
into
the
heart
,
directed
and
enlarged
the
*NL*
springs
of
life
,
and
made
even
that
hell
supportable
to
humanity
!
*NL*
Show
me
a
force
,
a
power
like
that
,
in
this
our
century
of
vices
*NL*
and
railways
!
I
might
say
,
perhaps
,
in
our
century
of
steamboats
and
*NL*
railways
,
but
I
repeat
in
our
century
of
vices
and
railways
,
because
I
*NL*
am
drunk
but
truthful
!
Show
me
a
single
idea
which
unites
men
nowadays
*NL*
with
half
the
strength
that
it
had
in
those
centuries
,
and
dare
to
*NL*
maintain
that
the
`
springs
of
life
'
have
not
been
polluted
and
weakened
*NL*
beneath
this
`
star
,
'
beneath
this
network
in
which
men
are
entangled
!
*NL*
Do
n't
talk
to
me
about
your
prosperity
,
your
riches
,
the
rarity
of
*NL*
famine
,
the
rapidity
of
the
means
of
transport
!
There
is
more
of
riches
,
*NL*
but
less
of
force
.
The
idea
uniting
heart
and
soul
to
heart
and
soul
*NL*
exists
no
more
.
All
is
loose
,
soft
,
limp
--
we
are
all
of
us
limp
...
*NL*
Enough
,
gentlemen
!
I
have
done
.
That
is
not
the
question
.
No
,
the
*NL*
question
is
now
,
excellency
,
I
believe
,
to
sit
down
to
the
banquet
you
*NL*
are
about
to
provide
for
us
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lebedeff
had
roused
great
indignation
in
some
of
his
auditors
-LRB-
it
*NL*
should
be
remarked
that
the
bottles
were
constantly
uncorked
during
his
*NL*
speech
-RRB-
;
but
this
unexpected
conclusion
calmed
even
the
most
turbulent
*NL*
spirits
.
``
That
's
how
a
clever
barrister
makes
a
good
point
!
''
said
he
,
*NL*
when
speaking
of
his
peroration
later
on
.
The
visitors
began
to
laugh
*NL*
and
chatter
once
again
;
the
committee
left
their
seats
,
and
stretched
*NL*
their
legs
on
the
terrace
.
Keller
alone
was
still
disgusted
with
*NL*
Lebedeff
and
his
speech
;
he
turned
from
one
to
another
,
saying
in
a
loud
*NL*
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
attacks
education
,
he
boasts
of
the
fanaticism
of
the
twelfth
*NL*
century
,
he
makes
absurd
grimaces
,
and
added
to
that
he
is
by
no
means
*NL*
the
innocent
he
makes
himself
out
to
be
.
How
did
he
get
the
money
to
buy
*NL*
this
house
,
allow
me
to
ask
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
another
corner
was
the
general
,
holding
forth
to
a
group
of
hearers
,
*NL*
among
them
Ptitsin
,
whom
he
had
buttonholed
.
``
I
have
known
,
''
said
he
,
*NL*
``
a
real
interpreter
of
the
Apocalypse
,
the
late
Gregory
Semeonovitch
*NL*
Burmistroff
,
and
he
--
he
pierced
the
heart
like
a
fiery
flash
!
He
began
*NL*
by
putting
on
his
spectacles
,
then
he
opened
a
large
black
book
;
*NL*
his
white
beard
,
and
his
two
medals
on
his
breast
,
recalling
acts
of
*NL*
charity
,
all
added
to
his
impressiveness
.
He
began
in
a
stern
voice
,
and
*NL*
before
him
generals
,
hard
men
of
the
world
,
bowed
down
,
and
ladies
*NL*
fell
to
the
ground
fainting
.
But
this
one
here
--
he
ends
by
announcing
a
*NL*
banquet
!
That
is
not
the
real
thing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ptitsin
listened
and
smiled
,
then
turned
as
if
to
get
his
hat
;
but
if
he
*NL*
had
intended
to
leave
,
he
changed
his
mind
.
Before
the
others
had
risen
*NL*
from
the
table
,
Gania
had
suddenly
left
off
drinking
,
and
pushed
away
*NL*
his
glass
,
a
dark
shadow
seemed
to
come
over
his
face
.
When
they
all
*NL*
rose
,
he
went
and
sat
down
by
Rogojin
.
It
might
have
been
believed
that
*NL*
quite
friendly
relations
existed
between
them
.
Rogojin
,
who
had
also
*NL*
seemed
on
the
point
of
going
away
now
sat
motionless
,
his
head
bent
,
*NL*
seeming
to
have
forgotten
his
intention
.
He
had
drunk
no
wine
,
and
*NL*
appeared
absorbed
in
reflection
.
From
time
to
time
he
raised
his
eyes
,
*NL*
and
examined
everyone
present
;
one
might
have
imagined
that
he
was
*NL*
expecting
something
very
important
to
himself
,
and
that
he
had
decided
*NL*
to
wait
for
it
.
The
prince
had
taken
two
or
three
glasses
of
champagne
,
*NL*
and
seemed
cheerful
.
As
he
rose
he
noticed
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
,
and
,
*NL*
remembering
the
appointment
he
had
made
with
him
,
smiled
pleasantly
.
*NL*
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
made
a
sign
with
his
head
towards
Hippolyte
,
whom
he
*NL*
was
attentively
watching
.
The
invalid
was
fast
asleep
,
stretched
out
on
*NL*
the
sofa
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
,
prince
,
why
on
earth
did
this
boy
intrude
himself
upon
you
?
''
*NL*
he
asked
,
with
such
annoyance
and
irritation
in
his
voice
that
the
*NL*
prince
was
quite
surprised
.
``
I
would
n't
mind
laying
odds
that
he
is
up
*NL*
to
some
mischief
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
observed
,
''
said
the
prince
,
``
that
he
seems
to
be
an
object
of
*NL*
very
singular
interest
to
you
,
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
.
Why
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
add
that
I
have
surely
enough
to
think
of
,
on
my
own
account
,
*NL*
without
him
;
and
therefore
it
is
all
the
more
surprising
that
I
can
not
*NL*
tear
my
eyes
and
thoughts
away
from
his
detestable
physiognomy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
come
!
He
has
a
handsome
face
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
look
at
him
--
look
at
him
now
!

*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
glanced
again
at
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
with
considerable
*NL*
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
V.
*NL*
*NL*
Hippolyte
,
who
had
fallen
asleep
during
Lebedeff
's
discourse
,
now
*NL*
suddenly
woke
up
,
just
as
though
someone
had
jogged
him
in
the
side
.
He
*NL*
shuddered
,
raised
himself
on
his
arm
,
gazed
around
,
and
grew
very
pale
.
*NL*
A
look
almost
of
terror
crossed
his
face
as
he
recollected
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
are
they
all
off
?
Is
it
all
over
?
Is
the
sun
up
?
''
He
trembled
,
*NL*
and
caught
at
the
prince
's
hand
.
``
What
time
is
it
?
Tell
me
,
quick
,
for
*NL*
goodness
'
sake
!
How
long
have
I
slept
?
''
he
added
,
almost
in
despair
,
*NL*
just
as
though
he
had
overslept
something
upon
which
his
whole
fate
*NL*
depended
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
slept
seven
or
perhaps
eight
minutes
,
''
said
Evgenie
*NL*
Pavlovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hippolyte
gazed
eagerly
at
the
latter
,
and
mused
for
a
few
moments
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
is
that
all
?
''
he
said
at
last
.
``
Then
I
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
drew
a
long
,
deep
breath
of
relief
,
as
it
seemed
.
He
realized
that
*NL*
all
was
not
over
as
yet
,
that
the
sun
had
not
risen
,
and
that
the
guests
*NL*
had
merely
gone
to
supper
.
He
smiled
,
and
two
hectic
spots
appeared
on
*NL*
his
cheeks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
counted
the
minutes
while
I
slept
,
did
you
,
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
?
''
*NL*
he
said
,
ironically
.
``
You
have
not
taken
your
eyes
off
me
all
the
*NL*
evening
--
I
have
noticed
that
much
,
you
see
!
Ah
,
Rogojin
!
I
've
just
*NL*
been
dreaming
about
him
,
prince

he
added
,
frowning
.
``
Yes
,
by
the
by
,
''
*NL*
starting
up
,
``
where
's
the
orator

Where
's
Lebedeff

Has
he
finished

*NL*
What
did
he
talk
about
?
Is
it
true
,
prince
,
that
you
once
declared
that
*NL*
`
beauty
would
save

world

Great
Heaven
!
The
prince
says
that
beauty
*NL*
saves
the
world

And
I
declare
that
he
only
has
such
playful
ideas
*NL*
because
he
's
in
love

Gentlemen
,
the
prince
is
in
love

I
guessed
it
the
*NL*
moment
he
came
in
.
Do
n't
blush
,
prince
;
you
make
me
sorry
for
you
.
What
*NL*
beauty
saves
the
world
?
Colia
told
me
that
you
are
a
zealous
Christian
;
*NL*
is
it
so
?
Colia
says
you
call
yourself
a
Christian

*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
regarded
him
attentively
,
but
said
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
answer
me

perhaps
you
think
I
am
very
fond

added
*NL*
Hippolyte
,
as
though
the
words
had
been
drawn
from
him

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

``
No

The
*NL*
prince
moved
the
glass
away

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
perhaps
you
're
right

said
Hippolyte

musing

There

you
've
given
me
your
*NL*
hand

you
must
feel
that
I
_
do

press
it
sincerely
,
do
n't
you
?
I
do
n't
*NL*
think
I
shall
drink
any
more

What
time
is
it
?
Never
mind
,
I
know
the
*NL*
time
.
The
time
has
come
,
at
all
events
.
What
!
they
are
laying
supper
*NL*
over
there

are
they

Then
this
table
is
free

Capital
,
gentlemen
!
*NL*
I
--
hem
!
these
gentlemen
are
not
listening

Prince
,
I
will
just
read
over
*NL*
an
article
I
have
here

Supper
is
more
interesting
,
of
course
,
but

''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Hippolyte
suddenly
,
and
most
unexpectedly
,
pulled
out
of
his
*NL*
breast-pocket
a
large
sealed
paper
.
This
imposing-looking
document
he
*NL*
placed
upon
the
table
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
effect
of
this
sudden
action
upon
the
company
was
instantaneous
.
*NL*
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
almost
bounded
off
his
chair
in
excitement
.
Rogojin
*NL*
drew
nearer
to
the
table
with
a
look
on
his
face
as
if
he
knew
what
was
*NL*
coming
.
Gania
came
nearer
too
;
so
did
Lebedeff
and
the
others
--
the
paper
*NL*
seemed
to
be
an
object
of
great
interest
to
the
company
in
general
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
you
got
there
?
''
asked
the
prince
,
with
some
anxiety
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
the
first
glimpse
of
the
rising
sun
,
prince
,
I
will
go
to
bed
.
I
*NL*
told
you
I
would
,
word
of
honour
!
You
shall
see
!
''
cried
Hippolyte
.
*NL*
``
You
think
I
'm
not
capable
of
opening
this
packet
,
do
you
?
''
He
glared
*NL*
defiantly
round
at
the
audience
in
general
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
observed
that
he
was
trembling
all
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
None
of
us
ever
thought
such
a
thing
!
''
Muishkin
replied
for
all
.
``
Why
*NL*
should
you
suppose
it
of
us
?
And
what
are
you
going
to
read
,
Hippolyte
?
*NL*
What
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
what
is
it
?
''
asked
others
.
The
packet
sealed
with
red
wax
seemed
*NL*
to
attract
everyone
,
as
though
it
were
a
magnet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wrote
this
yesterday
,
myself
,
just
after
I
saw
you
,
prince
,
and
told
*NL*
you
I
would
come
down
here
.
I
wrote
all
day
and
all
night
,
and
finished
*NL*
it
this
morning
early
.
Afterwards
I
had
a
dream
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Had
n't
we
better
hear
it
tomorrow
?
''
asked
the
prince
timidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tomorrow
`
there
will
be
no
more
time
!

''
laughed
Hippolyte
,
*NL*
hysterically
.
``
You
need
n't
be
afraid
;
I
shall
get
through
the
whole
*NL*
thing
in
forty
minutes
,
at
most
an
hour
!
Look
how
interested
everybody
*NL*
is
!
Everybody
has
drawn
near
.
Look
!
look
at
them
all
staring
at
my
*NL*
sealed
packet
!
If
I
had
n't
sealed
it
up
it
would
n't
have
been
half
so
*NL*
effective
!
Ha

that
's
mystery

that
is
!
Now
then
,
gentlemen

shall
*NL*
I
break
the
seal

not

Say
the
word
;
it
's
a
mystery
,
I
tell
you
--
a
*NL*
secret
!
Prince
,
you
know
who
said
there
would
be
`
no
more
time
'
?
It
was
*NL*
the
great
and
powerful
angel
in
the
Apocalypse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Better
not
read
it
now
,
''
said
the
prince
,
putting
his
hand
on
the
*NL*
packet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
do
n't
read
it
!
''
cried
Evgenie
suddenly
.
He
appeared
so
strangely
*NL*
disturbed
that
many
of
those
present
could
not
help
wondering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Reading
?
None
of
your
reading
now
!
''
said
somebody
;
``
it
's
supper-time
.
''
*NL*
``
What
sort
of
an
article
is
it
?
For
a
paper
?
Probably
it
's
very
*NL*
dull
,
''
said
another
.
But
the
prince
's
timid
gesture
had
impressed
even
*NL*
Hippolyte
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
'm
not
to
read
it
?
''
he
whispered
,
nervously
.
``
Am
I
not
to
read
*NL*
it
?
''
he
repeated
,
gazing
around
at
each
face
in
turn
.
``
What
are
you
*NL*
afraid
of
,
prince
?
''
he
turned
and
asked
the
latter
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
should
I
be
afraid
of
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
anyone
a
coin
about
them
?
Give
me
a
twenty-copeck
piece
,
somebody

*NL*
And
Hippolyte
leapt
from
his
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
you
are
,
''
said
Lebedeff
,
handing
him
one
;
he
thought
the
boy
had
*NL*
gone
mad
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Vera
Lukianovna
,
''
said
Hippolyte
,
``
toss
it
,
will
you
?
Heads
,
I
read
,
*NL*
tails
,
I
do
n't

''
*NL*
*NL*
Vera
Lebedeff
tossed
the
coin
into
the
air
and
let
it
fall
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
``
heads

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
read
it
,
''
said
Hippolyte
,
in
the
tone
of
one
bowing
to
the
fiat
*NL*
of
destiny
.
He
could
not
have
grown
paler
if
a
verdict
of
death
had
*NL*
suddenly
been
presented
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
after
all
,
what
is
it
?
Is
it
possible
that
I
should
have
just
*NL*
risked
my
fate
by
tossing
up
?
''
he
went
on
,
shuddering
;
and
looked
round
*NL*
him
again
.
His
eyes
had
a
curious
expression
of
sincerity
.
``
That
is
*NL*
an
astonishing
psychological
fact
,
''
he
cried
,
suddenly
addressing
*NL*
the
prince
,
in
a
tone
of
the
most
intense
surprise
.
``
It
is
...
it
*NL*
is
something
quite
inconceivable
,
prince
,
''
he
repeated
with
growing
*NL*
animation
,
like
a
man
regaining
consciousness
.
``
Take
note
of
it
,
*NL*
prince
,
remember
it
;
you
collect
,
I
am
told
,
facts
concerning
capital
*NL*
punishment
...
They
told
me
so
.
Ha
,
ha
!
My
God
,
how
absurd
!
''
He
sat
*NL*
down
on
the
sofa
,
put
his
elbows
on
the
table
,
and
laid
his
head
on
*NL*
his
hands
.
``
It
is
shameful
--
though
what
does
it
matter
to
me
if
it
is
*NL*
shameful
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
gentlemen
!
I
am
about
to
break
the
seal
,
''
he
continued
,
with
*NL*
determination
.
``
I
--
I
--
of
course
I
do
n't
insist
upon
anyone
listening
if
*NL*
they
do
not
wish
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
trembling
fingers
he
broke
the
seal
and
drew
out
several
sheets
of
*NL*
paper
,
smoothed
them
out
before
him
,
and
began
sorting
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
on
earth
does
all
this
mean
?
What
's
he
going
to
read
?
''
muttered
*NL*
several
voices
.
Others
said
nothing
;
but
one
and
all
sat
down
and
*NL*
watched
with
curiosity
.
They
began
to
think
something
strange
might
*NL*
really
be
about
to
happen
.
Vera
stood
and
trembled
behind
her
father
's
*NL*
chair
,
almost
in
tears
with
fright
;
Colia
was
nearly
as
much
alarmed
*NL*
as
she
was
.
Lebedeff
jumped
up
and
put
a
couple
of
candles
nearer
to
*NL*
Hippolyte
,
so
that
he
might
see
better
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
this
--
you
'll
soon
see
what
this
is
,
''
began
Hippolyte
,
and
*NL*
suddenly
commenced
his
reading
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It

A

beg
to
give

notice
that
all

very

only
a

*NL*
ideas
of
mine

in

*NL*
*NL*
``
Better

Gania
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Affectation

remarked
someone
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Too
much
talk

''
said
Rogojin
,
breaking
the
silence
for
the
first
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hippolyte
glanced
at
him
suddenly
,
and
when
their
eye
,
met
Rogojin
*NL*
showed
his
teeth
in
a
disagreeable
smile
,
and
said
the
following
strange
*NL*
words
:
``
That
's
not
the
way
to
settle
this
business
,
my
friend
;
that
's
*NL*
not
the
way
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
nobody
knew
what
Rogojin
meant
by
this
;
but
his
words
made
*NL*
a
deep
impression
upon
all
.
Everyone
seemed
to
see
in
a
flash
the
same
*NL*
idea
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Hippolyte
,
their
effect
upon
him
was
astounding
.
He
trembled
so
*NL*
that
the
prince
was
obliged
to
support
him
,
and
would
certainly
have
*NL*
cried
out
,
but
that
his
voice
seemed
to
have
entirely
left
him
for
the
*NL*
moment
.
For
a
minute
or
two
he
could
not
speak
at
all
,
but
panted
and
*NL*
stared
at
Rogojin
.
At
last
he
managed
to
ejaculate
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
it
was
_
you
_
who
came
--
_
you
_
--
_
you
?
_
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Came
where
?
What
do
you
mean

''
asked
Rogojin
,
amazed
.
But
Hippolyte
,
*NL*
panting
and
choking
with
excitement
,
interrupted
him
violently
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
You

came

me
last
week

o'clock

*NL*
``
Last

In

Have
you
gone

my
good

''
*NL*
*NL*
Hippolyte
paused
and
considered
a
moment
.
Then
a
smile
of
*NL*
cunning
--
almost
triumph
--
crossed
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
you
,
''
he
murmured
,
almost
in
a
whisper
,
but
with
absolute
*NL*
conviction
.
``
Yes
,
it
was
you
who
came
to
my
room
and
sat
silently
on
a
*NL*
chair
at
my
window
for
a
whole
hour
--
more
!
It
was
between
one
and
two
*NL*
at
night
;
you
rose
and
went
out
at
about
three
.
It
was
you
,
you
!
Why
you
*NL*
should
have
frightened
me
so
,
why
you
should
have
wished
to
torment
me
*NL*
like
that
,
I
can
not
tell

you
it
was

*NL*
*NL*
There
was
absolute
hatred
in
his
eyes
as
he
said
this
,
but
his
look
of
*NL*
fear
and
his
trembling
had
not
left
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
shall
hear
all
this
directly

gentlemen

I

listen

*NL*
*NL*
He
seized
his
paper
in
a
desperate
hurry
;
he
fidgeted
with
it
,
and
tried
*NL*
to
sort
it
,
but
for
a
long
while
his
trembling
hands
could
not
collect
*NL*
the
sheets
together
.
``
He
's
either
mad
or
delirious

murmured
Rogojin
.
*NL*
At
last
he
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
first
five
minutes
the
reader
's
voice
continued
to
tremble
,
*NL*
and
he
read
disconnectedly
and
unevenly
;
but
gradually
his
voice
*NL*
strengthened
.
Occasionally
a
violent
fit
of
coughing
stopped
him
,
but
*NL*
his
animation
grew
with
the
progress
of
the
reading
--
as
did
also
the
*NL*
disagreeable
impression
which
it
made
upon
his
audience
,
--
until
it
*NL*
reached
the
highest
pitch
of
excitement
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
is
the
article

*NL*
*NL*
MY
NECESSARY
EXPLANATION

''
_
Apres

_
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yesterday
morning
the
prince
came
to
see
me
.
Among
other
things
he
*NL*
asked
me
to
come
down
to
his
villa
.
I
knew
he
would
come
and
persuade
*NL*
me
to
this
step
,
and
that
he
would
adduce
the
argument
that
it
would
be
*NL*
easier
for
me
to
die
'
among
people
and
green
trees
,
'
--
as
he
expressed
*NL*
it
.
But
today
he
did
not
say
`
die
,
'
he
said
`
live
.
'
It
is
pretty
much
*NL*
the
same
to
me
,
in
my
position
,
which
he
says
.
When
I
asked
him
why
he
*NL*
made
such
a
point
of
his
`
green
trees
,
'
he
told
me
,
to
my
astonishment
,
*NL*
that
he
had
heard
that
last
time
I
was
in
Pavlofsk
I
had
said
that
I
had
*NL*
come
`
to
have
a
last
look
at
the
trees
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
observed
that
it
was
all
the
same
whether
one
died
among
trees
*NL*
or
in
front
of
a
blank
brick
wall
,
as
here
,
and
that
it
was
not
worth
*NL*
making
any
fuss
over
a
fortnight
,
he
agreed
at
once
.
But
he
insisted
*NL*
that
the
good
air
at
Pavlofsk
and
the
greenness
would
certainly
cause
a
*NL*
physical
change
for
the
better
,
and
that
my
excitement
,
and
my
_
dreams
_
,
*NL*
would
be
perhaps
relieved
.
I
remarked
to
him
,
with
a
smile
,
that
he
*NL*
spoke
like
a
materialist
,
and
he
answered
that
he
had
always
been
one
.
*NL*
As
he
never
tells
a
lie
,
there
must
be
something
in
his
words
.
His
smile
*NL*
is
a
pleasant
one
.
I
have
had
a
good
look
at
him
.
I
do
n't
know
whether
*NL*
I
like
him
or
not
;
and
I
have
no
time
to
waste
over
the
question
.
The
*NL*
hatred
which
I
felt
for
him
for
five
months
has
become
considerably
*NL*
modified
,
I
may
say
,
during
the
last
month
.
Who
knows
,
perhaps
I
am
*NL*
going
to
Pavlofsk
on
purpose
to
see
him
!
But
why
do
I
leave
my
chamber
?
*NL*
Those
who
are
sentenced
to
death
should
not
leave
their
cells
.
If
I
*NL*
had
not
formed
a
final
resolve
,
but
had
decided
to
wait
until
the
last
*NL*
minute
,
I
should
not
leave
my
room
,
or
accept
his
invitation
to
come
*NL*
and
die
at
Pavlofsk
.
I
must
be
quick
and
finish
this
explanation
before
*NL*
tomorrow
.
I
shall
have
no
time
to
read
it
over
and
correct
it
,
for
I
*NL*
must
read
it
tomorrow
to
the
prince
and
two
or
three
witnesses
whom
I
*NL*
shall
probably
find
there
.

*NL*
``
As
it
will
be
absolutely
true
,
without
a
touch
of
falsehood
,
I
am
*NL*
curious
to
see
what
impression
it
will
make
upon
me
myself
at
the
moment
*NL*
when
I
read
it
out
.
This
is
my
`
last
and
solemn
'
--
but
why
need
I
call
*NL*
it
that
?
There
is
no
question
about
the
truth
of
it
,
for
it
is
not
*NL*
worthwhile
lying
for
a
fortnight
;
a
fortnight
of
life
is
not
itself
*NL*
worth
having
,
which
is
a
proof
that
I
write
nothing
here
but
pure
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
``
N.B.
--
Let
me
remember
to
consider
;
am
I
mad
at
this
moment
,
or
not
?
or
*NL*
rather
at
these
moments
?
I
have
been
told
that
consumptives
sometimes
*NL*
do
go
out
of
their
minds
for
a
while
in
the
last
stages
of
the
malady
.
*NL*
I
can
prove
this
tomorrow
when
I
read
it
out
,
by
the
impression
it
*NL*
makes
upon
the
audience
.
I
must
settle
this
question
once
and
for
all
,
*NL*
otherwise
I
ca
n't
go
on
with
anything
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
I
have
just
written
dreadful
nonsense
;
but
there
's
no
time
*NL*
for
correcting
,
as
I
said
before
.
Besides
that
,
I
have
made
myself
a
*NL*
promise
not
to
alter
a
single
word
of
what
I
write
in
this
paper
,
even
*NL*
though
I
find
that
I
am
contradicting
myself
every
five
lines
.
I
wish
to
*NL*
verify
the
working
of
the
natural
logic
of
my
ideas
tomorrow
during
the
*NL*
reading
--
whether
I
am
capable
of
detecting
logical
errors
,
and
whether
*NL*
all
that
I
have
meditated
over
during
the
last
six
months
be
true
,
or
*NL*
nothing
but
delirium
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
two
months
since
I
had
been
called
upon
to
leave
my
room
and
the
*NL*
view
of
Meyer
's
wall
opposite
,
I
verily
believe
I
should
have
been
*NL*
sorry
.
But
now
I
have
no
such
feeling
,
and
yet
I
am
leaving
this
room
*NL*
and
Meyer
's
brick
wall
_
for
ever
_
.
So
that
my
conclusion
,
that
it
is
not
*NL*
worth
while
indulging
in
grief
,
or
any
other
emotion
,
for
a
fortnight
,
*NL*
has
proved
stronger
than
my
very
nature
,
and
has
taken
over
the
*NL*
direction
of
my
feelings
.
But
is
it
so
?
Is
it
the
case
that
my
nature
*NL*
is
conquered
entirely
?
If
I
were
to
be
put
on
the
rack
now
,
I
should
*NL*
certainly
cry
out
.
I
should
not
say
that
it
is
not
worth
while
to
yell
*NL*
and
feel
pain
because
I
have
but
a
fortnight
to
live
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
is
it
true
that
I
have
but
a
fortnight
of
life
left
to
me
?
I
know
I
*NL*
told
some
of
my
friends
that
Doctor
B.
had
informed
me
that
this
was
the
*NL*
case
;
but
I
now
confess
that
I
lied
;
B.
has
not
even
seen
me
.
However
,
*NL*
a
week
ago
,
I
called
in
a
medical
student
,
Kislorodoff
,
who
is
a
*NL*
Nationalist
,
an
Atheist
,
and
a
Nihilist
,
by
conviction
,
and
that
is
why
*NL*
I
had
him
.
I
needed
a
man
who
would
tell
me
the
bare
truth
without
any
*NL*
humbug
or
ceremony
--
and
so
he
did
--
indeed
,
almost
with
pleasure
-LRB-
which
I
*NL*
thought
was
going
a
little
too
far
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
he
plumped
out
that
I
had
about
a
month
left
me
;
it
might
be
a
*NL*
little
more
,
he
said
,
under
favourable
circumstances
,
but
it
might
*NL*
also
be
considerably
less
.
According
to
his
opinion
I
might
die
quite
*NL*
suddenly
--
tomorrow
,
for
instance
--
there
had
been
such
cases
.
Only
a
day
*NL*
or
two
since
a
young
lady
at
Colomna
who
suffered
from
consumption
,
and
*NL*
was
about
on
a
par
with
myself
in
the
march
of
the
disease
,
was
going
*NL*
out
to
market
to
buy
provisions
,
when
she
suddenly
felt
faint
,
lay
down
*NL*
on
the
sofa
,
gasped
once
,
and
died
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kislorodoff
told
me
all
this
with
a
sort
of
exaggerated
devil-may-care
*NL*
negligence
,
and
as
though
he
did
me
great
honour
by
talking
to
me
*NL*
so
,
because
it
showed
that
he
considered
me
the
same
sort
of
exalted
*NL*
Nihilistic
being
as
himself
,
to
whom
death
was
a
matter
of
no
*NL*
consequence
whatever
,
either
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
all
events
,
the
fact
remained
--
a
month
of
life
and
no
more
!
That
he
*NL*
is
right
in
his
estimation
I
am
absolutely
persuaded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
puzzles
me
much
to
think
how
on
earth
the
prince
guessed
yesterday
*NL*
that
I
have
had
bad
dreams
.
He
said
to
me
,
`
Your
excitement
and
dreams
*NL*
will
find
relief
at
Pavlofsk
.
'
Why
did
he
say
`
dreams
'
?
Either
he
is
a
*NL*
doctor
,
or
else
he
is
a
man
of
exceptional
intelligence
and
wonderful
*NL*
powers
of
observation
.
-LRB-
But
that
he
is
an
`
idiot
,
'
at
bottom
there
can
*NL*
be
no
doubt
whatever
.
-RRB-
It
so
happened
that
just
before
he
arrived
I
had
*NL*
a
delightful
little
dream
;
one
of
a
kind
that
I
have
hundreds
of
just
*NL*
now
.
I
had
fallen
asleep
about
an
hour
before
he
came
in
,
and
dreamed
*NL*
that
I
was
in
some
room
,
not
my
own
.
It
was
a
large
room
,
well
*NL*
furnished
,
with
a
cupboard
,
chest
of
drawers
,
sofa
,
and
my
bed
,
a
fine
*NL*
wide
bed
covered
with
a
silken
counterpane
.
But
I
observed
in
the
room
*NL*
a
dreadful-looking
creature
,
a
sort
of
monster
.
It
was
a
little
like
a
*NL*
scorpion
,
but
was
not
a
scorpion
,
but
far
more
horrible
,
and
especially
*NL*
so
,
because
there
are
no
creatures
anything
like
it
in
nature
,
and
*NL*
because
it
had
appeared
to
me
for
a
purpose
,
and
bore
some
mysterious
*NL*
signification
.
I
looked
at
the
beast
well
;
it
was
brown
in
colour
and
*NL*
had
a
shell
;
it
was
a
crawling
kind
of
reptile
,
about
eight
inches
long
,
*NL*
and
narrowed
down
from
the
head
,
which
was
about
a
couple
of
fingers
in
*NL*
width
,
to
the
end
of
the
tail
,
which
came
to
a
fine
point
.
Out
of
its
*NL*
trunk
,
about
a
couple
of
inches
below
its
head
,
came
two
legs
at
an
*NL*
angle
of
forty-five
degrees
,
each
about
three
inches
long
,
so
that
the
*NL*
beast
looked
like
a
trident
from
above
.
It
had
eight
hard
needle-like
*NL*
whiskers
coming
out
from
different
parts
of
its
body
;
it
went
along
like
*NL*
a
snake
,
bending
its
body
about
in
spite
of
the
shell
it
wore
,
and
its
*NL*
motion
was
very
quick
and
very
horrible
to
look
at
.
I
was
dreadfully
*NL*
afraid
it
would
sting
me
;
somebody
had
told
me
,
I
thought
,
that
it
*NL*
was
venomous
;
but
what
tormented
me
most
of
all
was
the
wondering
and
*NL*
wondering
as
to
who
had
sent
it
into
my
room
,
and
what
was
the
mystery
*NL*
which
I
felt
it
contained
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
hid
itself
under
the
cupboard
and
under
the
chest
of
drawers
,
and
*NL*
crawled
into
the
corners
.
I
sat
on
a
chair
and
kept
my
legs
tucked
*NL*
under
me
.
Then
the
beast
crawled
quietly
across
the
room
and
disappeared
*NL*
somewhere
near
my
chair
.
I
looked
about
for
it
in
terror
,
but
I
still
*NL*
hoped
that
as
my
feet
were
safely
tucked
away
it
would
not
be
able
to
*NL*
touch
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Suddenly
I
heard
behind
me
,
and
about
on
a
level
with
my
head
,
a
sort
*NL*
of
rattling
sound
.
I
turned
sharp
round
and
saw
that
the
brute
had
*NL*
crawled
up
the
wall
as
high
as
the
level
of
my
face
,
and
that
its
*NL*
horrible
tail
,
which
was
moving
incredibly
fast
from
side
to
side
,
was
*NL*
actually
touching
my
hair
!
I
jumped
up
--
and
it
disappeared
.
I
did
not
*NL*
dare
lie
down
on
my
bed
for
fear
it
should
creep
under
my
pillow
.
My
*NL*
mother
came
into
the
room
,
and
some
friends
of
hers
.
They
began
to
hunt
*NL*
for
the
reptile
and
were
more
composed
than
I
was
;
they
did
not
seem
to
*NL*
be
afraid
of
it
.
But
they
did
not
understand
as
I
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Suddenly
the
monster
reappeared
;
it
crawled
slowly
across
the
room
and
*NL*
made
for
the
door
,
as
though
with
some
fixed
intention
,
and
with
a
slow
*NL*
movement
that
was
more
horrible
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
my
mother
opened
the
door
and
called
my
dog
,
Norma
.
Norma
was
a
*NL*
great
Newfoundland
,
and
died
five
years
ago
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
sprang
forward
and
stood
still
in
front
of
the
reptile
as
if
she
*NL*
had
been
turned
to
stone
.
The
beast
stopped
too
,
but
its
tail
and
*NL*
claws
still
moved
about
.
I
believe
animals
are
incapable
of
feeling
*NL*
supernatural
fright
--
if
I
have
been
rightly
informed
,
--
but
at
this
*NL*
moment
there
appeared
to
me
to
be
something
more
than
ordinary
about
*NL*
Norma
's
terror
,
as
though
it
must
be
supernatural
;
and
as
though
she
*NL*
felt
,
just
as
I
did
myself
,
that
this
reptile
was
connected
with
some
*NL*
mysterious
secret
,
some
fatal
omen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Norma
backed
slowly
and
carefully
away
from
the
brute
,
which
followed
*NL*
her
,
creeping
deliberately
after
her
as
though
it
intended
to
make
a
*NL*
sudden
dart
and
sting
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
spite
of
Norma
's
terror
she
looked
furious
,
though
she
trembled
in
*NL*
all
her
limbs
.
At
length
she
slowly
bared
her
terrible
teeth
,
opened
*NL*
her
great
red
jaws
,
hesitated
--
took
courage
,
and
seized
the
beast
in
her
*NL*
mouth
.
It
seemed
to
try
to
dart
out
of
her
jaws
twice
,
but
Norma
caught
*NL*
at
it
and
half
swallowed
it
as
it
was
escaping
.
The
shell
cracked
in
her
*NL*
teeth
;
and
the
tail
and
legs
stuck
out
of
her
mouth
and
shook
about
in
*NL*
a
horrible
manner
.
Suddenly
Norma
gave
a
piteous
whine
;
the
reptile
had
*NL*
bitten
her
tongue
.
She
opened
her
mouth
wide
with
the
pain
,
and
I
saw
*NL*
the
beast
lying
across
her
tongue
,
and
out
of
its
body
,
which
was
almost
*NL*
bitten
in
two
,
came
a
hideous
white-looking
substance
,
oozing
out
into
*NL*
Norma
's
mouth
;
it
was
of
the
consistency
of
a
crushed
black-beetle
just
*NL*
then
I
awoke
and
the
prince
entered
the
room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen

said
Hippolyte
,
breaking
off
here
,
``
I
have
not
done

As

his

wore

he
wiped

sweat
off
his

Ferdishenko
suddenly

*NL*
Hippolyte
clutched
his
manuscript
,
and
gazing
at
the
last
speaker
with
*NL*
glittering
eyes
,
said
:
``
You
do
n't
like

A
few
laughed
at
*NL*
this
,
but
not
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hippolyte

said
the
prince
,
``

*NL*
``
How

cried
Hippolyte
,
looking
at
him
in
amazement

*NL*
``

wo
n't

off
again

*NL*
*NL*
He
gulped
down
some
water
out
of
a
glass
standing
near
,
bent
over
the
*NL*
table
,
in
order
to
hide
his
face
from
the
audience

and
recommenced
.

*NL*
``
The
idea
that
it
is
not
worth
while
living
for
a
few
weeks
took
*NL*
possession
of
me
a
month
ago
,
when
I
was
told
that
I
had
four
weeks
to
*NL*
live
,
but
only
partially
so
at
that
time
.
The
idea
quite
overmastered
me
*NL*
three
days
since
,
that
evening
at
Pavlofsk
.
The
first
time
that
I
felt
*NL*
really
impressed
with
this
thought
was
on
the
terrace
at
the
prince
's
,
*NL*
at
the
very
moment
when
I
had
taken
it
into
my
head
to
make
a
last
trial
*NL*
of
life
.
I
wanted
to
see
people
and
trees
-LRB-
I
believe
I
said
so
myself
-RRB-
,
*NL*
I
got
excited
,
I
maintained
Burdovsky
's
rights

`
my
neighbour

I
*NL*
dreamt
that
one
and
all
would
open
their
arms
,
and
embrace
me
,
that
*NL*
there
would
be
an
indescribable
exchange
of
forgiveness
between
us
all
!
*NL*
In
a
word
,
I
behaved
like
a
fool
,
and
then
,
at
that
very
same
instant
,
I
*NL*
felt
my
`
last
conviction
.
'
I
ask
myself
now
how
I
could
have
waited
six
*NL*
months
for
that
conviction
!
I
knew
that
I
had
a
disease
that
spares
*NL*
no
one
,
and
I
really
had
no
illusions
;
but
the
more
I
realized
my
*NL*
condition
,
the
more
I
clung
to
life
;
I
wanted
to
live
at
any
price
.
I
*NL*
confess
I
might
well
have
resented
that
blind
,
deaf
fate
,
which
,
with
no
*NL*
apparent
reason
,
seemed
to
have
decided
to
crush
me
like
a
fly
;
but
why
*NL*
did
I
not
stop
at
resentment
?
Why
did
I
begin
to
live
,
knowing
that
it
*NL*
was
not
worthwhile
to
begin
?
Why
did
I
attempt
to
do
what
I
knew
to
be
*NL*
an
impossibility
?
And
yet
I
could
not
even
read
a
book
to
the
end
;
I
*NL*
had
given
up
reading
.
What
is
the
good
of
reading
,
what
is
the
good
of
*NL*
learning
anything
,
for
just
six
months
?
That
thought
has
made
me
throw
*NL*
aside
a
book
more
than
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
wall
of
Meyer
's
could
tell
a
tale
if
it
liked
.
There
was
no
*NL*
spot
on
its
dirty
surface
that
I
did
not
know
by
heart
.
Accursed
wall
!
*NL*
and
yet
it
is
dearer
to
me
than
all
the
Pavlofsk
trees
!
--
That
is
--
it
*NL*
_
would
_
be
dearer
if
it
were
not
all
the
same
to
me
,
now

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
remember
now
with
what
hungry
interest
I
began
to
watch
the
lives
of
*NL*
other
people
--
interest
that
I
had
never
felt
before
!
I
used
to
wait
for
*NL*
Colia
's
arrival
impatiently
,
for
I
was
so
ill
myself
,
then
,
that
I
could
*NL*
not
leave
the
house
.
I
so
threw
myself
into
every
little
detail
of
news
,
*NL*
and
took
so
much
interest
in
every
report
and
rumour
,
that
I
believe
I
*NL*
became
a
regular
gossip
!
I
could
not
understand
,
among
other
things
,
how
*NL*
all
these
people
--
with
so
much
life
in
and
before
them
--
do
not
become
*NL*
_
rich
_
--
and
I
do
n't
understand
it
now
.
I
remember
being
told
of
a
poor
*NL*
wretch
I
once
knew
,
who
had
died
of
hunger
.
I
was
almost
beside
myself
*NL*
with
rage
!
I
believe
if
I
could
have
resuscitated
him
I
would
have
done
*NL*
so
for
the
sole
purpose
of
murdering
him
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Occasionally
I
was
so
much
better
that
I
could
go
out
;
but
the
streets
*NL*
used
to
put
me
in
such
a
rage
that
I
would
lock
myself
up
for
days
*NL*
rather
than
go
out
,
even
if
I
were
well
enough
to
do
so
!
I
could
*NL*
not
bear
to
see
all
those
preoccupied
,
anxious-looking
creatures
*NL*
continuously
surging
along
the
streets
past
me
!
Why
are
they
always
*NL*
anxious
?
What
is
the
meaning
of
their
eternal
care
and
worry
?
It
is
*NL*
their
wickedness
,
their
perpetual
detestable
malice
--
that
's
what
it
*NL*
is
--
they
are
all
full
of
malice

malice

*NL*
*NL*
``
Whose
fault
is
it
that
they
are
all
miserable
,
that
they
do
n't
know
how
*NL*
to
live
,
though
they
have
fifty
or
sixty
years
of
life
before
them
?
Why
*NL*
did
that
fool
allow
himself
to
die
of
hunger
with
sixty
years
of
unlived
*NL*
life
before
him

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
everyone
of

shows
his

in

his
wrath

Here
are
we

working

cattle
all
our

always
*NL*
as

side

along
some

no

dying

no

at

threw
the

still

may
be
perfectly

Columbus
was
happy

it
was
not
after

*NL*

discovered
America

when

was

You
may
be
quite
*NL*
sure

reached
the
culminating
point
of
his
happiness
three
days

before
he
saw
the
New
World
with
his
actual
eyes
,
when
his
mutinous
*NL*
sailors
wanted
to
tack
about

return

What
did
the
New
*NL*
World
matter
after
all

Columbus
had
hardly
seen
it
when
he
died
,
and
*NL*
in
reality
he
was
entirely
ignorant
of
what
he
had
discovered

important

A
word
as
to
my
circumstances
.
When
,
eight
months
since
,
I
became
*NL*
very
ill
,
I
threw
up
all
my
old
connections
and
dropped
all
my
old
*NL*
companions
.
As
I
was
always
a
gloomy
,
morose
sort
of
individual
,
my
*NL*
friends
easily
forgot
me
;
of
course
,
they
would
have
forgotten
me
all
*NL*
the
same
,
without
that
excuse
.
My
position
at
home
was
solitary
enough
.
*NL*
Five
months
ago
I
separated
myself
entirely
from
the
family
,
and
no
one
*NL*
dared
enter
my
room
except
at
stated
times
,
to
clean
and
tidy
it
,
and
so
*NL*
on
,
and
to
bring
me
my
meals
.
My
mother
dared
not
disobey
me
;
she
kept
*NL*
the
children
quiet
,
for
my
sake
,
and
beat
them
if
they
dared
to
make
any
*NL*
noise
and
disturb
me
.
I
so
often
complained
of
them
that
I
should
think
*NL*
they
must
be
very
fond
,
indeed
,
of
me
by
this
time
.
I
think
I
must
have
*NL*
tormented
`
my
faithful
Colia
'
-LRB-
as
I
called
him
-RRB-
a
good
deal
too
.
He
*NL*
tormented
me
of
late
;
I
could
see
that
he
always
bore
my
tempers
as
*NL*
though
he
had
determined
to
`
spare
the
poor
invalid
.
'
This
annoyed
*NL*
me
,
naturally
.
He
seemed
to
have
taken
it
into
his
head
to
imitate
the
*NL*
prince
in
Christian
meekness
!
Surikoff
,
who
lived
above
us
,
annoyed
me
,
*NL*
too
.
He
was
so
miserably
poor
,
and
I
used
to
prove
to
him
that
he
had
no
*NL*
one
to
blame
but
himself
for
his
poverty
.
I
used
to
be
so
angry
that
I
*NL*
think
I
frightened
him
eventually
,
for
he
stopped
coming
to
see
me
.
He
*NL*
was
a
most
meek
and
humble
fellow
,
was
Surikoff
.
-LRB-
N.B.
--
They
say
that
*NL*
meekness
is
a
great
power
.
I
must
ask
the
prince
about
this
,
for
the
*NL*
expression
is
his
.
-RRB-
But
I
remember
one
day
in
March
,
when
I
went
up
to
*NL*
his
lodgings
to
see
whether
it
was
true
that
one
of
his
children
had
*NL*
been
starved
and
frozen
to
death
,
I
began
to
hold
forth
to
him
about
*NL*
his
poverty
being
his
own
fault
,
and
,
in
the
course
of
my
remarks
,
I
*NL*
accidentally
smiled
at
the
corpse
of
his
child
.
Well
,
the
poor
wretch
's
*NL*
lips
began
to
tremble
,
and
he
caught
me
by
the
shoulder
,
and
pushed
me
*NL*
to
the
door
.
`
Go
out
,
'
he
said
,
in
a
whisper
.
I
went
out
,
of
course
,
and
*NL*
I
declare
I
_
liked
_
it
.
I
liked
it
at
the
very
moment
when
I
was
*NL*
turned
out
.
But
his
words
filled
me
with
a
strange
sort
of
feeling
of
*NL*
disdainful
pity
for
him
whenever
I
thought
of
them
--
a
feeling
which
*NL*
I
did
not
in
the
least
desire
to
entertain
.
At
the
very
moment
of
the
*NL*
insult
-LRB-
for
I
admit
that
I
did
insult
him
,
though
I
did
not
mean
to
-RRB-
,
*NL*
this
man
could
not
lose
his
temper
.
His
lips
had
trembled
,
but
I
swear
*NL*
it
was
not
with
rage
.
He
had
taken
me
by
the
arm
,
and
said
,
`
Go
out
,
'
*NL*
without
the
least
anger
.
There
was
dignity
,
a
great
deal
of
dignity
,
*NL*
about
him
,
and
it
was
so
inconsistent
with
the
look
of
him
that
,
I
*NL*
assure
you
,
it
was
quite
comical
.
But
there
was
no
anger
.
Perhaps
he
*NL*
merely
began
to
despise
me
at
that
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Since
that
time
he
has
always
taken
off
his
hat
to
me
on
the
stairs
,
*NL*
whenever
I
met
him
,
which
is
a
thing
he
never
did
before
;
but
he
always
*NL*
gets
away
from
me
as
quickly
as
he
can
,
as
though
he
felt
confused
.
If
*NL*
he
did
despise
me
,
he
despised
me
`
meekly
,
'
after
his
own
fashion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dare
say
he
only
took
his
hat
off
out

fear

it
were

the
son
*NL*
of
his
creditor
;
for
he
always
owed
my
mother
money
.
I
thought
of
having
*NL*
an
explanation
with
him
,
but
I
knew
that
if
I
did
,
he
would
begin
to
*NL*
apologize
in
a
minute
or
two
,
so
I
decided
to
let
him
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
about
that
time
,
that
is
,
the
middle
of
March
,
I
suddenly
felt
*NL*
very
much
better
;
this
continued
for
a
couple
of
weeks
.
I
used
to
go
*NL*
out
at
dusk
.
I
like
the
dusk
,
especially
in
March
,
when
the
night
frost
*NL*
begins
to
harden
the
day
's
puddles
,
and
the
gas
is
burning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
one
night
in
the
Shestilavochnaya
,
a
man
passed
me
with
a
paper
*NL*
parcel
under
his
arm
.
I
did
not
take
stock
of
him
very
carefully
,
but
he
*NL*
seemed
to
be
dressed
in
some
shabby
summer
dust-coat
,
much
too
light
for
*NL*
the
season
.
When
he
was
opposite
the
lamp-post
,
some
ten
yards
away
,
I
*NL*
observed
something
fall
out
of
his
pocket
.
I
hurried
forward
to
pick
it
*NL*
up
,
just
in
time
,
for
an
old
wretch
in
a
long
kaftan
rushed
up
too
.
*NL*
He
did
not
dispute
the
matter
,
but
glanced
at
what
was
in
my
hand
and
*NL*
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a
large
old-fashioned
pocket-book
,
stuffed
full
;
but
I
guessed
,
*NL*
at
a
glance
,
that
it
had
anything
in
the
world
inside
it
,
except
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
owner
was
now
some
forty
yards
ahead
of
me
,
and
was
very
soon
lost
*NL*
in
the
crowd
.
I
ran
after
him
,
and
began
calling
out
;
but
as
I
knew
*NL*
nothing
to
say
excepting
`
hey
!
'
he
did
not
turn
round
.
Suddenly
he
*NL*
turned
into
the
gate
of
a
house
to
the
left
;
and
when
I
darted
in
after
*NL*
him
,
the
gateway
was
so
dark
that
I
could
see
nothing
whatever
.
It
was
*NL*
one
of
those
large
houses
built
in
small
tenements
,
of
which
there
must
*NL*
have
been
at
least
a
hundred
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
entered
the
yard
I
thought
I
saw
a
man
going
along
on
the
far
*NL*
side
of
it
;
but
it
was
so
dark
I
could
not
make
out
his
figure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
crossed
to
that
corner
and
found
a
dirty
dark
staircase
.
I
heard
a
*NL*
man
mounting
up
above
me
,
some
way
higher
than
I
was
,
and
thinking
I
*NL*
should
catch
him
before
his
door
would
be
opened
to
him
,
I
rushed
after
*NL*
him
.
I
heard
a
door
open
and
shut
on
the
fifth
storey
,
as
I
panted
*NL*
along
;
the
stairs
were
narrow
,
and
the
steps
innumerable
,
but
at
last
I
*NL*
reached
the
door
I
thought
the
right
one
.
Some
moments
passed
before
I
*NL*
found
the
bell
and
got
it
to
ring
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
old
peasant
woman
opened
the
door
;
she
was
busy
lighting
the
*NL*
`
samovar
'
in
a
tiny
kitchen
.
She
listened
silently
to
my
questions
,
did
*NL*
not
understand
a
word
,
of
course
,
and
opened
another
door
leading
into
*NL*
a
little
bit
of
a
room
,
low
and
scarcely
furnished
at
all
,
but
with
*NL*
a
large
,
wide
bed
in
it
,
hung
with
curtains
.
On
this
bed
lay
one
*NL*
Terentich
,
as
the
woman
called
him
,
drunk
,
it
appeared
to
me
.
On
the
*NL*
table
was
an
end
of
candle
in
an
iron
candlestick
,
and
a
half-bottle
of
*NL*
vodka
,
nearly
finished
.
Terentich
muttered
something
to
me
,
and
signed
*NL*
towards
the
next
room
.
The
old
woman
had
disappeared
,
so
there
was
*NL*
nothing
for
me
to
do
but
to
open
the
door
indicated
.
I
did
so
,
and
*NL*
entered
the
next
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
was
still
smaller
than
the
other
,
so
cramped
that
I
could
scarcely
*NL*
turn
round
;
a
narrow
single
bed
at
one
side
took
up
nearly
all
the
room
.
*NL*
Besides
the
bed
there
were
only
three
common
chairs
,
and
a
wretched
old
*NL*
kitchen-table
standing
before
a
small
sofa
.
One
could
hardly
squeeze
*NL*
through
between
the
table
and
the
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
table
,
as
in
the
other
room
,
burned
a
tallow
candle-end
in
an
*NL*
iron
candlestick
;
and
on
the
bed
there
whined
a
baby
of
scarcely
three
*NL*
weeks
old
.
A
pale-looking
woman
was
dressing
the
child
,
probably
the
*NL*
mother
;
she
looked
as
though
she
had
not
as
yet
got
over
the
trouble
of
*NL*
childbirth
,
she
seemed
so
weak
and
was
so
carelessly
dressed
.
Another
*NL*
child
,
a
little
girl
of
about
three
years
old
,
lay
on
the
sofa
,
covered
*NL*
over
with
what
looked
like
a
man
's
old
dress-coat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
the
table
stood
a
man
in
his
shirt
sleeves
;
he
had
thrown
off
his
*NL*
coat
;
it
lay
upon
the
bed
;
and
he
was
unfolding
a
blue
paper
parcel
in
*NL*
which
were
a
couple
of
pounds
of
bread
,
and
some
little
sausages
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
table
along
with
these
things
were
a
few
old
bits
of
black
*NL*
bread
,
and
some
tea
in
a
pot
.
From
under
the
bed
there
protruded
an
*NL*
open
portmanteau
full
of
bundles
of
rags
.
In
a
word
,
the
confusion
and
*NL*
untidiness
of
the
room
were
indescribable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
appeared
to
me
,
at
the
first
glance
,
that
both
the
man
and
the
woman
*NL*
were
respectable
people
,
but
brought
to
that
pitch
of
poverty
where
*NL*
untidiness
seems
to
get
the
better
of
every
effort
to
cope
with
it
,
till
*NL*
at
last
they
take
a
sort
of
bitter
satisfaction
in
it
.
When
I
entered
*NL*
the
room
,
the
man
,
who
had
entered
but
a
moment
before
me
,
and
was
still
*NL*
unpacking
his
parcels
,
was
saying
something
to
his
wife
in
an
excited
*NL*
manner
.
The
news
was
apparently
bad
,
as
usual
,
for
the
woman
began
*NL*
whimpering
.
The
man
's
face
seemed
to
me
to
be
refined
and
even
pleasant
.
*NL*
He
was
dark-complexioned
,
and
about
twenty-eight
years
of
age
;
he
wore
*NL*
black
whiskers
,
and
his
lip
and
chin
were
shaved
.
He
looked
morose
,
but
*NL*
with
a
sort
of
pride
of
expression
.
A
curious
scene
followed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
people
who
find
satisfaction
in
their
own
touchy
feelings
,
*NL*
especially
when
they
have
just
taken
the
deepest
offence
;
at
such
*NL*
moments
they
feel
that
they
would
rather
be
offended
than
not
.
These
*NL*
easily-ignited
natures
,
if
they
are
wise
,
are
always
full
of
remorse
*NL*
afterwards
,
when
they
reflect
that
they
have
been
ten
times
as
angry
as
*NL*
they
need
have
been
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
gentleman
before
me
gazed
at
me
for
some
seconds
in
amazement
,
*NL*
and
his
wife
in
terror
;
as
though
there
was
something
alarmingly
*NL*
extraordinary
in
the
fact
that
anyone
could
come
to
see
them
.
But
*NL*
suddenly
he
fell
upon
me
almost
with
fury
;
I
had
had
no
time
to
mutter
*NL*
more
than
a
couple
of
words
;
but
he
had
doubtless
observed
that
I
was
*NL*
decently
dressed
and
,
therefore
,
took
deep
offence
because
I
had
dared
*NL*
enter
his
den
so
unceremoniously
,
and
spy
out
the
squalor
and
untidiness
*NL*
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
he
was
delighted
to
get
hold
of
someone
upon
whom
to
vent
his
*NL*
rage
against
things
in
general
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
a
moment
I
thought
he
would
assault
me
;
he
grew
so
pale
that
he
*NL*
looked
like
a
woman
about
to
have
hysterics
;
his
wife
was
dreadfully
*NL*
alarmed
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
How
dare
you
come
in
so
?
Be
off
!
'
he
shouted
,
trembling
all
over
with
*NL*
rage
and
scarcely
able
to
articulate
the
words
.
Suddenly
,
however
,
he
*NL*
observed
his
pocketbook
in
my
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'
I
think
you
dropped
this
,

I
remarked
,
as
quietly
and
drily
as
I
*NL*
could
.
-LRB-
I
thought
it
best
to
treat
him
so
.
-RRB-
For
some
while
he
stood
*NL*
before
me
in
downright
terror
,
and
seemed
unable
to
understand
.
He
then
*NL*
suddenly
grabbed
at
his
side-pocket
,
opened
his
mouth
in
alarm
,
and
beat
*NL*
his
forehead
with
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
My
God
!
'
he
cried
,
`
where
did
you
find
it
?
How
?
'
I
explained
in
as
few
*NL*
words
as
I
could
,
and
as
drily
as
possible
,
how
I
had
seen
it
and
picked
*NL*
it
up
;
how
I
had
run
after
him
,
and
called
out
to
him
,
and
how
I
had
*NL*
followed
him
upstairs
and
groped
my
way
to
his
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Gracious
Heaven
!
'
he
cried
,
`
all
our
papers
are
in
it
!
My
dear
*NL*
sir
,
you
little
know
what
you
have
done
for
us
.
I
should
have
been
*NL*
lost
--
lost
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
taken
hold
of
the
door-handle
meanwhile
,
intending
to
leave
*NL*
the
room
without
reply
;
but
I
was
panting
with
my
run
upstairs
,
and
my
*NL*
exhaustion
came
to
a
climax
in
a
violent
fit
of
coughing
,
so
bad
that
I
*NL*
could
hardly
stand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
saw
how
the
man
dashed
about
the
room
to
find
me
an
empty
chair
,
how
*NL*
he
kicked
the
rags
off
a
chair
which
was
covered
up
by
them
,
brought
it
*NL*
to
me
,
and
helped
me
to
sit
down
;
but
my
cough
went
on
for
another
three
*NL*
minutes
or
so
.
When
I
came
to
myself
he
was
sitting
by
me
on
another
*NL*
chair
,
which
he
had
also
cleared
of
the
rubbish
by
throwing
it
all
over
*NL*
the
floor
,
and
was
watching
me
intently
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
I
'm
afraid
you
are
ill

he
remarked
,
in
the
tone
which
doctors
use
*NL*
when
they
address
a
patient
.
'
I
am
myself
a
medical
man

-LRB-
he
did
not
say
*NL*
`
doctor

-RRB-
,
with
which
words
he
waved
his
hands
towards
the
room
and
*NL*
its
contents
as
though
in
protest
at
his
present
condition

I
see
that

laconically

rising
from

jumped
up

He
was
terribly
confused

did
not
seem
able

scattered

still
in

my
hash
is
quite
settled

I
took
hold
of
the
*NL*
door-handle
again

I
was
on
the
point
of
opening
the
door
and
leaving
my
*NL*
grateful
but
confused
medical
friend
to
himself
and
his
shame

when
my
*NL*
damnable
cough
got
hold
of
me
again

*NL*
``
My
doctor
insisted
on
my
sitting
down
again

get
my
breath

something

who
,
without
leaving
her
place
,
addressed
a
*NL*
few
words
of
gratitude

courtesy
to
me

She
seemed
very
shy
over
it

*NL*
and
her
sickly
face
flushed
up
with
confusion

I
remained
,
but
with
the
*NL*
air
of
a
man
who
knows
he
is
intruding
and
is
anxious
to
get
away

The

remorse

need
a
vent

breaking
off

pointed
to

the

again

this

I
am
in
such
a
position

*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Oh

I
said
,
`
there
's
nothing

quite
a
clear
case

you

*NL*
lost
your

come
up

get
another

you
can

*NL*

`
How
do
you
know
that

he
asked
in
amazement
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Oh
,
it
was
evident
at
the
first
glance
,
'
I
said
ironically
,
but
*NL*
not
intentionally
so
.
`
There
are
lots
of
people
who
come
up
from
the
*NL*
provinces
full
of
hope
,
and
run
about
town
,
and
have
to
live
as
best
*NL*
they
can

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
began
to
talk
at
once
excitedly
and
with
trembling
lips
;
he
began
*NL*
complaining
and
telling
me
his
story
.
He
interested
me
,
I
confess
;
I
sat
*NL*
there
nearly
an
hour
.
His
story
was
a
very
ordinary
one
.
He
had
been
a
*NL*
provincial
doctor
;
he
had
a
civil
appointment
,
and
had
no
sooner
taken
*NL*
it
up
than
intrigues
began
.
Even
his
wife
was
dragged
into
these
.
He
was
*NL*
proud
,
and
flew
into
a
passion
;
there
was
a
change
of
local
government
*NL*
which
acted
in
favour
of
his
opponents
;
his
position
was
undermined
,
*NL*
complaints
were
made
against
him
;
he
lost
his
post
and
came
up
to
*NL*
Petersburg
with
his
last
remaining
money
,
in
order
to
appeal
to
higher
*NL*
authorities
.
Of
course
nobody
would
listen
to
him
for
a
long
time
;
he
*NL*
would
come
and
tell
his
story
one
day
and
be
refused
promptly
;
another
*NL*
day
he
would
be
fed
on
false
promises
;
again
he
would
be
treated
*NL*
harshly
;
then
he
would
be
told
to
sign
some
documents
;
then
he
would
*NL*
sign
the
paper
and
hand
it
in
,
and
they
would
refuse
to
receive
it
,
and
*NL*
tell
him
to
file
a
formal
petition
.
In
a
word
he
had
been
driven
about
*NL*
from
office
to
office
for
five
months
and
had
spent
every
farthing
he
*NL*
had
;
his
wife
's
last
rags
had
just
been
pawned
;
and
meanwhile
a
child
*NL*
had
been
born
to
them
and
--
and
today
I
have
a
final
refusal
to
my
*NL*
petition
,
and
I
have
hardly
a
crumb
of
bread
left
--
I
have
nothing
left
;
*NL*
my
wife
has
had
a
baby
lately

I

*NL*
``
He
sprang
up
from
his
chair
and
turned
away
.
His
wife
was
crying
in
the
*NL*
corner
;
the
child
had
begun
to
moan
again
.
I
pulled
out
my
note-book
and
*NL*
began
writing
in
it
.
When
I
had
finished
and
rose
from
my
chair
he
was
*NL*
standing
before
me
with
an
expression
of
alarmed
curiosity

have
jotted
down

it

the
place
you
served
at

all

I
have
a
*NL*
friend

Bachmatoff

is
a
councillor
of
state

has
to
do

with

he
cried
,
trembling
all
over
with
*NL*
excitement

Why
,
nearly
everything
depends
on
that
very
man
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
very
curious
,
this
story
of
the
medical
man
,
and
my
visit
,
and
*NL*
the
happy
termination
to
which
I
contributed
by
accident
!
Everything
*NL*
fitted
in
,
as
in
a
novel
.
I
told
the
poor
people
not
to
put
much
hope
in
*NL*
me
,
because
I
was
but
a
poor
schoolboy
myself
--
-LRB-
I
am
not
really
,
but
*NL*
I
humiliated
myself
as
much
as
possible
in
order
to
make
them
less
*NL*
hopeful
-RRB-
--
but
that
I
would
go
at
once
to
the
Vassili
Ostroff
and
see
my
*NL*
friend
;
and
that
as
I
knew
for
certain
that
his
uncle
adored
him
,
and
*NL*
was
absolutely
devoted
to
him
as
the
last
hope
and
branch
of
the
family
,
*NL*
perhaps
the
old
man
might
do
something
to
oblige
his
nephew
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
If
only
they
would
allow
me
to
explain
all
to
his
excellency
!
If
I
*NL*
could
but
be
permitted
to
tell
my
tale
to
him
!
''
he
cried
,
trembling
with
*NL*
feverish
agitation
,
and
his
eyes
flashing
with
excitement
.
I
repeated
*NL*
once
more
that
I
could
not
hold
out
much
hope
--
that
it
would
probably
*NL*
end
in
smoke
,
and
if
I
did
not
turn
up
next
morning
they
must
make
up
*NL*
their
minds
that
there
was
no
more
to
be
done
in
the
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
showed
me
out
with
bows
and
every
kind
of
respect
;
they
seemed
*NL*
quite
beside
themselves

I
shall
never
forget
the
expression
of
their
*NL*
faces
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
took
a
droshky
and
drove
over
to
the
Vassili
Ostroff
at
once

For
*NL*
some
years
I
had
been
at
enmity
with
this
young
Bachmatoff
,
at
school
.
*NL*
We
considered
him
an
aristocrat
;
at
all
events
I
called
him
one
.
He
used
*NL*
to
dress
smartly
,
and
always
drove
to
school
in
a
private
trap
.
He
was
*NL*
a
good
companion
,
and
was
always
merry
and
jolly
,
sometimes
even
witty
,
*NL*
though
he
was
not
very
intellectual
,
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
was
*NL*
always
top
of
the
class
;
I
myself
was
never
top
in
anything
!
All
his
*NL*
companions
were
very
fond
of
him
,
excepting
myself
.
He
had
several
times
*NL*
during
those
years
come
up
to
me
and
tried
to
make
friends
;
but
I
had
*NL*
always
turned
sulkily
away
and
refused
to
have
anything
to
do
with
him
.
*NL*
I
had
not
seen
him
for
a
whole
year
now
;
he
was
at
the
university
.
When
,
*NL*
at
nine
o'clock
,
or
so
,
this
evening
,
I
arrived
and
was
shown
up
to
him
*NL*
with
great
ceremony
,
he
first
received
me
with
astonishment
,
and
not
too
*NL*
affably
,
but
he
soon
cheered
up
,
and
suddenly
gazed
intently
at
me
and
*NL*
burst
out
laughing
.

''
`
Why

on
earth
can
have
possessed
you
to
come
and
see

me

he
cried
,
with
his
usual
pleasant
,
sometimes
audacious
,
but
*NL*
never
offensive
familiarity
,
which
I
liked
in
reality
,
but
for
which
I
*NL*
also
detested
him
.
`
Why

's
the
matter

he
cried
in
alarm

`
Are
you
*NL*
ill
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
confounded
cough
of
mine
had
come
on
again

I
fell
into
a
chair

with
difficulty
recovered
my
breath

`
It
's
all
right

it

consumption

I
said
.

I
have
come
to
you
with

petition

*NL*
``
He
sat
down
in
amazement
,
and
I
lost
no
time
in
telling
him
the
medical
*NL*
man
's
history
;
and
explained
that
he
,
with
the
influence
which
he
*NL*
possessed
over
his
uncle
,
might
do
some
good
to
the
poor

`
I
'll
do
it

I
'll
do
it

he
said

I
shall
attack
my
uncle
*NL*
about
it
tomorrow
morning

I

very
glad
you
told
me

story

was
it
that
you
thought
of
coming
to
me
about
it

`
So
much
depends
upon
your
uncle

I
said

besides
we
have
always
*NL*
been
enemies
,
Bachmatoff
;
and
as
you
are
a
generous
sort
of
fellow
,
I
*NL*
thought
you
would
not
refuse
my
request
because
I
was
your
enemy
!
'
I
*NL*
added
with
irony
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Like
Napoleon
going
to
England
,
eh
?
'
cried
he
,
laughing
.
`
I
'll
do
it
*NL*
though
--
of
course
,
and
at
once
,
if
I
can
!
'
he
added
,
seeing
that
I
rose
*NL*
seriously
from
my
chair
at
this
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
sure
enough
the
matter
ended
as
satisfactorily
as
possible
.
A
month
*NL*
or
so
later
my
medical
friend
was
appointed
to
another
post
.
He
got
his
*NL*
travelling
expenses
paid
,
and
something
to
help
him
to
start
life
with
*NL*
once
more
.
I
think
Bachmatoff
must
have
persuaded
the
doctor
to
accept
*NL*
a
loan
from
himself
.
I
saw
Bachmatoff
two
or
three
times
,
about
this
*NL*
period
,
the
third
time
being
when
he
gave
a
farewell
dinner
to
the
*NL*
doctor
and
his
wife
before
their
departure
,
a
champagne
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bachmatoff
saw
me
home
after
the
dinner
and
we
crossed
the
Nicolai
*NL*
bridge
.
We
were
both
a
little
drunk
.
He
told
me
of
his
joy
,
the
joyful
*NL*
feeling
of
having
done
a
good
action
;
he
said
that
it
was
all
thanks
to
*NL*
myself
that
he
could
feel
this
satisfaction
;
and
held
forth
about
the
*NL*
foolishness
of
the
theory
that
individual
charity
is
useless
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
,
too
,
was
burning
to
have
my
say
!
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
In
Moscow
,
'
I
said
,
`
there
was
an
old
state
counsellor
,
a
civil
*NL*
general
,
who
,
all
his
life
,
had
been
in
the
habit
of
visiting
the
*NL*
prisons
and
speaking
to
criminals
.
Every
party
of
convicts
on
its
way
*NL*
to
Siberia
knew
beforehand
that
on
the
Vorobeef
Hills
the
``
old
general
''
*NL*
would
pay
them
a
visit
.
He
did
all
he
undertook
seriously
and
devotedly
.
*NL*
He
would
walk
down
the
rows
of
the
unfortunate
prisoners
,
stop
before
*NL*
each
individual
and
ask
after
his
needs
--
he
never
sermonized
them
;
he
*NL*
spoke
kindly
to
them
--
he
gave
them
money
;
he
brought
them
all
sorts
of
*NL*
necessaries
for
the
journey
,
and
gave
them
devotional
books
,
choosing
*NL*
those
who
could
read
,
under
the
firm
conviction
that
they
would
read
to
*NL*
those
who
could
not
,
as
they
went
along
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
He
scarcely
ever
talked
about
the
particular
crimes
of
any
of
them
,
*NL*
but
listened
if
any
volunteered
information
on
that
point
.
All
the
*NL*
convicts
were
equal
for
him
,
and
he
made
no
distinction
.
He
spoke
to
all
*NL*
as
to
brothers
,
and
every
one
of
them
looked
upon
him
as
a
father
.
When
*NL*
he
observed
among
the
exiles
some
poor
woman
with
a
child
,
he
would
*NL*
always
come
forward
and
fondle
the
little
one
,
and
make
it
laugh
.
He
*NL*
continued
these
acts
of
mercy
up
to
his
very
death
;
and
by
that
time
all
*NL*
the
criminals
,
all
over
Russia
and
Siberia
,
knew
him
!
*NL*
*NL*
''
'
A
man
I
knew
who
had
been
to
Siberia
and
returned
,
told
me
that
he
*NL*
himself
had
been
a
witness
of
how
the
very
most
hardened
criminals
*NL*
remembered
the
old
general
,
though
,
in
point
of
fact
,
he
could
never
,
*NL*
of
course
,
have
distributed
more
than
a
few
pence
to
each
member
of
a
*NL*
party
.
Their
recollection
of
him
was
not
sentimental
or
particularly
*NL*
devoted
.
Some
wretch
,
for
instance
,
who
had
been
a
murderer
--
cutting
the
*NL*
throat
of
a
dozen
fellow-creatures
,
for
instance
;
or
stabbing
six
*NL*
little
children
for
his
own
amusement
-LRB-
there
have
been
such
men
!
-RRB-
--
would
*NL*
perhaps
,
without
rhyme
or
reason
,
suddenly
give
a
sigh
and
say
,
``
I
*NL*
wonder
whether
that
old
general
is
alive
still
!
''
Although
perhaps
he
had
*NL*
not
thought
of
mentioning
him
for
a
dozen
years
before
!
How
can
one
say
*NL*
what
seed
of
good
may
have
been
dropped
into
his
soul
,
never
to
die
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
continued
in
that
strain
for
a
long
while
,
pointing
out
to
Bachmatoff
*NL*
how
impossible
it
is
to
follow
up
the
effects
of
any
isolated
good
deed
*NL*
one
may
do
,
in
all
its
influences
and
subtle
workings
upon
the
heart
and
*NL*
after-actions
of
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
And
to
think
that
you
are
to
be
cut
off
from
life
!
'
remarked
*NL*
Bachmatoff
,
in
a
tone
of
reproach
,
as
though
he
would
like
to
find
*NL*
someone
to
pitch
into
on
my
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
were
leaning
over
the
balustrade
of
the
bridge
,
looking
into
the
*NL*
Neva
at
this
moment

*NL*
''
`
Do
you
know
what
has
suddenly
come
into
my
head

said
I
,
*NL*
suddenly
--
leaning
further
and
further
over
the
rail
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Surely
not
to
throw
yourself
into
the
river
?
'
cried
Bachmatoff
in
*NL*
alarm
.
Perhaps
he
read
my
thought
in
my
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
No
,
not
yet
.
At
present
nothing
but
the
following
consideration
.
You
*NL*
see
I
have
some
two
or
three
months
left
me
to
live
--
perhaps
four
;
well
,
*NL*
supposing
that
when
I
have
but
a
month
or
two
more
,
I
take
a
fancy
for
*NL*
some
``
good
deed
''
that
needs
both
trouble
and
time
,
like
this
business
of
*NL*
our
doctor
friend
,
for
instance
:
why
,
I
shall
have
to
give
up
the
idea
*NL*
of
it
and
take
to
something
else
--
some
_
little
_
good
deed
,
_
more
within
my
*NL*
means
_
,
eh
?
Is
n't
that
an
amusing
idea
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
Bachmatoff
was
much
impressed
--
painfully
so
.
He
took
me
all
the
*NL*
way
home
;
not
attempting
to
console
me
,
but
behaving
with
the
greatest
*NL*
delicacy
.
On
taking
leave
he
pressed
my
hand
warmly
and
asked
permission
*NL*
to
come
and
see
me
.
I
replied
that
if
he
came
to
me
as
a
`
comforter
,
'
so
*NL*
to
speak
-LRB-
for
he
would
be
in
that
capacity
whether
he
spoke
to
me
in
a
*NL*
soothing
manner
or
only
kept
silence
,
as
I
pointed
out
to
him
-RRB-
,
he
*NL*
would
but
remind
me
each
time
of
my
approaching
death
!
He
shrugged
his
*NL*
shoulders
,
but
quite
agreed
with
me
;
and
we
parted
better
friends
than
I
*NL*
had
expected
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
that
evening
and
that
night
were
sown
the
first
seeds
of
my
`
last
*NL*
conviction
.
'
I
seized
greedily
on
my
new
idea
;
I
thirstily
drank
in
*NL*
all
its
different
aspects
-LRB-
I
did
not
sleep
a
wink
that
night
!
-RRB-
,
and
the
*NL*
deeper
I
went
into
it
the
more
my
being
seemed
to
merge
itself
in
it
,
*NL*
and
the
more
alarmed
I
became
.
A
dreadful
terror
came
over
me
at
last
,
*NL*
and
did
not
leave
me
all
next
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sometimes
,
thinking
over
this
,
I
became
quite
numb
with
the
terror
*NL*
of
it
;
and
I
might
well
have
deduced
from
this
fact
,
that
my
`
last
*NL*
conviction
'
was
eating
into
my
being
too
fast
and
too
seriously
,
and
*NL*
would
undoubtedly
come
to
its
climax
before
long
.
And
for
the
climax
I
*NL*
needed
greater
determination
than
I
yet
possessed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
However
,
within
three
weeks
my
determination
was
taken
,
owing
to
a
very
*NL*
strange
circumstance

``
Here
on
my
paper
,
I
make
a
note
of
all
the
figures
and
dates
that
*NL*
come
into
my
explanation
.
Of
course
,
it
is
all
the
same
to
me
,
but
just
*NL*
now
--
and
perhaps
only
at
this
moment
--
I
desire
that
all
those
who
are
to
*NL*
judge
of
my
action
should
see
clearly
out

logical

at

the
*NL*
accomplishment
of
my
final
resolve
,
came
to
hand
not
through
any
*NL*
sequence
of
causes
,
but
thanks
to
a
certain
strange
circumstance
which
*NL*
had
perhaps
no
connection
whatever
with
the
matter
at
issue
.
Ten
days
*NL*
ago
Rogojin
called
upon
me
about
certain
business
of
his
own
with
which
*NL*
I
have
nothing
to
do
at
present
.
I
had
never
seen
Rogojin
before
,
but
*NL*
had
often
heard
about
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
gave
him
all
the
information
he
needed
,
and
he
very
soon
took
his
*NL*
departure
;
so
that
,
since
he
only
came
for
the
purpose
of
gaining
the
*NL*
information
,
the
matter
might
have
been
expected
to
end
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
he
interested
me
too
much
,
and
all
that
day
I
was
under
the
*NL*
influence
of
strange
thoughts
connected
with
him
,
and
I
determined
to
*NL*
return
his
visit
the
next
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rogojin
was
evidently
by
no
means
pleased
to
see
me
,
and
hinted
,
*NL*
delicately
,
that
he
saw
no
reason
why
our
acquaintance
should
continue
.
*NL*
For
all
that
,
however
,
I
spent
a
very
interesting
hour
,
and
so
,
I
dare
*NL*
say
,
did
he
.
There
was
so
great
a
contrast
between
us
that
I
am
sure
we
*NL*
must
both
have
felt
it
;
anyhow
,
I
felt
it
acutely
.
Here
was
I
,
with
my
*NL*
days
numbered
,
and
he
,
a
man
in
the
full
vigour
of
life
,
living
in
*NL*
the
present
,
without
the
slightest
thought
for
`
final
convictions
,
'
or
*NL*
numbers
,
or
days
,
or
,
in
fact
,
for
anything
but
that
which-which
--
well
,
*NL*
which
he
was
mad
about
,
if
he
will
excuse
me
the
expression
--
as
a
feeble
*NL*
author
who
can
not
express
his
ideas
properly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
spite
of
his
lack
of
amiability
,
I
could
not
help
seeing
,
in
Rogojin
*NL*
a
man
of
intellect
and
sense
;
and
although
,
perhaps
,
there
was
little
in
*NL*
the
outside
world
which
was
of
interest
to
him
,
still
he
was
clearly
a
*NL*
man
with
eyes
to
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hinted
nothing
to
him
about
my
`
final
conviction
,
'
but
it
appeared
*NL*
to
me
that
he
had
guessed
it
from
my
words
.
He
remained
silent
--
he
is
*NL*
a
terribly
silent
man
.
I
remarked
to
him
,
as
I
rose
to
depart
,
that
,
*NL*
in
spite
of
the
contrast
and
the
wide
differences
between
us
two
,
*NL*
les
extremites
se
touchent
-LRB-
`
extremes
meet
,
'
as
I
explained
to
him
in
*NL*
Russian
-RRB-
;
so
that
maybe
he
was
not
so
far
from
my
final
conviction
as
*NL*
appeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
only
reply
to
this
was
a
sour
grimace
.
He
rose
and
looked
for
*NL*
my
cap
,
and
placed
it
in
my
hand
,
and
led
me
out
of
the
house
--
that
*NL*
dreadful
gloomy
house
of
his
--
to
all
appearances
,
of
course
,
as
though
I
*NL*
were
leaving
of
my
own
accord
,
and
he
were
simply
seeing
me
to
the
*NL*
door
out
of
politeness
.
His
house
impressed
me
much
;
it
is
like
a
*NL*
burial-ground
,
he
seems
to
like
it
,
which
is
,
however
,
quite
natural
.
*NL*
Such
a
full
life
as
he
leads
is
so
overflowing
with
absorbing
interests
*NL*
that
he
has
little
need
of
assistance
from
his
surroundings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
visit
to
Rogojin
exhausted
me
terribly
.
Besides
,
I
had
felt
ill
*NL*
since
the
morning
;
and
by
evening
I
was
so
weak
that
I
took
to
my
bed
,
*NL*
and
was
in
high
fever
at
intervals
,
and
even
delirious
.
Colia
sat
with
*NL*
me
until
eleven
o'clock
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
I
remember
all
he
talked
about
,
and
every
word
we
said
,
though
*NL*
whenever
my
eyes
closed
for
a
moment
I
could
picture
nothing
but
the
*NL*
image
of
Surikoff
just
in
the
act
of
finding
a
million
roubles
.
He
could
*NL*
not
make
up
his
mind
what
to
do
with
the
money
,
and
tore
his
hair
over
*NL*
it
.
He
trembled
with
fear
that
somebody
would
rob
him
,
and
at
last
*NL*
he
decided
to
bury
it
in
the
ground
.
I
persuaded
him
that
,
instead
of
*NL*
putting
it
all
away
uselessly
underground
,
he
had
better
melt
it
down
*NL*
and
make
a
golden
coffin
out
of
it
for
his
starved
child
,
and
then
dig
*NL*
up
the
little
one
and
put
her
into
the
golden
coffin
.
Surikoff
accepted
*NL*
this
suggestion
,
I
thought
,
with
tears
of
gratitude
,
and
immediately
*NL*
commenced
to
carry
out
my
design
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
I
spat
on
the
ground
and
left
him
in
disgust
.
Colia
told
*NL*
me
,
when
I
quite
recovered
my
senses
,
that
I
had
not
been
asleep
for
a
*NL*
moment
,
but
that
I
had
spoken
to
him
about
Surikoff
the
whole
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
moments
I
was
in
a
state
of
dreadful
weakness
and
misery
,
so
that
*NL*
Colia
was
greatly
disturbed
when
he
left
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
arose
to
lock
the
door
after
him
,
I
suddenly
called
to
mind
a
*NL*
picture
I
had
noticed
at
Rogojin
's
in
one
of
his
gloomiest
rooms
,
over
*NL*
the
door
.
He
had
pointed
it
out
to
me
himself
as
we
walked
past
it
,
and
*NL*
I
believe
I
must
have
stood
a
good
five
minutes
in
front
of
it
.
There
*NL*
was
nothing
artistic
about
it
,
but
the
picture
made
me
feel
strangely
*NL*
uncomfortable
.
It
represented
Christ
just
taken
down
from
the
cross
.
It
*NL*
seems
to
me
that
painters
as
a
rule
represent
the
Saviour
,
both
on
the
*NL*
cross
and
taken
down
from
it
,
with
great
beauty
still
upon
His
face
.
*NL*
This
marvellous
beauty
they
strive
to
preserve
even
in
His
moments
of
*NL*
deepest
agony
and
passion
.
But
there
was
no
such
beauty
in
Rogojin
's
*NL*
picture
.
This
was
the
presentment
of
a
poor
mangled
body
which
had
*NL*
evidently
suffered
unbearable
anguish
even
before
its
crucifixion
,
full
*NL*
of
wounds
and
bruises
,
marks
of
the
violence
of
soldiers
and
people
,
and
*NL*
of
the
bitterness
of
the
moment
when
He
had
fallen
with
the
cross
--
all
*NL*
this
combined
with
the
anguish
of
the
actual
crucifixion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
face
was
depicted
as
though
still
suffering
;
as
though
the
body
,
*NL*
only
just
dead
,
was
still
almost
quivering
with
agony
.
The
picture
was
*NL*
one
of
pure
nature
,
for
the
face
was
not
beautified
by
the
artist
,
but
*NL*
was
left
as
it
would
naturally
be
,
whosoever
the
sufferer
,
after
such
*NL*
anguish
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
that
the
earliest
Christian
faith
taught
that
the
Saviour
*NL*
suffered
actually
and
not
figuratively
,
and
that
nature
was
allowed
her
*NL*
own
way
even
while
His
body
was
on
the
cross
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
strange
to
look
on
this
dreadful
picture
of
the
mangled
corpse
*NL*
of
the
Saviour
,
and
to
put
this
question
to
oneself
:
`
Supposing
that
the
*NL*
disciples
,
the
future
apostles
,
the
women
who
had
followed
Him
and
stood
*NL*
by
the
cross
,
all
of
whom
believed
in
and
worshipped
Him
--
supposing
*NL*
that
they
saw
this
tortured
body
,
this
face
so
mangled
and
bleeding
and
*NL*
bruised
-LRB-
and
they
_
must
_
have
so
seen
it
-RRB-
--
how
could
they
have
gazed
upon
*NL*
the
dreadful
sight
and
yet
have
believed
that
He
would
rise
again
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
thought
steps
in
,
whether
one
likes
it
or
no
,
that
death
is
so
*NL*
terrible
and
so
powerful
,
that
even
He
who
conquered
it
in
His
miracles
*NL*
during
life
was
unable
to
triumph
over
it
at
the
last
.
He
who
called
*NL*
to
Lazarus
,
`
Lazarus
,
come
forth
!
'
and
the
dead
man
lived
--
He
was
now
*NL*
Himself
a
prey
to
nature
and
death
.
Nature
appears
to
one
,
looking
at
*NL*
this
picture
,
as
some
huge
,
implacable
,
dumb
monster
;
or
still
better
--
a
*NL*
stranger
simile
--
some
enormous
mechanical
engine
of
modern
days
which
*NL*
has
seized
and
crushed
and
swallowed
up
a
great
and
invaluable
Being
,
*NL*
a
Being
worth
nature
and
all
her
laws
,
worth
the
whole
earth
,
which
was
*NL*
perhaps
created
merely
for
the
sake
of
the
advent
of
that
Being
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
blind
,
dumb
,
implacable
,
eternal
,
unreasoning
force
is
well
shown
*NL*
in
the
picture
,
and
the
absolute
subordination
of
all
men
and
things
to
*NL*
it
is
so
well
expressed
that
the
idea
unconsciously
arises
in
the
mind
*NL*
of
anyone
who
looks
at
it
.
All
those
faithful
people
who
were
gazing
at
*NL*
the
cross
and
its
mutilated
occupant
must
have
suffered
agony
of
mind
*NL*
that
evening
;
for
they
must
have
felt
that
all
their
hopes
and
almost
*NL*
all
their
faith
had
been
shattered
at
a
blow
.
They
must
have
separated
*NL*
in
terror
and
dread
that
night
,
though
each
perhaps
carried
away
with
*NL*
him
one
great
thought
which
was
never
eradicated
from
his
mind
for
ever
*NL*
afterwards
.
If
this
great
Teacher
of
theirs
could
have
seen
Himself
*NL*
after
the
Crucifixion
,
how
could
He
have
consented
to
mount
the
Cross
*NL*
and
to
die
as
He
did
?
This
thought
also
comes
into
the
mind
of
the
man
*NL*
who
gazes
at
this
picture
.
I
thought
of
all
this
by
snatches
probably
*NL*
between
my
attacks
of
delirium
--
for
an
hour
and
a
half
or
so
before
*NL*
Colia
's
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
there
be
an
appearance
of
that
which
has
no
form
?
And
yet
it
seemed
*NL*
to
me
,
at
certain
moments
,
that
I
beheld
in
some
strange
and
impossible
*NL*
form
,
that
dark
,
dumb
,
irresistibly
powerful
,
eternal
force
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
someone
led
me
by
the
hand
and
showed
me
,
by
the
light
of
*NL*
a
candle
,
a
huge
,
loathsome
insect
,
which
he
assured
me
was
that
very
*NL*
force
,
that
very
almighty
,
dumb
,
irresistible
Power
,
and
laughed
at
*NL*
the
indignation
with
which
I
received
this
information
.
In
my
room
they
*NL*
always
light
the
little
lamp
before
my
icon
for
the
night
;
it
gives
a
*NL*
feeble
flicker
of
light
,
but
it
is
strong
enough
to
see
by
dimly
,
and
*NL*
if
you
sit
just
under
it
you
can
even
read
by
it
.
I
think
it
was
about
*NL*
twelve
or
a
little
past
that
night
.
I
had
not
slept
a
wink
,
and
was
*NL*
lying
with
my
eyes
wide
open
,
when
suddenly
the
door
opened
,
and
in
came
*NL*
Rogojin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
entered
,
and
shut
the
door
behind
him
.
Then
he
silently
gazed
at
me
*NL*
and
went
quickly
to
the
corner
of
the
room
where
the
lamp
was
burning
*NL*
and
sat
down
underneath
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
much
surprised
,
and
looked
at
him
expectantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rogojin
only
leaned
his
elbow
on
the
table
and
silently
stared
at
me
.
*NL*
So
passed
two
or
three
minutes
,
and
I
recollect
that
his
silence
hurt
*NL*
and
offended
me
very
much
.
Why
did
he
not
speak
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
his
arrival
at
this
time
of
night
struck
me
as
more
or
less
*NL*
strange
may
possibly
be
the
case
;
but
I
remember
I
was
by
no
means
*NL*
amazed
at
it
.
On
the
contrary
,
though
I
had
not
actually
told
him
my
*NL*
thought
in
the
morning
,
yet
I
know
he
understood
it
;
and
this
thought
*NL*
was
of
such
a
character
that
it
would
not
be
anything
very
remarkable
,
*NL*
if
one
were
to
come
for
further
talk
about
it
at
any
hour
of
night
,
*NL*
however
late
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
he
must
have
come
for
this
purpose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
morning
we
had
parted
not
the
best
of
friends
;
I
remember
he
*NL*
looked
at
me
with
disagreeable
sarcasm
once
or
twice
;
and
this
same
look
*NL*
I
observed
in
his
eyes
now
--
which
was
the
cause
of
the
annoyance
I
felt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
for
a
moment
suspect
that
I
was
delirious
and
that
this
*NL*
Rogojin
was
but
the
result
of
fever
and
excitement
.
I
had
not
the
*NL*
slightest
idea
of
such
a
theory
at
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Meanwhile
he
continued
to
sit
and
stare
jeeringly
at
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
angrily
turned
round
in
bed
and
made
up
my
mind
that
I
would
not
say
*NL*
a
word
unless
he
did
;
so
I
rested
silently
on
my
pillow
determined
to
*NL*
remain
dumb
,
if
it
were
to
last
till
morning
.
I
felt
resolved
that
he
*NL*
should
speak
first
.
Probably
twenty
minutes
or
so
passed
in
this
way
.
*NL*
Suddenly
the
idea
struck
me
--
what
if
this
is
an
apparition
and
not
*NL*
Rogojin
himself
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Neither
during
my
illness
nor
at
any
previous
time
had
I
ever
seen
an
*NL*
apparition
;
--
but
I
had
always
thought
,
both
when
I
was
a
little
boy
,
and
*NL*
even
now
,
that
if
I
were
to
see
one
I
should
die
on
the
spot
--
though
I
*NL*
do
n't
believe
in
ghosts
.
And
yet
_
now
_
,
when
the
idea
struck
me
that
this
*NL*
was
a
ghost
and
not
Rogojin
at
all
,
I
was
not
in
the
least
alarmed
.
*NL*
Nay
--
the
thought
actually
irritated
me
.
Strangely
enough
,
the
decision
*NL*
of
the
question
as
to
whether
this
were
a
ghost
or
Rogojin
did
not
,
for
*NL*
some
reason
or
other
,
interest
me
nearly
so
much
as
it
ought
to
have
*NL*
done
;
--
I
think
I
began
to
muse
about
something
altogether
different
.
For
*NL*
instance
,
I
began
to
wonder
why
Rogojin
,
who
had
been
in
dressing
--
gown
*NL*
and
slippers
when
I
saw
him
at
home
,
had
now
put
on
a
dress-coat
and
*NL*
white
waistcoat
and
tie
?
I
also
thought
to
myself
,
I
remember
--
`
if
*NL*
this
is
a
ghost
,
and
I
am
not
afraid
of
it
,
why
do
n't
I
approach
it
and
*NL*
verify
my
suspicions
?
Perhaps
I
am
afraid
--
'
And
no
sooner
did
this
last
*NL*
idea
enter
my
head
than
an
icy
blast
blew
over
me
;
I
felt
a
chill
down
*NL*
my
backbone
and
my
knees
shook
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
this
very
moment
,
as
though
divining
my
thoughts
,
Rogojin
raised
his
*NL*
head
from
his
arm
and
began
to
part
his
lips
as
though
he
were
going
to
*NL*
laugh
--
but
he
continued
to
stare
at
me
as
persistently
as
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
felt
so
furious
with
him
at
this
moment
that
I
longed
to
rush
at
*NL*
him
;
but
as
I
had
sworn
that
he
should
speak
first
,
I
continued
to
lie
*NL*
still
--
and
the
more
willingly
,
as
I
was
still
by
no
means
satisfied
as
*NL*
to
whether
it
really
was
Rogojin
or
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
remember
how
long
this
lasted
;
I
can
not
recollect
,
either
,
*NL*
whether
consciousness
forsook
me
at
intervals
,
or
not
.
But
at
last
*NL*
Rogojin
rose
,
staring
at
me
as
intently
as
ever
,
but
not
smiling
any
*NL*
longer
,
--
and
walking
very
softly
,
almost
on
tip-toes
,
to
the
door
,
he
*NL*
opened
it
,
went
out
,
and
shut
it
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
rise
from
my
bed
,
and
I
do
n't
know
how
long
I
lay
with
my
*NL*
eyes
open
,
thinking
.
I
do
n't
know
what
I
thought
about
,
nor
how
I
fell
*NL*
asleep
or
became
insensible
;
but
I
awoke
next
morning
after
nine
o'clock
*NL*
when
they
knocked
at
my
door
.
My
general
orders
are
that
if
I
do
n't
open
*NL*
the
door
and
call
,
by
nine
o'clock
,
Matreona
is
to
come
and
bring
my
*NL*
tea
.
When
I
now
opened
the
door
to
her
,
the
thought
suddenly
struck
*NL*
me
--
how
could
he
have
come
in
,
since
the
door
was
locked
?
I
made
*NL*
inquiries
and
found
that
Rogojin
himself
could
not
possibly
have
come
*NL*
in
,
because
all
our
doors
were
locked
for
the
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
this
strange
circumstance
--
which
I
have
described
with
so
*NL*
much
detail
--
was
the
ultimate
cause
which
led
me
to
taking
my
final
*NL*
determination
.
So
that
no
logic
,
or
logical
deductions
,
had
anything
to
*NL*
do
with
my
resolve
;
--
it
was
simply
a
matter
of
disgust
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
impossible
for
me
to
go
on
living
when
life
was
full
of
such
*NL*
detestable
,
strange
,
tormenting
forms
.
This
ghost
had
humiliated
*NL*
me
;
--
nor
could
I
bear
to
be
subordinate
to
that
dark
,
horrible
force
*NL*
which
was
embodied
in
the
form
of
the
loathsome
insect
.
It
was
only
*NL*
towards
evening
,
when
I
had
quite
made
up
my
mind
on
this
point
,
that
I
*NL*
began
to
feel
easier

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
a
small
pocket

I
had
procured
it

a

at
*NL*
that
droll
age
when
the
stories
of
duels
and
highwaymen
begin
to
delight
*NL*
one
,
and
when
one
imagines
oneself
nobly
standing
fire
at
some
future

day
,
in
a
duel

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
were
a
couple
of

bullets
in

contained
the

in
an
old
flask
for
two

three

*NL*
``
The
pistol
was
a
wretched
thing

very
crooked
and
would
n't
carry
*NL*
farther
than
fifteen
paces
at
the
most
.
However
,
it
would
send
your
*NL*
skull
flying
well
enough

you
pressed
the
muzzle
of
it
against
your
*NL*
temple

*NL*
*NL*

I
determined
to
die
at
Pavlofsk
at
sunrise

in

no
commotion
in
the
house

the

keep

to
give
a

This
is
my
last
will
and
testament
.
As
for
*NL*
my
skeleton

I
bequeath
it
to
the
Medical
Academy
for
the
benefit
of
*NL*
science

*NL*

I
recognize
no

*NL*
``
A
little
while

a
very
amusing

struck
me

What
if
I
were
now
to
*NL*
commit
some
terrible
crime

murder
ten
fellow-creatures
,
for
instance
,
*NL*
or
anything
else
that
is
thought
most
shocking

dreadful
in
this
*NL*
world

what
a
dilemma
my
judges
would
be
in
,
with
a
criminal
who
only
*NL*
has
a
fortnight
to
live
in
any
case
,
now
that
the
rack
and
other
forms
*NL*
of
torture
are
abolished

Why
,
I
should
die
comfortably
in
their
own
*NL*
hospital
--
in
a
warm
,
clean
room
,
with
an
attentive
doctor
--
probably
much
*NL*
more
comfortably
than
I
should
at
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
why
people
in
my
position
do
not
oftener
indulge
in
*NL*
such
ideas

only
for
a

Perhaps
they
do

Who

There
are

But
though
I
do
not
recognize
any
jurisdiction
over
myself
,
still
I
*NL*
know
that
I
shall
be
judged
,
when
I
am
nothing
but
a
voiceless
lump
*NL*
of
clay
;
therefore
I
do
not
wish
to
go
before
I
have
left
a
word
of
*NL*
reply
--
the
reply
of
a
free
man
--
not
one
forced
to
justify
himself
--
oh
*NL*
no
!
I
have
no
need
to
ask
forgiveness
of
anyone
.
I
wish
to
say
a
word
*NL*
merely
because
I
happen
to
desire
it
of
my
own
free
will
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
in
the
first
place
,
comes
a
strange
thought
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
,
in
the
name
of
what
Law
,
would
think
of
disputing
my
full
personal
*NL*
right
over
the
fortnight
of
life
left
to
me
?
What
jurisdiction
can
*NL*
be
brought
to
bear
upon
the
case
?
Who
would
wish
me
,
not
only
to
be
*NL*
sentenced
,
but
to
endure
the
sentence
to
the
end
?
Surely
there
exists
*NL*
no
man
who
would
wish
such
a
thing
--
why
should
anyone
desire
it
?
For
*NL*
the
sake
of
morality
?
Well
,
I
can
understand
that
if
I
were
to
make
*NL*
an
attempt
upon
my
own
life
while
in
the
enjoyment
of
full
health
and
*NL*
vigour
--
my
life
which
might
have
been
`
useful

morality
*NL*
might
reproach
me
,
according
to
the
old
routine
,
for
disposing
of
my
*NL*
life
without
permission
--
or
whatever
its
tenet
may
be
.
But
now
,
_
now
_
,
*NL*
when
my
sentence
is
out
and
my
days
numbered
!
How
can
morality
have
need
*NL*
of
my
last
breaths
,
and
why
should
I
die
listening
to
the
consolations
*NL*
offered
by
the
prince
,
who
,
without
doubt
,
would
not
omit
to
demonstrate
*NL*
that
death
is
actually
a
benefactor
to
me
?
-LRB-
Christians
like
him
always
*NL*
end
up
with
that

it
is
their
pet
theory
.
-RRB-
And
what
do
they
want
with
*NL*
their
ridiculous
`
Pavlofsk
trees
'
?
To
sweeten
my
last
hours
?
Can
not
they
*NL*
understand
that
the
more
I
forget
myself
,
the
more
I
let
myself
become
*NL*
attached
to
these
last
illusions
of
life
and
love
,
by
means
of
which
*NL*
they
try
to
hide
from
me
Meyer

wall
,
and
all
that
is
so
plainly
*NL*
written
on
it
--
the
more
unhappy
they
make
me
?
What
is
the
use
of
all
*NL*
your
nature
to
me
--
all
your
parks
and
trees
,
your
sunsets
and
sunrises
,
*NL*
your
blue
skies
and
your
self-satisfied
faces
--
when
all
this
wealth
*NL*
of
beauty
and
happiness
begins
with
the
fact
that
it
accounts
me
--
only
*NL*
me
--
one
too
many
!
What
is
the
good
of
all
this
beauty
and
glory
to
me
,
*NL*
when
every
second
,
every
moment
,
I
can
not
but
be
aware
that
this
little
*NL*
fly
which
buzzes
around
my
head
in
the
sun
's
rays
--
even
this
little
fly
*NL*
is
a
sharer
and
participator
in
all
the
glory
of
the
universe

knows
*NL*
its
place
and
is
happy
in
it
;

while
I
--
only
I
,
am
an
outcast
,
and
have
*NL*
been
blind
to
the
fact
hitherto

thanks
to
my
simplicity

Oh

know
*NL*
well
how
the

like
me
,
instead
of
indulging
in
*NL*
all
these
wicked
words

to
sing

to
the
glory

triumph
of

is
hidden
the
intensest

bitterness

so
well

the
venom

that
I
dare

the

persuaded
himself
that
his

were
full
of
the
tears

pardon

peace

bitterness

be
*NL*
acting
upon
the
living
world
.
So
be
it
.
I
shall
die
gazing
straight
at
*NL*
the
great
Fountain
of
life
and
power
;
I
do
not
want
this
life
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
had
had
the
power
to
prevent
my
own
birth
I
should
certainly
never
*NL*
have
consented
to
accept
existence
under
such
ridiculous
conditions
.
*NL*
However
,
I
have
the
power
to
end
my
existence
,
although
I
do
but
give
*NL*
back
days
that
are
already
numbered
.
It
is
an
insignificant
gift
,
and
my
*NL*
revolt
is
equally
insignificant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Final
explanation
:
I
die
,
not
in
the
least
because
I
am
unable
to
*NL*
support
these
next
three
weeks
.
Oh
no
,
I
should
find
strength
enough
,
*NL*
and
if
I
wished
it
I
could
obtain
consolation
from
the
thought
of
the
*NL*
injury
that
is
done
me
.
But
I
am
not
a
French
poet
,
and
I
do
not
desire
*NL*
such
consolation
.
And
finally
,
nature
has
so
limited
my
capacity
for
*NL*
work
or
activity
of
any
kind
,
in
allotting
me
but
three
weeks
of
time
,
*NL*
that
suicide
is
about
the
only
thing
left
that
I
can
begin
and
end
in
*NL*
the
time
of
my
own
free
will
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
then
I
am
anxious
to
take
advantage
of
my
last
chance
of
doing
*NL*
something
for
myself
.
A
protest
is
sometimes
no
small
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
explanation
was
finished
;
Hippolyte
paused
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
,
in
extreme
cases
,
a
final
stage
of
cynical
candour
when
a
*NL*
nervous
man
,
excited
,
and
beside
himself
with
emotion
,
will
be
afraid
*NL*
of
nothing
and
ready
for
any
sort
of
scandal
,
nay
,
glad
of
it
.
The
*NL*
extraordinary
,
almost
unnatural
,
tension
of
the
nerves
which
upheld
*NL*
Hippolyte
up
to
this
point
,
had
now
arrived
at
this
final
stage
.
This
*NL*
poor
feeble
boy
of
eighteen
--
exhausted
by
disease
--
looked
for
all
the
*NL*
world
as
weak
and
frail
as
a
leaflet
torn
from
its
parent
tree
and
*NL*
trembling
in
the
breeze
;
but
no
sooner
had
his
eye
swept
over
his
*NL*
audience
,
for
the
first
time
during
the
whole
of
the
last
hour
,
than
the
*NL*
most
contemptuous
,
the
most
haughty
expression
of
repugnance
lighted
*NL*
up
his
face
.
He
defied
them
all
,
as
it
were
.
But
his
hearers
were
*NL*
indignant
,
too
;
they
rose
to
their
feet
with
annoyance
.
Fatigue
,
*NL*
the
wine
consumed
,
the
strain
of
listening
so
long
,
all
added
to
the
*NL*
disagreeable
impression
which
the
reading
had
made
upon
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
Hippolyte
jumped
up
as
though
he
had
been
shot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
sun
is
rising
,
''
he
cried
,
seeing
the
gilded
tops
of
the
trees
,
and
*NL*
pointing
to
them
as
to
a
miracle
.
``
See
,
it
is
rising
now
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
then
?
Did
you
suppose
it
was
n't
going
to
rise
?
''
asked
*NL*
Ferdishenko
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
going
to
be
atrociously
hot
again
all
day
,
''
said
Gania
,
with
an
*NL*
air
of
annoyance
,
taking
his
hat
.
``
A
month
of
this
...
Are
you
coming
*NL*
home
,
Ptitsin
?
''
Hippolyte
listened
to
this
in
amazement
,
almost
*NL*
amounting
to
stupefaction
.
Suddenly
he
became
deadly
pale
and
shuddered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
manage
your
composure
too
awkwardly
.
I
see
you
wish
to
insult
me
,
''
*NL*
he
cried
to
Gania
.
``
You
--
you
are
a
cur
!
''
He
looked
at
Gania
with
an
*NL*
expression
of
malice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
on
earth
is
the
matter
with
the
boy
?
What
phenomenal
*NL*
feeble-mindedness
!
''
exclaimed
Ferdishenko
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
he
's
simply
a
fool
,
''
said
Gania
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hippolyte
braced
himself
up
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
,
gentlemen
,
''
he
began
,
trembling
as
before
,
and
stumbling
*NL*
over
every
word
,
``
that
I
have
deserved
your
resentment
,
and
--
and
*NL*
am
sorry
that
I
should
have
troubled
you
with
this
raving
nonsense
''
*NL*
-LRB-
pointing
to
his
article
-RRB-
,
``
or
rather
,
I
am
sorry
that
I
have
not
*NL*
troubled
you
enough
.
''
He
smiled
feebly
.
``
Have
I
troubled
you
,
Evgenie
*NL*
Pavlovitch
?
''
He
suddenly
turned
on
Evgenie
with
this
question
.
``
Tell
me
*NL*
now
,
have
I
troubled
you
or
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
was
a
little
drawn
out
,
perhaps
;
but
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
speak
out
!
Do
n't
lie
,
for
once
in
your
life

out

*NL*
continued
Hippolyte
,
quivering
with
agitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
good
sir
,
I
assure
you
it
's
entirely
the
same
to
me
.
Please
*NL*
leave
me
in
peace

said
Evgenie
,
angrily
,
turning
his
back
on
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-night
,
prince
,
''
said
Ptitsin
,
approaching
his
host
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
thinking
of

Do
n't
go

'll
blow
his

out
in
a
*NL*
minute
!
''
cried
Vera
Lebedeff
,
rushing
up
to
Hippolyte
and
catching
hold
*NL*
of
his
hands
in
a
torment
of
alarm
.
``
What
are
you
thinking
of

He
said
*NL*
he
would
blow
his
brains
out
at
sunrise
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
he
wo
n't

cried
several
voices
,
sarcastically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
you
'd
better
look
out

''
cried
Colia
,
also
seizing
Hippolyte
*NL*
by
the
hand
.
``
Just
look
at
him
!
Prince
,
what
are
you
thinking
of

''
Vera
*NL*
and
Colia
,
and
Keller
,
and
Burdovsky
were
all
crowding
round
Hippolyte
*NL*
now
and
holding
him
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
the
right

the
right

murmured
Burdovsky
.
``
Excuse
me

prince

*NL*

what
are
your
arrangements

asked
Lebedeff
,
tipsy
and
exasperated
,
*NL*
going
up
to
Muishkin
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
He

suddenly

unexpectedly

with
indignation

*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen

Mr.
Terentieff

''
said
Ptitsin
,
who
had
bidden
the
prince
*NL*
good-night
,
and
was
now
holding
out
his
hand
to
Hippolyte
;
``
I
think
you
*NL*
remark
in
that
manuscript
of
yours

that
you
bequeath
your
skeleton
to
*NL*
the
Academy
.
Are
you
referring
to
your

skeleton

I

your
very
*NL*
bones

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

I

*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
so

I

There
was
a

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do

cried
the
prince
,
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
moved
him
to
tears

added
Ferdishenko
.
But
Hippolyte
was
by
no
*NL*
means
weeping
.
He
was
about
to
move
from
his
place
,
when
his
four
guards
*NL*
rushed
at
him
and
seized
him
once
more
.
There
was
a
laugh
at
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
led
up
to
this
on
purpose

He
took
the
trouble
of
writing
all
that

so

come
and
grab
him
by
the
arm

observed
Rogojin
.
*NL*
``
Good-night

Evgenie
with
a
drawl

with
great
condescension

``
I
only
now
perceive
what
a
terrible
mistake

reading
this

Hippolyte
,
suddenly
,
addressing
Evgenie
,
and
*NL*
looking
at
him
with
an
expression
of
trust
and
confidence

as
though
he

were
applying

for
counsel

replied
Evgenie

laughing

Hippolyte
gazed
steadfastly
at
him

*NL*
but
said
nothing

To
look
at
him
one
might
have
supposed
that
he
was
*NL*
unconscious
at
intervals

*NL*
``
Excuse

Lebedeff

At
this
there
was
a
dreadful
noise

Lebedeff
danced
about
in
his
*NL*
excitement

Ferdishenko
prepared
to
go
for
the
police

Gania
frantically
*NL*
insisted
that
it
was
all
nonsense

Evgenie

all
ablaze

at

expected

to
reply

for
a

added
at

length

addressing

cried

Lebedeff

seizing

Colia
stopped
a
moment
as

wished

something

Lebedeff
dragged
him
away

*NL*
*NL*
Hippolyte
looked
around
at
the
laughing
guests

The
prince
observed
that
*NL*
his
teeth
were
chattering
as
though
in
a
violent
attack
of
ague
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
brutes

all
are

he
whispered
to
the
prince

Whenever

addressed
him
he
lowered
his
voice

*NL*
``
Let

I
am
mad
,
eh
?
''
he
asked
him
,
laughing
very
strangely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
but
you
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Directly
,
directly
!
Stand
still
a
moment
,
I
wish
to
look
in
your
eyes
;
*NL*
do
n't
speak
--
stand
so
--
let
me
look
at
you
!
I
am
bidding
farewell
to
*NL*
mankind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
so
for
ten
seconds
,
gazing
at
the
prince
,
motionless
,
deadly
*NL*
pale
,
his
temples
wet
with
perspiration
;
he
held
the
prince
's
hand
in
a
*NL*
strange
grip
,
as
though
afraid
to
let
him
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hippolyte
,
Hippolyte
,
what
is
the
matter
with
you
?
''
cried
Muishkin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Directly
!
There
,
that
's
enough
.
I
'll
lie
down
directly
.
I
must
drink
to
*NL*
the
sun
's
health
.
I
wish
to
--
I
insist
upon
it
!
Let
go
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
seized
a
glass
from
the
table
,
broke
away
from
the
prince
,
and
in
a
*NL*
moment
had
reached
the
terrace
steps
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
made
after
him
,
but
it
so
happened
that
at
this
moment
*NL*
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
stretched
out
his
hand
to
say
good-night
.
The
next
*NL*
instant
there
was
a
general
outcry
,
and
then
followed
a
few
moments
of
*NL*
indescribable
excitement
.
*NL*
*NL*
Reaching
the
steps
,
Hippolyte
had
paused
,
holding
the
glass
in
his
left
*NL*
hand
while
he
put
his
right
hand
into
his
coat
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
Keller
insisted
afterwards
that
he
had
held
his
right
hand
in
his
pocket
*NL*
all
the
while
,
when
he
was
speaking
to
the
prince
,
and
that
he
had
held
*NL*
the
latter
's
shoulder
with
his
left
hand
only
.
This
circumstance
,
Keller
*NL*
affirmed
,
had
led
him
to
feel
some
suspicion
from
the
first
.
However
*NL*
this
may
be
,
Keller
ran
after
Hippolyte
,
but
he
was
too
late
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
caught
sight
of
something
flashing
in
Hippolyte
's
right
hand
,
and
*NL*
saw
that
it
was
a
pistol
.
He
rushed
at
him
,
but
at
that
very
instant
*NL*
Hippolyte
raised
the
pistol
to
his
temple
and
pulled
the
trigger
.
There
*NL*
followed
a
sharp
metallic
click
,
but
no
report
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Keller
seized
the
would-be
suicide
,
the
latter
fell
forward
into
*NL*
his
arms
,
probably
actually
believing
that
he
was
shot
.
Keller
had
hold
*NL*
of
the
pistol
now
.
Hippolyte
was
immediately
placed
in
a
chair
,
while
*NL*
the
whole
company
thronged
around
excitedly
,
talking
and
asking
each
*NL*
other
questions
.
Every
one
of
them
had
heard
the
snap
of
the
trigger
,
*NL*
and
yet
they
saw
a
live
and
apparently
unharmed
man
before
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hippolyte
himself
sat
quite
unconscious
of
what
was
going
on
,
and
gazed
*NL*
around
with
a
senseless
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lebedeff
and
Colia
came
rushing
up
at
this
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
someone
asked
,
breathlessly
--
``
A
misfire
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
it
was
n't
loaded
,
''
said
several
voices
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
loaded
all
right
,
''
said
Keller
,
examining
the
pistol
,
``
but
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
did
it
miss
fire
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
no
cap
in
it
,
''
Keller
announced
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
be
difficult
to
describe
the
pitiable
scene
that
now
followed
.
*NL*
The
first
sensation
of
alarm
soon
gave
place
to
amusement
;
some
*NL*
burst
out
laughing
loud
and
heartily
,
and
seemed
to
find
a
malicious
*NL*
satisfaction
in
the
joke
.
Poor
Hippolyte
sobbed
hysterically
;
he
wrung
*NL*
his
hands
;
he
approached
everyone
in
turn
--
even
Ferdishenko
--
and
took
*NL*
them
by
both
hands
,
and
swore
solemnly
that
he
had
forgotten
--
absolutely
*NL*
forgotten
--
``
accidentally
,
and
not
on
purpose
,
''
--
to
put
a
cap
in
--
that
*NL*
he
``
had
ten
of
them
,
at
least
,
in
his
pocket
.
''
He
pulled
them
out
and
*NL*
showed
them
to
everyone
;
he
protested
that
he
had
not
liked
to
put
one
*NL*
in
beforehand
for
fear
of
an
accidental
explosion
in
his
pocket
.
That
*NL*
he
had
thought
he
would
have
lots
of
time
to
put
it
in
afterwards
--
when
*NL*
required
--
and
,
that
,
in
the
heat
of
the
moment
,
he
had
forgotten
all
*NL*
about
it
.
He
threw
himself
upon
the
prince
,
then
on
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
.
*NL*
He
entreated
Keller
to
give
him
back
the
pistol
,
and
he
'd
soon
show
them
*NL*
all
that
``
his
honour
--
his
honour
,
''
--
but
he
was
``
dishonoured
,
now
,
for
*NL*
ever
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
fell
senseless
at
last
--
and
was
carried
into
the
prince
's
study
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lebedeff
,
now
quite
sobered
down
,
sent
for
a
doctor
;
and
he
and
his
*NL*
daughter
,
with
Burdovsky
and
General
Ivolgin
,
remained
by
the
sick
man
's
*NL*
couch
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
was
carried
away
unconscious
,
Keller
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
*NL*
room
,
and
made
the
following
declaration
to
the
company
in
general
,
in
a
*NL*
loud
tone
of
voice
,
with
emphasis
upon
each
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
if
any
one
of
you
casts
any
doubt
again
,
before
me
,
*NL*
upon
Hippolyte
's
good
faith
,
or
hints
that
the
cap
was
forgotten
*NL*
intentionally
,
or
suggests
that
this
unhappy
boy
was
acting
a
part
*NL*
before
us
,
I
beg
to
announce
that
the
person
so
speaking
shall
account
*NL*
to
me
for
his
words
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
company
departed
very
quickly
,
in
a
mass
.
Ptitsin
,
Gania
,
and
*NL*
Rogojin
went
away
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
was
much
astonished
that
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
changed
his
mind
,
*NL*
and
took
his
departure
without
the
conversation
he
had
requested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
wished
to
have
a
talk
with
me
when
the
others
left
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
so
,
''
said
Evgenie
,
sitting
down
suddenly
beside
him
,
``
but
I
have
*NL*
changed
my
mind
for
the
time
being
.
I
confess
,
I
am
too
disturbed
,
and
*NL*
so
,
I
think
,
are
you
;
and
the
matter
as
to
which
I
wished
to
consult
you
*NL*
is
too
serious
to
tackle
with
one
's
mind
even
a
little
disturbed
;
too
*NL*
serious
both
for
myself
and
for
you
.
You
see
,
prince
,
for
once
in
my
*NL*
life
I
wish
to
perform
an
absolutely
honest
action
,
that
is
,
an
action
*NL*
with
no
ulterior
motive
;
and
I
think
I
am
hardly
in
a
condition
to
talk
*NL*
of
it
just
at
this
moment
,
and
--
and
--
well
,
we
'll
discuss
it
another
*NL*
time
.
Perhaps
the
matter
may
gain
in
clearness
if
we
wait
for
two
*NL*
or
three
days
--
just
the
two
or
three
days
which
I
must
spend
in
*NL*
Petersburg
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
he
rose
again
from
his
chair
,
so
that
it
seemed
strange
that
he
*NL*
should
have
thought
it
worth
while
to
sit
down
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
thought
,
too
,
that
he
looked
vexed
and
annoyed
,
and
not
*NL*
nearly
so
friendly
towards
himself
as
he
had
been
earlier
in
the
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
will
go
to
the
sufferer
's
bedside
now
?
''
he
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
am
afraid
...
''
began
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
need
n't
fear
!
He
'll
live
another
six
weeks
all
right
.
Very
*NL*
likely
he
will
recover
altogether
;
but
I
strongly
advise
you
to
pack
him
*NL*
off
tomorrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
may
have
offended
him
by
saying
nothing
just
now
.
I
am
afraid
*NL*
he
may
suspect
that
I
doubted
his
good
faith
,
--
about
shooting
himself
,
*NL*
you
know
.
What
do
you
think
,
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
bit
of
it
!
You
are
much
too
good
to
him
;
you
should
n't
care
a
*NL*
hang
about
what
he
thinks
.
I
have
heard
of
such
things
before
,
but
never
*NL*
came
across
,
till
tonight
,
a
man
who
would
actually
shoot
himself
in
*NL*
order
to
gain
a
vulgar
notoriety
,
or
blow
out
his
brains
for
spite
,
*NL*
if
he
finds
that
people
do
n't
care
to
pat
him
on
the
back
for
his
*NL*
sanguinary
intentions
.
But
what
astonishes
me
more
than
anything
is
*NL*
the
fellow
's
candid
confession
of
weakness
.
You
'd
better
get
rid
of
him
*NL*
tomorrow
,
in
any
case

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
he
will
make
another
attempt
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
not
he
,
not
now
!
But
you
have
to
be
very
careful
with
this
*NL*
sort
of
gentleman
.
Crime
is
too
often
the
last
resource
of
these
petty
*NL*
nonentities
.
This
young
fellow
is
quite
capable
of
cutting
the
throats
*NL*
of
ten
people
,
simply
for
a
lark
,
as
he
told
us
in
his
`
explanation
.

I
*NL*
assure
you
those
confounded
words
of
his
will
not
let
me
sleep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
disturb
yourself
too
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
an
extraordinary
person
you
are
,
prince
!
Do
you
mean
to
say
that
*NL*
you
doubt
the
fact
that
he
is
capable
of
murdering
ten
men
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dare
n't
say
,
one
way
or
the
other

all
this
is
very
strange

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
as
you
like
,
just
as
you
like

said
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
,
*NL*
irritably
.
``
Only
you
are
such
a
plucky
fellow
,
take
care
you
do
n't
get
*NL*
included
among
the
ten
victims
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
he
is
much
more
likely
not
to
kill
anyone
at
all
,
''
said
the
prince
,
*NL*
gazing
thoughtfully
at
Evgenie
.
The
latter
laughed
disagreeably
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
_
au
revoir
!
_
Did
you
observe
that
he
`
willed
'
a
copy
of
his
*NL*
confession
to
Aglaya
Ivanovna
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
did
;
I
am
thinking
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
connection
with
`
the
ten
,
'
eh
?
''
laughed
Evgenie
,
as
he
left
the
*NL*
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
hour
later
,
towards
four
o'clock
,
the
prince
went
into
the
park
.
*NL*
He
had
endeavoured
to
fall
asleep
,
but
could
not
,
owing
to
the
painful
*NL*
beating
of
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
left
things
quiet
and
peaceful
;
the
invalid
was
fast
asleep
,
and
*NL*
the
doctor
,
who
had
been
called
in
,
had
stated
that
there
was
no
special
*NL*
danger
.
Lebedeff
,
Colia
,
and
Burdovsky
were
lying
down
in
the
sick-room
,
*NL*
ready
to
take
it
in
turns
to
watch
.
There
was
nothing
to
fear
,
*NL*
therefore
,
at
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
prince
's
mental
perturbation
increased
every
moment
.
He
wandered
*NL*
about
the
park
,
looking
absently
around
him
,
and
paused
in
astonishment
*NL*
when
he
suddenly
found
himself
in
the
empty
space
with
the
rows
of
*NL*
chairs
round
it
,
near
the
Vauxhall
.
The
look
of
the
place
struck
him
*NL*
as
dreadful
now
:
so
he
turned
round
and
went
by
the
path
which
he
had
*NL*
followed
with
the
Epanchins
on
the
way
to
the
band
,
until
he
reached
the
*NL*
green
bench
which
Aglaya
had
pointed
out
for
their
rendezvous
.
He
sat
*NL*
down
on
it
and
suddenly
burst
into
a
loud
fit
of
laughter
,
immediately
*NL*
followed
by
a
feeling
of
irritation
.
His
disturbance
of
mind
continued
;
*NL*
he
felt
that
he
must
go
away
somewhere
,
anywhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
Above
his
head
some
little
bird
sang
out
,
of
a
sudden
;
he
began
to
peer
*NL*
about
for
it
among
the
leaves
.
Suddenly
the
bird
darted
out
of
the
tree
*NL*
and
away
,
and
instantly
he
thought
of
the
``
fly
buzzing
about
in
the
*NL*
sun
's
rays
''
that
Hippolyte
had
talked
of
;
how
that
it
knew
its
place
*NL*
and
was
a
participator
in
the
universal
life
,
while
he
alone
was
an
*NL*
``
outcast
.
''
This
picture
had
impressed
him
at
the
time
,
and
he
meditated
*NL*
upon
it
now
.
An
old
,
forgotten
memory
awoke
in
his
brain
,
and
suddenly
*NL*
burst
into
clearness
and
light
.
It
was
a
recollection
of
Switzerland
,
*NL*
during
the
first
year
of
his
cure
,
the
very
first
months
.
At
that
time
*NL*
he
had
been
pretty
nearly
an
idiot
still
;
he
could
not
speak
properly
,
*NL*
and
had
difficulty
in
understanding
when
others
spoke
to
him
.
He
climbed
*NL*
the
mountain-side
,
one
sunny
morning
,
and
wandered
long
and
aimlessly
*NL*
with
a
certain
thought
in
his
brain
,
which
would
not
become
clear
.
Above
*NL*
him
was
the
blazing
sky
,
below
,
the
lake
;
all
around
was
the
horizon
,
*NL*
clear
and
infinite
.
He
looked
out
upon
this
,
long
and
anxiously
.
He
*NL*
remembered
how
he
had
stretched
out
his
arms
towards
the
beautiful
,
*NL*
boundless
blue
of
the
horizon
,
and
wept
,
and
wept
.
What
had
so
tormented
*NL*
him
was
the
idea
that
he
was
a
stranger
to
all
this
,
that
he
was
outside
*NL*
this
glorious
festival
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
this
universe
?
What
was
this
grand
,
eternal
pageant
to
which
*NL*
he
had
yearned
from
his
childhood
up
,
and
in
which
he
could
never
take
*NL*
part
?
Every
morning
the
same
magnificent
sun
;
every
morning
the
*NL*
same
rainbow
in
the
waterfall
;
every
evening
the
same
glow
on
the
*NL*
snow-mountains
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
little
fly
that
buzzed
in
the
sun
's
rays
was
a
singer
in
the
*NL*
universal
chorus
,
``
knew
its
place
,
and
was
happy
in
it
.
''
Every
blade
of
*NL*
grass
grew
and
was
happy
.
Everything
knew
its
path
and
loved
it
,
went
*NL*
forth
with
a
song
and
returned
with
a
song
;
only
he
knew
nothing
,
*NL*
understood
nothing
,
neither
men
nor
words
,
nor
any
of
nature
's
voices
;
*NL*
he
was
a
stranger
and
an
outcast
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
,
he
could
not
then
speak
these
words
,
or
express
all
he
felt
!
He
had
*NL*
been
tormented
dumbly
;
but
now
it
appeared
to
him
that
he
must
have
*NL*
said
these
very
words
--
even
then
--
and
that
Hippolyte
must
have
taken
his
*NL*
picture
of
the
little
fly
from
his
tears
and
words
of
that
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
sure
of
it
,
and
his
heart
beat
excitedly
at
the
thought
,
he
knew
*NL*
not
why
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
fell
asleep
on
the
bench
;
but
his
mental
disquiet
continued
through
*NL*
his
slumbers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
before
he
dozed
off
,
the
idea
of
Hippolyte
murdering
ten
men
*NL*
flitted
through
his
brain
,
and
he
smiled
at
the
absurdity
of
such
a
*NL*
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
Around
him
all
was
quiet
;
only
the
flutter
and
whisper
of
the
leaves
*NL*
broke
the
silence
,
but
broke
it
only
to
cause
it
to
appear
yet
more
deep
*NL*
and
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
dreamed
many
dreams
as
he
sat
there
,
and
all
were
full
of
disquiet
,
*NL*
so
that
he
shuddered
every
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
a
woman
seemed
to
approach
him
.
He
knew
her
,
oh
!
he
knew
her
*NL*
only
too
well
.
He
could
always
name
her
and
recognize
her
anywhere
;
but
,
*NL*
strange
,
she
seemed
to
have
quite
a
different
face
from
hers
,
as
he
had
*NL*
known
it
,
and
he
felt
a
tormenting
desire
to
be
able
to
say
she
was
not
*NL*
the
same
woman
.
In
the
face
before
him
there
was
such
dreadful
remorse
*NL*
and
horror
that
he
thought
she
must
be
a
criminal
,
that
she
must
have
*NL*
just
committed
some
awful
crime
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tears
were
trembling
on
her
white
cheek
.
She
beckoned
him
,
but
placed
*NL*
her
finger
on
her
lip
as
though
to
warn
him
that
he
must
follow
her
very
*NL*
quietly
.
His
heart
froze
within
him
.
He
would
n't
,
he
_
could
n't
_
confess
*NL*
her
to
be
a
criminal
,
and
yet
he
felt
that
something
dreadful
would
*NL*
happen
the
next
moment
,
something
which
would
blast
his
whole
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
seemed
to
wish
to
show
him
something
,
not
far
off
,
in
the
park
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
rose
from
his
seat
in
order
to
follow
her
,
when
a
bright
,
clear
peal
*NL*
of
laughter
rang
out
by
his
side
.
He
felt
somebody
's
hand
suddenly
in
*NL*
his
own
,
seized
it
,
pressed
it
hard
,
and
awoke
.
Before
him
stood
Aglaya
,
*NL*
laughing
aloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
VIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
laughed
,
but
she
was
rather
angry
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
asleep
!
You
were
asleep
,
''
she
said
,
with
contemptuous
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
really
you
?
''
muttered
the
prince
,
not
quite
himself
as
yet
,
*NL*
and
recognizing
her
with
a
start
of
amazement
.
``
Oh
yes
,
of
course
,
''
he
*NL*
added
,
``
this
is
our
rendezvous
.
I
fell
asleep
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
saw
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
no
one
awake
me
besides
yourself
?
Was
there
no
one
else
here
?
I
*NL*
thought
there
was
another
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
another
woman
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
he
was
wide
awake
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a
dream
,
of
course
,
''
he
said
,
musingly
.
``
Strange
that
I
should
*NL*
have
a
dream
like
that
at
such
a
moment
.
Sit
down
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
her
hand
and
seated
her
on
the
bench
;
then
sat
down
beside
her
*NL*
and
reflected
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aglaya
did
not
begin
the
conversation
,
but
contented
herself
with
*NL*
watching
her
companion
intently
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
back
at
her
,
but
at
times
it
was
clear
that
he
did
not
see
her
*NL*
and
was
not
thinking
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aglaya
began
to
flush
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
!
''
cried
the
prince
,
starting
.
``
Hippolyte
's
suicide
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
At
your
house
?
''
she
asked
,
but
without
much
surprise
.
``
He
was
*NL*
alive
yesterday
evening
,
was
n't
he
?
How
could
you
sleep
here
after
*NL*
that
?
''
she
cried
,
growing
suddenly
animated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
he
did
n't
kill
himself
;
the
pistol
did
n't
go
off
.
''
Aglaya
*NL*
insisted
on
hearing
the
whole
story
.
She
hurried
the
prince
along
,
but
*NL*
interrupted
him
with
all
sorts
of
questions
,
nearly
all
of
which
were
*NL*
irrelevant
.
Among
other
things
,
she
seemed
greatly
interested
in
every
*NL*
word
that
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
had
said
,
and
made
the
prince
repeat
that
*NL*
part
of
the
story
over
and
over
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
'll
do
;
we
must
be
quick
,
''
she
concluded
,
after
hearing
all
.
*NL*
``
We
have
only
an
hour
here
,
till
eight
;
I
must
be
home
by
then
without
*NL*
fail
,
so
that
they
may
not
find
out
that
I
came
and
sat
here
with
you
;
*NL*
but
I
've
come
on
business
.
I
have
a
great
deal
to
say
to
you
.
But
you
*NL*
have
bowled
me
over
considerably
with
your
news
.
As
to
Hippolyte
,
I
*NL*
think
his
pistol
was
bound
not
to
go
off
;
it
was
more
consistent
with
*NL*
the
whole
affair
.
Are
you
sure
he
really
wished
to
blow
his
brains
out
,
*NL*
and
that
there
was
no
humbug
about
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
humbug
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
likely
.
So
he
wrote
that
you
were
to
bring
me
a
copy
of
his
*NL*
confession
,
did
he
?
Why
did
n't
you
bring
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
he
did
n't
die
!
I
'll
ask
him
for
it
,
if
you
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bring
it
by
all
means
;
you
need
n't
ask
him
.
He
will
be
delighted
,
you
*NL*
may
be
sure
;
for
,
in
all
probability
,
he
shot
at
himself
simply
in
order
*NL*
that
I
might
read
his
confession
.
Do
n't
laugh
at
what
I
say
,
please
,
Lef
*NL*
Nicolaievitch
,
because
it
may
very
well
be
the
case
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
laughing
.
I
am
convinced
,
myself
,
that
that
may
have
been
*NL*
partly
the
reason
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
convinced
?
You
do
n't
really
mean
to
say
you
think
that
*NL*
honestly
?
''
asked
Aglaya
,
extremely
surprised
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
put
her
questions
very
quickly
and
talked
fast
,
every
now
and
then
*NL*
forgetting
what
she
had
begun
to
say
,
and
not
finishing
her
sentence
.
*NL*
She
seemed
to
be
impatient
to
warn
the
prince
about
something
or
other
.
*NL*
She
was
in
a
state
of
unusual
excitement
,
and
though
she
put
on
a
brave
*NL*
and
even
defiant
air
,
she
seemed
to
be
rather
alarmed
.
She
was
dressed
*NL*
very
simply
,
but
this
suited
her
well
.
She
continually
trembled
and
*NL*
blushed
,
and
she
sat
on
the
very
edge
of
the
seat
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fact
that
the
prince
confirmed
her
idea
,
about
Hippolyte
shooting
*NL*
himself
that
she
might
read
his
confession
,
surprised
her
greatly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
''
added
the
prince
,
``
he
wished
us
all
to
applaud
his
*NL*
conduct
--
besides
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
mean
--
applaud
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
how
am
I
to
explain
?
He
was
very
anxious
that
we
should
all
come
*NL*
around
him
,
and
say
we
were
so
sorry
for
him
,
and
that
we
loved
him
*NL*
very
much
,
and
all
that
;
and
that
we
hoped
he
would
n't
kill
himself
,
but
*NL*
remain
alive
.
Very
likely
he
thought
more
of
you
than
the
rest
of
us
,
*NL*
because
he
mentioned
you
at
such
a
moment
,
though
perhaps
he
did
not
*NL*
know
himself
that
he
had
you
in
his
mind
's
eye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
you
.
How
could
he
have
me
in
view
,
and
not
be
aware
*NL*
of
it
himself
?
And
yet
,
I
do
n't
know
--
perhaps
I
do
.
Do
you
know
I
*NL*
have
intended
to
poison
myself
at
least
thirty
times
--
ever
since
I
was
*NL*
thirteen
or
so
--
and
to
write
to
my
parents
before
I
did
it
?
I
used
*NL*
to
think
how
nice
it
would
be
to
lie
in
my
coffin
,
and
have
them
all
*NL*
weeping
over
me
and
saying
it
was
all
their
fault
for
being
so
cruel
,
*NL*
and
all
that
--
what
are
you
smiling
at
?
''
she
added
,
knitting
her
brow
.
*NL*
``
What
do
_
you
_
think
of
when
you
go
mooning
about
alone
?
I
suppose
*NL*
you
imagine
yourself
a
field-marshal
,
and
think
you
have
conquered
*NL*
Napoleon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
really
have
thought
something
of
the
sort
now
and
then
,
*NL*
especially
when
just
dozing
off
,
''
laughed
the
prince
.
``
Only
it
is
the
*NL*
Austrians
whom
I
conquer
--
not
Napoleon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
wish
to
joke
with
you
,
Lef
Nicolaievitch
.
I
shall
see
Hippolyte
*NL*
myself
.
Tell
him
so
.
As
for
you
,
I
think
you
are
behaving
very
badly
,
*NL*
because
it
is
not
right
to
judge
a
man
's
soul
as
you
are
judging
*NL*
Hippolyte
's
.
You
have
no
gentleness
,
but
only
justice
--
so
you
are
*NL*
unjust
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
reflected
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
are
unfair
towards
me
,
''
he
said
.
``
There
is
nothing
wrong
*NL*
in
the
thoughts
I
ascribe
to
Hippolyte
;
they
are
only
natural
.
But
of
*NL*
course
I
do
n't
know
for
certain
what
he
thought
.
Perhaps
he
thought
*NL*
nothing
,
but
simply
longed
to
see
human
faces
once
more
,
and
to
hear
*NL*
human
praise
and
feel
human
affection
.
Who
knows
?
Only
it
all
came
out
*NL*
wrong
,
somehow
.
Some
people
have
luck
,
and
everything
comes
out
right
*NL*
with
them
;
others
have
none
,
and
never
a
thing
turns
out
fortunately
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
have
felt
that
in
your
own
case
,
''
said
Aglaya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
have
,
''
replied
the
prince
,
quite
unsuspicious
of
any
irony
in
*NL*
the
remark
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
H
'm
--
well
,
at
all
events

I
should
n't
have
fallen
asleep
here

in
your

place

It
was
n't
nice
of
you
,
that
.
I
suppose
you
fall
asleep
wherever
*NL*
you
sit
down
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
did
n't
sleep
a
wink
all
night

I
walked
and
walked
about
,

*NL*
went
to
where
the
music
was
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
music
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
they
played
last
night

Then
I
found
this
bench
and
sat
down
,

*NL*
thought

thought

and
at
last
I
fell
fast
asleep

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

is
that
it

That
makes
a
difference

perhaps

the
bandstand
for

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do

*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well

I
understand
quite
well

You
are
very

Well

*NL*
how
did
she
appear
to
you
?
What
did
she
look
like
?
No
,
I
do
n't
want
to
*NL*
know
anything
about
her
,
''
said
Aglaya
,
angrily
;
``
do
n't
interrupt
me
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
paused
a
moment
as
though
getting
breath
,
or
trying
to
master
her
*NL*
feeling
of
annoyance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
;
this
is
what
I
called
you
here
for

I
wish
to
make
you
a

to
*NL*
ask
you
to
be
my
friend
.
What
do
you
stare
at
me
like
that
for
?
''
she
*NL*
added
,
almost
angrily
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
certainly
had
darted
a
rather
piercing
look
at
her
,
and
now
*NL*
observed
that
she
had
begun
to
blush
violently
.
At
such
moments
,
the
*NL*
more
Aglaya
blushed
,
the
angrier
she
grew
with
herself
;
and
this
was
*NL*
clearly
expressed
in
her
eyes
,
which
flashed
like
fire
.
As
a
rule
,
she
*NL*
vented
her
wrath
on
her
unfortunate
companion
,
be
it
who
it
might
.
She
*NL*
was
very
conscious
of
her
own
shyness
,
and
was
not
nearly
so
talkative
*NL*
as
her
sisters
for
this
reason
--
in
fact
,
at
times
she
was
much
too
*NL*
quiet
.
When
,
therefore
,
she
was
bound
to
talk
,
especially
at
such
*NL*
delicate
moments
as
this
,
she
invariably
did
so
with
an
air
of
haughty
*NL*
defiance
.
She
always
knew
beforehand
when
she
was
going
to
blush
,
long
*NL*
before
the
blush
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
you
do
not
wish
to
accept
my
proposition
?
''
she
asked
,
gazing
*NL*
haughtily
at
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
I
do
;
but
it
is
so
unnecessary
.
I
mean
,
I
did
not
think
you
*NL*
need
make
such
a
proposition
,
''
said
the
prince
,
looking
confused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
you
suppose
,
then
?
Why
did
you
think
I
invited
you
out
here
?
I
*NL*
suppose
you
think
me
a
`
little
fool
,
'
as
they
all
call
me
at
home
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
know
they
called
you
a
fool
.
I
certainly
do
n't
think
you
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
think
me
one
!
Oh
,
dear
me
!
--
that
's
very
clever
of
you

you
*NL*
put
it
so
neatly
,
too
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
In
my
opinion
,
you
are
far
from
a
fool
sometimes
--
in
fact
,
you
are
very
*NL*
intelligent
.
You
said
a
very
clever
thing
just
now
about
my
being
unjust
*NL*
because
I
had
_
only
_
justice
.
I
shall
remember
that
,
and
think
about
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
Aglaya
blushed
with
pleasure
.
All
these
changes
in
her
expression
came
*NL*
about
so
naturally
and
so
rapidly
--
they
delighted
the
prince
;
he
watched
*NL*
her
,
and
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
''
she
began
again
;
``
I
have
long
waited
to
tell
you
all
this
,
*NL*
ever
since
the
time
when
you
sent
me
that
letter
--
even
before
that
.
*NL*
Half
of
what
I
have
to
say
you
heard
yesterday
.
I
consider
you
the
most
*NL*
honest
and
upright
of
men
--
more
honest
and
upright
than
any
other
*NL*
man
;
and
if
anybody
says
that
your
mind
is
--
is
sometimes
affected
,
you
*NL*
know
--
it
is
unfair
.
I
always
say
so
and
uphold
it
,
because
even
if
your
*NL*
surface
mind
be
a
little
affected
-LRB-
of
course
you
will
not
feel
angry
*NL*
with
me
for
talking
so
--
I
am
speaking
from
a
higher
point
of
view
-RRB-
yet
*NL*
your
real
mind
is
far
better
than
all
theirs
put
together
.
Such
a
*NL*
mind
as
they
have
never
even
_
dreamed
_
of
;
because
really
,
there
are
*NL*
_
two
_
minds
--
the
kind
that
matters
,
and
the
kind
that
does
n't
matter
.
*NL*
Is
n't
it
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
be
!
may
be
so
!
''
said
the
prince
,
faintly
;
his
heart
was
beating
*NL*
painfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
you
would
not
misunderstand
me
,
''
she
said
,
triumphantly
.
``
Prince
*NL*
S.
and
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
and
Alexandra
do
n't
understand
anything
about
*NL*
these
two
kinds

mind

just
fancy

mamma
does

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very
like
Lizabetha
Prokofievna

*NL*
*NL*
``
What

surely
not

said
Aglaya
.
*NL*
*NL*

Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank

I

said
,
thoughtfully
.
``
You
*NL*
respect
her
very
much

do
n't
you

she
added
,
quite
unconscious
of
the
*NL*
naiveness
of
the
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Very
_
much

and
I
am
so
glad
that
you
have
realized
the
fact

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
glad
,
too
,
because
she
is
often
laughed
at
by
people

But
*NL*
listen
to
the
chief
point
.
I
have
long
thought
over
the
matter
,
and
at
*NL*
last
I
have
chosen
you
.
I
do
n't

I
do

wish
*NL*
people
to

me
a

I
do
n't
want
to
be
chaffed

I
felt
*NL*
all
this
of
a
sudden
,
and
I
refused
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
flatly
,
because
*NL*
I
am
not
going
to
be
forever
thrown
at
people
's
heads
to
be
married
.
I
*NL*
want
--
I
want
--
well
,
I
'll
tell
you
,
I
wish
to
run
away
from
home
,
and
I
*NL*
have
chosen
you
to
help
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Run
away
from

cried
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
yes
--
yes
!
Run
away
from
home

''
she
repeated
,
in
a
transport
of
*NL*
rage
.
``
I
wo
n't
,
I
wo
n't
be
made
to
blush
every

I
*NL*
do
n't
want
to
blush
before
Prince
S.
or
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
,
or
*NL*
anyone
,
and
therefore
I
have
chosen
you
.
I
shall
tell
you
everything
,
*NL*
_
everything
_
,
even
the
most
important
things
of
all
,
whenever
I
like

*NL*
and
you
are
to
hide
nothing
from
me
on
your
side

I
want
to
speak
to
at
*NL*
least
one
person
,
as
I
would
to
myself
.
They
have
suddenly
begun
to
say
*NL*
that
I
am
waiting
for
you
,
and
in
love
with
you
.
They
began
this
before
*NL*
you
arrived
here
,
and
so
I
did
n't
show
them
the
letter
,
and
now
they
all
*NL*
say
it
,
every
one
of
them

I
want
to
be
brave
,
and
be
afraid
of
nobody

*NL*
I
do
n't
want
to
go
to
their
balls
and
things
--
I
want
to
do
good
.
I
have
*NL*
long
desired
to
run
away
,
for
I
have
been
kept
shut
up
for
twenty
years
,
*NL*
and
they
are
always
trying
to
marry
me
off
.
I
wanted
to
run
away
when
I
*NL*
was
fourteen
years
old
--
I
was
a
little
fool
then
,
I
know
--
but
now
I
have
*NL*
worked
it
all
out
,
and
I
have
waited
for
you
to
tell
me
about
foreign
*NL*
countries
.
I
have
never
seen
a
single
Gothic
cathedral
.
I
must
go
to
*NL*
Rome
;
I
must
see
all
the
museums
;
I
must
study
in
Paris
.
All
this
last
*NL*
year
I
have
been
preparing
and
reading
forbidden
books
.
Alexandra
and
*NL*
Adelaida
are
allowed
to
read
anything
they
like
,
but
I
may
n't
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
want
to
quarrel
with
my
sisters
,
but
I
told
my
parents
long
ago
that
I
*NL*
wish
to
change
my
social
position
.
I
have
decided
to
take
up
teaching
,
*NL*
and
I
count
on
you
because
you
said
you
loved
children
.
Can
we
go
in
for
*NL*
education
together
--
if
not
at
once
,
then
afterwards
?
We
could
do
good
*NL*
together
.
I
wo
n't
be
a
general
's
daughter
any
more
!
Tell
me
,
are
you
a
*NL*
very
learned
man
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no

not
at
all

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh-h-h

I
'm
sorry
for
that

I
thought
you
were

I
wonder
why
I
always
*NL*
thought
so

but
at
all
events
you
'll
help
me

she
cried

and
her
eyes
flashed
again
*NL*
with
anger
--
``
and
if
you
do
n't
agree
I
shall
go

marry

*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
out
of

cried
the
prince
,
almost
starting
from
his
*NL*
seat
.
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
At

they
do

they

it

I
told
them
all
so
to
their
*NL*
faces

I
told
mother

father
and
everybody
.
Mamma
was
ill
all
the
*NL*
day
after
it
,
and
next
day
father
and
Alexandra
told
me
that
I
did
n't
*NL*
understand
what
nonsense
I
was
talking
.
I
informed
them
that
they
*NL*
little
knew
me

I
was
not
a
small
child

I
understood
every
word

that
I
had
read
a
couple
of
Paul
de
Kok
's
novels
two
years
*NL*
since
on
purpose

so

to
know
all
about
everything

No
sooner
did
*NL*
mamma
hear
me
say
this
than
she
nearly
fainted

*NL*
*NL*
A
strange
thought
passed
through
the
prince
's
brain
;
he
gazed
intently
*NL*
at
Aglaya
and
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
believe
that
this
was
the
same
haughty
young
girl
who
had
*NL*
once
so
proudly
shown
him
Gania
's
letter
.
He
could
not
understand
how
*NL*
that
proud
and
austere
beauty
could
show
herself
to
be
such
an
utter
*NL*
child
--
a
child
who
probably
did
not
even
now
understand
some
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
always
lived
at
home
,
Aglaya
Ivanovna
?
''
he
asked
.
``
I
mean
,
*NL*
have
you
never
been
to
school

or
college

anything

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

never

nowhere

all
my

corked
up
in
a

bottle
;
and
they
expect
me
to
be
married
straight
out
of
it
.
What
are
*NL*
you
laughing
at
again
?
I
observe
that
you
,
too
,
have
taken
to
laughing
*NL*
at
me
,
and
range
yourself
on
their
side
against
me

she
added
,
frowning
*NL*
angrily
.
``
Do

bad
enough

full
belief

with
annoyance

rather
confused

cried
Aglaya

her
lower
lip
trembled
violently

enter

innocent

I
am
certain

*NL*
*NL*
Aglaya
sat
with
her
eyes
on
the
ground

she
seemed
to
have
alarmed
even
*NL*
herself
by
what
she
had
said

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

went
straight
from

at
what
was

perhaps
the
most
painful

*NL*
``
Well

she
said

quite
in
a
different
tone

*NL*
She
was
remorseful
now
,
and
bent
forward
to
touch
his
shoulder
,
though
*NL*
still
trying
not
to
look
him
in
the
face
,
as
if
the
more
persuasively
*NL*
to
beg
him
not
to
be
angry
with
her
.
``
Very
well

''
she
continued
,
looking
*NL*
thoroughly
ashamed
of
herself
,
``
I
feel
that
I
said

forgive

all

the

softly

looking
at

again

cried

with
another
burst
of
indignation

living
in

horrible

*NL*
She
did
not
blush
as
she
said
this
;
on
the
contrary

she
grew
pale
,
*NL*
and
started
from
her
seat
,
apparently
oblivious
of
what
she
did
,
and
*NL*
immediately
sat
down
again
.
Her
lip
continued
to
tremble
for
a
long
*NL*
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
silence
for
a
moment
.
The
prince
was
taken
aback
by
the
*NL*
suddenness
of
this
last
reply
,
and
did
not
know
to
what
he
should
*NL*
attribute
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do

love
you
a

she
said
suddenly
,
just
as
though
the
words
*NL*
had
exploded
from
her
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
did
not
answer
,

there
was
silence
again

``

she
said

quickly

hardly
audibly

with

bent
lower
than

*NL*
*NL*
``

the

in

equally
low

``
What

than
his
life
.
He
let
his
hand
burn
before
my
very
eyes
in
*NL*
order
to
prove
to
me
that
he
loved
me
better
than
his
life
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
burned
his
hand

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

it

not

It
's
all
the

to
me
!

*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
sat
silent
once
more
.
Aglaya
did
not
seem
to
be
joking
;
she
*NL*
was
too
angry
for
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
he
brought
a
candle
with
him
to
this
place
?
That
is
,
if
the
*NL*
episode
happened
here
;
otherwise
I
ca
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
a
candle
!
What
's
there
improbable
about
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
whole
one
,
and
in
a
candlestick
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

no-half
a
candle

an
end

you
know

was
a
whole
candle

*NL*
it
's
all
the
same
.
Be
quiet
,
ca
n't
you
!
He
brought
a
box
of
matches
too
,
*NL*
if
you
like
,
and
then
lighted
the
candle
and
held
his
finger
in
it
for
*NL*
half
an
hour
and
more
!
--
There
!
Ca
n't
that
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
saw
him
yesterday
,
and
his
fingers
were
all
right
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Aglaya
suddenly
burst
out
laughing
,
as
simply
as
a
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
why
I
have
just
told
you
these
lies
?
''
She
appealed
to
the
*NL*
prince
,
of
a
sudden
,
with
the
most
childlike
candour
,
and
with
the
*NL*
laugh
still
trembling
on
her
lips
.
``
Because
when
one
tells
a
lie
,
if
one
*NL*
insists
on
something
unusual
and
eccentric
--
something
too
`
out
of
the
*NL*
way
''
for
anything
,
you
know
--
the
more
impossible
the
thing
is
,
the
more
*NL*
plausible
does
the
lie
sound
.
I
've
noticed
this
.
But
I
managed
it
badly
;
*NL*
I
did
n't
know
how
to
work
it
.
''
She
suddenly
frowned
again
at
this
point
*NL*
as
though
at
some
sudden
unpleasant
recollection
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
''
--
she
began
,
looking
seriously
and
even
sadly
at
him
--
``
if
when
I
*NL*
read
you
all
that
about
the
`
poor
knight
,
'
I
wished
to-to
praise
you
*NL*
for
one
thing
--
I
also
wished
to
show
you
that
I
knew
all
--
and
did
not
*NL*
approve
of
your
conduct
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very
unfair
to
me
,
and
to
that
unfortunate
woman
of
whom
you
*NL*
spoke
just
now
in
such
dreadful
terms
,
Aglaya
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
know
all

all

and
that
is
why
I
speak
so

I
know
very
well
*NL*
how
you
--
half
a
year
since
--
offered
her
your
hand
before
everybody
.
*NL*
Do
n't
interrupt
me
.
You
see
,
I
am
merely
stating
facts
without
any
*NL*
comment
upon
them
.
After
that
she
ran
away
with
Rogojin
.
Then
you
lived
*NL*
with
her
at
some
village
or
town
,
and
she
ran
away
from
you
.
''
-LRB-
Aglaya
*NL*
blushed
dreadfully
.
-RRB-
``
Then
she
returned
to
Rogojin
again
,
who
loves
*NL*
her
like
a
madman
.
Then
you
--
like
a
wise
man
as
you
are
--
came
back
here
*NL*
after
her
as
soon
as
ever
you
heard
that
she
had
returned
to
Petersburg
.
*NL*
Yesterday
evening
you
sprang
forward
to
protect
her
,
and
just
now
you
*NL*
dreamed
about
her
.
You
see
,
I
know
all
.
You
did
come
back
here
for
her
,
*NL*
for
her
--
now
did
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
for
her
!
''
said
the
prince
softly
and
sadly
,
and
bending
his
head
*NL*
down
,
quite
unconscious
of
the
fact
that
Aglaya
was
gazing
at
him
with
*NL*
eyes
which
burned
like
live
coals
.
``
I
came
to
find
out
something
--
I
*NL*
do
n't
believe
in
her
future
happiness
as
Rogojin
's
wife
,
although
--
in
a
*NL*
word
,
I
did
not
know
how
to
help
her
or
what
to
do
for
her
--
but
I
came
,
*NL*
on
the
chance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
glanced
at
Aglaya
,
who
was
listening
with
a
look
of
hatred
on
her
*NL*
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
came
without
knowing
why
,
I
suppose
you
love
her
very
much
*NL*
indeed
!

she
said
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
the
prince
,
``
no
,
I
do
not
love
her
.
Oh
!
if
you
only
knew
with
*NL*
what
horror
I
recall
the
time
I
spent
with
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
shudder
seemed
to
sweep
over
his
whole
body
at
the
recollection
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
about
it
,
''
said
Aglaya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
nothing
which
you
might
not
hear
.
Why
I
should
wish
to
tell
*NL*
you
,
and
only
you
,
this
experience
of
mine
,
I
really
can
not
say
;
*NL*
perhaps
it
really
is
because
I
love
you
very
much
.
This
unhappy
woman
is
*NL*
persuaded
that
she
is
the
most
hopeless
,
fallen
creature
in
the
world
.
*NL*
Oh
,
do
not
condemn
her
!
Do
not
cast
stones
at
her
!
She
has
suffered
too
*NL*
much
already
in
the
consciousness
of
her
own
undeserved
shame
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
she
is
not
guilty
--
oh
God
!
--
Every
moment
she
bemoans
and
bewails
*NL*
herself
,
and
cries
out
that
she
does
not
admit
any
guilt
,
that
she
is
*NL*
the
victim
of
circumstances
--
the
victim
of
a
wicked
libertine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
whatever
she
may
say
,
remember
that
she
does
not
believe
it
*NL*
herself

remember
that
she
will
believe
nothing
but
that
she
is
a
*NL*
guilty
creature
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
tried
to
rid
her
soul
of
this
gloomy
fallacy
,
she
suffered
so
*NL*
terribly
that
my
heart
will
never
be
quite
at
peace
so
long
as
I
can
*NL*
remember
that
dreadful
time
!
--
Do
you
know
why
she
left
me
?
Simply
to
*NL*
prove
to
me
what
is
not
true
--
that
she
is
base
.
But
the
worst
of
it
is
,
*NL*
she
did
not
realize
herself
that
that
was
all
she
wanted
to
prove
by
*NL*
her
departure
!
She
went
away
in
response
to
some
inner
prompting
to
*NL*
do
something
disgraceful
,
in
order
that
she
might
say
to
*NL*
herself
--
`
There
--
you
've
done
a
new
act
of
shame
--
you
degraded
creature
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Aglaya
--
perhaps
you
can
not
understand
all
this
.
Try
to
realize
that
*NL*
in
the
perpetual
admission
of
guilt
she
probably
finds
some
dreadful
*NL*
unnatural
satisfaction
--
as
though
she
were
revenging
herself
upon
*NL*
someone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
and
then
I
was
able
to
persuade
her
almost
to
see
light
around
*NL*
her
again
;
but
she
would
soon
fall
,
once
more
,
into
her
old
tormenting
*NL*
delusions
,
and
would
go
so
far
as
to
reproach
me
for
placing
myself
on
a
*NL*
pedestal
above
her
-LRB-
I
never
had
an
idea
of
such
a
thing

-RRB-
,
and
informed
*NL*
me
,
in
reply
to
my
proposal
of
marriage

that
she

not

condescending
sympathy

You
saw
her
last
night

do

can
be
happy
among

people

have
no

well-educated

astonished
me

sometimes

you
preached
her
sermons
there

you

the
prince
thoughtfully

not
noticing
Aglaya

mocking
tone

I
was
almost
always
silent
there

too

remind

hid
his
face
in

Aglaya
took
three
letters
out
of
her
pocket

threw
them
down
before
the
prince

-RRB-
``
For
a

shuddered
;
his
heart
seemed
to
freeze
within
him

He
gazed

at

wonderment

after
what
I
have
been
through
!
No
,
no
,
it
is
*NL*
not
love
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
pale
you
have
grown
!
''
cried
Aglaya
in
alarm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
's
nothing
.
I
have
n't
slept
,
that
's
all
,
and
I
'm
rather
tired
.
*NL*
I
--
we
certainly
did
talk
about
you
,
Aglaya
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
indeed
,
it
is
true
then
!
_
You
could
actually
talk
about
me
with
her
_
;
*NL*
and
--
and
how
could
you
have
been
fond
of
me
when
you
had
only
seen
me
*NL*
once
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
Perhaps
it
was
that
I
seemed
to
come
upon
light
in
the
*NL*
midst
of
my
gloom
.
I
told
you
the
truth
when
I
said
I
did
not
know
why
I
*NL*
thought
of
you
before
all
others
.
Of
course
it
was
all
a
sort
of
dream
,
*NL*
a
dream
amidst
the
horrors
of
reality
.
Afterwards
I
began
to
work
.
I
did
*NL*
not
intend
to
come
back
here
for
two
or
three
years
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
came
for
her
sake
?
''
Aglaya
's
voice
trembled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
came
for
her
sake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
moment
or
two
of
gloomy
silence
.
Aglaya
rose
from
her
seat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
say
,
''
she
began
in
shaky
tones
,
``
if
you
say
that
this
woman
*NL*
of
yours
is
mad
--
at
all
events
I
have
nothing
to
do
with
her
insane
*NL*
fancies
.
Kindly
take
these
three
letters
,
Lef
Nicolaievitch
,
and
throw
*NL*
them
back
to
her
,
from
me
.
And
if
she
dares
,
''
cried
Aglaya
suddenly
,
*NL*
much
louder
than
before
,
``
if
she
dares
so
much
as
write
me
one
word
*NL*
again
,
tell
her
I
shall
tell
my
father
,
and
that
she
shall
be
taken
to
a
*NL*
lunatic
asylum
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
jumped
up
in
alarm
at
Aglaya
's
sudden
wrath
,
and
a
mist
*NL*
seemed
to
come
before
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
not
really
feel
like
that
!
You
do
n't
mean
what
you
say
.
It
is
*NL*
not
true
,
''
he
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
_
is
_
true
,
it
_
is
_
true
,
''
cried
Aglaya
,
almost
beside
herself
*NL*
with
rage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
true
?
What
's
all
this
?
What
's
true
?
''
said
an
alarmed
voice
just
*NL*
beside
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
them
stood
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
it
's
true
that
I
am
going
to
marry
Gavrila
Ardalionovitch
,
that
I
*NL*
love
him
and
intend
to
elope
with
him
tomorrow
,
''
cried
Aglaya
,
turning
*NL*
upon
her
mother
.
``
Do
you
hear
?
Is
your
curiosity
satisfied
?
Are
you
*NL*
pleased
with
what
you
have
heard
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Aglaya
rushed
away
homewards
with
these
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
H
'm
!
well
,
_
you
_
are
not
going
away
just
yet
,
my
friend
,
at
all
events
,
''
*NL*
said
Lizabetha
,
stopping
the
prince
.
``
Kindly
step
home
with
me
,
and
let
*NL*
me
have
a
little
explanation
of
the
mystery
.
Nice
goings
on
,
these
!
I
*NL*
have
n't
slept
a
wink
all
night
as
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
followed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
IX
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arrived
at
her
house
,
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
paused
in
the
first
room
.
*NL*
She
could
go
no
farther
,
and
subsided
on
to
a
couch
quite
exhausted
;
too
*NL*
feeble
to
remember
so
much
as
to
ask
the
prince
to
take
a
seat
.
This
was
*NL*
a
large
reception-room
,
full
of
flowers
,
and
with
a
glass
door
leading
*NL*
into
the
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
and
Adelaida
came
in
almost
immediately
,
and
looked
*NL*
inquiringly
at
the
prince
and
their
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
girls
generally
rose
at
about
nine
in
the
morning
in
the
country
;
*NL*
Aglaya
,
of
late
,
had
been
in
the
habit
of
getting
up
rather
earlier
and
*NL*
having
a
walk
in
the
garden
,
but
not
at
seven
o'clock
;
about
eight
or
a
*NL*
little
later
was
her
usual
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
,
who
really
had
not
slept
all
night
,
rose
at
about
*NL*
eight
on
purpose
to
meet
Aglaya
in
the
garden
and
walk
with
her
;
but
she
*NL*
could
not
find
her
either
in
the
garden
or
in
her
own
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
agitated
the
old
lady
considerably
;
and
she
awoke
her
other
*NL*
daughters
.
Next
,
she
learned
from
the
maid
that
Aglaya
had
gone
into
*NL*
the
park
before
seven
o'clock
.
The
sisters
made
a
joke
of
Aglaya
's
last
*NL*
freak
,
and
told
their
mother
that
if
she
went
into
the
park
to
look
*NL*
for
her
,
Aglaya
would
probably
be
very
angry
with
her
,
and
that
she
was
*NL*
pretty
sure
to
be
sitting
reading
on
the
green
bench
that
she
had
talked
*NL*
of
two
or
three
days
since
,
and
about
which
she
had
nearly
quarrelled
*NL*
with
Prince
S.
,
who
did
not
see
anything
particularly
lovely
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arrived
at
the
rendezvous
of
the
prince
and
her
daughter
,
and
hearing
*NL*
the
strange
words
of
the
latter
,
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
had
been
*NL*
dreadfully
alarmed
,
for
many
reasons
.
However
,
now
that
she
had
dragged
*NL*
the
prince
home
with
her
,
she
began
to
feel
a
little
frightened
at
what
*NL*
she
had
undertaken
.
Why
should
not
Aglaya
meet
the
prince
in
the
*NL*
park
and
have
a
talk
with
him
,
even
if
such
a
meeting
should
be
by
*NL*
appointment
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
suppose
,
prince
,
''
she
began
,
bracing
herself
up
for
the
effort
,
*NL*
``
do
n't
suppose
that
I
have
brought
you
here
to
ask
questions
.
After
last
*NL*
night
,
I
assure
you
,
I
am
not
so
exceedingly
anxious
to
see
you
at
all
;
*NL*
I
could
have
postponed
the
pleasure
for
a
long
while
.
''
She
paused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
at
the
same
time
you
would
be
very
glad
to
know
how
I
happened
to
*NL*
meet
Aglaya
Ivanovna
this
morning
?
''
The
prince
finished
her
speech
for
*NL*
her
with
the
utmost
composure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
then
?
Supposing
I
should
like
to
know
?
''
cried
Lizabetha
*NL*
Prokofievna
,
blushing
.
``
I
'm
sure
I
am
not
afraid
of
plain
speaking
.
I
'm
*NL*
not
offending
anyone
,
and
I
never
wish
to
,
and
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
me
,
it
is
no
offence
to
wish
to
know
this
;
you
are
her
*NL*
mother
.
We
met
at
the
green
bench
this
morning
,
punctually
at
seven
*NL*
o'clock
,
--
according
to
an
agreement
made
by
Aglaya
Ivanovna
with
myself
*NL*
yesterday
.
She
said
that
she
wished
to
see
me
and
speak
to
me
about
*NL*
something
important
.
We
met
and
conversed
for
an
hour
about
matters
*NL*
concerning
Aglaya
Ivanovna
herself
,
and
that
's
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
it
is
all
,
my
friend
.
I
do
n't
doubt
you
for
a
moment
,
''
said
*NL*
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
with
dignity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
done
,
prince
,
capital
!
''
cried
Aglaya
,
who
entered
the
room
at
*NL*
this
moment
.
``
Thank
you
for
assuming
that
I
would
not
demean
myself
*NL*
with
lies
.
Come
,
is
that
enough
,
mamma
,
or
do
you
intend
to
put
any
more
*NL*
questions
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
I
have
never
needed
to
blush
before
you
,
up
to
this
day
,
*NL*
though
perhaps
you
would
have
been
glad
enough
to
make
me
,
''
said
*NL*
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
,
--
with
majesty
.
``
Good-bye
,
prince
;
forgive
me
for
*NL*
bothering
you
.
I
trust
you
will
rest
assured
of
my
unalterable
esteem
*NL*
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
made
his
bows
and
retired
at
once
.
Alexandra
and
Adelaida
*NL*
smiled
and
whispered
to
each
other
,
while
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
glared
*NL*
severely
at
them
.
``
We
are
only
laughing
at
the
prince
's
beautiful
bows
,
*NL*
mamma
,
''
said
Adelaida
.
``
Sometimes
he
bows
just
like
a
meal-sack
,
but
*NL*
to-day
he
was
like
--
like
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
the
_
heart
_
which
is
the
best
teacher
of
refinement
and
dignity
,
*NL*
not
the
dancing-master
,
''
said
her
mother
,
sententiously
,
and
departed
*NL*
upstairs
to
her
own
room
,
not
so
much
as
glancing
at
Aglaya
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
prince
reached
home
,
about
nine
o'clock
,
he
found
Vera
Lebedeff
*NL*
and
the
maid
on
the
verandah
.
They
were
both
busy
trying
to
tidy
up
the
*NL*
place
after
last
night
's
disorderly
party
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
goodness
,
we
've
just
managed
to
finish
it
before
you
came
in
!
''
*NL*
said
Vera
,
joyfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-morning
!
My
head
whirls
so
;
I
did
n't
sleep
all
night

I
should
*NL*
like
to
have
a
nap
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
on
the
verandah
?
Very
well
,
I
'll
tell
them
all
not
to
come
and
*NL*
wake
you
.
Papa
has
gone
out
somewhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
servant
left
the
room
.
Vera
was
about
to
follow
her
,
but
returned
*NL*
and
approached
the
prince
with
a
preoccupied
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Prince
!
''
she
said
,
``
have
pity
on
that
poor
boy
;
do
n't
turn
him
out
*NL*
today
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
for
the
world
;
he
shall
do
just
as
he
likes

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
wo
n't
do
any
harm
now

and

and
do
n't
be
too
severe
with
him

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
dear
no
!
Why
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
--
and
you
wo
n't
_
laugh
_
at
him
?
That
's
the
chief
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
!
Never
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
foolish
I
am
to
speak
of
such
things
to
a
man
like
you
,
''
said
Vera
,
*NL*
blushing
.
``
Though
you
_
do
_
look
tired
,
''
she
added
,
half
turning
away
,
*NL*
``
your
eyes
are
so
splendid
at
this
moment
--
so
full
of
happiness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
?
''
asked
the
prince
,
gleefully
,
and
he
laughed
in
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Vera
,
simple-minded
little
girl
that
she
was
-LRB-
just
like
a
boy
,
in
*NL*
fact
-RRB-
,
here
became
dreadfully
confused
,
of
a
sudden
,
and
ran
hastily
out
*NL*
of
the
room
,
laughing
and
blushing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
dear
little
thing
she
is
,
''
thought
the
prince
,
and
immediately
*NL*
forgot
all
about
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
to
the
far
end
of
the
verandah
,
where
the
sofa
stood
,
with
*NL*
a
table
in
front
of
it
.
Here
he
sat
down
and
covered
his
face
with
his
*NL*
hands
,
and
so
remained
for
ten
minutes
.
Suddenly
he
put
his
hand
in
his
*NL*
coat-pocket
and
hurriedly
produced
three
letters
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
door
opened
again
,
and
out
came
Colia
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
actually
felt
glad
that
he
had
been
interrupted
,
--
and
might
*NL*
return
the
letters
to
his
pocket
.
He
was
glad
of
the
respite
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Colia
,
plunging
in
medias
res
,
as
he
always
did
,
``
here
's
*NL*
a
go
!
What
do
you
think
of
Hippolyte
now
?
Do
n't
respect
him
any
longer
,
*NL*
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
But
look
here
,
Colia

I
'm
tired
;
besides
,
the
subject
is
too
*NL*
melancholy
to
begin
upon
again
.
How
is
he
,
though
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Asleep

he
'll
sleep
for
a
couple
of
hours
yet

I
quite
*NL*
understand

you
have
n't
slept

you
walked
about
the
park
,
I
know

*NL*
Agitation

excitement

all
that
sort

quite
natural

too
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
know
I
walked
in
the
park
and
did
n't
sleep
at
home

*NL*
*NL*
``
Vera
just
told
me

She
tried
to
persuade
me
not
to
come

I
could
n't
*NL*
help
myself
,
just
for
one
minute
.
I
have
been
having
my
turn
at
the
*NL*
bedside
for
the
last
two
hours
;
Kostia
Lebedeff
is
there
now
.
Burdovsky
*NL*
has
gone
.
Now

lie
down

make
yourself
comfortable

sleep

well

I
'm
awfully
impressed

you
know

*NL*
*NL*
``
Naturally
,
all
this
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
I
mean
with
the
`
explanation
,
'
especially
that
part
of
it
where
*NL*
he
talks
about
Providence
and
a
future
life
.
There
is
a
gigantic
thought
*NL*
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
gazed
affectionately
at
Colia
,
who
,
of
course
,
had
come
in
*NL*
solely
for
the
purpose
of
talking
about
this
``
gigantic
thought
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
is
not
any
one
particular
thought
,
only
;
it
is
the
general
*NL*
circumstances
of
the
case

If
Voltaire
had
written
this
now
,
or
*NL*
Rousseau
,
I
should
have
just
read
it
and
thought
it
remarkable
,
but
*NL*
should
not
have
been
so
_
impressed
_
by
it
.
But
a
man
who
knows
for
*NL*
certain
that
he
has
but
ten
minutes
to
live
and
can
talk
like
*NL*
that
--
why
--
it
's
--
it
's
_
pride
_
,
that
is
!
It
is
really
a
most
extraordinary
,
*NL*
exalted
assertion
of
personal
dignity

it
's
--
it
's
_
defiant
!

What
a
*NL*
_
gigantic

strength
of
will
,
eh
?
And
to
accuse
a
fellow
like
that
of
not
*NL*
putting
in
the
cap
on
purpose
;
it
's
base
and
mean
!
You
know
he
deceived
*NL*
us
last
night
,
the
cunning
rascal
.
I
never
packed
his
bag
for
him
,
and
*NL*
I
never
saw
his
pistol
.
He
packed
it
himself
.
But
he
put
me
off
my
guard
*NL*
like
that
,
you
see
.
Vera
says
you
are
going
to
let
him
stay
on
;
I
swear
*NL*
there
's
no
danger
,
especially
as
we
are
always
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
was
by
him
at
night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
,
and
Burdovsky
,
and
Kostia
Lebedeff
.
Keller
stayed
a
little
while
,
*NL*
and
then
went
over
to
Lebedeff
's
to
sleep
.
Ferdishenko
slept
at
*NL*
Lebedeff
's
,
too
;
but
he
went
away
at
seven
o'clock
.
My
father
is
always
*NL*
at
Lebedeff
's
;
but
he
has
gone
out
just
now
.
I
dare
say
Lebedeff
will
be
*NL*
coming
in
here
directly
;
he
has
been
looking
for
you
;
I
do
n't
know
what
*NL*
he
wants
.
Shall
we
let
him
in
or
not
,
if
you
are
asleep
?
I
'm
going
to
*NL*
have
a
nap
,
too
.
By-the-by
,
such
a
curious
thing
happened
.
Burdovsky
*NL*
woke
me
at
seven
,
and
I
met
my
father
just
outside
the
room
,
so
drunk
,
*NL*
he
did
n't
even
know
me
.
He
stood
before
me
like
a
log
,
and
when
he
*NL*
recovered
himself
,
asked
hurriedly
how
Hippolyte
was
.
`
Yes
,
'
he
said
,
*NL*
when
I
told
him
,
`
that
's
all
very
well
,
but
I
_
really
_
came
to
warn
you
*NL*
that
you
must
be
very
careful
what
you
say
before
Ferdishenko
.
'
Do
you
*NL*
follow
me
,
prince
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

Is
it
really
so

However

it

all
the

to
us

of
course

*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
it
is
;
we
are
not

and
that
being
the

all
the
more
curious
that
the

have
been
on

wake

up
in

tell

went

He
came
into
the
room
on
his

out
;
I
*NL*
was
watching
just
then
.
He
said
he
was
going

spend

there
's
a

Well

off

Oh

The

just
go
away
again

*NL*
``
One

absolutely
speak

Lebedeff

mysteriously

solemnly

entering

looking
extremely
important

He
had

just
returned

carried
his

He
looked
*NL*
preoccupied

most
unusually
dignified

*NL*
The
prince
begged
him
to
take
a
chair

*NL*

Lebedeff

to

I
confess
to
you

as

would
to
Providence
itself

Yesterday
I
received
four
hundred
roubles

from
a

at
about
five
in
the
afternoon
,
and
came
down
here
by

I
had
my
purse
in
my
pocket

When
I
changed

I
put
the
money

into

pocket
of
my
plain
clothes
,
intending
to
keep
it
by

I

have
an
applicant
for
it
in
the
evening

*NL*

It

Yes

at

*NL*
``
Quite

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

meanwhile
that
sick

was
brought
here

those
guests
came
*NL*
in
,
and
we
had
tea
,
and
--
well
,
we
made
merry
--
to
my
ruin
!
Hearing
of
*NL*
your
birthday
afterwards
,
and
excited
with
the
circumstances
of
the
*NL*
evening
,
I
ran
upstairs
and
changed
my
plain
clothes
once
more
for
my
*NL*
uniform

Service

Russia

uniform

-RSB-

you
must
have
*NL*
noticed

had
my

on
all
the
evening

Well
,
I
forgot
the
money
in
*NL*
the
pocket
of
my
old
coat
--
you
know
when
God
will
ruin
a
man
he
first
*NL*
of
all
bereaves
him
of
his
senses

and
it
was
only
this
morning
at
*NL*
half-past
seven
that
I
woke
up
and
grabbed
at
my
coat
pocket
,
first
*NL*
thing
.
The
pocket
was
empty

the
purse
gone
,
and
not
a
trace
to
be
*NL*
found
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
me

This
is
very
unpleasant

*NL*
``
Unpleasant

Indeed
it
is

You
have
found
a
very
appropriate

Lebedeff

politely
,

with
sarcasm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
's
to
be
done
?
It
's
a
serious
matter

thoughtfully

Do

may

dropped
it
out

intoxicated

``
Certainly

Anything
is
possible

you
neatly
*NL*
express
it

consider
--
if
I
,
intoxicated
or
not
,
dropped
an
*NL*
object
out
of
my
pocket
on
to
the
ground

that
object
ought

remain
on
*NL*
the
ground

Where

the
object

Did

you
put
it
away
in

drawer

perhaps
?

looked
everywhere

turned
out
everything

disturbs
me
a
good

up

taken
it
out

Most
undoubtedly

excellent

you

hit
it

wringing
his

out
about

That
is
a
very
difficult

complicated

was
in
the
kitchen
the
whole
evening

it

either
at

One

``
Well

there
are
three
left

Keller

He
is

to

,
and
a
liberal
-LRB-
in
the
sense

-RRB-
,
*NL*
otherwise
with
more
of
the
ancient
knight
about
him
than
of
the
modern
*NL*
liberal
.
He
was
with
the
sick
man
at
first
,
but
came
over
afterwards
*NL*
because
there
was
no
place
to
lie
down
in
the
room
and
the
floor
was
so
*NL*
hard

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
suspect
him
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
_
did

suspect
him

When
I
woke
up
at
half-past
seven
and
tore
my
hair
*NL*
in
despair
for
my
loss
and
carelessness
,
I
awoke
the
general
,
who
was
*NL*
sleeping
the
sleep
of
innocence
near
me

Taking
into
consideration
the
*NL*
sudden
disappearance
of
Ferdishenko
,
which
was
suspicious
in
itself
,
we
*NL*
decided
to
search
Keller
,
who
was
lying
there
sleeping
like
a
top
.
Well
,
*NL*
we
searched
his
clothes
thoroughly
,
and
not
a
farthing
did
we
find
;
in
*NL*
fact
,
his
pockets
all
had
holes
in
them
.
We
found
a
dirty
handkerchief
,
*NL*
and
a
love-letter
from
some
scullery-maid
.
The
general
decided
that
he
*NL*
was
innocent
.
We
awoke
him
for
further
inquiries
,
and
had
the
greatest
*NL*
difficulty
in
making
him
understand
what
was
up
.
He
opened
his
mouth
and
*NL*
stared
--
he
looked
so
stupid
and
so
absurdly
innocent
.
It
was
n't
Keller
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'm
so
glad

said
the
prince

joyfully

``
I
was
so
afraid

*NL*
*NL*
``
Afraid

Then
you
had
some
grounds
for
supposing

might
be
the

culprit

Lebedeff
,
frowning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no

not
a
bit

foolish

was
afraid

cared
to
know
that
he
was
going
to
Wilkin
's
?
No
,
no
!
prince
,
this
is
*NL*
finesse
,
thieves

finesse
!
This
is
as
good
as
saying
,
`
There
,
how
can
I
*NL*
be
a
thief
when
I
leave
my
address
?
I
'm
not
concealing
my
movements
as
a
*NL*
thief
would
.

Do
you
understand
,
prince
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
but
that
is
not
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Second
proof
.
The
scent
turns
out
to
be
false
,
and
the
address
given
*NL*
is
a
sham
.
An
hour
after
--
that
is
at
about
eight
,
I
went
to
Wilkin
's
*NL*
myself
,
and
there
was
no
trace
of
Ferdishenko
.
The
maid
did
tell
me
,
*NL*
certainly
,
that
an
hour
or
so
since
someone
had
been
hammering
at
the
*NL*
door
,
and
had
smashed
the
bell
;
she
said
she
would
not
open
the
door
*NL*
because
she
did
n't
want
to
wake
her
master
;
probably
she
was
too
lazy
to
*NL*
get
up
herself
.
Such
phenomena
are
met
with
occasionally
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
is
that
all
your
evidence
?
It
is
not
enough
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
prince
,
whom
are
we
to
suspect
,
then
?
Consider
!
''
said
Lebedeff
*NL*
with
almost
servile
amiability
,
smiling
at
the
prince
.
There
was
a
look
*NL*
of
cunning
in
his
eyes
,
however
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
search
your
room
and
all
the
cupboards
again
,
''
said
the
*NL*
prince
,
after
a
moment
or
two
of
silent
reflection
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
have
done
so
,
my
dear
prince
!
''
said
Lebedeff
,
more
sweetly
than
*NL*
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
H
'm
!
why
must
you
needs
go
up
and
change
your
coat
like
that
?
''
asked
*NL*
the
prince
,
banging
the
table
with
his
fist
,
in
annoyance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
n't
be
so
worried
on
my
account
,
prince
!
I
assure
you
I
am
not
*NL*
worth
it
!
At
least
,
not
I
alone
.
But
I
see
you
are
suffering
on
behalf
*NL*
of
the
criminal
too
,
for
wretched
Ferdishenko
,
in
fact
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
you
have
given
me
a
disagreeable
enough
thing
to
think
*NL*
about
,
''
said
the
prince
,
irritably
,
``
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
,
since
*NL*
you
are
so
sure
it
was
Ferdishenko
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
who
else
_
could
_
it
be
,
my
very
dear
prince
?
''
repeated
Lebedeff
,
as
*NL*
sweet
as
sugar
again
.
``
If
you
do
n't
wish
me
to
suspect
Mr.
Burdovsky
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
the
general
?
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
!
''
said
the
prince
,
angrily
,
turning
round
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
so
,
nonsense
!
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
dear
me
!
He
did
amuse
me
,
did
the
*NL*
general
!
We
went
off
on
the
hot
scent
to
Wilkin
's
together
,
you
know
;
*NL*
but
I
must
first
observe
that
the
general
was
even
more
thunderstruck
*NL*
than
I
myself
this
morning
,
when
I
awoke
him
after
discovering
the
*NL*
theft
;
so
much
so
that
his
very
face
changed
--
he
grew
red
and
then
pale
,
*NL*
and
at
length
flew
into
a
paroxysm
of
such
noble
wrath
that
I
assure
you
*NL*
I
was
quite
surprised
!
He
is
a
most
generous-hearted
man
!
He
tells
lies
*NL*
by
the
thousands
,
I
know
,
but
it
is
merely
a
weakness
;
he
is
a
man
of
*NL*
the
highest
feelings
;
a
simple-minded
man
too
,
and
a
man
who
carries
the
*NL*
conviction
of
innocence
in
his
very
appearance
.
I
love
that
man
,
sir
;
I
*NL*
may
have
told
you
so
before
;
it
is
a
weakness
of
mine
.
Well
--
he
suddenly
*NL*
stopped
in
the
middle
of
the
road
,
opened
out
his
coat
and
bared
his
*NL*
breast
.
`
Search
me
,
'
he
says
,
`
you
searched
Keller
;
why
do
n't
you
search
*NL*
me
too
?
It
is
only
fair
!
'
says
he
.
''
And
all
the
while
his
legs
and
hands
*NL*
were
trembling
with
anger
,
and
he
as
white
as
a
sheet
all
over
!
So
I
*NL*
said
to
him
,
``
Nonsense
,
general
;
if
anybody
but
yourself
had
said
that
*NL*
to
me
,
I
'd
have
taken
my
head
,
my
own
head
,
and
put
it
on
a
large
dish
*NL*
and
carried
it
round
to
anyone
who
suspected
you
;
and
I
should
have
*NL*
said
:
`
There
,
you
see
that
head
?
It
's
my
head
,
and
I
'll
go
bail
with
*NL*
that
head
for
him
!
Yes
,
and
walk
through
the
fire
for
him
,
too
.
There
,
'
*NL*
says
I
,
`
that
's
how
I
'd
answer
for
you
,
general
!
'
Then
he
embraced
me
,
*NL*
in
the
middle
of
the
street
,
and
hugged
me
so
tight
-LRB-
crying
over
me
all
*NL*
the
while
-RRB-
that
I
coughed
fit
to
choke
!
`
You
are
the
one
friend
left
to
*NL*
me
amid
all
my
misfortunes
,
'
says
he
.
Oh
,
he
's
a
man
of
sentiment
,
that
!
*NL*
He
went
on
to
tell
me
a
story
of
how
he
had
been
accused
,
or
suspected
,
*NL*
of
stealing
five
hundred
thousand
roubles
once
,
as
a
young
man
;
and
how
,
*NL*
the
very
next
day
,
he
had
rushed
into
a
burning
,
blazing
house
and
saved
*NL*
the
very
count
who
suspected
him
,
and
Nina
Alexandrovna
-LRB-
who
was
then
*NL*
a
young
girl
-RRB-
,
from
a
fiery
death
.
The
count
embraced
him
,
and
that
was
*NL*
how
he
came
to
marry
Nina
Alexandrovna
,
he
said
.
As
for
the
money
,
it
*NL*
was
found
among
the
ruins
next
day
in
an
English
iron
box
with
a
secret
*NL*
lock
;
it
had
got
under
the
floor
somehow
,
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
*NL*
fire
it
would
never
have
been
found
!
The
whole
thing
is
,
of
course
,
an
*NL*
absolute
fabrication
,
though
when
he
spoke
of
Nina
Alexandrovna
he
wept
!
*NL*
She
's
a
grand
woman
,
is
Nina
Alexandrovna
,
though
she
is
very
angry
with
*NL*
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
acquainted
with
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
hardly
at
all
.
I
wish
I
were
,
if
only
for
the
sake
of
justifying
*NL*
myself
in
her
eyes
.
Nina
Alexandrovna
has
a
grudge
against
me
for
,
as
*NL*
she
thinks
,
encouraging
her
husband
in
drinking
;
whereas
in
reality
I
*NL*
not
only
do
not
encourage
him
,
but
I
actually
keep
him
out
of
harm
's
*NL*
way
,
and
out
of
bad
company
.
Besides
,
he
's
my
friend
,
prince
,
so
that
*NL*
I
shall
not
lose
sight
of
him
,
again
.
Where
he
goes
,
I
go
.
He
's
quite
*NL*
given
up
visiting
the
captain
's
widow
,
though
sometimes
he
thinks
sadly
*NL*
of
her
,
especially
in
the
morning
,
when
he
's
putting
on
his
boots
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
why
it
's
at
that
time
.
But
he
has
no
money
,
and
it
's
no
*NL*
use
his
going
to
see
her
without
.
Has
he
borrowed
any
money
from
you
,
*NL*
prince
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
he
has
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
he
's
ashamed
to
!
He
_
meant
_
to
ask
you
,
I
know
,
for
he
said
so
.
I
*NL*
suppose
he
thinks
that
as
you
gave
him
some
once
-LRB-
you
remember
-RRB-
,
you
*NL*
would
probably
refuse
if
he
asked
you
again
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
ever
give
him
money
?

*NL*
*NL*
``

I
would
give
that
man
not
only
my
money
,
but
my
*NL*
very
life

if
he
wanted
it
.
Well
,
perhaps
that
's
exaggeration
;
not
life
,
*NL*
we
'll
say
,
but
some
illness
,
a
boil
or
a
bad
cough
,
or
anything
of
that
*NL*
sort
,
I
would
stand
with
pleasure

for
his
sake

I
consider
him
a

great
man
fallen

money

indeed

*NL*
*NL*
``
H

give

money

*NL*
*NL*
``
N-no

I
have
never
given
him
money
,

he
knows
well
that
I
will
never
*NL*

him
any
;
because
I
am
anxious
to
keep
him
out
of
intemperate

ways

He
is
going
to
town
with
me
now
;
for
you
must
know
I
am
off
to
*NL*
Petersburg
after
Ferdishenko
,
while
the
scent
is
hot
;
I
'm
certain
he
is
*NL*
there

I
shall
let
the
general
go
one
way

I
go
the
other

so
arranged
matters

pop
out
upon

going

naughty
old
general

catch
him

I
know
where

at
a
certain

house

I
think
it
will

be

with

widow

``
Oh

said
the

much
agitated

speaking
in
a
low
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

not

Oh

great
though
this
misfortune
be
to
myself

can
not

I

to
ask

I
confess

it

the
chief
object

clasped

*NL*
``
I
will
explain
my
idea

a
practical
example

to
make
it
clearer

You
*NL*
know
the
sort
of
man
he
is
.
At
present
his
only
failing
is
that
he
is
*NL*
crazy
about
that
captain

widow
,
and
he
can
not
go
to
her
without
*NL*
money

I
mean
to
catch
him
at

house
today

committed

some
very
dishonourable
action

he

call
generous

one
could

very
soft-hearted

Believe
me
,
he
would
betray
himself
*NL*
before
five
days
were
out
;
he
would
burst
into
tears
,
and
make
a
clean
*NL*
breast
of
the
matter
;
especially
if
managed
with
tact

you

watched

every
step

to
speak

Lebedeff
added
most
emphatically

drop

admit

debauchery

the

far

rising
;

with
an
unctuous
smile

Muishkin
frowned

rose
from
his
seat

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
Lebedeff
strained
his
eyes

ears
to
take
in
what
the

was
*NL*
saying

The
latter
was
frowning
more
and
more
,
and
walking
excitedly
up
*NL*
and
down
,
trying

Lebedeff

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

he
said
,
``
I
was
given
to
understand
that
Ferdishenko
was
that

sort
of
man

that
one

everything

One
has
to
take

care

too
much

you
understand

I
say
this
to
prove
that

*NL*
really
is

more
likely
to
have
done
this

anyone

The

not

Oh

altogether

I
am
very
*NL*
sorry
that
I
should
have
had
to
say
this

because
I
assure
you
I
do
n't
*NL*
believe
it
myself

it
is
all
nonsense

It
was
stupid
of
me

say
anything
about
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see

it
is
very
important

it
is
most
important
to
know
where
you

got
this
report
from

''
said
Lebedeff
,
excitedly
.
He
had
risen
from
his
*NL*
seat
,
and
was
trying
to
keep
step
with
the
prince
,
running
after
him
,
up
*NL*
and
down
.
``
Because
look
here
,
prince
,
I
do
n't
mind
telling
you
now
that
*NL*
as
we
were
going
along
to
Wilkin
's
this
morning
,
after
telling
me
what
*NL*
you
know
about
the
fire
,
and
saving
the
count
and
all
that
,
the
general
*NL*
was
pleased
to
drop
certain
hints
to
the
same
effect
about
Ferdishenko
,
*NL*
but
so
vaguely
and
clumsily
that
I
thought
better
to
put
a
few
questions
*NL*
to
him
on
the
matter
,
with
the
result
that
I
found
the
whole
thing
was
*NL*
an
invention
of
his
excellency
's
own
mind
.
Of
course
,
he
only
lies
with
*NL*
the
best
intentions
;
still
,
he
lies
.
But
,
such
being
the
case
,
where
*NL*
could
you
have
heard
the
same
report
?
It
was
the
inspiration
of
the
*NL*
moment
with
him
,
you
understand
,
so
who
could
have
told
_
you
?
_
It
is
an
*NL*
important
question
,
you
see
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
Colia
told
me
,
and
his
father
told
_
him
_
at
about
six
this
*NL*
morning
.
They
met
at
the
threshold
,
when
Colia
was
leaving
the
room
for
*NL*
something
or
other
.
''
The
prince
told
Lebedeff
all
that
Colia
had
made
*NL*
known
to
himself
,
in
detail
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
now
,
that
's
what
we
may
call

scent

''
said
Lebedeff
,
rubbing
his
*NL*
hands
and
laughing
silently
.
``
I
thought
it
must
be
so
,
you
see
.
The
*NL*
general
interrupted
his
innocent
slumbers
,
at
six
o'clock
,
in
order
*NL*
to
go
and
wake
his
beloved
son
,
and
warn
him
of
the
dreadful
danger
of
*NL*
companionship
with
Ferdishenko
.
Dear
me
!
what
a
dreadfully
dangerous
man
*NL*
Ferdishenko
must
be
,
and
what
touching
paternal
solicitude
,
on
the
part
*NL*
of
his
excellency

ha
!
ha
!

!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen

Lebedeff

''
began
the
prince
,
quite
overwhelmed
;

_
do

act
*NL*
quietly

do
n't
make
a
scandal

Lebedeff

cried
Lebedeff
,
in
a
*NL*
paroxysm
of
exaltation
.
``
I

give
every

Illustrious

am
a

deal
with

there
is
no

X

*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
understood
at
last
why
he
shivered
with
dread
every
time
*NL*
he
thought
of
the
three
letters
in
his
pocket
,
and
why
he
had
put
off
*NL*
reading
them
until
the
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
fell
into
a
heavy
sleep
on
the
sofa
on
the
verandah
,
without
*NL*
having
had
the
courage
to
open
a
single
one
of
the
three
envelopes
,
he
*NL*
again
dreamed
a
painful
dream
,
and
once
more
that
poor
,
``
sinful
''
woman
*NL*
appeared
to
him
.
Again
she
gazed
at
him
with
tears
sparkling
on
her
long
*NL*
lashes
,
and
beckoned
him
after
her
;
and
again
he
awoke
,
as
before
,
with
*NL*
the
picture
of
her
face
haunting
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
longed
to
get
up
and
go
to
her
at
once
--
but
he
_
could
not
_
.
At
length
,
*NL*
almost
in
despair
,
he
unfolded
the
letters
,
and
began
to
read
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
letters
,
too
,
were
like
a
dream
.
We
sometimes
have
strange
,
*NL*
impossible
dreams
,
contrary
to
all
the
laws
of
nature
.
When
we
awake
we
*NL*
remember
them
and
wonder
at
their
strangeness
.
You
remember
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
that
you
were
in
full
possession
of
your
reason
during
this
succession
*NL*
of
fantastic
images
;
even
that
you
acted
with
extraordinary
logic
and
*NL*
cunning
while
surrounded
by
murderers
who
hid
their
intentions
and
made
*NL*
great
demonstrations
of
friendship
,
while
waiting
for
an
opportunity
*NL*
to
cut
your
throat
.
You
remember
how
you
escaped
them
by
some
ingenious
*NL*
stratagem
;
then
you
doubted
if
they
were
really
deceived
,
or
whether
*NL*
they
were
only
pretending
not
to
know
your
hiding-place
;
then
you
*NL*
thought
of
another
plan
and
hoodwinked
them
once
again
.
You
remember
all
*NL*
this
quite
clearly
,
but
how
is
it
that
your
reason
calmly
accepted
all
*NL*
the
manifest
absurdities
and
impossibilities
that
crowded
into
your
*NL*
dream
?
One
of
the
murderers
suddenly
changed
into
a
woman
before
your
*NL*
very
eyes
;
then
the
woman
was
transformed
into
a
hideous
,
cunning
little
*NL*
dwarf
;
and
you
believed
it
,
and
accepted
it
all
almost
as
a
matter
of
*NL*
course
--
while
at
the
same
time
your
intelligence
seemed
unusually
keen
,
*NL*
and
accomplished
miracles
of
cunning
,
sagacity
,
and
logic
!
Why
is
it
*NL*
that
when
you
awake
to
the
world
of
realities
you
nearly
always
feel
,
*NL*
sometimes
very
vividly
,
that
the
vanished
dream
has
carried
with
it
some
*NL*
enigma
which
you
have
failed
to
solve
?
You
smile
at
the
extravagance
*NL*
of
your
dream
,
and
yet
you
feel
that
this
tissue
of
absurdity
contained
*NL*
some
real
idea
,
something
that
belongs
to
your
true
life
,
--
something
*NL*
that
exists
,
and
has
always
existed
,
in
your
heart
.
You
search
your
*NL*
dream
for
some
prophecy
that
you
were
expecting
.
It
has
left
a
deep
*NL*
impression
upon
you
,
joyful
or
cruel
,
but
what
it
means
,
or
what
has
*NL*
been
predicted
to
you
in
it
,
you
can
neither
understand
nor
remember
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reading
of
these
letters
produced
some
such
effect
upon
the
prince
.
*NL*
He
felt
,
before
he
even
opened
the
envelopes
,
that
the
very
fact
of
*NL*
their
existence
was
like
a
nightmare
.
How
could
she
ever
have
made
up
*NL*
her
mind
to
write
to
her
?
he
asked
himself
.
How
could
she
write
about
*NL*
that
at
all
?
And
how
could
such
a
wild
idea
have
entered
her
head
?
*NL*
And
yet
,
the
strangest
part
of
the
matter
was
,
that
while
he
read
the
*NL*
letters
,
he
himself
almost
believed
in
the
possibility
,
and
even
in
the
*NL*
justification
,
of
the
idea
he
had
thought
so
wild
.
Of
course
it
was
a
*NL*
mad
dream
,
a
nightmare
,
and
yet
there
was
something
cruelly
real
about
*NL*
it
.
For
hours
he
was
haunted
by
what
he
had
read
.
Several
passages
*NL*
returned
again
and
again
to
his
mind
,
and
as
he
brooded
over
them
,
he
*NL*
felt
inclined
to
say
to
himself
that
he
had
foreseen
and
known
all
that
*NL*
was
written
here
;
it
even
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
read
the
whole
of
*NL*
this
some
time
or
other
,
long
,
long
ago
;
and
all
that
had
tormented
and
*NL*
grieved
him
up
to
now
was
to
be
found
in
these
old
,
long
since
read
,
*NL*
letters
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
you

this

-LRB-
so
the
first
began
-RRB-

``

first
at

nothing

Were
I
in

*NL*
Farther
on
,
in
another
place
,
she
wrote
:
``
Do
not
consider
my
words

sickly
ecstasies

you
are

seen

I

``

she
wrote
in
another
of
the
letters

,
``

*NL*
I
couple
you

I

He
fell
in

he
saw

once

spoke

I
understood
without

that
you

I
lived
near
him
for
a
whole
month

I
understood

love

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
was
the
matter
yesterday

''
-LRB-
she
wrote
on
another
sheet
-RRB-
.
``
I
passed
*NL*
by
you
,
and
you
seemed
to
me
to
_
blush
_
.
Perhaps
it
was
only
my
fancy
.
*NL*
If
I
were
to
bring
you
to
the
most
loathsome
den
,
and
show
you
the
*NL*
revelation
of
undisguised
vice
--
you
should
not
blush
.
You
can
never
feel
*NL*
the
sense
of
personal
affront
.
You
may
hate
all
who
are
mean
,
or
base
,
*NL*
or
unworthy
--
but
not
for
yourself

only
for
those
whom
they
wrong

No

one
can
wrong
_
you

Do
you

I

you
ought
to
love
me

for
you
*NL*
are
the

in
his-you
are
as
light

An
angel
can
not
*NL*
hate
,
perhaps
can
not
love
,
either

I
often
ask
myself
--
is
it
possible
to
*NL*
love
everybody
?
Indeed
it
is
not
;
it
is
not
in
nature

Abstract
love
*NL*
of
humanity
is
nearly
always
love
of
self

But
you
are
different
.
You
*NL*
can
not
help
loving
all
,
since
you
can
compare
with
none
,
and
are
above
*NL*
all
personal
offence
or
anger
.
Oh
!
how
bitter
it
would
be
to
me
to
*NL*
know
that
you
felt
anger
or
shame
on
my
account
,
for
that
would
be
your
*NL*
fall
--
you
would
become
comparable
at
once
with
such
as
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yesterday
,
after
seeing
you
,
I
went
home
and
thought
out
a
picture

*NL*
*NL*
``
Artists
always
draw
the
Saviour
as
an
actor
in
one
of
the
Gospel
*NL*
stories
.
I
should
do
differently
.
I
should
represent
Christ
alone
--
the
*NL*
disciples
did
leave
Him
alone
occasionally
.
I
should
paint
one
little
*NL*
child
left
with
Him
.
This
child
has
been
playing
about
near
Him
,
and
*NL*
had
probably
just
been
telling
the
Saviour
something
in
its
pretty
*NL*
baby
prattle
.
Christ
had
listened
to
it
,
but
was
now
musing
--
one
*NL*
hand
reposing
on
the
child
's
bright
head
.
His
eyes
have
a
far-away
*NL*
expression
.
Thought
,
great
as
the
Universe
,
is
in
them
--
His
face
is
sad
.
*NL*
The
little
one
leans
its
elbow
upon
Christ
's
knee
,
and
with
its
cheek
*NL*
resting
on
its
hand
,
gazes
up
at
Him
,
pondering
as
children
sometimes
do
*NL*
ponder

The
sun
is
setting

There
you
have
my
picture

You
are
innocent

my
passion

you
,
or
that
I
belong
to
that
class
*NL*
of
people
who
take
a
satisfaction
in
humiliating
themselves
--
from
pride
.
*NL*
I
have
my
consolation
,
though
it
would
be
difficult
to
explain
it
--
but
I
*NL*
do
not
humiliate
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
I
wish
to
unite
you
two
?
For
your
sakes
or
my
own
?
For
my
own
*NL*
sake
,
naturally
.
All
the
problems
of
my
life
would
thus
be
solved
;
*NL*
I
have
thought
so
for
a
long
time
.
I
know
that
once
when
your
sister
*NL*
Adelaida
saw
my
portrait
she
said
that
such
beauty
could
overthrow
*NL*
the
world
.
But
I
have
renounced
the
world
.
You
think
it
strange
that
*NL*
I
should
say
so
,
for
you
saw
me
decked
with
lace
and
diamonds
,
in
the
*NL*
company
of
drunkards
and
wastrels
.
Take
no
notice
of
that
;
I
know
that
*NL*
I
have
almost
ceased
to
exist
.
God
knows
what
it
is
dwelling
within
me
*NL*
now
--
it
is
not
myself
.
I
can
see
it
every
day
in
two
dreadful
eyes
which
*NL*
are
always
looking
at
me
,
even
when
not
present
.
These
eyes
are
silent
*NL*
now
,
they
say
nothing
;
but
I
know
their
secret
.
His
house
is
gloomy
,
and
*NL*
there
is
a
secret
in
it
.
I
am
convinced
that
in
some
box
he
has
a
razor
*NL*
hidden
,
tied
round
with
silk
,
just
like
the
one
that
Moscow
murderer
*NL*
had
.
This
man
also
lived
with
his
mother
,
and
had
a
razor
hidden
away
,
*NL*
tied
round
with
white
silk
,
and
with
this
razor
he
intended
to
cut
a
*NL*
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
the
while
I
was
in
their
house
I
felt
sure
that
somewhere
beneath
*NL*
the
floor
there
was
hidden
away
some
dreadful
corpse
,
wrapped
in
*NL*
oil-cloth
,
perhaps
buried
there
by
his
father
,
who
knows
?
Just
as
in
the
*NL*
Moscow
case
.
I
could
have
shown
you
the
very
spot
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
always
silent
,
but
I
know
well
that
he
loves
me
so
much
that
he
*NL*
must
hate
me
.
My
wedding
and
yours
are
to
be
on
the
same
day
;
so
I
have
*NL*
arranged
with
him
.
I
have
no
secrets
from
him
.
I
would
kill
him
from
*NL*
very
fright
,
but
he
will
kill
me
first
.
He
has
just
burst
out
laughing
,
*NL*
and
says
that
I
am
raving
.
He
knows
I
am
writing
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
much
more
of
this
delirious
wandering
in
the
letters
--
one
of
*NL*
them
was
very
long
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
the
prince
came
out
of
the
dark
,
gloomy
park
,
in
which
he
had
*NL*
wandered
about
for
hours
just
as
yesterday
.
The
bright
night
seemed
to
*NL*
him
to
be
lighter
than
ever
.
``
It
must
be
quite
early
,
''
he
thought
.
-LRB-
He
*NL*
had
forgotten
his
watch
.
-RRB-
There
was
a
sound
of
distant
music
somewhere
.
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
he
thought
,
``
the
Vauxhall
!
They
wo
n't
be
there
today
,
of
course
!
''
*NL*
At
this
moment
he
noticed
that
he
was
close
to
their
house
;
he
had
felt
*NL*
that
he
must
gravitate
to
this
spot
eventually
,
and
,
with
a
beating
*NL*
heart
,
he
mounted
the
verandah
steps
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
met
him
;
the
verandah
was
empty
,
and
nearly
pitch
dark
.
He
opened
*NL*
the
door
into
the
room
,
but
it
,
too
,
was
dark
and
empty
.
He
stood
in
the
*NL*
middle
of
the
room
in
perplexity
.
Suddenly
the
door
opened
,
and
in
came
*NL*
Alexandra
,
candle
in
hand
.
Seeing
the
prince
she
stopped
before
him
in
*NL*
surprise
,
looking
at
him
questioningly
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
clear
that
she
had
been
merely
passing
through
the
room
from
door
*NL*
to
door
,
and
had
not
had
the
remotest
notion
that
she
would
meet
anyone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
did
you
come
here
?
''
she
asked
,
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
--
I
--
came
in
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma
is
not
very
well
,
nor
is
Aglaya

Adelaida
has
gone
to
bed
,
and
*NL*
I
am
just
going
.
We
were
alone
the
whole
evening
.
Father
and
Prince
S.
*NL*
have
gone
to
town
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
come
to
you

now

to

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know

it
is

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Half-past

are
always
in

by
one

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

I
thought
it
was
half-past
nine

*NL*
*NL*
``
Never

''
she
laughed
,
``
but
why
did
n't
you
come
earlier
?
Perhaps
you
*NL*
were
expected
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought

he
stammered
,
making
for
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Au
revoir
!

I
shall
amuse
them
all
with
this
story
tomorrow
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
along
the
road
towards
his
own
house
.
His
heart
was
beating
,
*NL*
his
thoughts
were
confused
,
everything
around
seemed
to
be
part
of
a
*NL*
dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
suddenly
,
just
as
twice
already
he
had
awaked
from
sleep
with
the
*NL*
same
vision
,
that
very
apparition
now
seemed
to
rise
up
before
him
.
The
*NL*
woman
appeared
to
step
out
from
the
park
,
and
stand
in
the
path
in
front
*NL*
of
him
,
as
though
she
had
been
waiting
for
him
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
shuddered
and
stopped
;
she
seized
his
hand
and
pressed
it
frenziedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
,
this
was
no
apparition
!
*NL*
*NL*
There
she
stood
at
last
,
face
to
face
with
him
,
for
the
first
time
since
*NL*
their
parting
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
said
something
,
but
he
looked
silently
back
at
her
.
His
heart
ached
*NL*
with
anguish
.
Oh
!
never
would
he
banish
the
recollection
of
this
meeting
*NL*
with
her
,
and
he
never
remembered
it
but
with
the
same
pain
and
agony
of
*NL*
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
on
her
knees
before
him
--
there
in
the
open
road
--
like
a
*NL*
madwoman
.
He
retreated
a
step
,
but
she
caught
his
hand
and
kissed
*NL*
it
,
and
,
just
as
in
his
dream
,
the
tears
were
sparkling
on
her
long
,
*NL*
beautiful
lashes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
up
!
''
he
said
,
in
a
frightened
whisper
,
raising
her
.
``
Get
up
at
*NL*
once
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
happy
--
are
you
happy
?
''
she
asked
.
``
Say
this
one
word

Are
you
*NL*
happy
now
?
Today
,
this
moment
?
Have
you
just
been
with
her
?
What
did
she
*NL*
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
rise
from
her
knees
;
she
would
not
listen
to
him
;
she
put
*NL*
her
questions
hurriedly
,
as
though
she
were
pursued
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
away
tomorrow
,
as
you
bade
me
--
I
wo
n't
write

so
that
this
*NL*
is
the
last
time
I
shall
see
you
,
the
last
time

This
is
really
the

time

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
be
calm
--
be
calm
!
Get
up
!
''
he
entreated
,
in
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
gazed
thirstily
at
him
and
clutched
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
!
''
she
said
at
last
,
and
rose
and
left
him
,
very
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
noticed
that
Rogojin
had
suddenly
appeared
at
her
side
,
and
*NL*
had
taken
her
arm
and
was
leading
her
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
a
minute
,
prince
,
''
shouted
the
latter
,
as
he
went
.
``
I
shall
be
*NL*
back
in
five
minutes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
reappeared
in
five
minutes
as
he
had
said
.
The
prince
was
waiting
for
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
put
her
in
the
carriage
,
''
he
said
;
``
it
has
been
waiting
round
the
*NL*
corner
there
since
ten
o'clock
.
She
expected
that
you
would
be
with
_
them
_
*NL*
all
the
evening
.
I
told
her
exactly
what
you
wrote
me
.
She
wo
n't
write
*NL*
to
the
girl
any
more
,
she
promises
;
and
tomorrow
she
will
be
off
,
as
you
*NL*
wish
.
She
desired
to
see
you
for
the
last
time
,
although
you
refused
,
*NL*
so
we
've
been
sitting
and
waiting
on
that
bench
till
you
should
pass
on
*NL*
your
way
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
she
bring
you
with
her
of
her
own
accord
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
she
did
!
''
said
Rogojin
,
showing
his
teeth
;
``
and
I
saw
for
*NL*
myself
what
I
knew
before

You
've
read
her
letters
,
I
suppose

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
read
them
?

asked
the
prince
,
struck
by
the
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course

she
showed
them
to
me
herself

You
are
thinking
of

*NL*
razor

eh

Ha

ha

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

she
is
mad

cried
the
prince
,
wringing
his
hands
.
``
Who
knows
?
*NL*
Perhaps
she
is
not
so
mad
after
all
,

said
Rogojin
,
softly
,
as
though
*NL*
thinking
aloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
made
no
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
good-bye

said
Rogojin
.
``
I
'm
off
tomorrow
too

you
know

*NL*
Remember
me
kindly
!
By-the-by

he
added
,
turning
round
sharply
again
,
*NL*
``
did
you
answer
her
question
just
now
?
Are
you
happy
,
or
not

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

no

no

cried
the
prince
,
with
unspeakable
sadness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha

ha
!
I
never
supposed
you
would
say
`
yes

''
cried
Rogojin
,
laughing
*NL*
sardonically
.

And
he
disappeared

without
looking
round
again

PART
IV
*NL*
*NL*
I
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
week
had
elapsed
since
the
rendezvous
of
our
two
friends
on
the
*NL*
green
bench
in
the
park
,
when
,
one
fine
morning
at
about
half-past
ten
*NL*
o'clock
,
Varvara
Ardalionovna
,
otherwise
Mrs.
Ptitsin
,
who
had
been
*NL*
out
to
visit
a
friend
,
returned
home
in
a
state
of
considerable
mental
*NL*
depression
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
certain
people
of
whom
it
is
difficult
to
say
anything
which
*NL*
will
at
once
throw
them
into
relief
--
in
other
words
,
describe
them
*NL*
graphically
in
their
typical
characteristics
.
These
are
they
who
are
*NL*
generally
known
as
``
commonplace
people
,
''
and
this
class
comprises
,
of
*NL*
course
,
the
immense
majority
of
mankind
.
Authors
,
as
a
rule
,
attempt
to
*NL*
select
and
portray
types
rarely
met
with
in
their
entirety
,
but
these
*NL*
types
are
nevertheless
more
real
than
real
life
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Podkoleosin
''
-LSB-
A
character
in
Gogol
's
comedy
,
The
Wedding
.
-RSB-
was
perhaps
*NL*
an
exaggeration
,
but
he
was
by
no
means
a
non-existent
character
;
on
the
*NL*
contrary
,
how
many
intelligent
people
,
after
hearing
of
this
Podkoleosin
*NL*
from
Gogol
,
immediately
began
to
find
that
scores
of
their
friends
were
*NL*
exactly
like
him
!
They
knew
,
perhaps
,
before
Gogol
told
them
,
that
their
*NL*
friends
were
like
Podkoleosin
,
but
they
did
not
know
what
name
to
give
*NL*
them
.
In
real
life
,
young
fellows
seldom
jump
out
of
the
window
just
*NL*
before
their
weddings
,
because
such
a
feat
,
not
to
speak
of
its
other
*NL*
aspects
,
must
be
a
decidedly
unpleasant
mode
of
escape
;
and
yet
there
*NL*
are
plenty
of
bridegrooms
,
intelligent
fellows
too
,
who
would
be
ready
*NL*
to
confess
themselves
Podkoleosins
in
the
depths
of
their
consciousness
,
*NL*
just
before
marriage
.
Nor
does
every
husband
feel
bound
to
repeat
*NL*
at
every
step
,
''
_
Tu
l'as
voulu
,
Georges
Dandin
!
_
''
like
another
typical
*NL*
personage
;
and
yet
how
many
millions
and
billions
of
Georges
Dandins
*NL*
there
are
in
real
life
who
feel
inclined
to
utter
this
soul-drawn
cry
*NL*
after
their
honeymoon
,
if
not
the
day
after
the
wedding
!
Therefore
,
*NL*
without
entering
into
any
more
serious
examination
of
the
question
,
I
*NL*
will
content
myself
with
remarking
that
in
real
life
typical
characters
*NL*
are
``
watered
down
,
''
so
to
speak
;
and
all
these
Dandins
and
Podkoleosins
*NL*
actually
exist
among
us
every
day
,
but
in
a
diluted
form
.
I
will
just
*NL*
add
,
however
,
that
Georges
Dandin
might
have
existed
exactly
as
Moliere
*NL*
presented
him
,
and
probably
does
exist
now
and
then
,
though
rarely
;
and
*NL*
so
I
will
end
this
scientific
examination
,
which
is
beginning
to
*NL*
look
like
a
newspaper
criticism
.
But
for
all
this
,
the
question
*NL*
remains
,
--
what
are
the
novelists
to
do
with
commonplace
people
,
and
how
*NL*
are
they
to
be
presented
to
the
reader
in
such
a
form
as
to
be
in
*NL*
the
least
degree
interesting
?
They
can
not
be
left
out
altogether
,
for
*NL*
commonplace
people
meet
one
at
every
turn
of
life
,
and
to
leave
them
out
*NL*
would
be
to
destroy
the
whole
reality
and
probability
of
the
story
.
To
*NL*
fill
a
novel
with
typical
characters
only
,
or
with
merely
strange
and
*NL*
uncommon
people
,
would
render
the
book
unreal
and
improbable
,
and
*NL*
would
very
likely
destroy
the
interest
.
In
my
opinion
,
the
duty
of
the
*NL*
novelist
is
to
seek
out
points
of
interest
and
instruction
even
in
the
*NL*
characters
of
commonplace
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
instance
,
when
the
whole
essence
of
an
ordinary
person
's
nature
lies
*NL*
in
his
perpetual
and
unchangeable
commonplaceness
;
and
when
in
spite
of
*NL*
all
his
endeavours
to
do
something
out
of
the
common
,
this
person
ends
,
*NL*
eventually
,
by
remaining
in
his
unbroken
line
of
routine
--
.
I
think
*NL*
such
an
individual
really
does
become
a
type
of
his
own
--
a
type
of
*NL*
commonplaceness
which
will
not
for
the
world
,
if
it
can
help
it
,
*NL*
be
contented
,
but
strains
and
yearns
to
be
something
original
and
*NL*
independent
,
without
the
slightest
possibility
of
being
so
.
To
*NL*
this
class
of
commonplace
people
belong
several
characters
in
this
*NL*
novel
;
--
characters
which
--
I
admit
--
I
have
not
drawn
very
vividly
up
to
*NL*
now
for
my
reader
's
benefit
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
were
,
for
instance
,
Varvara
Ardalionovna
Ptitsin
,
her
husband
,
and
*NL*
her
brother
,
Gania
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
nothing
so
annoying
as
to
be
fairly
rich
,
of
a
fairly
good
*NL*
family
,
pleasing
presence
,
average
education
,
to
be
``
not
stupid
,
''
*NL*
kind-hearted
,
and
yet
to
have
no
talent
at
all
,
no
originality
,
not
a
*NL*
single
idea
of
one
's
own
--
to
be
,
in
fact
,
``
just
like
everyone
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Of
such
people
there
are
countless
numbers
in
this
world
--
far
more
even
*NL*
than
appear
.
They
can
be
divided
into
two
classes
as
all
men
can
--
that
*NL*
is
,
those
of
limited
intellect
,
and
those
who
are
much
cleverer
.
The
*NL*
former
of
these
classes
is
the
happier
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
a
commonplace
man
of
limited
intellect
,
for
instance
,
nothing
is
*NL*
simpler
than
to
imagine
himself
an
original
character
,
and
to
revel
in
*NL*
that
belief
without
the
slightest
misgiving
.
*NL*
*NL*
Many
of
our
young
women
have
thought
fit
to
cut
their
hair
short
,
put
on
*NL*
blue
spectacles
,
and
call
themselves
Nihilists
.
By
doing
this
they
have
*NL*
been
able
to
persuade
themselves
,
without
further
trouble
,
that
they
*NL*
have
acquired
new
convictions
of
their
own
.
Some
men
have
but
felt
some
*NL*
little
qualm
of
kindness
towards
their
fellow-men
,
and
the
fact
has
*NL*
been
quite
enough
to
persuade
them
that
they
stand
alone
in
the
van
of
*NL*
enlightenment
and
that
no
one
has
such
humanitarian
feelings
as
they
.
*NL*
Others
have
but
to
read
an
idea
of
somebody
else
's
,
and
they
can
*NL*
immediately
assimilate
it
and
believe
that
it
was
a
child
of
their
own
*NL*
brain
.
The
``
impudence
of
ignorance
,
''
if
I
may
use
the
expression
,
is
*NL*
developed
to
a
wonderful
extent
in
such
cases
;
--
unlikely
as
it
appears
,
*NL*
it
is
met
with
at
every
turn
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
confidence
of
a
stupid
man
in
his
own
talents
has
been
wonderfully
*NL*
depicted
by
Gogol
in
the
amazing
character
of
Pirogoff
.
Pirogoff
has
*NL*
not
the
slightest
doubt
of
his
own
genius
,
--
nay
,
of
his
_
superiority
_
of
*NL*
genius
,
--
so
certain
is
he
of
it
that
he
never
questions
it
.
How
*NL*
many
Pirogoffs
have
there
not
been
among
our
writers
--
scholars
,
*NL*
propagandists
?
I
say
``
have
been
,
''
but
indeed
there
are
plenty
of
them
at
*NL*
this
very
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
friend
,
Gania
,
belonged
to
the
other
class
--
to
the
``
much
cleverer
''
*NL*
persons
,
though
he
was
from
head
to
foot
permeated
and
saturated
with
*NL*
the
longing
to
be
original
.
This
class
,
as
I
have
said
above
,
is
far
*NL*
less
happy
.
For
the
``
clever
commonplace
''
person
,
though
he
may
possibly
*NL*
imagine
himself
a
man
of
genius
and
originality
,
none
the
less
has
*NL*
within
his
heart
the
deathless
worm
of
suspicion
and
doubt
;
and
this
*NL*
doubt
sometimes
brings
a
clever
man
to
despair
.
-LRB-
As
a
rule
,
however
,
*NL*
nothing
tragic
happens
;
--
his
liver
becomes
a
little
damaged
in
the
*NL*
course
of
time
,
nothing
more
serious
.
Such
men
do
not
give
up
their
*NL*
aspirations
after
originality
without
a
severe
struggle
,
--
and
there
have
*NL*
been
men
who
,
though
good
fellows
in
themselves
,
and
even
benefactors
*NL*
to
humanity
,
have
sunk
to
the
level
of
base
criminals
for
the
sake
of
*NL*
originality
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gania
was
a
beginner
,
as
it
were
,
upon
this
road
.
A
deep
and
*NL*
unchangeable
consciousness
of
his
own
lack
of
talent
,
combined
with
a
*NL*
vast
longing
to
be
able
to
persuade
himself
that
he
was
original
,
had
*NL*
rankled
in
his
heart
,
even
from
childhood
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
seemed
to
have
been
born
with
overwrought
nerves
,
and
in
his
*NL*
passionate
desire
to
excel
,
he
was
often
led
to
the
brink
of
some
*NL*
rash
step
;
and
yet
,
having
resolved
upon
such
a
step
,
when
the
moment
*NL*
arrived
,
he
invariably
proved
too
sensible
to
take
it
.
He
was
ready
,
*NL*
in
the
same
way
,
to
do
a
base
action
in
order
to
obtain
his
wished-for
*NL*
object
;
and
yet
,
when
the
moment
came
to
do
it
,
he
found
that
he
was
too
*NL*
honest
for
any
great
baseness
.
-LRB-
Not
that
he
objected
to
acts
of
petty
*NL*
meanness
--
he
was
always
ready
for
_
them
_
.
-RRB-
He
looked
with
hate
and
*NL*
loathing
on
the
poverty
and
downfall
of
his
family
,
and
treated
his
*NL*
mother
with
haughty
contempt
,
although
he
knew
that
his
whole
future
*NL*
depended
on
her
character
and
reputation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aglaya
had
simply
frightened
him
;
yet
he
did
not
give
up
all
thoughts
of
*NL*
her
--
though
he
never
seriously
hoped
that
she
would
condescend
to
him
.
*NL*
At
the
time
of
his
``
adventure
''
with
Nastasia
Philipovna
he
had
come
to
*NL*
the
conclusion
that
money
was
his
only
hope
--
money
should
do
all
for
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
moment
when
he
lost
Aglaya
,
and
after
the
scene
with
Nastasia
,
he
*NL*
had
felt
so
low
in
his
own
eyes
that
he
actually
brought
the
money
back
*NL*
to
the
prince
.
Of
this
returning
of
the
money
given
to
him
by
a
madwoman
*NL*
who
had
received
it
from
a
madman
,
he
had
often
repented
since
--
though
*NL*
he
never
ceased
to
be
proud
of
his
action
.
During
the
short
time
that
*NL*
Muishkin
remained
in
Petersburg
Gania
had
had
time
to
come
to
hate
him
*NL*
for
his
sympathy
,
though
the
prince
told
him
that
it
was
``
not
everyone
*NL*
who
would
have
acted
so
nobly
''
as
to
return
the
money
.
He
had
long
*NL*
pondered
,
too
,
over
his
relations
with
Aglaya
,
and
had
persuaded
himself
*NL*
that
with
such
a
strange
,
childish
,
innocent
character
as
hers
,
things
*NL*
might
have
ended
very
differently
.
Remorse
then
seized
him
;
he
threw
up
*NL*
his
post
,
and
buried
himself
in
self-torment
and
reproach
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
lived
at
Ptitsin
's
,
and
openly
showed
contempt
for
the
latter
,
though
*NL*
he
always
listened
to
his
advice
,
and
was
sensible
enough
to
ask
for
it
*NL*
when
he
wanted
it
.
Gavrila
Ardalionovitch
was
angry
with
Ptitsin
because
*NL*
the
latter
did
not
care
to
become
a
Rothschild
.
``
If
you
are
to
be
a
*NL*
Jew
,
''
he
said
,
``
do
it
properly
--
squeeze
people
right
and
left
,
show
some
*NL*
character
;
be
the
King
of
the
Jews
while
you
are
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ptitsin
was
quiet
and
not
easily
offended
--
he
only
laughed
.
But
on
one
*NL*
occasion
he
explained
seriously
to
Gania
that
he
was
no
Jew
,
that
he
*NL*
did
nothing
dishonest
,
that
he
could
not
help
the
market
price
of
money
,
*NL*
that
,
thanks
to
his
accurate
habits
,
he
had
already
a
good
footing
and
*NL*
was
respected
,
and
that
his
business
was
flourishing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
sha
n't
ever
be
a
Rothschild
,
and
there
is
no
reason
why
I
should
,
''
he
*NL*
added
,
smiling
;
``
but
I
shall
have
a
house
in
the
Liteynaya
,
perhaps
two
,
*NL*
and
that
will
be
enough
for
me
.
''
``
Who
knows
but
what
I
may
have
three
!
''
*NL*
he
concluded
to
himself
;
but
this
dream
,
cherished
inwardly
,
he
never
*NL*
confided
to
a
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nature
loves
and
favours
such
people
.
Ptitsin
will
certainly
have
his
*NL*
reward
,
not
three
houses
,
but
four
,
precisely
because
from
childhood
up
*NL*
he
had
realized
that
he
would
never
be
a
Rothschild
.
That
will
be
the
*NL*
limit
of
Ptitsin
's
fortune
,
and
,
come
what
may
,
he
will
never
have
more
*NL*
than
four
houses
.
*NL*
*NL*
Varvara
Ardalionovna
was
not
like
her
brother
.
She
too
,
had
passionate
*NL*
desires
,
but
they
were
persistent
rather
than
impetuous
.
Her
plans
were
*NL*
as
wise
as
her
methods
of
carrying
them
out
.
No
doubt
she
also
belonged
*NL*
to
the
category
of
ordinary
people
who
dream
of
being
original
,
but
she
*NL*
soon
discovered
that
she
had
not
a
grain
of
true
originality
,
and
she
*NL*
did
not
let
it
trouble
her
too
much
.
Perhaps
a
certain
kind
of
pride
*NL*
came
to
her
help
.
She
made
her
first
concession
to
the
demands
of
*NL*
practical
life
with
great
resolution
when
she
consented
to
marry
*NL*
Ptitsin
.
However
,
when
she
married
she
did
not
say
to
herself
,
``
Never
*NL*
mind
a
mean
action
if
it
leads
to
the
end
in
view
,
''
as
her
brother
would
*NL*
certainly
have
said
in
such
a
case
;
it
is
quite
probable
that
he
may
*NL*
have
said
it
when
he
expressed
his
elder-brotherly
satisfaction
at
her
*NL*
decision
.
Far
from
this
;
Varvara
Ardalionovna
did
not
marry
until
she
*NL*
felt
convinced
that
her
future
husband
was
unassuming
,
agreeable
,
*NL*
almost
cultured
,
and
that
nothing
on
earth
would
tempt
him
to
a
really
*NL*
dishonourable
deed
.
As
to
small
meannesses
,
such
trifles
did
not
trouble
*NL*
her
.
Indeed
,
who
is
free
from
them
?
It
is
absurd
to
expect
the
ideal
!
*NL*
Besides
,
she
knew
that
her
marriage
would
provide
a
refuge
for
all
her
*NL*
family
.
Seeing
Gania
unhappy
,
she
was
anxious
to
help
him
,
in
spite
of
*NL*
their
former
disputes
and
misunderstandings
.
Ptitsin
,
in
a
friendly
way
,
*NL*
would
press
his
brother-in-law
to
enter
the
army
.
``
You
know
,
''
he
said
*NL*
sometimes
,
jokingly
,
``
you
despise
generals
and
generaldom
,
but
you
will
*NL*
see
that
`
they
'
will
all
end
by
being
generals
in
their
turn
.
You
will
*NL*
see
it
if
you
live
long
enough
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
should
they
suppose
that
I
despise
generals
?
''
Gania
thought
*NL*
sarcastically
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
serve
her
brother
's
interests
,
Varvara
Ardalionovna
was
constantly
at
*NL*
the
Epanchins
'
house
,
helped
by
the
fact
that
in
childhood
she
and
Gania
*NL*
had
played
with
General
Ivan
Fedorovitch
's
daughters
.
It
would
have
been
*NL*
inconsistent
with
her
character
if
in
these
visits
she
had
been
pursuing
*NL*
a
chimera
;
her
project
was
not
chimerical
at
all
;
she
was
building
on
*NL*
a
firm
basis
--
on
her
knowledge
of
the
character
of
the
Epanchin
family
,
*NL*
especially
Aglaya
,
whom
she
studied
closely
.
All
Varvara
's
efforts
*NL*
were
directed
towards
bringing
Aglaya
and
Gania
together
.
Perhaps
she
*NL*
achieved
some
result
;
perhaps
,
also
,
she
made
the
mistake
of
depending
*NL*
too
much
upon
her
brother
,
and
expecting
more
from
him
than
he
would
*NL*
ever
be
capable
of
giving
.
However
this
may
be
,
her
manoeuvres
were
*NL*
skilful
enough
.
For
weeks
at
a
time
she
would
never
mention
Gania
.
Her
*NL*
attitude
was
modest
but
dignified
,
and
she
was
always
extremely
truthful
*NL*
and
sincere
.
Examining
the
depths
of
her
conscience
,
she
found
nothing
*NL*
to
reproach
herself
with
,
and
this
still
further
strengthened
her
in
*NL*
her
designs
.
But
Varvara
Ardalionovna
sometimes
remarked
that
she
felt
*NL*
spiteful
;
that
there
was
a
good
deal
of
vanity
in
her
,
perhaps
even
of
*NL*
wounded
vanity
.
She
noticed
this
at
certain
times
more
than
at
others
,
*NL*
and
especially
after
her
visits
to
the
Epanchins
.
*NL*
*NL*
Today
,
as
I
have
said
,
she
returned
from
their
house
with
a
heavy
*NL*
feeling
of
dejection
.
There
was
a
sensation
of
bitterness
,
a
sort
of
*NL*
mocking
contempt
,
mingled
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arrived
at
her
own
house
,
Varia
heard
a
considerable
commotion
going
*NL*
on
in
the
upper
storey
,
and
distinguished
the
voices
of
her
father
and
*NL*
brother
.
On
entering
the
salon
she
found
Gania
pacing
up
and
down
at
*NL*
frantic
speed
,
pale
with
rage
and
almost
tearing
his
hair
.
She
frowned
,
*NL*
and
subsided
on
to
the
sofa
with
a
tired
air
,
and
without
taking
the
*NL*
trouble
to
remove
her
hat
.
She
very
well
knew
that
if
she
kept
quiet
and
*NL*
asked
her
brother
nothing
about
his
reason
for
tearing
up
and
down
the
*NL*
room
,
his
wrath
would
fall
upon
her
head
.
So
she
hastened
to
put
the
*NL*
question
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
old
story
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Old
story
?
No
!
Heaven
knows
what
's
up
now
--
I
do
n't
!
Father
has
simply
*NL*
gone
mad
;
mother
's
in
floods
of
tears
.
Upon
my
word
,
Varia
,
I
must
kick
*NL*
him
out
of
the
house
;
or
else
go
myself
,
''
he
added
,
probably
remembering
*NL*
that
he
could
not
well
turn
people
out
of
a
house
which
was
not
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
make
allowances
,
''
murmured
Varia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Make
allowances
?
For
whom
?
Him
--
the
old
blackguard
?
No
,
no
,
Varia
--
that
*NL*
wo
n't
do
!
It
wo
n't
do
,
I
tell
you
!
And
look
at
the
swagger
of
the
man
!
*NL*
He
's
all
to
blame
himself
,
and
yet
he
puts
on
so
much
`
side
'
that
you
'd
*NL*
think
--
my
word
!
--
`
It
's
too
much
trouble
to
go
through
the
gate
,
you
must
*NL*
break
the
fence
for
me
!
'
That
's
the
sort
of
air
he
puts
on
;
but
what
's
*NL*
the
matter
with
you
,
Varia
?
What
a
curious
expression
you
have
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
all
right
,
''
said
Varia
,
in
a
tone
that
sounded
as
though
she
were
*NL*
all
wrong
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gania
looked
more
intently
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
been
_
there
?
_
''
he
asked
,
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
find
out
anything
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
unexpected
.
I
discovered
that
it
's
all
true
.
My
husband
was
*NL*
wiser
than
either
of
us
.
Just
as
he
suspected
from
the
beginning
,
so
it
*NL*
has
fallen
out
.
Where
is
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Out
.
Well
--
what
has
happened
?
--
go
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
prince
is
formally
engaged
to
her
--
that
's
settled
.
The
elder
*NL*
sisters
told
me
about
it
.
Aglaya
has
agreed
.
They
do
n't
attempt
to
*NL*
conceal
it
any
longer
;
you
know
how
mysterious
and
secret
they
have
all
*NL*
been
up
to
now
.
Adelaida
's
wedding
is
put
off
again
,
so
that
both
can
be
*NL*
married
on
one
day
.
Is
n't
that
delightfully
romantic
?
Somebody
ought
to
*NL*
write
a
poem
on
it
.
Sit
down
and
write
an
ode
instead
of
tearing
up
*NL*
and
down
like
that
.
This
evening
Princess
Bielokonski
is
to
arrive
;
she
*NL*
comes
just
in
time
--
they
have
a
party
tonight
.
He
is
to
be
presented
*NL*
to
old
Bielokonski
,
though
I
believe
he
knows
her
already
;
probably
the
*NL*
engagement
will
be
openly
announced
.
They
are
only
afraid
that
he
may
*NL*
knock
something
down
,
or
trip
over
something
when
he
comes
into
the
*NL*
room
.
It
would
be
just
like
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gania
listened
attentively
,
but
to
his
sister
's
astonishment
he
was
by
*NL*
no
means
so
impressed
by
this
news
-LRB-
which
should
,
she
thought
,
have
been
*NL*
so
important
to
him
-RRB-
as
she
had
expected
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
was
clear
enough
all
along
,
''
he
said
,
after
a
moment
's
*NL*
reflection
.
``
So
that
's
the
end
,
''
he
added
,
with
a
disagreeable
smile
,
*NL*
continuing
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
,
but
much
slower
than
before
,
*NL*
and
glancing
slyly
into
his
sister
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
good
thing
that
you
take
it
philosophically
,
at
all
events

*NL*
said
Varia
.
``
I
'm
really
very
glad
of
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
's
off

off

yours

I
should
say

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
have
served
you
faithfully

I
never

asked
you

Aglaya

*NL*
*NL*
``
Did

all
over

a
good

too

pair
of
fools
that
we
have
been

I
*NL*
confess
I
have
never
been
able
to
look
at

seriously

I
busied
myself

in

thinking
that
there
was
no

happen
with
a
funny

with

There
were
ninety

out

I
suppose

you

will
never
weary
of
egging
*NL*
me
on
to
work
again

You
'll
begin
your
lectures
about
perseverance
and
*NL*
strength
of
will
,
and
all
that

I
know
it
all
by
heart

said
Gania
,
*NL*
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
got
some
new
idea
in
his
head

thought
Varia
.
``
Are
they
pleased
*NL*
over
there

the

asked
Gania

suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
N
--
no
,
I
do
n't
think
they
are
.
You
can
judge
for
yourself
.
I
think
the
*NL*
general
is
pleased
enough
;
her
mother
is
a
little
uneasy
.
She
always
*NL*
loathed
the
idea
of
the
prince
as
a
_
husband
_
;
everybody
knows
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
naturally
.
The
bridegroom
is
an
impossible
and
ridiculous
*NL*
one
.
I
mean
,
has
_
she
_
given
her
formal
consent
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
not
said
`
no
,
'
up
to
now
,
and
that
's
all
.
It
was
sure
to
be
so
*NL*
with
her
.
You
know
what
she
is
like
.
You
know
how
absurdly
shy
she
is
.
*NL*
You
remember
how
she
used
to
hide
in
a
cupboard
as
a
child
,
so
as
to
*NL*
avoid
seeing
visitors
,
for
hours
at
a
time

She
is
just
the
same
now
;
*NL*
but
,
do
you
know
,
I
think
there
is
something
serious
in
the
matter
,
even
*NL*
from
her
side
;
I
feel
it
,
somehow
.
She
laughs
at
the
prince
,
they
say
,
*NL*
from
morn
to
night
in
order
to
hide
her
real
feelings
;
but
you
may
be
*NL*
sure
she
finds
occasion
to
say
something
or
other
to
him
on
the
sly
,
for
*NL*
he
himself
is
in
a
state
of
radiant
happiness
.
He
walks
in
the
clouds
;
*NL*
they
say
he
is
extremely
funny
just
now
;
I
heard
it
from
themselves
.
*NL*
They
seemed
to
be
laughing
at
me
in
their
sleeves

those
elder
girls

I
*NL*
do
n't
know
why
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gania
had
begun
to
frown
,
and
probably
Varia
added
this
last
sentence
*NL*
in
order
to
probe
his
thought
.
However
,
at
this
moment
,
the
noise
began
*NL*
again
upstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
turn
him
out
!

shouted
Gania
,
glad
of
the
opportunity
of
venting
*NL*
his
vexation
.
``
I
shall
just
turn
him
out

have
this

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

then
he
'll
go
about

disgrace

yesterday

*NL*
*NL*
``
How

What

*NL*
asked
Gania
,
in
alarm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
goodness
me
,
do
n't
you
know

Varia
stopped
short
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
You
do
n't
mean
to
say
that
he
went
there
yesterday

cried
Gania
,
*NL*
flushing
red
with
shame
and
anger
.
``
Good

Varia
!
Speak
!
You
have
*NL*
just
been
there

Was

he
there

not

And
Gania
rushed
for
the
*NL*
door
.
Varia
followed
and
caught
him
by
both
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What

Where

They

themselves

make
head

he
frightened
*NL*
them
all
.
He
came
to
see
the
general
,
who
was
not
at
home
;
so
he
asked
*NL*
for
Lizabetha
Prokofievna

First
of
all
,
he
begged
her
for
some
place
,
*NL*
or
situation
,
for
work
of
some
kind
,
and
then
he
began
to
complain
about
*NL*
_
us
_
,
about
me
and
my
husband
,
and
you
,
especially
_
you

he
said

things

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

you
find
out
?

muttered
Gania
,
trembling
hysterically

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

nothing
more
than
that

understand
him

themselves

very
likely
did
n't
tell
me
all

*NL*
*NL*
Gania
seized
his
head
with
both
hands
and
tottered
to
the
window
;
Varia
*NL*
sat
down
at
the
other
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Funny
girl

Aglaya

she
observed
,
after
a
pause
.
``
When
she
left
me
she

said

personal
respects

*NL*
certainly
find
an
opportunity
to
see
your
father
one
day

so
*NL*
serious
over
it
.
She
's
a
strange
creature

*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
n't
she
joking

She
was
speaking
sarcastically

bitterly

would
harm
you
in
Aglaya

You
*NL*
little
know

character

She
is
capable

refusing
the
most
brilliant

party

running
away

starving
in
a
garret
with
some
wretched

simply

caught

firstly

never

quite
enough
for

by
accepting

she
puts

out

annoys

all
round

what
she
likes

people
's
secrets
,
or
*NL*
anything
approaching
to
scandal
.
Believe
it
or
not
,
but
I
'm
pretty
sure
*NL*
he
has
got
round
Aglaya
.
If
he
has
n't
,
he
soon
will
.
Rogojin
is
intimate
*NL*
with
him
,
too
.
How
the
prince
does
n't
notice
it
,
I
ca
n't
understand
.
The
*NL*
little
wretch
considers
me
his
enemy
now
and
does
his
best
to
catch
me
*NL*
tripping
.
What
on
earth
does
it
matter
to
him
,
when
he
's
dying
?
However
,
*NL*
you
'll
see
;
I
shall
catch
_
him
_
tripping
yet
,
and
not
he
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
you
get
him
over
here
,
if
you
hate
him
so
?
And
is
it
really
*NL*
worth
your
while
to
try
to
score
off
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
it
was
yourself
who
advised
me
to
bring
him
over
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
he
might
be
useful
.
You
know
he
is
in
love
with
Aglaya
*NL*
himself
,
now
,
and
has
written
to
her
;
he
has
even
written
to
Lizabetha
*NL*
Prokofievna
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
he
's
not
dangerous
there
!
''
cried
Gania
,
laughing
angrily
.
``
However
,
*NL*
I
believe
there
is
something
of
that
sort
in
the
air
;
he
is
very
likely
*NL*
to
be
in
love
,
for
he
is
a
mere
boy
.
But
he
wo
n't
write
anonymous
*NL*
letters
to
the
old
lady
;
that
would
be
too
audacious
a
thing
for
him
to
*NL*
attempt
;
but
I
dare
swear
the
very
first
thing
he
did
was
to
show
me
up
*NL*
to
Aglaya
as
a
base
deceiver
and
intriguer
.
I
confess
I
was
fool
enough
*NL*
to
attempt
something
through
him
at
first
.
I
thought
he
would
throw
*NL*
himself
into
my
service
out
of
revengeful
feelings
towards
the
prince
,
*NL*
the
sly
little
beast
!
But
I
know
him
better
now
.
As
for
the
theft
,
he
*NL*
may
have
heard
of
it
from
the
widow
in
Petersburg
,
for
if
the
old
man
*NL*
committed
himself
to
such
an
act
,
he
can
have
done
it
for
no
other
*NL*
object
but
to
give
the
money
to
her
.
Hippolyte
said
to
me
,
without
any
*NL*
prelude
,
that
the
general
had
promised
the
widow
four
hundred
roubles
.
*NL*
Of
course
I
understood
,
and
the
little
wretch
looked
at
me
with
a
nasty
*NL*
sort
of
satisfaction
.
I
know
him
;
you
may
depend
upon
it
he
went
and
*NL*
told
mother
too
,
for
the
pleasure
of
wounding
her
.
And
why
does
n't
he
*NL*
die
,
I
should
like
to
know
?
He
undertook
to
die
within
three
weeks
,
*NL*
and
here
he
is
getting
fatter
.
His
cough
is
better
,
too
.
It
was
only
*NL*
yesterday
that
he
said
that
was
the
second
day
he
had
n't
coughed
blood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
turn
him
out
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
_
hate
_
,
I
despise
him
,
''
said
Gania
,
grandly
.
``
Well
,
I
do
hate
*NL*
him
,
if
you
like
!
''
he
added
,
with
a
sudden
access
of
rage
,
``
and
I
'll
*NL*
tell
him
so
to
his
face
,
even
when
he
's
dying
!
If
you
had
but
read
his
*NL*
confession
--
good
Lord
!
what
refinement
of
impudence
!
Oh
,
but
I
'd
have
*NL*
liked
to
whip
him
then
and
there
,
like
a
schoolboy
,
just
to
see
how
*NL*
surprised
he
would
have
been
!
Now
he
hates
everybody
because
he
--
Oh
,
I
*NL*
say
,
what
on
earth
are
they
doing
there
!
Listen
to
that
noise
!
I
really
*NL*
ca
n't
stand
this
any
longer
.
Ptitsin
!
''
he
cried
,
as
the
latter
entered
*NL*
the
room
,
``
what
in
the
name
of
goodness
are
we
coming
to
?
Listen
to
*NL*
that
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
noise
came
rapidly
nearer
,
the
door
burst
open
,
and
old
General
*NL*
Ivolgin
,
raging
,
furious
,
purple-faced
,
and
trembling
with
anger
,
rushed
*NL*
in
.
He
was
followed
by
Nina
Alexandrovna
,
Colia
,
and
behind
the
rest
,
*NL*
Hippolyte
.
*NL*
*NL*
II
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hippolyte
had
now
been
five
days
at
the
Ptitsins
'
.
His
flitting
from
the
*NL*
prince
's
to
these
new
quarters
had
been
brought
about
quite
naturally
*NL*
and
without
many
words
.
He
did
not
quarrel
with
the
prince
--
in
fact
,
*NL*
they
seemed
to
part
as
friends
.
Gania
,
who
had
been
hostile
enough
on
*NL*
that
eventful
evening
,
had
himself
come
to
see
him
a
couple
of
days
*NL*
later
,
probably
in
obedience
to
some
sudden
impulse
.
For
some
reason
or
*NL*
other
,
Rogojin
too
had
begun
to
visit
the
sick
boy
.
The
prince
thought
*NL*
it
might
be
better
for
him
to
move
away
from
his
-LRB-
the
prince
's
-RRB-
house
.
*NL*
Hippolyte
informed
him
,
as
he
took
his
leave
,
that
Ptitsin
``
had
been
*NL*
kind
enough
to
offer
him
a
corner
,
''
and
did
not
say
a
word
about
Gania
,
*NL*
though
Gania
had
procured
his
invitation
,
and
himself
came
to
fetch
him
*NL*
away
.
Gania
noticed
this
at
the
time
,
and
put
it
to
Hippolyte
's
debit
on
*NL*
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gania
was
right
when
he
told
his
sister
that
Hippolyte
was
getting
*NL*
better
;
that
he
was
better
was
clear
at
the
first
glance
.
He
entered
the
*NL*
room
now
last
of
all
,
deliberately
,
and
with
a
disagreeable
smile
on
his
*NL*
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nina
Alexandrovna
came
in
,
looking
frightened
.
She
had
changed
much
*NL*
since
we
last
saw
her
,
half
a
year
ago
,
and
had
grown
thin
and
pale
.
*NL*
Colia
looked
worried
and
perplexed
.
He
could
not
understand
the
vagaries
*NL*
of
the
general
,
and
knew
nothing
of
the
last
achievement
of
that
worthy
,
*NL*
which
had
caused
so
much
commotion
in
the
house
.
But
he
could
see
that
*NL*
his
father
had
of
late
changed
very
much
,
and
that
he
had
begun
to
*NL*
behave
in
so
extraordinary
a
fashion
both
at
home
and
abroad
that
he
*NL*
was
not
like
the
same
man
.
What
perplexed
and
disturbed
him
as
much
as
*NL*
anything
was
that
his
father
had
entirely
given
up
drinking
during
the
*NL*
last
few
days
.
Colia
knew
that
he
had
quarrelled
with
both
Lebedeff
and
*NL*
the
prince
,
and
had
just
bought
a
small
bottle
of
vodka
and
brought
it
*NL*
home
for
his
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
,
mother
,
''
he
had
assured
Nina
Alexandrovna
upstairs
,
``
really
you
*NL*
had
better
let
him
drink
.
He
has
not
had
a
drop
for
three
days
;
he
must
*NL*
be
suffering
agonies
--
The
general
now
entered
the
room
,
threw
the
door
*NL*
wide
open
,
and
stood
on
the
threshold
trembling
with
indignation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
,
my
dear
sir
,
''
he
began
,
addressing
Ptitsin
in
a
very
loud
*NL*
tone
of
voice
;
``
if
you
have
really
made
up
your
mind
to
sacrifice
an
old
*NL*
man
--
your
father
too
or
at
all
events
father
of
your
wife
--
an
old
man
*NL*
who
has
served
his
emperor
--
to
a
wretched
little
atheist
like
this
,
all
*NL*
I
can
say
is
,
sir
,
my
foot
shall
cease
to
tread
your
floors
.
Make
your
*NL*
choice
,
sir
;
make
your
choice
quickly
,
if
you
please
!
Me
or
this
--
screw
!
*NL*
Yes
,
screw
,
sir
;
I
said
it
accidentally
,
but
let
the
word
stand
--
this
*NL*
screw
,
for
he
screws
and
drills
himself
into
my
soul
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Had
n't
you
better
say
corkscrew
?
''
said
Hippolyte
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
_
not
_
corkscrew
.
I
am
a
general
,
not
a
bottle
,
sir
.
Make
your
*NL*
choice
,
sir
--
me
or
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Colia
handed
him
a
chair
,
and
he
subsided
into
it
,
breathless
with
*NL*
rage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Had
n't
you
better
--
better
--
take
a
nap
?
''
murmured
the
stupefied
Ptitsin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
nap
?
''
shrieked
the
general
.
``
I
am
not
drunk
,
sir
;
you
insult
me
!
*NL*
I
see
,
''
he
continued
,
rising
,
``
I
see
that
all
are
against
me
here
.
*NL*
Enough
--
I
go
;
but
know
,
sirs
--
know
that
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
not
allowed
to
finish
his
sentence
.
Somebody
pushed
him
back
into
*NL*
his
chair
,
and
begged
him
to
be
calm
.
Nina
Alexandrovna
trembled
,
and
*NL*
cried
quietly
.
Gania
retired
to
the
window
in
disgust
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
have
I
done
?
What
is
his
grievance
?
''
asked
Hippolyte
,
*NL*
grinning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
you
done
,
indeed
?
''
put
in
Nina
Alexandrovna
.
``
You
ought
to
be
*NL*
ashamed
of
yourself
,
teasing
an
old
man
like
that
--
and
in
your
position
,
*NL*
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
pray
what
_
is
_
my
position
,
madame
?
I
have
the
greatest
respect
for
*NL*
you
,
personally
;
but
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
a
little
screw
,
''
cried
the
general
;
``
he
drills
holes
in
my
heart
*NL*
and
soul
.
He
wishes
me
to
be
a
pervert
to
atheism
.
Know
,
you
young
*NL*
greenhorn
,
that
I
was
covered
with
honours
before
ever
you
were
born
;
*NL*
and
you
are
nothing
better
than
a
wretched
little
worm
,
torn
in
two
with
*NL*
coughing
,
and
dying
slowly
of
your
own
malice
and
unbelief
.
What
did
*NL*
Gavrila
bring
you
over
here
for
?
They
're
all
against
me
,
even
to
my
own
*NL*
son

all
against
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
come

nonsense
!

cried
Gania
;
``
if
you
did
not
go
shaming
us
all

over
the
town

things
might
be
better
for

*NL*
*NL*
``
What

I

I
*NL*
can
only
do
you
honour

sir
;
I
can
not
shame
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
jumped
up
from
his
chair
in
a
fit
of
uncontrollable
rage
.
Gania
was
*NL*
very
angry
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Honour
,
indeed
!
''
said
the
latter
,
with
contempt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
say
,
sir
?
''
growled
the
general
,
taking
a
step
towards
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
that
I
have
but
to
open
my
mouth

and
you

*NL*
*NL*
Gania
began
,
but
did
not
finish
.
The
two
--
father
and
son
--
stood
before
*NL*
one
another
,
both
unspeakably
agitated
,
especially
Gania
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gania
,
Gania
,
reflect

cried
his
mother
,
hurriedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
nonsense
on
both
sides

snapped
out
Varia
.
``
Let

alone

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
only
for

sake
that
I
spare
him

said
Gania
,
tragically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak
!
''
said
the
general
,
beside
himself
with
rage
and
excitement
;
*NL*
``
speak

under
the
penalty
of
a
father
's
curse

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

's
curse
be
hanged

you
do
n't
frighten
me
that
way

said
*NL*
Gania
.
``
Whose
fault

it

March
hare

this

just
a

count

Take
care

now

do
n't
provoke
me
too
much

I
'll
tell
all

Why
did
you
go
to
the
*NL*
Epanchins

yesterday
--
tell
me
that
?
And
you
call
yourself
an
old
*NL*
man

too

with
grey
hair

*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
quiet

cried
Colia
.
``
Shut
up

you
fool

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
how
have
I
offended
him

repeated
Hippolyte
,
still
in
the
*NL*
same
jeering
voice
.
``
Why
does
he
call
me
a
screw
?
You
all
heard
it

He
*NL*
came
to
me
himself
and
began
telling
me
about
some
Captain
Eropegoff
.
*NL*
I
do
n't
wish
for
your
company

general
.
I
always
avoided
you

you
know
*NL*
that
.
What
have
I
to
do
with
Captain
Eropegoff
?
All
I
did
was
to
express
*NL*
my
opinion
that
probably
Captain
Eropegoff
never
existed
at
all
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
he
never
existed
!
''
Gania
interrupted
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
general
only
stood
stupefied
and
gazed
around
in
a
dazed
way
.
*NL*
Gania
's
speech
had
impressed
him
,
with
its
terrible
candour
.
For
the
*NL*
first
moment
or
two
he
could
find
no
words
to
answer
him
,
and
it
was
*NL*
only
when
Hippolyte
burst
out
laughing
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
you
see
!
Even
your
own
son
supports
my
statement
that
there
*NL*
never
was
such
a
person
as
Captain
Eropegoff
!
''
that
the
old
fellow
*NL*
muttered
confusedly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kapiton
Eropegoff
--
not
Captain
Eropegoff
!
--
Kapiton

major
*NL*
retired
--
Eropegoff
--
Kapiton

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kapiton
did
n't
exist
either

persisted
Gania
,
maliciously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
Did
n't
exist
?
''
cried
the
poor
general
,
and
a
deep
blush
suffused
*NL*
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
'll
do
,
Gania
!
''
cried
Varia
and
Ptitsin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shut
up
,
Gania
!
''
said
Colia
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
intercession
seemed
to
rekindle
the
general
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
you
mean

he
did

Explain
yourself

''
he
*NL*
repeated
,
angrily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
he
_
did
n't

exist
--
never
could

never
did

there
!
You
'd
better
*NL*
drop
the
subject

I
warn
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
this
is
my
son

my

I

gracious
Heaven

Eropegoff

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
,
ha
!
it
's
Eroshka
now

laughed
Hippolyte
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
Kapitoshka
--
not
Eroshka

I
mean
,
Kapiton
Alexeyevitch

retired
*NL*
major

Maria
Petrovna
Lu

Lu
--
he
was
my
friend
and
*NL*
companion
--
Lutugoff
--
from
our
earliest
beginnings
.
I
closed
his
eyes
for
*NL*
him
--
he
was
killed
.
Kapiton
Eropegoff
never
existed
!
tfu
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
general
shouted
in
his
fury
;
but
it
was
to
be
concluded
that
his
*NL*
wrath
was
not
kindled
by
the
expressed
doubt
as
to
Kapiton
's
existence
.
*NL*
This
was
his
scapegoat
;
but
his
excitement
was
caused
by
something
quite
*NL*
different
.
As
a
rule
he
would
have
merely
shouted
down
the
doubt
as
*NL*
to
Kapiton
,
told
a
long
yarn
about
his
friend
,
and
eventually
retired
*NL*
upstairs
to
his
room
.
But
today
,
in
the
strange
uncertainty
of
human
*NL*
nature
,
it
seemed
to
require
but
so
small
an
offence
as
this
to
make
*NL*
his
cup
to
overflow
.
The
old
man
grew
purple
in
the
face
,
he
raised
his
*NL*
hands
.
``
Enough
of
this
!
''
he
yelled
.
``
My
curse
--
away
,
out
of
the
house
*NL*
I
go
!
Colia
,
bring
my
bag
away
!
''
He
left
the
room
hastily
and
in
a
*NL*
paroxysm
of
rage
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
wife
,
Colia
,
and
Ptitsin
ran
out
after
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
you
done
now
?
''
said
Varia
to
Gania
.
``
He
'll
probably
be
making
*NL*
off
_
there
_
again
!
What
a
disgrace
it
all
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
he
should
n't
steal
,
''
cried
Gania
,
panting
with
fury
.
And
just
at
*NL*
this
moment
his
eye
met
Hippolyte
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
for
you
,
sir
,
''
he
cried
,
``
you
should
at
least
remember
that
you
are
*NL*
in
a
strange
house
and

receiving
hospitality
;
you
should
not
take
the
*NL*
opportunity
of
tormenting
an
old
man
,
sir
,
who
is
too
evidently
out
of
*NL*
his
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hippolyte
looked
furious
,
but
he
restrained
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
quite
agree
with
you
that
your
father
is
out
of
his
mind

he
*NL*
observed
,
quietly
.
``
On
the
contrary
,
I
can
not
help
thinking
he
has
been
*NL*
less
demented
of
late
.
Do
n't
you
think
so
?
He
has
grown
so
cunning
and
*NL*
careful
,
and
weighs
his
words
so
deliberately
;
he
spoke
to
me
about
that
*NL*
Kapiton
fellow
with
an
object
,
you
know
!
Just
fancy
--
he
wanted
me
to

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
devil
take
what
he
wanted
you
to
do
!
Do
n't
try
to
be
too
cunning
*NL*
with
me
,
young
man
!

shouted
Gania
.
``
If
you
are
aware
of
the
real
reason
*NL*
for
my
father
's
present
condition

you

kept
such
an
excellent
*NL*
spying
watch
during
these
last
few
days
that
you
are
sure
to
be
aware
of
*NL*
it

had
no

whatever
to
torment
the

unfortunate
man
,
and
to
*NL*
worry
my
mother
by
your
exaggerations
of
the
affair
;
because
the
whole
*NL*
business
is
nonsense

simply
a
drunken
freak
,
and
nothing
more
,
quite
*NL*
unproved
by
any
evidence

and
I
do
n't
believe

much

-LRB-
he
*NL*
snapped
his
fingers
-RRB-
.
``
But
you
must
needs
spy

watch
over
us
all

laughed
Hippolyte

*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
you
are
a
humbug

thought
fit
to
worry
people

half

an
hour

and
tried
to
frighten
them
into
believing
that
you
would
shoot
*NL*
yourself
with
your
little
empty
pistol
,
pirouetting
about
and
playing
at
*NL*
suicide
!
I
gave
you
hospitality

you
have
fattened
on
it

your
cough

*NL*
left
you

repay
all
this

*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse

Varvara
Ardalionovna
's
guest

have
extended
no
hospitality

On
the

if
I

not

Four
days
ago
I
begged
my
mother
to
come
down
here
and
find
*NL*
lodgings
,
because
I
certainly
do
feel
better
here
,
though
I
am
not
fat

have
I
ceased
to

I
am
today
informed

therefore
,
having
thanked
your
sister

for
their

kindness
to
me

I
intend
to
leave
the
house
this
evening

I
beg

interrupted

add
something

Oh

began
Gania

*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse

I
will
take
a

interrupted
Hippolyte
once
more
,
*NL*
sitting
down
deliberately
;
``
for
I
am
not
strong
yet

Now
then

I

is
the

very
likely
the
last
meeting
we

*NL*
*NL*
Gania
felt
a
little
guilty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
assure
you
I
did
not

up

As

that
*NL*
I
would
have
the
satisfaction
of
settling
accounts
with
you
in
a
very
*NL*
thorough
manner
before
I
said
good-bye

I

``

laughing

am
ready

an
explanation

become
an
absolute
necessity

coolly

Gania
was
silent

merely
looked
contemptuously
at

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

Very
well

I
shall
be
as
short
as

for

Two
*NL*
or
three
times
to-day
I
have
had
the
word
`
hospitality
'
pushed
down
my
*NL*
throat
;
this
is
not
fair
.
In
inviting
me
here
you
yourself
entrapped
*NL*
me
for
your
own
use
;
you
thought
I
wished
to
revenge
myself
upon
the
*NL*
prince
.
You
heard
that
Aglaya
Ivanovna
had
been
kind
to
me
and
read
my
*NL*
confession
.
Making
sure
that
I
should
give
myself
up
to
your
interests
,
*NL*
you
hoped
that
you
might
get
some
assistance
out
of
me
.
I
will
not
go
*NL*
into
details
.
I
do
n't
ask
either
admission
or
confirmation
of
this
from
*NL*
yourself
;
I
am
quite
content
to
leave
you
to
your
conscience
,
and
to
*NL*
feel
that
we
understand
one
another
capitally

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
history
you
are
weaving
out
of
the
most
ordinary
circumstances
!

*NL*
cried
Varia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
you
the
fellow
was
nothing

a
scandalmonger

Gania

Excuse
me

Varia

neither

respect
the
prince

though
he
is
a
good-hearted
fellow
,
*NL*
if
a
little
queer
.
But
there
is
no
need
whatever
for
me
to
hate
him

I
*NL*
quite
understood
your
brother
when
he
first
offered
me
aid
against
the
*NL*
prince
,
though
I
did
not
show
it
;
I
knew
well
that
your
brother
was
*NL*
making
a
ridiculous
mistake
in
me

I
am
ready
to
spare
him

however

*NL*
even
now

solely
out
of
respect
for
yourself

Having
now
shown
you
that
I
am
not

such
a

I
look

that
I
have
to
be
fished
for
with
a
rod
and
line
for
a
good
long
while
*NL*
before
I
am
caught
,
I
will
proceed
to
explain
why
I
specially
wished
to
*NL*
make
your
brother
look
a
fool

That
my
motive
power
is
hate
,
I
do
not
*NL*
attempt
to
conceal
.
I
have
felt
that
before
dying
-LRB-
and
I
am
dying
,
*NL*
however
much
fatter
I
may
appear
to
you
-RRB-
,
I
must
absolutely
make
a
fool
*NL*
of
,
at

,
one
of
that
class
of
men
which
has
dogged
me
all
my
life

*NL*
which
I
hate
so
cordially
,
and
which
is
so
prominently
represented
by
*NL*
your
much
esteemed
brother

I
should
not
enjoy
paradise
nearly
so
much
*NL*
without
having
done
this
first
.
I
hate
you
,
Gavrila
Ardalionovitch
,
*NL*
solely
-LRB-
this
may
seem
curious
to
you
,
but
I
repeat
-RRB-
--
solely
because
you
*NL*
are
the
type
,
and
incarnation
,
and
head
,
and
crown
of
the
most
impudent
,
*NL*
the
most
self-satisfied
,
the
most
vulgar
and
detestable
form
of
*NL*
commonplaceness

You
are
ordinary
of
the
ordinary
;
you
have
no
chance
of
*NL*
ever
fathering
the
pettiest
idea
of
your
own
.
And
yet
you
are
as
jealous
*NL*
and
conceited
as
you
can
possibly
be
;
you
consider
yourself
a
great
*NL*
genius
;
of
this
you
are
persuaded
,
although
there
are
dark
moments
of
*NL*
doubt
and
rage
,
when
even
this
fact
seems
uncertain

There
are
spots
*NL*
of
darkness
on
your
horizon
,
though
they
will
disappear
when
you
become
*NL*
completely
stupid

But
a
long
and
chequered
path
lies
before
you
,
and
*NL*
of
this
I
am
glad

In
the
first
place
you
will
never
gain
a
certain

person

Come

This

You

mischief-making
wretch

Varia

Gania
had
grown
very
pale
;
he
*NL*
trembled
,
but
said
nothing

*NL*
*NL*
Hippolyte
paused
,
and
looked
at
him
intently
and
with
great
*NL*
gratification
.
He
then
turned
his
gaze
upon
Varia
,
bowed
,
and
went
out
,
*NL*
without
adding
another
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gania
might
justly
complain
of
the
hardness
with
which
fate
treated
him
.
*NL*
Varia
dared
not
speak
to
him
for
a
long
while
,
as
he
strode
past
her
,
*NL*
backwards
and
forwards
.
At
last
he
went
and
stood
at
the
window
,
looking
*NL*
out
,
with
his
back
turned
towards
her
.
There
was
a
fearful
row
going
on
*NL*
upstairs
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
off
?
''
said
Gania
,
suddenly
,
remarking
that
she
had
risen
and
*NL*
was
about
to
leave
the
room
.
``
Wait
a
moment
--
look
at
this

*NL*
*NL*
He
approached
the
table
and
laid
a
small
sheet
of
paper
before
her
.
It
*NL*
looked
like
a
little
note
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
heavens

cried
Varia
,
raising
her
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
note
:

``
GAVRILA
ARDOLIONOVITCH

persuaded

morning
at

*NL*
Gania
,
little
as
he
felt
inclined
for
swagger
at
this
moment

could
*NL*
not
avoid
showing
his
triumph
,
especially
just
after
such
humiliating

remarks
as
those
of
Hippolyte

A
smile
of
self-satisfaction
beamed
on

his
face

Varia
too
was
brimming
over
with
delight

*NL*
Do
n't
swagger
again
and
lose
the
game
--
play
carefully
,
but
do
n't
funk
,
*NL*
do
you
understand
?
As
if
she
could
possibly
avoid
seeing
what
I
have
*NL*
been
working
for
all
this
last
six
months
!
And
just
imagine
,
I
was
there
*NL*
this
morning
and
not
a
word
of
this
!
I
was
there
,
you
know
,
on
the
sly
.
*NL*
The
old
lady
did
not
know
,
or
she
would
have
kicked
me
out
.
I
ran
some
*NL*
risk
for
you
,
you
see
.
I
did
so
want
to
find
out
,
at
all
hazards
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
there
was
a
frantic
noise
upstairs
once
more
;
several
people
seemed
*NL*
to
be
rushing
downstairs
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Gania
,
''
cried
Varia
,
frightened
,
``
we
ca
n't
let
him
go
out
!
We
*NL*
ca
n't
afford
to
have
a
breath
of
scandal
about
the
town
at
this
moment
.
*NL*
Run
after
him
and
beg
his
pardon
--
quick
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
father
of
the
family
was
out
in
the
road
already
.
Colia
was
*NL*
carrying
his
bag
for
him
;
Nina
Alexandrovna
stood
and
cried
on
the
*NL*
doorstep
;
she
wanted
to
run
after
the
general
,
but
Ptitsin
kept
her
*NL*
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
only
excite
him
more
,
''
he
said
.
``
He
has
nowhere
else
to
go
*NL*
to
--
he
'll
be
back
here
in
half
an
hour
.
I
've
talked
it
all
over
with
*NL*
Colia
;
let
him
play
the
fool
a
bit
,
it
will
do
him
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
up
to
?
Where
are
you
off
to
?
You
've
nowhere
to
go
to
,
you
*NL*
know
,
''
cried
Gania
,
out
of
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
back
,
father
;
the
neighbours
will
hear
!
''
cried
Varia
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
general
stopped
,
turned
round
,
raised
his
hands
and
remarked
:
``
My
*NL*
curse
be
upon
this
house
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
observation
should
always
be
made
in
as
theatrical
a
tone
as
*NL*
possible
,
''
muttered
Gania
,
shutting
the
window
with
a
bang
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
neighbours
undoubtedly
did
hear
.
Varia
rushed
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
sooner
had
his
sister
left
him
alone
,
than
Gania
took
the
note
out
of
*NL*
his
pocket
,
kissed
it
,
and
pirouetted
around
.
*NL*
*NL*
III
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
a
general
rule
,
old
General
Ivolgin
's
paroxysms
ended
in
smoke
.
He
*NL*
had
before
this
experienced
fits
of
sudden
fury
,
but
not
very
often
,
*NL*
because
he
was
really
a
man
of
peaceful
and
kindly
disposition
.
He
had
*NL*
tried
hundreds
of
times
to
overcome
the
dissolute
habits
which
he
had
*NL*
contracted
of
late
years
.
He
would
suddenly
remember
that
he
was
``
a
*NL*
father
,
''
would
be
reconciled
with
his
wife
,
and
shed
genuine
tears
.
*NL*
His
feeling
for
Nina
Alexandrovna
amounted
almost
to
adoration
;
she
had
*NL*
pardoned
so
much
in
silence
,
and
loved
him
still
in
spite
of
the
state
*NL*
of
degradation
into
which
he
had
fallen
.
But
the
general
's
struggles
*NL*
with
his
own
weakness
never
lasted
very
long
.
He
was
,
in
his
way
,
an
*NL*
impetuous
man
,
and
a
quiet
life
of
repentance
in
the
bosom
of
his
family
*NL*
soon
became
insupportable
to
him
.
In
the
end
he
rebelled
,
and
flew
into
*NL*
rages
which
he
regretted
,
perhaps
,
even
as
he
gave
way
to
them
,
but
*NL*
which
were
beyond
his
control
.
He
picked
quarrels
with
everyone
,
*NL*
began
to
hold
forth
eloquently
,
exacted
unlimited
respect
,
and
at
last
*NL*
disappeared
from
the
house
,
and
sometimes
did
not
return
for
a
long
*NL*
time
.
He
had
given
up
interfering
in
the
affairs
of
his
family
for
*NL*
two
years
now
,
and
knew
nothing
about
them
but
what
he
gathered
from
*NL*
hearsay
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
on
this
occasion
there
was
something
more
serious
than
usual
.
*NL*
Everyone
seemed
to
know
something
,
but
to
be
afraid
to
talk
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
general
had
turned
up
in
the
bosom
of
his
family
two
or
three
days
*NL*
before
,
but
not
,
as
usual
,
with
the
olive
branch
of
peace
in
his
hand
,
*NL*
not
in
the
garb
of
penitence
--
in
which
he
was
usually
clad
on
such
*NL*
occasions
--
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
in
an
uncommonly
bad
temper
.
He
had
*NL*
arrived
in
a
quarrelsome
mood
,
pitching
into
everyone
he
came
across
,
*NL*
and
talking
about
all
sorts
and
kinds
of
subjects
in
the
most
unexpected
*NL*
manner
,
so
that
it
was
impossible
to
discover
what
it
was
that
was
*NL*
really
putting
him
out
.
At
moments
he
would
be
apparently
quite
bright
*NL*
and
happy
;
but
as
a
rule
he
would
sit
moody
and
thoughtful
.
He
would
*NL*
abruptly
commence
to
hold
forth
about
the
Epanchins
,
about
Lebedeff
,
or
*NL*
the
prince
,
and
equally
abruptly
would
stop
short
and
refuse
to
speak
*NL*
another
word
,
answering
all
further
questions
with
a
stupid
smile
,
*NL*
unconscious
that
he
was
smiling
,
or
that
he
had
been
asked
a
question
.
*NL*
The
whole
of
the
previous
night
he
had
spent
tossing
about
and
groaning
,
*NL*
and
poor
Nina
Alexandrovna
had
been
busy
making
cold
compresses
and
warm
*NL*
fomentations
and
so
on
,
without
being
very
clear
how
to
apply
them
.
He
*NL*
had
fallen
asleep
after
a
while
,
but
not
for
long
,
and
had
awaked
in
*NL*
a
state
of
violent
hypochondria
which
had
ended
in
his
quarrel
with
*NL*
Hippolyte
,
and
the
solemn
cursing
of
Ptitsin
's
establishment
generally
.
*NL*
It
was
also
observed
during
those
two
or
three
days
that
he
was
in
a
*NL*
state
of
morbid
self-esteem
,
and
was
specially
touchy
on
all
points
of
*NL*
honour
.
Colia
insisted
,
in
discussing
the
matter
with
his
mother
,
that
*NL*
all
this
was
but
the
outcome
of
abstinence
from
drink
,
or
perhaps
of
*NL*
pining
after
Lebedeff
,
with
whom
up
to
this
time
the
general
had
been
*NL*
upon
terms
of
the
greatest
friendship
;
but
with
whom
,
for
some
reason
*NL*
or
other
,
he
had
quarrelled
a
few
days
since
,
parting
from
him
in
great
*NL*
wrath
.
There
had
also
been
a
scene
with
the
prince
.
Colia
had
asked
an
*NL*
explanation
of
the
latter
,
but
had
been
forced
to
conclude
that
he
was
*NL*
not
told
the
whole
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
Hippolyte
and
Nina
Alexandrovna
had
,
as
Gania
suspected
,
had
some
*NL*
special
conversation
about
the
general
's
actions
,
it
was
strange
that
*NL*
the
malicious
youth
,
whom
Gania
had
called
a
scandal-monger
to
his
face
,
*NL*
had
not
allowed
himself
a
similar
satisfaction
with
Colia
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fact
is
that
probably
Hippolyte
was
not
quite
so
black
as
Gania
*NL*
painted
him
;
and
it
was
hardly
likely
that
he
had
informed
Nina
*NL*
Alexandrovna
of
certain
events
,
of
which
we
know
,
for
the
mere
pleasure
*NL*
of
giving
her
pain
.
We
must
never
forget
that
human
motives
are
*NL*
generally
far
more
complicated
than
we
are
apt
to
suppose
,
and
that
we
*NL*
can
very
rarely
accurately
describe
the
motives
of
another
.
It
is
much
*NL*
better
for
the
writer
,
as
a
rule
,
to
content
himself
with
the
bare
*NL*
statement
of
events
;
and
we
shall
take
this
line
with
regard
to
the
*NL*
catastrophe
recorded
above
,
and
shall
state
the
remaining
events
*NL*
connected
with
the
general
's
trouble
shortly
,
because
we
feel
that
*NL*
we
have
already
given
to
this
secondary
character
in
our
story
more
*NL*
attention
than
we
originally
intended
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
course
of
events
had
marched
in
the
following
order
.
When
Lebedeff
*NL*
returned
,
in
company
with
the
general
,
after
their
expedition
to
town
a
*NL*
few
days
since
,
for
the
purpose
of
investigation
,
he
brought
the
prince
*NL*
no
information
whatever
.
If
the
latter
had
not
himself
been
occupied
*NL*
with
other
thoughts
and
impressions
at
the
time
,
he
must
have
observed
*NL*
that
Lebedeff
not
only
was
very
uncommunicative
,
but
even
appeared
*NL*
anxious
to
avoid
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
prince
did
give
the
matter
a
little
attention
,
he
recalled
*NL*
the
fact
that
during
these
days
he
had
always
found
Lebedeff
to
be
in
*NL*
radiantly
good
spirits
,
when
they
happened
to
meet
;
and
further
,
that
*NL*
the
general
and
Lebedeff
were
always
together
.
The
two
friends
did
not
*NL*
seem
ever
to
be
parted
for
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Occasionally
the
prince
heard
loud
talking
and
laughing
upstairs
,
and
*NL*
once
he
detected
the
sound
of
a
jolly
soldier
's
song
going
on
above
,
and
*NL*
recognized
the
unmistakable
bass
of
the
general
's
voice
.
But
the
sudden
*NL*
outbreak
of
song
did
not
last
;
and
for
an
hour
afterwards
the
animated
*NL*
sound
of
apparently
drunken
conversation
continued
to
be
heard
from
*NL*
above
.
At
length
there
was
the
clearest
evidence
of
a
grand
mutual
*NL*
embracing
,
and
someone
burst
into
tears
.
Shortly
after
this
,
however
,
*NL*
there
was
a
violent
but
short-lived
quarrel
,
with
loud
talking
on
both
*NL*
sides
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
these
days
Colia
had
been
in
a
state
of
great
mental
preoccupation
.
*NL*
Muishkin
was
usually
out
all
day
,
and
only
came
home
late
at
night
.
On
*NL*
his
return
he
was
invariably
informed
that
Colia
had
been
looking
for
*NL*
him
.
However
,
when
they
did
meet
,
Colia
never
had
anything
particular
to
*NL*
tell
him
,
excepting
that
he
was
highly
dissatisfied
with
the
general
and
*NL*
his
present
condition
of
mind
and
behaviour
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
drag
each
other
about
the
place
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
get
drunk
together
*NL*
at
the
pub
close
by
here
,
and
quarrel
in
the
street
on
the
way
home
,
and
*NL*
embrace
one
another
after
it
,
and
do
n't
seem
to
part
for
a
moment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
prince
pointed
out
that
there
was
nothing
new
about
that
,
for
*NL*
that
they
had
always
behaved
in
this
manner
together
,
Colia
did
not
know
*NL*
what
to
say
;
in
fact
he
could
not
explain
what
it
was
that
specially
*NL*
worried
him
,
just
now
,
about
his
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
morning
following
the
bacchanalian
songs
and
quarrels
recorded
*NL*
above
,
as
the
prince
stepped
out
of
the
house
at
about
eleven
o'clock
,
*NL*
the
general
suddenly
appeared
before
him
,
much
agitated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
long
sought
the
honour
and
opportunity
of
meeting
*NL*
you
--
much-esteemed
Lef
Nicolaievitch
,
''
he
murmured
,
pressing
the
*NL*
prince
's
hand
very
hard
,
almost
painfully
so
;
``
long
--
very
long
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
begged
him
to
step
in
and
sit
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
I
will
not
sit
down
,
--
I
am
keeping
you
,
I
see
,
--
another
time
!
--
I
*NL*
think
I
may
be
permitted
to
congratulate
you
upon
the
realization
of
*NL*
your
heart
's
best
wishes
,
is
it
not
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
best
wishes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
blushed
.
He
thought
,
as
so
many
in
his
position
do
,
that
*NL*
nobody
had
seen
,
heard
,
noticed
,
or
understood
anything
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
be
easy
,
sir
,
be
easy
!
I
shall
not
wound
your
tenderest
feelings
.
*NL*
I
've
been
through
it
all
myself
,
and
I
know
well
how
unpleasant
it
is
*NL*
when
an
outsider
sticks
his
nose
in
where
he
is
not
wanted
.
I
experience
*NL*
this
every
morning
.
I
came
to
speak
to
you
about
another
matter
,
though
,
*NL*
an
important
matter
.
A
very
important
matter
,
prince
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
requested
him
to
take
a
seat
once
more
,
and
sat
down
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
just
for
one
second
,
then
.
The
fact
is
,
I
came
for
advice
.
Of
*NL*
course
I
live
now
without
any
very
practical
objects
in
life
;
but
,
*NL*
being
full
of
self-respect
,
in
which
quality
the
ordinary
Russian
is
so
*NL*
deficient
as
a
rule
,
and
of
activity
,
I
am
desirous
,
in
a
word
,
prince
,
*NL*
of
placing
myself
and
my
wife
and
children
in
a
position
of
--
in
fact
,
I
*NL*
want
advice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
commended
his
aspirations
with
warmth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
so
--
quite
so
!
But
this
is
all
mere
nonsense
.
I
came
here
to
speak
*NL*
of
something
quite
different
,
something
very
important
,
prince
.
And
*NL*
I
have
determined
to
come
to
you
as
to
a
man
in
whose
sincerity
and
*NL*
nobility
of
feeling
I
can
trust
like
--
like
--
are
you
surprised
at
my
*NL*
words
,
prince
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
was
watching
his
guest
,
if
not
with
much
surprise
,
at
all
*NL*
events
with
great
attention
and
curiosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
was
very
pale
;
every
now
and
then
his
lips
trembled
,
and
his
*NL*
hands
seemed
unable
to
rest
quietly
,
but
continually
moved
from
place
to
*NL*
place
.
He
had
twice
already
jumped
up
from
his
chair
and
sat
down
again
*NL*
without
being
in
the
least
aware
of
it
.
He
would
take
up
a
book
from
*NL*
the
table
and
open
it
--
talking
all
the
while
,
--
look
at
the
heading
of
a
*NL*
chapter
,
shut
it
and
put
it
back
again
,
seizing
another
immediately
,
but
*NL*
holding
it
unopened
in
his
hand
,
and
waving
it
in
the
air
as
he
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
enough
!
''
he
cried
,
suddenly
.
``
I
see
I
have
been
boring
you
with
*NL*
my

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
in
the
least
--
not
in
the
least
,
I
assure
you
.
On
the
contrary
,
I
am
*NL*
listening
most
attentively
,
and
am
anxious
to

``
Prince
,
I
wish
to
place
myself
in
a
respectable
position
--
I
wish
to
*NL*
esteem
myself
--
and
to
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
sir
,
a
man
of
such
noble
aspirations
is
worthy
of
all
esteem
by
*NL*
virtue
of
those
aspirations
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
brought
out
his
``
copy-book
sentence
''
in
the
firm
belief
that
*NL*
it
would
produce
a
good
effect
.
He
felt
instinctively
that
some
such
*NL*
well-sounding
humbug
,
brought
out
at
the
proper
moment
,
would
soothe
the
*NL*
old
man
's
feelings
,
and
would
be
specially
acceptable
to
such
a
man
in
*NL*
such
a
position
.
At
all
hazards
,
his
guest
must
be
despatched
with
heart
*NL*
relieved
and
spirit
comforted
;
that
was
the
problem
before
the
prince
at
*NL*
this
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
phrase
flattered
the
general
,
touched
him
,
and
pleased
him
mightily
.
*NL*
He
immediately
changed
his
tone
,
and
started
off
on
a
long
and
solemn
*NL*
explanation
.
But
listen
as
he
would
,
the
prince
could
make
neither
head
*NL*
nor
tail
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
general
spoke
hotly
and
quickly
for
ten
minutes
;
he
spoke
as
though
*NL*
his
words
could
not
keep
pace
with
his
crowding
thoughts
.
Tears
stood
*NL*
in
his
eyes
,
and
yet
his
speech
was
nothing
but
a
collection
of
*NL*
disconnected
sentences
,
without
beginning
and
without
end
--
a
string
of
*NL*
unexpected
words
and
unexpected
sentiments
--
colliding
with
one
another
,
*NL*
and
jumping
over
one
another
,
as
they
burst
from
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Enough
!
''
he
concluded
at
last
,
``
you
understand
me
,
and
that
is
the
*NL*
great
thing
.
A
heart
like
yours
can
not
help
understanding
the
sufferings
*NL*
of
another
.
Prince
,
you
are
the
ideal
of
generosity
;
what
are
other
men
*NL*
beside
yourself
?
But
you
are
young
--
accept
my
blessing
!
My
*NL*
principal
object
is
to
beg
you
to
fix
an
hour
for
a
most
important
*NL*
conversation
--
that
is
my
great
hope
,
prince
.
My
heart
needs
but
a
little
*NL*
friendship
and
sympathy
,
and
yet
I
can
not
always
find
means
to
satisfy
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
not
now
?
I
am
ready
to
listen
,
and
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

no

prince

not
now

Now
is
a
dream

And
it
is
too
,
too
important
!
*NL*
It
is
to
be
the
hour
of
Fate
to
me
--
_
my
own
_
hour
.
Our
interview
is
not
*NL*
to
be
broken
in
upon
by
every
chance
comer
,
every
impertinent
guest
--
and
*NL*
there
are
plenty
of
such
stupid
,
impertinent
fellows
''
--
-LRB-
he
bent
over
and
*NL*
whispered
mysteriously
,
with
a
funny
,
frightened
look
on
his
face
-RRB-
--
``
who
*NL*
are
unworthy
to
tie
your
shoe
,
prince
.
I
do
n't
say
_
mine
_
,
mind
--
you
will
*NL*
understand
me
,
prince
.
Only
_
you
_
understand
me
,
prince
--
no
one
else
.
*NL*
_
He
_
does
n't
understand
me
,
he
is
absolutely
--
_
absolutely
_
unable
to
*NL*
sympathize
.
The
first
qualification
for
understanding
another
is
Heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
was
rather
alarmed
at
all
this
,
and
was
obliged
to
end
by
*NL*
appointing
the
same
hour
of
the
following
day
for
the
interview
desired
.
*NL*
The
general
left
him
much
comforted
and
far
less
agitated
than
when
he
*NL*
had
arrived
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
seven
in
the
evening
,
the
prince
sent
to
request
Lebedeff
to
pay
*NL*
him
a
visit
.
Lebedeff
came
at
once
,
and
``
esteemed
it
an
honour
,
''
as
he
*NL*
observed
,
the
instant
he
entered
the
room
.
He
acted
as
though
there
*NL*
had
never
been
the
slightest
suspicion
of
the
fact
that
he
had
*NL*
systematically
avoided
the
prince
for
the
last
three
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
his
chair
,
smiling
and
making
faces
,
*NL*
and
rubbing
his
hands
,
and
looking
as
though
he
were
in
delighted
*NL*
expectation
of
hearing
some
important
communication
,
which
had
been
long
*NL*
guessed
by
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
was
instantly
covered
with
confusion
;
for
it
appeared
to
be
*NL*
plain
that
everyone
expected
something
of
him
--
that
everyone
looked
at
*NL*
him
as
though
anxious
to
congratulate
him
,
and
greeted
him
with
hints
,
*NL*
and
smiles
,
and
knowing
looks
.
*NL*
*NL*
Keller
,
for
instance
,
had
run
into
the
house
three
times
of
late
,
``
just
*NL*
for
a
moment
,
''
and
each
time
with
the
air
of
desiring
to
offer
his
*NL*
congratulations
.
Colia
,
too
,
in
spite
of
his
melancholy
,
had
once
*NL*
or
twice
begun
sentences
in
much
the
same
strain
of
suggestion
or
*NL*
insinuation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
,
however
,
immediately
began
,
with
some
show
of
annoyance
,
to
*NL*
question
Lebedeff
categorically
,
as
to
the
general
's
present
condition
,
*NL*
and
his
opinion
thereon
.
He
described
the
morning
's
interview
in
a
few
*NL*
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everyone
has
his
worries
,
prince
,
especially
in
these
strange
and
*NL*
troublous
times
of
ours
,
''
Lebedeff
replied
,
drily
,
and
with
the
air
of
a
*NL*
man
disappointed
of
his
reasonable
expectations
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
me
,
what
a
philosopher
you
are
!
''
laughed
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Philosophy
is
necessary
,
sir
--
very
necessary
--
in
our
day
.
It
is
too
*NL*
much
neglected
.
As
for
me
,
much
esteemed
prince
,
I
am
sensible
of
having
*NL*
experienced
the
honour
of
your
confidence
in
a
certain
matter
up
to
*NL*
a
certain
point
,
but
never
beyond
that
point
.
I
do
not
for
a
moment
*NL*
complain
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lebedeff
,
you
seem
to
be
angry
for
some
reason
!
''
said
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
the
least
bit
in
the
world
,
esteemed
and
revered
prince
!
Not
the
*NL*
least
bit
in
the
world
!
''
cried
Lebedeff
,
solemnly
,
with
his
hand
upon
*NL*
his
heart
.
``
On
the
contrary
,
I
am
too
painfully
aware
that
neither
by
my
*NL*
position
in
the
world
,
nor
by
my
gifts
of
intellect
and
heart
,
nor
by
*NL*
my
riches
,
nor
by
any
former
conduct
of
mine
,
have
I
in
any
way
deserved
*NL*
your
confidence
,
which
is
far
above
my
highest
aspirations
and
hopes
.
*NL*
Oh
no
,
prince
;
I
may
serve
you
,
but
only
as
your
humble
slave
!
I
am
not
*NL*
angry
,
oh
no
!
Not
angry
;
pained
perhaps
,
but
nothing
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Lebedeff
,
I
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
nothing
more
,
nothing
more
!
I
was
saying
to
myself
but
now
...
'
I
am
*NL*
quite
unworthy
of
friendly
relations
with
him
,
'
say
I
;
`
but
perhaps
as
*NL*
landlord
of
this
house
I
may
,
at
some
future
date
,
in
his
good
time
,
*NL*
receive
information
as
to
certain
imminent
and
much
to
be
desired
*NL*
changes
--
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
Lebedeff
fixed
the
prince
with
his
sharp
little
eyes
,
still
in
*NL*
hope
that
he
would
get
his
curiosity
satisfied
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
looked
back
at
him
in
amazement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
what
you
are
driving
at
!
''
he
cried
,
almost
angrily
,
*NL*
``
and
,
and
--
what
an
intriguer
you
are
,
Lebedeff
!
''
he
added
,
bursting
into
*NL*
a
fit
of
genuine
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lebedeff
followed
suit
at
once
,
and
it
was
clear
from
his
radiant
face
*NL*
that
he
considered
his
prospects
of
satisfaction
immensely
improved
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
know
,
''
the
prince
continued
,
``
I
am
amazed
at
your
naive
*NL*
ways
,
Lebedeff
!
Do
n't
be
angry
with
me
--
not
only
yours
,
everybody
else
's
*NL*
also
!
You
are
waiting
to
hear
something
from
me
at
this
very
moment
with
*NL*
such
simplicity
that
I
declare
I
feel
quite
ashamed
of
myself
for
having
*NL*
nothing
whatever
to
tell
you
.
I
swear
to
you
solemnly
,
that
there
is
*NL*
nothing
to
tell
.
There
!
Can
you
take
that
in
?
''
The
prince
laughed
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lebedeff
assumed
an
air
of
dignity
.
It
was
true
enough
that
he
was
*NL*
sometimes
naive
to
a
degree
in
his
curiosity
;
but
he
was
also
an
*NL*
excessively
cunning
gentleman
,
and
the
prince
was
almost
converting
*NL*
him
into
an
enemy
by
his
repeated
rebuffs
.
The
prince
did
not
snub
*NL*
Lebedeff
's
curiosity
,
however
,
because
he
felt
any
contempt
for
him
;
but
*NL*
simply
because
the
subject
was
too
delicate
to
talk
about
.
Only
a
few
*NL*
days
before
he
had
looked
upon
his
own
dreams
almost
as
crimes
.
But
*NL*
Lebedeff
considered
the
refusal
as
caused
by
personal
dislike
to
*NL*
himself
,
and
was
hurt
accordingly
.
Indeed
,
there
was
at
this
moment
a
*NL*
piece
of
news
,
most
interesting
to
the
prince
,
which
Lebedeff
knew
*NL*
and
even
had
wished
to
tell
him
,
but
which
he
now
kept
obstinately
to
*NL*
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
can
I
do
for
you
,
esteemed
prince
?
Since
I
am
told
you
sent
*NL*
for
me
just
now
,
''
he
said
,
after
a
few
moments
'
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
was
about
the
general
,
''
began
the
prince
,
waking
abruptly
from
*NL*
the
fit
of
musing
which
he
too
had
indulged
in
``
and
--
and
about
the
theft
*NL*
you
told
me
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
--
er
--
about
--
what
theft
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
come
!
just
as
if
you
did
n't
understand
,
Lukian
Timofeyovitch
!
What
*NL*
are
you
up
to
?
I
ca
n't
make
you
out
!
The
money
,
the
money
,
sir
!
The
four
*NL*
hundred
roubles
that
you
lost
that
day
.
You
came
and
told
me
about
*NL*
it
one
morning
,
and
then
went
off
to
Petersburg
.
There
,
_
now
_
do
you
*NL*
understand
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
h
--
h
!
You
mean
the
four
hundred
roubles
!
''
said
Lebedeff
,
dragging
*NL*
the
words
out
,
just
as
though
it
had
only
just
dawned
upon
him
what
*NL*
the
prince
was
talking
about
.
``
Thanks
very
much
,
prince
,
for
your
kind
*NL*
interest

you
do
me
too
much
honour

I
found
the
money
,
long
ago
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
found
it
?
Thank
God
for
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
exclamation
proves
the
generous
sympathy
of
your
nature
,
prince
;
*NL*
for
four
hundred
roubles
--
to
a
struggling
family
man
like
myself
--
is
no
*NL*
small
matter
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
mean
that

at
least
,
of
course

I
'm
glad
for
your
sake

''
*NL*
added
the
prince
,
correcting
himself
,
``
but
--
how
did
you
find
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
simply
indeed
!
I
found
it
under
the
chair
upon
which
my
coat
had
*NL*
hung
;
so
that
it
is
clear
the
purse
simply
fell
out
of
the
pocket
and
on
*NL*
to
the
floor
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Under
the
chair
?
Impossible
!
Why
,
you
told
me
yourself
that
you
had
*NL*
searched
every
corner
of
the
room
?
How
could
you
not
have
looked
in
the
*NL*
most
likely
place
of
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
looked
there
,

of
course
I
did

Very
much
so
!
I
looked
and
*NL*
scrambled
about
,
and
felt
for
it
,
and
would
n't
believe
it
was
not
there
,
*NL*
and
looked
again
and
again
.
It
is
always
so
in
such
cases
.
One
longs
and
*NL*
expects
to
find
a
lost
article
;
one
sees
it
is
not
there
,
and
the
place
*NL*
is
as
bare
as
one
's
palm
;
and
yet
one
returns
and
looks
again
and
again
,
*NL*
fifteen
or
twenty
times
,
likely
enough
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
quite
so
,
of
course

But
how
was
it
in
your
case
?
--
I
do
n't
quite
*NL*
understand
,
''
said
the
bewildered
prince
.
``
You
say
it
was
n't
there
at
*NL*
first

that
you
searched
the
place
thoroughly

it
turned
up
*NL*
on
that
very
spot

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

sir

on

very
spot

The
prince
gazed
strangely
at
Lebedeff
.
*NL*
``
And
the
general

he
asked
,
abruptly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The

the

How
do
you
mean

said
Lebedeff
,
*NL*
dubiously
,
as
though
he
had
not
taken
in
the
drift
of
the
prince
's
*NL*
remark
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
good
heavens
!
I
mean

chair

for

there

had
n't
you
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
so

together

But
the
second

I
thought
better
to
say
nothing
*NL*
about

found
it
alone

*NL*
*NL*
``
But

why
in

the
money

Was
it
all
there

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
opened
the
purse

counted
it
myself

right
to

single
rouble

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you

have
come

thoughtfully

most

I
took

it

?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
just
out
of
curiosity
,
''
said
Lebedeff
,
rubbing
his
hands
and
*NL*
sniggering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
it
's
still
there
then
,
is
it
?
Ever
since
the
day
before
*NL*
yesterday
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
!
You
see
,
I
was
half
in
hopes
the
general
might
find
it
.
Because
*NL*
if
I
found
it
,
why
should
not
he
too
observe
an
object
lying
before
his
*NL*
very
eyes
?
I
moved
the
chair
several
times
so
as
to
expose
the
purse
*NL*
to
view
,
but
the
general
never
saw
it
.
He
is
very
absent
just
now
,
*NL*
evidently
.
He
talks
and
laughs
and
tells
stories
,
and
suddenly
flies
*NL*
into
a
rage
with
me
,
goodness
knows
why
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
but
--
have
you
taken
the
purse
away
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
disappeared
from
under
the
chair
in
the
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
it
now
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
''
laughed
Lebedeff
,
at
last
,
rising
to
his
full
height
and
looking
*NL*
pleasantly
at
the
prince
,
``
here
,
in
the
lining
of
my
coat
.
Look
,
you
can
*NL*
feel
it
for
yourself
,
if
you
like
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sure
enough
there
was
something
sticking
out
of
the
front
of
the
*NL*
coat
--
something
large
.
It
certainly
felt
as
though
it
might
well
be
the
*NL*
purse
fallen
through
a
hole
in
the
pocket
into
the
lining
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
took
it
out
and
had
a
look
at
it
;
it
's
all
right
.
I
've
let
it
slip
*NL*
back
into
the
lining
now
,
as
you
see
,
and
so
I
have
been
walking
about
*NL*
ever
since
yesterday
morning
;
it
knocks
against
my
legs
when
I
walk
*NL*
along
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
H
'm
!
and
you
take
no
notice
of
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
so
,
I
take
no
notice
of
it
.
Ha
,
ha
!
and
think
of
this
,
prince
,
*NL*
my
pockets
are
always
strong
and
whole
,
and
yet
,
here
in
one
night
,
is
a
*NL*
huge
hole
.
I
know
the
phenomenon
is
unworthy
of
your
notice
;
but
such
is
*NL*
the
case
.
I
examined
the
hole
,
and
I
declare
it
actually
looks
as
though
*NL*
it
had
been
made
with
a
pen-knife
,
a
most
improbable
contingency
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
--
and
--
the
general
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
very
angry
all
day
,
sir
;
all
yesterday
and
all
today
.
He
shows
*NL*
decided
bacchanalian
predilections
at
one
time
,
and
at
another
is
*NL*
tearful
and
sensitive
,
but
at
any
moment
he
is
liable
to
paroxysms
of
*NL*
such
rage
that
I
assure
you
,
prince
,
I
am
quite
alarmed
.
I
am
not
*NL*
a
military
man
,
you
know
.
Yesterday
we
were
sitting
together
in
*NL*
the
tavern
,
and
the
lining
of
my
coat
was
--
quite
accidentally
,
of
*NL*
course
--
sticking
out
right
in
front
.
The
general
squinted
at
it
,
and
*NL*
flew
into
a
rage
.
He
never
looks
me
quite
in
the
face
now
,
unless
he
is
*NL*
very
drunk
or
maudlin
;
but
yesterday
he
looked
at
me
in
such
a
way
that
*NL*
a
shiver
went
all
down
my
back
.
I
intend
to
find
the
purse
tomorrow
;
but
*NL*
till
then
I
am
going
to
have
another
night
of
it
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
good
of
tormenting
him
like
this
?
''
cried
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
torment
him
,
prince
,
I
do
n't
indeed
!
''
cried
Lebedeff
,
hotly
.
``
I
*NL*
love
him
,
my
dear
sir
,
I
esteem
him
;
and
believe
it
or
not
,
I
love
him
*NL*
all
the
better
for
this
business
,
yes
--
and
value
him
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lebedeff
said
this
so
seriously
that
the
prince
quite
lost
his
temper
*NL*
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
!
love
him
and
torment
him
so
!
Why
,
by
the
very
fact
that
he
*NL*
put
the
purse
prominently
before
you
,
first
under
the
chair
and
then
*NL*
in
your
lining
,
he
shows
that
he
does
not
wish
to
deceive
you
,
but
is
*NL*
anxious
to
beg
your
forgiveness
in
this
artless
way
.
Do
you
hear
?
He
is
*NL*
asking
your
pardon
.
He
confides
in
the
delicacy
of
your
feelings
,
and
*NL*
in
your
friendship
for
him
.
And
you
can
allow
yourself
to
humiliate
so
*NL*
thoroughly
honest
a
man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thoroughly
honest
,
quite
so
,
prince
,
thoroughly
honest
!
''
said
Lebedeff
,
*NL*
with
flashing
eyes
.
``
And
only
you
,
prince
,
could
have
found
so
very
*NL*
appropriate
an
expression
.
I
honour
you
for
it
,
prince
.
Very
well
,
*NL*
that
's
settled
;
I
shall
find
the
purse
now
and
not
tomorrow
.
Here
,
I
*NL*
find
it
and
take
it
out
before
your
eyes
!
And
the
money
is
all
right
.
*NL*
Take
it
,
prince
,
and
keep
it
till
tomorrow
,
will
you
?
Tomorrow
or
next
*NL*
day
I
'll
take
it
back
again
.
I
think
,
prince
,
that
the
night
after
*NL*
its
disappearance
it
was
buried
under
a
bush
in
the
garden
.
So
I
*NL*
believe
--
what
do
you
think
of
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
take
care
you
do
n't
tell
him
to
his
face
that
you
have
found
the
*NL*
purse
.
Simply
let
him
see
that
it
is
no
longer
in
the
lining
of
your
*NL*
coat
,
and
form
his
own
conclusions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
so
?
Had
I
not
just
better
tell
him
I
have
found
it
,
and
*NL*
pretend
I
never
guessed
where
it
was
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
n't
think
so
,
''
said
the
prince
,
thoughtfully
;
``
it
's
too
late
*NL*
for
that
--
that
would
be
dangerous
now
.
No
,
no
!
Better
say
nothing
about
*NL*
it
.
Be
nice
with
him
,
you
know
,
but
do
n't
show
him
--
oh
,
_
you
_
know
well
*NL*
enough
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
,
prince
,
of
course
I
know
,
but
I
'm
afraid
I
shall
not
carry
*NL*
it
out
;
for
to
do
so
one
needs
a
heart
like
your
own
.
He
is
so
very
*NL*
irritable
just
now
,
and
so
proud
.
At
one
moment
he
will
embrace
me
,
*NL*
and
the
next
he
flies
out
at
me
and
sneers
at
me
,
and
then
I
stick
the
*NL*
lining
forward
on
purpose
.
Well
,
_
au
revoir
_
,
prince
,
I
see
I
am
keeping
*NL*
you
,
and
boring
you
,
too
,
interfering
with
your
most
interesting
private
*NL*
reflections
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
do
be
careful
!
Secrecy
,
as
before
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
silence
is
n't
the
word
!
Softly
,
softly
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
in
spite
of
this
conclusion
to
the
episode
,
the
prince
remained
as
*NL*
puzzled
as
ever
,
if
not
more
so
.
He
awaited
next
morning
's
interview
*NL*
with
the
general
most
impatiently
.
*NL*
*NL*
IV
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
time
appointed
was
twelve
o'clock
,
and
the
prince
,
returning
home
*NL*
unexpectedly
late
,
found
the
general
waiting
for
him
.
At
the
first
*NL*
glance
,
he
saw
that
the
latter
was
displeased
,
perhaps
because
he
had
*NL*
been
kept
waiting
.
The
prince
apologized
,
and
quickly
took
a
seat
.
He
*NL*
seemed
strangely
timid
before
the
general
this
morning
,
for
some
reason
,
*NL*
and
felt
as
though
his
visitor
were
some
piece
of
china
which
he
was
*NL*
afraid
of
breaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
scrutinizing
him
,
the
prince
soon
saw
that
the
general
was
quite
a
*NL*
different
man
from
what
he
had
been
the
day
before
;
he
looked
like
one
*NL*
who
had
come
to
some
momentous
resolve
.
His
calmness
,
however
,
was
more
*NL*
apparent
than
real
.
He
was
courteous
,
but
there
was
a
suggestion
of
*NL*
injured
innocence
in
his
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
brought
your
book
back
,
''
he
began
,
indicating
a
book
lying
on
the
*NL*
table
.
``
Much
obliged
to
you
for
lending
it
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
yes
.
Well
,
did
you
read
it
,
general
?
It
's
curious
,
is
n't
it
?
''
said
*NL*
the
prince
,
delighted
to
be
able
to
open
up
conversation
upon
an
outside
*NL*
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Curious
enough
,
yes
,
but
crude
,
and
of
course
dreadful
nonsense
;
*NL*
probably
the
man
lies
in
every
other
sentence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
general
spoke
with
considerable
confidence
,
and
dragged
his
words
*NL*
out
with
a
conceited
drawl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
it
's
only
the
simple
tale
of
an
old
soldier
who
saw
the
French
*NL*
enter
Moscow
.
Some
of
his
remarks
were
wonderfully
interesting
.
Remarks
*NL*
of
an
eye-witness
are
always
valuable
,
whoever
he
be
,
do
n't
you
think
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Had
I
been
the
publisher
I
should
not
have
printed
it
.
As
to
the
*NL*
evidence
of
eye-witnesses
,
in
these
days
people
prefer
impudent
lies
to
*NL*
the
stories
of
men
of
worth
and
long
service
.
I
know
of
some
notes
of
*NL*
the
year
1812
,
which
--
I
have
determined
,
prince
,
to
leave
this
house
,
*NL*
Mr.
Lebedeff
's
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
general
looked
significantly
at
his
host
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
you
have
your
own
lodging
at
Pavlofsk
at
--
at
your
daughter
's
*NL*
house
,
''
began
the
prince
,
quite
at
a
loss
what
to
say
.
He
suddenly
*NL*
recollected
that
the
general
had
come
for
advice
on
a
most
important
*NL*
matter
,
affecting
his
destiny
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
my
wife
's
;
in
other
words
,
at
my
own
place
,
my
daughter
's
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
I
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
leave
Lebedeff
's
house
,
my
dear
prince
,
because
I
have
quarrelled
*NL*
with
this
person
.
I
broke
with
him
last
night
,
and
am
very
sorry
that
I
*NL*
did
not
do
so
before
.
I
expect
respect
,
prince
,
even
from
those
to
whom
*NL*
I
give
my
heart
,
so
to
speak
.
Prince
,
I
have
often
given
away
my
heart
,
*NL*
and
am
nearly
always
deceived
.
This
person
was
quite
unworthy
of
the
*NL*
gift
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
much
that
might
be
improved
in
him
,
''
said
the
prince
,
*NL*
moderately
,
``
but
he
has
some
qualities
which
--
though
amid
them
one
*NL*
can
not
but
discern
a
cunning
nature
--
reveal
what
is
often
a
diverting
*NL*
intellect
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
's
tone
was
so
natural
and
respectful
that
the
general
could
*NL*
not
possibly
suspect
him
of
any
insincerity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
he
possesses
good
traits
,
I
was
the
first
to
show
,
when
I
very
*NL*
nearly
made
him
a
present
of
my
friendship
.
I
am
not
dependent
upon
his
*NL*
hospitality
,
and
upon
his
house
;
I
have
my
own
family
.
I
do
not
attempt
*NL*
to
justify
my
own
weakness
.
I
have
drunk
with
this
man
,
and
perhaps
I
*NL*
deplore
the
fact
now
,
but
I
did
not
take
him
up
for
the
sake
of
drink
*NL*
alone
-LRB-
excuse
the
crudeness
of
the
expression
,
prince
-RRB-
;
I
did
not
make
*NL*
friends
with
him
for
that
alone
.
I
was
attracted
by
his
good
qualities
;
*NL*
but
when
the
fellow
declares
that
he
was
a
child
in
1812
,
and
had
his
*NL*
left
leg
cut
off
,
and
buried
in
the
Vagarkoff
cemetery
,
in
Moscow
,
*NL*
such
a
cock-and-bull
story
amounts
to
disrespect
,
my
dear
sir
,
to
--
to
*NL*
impudent
exaggeration
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
he
was
very
likely
joking
;
he
said
it
for
fun
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
quite
understand
you
.
You
mean
that
an
innocent
lie
for
the
sake
of
a
*NL*
good
joke
is
harmless
,
and
does
not
offend
the
human
heart
.
Some
people
*NL*
lie
,
if
you
like
to
put
it
so
,
out
of
pure
friendship
,
in
order
to
amuse
*NL*
their
fellows
;
but
when
a
man
makes
use
of
extravagance
in
order
to
show
*NL*
his
disrespect
and
to
make
clear
how
the
intimacy
bores
him
,
it
is
time
*NL*
for
a
man
of
honour
to
break
off
the
said
intimacy.
,
and
to
teach
the
*NL*
offender
his
place

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
general
flushed
with
indignation
as
he
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
Lebedeff
can
not
have
been
in
Moscow
in
1812
.
He
is
much
too
*NL*
young
;
it
is
all
nonsense
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
but
even
if
we
admit
that
he
_
was
_
alive
in
1812
,
can
one
*NL*
believe
that
a
French
chasseur
pointed
a
cannon
at
him
for
a
lark
,
and
*NL*
shot
his
left
leg
off
?
He
says
he
picked
his
own
leg
up
and
took
it
away
*NL*
and
buried
it
in
the
cemetery
.
He
swore
he
had
a
stone
put
up
over
*NL*
it
with
the
inscription
:
`
Here
lies
the
leg
of
Collegiate
Secretary
*NL*
Lebedeff

and
on
the
other
side
,
`
Rest

beloved
ashes

till
the
morn
of
*NL*
joy

and
that
he
has
a
service
read
over
it
every
year
-LRB-
which
is
simply
*NL*
sacrilege
-RRB-
,
and
goes
to
Moscow
once
a
year
on
purpose

He
invites
me
to
*NL*
Moscow
in
order
to
prove
his
assertion
,
and
show
me
his
leg
's
tomb
,
and
*NL*
the
very
cannon
that
shot
him
;
he
says
it
's
the
eleventh
from
the
*NL*
gate
of
the

the

laughing

*NL*
``
Excuse

him
the

he
said

the

paused
in
confusion

The
general
gazed
at
his

disdainfully

*NL*
``

said
,

Lebedeff

*NL*
*NL*
``
H
'm
;
I
thought
differently

You
see
,
we
were
talking
over
this
period
*NL*
of
history
.
I
was
criticizing
a
current
report
of
something
which
then
*NL*
happened
,
and
having
been
myself
an
eye-witness
of
the
occurrence

are
looking

*NL*
*NL*

I
am
rather
young-looking

I
know

I
am
actually
older

I
*NL*
appear

I
was
ten
or
eleven
in
the
year
1812
.
I
do
n't
know
my
age
*NL*
exactly
,

it
has
always
been
a
weakness

mine

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
assure
you

I
do
not
in

your
statement

One
*NL*
of
our
living
autobiographers
states
that
when
he
was
a
small
baby
in
*NL*
Moscow
in
1812
the
French
soldiers
fed
him
with
bread
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

there
you
see
!

said
the
general

condescendingly
.
``
There
is
*NL*
nothing
whatever
unusual
about
my
tale

Truth
very
often
appears
to
*NL*
be
impossible

I
was
a
page
--
it
sounds
strange
,
I
dare
say
.
Had
I
been
*NL*
fifteen
years
old
I
should
probably
have
been
terribly
frightened
*NL*
when
the
French
arrived
,
as
my
mother
was
-LRB-
who
had
been
too
slow
about
*NL*
clearing
out
of
Moscow
-RRB-
;
but
as
I
was
only
just
ten
I
was
not
in
the
*NL*
least
alarmed
,
and
rushed
through
the
crowd
to
the
very
door
of
the
*NL*
palace
when
Napoleon
alighted
from
his
horse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Undoubtedly
,
at
ten
years
old
you
would
not
have
felt
the
sense
of
*NL*
fear
,
as
you
say

''
blurted
out
the
prince
,
horribly
uncomfortable
in
the
*NL*
sensation
that
he
was
just
about
to
blush
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
;
and
it
all
happened
so
easily
and
naturally
.
And
yet
,
were
*NL*
a
novelist
to
describe
the
episode
,
he
would
put
in
all
kinds
of
*NL*
impossible
and
incredible
details

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
cried
the
prince
,
``
I
have
often
thought
that
!
Why
,
I
know
of
a
*NL*
murder
,
for
the
sake
of
a
watch
.
It
's
in
all
the
papers
now

But
if
*NL*
some
writer
had
invented
it
,
all
the
critics
would
have
jumped
down
his
*NL*
throat
and
said
the
thing
was
too
improbable
for
anything
.
And
yet
you
*NL*
read
it
in
the
paper
,
and
you
ca
n't
help
thinking
that
out
of
these
*NL*
strange
disclosures
is
to
be
gained
the
full
knowledge
of
Russian
life
*NL*
and
character
.
You
said
that
well
,
general
;
it
is
so
true
,
''
concluded
*NL*
the
prince
,
warmly
,
delighted
to
have
found
a
refuge
from
the
fiery
*NL*
blushes
which
had
covered
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
's
quite
true
,
is
n't
it

''
cried
the
general
,
his
eyes
sparkling
*NL*
with
gratification
.
``
A
small
boy
,
a
child
,
would
naturally
realize
no
*NL*
danger
;
he
would
shove
his
way
through
the
crowds
to
see
the
shine
and
*NL*
glitter
of
the
uniforms
,
and
especially
the
great
man
of
whom
everyone
*NL*
was
speaking
,
for
at
that
time
all
the
world
had
been
talking
of
no
one
*NL*
but
this
man
for
some
years
past
.
The
world
was
full
of
his
name
;
I
--
so
*NL*
to
speak
--
drew
it
in
with
my
mother
's
milk
.
Napoleon
,
passing
a
couple
*NL*
of
paces
from
me
,
caught
sight
of
me
accidentally
.
I
was
very
well
*NL*
dressed
,
and
being
all
alone
,
in
that
crowd
,
as
you
will
easily
*NL*
imagine
...
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
of
course
!
Naturally
the
sight
impressed
him
,
and
proved
to
him
*NL*
that
not
_
all
_
the
aristocracy
had
left
Moscow
;
that
at
least
some
nobles
*NL*
and
their
children
had
remained
behind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
so
!
just
so
!
He
wanted
to
win
over
the
aristocracy
!
When
his
eagle
*NL*
eye
fell
on
me
,
mine
probably
flashed
back
in
response
.
'
_
Voila
un
garcon
*NL*
bien
eveille
!
Qui
est
ton
pere
?
_
'
I
immediately
replied
,
almost
panting
*NL*
with
excitement
,
'
A
general
,
who
died
on
the
battle-fields
of
his
country
!

*NL*

M'aimes

*NL*
*NL*
``
To
this
keen
question
I
replied
as
keenly
,
`
The
Russian
heart
can
*NL*
recognize
a
great
man
even
in
the
bitter
enemy
of
his
country

'
At
*NL*
least
,
I
do
n't
remember
the
exact
words
,
you
know
,
but
the
idea
was
*NL*
as
I
say
.
Napoleon
was
struck
;
he
thought
a
minute
and
then
said
to
*NL*
his
suite
:
'
I
like
that
boy
's
pride
;
if
all
Russians
think
like
this
*NL*
child
,
then
--
'
he
did
n't
finish
,
but
went
on
and
entered
the
palace
.
*NL*
I
instantly
mixed
with
his
suite
,
and
followed
him
.
I
was
already
in
*NL*
high
favour
.
I
remember
when
he
came
into
the
first
hall
,
the
emperor
*NL*
stopped
before
a
portrait
of
the
Empress
Katherine
,
and
after
a
*NL*
thoughtful
glance
remarked
,
`
That
was
a
great
woman
,
'
and
passed
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
in
a
couple
of
days
I
was
known
all
over
the
palace
and
the
*NL*
Kremlin
as
`
le
petit
boyard
.
'
I
only
went
home
to
sleep
.
They
were
*NL*
nearly
out
of
their
minds
about
me
at
home
.
A
couple
of
days
after
this
,
*NL*
Napoleon
's
page
,
De
Bazancour
,
died
;
he
had
not
been
able
to
stand
the
*NL*
trials
of
the
campaign
.
Napoleon
remembered
me
;
I
was
taken
away
without
*NL*
explanation
;
the
dead
page
's
uniform
was
tried
on
me
,
and
when
I
was
*NL*
taken
before
the
emperor
,
dressed
in
it
,
he
nodded
his
head
to
me
,
and
I
*NL*
was
told
that
I
was
appointed
to
the
vacant
post
of
page
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
was
glad
enough
,
for
I
had
long
felt
the
greatest
sympathy
for
*NL*
this
man

and
then
the
pretty
uniform
and
all
that
--
only
a
child
,
you
*NL*
know
--
and
so
on
.
It
was
a
dark
green
dress
coat
with
gold
buttons
--
red
*NL*
facings
,
white
trousers
,
and
a
white
silk
waistcoat

silk
stockings
,
*NL*
shoes
with
buckles
,
and
top-boots
if
I
were
riding
out
with
his
majesty
*NL*
or
with
the
suite

*NL*
*NL*
``
Though
the
position
of
all
of
us
at
that
time
was
not
particularly
*NL*
brilliant
,
and
the
poverty
was
dreadful
all
round
,
yet
the
etiquette
at
*NL*
court
was
strictly
preserved
,
and
the
more
strictly
in
proportion
to
the
*NL*
growth
of
the
forebodings
of
disaster

*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
so

so

murmured
the
poor
prince

who
did
n't
*NL*
know
where
to
look
.
``
Your
memoirs
would
be
most
interesting

*NL*
*NL*
The
general
was
,
of
course
,
repeating
what
he
had
told
Lebedeff
the
*NL*
night
before
,
and
thus
brought
it
out
glibly
enough
,
but
here
he
looked
*NL*
suspiciously
at
the
prince
out
of
the
corners
of
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
memoirs

he
began
,
with
redoubled
pride
and
dignity
.
``
Write
my
*NL*
memoirs

The
idea
has
not
tempted
me

And

if
you

*NL*
have
long
been
written

but
they
shall
not
see
the
light
until
dust

returns
to
dust

Then
,
I
doubt
not

they
will
be
translated
into
all

languages

not
of
course
on
account
of
their
actual
literary
merit

because
of
the
great
events

which
I
was
the
actual
witness

a
child
at
the
time

As
a
child
,
I
was
able
to
penetrate
into
the
*NL*
secrecy
of
the
great
man
's
private
room
.
At
nights
I
have
heard
the
*NL*
groans

wailings

this

in
distress

He
could
feel
no
shame
*NL*
in
weeping
before
such
a
mere
child

I
was
,
though
I
understood
even
*NL*
then
that
the
reason
for
his
suffering
was
the
silence
of
the
Emperor
*NL*
Alexander

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

had
written
letters

all

every
day

He
was
dreadfully
agitated

Sometimes
at

night
I

throw
myself

I
expressed
my

pull
up
,
remembering
whom
he
was
speaking
to
,

his
eyes

would
sparkle
for
a
long
while
after
this

describe

seen
greater

in
ecstasies

for
the

remarks

made

as
they
*NL*
evidently
were

in
all
seriousness

simplicity

quite
dissipated
the

last
relics
of
his
suspicion

*NL*
``
I
know
Charasse

book

Oh
!
I
was
so
angry
with
his
work

wrote
to

him

said

I
forget
what

at
this
moment

You
ask
whether
I
was
very

busy

the
Emperor

Oh
no

I
was
called

hardly
took
my

duty
seriously

Napoleon
very
soon
lost
hope

he
would
have
forgotten
all
about

do

drawn

were
light

be
at

the

occasionally
to
escort
the

out
riding

Davoust
--
nearly
always
with
him
--
a
big
man
with
spectacles
.
They
*NL*
used
to
argue
and
quarrel
sometimes
.
Once
they
were
in
the
Emperor
's
*NL*
study
together
--
just
those
two
and
myself
--
I
was
unobserved
--
and
*NL*
they
argued
,
and
the
Emperor
seemed
to
be
agreeing
to
something
under
*NL*
protest
.
Suddenly
his
eye
fell
on
me
and
an
idea
seemed
to
flash
across
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Child
,
'
he
said
,
abruptly
.
`
If
I
were
to
recognize
the
Russian
*NL*
orthodox
religion
and
emancipate
the
serfs
,
do
you
think
Russia
would
*NL*
come
over
to
me
?
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Never
!
'
I
cried
,
indignantly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Emperor
was
much
struck
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
In
the
flashing
eyes
of
this
patriotic
child
I
read
and
accept
the
*NL*
fiat
of
the
Russian
people
.
Enough
,
Davoust
,
it
is
mere
phantasy
on
our
*NL*
part
.
Come
,
let
's
hear
your
other
project
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Yes
,
but
that
was
a
great
idea
,
''
said
the
prince
,
clearly
interested
.
*NL*
``
You
ascribe
it
to
Davoust
,
do
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
at
all
events
,
they
were
consulting
together
at
the
time
.
Of
*NL*
course
it
was
the
idea
of
an
eagle
,
and
must
have
originated
with
*NL*
Napoleon
;
but
the
other
project
was
good
too
--
it
was
the
`
Conseil
du
*NL*
lion
!
'
as
Napoleon
called
it
.
This
project
consisted
in
a
proposal
*NL*
to
occupy
the
Kremlin
with
the
whole
army
;
to
arm
and
fortify
it
*NL*
scientifically
,
to
kill
as
many
horses
as
could
be
got
,
and
salt
their
*NL*
flesh
,
and
spend
the
winter
there
;
and
in
spring
to
fight
their
way
out
.
*NL*
Napoleon
liked
the
idea
--
it
attracted
him
.
We
rode
round
the
Kremlin
*NL*
walls
every
day
,
and
Napoleon
used
to
give
orders
where
they
were
to
be
*NL*
patched
,
where
built
up
,
where
pulled
down
and
so
on
.
All
was
decided
at
*NL*
last
.
They
were
alone
together
--
those
two
and
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Napoleon
was
walking
up
and
down
with
folded
arms
.
I
could
not
take
my
*NL*
eyes
off
his
face
--
my
heart
beat
loudly
and
painfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
I
'm
off
,
'
said
Davoust
.
`
Where
to
?
'
asked
Napoleon
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
To
salt
horse-flesh
,
'
said
Davoust
.
Napoleon
shuddered
--
his
fate
was
*NL*
being
decided
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Child
,
'
he
addressed
me
suddenly
,
`
what
do
you
think
of
our
plan
?
'
Of
*NL*
course
he
only
applied
to
me
as
a
sort
of
toss-up
,
you
know
.
I
turned
to
*NL*
Davoust
and
addressed
my
reply
to
him
.
I
said
,
as
though
inspired
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Escape
,
general
!
Go
home
!
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
project
was
abandoned
;
Davoust
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
went
out
,
*NL*
whispering
to
himself
--
'
_
Bah
,
il
devient
superstitieux
!
_
'
Next
morning
the
*NL*
order
to
retreat
was
given
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
this
is
most
interesting
,
''
said
the
prince
,
very
softly
,
``
if
it
*NL*
really
was
so
--
that
is
,
I
mean
--
''
he
hastened
to
correct
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
dear
prince
,
''
cried
the
general
,
who
was
now
so
intoxicated
with
*NL*
his
own
narrative
that
he
probably
could
not
have
pulled
up
at
the
*NL*
most
patent
indiscretion
.
``
You
say
,
if
it
really
was
so
!
'
There
was
*NL*
more
--
_
much
_
more
,
I
assure
you
!
These
are
merely
a
few
little
political
*NL*
acts
.
I
tell
you
I
was
the
eye-witness
of
the
nightly
sorrow
and
*NL*
groanings
of
the
great
man
,
and
of
_
that
_
no
one
can
speak
but
myself
.
*NL*
Towards
the
end
he
wept
no
more
,
though
he
continued
to
emit
an
*NL*
occasional
groan
;
but
his
face
grew
more
overcast
day
by
day
,
as
*NL*
though
Eternity
were
wrapping
its
gloomy
mantle
about
him
.
Occasionally
*NL*
we
passed
whole
hours
of
silence
together
at
night
,
Roustan
snoring
*NL*
in
the
next
room
--
that
fellow
slept
like
a
pig
.
`
But
he
's
loyal
to
me
*NL*
and
my
dynasty
,
'
said
Napoleon
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sometimes
it
was
very
painful
to
me
,
and
once
he
caught
me
with
tears
*NL*
in
my
eyes
.
He
looked
at
me
kindly
.
`
You
are
sorry
for
me
,
'
he
said
,
*NL*
`
you
,
my
child
,
and
perhaps
one
other
child
--
my
son
,
the
King
of
*NL*
Rome
--
may
grieve
for
me
.
All
the
rest
hate
me
;
and
my
brothers
are
the
*NL*
first
to
betray
me
in
misfortune
.
'
I
sobbed
and
threw
myself
into
his
*NL*
arms
.
He
could
not
resist
me
--
he
burst
into
tears
,
and
our
tears
mingled
*NL*
as
we
folded
each
other
in
a
close
embrace
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Write
,
oh
,
write
a
letter
to
the
Empress
Josephine
!
'
I
cried
,
sobbing
.
*NL*
Napoleon
started
,
reflected
,
and
said
,
`
You
remind
me
of
a
third
heart
*NL*
which
loves
me
.
Thank
you
,
my
friend
;
'
and
then
and
there
he
sat
down
*NL*
and
wrote
that
letter
to
Josephine
,
with
which
Constant
was
sent
off
*NL*
next
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
a
good
action
,
''
said
the
prince
,
``
for
in
the
midst
of
his
angry
*NL*
feelings
you
insinuated
a
kind
thought
into
his
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
so
,
prince
,
just
so
.
How
well
you
bring
out
that
fact
!
Because
*NL*
your
own
heart
is
good
!
''
cried
the
ecstatic
old
gentleman
,
and
,
*NL*
strangely
enough
,
real
tears
glistened
in
his
eyes
.
``
Yes
,
prince
,
it
was
*NL*
a
wonderful
spectacle

And
,
do
you
know
,
I
all
but
went
off
to
Paris
,
*NL*
and
should
assuredly
have
shared
his
solitary
exile
with
him
;
but
,
alas
,
*NL*
our
destinies
were
otherwise
ordered
!
We
parted
,
he
to
his
island
,
*NL*
where
I
am
sure
he
thought
of
the
weeping
child
who
had
embraced
him
*NL*
so
affectionately
at
parting
in
Moscow
;
and
I
was
sent
off
to
the
cadet
*NL*
corps
,
where
I
found
nothing
but
roughness
and
harsh
discipline
.
Alas
,
*NL*
my
happy
days
were
done
!

*NL*
*NL*
''
'
I
do
not
wish
to
deprive
your
mother
of
you
,
and
,
therefore
,
I
will
*NL*
not
ask
you
to
go
with
me

he
said
,
the
morning
of
his
departure
,
`
but
*NL*
I
should
like
to
do
something
for
you
.
'
He
was
mounting
his
horse
as
*NL*
he
spoke
.
`
Write
something
in
my
sister
's
album
for
me
,
'
I
said
rather
*NL*
timidly
,
for
he
was
in
a
state
of
great
dejection
at
the
moment
.
He
*NL*
turned
,
called
for
a
pen
,
took
the
album
.
`
How
old
is
your
sister
?
'
*NL*
he
asked
,
holding
the
pen
in
his
hand
.
`
Three
years
old
,
'
I
said
.
`
Ah
,
*NL*
_
petite
fille
alors
!
_
'
and
he
wrote
in
the
album
:
*NL*

This

*NL*
The
general
rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

not
in

least

''
said
the
prince
.
``
On
the
contrary

interested

really
very
much
obliged

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Prince
,
''
,
said
the
general
,
pressing
his
hand
,
and
looking
at
him
with
*NL*
flashing
eyes
,
and
an
expression
as
though
he
were
under
the
influence
*NL*
of
a
sudden
thought
which
had
come
upon
him
with
stunning
force
.
*NL*
``
Prince
,
you
are
so
kind
,
so
simple-minded
,
that
sometimes
I
really
*NL*
feel
sorry
for
you
!
I
gaze
at
you
with
a
feeling
of
real
affection
.
Oh
,
*NL*
Heaven
bless
you
!
May
your
life
blossom
and
fructify
in
love
.
Mine
is
*NL*
over
.
Forgive
me
,
forgive
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
left
the
room
quickly
,
covering
his
face
with
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
could
not
doubt
the
sincerity
of
his
agitation
.
He
*NL*
understood
,
too
,
that
the
old
man
had
left
the
room
intoxicated
with
his
*NL*
own
success
.
The
general
belonged
to
that
class
of
liars
,
who
,
in
spite
*NL*
of
their
transports
of
lying
,
invariably
suspect
that
they
are
not
*NL*
believed
.
On
this
occasion
,
when
he
recovered
from
his
exaltation
,
he
*NL*
would
probably
suspect
Muishkin
of
pitying
him
,
and
feel
insulted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
I
been
acting
rightly
in
allowing
him
to
develop
such
vast
*NL*
resources
of
imagination
?
''
the
prince
asked
himself
.
But
his
answer
was
*NL*
a
fit
of
violent
laughter
which
lasted
ten
whole
minutes
.
He
tried
to
*NL*
reproach
himself
for
the
laughing
fit
,
but
eventually
concluded
that
he
*NL*
need
n't
do
so
,
since
in
spite
of
it
he
was
truly
sorry
for
the
old
man
.
*NL*
The
same
evening
he
received
a
strange
letter
,
short
but
decided
.
The
*NL*
general
informed
him
that
they
must
part
for
ever
;
that
he
was
grateful
,
*NL*
but
that
even
from
him
he
could
not
accept
``
signs
of
sympathy
which
were
*NL*
humiliating
to
the
dignity
of
a
man
already
miserable
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
prince
heard
that
the
old
man
had
gone
to
Nina
Alexandrovna
,
*NL*
though
,
he
felt
almost
easy
on
his
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
seen
,
however
,
that
the
general
paid
a
visit
to
Lizabetha
*NL*
Prokofievna
and
caused
trouble
there
,
the
final
upshot
being
that
he
*NL*
frightened
Mrs.
Epanchin
,
and
angered
her
by
bitter
hints
as
to
his
son
*NL*
Gania
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
been
turned
out
in
disgrace
,
eventually
,
and
this
was
the
*NL*
cause
of
his
bad
night
and
quarrelsome
day
,
which
ended
in
his
sudden
*NL*
departure
into
the
street
in
a
condition
approaching
insanity
,
as
*NL*
recorded
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Colia
did
not
understand
the
position
.
He
tried
severity
with
his
*NL*
father
,
as
they
stood
in
the
street
after
the
latter
had
cursed
the
*NL*
household
,
hoping
to
bring
him
round
that
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
where
are
we
to
go
to
now
,
father
?
''
he
asked
.
``
You
do
n't

*NL*
``
Better

stopping

in
a
frenzy

I

fought
a
duel
for
him

He
was
married
afterwards

then
killed
on

The
bullet
struck

off

The
general
was
dragging
him
away
towards
the
door
a
*NL*
house
near
.
He
sat
down
on
the
step
,
still
holding
Colia
by
the
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bend

said
poor

stooping
down

towards
the
old
man
,
all
the
same
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

whispered
the

trembling
all
over

the

continued
to

clinging
more
and
more
*NL*
tightly
to
the
boy
's
shoulder
.

''
*NL*
*NL*
Colia
broke
loose
,
seized
his
father
by
the
shoulders
,
and
stared
into
*NL*
his
eyes
with
frenzied
gaze
.
The
old
man
had
grown
livid
--
his
lips
were
*NL*
shaking
,
convulsions
were
passing
over
his
features
.
Suddenly
he
leant
*NL*
over
and
began
to
sink
slowly
into
Colia
's
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
got
a
stroke
!
''
cried
Colia
,
loudly
,
realizing
what
was
the
matter
*NL*
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
V
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
point
of
fact
,
Varia
had
rather
exaggerated
the
certainty
of
her
*NL*
news
as
to
the
prince
's
betrothal
to
Aglaya
.
Very
likely
,
with
the
*NL*
perspicacity
of
her
sex
,
she
gave
out
as
an
accomplished
fact
what
she
*NL*
felt
was
pretty
sure
to
become
a
fact
in
a
few
days
.
Perhaps
she
could
*NL*
not
resist
the
satisfaction
of
pouring
one
last
drop
of
bitterness
into
*NL*
her
brother
Gania
's
cup
,
in
spite
of
her
love
for
him
.
At
all
events
,
*NL*
she
had
been
unable
to
obtain
any
definite
news
from
the
Epanchin
*NL*
girls
--
the
most
she
could
get
out
of
them
being
hints
and
surmises
,
and
*NL*
so
on
.
Perhaps
Aglaya
's
sisters
had
merely
been
pumping
Varia
for
news
*NL*
while
pretending
to
impart
information
;
or
perhaps
,
again
,
they
had
been
*NL*
unable
to
resist
the
feminine
gratification
of
teasing
a
friend
--
for
,
*NL*
after
all
this
time
,
they
could
scarcely
have
helped
divining
the
aim
of
*NL*
her
frequent
visits
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
other
hand
,
the
prince
,
although
he
had
told
Lebedeff
,
--
as
we
*NL*
know
,
that
nothing
had
happened
,
and
that
he
had
nothing
to
impart
,
--
the
*NL*
prince
may
have
been
in
error
.
Something
strange
seemed
to
have
*NL*
happened
,
without
anything
definite
having
actually
happened
.
Varia
had
*NL*
guessed
that
with
her
true
feminine
instinct
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
or
why
it
came
about
that
everyone
at
the
Epanchins
'
became
imbued
*NL*
with
one
conviction
--
that
something
very
important
had
happened
to
*NL*
Aglaya
,
and
that
her
fate
was
in
process
of
settlement
--
it
would
be
very
*NL*
difficult
to
explain
.
But
no
sooner
had
this
idea
taken
root
,
than
all
*NL*
at
once
declared
that
they
had
seen
and
observed
it
long
ago
;
that
they
*NL*
had
remarked
it
at
the
time
of
the
``
poor
knight
''
joke
,
and
even
before
,
*NL*
though
they
had
been
unwilling
to
believe
in
such
nonsense
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
said
the
sisters
.
Of
course
,
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
had
foreseen
it
*NL*
long
before
the
rest
;
her
``
heart
had
been
sore
''
for
a
long
while
,
*NL*
she
declared
,
and
it
was
now
so
sore
that
she
appeared
to
be
quite
*NL*
overwhelmed
,
and
the
very
thought
of
the
prince
became
distasteful
to
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
question
to
be
decided
--
most
important
,
but
most
difficult
;
*NL*
so
much
so
,
that
Mrs.
Epanchin
did
not
even
see
how
to
put
it
into
*NL*
words
.
Would
the
prince
do
or
not
?
Was
all
this
good
or
bad
?
If
good
*NL*
-LRB-
which
might
be
the
case
,
of
course
-RRB-
,
_
why
_
good
?
If
bad
-LRB-
which
was
*NL*
hardly
doubtful
-RRB-
,
_
wherein
_
,
especially
,
bad
?
Even
the
general
,
the
*NL*
paterfamilias
,
though
astonished
at
first
,
suddenly
declared
that
,
``
upon
*NL*
his
honour
,
he
really
believed
he
had
fancied
something
of
the
kind
,
*NL*
after
all
.
At
first
,
it
seemed
a
new
idea
,
and
then
,
somehow
,
it
looked
*NL*
as
familiar
as
possible
.
''
His
wife
frowned
him
down
there
.
This
was
*NL*
in
the
morning
;
but
in
the
evening
,
alone
with
his
wife
,
he
had
given
*NL*
tongue
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
really
,
you
know
''
--
-LRB-
silence
-RRB-
--
``
of
course
,
you
know
all
this
is
*NL*
very
strange
,
if
true
,
which
I
can
not
deny
;
but
''
--
-LRB-
silence
-RRB-
.
--
``
But
,
*NL*
on
the
other
hand
,
if
one
looks
things
in
the
face
,
you
know
--
upon
my
*NL*
honour
,
the
prince
is
a
rare
good
fellow
--
and
--
and
--
and
--
well
,
his
name
,
*NL*
you
know
--
your
family
name

all
this
looks
well
,
and
perpetuates
the
*NL*
name
and
title
and
all
that
--
which
at
this
moment
is
not
standing
so
*NL*
high
as
it
might
--
from
one
point
of
view
--
do
n't
you
know

The

know

it
is
not
very
large

--
he
--
''
-LRB-
Continued
silence
,
and
collapse
of
the
general
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
Hearing
these
words
from
her
husband
,
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
was
driven
*NL*
beside
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
According
to
her
opinion
,
the
whole
thing
had
been
one
huge
,
*NL*
fantastical
,
absurd
,
unpardonable
mistake
.
``
First
of
all
,
this
prince
is
*NL*
an
idiot
,
and
,
secondly
,
he
is
a
fool
--
knows
nothing
of
the
world
,
and
*NL*
has
no
place
in
it
.
Whom
can
he
be
shown
to
?
Where
can
you
take
him
to
?
*NL*
What
will
old
Bielokonski
say
?
We
never
thought
of
such
a
husband
as
*NL*
_
that
_
for
our
Aglaya
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
,
the
last
argument
was
the
chief
one
.
The
maternal
heart
*NL*
trembled
with
indignation
to
think
of
such
an
absurdity
,
although
in
*NL*
that
heart
there
rose
another
voice
,
which
said
:
``
And
_
why
_
is
not
the
*NL*
prince
such
a
husband
as
you
would
have
desired
for
Aglaya
?
''
It
was
this
*NL*
voice
which
annoyed
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
more
than
anything
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
some
reason
or
other
,
the
sisters
liked
the
idea
of
the
prince
.
They
*NL*
did
not
even
consider
it
very
strange
;
in
a
word
,
they
might
be
expected
*NL*
at
any
moment
to
range
themselves
strongly
on
his
side
.
But
both
of
them
*NL*
decided
to
say
nothing
either
way
.
It
had
always
been
noticed
in
the
*NL*
family
that
the
stronger
Mrs.
Epanchin
's
opposition
was
to
any
project
,
*NL*
the
nearer
she
was
,
in
reality
,
to
giving
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexandra
,
however
,
found
it
difficult
to
keep
absolute
silence
on
*NL*
the
subject
.
Long
since
holding
,
as
she
did
,
the
post
of
``
confidential
*NL*
adviser
to
mamma
,
''
she
was
now
perpetually
called
in
council
,
and
asked
*NL*
her
opinion
,
and
especially
her
assistance
,
in
order
to
recollect
``
how
*NL*
on
earth
all
this
happened
?
''
Why
did
no
one
see
it
?
Why
did
no
one
say
*NL*
anything
about
it
?
What
did
all
that
wretched
``
poor
knight
''
joke
mean
?
*NL*
Why
was
she
,
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
,
driven
to
think
,
and
foresee
,
and
*NL*
worry
for
everybody
,
while
they
all
sucked
their
thumbs
,
and
counted
the
*NL*
crows
in
the
garden
,
and
did
nothing
?
At
first
,
Alexandra
had
been
very
*NL*
careful
,
and
had
merely
replied
that
perhaps
her
father
's
remark
was
not
*NL*
so
far
out
:
that
,
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
,
probably
the
choice
of
the
*NL*
prince
as
a
husband
for
one
of
the
Epanchin
girls
would
be
considered
a
*NL*
very
wise
one
.
Warming
up
,
however
,
she
added
that
the
prince
was
by
no
*NL*
means
a
fool
,
and
never
had
been
;
and
that
as
to
``
place
in
the
world
,
''
*NL*
no
one
knew
what
the
position
of
a
respectable
person
in
Russia
would
*NL*
imply
in
a
few
years
--
whether
it
would
depend
on
successes
in
the
*NL*
government
service
,
on
the
old
system
,
or
what
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
all
this
her
mother
replied
that
Alexandra
was
a
freethinker
,
and
*NL*
that
all
this
was
due
to
that
``
cursed
woman
's
rights
question
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Half
an
hour
after
this
conversation
,
she
went
off
to
town
,
and
thence
*NL*
to
the
Kammenny
Ostrof
,
-LSB-
``
Stone
Island
,
''
a
suburb
and
park
of
St.
*NL*
Petersburg
-RSB-
to
see
Princess
Bielokonski
,
who
had
just
arrived
from
*NL*
Moscow
on
a
short
visit
.
The
princess
was
Aglaya
's
godmother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Old
Bielokonski
''
listened
to
all
the
fevered
and
despairing
lamentations
*NL*
of
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
without
the
least
emotion
;
the
tears
of
this
*NL*
sorrowful
mother
did
not
evoke
answering
sighs
--
in
fact
,
she
laughed
at
*NL*
her
.
She
was
a
dreadful
old
despot
,
this
princess
;
she
could
not
allow
*NL*
equality
in
anything
,
not
even
in
friendship
of
the
oldest
standing
,
and
*NL*
she
insisted
on
treating
Mrs.
Epanchin
as
her
_
protegee
_
,
as
she
had
been
*NL*
thirty-five
years
ago
.
She
could
never
put
up
with
the
independence
and
*NL*
energy
of
Lizabetha
's
character
.
She
observed
that
,
as
usual
,
the
whole
*NL*
family
had
gone
much
too
far
ahead
,
and
had
converted
a
fly
into
an
*NL*
elephant
;
that
,
so
far
as
she
had
heard
their
story
,
she
was
persuaded
*NL*
that
nothing
of
any
seriousness
had
occurred
;
that
it
would
surely
*NL*
be
better
to
wait
until
something
_
did
_
happen
;
that
the
prince
,
in
*NL*
her
opinion
,
was
a
very
decent
young
fellow
,
though
perhaps
a
little
*NL*
eccentric
,
through
illness
,
and
not
quite
as
weighty
in
the
world
as
one
*NL*
could
wish
.
The
worst
feature
was
,
she
said
,
Nastasia
Philipovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
well
understood
that
the
old
lady
was
angry
at
the
*NL*
failure
of
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
--
her
own
recommendation
.
She
returned
*NL*
home
to
Pavlofsk
in
a
worse
humour
than
when
she
left
,
and
of
course
*NL*
everybody
in
the
house
suffered
.
She
pitched
into
everyone
,
because
,
she
*NL*
declared
,
they
had
`
gone
mad
.
'
Why
were
things
always
mismanaged
in
her
*NL*
house
?
Why
had
everybody
been
in
such
a
frantic
hurry
in
this
matter
?
*NL*
So
far
as
she
could
see
,
nothing
whatever
had
happened
.
Surely
they
had
*NL*
better
wait
and
see
what
was
to
happen
,
instead
of
making
mountains
out
*NL*
of
molehills
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
the
conclusion
of
the
matter
was
that
it
would
be
far
better
to
*NL*
take
it
quietly
,
and
wait
coolly
to
see
what
would
turn
up
.
But
,
alas
!
*NL*
peace
did
not
reign
for
more
than
ten
minutes
.
The
first
blow
dealt
to
*NL*
its
power
was
in
certain
news
communicated
to
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
as
*NL*
to
events
which
had
happened
during
her
trip
to
see
the
princess
.
-LRB-
This
*NL*
trip
had
taken
place
the
day
after
that
on
which
the
prince
had
turned
*NL*
up
at
the
Epanchins
at
nearly
one
o'clock
at
night
,
thinking
it
was
*NL*
nine
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
The
sisters
replied
candidly
and
fully
enough
to
their
mother
's
*NL*
impatient
questions
on
her
return
.
They
said
,
in
the
first
place
,
that
*NL*
nothing
particular
had
happened
since
her
departure
;
that
the
prince
*NL*
had
been
,
and
that
Aglaya
had
kept
him
waiting
a
long
while
before
*NL*
she
appeared
--
half
an
hour
,
at
least
;
that
she
had
then
come
in
,
and
*NL*
immediately
asked
the
prince
to
have
a
game
of
chess
;
that
the
prince
*NL*
did
not
know
the
game
,
and
Aglaya
had
beaten
him
easily
;
that
she
had
*NL*
been
in
a
wonderfully
merry
mood
,
and
had
laughed
at
the
prince
,
and
*NL*
chaffed
him
so
unmercifully
that
one
was
quite
sorry
to
see
his
wretched
*NL*
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
then
asked
him
to
play
cards
--
the
game
called
``
little
fools
.
''
*NL*
At
this
game
the
tables
were
turned
completely
,
for
the
prince
had
shown
*NL*
himself
a
master
at
it
.
Aglaya
had
cheated
and
changed
cards
,
and
stolen
*NL*
others
,
in
the
most
bare-faced
way
,
but
,
in
spite
of
everything
the
*NL*
prince
had
beaten
her
hopelessly
five
times
running
,
and
she
had
been
*NL*
left
``
little
fool
''
each
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aglaya
then
lost
her
temper
,
and
began
to
say
such
awful
things
to
the
*NL*
prince
that
he
laughed
no
more
,
but
grew
dreadfully
pale
,
especially
*NL*
when
she
said
that
she
should
not
remain
in
the
house
with
him
,
and
that
*NL*
he
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
coming
to
their
house
at
all
,
especially
at
*NL*
night
,
''
_
after
all
that
had
happened
.
_
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
she
had
left
the
room
,
banging
the
door
after
her
,
and
the
*NL*
prince
went
off
,
looking
as
though
he
were
on
his
way
to
a
funeral
,
in
*NL*
spite
of
all
their
attempts
at
consolation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
,
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
the
prince
's
departure
,
Aglaya
had
*NL*
rushed
out
of
her
room
in
such
a
hurry
that
she
had
not
even
wiped
her
*NL*
eyes
,
which
were
full
of
tears
.
She
came
back
because
Colia
had
brought
*NL*
a
hedgehog
.
Everybody
came
in
to
see
the
hedgehog
.
In
answer
to
their
*NL*
questions
Colia
explained
that
the
hedgehog
was
not
his
,
and
that
he
had
*NL*
left
another
boy
,
Kostia
Lebedeff
,
waiting
for
him
outside
.
Kostia
was
*NL*
too
shy
to
come
in
,
because
he
was
carrying
a
hatchet
;
they
had
bought
*NL*
the
hedgehog
and
the
hatchet
from
a
peasant
whom
they
had
met
on
the
*NL*
road
.
He
had
offered
to
sell
them
the
hedgehog
,
and
they
had
paid
fifty
*NL*
copecks
for
it
;
and
the
hatchet
had
so
taken
their
fancy
that
they
had
*NL*
made
up
their
minds
to
buy
it
of
their
own
accord
.
On
hearing
this
,
*NL*
Aglaya
urged
Colia
to
sell
her
the
hedgehog
;
she
even
called
him
``
dear
*NL*
Colia
,
''
in
trying
to
coax
him
.
He
refused
for
a
long
time
,
but
at
last
*NL*
he
could
hold
out
no
more
,
and
went
to
fetch
Kostia
Lebedeff
.
The
latter
*NL*
appeared
,
carrying
his
hatchet
,
and
covered
with
confusion
.
Then
it
came
*NL*
out
that
the
hedgehog
was
not
theirs
,
but
the
property
of
a
schoolmate
,
*NL*
one
Petroff
,
who
had
given
them
some
money
to
buy
Schlosser
's
History
*NL*
for
him
,
from
another
schoolfellow
who
at
that
moment
was
driven
to
*NL*
raising
money
by
the
sale
of
his
books
.
Colia
and
Kostia
were
about
to
*NL*
make
this
purchase
for
their
friend
when
chance
brought
the
hedgehog
*NL*
to
their
notice
,
and
they
had
succumbed
to
the
temptation
of
buying
it
.
*NL*
They
were
now
taking
Petroff
the
hedgehog
and
hatchet
which
they
had
*NL*
bought
with
his
money
,
instead
of
Schlosser
's
History
.
But
Aglaya
so
*NL*
entreated
them
that
at
last
they
consented
to
sell
her
the
hedgehog
.
As
*NL*
soon
as
she
had
got
possession
of
it
,
she
put
it
in
a
wicker
basket
with
*NL*
Colia
's
help
,
and
covered
it
with
a
napkin
.
Then
she
said
to
Colia
:
``
Go
*NL*
and
take
this
hedgehog
to
the
prince
from
me
,
and
ask
him
to
accept
it
*NL*
as
a
token
of
my
profound
respect
.
''
Colia
joyfully
promised
to
do
the
*NL*
errand
,
but
he
demanded
explanations
.
``
What
does
the
hedgehog
mean
?
What
*NL*
is
the
meaning
of
such
a
present
?
''
Aglaya
replied
that
it
was
none
of
*NL*
his
business
.
``
I
am
sure
that
there
is
some
allegory
about
it
,
''
Colia
*NL*
persisted
.
Aglaya
grew
angry
,
and
called
him
``
a
silly
boy
.
''
``
If
I
did
*NL*
not
respect
all
women
in
your
person
,
''
replied
Colia
,
``
and
if
my
own
*NL*
principles
would
permit
it
,
I
would
soon
prove
to
you
,
that
I
know
how
*NL*
to
answer
such
an
insult
!
''
But
,
in
the
end
,
Colia
went
off
with
the
*NL*
hedgehog
in
great
delight
,
followed
by
Kostia
Lebedeff
.
Aglaya
's
*NL*
annoyance
was
soon
over
,
and
seeing
that
Colia
was
swinging
the
*NL*
hedgehog
's
basket
violently
to
and
fro
,
she
called
out
to
him
from
the
*NL*
verandah
,
as
if
they
had
never
quarrelled
:
``
Colia
,
dear
,
please
take
*NL*
care
not
to
drop
him
!
''
Colia
appeared
to
have
no
grudge
against
her
,
*NL*
either
,
for
he
stopped
,
and
answered
most
cordially
:
``
No
,
I
will
not
*NL*
drop
him
!
Do
n't
be
afraid
,
Aglaya
Ivanovna
!
''
After
which
he
went
on
his
*NL*
way
.
Aglaya
burst
out
laughing
and
ran
up
to
her
room
,
highly
delighted
.
*NL*
Her
good
spirits
lasted
the
whole
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
filled
poor
Lizabetha
's
mind
with
chaotic
confusion
.
What
on
*NL*
earth
did
it
all
mean
?
The
most
disturbing
feature
was
the
hedgehog
.
*NL*
What
was
the
symbolic
signification
of
a
hedgehog
?
What
did
they
*NL*
understand
by
it
?
What
underlay
it
?
Was
it
a
cryptic
message
?
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
General
Epanchin
``
put
his
foot
in
it
''
by
answering
the
above
*NL*
questions
in
his
own
way
.
He
said
there
was
no
cryptic
message
at
*NL*
all
.
As
for
the
hedgehog
,
it
was
just
a
hedgehog
,
which
meant
*NL*
nothing
--
unless
,
indeed
,
it
was
a
pledge
of
friendship
,
--
the
sign
of
*NL*
forgetting
of
offences
and
so
on
.
At
all
events
,
it
was
a
joke
,
and
,
of
*NL*
course
,
a
most
pardonable
and
innocent
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
may
as
well
remark
that
the
general
had
guessed
perfectly
accurately
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
,
returning
home
from
the
interview
with
Aglaya
,
had
sat
*NL*
gloomy
and
depressed
for
half
an
hour
.
He
was
almost
in
despair
when
*NL*
Colia
arrived
with
the
hedgehog
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
sky
cleared
in
a
moment
.
The
prince
seemed
to
arise
from
the
*NL*
dead
;
he
asked
Colia
all
about
it
,
made
him
repeat
the
story
over
and
*NL*
over
again
,
and
laughed
and
shook
hands
with
the
boys
in
his
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
clear
to
the
prince
that
Aglaya
forgave
him
,
and
that
he
might
*NL*
go
there
again
this
very
evening
;
and
in
his
eyes
that
was
not
only
the
*NL*
main
thing
,
but
everything
in
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
children
we
are
still
,
Colia
!
''
he
cried
at
last
,
*NL*
enthusiastically
,
--
``
and
how
delightful
it
is
that
we
can
be
children
*NL*
still
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Simply
--
my
dear
prince
,
--
simply
she
is
in
love
with
you
,
--
that
's
the
*NL*
whole
of
the
secret
!
''
replied
Colia
,
with
authority
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
blushed
,
but
this
time
he
said
nothing
.
Colia
burst
out
*NL*
laughing
and
clapped
his
hands
.
A
minute
later
the
prince
laughed
too
,
*NL*
and
from
this
moment
until
the
evening
he
looked
at
his
watch
every
*NL*
other
minute
to
see
how
much
time
he
had
to
wait
before
evening
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
situation
was
becoming
rapidly
critical
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Epanchin
could
bear
her
suspense
no
longer
,
and
in
spite
of
the
*NL*
opposition
of
husband
and
daughters
,
she
sent
for
Aglaya
,
determined
to
*NL*
get
a
straightforward
answer
out
of
her
,
once
for
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Otherwise
,
''
she
observed
hysterically
,
``
I
shall
die
before
evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
only
now
that
everyone
realized
to
what
a
ridiculous
dead-lock
*NL*
the
whole
matter
had
been
brought
.
Excepting
feigned
surprise
,
*NL*
indignation
,
laughter
,
and
jeering
--
both
at
the
prince
and
at
everyone
*NL*
who
asked
her
questions
,
--
nothing
could
be
got
out
of
Aglaya
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
went
to
bed
and
only
rose
again
in
time
for
tea
,
*NL*
when
the
prince
might
be
expected
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
awaited
him
in
trembling
agitation
;
and
when
he
at
last
arrived
she
*NL*
nearly
went
off
into
hysterics
.
*NL*
*NL*
Muishkin
himself
came
in
very
timidly
.
He
seemed
to
feel
his
way
,
and
*NL*
looked
in
each
person
's
eyes
in
a
questioning
way
,
--
for
Aglaya
was
*NL*
absent
,
which
fact
alarmed
him
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
evening
there
were
no
strangers
present
--
no
one
but
the
immediate
*NL*
members
of
the
family
.
Prince
S.
was
still
in
town
,
occupied
with
the
*NL*
affairs
of
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
's
uncle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
at
least
_
he
_
would
come
and
say
something
!
''
complained
poor
*NL*
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
general
sat
still
with
a
most
preoccupied
air
.
The
sisters
were
*NL*
looking
very
serious
and
did
not
speak
a
word
,
and
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
*NL*
did
not
know
how
to
commence
the
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
she
plunged
into
an
energetic
and
hostile
criticism
of
*NL*
railways
,
and
glared
at
the
prince
defiantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alas
Aglaya
still
did
not
come
--
and
the
prince
was
quite
lost
.
He
had
*NL*
the
greatest
difficulty
in
expressing
his
opinion
that
railways
were
*NL*
most
useful
institutions
,
--
and
in
the
middle
of
his
speech
Adelaida
*NL*
laughed
,
which
threw
him
into
a
still
worse
state
of
confusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
in
marched
Aglaya
,
as
calm
and
collected
as
could
be
.
*NL*
She
gave
the
prince
a
ceremonious
bow
and
solemnly
took
up
a
*NL*
prominent
position
near
the
big
round
table
.
She
looked
at
the
prince
*NL*
questioningly
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
present
realized
that
the
moment
for
the
settlement
of
perplexities
*NL*
had
arrived
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
get
my
hedgehog
?
''
she
inquired
,
firmly
and
almost
angrily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
got
it
,
''
said
the
prince
,
blushing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
us
now
,
at
once
,
what
you
made
of
the
present
?
I
must
have
you
*NL*
answer
this
question
for
mother
's
sake
;
she
needs
pacifying
,
and
so
do
*NL*
all
the
rest
of
the
family
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
,
Aglaya
--
''
began
the
general
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
--
this
is
going
beyond
all
limits
!
''
said
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
,
*NL*
suddenly
alarmed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
in
the
least
beyond
all
limits
,
mamma
!
''
said
her
daughter
,
*NL*
firmly
.
``
I
sent
the
prince
a
hedgehog
this
morning
,
and
I
wish
to
hear
*NL*
his
opinion
of
it
.
Go
on
,
prince
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
--
what
sort
of
opinion
,
Aglaya
Ivanovna
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
the
hedgehog
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
--
I
suppose
you
wish
to
know
how
I
received
the
hedgehog
,
Aglaya
*NL*
Ivanovna
,
--
or
,
I
should
say
,
how
I
regarded
your
sending
him
to
me
?
In
*NL*
that
case
,
I
may
tell
you
--
in
a
word
--
that
I
--
in
fact
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
,
breathless
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
--
you
have
n't
told
us
much
!
''
said
Aglaya
,
after
waiting
some
five
*NL*
seconds
.
``
Very
well
,
I
am
ready
to
drop
the
hedgehog
,
if
you
like
;
but
*NL*
I
am
anxious
to
be
able
to
clear
up
this
accumulation
of
*NL*
misunderstandings
.
Allow
me
to
ask
you
,
prince
,
--
I
wish
to
hear
from
*NL*
you
,
personally
--
are
you
making
me
an
offer
,
or
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gracious
heavens
!
''
exclaimed
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
.
The
prince
started
.
*NL*
The
general
stiffened
in
his
chair
;
the
sisters
frowned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
deceive
me
now
,
prince
--
tell
the
truth
.
All
these
people
*NL*
persecute
me
with
astounding
questions
--
about
you
.
Is
there
any
ground
*NL*
for
all
these
questions
,
or
not
?
Come
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
asked
you
to
marry
me
yet
,
Aglaya
Ivanovna
,
''
said
the
*NL*
prince
,
becoming
suddenly
animated
;
``
but
you
know
yourself
how
much
I
*NL*
love
you
and
trust
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
I
asked
you
this

answer
this
!
Do
you
intend
to
ask
for
my
hand

or
*NL*
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
I
do
ask
for
it
!
''
said
the
prince
,
more
dead
than
alive
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
general
stir
in
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
no
--
my
dear
girl
,
''
began
the
general
.
``
You
can
not
proceed
like
*NL*
this

Aglaya

that
's
how
the
matter
stands

impossible

Prince

*NL*
forgive
it

my

fellow

Lizabetha
Prokofievna

he
appealed
to
*NL*
his
spouse
for
help

``
you
must
really

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
I

not
I

I
retire
from
all
responsibility

''
said
Lizabetha
*NL*
Prokofievna
,
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Allow
me
to
speak

Aglaya

I

her

in
dismay

*NL*
*NL*

It

disgraceful

Lizabetha

in

loud
whisper

*NL*

mad

*NL*
*NL*
``

Just
so

*NL*

I

the

blushing
violently
.

*NL*
``
Is

Aglaya

candidly

without

However

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
``
A

I

*NL*
*NL*
But
here
the
two
sisters
could
restrain
themselves
no
longer
,
and
both
*NL*
of
them
burst
into
irrepressible
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Adelaida
had
long
since
detected
in
Aglaya
's
features
the
gathering
*NL*
signs
of
an
approaching
storm
of
laughter
,
which
she
restrained
with
*NL*
amazing
self-control
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aglaya
looked
menacingly
at
her
laughing
sisters
,
but
could
not
contain
*NL*
herself
any
longer
,
and
the
next
minute
she
too
had
burst
into
an
*NL*
irrepressible
,
and
almost
hysterical
,
fit
of
mirth
.
At
length
she
jumped
*NL*
up
,
and
ran
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
it
was
all
a

cried
Adelaida
.
``
I
felt
it
ever

the

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

no

I
can
not
allow
this

this
is
a
little

much

cried
*NL*
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
,
exploding
with
rage
,
and
she
rose
from
her
seat
*NL*
and
followed
Aglaya
out
of
the
room
as
quickly
as
she
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
sisters
hurriedly
went
after
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
and
the
general
were
the
only
two
persons
left
in
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It

cried
the
general
.
He
was
evidently
so
much
agitated
*NL*
that
he
hardly
knew
what
he
wished
to
say

``
Seriously

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only

sadly

*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
The
general
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Strange

it

able

give

then

a

on

is

in

on
your

*NL*
on
hers
.

*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
Alexandra
's
voice
was
heard
outside
the
door
,
calling
out
*NL*
``
Papa
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
for
me
here
,
my

will
you

Just
wait
and

it
all
over

*NL*

I
'll
come
back
directly
,
''
he
said
hurriedly
,
and
made
off
with
what
*NL*
looked
like
the
rapidity
of
alarm
in
response
to
Alexandra
's
call
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
found
the
mother
and
daughter
locked
in
one
another
's
arms
,
mingling
*NL*
their
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
were
the
tears
of
joy
and
peace
and
reconciliation
.
Aglaya
was
*NL*
kissing
her
mother
's
lips
and
cheeks
and
hands
;
they
were
hugging
each
*NL*
other
in
the
most
ardent
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
look
at
her
now
--
Ivan
Fedorovitch

Here
she
is

all
of
her

This
*NL*
is
our
_
real
_
Aglaya
at
last
!
''
said
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aglaya
raised
her
happy
,
tearful
face
from
her
mother
's
breast
,
glanced
*NL*
at
her
father
,
and
burst
out
laughing
.
She
sprang
at
him
and
hugged
him
*NL*
too
,
and
kissed
him
over
and
over
again
.
She
then
rushed
back
to
her
*NL*
mother
and
hid
her
face
in
the
maternal
bosom
,
and
there
indulged
in
*NL*
more
tears
.
Her
mother
covered
her
with
a
corner
of
her
shawl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
cruel
little
girl
!
How
will
you
treat
us
all
next
,
I
wonder
?
''
*NL*
she
said
,
but
she
spoke
with
a
ring
of
joy
in
her
voice
,
and
as
though
*NL*
she
breathed
at
last
without
the
oppression
which
she
had
felt
so
long
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cruel
?
''
sobbed
Aglaya
.
``
Yes
,
I
_
am
_
cruel
,
and
worthless
,
and
*NL*
spoiled

tell
father
so
,
--
oh
,
here
he
is
--
I
forgot
Father
,
listen
!
''
She
*NL*
laughed
through
her
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
darling
,
my
little
idol
,
''
cried
the
general
,
kissing
and
fondling
*NL*
her
hands
-LRB-
Aglaya
did
not
draw
them
away
-RRB-
;
``
so
you
love
this
young
man
,
*NL*
do
you
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

no

no

I
ca
n't

young
man

cried
*NL*
Aglaya
,
raising
her
head
.
``
And
if
you
dare
say
that
_
once

more

serious

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
certainly
did
seem
to
be
serious
enough
.
She
had
flushed
up
all
over
*NL*
and
her
eyes
were
blazing
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
general
felt
troubled
and
remained
silent
,
while
Lizabetha
*NL*
Prokofievna
telegraphed
to
him
from
behind
Aglaya
to
ask
no
questions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
that
's
the
case
,
darling

then
,
of
course
,
you
shall
do
exactly
as
*NL*
you
like

He
is
waiting
alone
downstairs
.
Had
n't
I
better
hint
to
him
*NL*
gently
that
he
can
go
?

The
general
telegraphed
to
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
*NL*
in
his
turn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
you
need
n't
do
anything

the
sort

n't
hint
gently

at
all

I
'll
go
down
myself
directly

I
wish
to
apologize
to
this
young
*NL*
man
,
because
I
hurt
his
feelings

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

_
seriously

said
the
general
,
gravely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

you
'd
better
stay
here

all
of
you

for

little

I
'll
go

down
to
him
alone
to
begin
with
.
I
'll
just
go
in
and
then
you
can
follow
*NL*
me
almost
at
once
.
That
's
the
best
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
almost
reached
the
door
when
she
turned
round
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
laugh
--
I
know
I
shall
;
I
shall
die
of
laughing

she
said
,
*NL*
lugubriously
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
she
turned
and
ran
down
to
the
prince
as
fast
as
her
feet
could
*NL*
carry
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
does
it
all
mean
?
What
do
you
make
of
it
?
''
asked
the
general
*NL*
of
his
spouse
,
hurriedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hardly
dare
say
,
''
said
Lizabetha
,
as
hurriedly
,
``
but
I
think
it
's
as
*NL*
plain
as
anything
can
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
so
too
,
as
clear
as
day
;
she
loves
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Loves
him
?
She
is
head
over
ears
in
love
,
that
's
what
she
is
,
''
put
in
*NL*
Alexandra
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
God
bless
her
,
God
bless
her
,
if
such
is
her
destiny
,
''
said
*NL*
Lizabetha
,
crossing
herself
devoutly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
H
'm
destiny
it
is
,
''
said
the
general
,
``
and
there
's
no
getting
out
of
*NL*
destiny
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
words
they
all
moved
off
towards
the
drawing-room
,
where
*NL*
another
surprise
awaited
them
.
Aglaya
had
not
only
not
laughed
,
as
she
*NL*
had
feared
,
but
had
gone
to
the
prince
rather
timidly
,
and
said
to
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forgive
a
silly
,
horrid
,
spoilt
girl
''
--
-LRB-
she
took
his
hand
here
-RRB-
--
``
and
*NL*
be
quite
assured
that
we
all
of
us
esteem
you
beyond
all
words
.
And
if
I
*NL*
dared
to
turn
your
beautiful
,
admirable
simplicity
to
ridicule
,
forgive
*NL*
me
as
you
would
a
little
child
its
mischief
.
Forgive
me
all
my
absurdity
*NL*
of
just
now
,
which
,
of
course
,
meant
nothing
,
and
could
not
have
the
*NL*
slightest
consequence
.
''
She
spoke
these
words
with
great
emphasis
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
father
,
mother
,
and
sisters
came
into
the
room
and
were
much
struck
*NL*
with
the
last
words
,
which
they
just
caught
as
they
entered
--
``
absurdity
*NL*
which
of
course
meant
nothing
''
--
and
still
more
so
with
the
emphasis
with
*NL*
which
Aglaya
had
spoken
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
exchanged
glances
questioningly
,
but
the
prince
did
not
seem
to
*NL*
have
understood
the
meaning
of
Aglaya
's
words
;
he
was
in
the
highest
*NL*
heaven
of
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
speak
so
?
''
he
murmured
.
``
Why
do
you
ask
my
forgiveness
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
wished
to
add
that
he
was
unworthy
of
being
asked
for
forgiveness
*NL*
by
her
,
but
paused
.
Perhaps
he
did
understand
Aglaya
's
sentence
about
*NL*
``
absurdity
which
meant
nothing
,
''
and
like
the
strange
fellow
that
he
*NL*
was
,
rejoiced
in
the
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
Undoubtedly
the
fact
that
he
might
now
come
and
see
Aglaya
as
much
as
*NL*
he
pleased
again
was
quite
enough
to
make
him
perfectly
happy
;
that
he
*NL*
might
come
and
speak
to
her
,
and
see
her
,
and
sit
by
her
,
and
walk
with
*NL*
her
--
who
knows
,
but
that
all
this
was
quite
enough
to
satisfy
him
for
*NL*
the
whole
of
his
life
,
and
that
he
would
desire
no
more
to
the
end
of
*NL*
time
?
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
felt
that
this
might
be
the
case
,
and
she
did
n't
*NL*
like
it
;
though
very
probably
she
could
not
have
put
the
idea
into
*NL*
words
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
be
difficult
to
describe
the
animation
and
high
spirits
which
*NL*
distinguished
the
prince
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
so
happy
that
``
it
made
one
feel
happy
to
look
at
him
,
''
as
*NL*
Aglaya
's
sisters
expressed
it
afterwards
.
He
talked
,
and
told
stories
*NL*
just
as
he
had
done
once
before
,
and
never
since
,
namely
on
the
very
*NL*
first
morning
of
his
acquaintance
with
the
Epanchins
,
six
months
ago
.
*NL*
Since
his
return
to
Petersburg
from
Moscow
,
he
had
been
remarkably
*NL*
silent
,
and
had
told
Prince
S.
on
one
occasion
,
before
everyone
,
that
he
*NL*
did
not
think
himself
justified
in
degrading
any
thought
by
his
unworthy
*NL*
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
evening
he
did
nearly
all
the
talking
himself
,
and
told
stories
*NL*
by
the
dozen
,
while
he
answered
all
questions
put
to
him
clearly
,
*NL*
gladly
,
and
with
any
amount
of
detail
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
nothing
,
however
,
of
love-making
in
his
talk
.
His
ideas
were
*NL*
all
of
the
most
serious
kind
;
some
were
even
mystical
and
profound
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
aired
his
own
views
on
various
matters
,
some
of
his
most
private
*NL*
opinions
and
observations
,
many
of
which
would
have
seemed
rather
funny
,
*NL*
so
his
hearers
agreed
afterwards
,
had
they
not
been
so
well
expressed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
general
liked
serious
subjects
of
conversation
;
but
both
he
and
*NL*
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
felt
that
they
were
having
a
little
too
much
of
a
*NL*
good
thing
tonight
,
and
as
the
evening
advanced
,
they
both
grew
more
*NL*
or
less
melancholy
;
but
towards
night
,
the
prince
fell
to
telling
funny
*NL*
stories
,
and
was
always
the
first
to
burst
out
laughing
himself
,
which
*NL*
he
invariably
did
so
joyously
and
simply
that
the
rest
laughed
just
as
*NL*
much
at
him
as
at
his
stories
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Aglaya
,
she
hardly
said
a
word
all
the
evening
;
but
she
listened
*NL*
with
all
her
ears
to
Lef
Nicolaievitch
's
talk
,
and
scarcely
took
her
*NL*
eyes
off
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
looked
at
him
,
and
stared
and
stared
,
and
hung
on
every
word
he
*NL*
said
,
''
said
Lizabetha
afterwards
,
to
her
husband
,
``
and
yet
,
tell
her
*NL*
that
she
loves
him
,
and
she
is
furious
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
to
be
done
?
It
's
fate
,
''
said
the
general
,
shrugging
his
*NL*
shoulders
,
and
,
for
a
long
while
after
,
he
continued
to
repeat
:
``
It
's
*NL*
fate
,
it
's
fate
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
may
add
that
to
a
business
man
like
General
Epanchin
the
present
*NL*
position
of
affairs
was
most
unsatisfactory
.
He
hated
the
uncertainty
in
*NL*
which
they
had
been
,
perforce
,
left
.
However
,
he
decided
to
say
no
*NL*
more
about
it
,
and
merely
to
look
on
,
and
take
his
time
and
tune
from
*NL*
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
happy
state
in
which
the
family
had
spent
the
evening
,
as
just
*NL*
recorded
,
was
not
of
very
long
duration
.
Next
day
Aglaya
quarrelled
with
*NL*
the
prince
again
,
and
so
she
continued
to
behave
for
the
next
few
days
.
*NL*
For
whole
hours
at
a
time
she
ridiculed
and
chaffed
the
wretched
man
,
*NL*
and
made
him
almost
a
laughing-stock
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
true
that
they
used
to
sit
in
the
little
summer-house
together
for
*NL*
an
hour
or
two
at
a
time
,
very
often
,
but
it
was
observed
that
on
*NL*
these
occasions
the
prince
would
read
the
paper
,
or
some
book
,
aloud
to
*NL*
Aglaya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
''
Aglaya
said
to
him
once
,
interrupting
the
reading
,
``
I
've
*NL*
remarked
that
you
are
dreadfully
badly
educated
.
You
never
know
anything
*NL*
thoroughly
,
if
one
asks
you
;
neither
anyone
's
name
,
nor
dates
,
nor
about
*NL*
treaties
and
so
on
.
It
's
a
great
pity
,
you
know
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
you
I
had
not
had
much
of
an
education
,
''
replied
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
am
I
to
respect
you
,
if
that
's
the
case
?
Read
on
now
.
No
--
do
n't
!
*NL*
Stop
reading
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
once
more
,
that
same
evening
,
Aglaya
mystified
them
all
.
Prince
S.
*NL*
had
returned
,
and
Aglaya
was
particularly
amiable
to
him
,
and
asked
a
*NL*
great
deal
after
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
.
-LRB-
Muishkin
had
not
come
in
as
yet
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
Prince
S.
hinted
something
about
``
a
new
and
approaching
*NL*
change
in
the
family
.
''
He
was
led
to
this
remark
by
a
communication
*NL*
inadvertently
made
to
him
by
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
,
that
Adelaida
's
*NL*
marriage
must
be
postponed
a
little
longer
,
in
order
that
the
two
*NL*
weddings
might
come
off
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
impossible
to
describe
Aglaya
's
irritation
.
She
flared
up
,
and
*NL*
said
some
indignant
words
about
``
all
these
silly
insinuations
.
''
*NL*
She
added
that
``
she
had
no
intentions
as
yet
of
replacing
anybody
's
*NL*
mistress
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
words
painfully
impressed
the
whole
party
;
but
especially
her
*NL*
parents
.
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
summoned
a
secret
council
of
two
,
and
*NL*
insisted
upon
the
general
's
demanding
from
the
prince
a
full
explanation
*NL*
of
his
relations
with
Nastasia
Philipovna
.
The
general
argued
that
it
*NL*
was
only
a
whim
of
Aglaya
's
;
and
that
,
had
not
Prince
S.
unfortunately
*NL*
made
that
remark
,
which
had
confused
the
child
and
made
her
blush
,
she
*NL*
never
would
have
said
what
she
did
;
and
that
he
was
sure
Aglaya
knew
*NL*
well
that
anything
she
might
have
heard
of
the
prince
and
Nastasia
*NL*
Philipovna
was
merely
the
fabrication
of
malicious
tongues
,
and
that
*NL*
the
woman
was
going
to
marry
Rogojin
.
He
insisted
that
the
prince
had
*NL*
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
Nastasia
Philipovna
,
so
far
as
any
liaison
*NL*
was
concerned
;
and
,
if
the
truth
were
to
be
told
about
it
,
he
added
,
*NL*
never
had
had
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
nothing
put
the
prince
out
,
and
he
continued
to
be
in
the
*NL*
seventh
heaven
of
bliss
.
Of
course
he
could
not
fail
to
observe
some
*NL*
impatience
and
ill-temper
in
Aglaya
now
and
then
;
but
he
believed
in
*NL*
something
else
,
and
nothing
could
now
shake
his
conviction
.
Besides
,
*NL*
Aglaya
's
frowns
never
lasted
long
;
they
disappeared
of
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
he
was
too
easy
in
his
mind
.
So
thought
Hippolyte
,
at
all
*NL*
events
,
who
met
him
in
the
park
one
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
n't
I
tell
you
the
truth
now
,
when
I
said
you
were
in
love
?
''
he
*NL*
said
,
coming
up
to
Muishkin
of
his
own
accord
,
and
stopping
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
gave
him
his
hand
and
congratulated
him
upon
``
looking
so
*NL*
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hippolyte
himself
seemed
to
be
hopeful
about
his
state
of
health
,
as
is
*NL*
often
the
case
with
consumptives
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
approached
the
prince
with
the
intention
of
talking
sarcastically
*NL*
about
his
happy
expression
of
face
,
but
very
soon
forgot
his
intention
*NL*
and
began
to
talk
about
himself
.
He
began
complaining
about
everything
,
*NL*
disconnectedly
and
endlessly
,
as
was
his
wont
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
n't
believe
,
''
he
concluded
,
``
how
irritating
they
all
are
*NL*
there
.
They
are
such
wretchedly
small
,
vain
,
egotistical
,
_
commonplace
_
*NL*
people
!
Would
you
believe
it
,
they
invited
me
there
under
the
express
*NL*
condition
that
I
should
die
quickly
,
and
they
are
all
as
wild
as
*NL*
possible
with
me
for
not
having
died
yet
,
and
for
being
,
on
the
*NL*
contrary
,
a
good
deal
better
!
Is
n't
it
a
comedy
?
I
do
n't
mind
betting
*NL*
that
you
do
n't
believe
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
said
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
sometimes
think
of
coming
over
to
you
again
,
''
said
Hippolyte
,
*NL*
carelessly
.
``
So
you
_
do
n't
_
think
them
capable
of
inviting
a
man
on
*NL*
the
condition
that
he
is
to
look
sharp
and
die
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
certainly
thought
they
invited
you
with
quite
other
views
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ho
,
ho
!
you
are
not
nearly
so
simple
as
they
try
to
make
you
out
!
This
*NL*
is
not
the
time
for
it
,
or
I
would
tell
you
a
thing
or
two
about
that
*NL*
beauty
,
Gania
,
and
his
hopes
.
You
are
being
undermined
,
pitilessly
*NL*
undermined
,
and
--
and
it
is
really
melancholy
to
see
you
so
calm
about
*NL*
it
.
But
alas
!
it
's
your
nature
--
you
ca
n't
help
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
word
!
what
a
thing
to
be
melancholy
about
!
Why
,
do
you
think
I
*NL*
should
be
any
happier
if
I
were
to
feel
disturbed
about
the
excavations
*NL*
you
tell
me
of
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
better
to
be
unhappy
and
know
the
worst
,
than
to
be
happy
in
a
*NL*
fool
's
paradise
!
I
suppose
you
do
n't
believe
that
you
have
a
rival
in
*NL*
that
quarter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
insinuations
as
to
rivalry
are
rather
cynical
,
Hippolyte
.
I
'm
*NL*
sorry
to
say
I
have
no
right
to
answer
you
!
As
for
Gania
,
I
put
it
to
*NL*
you
,
_
can
_
any
man
have
a
happy
mind
after
passing
through
what
he
has
had
*NL*
to
suffer
?
I
think
that
is
the
best
way
to
look
at
it
.
He
will
*NL*
change
yet

he
has
lots
of
time
before
him

life
is
rich

the
prince
hesitated
.
``
As
to
being
undermined
,
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
what
in
the
world
you
are
driving
at

think
we

had
better
drop
the
subject

*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well

a
while

your
exalted

generous
way

You
must
put
out
your

touch
a

thing
before
you
'll
believe

Ha

I

What
do
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

Because
you

``
No

*NL*
*NL*
``

Aglaya
Ivanovna
*NL*
wished
to
see
you
,
after
she
had
read
your
confession
,
but
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
postponed
the
pleasure

I
see

I
quite
understand

said
Hippolyte
,
*NL*
hurriedly
,
as
though
he
wished
to
banish
the
subject
.
``
I
hear

they
*NL*
tell
me

that
you
read
her
all

Stupid

I

cruel

be
humiliating

we
'll
say
childishly
vain

revengeful
,
as
to
_
reproach
_
me
with
this
*NL*
confession

use
it
as
a
weapon

Do
n't

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

do
you

even
the
absurd
parts

it

many

-LRB-
here
Hippolyte
frowned
savagely

great
torture

perhaps

Whatever

I
give

my

see
this
more
plainly
every

I
do

not

I
merely
say
this

have
it
off
my

I
am
only
*NL*
sorry
that
I
did
not
say
it
all

''
*NL*
*NL*
Hippolyte
flushed
hotly
.
He
had
thought
at
first
that
the
prince
*NL*
was
``
humbugging
''
him
;
but
on
looking
at
his
face
he
saw
that
he
was
*NL*
absolutely
serious
,
and
had
no
thought
of
any
deception
.
Hippolyte
*NL*
beamed
with
gratification
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
I
must
die
,
''
he
said
,
and
almost
added
:
``
a
man
like
me
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
imagine
how
that
Gania
annoys
me
!
He
has
developed
the
idea
--
or
*NL*
pretends
to
believe
--
that
in
all
probability
three
or
four
others
who
*NL*
heard
my
confession
will
die
before
I
do
.
There
's
an
idea
for
you
--
and
*NL*
all
this
by
way
of
_
consoling
_
me
!
Ha
!
ha
!
ha
!
In
the
first
place
they
*NL*
have
n't
died
yet
;
and
in
the
second
,
if
they
_
did
_
die
--
all
of
them
--
what
*NL*
would
be
the
satisfaction
to
me
in
that
?
He
judges
me
by
himself
.
But
he
*NL*
goes
further
,
he
actually
pitches
into
me
because
,
as
he
declares
,
`
any
*NL*
decent
fellow
'
would
die
quietly
,
and
that
`
all
this
'
is
mere
egotism
*NL*
on
my
part

He
does
n't
see
what
refinement
of
egotism
it
is
on
his
own
*NL*
part
--
and
at
the
same
time
,
what
ox-like
coarseness
!
Have
you
ever
read
*NL*
of
the
death
of
one
Stepan
Gleboff
,
in
the
eighteenth
century

I
read
of

it
yesterday
by
chance

*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
was
he

impaled
on

time
of
Peter

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know

I
know

He
lay
there
fifteen
hours
in
the

most
extraordinary
fortitude

I
know

that
I
could
not
die
like
Gleboff
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
!
''
said
the
prince
,
blushing
.
``
I
was
only
going
to
say
that
*NL*
you
--
not
that
you
could
not
be
like
Gleboff
--
but
that
you
would
have
*NL*
been
more
like
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
guess
what
you
mean
--
I
should
be
an
Osterman
,
not
a
Gleboff
--
eh
?
Is
*NL*
that
what
you
meant
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
Osterman
?
''
asked
the
prince
in
some
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Osterman
--
the
diplomatist
.
Peter
's
Osterman
,
''
muttered
Hippolyte
,
*NL*
confused
.
There
was
a
moment
's
pause
of
mutual
confusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
no
!
''
said
the
prince
at
last
,
``
that
was
not
what
I
was
going
to
*NL*
say
--
oh
no
!
I
do
n't
think
you
would
ever
have
been
like
Osterman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hippolyte
frowned
gloomily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
why
I
draw
the
conclusion
,
''
explained
the
prince
,
*NL*
evidently
desirous
of
clearing
up
the
matter
a
little
.
``
Because
,
though
*NL*
I
often
think
over
the
men
of
those
times
,
I
can
not
for
the
life
of
me
*NL*
imagine
them
to
be
like
ourselves
.
It
really
appears
to
me
that
they
*NL*
were
of
another
race
altogether
than
ourselves
of
today
.
At
that
time
*NL*
people
seemed
to
stick
so
to
one
idea
;
now
,
they
are
more
nervous
,
more
*NL*
sensitive
,
more
enlightened
--
people
of
two
or
three
ideas
at
once
--
as
*NL*
it
were
.
The
man
of
today
is
a
broader
man
,
so
to
speak
--
and
I
declare
*NL*
I
believe
that
is
what
prevents
him
from
being
so
self-contained
and
*NL*
independent
a
being
as
his
brother
of
those
earlier
days
.
Of
course
my
*NL*
remark
was
only
made
under
this
impression
,
and
not
in
the
least
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
quite
understand
.
You
are
trying
to
comfort
me
for
the
naiveness
with
*NL*
which
you
disagreed
with
me
--
eh
?
Ha
!
ha
!
ha
!
You
are
a
regular
*NL*
child
,
prince
!
However
,
I
can
not
help
seeing
that
you
always
treat
me
*NL*
like
--
like
a
fragile
china
cup
.
Never
mind
,
never
mind
,
I
'm
not
a
bit
*NL*
angry
!
At
all
events
we
have
had
a
very
funny
talk
.
Do
you
know
,
all
*NL*
things
considered
,
I
should
like
to
be
something
better
than
Osterman
!
*NL*
I
would
n't
take
the
trouble
to
rise
from
the
dead
to
be
an
Osterman
.
*NL*
However
,
I
see
I
must
make
arrangements
to
die
soon
,
or
I
myself

.
*NL*
Well
--
leave
me
now
!
_
Au
revoir
.
_
Look
here
--
before
you
go
,
just
give
me
*NL*
your
opinion
:
how
do
you
think
I
ought
to
die
,
now
?
I
mean
--
the
best
,
*NL*
the
most
virtuous
way
?
Tell
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
pass
us
by
and
forgive
us
our
happiness
,
''
said
the
prince
in
*NL*
a
low
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
!
ha
!
ha
!
I
thought
so
.
I
thought
I
should
hear
something
like
*NL*
that

Well

you

you
really

oh

Eloquence

Good-bye

*NL*
As
to
the
evening
party
at
the
Epanchins
'
at
which
Princess
Bielokonski
*NL*
was
to
be
present
,
Varia
had
reported
with
accuracy
;
though
she
had
*NL*
perhaps
expressed
herself
too
strongly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
thing
was
decided
in
a
hurry
and
with
a
certain
amount
of
quite
*NL*
unnecessary
excitement
,
doubtless
because
``
nothing
could
be
done
in
this
*NL*
house
like
anywhere
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
impatience
of
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
``
to
get
things
settled
''
*NL*
explained
a
good
deal
,
as
well
as
the
anxiety
of
both
parents
for
the
*NL*
happiness
of
their
beloved
daughter
.
Besides
,
Princess
Bielokonski
was
*NL*
going
away
soon
,
and
they
hoped
that
she
would
take
an
interest
in
*NL*
the
prince
.
They
were
anxious
that
he
should
enter
society
under
the
*NL*
auspices
of
this
lady
,
whose
patronage
was
the
best
of
recommendations
*NL*
for
any
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
if
there
seems
something
strange
about
the
match
,
the
general
and
*NL*
his
wife
said
to
each
other
,
the
``
world
''
will
accept
Aglaya
's
fiance
*NL*
without
any
question
if
he
is
under
the
patronage
of
the
princess
.
In
*NL*
any
case
,
the
prince
would
have
to
be
``
shown
''
sooner
or
later
;
that
is
,
*NL*
introduced
into
society
,
of
which
he
had
,
so
far
,
not
the
least
idea
.
*NL*
Moreover
,
it
was
only
a
question
of
a
small
gathering
of
a
few
intimate
*NL*
friends
.
Besides
Princess
Bielokonski
,
only
one
other
lady
was
expected
,
*NL*
the
wife
of
a
high
dignitary
.
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
,
who
was
to
escort
the
*NL*
princess
,
was
the
only
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Muishkin
was
told
of
the
princess
's
visit
three
days
beforehand
,
but
*NL*
nothing
was
said
to
him
about
the
party
until
the
night
before
it
was
to
*NL*
take
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
help
observing
the
excited
and
agitated
condition
of
all
*NL*
members
of
the
family
,
and
from
certain
hints
dropped
in
conversation
he
*NL*
gathered
that
they
were
all
anxious
as
to
the
impression
he
should
*NL*
make
upon
the
princess
.
But
the
Epanchins
,
one
and
all
,
believed
that
*NL*
Muishkin
,
in
his
simplicity
of
mind
,
was
quite
incapable
of
realizing
*NL*
that
they
could
be
feeling
any
anxiety
on
his
account
,
and
for
this
*NL*
reason
they
all
looked
at
him
with
dread
and
uneasiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
point
of
fact
,
he
did
attach
marvellously
little
importance
to
the
*NL*
approaching
event
.
He
was
occupied
with
altogether
different
thoughts
.
*NL*
Aglaya
was
growing
hourly
more
capricious
and
gloomy
,
and
this
*NL*
distressed
him
.
When
they
told
him
that
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
was
expected
,
*NL*
he
evinced
great
delight
,
and
said
that
he
had
long
wished
to
see
*NL*
him
--
and
somehow
these
words
did
not
please
anyone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aglaya
left
the
room
in
a
fit
of
irritation
,
and
it
was
not
until
late
*NL*
in
the
evening
,
past
eleven
,
when
the
prince
was
taking
his
departure
,
*NL*
that
she
said
a
word
or
two
to
him
,
privately
,
as
she
accompanied
him
as
*NL*
far
as
the
front
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
you
,
''
she
said
,
``
not
to
come
here
tomorrow
until
evening
,
*NL*
when
the
guests
are
all
assembled
.
You
know
there
are
to
be
guests
,
*NL*
do
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
spoke
impatiently
and
with
severity
;
this
was
the
first
allusion
she
*NL*
had
made
to
the
party
of
tomorrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
hated
the
idea
of
it
,
everyone
saw
that
;
and
she
would
probably
*NL*
have
liked
to
quarrel
about
it
with
her
parents
,
but
pride
and
modesty
*NL*
prevented
her
from
broaching
the
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
Aglaya
,
too
,
was
nervous
about
*NL*
him
,
and
the
impression
he
would
make
,
and
that
she
did
not
like
to
*NL*
admit
her
anxiety
;
and
this
thought
alarmed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
am
invited
,
''
he
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
evidently
in
difficulties
as
to
how
best
to
go
on
.
``
May
I
speak
*NL*
of
something
serious
to
you
,
for
once
in
my
life
?
''
she
asked
,
angrily
.
*NL*
She
was
irritated
at
she
knew
not
what
,
and
could
not
restrain
her
*NL*
wrath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
you
may
;
I
am
very
glad
to
listen
,
''
replied
Muishkin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aglaya
was
silent
a
moment
and
then
began
again
with
evident
dislike
of
*NL*
her
subject
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
wish
to
quarrel
with
them
about
this
;
in
some
things
they
*NL*
wo
n't
be
reasonable
.
I
always
did
feel
a
loathing
for
the
laws
which
*NL*
seem
to
guide
mamma
's
conduct
at
times
.
I
do
n't
speak
of
father
,
for
*NL*
he
can
not
be
expected
to
be
anything
but
what
he
is
.
Mother
is
a
*NL*
noble-minded
woman
,
I
know
;
you
try
to
suggest
anything
mean
to
her
,
*NL*
and
you
'll
see
!
But
she
is
such
a
slave
to
these
miserable
creatures
!
I
*NL*
do
n't
mean
old
Bielokonski
alone
.
She
is
a
contemptible
old
thing
,
but
*NL*
she
is
able
to
twist
people
round
her
little
finger
,
and
I
admire
that
*NL*
in
her
,
at
all
events
!
How
mean
it
all
is
,
and
how
foolish
!
We
were
*NL*
always
middle-class
,
thoroughly
middle-class
,
people
.
Why
should
we
*NL*
attempt
to
climb
into
the
giddy
heights
of
the
fashionable
world
?
My
*NL*
sisters
are
all
for
it
.
It
's
Prince
S.
they
have
to
thank
for
poisoning
*NL*
their
minds
.
Why
are
you
so
glad
that
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
is
coming
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
to
me
,
Aglaya
,
''
said
the
prince
,
``
I
do
believe
you
are
nervous
*NL*
lest
I
shall
make
a
fool
of
myself
tomorrow
at
your
party
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nervous
about
you
?
''
Aglaya
blushed
.
``
Why
should
I
be
nervous
about
*NL*
you
?
What
would
it
matter
to
me
if
you
were
to
make
ever
such
a
fool
of
*NL*
yourself
?
How
can
you
say
such
a
thing
?
What
do
you
mean
by
`
making
a
*NL*
fool
of
yourself
'
?
What
a
vulgar
expression
!
I
suppose
you
intend
to
*NL*
talk
in
that
sort
of
way
tomorrow
evening
?
Look
up
a
few
more
such
*NL*
expressions
in
your
dictionary
;
do
,
you
'll
make
a
grand
effect
!
I
'm
*NL*
sorry
that
you
seem
to
be
able
to
come
into
a
room
as
gracefully
as
you
*NL*
do
;
where
did
you
learn
the
art
?
Do
you
think
you
can
drink
a
cup
of
tea
*NL*
decently
,
when
you
know
everybody
is
looking
at
you
,
on
purpose
to
see
*NL*
how
you
do
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
think
I
can

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
?
I
'm
sorry
for
it
then

I
should
have
had
a
good
laugh
at

you
otherwise

Do

Upset

the
Chinese
vase

It

a
valuable

``
On

serious

tactful

*NL*
``

happened

*NL*
come
in
appropriately

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
,
once
for
all
,
''
cried
Aglaya
,
boiling
over
,
``
if
I
hear
you
*NL*
talking
about
capital
punishment

the
economical
condition

She
certainly
did
say
this
very
*NL*
seriously
,
so
much
so
,
that
she
looked
quite
different
from
what
she
*NL*
usually
was
,
and
the
prince
could
not
help
noticing
the
fact
.
She
did
*NL*
not
seem
to
be
joking
in
the
slightest
degree

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

you
've
put

such
a
fright

very

break
something
too

alarmed

Aglaya
looked
blackly
at
him

*NL*
``
Do

away

said
the
prince
,
with
decision
.

*NL*
Aglaya
stamped
her
foot

grew
quite
pale
with
anger

``

wanted

suddenly
some
quite
unexpected

feeling
seized
upon

moment

*NL*
*NL*
``
Be

Aglaya
struck
in
,
suddenly
,
*NL*
seizing
his
hand
in
hers
,
and
gazing
at
him
almost
in
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
she
was
called
by
someone
.
She
broke
loose
from
him
with
*NL*
an
air
of
relief
and
ran
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
was
in
a
fever
all
night
.
It
was
strange
,
but
he
had
suffered
*NL*
from
fever
for
several
nights
in
succession
.
On
this
particular
night
,
*NL*
while
in
semi-delirium
,
he
had
an
idea
:
what
if
on
the
morrow
he
were
*NL*
to
have
a
fit
before
everybody
?
The
thought
seemed
to
freeze
his
blood
*NL*
within
him
.
All
night
he
fancied
himself
in
some
extraordinary
society
*NL*
of
strange
persons
.
The
worst
of
it
was
that
he
was
talking
nonsense
;
*NL*
he
knew
that
he
ought
not
to
speak
at
all
,
and
yet
he
talked
the
whole
*NL*
time
;
he
seemed
to
be
trying
to
persuade
them
all
to
something
.
Evgenie
*NL*
and
Hippolyte
were
among
the
guests
,
and
appeared
to
be
great
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
awoke
towards
nine
o'clock
with
a
headache
,
full
of
confused
ideas
*NL*
and
strange
impressions
.
For
some
reason
or
other
he
felt
most
anxious
*NL*
to
see
Rogojin
,
to
see
and
talk
to
him
,
but
what
he
wished
to
say
he
*NL*
could
not
tell
.
Next
,
he
determined
to
go
and
see
Hippolyte
.
His
mind
*NL*
was
in
a
confused
state
,
so
much
so
that
the
incidents
of
the
morning
*NL*
seemed
to
be
imperfectly
realized
,
though
acutely
felt
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
these
incidents
was
a
visit
from
Lebedeff
.
Lebedeff
came
rather
*NL*
early
--
before
ten
--
but
he
was
tipsy
already
.
Though
the
prince
was
not
*NL*
in
an
observant
condition
,
yet
he
could
not
avoid
seeing
that
for
at
*NL*
least
three
days
--
ever
since
General
Ivolgin
had
left
the
house
Lebedeff
*NL*
had
been
behaving
very
badly
.
He
looked
untidy
and
dirty
at
all
times
*NL*
of
the
day
,
and
it
was
said
that
he
had
begun
to
rage
about
in
his
own
*NL*
house
,
and
that
his
temper
was
very
bad
.
As
soon
as
he
arrived
this
*NL*
morning
,
he
began
to
hold
forth
,
beating
his
breast
and
apparently
*NL*
blaming
himself
for
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
--
I
've
had
a
reward
for
my
meanness
--
I
've
had
a
slap
in
the
face
,
''
*NL*
he
concluded
,
tragically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
slap
in
the
face
?
From
whom
?
And
so
early
in
the
morning
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Early
?
''
said
Lebedeff
,
sarcastically
.
``
Time
counts
for
nothing
,
even
in
*NL*
physical
chastisement
;
but
my
slap
in
the
face
was
not
physical
,
it
was
*NL*
moral
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
suddenly
took
a
seat
,
very
unceremoniously
,
and
began
his
story
.
It
*NL*
was
very
disconnected
;
the
prince
frowned
,
and
wished
he
could
get
away
;
*NL*
but
suddenly
a
few
words
struck
him
.
He
sat
stiff
with
wonder
--
Lebedeff
*NL*
said
some
extraordinary
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
first
place
he
began
about
some
letter
;
the
name
of
Aglaya
*NL*
Ivanovna
came
in
.
Then
suddenly
he
broke
off
and
began
to
accuse
the
*NL*
prince
of
something
;
he
was
apparently
offended
with
him
.
At
first
he
*NL*
declared
that
the
prince
had
trusted
him
with
his
confidences
as
to
``
a
*NL*
certain
person
''
-LRB-
Nastasia
Philipovna
-RRB-
,
but
that
of
late
his
friendship
*NL*
had
been
thrust
back
into
his
bosom
,
and
his
innocent
question
as
to
*NL*
``
approaching
family
changes
''
had
been
curtly
put
aside
,
which
Lebedeff
*NL*
declared
,
with
tipsy
tears
,
he
could
not
bear
;
especially
as
he
knew
so
*NL*
much
already
both
from
Rogojin
and
Nastasia
Philipovna
and
her
friend
,
*NL*
and
from
Varvara
Ardalionovna
,
and
even
from
Aglaya
Ivanovna
,
through
*NL*
his
daughter
Vera
.
``
And
who
told
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
something
in
*NL*
secret
,
by
letter
?
Who
told
her
all
about
the
movements
of
a
certain
*NL*
person
called
Nastasia
Philipovna
?
Who
was
the
anonymous
person
,
eh
?
*NL*
Tell
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
not
you
?
''
cried
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
so
,
''
said
Lebedeff
,
with
dignity
;
``
and
only
this
very
morning
I
*NL*
have
sent
up
a
letter
to
the
noble
lady
,
stating
that
I
have
a
matter
of
*NL*
great
importance
to
communicate
.
She
received
the
letter
;
I
know
she
got
*NL*
it
;
and
she
received
_
me
_
,
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
just
seen
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
?
''
asked
the
prince
,
scarcely
*NL*
believing
his
ears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
saw
her
,
and
got
the
said
slap
in
the
face
as
mentioned
.
She
*NL*
chucked
the
letter
back
to
me
unopened
,
and
kicked
me
out
of
the
house
,
*NL*
morally
,
not
physically
,
although
not
far
off
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
letter
do
you
mean
she
returned
unopened
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
did
n't
I
tell
you
?
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
I
thought
I
had
.
Why
,
I
received
a
*NL*
letter
,
you
know
,
to
be
handed
over
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
whom
?
To
whom
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
difficult
,
if
not
impossible
,
to
extract
anything
from
*NL*
Lebedeff
.
All
the
prince
could
gather
was
,
that
the
letter
had
been
*NL*
received
very
early
,
and
had
a
request
written
on
the
outside
that
it
*NL*
might
be
sent
on
to
the
address
given
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
as
before
,
sir
,
just
as
before
!
To
a
certain
person
,
and
from
*NL*
a
certain
hand
.
The
individual
's
name
who
wrote
the
letter
is
to
be
*NL*
represented
by
the
letter
A.
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
Impossible
!
To
Nastasia
Philipovna
?
Nonsense
!
''
cried
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
,
I
assure
you
,
and
if
not
to
her
then
to
Rogojin
,
which
is
*NL*
the
same
thing
.
Mr.
Hippolyte
has
had
letters
,
too
,
and
all
from
the
*NL*
individual
whose
name
begins
with
an
A.
,
''
smirked
Lebedeff
,
with
a
*NL*
hideous
grin
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
kept
jumping
from
subject
to
subject
,
and
forgetting
what
he
had
*NL*
begun
to
talk
about
,
the
prince
said
nothing
,
but
waited
,
to
give
him
*NL*
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
all
very
vague
.
Who
had
taken
the
letters
,
if
letters
there
were
?
*NL*
Probably
Vera
--
and
how
could
Lebedeff
have
got
them
?
In
all
probability
,
*NL*
he
had
managed
to
steal
the
present
letter
from
Vera
,
and
had
himself
*NL*
gone
over
to
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
with
some
idea
in
his
head
.
So
the
*NL*
prince
concluded
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
mad
!
''
he
cried
,
indignantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
quite
,
esteemed
prince
,
''
replied
Lebedeff
,
with
some
acerbity
.
``
I
*NL*
confess
I
thought
of
doing
you
the
service
of
handing
the
letter
over
to
*NL*
yourself
,
but
I
decided
that
it
would
pay
me
better
to
deliver
it
up
to
*NL*
the
noble
lady
aforesaid
,
as
I
had
informed
her
of
everything
hitherto
*NL*
by
anonymous
letters
;
so
when
I
sent
her
up
a
note
from
myself
,
with
*NL*
the
letter
,
you
know
,
in
order
to
fix
a
meeting
for
eight
o'clock
this
*NL*
morning
,
I
signed
it
`
your
secret
correspondent
.
'
They
let
me
in
at
*NL*
once
--
very
quickly
--
by
the
back
door
,
and
the
noble
lady
received
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
Go
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
,
when
I
saw
her
she
almost
punched
my
head
,
as
I
say
;
in
fact
*NL*
so
nearly
that
one
might
almost
say
she
did
punch
my
head
.
She
threw
*NL*
the
letter
in
my
face
;
she
seemed
to
reflect
first
,
as
if
she
would
*NL*
have
liked
to
keep
it
,
but
thought
better
of
it
and
threw
it
in
my
face
*NL*
instead
.
`
If
anybody
can
have
been
such
a
fool
as
to
trust
a
man
like
*NL*
you
to
deliver
the
letter

says
she
,
'
take
it
and
deliver
it

`
Hey
!
she
*NL*
was
grandly
indignant

A
fierce

fiery
lady
that

sir

*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
's
the
letter
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
've
still
got
it
,
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
handed
the
prince
the
very
letter
from
Aglaya
to
Gania
,
which
the
*NL*
latter
showed
with
so
much
triumph
to
his
sister
at
a
later
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
letter
can
not
be
allowed
to
remain
in
your

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
for
you

for
you

I
've
brought
it
you
on
purpose

''
cried
Lebedeff
,
*NL*
excitedly
.
``
Why
,
I
'm
yours
again
now
,
heart
and
hand

your
slave

there
*NL*
was
but
a
momentary
pause
in
the
flow
of
my
love

esteem
for

Mea

the
Pope

Rome
says

*NL*
``

the
prince

disturbed
.

over

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
Lebedeff
made
a
strange
and
very
expressive
grimace
;
he
twisted
about
in
*NL*
his
chair
,
and
did
something
,
apparently
symbolical
,
with
his
hands

*NL*
*NL*
``
What

*NL*
``
Why

he
said
,
most
*NL*
confidentially
and
mysteriously
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
jumped
up
so
furiously
that
Lebedeff
ran
towards
the
door
;
*NL*
having
gained
which
strategic
position
,
however
,
he
stopped
and
looked
*NL*
back
to
see
if
he
might
hope
for
pardon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Lebedeff
,
Lebedeff
!
Can
a
man
really
sink
to
such
depths
of
*NL*
meanness

said
the
prince
,
sadly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lebedeff
's
face
brightened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'm
a
mean
wretch

a

wretch

he
said
,
approaching
the
prince
*NL*
once
more
,
and
beating
his
breast
,
with
tears
in
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*

do
;
now
leave
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
injunction
had
to
be
repeated
several
times
before
the
man
could
be
*NL*
persuaded
to
move
.
Even
then
he
turned
back
at
the
door
,
came
as
far
as
*NL*
the
middle
of
the
room
,
and
there
went
through
his
mysterious
motions
*NL*
designed
to
convey
the
suggestion
that
the
prince
should
open
the
*NL*
letter
.
He
did
not
dare
put
his
suggestion
into
words
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
performance
,
he
smiled
sweetly
and
left
the
room
on
tiptoe
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
had
been
very
painful
to
listen
to
.
One
fact
stood
out
certain
*NL*
and
clear
,
and
that
was
that
poor
Aglaya
must
be
in
a
state
of
great
*NL*
distress
and
indecision
and
mental
torment
-LRB-
``
from
jealousy
,
''
the
prince
*NL*
whispered
to
himself
-RRB-
.
Undoubtedly
in
this
inexperienced
,
but
hot
and
*NL*
proud
little
head
,
there
were
all
sorts
of
plans
forming
,
wild
and
*NL*
impossible
plans
,
maybe
;
and
the
idea
of
this
so
frightened
the
prince
*NL*
that
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
what
to
do
.
Something
must
be
done
,
*NL*
that
was
clear
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
the
address
on
the
letter
once
more
.
Oh
,
he
was
not
in
the
*NL*
least
degree
alarmed
about
Aglaya
writing
such
a
letter
;
he
could
trust
*NL*
her
.
What
he
did
not
like
about
it
was
that
he
could
not
trust
Gania
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
he
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
himself
take
the
note
and
*NL*
deliver
it
.
Indeed
,
he
went
so
far
as
to
leave
the
house
and
walk
up
the
*NL*
road
,
but
changed
his
mind
when
he
had
nearly
reached
Ptitsin
's
door
.
*NL*
However
,
he
there
luckily
met
Colia
,
and
commissioned
him
to
deliver
the
*NL*
letter
to
his
brother
as
if
direct
from
Aglaya
.
Colia
asked
no
questions
*NL*
but
simply
delivered
it
,
and
Gania
consequently
had
no
suspicion
that
it
*NL*
had
passed
through
so
many
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arrived
home
again
,
the
prince
sent
for
Vera
Lebedeff
and
told
her
as
*NL*
much
as
was
necessary
,
in
order
to
relieve
her
mind
,
for
she
had
been
in
*NL*
a
dreadful
state
of
anxiety
since
she
had
missed
the
letter
.
She
heard
*NL*
with
horror
that
her
father
had
taken
it
.
Muishkin
learned
from
her
that
*NL*
she
had
on
several
occasions
performed
secret
missions
both
for
Aglaya
*NL*
and
for
Rogojin
,
without
,
however
,
having
had
the
slightest
idea
that
in
*NL*
so
doing
she
might
injure
the
prince
in
any
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
,
with
one
thing
and
another
,
was
now
so
disturbed
and
*NL*
confused
,
that
when
,
a
couple
of
hours
or
so
later
,
a
message
came
from
*NL*
Colia
that
the
general
was
ill
,
he
could
hardly
take
the
news
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
when
he
did
master
the
fact
,
it
acted
upon
him
as
a
tonic
*NL*
by
completely
distracting
his
attention
.
He
went
at
once
to
Nina
*NL*
Alexandrovna
's
,
whither
the
general
had
been
carried
,
and
stayed
there
*NL*
until
the
evening
.
He
could
do
no
good
,
but
there
are
people
whom
*NL*
to
have
near
one
is
a
blessing
at
such
times
.
Colia
was
in
an
almost
*NL*
hysterical
state
;
he
cried
continuously
,
but
was
running
about
all
day
,
*NL*
all
the
same
;
fetching
doctors
,
of
whom
he
collected
three
;
going
to
the
*NL*
chemist
's
,
and
so
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
general
was
brought
round
to
some
extent
,
but
the
doctors
*NL*
declared
that
he
could
not
be
said
to
be
out
of
danger
.
Varia
and
Nina
*NL*
Alexandrovna
never
left
the
sick
man
's
bedside
;
Gania
was
excited
and
*NL*
distressed
,
but
would
not
go
upstairs
,
and
seemed
afraid
to
look
at
the
*NL*
patient
.
He
wrung
his
hands
when
the
prince
spoke
to
him
,
and
said
that
*NL*
``
such
a
misfortune
at
such
a
moment
''
was
terrible
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
thought
he
knew
what
Gania
meant
by
``
such
a
moment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hippolyte
was
not
in
the
house
.
Lebedeff
turned
up
late
in
the
*NL*
afternoon
;
he
had
been
asleep
ever
since
his
interview
with
the
prince
*NL*
in
the
morning
.
He
was
quite
sober
now
,
and
cried
with
real
sincerity
*NL*
over
the
sick
general
--
mourning
for
him
as
though
he
were
his
own
*NL*
brother
.
He
blamed
himself
aloud
,
but
did
not
explain
why
.
He
repeated
*NL*
over
and
over
again
to
Nina
Alexandrovna
that
he
alone
was
to
blame
--
no
*NL*
one
else
--
but
that
he
had
acted
out
of
``
pure
amiable
curiosity
,
''
and
*NL*
that
``
the
deceased
,
''
as
he
insisted
upon
calling
the
still
living
*NL*
general
,
had
been
the
greatest
of
geniuses
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
laid
much
stress
on
the
genius
of
the
sufferer
,
as
if
this
idea
must
*NL*
be
one
of
immense
solace
in
the
present
crisis
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nina
Alexandrovna
--
seeing
his
sincerity
of
feeling
--
said
at
last
,
*NL*
and
without
the
faintest
suspicion
of
reproach
in
her
voice
:
``
Come
,
*NL*
come
--
do
n't
cry
!
God
will
forgive
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lebedeff
was
so
impressed
by
these
words
,
and
the
tone
in
which
*NL*
they
were
spoken
,
that
he
could
not
leave
Nina
Alexandrovna
all
the
*NL*
evening
--
in
fact
,
for
several
days
.
Till
the
general
's
death
,
indeed
,
he
*NL*
spent
almost
all
his
time
at
his
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
Twice
during
the
day
a
messenger
came
to
Nina
Alexandrovna
from
the
*NL*
Epanchins
to
inquire
after
the
invalid
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
--
late
in
the
evening
--
the
prince
made
his
appearance
in
Lizabetha
*NL*
Prokofievna
's
drawing-room
,
he
found
it
full
of
guests
.
Mrs.
Epanchin
*NL*
questioned
him
very
fully
about
the
general
as
soon
as
he
appeared
;
and
*NL*
when
old
Princess
Bielokonski
wished
to
know
``
who
this
general
was
,
and
*NL*
who
was
Nina
Alexandrovna
,
''
she
proceeded
to
explain
in
a
manner
which
*NL*
pleased
the
prince
very
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
himself
,
when
relating
the
circumstances
of
the
general
's
illness
to
*NL*
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
,
``
spoke
beautifully
,
''
as
Aglaya
's
sisters
declared
*NL*
afterwards
--
``
modestly
,
quietly
,
without
gestures
or
too
many
words
,
and
*NL*
with
great
dignity
.
''
He
had
entered
the
room
with
propriety
and
grace
,
*NL*
and
he
was
perfectly
dressed
;
he
not
only
did
not
``
fall
down
on
the
*NL*
slippery
floor
,
''
as
he
had
expressed
it
,
but
evidently
made
a
very
*NL*
favourable
impression
upon
the
assembled
guests
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
his
own
impression
on
entering
the
room
and
taking
his
seat
,
*NL*
he
instantly
remarked
that
the
company
was
not
in
the
least
such
*NL*
as
Aglaya
's
words
had
led
him
to
fear
,
and
as
he
had
dreamed
of
--
in
*NL*
nightmare
form
--
all
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
first
time
in
his
life
that
he
had
seen
a
little
corner
of
*NL*
what
was
generally
known
by
the
terrible
name
of
``
society
.
''
He
had
long
*NL*
thirsted
,
for
reasons
of
his
own
,
to
penetrate
the
mysteries
of
the
*NL*
magic
circle
,
and
,
therefore
,
this
assemblage
was
of
the
greatest
*NL*
possible
interest
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
first
impression
was
one
of
fascination
.
Somehow
or
other
he
felt
*NL*
that
all
these
people
must
have
been
born
on
purpose
to
be
together
!
It
*NL*
seemed
to
him
that
the
Epanchins
were
not
having
a
party
at
all
;
that
*NL*
these
people
must
have
been
here
always
,
and
that
he
himself
was
one
*NL*
of
them
--
returned
among
them
after
a
long
absence
,
but
one
of
them
,
*NL*
naturally
and
indisputably
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
never
struck
him
that
all
this
refined
simplicity
and
nobility
and
*NL*
wit
and
personal
dignity
might
possibly
be
no
more
than
an
exquisite
*NL*
artistic
polish
.
The
majority
of
the
guests
--
who
were
somewhat
*NL*
empty-headed
,
after
all
,
in
spite
of
their
aristocratic
bearing
--
never
*NL*
guessed
,
in
their
self-satisfied
composure
,
that
much
of
their
*NL*
superiority
was
mere
veneer
,
which
indeed
they
had
adopted
unconsciously
*NL*
and
by
inheritance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
would
never
so
much
as
suspect
such
a
thing
in
the
delight
of
*NL*
his
first
impression
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
saw
,
for
instance
,
that
one
important
dignitary
,
old
enough
to
be
his
*NL*
grandfather
,
broke
off
his
own
conversation
in
order
to
listen
to
_
him
_
--
a
*NL*
young
and
inexperienced
man
;
and
not
only
listened
,
but
seemed
to
*NL*
attach
value
to
his
opinion
,
and
was
kind
and
amiable
,
and
yet
they
*NL*
were
strangers
and
had
never
seen
each
other
before
.
Perhaps
what
most
*NL*
appealed
to
the
prince
's
impressionability
was
the
refinement
of
the
old
*NL*
man
's
courtesy
towards
him
.
Perhaps
the
soil
of
his
susceptible
nature
*NL*
was
really
predisposed
to
receive
a
pleasant
impression
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
all
these
people-though
friends
of
the
family
and
of
each
*NL*
other
to
a
certain
extent
--
were
very
far
from
being
such
intimate
*NL*
friends
of
the
family
and
of
each
other
as
the
prince
concluded
.
There
*NL*
were
some
present
who
never
would
think
of
considering
the
Epanchins
*NL*
their
equals
.
There
were
even
some
who
hated
one
another
cordially
.
For
*NL*
instance
,
old
Princess
Bielokonski
had
all
her
life
despised
the
wife
*NL*
of
the
``
dignitary
,
''
while
the
latter
was
very
far
from
loving
Lizabetha
*NL*
Prokofievna
.
The
dignitary
himself
had
been
General
Epanchin
's
protector
*NL*
from
his
youth
up
;
and
the
general
considered
him
so
majestic
a
*NL*
personage
that
he
would
have
felt
a
hearty
contempt
for
himself
if
*NL*
he
had
even
for
one
moment
allowed
himself
to
pose
as
the
great
man
's
*NL*
equal
,
or
to
think
of
him
--
in
his
fear
and
reverence-as
anything
less
*NL*
than
an
Olympic
God
!
There
were
others
present
who
had
not
met
for
*NL*
years
,
and
who
had
no
feeling
whatever
for
each
other
,
unless
it
were
*NL*
dislike
;
and
yet
they
met
tonight
as
though
they
had
seen
each
other
but
*NL*
yesterday
in
some
friendly
and
intimate
assembly
of
kindred
spirits
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
a
large
party
,
however
.
Besides
Princess
Bielokonski
and
the
*NL*
old
dignitary
-LRB-
who
was
really
a
great
man
-RRB-
and
his
wife
,
there
was
an
*NL*
old
military
general
--
a
count
or
baron
with
a
German
name
,
a
man
reputed
*NL*
to
possess
great
knowledge
and
administrative
ability
.
He
was
one
*NL*
of
those
Olympian
administrators
who
know
everything
except
Russia
,
*NL*
pronounce
a
word
of
extraordinary
wisdom
,
admired
by
all
,
about
once
in
*NL*
five
years
,
and
,
after
being
an
eternity
in
the
service
,
generally
die
*NL*
full
of
honour
and
riches
,
though
they
have
never
done
anything
great
,
*NL*
and
have
even
been
hostile
to
all
greatness
.
This
general
was
Ivan
*NL*
Fedorovitch
's
immediate
superior
in
the
service
;
and
it
pleased
the
*NL*
latter
to
look
upon
him
also
as
a
patron
.
On
the
other
hand
,
the
great
*NL*
man
did
not
at
all
consider
himself
Epanchin
's
patron
.
He
was
always
*NL*
very
cool
to
him
,
while
taking
advantage
of
his
ready
services
,
and
*NL*
would
instantly
have
put
another
in
his
place
if
there
had
been
the
*NL*
slightest
reason
for
the
change
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
guest
was
an
elderly
,
important-looking
gentleman
,
a
distant
*NL*
relative
of
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
's
.
This
gentleman
was
rich
,
held
a
*NL*
good
position
,
was
a
great
talker
,
and
had
the
reputation
of
being
``
one
*NL*
of
the
dissatisfied
,
''
though
not
belonging
to
the
dangerous
sections
*NL*
of
that
class
.
He
had
the
manners
,
to
some
extent
,
of
the
English
*NL*
aristocracy
,
and
some
of
their
tastes
-LRB-
especially
in
the
matter
of
*NL*
under-done
roast
beef
,
harness
,
men-servants
,
etc.
-RRB-
.
He
was
a
great
*NL*
friend
of
the
dignitary
's
,
and
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
,
for
some
reason
or
*NL*
other
,
had
got
hold
of
the
idea
that
this
worthy
intended
at
no
distant
*NL*
date
to
offer
the
advantages
of
his
hand
and
heart
to
Alexandra
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
the
elevated
and
more
solid
individuals
enumerated
,
there
were
*NL*
present
a
few
younger
though
not
less
elegant
guests
.
Besides
Prince
S.
*NL*
and
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
,
we
must
name
the
eminent
and
fascinating
Prince
*NL*
N.
--
once
the
vanquisher
of
female
hearts
all
over
Europe
.
This
gentleman
*NL*
was
no
longer
in
the
first
bloom
of
youth
--
he
was
forty-five
,
but
still
*NL*
very
handsome
.
He
was
well
off
,
and
lived
,
as
a
rule
,
abroad
,
and
was
*NL*
noted
as
a
good
teller
of
stories
.
Then
came
a
few
guests
belonging
to
*NL*
a
lower
stratum
of
society
--
people
who
,
like
the
Epanchins
themselves
,
*NL*
moved
only
occasionally
in
this
exalted
sphere
.
The
Epanchins
liked
to
*NL*
draft
among
their
more
elevated
guests
a
few
picked
representatives
of
*NL*
this
lower
stratum
,
and
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
received
much
praise
for
*NL*
this
practice
,
which
proved
,
her
friends
said
,
that
she
was
a
woman
of
*NL*
tact
.
The
Epanchins
prided
themselves
upon
the
good
opinion
people
held
*NL*
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
representatives
of
the
middle-class
present
today
was
a
*NL*
colonel
of
engineers
,
a
very
serious
man
and
a
great
friend
of
Prince
*NL*
S.
,
who
had
introduced
him
to
the
Epanchins
.
He
was
extremely
silent
in
*NL*
society
,
and
displayed
on
the
forefinger
of
his
right
hand
a
large
ring
,
*NL*
probably
bestowed
upon
him
for
services
of
some
sort
.
There
was
also
*NL*
a
poet
,
German
by
name
,
but
a
Russian
poet
;
very
presentable
,
and
even
*NL*
handsome-the
sort
of
man
one
could
bring
into
society
with
impunity
.
*NL*
This
gentleman
belonged
to
a
German
family
of
decidedly
bourgeois
*NL*
origin
,
but
he
had
a
knack
of
acquiring
the
patronage
of
``
big-wigs
,
''
and
*NL*
of
retaining
their
favour
.
He
had
translated
some
great
German
poem
into
*NL*
Russian
verse
,
and
claimed
to
have
been
a
friend
of
a
famous
Russian
*NL*
poet
,
since
dead
.
-LRB-
It
is
strange
how
great
a
multitude
of
literary
*NL*
people
there
are
who
have
had
the
advantages
of
friendship
with
some
*NL*
great
man
of
their
own
profession
who
is
,
unfortunately
,
dead
.
-RRB-
The
*NL*
dignitary
's
wife
had
introduced
this
worthy
to
the
Epanchins
.
This
*NL*
lady
posed
as
the
patroness
of
literary
people
,
and
she
certainly
*NL*
had
succeeded
in
obtaining
pensions
for
a
few
of
them
,
thanks
to
her
*NL*
influence
with
those
in
authority
on
such
matters
.
She
was
a
lady
of
*NL*
weight
in
her
own
way
.
Her
age
was
about
forty-five
,
so
that
she
was
a
*NL*
very
young
wife
for
such
an
elderly
husband
as
the
dignitary
.
She
had
*NL*
been
a
beauty
in
her
day
and
still
loved
,
as
many
ladies
of
forty-five
*NL*
do
love
,
to
dress
a
little
too
smartly
.
Her
intellect
was
nothing
to
*NL*
boast
of
,
and
her
literary
knowledge
very
doubtful
.
Literary
patronage
*NL*
was
,
however
,
with
her
as
much
a
mania
as
was
the
love
of
gorgeous
*NL*
clothes
.
Many
books
and
translations
were
dedicated
to
her
by
her
*NL*
proteges
,
and
a
few
of
these
talented
individuals
had
published
some
of
*NL*
their
own
letters
to
her
,
upon
very
weighty
subjects
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
,
then
,
was
the
society
that
the
prince
accepted
at
once
as
true
*NL*
coin
,
as
pure
gold
without
alloy
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
so
happened
,
however
,
that
on
this
particular
evening
all
these
good
*NL*
people
were
in
excellent
humour
and
highly
pleased
with
themselves
.
*NL*
Every
one
of
them
felt
that
they
were
doing
the
Epanchins
the
greatest
*NL*
possible
honour
by
their
presence
.
But
alas
!
the
prince
never
suspected
*NL*
any
such
subtleties
!
For
instance
,
he
had
no
suspicion
of
the
fact
that
*NL*
the
Epanchins
,
having
in
their
mind
so
important
a
step
as
the
marriage
*NL*
of
their
daughter
,
would
never
think
of
presuming
to
take
it
without
*NL*
having
previously
``
shown
off
''
the
proposed
husband
to
the
dignitary
--
the
*NL*
recognized
patron
of
the
family
.
The
latter
,
too
,
though
he
would
*NL*
probably
have
received
news
of
a
great
disaster
to
the
Epanchin
family
*NL*
with
perfect
composure
,
would
nevertheless
have
considered
it
a
personal
*NL*
offence
if
they
had
dared
to
marry
their
daughter
without
his
advice
,
or
*NL*
we
might
almost
say
,
his
leave
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
amiable
and
undoubtedly
witty
Prince
N.
could
not
but
feel
that
*NL*
he
was
as
a
sun
,
risen
for
one
night
only
to
shine
upon
the
Epanchin
*NL*
drawing-room
.
He
accounted
them
immeasurably
his
inferiors
,
and
it
was
*NL*
this
feeling
which
caused
his
special
amiability
and
delightful
ease
and
*NL*
grace
towards
them
.
He
knew
very
well
that
he
must
tell
some
story
this
*NL*
evening
for
the
edification
of
the
company
,
and
led
up
to
it
with
the
*NL*
inspiration
of
anticipatory
triumph
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
,
when
he
heard
the
story
afterwards
,
felt
that
he
had
never
*NL*
yet
come
across
so
wonderful
a
humorist
,
or
such
remarkable
brilliancy
*NL*
as
was
shown
by
this
man
;
and
yet
if
he
had
only
known
it
,
this
story
*NL*
was
the
oldest
,
stalest
,
and
most
worn-out
yarn
,
and
every
drawing-room
*NL*
in
town
was
sick
to
death
of
it
.
It
was
only
in
the
innocent
Epanchin
*NL*
household
that
it
passed
for
a
new
and
brilliant
tale
--
as
a
sudden
and
*NL*
striking
reminiscence
of
a
splendid
and
talented
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
the
German
poet
,
though
as
amiable
as
possible
,
felt
that
he
was
*NL*
doing
the
house
the
greatest
of
honours
by
his
presence
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
prince
only
looked
at
the
bright
side
;
he
did
not
turn
the
coat
*NL*
and
see
the
shabby
lining
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aglaya
had
not
foreseen
that
particular
calamity
.
She
herself
looked
*NL*
wonderfully
beautiful
this
evening
.
All
three
sisters
were
dressed
very
*NL*
tastefully
,
and
their
hair
was
done
with
special
care
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aglaya
sat
next
to
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
,
and
laughed
and
talked
to
him
*NL*
with
an
unusual
display
of
friendliness
.
Evgenie
himself
behaved
rather
*NL*
more
sedately
than
usual
,
probably
out
of
respect
to
the
dignitary
.
*NL*
Evgenie
had
been
known
in
society
for
a
long
while
.
He
had
appeared
at
*NL*
the
Epanchins
'
today
with
crape
on
his
hat
,
and
Princess
Bielokonski
had
*NL*
commended
this
action
on
his
part
.
Not
every
society
man
would
have
worn
*NL*
crape
for
``
such
an
uncle
.
''
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
had
liked
it
also
,
but
*NL*
was
too
preoccupied
to
take
much
notice
.
The
prince
remarked
that
Aglaya
*NL*
looked
attentively
at
him
two
or
three
times
,
and
seemed
to
be
satisfied
*NL*
with
his
behaviour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
by
little
he
became
very
happy
indeed
.
All
his
late
anxieties
and
*NL*
apprehensions
-LRB-
after
his
conversation
with
Lebedeff
-RRB-
now
appeared
like
*NL*
so
many
bad
dreams
--
impossible
,
and
even
laughable
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
speak
much
,
only
answering
such
questions
as
were
put
to
him
,
*NL*
and
gradually
settled
down
into
unbroken
silence
,
listening
to
what
went
*NL*
on
,
and
steeped
in
perfect
satisfaction
and
contentment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
by
little
a
sort
of
inspiration
,
however
,
began
to
stir
within
*NL*
him
,
ready
to
spring
into
life
at
the
right
moment
.
When
he
did
begin
*NL*
to
speak
,
it
was
accidentally
,
in
response
to
a
question
,
and
apparently
*NL*
without
any
special
object
.
*NL*
*NL*
VII
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
he
feasted
his
eyes
upon
Aglaya
,
as
she
talked
merrily
with
*NL*
Evgenie
and
Prince
N.
,
suddenly
the
old
anglomaniac
,
who
was
talking
to
*NL*
the
dignitary
in
another
corner
of
the
room
,
apparently
telling
him
a
*NL*
story
about
something
or
other
--
suddenly
this
gentleman
pronounced
*NL*
the
name
of
``
Nicolai
Andreevitch
Pavlicheff
''
aloud
.
The
prince
quickly
*NL*
turned
towards
him
,
and
listened
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
conversation
had
been
on
the
subject
of
land
,
and
the
present
*NL*
disorders
,
and
there
must
have
been
something
amusing
said
,
for
the
old
*NL*
man
had
begun
to
laugh
at
his
companion
's
heated
expressions
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
was
describing
in
eloquent
words
how
,
in
consequence
of
*NL*
recent
legislation
,
he
was
obliged
to
sell
a
beautiful
estate
in
the
N.
*NL*
province
,
not
because
he
wanted
ready
money
--
in
fact
,
he
was
obliged
*NL*
to
sell
it
at
half
its
value
.
``
To
avoid
another
lawsuit
about
the
*NL*
Pavlicheff
estate
,
I
ran
away
,
''
he
said
.
``
With
a
few
more
inheritances
*NL*
of
that
kind
I
should
soon
be
ruined
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
point
General
Epanchin
,
noticing
how
interested
Muishkin
had
*NL*
become
in
the
conversation
,
said
to
him
,
in
a
low
tone
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
gentleman
--
Ivan
Petrovitch
--
is
a
relation
of
your
late
friend
,
Mr.
*NL*
Pavlicheff
.
You
wanted
to
find
some
of
his
relations
,
did
you
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
general
,
who
had
been
talking
to
his
chief
up
to
this
moment
,
had
*NL*
observed
the
prince
's
solitude
and
silence
,
and
was
anxious
to
draw
him
*NL*
into
the
conversation
,
and
so
introduce
him
again
to
the
notice
of
some
*NL*
of
the
important
personages
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lef
Nicolaievitch
was
a
ward
of
Nicolai
Andreevitch
Pavlicheff
,
after
*NL*
the
death
of
his
own
parents
,
''
he
remarked
,
meeting
Ivan
Petrovitch
's
*NL*
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
happy
to
meet
him
,
I
'm
sure
,
''
remarked
the
latter
.
``
I
remember
*NL*
Lef
Nicolaievitch
well
.
When
General
Epanchin
introduced
us
just
now
,
*NL*
I
recognized
you
at
once
,
prince
.
You
are
very
little
changed
,
though
*NL*
I
saw
you
last
as
a
child
of
some
ten
or
eleven
years
old
.
There
was
*NL*
something
in
your
features
,
I
suppose
,
that
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
saw
me
as
a
child
!
''
exclaimed
the
prince
,
with
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
yes
,
long
ago
,
''
continued
Ivan
Petrovitch
,
``
while
you
were
living
*NL*
with
my
cousin
at
Zlatoverhoff
.
You
do
n't
remember
me
?
No
,
I
dare
*NL*
say
you
do
n't
;
you
had
some
malady
at
the
time
,
I
remember
.
It
was
so
*NL*
serious
that
I
was
surprised
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
remember
nothing
!
''
said
the
prince
.
A
few
more
words
of
*NL*
explanation
followed
,
words
which
were
spoken
without
the
smallest
*NL*
excitement
by
his
companion
,
but
which
evoked
the
greatest
agitation
in
*NL*
the
prince
;
and
it
was
discovered
that
two
old
ladies
to
whose
care
the
*NL*
prince
had
been
left
by
Pavlicheff
,
and
who
lived
at
Zlatoverhoff
,
were
*NL*
also
relations
of
Ivan
Petrovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
had
no
idea
and
could
give
no
information
as
to
why
*NL*
Pavlicheff
had
taken
so
great
an
interest
in
the
little
prince
,
his
*NL*
ward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
point
of
fact
I
do
n't
think
I
thought
much
about
it
,
''
said
the
old
*NL*
fellow
.
He
seemed
to
have
a
wonderfully
good
memory
,
however
,
for
he
*NL*
told
the
prince
all
about
the
two
old
ladies
,
Pavlicheff
's
cousins
,
who
*NL*
had
taken
care
of
him
,
and
whom
,
he
declared
,
he
had
taken
to
task
*NL*
for
being
too
severe
with
the
prince
as
a
small
sickly
boy
--
the
elder
*NL*
sister
,
at
least
;
the
younger
had
been
kind
,
he
recollected
.
They
*NL*
both
now
lived
in
another
province
,
on
a
small
estate
left
to
them
by
*NL*
Pavlicheff
.
The
prince
listened
to
all
this
with
eyes
sparkling
with
*NL*
emotion
and
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
declared
with
unusual
warmth
that
he
would
never
forgive
himself
for
*NL*
having
travelled
about
in
the
central
provinces
during
these
last
six
*NL*
months
without
having
hunted
up
his
two
old
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
declared
,
further
,
that
he
had
intended
to
go
every
day
,
but
had
*NL*
always
been
prevented
by
circumstances
;
but
that
now
he
would
promise
*NL*
himself
the
pleasure
--
however
far
it
was
,
he
would
find
them
out
.
And
so
*NL*
Ivan
Petrovitch
_
really
_
knew
Natalia
Nikitishna
!
--
what
a
saintly
nature
*NL*
was
hers
!
--
and
Martha
Nikitishna
!
Ivan
Petrovitch
must
excuse
him
,
*NL*
but
really
he
was
not
quite
fair
on
dear
old
Martha
.
She
was
severe
,
*NL*
perhaps
;
but
then
what
else
could
she
be
with
such
a
little
idiot
as
he
*NL*
was
then
?
-LRB-
Ha
,
ha
.
-RRB-
He
really
was
an
idiot
then
,
Ivan
Petrovitch
must
*NL*
know
,
though
he
might
not
believe
it
.
-LRB-
Ha
,
ha
.
-RRB-
So
he
had
really
seen
*NL*
him
there
!
Good
heavens
!
And
was
he
really
and
truly
and
actually
a
*NL*
cousin
of
Pavlicheff
's
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
assure
you
of
it
,
''
laughed
Ivan
Petrovitch
,
gazing
amusedly
at
the
*NL*
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
I
did
n't
say
it
because
I
_
doubt
_
the
fact
,
you
know
.
-LRB-
Ha
,
ha
.
-RRB-
*NL*
How
could
I
doubt
such
a
thing
?
-LRB-
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
.
-RRB-
I
made
the
remark
*NL*
because
--
because
Nicolai
Andreevitch
Pavlicheff
was
such
a
splendid
man
,
*NL*
do
n't
you
see
!
Such
a
high-souled
man
,
he
really
was
,
I
assure
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
did
not
exactly
pant
for
breath
,
but
he
``
seemed
almost
*NL*
to
_
choke
_
out
of
pure
simplicity
and
goodness
of
heart
,
''
as
Adelaida
*NL*
expressed
it
,
on
talking
the
party
over
with
her
fiance
,
the
Prince
S.
,
*NL*
next
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
my
goodness
me
,
''
laughed
Ivan
Petrovitch
,
``
why
ca
n't
I
be
cousin
*NL*
to
even
a
splendid
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dear
!
''
cried
the
prince
,
confused
,
trying
to
hurry
his
words
*NL*
out
,
and
growing
more
and
more
eager
every
moment
:
``
I
've
gone
and
said
*NL*
another
stupid
thing
.
I
do
n't
know
what
to
say
.
I
--
I
did
n't
mean
that
,
*NL*
you
know
--
I
--
I
--
he
really
was
such
a
splendid
man
,
was
n't
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
trembled
all
over
.
Why
was
he
so
agitated
?
Why
had
he
flown
*NL*
into
such
transports
of
delight
without
any
apparent
reason
?
He
had
far
*NL*
outshot
the
measure
of
joy
and
emotion
consistent
with
the
occasion
.
Why
*NL*
this
was
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
seemed
to
feel
warmly
and
deeply
grateful
to
someone
for
something
or
*NL*
other
--
perhaps
to
Ivan
Petrovitch
;
but
likely
enough
to
all
the
guests
,
*NL*
individually
,
and
collectively
.
He
was
much
too
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ivan
Petrovitch
began
to
stare
at
him
with
some
surprise
;
the
dignitary
,
*NL*
too
,
looked
at
him
with
considerable
attention
;
Princess
Bielokonski
*NL*
glared
at
him
angrily
,
and
compressed
her
lips
.
Prince
N.
,
Evgenie
,
*NL*
Prince
S.
,
and
the
girls
,
all
broke
off
their
own
conversations
and
*NL*
listened
.
Aglaya
seemed
a
little
startled
;
as
for
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
,
*NL*
her
heart
sank
within
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
odd
of
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
and
her
daughters
.
They
had
*NL*
themselves
decided
that
it
would
be
better
if
the
prince
did
not
talk
*NL*
all
the
evening
.
Yet
seeing
him
sitting
silent
and
alone
,
but
perfectly
*NL*
happy
,
they
had
been
on
the
point
of
exerting
themselves
to
draw
him
*NL*
into
one
of
the
groups
of
talkers
around
the
room
.
Now
that
he
was
in
*NL*
the
midst
of
a
talk
they
became
more
than
ever
anxious
and
perturbed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
he
was
a
splendid
man
is
perfectly
true
;
you
are
quite
right
,
''
*NL*
repeated
Ivan
Petrovitch
,
but
seriously
this
time
.
``
He
was
a
fine
and
a
*NL*
worthy
fellow
--
worthy
,
one
may
say
,
of
the
highest
respect
,
''
he
added
,
*NL*
more
and
more
seriously
at
each
pause
;
``
and
it
is
agreeable
to
see
,
on
*NL*
your
part
,
such

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
n't
it
this
same
Pavlicheff
about
whom
there
was
a
strange
story
in
*NL*
connection
with
some
abbot
?
I
do
n't
remember
who
the
abbot
was
,
but
I
*NL*
remember
at
one
time
everybody
was
talking
about
it
,

remarked
the
old
*NL*
dignitary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
Abbot
Gurot
,
a
Jesuit
,
''
said
Ivan
Petrovitch
.
``
Yes
,
that
's
the
*NL*
sort
of
thing
our
best
men
are
apt
to
do
.
A
man
of
rank
,
too
,
and
*NL*
rich
--
a
man
who
,
if
he
had
continued
to
serve
,
might
have
done
anything
;
*NL*
and
then
to
throw
up
the
service
and
everything
else
in
order
to
go
over
*NL*
to
Roman
Catholicism
and
turn
Jesuit
--
openly
,
too
--
almost
triumphantly
.
*NL*
By
Jove
!
it
was
positively
a
mercy
that
he
died
when
he
did
--
it
was
*NL*
indeed
--
everyone
said
so
at
the
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
was
beside
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pavlicheff
?
--
Pavlicheff
turned
Roman
Catholic
?
Impossible
!
''
he
cried
,
*NL*
in
horror
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
H
'm
!
impossible
is
rather
a
strong
word
,
''
said
Ivan
Petrovitch
.
``
You
*NL*
must
allow
,
my
dear
prince
...
However
,
of
course
you
value
the
memory
of
*NL*
the
deceased
so
very
highly
;
and
he
certainly
was
the
kindest
of
men
;
*NL*
to
which
fact
,
by
the
way
,
I
ascribe
,
more
than
to
anything
else
,
the
*NL*
success
of
the
abbot
in
influencing
his
religious
convictions
.
But
you
*NL*
may
ask
me
,
if
you
please
,
how
much
trouble
and
worry
I
,
personally
,
*NL*
had
over
that
business
,
and
especially
with
this
same
Gurot
!
Would
you
*NL*
believe
it
,
''
he
continued
,
addressing
the
dignitary
,
``
they
actually
*NL*
tried
to
put
in
a
claim
under
the
deceased

will
,
and
I
had
to
resort
*NL*
to
the
very
strongest
measures
in
order
to
bring
them
to
their
senses
?
*NL*
I
assure
you
they
knew
their
cue
,
did
these
gentlemen

wonderful
!
Thank
*NL*
goodness
all
this
was
in
Moscow
,
and
I
got
the
Court
,
you
know

to
help
*NL*
me

we
soon
brought
them
to
their
senses

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
n't
believe

you
have
pained

astonished
me

cried
the
*NL*
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
sorry
;

in

of
fact

you

it
was
all
nonsense

would
have
ended
in
smoke

as
usual

I
'm
sure
of
that

Last

he
*NL*
turned
to
the
old
man
again
,
--
``
Countess
K.
joined
some
Roman
Convent

abroad

Our

never

*NL*
``
That

all

replied
the
old
man

*NL*
with
authority
.
``
And
then
their

they

a
skilful

manner

doing
it

And
they
know
how
to
startle
one

too

I
got
quite
*NL*
a
fright
myself
in

32
,
in
Vienna
,
I
assure
you
;
but
I
did
n't
cave
in
to

them

I
ran
away
instead

*NL*
*NL*
``

always
heard

Countess
Levitsky

throwing
up
everything
in

to
do
*NL*
it

and
not
from
the
Jesuits
at
all

said
Princess
Bielokonski
,
*NL*
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
yes

but
we
call
it
from
the
Jesuits
,
you
know
;
it
comes
to
*NL*
the

thing

laughed
the
old
fellow
,
delighted
with
the
pleasant
*NL*
recollection
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
seem
to
be
very
religious

he
continued
,
kindly
,
addressing
the
*NL*
prince
,
``
which
is
a
thing
one
meets
so
seldom
nowadays

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
was
listening
open-mouthed
,
and
still
in
a
condition
of
*NL*
excited
agitation
.
The
old
man
was
evidently
interested
in
him
,
and
*NL*
anxious
to
study
him
more
closely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pavlicheff
was
a
man
of
bright
intellect
and
a
good
Christian
,
a
*NL*
sincere
Christian
,
''
said
the
prince
,
suddenly
.
``
How
could
he
possibly
*NL*
embrace
a
faith
which
is
unchristian
?
Roman
Catholicism
is
,
so
to
speak
,
*NL*
simply
the
same
thing
as
unchristianity
,
''
he
added
with
flashing
eyes
,
*NL*
which
seemed
to
take
in
everybody
in
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
that
's
a
little
_
too
_
strong
,
is
n't
it
?
''
murmured
the
old
man
,
*NL*
glancing
at
General
Epanchin
in
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
make
out
that
the
Roman
Catholic
religion
is
_
unchristian
?
_
*NL*
What
is
it
,
then
?
''
asked
Ivan
Petrovitch
,
turning
to
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
a
Christian
religion
,
in
the
first
place
,
''
said
the
latter
,
*NL*
in
extreme
agitation
,
quite
out
of
proportion
to
the
necessity
of
the
*NL*
moment
.
``
And
in
the
second
place
,
Roman
Catholicism
is
,
in
my
opinion
,
*NL*
worse
than
Atheism
itself
.
Yes
--
that
is
my
opinion
.
Atheism
only
*NL*
preaches
a
negation
,
but
Romanism
goes
further
;
it
preaches
a
*NL*
disfigured
,
distorted
Christ
--
it
preaches
Anti-Christ
--
I
assure
you
,
I
*NL*
swear
it
!
This
is
my
own
personal
conviction
,
and
it
has
long
distressed
*NL*
me
.
The
Roman
Catholic
believes
that
the
Church
on
earth
can
not
stand
*NL*
without
universal
temporal
Power
.
He
cries
`
non
possumus
!
'
In
my
*NL*
opinion
the
Roman
Catholic
religion
is
not
a
faith
at
all
,
but
simply
a
*NL*
continuation
of
the
Roman
Empire
,
and
everything
is
subordinated
to
*NL*
this
idea
--
beginning
with
faith
.
The
Pope
has
seized
territories
and
an
*NL*
earthly
throne
,
and
has
held
them
with
the
sword
.
And
so
the
thing
has
*NL*
gone
on
,
only
that
to
the
sword
they
have
added
lying
,
intrigue
,
deceit
,
*NL*
fanaticism
,
superstition
,
swindling
;
--
they
have
played
fast
and
loose
*NL*
with
the
most
sacred
and
sincere
feelings
of
men
;
--
they
have
exchanged
*NL*
everything
--
everything
for
money
,
for
base
earthly
_
power
!
_
And
is
this
*NL*
not
the
teaching
of
Anti-Christ
?
How
could
the
upshot
of
all
this
*NL*
be
other
than
Atheism
?
Atheism
is
the
child
of
Roman
Catholicism
--
it
*NL*
proceeded
from
these
Romans
themselves
,
though
perhaps
they
would
not
*NL*
believe
it
.
It
grew
and
fattened
on
hatred
of
its
parents
;
it
is
the
*NL*
progeny
of
their
lies
and
spiritual
feebleness
.
Atheism
!
In
our
country
*NL*
it
is
only
among
the
upper
classes
that
you
find
unbelievers
;
men
who
*NL*
have
lost
the
root
or
spirit
of
their
faith
;
but
abroad
whole
masses
of
*NL*
the
people
are
beginning
to
profess
unbelief
--
at
first
because
of
*NL*
the
darkness
and
lies
by
which
they
were
surrounded
;
but
now
out
of
*NL*
fanaticism
,
out
of
loathing
for
the
Church
and
Christianity
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
paused
to
get
breath
.
He
had
spoken
with
extraordinary
*NL*
rapidity
,
and
was
very
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
present
interchanged
glances
,
but
at
last
the
old
dignitary
burst
*NL*
out
laughing
frankly
.
Prince
N.
took
out
his
eye-glass
to
have
a
good
*NL*
look
at
the
speaker
.
The
German
poet
came
out
of
his
corner
and
crept
*NL*
nearer
to
the
table
,
with
a
spiteful
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
exaggerate
the
matter
very
much
,
''
said
Ivan
Petrovitch
,
with
rather
*NL*
a
bored
air
.
``
There
are
,
in
the
foreign
Churches

many
representatives

of

are
worthy
of
respect

esteem
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
I
did
not
speak
of
individual
representatives

I
was
merely
*NL*
talking
about
Roman
Catholicism

and
its
essence
--
of
Rome
itself
.
A
*NL*
Church
can
never
entirely
disappear
;
I
never
hinted
at
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Agreed
that
all
this
may
be
true
;
but
we
need
not
discuss
a
subject

domain
of
theology

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

no

oh

no

Not
to
theology
alone

I
assure
you
!
Why

Socialism
is
*NL*
the
progeny
of
Romanism
and
of
the
Romanistic
spirit
.
It
and
its
brother
*NL*
Atheism
proceed
from
Despair
in
opposition
to
Catholicism
.
It
seeks
to
*NL*
replace
in
itself
the
moral
power
of
religion
,
in
order
to
appease
the
*NL*
spiritual
thirst
of
parched
humanity
and
save
it
;
not
by
Christ
,
but
*NL*
by
force

`
Do

not

this
is
harmless

without
danger

ourselves

Oh

no

``

cried
Ivan

considerably
*NL*
disturbed

looking
around
uneasily

The
prince
was
silent
.
He
sat
straight
up
in
his
chair
and
gazed
*NL*
fervently
at
Ivan
Petrovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
to
me
that
you
have
been
too
painfully
impressed

benefactor

said
the
old
dignitary
,
*NL*
kindly
,
and
with
the
utmost
calmness
of
demeanour

``
You
are
excitable

*NL*
perhaps
as
the
result

your
solitary
life

*NL*
mind
to
live
more
among
your

I
trust

I
am
sure
,
*NL*
that
the
world
would
be
glad
to
welcome

as
a
remarkable
young
man
;
*NL*
and
you
would
soon
find
yourself
able
to
look
at
things
more
calmly
.
You
*NL*
would
see
that
all
these
things
are
much
simpler
than
you
think
;
and
,
*NL*
besides
,
these
rare
cases
come
about
,
in
my
opinion
,
from
ennui
and
from
*NL*
satiety

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
,
exactly
!
That
is
a
true
thought
!
''
cried
the
prince
.
``
From
*NL*
ennui

from
our
ennui

not
from
satiety

Oh
,
no
,
you
are
wrong
there
!
*NL*
Say
from
_
thirst
_
if
you
like
;
the
thirst
of
fever
!
And
please
do
not
*NL*
suppose
that
this
is
so
small
a
matter
that
we
may
have
a
laugh
at
it
*NL*
and
dismiss
it
;
we
must
be
able
to
foresee
our
disasters
and
arm
against
*NL*
them
.
We
Russians
no
sooner
arrive
at
the
brink
of
the
water
,
and
*NL*
realize
that
we
are
really
at
the
brink
,
than
we
are
so
delighted
with
*NL*
the
outlook
that
in
we
plunge
and
swim
to
the
farthest
point
we
can
*NL*
see
.
Why
is
this
?
You
say
you
are
surprised
at
Pavlicheff
's
action
;
you
*NL*
ascribe
it
to
madness
,
to
kindness
of
heart
,
and
what
not
,
but
it
is
not
*NL*
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
Russian
intensity
not
only
astonishes
ourselves
;
all
Europe
wonders
*NL*
at
our
conduct
in
such
cases
!
For
,
if
one
of
us
goes
over
to
Roman
*NL*
Catholicism
,
he
is
sure
to
become
a
Jesuit
at
once
,
and
a
rabid
one
into
*NL*
the
bargain
.
If
one
of
us
becomes
an
Atheist
,
he
must
needs
begin
to
*NL*
insist
on
the
prohibition
of
faith
in
God
by
force
,
that
is
,
by
the
*NL*
sword
.
Why
is
this
?
Why
does
he
then
exceed
all
bounds
at
once
?
Because
*NL*
he
has
found
land
at
last
,
the
fatherland
that
he
sought
in
vain
before
;
*NL*
and
,
because
his
soul
is
rejoiced
to
find
it
,
he
throws
himself
upon
it
*NL*
and
kisses
it
!
Oh
,
it
is
not
from
vanity
alone
,
it
is
not
from
feelings
*NL*
of
vanity
that
Russians
become
Atheists
and
Jesuits
!
But
from
spiritual
*NL*
thirst
,
from
anguish
of
longing
for
higher
things
,
for
dry
firm
land
,
*NL*
for
foothold
on
a
fatherland
which
they
never
believed
in
because
they
*NL*
never
knew
it
.
It
is
easier
for
a
Russian
to
become
an
Atheist
,
than
for
*NL*
any
other
nationality
in
the
world
.
And
not
only
does
a
Russian
`
become
*NL*
an
Atheist
,
'
but
he
actually
_
believes
in
_
Atheism
,
just
as
though
he
*NL*
had
found
a
new
faith
,
not
perceiving
that
he
has
pinned
his
faith
to
*NL*
a
negation
.
Such
is
our
anguish
of
thirst
!
`
Whoso
has
no
country
has
no
*NL*
God
.
'
That
is
not
my
own
expression
;
it
is
the
expression
of
a
merchant
,
*NL*
one
of
the
Old
Believers
,
whom
I
once
met
while
travelling
.
He
did
not
*NL*
say
exactly
these
words
.
I
think
his
expression
was
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Whoso
forsakes
his
country
forsakes
his
God
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
let
these
thirsty
Russian
souls
find
,
like
Columbus
'
discoverers
,
a
*NL*
new
world
;
let
them
find
the
Russian
world
,
let
them
search
and
discover
*NL*
all
the
gold
and
treasure
that
lies
hid
in
the
bosom
of
their
own
land
!
*NL*
Show
them
the
restitution
of
lost
humanity
,
in
the
future
,
by
Russian
*NL*
thought
alone
,
and
by
means
of
the
God
and
of
the
Christ
of
our
Russian
*NL*
faith
,
and
you
will
see
how
mighty
and
just
and
wise
and
good
a
giant
*NL*
will
rise
up
before
the
eyes
of
the
astonished
and
frightened
world
;
*NL*
astonished
because
they
expect
nothing
but
the
sword
from
us
,
because
*NL*
they
think
they
will
get
nothing
out
of
us
but
barbarism
.
This
has
*NL*
been
the
case
up
to
now
,
and
the
longer
matters
go
on
as
they
are
now
*NL*
proceeding
,
the
more
clear
will
be
the
truth
of
what
I
say
;
and
I
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
this
moment
something
happened
which
put
a
most
unexpected
end
to
*NL*
the
orator
's
speech
.
All
this
heated
tirade
,
this
outflow
of
passionate
*NL*
words
and
ecstatic
ideas
which
seemed
to
hustle
and
tumble
over
each
*NL*
other
as
they
fell
from
his
lips
,
bore
evidence
of
some
unusually
*NL*
disturbed
mental
condition
in
the
young
fellow
who
had
``
boiled
over
''
in
*NL*
such
a
remarkable
manner
,
without
any
apparent
reason
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
those
who
were
present
,
such
as
knew
the
prince
listened
to
his
*NL*
outburst
in
a
state
of
alarm
,
some
with
a
feeling
of
mortification
.
It
*NL*
was
so
unlike
his
usual
timid
self-constraint
;
so
inconsistent
with
his
*NL*
usual
taste
and
tact
,
and
with
his
instinctive
feeling
for
the
higher
*NL*
proprieties
.
They
could
not
understand
the
origin
of
the
outburst
;
it
*NL*
could
not
be
simply
the
news
of
Pavlicheff
's
perversion
.
By
the
ladies
*NL*
the
prince
was
regarded
as
little
better
than
a
lunatic
,
and
Princess
*NL*
Bielokonski
admitted
afterwards
that
``
in
another
minute
she
would
have
*NL*
bolted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
old
gentlemen
looked
quite
alarmed
.
The
old
general
-LRB-
Epanchin
's
*NL*
chief
-RRB-
sat
and
glared
at
the
prince
in
severe
displeasure
.
The
colonel
*NL*
sat
immovable
.
Even
the
German
poet
grew
a
little
pale
,
though
he
wore
*NL*
his
usual
artificial
smile
as
he
looked
around
to
see
what
the
others
*NL*
would
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
point
of
fact
it
is
quite
possible
that
the
matter
would
have
ended
*NL*
in
a
very
commonplace
and
natural
way
in
a
few
minutes
.
The
undoubtedly
*NL*
astonished
,
but
now
more
collected
,
General
Epanchin
had
several
times
*NL*
endeavoured
to
interrupt
the
prince
,
and
not
having
succeeded
he
was
now
*NL*
preparing
to
take
firmer
and
more
vigorous
measures
to
attain
his
end
.
*NL*
In
another
minute
or
two
he
would
probably
have
made
up
his
mind
to
lead
*NL*
the
prince
quietly
out
of
the
room
,
on
the
plea
of
his
being
ill
-LRB-
and
it
*NL*
was
more
than
likely
that
the
general
was
right
in
his
belief
that
the
*NL*
prince
_
was
_
actually
ill
-RRB-
,
but
it
so
happened
that
destiny
had
something
*NL*
different
in
store
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
beginning
of
the
evening
,
when
the
prince
first
came
into
the
*NL*
room
,
he
had
sat
down
as
far
as
possible
from
the
Chinese
vase
which
*NL*
Aglaya
had
spoken
of
the
day
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Will
it
be
believed
that
,
after
Aglaya
's
alarming
words
,
an
ineradicable
*NL*
conviction
had
taken
possession
of
his
mind
that
,
however
he
might
try
*NL*
to
avoid
this
vase
next
day
,
he
must
certainly
break
it
?
But
so
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
evening
other
impressions
began
to
awaken
in
his
mind
,
as
*NL*
we
have
seen
,
and
he
forgot
his
presentiment
.
But
when
Pavlicheff
was
*NL*
mentioned
and
the
general
introduced
him
to
Ivan
Petrovitch
,
he
had
*NL*
changed
his
place
,
and
went
over
nearer
to
the
table
;
when
,
it
so
*NL*
happened
,
he
took
the
chair
nearest
to
the
beautiful
vase
,
which
stood
*NL*
on
a
pedestal
behind
him
,
just
about
on
a
level
with
his
elbow
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
spoke
his
last
words
he
had
risen
suddenly
from
his
seat
with
a
*NL*
wave
of
his
arm
,
and
there
was
a
general
cry
of
horror
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
huge
vase
swayed
backwards
and
forwards
;
it
seemed
to
be
uncertain
*NL*
whether
or
no
to
topple
over
on
to
the
head
of
one
of
the
old
men
,
*NL*
but
eventually
determined
to
go
the
other
way
,
and
came
crashing
over
*NL*
towards
the
German
poet
,
who
darted
out
of
the
way
in
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
crash
,
the
cry
,
the
sight
of
the
fragments
of
valuable
china
*NL*
covering
the
carpet
,
the
alarm
of
the
company
--
what
all
this
meant
*NL*
to
the
poor
prince
it
would
be
difficult
to
convey
to
the
mind
of
the
*NL*
reader
,
or
for
him
to
imagine
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
one
very
curious
fact
was
that
all
the
shame
and
vexation
and
*NL*
mortification
which
he
felt
over
the
accident
were
less
powerful
than
*NL*
the
deep
impression
of
the
almost
supernatural
truth
of
his
premonition
.
*NL*
He
stood
still
in
alarm
--
in
almost
superstitious
alarm
,
for
a
moment
;
*NL*
then
all
mists
seemed
to
clear
away
from
his
eyes
;
he
was
conscious
of
*NL*
nothing
but
light
and
joy
and
ecstasy
;
his
breath
came
and
went
;
but
*NL*
the
moment
passed
.
Thank
God
it
was
not
that
!
He
drew
a
long
breath
and
*NL*
looked
around
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
some
minutes
he
did
not
seem
to
comprehend
the
excitement
around
*NL*
him
;
that
is
,
he
comprehended
it
and
saw
everything
,
but
he
stood
aside
,
*NL*
as
it
were
,
like
someone
invisible
in
a
fairy
tale
,
as
though
he
had
*NL*
nothing
to
do
with
what
was
going
on
,
though
it
pleased
him
to
take
an
*NL*
interest
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
saw
them
gather
up
the
broken
bits
of
china
;
he
heard
the
loud
*NL*
talking
of
the
guests
and
observed
how
pale
Aglaya
looked
,
and
how
very
*NL*
strangely
she
was
gazing
at
him
.
There
was
no
hatred
in
her
expression
,
*NL*
and
no
anger
whatever
.
It
was
full
of
alarm
for
him
,
and
sympathy
and
*NL*
affection
,
while
she
looked
around
at
the
others
with
flashing
,
angry
*NL*
eyes
.
His
heart
filled
with
a
sweet
pain
as
he
gazed
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
he
observed
,
to
his
amazement
,
that
all
had
taken
their
seats
*NL*
again
,
and
were
laughing
and
talking
as
though
nothing
had
happened
.
*NL*
Another
minute
and
the
laughter
grew
louder
--
they
were
laughing
at
him
,
*NL*
at
his
dumb
stupor
--
laughing
kindly
and
merrily
.
Several
of
them
*NL*
spoke
to
him
,
and
spoke
so
kindly
and
cordially
,
especially
Lizabetha
*NL*
Prokofievna
--
she
was
saying
the
kindest
possible
things
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
he
became
aware
that
General
Epanchin
was
tapping
him
on
the
*NL*
shoulder
;
Ivan
Petrovitch
was
laughing
too
,
but
still
more
kind
and
*NL*
sympathizing
was
the
old
dignitary
.
He
took
the
prince
by
the
hand
and
*NL*
pressed
it
warmly
;
then
he
patted
it
,
and
quietly
urged
him
to
recollect
*NL*
himself
--
speaking
to
him
exactly
as
he
would
have
spoken
to
a
little
*NL*
frightened
child
,
which
pleased
the
prince
wonderfully
;
and
next
seated
*NL*
him
beside
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
gazed
into
his
face
with
pleasure
,
but
still
seemed
to
have
*NL*
no
power
to
speak
.
His
breath
failed
him
.
The
old
man
's
face
pleased
him
*NL*
greatly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
really
forgive
me
?
''
he
said
at
last
.
``
And
--
and
Lizabetha
*NL*
Prokofievna
too
?
''
The
laugh
increased
,
tears
came
into
the
prince
's
*NL*
eyes
,
he
could
not
believe
in
all
this
kindness
--
he
was
enchanted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
vase
certainly
was
a
very
beautiful
one
.
I
remember
it
here
for
*NL*
fifteen
years
--
yes
,
quite
that
!
''
remarked
Ivan
Petrovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
what
a
dreadful
calamity
!
A
wretched
vase
smashed
,
and
a
man
half
*NL*
dead
with
remorse
about
it
,
''
said
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
,
loudly
.
``
What
*NL*
made
you
so
dreadfully
startled
,
Lef
Nicolaievitch
?
''
she
added
,
a
little
*NL*
timidly
.
``
Come
,
my
dear
boy
!
cheer
up
.
You
really
alarm
me
,
taking
the
*NL*
accident
so
to
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
forgive
me
all
--
_
all
_
,
besides
the
vase
,
I
mean
?
''
said
the
prince
,
*NL*
rising
from
his
seat
once
more
,
but
the
old
gentleman
caught
his
hand
*NL*
and
drew
him
down
again
--
he
seemed
unwilling
to
let
him
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
C'est
tres-curieux
et
c'est
tres-serieux
_
,
''
he
whispered
across
the
*NL*
table
to
Ivan
Petrovitch
,
rather
loudly
.
Probably
the
prince
heard
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
that
I
have
not
offended
any
of
you
?
You
will
not
believe
how
happy
*NL*
I
am
to
be
able
to
think
so
.
It
is
as
it
should
be
.
As
if
I
_
could
_
offend
*NL*
anyone
here
!
I
should
offend
you
again
by
even
suggesting
such
a
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Calm
yourself
,
my
dear
fellow
.
You
are
exaggerating
again
;
you
really
*NL*
have
no
occasion
to
be
so
grateful
to
us
.
It
is
a
feeling
which
does
you
*NL*
great
credit
,
but
an
exaggeration
,
for
all
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
exactly
thanking
you
,
I
am
only
feeling
a
growing
admiration
*NL*
for
you
--
it
makes
me
happy
to
look
at
you
.
I
dare
say
I
am
speaking
very
*NL*
foolishly
,
but
I
must
speak
--
I
must
explain
,
if
it
be
out
of
nothing
*NL*
better
than
self-respect
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
he
said
and
did
was
abrupt
,
confused
,
feverish
--
very
likely
the
*NL*
words
he
spoke
,
as
often
as
not
,
were
not
those
he
wished
to
say
.
He
*NL*
seemed
to
inquire
whether
he
_
might
_
speak
.
His
eyes
lighted
on
Princess
*NL*
Bielokonski
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
my
friend
,
talk
away
,
talk
away
!
''
she
remarked
.
``
Only
do
n't
*NL*
lose
your
breath
;
you
were
in
such
a
hurry
when
you
began
,
and
look
what
*NL*
you
've
come
to
now
!
Do
n't
be
afraid
of
speaking
--
all
these
ladies
*NL*
and
gentlemen
have
seen
far
stranger
people
than
yourself
;
you
do
n't
*NL*
astonish
_
them
_
.
You
are
nothing
out-of-the-way
remarkable
,
you
know
.
*NL*
You
've
done
nothing
but
break
a
vase
,
and
give
us
all
a
fright

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
listened
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
n't
it
you
,
''
he
said
,
suddenly
turning
to
the
old
gentleman
,
``
who
*NL*
saved
the
student
Porkunoff
and
a
clerk
called
Shoabrin
from
being
sent
*NL*
to
Siberia
,
two
or
three
months
since
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
dignitary
blushed
a
little
,
and
murmured
that
the
prince
had
*NL*
better
not
excite
himself
further
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
have
heard
of
_
you
_
,
''
continued
the
prince
,
addressing
Ivan
*NL*
Petrovitch
,
``
that
when
some
of
your
villagers
were
burned
out
you
gave
*NL*
them
wood
to
build
up
their
houses
again
,
though
they
were
no
longer
*NL*
your
serfs
and
had
behaved
badly
towards
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
come
,
come
!
You
are
exaggerating
,
''
said
Ivan
Petrovitch
,
beaming
*NL*
with
satisfaction
,
all
the
same
.
He
was
right
,
however
,
in
this
*NL*
instance
,
for
the
report
had
reached
the
prince
's
ears
in
an
incorrect
*NL*
form
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
,
princess
,
''
he
went
on
,
addressing
Princess
Bielokonski
,
``
was
*NL*
it
not
you
who
received
me
in
Moscow
,
six
months
since

as
kindly
as

though
I
had
been
your
own
son
,
in
response
to
a
letter
from
Lizabetha
*NL*
Prokofievna
;
and
gave
me
one
piece
of
advice
,
again
as
to
your
own
son
,
*NL*
which
I
shall
never
forget
?
Do
you
remember
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
making
such
a
fuss
about
?

said
the
old
lady
,
with
*NL*
annoyance
.
``
You
are
a
good
fellow
,
but
very
silly

One
gives
you
a
*NL*
halfpenny
,
and
you
are
as
grateful
as
though
one
had
saved
your
life
.
*NL*
You
think
this
is
praiseworthy
on
your
part
,
but
it
is
not
--
it
is
not
,
*NL*
indeed

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
seemed
to
be
very
angry
,
but
suddenly
burst
out
laughing
,
quite
*NL*
good-humouredly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
's
face
brightened
up
,
too
;
so
did
that
of
General
*NL*
Epanchin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
you
Lef
Nicolaievitch
was
a
man
--
a
man
--
if
only
he
would
not
*NL*
be
in
such
a
hurry
,
as
the
princess
remarked
,
''
said
the
latter
,
with
*NL*
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aglaya
alone
seemed
sad
and
depressed
;
her
face
was
flushed
,
perhaps
*NL*
with
indignation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
really
is
very
charming
,
''
whispered
the
old
dignitary
to
Ivan
*NL*
Petrovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
came
into
this
room
with
anguish
in
my
heart
,
''
continued
the
prince
,
*NL*
with
ever-growing
agitation
,
speaking
quicker
and
quicker
,
and
with
*NL*
increasing
strangeness
.
``
I
--
I
was
afraid
of
you
all
,
and
afraid
of
*NL*
myself
.
I
was
most
afraid
of
myself
.
When
I
returned
to
Petersburg
,
I
*NL*
promised
myself
to
make
a
point
of
seeing
our
greatest
men
,
and
members
*NL*
of
our
oldest
families
--
the
old
families
like
my
own
.
I
am
now
among
*NL*
princes
like
myself
,
am
I
not
?
I
wished
to
know
you
,
and
it
was
*NL*
necessary
,
very
,
very
necessary
.
I
had
always
heard
so
much
that
was
*NL*
evil
said
of
you
all
--
more
evil
than
good
;
as
to
how
small
and
petty
*NL*
were
your
interests
,
how
absurd
your
habits
,
how
shallow
your
education
,
*NL*
and
so
on
.
There
is
so
much
written
and
said
about
you
!
I
came
here
*NL*
today
with
anxious
curiosity
;
I
wished
to
see
for
myself
and
form
my
*NL*
own
convictions
as
to
whether
it
were
true
that
the
whole
of
this
upper
*NL*
stratum
of
Russian
society
is
_
worthless
_
,
has
outlived
its
time
,
has
*NL*
existed
too
long
,
and
is
only
fit
to
die
--
and
yet
is
dying
with
petty
,
*NL*
spiteful
warring
against
that
which
is
destined
to
supersede
it
and
take
*NL*
its
place
--
hindering
the
Coming
Men
,
and
knowing
not
that
itself
is
in
*NL*
a
dying
condition
.
I
did
not
fully
believe
in
this
view
even
before
,
for
*NL*
there
never
was
such
a
class
among
us
--
excepting
perhaps
at
court
,
by
*NL*
accident
--
or
by
uniform
;
but
now
there
is
not
even
that
,
is
there
?
It
*NL*
has
vanished
,
has
it
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
not
a
bit
of
it
,
''
said
Ivan
Petrovitch
,
with
a
sarcastic
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
Lord
,
he
's
off
again
!
''
said
Princess
Bielokonski
,
impatiently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Laissez-le
dire
!
He
is
trembling
all
over
,
''
said
the
old
man
,
in
a
*NL*
warning
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
certainly
was
beside
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
What
have
I
seen
?
''
he
continued
.
``
I
have
seen
men
of
graceful
*NL*
simplicity
of
intellect
;
I
have
seen
an
old
man
who
is
not
above
*NL*
speaking
kindly
and
even
_
listening
_
to
a
boy
like
myself
;
I
see
before
*NL*
me
persons
who
can
understand
,
who
can
forgive
--
kind
,
good
Russian
*NL*
hearts
--
hearts
almost
as
kind
and
cordial
as
I
met
abroad
.
Imagine
how
*NL*
delighted
I
must
have
been
,
and
how
surprised
!
Oh
,
let
me
express
*NL*
this
feeling
!
I
have
so
often
heard
,
and
I
have
even
believed
,
that
*NL*
in
society
there
was
nothing
but
empty
forms
,
and
that
reality
had
*NL*
vanished
;
but
I
now
see
for
myself
that
this
can
never
be
the
case
_
here
_
,
*NL*
among
us
--
it
may
be
the
order
elsewhere
,
but
not
in
Russia
.
Surely
you
*NL*
are
not
all
Jesuits
and
deceivers
!
I
heard
Prince
N.
's
story
just
now
.
*NL*
Was
it
not
simple-minded
,
spontaneous
humour
?
Could
such
words
come
from
*NL*
the
lips
of
a
man
who
is
dead
?
--
a
man
whose
heart
and
talents
are
dried
*NL*
up
?
Could
dead
men
and
women
have
treated
me
so
kindly
as
you
have
all
*NL*
been
treating
me
to-day
?
Is
there
not
material
for
the
future
in
all
*NL*
this
--
for
hope
?
Can
such
people
fail
to
_
understand
?
_
Can
such
men
fall
*NL*
away
from
reality
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Once
more
let
us
beg
you
to
be
calm
,
my
dear
boy
.
We
'll
talk
of
all
*NL*
this
another
time
--
I
shall
do
so
with
the
greatest
pleasure
,
for
one
,
''
*NL*
said
the
old
dignitary
,
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ivan
Petrovitch
grunted
and
twisted
round
in
his
chair
.
General
Epanchin
*NL*
moved
nervously
.
The
latter
's
chief
had
started
a
conversation
with
the
*NL*
wife
of
the
dignitary
,
and
took
no
notice
whatever
of
the
prince
,
but
*NL*
the
old
lady
very
often
glanced
at
him
,
and
listened
to
what
he
was
*NL*
saying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
had
better
speak
,
''
continued
the
prince
,
with
a
new
outburst
*NL*
of
feverish
emotion
,
and
turning
towards
the
old
man
with
an
air
of
*NL*
confidential
trustfulness
.
``
Yesterday
,
Aglaya
Ivanovna
forbade
me
*NL*
to
talk
,
and
even
specified
the
particular
subjects
I
must
not
touch
*NL*
upon
--
she
knows
well
enough
that
I
am
odd
when
I
get
upon
these
matters
.
*NL*
I
am
nearly
twenty-seven
years
old
,
and
yet
I
know
I
am
little
better
*NL*
than
a
child
.
I
have
no
right
to
express
my
ideas
,
and
said
so
long
ago
.
*NL*
Only
in
Moscow
,
with
Rogojin
,
did
I
ever
speak
absolutely
freely
!
He
and
*NL*
I
read
Pushkin
together
--
all
his
works
.
Rogojin
knew
nothing
of
Pushkin
,
*NL*
had
not
even
heard
his
name
.
I
am
always
afraid
of
spoiling
a
great
*NL*
Thought
or
Idea
by
my
absurd
manner
.
I
have
no
eloquence
,
I
know
.
I
*NL*
always
make
the
wrong
gestures
--
inappropriate
gestures
--
and
therefore
*NL*
I
degrade
the
Thought
,
and
raise
a
laugh
instead
of
doing
my
subject
*NL*
justice
.
I
have
no
sense
of
proportion
either
,
and
that
is
the
chief
*NL*
thing
.
I
know
it
would
be
much
better
if
I
were
always
to
sit
still
and
*NL*
say
nothing
.
When
I
do
so
,
I
appear
to
be
quite
a
sensible
sort
of
a
*NL*
person
,
and
what
's
more
,
I
think
about
things
.
But
now
I
must
speak
;
it
*NL*
is
better
that
I
should
.
I
began
to
speak
because
you
looked
so
kindly
*NL*
at
me
;
you
have
such
a
beautiful
face
.
I
promised
Aglaya
Ivanovna
*NL*
yesterday
that
I
would
not
speak
all
the
evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
?
''
said
the
old
man
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
at
times
,
I
ca
n't
help
thinking
that
I
am
wrong
in
feeling
so
*NL*
about
it
,
you
know
.
Sincerity
is
more
important
than
elocution
,
is
n't
*NL*
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sometimes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
explain
all
to
you
--
everything
--
everything
!
I
know
you
think
*NL*
me
Utopian
,
do
n't
you
--
an
idealist
?
Oh
,
no
!
I
'm
not
,
indeed
--
my
ideas
*NL*
are
all
so
simple
.
You
do
n't
believe
me
?
You
are
smiling
.
Do
you
know
,
*NL*
I
am
sometimes
very
wicked
--
for
I
lose
my
faith
?
This
evening
as
I
came
*NL*
here
,
I
thought
to
myself
,
`
What
shall
I
talk
about
?
How
am
I
to
begin
,
*NL*
so
that
they
may
be
able
to
understand
partially
,
at
all
events
?
'
How
*NL*
afraid
I
was
--
dreadfully
afraid
!
And
yet
,
how
_
could
_
I
be
afraid
--
was
it
*NL*
not
shameful
of
me
?
Was
I
afraid
of
finding
a
bottomless
abyss
of
empty
*NL*
selfishness
?
Ah
!
that
's
why
I
am
so
happy
at
this
moment
,
because
I
find
*NL*
there
is
no
bottomless
abyss
at
all
--
but
good
,
healthy
material
,
full
of
*NL*
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
such
a
very
dreadful
circumstance
that
we
are
odd
people
,
is
*NL*
it
?
For
we
really
are
odd
,
you
know
--
careless
,
reckless
,
easily
wearied
*NL*
of
anything
.
We
do
n't
look
thoroughly
into
matters
--
do
n't
care
to
*NL*
understand
things
.
We
are
all
like
this
--
you
and
I
,
and
all
of
them
!
*NL*
Why
,
here
are
you
,
now
--
you
are
not
a
bit
angry
with
me
for
calling
you
*NL*
`
odd
,
'
are
you
?
And
,
if
so
,
surely
there
is
good
material
in
you
?
Do
you
*NL*
know
,
I
sometimes
think
it
is
a
good
thing
to
be
odd
.
We
can
forgive
*NL*
one
another
more
easily
,
and
be
more
humble
.
No
one
can
begin
by
being
*NL*
perfect
--
there
is
much
one
can
not
understand
in
life
at
first
.
In
order
*NL*
to
attain
to
perfection
,
one
must
begin
by
failing
to
understand
much
.
*NL*
And
if
we
take
in
knowledge
too
quickly
,
we
very
likely
are
not
taking
*NL*
it
in
at
all
.
I
say
all
this
to
you
--
you
who
by
this
time
understand
so
*NL*
much
--
and
doubtless
have
failed
to
understand
so
much
,
also
.
I
am
not
*NL*
afraid
of
you
any
longer
.
You
are
not
angry
that
a
mere
boy
should
say
*NL*
such
words
to
you
,
are
you
?
Of
course
not
!
You
know
how
to
forget
and
to
*NL*
forgive
.
You
are
laughing
,
Ivan
Petrovitch
?
You
think
I
am
a
champion
*NL*
of
other
classes
of
people
--
that
I
am
_
their
_
advocate
,
a
democrat
,
and
*NL*
an
orator
of
Equality
?
''
The
prince
laughed
hysterically
;
he
had
several
*NL*
times
burst
into
these
little
,
short
nervous
laughs
.
``
Oh
,
no
--
it
is
for
*NL*
you
,
for
myself
,
and
for
all
of
us
together
,
that
I
am
alarmed
.
I
am
a
*NL*
prince
of
an
old
family
myself
,
and
I
am
sitting
among
my
peers
;
and
I
*NL*
am
talking
like
this
in
the
hope
of
saving
us
all
;
in
the
hope
that
our
*NL*
class
will
not
disappear
altogether
--
into
the
darkness
--
unguessing
its
*NL*
danger
--
blaming
everything
around
it
,
and
losing
ground
every
day
.
Why
*NL*
should
we
disappear
and
give
place
to
others
,
when
we
may
still
,
if
*NL*
we
choose
,
remain
in
the
front
rank
and
lead
the
battle
?
Let
us
be
*NL*
servants
,
that
we
may
become
lords
in
due
season
!

*NL*
*NL*
He
tried
to
get
upon
his
feet
again
,
but
the
old
man
still
restrained
*NL*
him
,
gazing
at
him
with
increasing
perturbation
as
he
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
--
I
know
it
is
best
not
to
speak
!
It
is
best
simply
to
give
a
*NL*
good
example
--
simply
to
begin
the
work
.
I
have
done
this
--
I
have
*NL*
begun
,
and
--
and
--
oh
!
_
can
_
anyone
be
unhappy
,
really
?
Oh
!
what
does
grief
*NL*
matter
--
what
does
misfortune
matter
,
if
one
knows
how
to
be
happy
?
Do
*NL*
you
know
,
I
can
not
understand
how
anyone
can
pass
by
a
green
tree
,
and
*NL*
not
feel
happy
only
to
look
at
it
!
How
anyone
can
talk
to
a
man
and
not
*NL*
feel
happy
in
loving
him
!
Oh
,
it
is
my
own
fault
that
I
can
not
express
*NL*
myself
well
enough

But
there
are
lovely
things
at
every
step
I
*NL*
take

things
which
even
the
most
miserable
man
must
recognize
as
*NL*
beautiful
.
Look
at
a
little
child
--
look
at
God
's
day-dawn
--
look
at
the
*NL*
grass
growing
--
look
at
the
eyes
that
love
you
,
as
they
gaze
back
into
*NL*
your
eyes

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
risen
,
and
was
speaking
standing
up
.
The
old
gentleman
was
*NL*
looking
at
him
now
in
unconcealed
alarm
.
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
wrung
her
*NL*
hands
.
``
Oh
,
my
God
!
''
she
cried
.
She
had
guessed
the
state
of
the
case
*NL*
before
anyone
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aglaya
rushed
quickly
up
to
him
,
and
was
just
in
time
to
receive
him
in
*NL*
her
arms
,
and
to
hear
with
dread
and
horror
that
awful
,
wild
cry
as
he
*NL*
fell
writhing
to
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
he
lay
on
the
carpet
,
and
someone
quickly
placed
a
cushion
under
*NL*
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
had
expected
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
so
Prince
N.
and
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
and
the
*NL*
old
dignitary
were
hard
at
work
endeavouring
to
restore
the
harmony
*NL*
of
the
evening
,
but
it
was
of
no
avail
,
and
very
soon
after
the
guests
*NL*
separated
and
went
their
ways
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
great
deal
of
sympathy
was
expressed
;
a
considerable
amount
of
advice
*NL*
was
volunteered
;
Ivan
Petrovitch
expressed
his
opinion
that
the
young
*NL*
man
was
``
a
Slavophile
,
or
something
of
that
sort
''
;
but
that
it
was
not
a
*NL*
dangerous
development
.
The
old
dignitary
said
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
True
enough
,
most
of
the
guests
,
next
day
and
the
day
after
,
were
not
*NL*
in
very
good
humour
.
Ivan
Petrovitch
was
a
little
offended
,
but
not
*NL*
seriously
so
.
General
Epanchin
's
chief
was
rather
cool
towards
him
for
*NL*
some
while
after
the
occurrence
.
The
old
dignitary
,
as
patron
of
the
*NL*
family
,
took
the
opportunity
of
murmuring
some
kind
of
admonition
to
the
*NL*
general
,
and
added
,
in
flattering
terms
,
that
he
was
most
interested
*NL*
in
Aglaya
's
future
.
He
was
a
man
who
really
did
possess
a
kind
heart
,
*NL*
although
his
interest
in
the
prince
,
in
the
earlier
part
of
the
evening
,
*NL*
was
due
,
among
other
reasons
,
to
the
latter
's
connection
with
Nastasia
*NL*
Philipovna
,
according
to
popular
report
.
He
had
heard
a
good
deal
of
*NL*
this
story
here
and
there
,
and
was
greatly
interested
in
it
,
so
much
so
*NL*
that
he
longed
to
ask
further
questions
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Bielokonski
,
as
she
drove
away
on
this
eventful
evening
,
took
*NL*
occasion
to
say
to
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
he
's
a
good
match
--
and
a
bad
one
;
and
if
you
want
my
opinion
,
*NL*
more
bad
than
good
.
You
can
see
for
yourself
the
man
is
an
invalid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lizabetha
therefore
decided
that
the
prince
was
impossible
as
a
husband
*NL*
for
Aglaya
;
and
during
the
ensuing
night
she
made
a
vow
that
never
while
*NL*
she
lived
should
he
marry
Aglaya
.
With
this
resolve
firmly
impressed
*NL*
upon
her
mind
,
she
awoke
next
day
;
but
during
the
morning
,
after
her
*NL*
early
lunch
,
she
fell
into
a
condition
of
remarkable
inconsistency
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
reply
to
a
very
guarded
question
of
her
sisters
'
,
Aglaya
had
answered
*NL*
coldly
,
but
exceedingly
haughtily
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
never
given
him
my
word
at
all
,
nor
have
I
ever
counted
him
as
*NL*
my
future
husband
--
never
in
my
life
.
He
is
just
as
little
to
me
as
all
*NL*
the
rest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
suddenly
flared
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
expect
that
of
you
,
Aglaya
,
''
she
said
.
``
He
is
an
impossible
*NL*
husband
for
you
,
--
I
know
it
;
and
thank
God
that
we
agree
upon
that
*NL*
point
;
but
I
did
not
expect
to
hear
such
words
from
you
.
I
thought
I
*NL*
should
hear
a
very
different
tone
from
you
.
I
would
have
turned
out
*NL*
everyone
who
was
in
the
room
last
night
and
kept
him
,
--
that
's
the
sort
*NL*
of
man
he
is
,
in
my
opinion
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
she
suddenly
paused
,
afraid
of
what
she
had
just
said
.
But
she
*NL*
little
knew
how
unfair
she
was
to
her
daughter
at
that
moment
.
It
was
*NL*
all
settled
in
Aglaya
's
mind
.
She
was
only
waiting
for
the
hour
that
*NL*
would
bring
the
matter
to
a
final
climax
;
and
every
hint
,
every
careless
*NL*
probing
of
her
wound
,
did
but
further
lacerate
her
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
VIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
same
morning
dawned
for
the
prince
pregnant
with
no
less
painful
*NL*
presentiments
,
--
which
fact
his
physical
state
was
,
of
course
,
quite
*NL*
enough
to
account
for
;
but
he
was
so
indefinably
melancholy
,
--
his
*NL*
sadness
could
not
attach
itself
to
anything
in
particular
,
and
this
*NL*
tormented
him
more
than
anything
else
.
Of
course
certain
facts
stood
*NL*
before
him
,
clear
and
painful
,
but
his
sadness
went
beyond
all
that
he
*NL*
could
remember
or
imagine
;
he
realized
that
he
was
powerless
to
console
*NL*
himself
unaided
.
Little
by
little
he
began
to
develop
the
expectation
*NL*
that
this
day
something
important
,
something
decisive
,
was
to
happen
to
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
attack
of
yesterday
had
been
a
slight
one
.
Excepting
some
little
*NL*
heaviness
in
the
head
and
pain
in
the
limbs
,
he
did
not
feel
any
*NL*
particular
effects
.
His
brain
worked
all
right
,
though
his
soul
was
*NL*
heavy
within
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
rose
late
,
and
immediately
upon
waking
remembered
all
about
the
*NL*
previous
evening
;
he
also
remembered
,
though
not
quite
so
clearly
,
how
,
*NL*
half
an
hour
after
his
fit
,
he
had
been
carried
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
soon
heard
that
a
messenger
from
the
Epanchins
'
had
already
been
to
*NL*
inquire
after
him
.
At
half-past
eleven
another
arrived
;
and
this
pleased
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vera
Lebedeff
was
one
of
the
first
to
come
to
see
him
and
offer
her
*NL*
services
.
No
sooner
did
she
catch
sight
of
him
than
she
burst
into
*NL*
tears
;
but
when
he
tried
to
soothe
her
she
began
to
laugh
.
He
was
quite
*NL*
struck
by
the
girl
's
deep
sympathy
for
him
;
he
seized
her
hand
and
*NL*
kissed
it
.
Vera
flushed
crimson
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
n't
,
do
n't
!
''
she
exclaimed
in
alarm
,
snatching
her
hand
away
.
She
*NL*
went
hastily
out
of
the
room
in
a
state
of
strange
confusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lebedeff
also
came
to
see
the
prince
,
in
a
great
hurry
to
get
away
to
*NL*
the
``
deceased
,
''
as
he
called
General
Ivolgin
,
who
was
alive
still
,
but
*NL*
very
ill
.
Colia
also
turned
up
,
and
begged
the
prince
for
pity
's
sake
to
*NL*
tell
him
all
he
knew
about
his
father
which
had
been
concealed
from
him
*NL*
till
now
.
He
said
he
had
found
out
nearly
everything
since
yesterday
;
*NL*
the
poor
boy
was
in
a
state
of
deep
affliction
.
With
all
the
sympathy
*NL*
which
he
could
bring
into
play
,
the
prince
told
Colia
the
whole
story
*NL*
without
reserve
,
detailing
the
facts
as
clearly
as
he
could
.
The
*NL*
tale
struck
Colia
like
a
thunderbolt
.
He
could
not
speak
.
He
listened
*NL*
silently
,
and
cried
softly
to
himself
the
while
.
The
prince
perceived
*NL*
that
this
was
an
impression
which
would
last
for
the
whole
of
the
boy
's
*NL*
life
.
He
made
haste
to
explain
his
view
of
the
matter
,
and
pointed
out
*NL*
that
the
old
man
's
approaching
death
was
probably
brought
on
by
horror
*NL*
at
the
thought
of
his
action
;
and
that
it
was
not
everyone
who
was
*NL*
capable
of
such
a
feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Colia
's
eyes
flashed
as
he
listened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gania
and
Varia
and
Ptitsin
are
a
worthless
lot
!
I
shall
not
quarrel
*NL*
with
them
;
but
from
this
moment
our
feet
shall
not
travel
the
same
road
.
*NL*
Oh
,
prince
,
I
have
felt
much
that
is
quite
new
to
me
since
yesterday
!
*NL*
It
is
a
lesson
for
me
.
I
shall
now
consider
my
mother
as
entirely
my
*NL*
responsibility
;
though
she
may
be
safe
enough
with
Varia
.
Still
,
meat
*NL*
and
drink
is
not
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
jumped
up
and
hurried
off
,
remembering
suddenly
that
he
was
wanted
*NL*
at
his
father
's
bedside
;
but
before
he
went
out
of
the
room
he
inquired
*NL*
hastily
after
the
prince
's
health
,
and
receiving
the
latter
's
reply
,
*NL*
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
there
something
else
,
prince
?
I
heard
yesterday
,
but
I
have
*NL*
no
right
to
talk
about
this
...
If
you
ever
want
a
true
friend
and
*NL*
servant
--
neither
you
nor
I
are
so
very
happy
,
are
we
?
--
come
to
me
.
I
*NL*
wo
n't
ask
you
questions
,
though
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
ran
off
and
left
the
prince
more
dejected
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everyone
seemed
to
be
speaking
prophetically
,
hinting
at
some
misfortune
*NL*
or
sorrow
to
come
;
they
had
all
looked
at
him
as
though
they
knew
*NL*
something
which
he
did
not
know
.
Lebedeff
had
asked
questions
,
Colia
had
*NL*
hinted
,
and
Vera
had
shed
tears
.
What
was
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
with
a
sigh
of
annoyance
,
he
said
to
himself
that
it
was
*NL*
nothing
but
his
own
cursed
sickly
suspicion
.
His
face
lighted
up
with
*NL*
joy
when
,
at
about
two
o'clock
,
he
espied
the
Epanchins
coming
along
to
*NL*
pay
him
a
short
visit
,
``
just
for
a
minute
.
''
They
really
had
only
come
*NL*
for
a
minute
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
had
announced
,
directly
after
lunch
,
that
they
*NL*
would
all
take
a
walk
together
.
The
information
was
given
in
the
form
of
*NL*
a
command
,
without
explanation
,
drily
and
abruptly
.
All
had
issued
forth
*NL*
in
obedience
to
the
mandate
;
that
is
,
the
girls
,
mamma
,
and
Prince
S.
*NL*
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
went
off
in
a
direction
exactly
contrary
to
the
*NL*
usual
one
,
and
all
understood
very
well
what
she
was
driving
at
,
but
*NL*
held
their
peace
,
fearing
to
irritate
the
good
lady
.
She
,
as
though
*NL*
anxious
to
avoid
any
conversation
,
walked
ahead
,
silent
and
alone
.
At
*NL*
last
Adelaida
remarked
that
it
was
no
use
racing
along
at
such
a
pace
,
*NL*
and
that
she
could
not
keep
up
with
her
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
,
''
said
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
,
turning
round
suddenly
;
``
we
are
*NL*
passing
his
house
.
Whatever
Aglaya
may
think
,
and
in
spite
of
anything
*NL*
that
may
happen
,
he
is
not
a
stranger
to
us
;
besides
which
,
he
is
ill
*NL*
and
in
misfortune
.
I
,
for
one
,
shall
call
in
and
see
him
.
Let
anyone
*NL*
follow
me
who
cares
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
every
one
of
them
followed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
hastened
to
apologize
,
very
properly
,
for
yesterday
's
mishap
*NL*
with
the
vase
,
and
for
the
scene
generally
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
's
nothing
,
''
replied
Lizabetha
;
``
I
'm
not
sorry
for
the
vase
,
*NL*
I
'm
sorry
for
you
.
H
'm
!
so
you
can
see
that
there
was
a
`
scene
,
'
can
*NL*
you
?
Well
,
it
does
n't
matter
much
,
for
everyone
must
realize
now
that
it
*NL*
is
impossible
to
be
hard
on
you
.
Well
,
_
au
revoir
_
.
I
advise
you
to
have
*NL*
a
walk
,
and
then
go
to
sleep
again
if
you
can
.
Come
in
as
usual
,
if
*NL*
you
feel
inclined
;
and
be
assured
,
once
for
all
,
whatever
happens
,
and
*NL*
whatever
may
have
happened
,
you
shall
always
remain
the
friend
of
the
*NL*
family
--
mine
,
at
all
events
.
I
can
answer
for
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
response
to
this
challenge
all
the
others
chimed
in
and
re-echoed
*NL*
mamma
's
sentiments
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
they
took
their
departure
;
but
in
this
hasty
and
kindly
designed
*NL*
visit
there
was
hidden
a
fund
of
cruelty
which
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
*NL*
never
dreamed
of
.
In
the
words
``
as
usual
,
''
and
again
in
her
added
,
*NL*
``
mine
,
at
all
events
,
''
there
seemed
an
ominous
knell
of
some
evil
to
*NL*
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
began
to
think
of
Aglaya
.
She
had
certainly
given
him
a
*NL*
wonderful
smile
,
both
at
coming
and
again
at
leave-taking
,
but
had
not
*NL*
said
a
word
,
not
even
when
the
others
all
professed
their
friendship
for
*NL*
him
.
She
had
looked
very
intently
at
him
,
but
that
was
all
.
Her
face
had
*NL*
been
paler
than
usual
;
she
looked
as
though
she
had
slept
badly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
make
a
point
of
going
there
*NL*
``
as
usual
,
''
tonight
,
and
looked
feverishly
at
his
watch
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vera
came
in
three
minutes
after
the
Epanchins
had
left
.
``
Lef
*NL*
Nicolaievitch
,
''
she
said
,
``
Aglaya
Ivanovna
has
just
given
me
a
message
*NL*
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
trembled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
a
note
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
a
verbal
message
;
she
had
hardly
time
even
for
that
.
She
begs
you
*NL*
earnestly
not
to
go
out
of
the
house
for
a
single
moment
all
to-day
,
*NL*
until
seven
o'clock
in
the
evening
.
It
may
have
been
nine
;
I
did
n't
*NL*
quite
hear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
--
but
,
why
is
this
?
What
does
it
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
at
all
;
but
she
said
I
was
to
tell
you
particularly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
she
say
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
those
very
words
.
She
only
just
had
time
to
whisper
as
she
went
by
;
*NL*
but
by
the
way
she
looked
at
me
I
knew
it
was
important
.
She
looked
at
*NL*
me
in
a
way
that
made
my
heart
stop
beating
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
asked
a
few
more
questions
,
and
though
he
learned
nothing
*NL*
else
,
he
became
more
and
more
agitated
.
*NL*
*NL*
Left
alone
,
he
lay
down
on
the
sofa
,
and
began
to
think
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
,
''
he
thought
,
``
someone
is
to
be
with
them
until
nine
tonight
*NL*
and
she
is
afraid
that
I
may
come
and
make
a
fool
of
myself
again
,
in
*NL*
public
.
''
So
he
spent
his
time
longing
for
the
evening
and
looking
at
his
*NL*
watch
.
But
the
clearing-up
of
the
mystery
came
long
before
the
evening
,
*NL*
and
came
in
the
form
of
a
new
and
agonizing
riddle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Half
an
hour
after
the
Epanchins
had
gone
,
Hippolyte
arrived
,
so
tired
*NL*
that
,
almost
unconscious
,
he
sank
into
a
chair
,
and
broke
into
such
a
*NL*
fit
of
coughing
that
he
could
not
stop
.
He
coughed
till
the
blood
came
.
*NL*
His
eyes
glittered
,
and
two
red
spots
on
his
cheeks
grew
brighter
and
*NL*
brighter
.
The
prince
murmured
something
to
him
,
but
Hippolyte
only
*NL*
signed
that
he
must
be
left
alone
for
a
while
,
and
sat
silent
.
At
last
*NL*
he
came
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
off
,
''
he
said
,
hoarsely
,
and
with
difficulty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
see
you
home
?
''
asked
the
prince
,
rising
from
his
seat
,
but
*NL*
suddenly
stopping
short
as
he
remembered
Aglaya
's
prohibition
against
*NL*
leaving
the
house
.
Hippolyte
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
mean
that
I
am
going
to
leave
your
house
,
''
he
continued
,
*NL*
still
gasping
and
coughing
.
``
On
the
contrary
,
I
thought
it
absolutely
*NL*
necessary
to
come
and
see
you
;
otherwise
I
should
not
have
troubled
you
.
*NL*
I
am
off
there
,
you
know
,
and
this
time
I
believe
,
seriously
,
that
I
am
*NL*
off
!
It
's
all
over
.
I
did
not
come
here
for
sympathy
,
believe
me
.
I
lay
*NL*
down
this
morning
at
ten
o'clock
with
the
intention
of
not
rising
again
*NL*
before
that
time
;
but
I
thought
it
over
and
rose
just
once
more
in
*NL*
order
to
come
here
;
from
which
you
may
deduce
that
I
had
some
reason
for
*NL*
wishing
to
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
grieves
me
to
see
you
so
,
Hippolyte
.
Why
did
n't
you
send
me
a
*NL*
message
?
I
would
have
come
up
and
saved
you
this
trouble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
!
Enough
!
You
've
pitied
me
,
and
that
's
all
that
good
manners
*NL*
exact
.
I
forgot
,
how
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
all
right
;
yesterday
I
was
a
little

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
,
I
heard
;
the
china
vase
caught
it
!
I
'm
sorry
I
was
n't
there
.
*NL*
I
've
come
about
something
important
.
In
the
first
place
I
had
,
the
*NL*
pleasure
of
seeing
Gavrila
Ardalionovitch
and
Aglaya
Ivanovna
enjoying
a
*NL*
rendezvous
on
the
green
bench
in
the
park
.
I
was
astonished
to
see
what
*NL*
a
fool
a
man
can
look
.
I
remarked
upon
the
fact
to
Aglaya
Ivanovna
when
*NL*
he
had
gone
.
I
do
n't
think
anything
ever
surprises
you
,
prince
!
''
added
*NL*
Hippolyte
,
gazing
incredulously
at
the
prince
's
calm
demeanour
.
``
To
be
*NL*
astonished
by
nothing
is
a
sign
,
they
say
,
of
a
great
intellect
.
In
my
*NL*
opinion
it
would
serve
equally
well
as
a
sign
of
great
foolishness
.
I
*NL*
am
not
hinting
about
you
;
pardon
me
!
I
am
very
unfortunate
today
in
my
*NL*
expressions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
yesterday
that
Gavrila
Ardalionovitch
--
''
began
the
prince
,
and
*NL*
paused
in
evident
confusion
,
though
Hippolyte
had
shown
annoyance
at
his
*NL*
betraying
no
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
knew
it
?
Come
,
that
's
news
!
But
no
--
perhaps
better
not
tell
me
.
And
*NL*
were
you
a
witness
of
the
meeting
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
were
there
yourself
you
must
have
known
that
I
was
_
not
_
there
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
but
you
may
have
been
sitting
behind
the
bushes
somewhere
.
However
,
*NL*
I
am
very
glad
,
on
your
account
,
of
course
.
I
was
beginning
to
be
afraid
*NL*
that
Mr.
Gania
--
might
have
the
preference
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
ask
you
,
Hippolyte
,
not
to
talk
of
this
subject
?
And
not
to
use
*NL*
such
expressions
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Especially
as
you
know
all
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
wrong
.
I
know
scarcely
anything
,
and
Aglaya
Ivanovna
is
aware
*NL*
that
I
know
nothing

I
knew
nothing
whatever
about
this
meeting

You
say
*NL*
there
was
a
meeting
.
Very
well
;
let
's
leave
it
so

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
do
you

You
said
you
knew

now
suddenly
you
know
*NL*
nothing

You
say
`
very
well
;
let
's
leave
it
so
.
'
But
I
say
,
do
n't
be
*NL*
so
confiding
,
especially
as
you
know
nothing

You
are
confiding
simply
*NL*
_
because
_
you
know
nothing
.
But
do
you
know
what
these
good
people
have
*NL*
in
their
minds

eye

Gania
and
his
sister
?
Perhaps
you
are
suspicious
?
*NL*
Well
,
well
,
I
'll
drop
the
subject
!
''
he
added
,
hastily
,
observing
the
*NL*
prince
's
impatient
gesture
.
``
But
I
've
come
to
you
on
my
own
business
;
*NL*
I
wish
to
make
you
a
clear
explanation
.
What
a
nuisance
it
is
that
one
*NL*
can
not
die
without
explanations
!
I
have
made
such
a
quantity
of
them
*NL*
already
.
Do
you
wish
to
hear
what
I
have
to
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak
away
,
I
am
listening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
but
I
'll
change
my
mind
,
and
begin
about
Gania
.
Just
fancy
*NL*
to
begin
with
,
if
you
can
,
that
I
,
too
,
was
given
an
appointment
at
*NL*
the
green
bench
today
!
However
,
I
wo
n't
deceive
you
;
I
asked
for
the
*NL*
appointment
.
I
said
I
had
a
secret
to
disclose
.
I
do
n't
know
whether
I
*NL*
came
there
too
early
,
I
think
I
must
have
;
but
scarcely
had
I
sat
down
*NL*
beside
Aglaya
Ivanovna
than
I
saw
Gavrila
Ardalionovitch
and
his
sister
*NL*
Varia
coming
along
,
arm
in
arm
,
just
as
though
they
were
enjoying
a
*NL*
morning
walk
together
.
Both
of
them
seemed
very
much
astonished
,
not
*NL*
to
say
disturbed
,
at
seeing
me
;
they
evidently
had
not
expected
*NL*
the
pleasure
.
Aglaya
Ivanovna
blushed
up
,
and
was
actually
a
little
*NL*
confused
.
I
do
n't
know
whether
it
was
merely
because
I
was
there
,
or
*NL*
whether
Gania
's
beauty
was
too
much
for
her
!
But
anyway
,
she
turned
*NL*
crimson
,
and
then
finished
up
the
business
in
a
very
funny
manner
.
*NL*
She
jumped
up
from
her
seat
,
bowed
back
to
Gania
,
smiled
to
Varia
,
and
*NL*
suddenly
observed
:
'
I
only
came
here
to
express
my
gratitude
for
all
*NL*
your
kind
wishes
on
my
behalf
,
and
to
say
that
if
I
find
I
need
your
*NL*
services
,
believe
me
--
'
Here
she
bowed
them
away
,
as
it
were
,
and
they
*NL*
both
marched
off
again
,
looking
very
foolish
.
Gania
evidently
could
not
*NL*
make
head
nor
tail
of
the
matter
,
and
turned
as
red
as
a
lobster
;
but
*NL*
Varia
understood
at
once
that
they
must
get
away
as
quickly
as
they
*NL*
could
,
so
she
dragged
Gania
away
;
she
is
a
great
deal
cleverer
than
he
*NL*
is
.
As
for
myself
,
I
went
there
to
arrange
a
meeting
to
be
held
between
*NL*
Aglaya
Ivanovna
and
Nastasia
Philipovna
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nastasia
Philipovna
!
''
cried
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aha
!
I
think
you
are
growing
less
cool
,
my
friend
,
and
are
beginning
*NL*
to
be
a
trifle
surprised
,
are
n't
you
?
I
'm
glad
that
you
are
not
above
*NL*
ordinary
human
feelings
,
for
once
.
I
'll
console
you
a
little
now
,
after
*NL*
your
consternation
.
See
what
I
get
for
serving
a
young
and
high-souled
*NL*
maiden
!
This
morning
I
received
a
slap
in
the
face
from
the
lady
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
--
a
moral
one
?
''
asked
the
prince
,
involuntarily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
not
a
physical
one
!
I
do
n't
suppose
anyone
--
even
a
woman
--
would
*NL*
raise
a
hand
against
me
now
.
Even
Gania
would
hesitate
!
I
did
think
at
*NL*
one
time
yesterday
,
that
he
would
fly
at
me
,
though
.
I
bet
anything
that
*NL*
I
know
what
you
are
thinking
of
now
!
You
are
thinking
:
`
Of
course
one
*NL*
ca
n't
strike
the
little
wretch
,
but
one
could
suffocate
him
with
a
*NL*
pillow
,
or
a
wet
towel
,
when
he
is
asleep
!
One
_
ought
_
to
get
rid
of
him
*NL*
somehow
.
'
I
can
see
in
your
face
that
you
are
thinking
that
at
this
very
*NL*
second
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
for
a
moment
,
''
said
the
prince
,
with
*NL*
disgust
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
--
I
dreamed
last
night
that
I
was
being
suffocated
with
a
*NL*
wet
cloth
by
--
somebody
.
I
'll
tell
you
who
it
was
--
Rogojin
!
What
do
you
*NL*
think
,
can
a
man
be
suffocated
with
a
wet
cloth
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
heard
so
.
Well
,
we
'll
leave
that
question
just
now
.
Why
am
I
a
*NL*
scandal-monger
?
Why
did
she
call
me
a
scandal-monger
?
And
mind
,
_
after
_
*NL*
she
had
heard
every
word
I
had
to
tell
her
,
and
had
asked
all
sorts
of
*NL*
questions
besides
--
but
such
is
the
way
of
women
.
For
_
her
_
sake
I
entered
*NL*
into
relations
with
Rogojin
--
an
interesting
man
!
At
_
her
_
request
I
*NL*
arranged
a
personal
interview
between
herself
and
Nastasia
Philipovna
.
*NL*
Could
she
have
been
angry
because
I
hinted
that
she
was
enjoying
*NL*
Nastasia
Philipovna
's
`
leavings
'
?
Why
,
I
have
been
impressing
it
upon
*NL*
her
all
this
while
for
her
own
good
.
Two
letters
have
I
written
her
in
*NL*
that
strain
,
and
I
began
straight
off
today
about
its
being
humiliating
*NL*
for
her
.
Besides
,
the
word
`
leavings
'
is
not
my
invention
.
At
all
*NL*
events
,
they
all
used
it
at
Gania
's
,
and
she
used
it
herself
.
So
why
am
*NL*
I
a
scandal-monger
?
I
see
--
I
see
you
are
tremendously
amused
,
at
this
*NL*
moment
!
Probably
you
are
laughing
at
me
and
fitting
those
silly
lines
to
*NL*
my
case
--
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Maybe
sad
Love
upon
his
setting
smiles
,
And
with
vain
hopes
his
*NL*
farewell
hour
beguiles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hippolyte
suddenly
burst
into
a
fit
of
hysterical
laughter
,
which
turned
*NL*
into
a
choking
cough
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Observe
,
''
he
gasped
,
through
his
coughing
,
``
what
a
fellow
Gania
is
!
*NL*
He
talks
about
Nastasia
's
`
leavings
,
'
but
what
does
he
want
to
take
*NL*
himself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
sat
silent
for
a
long
while
.
His
mind
was
filled
with
dread
*NL*
and
horror
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
spoke
of
a
meeting
with
Nastasia
Philipovna
,
''
he
said
at
last
,
in
a
*NL*
low
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

come
!
Surely
you
must
know
that
there
is
to
be
a
meeting
today
*NL*
between
Nastasia

Aglaya
Ivanovna
,
and
that
Nastasia
has
been
sent
*NL*
for
on
purpose

through
Rogojin

from
St.
Petersburg

It
has
been
*NL*
brought
about
by
invitation

Aglaya
Ivanovna

my
own
efforts

Nastasia
is
at
this
moment
with

not
far
from
here

at
Dana

Alexeyevna

that
curious
friend
of
hers

to
this
questionable
*NL*
house
Aglaya
Ivanovna
is
to
proceed
for
a
friendly
chat
with
Nastasia
*NL*
Philipovna
,
and
for
the
settlement
of
several
problems
.
They
are
going
*NL*
to
play
at
arithmetic

did

you
know
about
it

improbable

very
well

improbable

it

that

heard
it

I
must
say

if
a
fly
crosses
the
room

known
all
over

warned

be
grateful

me

Well

probably
in

One
*NL*
more
thing

do
n't
think
that
I
am
telling
you
all
this
for
your
sake

*NL*
Oh
,
dear

no

Do
you
know

I
dedicated
my
confession
to
Aglaya
*NL*
Ivanovna

I
did
though

how
she
took
it

Oh

no

I
may
have
behaved

like
a
cad
to
you

I
have
not
done
_
her
_
any
harm
.
I
do
n't
apologize
for
*NL*
my
words
about
`
leavings
'
and
all
that

I
am
atoning
for
that

you
*NL*
see

by
telling
you
the
place

time
of
the
meeting

Goodbye

You

better
take
your
measures

if
you
are
worthy
the
name

The
*NL*
meeting
is
fixed
for
this
evening

that
's
certain

*NL*
*NL*
Hippolyte
walked
towards
the
door
,
but
the
prince
called
him
back
and
he
*NL*
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
think
Aglaya
Ivanovna
herself
intends
to
go
to
Nastasia

Philipovna

tonight

he
asked

bright
hectic

out
on

cheeks

forehead

*NL*
``
I

absolutely

it

so

Hippolyte

looking
round

``
Nastasia

hardly
go

out

she
has
only
to
go
down
the
steps
and
*NL*
walk
off
,
and
she
need
never
come
back
unless
she
chooses
:
Ships
are
*NL*
burned
behind
one
sometimes
,
and
one
does
n't
care
to
return
whence
one
*NL*
came
.
Life
need
not
consist
only
of
lunches
,
and
dinners
,
and
Prince
*NL*
S
's
.
It
strikes
me
you
take
Aglaya
Ivanovna
for
some
conventional
*NL*
boarding-school
girl
.
I
said
so
to
her
,
and
she
quite
agreed
with
me
.
*NL*
Wait
till
seven
or
eight
o'clock
.
In
your
place
I
would
send
someone
*NL*
there
to
keep
watch
,
so
as
to
seize
the
exact
moment
when
she
steps
out
*NL*
of
the
house
.
Send
Colia
.
He
'll
play
the
spy
with
pleasure
--
for
you
at
*NL*
least
.
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hippolyte
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
reason
for
the
prince
to
set
anyone
to
watch
,
even
if
he
*NL*
had
been
capable
of
such
a
thing
.
Aglaya
's
command
that
he
should
stay
*NL*
at
home
all
day
seemed
almost
explained
now
.
Perhaps
she
meant
to
call
*NL*
for
him
,
herself
,
or
it
might
be
,
of
course
,
that
she
was
anxious
to
*NL*
make
sure
of
his
not
coming
there
,
and
therefore
bade
him
remain
at
*NL*
home
.
His
head
whirled
;
the
whole
room
seemed
to
be
turning
round
.
He
*NL*
lay
down
on
the
sofa
,
and
closed
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
way
or
the
other
the
question
was
to
be
decided
at
last
--
finally
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
,
no
,
he
did
not
think
of
Aglaya
as
a
boarding-school
miss
,
or
a
young
*NL*
lady
of
the
conventional
type
!
He
had
long
since
feared
that
she
might
*NL*
take
some
such
step
as
this
.
But
why
did
she
wish
to
see
Nastasia
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
shivered
all
over
as
he
lay
;
he
was
in
high
fever
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
!
he
did
not
account
her
a
child
.
Certain
of
her
looks
,
certain
of
her
*NL*
words
,
of
late
,
had
filled
him
with
apprehension
.
At
times
it
had
struck
*NL*
him
that
she
was
putting
too
great
a
restraint
upon
herself
,
and
he
*NL*
remembered
that
he
had
been
alarmed
to
observe
this
.
He
had
tried
,
all
*NL*
these
days
,
to
drive
away
the
heavy
thoughts
that
oppressed
him
;
*NL*
but
what
was
the
hidden
mystery
of
that
soul
?
The
question
had
long
*NL*
tormented
him
,
although
he
implicitly
trusted
that
soul
.
And
now
it
was
*NL*
all
to
be
cleared
up
.
It
was
a
dreadful
thought
.
And
``
that
woman
''
again
!
*NL*
Why
did
he
always
feel
as
though
``
that
woman
''
were
fated
to
appear
at
*NL*
each
critical
moment
of
his
life
,
and
tear
the
thread
of
his
destiny
*NL*
like
a
bit
of
rotten
string
?
That
he
always
_
had
_
felt
this
he
was
ready
*NL*
to
swear
,
although
he
was
half
delirious
at
the
moment
.
If
he
had
tried
*NL*
to
forget
her
,
all
this
time
,
it
was
simply
because
he
was
afraid
of
*NL*
her
.
Did
he
love
the
woman
or
hate
her
?
This
question
he
did
not
once
*NL*
ask
himself
today
;
his
heart
was
quite
pure
.
He
knew
whom
he
loved
.
He
*NL*
was
not
so
much
afraid
of
this
meeting
,
nor
of
its
strangeness
,
nor
of
*NL*
any
reasons
there
might
be
for
it
,
unknown
to
himself
;
he
was
afraid
*NL*
of
the
woman
herself
,
Nastasia
Philipovna
.
He
remembered
,
some
days
*NL*
afterwards
,
how
during
all
those
fevered
hours
he
had
seen
but
_
her
_
eyes
,
*NL*
_
her
_
look
,
had
heard
_
her
_
voice
,
strange
words
of
hers
;
he
remembered
*NL*
that
this
was
so
,
although
he
could
not
recollect
the
details
of
his
*NL*
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
remember
that
Vera
brought
him
some
dinner
,
and
that
he
took
*NL*
it
;
but
whether
he
slept
after
dinner
,
or
no
,
he
could
not
recollect
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
only
knew
that
he
began
to
distinguish
things
clearly
from
the
moment
*NL*
when
Aglaya
suddenly
appeared
,
and
he
jumped
up
from
the
sofa
and
went
*NL*
to
meet
her
.
It
was
just
a
quarter
past
seven
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aglaya
was
quite
alone
,
and
dressed
,
apparently
hastily
,
in
a
light
*NL*
mantle
.
Her
face
was
pale
,
as
it
had
been
in
the
morning
,
and
her
*NL*
eyes
were
ablaze
with
bright
but
subdued
fire
.
He
had
never
seen
that
*NL*
expression
in
her
eyes
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
gazed
attentively
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
quite
ready
,
I
observe
,
''
she
said
,
with
absolute
composure
,
*NL*
``
dressed
,
and
your
hat
in
your
hand
.
I
see
somebody
has
thought
fit
to
*NL*
warn
you
,
and
I
know
who
.
Hippolyte
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
he
told
me
,
''
said
the
prince
,
feeling
only
half
alive
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
then
.
You
know
,
I
suppose
,
that
you
must
escort
me
there
?
You
are
*NL*
well
enough
to
go
out
,
are
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
well
enough
;
but
is
it
really
possible
?
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
broke
off
abruptly
,
and
could
not
add
another
word
.
This
was
his
one
*NL*
attempt
to
stop
the
mad
child
,
and
,
after
he
had
made
it
,
he
followed
*NL*
her
as
though
he
had
no
will
of
his
own
.
Confused
as
his
thoughts
were
,
*NL*
he
was
,
nevertheless
,
capable
of
realizing
the
fact
that
if
he
did
*NL*
not
go
with
her
,
she
would
go
alone
,
and
so
he
must
go
with
her
at
all
*NL*
hazards
.
He
guessed
the
strength
of
her
determination
;
it
was
beyond
him
*NL*
to
check
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
walked
silently
,
and
said
scarcely
a
word
all
the
way
.
He
only
*NL*
noticed
that
she
seemed
to
know
the
road
very
well
;
and
once
,
when
he
*NL*
thought
it
better
to
go
by
a
certain
lane
,
and
remarked
to
her
that
it
*NL*
would
be
quieter
and
less
public
,
she
only
said
,
``
it
's
all
the
same
,
''
*NL*
and
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
were
almost
arrived
at
Daria
Alexeyevna
's
house
-LRB-
it
was
a
*NL*
large
wooden
structure
of
ancient
date
-RRB-
,
a
gorgeously-dressed
lady
and
*NL*
a
young
girl
came
out
of
it
.
Both
these
ladies
took
their
seats
in
a
*NL*
carriage
,
which
was
waiting
at
the
door
,
talking
and
laughing
loudly
*NL*
the
while
,
and
drove
away
without
appearing
to
notice
the
approaching
*NL*
couple
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
sooner
had
the
carriage
driven
off
than
the
door
opened
once
more
;
*NL*
and
Rogojin
,
who
had
apparently
been
awaiting
them
,
let
them
in
and
*NL*
closed
it
after
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
not
another
soul
in
the
house
now
excepting
our
four
selves
,
''
*NL*
he
said
aloud
,
looking
at
the
prince
in
a
strange
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nastasia
Philipovna
was
waiting
for
them
in
the
first
room
they
went
*NL*
into
.
She
was
dressed
very
simply
,
in
black
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
rose
at
their
entrance
,
but
did
not
smile
or
give
her
hand
,
even
to
*NL*
the
prince
.
Her
anxious
eyes
were
fixed
upon
Aglaya
.
Both
sat
down
,
at
*NL*
a
little
distance
from
one
another
--
Aglaya
on
the
sofa
,
in
the
corner
*NL*
of
the
room
,
Nastasia
by
the
window
.
The
prince
and
Rogojin
remained
*NL*
standing
,
and
were
not
invited
to
sit
.
*NL*
*NL*
Muishkin
glanced
at
Rogojin
in
perplexity
,
but
the
latter
only
smiled
*NL*
disagreeably
,
and
said
nothing
.
The
silence
continued
for
some
few
*NL*
moments
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
ominous
expression
passed
over
Nastasia
Philipovna
's
face
,
of
a
*NL*
sudden
.
It
became
obstinate-looking
,
hard
,
and
full
of
hatred
;
but
she
*NL*
did
not
take
her
eyes
off
her
visitors
for
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aglaya
was
clearly
confused
,
but
not
frightened
.
On
entering
she
had
*NL*
merely
glanced
momentarily
at
her
rival
,
and
then
had
sat
still
,
with
*NL*
her
eyes
on
the
ground
,
apparently
in
thought
.
Once
or
twice
she
*NL*
glanced
casually
round
the
room
.
A
shade
of
disgust
was
visible
in
her
*NL*
expression
;
she
looked
as
though
she
were
afraid
of
contamination
in
*NL*
this
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
mechanically
arranged
her
dress
,
and
fidgeted
uncomfortably
,
*NL*
eventually
changing
her
seat
to
the
other
end
of
the
sofa
.
Probably
*NL*
she
was
unconscious
of
her
own
movements
;
but
this
very
unconsciousness
*NL*
added
to
the
offensiveness
of
their
suggested
meaning
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
she
looked
straight
into
Nastasia
's
eyes
,
and
instantly
read
*NL*
all
there
was
to
read
in
her
rival
's
expression
.
Woman
understood
woman
!
*NL*
Aglaya
shuddered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
of
course
why
I
requested
this
meeting
?
''
she
said
at
last
,
*NL*
quietly
,
and
pausing
twice
in
the
delivery
of
this
very
short
sentence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
I
know
nothing
about
it
,
''
said
Nastasia
,
drily
and
abruptly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aglaya
blushed
.
Perhaps
it
struck
her
as
very
strange
and
impossible
*NL*
that
she
should
really
be
sitting
here
and
waiting
for
``
that
woman
's
''
*NL*
reply
to
her
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
first
sound
of
Nastasia
's
voice
a
shudder
ran
through
her
frame
.
*NL*
Of
course
``
that
woman
''
observed
and
took
in
all
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
quite
well
,
but
you
are
pretending
to
be
ignorant
,
''
said
*NL*
Aglaya
,
very
low
,
with
her
eyes
on
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
I
?
''
asked
Nastasia
Philipovna
,
smiling
slightly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
want
to
take
advantage
of
my
position
,
now
that
I
am
in
your
*NL*
house
,
''
continued
Aglaya
,
awkwardly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
that
position
_
you
_
are
to
blame
and
not
I
,
''
said
Nastasia
,
flaring
*NL*
up
suddenly
.
''
_
I
_
did
not
invite
_
you
_
,
but
you
me
;
and
to
this
moment
I
*NL*
am
quite
ignorant
as
to
why
I
am
thus
honoured
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Aglaya
raised
her
head
haughtily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Restrain
your
tongue
!
''
she
said
.
``
I
did
not
come
here
to
fight
you
with
*NL*
your
own
weapons
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
then
you
did
come
`
to
fight
,
'
I
may
conclude
?
Dear
me
!
--
and
I
*NL*
thought
you
were
cleverer
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
looked
at
one
another
with
undisguised
malice
.
One
of
these
women
*NL*
had
written
to
the
other
,
so
lately
,
such
letters
as
we
have
seen
;
and
*NL*
it
all
was
dispersed
at
their
first
meeting
.
Yet
it
appeared
that
*NL*
not
one
of
the
four
persons
in
the
room
considered
this
in
any
degree
*NL*
strange
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
who
,
up
to
yesterday
,
would
not
have
believed
that
he
could
*NL*
even
dream
of
such
an
impossible
scene
as
this
,
stood
and
listened
and
*NL*
looked
on
,
and
felt
as
though
he
had
long
foreseen
it
all
.
The
most
*NL*
fantastic
dream
seemed
suddenly
to
have
been
metamorphosed
into
the
most
*NL*
vivid
reality
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
these
women
so
despised
the
other
,
and
so
longed
to
express
her
*NL*
contempt
for
her
-LRB-
perhaps
she
had
only
come
for
that
very
purpose
,
as
*NL*
Rogojin
said
next
day
-RRB-
,
that
howsoever
fantastical
was
the
other
woman
,
*NL*
howsoever
afflicted
her
spirit
and
disturbed
her
understanding
,
no
*NL*
preconceived
idea
of
hers
could
possibly
stand
up
against
that
deadly
*NL*
feminine
contempt
of
her
rival
.
The
prince
felt
sure
that
Nastasia
*NL*
would
say
nothing
about
the
letters
herself
;
but
he
could
judge
by
her
*NL*
flashing
eyes
and
the
expression
of
her
face
what
the
thought
of
those
*NL*
letters
must
be
costing
her
at
this
moment
.
He
would
have
given
half
his
*NL*
life
to
prevent
Aglaya
from
speaking
of
them
.
But
Aglaya
suddenly
braced
*NL*
herself
up
,
and
seemed
to
master
herself
fully
,
all
in
an
instant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
not
quite
understood
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
did
not
come
to
quarrel
*NL*
with
you
,
though
I
do
not
like
you
.
I
came
to
speak
to
you
as
...
as
one
*NL*
human
being
to
another
.
I
came
with
my
mind
made
up
as
to
what
I
had
*NL*
to
say
to
you
,
and
I
shall
not
change
my
intention
,
although
you
may
*NL*
misunderstand
me
.
So
much
the
worse
for
you
,
not
for
myself
!
I
wished
to
*NL*
reply
to
all
you
have
written
to
me
and
to
reply
personally
,
because
I
*NL*
think
that
is
the
more
convenient
way
.
Listen
to
my
reply
to
all
your
*NL*
letters
.
I
began
to
be
sorry
for
Prince
Lef
Nicolaievitch
on
the
very
*NL*
day
I
made
his
acquaintance
,
and
when
I
heard
--
afterwards
--
of
all
that
*NL*
took
place
at
your
house
in
the
evening
,
I
was
sorry
for
him
because
he
*NL*
was
such
a
simple-minded
man
,
and
because
he
,
in
the
simplicity
of
his
*NL*
soul
,
believed
that
he
could
be
happy
with
a
woman
of
your
character
.
*NL*
What
I
feared
actually
took
place
;
you
could
not
love
him
,
you
tortured
*NL*
him
,
and
threw
him
over
.
You
could
not
love
him
because
you
are
too
*NL*
proud
--
no
,
not
proud
,
that
is
an
error
;
because
you
are
too
vain
--
no
,
*NL*
not
quite
that
either
;
too
self-loving
;
you
are
self-loving
to
madness
.
*NL*
Your
letters
to
me
are
a
proof
of
it
.
You
could
not
love
so
simple
a
*NL*
soul
as
his
,
and
perhaps
in
your
heart
you
despised
him
and
laughed
at
*NL*
him
.
All
you
could
love
was
your
shame
and
the
perpetual
thought
that
*NL*
you
were
disgraced
and
insulted
.
If
you
were
less
shameful
,
or
had
no
*NL*
cause
at
all
for
shame
,
you
would
be
still
more
unhappy
than
you
are
*NL*
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Aglaya
brought
out
these
thronging
words
with
great
satisfaction
.
They
*NL*
came
from
her
lips
hurriedly
and
impetuously
,
and
had
been
prepared
and
*NL*
thought
out
long
ago
,
even
before
she
had
ever
dreamed
of
the
present
*NL*
meeting
.
She
watched
with
eagerness
the
effect
of
her
speech
as
shown
in
*NL*
Nastasia
's
face
,
which
was
distorted
with
agitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
remember
,
''
she
continued
,
``
he
wrote
me
a
letter
at
that
time
;
*NL*
he
says
you
know
all
about
that
letter
and
that
you
even
read
it
.
I
*NL*
understand
all
by
means
of
this
letter
,
and
understand
it
correctly
.
He
*NL*
has
since
confirmed
it
all
to
me
--
what
I
now
say
to
you
,
word
for
word
.
*NL*
After
receiving
his
letter
I
waited
;
I
guessed
that
you
would
soon
come
*NL*
back
here
,
because
you
could
never
do
without
Petersburg
;
you
are
still
*NL*
too
young
and
lovely
for
the
provinces
.
However
,
this
is
not
my
own
*NL*
idea
,
''
she
added
,
blushing
dreadfully
;
and
from
this
moment
the
colour
*NL*
never
left
her
cheeks
to
the
end
of
her
speech
.
``
When
I
next
saw
the
*NL*
prince
I
began
to
feel
terribly
pained
and
hurt
on
his
account
.
Do
not
*NL*
laugh
;
if
you
laugh
you
are
unworthy
of
understanding
what
I
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
you
see
that
I
am
not
laughing
,
''
said
Nastasia
,
sadly
and
*NL*
sternly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
However
,
it
's
all
the
same
to
me
;
laugh
or
not
,
just
as
you
please
.
*NL*
When
I
asked
him
about
you
,
he
told
me
that
he
had
long
since
ceased
to
*NL*
love
you
,
that
the
very
recollection
of
you
was
a
torture
to
him
,
but
*NL*
that
he
was
sorry
for
you
;
and
that
when
he
thought
of
you
his
heart
was
*NL*
pierced
.
I
ought
to
tell
you
that
I
never
in
my
life
met
a
man
anything
*NL*
like
him
for
noble
simplicity
of
mind
and
for
boundless
trustfulness
.
*NL*
I
guessed
that
anyone
who
liked
could
deceive
him
,
and
that
he
would
*NL*
immediately
forgive
anyone
who
did
deceive
him
;
and
it
was
for
this
that
*NL*
I
grew
to
love
him
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Aglaya
paused
for
a
moment
,
as
though
suddenly
brought
up
in
*NL*
astonishment
that
she
could
have
said
these
words
,
but
at
the
same
time
*NL*
a
great
pride
shone
in
her
eyes
,
like
a
defiant
assertion
that
it
would
*NL*
not
matter
to
her
if
``
this
woman
''
laughed
in
her
face
for
the
admission
*NL*
just
made
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
told
you
all
now
,
and
of
course
you
understand
what
I
wish
of
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
I
do
;
but
tell
me
yourself
,
''
said
Nastasia
Philipovna
,
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aglaya
flushed
up
angrily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wished
to
find
out
from
you
,
''
she
said
,
firmly
,
``
by
what
right
you
*NL*
dare
to
meddle
with
his
feelings
for
me
?
By
what
right
you
dared
send
me
*NL*
those
letters
?
By
what
right
do
you
continually
remind
both
me
and
him
*NL*
that
you
love
him
,
after
you
yourself
threw
him
over
and
ran
away
from
*NL*
him
in
so
insulting
and
shameful
a
way
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
told
either
him
or
you
that
I
loved
him
!
''
replied
Nastasia
*NL*
Philipovna
,
with
an
effort
.
``
And
--
and
I
did
run
away
from
him
--
you
are
*NL*
right
there
,
''
she
added
,
scarcely
audibly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
told
either
him
or
me
?
''
cried
Aglaya
.
``
How
about
your
letters
?
*NL*
Who
asked
you
to
try
to
persuade
me
to
marry
him
?
Was
not
that
a
*NL*
declaration
from
you
?
Why
do
you
force
yourself
upon
us
in
this
way
?
I
*NL*
confess
I
thought
at
first
that
you
were
anxious
to
arouse
an
aversion
*NL*
for
him
in
my
heart
by
your
meddling
,
in
order
that
I
might
give
him
up
;
*NL*
and
it
was
only
afterwards
that
I
guessed
the
truth
.
You
imagined
that
*NL*
you
were
doing
an
heroic
action
!
How
could
you
spare
any
love
for
him
,
*NL*
when
you
love
your
own
vanity
to
such
an
extent
?
Why
could
you
not
*NL*
simply
go
away
from
here
,
instead
of
writing
me
those
absurd
letters
?
*NL*
Why
do
you
not
_
now
_
marry
that
generous
man
who
loves
you
,
and
has
done
*NL*
you
the
honour
of
offering
you
his
hand
?
It
is
plain
enough
why
;
if
you
*NL*
marry
Rogojin
you
lose
your
grievance
;
you
will
have
nothing
more
to
*NL*
complain
of
.
You
will
be
receiving
too
much
honour
.
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
*NL*
was
saying
the
other
day
that
you
had
read
too
many
poems
and
are
too
*NL*
well
educated
for
--
your
position
;
and
that
you
live
in
idleness
.
Add
to
*NL*
this
your
vanity
,
and
,
there
you
have
reason
enough
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
not
live
in
idleness
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Things
had
come
to
this
unexpected
point
too
quickly
.
Unexpected
because
*NL*
Nastasia
Philipovna
,
on
her
way
to
Pavlofsk
,
had
thought
and
considered
*NL*
a
good
deal
,
and
had
expected
something
different
,
though
perhaps
not
*NL*
altogether
good
,
from
this
interview
;
but
Aglaya
had
been
carried
away
*NL*
by
her
own
outburst
,
just
as
a
rolling
stone
gathers
impetus
as
it
*NL*
careers
downhill
,
and
could
not
restrain
herself
in
the
satisfaction
of
*NL*
revenge
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
strange
,
Nastasia
Philipovna
felt
,
to
see
Aglaya
like
this
.
She
*NL*
gazed
at
her
,
and
could
hardly
believe
her
eyes
and
ears
for
a
moment
or
*NL*
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
she
were
a
woman
who
had
read
too
many
poems
,
as
Evgenie
*NL*
Pavlovitch
supposed
,
or
whether
she
were
mad
,
as
the
prince
had
*NL*
assured
Aglaya
,
at
all
events
,
this
was
a
woman
who
,
in
spite
of
her
*NL*
occasionally
cynical
and
audacious
manner
,
was
far
more
refined
and
*NL*
trustful
and
sensitive
than
appeared
.
There
was
a
certain
amount
of
*NL*
romantic
dreaminess
and
caprice
in
her
,
but
with
the
fantastic
was
*NL*
mingled
much
that
was
strong
and
deep
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
realized
this
,
and
great
suffering
expressed
itself
in
his
*NL*
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aglaya
observed
it
,
and
trembled
with
anger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
dare
you
speak
so
to
me
?
''
she
said
,
with
a
haughtiness
which
was
*NL*
quite
indescribable
,
replying
to
Nastasia
's
last
remark
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
have
misunderstood
what
I
said
,
''
said
Nastasia
,
in
some
*NL*
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
wished
to
preserve
your
good
name
,
why
did
you
not
give
up
*NL*
your
--
your
`
guardian
,
'
Totski
,
without
all
that
theatrical
posturing
?
''
*NL*
said
Aglaya
,
suddenly
a
propos
of
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
know
of
my
position
,
that
you
dare
to
judge
me
?
''
cried
*NL*
Nastasia
,
quivering
with
rage
,
and
growing
terribly
white
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
this
much
,
that
you
did
not
go
out
to
honest
work
,
but
went
away
*NL*
with
a
rich
man
,
Rogojin
,
in
order
to
pose
as
a
fallen
angel
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
wonder
that
Totski
was
nearly
driven
to
suicide
by
such
a
fallen
angel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Silence
!
''
cried
Nastasia
Philipovna
.
``
You
are
about
as
fit
to
*NL*
understand
me
as
the
housemaid
here
,
who
bore
witness
against
her
lover
*NL*
in
court
the
other
day
.
She
would
understand
me
better
than
you
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Probably
an
honest
girl
living
by
her
own
toil
.
Why
do
you
speak
of
a
*NL*
housemaid
so
contemptuously
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
despise
toil
;
I
despise
you
when
you
speak
of
toil
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
had
cared
to
be
an
honest
woman
,
you
would
have
gone
out
as
a
*NL*
laundress
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Both
had
risen
,
and
were
gazing
at
one
another
with
pallid
faces
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aglaya
,
do
n't
!
This
is
unfair
,
''
cried
the
prince
,
deeply
distressed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rogojin
was
not
smiling
now
;
he
sat
and
listened
with
folded
arms
,
and
*NL*
lips
tight
compressed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
look
at
her
,
''
cried
Nastasia
,
trembling
with
passion
.
``
Look
at
*NL*
this
young
lady
!
And
I
imagined
her
an
angel
!
Did
you
come
to
me
without
*NL*
your
governess
,
Aglaya
Ivanovna
?
Oh
,
fie
,
now
shall
I
just
tell
you
why
*NL*
you
came
here
today
?
Shall
I
tell
you
without
any
embellishments
?
You
*NL*
came
because
you
were
afraid
of
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Afraid
of
_
you
?
_
''
asked
Aglaya
,
beside
herself
with
naive
amazement
that
*NL*
the
other
should
dare
talk
to
her
like
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
me
,
of
course
!
Of
course
you
were
afraid
of
me
,
or
you
would
not
*NL*
have
decided
to
come
.
You
can
not
despise
one
you
fear
.
And
to
think
that
*NL*
I
have
actually
esteemed
you
up
to
this
very
moment
!
Do
you
know
why
*NL*
you
are
afraid
of
me
,
and
what
is
your
object
now
?
You
wished
to
satisfy
*NL*
yourself
with
your
own
eyes
as
to
which
he
loves
best
,
myself
or
you
,
*NL*
because
you
are
fearfully
jealous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
told
me
already
that
he
hates
you
,
''
murmured
Aglaya
,
scarcely
*NL*
audibly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
,
perhaps
!
I
am
not
worthy
of
him
,
I
know
.
But
I
think
you
are
*NL*
lying
,
all
the
same
.
He
can
not
hate
me
,
and
he
can
not
have
said
so
.
I
am
*NL*
ready
to
forgive
you
,
in
consideration
of
your
position
;
but
I
confess
*NL*
I
thought
better
of
you
.
I
thought
you
were
wiser
,
and
more
beautiful
,
*NL*
too
;
I
did
,
indeed
!
Well
,
take
your
treasure
!
See
,
he
is
gazing
at
you
,
*NL*
he
ca
n't
recollect
himself
.
Take
him
,
but
on
one
condition
;
go
away
at
*NL*
once
,
this
instant
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
fell
back
into
a
chair
,
and
burst
into
tears
.
But
suddenly
some
new
*NL*
expression
blazed
in
her
eyes
.
She
stared
fixedly
at
Aglaya
,
and
rose
*NL*
from
her
seat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
would
you
like
me
to
bid
him
,
_
bid
him
_

do
you
hear

command
him
_
,
*NL*
now
,
at
once
,
to
throw
you
up
,
and
remain
mine
for
ever
?
Shall
I
?
He
*NL*
will
stay
,
and
he
will
marry
me
too
,
and
you
shall
trot
home
all
alone
.
*NL*
Shall
I
?
--
shall
I
say
the
word
?
''
she
screamed
like
a
madwoman
,
scarcely
*NL*
believing
herself
that
she
could
really
pronounce
such
wild
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aglaya
had
made
for
the
door
in
terror
,
but
she
stopped
at
the
*NL*
threshold
,
and
listened
.
``
Shall
I
turn
Rogojin
off
?
Ha
!
ha
!
you
thought
*NL*
I
would
marry
him
for
your
benefit
,
did
you
?
Why
,
I
'll
call
out
_
now
_
,
if
*NL*
you
like
,
in
your
presence
,
`
Rogojin
,
get
out
!
'
and
say
to
the
prince
,
*NL*
`
Do
you
remember
what
you
promised
me
?
'
Heavens
!
what
a
fool
I
have
been
*NL*
to
humiliate
myself
before
them
!
Why
,
prince
,
you
yourself
gave
me
your
*NL*
word
that
you
would
marry
me
whatever
happened
,
and
would
never
abandon
*NL*
me
.
You
said
you
loved
me
and
would
forgive
me
all
,
and
--
and
resp
--
yes
,
*NL*
you
even
said
that
!
I
only
ran
away
from
you
in
order
to
set
you
free
,
*NL*
and
now
I
do
n't
care
to
let
you
go
again
.
Why
does
she
treat
me
so
--
so
*NL*
shamefully
?
I
am
not
a
loose
woman
--
ask
Rogojin
there
!
He
'll
tell
you
.
*NL*
Will
you
go
again
now
that
she
has
insulted
me
,
before
your
eyes
,
too
;
*NL*
turn
away
from
me
and
lead
her
away
,
arm-in-arm
?
May
you
be
accursed
*NL*
too
,
for
you
were
the
only
one
I
trusted
among
them
all
!
Go
away
,
*NL*
Rogojin
,
I
do
n't
want
you
,
''
she
continued
,
blind
with
fury
,
and
forcing
*NL*
the
words
out
with
dry
lips
and
distorted
features
,
evidently
not
*NL*
believing
a
single
word
of
her
own
tirade
,
but
,
at
the
same
time
,
doing
*NL*
her
utmost
to
prolong
the
moment
of
self-deception
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
outburst
was
so
terribly
violent
that
the
prince
thought
it
would
*NL*
have
killed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
he
is
!
''
she
shrieked
again
,
pointing
to
the
prince
and
addressing
*NL*
Aglaya
.
``
There
he
is
!
and
if
he
does
not
approach
me
at
once
and
take
*NL*
_
me
_
and
throw
you
over
,
then
have
him
for
your
own
--
I
give
him
up
to
*NL*
you
!
I
do
n't
want
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Both
she
and
Aglaya
stood
and
waited
as
though
in
expectation
,
and
both
*NL*
looked
at
the
prince
like
madwomen
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
,
perhaps
,
did
not
understand
the
full
force
of
this
challenge
;
in
*NL*
fact
,
it
is
certain
he
did
not
.
All
he
could
see
was
the
poor
despairing
*NL*
face
which
,
as
he
had
said
to
Aglaya
,
``
had
pierced
his
heart
for
ever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
bear
it
no
longer
,
and
with
a
look
of
entreaty
,
mingled
with
*NL*
reproach
,
he
addressed
Aglaya
,
pointing
to
Nastasia
the
while
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
you
?
''
he
murmured
;
``
she
is
so
unhappy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
had
no
time
to
say
another
word
before
.
Aglaya
's
terrible
look
*NL*
bereft
him
of
speech
.
In
that
look
was
embodied
so
dreadful
a
suffering
*NL*
and
so
deadly
a
hatred
,
that
he
gave
a
cry
and
flew
to
her
;
but
it
was
*NL*
too
late
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
not
hold
out
long
enough
even
to
witness
his
movement
in
her
*NL*
direction
.
She
had
hidden
her
face
in
her
hands
,
cried
once
``
Oh
,
my
*NL*
God
!
''
and
rushed
out
of
the
room
.
Rogojin
followed
her
to
undo
the
bolts
*NL*
of
the
door
and
let
her
out
into
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
made
a
rush
after
her
,
but
he
was
caught
and
held
back
.
The
*NL*
distorted
,
livid
face
of
Nastasia
gazed
at
him
reproachfully
,
and
her
*NL*
blue
lips
whispered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
Would
you
go
to
her
--
to
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
fell
senseless
into
his
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
raised
her
,
carried
her
into
the
room
,
placed
her
in
an
arm-chair
,
*NL*
and
stood
over
her
,
stupefied
.
On
the
table
stood
a
tumbler
of
water
.
*NL*
Rogojin
,
who
now
returned
,
took
this
and
sprinkled
a
little
in
her
face
.
*NL*
She
opened
her
eyes
,
but
for
a
moment
she
understood
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
she
looked
around
,
shuddered
,
gave
a
loud
cry
,
and
threw
*NL*
herself
in
the
prince
's
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mine
,
mine
!
''
she
cried
.
``
Has
the
proud
young
lady
gone
?
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
''
*NL*
she
laughed
hysterically
.
``
And
I
had
given
him
up
to
her
!
Why
--
why
did
*NL*
I
?
Mad
--
mad
!
Get
away
,
Rogojin
!
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rogojin
stared
intently
at
them
;
then
he
took
his
hat
,
and
without
a
*NL*
word
,
left
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
moments
later
,
the
prince
was
seated
by
Nastasia
on
the
sofa
,
*NL*
gazing
into
her
eyes
and
stroking
her
face
and
hair
,
as
he
would
a
*NL*
little
child
's
.
He
laughed
when
she
laughed
,
and
was
ready
to
cry
when
*NL*
she
cried
.
He
did
not
speak
,
but
listened
to
her
excited
,
disconnected
*NL*
chatter
,
hardly
understanding
a
word
of
it
the
while
.
No
sooner
did
*NL*
he
detect
the
slightest
appearance
of
complaining
,
or
weeping
,
or
*NL*
reproaching
,
than
he
would
smile
at
her
kindly
,
and
begin
stroking
her
*NL*
hair
and
her
cheeks
,
soothing
and
consoling
her
once
more
,
as
if
she
*NL*
were
a
child
.

*NL*
*NL*
A
fortnight
had
passed
since
the
events
recorded
in
the
last
chapter
,
*NL*
and
the
position
of
the
actors
in
our
story
had
become
so
changed
that
*NL*
it
is
almost
impossible
for
us
to
continue
the
tale
without
some
few
*NL*
explanations
.
Yet
we
feel
that
we
ought
to
limit
ourselves
to
the
simple
*NL*
record
of
facts
,
without
much
attempt
at
explanation
,
for
a
very
patent
*NL*
reason
:
because
we
ourselves
have
the
greatest
possible
difficulty
in
*NL*
accounting
for
the
facts
to
be
recorded
.
Such
a
statement
on
our
part
*NL*
may
appear
strange
to
the
reader
.
How
is
anyone
to
tell
a
story
which
he
*NL*
can
not
understand
himself
?
In
order
to
keep
clear
of
a
false
position
,
*NL*
we
had
perhaps
better
give
an
example
of
what
we
mean
;
and
probably
the
*NL*
intelligent
reader
will
soon
understand
the
difficulty
.
More
especially
*NL*
are
we
inclined
to
take
this
course
since
the
example
will
constitute
a
*NL*
distinct
march
forward
of
our
story
,
and
will
not
hinder
the
progress
of
*NL*
the
events
remaining
to
be
recorded
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
next
fortnight
--
that
is
,
through
the
early
part
of
July
--
the
*NL*
history
of
our
hero
was
circulated
in
the
form
of
strange
,
diverting
,
*NL*
most
unlikely-sounding
stories
,
which
passed
from
mouth
to
mouth
,
*NL*
through
the
streets
and
villas
adjoining
those
inhabited
by
Lebedeff
,
*NL*
Ptitsin
,
Nastasia
Philipovna
and
the
Epanchins
;
in
fact
,
pretty
*NL*
well
through
the
whole
town
and
its
environs
.
All
society
--
both
the
*NL*
inhabitants
of
the
place
and
those
who
came
down
of
an
evening
for
the
*NL*
music
--
had
got
hold
of
one
and
the
same
story
,
in
a
thousand
varieties
*NL*
of
detail
--
as
to
how
a
certain
young
prince
had
raised
a
terrible
*NL*
scandal
in
a
most
respectable
household
,
had
thrown
over
a
daughter
of
*NL*
the
family
,
to
whom
he
was
engaged
,
and
had
been
captured
by
a
woman
of
*NL*
shady
reputation
whom
he
was
determined
to
marry
at
once
--
breaking
off
*NL*
all
old
ties
for
the
satisfaction
of
his
insane
idea
;
and
,
in
spite
of
*NL*
the
public
indignation
roused
by
his
action
,
the
marriage
was
to
take
*NL*
place
in
Pavlofsk
openly
and
publicly
,
and
the
prince
had
announced
his
*NL*
intention
of
going
through
with
it
with
head
erect
and
looking
the
whole
*NL*
world
in
the
face
.
The
story
was
so
artfully
adorned
with
scandalous
*NL*
details
,
and
persons
of
so
great
eminence
and
importance
were
*NL*
apparently
mixed
up
in
it
,
while
,
at
the
same
time
,
the
evidence
was
so
*NL*
circumstantial
,
that
it
was
no
wonder
the
matter
gave
food
for
plenty
of
*NL*
curiosity
and
gossip
.
*NL*
*NL*
According
to
the
reports
of
the
most
talented
gossip-mongers
--
those
who
,
*NL*
in
every
class
of
society
,
are
always
in
haste
to
explain
every
event
*NL*
to
their
neighbours
--
the
young
gentleman
concerned
was
of
good
family
--
a
*NL*
prince
--
fairly
rich
--
weak
of
intellect
,
but
a
democrat
and
a
dabbler
*NL*
in
the
Nihilism
of
the
period
,
as
exposed
by
Mr.
Turgenieff
.
He
could
*NL*
hardly
talk
Russian
,
but
had
fallen
in
love
with
one
of
the
Miss
*NL*
Epanchins
,
and
his
suit
met
with
so
much
encouragement
that
he
had
been
*NL*
received
in
the
house
as
the
recognized
bridegroom-to-be
of
the
young
*NL*
lady
.
But
like
the
Frenchman
of
whom
the
story
is
told
that
he
studied
*NL*
for
holy
orders
,
took
all
the
oaths
,
was
ordained
priest
,
and
next
*NL*
morning
wrote
to
his
bishop
informing
him
that
,
as
he
did
not
believe
*NL*
in
God
and
considered
it
wrong
to
deceive
the
people
and
live
upon
their
*NL*
pockets
,
he
begged
to
surrender
the
orders
conferred
upon
him
the
day
*NL*
before
,
and
to
inform
his
lordship
that
he
was
sending
this
letter
to
*NL*
the
public
press
,
--
like
this
Frenchman
,
the
prince
played
a
false
game
.
*NL*
It
was
rumoured
that
he
had
purposely
waited
for
the
solemn
occasion
of
*NL*
a
large
evening
party
at
the
house
of
his
future
bride
,
at
which
he
was
*NL*
introduced
to
several
eminent
persons
,
in
order
publicly
to
make
known
*NL*
his
ideas
and
opinions
,
and
thereby
insult
the
``
big-wigs
,
''
and
to
throw
*NL*
over
his
bride
as
offensively
as
possible
;
and
that
,
resisting
the
*NL*
servants
who
were
told
off
to
turn
him
out
of
the
house
,
he
had
seized
*NL*
and
thrown
down
a
magnificent
china
vase
.
As
a
characteristic
addition
*NL*
to
the
above
,
it
was
currently
reported
that
the
young
prince
really
*NL*
loved
the
lady
to
whom
he
was
engaged
,
and
had
thrown
her
over
out
of
*NL*
purely
Nihilistic
motives
,
with
the
intention
of
giving
himself
the
*NL*
satisfaction
of
marrying
a
fallen
woman
in
the
face
of
all
the
world
,
*NL*
thereby
publishing
his
opinion
that
there
is
no
distinction
between
*NL*
virtuous
and
disreputable
women
,
but
that
all
women
are
alike
,
free
;
and
*NL*
a
``
fallen
''
woman
,
indeed
,
somewhat
superior
to
a
virtuous
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
declared
that
he
believed
in
no
classes
or
anything
else
,
*NL*
excepting
``
the
woman
question
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
looked
likely
enough
,
and
was
accepted
as
fact
by
most
of
the
*NL*
inhabitants
of
the
place
,
especially
as
it
was
borne
out
,
more
or
less
,
*NL*
by
daily
occurrences
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
much
was
said
that
could
not
be
determined
absolutely
.
For
*NL*
instance
,
it
was
reported
that
the
poor
girl
had
so
loved
her
future
*NL*
husband
that
she
had
followed
him
to
the
house
of
the
other
woman
,
the
*NL*
day
after
she
had
been
thrown
over
;
others
said
that
he
had
insisted
on
*NL*
her
coming
,
himself
,
in
order
to
shame
and
insult
her
by
his
taunts
and
*NL*
Nihilistic
confessions
when
she
reached
the
house
.
However
all
*NL*
these
things
might
be
,
the
public
interest
in
the
matter
grew
*NL*
daily
,
especially
as
it
became
clear
that
the
scandalous
wedding
was
*NL*
undoubtedly
to
take
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
that
if
our
readers
were
to
ask
an
explanation
,
not
of
the
wild
*NL*
reports
about
the
prince
's
Nihilistic
opinions
,
but
simply
as
to
how
*NL*
such
a
marriage
could
possibly
satisfy
his
real
aspirations
,
or
as
to
*NL*
the
spiritual
condition
of
our
hero
at
this
time
,
we
confess
that
we
*NL*
should
have
great
difficulty
in
giving
the
required
information
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
we
know
is
,
that
the
marriage
really
was
arranged
,
and
that
the
*NL*
prince
had
commissioned
Lebedeff
and
Keller
to
look
after
all
the
*NL*
necessary
business
connected
with
it
;
that
he
had
requested
them
to
*NL*
spare
no
expense
;
that
Nastasia
herself
was
hurrying
on
the
wedding
;
*NL*
that
Keller
was
to
be
the
prince
's
best
man
,
at
his
own
earnest
request
;
*NL*
and
that
Burdovsky
was
to
give
Nastasia
away
,
to
his
great
delight
.
The
*NL*
wedding
was
to
take
place
before
the
middle
of
July
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
besides
the
above
,
we
are
cognizant
of
certain
other
undoubted
*NL*
facts
,
which
puzzle
us
a
good
deal
because
they
seem
flatly
to
*NL*
contradict
the
foregoing
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
suspect
,
for
instance
,
that
having
commissioned
Lebedeff
and
the
*NL*
others
,
as
above
,
the
prince
immediately
forgot
all
about
masters
of
*NL*
ceremonies
and
even
the
ceremony
itself
;
and
we
feel
quite
certain
that
*NL*
in
making
these
arrangements
he
did
so
in
order
that
he
might
absolutely
*NL*
escape
all
thought
of
the
wedding
,
and
even
forget
its
approach
if
he
*NL*
could
,
by
detailing
all
business
concerning
it
to
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
did
he
think
of
all
this
time
,
then
?
What
did
he
wish
for
?
There
is
*NL*
no
doubt
that
he
was
a
perfectly
free
agent
all
through
,
and
that
as
*NL*
far
as
Nastasia
was
concerned
,
there
was
no
force
of
any
kind
brought
*NL*
to
bear
on
him
.
Nastasia
wished
for
a
speedy
marriage
,
true
!
--
but
the
*NL*
prince
agreed
at
once
to
her
proposals
;
he
agreed
,
in
fact
,
so
casually
*NL*
that
anyone
might
suppose
he
was
but
acceding
to
the
most
simple
and
*NL*
ordinary
suggestion
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
many
strange
circumstances
such
as
this
before
us
;
but
in
*NL*
our
opinion
they
do
but
deepen
the
mystery
,
and
do
not
in
the
smallest
*NL*
degree
help
us
to
understand
the
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
let
us
take
one
more
example
.
Thus
,
we
know
for
a
fact
that
*NL*
during
the
whole
of
this
fortnight
the
prince
spent
all
his
days
and
*NL*
evenings
with
Nastasia
;
he
walked
with
her
,
drove
with
her
;
he
began
to
*NL*
be
restless
whenever
he
passed
an
hour
without
seeing
her
--
in
fact
,
*NL*
to
all
appearances
,
he
sincerely
loved
her
.
He
would
listen
to
her
for
*NL*
hours
at
a
time
with
a
quiet
smile
on
his
face
,
scarcely
saying
a
word
*NL*
himself
.
And
yet
we
know
,
equally
certainly
,
that
during
this
period
he
*NL*
several
times
set
off
,
suddenly
,
to
the
Epanchins
'
,
not
concealing
*NL*
the
fact
from
Nastasia
Philipovna
,
and
driving
the
latter
to
absolute
*NL*
despair
.
We
know
also
that
he
was
not
received
at
the
Epanchins
'
so
long
*NL*
as
they
remained
at
Pavlofsk
,
and
that
he
was
not
allowed
an
interview
*NL*
with
Aglaya
;
--
but
next
day
he
would
set
off
once
more
on
the
same
*NL*
errand
,
apparently
quite
oblivious
of
the
fact
of
yesterday
's
visit
*NL*
having
been
a
failure
,
--
and
,
of
course
,
meeting
with
another
refusal
.
*NL*
We
know
,
too
,
that
exactly
an
hour
after
Aglaya
had
fled
from
Nastasia
*NL*
Philipovna
's
house
on
that
fateful
evening
,
the
prince
was
at
the
*NL*
Epanchins
'
,
--
and
that
his
appearance
there
had
been
the
cause
of
the
*NL*
greatest
consternation
and
dismay
;
for
Aglaya
had
not
been
home
,
and
the
*NL*
family
only
discovered
then
,
for
the
first
time
,
that
the
two
of
them
*NL*
had
been
to
Nastasia
's
house
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
said
that
Elizabetha
Prokofievna
and
her
daughters
had
there
and
*NL*
then
denounced
the
prince
in
the
strongest
terms
,
and
had
refused
*NL*
any
further
acquaintance
and
friendship
with
him
;
their
rage
and
*NL*
denunciations
being
redoubled
when
Varia
Ardalionovna
suddenly
arrived
*NL*
and
stated
that
Aglaya
had
been
at
her
house
in
a
terrible
state
of
mind
*NL*
for
the
last
hour
,
and
that
she
refused
to
come
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
last
item
of
news
,
which
disturbed
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
more
than
*NL*
anything
else
,
was
perfectly
true
.
On
leaving
Nastasia
's
,
Aglaya
had
*NL*
felt
that
she
would
rather
die
than
face
her
people
,
and
had
therefore
*NL*
gone
straight
to
Nina
Alexandrovna
's
.
On
receiving
the
news
,
Lizabetha
*NL*
and
her
daughters
and
the
general
all
rushed
off
to
Aglaya
,
followed
*NL*
by
Prince
Lef
Nicolaievitch
--
undeterred
by
his
recent
dismissal
;
but
*NL*
through
Varia
he
was
refused
a
sight
of
Aglaya
here
also
.
The
end
of
the
*NL*
episode
was
that
when
Aglaya
saw
her
mother
and
sisters
crying
over
her
*NL*
and
not
uttering
a
word
of
reproach
,
she
had
flung
herself
into
their
*NL*
arms
and
gone
straight
home
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
said
that
Gania
managed
to
make
a
fool
of
himself
even
on
this
*NL*
occasion
;
for
,
finding
himself
alone
with
Aglaya
for
a
minute
or
two
*NL*
when
Varia
had
gone
to
the
Epanchins
'
,
he
had
thought
it
a
fitting
*NL*
opportunity
to
make
a
declaration
of
his
love
,
and
on
hearing
this
*NL*
Aglaya
,
in
spite
of
her
state
of
mind
at
the
time
,
had
suddenly
burst
*NL*
out
laughing
,
and
had
put
a
strange
question
to
him
.
She
asked
him
*NL*
whether
he
would
consent
to
hold
his
finger
to
a
lighted
candle
in
proof
*NL*
of
his
devotion
!
Gania
--
it
was
said
--
looked
so
comically
bewildered
that
*NL*
Aglaya
had
almost
laughed
herself
into
hysterics
,
and
had
rushed
out
of
*NL*
the
room
and
upstairs
,
--
where
her
parents
had
found
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hippolyte
told
the
prince
this
last
story
,
sending
for
him
on
purpose
.
*NL*
When
Muishkin
heard
about
the
candle
and
Gania
's
finger
he
had
laughed
*NL*
so
that
he
had
quite
astonished
Hippolyte
,
--
and
then
shuddered
and
burst
*NL*
into
tears
.
The
prince
's
condition
during
those
days
was
strange
and
*NL*
perturbed
.
Hippolyte
plainly
declared
that
he
thought
he
was
out
of
his
*NL*
mind
;
--
this
,
however
,
was
hardly
to
be
relied
upon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Offering
all
these
facts
to
our
readers
and
refusing
to
explain
them
,
*NL*
we
do
not
for
a
moment
desire
to
justify
our
hero
's
conduct
.
On
the
*NL*
contrary
,
we
are
quite
prepared
to
feel
our
share
of
the
indignation
*NL*
which
his
behaviour
aroused
in
the
hearts
of
his
friends
.
Even
Vera
*NL*
Lebedeff
was
angry
with
him
for
a
while
;
so
was
Colia
;
so
was
Keller
,
*NL*
until
he
was
selected
for
best
man
;
so
was
Lebedeff
himself
,
--
who
began
*NL*
to
intrigue
against
him
out
of
pure
irritation
;
--
but
of
this
anon
.
In
*NL*
fact
we
are
in
full
accord
with
certain
forcible
words
spoken
to
the
*NL*
prince
by
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
,
quite
unceremoniously
,
during
the
course
*NL*
of
a
friendly
conversation
,
six
or
seven
days
after
the
events
at
*NL*
Nastasia
Philipovna
's
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
may
remark
here
that
not
only
the
Epanchins
themselves
,
but
all
who
*NL*
had
anything
to
do
with
them
,
thought
it
right
to
break
with
the
prince
*NL*
in
consequence
of
his
conduct
.
Prince
S.
even
went
so
far
as
to
turn
*NL*
away
and
cut
him
dead
in
the
street
.
But
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
was
not
*NL*
afraid
to
compromise
himself
by
paying
the
prince
a
visit
,
and
did
so
,
*NL*
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
had
recommenced
to
visit
at
the
Epanchins
'
,
*NL*
where
he
was
received
with
redoubled
hospitality
and
kindness
after
the
*NL*
temporary
estrangement
.
*NL*
*NL*
Evgenie
called
upon
the
prince
the
day
after
that
on
which
the
Epanchins
*NL*
left
Pavlofsk
.
He
knew
of
all
the
current
rumours
,
--
in
fact
,
he
had
*NL*
probably
contributed
to
them
himself
.
The
prince
was
delighted
to
see
*NL*
him
,
and
immediately
began
to
speak
of
the
Epanchins
;
--
which
simple
and
*NL*
straightforward
opening
quite
took
Evgenie
's
fancy
,
so
that
he
melted
at
*NL*
once
,
and
plunged
in
medias
res
without
ceremony
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
did
not
know
,
up
to
this
,
that
the
Epanchins
had
left
the
*NL*
place
.
He
grew
very
pale
on
hearing
the
news
;
but
a
moment
later
he
*NL*
nodded
his
head
,
and
said
thoughtfully
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
it
was
bound
to
be
so
.
''
Then
he
added
quickly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
have
they
gone
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Evgenie
meanwhile
observed
him
attentively
,
and
the
rapidity
of
the
*NL*
questions
,
their
simplicity
,
the
prince
's
candour
,
and
at
the
same
*NL*
time
,
his
evident
perplexity
and
mental
agitation
,
surprised
him
*NL*
considerably
.
However
,
he
told
Muishkin
all
he
could
,
kindly
and
*NL*
in
detail
.
The
prince
hardly
knew
anything
,
for
this
was
the
first
*NL*
informant
from
the
household
whom
he
had
met
since
the
estrangement
.
*NL*
*NL*
Evgenie
reported
that
Aglaya
had
been
really
ill
,
and
that
for
two
*NL*
nights
she
had
not
slept
at
all
,
owing
to
high
fever
;
that
now
she
was
*NL*
better
and
out
of
serious
danger
,
but
still
in
a
nervous
,
hysterical
*NL*
state
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
good
thing
that
there
is
peace
in
the
house
,
at
all
events
,
''
he
*NL*
continued
.
``
They
never
utter
a
hint
about
the
past
,
not
only
in
Aglaya
's
*NL*
presence
,
but
even
among
themselves
.
The
old
people
are
talking
of
a
*NL*
trip
abroad
in
the
autumn
,
immediately
after
Adelaida
's
wedding
;
Aglaya
*NL*
received
the
news
in
silence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Evgenie
himself
was
very
likely
going
abroad
also
;
so
were
Prince
S.
*NL*
and
his
wife
,
if
affairs
allowed
of
it
;
the
general
was
to
stay
at
home
.
*NL*
They
were
all
at
their
estate
of
Colmina
now
,
about
twenty
miles
or
so
*NL*
from
St.
Petersburg
.
Princess
Bielokonski
had
not
returned
to
Moscow
*NL*
yet
,
and
was
apparently
staying
on
for
reasons
of
her
own
.
Lizabetha
*NL*
Prokofievna
had
insisted
that
it
was
quite
impossible
to
remain
in
*NL*
Pavlofsk
after
what
had
happened
.
Evgenie
had
told
her
of
all
the
*NL*
rumours
current
in
town
about
the
affair
;
so
that
there
could
be
no
talk
*NL*
of
their
going
to
their
house
on
the
Yelagin
as
yet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
in
point
of
fact
,
prince
,
''
added
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
,
``
you
must
*NL*
allow
that
they
could
hardly
have
stayed
here
,
considering
that
they
*NL*
knew
of
all
that
went
on
at
your
place
,
and
in
the
face
of
your
daily
*NL*
visits
to
their
house
,
visits
which
you
insisted
upon
making
in
spite
of
*NL*
their
refusal
to
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
yes
,
quite
so
;
you
are
quite
right
.
I
wished
to
see
Aglaya
*NL*
Ivanovna
,
you
know
!
''
said
the
prince
,
nodding
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
dear
fellow
,
''
cried
Evgenie
,
warmly
,
with
real
sorrow
in
his
*NL*
voice
,
``
how
could
you
permit
all
that
to
come
about
as
it
has
?
Of
*NL*
course
,
of
course
,
I
know
it
was
all
so
unexpected
.
I
admit
that
you
,
*NL*
only
naturally
,
lost
your
head
,
and
--
and
could
not
stop
the
foolish
*NL*
girl
;
that
was
not
in
your
power
.
I
quite
see
so
much
;
but
you
really
*NL*
should
have
understood
how
seriously
she
cared
for
you
.
She
could
not
*NL*
bear
to
share
you
with
another
;
and
you
could
bring
yourself
to
throw
*NL*
away
and
shatter
such
a
treasure
!
Oh
,
prince
,
prince
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
you
are
quite
right
again
,
''
said
the
poor
prince
,
in
anguish
*NL*
of
mind
.
``
I
was
wrong
,
I
know
.
But
it
was
only
Aglaya
who
looked
on
*NL*
Nastasia
Philipovna
so
;
no
one
else
did
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
that
's
just
the
worst
of
it
all
,
do
n't
you
see
,
that
there
was
*NL*
absolutely
nothing
serious
about
the
matter
in
reality
!
''
cried
Evgenie
,
*NL*
beside
himself
:
``
Excuse
me
,
prince
,
but
I
have
thought
over
all
this
;
I
*NL*
have
thought
a
great
deal
over
it
;
I
know
all
that
had
happened
before
;
*NL*
I
know
all
that
took
place
six
months
since
;
and
I
know
there
was
*NL*
_
nothing
_
serious
about
the
matter
,
it
was
but
fancy
,
smoke
,
fantasy
,
*NL*
distorted
by
agitation
,
and
only
the
alarmed
jealousy
of
an
absolutely
*NL*
inexperienced
girl
could
possibly
have
mistaken
it
for
serious
reality
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
quite
let
himself
go
,
and
gave
the
reins
to
his
*NL*
indignation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clearly
and
reasonably
,
and
with
great
psychological
insight
,
he
drew
a
*NL*
picture
of
the
prince
's
past
relations
with
Nastasia
Philipovna
.
*NL*
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
always
had
a
ready
tongue
,
but
on
this
occasion
his
*NL*
eloquence
,
surprised
himself
.
``
From
the
very
beginning
,
''
he
said
,
``
you
*NL*
began
with
a
lie
;
what
began
with
a
lie
was
bound
to
end
with
a
lie
;
*NL*
such
is
the
law
of
nature
.
I
do
not
agree
,
in
fact
I
am
angry
,
when
I
*NL*
hear
you
called
an
idiot
;
you
are
far
too
intelligent
to
deserve
such
*NL*
an
epithet
;
but
you
are
so
far
_
strange
_
as
to
be
unlike
others
;
that
you
*NL*
must
allow
,
yourself
.
Now
,
I
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
basis
*NL*
of
all
that
has
happened
,
has
been
first
of
all
your
innate
inexperience
*NL*
-LRB-
remark
the
expression
`
innate
,
'
prince
-RRB-
.
Then
follows
your
unheard-of
*NL*
simplicity
of
heart
;
then
comes
your
absolute
want
of
sense
of
*NL*
proportion
-LRB-
to
this
want
you
have
several
times
confessed
-RRB-
;
and
lastly
,
*NL*
a
mass
,
an
accumulation
,
of
intellectual
convictions
which
you
,
in
your
*NL*
unexampled
honesty
of
soul
,
accept
unquestionably
as
also
innate
and
*NL*
natural
and
true
.
Admit
,
prince
,
that
in
your
relations
with
Nastasia
*NL*
Philipovna
there
has
existed
,
from
the
very
first
,
something
democratic
,
*NL*
and
the
fascination
,
so
to
speak
,
of
the
`
woman
question
'
?
I
know
all
*NL*
about
that
scandalous
scene
at
Nastasia
Philipovna
's
house
when
Rogojin
*NL*
brought
the
money
,
six
months
ago
.
I
'll
show
you
yourself
as
in
a
*NL*
looking-glass
,
if
you
like
.
I
know
exactly
all
that
went
on
,
in
every
*NL*
detail
,
and
why
things
have
turned
out
as
they
have
.
You
thirsted
,
while
*NL*
in
Switzerland
,
for
your
home-country
,
for
Russia
;
you
read
,
doubtless
,
*NL*
many
books
about
Russia
,
excellent
books
,
I
dare
say
,
but
hurtful
to
*NL*
_
you
_
;
and
you
arrived
here
;
as
it
were
,
on
fire
with
the
longing
to
be
*NL*
of
service
.
Then
,
on
the
very
day
of
your
arrival
,
they
tell
you
a
sad
*NL*
story
of
an
ill-used
woman
;
they
tell
_
you
_
,
a
knight
,
pure
and
without
*NL*
reproach
,
this
tale
of
a
poor
woman
!
The
same
day
you
actually
_
see
_
*NL*
her
;
you
are
attracted
by
her
beauty
,
her
fantastic
,
almost
demoniacal
,
*NL*
beauty
--
-LRB-
I
admit
her
beauty
,
of
course
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Add
to
all
this
your
nervous
nature
,
your
epilepsy
,
and
your
sudden
*NL*
arrival
in
a
strange
town
--
the
day
of
meetings
and
of
exciting
scenes
,
*NL*
the
day
of
unexpected
acquaintanceships
,
the
day
of
sudden
actions
,
*NL*
the
day
of
meeting
with
the
three
lovely
Epanchin
girls
,
and
among
*NL*
them
Aglaya
--
add
your
fatigue
,
your
excitement
;
add
Nastasia
'
s
evening
*NL*
party
,
and
the
tone
of
that
party
,
and
--
what
were
you
to
expect
of
*NL*
yourself
at
such
a
moment
as
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
yes
!
''
said
the
prince
,
once
more
,
nodding
his
head
,
and
*NL*
blushing
slightly
.
``
Yes
,
it
was
so
,
or
nearly
so
--
I
know
it
.
And
*NL*
besides
,
you
see
,
I
had
not
slept
the
night
before
,
in
the
train
,
or
the
*NL*
night
before
that
,
either
,
and
I
was
very
tired
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
of
course
,
quite
so
;
that
's
what
I
am
driving
at
!
''
*NL*
continued
Evgenie
,
excitedly
.
``
It
is
as
clear
as
possible
,
and
most
*NL*
comprehensible
,
that
you
,
in
your
enthusiasm
,
should
plunge
headlong
*NL*
into
the
first
chance
that
came
of
publicly
airing
your
great
idea
that
*NL*
you
,
a
prince
,
and
a
pure-living
man
,
did
not
consider
a
woman
disgraced
*NL*
if
the
sin
were
not
her
own
,
but
that
of
a
disgusting
social
libertine
!
*NL*
Oh
,
heavens
!
it
's
comprehensible
enough
,
my
dear
prince
,
but
that
is
not
*NL*
the
question
,
unfortunately
!
The
question
is
,
was
there
any
reality
*NL*
and
truth
in
your
feelings
?
Was
it
nature
,
or
nothing
but
intellectual
*NL*
enthusiasm
?
What
do
you
think
yourself
?
We
are
told
,
of
course
,
that
a
*NL*
far
worse
woman
was
_
forgiven
_
,
but
we
do
n't
find
that
she
was
told
that
*NL*
she
had
done
well
,
or
that
she
was
worthy
of
honour
and
respect
!
Did
not
*NL*
your
common-sense
show
you
what
was
the
real
state
of
the
case
,
a
few
*NL*
months
later
?
The
question
is
now
,
not
whether
she
is
an
innocent
woman
*NL*
-LRB-
I
do
not
insist
one
way
or
the
other
--
I
do
not
wish
to
-RRB-
;
but
can
her
*NL*
whole
career
justify
such
intolerable
pride
,
such
insolent
,
rapacious
*NL*
egotism
as
she
has
shown
?
Forgive
me
,
I
am
too
violent
,
perhaps
,
but
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
I
dare
say
it
is
all
as
you
say
;
I
dare
say
you
are
quite
right
,
''
*NL*
muttered
the
prince
once
more
.
``
She
is
very
sensitive
and
easily
put
*NL*
out
,
of
course
;
but
still
,
she
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
worthy
of
sympathy
?
Is
that
what
you
wished
to
say
,
my
good
*NL*
fellow
?
But
then
,
for
the
mere
sake
of
vindicating
her
worthiness
of
*NL*
sympathy
,
you
should
not
have
insulted
and
offended
a
noble
and
generous
*NL*
girl
in
her
presence
!
This
is
a
terrible
exaggeration
of
sympathy
!
How
*NL*
can
you
love
a
girl
,
and
yet
so
humiliate
her
as
to
throw
her
over
for
*NL*
the
sake
of
another
woman
,
before
the
very
eyes
of
that
other
woman
,
*NL*
when
you
have
already
made
her
a
formal
proposal
of
marriage

And
you
*NL*
_
did
_
propose
to
her
,
you
know
;
you
did
so
before
her
parents
and
sisters
.
*NL*
Can
you
be
an
honest
man
,
prince
,
if
you
act
so
?
I
ask
you
!
And
did
you
*NL*
not
deceive
that
beautiful
girl
when
you
assured
her
of
your
love
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
are
quite
right
.
Oh
!
I
feel
that
I
am
very
guilty
!
''
said
*NL*
Muishkin
,
in
deepest
distress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
as
if
that
is
enough

cried
Evgenie

indignantly
.
``
As

it

enough
simply
to
say

I
know
I
am
very
guilty

You
are
to
blame
,
and
*NL*
yet
you
persevere
in
evil-doing

Where
was
your
heart

I
should
like
to
*NL*
know

your

christian
heart

all
that

at

You
saw
her
face

was
she
suffering
*NL*
less
than
the
other

How

you
see
her
suffering

allow

to
continue

How

you
?

*NL*
*NL*
``

I

the
wretched
prince

To

I

happened

I

I
ran
after
Aglaya
Ivanovna
,

Nastasia
Philipovna
fell
*NL*
down
in
a
faint
;
and

day
they

*NL*

everything

He
pulled
at

coat-sleeve
nervously

rose
from

lowered
his

mysteriously

he
said
this

just

soon

really
_
all

Because
she
must
know
_
all
_

that
's
*NL*
the
first
condition
towards
understanding

Why
can
not
we
ever
know
all
*NL*
about
another
,
especially
when
that

has
been
guilty

But
I

do

know
what
I

I

pained

so

dreadfully

Surely
--
surely
Aglaya
has
not
the

expression
now

*NL*
she
had
at
the
moment
when
she
ran
away

Oh

yes

I
am
guilty

I

I
know
it

Probably
I
am
in
fault
all
round

I
do
n't
quite
know

how

I
am
in
fault

no

There
is
something
else

but
I
can
not
*NL*
explain
it
to
you

Evgenie
Pavlovitch

I
have
no
words

Aglaya
will

understand

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

loved

not
like
an
abstract
spirit

Do
you
know
what
,
my
poor

The
most
probable
explanation
of
the

is
that

*NL*
And
so
they
parted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
left
the
house
with
strange
convictions

He
,
too
,
*NL*
felt
that
the
prince
must
be
out
of
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
did
he
mean
by
that
_
face

a
face
which
he
so
fears

*NL*
so
loves
?
And
meanwhile
he
really
may
die
,
as
he
says
,
without
seeing
*NL*
Aglaya
,
and
she
will
never
know
how
devotedly
he
loves
her
!
Ha
,
ha

ha

*NL*
How
does
the
fellow
manage
to
love
two
of
them
?
Two
different
kinds
of
*NL*
love
,
I
suppose
!
This
is
very
interesting
--
poor
idiot
!
What
on
earth
*NL*
will
become
of
him
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
X
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
did
not
die
before
his
wedding
--
either
by
day
or
night
,
as
*NL*
he
had
foretold
that
he
might
.
Very
probably
he
passed
disturbed
nights
,
*NL*
and
was
afflicted
with
bad
dreams
;
but
,
during
the
daytime
,
among
his
*NL*
fellow-men
,
he
seemed
as
kind
as
ever
,
and
even
contented
;
only
a
little
*NL*
thoughtful
when
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
wedding
was
hurried
on
.
The
day
was
fixed
for
exactly
a
week
after
*NL*
Evgenie
's
visit
to
the
prince
.
In
the
face
of
such
haste
as
this
,
*NL*
even
the
prince
's
best
friends
-LRB-
if
he
had
had
any
-RRB-
would
have
felt
the
*NL*
hopelessness
of
any
attempt
to
save
``
the
poor
madman
.
''
Rumour
said
that
*NL*
in
the
visit
of
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
was
to
be
discerned
the
influence
of
*NL*
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
and
her
husband
...
But
if
those
good
souls
,
in
*NL*
the
boundless
kindness
of
their
hearts
,
were
desirous
of
saving
the
*NL*
eccentric
young
fellow
from
ruin
,
they
were
unable
to
take
any
stronger
*NL*
measures
to
attain
that
end
.
Neither
their
position
,
nor
their
private
*NL*
inclination
,
perhaps
-LRB-
and
only
naturally
-RRB-
,
would
allow
them
to
use
any
*NL*
more
pronounced
means
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
observed
before
that
even
some
of
the
prince
's
nearest
*NL*
neighbours
had
begun
to
oppose
him
.
Vera
Lebedeff
's
passive
disagreement
*NL*
was
limited
to
the
shedding
of
a
few
solitary
tears
;
to
more
frequent
*NL*
sitting
alone
at
home
,
and
to
a
diminished
frequency
in
her
visits
to
*NL*
the
prince
's
apartments
.
*NL*
*NL*
Colia
was
occupied
with
his
father
at
this
time
.
The
old
man
died
during
*NL*
a
second
stroke
,
which
took
place
just
eight
days
after
the
first
.
The
*NL*
prince
showed
great
sympathy
in
the
grief
of
the
family
,
and
during
the
*NL*
first
days
of
their
mourning
he
was
at
the
house
a
great
deal
with
Nina
*NL*
Alexandrovna
.
He
went
to
the
funeral
,
and
it
was
observable
that
the
*NL*
public
assembled
in
church
greeted
his
arrival
and
departure
with
*NL*
whisperings
,
and
watched
him
closely
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
same
thing
happened
in
the
park
and
in
the
street
,
wherever
he
went
.
*NL*
He
was
pointed
out
when
he
drove
by
,
and
he
often
overheard
the
name
of
*NL*
Nastasia
Philipovna
coupled
with
his
own
as
he
passed
.
People
looked
*NL*
out
for
her
at
the
funeral
,
too
,
but
she
was
not
there
;
and
another
*NL*
conspicuous
absentee
was
the
captain
's
widow
,
whom
Lebedeff
had
*NL*
prevented
from
coming
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
funeral
service
produced
a
great
effect
on
the
prince
.
He
whispered
*NL*
to
Lebedeff
that
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever
heard
a
Russian
*NL*
funeral
service
since
he
was
a
little
boy
.
Observing
that
he
was
looking
*NL*
about
him
uneasily
,
Lebedeff
asked
him
whom
he
was
seeking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
.
I
only
thought
I
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
Rogojin
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
--
is
he
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
he
's
in
church
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
I
caught
sight
of
his
eyes
!
''
muttered
the
prince
,
in
*NL*
confusion
.
``
But
what
of
it
!
--
Why
is
he
here
?
Was
he
asked
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dear
,
no
!
Why
,
they
do
n't
even
know
him
!
Anyone
can
come
in
,
you
*NL*
know
.
Why
do
you
look
so
amazed
?
I
often
meet
him
;
I
've
seen
him
at
*NL*
least
four
times
,
here
at
Pavlofsk
,
within
the
last
week
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
seen
him
once
--
since
that
day
!
''
the
prince
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Nastasia
Philipovna
had
not
said
a
word
about
having
met
Rogojin
*NL*
since
``
that
day
,
''
the
prince
concluded
that
the
latter
had
his
own
*NL*
reasons
for
wishing
to
keep
out
of
sight
.
All
the
day
of
the
funeral
our
*NL*
hero
was
in
a
deeply
thoughtful
state
,
while
Nastasia
Philipovna
was
*NL*
particularly
merry
,
both
in
the
daytime
and
in
the
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
Colia
had
made
it
up
with
the
prince
before
his
father
's
death
,
and
it
*NL*
was
he
who
urged
him
to
make
use
of
Keller
and
Burdovsky
,
promising
*NL*
to
answer
himself
for
the
former
's
behaviour
.
Nina
Alexandrovna
and
*NL*
Lebedeff
tried
to
persuade
him
to
have
the
wedding
in
St.
Petersburg
,
*NL*
instead
of
in
the
public
fashion
contemplated
,
down
here
at
Pavlofsk
*NL*
in
the
height
of
the
season
.
But
the
prince
only
said
that
Nastasia
*NL*
Philipovna
desired
to
have
it
so
,
though
he
saw
well
enough
what
*NL*
prompted
their
arguments
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
Keller
came
to
visit
the
prince
.
He
was
in
a
high
state
of
*NL*
delight
with
the
post
of
honour
assigned
to
him
at
the
wedding
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
entering
he
stopped
on
the
threshold
,
raised
his
hand
as
if
*NL*
making
a
solemn
vow
,
and
cried
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
drink
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
went
up
to
the
prince
,
seized
both
his
hands
,
shook
them
warmly
,
*NL*
and
declared
that
he
had
at
first
felt
hostile
towards
the
project
of
*NL*
this
marriage
,
and
had
openly
said
so
in
the
billiard-rooms
,
but
that
*NL*
the
reason
simply
was
that
,
with
the
impatience
of
a
friend
,
he
had
*NL*
hoped
to
see
the
prince
marry
at
least
a
Princess
de
Rohan
or
de
Chabot
;
*NL*
but
that
now
he
saw
that
the
prince
's
way
of
thinking
was
ten
times
more
*NL*
noble
than
that
of
``
all
the
rest
put
together
.
''
For
he
desired
neither
*NL*
pomp
nor
wealth
nor
honour
,
but
only
the
truth
!
The
sympathies
of
*NL*
exalted
personages
were
well
known
,
and
the
prince
was
too
highly
*NL*
placed
by
his
education
,
and
so
on
,
not
to
be
in
some
sense
an
exalted
*NL*
personage
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
all
the
common
herd
judge
differently
;
in
the
town
,
at
*NL*
the
meetings
,
in
the
villas
,
at
the
band
,
in
the
inns
and
the
*NL*
billiard-rooms
,
the
coming
event
has
only
to
be
mentioned
and
there
are
*NL*
shouts
and
cries
from
everybody
.
I
have
even
heard
talk
of
getting
up
a
*NL*
`
charivari
'
under
the
windows
on
the
wedding-night
.
So
if
`
you
have
need
*NL*
of
the
pistol
'
of
an
honest
man
,
prince
,
I
am
ready
to
fire
half
a
dozen
*NL*
shots
even
before
you
rise
from
your
nuptial
couch
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Keller
also
advised
,
in
anticipation
of
the
crowd
making
a
rush
after
*NL*
the
ceremony
,
that
a
fire-hose
should
be
placed
at
the
entrance
to
the
*NL*
house
;
but
Lebedeff
was
opposed
to
this
measure
,
which
he
said
might
*NL*
result
in
the
place
being
pulled
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
assure
you
,
prince
,
that
Lebedeff
is
intriguing
against
you
.
He
wants
*NL*
to
put
you
under
control
.
Imagine
that
!
To
take
`
from
you
the
use
of
*NL*
your
free-will
and
your
money
--
that
'
is
to
say
,
the
two
things
that
*NL*
distinguish
us
from
the
animals
!
I
have
heard
it
said
positively
.
It
is
*NL*
the
sober
truth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
recollected
that
somebody
had
told
him
something
of
the
kind
*NL*
before
,
and
he
had
,
of
course
,
scoffed
at
it
.
He
only
laughed
now
,
and
*NL*
forgot
the
hint
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lebedeff
really
had
been
busy
for
some
little
while
;
but
,
as
usual
,
his
*NL*
plans
had
become
too
complex
to
succeed
,
through
sheer
excess
of
ardour
.
*NL*
When
he
came
to
the
prince
--
the
very
day
before
the
wedding
--
to
confess
*NL*
-LRB-
for
he
always
confessed
to
the
persons
against
whom
he
intrigued
,
*NL*
especially
when
the
plan
failed
-RRB-
,
he
informed
our
hero
that
he
himself
*NL*
was
a
born
Talleyrand
,
but
for
some
unknown
reason
had
become
simple
*NL*
Lebedeff
.
He
then
proceeded
to
explain
his
whole
game
to
the
prince
,
*NL*
interesting
the
latter
exceedingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
According
to
Lebedeff
's
account
,
he
had
first
tried
what
he
could
do
*NL*
with
General
Epanchin
.
The
latter
informed
him
that
he
wished
well
to
*NL*
the
unfortunate
young
man
,
and
would
gladly
do
what
he
could
to
``
save
*NL*
him
,
''
but
that
he
did
not
think
it
would
be
seemly
for
him
to
interfere
*NL*
in
this
matter
.
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
would
neither
hear
nor
see
him
.
*NL*
Prince
S.
and
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
only
shrugged
their
shoulders
,
and
*NL*
implied
that
it
was
no
business
of
theirs
.
However
,
Lebedeff
had
not
*NL*
lost
heart
,
and
went
off
to
a
clever
lawyer
,
--
a
worthy
and
respectable
*NL*
man
,
whom
he
knew
well
.
This
old
gentleman
informed
him
that
the
thing
*NL*
was
perfectly
feasible
if
he
could
get
hold
of
competent
witnesses
as
*NL*
to
Muishkin
's
mental
incapacity
.
Then
,
with
the
assistance
of
a
few
*NL*
influential
persons
,
he
would
soon
see
the
matter
arranged
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lebedeff
immediately
procured
the
services
of
an
old
doctor
,
and
carried
*NL*
the
latter
away
to
Pavlofsk
to
see
the
prince
,
by
way
of
viewing
the
*NL*
ground
,
as
it
were
,
and
to
give
him
-LRB-
Lebedeff
-RRB-
counsel
as
to
whether
*NL*
the
thing
was
to
be
done
or
not
.
The
visit
was
not
to
be
official
,
but
*NL*
merely
friendly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Muishkin
remembered
the
doctor
's
visit
quite
well
.
He
remembered
that
*NL*
Lebedeff
had
said
that
he
looked
ill
,
and
had
better
see
a
doctor
;
and
*NL*
although
the
prince
scouted
the
idea
,
Lebedeff
had
turned
up
almost
*NL*
immediately
with
his
old
friend
,
explaining
that
they
had
just
met
at
*NL*
the
bedside
of
Hippolyte
,
who
was
very
ill
,
and
that
the
doctor
had
*NL*
something
to
tell
the
prince
about
the
sick
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
had
,
of
course
,
at
once
received
him
,
and
had
plunged
into
*NL*
a
conversation
about
Hippolyte
.
He
had
given
the
doctor
an
account
of
*NL*
Hippolyte
's
attempted
suicide
;
and
had
proceeded
thereafter
to
talk
of
*NL*
his
own
malady
,
--
of
Switzerland
,
of
Schneider
,
and
so
on
;
and
so
*NL*
deeply
was
the
old
man
interested
by
the
prince
's
conversation
and
his
*NL*
description
of
Schneider
's
system
,
that
he
sat
on
for
two
hours
.
*NL*
*NL*
Muishkin
gave
him
excellent
cigars
to
smoke
,
and
Lebedeff
,
for
his
part
,
*NL*
regaled
him
with
liqueurs
,
brought
in
by
Vera
,
to
whom
the
doctor
--
a
*NL*
married
man
and
the
father
of
a
family
--
addressed
such
compliments
that
*NL*
she
was
filled
with
indignation
.
They
parted
friends
,
and
,
after
leaving
*NL*
the
prince
,
the
doctor
said
to
Lebedeff
:
``
If
all
such
people
were
put
*NL*
under
restraint
,
there
would
be
no
one
left
for
keepers
.
''
Lebedeff
then
,
*NL*
in
tragic
tones
,
told
of
the
approaching
marriage
,
whereupon
the
other
*NL*
nodded
his
head
and
replied
that
,
after
all
,
marriages
like
that
were
*NL*
not
so
rare
;
that
he
had
heard
that
the
lady
was
very
fascinating
and
of
*NL*
extraordinary
beauty
,
which
was
enough
to
explain
the
infatuation
of
a
*NL*
wealthy
man
;
that
,
further
,
thanks
to
the
liberality
of
Totski
and
of
*NL*
Rogojin
,
she
possessed
--
so
he
had
heard
--
not
only
money
,
but
pearls
,
*NL*
diamonds
,
shawls
,
and
furniture
,
and
consequently
she
could
not
be
*NL*
considered
a
bad
match
.
In
brief
,
it
seemed
to
the
doctor
that
the
*NL*
prince
's
choice
,
far
from
being
a
sign
of
foolishness
,
denoted
,
on
the
*NL*
contrary
,
a
shrewd
,
calculating
,
and
practical
mind
.
Lebedeff
had
been
*NL*
much
struck
by
this
point
of
view
,
and
he
terminated
his
confession
*NL*
by
assuring
the
prince
that
he
was
ready
,
if
need
be
,
to
shed
his
very
*NL*
life
's
blood
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hippolyte
,
too
,
was
a
source
of
some
distraction
to
the
prince
at
this
*NL*
time
;
he
would
send
for
him
at
any
and
every
hour
of
the
day
.
They
*NL*
lived
,
--
Hippolyte
and
his
mother
and
the
children
,
--
in
a
small
house
not
*NL*
far
off
,
and
the
little
ones
were
happy
,
if
only
because
they
were
able
*NL*
to
escape
from
the
invalid
into
the
garden
.
The
prince
had
enough
to
do
*NL*
in
keeping
the
peace
between
the
irritable
Hippolyte
and
his
mother
,
and
*NL*
eventually
the
former
became
so
malicious
and
sarcastic
on
the
subject
*NL*
of
the
approaching
wedding
,
that
Muishkin
took
offence
at
last
,
and
*NL*
refused
to
continue
his
visits
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
couple
of
days
later
,
however
,
Hippolyte
's
mother
came
with
tears
in
*NL*
her
eyes
,
and
begged
the
prince
to
come
back
,
``
or
_
he
_
would
eat
her
up
*NL*
bodily
.
''
She
added
that
Hippolyte
had
a
great
secret
to
disclose
.
Of
*NL*
course
the
prince
went
.
There
was
no
secret
,
however
,
unless
we
reckon
*NL*
certain
pantings
and
agitated
glances
around
-LRB-
probably
all
put
on
-RRB-
as
*NL*
the
invalid
begged
his
visitor
to
``
beware
of
Rogojin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
the
sort
of
man
,
''
he
continued
,
``
who
wo
n't
give
up
his
object
,
*NL*
you
know
;
he
is
not
like
you
and
me
,
prince
--
he
belongs
to
quite
a
*NL*
different
order
of
beings
.
If
he
sets
his
heart
on
a
thing
he
wo
n't
be
*NL*
afraid
of
anything
--
''
and
so
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hippolyte
was
very
ill
,
and
looked
as
though
he
could
not
long
survive
.
*NL*
He
was
tearful
at
first
,
but
grew
more
and
more
sarcastic
and
malicious
*NL*
as
the
interview
proceeded
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
questioned
him
in
detail
as
to
his
hints
about
Rogojin
.
He
*NL*
was
anxious
to
seize
upon
some
facts
which
might
confirm
Hippolyte
's
*NL*
vague
warnings
;
but
there
were
none
;
only
Hippolyte
's
own
private
*NL*
impressions
and
feelings
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
the
invalid
--
to
his
immense
satisfaction
--
ended
by
seriously
*NL*
alarming
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
Muishkin
had
not
cared
to
make
any
reply
to
his
sundry
*NL*
questions
,
and
only
smiled
in
response
to
Hippolyte
's
advice
to
``
run
for
*NL*
his
life
--
abroad
,
if
necessary
.
There
are
Russian
priests
everywhere
,
*NL*
and
one
can
get
married
all
over
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
Hippolyte
's
last
idea
which
upset
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
I
am
really
alarmed
about
,
though
,
''
he
said
,
``
is
Aglaya
Ivanovna
.
*NL*
Rogojin
knows
how
you
love
her
.
Love
for
love
.
You
took
Nastasia
*NL*
Philipovna
from
him
.
He
will
murder
Aglaya
Ivanovna
;
for
though
she
is
*NL*
not
yours
,
of
course
,
now
,
still
such
an
act
would
pain
you
,
--
would
n't
*NL*
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
attained
his
end
.
The
prince
left
the
house
beside
himself
with
*NL*
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
warnings
about
Rogojin
were
expressed
on
the
day
before
the
*NL*
wedding
.
That
evening
the
prince
saw
Nastasia
Philipovna
for
the
last
*NL*
time
before
they
were
to
meet
at
the
altar
;
but
Nastasia
was
not
in
a
*NL*
position
to
give
him
any
comfort
or
consolation
.
On
the
contrary
,
she
*NL*
only
added
to
his
mental
perturbation
as
the
evening
went
on
.
Up
to
this
*NL*
time
she
had
invariably
done
her
best
to
cheer
him
--
she
was
afraid
of
*NL*
his
looking
melancholy
;
she
would
try
singing
to
him
,
and
telling
him
*NL*
every
sort
of
funny
story
or
reminiscence
that
she
could
recall
.
The
*NL*
prince
nearly
always
pretended
to
be
amused
,
whether
he
were
so
*NL*
actually
or
no
;
but
often
enough
he
laughed
sincerely
,
delighted
by
the
*NL*
brilliancy
of
her
wit
when
she
was
carried
away
by
her
narrative
,
as
she
*NL*
very
often
was
.
Nastasia
would
be
wild
with
joy
to
see
the
impression
*NL*
she
had
made
,
and
to
hear
his
laugh
of
real
amusement
;
and
she
would
*NL*
remain
the
whole
evening
in
a
state
of
pride
and
happiness
.
But
this
*NL*
evening
her
melancholy
and
thoughtfulness
grew
with
every
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
had
told
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
with
perfect
sincerity
that
he
*NL*
loved
Nastasia
Philipovna
with
all
his
soul
.
In
his
love
for
her
there
*NL*
was
the
sort
of
tenderness
one
feels
for
a
sick
,
unhappy
child
which
*NL*
can
not
be
left
alone
.
He
never
spoke
of
his
feelings
for
Nastasia
*NL*
to
anyone
,
not
even
to
herself
.
When
they
were
together
they
never
*NL*
discussed
their
``
feelings
,
''
and
there
was
nothing
in
their
cheerful
,
*NL*
animated
conversation
which
an
outsider
could
not
have
heard
.
Daria
*NL*
Alexeyevna
,
with
whom
Nastasia
was
staying
,
told
afterwards
how
she
had
*NL*
been
filled
with
joy
and
delight
only
to
look
at
them
,
all
this
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thanks
to
the
manner
in
which
he
regarded
Nastasia
's
mental
and
moral
*NL*
condition
,
the
prince
was
to
some
extent
freed
from
other
perplexities
.
*NL*
She
was
now
quite
different
from
the
woman
he
had
known
three
months
*NL*
before
.
He
was
not
astonished
,
for
instance
,
to
see
her
now
so
impatient
*NL*
to
marry
him
--
she
who
formerly
had
wept
with
rage
and
hurled
curses
and
*NL*
reproaches
at
him
if
he
mentioned
marriage
!
``
It
shows
that
she
no
longer
*NL*
fears
,
as
she
did
then
,
that
she
would
make
me
unhappy
by
marrying
me
,
''
*NL*
he
thought
.
And
he
felt
sure
that
so
sudden
a
change
could
not
be
a
*NL*
natural
one
.
This
rapid
growth
of
self-confidence
could
not
be
due
only
*NL*
to
her
hatred
for
Aglaya
.
To
suppose
that
would
be
to
suspect
the
depth
*NL*
of
her
feelings
.
Nor
could
it
arise
from
dread
of
the
fate
that
awaited
*NL*
her
if
she
married
Rogojin
.
These
causes
,
indeed
,
as
well
as
others
,
*NL*
might
have
played
a
part
in
it
,
but
the
true
reason
,
Muishkin
decided
,
*NL*
was
the
one
he
had
long
suspected
--
that
the
poor
sick
soul
had
come
to
*NL*
the
end
of
its
forces
.
Yet
this
was
an
explanation
that
did
not
procure
*NL*
him
any
peace
of
mind
.
At
times
he
seemed
to
be
making
violent
efforts
*NL*
to
think
of
nothing
,
and
one
would
have
said
that
he
looked
on
his
*NL*
marriage
as
an
unimportant
formality
,
and
on
his
future
happiness
as
a
*NL*
thing
not
worth
considering
.
As
to
conversations
such
as
the
one
held
*NL*
with
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
,
he
avoided
them
as
far
as
possible
,
feeling
*NL*
that
there
were
certain
objections
to
which
he
could
make
no
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
had
observed
that
Nastasia
knew
well
enough
what
Aglaya
was
*NL*
to
him
.
He
never
spoke
of
it
,
but
he
had
seen
her
face
when
she
had
*NL*
caught
him
starting
off
for
the
Epanchins
'
house
on
several
occasions
.
*NL*
When
the
Epanchins
left
Pavlofsk
,
she
had
beamed
with
radiance
and
*NL*
happiness
.
Unsuspicious
and
unobservant
as
he
was
,
he
had
feared
at
that
*NL*
time
that
Nastasia
might
have
some
scheme
in
her
mind
for
a
scene
or
*NL*
scandal
which
would
drive
Aglaya
out
of
Pavlofsk
.
She
had
encouraged
*NL*
the
rumours
and
excitement
among
the
inhabitants
of
the
place
as
to
her
*NL*
marriage
with
the
prince
,
in
order
to
annoy
her
rival
;
and
,
finding
*NL*
it
difficult
to
meet
the
Epanchins
anywhere
,
she
had
,
on
one
occasion
,
*NL*
taken
him
for
a
drive
past
their
house
.
He
did
not
observe
what
was
*NL*
happening
until
they
were
almost
passing
the
windows
,
when
it
was
too
*NL*
late
to
do
anything
.
He
said
nothing
,
but
for
two
days
afterwards
he
was
*NL*
ill
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nastasia
did
not
try
that
particular
experiment
again
.
A
few
days
before
*NL*
that
fixed
for
the
wedding
,
she
grew
grave
and
thoughtful
.
She
always
*NL*
ended
by
getting
the
better
of
her
melancholy
,
and
becoming
merry
and
*NL*
cheerful
again
,
but
not
quite
so
unaffectedly
happy
as
she
had
been
some
*NL*
days
earlier
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
redoubled
his
attentive
study
of
her
symptoms
.
It
was
a
most
*NL*
curious
circumstance
,
in
his
opinion
,
that
she
never
spoke
of
Rogojin
.
*NL*
But
once
,
about
five
days
before
the
wedding
,
when
the
prince
was
at
*NL*
home
,
a
messenger
arrived
begging
him
to
come
at
once
,
as
Nastasia
*NL*
Philipovna
was
very
ill
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
found
her
in
a
condition
approaching
to
absolute
madness
.
She
*NL*
screamed
,
and
trembled
,
and
cried
out
that
Rogojin
was
hiding
out
there
*NL*
in
the
garden
--
that
she
had
seen
him
herself
--
and
that
he
would
murder
*NL*
her
in
the
night
--
that
he
would
cut
her
throat
.
She
was
terribly
*NL*
agitated
all
day
.
But
it
so
happened
that
the
prince
called
at
*NL*
Hippolyte
's
house
later
on
,
and
heard
from
his
mother
that
she
had
been
*NL*
in
town
all
day
,
and
had
there
received
a
visit
from
Rogojin
,
who
had
*NL*
made
inquiries
about
Pavlofsk
.
On
inquiry
,
it
turned
out
that
Rogojin
*NL*
visited
the
old
lady
in
town
at
almost
the
same
moment
when
Nastasia
*NL*
declared
that
she
had
seen
him
in
the
garden
;
so
that
the
whole
thing
*NL*
turned
out
to
be
an
illusion
on
her
part
.
Nastasia
immediately
went
*NL*
across
to
Hippolyte
's
to
inquire
more
accurately
,
and
returned
immensely
*NL*
relieved
and
comforted
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
day
before
the
wedding
,
the
prince
left
Nastasia
in
a
state
of
*NL*
great
animation
.
Her
wedding-dress
and
all
sorts
of
finery
had
just
*NL*
arrived
from
town
.
Muishkin
had
not
imagined
that
she
would
be
so
*NL*
excited
over
it
,
but
he
praised
everything
,
and
his
praise
rendered
her
*NL*
doubly
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Nastasia
could
not
hide
the
cause
of
her
intense
interest
in
her
*NL*
wedding
splendour
.
She
had
heard
of
the
indignation
in
the
town
,
and
*NL*
knew
that
some
of
the
populace
was
getting
up
a
sort
of
charivari
with
*NL*
music
,
that
verses
had
been
composed
for
the
occasion
,
and
that
the
*NL*
rest
of
Pavlofsk
society
more
or
less
encouraged
these
preparations
.
So
,
*NL*
since
attempts
were
being
made
to
humiliate
her
,
she
wanted
to
hold
her
*NL*
head
even
higher
than
usual
,
and
to
overwhelm
them
all
with
the
beauty
*NL*
and
taste
of
her
toilette
.
``
Let
them
shout
and
whistle
,
if
they
dare
!
''
*NL*
Her
eyes
flashed
at
the
thought
.
But
,
underneath
this
,
she
had
another
*NL*
motive
,
of
which
she
did
not
speak
.
She
thought
that
possibly
Aglaya
,
*NL*
or
at
any
rate
someone
sent
by
her
,
would
be
present
incognito
at
*NL*
the
ceremony
,
or
in
the
crowd
,
and
she
wished
to
be
prepared
for
this
*NL*
eventuality
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
left
her
at
eleven
,
full
of
these
thoughts
,
and
went
home
.
*NL*
But
it
was
not
twelve
o'clock
when
a
messenger
came
to
say
that
Nastasia
*NL*
was
very
bad
,
and
he
must
come
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
hurrying
back
he
found
his
bride
locked
up
in
her
own
room
and
could
*NL*
hear
her
hysterical
cries
and
sobs
.
It
was
some
time
before
she
could
be
*NL*
made
to
hear
that
the
prince
had
come
,
and
then
she
opened
the
door
only
*NL*
just
sufficiently
to
let
him
in
,
and
immediately
locked
it
behind
him
.
*NL*
She
then
fell
on
her
knees
at
his
feet
.
-LRB-
So
at
least
Dana
Alexeyevna
*NL*
reported
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
am
I
doing
?
What
am
I
doing
to
you
?
''
she
sobbed
convulsively
,
*NL*
embracing
his
knees
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
was
a
whole
hour
soothing
and
comforting
her
,
and
left
her
,
*NL*
at
length
,
pacified
and
composed
.
He
sent
another
messenger
during
the
*NL*
night
to
inquire
after
her
,
and
two
more
next
morning
.
The
last
*NL*
brought
back
a
message
that
Nastasia
was
surrounded
by
a
whole
army
of
*NL*
dressmakers
and
maids
,
and
was
as
happy
and
as
busy
as
such
a
beauty
*NL*
should
be
on
her
wedding
morning
,
and
that
there
was
not
a
vestige
of
*NL*
yesterday
's
agitation
remaining
.
The
message
concluded
with
the
*NL*
news
that
at
the
moment
of
the
bearer
's
departure
there
was
a
great
*NL*
confabulation
in
progress
as
to
which
diamonds
were
to
be
worn
,
and
how
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
message
entirely
calmed
the
prince
's
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
following
report
of
the
proceedings
on
the
wedding
day
may
be
*NL*
depended
upon
,
as
coming
from
eye-witnesses
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
wedding
was
fixed
for
eight
o'clock
in
the
evening
.
Nastasia
*NL*
Philipovna
was
ready
at
seven
.
From
six
o'clock
groups
of
people
began
*NL*
to
gather
at
Nastasia
's
house
,
at
the
prince
's
,
and
at
the
church
door
,
*NL*
but
more
especially
at
the
former
place
.
The
church
began
to
fill
at
*NL*
seven
.
*NL*
*NL*
Colia
and
Vera
Lebedeff
were
very
anxious
on
the
prince
's
account
,
but
*NL*
they
were
so
busy
over
the
arrangements
for
receiving
the
guests
after
*NL*
the
wedding
,
that
they
had
not
much
time
for
the
indulgence
of
personal
*NL*
feelings
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
to
be
very
few
guests
besides
the
best
men
and
so
on
;
only
*NL*
Dana
Alexeyevna
,
the
Ptitsins
,
Gania
,
and
the
doctor
.
When
the
prince
*NL*
asked
Lebedeff
why
he
had
invited
the
doctor
,
who
was
almost
a
stranger
,
*NL*
Lebedeff
replied
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
he
wears
an
`
order
,
'
and
it
looks
so
well
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
idea
amused
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
Keller
and
Burdovsky
looked
wonderfully
correct
in
their
dress-coats
and
*NL*
white
kid
gloves
,
although
Keller
caused
the
bridegroom
some
alarm
by
*NL*
his
undisguisedly
hostile
glances
at
the
gathering
crowd
of
sight-seers
*NL*
outside
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
about
half-past
seven
the
prince
started
for
the
church
in
his
*NL*
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
may
remark
here
that
he
seemed
anxious
not
to
omit
a
single
one
of
*NL*
the
recognized
customs
and
traditions
observed
at
weddings
.
He
wished
*NL*
all
to
be
done
as
openly
as
possible
,
and
``
in
due
order
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Arrived
at
the
church
,
Muishkin
,
under
Keller
's
guidance
,
passed
*NL*
through
the
crowd
of
spectators
,
amid
continuous
whispering
and
excited
*NL*
exclamations
.
The
prince
stayed
near
the
altar
,
while
Keller
made
off
*NL*
once
more
to
fetch
the
bride
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
reaching
the
gate
of
Daria
Alexeyevna
's
house
,
Keller
found
a
far
*NL*
denser
crowd
than
he
had
encountered
at
the
prince
's
.
The
remarks
and
*NL*
exclamations
of
the
spectators
here
were
of
so
irritating
a
nature
that
*NL*
Keller
was
very
near
making
them
a
speech
on
the
impropriety
of
their
*NL*
conduct
,
but
was
luckily
caught
by
Burdovsky
,
in
the
act
of
turning
to
*NL*
address
them
,
and
hurried
indoors
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nastasia
Philipovna
was
ready
.
She
rose
from
her
seat
,
looked
into
the
*NL*
glass
and
remarked
,
as
Keller
told
the
tale
afterwards
,
that
she
was
``
as
*NL*
pale
as
a
corpse
.
''
She
then
bent
her
head
reverently
,
before
the
ikon
in
*NL*
the
corner
,
and
left
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
torrent
of
voices
greeted
her
appearance
at
the
front
door
.
The
crowd
*NL*
whistled
,
clapped
its
hands
,
and
laughed
and
shouted
;
but
in
a
moment
or
*NL*
two
isolated
voices
were
distinguishable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
beauty
!
''
cried
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
she
is
n't
the
first
in
the
world
,
nor
the
last
,
''
said
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marriage
covers
everything
,
''
observed
a
third
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
defy
you
to
find
another
beauty
like
that
,
''
said
a
fourth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
a
real
princess
!
I
'd
sell
my
soul
for
such
a
princess
as
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nastasia
came
out
of
the
house
looking
as
white
as
any
handkerchief
;
but
*NL*
her
large
dark
eyes
shone
upon
the
vulgar
crowd
like
blazing
coals
.
*NL*
The
spectators
'
cries
were
redoubled
,
and
became
more
exultant
and
*NL*
triumphant
every
moment
.
The
door
of
the
carriage
was
open
,
and
Keller
*NL*
had
given
his
hand
to
the
bride
to
help
her
in
,
when
suddenly
with
*NL*
a
loud
cry
she
rushed
from
him
,
straight
into
the
surging
crowd
.
Her
*NL*
friends
about
her
were
stupefied
with
amazement
;
the
crowd
parted
as
she
*NL*
rushed
through
it
,
and
suddenly
,
at
a
distance
of
five
or
six
yards
*NL*
from
the
carriage
,
appeared
Rogojin
.
It
was
his
look
that
had
caught
her
*NL*
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nastasia
rushed
to
him
like
a
madwoman
,
and
seized
both
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Save
me
!
''
she
cried
.
``
Take
me
away
,
anywhere
you
like
,
quick
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rogojin
seized
her
in
his
arms
and
almost
carried
her
to
the
carriage
.
*NL*
Then
,
in
a
flash
,
he
tore
a
hundred-rouble
note
out
of
his
pocket
and
*NL*
held
it
to
the
coachman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
station
,
quick
!
If
you
catch
the
train
you
shall
have
another
.
*NL*
Quick
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
leaped
into
the
carriage
after
Nastasia
and
banged
the
door
.
The
*NL*
coachman
did
not
hesitate
a
moment
;
he
whipped
up
the
horses
,
and
they
*NL*
were
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
more
second
and
I
should
have
stopped
him
,
''
said
Keller
,
*NL*
afterwards
.
In
fact
,
he
and
Burdovsky
jumped
into
another
carriage
and
*NL*
set
off
in
pursuit
;
but
it
struck
them
as
they
drove
along
that
it
was
*NL*
not
much
use
trying
to
bring
Nastasia
back
by
force
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Besides
,
''
said
Burdovsky
,
``
the
prince
would
not
like
it
,
would
he
?
''
So
*NL*
they
gave
up
the
pursuit
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rogojin
and
Nastasia
Philipovna
reached
the
station
just
in
time
for
the
*NL*
train
.
As
he
jumped
out
of
the
carriage
and
was
almost
on
the
point
*NL*
of
entering
the
train
,
Rogojin
accosted
a
young
girl
standing
on
the
*NL*
platform
and
wearing
an
old-fashioned
,
but
respectable-looking
,
black
*NL*
cloak
and
a
silk
handkerchief
over
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
fifty
roubles
for
your
cloak
?
''
he
shouted
,
holding
the
money
*NL*
out
to
the
girl
.
Before
the
astonished
young
woman
could
collect
her
*NL*
scattered
senses
,
he
pushed
the
money
into
her
hand
,
seized
the
mantle
,
*NL*
and
threw
it
and
the
handkerchief
over
Nastasia
's
head
and
shoulders
.
*NL*
The
latter
's
wedding-array
would
have
attracted
too
much
attention
,
and
*NL*
it
was
not
until
some
time
later
that
the
girl
understood
why
her
old
*NL*
cloak
and
kerchief
had
been
bought
at
such
a
price
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
news
of
what
had
happened
reached
the
church
with
extraordinary
*NL*
rapidity
.
When
Keller
arrived
,
a
host
of
people
whom
he
did
not
know
*NL*
thronged
around
to
ask
him
questions
.
There
was
much
excited
talking
,
*NL*
and
shaking
of
heads
,
even
some
laughter
;
but
no
one
left
the
church
,
*NL*
all
being
anxious
to
observe
how
the
now
celebrated
bridegroom
would
*NL*
take
the
news
.
He
grew
very
pale
upon
hearing
it
,
but
took
it
quite
*NL*
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
afraid
,
''
he
muttered
,
scarcely
audibly
,
``
but
I
hardly
thought
it
*NL*
would
come
to
this
.
''
Then
after
a
short
silence
,
he
added
:
``
However
,
in
*NL*
her
state
,
it
is
quite
consistent
with
the
natural
order
of
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Even
Keller
admitted
afterwards
that
this
was
``
extraordinarily
*NL*
philosophical
''
on
the
prince
's
part
.
He
left
the
church
quite
calm
,
to
*NL*
all
appearances
,
as
many
witnesses
were
found
to
declare
afterwards
.
He
*NL*
seemed
anxious
to
reach
home
and
be
left
alone
as
quickly
as
possible
;
*NL*
but
this
was
not
to
be
.
He
was
accompanied
by
nearly
all
the
invited
*NL*
guests
,
and
besides
this
,
the
house
was
almost
besieged
by
excited
bands
*NL*
of
people
,
who
insisted
upon
being
allowed
to
enter
the
verandah
.
The
*NL*
prince
heard
Keller
and
Lebedeff
remonstrating
and
quarrelling
with
*NL*
these
unknown
individuals
,
and
soon
went
out
himself
.
He
approached
*NL*
the
disturbers
of
his
peace
,
requested
courteously
to
be
told
what
was
*NL*
desired
;
then
politely
putting
Lebedeff
and
Keller
aside
,
he
addressed
*NL*
an
old
gentleman
who
was
standing
on
the
verandah
steps
at
the
head
of
*NL*
the
band
of
would-be
guests
,
and
courteously
requested
him
to
honour
him
*NL*
with
a
visit
.
The
old
fellow
was
quite
taken
aback
by
this
,
but
entered
,
*NL*
followed
by
a
few
more
,
who
tried
to
appear
at
their
ease
.
The
rest
*NL*
remained
outside
,
and
presently
the
whole
crowd
was
censuring
those
who
*NL*
had
accepted
the
invitation
.
The
prince
offered
seats
to
his
strange
*NL*
visitors
,
tea
was
served
,
and
a
general
conversation
sprang
up
.
*NL*
Everything
was
done
most
decorously
,
to
the
considerable
surprise
of
the
*NL*
intruders
.
A
few
tentative
attempts
were
made
to
turn
the
conversation
*NL*
to
the
events
of
the
day
,
and
a
few
indiscreet
questions
were
asked
;
but
*NL*
Muishkin
replied
to
everybody
with
such
simplicity
and
good-humour
,
and
*NL*
at
the
same
time
with
so
much
dignity
,
and
showed
such
confidence
in
the
*NL*
good
breeding
of
his
guests
,
that
the
indiscreet
talkers
were
quickly
*NL*
silenced
.
By
degrees
the
conversation
became
almost
serious
.
One
*NL*
gentleman
suddenly
exclaimed
,
with
great
vehemence
:
``
Whatever
happens
,
*NL*
I
shall
not
sell
my
property
;
I
shall
wait
.
Enterprise
is
better
than
*NL*
money
,
and
there
,
sir
,
you
have
my
whole
system
of
economy
,
if
you
*NL*
wish
!
''
He
addressed
the
prince
,
who
warmly
commended
his
sentiments
,
*NL*
though
Lebedeff
whispered
in
his
ear
that
this
gentleman
,
who
talked
so
*NL*
much
of
his
``
property
,
''
had
never
had
either
house
or
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nearly
an
hour
passed
thus
,
and
when
tea
was
over
the
visitors
seemed
to
*NL*
think
that
it
was
time
to
go
.
As
they
went
out
,
the
doctor
and
the
old
*NL*
gentleman
bade
Muishkin
a
warm
farewell
,
and
all
the
rest
took
their
*NL*
leave
with
hearty
protestations
of
good-will
,
dropping
remarks
to
the
*NL*
effect
that
``
it
was
no
use
worrying
,
''
and
that
``
perhaps
all
would
turn
*NL*
out
for
the
best
,
''
and
so
on
.
Some
of
the
younger
intruders
would
have
*NL*
asked
for
champagne
,
but
they
were
checked
by
the
older
ones
.
When
all
*NL*
had
departed
,
Keller
leaned
over
to
Lebedeff
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
you
and
me
there
would
have
been
a
scene
.
We
should
have
shouted
*NL*
and
fought
,
and
called
in
the
police
.
But
he
has
simply
made
some
new
*NL*
friends
--
and
such
friends
,
too
!
I
know
them
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lebedeff
,
who
was
slightly
intoxicated
,
answered
with
a
sigh
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Things
are
hidden
from
the
wise
and
prudent
,
and
revealed
unto
babes
.
*NL*
I
have
applied
those
words
to
him
before
,
but
now
I
add
that
God
has
*NL*
preserved
the
babe
himself
from
the
abyss
,
He
and
all
His
saints
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
about
half-past
ten
,
the
prince
was
left
alone
.
His
head
ached
.
*NL*
Colia
was
the
last
to
go
,
after
having
helped
him
to
change
his
wedding
*NL*
clothes
.
They
parted
on
affectionate
terms
,
and
,
without
speaking
of
*NL*
what
had
happened
,
Colia
promised
to
come
very
early
the
next
day
.
He
*NL*
said
later
that
the
prince
had
given
no
hint
of
his
intentions
when
they
*NL*
said
good-bye
,
but
had
hidden
them
even
from
him
.
Soon
there
was
hardly
*NL*
anyone
left
in
the
house
.
Burdovsky
had
gone
to
see
Hippolyte
;
Keller
*NL*
and
Lebedeff
had
wandered
off
together
somewhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
Vera
Lebedeff
remained
hurriedly
rearranging
the
furniture
in
*NL*
the
rooms
.
As
she
left
the
verandah
,
she
glanced
at
the
prince
.
He
was
*NL*
seated
at
the
table
,
with
both
elbows
upon
it
,
and
his
head
resting
*NL*
on
his
hands
.
She
approached
him
,
and
touched
his
shoulder
gently
.
*NL*
The
prince
started
and
looked
at
her
in
perplexity
;
he
seemed
to
be
*NL*
collecting
his
senses
for
a
minute
or
so
,
before
he
could
remember
where
*NL*
he
was
.
As
recollection
dawned
upon
him
,
he
became
violently
agitated
.
*NL*
All
he
did
,
however
,
was
to
ask
Vera
very
earnestly
to
knock
at
his
door
*NL*
and
awake
him
in
time
for
the
first
train
to
Petersburg
next
morning
.
*NL*
Vera
promised
,
and
the
prince
entreated
her
not
to
tell
anyone
of
his
*NL*
intention
.
She
promised
this
,
too
;
and
at
last
,
when
she
had
half-closed
*NL*
the
door
,
he
called
her
back
a
third
time
,
took
her
hands
in
his
,
kissed
*NL*
them
,
then
kissed
her
forehead
,
and
in
a
rather
peculiar
manner
said
to
*NL*
her
,
``
Until
tomorrow
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
Vera
's
story
afterwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
away
in
great
anxiety
about
him
,
but
when
she
saw
him
in
the
*NL*
morning
,
he
seemed
to
be
quite
himself
again
,
greeted
her
with
a
smile
,
*NL*
and
told
her
that
he
would
very
likely
be
back
by
the
evening
.
It
*NL*
appears
that
he
did
not
consider
it
necessary
to
inform
anyone
excepting
*NL*
Vera
of
his
departure
for
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
XI
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
hour
later
he
was
in
St.
Petersburg
,
and
by
ten
o'clock
he
had
rung
*NL*
the
bell
at
Rogojin
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
gone
to
the
front
door
,
and
was
kept
waiting
a
long
while
before
*NL*
anyone
came
.
At
last
the
door
of
old
Mrs.
Rogojin
's
flat
was
opened
,
and
*NL*
an
aged
servant
appeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Parfen
Semionovitch
is
not
at
home
,
''
she
announced
from
the
doorway
.
*NL*
``
Whom
do
you
want
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Parfen
Semionovitch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
not
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
woman
examined
the
prince
from
head
to
foot
with
great
*NL*
curiosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
all
events
tell
me
whether
he
slept
at
home
last
night
,
and
whether
*NL*
he
came
alone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
woman
continued
to
stare
at
him
,
but
said
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
not
Nastasia
Philipovna
here
with
him
,
yesterday
evening
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
,
pray
,
who
are
you
yourself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Prince
Lef
Nicolaievitch
Muishkin
;
he
knows
me
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
not
at
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
lowered
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Nastasia
Philipovna
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
nothing
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
a
minute
!
When
will
he
come
back
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
that
either
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
was
shut
with
these
words
,
and
the
old
woman
disappeared
.
The
*NL*
prince
decided
to
come
back
within
an
hour
.
Passing
out
of
the
house
,
he
*NL*
met
the
porter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Parfen
Semionovitch
at
home
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
they
tell
me
he
was
not
at
home
,
then
?
''
``
Where
did
they
tell
*NL*
you
so
,
--
at
his
door
?
''
``
No
,
at
his
mother
's
flat
;
I
rang
at
Parfen
*NL*
Semionovitch
's
door
and
nobody
came
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
he
may
have
gone
out
.
I
ca
n't
tell
.
Sometimes
he
takes
the
keys
*NL*
with
him
,
and
leaves
the
rooms
empty
for
two
or
three
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
for
certain
that
he
was
at
home
last
night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
he
was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
Nastasia
Philipovna
with
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
;
she
does
n't
come
often
.
I
think
I
should
have
known
if
*NL*
she
had
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
went
out
deep
in
thought
,
and
walked
up
and
down
the
pavement
*NL*
for
some
time
.
The
windows
of
all
the
rooms
occupied
by
Rogojin
were
*NL*
closed
,
those
of
his
mother
's
apartments
were
open
.
It
was
a
hot
,
bright
*NL*
day
.
The
prince
crossed
the
road
in
order
to
have
a
good
look
at
the
*NL*
windows
again
;
not
only
were
Rogojin
's
closed
,
but
the
white
blinds
were
*NL*
all
down
as
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
there
for
a
minute
and
then
,
suddenly
and
strangely
enough
,
it
*NL*
seemed
to
him
that
a
little
corner
of
one
of
the
blinds
was
lifted
,
*NL*
and
Rogojin
's
face
appeared
for
an
instant
and
then
vanished
.
He
waited
*NL*
another
minute
,
and
decided
to
go
and
ring
the
bell
once
more
;
however
,
*NL*
he
thought
better
of
it
again
and
put
it
off
for
an
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
chief
object
in
his
mind
at
this
moment
was
to
get
as
quickly
as
*NL*
he
could
to
Nastasia
Philipovna
's
lodging
.
He
remembered
that
,
not
long
*NL*
since
,
when
she
had
left
Pavlofsk
at
his
request
,
he
had
begged
her
*NL*
to
put
up
in
town
at
the
house
of
a
respectable
widow
,
who
had
*NL*
well-furnished
rooms
to
let
,
near
the
Ismailofsky
barracks
.
Probably
*NL*
Nastasia
had
kept
the
rooms
when
she
came
down
to
Pavlofsk
this
last
*NL*
time
;
and
most
likely
she
would
have
spent
the
night
in
them
,
Rogojin
*NL*
having
taken
her
straight
there
from
the
station
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
took
a
droshky
.
It
struck
him
as
he
drove
on
that
he
ought
*NL*
to
have
begun
by
coming
here
,
since
it
was
most
improbable
that
Rogojin
*NL*
should
have
taken
Nastasia
to
his
own
house
last
night
.
He
remembered
*NL*
that
the
porter
said
she
very
rarely
came
at
all
,
so
that
it
was
still
*NL*
less
likely
that
she
would
have
gone
there
so
late
at
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vainly
trying
to
comfort
himself
with
these
reflections
,
the
prince
*NL*
reached
the
Ismailofsky
barracks
more
dead
than
alive
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
his
consternation
the
good
people
at
the
lodgings
had
not
only
heard
*NL*
nothing
of
Nastasia
,
but
all
came
out
to
look
at
him
as
if
he
were
a
*NL*
marvel
of
some
sort
.
The
whole
family
,
of
all
ages
,
surrounded
him
,
and
*NL*
he
was
begged
to
enter
.
He
guessed
at
once
that
they
knew
perfectly
well
*NL*
who
he
was
,
and
that
yesterday
ought
to
have
been
his
wedding-day
;
and
*NL*
further
that
they
were
dying
to
ask
about
the
wedding
,
and
especially
*NL*
about
why
he
should
be
here
now
,
inquiring
for
the
woman
who
in
all
*NL*
reasonable
human
probability
might
have
been
expected
to
be
with
him
in
*NL*
Pavlofsk
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
satisfied
their
curiosity
,
in
as
few
words
as
possible
,
with
regard
*NL*
to
the
wedding
,
but
their
exclamations
and
sighs
were
so
numerous
and
*NL*
sincere
that
he
was
obliged
to
tell
the
whole
story
--
in
a
short
form
,
*NL*
of
course
.
The
advice
of
all
these
agitated
ladies
was
that
the
prince
*NL*
should
go
at
once
and
knock
at
Rogojin
's
until
he
was
let
in
:
and
when
*NL*
let
in
insist
upon
a
substantial
explanation
of
everything
.
If
Rogojin
*NL*
was
really
not
at
home
,
the
prince
was
advised
to
go
to
a
certain
house
,
*NL*
the
address
of
which
was
given
,
where
lived
a
German
lady
,
a
friend
of
*NL*
Nastasia
Philipovna
's
.
It
was
possible
that
she
might
have
spent
the
*NL*
night
there
in
her
anxiety
to
conceal
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
rose
from
his
seat
in
a
condition
of
mental
collapse
.
The
*NL*
good
ladies
reported
afterwards
that
``
his
pallor
was
terrible
to
see
,
*NL*
and
his
legs
seemed
to
give
way
underneath
him
.
''
With
difficulty
he
was
*NL*
made
to
understand
that
his
new
friends
would
be
glad
of
his
address
,
in
*NL*
order
to
act
with
him
if
possible
.
After
a
moment
's
thought
he
gave
the
*NL*
address
of
the
small
hotel
,
on
the
stairs
of
which
he
had
had
a
fit
some
*NL*
five
weeks
since
.
He
then
set
off
once
more
for
Rogojin
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
time
they
neither
opened
the
door
at
Rogojin
's
flat
nor
at
the
one
*NL*
opposite
.
The
prince
found
the
porter
with
difficulty
,
but
when
found
,
*NL*
the
man
would
hardly
look
at
him
or
answer
his
questions
,
pretending
*NL*
to
be
busy
.
Eventually
,
however
,
he
was
persuaded
to
reply
so
far
as
to
*NL*
state
that
Rogojin
had
left
the
house
early
in
the
morning
and
gone
to
*NL*
Pavlofsk
,
and
that
he
would
not
return
today
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
wait
;
he
may
come
back
this
evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
may
not
be
home
for
a
week
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
at
all
events
,
he
_
did
_
sleep
here
,
did
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
he
did
sleep
here
,
yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
was
suspicious
and
unsatisfactory
.
Very
likely
the
porter
had
*NL*
received
new
instructions
during
the
interval
of
the
prince
's
absence
;
*NL*
his
manner
was
so
different
now
.
He
had
been
obliging
--
now
he
was
as
*NL*
obstinate
and
silent
as
a
mule
.
However
,
the
prince
decided
to
call
*NL*
again
in
a
couple
of
hours
,
and
after
that
to
watch
the
house
,
in
case
*NL*
of
need
.
His
hope
was
that
he
might
yet
find
Nastasia
at
the
address
*NL*
which
he
had
just
received
.
To
that
address
he
now
set
off
at
full
*NL*
speed
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
alas
!
at
the
German
lady
's
house
they
did
not
even
appear
to
*NL*
understand
what
he
wanted
.
After
a
while
,
by
means
of
certain
hints
,
he
*NL*
was
able
to
gather
that
Nastasia
must
have
had
a
quarrel
with
her
friend
*NL*
two
or
three
weeks
ago
,
since
which
date
the
latter
had
neither
heard
*NL*
nor
seen
anything
of
her
.
He
was
given
to
understand
that
the
subject
of
*NL*
Nastasia
's
present
whereabouts
was
not
of
the
slightest
interest
to
her
;
*NL*
and
that
Nastasia
might
marry
all
the
princes
in
the
world
for
all
she
*NL*
cared
!
So
Muishkin
took
his
leave
hurriedly
.
It
struck
him
now
that
she
*NL*
might
have
gone
away
to
Moscow
just
as
she
had
done
the
last
time
,
and
*NL*
that
Rogojin
had
perhaps
gone
after
her
,
or
even
_
with
_
her
.
If
only
he
*NL*
could
find
some
trace
!
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
he
must
take
his
room
at
the
hotel
;
and
he
started
off
in
that
*NL*
direction
.
Having
engaged
his
room
,
he
was
asked
by
the
waiter
whether
*NL*
he
would
take
dinner
;
replying
mechanically
in
the
affirmative
,
he
sat
*NL*
down
and
waited
;
but
it
was
not
long
before
it
struck
him
that
dining
*NL*
would
delay
him
.
Enraged
at
this
idea
,
he
started
up
,
crossed
the
*NL*
dark
passage
-LRB-
which
filled
him
with
horrible
impressions
and
gloomy
*NL*
forebodings
-RRB-
,
and
set
out
once
more
for
Rogojin
's
.
Rogojin
had
not
*NL*
returned
,
and
no
one
came
to
the
door
.
He
rang
at
the
old
lady
's
door
*NL*
opposite
,
and
was
informed
that
Parfen
Semionovitch
would
not
return
for
*NL*
three
days
.
The
curiosity
with
which
the
old
servant
stared
at
him
again
*NL*
impressed
the
prince
disagreeably
.
He
could
not
find
the
porter
this
*NL*
time
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
before
,
he
crossed
the
street
and
watched
the
windows
from
the
other
*NL*
side
,
walking
up
and
down
in
anguish
of
soul
for
half
an
hour
or
so
in
*NL*
the
stifling
heat
.
Nothing
stirred
;
the
blinds
were
motionless
;
indeed
,
*NL*
the
prince
began
to
think
that
the
apparition
of
Rogojin
's
face
could
*NL*
have
been
nothing
but
fancy
.
Soothed
by
this
thought
,
he
drove
off
once
*NL*
more
to
his
friends
at
the
Ismailofsky
barracks
.
He
was
expected
*NL*
there
.
The
mother
had
already
been
to
three
or
four
places
to
look
for
*NL*
Nastasia
,
but
had
not
found
a
trace
of
any
kind
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
said
nothing
,
but
entered
the
room
,
sat
down
silently
,
and
*NL*
stared
at
them
,
one
after
the
other
,
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
can
not
*NL*
understand
what
is
being
said
to
him
.
It
was
strange
--
one
moment
he
*NL*
seemed
to
be
so
observant
,
the
next
so
absent
;
his
behaviour
struck
*NL*
all
the
family
as
most
remarkable
.
At
length
he
rose
from
his
seat
,
and
*NL*
begged
to
be
shown
Nastasia
's
rooms
.
The
ladies
reported
afterwards
how
*NL*
he
had
examined
everything
in
the
apartments
.
He
observed
an
open
book
*NL*
on
the
table
,
Madam
Bovary
,
and
requested
the
leave
of
the
lady
of
the
*NL*
house
to
take
it
with
him
.
He
had
turned
down
the
leaf
at
the
open
page
,
*NL*
and
pocketed
it
before
they
could
explain
that
it
was
a
library
book
.
He
*NL*
had
then
seated
himself
by
the
open
window
,
and
seeing
a
card-table
,
he
*NL*
asked
who
played
cards
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
informed
that
Nastasia
used
to
play
with
Rogojin
every
evening
,
*NL*
either
at
``
preference
''
or
``
little
fool
,
''
or
``
whist
''
;
that
this
had
been
*NL*
their
practice
since
her
last
return
from
Pavlofsk
;
that
she
had
taken
*NL*
to
this
amusement
because
she
did
not
like
to
see
Rogojin
sitting
silent
*NL*
and
dull
for
whole
evenings
at
a
time
;
that
the
day
after
Nastasia
had
*NL*
made
a
remark
to
this
effect
,
Rogojin
had
whipped
a
pack
of
cards
out
*NL*
of
his
pocket
.
Nastasia
had
laughed
,
but
soon
they
began
playing
.
The
*NL*
prince
asked
where
were
the
cards
,
but
was
told
that
Rogojin
used
to
*NL*
bring
a
new
pack
every
day
,
and
always
carried
it
away
in
his
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
good
ladies
recommended
the
prince
to
try
knocking
at
Rogojin
's
once
*NL*
more
--
not
at
once
,
but
in
the
evening
.
Meanwhile
,
the
mother
would
go
to
*NL*
Pavlofsk
to
inquire
at
Dana
Alexeyevna
's
whether
anything
had
been
heard
*NL*
of
Nastasia
there
.
The
prince
was
to
come
back
at
ten
o'clock
and
meet
*NL*
her
,
to
hear
her
news
and
arrange
plans
for
the
morrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
the
kindly-meant
consolations
of
his
new
friends
,
the
prince
*NL*
walked
to
his
hotel
in
inexpressible
anguish
of
spirit
,
through
the
hot
,
*NL*
dusty
streets
,
aimlessly
staring
at
the
faces
of
those
who
passed
him
.
*NL*
Arrived
at
his
destination
,
he
determined
to
rest
awhile
in
his
room
*NL*
before
he
started
for
Rogojin
's
once
more
.
He
sat
down
,
rested
his
*NL*
elbows
on
the
table
and
his
head
on
his
hands
,
and
fell
to
thinking
.
*NL*
*NL*
Heaven
knows
how
long
and
upon
what
subjects
he
thought
.
He
thought
*NL*
of
many
things
--
of
Vera
Lebedeff
,
and
of
her
father
;
of
Hippolyte
;
of
*NL*
Rogojin
himself
,
first
at
the
funeral
,
then
as
he
had
met
him
in
the
*NL*
park
,
then
,
suddenly
,
as
they
had
met
in
this
very
passage
,
outside
,
*NL*
when
Rogojin
had
watched
in
the
darkness
and
awaited
him
with
uplifted
*NL*
knife
.
The
prince
remembered
his
enemy
's
eyes
as
they
had
glared
at
him
*NL*
in
the
darkness
.
He
shuddered
,
as
a
sudden
idea
struck
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
idea
was
,
that
if
Rogojin
were
in
Petersburg
,
though
he
might
hide
*NL*
for
a
time
,
yet
he
was
quite
sure
to
come
to
him
--
the
prince
--
before
*NL*
long
,
with
either
good
or
evil
intentions
,
but
probably
with
the
same
*NL*
intention
as
on
that
other
occasion
.
At
all
events
,
if
Rogojin
were
to
*NL*
come
at
all
he
would
be
sure
to
seek
the
prince
here
--
he
had
no
other
*NL*
town
address
--
perhaps
in
this
same
corridor
;
he
might
well
seek
him
here
*NL*
if
he
needed
him
.
And
perhaps
he
did
need
him
.
This
idea
seemed
quite
*NL*
natural
to
the
prince
,
though
he
could
not
have
explained
why
he
should
*NL*
so
suddenly
have
become
necessary
to
Rogojin
.
Rogojin
would
not
come
if
*NL*
all
were
well
with
him
,
that
was
part
of
the
thought
;
he
would
come
if
*NL*
all
were
not
well
;
and
certainly
,
undoubtedly
,
all
would
not
be
well
*NL*
with
him
.
The
prince
could
not
bear
this
new
idea
;
he
took
his
hat
and
*NL*
rushed
out
towards
the
street
.
It
was
almost
dark
in
the
passage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
if
he
were
to
come
out
of
that
corner
as
I
go
by
and
--
and
stop
*NL*
me
?
''
thought
the
prince
,
as
he
approached
the
familiar
spot
.
But
no
one
*NL*
came
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
passed
under
the
gateway
and
into
the
street
.
The
crowds
of
people
*NL*
walking
about
--
as
is
always
the
case
at
sunset
in
Petersburg
,
during
the
*NL*
summer
--
surprised
him
,
but
he
walked
on
in
the
direction
of
Rogojin
's
*NL*
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
fifty
yards
from
the
hotel
,
at
the
first
cross-road
,
as
he
passed
*NL*
through
the
crowd
of
foot-passengers
sauntering
along
,
someone
touched
*NL*
his
shoulder
,
and
said
in
a
whisper
into
his
ear
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lef
Nicolaievitch
,
my
friend
,
come
along
with
me
.
''
It
was
Rogojin
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
immediately
began
to
tell
him
,
eagerly
and
joyfully
,
how
he
*NL*
had
but
the
moment
before
expected
to
see
him
in
the
dark
passage
of
the
*NL*
hotel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
there
,
''
said
Rogojin
,
unexpectedly
.
``
Come
along
.
''
The
prince
was
*NL*
surprised
at
this
answer
;
but
his
astonishment
increased
a
couple
of
*NL*
minutes
afterwards
,
when
he
began
to
consider
it
.
Having
thought
it
*NL*
over
,
he
glanced
at
Rogojin
in
alarm
.
The
latter
was
striding
along
a
*NL*
yard
or
so
ahead
,
looking
straight
in
front
of
him
,
and
mechanically
*NL*
making
way
for
anyone
he
met
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
you
not
ask
for
me
at
my
room
if
you
were
in
the
hotel
?
''
asked
*NL*
the
prince
,
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rogojin
stopped
and
looked
at
him
;
then
reflected
,
and
replied
as
though
*NL*
he
had
not
heard
the
question
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
,
Lef
Nicolaievitch
,
you
go
straight
on
to
the
house
;
I
shall
*NL*
walk
on
the
other
side
.
See
that
we
keep
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
Rogojin
crossed
the
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arrived
on
the
opposite
pavement
,
he
looked
back
to
see
whether
the
*NL*
prince
were
moving
,
waved
his
hand
in
the
direction
of
the
Gorohovaya
,
*NL*
and
strode
on
,
looking
across
every
moment
to
see
whether
Muishkin
*NL*
understood
his
instructions
.
The
prince
supposed
that
Rogojin
desired
to
*NL*
look
out
for
someone
whom
he
was
afraid
to
miss
;
but
if
so
,
why
had
he
*NL*
not
told
_
him
_
whom
to
look
out
for
?
So
the
two
proceeded
for
half
a
mile
*NL*
or
so
.
Suddenly
the
prince
began
to
tremble
from
some
unknown
cause
.
He
*NL*
could
not
bear
it
,
and
signalled
to
Rogojin
across
the
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
came
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Nastasia
Philipovna
at
your
house
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
was
it
you
looked
out
of
the
window
under
the
blind
this
morning
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
did
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
prince
could
not
finish
his
question
;
he
did
not
know
what
to
*NL*
say
.
Besides
this
,
his
heart
was
beating
so
that
he
found
it
difficult
*NL*
to
speak
at
all
.
Rogojin
was
silent
also
and
looked
at
him
as
before
,
*NL*
with
an
expression
of
deep
thoughtfulness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'm
going
,
''
he
said
,
at
last
,
preparing
to
recross
the
road
.
``
You
*NL*
go
along
here
as
before
;
we
will
keep
to
different
sides
of
the
road
;
*NL*
it
's
better
so
,
you
'll
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
reached
the
Gorohovaya
,
and
came
near
the
house
,
the
prince
's
*NL*
legs
were
trembling
so
that
he
could
hardly
walk
.
It
was
about
ten
*NL*
o'clock
.
The
old
lady
's
windows
were
open
,
as
before
;
Rogojin
's
were
*NL*
all
shut
,
and
in
the
darkness
the
white
blinds
showed
whiter
than
ever
.
*NL*
Rogojin
and
the
prince
each
approached
the
house
on
his
respective
side
*NL*
of
the
road
;
Rogojin
,
who
was
on
the
near
side
,
beckoned
the
prince
*NL*
across
.
He
went
over
to
the
doorway
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Even
the
porter
does
not
know
that
I
have
come
home
now
.
I
told
him
,
*NL*
and
told
them
at
my
mother
's
too
,
that
I
was
off
to
Pavlofsk
,
''
said
*NL*
Rogojin
,
with
a
cunning
and
almost
satisfied
smile
.
``
We
'll
go
in
quietly
*NL*
and
nobody
will
hear
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
the
key
in
his
hand
.
Mounting
the
staircase
he
turned
and
*NL*
signalled
to
the
prince
to
go
more
softly
;
he
opened
the
door
very
*NL*
quietly
,
let
the
prince
in
,
followed
him
,
locked
the
door
behind
him
,
*NL*
and
put
the
key
in
his
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
along
,
''
he
whispered
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
spoken
in
a
whisper
all
the
way
.
In
spite
of
his
apparent
outward
*NL*
composure
,
he
was
evidently
in
a
state
of
great
mental
agitation
.
*NL*
Arrived
in
a
large
salon
,
next
to
the
study
,
he
went
to
the
window
and
*NL*
cautiously
beckoned
the
prince
up
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
you
rang
the
bell
this
morning
I
thought
it
must
be
you
.
I
went
to
*NL*
the
door
on
tip-toe
and
heard
you
talking
to
the
servant
opposite
.
I
had
*NL*
told
her
before
that
if
anyone
came
and
rang
--
especially
you
,
and
I
gave
*NL*
her
your
name
--
she
was
not
to
tell
about
me
.
Then
I
thought
,
what
if
*NL*
he
goes
and
stands
opposite
and
looks
up
,
or
waits
about
to
watch
the
*NL*
house
?
So
I
came
to
this
very
window
,
looked
out
,
and
there
you
were
*NL*
staring
straight
at
me
.
That
's
how
it
came
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
Nastasia
Philipovna
?
''
asked
the
prince
,
breathlessly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
here
,
''
replied
Rogojin
,
slowly
,
after
a
slight
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rogojin
raised
his
eyes
and
gazed
intently
at
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
continued
to
speak
in
a
whisper
,
very
deliberately
as
before
,
and
*NL*
looked
strangely
thoughtful
and
dreamy
.
Even
while
he
told
the
story
of
*NL*
how
he
had
peeped
through
the
blind
,
he
gave
the
impression
of
wishing
*NL*
to
say
something
else
.
They
entered
the
study
.
In
this
room
some
changes
*NL*
had
taken
place
since
the
prince
last
saw
it
.
It
was
now
divided
into
*NL*
two
equal
parts
by
a
heavy
green
silk
curtain
stretched
across
it
,
*NL*
separating
the
alcove
beyond
,
where
stood
Rogojin
's
bed
,
from
the
rest
*NL*
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
heavy
curtain
was
drawn
now
,
and
it
was
very
dark
.
The
bright
*NL*
Petersburg
summer
nights
were
already
beginning
to
close
in
,
and
but
for
*NL*
the
full
moon
,
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
distinguish
anything
in
*NL*
Rogojin
's
dismal
room
,
with
the
drawn
blinds
.
They
could
just
see
one
*NL*
anothers
faces
,
however
,
though
not
in
detail
.
Rogojin
's
face
was
white
,
*NL*
as
usual
.
His
glittering
eyes
watched
the
prince
with
an
intent
stare
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Had
you
not
better
light
a
candle
?
''
said
Muishkin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
need
n't
,
''
replied
Rogojin
,
and
taking
the
other
by
the
hand
he
*NL*
drew
him
down
to
a
chair
.
He
himself
took
a
chair
opposite
and
drew
it
*NL*
up
so
close
that
he
almost
pressed
against
the
prince
's
knees
.
At
their
*NL*
side
was
a
little
round
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sit
down
,
''
said
Rogojin
;
``
let
's
rest
a
bit
.
''
There
was
silence
for
a
*NL*
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
you
would
be
at
that
hotel
,
''
he
continued
,
just
as
men
sometimes
*NL*
commence
a
serious
conversation
by
discussing
any
outside
subject
before
*NL*
leading
up
to
the
main
point
.
``
As
I
entered
the
passage
it
struck
me
*NL*
that
perhaps
you
were
sitting
and
waiting
for
me
,
just
as
I
was
waiting
*NL*
for
you
.
Have
you
been
to
the
old
lady
at
Ismailofsky
barracks
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
the
prince
,
squeezing
the
word
out
with
difficulty
owing
to
*NL*
the
dreadful
beating
of
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
would
.
`
They
'll
talk
about
it
,
'
I
thought
;
so
I
*NL*
determined
to
go
and
fetch
you
to
spend
the
night
here
--
`
We
will
be
*NL*
together
,
'
I
thought
,
`
for
this
one
night
--
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rogojin
,
_
where
_
is
Nastasia
Philipovna
?
''
said
the
prince
,
suddenly
*NL*
rising
from
his
seat
.
He
was
quaking
in
all
his
limbs
,
and
his
words
*NL*
came
in
a
scarcely
audible
whisper
.
Rogojin
rose
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
''
he
whispered
,
nodding
his
head
towards
the
curtain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Asleep
?
''
whispered
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rogojin
looked
intently
at
him
again
,
as
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
go
in
--
but
you
must
n't
--
well
--
let
's
go
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
lifted
the
curtain
,
paused
--
and
turned
to
the
prince
.
``
Go
in
,
''
he
*NL*
said
,
motioning
him
to
pass
behind
the
curtain
.
Muishkin
went
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
so
dark
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
see
quite
enough
,
''
muttered
Rogojin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
just
see
there
's
a
bed
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
nearer
,
''
suggested
Rogojin
,
softly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
took
a
step
forward
--
then
another
--
and
paused
.
He
stood
and
*NL*
stared
for
a
minute
or
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
Neither
of
the
men
spoke
a
word
while
at
the
bedside
.
The
prince
's
heart
*NL*
beat
so
loud
that
its
knocking
seemed
to
be
distinctly
audible
in
the
*NL*
deathly
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
now
his
eyes
had
become
so
far
accustomed
to
the
darkness
that
he
*NL*
could
distinguish
the
whole
of
the
bed
.
Someone
was
asleep
upon
*NL*
it
--
in
an
absolutely
motionless
sleep
.
Not
the
slightest
movement
was
*NL*
perceptible
,
not
the
faintest
breathing
could
be
heard
.
The
sleeper
*NL*
was
covered
with
a
white
sheet
;
the
outline
of
the
limbs
was
hardly
*NL*
distinguishable
.
He
could
only
just
make
out
that
a
human
being
lay
*NL*
outstretched
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
around
,
on
the
bed
,
on
a
chair
beside
it
,
on
the
floor
,
were
*NL*
scattered
the
different
portions
of
a
magnificent
white
silk
dress
,
bits
*NL*
of
lace
,
ribbons
and
flowers
.
On
a
small
table
at
the
bedside
glittered
*NL*
a
mass
of
diamonds
,
torn
off
and
thrown
down
anyhow
.
From
under
a
heap
*NL*
of
lace
at
the
end
of
the
bed
peeped
a
small
white
foot
,
which
looked
as
*NL*
though
it
had
been
chiselled
out
of
marble
;
it
was
terribly
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
gazed
and
gazed
,
and
felt
that
the
more
he
gazed
the
more
*NL*
death-like
became
the
silence
.
Suddenly
a
fly
awoke
somewhere
,
buzzed
*NL*
across
the
room
,
and
settled
on
the
pillow
.
The
prince
shuddered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
go
,
''
said
Rogojin
,
touching
his
shoulder
.
They
left
the
alcove
*NL*
and
sat
down
in
the
two
chairs
they
had
occupied
before
,
opposite
to
one
*NL*
another
.
The
prince
trembled
more
and
more
violently
,
and
never
took
his
*NL*
questioning
eyes
off
Rogojin
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
you
are
shuddering
,
Lef
Nicolaievitch
,
''
said
the
latter
,
at
*NL*
length
,
``
almost
as
you
did
once
in
Moscow
,
before
your
fit
;
do
n't
you
*NL*
remember
?
I
do
n't
know
what
I
shall
do
with
you
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
bent
forward
to
listen
,
putting
all
the
strain
he
could
*NL*
muster
upon
his
understanding
in
order
to
take
in
what
Rogojin
said
,
and
*NL*
continuing
to
gaze
at
the
latter
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
it
you
?
''
he
muttered
,
at
last
,
motioning
with
his
head
towards
the
*NL*
curtain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
was
I
,
''
whispered
Rogojin
,
looking
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
Neither
spoke
for
five
minutes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
,
you
know
,
''
Rogojin
recommenced
,
as
though
continuing
a
former
*NL*
sentence
,
``
if
you
were
ill
now
,
or
had
a
fit
,
or
screamed
,
or
anything
,
*NL*
they
might
hear
it
in
the
yard
,
or
even
in
the
street
,
and
guess
that
*NL*
someone
was
passing
the
night
in
the
house
.
They
would
all
come
and
*NL*
knock
and
want
to
come
in
,
because
they
know
I
am
not
at
home
.
I
did
n't
*NL*
light
a
candle
for
the
same
reason
.
When
I
am
not
here
--
for
two
or
*NL*
three
days
at
a
time
,
now
and
then
--
no
one
comes
in
to
tidy
the
house
*NL*
or
anything
;
those
are
my
orders
.
So
that
I
want
them
to
not
know
we
are
*NL*
spending
the
night
here
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
,
''
interrupted
the
prince
.
``
I
asked
both
the
porter
and
the
woman
*NL*
whether
Nastasia
Philipovna
had
spent
last
night
in
the
house
;
so
they
*NL*
knew
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
you
asked
.
I
told
them
that
she
had
called
in
for
ten
minutes
,
*NL*
and
then
gone
straight
back
to
Pavlofsk
.
No
one
knows
she
slept
here
.
*NL*
Last
night
we
came
in
just
as
carefully
as
you
and
I
did
today
.
I
*NL*
thought
as
I
came
along
with
her
that
she
would
not
like
to
creep
in
so
*NL*
secretly
,
but
I
was
quite
wrong
.
She
whispered
,
and
walked
on
tip-toe
;
*NL*
she
carried
her
skirt
over
her
arm
,
so
that
it
should
n't
rustle
,
and
*NL*
she
held
up
her
finger
at
me
on
the
stairs
,
so
that
I
should
n't
make
*NL*
a
noise
--
it
was
you
she
was
afraid
of
.
She
was
mad
with
terror
in
the
*NL*
train
,
and
she
begged
me
to
bring
her
to
this
house
.
I
thought
of
taking
*NL*
her
to
her
rooms
at
the
Ismailofsky
barracks
first
;
but
she
would
n't
*NL*
hear
of
it
.
She
said
,
`
No
--
not
there
;
he
'll
find
me
out
at
once
there
.
*NL*
Take
me
to
your
own
house
,
where
you
can
hide
me
,
and
tomorrow
we
'll
set
*NL*
off
for
Moscow
.
'
Thence
she
would
go
to
Orel
,
she
said
.
When
she
went
to
*NL*
bed
,
she
was
still
talking
about
going
to
Orel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
!
What
do
you
intend
to
do
now
,
Parfen
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'm
afraid
of
you
.
You
shudder
and
tremble
so
.
We
'll
pass
the
*NL*
night
here
together
.
There
are
no
other
beds
besides
that
one
;
but
I
've
*NL*
thought
how
we
'll
manage
.
I
'll
take
the
cushions
off
all
the
sofas
,
and
*NL*
lay
them
down
on
the
floor
,
up
against
the
curtain
here
--
for
you
and
*NL*
me
--
so
that
we
shall
be
together
.
For
if
they
come
in
and
look
about
*NL*
now
,
you
know
,
they
'll
find
her
,
and
carry
her
away
,
and
they
'll
be
*NL*
asking
me
questions
,
and
I
shall
say
I
did
it
,
and
then
they
'll
take
me
*NL*
away
,
too
,
do
n't
you
see
?
So
let
her
lie
close
to
us
--
close
to
you
and
*NL*
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
agreed
the
prince
,
warmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
we
will
not
say
anything
about
it
,
or
let
them
take
her
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
for
anything
!
''
cried
the
other
;
``
no
,
no
,
no
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
had
decided
,
my
friend
;
not
to
give
her
up
to
anyone
,
''
continued
*NL*
Rogojin
.
``
We
'll
be
very
quiet
.
I
have
only
been
out
of
the
house
one
*NL*
hour
all
day
,
all
the
rest
of
the
time
I
have
been
with
her
.
I
dare
say
*NL*
the
air
is
very
bad
here
.
It
is
so
hot
.
Do
you
find
it
bad
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
--
perhaps
--
by
morning
it
will
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
covered
her
with
oil-cloth
--
best
American
oilcloth
,
and
put
*NL*
the
sheet
over
that
,
and
four
jars
of
disinfectant
,
on
account
of
the
*NL*
smell
--
as
they
did
at
Moscow
--
you
remember
?
And
she
's
lying
so
still
;
*NL*
you
shall
see
,
in
the
morning
,
when
it
's
light
.
What
!
ca
n't
you
get
up
?
''
*NL*
asked
Rogojin
,
seeing
the
other
was
trembling
so
that
he
could
not
rise
*NL*
from
his
seat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
legs
wo
n't
move
,
''
said
the
prince
;
``
it
's
fear
,
I
know
.
When
my
fear
*NL*
is
over
,
I
'll
get
up
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
a
bit
--
I
'll
make
the
bed
,
and
you
can
lie
down
.
I
'll
lie
down
,
*NL*
too
,
and
we
'll
listen
and
watch
,
for
I
do
n't
know
yet
what
I
shall
do
...
*NL*
I
tell
you
beforehand
,
so
that
you
may
be
ready
in
case
I
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Muttering
these
disconnected
words
,
Rogojin
began
to
make
up
the
beds
.
*NL*
It
was
clear
that
he
had
devised
these
beds
long
before
;
last
night
he
*NL*
slept
on
the
sofa
.
But
there
was
no
room
for
two
on
the
sofa
,
and
he
*NL*
seemed
anxious
that
he
and
the
prince
should
be
close
to
one
another
;
*NL*
therefore
,
he
now
dragged
cushions
of
all
sizes
and
shapes
from
the
*NL*
sofas
,
and
made
a
sort
of
bed
of
them
close
by
the
curtain
.
He
then
*NL*
approached
the
prince
,
and
gently
helped
him
to
rise
,
and
led
him
*NL*
towards
the
bed
.
But
the
prince
could
now
walk
by
himself
,
so
that
his
*NL*
fear
must
have
passed
;
for
all
that
,
however
,
he
continued
to
shudder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
hot
weather
,
you
see
,
''
continued
Rogojin
,
as
he
lay
down
on
the
*NL*
cushions
beside
Muishkin
,
``
and
,
naturally
,
there
will
be
a
smell
.
I
*NL*
dare
n't
open
the
window
.
My
mother
has
some
beautiful
flowers
in
pots
;
*NL*
they
have
a
delicious
scent
;
I
thought
of
fetching
them
in
,
but
that
old
*NL*
servant
will
find
out
,
she
's
very
inquisitive
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
she
is
inquisitive
,
''
assented
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
of
buying
flowers
,
and
putting
them
all
round
her
;
but
I
was
*NL*
afraid
it
would
make
us
sad
to
see
her
with
flowers
round
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
,
''
said
the
prince
;
he
was
bewildered
,
and
his
brain
wandered
.
*NL*
He
seemed
to
be
continually
groping
for
the
questions
he
wished
to
ask
,
*NL*
and
then
losing
them
.
``
Listen
--
tell
me
--
how
did
you
--
with
a
knife
?
--
That
*NL*
same
one
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
same
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
a
minute
,
I
want
to
ask
you
something
else
,
Parfen
;
all
sorts
of
*NL*
things
;
but
tell
me
first
,
did
you
intend
to
kill
her
before
my
wedding
,
*NL*
at
the
church
door
,
with
your
knife
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
whether
I
did
or
not
,
''
said
Rogojin
,
drily
,
seeming
to
be
*NL*
a
little
astonished
at
the
question
,
and
not
quite
taking
it
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
never
take
your
knife
to
Pavlofsk
with
you
?
''
``
No
.
As
to
the
*NL*
knife
,
''
he
added
,
``
this
is
all
I
can
tell
you
about
it
.
''
He
was
silent
*NL*
for
a
moment
,
and
then
said
,
``
I
took
it
out
of
the
locked
drawer
this
*NL*
morning
about
three
,
for
it
was
in
the
early
morning
all
this
--
happened
.
*NL*
It
has
been
inside
the
book
ever
since
--
and
--
and
--
this
is
what
is
such
*NL*
a
marvel
to
me
,
the
knife
only
went
in
a
couple
of
inches
at
most
,
just
*NL*
under
her
left
breast
,
and
there
was
n't
more
than
half
a
tablespoonful
*NL*
of
blood
altogether
,
not
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
yes
--
yes
--
''
The
prince
jumped
up
in
extraordinary
agitation
.
*NL*
``
I
know
,
I
know
,
I
've
read
of
that
sort
of
thing
--
it
's
internal
*NL*
haemorrhage
,
you
know
.
Sometimes
there
is
n't
a
drop
--
if
the
blow
goes
*NL*
straight
to
the
heart
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
--
listen
!
''
cried
Rogojin
,
suddenly
,
starting
up
.
``
Somebody
's
*NL*
walking
about
,
do
you
hear
?
In
the
hall
.
''
Both
sat
up
to
listen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hear
,
''
said
the
prince
in
a
whisper
,
his
eyes
fixed
on
Rogojin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Footsteps
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
we
shut
the
door
,
and
lock
it
,
or
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
lock
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
locked
the
door
,
and
both
lay
down
again
.
There
was
a
long
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
by-the-by
,
''
whispered
the
prince
,
hurriedly
and
excitedly
as
*NL*
before
,
as
though
he
had
just
seized
hold
of
an
idea
and
was
afraid
of
*NL*
losing
it
again
.
``
I
--
I
wanted
those
cards
!
They
say
you
played
cards
*NL*
with
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
played
with
her
,
''
said
Rogojin
,
after
a
short
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
the
cards
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
they
are
,
''
said
Rogojin
,
after
a
still
longer
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
pulled
out
a
pack
of
cards
,
wrapped
in
a
bit
of
paper
,
from
his
*NL*
pocket
,
and
handed
them
to
the
prince
.
The
latter
took
them
,
with
a
sort
*NL*
of
perplexity
.
A
new
,
sad
,
helpless
feeling
weighed
on
his
heart
;
he
had
*NL*
suddenly
realized
that
not
only
at
this
moment
,
but
for
a
long
while
,
*NL*
he
had
not
been
saying
what
he
wanted
to
say
,
had
not
been
acting
as
he
*NL*
wanted
to
act
;
and
that
these
cards
which
he
held
in
his
hand
,
and
which
*NL*
he
had
been
so
delighted
to
have
at
first
,
were
now
of
no
use
--
no
use
...
*NL*
He
rose
,
and
wrung
his
hands
.
Rogojin
lay
motionless
,
and
seemed
neither
*NL*
to
hear
nor
see
his
movements
;
but
his
eyes
blazed
in
the
darkness
,
and
*NL*
were
fixed
in
a
wild
stare
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
sat
down
on
a
chair
,
and
watched
him
in
alarm
.
Half
an
hour
*NL*
went
by
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
Rogojin
burst
into
a
loud
abrupt
laugh
,
as
though
he
had
quite
*NL*
forgotten
that
they
must
speak
in
whispers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
officer
,
eh
!
--
that
young
officer
--
do
n't
you
remember
that
fellow
*NL*
at
the
band
?
Eh
?
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
Did
n't
she
whip
him
smartly
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
jumped
up
from
his
seat
in
renewed
terror
.
When
Rogojin
*NL*
quieted
down
-LRB-
which
he
did
at
once
-RRB-
the
prince
bent
over
him
,
sat
down
*NL*
beside
him
,
and
with
painfully
beating
heart
and
still
more
painful
*NL*
breath
,
watched
his
face
intently
.
Rogojin
never
turned
his
head
,
and
*NL*
seemed
to
have
forgotten
all
about
him
.
The
prince
watched
and
waited
.
*NL*
Time
went
on
--
it
began
to
grow
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rogojin
began
to
wander
--
muttering
disconnectedly
;
then
he
took
to
*NL*
shouting
and
laughing
.
The
prince
stretched
out
a
trembling
hand
and
*NL*
gently
stroked
his
hair
and
his
cheeks
--
he
could
do
nothing
more
.
His
*NL*
legs
trembled
again
and
he
seemed
to
have
lost
the
use
of
them
.
A
*NL*
new
sensation
came
over
him
,
filling
his
heart
and
soul
with
infinite
*NL*
anguish
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
the
daylight
grew
full
and
strong
;
and
at
last
the
prince
*NL*
lay
down
,
as
though
overcome
by
despair
,
and
laid
his
face
against
the
*NL*
white
,
motionless
face
of
Rogojin
.
His
tears
flowed
on
to
Rogojin
's
*NL*
cheek
,
though
he
was
perhaps
not
aware
of
them
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
all
events
when
,
after
many
hours
,
the
door
was
opened
and
people
*NL*
thronged
in
,
they
found
the
murderer
unconscious
and
in
a
raging
fever
.
*NL*
The
prince
was
sitting
by
him
,
motionless
,
and
each
time
that
the
sick
*NL*
man
gave
a
laugh
,
or
a
shout
,
he
hastened
to
pass
his
own
trembling
hand
*NL*
over
his
companion
's
hair
and
cheeks
,
as
though
trying
to
soothe
and
*NL*
quiet
him
.
But
alas
!
he
understood
nothing
of
what
was
said
to
him
,
and
*NL*
recognized
none
of
those
who
surrounded
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
Schneider
himself
had
arrived
then
and
seen
his
former
pupil
and
*NL*
patient
,
remembering
the
prince
's
condition
during
the
first
year
in
*NL*
Switzerland
,
he
would
have
flung
up
his
hands
,
despairingly
,
and
cried
,
*NL*
as
he
did
then
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
idiot
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
XII
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
widow
hurried
away
to
Pavlofsk
,
she
went
straight
to
Daria
*NL*
Alexeyevna
's
house
,
and
telling
all
she
knew
,
threw
her
into
a
state
of
*NL*
great
alarm
.
Both
ladies
decided
to
communicate
at
once
with
Lebedeff
,
*NL*
who
,
as
the
friend
and
landlord
of
the
prince
,
was
also
much
agitated
.
*NL*
Vera
Lebedeff
told
all
she
knew
,
and
by
Lebedeff
's
advice
it
was
decided
*NL*
that
all
three
should
go
to
Petersburg
as
quickly
as
possible
,
in
order
*NL*
to
avert
``
what
might
so
easily
happen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
how
it
came
about
that
at
eleven
o'clock
next
morning
Rogojin
's
*NL*
flat
was
opened
by
the
police
in
the
presence
of
Lebedeff
,
the
two
*NL*
ladies
,
and
Rogojin
's
own
brother
,
who
lived
in
the
wing
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
evidence
of
the
porter
went
further
than
anything
else
towards
the
*NL*
success
of
Lebedeff
in
gaining
the
assistance
of
the
police
.
He
declared
*NL*
that
he
had
seen
Rogojin
return
to
the
house
last
night
,
accompanied
by
*NL*
a
friend
,
and
that
both
had
gone
upstairs
very
secretly
and
cautiously
.
*NL*
After
this
there
was
no
hesitation
about
breaking
open
the
door
,
since
*NL*
it
could
not
be
got
open
in
any
other
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rogojin
suffered
from
brain
fever
for
two
months
.
When
he
recovered
from
*NL*
the
attack
he
was
at
once
brought
up
on
trial
for
murder
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
gave
full
,
satisfactory
,
and
direct
evidence
on
every
point
;
and
the
*NL*
prince
's
name
was
,
thanks
to
this
,
not
brought
into
the
proceedings
.
*NL*
Rogojin
was
very
quiet
during
the
progress
of
the
trial
.
He
did
not
*NL*
contradict
his
clever
and
eloquent
counsel
,
who
argued
that
the
brain
*NL*
fever
,
or
inflammation
of
the
brain
,
was
the
cause
of
the
crime
;
*NL*
clearly
proving
that
this
malady
had
existed
long
before
the
murder
was
*NL*
perpetrated
,
and
had
been
brought
on
by
the
sufferings
of
the
accused
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Rogojin
added
no
words
of
his
own
in
confirmation
of
this
view
,
and
*NL*
as
before
,
he
recounted
with
marvellous
exactness
the
details
of
*NL*
his
crime
.
He
was
convicted
,
but
with
extenuating
circumstances
,
and
*NL*
condemned
to
hard
labour
in
Siberia
for
fifteen
years
.
He
heard
his
*NL*
sentence
grimly
,
silently
,
and
thoughtfully
.
His
colossal
fortune
,
with
*NL*
the
exception
of
the
comparatively
small
portion
wasted
in
the
first
*NL*
wanton
period
of
his
inheritance
,
went
to
his
brother
,
to
the
great
*NL*
satisfaction
of
the
latter
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
lady
,
Rogojin
's
mother
,
is
still
alive
,
and
remembers
her
*NL*
favourite
son
Parfen
sometimes
,
but
not
clearly
.
God
spared
her
the
*NL*
knowledge
of
this
dreadful
calamity
which
had
overtaken
her
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lebedeff
,
Keller
,
Gania
,
Ptitsin
,
and
many
other
friends
of
ours
*NL*
continue
to
live
as
before
.
There
is
scarcely
any
change
in
them
,
so
*NL*
that
there
is
no
need
to
tell
of
their
subsequent
doings
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hippolyte
died
in
great
agitation
,
and
rather
sooner
than
he
expected
,
*NL*
about
a
fortnight
after
Nastasia
Philipovna
's
death
.
Colia
was
much
*NL*
affected
by
these
events
,
and
drew
nearer
to
his
mother
in
heart
and
*NL*
sympathy
.
Nina
Alexandrovna
is
anxious
,
because
he
is
``
thoughtful
beyond
*NL*
his
years
,
''
but
he
will
,
we
think
,
make
a
useful
and
active
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
's
further
fate
was
more
or
less
decided
by
Colia
,
who
*NL*
selected
,
out
of
all
the
persons
he
had
met
during
the
last
six
or
seven
*NL*
months
,
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
,
as
friend
and
confidant
.
To
him
he
made
over
*NL*
all
that
he
knew
as
to
the
events
above
recorded
,
and
as
to
the
present
*NL*
condition
of
the
prince
.
He
was
not
far
wrong
in
his
choice
.
Evgenie
*NL*
Pavlovitch
took
the
deepest
interest
in
the
fate
of
the
unfortunate
*NL*
``
idiot
,
''
and
,
thanks
to
his
influence
,
the
prince
found
himself
once
*NL*
more
with
Dr.
Schneider
,
in
Switzerland
.
*NL*
*NL*
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
,
who
went
abroad
at
this
time
,
intending
to
live
a
*NL*
long
while
on
the
continent
,
being
,
as
he
often
said
,
quite
superfluous
*NL*
in
Russia
,
visits
his
sick
friend
at
Schneider
's
every
few
months
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Dr.
Schneider
frowns
ever
more
and
more
and
shakes
his
head
;
he
*NL*
hints
that
the
brain
is
fatally
injured
;
he
does
not
as
yet
declare
that
*NL*
his
patient
is
incurable
,
but
he
allows
himself
to
express
the
gravest
*NL*
fears
.
*NL*
*NL*
Evgenie
takes
this
much
to
heart
,
and
he
has
a
heart
,
as
is
proved
*NL*
by
the
fact
that
he
receives
and
even
answers
letters
from
Colia
.
But
*NL*
besides
this
,
another
trait
in
his
character
has
become
apparent
,
and
as
*NL*
it
is
a
good
trait
we
will
make
haste
to
reveal
it
.
After
each
visit
*NL*
to
Schneider
's
establishment
,
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
writes
another
letter
,
*NL*
besides
that
to
Colia
,
giving
the
most
minute
particulars
concerning
the
*NL*
invalid
's
condition
.
In
these
letters
is
to
be
detected
,
and
in
each
one
*NL*
more
than
the
last
,
a
growing
feeling
of
friendship
and
sympathy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
individual
who
corresponds
thus
with
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
,
and
who
*NL*
engages
so
much
of
his
attention
and
respect
,
is
Vera
Lebedeff
.
We
have
*NL*
never
been
able
to
discover
clearly
how
such
relations
sprang
up
.
*NL*
Of
course
the
root
of
them
was
in
the
events
which
we
have
already
*NL*
recorded
,
and
which
so
filled
Vera
with
grief
on
the
prince
's
account
*NL*
that
she
fell
seriously
ill
.
But
exactly
how
the
acquaintance
and
*NL*
friendship
came
about
,
we
can
not
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
spoken
of
these
letters
chiefly
because
in
them
is
often
to
be
*NL*
found
some
news
of
the
Epanchin
family
,
and
of
Aglaya
in
particular
.
*NL*
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
wrote
of
her
from
Paris
,
that
after
a
short
and
*NL*
sudden
attachment
to
a
certain
Polish
count
,
an
exile
,
she
had
suddenly
*NL*
married
him
,
quite
against
the
wishes
of
her
parents
,
though
they
had
*NL*
eventually
given
their
consent
through
fear
of
a
terrible
scandal
.
*NL*
Then
,
after
a
six
months
'
silence
,
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
informed
his
*NL*
correspondent
,
in
a
long
letter
,
full
of
detail
,
that
while
paying
his
*NL*
last
visit
to
Dr.
Schneider
's
establishment
,
he
had
there
come
across
*NL*
the
whole
Epanchin
family
-LRB-
excepting
the
general
,
who
had
remained
in
*NL*
St.
Petersburg
-RRB-
and
Prince
S
.
The
meeting
was
a
strange
one
.
They
*NL*
all
received
Evgenie
Pavlovitch
with
effusive
delight
;
Adelaida
and
*NL*
Alexandra
were
deeply
grateful
to
him
for
his
``
angelic
kindness
to
the
*NL*
unhappy
prince
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
,
when
she
saw
poor
Muishkin
,
in
his
enfeebled
and
*NL*
humiliated
condition
,
had
wept
bitterly
.
Apparently
all
was
forgiven
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
S.
had
made
a
few
just
and
sensible
remarks
.
It
seemed
to
Evgenie
*NL*
Pavlovitch
that
there
was
not
yet
perfect
harmony
between
Adelaida
and
*NL*
her
fiance
,
but
he
thought
that
in
time
the
impulsive
young
girl
would
*NL*
let
herself
be
guided
by
his
reason
and
experience
.
Besides
,
the
recent
*NL*
events
that
had
befallen
her
family
had
given
Adelaida
much
to
think
*NL*
about
,
especially
the
sad
experiences
of
her
younger
sister
.
Within
six
*NL*
months
,
everything
that
the
family
had
dreaded
from
the
marriage
with
*NL*
the
Polish
count
had
come
to
pass
.
He
turned
out
to
be
neither
count
*NL*
nor
exile
--
at
least
,
in
the
political
sense
of
the
word
--
but
had
had
to
*NL*
leave
his
native
land
owing
to
some
rather
dubious
affair
of
the
past
.
*NL*
It
was
his
noble
patriotism
,
of
which
he
made
a
great
display
,
that
*NL*
had
rendered
him
so
interesting
in
Aglaya
's
eyes
.
She
was
so
fascinated
*NL*
that
,
even
before
marrying
him
,
she
joined
a
committee
that
had
been
*NL*
organized
abroad
to
work
for
the
restoration
of
Poland
;
and
further
,
*NL*
she
visited
the
confessional
of
a
celebrated
Jesuit
priest
,
who
made
an
*NL*
absolute
fanatic
of
her
.
The
supposed
fortune
of
the
count
had
dwindled
*NL*
to
a
mere
nothing
,
although
he
had
given
almost
irrefutable
evidence
of
*NL*
its
existence
to
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
and
Prince
S.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
this
,
before
they
had
been
married
half
a
year
,
the
count
and
*NL*
his
friend
the
priest
managed
to
bring
about
a
quarrel
between
Aglaya
*NL*
and
her
family
,
so
that
it
was
now
several
months
since
they
had
seen
*NL*
her
.
In
a
word
,
there
was
a
great
deal
to
say
;
but
Mrs.
Epanchin
,
and
*NL*
her
daughters
,
and
even
Prince
S.
,
were
still
so
much
distressed
by
*NL*
Aglaya
's
latest
infatuations
and
adventures
,
that
they
did
not
care
to
*NL*
talk
of
them
,
though
they
must
have
known
that
Evgenie
knew
much
of
the
*NL*
story
already
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Lizabetha
Prokofievna
was
most
anxious
to
get
home
,
and
,
according
*NL*
to
Evgenie
's
account
,
she
criticized
everything
foreign
with
much
*NL*
hostility
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
ca
n't
bake
bread
anywhere
,
decently
;
and
they
all
freeze
in
their
*NL*
houses
,
during
winter
,
like
a
lot
of
mice
in
a
cellar
.
At
all
events
,
*NL*
I
've
had
a
good
Russian
cry
over
this
poor
fellow
,
''
she
added
,
pointing
*NL*
to
the
prince
,
who
had
not
recognized
her
in
the
slightest
degree
.
*NL*
``
So
enough
of
this
nonsense
;
it
's
time
we
faced
the
truth
.
All
this
*NL*
continental
life
,
all
this
Europe
of
yours
,
and
all
the
trash
about
*NL*
`
going
abroad
'
is
simply
foolery
,
and
it
is
mere
foolery
on
our
part
*NL*
to
come
.
Remember
what
I
say
,
my
friend
;
you
'll
live
to
agree
with
me
*NL*
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
spoke
the
good
lady
,
almost
angrily
,
as
she
took
leave
of
Evgenie
*NL*
Pavlovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
