Preface
By
The
Author
*NL*
*NL*
Reader
be
assured
this
narrative
is
no
fiction
.
I
am
aware
that
some
of
my
*NL*
adventures
may
seem
incredible
;
but
they
are
,
nevertheless
,
strictly
true
.
*NL*
I
have
not
exaggerated
the
wrongs
inflicted
by
Slavery
;
on
the
contrary
,
my
*NL*
descriptions
fall
far
short
of
the
facts
.
I
have
concealed
the
names
of
*NL*
places
,
and
given
persons
fictitious
names
.
I
had
no
motive
for
secrecy
on
*NL*
my
own
account
,
but
I
deemed
it
kind
and
considerate
towards
others
to
*NL*
pursue
this
course
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
wish
I
were
more
competent
to
the
task
I
have
undertaken
.
But
I
trust
my
*NL*
readers
will
excuse
deficiencies
in
consideration
of
circumstances
.
I
was
*NL*
born
and
reared
in
Slavery
;
and
I
remained
in
a
Slave
State
twenty-seven
*NL*
years
.
Since
I
have
been
at
the
North
,
it
has
been
necessary
for
me
to
work
*NL*
diligently
for
my
own
support
,
and
the
education
of
my
children
.
This
has
*NL*
not
left
me
much
leisure
to
make
up
for
the
loss
of
early
opportunities
to
*NL*
improve
myself
;
and
it
has
compelled
me
to
write
these
pages
at
irregular
*NL*
intervals
,
whenever
I
could
snatch
an
hour
from
household
duties
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
first
arrived
in
Philadelphia
,
Bishop
Paine
advised
me
to
publish
a
*NL*
sketch
of
my
life
,
but
I
told
him
I
was
altogether
incompetent
to
such
an
*NL*
undertaking
.
Though
I
have
improved
my
mind
somewhat
since
that
time
,
I
*NL*
still
remain
of
the
same
opinion
;
but
I
trust
my
motives
will
excuse
what
*NL*
might
otherwise
seem
presumptuous
.
I
have
not
written
my
experiences
in
*NL*
order
to
attract
attention
to
myself
;
on
the
contrary
,
it
would
have
been
*NL*
more
pleasant
to
me
to
have
been
silent
about
my
own
history
.
Neither
do
I
*NL*
care
to
excite
sympathy
for
my
own
sufferings
.
But
I
do
earnestly
desire
to
*NL*
arouse
the
women
of
the
North
to
a
realizing
sense
of
the
condition
of
two
*NL*
millions
of
women
at
the
South
,
still
in
bondage
,
suffering
what
I
*NL*
suffered
,
and
most
of
them
far
worse
.
I
want
to
add
my
testimony
to
that
of
*NL*
abler
pens
to
convince
the
people
of
the
Free
States
what
Slavery
really
*NL*
is
.
Only
by
experience
can
any
one
realize
how
deep
,
and
dark
,
and
foul
is
*NL*
that
pit
of
abominations
.
May
the
blessing
of
God
rest
on
this
imperfect
*NL*
effort
in
behalf
of
my
persecuted
people
!

Introduction
By
The
Editor
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
author
of
the
following
autobiography
is
personally
known
to
me
,
and
*NL*
her
conversation
and
manners
inspire
me
with
confidence
.
During
the
last
*NL*
seventeen
years
,
she
has
lived
the
greater
part
of
the
time
with
a
*NL*
distinguished
family
in
New
York
,
and
has
so
deported
herself
as
to
be
*NL*
highly
esteemed
by
them
.
This
fact
is
sufficient
,
without
further
*NL*
credentials
of
her
character
.
I
believe
those
who
know
her
will
not
be
*NL*
disposed
to
doubt
her
veracity
,
though
some
incidents
in
her
story
are
more
*NL*
romantic
than
fiction
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
her
request
,
I
have
revised
her
manuscript
;
but
such
changes
as
I
have
*NL*
made
have
been
mainly
for
purposes
of
condensation
and
orderly
arrangement
.
*NL*
I
have
not
added
any
thing
to
the
incidents
,
or
changed
the
import
of
her
*NL*
very
pertinent
remarks
.
With
trifling
exceptions
,
both
the
ideas
and
the
*NL*
language
are
her
own
.
I
pruned
excrescences
a
little
,
but
otherwise
I
had
*NL*
no
reason
for
changing
her
lively
and
dramatic
way
of
telling
her
own
*NL*
story
.
The
names
of
both
persons
and
places
are
known
to
me
;
but
for
good
*NL*
reasons
I
suppress
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
will
naturally
excite
surprise
that
a
woman
reared
in
Slavery
should
be
*NL*
able
to
write
so
well
.
But
circumstances
will
explain
this
.
In
the
first
*NL*
place
,
nature
endowed
her
with
quick
perceptions
.
Secondly
,
the
mistress
,
*NL*
with
whom
she
lived
till
she
was
twelve
years
old
,
was
a
kind
,
considerate
*NL*
friend
,
who
taught
her
to
read
and
spell
.
Thirdly
,
she
was
placed
in
*NL*
favorable
circumstances
after
she
came
to
the
North
;
having
frequent
*NL*
intercourse
with
intelligent
persons
,
who
felt
a
friendly
interest
in
her
*NL*
welfare
,
and
were
disposed
to
give
her
opportunities
for
self-improvement
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
well
aware
that
many
will
accuse
me
of
indecorum
for
presenting
these
*NL*
pages
to
the
public
;
for
the
experiences
of
this
intelligent
and
*NL*
much-injured
woman
belong
to
a
class
which
some
call
delicate
subjects
,
and
*NL*
others
indelicate
.
This
peculiar
phase
of
Slavery
has
generally
been
kept
*NL*
veiled
;
but
the
public
ought
to
be
made
acquainted
with
its
monstrous
*NL*
features
,
and
I
willingly
take
the
responsibility
of
presenting
them
with
*NL*
the
veil
withdrawn
.
I
do
this
for
the
sake
of
my
sisters
in
bondage
,
who
*NL*
are
suffering
wrongs
so
foul
,
that
our
ears
are
too
delicate
to
listen
to
*NL*
them
.
I
do
it
with
the
hope
of
arousing
conscientious
and
reflecting
women
*NL*
at
the
North
to
a
sense
of
their
duty
in
the
exertion
of
moral
influence
on
*NL*
the
question
of
Slavery
,
on
all
possible
occasions
.
I
do
it
with
the
hope
*NL*
that
every
man
who
reads
this
narrative
will
swear
solemnly
before
God
*NL*
that
,
so
far
as
he
has
power
to
prevent
it
,
no
fugitive
from
Slavery
shall
*NL*
ever
be
sent
back
to
suffer
in
that
loathsome
den
of
corruption
and
*NL*
cruelty
.

Childhood
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
born
a
slave
;
but
I
never
knew
it
till
six
years
of
happy
childhood
*NL*
had
passed
away
.
My
father
was
a
carpenter
,
and
considered
so
intelligent
*NL*
and
skilful
in
his
trade
,
that
,
when
buildings
out
of
the
common
line
were
*NL*
to
be
erected
,
he
was
sent
for
from
long
distances
,
to
be
head
workman
.
On
*NL*
condition
of
paying
his
mistress
two
hundred
dollars
a
year
,
and
supporting
*NL*
himself
,
he
was
allowed
to
work
at
his
trade
,
and
manage
his
own
affairs
.
*NL*
His
strongest
wish
was
to
purchase
his
children
;
but
,
though
he
several
*NL*
times
offered
his
hard
earnings
for
that
purpose
,
he
never
succeeded
.
In
*NL*
complexion
my
parents
were
a
light
shade
of
brownish
yellow
,
and
were
*NL*
termed
mulattoes
.
They
lived
together
in
a
comfortable
home
;
and
,
though
we
*NL*
were
all
slaves
,
I
was
so
fondly
shielded
that
I
never
dreamed
I
was
a
*NL*
piece
of
merchandise
,
trusted
to
them
for
safe
keeping
,
and
liable
to
be
*NL*
demanded
of
them
at
any
moment
.
I
had
one
brother
,
William
,
who
was
two
*NL*
years
younger
than
myself
--
a
bright
,
affectionate
child
.
I
had
also
a
great
*NL*
treasure
in
my
maternal
grandmother
,
who
was
a
remarkable
woman
in
many
*NL*
respects
.
She
was
the
daughter
of
a
planter
in
South
Carolina
,
who
,
at
his
*NL*
death
,
left
her
mother
and
his
three
children
free
,
with
money
to
go
to
St.
*NL*
Augustine
,
where
they
had
relatives
.
It
was
during
the
Revolutionary
War
;
*NL*
and
they
were
captured
on
their
passage
,
carried
back
,
and
sold
to
*NL*
different
purchasers
.
Such
was
the
story
my
grandmother
used
to
tell
me
;
*NL*
but
I
do
not
remember
all
the
particulars
.
She
was
a
little
girl
when
she
*NL*
was
captured
and
sold
to
the
keeper
of
a
large
hotel
.
I
have
often
heard
*NL*
her
tell
how
hard
she
fared
during
childhood
.
But
as
she
grew
older
she
*NL*
evinced
so
much
intelligence
,
and
was
so
faithful
,
that
her
master
and
*NL*
mistress
could
not
help
seeing
it
was
for
their
interest
to
take
care
of
*NL*
such
a
valuable
piece
of
property
.
She
became
an
indispensable
personage
in
*NL*
the
household
,
officiating
in
all
capacities
,
from
cook
and
wet
nurse
to
*NL*
seamstress
.
She
was
much
praised
for
her
cooking
;
and
her
nice
crackers
*NL*
became
so
famous
in
the
neighborhood
that
many
people
were
desirous
of
*NL*
obtaining
them
.
In
consequence
of
numerous
requests
of
this
kind
,
she
asked
*NL*
permission
of
her
mistress
to
bake
crackers
at
night
,
after
all
the
*NL*
household
work
was
done
;
and
she
obtained
leave
to
do
it
,
provided
she
*NL*
would
clothe
herself
and
her
children
from
the
profits
.
Upon
these
terms
,
*NL*
after
working
hard
all
day
for
her
mistress
,
she
began
her
midnight
*NL*
bakings
,
assisted
by
her
two
oldest
children
.
The
business
proved
*NL*
profitable
;
and
each
year
she
laid
by
a
little
,
which
was
saved
for
a
fund
*NL*
to
purchase
her
children
.
Her
master
died
,
and
the
property
was
divided
*NL*
among
his
heirs
.
The
widow
had
her
dower
in
the
hotel
which
she
continued
*NL*
to
keep
open
.
My
grandmother
remained
in
her
service
as
a
slave
;
but
her
*NL*
children
were
divided
among
her
master
's
children
.
As
she
had
five
,
*NL*
Benjamin
,
the
youngest
one
,
was
sold
,
in
order
that
each
heir
might
have
an
*NL*
equal
portion
of
dollars
and
cents
.
There
was
so
little
difference
in
our
*NL*
ages
that
he
seemed
more
like
my
brother
than
my
uncle
.
He
was
a
bright
,
*NL*
handsome
lad
,
nearly
white
;
for
he
inherited
the
complexion
my
grandmother
*NL*
had
derived
from
Anglo-Saxon
ancestors
.
Though
only
ten
years
old
,
seven
*NL*
hundred
and
twenty
dollars
were
paid
for
him
.
His
sale
was
a
terrible
blow
*NL*
to
my
grandmother
,
but
she
was
naturally
hopeful
,
and
she
went
to
work
with
*NL*
renewed
energy
,
trusting
in
time
to
be
able
to
purchase
some
of
her
*NL*
children
.
She
had
laid
up
three
hundred
dollars
,
which
her
mistress
one
day
*NL*
begged
as
a
loan
,
promising
to
pay
her
soon
.
The
reader
probably
knows
that
*NL*
no
promise
or
writing
given
to
a
slave
is
legally
binding
;
for
,
according
*NL*
to
Southern
laws
,
a
slave
,
_
being
_
property
,
can
_
hold
_
no
property
.
When
*NL*
my
grandmother
lent
her
hard
earnings
to
her
mistress
,
she
trusted
solely
*NL*
to
her
honor
.
The
honor
of
a
slaveholder
to
a
slave
!
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
good
grandmother
I
was
indebted
for
many
comforts
.
My
brother
*NL*
Willie
and
I
often
received
portions
of
the
crackers
,
cakes
,
and
preserves
,
*NL*
she
made
to
sell
;
and
after
we
ceased
to
be
children
we
were
indebted
to
*NL*
her
for
many
more
important
services
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
were
the
unusually
fortunate
circumstances
of
my
early
childhood
.
When
*NL*
I
was
six
years
old
,
my
mother
died
;
and
then
,
for
the
first
time
,
I
*NL*
learned
,
by
the
talk
around
me
,
that
I
was
a
slave
.

was
the
daughter
of
my
grandmother
's
mistress
.
She
was
the
foster
sister
of
*NL*
my
mother
;
they
were
both
nourished
at
my
grandmother
's
breast
.
In
fact
,
my
*NL*
mother
had
been
weaned
at
three
months
old
,
that
the
babe
of
the
mistress
*NL*
might
obtain
sufficient
food
.
They
played
together
as
children
;
and
,
when
*NL*
they
became
women
,
my
mother
was
a
most
faithful
servant
to
her
whiter
*NL*
foster
sister
.
On
her
death-bed
her
mistress
promised
that
her
children
*NL*
should
never
suffer
for
any
thing
;
and
during
her
lifetime
she
kept
her
*NL*
word
.
They
all
spoke
kindly
of
my
dead
mother
,
who
had
been
a
slave
merely
*NL*
in
name
,
but
in
nature
was
noble
and
womanly
.
I
grieved
for
her
,
and
my
*NL*
young
mind
was
troubled
with
the
thought
who
would
now
take
care
of
me
and
*NL*
my
little
brother
.
I
was
told
that
my
home
was
now
to
be
with
her
mistress
;
*NL*
and
I
found
it
a
happy
one
.
No
toilsome
or
disagreeable
duties
were
imposed
*NL*
on
me
.
My
mistress
was
so
kind
to
me
that
I
was
always
glad
to
do
her
*NL*
bidding
,
and
proud
to
labor
for
her
as
much
as
my
young
years
would
permit
.
*NL*
I
would
sit
by
her
side
for
hours
,
sewing
diligently
,
with
a
heart
as
free
*NL*
from
care
as
that
of
any
free-born
white
child
.
When
she
thought
I
was
*NL*
tired
,
she
would
send
me
out
to
run
and
jump
;
and
away
I
bounded
,
to
gather
*NL*
berries
or
flowers
to
decorate
her
room
.
Those
were
happy
days
--
too
happy
*NL*
to
last
.
The
slave
child
had
no
thought
for
the
morrow
;
but
there
came
that
*NL*
blight
,
which
too
surely
waits
on
every
human
being
born
to
be
a
chattel
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
was
nearly
twelve
years
old
,
my
kind
mistress
sickened
and
died
.
As
*NL*
I
saw
the
cheek
grow
paler
,
and
the
eye
more
glassy
,
how
earnestly
I
prayed
*NL*
in
my
heart
that
she
might
live
!
I
loved
her
;
for
she
had
been
almost
like
*NL*
a
mother
to
me
.
My
prayers
were
not
answered
.
She
died
,
and
they
buried
her
*NL*
in
the
little
churchyard
,
where
,
day
after
day
,
my
tears
fell
upon
her
*NL*
grave
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
sent
to
spend
a
week
with
my
grandmother
.
I
was
now
old
enough
to
*NL*
begin
to
think
of
the
future
;
and
again
and
again
I
asked
myself
what
they
*NL*
would
do
with
me
.
I
felt
sure
I
should
never
find
another
mistress
so
kind
*NL*
as
the
one
who
was
gone
.
She
had
promised
my
dying
mother
that
her
children
*NL*
should
never
suffer
for
any
thing
;
and
when
I
remembered
that
,
and
recalled
*NL*
her
many
proofs
of
attachment
to
me
,
I
could
not
help
having
some
hopes
*NL*
that
she
had
left
me
free
.
My
friends
were
almost
certain
it
would
be
so
.
*NL*
They
thought
she
would
be
sure
to
do
it
,
on
account
of
my
mother
's
love
and
*NL*
faithful
service
.
But
,
alas
!
we
all
know
that
the
memory
of
a
faithful
*NL*
slave
does
not
avail
much
to
save
her
children
from
the
auction
block
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
brief
period
of
suspense
,
the
will
of
my
mistress
was
read
,
and
we
*NL*
learned
that
she
had
bequeathed
me
to
her
sister
's
daughter
,
a
child
of
*NL*
five
years
old
.
So
vanished
our
hopes
.
My
mistress
had
taught
me
the
*NL*
precepts
of
God
's
Word
:
``
Thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbor
as
thyself
.
''
*NL*
``
Whatsoever
ye
would
that
men
should
do
unto
you
,
do
ye
even
so
unto
them
.
''
*NL*
But
I
was
her
slave
,
and
I
suppose
she
did
not
recognize
me
as
her
*NL*
neighbor
.
I
would
give
much
to
blot
out
from
my
memory
that
one
great
*NL*
wrong
.
As
a
child
,
I
loved
my
mistress
;
and
,
looking
back
on
the
happy
days
*NL*
I
spent
with
her
,
I
try
to
think
with
less
bitterness
of
this
act
of
*NL*
injustice
.
While
I
was
with
her
,
she
taught
me
to
read
and
spell
;
and
for
*NL*
this
privilege
,
which
so
rarely
falls
to
the
lot
of
a
slave
,
I
bless
her
*NL*
memory
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
possessed
but
few
slaves
;
and
at
her
death
those
were
all
distributed
*NL*
among
her
relatives
.
Five
of
them
were
my
grandmother
's
children
,
and
had
*NL*
shared
the
same
milk
that
nourished
her
mother
's
children
.
Notwithstanding
*NL*
my
grandmother
's
long
and
faithful
service
to
her
owners
,
not
one
of
her
*NL*
children
escaped
the
auction
block
.
These
God-breathing
machines
are
no
*NL*
more
,
in
the
sight
of
their
masters
,
than
the
cotton
they
plant
,
or
the
*NL*
horses
they
tend
.

II
.
The
New
Master
And
Mistress
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Flint
,
a
physician
in
the
neighborhood
,
had
married
the
sister
of
my
*NL*
mistress
,
and
I
was
now
the
property
of
their
little
daughter
.
It
was
not
*NL*
without
murmuring
that
I
prepared
for
my
new
home
;
and
what
added
to
my
*NL*
unhappiness
,
was
the
fact
that
my
brother
William
was
purchased
by
the
same
*NL*
family
.
My
father
,
by
his
nature
,
as
well
as
by
the
habit
of
transacting
*NL*
business
as
a
skillful
mechanic
,
had
more
of
the
feelings
of
a
freeman
than
*NL*
is
common
among
slaves
.
My
brother
was
a
spirited
boy
;
and
being
brought
up
*NL*
under
such
influences
,
he
daily
detested
the
name
of
master
and
mistress
.
*NL*
One
day
,
when
his
father
and
his
mistress
both
happened
to
call
him
at
the
*NL*
same
time
,
he
hesitated
between
the
two
;
being
perplexed
to
know
which
had
*NL*
the
strongest
claim
upon
his
obedience
.
He
finally
concluded
to
go
to
his
*NL*
mistress
.
When
my
father
reproved
him
for
it
,
he
said
,
``
You
both
called
me
,
*NL*
and
I
did
n't
know
which
I
ought
to
go
to
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
_
my
_
child
,
''
replied
our
father
,
``
and
when
I
call
you
,
you
should
*NL*
come
immediately
,
if
you
have
to
pass
through
fire
and
water
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Willie
!
He
was
now
to
learn
his
first
lesson
of
obedience
to
a
master
.
*NL*
Grandmother
tried
to
cheer
us
with
hopeful
words
,
and
they
found
an
echo
in
*NL*
the
credulous
hearts
of
youth
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
entered
our
new
home
we
encountered
cold
looks
,
cold
words
,
and
*NL*
cold
treatment
.
We
were
glad
when
the
night
came
.
On
my
narrow
bed
I
moaned
*NL*
and
wept
,
I
felt
so
desolate
and
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
been
there
nearly
a
year
,
when
a
dear
little
friend
of
mine
was
*NL*
buried
.
I
heard
her
mother
sob
,
as
the
clods
fell
on
the
coffin
of
her
only
*NL*
child
,
and
I
turned
away
from
the
grave
,
feeling
thankful
that
I
still
had
*NL*
something
left
to
love
.
I
met
my
grandmother
,
who
said
,
``
Come
with
me
,
*NL*
Linda
;
''
and
from
her
tone
I
knew
that
something
sad
had
happened
.
She
led
*NL*
me
apart
from
the
people
,
and
then
said
,
``
My
child
,
your
father
is
dead
.
''
*NL*
Dead
!
How
could
I
believe
it
?
He
had
died
so
suddenly
I
had
not
even
heard
*NL*
that
he
was
sick
.
I
went
home
with
my
grandmother
.
My
heart
rebelled
*NL*
against
God
,
who
had
taken
from
me
mother
,
father
,
mistress
,
and
friend
.
*NL*
The
good
grandmother
tried
to
comfort
me
.
``
Who
knows
the
ways
of
God
?
''
said
*NL*
she
.
``
Perhaps
they
have
been
kindly
taken
from
the
evil
days
to
come
.
''
*NL*
Years
afterwards
I
often
thought
of
this
.
She
promised
to
be
a
mother
to
*NL*
her
grandchildren
,
so
far
as
she
might
be
permitted
to
do
so
;
and
*NL*
strengthened
by
her
love
,
I
returned
to
my
master
's
.
I
thought
I
should
be
*NL*
allowed
to
go
to
my
father
's
house
the
next
morning
;
but
I
was
ordered
to
*NL*
go
for
flowers
,
that
my
mistress
's
house
might
be
decorated
for
an
evening
*NL*
party
.
I
spent
the
day
gathering
flowers
and
weaving
them
into
festoons
,
*NL*
while
the
dead
body
of
my
father
was
lying
within
a
mile
of
me
.
What
cared
*NL*
my
owners
for
that
?
he
was
merely
a
piece
of
property
.
Moreover
,
they
*NL*
thought
he
had
spoiled
his
children
,
by
teaching
them
to
feel
that
they
*NL*
were
human
beings
.
This
was
blasphemous
doctrine
for
a
slave
to
teach
;
*NL*
presumptuous
in
him
,
and
dangerous
to
the
masters
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
I
followed
his
remains
to
a
humble
grave
beside
that
of
my
*NL*
dear
mother
.
There
were
those
who
knew
my
father
's
worth
,
and
respected
his
*NL*
memory
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
home
now
seemed
more
dreary
than
ever
.
The
laugh
of
the
little
*NL*
slave-children
sounded
harsh
and
cruel
.
It
was
selfish
to
feel
so
about
the
*NL*
joy
of
others
.
My
brother
moved
about
with
a
very
grave
face
.
I
tried
to
*NL*
comfort
him
,
by
saying
,
``
Take
courage
,
Willie
;
brighter
days
will
come
by
*NL*
and
by
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
know
any
thing
about
it
,
Linda
,
''
he
replied
.
``
We
shall
have
to
*NL*
stay
here
all
our
days
;
we
shall
never
be
free
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
argued
that
we
were
growing
older
and
stronger
,
and
that
perhaps
we
*NL*
might
,
before
long
,
be
allowed
to
hire
our
own
time
,
and
then
we
could
earn
*NL*
money
to
buy
our
freedom
.
William
declared
this
was
much
easier
to
say
than
*NL*
to
do
;
moreover
,
he
did
not
intend
to
_
buy
_
his
freedom
.
We
held
daily
*NL*
controversies
upon
this
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
attention
was
paid
to
the
slaves
'
meals
in
Dr.
Flint
's
house
.
If
*NL*
they
could
catch
a
bit
of
food
while
it
was
going
,
well
and
good
.
I
gave
*NL*
myself
no
trouble
on
that
score
,
for
on
my
various
errands
I
passed
my
*NL*
grandmother
's
house
,
where
there
was
always
something
to
spare
for
me
.
I
*NL*
was
frequently
threatened
with
punishment
if
I
stopped
there
;
and
my
*NL*
grandmother
,
to
avoid
detaining
me
,
often
stood
at
the
gate
with
something
*NL*
for
my
breakfast
or
dinner
.
I
was
indebted
to
_
her
_
for
all
my
comforts
,
*NL*
spiritual
or
temporal
.
It
was
_
her
_
labor
that
supplied
my
scanty
wardrobe
.
*NL*
I
have
a
vivid
recollection
of
the
linsey-woolsey
dress
given
me
every
*NL*
winter
by
Mrs.
Flint
.
How
I
hated
it
!
It
was
one
of
the
badges
of
slavery
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
my
grandmother
was
thus
helping
to
support
me
from
her
hard
earnings
,
*NL*
the
three
hundred
dollars
she
had
lent
her
mistress
were
never
repaid
.
When
*NL*
her
mistress
died
,
her
son-in-law
,
Dr.
Flint
,
was
appointed
executor
.
When
*NL*
grandmother
applied
to
him
for
payment
,
he
said
the
estate
was
insolvent
,
*NL*
and
the
law
prohibited
payment
.
It
did
not
,
however
,
prohibit
him
from
*NL*
retaining
the
silver
candelabra
,
which
had
been
purchased
with
that
money
.
*NL*
I
presume
they
will
be
handed
down
in
the
family
,
from
generation
to
*NL*
generation
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
grandmother
's
mistress
had
always
promised
her
that
,
at
her
death
,
she
*NL*
should
be
free
;
and
it
was
said
that
in
her
will
she
made
good
the
promise
.
*NL*
But
when
the
estate
was
settled
,
Dr.
Flint
told
the
faithful
old
servant
*NL*
that
,
under
existing
circumstances
,
it
was
necessary
she
should
be
sold
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
appointed
day
,
the
customary
advertisement
was
posted
up
,
*NL*
proclaiming
that
there
would
be
a
``
public
sale
of
negroes
,
horses
,
&
c.
''
Dr.
*NL*
Flint
called
to
tell
my
grandmother
that
he
was
unwilling
to
wound
her
*NL*
feelings
by
putting
her
up
at
auction
,
and
that
he
would
prefer
to
dispose
*NL*
of
her
at
private
sale
.
My
grandmother
saw
through
his
hypocrisy
;
she
*NL*
understood
very
well
that
he
was
ashamed
of
the
job
.
She
was
a
very
*NL*
spirited
woman
,
and
if
he
was
base
enough
to
sell
her
,
when
her
mistress
*NL*
intended
she
should
be
free
,
she
was
determined
the
public
should
know
it
.
*NL*
She
had
for
a
long
time
supplied
many
families
with
crackers
and
preserves
;
*NL*
consequently
,
``
Aunt
Marthy
,
''
as
she
was
called
,
was
generally
known
,
and
*NL*
every
body
who
knew
her
respected
her
intelligence
and
good
character
.
Her
*NL*
long
and
faithful
service
in
the
family
was
also
well
known
,
and
the
*NL*
intention
of
her
mistress
to
leave
her
free
.
When
the
day
of
sale
came
,
she
*NL*
took
her
place
among
the
chattels
,
and
at
the
first
call
she
sprang
upon
*NL*
the
auction-block
.
Many
voices
called
out
,
``
Shame
!
Shame
!
Who
is
going
to
*NL*
sell
_
you
_
,
aunt
Marthy
?
Do
n't
stand
there
!
That
is
no
place
for
_
you
_
.
''
*NL*
Without
saying
a
word
,
she
quietly
awaited
her
fate
.
No
one
bid
for
her
.
At
*NL*
last
,
a
feeble
voice
said
,
``
Fifty
dollars
.
''
It
came
from
a
maiden
lady
,
*NL*
seventy
years
old
,
the
sister
of
my
grandmother
's
deceased
mistress
.
She
*NL*
had
lived
forty
years
under
the
same
roof
with
my
grandmother
;
she
knew
how
*NL*
faithfully
she
had
served
her
owners
,
and
how
cruelly
she
had
been
*NL*
defrauded
of
her
rights
;
and
she
resolved
to
protect
her
.
The
auctioneer
*NL*
waited
for
a
higher
bid
;
but
her
wishes
were
respected
;
no
one
bid
above
*NL*
her
.
She
could
neither
read
nor
write
;
and
when
the
bill
of
sale
was
made
*NL*
out
,
she
signed
it
with
a
cross
.
But
what
consequence
was
that
,
when
she
*NL*
had
a
big
heart
overflowing
with
human
kindness
?
She
gave
the
old
servant
*NL*
her
freedom
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
time
,
my
grandmother
was
just
fifty
years
old
.
Laborious
years
had
*NL*
passed
since
then
;
and
now
my
brother
and
I
were
slaves
to
the
man
who
had
*NL*
defrauded
her
of
her
money
,
and
tried
to
defraud
her
of
her
freedom
.
One
of
*NL*
my
mother
's
sisters
,
called
Aunt
Nancy
,
was
also
a
slave
in
his
family
.
She
*NL*
was
a
kind
,
good
aunt
to
me
;
and
supplied
the
place
of
both
housekeeper
and
*NL*
waiting
maid
to
her
mistress
.
She
was
,
in
fact
,
at
the
beginning
and
end
of
*NL*
every
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Flint
,
like
many
southern
women
,
was
totally
deficient
in
energy
.
She
*NL*
had
not
strength
to
superintend
her
household
affairs
;
but
her
nerves
were
*NL*
so
strong
,
that
she
could
sit
in
her
easy
chair
and
see
a
woman
whipped
,
*NL*
till
the
blood
trickled
from
every
stroke
of
the
lash
.
She
was
a
member
of
*NL*
the
church
;
but
partaking
of
the
Lord
's
supper
did
not
seem
to
put
her
in
a
*NL*
Christian
frame
of
mind
.
If
dinner
was
not
served
at
the
exact
time
on
that
*NL*
particular
Sunday
,
she
would
station
herself
in
the
kitchen
,
and
wait
till
*NL*
it
was
dished
,
and
then
spit
in
all
the
kettles
and
pans
that
had
been
used
*NL*
for
cooking
.
She
did
this
to
prevent
the
cook
and
her
children
from
eking
*NL*
out
their
meagre
fare
with
the
remains
of
the
gravy
and
other
scrapings
.
*NL*
The
slaves
could
get
nothing
to
eat
except
what
she
chose
to
give
them
.
*NL*
Provisions
were
weighed
out
by
the
pound
and
ounce
,
three
times
a
day
.
I
*NL*
can
assure
you
she
gave
them
no
chance
to
eat
wheat
bread
from
her
flour
*NL*
barrel
.
She
knew
how
many
biscuits
a
quart
of
flour
would
make
,
and
exactly
*NL*
what
size
they
ought
to
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Flint
was
an
epicure
.
The
cook
never
sent
a
dinner
to
his
table
without
*NL*
fear
and
trembling
;
for
if
there
happened
to
be
a
dish
not
to
his
liking
,
*NL*
he
would
either
order
her
to
be
whipped
,
or
compel
her
to
eat
every
*NL*
mouthful
of
it
in
his
presence
.
The
poor
,
hungry
creature
might
not
have
*NL*
objected
to
eating
it
;
but
she
did
object
to
having
her
master
cram
it
*NL*
down
her
throat
till
she
choked
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
a
pet
dog
,
that
was
a
nuisance
in
the
house
.
The
cook
was
ordered
*NL*
to
make
some
Indian
mush
for
him
.
He
refused
to
eat
,
and
when
his
head
was
*NL*
held
over
it
,
the
froth
flowed
from
his
mouth
into
the
basin
.
He
died
a
few
*NL*
minutes
after
.
When
Dr.
Flint
came
in
,
he
said
the
mush
had
not
been
well
*NL*
cooked
,
and
that
was
the
reason
the
animal
would
not
eat
it
.
He
sent
for
*NL*
the
cook
,
and
compelled
her
to
eat
it
.
He
thought
that
the
woman
's
stomach
*NL*
was
stronger
than
the
dog
's
;
but
her
sufferings
afterwards
proved
that
he
*NL*
was
mistaken
.
This
poor
woman
endured
many
cruelties
from
her
master
and
*NL*
mistress
;
sometimes
she
was
locked
up
,
away
from
her
nursing
baby
,
for
a
*NL*
whole
day
and
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
had
been
in
the
family
a
few
weeks
,
one
of
the
plantation
slaves
was
*NL*
brought
to
town
,
by
order
of
his
master
.
It
was
near
night
when
he
arrived
,
*NL*
and
Dr.
Flint
ordered
him
to
be
taken
to
the
work
house
,
and
tied
up
to
the
*NL*
joist
,
so
that
his
feet
would
just
escape
the
ground
.
In
that
situation
he
*NL*
was
to
wait
till
the
doctor
had
taken
his
tea
.
I
shall
never
forget
*NL*
that
night
.
Never
before
,
in
my
life
,
had
I
heard
hundreds
of
blows
fall
;
*NL*
in
succession
,
on
a
human
being
.
His
piteous
groans
,
and
his
``
O
,
pray
*NL*
do
n't
,
massa
,
''
rang
in
my
ear
for
months
afterwards
.
There
were
many
*NL*
conjectures
as
to
the
cause
of
this
terrible
punishment
.
Some
said
master
*NL*
accused
him
of
stealing
corn
;
others
said
the
slave
had
quarrelled
with
his
*NL*
wife
,
in
presence
of
the
overseer
,
and
had
accused
his
master
of
being
the
*NL*
father
of
her
child
.
They
were
both
black
,
and
the
child
was
very
fair
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
into
the
work
house
next
morning
,
and
saw
the
cowhide
still
wet
with
*NL*
blood
,
and
the
boards
all
covered
with
gore
.
The
poor
man
lived
,
and
*NL*
continued
to
quarrel
with
his
wife
.
A
few
months
afterwards
Dr.
Flint
*NL*
handed
them
both
over
to
a
slave-trader
.
The
guilty
man
put
their
value
*NL*
into
his
pocket
,
and
had
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
they
were
out
of
*NL*
sight
and
hearing
.
When
the
mother
was
delivered
into
the
trader
's
hands
,
*NL*
she
said
.
``
You
_
promised
_
to
treat
me
well
.
''
To
which
he
replied
,
``
You
have
*NL*
let
your
tongue
run
too
far
;
damn
you
!
''
She
had
forgotten
that
it
was
a
*NL*
crime
for
a
slave
to
tell
who
was
the
father
of
her
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
others
than
the
master
persecution
also
comes
in
such
cases
.
I
once
*NL*
saw
a
young
slave
girl
dying
soon
after
the
birth
of
a
child
nearly
white
.
*NL*
In
her
agony
she
cried
out
,
``
O
Lord
,
come
and
take
me
!
''
Her
mistress
stood
*NL*
by
,
and
mocked
at
her
like
an
incarnate
fiend
.
``
You
suffer
,
do
you
?
''
she
*NL*
exclaimed
.
``
I
am
glad
of
it
.
You
deserve
it
all
,
and
more
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
's
mother
said
,
``
The
baby
is
dead
,
thank
God
;
and
I
hope
my
poor
*NL*
child
will
soon
be
in
heaven
,
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heaven
!
''
retorted
the
mistress
.
``
There
is
no
such
place
for
the
like
of
*NL*
her
and
her
bastard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
mother
turned
away
,
sobbing
.
Her
dying
daughter
called
her
,
*NL*
feebly
,
and
as
she
bent
over
her
,
I
heard
her
say
,
``
Do
n't
grieve
so
,
*NL*
mother
;
God
knows
all
about
it
;
and
HE
will
have
mercy
upon
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
sufferings
,
afterwards
,
became
so
intense
,
that
her
mistress
felt
*NL*
unable
to
stay
;
but
when
she
left
the
room
,
the
scornful
smile
was
still
on
*NL*
her
lips
.
Seven
children
called
her
mother
.
The
poor
black
woman
had
but
*NL*
the
one
child
,
whose
eyes
she
saw
closing
in
death
,
while
she
thanked
God
*NL*
for
taking
her
away
from
the
greater
bitterness
of
life
.

III
.
The
Slaves
'
New
Year
's
Day
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Flint
owned
a
fine
residence
in
town
,
several
farms
,
and
about
fifty
*NL*
slaves
,
besides
hiring
a
number
by
the
year
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hiring-day
at
the
south
takes
place
on
the
1st
of
January
.
On
the
2d
,
the
*NL*
slaves
are
expected
to
go
to
their
new
masters
.
On
a
farm
,
they
work
until
*NL*
the
corn
and
cotton
are
laid
.
They
then
have
two
holidays
.
Some
masters
*NL*
give
them
a
good
dinner
under
the
trees
.
This
over
,
they
work
until
*NL*
Christmas
eve
.
If
no
heavy
charges
are
meantime
brought
against
them
,
they
*NL*
are
given
four
or
five
holidays
,
whichever
the
master
or
overseer
may
think
*NL*
proper
.
Then
comes
New
Year
's
eve
;
and
they
gather
together
their
little
*NL*
alls
,
or
more
properly
speaking
,
their
little
nothings
,
and
wait
anxiously
*NL*
for
the
dawning
of
day
.
At
the
appointed
hour
the
grounds
are
thronged
with
*NL*
men
,
women
,
and
children
,
waiting
,
like
criminals
,
to
hear
their
doom
*NL*
pronounced
.
The
slave
is
sure
to
know
who
is
the
most
humane
,
or
cruel
*NL*
master
,
within
forty
miles
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
easy
to
find
out
,
on
that
day
,
who
clothes
and
feeds
his
slaves
well
;
*NL*
for
he
is
surrounded
by
a
crowd
,
begging
,
``
Please
,
massa
,
hire
me
this
*NL*
year
.
I
will
work
_
very
_
hard
,
massa
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
a
slave
is
unwilling
to
go
with
his
new
master
,
he
is
whipped
,
or
locked
*NL*
up
in
jail
,
until
he
consents
to
go
,
and
promises
not
to
run
away
during
*NL*
the
year
.
Should
he
chance
to
change
his
mind
,
thinking
it
justifiable
to
*NL*
violate
an
extorted
promise
,
woe
unto
him
if
he
is
caught
!
The
whip
is
used
*NL*
till
the
blood
flows
at
his
feet
;
and
his
stiffened
limbs
are
put
in
*NL*
chains
,
to
be
dragged
in
the
field
for
days
and
days
!
*NL*
*NL*
If
he
lives
until
the
next
year
,
perhaps
the
same
man
will
hire
him
again
,
*NL*
without
even
giving
him
an
opportunity
of
going
to
the
hiring-ground
.
After
*NL*
those
for
hire
are
disposed
of
,
those
for
sale
are
called
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
O
,
you
happy
free
women
,
contrast
_
your
_
New
Year
's
day
with
that
of
the
*NL*
poor
bond-woman
!
With
you
it
is
a
pleasant
season
,
and
the
light
of
the
day
*NL*
is
blessed
.
Friendly
wishes
meet
you
every
where
,
and
gifts
are
showered
*NL*
upon
you
.
Even
hearts
that
have
been
estranged
from
you
soften
at
this
*NL*
season
,
and
lips
that
have
been
silent
echo
back
,
``
I
wish
you
a
happy
New
*NL*
Year
.
''
Children
bring
their
little
offerings
,
and
raise
their
rosy
lips
for
*NL*
a
caress
.
They
are
your
own
,
and
no
hand
but
that
of
death
can
take
them
*NL*
from
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
to
the
slave
mother
New
Year
's
day
comes
laden
with
peculiar
sorrows
.
*NL*
She
sits
on
her
cold
cabin
floor
,
watching
the
children
who
may
all
be
torn
*NL*
from
her
the
next
morning
;
and
often
does
she
wish
that
she
and
they
might
*NL*
die
before
the
day
dawns
.
She
may
be
an
ignorant
creature
,
degraded
by
the
*NL*
system
that
has
brutalized
her
from
childhood
;
but
she
has
a
mother
's
*NL*
instincts
,
and
is
capable
of
feeling
a
mother
's
agonies
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
one
of
these
sale
days
,
I
saw
a
mother
lead
seven
children
to
the
*NL*
auction-block
.
She
knew
that
_
some
_
of
them
would
be
taken
from
her
;
but
*NL*
they
took
_
all
_
.
The
children
were
sold
to
a
slave-trader
,
and
their
mother
*NL*
was
bought
by
a
man
in
her
own
town
.
Before
night
her
children
were
all
*NL*
far
away
.
She
begged
the
trader
to
tell
her
where
he
intended
to
take
them
;
*NL*
this
he
refused
to
do
.
How
_
could
_
he
,
when
he
knew
he
would
sell
them
,
one
*NL*
by
one
,
wherever
he
could
command
the
highest
price
?
I
met
that
mother
in
*NL*
the
street
,
and
her
wild
,
haggard
face
lives
to-day
in
my
mind
.
She
wrung
*NL*
her
hands
in
anguish
,
and
exclaimed
,
``
Gone
!
All
gone
!
Why
_
do
n't
_
God
kill
*NL*
me
?
''
I
had
no
words
wherewith
to
comfort
her
.
Instances
of
this
kind
are
of
*NL*
daily
,
yea
,
of
hourly
occurrence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Slaveholders
have
a
method
,
peculiar
to
their
institution
,
of
getting
rid
*NL*
of
_
old
_
slaves
,
whose
lives
have
been
worn
out
in
their
service
.
I
knew
an
*NL*
old
woman
,
who
for
seventy
years
faithfully
served
her
master
.
She
had
*NL*
become
almost
helpless
,
from
hard
labor
and
disease
.
Her
owners
moved
to
*NL*
Alabama
,
and
the
old
black
woman
was
left
to
be
sold
to
any
body
who
would
*NL*
give
twenty
dollars
for
her
.

The
Slave
Who
Dared
To
Feel
Like
A
Man
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Two
years
had
passed
since
I
entered
Dr.
Flint
's
family
,
and
those
years
*NL*
had
brought
much
of
the
knowledge
that
comes
from
experience
,
though
they
*NL*
had
afforded
little
opportunity
for
any
other
kinds
of
knowledge
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
grandmother
had
,
as
much
as
possible
,
been
a
mother
to
her
orphan
*NL*
grandchildren
.
By
perseverance
and
unwearied
industry
,
she
was
now
mistress
*NL*
of
a
snug
little
home
,
surrounded
with
the
necessaries
of
life
.
She
would
*NL*
have
been
happy
could
her
children
have
shared
them
with
her
.
There
*NL*
remained
but
three
children
and
two
grandchildren
,
all
slaves
.
Most
*NL*
earnestly
did
she
strive
to
make
us
feel
that
it
was
the
will
of
God
:
that
*NL*
He
had
seen
fit
to
place
us
under
such
circumstances
;
and
though
it
seemed
*NL*
hard
,
we
ought
to
pray
for
contentment
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
beautiful
faith
,
coming
from
a
mother
who
could
not
call
her
*NL*
children
her
own
.
But
I
,
and
Benjamin
,
her
youngest
boy
,
condemned
it
.
We
*NL*
reasoned
that
it
was
much
more
the
will
of
God
that
we
should
be
situated
*NL*
as
she
was
.
We
longed
for
a
home
like
hers
.
There
we
always
found
sweet
*NL*
balsam
for
our
troubles
.
She
was
so
loving
,
so
sympathizing
!
She
always
met
*NL*
us
with
a
smile
,
and
listened
with
patience
to
all
our
sorrows
.
She
spoke
*NL*
so
hopefully
,
that
unconsciously
the
clouds
gave
place
to
sunshine
.
There
*NL*
was
a
grand
big
oven
there
,
too
,
that
baked
bread
and
nice
things
for
the
*NL*
town
,
and
we
knew
there
was
always
a
choice
bit
in
store
for
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
alas
!
Even
the
charms
of
the
old
oven
failed
to
reconcile
us
to
our
*NL*
hard
lot
.
Benjamin
was
now
a
tall
,
handsome
lad
,
strongly
and
gracefully
*NL*
made
,
and
with
a
spirit
too
bold
and
daring
for
a
slave
.
My
brother
*NL*
William
,
now
twelve
years
old
,
had
the
same
aversion
to
the
word
master
*NL*
that
he
had
when
he
was
an
urchin
of
seven
years
.
I
was
his
confidant
.
He
*NL*
came
to
me
with
all
his
troubles
.
I
remember
one
instance
in
particular
.
It
*NL*
was
on
a
lovely
spring
morning
,
and
when
I
marked
the
sunlight
dancing
here
*NL*
and
there
,
its
beauty
seemed
to
mock
my
sadness
.
For
my
master
,
whose
*NL*
restless
,
craving
,
vicious
nature
roved
about
day
and
night
,
seeking
whom
*NL*
to
devour
,
had
just
left
me
,
with
stinging
,
scorching
words
;
words
that
*NL*
scathed
ear
and
brain
like
fire
.
O
,
how
I
despised
him
!
I
thought
how
glad
*NL*
I
should
be
,
if
some
day
when
he
walked
the
earth
,
it
would
open
and
*NL*
swallow
him
up
,
and
disencumber
the
world
of
a
plague
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
told
me
that
I
was
made
for
his
use
,
made
to
obey
his
command
in
*NL*
_
every
_
thing
;
that
I
was
nothing
but
a
slave
,
whose
will
must
and
should
*NL*
surrender
to
his
,
never
before
had
my
puny
arm
felt
half
so
strong
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
deeply
was
I
absorbed
in
painful
reflections
afterwards
,
that
I
neither
*NL*
saw
nor
heard
the
entrance
of
any
one
,
till
the
voice
of
William
sounded
*NL*
close
beside
me
.
``
Linda
,
''
said
he
,
``
what
makes
you
look
so
sad
?
I
love
you
.
*NL*
O
,
Linda
,
is
n't
this
a
bad
world
?
Every
body
seems
so
cross
and
unhappy
.
I
*NL*
wish
I
had
died
when
poor
father
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
that
every
body
was
_
not
_
cross
,
or
unhappy
;
that
those
who
had
*NL*
pleasant
homes
,
and
kind
friends
,
and
who
were
not
afraid
to
love
them
,
*NL*
were
happy
.
But
we
,
who
were
slave-children
,
without
father
or
mother
,
*NL*
could
not
expect
to
be
happy
.
We
must
be
good
;
perhaps
that
would
bring
us
*NL*
contentment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
try
to
be
good
;
but
what
's
the
use
?
They
are
all
the
*NL*
time
troubling
me
.
''
Then
he
proceeded
to
relate
his
afternoon
's
difficulty
*NL*
with
young
master
Nicholas
.
It
seemed
that
the
brother
of
master
Nicholas
*NL*
had
pleased
himself
with
making
up
stories
about
William
.
Master
Nicholas
*NL*
said
he
should
be
flogged
,
and
he
would
do
it
.
Whereupon
he
went
to
work
;
*NL*
but
William
fought
bravely
,
and
the
young
master
,
finding
he
was
getting
*NL*
the
better
of
him
,
undertook
to
tie
his
hands
behind
him
.
He
failed
in
that
*NL*
likewise
.
By
dint
of
kicking
and
fisting
,
William
came
out
of
the
skirmish
*NL*
none
the
worse
for
a
few
scratches
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
continued
to
discourse
,
on
his
young
master
's
_
meanness
_
;
how
he
whipped
*NL*
the
_
little
_
boys
,
but
was
a
perfect
coward
when
a
tussle
ensued
between
*NL*
him
and
white
boys
of
his
own
size
.
On
such
occasions
he
always
took
to
his
*NL*
legs
.
William
had
other
charges
to
make
against
him
.
One
was
his
rubbing
up
*NL*
pennies
with
quicksilver
,
and
passing
them
off
for
quarters
of
a
dollar
on
*NL*
an
old
man
who
kept
a
fruit
stall
.
William
was
often
sent
to
buy
fruit
,
and
*NL*
he
earnestly
inquired
of
me
what
he
ought
to
do
under
such
circumstances
.
I
*NL*
told
him
it
was
certainly
wrong
to
deceive
the
old
man
,
and
that
it
was
his
*NL*
duty
to
tell
him
of
the
impositions
practised
by
his
young
master
.
I
*NL*
assured
him
the
old
man
would
not
be
slow
to
comprehend
the
whole
,
and
*NL*
there
the
matter
would
end
.
William
thought
it
might
with
the
old
man
,
but
*NL*
not
with
_
him
_
.
He
said
he
did
not
mind
the
smart
of
the
whip
,
but
he
did
*NL*
not
like
the
_
idea
_
of
being
whipped
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
I
advised
him
to
be
good
and
forgiving
I
was
not
unconscious
of
the
*NL*
beam
in
my
own
eye
.
It
was
the
very
knowledge
of
my
own
shortcomings
that
*NL*
urged
me
to
retain
,
if
possible
,
some
sparks
of
my
brother
's
God-given
*NL*
nature
.
I
had
not
lived
fourteen
years
in
slavery
for
nothing
.
I
had
felt
,
*NL*
seen
,
and
heard
enough
,
to
read
the
characters
,
and
question
the
motives
,
*NL*
of
those
around
me
.
The
war
of
my
life
had
begun
;
and
though
one
of
God
's
*NL*
most
powerless
creatures
,
I
resolved
never
to
be
conquered
.
Alas
,
for
me
!
*NL*
*NL*
If
there
was
one
pure
,
sunny
spot
for
me
,
I
believed
it
to
be
in
Benjamin
's
*NL*
heart
,
and
in
another
's
,
whom
I
loved
with
all
the
ardor
of
a
girl
's
first
*NL*
love
.
My
owner
knew
of
it
,
and
sought
in
every
way
to
render
me
miserable
.
*NL*
He
did
not
resort
to
corporal
punishment
,
but
to
all
the
petty
,
tyrannical
*NL*
ways
that
human
ingenuity
could
devise
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
remember
the
first
time
I
was
punished
.
It
was
in
the
month
of
February
.
*NL*
My
grandmother
had
taken
my
old
shoes
,
and
replaced
them
with
a
new
pair
.
I
*NL*
needed
them
;
for
several
inches
of
snow
had
fallen
,
and
it
still
continued
*NL*
to
fall
.
When
I
walked
through
Mrs.
Flint
's
room
,
their
creaking
grated
*NL*
harshly
on
her
refined
nerves
.
She
called
me
to
her
,
and
asked
what
I
had
*NL*
about
me
that
made
such
a
horrid
noise
.
I
told
her
it
was
my
new
shoes
.
*NL*
``
Take
them
off
,
''
said
she
;
``
and
if
you
put
them
on
again
,
I
'll
throw
them
*NL*
into
the
fire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
them
off
,
and
my
stockings
also
.
She
then
sent
me
a
long
distance
,
*NL*
on
an
errand
.
As
I
went
through
the
snow
,
my
bare
feet
tingled
.
That
night
*NL*
I
was
very
hoarse
;
and
I
went
to
bed
thinking
the
next
day
would
find
me
*NL*
sick
,
perhaps
dead
.
What
was
my
grief
on
waking
to
find
myself
quite
well
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
imagined
if
I
died
,
or
was
laid
up
for
some
time
,
that
my
mistress
*NL*
would
feel
a
twinge
of
remorse
that
she
had
so
hated
``
the
little
imp
,
''
as
*NL*
she
styled
me
.
It
was
my
ignorance
of
that
mistress
that
gave
rise
to
such
*NL*
extravagant
imaginings
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Flint
occasionally
had
high
prices
offered
for
me
;
but
he
always
said
,
*NL*
``
She
do
n't
belong
to
me
.
She
is
my
daughter
's
property
,
and
I
have
no
right
*NL*
to
sell
her
.
''
Good
,
honest
man
!
My
young
mistress
was
still
a
child
,
and
I
*NL*
could
look
for
no
protection
from
her
.
I
loved
her
,
and
she
returned
my
*NL*
affection
.
I
once
heard
her
father
allude
to
her
attachment
to
me
,
and
his
*NL*
wife
promptly
replied
that
it
proceeded
from
fear
.
This
put
unpleasant
*NL*
doubts
into
my
mind
.
Did
the
child
feign
what
she
did
not
feel
?
or
was
her
*NL*
mother
jealous
of
the
mite
of
love
she
bestowed
on
me
?
I
concluded
it
must
*NL*
be
the
latter
.
I
said
to
myself
,
``
Surely
,
little
children
are
true
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
afternoon
I
sat
at
my
sewing
,
feeling
unusual
depression
of
spirits
.
My
*NL*
mistress
had
been
accusing
me
of
an
offence
,
of
which
I
assured
her
I
was
*NL*
perfectly
innocent
;
but
I
saw
,
by
the
contemptuous
curl
of
her
lip
,
that
*NL*
she
believed
I
was
telling
a
lie
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
wondered
for
what
wise
purpose
God
was
leading
me
through
such
thorny
*NL*
paths
,
and
whether
still
darker
days
were
in
store
for
me
.
As
I
sat
musing
*NL*
thus
,
the
door
opened
softly
,
and
William
came
in
.
``
Well
,
brother
,
''
said
I
,
*NL*
``
what
is
the
matter
this
time
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
Linda
,
Ben
and
his
master
have
had
a
dreadful
time
!
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
first
thought
was
that
Benjamin
was
killed
.
``
Do
n't
be
frightened
,
*NL*
Linda
,
''
said
William
;
``
I
will
tell
you
all
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
appeared
that
Benjamin
's
master
had
sent
for
him
,
and
he
did
not
*NL*
immediately
obey
the
summons
.
When
he
did
,
his
master
was
angry
,
and
began
*NL*
to
whip
him
.
He
resisted
.
Master
and
slave
fought
,
and
finally
the
master
*NL*
was
thrown
.
Benjamin
had
cause
to
tremble
;
for
he
had
thrown
to
the
ground
*NL*
his
master
--
one
of
the
richest
men
in
town
.
I
anxiously
awaited
the
*NL*
result
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
night
I
stole
to
my
grandmother
's
house
;
and
Benjamin
also
stole
*NL*
thither
from
his
master
's
.
My
grandmother
had
gone
to
spend
a
day
or
two
*NL*
with
an
old
friend
living
in
the
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
come
,
''
said
Benjamin
,
``
to
tell
you
good
by
.
I
am
going
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
inquired
where
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
north
,
''
he
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
looked
at
him
to
see
whether
he
was
in
earnest
.
I
saw
it
all
in
his
firm
,
*NL*
set
mouth
.
I
implored
him
not
to
go
,
but
he
paid
no
heed
to
my
words
.
He
*NL*
said
he
was
no
longer
a
boy
,
and
every
day
made
his
yoke
more
galling
.
He
*NL*
had
raised
his
hand
against
his
master
,
and
was
to
be
publicly
whipped
for
*NL*
the
offence
.
I
reminded
him
of
the
poverty
and
hardships
he
must
encounter
*NL*
among
strangers
.
I
told
him
he
might
be
caught
and
brought
back
;
and
that
*NL*
was
terrible
to
think
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
grew
vexed
,
and
asked
if
poverty
and
hardships
with
freedom
,
were
not
*NL*
preferable
to
our
treatment
in
slavery
.
``
Linda
,
''
he
continued
,
``
we
are
dogs
*NL*
here
;
foot-balls
,
cattle
,
every
thing
that
's
mean
.
No
,
I
will
not
stay
.
Let
*NL*
them
bring
me
back
.
We
do
n't
die
but
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
right
;
but
it
was
hard
to
give
him
up
.
``
Go
,
''
said
I
,
``
and
break
your
*NL*
mother
's
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
repented
of
my
words
ere
they
were
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Linda
,
''
said
he
,
speaking
as
I
had
not
heard
him
speak
that
evening
,
``
how
*NL*
_
could
_
you
say
that
?
Poor
mother
!
be
kind
to
her
,
Linda
;
and
you
,
too
,
*NL*
cousin
Fanny
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cousin
Fanny
was
a
friend
who
had
lived
some
years
with
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
Farewells
were
exchanged
,
and
the
bright
,
kind
boy
,
endeared
to
us
by
so
*NL*
many
acts
of
love
,
vanished
from
our
sight
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
not
necessary
to
state
how
he
made
his
escape
.
Suffice
it
to
say
,
he
*NL*
was
on
his
way
to
New
York
when
a
violent
storm
overtook
the
vessel
.
The
*NL*
captain
said
he
must
put
into
the
nearest
port
.
This
alarmed
Benjamin
,
who
*NL*
was
aware
that
he
would
be
advertised
in
every
port
near
his
own
town
.
His
*NL*
embarrassment
was
noticed
by
the
captain
.
To
port
they
went
.
There
the
*NL*
advertisement
met
the
captain
's
eye
.
Benjamin
so
exactly
answered
its
*NL*
description
,
that
the
captain
laid
hold
on
him
,
and
bound
him
in
chains
.
*NL*
The
storm
passed
,
and
they
proceeded
to
New
York
.
Before
reaching
that
port
*NL*
Benjamin
managed
to
get
off
his
chains
and
throw
them
overboard
.
He
escaped
*NL*
from
the
vessel
,
but
was
pursued
,
captured
,
and
carried
back
to
his
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
my
grandmother
returned
home
and
found
her
youngest
child
had
fled
,
*NL*
great
was
her
sorrow
;
but
,
with
characteristic
piety
,
she
said
,
``
God
's
will
*NL*
be
done
.
''
Each
morning
,
she
inquired
if
any
news
had
been
heard
from
her
*NL*
boy
.
Yes
,
news
_
was
_
heard
.
The
master
was
rejoicing
over
a
letter
,
*NL*
announcing
the
capture
of
his
human
chattel
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
day
seems
but
as
yesterday
,
so
well
do
I
remember
it
.
I
saw
him
led
*NL*
through
the
streets
in
chains
,
to
jail
.
His
face
was
ghastly
pale
,
yet
full
*NL*
of
determination
.
He
had
begged
one
of
the
sailors
to
go
to
his
mother
's
*NL*
house
and
ask
her
not
to
meet
him
.
He
said
the
sight
of
her
distress
would
*NL*
take
from
him
all
self-control
.
She
yearned
to
see
him
,
and
she
went
;
but
*NL*
she
screened
herself
in
the
crowd
,
that
it
might
be
as
her
child
had
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
not
allowed
to
visit
him
;
but
we
had
known
the
jailer
for
years
,
*NL*
and
he
was
a
kind-hearted
man
.
At
midnight
he
opened
the
jail
door
for
my
*NL*
grandmother
and
myself
to
enter
,
in
disguise
.
When
we
entered
the
cell
not
*NL*
a
sound
broke
the
stillness
.
``
Benjamin
,
Benjamin
!
''
whispered
my
*NL*
grandmother
.
No
answer
.
``
Benjamin
!
''
she
again
faltered
.
There
was
a
jingle
*NL*
of
chains
.
The
moon
had
just
risen
,
and
cast
an
uncertain
light
through
the
*NL*
bars
of
the
window
.
We
knelt
down
and
took
Benjamin
's
cold
hands
in
ours
.
*NL*
We
did
not
speak
.
Sobs
were
heard
,
and
Benjamin
's
lips
were
unsealed
;
for
*NL*
his
mother
was
weeping
on
his
neck
.
How
vividly
does
memory
bring
back
that
*NL*
sad
night
!
Mother
and
son
talked
together
.
He
asked
her
pardon
for
the
*NL*
suffering
he
had
caused
her
.
She
said
she
had
nothing
to
forgive
;
she
could
*NL*
not
blame
his
desire
for
freedom
.
He
told
her
that
when
he
was
captured
,
he
*NL*
broke
away
,
and
was
about
casting
himself
into
the
river
,
when
thoughts
of
*NL*
_
her
_
came
over
him
,
and
he
desisted
.
She
asked
if
he
did
not
also
think
of
*NL*
God
.
I
fancied
I
saw
his
face
grow
fierce
in
the
moonlight
.
He
answered
,
*NL*
``
No
,
I
did
not
think
of
him
.
When
a
man
is
hunted
like
a
wild
beast
he
*NL*
forgets
there
is
a
God
,
a
heaven
.
He
forgets
every
thing
in
his
struggle
to
*NL*
get
beyond
the
reach
of
the
bloodhounds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
talk
so
,
Benjamin
,
''
said
she
.
``
Put
your
trust
in
God
.
Be
humble
,
my
*NL*
child
,
and
your
master
will
forgive
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forgive
me
for
_
what
_
,
mother
?
For
not
letting
him
treat
me
like
a
dog
?
*NL*
No
!
I
will
never
humble
myself
to
him
.
I
have
worked
for
him
for
nothing
*NL*
all
my
life
,
and
I
am
repaid
with
stripes
and
imprisonment
.
Here
I
will
*NL*
stay
till
I
die
,
or
till
he
sells
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
mother
shuddered
at
his
words
.
I
think
he
felt
it
;
for
when
he
*NL*
next
spoke
,
his
voice
was
calmer
.
``
Do
n't
fret
about
me
,
mother
.
I
ai
n't
*NL*
worth
it
,
''
said
he
.
``
I
wish
I
had
some
of
your
goodness
.
You
bear
every
*NL*
thing
patiently
,
just
as
though
you
thought
it
was
all
right
.
I
wish
I
*NL*
could
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
told
him
she
had
not
always
been
so
;
once
,
she
was
like
him
;
but
when
*NL*
sore
troubles
came
upon
her
,
and
she
had
no
arm
to
lean
upon
,
she
learned
*NL*
to
call
on
God
,
and
he
lightened
her
burdens
.
She
besought
him
to
do
*NL*
likewise
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
overstaid
our
time
,
and
were
obliged
to
hurry
from
the
jail
.
*NL*
*NL*
Benjamin
had
been
imprisoned
three
weeks
,
when
my
grandmother
went
to
*NL*
intercede
for
him
with
his
master
.
He
was
immovable
.
He
said
Benjamin
*NL*
should
serve
as
an
example
to
the
rest
of
his
slaves
;
he
should
be
kept
in
*NL*
jail
till
he
was
subdued
,
or
be
sold
if
he
got
but
one
dollar
for
him
.
*NL*
However
,
he
afterwards
relented
in
some
degree
.
The
chains
were
taken
off
,
*NL*
and
we
were
allowed
to
visit
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
his
food
was
of
the
coarsest
kind
,
we
carried
him
as
often
as
possible
a
*NL*
warm
supper
,
accompanied
with
some
little
luxury
for
the
jailer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Three
months
elapsed
,
and
there
was
no
prospect
of
release
or
of
a
*NL*
purchaser
.
One
day
he
was
heard
to
sing
and
laugh
.
This
piece
of
indecorum
*NL*
was
told
to
his
master
,
and
the
overseer
was
ordered
to
re-chain
him
.
He
*NL*
was
now
confined
in
an
apartment
with
other
prisoners
,
who
were
covered
*NL*
with
filthy
rags
.
Benjamin
was
chained
near
them
,
and
was
soon
covered
with
*NL*
vermin
.
He
worked
at
his
chains
till
he
succeeded
in
getting
out
of
them
.
*NL*
He
passed
them
through
the
bars
of
the
window
,
with
a
request
that
they
*NL*
should
be
taken
to
his
master
,
and
he
should
be
informed
that
he
was
*NL*
covered
with
vermin
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
audacity
was
punished
with
heavier
chains
,
and
prohibition
of
our
*NL*
visits
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
grandmother
continued
to
send
him
fresh
changes
of
clothes
.
The
old
ones
*NL*
were
burned
up
.
The
last
night
we
saw
him
in
jail
his
mother
still
begged
*NL*
him
to
send
for
his
master
,
and
beg
his
pardon
.
Neither
persuasion
nor
*NL*
argument
could
turn
him
from
his
purpose
.
He
calmly
answered
,
``
I
am
waiting
*NL*
his
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Those
chains
were
mournful
to
hear
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
three
months
passed
,
and
Benjamin
left
his
prison
walls
.
We
that
*NL*
loved
him
waited
to
bid
him
a
long
and
last
farewell
.
A
slave
trader
had
*NL*
bought
him
.
You
remember
,
I
told
you
what
price
he
brought
when
ten
years
*NL*
of
age
.
Now
he
was
more
than
twenty
years
old
,
and
sold
for
three
hundred
*NL*
dollars
.
The
master
had
been
blind
to
his
own
interest
.
Long
confinement
*NL*
had
made
his
face
too
pale
,
his
form
too
thin
;
moreover
,
the
trader
had
*NL*
heard
something
of
his
character
,
and
it
did
not
strike
him
as
suitable
for
*NL*
a
slave
.
He
said
he
would
give
any
price
if
the
handsome
lad
was
a
girl
.
We
*NL*
thanked
God
that
he
was
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
Could
you
have
seen
that
mother
clinging
to
her
child
,
when
they
fastened
*NL*
the
irons
upon
his
wrists
;
could
you
have
heard
her
heart-rending
groans
,
*NL*
and
seen
her
bloodshot
eyes
wander
wildly
from
face
to
face
,
vainly
*NL*
pleading
for
mercy
;
could
you
have
witnessed
that
scene
as
I
saw
it
,
you
*NL*
would
exclaim
,
_
Slavery
is
damnable
_
!
Benjamin
,
her
youngest
,
her
pet
,
was
*NL*
forever
gone
!
She
could
not
realize
it
.
She
had
had
an
interview
with
the
*NL*
trader
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
if
Benjamin
could
be
purchased
.
She
*NL*
was
told
it
was
impossible
,
as
he
had
given
bonds
not
to
sell
him
till
he
*NL*
was
out
of
the
state
.
He
promised
that
he
would
not
sell
him
till
he
*NL*
reached
New
Orleans
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
strong
arm
and
unvaried
trust
,
my
grandmother
began
her
work
of
*NL*
love
.
Benjamin
must
be
free
.
If
she
succeeded
,
she
knew
they
would
still
be
*NL*
separated
;
but
the
sacrifice
was
not
too
great
.
Day
and
night
she
labored
.
*NL*
The
trader
's
price
would
treble
that
he
gave
;
but
she
was
not
discouraged
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
employed
a
lawyer
to
write
to
a
gentleman
,
whom
she
knew
,
in
New
*NL*
Orleans
.
She
begged
him
to
interest
himself
for
Benjamin
,
and
he
willingly
*NL*
favored
her
request
.
When
he
saw
Benjamin
,
and
stated
his
business
,
he
*NL*
thanked
him
;
but
said
he
preferred
to
wait
a
while
before
making
the
trader
*NL*
an
offer
.
He
knew
he
had
tried
to
obtain
a
high
price
for
him
,
and
had
*NL*
invariably
failed
.
This
encouraged
him
to
make
another
effort
for
freedom
.
*NL*
So
one
morning
,
long
before
day
,
Benjamin
was
missing
.
He
was
riding
over
*NL*
the
blue
billows
,
bound
for
Baltimore
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
once
his
white
face
did
him
a
kindly
service
.
They
had
no
suspicion
*NL*
that
it
belonged
to
a
slave
;
otherwise
,
the
law
would
have
been
followed
*NL*
out
to
the
letter
,
and
the
_
thing
_
rendered
back
to
slavery
.
The
brightest
*NL*
skies
are
often
overshadowed
by
the
darkest
clouds
.
Benjamin
was
taken
*NL*
sick
,
and
compelled
to
remain
in
Baltimore
three
weeks
.
His
strength
was
*NL*
slow
in
returning
;
and
his
desire
to
continue
his
journey
seemed
to
retard
*NL*
his
recovery
.
How
could
he
get
strength
without
air
and
exercise
?
He
*NL*
resolved
to
venture
on
a
short
walk
.
A
by-street
was
selected
,
where
he
*NL*
thought
himself
secure
of
not
being
met
by
any
one
that
knew
him
;
but
a
*NL*
voice
called
out
,
``
Halloo
,
Ben
,
my
boy
!
what
are
you
doing
_
here
_
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
first
impulse
was
to
run
;
but
his
legs
trembled
so
that
he
could
not
*NL*
stir
.
He
turned
to
confront
his
antagonist
,
and
behold
,
there
stood
his
old
*NL*
master
's
next
door
neighbor
!
He
thought
it
was
all
over
with
him
now
;
but
*NL*
it
proved
otherwise
.
That
man
was
a
miracle
.
He
possessed
a
goodly
number
*NL*
of
slaves
,
and
yet
was
not
quite
deaf
to
that
mystic
clock
,
whose
ticking
*NL*
is
rarely
heard
in
the
slaveholder
's
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ben
,
you
are
sick
,
''
said
he
.
``
Why
,
you
look
like
a
ghost
.
I
guess
I
gave
*NL*
you
something
of
a
start
.
Never
mind
,
Ben
,
I
am
not
going
to
touch
you
.
You
*NL*
had
a
pretty
tough
time
of
it
,
and
you
may
go
on
your
way
rejoicing
for
all
*NL*
me
.
But
I
would
advise
you
to
get
out
of
this
place
plaguy
quick
,
for
there
*NL*
are
several
gentlemen
here
from
our
town
.
''
He
described
the
nearest
and
*NL*
safest
route
to
New
York
,
and
added
,
``
I
shall
be
glad
to
tell
your
mother
I
*NL*
have
seen
you
.
Good
by
,
Ben
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Benjamin
turned
away
,
filled
with
gratitude
,
and
surprised
that
the
town
he
*NL*
hated
contained
such
a
gem
--
a
gem
worthy
of
a
purer
setting
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
gentleman
was
a
Northerner
by
birth
,
and
had
married
a
southern
lady
.
*NL*
On
his
return
,
he
told
my
grandmother
that
he
had
seen
her
son
,
and
of
the
*NL*
service
he
had
rendered
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Benjamin
reached
New
York
safely
,
and
concluded
to
stop
there
until
he
had
*NL*
gained
strength
enough
to
proceed
further
.
It
happened
that
my
*NL*
grandmother
's
only
remaining
son
had
sailed
for
the
same
city
on
business
*NL*
for
his
mistress
.
Through
God
's
providence
,
the
brothers
met
.
You
may
be
*NL*
sure
it
was
a
happy
meeting
.
``
O
Phil
,
''
exclaimed
Benjamin
,
``
I
am
here
at
*NL*
last
.
''
Then
he
told
him
how
near
he
came
to
dying
,
almost
in
sight
of
free
*NL*
land
,
and
how
he
prayed
that
he
might
live
to
get
one
breath
of
free
air
.
*NL*
He
said
life
was
worth
something
now
,
and
it
would
be
hard
to
die
.
In
the
*NL*
old
jail
he
had
not
valued
it
;
once
,
he
was
tempted
to
destroy
it
;
but
*NL*
something
,
he
did
not
know
what
,
had
prevented
him
;
perhaps
it
was
fear
.
He
*NL*
had
heard
those
who
profess
to
be
religious
declare
there
was
no
heaven
for
*NL*
self-murderers
;
and
as
his
life
had
been
pretty
hot
here
,
he
did
not
desire
*NL*
a
continuation
of
the
same
in
another
world
.
``
If
I
die
now
,
''
he
exclaimed
,
*NL*
``
thank
God
,
I
shall
die
a
freeman
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
begged
my
uncle
Phillip
not
to
return
south
;
but
stay
and
work
with
him
,
*NL*
till
they
earned
enough
to
buy
those
at
home
.
His
brother
told
him
it
would
*NL*
kill
their
mother
if
he
deserted
her
in
her
trouble
.
She
had
pledged
her
*NL*
house
,
and
with
difficulty
had
raised
money
to
buy
him
.
Would
he
be
bought
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
never
!
''
he
replied
.
``
Do
you
suppose
,
Phil
,
when
I
have
got
so
far
out
*NL*
of
their
clutches
,
I
will
give
them
one
red
cent
?
No
!
And
do
you
suppose
I
*NL*
would
turn
mother
out
of
her
home
in
her
old
age
?
That
I
would
let
her
pay
*NL*
all
those
hard-earned
dollars
for
me
,
and
never
to
see
me
?
For
you
know
she
*NL*
will
stay
south
as
long
as
her
other
children
are
slaves
.
What
a
good
*NL*
mother
!
Tell
her
to
buy
_
you
_
,
Phil
.
You
have
been
a
comfort
to
her
,
and
I
*NL*
have
been
a
trouble
.
And
Linda
,
poor
Linda
;
what
'll
become
of
her
?
Phil
,
*NL*
you
do
n't
know
what
a
life
they
lead
her
.
She
has
told
me
something
about
*NL*
it
,
and
I
wish
old
Flint
was
dead
,
or
a
better
man
.
When
I
was
in
jail
,
he
*NL*
asked
her
if
she
did
n't
want
_
him
_
to
ask
my
master
to
forgive
me
,
and
take
*NL*
me
home
again
.
She
told
him
,
No
;
that
I
did
n't
want
to
go
back
.
He
got
mad
,
*NL*
and
said
we
were
all
alike
.
I
never
despised
my
own
master
half
as
much
as
*NL*
I
do
that
man
.
There
is
many
a
worse
slaveholder
than
my
master
;
but
for
*NL*
all
that
I
would
not
be
his
slave
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
Benjamin
was
sick
,
he
had
parted
with
nearly
all
his
clothes
to
pay
*NL*
necessary
expenses
.
But
he
did
not
part
with
a
little
pin
I
fastened
in
his
*NL*
bosom
when
we
parted
.
It
was
the
most
valuable
thing
I
owned
,
and
I
thought
*NL*
none
more
worthy
to
wear
it
.
He
had
it
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
brother
furnished
him
with
clothes
,
and
gave
him
what
money
he
had
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
parted
with
moistened
eyes
;
and
as
Benjamin
turned
away
,
he
said
,
*NL*
``
Phil
,
I
part
with
all
my
kindred
.
''
And
so
it
proved
.
We
never
heard
from
*NL*
him
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Uncle
Phillip
came
home
;
and
the
first
words
he
uttered
when
he
entered
the
*NL*
house
were
,
``
Mother
,
Ben
is
free
!
I
have
seen
him
in
New
York
.
''
She
stood
*NL*
looking
at
him
with
a
bewildered
air
.
``
Mother
,
do
n't
you
believe
it
?
''
he
*NL*
said
,
laying
his
hand
softly
upon
her
shoulder
.
She
raised
her
hands
,
and
*NL*
exclaimed
,
``
God
be
praised
!
Let
us
thank
him
.
''
She
dropped
on
her
knees
,
*NL*
and
poured
forth
her
heart
in
prayer
.
Then
Phillip
must
sit
down
and
repeat
*NL*
to
her
every
word
Benjamin
had
said
.
He
told
her
all
;
only
he
forbore
to
*NL*
mention
how
sick
and
pale
her
darling
looked
.
Why
should
he
distress
her
*NL*
when
she
could
do
him
no
good
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
brave
old
woman
still
toiled
on
,
hoping
to
rescue
some
of
her
other
*NL*
children
.
After
a
while
she
succeeded
in
buying
Phillip
.
She
paid
eight
*NL*
hundred
dollars
,
and
came
home
with
the
precious
document
that
secured
his
*NL*
freedom
.
The
happy
mother
and
son
sat
together
by
the
old
hearthstone
that
*NL*
night
,
telling
how
proud
they
were
of
each
other
,
and
how
they
would
prove
*NL*
to
the
world
that
they
could
take
care
of
themselves
,
as
they
had
long
*NL*
taken
care
of
others
.
We
all
concluded
by
saying
,
``
He
that
is
_
willing
_
to
*NL*
be
a
slave
,
let
him
be
a
slave
.

The
Trials
Of
Girlhood
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
first
years
of
my
service
in
Dr.
Flint
's
family
,
I
was
*NL*
accustomed
to
share
some
indulgences
with
the
children
of
my
mistress
.
*NL*
Though
this
seemed
to
me
no
more
than
right
,
I
was
grateful
for
it
,
and
*NL*
tried
to
merit
the
kindness
by
the
faithful
discharge
of
my
duties
.
But
I
*NL*
now
entered
on
my
fifteenth
year
--
a
sad
epoch
in
the
life
of
a
slave
girl
.
*NL*
My
master
began
to
whisper
foul
words
in
my
ear
.
Young
as
I
was
,
I
could
*NL*
not
remain
ignorant
of
their
import
.
I
tried
to
treat
them
with
*NL*
indifference
or
contempt
.
The
master
's
age
,
my
extreme
youth
,
and
the
fear
*NL*
that
his
conduct
would
be
reported
to
my
grandmother
,
made
him
bear
this
*NL*
treatment
for
many
months
.
He
was
a
crafty
man
,
and
resorted
to
many
means
*NL*
to
accomplish
his
purposes
.
Sometimes
he
had
stormy
,
terrific
ways
,
that
*NL*
made
his
victims
tremble
;
sometimes
he
assumed
a
gentleness
that
he
thought
*NL*
must
surely
subdue
.
Of
the
two
,
I
preferred
his
stormy
moods
,
although
they
*NL*
left
me
trembling
.
He
tried
his
utmost
to
corrupt
the
pure
principles
my
*NL*
grandmother
had
instilled
.
He
peopled
my
young
mind
with
unclean
images
,
*NL*
such
as
only
a
vile
monster
could
think
of
.
I
turned
from
him
with
disgust
*NL*
and
hatred
.
But
he
was
my
master
.
I
was
compelled
to
live
under
the
same
*NL*
roof
with
him
--
where
I
saw
a
man
forty
years
my
senior
daily
violating
the
*NL*
most
sacred
commandments
of
nature
.
He
told
me
I
was
his
property
;
that
I
*NL*
must
be
subject
to
his
will
in
all
things
.
My
soul
revolted
against
the
*NL*
mean
tyranny
.
But
where
could
I
turn
for
protection
?
No
matter
whether
the
*NL*
slave
girl
be
as
black
as
ebony
or
as
fair
as
her
mistress
.
In
either
case
,
*NL*
there
is
no
shadow
of
law
to
protect
her
from
insult
,
from
violence
,
or
*NL*
even
from
death
;
all
these
are
inflicted
by
fiends
who
bear
the
shape
of
*NL*
men
.
The
mistress
,
who
ought
to
protect
the
helpless
victim
,
has
no
other
*NL*
feelings
towards
her
but
those
of
jealousy
and
rage
.
The
degradation
,
the
*NL*
wrongs
,
the
vices
,
that
grow
out
of
slavery
,
are
more
than
I
can
describe
.
*NL*
They
are
greater
than
you
would
willingly
believe
.
Surely
,
if
you
credited
*NL*
one
half
the
truths
that
are
told
you
concerning
the
helpless
millions
*NL*
suffering
in
this
cruel
bondage
,
you
at
the
north
would
not
help
to
tighten
*NL*
the
yoke
.
You
surely
would
refuse
to
do
for
the
master
,
on
your
own
soil
,
*NL*
the
mean
and
cruel
work
which
trained
bloodhounds
and
the
lowest
class
of
*NL*
whites
do
for
him
at
the
south
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
where
the
years
bring
to
all
enough
of
sin
and
sorrow
;
but
in
slavery
*NL*
the
very
dawn
of
life
is
darkened
by
these
shadows
.
Even
the
little
child
,
*NL*
who
is
accustomed
to
wait
on
her
mistress
and
her
children
,
will
learn
,
*NL*
before
she
is
twelve
years
old
,
why
it
is
that
her
mistress
hates
such
and
*NL*
such
a
one
among
the
slaves
.
Perhaps
the
child
's
own
mother
is
among
those
*NL*
hated
ones
.
She
listens
to
violent
outbreaks
of
jealous
passion
,
and
can
not
*NL*
help
understanding
what
is
the
cause
.
She
will
become
prematurely
knowing
*NL*
in
evil
things
.
Soon
she
will
learn
to
tremble
when
she
hears
her
master
's
*NL*
footfall
.
She
will
be
compelled
to
realize
that
she
is
no
longer
a
child
.
*NL*
If
God
has
bestowed
beauty
upon
her
,
it
will
prove
her
greatest
curse
.
That
*NL*
which
commands
admiration
in
the
white
woman
only
hastens
the
degradation
*NL*
of
the
female
slave
.
I
know
that
some
are
too
much
brutalized
by
slavery
to
*NL*
feel
the
humiliation
of
their
position
;
but
many
slaves
feel
it
most
*NL*
acutely
,
and
shrink
from
the
memory
of
it
.
I
can
not
tell
how
much
I
*NL*
suffered
in
the
presence
of
these
wrongs
,
nor
how
I
am
still
pained
by
the
*NL*
retrospect
.
My
master
met
me
at
every
turn
,
reminding
me
that
I
belonged
to
*NL*
him
,
and
swearing
by
heaven
and
earth
that
he
would
compel
me
to
submit
to
*NL*
him
.
If
I
went
out
for
a
breath
of
fresh
air
,
after
a
day
of
unwearied
*NL*
toil
,
his
footsteps
dogged
me
.
If
I
knelt
by
my
mother
's
grave
,
his
dark
*NL*
shadow
fell
on
me
even
there
.
The
light
heart
which
nature
had
given
me
*NL*
became
heavy
with
sad
forebodings
.
The
other
slaves
in
my
master
's
house
*NL*
noticed
the
change
.
Many
of
them
pitied
me
;
but
none
dared
to
ask
the
*NL*
cause
.
They
had
no
need
to
inquire
.
They
knew
too
well
the
guilty
practices
*NL*
under
that
roof
;
and
they
were
aware
that
to
speak
of
them
was
an
offence
*NL*
that
never
went
unpunished
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
longed
for
some
one
to
confide
in
.
I
would
have
given
the
world
to
have
*NL*
laid
my
head
on
my
grandmother
's
faithful
bosom
,
and
told
her
all
my
*NL*
troubles
.
But
Dr.
Flint
swore
he
would
kill
me
,
if
I
was
not
as
silent
as
*NL*
the
grave
.
Then
,
although
my
grandmother
was
all
in
all
to
me
,
I
feared
her
*NL*
as
well
as
loved
her
.
I
had
been
accustomed
to
look
up
to
her
with
a
*NL*
respect
bordering
upon
awe
.
I
was
very
young
,
and
felt
shamefaced
about
*NL*
telling
her
such
impure
things
,
especially
as
I
knew
her
to
be
very
strict
*NL*
on
such
subjects
.
Moreover
,
she
was
a
woman
of
a
high
spirit
.
She
was
*NL*
usually
very
quiet
in
her
demeanor
;
but
if
her
indignation
was
once
*NL*
roused
,
it
was
not
very
easily
quelled
.
I
had
been
told
that
she
once
*NL*
chased
a
white
gentleman
with
a
loaded
pistol
,
because
he
insulted
one
*NL*
of
her
daughters
.
I
dreaded
the
consequences
of
a
violent
outbreak
;
*NL*
and
both
pride
and
fear
kept
me
silent
.
But
though
I
did
not
confide
*NL*
in
my
grandmother
,
and
even
evaded
her
vigilant
watchfulness
and
inquiry
,
*NL*
her
presence
in
the
neighborhood
was
some
protection
to
me
.
Though
she
*NL*
had
been
a
slave
,
Dr.
Flint
was
afraid
of
her
.
He
dreaded
her
scorching
*NL*
rebukes
.
Moreover
,
she
was
known
and
patronized
by
many
people
;
and
he
*NL*
did
not
wish
to
have
his
villany
made
public
.
It
was
lucky
for
me
that
*NL*
I
did
not
live
on
a
distant
plantation
,
but
in
a
town
not
so
large
that
*NL*
the
inhabitants
were
ignorant
of
each
other
's
affairs
.
Bad
as
are
the
*NL*
laws
and
customs
in
a
slaveholding
community
,
the
doctor
,
as
a
*NL*
professional
man
,
deemed
it
prudent
to
keep
up
some
outward
show
of
*NL*
decency
.
*NL*
*NL*
O
,
what
days
and
nights
of
fear
and
sorrow
that
man
caused
me
!
Reader
,
it
*NL*
is
not
to
awaken
sympathy
for
myself
that
I
am
telling
you
truthfully
what
*NL*
I
suffered
in
slavery
.
I
do
it
to
kindle
a
flame
of
compassion
in
your
*NL*
hearts
for
my
sisters
who
are
still
in
bondage
,
suffering
as
I
once
*NL*
suffered
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
once
saw
two
beautiful
children
playing
together
.
One
was
a
fair
white
*NL*
child
;
the
other
was
her
slave
,
and
also
her
sister
.
When
I
saw
them
*NL*
embracing
each
other
,
and
heard
their
joyous
laughter
,
I
turned
sadly
away
*NL*
from
the
lovely
sight
.
I
foresaw
the
inevitable
blight
that
would
fall
on
*NL*
the
little
slave
's
heart
.
I
knew
how
soon
her
laughter
would
be
changed
to
*NL*
sighs
.
The
fair
child
grew
up
to
be
a
still
fairer
woman
.
From
childhood
to
*NL*
womanhood
her
pathway
was
blooming
with
flowers
,
and
overarched
by
a
sunny
*NL*
sky
.
Scarcely
one
day
of
her
life
had
been
clouded
when
the
sun
rose
on
her
*NL*
happy
bridal
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
had
those
years
dealt
with
her
slave
sister
,
the
little
playmate
of
her
*NL*
childhood
?
She
,
also
,
was
very
beautiful
;
but
the
flowers
and
sunshine
of
*NL*
love
were
not
for
her
.
She
drank
the
cup
of
sin
,
and
shame
,
and
misery
,
*NL*
whereof
her
persecuted
race
are
compelled
to
drink
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
view
of
these
things
,
why
are
ye
silent
,
ye
free
men
and
women
of
the
*NL*
north
?
Why
do
your
tongues
falter
in
maintenance
of
the
right
?
Would
that
I
*NL*
had
more
ability
!
But
my
heart
is
so
full
,
and
my
pen
is
so
weak
!
There
are
*NL*
noble
men
and
women
who
plead
for
us
,
striving
to
help
those
who
can
not
*NL*
help
themselves
.
God
bless
them
!
God
give
them
strength
and
courage
to
go
*NL*
on
!
God
bless
those
,
every
where
,
who
are
laboring
to
advance
the
cause
of
*NL*
humanity
!

The
Jealous
Mistress
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
would
ten
thousand
times
rather
that
my
children
should
be
the
*NL*
half-starved
paupers
of
Ireland
than
to
be
the
most
pampered
among
the
*NL*
slaves
of
America
.
I
would
rather
drudge
out
my
life
on
a
cotton
*NL*
plantation
,
till
the
grave
opened
to
give
me
rest
,
than
to
live
with
an
*NL*
unprincipled
master
and
a
jealous
mistress
.
The
felon
's
home
in
a
*NL*
penitentiary
is
preferable
.
He
may
repent
,
and
turn
from
the
error
of
his
*NL*
ways
,
and
so
find
peace
;
but
it
is
not
so
with
a
favorite
slave
.
She
is
not
*NL*
allowed
to
have
any
pride
of
character
.
It
is
deemed
a
crime
in
her
to
wish
*NL*
to
be
virtuous
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Flint
possessed
the
key
to
her
husband
's
character
before
I
was
born
.
*NL*
She
might
have
used
this
knowledge
to
counsel
and
to
screen
the
young
and
*NL*
the
innocent
among
her
slaves
;
but
for
them
she
had
no
sympathy
.
They
were
*NL*
the
objects
of
her
constant
suspicion
and
malevolence
.
She
watched
her
*NL*
husband
with
unceasing
vigilance
;
but
he
was
well
practised
in
means
to
*NL*
evade
it
.
What
he
could
not
find
opportunity
to
say
in
words
he
manifested
*NL*
in
signs
.
He
invented
more
than
were
ever
thought
of
in
a
deaf
and
dumb
*NL*
asylum
.
I
let
them
pass
,
as
if
I
did
not
understand
what
he
meant
;
and
many
*NL*
were
the
curses
and
threats
bestowed
on
me
for
my
stupidity
.
One
day
he
*NL*
caught
me
teaching
myself
to
write
.
He
frowned
,
as
if
he
was
not
well
*NL*
pleased
;
but
I
suppose
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
such
an
*NL*
accomplishment
might
help
to
advance
his
favorite
scheme
.
Before
long
,
*NL*
notes
were
often
slipped
into
my
hand
.
I
would
return
them
,
saying
,
``
I
*NL*
ca
n't
read
them
,
sir
.
''
``
Ca
n't
you
?
''
he
replied
;
``
then
I
must
read
them
to
*NL*
you
.
''
He
always
finished
the
reading
by
asking
,
``
Do
you
understand
?
''
*NL*
Sometimes
he
would
complain
of
the
heat
of
the
tea
room
,
and
order
his
*NL*
supper
to
be
placed
on
a
small
table
in
the
piazza
.
He
would
seat
himself
*NL*
there
with
a
well-satisfied
smile
,
and
tell
me
to
stand
by
and
brush
away
*NL*
the
flies
.
He
would
eat
very
slowly
,
pausing
between
the
mouthfuls
.
These
*NL*
intervals
were
employed
in
describing
the
happiness
I
was
so
foolishly
*NL*
throwing
away
,
and
in
threatening
me
with
the
penalty
that
finally
awaited
*NL*
my
stubborn
disobedience
.
He
boasted
much
of
the
forbearance
he
had
*NL*
exercised
towards
me
,
and
reminded
me
that
there
was
a
limit
to
his
*NL*
patience
.
When
I
succeeded
in
avoiding
opportunities
for
him
to
talk
to
me
*NL*
at
home
,
I
was
ordered
to
come
to
his
office
,
to
do
some
errand
.
When
*NL*
there
,
I
was
obliged
to
stand
and
listen
to
such
language
as
he
saw
fit
to
*NL*
address
to
me
.
Sometimes
I
so
openly
expressed
my
contempt
for
him
that
he
*NL*
would
become
violently
enraged
,
and
I
wondered
why
he
did
not
strike
me
.
*NL*
Circumstanced
as
he
was
,
he
probably
thought
it
was
better
policy
to
be
*NL*
forebearing
.
But
the
state
of
things
grew
worse
and
worse
daily
.
In
*NL*
desperation
I
told
him
that
I
must
and
would
apply
to
my
grandmother
for
*NL*
protection
.
He
threatened
me
with
death
,
and
worse
than
death
,
if
I
made
*NL*
any
complaint
to
her
.
Strange
to
say
,
I
did
not
despair
.
I
was
naturally
of
*NL*
a
buoyant
disposition
,
and
always
I
had
a
hope
of
somehow
getting
out
of
*NL*
his
clutches
.
Like
many
a
poor
,
simple
slave
before
me
,
I
trusted
that
some
*NL*
threads
of
joy
would
yet
be
woven
into
my
dark
destiny
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
entered
my
sixteenth
year
,
and
every
day
it
became
more
apparent
that
*NL*
my
presence
was
intolerable
to
Mrs.
Flint
.
Angry
words
frequently
passed
*NL*
between
her
and
her
husband
.
He
had
never
punished
me
himself
,
and
he
would
*NL*
not
allow
any
body
else
to
punish
me
.
In
that
respect
,
she
was
never
*NL*
satisfied
;
but
,
in
her
angry
moods
,
no
terms
were
too
vile
for
her
to
*NL*
bestow
upon
me
.
Yet
I
,
whom
she
detested
so
bitterly
,
had
far
more
pity
for
*NL*
her
than
he
had
,
whose
duty
it
was
to
make
her
life
happy
.
I
never
wronged
*NL*
her
,
or
wished
to
wrong
her
,
and
one
word
of
kindness
from
her
would
have
*NL*
brought
me
to
her
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
repeated
quarrels
between
the
doctor
and
his
wife
,
he
announced
his
*NL*
intention
to
take
his
youngest
daughter
,
then
four
years
old
,
to
sleep
in
*NL*
his
apartment
.
It
was
necessary
that
a
servant
should
sleep
in
the
same
*NL*
room
,
to
be
on
hand
if
the
child
stirred
.
I
was
selected
for
that
office
,
*NL*
and
informed
for
what
purpose
that
arrangement
had
been
made
.
By
managing
*NL*
to
keep
within
sight
of
people
,
as
much
as
possible
,
during
the
day
time
,
I
*NL*
had
hitherto
succeeded
in
eluding
my
master
,
though
a
razor
was
often
held
*NL*
to
my
throat
to
force
me
to
change
this
line
of
policy
.
At
night
I
slept
by
*NL*
the
side
of
my
great
aunt
,
where
I
felt
safe
.
He
was
too
prudent
to
come
*NL*
into
her
room
.
She
was
an
old
woman
,
and
had
been
in
the
family
many
years
.
*NL*
Moreover
,
as
a
married
man
,
and
a
professional
man
,
he
deemed
it
necessary
*NL*
to
save
appearances
in
some
degree
.
But
he
resolved
to
remove
the
obstacle
*NL*
in
the
way
of
his
scheme
;
and
he
thought
he
had
planned
it
so
that
he
*NL*
should
evade
suspicion
.
He
was
well
aware
how
much
I
prized
my
refuge
by
*NL*
the
side
of
my
old
aunt
,
and
he
determined
to
dispossess
me
of
it
.
The
*NL*
first
night
the
doctor
had
the
little
child
in
his
room
alone
.
The
next
*NL*
morning
,
I
was
ordered
to
take
my
station
as
nurse
the
following
night
.
A
*NL*
kind
Providence
interposed
in
my
favor
.
During
the
day
Mrs.
Flint
heard
of
*NL*
this
new
arrangement
,
and
a
storm
followed
.
I
rejoiced
to
hear
it
rage
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
while
my
mistress
sent
for
me
to
come
to
her
room
.
Her
first
*NL*
question
was
,
``
Did
you
know
you
were
to
sleep
in
the
doctor
's
room
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
ma'am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
told
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
master
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
answer
truly
all
the
questions
I
ask
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
ma'am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
,
then
,
as
you
hope
to
be
forgiven
,
are
you
innocent
of
what
I
have
*NL*
accused
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
handed
me
a
Bible
,
and
said
,
``
Lay
your
hand
on
your
heart
,
kiss
this
*NL*
holy
book
,
and
swear
before
God
that
you
tell
me
the
truth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
the
oath
she
required
,
and
I
did
it
with
a
clear
conscience
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
taken
God
's
holy
word
to
testify
your
innocence
,
''
said
she
.
``
If
*NL*
you
have
deceived
me
,
beware
!
Now
take
this
stool
,
sit
down
,
look
me
*NL*
directly
in
the
face
,
and
tell
me
all
that
has
passed
between
your
master
*NL*
and
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
as
she
ordered
.
As
I
went
on
with
my
account
her
color
changed
*NL*
frequently
,
she
wept
,
and
sometimes
groaned
.
She
spoke
in
tones
so
sad
,
*NL*
that
I
was
touched
by
her
grief
.
The
tears
came
to
my
eyes
;
but
I
was
soon
*NL*
convinced
that
her
emotions
arose
from
anger
and
wounded
pride
.
She
felt
*NL*
that
her
marriage
vows
were
desecrated
,
her
dignity
insulted
;
but
she
had
*NL*
no
compassion
for
the
poor
victim
of
her
husband
's
perfidy
.
She
pitied
*NL*
herself
as
a
martyr
;
but
she
was
incapable
of
feeling
for
the
condition
of
*NL*
shame
and
misery
in
which
her
unfortunate
,
helpless
slave
was
placed
.
Yet
*NL*
perhaps
she
had
some
touch
of
feeling
for
me
;
for
when
the
conference
was
*NL*
ended
,
she
spoke
kindly
,
and
promised
to
protect
me
.
I
should
have
been
*NL*
much
comforted
by
this
assurance
if
I
could
have
had
confidence
in
it
;
but
*NL*
my
experiences
in
slavery
had
filled
me
with
distrust
.
She
was
not
a
very
*NL*
refined
woman
,
and
had
not
much
control
over
her
passions
.
I
was
an
object
*NL*
of
her
jealousy
,
and
,
consequently
,
of
her
hatred
;
and
I
knew
I
could
not
*NL*
expect
kindness
or
confidence
from
her
under
the
circumstances
in
which
I
*NL*
was
placed
.
I
could
not
blame
her
.
Slaveholders
'
wives
feel
as
other
women
*NL*
would
under
similar
circumstances
.
The
fire
of
her
temper
kindled
from
*NL*
small-sparks
,
and
now
the
flame
became
so
intense
that
the
doctor
was
*NL*
obliged
to
give
up
his
intended
arrangement
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
knew
I
had
ignited
the
torch
,
and
I
expected
to
suffer
for
it
afterwards
;
*NL*
but
I
felt
too
thankful
to
my
mistress
for
the
timely
aid
she
rendered
me
*NL*
to
care
much
about
that
.
She
now
took
me
to
sleep
in
a
room
adjoining
her
*NL*
own
.
There
I
was
an
object
of
her
especial
care
,
though
not
to
her
especial
*NL*
comfort
,
for
she
spent
many
a
sleepless
night
to
watch
over
me
.
Sometimes
I
*NL*
woke
up
,
and
found
her
bending
over
me
.
At
other
times
she
whispered
in
my
*NL*
ear
,
as
though
it
was
her
husband
who
was
speaking
to
me
,
and
listened
to
*NL*
hear
what
I
would
answer
.
If
she
startled
me
,
on
such
occasions
,
she
would
*NL*
glide
stealthily
away
;
and
the
next
morning
she
would
tell
me
I
had
been
*NL*
talking
in
my
sleep
,
and
ask
who
I
was
talking
to
.
At
last
,
I
began
to
be
*NL*
fearful
for
my
life
.
It
had
been
often
threatened
;
and
you
can
imagine
,
*NL*
better
than
I
can
describe
,
what
an
unpleasant
sensation
it
must
produce
to
*NL*
wake
up
in
the
dead
of
night
and
find
a
jealous
woman
bending
over
you
.
*NL*
Terrible
as
this
experience
was
,
I
had
fears
that
it
would
give
place
to
*NL*
one
more
terrible
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
mistress
grew
weary
of
her
vigils
;
they
did
not
prove
satisfactory
.
She
*NL*
changed
her
tactics
.
She
now
tried
the
trick
of
accusing
my
master
of
*NL*
crime
,
in
my
presence
,
and
gave
my
name
as
the
author
of
the
accusation
.
To
*NL*
my
utter
astonishment
,
he
replied
,
``
I
do
n't
believe
it
;
but
if
she
did
*NL*
acknowledge
it
,
you
tortured
her
into
exposing
me
.
''
Tortured
into
exposing
*NL*
him
!
Truly
,
Satan
had
no
difficulty
in
distinguishing
the
color
of
his
*NL*
soul
!
I
understood
his
object
in
making
this
false
representation
.
It
was
*NL*
to
show
me
that
I
gained
nothing
by
seeking
the
protection
of
my
mistress
;
*NL*
that
the
power
was
still
all
in
his
own
hands
.
I
pitied
Mrs.
Flint
.
She
was
*NL*
a
second
wife
,
many
years
the
junior
of
her
husband
;
and
the
hoary-headed
*NL*
miscreant
was
enough
to
try
the
patience
of
a
wiser
and
better
woman
.
She
*NL*
was
completely
foiled
,
and
knew
not
how
to
proceed
.
She
would
gladly
have
*NL*
had
me
flogged
for
my
supposed
false
oath
;
but
,
as
I
have
already
stated
,
*NL*
the
doctor
never
allowed
any
one
to
whip
me
.
The
old
sinner
was
politic
.
*NL*
The
application
of
the
lash
might
have
led
to
remarks
that
would
have
*NL*
exposed
him
in
the
eyes
of
his
children
and
grandchildren
.
How
often
did
I
*NL*
rejoice
that
I
lived
in
a
town
where
all
the
inhabitants
knew
each
other
!
*NL*
If
I
had
been
on
a
remote
plantation
,
or
lost
among
the
multitude
of
a
*NL*
crowded
city
,
I
should
not
be
a
living
woman
at
this
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
secrets
of
slavery
are
concealed
like
those
of
the
Inquisition
.
My
*NL*
master
was
,
to
my
knowledge
,
the
father
of
eleven
slaves
.
But
did
the
*NL*
mothers
dare
to
tell
who
was
the
father
of
their
children
?
Did
the
other
*NL*
slaves
dare
to
allude
to
it
,
except
in
whispers
among
themselves
?
No
,
*NL*
indeed
!
They
knew
too
well
the
terrible
consequences
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
grandmother
could
not
avoid
seeing
things
which
excited
her
suspicions
.
*NL*
She
was
uneasy
about
me
,
and
tried
various
ways
to
buy
me
;
but
the
*NL*
never-changing
answer
was
always
repeated
:
``
Linda
does
not
belong
to
_
me
_
.
*NL*
She
is
my
daughter
's
property
,
and
I
have
no
legal
right
to
sell
her
.
''
The
*NL*
conscientious
man
!
He
was
too
scrupulous
to
_
sell
_
me
;
but
he
had
no
*NL*
scruples
whatever
about
committing
a
much
greater
wrong
against
the
*NL*
helpless
young
girl
placed
under
his
guardianship
,
as
his
daughter
's
*NL*
property
.
Sometimes
my
persecutor
would
ask
me
whether
I
would
like
to
be
*NL*
sold
.
I
told
him
I
would
rather
be
sold
to
any
body
than
to
lead
such
a
*NL*
life
as
I
did
.
On
such
occasions
he
would
assume
the
air
of
a
very
injured
*NL*
individual
,
and
reproach
me
for
my
ingratitude
.
``
Did
I
not
take
you
into
*NL*
the
house
,
and
make
you
the
companion
of
my
own
children
?
''
he
would
say
.
*NL*
``
Have
_
I
_
ever
treated
you
like
a
negro
?
I
have
never
allowed
you
to
be
*NL*
punished
,
not
even
to
please
your
mistress
.
And
this
is
the
recompense
I
*NL*
get
,
you
ungrateful
girl
!
''
I
answered
that
he
had
reasons
of
his
own
for
*NL*
screening
me
from
punishment
,
and
that
the
course
he
pursued
made
my
*NL*
mistress
hate
me
and
persecute
me
.
If
I
wept
,
he
would
say
,
``
Poor
child
!
*NL*
Do
n't
cry
!
do
n't
cry
!
I
will
make
peace
for
you
with
your
mistress
.
Only
*NL*
let
me
arrange
matters
in
my
own
way
.
Poor
,
foolish
girl
!
you
do
n't
know
*NL*
what
is
for
your
own
good
.
I
would
cherish
you
.
I
would
make
a
lady
of
you
.
*NL*
Now
go
,
and
think
of
all
I
have
promised
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
think
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Reader
,
I
draw
no
imaginary
pictures
of
southern
homes
.
I
am
telling
you
*NL*
the
plain
truth
.
Yet
when
victims
make
their
escape
from
the
wild
beast
of
*NL*
Slavery
,
northerners
consent
to
act
the
part
of
bloodhounds
,
and
hunt
the
*NL*
poor
fugitive
back
into
his
den
,
``
full
of
dead
men
's
bones
,
and
all
*NL*
uncleanness
.
''
Nay
,
more
,
they
are
not
only
willing
,
but
proud
,
to
give
*NL*
their
daughters
in
marriage
to
slaveholders
.
The
poor
girls
have
romantic
*NL*
notions
of
a
sunny
clime
,
and
of
the
flowering
vines
that
all
the
year
*NL*
round
shade
a
happy
home
.
To
what
disappointments
are
they
destined
!
The
*NL*
young
wife
soon
learns
that
the
husband
in
whose
hands
she
has
placed
her
*NL*
happiness
pays
no
regard
to
his
marriage
vows
.
Children
of
every
shade
of
*NL*
complexion
play
with
her
own
fair
babies
,
and
too
well
she
knows
that
they
*NL*
are
born
unto
him
of
his
own
household
.
Jealousy
and
hatred
enter
the
*NL*
flowery
home
,
and
it
is
ravaged
of
its
loveliness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Southern
women
often
marry
a
man
knowing
that
he
is
the
father
of
many
*NL*
little
slaves
.
They
do
not
trouble
themselves
about
it
.
They
regard
such
*NL*
children
as
property
,
as
marketable
as
the
pigs
on
the
plantation
;
and
it
*NL*
is
seldom
that
they
do
not
make
them
aware
of
this
by
passing
them
into
the
*NL*
slave-trader
's
hands
as
soon
as
possible
,
and
thus
getting
them
out
of
*NL*
their
sight
.
I
am
glad
to
say
there
are
some
honorable
exceptions
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
myself
known
two
southern
wives
who
exhorted
their
husbands
to
free
*NL*
those
slaves
towards
whom
they
stood
in
a
``
parental
relation
;
''
and
their
*NL*
request
was
granted
.
These
husbands
blushed
before
the
superior
nobleness
*NL*
of
their
wives
'
natures
.
Though
they
had
only
counselled
them
to
do
that
*NL*
which
it
was
their
duty
to
do
,
it
commanded
their
respect
,
and
rendered
*NL*
their
conduct
more
exemplary
.
Concealment
was
at
an
end
,
and
confidence
*NL*
took
the
place
of
distrust
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
this
bad
institution
deadens
the
moral
sense
,
even
in
white
women
,
*NL*
to
a
fearful
extent
,
it
is
not
altogether
extinct
.
I
have
heard
southern
*NL*
ladies
say
of
Mr.
Such
a
one
,
``
He
not
only
thinks
it
no
disgrace
to
be
the
*NL*
father
of
those
little
niggers
,
but
he
is
not
ashamed
to
call
himself
their
*NL*
master
.
I
declare
,
such
things
ought
not
to
be
tolerated
in
any
decent
*NL*
society
!

VII
.
The
Lover
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Why
does
the
slave
ever
love
?
Why
allow
the
tendrils
of
the
heart
to
twine
*NL*
around
objects
which
may
at
any
moment
be
wrenched
away
by
the
hand
of
*NL*
violence
?
When
separations
come
by
the
hand
of
death
,
the
pious
soul
can
*NL*
bow
in
resignation
,
and
say
,
``
Not
my
will
,
but
thine
be
done
,
O
Lord
!
''
But
*NL*
when
the
ruthless
hand
of
man
strikes
the
blow
,
regardless
of
the
misery
he
*NL*
causes
,
it
is
hard
to
be
submissive
.
I
did
not
reason
thus
when
I
was
a
*NL*
young
girl
.
Youth
will
be
youth
.
I
loved
and
I
indulged
the
hope
that
the
*NL*
dark
clouds
around
me
would
turn
out
a
bright
lining
.
I
forgot
that
in
the
*NL*
land
of
my
birth
the
shadows
are
too
dense
for
light
to
penetrate
.
A
land
*NL*
*NL*
Where
laughter
is
not
mirth
;
nor
thought
the
mind
;
*NL*
Nor
words
a
language
;
nor
e
`
en
men
mankind
.
*NL*
Where
cries
reply
to
curses
,
shrieks
to
blows
,
*NL*
And
each
is
tortured
in
his
separate
hell
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
in
the
neighborhood
a
young
colored
carpenter
;
a
free
born
man
.
*NL*
We
had
been
well
acquainted
in
childhood
,
and
frequently
met
together
*NL*
afterwards
.
We
became
mutually
attached
,
and
he
proposed
to
marry
me
.
I
*NL*
loved
him
with
all
the
ardor
of
a
young
girl
's
first
love
.
But
when
I
*NL*
reflected
that
I
was
a
slave
,
and
that
the
laws
gave
no
sanction
to
the
*NL*
marriage
of
such
,
my
heart
sank
within
me
.
My
lover
wanted
to
buy
me
;
but
I
*NL*
knew
that
Dr.
Flint
was
too
willful
and
arbitrary
a
man
to
consent
to
that
*NL*
arrangement
.
From
him
,
I
was
sure
of
experiencing
all
sort
of
opposition
,
*NL*
and
I
had
nothing
to
hope
from
my
mistress
.
She
would
have
been
delighted
*NL*
to
have
got
rid
of
me
,
but
not
in
that
way
.
It
would
have
relieved
her
mind
*NL*
of
a
burden
if
she
could
have
seen
me
sold
to
some
distant
state
,
but
if
I
*NL*
was
married
near
home
I
should
be
just
as
much
in
her
husband
's
power
as
I
*NL*
had
previously
been
,
--
for
the
husband
of
a
slave
has
no
power
to
protect
*NL*
her
.
Moreover
,
my
mistress
,
like
many
others
,
seemed
to
think
that
slaves
*NL*
had
no
right
to
any
family
ties
of
their
own
;
that
they
were
created
merely
*NL*
to
wait
upon
the
family
of
the
mistress
.
I
once
heard
her
abuse
a
young
*NL*
slave
girl
,
who
told
her
that
a
colored
man
wanted
to
make
her
his
wife
.
``
I
*NL*
will
have
you
peeled
and
pickled
,
my
lady
,
''
said
she
,
``
if
I
ever
hear
you
*NL*
mention
that
subject
again
.
Do
you
suppose
that
I
will
have
you
tending
*NL*
_
my
_
children
with
the
children
of
that
nigger
?
''
The
girl
to
whom
she
said
*NL*
this
had
a
mulatto
child
,
of
course
not
acknowledged
by
its
father
.
The
*NL*
poor
black
man
who
loved
her
would
have
been
proud
to
acknowledge
his
*NL*
helpless
offspring
.
*NL*
*NL*
Many
and
anxious
were
the
thoughts
I
revolved
in
my
mind
.
I
was
at
a
loss
*NL*
what
to
do
.
Above
all
things
,
I
was
desirous
to
spare
my
lover
the
insults
*NL*
that
had
cut
so
deeply
into
my
own
soul
.
I
talked
with
my
grandmother
about
*NL*
it
,
and
partly
told
her
my
fears
.
I
did
not
dare
to
tell
her
the
worst
.
She
*NL*
had
long
suspected
all
was
not
right
,
and
if
I
confirmed
her
suspicions
I
*NL*
knew
a
storm
would
rise
that
would
prove
the
overthrow
of
all
my
hopes
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
love-dream
had
been
my
support
through
many
trials
;
and
I
could
not
*NL*
bear
to
run
the
risk
of
having
it
suddenly
dissipated
.
There
was
a
lady
in
*NL*
the
neighborhood
,
a
particular
friend
of
Dr.
Flint
's
,
who
often
visited
the
*NL*
house
.
I
had
a
great
respect
for
her
,
and
she
had
always
manifested
a
*NL*
friendly
interest
in
me
.
Grandmother
thought
she
would
have
great
influence
*NL*
with
the
doctor
.
I
went
to
this
lady
,
and
told
her
my
story
.
I
told
her
I
*NL*
was
aware
that
my
lover
's
being
a
free-born
man
would
prove
a
great
*NL*
objection
;
but
he
wanted
to
buy
me
;
and
if
Dr.
Flint
would
consent
to
that
*NL*
arrangement
,
I
felt
sure
he
would
be
willing
to
pay
any
reasonable
price
.
*NL*
She
knew
that
Mrs.
Flint
disliked
me
;
therefore
,
I
ventured
to
suggest
that
*NL*
perhaps
my
mistress
would
approve
of
my
being
sold
,
as
that
would
rid
her
*NL*
of
me
.
The
lady
listened
with
kindly
sympathy
,
and
promised
to
do
her
*NL*
utmost
to
promote
my
wishes
.
She
had
an
interview
with
the
doctor
,
and
I
*NL*
believe
she
pleaded
my
cause
earnestly
;
but
it
was
all
to
no
purpose
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
I
dreaded
my
master
now
!
Every
minute
I
expected
to
be
summoned
to
his
*NL*
presence
;
but
the
day
passed
,
and
I
heard
nothing
from
him
.
The
next
*NL*
morning
,
a
message
was
brought
to
me
:
``
Master
wants
you
in
his
study
.
''
I
*NL*
found
the
door
ajar
,
and
I
stood
a
moment
gazing
at
the
hateful
man
who
*NL*
claimed
a
right
to
rule
me
,
body
and
soul
.
I
entered
,
and
tried
to
appear
*NL*
calm
.
I
did
not
want
him
to
know
how
my
heart
was
bleeding
.
He
looked
*NL*
fixedly
at
me
,
with
an
expression
which
seemed
to
say
,
``
I
have
half
a
mind
*NL*
to
kill
you
on
the
spot
.
''
At
last
he
broke
the
silence
,
and
that
was
a
*NL*
relief
to
both
of
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
want
to
be
married
,
do
you
?
''
said
he
,
``
and
to
a
free
nigger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'll
soon
convince
you
whether
I
am
your
master
,
or
the
nigger
*NL*
fellow
you
honor
so
highly
.
If
you
_
must
_
have
a
husband
,
you
may
take
up
*NL*
with
one
of
my
slaves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
a
situation
I
should
be
in
,
as
the
wife
of
one
of
_
his
_
slaves
,
even
*NL*
if
my
heart
had
been
interested
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
replied
,
``
Do
n't
you
suppose
,
sir
,
that
a
slave
can
have
some
preference
*NL*
about
marrying
?
Do
you
suppose
that
all
men
are
alike
to
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
love
this
nigger
?
''
said
he
,
abruptly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
dare
you
tell
me
so
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
in
great
wrath
.
After
a
slight
*NL*
pause
,
he
added
,
``
I
supposed
you
thought
more
of
yourself
;
that
you
felt
*NL*
above
the
insults
of
such
puppies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
replied
,
``
If
he
is
a
puppy
,
I
am
a
puppy
,
for
we
are
both
of
the
negro
*NL*
race
.
It
is
right
and
honorable
for
us
to
love
each
other
.
The
man
you
call
*NL*
a
puppy
never
insulted
me
,
sir
;
and
he
would
not
love
me
if
he
did
not
*NL*
believe
me
to
be
a
virtuous
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
sprang
upon
me
like
a
tiger
,
and
gave
me
a
stunning
blow
.
It
was
the
*NL*
first
time
he
had
ever
struck
me
;
and
fear
did
not
enable
me
to
control
my
*NL*
anger
.
When
I
had
recovered
a
little
from
the
effects
,
I
exclaimed
,
``
You
*NL*
have
struck
me
for
answering
you
honestly
.
How
I
despise
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
silence
for
some
minutes
.
Perhaps
he
was
deciding
what
should
be
*NL*
my
punishment
;
or
,
perhaps
,
he
wanted
to
give
me
time
to
reflect
on
what
I
*NL*
had
said
,
and
to
whom
I
had
said
it
.
Finally
,
he
asked
,
``
Do
you
know
what
*NL*
you
have
said
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
;
but
your
treatment
drove
me
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
that
I
have
a
right
to
do
as
I
like
with
you
,
--
that
I
can
kill
*NL*
you
,
if
I
please
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
tried
to
kill
me
,
and
I
wish
you
had
;
but
you
have
no
right
to
do
*NL*
as
you
like
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Silence
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
in
a
thundering
voice
.
``
By
heavens
,
girl
,
you
*NL*
forget
yourself
too
far
!
Are
you
mad
?
If
you
are
,
I
will
soon
bring
you
to
*NL*
your
senses
.
Do
you
think
any
other
master
would
bear
what
I
have
borne
*NL*
from
you
this
morning
?
Many
masters
would
have
killed
you
on
the
spot
.
How
*NL*
would
you
like
to
be
sent
to
jail
for
your
insolence
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
I
have
been
disrespectful
,
sir
,
''
I
replied
;
``
but
you
drove
me
to
*NL*
it
;
I
could
n't
help
it
.
As
for
the
jail
,
there
would
be
more
peace
for
me
*NL*
there
than
there
is
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
deserve
to
go
there
,
''
said
he
,
``
and
to
be
under
such
treatment
,
that
*NL*
you
would
forget
the
meaning
of
the
word
_
peace
_
.
It
would
do
you
good
.
It
*NL*
would
take
some
of
your
high
notions
out
of
you
.
But
I
am
not
ready
to
send
*NL*
you
there
yet
,
notwithstanding
your
ingratitude
for
all
my
kindness
and
*NL*
forbearance
.
You
have
been
the
plague
of
my
life
.
I
have
wanted
to
make
you
*NL*
happy
,
and
I
have
been
repaid
with
the
basest
ingratitude
;
but
though
you
*NL*
have
proved
yourself
incapable
of
appreciating
my
kindness
,
I
will
be
*NL*
lenient
towards
you
,
Linda
.
I
will
give
you
one
more
chance
to
redeem
your
*NL*
character
.
If
you
behave
yourself
and
do
as
I
require
,
I
will
forgive
you
*NL*
and
treat
you
as
I
always
have
done
;
but
if
you
disobey
me
,
I
will
punish
*NL*
you
as
I
would
the
meanest
slave
on
my
plantation
.
Never
let
me
hear
that
*NL*
fellow
's
name
mentioned
again
.
If
I
ever
know
of
your
speaking
to
him
,
I
*NL*
will
cowhide
you
both
;
and
if
I
catch
him
lurking
about
my
premises
,
I
will
*NL*
shoot
him
as
soon
as
I
would
a
dog
.
Do
you
hear
what
I
say
?
I
'll
teach
you
*NL*
a
lesson
about
marriage
and
free
niggers
!
Now
go
,
and
let
this
be
the
last
*NL*
time
I
have
occasion
to
speak
to
you
on
this
subject
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Reader
,
did
you
ever
hate
?
I
hope
not
.
I
never
did
but
once
;
and
I
trust
I
*NL*
never
shall
again
.
Somebody
has
called
it
``
the
atmosphere
of
hell
;
''
and
I
*NL*
believe
it
is
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
fortnight
the
doctor
did
not
speak
to
me
.
He
thought
to
mortify
me
;
*NL*
to
make
me
feel
that
I
had
disgraced
myself
by
receiving
the
honorable
*NL*
addresses
of
a
respectable
colored
man
,
in
preference
to
the
base
proposals
*NL*
of
a
white
man
.
But
though
his
lips
disdained
to
address
me
,
his
eyes
were
*NL*
very
loquacious
.
No
animal
ever
watched
its
prey
more
narrowly
than
he
*NL*
watched
me
.
He
knew
that
I
could
write
,
though
he
had
failed
to
make
me
*NL*
read
his
letters
;
and
he
was
now
troubled
lest
I
should
exchange
letters
*NL*
with
another
man
.
After
a
while
he
became
weary
of
silence
;
and
I
was
sorry
*NL*
for
it
.
One
morning
,
as
he
passed
through
the
hall
,
to
leave
the
house
,
he
*NL*
contrived
to
thrust
a
note
into
my
hand
.
I
thought
I
had
better
read
it
,
*NL*
and
spare
myself
the
vexation
of
having
him
read
it
to
me
.
It
expressed
*NL*
regret
for
the
blow
he
had
given
me
,
and
reminded
me
that
I
myself
was
*NL*
wholly
to
blame
for
it
.
He
hoped
I
had
become
convinced
of
the
injury
I
was
*NL*
doing
myself
by
incurring
his
displeasure
.
He
wrote
that
he
had
made
up
his
*NL*
mind
to
go
to
Louisiana
;
that
he
should
take
several
slaves
with
him
,
and
*NL*
intended
I
should
be
one
of
the
number
.
My
mistress
would
remain
where
she
*NL*
was
;
therefore
I
should
have
nothing
to
fear
from
that
quarter
.
If
I
*NL*
merited
kindness
from
him
,
he
assured
me
that
it
would
be
lavishly
*NL*
bestowed
.
He
begged
me
to
think
over
the
matter
,
and
answer
the
following
*NL*
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
I
was
called
to
carry
a
pair
of
scissors
to
his
room
.
I
*NL*
laid
them
on
the
table
,
with
the
letter
beside
them
.
He
thought
it
was
my
*NL*
answer
,
and
did
not
call
me
back
.
I
went
as
usual
to
attend
my
young
*NL*
mistress
to
and
from
school
.
He
met
me
in
the
street
,
and
ordered
me
to
*NL*
stop
at
his
office
on
my
way
back
.
When
I
entered
,
he
showed
me
his
letter
,
*NL*
and
asked
me
why
I
had
not
answered
it
.
I
replied
,
``
I
am
your
daughter
's
*NL*
property
,
and
it
is
in
your
power
to
send
me
,
or
take
me
,
wherever
you
*NL*
please
.
''
He
said
he
was
very
glad
to
find
me
so
willing
to
go
,
and
that
we
*NL*
should
start
early
in
the
autumn
.
He
had
a
large
practice
in
the
town
,
and
*NL*
I
rather
thought
he
had
made
up
the
story
merely
to
frighten
me
.
However
*NL*
that
might
be
,
I
was
determined
that
I
would
never
go
to
Louisiana
with
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Summer
passed
away
,
and
early
in
the
autumn
Dr.
Flint
's
eldest
son
was
sent
*NL*
to
Louisiana
to
examine
the
country
,
with
a
view
to
emigrating
.
That
news
*NL*
did
not
disturb
me
.
I
knew
very
well
that
I
should
not
be
sent
with
_
him
_
.
*NL*
That
I
had
not
been
taken
to
the
plantation
before
this
time
,
was
owing
to
*NL*
the
fact
that
his
son
was
there
.
He
was
jealous
of
his
son
;
and
jealousy
of
*NL*
the
overseer
had
kept
him
from
punishing
me
by
sending
me
into
the
fields
*NL*
to
work
.
Is
it
strange
,
that
I
was
not
proud
of
these
protectors
?
As
for
*NL*
the
overseer
,
he
was
a
man
for
whom
I
had
less
respect
than
I
had
for
a
*NL*
bloodhound
.
*NL*
*NL*
Young
Mr.
Flint
did
not
bring
back
a
favorable
report
of
Louisiana
,
and
I
*NL*
heard
no
more
of
that
scheme
.
Soon
after
this
,
my
lover
met
me
at
the
*NL*
corner
of
the
street
,
and
I
stopped
to
speak
to
him
.
Looking
up
,
I
saw
my
*NL*
master
watching
us
from
his
window
.
I
hurried
home
,
trembling
with
fear
.
I
*NL*
was
sent
for
,
immediately
,
to
go
to
his
room
.
He
met
me
with
a
blow
.
``
When
*NL*
is
mistress
to
be
married
?
''
said
he
,
in
a
sneering
tone
.
A
shower
of
oaths
*NL*
and
imprecations
followed
.
How
thankful
I
was
that
my
lover
was
a
free
man
!
*NL*
that
my
tyrant
had
no
power
to
flog
him
for
speaking
to
me
in
the
street
!
*NL*
*NL*
Again
and
again
I
revolved
in
my
mind
how
all
this
would
end
.
There
was
no
*NL*
hope
that
the
doctor
would
consent
to
sell
me
on
any
terms
.
He
had
an
iron
*NL*
will
,
and
was
determined
to
keep
me
,
and
to
conquer
me
.
My
lover
was
an
*NL*
intelligent
and
religious
man
.
Even
if
he
could
have
obtained
permission
to
*NL*
marry
me
while
I
was
a
slave
,
the
marriage
would
give
him
no
power
to
*NL*
protect
me
from
my
master
.
It
would
have
made
him
miserable
to
witness
the
*NL*
insults
I
should
have
been
subjected
to
.
And
then
,
if
we
had
children
,
I
*NL*
knew
they
must
``
follow
the
condition
of
the
mother
.
''
What
a
terrible
blight
*NL*
that
would
be
on
the
heart
of
a
free
,
intelligent
father
!
For
_
his
_
sake
,
I
*NL*
felt
that
I
ought
not
to
link
his
fate
with
my
own
unhappy
destiny
.
He
was
*NL*
going
to
Savannah
to
see
about
a
little
property
left
him
by
an
uncle
;
and
*NL*
hard
as
it
was
to
bring
my
feelings
to
it
,
I
earnestly
entreated
him
not
to
*NL*
come
back
.
I
advised
him
to
go
to
the
Free
States
,
where
his
tongue
would
*NL*
not
be
tied
,
and
where
his
intelligence
would
be
of
more
avail
to
him
.
He
*NL*
left
me
,
still
hoping
the
day
would
come
when
I
could
be
bought
.
With
me
*NL*
the
lamp
of
hope
had
gone
out
.
The
dream
of
my
girlhood
was
over
.
I
felt
*NL*
lonely
and
desolate
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
I
was
not
stripped
of
all
.
I
still
had
my
good
grandmother
,
and
my
*NL*
affectionate
brother
.
When
he
put
his
arms
round
my
neck
,
and
looked
into
*NL*
my
eyes
,
as
if
to
read
there
the
troubles
I
dared
not
tell
,
I
felt
that
I
*NL*
still
had
something
to
love
.
But
even
that
pleasant
emotion
was
chilled
by
*NL*
the
reflection
that
he
might
be
torn
from
me
at
any
moment
,
by
some
sudden
*NL*
freak
of
my
master
.
If
he
had
known
how
we
loved
each
other
,
I
think
he
*NL*
would
have
exulted
in
separating
us
.
We
often
planned
together
how
we
could
*NL*
get
to
the
north
.
But
,
as
William
remarked
,
such
things
are
easier
said
*NL*
than
done
.
My
movements
were
very
closely
watched
,
and
we
had
no
means
of
*NL*
getting
any
money
to
defray
our
expenses
.
As
for
grandmother
,
she
was
*NL*
strongly
opposed
to
her
children
's
undertaking
any
such
project
.
She
had
*NL*
not
forgotten
poor
Benjamin
's
sufferings
,
and
she
was
afraid
that
if
*NL*
another
child
tried
to
escape
,
he
would
have
a
similar
or
a
worse
fate
.
To
*NL*
me
,
nothing
seemed
more
dreadful
than
my
present
life
.
I
said
to
myself
,
*NL*
``
William
_
must
_
be
free
.
He
shall
go
to
the
north
,
and
I
will
follow
him
.

Many
a

sister
has
formed
the

plans

What
Slaves
Are
Taught
To
Think
Of
The
North
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Slaveholders
pride
themselves
upon
being
honorable
men
;
but
if
you
were
to
*NL*
hear
the
enormous
lies
they
tell
their
slaves
,
you
would
have
small
respect
*NL*
for
their
veracity
.
I
have
spoken
plain
English
.
Pardon
me
.
I
can
not
use
a
*NL*
milder
term
.
When
they
visit
the
north
,
and
return
home
,
they
tell
their
*NL*
slaves
of
the
runaways
they
have
seen
,
and
describe
them
to
be
in
the
most
*NL*
deplorable
condition
.
A
slaveholder
once
told
me
that
he
had
seen
a
runaway
*NL*
friend
of
mine
in
New
York
,
and
that
she
besought
him
to
take
her
back
to
*NL*
her
master
,
for
she
was
literally
dying
of
starvation
;
that
many
days
she
*NL*
had
only
one
cold
potato
to
eat
,
and
at
other
times
could
get
nothing
at
*NL*
all
.
He
said
he
refused
to
take
her
,
because
he
knew
her
master
would
not
*NL*
thank
him
for
bringing
such
a
miserable
wretch
to
his
house
.
He
ended
by
*NL*
saying
to
me
,
``
This
is
the
punishment
she
brought
on
herself
for
running
*NL*
away
from
a
kind
master
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
whole
story
was
false
.
I
afterwards
staid
with
that
friend
in
New
*NL*
York
,
and
found
her
in
comfortable
circumstances
.
She
had
never
thought
of
*NL*
such
a
thing
as
wishing
to
go
back
to
slavery
.
Many
of
the
slaves
believe
*NL*
such
stories
,
and
think
it
is
not
worth
while
to
exchange
slavery
for
such
*NL*
a
hard
kind
of
freedom
.
It
is
difficult
to
persuade
such
that
freedom
could
*NL*
make
them
useful
men
,
and
enable
them
to
protect
their
wives
and
children
.
*NL*
If
those
heathen
in
our
Christian
land
had
as
much
teaching
as
some
*NL*
Hindoos
,
they
would
think
otherwise
.
They
would
know
that
liberty
is
more
*NL*
valuable
than
life
.
They
would
begin
to
understand
their
own
capabilities
,
*NL*
and
exert
themselves
to
become
men
and
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
while
the
Free
States
sustain
a
law
which
hurls
fugitives
back
into
*NL*
slavery
,
how
can
the
slaves
resolve
to
become
men
?
There
are
some
who
*NL*
strive
to
protect
wives
and
daughters
from
the
insults
of
their
masters
;
*NL*
but
those
who
have
such
sentiments
have
had
advantages
above
the
general
*NL*
mass
of
slaves
.
They
have
been
partially
civilized
and
Christianized
by
*NL*
favorable
circumstances
.
Some
are
bold
enough
to
_
utter
_
such
sentiments
to
*NL*
their
masters
.
O
,
that
there
were
more
of
them
!
*NL*
*NL*
Some
poor
creatures
have
been
so
brutalized
by
the
lash
that
they
will
*NL*
sneak
out
of
the
way
to
give
their
masters
free
access
to
their
wives
and
*NL*
daughters
.
Do
you
think
this
proves
the
black
man
to
belong
to
an
inferior
*NL*
order
of
beings
?
What
would
_
you
_
be
,
if
you
had
been
born
and
brought
up
a
*NL*
slave
,
with
generations
of
slaves
for
ancestors
?
I
admit
that
the
black
man
*NL*
_
is
_
inferior
.
But
what
is
it
that
makes
him
so
?
It
is
the
ignorance
in
*NL*
which
white
men
compel
him
to
live
;
it
is
the
torturing
whip
that
lashes
*NL*
manhood
out
of
him
;
it
is
the
fierce
bloodhounds
of
the
South
,
and
the
*NL*
scarcely
less
cruel
human
bloodhounds
of
the
north
,
who
enforce
the
*NL*
Fugitive
Slave
Law
.
_
They
_
do
the
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
Southern
gentlemen
indulge
in
the
most
contemptuous
expressions
about
the
*NL*
Yankees
,
while
they
,
on
their
part
,
consent
to
do
the
vilest
work
for
them
,
*NL*
such
as
the
ferocious
bloodhounds
and
the
despised
negro-hunters
are
*NL*
employed
to
do
at
home
.
When
southerners
go
to
the
north
,
they
are
proud
to
*NL*
do
them
honor
;
but
the
northern
man
is
not
welcome
south
of
Mason
and
*NL*
Dixon
's
line
,
unless
he
suppresses
every
thought
and
feeling
at
variance
*NL*
with
their
``
peculiar
institution
.
''
Nor
is
it
enough
to
be
silent
.
The
*NL*
masters
are
not
pleased
,
unless
they
obtain
a
greater
degree
of
*NL*
subservience
than
that
;
and
they
are
generally
accommodated
.
Do
they
*NL*
respect
the
northerner
for
this
?
I
trow
not
.
Even
the
slaves
despise
``
a
*NL*
northern
man
with
southern
principles
;
''
and
that
is
the
class
they
*NL*
generally
see
.
When
northerners
go
to
the
south
to
reside
,
they
prove
very
*NL*
apt
scholars
.
They
soon
imbibe
the
sentiments
and
disposition
of
their
*NL*
neighbors
,
and
generally
go
beyond
their
teachers
.
Of
the
two
,
they
are
*NL*
proverbially
the
hardest
masters
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
seem
to
satisfy
their
consciences
with
the
doctrine
that
God
created
*NL*
the
Africans
to
be
slaves
.
What
a
libel
upon
the
heavenly
Father
,
who
``
made
*NL*
of
one
blood
all
nations
of
men
!
''
And
then
who
_
are
_
Africans
?
Who
can
*NL*
measure
the
amount
of
Anglo-Saxon
blood
coursing
in
the
veins
of
American
*NL*
slaves
?
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
spoken
of
the
pains
slaveholders
take
to
give
their
slaves
a
bad
*NL*
opinion
of
the
north
;
but
,
notwithstanding
this
,
intelligent
slaves
are
*NL*
aware
that
they
have
many
friends
in
the
Free
States
.
Even
the
most
*NL*
ignorant
have
some
confused
notions
about
it
.
They
knew
that
I
could
read
;
*NL*
and
I
was
often
asked
if
I
had
seen
any
thing
in
the
newspapers
about
white
*NL*
folks
over
in
the
big
north
,
who
were
trying
to
get
their
freedom
for
them
.
*NL*
Some
believe
that
the
abolitionists
have
already
made
them
free
,
and
that
*NL*
it
is
established
by
law
,
but
that
their
masters
prevent
the
law
from
going
*NL*
into
effect
.
One
woman
begged
me
to
get
a
newspaper
and
read
it
over
.
She
*NL*
said
her
husband
told
her
that
the
black
people
had
sent
word
to
the
queen
*NL*
of
`
Merica
that
they
were
all
slaves
;
that
she
did
n't
believe
it
,
and
went
*NL*
to
Washington
city
to
see
the
president
about
it
.
They
quarrelled
;
she
drew
*NL*
her
sword
upon
him
,
and
swore
that
he
should
help
her
to
make
them
all
*NL*
free
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
poor
,
ignorant
woman
thought
that
America
was
governed
by
a
Queen
,
to
*NL*
whom
the
President
was
subordinate
.
I
wish
the
President
was
subordinate
to
*NL*
Queen
Justice
.

Sketches
Of
Neighboring
Slaveholders
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
planter
in
the
country
,
not
far
from
us
,
whom
I
will
call
Mr.
*NL*
Litch
.
He
was
an
ill-bred
,
uneducated
man
,
but
very
wealthy
.
He
had
six
*NL*
hundred
slaves
,
many
of
whom
he
did
not
know
by
sight
.
His
extensive
*NL*
plantation
was
managed
by
well-paid
overseers
.
There
was
a
jail
and
a
*NL*
whipping
post
on
his
grounds
;
and
whatever
cruelties
were
perpetrated
*NL*
there
,
they
passed
without
comment
.
He
was
so
effectually
screened
by
his
*NL*
great
wealth
that
he
was
called
to
no
account
for
his
crimes
,
not
even
for
*NL*
murder
.
*NL*
*NL*
Various
were
the
punishments
resorted
to
.
A
favorite
one
was
to
tie
a
rope
*NL*
round
a
man
's
body
,
and
suspend
him
from
the
ground
.
A
fire
was
kindled
*NL*
over
him
,
from
which
was
suspended
a
piece
of
fat
pork
.
As
this
cooked
,
the
*NL*
scalding
drops
of
fat
continually
fell
on
the
bare
flesh
.
On
his
own
*NL*
plantation
,
he
required
very
strict
obedience
to
the
eighth
commandment
.
*NL*
But
depredations
on
the
neighbors
were
allowable
,
provided
the
culprit
*NL*
managed
to
evade
detection
or
suspicion
.
If
a
neighbor
brought
a
charge
of
*NL*
theft
against
any
of
his
slaves
,
he
was
browbeaten
by
the
master
,
who
*NL*
assured
him
that
his
slaves
had
enough
of
every
thing
at
home
,
and
had
no
*NL*
inducement
to
steal
.
No
sooner
was
the
neighbor
's
back
turned
,
than
the
*NL*
accused
was
sought
out
,
and
whipped
for
his
lack
of
discretion
.
If
a
slave
*NL*
stole
from
him
even
a
pound
of
meat
or
a
peck
of
corn
,
if
detection
*NL*
followed
,
he
was
put
in
chains
and
imprisoned
,
and
so
kept
till
his
form
*NL*
was
attentuated
by
hunger
and
suffering
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
freshnet
once
bore
his
wine
cellar
and
meat
house
miles
away
from
the
*NL*
plantation
.
Some
slaves
followed
,
and
secured
bits
of
meat
and
bottles
of
*NL*
wine
.
Two
were
detected
;
a
ham
and
some
liquor
being
found
in
their
huts
.
*NL*
They
were
summoned
by
their
master
.
No
words
were
used
,
but
a
club
felled
*NL*
them
to
the
ground
.
A
rough
box
was
their
coffin
,
and
their
interment
was
a
*NL*
dog
's
burial
.
Nothing
was
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Murder
was
so
common
on
his
plantation
that
he
feared
to
be
alone
after
*NL*
nightfall
.
He
might
have
believed
in
ghosts
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
brother
,
if
not
equal
in
wealth
,
was
at
least
equal
in
cruelty
.
His
*NL*
bloodhounds
were
well
trained
.
Their
pen
was
spacious
,
and
a
terror
to
the
*NL*
slaves
.
They
were
let
loose
on
a
runway
,
and
,
if
they
tracked
him
,
they
*NL*
literally
tore
the
flesh
from
his
bones
.
When
this
slaveholder
died
,
his
*NL*
shrieks
and
groans
were
so
frightful
that
they
appalled
his
own
friends
.
*NL*
His
last
words
were
,
``
I
am
going
to
hell
;
bury
my
money
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
death
his
eyes
remained
open
.
To
press
the
lids
down
,
silver
dollars
*NL*
were
laid
on
them
.
These
were
buried
with
him
.
From
this
circumstance
,
a
*NL*
rumor
went
abroad
that
his
coffin
was
filled
with
money
.
Three
times
his
*NL*
grave
was
opened
,
and
his
coffin
taken
out
.
The
last
time
,
his
body
was
*NL*
found
on
the
ground
,
and
a
flock
of
buzzards
were
pecking
at
it
.
He
was
*NL*
again
interred
,
and
a
sentinel
set
over
his
grave
.
The
perpetrators
were
*NL*
never
discovered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cruelty
is
contagious
in
uncivilized
communities
.
Mr.
Conant
,
a
neighbor
of
*NL*
Mr.
Litch
,
returned
from
town
one
evening
in
a
partial
state
of
*NL*
intoxication
.
His
body
servant
gave
him
some
offence
.
He
was
divested
of
*NL*
his
clothes
,
except
his
shirt
,
whipped
,
and
tied
to
a
large
tree
in
front
*NL*
of
the
house
.
It
was
a
stormy
night
in
winter
.
The
wind
blew
bitterly
cold
,
*NL*
and
the
boughs
of
the
old
tree
crackled
under
falling
sleet
.
A
member
of
*NL*
the
family
,
fearing
he
would
freeze
to
death
,
begged
that
he
might
be
taken
*NL*
down
;
but
the
master
would
not
relent
.
He
remained
there
three
hours
;
and
,
*NL*
when
he
was
cut
down
,
he
was
more
dead
than
alive
.
Another
slave
,
who
stole
*NL*
a
pig
from
this
master
,
to
appease
his
hunger
,
was
terribly
flogged
.
In
*NL*
desperation
,
he
tried
to
run
away
.
But
at
the
end
of
two
miles
,
he
was
so
*NL*
faint
with
loss
of
blood
,
he
thought
he
was
dying
.
He
had
a
wife
,
and
he
*NL*
longed
to
see
her
once
more
.
Too
sick
to
walk
,
he
crept
back
that
long
*NL*
distance
on
his
hands
and
knees
.
When
he
reached
his
master
's
,
it
was
*NL*
night
.
He
had
not
strength
to
rise
and
open
the
gate
.
He
moaned
,
and
tried
*NL*
to
call
for
help
.
I
had
a
friend
living
in
the
same
family
.
At
last
his
cry
*NL*
reached
her
.
She
went
out
and
found
the
prostrate
man
at
the
gate
.
She
ran
*NL*
back
to
the
house
for
assistance
,
and
two
men
returned
with
her
.
They
*NL*
carried
him
in
,
and
laid
him
on
the
floor
.
The
back
of
his
shirt
was
one
*NL*
clot
of
blood
.
By
means
of
lard
,
my
friend
loosened
it
from
the
raw
flesh
.
*NL*
She
bandaged
him
,
gave
him
cool
drink
,
and
left
him
to
rest
.
The
master
*NL*
said
he
deserved
a
hundred
more
lashes
.
When
his
own
labor
was
stolen
from
*NL*
him
,
he
had
stolen
food
to
appease
his
hunger
.
This
was
his
crime
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
neighbor
was
a
Mrs.
Wade
.
At
no
hour
of
the
day
was
there
cessation
*NL*
of
the
lash
on
her
premises
.
Her
labors
began
with
the
dawn
,
and
did
not
*NL*
cease
till
long
after
nightfall
.
The
barn
was
her
particular
place
of
*NL*
torture
.
There
she
lashed
the
slaves
with
the
might
of
a
man
.
An
old
slave
*NL*
of
hers
once
said
to
me
,
``
It
is
hell
in
missis
's
house
.
`
Pears
I
can
never
*NL*
get
out
.
Day
and
night
I
prays
to
die
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
mistress
died
before
the
old
woman
,
and
,
when
dying
,
entreated
her
*NL*
husband
not
to
permit
any
one
of
her
slaves
to
look
on
her
after
death
.
A
*NL*
slave
who
had
nursed
her
children
,
and
had
still
a
child
in
her
care
,
*NL*
watched
her
chance
,
and
stole
with
it
in
her
arms
to
the
room
where
lay
her
*NL*
dead
mistress
.
She
gazed
a
while
on
her
,
then
raised
her
hand
and
dealt
two
*NL*
blows
on
her
face
,
saying
,
as
she
did
so
,
``
The
devil
is
got
you
_
now
_
!
''
She
*NL*
forgot
that
the
child
was
looking
on
.
She
had
just
begun
to
talk
;
and
she
*NL*
said
to
her
father
,
``
I
did
see
ma
,
and
mammy
did
strike
ma
,
so
,
''
striking
*NL*
her
own
face
with
her
little
hand
.
The
master
was
startled
.
He
could
not
*NL*
imagine
how
the
nurse
could
obtain
access
to
the
room
where
the
corpse
lay
;
*NL*
for
he
kept
the
door
locked
.
He
questioned
her
.
She
confessed
that
what
the
*NL*
child
had
said
was
true
,
and
told
how
she
had
procured
the
key
.
She
was
*NL*
sold
to
Georgia
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
my
childhood
I
knew
a
valuable
slave
,
named
Charity
,
and
loved
her
,
as
*NL*
all
children
did
.
Her
young
mistress
married
,
and
took
her
to
Louisiana
.
*NL*
Her
little
boy
,
James
,
was
sold
to
a
good
sort
of
master
.
He
became
*NL*
involved
in
debt
,
and
James
was
sold
again
to
a
wealthy
slaveholder
,
noted
*NL*
for
his
cruelty
.
With
this
man
he
grew
up
to
manhood
,
receiving
the
*NL*
treatment
of
a
dog
.
After
a
severe
whipping
,
to
save
himself
from
further
*NL*
infliction
of
the
lash
,
with
which
he
was
threatened
,
he
took
to
the
woods
.
*NL*
He
was
in
a
most
miserable
condition
--
cut
by
the
cowskin
,
half
naked
,
half
*NL*
starved
,
and
without
the
means
of
procuring
a
crust
of
bread
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
weeks
after
his
escape
,
he
was
captured
,
tied
,
and
carried
back
to
his
*NL*
master
's
plantation
.
This
man
considered
punishment
in
his
jail
,
on
bread
*NL*
and
water
,
after
receiving
hundreds
of
lashes
,
too
mild
for
the
poor
*NL*
slave
's
offence
.
Therefore
he
decided
,
after
the
overseer
should
have
*NL*
whipped
him
to
his
satisfaction
,
to
have
him
placed
between
the
screws
of
*NL*
the
cotton
gin
,
to
stay
as
long
as
he
had
been
in
the
woods
.
This
wretched
*NL*
creature
was
cut
with
the
whip
from
his
head
to
his
feet
,
then
washed
with
*NL*
strong
brine
,
to
prevent
the
flesh
from
mortifying
,
and
make
it
heal
sooner
*NL*
than
it
otherwise
would
.
He
was
then
put
into
the
cotton
gin
,
which
was
*NL*
screwed
down
,
only
allowing
him
room
to
turn
on
his
side
when
he
could
not
*NL*
lie
on
his
back
.
Every
morning
a
slave
was
sent
with
a
piece
of
bread
and
*NL*
bowl
of
water
,
which
was
placed
within
reach
of
the
poor
fellow
.
The
slave
*NL*
was
charged
,
under
penalty
of
severe
punishment
,
not
to
speak
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Four
days
passed
,
and
the
slave
continued
to
carry
the
bread
and
water
.
On
*NL*
the
second
morning
,
he
found
the
bread
gone
,
but
the
water
untouched
.
When
*NL*
he
had
been
in
the
press
four
days
and
five
night
,
the
slave
informed
his
*NL*
master
that
the
water
had
not
been
used
for
four
mornings
,
and
that
*NL*
horrible
stench
came
from
the
gin
house
.
The
overseer
was
sent
to
examine
*NL*
into
it
.
When
the
press
was
unscrewed
,
the
dead
body
was
found
partly
eaten
*NL*
by
rats
and
vermin
.
Perhaps
the
rats
that
devoured
his
bread
had
gnawed
him
*NL*
before
life
was
extinct
.
Poor
Charity
!
Grandmother
and
I
often
asked
each
*NL*
other
how
her
affectionate
heart
would
bear
the
news
,
if
she
should
ever
*NL*
hear
of
the
murder
of
her
son
.
We
had
known
her
husband
,
and
knew
that
*NL*
James
was
like
him
in
manliness
and
intelligence
.
These
were
the
qualities
*NL*
that
made
it
so
hard
for
him
to
be
a
plantation
slave
.
They
put
him
into
a
*NL*
rough
box
,
and
buried
him
with
less
feeling
than
would
have
been
manifested
*NL*
for
an
old
house
dog
.
Nobody
asked
any
questions
.
He
was
a
slave
;
and
the
*NL*
feeling
was
that
the
master
had
a
right
to
do
what
he
pleased
with
his
own
*NL*
property
.
And
what
did
_
he
_
care
for
the
value
of
a
slave
?
He
had
hundreds
*NL*
of
them
.
When
they
had
finished
their
daily
toil
,
they
must
hurry
to
eat
*NL*
their
little
morsels
,
and
be
ready
to
extinguish
their
pine
knots
before
*NL*
nine
o'clock
,
when
the
overseer
went
his
patrol
rounds
.
He
entered
every
*NL*
cabin
,
to
see
that
men
and
their
wives
had
gone
to
bed
together
,
lest
the
*NL*
men
,
from
over-fatigue
,
should
fall
asleep
in
the
chimney
corner
,
and
*NL*
remain
there
till
the
morning
horn
called
them
to
their
daily
task
.
Women
*NL*
are
considered
of
no
value
,
unless
they
continually
increase
their
owner
's
*NL*
stock
.
They
are
put
on
a
par
with
animals
.
This
same
master
shot
a
woman
*NL*
through
the
head
,
who
had
run
away
and
been
brought
back
to
him
.
No
one
*NL*
called
him
to
account
for
it
.
If
a
slave
resisted
being
whipped
,
the
*NL*
bloodhounds
were
unpacked
,
and
set
upon
him
,
to
tear
his
flesh
from
his
*NL*
bones
.
The
master
who
did
these
things
was
highly
educated
,
and
styled
a
*NL*
perfect
gentleman
.
He
also
boasted
the
name
and
standing
of
a
Christian
,
*NL*
though
Satan
never
had
a
truer
follower
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
tell
of
more
slaveholders
as
cruel
as
those
I
have
described
.
They
*NL*
are
not
exceptions
to
the
general
rule
.
I
do
not
say
there
are
no
humane
*NL*
slaveholders
.
Such
characters
do
exist
,
notwithstanding
the
hardening
*NL*
influences
around
them
.
But
they
are
``
like
angels
'
visits
--
few
and
far
*NL*
between
.

*NL*
*NL*
I
knew
a
young
lady
who
was
one
of
these
rare
specimens
.
She
was
an
orphan
,
*NL*
and
inherited
as
slaves
a
woman
and
her
six
children
.
Their
father
was
a
*NL*
free
man
.
They
had
a
comfortable
home
of
their
own
,
parents
and
children
*NL*
living
together
.
The
mother
and
eldest
daughter
served
their
mistress
*NL*
during
the
day
,
and
at
night
returned
to
their
dwelling
,
which
was
on
the
*NL*
premises
.
The
young
lady
was
very
pious
,
and
there
was
some
reality
in
her
*NL*
religion
.
She
taught
her
slaves
to
lead
pure
lives
,
and
wished
them
to
*NL*
enjoy
the
fruit
of
their
own
industry
.
_
Her
_
religion
was
not
a
garb
put
on
*NL*
for
Sunday
,
and
laid
aside
till
Sunday
returned
again
.
The
eldest
daughter
*NL*
of
the
slave
mother
was
promised
in
marriage
to
a
free
man
;
and
the
day
*NL*
before
the
wedding
this
good
mistress
emancipated
her
,
in
order
that
her
*NL*
marriage
might
have
the
sanction
of
_
law
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
Report
said
that
this
young
lady
cherished
an
unrequited
affection
for
a
*NL*
man
who
had
resolved
to
marry
for
wealth
.
In
the
course
of
time
a
rich
*NL*
uncle
of
hers
died
.
He
left
six
thousand
dollars
to
his
two
sons
by
a
*NL*
colored
woman
,
and
the
remainder
of
his
property
to
this
orphan
niece
.
The
*NL*
metal
soon
attracted
the
magnet
.
The
lady
and
her
weighty
purse
became
his
.
*NL*
She
offered
to
manumit
her
slaves
--
telling
them
that
her
marriage
might
*NL*
make
unexpected
changes
in
their
destiny
,
and
she
wished
to
insure
their
*NL*
happiness
.
They
refused
to
take
their
freedom
,
saying
that
she
had
always
*NL*
been
their
best
friend
,
and
they
could
not
be
so
happy
any
where
as
with
*NL*
her
.
I
was
not
surprised
.
I
had
often
seen
them
in
their
comfortable
home
,
*NL*
and
thought
that
the
whole
town
did
not
contain
a
happier
family
.
They
had
*NL*
never
felt
slavery
;
and
,
when
it
was
too
late
,
they
were
convinced
of
its
*NL*
reality
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
new
master
claimed
this
family
as
his
property
,
the
father
became
*NL*
furious
,
and
went
to
his
mistress
for
protection
.
``
I
can
do
nothing
for
you
*NL*
now
,
Harry
,
''
said
she
.
``
I
no
longer
have
the
power
I
had
a
week
ago
.
I
have
*NL*
succeeded
in
obtaining
the
freedom
of
your
wife
;
but
I
can
not
obtain
it
for
*NL*
your
children
.
''
The
unhappy
father
swore
that
nobody
should
take
his
*NL*
children
from
him
.
He
concealed
them
in
the
woods
for
some
days
;
but
they
*NL*
were
discovered
and
taken
.
The
father
was
put
in
jail
,
and
the
two
oldest
*NL*
boys
sold
to
Georgia
.
One
little
girl
,
too
young
to
be
of
service
to
her
*NL*
master
,
was
left
with
the
wretched
mother
.
The
other
three
were
carried
to
*NL*
their
master
's
plantation
.
The
eldest
soon
became
a
mother
;
and
when
the
*NL*
slaveholder
's
wife
looked
at
the
babe
,
she
wept
bitterly
.
She
knew
that
her
*NL*
own
husband
had
violated
the
purity
she
had
so
carefully
inculcated
.
She
*NL*
had
a
second
child
by
her
master
,
and
then
he
sold
her
and
his
offspring
to
*NL*
his
brother
.
She
bore
two
children
to
the
brother
and
was
sold
again
.
The
*NL*
next
sister
went
crazy
.
The
life
she
was
compelled
to
lead
drove
her
mad
.
*NL*
The
third
one
became
the
mother
of
five
daughters
.
Before
the
birth
of
the
*NL*
fourth
the
pious
mistress
died
.
To
the
last
,
she
rendered
every
kindness
to
*NL*
the
slaves
that
her
unfortunate
circumstances
permitted
.
She
passed
away
*NL*
peacefully
,
glad
to
close
her
eyes
on
a
life
which
had
been
made
so
*NL*
wretched
by
the
man
she
loved
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
man
squandered
the
fortune
he
had
received
,
and
sought
to
retrieve
his
*NL*
affairs
by
a
second
marriage
;
but
,
having
retired
after
a
night
of
drunken
*NL*
debauch
,
he
was
found
dead
in
the
morning
.
He
was
called
a
good
master
;
for
*NL*
he
fed
and
clothed
his
slaves
better
than
most
masters
,
and
the
lash
was
*NL*
not
heard
on
his
plantation
so
frequently
as
on
many
others
.
Had
it
not
*NL*
been
for
slavery
,
he
would
have
been
a
better
man
,
and
his
wife
a
happier
*NL*
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
pen
can
give
an
adequate
description
of
the
all-pervading
corruption
*NL*
produced
by
slavery
.
The
slave
girl
is
reared
in
an
atmosphere
of
*NL*
licentiousness
and
fear
.
The
lash
and
the
foul
talk
of
her
master
and
his
*NL*
sons
are
her
teachers
.
When
she
is
fourteen
or
fifteen
,
her
owner
,
or
his
*NL*
sons
,
or
the
overseer
,
or
perhaps
all
of
them
,
begin
to
bribe
her
with
*NL*
presents
.
If
these
fail
to
accomplish
their
purpose
,
she
is
whipped
or
*NL*
starved
into
submission
to
their
will
.
She
may
have
had
religious
*NL*
principles
inculcated
by
some
pious
mother
or
grandmother
,
or
some
good
*NL*
mistress
;
she
may
have
a
lover
,
whose
good
opinion
and
peace
of
mind
are
*NL*
dear
to
her
heart
;
or
the
profligate
men
who
have
power
over
her
may
be
*NL*
exceedingly
odious
to
her
.
But
resistance
is
hopeless
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
worm
*NL*
Shall
prove
her
contest
vain
.
Life
's
little
day
*NL*
Shall
pass
,
and
she
is
gone
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
slaveholder
's
sons
are
,
of
course
,
vitiated
,
even
while
boys
,
by
the
*NL*
unclean
influences
every
where
around
them
.
Nor
do
the
master
's
daughters
*NL*
always
escape
.
Severe
retributions
sometimes
come
upon
him
for
the
wrongs
*NL*
he
does
to
the
daughters
of
the
slaves
.
The
white
daughters
early
hear
*NL*
their
parents
quarrelling
about
some
female
slave
.
Their
curiosity
is
*NL*
excited
,
and
they
soon
learn
the
cause
.
They
are
attended
by
the
young
*NL*
slave
girls
whom
their
father
has
corrupted
;
and
they
hear
such
talk
as
*NL*
should
never
meet
youthful
ears
,
or
any
other
ears
.
They
know
that
the
*NL*
woman
slaves
are
subject
to
their
father
's
authority
in
all
things
;
and
in
*NL*
some
cases
they
exercise
the
same
authority
over
the
men
slaves
.
I
have
*NL*
myself
seen
the
master
of
such
a
household
whose
head
was
bowed
down
in
*NL*
shame
;
for
it
was
known
in
the
neighborhood
that
his
daughter
had
selected
*NL*
one
of
the
meanest
slaves
on
his
plantation
to
be
the
father
of
his
first
*NL*
grandchild
.
She
did
not
make
her
advances
to
her
equals
,
nor
even
to
her
*NL*
father
's
more
intelligent
servants
.
She
selected
the
most
brutalized
,
over
*NL*
whom
her
authority
could
be
exercised
with
less
fear
of
exposure
.
Her
*NL*
father
,
half
frantic
with
rage
,
sought
to
revenge
himself
on
the
offending
*NL*
black
man
;
but
his
daughter
,
foreseeing
the
storm
that
would
arise
,
had
*NL*
given
him
free
papers
,
and
sent
him
out
of
the
state
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
such
cases
the
infant
is
smothered
,
or
sent
where
it
is
never
seen
by
*NL*
any
who
know
its
history
.
But
if
the
white
parent
is
the
_
father
_
,
instead
*NL*
of
the
mother
,
the
offspring
are
unblushingly
reared
for
the
market
.
If
*NL*
they
are
girls
,
I
have
indicated
plainly
enough
what
will
be
their
*NL*
inevitable
destiny
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
may
believe
what
I
say
;
for
I
write
only
that
whereof
I
know
.
I
was
*NL*
twenty-one
years
in
that
cage
of
obscene
birds
.
I
can
testify
,
from
my
own
*NL*
experience
and
observation
,
that
slavery
is
a
curse
to
the
whites
as
well
*NL*
as
to
the
blacks
.
It
makes
white
fathers
cruel
and
sensual
;
the
sons
*NL*
violent
and
licentious
;
it
contaminates
the
daughters
,
and
makes
the
wives
*NL*
wretched
.
And
as
for
the
colored
race
,
it
needs
an
abler
pen
than
mine
to
*NL*
describe
the
extremity
of
their
sufferings
,
the
depth
of
their
degradation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
few
slaveholders
seem
to
be
aware
of
the
widespread
moral
ruin
*NL*
occasioned
by
this
wicked
system
.
Their
talk
is
of
blighted
cotton
*NL*
crops
--
not
of
the
blight
on
their
children
's
souls
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
you
want
to
be
fully
convinced
of
the
abominations
of
slavery
,
go
on
a
*NL*
southern
plantation
,
and
call
yourself
a
negro
trader
.
Then
there
will
be
*NL*
no
concealment
;
and
you
will
see
and
hear
things
that
will
seem
to
you
*NL*
impossible
among
human
beings
with
immortal
souls
.

A
Perilous
Passage
In
The
Slave
Girl
's
Life
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
After
my
lover
went
away
,
Dr.
Flint
contrived
a
new
plan
.
He
seemed
to
have
*NL*
an
idea
that
my
fear
of
my
mistress
was
his
greatest
obstacle
.
In
the
*NL*
blandest
tones
,
he
told
me
that
he
was
going
to
build
a
small
house
for
me
,
*NL*
in
a
secluded
place
,
four
miles
away
from
the
town
.
I
shuddered
;
but
I
was
*NL*
constrained
to
listen
,
while
he
talked
of
his
intention
to
give
me
a
home
*NL*
of
my
own
,
and
to
make
a
lady
of
me
.
Hitherto
,
I
had
escaped
my
dreaded
*NL*
fate
,
by
being
in
the
midst
of
people
.
My
grandmother
had
already
had
high
*NL*
words
with
my
master
about
me
.
She
had
told
him
pretty
plainly
what
she
*NL*
thought
of
his
character
,
and
there
was
considerable
gossip
in
the
*NL*
neighborhood
about
our
affairs
,
to
which
the
open-mouthed
jealousy
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Flint
contributed
not
a
little
.
When
my
master
said
he
was
going
to
build
a
*NL*
house
for
me
,
and
that
he
could
do
it
with
little
trouble
and
expense
,
I
*NL*
was
in
hopes
something
would
happen
to
frustrate
his
scheme
;
but
I
soon
*NL*
heard
that
the
house
was
actually
begun
.
I
vowed
before
my
Maker
that
I
*NL*
would
never
enter
it
:
I
had
rather
toil
on
the
plantation
from
dawn
till
*NL*
dark
;
I
had
rather
live
and
die
in
jail
,
than
drag
on
,
from
day
to
day
,
*NL*
through
such
a
living
death
.
I
was
determined
that
the
master
,
whom
I
so
*NL*
hated
and
loathed
,
who
had
blighted
the
prospects
of
my
youth
,
and
made
my
*NL*
life
a
desert
,
should
not
,
after
my
long
struggle
with
him
,
succeed
at
last
*NL*
in
trampling
his
victim
under
his
feet
.
I
would
do
any
thing
,
every
thing
,
*NL*
for
the
sake
of
defeating
him
.
What
_
could
_
I
do
?
I
thought
and
thought
,
*NL*
till
I
became
desperate
,
and
made
a
plunge
into
the
abyss
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
,
reader
,
I
come
to
a
period
in
my
unhappy
life
,
which
I
would
*NL*
gladly
forget
if
I
could
.
The
remembrance
fills
me
with
sorrow
and
shame
.
*NL*
It
pains
me
to
tell
you
of
it
;
but
I
have
promised
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
*NL*
and
I
will
do
it
honestly
,
let
it
cost
me
what
it
may
.
I
will
not
try
to
*NL*
screen
myself
behind
the
plea
of
compulsion
from
a
master
;
for
it
was
not
*NL*
so
.
Neither
can
I
plead
ignorance
or
thoughtlessness
.
For
years
,
my
master
*NL*
had
done
his
utmost
to
pollute
my
mind
with
foul
images
,
and
to
destroy
the
*NL*
pure
principles
inculcated
by
my
grandmother
,
and
the
good
mistress
of
my
*NL*
childhood
.
The
influences
of
slavery
had
had
the
same
effect
on
me
that
*NL*
they
had
on
other
young
girls
;
they
had
made
me
prematurely
knowing
,
*NL*
concerning
the
evil
ways
of
the
world
.
I
knew
what
I
did
,
and
I
did
it
with
*NL*
deliberate
calculation
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
O
,
ye
happy
women
,
whose
purity
has
been
sheltered
from
childhood
,
who
*NL*
have
been
free
to
choose
the
objects
of
your
affection
,
whose
homes
are
*NL*
protected
by
law
,
do
not
judge
the
poor
desolate
slave
girl
too
severely
!
*NL*
If
slavery
had
been
abolished
,
I
,
also
,
could
have
married
the
man
of
my
*NL*
choice
;
I
could
have
had
a
home
shielded
by
the
laws
;
and
I
should
have
*NL*
been
spared
the
painful
task
of
confessing
what
I
am
now
about
to
relate
;
*NL*
but
all
my
prospects
had
been
blighted
by
slavery
.
I
wanted
to
keep
myself
*NL*
pure
;
and
,
under
the
most
adverse
circumstances
,
I
tried
hard
to
preserve
*NL*
my
self-respect
;
but
I
was
struggling
alone
in
the
powerful
grasp
of
the
*NL*
demon
Slavery
;
and
the
monster
proved
too
strong
for
me
.
I
felt
as
if
I
was
*NL*
forsaken
by
God
and
man
;
as
if
all
my
efforts
must
be
frustrated
;
and
I
*NL*
became
reckless
in
my
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
told
you
that
Dr.
Flint
's
persecutions
and
his
wife
's
jealousy
had
*NL*
given
rise
to
some
gossip
in
the
neighborhood
.
Among
others
,
it
chanced
*NL*
that
a
white
unmarried
gentleman
had
obtained
some
knowledge
of
the
*NL*
circumstances
in
which
I
was
placed
.
He
knew
my
grandmother
,
and
often
*NL*
spoke
to
me
in
the
street
.
He
became
interested
for
me
,
and
asked
questions
*NL*
about
my
master
,
which
I
answered
in
part
.
He
expressed
a
great
deal
of
*NL*
sympathy
,
and
a
wish
to
aid
me
.
He
constantly
sought
opportunities
to
see
*NL*
me
,
and
wrote
to
me
frequently
.
I
was
a
poor
slave
girl
,
only
fifteen
years
*NL*
old
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
much
attention
from
a
superior
person
was
,
of
course
,
flattering
;
for
*NL*
human
nature
is
the
same
in
all
.
I
also
felt
grateful
for
his
sympathy
,
and
*NL*
encouraged
by
his
kind
words
.
It
seemed
to
me
a
great
thing
to
have
such
a
*NL*
friend
.
By
degrees
,
a
more
tender
feeling
crept
into
my
heart
.
He
was
an
*NL*
educated
and
eloquent
gentleman
;
too
eloquent
,
alas
,
for
the
poor
slave
*NL*
girl
who
trusted
in
him
.
Of
course
I
saw
whither
all
this
was
tending
.
I
*NL*
knew
the
impassable
gulf
between
us
;
but
to
be
an
object
of
interest
to
a
*NL*
man
who
is
not
married
,
and
who
is
not
her
master
,
is
agreeable
to
the
*NL*
pride
and
feelings
of
a
slave
,
if
her
miserable
situation
has
left
her
any
*NL*
pride
or
sentiment
.
It
seems
less
degrading
to
give
one
's
self
,
than
to
*NL*
submit
to
compulsion
.
There
is
something
akin
to
freedom
in
having
a
lover
*NL*
who
has
no
control
over
you
,
except
that
which
he
gains
by
kindness
and
*NL*
attachment
.
A
master
may
treat
you
as
rudely
as
he
pleases
,
and
you
dare
*NL*
not
speak
;
moreover
,
the
wrong
does
not
seem
so
great
with
an
unmarried
*NL*
man
,
as
with
one
who
has
a
wife
to
be
made
unhappy
.
There
may
be
sophistry
*NL*
in
all
this
;
but
the
condition
of
a
slave
confuses
all
principles
of
*NL*
morality
,
and
,
in
fact
,
renders
the
practice
of
them
impossible
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
found
that
my
master
had
actually
begun
to
build
the
lonely
cottage
,
*NL*
other
feelings
mixed
with
those
I
have
described
.
Revenge
,
and
calculations
*NL*
of
interest
,
were
added
to
flattered
vanity
and
sincere
gratitude
for
*NL*
kindness
.
I
knew
nothing
would
enrage
Dr.
Flint
so
much
as
to
know
that
I
*NL*
favored
another
,
and
it
was
something
to
triumph
over
my
tyrant
even
in
*NL*
that
small
way
.
I
thought
he
would
revenge
himself
by
selling
me
,
and
I
was
*NL*
sure
my
friend
,
Mr.
Sands
,
would
buy
me
.
He
was
a
man
of
more
generosity
*NL*
and
feeling
than
my
master
,
and
I
thought
my
freedom
could
be
easily
*NL*
obtained
from
him
.
The
crisis
of
my
fate
now
came
so
near
that
I
was
*NL*
desperate
.
I
shuddered
to
think
of
being
the
mother
of
children
that
should
*NL*
be
owned
by
my
old
tyrant
.
I
knew
that
as
soon
as
a
new
fancy
took
him
,
his
*NL*
victims
were
sold
far
off
to
get
rid
of
them
;
especially
if
they
had
*NL*
children
.
I
had
seen
several
women
sold
,
with
babies
at
the
breast
.
He
*NL*
never
allowed
his
offspring
by
slaves
to
remain
long
in
sight
of
himself
*NL*
and
his
wife
.
Of
a
man
who
was
not
my
master
I
could
ask
to
have
my
*NL*
children
well
supported
;
and
in
this
case
,
I
felt
confident
I
should
obtain
*NL*
the
boon
.
I
also
felt
quite
sure
that
they
would
be
made
free
.
With
all
*NL*
these
thoughts
revolving
in
my
mind
,
and
seeing
no
other
way
of
escaping
*NL*
the
doom
I
so
much
dreaded
,
I
made
a
headlong
plunge
.
Pity
me
,
and
pardon
*NL*
me
,
O
virtuous
reader
!
You
never
knew
what
it
is
to
be
a
slave
;
to
be
*NL*
entirely
unprotected
by
law
or
custom
;
to
have
the
laws
reduce
you
to
the
*NL*
condition
of
a
chattel
,
entirely
subject
to
the
will
of
another
.
You
never
*NL*
exhausted
your
ingenuity
in
avoiding
the
snares
,
and
eluding
the
power
of
a
*NL*
hated
tyrant
;
you
never
shuddered
at
the
sound
of
his
footsteps
,
and
*NL*
trembled
within
hearing
of
his
voice
.
I
know
I
did
wrong
.
No
one
can
feel
*NL*
it
more
sensibly
than
I
do
.
The
painful
and
humiliating
memory
will
haunt
*NL*
me
to
my
dying
day
.
Still
,
in
looking
back
,
calmly
,
on
the
events
of
my
*NL*
life
,
I
feel
that
the
slave
woman
ought
not
to
be
judged
by
the
same
*NL*
standard
as
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
months
passed
on
.
I
had
many
unhappy
hours
.
I
secretly
mourned
over
the
*NL*
sorrow
I
was
bringing
on
my
grandmother
,
who
had
so
tried
to
shield
me
from
*NL*
harm
.
I
knew
that
I
was
the
greatest
comfort
of
her
old
age
,
and
that
it
*NL*
was
a
source
of
pride
to
her
that
I
had
not
degraded
myself
,
like
most
of
*NL*
the
slaves
.
I
wanted
to
confess
to
her
that
I
was
no
longer
worthy
of
her
*NL*
love
;
but
I
could
not
utter
the
dreaded
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Dr.
Flint
,
I
had
a
feeling
of
satisfaction
and
triumph
in
the
*NL*
thought
of
telling
_
him
_
.
From
time
to
time
he
told
me
of
his
intended
*NL*
arrangements
,
and
I
was
silent
.
At
last
,
he
came
and
told
me
the
cottage
*NL*
was
completed
,
and
ordered
me
to
go
to
it
.
I
told
him
I
would
never
enter
*NL*
it
.
He
said
,
``
I
have
heard
enough
of
such
talk
as
that
.
You
shall
go
,
if
*NL*
you
are
carried
by
force
;
and
you
shall
remain
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
replied
,
``
I
will
never
go
there
.
In
a
few
months
I
shall
be
a
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
and
looked
at
me
in
dumb
amazement
,
and
left
the
house
without
a
*NL*
word
.
I
thought
I
should
be
happy
in
my
triumph
over
him
.
But
now
that
the
*NL*
truth
was
out
,
and
my
relatives
would
hear
of
it
,
I
felt
wretched
.
Humble
*NL*
as
were
their
circumstances
,
they
had
pride
in
my
good
character
.
Now
,
how
*NL*
could
I
look
at
them
in
the
face
?
My
self-respect
was
gone
!
I
had
resolved
*NL*
that
I
would
be
virtuous
,
though
I
was
a
slave
.
I
had
said
,
``
Let
the
storm
*NL*
beat
!
I
will
brave
it
till
I
die
.
''
And
now
,
how
humiliated
I
felt
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
to
my
grandmother
.
My
lips
moved
to
make
confession
,
but
the
words
*NL*
stuck
in
my
throat
.
I
sat
down
in
the
shade
of
a
tree
at
her
door
and
began
*NL*
to
sew
.
I
think
she
saw
something
unusual
was
the
matter
with
me
.
The
*NL*
mother
of
slaves
is
very
watchful
.
She
knows
there
is
no
security
for
her
*NL*
children
.
After
they
have
entered
their
teens
she
lives
in
daily
*NL*
expectation
of
trouble
.
This
leads
to
many
questions
.
If
the
girl
is
of
a
*NL*
sensitive
nature
,
timidity
keeps
her
from
answering
truthfully
,
and
this
*NL*
well-meant
course
has
a
tendency
to
drive
her
from
maternal
counsels
.
*NL*
Presently
,
in
came
my
mistress
,
like
a
mad
woman
,
and
accused
me
concerning
*NL*
her
husband
.
My
grandmother
,
whose
suspicions
had
been
previously
awakened
,
*NL*
believed
what
she
said
.
She
exclaimed
,
``
O
Linda
!
Has
it
come
to
this
?
I
had
*NL*
rather
see
you
dead
than
to
see
you
as
you
now
are
.
You
are
a
disgrace
to
*NL*
your
dead
mother
.
''
She
tore
from
my
fingers
my
mother
's
wedding
ring
and
*NL*
her
silver
thimble
.
``
Go
away
!
''
she
exclaimed
,
``
and
never
come
to
my
house
,
*NL*
again
.
''
Her
reproaches
fell
so
hot
and
heavy
,
that
they
left
me
no
chance
*NL*
to
answer
.
Bitter
tears
,
such
as
the
eyes
never
shed
but
once
,
were
my
only
*NL*
answer
.
I
rose
from
my
seat
,
but
fell
back
again
,
sobbing
.
She
did
not
*NL*
speak
to
me
;
but
the
tears
were
running
down
her
furrowed
cheeks
,
and
they
*NL*
scorched
me
like
fire
.
She
had
always
been
so
kind
to
me
!
_
So
_
kind
!
How
I
*NL*
longed
to
throw
myself
at
her
feet
,
and
tell
her
all
the
truth
!
But
she
had
*NL*
ordered
me
to
go
,
and
never
to
come
there
again
.
After
a
few
minutes
,
I
*NL*
mustered
strength
,
and
started
to
obey
her
.
With
what
feelings
did
I
now
*NL*
close
that
little
gate
,
which
I
used
to
open
with
such
an
eager
hand
in
my
*NL*
childhood
!
It
closed
upon
me
with
a
sound
I
never
heard
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Where
could
I
go
?
I
was
afraid
to
return
to
my
master
's
.
I
walked
on
*NL*
recklessly
,
not
caring
where
I
went
,
or
what
would
become
of
me
.
When
I
had
*NL*
gone
four
or
five
miles
,
fatigue
compelled
me
to
stop
.
I
sat
down
on
the
*NL*
stump
of
an
old
tree
.
The
stars
were
shining
through
the
boughs
above
me
.
*NL*
How
they
mocked
me
,
with
their
bright
,
calm
light
!
The
hours
passed
by
,
and
*NL*
as
I
sat
there
alone
a
chilliness
and
deadly
sickness
came
over
me
.
I
sank
*NL*
on
the
ground
.
My
mind
was
full
of
horrid
thoughts
.
I
prayed
to
die
;
but
*NL*
the
prayer
was
not
answered
.
At
last
,
with
great
effort
I
roused
myself
,
*NL*
and
walked
some
distance
further
,
to
the
house
of
a
woman
who
had
been
a
*NL*
friend
of
my
mother
.
When
I
told
her
why
I
was
there
,
she
spoke
soothingly
*NL*
to
me
;
but
I
could
not
be
comforted
.
I
thought
I
could
bear
my
shame
if
I
*NL*
could
only
be
reconciled
to
my
grandmother
.
I
longed
to
open
my
heart
to
*NL*
her
.
I
thought
if
she
could
know
the
real
state
of
the
case
,
and
all
I
had
*NL*
been
bearing
for
years
,
she
would
perhaps
judge
me
less
harshly
.
My
friend
*NL*
advised
me
to
send
for
her
.
I
did
so
;
but
days
of
agonizing
suspense
passed
*NL*
before
she
came
.
Had
she
utterly
forsaken
me
?
No
.
She
came
at
last
.
I
knelt
*NL*
before
her
,
and
told
her
the
things
that
had
poisoned
my
life
;
how
long
I
*NL*
had
been
persecuted
;
that
I
saw
no
way
of
escape
;
and
in
an
hour
of
*NL*
extremity
I
had
become
desperate
.
She
listened
in
silence
.
I
told
her
I
*NL*
would
bear
any
thing
and
do
any
thing
,
if
in
time
I
had
hopes
of
obtaining
*NL*
her
forgiveness
.
I
begged
of
her
to
pity
me
,
for
my
dead
mother
's
sake
.
And
*NL*
she
did
pity
me
.
She
did
not
say
,
``
I
forgive
you
;
''
but
she
looked
at
me
*NL*
lovingly
,
with
her
eyes
full
of
tears
.
She
laid
her
old
hand
gently
on
my
*NL*
head
,
and
murmured
,
``
Poor
child
!
Poor
child
!
''
*NL*

XI
.
The
New
Tie
To
Life
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
returned
to
my
good
grandmother
's
house
.
She
had
an
interview
with
Mr.
*NL*
Sands
.
When
she
asked
him
why
he
could
not
have
left
her
one
ewe
*NL*
lamb
,
--
whether
there
were
not
plenty
of
slaves
who
did
not
care
about
*NL*
character
,
--
he
made
no
answer
,
but
he
spoke
kind
and
encouraging
words
.
He
*NL*
promised
to
care
for
my
child
,
and
to
buy
me
,
be
the
conditions
what
they
*NL*
might
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
not
seen
Dr.
Flint
for
five
days
.
I
had
never
seen
him
since
I
made
*NL*
the
avowal
to
him
.
He
talked
of
the
disgrace
I
had
brought
on
myself
;
how
I
*NL*
had
sinned
against
my
master
,
and
mortified
my
old
grandmother
.
He
*NL*
intimated
that
if
I
had
accepted
his
proposals
,
he
,
as
a
physician
,
could
*NL*
have
saved
me
from
exposure
.
He
even
condescended
to
pity
me
.
Could
he
have
*NL*
offered
wormwood
more
bitter
?
He
,
whose
persecutions
had
been
the
cause
of
*NL*
my
sin
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Linda
,
''
said
he
,
``
though
you
have
been
criminal
towards
me
,
I
feel
for
*NL*
you
,
and
I
can
pardon
you
if
you
obey
my
wishes
.
Tell
me
whether
the
fellow
*NL*
you
wanted
to
marry
is
the
father
of
your
child
.
If
you
deceive
me
,
you
*NL*
shall
feel
the
fires
of
hell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
not
feel
as
proud
as
I
had
done
.
My
strongest
weapon
with
him
was
*NL*
gone
.
I
was
lowered
in
my
own
estimation
,
and
had
resolved
to
bear
his
*NL*
abuse
in
silence
.
But
when
he
spoke
contemptuously
of
the
lover
who
had
*NL*
always
treated
me
honorably
;
when
I
remembered
that
but
for
_
him
_
I
might
*NL*
have
been
a
virtuous
,
free
,
and
happy
wife
,
I
lost
my
patience
.
``
I
have
*NL*
sinned
against
God
and
myself
,
''
I
replied
;
``
but
not
against
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
clinched
his
teeth
,
and
muttered
,
``
Curse
you
!
''
He
came
towards
me
,
with
*NL*
ill-suppressed
rage
,
and
exclaimed
,
``
You
obstinate
girl
!
I
could
grind
your
*NL*
bones
to
powder
!
You
have
thrown
yourself
away
on
some
worthless
rascal
.
*NL*
You
are
weak-minded
,
and
have
been
easily
persuaded
by
those
who
do
n't
care
*NL*
a
straw
for
you
.
The
future
will
settle
accounts
between
us
.
You
are
*NL*
blinded
now
;
but
hereafter
you
will
be
convinced
that
your
master
was
your
*NL*
best
friend
.
My
lenity
towards
you
is
a
proof
of
it
.
I
might
have
punished
*NL*
you
in
many
ways
.
I
might
have
whipped
till
you
fell
dead
under
the
lash
.
*NL*
But
I
wanted
you
to
live
;
I
would
have
bettered
your
condition
.
Others
*NL*
can
not
do
it
.
You
are
my
slave
.
Your
mistress
,
disgusted
by
your
conduct
,
*NL*
forbids
you
to
return
to
the
house
;
therefore
I
leave
you
here
for
the
*NL*
present
;
but
I
shall
see
you
often
.
I
will
call
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
with
frowning
brows
,
that
showed
a
dissatisfied
state
of
mind
.
*NL*
After
asking
about
my
health
,
he
inquired
whether
my
board
was
paid
,
and
*NL*
who
visited
me
.
He
then
went
on
to
say
that
he
had
neglected
his
duty
;
that
*NL*
as
a
physician
there
were
certain
things
that
he
ought
to
have
explained
to
*NL*
me
.
Then
followed
talk
such
as
would
have
made
the
most
shameless
blush
.
He
*NL*
ordered
me
to
stand
up
before
him
.
I
obeyed
.
``
I
command
you
,
''
said
he
,
``
to
*NL*
tell
me
whether
the
father
of
your
child
is
white
or
black
.
''
I
hesitated
.
*NL*
``
Answer
me
this
instant
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
I
did
answer
.
He
sprang
upon
me
*NL*
like
a
wolf
,
and
grabbed
my
arm
as
if
he
would
have
broken
it
.
``
Do
you
love
*NL*
him
?
''
said
he
,
in
a
hissing
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
thankful
that
I
do
not
despise
him
,
''
I
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
raised
his
hand
to
strike
me
;
but
it
fell
again
.
I
do
n't
know
what
*NL*
arrested
the
blow
.
He
sat
down
,
with
lips
tightly
compressed
.
At
last
he
*NL*
spoke
.
``
I
came
here
,
''
said
he
,
``
to
make
you
a
friendly
proposition
;
but
*NL*
your
ingratitude
chafes
me
beyond
endurance
.
You
turn
aside
all
my
good
*NL*
intentions
towards
you
.
I
do
n't
know
what
it
is
that
keeps
me
from
killing
*NL*
you
.
''
Again
he
rose
,
as
if
he
had
a
mind
to
strike
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
resumed
.
``
On
one
condition
I
will
forgive
your
insolence
and
crime
.
*NL*
You
must
henceforth
have
no
communication
of
any
kind
with
the
father
of
*NL*
your
child
.
You
must
not
ask
any
thing
from
him
,
or
receive
any
thing
from
*NL*
him
.
I
will
take
care
of
you
and
your
child
.
You
had
better
promise
this
at
*NL*
once
,
and
not
wait
till
you
are
deserted
by
him
.
This
is
the
last
act
of
*NL*
mercy
I
shall
show
towards
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
something
about
being
unwilling
to
have
my
child
supported
by
a
man
*NL*
who
had
cursed
it
and
me
also
.
He
rejoined
,
that
a
woman
who
had
sunk
to
my
*NL*
level
had
no
right
to
expect
any
thing
else
.
He
asked
,
for
the
last
time
,
*NL*
would
I
accept
his
kindness
?
I
answered
that
I
would
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
said
he
;
``
then
take
the
consequences
of
your
wayward
course
.
*NL*
Never
look
to
me
for
help
.
You
are
my
slave
,
and
shall
always
be
my
slave
.
*NL*
I
will
never
sell
you
,
that
you
may
depend
upon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hope
died
away
in
my
heart
as
he
closed
the
door
after
him
.
I
had
*NL*
calculated
that
in
his
rage
he
would
sell
me
to
a
slave-trader
;
and
I
knew
*NL*
the
father
of
my
child
was
on
the
watch
to
buy
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
this
time
my
uncle
Phillip
was
expected
to
return
from
a
voyage
.
The
*NL*
day
before
his
departure
I
had
officiated
as
bridesmaid
to
a
young
friend
.
*NL*
My
heart
was
then
ill
at
ease
,
but
my
smiling
countenance
did
not
betray
*NL*
it
.
Only
a
year
had
passed
;
but
what
fearful
changes
it
had
wrought
!
My
*NL*
heart
had
grown
gray
in
misery
.
Lives
that
flash
in
sunshine
,
and
lives
*NL*
that
are
born
in
tears
,
receive
their
hue
from
circumstances
.
None
of
us
*NL*
know
what
a
year
may
bring
forth
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
no
joy
when
they
told
me
my
uncle
had
come
.
He
wanted
to
see
me
,
*NL*
though
he
knew
what
had
happened
.
I
shrank
from
him
at
first
;
but
at
last
*NL*
consented
that
he
should
come
to
my
room
.
He
received
me
as
he
always
had
*NL*
done
.
O
,
how
my
heart
smote
me
when
I
felt
his
tears
on
my
burning
cheeks
!
*NL*
The
words
of
my
grandmother
came
to
my
mind
,
--
``
Perhaps
your
mother
and
*NL*
father
are
taken
from
the
evil
days
to
come
.
''
My
disappointed
heart
could
*NL*
now
praise
God
that
it
was
so
.
But
why
,
thought
I
,
did
my
relatives
ever
*NL*
cherish
hopes
for
me
?
What
was
there
to
save
me
from
the
usual
fate
of
*NL*
slave
girls
?
Many
more
beautiful
and
more
intelligent
than
I
had
*NL*
experienced
a
similar
fate
,
or
a
far
worse
one
.
How
could
they
hope
that
I
*NL*
should
escape
?
*NL*
*NL*
My
uncle
's
stay
was
short
,
and
I
was
not
sorry
for
it
.
I
was
too
ill
in
*NL*
mind
and
body
to
enjoy
my
friends
as
I
had
done
.
For
some
weeks
I
was
*NL*
unable
to
leave
my
bed
.
I
could
not
have
any
doctor
but
my
master
,
and
I
*NL*
would
not
have
him
sent
for
.
At
last
,
alarmed
by
my
increasing
illness
,
*NL*
they
sent
for
him
.
I
was
very
weak
and
nervous
;
and
as
soon
as
he
entered
*NL*
the
room
,
I
began
to
scream
.
They
told
him
my
state
was
very
critical
.
He
*NL*
had
no
wish
to
hasten
me
out
of
the
world
,
and
he
withdrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
my
babe
was
born
,
they
said
it
was
premature
.
It
weighed
only
four
*NL*
pounds
;
but
God
let
it
live
.
I
heard
the
doctor
say
I
could
not
survive
*NL*
till
morning
.
I
had
often
prayed
for
death
;
but
now
I
did
not
want
to
die
,
*NL*
unless
my
child
could
die
too
.
Many
weeks
passed
before
I
was
able
to
leave
*NL*
my
bed
.
I
was
a
mere
wreck
of
my
former
self
.
For
a
year
there
was
scarcely
*NL*
a
day
when
I
was
free
from
chills
and
fever
.
My
babe
also
was
sickly
.
His
*NL*
little
limbs
were
often
racked
with
pain
.
Dr.
Flint
continued
his
visits
,
*NL*
to
look
after
my
health
;
and
he
did
not
fail
to
remind
me
that
my
child
was
*NL*
an
addition
to
his
stock
of
slaves
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
too
feeble
to
dispute
with
him
,
and
listened
to
his
remarks
in
*NL*
silence
.
His
visits
were
less
frequent
;
but
his
busy
spirit
could
not
*NL*
remain
quiet
.
He
employed
my
brother
in
his
office
;
and
he
was
made
the
*NL*
medium
of
frequent
notes
and
messages
to
me
.
William
was
a
bright
lad
,
and
*NL*
of
much
use
to
the
doctor
.
He
had
learned
to
put
up
medicines
,
to
leech
,
*NL*
cup
,
and
bleed
.
He
had
taught
himself
to
read
and
spell
.
I
was
proud
of
my
*NL*
brother
,
and
the
old
doctor
suspected
as
much
.
One
day
,
when
I
had
not
seen
*NL*
him
for
several
weeks
,
I
heard
his
steps
approaching
the
door
.
I
dreaded
*NL*
the
encounter
,
and
hid
myself
.
He
inquired
for
me
,
of
course
;
but
I
was
*NL*
nowhere
to
be
found
.
He
went
to
his
office
,
and
despatched
William
with
a
*NL*
note
.
The
color
mounted
to
my
brother
's
face
when
he
gave
it
to
me
;
and
he
*NL*
said
,
``
Do
n't
you
hate
me
,
Linda
,
for
bringing
you
these
things
?
''
I
told
him
*NL*
I
could
not
blame
him
;
he
was
a
slave
,
and
obliged
to
obey
his
master
's
*NL*
will
.
The
note
ordered
me
to
come
to
his
office
.
I
went
.
He
demanded
to
*NL*
know
where
I
was
when
he
called
.
I
told
him
I
was
at
home
.
He
flew
into
a
*NL*
passion
,
and
said
he
knew
better
.
Then
he
launched
out
upon
his
usual
*NL*
themes
,
--
my
crimes
against
him
,
and
my
ingratitude
for
his
forbearance
.
The
*NL*
laws
were
laid
down
to
me
anew
,
and
I
was
dismissed
.
I
felt
humiliated
that
*NL*
my
brother
should
stand
by
,
and
listen
to
such
language
as
would
be
*NL*
addressed
only
to
a
slave
.
Poor
boy
!
He
was
powerless
to
defend
me
;
but
I
*NL*
saw
the
tears
,
which
he
vainly
strove
to
keep
back
.
The
manifestation
of
*NL*
feeling
irritated
the
doctor
.
William
could
do
nothing
to
please
him
.
One
*NL*
morning
he
did
not
arrive
at
the
office
so
early
as
usual
;
and
that
*NL*
circumstance
afforded
his
master
an
opportunity
to
vent
his
spleen
.
He
was
*NL*
put
in
jail
.
The
next
day
my
brother
sent
a
trader
to
the
doctor
,
with
a
*NL*
request
to
be
sold
.
His
master
was
greatly
incensed
at
what
he
called
his
*NL*
insolence
.
He
said
he
had
put
him
there
,
to
reflect
upon
his
bad
conduct
,
*NL*
and
he
certainly
was
not
giving
any
evidence
of
repentance
.
For
two
days
he
*NL*
harassed
himself
to
find
somebody
to
do
his
office
work
;
but
every
thing
*NL*
went
wrong
without
William
.
He
was
released
,
and
ordered
to
take
his
old
*NL*
stand
,
with
many
threats
,
if
he
was
not
careful
about
his
future
behavior
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
months
passed
on
,
my
boy
improved
in
health
.
When
he
was
a
year
old
,
*NL*
they
called
him
beautiful
.
The
little
vine
was
taking
deep
root
in
my
*NL*
existence
,
though
its
clinging
fondness
excited
a
mixture
of
love
and
pain
.
*NL*
When
I
was
most
sorely
oppressed
I
found
a
solace
in
his
smiles
.
I
loved
to
*NL*
watch
his
infant
slumbers
;
but
always
there
was
a
dark
cloud
over
my
*NL*
enjoyment
.
I
could
never
forget
that
he
was
a
slave
.
Sometimes
I
wished
*NL*
that
he
might
die
in
infancy
.
God
tried
me
.
My
darling
became
very
ill
.
The
*NL*
bright
eyes
grew
dull
,
and
the
little
feet
and
hands
were
so
icy
cold
that
*NL*
I
thought
death
had
already
touched
them
.
I
had
prayed
for
his
death
,
but
*NL*
never
so
earnestly
as
I
now
prayed
for
his
life
;
and
my
prayer
was
heard
.
*NL*
Alas
,
what
mockery
it
is
for
a
slave
mother
to
try
to
pray
back
her
dying
*NL*
child
to
life
!
Death
is
better
than
slavery
.
It
was
a
sad
thought
that
I
*NL*
had
no
name
to
give
my
child
.
His
father
caressed
him
and
treated
him
*NL*
kindly
,
whenever
he
had
a
chance
to
see
him
.
He
was
not
unwilling
that
he
*NL*
should
bear
his
name
;
but
he
had
no
legal
claim
to
it
;
and
if
I
had
*NL*
bestowed
it
upon
him
,
my
master
would
have
regarded
it
as
a
new
crime
,
a
*NL*
new
piece
of
insolence
,
and
would
,
perhaps
,
revenge
it
on
the
boy
.
O
,
the
*NL*
serpent
of
Slavery
has
many
and
poisonous
fangs
!

Fear
Of
Insurrection
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Not
far
from
this
time
Nat
Turner
's
insurrection
broke
out
;
and
the
news
*NL*
threw
our
town
into
great
commotion
.
Strange
that
they
should
be
alarmed
,
*NL*
when
their
slaves
were
so
``
contented
and
happy
''
!
But
so
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
always
the
custom
to
have
a
muster
every
year
.
On
that
occasion
*NL*
every
white
man
shouldered
his
musket
.
The
citizens
and
the
so-called
*NL*
country
gentlemen
wore
military
uniforms
.
The
poor
whites
took
their
places
*NL*
in
the
ranks
in
every-day
dress
,
some
without
shoes
,
some
without
hats
.
*NL*
This
grand
occasion
had
already
passed
;
and
when
the
slaves
were
told
there
*NL*
was
to
be
another
muster
,
they
were
surprised
and
rejoiced
.
Poor
creatures
!
*NL*
They
thought
it
was
going
to
be
a
holiday
.
I
was
informed
of
the
true
state
*NL*
of
affairs
,
and
imparted
it
to
the
few
I
could
trust
.
Most
gladly
would
I
*NL*
have
proclaimed
it
to
every
slave
;
but
I
dared
not
.
All
could
not
be
relied
*NL*
on
.
Mighty
is
the
power
of
the
torturing
lash
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
sunrise
,
people
were
pouring
in
from
every
quarter
within
twenty
miles
*NL*
of
the
town
.
I
knew
the
houses
were
to
be
searched
;
and
I
expected
it
would
*NL*
be
done
by
country
bullies
and
the
poor
whites
.
I
knew
nothing
annoyed
them
*NL*
so
much
as
to
see
colored
people
living
in
comfort
and
respectability
;
so
I
*NL*
made
arrangements
for
them
with
especial
care
.
I
arranged
every
thing
in
my
*NL*
grandmother
's
house
as
neatly
as
possible
.
I
put
white
quilts
on
the
beds
,
*NL*
and
decorated
some
of
the
rooms
with
flowers
.
When
all
was
arranged
,
I
sat
*NL*
down
at
the
window
to
watch
.
Far
as
my
eye
could
reach
,
it
rested
on
a
*NL*
motley
crowd
of
soldiers
.
Drums
and
fifes
were
discoursing
martial
music
.
*NL*
The
men
were
divided
into
companies
of
sixteen
,
each
headed
by
a
captain
.
*NL*
Orders
were
given
,
and
the
wild
scouts
rushed
in
every
direction
,
wherever
*NL*
a
colored
face
was
to
be
found
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
grand
opportunity
for
the
low
whites
,
who
had
no
negroes
of
their
*NL*
own
to
scourge
.
They
exulted
in
such
a
chance
to
exercise
a
little
brief
*NL*
authority
,
and
show
their
subserviency
to
the
slaveholders
;
not
reflecting
*NL*
that
the
power
which
trampled
on
the
colored
people
also
kept
themselves
in
*NL*
poverty
,
ignorance
,
and
moral
degradation
.
Those
who
never
witnessed
such
*NL*
scenes
can
hardly
believe
what
I
know
was
inflicted
at
this
time
on
*NL*
innocent
men
,
women
,
and
children
,
against
whom
there
was
not
the
slightest
*NL*
ground
for
suspicion
.
Colored
people
and
slaves
who
lived
in
remote
parts
*NL*
of
the
town
suffered
in
an
especial
manner
.
In
some
cases
the
searchers
*NL*
scattered
powder
and
shot
among
their
clothes
,
and
then
sent
other
parties
*NL*
to
find
them
,
and
bring
them
forward
as
proof
that
they
were
plotting
*NL*
insurrection
.
Every
where
men
,
women
,
and
children
were
whipped
till
the
*NL*
blood
stood
in
puddles
at
their
feet
.
Some
received
five
hundred
lashes
;
*NL*
others
were
tied
hands
and
feet
,
and
tortured
with
a
bucking
paddle
,
which
*NL*
blisters
the
skin
terribly
.
The
dwellings
of
the
colored
people
,
unless
*NL*
they
happened
to
be
protected
by
some
influential
white
person
,
who
was
*NL*
nigh
at
hand
,
were
robbed
of
clothing
and
every
thing
else
the
marauders
*NL*
thought
worth
carrying
away
.
All
day
long
these
unfeeling
wretches
went
*NL*
round
,
like
a
troop
of
demons
,
terrifying
and
tormenting
the
helpless
.
At
*NL*
night
,
they
formed
themselves
into
patrol
bands
,
and
went
wherever
they
*NL*
chose
among
the
colored
people
,
acting
out
their
brutal
will
.
Many
women
*NL*
hid
themselves
in
woods
and
swamps
,
to
keep
out
of
their
way
.
If
any
of
the
*NL*
husbands
or
fathers
told
of
these
outrages
,
they
were
tied
up
to
the
public
*NL*
whipping
post
,
and
cruelly
scourged
for
telling
lies
about
white
men
.
The
*NL*
consternation
was
universal
.
No
two
people
that
had
the
slightest
tinge
of
*NL*
color
in
their
faces
dared
to
be
seen
talking
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
entertained
no
positive
fears
about
our
household
,
because
we
were
in
the
*NL*
midst
of
white
families
who
would
protect
us
.
We
were
ready
to
receive
the
*NL*
soldiers
whenever
they
came
.
It
was
not
long
before
we
heard
the
tramp
of
*NL*
feet
and
the
sound
of
voices
.
The
door
was
rudely
pushed
open
;
and
in
they
*NL*
tumbled
,
like
a
pack
of
hungry
wolves
.
They
snatched
at
every
thing
within
*NL*
their
reach
.
Every
box
,
trunk
,
closet
,
and
corner
underwent
a
thorough
*NL*
examination
.
A
box
in
one
of
the
drawers
containing
some
silver
change
was
*NL*
eagerly
pounced
upon
.
When
I
stepped
forward
to
take
it
from
them
,
one
of
*NL*
the
soldiers
turned
and
said
angrily
,
``
What
d'ye
foller
us
fur
?
D'ye
s
`
pose
*NL*
white
folks
is
come
to
steal
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
replied
,
``
You
have
come
to
search
;
but
you
have
searched
that
box
,
and
I
*NL*
will
take
it
,
if
you
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
I
saw
a
white
gentleman
who
was
friendly
to
us
;
and
I
called
*NL*
to
him
,
and
asked
him
to
have
the
goodness
to
come
in
and
stay
till
the
*NL*
search
was
over
.
He
readily
complied
.
His
entrance
into
the
house
brought
*NL*
in
the
captain
of
the
company
,
whose
business
it
was
to
guard
the
outside
*NL*
of
the
house
,
and
see
that
none
of
the
inmates
left
it
.
This
officer
was
*NL*
Mr.
Litch
,
the
wealthy
slaveholder
whom
I
mentioned
,
in
the
account
of
*NL*
neighboring
planters
,
as
being
notorious
for
his
cruelty
.
He
felt
above
*NL*
soiling
his
hands
with
the
search
.
He
merely
gave
orders
;
and
,
if
a
bit
of
*NL*
writing
was
discovered
,
it
was
carried
to
him
by
his
ignorant
followers
,
*NL*
who
were
unable
to
read
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
grandmother
had
a
large
trunk
of
bedding
and
table
cloths
.
When
that
was
*NL*
opened
,
there
was
a
great
shout
of
surprise
;
and
one
exclaimed
,
``
Where
'd
*NL*
the
damned
niggers
git
all
dis
sheet
an
'
table
clarf
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
grandmother
,
emboldened
by
the
presence
of
our
white
protector
said
,
*NL*
``
You
may
be
sure
we
did
n't
pilfer
'em
from
_
your
_
houses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
,
mammy
,
''
said
a
grim-looking
fellow
without
any
coat
,
``
you
seem
*NL*
to
feel
mighty
gran
'
'cause
you
got
all
them
`
ere
fixens
.
White
folks
*NL*
oughter
have
'em
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
remarks
were
interrupted
by
a
chorus
of
voices
shouting
,
``
We
's
got
'em
!
*NL*
We
's
got
'em
!
Dis
`
ere
yaller
gal
's
got
letters
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
general
rush
for
the
supposed
letter
,
which
,
upon
examination
,
*NL*
proved
to
be
some
verses
written
to
me
by
a
friend
.
In
packing
away
my
*NL*
things
,
I
had
overlooked
them
.
When
their
captain
informed
them
of
their
*NL*
contents
,
they
seemed
much
disappointed
.
He
inquired
of
me
who
wrote
them
.
*NL*
I
told
him
it
was
one
of
my
friends
.
``
Can
you
read
them
?
''
he
asked
.
When
I
*NL*
told
him
I
could
,
he
swore
,
and
raved
,
and
tore
the
paper
into
bits
.
``
Bring
*NL*
me
all
your
letters
!
''
said
he
,
in
commanding
tone
.
I
told
him
I
had
none
.
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
afraid
,
''
he
continued
,
in
an
insinuating
way
.
``
Bring
them
all
to
*NL*
me
.
Nobody
shall
do
you
any
harm
.
''
Seeing
I
did
not
move
to
obey
him
,
his
*NL*
pleasant
tone
changed
to
oaths
and
threats
.
``
Who
writes
to
you
?
half
free
*NL*
niggers
?
''
inquired
he
.
I
replied
,
``
O
,
no
;
most
of
my
letters
are
from
white
*NL*
people
.
Some
request
me
to
burn
them
after
they
are
read
,
and
some
I
*NL*
destroy
without
reading
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
An
exclamation
of
surprise
from
some
of
the
company
put
a
stop
to
our
*NL*
conversation
.
Some
silver
spoons
which
ornamented
an
old-fashioned
buffet
*NL*
had
just
been
discovered
.
My
grandmother
was
in
the
habit
of
preserving
*NL*
fruit
for
many
ladies
in
the
town
,
and
of
preparing
suppers
for
parties
;
*NL*
consequently
she
had
many
jars
of
preserves
.
The
closet
that
contained
*NL*
these
was
next
invaded
,
and
the
contents
tasted
.
One
of
them
,
who
was
*NL*
helping
himself
freely
,
tapped
his
neighbor
on
the
shoulder
,
and
said
,
``
Wal
*NL*
done
!
Do
n't
wonder
de
niggers
want
to
kill
all
de
white
folks
,
when
dey

live
on
`
sarves
''
-LSB-
meaning
preserves
-RSB-
.
I
stretched
out
my
hand
to
take
the
*NL*
jar
,
saying
,
``
You
were
not
sent
here
to
search
for
sweetmeats
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
_
were
_
we
sent
for
?
''
said
the
captain
,
bristling
up
to
me
.
I
*NL*
evaded
the
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
search
of
the
house
was
completed
,
and
nothing
found
to
condemn
us
.
*NL*
They
next
proceeded
to
the
garden
,
and
knocked
about
every
bush
and
vine
,
*NL*
with
no
better
success
.
The
captain
called
his
men
together
,
and
,
after
a
*NL*
short
consultation
,
the
order
to
march
was
given
.
As
they
passed
out
of
the
*NL*
gate
,
the
captain
turned
back
,
and
pronounced
a
malediction
on
the
house
.
*NL*
He
said
it
ought
to
be
burned
to
the
ground
,
and
each
of
its
inmates
*NL*
receive
thirty-nine
lashes
.
We
came
out
of
this
affair
very
fortunately
;
*NL*
not
losing
any
thing
except
some
wearing
apparel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
evening
the
turbulence
increased
.
The
soldiers
,
stimulated
by
*NL*
drink
,
committed
still
greater
cruelties
.
Shrieks
and
shouts
continually
*NL*
rent
the
air
.
Not
daring
to
go
to
the
door
,
I
peeped
under
the
window
*NL*
curtain
.
I
saw
a
mob
dragging
along
a
number
of
colored
people
,
each
white
*NL*
man
,
with
his
musket
upraised
,
threatening
instant
death
if
they
did
not
*NL*
stop
their
shrieks
.
Among
the
prisoners
was
a
respectable
old
colored
*NL*
minister
.
They
had
found
a
few
parcels
of
shot
in
his
house
,
which
his
wife
*NL*
had
for
years
used
to
balance
her
scales
.
For
this
they
were
going
to
shoot
*NL*
him
on
Court
House
Green
.
What
a
spectacle
was
that
for
a
civilized
*NL*
country
!
A
rabble
,
staggering
under
intoxication
,
assuming
to
be
the
*NL*
administrators
of
justice
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
better
class
of
the
community
exerted
their
influence
to
save
the
*NL*
innocent
,
persecuted
people
;
and
in
several
instances
they
succeeded
,
by
*NL*
keeping
them
shut
up
in
jail
till
the
excitement
abated
.
At
last
the
white
*NL*
citizens
found
that
their
own
property
was
not
safe
from
the
lawless
rabble
*NL*
they
had
summoned
to
protect
them
.
They
rallied
the
drunken
swarm
,
drove
*NL*
them
back
into
the
country
,
and
set
a
guard
over
the
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
,
the
town
patrols
were
commissioned
to
search
colored
people
*NL*
that
lived
out
of
the
city
;
and
the
most
shocking
outrages
were
committed
*NL*
with
perfect
impunity
.
Every
day
for
a
fortnight
,
if
I
looked
out
,
I
saw
*NL*
horsemen
with
some
poor
panting
negro
tied
to
their
saddles
,
and
compelled
*NL*
by
the
lash
to
keep
up
with
their
speed
,
till
they
arrived
at
the
jail
*NL*
yard
.
Those
who
had
been
whipped
too
unmercifully
to
walk
were
washed
with
*NL*
brine
,
tossed
into
a
cart
,
and
carried
to
jail
.
One
black
man
,
who
had
not
*NL*
fortitude
to
endure
scourging
,
promised
to
give
information
about
the
*NL*
conspiracy
.
But
it
turned
out
that
he
knew
nothing
at
all
.
He
had
not
even
*NL*
heard
the
name
of
Nat
Turner
.
The
poor
fellow
had
,
however
,
made
up
a
*NL*
story
,
which
augmented
his
own
sufferings
and
those
of
the
colored
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
patrol
continued
for
some
weeks
,
and
at
sundown
a
night
guard
was
*NL*
substituted
.
Nothing
at
all
was
proved
against
the
colored
people
,
bond
or
*NL*
free
.
The
wrath
of
the
slaveholders
was
somewhat
appeased
by
the
capture
of
*NL*
Nat
Turner
.
The
imprisoned
were
released
.
The
slaves
were
sent
to
their
*NL*
masters
,
and
the
free
were
permitted
to
return
to
their
ravaged
homes
.
*NL*
Visiting
was
strictly
forbidden
on
the
plantations
.
The
slaves
begged
the
*NL*
privilege
of
again
meeting
at
their
little
church
in
the
woods
,
with
their
*NL*
burying
ground
around
it
.
It
was
built
by
the
colored
people
,
and
they
had
*NL*
no
higher
happiness
than
to
meet
there
and
sing
hymns
together
,
and
pour
*NL*
out
their
hearts
in
spontaneous
prayer
.
Their
request
was
denied
,
and
the
*NL*
church
was
demolished
.
They
were
permitted
to
attend
the
white
churches
,
a
*NL*
certain
portion
of
the
galleries
being
appropriated
to
their
use
.
There
,
*NL*
when
every
body
else
had
partaken
of
the
communion
,
and
the
benediction
had
*NL*
been
pronounced
,
the
minister
said
,
``
Come
down
,
now
,
my
colored
friends
.
''
*NL*
They
obeyed
the
summons
,
and
partook
of
the
bread
and
wine
,
in
*NL*
commemoration
of
the
meek
and
lowly
Jesus
,
who
said
,
``
God
is
your
Father
,
*NL*
and
all
ye
are
brethren
.

The
Church
And
Slavery
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
alarm
caused
by
Nat
Turner
's
insurrection
had
subsided
,
the
*NL*
slaveholders
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
would
be
well
to
give
the
*NL*
slaves
enough
of
religious
instruction
to
keep
them
from
murdering
their
*NL*
masters
.
The
Episcopal
clergyman
offered
to
hold
a
separate
service
on
*NL*
Sundays
for
their
benefit
.
His
colored
members
were
very
few
,
and
also
very
*NL*
respectable
--
a
fact
which
I
presume
had
some
weight
with
him
.
The
*NL*
difficulty
was
to
decide
on
a
suitable
place
for
them
to
worship
.
The
*NL*
Methodist
and
Baptist
churches
admitted
them
in
the
afternoon
;
but
their
*NL*
carpets
and
cushions
were
not
so
costly
as
those
at
the
Episcopal
church
.
*NL*
It
was
at
last
decided
that
they
should
meet
at
the
house
of
a
free
colored
*NL*
man
,
who
was
a
member
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
invited
to
attend
,
because
I
could
read
.
Sunday
evening
came
,
and
,
*NL*
trusting
to
the
cover
of
night
,
I
ventured
out
.
I
rarely
ventured
out
by
*NL*
daylight
,
for
I
always
went
with
fear
,
expecting
at
every
turn
to
encounter
*NL*
Dr.
Flint
,
who
was
sure
to
turn
me
back
,
or
order
me
to
his
office
to
*NL*
inquire
where
I
got
my
bonnet
,
or
some
other
article
of
dress
.
When
the
*NL*
Rev.
Mr.
Pike
came
,
there
were
some
twenty
persons
present
.
The
reverend
*NL*
gentleman
knelt
in
prayer
,
then
seated
himself
,
and
requested
all
present
,
*NL*
who
could
read
,
to
open
their
books
,
while
he
gave
out
the
portions
he
*NL*
wished
them
to
repeat
or
respond
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
text
was
,
``
Servants
,
be
obedient
to
them
that
are
your
masters
*NL*
according
to
the
flesh
,
with
fear
and
trembling
,
in
singleness
of
your
*NL*
heart
,
as
unto
Christ
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pious
Mr.
Pike
brushed
up
his
hair
till
it
stood
upright
,
and
,
in
deep
,
*NL*
solemn
tones
,
began
:
``
Hearken
,
ye
servants
!
Give
strict
heed
unto
my
words
.
*NL*
You
are
rebellious
sinners
.
Your
hearts
are
filled
with
all
manner
of
evil
.
*NL*
'T
is
the
devil
who
tempts
you
.
God
is
angry
with
you
,
and
will
surely
*NL*
punish
you
,
if
you
do
n't
forsake
your
wicked
ways
.
You
that
live
in
town
*NL*
are
eyeservants
behind
your
master
's
back
.
Instead
of
serving
your
masters
*NL*
faithfully
,
which
is
pleasing
in
the
sight
of
your
heavenly
Master
,
you
are
*NL*
idle
,
and
shirk
your
work
.
God
sees
you
.
You
tell
lies
.
God
hears
you
.
*NL*
Instead
of
being
engaged
in
worshipping
him
,
you
are
hidden
away
somewhere
,
*NL*
feasting
on
your
master
's
substance
;
tossing
coffee-grounds
with
some
*NL*
wicked
fortuneteller
,
or
cutting
cards
with
another
old
hag
.
Your
masters
*NL*
may
not
find
you
out
,
but
God
sees
you
,
and
will
punish
you
.
O
,
the
*NL*
depravity
of
your
hearts
!
When
your
master
's
work
is
done
,
are
you
quietly
*NL*
together
,
thinking
of
the
goodness
of
God
to
such
sinful
creatures
?
No
;
you
*NL*
are
quarrelling
,
and
tying
up
little
bags
of
roots
to
bury
under
the
*NL*
doorsteps
to
poison
each
other
with
.
God
sees
you
.
You
men
steal
away
to
*NL*
every
grog
shop
to
sell
your
master
's
corn
,
that
you
may
buy
rum
to
drink
.
*NL*
God
sees
you
.
You
sneak
into
the
back
streets
,
or
among
the
bushes
,
to
*NL*
pitch
coppers
.
Although
your
masters
may
not
find
you
out
,
God
sees
you
;
*NL*
and
he
will
punish
you
.
You
must
forsake
your
sinful
ways
,
and
be
faithful
*NL*
servants
.
Obey
your
old
master
and
your
young
master
--
your
old
mistress
and
*NL*
your
young
mistress
.
If
you
disobey
your
earthly
master
,
you
offend
your
*NL*
heavenly
Master
.
You
must
obey
God
's
commandments
.
When
you
go
from
here
,
*NL*
do
n't
stop
at
the
corners
of
the
streets
to
talk
,
but
go
directly
home
,
and
*NL*
let
your
master
and
mistress
see
that
you
have
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
benediction
was
pronounced
.
We
went
home
,
highly
amused
at
brother
*NL*
Pike
's
gospel
teaching
,
and
we
determined
to
hear
him
again
.
I
went
the
*NL*
next
Sabbath
evening
,
and
heard
pretty
much
a
repetition
of
the
last
*NL*
discourse
.
At
the
close
of
the
meeting
,
Mr.
Pike
informed
us
that
he
found
*NL*
it
very
inconvenient
to
meet
at
the
friend
's
house
,
and
he
should
be
glad
*NL*
to
see
us
,
every
Sunday
evening
,
at
his
own
kitchen
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
home
with
the
feeling
that
I
had
heard
the
Reverend
Mr.
Pike
for
the
*NL*
last
time
.
Some
of
his
members
repaired
to
his
house
,
and
found
that
the
*NL*
kitchen
sported
two
tallow
candles
;
the
first
time
,
I
am
sure
,
since
its
*NL*
present
occupant
owned
it
,
for
the
servants
never
had
any
thing
but
pine
*NL*
knots
.
It
was
so
long
before
the
reverend
gentleman
descended
from
his
*NL*
comfortable
parlor
that
the
slaves
left
,
and
went
to
enjoy
a
Methodist
*NL*
shout
.
They
never
seem
so
happy
as
when
shouting
and
singing
at
religious
*NL*
meetings
.
Many
of
them
are
sincere
,
and
nearer
to
the
gate
of
heaven
than
*NL*
sanctimonious
Mr.
Pike
,
and
other
long-faced
Christians
,
who
see
wounded
*NL*
Samaritans
,
and
pass
by
on
the
other
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
slaves
generally
compose
their
own
songs
and
hymns
;
and
they
do
not
*NL*
trouble
their
heads
much
about
the
measure
.
They
often
sing
the
following
*NL*
verses
:
*NL*
*NL*
Old
Satan
is
one
busy
ole
man
;
*NL*
He
rolls
dem
blocks
all
in
my
way
;
*NL*
But
Jesus
is
my
bosom
friend
;
*NL*
He
rolls
dem
blocks
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
I
had
died
when
I
was
young
,
*NL*
Den
how
my
stam
`
ring
tongue
would
have
sung
;
*NL*
But
I
am
ole
,
and
now
I
stand
*NL*
A
narrow
chance
for
to
tread
dat
heavenly
land
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
well
remember
one
occasion
when
I
attended
a
Methodist
class
meeting
.
I
*NL*
went
with
a
burdened
spirit
,
and
happened
to
sit
next
a
poor
,
bereaved
*NL*
mother
,
whose
heart
was
still
heavier
than
mine
.
The
class
leader
was
the
*NL*
town
constable
--
a
man
who
bought
and
sold
slaves
,
who
whipped
his
brethren
*NL*
and
sisters
of
the
church
at
the
public
whipping
post
,
in
jail
or
out
of
*NL*
jail
.
He
was
ready
to
perform
that
Christian
office
any
where
for
fifty
*NL*
cents
.
This
white-faced
,
black-hearted
brother
came
near
us
,
and
said
to
*NL*
the
stricken
woman
,
``
Sister
,
ca
n't
you
tell
us
how
the
Lord
deals
with
your
*NL*
soul
?
Do
you
love
him
as
you
did
formerly
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
rose
to
her
feet
,
and
said
,
in
piteous
tones
,
``
My
Lord
and
Master
,
help
*NL*
me
!
My
load
is
more
than
I
can
bear
.
God
has
hid
himself
from
me
,
and
I
am
*NL*
left
in
darkness
and
misery
.
''
Then
,
striking
her
breast
,
she
continued
,
``
I
*NL*
ca
n't
tell
you
what
is
in
here
!
They
've
got
all
my
children
.
Last
week
they
*NL*
took
the
last
one
.
God
only
knows
where
they
've
sold
her
.
They
let
me
have
*NL*
her
sixteen
years
,
and
then
--
O
!
O
!
Pray
for
her
brothers
and
sisters
!
I
've
*NL*
got
nothing
to
live
for
now
.
God
make
my
time
short
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
down
,
quivering
in
every
limb
.
I
saw
that
constable
class
leader
*NL*
become
crimson
in
the
face
with
suppressed
laughter
,
while
he
held
up
his
*NL*
handkerchief
,
that
those
who
were
weeping
for
the
poor
woman
's
calamity
*NL*
might
not
see
his
merriment
.
Then
,
with
assumed
gravity
,
he
said
to
the
*NL*
bereaved
mother
,
``
Sister
,
pray
to
the
Lord
that
every
dispensation
of
his
*NL*
divine
will
may
be
sanctified
to
the
good
of
your
poor
needy
soul
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
congregation
struck
up
a
hymn
,
and
sung
as
though
they
were
as
free
as
*NL*
the
birds
that
warbled
round
us
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
Ole
Satan
thought
he
had
a
mighty
aim
;
*NL*
He
missed
my
soul
,
and
caught
my
sins
.
*NL*
Cry
Amen
,
cry
Amen
,
cry
Amen
to
God
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
my
sins
upon
his
back
;
*NL*
Went
muttering
and
grumbling
down
to
hell
.
*NL*
Cry
Amen
,
cry
Amen
,
cry
Amen
to
God
!
*NL*
*NL*
Ole
Satan
's
church
is
here
below
.
*NL*
Up
to
God
's
free
church
I
hope
to
go
.
*NL*
Cry
Amen
,
cry
Amen
,
cry
Amen
to
God
!
*NL*
*NL*
Precious
are
such
moments
to
the
poor
slaves
.
If
you
were
to
hear
them
at
*NL*
such
times
,
you
might
think
they
were
happy
.
But
can
that
hour
of
singing
*NL*
and
shouting
sustain
them
through
the
dreary
week
,
toiling
without
wages
,
*NL*
under
constant
dread
of
the
lash
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
Episcopal
clergyman
,
who
,
ever
since
my
earliest
recollection
,
had
been
*NL*
a
sort
of
god
among
the
slaveholders
,
concluded
,
as
his
family
was
large
,
*NL*
that
he
must
go
where
money
was
more
abundant
.
A
very
different
clergyman
*NL*
took
his
place
.
The
change
was
very
agreeable
to
the
colored
people
,
who
*NL*
said
,
``
God
has
sent
us
a
good
man
this
time
.
''
They
loved
him
,
and
their
*NL*
children
followed
him
for
a
smile
or
a
kind
word
.
Even
the
slaveholders
*NL*
felt
his
influence
.
He
brought
to
the
rectory
five
slaves
.
His
wife
taught
*NL*
them
to
read
and
write
,
and
to
be
useful
to
her
and
themselves
.
As
soon
as
*NL*
he
was
settled
,
he
turned
his
attention
to
the
needy
slaves
around
him
.
He
*NL*
urged
upon
his
parishioners
the
duty
of
having
a
meeting
expressly
for
them
*NL*
every
Sunday
,
with
a
sermon
adapted
to
their
comprehension
.
After
much
*NL*
argument
and
importunity
,
it
was
finally
agreed
that
they
might
occupy
the
*NL*
gallery
of
the
church
on
Sunday
evenings
.
Many
colored
people
,
hitherto
*NL*
unaccustomed
to
attend
church
,
now
gladly
went
to
hear
the
gospel
preached
.
*NL*
The
sermons
were
simple
,
and
they
understood
them
.
Moreover
,
it
was
the
*NL*
first
time
they
had
ever
been
addressed
as
human
beings
.
It
was
not
long
*NL*
before
his
white
parishioners
began
to
be
dissatisfied
.
He
was
accused
of
*NL*
preaching
better
sermons
to
the
negroes
than
he
did
to
them
.
He
honestly
*NL*
confessed
that
he
bestowed
more
pains
upon
those
sermons
than
upon
any
*NL*
others
;
for
the
slaves
were
reared
in
such
ignorance
that
it
was
a
*NL*
difficult
task
to
adapt
himself
to
their
comprehension
.
Dissensions
arose
*NL*
in
the
parish
.
Some
wanted
he
should
preach
to
them
in
the
evening
,
and
to
*NL*
the
slaves
in
the
afternoon
.
In
the
midst
of
these
disputings
his
wife
*NL*
died
,
after
a
very
short
illness
.
Her
slaves
gathered
round
her
dying
bed
*NL*
in
great
sorrow
.
She
said
,
``
I
have
tried
to
do
you
good
and
promote
your
*NL*
happiness
;
and
if
I
have
failed
,
it
has
not
been
for
want
of
interest
in
*NL*
your
welfare
.
Do
not
weep
for
me
;
but
prepare
for
the
new
duties
that
lie
*NL*
before
you
.
I
leave
you
all
free
.
May
we
meet
in
a
better
world
.
''
Her
*NL*
liberated
slaves
were
sent
away
,
with
funds
to
establish
them
comfortably
.
*NL*
The
colored
people
will
long
bless
the
memory
of
that
truly
Christian
*NL*
woman
.
Soon
after
her
death
her
husband
preached
his
farewell
sermon
,
and
*NL*
many
tears
were
shed
at
his
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Several
years
after
,
he
passed
through
our
town
and
preached
to
his
former
*NL*
congregation
.
In
his
afternoon
sermon
he
addressed
the
colored
people
.
``
My
*NL*
friends
,
''
said
he
,
``
it
affords
me
great
happiness
to
have
an
opportunity
of
*NL*
speaking
to
you
again
.
For
two
years
I
have
been
striving
to
do
something
*NL*
for
the
colored
people
of
my
own
parish
;
but
nothing
is
yet
accomplished
.
I
*NL*
have
not
even
preached
a
sermon
to
them
.
Try
to
live
according
to
the
word
*NL*
of
God
,
my
friends
.
Your
skin
is
darker
than
mine
;
but
God
judges
men
by
*NL*
their
hearts
,
not
by
the
color
of
their
skins
.
''
This
was
strange
doctrine
*NL*
from
a
southern
pulpit
.
It
was
very
offensive
to
slaveholders
.
They
said
he
*NL*
and
his
wife
had
made
fools
of
their
slaves
,
and
that
he
preached
like
a
*NL*
fool
to
the
negroes
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
knew
an
old
black
man
,
whose
piety
and
childlike
trust
in
God
were
*NL*
beautiful
to
witness
.
At
fifty-three
years
old
he
joined
the
Baptist
*NL*
church
.
He
had
a
most
earnest
desire
to
learn
to
read
.
He
thought
he
should
*NL*
know
how
to
serve
God
better
if
he
could
only
read
the
Bible
.
He
came
to
*NL*
me
,
and
begged
me
to
teach
him
.
He
said
he
could
not
pay
me
,
for
he
had
no
*NL*
money
;
but
he
would
bring
me
nice
fruit
when
the
season
for
it
came
.
I
*NL*
asked
him
if
he
did
n't
know
it
was
contrary
to
law
;
and
that
slaves
were
*NL*
whipped
and
imprisoned
for
teaching
each
other
to
read
.
This
brought
the
*NL*
tears
into
his
eyes
.
``
Do
n't
be
troubled
,
uncle
Fred
,
''
said
I.
``
I
have
no
*NL*
thoughts
of
refusing
to
teach
you
.
I
only
told
you
of
the
law
,
that
you
*NL*
might
know
the
danger
,
and
be
on
your
guard
.
''
He
thought
he
could
plan
to
*NL*
come
three
times
a
week
without
its
being
suspected
.
I
selected
a
quiet
*NL*
nook
,
where
no
intruder
was
likely
to
penetrate
,
and
there
I
taught
him
his
*NL*
A
,
B
,
C.
Considering
his
age
,
his
progress
was
astonishing
.
As
soon
as
he
*NL*
could
spell
in
two
syllables
he
wanted
to
spell
out
words
in
the
Bible
.
The
*NL*
happy
smile
that
illuminated
his
face
put
joy
into
my
heart
.
After
spelling
*NL*
out
a
few
words
,
he
paused
,
and
said
,
``
Honey
,
it
`
pears
when
I
can
read
dis
*NL*
good
book
I
shall
be
nearer
to
God
.
White
man
is
got
all
de
sense
.
He
can
*NL*
larn
easy
.
It
ai
n't
easy
for
ole
black
man
like
me
.
I
only
wants
to
read
*NL*
dis
book
,
dat
I
may
know
how
to
live
;
den
I
hab
no
fear
`
bout
dying
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
tried
to
encourage
him
by
speaking
of
the
rapid
progress
he
had
made
.
*NL*
``
Hab
patience
,
child
,
''
he
replied
.
``
I
larns
slow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
no
need
of
patience
.
His
gratitude
,
and
the
happiness
imparted
,
were
*NL*
more
than
a
recompense
for
all
my
trouble
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
end
of
six
months
he
had
read
through
the
New
Testament
,
and
could
*NL*
find
any
text
in
it
.
One
day
,
when
he
had
recited
unusually
well
,
I
said
,
*NL*
``
Uncle
Fred
,
how
do
you
manage
to
get
your
lessons
so
well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
bress
you
,
chile
,
''
he
replied
.
``
You
nebber
gibs
me
a
lesson
dat
I
*NL*
do
n't
pray
to
God
to
help
me
to
understan

what
I
spells
and
what
I
reads
.
*NL*
And
he
_
does
_
help
me
,
chile
.
Bress
his
holy
name
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
thousands
,
who
,
like
good
uncle
Fred
,
are
thirsting
for
the
water
*NL*
of
life
;
but
the
law
forbids
it
,
and
the
churches
withhold
it
.
They
send
*NL*
the
Bible
to
heathen
abroad
,
and
neglect
the
heathen
at
home
.
I
am
glad
*NL*
that
missionaries
go
out
to
the
dark
corners
of
the
earth
;
but
I
ask
them
*NL*
not
to
overlook
the
dark
corners
at
home
.
Talk
to
American
slaveholders
as
*NL*
you
talk
to
savages
in
Africa
.
Tell
_
them
_
it
was
wrong
to
traffic
in
men
.
*NL*
Tell
them
it
is
sinful
to
sell
their
own
children
,
and
atrocious
to
violate
*NL*
their
own
daughters
.
Tell
them
that
all
men
are
brethren
,
and
that
man
has
*NL*
no
right
to
shut
out
the
light
of
knowledge
from
his
brother
.
Tell
them
*NL*
they
are
answerable
to
God
for
sealing
up
the
Fountain
of
Life
from
souls
*NL*
that
are
thirsting
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
men
who
would
gladly
undertake
such
missionary
work
as
this
;
but
,
*NL*
alas
!
their
number
is
small
.
They
are
hated
by
the
south
,
and
would
be
*NL*
driven
from
its
soil
,
or
dragged
to
prison
to
die
,
as
others
have
been
*NL*
before
them
.
The
field
is
ripe
for
the
harvest
,
and
awaits
the
reapers
.
*NL*
Perhaps
the
great
grandchildren
of
uncle
Fred
may
have
freely
imparted
to
*NL*
them
the
divine
treasures
,
which
he
sought
by
stealth
,
at
the
risk
of
the
*NL*
prison
and
the
scourge
.
*NL*
*NL*
Are
doctors
of
divinity
blind
,
or
are
they
hypocrites
?
I
suppose
some
are
*NL*
the
one
,
and
some
the
other
;
but
I
think
if
they
felt
the
interest
in
the
*NL*
poor
and
the
lowly
,
that
they
ought
to
feel
,
they
would
not
be
so
_
easily
_
*NL*
blinded
.
A
clergyman
who
goes
to
the
south
,
for
the
first
time
,
has
usually
*NL*
some
feeling
,
however
vague
,
that
slavery
is
wrong
.
The
slaveholder
*NL*
suspects
this
,
and
plays
his
game
accordingly
.
He
makes
himself
as
*NL*
agreeable
as
possible
;
talks
on
theology
,
and
other
kindred
topics
.
The
*NL*
reverend
gentleman
is
asked
to
invoke
a
blessing
on
a
table
loaded
with
*NL*
luxuries
.
After
dinner
he
walks
round
the
premises
,
and
sees
the
beautiful
*NL*
groves
and
flowering
vines
,
and
the
comfortable
huts
of
favored
household
*NL*
slaves
.
The
southerner
invites
him
to
talk
with
those
slaves
.
He
asks
them
*NL*
if
they
want
to
be
free
,
and
they
say
,
``
O
,
no
,
massa
.
''
This
is
sufficient
*NL*
to
satisfy
him
.
He
comes
home
to
publish
a
``
South
Side
View
of
Slavery
,
''
*NL*
and
to
complain
of
the
exaggerations
of
abolitionists
.
He
assures
people
*NL*
that
he
has
been
to
the
south
,
and
seen
slavery
for
himself
;
that
it
is
a
*NL*
beautiful
``
patriarchal
institution
;
''
that
the
slaves
do
n't
want
their
*NL*
freedom
;
that
they
have
hallelujah
meetings
and
other
religious
privileges
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
does
_
he
_
know
of
the
half-starved
wretches
toiling
from
dawn
till
*NL*
dark
on
the
plantations
?
of
mothers
shrieking
for
their
children
,
torn
from
*NL*
their
arms
by
slave
traders
?
of
young
girls
dragged
down
into
moral
filth
?
*NL*
of
pools
of
blood
around
the
whipping
post
?
of
hounds
trained
to
tear
human
*NL*
flesh
?
of
men
screwed
into
cotton
gins
to
die
?
The
slaveholder
showed
him
*NL*
none
of
these
things
,
and
the
slaves
dared
not
tell
of
them
if
he
had
asked
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
a
great
difference
between
Christianity
and
religion
at
the
south
.
*NL*
If
a
man
goes
to
the
communion
table
,
and
pays
money
into
the
treasury
of
*NL*
the
church
,
no
matter
if
it
be
the
price
of
blood
,
he
is
called
religious
.
*NL*
If
a
pastor
has
offspring
by
a
woman
not
his
wife
,
the
church
dismiss
him
,
*NL*
if
she
is
a
white
woman
;
but
if
she
is
colored
,
it
does
not
hinder
his
*NL*
continuing
to
be
their
good
shepherd
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
was
told
that
Dr.
Flint
had
joined
the
Episcopal
church
,
I
was
much
*NL*
surprised
.
I
supposed
that
religion
had
a
purifying
effect
on
the
character
*NL*
of
men
;
but
the
worst
persecutions
I
endured
from
him
were
after
he
was
a
*NL*
communicant
.
The
conversation
of
the
doctor
,
the
day
after
he
had
been
*NL*
confirmed
,
certainly
gave
_
me
_
no
indication
that
he
had
``
renounced
the
*NL*
devil
and
all
his
works
.
''
In
answer
to
some
of
his
usual
talk
,
I
reminded
*NL*
him
that
he
had
just
joined
the
church
.
``
Yes
,
Linda
,
''
said
he
.
``
It
was
*NL*
proper
for
me
to
do
so
.
I
am
getting
in
years
,
and
my
position
in
society
*NL*
requires
it
,
and
it
puts
an
end
to
all
the
damned
slang
.
You
would
do
well
*NL*
to
join
the
church
,
too
,
Linda
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
sinners
enough
in
it
already
,
''
rejoined
I.
``
If
I
could
be
*NL*
allowed
to
live
like
a
Christian
,
I
should
be
glad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
do
what
I
require
;
and
if
you
are
faithful
to
me
,
you
will
be
as
*NL*
virtuous
as
my
wife
,
''
he
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
answered
that
the
Bible
did
n't
say
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
voice
became
hoarse
with
rage
.
``
How
dare
you
preach
to
me
about
your
*NL*
infernal
Bible
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
``
What
right
have
you
,
who
are
my
negro
,
to
*NL*
talk
to
me
about
what
you
would
like
and
what
you
would
n't
like
?
I
am
your
*NL*
master
,
and
you
shall
obey
me
.

*NL*
*NL*
No
wonder
the
slaves
sing
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
Ole
Satan
's
church
is
here
below

Up

Another
Link
To
Life
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
not
returned
to
my
master
's
house
since
the
birth
of
my
child
.
The
*NL*
old
man
raved
to
have
me
thus
removed
from
his
immediate
power
;
but
his
*NL*
wife
vowed
,
by
all
that
was
good
and
great
,
she
would
kill
me
if
I
came
*NL*
back
;
and
he
did
not
doubt
her
word
.
Sometimes
he
would
stay
away
for
a
*NL*
season
.
Then
he
would
come
and
renew
the
old
threadbare
discourse
about
his
*NL*
forbearance
and
my
ingratitude
.
He
labored
,
most
unnecessarily
,
to
convince
*NL*
me
that
I
had
lowered
myself
.
The
venomous
old
reprobate
had
no
need
of
*NL*
descanting
on
that
theme
.
I
felt
humiliated
enough
.
My
unconscious
babe
was
*NL*
the
ever-present
witness
of
my
shame
.
I
listened
with
silent
contempt
when
*NL*
he
talked
about
my
having
forfeited
_
his
_
good
opinion
;
but
I
shed
bitter
*NL*
tears
that
I
was
no
longer
worthy
of
being
respected
by
the
good
and
pure
.
*NL*
Alas
!
slavery
still
held
me
in
its
poisonous
grasp
.
There
was
no
chance
for
*NL*
me
to
be
respectable
.
There
was
no
prospect
of
being
able
to
lead
a
better
*NL*
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
,
when
my
master
found
that
I
still
refused
to
accept
what
he
*NL*
called
his
kind
offers
,
he
would
threaten
to
sell
my
child
.
``
Perhaps
that
*NL*
will
humble
you
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Humble
_
me
_
!
Was
I
not
already
in
the
dust
?
But
his
threat
lacerated
my
*NL*
heart
.
I
knew
the
law
gave
him
power
to
fulfil
it
;
for
slaveholders
have
*NL*
been
cunning
enough
to
enact
that
``
the
child
shall
follow
the
condition
of
*NL*
the
_
mother
_
,
''
not
of
the
_
father
_
,
thus
taking
care
that
licentiousness
*NL*
shall
not
interfere
with
avarice
.
This
reflection
made
me
clasp
my
innocent
*NL*
babe
all
the
more
firmly
to
my
heart
.
Horrid
visions
passed
through
my
mind
*NL*
when
I
thought
of
his
liability
to
fall
into
the
slave
trader
's
hands
.
I
*NL*
wept
over
him
,
and
said
,
``
O
my
child
!
perhaps
they
will
leave
you
in
some
*NL*
cold
cabin
to
die
,
and
then
throw
you
into
a
hole
,
as
if
you
were
a
dog
.
''

When
Dr.
Flint
learned
that
I
was
again
to
be
a
mother
,
he
was
exasperated
*NL*
beyond
measure
.
He
rushed
from
the
house
,
and
returned
with
a
pair
of
*NL*
shears
.
I
had
a
fine
head
of
hair
;
and
he
often
railed
about
my
pride
of
*NL*
arranging
it
nicely
.
He
cut
every
hair
close
to
my
head
,
storming
and
*NL*
swearing
all
the
time
.
I
replied
to
some
of
his
abuse
,
and
he
struck
me
.
*NL*
Some
months
before
,
he
had
pitched
me
down
stairs
in
a
fit
of
passion
;
and
*NL*
the
injury
I
received
was
so
serious
that
I
was
unable
to
turn
myself
in
*NL*
bed
for
many
days
.
He
then
said
,
``
Linda
,
I
swear
by
God
I
will
never
raise
*NL*
my
hand
against
you
again
;
''
but
I
knew
that
he
would
forget
his
promise
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
he
discovered
my
situation
,
he
was
like
a
restless
spirit
from
the
*NL*
pit
.
He
came
every
day
;
and
I
was
subjected
to
such
insults
as
no
pen
can
*NL*
describe
.
I
would
not
describe
them
if
I
could
;
they
were
too
low
,
too
*NL*
revolting
.
I
tried
to
keep
them
from
my
grandmother
's
knowledge
as
much
as
*NL*
I
could
.
I
knew
she
had
enough
to
sadden
her
life
,
without
having
my
*NL*
troubles
to
bear
.
When
she
saw
the
doctor
treat
me
with
violence
,
and
heard
*NL*
him
utter
oaths
terrible
enough
to
palsy
a
man
's
tongue
,
she
could
not
*NL*
always
hold
her
peace
.
It
was
natural
and
motherlike
that
she
should
try
to
*NL*
defend
me
;
but
it
only
made
matters
worse
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
told
me
my
new-born
babe
was
a
girl
,
my
heart
was
heavier
than
it
*NL*
had
ever
been
before
.
Slavery
is
terrible
for
men
;
but
it
is
far
more
*NL*
terrible
for
women
.
Superadded
to
the
burden
common
to
all
,
_
they
_
have
*NL*
wrongs
,
and
sufferings
,
and
mortifications
peculiarly
their
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Flint
had
sworn
that
he
would
make
me
suffer
,
to
my
last
day
,
for
this
*NL*
new
crime
against
_
him
_
,
as
he
called
it
;
and
as
long
as
he
had
me
in
his
*NL*
power
he
kept
his
word
.
On
the
fourth
day
after
the
birth
of
my
babe
,
he
*NL*
entered
my
room
suddenly
,
and
commanded
me
to
rise
and
bring
my
baby
to
*NL*
him
.
The
nurse
who
took
care
of
me
had
gone
out
of
the
room
to
prepare
some
*NL*
nourishment
,
and
I
was
alone
.
There
was
no
alternative
.
I
rose
,
took
up
my
*NL*
babe
,
and
crossed
the
room
to
where
he
sat
.
``
Now
stand
there
,
''
said
he
,
*NL*
``
till
I
tell
you
to
go
back
!
''
My
child
bore
a
strong
resemblance
to
her
*NL*
father
,
and
to
the
deceased
Mrs.
Sands
,
her
grandmother
.
He
noticed
this
;
*NL*
and
while
I
stood
before
him
,
trembling
with
weakness
,
he
heaped
upon
me
*NL*
and
my
little
one
every
vile
epithet
he
could
think
of
.
Even
the
*NL*
grandmother
in
her
grave
did
not
escape
his
curses
.
In
the
midst
of
his
*NL*
vituperations
I
fainted
at
his
feet
.
This
recalled
him
to
his
senses
.
He
*NL*
took
the
baby
from
my
arms
,
laid
it
on
the
bed
,
dashed
cold
water
in
my
*NL*
face
,
took
me
up
,
and
shook
me
violently
,
to
restore
my
consciousness
*NL*
before
any
one
entered
the
room
.
Just
then
my
grandmother
came
in
,
and
he
*NL*
hurried
out
of
the
house
.
I
suffered
in
consequence
of
this
treatment
;
but
*NL*
I
begged
my
friends
to
let
me
die
,
rather
than
send
for
the
doctor
.
There
*NL*
was
nothing
I
dreaded
so
much
as
his
presence
.
My
life
was
spared
;
and
I
*NL*
was
glad
for
the
sake
of
my
little
ones
.
Had
it
not
been
for
these
ties
to
*NL*
life
,
I
should
have
been
glad
to
be
released
by
death
,
though
I
had
lived
*NL*
only
nineteen
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
Always
it
gave
me
a
pang
that
my
children
had
no
lawful
claim
to
a
name
.
*NL*
Their
father
offered
his
;
but
,
if
I
had
wished
to
accept
the
offer
,
I
dared
*NL*
not
while
my
master
lived
.
Moreover
,
I
knew
it
would
not
be
accepted
at
*NL*
their
baptism
.
A
Christian
name
they
were
at
least
entitled
to
;
and
we
*NL*
resolved
to
call
my
boy
for
our
dear
good
Benjamin
,
who
had
gone
far
away
*NL*
from
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
grandmother
belonged
to
the
church
;
and
she
was
very
desirous
of
having
*NL*
the
children
christened
.
I
knew
Dr.
Flint
would
forbid
it
,
and
I
did
not
*NL*
venture
to
attempt
it
.
But
chance
favored
me
.
He
was
called
to
visit
a
*NL*
patient
out
of
town
,
and
was
obliged
to
be
absent
during
Sunday
.
``
Now
is
*NL*
the
time
,
''
said
my
grandmother
;
``
we
will
take
the
children
to
church
,
and
*NL*
have
them
christened
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
entered
the
church
,
recollections
of
my
mother
came
over
me
,
and
I
*NL*
felt
subdued
in
spirit
.
There
she
had
presented
me
for
baptism
,
without
any
*NL*
reason
to
feel
ashamed
.
She
had
been
married
,
and
had
such
legal
rights
as
*NL*
slavery
allows
to
a
slave
.
The
vows
had
at
least
been
sacred
to
_
her
_
,
and
*NL*
she
had
never
violated
them
.
I
was
glad
she
was
not
alive
,
to
know
under
*NL*
what
different
circumstances
her
grandchildren
were
presented
for
baptism
.
*NL*
Why
had
my
lot
been
so
different
from
my
mother
's
?
_
Her
_
master
had
died
*NL*
when
she
was
a
child
;
and
she
remained
with
her
mistress
till
she
married
.
*NL*
She
was
never
in
the
power
of
any
master
;
and
thus
she
escaped
one
class
of
*NL*
the
evils
that
generally
fall
upon
slaves
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
my
baby
was
about
to
be
christened
,
the
former
mistress
of
my
father
*NL*
stepped
up
to
me
,
and
proposed
to
give
it
her
Christian
name
.
To
this
I
*NL*
added
the
surname
of
my
father
,
who
had
himself
no
legal
right
to
it
;
for
*NL*
my
grandfather
on
the
paternal
side
was
a
white
gentleman
.
What
tangled
*NL*
skeins
are
the
genealogies
of
slavery
!
I
loved
my
father
;
but
it
mortified
*NL*
me
to
be
obliged
to
bestow
his
name
on
my
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
left
the
church
,
my
father
's
old
mistress
invited
me
to
go
home
*NL*
with
her
.
She
clasped
a
gold
chain
round
my
baby
's
neck
.
I
thanked
her
for
*NL*
this
kindness
;
but
I
did
not
like
the
emblem
.
I
wanted
no
chain
to
be
*NL*
fastened
on
my
daughter
,
not
even
if
its
links
were
of
gold
.
How
earnestly
*NL*
I
prayed
that
she
might
never
feel
the
weight
of
slavery
's
chain
,
whose
*NL*
iron
entereth
into
the
soul
!

Continued
Persecutions
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
My
children
grew
finely
;
and
Dr.
Flint
would
often
say
to
me
,
with
an
*NL*
exulting
smile
.
``
These
brats
will
bring
me
a
handsome
sum
of
money
one
of
*NL*
these
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
to
myself
that
,
God
being
my
helper
,
they
should
never
pass
into
*NL*
his
hands
.
It
seemed
to
me
I
would
rather
see
them
killed
than
have
them
*NL*
given
up
to
his
power
.
The
money
for
the
freedom
of
myself
and
my
children
*NL*
could
be
obtained
;
but
I
derived
no
advantage
from
that
circumstance
.
Dr.
*NL*
Flint
loved
money
,
but
he
loved
power
more
.
After
much
discussion
,
my
*NL*
friends
resolved
on
making
another
trial
.
There
was
a
slaveholder
about
to
*NL*
leave
for
Texas
,
and
he
was
commissioned
to
buy
me
.
He
was
to
begin
with
*NL*
nine
hundred
dollars
,
and
go
up
to
twelve
.
My
master
refused
his
offers
.
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
said
he
,
``
she
do
n't
belong
to
me
.
She
is
my
daughter
's
property
,
and
*NL*
I
have
no
right
to
sell
her
.
I
mistrust
that
you
come
from
her
paramour
.
If
*NL*
so
,
you
may
tell
him
that
he
can
not
buy
her
for
any
money
;
neither
can
he
*NL*
buy
her
children
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
came
to
see
me
the
next
day
,
and
my
heart
beat
quicker
as
he
*NL*
entered
.
I
never
had
seen
the
old
man
tread
with
so
majestic
a
step
.
He
*NL*
seated
himself
and
looked
at
me
with
withering
scorn
.
My
children
had
*NL*
learned
to
be
afraid
of
him
.
The
little
one
would
shut
her
eyes
and
hide
*NL*
her
face
on
my
shoulder
whenever
she
saw
him
;
and
Benny
,
who
was
now
nearly
*NL*
five
years
old
,
often
inquired
,
``
What
makes
that
bad
man
come
here
so
many
*NL*
times
?
Does
he
want
to
hurt
us
?
''
I
would
clasp
the
dear
boy
in
my
arms
,
*NL*
trusting
that
he
would
be
free
before
he
was
old
enough
to
solve
the
*NL*
problem
.
And
now
,
as
the
doctor
sat
there
so
grim
and
silent
,
the
child
*NL*
left
his
play
and
came
and
nestled
up
by
me
.
At
last
my
tormentor
spoke
.
*NL*
``
So
you
are
left
in
disgust
,
are
you
?
''
said
he
.
``
It
is
no
more
than
I
*NL*
expected
.
You
remember
I
told
you
years
ago
that
you
would
be
treated
so
.
*NL*
So
he
is
tired
of
you
?
Ha
!
ha
!
ha
!
The
virtuous
madam
do
n't
like
to
hear
*NL*
about
it
,
does
she
?
Ha
!
ha
!
ha
!
''
There
was
a
sting
in
his
calling
me
*NL*
virtuous
madam
.
I
no
longer
had
the
power
of
answering
him
as
I
had
*NL*
formerly
done
.
He
continued
:
``
So
it
seems
you
are
trying
to
get
up
another
*NL*
intrigue
.
Your
new
paramour
came
to
me
,
and
offered
to
buy
you
;
but
you
may
*NL*
be
assured
you
will
not
succeed
.
You
are
mine
;
and
you
shall
be
mine
for
*NL*
life
.
There
lives
no
human
being
that
can
take
you
out
of
slavery
.
I
would
*NL*
have
done
it
;
but
you
rejected
my
kind
offer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
I
did
not
wish
to
get
up
any
intrigue
;
that
I
had
never
seen
the
*NL*
man
who
offered
to
buy
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
tell
me
I
lie
?
''
exclaimed
he
,
dragging
me
from
my
chair
.
``
Will
you
*NL*
say
again
that
you
never
saw
that
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
answered
,
``
I
do
say
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
clinched
my
arm
with
a
volley
of
oaths
.
Ben
began
to
scream
,
and
I
told
*NL*
him
to
go
to
his
grandmother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
stir
a
step
,
you
little
wretch
!
''
said
he
.
The
child
drew
nearer
*NL*
to
me
,
and
put
his
arms
round
me
,
as
if
he
wanted
to
protect
me
.
This
was
*NL*
too
much
for
my
enraged
master
.
He
caught
him
up
and
hurled
him
across
the
*NL*
room
.
I
thought
he
was
dead
,
and
rushed
towards
him
to
take
him
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
yet
!
''
exclaimed
the
doctor
.
``
Let
him
lie
there
till
he
comes
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
go
!
Let
me
go
!
''
I
screamed
,
``
or
I
will
raise
the
whole
house
.
''
I
*NL*
struggled
and
got
away
;
but
he
clinched
me
again
.
Somebody
opened
the
door
,
*NL*
and
he
released
me
.
I
picked
up
my
insensible
child
,
and
when
I
turned
my
*NL*
tormentor
was
gone
.
Anxiously
,
I
bent
over
the
little
form
,
so
pale
and
*NL*
still
;
and
when
the
brown
eyes
at
last
opened
,
I
do
n't
know
whether
I
was
*NL*
very
happy
.
All
the
doctor
's
former
persecutions
were
renewed
.
He
came
*NL*
morning
,
noon
,
and
night
.
No
jealous
lover
ever
watched
a
rival
more
*NL*
closely
than
he
watched
me
and
the
unknown
slaveholder
,
with
whom
he
*NL*
accused
me
of
wishing
to
get
up
an
intrigue
.
When
my
grandmother
was
out
of
*NL*
the
way
he
searched
every
room
to
find
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
one
of
his
visits
,
he
happened
to
find
a
young
girl
,
whom
he
had
sold
to
*NL*
a
trader
a
few
days
previous
.
His
statement
was
,
that
he
sold
her
because
*NL*
she
had
been
too
familiar
with
the
overseer
.
She
had
had
a
bitter
life
with
*NL*
him
,
and
was
glad
to
be
sold
.
She
had
no
mother
,
and
no
near
ties
.
She
had
*NL*
been
torn
from
all
her
family
years
before
.
A
few
friends
had
entered
into
*NL*
bonds
for
her
safety
,
if
the
trader
would
allow
her
to
spend
with
them
the
*NL*
time
that
intervened
between
her
sale
and
the
gathering
up
of
his
human
*NL*
stock
.
Such
a
favor
was
rarely
granted
.
It
saved
the
trader
the
expense
of
*NL*
board
and
jail
fees
,
and
though
the
amount
was
small
,
it
was
a
weighty
*NL*
consideration
in
a
slavetrader
's
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Flint
always
had
an
aversion
to
meeting
slaves
after
he
had
sold
them
.
*NL*
He
ordered
Rose
out
of
the
house
;
but
he
was
no
longer
her
master
,
and
she
*NL*
took
no
notice
of
him
.
For
once
the
crushed
Rose
was
the
conqueror
.
His
*NL*
gray
eyes
flashed
angrily
upon
her
;
but
that
was
the
extent
of
his
power
.
*NL*
``
How
came
this
girl
here
?
''
he
exclaimed
.
``
What
right
had
you
to
allow
it
,
*NL*
when
you
knew
I
had
sold
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
answered
,
``
This
is
my
grandmother
's
house
,
and
Rose
came
to
see
her
.
I
*NL*
have
no
right
to
turn
any
body
out
of
doors
,
that
comes
here
for
honest
*NL*
purposes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
gave
me
the
blow
that
would
have
fallen
upon
Rose
if
she
had
still
been
*NL*
his
slave
.
My
grandmother
's
attention
had
been
attracted
by
loud
voices
,
*NL*
and
she
entered
in
time
to
see
a
second
blow
dealt
.
She
was
not
a
woman
to
*NL*
let
such
an
outrage
,
in
her
own
house
,
go
unrebuked
.
The
doctor
undertook
*NL*
to
explain
that
I
had
been
insolent
.
Her
indignant
feelings
rose
higher
and
*NL*
higher
,
and
finally
boiled
over
in
words
.
``
Get
out
of
my
house
!
''
she
*NL*
exclaimed
.
``
Go
home
,
and
take
care
of
your
wife
and
children
,
and
you
will
*NL*
have
enough
to
do
,
without
watching
my
family
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
threw
the
birth
of
my
children
in
her
face
,
and
accused
her
of
*NL*
sanctioning
the
life
I
was
leading
.
She
told
him
I
was
living
with
her
by
*NL*
compulsion
of
his
wife
;
that
he
need
n't
accuse
her
,
for
he
was
the
one
to
*NL*
blame
;
he
was
the
one
who
had
caused
all
the
trouble
.
She
grew
more
and
*NL*
more
excited
as
she
went
on
.
``
I
tell
you
what
,
Dr.
Flint
,
''
said
she
,
``
you
*NL*
ai
n't
got
many
more
years
to
live
,
and
you
'd
better
be
saying
your
prayers
.
*NL*
It
will
take
'em
all
,
and
more
too
,
to
wash
the
dirt
off
your
soul
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
whom
you
are
talking
to
?
''
he
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
replied
,
``
Yes
,
I
know
very
well
who
I
am
talking
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
left
the
house
in
a
great
rage
.
I
looked
at
my
grandmother
.
Our
eyes
*NL*
met
.
Their
angry
expression
had
passed
away
,
but
she
looked
sorrowful
and
*NL*
weary
--
weary
of
incessant
strife
.
I
wondered
that
it
did
not
lessen
her
*NL*
love
for
me
;
but
if
it
did
she
never
showed
it
.
She
was
always
kind
,
always
*NL*
ready
to
sympathize
with
my
troubles
.
There
might
have
been
peace
and
*NL*
contentment
in
that
humble
home
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
demon
Slavery
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
winter
passed
undisturbed
by
the
doctor
.
The
beautiful
spring
came
;
and
*NL*
when
Nature
resumes
her
loveliness
,
the
human
soul
is
apt
to
revive
also
.
*NL*
My
drooping
hopes
came
to
life
again
with
the
flowers
.
I
was
dreaming
of
*NL*
freedom
again
;
more
for
my
children
's
sake
than
my
own
.
I
planned
and
I
*NL*
planned
.
Obstacles
hit
against
plans
.
There
seemed
no
way
of
overcoming
*NL*
them
;
and
yet
I
hoped
.
*NL*
*NL*
Back
came
the
wily
doctor
.
I
was
not
at
home
when
he
called
.
A
friend
had
*NL*
invited
me
to
a
small
party
,
and
to
gratify
her
I
went
.
To
my
great
*NL*
consternation
,
a
messenger
came
in
haste
to
say
that
Dr.
Flint
was
at
my
*NL*
grandmother
's
,
and
insisted
on
seeing
me
.
They
did
not
tell
him
where
I
*NL*
was
,
or
he
would
have
come
and
raised
a
disturbance
in
my
friend
's
house
.
*NL*
They
sent
me
a
dark
wrapper
,
I
threw
it
on
and
hurried
home
.
My
speed
did
*NL*
not
save
me
;
the
doctor
had
gone
away
in
anger
.
I
dreaded
the
morning
,
but
*NL*
I
could
not
delay
it
;
it
came
,
warm
and
bright
.
At
an
early
hour
the
doctor
*NL*
came
and
asked
me
where
I
had
been
last
night
.
I
told
him
.
He
did
not
*NL*
believe
me
,
and
sent
to
my
friend
's
house
to
ascertain
the
facts
.
He
came
*NL*
in
the
afternoon
to
assure
me
he
was
satisfied
that
I
had
spoken
the
truth
.
*NL*
He
seemed
to
be
in
a
facetious
mood
,
and
I
expected
some
jeers
were
coming
.
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
need
some
recreation
,
''
said
he
,
``
but
I
am
surprised
at
your
*NL*
being
there
,
among
those
negroes
.
It
was
not
the
place
for
_
you
_
.
Are
you
*NL*
_
allowed
_
to
visit
such
people
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
understood
this
covert
fling
at
the
white
gentleman
who
was
my
friend
;
*NL*
but
I
merely
replied
,
``
I
went
to
visit
my
friends
,
and
any
company
they
*NL*
keep
is
good
enough
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
on
to
say
,
``
I
have
seen
very
little
of
you
of
late
,
but
my
interest
*NL*
in
you
is
unchanged
.
When
I
said
I
would
have
no
more
mercy
on
you
I
was
*NL*
rash
.
I
recall
my
words
.
Linda
,
you
desire
freedom
for
yourself
and
your
*NL*
children
,
and
you
can
obtain
it
only
through
me
.
If
you
agree
to
what
I
am
*NL*
about
to
propose
,
you
and
they
shall
be
free
.
There
must
be
no
*NL*
communication
of
any
kind
between
you
and
their
father
.
I
will
procure
a
*NL*
cottage
,
where
you
and
the
children
can
live
together
.
Your
labor
shall
be
*NL*
light
,
such
as
sewing
for
my
family
.
Think
what
is
offered
you
,
Linda
--
a
*NL*
home
and
freedom
!
Let
the
past
be
forgotten
.
If
I
have
been
harsh
with
you
*NL*
at
times
,
your
willfulness
drove
me
to
it
.
You
know
I
exact
obedience
from
*NL*
my
own
children
,
and
I
consider
you
as
yet
a
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
for
an
answer
,
but
I
remained
silent
.
``
Why
do
n't
you
speak
?
''
*NL*
said
he
.
``
What
more
do
you
wait
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
accept
my
offer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
anger
was
ready
to
break
loose
;
but
he
succeeded
in
curbing
it
,
and
*NL*
replied
,
``
You
have
answered
without
thought
.
But
I
must
let
you
know
there
*NL*
are
two
sides
to
my
proposition
;
if
you
reject
the
bright
side
,
you
will
be
*NL*
obliged
to
take
the
dark
one
.
You
must
either
accept
my
offer
,
or
you
and
*NL*
your
children
shall
be
sent
to
your
young
master
's
plantation
,
there
to
*NL*
remain
till
your
young
mistress
is
married
;
and
your
children
shall
fare
*NL*
like
the
rest
of
the
negro
children
.
I
give
you
a
week
to
consider
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
shrewd
;
but
I
knew
he
was
not
to
be
trusted
.
I
told
him
I
was
ready
*NL*
to
give
my
answer
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not
receive
it
now
,
''
he
replied
.
``
You
act
too
much
from
impulse
.
*NL*
Remember
that
you
and
your
children
can
be
free
a
week
from
to-day
if
you
*NL*
choose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
what
a
monstrous
chance
hung
the
destiny
of
my
children
!
I
knew
that
my
*NL*
master
's
offer
was
a
snare
,
and
that
if
I
entered
it
escape
would
be
*NL*
impossible
.
As
for
his
promise
,
I
knew
him
so
well
that
I
was
sure
if
he
*NL*
gave
me
free
papers
,
they
would
be
so
managed
as
to
have
no
legal
value
.
*NL*
The
alternative
was
inevitable
.
I
resolved
to
go
to
the
plantation
.
But
*NL*
then
I
thought
how
completely
I
should
be
in
his
power
,
and
the
prospect
*NL*
was
appalling
.
Even
if
I
should
kneel
before
him
,
and
implore
him
to
spare
*NL*
me
,
for
the
sake
of
my
children
,
I
knew
he
would
spurn
me
with
his
foot
,
*NL*
and
my
weakness
would
be
his
triumph
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
the
week
expired
,
I
heard
that
young
Mr.
Flint
was
about
to
be
*NL*
married
to
a
lady
of
his
own
stamp
.
I
foresaw
the
position
I
should
occupy
*NL*
in
his
establishment
.
I
had
once
been
sent
to
the
plantation
for
*NL*
punishment
,
and
fear
of
the
son
had
induced
the
father
to
recall
me
very
*NL*
soon
.
My
mind
was
made
up
;
I
was
resolved
that
I
would
foil
my
master
and
*NL*
save
my
children
,
or
I
would
perish
in
the
attempt
.
I
kept
my
plans
to
*NL*
myself
;
I
knew
that
friends
would
try
to
dissuade
me
from
them
,
and
I
would
*NL*
not
wound
their
feelings
by
rejecting
their
advice
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
decisive
day
the
doctor
came
,
and
said
he
hoped
I
had
made
a
wise
*NL*
choice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
ready
to
go
to
the
plantation
,
sir
,
''
I
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
thought
how
important
your
decision
is
to
your
children
?
''
said
*NL*
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
I
had
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
.
Go
to
the
plantation
,
and
my
curse
go
with
you
,
''
he
replied
.
*NL*
``
Your
boy
shall
be
put
to
work
,
and
he
shall
soon
be
sold
;
and
your
girl
*NL*
shall
be
raised
for
the
purpose
of
selling
well
.
Go
your
own
ways
!
''
He
left
*NL*
the
room
with
curses
,
not
to
be
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
,
my
grandmother
came
and
said
,
``
Linda
,
child
,
*NL*
what
did
you
tell
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
answered
that
I
was
going
to
the
plantation
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Must
_
you
go
?
''
said
she
.
``
Ca
n't
something
be
done
to
stop
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
her
it
was
useless
to
try
;
but
she
begged
me
not
to
give
up
.
She
*NL*
said
she
would
go
to
the
doctor
,
and
remind
him
how
long
and
how
faithfully
*NL*
she
had
served
in
the
family
,
and
how
she
had
taken
her
own
baby
from
her
*NL*
breast
to
nourish
his
wife
.
She
would
tell
him
I
had
been
out
of
the
family
*NL*
so
long
they
would
not
miss
me
;
that
she
would
pay
them
for
my
time
,
and
*NL*
the
money
would
procure
a
woman
who
had
more
strength
for
the
situation
*NL*
than
I
had
.
I
begged
her
not
to
go
;
but
she
persisted
in
saying
,
``
He
will
*NL*
listen
to
_
me
_
,
Linda
.
''
She
went
,
and
was
treated
as
I
expected
.
He
coolly
*NL*
listened
to
what
she
said
,
but
denied
her
request
.
He
told
her
that
what
he
*NL*
did
was
for
my
good
,
that
my
feelings
were
entirely
above
my
situation
,
and
*NL*
that
on
the
plantation
I
would
receive
treatment
that
was
suitable
to
my
*NL*
behavior
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
grandmother
was
much
cast
down
.
I
had
my
secret
hopes
;
but
I
must
fight
*NL*
my
battle
alone
.
I
had
a
woman
's
pride
,
and
a
mother
's
love
for
my
*NL*
children
;
and
I
resolved
that
out
of
the
darkness
of
this
hour
a
brighter
*NL*
dawn
should
rise
for
them
.
My
master
had
power
and
law
on
his
side
;
I
had
a
*NL*
determined
will
.
There
is
might
in
each
.

Scenes
At
The
Plantation
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Early
the
next
morning
I
left
my
grandmother
's
with
my
youngest
child
.
My
*NL*
boy
was
ill
,
and
I
left
him
behind
.
I
had
many
sad
thoughts
as
the
old
*NL*
wagon
jolted
on
.
Hitherto
,
I
had
suffered
alone
;
now
,
my
little
one
was
to
*NL*
be
treated
as
a
slave
.
As
we
drew
near
the
great
house
,
I
thought
of
the
*NL*
time
when
I
was
formerly
sent
there
out
of
revenge
.
I
wondered
for
what
*NL*
purpose
I
was
now
sent
.
I
could
not
tell
.
I
resolved
to
obey
orders
so
far
*NL*
as
duty
required
;
but
within
myself
,
I
determined
to
make
my
stay
as
short
*NL*
as
possible
.
Mr.
Flint
was
waiting
to
receive
us
,
and
told
me
to
follow
him
*NL*
up
stairs
to
receive
orders
for
the
day
.
My
little
Ellen
was
left
below
in
*NL*
the
kitchen
.
It
was
a
change
for
her
,
who
had
always
been
so
carefully
*NL*
tended
.
My
young
master
said
she
might
amuse
herself
in
the
yard
.
This
was
*NL*
kind
of
him
,
since
the
child
was
hateful
to
his
sight
.
My
task
was
to
fit
*NL*
up
the
house
for
the
reception
of
the
bride
.
In
the
midst
of
sheets
,
*NL*
tablecloths
,
towels
,
drapery
,
and
carpeting
,
my
head
was
as
busy
planning
,
*NL*
as
were
my
fingers
with
the
needle
.
At
noon
I
was
allowed
to
go
to
Ellen
.
*NL*
She
had
sobbed
herself
to
sleep
.
I
heard
Mr.
Flint
say
to
a
neighbor
,
``
I
've
*NL*
got
her
down
here
,
and
I
'll
soon
take
the
town
notions
out
of
her
head
.
My
*NL*
father
is
partly
to
blame
for
her
nonsense
.
He
ought
to
have
broke
her
in
*NL*
long
ago
.
''
The
remark
was
made
within
my
hearing
,
and
it
would
have
been
*NL*
quite
as
manly
to
have
made
it
to
my
face
.
He
_
had
_
said
things
to
my
face
*NL*
which
might
,
or
might
not
,
have
surprised
his
neighbor
if
he
had
known
of
*NL*
them
.
He
was
``
a
chip
of
the
old
block
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
resolved
to
give
him
no
cause
to
accuse
me
of
being
too
much
of
a
lady
,
*NL*
so
far
as
work
was
concerned
.
I
worked
day
and
night
,
with
wretchedness
*NL*
before
me
.
When
I
lay
down
beside
my
child
,
I
felt
how
much
easier
it
would
*NL*
be
to
see
her
die
than
to
see
her
master
beat
her
about
,
as
I
daily
saw
him
*NL*
beat
other
little
ones
.
The
spirit
of
the
mothers
was
so
crushed
by
the
*NL*
lash
,
that
they
stood
by
,
without
courage
to
remonstrate
.
How
much
more
*NL*
must
I
suffer
,
before
I
should
be
``
broke
in
''
to
that
degree
?
*NL*
*NL*
I
wished
to
appear
as
contented
as
possible
.
Sometimes
I
had
an
opportunity
*NL*
to
send
a
few
lines
home
;
and
this
brought
up
recollections
that
made
it
*NL*
difficult
,
for
a
time
,
to
seem
calm
and
indifferent
to
my
lot
.
*NL*
Notwithstanding
my
efforts
,
I
saw
that
Mr.
Flint
regarded
me
with
a
*NL*
suspicious
eye
.
Ellen
broke
down
under
the
trials
of
her
new
life
.
*NL*
Separated
from
me
,
with
no
one
to
look
after
her
,
she
wandered
about
,
and
*NL*
in
a
few
days
cried
herself
sick
.
One
day
,
she
sat
under
the
window
where
I
*NL*
was
at
work
,
crying
that
weary
cry
which
makes
a
mother
's
heart
bleed
.
I
*NL*
was
obliged
to
steel
myself
to
bear
it
.
After
a
while
it
ceased
.
I
looked
*NL*
out
,
and
she
was
gone
.
As
it
was
near
noon
,
I
ventured
to
go
down
in
search
*NL*
of
her
.
The
great
house
was
raised
two
feet
above
the
ground
.
I
looked
*NL*
under
it
,
and
saw
her
about
midway
,
fast
asleep
.
I
crept
under
and
drew
her
*NL*
out
.
As
I
held
her
in
my
arms
,
I
thought
how
well
it
would
be
for
her
if
*NL*
she
never
waked
up
;
and
I
uttered
my
thought
aloud
.
I
was
startled
to
hear
*NL*
some
one
say
,
``
Did
you
speak
to
me
?
''
I
looked
up
,
and
saw
Mr.
Flint
*NL*
standing
beside
me
.
He
said
nothing
further
,
but
turned
,
frowning
,
away
.
*NL*
That
night
he
sent
Ellen
a
biscuit
and
a
cup
of
sweetened
milk
.
This
*NL*
generosity
surprised
me
.
I
learned
afterwards
,
that
in
the
afternoon
he
had
*NL*
killed
a
large
snake
,
which
crept
from
under
the
house
;
and
I
supposed
that
*NL*
incident
had
prompted
his
unusual
kindness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
the
old
cart
was
loaded
with
shingles
for
town
.
I
put
*NL*
Ellen
into
it
,
and
sent
her
to
her
grandmother
.
Mr.
Flint
said
I
ought
to
*NL*
have
asked
his
permission
.
I
told
him
the
child
was
sick
,
and
required
*NL*
attention
which
I
had
no
time
to
give
.
He
let
it
pass
;
for
he
was
aware
*NL*
that
I
had
accomplished
much
work
in
a
little
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
been
three
weeks
on
the
plantation
,
when
I
planned
a
visit
home
.
It
*NL*
must
be
at
night
,
after
every
body
was
in
bed
.
I
was
six
miles
from
town
,
*NL*
and
the
road
was
very
dreary
.
I
was
to
go
with
a
young
man
,
who
,
I
knew
,
*NL*
often
stole
to
town
to
see
his
mother
.
One
night
,
when
all
was
quiet
,
we
*NL*
started
.
Fear
gave
speed
to
our
steps
,
and
we
were
not
long
in
performing
*NL*
the
journey
.
I
arrived
at
my
grandmother
's
.
Her
bed
room
was
on
the
first
*NL*
floor
,
and
the
window
was
open
,
the
weather
being
warm
.
I
spoke
to
her
and
*NL*
she
awoke
.
She
let
me
in
and
closed
the
window
,
lest
some
late
passer-by
*NL*
should
see
me
.
A
light
was
brought
,
and
the
whole
household
gathered
round
*NL*
me
,
some
smiling
and
some
crying
.
I
went
to
look
at
my
children
,
and
*NL*
thanked
God
for
their
happy
sleep
.
The
tears
fell
as
I
leaned
over
them
.
As
*NL*
I
moved
to
leave
,
Benny
stirred
.
I
turned
back
,
and
whispered
,
``
Mother
is
*NL*
here
.
''
After
digging
at
his
eyes
with
his
little
fist
,
they
opened
,
and
he
*NL*
sat
up
in
bed
,
looking
at
me
curiously
.
Having
satisfied
himself
that
it
*NL*
was
I
,
he
exclaimed
,
``
O
mother
!
you
ai
n't
dad
,
are
you
?
They
did
n't
cut
off
*NL*
your
head
at
the
plantation
,
did
they
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
time
was
up
too
soon
,
and
my
guide
was
waiting
for
me
.
I
laid
Benny
back
*NL*
in
his
bed
,
and
dried
his
tears
by
a
promise
to
come
again
soon
.
Rapidly
we
*NL*
retraced
our
steps
back
to
the
plantation
.
About
half
way
we
were
met
by
a
*NL*
company
of
four
patrols
.
Luckily
we
heard
their
horse
's
hoofs
before
they
*NL*
came
in
sight
,
and
we
had
time
to
hide
behind
a
large
tree
.
They
passed
,
*NL*
hallooing
and
shouting
in
a
manner
that
indicated
a
recent
carousal
.
How
*NL*
thankful
we
were
that
they
had
not
their
dogs
with
them
!
We
hastened
our
*NL*
footsteps
,
and
when
we
arrived
on
the
plantation
we
heard
the
sound
of
the
*NL*
hand-mill
.
The
slaves
were
grinding
their
corn
.
We
were
safely
in
the
house
*NL*
before
the
horn
summoned
them
to
their
labor
.
I
divided
my
little
parcel
of
*NL*
food
with
my
guide
,
knowing
that
he
had
lost
the
chance
of
grinding
his
*NL*
corn
,
and
must
toil
all
day
in
the
field
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Flint
often
took
an
inspection
of
the
house
,
to
see
that
no
one
was
*NL*
idle
.
The
entire
management
of
the
work
was
trusted
to
me
,
because
he
knew
*NL*
nothing
about
it
;
and
rather
than
hire
a
superintendent
he
contented
*NL*
himself
with
my
arrangements
.
He
had
often
urged
upon
his
father
the
*NL*
necessity
of
having
me
at
the
plantation
to
take
charge
of
his
affairs
,
and
*NL*
make
clothes
for
the
slaves
;
but
the
old
man
knew
him
too
well
to
consent
*NL*
to
that
arrangement
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
had
been
working
a
month
at
the
plantation
,
the
great
aunt
of
Mr.
*NL*
Flint
came
to
make
him
a
visit
.
This
was
the
good
old
lady
who
paid
fifty
*NL*
dollars
for
my
grandmother
,
for
the
purpose
of
making
her
free
,
when
she
*NL*
stood
on
the
auction
block
.
My
grandmother
loved
this
old
lady
,
whom
we
all
*NL*
called
Miss
Fanny
.
She
often
came
to
take
tea
with
us
.
On
such
occasions
*NL*
the
table
was
spread
with
a
snow-white
cloth
,
and
the
china
cups
and
silver
*NL*
spoons
were
taken
from
the
old-fashioned
buffet
.
There
were
hot
muffins
,
*NL*
tea
rusks
,
and
delicious
sweetmeats
.
My
grandmother
kept
two
cows
,
and
the
*NL*
fresh
cream
was
Miss
Fanny
's
delight
.
She
invariably
declared
that
it
was
*NL*
the
best
in
town
.
The
old
ladies
had
cosey
times
together
.
They
would
work
*NL*
and
chat
,
and
sometimes
,
while
talking
over
old
times
,
their
spectacles
*NL*
would
get
dim
with
tears
,
and
would
have
to
be
taken
off
and
wiped
.
When
*NL*
Miss
Fanny
bade
us
good
by
,
her
bag
was
filled
with
grandmother
's
best
*NL*
cakes
,
and
she
was
urged
to
come
again
soon
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
had
been
a
time
when
Dr.
Flint
's
wife
came
to
take
tea
with
us
,
and
*NL*
when
her
children
were
also
sent
to
have
a
feast
of
``
Aunt
Marthy
's
''
nice
*NL*
cooking
.
But
after
I
became
an
object
of
her
jealousy
and
spite
,
she
was
*NL*
angry
with
grandmother
for
giving
a
shelter
to
me
and
my
children
.
She
*NL*
would
not
even
speak
to
her
in
the
street
.
This
wounded
my
grandmother
's
*NL*
feelings
,
for
she
could
not
retain
ill
will
against
the
woman
whom
she
had
*NL*
nourished
with
her
milk
when
a
babe
.
The
doctor
's
wife
would
gladly
have
*NL*
prevented
our
intercourse
with
Miss
Fanny
if
she
could
have
done
it
,
but
*NL*
fortunately
she
was
not
dependent
on
the
bounty
of
the
Flints
.
She
had
*NL*
enough
to
be
independent
;
and
that
is
more
than
can
ever
be
gained
from
*NL*
charity
,
however
lavish
it
may
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Fanny
was
endeared
to
me
by
many
recollections
,
and
I
was
rejoiced
to
*NL*
see
her
at
the
plantation
.
The
warmth
of
her
large
,
loyal
heart
made
the
*NL*
house
seem
pleasanter
while
she
was
in
it
.
She
staid
a
week
,
and
I
had
many
*NL*
talks
with
her
.
She
said
her
principal
object
in
coming
was
to
see
how
I
*NL*
was
treated
,
and
whether
any
thing
could
be
done
for
me
.
She
inquired
*NL*
whether
she
could
help
me
in
any
way
.
I
told
her
I
believed
not
.
She
*NL*
condoled
with
me
in
her
own
peculiar
way
;
saying
she
wished
that
I
and
all
*NL*
my
grandmother
's
family
were
at
rest
in
our
graves
,
for
not
until
then
*NL*
should
she
feel
any
peace
about
us
.
The
good
old
soul
did
not
dream
that
I
*NL*
was
planning
to
bestow
peace
upon
her
,
with
regard
to
myself
and
my
*NL*
children
;
not
by
death
,
but
by
securing
our
freedom
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
and
again
I
had
traversed
those
dreary
twelve
miles
,
to
and
from
the
*NL*
town
;
and
all
the
way
,
I
was
meditating
upon
some
means
of
escape
for
*NL*
myself
and
my
children
.
My
friends
had
made
every
effort
that
ingenuity
*NL*
could
devise
to
effect
our
purchase
,
but
all
their
plans
had
proved
*NL*
abortive
.
Dr.
Flint
was
suspicious
,
and
determined
not
to
loosen
his
grasp
*NL*
upon
us
.
I
could
have
made
my
escape
alone
;
but
it
was
more
for
my
helpless
*NL*
children
than
for
myself
that
I
longed
for
freedom
.
Though
the
boon
would
*NL*
have
been
precious
to
me
,
above
all
price
,
I
would
not
have
taken
it
at
the
*NL*
expense
of
leaving
them
in
slavery
.
Every
trial
I
endured
,
every
sacrifice
*NL*
I
made
for
their
sakes
,
drew
them
closer
to
my
heart
,
and
gave
me
fresh
*NL*
courage
to
beat
back
the
dark
waves
that
rolled
and
rolled
over
me
in
a
*NL*
seemingly
endless
night
of
storms
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
six
weeks
were
nearly
completed
,
when
Mr.
Flint
's
bride
was
expected
to
*NL*
take
possession
of
her
new
home
.
The
arrangements
were
all
completed
,
and
*NL*
Mr.
Flint
said
I
had
done
well
.
He
expected
to
leave
home
on
Saturday
,
and
*NL*
return
with
his
bride
the
following
Wednesday
.
After
receiving
various
*NL*
orders
from
him
,
I
ventured
to
ask
permission
to
spend
Sunday
in
town
.
It
*NL*
was
granted
;
for
which
favor
I
was
thankful
.
It
was
the
first
I
had
ever
*NL*
asked
of
him
,
and
I
intended
it
should
be
the
last
.
I
needed
more
than
one
*NL*
night
to
accomplish
the
project
I
had
in
view
;
but
the
whole
of
Sunday
*NL*
would
give
me
an
opportunity
.
I
spent
the
Sabbath
with
my
grandmother
.
A
*NL*
calmer
,
more
beautiful
day
never
came
down
out
of
heaven
.
To
me
it
was
a
*NL*
day
of
conflicting
emotions
.
Perhaps
it
was
the
last
day
I
should
ever
*NL*
spend
under
that
dear
,
old
sheltering
roof
!
Perhaps
these
were
the
last
*NL*
talks
I
should
ever
have
with
the
faithful
old
friend
of
my
whole
life
!
*NL*
Perhaps
it
was
the
last
time
I
and
my
children
should
be
together
!
Well
,
*NL*
better
so
,
I
thought
,
than
that
they
should
be
slaves
.
I
knew
the
doom
that
*NL*
awaited
my
fair
baby
in
slavery
,
and
I
determined
to
save
her
from
it
,
or
*NL*
perish
in
the
attempt
.
I
went
to
make
this
vow
at
the
graves
of
my
poor
*NL*
parents
,
in
the
burying-ground
of
the
slaves
.
``
There
the
wicked
cease
from
*NL*
troubling
,
and
there
the
weary
be
at
rest
.
There
the
prisoners
rest
*NL*
together
;
they
hear
not
the
voice
of
the
oppressor
;
the
servant
is
free
*NL*
from
his
master
.
''
I
knelt
by
the
graves
of
my
parents
,
and
thanked
God
,
as
*NL*
I
had
often
done
before
,
that
they
had
not
lived
to
witness
my
trials
,
or
*NL*
to
mourn
over
my
sins
.
I
had
received
my
mother
's
blessing
when
she
died
;
*NL*
and
in
many
an
hour
of
tribulation
I
had
seemed
to
hear
her
voice
,
*NL*
sometimes
chiding
me
,
sometimes
whispering
loving
words
into
my
wounded
*NL*
heart
.
I
have
shed
many
and
bitter
tears
,
to
think
that
when
I
am
gone
from
*NL*
my
children
they
can
not
remember
me
with
such
entire
satisfaction
as
I
*NL*
remembered
my
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
graveyard
was
in
the
woods
,
and
twilight
was
coming
on
.
Nothing
broke
*NL*
the
death-like
stillness
except
the
occasional
twitter
of
a
bird
.
My
spirit
*NL*
was
overawed
by
the
solemnity
of
the
scene
.
For
more
than
ten
years
I
had
*NL*
frequented
this
spot
,
but
never
had
it
seemed
to
me
so
sacred
as
now
.
A
*NL*
black
stump
,
at
the
head
of
my
mother
's
grave
,
was
all
that
remained
of
a
*NL*
tree
my
father
had
planted
.
His
grave
was
marked
by
a
small
wooden
board
,
*NL*
bearing
his
name
,
the
letters
of
which
were
nearly
obliterated
.
I
knelt
*NL*
down
and
kissed
them
,
and
poured
forth
a
prayer
to
God
for
guidance
and
*NL*
support
in
the
perilous
step
I
was
about
to
take
.
As
I
passed
the
wreck
of
*NL*
the
old
meeting
house
,
where
,
before
Nat
Turner
's
time
,
the
slaves
had
been
*NL*
allowed
to
meet
for
worship
,
I
seemed
to
hear
my
father
's
voice
come
from
*NL*
it
,
bidding
me
not
to
tarry
till
I
reached
freedom
or
the
grave
.
I
rushed
*NL*
on
with
renovated
hopes
.
My
trust
in
God
had
been
strengthened
by
that
*NL*
prayer
among
the
graves
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
plan
was
to
conceal
myself
at
the
house
of
a
friend
,
and
remain
there
a
*NL*
few
weeks
till
the
search
was
over
.
My
hope
was
that
the
doctor
would
get
*NL*
discouraged
,
and
,
for
fear
of
losing
my
value
,
and
also
of
subsequently
*NL*
finding
my
children
among
the
missing
,
he
would
consent
to
sell
us
;
and
I
*NL*
knew
somebody
would
buy
us
.
I
had
done
all
in
my
power
to
make
my
children
*NL*
comfortable
during
the
time
I
expected
to
be
separated
from
them
.
I
was
*NL*
packing
my
things
,
when
grandmother
came
into
the
room
,
and
asked
what
I
*NL*
was
doing
.
``
I
am
putting
my
things
in
order
,
''
I
replied
.
I
tried
to
look
*NL*
and
speak
cheerfully
;
but
her
watchful
eye
detected
something
beneath
the
*NL*
surface
.
She
drew
me
towards
her
,
and
asked
me
to
sit
down
.
She
looked
*NL*
earnestly
at
me
,
and
said
,
``
Linda
,
do
you
want
to
kill
your
old
*NL*
grandmother
?
Do
you
mean
to
leave
your
little
,
helpless
children
?
I
am
old
*NL*
now
,
and
can
not
do
for
your
babies
as
I
once
did
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
replied
,
that
if
I
went
away
,
perhaps
their
father
would
be
able
to
*NL*
secure
their
freedom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my
child
,
''
said
she
,
``
do
n't
trust
too
much
to
him
.
Stand
by
your
own
*NL*
children
,
and
suffer
with
them
till
death
.
Nobody
respects
a
mother
who
*NL*
forsakes
her
children
;
and
if
you
leave
them
,
you
will
never
have
a
happy
*NL*
moment
.
If
you
go
,
you
will
make
me
miserable
the
short
time
I
have
to
*NL*
live
.
You
would
be
taken
and
brought
back
,
and
your
sufferings
would
be
*NL*
dreadful
.
Remember
poor
Benjamin
.
Do
give
it
up
,
Linda
.
Try
to
bear
a
*NL*
little
longer
.
Things
may
turn
out
better
than
we
expect
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
courage
failed
me
,
in
view
of
the
sorrow
I
should
bring
on
that
*NL*
faithful
,
loving
old
heart
.
I
promised
that
I
would
try
longer
,
and
that
I
*NL*
would
take
nothing
out
of
her
house
without
her
knowledge
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whenever
the
children
climbed
on
my
knee
,
or
laid
their
heads
on
my
lap
,
*NL*
she
would
say
,
``
Poor
little
souls
!
what
would
you
do
without
a
mother
?
She
*NL*
do
n't
love
you
as
I
do
.
''
And
she
would
hug
them
to
her
own
bosom
,
as
if
to
*NL*
reproach
me
for
my
want
of
affection
;
but
she
knew
all
the
while
that
I
*NL*
loved
them
better
than
my
life
.
I
slept
with
her
that
night
,
and
it
was
the
*NL*
last
time
.
The
memory
of
it
haunted
me
for
many
a
year
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
Monday
I
returned
to
the
plantation
,
and
busied
myself
with
preparations
*NL*
for
the
important
day
.
Wednesday
came
.
It
was
a
beautiful
day
,
and
the
*NL*
faces
of
the
slaves
were
as
bright
as
the
sunshine
.
The
poor
creatures
were
*NL*
merry
.
They
were
expecting
little
presents
from
the
bride
,
and
hoping
for
*NL*
better
times
under
her
administration
.
I
had
no
such
hopes
for
them
.
I
knew
*NL*
that
the
young
wives
of
slaveholders
often
thought
their
authority
and
*NL*
importance
would
be
best
established
and
maintained
by
cruelty
;
and
what
I
*NL*
had
heard
of
young
Mrs.
Flint
gave
me
no
reason
to
expect
that
her
rule
*NL*
over
them
would
be
less
severe
than
that
of
the
master
and
overseer
.
Truly
,
*NL*
the
colored
race
are
the
most
cheerful
and
forgiving
people
on
the
face
of
*NL*
the
earth
.
That
their
masters
sleep
in
safety
is
owing
to
their
*NL*
superabundance
of
heart
;
and
yet
they
look
upon
their
sufferings
with
less
*NL*
pity
than
they
would
bestow
on
those
of
a
horse
or
a
dog
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
stood
at
the
door
with
others
to
receive
the
bridegroom
and
bride
.
She
*NL*
was
a
handsome
,
delicate-looking
girl
,
and
her
face
flushed
with
emotion
at
*NL*
sight
of
her
new
home
.
I
thought
it
likely
that
visions
of
a
happy
future
*NL*
were
rising
before
her
.
It
made
me
sad
;
for
I
knew
how
soon
clouds
would
*NL*
come
over
her
sunshine
.
She
examined
every
part
of
the
house
,
and
told
me
*NL*
she
was
delighted
with
the
arrangements
I
had
made
.
I
was
afraid
old
Mrs.
*NL*
Flint
had
tried
to
prejudice
her
against
me
,
and
I
did
my
best
to
please
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
passed
off
smoothly
for
me
until
dinner
time
arrived
.
I
did
not
mind
*NL*
the
embarrassment
of
waiting
on
a
dinner
party
,
for
the
first
time
in
my
*NL*
life
,
half
so
much
as
I
did
the
meeting
with
Dr.
Flint
and
his
wife
,
who
*NL*
would
be
among
the
guests
.
It
was
a
mystery
to
me
why
Mrs.
Flint
had
not
*NL*
made
her
appearance
at
the
plantation
during
all
the
time
I
was
putting
the
*NL*
house
in
order
.
I
had
not
met
her
,
face
to
face
,
for
five
years
,
and
I
had
*NL*
no
wish
to
see
her
now
.
She
was
a
praying
woman
,
and
,
doubtless
,
considered
*NL*
my
present
position
a
special
answer
to
her
prayers
.
Nothing
could
please
*NL*
her
better
than
to
see
me
humbled
and
trampled
upon
.
I
was
just
where
she
*NL*
would
have
me
--
in
the
power
of
a
hard
,
unprincipled
master
.
She
did
not
*NL*
speak
to
me
when
she
took
her
seat
at
table
;
but
her
satisfied
,
triumphant
*NL*
smile
,
when
I
handed
her
plate
,
was
more
eloquent
than
words
.
The
old
*NL*
doctor
was
not
so
quiet
in
his
demonstrations
.
He
ordered
me
here
and
*NL*
there
,
and
spoke
with
peculiar
emphasis
when
he
said
``
your
_
mistress
_
.
''
I
*NL*
was
drilled
like
a
disgraced
soldier
.
When
all
was
over
,
and
the
last
key
*NL*
turned
,
I
sought
my
pillow
,
thankful
that
God
had
appointed
a
season
of
*NL*
rest
for
the
weary
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
my
new
mistress
began
her
housekeeping
.
I
was
not
exactly
*NL*
appointed
maid
of
all
work
;
but
I
was
to
do
whatever
I
was
told
.
Monday
*NL*
evening
came
.
It
was
always
a
busy
time
.
On
that
night
the
slaves
received
*NL*
their
weekly
allowance
of
food
.
Three
pounds
of
meat
,
a
peck
of
corn
,
and
*NL*
perhaps
a
dozen
herring
were
allowed
to
each
man
.
Women
received
a
pound
*NL*
and
a
half
of
meat
,
a
peck
of
corn
,
and
the
same
number
of
herring
.
*NL*
Children
over
twelve
years
old
had
half
the
allowance
of
the
women
.
The
*NL*
meat
was
cut
and
weighed
by
the
foreman
of
the
field
hands
,
and
piled
on
*NL*
planks
before
the
meat
house
.
Then
the
second
foreman
went
behind
the
*NL*
building
,
and
when
the
first
foreman
called
out
,
``
Who
takes
this
piece
of
*NL*
meat
?
''
he
answered
by
calling
somebody
's
name
.
This
method
was
resorted
to
*NL*
as
a
means
of
preventing
partiality
in
distributing
the
meat
.
The
young
*NL*
mistress
came
out
to
see
how
things
were
done
on
her
plantation
,
and
she
*NL*
soon
gave
a
specimen
of
her
character
.
Among
those
in
waiting
for
their
*NL*
allowance
was
a
very
old
slave
,
who
had
faithfully
served
the
Flint
family
*NL*
through
three
generations
.
When
he
hobbled
up
to
get
his
bit
of
meat
,
the
*NL*
mistress
said
he
was
too
old
to
have
any
allowance
;
that
when
niggers
were
*NL*
too
old
to
work
,
they
ought
to
be
fed
on
grass
.
Poor
old
man
!
He
suffered
*NL*
much
before
he
found
rest
in
the
grave
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
mistress
and
I
got
along
very
well
together
.
At
the
end
of
a
week
,
old
*NL*
Mrs.
Flint
made
us
another
visit
,
and
was
closeted
a
long
time
with
her
*NL*
daughter-in-law
.
I
had
my
suspicions
what
was
the
subject
of
the
*NL*
conference
.
The
old
doctor
's
wife
had
been
informed
that
I
could
leave
the
*NL*
plantation
on
one
condition
,
and
she
was
very
desirous
to
keep
me
there
.
If
*NL*
she
had
trusted
me
,
as
I
deserved
to
be
trusted
by
her
,
she
would
have
had
*NL*
no
fears
of
my
accepting
that
condition
.
When
she
entered
her
carriage
to
*NL*
return
home
,
she
said
to
young
Mrs.
Flint
,
``
Do
n't
neglect
to
send
for
them
*NL*
as
quick
as
possible
.
''
My
heart
was
on
the
watch
all
the
time
,
and
I
at
*NL*
once
concluded
that
she
spoke
of
my
children
.
The
doctor
came
the
next
day
,
*NL*
and
as
I
entered
the
room
to
spread
the
tea
table
,
I
heard
him
say
,
``
Do
n't
*NL*
wait
any
longer
.
Send
for
them
to-morrow
.
''
I
saw
through
the
plan
.
They
*NL*
thought
my
children
's
being
there
would
fetter
me
to
the
spot
,
and
that
it
*NL*
was
a
good
place
to
break
us
all
in
to
abject
submission
to
our
lot
as
*NL*
slaves
.
After
the
doctor
left
,
a
gentleman
called
,
who
had
always
*NL*
manifested
friendly
feelings
towards
my
grandmother
and
her
family
.
Mr.
*NL*
Flint
carried
him
over
the
plantation
to
show
him
the
results
of
labor
*NL*
performed
by
men
and
women
who
were
unpaid
,
miserably
clothed
,
and
half
*NL*
famished
.
The
cotton
crop
was
all
they
thought
of
.
It
was
duly
admired
,
and
*NL*
the
gentleman
returned
with
specimens
to
show
his
friends
.
I
was
ordered
to
*NL*
carry
water
to
wash
his
hands
.
As
I
did
so
,
he
said
,
``
Linda
,
how
do
you
*NL*
like
your
new
home
?
''
I
told
him
I
liked
it
as
well
as
I
expected
.
He
*NL*
replied
,
``
They
do
n't
think
you
are
contented
,
and
to-morrow
they
are
going
*NL*
to
bring
your
children
to
be
with
you
.
I
am
sorry
for
you
,
Linda
.
I
hope
*NL*
they
will
treat
you
kindly
.
''
I
hurried
from
the
room
,
unable
to
thank
him
.
*NL*
My
suspicions
were
correct
.
My
children
were
to
be
brought
to
the
*NL*
plantation
to
be
``
broke
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
day
I
feel
grateful
to
the
gentleman
who
gave
me
this
timely
*NL*
information
.
It
nerved
me
to
immediate
action
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XVII
.
The
Flight
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Flint
was
hard
pushed
for
house
servants
,
and
rather
than
lose
me
he
*NL*
had
restrained
his
malice
.
I
did
my
work
faithfully
,
though
not
,
of
course
,
*NL*
with
a
willing
mind
.
They
were
evidently
afraid
I
should
leave
them
.
Mr.
*NL*
Flint
wished
that
I
should
sleep
in
the
great
house
instead
of
the
*NL*
servants
'
quarters
.
His
wife
agreed
to
the
proposition
,
but
said
I
must
n't
*NL*
bring
my
bed
into
the
house
,
because
it
would
scatter
feathers
on
her
*NL*
carpet
.
I
knew
when
I
went
there
that
they
would
never
think
of
such
a
*NL*
thing
as
furnishing
a
bed
of
any
kind
for
me
and
my
little
ones
.
I
*NL*
therefore
carried
my
own
bed
,
and
now
I
was
forbidden
to
use
it
.
I
did
as
I
*NL*
was
ordered
.
But
now
that
I
was
certain
my
children
were
to
be
put
in
their
*NL*
power
,
in
order
to
give
them
a
stronger
hold
on
me
,
I
resolved
to
leave
*NL*
them
that
night
.
I
remembered
the
grief
this
step
would
bring
upon
my
dear
*NL*
old
grandmother
,
and
nothing
less
than
the
freedom
of
my
children
would
*NL*
have
induced
me
to
disregard
her
advice
.
I
went
about
my
evening
work
with
*NL*
trembling
steps
.
Mr.
Flint
twice
called
from
his
chamber
door
to
inquire
*NL*
why
the
house
was
not
locked
up
.
I
replied
that
I
had
not
done
my
work
.
*NL*
``
You
have
had
time
enough
to
do
it
,
''
said
he
.
``
Take
care
how
you
answer
*NL*
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
shut
all
the
windows
,
locked
all
the
doors
,
and
went
up
to
the
third
*NL*
story
,
to
wait
till
midnight
.
How
long
those
hours
seemed
,
and
how
*NL*
fervently
I
prayed
that
God
would
not
forsake
me
in
this
hour
of
utmost
*NL*
need
!
I
was
about
to
risk
every
thing
on
the
throw
of
a
die
;
and
if
I
*NL*
failed
,
O
what
would
become
of
me
and
my
poor
children
?
They
would
be
made
*NL*
to
suffer
for
my
fault
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
half
past
twelve
I
stole
softly
down
stairs
.
I
stopped
on
the
second
*NL*
floor
,
thinking
I
heard
a
noise
.
I
felt
my
way
down
into
the
parlor
,
and
*NL*
looked
out
of
the
window
.
The
night
was
so
intensely
dark
that
I
could
see
*NL*
nothing
.
I
raised
the
window
very
softly
and
jumped
out
.
Large
drops
of
*NL*
rain
were
falling
,
and
the
darkness
bewildered
me
.
I
dropped
on
my
knees
,
*NL*
and
breathed
a
short
prayer
to
God
for
guidance
and
protection
.
I
groped
my
*NL*
way
to
the
road
,
and
rushed
towards
the
town
with
almost
lightning
speed
.
I
*NL*
arrived
at
my
grandmother
's
house
,
but
dared
not
see
her
.
She
would
say
,
*NL*
``
Linda
,
you
are
killing
me
;
''
and
I
knew
that
would
unnerve
me
.
I
tapped
*NL*
softly
at
the
window
of
a
room
,
occupied
by
a
woman
,
who
had
lived
in
the
*NL*
house
several
years
.
I
knew
she
was
a
faithful
friend
,
and
could
be
trusted
*NL*
with
my
secret
.
I
tapped
several
times
before
she
heard
me
.
At
last
she
*NL*
raised
the
window
,
and
I
whispered
,
``
Sally
,
I
have
run
away
.
Let
me
in
,
*NL*
quick
.
''
She
opened
the
door
softly
,
and
said
in
low
tones
,
``
For
God
's
sake
,
*NL*
do
n't
.
Your
grandmother
is
trying
to
buy
you
and
de
chillern
.
Mr.
Sands
was
*NL*
here
last
week
.
He
tole
her
he
was
going
away
on
business
,
but
he
wanted
*NL*
her
to
go
ahead
about
buying
you
and
de
chillern
,
and
he
would
help
her
all
*NL*
he
could
.
Do
n't
run
away
,
Linda
.
Your
grandmother
is
all
bowed
down
wid
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
I
replied
,
``
Sally
,
they
are
going
to
carry
my
children
to
the
plantation
*NL*
to-morrow
;
and
they
will
never
sell
them
to
any
body
so
long
as
they
have
*NL*
me
in
their
power
.
Now
,
would
you
advise
me
to
go
back
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

chile
,
no

''
answered
she
.
``
When
dey
finds
you

gone
,
dey
wo

but
where
is
you
going
to
hide
?
Dey

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
her
I
had
a
hiding-place
,
and
that
was
all
it
was
best
for
her
to
*NL*
know
.
I
asked
her
to
go
into
my
room
as
soon
as
it
was
light
,
and
take
all
*NL*
my
clothes
out
of
my
trunk
,
and
pack
them
in
hers
;
for
I
knew
Mr.
Flint
and
*NL*
the
constable
would
be
there
early
to
search
my
room
.
I
feared
the
sight
of
*NL*
my
children
would
be
too
much
for
my
full
heart
;
but
I
could
not
go
into
*NL*
the
uncertain
future
without
one
last
look
.
I
bent
over
the
bed
where
lay
*NL*
my
little
Benny
and
baby
Ellen
.
Poor
little
ones
!
fatherless
and
*NL*
motherless
!
Memories
of
their
father
came
over
me
.
He
wanted
to
be
kind
to
*NL*
them
;
but
they
were
not
all
to
him
,
as
they
were
to
my
womanly
heart
.
I
*NL*
knelt
and
prayed
for
the
innocent
little
sleepers
.
I
kissed
them
lightly
,
*NL*
and
turned
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
was
about
to
open
the
street
door
,
Sally
laid
her
hand
on
my
shoulder
,
*NL*
and
said
,
``
Linda
,
is
you
gwine
all
alone
?
Let
me
call
your
uncle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Sally
,
''
I
replied
,
``
I
want
no
one
to
be
brought
into
trouble
on
my
*NL*
account
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
forth
into
the
darkness
and
rain
.
I
ran
on
till
I
came
to
the
house
*NL*
of
the
friend
who
was
to
conceal
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Early
the
next
morning
Mr.
Flint
was
at
my
grandmother
's
inquiring
for
me
.
*NL*
She
told
him
she
had
not
seen
me
,
and
supposed
I
was
at
the
plantation
.
He
*NL*
watched
her
face
narrowly
,
and
said
,
``
Do
n't
you
know
any
thing
about
her
*NL*
running
off
?
''
She
assured
him
that
she
did
not
.
He
went
on
to
say
,
``
Last
*NL*
night
she
ran
off
without
the
least
provocation
.
We
had
treated
her
very
*NL*
kindly
.
My
wife
liked
her
.
She
will
soon
be
found
and
brought
back
.
Are
her
*NL*
children
with
you
?
''
When
told
that
they
were
,
he
said
,
``
I
am
very
glad
to
*NL*
hear
that
.
If
they
are
here
,
she
can
not
be
far
off
.
If
I
find
out
that
any
*NL*
of
my
niggers
have
had
any
thing
to
do
with
this
damned
business
,
I
'll
give
*NL*
'em
five
hundred
lashes
.
''
As
he
started
to
go
to
his
father
's
,
he
turned
*NL*
round
and
added
,
persuasively
,
``
Let
her
be
brought
back
,
and
she
shall
have
*NL*
her
children
to
live
with
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
tidings
made
the
old
doctor
rave
and
storm
at
a
furious
rate
.
It
was
a
*NL*
busy
day
for
them
.
My
grandmother
's
house
was
searched
from
top
to
bottom
.
*NL*
As
my
trunk
was
empty
,
they
concluded
I
had
taken
my
clothes
with
me
.
*NL*
Before
ten
o'clock
every
vessel
northward
bound
was
thoroughly
examined
,
*NL*
and
the
law
against
harboring
fugitives
was
read
to
all
on
board
.
At
night
*NL*
a
watch
was
set
over
the
town
.
Knowing
how
distressed
my
grandmother
would
*NL*
be
,
I
wanted
to
send
her
a
message
;
but
it
could
not
be
done
.
Every
one
who
*NL*
went
in
or
out
of
her
house
was
closely
watched
.
The
doctor
said
he
would
*NL*
take
my
children
,
unless
she
became
responsible
for
them
;
which
of
course
*NL*
she
willingly
did
.
The
next
day
was
spent
in
searching
.
Before
night
,
the
*NL*
following
advertisement
was
posted
at
every
corner
,
and
in
every
public
*NL*
place
for

Months
Of
Peril
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
search
for
me
was
kept
up
with
more
perseverence
than
I
had
*NL*
anticipated
.
I
began
to
think
that
escape
was
impossible
.
I
was
in
great
*NL*
anxiety
lest
I
should
implicate
the
friend
who
harbored
me
.
I
knew
the
*NL*
consequences
would
be
frightful
;
and
much
as
I
dreaded
being
caught
,
even
*NL*
that
seemed
better
than
causing
an
innocent
person
to
suffer
for
kindness
*NL*
to
me
.
A
week
had
passed
in
terrible
suspense
,
when
my
pursuers
came
into
*NL*
such
close
vicinity
that
I
concluded
they
had
tracked
me
to
my
*NL*
hiding-place
.
I
flew
out
of
the
house
,
and
concealed
myself
in
a
thicket
of
*NL*
bushes
.
There
I
remained
in
an
agony
of
fear
for
two
hours
.
Suddenly
,
a
*NL*
reptile
of
some
kind
seized
my
leg
.
In
my
fright
,
I
struck
a
blow
which
*NL*
loosened
its
hold
,
but
I
could
not
tell
whether
I
had
killed
it
;
it
was
so
*NL*
dark
,
I
could
not
see
what
it
was
;
I
only
knew
it
was
something
cold
and
*NL*
slimy
.
The
pain
I
felt
soon
indicated
that
the
bite
was
poisonous
.
I
was
*NL*
compelled
to
leave
my
place
of
concealment
,
and
I
groped
my
way
back
into
*NL*
the
house
.
The
pain
had
become
intense
,
and
my
friend
was
startled
by
my
*NL*
look
of
anguish
.
I
asked
her
to
prepare
a
poultice
of
warm
ashes
and
*NL*
vinegar
,
and
I
applied
it
to
my
leg
,
which
was
already
much
swollen
.
The
*NL*
application
gave
me
some
relief
,
but
the
swelling
did
not
abate
.
The
dread
*NL*
of
being
disabled
was
greater
than
the
physical
pain
I
endured
.
My
friend
*NL*
asked
an
old
woman
,
who
doctored
among
the
slaves
,
what
was
good
for
the
*NL*
bite
of
a
snake
or
a
lizard
.
She
told
her
to
steep
a
dozen
coppers
in
*NL*
vinegar
,
over
night
,
and
apply
the
cankered
vinegar
to
the
inflamed
*NL*
part
.

*NL*
I
had
succeeded
in
cautiously
conveying
some
messages
to
my
relatives
.
They
*NL*
were
harshly
threatened
,
and
despairing
of
my
having
a
chance
to
escape
,
*NL*
they
advised
me
to
return
to
my
master
,
ask
his
forgiveness
,
and
let
him
*NL*
make
an
example
of
me
.
But
such
counsel
had
no
influence
with
me
.
When
I
*NL*
started
upon
this
hazardous
undertaking
,
I
had
resolved
that
,
come
what
*NL*
would
,
there
should
be
no
turning
back
.
``
Give
me
liberty
,
or
give
me
*NL*
death
,
''
was
my
motto
.
When
my
friend
contrived
to
make
known
to
my
*NL*
relatives
the
painful
situation
I
had
been
in
for
twenty-four
hours
,
they
*NL*
said
no
more
about
my
going
back
to
my
master
.
Something
must
be
done
,
and
*NL*
that
speedily
;
but
where
to
return
for
help
,
they
knew
not
.
God
in
his
*NL*
mercy
raised
up
``
a
friend
in
need
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Among
the
ladies
who
were
acquainted
with
my
grandmother
,
was
one
who
had
*NL*
known
her
from
childhood
,
and
always
been
very
friendly
to
her
.
She
had
*NL*
also
known
my
mother
and
her
children
,
and
felt
interested
for
them
.
At
*NL*
this
crisis
of
affairs
she
called
to
see
my
grandmother
,
as
she
not
*NL*
unfrequently
did
.
She
observed
the
sad
and
troubled
expression
of
her
face
,
*NL*
and
asked
if
she
knew
where
Linda
was
,
and
whether
she
was
safe
.
My
*NL*
grandmother
shook
her
head
,
without
answering
.
``
Come
,
Aunt
Martha
,
''
*NL*
said
the
kind
lady
,
``
tell
me
all
about
it
.
Perhaps
I
can
do
something
*NL*
to
help
you
.
''
The
husband
of
this
lady
held
many
slaves
,
and
bought
and
*NL*
sold
slaves
.
She
also
held
a
number
in
her
own
name
;
but
she
treated
*NL*
them
kindly
,
and
would
never
allow
any
of
them
to
be
sold
.
She
was
*NL*
unlike
the
majority
of
slaveholders
'
wives
.
My
grandmother
looked
*NL*
earnestly
at
her
.
Something
in
the
expression
of
her
face
said
*NL*
``
Trust
me
!
''
and
she
did
trust
her
.
She
listened
attentively
to
*NL*
the
details
of
my
story
,
and
sat
thinking
for
a
while
.
At
last
she
said
,
*NL*
``
Aunt
Martha
,
I
pity
you
both
.
If
you
think
there
is
any
chance
of
Linda
's
*NL*
getting
to
the
Free
States
,
I
will
conceal
her
for
a
time
.
But
first
you
*NL*
must
solemnly
promise
that
my
name
shall
never
be
mentioned
.
If
such
a
*NL*
thing
should
become
known
,
it
would
ruin
me
and
my
family
.
No
one
in
my
*NL*
house
must
know
of
it
,
except
the
cook
.
She
is
so
faithful
that
I
would
*NL*
trust
my
own
life
with
her
;
and
I
know
she
likes
Linda
.
It
is
a
great
risk
;
*NL*
but
I
trust
no
harm
will
come
of
it
.
Get
word
to
Linda
to
be
ready
as
soon
*NL*
as
it
is
dark
,
before
the
patrols
are
out
.
I
will
send
the
housemaids
on
*NL*
errands
,
and
Betty
shall
go
to
meet
Linda
.
''
The
place
where
we
were
to
meet
*NL*
was
designated
and
agreed
upon
.
My
grandmother
was
unable
to
thank
the
lady
*NL*
for
this
noble
deed
;
overcome
by
her
emotions
,
she
sank
on
her
knees
and
*NL*
sobbed
like
a
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
received
a
message
to
leave
my
friend
's
house
at
such
an
hour
,
and
go
to
*NL*
a
certain
place
where
a
friend
would
be
waiting
for
me
.
As
a
matter
of
*NL*
prudence
no
names
were
mentioned
.
I
had
no
means
of
conjecturing
who
I
was
*NL*
to
meet
,
or
where
I
was
going
.
I
did
not
like
to
move
thus
blindfolded
,
but
*NL*
I
had
no
choice
.
It
would
not
do
for
me
to
remain
where
I
was
.
I
disguised
*NL*
myself
,
summoned
up
courage
to
meet
the
worst
,
and
went
to
the
appointed
*NL*
place
.
My
friend
Betty
was
there
;
she
was
the
last
person
I
expected
to
*NL*
see
.
We
hurried
along
in
silence
.
The
pain
in
my
leg
was
so
intense
that
it
*NL*
seemed
as
if
I
should
drop
but
fear
gave
me
strength
.
We
reached
the
house
*NL*
and
entered
unobserved
.
Her
first
words
were
:
``
Honey
,
now
you
is
safe
.
Dem
*NL*
devils
ai
n't
coming
to
search
_
dis
_
house
.
When
I
get
you
into
missis
'
safe
*NL*
place
,
I
will
bring
some
nice
hot
supper
.
I
specs
you
need
it
after
all
dis
*NL*
skeering
.
''
Betty
's
vocation
led
her
to
think
eating
the
most
important
*NL*
thing
in
life
.
She
did
not
realize
that
my
heart
was
too
full
for
me
to
*NL*
care
much
about
supper
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mistress
came
to
meet
us
,
and
led
me
up
stairs
to
a
small
room
over
her
*NL*
own
sleeping
apartment
.
``
You
will
be
safe
here
,
Linda
,
''
said
she
;
``
I
keep
*NL*
this
room
to
store
away
things
that
are
out
of
use
.
The
girls
are
not
*NL*
accustomed
to
be
sent
to
it
,
and
they
will
not
suspect
any
thing
unless
*NL*
they
hear
some
noise
.
I
always
keep
it
locked
,
and
Betty
shall
take
care
of
*NL*
the
key
.
But
you
must
be
very
careful
,
for
my
sake
as
well
as
your
own
;
and
*NL*
you
must
never
tell
my
secret
;
for
it
would
ruin
me
and
my
family
.
I
will
*NL*
keep
the
girls
busy
in
the
morning
,
that
Betty
may
have
a
chance
to
bring
*NL*
your
breakfast
;
but
it
will
not
do
for
her
to
come
to
you
again
till
night
.
*NL*
I
will
come
to
see
you
sometimes
.
Keep
up
your
courage
.
I
hope
this
state
*NL*
of
things
will
not
last
long
.
''
Betty
came
with
the
``
nice
hot
supper
,
''
and
*NL*
the
mistress
hastened
down
stairs
to
keep
things
straight
till
she
*NL*
returned
.
How
my
heart
overflowed
with
gratitude
!
Words
choked
in
my
*NL*
throat
;
but
I
could
have
kissed
the
feet
of
my
benefactress
.
For
that
deed
*NL*
of
Christian
womanhood
,
may
God
forever
bless
her
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
to
sleep
that
night
with
the
feeling
that
I
was
for
the
present
the
*NL*
most
fortunate
slave
in
town
.
Morning
came
and
filled
my
little
cell
with
*NL*
light
.
I
thanked
the
heavenly
Father
for
this
safe
retreat
.
Opposite
my
*NL*
window
was
a
pile
of
feather
beds
.
On
the
top
of
these
I
could
lie
*NL*
perfectly
concealed
,
and
command
a
view
of
the
street
through
which
Dr.
*NL*
Flint
passed
to
his
office
.
Anxious
as
I
was
,
I
felt
a
gleam
of
*NL*
satisfaction
when
I
saw
him
.
Thus
far
I
had
outwitted
him
,
and
I
triumphed
*NL*
over
it
.
Who
can
blame
slaves
for
being
cunning
?
They
are
constantly
*NL*
compelled
to
resort
to
it
.
It
is
the
only
weapon
of
the
weak
and
oppressed
*NL*
against
the
strength
of
their
tyrants
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
daily
hoping
to
hear
that
my
master
had
sold
my
children
;
for
I
knew
*NL*
who
was
on
the
watch
to
buy
them
.
But
Dr.
Flint
cared
even
more
for
revenge
*NL*
than
he
did
for
money
.
My
brother
William
and
the
good
aunt
who
had
served
*NL*
in
his
family
twenty
years
,
and
my
little
Benny
,
and
Ellen
,
who
was
a
*NL*
little
over
two
years
old
,
were
thrust
into
jail
,
as
a
means
of
compelling
*NL*
my
relatives
to
give
some
information
about
me
.
He
swore
my
grandmother
*NL*
should
never
see
one
of
them
again
till
I
was
brought
back
.
They
kept
these
*NL*
facts
from
me
for
several
days
.
When
I
heard
that
my
little
ones
were
in
a
*NL*
loathsome
jail
,
my
first
impulse
was
to
go
to
them
.
I
was
encountering
*NL*
dangers
for
the
sake
of
freeing
them
,
and
must
I
be
the
cause
of
their
*NL*
death
?
The
thought
was
agonizing
.
My
benefactress
tried
to
soothe
me
by
*NL*
telling
me
that
my
aunt
would
take
good
care
of
the
children
while
they
*NL*
remained
in
jail
.
But
it
added
to
my
pain
to
think
that
the
good
old
aunt
,
*NL*
who
had
always
been
so
kind
to
her
sister
's
orphan
children
,
should
be
shut
*NL*
up
in
prison
for
no
other
crime
than
loving
them
.
I
suppose
my
friends
*NL*
feared
a
reckless
movement
on
my
part
,
knowing
,
as
they
did
,
that
my
life
*NL*
was
bound
up
in
my
children
.
I
received
a
note
from
my
brother
William
.
It
*NL*
was
scarcely
legible
,
and
ran
thus
:
``
Wherever
you
are
,
dear
sister
,
I
beg
*NL*
of
you
not
to
come
here
.
We
are
all
much
better
off
than
you
are
.
If
you
*NL*
come
,
you
will
ruin
us
all
.
They
would
force
you
to
tell
where
you
had
*NL*
been
,
or
they
would
kill
you
.
Take
the
advice
of
your
friends
;
if
not
for
*NL*
the
sake
of
me
and
your
children
,
at
least
for
the
sake
of
those
you
would
*NL*
ruin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
William
!
He
also
must
suffer
for
being
my
brother
.
I
took
his
advice
*NL*
and
kept
quiet
.
My
aunt
was
taken
out
of
jail
at
the
end
of
a
month
,
*NL*
because
Mrs.
Flint
could
not
spare
her
any
longer
.
She
was
tired
of
being
*NL*
her
own
housekeeper
.
It
was
quite
too
fatiguing
to
order
her
dinner
and
eat
*NL*
it
too
.
My
children
remained
in
jail
,
where
brother
William
did
all
he
*NL*
could
for
their
comfort
.
Betty
went
to
see
them
sometimes
,
and
brought
me
*NL*
tidings
.
She
was
not
permitted
to
enter
the
jail
;
but
William
would
hold
*NL*
them
up
to
the
grated
window
while
she
chatted
with
them
.
When
she
repeated
*NL*
their
prattle
,
and
told
me
how
they
wanted
to
see
their
ma
,
my
tears
would
*NL*
flow
.
Old
Betty
would
exclaim
,
``
Lors
,
chile
!
what
's
you
crying
`
bout
?
Dem
*NL*
young
uns
vil
kill
you
dead
.
Do
n't
be
so
chick
'n
hearted
!
If
you
does
,
you
*NL*
vil
nebber
git
thro
'
dis
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Good
old
soul
!
She
had
gone
through
the
world
childless
.
She
had
never
had
*NL*
little
ones
to
clasp
their
arms
round
her
neck
;
she
had
never
seen
their
*NL*
soft
eyes
looking
into
hers
;
no
sweet
little
voices
had
called
her
mother
;
*NL*
she
had
never
pressed
her
own
infants
to
her
heart
,
with
the
feeling
that
*NL*
even
in
fetters
there
was
something
to
live
for
.
How
could
she
realize
my
*NL*
feelings
?
Betty
's
husband
loved
children
dearly
,
and
wondered
why
God
had
*NL*
denied
them
to
him
.
He
expressed
great
sorrow
when
he
came
to
Betty
with
*NL*
the
tidings
that
Ellen
had
been
taken
out
of
jail
and
carried
to
Dr.
*NL*
Flint
's
.
She
had
the
measles
a
short
time
before
they
carried
her
to
jail
,
*NL*
and
the
disease
had
left
her
eyes
affected
.
The
doctor
had
taken
her
home
*NL*
to
attend
to
them
.
My
children
had
always
been
afraid
of
the
doctor
and
his
*NL*
wife
.
They
had
never
been
inside
of
their
house
.
Poor
little
Ellen
cried
*NL*
all
day
to
be
carried
back
to
prison
.
The
instincts
of
childhood
are
true
.
*NL*
She
knew
she
was
loved
in
the
jail
.
Her
screams
and
sobs
annoyed
Mrs.
*NL*
Flint
.
Before
night
she
called
one
of
the
slaves
,
and
said
,
``
Here
,
Bill
,
*NL*
carry
this
brat
back
to
the
jail
.
I
ca
n't
stand
her
noise
.
If
she
would
be
*NL*
quiet
I
should
like
to
keep
the
little
minx
.
She
would
make
a
handy
*NL*
waiting-maid
for
my
daughter
by
and
by
.
But
if
she
staid
here
,
with
her
*NL*
white
face
,
I
suppose
I
should
either
kill
her
or
spoil
her
.
I
hope
the
*NL*
doctor
will
sell
them
as
far
as
wind
and
water
can
carry
them
.
As
for
their
*NL*
mother
,
her
ladyship
will
find
out
yet
what
she
gets
by
running
away
.
She
*NL*
has
n't
so
much
feeling
for
her
children
as
a
cow
has
for
its
calf
.
If
she
*NL*
had
,
she
would
have
come
back
long
ago
,
to
get
them
out
of
jail
,
and
save
*NL*
all
this
expense
and
trouble
.
The
good-for-nothing
hussy
!
When
she
is
*NL*
caught
,
she
shall
stay
in
jail
,
in
irons
,
for
one
six
months
,
and
then
be
*NL*
sold
to
a
sugar
plantation
.
I
shall
see
her
broke
in
yet
.
What
do
you
stand
*NL*
there
for
,
Bill
?
Why
do
n't
you
go
off
with
the
brat
?
Mind
,
now
,
that
you
*NL*
do
n't
let
any
of
the
niggers
speak
to
her
in
the
street
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
these
remarks
were
reported
to
me
,
I
smiled
at
Mrs.
Flint
's
saying
*NL*
that
she
should
either
kill
my
child
or
spoil
her
.
I
thought
to
myself
*NL*
there
was
very
little
danger
of
the
latter
.
I
have
always
considered
it
as
*NL*
one
of
God
's
special
providences
that
Ellen
screamed
till
she
was
carried
*NL*
back
to
jail
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
same
night
Dr.
Flint
was
called
to
a
patient
,
and
did
not
return
till
*NL*
near
morning
.
Passing
my
grandmother
's
,
he
saw
a
light
in
the
house
,
and
*NL*
thought
to
himself
,
``
Perhaps
this
has
something
to
do
with
Linda
.
''
He
*NL*
knocked
,
and
the
door
was
opened
.
``
What
calls
you
up
so
early
?
''
said
he
.
``
I
*NL*
saw
your
light
,
and
I
thought
I
would
just
stop
and
tell
you
that
I
have
*NL*
found
out
where
Linda
is
.
I
know
where
to
put
my
hands
on
her
,
and
I
shall
*NL*
have
her
before
twelve
o'clock
.
''
When
he
had
turned
away
,
my
grandmother
*NL*
and
my
uncle
looked
anxiously
at
each
other
.
They
did
not
know
whether
or
*NL*
not
it
was
merely
one
of
the
doctor
's
tricks
to
frighten
them
.
In
their
*NL*
uncertainty
,
they
thought
it
was
best
to
have
a
message
conveyed
to
my
*NL*
friend
Betty
.
Unwilling
to
alarm
her
mistress
,
Betty
resolved
to
dispose
of
*NL*
me
herself
.
She
came
to
me
,
and
told
me
to
rise
and
dress
quickly
.
We
*NL*
hurried
down
stairs
,
and
across
the
yard
,
into
the
kitchen
.
She
locked
the
*NL*
door
,
and
lifted
up
a
plank
in
the
floor
.
A
buffalo
skin
and
a
bit
of
*NL*
carpet
were
spread
for
me
to
lie
on
,
and
a
quilt
thrown
over
me
.
``
Stay
*NL*
dar
,
''
said
she
,
``
till
I
sees
if
dey
know
`
bout
you
.
Dey
say
dey
vil
put
*NL*
thar
hans
on
you

twelve
o'clock

If

Dey

time

Dat
's
all
I
got
to
say
.
If
*NL*

_
my
_
tings
,
de
'll
get
one
bressed
sarssin
from
dis
*NL*
`
ere

.
''
In
my
shallow
bed
I
had
but
just
room
enough
to
bring
my
*NL*
hands
to
my
face
to
keep
the
dust
out
of
my
eyes
;
for
Betty
walked
over
me
*NL*
twenty
times
in
an
hour
,
passing
from
the
dresser
to
the
fireplace
.
When
*NL*
she
was
alone
,
I
could
hear
her
pronouncing
anathemas
over
Dr.
Flint
and
*NL*
all
his
tribe
,
every
now
and
then
saying
,
with
a
chuckling
laugh
,
``
Dis
*NL*
nigger
's
too
cute
for
'em
dis
time
.
''
When
the
housemaids
were
about
,
she
*NL*
had
sly
ways
of
drawing
them
out
,
that
I
might
hear
what
they
would
say
.
*NL*
She
would
repeat
stories
she
had
heard
about
my
being
in
this
,
or
that
,
or
*NL*
the
other
place
.
To
which
they
would
answer
,
that
I
was
not
fool
enough
to
*NL*
be
staying
round
there
;
that
I
was
in
Philadelphia
or
New
York
before
this
*NL*
time
.
When
all
were
abed
and
asleep
,
Betty
raised
the
plank
,
and
said
,
*NL*
``
Come
out
,
chile
;
come
out
.
Dey
do
n't
know
nottin
`
bout
you
.
Twas
only
*NL*
white
folks

lies

to
skeer
de
niggers

''
*NL*
*NL*
Some
days
after
this
adventure
I
had
a
much
worse
fright
.
As
I
sat
very
*NL*
still
in
my
retreat
above
stairs
,
cheerful
visions
floated
through
my
mind
.
*NL*
I
thought
Dr.
Flint
would
soon
get
discouraged
,
and
would
be
willing
to
*NL*
sell
my
children
,
when
he
lost
all
hopes
of
making
them
the
means
of
my
*NL*
discovery
.
I
knew
who
was
ready
to
buy
them
.
Suddenly
I
heard
a
voice
that
*NL*
chilled
my
blood
.
The
sound
was
too
familiar
to
me
,
it
had
been
too
*NL*
dreadful
,
for
me
not
to
recognize
at
once
my
old
master
.
He
was
in
the
*NL*
house
,
and
I
at
once
concluded
he
had
come
to
seize
me
.
I
looked
round
in
*NL*
terror
.
There
was
no
way
of
escape
.
The
voice
receded
.
I
supposed
the
*NL*
constable
was
with
him
,
and
they
were
searching
the
house
.
In
my
alarm
I
*NL*
did
not
forget
the
trouble
I
was
bringing
on
my
generous
benefactress
.
It
*NL*
seemed
as
if
I
were
born
to
bring
sorrow
on
all
who
befriended
me
,
and
that
*NL*
was
the
bitterest
drop
in
the
bitter
cup
of
my
life
.
After
a
while
I
heard
*NL*
approaching
footsteps
;
the
key
was
turned
in
my
door
.
I
braced
myself
*NL*
against
the
wall
to
keep
from
falling
.
I
ventured
to
look
up
,
and
there
*NL*
stood
my
kind
benefactress
alone
.
I
was
too
much
overcome
to
speak
,
and
*NL*
sunk
down
upon
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
would
hear
your
master
's
voice
,
''
she
said
;
``
and
knowing
you
*NL*
would
be
terrified
,
I
came
to
tell
you
there
is
nothing
to
fear
.
You
may
*NL*
even
indulge
in
a
laugh
at
the
old
gentleman
's
expense
.
He
is
so
sure
you
*NL*
are
in
New
York
,
that
he
came
to
borrow
five
hundred
dollars
to
go
in
*NL*
pursuit
of
you
.
My
sister
had
some
money
to
loan
on
interest
.
He
has
*NL*
obtained
it
,
and
proposes
to
start
for
New
York
to-night
.
So
,
for
the
*NL*
present
,
you
see
you
are
safe
.
The
doctor
will
merely
lighten
his
pocket
*NL*
hunting
after
the
bird
he
has
left
behind

The
Children
Sold
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
Doctor
came
back
from
New
York
,
of
course
without
accomplishing
his
*NL*
purpose
.
He
had
expended
considerable
money
,
and
was
rather
disheartened
.
*NL*
My
brother
and
the
children
had
now
been
in
jail
two
months
,
and
that
also
*NL*
was
some
expense
.
My
friends
thought
it
was
a
favorable
time
to
work
on
his
*NL*
discouraged
feelings
.
Mr.
Sands
sent
a
speculator
to
offer
him
nine
hundred
*NL*
dollars
for
my
brother
William
,
and
eight
hundred
for
the
two
children
.
*NL*
These
were
high
prices
,
as
slaves
were
then
selling
;
but
the
offer
was
*NL*
rejected
.
If
it
had
been
merely
a
question
of
money
,
the
doctor
would
have
*NL*
sold
any
boy
of
Benny
's
age
for
two
hundred
dollars
;
but
he
could
not
bear
*NL*
to
give
up
the
power
of
revenge
.
But
he
was
hard
pressed
for
money
,
and
he
*NL*
revolved
the
matter
in
his
mind
.
He
knew
that
if
he
could
keep
Ellen
till
*NL*
she
was
fifteen
,
he
could
sell
her
for
a
high
price
;
but
I
presume
he
*NL*
reflected
that
she
might
die
,
or
might
be
stolen
away
.
At
all
events
,
he
*NL*
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
had
better
accept
the
slave-trader
's
offer
.
*NL*
Meeting
him
in
the
street
,
he
inquired
when
he
would
leave
town
.
``
To-day
,
*NL*
at
ten
o'clock
,
''
he
replied
.
``
Ah
,
do
you
go
so
soon
?
''
said
the
doctor
.
``
I
*NL*
have
been
reflecting
upon
your
proposition
,
and
I
have
concluded
to
let
you
*NL*
have
the
three
negroes
if
you
will
say
nineteen
hundred
dollars
.
''
After
*NL*
some
parley
,
the
trader
agreed
to
his
terms
.
He
wanted
the
bill
of
sale
*NL*
drawn
up
and
signed
immediately
,
as
he
had
a
great
deal
to
attend
to
during
*NL*
the
short
time
he
remained
in
town
.
The
doctor
went
to
the
jail
and
told
*NL*
William
he
would
take
him
back
into
his
service
if
he
would
promise
to
*NL*
behave
himself
but
he
replied
that
he
would
rather
be
sold
.
``
And
you
*NL*
_
shall
_
be
sold
,
you
ungrateful
rascal
!
''
exclaimed
the
doctor
.
In
less
than
*NL*
an
hour
the
money
was
paid
,
the
papers
were
signed
,
sealed
,
and
delivered
,
*NL*
and
my
brother
and
children
were
in
the
hands
of
the
trader
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
hurried
transaction
;
and
after
it
was
over
,
the
doctor
's
*NL*
characteristic
caution
returned
.
He
went
back
to
the
speculator
,
and
said
,
*NL*
``
Sir
,
I
have
come
to
lay
you
under
obligations
of
a
thousand
dollars
not
to
*NL*
sell
any
of
those
negroes
in
this
state
.
''
``
You
come
too
late
,
''
replied
the
*NL*
trader
;
``
our
bargain
is
closed
.
''
He
had
,
in
fact
,
already
sold
them
to
Mr.
*NL*
Sands
,
but
he
did
not
mention
it
.
The
doctor
required
him
to
put
irons
on
*NL*
``
that
rascal
,
Bill
,
''
and
to
pass
through
the
back
streets
when
he
took
his
*NL*
gang
out
of
town
.
The
trader
was
privately
instructed
to
concede
to
his
*NL*
wishes
.
My
good
old
aunt
went
to
the
jail
to
bid
the
children
good
by
,
*NL*
supposing
them
to
be
the
speculator
's
property
,
and
that
she
should
never
*NL*
see
them
again
.
As
she
held
Benny
in
her
lap
,
he
said
,
``
Aunt
Nancy
,
I
want
*NL*
to
show
you
something
.
''
He
led
her
to
the
door
and
showed
her
a
long
row
of
*NL*
marks
,
saying
,
``
Uncle
Will
taught
me
to
count
.
I
have
made
a
mark
for
every
*NL*
day
I
have
been
here
,
and
it
is
sixty
days
.
It
is
a
long
time
;
and
the
*NL*
speculator
is
going
to
take
me
and
Ellen
away
.
He
's
a
bad
man
.
It
's
wrong
*NL*
for
him
to
take
grandmother
's
children
.
I
want
to
go
to
my
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
grandmother
was
told
that
the
children
would
be
restored
to
her
,
but
she
*NL*
was
requested
to
act
as
if
they
were
really
to
be
sent
away
.
Accordingly
,
*NL*
she
made
up
a
bundle
of
clothes
and
went
to
the
jail
.
When
she
arrived
,
she
*NL*
found
William
handcuffed
among
the
gang
,
and
the
children
in
the
trader
's
*NL*
cart
.
The
scene
seemed
too
much
like
reality
.
She
was
afraid
there
might
*NL*
have
been
some
deception
or
mistake
.
She
fainted
,
and
was
carried
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
wagon
stopped
at
the
hotel
,
several
gentlemen
came
out
and
*NL*
proposed
to
purchase
William
,
but
the
trader
refused
their
offers
,
without
*NL*
stating
that
he
was
already
sold
.
And
now
came
the
trying
hour
for
that
*NL*
drove
of
human
beings
,
driven
away
like
cattle
,
to
be
sold
they
knew
not
*NL*
where
.
Husbands
were
torn
from
wives
,
parents
from
children
,
never
to
look
*NL*
upon
each
other
again
this
side
the
grave
.
There
was
wringing
of
hands
and
*NL*
cries
of
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Flint
had
the
supreme
satisfaction
of
seeing
the
wagon
leave
town
,
and
*NL*
Mrs.
Flint
had
the
gratification
of
supposing
that
my
children
were
going
*NL*
``
as
far
as
wind
and
water
would
carry
them
.
''
According
to
agreement
,
my
*NL*
uncle
followed
the
wagon
some
miles
,
until
they
came
to
an
old
farm
house
.
*NL*
There
the
trader
took
the
irons
from
William
,
and
as
he
did
so
,
he
said
,
*NL*
``
You
are
a
damned
clever
fellow
.
I
should
like
to
own
you
myself
.
Them
*NL*
gentlemen
that
wanted
to
buy
you
said
you
was
a
bright
,
honest
chap
,
and
I
*NL*
must
git
you
a
good
home
.
I
guess
your
old
master
will
swear
to-morrow
,
and
*NL*
call
himself
an
old
fool
for
selling
the
children
.
I
reckon
he
'll
never
git
*NL*
their
mammy
back
again
.
I
expect
she
's
made
tracks
for
the
north
.
Good
by
,
*NL*
old
boy
.
Remember
,
I
have
done
you
a
good
turn
.
You
must
thank
me
by
*NL*
coaxing
all
the
pretty
gals
to
go
with
me
next
fall
.
That
's
going
to
be
my
*NL*
last
trip
.
This
trading
in
niggers
is
a
bad
business
for
a
fellow
that
's
*NL*
got
any
heart
.
Move
on
,
you
fellows
!
''
And
the
gang
went
on
,
God
alone
knows
*NL*
where
.
*NL*
*NL*
Much
as
I
despise
and
detest
the
class
of
slave-traders
,
whom
I
regard
as
*NL*
the
vilest
wretches
on
earth
,
I
must
do
this
man
the
justice
to
say
that
he
*NL*
seemed
to
have
some
feeling
.
He
took
a
fancy
to
William
in
the
jail
,
and
*NL*
wanted
to
buy
him
.
When
he
heard
the
story
of
my
children
,
he
was
willing
*NL*
to
aid
them
in
getting
out
of
Dr.
Flint
's
power
,
even
without
charging
the
*NL*
customary
fee
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
uncle
procured
a
wagon
and
carried
William
and
the
children
back
to
*NL*
town
.
Great
was
the
joy
in
my
grandmother
's
house
!
The
curtains
were
*NL*
closed
,
and
the
candles
lighted
.
The
happy
grandmother
cuddled
the
little
*NL*
ones
to
her
bosom
.
They
hugged
her
,
and
kissed
her
,
and
clapped
their
*NL*
hands
,
and
shouted
.
She
knelt
down
and
poured
forth
one
of
her
heartfelt
*NL*
prayers
of
thanksgiving
to
God
.
The
father
was
present
for
a
while
;
and
*NL*
though
such
a
``
parental
relation
''
as
existed
between
him
and
my
children
*NL*
takes
slight
hold
on
the
hearts
or
consciences
of
slaveholders
,
it
must
be
*NL*
that
he
experienced
some
moments
of
pure
joy
in
witnessing
the
happiness
he
*NL*
had
imparted
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
no
share
in
the
rejoicings
of
that
evening
.
The
events
of
the
day
had
*NL*
not
come
to
my
knowledge
.
And
now
I
will
tell
you
something
that
happened
*NL*
to
me
;
though
you
will
,
perhaps
,
think
it
illustrates
the
superstition
of
*NL*
slaves
.
I
sat
in
my
usual
place
on
the
floor
near
the
window
,
where
I
could
*NL*
hear
much
that
was
said
in
the
street
without
being
seen
.
The
family
had
*NL*
retired
for
the
night
,
and
all
was
still
.
I
sat
there
thinking
of
my
*NL*
children
,
when
I
heard
a
low
strain
of
music
.
A
band
of
serenaders
were
*NL*
under
the
window
,
playing
``
Home
,
sweet
home
.
''
I
listened
till
the
sounds
*NL*
did
not
seem
like
music
,
but
like
the
moaning
of
children
.
It
seemed
as
if
*NL*
my
heart
would
burst
.
I
rose
from
my
sitting
posture
,
and
knelt
.
A
streak
*NL*
of
moonlight
was
on
the
floor
before
me
,
and
in
the
midst
of
it
appeared
*NL*
the
forms
of
my
two
children
.
They
vanished
;
but
I
had
seen
them
*NL*
distinctly
.
Some
will
call
it
a
dream
,
others
a
vision
.
I
know
not
how
to
*NL*
account
for
it
,
but
it
made
a
strong
impression
on
my
mind
,
and
I
felt
*NL*
certain
something
had
happened
to
my
little
ones
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
not
seen
Betty
since
morning
.
Now
I
heard
her
softly
turning
the
key
.
*NL*
As
soon
as
she
entered
,
I
clung
to
her
,
and
begged
her
to
let
me
know
*NL*
whether
my
children
were
dead
,
or
whether
they
were
sold
;
for
I
had
seen
*NL*
their
spirits
in
my
room
,
and
I
was
sure
something
had
happened
to
them
.
*NL*
``
Lor
,
chile
,
''
said
she
,
putting
her
arms
round
me
,
``
you
's
got
de
*NL*
high-sterics
.
I
'll
sleep
wid
you
to-night
,
'cause
you
'll
make
a
noise
,
and
*NL*
ruin
missis
.
Something
has
stirred
you
up
mightily
.
When
you
is
done
cryin
,
*NL*
I
'll
talk
wid
you
.
De
chillern

well
,
and
mighty
happy
.
I
seed
'em
*NL*
myself
.
Does
dat
satisfy
you
?
Dar
,
chile
,
be
still
!
Somebody
vill
hear
*NL*
you
.
''
I
tried
to
obey
her
.
She
lay
down
,
and
was
soon
sound
asleep
;
but
no
*NL*
sleep
would
come
to
my
eyelids
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
dawn
,
Betty
was
up
and
off
to
the
kitchen
.
The
hours
passed
on
,
and
the
*NL*
vision
of
the
night
kept
constantly
recurring
to
my
thoughts
.
After
a
while
*NL*
I
heard
the
voices
of
two
women
in
the
entry
.
In
one
of
them
I
recognized
*NL*
the
housemaid
.
The
other
said
to
her
,
``
Did
you
know
Linda
Brent
's
children
*NL*
was
sold
to
the
speculator
yesterday
.
They
say
ole
massa
Flint
was
mighty
*NL*
glad
to
see
'em
drove
out
of
town
;
but
they
say
they
've
come
back
agin
.
I
*NL*
`
spect

all
their

's
doings
.
They
say

.
*NL*

I

going
roun

to
aunt
*NL*
Marthy
's
to
see
`
bout
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
bit
my
lips
till
the
blood
came
to
keep
from
crying
out
.
Were
my
children
*NL*
with
their
grandmother
,
or
had
the
speculator
carried
them
off
?
The
*NL*
suspense
was
dreadful
.
Would
Betty
_
never
_
come
,
and
tell
me
the
truth
*NL*
about
it
?
At
last
she
came
,
and
I
eagerly
repeated
what
I
had
overheard
.
*NL*
Her
face
was
one
broad
,
bright
smile
.
``
Lor
,
you
foolish
ting
!
''
said
she
.
*NL*
``
I
`
se
gwine
to
tell
you
all
`
bout

.
De

and

''
*NL*
*NL*
Betty
went
off
laughing
;
and
I
said
to
myself
,
``
Can
it
be
true
that
my
*NL*
children
are
free
?
I
have
not
suffered
for
them
in
vain
.
Thank
God
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Great
surprise
was
expressed
when
it
was
known
that
my
children
had
*NL*
returned
to
their
grandmother
's
.
The
news
spread
through
the
town
,
and
many
*NL*
a
kind
word
was
bestowed
on
the
little
ones
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Flint
went
to
my
grandmother
's
to
ascertain
who
was
the
owner
of
my
*NL*
children
,
and
she
informed
him
.
``
I
expected
as
much
,
''
said
he
.
``
I
am
glad
*NL*
to
hear
it
.
I
have
had
news
from
Linda
lately
,
and
I
shall
soon
have
her
.
*NL*
You
need
never
expect
to
see
_
her
_
free
.
She
shall
be
my
slave
as
long
as
I
*NL*
live
,
and
when
I
am
dead
she
shall
be
the
slave
of
my
children
.
If
I
ever
*NL*
find
out
that
you
or
Phillip
had
anything
to
do
with
her
running
off
I
'll
*NL*
kill
him
.
And
if
I
meet
William
in
the
street
,
and
he
presumes
to
look
at
*NL*
me
,
I
'll
flog
him
within
an
inch
of
his
life
.
Keep
those
brats
out
of
my
*NL*
sight
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
turned
to
leave
,
my
grandmother
said
something
to
remind
him
of
his
*NL*
own
doings
.
He
looked
back
upon
her
,
as
if
he
would
have
been
glad
to
*NL*
strike
her
to
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
my
season
of
joy
and
thanksgiving
.
It
was
the
first
time
since
my
*NL*
childhood
that
I
had
experienced
any
real
happiness
.
I
heard
of
the
old
*NL*
doctor
's
threats
,
but
they
no
longer
had
the
same
power
to
trouble
me
.
The
*NL*
darkest
cloud
that
hung
over
my
life
had
rolled
away
.
Whatever
slavery
*NL*
might
do
to
me
,
it
could
not
shackle
my
children
.
If
I
fell
a
sacrifice
,
my
*NL*
little
ones
were
saved
.
It
was
well
for
me
that
my
simple
heart
believed
*NL*
all
that
had
been
promised
for
their
welfare
.
It
is
always
better
to
trust
*NL*
than
to
doubt
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XX
.
New
Perils
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
,
more
exasperated
than
ever
,
again
tried
to
revenge
himself
on
*NL*
my
relatives
.
He
arrested
uncle
Phillip
on
the
charge
of
having
aided
my
*NL*
flight
.
He
was
carried
before
a
court
,
and
swore
truly
that
he
knew
nothing
*NL*
of
my
intention
to
escape
,
and
that
he
had
not
seen
me
since
I
left
my
*NL*
master
's
plantation
.
The
doctor
then
demanded
that
he
should
give
bail
for
*NL*
five
hundred
dollars
that
he
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
me
.
Several
*NL*
gentlemen
offered
to
be
security
for
him
;
but
Mr.
Sands
told
him
he
had
*NL*
better
go
back
to
jail
,
and
he
would
see
that
he
came
out
without
giving
*NL*
bail
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
news
of
his
arrest
was
carried
to
my
grandmother
,
who
conveyed
it
to
*NL*
Betty
.
In
the
kindness
of
her
heart
,
she
again
stowed
me
away
under
the
*NL*
floor
;
and
as
she
walked
back
and
forth
,
in
the
performance
of
her
culinary
*NL*
duties
,
she
talked
apparently
to
herself
,
but
with
the
intention
that
I
*NL*
should
hear
what
was
going
on
.
I
hoped
that
my
uncle
's
imprisonment
would
*NL*
last
but
few
days
;
still
I
was
anxious
.
I
thought
it
likely
Dr.
Flint
would
*NL*
do
his
utmost
to
taunt
and
insult
him
,
and
I
was
afraid
my
uncle
might
lose
*NL*
control
of
himself
,
and
retort
in
some
way
that
would
be
construed
into
a
*NL*
punishable
offence
;
and
I
was
well
aware
that
in
court
his
word
would
not
*NL*
be
taken
against
any
white
man
's
.
The
search
for
me
was
renewed
.
Something
*NL*
had
excited
suspicions
that
I
was
in
the
vicinity
.
They
searched
the
house
*NL*
I
was
in
.
I
heard
their
steps
and
their
voices
.
At
night
,
when
all
were
*NL*
asleep
,
Betty
came
to
release
me
from
my
place
of
confinement
.
The
fright
I
*NL*
had
undergone
,
the
constrained
posture
,
and
the
dampness
of
the
ground
,
*NL*
made
me
ill
for
several
days
.
My
uncle
was
soon
after
taken
out
of
prison
;
*NL*
but
the
movements
of
all
my
relatives
,
and
of
all
our
friends
,
were
very
*NL*
closely
watched
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
all
saw
that
I
could
not
remain
where
I
was
much
longer
.
I
had
already
*NL*
staid
longer
than
was
intended
,
and
I
knew
my
presence
must
be
a
source
of
*NL*
perpetual
anxiety
to
my
kind
benefactress
.
During
this
time
,
my
friends
had
*NL*
laid
many
plans
for
my
escape
,
but
the
extreme
vigilance
of
my
persecutors
*NL*
made
it
impossible
to
carry
them
into
effect
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
I
was
much
startled
by
hearing
somebody
trying
to
get
into
my
*NL*
room
.
Several
keys
were
tried
,
but
none
fitted
.
I
instantly
conjectured
it
*NL*
was
one
of
the
housemaids
;
and
I
concluded
she
must
either
have
heard
some
*NL*
noise
in
the
room
,
or
have
noticed
the
entrance
of
Betty
.
When
my
friend
*NL*
came
,
at
her
usual
time
,
I
told
her
what
had
happened
.
``
I
knows
who
it
*NL*
was
,
''
said
she
.
``
Tend
upon
it
,
't
was
dat
Jenny
.
Dat
nigger
allers
got
de
*NL*
debble
in
her
.
''
I
suggested
that
she
might
have
seen
or
heard
something
*NL*
that
excited
her
curiosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tut
!
tut
!
chile
!
''
exclaimed
Betty
,
``
she
ai
n't
seen
notin
'
,
nor
hearn
*NL*
notin
'
.
She
only
`
spects
something
.
Dat
's
all
.
She
wants
to
fine
out
who
*NL*
hab
cut
and
make
my
gownd
.
But
she
wo
n't
nebber
know
.
Dat
's
sartin
.
I
'll
*NL*
git
missis
to
fix
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
reflected
a
moment
,
and
said
,
``
Betty
,
I
must
leave
here
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
as
you
tink
best
,
poor
chile
,
''
she
replied
.
``
I
`
se
mighty
`
fraid
dat
*NL*
`
ere
nigger
vill
pop
on
you
some
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
reported
the
incident
to
her
mistress
,
and
received
orders
to
keep
*NL*
Jenny
busy
in
the
kitchen
till
she
could
see
my
uncle
Phillip
.
He
told
her
*NL*
he
would
send
a
friend
for
me
that
very
evening
.
She
told
him
she
hoped
I
*NL*
was
going
to
the
north
,
for
it
was
very
dangerous
for
me
to
remain
any
*NL*
where
in
the
vicinity
.
Alas
,
it
was
not
an
easy
thing
,
for
one
in
my
*NL*
situation
,
to
go
to
the
north
.
In
order
to
leave
the
coast
quite
clear
for
*NL*
me
,
she
went
into
the
country
to
spend
the
day
with
her
brother
,
and
took
*NL*
Jenny
with
her
.
She
was
afraid
to
come
and
bid
me
good
by
,
but
she
left
a
*NL*
kind
message
with
Betty
.
I
heard
her
carriage
roll
from
the
door
,
and
I
*NL*
never
again
saw
her
who
had
so
generously
befriended
the
poor
,
trembling
*NL*
fugitive
!
Though
she
was
a
slaveholder
,
to
this
day
my
heart
blesses
her
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
not
the
slightest
idea
where
I
was
going
.
Betty
brought
me
a
suit
of
*NL*
sailor
's
clothes
,
--
jacket
,
trowsers
,
and
tarpaulin
hat
.
She
gave
me
a
small
*NL*
bundle
,
saying
I
might
need
it
where
I
was
going
.
In
cheery
tones
,
she
*NL*
exclaimed
,
``
I
`
se
_
so
_
glad
you
is
gwine
to
free
parts
!
Do
n't
forget
ole
*NL*
Betty
.
P'raps
I
'll
come
`
long
by
and
by
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
tried
to
tell
her
how
grateful
I
felt
for
all
her
kindness
.
But
she
*NL*
interrupted
me
.
``
I
do
n't
want
no
tanks
,
honey
.
I
`
se
glad
I
could
help
you
,
*NL*
and
I
hope
de
good
Lord
vill
open
de
path
for
you
.
I
`
se
gwine
wid
you
to
de
*NL*
lower
gate
.
Put
your
hands
in
your
pockets
,
and
walk
ricketty
,
like
de
*NL*
sailors
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
performed
to
her
satisfaction
.
At
the
gate
I
found
Peter
,
a
young
colored
*NL*
man
,
waiting
for
me
.
I
had
known
him
for
years
.
He
had
been
an
apprentice
*NL*
to
my
father
,
and
had
always
borne
a
good
character
.
I
was
not
afraid
to
*NL*
trust
to
him
.
Betty
bade
me
a
hurried
good
by
,
and
we
walked
off
.
``
Take
*NL*
courage
,
Linda
,
''
said
my
friend
Peter
.
``
I
've
got
a
dagger
,
and
no
man
shall
*NL*
take
you
from
me
,
unless
he
passes
over
my
dead
body
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
long
time
since
I
had
taken
a
walk
out
of
doors
,
and
the
fresh
air
*NL*
revived
me
.
It
was
also
pleasant
to
hear
a
human
voice
speaking
to
me
above
*NL*
a
whisper
.
I
passed
several
people
whom
I
knew
,
but
they
did
not
recognize
*NL*
me
in
my
disguise
.
I
prayed
internally
that
,
for
Peter
's
sake
,
as
well
as
*NL*
my
own
,
nothing
might
occur
to
bring
out
his
dagger
.
We
walked
on
till
we
*NL*
came
to
the
wharf
.
My
aunt
Nancy
's
husband
was
a
seafaring
man
,
and
it
had
*NL*
been
deemed
necessary
to
let
him
into
our
secret
.
He
took
me
into
his
boat
,
*NL*
rowed
out
to
a
vessel
not
far
distant
,
and
hoisted
me
on
board
.
We
three
*NL*
were
the
only
occupants
of
the
vessel
.
I
now
ventured
to
ask
what
they
*NL*
proposed
to
do
with
me
.
They
said
I
was
to
remain
on
board
till
near
dawn
,
*NL*
and
then
they
would
hide
me
in
Snaky
Swamp
,
till
my
uncle
Phillip
had
*NL*
prepared
a
place
of
concealment
for
me
.
If
the
vessel
had
been
bound
north
,
*NL*
it
would
have
been
of
no
avail
to
me
,
for
it
would
certainly
have
been
*NL*
searched
.
About
four
o'clock
,
we
were
again
seated
in
the
boat
,
and
rowed
*NL*
three
miles
to
the
swamp
.
My
fear
of
snakes
had
been
increased
by
the
*NL*
venomous
bite
I
had
received
,
and
I
dreaded
to
enter
this
hiding
place
.
But
*NL*
I
was
in
no
situation
to
choose
,
and
I
gratefully
accepted
the
best
that
my
*NL*
poor
,
persecuted
friends
could
do
for
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Peter
landed
first
,
and
with
a
large
knife
cut
a
path
through
bamboos
and
*NL*
briers
of
all
descriptions
.
He
came
back
,
took
me
in
his
arms
,
and
carried
*NL*
me
to
a
seat
made
among
the
bamboos
.
Before
we
reached
it
,
we
were
covered
*NL*
with
hundreds
of
mosquitos
.
In
an
hour
's
time
they
had
so
poisoned
my
flesh
*NL*
that
I
was
a
pitiful
sight
to
behold
.
As
the
light
increased
,
I
saw
snake
*NL*
after
snake
crawling
round
us
.
I
had
been
accustomed
to
the
sight
of
snakes
*NL*
all
my
life
,
but
these
were
larger
than
any
I
had
ever
seen
.
To
this
day
I
*NL*
shudder
when
I
remember
that
morning
.
As
evening
approached
,
the
number
of
*NL*
snakes
increased
so
much
that
we
were
continually
obliged
to
thrash
them
*NL*
with
sticks
to
keep
them
from
crawling
over
us
.
The
bamboos
were
so
high
*NL*
and
so
thick
that
it
was
impossible
to
see
beyond
a
very
short
distance
.
*NL*
Just
before
it
became
dark
we
procured
a
seat
nearer
to
the
entrance
of
the
*NL*
swamp
,
being
fearful
of
losing
our
way
back
to
the
boat
.
It
was
not
long
*NL*
before
we
heard
the
paddle
of
oars
,
and
the
low
whistle
,
which
had
been
*NL*
agreed
upon
as
a
signal
.
We
made
haste
to
enter
the
boat
,
and
were
rowed
*NL*
back
to
the
vessel
.
I
passed
a
wretched
night
;
for
the
heat
of
the
swamp
,
*NL*
the
mosquitos
,
and
the
constant
terror
of
snakes
,
had
brought
on
a
burning
*NL*
fever
.
I
had
just
dropped
asleep
,
when
they
came
and
told
me
it
was
time
to
*NL*
go
back
to
that
horrid
swamp
.
I
could
scarcely
summon
courage
to
rise
.
But
*NL*
even
those
large
,
venomous
snakes
were
less
dreadful
to
my
imagination
than
*NL*
the
white
men
in
that
community
called
civilized
.
This
time
Peter
took
a
*NL*
quantity
of
tobacco
to
burn
,
to
keep
off
the
mosquitos
.
It
produced
the
*NL*
desired
effect
on
them
,
but
gave
me
nausea
and
severe
headache
.
At
dark
we
*NL*
returned
to
the
vessel
.
I
had
been
so
sick
during
the
day
,
that
Peter
*NL*
declared
I
should
go
home
that
night
,
if
the
devil
himself
was
on
patrol
.
*NL*
They
told
me
a
place
of
concealment
had
been
provided
for
me
at
my
*NL*
grandmother
's
.
I
could
not
imagine
how
it
was
possible
to
hide
me
in
her
*NL*
house
,
every
nook
and
corner
of
which
was
known
to
the
Flint
family
.
They
*NL*
told
me
to
wait
and
see
.
We
were
rowed
ashore
,
and
went
boldly
through
the
*NL*
streets
,
to
my
grandmother
's
.
I
wore
my
sailor
's
clothes
,
and
had
blackened
*NL*
my
face
with
charcoal
.
I
passed
several
people
whom
I
knew
.
The
father
of
*NL*
my
children
came
so
near
that
I
brushed
against
his
arm
;
but
he
had
no
idea
*NL*
who
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
make
the
most
of
this
walk
,
''
said
my
friend
Peter
,
``
for
you
may
*NL*
not
have
another
very
soon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
his
voice
sounded
sad
.
It
was
kind
of
him
to
conceal
from
me
what
*NL*
a
dismal
hole
was
to
be
my
home
for
a
long
,
long
time
.

The
Loophole
Of
Retreat
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
small
shed
had
been
added
to
my
grandmother
's
house
years
ago
.
Some
*NL*
boards
were
laid
across
the
joists
at
the
top
,
and
between
these
boards
and
*NL*
the
roof
was
a
very
small
garret
,
never
occupied
by
any
thing
but
rats
and
*NL*
mice
.
It
was
a
pent
roof
,
covered
with
nothing
but
shingles
,
according
to
*NL*
the
southern
custom
for
such
buildings
.
The
garret
was
only
nine
feet
long
*NL*
and
seven
wide
.
The
highest
part
was
three
feet
high
,
and
sloped
down
*NL*
abruptly
to
the
loose
board
floor
.
There
was
no
admission
for
either
light
*NL*
or
air
.
My
uncle
Phillip
,
who
was
a
carpenter
,
had
very
skilfully
made
a
*NL*
concealed
trap-door
,
which
communicated
with
the
storeroom
.
He
had
been
*NL*
doing
this
while
I
was
waiting
in
the
swamp
.
The
storeroom
opened
upon
a
*NL*
piazza
.
To
this
hole
I
was
conveyed
as
soon
as
I
entered
the
house
.
The
air
*NL*
was
stifling
;
the
darkness
total
.
A
bed
had
been
spread
on
the
floor
.
I
*NL*
could
sleep
quite
comfortably
on
one
side
;
but
the
slope
was
so
sudden
that
*NL*
I
could
not
turn
on
my
other
without
hitting
the
roof
.
The
rats
and
mice
*NL*
ran
over
my
bed
;
but
I
was
weary
,
and
I
slept
such
sleep
as
the
wretched
*NL*
may
,
when
a
tempest
has
passed
over
them
.
Morning
came
.
I
knew
it
only
by
*NL*
the
noises
I
heard
;
for
in
my
small
den
day
and
night
were
all
the
same
.
I
*NL*
suffered
for
air
even
more
than
for
light
.
But
I
was
not
comfortless
.
I
*NL*
heard
the
voices
of
my
children
.
There
was
joy
and
there
was
sadness
in
the
*NL*
sound
.
It
made
my
tears
flow
.
How
I
longed
to
speak
to
them
!
I
was
eager
to
*NL*
look
on
their
faces
;
but
there
was
no
hole
,
no
crack
,
through
which
I
could
*NL*
peep
.
This
continued
darkness
was
oppressive
.
It
seemed
horrible
to
sit
or
*NL*
lie
in
a
cramped
position
day
after
day
,
without
one
gleam
of
light
.
Yet
I
*NL*
would
have
chosen
this
,
rather
than
my
lot
as
a
slave
,
though
white
people
*NL*
considered
it
an
easy
one
;
and
it
was
so
compared
with
the
fate
of
others
.
*NL*
I
was
never
cruelly
overworked
;
I
was
never
lacerated
with
the
whip
from
*NL*
head
to
foot
;
I
was
never
so
beaten
and
bruised
that
I
could
not
turn
from
*NL*
one
side
to
the
other
;
I
never
had
my
heel-strings
cut
to
prevent
my
*NL*
running
away
;
I
was
never
chained
to
a
log
and
forced
to
drag
it
about
,
*NL*
while
I
toiled
in
the
fields
from
morning
till
night
;
I
was
never
branded
*NL*
with
hot
iron
,
or
torn
by
bloodhounds
.
On
the
contrary
,
I
had
always
been
*NL*
kindly
treated
,
and
tenderly
cared
for
,
until
I
came
into
the
hands
of
Dr.
*NL*
Flint
.
I
had
never
wished
for
freedom
till
then
.
But
though
my
life
in
*NL*
slavery
was
comparatively
devoid
of
hardships
,
God
pity
the
woman
who
is
*NL*
compelled
to
lead
such
a
life
!
*NL*
*NL*
My
food
was
passed
up
to
me
through
the
trap-door
my
uncle
had
contrived
;
*NL*
and
my
grandmother
,
my
uncle
Phillip
,
and
aunt
Nancy
would
seize
such
*NL*
opportunities
as
they
could
,
to
mount
up
there
and
chat
with
me
at
the
*NL*
opening
.
But
of
course
this
was
not
safe
in
the
daytime
.
It
must
all
be
*NL*
done
in
darkness
.
It
was
impossible
for
me
to
move
in
an
erect
position
,
*NL*
but
I
crawled
about
my
den
for
exercise
.
One
day
I
hit
my
head
against
*NL*
something
,
and
found
it
was
a
gimlet
.
My
uncle
had
left
it
sticking
there
*NL*
when
he
made
the
trap-door
.
I
was
as
rejoiced
as
Robinson
Crusoe
could
have
*NL*
been
at
finding
such
a
treasure
.
It
put
a
lucky
thought
into
my
head
.
I
*NL*
said
to
myself
,
``
Now
I
will
have
some
light
.
Now
I
will
see
my
children
.
''
I
*NL*
did
not
dare
to
begin
my
work
during
the
daytime
,
for
fear
of
attracting
*NL*
attention
.
But
I
groped
round
;
and
having
found
the
side
next
the
street
,
*NL*
where
I
could
frequently
see
my
children
,
I
stuck
the
gimlet
in
and
waited
*NL*
for
evening
.
I
bored
three
rows
of
holes
,
one
above
another
;
then
I
bored
*NL*
out
the
interstices
between
.
I
thus
succeeded
in
making
one
hole
about
an
*NL*
inch
long
and
an
inch
broad
.
I
sat
by
it
till
late
into
the
night
,
to
enjoy
*NL*
the
little
whiff
of
air
that
floated
in
.
In
the
morning
I
watched
for
my
*NL*
children
.
The
first
person
I
saw
in
the
street
was
Dr.
Flint
.
I
had
a
*NL*
shuddering
,
superstitious
feeling
that
it
was
a
bad
omen
.
Several
familiar
*NL*
faces
passed
by
.
At
last
I
heard
the
merry
laugh
of
children
,
and
presently
*NL*
two
sweet
little
faces
were
looking
up
at
me
,
as
though
they
knew
I
was
*NL*
there
,
and
were
conscious
of
the
joy
they
imparted
.
How
I
longed
to
_
tell
_
*NL*
them
I
was
there
!
*NL*
*NL*
My
condition
was
now
a
little
improved
.
But
for
weeks
I
was
tormented
by
*NL*
hundreds
of
little
red
insects
,
fine
as
a
needle
's
point
,
that
pierced
*NL*
through
my
skin
,
and
produced
an
intolerable
burning
.
The
good
grandmother
*NL*
gave
me
herb
teas
and
cooling
medicines
,
and
finally
I
got
rid
of
them
.
The
*NL*
heat
of
my
den
was
intense
,
for
nothing
but
thin
shingles
protected
me
from
*NL*
the
scorching
summer
's
sun
.
But
I
had
my
consolations
.
Through
my
*NL*
peeping-hole
I
could
watch
the
children
,
and
when
they
were
near
enough
,
I
*NL*
could
hear
their
talk
.
Aunt
Nancy
brought
me
all
the
news
she
could
hear
at
*NL*
Dr.
Flint
's
.
From
her
I
learned
that
the
doctor
had
written
to
New
York
to
*NL*
a
colored
woman
,
who
had
been
born
and
raised
in
our
neighborhood
,
and
had
*NL*
breathed
his
contaminating
atmosphere
.
He
offered
her
a
reward
if
she
could
*NL*
find
out
any
thing
about
me
.
I
know
not
what
was
the
nature
of
her
reply
;
*NL*
but
he
soon
after
started
for
New
York
in
haste
,
saying
to
his
family
that
*NL*
he
had
business
of
importance
to
transact
.
I
peeped
at
him
as
he
passed
on
*NL*
his
way
to
the
steamboat
.
It
was
a
satisfaction
to
have
miles
of
land
and
*NL*
water
between
us
,
even
for
a
little
while
;
and
it
was
a
still
greater
*NL*
satisfaction
to
know
that
he
believed
me
to
be
in
the
Free
States
.
My
*NL*
little
den
seemed
less
dreary
than
it
had
done
.
He
returned
,
as
he
did
from
*NL*
his
former
journey
to
New
York
,
without
obtaining
any
satisfactory
*NL*
information
.
When
he
passed
our
house
next
morning
,
Benny
was
standing
at
*NL*
the
gate
.
He
had
heard
them
say
that
he
had
gone
to
find
me
,
and
he
called
*NL*
out
,
``
Dr.
Flint
,
did
you
bring
my
mother
home
?
I
want
to
see
her
.
''
The
*NL*
doctor
stamped
his
foot
at
him
in
a
rage
,
and
exclaimed
,
``
Get
out
of
the
*NL*
way
,
you
little
damned
rascal
!
If
you
do
n't
,
I
'll
cut
off
your
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Benny
ran
terrified
into
the
house
,
saying
,
``
You
ca
n't
put
me
in
jail
*NL*
again
.
I
do
n't
belong
to
you
now
.
''
It
was
well
that
the
wind
carried
the
*NL*
words
away
from
the
doctor
's
ear
.
I
told
my
grandmother
of
it
,
when
we
had
*NL*
our
next
conference
at
the
trap-door
,
and
begged
of
her
not
to
allow
the
*NL*
children
to
be
impertinent
to
the
irascible
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Autumn
came
,
with
a
pleasant
abatement
of
heat
.
My
eyes
had
become
*NL*
accustomed
to
the
dim
light
,
and
by
holding
my
book
or
work
in
a
certain
*NL*
position
near
the
aperture
I
contrived
to
read
and
sew
.
That
was
a
great
*NL*
relief
to
the
tedious
monotony
of
my
life
.
But
when
winter
came
,
the
cold
*NL*
penetrated
through
the
thin
shingle
roof
,
and
I
was
dreadfully
chilled
.
The
*NL*
winters
there
are
not
so
long
,
or
so
severe
,
as
in
northern
latitudes
;
but
*NL*
the
houses
are
not
built
to
shelter
from
cold
,
and
my
little
den
was
*NL*
peculiarly
comfortless
.
The
kind
grandmother
brought
me
bedclothes
and
warm
*NL*
drinks
.
Often
I
was
obliged
to
lie
in
bed
all
day
to
keep
comfortable
;
but
*NL*
with
all
my
precautions
,
my
shoulders
and
feet
were
frostbitten
.
O
,
those
*NL*
long
,
gloomy
days
,
with
no
object
for
my
eye
to
rest
upon
,
and
no
thoughts
*NL*
to
occupy
my
mind
,
except
the
dreary
past
and
the
uncertain
future
!
I
was
*NL*
thankful
when
there
came
a
day
sufficiently
mild
for
me
to
wrap
myself
up
*NL*
and
sit
at
the
loophole
to
watch
the
passers
by
.
Southerners
have
the
habit
*NL*
of
stopping
and
talking
in
the
streets
,
and
I
heard
many
conversations
not
*NL*
intended
to
meet
my
ears
.
I
heard
slave-hunters
planning
how
to
catch
some
*NL*
poor
fugitive
.
Several
times
I
heard
allusions
to
Dr.
Flint
,
myself
,
and
*NL*
the
history
of
my
children
,
who
,
perhaps
,
were
playing
near
the
gate
.
One
*NL*
would
say
,
``
I
would
n't
move
my
little
finger
to
catch
her
,
as
old
Flint
's
*NL*
property
.
''
Another
would
say
,
``
I
'll
catch
_
any
_
nigger
for
the
reward
.
A
*NL*
man
ought
to
have
what
belongs
to
him
,
if
he
_
is
_
a
damned
brute
.
''
The
*NL*
opinion
was
often
expressed
that
I
was
in
the
Free
States
.
Very
rarely
did
*NL*
any
one
suggest
that
I
might
be
in
the
vicinity
.
Had
the
least
suspicion
*NL*
rested
on
my
grandmother
's
house
,
it
would
have
been
burned
to
the
ground
.
*NL*
But
it
was
the
last
place
they
thought
of
.
Yet
there
was
no
place
,
where
*NL*
slavery
existed
,
that
could
have
afforded
me
so
good
a
place
of
*NL*
concealment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Flint
and
his
family
repeatedly
tried
to
coax
and
bribe
my
children
to
*NL*
tell
something
they
had
heard
said
about
me
.
One
day
the
doctor
took
them
*NL*
into
a
shop
,
and
offered
them
some
bright
little
silver
pieces
and
gay
*NL*
handkerchiefs
if
they
would
tell
where
their
mother
was
.
Ellen
shrank
away
*NL*
from
him
,
and
would
not
speak
;
but
Benny
spoke
up
,
and
said
,
``
Dr.
Flint
,
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
where
my
mother
is
.
I
guess
she
's
in
New
York
;
and
when
you
go
*NL*
there
again
,
I
wish
you
'd
ask
her
to
come
home
,
for
I
want
to
see
her
;
but
*NL*
if
you
put
her
in
jail
,
or
tell
her
you
'll
cut
her
head
off
,
I
'll
tell
her
*NL*
to
go
right
back
.

XXII
.
Christmas
Festivities
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Christmas
was
approaching
.
Grandmother
brought
me
materials
,
and
I
busied
*NL*
myself
making
some
new
garments
and
little
playthings
for
my
children
.
Were
*NL*
it
not
that
hiring
day
is
near
at
hand
,
and
many
families
are
fearfully
*NL*
looking
forward
to
the
probability
of
separation
in
a
few
days
,
Christmas
*NL*
might
be
a
happy
season
for
the
poor
slaves
.
Even
slave
mothers
try
to
*NL*
gladden
the
hearts
of
their
little
ones
on
that
occasion
.
Benny
and
Ellen
*NL*
had
their
Christmas
stockings
filled
.
Their
imprisoned
mother
could
not
*NL*
have
the
privilege
of
witnessing
their
surprise
and
joy
.
But
I
had
the
*NL*
pleasure
of
peeping
at
them
as
they
went
into
the
street
with
their
new
*NL*
suits
on
.
I
heard
Benny
ask
a
little
playmate
whether
Santa
Claus
brought
*NL*
him
any
thing
.
``
Yes
,
''
replied
the
boy
;
``
but
Santa
Claus
ai
n't
a
real
man
.
*NL*
It
's
the
children
's
mothers
that
put
things
into
the
stockings
.
''
``
No
,
that
*NL*
ca
n't
be
,
''
replied
Benny
,
``
for
Santa
Claus
brought
Ellen
and
me
these
new
*NL*
clothes
,
and
my
mother
has
been
gone
this
long
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
How
I
longed
to
tell
him
that
his
mother
made
those
garments
,
and
that
many
*NL*
a
tear
fell
on
them
while
she
worked
!
*NL*
*NL*
Every
child
rises
early
on
Christmas
morning
to
see
the
Johnkannaus
.
*NL*
Without
them
,
Christmas
would
be
shorn
of
its
greatest
attraction
.
They
*NL*
consist
of
companies
of
slaves
from
the
plantations
,
generally
of
the
lower
*NL*
class
.
Two
athletic
men
,
in
calico
wrappers
,
have
a
net
thrown
over
them
,
*NL*
covered
with
all
manner
of
bright-colored
stripes
.
Cows
'
tails
are
fastened
*NL*
to
their
backs
,
and
their
heads
are
decorated
with
horns
.
A
box
,
covered
*NL*
with
sheepskin
,
is
called
the
gumbo
box
.
A
dozen
beat
on
this
,
while
other
*NL*
strike
triangles
and
jawbones
,
to
which
bands
of
dancers
keep
time
.
For
a
*NL*
month
previous
they
are
composing
songs
,
which
are
sung
on
this
occasion
.
*NL*
These
companies
,
of
a
hundred
each
,
turn
out
early
in
the
morning
,
and
are
*NL*
allowed
to
go
round
till
twelve
o'clock
,
begging
for
contributions
.
Not
a
*NL*
door
is
left
unvisited
where
there
is
the
least
chance
of
obtaining
a
penny
*NL*
or
a
glass
of
rum
.
They
do
not
drink
while
they
are
out
,
but
carry
the
rum
*NL*
home
in
jugs
,
to
have
a
carousal
.
These
Christmas
donations
frequently
*NL*
amount
to
twenty
or
thirty
dollars
.
It
is
seldom
that
any
white
man
or
*NL*
child
refuses
to
give
them
a
trifle
.
If
he
does
,
they
regale
his
ears
with
*NL*
the
following
song
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
massa
,
so
dey
say
;
*NL*
Down
in
de
heel
,
so
dey
say
;
*NL*
Got
no
money
,
so
dey
say
;
*NL*
Not
one
shillin
,
so
dey
say
;
*NL*
God
A'mighty
bress
you
,
so
dey
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
Christmas
is
a
day
of
feasting
,
both
with
white
and
colored
people
.
Slaves
,
*NL*
who
are
lucky
enough
to
have
a
few
shillings
,
are
sure
to
spend
them
for
*NL*
good
eating
;
and
many
a
turkey
and
pig
is
captured
,
without
saying
,
``
By
*NL*
your
leave
,
sir
.
''
Those
who
can
not
obtain
these
,
cook
a
`
possum
,
or
a
*NL*
raccoon
,
from
which
savory
dishes
can
be
made
.
My
grandmother
raised
*NL*
poultry
and
pigs
for
sale
and
it
was
her
established
custom
to
have
both
a
*NL*
turkey
and
a
pig
roasted
for
Christmas
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
this
occasion
,
I
was
warned
to
keep
extremely
quiet
,
because
two
guests
*NL*
had
been
invited
.
One
was
the
town
constable
,
and
the
other
was
a
free
*NL*
colored
man
,
who
tried
to
pass
himself
off
for
white
,
and
who
was
always
*NL*
ready
to
do
any
mean
work
for
the
sake
of
currying
favor
with
white
people
.
*NL*
My
grandmother
had
a
motive
for
inviting
them
.
She
managed
to
take
them
all
*NL*
over
the
house
.
All
the
rooms
on
the
lower
floor
were
thrown
open
for
them
*NL*
to
pass
in
and
out
;
and
after
dinner
,
they
were
invited
up
stairs
to
look
*NL*
at
a
fine
mocking
bird
my
uncle
had
just
brought
home
.
There
,
too
,
the
*NL*
rooms
were
all
thrown
open
that
they
might
look
in
.
When
I
heard
them
*NL*
talking
on
the
piazza
,
my
heart
almost
stood
still
.
I
knew
this
colored
man
*NL*
had
spent
many
nights
hunting
for
me
.
Every
body
knew
he
had
the
blood
of
a
*NL*
slave
father
in
his
veins
;
but
for
the
sake
of
passing
himself
off
for
*NL*
white
,
he
was
ready
to
kiss
the
slaveholders
'
feet
.
How
I
despised
him
!
As
*NL*
for
the
constable
,
he
wore
no
false
colors
.
The
duties
of
his
office
were
*NL*
despicable
,
but
he
was
superior
to
his
companion
,
inasmuch
as
he
did
not
*NL*
pretend
to
be
what
he
was
not
.
Any
white
man
,
who
could
raise
money
enough
*NL*
to
buy
a
slave
,
would
have
considered
himself
degraded
by
being
a
*NL*
constable
;
but
the
office
enabled
its
possessor
to
exercise
authority
.
If
*NL*
he
found
any
slave
out
after
nine
o'clock
,
he
could
whip
him
as
much
as
he
*NL*
liked
;
and
that
was
a
privilege
to
be
coveted
.
When
the
guests
were
ready
*NL*
to
depart
,
my
grandmother
gave
each
of
them
some
of
her
nice
pudding
,
as
a
*NL*
present
for
their
wives
.
Through
my
peep-hole
I
saw
them
go
out
of
the
*NL*
gate
,
and
I
was
glad
when
it
closed
after
them
.
So
passed
the
first
*NL*
Christmas
in
my
den
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XXIII
.
Still
In
Prison
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
spring
returned
,
and
I
took
in
the
little
patch
of
green
the
aperture
*NL*
commanded
,
I
asked
myself
how
many
more
summers
and
winters
I
must
be
*NL*
condemned
to
spend
thus
.
I
longed
to
draw
in
a
plentiful
draught
of
fresh
*NL*
air
,
to
stretch
my
cramped
limbs
,
to
have
room
to
stand
erect
,
to
feel
the
*NL*
earth
under
my
feet
again
.
My
relatives
were
constantly
on
the
lookout
for
*NL*
a
chance
of
escape
;
but
none
offered
that
seemed
practicable
,
and
even
*NL*
tolerably
safe
.
The
hot
summer
came
again
,
and
made
the
turpentine
drop
*NL*
from
the
thin
roof
over
my
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
long
nights
I
was
restless
for
want
of
air
,
and
I
had
no
room
to
*NL*
toss
and
turn
.
There
was
but
one
compensation
;
the
atmosphere
was
so
*NL*
stifled
that
even
mosquitos
would
not
condescend
to
buzz
in
it
.
With
all
my
*NL*
detestation
of
Dr.
Flint
,
I
could
hardly
wish
him
a
worse
punishment
,
*NL*
either
in
this
world
or
that
which
is
to
come
,
than
to
suffer
what
I
*NL*
suffered
in
one
single
summer
.
Yet
the
laws
allowed
_
him
_
to
be
out
in
the
*NL*
free
air
,
while
I
,
guiltless
of
crime
,
was
pent
up
here
,
as
the
only
means
*NL*
of
avoiding
the
cruelties
the
laws
allowed
him
to
inflict
upon
me
!
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
what
kept
life
within
me
.
Again
and
again
,
I
thought
I
should
die
*NL*
before
long
;
but
I
saw
the
leaves
of
another
autumn
whirl
through
the
air
,
*NL*
and
felt
the
touch
of
another
winter
.
In
summer
the
most
terrible
thunder
*NL*
storms
were
acceptable
,
for
the
rain
came
through
the
roof
,
and
I
rolled
up
*NL*
my
bed
that
it
might
cool
the
hot
boards
under
it
.
Later
in
the
season
,
*NL*
storms
sometimes
wet
my
clothes
through
and
through
,
and
that
was
not
*NL*
comfortable
when
the
air
grew
chilly
.
Moderate
storms
I
could
keep
out
by
*NL*
filling
the
chinks
with
oakum
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
uncomfortable
as
my
situation
was
,
I
had
glimpses
of
things
out
of
*NL*
doors
,
which
made
me
thankful
for
my
wretched
hiding-place
.
One
day
I
saw
a
*NL*
slave
pass
our
gate
,
muttering
,
``
It
's
his
own
,
and
he
can
kill
it
if
he
*NL*
will
.
''
My
grandmother
told
me
that
woman
's
history
.
Her
mistress
had
that
*NL*
day
seen
her
baby
for
the
first
time
,
and
in
the
lineaments
of
its
fair
*NL*
face
she
saw
a
likeness
to
her
husband
.
She
turned
the
bondwoman
and
her
*NL*
child
out
of
doors
,
and
forbade
her
ever
to
return
.
The
slave
went
to
her
*NL*
master
,
and
told
him
what
had
happened
.
He
promised
to
talk
with
her
*NL*
mistress
,
and
make
it
all
right
.
The
next
day
she
and
her
baby
were
sold
to
*NL*
a
Georgia
trader
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
time
I
saw
a
woman
rush
wildly
by
,
pursued
by
two
men
.
She
was
a
*NL*
slave
,
the
wet
nurse
of
her
mistress
's
children
.
For
some
trifling
offence
*NL*
her
mistress
ordered
her
to
be
stripped
and
whipped
.
To
escape
the
*NL*
degradation
and
the
torture
,
she
rushed
to
the
river
,
jumped
in
,
and
ended
*NL*
her
wrongs
in
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
Senator
Brown
,
of
Mississippi
,
could
not
be
ignorant
of
many
such
facts
as
*NL*
these
,
for
they
are
of
frequent
occurrence
in
every
Southern
State
.
Yet
he
*NL*
stood
up
in
the
Congress
of
the
United
States
,
and
declared
that
slavery
*NL*
was
``
a
great
moral
,
social
,
and
political
blessing
;
a
blessing
to
the
*NL*
master
,
and
a
blessing
to
the
slave
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
suffered
much
more
during
the
second
winter
than
I
did
during
the
first
.
*NL*
My
limbs
were
benumbed
by
inaction
,
and
the
cold
filled
them
with
cramp
.
I
*NL*
had
a
very
painful
sensation
of
coldness
in
my
head
;
even
my
face
and
*NL*
tongue
stiffened
,
and
I
lost
the
power
of
speech
.
Of
course
it
was
*NL*
impossible
,
under
the
circumstances
,
to
summon
any
physician
.
My
brother
*NL*
William
came
and
did
all
he
could
for
me
.
Uncle
Phillip
also
watched
*NL*
tenderly
over
me
;
and
poor
grandmother
crept
up
and
down
to
inquire
whether
*NL*
there
were
any
signs
of
returning
life
.
I
was
restored
to
consciousness
by
*NL*
the
dashing
of
cold
water
in
my
face
,
and
found
myself
leaning
against
my
*NL*
brother
's
arm
,
while
he
bent
over
me
with
streaming
eyes
.
He
afterwards
*NL*
told
me
he
thought
I
was
dying
,
for
I
had
been
in
an
unconscious
state
*NL*
sixteen
hours
.
I
next
became
delirious
,
and
was
in
great
danger
of
*NL*
betraying
myself
and
my
friends
.
To
prevent
this
,
they
stupefied
me
with
*NL*
drugs
.
I
remained
in
bed
six
weeks
,
weary
in
body
and
sick
at
heart
.
How
to
*NL*
get
medical
advice
was
the
question
.
William
finally
went
to
a
Thompsonian
*NL*
doctor
,
and
described
himself
as
having
all
my
pains
and
aches
.
He
returned
*NL*
with
herbs
,
roots
,
and
ointment
.
He
was
especially
charged
to
rub
on
the
*NL*
ointment
by
a
fire
;
but
how
could
a
fire
be
made
in
my
little
den
?
Charcoal
*NL*
in
a
furnace
was
tried
,
but
there
was
no
outlet
for
the
gas
,
and
it
nearly
*NL*
cost
me
my
life
.
Afterwards
coals
,
already
kindled
,
were
brought
up
in
an
*NL*
iron
pan
,
and
placed
on
bricks
.
I
was
so
weak
,
and
it
was
so
long
since
I
*NL*
had
enjoyed
the
warmth
of
a
fire
,
that
those
few
coals
actually
made
me
*NL*
weep
.
I
think
the
medicines
did
me
some
good
;
but
my
recovery
was
very
*NL*
slow
.
Dark
thoughts
passed
through
my
mind
as
I
lay
there
day
after
day
.
I
*NL*
tried
to
be
thankful
for
my
little
cell
,
dismal
as
it
was
,
and
even
to
love
*NL*
it
,
as
part
of
the
price
I
had
paid
for
the
redemption
of
my
children
.
*NL*
Sometimes
I
thought
God
was
a
compassionate
Father
,
who
would
forgive
my
*NL*
sins
for
the
sake
of
my
sufferings
.
At
other
times
,
it
seemed
to
me
there
*NL*
was
no
justice
or
mercy
in
the
divine
government
.
I
asked
why
the
curse
of
*NL*
slavery
was
permitted
to
exist
,
and
why
I
had
been
so
persecuted
and
*NL*
wronged
from
youth
upward
.
These
things
took
the
shape
of
mystery
,
which
is
*NL*
to
this
day
not
so
clear
to
my
soul
as
I
trust
it
will
be
hereafter
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
midst
of
my
illness
,
grandmother
broke
down
under
the
weight
and
*NL*
anxiety
and
toil
.
The
idea
of
losing
her
,
who
had
always
been
my
best
*NL*
friend
and
a
mother
to
my
children
,
was
the
sorest
trial
I
had
yet
had
.
O
,
*NL*
how
earnestly
I
prayed
that
she
might
recover
!
How
hard
it
seemed
,
that
I
*NL*
could
not
tend
upon
her
,
who
had
so
long
and
so
tenderly
watched
over
me
!
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
the
screams
of
a
child
nerved
me
with
strength
to
crawl
to
my
*NL*
peeping-hole
,
and
I
saw
my
son
covered
with
blood
.
A
fierce
dog
,
usually
*NL*
kept
chained
,
had
seized
and
bitten
him
.
A
doctor
was
sent
for
,
and
I
heard
*NL*
the
groans
and
screams
of
my
child
while
the
wounds
were
being
sewed
up
.
O
,
*NL*
what
torture
to
a
mother
's
heart
,
to
listen
to
this
and
be
unable
to
go
to
*NL*
him
!
*NL*
*NL*
But
childhood
is
like
a
day
in
spring
,
alternately
shower
and
sunshine
.
*NL*
Before
night
Benny
was
bright
and
lively
,
threatening
the
destruction
of
*NL*
the
dog
;
and
great
was
his
delight
when
the
doctor
told
him
the
next
day
*NL*
that
the
dog
had
bitten
another
boy
and
been
shot
.
Benny
recovered
from
his
*NL*
wounds
;
but
it
was
long
before
he
could
walk
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
my
grandmother
's
illness
became
known
,
many
ladies
,
who
were
her
*NL*
customers
,
called
to
bring
her
some
little
comforts
,
and
to
inquire
whether
*NL*
she
had
every
thing
she
wanted
.
Aunt
Nancy
one
night
asked
permission
to
*NL*
watch
with
her
sick
mother
,
and
Mrs.
Flint
replied
,
``
I
do
n't
see
any
need
*NL*
of
your
going
.
I
ca
n't
spare
you
.
''
But
when
she
found
other
ladies
in
the
*NL*
neighborhood
were
so
attentive
,
not
wishing
to
be
outdone
in
Christian
*NL*
charity
,
she
also
sallied
forth
,
in
magnificent
condescension
,
and
stood
by
*NL*
the
bedside
of
her
who
had
loved
her
in
her
infancy
,
and
who
had
been
*NL*
repaid
by
such
grievous
wrongs
.
She
seemed
surprised
to
find
her
so
ill
,
*NL*
and
scolded
uncle
Phillip
for
not
sending
for
Dr.
Flint
.
She
herself
sent
*NL*
for
him
immediately
,
and
he
came
.
Secure
as
I
was
in
my
retreat
,
I
should
*NL*
have
been
terrified
if
I
had
known
he
was
so
near
me
.
He
pronounced
my
*NL*
grandmother
in
a
very
critical
situation
,
and
said
if
her
attending
*NL*
physician
wished
it
,
he
would
visit
her
.
Nobody
wished
to
have
him
coming
*NL*
to
the
house
at
all
hours
,
and
we
were
not
disposed
to
give
him
a
chance
to
*NL*
make
out
a
long
bill
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Mrs.
Flint
went
out
,
Sally
told
her
the
reason
Benny
was
lame
was
,
that
*NL*
a
dog
had
bitten
him
.
``
I
'm
glad
of
it
,
''
replied
she
.
``
I
wish
he
had
killed
*NL*
him
.
It
would
be
good
news
to
send
to
his
mother
.
_
Her
_
day
will
come
.
The
*NL*
dogs
will
grab
_
her
_
yet
.
''
With
these
Christian
words
she
and
her
husband
*NL*
departed
,
and
,
to
my
great
satisfaction
,
returned
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
learned
from
uncle
Phillip
,
with
feelings
of
unspeakable
joy
and
*NL*
gratitude
,
that
the
crisis
was
passed
and
grandmother
would
live
.
I
could
*NL*
now
say
from
my
heart
,
``
God
is
merciful
.
He
has
spared
me
the
anguish
of
*NL*
feeling
that
I
caused
her
death
.

XXIV
.
The
Candidate
For
Congress
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
summer
had
nearly
ended
,
when
Dr.
Flint
made
a
third
visit
to
New
York
,
*NL*
in
search
of
me
.
Two
candidates
were
running
for
Congress
,
and
he
returned
*NL*
in
season
to
vote
.
The
father
of
my
children
was
the
Whig
candidate
.
The
*NL*
doctor
had
hitherto
been
a
stanch
Whig
;
but
now
he
exerted
all
his
energies
*NL*
for
the
defeat
of
Mr.
Sands
.
He
invited
large
parties
of
men
to
dine
in
the
*NL*
shade
of
his
trees
,
and
supplied
them
with
plenty
of
rum
and
brandy
.
If
any
*NL*
poor
fellow
drowned
his
wits
in
the
bowl
,
and
,
in
the
openness
of
his
*NL*
convivial
heart
,
proclaimed
that
he
did
not
mean
to
vote
the
Democratic
*NL*
ticket
,
he
was
shoved
into
the
street
without
ceremony
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
expended
his
liquor
in
vain
.
Mr.
Sands
was
elected
;
an
event
*NL*
which
occasioned
me
some
anxious
thoughts
.
He
had
not
emancipated
my
*NL*
children
,
and
if
he
should
die
they
would
be
at
the
mercy
of
his
heirs
.
Two
*NL*
little
voices
,
that
frequently
met
my
ear
,
seemed
to
plead
with
me
not
to
*NL*
let
their
father
depart
without
striving
to
make
their
freedom
secure
.
*NL*
Years
had
passed
since
I
had
spoken
to
him
.
I
had
not
even
seen
him
since
*NL*
the
night
I
passed
him
,
unrecognized
,
in
my
disguise
of
a
sailor
.
I
*NL*
supposed
he
would
call
before
he
left
,
to
say
something
to
my
grandmother
*NL*
concerning
the
children
,
and
I
resolved
what
course
to
take
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
before
his
departure
for
Washington
I
made
arrangements
,
toward
*NL*
evening
,
to
get
from
my
hiding-place
into
the
storeroom
below
.
I
found
*NL*
myself
so
stiff
and
clumsy
that
it
was
with
great
difficulty
I
could
hitch
*NL*
from
one
resting
place
to
another
.
When
I
reached
the
storeroom
my
ankles
*NL*
gave
way
under
me
,
and
I
sank
exhausted
on
the
floor
.
It
seemed
as
if
I
*NL*
could
never
use
my
limbs
again
.
But
the
purpose
I
had
in
view
roused
all
*NL*
the
strength
I
had
.
I
crawled
on
my
hands
and
knees
to
the
window
,
and
,
*NL*
screened
behind
a
barrel
,
I
waited
for
his
coming
.
The
clock
struck
nine
,
*NL*
and
I
knew
the
steamboat
would
leave
between
ten
and
eleven
.
My
hopes
were
*NL*
failing
.
But
presently
I
heard
his
voice
,
saying
to
some
one
,
``
Wait
for
me
*NL*
a
moment
.
I
wish
to
see
aunt
Martha
.
''
When
he
came
out
,
as
he
passed
the
*NL*
window
,
I
said
,
``
Stop
one
moment
,
and
let
me
speak
for
my
children
.
''
He
*NL*
started
,
hesitated
,
and
then
passed
on
,
and
went
out
of
the
gate
.
I
closed
*NL*
the
shutter
I
had
partially
opened
,
and
sank
down
behind
the
barrel
.
I
had
*NL*
suffered
much
;
but
seldom
had
I
experienced
a
keener
pang
than
I
then
felt
.
*NL*
Had
my
children
,
then
,
become
of
so
little
consequence
to
him
?
And
had
he
*NL*
so
little
feeling
for
their
wretched
mother
that
he
would
not
listen
a
*NL*
moment
while
she
pleaded
for
them
?
Painful
memories
were
so
busy
within
me
,
*NL*
that
I
forgot
I
had
not
hooked
the
shutter
,
till
I
heard
some
one
opening
*NL*
it
.
I
looked
up
.
He
had
come
back
.
``
Who
called
me
?
''
said
he
,
in
a
low
tone
.
*NL*
``
I
did
,
''
I
replied
.
``
Oh
,
Linda
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
knew
your
voice
;
but
I
was
*NL*
afraid
to
answer
,
lest
my
friend
should
hear
me
.
Why
do
you
come
here
?
Is
*NL*
it
possible
you
risk
yourself
in
this
house
?
They
are
mad
to
allow
it
.
I
*NL*
shall
expect
to
hear
that
you
are
all
ruined
,
''
I
did
not
wish
to
implicate
*NL*
him
,
by
letting
him
know
my
place
of
concealment
;
so
I
merely
said
,
``
I
*NL*
thought
you
would
come
to
bid
grandmother
good
by
,
and
so
I
came
here
to
*NL*
speak
a
few
words
to
you
about
emancipating
my
children
.
Many
changes
may
*NL*
take
place
during
the
six
months
you
are
gone
to
Washington
,
and
it
does
*NL*
not
seem
right
for
you
to
expose
them
to
the
risk
of
such
changes
.
I
want
*NL*
nothing
for
myself
;
all
I
ask
is
,
that
you
will
free
my
children
,
or
*NL*
authorize
some
friend
to
do
it
,
before
you
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
promised
he
would
do
it
,
and
also
expressed
a
readiness
;
to
make
any
*NL*
arrangements
whereby
I
could
be
purchased
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
heard
footsteps
approaching
,
and
closed
the
shutter
hastily
.
I
wanted
to
*NL*
crawl
back
to
my
den
,
without
letting
the
family
know
what
I
had
done
;
for
*NL*
I
knew
they
would
deem
it
very
imprudent
.
But
he
stepped
back
into
the
*NL*
house
,
to
tell
my
grandmother
that
he
had
spoken
with
me
at
the
storeroom
*NL*
window
,
and
to
beg
of
her
not
to
allow
me
to
remain
in
the
house
over
night
.
*NL*
He
said
it
was
the
height
of
madness
for
me
to
be
there
;
that
we
should
*NL*
certainly
all
be
ruined
.
Luckily
,
he
was
in
too
much
of
a
hurry
to
wait
for
*NL*
a
reply
,
or
the
dear
old
woman
would
surely
have
told
him
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
tried
to
go
back
to
my
den
,
but
found
it
more
difficult
to
go
up
than
I
*NL*
had
to
come
down
.
Now
that
my
mission
was
fulfilled
,
the
little
strength
*NL*
that
had
supported
me
through
it
was
gone
,
and
I
sank
helpless
on
the
*NL*
floor
.
My
grandmother
,
alarmed
at
the
risk
I
had
run
,
came
into
the
*NL*
storeroom
in
the
dark
,
and
locked
the
door
behind
her
.
``
Linda
,
''
she
*NL*
whispered
,
``
where
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
here
by
the
window
,
''
I
replied
.
``
I
_
could
n't
_
have
him
go
away
*NL*
without
emancipating
the
children
.
Who
knows
what
may
happen
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
come
,
child
,
''
said
she
,
``
it
wo
n't
do
for
you
to
stay
here
another
*NL*
minute
.
You
've
done
wrong
;
but
I
ca
n't
blame
you
,
poor
thing
!
''
I
told
her
*NL*
I
could
not
return
without
assistance
,
and
she
must
call
my
uncle
.
Uncle
*NL*
Phillip
came
,
and
pity
prevented
him
from
scolding
me
.
He
carried
me
back
*NL*
to
my
dungeon
,
laid
me
tenderly
on
the
bed
,
gave
me
some
medicine
,
and
*NL*
asked
me
if
there
was
any
thing
more
he
could
do
.
Then
he
went
away
,
and
I
*NL*
was
left
with
my
own
thoughts
--
starless
as
the
midnight
darkness
around
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
friends
feared
I
should
become
a
cripple
for
life
;
and
I
was
so
weary
of
*NL*
my
long
imprisonment
that
,
had
it
not
been
for
the
hope
of
serving
my
*NL*
children
,
I
should
have
been
thankful
to
die
;
but
,
for
their
sakes
,
I
was
*NL*
willing
to
bear
on
.

XXV
.
Competition
In
Cunning
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Flint
had
not
given
me
up
.
Every
now
and
then
he
would
say
to
my
*NL*
grandmother
that
I
would
yet
come
back
,
and
voluntarily
surrender
myself
;
*NL*
and
that
when
I
did
,
I
could
be
purchased
by
my
relatives
,
or
any
one
who
*NL*
wished
to
buy
me
.
I
knew
his
cunning
nature
too
well
not
to
perceive
that
*NL*
this
was
a
trap
laid
for
me
;
and
so
all
my
friends
understood
it
.
I
*NL*
resolved
to
match
my
cunning
against
his
cunning
.
In
order
to
make
him
*NL*
believe
that
I
was
in
New
York
,
I
resolved
to
write
him
a
letter
dated
from
*NL*
that
place
.
I
sent
for
my
friend
Peter
,
and
asked
him
if
he
knew
any
*NL*
trustworthy
seafaring
person
,
who
would
carry
such
a
letter
to
New
York
,
*NL*
and
put
it
in
the
post
office
there
.
He
said
he
knew
one
that
he
would
*NL*
trust
with
his
own
life
to
the
ends
of
the
world
.
I
reminded
him
that
it
*NL*
was
a
hazardous
thing
for
him
to
undertake
.
He
said
he
knew
it
,
but
he
was
*NL*
willing
to
do
any
thing
to
help
me
.
I
expressed
a
wish
for
a
New
York
*NL*
paper
,
to
ascertain
the
names
of
some
of
the
streets
.
He
run
his
hand
into
*NL*
his
pocket
,
and
said
,
``
Here
is
half
a
one
,
that
was
round
a
cap
I
bought
of
*NL*
a
pedler
yesterday
.
''
I
told
him
the
letter
would
be
ready
the
next
evening
.
*NL*
He
bade
me
good
by
,
adding
,
``
Keep
up
your
spirits
,
Linda
;
brighter
days
*NL*
will
come
by
and
by
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
uncle
Phillip
kept
watch
over
the
gate
until
our
brief
interview
was
*NL*
over
.
Early
the
next
morning
,
I
seated
myself
near
the
little
aperture
to
*NL*
examine
the
newspaper
.
It
was
a
piece
of
the
New
York
Herald
;
and
,
for
*NL*
once
,
the
paper
that
systematically
abuses
the
colored
people
,
was
made
to
*NL*
render
them
a
service
.
Having
obtained
what
information
I
wanted
concerning
*NL*
streets
and
numbers
,
I
wrote
two
letters
,
one
to
my
grandmother
,
the
other
*NL*
to
Dr.
Flint
.
I
reminded
him
how
he
,
a
gray-headed
man
,
had
treated
a
*NL*
helpless
child
,
who
had
been
placed
in
his
power
,
and
what
years
of
misery
*NL*
he
had
brought
upon
her
.
To
my
grandmother
,
I
expressed
a
wish
to
have
my
*NL*
children
sent
to
me
at
the
north
,
where
I
could
teach
them
to
respect
*NL*
themselves
,
and
set
them
a
virtuous
example
;
which
a
slave
mother
was
not
*NL*
allowed
to
do
at
the
south
.
I
asked
her
to
direct
her
answer
to
a
certain
*NL*
street
in
Boston
,
as
I
did
not
live
in
New
York
,
though
I
went
there
*NL*
sometimes
.
I
dated
these
letters
ahead
,
to
allow
for
the
time
it
would
take
*NL*
to
carry
them
,
and
sent
a
memorandum
of
the
date
to
the
messenger
.
When
my
*NL*
friend
came
for
the
letters
,
I
said
,
``
God
bless
and
reward
you
,
Peter
,
for
*NL*
this
disinterested
kindness
.
Pray
be
careful
.
If
you
are
detected
,
both
you
*NL*
and
I
will
have
to
suffer
dreadfully
.
I
have
not
a
relative
who
would
dare
*NL*
to
do
it
for
me
.
''
He
replied
,
``
You
may
trust
to
me
,
Linda
.
I
do
n't
forget
*NL*
that
your
father
was
my
best
friend
,
and
I
will
be
a
friend
to
his
children
*NL*
so
long
as
God
lets
me
live
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
necessary
to
tell
my
grandmother
what
I
had
done
,
in
order
that
she
*NL*
might
be
ready
for
the
letter
,
and
prepared
to
hear
what
Dr.
Flint
might
*NL*
say
about
my
being
at
the
north
.
She
was
sadly
troubled
.
She
felt
sure
*NL*
mischief
would
come
of
it
.
I
also
told
my
plan
to
aunt
Nancy
,
in
order
that
*NL*
she
might
report
to
us
what
was
said
at
Dr.
Flint
's
house
.
I
whispered
it
*NL*
to
her
through
a
crack
,
and
she
whispered
back
,
``
I
hope
it
will
succeed
.
I
*NL*
sha
n't
mind
being
a
slave
all
_
my
_
life
,
if
I
can
only
see
you
and
the
*NL*
children
free
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
directed
that
my
letters
should
be
put
into
the
New
York
post
office
*NL*
on
the
20th
of
the
month
.
On
the
evening
of
the
24th
my
aunt
came
to
say
*NL*
that
Dr.
Flint
and
his
wife
had
been
talking
in
a
low
voice
about
a
letter
*NL*
he
had
received
,
and
that
when
he
went
to
his
office
he
promised
to
bring
*NL*
it
when
he
came
to
tea
.
So
I
concluded
I
should
hear
my
letter
read
the
*NL*
next
morning
.
I
told
my
grandmother
Dr.
Flint
would
be
sure
to
come
,
and
*NL*
asked
her
to
have
him
sit
near
a
certain
door
,
and
leave
it
open
,
that
I
*NL*
might
hear
what
he
said
.
The
next
morning
I
took
my
station
within
sound
of
*NL*
that
door
,
and
remained
motionless
as
a
statue
.
It
was
not
long
before
I
*NL*
heard
the
gate
slam
,
and
the
well-known
footsteps
enter
the
house
.
He
*NL*
seated
himself
in
the
chair
that
was
placed
for
him
,
and
said
,
``
Well
,
*NL*
Martha
,
I
've
brought
you
a
letter
from
Linda
.
She
has
sent
me
a
letter
,
*NL*
also
.
I
know
exactly
where
to
find
her
;
but
I
do
n't
choose
to
go
to
Boston
*NL*
for
her
.
I
had
rather
she
would
come
back
of
her
own
accord
,
in
a
*NL*
respectable
manner
.
Her
uncle
Phillip
is
the
best
person
to
go
for
her
.
*NL*
With
_
him
_
,
she
would
feel
perfectly
free
to
act
.
I
am
willing
to
pay
his
*NL*
expenses
going
and
returning
.
She
shall
be
sold
to
her
friends
.
Her
*NL*
children
are
free
;
at
least
I
suppose
they
are
;
and
when
you
obtain
her
*NL*
freedom
,
you
'll
make
a
happy
family
.
I
suppose
,
Martha
,
you
have
no
*NL*
objection
to
my
reading
to
you
the
letter
Linda
has
written
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
broke
the
seal
,
and
I
heard
him
read
it
.
The
old
villain
!
He
had
*NL*
suppressed
the
letter
I
wrote
to
grandmother
,
and
prepared
a
substitute
of
*NL*
his
own
,
the
purport
of
which
was
as
follows
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
Dear
Grandmother
:
I
have
long
wanted
to
write
to
you
;
but
the
*NL*
disgraceful
manner
in
which
I
left
you
and
my
children
made
me
*NL*
ashamed
to
do
it
.
If
you
knew
how
much
I
have
suffered
since
I
*NL*
ran
away
,
you
would
pity
and
forgive
me
.
I
have
purchased
freedom
*NL*
at
a
dear
rate
.
If
any
arrangement
could
be
made
for
me
to
return
*NL*
to
the
south
without
being
a
slave
,
I
would
gladly
come
.
If
not
,
*NL*
I
beg
of
you
to
send
my
children
to
the
north
.
I
can
not
live
any
*NL*
longer
without
them
.
Let
me
know
in
time
,
and
I
will
meet
them
in
*NL*
New
York
or
Philadelphia
,
whichever
place
best
suits
my
uncle
's
*NL*
convenience
.
Write
as
soon
as
possible
to
your
unhappy
daughter
,
*NL*
*NL*
Linda
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
very
much
as
I
expected
it
would
be
,
''
said
the
old
hypocrite
,
rising
*NL*
to
go
.
``
You
see
the
foolish
girl
has
repented
of
her
rashness
,
and
wants
to
*NL*
return
.
We
must
help
her
to
do
it
,
Martha
.
Talk
with
Phillip
about
it
.
If
*NL*
he
will
go
for
her
,
she
will
trust
to
him
,
and
come
back
.
I
should
like
an
*NL*
answer
to-morrow
.
Good
morning
,
Martha
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
stepped
out
on
the
piazza
,
he
stumbled
over
my
little
girl
.
``
Ah
,
*NL*
Ellen
,
is
that
you
?
''
he
said
,
in
his
most
gracious
manner
.
``
I
did
n't
see
*NL*
you
.
How
do
you
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pretty
well
,
sir
,
''
she
replied
.
``
I
heard
you
tell
grandmother
that
my
*NL*
mother
is
coming
home
.
I
want
to
see
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Ellen
,
I
am
going
to
bring
her
home
very
soon
,
''
rejoined
he
;
``
and
you
*NL*
shall
see
her
as
much
as
you
like
,
you
little
curly-headed
nigger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
as
good
as
a
comedy
to
me
,
who
had
heard
it
all
;
but
grandmother
*NL*
was
frightened
and
distressed
,
because
the
doctor
wanted
my
uncle
to
go
for
*NL*
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
evening
Dr.
Flint
called
to
talk
the
matter
over
.
My
uncle
told
*NL*
him
that
from
what
he
had
heard
of
Massachusetts
,
he
judged
he
should
be
*NL*
mobbed
if
he
went
there
after
a
runaway
slave
.
``
All
stuff
and
nonsense
,
*NL*
Phillip
!
''
replied
the
doctor
.
``
Do
you
suppose
I
want
you
to
kick
up
a
row
*NL*
in
Boston
?
The
business
can
all
be
done
quietly
.
Linda
writes
that
she
*NL*
wants
to
come
back
.
You
are
her
relative
,
and
she
would
trust
_
you
_
.
The
*NL*
case
would
be
different
if
I
went
.
She
might
object
to
coming
with
_
me
_
;
*NL*
and
the
damned
abolitionists
,
if
they
knew
I
was
her
master
,
would
not
*NL*
believe
me
,
if
I
told
them
she
had
begged
to
go
back
.
They
would
get
up
a
*NL*
row
;
and
I
should
not
like
to
see
Linda
dragged
through
the
streets
like
a
*NL*
common
negro
.
She
has
been
very
ungrateful
to
me
for
all
my
kindness
;
but
I
*NL*
forgive
her
,
and
want
to
act
the
part
of
a
friend
towards
her
.
I
have
no
*NL*
wish
to
hold
her
as
my
slave
.
Her
friends
can
buy
her
as
soon
as
she
*NL*
arrives
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Finding
that
his
arguments
failed
to
convince
my
uncle
,
the
doctor
``
let
the
*NL*
cat
out
of
the
bag
,
''
by
saying
that
he
had
written
to
the
mayor
of
Boston
,
*NL*
to
ascertain
whether
there
was
a
person
of
my
description
at
the
street
and
*NL*
number
from
which
my
letter
was
dated
.
He
had
omitted
this
date
in
the
*NL*
letter
he
had
made
up
to
read
to
my
grandmother
.
If
I
had
dated
from
New
*NL*
York
,
the
old
man
would
probably
have
made
another
journey
to
that
city
.
*NL*
But
even
in
that
dark
region
,
where
knowledge
is
so
carefully
excluded
from
*NL*
the
slave
,
I
had
heard
enough
about
Massachusetts
to
come
to
the
conclusion
*NL*
that
slaveholders
did
not
consider
it
a
comfortable
place
to
go
in
search
*NL*
of
a
runaway
.
That
was
before
the
Fugitive
Slave
Law
was
passed
;
before
*NL*
Massachusetts
had
consented
to
become
a
``
nigger
hunter
''
for
the
south
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
grandmother
,
who
had
become
skittish
by
seeing
her
family
always
in
*NL*
danger
,
came
to
me
with
a
very
distressed
countenance
,
and
said
,
``
What
will
*NL*
you
do
if
the
mayor
of
Boston
sends
him
word
that
you
have
n't
been
there
?
*NL*
Then
he
will
suspect
the
letter
was
a
trick
;
and
maybe
he
'll
find
out
*NL*
something
about
it
,
and
we
shall
all
get
into
trouble
.
O
Linda
,
I
wish
you
*NL*
had
never
sent
the
letters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
worry
yourself
,
Grandmother
,
''
said
I.
``
The
mayor
of
Boston
wo
n't
*NL*
trouble
himself
to
hunt
niggers
for
Dr.
Flint
.
The
letters
will
do
good
in
*NL*
the
end
.
I
shall
get
out
of
this
dark
hole
some
time
or
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
you
will
,
child
,
''
replied
the
good
,
patient
old
friend
.
``
You
have
*NL*
been
here
a
long
time
;
almost
five
years
;
but
whenever
you
do
go
,
it
will
*NL*
break
your
old
grandmother
's
heart
.
I
should
be
expecting
every
day
to
hear
*NL*
that
you
were
brought
back
in
irons
and
put
in
jail
.
God
help
you
,
poor
*NL*
child
!
Let
us
be
thankful
that
some
time
or
other
we
shall
go
`
where
the
*NL*
wicked
cease
from
troubling
,
and
the
weary
are
at
rest
.
'
''
My
heart
*NL*
responded
,
Amen
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fact
that
Dr.
Flint
had
written
to
the
mayor
of
Boston
convinced
me
*NL*
that
he
believed
my
letter
to
be
genuine
,
and
of
course
that
he
had
no
*NL*
suspicion
of
my
being
any
where
in
the
vicinity
.
It
was
a
great
object
to
*NL*
keep
up
this
delusion
,
for
it
made
me
and
my
friends
feel
less
anxious
,
and
*NL*
it
would
be
very
convenient
whenever
there
was
a
chance
to
escape
.
I
*NL*
resolved
,
therefore
,
to
continue
to
write
letters
from
the
north
from
time
*NL*
to
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
or
three
weeks
passed
,
and
as
no
news
came
from
the
mayor
of
Boston
,
*NL*
grandmother
began
to
listen
to
my
entreaty
to
be
allowed
to
leave
my
cell
,
*NL*
sometimes
,
and
exercise
my
limbs
to
prevent
my
becoming
a
cripple
.
I
was
*NL*
allowed
to
slip
down
into
the
small
storeroom
,
early
in
the
morning
,
and
*NL*
remain
there
a
little
while
.
The
room
was
all
filled
up
with
barrels
,
*NL*
except
a
small
open
space
under
my
trap-door
.
This
faced
the
door
,
the
*NL*
upper
part
of
which
was
of
glass
,
and
purposely
left
uncurtained
,
that
the
*NL*
curious
might
look
in
.
The
air
of
this
place
was
close
;
but
it
was
so
much
*NL*
better
than
the
atmosphere
of
my
cell
,
that
I
dreaded
to
return
.
I
came
*NL*
down
as
soon
as
it
was
light
,
and
remained
till
eight
o'clock
,
when
people
*NL*
began
to
be
about
,
and
there
was
danger
that
some
one
might
come
on
the
*NL*
piazza
.
I
had
tried
various
applications
to
bring
warmth
and
feeling
into
*NL*
my
limbs
,
but
without
avail
.
They
were
so
numb
and
stiff
that
it
was
a
*NL*
painful
effort
to
move
;
and
had
my
enemies
come
upon
me
during
the
first
*NL*
mornings
I
tried
to
exercise
them
a
little
in
the
small
unoccupied
space
of
*NL*
the
storeroom
,
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
me
to
have
escaped
.

XXVI
.
Important
Era
In
My
Brother
's
Life
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
missed
the
company
and
kind
attentions
of
my
brother
William
,
who
had
*NL*
gone
to
Washington
with
his
master
,
Mr.
Sands
.
We
received
several
letters
*NL*
from
him
,
written
without
any
allusion
to
me
,
but
expressed
in
such
a
*NL*
manner
that
I
knew
he
did
not
forget
me
.
I
disguised
my
hand
,
and
wrote
to
*NL*
him
in
the
same
manner
.
It
was
a
long
session
;
and
when
it
closed
,
William
*NL*
wrote
to
inform
us
that
Mr.
Sands
was
going
to
the
north
,
to
be
gone
some
*NL*
time
,
and
that
he
was
to
accompany
him
.
I
knew
that
his
master
had
promised
*NL*
to
give
him
his
freedom
,
but
no
time
had
been
specified
.
Would
William
*NL*
trust
to
a
slave
's
chances
?
I
remembered
how
we
used
to
talk
together
,
in
*NL*
our
young
days
,
about
obtaining
our
freedom
,
and
I
thought
it
very
doubtful
*NL*
whether
he
would
come
back
to
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
Grandmother
received
a
letter
from
Mr.
Sands
,
saying
that
William
had
*NL*
proved
a
most
faithful
servant
,
and
he
would
also
say
a
valued
friend
;
that
*NL*
no
mother
had
ever
trained
a
better
boy
.
He
said
he
had
travelled
through
*NL*
the
Northern
States
and
Canada
;
and
though
the
abolitionists
had
tried
to
*NL*
decoy
him
away
,
they
had
never
succeeded
.
He
ended
by
saying
they
should
be
*NL*
at
home
shortly
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
expected
letters
from
William
,
describing
the
novelties
of
his
journey
,
*NL*
but
none
came
.
In
time
,
it
was
reported
that
Mr.
Sands
would
return
late
in
*NL*
the
autumn
,
accompanied
by
a
bride
.
Still
no
letters
from
William
.
I
felt
*NL*
almost
sure
I
should
never
see
him
again
on
southern
soil
;
but
had
he
no
*NL*
word
of
comfort
to
send
to
his
friends
at
home
?
to
the
poor
captive
in
her
*NL*
dungeon
?
My
thoughts
wandered
through
the
dark
past
,
and
over
the
uncertain
*NL*
future
.
Alone
in
my
cell
,
where
no
eye
but
God
's
could
see
me
,
I
wept
*NL*
bitter
tears
.
How
earnestly
I
prayed
to
him
to
restore
me
to
my
children
,
*NL*
and
enable
me
to
be
a
useful
woman
and
a
good
mother
!
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
the
day
arrived
for
the
return
of
the
travellers
.
Grandmother
had
*NL*
made
loving
preparations
to
welcome
her
absent
boy
back
to
the
old
*NL*
hearthstone
.
When
the
dinner
table
was
laid
,
William
's
place
occupied
its
*NL*
old
place
.
The
stage
coach
went
by
empty
.
My
grandmother
waited
dinner
.
She
*NL*
thought
perhaps
he
was
necessarily
detained
by
his
master
.
In
my
prison
I
*NL*
listened
anxiously
,
expecting
every
moment
to
hear
my
dear
brother
's
voice
*NL*
and
step
.
In
the
course
of
the
afternoon
a
lad
was
sent
by
Mr.
Sands
to
*NL*
tell
grandmother
that
William
did
not
return
with
him
;
that
the
*NL*
abolitionists
had
decoyed
him
away
.
But
he
begged
her
not
to
feel
troubled
*NL*
about
it
,
for
he
felt
confident
she
would
see
William
in
a
few
days
.
As
*NL*
soon
as
he
had
time
to
reflect
he
would
come
back
,
for
he
could
never
*NL*
expect
to
be
so
well
off
at
the
north
as
he
had
been
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
you
had
seen
the
tears
,
and
heard
the
sobs
,
you
would
have
thought
the
*NL*
messenger
had
brought
tidings
of
death
instead
of
freedom
.
Poor
old
*NL*
grandmother
felt
that
she
should
never
see
her
darling
boy
again
.
And
I
was
*NL*
selfish
.
I
thought
more
of
what
I
had
lost
,
than
of
what
my
brother
had
*NL*
gained
.
A
new
anxiety
began
to
trouble
me
.
Mr.
Sands
had
expended
a
good
*NL*
deal
of
money
,
and
would
naturally
feel
irritated
by
the
loss
he
had
*NL*
incurred
.
I
greatly
feared
this
might
injure
the
prospects
of
my
children
,
*NL*
who
were
now
becoming
valuable
property
.
I
longed
to
have
their
*NL*
emancipation
made
certain
.
The
more
so
,
because
their
master
and
father
was
*NL*
now
married
.
I
was
too
familiar
with
slavery
not
to
know
that
promises
made
*NL*
to
slaves
,
though
with
kind
intentions
,
and
sincere
at
the
time
,
depend
*NL*
upon
many
contingencies
for
their
fulfillment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Much
as
I
wished
William
to
be
free
,
the
step
he
had
taken
made
me
sad
and
*NL*
anxious
.
The
following
Sabbath
was
calm
and
clear
;
so
beautiful
that
it
*NL*
seemed
like
a
Sabbath
in
the
eternal
world
.
My
grandmother
brought
the
*NL*
children
out
on
the
piazza
,
that
I
might
hear
their
voices
.
She
thought
it
*NL*
would
comfort
me
in
my
despondency
;
and
it
did
.
They
chatted
merrily
,
as
*NL*
only
children
can
.
Benny
said
,
``
Grandmother
,
do
you
think
uncle
Will
has
*NL*
gone
for
good
?
Wo
n't
he
ever
come
back
again
?
May
be
he
'll
find
mother
.
If
*NL*
he
does
,
_
wo
n't
_
she
be
glad
to
see
him
!
Why
do
n't
you
and
uncle
Phillip
,
*NL*
and
all
of
us
,
go
and
live
where
mother
is
?
I
should
like
it
;
would
n't
you
,
*NL*
Ellen
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
should
like
it
,
''
replied
Ellen
;
``
but
how
could
we
find
her
?
Do
you
*NL*
know
the
place
,
grandmother
?
I
do
n't
remember
how
mother
looked
--
do
you
,
*NL*
Benny
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Benny
was
just
beginning
to
describe
me
when
they
were
interrupted
by
an
*NL*
old
slave
woman
,
a
near
neighbor
,
named
Aggie
.
This
poor
creature
had
*NL*
witnessed
the
sale
of
her
children
,
and
seen
them
carried
off
to
parts
*NL*
unknown
,
without
any
hopes
of
ever
hearing
from
them
again
.
She
saw
that
my
*NL*
grandmother
had
been
weeping
,
and
she
said
,
in
a
sympathizing
tone
,
``
What
's
*NL*
the
matter
,
aunt
Marthy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
Aggie
,
''
she
replied
,
``
it
seems
as
if
I
should
n't
have
any
of
my
children
*NL*
or
grandchildren
left
to
hand
me
a
drink
when
I
'm
dying
,
and
lay
my
old
*NL*
body
in
the
ground
.
My
boy
did
n't
come
back
with
Mr.
Sands
.
He
staid
at
the
*NL*
north
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
old
Aggie
clapped
her
hands
for
joy
.
``
Is
_
dat
_
what
you
's
crying
fur
?
''
*NL*
she
exclaimed
.
``
Git
down
on
your
knees
and
bress
de
Lord
!
I
do
n't
know
whar
*NL*
my
poor
chillern
is
,
and
I
nebber
`
spect
to
know
.
You
do
n't

*NL*
Linda
's
gone
to

but

do

know
whar
her
brudder
is

He
's
in
free
parts
;
*NL*
and
dat
's

right
place
.
Do
n't
murmur
at
de
Lord
's
doings
but
git
down
on
*NL*
your
knees
and
tank
him
for
his
goodness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
selfishness
was
rebuked
by
what
poor
Aggie
said
.
She
rejoiced
over
the
*NL*
escape
of
one
who
was
merely
her
fellow-bondman
,
while
his
own
sister
was
*NL*
only
thinking
what
his
good
fortune
might
cost
her
children
.
I
knelt
and
*NL*
prayed
God
to
forgive
me
;
and
I
thanked
him
from
my
heart
,
that
one
of
my
*NL*
family
was
saved
from
the
grasp
of
slavery
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
long
before
we
received
a
letter
from
William
.
He
wrote
that
Mr.
*NL*
Sands
had
always
treated
him
kindly
,
and
that
he
had
tried
to
do
his
duty
*NL*
to
him
faithfully
.
But
ever
since
he
was
a
boy
,
he
had
longed
to
be
free
;
*NL*
and
he
had
already
gone
through
enough
to
convince
him
he
had
better
not
*NL*
lose
the
chance
that
offered
.
He
concluded
by
saying
,
``
Do
n't
worry
about
*NL*
me
,
dear
grandmother
.
I
shall
think
of
you
always
;
and
it
will
spur
me
on
*NL*
to
work
hard
and
try
to
do
right
.
When
I
have
earned
money
enough
to
give
*NL*
you
a
home
,
perhaps
you
will
come
to
the
north
,
and
we
can
all
live
happy
*NL*
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Sands
told
my
uncle
Phillip
the
particulars
about
William
's
leaving
*NL*
him
.
He
said
,
``
I
trusted
him
as
if
he
were
my
own
brother
,
and
treated
him
*NL*
as
kindly
.
The
abolitionists
talked
to
him
in
several
places
;
but
I
had
no
*NL*
idea
they
could
tempt
him
.
However
,
I
do
n't
blame
William
.
He
's
young
and
*NL*
inconsiderate
,
and
those
Northern
rascals
decoyed
him
.
I
must
confess
the
*NL*
scamp
was
very
bold
about
it
.
I
met
him
coming
down
the
steps
of
the
Astor
*NL*
House
with
his
trunk
on
his
shoulder
,
and
I
asked
him
where
he
was
going
.
*NL*
He
said
he
was
going
to
change
his
old
trunk
.
I
told
him
it
was
rather
*NL*
shabby
,
and
asked
if
he
did
n't
need
some
money
.
He
said
,
No
,
thanked
me
,
*NL*
and
went
off
.
He
did
not
return
so
soon
as
I
expected
;
but
I
waited
*NL*
patiently
.
At
last
I
went
to
see
if
our
trunks
were
packed
,
ready
for
our
*NL*
journey
.
I
found
them
locked
,
and
a
sealed
note
on
the
table
informed
me
*NL*
where
I
could
find
the
keys
.
The
fellow
even
tried
to
be
religious
.
He
*NL*
wrote
that
he
hoped
God
would
always
bless
me
,
and
reward
me
for
my
*NL*
kindness
;
that
he
was
not
unwilling
to
serve
me
;
but
he
wanted
to
be
a
free
*NL*
man
;
and
that
if
I
thought
he
did
wrong
,
he
hoped
I
would
forgive
him
.
I
*NL*
intended
to
give
him
his
freedom
in
five
years
.
He
might
have
trusted
me
.
*NL*
He
has
shown
himself
ungrateful
;
but
I
shall
not
go
for
him
,
or
send
for
*NL*
him
.
I
feel
confident
that
he
will
soon
return
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
afterwards
heard
an
account
of
the
affair
from
William
himself
.
He
had
*NL*
not
been
urged
away
by
abolitionists
.
He
needed
no
information
they
could
*NL*
give
him
about
slavery
to
stimulate
his
desire
for
freedom
.
He
looked
at
*NL*
his
hands
,
and
remembered
that
they
were
once
in
irons
.
What
security
had
*NL*
he
that
they
would
not
be
so
again
?
Mr.
Sands
was
kind
to
him
;
but
he
might
*NL*
indefinitely
postpone
the
promise
he
had
made
to
give
him
his
freedom
.
He
*NL*
might
come
under
pecuniary
embarrassments
,
and
his
property
be
seized
by
*NL*
creditors
;
or
he
might
die
,
without
making
any
arrangements
in
his
favor
.
*NL*
He
had
too
often
known
such
accidents
to
happen
to
slaves
who
had
kind
*NL*
masters
,
and
he
wisely
resolved
to
make
sure
of
the
present
opportunity
to
*NL*
own
himself
.
He
was
scrupulous
about
taking
any
money
from
his
master
on
*NL*
false
pretences
;
so
he
sold
his
best
clothes
to
pay
for
his
passage
to
*NL*
Boston
.
The
slaveholders
pronounced
him
a
base
,
ungrateful
wretch
,
for
thus
*NL*
requiting
his
master
's
indulgence
.
What
would
_
they
_
have
done
under
*NL*
similar
circumstances
?
*NL*
*NL*
When
Dr.
Flint
's
family
heard
that
William
had
deserted
Mr.
Sands
,
they
*NL*
chuckled
greatly
over
the
news
.
Mrs.
Flint
made
her
usual
manifestations
of
*NL*
Christian
feeling
,
by
saying
,
``
I
'm
glad
of
it
.
I
hope
he
'll
never
get
him
*NL*
again
.
I
like
to
see
people
paid
back
in
their
own
coin
.
I
reckon
Linda
's
*NL*
children
will
have
to
pay
for
it
.
I
should
be
glad
to
see
them
in
the
*NL*
speculator
's
hands
again
,
for
I
'm
tired
of
seeing
those
little
niggers
*NL*
march
about
the
streets
.

XXVII
.
New
Destination
For
The
Children
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Flint
proclaimed
her
intention
of
informing
Mrs.
Sands
who
was
the
*NL*
father
of
my
children
.
She
likewise
proposed
to
tell
her
what
an
artful
*NL*
devil
I
was
;
that
I
had
made
a
great
deal
of
trouble
in
her
family
;
that
*NL*
when
Mr.
Sands
was
at
the
north
,
she
did
n't
doubt
I
had
followed
him
in
*NL*
disguise
,
and
persuaded
William
to
run
away
.
She
had
some
reason
to
*NL*
entertain
such
an
idea
;
for
I
had
written
from
the
north
,
from
time
to
*NL*
time
,
and
I
dated
my
letters
from
various
places
.
Many
of
them
fell
into
*NL*
Dr.
Flint
's
hands
,
as
I
expected
they
would
;
and
he
must
have
come
to
the
*NL*
conclusion
that
I
travelled
about
a
good
deal
.
He
kept
a
close
watch
over
*NL*
my
children
,
thinking
they
would
eventually
lead
to
my
detection
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
new
and
unexpected
trial
was
in
store
for
me
.
One
day
,
when
Mr.
Sands
and
*NL*
his
wife
were
walking
in
the
street
,
they
met
Benny
.
The
lady
took
a
fancy
*NL*
to
him
,
and
exclaimed
,
``
What
a
pretty
little
negro
!
Whom
does
he
belong
*NL*
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Benny
did
not
hear
the
answer
;
but
he
came
home
very
indignant
with
the
*NL*
stranger
lady
,
because
she
had
called
him
a
negro
.
A
few
days
afterwards
,
*NL*
Mr.
Sands
called
on
my
grandmother
,
and
told
her
he
wanted
her
to
take
the
*NL*
children
to
his
house
.
He
said
he
had
informed
his
wife
of
his
relation
to
*NL*
them
,
and
told
her
they
were
motherless
;
and
she
wanted
to
see
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
gone
,
my
grandmother
came
and
asked
what
I
would
do
.
The
*NL*
question
seemed
a
mockery
.
What
_
could
_
I
do
?
They
were
Mr.
Sands
's
slaves
,
*NL*
and
their
mother
was
a
slave
,
whom
he
had
represented
to
be
dead
.
Perhaps
*NL*
he
thought
I
was
.
I
was
too
much
pained
and
puzzled
to
come
to
any
*NL*
decision
;
and
the
children
were
carried
without
my
knowledge
.
Mrs.
Sands
*NL*
had
a
sister
from
Illinois
staying
with
her
.
This
lady
,
who
had
no
children
*NL*
of
her
own
,
was
so
much
pleased
with
Ellen
,
that
she
offered
to
adopt
her
,
*NL*
and
bring
her
up
as
she
would
a
daughter
.
Mrs.
Sands
wanted
to
take
*NL*
Benjamin
.
When
grandmother
reported
this
to
me
,
I
was
tried
almost
beyond
*NL*
endurance
.
Was
this
all
I
was
to
gain
by
what
I
had
suffered
for
the
sake
*NL*
of
having
my
children
free
?
True
,
the
prospect
_
seemed
_
fair
;
but
I
knew
*NL*
too
well
how
lightly
slaveholders
held
such
``
parental
relations
.
''
If
*NL*
pecuniary
troubles
should
come
,
or
if
the
new
wife
required
more
money
than
*NL*
could
conveniently
be
spared
,
my
children
might
be
thought
of
as
a
*NL*
convenient
means
of
raising
funds
.
I
had
no
trust
in
thee
,
O
Slavery
!
Never
*NL*
should
I
know
peace
till
my
children
were
emancipated
with
all
due
*NL*
formalities
of
law
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
too
proud
to
ask
Mr.
Sands
to
do
any
thing
for
my
own
benefit
;
but
I
*NL*
could
bring
myself
to
become
a
supplicant
for
my
children
.
I
resolved
to
*NL*
remind
him
of
the
promise
he
had
made
me
,
and
to
throw
myself
upon
his
*NL*
honor
for
the
performance
of
it
.
I
persuaded
my
grandmother
to
go
to
him
,
*NL*
and
tell
him
I
was
not
dead
,
and
that
I
earnestly
entreated
him
to
keep
the
*NL*
promise
he
had
made
me
;
that
I
had
heard
of
the
recent
proposals
concerning
*NL*
my
children
,
and
did
not
feel
easy
to
accept
them
;
that
he
had
promised
to
*NL*
emancipate
them
,
and
it
was
time
for
him
to
redeem
his
pledge
.
I
knew
there
*NL*
was
some
risk
in
thus
betraying
that
I
was
in
the
vicinity
;
but
what
will
*NL*
not
a
mother
do
for
her
children
?
He
received
the
message
with
surprise
,
*NL*
and
said
,
``
The
children
are
free
.
I
have
never
intended
to
claim
them
as
*NL*
slaves
.
Linda
may
decide
their
fate
.
In
my
opinion
,
they
had
better
be
sent
*NL*
to
the
north
.
I
do
n't
think
they
are
quite
safe
here
.
Dr.
Flint
boasts
that
*NL*
they
are
still
in
his
power
.
He
says
they
were
his
daughter
's
property
,
and
*NL*
as
she
was
not
of
age
when
they
were
sold
,
the
contract
is
not
legally
*NL*
binding
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
,
then
,
after
all
I
had
endured
for
their
sakes
,
my
poor
children
were
*NL*
between
two
fires
;
between
my
old
master
and
their
new
master
!
And
I
was
*NL*
powerless
.
There
was
no
protecting
arm
of
the
law
for
me
to
invoke
.
Mr.
*NL*
Sands
proposed
that
Ellen
should
go
,
for
the
present
,
to
some
of
his
*NL*
relatives
,
who
had
removed
to
Brooklyn
,
Long
Island
.
It
was
promised
that
*NL*
she
should
be
well
taken
care
of
,
and
sent
to
school
.
I
consented
to
it
,
as
*NL*
the
best
arrangement
I
could
make
for
her
.
My
grandmother
,
of
course
,
*NL*
negotiated
it
all
;
and
Mrs.
Sands
knew
of
no
other
person
in
the
*NL*
transaction
.
She
proposed
that
they
should
take
Ellen
with
them
to
*NL*
Washington
,
and
keep
her
till
they
had
a
good
chance
of
sending
her
,
with
*NL*
friends
,
to
Brooklyn
.
She
had
an
infant
daughter
.
I
had
had
a
glimpse
of
*NL*
it
,
as
the
nurse
passed
with
it
in
her
arms
.
It
was
not
a
pleasant
thought
*NL*
to
me
,
that
the
bondwoman
's
child
should
tend
her
free-born
sister
;
but
*NL*
there
was
no
alternative
.
Ellen
was
made
ready
for
the
journey
.
O
,
how
it
*NL*
tried
my
heart
to
send
her
away
,
so
young
,
alone
,
among
strangers
!
Without
*NL*
a
mother
's
love
to
shelter
her
from
the
storms
of
life
;
almost
without
*NL*
memory
of
a
mother
!
I
doubted
whether
she
and
Benny
would
have
for
me
the
*NL*
natural
affection
that
children
feel
for
a
parent
.
I
thought
to
myself
that
*NL*
I
might
perhaps
never
see
my
daughter
again
,
and
I
had
a
great
desire
that
*NL*
she
should
look
upon
me
,
before
she
went
,
that
she
might
take
my
image
with
*NL*
her
in
her
memory
.
It
seemed
to
me
cruel
to
have
her
brought
to
my
dungeon
.
*NL*
It
was
sorrow
enough
for
her
young
heart
to
know
that
her
mother
was
a
*NL*
victim
of
slavery
,
without
seeing
the
wretched
hiding-place
to
which
it
had
*NL*
driven
her
.
I
begged
permission
to
pass
the
last
night
in
one
of
the
open
*NL*
chambers
,
with
my
little
girl
.
They
thought
I
was
crazy
to
think
of
*NL*
trusting
such
a
young
child
with
my
perilous
secret
.
I
told
them
I
had
*NL*
watched
her
character
,
and
I
felt
sure
she
would
not
betray
me
;
that
I
was
*NL*
determined
to
have
an
interview
,
and
if
they
would
not
facilitate
it
,
I
*NL*
would
take
my
own
way
to
obtain
it
.
They
remonstrated
against
the
rashness
*NL*
of
such
a
proceeding
;
but
finding
they
could
not
change
my
purpose
,
they
*NL*
yielded
.
I
slipped
through
the
trap-door
into
the
storeroom
,
and
my
uncle
*NL*
kept
watch
at
the
gate
,
while
I
passed
into
the
piazza
and
went
up
stairs
,
*NL*
to
the
room
I
used
to
occupy
.
It
was
more
than
five
years
since
I
had
seen
*NL*
it
;
and
how
the
memories
crowded
on
me
!
There
I
had
taken
shelter
when
my
*NL*
mistress
drove
me
from
her
house
;
there
came
my
old
tyrant
,
to
mock
,
*NL*
insult
,
and
curse
me
;
there
my
children
were
first
laid
in
my
arms
;
there
I
*NL*
had
watched
over
them
,
each
day
with
a
deeper
and
sadder
love
;
there
I
had
*NL*
knelt
to
God
,
in
anguish
of
heart
,
to
forgive
the
wrong
I
had
done
.
How
*NL*
vividly
it
all
came
back
!
And
after
this
long
,
gloomy
interval
,
I
stood
*NL*
there
such
a
wreck
!
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
midst
of
these
meditations
,
I
heard
footsteps
on
the
stairs
.
The
*NL*
door
opened
,
and
my
uncle
Phillip
came
in
,
leading
Ellen
by
the
hand
.
I
put
*NL*
my
arms
round
her
,
and
said
,
``
Ellen
,
my
dear
child
,
I
am
your
mother
.
''
She
*NL*
drew
back
a
little
,
and
looked
at
me
;
then
,
with
sweet
confidence
,
she
laid
*NL*
her
cheek
against
mine
,
and
I
folded
her
to
the
heart
that
had
been
so
long
*NL*
desolated
.
She
was
the
first
to
speak
.
Raising
her
head
,
she
said
,
*NL*
inquiringly
,
``
You
really
_
are
_
my
mother
?
''
I
told
her
I
really
was
;
that
*NL*
during
all
the
long
time
she
had
not
seen
me
,
I
had
loved
her
most
*NL*
tenderly
;
and
that
now
she
was
going
away
,
I
wanted
to
see
her
and
talk
*NL*
with
her
,
that
she
might
remember
me
.
With
a
sob
in
her
voice
,
she
said
,
*NL*
``
I
'm
glad
you
've
come
to
see
me
;
but
why
did
n't
you
ever
come
before
?
Benny
*NL*
and
I
have
wanted
so
much
to
see
you
!
He
remembers
you
,
and
sometimes
he
*NL*
tells
me
about
you
.
Why
did
n't
you
come
home
when
Dr.
Flint
went
to
bring
*NL*
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
answered
,
``
I
could
n't
come
before
,
dear
.
But
now
that
I
am
with
you
,
tell
*NL*
me
whether
you
like
to
go
away
.
''
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
she
,
crying
.
*NL*
``
Grandmother
says
I
ought
not
to
cry
;
that
I
am
going
to
a
good
place
,
*NL*
where
I
can
learn
to
read
and
write
,
and
that
by
and
by
I
can
write
her
a
*NL*
letter
.
But
I
sha
n't
have
Benny
,
or
grandmother
,
or
uncle
Phillip
,
or
any
*NL*
body
to
love
me
.
Ca
n't
you
go
with
me
?
O
,
_
do
_
go
,
dear
mother
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
her
I
could
n't
go
now
;
but
sometime
I
would
come
to
her
,
and
then
*NL*
she
and
Benny
and
I
would
live
together
,
and
have
happy
times
.
She
wanted
*NL*
to
run
and
bring
Benny
to
see
me
now
.
I
told
her
he
was
going
to
the
north
,
*NL*
before
long
,
with
uncle
Phillip
,
and
then
I
would
come
to
see
him
before
he
*NL*
went
away
.
I
asked
if
she
would
like
to
have
me
stay
all
night
and
sleep
*NL*
with
her
.
``
O
,
yes
,
''
she
replied
.
Then
,
turning
to
her
uncle
,
she
said
,
*NL*
pleadingly
,
''
_
May
_
I
stay
?
Please
,
uncle
!
She
is
my
own
mother
.
''
He
laid
*NL*
his
hand
on
her
head
,
and
said
,
solemnly
,
``
Ellen
,
this
is
the
secret
you
*NL*
have
promised
grandmother
never
to
tell
.
If
you
ever
speak
of
it
to
any
*NL*
body
,
they
will
never
let
you
see
your
grandmother
again
,
and
your
mother
*NL*
can
never
come
to
Brooklyn
.
''
``
Uncle
,
''
she
replied
,
``
I
will
never
tell
.
''
He
*NL*
told
her
she
might
stay
with
me
;
and
when
he
had
gone
,
I
took
her
in
my
*NL*
arms
and
told
her
I
was
a
slave
,
and
that
was
the
reason
she
must
never
say
*NL*
she
had
seen
me
.
I
exhorted
her
to
be
a
good
child
,
to
try
to
please
the
*NL*
people
where
she
was
going
,
and
that
God
would
raise
her
up
friends
.
I
told
*NL*
her
to
say
her
prayers
,
and
remember
always
to
pray
for
her
poor
mother
,
*NL*
and
that
God
would
permit
us
to
meet
again
.
She
wept
,
and
I
did
not
check
*NL*
her
tears
.
Perhaps
she
would
never
again
have
a
chance
to
pour
her
tears
*NL*
into
a
mother
's
bosom
.
All
night
she
nestled
in
my
arms
,
and
I
had
no
*NL*
inclination
to
slumber
.
The
moments
were
too
precious
to
lose
any
of
them
.
*NL*
Once
,
when
I
thought
she
was
asleep
,
I
kissed
her
forehead
softly
,
and
she
*NL*
said
,
``
I
am
not
asleep
,
dear
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Before
dawn
they
came
to
take
me
back
to
my
den
.
I
drew
aside
the
window
*NL*
curtain
,
to
take
a
last
look
of
my
child
.
The
moonlight
shone
on
her
face
,
*NL*
and
I
bent
over
her
,
as
I
had
done
years
before
,
that
wretched
night
when
I
*NL*
ran
away
.
I
hugged
her
close
to
my
throbbing
heart
;
and
tears
,
too
sad
for
*NL*
such
young
eyes
to
shed
,
flowed
down
her
cheeks
,
as
she
gave
her
last
kiss
,
*NL*
and
whispered
in
my
ear
,
``
Mother
,
I
will
never
tell
.
''
And
she
never
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
got
back
to
my
den
,
I
threw
myself
on
the
bed
and
wept
there
alone
*NL*
in
the
darkness
.
It
seemed
as
if
my
heart
would
burst
.
When
the
time
for
*NL*
Ellen
's
departure
drew
nigh
,
I
could
hear
neighbors
and
friends
saying
to
*NL*
her
,
``
Good
by
,
Ellen
.
I
hope
your
poor
mother
will
find
you
out
.
_
Wo
n't
_
*NL*
you
be
glad
to
see
her
!
''
She
replied
,
``
Yes
,
ma'am
;
''
and
they
little
dreamed
*NL*
of
the
weighty
secret
that
weighed
down
her
young
heart
.
She
was
an
*NL*
affectionate
child
,
but
naturally
very
reserved
,
except
with
those
she
*NL*
loved
,
and
I
felt
secure
that
my
secret
would
be
safe
with
her
.
I
heard
the
*NL*
gate
close
after
her
,
with
such
feelings
as
only
a
slave
mother
can
*NL*
experience
.
During
the
day
my
meditations
were
very
sad
.
Sometimes
I
feared
*NL*
I
had
been
very
selfish
not
to
give
up
all
claim
to
her
,
and
let
her
go
to
*NL*
Illinois
,
to
be
adopted
by
Mrs.
Sands
's
sister
.
It
was
my
experience
of
*NL*
slavery
that
decided
me
against
it
.
I
feared
that
circumstances
might
arise
*NL*
that
would
cause
her
to
be
sent
back
.
I
felt
confident
that
I
should
go
to
*NL*
New
York
myself
;
and
then
I
should
be
able
to
watch
over
her
,
and
in
some
*NL*
degree
protect
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Flint
's
family
knew
nothing
of
the
proposed
arrangement
till
after
*NL*
Ellen
was
gone
,
and
the
news
displeased
them
greatly
.
Mrs.
Flint
called
on
*NL*
Mrs.
Sands
's
sister
to
inquire
into
the
matter
.
She
expressed
her
opinion
*NL*
very
freely
as
to
the
respect
Mr.
Sands
showed
for
his
wife
,
and
for
his
*NL*
own
character
,
in
acknowledging
those
``
young
niggers
.
''
And
as
for
sending
*NL*
Ellen
away
,
she
pronounced
it
to
be
just
as
much
stealing
as
it
would
be
*NL*
for
him
to
come
and
take
a
piece
of
furniture
out
of
her
parlor
.
She
said
*NL*
her
daughter
was
not
of
age
to
sign
the
bill
of
sale
,
and
the
children
were
*NL*
her
property
;
and
when
she
became
of
age
,
or
was
married
,
she
could
take
*NL*
them
,
wherever
she
could
lay
hands
on
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Emily
Flint
,
the
little
girl
to
whom
I
had
been
bequeathed
,
was
now
in
*NL*
her
sixteenth
year
.
Her
mother
considered
it
all
right
and
honorable
for
*NL*
her
,
or
her
future
husband
,
to
steal
my
children
;
but
she
did
not
*NL*
understand
how
any
body
could
hold
up
their
heads
in
respectable
society
,
*NL*
after
they
had
purchased
their
own
children
,
as
Mr.
Sands
had
done
.
Dr.
*NL*
Flint
said
very
little
.
Perhaps
he
thought
that
Benny
would
be
less
likely
*NL*
to
be
sent
away
if
he
kept
quiet
.
One
of
my
letters
,
that
fell
into
his
*NL*
hands
,
was
dated
from
Canada
;
and
he
seldom
spoke
of
me
now
.
This
state
of
*NL*
things
enabled
me
to
slip
down
into
the
storeroom
more
frequently
,
where
I
*NL*
could
stand
upright
,
and
move
my
limbs
more
freely
.
*NL*
*NL*
Days
,
weeks
,
and
months
passed
,
and
there
came
no
news
of
Ellen
.
I
sent
a
*NL*
letter
to
Brooklyn
,
written
in
my
grandmother
's
name
,
to
inquire
whether
*NL*
she
had
arrived
there
.
Answer
was
returned
that
she
had
not
.
I
wrote
to
her
*NL*
in
Washington
;
but
no
notice
was
taken
of
it
.
There
was
one
person
there
,
*NL*
who
ought
to
have
had
some
sympathy
with
the
anxiety
of
the
child
's
friends
*NL*
at
home
;
but
the
links
of
such
relations
as
he
had
formed
with
me
,
are
*NL*
easily
broken
and
cast
away
as
rubbish
.
Yet
how
protectingly
and
*NL*
persuasively
he
once
talked
to
the
poor
,
helpless
slave
girl
!
And
how
*NL*
entirely
I
trusted
him
!
But
now
suspicions
darkened
my
mind
.
Was
my
child
*NL*
dead
,
or
had
they
deceived
me
,
and
sold
her
?
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
secret
memoirs
of
many
members
of
Congress
should
be
published
,
*NL*
curious
details
would
be
unfolded
.
I
once
saw
a
letter
from
a
member
of
*NL*
Congress
to
a
slave
,
who
was
the
mother
of
six
of
his
children
.
He
wrote
to
*NL*
request
that
she
would
send
her
children
away
from
the
great
house
before
*NL*
his
return
,
as
he
expected
to
be
accompanied
by
friends
.
The
woman
could
*NL*
not
read
,
and
was
obliged
to
employ
another
to
read
the
letter
.
The
*NL*
existence
of
the
colored
children
did
not
trouble
this
gentleman
,
it
was
*NL*
only
the
fear
that
friends
might
recognize
in
their
features
a
resemblance
*NL*
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
end
of
six
months
,
a
letter
came
to
my
grandmother
,
from
Brooklyn
.
*NL*
It
was
written
by
a
young
lady
in
the
family
,
and
announced
that
Ellen
had
*NL*
just
arrived
.
It
contained
the
following
message
from
her
:
``
I
do
try
to
do
*NL*
just
as
you
told
me
to
,
and
I
pray
for
you
every
night
and
morning
.
''
I
*NL*
understood
that
these
words
were
meant
for
me
;
and
they
were
a
balsam
to
my
*NL*
heart
.
The
writer
closed
her
letter
by
saying
,
``
Ellen
is
a
nice
little
*NL*
girl
,
and
we
shall
like
to
have
her
with
us
.
My
cousin
,
Mr.
Sands
,
has
*NL*
given
her
to
me
,
to
be
my
little
waiting
maid
.
I
shall
send
her
to
school
,
*NL*
and
I
hope
some
day
she
will
write
to
you
herself
.
''
This
letter
perplexed
*NL*
and
troubled
me
.
Had
my
child
's
father
merely
placed
her
there
till
she
was
*NL*
old
enough
to
support
herself
?
Or
had
he
given
her
to
his
cousin
,
as
a
*NL*
piece
of
property
?
If
the
last
idea
was
correct
,
his
cousin
might
return
to
*NL*
the
south
at
any
time
,
and
hold
Ellen
as
a
slave
.
I
tried
to
put
away
from
*NL*
me
the
painful
thought
that
such
a
foul
wrong
could
have
been
done
to
us
.
I
*NL*
said
to
myself
,
``
Surely
there
must
be
_
some
_
justice
in
man
;
''
then
I
*NL*
remembered
,
with
a
sigh
,
how
slavery
perverted
all
the
natural
feelings
of
*NL*
the
human
heart
.
It
gave
me
a
pang
to
look
on
my
light-hearted
boy
.
He
*NL*
believed
himself
free
;
and
to
have
him
brought
under
the
yoke
of
slavery
,
*NL*
would
be
more
than
I
could
bear
.
How
I
longed
to
have
him
safely
out
of
the
*NL*
reach
of
its
power
!
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XXVIII
.
Aunt
Nancy
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
mentioned
my
great-aunt
,
who
was
a
slave
in
Dr.
Flint
's
family
,
and
*NL*
who
had
been
my
refuge
during
the
shameful
persecutions
I
suffered
from
*NL*
him
.
This
aunt
had
been
married
at
twenty
years
of
age
;
that
is
,
as
far
as
*NL*
slaves
_
can
_
marry
.
She
had
the
consent
of
her
master
and
mistress
,
and
a
*NL*
clergyman
performed
the
ceremony
.
But
it
was
a
mere
form
,
without
any
legal
*NL*
value
.
Her
master
or
mistress
could
annul
it
any
day
they
pleased
.
She
had
*NL*
always
slept
on
the
floor
in
the
entry
,
near
Mrs.
Flint
's
chamber
door
,
*NL*
that
she
might
be
within
call
.
When
she
was
married
,
she
was
told
she
might
*NL*
have
the
use
of
a
small
room
in
an
outhouse
.
Her
mother
and
her
husband
*NL*
furnished
it
.
He
was
a
seafaring
man
,
and
was
allowed
to
sleep
there
when
*NL*
he
was
at
home
.
But
on
the
wedding
evening
,
the
bride
was
ordered
to
her
*NL*
old
post
on
the
entry
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Flint
,
at
that
time
,
had
no
children
;
but
she
was
expecting
to
be
a
*NL*
mother
,
and
if
she
should
want
a
drink
of
water
in
the
night
,
what
could
*NL*
she
do
without
her
slave
to
bring
it
?
So
my
aunt
was
compelled
to
lie
at
*NL*
her
door
,
until
one
midnight
she
was
forced
to
leave
,
to
give
premature
*NL*
birth
to
a
child
.
In
a
fortnight
she
was
required
to
resume
her
place
on
*NL*
the
entry
floor
,
because
Mrs.
Flint
's
babe
needed
her
attentions
.
She
kept
*NL*
her
station
there
through
summer
and
winter
,
until
she
had
given
premature
*NL*
birth
to
six
children
;
and
all
the
while
she
was
employed
as
night-nurse
to
*NL*
Mrs.
Flint
's
children
.
Finally
,
toiling
all
day
,
and
being
deprived
of
rest
*NL*
at
night
,
completely
broke
down
her
constitution
,
and
Dr.
Flint
declared
it
*NL*
was
impossible
she
could
ever
become
the
mother
of
a
living
child
.
The
fear
*NL*
of
losing
so
valuable
a
servant
by
death
,
now
induced
them
to
allow
her
to
*NL*
sleep
in
her
little
room
in
the
out-house
,
except
when
there
was
sickness
*NL*
in
the
family
.
She
afterwards
had
two
feeble
babes
,
one
of
whom
died
in
a
*NL*
few
days
,
and
the
other
in
four
weeks
.
I
well
remember
her
patient
sorrow
*NL*
as
she
held
the
last
dead
baby
in
her
arms
.
``
I
wish
it
could
have
lived
,
''
*NL*
she
said
;
``
it
is
not
the
will
of
God
that
any
of
my
children
should
live
.
*NL*
But
I
will
try
to
be
fit
to
meet
their
little
spirits
in
heaven
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Aunt
Nancy
was
housekeeper
and
waiting-maid
in
Dr.
Flint
's
family
.
Indeed
,
*NL*
she
was
the
_
factotum
_
of
the
household
.
Nothing
went
on
well
without
her
.
*NL*
She
was
my
mother
's
twin
sister
,
and
,
as
far
as
was
in
her
power
,
she
*NL*
supplied
a
mother
's
place
to
us
orphans
.
I
slept
with
her
all
the
time
I
*NL*
lived
in
my
old
master
's
house
,
and
the
bond
between
us
was
very
strong
.
*NL*
When
my
friends
tried
to
discourage
me
from
running
away
;
she
always
*NL*
encouraged
me
.
When
they
thought
I
had
better
return
and
ask
my
master
's
*NL*
pardon
,
because
there
was
no
possibility
of
escape
,
she
sent
me
word
never
*NL*
to
yield
.
She
said
if
I
persevered
I
might
,
perhaps
,
gain
the
freedom
of
my
*NL*
children
;
and
even
if
I
perished
in
doing
it
,
that
was
better
than
to
leave
*NL*
them
to
groan
under
the
same
persecutions
that
had
blighted
my
own
life
.
*NL*
After
I
was
shut
up
in
my
dark
cell
,
she
stole
away
,
whenever
she
could
,
to
*NL*
bring
me
the
news
and
say
something
cheering
.
How
often
did
I
kneel
down
to
*NL*
listen
to
her
words
of
consolation
,
whispered
through
a
crack
!
``
I
am
old
,
*NL*
and
have
not
long
to
live
,
''
she
used
to
say
;
``
and
I
could
die
happy
if
I
*NL*
could
only
see
you
and
the
children
free
.
You
must
pray
to
God
,
Linda
,
as
I
*NL*
do
for
you
,
that
he
will
lead
you
out
of
this
darkness
.
''
I
would
beg
her
*NL*
not
to
worry
herself
on
my
account
;
that
there
was
an
end
of
all
suffering
*NL*
sooner
or
later
,
and
that
whether
I
lived
in
chains
or
in
freedom
,
I
should
*NL*
always
remember
her
as
the
good
friend
who
had
been
the
comfort
of
my
life
.
*NL*
A
word
from
her
always
strengthened
me
;
and
not
me
only
.
The
whole
family
*NL*
relied
upon
her
judgement
,
and
were
guided
by
her
advice
.
I
had
been
in
my
*NL*
cell
six
years
when
my
grandmother
was
summoned
to
the
bedside
of
this
,
her
*NL*
last
remaining
daughter
.
She
was
very
ill
,
and
they
said
she
would
die
.
*NL*
Grandmother
had
not
entered
Dr.
Flint
's
house
for
several
years
.
They
had
*NL*
treated
her
cruelly
,
but
she
thought
nothing
of
that
now
.
She
was
grateful
*NL*
for
permission
to
watch
by
the
death-bed
of
her
child
.
They
had
always
been
*NL*
devoted
to
each
other
;
and
now
they
sat
looking
into
each
other
's
eyes
,
*NL*
longing
to
speak
of
the
secret
that
had
weighed
so
much
on
the
hearts
of
*NL*
both
.
My
aunt
had
been
stricken
with
paralysis
.
She
lived
but
two
days
,
and
*NL*
the
last
day
she
was
speechless
.
Before
she
lost
the
power
of
utterance
,
*NL*
she
told
her
mother
not
to
grieve
if
she
could
not
speak
to
her
;
that
she
*NL*
would
try
to
hold
up
her
hand
;
to
let
her
know
that
all
was
well
with
her
.
*NL*
Even
the
hard-hearted
doctor
was
a
little
softened
when
he
saw
the
dying
*NL*
woman
try
to
smile
on
the
aged
mother
,
who
was
kneeling
by
her
side
.
His
*NL*
eyes
moistened
for
a
moment
,
as
he
said
she
had
always
been
a
faithful
*NL*
servant
,
and
they
should
never
be
able
to
supply
her
place
.
Mrs.
Flint
took
*NL*
to
her
bed
,
quite
overcome
by
the
shock
.
While
my
grandmother
sat
alone
*NL*
with
the
dead
,
the
doctor
came
in
,
leading
his
youngest
son
,
who
had
always
*NL*
been
a
great
pet
with
aunt
Nancy
,
and
was
much
attached
to
her
.
``
Martha
,
''
*NL*
said
he
,
``
aunt
Nancy
loved
this
child
,
and
when
he
comes
where
you
are
,
I
*NL*
hope
you
will
be
kind
to
him
,
for
her
sake
.
''
She
replied
,
``
Your
wife
was
my
*NL*
foster-child
,
Dr.
Flint
,
the
foster-sister
of
my
poor
Nancy
,
and
you
little
*NL*
know
me
if
you
think
I
can
feel
any
thing
but
good
will
for
her
children
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
the
past
could
be
forgotten
,
and
that
we
might
never
think
of
it
,
''
*NL*
said
he
;
``
and
that
Linda
would
come
to
supply
her
aunt
's
place
.
She
would
*NL*
be
worth
more
to
us
than
all
the
money
that
could
be
paid
for
her
.
I
wish
*NL*
it
for
your
sake
also
,
Martha
.
Now
that
Nancy
is
taken
away
from
you
,
she
*NL*
would
be
a
great
comfort
to
your
old
age
.
''
He
knew
he
was
touching
a
*NL*
tender
chord
.
Almost
choking
with
grief
,
my
grandmother
replied
,
``
It
was
*NL*
not
I
that
drove
Linda
away
.
My
grandchildren
are
gone
;
and
of
my
nine
*NL*
children
only
one
is
left
.
God
help
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
me
,
the
death
of
this
kind
relative
was
an
inexpressible
sorrow
.
I
knew
*NL*
that
she
had
been
slowly
murdered
;
and
I
felt
that
my
troubles
had
helped
*NL*
to
finish
the
work
.
After
I
heard
of
her
illness
,
I
listened
constantly
to
*NL*
hear
what
news
was
brought
from
the
great
house
;
and
the
thought
that
I
*NL*
could
not
go
to
her
made
me
utterly
miserable
.
At
last
,
as
uncle
Phillip
*NL*
came
into
the
house
,
I
heard
some
one
inquire
,
``
How
is
she
?
''
and
he
*NL*
answered
,
``
She
is
dead
.
''
My
little
cell
seemed
whirling
round
,
and
I
knew
*NL*
nothing
more
till
I
opened
my
eyes
and
found
uncle
Phillip
bending
over
me
.
*NL*
I
had
no
need
to
ask
any
questions
.
He
whispered
,
``
Linda
,
she
died
happy
.
''
*NL*
I
could
not
weep
.
My
fixed
gaze
troubled
him
.
``
Do
n't
look
_
so
_
''
he
said
.
*NL*
``
Do
n't
add
to
my
poor
mother
's
trouble
.
Remember
how
much
she
has
to
bear
,
*NL*
and
that
we
ought
to
do
all
we
can
to
comfort
her
.
''
Ah
,
yes
,
that
blessed
*NL*
old
grandmother
,
who
for
seventy-three
years
had
borne
the
pelting
storms
*NL*
of
a
slave-mother
's
life
.
She
did
indeed
need
consolation
!
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Flint
had
rendered
her
poor
foster-sister
childless
,
apparently
*NL*
without
any
compunction
;
and
with
cruel
selfishness
had
ruined
her
health
*NL*
by
years
of
incessant
,
unrequited
toil
,
and
broken
rest
.
But
now
she
became
*NL*
very
sentimental
.
I
suppose
she
thought
it
would
be
a
beautiful
*NL*
illustration
of
the
attachment
existing
between
slaveholder
and
slave
,
if
*NL*
the
body
of
her
old
worn-out
servant
was
buried
at
her
feet
.
She
sent
for
*NL*
the
clergyman
and
asked
if
he
had
any
objection
to
burying
aunt
Nancy
in
*NL*
the
doctor
's
family
burial-place
.
No
colored
person
had
ever
been
allowed
*NL*
interment
in
the
white
people
's
burying-ground
,
and
the
minister
knew
that
*NL*
all
the
deceased
of
your
family
reposed
together
in
the
old
graveyard
of
*NL*
the
slaves
.
He
therefore
replied
,
``
I
have
no
objection
to
complying
with
*NL*
your
wish
;
but
perhaps
aunt
Nancy
's
_
mother
_
may
have
some
choice
as
to
*NL*
where
her
remains
shall
be
deposited
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
never
occurred
to
Mrs.
Flint
that
slaves
could
have
any
feelings
.
*NL*
When
my
grandmother
was
consulted
,
she
at
once
said
she
wanted
Nancy
to
lie
*NL*
with
all
the
rest
of
her
family
,
and
where
her
own
old
body
would
be
*NL*
buried
.
Mrs.
Flint
graciously
complied
with
her
wish
,
though
she
said
it
*NL*
was
painful
to
her
to
have
Nancy
buried
away
from
_
her
_
.
She
might
have
*NL*
added
with
touching
pathos
,
``
I
was
so
long
_
used
_
to
sleep
with
her
lying
*NL*
near
me
,
on
the
entry
floor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
uncle
Phillip
asked
permission
to
bury
his
sister
at
his
own
expense
;
*NL*
and
slaveholders
are
always
ready
to
grant
_
such
_
favors
to
slaves
and
*NL*
their
relatives
.
The
arrangements
were
very
plain
,
but
perfectly
*NL*
respectable
.
She
was
buried
on
the
Sabbath
,
and
Mrs.
Flint
's
minister
read
*NL*
the
funeral
service
.
There
was
a
large
concourse
of
colored
people
,
bond
*NL*
and
free
,
and
a
few
white
persons
who
had
always
been
friendly
to
our
*NL*
family
.
Dr.
Flint
's
carriage
was
in
the
procession
;
and
when
the
body
was
*NL*
deposited
in
its
humble
resting
place
,
the
mistress
dropped
a
tear
,
and
*NL*
returned
to
her
carriage
,
probably
thinking
she
had
performed
her
duty
*NL*
nobly
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
talked
of
by
the
slaves
as
a
mighty
grand
funeral
.
Northern
*NL*
travellers
,
passing
through
the
place
,
might
have
described
this
tribute
of
*NL*
respect
to
the
humble
dead
as
a
beautiful
feature
in
the
``
patriarchal
*NL*
institution
;
''
a
touching
proof
of
the
attachment
between
slaveholders
and
*NL*
their
servants
;
and
tender-hearted
Mrs.
Flint
would
have
confirmed
this
*NL*
impression
,
with
handkerchief
at
her
eyes
.
_
We
_
could
have
told
them
a
*NL*
different
story
.
We
could
have
given
them
a
chapter
of
wrongs
and
*NL*
sufferings
,
that
would
have
touched
their
hearts
,
if
they
_
had
_
any
hearts
*NL*
to
feel
for
the
colored
people
.
We
could
have
told
them
how
the
poor
old
*NL*
slave-mother
had
toiled
,
year
after
year
,
to
earn
eight
hundred
dollars
to
*NL*
buy
her
son
Phillip
's
right
to
his
own
earnings
;
and
how
that
same
Phillip
*NL*
paid
the
expenses
of
the
funeral
,
which
they
regarded
as
doing
so
much
*NL*
credit
to
the
master
.
We
could
also
have
told
them
of
a
poor
,
blighted
*NL*
young
creature
,
shut
up
in
a
living
grave
for
years
,
to
avoid
the
tortures
*NL*
that
would
be
inflicted
on
her
,
if
she
ventured
to
come
out
and
look
on
the
*NL*
face
of
her
departed
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
,
and
much
more
,
I
thought
of
,
as
I
sat
at
my
loophole
,
waiting
*NL*
for
the
family
to
return
from
the
grave
;
sometimes
weeping
,
sometimes
*NL*
falling
asleep
,
dreaming
strange
dreams
of
the
dead
and
the
living
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
sad
to
witness
the
grief
of
my
bereaved
grandmother
.
She
had
always
*NL*
been
strong
to
bear
,
and
now
,
as
ever
,
religious
faith
supported
her
.
But
*NL*
her
dark
life
had
become
still
darker
,
and
age
and
trouble
were
leaving
*NL*
deep
traces
on
her
withered
face
.
She
had
four
places
to
knock
for
me
to
*NL*
come
to
the
trapdoor
,
and
each
place
had
a
different
meaning
.
She
now
came
*NL*
oftener
than
she
had
done
,
and
talked
to
me
of
her
dead
daughter
,
while
*NL*
tears
trickled
slowly
down
her
furrowed
cheeks
.
I
said
all
I
could
to
*NL*
comfort
her
;
but
it
was
a
sad
reflection
,
that
instead
of
being
able
to
*NL*
help
her
,
I
was
a
constant
source
of
anxiety
and
trouble
.
The
poor
old
back
*NL*
was
fitted
to
its
burden
.
It
bent
under
it
,
but
did
not
break
.
*NL*

XXIX
.
Preparations
For
Escape
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
hardly
expect
that
the
reader
will
credit
me
,
when
I
affirm
that
I
lived
*NL*
in
that
little
dismal
hole
,
almost
deprived
of
light
and
air
,
and
with
no
*NL*
space
to
move
my
limbs
,
for
nearly
seven
years
.
But
it
is
a
fact
;
and
to
me
*NL*
a
sad
one
,
even
now
;
for
my
body
still
suffers
from
the
effects
of
that
*NL*
long
imprisonment
,
to
say
nothing
of
my
soul
.
Members
of
my
family
,
now
*NL*
living
in
New
York
and
Boston
,
can
testify
to
the
truth
of
what
I
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
Countless
were
the
nights
that
I
sat
late
at
the
little
loophole
scarcely
*NL*
large
enough
to
give
me
a
glimpse
of
one
twinkling
star
.
There
,
heard
the
*NL*
patrols
and
slave-hunters
conferring
together
about
the
capture
of
*NL*
runaways
,
well
knowing
how
rejoiced
they
would
be
to
catch
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Season
after
season
,
year
after
year
,
I
peeped
at
my
children
's
faces
,
and
*NL*
heard
their
sweet
voices
,
with
a
heart
yearning
all
the
while
to
say
,
``
Your
*NL*
mother
is
here
.
''
Sometimes
it
appeared
to
me
as
if
ages
had
rolled
away
*NL*
since
I
entered
upon
that
gloomy
,
monotonous
existence
.
At
times
,
I
was
*NL*
stupefied
and
listless
;
at
other
times
I
became
very
impatient
to
know
when
*NL*
these
dark
years
would
end
,
and
I
should
again
be
allowed
to
feel
the
*NL*
sunshine
,
and
breathe
the
pure
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
Ellen
left
us
,
this
feeling
increased
.
Mr.
Sands
had
agreed
that
*NL*
Benny
might
go
to
the
north
whenever
his
uncle
Phillip
could
go
with
him
;
*NL*
and
I
was
anxious
to
be
there
also
,
to
watch
over
my
children
,
and
protect
*NL*
them
so
far
as
I
was
able
.
Moreover
,
I
was
likely
to
be
drowned
out
of
my
*NL*
den
,
if
I
remained
much
longer
;
for
the
slight
roof
was
getting
badly
out
*NL*
of
repair
,
and
uncle
Phillip
was
afraid
to
remove
the
shingles
,
lest
some
*NL*
one
should
get
a
glimpse
of
me
.
When
storms
occurred
in
the
night
,
they
*NL*
spread
mats
and
bits
of
carpet
,
which
in
the
morning
appeared
to
have
been
*NL*
laid
out
to
dry
;
but
to
cover
the
roof
in
the
daytime
might
have
attracted
*NL*
attention
.
Consequently
,
my
clothes
and
bedding
were
often
drenched
;
a
*NL*
process
by
which
the
pains
and
aches
in
my
cramped
and
stiffened
limbs
were
*NL*
greatly
increased
.
I
revolved
various
plans
of
escape
in
my
mind
,
which
I
*NL*
sometimes
imparted
to
my
grandmother
,
when
she
came
to
whisper
with
me
at
*NL*
the
trap-door
.
The
kind-hearted
old
woman
had
an
intense
sympathy
for
*NL*
runaways
.
She
had
known
too
much
of
the
cruelties
inflicted
on
those
who
*NL*
were
captured
.
Her
memory
always
flew
back
at
once
to
the
sufferings
of
her
*NL*
bright
and
handsome
son
,
Benjamin
,
the
youngest
and
dearest
of
her
flock
.
*NL*
So
,
whenever
I
alluded
to
the
subject
,
she
would
groan
out
,
``
O
,
do
n't
think
*NL*
of
it
,
child
.
You
'll
break
my
heart
.
''
I
had
no
good
old
aunt
Nancy
now
to
*NL*
encourage
me
;
but
my
brother
William
and
my
children
were
continually
*NL*
beckoning
me
to
the
north
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
I
must
go
back
a
few
months
in
my
story
.
I
have
stated
that
the
*NL*
first
of
January
was
the
time
for
selling
slaves
,
or
leasing
them
out
to
*NL*
new
masters
.
If
time
were
counted
by
heart-throbs
,
the
poor
slaves
might
*NL*
reckon
years
of
suffering
during
that
festival
so
joyous
to
the
free
.
On
*NL*
the
New
Year
's
day
preceding
my
aunt
's
death
,
one
of
my
friends
,
named
*NL*
Fanny
,
was
to
be
sold
at
auction
,
to
pay
her
master
's
debts
.
My
thoughts
*NL*
were
with
her
during
all
the
day
,
and
at
night
I
anxiously
inquired
what
*NL*
had
been
her
fate
.
I
was
told
that
she
had
been
sold
to
one
master
,
and
her
*NL*
four
little
girls
to
another
master
,
far
distant
;
that
she
had
escaped
from
*NL*
her
purchaser
,
and
was
not
to
be
found
.
Her
mother
was
the
old
Aggie
I
have
*NL*
spoken
of
.
She
lived
in
a
small
tenement
belonging
to
my
grandmother
,
and
*NL*
built
on
the
same
lot
with
her
own
house
.
Her
dwelling
was
searched
and
*NL*
watched
,
and
that
brought
the
patrols
so
near
me
that
I
was
obliged
to
keep
*NL*
very
close
in
my
den
.
The
hunters
were
somehow
eluded
;
and
not
long
*NL*
afterwards
Benny
accidentally
caught
sight
of
Fanny
in
her
mother
's
hut
.
He
*NL*
told
his
grandmother
,
who
charged
him
never
to
speak
of
it
,
explaining
to
*NL*
him
the
frightful
consequences
;
and
he
never
betrayed
the
trust
.
Aggie
*NL*
little
dreamed
that
my
grandmother
knew
where
her
daughter
was
concealed
,
*NL*
and
that
the
stooping
form
of
her
old
neighbor
was
bending
under
a
similar
*NL*
burden
of
anxiety
and
fear
;
but
these
dangerous
secrets
deepened
the
*NL*
sympathy
between
the
two
old
persecuted
mothers
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
friend
Fanny
and
I
remained
many
weeks
hidden
within
call
of
each
other
;
*NL*
but
she
was
unconscious
of
the
fact
.
I
longed
to
have
her
share
my
den
,
*NL*
which
seemed
a
more
secure
retreat
than
her
own
;
but
I
had
brought
so
much
*NL*
trouble
on
my
grandmother
,
that
it
seemed
wrong
to
ask
her
to
incur
greater
*NL*
risks
.
My
restlessness
increased
.
I
had
lived
too
long
in
bodily
pain
and
*NL*
anguish
of
spirit
.
Always
I
was
in
dread
that
by
some
accident
,
or
some
*NL*
contrivance
,
slavery
would
succeed
in
snatching
my
children
from
me
.
This
*NL*
thought
drove
me
nearly
frantic
,
and
I
determined
to
steer
for
the
North
*NL*
Star
at
all
hazards
.
At
this
crisis
,
Providence
opened
an
unexpected
way
*NL*
for
me
to
escape
.
My
friend
Peter
came
one
evening
,
and
asked
to
speak
with
*NL*
me
.
``
Your
day
has
come
,
Linda
,
''
said
he
.
``
I
have
found
a
chance
for
you
to
*NL*
go
to
the
Free
States
.
You
have
a
fortnight
to
decide
.
''
The
news
seemed
too
*NL*
good
to
be
true
;
but
Peter
explained
his
arrangements
,
and
told
me
all
that
*NL*
was
necessary
was
for
me
to
say
I
would
go
.
I
was
going
to
answer
him
with
*NL*
a
joyful
yes
,
when
the
thought
of
Benny
came
to
my
mind
.
I
told
him
the
*NL*
temptation
was
exceedingly
strong
,
but
I
was
terribly
afraid
of
Dr.
Flint
's
*NL*
alleged
power
over
my
child
,
and
that
I
could
not
go
and
leave
him
behind
.
*NL*
Peter
remonstrated
earnestly
.
He
said
such
a
good
chance
might
never
occur
*NL*
again
;
that
Benny
was
free
,
and
could
be
sent
to
me
;
and
that
for
the
sake
*NL*
of
my
children
's
welfare
I
ought
not
to
hesitate
a
moment
.
I
told
him
I
*NL*
would
consult
with
uncle
Phillip
.
My
uncle
rejoiced
in
the
plan
,
and
bade
*NL*
me
go
by
all
means
.
He
promised
,
if
his
life
was
spared
,
that
he
would
*NL*
either
bring
or
send
my
son
to
me
as
soon
as
I
reached
a
place
of
safety
.
I
*NL*
resolved
to
go
,
but
thought
nothing
had
better
be
said
to
my
grandmother
*NL*
till
very
near
the
time
of
departure
.
But
my
uncle
thought
she
would
feel
*NL*
it
more
keenly
if
I
left
here
so
suddenly
.
``
I
will
reason
with
her
,
''
said
*NL*
he
,
``
and
convince
her
how
necessary
it
is
,
not
only
for
your
sake
,
but
for
*NL*
hers
also
.
You
can
not
be
blind
to
the
fact
that
she
is
sinking
under
her
*NL*
burdens
.
''
I
was
not
blind
to
it
.
I
knew
that
my
concealment
was
an
*NL*
ever-present
source
of
anxiety
,
and
that
the
older
she
grew
the
more
*NL*
nervously
fearful
she
was
of
discovery
.
My
uncle
talked
with
her
,
and
*NL*
finally
succeeded
in
persuading
her
that
it
was
absolutely
necessary
for
me
*NL*
to
seize
the
chance
so
unexpectedly
offered
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
anticipation
of
being
a
free
woman
proved
almost
too
much
for
my
weak
*NL*
frame
.
The
excitement
stimulated
me
,
and
at
the
same
time
bewildered
me
.
I
*NL*
made
busy
preparations
for
my
journey
,
and
for
my
son
to
follow
me
.
I
*NL*
resolved
to
have
an
interview
with
him
before
I
went
,
that
I
might
give
him
*NL*
cautions
and
advice
,
and
tell
him
how
anxiously
I
should
be
waiting
for
him
*NL*
at
the
north
.
Grandmother
stole
up
to
me
as
often
as
possible
to
whisper
*NL*
words
of
counsel
.
She
insisted
upon
writing
to
Dr.
Flint
,
as
soon
as
I
*NL*
arrived
in
the
Free
States
,
and
asking
him
to
sell
me
to
her
.
She
said
she
*NL*
would
sacrifice
her
house
,
and
all
she
had
in
the
world
,
for
the
sake
of
*NL*
having
me
safe
with
my
children
in
any
part
of
the
world
.
If
she
could
only
*NL*
live
to
know
_
that
_
she
could
die
in
peace
.
I
promised
the
dear
old
*NL*
faithful
friend
that
I
would
write
to
her
as
soon
as
I
arrived
,
and
put
the
*NL*
letter
in
a
safe
way
to
reach
her
;
but
in
my
own
mind
I
resolved
that
not
*NL*
another
cent
of
her
hard
earnings
should
be
spent
to
pay
rapacious
*NL*
slaveholders
for
what
they
called
their
property
.
And
even
if
I
had
not
*NL*
been
unwilling
to
buy
what
I
had
already
a
right
to
possess
,
common
*NL*
humanity
would
have
prevented
me
from
accepting
the
generous
offer
,
at
the
*NL*
expense
of
turning
my
aged
relative
out
of
house
and
home
,
when
she
was
*NL*
trembling
on
the
brink
of
the
grave
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
to
escape
in
a
vessel
;
but
I
forbear
to
mention
any
further
*NL*
particulars
.
I
was
in
readiness
,
but
the
vessel
was
unexpectedly
detained
*NL*
several
days
.
Meantime
,
news
came
to
town
of
a
most
horrible
murder
*NL*
committed
on
a
fugitive
slave
,
named
James
.
Charity
,
the
mother
of
this
*NL*
unfortunate
young
man
,
had
been
an
old
acquaintance
of
ours
.
I
have
told
*NL*
the
shocking
particulars
of
his
death
,
in
my
description
of
some
of
the
*NL*
neighboring
slaveholders
.
My
grandmother
,
always
nervously
sensitive
about
*NL*
runaways
,
was
terribly
frightened
.
She
felt
sure
that
a
similar
fate
*NL*
awaited
me
,
if
I
did
not
desist
from
my
enterprise
.
She
sobbed
,
and
*NL*
groaned
,
and
entreated
me
not
to
go
.
Her
excessive
fear
was
somewhat
*NL*
contagious
,
and
my
heart
was
not
proof
against
her
extreme
agony
.
I
was
*NL*
grievously
disappointed
,
but
I
promised
to
relinquish
my
project
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
my
friend
Peter
was
apprised
of
this
,
he
was
both
disappointed
and
*NL*
vexed
.
He
said
,
that
judging
from
our
past
experience
,
it
would
be
a
long
*NL*
time
before
I
had
such
another
chance
to
throw
away
.
I
told
him
it
need
not
*NL*
be
thrown
away
;
that
I
had
a
friend
concealed
near
by
,
who
would
be
glad
*NL*
enough
to
take
the
place
that
had
been
provided
for
me
.
I
told
him
about
*NL*
poor
Fanny
,
and
the
kind-hearted
,
noble
fellow
,
who
never
turned
his
back
*NL*
upon
any
body
in
distress
,
white
or
black
,
expressed
his
readiness
to
help
*NL*
her
.
Aggie
was
much
surprised
when
she
found
that
we
knew
her
secret
.
She
*NL*
was
rejoiced
to
hear
of
such
a
chance
for
Fanny
,
and
arrangements
were
made
*NL*
for
her
to
go
on
board
the
vessel
the
next
night
.
They
both
supposed
that
I
*NL*
had
long
been
at
the
north
,
therefore
my
name
was
not
mentioned
in
the
*NL*
transaction
.
Fanny
was
carried
on
board
at
the
appointed
time
,
and
stowed
*NL*
away
in
a
very
small
cabin
.
This
accommodation
had
been
purchased
at
a
*NL*
price
that
would
pay
for
a
voyage
to
England
.
But
when
one
proposes
to
go
*NL*
to
fine
old
England
,
they
stop
to
calculate
whether
they
can
afford
the
*NL*
cost
of
the
pleasure
;
while
in
making
a
bargain
to
escape
from
slavery
,
the
*NL*
trembling
victim
is
ready
to
say
,
``
take
all
I
have
,
only
do
n't
betray
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
I
peeped
through
my
loophole
,
and
saw
that
it
was
dark
and
*NL*
cloudy
.
At
night
I
received
news
that
the
wind
was
ahead
,
and
the
vessel
*NL*
had
not
sailed
.
I
was
exceedingly
anxious
about
Fanny
,
and
Peter
too
,
who
*NL*
was
running
a
tremendous
risk
at
my
instigation
.
Next
day
the
wind
and
*NL*
weather
remained
the
same
.
Poor
Fanny
had
been
half
dead
with
fright
when
*NL*
they
carried
her
on
board
,
and
I
could
readily
imagine
how
she
must
be
*NL*
suffering
now
.
Grandmother
came
often
to
my
den
,
to
say
how
thankful
she
*NL*
was
I
did
not
go
.
On
the
third
morning
she
rapped
for
me
to
come
down
to
*NL*
the
storeroom
.
The
poor
old
sufferer
was
breaking
down
under
her
weight
of
*NL*
trouble
.
She
was
easily
flurried
now
.
I
found
her
in
a
nervous
,
excited
*NL*
state
,
but
I
was
not
aware
that
she
had
forgotten
to
lock
the
door
behind
*NL*
her
,
as
usual
.
She
was
exceedingly
worried
about
the
detention
of
the
*NL*
vessel
.
She
was
afraid
all
would
be
discovered
,
and
then
Fanny
,
and
Peter
,
*NL*
and
I
,
would
all
be
tortured
to
death
,
and
Phillip
would
be
utterly
ruined
,
*NL*
and
her
house
would
be
torn
down
.
Poor
Peter
!
If
he
should
die
such
a
*NL*
horrible
death
as
the
poor
slave
James
had
lately
done
,
and
all
for
his
*NL*
kindness
in
trying
to
help
me
,
how
dreadful
it
would
be
for
us
all
!
Alas
,
*NL*
the
thought
was
familiar
to
me
,
and
had
sent
many
a
sharp
pang
through
my
*NL*
heart
.
I
tried
to
suppress
my
own
anxiety
,
and
speak
soothingly
to
her
.
She
*NL*
brought
in
some
allusion
to
aunt
Nancy
,
the
dear
daughter
she
had
recently
*NL*
buried
,
and
then
she
lost
all
control
of
herself
.
As
she
stood
there
,
*NL*
trembling
and
sobbing
,
a
voice
from
the
piazza
called
out
,
``
Whar
is
you
,
*NL*
aunt
Marthy
?
''
Grandmother
was
startled
,
and
in
her
agitation
opened
the
*NL*
door
,
without
thinking
of
me
.
In
stepped
Jenny
,
the
mischievous
housemaid
,
*NL*
who
had
tried
to
enter
my
room
,
when
I
was
concealed
in
the
house
of
my
*NL*
white
benefactress
.
``
I
's
bin
huntin
ebery
whar
for
you
,
aunt
Marthy
,
''
said
*NL*
she
.
``
My
missis
wants
you
to
send
her
some
crackers
.
''
I
had
slunk
down
*NL*
behind
a
barrel
,
which
entirely
screened
me
,
but
I
imagined
that
Jenny
was
*NL*
looking
directly
at
the
spot
,
and
my
heart
beat
violently
.
My
grandmother
*NL*
immediately
thought
what
she
had
done
,
and
went
out
quickly
with
Jenny
to
*NL*
count
the
crackers
locking
the
door
after
her
.
She
returned
to
me
,
in
a
few
*NL*
minutes
,
the
perfect
picture
of
despair
.
``
Poor
child
!
''
she
exclaimed
,
``
my
*NL*
carelessness
has
ruined
you
.
The
boat
ai
n't
gone
yet
.
Get
ready
*NL*
immediately
,
and
go
with
Fanny
.
I
ai
n't
got
another
word
to
say
against
it
*NL*
now
;
for
there
's
no
telling
what
may
happen
this
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Uncle
Phillip
was
sent
for
,
and
he
agreed
with
his
mother
in
thinking
that
*NL*
Jenny
would
inform
Dr.
Flint
in
less
than
twenty-four
hours
.
He
advised
*NL*
getting
me
on
board
the
boat
,
if
possible
;
if
not
,
I
had
better
keep
very
*NL*
still
in
my
den
,
where
they
could
not
find
me
without
tearing
the
house
*NL*
down
.
He
said
it
would
not
do
for
him
to
move
in
the
matter
,
because
*NL*
suspicion
would
be
immediately
excited
;
but
he
promised
to
communicate
with
*NL*
Peter
.
I
felt
reluctant
to
apply
to
him
again
,
having
implicated
him
too
*NL*
much
already
;
but
there
seemed
to
be
no
alternative
.
Vexed
as
Peter
had
*NL*
been
by
my
indecision
,
he
was
true
to
his
generous
nature
,
and
said
at
once
*NL*
that
he
would
do
his
best
to
help
me
,
trusting
I
should
show
myself
a
*NL*
stronger
woman
this
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
immediately
proceeded
to
the
wharf
,
and
found
that
the
wind
had
shifted
,
*NL*
and
the
vessel
was
slowly
beating
down
stream
.
On
some
pretext
of
urgent
*NL*
necessity
,
he
offered
two
boatmen
a
dollar
apiece
to
catch
up
with
her
.
He
*NL*
was
of
lighter
complexion
than
the
boatmen
he
hired
,
and
when
the
captain
*NL*
saw
them
coming
so
rapidly
,
he
thought
officers
were
pursuing
his
vessel
in
*NL*
search
of
the
runaway
slave
he
had
on
board
.
They
hoisted
sails
,
but
the
*NL*
boat
gained
upon
them
,
and
the
indefatigable
Peter
sprang
on
board
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
at
once
recognized
him
.
Peter
asked
him
to
go
below
,
to
speak
*NL*
about
a
bad
bill
he
had
given
him
.
When
he
told
his
errand
,
the
captain
*NL*
replied
,
``
Why
,
the
woman
's
here
already
;
and
I
've
put
her
where
you
or
the
*NL*
devil
would
have
a
tough
job
to
find
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
is
another
woman
I
want
to
bring
,
''
said
Peter
.
''
_
She
_
is
in
great
*NL*
distress
,
too
,
and
you
shall
be
paid
any
thing
within
reason
,
if
you
'll
*NL*
stop
and
take
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
her
name
?
''
inquired
the
captain
.
``
Linda
,
''
he
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
name
of
the
woman
already
here
,
''
rejoined
the
captain
.
``
By
*NL*
George
!
I
believe
you
mean
to
betray
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
!
''
exclaimed
Peter
,
``
God
knows
I
would
n't
harm
a
hair
of
your
head
.
I
am
*NL*
too
grateful
to
you
.
But
there
really
_
is
_
another
woman
in
great
danger
.
*NL*
Do
have
the
humanity
to
stop
and
take
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
while
they
came
to
an
understanding
.
Fanny
,
not
dreaming
I
was
any
*NL*
where
about
in
that
region
,
had
assumed
my
name
,
though
she
called
herself
*NL*
Johnson
.
``
Linda
is
a
common
name
,
''
said
Peter
,
``
and
the
woman
I
want
to
*NL*
bring
is
Linda
Brent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
agreed
to
wait
at
a
certain
place
till
evening
,
being
*NL*
handsomely
paid
for
his
detention
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
,
the
day
was
an
anxious
one
for
us
all
.
But
we
concluded
that
if
*NL*
Jenny
had
seen
me
,
she
would
be
too
wise
to
let
her
mistress
know
of
it
;
*NL*
and
that
she
probably
would
not
get
a
chance
to
see
Dr.
Flint
's
family
till
*NL*
evening
,
for
I
knew
very
well
what
were
the
rules
in
that
household
.
I
*NL*
afterwards
believed
that
she
did
not
see
me
;
for
nothing
ever
came
of
it
,
*NL*
and
she
was
one
of
those
base
characters
that
would
have
jumped
to
betray
a
*NL*
suffering
fellow
being
for
the
sake
of
thirty
pieces
of
silver
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
made
all
my
arrangements
to
go
on
board
as
soon
as
it
was
dusk
.
The
*NL*
intervening
time
I
resolved
to
spend
with
my
son
.
I
had
not
spoken
to
him
*NL*
for
seven
years
,
though
I
had
been
under
the
same
roof
,
and
seen
him
every
*NL*
day
,
when
I
was
well
enough
to
sit
at
the
loophole
.
I
did
not
dare
to
*NL*
venture
beyond
the
storeroom
;
so
they
brought
him
there
,
and
locked
us
up
*NL*
together
,
in
a
place
concealed
from
the
piazza
door
.
It
was
an
agitating
*NL*
interview
for
both
of
us
.
After
we
had
talked
and
wept
together
for
a
*NL*
little
while
,
he
said
,
``
Mother
,
I
'm
glad
you
're
going
away
.
I
wish
I
could
*NL*
go
with
you
.
I
knew
you
was
here
;
and
I
have
been
_
so
_
afraid
they
would
*NL*
come
and
catch
you
!
''
I
was
greatly
surprised
,
and
asked
him
how
he
had
*NL*
found
it
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
replied
,
``
I
was
standing
under
the
eaves
,
one
day
,
before
Ellen
went
*NL*
away
,
and
I
heard
somebody
cough
up
over
the
wood
shed
.
I
do
n't
know
what
*NL*
made
me
think
it
was
you
,
but
I
did
think
so
.
I
missed
Ellen
,
the
night
*NL*
before
she
went
away
;
and
grandmother
brought
her
back
into
the
room
in
the
*NL*
night
;
and
I
thought
maybe
she
'd
been
to
see
_
you
_
,
before
she
went
,
for
I
*NL*
heard
grandmother
whisper
to
her
,
`
Now
go
to
sleep
;
and
remember
never
to
*NL*
tell
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
asked
him
if
he
ever
mentioned
his
suspicions
to
his
sister
.
He
said
he
*NL*
never
did
;
but
after
he
heard
the
cough
,
if
he
saw
her
playing
with
other
*NL*
children
on
that
side
of
the
house
,
he
always
tried
to
coax
her
round
to
*NL*
the
other
side
,
for
fear
they
would
hear
me
cough
,
too
.
He
said
he
had
kept
*NL*
a
close
lookout
for
Dr.
Flint
,
and
if
he
saw
him
speak
to
a
constable
,
or
a
*NL*
patrol
,
he
always
told
grandmother
.
I
now
recollected
that
I
had
seen
him
*NL*
manifest
uneasiness
,
when
people
were
on
that
side
of
the
house
,
and
I
had
*NL*
at
the
time
been
puzzled
to
conjecture
a
motive
for
his
actions
.
Such
*NL*
prudence
may
seem
extraordinary
in
a
boy
of
twelve
years
,
but
slaves
,
being
*NL*
surrounded
by
mysteries
,
deceptions
,
and
dangers
,
early
learn
to
be
*NL*
suspicious
and
watchful
,
and
prematurely
cautious
and
cunning
.
He
had
never
*NL*
asked
a
question
of
grandmother
,
or
uncle
Phillip
,
and
I
had
often
heard
*NL*
him
chime
in
with
other
children
,
when
they
spoke
of
my
being
at
the
north
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
I
was
now
really
going
to
the
Free
States
,
and
if
he
was
a
good
,
*NL*
honest
boy
,
and
a
loving
child
to
his
dear
old
grandmother
,
the
Lord
would
*NL*
bless
him
,
and
bring
him
to
me
,
and
we
and
Ellen
would
live
together
.
He
*NL*
began
to
tell
me
that
grandmother
had
not
eaten
any
thing
all
day
.
While
he
*NL*
was
speaking
,
the
door
was
unlocked
,
and
she
came
in
with
a
small
bag
of
*NL*
money
,
which
she
wanted
me
to
take
.
I
begged
her
to
keep
a
part
of
it
,
at
*NL*
least
,
to
pay
for
Benny
's
being
sent
to
the
north
;
but
she
insisted
,
while
*NL*
her
tears
were
falling
fast
,
that
I
should
take
the
whole
.
``
You
may
be
sick
*NL*
among
strangers
,
''
she
said
,
``
and
they
would
send
you
to
the
poorhouse
to
*NL*
die
.
''
Ah
,
that
good
grandmother
!
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
last
time
I
went
up
to
my
nook
.
Its
desolate
appearance
no
longer
*NL*
chilled
me
,
for
the
light
of
hope
had
risen
in
my
soul
.
Yet
,
even
with
the
*NL*
blessed
prospect
of
freedom
before
me
,
I
felt
very
sad
at
leaving
forever
*NL*
that
old
homestead
,
where
I
had
been
sheltered
so
long
by
the
dear
old
*NL*
grandmother
;
where
I
had
dreamed
my
first
young
dream
of
love
;
and
where
,
*NL*
after
that
had
faded
away
,
my
children
came
to
twine
themselves
so
closely
*NL*
round
my
desolate
heart
.
As
the
hour
approached
for
me
to
leave
,
I
again
*NL*
descended
to
the
storeroom
.
My
grandmother
and
Benny
were
there
.
She
took
*NL*
me
by
the
hand
,
and
said
,
``
Linda
,
let
us
pray
.
''
We
knelt
down
together
,
*NL*
with
my
child
pressed
to
my
heart
,
and
my
other
arm
round
the
faithful
,
*NL*
loving
old
friend
I
was
about
to
leave
forever
.
On
no
other
occasion
has
it
*NL*
ever
been
my
lot
to
listen
to
so
fervent
a
supplication
for
mercy
and
*NL*
protection
.
It
thrilled
through
my
heart
,
and
inspired
me
with
trust
in
*NL*
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
Peter
was
waiting
for
me
in
the
street
.
I
was
soon
by
his
side
,
faint
in
*NL*
body
,
but
strong
of
purpose
.
I
did
not
look
back
upon
the
old
place
,
though
*NL*
I
felt
that
I
should
never
see
it
again
.

Northward
Bound
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
never
could
tell
how
we
reached
the
wharf
.
My
brain
was
all
of
a
whirl
,
*NL*
and
my
limbs
tottered
under
me
.
At
an
appointed
place
we
met
my
uncle
*NL*
Phillip
,
who
had
started
before
us
on
a
different
route
,
that
he
might
*NL*
reach
the
wharf
first
,
and
give
us
timely
warning
if
there
was
any
danger
.
*NL*
A
row-boat
was
in
readiness
.
As
I
was
about
to
step
in
,
I
felt
something
*NL*
pull
me
gently
,
and
turning
round
I
saw
Benny
,
looking
pale
and
anxious
.
He
*NL*
whispered
in
my
ear
,
``
I
've
been
peeping
into
the
doctor
's
window
,
and
he
's
*NL*
at
home
.
Good
by
,
mother
.
Do
n't
cry
;
I
'll
come
.
''
He
hastened
away
.
I
*NL*
clasped
the
hand
of
my
good
uncle
,
to
whom
I
owed
so
much
,
and
of
Peter
,
*NL*
the
brave
,
generous
friend
who
had
volunteered
to
run
such
terrible
risks
*NL*
to
secure
my
safety
.
To
this
day
I
remember
how
his
bright
face
beamed
with
*NL*
joy
,
when
he
told
me
he
had
discovered
a
safe
method
for
me
to
escape
.
Yet
*NL*
that
intelligent
,
enterprising
,
noble-hearted
man
was
a
chattel
!
Liable
,
by
*NL*
the
laws
of
a
country
that
calls
itself
civilized
,
to
be
sold
with
horses
*NL*
and
pigs
!
We
parted
in
silence
.
Our
hearts
were
all
too
full
for
words
!
*NL*
*NL*
Swiftly
the
boat
glided
over
the
water
.
After
a
while
,
one
of
the
sailors
*NL*
said
,
``
Do
n't
be
down-hearted
,
madam
.
We
will
take
you
safely
to
your
*NL*
husband
,
in
--
.
''
At
first
I
could
not
imagine
what
he
meant
;
but
I
had
*NL*
presence
of
mind
to
think
that
it
probably
referred
to
something
the
*NL*
captain
had
told
him
;
so
I
thanked
him
,
and
said
I
hoped
we
should
have
*NL*
pleasant
weather
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
entered
the
vessel
the
captain
came
forward
to
meet
me
.
He
was
an
*NL*
elderly
man
,
with
a
pleasant
countenance
.
He
showed
me
to
a
little
box
of
a
*NL*
cabin
,
where
sat
my
friend
Fanny
.
She
started
as
if
she
had
seen
a
spectre
.
*NL*
She
gazed
on
me
in
utter
astonishment
,
and
exclaimed
,
``
Linda
,
can
this
be
*NL*
_
you
_
?
or
is
it
your
ghost
?
''
When
we
were
locked
in
each
other
's
arms
,
my
*NL*
overwrought
feelings
could
no
longer
be
restrained
.
My
sobs
reached
the
*NL*
ears
of
the
captain
,
who
came
and
very
kindly
reminded
us
,
that
for
his
*NL*
safety
,
as
well
as
our
own
,
it
would
be
prudent
for
us
not
to
attract
any
*NL*
attention
.
He
said
that
when
there
was
a
sail
in
sight
he
wished
us
to
keep
*NL*
below
;
but
at
other
times
,
he
had
no
objection
to
our
being
on
deck
.
He
*NL*
assured
us
that
he
would
keep
a
good
lookout
,
and
if
we
acted
prudently
,
he
*NL*
thought
we
should
be
in
no
danger
.
He
had
represented
us
as
women
going
to
*NL*
meet
our
husbands
in
--
.
We
thanked
him
,
and
promised
to
observe
*NL*
carefully
all
the
directions
he
gave
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
and
I
now
talked
by
ourselves
,
low
and
quietly
,
in
our
little
cabin
.
*NL*
She
told
me
of
the
suffering
she
had
gone
through
in
making
her
escape
,
and
*NL*
of
her
terrors
while
she
was
concealed
in
her
mother
's
house
.
Above
all
,
*NL*
she
dwelt
on
the
agony
of
separation
from
all
her
children
on
that
dreadful
*NL*
auction
day
.
She
could
scarcely
credit
me
,
when
I
told
her
of
the
place
*NL*
where
I
had
passed
nearly
seven
years
.
``
We
have
the
same
sorrows
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
``
No
,
''
replied
she
,
``
you
are
going
to
see
your
children
soon
,
and
there
is
*NL*
no
hope
that
I
shall
ever
even
hear
from
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
vessel
was
soon
under
way
,
but
we
made
slow
progress
.
The
wind
was
*NL*
against
us
,
I
should
not
have
cared
for
this
,
if
we
had
been
out
of
sight
*NL*
of
the
town
;
but
until
there
were
miles
of
water
between
us
and
our
*NL*
enemies
,
we
were
filled
with
constant
apprehensions
that
the
constables
*NL*
would
come
on
board
.
Neither
could
I
feel
quite
at
ease
with
the
captain
*NL*
and
his
men
.
I
was
an
entire
stranger
to
that
class
of
people
,
and
I
had
*NL*
heard
that
sailors
were
rough
,
and
sometimes
cruel
.
We
were
so
completely
*NL*
in
their
power
,
that
if
they
were
bad
men
,
our
situation
would
be
dreadful
.
*NL*
Now
that
the
captain
was
paid
for
our
passage
,
might
he
not
be
tempted
to
*NL*
make
more
money
by
giving
us
up
to
those
who
claimed
us
as
property
?
I
was
*NL*
naturally
of
a
confiding
disposition
,
but
slavery
had
made
me
suspicious
of
*NL*
every
body
.
Fanny
did
not
share
my
distrust
of
the
captain
or
his
men
.
She
*NL*
said
she
was
afraid
at
first
,
but
she
had
been
on
board
three
days
while
*NL*
the
vessel
lay
in
the
dock
,
and
nobody
had
betrayed
her
,
or
treated
her
*NL*
otherwise
than
kindly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
soon
came
to
advise
us
to
go
on
deck
for
fresh
air
.
His
*NL*
friendly
and
respectful
manner
,
combined
with
Fanny
's
testimony
,
reassured
*NL*
me
,
and
we
went
with
him
.
He
placed
us
in
a
comfortable
seat
,
and
*NL*
occasionally
entered
into
conversation
.
He
told
us
he
was
a
Southerner
by
*NL*
birth
,
and
had
spent
the
greater
part
of
his
life
in
the
Slave
States
,
and
*NL*
that
he
had
recently
lost
a
brother
who
traded
in
slaves
.
``
But
,
''
said
he
,
*NL*
``
it
is
a
pitiable
and
degrading
business
,
and
I
always
felt
ashamed
to
*NL*
acknowledge
my
brother
in
connection
with
it
.
''
As
we
passed
Snaky
Swamp
,
he
*NL*
pointed
to
it
,
and
said
,
``
There
is
a
slave
territory
that
defies
all
the
*NL*
laws
.
''
I
thought
of
the
terrible
days
I
had
spent
there
,
and
though
it
was
*NL*
not
called
Dismal
Swamp
,
it
made
me
feel
very
dismal
as
I
looked
at
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
shall
never
forget
that
night
.
The
balmy
air
of
spring
was
so
refreshing
!
*NL*
And
how
shall
I
describe
my
sensations
when
we
were
fairly
sailing
on
*NL*
Chesapeake
Bay
?
O
,
the
beautiful
sunshine
!
the
exhilarating
breeze
!
And
I
*NL*
could
enjoy
them
without
fear
or
restraint
.
I
had
never
realized
what
grand
*NL*
things
air
and
sunlight
are
till
I
had
been
deprived
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ten
days
after
we
left
land
we
were
approaching
Philadelphia
.
The
captain
*NL*
said
we
should
arrive
there
in
the
night
,
but
he
thought
we
had
better
wait
*NL*
till
morning
,
and
go
on
shore
in
broad
daylight
,
as
the
best
way
to
avoid
*NL*
suspicion
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
replied
,
``
You
know
best
.
But
will
you
stay
on
board
and
protect
us
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
saw
that
I
was
suspicious
,
and
he
said
he
was
sorry
,
now
that
he
had
*NL*
brought
us
to
the
end
of
our
voyage
,
to
find
I
had
so
little
confidence
in
*NL*
him
.
Ah
,
if
he
had
ever
been
a
slave
he
would
have
known
how
difficult
it
*NL*
was
to
trust
a
white
man
.
He
assured
us
that
we
might
sleep
through
the
*NL*
night
without
fear
;
that
he
would
take
care
we
were
not
left
unprotected
.
*NL*
Be
it
said
to
the
honor
of
this
captain
,
Southerner
as
he
was
,
that
if
*NL*
Fanny
and
I
had
been
white
ladies
,
and
our
passage
lawfully
engaged
,
he
*NL*
could
not
have
treated
us
more
respectfully
.
My
intelligent
friend
,
Peter
,
*NL*
had
rightly
estimated
the
character
of
the
man
to
whose
honor
he
had
*NL*
intrusted
us
.
The
next
morning
I
was
on
deck
as
soon
as
the
day
dawned
.
I
*NL*
called
Fanny
to
see
the
sun
rise
,
for
the
first
time
in
our
lives
,
on
free
*NL*
soil
;
for
such
I
_
then
_
believed
it
to
be
.
We
watched
the
reddening
sky
,
*NL*
and
saw
the
great
orb
come
up
slowly
out
of
the
water
,
as
it
seemed
.
Soon
*NL*
the
waves
began
to
sparkle
,
and
every
thing
caught
the
beautiful
glow
.
*NL*
Before
us
lay
the
city
of
strangers
.
We
looked
at
each
other
,
and
the
eyes
*NL*
of
both
were
moistened
with
tears
.
We
had
escaped
from
slavery
,
and
we
*NL*
supposed
ourselves
to
be
safe
from
the
hunters
.
But
we
were
alone
in
the
*NL*
world
,
and
we
had
left
dear
ties
behind
us
;
ties
cruelly
sundered
by
the
*NL*
demon
Slavery
.

Incidents
In
Philadelphia
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
heard
that
the
poor
slave
had
many
friends
at
the
north
.
I
trusted
we
*NL*
should
find
some
of
them
.
Meantime
,
we
would
take
it
for
granted
that
all
*NL*
were
friends
,
till
they
proved
to
the
contrary
.
I
sought
out
the
kind
*NL*
captain
,
thanked
him
for
his
attentions
,
and
told
him
I
should
never
cease
*NL*
to
be
grateful
for
the
service
he
had
rendered
us
.
I
gave
him
a
message
to
*NL*
the
friends
I
had
left
at
home
,
and
he
promised
to
deliver
it
.
We
were
*NL*
placed
in
a
row-boat
,
and
in
about
fifteen
minutes
were
landed
on
a
wood
*NL*
wharf
in
Philadelphia
.
As
I
stood
looking
round
,
the
friendly
captain
*NL*
touched
me
on
the
shoulder
,
and
said
,
``
There
is
a
respectable-looking
*NL*
colored
man
behind
you
.
I
will
speak
to
him
about
the
New
York
trains
,
and
*NL*
tell
him
you
wish
to
go
directly
on
.
''
I
thanked
him
,
and
asked
him
to
*NL*
direct
me
to
some
shops
where
I
could
buy
gloves
and
veils
.
He
did
so
,
and
*NL*
said
he
would
talk
with
the
colored
man
till
I
returned
.
I
made
what
haste
*NL*
I
could
.
Constant
exercise
on
board
the
vessel
,
and
frequent
rubbing
with
*NL*
salt
water
,
had
nearly
restored
the
use
of
my
limbs
.
The
noise
of
the
great
*NL*
city
confused
me
,
but
I
found
the
shops
,
and
bought
some
double
veils
and
*NL*
gloves
for
Fanny
and
myself
.
The
shopman
told
me
they
were
so
many
levies
.
*NL*
I
had
never
heard
the
word
before
,
but
I
did
not
tell
him
so
.
I
thought
if
*NL*
he
knew
I
was
a
stranger
he
might
ask
me
where
I
came
from
.
I
gave
him
a
*NL*
gold
piece
,
and
when
he
returned
the
change
,
I
counted
it
,
and
found
out
*NL*
how
much
a
levy
was
.
I
made
my
way
back
to
the
wharf
,
where
the
captain
*NL*
introduced
me
to
the
colored
man
,
as
the
Rev.
Jeremiah
Durham
,
minister
of
*NL*
Bethel
church
.
He
took
me
by
the
hand
,
as
if
I
had
been
an
old
friend
.
He
*NL*
told
us
we
were
too
late
for
the
morning
cars
to
New
York
,
and
must
wait
*NL*
until
the
evening
,
or
the
next
morning
.
He
invited
me
to
go
home
with
him
,
*NL*
assuring
me
that
his
wife
would
give
me
a
cordial
welcome
;
and
for
my
*NL*
friend
he
would
provide
a
home
with
one
of
his
neighbors
.
I
thanked
him
for
*NL*
so
much
kindness
to
strangers
,
and
told
him
if
I
must
be
detained
,
I
should
*NL*
like
to
hunt
up
some
people
who
formerly
went
from
our
part
of
the
country
.
*NL*
Mr.
Durham
insisted
that
I
should
dine
with
him
,
and
then
he
would
assist
*NL*
me
in
finding
my
friends
.
The
sailors
came
to
bid
us
good
by
.
I
shook
their
*NL*
hardy
hands
,
with
tears
in
my
eyes
.
They
had
all
been
kind
to
us
,
and
they
*NL*
had
rendered
us
a
greater
service
than
they
could
possibly
conceive
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
never
seen
so
large
a
city
,
or
been
in
contact
with
so
many
people
in
*NL*
the
streets
.
It
seemed
as
if
those
who
passed
looked
at
us
with
an
*NL*
expression
of
curiosity
.
My
face
was
so
blistered
and
peeled
,
by
sitting
on
*NL*
deck
,
in
wind
and
sunshine
,
that
I
thought
they
could
not
easily
decide
to
*NL*
what
nation
I
belonged
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Durham
met
me
with
a
kindly
welcome
,
without
asking
any
questions
.
I
*NL*
was
tired
,
and
her
friendly
manner
was
a
sweet
refreshment
.
God
bless
her
!
*NL*
I
was
sure
that
she
had
comforted
other
weary
hearts
,
before
I
received
her
*NL*
sympathy
.
She
was
surrounded
by
her
husband
and
children
,
in
a
home
made
*NL*
sacred
by
protecting
laws
.
I
thought
of
my
own
children
,
and
sighed
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
dinner
Mr.
Durham
went
with
me
in
quest
of
the
friends
I
had
spoken
*NL*
of
.
They
went
from
my
native
town
,
and
I
anticipated
much
pleasure
in
*NL*
looking
on
familiar
faces
.
They
were
not
at
home
,
and
we
retracted
our
*NL*
steps
through
streets
delightfully
clean
.
On
the
way
,
Mr.
Durham
observed
*NL*
that
I
had
spoken
to
him
of
a
daughter
I
expected
to
meet
;
that
he
was
*NL*
surprised
,
for
I
looked
so
young
he
had
taken
me
for
a
single
woman
.
He
was
*NL*
approaching
a
subject
on
which
I
was
extremely
sensitive
.
He
would
ask
*NL*
about
my
husband
next
,
I
thought
,
and
if
I
answered
him
truly
,
what
would
*NL*
he
think
of
me
?
I
told
him
I
had
two
children
,
one
in
New
York
the
other
at
*NL*
the
south
.
He
asked
some
further
questions
,
and
I
frankly
told
him
some
of
*NL*
the
most
important
events
of
my
life
.
It
was
painful
for
me
to
do
it
;
but
I
*NL*
would
not
deceive
him
.
If
he
was
desirous
of
being
my
friend
,
I
thought
he
*NL*
ought
to
know
how
far
I
was
worthy
of
it
.
``
Excuse
me
,
if
I
have
tried
your
*NL*
feelings
,
''
said
he
.
``
I
did
not
question
you
from
idle
curiosity
.
I
wanted
*NL*
to
understand
your
situation
,
in
order
to
know
whether
I
could
be
of
any
*NL*
service
to
you
,
or
your
little
girl
.
Your
straight-forward
answers
do
you
*NL*
credit
;
but
do
n't
answer
every
body
so
openly
.
It
might
give
some
heartless
*NL*
people
a
pretext
for
treating
you
with
contempt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
word
_
contempt
_
burned
me
like
coals
of
fire
.
I
replied
,
``
God
alone
*NL*
knows
how
I
have
suffered
;
and
He
,
I
trust
,
will
forgive
me
.
If
I
am
*NL*
permitted
to
have
my
children
,
I
intend
to
be
a
good
mother
,
and
to
live
in
*NL*
such
a
manner
that
people
can
not
treat
me
with
contempt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
respect
your
sentiments
,
''
said
he
.
``
Place
your
trust
in
God
,
and
be
*NL*
governed
by
good
principles
,
and
you
will
not
fail
to
find
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
reached
home
,
I
went
to
my
room
,
glad
to
shut
out
the
world
for
a
*NL*
while
.
The
words
he
had
spoken
made
an
indelible
impression
upon
me
.
They
*NL*
brought
up
great
shadows
from
the
mournful
past
.
In
the
midst
of
my
*NL*
meditations
I
was
startled
by
a
knock
at
the
door
.
Mrs.
Durham
entered
,
her
*NL*
face
all
beaming
with
kindness
,
to
say
that
there
was
an
anti-slavery
*NL*
friend
down
stairs
,
who
would
like
to
see
me
.
I
overcame
my
dread
of
*NL*
encountering
strangers
,
and
went
with
her
.
Many
questions
were
asked
*NL*
concerning
my
experiences
,
and
my
escape
from
slavery
;
but
I
observed
how
*NL*
careful
they
all
were
not
to
say
any
thing
that
might
wound
my
feelings
.
*NL*
How
gratifying
this
was
,
can
be
fully
understood
only
by
those
who
have
*NL*
been
accustomed
to
be
treated
as
if
they
were
not
included
within
the
pale
*NL*
of
human
beings
.
The
anti-slavery
friend
had
come
to
inquire
into
my
plans
,
*NL*
and
to
offer
assistance
,
if
needed
.
Fanny
was
comfortably
established
,
for
*NL*
the
present
,
with
a
friend
of
Mr.
Durham
.
The
Anti-Slavery
Society
agreed
*NL*
to
pay
her
expenses
to
New
York
.
The
same
was
offered
to
me
,
but
I
declined
*NL*
to
accept
it
,
telling
them
that
my
grandmother
had
given
me
sufficient
to
*NL*
pay
my
expenses
to
the
end
of
my
journey
.
We
were
urged
to
remain
in
*NL*
Philadelphia
a
few
days
,
until
some
suitable
escort
could
be
found
for
us
.
*NL*
I
gladly
accepted
the
proposition
,
for
I
had
a
dread
of
meeting
*NL*
slaveholders
,
and
some
dread
also
of
railroads
.
I
had
never
entered
a
*NL*
railroad
car
in
my
life
,
and
it
seemed
to
me
quite
an
important
event
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
night
I
sought
my
pillow
with
feelings
I
had
never
carried
to
it
*NL*
before
.
I
verily
believed
myself
to
be
a
free
woman
.
I
was
wakeful
for
a
*NL*
long
time
,
and
I
had
no
sooner
fallen
asleep
,
than
I
was
roused
by
*NL*
fire-bells
.
I
jumped
up
,
and
hurried
on
my
clothes
.
Where
I
came
from
,
*NL*
every
body
hastened
to
dress
themselves
on
such
occasions
.
The
white
people
*NL*
thought
a
great
fire
might
be
used
as
a
good
opportunity
for
insurrection
,
*NL*
and
that
it
was
best
to
be
in
readiness
;
and
the
colored
people
were
*NL*
ordered
out
to
labor
in
extinguishing
the
flames
.
There
was
but
one
engine
*NL*
in
our
town
,
and
colored
women
and
children
were
often
required
to
drag
it
*NL*
to
the
river
's
edge
and
fill
it
.
Mrs.
Durham
's
daughter
slept
in
the
same
*NL*
room
with
me
,
and
seeing
that
she
slept
through
all
the
din
,
I
thought
it
*NL*
was
my
duty
to
wake
her
.
``
What
's
the
matter
?
''
said
she
,
rubbing
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
screaming
fire
in
the
streets
,
and
the
bells
are
ringing
,
''
I
*NL*
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
of
that
?
''
said
she
,
drowsily
.
``
We
are
used
to
it
.
We
never
get
up
,
*NL*
without
the
fire
is
very
near
.
What
good
would
it
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
quite
surprised
that
it
was
not
necessary
for
us
to
go
and
help
fill
*NL*
the
engine
.
I
was
an
ignorant
child
,
just
beginning
to
learn
how
things
*NL*
went
on
in
great
cities
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
daylight
,
I
heard
women
crying
fresh
fish
,
berries
,
radishes
,
and
*NL*
various
other
things
.
All
this
was
new
to
me
.
I
dressed
myself
at
an
early
*NL*
hour
,
and
sat
at
the
window
to
watch
that
unknown
tide
of
life
.
*NL*
Philadelphia
seemed
to
me
a
wonderfully
great
place
.
At
the
breakfast
*NL*
table
,
my
idea
of
going
out
to
drag
the
engine
was
laughed
over
,
and
I
*NL*
joined
in
the
mirth
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
to
see
Fanny
,
and
found
her
so
well
contented
among
her
new
friends
*NL*
that
she
was
in
no
haste
to
leave
.
I
was
also
very
happy
with
my
kind
*NL*
hostess
.
She
had
had
advantages
for
education
,
and
was
vastly
my
superior
.
*NL*
Every
day
,
almost
every
hour
,
I
was
adding
to
my
little
stock
of
knowledge
.
*NL*
She
took
me
out
to
see
the
city
as
much
as
she
deemed
prudent
.
One
day
she
*NL*
took
me
to
an
artist
's
room
,
and
showed
me
the
portraits
of
some
of
her
*NL*
children
.
I
had
never
seen
any
paintings
of
colored
people
before
,
and
they
*NL*
seemed
to
be
beautiful
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
end
of
five
days
,
one
of
Mrs.
Durham
's
friends
offered
to
accompany
*NL*
us
to
New
York
the
following
morning
.
As
I
held
the
hand
of
my
good
hostess
*NL*
in
a
parting
clasp
,
I
longed
to
know
whether
her
husband
had
repeated
to
*NL*
her
what
I
had
told
him
.
I
supposed
he
had
,
but
she
never
made
any
allusion
*NL*
to
it
.
I
presume
it
was
the
delicate
silence
of
womanly
sympathy
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Mr.
Durham
handed
us
our
tickets
,
he
said
,
``
I
am
afraid
you
will
have
*NL*
a
disagreeable
ride
;
but
I
could
not
procure
tickets
for
the
first-class
*NL*
cars
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Supposing
I
had
not
given
him
money
enough
,
I
offered
more
.
``
O
,
no
,
''
said
*NL*
he
,
``
they
could
not
be
had
for
any
money
.
They
do
n't
allow
colored
people
*NL*
to
go
in
the
first-class
cars
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
first
chill
to
my
enthusiasm
about
the
Free
States
.
Colored
*NL*
people
were
allowed
to
ride
in
a
filthy
box
,
behind
white
people
,
at
the
*NL*
south
,
but
there
they
were
not
required
to
pay
for
the
privilege
.
It
made
*NL*
me
sad
to
find
how
the
north
aped
the
customs
of
slavery
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
stowed
away
in
a
large
,
rough
car
,
with
windows
on
each
side
,
too
*NL*
high
for
us
to
look
out
without
standing
up
.
It
was
crowded
with
people
,
*NL*
apparently
of
all
nations
.
There
were
plenty
of
beds
and
cradles
,
*NL*
containing
screaming
and
kicking
babies
.
Every
other
man
had
a
cigar
or
*NL*
pipe
in
his
mouth
,
and
jugs
of
whiskey
were
handed
round
freely
.
The
fumes
*NL*
of
the
whiskey
and
the
dense
tobacco
smoke
were
sickening
to
my
senses
,
and
*NL*
my
mind
was
equally
nauseated
by
the
coarse
jokes
and
ribald
songs
around
*NL*
me
.
It
was
a
very
disagreeable
ride
.
Since
that
time
there
has
been
some
*NL*
improvement
in
these
matters
.
*NL*

XXXII
.
The
Meeting
Of
Mother
And
Daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
arrived
in
New
York
,
I
was
half
crazed
by
the
crowd
of
coachmen
*NL*
calling
out
,
``
Carriage
,
ma'am
?
''
We
bargained
with
one
to
take
us
to
*NL*
Sullivan
Street
for
twelve
shillings
.
A
burly
Irishman
stepped
up
and
said
,
*NL*
``
I
'll
tak
'
ye
for
sax
shillings
.
''
The
reduction
of
half
the
price
was
an
*NL*
object
to
us
,
and
we
asked
if
he
could
take
us
right
away
.
``
Troth
an
I
*NL*
will
,
ladies
,
''
he
replied
.
I
noticed
that
the
hackmen
smiled
at
each
other
,
*NL*
and
I
inquired
whether
his
conveyance
was
decent
.
``
Yes
,
it
's
dacent
it
is
,
*NL*
marm
.
Devil
a
bit
would
I
be
after
takin
'
ladies
in
a
cab
that
was
not
*NL*
dacent
.
''
We
gave
him
our
checks
.
He
went
for
the
baggage
,
and
soon
*NL*
reappeared
,
saying
,
``
This
way
,
if
you
plase
,
ladies
.
''
We
followed
,
and
*NL*
found
our
trunks
on
a
truck
,
and
we
were
invited
to
take
our
seats
on
them
.
*NL*
We
told
him
that
was
not
what
we
bargained
for
,
and
he
must
take
the
trunks
*NL*
off
.
He
swore
they
should
not
be
touched
till
we
had
paid
him
six
*NL*
shillings
.
In
our
situation
it
was
not
prudent
to
attract
attention
,
and
I
*NL*
was
about
to
pay
him
what
he
required
,
when
a
man
near
by
shook
his
head
*NL*
for
me
not
to
do
it
.
After
a
great
ado
we
got
rid
of
the
Irishman
,
and
had
*NL*
our
trunks
fastened
on
a
hack
.
We
had
been
recommended
to
a
boarding-house
*NL*
in
Sullivan
Street
,
and
thither
we
drove
.
There
Fanny
and
I
separated
.
The
*NL*
Anti-Slavery
Society
provided
a
home
for
her
,
and
I
afterwards
heard
of
her
*NL*
in
prosperous
circumstances
.
I
sent
for
an
old
friend
from
my
part
of
the
*NL*
country
,
who
had
for
some
time
been
doing
business
in
New
York
.
He
came
*NL*
immediately
.
I
told
him
I
wanted
to
go
to
my
daughter
,
and
asked
him
to
aid
*NL*
me
in
procuring
an
interview
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
cautioned
him
not
to
let
it
be
known
to
the
family
that
I
had
just
*NL*
arrived
from
the
south
,
because
they
supposed
I
had
been
at
the
north
seven
*NL*
years
.
He
told
me
there
was
a
colored
woman
in
Brooklyn
who
came
from
the
*NL*
same
town
I
did
,
and
I
had
better
go
to
her
house
,
and
have
my
daughter
*NL*
meet
me
there
.
I
accepted
the
proposition
thankfully
,
and
he
agreed
to
*NL*
escort
me
to
Brooklyn
.
We
crossed
Fulton
ferry
,
went
up
Myrtle
Avenue
,
and
*NL*
stopped
at
the
house
he
designated
.
I
was
just
about
to
enter
,
when
two
*NL*
girls
passed
.
My
friend
called
my
attention
to
them
.
I
turned
,
and
*NL*
recognized
in
the
eldest
,
Sarah
,
the
daughter
of
a
woman
who
used
to
live
*NL*
with
my
grandmother
,
but
who
had
left
the
south
years
ago
.
Surprised
and
*NL*
rejoiced
at
this
unexpected
meeting
,
I
threw
my
arms
round
her
,
and
*NL*
inquired
concerning
her
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
take
no
notice
of
the
other
girl
,
''
said
my
friend
.
I
turned
,
and
there
*NL*
stood
my
Ellen
!
I
pressed
her
to
my
heart
,
then
held
her
away
from
me
to
*NL*
take
a
look
at
her
.
She
had
changed
a
good
deal
in
the
two
years
since
I
*NL*
parted
from
her
.
Signs
of
neglect
could
be
discerned
by
eyes
less
observing
*NL*
than
a
mother
's
.
My
friend
invited
us
all
to
go
into
the
house
;
but
Ellen
*NL*
said
she
had
been
sent
of
an
errand
,
which
she
would
do
as
quickly
as
*NL*
possible
,
and
go
home
and
ask
Mrs.
Hobbs
to
let
her
come
and
see
me
.
It
was
*NL*
agreed
that
I
should
send
for
her
the
next
day
.
Her
companion
,
Sarah
,
*NL*
hastened
to
tell
her
mother
of
my
arrival
.
When
I
entered
the
house
,
I
*NL*
found
the
mistress
of
it
absent
,
and
I
waited
for
her
return
.
Before
I
saw
*NL*
her
,
I
heard
her
saying
,
``
Where
is
Linda
Brent
?
I
used
to
know
her
father
*NL*
and
mother
.
''
Soon
Sarah
came
with
her
mother
.
So
there
was
quite
a
company
*NL*
of
us
,
all
from
my
grandmother
's
neighborhood
.
These
friends
gathered
round
*NL*
me
and
questioned
me
eagerly
.
They
laughed
,
they
cried
,
and
they
shouted
.
*NL*
They
thanked
God
that
I
had
got
away
from
my
persecutors
and
was
safe
on
*NL*
Long
Island
.
It
was
a
day
of
great
excitement
.
How
different
from
the
*NL*
silent
days
I
had
passed
in
my
dreary
den
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
was
Sunday
.
My
first
waking
thoughts
were
occupied
with
*NL*
the
note
I
was
to
send
to
Mrs.
Hobbs
,
the
lady
with
whom
Ellen
lived
.
That
*NL*
I
had
recently
come
into
that
vicinity
was
evident
;
otherwise
I
should
have
*NL*
sooner
inquired
for
my
daughter
.
It
would
not
do
to
let
them
know
I
had
*NL*
just
arrived
from
the
south
,
for
that
would
involve
the
suspicion
of
my
*NL*
having
been
harbored
there
,
and
might
bring
trouble
,
if
not
ruin
,
on
*NL*
several
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
like
a
straightforward
course
,
and
am
always
reluctant
to
resort
to
*NL*
subterfuges
.
So
far
as
my
ways
have
been
crooked
,
I
charge
them
all
upon
*NL*
slavery
.
It
was
that
system
of
violence
and
wrong
which
now
left
me
no
*NL*
alternative
but
to
enact
a
falsehood
.
I
began
my
note
by
stating
that
I
had
*NL*
recently
arrived
from
Canada
,
and
was
very
desirous
to
have
my
daughter
*NL*
come
to
see
me
.
She
came
and
brought
a
message
from
Mrs.
Hobbs
,
inviting
me
*NL*
to
her
house
,
and
assuring
me
that
I
need
not
have
any
fears
.
The
*NL*
conversation
I
had
with
my
child
did
not
leave
my
mind
at
ease
.
When
I
*NL*
asked
if
she
was
well
treated
,
she
answered
yes
;
but
there
was
no
*NL*
heartiness
in
the
tone
,
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
she
said
it
from
an
*NL*
unwillingness
to
have
me
troubled
on
her
account
.
Before
she
left
me
,
she
*NL*
asked
very
earnestly
,
``
Mother
,
will
you
take
me
to
live
with
you
?
''
It
made
*NL*
me
sad
to
think
that
I
could
not
give
her
a
home
till
I
went
to
work
and
*NL*
earned
the
means
;
and
that
might
take
me
a
long
time
.
When
she
was
placed
*NL*
with
Mrs.
Hobbs
,
the
agreement
was
that
she
should
be
sent
to
school
She
*NL*
had
been
there
two
years
,
and
was
now
nine
years
old
,
and
she
scarcely
knew
*NL*
her
letters
.
There
was
no
excuse
for
this
,
for
there
were
good
public
*NL*
schools
in
Brooklyn
,
to
which
she
could
have
been
sent
without
expense
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
staid
with
me
till
dark
,
and
I
went
home
with
her
.
I
was
received
in
a
*NL*
friendly
manner
by
the
family
,
and
all
agreed
in
saying
that
Ellen
was
a
*NL*
useful
,
good
girl
.
Mrs.
Hobbs
looked
me
coolly
in
the
face
,
and
said
,
``
I
*NL*
suppose
you
know
that
my
cousin
,
Mr.
Sands
,
has
_
given
_
her
to
my
eldest
*NL*
daughter
.
She
will
make
a
nice
waiting-maid
for
her
when
she
grows
up
.
''
I
*NL*
did
not
answer
a
word
.
How
_
could
_
she
,
who
knew
by
experience
the
strength
*NL*
of
a
mother
's
love
,
and
who
was
perfectly
aware
of
the
relation
Mr.
Sands
*NL*
bore
to
my
children
,
--
how
_
could
_
she
look
me
in
the
face
,
while
she
thrust
*NL*
such
a
dagger
into
my
heart
?
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
no
longer
surprised
that
they
had
kept
her
in
such
a
state
of
*NL*
ignorance
.
Mr.
Hobbs
had
formerly
been
wealthy
,
but
he
had
failed
,
and
*NL*
afterwards
obtained
a
subordinate
situation
in
the
Custom
House
.
Perhaps
*NL*
they
expected
to
return
to
the
south
some
day
;
and
Ellen
's
knowledge
was
*NL*
quite
sufficient
for
a
slave
's
condition
.
I
was
impatient
to
go
to
work
and
*NL*
earn
money
,
that
I
might
change
the
uncertain
position
of
my
children
.
Mr.
*NL*
Sands
had
not
kept
his
promise
to
emancipate
them
.
I
had
also
been
deceived
*NL*
about
Ellen
.
What
security
had
I
with
regard
to
Benjamin
?
I
felt
that
I
had
*NL*
none
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
returned
to
my
friend
's
house
in
an
uneasy
state
of
mind
.
In
order
to
*NL*
protect
my
children
,
it
was
necessary
that
I
should
own
myself
.
I
called
*NL*
myself
free
,
and
sometimes
felt
so
;
but
I
knew
I
was
insecure
.
I
sat
down
*NL*
that
night
and
wrote
a
civil
letter
to
Dr.
Flint
,
asking
him
to
state
the
*NL*
lowest
terms
on
which
he
would
sell
me
;
and
as
I
belonged
by
law
to
his
*NL*
daughter
,
I
wrote
to
her
also
,
making
a
similar
request
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
my
arrival
at
the
north
I
had
not
been
unmindful
of
my
dear
brother
*NL*
William
.
I
had
made
diligent
inquiries
for
him
,
and
having
heard
of
him
in
*NL*
Boston
,
I
went
thither
.
When
I
arrived
there
,
I
found
he
had
gone
to
New
*NL*
Bedford
.
I
wrote
to
that
place
,
and
was
informed
he
had
gone
on
a
whaling
*NL*
voyage
,
and
would
not
return
for
some
months
.
I
went
back
to
New
York
to
*NL*
get
employment
near
Ellen
.
I
received
an
answer
from
Dr.
Flint
,
which
gave
*NL*
me
no
encouragement
.
He
advised
me
to
return
and
submit
myself
to
my
*NL*
rightful
owners
,
and
then
any
request
I
might
make
would
be
granted
.
I
lent
*NL*
this
letter
to
a
friend
,
who
lost
it
;
otherwise
I
would
present
a
copy
to
*NL*
my
readers
.

XXXIII
.
A
Home
Found
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
My
greatest
anxiety
now
was
to
obtain
employment
.
My
health
was
greatly
*NL*
improved
,
though
my
limbs
continued
to
trouble
me
with
swelling
whenever
I
*NL*
walked
much
.
The
greatest
difficulty
in
my
way
was
,
that
those
who
employed
*NL*
strangers
required
a
recommendation
;
and
in
my
peculiar
position
,
I
could
,
*NL*
of
course
,
obtain
no
certificates
from
the
families
I
had
so
faithfully
*NL*
served
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
an
acquaintance
told
me
of
a
lady
who
wanted
a
nurse
for
her
babe
,
*NL*
and
I
immediately
applied
for
the
situation
.
The
lady
told
me
she
preferred
*NL*
to
have
one
who
had
been
a
mother
,
and
accustomed
to
the
care
of
infants
.
I
*NL*
told
her
I
had
nursed
two
babes
of
my
own
.
She
asked
me
many
questions
,
*NL*
but
,
to
my
great
relief
,
did
not
require
a
recommendation
from
my
former
*NL*
employers
.
She
told
me
she
was
an
English
woman
,
and
that
was
a
pleasant
*NL*
circumstance
to
me
,
because
I
had
heard
they
had
less
prejudice
against
*NL*
color
than
Americans
entertained
.
It
was
agreed
that
we
should
try
each
*NL*
other
for
a
week
.
The
trial
proved
satisfactory
to
both
parties
,
and
I
was
*NL*
engaged
for
a
month
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
heavenly
Father
had
been
most
merciful
to
me
in
leading
me
to
this
*NL*
place
.
Mrs.
Bruce
was
a
kind
and
gentle
lady
,
and
proved
a
true
and
*NL*
sympathizing
friend
.
Before
the
stipulated
month
expired
,
the
necessity
of
*NL*
passing
up
and
down
stairs
frequently
,
caused
my
limbs
to
swell
so
*NL*
painfully
,
that
I
became
unable
to
perform
my
duties
.
Many
ladies
would
*NL*
have
thoughtlessly
discharged
me
;
but
Mrs.
Bruce
made
arrangements
to
save
*NL*
me
steps
,
and
employed
a
physician
to
attend
upon
me
.
I
had
not
yet
told
*NL*
her
that
I
was
a
fugitive
slave
.
She
noticed
that
I
was
often
sad
,
and
*NL*
kindly
inquired
the
cause
.
I
spoke
of
being
separated
from
my
children
,
and
*NL*
from
relatives
who
were
dear
to
me
;
but
I
did
not
mention
the
constant
*NL*
feeling
of
insecurity
which
oppressed
my
spirits
.
I
longed
for
some
one
to
*NL*
confide
it
;
but
I
had
been
so
deceived
by
white
people
,
that
I
had
lost
all
*NL*
confidence
in
them
.
If
they
spoke
kind
words
to
me
,
I
thought
it
was
for
*NL*
some
selfish
purpose
.
I
had
entered
this
family
with
the
distrustful
*NL*
feelings
I
had
brought
with
me
out
of
slavery
;
but
ere
six
months
had
*NL*
passed
,
I
found
that
the
gentle
deportment
of
Mrs.
Bruce
and
the
smiles
of
*NL*
her
lovely
babe
were
thawing
my
chilled
heart
.
My
narrow
mind
also
began
to
*NL*
expand
under
the
influences
of
her
intelligent
conversation
,
and
the
*NL*
opportunities
for
reading
,
which
were
gladly
allowed
me
whenever
I
had
*NL*
leisure
from
my
duties
.
I
gradually
became
more
energetic
and
more
*NL*
cheerful
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
feeling
of
insecurity
,
especially
with
regard
to
my
children
,
often
*NL*
threw
its
dark
shadow
across
my
sunshine
.
Mrs.
Bruce
offered
me
a
home
for
*NL*
Ellen
;
but
pleasant
as
it
would
have
been
,
I
did
not
dare
to
accept
it
,
for
*NL*
fear
of
offending
the
Hobbs
family
.
Their
knowledge
of
my
precarious
*NL*
situation
placed
me
in
their
power
;
and
I
felt
that
it
was
important
for
me
*NL*
to
keep
on
the
right
side
of
them
,
till
,
by
dint
of
labor
and
economy
,
I
*NL*
could
make
a
home
for
my
children
.
I
was
far
from
feeling
satisfied
with
*NL*
Ellen
's
situation
.
She
was
not
well
cared
for
.
She
sometimes
came
to
New
*NL*
York
to
visit
me
;
but
she
generally
brought
a
request
from
Mrs.
Hobbs
that
*NL*
I
would
buy
her
a
pair
of
shoes
,
or
some
article
of
clothing
.
This
was
*NL*
accompanied
by
a
promise
of
payment
when
Mr.
Hobbs
's
salary
at
the
Custom
*NL*
House
became
due
;
but
some
how
or
other
the
pay-day
never
came
.
Thus
many
*NL*
dollars
of
my
earnings
were
expended
to
keep
my
child
comfortably
clothed
.
*NL*
That
,
however
,
was
a
slight
trouble
,
compared
with
the
fear
that
their
*NL*
pecuniary
embarrassments
might
induce
them
to
sell
my
precious
young
*NL*
daughter
.
I
knew
they
were
in
constant
communication
with
Southerners
,
and
*NL*
had
frequent
opportunities
to
do
it
.
I
have
stated
that
when
Dr.
Flint
put
*NL*
Ellen
in
jail
,
at
two
years
old
,
she
had
an
inflammation
of
the
eyes
,
*NL*
occasioned
by
measles
.
This
disease
still
troubled
her
;
and
kind
Mrs.
Bruce
*NL*
proposed
that
she
should
come
to
New
York
for
a
while
,
to
be
under
the
care
*NL*
of
Dr.
Elliott
,
a
well
known
oculist
.
It
did
not
occur
to
me
that
there
was
*NL*
any
thing
improper
in
a
mother
's
making
such
a
request
;
but
Mrs.
Hobbs
was
*NL*
very
angry
,
and
refused
to
let
her
go
.
Situated
as
I
was
,
it
was
not
*NL*
politic
to
insist
upon
it
.
I
made
no
complaint
,
but
I
longed
to
be
entirely
*NL*
free
to
act
a
mother
's
part
towards
my
children
.
The
next
time
I
went
over
*NL*
to
Brooklyn
,
Mrs.
Hobbs
,
as
if
to
apologize
for
her
anger
,
told
me
she
had
*NL*
employed
her
own
physician
to
attend
to
Ellen
's
eyes
,
and
that
she
had
*NL*
refused
my
request
because
she
did
not
consider
it
safe
to
trust
her
in
New
*NL*
York
.
I
accepted
the
explanation
in
silence
;
but
she
had
told
me
that
my
*NL*
child
_
belonged
_
to
her
daughter
,
and
I
suspected
that
her
real
motive
was
*NL*
a
fear
of
my
conveying
her
property
away
from
her
.
Perhaps
I
did
her
*NL*
injustice
;
but
my
knowledge
of
Southerners
made
it
difficult
for
me
to
feel
*NL*
otherwise
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sweet
and
bitter
were
mixed
in
the
cup
of
my
life
,
and
I
was
thankful
that
*NL*
it
had
ceased
to
be
entirely
bitter
.
I
loved
Mrs.
Bruce
's
babe
.
When
it
*NL*
laughed
and
crowed
in
my
face
,
and
twined
its
little
tender
arms
*NL*
confidingly
about
my
neck
,
it
made
me
think
of
the
time
when
Benny
and
*NL*
Ellen
were
babies
,
and
my
wounded
heart
was
soothed
.
One
bright
morning
,
as
*NL*
I
stood
at
the
window
,
tossing
baby
in
my
arms
,
my
attention
was
attracted
*NL*
by
a
young
man
in
sailor
's
dress
,
who
was
closely
observing
every
house
as
*NL*
he
passed
.
I
looked
at
him
earnestly
.
Could
it
be
my
brother
William
?
It
*NL*
_
must
_
be
he
--
and
yet
,
how
changed
!
I
placed
the
baby
safely
,
flew
down
*NL*
stairs
,
opened
the
front
door
,
beckoned
to
the
sailor
,
and
in
less
than
a
*NL*
minute
I
was
clasped
in
my
brother
's
arms
.
How
much
we
had
to
tell
each
*NL*
other
!
How
we
laughed
,
and
how
we
cried
,
over
each
other
's
adventures
!
I
*NL*
took
him
to
Brooklyn
,
and
again
saw
him
with
Ellen
,
the
dear
child
whom
he
*NL*
had
loved
and
tended
so
carefully
,
while
I
was
shut
up
in
my
miserable
den
.
*NL*
He
staid
in
New
York
a
week
.
His
old
feelings
of
affection
for
me
and
Ellen
*NL*
were
as
lively
as
ever
.
There
are
no
bonds
so
strong
as
those
which
are
*NL*
formed
by
suffering
together
.

The
Old
Enemy
Again
.

*NL*
*NL*
My
young
mistress
,
Miss
Emily
Flint
,
did
not
return
any
answer
to
my
letter
*NL*
requesting
her
to
consent
to
my
being
sold
.
But
after
a
while
,
I
received
a
*NL*
reply
,
which
purported
to
be
written
by
her
younger
brother
.
In
order
*NL*
rightly
to
enjoy
the
contents
of
this
letter
,
the
reader
must
bear
in
mind
*NL*
that
the
Flint
family
supposed
I
had
been
at
the
north
many
years
.
They
had
*NL*
no
idea
that
I
knew
of
the
doctor
's
three
excursions
to
New
York
in
search
*NL*
of
me
;
that
I
had
heard
his
voice
,
when
he
came
to
borrow
five
hundred
*NL*
dollars
for
that
purpose
;
and
that
I
had
seen
him
pass
on
his
way
to
the
*NL*
steamboat
.
Neither
were
they
aware
that
all
the
particulars
of
aunt
Nancy
's
*NL*
death
and
burial
were
conveyed
to
me
at
the
time
they
occurred
.
I
have
kept
*NL*
the
letter
,
of
which
I
herewith
subjoin
a
copy
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
Your
letter
to
sister
was
received
a
few
days
ago
.
I
gather
from
*NL*
it
that
you
are
desirous
of
returning
to
your
native
place
,
among
*NL*
your
friends
and
relatives
.
We
were
all
gratified
with
the
*NL*
contents
of
your
letter
;
and
let
me
assure
you
that
if
any
*NL*
members
of
the
family
have
had
any
feeling
of
resentment
towards
*NL*
you
,
they
feel
it
no
longer
.
We
all
sympathize
with
you
in
your
*NL*
unfortunate
condition
,
and
are
ready
to
do
all
in
our
power
to
*NL*
make
you
contented
and
happy
.
It
is
difficult
for
you
to
return
*NL*
home
as
a
free
person
.
If
you
were
purchased
by
your
grandmother
,
*NL*
it
is
doubtful
whether
you
would
be
permitted
to
remain
,
although
*NL*
it
would
be
lawful
for
you
to
do
so
.
If
a
servant
should
be
*NL*
allowed
to
purchase
herself
,
after
absenting
herself
so
long
from
*NL*
her
owners
,
and
return
free
,
it
would
have
an
injurious
effect
.
*NL*
From
your
letter
,
I
think
your
situation
must
be
hard
and
*NL*
uncomfortable
.
Come
home
.
You
have
it
in
your
power
to
be
*NL*
reinstated
in
our
affections
.
We
would
receive
you
with
open
arms
*NL*
and
tears
of
joy
.
You
need
not
apprehend
any
unkind
treatment
,
as
*NL*
we
have
not
put
ourselves
to
any
trouble
or
expense
to
get
you
.
*NL*
Had
we
done
so
,
perhaps
we
should
feel
otherwise
.
You
know
my
*NL*
sister
was
always
attached
to
you
,
and
that
you
were
never
*NL*
treated
as
a
slave
.
You
were
never
put
to
hard
work
,
nor
exposed
*NL*
to
field
labor
.
On
the
contrary
,
you
were
taken
into
the
house
,
*NL*
and
treated
as
one
of
us
,
and
almost
as
free
;
and
we
,
at
least
,
*NL*
felt
that
you
were
above
disgracing
yourself
by
running
away
.
*NL*
Believing
you
may
be
induced
to
come
home
voluntarily
has
induced
*NL*
me
to
write
for
my
sister
.
The
family
will
be
rejoiced
to
see
*NL*
you
;
and
your
poor
old
grandmother
expressed
a
great
desire
to
*NL*
have
you
come
,
when
she
heard
your
letter
read
.
In
her
old
age
*NL*
she
needs
the
consolation
of
having
her
children
round
her
.
*NL*
Doubtless
you
have
heard
of
the
death
of
your
aunt
.
She
was
a
*NL*
faithful
servant
,
and
a
faithful
member
of
the
Episcopal
church
.
*NL*
In
her
Christian
life
she
taught
us
how
to
live
--
and
,
O
,
too
high
*NL*
the
price
of
knowledge
,
she
taught
us
how
to
die
!
Could
you
have
*NL*
seen
us
round
her
death
bed
,
with
her
mother
,
all
mingling
our
*NL*
tears
in
one
common
stream
,
you
would
have
thought
the
same
*NL*
heartfelt
tie
existed
between
a
master
and
his
servant
,
as
*NL*
between
a
mother
and
her
child
.
But
this
subject
is
too
painful
*NL*
to
dwell
upon
.
I
must
bring
my
letter
to
a
close
.
If
you
are
*NL*
contented
to
stay
away
from
your
old
grandmother
,
your
child
,
and
*NL*
the
friends
who
love
you
,
stay
where
you
are
.
We
shall
never
*NL*
trouble
ourselves
to
apprehend
you
.
But
should
you
prefer
to
come
*NL*
home
,
we
will
do
all
that
we
can
to
make
you
happy
.
If
you
do
not
*NL*
wish
to
remain
in
the
family
,
I
know
that
father
,
by
our
*NL*
persuasion
,
will
be
induced
to
let
you
be
purchased
by
any
person
*NL*
you
may
choose
in
our
community
.
You
will
please
answer
this
as
*NL*
soon
as
possible
,
and
let
us
know
your
decision
.
Sister
sends
*NL*
much
love
to
you
.
In
the
mean
time
believe
me
your
sincere
friend
*NL*
and
well
wisher
.

This
letter
was
signed
by
Emily
's
brother
,
who
was
as
yet
a
mere
lad
.
I
*NL*
knew
,
by
the
style
,
that
it
was
not
written
by
a
person
of
his
age
,
and
*NL*
though
the
writing
was
disguised
,
I
had
been
made
too
unhappy
by
it
,
in
*NL*
former
years
,
not
to
recognize
at
once
the
hand
of
Dr.
Flint
.
O
,
the
*NL*
hypocrisy
of
slaveholders
!
Did
the
old
fox
suppose
I
was
goose
enough
to
go
*NL*
into
such
a
trap
?
Verily
,
he
relied
too
much
on
``
the
stupidity
of
the
*NL*
African
race
.
''
I
did
not
return
the
family
of
Flints
any
thanks
for
their
*NL*
cordial
invitation
--
a
remissness
for
which
I
was
,
no
doubt
,
charged
with
*NL*
base
ingratitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
long
afterwards
I
received
a
letter
from
one
of
my
friends
at
the
*NL*
south
,
informing
me
that
Dr.
Flint
was
about
to
visit
the
north
.
The
letter
*NL*
had
been
delayed
,
and
I
supposed
he
might
be
already
on
the
way
.
Mrs.
Bruce
*NL*
did
not
know
I
was
a
fugitive
.
I
told
her
that
important
business
called
me
*NL*
to
Boston
,
where
my
brother
then
was
,
and
asked
permission
to
bring
a
*NL*
friend
to
supply
my
place
as
nurse
,
for
a
fortnight
.
I
started
on
my
*NL*
journey
immediately
;
and
as
soon
as
I
arrived
,
I
wrote
to
my
grandmother
*NL*
that
if
Benny
came
,
he
must
be
sent
to
Boston
.
I
knew
she
was
only
waiting
*NL*
for
a
good
chance
to
send
him
north
,
and
,
fortunately
,
she
had
the
legal
*NL*
power
to
do
so
,
without
asking
leave
of
any
body
.
She
was
a
free
woman
;
and
*NL*
when
my
children
were
purchased
,
Mr.
Sands
preferred
to
have
the
bill
of
*NL*
sale
drawn
up
in
her
name
.
It
was
conjectured
that
he
advanced
the
money
,
*NL*
but
it
was
not
known
.
At
the
south
,
a
gentleman
may
have
a
shoal
of
colored
*NL*
children
without
any
disgrace
;
but
if
he
is
known
to
purchase
them
,
with
*NL*
the
view
of
setting
them
free
,
the
example
is
thought
to
be
dangerous
to
*NL*
their
``
peculiar
institution
,
''
and
he
becomes
unpopular
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
good
opportunity
to
send
Benny
in
a
vessel
coming
directly
to
*NL*
New
York
.
He
was
put
on
board
with
a
letter
to
a
friend
,
who
was
requested
*NL*
to
see
him
off
to
Boston
.
Early
one
morning
,
there
was
a
loud
rap
at
my
*NL*
door
,
and
in
rushed
Benjamin
,
all
out
of
breath
.
``
O
mother
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
*NL*
``
here
I
am
!
I
run
all
the
way
;
and
I
come
all
alone
.
How
d'you
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
O
reader
,
can
you
imagine
my
joy
?
No
,
you
can
not
,
unless
you
have
been
a
*NL*
slave
mother
.
Benjamin
rattled
away
as
fast
as
his
tongue
could
go
.
*NL*
``
Mother
,
why
do
n't
you
bring
Ellen
here
?
I
went
over
to
Brooklyn
to
see
*NL*
her
,
and
she
felt
very
bad
when
I
bid
her
good
by
.
She
said
,
'
O
Ben
,
I
wish
*NL*
I
was
going
too
.
'
I
thought
she
'd
know
ever
so
much
;
but
she
do
n't
know
so
*NL*
much
as
I
do
;
for
I
can
read
,
and
she
ca
n't
.
And
,
mother
,
I
lost
all
my
*NL*
clothes
coming
.
What
can
I
do
to
get
some
more
?
I
`
spose
free
boys
can
get
*NL*
along
here
at
the
north
as
well
as
white
boys
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
not
like
to
tell
the
sanguine
,
happy
little
fellow
how
much
he
was
*NL*
mistaken
.
I
took
him
to
a
tailor
,
and
procured
a
change
of
clothes
.
The
*NL*
rest
of
the
day
was
spent
in
mutual
asking
and
answering
of
questions
,
with
*NL*
the
wish
constantly
repeated
that
the
good
old
grandmother
was
with
us
,
and
*NL*
frequent
injunctions
from
Benny
to
write
to
her
immediately
,
and
be
sure
to
*NL*
tell
her
every
thing
about
his
voyage
,
and
his
journey
to
Boston
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Flint
made
his
visit
to
New
York
,
and
made
every
exertion
to
call
upon
*NL*
me
,
and
invite
me
to
return
with
him
,
but
not
being
able
to
ascertain
where
*NL*
I
was
,
his
hospitable
intentions
were
frustrated
,
and
the
affectionate
*NL*
family
,
who
were
waiting
for
me
with
``
open
arms
,
''
were
doomed
to
*NL*
disappointment
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
I
knew
he
was
safely
at
home
,
I
placed
Benjamin
in
the
care
of
*NL*
my
brother
William
,
and
returned
to
Mrs.
Bruce
.
There
I
remained
through
*NL*
the
winter
and
spring
,
endeavoring
to
perform
my
duties
faithfully
,
and
*NL*
finding
a
good
degree
of
happiness
in
the
attractions
of
baby
Mary
,
the
*NL*
considerate
kindness
of
her
excellent
mother
,
and
occasional
interviews
*NL*
with
my
darling
daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
summer
came
,
the
old
feeling
of
insecurity
haunted
me
.
It
was
*NL*
necessary
for
me
to
take
little
Mary
out
daily
,
for
exercise
and
fresh
air
,
*NL*
and
the
city
was
swarming
with
Southerners
,
some
of
whom
might
recognize
*NL*
me
.
Hot
weather
brings
out
snakes
and
slaveholders
,
and
I
like
one
class
of
*NL*
the
venomous
creatures
as
little
as
I
do
the
other
.
What
a
comfort
it
is
,
*NL*
to
be
free
to
_
say
_
so
!

Prejudice
Against

.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
relief
to
my
mind
to
see
preparations
for
leaving
the
city
.
We
*NL*
went
to
Albany
in
the
steamboat
Knickerbocker
.
When
the
gong
sounded
for
*NL*
tea
,
Mrs.
Bruce
said
,
``
Linda
,
it
is
late
,
and
you
and
baby
had
better
come
*NL*
to
the
table
with
me
.
''
I
replied
,
``
I
know
it
is
time
baby
had
her
supper
,
*NL*
but
I
had
rather
not
go
with
you
,
if
you
please
.
I
am
afraid
of
being
*NL*
insulted
.
''
``
O
no
,
not
if
you
are
with
_
me
_
,
''
she
said
.
I
saw
several
white
*NL*
nurses
go
with
their
ladies
,
and
I
ventured
to
do
the
same
.
We
were
at
the
*NL*
extreme
end
of
the
table
.
I
was
no
sooner
seated
,
than
a
gruff
voice
said
,
*NL*
``
Get
up
!
You
know
you
are
not
allowed
to
sit
here
.
''
I
looked
up
,
and
,
to
my
*NL*
astonishment
and
indignation
,
saw
that
the
speaker
was
a
colored
man
.
If
*NL*
his
office
required
him
to
enforce
the
by-laws
of
the
boat
,
he
might
,
at
*NL*
least
,
have
done
it
politely
.
I
replied
,
``
I
shall
not
get
up
,
unless
the
*NL*
captain
comes
and
takes
me
up
.
''
No
cup
of
tea
was
offered
me
,
but
Mrs.
*NL*
Bruce
handed
me
hers
and
called
for
another
.
I
looked
to
see
whether
the
*NL*
other
nurses
were
treated
in
a
similar
manner
.
They
were
all
properly
*NL*
waited
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
morning
,
when
we
stopped
at
Troy
for
breakfast
,
every
body
was
making
*NL*
a
rush
for
the
table
.
Mrs.
Bruce
said
,
``
Take
my
arm
,
Linda
,
and
we
'll
go
in
*NL*
together
.
''
The
landlord
heard
her
,
and
said
,
``
Madam
,
will
you
allow
your
*NL*
nurse
and
baby
to
take
breakfast
with
my
family
?
''
I
knew
this
was
to
be
*NL*
attributed
to
my
complexion
;
but
he
spoke
courteously
,
and
therefore
I
did
*NL*
not
mind
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
Saratoga
we
found
the
United
States
Hotel
crowded
,
and
Mr.
Bruce
took
*NL*
one
of
the
cottages
belonging
to
the
hotel
.
I
had
thought
,
with
gladness
,
*NL*
of
going
to
the
quiet
of
the
country
,
where
I
should
meet
few
people
,
but
*NL*
here
I
found
myself
in
the
midst
of
a
swarm
of
Southerners
.
I
looked
round
*NL*
me
with
fear
and
trembling
,
dreading
to
see
some
one
who
would
recognize
*NL*
me
.
I
was
rejoiced
to
find
that
we
were
to
stay
but
a
short
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
soon
returned
to
New
York
,
to
make
arrangements
for
spending
the
*NL*
remainder
of
the
summer
at
Rockaway
.
While
the
laundress
was
putting
the
*NL*
clothes
in
order
,
I
took
an
opportunity
to
go
over
to
Brooklyn
to
see
*NL*
Ellen
.
I
met
her
going
to
a
grocery
store
,
and
the
first
words
she
said
,
*NL*
were
,
``
O
,
mother
,
do
n't
go
to
Mrs.
Hobbs
's
.
Her
brother
,
Mr.
Thorne
,
has
*NL*
come
from
the
south
,
and
may
be
he
'll
tell
where
you
are
.
''
I
accepted
the
*NL*
warning
.
I
told
her
I
was
going
away
with
Mrs.
Bruce
the
next
day
,
and
*NL*
would
try
to
see
her
when
I
came
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
Being
in
servitude
to
the
Anglo-Saxon
race
,
I
was
not
put
into
a
``
Jim
Crow
*NL*
car
,
''
on
our
way
to
Rockaway
,
neither
was
I
invited
to
ride
through
the
*NL*
streets
on
the
top
of
trunks
in
a
truck
;
but
every
where
I
found
the
same
*NL*
manifestations
of
that
cruel
prejudice
,
which
so
discourages
the
feelings
,
*NL*
and
represses
the
energies
of
the
colored
people
.
We
reached
Rockaway
*NL*
before
dark
,
and
put
up
at
the
Pavilion
--
a
large
hotel
,
beautifully
*NL*
situated
by
the
sea-side
--
a
great
resort
of
the
fashionable
world
.
Thirty
*NL*
or
forty
nurses
were
there
,
of
a
great
variety
of
nations
.
Some
of
the
*NL*
ladies
had
colored
waiting-maids
and
coachmen
,
but
I
was
the
only
nurse
*NL*
tinged
with
the
blood
of
Africa
.
When
the
tea
bell
rang
,
I
took
little
Mary
*NL*
and
followed
the
other
nurses
.
Supper
was
served
in
a
long
hall
.
A
young
*NL*
man
,
who
had
the
ordering
of
things
,
took
the
circuit
of
the
table
two
or
*NL*
three
times
,
and
finally
pointed
me
to
a
seat
at
the
lower
end
of
it
.
As
*NL*
there
was
but
one
chair
,
I
sat
down
and
took
the
child
in
my
lap
.
Whereupon
*NL*
the
young
man
came
to
me
and
said
,
in
the
blandest
manner
possible
,
``
Will
*NL*
you
please
to
seat
the
little
girl
in
the
chair
,
and
stand
behind
it
and
*NL*
feed
her
?
After
they
have
done
,
you
will
be
shown
to
the
kitchen
,
where
you
*NL*
will
have
a
good
supper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
climax
!
I
found
it
hard
to
preserve
my
self-control
,
when
I
*NL*
looked
round
,
and
saw
women
who
were
nurses
,
as
I
was
,
and
only
one
shade
*NL*
lighter
in
complexion
,
eyeing
me
with
a
defiant
look
,
as
if
my
presence
*NL*
were
a
contamination
.
However
,
I
said
nothing
.
I
quietly
took
the
child
in
*NL*
my
arms
,
went
to
our
room
,
and
refused
to
go
to
the
table
again
.
Mr.
Bruce
*NL*
ordered
meals
to
be
sent
to
the
room
for
little
Mary
and
I
.
This
answered
*NL*
for
a
few
days
;
but
the
waiters
of
the
establishment
were
white
,
and
they
*NL*
soon
began
to
complain
,
saying
they
were
not
hired
to
wait
on
negroes
.
The
*NL*
landlord
requested
Mr.
Bruce
to
send
me
down
to
my
meals
,
because
his
*NL*
servants
rebelled
against
bringing
them
up
,
and
the
colored
servants
of
*NL*
other
boarders
were
dissatisfied
because
all
were
not
treated
alike
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
answer
was
that
the
colored
servants
ought
to
be
dissatisfied
with
*NL*
_
themselves
_
,
for
not
having
too
much
self-respect
to
submit
to
such
*NL*
treatment
;
that
there
was
no
difference
in
the
price
of
board
for
colored
*NL*
and
white
servants
,
and
there
was
no
justification
for
difference
of
*NL*
treatment
.
I
staid
a
month
after
this
,
and
finding
I
was
resolved
to
stand
*NL*
up
for
my
rights
,
they
concluded
to
treat
me
well
.
Let
every
colored
man
*NL*
and
woman
do
this
,
and
eventually
we
shall
cease
to
be
trampled
under
foot
*NL*
by
our
oppressors
.

The
Hairbreadth
Escape
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
After
we
returned
to
New
York
,
I
took
the
earliest
opportunity
to
go
and
*NL*
see
Ellen
.
I
asked
to
have
her
called
down
stairs
;
for
I
supposed
Mrs.
*NL*
Hobbs
's
southern
brother
might
still
be
there
,
and
I
was
desirous
to
avoid
*NL*
seeing
him
,
if
possible
.
But
Mrs.
Hobbs
came
to
the
kitchen
,
and
insisted
*NL*
on
my
going
up
stairs
.
``
My
brother
wants
to
see
you
,
''
said
she
,
``
and
he
is
*NL*
sorry
you
seem
to
shun
him
.
He
knows
you
are
living
in
New
York
.
He
told
me
*NL*
to
say
to
you
that
he
owes
thanks
to
good
old
aunt
Martha
for
too
many
*NL*
little
acts
of
kindness
for
him
to
be
base
enough
to
betray
her
*NL*
grandchild
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
Mr.
Thorne
had
become
poor
and
reckless
long
before
he
left
the
south
,
*NL*
and
such
persons
had
much
rather
go
to
one
of
the
faithful
old
slaves
to
*NL*
borrow
a
dollar
,
or
get
a
good
dinner
,
than
to
go
to
one
whom
they
consider
*NL*
an
equal
.
It
was
such
acts
of
kindness
as
these
for
which
he
professed
to
*NL*
feel
grateful
to
my
grandmother
.
I
wished
he
had
kept
at
a
distance
,
but
as
*NL*
he
was
here
,
and
knew
where
I
was
,
I
concluded
there
was
nothing
to
be
*NL*
gained
by
trying
to
avoid
him
;
on
the
contrary
,
it
might
be
the
means
of
*NL*
exciting
his
ill
will
.
I
followed
his
sister
up
stairs
.
He
met
me
in
a
very
*NL*
friendly
manner
,
congratulated
me
on
my
escape
from
slavery
,
and
hoped
I
*NL*
had
a
good
place
,
where
I
felt
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
continued
to
visit
Ellen
as
often
as
I
could
.
She
,
good
thoughtful
child
,
*NL*
never
forgot
my
hazardous
situation
,
but
always
kept
a
vigilant
lookout
for
*NL*
my
safety
.
She
never
made
any
complaint
about
her
own
inconveniences
and
*NL*
troubles
;
but
a
mother
's
observing
eye
easily
perceived
that
she
was
not
*NL*
happy
.
On
the
occasion
of
one
of
my
visits
I
found
her
unusually
serious
.
*NL*
When
I
asked
her
what
was
the
matter
,
she
said
nothing
was
the
matter
.
But
*NL*
I
insisted
upon
knowing
what
made
her
look
so
very
grave
.
Finally
,
I
*NL*
ascertained
that
she
felt
troubled
about
the
dissipation
that
was
*NL*
continually
going
on
in
the
house
.
She
was
sent
to
the
store
very
often
for
*NL*
rum
and
brandy
,
and
she
felt
ashamed
to
ask
for
it
so
often
;
and
Mr.
Hobbs
*NL*
and
Mr.
Thorne
drank
a
great
deal
,
and
their
hands
trembled
so
that
they
*NL*
had
to
call
her
to
pour
out
the
liquor
for
them
.
``
But
for
all
that
,
''
said
*NL*
she
,
``
Mr.
Hobbs
is
good
to
me
,
and
I
ca
n't
help
liking
him
.
I
feel
sorry
*NL*
for
him
.
''
I
tried
to
comfort
her
,
by
telling
her
that
I
had
laid
up
a
*NL*
hundred
dollars
,
and
that
before
long
I
hoped
to
be
able
to
give
her
and
*NL*
Benjamin
a
home
,
and
send
them
to
school
.
She
was
always
desirous
not
to
*NL*
add
to
my
troubles
more
than
she
could
help
,
and
I
did
not
discover
till
*NL*
years
afterwards
that
Mr.
Thorne
's
intemperance
was
not
the
only
annoyance
*NL*
she
suffered
from
him
.
Though
he
professed
too
much
gratitude
to
my
*NL*
grandmother
to
injure
any
of
her
descendants
,
he
had
poured
vile
language
*NL*
into
the
ears
of
her
innocent
great-grandchild
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
usually
went
to
Brooklyn
to
spend
Sunday
afternoon
.
One
Sunday
,
I
found
*NL*
Ellen
anxiously
waiting
for
me
near
the
house
.
``
O
,
mother
,
''
said
she
,
``
I
've
*NL*
been
waiting
for
you
this
long
time
.
I
'm
afraid
Mr.
Thorne
has
written
to
*NL*
tell
Dr.
Flint
where
you
are
.
Make
haste
and
come
in
.
Mrs.
Hobbs
will
tell
*NL*
you
all
about
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
story
was
soon
told
.
While
the
children
were
playing
in
the
grape-vine
*NL*
arbor
,
the
day
before
,
Mr.
Thorne
came
out
with
a
letter
in
his
hand
,
which
*NL*
he
tore
up
and
scattered
about
.
Ellen
was
sweeping
the
yard
at
the
time
,
*NL*
and
having
her
mind
full
of
suspicions
of
him
,
she
picked
up
the
pieces
and
*NL*
carried
them
to
the
children
,
saying
,
``
I
wonder
who
Mr.
Thorne
has
been
*NL*
writing
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
I
do
n't
know
,
and
do
n't
care
,
''
replied
the
oldest
of
the
*NL*
children
;
``
and
I
do
n't
see
how
it
concerns
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
does
concern
me
,
''
replied
Ellen
;
``
for
I
'm
afraid
he
's
been
*NL*
writing
to
the
south
about
my
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
laughed
at
her
,
and
called
her
a
silly
thing
,
but
good-naturedly
put
*NL*
the
fragments
of
writing
together
,
in
order
to
read
them
to
her
.
They
were
*NL*
no
sooner
arranged
,
than
the
little
girl
exclaimed
,
``
I
declare
,
Ellen
,
I
*NL*
believe
you
are
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
contents
of
Mr.
Thorne
's
letter
,
as
nearly
as
I
can
remember
,
were
as
*NL*
follows
:
``
I
have
seen
your
slave
,
Linda
,
and
conversed
with
her
.
She
can
be
*NL*
taken
very
easily
,
if
you
manage
prudently
.
There
are
enough
of
us
here
to
*NL*
swear
to
her
identity
as
your
property
.
I
am
a
patriot
,
a
lover
of
my
*NL*
country
,
and
I
do
this
as
an
act
of
justice
to
the
laws
.
''
He
concluded
by
*NL*
informing
the
doctor
of
the
street
and
number
where
I
lived
.
The
children
*NL*
carried
the
pieces
to
Mrs.
Hobbs
,
who
immediately
went
to
her
brother
's
*NL*
room
for
an
explanation
.
He
was
not
to
be
found
.
The
servants
said
they
saw
*NL*
him
go
out
with
a
letter
in
his
hand
,
and
they
supposed
he
had
gone
to
the
*NL*
post
office
.
The
natural
inference
was
,
that
he
had
sent
to
Dr.
Flint
a
*NL*
copy
of
those
fragments
.
When
he
returned
,
his
sister
accused
him
of
it
,
*NL*
and
he
did
not
deny
the
charge
.
He
went
immediately
to
his
room
,
and
the
*NL*
next
morning
he
was
missing
.
He
had
gone
over
to
New
York
,
before
any
of
*NL*
the
family
were
astir
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
evident
that
I
had
no
time
to
lose
;
and
I
hastened
back
to
the
city
*NL*
with
a
heavy
heart
.
Again
I
was
to
be
torn
from
a
comfortable
home
,
and
all
*NL*
my
plans
for
the
welfare
of
my
children
were
to
be
frustrated
by
that
demon
*NL*
Slavery
!
I
now
regretted
that
I
never
told
Mrs.
Bruce
my
story
.
I
had
not
*NL*
concealed
it
merely
on
account
of
being
a
fugitive
;
that
would
have
made
*NL*
her
anxious
,
but
it
would
have
excited
sympathy
in
her
kind
heart
.
I
valued
*NL*
her
good
opinion
,
and
I
was
afraid
of
losing
it
,
if
I
told
her
all
the
*NL*
particulars
of
my
sad
story
.
But
now
I
felt
that
it
was
necessary
for
her
*NL*
to
know
how
I
was
situated
.
I
had
once
left
her
abruptly
,
without
*NL*
explaining
the
reason
,
and
it
would
not
be
proper
to
do
it
again
.
I
went
*NL*
home
resolved
to
tell
her
in
the
morning
.
But
the
sadness
of
my
face
*NL*
attracted
her
attention
,
and
,
in
answer
to
her
kind
inquiries
,
I
poured
out
*NL*
my
full
heart
to
her
,
before
bed
time
.
She
listened
with
true
womanly
*NL*
sympathy
,
and
told
me
she
would
do
all
she
could
to
protect
me
.
How
my
*NL*
heart
blessed
her
!
*NL*
*NL*
Early
the
next
morning
,
Judge
Vanderpool
and
Lawyer
Hopper
were
consulted
.
*NL*
They
said
I
had
better
leave
the
city
at
once
,
as
the
risk
would
be
great
*NL*
if
the
case
came
to
trial
.
Mrs.
Bruce
took
me
in
a
carriage
to
the
house
of
*NL*
one
of
her
friends
,
where
she
assured
me
I
should
be
safe
until
my
brother
*NL*
could
arrive
,
which
would
be
in
a
few
days
.
In
the
interval
my
thoughts
*NL*
were
much
occupied
with
Ellen
.
She
was
mine
by
birth
,
and
she
was
also
mine
*NL*
by
Southern
law
,
since
my
grandmother
held
the
bill
of
sale
that
made
her
*NL*
so
.
I
did
not
feel
that
she
was
safe
unless
I
had
her
with
me
.
Mrs.
Hobbs
,
*NL*
who
felt
badly
about
her
brother
's
treachery
,
yielded
to
my
entreaties
,
on
*NL*
condition
that
she
should
return
in
ten
days
.
I
avoided
making
any
promise
.
*NL*
She
came
to
me
clad
in
very
thin
garments
,
all
outgrown
,
and
with
a
school
*NL*
satchel
on
her
arm
,
containing
a
few
articles
.
It
was
late
in
October
,
and
*NL*
I
knew
the
child
must
suffer
;
and
not
daring
to
go
out
in
the
streets
to
*NL*
purchase
any
thing
,
I
took
off
my
own
flannel
skirt
and
converted
it
into
*NL*
one
for
her
.
Kind
Mrs.
Bruce
came
to
bid
me
good
by
,
and
when
she
saw
that
*NL*
I
had
taken
off
my
clothing
for
my
child
,
the
tears
came
to
her
eyes
.
She
*NL*
said
,
``
Wait
for
me
,
Linda
,
''
and
went
out
.
She
soon
returned
with
a
nice
*NL*
warm
shawl
and
hood
for
Ellen
.
Truly
,
of
such
souls
as
hers
are
the
kingdom
*NL*
of
heaven
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
brother
reached
New
York
on
Wednesday
.
Lawyer
Hopper
advised
us
to
go
to
*NL*
Boston
by
the
Stonington
route
,
as
there
was
less
Southern
travel
in
that
*NL*
direction
.
Mrs.
Bruce
directed
her
servants
to
tell
all
inquirers
that
I
*NL*
formerly
lived
there
,
but
had
gone
from
the
city
.
We
reached
the
steamboat
*NL*
Rhode
Island
in
safety
.
That
boat
employed
colored
hands
,
but
I
knew
that
*NL*
colored
passengers
were
not
admitted
to
the
cabin
.
I
was
very
desirous
for
*NL*
the
seclusion
of
the
cabin
,
not
only
on
account
of
exposure
to
the
night
*NL*
air
,
but
also
to
avoid
observation
.
Lawyer
Hopper
was
waiting
on
board
for
*NL*
us
.
He
spoke
to
the
stewardess
,
and
asked
,
as
a
particular
favor
,
that
she
*NL*
would
treat
us
well
.
He
said
to
me
,
``
Go
and
speak
to
the
captain
yourself
*NL*
by
and
by
.
Take
your
little
girl
with
you
,
and
I
am
sure
that
he
will
not
*NL*
let
her
sleep
on
deck
.
''
With
these
kind
words
and
a
shake
of
the
hand
he
*NL*
departed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boat
was
soon
on
her
way
,
bearing
me
rapidly
from
the
friendly
home
*NL*
where
I
had
hoped
to
find
security
and
rest
.
My
brother
had
left
me
to
*NL*
purchase
the
tickets
,
thinking
that
I
might
have
better
success
than
he
*NL*
would
.
When
the
stewardess
came
to
me
,
I
paid
what
she
asked
,
and
she
gave
*NL*
me
three
tickets
with
clipped
corners
.
In
the
most
unsophisticated
manner
I
*NL*
said
,
``
You
have
made
a
mistake
;
I
asked
you
for
cabin
tickets
.
I
can
not
*NL*
possibly
consent
to
sleep
on
deck
with
my
little
daughter
.
''
She
assured
me
*NL*
there
was
no
mistake
.
She
said
on
some
of
the
routes
colored
people
were
*NL*
allowed
to
sleep
in
the
cabin
,
but
not
on
this
route
,
which
was
much
*NL*
travelled
by
the
wealthy
.
I
asked
her
to
show
me
to
the
captain
's
office
,
*NL*
and
she
said
she
would
after
tea
.
When
the
time
came
,
I
took
Ellen
by
the
*NL*
hand
and
went
to
the
captain
,
politely
requesting
him
to
change
our
*NL*
tickets
,
as
we
should
be
very
uncomfortable
on
deck
.
He
said
it
was
*NL*
contrary
to
their
custom
,
but
he
would
see
that
we
had
berths
below
;
he
*NL*
would
also
try
to
obtain
comfortable
seats
for
us
in
the
cars
;
of
that
he
*NL*
was
not
certain
,
but
he
would
speak
to
the
conductor
about
it
,
when
the
*NL*
boat
arrived
.
I
thanked
him
,
and
returned
to
the
ladies
'
cabin
.
He
came
*NL*
afterwards
and
told
me
that
the
conductor
of
the
cars
was
on
board
,
that
he
*NL*
had
spoken
to
him
,
and
he
had
promised
to
take
care
of
us
.
I
was
very
much
*NL*
surprised
at
receiving
so
much
kindness
.
I
do
n't
know
whether
the
pleasing
*NL*
face
of
my
little
girl
had
won
his
heart
,
or
whether
the
stewardess
*NL*
inferred
from
Lawyer
Hopper
's
manner
that
I
was
a
fugitive
,
and
had
pleaded
*NL*
with
him
in
my
behalf
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
boat
arrived
at
Stonington
,
the
conductor
kept
his
promise
,
and
*NL*
showed
us
to
seats
in
the
first
car
,
nearest
the
engine
.
He
asked
us
to
*NL*
take
seats
next
the
door
,
but
as
he
passed
through
,
we
ventured
to
move
on
*NL*
toward
the
other
end
of
the
car
.
No
incivility
was
offered
us
,
and
we
*NL*
reached
Boston
in
safety
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
after
my
arrival
was
one
of
the
happiest
of
my
life
.
I
felt
as
if
I
*NL*
was
beyond
the
reach
of
the
bloodhounds
;
and
,
for
the
first
time
during
*NL*
many
years
,
I
had
both
my
children
together
with
me
.
They
greatly
enjoyed
*NL*
their
reunion
,
and
laughed
and
chatted
merrily
.
I
watched
them
with
a
*NL*
swelling
heart
.
Their
every
motion
delighted
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
feel
safe
in
New
York
,
and
I
accepted
the
offer
of
a
friend
,
*NL*
that
we
should
share
expenses
and
keep
house
together
.
I
represented
to
*NL*
Mrs.
Hobbs
that
Ellen
must
have
some
schooling
,
and
must
remain
with
me
for
*NL*
that
purpose
.
She
felt
ashamed
of
being
unable
to
read
or
spell
at
her
age
,
*NL*
so
instead
of
sending
her
to
school
with
Benny
,
I
instructed
her
myself
*NL*
till
she
was
fitted
to
enter
an
intermediate
school
.
The
winter
passed
*NL*
pleasantly
,
while
I
was
busy
with
my
needle
,
and
my
children
with
their
*NL*
books
.

A
Visit
To
England
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
spring
,
sad
news
came
to
me
.
Mrs.
Bruce
was
dead
.
Never
again
,
in
*NL*
this
world
,
should
I
see
her
gentle
face
,
or
hear
her
sympathizing
voice
.
I
*NL*
had
lost
an
excellent
friend
,
and
little
Mary
had
lost
a
tender
mother
.
Mr.
*NL*
Bruce
wished
the
child
to
visit
some
of
her
mother
's
relatives
in
England
,
*NL*
and
he
was
desirous
that
I
should
take
charge
of
her
.
The
little
motherless
*NL*
one
was
accustomed
to
me
,
and
attached
to
me
,
and
I
thought
she
would
be
*NL*
happier
in
my
care
than
in
that
of
a
stranger
.
I
could
also
earn
more
in
*NL*
this
way
than
I
could
by
my
needle
.
So
I
put
Benny
to
a
trade
,
and
left
*NL*
Ellen
to
remain
in
the
house
with
my
friend
and
go
to
school
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
sailed
from
New
York
,
and
arrived
in
Liverpool
after
a
pleasant
voyage
*NL*
of
twelve
days
.
We
proceeded
directly
to
London
,
and
took
lodgings
at
the
*NL*
Adelaide
Hotel
.
The
supper
seemed
to
me
less
luxurious
than
those
I
had
*NL*
seen
in
American
hotels
;
but
my
situation
was
indescribably
more
pleasant
.
*NL*
For
the
first
time
in
my
life
I
was
in
a
place
where
I
was
treated
*NL*
according
to
my
deportment
,
without
reference
to
my
complexion
.
I
felt
as
*NL*
if
a
great
millstone
had
been
lifted
from
my
breast
.
Ensconced
in
a
*NL*
pleasant
room
,
with
my
dear
little
charge
,
I
laid
my
head
on
my
pillow
,
for
*NL*
the
first
time
,
with
the
delightful
consciousness
of
pure
,
unadulterated
*NL*
freedom
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
had
constant
care
of
the
child
,
I
had
little
opportunity
to
see
the
*NL*
wonders
of
that
great
city
;
but
I
watched
the
tide
of
life
that
flowed
*NL*
through
the
streets
,
and
found
it
a
strange
contrast
to
the
stagnation
in
*NL*
our
Southern
towns
.
Mr.
Bruce
took
his
little
daughter
to
spend
some
days
*NL*
with
friends
in
Oxford
Crescent
,
and
of
course
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
*NL*
accompany
her
.
I
had
heard
much
of
the
systematic
method
of
English
*NL*
education
,
and
I
was
very
desirous
that
my
dear
Mary
should
steer
straight
*NL*
in
the
midst
of
so
much
propriety
.
I
closely
observed
her
little
playmates
*NL*
and
their
nurses
,
being
ready
to
take
any
lessons
in
the
science
of
good
*NL*
management
.
The
children
were
more
rosy
than
American
children
,
but
I
did
*NL*
not
see
that
they
differed
materially
in
other
respects
.
They
were
like
all
*NL*
children
--
sometimes
docile
and
sometimes
wayward
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
next
went
to
Steventon
,
in
Berkshire
.
It
was
a
small
town
,
said
to
be
*NL*
the
poorest
in
the
county
.
I
saw
men
working
in
the
fields
for
six
*NL*
shillings
,
and
seven
shillings
,
a
week
,
and
women
for
sixpence
,
and
*NL*
sevenpence
,
a
day
,
out
of
which
they
boarded
themselves
.
Of
course
they
*NL*
lived
in
the
most
primitive
manner
;
it
could
not
be
otherwise
,
where
a
*NL*
woman
's
wages
for
an
entire
day
were
not
sufficient
to
buy
a
pound
of
meat
.
*NL*
They
paid
very
low
rents
,
and
their
clothes
were
made
of
the
cheapest
*NL*
fabrics
,
though
much
better
than
could
have
been
procured
in
the
United
*NL*
States
for
the
same
money
.
I
had
heard
much
about
the
oppression
of
the
*NL*
poor
in
Europe
.
The
people
I
saw
around
me
were
,
many
of
them
,
among
the
*NL*
poorest
poor
.
But
when
I
visited
them
in
their
little
thatched
cottages
,
I
*NL*
felt
that
the
condition
of
even
the
meanest
and
most
ignorant
among
them
*NL*
was
vastly
superior
to
the
condition
of
the
most
favored
slaves
in
America
.
*NL*
They
labored
hard
;
but
they
were
not
ordered
out
to
toil
while
the
stars
*NL*
were
in
the
sky
,
and
driven
and
slashed
by
an
overseer
,
through
heat
and
*NL*
cold
,
till
the
stars
shone
out
again
.
Their
homes
were
very
humble
;
but
*NL*
they
were
protected
by
law
.
No
insolent
patrols
could
come
,
in
the
dead
of
*NL*
night
,
and
flog
them
at
their
pleasure
.
The
father
,
when
he
closed
his
*NL*
cottage
door
,
felt
safe
with
his
family
around
him
.
No
master
or
overseer
*NL*
could
come
and
take
from
him
his
wife
,
or
his
daughter
.
They
must
separate
*NL*
to
earn
their
living
;
but
the
parents
knew
where
their
children
were
going
,
*NL*
and
could
communicate
with
them
by
letters
.
The
relations
of
husband
and
*NL*
wife
,
parent
and
child
,
were
too
sacred
for
the
richest
noble
in
the
land
*NL*
to
violate
with
impunity
.
Much
was
being
done
to
enlighten
these
poor
*NL*
people
.
Schools
were
established
among
them
,
and
benevolent
societies
were
*NL*
active
in
efforts
to
ameliorate
their
condition
.
There
was
no
law
*NL*
forbidding
them
to
learn
to
read
and
write
;
and
if
they
helped
each
other
*NL*
in
spelling
out
the
Bible
,
they
were
in
no
danger
of
thirty-nine
lashes
,
as
*NL*
was
the
case
with
myself
and
poor
,
pious
,
old
uncle
Fred
.
I
repeat
that
the
*NL*
most
ignorant
and
the
most
destitute
of
these
peasants
was
a
thousand
fold
*NL*
better
off
than
the
most
pampered
American
slave
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
not
deny
that
the
poor
are
oppressed
in
Europe
.
I
am
not
disposed
to
*NL*
paint
their
condition
so
rose-colored
as
the
Hon.
Miss
Murray
paints
the
*NL*
condition
of
the
slaves
in
the
United
States
.
A
small
portion
of
_
my
_
*NL*
experience
would
enable
her
to
read
her
own
pages
with
anointed
eyes
.
If
*NL*
she
were
to
lay
aside
her
title
,
and
,
instead
of
visiting
among
the
*NL*
fashionable
,
become
domesticated
,
as
a
poor
governess
,
on
some
plantation
*NL*
in
Louisiana
or
Alabama
,
she
would
see
and
hear
things
that
would
make
her
*NL*
tell
quite
a
different
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
visit
to
England
is
a
memorable
event
in
my
life
,
from
the
fact
of
my
*NL*
having
there
received
strong
religious
impressions
.
The
contemptuous
manner
*NL*
in
which
the
communion
had
been
administered
to
colored
people
,
in
my
*NL*
native
place
;
the
church
membership
of
Dr.
Flint
,
and
others
like
him
;
and
*NL*
the
buying
and
selling
of
slaves
,
by
professed
ministers
of
the
gospel
,
had
*NL*
given
me
a
prejudice
against
the
Episcopal
church
.
The
whole
service
seemed
*NL*
to
me
a
mockery
and
a
sham
.
But
my
home
in
Steventon
was
in
the
family
of
a
*NL*
clergyman
,
who
was
a
true
disciple
of
Jesus
.
The
beauty
of
his
daily
life
*NL*
inspired
me
with
faith
in
the
genuineness
of
Christian
professions
.
Grace
*NL*
entered
my
heart
,
and
I
knelt
at
the
communion
table
,
I
trust
,
in
true
*NL*
humility
of
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
remained
abroad
ten
months
,
which
was
much
longer
than
I
had
anticipated
.
*NL*
During
all
that
time
,
I
never
saw
the
slightest
symptom
of
prejudice
*NL*
against
color
.
Indeed
,
I
entirely
forgot
it
,
till
the
time
came
for
us
to
*NL*
return
to
America
.

XXXVIII
.
Renewed
Invitations
To
Go
South
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
a
tedious
winter
passage
,
and
from
the
distance
spectres
seemed
to
*NL*
rise
up
on
the
shores
of
the
United
States
.
It
is
a
sad
feeling
to
be
*NL*
afraid
of
one
's
native
country
.
We
arrived
in
New
York
safely
,
and
I
*NL*
hastened
to
Boston
to
look
after
my
children
.
I
found
Ellen
well
,
and
*NL*
improving
at
her
school
;
but
Benny
was
not
there
to
welcome
me
.
He
had
been
*NL*
left
at
a
good
place
to
learn
a
trade
,
and
for
several
months
every
thing
*NL*
worked
well
.
He
was
liked
by
the
master
,
and
was
a
favorite
with
his
*NL*
fellow-apprentices
;
but
one
day
they
accidentally
discovered
a
fact
they
*NL*
had
never
before
suspected
--
that
he
was
colored
!
This
at
once
transformed
*NL*
him
into
a
different
being
.
Some
of
the
apprentices
were
Americans
,
others
*NL*
American-born
Irish
;
and
it
was
offensive
to
their
dignity
to
have
a
*NL*
``
nigger
''
among
them
,
after
they
had
been
told
that
he
_
was
_
a
``
nigger
.
''
*NL*
They
began
by
treating
him
with
silent
scorn
,
and
finding
that
he
returned
*NL*
the
same
,
they
resorted
to
insults
and
abuse
.
He
was
too
spirited
a
boy
to
*NL*
stand
that
,
and
he
went
off
.
Being
desirous
to
do
something
to
support
*NL*
himself
,
and
having
no
one
to
advise
him
,
he
shipped
for
a
whaling
voyage
.
*NL*
When
I
received
these
tidings
I
shed
many
tears
,
and
bitterly
reproached
*NL*
myself
for
having
left
him
so
long
.
But
I
had
done
it
for
the
best
,
and
now
*NL*
all
I
could
do
was
to
pray
to
the
heavenly
Father
to
guide
and
protect
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
long
after
my
return
,
I
received
the
following
letter
from
Miss
Emily
*NL*
Flint
,
now
Mrs.
Dodge
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
you
will
recognize
the
hand
of
your
friend
and
mistress
.
*NL*
Having
heard
that
you
had
gone
with
a
family
to
Europe
,
I
have
*NL*
waited
to
hear
of
your
return
to
write
to
you
.
I
should
have
*NL*
answered
the
letter
you
wrote
to
me
long
since
,
but
as
I
could
*NL*
not
then
act
independently
of
my
father
,
I
knew
there
could
be
*NL*
nothing
done
satisfactory
to
you
.
There
were
persons
here
who
*NL*
were
willing
to
buy
you
and
run
the
risk
of
getting
you
.
To
this
*NL*
I
would
not
consent
.
I
have
always
been
attached
to
you
,
and
*NL*
would
not
like
to
see
you
the
slave
of
another
,
or
have
unkind
*NL*
treatment
.
I
am
married
now
,
and
can
protect
you
.
My
husband
*NL*
expects
to
move
to
Virginia
this
spring
,
where
we
think
of
*NL*
settling
.
I
am
very
anxious
that
you
should
come
and
live
with
*NL*
me
.
If
you
are
not
willing
to
come
,
you
may
purchase
yourself
;
*NL*
but
I
should
prefer
having
you
live
with
me
.
If
you
come
,
you
*NL*
may
,
if
you
like
,
spend
a
month
with
your
grandmother
and
*NL*
friends
,
then
come
to
me
in
Norfolk
,
Virginia
.
Think
this
over
,
*NL*
and
write
as
soon
as
possible
,
and
let
me
know
the
conclusion
.
*NL*
Hoping
that
your
children
are
well
,
I
remain
your
friend
and
*NL*
mistress
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
I
did
not
write
to
return
thanks
for
this
cordial
invitation
.
I
*NL*
felt
insulted
to
be
thought
stupid
enough
to
be
caught
by
such
professions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
up
into
my
parlor
,
''
said
the
spider
to
the
fly
;
*NL*
``
Tis
the
prettiest
little
parlor
that
ever
you
did
spy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
plain
that
Dr.
Flint
's
family
were
apprised
of
my
movements
,
since
*NL*
they
knew
of
my
voyage
to
Europe
.
I
expected
to
have
further
trouble
from
*NL*
them
;
but
having
eluded
them
thus
far
,
I
hoped
to
be
as
successful
in
*NL*
future
.
The
money
I
had
earned
,
I
was
desirous
to
devote
to
the
education
*NL*
of
my
children
,
and
to
secure
a
home
for
them
.
It
seemed
not
only
hard
,
but
*NL*
unjust
,
to
pay
for
myself
.
I
could
not
possibly
regard
myself
as
a
piece
of
*NL*
property
.
Moreover
,
I
had
worked
many
years
without
wages
,
and
during
that
*NL*
time
had
been
obliged
to
depend
on
my
grandmother
for
many
comforts
in
food
*NL*
and
clothing
.
My
children
certainly
belonged
to
me
;
but
though
Dr.
Flint
*NL*
had
incurred
no
expense
for
their
support
,
he
had
received
a
large
sum
of
*NL*
money
for
them
.
I
knew
the
law
would
decide
that
I
was
his
property
,
and
*NL*
would
probably
still
give
his
daughter
a
claim
to
my
children
;
but
I
*NL*
regarded
such
laws
as
the
regulations
of
robbers
,
who
had
no
rights
that
I
*NL*
was
bound
to
respect
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Fugitive
Slave
Law
had
not
then
passed
.
The
judges
of
Massachusetts
had
*NL*
not
then
stooped
under
chains
to
enter
her
courts
of
justice
,
so
called
.
I
*NL*
knew
my
old
master
was
rather
skittish
of
Massachusetts
.
I
relied
on
her
*NL*
love
of
freedom
,
and
felt
safe
on
her
soil
.
I
am
now
aware
that
I
honored
*NL*
the
old
Commonwealth
beyond
her
deserts
.

XXXIX
.
The
Confession
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
For
two
years
my
daughter
and
I
supported
ourselves
comfortably
in
Boston
.
*NL*
At
the
end
of
that
time
,
my
brother
William
offered
to
send
Ellen
to
a
*NL*
boarding
school
.
It
required
a
great
effort
for
me
to
consent
to
part
with
*NL*
her
,
for
I
had
few
near
ties
,
and
it
was
her
presence
that
made
my
two
*NL*
little
rooms
seem
home-like
.
But
my
judgment
prevailed
over
my
selfish
*NL*
feelings
.
I
made
preparations
for
her
departure
.
During
the
two
years
we
*NL*
had
lived
together
I
had
often
resolved
to
tell
her
something
about
her
*NL*
father
;
but
I
had
never
been
able
to
muster
sufficient
courage
.
I
had
a
*NL*
shrinking
dread
of
diminishing
my
child
's
love
.
I
knew
she
must
have
*NL*
curiosity
on
the
subject
,
but
she
had
never
asked
a
question
.
She
was
*NL*
always
very
careful
not
to
say
any
thing
to
remind
me
of
my
troubles
.
Now
*NL*
that
she
was
going
from
me
,
I
thought
if
I
should
die
before
she
returned
,
*NL*
she
might
hear
my
story
from
some
one
who
did
not
understand
the
palliating
*NL*
circumstances
;
and
that
if
she
were
entirely
ignorant
on
the
subject
,
her
*NL*
sensitive
nature
might
receive
a
rude
shock
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
retired
for
the
night
,
she
said
,
``
Mother
,
it
is
very
hard
to
leave
*NL*
you
alone
.
I
am
almost
sorry
I
am
going
,
though
I
do
want
to
improve
*NL*
myself
.
But
you
will
write
to
me
often
;
wo
n't
you
,
mother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
not
throw
my
arms
round
her
.
I
did
not
answer
her
.
But
in
a
calm
,
*NL*
solemn
way
,
for
it
cost
me
great
effort
,
I
said
,
``
Listen
to
me
,
Ellen
;
I
*NL*
have
something
to
tell
you
!
''
I
recounted
my
early
sufferings
in
slavery
,
*NL*
and
told
her
how
nearly
they
had
crushed
me
.
I
began
to
tell
her
how
they
*NL*
had
driven
me
into
a
great
sin
,
when
she
clasped
me
in
her
arms
,
and
*NL*
exclaimed
,
``
O
,
do
n't
,
mother
!
Please
do
n't
tell
me
any
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
,
``
But
,
my
child
,
I
want
you
to
know
about
your
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
all
about
it
,
mother
,
''
she
replied
;
``
I
am
nothing
to
my
father
,
and
*NL*
he
is
nothing
to
me
.
All
my
love
is
for
you
.
I
was
with
him
five
months
in
*NL*
Washington
,
and
he
never
cared
for
me
.
He
never
spoke
to
me
as
he
did
to
*NL*
his
little
Fanny
.
I
knew
all
the
time
he
was
my
father
,
for
Fanny
's
nurse
*NL*
told
me
so
,
but
she
said
I
must
never
tell
any
body
,
and
I
never
did
.
I
*NL*
used
to
wish
he
would
take
me
in
his
arms
and
kiss
me
,
as
he
did
Fanny
;
or
*NL*
that
he
would
sometimes
smile
at
me
,
as
he
did
at
her
.
I
thought
if
he
was
*NL*
my
own
father
,
he
ought
to
love
me
.
I
was
a
little
girl
then
,
and
did
n't
*NL*
know
any
better
.
But
now
I
never
think
any
thing
about
my
father
.
All
my
*NL*
love
is
for
you
.
''
She
hugged
me
closer
as
she
spoke
,
and
I
thanked
God
that
*NL*
the
knowledge
I
had
so
much
dreaded
to
impart
had
not
diminished
the
*NL*
affection
of
my
child
.
I
had
not
the
slightest
idea
she
knew
that
portion
*NL*
of
my
history
.
If
I
had
,
I
should
have
spoken
to
her
long
before
;
for
my
*NL*
pent-up
feelings
had
often
longed
to
pour
themselves
out
to
some
one
I
*NL*
could
trust
.
But
I
loved
the
dear
girl
better
for
the
delicacy
she
had
*NL*
manifested
towards
her
unfortunate
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
,
she
and
her
uncle
started
on
their
journey
to
the
village
*NL*
in
New
York
,
where
she
was
to
be
placed
at
school
.
It
seemed
as
if
all
the
*NL*
sunshine
had
gone
away
.
My
little
room
was
dreadfully
lonely
.
I
was
*NL*
thankful
when
a
message
came
from
a
lady
,
accustomed
to
employ
me
,
*NL*
requesting
me
to
come
and
sew
in
her
family
for
several
weeks
.
On
my
*NL*
return
,
I
found
a
letter
from
brother
William
.
He
thought
of
opening
an
*NL*
anti-slavery
reading
room
in
Rochester
,
and
combining
with
it
the
sale
of
*NL*
some
books
and
stationery
;
and
he
wanted
me
to
unite
with
him
.
We
tried
it
,
*NL*
but
it
was
not
successful
.
We
found
warm
anti-slavery
friends
there
,
but
*NL*
the
feeling
was
not
general
enough
to
support
such
an
establishment
.
I
*NL*
passed
nearly
a
year
in
the
family
of
Isaac
and
Amy
Post
,
practical
*NL*
believers
in
the
Christian
doctrine
of
human
brotherhood
.
They
measure
a
*NL*
man
's
worth
by
his
character
,
not
by
his
complexion
.
The
memory
of
those
*NL*
beloved
and
honored
friends
will
remain
with
me
to
my
latest
hour
.

The
Fugitive
Slave
Law
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
My
brother
,
being
disappointed
in
his
project
,
concluded
to
go
to
*NL*
California
;
and
it
was
agreed
that
Benjamin
should
go
with
him
.
Ellen
liked
*NL*
her
school
,
and
was
a
great
favorite
there
.
They
did
not
know
her
history
,
*NL*
and
she
did
not
tell
it
,
because
she
had
no
desire
to
make
capital
out
of
*NL*
their
sympathy
.
But
when
it
was
accidentally
discovered
that
her
mother
was
*NL*
a
fugitive
slave
,
every
method
was
used
to
increase
her
advantages
and
*NL*
diminish
her
expenses
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
alone
again
.
It
was
necessary
for
me
to
be
earning
money
,
and
I
*NL*
preferred
that
it
should
be
among
those
who
knew
me
.
On
my
return
from
*NL*
Rochester
,
I
called
at
the
house
of
Mr.
Bruce
,
to
see
Mary
,
the
darling
*NL*
little
babe
that
had
thawed
my
heart
,
when
it
was
freezing
into
a
cheerless
*NL*
distrust
of
all
my
fellow-beings
.
She
was
growing
a
tall
girl
now
,
but
I
*NL*
loved
her
always
.
Mr.
Bruce
had
married
again
,
and
it
was
proposed
that
I
*NL*
should
become
nurse
to
a
new
infant
.
I
had
but
one
hesitation
,
and
that
was
*NL*
feeling
of
insecurity
in
New
York
,
now
greatly
increased
by
the
passage
of
*NL*
the
Fugitive
Slave
Law
.
However
,
I
resolved
to
try
the
experiment
.
I
was
*NL*
again
fortunate
in
my
employer
.
The
new
Mrs.
Bruce
was
an
American
,
brought
*NL*
up
under
aristocratic
influences
,
and
still
living
in
the
midst
of
them
;
*NL*
but
if
she
had
any
prejudice
against
color
,
I
was
never
made
aware
of
it
;
*NL*
and
as
for
the
system
of
slavery
,
she
had
a
most
hearty
dislike
of
it
.
No
*NL*
sophistry
of
Southerners
could
blind
her
to
its
enormity
.
She
was
a
person
*NL*
of
excellent
principles
and
a
noble
heart
.
To
me
,
from
that
hour
to
the
*NL*
present
,
she
has
been
a
true
and
sympathizing
friend
.
Blessings
be
with
her
*NL*
and
hers
!
*NL*
*NL*
About
the
time
that
I
reentered
the
Bruce
family
,
an
event
occurred
of
*NL*
disastrous
import
to
the
colored
people
.
The
slave
Hamlin
,
the
first
*NL*
fugitive
that
came
under
the
new
law
,
was
given
up
by
the
bloodhounds
of
*NL*
the
north
to
the
bloodhounds
of
the
south
.
It
was
the
beginning
of
a
reign
*NL*
of
terror
to
the
colored
population
.
The
great
city
rushed
on
in
its
whirl
*NL*
of
excitement
,
taking
no
note
of
the
``
short
and
simple
annals
of
the
poor
.
''
*NL*
But
while
fashionables
were
listening
to
the
thrilling
voice
of
Jenny
Lind
*NL*
in
Metropolitan
Hall
,
the
thrilling
voices
of
poor
hunted
colored
people
*NL*
went
up
,
in
an
agony
of
supplication
,
to
the
Lord
,
from
Zion
's
church
.
Many
*NL*
families
,
who
had
lived
in
the
city
for
twenty
years
,
fled
from
it
now
.
*NL*
Many
a
poor
washerwoman
,
who
,
by
hard
labor
,
had
made
herself
a
comfortable
*NL*
home
,
was
obliged
to
sacrifice
her
furniture
,
bid
a
hurried
farewell
to
*NL*
friends
,
and
seek
her
fortune
among
strangers
in
Canada
.
Many
a
wife
*NL*
discovered
a
secret
she
had
never
known
before
--
that
her
husband
was
a
*NL*
fugitive
,
and
must
leave
her
to
insure
his
own
safety
.
Worse
still
,
many
a
*NL*
husband
discovered
that
his
wife
had
fled
from
slavery
years
ago
,
and
as
*NL*
``
the
child
follows
the
condition
of
its
mother
,
''
the
children
of
his
love
*NL*
were
liable
to
be
seized
and
carried
into
slavery
.
Every
where
,
in
those
*NL*
humble
homes
,
there
was
consternation
and
anguish
.
But
what
cared
the
*NL*
legislators
of
the
``
dominant
race
''
for
the
blood
they
were
crushing
out
of
*NL*
trampled
hearts
?
*NL*
*NL*
When
my
brother
William
spent
his
last
evening
with
me
,
before
he
went
to
*NL*
California
,
we
talked
nearly
all
the
time
of
the
distress
brought
on
our
*NL*
oppressed
people
by
the
passage
of
this
iniquitous
law
;
and
never
had
I
*NL*
seen
him
manifest
such
bitterness
of
spirit
,
such
stern
hostility
to
our
*NL*
oppressors
.
He
was
himself
free
from
the
operation
of
the
law
;
for
he
did
*NL*
not
run
from
any
Slaveholding
State
,
being
brought
into
the
Free
States
by
*NL*
his
master
.
But
I
was
subject
to
it
;
and
so
were
hundreds
of
intelligent
*NL*
and
industrious
people
all
around
us
.
I
seldom
ventured
into
the
streets
;
*NL*
and
when
it
was
necessary
to
do
an
errand
for
Mrs.
Bruce
,
or
any
of
the
*NL*
family
,
I
went
as
much
as
possible
through
back
streets
and
by-ways
.
What
a
*NL*
disgrace
to
a
city
calling
itself
free
,
that
inhabitants
,
guiltless
of
*NL*
offence
,
and
seeking
to
perform
their
duties
conscientiously
,
should
be
*NL*
condemned
to
live
in
such
incessant
fear
,
and
have
nowhere
to
turn
for
*NL*
protection
!
This
state
of
things
,
of
course
,
gave
rise
to
many
impromptu
*NL*
vigilance
committees
.
Every
colored
person
,
and
every
friend
of
their
*NL*
persecuted
race
,
kept
their
eyes
wide
open
.
Every
evening
I
examined
the
*NL*
newspapers
carefully
,
to
see
what
Southerners
had
put
up
at
the
hotels
.
I
*NL*
did
this
for
my
own
sake
,
thinking
my
young
mistress
and
her
husband
might
*NL*
be
among
the
list
;
I
wished
also
to
give
information
to
others
,
if
*NL*
necessary
;
for
if
many
were
``
running
to
and
fro
,
''
I
resolved
that
*NL*
``
knowledge
should
be
increased
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
brings
up
one
of
my
Southern
reminiscences
,
which
I
will
here
briefly
*NL*
relate
.
I
was
somewhat
acquainted
with
a
slave
named
Luke
,
who
belonged
to
*NL*
a
wealthy
man
in
our
vicinity
.
His
master
died
,
leaving
a
son
and
daughter
*NL*
heirs
to
his
large
fortune
.
In
the
division
of
the
slaves
,
Luke
was
*NL*
included
in
the
son
's
portion
.
This
young
man
became
a
prey
to
the
vices
he
*NL*
went
to
the
north
,
to
complete
his
education
,
he
carried
his
vices
with
*NL*
him
.
He
was
brought
home
,
deprived
of
the
use
of
his
limbs
,
by
excessive
*NL*
dissipation
.
Luke
was
appointed
to
wait
upon
his
bed-ridden
master
,
whose
*NL*
despotic
habits
were
greatly
increased
by
exasperation
at
his
own
*NL*
helplessness
.
He
kept
a
cowhide
beside
him
,
and
,
for
the
most
trivial
*NL*
occurrence
,
he
would
order
his
attendant
to
bare
his
back
,
and
kneel
beside
*NL*
the
couch
,
while
he
whipped
him
till
his
strength
was
exhausted
.
Some
days
*NL*
he
was
not
allowed
to
wear
any
thing
but
his
shirt
,
in
order
to
be
in
*NL*
readiness
to
be
flogged
.
A
day
seldom
passed
without
his
receiving
more
or
*NL*
less
blows
.
If
the
slightest
resistance
was
offered
,
the
town
constable
was
*NL*
sent
for
to
execute
the
punishment
,
and
Luke
learned
from
experience
how
*NL*
much
more
the
constable
's
strong
arm
was
to
be
dreaded
than
the
*NL*
comparatively
feeble
one
of
his
master
.
The
arm
of
his
tyrant
grew
weaker
,
*NL*
and
was
finally
palsied
;
and
then
the
constable
's
services
were
in
constant
*NL*
requisition
.
The
fact
that
he
was
entirely
dependent
on
Luke
's
care
,
and
*NL*
was
obliged
to
be
tended
like
an
infant
,
instead
of
inspiring
any
gratitude
*NL*
or
compassion
towards
his
poor
slave
,
seemed
only
to
increase
his
*NL*
irritability
and
cruelty
.
As
he
lay
there
on
his
bed
,
a
mere
degraded
wreck
*NL*
of
manhood
,
he
took
into
his
head
the
strangest
freaks
of
despotism
;
and
if
*NL*
Luke
hesitated
to
submit
to
his
orders
,
the
constable
was
immediately
sent
*NL*
for
.
Some
of
these
freaks
were
of
a
nature
too
filthy
to
be
repeated
.
When
*NL*
I
fled
from
the
house
of
bondage
,
I
left
poor
Luke
still
chained
to
the
*NL*
bedside
of
this
cruel
and
disgusting
wretch
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
when
I
had
been
requested
to
do
an
errand
for
Mrs.
Bruce
,
I
was
*NL*
hurrying
through
back
streets
,
as
usual
,
when
I
saw
a
young
man
*NL*
approaching
,
whose
face
was
familiar
to
me
.
As
he
came
nearer
,
I
recognized
*NL*
Luke
.
I
always
rejoiced
to
see
or
hear
of
any
one
who
had
escaped
from
the
*NL*
black
pit
;
I
was
peculiarly
glad
to
see
him
on
Northern
soil
,
though
I
no
*NL*
longer
called
it
_
free
_
soil
.
I
well
remembered
what
a
desolate
feeling
it
*NL*
was
to
be
alone
among
strangers
,
and
I
went
up
to
him
and
greeted
him
*NL*
cordially
.
At
first
,
he
did
not
know
me
;
but
when
I
mentioned
my
name
,
he
*NL*
remembered
all
about
me
.
I
told
him
of
the
Fugitive
Slave
Law
,
and
asked
*NL*
him
if
he
did
not
know
that
New
York
was
a
city
of
kidnappers
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
replied
,
``
De
risk
ai
n't
so
bad
for
me
,
as
't
is
fur
you
.
'Cause
I
runned
*NL*
away
from
de
speculator
,
and
you
runned
away
from

Dem
speculators
*NL*

come
here
fur
a

if

An
I
tell
you
I

I
had
*NL*
too
hard
times
down
dar
,
to
let
'em

nigger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
then
told
me
of
the
advice
he
had
received
,
and
the
plans
he
had
laid
.
I
*NL*
asked
if
he
had
money
enough
to
take
him
to
Canada
.
''
`
Pend

it
,
I

''
*NL*
he
replied
.
``
I

So
I

With
a
*NL*
low
,
chuckling
laugh
,
he
added
,
``

n't

but
he

''
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
a
fair
specimen
of
how
the
moral
sense
is
educated
by
slavery
.
When
*NL*
a
man
has
his
wages
stolen
from
him
,
year
after
year
,
and
the
laws
sanction
*NL*
and
enforce
the
theft
,
how
can
he
be
expected
to
have
more
regard
to
*NL*
honesty
than
has
the
man
who
robs
him
?
I
have
become
somewhat
enlightened
,
*NL*
but
I
confess
that
I
agree
with
poor
,
ignorant
,
much-abused
Luke
,
in
*NL*
thinking
he
had
a
_
right
_
to
that
money
,
as
a
portion
of
his
unpaid
wages
.
*NL*
He
went
to
Canada
forthwith
,
and
I
have
not
since
heard
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
that
winter
I
lived
in
a
state
of
anxiety
.
When
I
took
the
children
out
*NL*
to
breathe
the
air
,
I
closely
observed
the
countenances
of
all
I
met
.
I
*NL*
dreaded
the
approach
of
summer
,
when
snakes
and
slaveholders
make
their
*NL*
appearance
.
I
was
,
in
fact
,
a
slave
in
New
York
,
as
subject
to
slave
laws
*NL*
as
I
had
been
in
a
Slave
State
.
Strange
incongruity
in
a
State
called
free
!
*NL*
*NL*
Spring
returned
,
and
I
received
warning
from
the
south
that
Dr.
Flint
knew
*NL*
of
my
return
to
my
old
place
,
and
was
making
preparations
to
have
me
*NL*
caught
.
I
learned
afterwards
that
my
dress
,
and
that
of
Mrs.
Bruce
's
*NL*
children
,
had
been
described
to
him
by
some
of
the
Northern
tools
,
which
*NL*
slaveholders
employ
for
their
base
purposes
,
and
then
indulge
in
sneers
at
*NL*
their
cupidity
and
mean
servility
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
immediately
informed
Mrs.
Bruce
of
my
danger
,
and
she
took
prompt
*NL*
measures
for
my
safety
.
My
place
as
nurse
could
not
be
supplied
*NL*
immediately
,
and
this
generous
,
sympathizing
lady
proposed
that
I
should
*NL*
carry
her
baby
away
.
It
was
a
comfort
to
me
to
have
the
child
with
me
;
for
*NL*
the
heart
is
reluctant
to
be
torn
away
from
every
object
it
loves
.
But
how
*NL*
few
mothers
would
have
consented
to
have
one
of
their
own
babes
become
a
*NL*
fugitive
,
for
the
sake
of
a
poor
,
hunted
nurse
,
on
whom
the
legislators
of
*NL*
the
country
had
let
loose
the
bloodhounds
!
When
I
spoke
of
the
sacrifice
*NL*
she
was
making
,
in
depriving
herself
of
her
dear
baby
,
she
replied
,
``
It
is
*NL*
better
for
you
to
have
baby
with
you
,
Linda
;
for
if
they
get
on
your
track
,
*NL*
they
will
be
obliged
to
bring
the
child
to
me
;
and
then
,
if
there
is
a
*NL*
possibility
of
saving
you
,
you
shall
be
saved
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
lady
had
a
very
wealthy
relative
,
a
benevolent
gentleman
in
many
*NL*
respects
,
but
aristocratic
and
pro-slavery
.
He
remonstrated
with
her
for
*NL*
harboring
a
fugitive
slave
;
told
her
she
was
violating
the
laws
of
her
*NL*
country
;
and
asked
her
if
she
was
aware
of
the
penalty
.
She
replied
,
``
I
am
*NL*
very
well
aware
of
it
.
It
is
imprisonment
and
one
thousand
dollars
fine
.
*NL*
Shame
on
my
country
that
it
_
is
_
so
!
I
am
ready
to
incur
the
penalty
.
I
*NL*
will
go
to
the
state
's
prison
,
rather
than
have
any
poor
victim
torn
from
*NL*
_
my
_
house
,
to
be
carried
back
to
slavery
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
noble
heart
!
The
brave
heart
!
The
tears
are
in
my
eyes
while
I
write
of
*NL*
her
.
May
the
God
of
the
helpless
reward
her
for
her
sympathy
with
my
*NL*
persecuted
people
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
sent
into
New
England
,
where
I
was
sheltered
by
the
wife
of
a
*NL*
senator
,
whom
I
shall
always
hold
in
grateful
remembrance
.
This
honorable
*NL*
gentleman
would
not
have
voted
for
the
Fugitive
Slave
Law
,
as
did
the
*NL*
senator
in
``
Uncle
Tom
's
Cabin
;
''
on
the
contrary
,
he
was
strongly
opposed
to
*NL*
it
;
but
he
was
enough
under
its
influence
to
be
afraid
of
having
me
remain
*NL*
in
his
house
many
hours
.
So
I
was
sent
into
the
country
,
where
I
remained
a
*NL*
month
with
the
baby
.
When
it
was
supposed
that
Dr.
Flint
's
emissaries
had
*NL*
lost
track
of
me
,
and
given
up
the
pursuit
for
the
present
,
I
returned
to
*NL*
New
York
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XLI
.
Free
At
Last
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bruce
,
and
every
member
of
her
family
,
were
exceedingly
kind
to
me
.
I
*NL*
was
thankful
for
the
blessings
of
my
lot
,
yet
I
could
not
always
wear
a
*NL*
cheerful
countenance
.
I
was
doing
harm
to
no
one
;
on
the
contrary
,
I
was
*NL*
doing
all
the
good
I
could
in
my
small
way
;
yet
I
could
never
go
out
to
*NL*
breathe
God
's
free
air
without
trepidation
at
my
heart
.
This
seemed
hard
;
*NL*
and
I
could
not
think
it
was
a
right
state
of
things
in
any
civilized
*NL*
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
time
to
time
I
received
news
from
my
good
old
grandmother
.
She
could
*NL*
not
write
;
but
she
employed
others
to
write
for
her
.
The
following
is
an
*NL*
extract
from
one
of
her
last
letters
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
Dear
Daughter
:
I
can
not
hope
to
see
you
again
on
earth
;
but
I
*NL*
pray
to
God
to
unite
us
above
,
where
pain
will
no
more
rack
this
*NL*
feeble
body
of
mine
;
where
sorrow
and
parting
from
my
children
*NL*
will
be
no
more
.
God
has
promised
these
things
if
we
are
faithful
*NL*
unto
the
end
.
My
age
and
feeble
health
deprive
me
of
going
to
*NL*
church
now
;
but
God
is
with
me
here
at
home
.
Thank
your
brother
*NL*
for
his
kindness
.
Give
much
love
to
him
,
and
tell
him
to
remember
*NL*
the
Creator
in
the
days
of
his
youth
,
and
strive
to
meet
me
in
*NL*
the
Father
's
kingdom
.
Love
to
Ellen
and
Benjamin
.
Do
n't
neglect
*NL*
him
.
Tell
him
for
me
,
to
be
a
good
boy
.
Strive
,
my
child
,
to
*NL*
train
them
for
God
's
children
.
May
he
protect
and
provide
for
*NL*
you
,
is
the
prayer
of
your
loving
old
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
letters
both
cheered
and
saddened
me
.
I
was
always
glad
to
have
*NL*
tidings
from
the
kind
,
faithful
old
friend
of
my
unhappy
youth
;
but
her
*NL*
messages
of
love
made
my
heart
yearn
to
see
her
before
she
died
,
and
I
*NL*
mourned
over
the
fact
that
it
was
impossible
.
Some
months
after
I
returned
*NL*
from
my
flight
to
New
England
,
I
received
a
letter
from
her
,
in
which
she
*NL*
wrote
,
``
Dr.
Flint
is
dead
.
He
has
left
a
distressed
family
.
Poor
old
man
!
I
*NL*
hope
he
made
his
peace
with
God
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
remembered
how
he
had
defrauded
my
grandmother
of
the
hard
earnings
she
*NL*
had
loaned
;
how
he
had
tried
to
cheat
her
out
of
the
freedom
her
mistress
*NL*
had
promised
her
,
and
how
he
had
persecuted
her
children
;
and
I
thought
to
*NL*
myself
that
she
was
a
better
Christian
than
I
was
,
if
she
could
entirely
*NL*
forgive
him
.
I
can
not
say
,
with
truth
,
that
the
news
of
my
old
master
's
*NL*
death
softened
my
feelings
towards
him
.
There
are
wrongs
which
even
the
*NL*
grave
does
not
bury
.
The
man
was
odious
to
me
while
he
lived
,
and
his
*NL*
memory
is
odious
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
departure
from
this
world
did
not
diminish
my
danger
.
He
had
threatened
*NL*
my
grandmother
that
his
heirs
should
hold
me
in
slavery
after
he
was
gone
;
*NL*
that
I
never
should
be
free
so
long
as
a
child
of
his
survived
.
As
for
Mrs.
*NL*
Flint
,
I
had
seen
her
in
deeper
afflictions
than
I
supposed
the
loss
of
her
*NL*
husband
would
be
,
for
she
had
buried
several
children
;
yet
I
never
saw
any
*NL*
signs
of
softening
in
her
heart
.
The
doctor
had
died
in
embarrassed
*NL*
circumstances
,
and
had
little
to
will
to
his
heirs
,
except
such
property
as
*NL*
he
was
unable
to
grasp
.
I
was
well
aware
what
I
had
to
expect
from
the
*NL*
family
of
Flints
;
and
my
fears
were
confirmed
by
a
letter
from
the
south
,
*NL*
warning
me
to
be
on
my
guard
,
because
Mrs.
Flint
openly
declared
that
her
*NL*
daughter
could
not
afford
to
lose
so
valuable
a
slave
as
I
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
kept
close
watch
of
the
newspapers
for
arrivals
;
but
one
Saturday
night
,
*NL*
being
much
occupied
,
I
forgot
to
examine
the
Evening
Express
as
usual
.
I
*NL*
went
down
into
the
parlor
for
it
,
early
in
the
morning
,
and
found
the
boy
*NL*
about
to
kindle
a
fire
with
it
.
I
took
it
from
him
and
examined
the
list
of
*NL*
arrivals
.
Reader
,
if
you
have
never
been
a
slave
,
you
can
not
imagine
the
*NL*
acute
sensation
of
suffering
at
my
heart
,
when
I
read
the
names
of
Mr.
and
*NL*
Mrs.
Dodge
,
at
a
hotel
in
Courtland
Street
.
It
was
a
third-rate
hotel
,
and
*NL*
that
circumstance
convinced
me
of
the
truth
of
what
I
had
heard
,
that
they
*NL*
were
short
of
funds
and
had
need
of
my
value
,
as
_
they
_
valued
me
;
and
that
*NL*
was
by
dollars
and
cents
.
I
hastened
with
the
paper
to
Mrs.
Bruce
.
Her
*NL*
heart
and
hand
were
always
open
to
every
one
in
distress
,
and
she
always
*NL*
warmly
sympathized
with
mine
.
It
was
impossible
to
tell
how
near
the
enemy
*NL*
was
.
He
might
have
passed
and
repassed
the
house
while
we
were
sleeping
.
He
*NL*
might
at
that
moment
be
waiting
to
pounce
upon
me
if
I
ventured
out
of
*NL*
doors
.
I
had
never
seen
the
husband
of
my
young
mistress
,
and
therefore
I
*NL*
could
not
distinguish
him
from
any
other
stranger
.
A
carriage
was
hastily
*NL*
ordered
;
and
,
closely
veiled
,
I
followed
Mrs.
Bruce
,
taking
the
baby
again
*NL*
with
me
into
exile
.
After
various
turnings
and
crossings
,
and
returnings
,
*NL*
the
carriage
stopped
at
the
house
of
one
of
Mrs.
Bruce
's
friends
,
where
I
*NL*
was
kindly
received
.
Mrs.
Bruce
returned
immediately
,
to
instruct
the
*NL*
domestics
what
to
say
if
any
one
came
to
inquire
for
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
lucky
for
me
that
the
evening
paper
was
not
burned
up
before
I
had
a
*NL*
chance
to
examine
the
list
of
arrivals
.
It
was
not
long
after
Mrs.
Bruce
's
*NL*
return
to
her
house
,
before
several
people
came
to
inquire
for
me
.
One
*NL*
inquired
for
me
,
another
asked
for
my
daughter
Ellen
,
and
another
said
he
*NL*
had
a
letter
from
my
grandmother
,
which
he
was
requested
to
deliver
in
*NL*
person
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
told
,
``
She
_
has
_
lived
here
,
but
she
has
left
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
long
ago
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
where
she
went
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
,
sir
.
''
And
the
door
was
closed
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
Mr.
Dodge
,
who
claimed
me
as
his
property
,
was
originally
a
Yankee
*NL*
pedler
in
the
south
;
then
he
became
a
merchant
,
and
finally
a
slaveholder
.
*NL*
He
managed
to
get
introduced
into
what
was
called
the
first
society
,
and
*NL*
married
Miss
Emily
Flint
.
A
quarrel
arose
between
him
and
her
brother
,
and
*NL*
the
brother
cowhided
him
.
This
led
to
a
family
feud
,
and
he
proposed
to
*NL*
remove
to
Virginia
.
Dr.
Flint
left
him
no
property
,
and
his
own
means
had
*NL*
become
circumscribed
,
while
a
wife
and
children
depended
upon
him
for
*NL*
support
.
Under
these
circumstances
,
it
was
very
natural
that
he
should
make
*NL*
an
effort
to
put
me
into
his
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
a
colored
friend
,
a
man
from
my
native
place
,
in
whom
I
had
the
most
*NL*
implicit
confidence
.
I
sent
for
him
,
and
told
him
that
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Dodge
*NL*
had
arrived
in
New
York
.
I
proposed
that
he
should
call
upon
them
to
make
*NL*
inquiries
about
his
friends
at
the
south
,
with
whom
Dr.
Flint
's
family
were
*NL*
well
acquainted
.
He
thought
there
was
no
impropriety
in
his
doing
so
,
and
*NL*
he
consented
.
He
went
to
the
hotel
,
and
knocked
at
the
door
of
Mr.
Dodge
's
*NL*
room
,
which
was
opened
by
the
gentleman
himself
,
who
gruffly
inquired
,
*NL*
``
What
brought
you
here
?
How
came
you
to
know
I
was
in
the
city
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
arrival
was
published
in
the
evening
papers
,
sir
;
and
I
called
to
ask
*NL*
Mrs.
Dodge
about
my
friends
at
home
.
I
did
n't
suppose
it
would
give
any
*NL*
offence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
's
that
negro
girl
,
that
belongs
to
my
wife
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
girl
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
well
enough
.
I
mean
Linda
,
that
ran
away
from
Dr.
Flint
's
*NL*
plantation
,
some
years
ago
.
I
dare
say
you
've
seen
her
,
and
know
where
she
*NL*
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
I
've
seen
her
,
and
know
where
she
is
.
She
is
out
of
your
reach
,
*NL*
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
where
she
is
,
or
bring
her
to
me
,
and
I
will
give
her
a
chance
to
*NL*
buy
her
freedom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
it
would
be
of
any
use
,
sir
.
I
have
heard
her
say
she
would
*NL*
go
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
,
rather
than
pay
any
man
or
woman
for
her
*NL*
freedom
,
because
she
thinks
she
has
a
right
to
it
.
Besides
,
she
could
n't
do
*NL*
it
,
if
she
would
,
for
she
has
spent
her
earnings
to
educate
her
children
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
made
Mr.
Dodge
very
angry
,
and
some
high
words
passed
between
them
.
My
*NL*
friend
was
afraid
to
come
where
I
was
;
but
in
the
course
of
the
day
I
*NL*
received
a
note
from
him
.
I
supposed
they
had
not
come
from
the
south
,
in
*NL*
the
winter
,
for
a
pleasure
excursion
;
and
now
the
nature
of
their
business
*NL*
was
very
plain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bruce
came
to
me
and
entreated
me
to
leave
the
city
the
next
morning
.
*NL*
She
said
her
house
was
watched
,
and
it
was
possible
that
some
clew
to
me
*NL*
might
be
obtained
.
I
refused
to
take
her
advice
.
She
pleaded
with
an
*NL*
earnest
tenderness
,
that
ought
to
have
moved
me
;
but
I
was
in
a
bitter
,
*NL*
disheartened
mood
.
I
was
weary
of
flying
from
pillar
to
post
.
I
had
been
*NL*
chased
during
half
my
life
,
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
chase
was
never
to
end
.
*NL*
There
I
sat
,
in
that
great
city
,
guiltless
of
crime
,
yet
not
daring
to
*NL*
worship
God
in
any
of
the
churches
.
I
heard
the
bells
ringing
for
afternoon
*NL*
service
,
and
,
with
contemptuous
sarcasm
,
I
said
,
``
Will
the
preachers
take
*NL*
for
their
text
,
`
Proclaim
liberty
to
the
captive
,
and
the
opening
of
prison
*NL*
doors
to
them
that
are
bound
'
?
or
will
they
preach
from
the
text
,
`
Do
unto
*NL*
others
as
ye
would
they
should
do
unto
you
'
?
''
Oppressed
Poles
and
*NL*
Hungarians
could
find
a
safe
refuge
in
that
city
;
John
Mitchell
was
free
to
*NL*
proclaim
in
the
City
Hall
his
desire
for
``
a
plantation
well
stocked
with
*NL*
slaves
;
''
but
there
I
sat
,
an
oppressed
American
,
not
daring
to
show
my
*NL*
face
.
God
forgive
the
black
and
bitter
thoughts
I
indulged
on
that
Sabbath
*NL*
day
!
The
Scripture
says
,
``
Oppression
makes
even
a
wise
man
mad
;
''
and
I
was
*NL*
not
wise
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
been
told
that
Mr.
Dodge
said
his
wife
had
never
signed
away
her
*NL*
right
to
my
children
,
and
if
he
could
not
get
me
,
he
would
take
them
.
This
*NL*
it
was
,
more
than
any
thing
else
,
that
roused
such
a
tempest
in
my
soul
.
*NL*
Benjamin
was
with
his
uncle
William
in
California
,
but
my
innocent
young
*NL*
daughter
had
come
to
spend
a
vacation
with
me
.
I
thought
of
what
I
had
*NL*
suffered
in
slavery
at
her
age
,
and
my
heart
was
like
a
tiger
's
when
a
*NL*
hunter
tries
to
seize
her
young
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dear
Mrs.
Bruce
!
I
seem
to
see
the
expression
of
her
face
,
as
she
turned
*NL*
away
discouraged
by
my
obstinate
mood
.
Finding
her
expostulations
*NL*
unavailing
,
she
sent
Ellen
to
entreat
me
.
When
ten
o'clock
in
the
evening
*NL*
arrived
and
Ellen
had
not
returned
,
this
watchful
and
unwearied
friend
*NL*
became
anxious
.
She
came
to
us
in
a
carriage
,
bringing
a
well-filled
trunk
*NL*
for
my
journey
--
trusting
that
by
this
time
I
would
listen
to
reason
.
I
*NL*
yielded
to
her
,
as
I
ought
to
have
done
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
,
baby
and
I
set
out
in
a
heavy
snow
storm
,
bound
for
New
*NL*
England
again
.
I
received
letters
from
the
City
of
Iniquity
,
addressed
to
*NL*
me
under
an
assumed
name
.
In
a
few
days
one
came
from
Mrs.
Bruce
,
informing
*NL*
me
that
my
new
master
was
still
searching
for
me
,
and
that
she
intended
to
*NL*
put
an
end
to
this
persecution
by
buying
my
freedom
.
I
felt
grateful
for
*NL*
the
kindness
that
prompted
this
offer
,
but
the
idea
was
not
so
pleasant
to
*NL*
me
as
might
have
been
expected
.
The
more
my
mind
had
become
enlightened
,
*NL*
the
more
difficult
it
was
for
me
to
consider
myself
an
article
of
property
;
*NL*
and
to
pay
money
to
those
who
had
so
grievously
oppressed
me
seemed
like
*NL*
taking
from
my
sufferings
the
glory
of
triumph
.
I
wrote
to
Mrs.
Bruce
,
*NL*
thanking
her
,
but
saying
that
being
sold
from
one
owner
to
another
seemed
*NL*
too
much
like
slavery
;
that
such
a
great
obligation
could
not
be
easily
*NL*
cancelled
;
and
that
I
preferred
to
go
to
my
brother
in
California
.
*NL*
*NL*
Without
my
knowledge
,
Mrs.
Bruce
employed
a
gentleman
in
New
York
to
enter
*NL*
into
negotiations
with
Mr.
Dodge
.
He
proposed
to
pay
three
hundred
dollars
*NL*
down
,
if
Mr.
Dodge
would
sell
me
,
and
enter
into
obligations
to
relinquish
*NL*
all
claim
to
me
or
my
children
forever
after
.
He
who
called
himself
my
*NL*
master
said
he
scorned
so
small
an
offer
for
such
a
valuable
servant
.
The
*NL*
gentleman
replied
,
``
You
can
do
as
you
choose
,
sir
.
If
you
reject
this
offer
*NL*
you
will
never
get
any
thing
;
for
the
woman
has
friends
who
will
convey
her
*NL*
and
her
children
out
of
the
country
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Dodge
concluded
that
``
half
a
loaf
was
better
than
no
bread
,
''
and
he
*NL*
agreed
to
the
proffered
terms
.
By
the
next
mail
I
received
this
brief
*NL*
letter
from
Mrs.
Bruce
:
``
I
am
rejoiced
to
tell
you
that
the
money
for
your
*NL*
freedom
has
been
paid
to
Mr.
Dodge
.
Come
home
to-morrow
.
I
long
to
see
you
*NL*
and
my
sweet
babe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
brain
reeled
as
I
read
these
lines
.
A
gentleman
near
me
said
,
``
It
's
*NL*
true
;
I
have
seen
the
bill
of
sale
.
''
``
The
bill
of
sale
!
''
Those
words
struck
*NL*
me
like
a
blow
.
So
I
was
_
sold
_
at
last
!
A
human
being
_
sold
_
in
the
free
*NL*
city
of
New
York
!
The
bill
of
sale
is
on
record
,
and
future
generations
*NL*
will
learn
from
it
that
women
were
articles
of
traffic
in
New
York
,
late
in
*NL*
the
nineteenth
century
of
the
Christian
religion
.
It
may
hereafter
prove
a
*NL*
useful
document
to
antiquaries
,
who
are
seeking
to
measure
the
progress
of
*NL*
civilization
in
the
United
States
.
I
well
know
the
value
of
that
bit
of
*NL*
paper
;
but
much
as
I
love
freedom
,
I
do
not
like
to
look
upon
it
.
I
am
*NL*
deeply
grateful
to
the
generous
friend
who
procured
it
,
but
I
despise
the
*NL*
miscreant
who
demanded
payment
for
what
never
rightfully
belonged
to
him
or
*NL*
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
objected
to
having
my
freedom
bought
,
yet
I
must
confess
that
when
it
*NL*
was
done
I
felt
as
if
a
heavy
load
had
been
lifted
from
my
weary
shoulders
.
*NL*
When
I
rode
home
in
the
cars
I
was
no
longer
afraid
to
unveil
my
face
and
*NL*
look
at
people
as
they
passed
.
I
should
have
been
glad
to
have
met
Daniel
*NL*
Dodge
himself
;
to
have
had
him
seen
me
and
known
me
,
that
he
might
have
*NL*
mourned
over
the
untoward
circumstances
which
compelled
him
to
sell
me
for
*NL*
three
hundred
dollars
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
reached
home
,
the
arms
of
my
benefactress
were
thrown
round
me
,
and
*NL*
our
tears
mingled
.
As
soon
as
she
could
speak
,
she
said
,
``
O
Linda
,
I
'm
_
so
_
*NL*
glad
it
's
all
over
!
You
wrote
to
me
as
if
you
thought
you
were
going
to
be
*NL*
transferred
from
one
owner
to
another
.
But
I
did
not
buy
you
for
your
*NL*
services
.
I
should
have
done
just
the
same
,
if
you
had
been
going
to
sail
*NL*
for
California
to-morrow
.
I
should
,
at
least
,
have
the
satisfaction
of
*NL*
knowing
that
you
left
me
a
free
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
heart
was
exceedingly
full
.
I
remembered
how
my
poor
father
had
tried
to
*NL*
buy
me
,
when
I
was
a
small
child
,
and
how
he
had
been
disappointed
.
I
hoped
*NL*
his
spirit
was
rejoicing
over
me
now
.
I
remembered
how
my
good
old
*NL*
grandmother
had
laid
up
her
earnings
to
purchase
me
in
later
years
,
and
how
*NL*
often
her
plans
had
been
frustrated
.
How
that
faithful
,
loving
old
heart
*NL*
would
leap
for
joy
,
if
she
could
look
on
me
and
my
children
now
that
we
*NL*
were
free
!
My
relatives
had
been
foiled
in
all
their
efforts
,
but
God
had
*NL*
raised
me
up
a
friend
among
strangers
,
who
had
bestowed
on
me
the
precious
,
*NL*
long-desired
boon
.
Friend
!
It
is
a
common
word
,
often
lightly
used
.
Like
*NL*
other
good
and
beautiful
things
,
it
may
be
tarnished
by
careless
handling
;
*NL*
but
when
I
speak
of
Mrs.
Bruce
as
my
friend
,
the
word
is
sacred
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
grandmother
lived
to
rejoice
in
my
freedom
;
but
not
long
after
,
a
letter
*NL*
came
with
a
black
seal
.
She
had
gone
``
where
the
wicked
cease
from
*NL*
troubling
,
and
the
weary
are
at
rest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Time
passed
on
,
and
a
paper
came
to
me
from
the
south
,
containing
an
*NL*
obituary
notice
of
my
uncle
Phillip
.
It
was
the
only
case
I
ever
knew
of
*NL*
such
an
honor
conferred
upon
a
colored
person
.
It
was
written
by
one
of
his
*NL*
friends
,
and
contained
these
words
:
``
Now
that
death
has
laid
him
low
,
they
*NL*
call
him
a
good
man
and
a
useful
citizen
;
but
what
are
eulogies
to
the
*NL*
black
man
,
when
the
world
has
faded
from
his
vision
?
It
does
not
require
*NL*
man
's
praise
to
obtain
rest
in
God
's
kingdom
.
''
So
they
called
a
colored
man
*NL*
a
_
citizen
_
!
Strange
words
to
be
uttered
in
that
region
!
*NL*
*NL*
Reader
,
my
story
ends
with
freedom
;
not
in
the
usual
way
,
with
marriage
.
I
*NL*
and
my
children
are
now
free
!
We
are
as
free
from
the
power
of
slaveholders
*NL*
as
are
the
white
people
of
the
north
;
and
though
that
,
according
to
my
*NL*
ideas
,
is
not
saying
a
great
deal
,
it
is
a
vast
improvement
in
_
my
_
*NL*
condition
.
The
dream
of
my
life
is
not
yet
realized
.
I
do
not
sit
with
my
*NL*
children
in
a
home
of
my
own
,
I
still
long
for
a
hearthstone
of
my
own
,
*NL*
however
humble
.
I
wish
it
for
my
children
's
sake
far
more
than
for
my
own
.
*NL*
But
God
so
orders
circumstances
as
to
keep
me
with
my
friend
Mrs.
Bruce
.
*NL*
Love
,
duty
,
gratitude
,
also
bind
me
to
her
side
.
It
is
a
privilege
to
serve
*NL*
her
who
pities
my
oppressed
people
,
and
who
has
bestowed
the
inestimable
*NL*
boon
of
freedom
on
me
and
my
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
has
been
painful
to
me
,
in
many
ways
,
to
recall
the
dreary
years
I
*NL*
passed
in
bondage
.
I
would
gladly
forget
them
if
I
could
.
Yet
the
*NL*
retrospection
is
not
altogether
without
solace
;
for
with
those
gloomy
*NL*
recollections
come
tender
memories
of
my
good
old
grandmother
,
like
light
,
*NL*
fleecy
clouds
floating
over
a
dark
and
troubled
sea
.

APPENDIX

The
following
statement
is
from
Amy
Post
,
a
member
of
the
Society
of
*NL*
Friends
in
the
State
of
New
York
,
well
known
and
highly
respected
by
*NL*
friends
of
the
poor
and
the
oppressed
.
As
has
been
already
stated
,
in
the
*NL*
preceding
pages
,
the
author
of
this
volume
spent
some
time
under
her
*NL*
hospitable
roof
.
*NL*
*NL*
L.M.C.
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
author
of
this
book
is
my
highly-esteemed
friend
.
If
its
*NL*
readers
knew
her
as
I
know
her
,
they
could
not
fail
to
be
deeply
*NL*
interested
in
her
story
.
She
was
a
beloved
inmate
of
our
family
*NL*
nearly
the
whole
of
the
year
1849
.
She
was
introduced
to
us
by
*NL*
her
affectionate
and
conscientious
brother
,
who
had
previously
*NL*
related
to
us
some
of
the
almost
incredible
events
in
his
*NL*
sister
's
life
.
I
immediately
became
much
interested
in
Linda
;
for
*NL*
her
appearance
was
prepossessing
,
and
her
deportment
indicated
*NL*
remarkable
delicacy
of
feeling
and
purity
of
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
became
acquainted
,
she
related
to
me
,
from
time
to
time
*NL*
some
of
the
incidents
in
her
bitter
experiences
as
a
slave-woman
.
*NL*
Though
impelled
by
a
natural
craving
for
human
sympathy
,
she
*NL*
passed
through
a
baptism
of
suffering
,
even
in
recounting
her
*NL*
trials
to
me
,
in
private
confidential
conversations
.
The
burden
*NL*
of
these
memories
lay
heavily
upon
her
spirit
--
naturally
virtuous
*NL*
and
refined
.
I
repeatedly
urged
her
to
consent
to
the
publication
*NL*
of
her
narrative
;
for
I
felt
that
it
would
arouse
people
to
a
*NL*
more
earnest
work
for
the
disinthralment
of
millions
still
*NL*
remaining
in
that
soul-crushing
condition
,
which
was
so
*NL*
unendurable
to
her
.
But
her
sensitive
spirit
shrank
from
*NL*
publicity
.
She
said
,
``
You
know
a
woman
can
whisper
her
cruel
*NL*
wrongs
in
the
ear
of
a
dear
friend
much
easier
than
she
can
*NL*
record
them
for
the
world
to
read
.
''
Even
in
talking
with
me
,
she
*NL*
wept
so
much
,
and
seemed
to
suffer
such
mental
agony
,
that
I
felt
*NL*
her
story
was
too
sacred
to
be
drawn
from
her
by
inquisitive
*NL*
questions
,
and
I
left
her
free
to
tell
as
much
,
or
as
little
,
as
*NL*
she
chose
.
Still
,
I
urged
upon
her
the
duty
of
publishing
her
*NL*
experience
,
for
the
sake
of
the
good
it
might
do
;
and
,
at
last
,
*NL*
she
undertook
the
task
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
been
a
slave
so
large
a
portion
of
her
life
,
she
is
*NL*
unlearned
;
she
is
obliged
to
earn
her
living
by
her
own
labor
,
*NL*
and
she
has
worked
untiringly
to
procure
education
for
her
*NL*
children
;
several
times
she
has
been
obliged
to
leave
her
*NL*
employments
,
in
order
to
fly
from
the
man-hunters
and
*NL*
woman-hunters
of
our
land
;
but
she
pressed
through
all
these
*NL*
obstacles
and
overcame
them
.
After
the
labors
of
the
day
were
*NL*
over
,
she
traced
secretly
and
wearily
,
by
the
midnight
lamp
,
a
*NL*
truthful
record
of
her
eventful
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
Empire
State
is
a
shabby
place
of
refuge
for
the
oppressed
;
*NL*
but
here
,
through
anxiety
,
turmoil
,
and
despair
,
the
freedom
of
*NL*
Linda
and
her
children
was
finally
secured
,
by
the
exertions
of
a
*NL*
generous
friend
.
She
was
grateful
for
the
boon
;
but
the
idea
of
*NL*
having
been
_
bought
_
was
always
galling
to
a
spirit
that
could
*NL*
never
acknowledge
itself
to
be
a
chattel
.
She
wrote
to
us
thus
,
*NL*
soon
after
the
event
:
``
I
thank
you
for
your
kind
expressions
in
*NL*
regard
to
my
freedom
;
but
the
freedom
I
had
before
the
money
was
*NL*
paid
was
dearer
to
me
.
God
gave
me
_
that
_
freedom
;
but
man
put
*NL*
God
's
image
in
the
scales
with
the
paltry
sum
of
three
hundred
*NL*
dollars
.
I
served
for
my
liberty
as
faithfully
as
Jacob
served
*NL*
for
Rachel
.
At
the
end
,
he
had
large
possessions
;
but
I
was
*NL*
robbed
of
my
victory
;
I
was
obliged
to
resign
my
crown
,
to
rid
*NL*
myself
of
a
tyrant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
story
,
as
written
by
herself
,
can
not
fail
to
interest
the
*NL*
reader
.
It
is
a
sad
illustration
of
the
condition
of
this
*NL*
country
,
which
boasts
of
its
civilization
,
while
it
sanctions
*NL*
laws
and
customs
which
make
the
experiences
of
the
present
more
*NL*
strange
than
any
fictions
of
the
past
.

This
narrative
contains
some
incidents
so
extraordinary
,
that
,
*NL*
doubtless
,
many
persons
,
under
whose
eyes
it
may
chance
to
fall
,
*NL*
will
be
ready
to
believe
that
it
is
colored
highly
,
to
serve
a
*NL*
special
purpose
.
But
,
however
it
may
be
regarded
by
the
*NL*
incredulous
,
I
know
that
it
is
full
of
living
truths
.
I
have
been
*NL*
well
acquainted
with
the
author
from
my
boyhood
.
The
*NL*
circumstances
recounted
in
her
history
are
perfectly
familiar
to
*NL*
me
.
I
knew
of
her
treatment
from
her
master
;
of
the
imprisonment
*NL*
of
her
children
;
of
their
sale
and
redemption
;
of
her
seven
*NL*
years
'
concealment
;
and
of
her
subsequent
escape
to
the
North
.
I
*NL*
am
now
a
resident
of
Boston
,
and
am
a
living
witness
to
the
truth
*NL*
of
this
interesting
narrative
