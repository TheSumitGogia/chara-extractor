INTRODUCTION
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
confess
when
I
first
learned
that
Mrs.
Harper
was
about
to
write
``
a
*NL*
story
''
on
some
features
of
the
Anglo-African
race
,
growing
out
of
what
*NL*
was
once
popularly
known
as
the
``
peculiar
institution
,
''
I
had
my
doubts
*NL*
about
the
matter
.
Indeed
it
was
far
from
being
easy
for
me
to
think
that
*NL*
she
was
as
fortunate
as
she
might
have
been
in
selecting
a
subject
which
*NL*
would
afford
her
the
best
opportunity
for
bringing
out
a
work
of
merit
*NL*
and
lasting
worth
to
the
race
--
such
a
work
as
some
of
her
personal
*NL*
friends
have
long
desired
to
see
from
her
graphic
pen
.
However
,
after
*NL*
hearing
a
good
portion
of
the
manuscript
read
,
and
a
general
statement
*NL*
with
regard
to
the
object
in
view
,
I
admit
frankly
that
my
partial
*NL*
indifference
was
soon
swept
away
;
at
least
I
was
willing
to
wait
for
*NL*
further
developments
.
*NL*
*NL*
Being
very
desirous
that
one
of
the
race
,
so
long
distinguished
in
the
*NL*
cause
of
freedom
for
her
intellectual
worth
as
Mrs.
Harper
has
had
the
*NL*
honor
of
being
,
should
not
at
this
late
date
in
life
make
a
blunder
*NL*
which
might
detract
from
her
own
good
name
,
I
naturally
proposed
to
*NL*
await
developments
before
deciding
too
quickly
in
favor
of
giving
*NL*
encouragement
to
her
contemplated
effort
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
I
was
perfectly
aware
of
the
fact
that
she
had
much
material
in
*NL*
her
possession
for
a
most
interesting
book
on
the
subject
of
the
*NL*
condition
of
the
colored
people
in
the
South
.
I
know
of
no
other
woman
,
*NL*
white
or
colored
,
anywhere
,
who
has
come
so
intimately
in
contact
with
*NL*
the
colored
people
in
the
South
as
Mrs.
Harper
.
Since
emancipation
she
*NL*
has
labored
in
every
Southern
State
in
the
Union
,
save
two
,
Arkansas
and
*NL*
Texas
;
in
the
colleges
,
schools
,
churches
,
and
the
cabins
not
excepted
,
*NL*
she
has
found
a
vast
field
and
open
doors
to
teach
and
speak
on
the
*NL*
themes
of
education
,
temperance
,
and
good
home
building
,
industry
,
*NL*
morality
,
and
the
like
,
and
never
lacked
for
evidences
of
hearty
*NL*
appreciation
and
gratitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everywhere
help
was
needed
,
and
her
heart
being
deeply
absorbed
in
the
*NL*
cause
she
willingly
allowed
her
sympathies
to
impel
her
to
perform
most
*NL*
heroic
services
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
her
it
was
no
uncommon
occurrence
,
in
visiting
cities
or
towns
,
to
*NL*
speak
at
two
,
three
,
and
four
meetings
a
day
;
sometimes
to
promiscuous
*NL*
audiences
composed
of
everybody
who
would
care
to
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
kind
of
meetings
she
took
greatest
interest
in
were
meetings
*NL*
called
exclusively
for
women
.
In
this
attitude
she
could
pour
out
her
*NL*
sympathies
to
them
as
she
could
not
do
before
a
mixed
audience
;
and
*NL*
indeed
she
felt
their
needs
were
far
more
pressing
than
any
other
class
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
I
am
prepared
to
most
fully
indorse
her
story
.
I
doubt
whether
*NL*
she
could
,
if
she
had
tried
ever
so
much
,
have
hit
upon
a
subject
so
*NL*
well
adapted
to
reach
a
large
number
of
her
friends
and
the
public
with
*NL*
both
entertaining
and
instructive
matter
as
successfully
as
she
has
done
*NL*
in
this
volume
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
grand
and
ennobling
sentiments
which
have
characterized
all
her
*NL*
utterances
in
laboring
for
the
elevation
of
the
oppressed
will
not
be
*NL*
found
missing
in
this
book
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
previous
books
from
her
pen
,
which
have
been
so
very
widely
*NL*
circulated
and
admired
,
North
and
South
--
``
Forest
Leaves
,
''
``
Miscellaneous
*NL*
Poems
,
''
``
Moses
,
a
Story
of
the
Nile
,
''
``
Poems
,
''
and
``
Sketches
of
Southern
*NL*
Life
''
-LRB-
five
in
number
-RRB-
--
these
,
I
predict
,
will
be
by
far
eclipsed
by
*NL*
this
last
effort
,
which
will
,
in
all
probability
,
be
the
crowning
effort
*NL*
of
her
long
and
valuable
services
in
the
cause
of
humanity
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
,
as
indicated
,
Mrs.
Harper
has
done
a
large
amount
of
work
in
the
*NL*
South
,
she
has
at
the
same
time
done
much
active
service
in
the
*NL*
temperance
cause
in
the
North
,
as
thousands
of
this
class
can
testify
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
the
war
she
was
engaged
as
a
speaker
by
anti-slavery
*NL*
associations
;
since
then
,
by
appointment
of
the
Women
's
Christian
*NL*
Temperance
Union
,
she
has
held
the
office
of
``
Superintendent
of
Colored
*NL*
Work
''
for
years
.
She
has
also
held
the
office
of
one
of
the
Directors
of
*NL*
the
Women
's
Congress
of
the
United
States
.
*NL*
*NL*
Under
the
auspices
of
these
influential
,
earnest
,
and
intelligent
*NL*
associations
,
she
has
been
seen
often
on
their
platforms
with
the
*NL*
leading
lady
orators
of
the
nation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hence
,
being
widely
known
not
only
amongst
her
own
race
but
likewise
by
*NL*
the
reformers
,
laboring
for
the
salvation
of
the
intemperate
and
others
*NL*
equally
unfortunate
,
there
is
little
room
to
doubt
that
the
book
will
be
*NL*
in
great
demand
and
will
meet
with
warm
congratulations
from
a
goodly
*NL*
number
outside
of
the
author
's
social
connections
.
*NL*
*NL*
Doubtless
the
thousands
of
colored
Sunday-schools
in
the
South
,
in
*NL*
casting
about
for
an
interesting
,
moral
story-book
,
full
of
practical
*NL*
lessons
,
will
not
be
content
to
be
without

``
Good
mornin
'
,
Bob
;
how
's
butter
dis
mornin
'
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fresh
;
just
as
fresh
,
as
fresh
can
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
glory
!
''
said
the
questioner
,
whom
we
shall
call
Thomas
Anderson
,
*NL*
although
he
was
known
among
his
acquaintances
as
Marster
Anderson
's
Tom
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
informant
regarding
the
condition
of
the
market
was
Robert
Johnson
,
*NL*
who
had
been
separated
from
his
mother
in
his
childhood
and
reared
by
*NL*
his
mistress
as
a
favorite
slave
.
She
had
fondled
him
as
a
pet
animal
,
*NL*
and
even
taught
him
to
read
.
Notwithstanding
their
relation
as
mistress
*NL*
and
slave
,
they
had
strong
personal
likings
for
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
Anderson
was
the
servant
of
a
wealthy
planter
,
who
lived
in
the
city
*NL*
of
C
--
,
North
Carolina
.
This
planter
was
quite
advanced
in
life
,
but
*NL*
in
his
earlier
days
he
had
spent
much
of
his
time
in
talking
politics
in
*NL*
his
State
and
National
capitals
in
winter
,
and
in
visiting
pleasure
*NL*
resorts
and
watering
places
in
summer
.
His
plantations
were
left
to
the
*NL*
care
of
overseers
who
,
in
their
turn
,
employed
negro
drivers
to
aid
them
*NL*
in
the
work
of
cultivation
and
discipline
.
But
as
the
infirmities
of
age
*NL*
were
pressing
upon
him
he
had
withdrawn
from
active
life
,
and
given
the
*NL*
management
of
his
affairs
into
the
hands
of
his
sons
.
As
Robert
Johnson
*NL*
and
Thomas
Anderson
passed
homeward
from
the
market
,
having
bought
*NL*
provisions
for
their
respective
homes
,
they
seemed
to
be
very
*NL*
light-hearted
and
careless
,
chatting
and
joking
with
each
other
;
but
*NL*
every
now
and
then
,
after
looking
furtively
around
,
one
would
drop
into
*NL*
the
ears
of
the
other
some
news
of
the
battle
then
raging
between
the
*NL*
North
and
South
which
,
like
two
great
millstones
,
were
grinding
slavery
*NL*
to
powder
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
passed
along
,
they
were
met
by
another
servant
,
who
said
in
*NL*
hurried
tones
,
but
with
a
glad
accent
in
his
voice
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
see
de
fish
in
de
market
dis
mornin
'
?
Oh
,
but
dey
war
splendid
,
*NL*
jis
'
as
fresh
,
as
fresh
kin
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
ticket
,
''
said
Robert
,
as
a
broad
smile
overspread
his
face
.
*NL*
``
I
'll
see
you
later
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
mornin
'
,
boys
,
''
said
another
servant
on
his
way
to
market
.
``
How
's
*NL*
eggs
dis
mornin
'
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fust
rate
,
fust
rate
,
''
said
Tom
Anderson
.
``
Bob
's
got
it
down
fine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
so
;
mighty
long
faces
at
de
pos
'
-
office
dis
mornin
'
;
but
I
'd
*NL*
better
move
`
long
,
''
and
with
a
bright
smile
lighting
up
his
face
he
*NL*
passed
on
with
a
quickened
tread
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
seemed
to
be
an
unusual
interest
manifested
by
these
men
in
the
*NL*
state
of
the
produce
market
,
and
a
unanimous
report
of
its
good
*NL*
condition
.
Surely
there
was
nothing
in
the
primeness
of
the
butter
or
*NL*
the
freshness
of
the
eggs
to
change
careless
looking
faces
into
such
*NL*
expressions
of
gratification
,
or
to
light
dull
eyes
with
such
gladness
.
*NL*
What
did
it
mean
?
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
dark
days
of
the
Rebellion
,
when
the
bondman
was
turning
his
*NL*
eyes
to
the
American
flag
,
and
learning
to
hail
it
as
an
ensign
of
*NL*
deliverance
,
some
of
the
shrewder
slaves
,
coming
in
contact
with
their
*NL*
masters
and
overhearing
their
conversations
,
invented
a
phraseology
to
*NL*
convey
in
the
most
unsuspected
manner
news
to
each
other
from
the
*NL*
battle-field
.
Fragile
women
and
helpless
children
were
left
on
the
*NL*
plantations
while
their
natural
protectors
were
at
the
front
,
and
yet
*NL*
these
bondmen
refrained
from
violence
.
Freedom
was
coming
in
the
wake
of
*NL*
the
Union
army
,
and
while
numbers
deserted
to
join
their
forces
,
others
*NL*
remained
at
home
,
slept
in
their
cabins
by
night
and
attended
to
their
*NL*
work
by
day
;
but
under
this
apparently
careless
exterior
there
was
an
*NL*
undercurrent
of
thought
which
escaped
the
cognizance
of
their
masters
.
*NL*
In
conveying
tidings
of
the
war
,
if
they
wished
to
announce
a
victory
of
*NL*
the
Union
army
,
they
said
the
butter
was
fresh
,
or
that
the
fish
and
*NL*
eggs
were
in
good
condition
.
If
defeat
befell
them
,
then
the
butter
and
*NL*
other
produce
were
rancid
or
stale
.
*NL*
*NL*
Entering
his
home
,
Robert
set
his
basket
down
.
In
one
arm
he
held
a
*NL*
bundle
of
papers
which
he
had
obtained
from
the
train
to
sell
to
the
*NL*
boarders
,
who
were
all
anxious
to
hear
from
the
seat
of
battle
.
He
*NL*
slipped
one
copy
out
and
,
looking
cautiously
around
,
said
to
Linda
,
the
*NL*
cook
,
in
a
low
voice
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Splendid

Just

answering

found

suffering

a
severe

which
he
thought
was
occasioned

worrying
over

She
sent
him

executed

Although
the
slaves
were
denied
unrestricted
travel
,
and
the
holding
of
*NL*
meetings
without
the
surveillance
of
a
white
man
,
yet
they
contrived
to
*NL*
meet
by
stealth
and
hold
gatherings
where
they
could
mingle
their
*NL*
prayers
and
tears
,
and
lay
plans
for
escaping
to
the
Union
army
.
*NL*
Outwitting
the
vigilance
of
the
patrollers
and
home
guards
,
they
*NL*
established
these
meetings
miles
apart

extending
into
several
States

*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
their
hope
of
deliverance
was
cruelly
blighted
by
hearing
of
*NL*
some
adventurous
soul
who
,
having
escaped
to
the
Union
army
,
had
been
*NL*
pursued
and
returned
again
to
bondage

Yet
hope
survived
all
these
*NL*
disasters
which
gathered
around
the
fate
of
their
unfortunate
brethren
,
*NL*
who
were
remanded
to
slavery
through
the
undiscerning
folly
of
those
who
*NL*
were
strengthening
the
hands
which
were
dealing
their
deadliest
blows
at
*NL*
the
heart
of
the
Nation
.
But
slavery
had
cast
such
a
glamour
over
the
*NL*
Nation
,
and
so
warped
the
consciences
of
men
,
that
they
failed
to
read
*NL*
aright
the
legible
transcript
of
Divine
retribution
which
was
written
*NL*
upon
the
shuddering
earth

where
the

*NL*
A
few
evenings
after

conversation
between

,
a
*NL*
prayer-meeting
was
held
.
Under
the
cover
of
night
a
few
dusky
figures
*NL*
met
by
stealth
in
McCullough

woods

*NL*
``

approaching

the
leader
of

had
preceded
him

a
few
minutes

*NL*
*NL*
``

a
moment

then
said
:

``
Contraband

said
Robert
,
who
enjoyed
the
distinction
of
being
a
*NL*
good
reader
,
and
was
pretty
well
posted
about
the
war

Mrs.
Johnson
had
*NL*
taught
him
to
read
on
the
same
principle

would
have
taught
a
pet
*NL*
animal
amusing
tricks

She
had
never
imagined
the
time
would
come
when
*NL*
he
would
use
the
machinery
she
had
put
in
his
hands
to
help
overthrow
*NL*
the
institution
to
which
she
was
so
ardently
attached

*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Robert
,
a
little
vain
of
his
superior
knowledge

``
it
is
*NL*
the
best

of
one
run
away
,
the
other
has
a
right
to
take
them

it
is
*NL*
just
the

if
a
slave
runs
away
from
the
Secesh
to
the
Union
lines

*NL*
He
is
called
a

just

UNCLE
DANIEL
'S
STORY
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Union
had
snapped
asunder
because
it
lacked
the
cohesion
of
justice
,
*NL*
and
the
Nation
was
destined
to
pass
through
the
crucible
of
disaster
and
*NL*
defeat
,
till
she
was
ready
to
clasp
hands
with
the
negro
and
march
*NL*
abreast
with
him
to
freedom
and
victory
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Union
army
was
encamping
a
few
miles
from
C
--
,
in
North
Carolina
.
*NL*
Robert
,
being
well
posted
on
the
condition
of
affairs
,
had
stealthily
*NL*
contrived
to
call
a
meeting
in
Uncle
Daniel
's
cabin
.
Uncle
Daniel
's
wife
*NL*
had
gone
to
bed
as
a
sick
sister
,
and
they
held
a
prayer-meeting
by
her
*NL*
bedside
.
It
was
a
little
risky
,
but
as
Mr.
Thurston
did
not
encourage
*NL*
the
visits
of
the
patrollers
,
and
heartily
detested
having
them
prying
*NL*
into
his
cabins
,
there
was
not
much
danger
of
molestation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Uncle
Daniel
,
we
want
to
hear
your
story
,
and

*NL*
made
up
your

said
Robert
,
after
he
had
been
seated
*NL*
a
few
minutes
in
Uncle
Daniel

cabin

*NL*
*NL*

But

you

now
that
*NL*
Daniel
had
finished
his
story
;
``

*NL*
Aunt

turned
her
face
towards
the
speaker

It
was
a
thoughtful
,
*NL*
intelligent
face
,
saintly
and
calm
.
A
face
which
expressed
the
idea
of
a
*NL*
soul
which
had
been
fearfully
tempest
tossed
,
but
had
passed
through
*NL*
suffering
into
peace
.
Very
touching
was
the
look
of
resignation
and
hope
*NL*
which
overspread
her
features
as
she
replied
,
with
the
simple
child-like
*NL*
faith
which
she
had
learned
in
the
darkest
hour
,
``
The
Lord
says
,
we
must
*NL*
forgive
.
''
And
with
her
that
thought
,
as
coming
from
the
lips
of
Divine
*NL*
Love
,
was
enough
to
settle
the
whole
question
of
forgiveness
of
injuries
*NL*
and
love
to
enemies

Uncle

There

tremor

addressing
a
stalwart

whose
towering

form

darkly
flashing

told
that
slavery
had
failed

put
the
*NL*
crouch
in

As
Ben

looked
at
the
speaker

a
spasm
of
agony
and
anger
darkened
*NL*
his
face
and
distorted
his
features
,
as
if
the
blood
of
some
strong
*NL*
race
were
stirring
with
sudden
vigor
through
his
veins

He
clutched
his
*NL*
hands
together
,
as
if
he
were
struggling
with
an
invisible
foe
,
and
for
*NL*
a
moment
he
remained
silent

Then
suddenly
raising
his
head

he
*NL*
exclaimed
,
``

*NL*
*NL*
It
was
touching
to
see
the
sorrow
on
the
strong
face
,
to
detect
the
*NL*
pathos
and
indignation
in
his
voice
,
as
he
said
,
``
I
used
to
love
Mirandy
*NL*
as
I
love
my
life
.
I
thought
the
sun
rose
and
set
in
her
.
I
never
saw
a
*NL*
handsomer
woman
than
she
was
.
But
she
fooled
me
all
over
the
face
and
*NL*
eyes
,
and
took
up
with
that
hell-hound
of
a
trader
,
Lukens
;
an
'
he
gave
*NL*
her
a
chance
to
live
easy
,
to
wear
fine
clothes
,
an
'
be
waited
on
like
a
*NL*
lady
.
I
thought
at
first
I
would
go
crazy
,
but
my
poor
mammy
did
all
she
*NL*
could
to
comfort
me
.
She
would
tell
me
there
were
as
good
fish
in
the
*NL*
sea
as
were
ever
caught
out
of
it
.
Many
a
time
I
've
laid
my
poor
head
on
*NL*
her
lap
,
when
it
seemed
as
if
my
brain
was
on
fire
and
my
heart
was
*NL*
almost
ready
to
burst
.
But
in
course
of
time
I
got
over
the
worst
of
*NL*
it
;
an
'
Mirandy
is
the
first
an
'
last
woman
that
ever
fooled
me
.
But
*NL*
that
dear
old
mammy
of
mine
,
I
mean
to
stick
by
her
as
long
as
there
is
*NL*
a
piece
of
her
.
I
ca
n't
go
over
to
the
army
an
'
leave
her
behind
,
for
if
*NL*
I
did
,
an
'
anything
should
happen
,
I
would
never
forgive
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
could
n't
you
take
her
with
you
,
''
said
Robert
,
``
the
soldiers
said
we
*NL*
could
bring
our
women
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
n't
that
.
The
Union
army
is
several
miles
from
here
,
an
'
my
poor
*NL*
mammy
is
so
skeery
that
,
if
I
were
trying
to
get
her
away
and
any
of
*NL*
them
Secesh
would
overtake
us
,
an
'
begin
to
question
us
,
she
would
get
*NL*
skeered
almost
to
death
,
an
'
break
down
an
'
begin
to
cry
,
an
'
then
the
*NL*
fat
would
be
in
the
fire
.
So
,
while
I
love
freedom
more
than
a
child
*NL*
loves
its
mother
's
milk
,
I
've
made
up
my
mind
to
stay
on
the
plantation
.
*NL*
I
wish
,
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
,
I
could
go

But
I
ca
n't
take
her
*NL*
along
with
me
,
an
'
I
do
n't
want
to
be
free
and
leave
her
behind
in
*NL*
slavery
.
I
was
only
five
years
old
when
my
master
and
,
as
I
believe
,
*NL*
father
,
sold
us
both
here
to
this
lower
country
,
an
'
we
've
been
here
*NL*
ever
since
.
It
's
no
use
talking
,
I
wo
n't
leave
her
to
be
run
over
by
*NL*
everybody

A

evenings
after

interview
,
the
Union

entered
the

established

A

stampede

as

sat
alone
in

room
reading
the

from

he
had
secreted
,
he
heard
a
cautious
tread
and
a
low
tap
at
his
*NL*
window
.
He
opened
the
door
quietly
and
whispered
:

''
*NL*
*NL*
Robert
Johnson
's
heart
gave
a
great
bound
.
Was
that
so
?
Had
that
army
,
*NL*
with
freedom
emblazoned
on
its
banners
,
come
at
last
to
offer
them
*NL*
deliverance
if
they
would
accept
it
?
Was
it
a
bright
,
beautiful
dream
,
*NL*
or
a
blessed
reality
soon
to
be
grasped
by
his
willing
hands
?
His
heart
*NL*
grew
buoyant
with
hope
;
the
lightness
of
his
heart
gave
elasticity
to
*NL*
his
step
and
sent
the
blood
rejoicingly
through
his
veins
.
Freedom
was
*NL*
almost
in
his
grasp
,
and
the
future
was
growing
rose-tinted
and
*NL*
rainbow-hued
.
All
the
ties
which
bound
him
to
his
home
were
as
ropes
of
*NL*
sand
,
now
that
freedom
had
come
so
near
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
army
was
afar
off
,
he
had
appeared
to
be
light-hearted
and
*NL*
content
with
his
lot
.
If
asked
if
he
desired
his
freedom
,
he
would
have
*NL*
answered
,
very
naively
,
that
he
was
eating
his
white
bread
and
believed
*NL*
in
letting
well
enough
alone
;
he
had
no
intention
of
jumping
from
the
*NL*
frying-pan
into
the
fire
.
But
in
the
depths
of
his
soul
the
love
of
*NL*
freedom
was
an
all-absorbing
passion
;
only
danger
had
taught
him
*NL*
caution
.
He
had
heard
of
terrible
vengeance
being
heaped
upon
the
heads
*NL*
of
some
who
had
sought
their
freedom
and
failed
in
the
attempt
.
Robert
*NL*
knew
that
he
might
abandon
hope
if
he
incurred
the
wrath
of
men
whose
*NL*
overthrow
was
only
a
question
of
time
.
It
would
have
been
madness
and
*NL*
folly
for
him
to
have
attempted
an
insurrection
against
slavery
,
with
*NL*
the
words
of
McClellan
ringing
in
his
ears
:
``
If
you
rise
I
shall
put
you
*NL*
down
with
an
iron
hand
,
''
and
with
the
home
guards
ready
to
quench
his
*NL*
aspirations
for
freedom
with
bayonets
and
blood
.
What
could
a
set
of
*NL*
unarmed
and
undisciplined
men
do
against
the
fearful
odds
which
beset
*NL*
their
path
?
*NL*
*NL*
Robert
waited
eagerly
and
hopefully
his
chance
to
join
the
Union
army
;
*NL*
and
was
ready
and
willing
to
do
anything
required
of
him
by
which
he
*NL*
could
earn
his
freedom
and
prove
his
manhood
.
He
conducted
his
plans
*NL*
with
the
greatest
secrecy
.
A
few
faithful
and
trusted
friends
stood
*NL*
ready
to
desert
with
him
when
the
Union
army
came
within
hailing
*NL*
distance
.
When
it
came
,
there
was
a
stampede
to
its
ranks
of
men
ready
*NL*
to
serve
in
any
capacity
,
to
labor
in
the
tents
,
fight
on
the
fields
,
or
*NL*
act
as
scouts
.
It
was
a
strange
sight
to
see
these
black
men
rallying
*NL*
around
the
Stars
and
Stripes
,
when
white
men
were
trampling
them
under
*NL*
foot
and
riddling
them
with
bullets
.

*NL*
THE
RELEASE
OF
IOLA
LEROY
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
boys
,
''
said
Robert
to
his
trusted
friends
,
as
they
gathered
*NL*
together
at
a
meeting
in
Gundover
's
woods
,
almost
under
the
shadow
of
*NL*
the
Union
army
,
``
how
many
of
you
are
ready
to
join
the
army
and
fight
*NL*
for
your
freedom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
ob
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
soldiers
,
''
continued
Robert
,
``
are
camped
right
at
the
edge
of
the
*NL*
town
.
The
General
has
his
headquarters
in
the
heart
of
the
town
,
and
one
*NL*
of
the
officers
told
me
yesterday
that
the
President
had
set
us
all
*NL*
free
,
and
that
as
many
as
wanted
to
join
the
army
could
come
along
to
*NL*
the
camp
.
So
I
thought
,
boys
,
that
I
would
come
and
tell
you
.
Now
,
you
*NL*
can
take
your
bag
and
baggage
,
and
get
out
of
here
as
soon
as
you
*NL*
choose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
be
ready
by
daylight
,
''
said
Tom
.
``
It
wo
n't
take
me
long
to
pack
*NL*
up
,
''
looking
down
at
his
seedy
clothes
,
with
a
laugh
.
``
I
specs

*NL*
Marse

be
real
lonesome
when

An

*NL*
*NL*
``
O

well

''
said
Robert
,
``
the
best
of
friends
must
part

Do
n't

*NL*
*NL*
``

one
of
the
company

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Tom
;
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do

*NL*
*NL*
``

to
his
brudder
;
*NL*
tellin

him
she
war
mighty
airish

but
he
meant
to
break
her
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
An
angry
curse
rose
to
the
lips
of
Robert
,
but
he
repressed
it
and
*NL*
muttered
to
himself
,
``
Graceless
scamp
,
he
ought
to
have
his
neck
*NL*
stretched
.
''
Then
turning
to
Tom
,
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
her
,
if
you
possibly
can
,
but
you
must
be
mighty
mum
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Trus
'
me
for
dat
,
''
said
Tom
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
was
very
anxious
to
get
word
to
the
beautiful
but
intractable
girl
*NL*
who
was
held
in
durance
vile
by
her
reckless
and
selfish
master
,
who
had
*NL*
tried
in
vain
to
drag
her
down
to
his
own
low
level
of
sin
and
shame
.
*NL*
But
all
Tom
's
efforts
were
in
vain
.
Finally
he
applied
to
the
Commander
*NL*
of
the
post
,
who
immediately
gave
orders
for
her
release
.
The
next
day
*NL*
Tom
had
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
Iola
Leroy
had
been
taken
as
a
*NL*
trembling
dove
from
the
gory
vulture
's
nest
and
given
a
place
of
*NL*
security
.
She
was
taken
immediately
to
the
General
's
headquarters
.
The
*NL*
General
was
much
impressed
by
her
modest
demeanor
,
and
surprised
to
see
*NL*
the
refinement
and
beauty
she
possessed
.
Could
it
be
possible
that
this
*NL*
young
and
beautiful
girl
had
been
a
chattel
,
with
no
power
to
protect
*NL*
herself
from
the
highest
insults
that
lawless
brutality
could
inflict
*NL*
upon
innocent
and
defenseless
womanhood
?
Could
he
ever
again
glory
in
*NL*
his
American
citizenship
,
when
any
white
man
,
no
matter
how
coarse
,
*NL*
cruel
,
or
brutal
,
could
buy
or
sell
her
for
the
basest
purposes
?
Was
it
*NL*
not
true
that
the
cause
of
a
hapless
people
had
become
entangled
with
*NL*
the
lightnings
of
heaven
,
and
dragged
down
retribution
upon
the
land
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
field
hospital
was
needing
gentle
,
womanly
ministrations
,
and
Iola
*NL*
Leroy
,
released
from
the
hands
of
her
tormentors
,
was
given
a
place
as
*NL*
nurse
;
a
position
to
which
she
adapted
herself
with
a
deep
sense
of
*NL*
relief
.
Tom
was
doubly
gratified
at
the
success
of
his
endeavors
,
which
*NL*
had
resulted
in
the
rescue
of
the
beautiful
young
girl
and
the
*NL*
discomfiture
of
his
young
master
who
,
in
the
words
of
Tom
,
``
was
mad
*NL*
enough
to
bite
his
head
off
''
-LRB-
a
rather
difficult
physical
feat
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
Iola
,
freed
from
her
master
's
clutches
,
applied
herself
readily
to
her
*NL*
appointed
tasks
.
The
beautiful
,
girlish
face
was
full
of
tender
*NL*
earnestness
.
The
fresh
,
young
voice
was
strangely
sympathetic
,
as
if
*NL*
some
great
sorrow
had
bound
her
heart
in
loving
compassion
to
every
*NL*
sufferer
who
needed
her
gentle
ministrations
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
Anderson
was
a
man
of
herculean
strength
and
remarkable
courage
.
*NL*
But
,
on
account
of
physical
defects
,
instead
of
enlisting
as
a
soldier
,
*NL*
he
was
forced
to
remain
a
servant
,
although
he
felt
as
if
every
nerve
in
*NL*
his
right
arm
was
tingling
to
strike
a
blow
for
freedom
.
He
was
well
*NL*
versed
in
the
lay
of
the
country
,
having
often
driven
his
master
's
*NL*
cotton
to
market
when
he
was
a
field
hand
.
After
he
became
a
coachman
,
*NL*
he
had
become
acquainted
with
the
different
roads
and
localities
of
the
*NL*
country
.
Besides
,
he
had
often
accompanied
his
young
masters
on
their
*NL*
hunting
and
fishing
expeditions
.
Although
he
could
not
fight
in
the
*NL*
army
,
he
proved
an
invaluable
helper
.
When
tents
were
to
be
pitched
,
*NL*
none
were
more
ready
to
help
than
he
.
When
burdens
were
to
be
borne
,
*NL*
none
were
more
willing
to
bend
beneath
them
than
Thomas
Anderson
.
When
*NL*
the
battle-field
was
to
be
searched
for
the
wounded
and
dying
,
no
hand
*NL*
was
more
tender
in
its
ministrations
of
kindness
than
his
.
As
a
general
*NL*
factotum
in
the
army
,
he
was
ever
ready
and
willing
to
serve
anywhere
*NL*
and
at
any
time
,
and
to
gather
information
from
every
possible
source
*NL*
which
could
be
of
any
service
to
the
Union
army
.
As
a
Pagan
might
*NL*
worship
a
distant
star
and
wish
to
call
it
his
own
,
so
he
loved
Iola
.
*NL*
And
he
never
thought
he
could
do
too
much
for
the
soldiers
who
had
*NL*
rescued
her
and
were
bringing
deliverance
to
his
race
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
think
of
Miss
Iola
?
''
Robert
asked
him
one
day
,
as
they
were
*NL*
talking
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

CHAPTER

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
ROBERT
JOHNSON
'S
PROMOTION
AND
RELIGION
.
*NL*
*NL*
Robert
Johnson
,
being
able
to
meet
the
army
requirements
,
was
enlisted
*NL*
as
a
substitute
to
help
fill
out
the
quota
of
a
Northern
regiment
.
With
*NL*
his
intelligence
,
courage
,
and
prompt
obedience
,
he
rose
from
the
ranks
*NL*
and
became
lieutenant
of
a
colored
company
.
He
was
daring
,
without
being
*NL*
rash
;
prompt
,
but
not
thoughtless
;
firm
,
without
being
harsh
.
Kind
and
*NL*
devoted
to
the
company
he
drilled
,
he
soon
won
the
respect
of
his
*NL*
superior
officers
and
the
love
of
his
comrades
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Johnson
,
''
said
a
young
officer
,
Captain
Sybil
,
of
Maine
,
who
had
become
*NL*
attached
to
Robert
,
``
what
is
the
use
of
your
saying
you
're
a
colored
*NL*
man
,
when
you
are
as
white
as
I
am
,
and
as
brave
a
man
as
there
is
among
*NL*
us
.
Why
not
quit
this
company
,
and
take
your
place
in
the
army
just
the
*NL*
same
as
a
white
man
?
I
know
your
chances
for
promotion
would
be
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Captain
,
you
may
doubt
my
word
,
but
to-day
I
would
rather
be
a
*NL*
lieutenant
in
my
company
than
a
captain
in
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Captain
,
when
a
man
's
been
colored
all
his
life
it
comes
a
little
*NL*
hard
for
him
to
get
white
all
at
once
.
Were
I
to
try
it
,
I
would
feel
*NL*
like
a
cat
in
a
strange
garret
.
Captain
,
I
think
my
place
is
where
I
am
*NL*
most
needed
.
You
do
not
need
me
in
your
ranks
,
and
my
company
does
.
*NL*
They
are
excellent
fighters
,
but
they
need
a
leader
.
To
silence
a
*NL*
battery
,
to
capture
a
flag
,
to
take
a
fortification
,
they
will
rush
into
*NL*
the
jaws
of
death
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
have
often
wondered
at
their
bravery
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Captain
,
these
battles
put
them
on
their
mettle
.
They
have
been
so
long
*NL*
taught
that
they
are
nothing
and
nobody
,
that
they
seem
glad
to
prove
*NL*
they
are
something
and
somebody
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Johnson
,
you
do
not
look
like
them
,
you
do
not
talk
like
them
.
It
*NL*
is
a
burning
shame
to
have
held
such
a
man
as
you
in
slavery
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
it
was
any
worse
to
have
held
me
in
slavery
than
the
*NL*
blackest
man
in
the
South
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right
,
Johnson
.
The
color
of
a
man
's
skin
has
nothing
to
do
*NL*
with
the
possession
of
his
rights
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
there
is
Tom
Anderson
,
''
said
Robert
,
``
he
is
just
as
black
as
black
*NL*
can
be
.
He
has
been
bought
and
sold
like
a
beast
,
and
yet
there
is
not
a
*NL*
braver
man
in
all
the
company
.
I
know
him
well
.
He
is
a
noble-hearted
*NL*
fellow
.
True
as
steel
.
I
love
him
like
a
brother
.
And
I
believe
Tom
*NL*
would
risk
his
life
for
me
any
day
.
He
do
n't
know
anything
about
his
*NL*
father
or
mother
.
He
was
sold
from
them
before
he
could
remember
.
He
can
*NL*
read
a
little
.
He
used
to
take
lessons
from
a
white
gardener
in
*NL*
Virginia
.
He
would
go
between
the
hours
of
9
P.M.
and
4
A.M.
.
He
got
a
*NL*
book
of
his
own
,
tore
it
up
,
greased
the
pages
,
and
hid
them
in
his
hat
.
*NL*
Then
if
his
master
had
ever
knocked
his
hat
off
he
would
have
thought
*NL*
them
greasy
papers
,
and
not
that
Tom
was
carrying
his
library
on
his
*NL*
head
.
I
had
another
friend
who
lived
near
us
.
When
he
was
nineteen
*NL*
years
old
he
did
not
know
how
many
letters
there
were
in
the
ABC
's
.
One
*NL*
night
,
when
his
work
was
done
,
his
boss
came
into
his
cabin
and
saw
him
*NL*
with
a
book
in
his
hand
.
He
threatened
to
give
him
five
hundred
lashes
*NL*
if
he
caught
him
again
with
a
book
,
and
said
he
had
n't
work
enough
to
*NL*
do
.
He
was
getting
out
logs
,
and
his
task
was
ten
logs
a
day
.
His
*NL*
employer
threatened
to
increase
it
to
twelve
.
He
said
it
just
harassed
*NL*
him
;
it
set
him
on
fire
.
He
thought
there
must
be
something
good
in
that
*NL*
book
if
the
white
man
did
n't
want
him
to
learn
.
One
day
he
had
an
errand
*NL*
in
the
kitchen
,
and
he
heard
one
of
the
colored
girls
going
over
the
*NL*
ABC
's
.
Here
was
the
key
to
the
forbidden
knowledge
.
She
had
heard
the
*NL*
white
children
saying
them
,
and
picked
them
up
by
heart
,
but
did
not
*NL*
know
them
by
sight
.
He
was
not
content
with
that
,
but
sold
his
cap
for
a
*NL*
book
and
wore
a
cloth
on
his
head
instead
.
He
got
the
sounds
of
the
*NL*
letters
by
heart
,
then
cut
off
the
bark
of
a
tree
,
carved
the
letters
on
*NL*
the
smooth
inside
,
and
learned
them
.
He
wanted
to
learn
how
to
write
.
He
*NL*
had
charge
of
a
warehouse
where
he
had
a
chance
to
see
the
size
and
form
*NL*
of
letters
.
He
made
the
beach
of
the
river
his
copybook
,
and
thus
he
*NL*
learned
to
write
.
Tom
never
got
very
far
with
his
learning
,
but
I
used
*NL*
to
get
the
papers
and
tell
him
all
I
knew
about
the
war
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
did
you
get
the
papers
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
used
to
have
very
good
privileges
for
a
slave
.
All
of
our
owners
were
*NL*
not
alike
.
Some
of
them
were
quite
clever
,
and
others
were
worse
than
*NL*
git
out
.
I
used
to
get
the
morning
papers
to
sell
to
the
boarders
and
*NL*
others
,
and
when
I
got
them
I
would
contrive
to
hide
a
paper
,
and
let
*NL*
some
of
the
fellow-servants
know
how
things
were
going
on
.
And
our
*NL*
owners
thought
we
cared
nothing
about
what
was
going
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
was
that
?
I
thought
you
were
not
allowed
to
hold
meetings
unless
a
*NL*
white
man
were
present
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
so
.
But
we
contrived
to
hold
secret
meetings
in
spite
of
their
*NL*
caution
.
We
knew
whom
we
could
trust
.
My
ole
Miss
was
n't
mean
like
some
*NL*
of
them
.
She
never
wanted
the
patrollers
around
prowling
in
our
cabins
,
*NL*
and
poking
their
noses
into
our
business
.
Her
husband
was
an
awful
*NL*
drunkard
.
He
ran
through
every
cent
he
could
lay
his
hands
on
,
and
she
*NL*
was
forced
to
do
something
to
keep
the
wolf
from
the
door
,
so
she
set
up
*NL*
a
boarding-house
.
But
she
did
n't
take
in
Tom
,
Dick
,
and
Harry
.
Nobody
*NL*
but
the
big
bugs
stopped
with
her
.
She
taught
me
to
read
and
write
,
and
*NL*
to
cast
up
accounts
.
It
was
so
handy
for
her
to
have
some
one
who
could
*NL*
figure
up
her
accounts
,
and
read
or
write
a
note
,
if
she
were
from
home
*NL*
and
wanted
the
like
done
.
She
once
told
her
cousin
how
I
could
write
and
*NL*
figure
up
.
And
what
do
you
think
her
cousin
said
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Pleased
,
'
I
suppose
,
`
to
hear
it
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
bit
of
it
.
She
said
,
if
I
belonged
to
her
,
she
would
cut
off
my
*NL*
thumbs
;
her
husband
said
,
`
Oh
,
then
he
could
n't
pick
cotton
.
'
As
to
my
*NL*
poor
thumbs
,
it
did
not
seem
to
be
taken
into
account
what
it
would
cost
*NL*
me
to
lose
them
.
My
ole
Miss
used
to
have
a
lot
of
books
.
She
would
let
*NL*
me
read
any
one
of
them
except
a
novel
.
She
wanted
to
take
care
of
my
*NL*
soul
,
but
she
was
n't
taking
care
of
her
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
n't
she
religious
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
went
for
it
.
I
suppose
she
was
as
good
as
most
of
them
.
She
said
*NL*
her
prayers
and
went
to
church
,
but
I
do
n't
know
that
that
made
her
any
*NL*
better
.
I
never
did
take
much
stock
in
white
folks
'
religion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Robert
,
I
'm
afraid
you
are
something
of
an
infidel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Captain
,
I
believe
in
the
real
,
genuine
religion
.
I
ai
n't
got
much
*NL*
myself
,
but
I
respect
them
that
have
.
We
had
on
our
place
a
dear
,
old
*NL*
saint
,
named
Aunt
Kizzy
.
She
was
a
happy
soul
.
She
had
seen
hard
times
,
*NL*
but
was
what
I
call
a
living
epistle
.
I
've
heard
her
tell
how
her
only
*NL*
child
had
been
sold
from
her
,
when
the
man
who
bought
herself
did
not
*NL*
want
to
buy
her
child
.
Poor
little
fellow
!
he
was
only
two
years
old
.
I
*NL*
asked
her
one
day
how
she
felt
when
her
child
was
taken
away
.
'
I
felt
,
'
*NL*
she
said
,
`
as
if
I
was
going
to
my
grave
.
But
I
knew
if
I
could
n't
get
*NL*
justice
here
,
I
could
get
it
in
another
world
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
faith
,
''
said
Captain
Sybil
,
as
if
speaking
to
himself
,
``
a
*NL*
patient
waiting
for
death
to
redress
the
wrongs
of
life

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Many
a
time

''
continued
Robert
,
``
have
I
heard
her
humming
to
herself
in

the
kitchen
and
saying
,

I
has

downs

began
with

*NL*
``
I

Captain

with

I

I
do
think

in

underlain

life

has
been
a
golden

Now
,
Captain

*NL*
that

Not

talk

solemn
with

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
yes
,
Robert
,
I
think
you
are
more
than
half
right
.
You
ought
to
*NL*
know
my
dear
,
old
mother
who
lives
in
Maine
.
We
have
had
colored
company
*NL*
at
our
house
,
and
I
never
saw
her
show
the
least
difference
between
her
*NL*
colored
and
white
guests
.
She
is
a
Quaker
preacher
,
and
do
n't
believe
*NL*
in
war
,
but
when
the
rest
of
the
young
men
went
to
the
front
,
I
wanted
*NL*
to
go
also
.
So
I
thought
it
all
over
,
and
there
seemed
to
be
no
way
out
*NL*
of
slavery
except
through
the
war
.
I
had
been
taught
to
hate
war
and
*NL*
detest
slavery
.
Now
the
time
had
come
when
I
could
not
help
the
war
,
but
*NL*
I
could
strike
a
blow
for
freedom
.
So
I
told
my
mother
I
was
going
to
*NL*
the
front
,
that
I
expected
to
be
killed
,
but
I
went
to
free
the
slave
.
*NL*
It
went
hard
with
her
.
But
I
thought
that
I
ought
to
come
,
and
I
believe
*NL*
my
mother
's
prayers
are
following
me

*NL*
``
Captain
,
''
said
Robert
,
rising
,
``
I
am
glad
that
I
have
heard
your
story
.
*NL*
I
think
that
some
of
these
Northern
soldiers
do
two
things
--
hate
slavery
*NL*
and
hate
niggers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
that
is
so
with
some
of
them
.
They
would
rather
be
whipped
*NL*
by
Rebels
than
conquer
with
negroes
.
Oh
,
I
heard
a
soldier
,
''
said
*NL*
Captain
Sybil
,
``
say
,
when
the
colored
men
were
being
enlisted
,
that
he
*NL*
would
break
his
sword
and
resign
.
But
he
did
n't
do
either
.
After
Colonel
*NL*
Shaw
led
his
charge
at
Fort
Wagner
,
and
died
in
the
conflict
,
he
got
*NL*
bravely
over
his
prejudices
.
The
conduct
of
the
colored
troops
there
and
*NL*
elsewhere
has
done
much
to
turn
public
opinion
in
their
favor
.
I
suppose
*NL*
any
white
soldier
would
rather
have
his
black
substitute
receive
the
*NL*
bullets
than
himself

TOM
ANDERSON
'S
DEATH
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
Tom
?
''
asked
Captain
Sybil
;
``
I
have
not
seen
him
for
several
*NL*
hours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
gone
down
the
sound
with
some
of
the
soldiers
,
''
replied
Robert
.
*NL*
``
They
wanted
Tom
to
row
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
those
boys
will
get
into
trouble
,
and
the
Rebs
will
pick
*NL*
them
off
,
''
responded
Sybil
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
I
hope
not
,
''
answered
Robert
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
not
,
too
;
but
those
boys
are
too
venturesome
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom
knows
the
lay
of
the
land
better
than
any
of
us
,
''
said
Robert
.
``
He
*NL*
is
the
most
wide-awake
and
gamiest
man
I
know
.
I
reckon
when
the
war
is
*NL*
over
Tom
will
be
a
preacher
.
Did
you
ever
hear
him
pray
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
is
he
good
at
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
First-rate
,
''
continued
Robert
.
``
It
would
do
you
good
to
hear
him
.
He
*NL*
do
n't
allow
any
cursing
and
swearing
when
he
's
around
.
And
what
he
says
*NL*
is
law
and
gospel
with
the
boys
.
But
he
's
so
good-natured
;
and
they
*NL*
ca
n't
get
mad
at
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Robert
,
there
is
not
a
man
in
our
regiment
I
would
sooner
trust
*NL*
than
Tom
.
Last
night
,
when
he
brought
in
that
wounded
scout
,
he
could
n't
*NL*
have
been
more
tender
if
he
had
been
a
woman
.
How
gratefully
the
poor
*NL*
fellow
looked
in
Tom
's
face
as
he
laid
him
down
so
carefully
and
*NL*
staunched
the
blood
which
had
been
spurting
out
of
him
.
Tom
seemed
to
*NL*
know
it
was
an
artery
which
had
been
cut
,
and
he
did
just
the
right
*NL*
thing
to
stop
the
bleeding
.
He
knew
there
was
n't
a
moment
to
be
lost
.
He
*NL*
was
n't
going
to
wait
for
the
doctor
.
I
have
often
heard
that
colored
*NL*
people
are
ungrateful
,
but
I
do
n't
think
Tom
's
worst
enemy
would
say
*NL*
that
about
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Captain
,
''
said
Robert
,
with
a
tone
of
bitterness
in
his
voice
,
``
what
*NL*
had
we
to
be
grateful
for
?
For
ages
of
poverty
,
ignorance
,
and
slavery
?
*NL*
I
think
if
anybody
should
be
grateful
,
it
is
the
people
who
have
*NL*
enslaved
us
and
lived
off
our
labor
for
generations
.
Captain
,
I
used
to
*NL*
know
a
poor
old
woman
who
could
n't
bear
to
hear
any
one
play
on
the
*NL*
piano
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
so
?
Why
,
I
always
heard
that
colored
people
were
a
musical
*NL*
race
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
we
are
;
but
that
poor
woman
's
daughter
was
sold
,
and
her
mistress
*NL*
took
the
money
to
buy
a
piano
.
Her
mother
could
never
bear
to
hear
a
*NL*
sound
from
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
woman
!
''
exclaimed
Captain
Sybil
,
sympathetically
;
``
I
suppose
it
*NL*
seemed
as
if
the
wail
of
her
daughter
was
blending
with
the
tones
of
the
*NL*
instrument
.
I
think
,
Robert
,
there
is
a
great
deal
more
in
the
colored
*NL*
people
than
we
give
them
credit
for
.
Did
you
know
Captain
Sellers
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
officer
who
escaped
from
prison
and
got
back
to
our
lines
?
''
asked
*NL*
Robert
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
Well
,
he
had
quite
an
experience
in
trying
to
escape
.
He
came
to
*NL*
an
aged
couple
,
who
hid
him
in
their
cabin
and
shared
their
humble
food
*NL*
with
him
.
They
gave
him
some
corn-bread
,
bacon
,
and
coffee
which
he
*NL*
thought
was
made
of
scorched
bran
.
But
he
said
that
he
never
ate
a
meal
*NL*
that
he
relished
more
than
the
one
he
took
with
them
.
Just
before
he
*NL*
went
they
knelt
down
and
prayed
with
him
.
It
seemed
as
if
his
very
hair
*NL*
stood
on
his
head
,
their
prayer
was
so
solemn
.
As
he
was
going
away
the
*NL*
man
took
some
shingles
and
nailed
them
on
his
shoes
to
throw
the
*NL*
bloodhounds
off
his
track
.
I
do
n't
think
he
will
ever
cease
to
feel
*NL*
kindly
towards
colored
people
.
I
do
wonder
what
has
become
of
the
boys
?
*NL*
What
can
keep
them
so
long
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Just
as
Captain
Sybil
and
Robert
were
wondering
at
the
delay
of
Tom
and
*NL*
the
soldiers
they
heard
the
measured
tread
of
men
who
were
slowly
*NL*
bearing
a
burden
.
They
were
carrying
Tom
Anderson
to
the
hospital
,
*NL*
fearfully
wounded
,
and
nigh
to
death
.
His
face
was
distorted
,
and
the
*NL*
blood
was
streaming
from
his
wounds
.
His
respiration
was
faint
,
his
*NL*
pulse
hurried
,
as
if
life
were
trembling
on
its
frailest
cords
.
*NL*
*NL*
Robert
and
Captain
Sybil
hastened
at
once
towards
the
wounded
man
.
On
*NL*
Robert
's
face
was
a
look
of
intense
anguish
,
as
he
bent
pityingly
over
*NL*
his
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
this
is
dreadful
!
How
did
it
happen
?
''
cried
Robert
.
*NL*
*NL*
Captain
Sybil
,
pressing
anxiously
forward
,
repeated
Robert
's
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Captain
,
''
said
one
of
the
young
soldiers
,
advancing
and
saluting
his
*NL*
superior
officer
,
``
we
were
all
in
the
boat
when
it
struck
against
a
mud
*NL*
bank
,
and
there
was
not
strength
enough
among
us
to
shove
her
back
into
*NL*
the
water
.
Just
then
the
Rebels
opened
fire
upon
us
.
For
awhile
we
lay
*NL*
down
in
the
boat
,
but
still
they
kept
firing
.
Tom
took
in
the
whole
*NL*
situation
,
and
said
:
`
Someone
must
die
to
get
us
out
of
this
.
I
*NL*
mought
's
well
be
him
as
any
.
You
are
soldiers
and
can
fight
.
If
they
*NL*
kill
me
,
it
is
nuthin
'
.
'
So
Tom
leaped
out
to
shove
the
boat
into
the
*NL*
water
.
Just
then
the
Rebel
bullets
began
to
rain
around
him
.
He
received
*NL*
seven
or
eight
of
them
,
and
I
'm
afraid
there
is
no
hope
for
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
Tom
,
I
wish
you
had
n't
gone
.
O
,
Tom
!
Tom
!
''
cried
Robert
,
in
tones
of
*NL*
agony
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
gleam
of
grateful
recognition
passed
over
the
drawn
features
of
Tom
,
*NL*
as
the
wail
of
his
friend
fell
on
his
ear
.
He
attempted
to
speak
,
but
*NL*
the
words
died
upon
his
lips
,
and
he
became
unconscious
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Captain
Sybil
,
``
put
him
in
one
of
the
best
wards

Give
him
*NL*
into
Miss
Leroy
's
care

If
good
nursing
can
win
him
back
to

he
*NL*
shall
not
want

any
care
or
pains
that
she
can
bestow
.
Send
*NL*
immediately
for
Dr.
Gresham

''
*NL*
*NL*
Robert
followed
his
friend
into
the
hospital
,
tenderly
and
carefully
*NL*
helped
to
lay
him
down
,
and
remained
awhile
,
gazing
in
silent
grief
upon
*NL*
the
sufferer
.
Then
he
turned
to
go
,
leaving
him
in
the
hands
of
Iola
,
*NL*
but
hoping
against
hope
that
his
wounds
would
not
be
fatal
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
tender
devotion
Iola
watched
her
faithful
friend
.
He
recognized
her
*NL*
when
restored
to
consciousness
,
and
her
presence
was
as
balm
to
his
*NL*
wounds
.
He
smiled
faintly
,
took
her
hand
in
his
,
stroked
it
tenderly
,
*NL*
looked
wistfully
into
her
face
,
and
said
,

Tom
closed
his

lay
quiet

Tenderly
and
anxiously
Iola
watched
*NL*
over
him
as
the
hours
waned
away

The
doctor
came
,
shook
his
head
*NL*
gravely
,
and
,
turning
to
Iola
,
said
,
``
There

to

*NL*
*NL*
As
Iola
gazed
upon
the
kind
but
homely
features
of
Tom
,
she
saw
his
eyes
*NL*
open
and
an
unexpressed
desire
upon
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tenderly
and
sadly
bending
over
him
,
with
tears
in
her
dark
,
luminous
*NL*
eyes
,
she
said
,
``
Is

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Tom

with

*NL*
*NL*
Iola
laid
her
hand
gently
in
the
rough
palm
of
the
dying
man
,
and
,
with
*NL*
a
tremulous
voice
,
sang
the
parting
hymns
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tenderly
she
wiped
the
death
damps
from
his
dusky
brow
,
and
imprinted
*NL*
upon
it
a
farewell
kiss
.
Gratitude
and
affection
lit
up
the
dying
eye
,
*NL*
which
seemed
to
be
gazing
into
the
eternities

Just
then
Robert
entered
*NL*
the
room
,
and
,
seating
himself
quietly
by
Tom
's
bedside
,
read
the
death
*NL*
signs
in
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye

Robert

said
Tom
,
``
meet

Suddenly
a
look
*NL*
of
recognition
and
rapture
lit
up
his
face
,
and
he
murmured
,
``
Angels

*NL*
bright
angels

all
's
well

all
's
well

*NL*
*NL*
Slowly
his
hand
released
its
pressure
,
a
peaceful
calm
overspread
his
*NL*
countenance
,
and
without
a
sigh
or
murmur
Thomas
Anderson
,
Iola
's
*NL*
faithful
and
devoted
friend
,
passed
away
,
leaving
the
world
so
much
*NL*
poorer
for
her
than
it
was
before
.
Just
then
Dr.
Gresham
,
the
hospital
*NL*
physician
,
came
to
the
bedside
,
felt
for
the
pulse
which
would
never
*NL*
throb
again
,
and
sat
down
in
silence
by
the
cot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What

said
Iola

``

``

said
the
doctor

*NL*
*NL*
Iola
bowed
her
head
in
silent
sorrow
,
and
then
relieved
the
anguish
of
*NL*
her
heart
by
a
flood
of
tears
.
Robert
rose
,
and
sorrowfully
left
the
*NL*
room

*NL*
*NL*
Iola
,
with
tearful
eyes
and
aching
heart

clasped
the
cold
hands
over
*NL*
the
still
breast
,
closed
the
waxen
lid
over
the
eye
which
had
once
*NL*
beamed
with
kindness
or
flashed
with
courage
,
and
then
went
back

after
*NL*
the
burial

to
her
daily
round
of
duties

feeling
the
sad
missing
of

talk
like
a
lover
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
faint
flush
rose
to
the
cheek
of
Dr.
Gresham
as
he
smiled
,
and
said
,
*NL*
``
Oh
!
come
now
,
Colonel
,
ca
n't
a
man
praise
a
woman
without
being
in
love
*NL*
with
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
he
can
,
''
said
Col.
Robinson
;
``
but
I
know
where
such
*NL*
admiration
is
apt
to
lead
.
I
've
been
there
myself
.
But
,
Doctor
,
had
you
*NL*
not
better
defer
your
love-making
till
you
're
out
of
the
woods
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
assure
you
,
Colonel
,
I
am
not
thinking
of
love
or
courtship
.
That
is
*NL*
the
business
of
the
drawing-room
,
and
not
of
the
camp
.
But
she
did
*NL*
mystify
me
last
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
so
?
''
asked
Col.
Robinson
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
Tom
was
dying
,
''
responded
the
doctor
,
``
I
saw
that
beautiful
and
*NL*
refined
young
lady
bend
over
and
kiss
him
.
When
she
found
that
he
was
*NL*
dead
,
she
just
cried
as
if
her
heart
was
breaking
.
Well
,
that
was
a
new
*NL*
thing
to
me
.
I
can
eat
with
colored
people
,
walk
,
talk
,
and
fight
with
*NL*
them
,
but
kissing
them
is
something
I
do
n't
hanker
after
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
you
saw
Miss
Leroy
do
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
and
that
puzzles
me
.
She
is
one
of
the
most
refined
and
lady-like
*NL*
women
I
ever
saw
.
I
hear
she
is
a
refugee
,
but
she
does
not
look
like
*NL*
the
other
refugees
who
have
come
to
our
camp
.
Her
accent
is
slightly
*NL*
Southern
,
but
her
manner
is
Northern
.
She
is
self-respecting
without
*NL*
being
supercilious
;
quiet
,
without
being
dull
.
Her
voice
is
low
and
*NL*
sweet
,
yet
at
times
there
are
tones
of
such
passionate
tenderness
in
it
*NL*
that
you
would
think
some
great
sorrow
has
darkened
and
overshadowed
her
*NL*
life
.
Without
being
the
least
gloomy
,
her
face
at
times
is
pervaded
by
*NL*
an
air
of
inexpressible
sadness
.
I
sometimes
watch
her
when
she
is
not
*NL*
aware
that
I
am
looking
at
her
,
and
it
seems
as
if
a
whole
volume
was
*NL*
depicted
on
her
countenance
.
When
she
smiles
,
there
is
a
longing
in
her
*NL*
eyes
which
is
never
satisfied
.
I
can
not
understand
how
a
Southern
lady
,
*NL*
whose
education
and
manners
stamp
her
as
a
woman
of
fine
culture
and
*NL*
good
breeding
,
could
consent
to
occupy
the
position
she
so
faithfully
*NL*
holds
.
It
is
a
mystery
I
can
not
solve
.
Can
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
can
,
''
answered
Col.
Robinson
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
tell
me
?
''
queried
the
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
on
one
condition
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everlasting
silence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
promise
,
''
said
the
doctor
.
``
The
secret
between
us
shall
be
as
deep
as
*NL*
the
sea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
not
requested
secrecy
,
but
at
present
,
for
her
sake
,
I
do
not
*NL*
wish
the
secret
revealed
.
Miss
Leroy
was
a
slave
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
''
said
Dr.
Gresham
,
starting
to
his
feet
,
``
it
ca
n't
be
so
!
A
*NL*
woman
as
white
as
she
a
slave
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
is
so
,
''
continued
the
Colonel
.
``
In
these
States
the
child
*NL*
follows
the
condition
of
its
mother
.
This
beautiful
and
accomplished
*NL*
girl
was
held
by
one
of
the
worst
Rebels
in
town
.
Tom
told
me
of
it
and
*NL*
I
issued
orders
for
her
release
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
!
Is
that
so
?
''
said
Dr.
Gresham
,
thoughtfully
stroking
his
*NL*
beard
.
``
Wonders
will
never
cease
.
Why
,
I
was
just
beginning
to
think
*NL*
seriously
of
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
to
hinder
your
continuing
to
think
?
''
asked
Col.
Robinson
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
you
tell
me
changes
the
whole
complexion
of
affairs
,
''
replied
the
*NL*
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
that
be
so
I
am
glad
I
told
you
before
you
got
head
over
heels
in
*NL*
love
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Dr.
Gresham
,
absently
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Gresham
was
a
member
of
a
wealthy
and
aristocratic
family
,
proud
of
*NL*
its
lineage
,
which
it
could
trace
through
generations
of
good
blood
to
*NL*
its
ancestral
isle
.
He
had
become
deeply
interested
in
Iola
before
he
*NL*
had
heard
her
story
,
but
after
it
had
been
revealed
to
him
he
tried
to
*NL*
banish
her
from
his
mind
;
but
his
constant
observation
of
her
only
*NL*
increased
his
interest
and
admiration
.
The
deep
pathos
of
her
story
,
the
*NL*
tenderness
of
her
ministrations
,
bestowed
alike
on
black
and
white
,
and
*NL*
the
sad
loneliness
of
her
condition
,
awakened
within
him
a
desire
to
*NL*
defend
and
protect
her
all
through
her
future
life
.
The
fierce
clashing
*NL*
of
war
had
not
taken
all
the
romance
out
of
his
nature
.
In
Iola
he
saw
*NL*
realized
his
ideal
of
the
woman
whom
he
was
willing
to
marry
.
A
woman
,
*NL*
tender
,
strong
,
and
courageous
,
and
rescued
only
by
the
strong
arm
of
*NL*
his
Government
from
a
fate
worse
than
death
.
She
was
young
in
years
,
but
*NL*
old
in
sorrow
;
one
whom
a
sad
destiny
had
changed
from
a
light-hearted
*NL*
girl
to
a
heroic
woman
.
As
he
observed
her
,
he
detected
an
undertone
of
*NL*
sorrow
in
her
most
cheerful
words
,
and
observed
a
quick
flushing
and
*NL*
sudden
paling
of
her
cheek
,
as
if
she
were
living
over
scenes
that
were
*NL*
thrilling
her
soul
with
indignation
or
chilling
her
heart
with
horror
.
*NL*
As
nurse
and
physician
,
Iola
and
Dr.
Gresham
were
constantly
thrown
*NL*
together
.
His
friends
sent
him
magazines
and
books
,
which
he
gladly
*NL*
shared
with
her
.
The
hospital
was
a
sad
place
.
Mangled
forms
,
stricken
*NL*
down
in
the
flush
of
their
prime
and
energy
;
pale
young
corpses
,
*NL*
sacrificed
on
the
altar
of
slavery
,
constantly
drained
on
her
*NL*
sympathies
.
Dr.
Gresham
was
glad
to
have
some
reading
matter
which
might
*NL*
divert
her
mind
from
the
memories
of
her
mournful
past
,
and
also
furnish
*NL*
them
both
with
interesting
themes
of
conversation
in
their
moments
of
*NL*
relaxation
from
the
harrowing
scenes
through
which
they
were
constantly
*NL*
passing
.
Without
any
effort
or
consciousness
on
her
part
,
his
friendship
*NL*
ripened
into
love
.
To
him
her
presence
was
a
pleasure
,
her
absence
a
*NL*
privation
;
and
her
loneliness
drew
deeply
upon
his
sympathy
.
He
would
*NL*
have
merited
his
own
self-contempt
if
,
by
word
or
deed
,
he
had
done
*NL*
anything
to
take
advantage
of
her
situation
.
All
the
manhood
and
*NL*
chivalry
of
his
nature
rose
in
her
behalf
,
and
,
after
carefully
*NL*
revolving
the
matter
,
he
resolved
to
win
her
for
his
bride
,
bury
her
*NL*
secret
in
his
Northern
home
,
and
hide
from
his
aristocratic
relations
*NL*
all
knowledge
of
her
mournful
past
.
One
day
he
said
to
Iola
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
hospital
life
is
telling
on
you
.
Your
strength
is
failing
,
and
*NL*
although
you
possess
a
wonderful
amount
of
physical
endurance
,
you
must
*NL*
not
forget
that
saints
have
bodies
and
dwell
in
tabernacles
of
clay
,
*NL*
just
the
same
as
we
common
mortals
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Compliments
aside
,
''
she
said
,
smiling
;
``
what
are
you
driving
at
,
*NL*
Doctor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
,
''
he
replied
,
``
that
you
are
running
down
,
and
if
you
do
not
quit
*NL*
and
take
some
rest
you
will
be
our
patient
instead
of
our
nurse
.
You
'd
*NL*
better
take
a
furlough
,
go
North
,
and
return
after
the
first
frost
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doctor
,
if
that
is
your
only
remedy
,
''
replied
Iola
,
``
I
am
afraid
that
I
*NL*
am
destined
to
die
at
my
post
.
I
have
no
special
friends
in
the
North
,
*NL*
and
no
home
but
this
in
the
South
.
I
am
homeless
and
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
something
so
sad
,
almost
despairing
in
her
tones
,
in
the
*NL*
drooping
of
her
head
,
and
the
quivering
of
her
lip
,
that
they
stirred
*NL*
Dr.
Gresham
's
heart
with
sudden
pity
,
and
,
drawing
nearer
to
her
,
he
*NL*
said
,
``
Miss
Leroy
,
you
need
not
be
all
alone
.
Let
me
claim
the
privilege
*NL*
of
making
your
life
bright
and
happy
.
Iola
,
I
have
loved
you
ever
since
*NL*
I
have
seen
your
devotion
to
our
poor
,
sick
boys
.
How
faithfully
you
,
a
*NL*
young
and
gracious
girl
,
have
stood
at
your
post
and
performed
your
*NL*
duties
.
And
now
I
ask
,
will
you
not
permit
me
to
clasp
hands
with
you
*NL*
for
life
?
I
do
not
ask
for
a
hasty
reply
.
Give
yourself
time
to
think
*NL*
over
what
I
have
proposed

CHAPTER
IX
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
EUGENE
LEROY
AND
ALFRED
LORRAINE
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nearly
twenty
years
before
the
war
,
two
young
men
,
of
French
and
Spanish
*NL*
descent
,
sat
conversing
on
a
large
verandah
which
surrounded
an
ancient
*NL*
home
on
the
Mississippi
River
.
It
was
French
in
its
style
of
*NL*
architecture
,
large
and
rambling
,
with
no
hint
of
modern
improvements
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
owner
of
the
house
was
the
only
heir
of
a
Creole
planter
.
He
had
*NL*
come
into
possession
of
an
inheritance
consisting
of
vast
baronial
*NL*
estates
,
bank
stock
,
and
a
large
number
of
slaves
.
Eugene
Leroy
,
being
*NL*
deprived
of
his
parents
,
was
left
,
at
an
early
age
,
to
the
care
of
a
*NL*
distant
relative
,
who
had
sent
him
to
school
and
college
,
and
who
*NL*
occasionally
invited
him
to
spend
his
vacations
at
his
home
.
But
Eugene
*NL*
generally
declined
his
invitations
,
as
he
preferred
spending
his
*NL*
vacations
at
the
watering
places
in
the
North
,
with
their
fashionable
*NL*
and
not
always
innocent
gayeties
.
Young
,
vivacious
,
impulsive
,
and
*NL*
undisciplined
,
without
the
restraining
influence
of
a
mother
's
love
or
*NL*
the
guidance
of
a
father
's
hand
,
Leroy
found
himself
,
when
his
college
*NL*
days
were
over
,
in
the
dangerous
position
of
a
young
man
with
vast
*NL*
possessions
,
abundant
leisure
,
unsettled
principles
,
and
uncontrolled
*NL*
desires
.
He
had
no
other
object
than
to
extract
from
life
its
most
*NL*
seductive
draughts
of
ease
and
pleasure
.
His
companion
,
who
sat
opposite
*NL*
him
on
the
verandah
,
quietly
smoking
a
cigar
,
was
a
remote
cousin
,
a
*NL*
few
years
older
than
himself
,
the
warmth
of
whose
Southern
temperament
*NL*
had
been
modified
by
an
infusion
of
Northern
blood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eugene
was
careless
,
liberal
,
and
impatient
of
details
,
while
his
*NL*
companion
and
cousin
,
Alfred
Lorraine
,
was
selfish
,
eager
,
keen
,
and
*NL*
alert
;
also
hard
,
cold
,
methodical
,
and
ever
ready
to
grasp
the
main
*NL*
chance
.
Yet
,
notwithstanding
the
difference
between
them
,
they
had
*NL*
formed
a
warm
friendship
for
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alfred
,
''
said
Eugene
,
``
I
am
going
to
be
married
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lorraine
opened
his
eyes
with
sudden
wonder
,
and
exclaimed
:
``
Well
,
*NL*
that
's
the
latest
thing
out
!
Who
is
the
fortunate
lady
who
has
bound
you
*NL*
with
her
silken
fetters
?
Is
it
one
of
those
beautiful
Creole
girls
who
*NL*
were
visiting
Augustine
's
plantation
last
winter
?
I
watched
you
during
*NL*
our
visit
there
and
thought
that
you
could
not
be
proof
against
their
*NL*
attractions
.
Which
is
your
choice
?
It
would
puzzle
me
to
judge
between
*NL*
the
two
.
They
had
splendid
eyes
,
dark
,
luminous
,
and
languishing
;
lovely
*NL*
complexions
and
magnificent
hair
.
Both
were
delightful
in
their
manners
,
*NL*
refined
and
cultured
,
with
an
air
of
vivacity
mingled
with
their
repose
*NL*
of
manner
which
was
perfectly
charming
.
As
the
law
only
allows
us
one
,
*NL*
which
is
your
choice
?
Miss
Annette
has
more
force
than
her
sister
,
and
*NL*
if
I
could
afford
the
luxury
of
a
wife
she
would
be
my
choice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Alf
,
''
said
Eugene
,
``
I
see
that
you
are
a
practical
business
man
.
In
*NL*
marrying
you
want
a
wife
to
assist
you
as
an
efficient
plantation
*NL*
mistress
.
One
who
would
tolerate
no
waste
in
the
kitchen
and
no
disorder
*NL*
in
the
parlor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
so
,
''
responded
Lorraine
;
``
I
am
too
poor
to
marry
a
mere
parlor
*NL*
ornament
.
You
can
afford
to
do
it
;
I
can
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
,
if
I
were
as
poor
as
a
church
mouse
I
would
marry
the
woman
I
*NL*
love
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
fine
sentiments
,
''
said
Lorraine
,
``
and
were
I
as
rich
as
you
I
*NL*
would
indulge
in
them
also
.
You
know
,
when
my
father
died
I
had
great
*NL*
expectations
.
We
had
always
lived
in
good
style
,
and
I
never
thought
for
*NL*
a
moment
he
was
not
a
rich
man
,
but
when
his
estate
was
settled
I
found
*NL*
it
was
greatly
involved
,
and
I
was
forced
to
face
an
uncertain
future
,
*NL*
with
scarcely
a
dollar
to
call
my
own
.
Land
,
negroes
,
cattle
,
and
horses
*NL*
all
went
under
the
hammer
.
The
only
thing
I
retained
was
the
education
I
*NL*
received
at
the
North
;
that
was
my
father
's
best
investment
,
and
all
my
*NL*
stock
in
trade
.
With
that
only
as
an
outfit
,
it
would
be
madness
for
me
*NL*
to
think
of
marrying
one
of
those
lovely
girls
.
They
remind
me
of
*NL*
beautiful
canary
birds
,
charming
and
pretty
,
but
not
fitted
for
the
wear
*NL*
and
tear
of
plantation
life
.
Well
,
which
is
your
choice
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Neither
,
''
replied
Eugene
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
is
it
that
magnificent
looking
widow
from
New
Orleans
,
whom
we
*NL*
met
before
you
had
that
terrible
spell
of
sickness
and
to
whom
you
*NL*
appeared
so
devoted
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
.
I
have
not
heard
from
her
since
that
summer
.
She
was
*NL*
fascinating
and
handsome
,
but
fearfully
high
strung
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Were
you
afraid
of
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
but
I
valued
my
happiness
too
much
to
trust
it
in
her
hands
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sour
grapes
!
''
said
Lorraine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
but
I
think
that
slavery
and
the
lack
of
outside
interests
are
*NL*
beginning
to
tell
on
the
lives
of
our
women
.
They
lean
too
much
on
their
*NL*
slaves
,
have
too
much
irresponsible
power
in
their
hands
,
are
narrowed
*NL*
and
compressed
by
the
routine
of
plantation
life
and
the
lack
of
*NL*
intellectual
stimulus
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Eugene
,
when
I
see
what
other
women
are
doing
in
the
fields
of
*NL*
literature
and
art
,
I
can
not
help
thinking
an
amount
of
brain
power
has
*NL*
been
held
in
check
among
us
.
Yet
I
can
not
abide
those
Northern
women
,
*NL*
with
their
suffrage
views
and
abolition
cant
.
They
just
shock
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
your
mother
was
a
Northern
woman
,
''
said
Eugene
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
she
got
bravely
over
her
Northern
ideas
.
As
I
remember
her
,
*NL*
she
was
just
as
much
a
Southerner
as
if
she
had
been
to
the
manor
born
.
*NL*
She
came
here
as
a
school-teacher
,
but
soon
after
she
came
she
married
*NL*
my
father
.
He
was
easy
and
indulgent
with
his
servants
,
and
held
them
*NL*
with
a
very
loose
rein
.
But
my
mother
was
firm
and
energetic
.
She
made
*NL*
the
niggers
move
around
.
No
shirking
nor
dawdling
with
her
.
When
my
*NL*
father
died
,
she
took
matters
in
hand
,
but
she
only
outlived
him
a
few
*NL*
months
.
If
she
had
lived
I
believe
that
she
would
have
retrieved
our
*NL*
fortune
.
I
know
that
she
had
more
executive
ability
than
my
father
.
He
*NL*
was
very
squeamish
about
selling
his
servants
,
but
she
would
have
put
*NL*
every
one
of
them
in
her
pocket
before
permitting
them
to
eat
her
out
of
*NL*
house
and
home
.
But
whom
_
are
_
you
going
to
marry
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
young
lady
who
graduates
from
a
Northern
seminary
next
week

*NL*
responded
Eugene
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
are
very
selfish

said
Lorraine
.
``
You
might
have
invited
*NL*
a
fellow
to
go
with
you
to
be
your
best
man

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
wedding
is
to
be
strictly
private

negro

*NL*
*NL*
``
The

exclaimed
Lorraine
,
starting
to
his

*NL*
looking
incredulously
on
the
face
of
Leroy

``
Never

*NL*
*NL*
``
Right

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Eugene

it
is
impossible
that
you
can
have
an
idea

marrying
one

Why

she
is
your

to
have

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

Although
the

I
never

completely
off

in

here

am

to
lose
caste

I
could
live
with

and
not
incur

any

Society
would
wink
at

*NL*
*NL*
``
Men

Lorraine

``
would
merely
shrug

I
subject

to
social
ostracism

We

Eugene
laid
aside
his
cigar

looked
thoughtfully
at

said
,

not

asking

doing
that
which
seems
to
you
the
*NL*
climax
of
absurdity
,
and
if
you
will
have
the
patience
to
listen
I
will
*NL*
tell
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Proceed
,
I
am
all
attention
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
father
died
,
''
said
Eugene
,
``
as
you
know
,
when
I
was
too
young
to
*NL*
know
his
loss
or
feel
his
care
and
,
being
an
only
child
,
I
was
petted
*NL*
and
spoiled
.
I
grew
up
to
be
wayward
,
self-indulgent
,
proud
,
and
*NL*
imperious
.
I
went
from
home
and
made
many
friends
both
at
college
and
in
*NL*
foreign
lands
.
I
was
well
supplied
with
money
and
,
never
having
been
*NL*
forced
to
earn
it
,
was
ignorant
of
its
value
and
careless
of
its
use
.
My
*NL*
lavish
expenditures
and
liberal
benefactions
attracted
to
me
a
number
*NL*
of
parasites
,
and
men
older
than
myself
led
me
into
the
paths
of
vice
,
*NL*
and
taught
me
how
to
gather
the
flowers
of
sin
which
blossom
around
the
*NL*
borders
of
hell
.
In
a
word
,
I
left
my
home
unwarned
and
unarmed
against
*NL*
the
seductions
of
vice
.
I
returned
an
initiated
devotee
to
debasing
*NL*
pleasures
.
Years
of
my
life
were
passed
in
foreign
lands
;
years
in
which
*NL*
my
soul
slumbered
and
seemed
pervaded
with
a
moral
paralysis
;
years
,
the
*NL*
memory
of
which
fills
my
soul
with
sorrow
and
shame
.
I
went
to
the
*NL*
capitals
of
the
old
world
to
see
life
,
but
in
seeing
life
I
became
*NL*
acquainted
with
death
,
the
death
of
true
manliness
and
self-respect
.
You
*NL*
look
astonished
;
but
I
tell
you
,
Alf
,
there
is
many
a
poor
clod-hopper
,
*NL*
on
whom
are
the
dust
and
grime
of
unremitting
toil
,
who
feels
more
*NL*
self-respect
and
true
manliness
than
many
of
us
with
our
family
*NL*
prestige
,
social
position
,
and
proud
ancestral
halls
.
After
I
had
lived
*NL*
abroad
for
years
,
I
returned
a
broken-down
young
man
,
prematurely
old
,
*NL*
my
constitution
a
perfect
wreck
.
A
life
of
folly
and
dissipation
was
*NL*
telling
fearfully
upon
me
.
My
friends
shrank
from
me
in
dismay
.
I
was
*NL*
sick
nigh
unto
death
,
and
had
it
not
been
for
Marie
's
care
I
am
certain
*NL*
that
I
should
have
died
.
She
followed
me
down
to
the
borders
of
the
*NL*
grave
,
and
won
me
back
to
life
and
health
.
I
was
slow
in
recovering
and
,
*NL*
during
the
time
,
I
had
ample
space
for
reflection
,
and
the
past
unrolled
*NL*
itself
before
me
.
I
resolved
,
over
the
wreck
and
ruin
of
my
past
life
,
*NL*
to
build
a
better
and
brighter
future
.
Marie
had
a
voice
of
remarkable
*NL*
sweetness
,
although
it
lacked
culture
.
Often
when
I
was
nervous
and
*NL*
restless
I
would
have
her
sing
some
of
those
weird
and
plaintive
*NL*
melodies
which
she
had
learned
from
the
plantation
negroes
.
Sometimes
I
*NL*
encouraged
her
to
talk
,
and
I
was
surprised
at
the
native
vigor
of
her
*NL*
intellect
.
By
degrees
I
became
acquainted
with
her
history
.
She
was
all
*NL*
alone
in
the
world
.
She
had
no
recollection
of
her
father
,
but
*NL*
remembered
being
torn
from
her
mother
while
clinging
to
her
dress
.
The
*NL*
trader
who
bought
her
mother
did
not
wish
to
buy
her
.
She
remembered
*NL*
having
a
brother
,
with
whom
she
used
to
play
,
but
she
had
been
separated
*NL*
from
him
also
,
and
since
then
had
lost
all
trace
of
them
.
After
she
was
*NL*
sold
from
her
mother
she
became
the
property
of
an
excellent
old
lady
,
*NL*
who
seems
to
have
been
very
careful
to
imbue
her
mind
with
good
*NL*
principles
;
a
woman
who
loved
purity
,
not
only
for
her
own
daughters
,
*NL*
but
also
for
the
defenseless
girls
in
her
home
.
I
believe
it
was
the
*NL*
lady
's
intention
to
have
freed
Marie
at
her
death
,
but
she
died
*NL*
suddenly
,
and
,
the
estate
being
involved
,
she
was
sold
with
it
and
fell
*NL*
into
the
hands
of
my
agent
.
I
became
deeply
interested
in
her
when
I
*NL*
heard
her
story
,
and
began
to
pity
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
suppose
love
sprang
from
pity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
not
only
pitied
her
,
but
I
learned
to
respect
her
.
I
had
met
with
*NL*
beautiful
women
in
the
halls
of
wealth
and
fashion
,
both
at
home
and
*NL*
abroad
,
but
there
was
something
in
her
different
from
all
my
experience
*NL*
of
womanhood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
so
,
''
said
Lorraine
,
with
a
sneer
;
``
but
I
should
like
to
*NL*
know
what
it
was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
something
such
as
I
have
seen
in
old
cathedrals
,
lighting
up
the
*NL*
beauty
of
a
saintly
face
.
A
light
which
the
poet
tells
was
never
seen
on
*NL*
land
or
sea
.
I
thought
of
this
beautiful
and
defenseless
girl
adrift
in
*NL*
the
power
of
a
reckless
man
,
who
,
with
all
the
advantages
of
wealth
and
*NL*
education
,
had
trailed
his
manhood
in
the
dust
,
and
she
,
with
simple
,
*NL*
childlike
faith
in
the
Unseen
,
seemed
to
be
so
good
and
pure
that
she
*NL*
commanded
my
respect
and
won
my
heart
.
In
her
presence
every
base
and
*NL*
unholy
passion
died
,
subdued
by
the
supremacy
of
her
virtue
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Eugene

what
has
come
over
you

Talking
of
the
virtue

*NL*
quadroon
girls

long

n't
you
know
that
*NL*
these
beautiful
girls
have
been
the
curse
of
our
homes
?
You
have
no
idea
*NL*
of
the
hearts
which
are
wrung
by
their
presence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Alfred
,
suppose
it
is
so
.
Are
they
to
blame
for
it
?
What
can
any
*NL*
woman
do
when
she
is
placed
in
the
hands
of
an
irresponsible
master
;
*NL*
when
she
knows
that
resistance
is
vain
?
Yes
,
Alfred
,
I
agree
with
you
,
*NL*
these
women
are
the
bane
of
our
Southern
civilization
;
but
they
are
the
*NL*
victims
and
we
are
the
criminals
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
from
the
airs
that
some
of
them
put
on
when
they
get
a
chance
,
*NL*
that
they
are
very
willing
victims
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
much
the
worse
for
our
institution
.
If
it
is
cruel
to
debase
a
*NL*
hapless
victim
,
it
is
an
increase
of
cruelty
to
make
her
contented
with
*NL*
her
degradation
.
Let
me
tell
you
,
Alf
,
you
can
not
wrong
or
degrade
a
*NL*
woman
without
wronging
or
degrading
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
with
you
,
Eugene
?
Are
you
thinking
of
taking
*NL*
priest
's
orders

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Alf

''
said
Eugene
,
rising
and
rapidly
pacing
the
floor
,
``
you
may
*NL*
defend
the
system
as
much
as
you
please
,
but
you
can
not
deny
that
the
*NL*
circumstances
it
creates
,
and
the
temptations
it
affords
,
are
sapping
*NL*
our
strength
and
undermining
our
character
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
may
be
true
,
''
said
Lorraine
,
somewhat
irritably
,
``
but
you
had
*NL*
better
be
careful
how
you
air
your
Northern
notions
in
public
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
public
opinion
is
too
sensitive
to
tolerate
any
such
*NL*
discussions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
is
not
that
a
proof
that
we
are
at
fault
with
respect
to
our
*NL*
institutions
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
I
only
know
we
are
living
in
the
midst
of
a
magazine
of
*NL*
powder
,
and
it
is
not
safe
to
enter
it
with
a
lighted
candle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
proceed
with
my
story
,
''
continued
Eugene
.
``
During
the
long
*NL*
months
in
which
I
was
convalescing
,
I
was
left
almost
entirely
to
the
*NL*
companionship
of
Marie
.
In
my
library
I
found
a
Bible
,
which
I
began
to
*NL*
read
from
curiosity
,
but
my
curiosity
deepened
into
interest
when
I
saw
*NL*
the
rapt
expression
on
Marie
's
face
.
I
saw
in
it
a
loving
response
to
*NL*
sentiments
to
which
I
was
a
stranger
.
In
the
meantime
my
conscience
was
*NL*
awakened
,
and
I
scorned
to
take
advantage
of
her
defenselessness
.
I
felt
*NL*
that
I
owed
my
life
to
her
faithful
care
,
and
I
resolved
to
take
her
*NL*
North
,
manumit
,
educate
,
and
marry
her
.
I
sent
her
to
a
Northern
*NL*
academy
,
but
as
soon
as
some
of
the
pupils
found
that
she
was
colored
,
*NL*
objections
were
raised
,
and
the
principal
was
compelled
to
dismiss
her
.
*NL*
During
my
search
for
a
school
I
heard
of
one
where
three
girls
of
mixed
*NL*
blood
were
pursuing
their
studies
,
every
one
of
whom
would
have
been
*NL*
ignominiously
dismissed
had
their
connection
with
the
negro
race
been
*NL*
known
.
But
I
determined
to
run
no
risks
.
I
found
a
school
where
her
*NL*
connection
with
the
negro
race
would
be
no
bar
to
her
advancement
.
She
*NL*
graduates
next
week
,
and
I
intend
to
marry
her
before
I
return
home
.
She
*NL*
was
faithful
when
others
were
faithless
,
stood
by
me
when
others
*NL*
deserted
me
to
die
in
loneliness
and
neglect
,
and
now
I
am
about
to
*NL*
reward
her
care
with
all
the
love
and
devotion
it
is
in
my
power
to
*NL*
bestow
.
That
is
why
I
am
about
to
marry
my
faithful
and
devoted
nurse
,
*NL*
who
snatched
me
from
the
jaws
of
death
.
Now
that
I
have
told
you
my
*NL*
story
,
what
say
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madness
and
folly
inconceivable
!
''
exclaimed
Lorraine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
to
you
is
madness
and
folly
is
perfect
sanity
with
me
.
After
all
,
*NL*
Alf
,
is
there
not
an
amount
of
unreason
in
our
prejudices
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
may
be
true
;
but
I
was
n't
reasoned
into
it
,
and
I
do
not
expect
to
*NL*
be
reasoned
out
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
accompany
me
North
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
except
to
put
you
in
an
insane
asylum
.
You
are
the
greatest
crank
*NL*
out
,
''
said
Lorraine
,
thoroughly
disgusted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
thank
you
;
I
'm
all
right
.
I
expect
to
start
North
to-morrow
.
You
*NL*
had
better
come
and
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
rather
follow
you
to
your
grave
,
''
replied
Lorraine
,
hotly
,
*NL*
while
an
expression
of
ineffable
scorn
passed
over
his
cold
,
proud
face
.

CHAPTER
X.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
SHADOWS
IN
THE
HOME
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
next
morning
after
this
conversation
Leroy
left
for
the
North
,
to
*NL*
attend
the
commencement
and
witness
the
graduation
of
his
ward
.
Arriving
*NL*
in
Ohio
,
he
immediately
repaired
to
the
academy
and
inquired
for
the
*NL*
principal
.
He
was
shown
into
the
reception-room
,
and
in
a
few
moments
*NL*
the
principal
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
morning
,
''
said
Leroy
,
rising
and
advancing
towards
him
;
``
how
is
my
*NL*
ward
this
morning
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
well
,
and
has
been
expecting
you
.
I
am
glad
you
came
in
time
for
*NL*
the
commencement
.
She
stands
among
the
foremost
in
her
class
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
to
hear
it
.
Will
you
send
her
this
?
''
said
Leroy
,
handing
the
*NL*
principal
a
card
.
The
principal
took
the
card
and
immediately
left
the
*NL*
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Very
soon
Leroy
heard
a
light
step
,
and
looking
up
he
saw
a
radiantly
*NL*
beautiful
woman
approaching
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
morning
,
Marie
,
''
he
said
,
greeting
her
cordially
,
and
gazing
upon
*NL*
her
with
unfeigned
admiration
.
``
You
are
looking
very
handsome
this
*NL*
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
so
?
''
she
asked
,
smiling
and
blushing
.
``
I
am
glad
you
are
*NL*
not
disappointed
;
that
you
do
not
feel
your
money
has
been
spent
in
*NL*
vain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
what
I
have
spent
on
your
education
has
been
the
best
*NL*
investment
I
ever
made
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
,
''
said
Marie
,
``
you
may
always
find
it
so
.
But
Mas
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
!
''
said
Leroy
,
laying
his
hand
playfully
on
her
lips
;
``
you
are
*NL*
free
.
I
do
n't
want
the
dialect
of
slavery
to
linger
on
your
lips
.
You
*NL*
must
not
call
me
that
name
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
have
a
nearer
and
dearer
one
by
which
I
wish
to
be
called
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Leroy
drew
her
nearer
,
and
whispered
in
her
ear
a
single
word
.
She
*NL*
started
,
trembled
with
emotion
,
grew
pale
,
and
blushed
painfully
.
An
*NL*
awkward
silence
ensued
,
when
Leroy
,
pressing
her
hand
,
exclaimed
:
``
This
*NL*
is
the
hand
that
plucked
me
from
the
grave
,
and
I
am
going
to
retain
it
*NL*
as
mine
;
mine
to
guard
with
my
care
until
death
us
do
part
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Leroy
looked
earnestly
into
her
eyes
,
which
fell
beneath
his
ardent
*NL*
gaze
.
With
admirable
self-control
,
while
a
great
joy
was
thrilling
her
*NL*
heart
,
she
bowed
her
beautiful
head
and
softly
repeated
,
``
Until
death
us
*NL*
do
part
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Leroy
knew
Southern
society
too
well
to
expect
it
to
condone
his
offense
*NL*
against
its
social
customs
,
or
give
the
least
recognition
to
his
wife
,
*NL*
however
cultured
,
refined
,
and
charming
she
might
be
,
if
it
were
known
*NL*
that
she
had
the
least
infusion
of
negro
blood
in
her
veins
.
But
he
was
*NL*
brave
enough
to
face
the
consequences
of
his
alliance
,
and
marry
the
*NL*
woman
who
was
the
choice
of
his
heart
,
and
on
whom
his
affections
were
*NL*
centred
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
Leroy
had
left
the
room
,
Marie
sat
awhile
thinking
of
the
*NL*
wonderful
change
that
had
come
over
her
.
Instead
of
being
a
lonely
slave
*NL*
girl
,
with
the
fatal
dower
of
beauty
,
liable
to
be
bought
and
sold
,
*NL*
exchanged
,
and
bartered
,
she
was
to
be
the
wife
of
a
wealthy
planter
;
a
*NL*
man
in
whose
honor
she
could
confide
,
and
on
whose
love
she
could
lean
.
*NL*
*NL*
Very
interesting
and
pleasant
were
the
commencement
exercises
in
which
*NL*
Marie
bore
an
important
part
.
To
enlist
sympathy
for
her
enslaved
race
,
*NL*
and
appear
to
advantage
before
Leroy
,
had
aroused
all
of
her
energies
.
*NL*
The
stimulus
of
hope
,
the
manly
love
which
was
environing
her
life
,
*NL*
brightened
her
eye
and
lit
up
the
wonderful
beauty
of
her
countenance
.
*NL*
During
her
stay
in
the
North
she
had
constantly
been
brought
in
contact
*NL*
with
anti-slavery
people
.
She
was
not
aware
that
there
was
so
much
*NL*
kindness
among
the
white
people
of
the
country
until
she
had
tested
it
*NL*
in
the
North
.
From
the
anti-slavery
people
in
private
life
she
had
*NL*
learned
some
of
the
noblest
lessons
of
freedom
and
justice
,
and
had
*NL*
become
imbued
with
their
sentiments
.
Her
theme
was
``
American
*NL*
Civilization
,
its
Lights
and
Shadows
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Graphically
she
portrayed
the
lights
,
faithfully
she
showed
the
shadows
*NL*
of
our
American
civilization
.
Earnestly
and
feelingly
she
spoke
of
the
*NL*
blind
Sampson
in
our
land
,
who
might
yet
shake
the
pillars
of
our
great
*NL*
Commonwealth
.
Leroy
listened
attentively
.
At
times
a
shadow
of
annoyance
*NL*
would
overspread
his
face
,
but
it
was
soon
lost
in
the
admiration
her
*NL*
earnestness
and
zeal
inspired
.
Like
Esther
pleading
for
the
lives
of
her
*NL*
people
in
the
Oriental
courts
of
a
despotic
king
,
she
stood
before
the
*NL*
audience
,
pleading
for
those
whose
lips
were
sealed
,
but
whose
condition
*NL*
appealed
to
the
mercy
and
justice
of
the
Nation
.
Strong
men
wiped
the
*NL*
moisture
from
their
eyes
,
and
women
's
hearts
throbbed
in
unison
with
the
*NL*
strong
,
brave
words
that
were
uttered
in
behalf
of
freedom
for
all
and
*NL*
chains
for
none
.
Generous
applause
was
freely
bestowed
,
and
beautiful
*NL*
bouquets
were
showered
upon
her
.
When
it
was
known
that
she
was
to
be
*NL*
the
wife
of
her
guardian
,
warm
congratulations
were
given
,
and
earnest
*NL*
hopes
expressed
for
the
welfare
of
the
lonely
girl
,
who
,
nearly
all
her
*NL*
life
,
had
been
deprived
of
a
parent
's
love
and
care
.
On
the
eve
of
*NL*
starting
South
Leroy
procured
a
license
,
and
united
his
destiny
with
the
*NL*
young
lady
whose
devotion
in
the
darkest
hour
had
won
his
love
and
*NL*
gratitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
few
days
Marie
returned
as
mistress
to
the
plantation
from
which
*NL*
she
had
gone
as
a
slave
.
But
as
unholy
alliances
were
common
in
those
*NL*
days
between
masters
and
slaves
,
no
one
took
especial
notice
that
Marie
*NL*
shared
Leroy
's
life
as
mistress
of
his
home
,
and
that
the
family
silver
*NL*
and
jewelry
were
in
her
possession
.
But
Leroy
,
happy
in
his
choice
,
*NL*
attended
to
the
interests
of
his
plantation
,
and
found
companionship
in
*NL*
his
books
and
in
the
society
of
his
wife
.
A
few
male
companions
visited
*NL*
him
occasionally
,
admired
the
magnificent
beauty
of
his
wife
,
shook
*NL*
their
heads
,
and
spoke
of
him
as
being
very
eccentric
,
but
thought
his
*NL*
marriage
the
great
mistake
of
his
life
.
But
none
of
his
female
friends
*NL*
ever
entered
his
doors
,
when
it
became
known
that
Marie
held
the
*NL*
position
of
mistress
of
his
mansion
,
and
presided
at
his
table
.
But
she
,
*NL*
sheltered
in
the
warm
clasp
of
loving
arms
,
found
her
life
like
a
joyous
*NL*
dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
Into
that
quiet
and
beautiful
home
three
children
were
born
,
unconscious
*NL*
of
the
doom
suspended
over
their
heads
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
how
glad
I
am
,
''
Marie
would
often
say
,
``
that
these
children
are
*NL*
free
.
I
could
never
understand
how
a
cultured
white
man
could
have
his
*NL*
own
children
enslaved
.
I
can
understand
how
savages
,
fighting
with
each
*NL*
other
,
could
doom
their
vanquished
foes
to
slavery
,
but
it
has
always
*NL*
been
a
puzzle
to
me
how
a
civilized
man
could
drag
his
own
children
,
*NL*
bone
of
his
bone
,
flesh
of
his
flesh
,
down
to
the
position
of
social
*NL*
outcasts
,
abject
slaves
,
and
political
pariahs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Marie
,
''
said
Eugene
,
``
all
men
do
not
treat
their
illegitimate
*NL*
children
in
the
manner
you
describe
.
The
last
time
I
was
in
New
Orleans
*NL*
I
met
Henri
Augustine
at
the
depot
,
with
two
beautiful
young
girls
.
At
*NL*
first
I
thought
that
they
were
his
own
children
,
they
resembled
him
so
*NL*
closely
.
But
afterwards
I
noticed
that
they
addressed
him
as
`
Mister
.
'
*NL*
Before
we
parted
he
told
me
that
his
wife
had
taken
such
a
dislike
to
*NL*
their
mother
that
she
could
not
bear
to
see
them
on
the
place
.
At
last
,
*NL*
weary
of
her
dissatisfaction
,
he
had
promised
to
bring
them
to
New
*NL*
Orleans
and
sell
them
.
Instead
,
he
was
going
to
Ohio
to
give
them
their
*NL*
freedom
,
and
make
provision
for
their

``
What
a

said
Marie

*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
was
wronged
?
''
said
Leroy
,
in
astonishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Every
one
in
the
whole
transaction
,
''
answered
Marie
.
``
Your
friend
*NL*
wronged
himself
by
sinning
against
his
own
soul
.
He
wronged
his
wife
by
*NL*
arousing
her
hatred
and
jealousy
through
his
unfaithfulness
.
He
wronged
*NL*
those
children
by
giving
them
the
_
status
_
of
slaves
and
outcasts
.
He
*NL*
wronged
their
mother
by
imposing
upon
her
the
burdens
and
cares
of
*NL*
maternity
without
the
rights
and
privileges
of
a
wife
.
He
made
her
crown
*NL*
of
motherhood
a
circlet
of
shame
.
Under
other
circumstances
she
might
*NL*
have
been
an
honored
wife
and
happy
mother
.
And
I
do
think
such
men
*NL*
wrong
their
own
legitimate
children
by
transmitting
to
them
a
weakened
*NL*
moral
fibre
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Marie
,
you
have
such
an
uncomfortable
way
of
putting
things
.
You
*NL*
make
me
feel
that
we
have
done
those
things
which
we
ought
not
to
have
*NL*
done
,
and
have
left
undone
those
things
which
we
ought
to
have
done

*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
annoys
you

``
I

stop
talking

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no

go
on
,

said
Leroy
,
carelessly
;
and
then
he
continued
more
*NL*
thoughtfully
,
``
I
know
a
number
of
men
who
have
sent
such
children
North
,
*NL*
and
manumitted

and
left
them
valuable
legacies
.
We
are
all
*NL*
liable
to
err
,
and
,
having
done
wrong
,
all
we
can
do
is
to
make
*NL*
reparation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
husband
,
this
is
a
wrong
where
reparation
is
impossible
.
*NL*
Neither
wealth
nor
education
can
repair
the
wrong
of
a
dishonored
birth
.
*NL*
There
are
a
number
of
slaves
in
this
section
who
are
servants
to
their
*NL*
own
brothers
and
sisters
;
whose
fathers
have
robbed
them
not
simply
of
*NL*
liberty
but
of
the
right
of
being
well
born
.
Do
you
think
these
things
*NL*
will
last
forever

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
not

There
are
some
prophets
of
evil
who
tell
us
that
the
*NL*
Union
is
going
to
dissolve
.
But
I
know
it
would
puzzle
their
brains
to
*NL*
tell
where
the
crack
will
begin

I
reckon
we

continue

*NL*
*NL*
Even
while
Leroy
dreamed
of
safety
the
earthquake
was
cradling
its
fire
;
*NL*
the
ground
was
growing
hollow
beneath
his
tread
;
but
his
ear
was
too
*NL*
dull
to
catch
the
sound
;
his
vision
too
blurred
to
read
the
signs
of
the
*NL*
times

*NL*
*NL*
``
Marie

''
said
Leroy
,
taking
up
the
thread
of
the
discourse
,
``
slavery
is
*NL*
a
sword
that
cuts
both
ways

If
it
wrongs
the

it
also
curses

Get
out

*NL*
``
That

easier

I
would
willingly
free
every

I
could
do
so
without
expatriating
them

Some
of
them
have
*NL*
wives
and
children
on
other
plantations
,
and
to
free
them
is
to
separate
*NL*
them
from
their
kith
and
kin

To
let
them
remain
here
as
a
free
people
*NL*
is
out
of
the
question

My
hands
are
tied
by
law

*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
tied
them

''
asked
Marie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
public
opinion
,
whose

I
can
not
break

If
the

is
the

we

just

not
battle
against

``
Because
I
have
neither
the
courage

so
I
drift
along
,
trying
to
make
the
condition
of
our

*NL*
as
comfortable
as
I
possibly
can

I
believe
there
are
slaves
on
this

most
flattering

away

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not

said
Marie

``
that
some

Lying

The

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do

I

and
the
scornful
glances
which

even
now

I

are
leveled
at

Yesterday
Harry

crying

*NL*
A
shadow
flitted
over
Leroy

he
answered

somewhat
soberly
,
*NL*
``
Oh

``

colored
woman
are
in

was
bitterly
opposed
to

and

would
not
trust
any

important
interests
in

I
do
hope

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
said
Marie
,
pressing
to
her
heart
a
beautiful
child
of
six
*NL*
summers
,
``
I
think
it
would
almost
make
me
turn
over
in
my
grave
to
know
*NL*
that
every
grace
and
charm
which
this
child
possesses
would
only
be
so
*NL*
much
added
to
her
value
as
an
article
of
merchandise

''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Marie
released
the
child
from
her
arms
she
looked
wonderingly
into
*NL*
her
mother
's
face
and
clung
closely
to
her
,
as
if
to
find
refuge
from
*NL*
some
unseen
evil
.
Leroy
noticed
this
,
and
sighed
unconsciously
,
as
an
*NL*
expression
of
pain
flitted
over
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Marie
,
''
he
continued
,
``
stop
tormenting
yourself
with
useless
*NL*
fears

Although

with
all
her
faults

I
still
love
the
South
,
I
will
*NL*
make
arrangements
either
to
live
North
or
go
to
France

There
life
will
*NL*
be
brighter
for
us
all

Now
,
Marie

seat
yourself
at
the
piano
and
*NL*
sing
:

*NL*
*NL*
`
Sing

*NL*
Long

long

*NL*
As
Marie
sang
the
anxiety
faded
from
her
face
,
a
sense
of
security
stole
*NL*
over
her
,
and
she
sat
among
her
loved
ones
a
happy
wife
and
mother
.
What
*NL*
if
no
one
recognized
her
on
that
lonely
plantation
!
Her
world
was
,
*NL*
nevertheless
,
there
.
The
love
and
devotion
of
her
husband
brightened
*NL*
every
avenue
of
her
life
,
while
her
children
filled
her
home
with
music
,
*NL*
mirth
,
and
sunshine
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marie
had
undertaken
their
education
,
but
she
could
not
give
them
the
*NL*
culture
which
comes
from
the
attrition
of
thought
,
and
from
contact
with
*NL*
the
ideas
of
others
.
Since
her
school-days
she
had
read
extensively
and
*NL*
thought
much
,
and
in
solitude
her
thoughts
had
ripened
.
But
for
her
*NL*
children
there
were
no
companions
except
the
young
slaves
of
the
*NL*
plantation
,
and
she
dreaded
the
effect
of
such
intercourse
upon
their
*NL*
lives
and
characters
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leroy
had
always
been
especially
careful
to
conceal
from
his
children
*NL*
the
knowledge
of
their
connection
with
the
negro
race
.
To
Marie
this
*NL*
silence
was
oppressive
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
she
said
to
him
,
``
I
see
no
other
way
of
finishing
the
education
*NL*
of
these
children
than
by
sending
them
to
some
Northern
school
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
come
,
''
said
Leroy
,
``
to
the
same
conclusion

We
had
better
take
*NL*
Iola
and
Harry
North
and
make
arrangements
for
them
to
spend
several
*NL*
years
in
being
educated
.
Riches
take
wings
to
themselves
and
fly
away
,
*NL*
but
a
good
education
is
an
investment
on
which
the
law
can
place
no
*NL*
attachment
.
As
there
is
a
possibility
of
their
origin
being
discovered
,
*NL*
I
will
find
a
teacher
to
whom
I
can
confide
our
story
,
and
upon
whom
I
*NL*
can
enjoin
secrecy
.
I
want
them
well
fitted
for
any
emergency
in
life
.
*NL*
When
I
discover
for
what
they
have
the
most
aptitude

will
give
them
*NL*
especial
training

*NL*
A
troubled
look
passed
over
the
face
of

,
as
she
hesitatingly
said
:
*NL*
``

am
so
afraid

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

Leroy
,
tenderly
,
``

I
do
not

which
no

that
any
social
advancement

individual
development

wipe
off

clings
to
them

No

will
come
all

soon

grow
up

prejudice

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know

said
Marie
,
sadly
,
``
and
I
think
one
of
the
great
mistakes

social
test

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

develop

courage

I
had
an
opportunity
to
see
and
hear
of
men
*NL*
of
African
descent
who
had
distinguished
themselves
and
obtained
a
*NL*
recognition
in
European
circles
,
which
they
never
could
have
gained
in
*NL*
this
country
.
I
now
recall
the
name
of
Ira
Aldridge
,
a
colored
man
from
*NL*
New
York
City
,
who
was
covered
with
princely
honors
as
a
successful
*NL*
tragedian
.
Alexander
Dumas
was
not
forced
to
conceal
his
origin
to
*NL*
succeed
as
a
novelist
.
When
I
was
in
St.
Petersburg
I
was
shown
the
*NL*
works
of
Alexander
Sergevitch
,
a
Russian
poet
,
who
was
spoken
of
as
the
*NL*
Byron
of
Russian
literature
,
and
reckoned
one
of
the
finest
poets
that
*NL*
Russia
has
produced
in
this
century
.
He
was
also
a
prominent
figure
in
*NL*
fashionable
society
,
and
yet
he
was
of
African
lineage
.
One
of
his
*NL*
paternal
ancestors
was
a
negro
who
had
been
ennobled
by
Peter
the
*NL*
Great
.
I
ca
n't
help
contrasting
the
recognition
which
these
men
had
*NL*
received
with
the
treatment
which
has
been
given
to
Frederick
Douglass
*NL*
and
other
intelligent
colored
men
in
this
country
.
With
me
the
wonder
is
*NL*
not
that
they
have
achieved
so
little
,
but
that
they
have
accomplished
*NL*
so
much
.
No
,
Marie
,
we
will
have
our
children
educated
without
being
*NL*
subjected
to
the
depressing
influences
of
caste
feeling
.
Perhaps
by
the
*NL*
time
their
education
is
finished
I
will
be
ready
to
wind
up
my
affairs
*NL*
and
take
them
abroad
,
where
merit
and
ability
will
give
them
entrance
*NL*
into
the
best
circles
of
art
,
literature
,
and
science
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
conversation
Leroy
and
his
wife
went
North
,
and
succeeded
in
*NL*
finding
a
good
school
for
their
children
.
In
a
private
interview
he
*NL*
confided
to
the
principal
the
story
of
the
cross
in
their
blood
,
and
,
*NL*
finding
him
apparently
free
from
racial
prejudice
,
he
gladly
left
the
*NL*
children
in
his
care
.
Gracie
,
the
youngest
child
,
remained
at
home
,
and
*NL*
her
mother
spared
no
pains
to
fit
her
for
the
seminary
against
the
time
*NL*
her
sister
should
have
finished
her
education
.

CHAPTER
XI
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
THE
PLAGUE
AND
THE
LAW
.
*NL*
*NL*
Years
passed
,
bringing
no
special
change
to
the
life
of
Leroy
and
his
*NL*
wife
.
Shut
out
from
the
busy
world
,
its
social
cares
and
anxieties
,
*NL*
Marie
's
life
flowed
peacefully
on
.
Although
removed
by
the
protecting
*NL*
care
of
Leroy
from
the
condition
of
servitude
,
she
still
retained
a
deep
*NL*
sympathy
for
the
enslaved
,
and
was
ever
ready
to
devise
plans
to
*NL*
ameliorate
their
condition
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leroy
,
although
in
the
midst
of
slavery
,
did
not
believe
in
the
*NL*
rightfulness
of
the
institution
.
He
was
in
favor
of
gradual
*NL*
emancipation
,
which
would
prepare
both
master
and
slave
for
a
moral
*NL*
adaptation
to
the
new
conditions
of
freedom
.
While
he
was
willing
to
*NL*
have
the
old
rivets
taken
out
of
slavery
,
politicians
and
planters
were
*NL*
devising
plans
to
put
in
new
screws
.
He
was
desirous
of
having
it
ended
*NL*
in
the
States
;
they
were
clamorous
to
have
it
established
in
the
*NL*
Territories
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
so
strong
was
the
force
of
habit
,
combined
with
the
feebleness
of
*NL*
his
moral
resistance
and
the
nature
of
his
environment
,
that
instead
of
*NL*
being
an
athlete
,
armed
for
a
glorious
strife
,
he
had
learned
to
drift
*NL*
where
he
should
have
steered
,
to
float
with
the
current
instead
of
nobly
*NL*
breasting
the
tide
.
He
conducted
his
plantation
with
as
much
lenity
as
*NL*
it
was
possible
to
infuse
into
a
system
darkened
with
the
shadow
of
a
*NL*
million
crimes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leroy
had
always
been
especially
careful
not
to
allow
his
children
to
*NL*
spend
their
vacations
at
home
.
He
and
Marie
generally
spent
that
time
*NL*
with
them
at
some
summer
resort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
like
,
''
said
Marie
,
one
day
,
``
to
have
our
children
spend
their
*NL*
vacations
at
home
.
Those
summer
resorts
are
pleasant
,
yet
,
after
all
,
*NL*
there
is
no
place
like
home
.
But
,
''
and
her
voice
became
tremulous
,
``
our
*NL*
children
would
now
notice
their
social
isolation
and
inquire
the
cause
.
''
*NL*
A
faint
sigh
arose
to
the
lips
of
Leroy
,
as
she
added
:
``
Man
is
a
social
*NL*
being
;
I
've
known
it
to
my
sorrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
tone
of
sadness
in
Leroy
's
voice
,
as
he
replied
:
``
Yes
,
*NL*
Marie
,
let
them
stay
North
.
We
seem
to
be
entering
on
a
period
fraught
*NL*
with
great
danger
.
I
can
not
help
thinking
and
fearing
that
we
are
on
the
*NL*
eve
of
a
civil
war
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
civil
war
!
''
exclaimed
Marie
,
with
an
air
of
astonishment
.
``
A
civil
*NL*
war
about
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Marie
,
the
thing
looks
to
me
so
wild
and
foolish
I
hardly
know
how
*NL*
to
explain
.
But
some
of
our
leading
men
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
*NL*
North
and
South
had
better
separate
,
and
instead
of
having
one
to
have
*NL*
two
independent
governments
.
The
spirit
of
secession
is
rampant
in
the
*NL*
land
.
I
do
not
know
what
the
result
will
be
,
and
I
fear
it
will
bode
no
*NL*
good
to
the
country
.
Between
the
fire-eating
Southerners
and
the
*NL*
meddling
Abolitionists
we
are
about
to
be
plunged
into
a
great
deal
of
*NL*
trouble
.
I
fear
there
are
breakers
ahead
.
The
South
is
dissatisfied
with
*NL*
the
state
of
public
opinion
in
the
North
.
We
are
realizing
that
we
are
*NL*
two
peoples
in
the
midst
of
one
nation
.
William
H.
Seward
has
*NL*
proclaimed
that
the
conflict
between
freedom
and
slavery
is
*NL*
irrepressible
,
and
that
the
country
can
not
remain
half
free
and
half
*NL*
slave
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
will
_
you
_
go
?
''
asked
Marie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
heart
is
with
the
Union
.
I
do
n't
believe
in
secession
.
There
has
*NL*
been
no
cause
sufficient
to
justify
a
rupture
.
The
North
has
met
us
time
*NL*
and
again
in
the
spirit
of
concession
and
compromise
.
When
we
wanted
the
*NL*
continuance
of
the
African
slave
trade
the
North
conceded
that
we
should
*NL*
have
twenty
years
of
slave-trading
for
the
benefit
of
our
plantations
.
*NL*
When
we
wanted
more
territory
she
conceded
to
our
desires
and
gave
us
*NL*
land
enough
to
carve
out
four
States
,
and
there
yet
remains
enough
for
*NL*
four
more
.
When
we
wanted
power
to
recapture
our
slaves
when
they
fled
*NL*
North
for
refuge
,
Daniel
Webster
told
Northerners
to
conquer
their
*NL*
prejudices
,
and
they
gave
us
the
whole
Northern
States
as
a
hunting
*NL*
ground
for
our
slaves
.
The
Presidential
chair
has
been
filled
the
*NL*
greater
number
of
years
by
Southerners
,
and
the
majority
of
offices
has
*NL*
been
shared
by
our
men
.
We
wanted
representation
in
Congress
on
a
basis
*NL*
which
would
include
our
slaves
,
and
the
North
,
whose
suffrage
represents
*NL*
only
men
,
gave
us
a
three-fifths
representation
for
our
slaves
,
whom
we
*NL*
count
as
property
.
I
think
the
step
will
be
suicidal
.
There
are
*NL*
extremists
in
both
sections
,
but
I
hope
,
between
them
both
,
wise
*NL*
counsels
and
measures
will
prevail
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Just
then
Alfred
Lorraine
was
ushered
into
the
room
.
Occasionally
he
*NL*
visited
Leroy
,
but
he
always
came
alone
.
His
wife
was
the
only
daughter
*NL*
of
an
enterprising
slave-trader
,
who
had
left
her
a
large
amount
of
*NL*
property
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
social
training
was
deficient
,
her
education
limited
,
but
she
was
*NL*
too
proud
of
being
a
pure
white
woman
to
enter
the
home
of
Leroy
,
with
*NL*
Marie
as
its
presiding
genius
.
Lorraine
tolerated
Marie
's
presence
as
a
*NL*
necessary
evil
,
while
to
her
he
always
seemed
like
a
presentiment
of
*NL*
trouble
.
With
his
coming
a
shadow
fell
upon
her
home
,
hushing
its
music
*NL*
and
darkening
its
sunshine
.
A
sense
of
dread
oppressed
her
.
There
came
*NL*
into
her
soul
an
intuitive
feeling
that
somehow
his
coming
was
fraught
*NL*
with
danger
.
When
not
peering
around
she
would
often
catch
his
eyes
bent
*NL*
on
her
with
a
baleful
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leroy
and
his
cousin
immediately
fell
into
a
discussion
on
the
condition
*NL*
of
the
country
.
Lorraine
was
a
rank
Secessionist
,
ready
to
adopt
the
*NL*
most
extreme
measures
of
the
leaders
of
the
movement
,
even
to
the
*NL*
reopening
of
the
slave
trade
.
Leroy
thought
a
dissolution
of
the
Union
*NL*
would
involve
a
fearful
expenditure
of
blood
and
treasure
for
which
,
*NL*
before
the
eyes
of
the
world
,
there
could
be
no
justification
.
The
*NL*
debate
lasted
late
into
the
night
,
leaving
both
Lorraine
and
Leroy
just
*NL*
as
set
in
their
opinions
as
they
were
before
they
began
.
Marie
listened
*NL*
attentively
awhile
,
then
excused
herself
and
withdrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
Lorraine
had
gone
Marie
said
:
``
There
is
something
about
your
*NL*
cousin
that
fills
me
with
nameless
dread
.
I
always
feel
when
he
enters
*NL*
the
room
as
if
some
one
were
walking
over
my
grave
.
I
do
wish
he
would
*NL*
stay
at
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
so
,
too
,
since
he
disturbs
you
.
But
,
Marie
,
you
are
growing
*NL*
nervous
.
How
cold
your
hands
are
.
Do
n't
you
feel
well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
;
I
am
only
a
little
faint
.
I
wish
he
would
never
come
.
But
,
as
*NL*
he
does
,
I
must
make
the
best
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Marie
,
treat
him
well
for
my
sake
.
He
is
the
only
relative
I
have
*NL*
who
ever
darkens
our
doors
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
faith
in
his
friendship
for
either
myself
or
my
children
.
I
*NL*
feel
that
while
he
makes
himself
agreeable
to
you
he
hates
me
from
the
*NL*
bottom
of
his
heart
,
and
would
do
anything
to
get
me
out
of
the
way
.
Oh
,
*NL*
I
am
_
so
_
glad
I
am
your
lawful
wife
,
and
that
you
married
me
before
you
*NL*
brought
me
back
to
this
State
!
I
believe
that
if
you
were
gone
he
*NL*
would
n't
have
the
least
scruple
against
trying
to
prove
our
marriage
*NL*
invalid
and
remanding
us
to
slavery
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Leroy
looked
anxiously
and
soberly
at
his
wife
,
and
said
:
``
Marie
,
I
do
*NL*
not
think
so

Your
life
is
too
lonely
here

Write
your
orders
to
New
*NL*
Orleans
,
get
what
you
need
for
the
journey
,
and
let
us
spend
the
summer
*NL*
somewhere
in
the
North
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Just
then
Marie
's
attention
was
drawn
to
some
household
matters
,
and
it
*NL*
was
a
short
time
before
she
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom

''
continued
Leroy
,
``
has
just
brought
the
mail
,
and
here
is
a
letter
*NL*
from
Iola
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marie
noticed
that
he
looked
quite
sober
as
he
read
,
and
that
an
*NL*
expression
of
vexation
was
lingering
on
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
?
''
asked
Marie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
much
;
only
a
tempest
in
a
teapot
.
The
presence
of
a
colored
*NL*
girl
in
Mr.
Galen
's
school
has
caused
a
breeze
of
excitement
.
You
know
*NL*
Mr.
Galen
is
quite
an
Abolitionist
,
and
,
being
true
to
his
principles
,
*NL*
he
could
not
consistently
refuse
when
a
colored
woman
applied
for
her
*NL*
daughter
's
admission
.
Of
course
,
when
he
took
her
he
was
compelled
to
*NL*
treat
her
as
any
other
pupil
.
In
so
doing
he
has
given
mortal
offense
to
*NL*
the
mother
of
two
Southern
boys

She
has
threatened
to
take
them
away
if

the
colored
girl
remains

``
What
will

asked
Marie

thoughtfully

*NL*
``
Oh

it
is
a
bitter
pill

I

he
will
have
to
swallow
it

between
two
fires

He
can
not
dismiss
her
from
the
school

be
true
to
*NL*
his
Abolition
principles

yet
if
he
retains
her
he
will
lose
his

Southern

I

``
He
has
found
another

No

*NL*
*NL*
Leroy

always
liberal
with
his

spared
neither
pains

nor
expense
to
have
them
prepared
for
their
summer
outing

Iola

In
a
few
days
Leroy
and
his
wife
started
*NL*
North
,
but
before
they
reached
Vicksburg
they
were
met
by
the
*NL*
intelligence
that
the
yellow
fever
was
spreading
in
the
Delta
,
and
that
*NL*
pestilence
was
breathing
its
bane
upon
the
morning
air
and
distilling
*NL*
its
poison
upon
the
midnight
dews
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
return
home
,
''
said
Marie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
useless
,
''
answered
Leroy
.
``
It
is
nearly
two
days
since
we
left
*NL*
home
.
The
fever
is
spreading
south
of
us
with
fearful
rapidity
.
To
*NL*
return
home
is
to
walk
into
the
jaws
of
death
.
It
was
my
intention
to
*NL*
have
stopped
at
Vicksburg
,
but
now
I
will
go
on
as
soon
as
I
can
make
*NL*
the
connections
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Early
next
morning
Leroy
and
his
wife
started
again
on
their
journey
.
*NL*
The
cars
were
filled
with
terror-stricken
people
who
were
fleeing
from
*NL*
death
,
when
death
was
everywhere
.
They
fled
from
the
city
only
to
meet
*NL*
the
dreaded
apparition
in
the
country
.
As
they
journeyed
on
Leroy
grew
*NL*
restless
and
feverish
.
He
tried
to
brace
himself
against
the
infection
*NL*
which
was
creeping
slowly
but
insidiously
into
his
life
,
dulling
his
*NL*
brain
,
fevering
his
blood
,
and
prostrating
his
strength
.
But
vain
were
*NL*
all
his
efforts
.
He
had
no
armor
strong
enough
to
repel
the
invasion
of
*NL*
death
.
They
stopped
at
a
small
town
on
the
way
and
obtained
the
best
*NL*
medical
skill
and
most
careful
nursing
,
but
neither
skill
nor
art
*NL*
availed
.
On
the
third
day
death
claimed
Leroy
as
a
victim
,
and
Marie
*NL*
wept
in
hopeless
agony
over
the
grave
of
her
devoted
husband
,
whose
sad
*NL*
lot
it
was
to
die
from
home
and
be
buried
among
strangers
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
before
he
died
he
placed
his
will
in
Marie
's
hands
,
saying
:
``
I
have
*NL*
left
you
well
provided
for
.
Kiss
the
children
for
me
and
bid
them
*NL*
good-bye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
tried
to
say
a
parting
word
to
Gracie
,
but
his
voice
failed
,
and
he
*NL*
fainted
into
the
stillness
of
death
.
A
mortal
paleness
overspread
his
*NL*
countenance
,
on
which
had
already
gathered
the
shadows
that
never
*NL*
deceive
.
In
speechless
agony
Marie
held
his
hand
until
it
released
its
*NL*
pressure
in
death
,
and
then
she
stood
alone
beside
her
dead
,
with
all
*NL*
the
bright
sunshine
of
her
life
fading
into
the
shadows
of
the
grave
.
*NL*
Heart-broken
and
full
of
fearful
forebodings
,
Marie
left
her
cherished
*NL*
dead
in
the
quiet
village
of
H
--
and
returned
to
her
death-darkened
*NL*
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
lovely
day
in
June
,
birds
were
singing
their
sweetest
songs
,
*NL*
flowers
were
breathing
their
fragrance
on
the
air
,
when
Mam
Liza
,
*NL*
sitting
at
her
cabin-door
,
talking
with
some
of
the
house
servants
,
saw
*NL*
a
carriage
approaching
,
and
wondered
who
was
coming
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
,
''
she
said
,
excitedly
,
``
whose
comin
'
to
de
house
when
de
folks
*NL*
is
done
gone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
her
surprise
was
soon
changed
to
painful
amazement
,
when
she
saw
*NL*
Marie
,
robed
in
black
,
alighting
from
the
carriage
,
and
holding
Gracie
*NL*
by
the
hand
.
She
caught
sight
of
the
drooping
head
and
grief-stricken
*NL*
face
,
and
rushed
to
her
,
exclaiming
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whar
's
Marse
Eugene
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dead
,
''
said
Marie
,
falling
into
Mammy
Liza
's
arms
,
sobbing
out
,
``
dead
!
*NL*
_
died
_
of
yellow
fever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
wild
burst
of
sorrow
came
from
the
lips
of
the
servants
,
who
had
*NL*
drawn
near
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
he
?
''
said
Mam
Liza
,
speaking
like
one
suddenly
bewildered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
buried
in
H
--
.
I
could
not
bring
him
home
,
''
said
Marie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
pore
baby
,
''
said
Mam
Liza
,
with
broken
sobs
.
``
I
`
se
drefful
sorry
.
My
*NL*
heart
's
most
broke
into
two
.
''
Then
,
controlling
herself
,
she
dismissed
*NL*
the
servants
who
stood
around
,
weeping
,
and
led
Marie
to
her
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
honey
,
lie
down
an
'
lem
`
me
git
yer
a
cup
ob
tea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
;
I
do
n't
want
anything
,
''
said
Marie
,
wringing
her
hands
in
*NL*
bitter
agony
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
honey
,
''
said
Mam
Liza
,
``
yer
mus
n't
gib
up
.
Yer
knows
whar
to
put
*NL*
yer
trus
'
.
Yer
ca
n't
lean
on
de
arm
of
flesh
in
dis
tryin
'
time
.
''
*NL*
Kneeling
by
the
side
of
her
mistress
she
breathed
out
a
prayer
full
of
*NL*
tenderness
,
hope
,
and
trust
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marie
grew
calmer
.
It
seemed
as
if
that
earnest
,
trustful
prayer
had
*NL*
breathed
into
her
soul
a
feeling
of
resignation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gracie
stood
wonderingly
by
,
vainly
trying
to
comprehend
the
great
*NL*
sorrow
which
was
overwhelming
the
life
of
her
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
first
great
burst
of
sorrow
was
over
,
Marie
sat
down
to
her
*NL*
desk
and
wrote
a
letter
to
Iola
,
informing
her
of
her
father
's
death
.
By
*NL*
the
time
she
had
finished
it
she
grew
dizzy
and
faint
,
and
fell
into
a
*NL*
swoon
.
Mammy
Liza
tenderly
laid
her
on
the
bed
,
and
helped
restore
her
*NL*
to
consciousness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lorraine
,
having
heard
of
his
cousin
's
death
,
came
immediately
to
see
*NL*
Marie
.
She
was
too
ill
to
have
an
interview
with
him
,
but
he
picked
up
*NL*
the
letter
she
had
written
and
obtained
Iola
's
address
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lorraine
made
a
careful
investigation
of
the
case
,
to
ascertain
whether
*NL*
Marie
's
marriage
was
valid
.
To
his
delight
he
found
there
was
a
flaw
in
*NL*
the
marriage
and
an
informality
in
the
manumission
.
He
then
determined
*NL*
to
invalidate
Marie
's
claim
,
and
divide
the
inheritance
among
Leroy
's
*NL*
white
relations
.
In
a
short
time
strangers
,
distant
relatives
of
her
*NL*
husband
,
became
frequent
visitors
at
the
plantation
,
and
made
themselves
*NL*
offensively
familiar
.
At
length
the
dreadful
storm
burst
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alfred
Lorraine
entered
suit
for
his
cousin
's
estate
,
and
for
the
*NL*
remanding
of
his
wife
and
children
to
slavery
.
In
a
short
time
he
came
*NL*
armed
with
legal
authority
,
and
said
to
Marie
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
come
to
take
possession
of
these
premises
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
what
authority
?
''
she
gasped
,
turning
deathly
pale
.
He
hesitated
a
*NL*
moment
,
as
if
his
words
were
arrested
by
a
sense
of
shame
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
what
authority
?
''
she
again
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
authority
of
the
law
,
''
answered
Lorraine
,
``
which
has
decided
*NL*
that
Leroy
's
legal
heirs
are
his
white
blood
relations
,
and
that
your
*NL*
marriage
is
null
and
void
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
exclaimed
Marie
,
``
I
have
our
marriage
certificate
.
I
was
Leroy
's
*NL*
lawful
wife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
marriage
certificate
is
not
worth
the
paper
it
is
written
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
must
be
jesting
,
cruelly
jesting
.
It
ca
n't
be
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
it
is
so
.
Judge
Starkins
has
decided
that
your
manumission
is
*NL*
unlawful
;
your
marriage
a
bad
precedent
,
and
inimical
to
the
welfare
of
*NL*
society
;
and
that
you
and
your
children
are
remanded
to
slavery
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marie
stood
as
one
petrified
.
She
seemed
a
statue
of
fear
and
despair
.
*NL*
She
tried
to
speak
,
reached
out
her
hand
as
if
she
were
groping
in
the
*NL*
dark
,
turned
pale
as
death
as
if
all
the
blood
in
her
veins
had
receded
*NL*
to
her
heart
,
and
,
with
one
heart-rending
cry
of
bitter
agony
,
she
fell
*NL*
senseless
to
the
floor
.
Her
servants
,
to
whom
she
had
been
so
kind
in
*NL*
her
days
of
prosperity
,
bent
pityingly
over
her
,
chafed
her
cold
hands
,
*NL*
and
did
what
they
could
to
restore
her
to
consciousness
.
For
awhile
she
*NL*
was
stricken
with
brain
fever
,
and
her
life
seemed
trembling
on
its
*NL*
frailest
cord
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gracie
was
like
one
perfectly
dazed
.
When
not
watching
by
her
mother
's
*NL*
bedside
she
wandered
aimlessly
about
the
house
,
growing
thinner
day
by
*NL*
day
.
A
slow
fever
was
consuming
her
life
.
Faithfully
and
carefully
Mammy
*NL*
Liza
watched
over
her
,
and
did
all
she
could
to
bring
smiles
to
her
lips
*NL*
and
light
to
her
fading
eyes
,
but
all
in
vain
.
Her
only
interest
in
life
*NL*
was
to
sit
where
she
could
watch
her
mother
as
she
tossed
to
and
fro
in
*NL*
delirium
,
and
to
wonder
what
had
brought
the
change
in
her
once
happy
*NL*
home
.
Finally
she
,
too
,
was
stricken
with
brain
fever
,
which
intervened
*NL*
as
a
mercy
between
her
and
the
great
sorrow
that
was
overshadowing
her
*NL*
young
life
.
Tears
would
fill
the
servants
'
eyes
as
they
saw
the
dear
*NL*
child
drifting
from
them
like
a
lovely
vision
,
too
bright
for
earth
's
*NL*
dull
cares
and
weary
,
wasting
pain
.

CHAPTER
XII
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
SCHOOL-GIRL
NOTIONS
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
Iola
's
stay
in
the
North
she
found
a
strong
tide
of
opposition
*NL*
against
slavery
.
Arguments
against
the
institution
had
entered
the
*NL*
Church
and
made
legislative
halls
the
arenas
of
fierce
debate
.
The
*NL*
subject
had
become
part
of
the
social
converse
of
the
fireside
,
and
had
*NL*
enlisted
the
best
brain
and
heart
of
the
country
.
Anti-slavery
*NL*
discussions
were
pervading
the
strongest
literature
and
claiming
,
a
*NL*
place
on
the
most
popular
platforms
.
*NL*
*NL*
Iola
,
being
a
Southern
girl
and
a
slave-holder
's
daughter
,
always
*NL*
defended
slavery
when
it
was
under
discussion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Slavery
ca
n't
be
wrong
,
''
she
would
say
,
``
for
my
father
is
a
*NL*
slave-holder
,
and
my
mother
is
as
good
to
our
servants
as
she
can
be
.
My
*NL*
father
often
tells
her
that
she
spoils
them
,
and
lets
them
run
over
her
.
*NL*
I
never
saw
my
father
strike
one
of
them
.
I
love
my
mammy
as
much
as
I
*NL*
do
my
own
mother
,
and
I
believe
she
loves
us
just
as
if
we
were
her
own
*NL*
children
.
When
we
are
sick
I
am
sure
that
she
could
not
do
anything
more
*NL*
for
us
than
she
does
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Iola
,
''
responded
one
of
her
school
friends
,
``
after
all
,
they
are
*NL*
not
free
.
Would
you
be
satisfied
to
have
the
most
beautiful
home
,
the
*NL*
costliest
jewels
,
or
the
most
elegant
wardrobe
if
you
were
a
slave
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
the
cases
are
not
parallel
.
Our
slaves
do
not
want
their
freedom
.
*NL*
They
would
not
take
it
if
we
gave
it
to
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
not
the
case
with
them
all
.
My
father
has
seen
men
who
have
*NL*
encountered
almost
incredible
hardships
to
get
their
freedom
.
Iola
,
did
*NL*
you
ever
attend
an
anti-slavery
meeting
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
do
n't
think
these
Abolitionists
have
any
right
to
meddle
in
our
*NL*
affairs
.
I
believe
they
are
prejudiced
against
us
,
and
want
to
get
our
*NL*
property
.
I
read
about
them
in
the
papers
when
I
was
at
home
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
want
to
hear
my
part
of
the
country
run
down
.
My
father
says
the
slaves
*NL*
would
be
very
well
contented
if
no
one
put
wrong
notions
in
their
*NL*
heads
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
was
the
response
of
her
friend
,
``
but
I
do
not
think
that
*NL*
that
slave
mother
who
took
her
four
children
,
crossed
the
Ohio
River
on
*NL*
the
ice
,
killed
one
of
the
children
and
attempted
the
lives
of
the
other
*NL*
two
,
was
a
contented
slave
.
And
that
other
one
,
who
,
running
away
and
*NL*
finding
herself
pursued
,
threw
herself
over
the
Long
Bridge
into
the
*NL*
Potomac
,
was
evidently
not
satisfied
.
I
do
not
think
the
numbers
who
are
*NL*
coming
North
on
the
Underground
Railroad
can
be
very
contented
.
It
is
*NL*
not
natural
for
people
to
run
away
from
happiness
,
and
if
they
are
so
*NL*
happy
and
contented
,
why
did
Congress
pass
the
Fugitive
Slave
Bill
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
do
n't
think
,
''
answered
Iola
,
``
any
of
our
slaves
would
run
away
.
*NL*
I
know
mamma
do
n't
like
slavery
very
much
.
I
have
often
heard
her
say
*NL*
that
she
hoped
the
time
would
come
when
there
would
not
be
a
slave
in
*NL*
the
land
.
My
father
does
not
think
as
she
does
.
He
thinks
slavery
is
not
*NL*
wrong
if
you
treat
them
well
and
do
n't
sell
them
from
their
families
.
I
*NL*
intend
,
after
I
have
graduated
,
to
persuade
pa
to
buy
a
house
in
New
*NL*
Orleans
,
and
spend
the
winter
there
.
You
know
this
will
be
my
first
*NL*
season
out
,
and
I
hope
that
you
will
come
and
spend
the
winter
with
me

*NL*
We
will
have
such
gay
times

and
you
will
so
fall
in
love
with
our
sunny
*NL*
South
that
you
will
never
want
to
come
back
to
shiver
amid
the
snows

*NL*
cold
of
the
North

I
think
one
winter
in
the
South
would
cure
you
of
*NL*
your
Abolitionism

*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you

her
yet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
question
was
asked
by
Louis
Bastine
,
an
attorney
who
had
come
North
*NL*
in
the
interests
of
Lorraine
.
The
scene
was
the
New
England
village
*NL*
where
Mr.
Galen
's
academy
was
located
,
and
which
Iola
was
attending
.
*NL*
This
question
was
addressed
to
Camille
Lecroix
,
Bastine
's
intimate
*NL*
friend
,
who
had
lately
come
North
.
He
was
the
son
of
a
planter
who
lived
*NL*
near
Leroy
's
plantation
,
and
was
familiar
with
Iola
's
family
history
.
*NL*
Since
his
arrival
North
,
Bastine
had
met
him
and
communicated
to
him
his
*NL*
intentions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
just
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
this
morning
as
she
was
going
down
*NL*
the
street
,
''
was
Camille
's
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
a
most
beautiful
creature
,
''
said
Louis
Bastine
.
``
She
has
the
*NL*
proud
poise
of
Leroy
,
the
most
splendid
eyes
I
ever
saw
in
a
woman
's
*NL*
head
,
lovely
complexion
,
and
a
glorious
wealth
of
hair
.
She
would
bring
*NL*
$
2000
any
day
in
a
New
Orleans
market
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
always
feel
sorry
,
''
said
Camille
,
``
when
I
see
one
of
those
Creole
*NL*
girls
brought
to
the
auction
block
.
I
have
known
fathers
who
were
deeply
*NL*
devoted
to
their
daughters
,
but
who
through
some
reverse
of
fortune
were
*NL*
forced
to
part
with
them
,
and
I
always
think
the
blow
has
been
equally
*NL*
terrible
on
both
sides
.
I
had
a
friend
who
had
two
beautiful
daughters
*NL*
whom
he
had
educated
in
the
North
.
They
were
cultured
,
and
really
belles
*NL*
in
society
.
They
were
entirely
ignorant
of
their
lineage
,
but
when
their
*NL*
father
died
it
was
discovered
that
their
mother
had
been
a
slave
.
It
was
*NL*
a
fearful
blow
.
They
would
have
faced
poverty
,
but
the
knowledge
of
*NL*
their
tainted
blood
was
more
than
they
could
bear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
became
of
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
both
died
,
poor
girls
.
I
believe
they
were
as
much
killed
by
the
*NL*
blow
as
if
they
had
been
shot
.
To
tell
you
the
truth
,
Bastine
,
I
feel
*NL*
sorry
for
this
girl
.
I
do
n't
believe
she
has
the
least
idea
of
her
negro
*NL*
blood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Leroy
has
been
careful
to
conceal
it
from
her
,
''
replied
Bastine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
so
?
''
queried
Camille
.
``
Then
he
has
made
a
great
mistake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
help
that
,
''
said
Bastine
;
``
business
is
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
you
get
her
away
?
''
asked
Camille
.
``
You
will
have
to
be
very
*NL*
cautious
,
because
if
these
pesky
Abolitionists
get
an
inkling
of
what
*NL*
you
're
doing
they
will
balk
your
game
double
quick
.
And
when
you
come
to
*NL*
look
at
it
,
is
n't
it
a
shame
to
attempt
to
reduce
that
girl
to
slavery
?
*NL*
She
is
just
as
white
as
we
are
,
as
good
as
any
girl
in
the
land
,
and
*NL*
better
educated
than
thousands
of
white
girls
.
A
girl
with
her
apparent
*NL*
refinement
and
magnificent
beauty
,
were
it
not
for
the
cross
in
her
*NL*
blood
,
I
would
be
proud
to
introduce
to
our
set
.
She
would
be
the
*NL*
sensation
of
the
season
.
I
believe
to-day
it
would
be
easier
for
me
to
*NL*
go
to
the
slums
and
take
a
young
girl
from
there
,
and
have
her
*NL*
introduced
as
my
wife
,
than
to
have
society
condone
the
offense
if
I
*NL*
married
that
lovely
girl
.
There
is
not
a
social
circle
in
the
South
that
*NL*
would
not
take
it
as
a
gross
insult
to
have
her
introduced
into
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Bastine
,
``
my
plan
is
settled
.
Leroy
has
never
allowed
her
*NL*
to
spend
her
vacations
at
home
.
I
understand
she
is
now
very
anxious
to
*NL*
get
home
,
and
,
as
Lorraine
's
attorney
,
I
have
come
on
his
account
to
*NL*
take
her
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
will
you
do
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
tell
her
her
father
is
dangerously
ill
,
and
desires
her
to
come
*NL*
as
quickly
as
possible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
her
inventoried
with
the
rest
of
the
property
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
she
know
that
her
father
is
dead
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
not
,
''
said
Bastine
.
``
She
is
not
in
mourning
,
but
appeared
very
*NL*
light-hearted
this
morning
,
laughing
and
talking
with
two
other
girls
.
I
*NL*
was
struck
with
her
great
beauty
,
and
asked
a
gentleman
who
she
was
.
He
*NL*
said
,
`
Miss
Leroy
,
of
Mississippi
.
'
I
think
Lorraine
has
managed
the
*NL*
affair
so
as
to
keep
her
in
perfect
ignorance
of
her
father
's
death
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
like
the
job
,
but
I
never
let
sentiment
interfere
with
my
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Iola
!
When
she
said
slavery
was
not
a
bad
thing
,
little
did
she
*NL*
think
that
she
was
destined
to
drink
to
its
bitter
dregs
the
cup
she
was
*NL*
so
ready
to
press
to
the
lips
of
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
think
she
will
take
to
her
situation
?
''
asked
Camille
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
I
guess
,
''
said
Bastine
,
``
she
will
sulk
and
take
it
pretty
hard
at
*NL*
first
;
but
if
she
is
managed
right
she
will
soon
get
over
it
.
Give
her
*NL*
plenty
of
jewelry
,
fine
clothes
,
and
an
easy
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
this
business
must
be
conducted
with
the
utmost
secrecy
and
speed
.
*NL*
Her
mother
could
not
have
written
to
her
,
for
she
has
been
suffering
*NL*
with
brain
fever
and
nervous
prostration
since
Leroy
's
death
.
Lorraine
*NL*
knows
her
market
value
too
well
,
and
is
too
shrewd
to
let
so
much
*NL*
property
pass
out
of
his
hands
without
making
an
effort
to
retain
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
she
any
brothers
or
sisters
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
a
brother
,
''
replied
Bastine
;
``
but
he
is
at
another
school
,
and
I
*NL*
have
no
orders
from
Lorraine
in
reference
to
him
.
If
I
can
get
the
girl
*NL*
I
am
willing
to
let
well
enough
alone
.
I
dread
the
interview
with
the
*NL*
principal
more
than
anything
else
.
I
am
afraid
he
will
hem
and
haw
,
and
*NL*
have
his
doubts
.
Perhaps
,
when
he
sees
my
letters
and
hears
my
story
,
I
*NL*
can
pull
the
wool
over
his
eyes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Louis
,
this
is
a
pitiful
piece
of
business
.
I
should
hate
to
be
*NL*
engaged
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
deep
flush
of
shame
overspread
for
a
moment
the
face
of
Lorraine
's
*NL*
attorney
,
as
he
replied
:
``
I
do
n't
like
the
job
,
but
I
have
undertaken
*NL*
it
,
and
must
go
through
with
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
no
'
_
must

about
it
.
Were
I
in
your
place
I
would
wash
my
hands
*NL*
of
the
whole
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
afford
it
,
''
was
Bastine
's
hard
,
business-like
reply
.
On
the
*NL*
next
morning
after
this
conversation
between
these
two
young
men
,
Louis
*NL*
Bastine
presented
himself
to
the
principal
of
the
academy
,
with
the
*NL*
request
that
Iola
be
permitted
to
leave
immediately
to
attend
the
*NL*
sick-bed
of
her
father
,
who
was
dangerously
ill
.
The
principal
*NL*
hesitated
,
but
while
he
was
deliberating
,
a
telegram
,
purporting
to
come
*NL*
from
Iola
's
mother
,
summoned
Iola
to
her
father
's
bedside
without
delay
.
*NL*
The
principal
,
set
at
rest
in
regard
to
the
truthfulness
of
the
*NL*
dispatch
,
not
only
permitted
but
expedited
her
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Iola
and
Bastine
took
the
earliest
train
,
and
traveled
without
pausing
*NL*
until
they
reached
a
large
hotel
in
a
Southern
city
.
There
they
were
*NL*
obliged
to
wait
a
few
hours
until
they
could
resume
their
journey
,
the
*NL*
train
having
failed
to
make
connection
.
Iola
sat
in
a
large
,
lonely
*NL*
parlor
,
waiting
for
the
servant
to
show
her
to
a
private
room
.
She
had
*NL*
never
known
a
great
sorrow
.
Never
before
had
the
shadows
of
death
*NL*
mingled
with
the
sunshine
of
her
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anxious
,
travel-worn
,
and
heavy-hearted
,
she
sat
in
an
easy
chair
,
with
*NL*
nothing
to
divert
her
from
the
grief
and
anxiety
which
rendered
every
*NL*
delay
a
source
of
painful
anxiety
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
hope
that
he
will
be
alive
and
growing
better
!
''
was
the
thought
*NL*
which
kept
constantly
revolving
in
her
mind
,
until
she
fell
asleep
.
In
*NL*
her
dreams
she
was
at
home
,
encircled
in
the
warm
clasp
of
her
father
's
*NL*
arms
,
feeling
her
mother
's
kisses
lingering
on
her
lips
,
and
hearing
the
*NL*
joyous
greetings
of
the
servants
and
Mammy
Liza
's
glad
welcome
as
she
*NL*
folded
her
to
her
heart
.
From
this
dream
of
bliss
she
was
awakened
by
a
*NL*
burning
kiss
pressed
on
her
lips
,
and
a
strong
arm
encircling
her
.
*NL*
Gazing
around
and
taking
in
the
whole
situation
,
she
sprang
from
her
*NL*
seat
,
her
eyes
flashing
with
rage
and
scorn
,
her
face
flushed
to
the
*NL*
roots
of
her
hair
,
her
voice
shaken
with
excitement
,
and
every
nerve
*NL*
trembling
with
angry
emotion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
dare
you
do
such
a
thing
!
Do
n't
you
know
if
my
father
were
here
he
*NL*
would
crush
you
to
the
earth
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
so
fast
,
my
lovely
tigress
,
''
said
Bastine
,
``
your
father
knew
what
*NL*
he
was
doing
when
he
placed
you
in
my
charge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
father
made
a
great
mistake
,
if
he
thought
he
had
put
me
in
charge
*NL*
of
a
gentleman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
your
guardian
for
the
present
,
''
replied
Bastine
.
``
I
am
to
see
you
*NL*
safe
home
,
and
then
my
commission
ends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
it
were
ended
now
,
''
she
exclaimed
,
trembling
with
anger
and
*NL*
mortification
.
Her
voice
was
choked
by
emotion
,
and
broken
by
smothered
*NL*
sobs
.
Louis
Bastine
thought
to
himself
,
``
she
is
a
real
spitfire
,
but
*NL*
beautiful
even
in
her
wrath
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
rest
of
her
journey
Iola
preserved
a
most
freezing
reserve
*NL*
towards
Bastine
.
At
length
the
journey
was
ended
.
Pale
and
anxious
she
*NL*
rode
up
the
avenue
which
led
to
her
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
strange
silence
pervaded
the
place
.
The
servants
moved
sadly
from
*NL*
place
to
place
,
and
spoke
in
subdued
tones
.
The
windows
were
heavily
*NL*
draped
with
crape
,
and
a
funeral
air
pervaded
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mammy
Liza
met
her
at
the
door
,
and
,
with
streaming
eyes
and
convulsive
*NL*
sobs
,
folded
her
to
her
heart
,
as
Iola
exclaimed
,
in
tones
of
hopeless
*NL*
anguish
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
papa
's
dead
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

said
mammy
,
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mam
Liza
stepped
lightly
into
Mrs.
Leroy
's
room
,
and
gently
apprised
her
*NL*
of
Iola
's
arrival
.
In
a
darkened
room
lay
the
stricken
mother
,
almost
*NL*
distracted
by
her
late
bereavement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Iola
,
''
she
exclaimed
,
as
her
daughter
entered
,
``
is
this
you
?
I
am
*NL*
so
sorry
you
came
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
burying
her
head
in
Iola
's
bosom
,
she
wept
convulsively
.
``
Much
as
*NL*
I
love
you
,
''
she
continued
,
between
her
sobs
,
``
and
much
as
I
longed
to
*NL*
see
you
,
I
am
sorry
you
came

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

mother

''
replied
Iola
,
astonished
,
``
I
received
your
telegram
last
*NL*
Wednesday
,
and
I
took
the
earliest
train
I
could
get

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
child
,
I
never
sent
you
a

It
was
a
trick
to
bring
you
*NL*
down
South
and
reduce
you
to
slavery
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Iola
eyed
her
mother
curiously
.
What
did
she
mean
?
Had
grief
dethroned
*NL*
her
reason
?
Yet
her
eye
was
clear
,
her
manner
perfectly
rational
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marie
saw
the
astounded
look
on
Iola
's
face
,
and
nerving
herself
to
the
*NL*
task
,
said
:
``
Iola
,
I
must
tell
you
what
your
father
always
enjoined
me
*NL*
to
be
silent
about
.
I
did
not
think
it
was
the
wisest
thing
,
but
I
*NL*
yielded
to
his
desires
.
I
have
negro
blood
in
my
veins
.
I
was
your
*NL*
father
's
slave
before
I
married
him
.
His
relatives
have
set
aside
his
*NL*
will
.
The
courts
have
declared
our
marriage
null
and
void
and
my
*NL*
manumission
illegal
,
and
we
are
all
to
be
remanded
to
slavery
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
An
expression
of
horror
and
anguish
swept
over
Iola
's
face
,
and
,
turning
*NL*
deathly
pale
,
she
exclaimed
,
``
Oh
,
mother
,
it
ca
n't
be
so

you
must
be
*NL*
dreaming

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

my
child
;
it
is
a
terrible
reality

*NL*
*NL*
Almost
wild
with
agony
,
Iola
paced
the
floor
,
as
the
fearful
truth
broke
*NL*
in
crushing
anguish
upon
her
mind
.
Then
bursting
into
a
paroxysm
of
*NL*
tears

by
peals
of
hysterical
laughter

Then
growing
calmer

she
said

this

*NL*

None

so
aloof

*NL*

The

said

placing

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma

called
a
faint
voice
from
the
adjoining
room

Marie

immediately
arose
and
went
to
the
bedside
of
her
sick
child
,
where
Mammy
*NL*
Liza
was
holding
her
faithful
vigils
.
The
child
had
just
awakened
from
a
*NL*
fitful
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
,
''
she
said
,
``
that
I
heard
Iola

voice

Has
she

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

do

she
said
,
as
a
bright
smile
broke
over
her
dying
features
.
*NL*
*NL*
Iola
passed
quickly
into
the
room
.
Gracie
reached
out
her
thin
,
*NL*
bloodless
hand
,
clasped
Iola
's
palm
in
hers
,
and
said
:
``
I
am
so
glad
you
*NL*
have
come

Dear
Iola
,
stand
by

You

all
she

It

not

You

meet

*NL*
*NL*
Swiftly
the
tidings
went
through
the
house
that
Gracie
was
dying
.
The
*NL*
servants
gathered
around
her
with
tearful
eyes
,
as
she
bade
them
all
*NL*
good-bye
.
When
she
had
finished
,
and
Mammy
had
lowered
the
pillow
,
an
*NL*
unwonted
radiance
lit
up
her
eye
,
and
an
expression
of
ineffable
*NL*
gladness
overspread
her
face
,
as
she
murmured
:
``
It
is
beautiful

so
*NL*
beautiful
!

Fainter
and
fainter
grew
her
voice
,
until
,
without
a

struggle

she
passed
away
beyond

CHAPTER
XIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
REJECTED
SUITOR
.
*NL*
*NL*
Very
unexpected
was
Dr.
Gresham
's
proposal
to
Iola
.
She
had
heartily
*NL*
enjoyed
his
society
and
highly
valued
his
friendship
,
but
he
had
never
*NL*
been
associated
in
her
mind
with
either
love
or
marriage
.
As
he
held
her
*NL*
hand
in
his
a
tell-tale
flush
rose
to
her
cheek
,
a
look
of
grateful
*NL*
surprise
beamed
from
her
eye
,
but
it
was
almost
immediately
succeeded
by
*NL*
an
air
of
inexpressible
sadness
,
a
drooping
of
her
eyelids
,
and
an
*NL*
increasing
pallor
of
her
cheek
.
She
withdrew
her
hand
from
his
,
shook
*NL*
her
head
sadly
,
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Doctor
;
that
can
never
be
.
I
am
very
grateful
to
you
for
your
*NL*
kindness
.
I
value
your
friendship
,
but
neither
gratitude
nor
friendship
*NL*
is
love
,
and
I
have
nothing
more
than
those
to
give
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
present
,
''
said
Dr.
Gresham
;
``
but
may
I
not
hope
your
friendship
*NL*
will
ripen
into
love
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doctor
,
I
could
not
promise
.
I
do
not
think
that
I
should
.
There
are
*NL*
barriers
between
us
that
I
can
not
pass
.
Were
you
to
know
them
I
think
*NL*
you
would
say
the
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Just
then
the
ambulance
brought
in
a
wounded
scout
,
and
Iola
found
*NL*
relief
from
the
wounds
of
her
own
heart
in
attending
to
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Gresham
knew
the
barrier
that
lay
between
them
.
It
was
one
which
his
*NL*
love
had
surmounted
.
But
he
was
too
noble
and
generous
to
take
advantage
*NL*
of
her
loneliness
to
press
his
suit
.
He
had
lived
in
a
part
of
the
*NL*
country
where
he
had
scarcely
ever
seen
a
colored
person
,
and
around
the
*NL*
race
their
misfortunes
had
thrown
a
halo
of
romance
.
To
him
the
negro
*NL*
was
a
picturesque
being
,
over
whose
woes
he
had
wept
when
a
child
,
and
*NL*
whose
wrongs
he
was
ready
to
redress
when
a
man
.
But
when
he
saw
the
*NL*
lovely
girl
who
had
been
rescued
by
the
commander
of
the
post
from
the
*NL*
clutches
of
slavery
,
all
the
manhood
and
chivalry
in
his
nature
arose
in
*NL*
her
behalf
,
and
he
was
ready
to
lay
on
the
altar
of
her
heart
his
first
*NL*
grand
and
overmastering
love
.
Not
discouraged
by
her
refusal
,
but
*NL*
determined
to
overcome
her
objections
,
Dr.
Gresham
resolved
that
he
*NL*
would
abide
his
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Iola
was
not
indifferent
to
Dr.
Gresham
.
She
admired
his
manliness
and
*NL*
respected
his
character
.
He
was
tall
and
handsome
,
a
fine
specimen
of
*NL*
the
best
brain
and
heart
of
New
England
.
He
had
been
nurtured
under
*NL*
grand
and
ennobling
influences
.
His
father
was
a
devoted
Abolitionist
.
*NL*
His
mother
was
kind-hearted
,
but
somewhat
exclusive
and
aristocratic
.
*NL*
She
would
have
looked
upon
his
marriage
with
Iola
as
a
mistake
and
*NL*
feared
that
such
an
alliance
would
hurt
the
prospects
of
her
daughters
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
Iola
's
stay
in
the
North
,
she
had
learned
enough
of
the
racial
*NL*
feeling
to
influence
her
decision
in
reference
to
Dr.
Gresham
's
offer
.
*NL*
Iola
,
like
other
girls
,
had
had
her
beautiful
day-dreams
before
she
was
*NL*
rudely
awakened
by
the
fate
which
had
dragged
her
into
the
depths
of
*NL*
slavery
.
In
the
chambers
of
her
imagery
were
pictures
of
noble
deeds
;
of
*NL*
high
,
heroic
men
,
knightly
,
tender
,
true
,
and
brave
.
In
Dr.
Gresham
she
*NL*
saw
the
ideal
of
her
soul
exemplified
.
But
in
her
lonely
condition
,
*NL*
with
all
its
background
of
terrible
sorrow
and
deep
abasement
,
she
had
*NL*
never
for
a
moment
thought
of
giving
or
receiving
love
from
one
of
that
*NL*
race
who
had
been
so
lately
associated
in
her
mind
with
horror
,
*NL*
aversion
,
and
disgust
.
His
kindness
to
her
had
been
a
new
experience
.
*NL*
His
companionship
was
an
unexpected
pleasure
.
She
had
learned
to
enjoy
*NL*
his
presence
and
to
miss
him
when
absent
,
and
when
she
began
to
question
*NL*
her
heart
she
found
that
unconsciously
it
was
entwining
around
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
said
to
herself
,
``
I
do
like
him
;
but
I
can
never
marry
him
.
*NL*
To
the
man
I
marry
my
heart
must
be
as
open
as
the
flowers
to
the
sun
.
I
*NL*
could
not
accept
his
hand
and
hide
from
him
the
secret
of
my
birth
;
and
*NL*
I
could
not
consent
to
choose
the
happiest
lot
on
earth
without
first
*NL*
finding
my
poor
heart-stricken
and
desolate
mother
.
Perhaps
some
day
I
*NL*
may
have
the
courage
to
tell
him
my
sad
story
,
and
then
make
my
heart
*NL*
the
sepulchre
in
which
to
bury
all
the
love
which
might
have
gladdened
*NL*
and
brightened
my
whole
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
sad
and
weary
months
which
ensued
while
the
war
dragged
its
*NL*
slow
length
along
,
Dr.
Gresham
and
Iola
often
met
by
the
bedsides
of
the
*NL*
wounded
and
dying
,
and
sometimes
he
would
drop
a
few
words
at
which
her
*NL*
heart
would
beat
quicker
and
her
cheek
flush
more
vividly
.
But
he
was
so
*NL*
kind
,
tender
,
and
respectful
,
that
Iola
had
no
idea
he
knew
her
race
*NL*
affiliations
.
She
knew
from
unmistakable
signs
that
Dr.
Gresham
had
*NL*
learned
to
love
her
,
and
that
he
had
power
to
call
forth
the
warmest
*NL*
affection
of
her
soul
;
but
she
fought
with
her
own
heart
and
repressed
*NL*
its
rising
love
.
She
felt
that
it
was
best
for
his
sake
that
they
should
*NL*
not
marry
.
When
she
saw
the
evidences
of
his
increasing
love
she
*NL*
regretted
that
she
had
not
informed
him
at
the
first
of
the
barrier
that
*NL*
lay
between
them
;
it
might
have
saved
him
unnecessary
suffering
.
*NL*
Thinking
thus
,
Iola
resolved
,
at
whatever
cost
of
pain
it
might
be
to
*NL*
herself
,
to
explain
to
Dr.
Gresham
what
she
meant
by
the
insurmountable
*NL*
barrier
.
Iola
,
after
a
continuous
strain
upon
her
nervous
system
for
*NL*
months
,
began
to
suffer
from
general
debility
and
nervous
depression
.
*NL*
Dr.
Gresham
saw
the
increasing
pallor
on
Iola
's
cheek
and
the
loss
of
*NL*
buoyancy
in
her
step
.
One
morning
,
as
she
turned
from
the
bed
of
a
young
*NL*
soldier
for
whom
she
had
just
written
a
letter
to
his
mother
,
there
was
*NL*
such
a
look
of
pity
and
sorrow
on
her
face
that
Dr.
Gresham
's
whole
*NL*
heart
went
out
in
sympathy
for
her
,
and
he
resolved
to
break
the
silence
*NL*
he
had
imposed
upon
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Iola
,
''
he
said
,
and
there
was
a
depth
of
passionate
tenderness
in
his
*NL*
voice
,
a
volume
of
unexpressed
affection
in
his
face
,
``
you
are
wronging
*NL*
yourself
.
You
are
sinking
beneath
burdens
too
heavy
for
you
to
bear
.
It
*NL*
seems
to
me
that
besides
the
constant
drain
upon
your
sympathies
there
*NL*
is
some
great
sorrow
preying
upon
your
life
;
some
burden
that
ought
to
*NL*
be
shared
.
''
He
gazed
upon
her
so
ardently
that
each
cord
of
her
heart
*NL*
seemed
to
vibrate
,
and
unbidden
tears
sprang
to
her
lustrous
eyes
,
as
*NL*
she
said
,
sadly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doctor
,
you
are
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Iola
,
my
heart
is
longing
to
lift
those
burdens
from
your
life
.
Love
,
*NL*
like
faith
,
laughs
at
impossibilities
.
I
can
conceive
of
no
barrier
too
*NL*
high
for
my
love
to
surmount
.
Consent
to
be
mine
,
as
nothing
else
on
*NL*
earth
is
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doctor
,
you
know
not
what
you
ask
,
''
replied
Iola
.
``
Instead
of
coming
*NL*
into
this
hospital
a
self-sacrificing
woman
,
laying
her
every
gift
and
*NL*
advantage
upon
the
altar
of
her
country
,
I
came
as
a
rescued
slave
,
glad
*NL*
to
find
a
refuge
from
a
fate
more
cruel
than
death
;
a
fate
from
which
I

was
rescued
by
the
intervention

dead
friend

,
where
the
*NL*
white
population
was
very
sparse
.
We
had
no
neighbors
who
ever
visited
*NL*
us
;
no
young
white
girls
with
whom
I
ever
played
in
my
childhood
;
but
,
*NL*
never
having
enjoyed
such
companionship
,
I
was
unconscious
of
any
sense
*NL*
of
privation
.
Our
parents
spared
no
pains
to
make
the
lives
of
their
*NL*
children
-LRB-
we
were
three
-RRB-
as
bright
and
pleasant
as
they
could
.
Our
home
*NL*
was
so
happy
.
We
had
a
large
number
of
servants
,
who
were
devoted
to
us
.
*NL*
I
never
had
the
faintest
suspicion
that
there
was
any
wrongfulness
in
*NL*
slavery
,
and
I
never
dreamed
of
the
dreadful
fate
which
broke
in
a
storm
*NL*
of
fearful
anguish
over
our
devoted
heads
.
Papa
used
to
take
us
to
New
*NL*
Orleans
to
see
the
Mardi
Gras
,
and
while
there
we
visited
the
theatres
*NL*
and
other
places
of
amusement
and
interest
.
At
home
we
had
books
,
*NL*
papers
,
and
magazines
to
beguile
our
time
.
Perfectly
ignorant
of
my
*NL*
racial
connection
,
I
was
sent
to
a
Northern
academy
,
and
soon
made
many
*NL*
friends
among
my
fellow-students
.
Companionship
with
girls
of
my
own
age
*NL*
was
a
new
experience
,
which
I
thoroughly
enjoyed
.
I
spent
several
years
*NL*
in
New
England
,
and
was
busily
preparing
for
my
commencement
exercises
*NL*
when
my
father
was
snatched
away
--
died
of
yellow
fever
on
his
way
North
*NL*
to
witness
my
graduation
.
Through
a
stratagem
,
I
was
brought
hurriedly
*NL*
from
the
North
,
and
found
that
my
father
was
dead
;
that
his
nearest
*NL*
kinsman
had
taken
possession
of
our
property
;
that
my
mother
's
marriage
*NL*
had
been
declared
illegal
,
because
of
an
imperceptible
infusion
of
negro
*NL*
blood
in
her
veins
;
and
that
she
and
her
children
had
been
remanded
to
*NL*
slavery
.
I
was
torn
from
my
mother
,
sold
as
a
slave
,
and
subjected
to
*NL*
cruel
indignities
,
from
which
I
was
rescued
and
a
place
given
to
me
in
*NL*
this
hospital
.
Doctor
,
I
did
not
choose
my
lot
in
life
,
but
I
have
no
*NL*
other
alternative
than
to
accept
it
.
The
intense
horror
and
agony
I
felt
*NL*
when
I
was
first
told
the
story
are
over
.
Thoughts
and
purposes
have
*NL*
come
to
me
in
the
shadow
I
should
never
have
learned
in
the
sunshine
.
I
*NL*
am
constantly
rousing
myself
up
to
suffer
and
be
strong
.
I
intend
,
when
*NL*
this
conflict
is
over
,
to
cast
my
lot
with
the
freed
people
as
a
helper
,
*NL*
teacher
,
and
friend
.
I
have
passed
through
a
fiery
ordeal
,
but
this
*NL*
ministry
of
suffering
will
not
be
in
vain
.
I
feel
that
my
mind
has
*NL*
matured
beyond
my
years
.
I
am
a
wonder
to
myself
.
It
seems
as
if
years
*NL*
had
been
compressed
into
a
few
short
months
.
In
telling
you
this
,
do
you
*NL*
not
,
can
you
not
,
see
that
there
is
an
insurmountable
barrier
between
*NL*
us
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
not
,
''
replied
Dr.
Gresham
.
``
I
love
you
for
your
own
sake
.
And
*NL*
with
this
the
disadvantages
of
birth
have
nothing
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
say
so
now
,
and
I
believe
that
you
are
perfectly
sincere
.
Today
*NL*
your
friendship
springs
from
compassion
,
but
,
when
that
subsides
,
might
*NL*
you
not
look
on
me
as
an
inferior
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Iola
,
you
do
not
understand
me
.
You
think
too
meanly
of
me
.
You
must
*NL*
not
judge
me
by
the
worst
of
my
race
.
Surely
our
country
has
produced
a
*NL*
higher
type
of
manhood
than
the
men
by
whom
you
were
tried
and
tempted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tried
,
but
not
tempted
,
''
said
Iola
,
as
a
deep
flush
overspread
her
*NL*
face
;
``
I
was
never
tempted
.
I
was
sold
from
State
to
State
as
an
article
*NL*
of
merchandise
.
I
had
outrages
heaped
on
me
which
might
well
crimson
the
*NL*
cheek
of
honest
womanhood
with
shame
,
but
I
never
fell
into
the
clutches
*NL*
of
an
owner
for
whom
I
did
not
feel
the
utmost
loathing
and
intensest
*NL*
horror
.
I
have
heard
men
talk
glibly
of
the
degradation
of
the
negro
,
*NL*
but
there
is
a
vast
difference
between
abasement
of
condition
and
*NL*
degradation
of
character
.
I
was
abased
,
but
the
men
who
trampled
on
me
*NL*
were
the
degraded
ones
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Iola
,
you
must
not
blame
all
for
what
a
few
have
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
few
have
done
?
Did
not
the
whole
nation
consent
to
our
abasement
?
''
*NL*
asked
Iola
,
bitterly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Miss
Iola
,
we
did
not
all
consent
to
it
.
Slavery
drew
a
line
of
*NL*
cleavage
in
this
country
.
Although
we
were
under
one
government
we
were
*NL*
farther
apart
in
our
sentiments
than
if
we
had
been
divided
by
lofty
*NL*
mountains
and
separated
by
wide
seas
.
And
had
not
Northern
sentiment
*NL*
been
brought
to
bear
against
the
institution
,
slavery
would
have
been
*NL*
intact
until
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Doctor
,
the
negro
is
under
a
social
ban
both
North
and
South
.
Our
*NL*
enemies
have
the
ear
of
the
world
,
and
they
can
depict
us
just
as
they
*NL*
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true
;
but
the
negro
has
no
other
alternative
than
to
make
*NL*
friends
of
his
calamities
.
Other
men
have
plead
his
cause
,
but
out
of
*NL*
the
race
must
come
its
own
defenders
.
With
them
the
pen
must
be
*NL*
mightier
than
the
sword
.
It
is
the
weapon
of
civilization
,
and
they
must
*NL*
use
it
in
their
own
defense
.
We
can
not
tell
what
is
in
them
until
they
*NL*
express
themselves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
I
think
there
is
a
large
amount
of
latent
and
undeveloped
*NL*
ability
in
the
race
,
which
they
will
learn
to
use
for
their
own
benefit
.
*NL*
This
my
hospital
experience
has
taught
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
said
Dr.
Gresham
,
``
they
must
learn
to
struggle
,
labor
,
and
*NL*
achieve
.
By
facts
,
not
theories
,
they
will
be
judged
in
the
future
.
The
*NL*
Anglo-Saxon
race
is
proud
,
domineering
,
aggressive
,
and
impatient
of
a
*NL*
rival
,
and
,
as
I
think
,
has
more
capacity
for
dragging
down
a
weaker
*NL*
race
than
uplifting
it
.
They
have
been
a
conquering
and
achieving
*NL*
people
,
marvelous
in
their
triumphs
of
mind
over
matter
.
They
have
*NL*
manifested
the
traits
of
character
which
are
developed
by
success
and
*NL*
victory
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
,
''
said
Iola
,
earnestly
,
``
I
believe
the
time
will
come
when
the
*NL*
civilization
of
the
negro
will
assume
a
better
phase
than
you
*NL*
Anglo-Saxons
possess
.
You
will
prove
unworthy
of
your
high
vantage
*NL*
ground
if
you
only
use
your
superior
ability
to
victimize
feebler
races
*NL*
and
minister
to
a
selfish
greed
of
gold
and
a
love
of
domination
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Iola
,
''
said
Dr.
Gresham
,
a
little
impatiently
,
``
what
has
all
this
*NL*
to
do
with
our
marriage
?
Your
complexion
is
as
fair
as
mine

What
is
to
*NL*
hinder
you
from
sharing
my
Northern
home
,
from
having
my
mother
to
be
*NL*
your
mother
?
''
The
tones
of
his
voice
grew
tender
,
as
he
raised
his
eyes
*NL*
to
Iola
's
face
and
anxiously
awaited
her
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dr.
Gresham
,
''
said
Iola
,
sadly
,
``
should
the
story
of
my
life
be

revealed

would
they
be
willing

*NL*
traditions
of
my
blood
,
forget
all
the
terrible
humiliations
through
*NL*

I
have
passed

I
have
too
much
self-respect
to
enter
your

I
have
lived
in
New
England
.
I
love
the
*NL*
sunshine

her
homes
and
the
freedom
of
her
institutions
.
But
New
*NL*
England
is
not
free
from
racial
prejudice
,
and
I
would
never
enter
a
*NL*
family
where
I
would
be
an
unwelcome
member

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Iola
,
dear
,
you
have
nothing
to
fear
in
that
direction

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doctor

''
she
said
,
and
a
faint
flush
rose
to
her
cheek
,
``
suppose
we
*NL*
should
marry
,
and
little
children
in
after
years
should
nestle
in
our
*NL*
arms

and
one
of
them
show
unmistakable
signs
of
color
,
would
you
be
*NL*
satisfied
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
steadfastly
into
his
eyes
,
which
fell
beneath
her
*NL*
truth-seeking
gaze
.
His
face
flushed
as
if
the
question
had
suddenly
*NL*
perplexed
him
.
Iola
saw
the
irresolution
on
his
face
,
and
framed
her
*NL*
answer
accordingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
I
see
,
''
she
said
,
``
that
you
are
puzzled
.
You
had
not
taken
into
*NL*
account
what
might
result
from
such
a
marriage
.
I
will
relieve
you
from
*NL*
all
embarrassment
by
simply
saying
I
can
not
be
your
wife
.
When
the
war
*NL*
is
over
I
intend
to
search
the
country
for
my
mother
.
Doctor
,
were
you
*NL*
to
give
me
a
palace-like
home
,
with
velvet
carpets
to
hush
my
tread
,
and
*NL*
magnificence
to
surround
my
way
,
I
should
miss
her
voice
amid
all
other
*NL*
tones
,
her
presence
amid
every
scene
.
Oh
,
you
do
not
know
how
hungry
my
*NL*
heart
is
for
my

!
Were
I
to
marry
you
I
would
carry
an
aching

heart
into
your
home

dim
its
brightness

I
have
resolved
never

The
hope
of
finding

has
colored
*NL*
all
my
life
since
I
regained
my
freedom

It
has
helped
sustain
me
in
the
*NL*
hour
of
fearful
trial
.
When
I
see
her
I
want
to
have
the
proud
*NL*
consciousness
that
I
bring
her
back
a
heart
just
as
loving

faithful

*NL*
and
devoted
as
the
last
hour
we
parted

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
is
this
your
final
answer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is

I
have
pledged
my
life
to
that
resolve
,
and
I
believe
time
and
*NL*
patience
will
reward
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
deep
shadow
of
sorrow
and
disappointment
on
the
face
of
Dr.
*NL*
Gresham
as
he
rose
to
leave
.
For
a
moment
he
held
her
hand
as
it
lay
*NL*
limp
in
his
own
.
If
she
wavered
in
her
determination
it
was
only
for
a
*NL*
moment
.
No
quivering
of
her
lip
or
paling
of
her
cheek
betrayed
any
*NL*
struggle
of
her
heart
.
Her
resolve
was
made
,
and
his
words
were
*NL*
powerless
to
swerve
her
from
the
purpose
of
her
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
Dr.
Gresham
had
gone
Iola
went
to
her
room
and
sat
buried
in
*NL*
thought
.
It
seemed
as
if
the
fate
of
Tantalus
was
hers
,
without
his
*NL*
crimes
.
Here
she
was
lonely
and
heart-stricken
,
and
unto
her
was
*NL*
presented
the
offer
of
love
,
home
,
happiness
,
and
social
position
;
the
*NL*
heart
and
hand
of
a
man
too
noble
and
generous
to
refuse
her
*NL*
companionship
for
life
on
account
of
the
blood
in
her
veins
.
Why
should
*NL*
she
refuse
these
desirable
boons
?
But
,
mingling
with
these
beautiful
*NL*
visions
of
manly
love
and
protecting
care
she
saw
the
anguish
of
her
*NL*
heart-stricken
mother
and
the
pale
,
sweet
face
of
her
dying
sister
,
as
*NL*
with
her
latest
breath
she
had
said
,
``
Iola
,
stand
by
mamma
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
''
she
said
to
herself
;
``
I
was
right
to
refuse
Dr.
Gresham
.
How
*NL*
dare
I
dream
of
happiness
when
my
poor
mamma
's
heart
may
be
slowly
*NL*
breaking
?
I
should
be
ashamed
to
live
and
ashamed
to
die
were
I
to
*NL*
choose
a
happy
lot
for
myself
and
leave
poor
mamma
to
struggle
alone
.
I
*NL*
will
never
be
satisfied
till
I
get

of
her
.
And
when
I
have
found
*NL*
her
I

do
all

cheer
and

CHAPTER
XIV
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
HARRY
LEROY
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
several
weeks
after
Iola
had
written
to
her
brother
that
her
*NL*
letter
reached
him
.
The
trusty
servant
to
whom
she
delivered
it
watched
*NL*
his
opportunity
to
mail
it
.
At
last
he
succeeded
in
slipping
it
into
*NL*
Lorraine
's
mail
and
dropping
them
all
into
the
post
office
together
.
*NL*
Harry
was
studying
at
a
boys
'
academy
in
Maine
.
His
father
had
given
*NL*
that
State
the
preference
because
,
while
on
a
visit
there
,
he
had
been
*NL*
favorably
impressed
with
the
kindness
and
hospitality
of
the
people
.
He
*NL*
had
sent
his
son
a
large
sum
of
money
,
and
given
him
permission
to
spend
*NL*
awhile
with
some
school-chums
till
he
was
ready
to
bring
the
family
*NL*
North
,
where
they
could
all
spend
the
summer
together
.
Harry
had
*NL*
returned
from
his
visit
,
and
was
looking
for
letters
and
remittances
*NL*
from
home
,
when
a
letter
,
all
crumpled
,
was
handed
him
by
the
principal
*NL*
of
the
academy
.
He
recognized
his
sister
's
handwriting
and
eagerly
*NL*
opened
the
letter
.
As
he
read
,
he
turned
very
pale
;
then
a
deep
flush
*NL*
overspread
his
face
and
an
angry
light
flashed
from
his
eyes
.
As
he
read
*NL*
on
,
his
face
became
still
paler
;
he
gasped
for
breath
and
fell
into
a
*NL*
swoon
.
Appalled
at
the
sudden
change
which
had
swept
over
him
like
a
*NL*
deadly
sirocco
,
the
principal
rushed
to
the
fallen
boy
,
picked
up
the
*NL*
missive
that
lay
beside
him
,
and
immediately
rang
for
help
and
*NL*
dispatched
for
the
doctor
.
The
doctor
came
at
once
and
was
greatly
*NL*
puzzled
.
Less
than
an
hour
before
,
he
had
seen
him
with
a
crowd
of
*NL*
merry
,
laughter-loving
boys
,
apparently
as
light-hearted
and
joyous
as
*NL*
any
of
them
;
now
he
lay
with
features
drawn
and
pinched
,
his
face
deadly
*NL*
pale
,
as
if
some
terrible
suffering
had
sent
all
the
blood
in
his
veins
*NL*
to
stagnate
around
his
heart
.
Harry
opened
his
eyes
,
shuddered
,
and
*NL*
relapsed
into
silence
.
The
doctor
,
all
at
sea
in
regard
to
the
cause
of
*NL*
the
sudden
attack
,
did
all
that
he
could
to
restore
him
to
consciousness
*NL*
and
quiet
the
perturbation
of
his
spirit
.
He
succeeded
,
but
found
he
was
*NL*
strangely
silent
.
A
terrible
shock
had
sent
a
tremor
through
every
*NL*
nerve
,
and
the
doctor
watched
with
painful
apprehension
its
effect
upon
*NL*
his
reason
.
Giving
him
an
opiate
and
enjoining
that
he
should
be
kept
*NL*
perfectly
quiet
,
the
doctor
left
the
room
,
sought
the
principal
,
and
*NL*
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Bascom
,
here
is
a
case
that
baffles
my
skill
.
I
saw
that
boy
pass
*NL*
by
my
window
not
more
than
half
an
hour
ago
,
full
of
animation
,
and
now
*NL*
he
lies
hovering
between
life
and
death
.
I
have
great
apprehension
for
*NL*
his
reason
.
Can
you
throw
any
light
on
the
subject
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bascom
hesitated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
asking
you
as
a
matter
of
idle
curiosity
,
but
as
a
physician
.
*NL*
I
must
have
all
the
light
I
can
get
in
making
my
diagnosis
of
the
case
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
principal
arose
,
went
to
his
desk
,
took
out
the
letter
which
he
had
*NL*
picked
up
from
the
floor
,
and
laid
it
in
the
physician
's
hand
.
As
the
*NL*
doctor
read
,
a
look
of
indignant
horror
swept
over
his
face
.
Then
he
*NL*
said
:
``
Can
it
be
possible
!
I
never
suspected
such
a
thing
.
It
must
be
a
*NL*
cruel
,
senseless
hoax
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doctor
,
''
said
Mr.
Bascom
,
``
I
have
been
a
life-long
Abolitionist
and
*NL*
have
often
read
of
the
cruelties
and
crimes
of
American
slavery
,
but
*NL*
never
before
did
I
realize
the
low
moral
tone
of
the
social
life
under
*NL*
which
such
shameless
cruelties
could
be
practiced
on
a
defenseless
widow
*NL*
and
her
orphaned
children
.
Let
me
read
the
letter
again
.
Just
look
at
*NL*
it
,
all
tear-blotted
and
written
with
a
trembling
hand
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
DEAR
BROTHER
:
--
I
have
dreadful
news
for
you
and
I
hardly
know
how
*NL*
to
tell
it
.
Papa
and
Gracie
are
both
dead
.
He
died
of
yellow
fever
.
*NL*
Mamma
is
almost
distracted
.
Papa
's
cousin
has
taken
possession
of
*NL*
our
property
,
and
instead
of
heirs
we
are
chattels
.
Mamma
has
*NL*
explained
the
whole
situation
to
me
.
She
was
papa
's
slave
before
she
*NL*
married
.
He
loved
her
,
manumitted
,
educated
,
and
married
her
.
When
*NL*
he
died
Mr.
Lorraine
entered
suit
for
his
property
and
Judge
*NL*
Starkins
has
decided
in
his
favor
.
The
decree
of
the
court
has
made
*NL*
their
marriage
invalid
,
robbed
us
of
our
inheritance
,
and
remanded
*NL*
us
all
to
slavery
.
Mamma
is
too
wretched
to
attempt
to
write
*NL*
herself
,
but
told
me
to
entreat
you
not
to
attempt
to
come
home
.
You
*NL*
can
do
us
no
good
,
and
that
mean
,
cruel
Lorraine
may
do
you
much
*NL*
harm
.
Do
n't
attempt
,
I
beseech
you
,
to
come
home
.
Show
this
letter
*NL*
to
Mr.
Bascom
and
let
him
advise
you
what
to
do
.
But
do
n't
,
for
our
*NL*
sake
,
attempt
to
come
home
.

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
,
''
said
the
doctor
,
``
is
a
very
awkward
affair
.
The
boy
is
too
ill
*NL*
to
be
removed
.
It
is
doubtful
if
the
nerves
which
have
trembled
with
*NL*
such
fearful
excitement
will
ever
recover
their
normal
condition
.
It
is
*NL*
simply
a
work
of
mercy
to
watch
over
him
with
the
tenderest
care
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fortunately
for
Harry
he
had
fallen
into
good
hands
,
and
the
most
tender
*NL*
care
and
nursing
were
bestowed
upon
him
.
For
awhile
Harry
was
strangely
*NL*
silent
,
never
referring
to
the
terrible
misfortune
which
had
so
suddenly
*NL*
overshadowed
his
life
.
It
seemed
as
if
the
past
were
suddenly
blotted
*NL*
out
of
his
memory
.
But
he
was
young
and
of
an
excellent
constitution
,
*NL*
and
in
a
few
months
he
was
slowly
recovering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doctor
,
''
said
he
one
day
,
as
the
physician
sat
at
his
bedside
,
``
I
seem
*NL*
to
have
had
a
dreadful
dream
,
and
to
have
dreamt
that
my
father
was
*NL*
dead
,
and
my
mother
and
sister
were
in
terrible
trouble
,
but
I
could
not
*NL*
help
them
.
Doctor
,
was
it
a
dream
,
or
was
it
a
reality
?
It
could
not
*NL*
have
been
a
dream
,
for
when
I
fell
asleep
the
grass
was
green
and
the
*NL*
birds
were
singing
,
but
now
the
winds
are
howling
and
the
frost
is
on
*NL*
the
ground
.
Doctor
,
tell
me
how
it
is
?
How
long
have
I
been
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sitting
by
his
bedside
,
and
taking
his
emaciated
hand
in
his
,
the
doctor
*NL*
said
,
in
a
kind
,
fatherly
tone
:
``
My
dear
boy
,
you
have
been
very
ill
,
*NL*
and
everything
depends
on
your
keeping
quiet
,
very
quiet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
he
was
strong
enough
the
principal
gave
him
his
letter
to
*NL*
read
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Mr.
Bascom
,
''
Harry
said
,
``
I
do
not
understand
this
.
It
says
my
*NL*
mother
and
father
were
legally
married
.
How
could
her
marriage
be
set
*NL*
aside
and
her
children
robbed
of
their
inheritance
?
This
is
not
a
*NL*
heathen
country
.
I
hardly
think
barbarians
would
have
done
any
worse
;
*NL*
yet
this
is
called
a
Christian
country
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Christian
in
name
,
''
answered
the
principal
.
``
When
your
father
left
you
*NL*
in
my
care
,
knowing
that
I
was
an
Abolitionist
,
he
confided
his
secret
*NL*
to
me
.
He
said
that
life
was
full
of
vicissitudes
,
and
he
wished
you
to
*NL*
have
a
good
education
.
He
wanted
you
and
your
sister
to
be
prepared
for
*NL*
any
emergency
.
He
did
not
wish
you
to
know
that
you
had
negro
blood
in
*NL*
your
veins
.
He
knew
that
the
spirit
of
caste
pervaded
the
nation
,
North
*NL*
and
South
,
and
he
was
very
anxious
to
have
his
children
freed
from
its
*NL*
depressing
influences
.
He
did
not
intend
to
stay
South
after
you
had
*NL*
finished
your
education
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
said
Harry
,
``
I
can
not
understand
.
If
my
mother
was
lawfully
*NL*
married
,
how
could
they
deprive
her
of
her
marital
rights
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
Lorraine
,
''
continued
Mr.
Bascom
,
``
knew
your
father
was
dead
,
all
*NL*
he
had
to
do
was
to
find
a
flaw
in
her
manumission
,
and
,
of
course
,
the
*NL*
marriage
became
illegal
.
She
could
not
then
inherit
property
nor
*NL*
maintain
her
freedom
;
and
her
children
followed
her
condition
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Harry
listened
attentively
.
Things
which
had
puzzled
him
once
now
became
*NL*
perfectly
clear
.
He
sighed
heavily
,
and
,
turning
to
the
principal
,
said
:
*NL*
``
I
see
things
in
a
new
light
.
Now
I
remember
that
none
of
the
planters
'
*NL*
wives
ever
visited
my
mother
;
and
we
never
went
to
church
except
when
my
*NL*
father
took
us
to
the
Cathedral
in
New
Orleans
.
My
father
was
a
*NL*
Catholic
,
but
I
do
n't
think
mamma
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Harry
,
''
said
the
principal
,
``
life
is
before
you
.
If
you
wish
to
*NL*
stay
North
,
I
will
interest
friends
in
your
behalf
,
and
try
to
get
you
a
*NL*
situation
.
Going
South
is
out
of
the
question
.
It
is
probable
that
by
*NL*
this
time
your
mother
and
sister
are
removed
from
their
home
.
You
are
*NL*
powerless
to
fight
against
the
law
that
enslaved
them
.
Should
you
fall
*NL*
into
the
clutches
of
Lorraine
,
he
might
give
you
a
great
deal
of
*NL*
trouble
.
You
would
be
pressed
into
the
Confederate
service
to
help
them
*NL*
throw
up
barricades
,
dig
trenches
,
and
add
to
the
strength
of
those
who
*NL*
enslaved
your
mother
and
sister
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
!
never
!
''
cried
Harry
.
``
I
would
rather
die
than
do
it
!
I
should
*NL*
despise
myself
forever
if
I
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Numbers
of
our
young
men
,
''
said
Mr.
Bascom
,
``
have
gone
to
the
war
which
*NL*
is
now
raging
between
North
and
South
.
You
have
been
sick
for
several
*NL*
months
,
and
much
has
taken
place
of
which
you
are
unaware
.
Would
you
*NL*
like
to
enlist
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
certainly
would
;
not
so
much
for
the
sake
of
fighting
for
the
*NL*
Government
,
as
with
the
hope
of
finding
my
mother
and
sister
,
and
*NL*
avenging
their
wrongs
.
I
should
like
to
meet
Lorraine
on
the
*NL*
battle-field
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
kind
of
a
regiment
would
you
prefer
,
white
or
colored
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Harry
winced
when
the
question
was
asked
.
He
felt
the
reality
of
his
*NL*
situation
as
he
had
not
done
before
.
It
was
as
if
two
paths
had
suddenly
*NL*
opened
before
him
,
and
he
was
forced
to
choose
between
them
.
On
one
side
*NL*
were
strength
,
courage
,
enterprise
,
power
of
achievement
,
and
memories
*NL*
of
a
wonderful
past
.
On
the
other
side
were
weakness
,
ignorance
,
*NL*
poverty
,
and
the
proud
world
's
social
scorn
.
He
knew
nothing
of
colored
*NL*
people
except
as
slaves
,
and
his
whole
soul
shrank
from
equalizing
*NL*
himself
with
them
.
He
was
fair
enough
to
pass
unchallenged
among
the
*NL*
fairest
in
the
land
,
and
yet
a
Christless
prejudice
had
decreed
that
he
*NL*
should
be
a
social
pariah
.
He
sat
,
thoughtful
and
undecided
,
as
if
a
*NL*
great
struggle
were
going
on
in
his
mind
.
Finally
the
principal
said
,
``
I
*NL*
do
not
think
that
you
should
be
assigned
to
a
colored
regiment
because
*NL*
of
the
blood
in
your
veins
,
but
you
will
have
,
in
such
a
regiment
,
*NL*
better
facilities
for
finding
your
mother
and
sister
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right
,
Mr.
Bascom
.
To
find
my
mother
and
sister
I
call
no
task
*NL*
too
heavy
,
no
sacrifice
too
great
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Since
Harry
had
come
North
he
had
learned
to
feel
profound
pity
for
the
*NL*
slave
.
But
there
is
a
difference
between
looking
on
a
man
as
an
object
*NL*
of
pity
and
protecting
him
as
such
,
and
being
identified
with
him
and
*NL*
forced
to
share
his
lot
.
To
take
his
place
with
them
on
the
arena
of
*NL*
life
was
the
test
of
his
life
,
but
love
was
stronger
than
pride
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
father
was
dead
.
His
mother
and
sister
were
enslaved
by
a
mockery
of
*NL*
justice
.
It
was
more
than
a
matter
of
choice
where
he
should
stand
on
*NL*
the
racial
question
.
He
felt
that
he
must
stand
where
he
could
strike
*NL*
the
most
effective
blow
for
their
freedom
.
With
that
thought
strong
in
*NL*
his
mind
,
and
as
soon
as
he
recovered
,
he
went
westward
to
find
a
*NL*
colored
regiment
.
He
told
the
recruiting
officer
that
he
wished
to
be
*NL*
assigned
to
a
colored
regiment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
wish
that
,
''
said
the
officer
,
looking
at
Harry
with
an
air
*NL*
of
astonishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
am
a
colored
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
officer
look
puzzled
.
It
was
a
new
experience
.
He
had
seen
colored
*NL*
men
with
fair
complexions
anxious
to
lose
their
identity
with
the
*NL*
colored
race
and
pose
as
white
men
,
but
here
was
a
man
in
the
flush
of
*NL*
his
early
manhood
,
to
whom
could
come
dreams
of
promotion
from
a
simple
*NL*
private
to
a
successful
general
,
deliberately
turning
his
back
upon
*NL*
every
gilded
hope
and
dazzling
opportunity
,
to
cast
his
lot
with
the
*NL*
despised
and
hated
negro
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
understand
you
,
''
said
the
officer
.
``
Surely
you
are
a
white
*NL*
man
,
and
,
as
such
,
I
will
enlist
you
in
a
white
regiment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Harry
,
firmly
,
``
I
am
a
colored
man
,
and
unless
I
can
be
*NL*
assigned
to
a
colored
regiment
I
am
not
willing
to
enter
the
army
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
the
officer
,
``
you
are
the
d
--
d'st
fool
I
ever
saw
--
a
man
*NL*
as
white
as
you
are
turning
his
back
upon
his
chances
of
promotion
!
But
*NL*
you
can
take
your
choice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
Harry
was
permitted
to
enter
the
army
.
By
his
promptness
and
valor
he
*NL*
soon
won
the
hearts
of
his
superior
officers
,
and
was
made
drill
*NL*
sergeant
.
Having
nearly
all
of
his
life
been
used
to
colored
people
,
and
*NL*
being
taught
by
his
mother
to
be
kind
and
respectful
to
them
,
he
was
*NL*
soon
able
to
gain
their
esteem
.
He
continued
in
the
regiment
until
Grant
*NL*
began
the
task
of
opening
the
Mississippi
.
After
weeks
of
fruitless
*NL*
effort
,
Grant
marched
his
army
down
the
west
side
of
the
river
,
while
*NL*
the
gunboats
undertook
the
perilous
task
of
running
the
batteries
.
Men
*NL*
were
found
for
the
hour
.
The
volunteers
offered
themselves
in
such
*NL*
numbers
that
lots
were
cast
to
determine
who
should
have
the
opportunity
*NL*
to
enlist
in
an
enterprise
so
fraught
with
danger
.
Harry
was
one
on
whom
*NL*
the
lot
fell
.
*NL*
*NL*
Grant
crossed
the
river
below
,
coiled
his
forces
around
Vicksburg
like
*NL*
a
boa-constrictor
,
and
held
it
in
his
grasp
.
After
forty-seven
days
of
*NL*
endurance
the
city
surrendered
to
him
.
Port
Hudson
,
after
the
surrender
*NL*
of
Vicksburg
,
gave
up
the
unequal
contest

the
Mississippi
was
open

ROBERT
AND
HIS
COMPANY
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
morning
,
gentlemen
,
''
said
Robert
Johnson
,
as
he
approached
Colonel
*NL*
Robinson
,
the
commander
of
the
post
,
who
was
standing
at
the
door
of
his
*NL*
tent
,
talking
with
Captain
Sybil
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
morning
,
''
responded
Colonel
Robinson
,
``
I
am
glad
you
have
come
.
I
*NL*
was
just
about
to
send
for
you
.
How
is
your
company
getting
on
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
First
rate
,
sir
,
''
replied
Robert
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
good
health
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excellent
.
They
are
all
in
good
health
and
spirits
.
Our
boys
are
used
*NL*
to
hardship
and
exposure
,
and
the
hope
of
getting
their
freedom
puts
new
*NL*
snap
into
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
of
it
,
''
said
Colonel
Robinson
.
``
They
make
good
fighters
and
*NL*
very
useful
allies
.
Last
night
we
received
very
valuable
intelligence
*NL*
from
some
fugitives
who
had
escaped
through
the
Rebel
lines
.
I
do
not
*NL*
think
many
of
the
Northern
people
realize
the
service
they
have
been
to
*NL*
us
in
bringing
information
and
helping
our
boys
when
escaping
from
Rebel
*NL*
prisons
.
I
never
knew
a
full-blooded
negro
to
betray
us
.
A
month
ago
,
*NL*
when
we
were
encamped
near
the
Rebel
lines
,
a
colored
woman
managed
*NL*
admirably
to
keep
us
posted
as
to
the
intended
movements
of
the
enemy
.
*NL*
She
was
engaged
in
laundry
work
,
and
by
means
of
hanging
her
sheets
in
*NL*
different
ways
gave
us
the
right
signals
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
,
''
said
Captain
Sybil
,
``
that
the
time
will
come
when
some
*NL*
faithful
historian
will
chronicle
all
the
deeds
of
daring
and-service
*NL*
these
people
have
performed
during
this
struggle
,
and
give
them
due
*NL*
credit
therefor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
great
mistake
,
''
said
Colonel
Robinson
,
``
was
our
long
delay
in
*NL*
granting
them
their
freedom
,
and
even
what
we
have
done
is
only
partial
.
*NL*
The
border
States
still
retain
their
slaves
.
We
ought
to
have
made
a
*NL*
clean
sweep
of
the
whole
affair
.
Slavery
is
a
serpent
which
we
nourished
*NL*
in
its
weakness
,
and
now
it
is
stinging
us
in
its
strength
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
so
,
too
,
''
said
Captain
Sybil
.
``
But
in
making
his
proclamation
*NL*
of
freedom
,
perhaps
Mr.
Lincoln
went
as
far
as
he
thought
public
opinion
*NL*
would
let
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
remarkable
,
''
said
Colonel
Robinson
,
``
how
these
Secesh
hold
out
.
*NL*
It
surprises
me
to
see
how
poor
white
men
,
who
,
like
the
negroes
,
are
*NL*
victims
of
slavery
,
rally
around
the
Stripes
and
Bars
.
These
men
,
I
*NL*
believe
,
have
been
looked
down
on
by
the
aristocratic
slaveholders
,
and
*NL*
despised
by
the
well-fed
and
comfortable
slaves
,
yet
they
follow
their
*NL*
leaders
into
the
very
jaws
of
death
;
face
hunger
,
cold
,
disease
,
and
*NL*
danger
;
and
all
for
what
?
What
,
under
heaven
,
are
they
fighting
for
?
*NL*
Now
,
the
negro
,
ignorant
as
he
is
,
has
learned
to
regard
our
flag
as
a
*NL*
banner
of
freedom
,
and
to
look
forward
to
his
deliverance
as
a
*NL*
consequence
of
the
overthrow
of
the
Rebellion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
,
''
said
Captain
Sybil
``
that
these
ignorant
white
men
have
been
*NL*
awfully
deceived
.
They
have
had
presented
to
their
imaginations
utterly
*NL*
false
ideas
of
the
results
of
Secession
,
and
have
been
taught
that
its
*NL*
success
would
bring
them
advantages
which
they
had
never
enjoyed
in
the
*NL*
Union
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
think
,
''
said
Colonel
Robinson
,
``
that
the
women
and
ministers
have
*NL*
largely
fed
and
fanned
the
fires
of
this
Rebellion
,
and
have
helped
to
*NL*
create
a
public
opinion
which
has
swept
numbers
of
benighted
men
into
*NL*
the
conflict
.
Well
might
one
of
their
own
men
say
,
`
This
is
a
rich
man
's
*NL*
war
and
a
poor
man
's
fight
.
'
They
were
led
into
it
through
their
*NL*
ignorance
,
and
held
in
it
by
their
fears
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
,
''
said
Captain
Sybil
,
``
that
if
the
public
school
had
been
*NL*
common
through
the
South
this
war
would
never
have
occurred
.
Now
things
*NL*
have
reached
such
a
pass
that
able-bodied
men
must
report
at
*NL*
headquarters
,
or
be
treated
as
deserters
.
Their
leaders
are
desperate
*NL*
men
,
of
whom
it
has
been
said
:
`
They
have
robbed
the
cradle
and
the
*NL*
grave
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
fighting
against
fearful
odds
,
''
said
Colonel
Robinson
,
``
and
*NL*
their
defeat
is
only
a
question
of
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
soon
,
''
said
Robert
,
``
as
they
fired
on
Fort
Sumter
,
Uncle
Daniel
,
a
*NL*
dear
old
father
who
had
been
praying
and
hoping
for
freedom

said
to
me
:

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Had
we
freed
the
slaves
at
the
outset
,
''
said
Captain
Sybil
,
``
we
*NL*
would
n't
have
given
the
Rebels
so
much
opportunity
to
strengthen
*NL*
themselves
by
means
of
slave
labor
in
raising
their
crops
,
throwing
up
*NL*
their
entrenchments
,
and
building
their
fortifications
.
Slavery
was
a
*NL*
deadly
cancer
eating
into
the
life
of
the
nation
;
but
,
somehow
,
it
had
*NL*
cast
such
a
glamour
over
us
that
we
have
acted
somewhat
as
if
our
*NL*
national
safety
were
better
preserved
by
sparing
the
cancer
than
by
*NL*
cutting
it
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Political
and
racial
questions
have
sadly
complicated
this
matter
,
''
*NL*
said
Colonel
Robinson
.
``
The
North
is
not
wholly
made
up
of
anti-slavery
*NL*
people
.
At
the
beginning
of
this
war
we
were
not
permeated
with
justice
,
*NL*
and
so
were
not
ripe
for
victory
.
The
battle
of
Bull
Run
inaugurated
the
*NL*
war
by
a
failure
.
Instead
of
glory
we
gathered
shame
,
and
defeat
in
*NL*
place
of
victory
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
been
slow
,
''
said
Captain
Sybil
,
``
to
see
our
danger
and
to
do
*NL*
our
duty

Our
delay
has
cost
us
thousands
of
lives
and
millions
of
*NL*
dollars
.
Yet
it
may
be
it
is
all
for
the
best
.
Our
national
wound
was
*NL*
too
deep
to
be
lightly
healed
.
When
the
President
issued
his
*NL*
Emancipation
Proclamation
my
heart
overflowed
with
joy
,
and
I
said
:
*NL*
`
This
is
the
first
bright
rift
in
the
war
cloud
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
did
you
really
think
that
they
would
accept
the
terms
of
freedom
*NL*
and
lay
down
their
arms
?
''
asked
Robert
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hardly
thought
they
would
,
''
continued
Captain
Sybil
.
``
I
did
not
think
*NL*
that
their
leaders
would
permit
it
.
I
believe
the
rank
and
file
of
their
*NL*
army
are
largely
composed
of
a
mass
of
ignorance
,
led
,
manipulated
,
and
*NL*
moulded
by
educated
and
ambitious
wickedness
.
In
attempting
to
overthrow
*NL*
the
Union
,
a
despotism
and
reign
of
terror
were
created
which
*NL*
encompassed
them
as
fetters
of
iron
,
and
they
will
not
accept
the
*NL*
conditions
until
they
have
reached
the
last
extremity
.
I
hardly
think
*NL*
they
are
yet
willing
to
confess
that
such
extremity
has
been
reached
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Captain
,
''
said
Robert
,
as
they
left
Colonel
Robinson
's
tent
,
``
I
have
*NL*
lived
all
my
life
where
I
have
had
a
chance
to
hear
the
`
Secesh
'
talk
,
*NL*
and
when
they
left
their
papers
around
I
used
to
read
everything
I
could
*NL*
lay
my
hands
on
.
It
seemed
to
me
that
the
big
white
men
not
only
ruled
*NL*
over
the
poor
whites
and
made
laws
for
them
,
but
over
the
whole
nation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
so
,
''
replied
Captain
Sybil
.
``
The
North
was
strong
but
*NL*
forbearing
.
It
was
busy
in
trade
and
commerce
,
and
permitted
them
to
*NL*
make
the
Northern
States
hunting-grounds
for
their
slaves
.
When
we
sent
*NL*
back
Simms
and
Burns
from
beneath
the
shadow
of
Bunker
Hill
Monument
and
*NL*
Faneuil
Hall
,
they
mistook
us
;
looked
upon
us
as
a
lot
of
*NL*
money-grabbers
,
who
would
be
willing
to
purchase
peace
at
any
price
.
I
*NL*
do
not
believe
when
they
fired
on
the
`
Star
of
the
West
'
that
they
had
*NL*
the
least
apprehension
of
the
fearful
results
which
were
to
follow
their
*NL*
madness
and
folly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Captain
,
''
asked
Robert
,
``
if
the
free
North
would
submit
to
be
*NL*
called
on
to
help
them
catch
their
slaves
,
what
could
be
expected
of
us
,
*NL*
who
all
our
lives
had
known
no
other
condition
than
that
of
slavery
?
How
*NL*
much
braver
would
you
have
been
,
if
your
first
recollections
had
been
*NL*
those
of
seeing
your
mother
maltreated
,
your
father
cruelly
beaten
,
or
*NL*
your
fellow-servants
brutally
murdered
?
I
wonder
why
they
never
enslaved
*NL*
the
Indians
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
mistaken
,
Robert
,
if
you
think
the
Indians
were
never
enslaved
.
*NL*
I
have
read
that
the
Spaniards
who
visited
the
coasts
of
America
*NL*
kidnapped
thousands
of
Indians
,
whom
they
sent
to
Europe
and
the
West
*NL*
Indies
as
slaves
.
Columbus
himself
,
we
are
informed
,
captured
five
*NL*
hundred
natives
,
and
sent
them
to
Spain
.
The
Indian
had
the
lesser
power
*NL*
of
endurance
,
and
Las
Cassas
suggested
the
enslavement
of
the
negro
,
*NL*
because
he
seemed
to
possess
greater
breadth
of
physical
organization
*NL*
and
stronger
power
of
endurance
.
Slavery
was
an
old
world
's
crime
which
,
*NL*
I
have
heard
,
the
Indians
never
practiced
among
themselves
.
Perhaps
it
*NL*
would
have
been
harder
to
reduce
them
to
slavery
and
hold
them
in
*NL*
bondage
when
they
had
a
vast
continent
before
them
,
where
they
could
*NL*
hide
in
the
vastnesses
of
its
mountains
or
the
seclusion
of
its
forests
,
*NL*
than
it
was
for
white
men
to
visit
the
coasts
of
Africa
and
,
with
their
*NL*
superior
knowledge
,
obtain
cargoes
of
slaves
,
bring
them
across
the
*NL*
ocean
,
hem
them
in
on
the
plantations
,
and
surround
them
with
a
pall
of
*NL*
dense
ignorance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
remember
,
''
said
Robert
,
``
in
reading
a
history
I
once
came
across
at
*NL*
our
house
,
that
when
the
Africans
first
came
to
this
country
they
did
*NL*
not
all
speak
one
language
.
Some
had
only
met
as
mutual
enemies
.
They
*NL*
were
not
all
one
color
,
their
complexions
ranging
from
tawny
yellow
to
*NL*
deep
black
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Captain
Sybil
,
``
and
in
dealing
with
the
negro
we
wanted
his
*NL*
labor
;
in
dealing
with
the
Indian
we
wanted
his
lands
.
For
one
we
had
*NL*
weapons
of
war
;
for
the
other
we
had
real
and
invisible
chains
,
the
*NL*
coercion
of
force
,
and
the
terror
of
the
unseen
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
exactly
so
,
Captain
!
When
I
was
a
boy
I
used
to
hear
the
old
*NL*
folks
tell
what
would
happen
to
bad
people
in
another
world
;
about
the
*NL*
devil
pouring
hot
lead
down
people
's
throats
and
stirring
them
up
with
a
*NL*
pitch-fork
;
and
I
used
to
get
so
scared
that
I
would
be
afraid
to
go
to
*NL*
bed
at
night
.
I
do
n't
suppose
the
Indians
ever
heard
of
such
things
,
*NL*
or
,
if
they
had
,
I
never
heard
of
them
being
willing
to
give
away
all
*NL*
their
lands
on
earth
,
and
quietly
wait
for
a
home
in
heaven
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
surely
,
Robert
,
you
do
not
think
religion
has
degraded
the
negro
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
would
n't
say
that
.
But
a
man
is
in
a
tight
fix
when
he
takes
his
*NL*
part
,
like
Nat
Turner
or
Denmark
Veasy
,
and
is
made
to
fear
that
he
will
*NL*
be
hanged
in
this
world
and
be
burned
in
the
next
.
And
,
since
I
come
to
*NL*
think
of
it
,
we
colored
folks
used
to
get
mightily
mixed
up
about
our
*NL*
religion
.
Mr.
Gundover
had
on
his
plantation
a
real
smart
man
.
He
was
*NL*
religious
,
but
he
would
steal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Robert
,
''
queried
Sybil
,
``
how
could
he
be
religious
and
steal
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
did
n't
think
,
''
retorted
Robert
,
``
it
was
any
harm
to
steal
from
his
*NL*
master
.
I
guess
he
thought
it
was
right
to
get
from
his
master
all
he
*NL*
could
.
He
would
have
thought
it
wrong
to
steal
from
his
fellow-servants
.
*NL*
He
thought
that
downright
mean
,
but
I
would
n't
have
insured
the
lives
of
*NL*
Gundover
's
pigs
and
chickens
,
if
Uncle
Jack
got
them
in
a
tight
place
.
*NL*
One
day
there
was
a
minister
stopping
with
Mr.
Gundover
.
As
a
matter
of
*NL*
course
,
in
speaking
of
his
servants
,
he
gave
Jack
's
sins
an
airing
.
He
*NL*
would
much
rather
confess
Jack
's
sins
than
his
own
.
Now
Gundover
wanted
*NL*

He
*NL*
told
the
minister
that
Jack
was
a
liar
and
a
thief
,
and
gave
the
*NL*
minister
a
chance
to
talk
with
Uncle
Jack
about
the
state
of
his
soul
.
*NL*
Uncle
Jack
listened
very
quietly
,
and
when
taxed
with
stealing
his
*NL*
master
's
wheat
he
was
ready
with
an
answer

*NL*

but
I
do

told

When
he
came
to
the
next
*NL*
point
,
about
Jack

lying

I
suppose
he

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
did
he
clear
up
that

''
interrogated
Captain
Sybil
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Finely

I
think
if
he
had
been
educated
he
would
have
made

said

I
heard
,
continued
Robert
,
that
Mr.
Parker
said
to
*NL*
Gundover
,
`
You
seem
to
me
like
a
man
standing

where

but
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
What

asked
Captain

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
turned
pale

said
,

Judgment

'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Just
then
a
messenger
brought
a
communication
to
Captain
Sybil
.
He
read
*NL*
it
attentively
,
and
,
turning
to
Robert
,
said
,
``
Here
are
orders
for
an
*NL*
engagement

Five
Forks

Oh
,
this
wasting
of
life

*NL*
scattering

But
*NL*
the
time

Look

and
see
that
everything
is
*NL*
in
readiness
as
soon
as
possible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carefully
Robert
superintended
the
arrangements
for
the
coming
battle
of
*NL*
a
strife
which
for
years
had
thrown
its
crimson
shadows
over
the
land
.
*NL*
The
Rebels
fought
with
a
valor
worthy
of
a
better
cause
.
The
disaster
of
*NL*
Bull
Run
had
been
retrieved
.
Sherman
had
made
his
famous
march
to
the
*NL*
sea
.
Fighting
Joe
Hooker
had
scaled
the
stronghold
of
the
storm
king
and
*NL*
won
a
victory
in
the
palace
chamber
of
the
clouds
;
the
Union
soldiers
*NL*
had
captured
Columbia
,
replanted
the
Stars
and
Stripes
in
Charleston
,
*NL*
and
changed
that
old
sepulchre
of
slavery
into
the
cradle
of
a
new-born
*NL*
freedom
.
Farragut
had
been
as
triumphant
on
water
as
the
other
generals
*NL*
had
been
victorious
on
land
,
and
New
Orleans
had
been
wrenched
from
the
*NL*
hands
of
the
Confederacy
.
The
Rebel
leaders
were
obstinate
.
Misguided
*NL*
hordes
had
followed
them
to
defeat
and
death
.
Grant
was
firm
and
*NL*
determined
to
fight
it
out
if
it
took
all
summer
.
The
closing
battles
*NL*
were
fought
with
desperate
courage
and
firm
resistance
,
but
at
last
the
*NL*
South
was
forced
to
succumb
.
On
the
ninth
day
of
April
,
1865
,
General
*NL*
Lee
surrendered
to
General
Grant
.
The
lost
cause
went
down
in
blood
and
*NL*
tears
,
and
on
the
brows
of
a
ransomed
people
God
poured
the
chrism
of
a
*NL*
new
era
,
and
they
stood
a
race
newly
anointed
with
freedom
.

CHAPTER
XVI
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
AFTER
THE
BATTLE
.
*NL*
*NL*
Very
sad
and
heart-rending
were
the
scenes
with
which
Iola
came
in
*NL*
constant
contact
.
Well
may
Christian
men
and
women
labor
and
pray
for
*NL*
the
time
when
nations
shall
learn
war
no
more
;
when
,
instead
of
bloody
*NL*
conflicts
,
there
shall
be
peaceful
arbitration
.
The
battle
in
which
*NL*
Robert
fought
,
after
his
last
conversation
with
Captain
Sybil
,
was
one
*NL*
of
the
decisive
struggles
of
the
closing
conflict
.
The
mills
of
doom
and
*NL*
fate
had
ground
out
a
fearful
grist
of
agony
and
death
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
lives
of
men
and
souls
of
States
*NL*
Were
thrown
like
chaff
beyond
the
gates
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Numbers
were
taken
prisoners
.
Pale
,
young
corpses
strewed
the
earth
;
*NL*
manhood
was
stricken
down
in
the
flush
of
its
energy
and
prime
.
The
*NL*
ambulances
brought
in
the
wounded
and
dying
.
Captain
Sybil
laid
down
his
*NL*
life
on
the
altar
of
freedom
.
His
prediction
was
fulfilled
.
Robert
was
*NL*
brought
into
the
hospital
,
wounded
,
but
not
dangerously
.
Iola
remembered
*NL*
him
as
being
the
friend
of
Tom
Anderson
,
and
her
heart
was
drawn
*NL*
instinctively
towards
him
.
For
awhile
he
was
delirious
,
but
her
presence
*NL*
had
a
soothing
effect
upon
him
.
He
sometimes
imagined
that
she
was
his
*NL*
mother
,
and
he
would
tell
her
how
he
had
missed
her
;
and
then
at
times
*NL*
he
would
call
her
sister
.
Iola
,
tender
and
compassionate
,
humored
his
*NL*
fancies
,
and
would
sing
to
him
in
low
,
sweet
tones
some
of
the
hymns
*NL*
she
had
learned
in
her
old
home
in
Mississippi
.
One
day
she
sang
a
few
*NL*
verses
of
the
hymn
beginning
with
the
words
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Drooping
souls
no
longer
grieve
,
*NL*
Heaven
is
propitious
;
*NL*
If
on
Christ
you
do
believe
,
*NL*
You
will
find
Him
precious
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
,
''
said
he
,
looking
earnestly
into
Iola
's
face
,
``
was
my
mother
's
*NL*
hymn
.
I
have
not
heard
it
for
years
.
Where
did
you
learn
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Iola
gazed
inquiringly
upon
the
face
of
her
patient
,
and
saw
,
by
his
*NL*
clear
gaze
and
the
expression
of
his
face
,
that
his
reason
had
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
my
home
,
in
Mississippi
,
from
my
own
dear
mother
,
''
was
Iola
's
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
where
she
learned
it
?
''
asked
Robert
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
she
was
a
little
girl
she
heard
her
mother
sing
it
.
Years
after
,
a
*NL*
Methodist
preacher
came
to
our
house
,
sang
this
hymn
,
and
left
the
book
*NL*
behind
him
.
My
father
was
a
Catholic
,
but
my
mother
never
went
to
any
*NL*
church
.
I
did
not
understand
it
then
,
but
I
do
now
.
We
used
to
sing
*NL*
together
,
and
read
the
Bible
when
we
were
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
remember
where
she
came
from
,
and
who
was
her
mother
?
''
asked
*NL*
Robert
,
anxiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
friend
,
you
must
be
quiet
.
The
fever
has
left
you
,
but
I
will
*NL*
not
answer
for
the
consequences
if
you
get
excited
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Robert
lay
quiet
and
thoughtful
for
awhile
and
,
seeing
he
was
wakeful
,
*NL*
Iola
said
,
``
Have
you
any
friends
to
whom
you
would
like
to
send
a
*NL*
letter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
pathetic
expression
flitted
over
his
face
,
as
he
sadly
replied
,
``
I
*NL*
have
n't
,
to
my
knowledge
,
a
single
relation
in
the
world
.
When
I
was
*NL*
about
ten
years
old
my
mother
and
sister
were
sold
from
me
.
It
is
more
*NL*
than
twenty
years
since
I
have
heard
from
them
.
But
that
hymn
which
you
*NL*
were
singing
reminded
me
so
much
of
my
mother
!
She
used
to
sing
it
when
*NL*
I
was
a
child
.
Please
sing
it
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Iola
's
voice
rose
soft
and
clear
by
his
bedside
,
till
he
fell
into
a
*NL*
quiet
slumber
.
She
remembered
that
her
mother
had
spoken
of
her
brother
*NL*
before
they
had
parted
,
and
her
interest
and
curiosity
were
awakened
by
*NL*
Robert
's
story
.
While
he
slept
,
she
closely
scrutinized
Robert
's
*NL*
features
,
and
detected
a
striking
resemblance
between
him
and
her
*NL*
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
_
do
_
wonder
if
he
can
be
my
mother
's
brother
,
from
whom
she
has
*NL*
been
separated
so
many
years
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anxious
as
she
was
to
ascertain
if
there
was
any
relationship
between
*NL*
Robert
and
her
mother
,
she
forebore
to
question
him
on
the
subject
which
*NL*
lay
so
near
her
heart
.
But
one
day
,
when
he
was
so
far
recovered
as
to
*NL*
be
able
to
walk
around
,
he
met
Iola
on
the
hospital
grounds
,
and
said
to
*NL*
her
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Iola
,
you
remind
me
so
much
of
my
mother
and
sister
that
I
can
not
*NL*
help
wondering
if
you
are
the
daughter
of
my
long-lost
sister
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
,
''
asked
Iola
,
``
if
you
saw
the
likeness
of
your
sister
you
*NL*
would
recognize
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
not
.
But
there
is
one
thing
I
can
remember
about
her
:
she
*NL*
used
to
have
a
mole
on
her
cheek
,
which
mother
used
to
tell
her
was
her
*NL*
beauty
spot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
at
this
,
''
said
Iola
,
handing
him
a
locket
which
contained
her
*NL*
mother
's
picture
.
*NL*
*NL*
Robert
grasped
the
locket
eagerly
,
scanned
the
features
attentively
,
*NL*
then
,
handing
it
back
,
said
:
``
I
have
only
a
faint
remembrance
of
my
*NL*
sister
's
features
;
but
I
never
could
recognize
in
that
beautiful
woman
*NL*
the
dear
little
sister
with
whom
I
used
to
play
.
Oh
,
the
cruelty
of
*NL*
slavery
!
How
it
wrenched
and
tore
us
apart
!
Where
is
_
your
_
mother
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
can
not
tell
,
''
answered
Iola
.
``
I
left
her
in
Mississippi
.
My
*NL*
father
was
a
wealthy
Creole
planter
,
who
fell
in
love
with
my
mother
.
*NL*
She
was
his
slave
,
but
he
educated
her
in
the
North
,
freed
,
and
married
*NL*
her
.
My
father
was
very
careful
to
have
the
fact
of
our
negro
blood
*NL*
concealed
from
us
.
I
had
not
the
slightest
suspicion
of
it
.
When
he
was
*NL*
dead
the
secret
was
revealed
.
His
white
relations
set
aside
my
father
's
*NL*
will
,
had
his
marriage
declared
invalid
,
and
my
mother
and
her
children
*NL*
were
remanded
to
slavery
.
''
Iola
shuddered
as
she
pronounced
the
horrid
*NL*
word
,
and
grew
deadly
pale
;
but
,
regaining
her
self-possession
,
*NL*
continued
:
``
Now
,
that
freedom
has
come

I
intend
to
search
for
my
mother
*NL*
until
I
find
her

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
wonder

said
Robert
,
``
that
we
had
this
war

The
nation
had
*NL*
sinned
enough
to
suffer

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

said
Iola
,
``
if

judgments

then

the
nation

only
reaping
what

*NL*
*NL*
``
What

Iola

down
through
exhaustion
and
*NL*
overwork
,
and
I
was
compelled
to
go
home
for
a
few
weeks
'
rest
.
But
now
,
*NL*
as
they
are
about
to
close
the
hospital
,
I
shall
be
permanently
*NL*
relieved
.
I
am
glad
that
this
cruel
strife
is
over
.
It
seemed
as
if
I
*NL*
had
lived
through
ages
during
these
last
few
years
.
In
the
early
part
of
*NL*
the
war
I
lost
my
arm
by
a
stray
shot
,
and
my
armless
sleeve
is
one
of
*NL*
the
mementos
of
battle
I
shall
carry
with
me
through
life
.
Miss
Leroy
,
''
*NL*
he
continued
,
turning
respectfully
to
Iola
,
``
would
you
permit
me
to
ask
*NL*
you
,
as
I
would
have
someone
ask
my
sister
under
the
same
circumstances
,
*NL*
if
you
have
matured
any
plans
for
the
future
,
or
if
I
can
be
of
the
*NL*
least
service
to
you
?
If
so
,
I
would
be
pleased
to
render
you
any
*NL*
service
in
my
power
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
purpose
,
''
replied
Iola
,
``
is
to
hunt
for
my
mother
,
and
to
find
her
*NL*
if
she
is
alive
.
I
am
willing
to
go
anywhere
and
do
anything
to
find
*NL*
her
.
But
I
will
need
a
standpoint
from
whence
I
can
send
out
lines
of
*NL*
inquiry
.
It
must
take
time
,
in
the
disordered
state
of
affairs
,
even
to
*NL*
get
a
clue
by
which
I
may
discover
her
whereabouts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
would
you
like
to
teach
?
''
asked
the
Doctor
.
``
Schools
are
being
*NL*
opened
all
around
us
.
Numbers
of
excellent
and
superior
women
are
coming
*NL*
from
the
North
to
engage
as
teachers
of
the
freed
people
.
Would
you
be
*NL*
willing
to
take
a
school
among
these
people
?
I
think
it
will
be
uphill
*NL*
work
.
I
believe
it
will
take
generations
to
get
over
the
duncery
of
*NL*
slavery
.
Some
of
these
poor
fellows
who
came
into
our
camp
did
not
know
*NL*
their
right
hands
from
their
left
,
nor
their
ages
,
nor
even
the
days
of
*NL*
the
month
.
It
took
me
some
time
,
in
a
number
of
cases
,
to
understand
*NL*
their
language
.
It
saddened
my
heart
to
see
such
ignorance
.
One
day
I
*NL*
asked
one
a
question
,
and
he
answered
,
``
I
no
shum
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
he
mean
?
''
asked
Iola
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
he
did
not
see
it
,
''
replied
the
doctor
.
``
Of
course
,
this
does
not
*NL*
apply
to
all
of
them
.
Some
of
them
are
wide-awake
and
sharp
as
steel
*NL*
traps
.
I
think
some
of
that
class
may
be
used
in
helping
others
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
be
very
glad
to
have
an
opportunity
to
teach
,
''
said
Iola
.
``
I
*NL*
used
to
be
a
great
favorite
among
the
colored
children
on
my
father
's
*NL*
plantation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
few
days
after
this
conversation
the
hospital
was
closed
.
The
sick
*NL*
and
convalescent
were
removed
,
and
Iola
obtained
a
position
as
a
*NL*
teacher
.
Very
soon
Iola
realized
that
while
she
was
heartily
appreciated
*NL*
by
the
freedmen
,
she
was
an
object
of
suspicion
and
dislike
to
their
*NL*
former
owners
.
The
North
had
conquered
by
the
supremacy
of
the
sword
,
*NL*
and
the
South
had
bowed
to
the
inevitable
.
But
here
was
a
new
army
that
*NL*
had
come
with
an
invasion
of
ideas
,
that
had
come
to
supplant
ignorance
*NL*
with
knowledge
,
and
it
was
natural
that
its
members
should
be
unwelcome
*NL*
to
those
who
had
made
it
a
crime
to
teach
their
slaves
to
read
the
name
*NL*
of
the
ever
blessed
Christ
.
But
Iola
had
found
her
work
,
and
the
freed
*NL*
men
their
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Iola
opened
her
school
she
took
pains
to
get
acquainted
with
the
*NL*
parents
of
the
children
,
and
she
gained
their
confidence
and
*NL*
co-operation
.
Her
face
was
a
passport
to
their
hearts
.
Ignorant
of
*NL*
books
,
human
faces
were
the
scrolls
from
which
they
had
been
reading
for
*NL*
ages
.
They
had
been
the
sunshine
and
shadow
of
their
lives
.
*NL*
*NL*
Iola
had
found
a
school-room
in
the
basement
of
a
colored
church
,
where
*NL*
the
doors
were
willingly
opened
to
her
.
Her
pupils
came
from
miles
*NL*
around
,
ready
and
anxious
to
get
some
``
book
larnin
'
.
''
Some
of
the
old
*NL*
folks
were
eager
to
learn
,
and
it
was
touching
to
see
the
eyes
which
had
*NL*
grown
dim
under
the
shadows
of
slavery
,
donning
spectacles
and
trying
to
*NL*
make
out
the
words
.
As
Iola
had
nearly
all
of
her
life
been
accustomed
*NL*
to
colored
children
she
had
no
physical
repulsions
to
overcome
,
no
*NL*
prejudices
to
conquer
in
dealing
with
parents
and
children
.
In
their
*NL*
simple
childish
fashion
they
would
bring
her
fruits
and
flowers
,
and
*NL*
gladden
her
lonely
heart
with
little
tokens
of
affection
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
a
gentleman
came
to
the
school
and
wished
to
address
the
*NL*
children
.
Iola
suspended
the
regular
order
of
the
school
,
and
the
*NL*
gentleman
essayed
to
talk
to
them
on
the
achievements
of
the
white
race
,
*NL*
such
as
building
steamboats
and
carrying
on
business
.
Finally
,
he
asked
*NL*
how
they
did
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
've
got
money
,
''
chorused
the
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
did
they
get
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
took
it
from
us
,
''
chimed
the
youngsters
.
Iola
smiled
,
and
the
*NL*
gentleman
was
nonplussed
;
but
he
could
not
deny
that
one
of
the
powers
*NL*
of
knowledge
is
the
power
of
the
strong
to
oppress
the
weak
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
school
was
soon
overcrowded
with
applicants
,
and
Iola
was
forced
to
*NL*
refuse
numbers
,
because
their
quarters
were
too
cramped
.
The
school
was
*NL*
beginning
to
lift
up
the
home
,
for
Iola
was
not
satisfied
to
teach
her
*NL*
children
only
the
rudiments
of
knowledge
.
She
had
tried
to
lay
the
*NL*
foundation
of
good
character
.
But
the
elements
of
evil
burst
upon
her
*NL*
loved
and
cherished
work
.
One
night
the
heavens
were
lighted
with
lurid
*NL*
flames
,
and
Iola
beheld
the
school
,
the
pride
and
joy
of
her
pupils
and
*NL*
their
parents
,
a
smouldering
ruin
.
Iola
gazed
with
sorrowful
dismay
on
*NL*
what
seemed
the
cruel
work
of
an
incendiary
's
torch
.
While
she
sat
,
*NL*
mournfully
contemplating
the
work
of
destruction
,
her
children
formed
a
*NL*
procession
,
and
,
passing
by
the
wreck
of
their
school
,
sang
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
not
be
discouraged
,
*NL*
For
Jesus
is
your
friend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
sang
,
the
tears
sprang
to
Iola
's
eyes
,
and
she
said
to
herself
,
*NL*
``
I
am
not
despondent
of
the
future
of
my
people
;
there
is
too
much
*NL*
elasticity
in
their
spirits
,
too
much
hope
in
their
hearts
,
to
be
*NL*
crushed
out
by
unreasoning
malice
.

CHAPTER
XVIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
SEARCHING
FOR
LOST
ONES
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
bind
anew
the
ties
which
slavery
had
broken
and
gather
together
the
*NL*
remnants
of
his
scattered
family
became
the
earnest
purpose
of
Robert
's
*NL*
life
.
Iola
,
hopeful
that
in
Robert
she
had
found
her
mother
's
brother
,
*NL*
was
glad
to
know
she
was
not
alone
in
_
her
_
search
.
Having
sent
out
*NL*
lines
of
inquiry
in
different
directions
,
she
was
led
to
hope
,
from
some
*NL*
of
the
replies
she
had
received
,
that
her
mother
was
living
somewhere
in
*NL*
Georgia
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hearing
that
a
Methodist
conference
was
to
convene
in
that
State
,
and
*NL*
being
acquainted
with
the
bishop
of
that
district
,
she
made
arrangements
*NL*
to
accompany
him
thither
.
She
hoped
to
gather
some
tidings
of
her
mother
*NL*
through
the
ministers
gathered
from
different
parts
of
that
State
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
her
brother
she
had
heard
nothing
since
her
father
's
death
.
On
his
*NL*
way
to
the
conference
,
the
bishop
had
an
engagement
to
dedicate
a
*NL*
church
,
near
the
city
of
C
--
,
in
North
Carolina
.
Iola
was
quite
*NL*
willing
to
stop
there
a
few
days
,
hoping
to
hear
something
of
Robert
*NL*
Johnson
's
mother
.
Soon
after
she
had
seated
herself
in
the
cars
she
was
*NL*
approached
by
a
gentleman
,
who
reached
out
his
hand
to
her
,
and
greeted
*NL*
her
with
great
cordiality
.
Iola
looked
up
,
and
recognized
him
*NL*
immediately
as
one
of
her
last
patients
at
the
hospital
.
It
was
none
*NL*
other
than
Robert
Johnson
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
so
glad
to
meet
you
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
am
on
my
way
to
C
--
in
search
*NL*
of
my
mother
.
I
want
to
see
the
person
who
sold
her
last
,
and
,
if
*NL*
possible
,
get
some
clew
to
the
direction
in
which
she
went
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
,
''
said
Iola
,
``
am
in
search
of
_
my
_
mother
.
I
am
convinced
that
*NL*
when
we
find
those
for
whom
we
are
searching
they
will
prove
to
be
very
*NL*
nearly
related
.
Mamma
said
,
before
we
were
parted
,
that
her
brother
had
*NL*
a
red
spot
on
his
temple
.
If
I
could
see
that
spot
I
should
rest
assured
*NL*
that
my
mother
is
your
sister
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
said
Robert
,
``
I
can
give
you
that
assurance
,
''
and
smilingly
he
*NL*
lifted
his
hair
from
his
temple
,
on
which
was
a
large
,
red
spot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
satisfied
,
''
exclaimed
Iola
,
fixing
her
eyes
,
beaming
with
hope
and
*NL*
confidence
,
on
Robert
.
``
Oh
,
I
am
so
glad
that
I
can
,
without
the
least
*NL*
hesitation
,
accept
your
services
to
join
with
me
in
the
further
search
.
*NL*
What
are
your
plans
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
stop
for
awhile
in
C
--
,
''
said
Robert
,
``
and
gather
all
the
*NL*
information
possible
from
those
who
sold
and
bought
my
mother
.
I
intend
*NL*
to
leave
no
stone
un-turned
in
searching
for
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
_
do
_
hope
that
you
will
succeed
.
I
expect
to
stop
over
there
a
*NL*
few
days
,
and
I
shall
be
so
glad
if
,
before
I
leave
,
I
hear
your
search
*NL*
has
been
crowned
with
success
,
or
,
a
least
,
that
you
have
been
put
on
*NL*
the
right
track
.
Although
I
was
born
and
raised
in
the
midst
of
*NL*
slavery
,
I
had
not
the
least
idea
of
its
barbarous
selfishness
till
I
*NL*
was
forced
to
pass
through
it
.
But
we
lived
so
much
alone
I
had
no
*NL*
opportunity
to
study
it
,
except
on
our
own
plantation
.
My
father
and
*NL*
mother
were
very
kind
to
their
slaves
.
But
it
was
slavery
,
all
the
same
,
*NL*
and
I
hate
it
,
root
and
branch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Just
then
the
conductor
called
out
the
station
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
stop
here
,
''
said
Robert
.
``
I
am
going
to
see
Mrs.
Johnson
,
and
hunt
*NL*
up
some
of
my
old
acquaintances

Where
do
you
stop

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
replied
Iola
.
``
I
expect
that
friends
will
be
here

meet
us

Bishop
B

,
permit

you
to
Mr.
Robert
Johnson

I
have
every
reason

Like
myself

*NL*
he
is
engaged
in
hunting
up
his
lost
relatives

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
,
''
said
Robert
,
``
am
very
much
pleased

not

without
favorable
clues

*NL*
*NL*
``
Bishop

said
Iola
,
``
Mr.
Johnson
wishes

know
where
I
am

He
*NL*
is
going
on
an
exploring
expedition

and
wishes
to
let
me
know
the
*NL*
result
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
stop
at
Mrs.
Allston
's
,
313
New
Street
,
''
said
the
bishop
.
``
If
I
can
*NL*
be
of
any
use
to
you
,
I
am
at
your
service
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
''
said
Robert
,
lifting
his
hat
,
as
he
left
them
to
pursue
his
*NL*
inquiries
about
his
long-lost
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
Quickly
he
trod
the
old
familiar
streets
which
led
to
his
former
home
.
*NL*
He
found
Mrs.
Johnson
,
but
she
had
aged
very
fast
since
the
war
.
She
was
*NL*
no
longer
the
lithe
,
active
woman
,
with
her
proud
manner
and
resolute
*NL*
bearing
.
Her
eye
had
lost
its
brightness
,
her
step
its
elasticity
,
and
*NL*
her
whole
appearance
indicated
that
she
was
slowly
sinking
beneath
a
*NL*
weight
of
sorrow
which
was
heavier
far
than
her
weight
of
years
.
When
*NL*
she
heard
that
Robert
had
called
to
see
her
she
was
going
to
receive
him
*NL*
in
the
hall
,
as
she
would
have
done
any
of
her
former
slaves
,
but
her
*NL*
mind
immediately
changed
when
she
saw
him
.
He
was
not
the
light-hearted
,
*NL*
careless
,
mischief-loving
Robby
of
former
days
,
but
a
handsome
man
,
*NL*
with
heavy
moustache
,
dark
,
earnest
eyes
,
and
proud
military
bearing
.
He
*NL*
smiled
,
and
reached
out
his
hand
to
her
.
She
hardly
knew
how
to
address
*NL*
him
.
To
her
colored
people
were
either
boys
and
girls
,
or
``
aunties
and
*NL*
uncles
.
''
She
had
never
in
her
life
addressed
a
colored
person
as
``
Mr.
or
*NL*
Mrs.
''
To
do
so
now
was
to
violate
the
social
customs
of
the
place
.
It
*NL*
would
be
like
learning
a
new
language
in
her
old
age
.
Robert
immediately
*NL*
set
her
at
ease
by
addressing
her
under
the
old
familiar
name
of
``
Miss
*NL*
Nancy
.
''
This
immediately
relieved
her
of
all
embarrassment
.
She
invited
*NL*
him
into
the
sitting-room
,
and
gave
him
a
warm
welcome
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Robby
,
''
she
said
,
``
I
once
thought
that
you
would
have
been
the
*NL*
last
one
to
leave
me
.
You
know
I
never
ill-treated
you
,
and
I
gave
you
*NL*
everything
you
needed
.
People
said
that
I
was
spoiling
you
.
I
thought
*NL*
you
were
as
happy
as
the
days
were
long
.
When
I
heard
of
other
people
's
*NL*
servants
leaving
them
I
used
to
say
to
myself
,
'
I
can
trust
my
Bobby
;
he
*NL*
will
stick
to
me
to
the
last
.
'
But
I
fooled
myself
that
time
.
Soon
as
*NL*
the
Yankee
soldiers
got
in
sight
you
left
me
without
saying
a
word
.
That
*NL*
morning
I
came
down
into
the
kitchen
and
asked
Linda
,
`
Where
's
Robert
?
*NL*
Why
has
n't
he
set
the
table
?
'
She
said
`
she
had
n't
seen
you
since
the
*NL*
night
before
.
'
I
thought
maybe
you
were
sick
,
and
I
went
to
see
,
but
you
*NL*
were
not
in
your
room
.
I
could
n't
believe
at
first
that
you
were
gone
.
*NL*
Was
n't
I
always
good
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Miss
Nancy
,
''
replied
Robert
;
``
you
were
good
,
but
freedom
was
*NL*
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
said
,
musingly
,
``
I
suppose
I
would
have
done
the
same
.
But
,
*NL*
Robby
,
it
did
go
hard
with
me
at
first
.
However
,
I
soon
found
out
that
*NL*
my
neighbors
had
been
going
through
the
same
thing
.
But
its
all
over
*NL*
now
.
Let
by-gones
be
by-gones
.
What
are
you
doing
now
,
and
where
are
*NL*
you
living
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
living
in
the
city
of
P
--
.
I
have
opened
a
hardware
store
there
.
*NL*
But
just
now
I
am
in
search
of
my
mother
and
sister
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
that
you
may
find
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
long
,
''
asked
Robert
,
``
do
you
think
it
has
been
since
they
left
*NL*
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
see
;
it
must
have
been
nearly
thirty
years
.
You
got
my
letter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
ma'am
;
thank
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
have
been
great
changes
since
you
left
here
,
''
Mrs.
Johnson
said
.
*NL*
``
Gundover
died
,
and
a
number
of
colored
men
have
banded
together
,
bought
*NL*
his
plantation
,
and
divided
it
among
themselves
.
And
I
hear
they
have
a
*NL*
very
nice
settlement
out
there
.
I
hope
,
since
the
Government
has
set
*NL*
them
free
,
that
they
will
succeed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
Robert
's
interview
with
Mrs.
Johnson
he
thought
he
would
visit
the
*NL*
settlement
and
hunt
up
his
old
friends
.
He
easily
found
the
place
.
It
*NL*
was
on
a
clearing
in
Gundover
's
woods
,
where
Robert
and
Uncle
Daniel
had
*NL*
held
their
last
prayer-meeting
.
Now
the
gloomy
silence
of
those
woods
*NL*
was
broken
by
the
hum
of
industry
,
the
murmur
of
cheerful
voices
,
and
*NL*
the
merry
laughter
of
happy
children
.
Where
they
had
trodden
with
fear
*NL*
and
misgiving
,
freedmen
walked
with
light
and
bounding
hearts
.
The
*NL*
school-house
had
taken
the
place
of
the
slave-pen
and
auction-block
.
*NL*
``
How
is
yer
,
ole
boy
?
''
asked
one
laborer
of
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything
is
lobly
,
''
replied
the
other
.
The
blue
sky
arching
overhead
*NL*
and
the
beauty
of
the
scenery
justified
the
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gundover
had
died
soon
after
the
surrender
.
Frank
Anderson
had
grown
*NL*
reckless
and
drank
himself
to
death
.
His
brother
Tom
had
been
killed
in
*NL*
battle
.
Their
mother
,
who
was
Gundover
's
daughter
,
had
died
insane
.
*NL*
Their
father
had
also
passed
away
.
The
defeat
of
the
Confederates
,
the
*NL*
loss
of
his
sons
,
and
the
emancipation
of
his
slaves
,
were
blows
from
*NL*
which
he
never
recovered
.
As
Robert
passed
leisurely
along
,
delighted
*NL*
with
the
evidences
of
thrift
and
industry
which
constantly
met
his
eye
,
*NL*
he
stopped
to
admire
a
garden
filled
with
beautiful
flowers
,
clambering
*NL*
vines
,
and
rustic
adornments
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
porch
sat
an
elderly
woman
,
darning
stockings
,
the
very
*NL*
embodiment
of
content
and
good
humor
.
Robert
looked
inquiringly
at
her
.
*NL*
On
seeing
him
,
she
almost
immediately
exclaimed
,
``
Shore

I
`
se

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``

Robert

seating

drinking

the

of

which
she
had
handed
him
,

STRIKING
CONTRASTS

*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
,
Robert
,
accompanied
by
Iola
,
went
to
the
settlement
to
*NL*
take
supper
with
Aunt
Linda
,
and
a
very
luscious
affair
it
was
.
Her
*NL*
fingers
had
not
lost
their
skill
since
she
had
tasted
the
sweets
of
*NL*
freedom
.
Her
biscuits
were
just
as
light
and
flaky
as
ever
.
Her
jelly
*NL*
was
as
bright
as
amber
,
and
her
preserves
were
perfectly
delicious
.
*NL*
After
she
had
set
the
table
she
stood
looking
in
silent
admiration
,
*NL*
chuckling
to
herself
:
``
Ole
Mistus
ca
n't
set
sich
a
table
as

She
*NL*

freedom

mighty

*NL*
*NL*
Aunt
Linda
had
invited
Uncle
Daniel
,
and
,
wishing
to
give
him
a
pleasant
*NL*
surprise
,
she
had
refrained
from
telling
him
that
Robert
Johnson
was
the
*NL*
one
she
wished
him
to
meet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do

said
Aunt
Linda
to
Uncle
Daniel
,
when
the
*NL*

arrived

*NL*
*NL*
``

Uncle

looked
puzzled
and
,
slowly
scanning
Robert

features
,
*NL*
said
:

*NL*

There

something

motherly

reminiscences

recollections

interested

After
the
supper
,
Salters
and
his
guests
returned
to
the
front
room
,
*NL*
which
Aunt
Linda
regarded
with
so
much
pride
,
and
on
which
she
bestowed
*NL*
so
much
care
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

Captin

said
Salters
,
``
I

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

replied
Robert
,
``
it
was
only
a
flesh
wound

this

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

Salters

''
continued
Robert
,
``
our
freedom
was
a
costly
thing
.
Did
*NL*
you
know
that
Captain
Sybil
was
killed
in
one
of

last
battles
of
the
*NL*
war

These

who
are
taking
it
so
easy
,
do
n't
know
the
*NL*
hardships
through
which
we
older
ones
passed
.
But
all
the
battles
are
*NL*
not
fought
,
nor
all
the
victories
won
.
The
colored
man
has
escaped
from
*NL*
one
slavery
,
and
I
do
n't
want
him
to
fall
into
another
.
I
want
the
young
*NL*
folks
to
keep
their
brains
clear
,
and
their
right
arms
strong
,
to
fight
*NL*
the
battles
of
life
manfully
,
and
take
their
places
alongside

The
homely

her
after

Further

appearance

drawn

two

CHAPTER

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
REVELATION
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
lovely
evening
for
the
journey
.
The
air
was
soft
and
balmy
.
The
*NL*
fields
and
hedges
were
redolent
with
flowers
.
Not
a
single
cloud
*NL*
obscured
the
brightness
of
the
moon
or
the
splendor
of
the
stars
.
The
*NL*
ancient
trees
were
festooned
with
moss
,
which
hung
like
graceful
*NL*
draperies
.
Ever
and
anon
a
startled
hare
glided
over
the
path
,
and
*NL*
whip-poor-wills
and
crickets
broke
the
restful
silence
of
the
night
.
*NL*
Robert
rode
quietly
along
,
quaffing
the
beauty
of
the
scene
and
thinking
*NL*
of
his
boyish
days
,
when
he
gathered
nuts
and
wild
plums
in
those
woods
;
*NL*
he
also
indulged
pleasant
reminiscences
of
later
years
,
when
,
with
Uncle
*NL*
Daniel
and
Tom
Anderson
,
he
attended
the
secret
prayer-meetings
.
Iola
*NL*
rode
along
,
conversing
with
Aunt
Linda
,
amused
and
interested
at
the
*NL*
quaintness
of
her
speech
and
the
shrewdness
of
her
intellect
.
To
her
the
*NL*
ride
was
delightful
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
yer
know
dis
place
,
Robby
,
''
asked
Aunt
Linda
,
as
they
passed
an
*NL*
old
resort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
I
did
,
''
replied
Robert
.
``
It
is
the
place
where
we
held
*NL*
our
last
prayer-meeting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``

Thus
discoursing
they
had
beguiled
the
long
hours
of
the
night
and
made
*NL*
their
long
journey
appear
short
.
*NL*
*NL*
Very
soon
they
reached
the
church
,
a
neat
,
commodious
,
frame
building
,
*NL*
with
a
blue
ceiling
,
white
walls
within
and
without
,
and
large
windows
*NL*
with
mahogany-colored
facings
.
It
was
a
sight
full
of
pathetic
interest
*NL*
to
see
that
group
which
gathered
from
miles
around
.
They
had
come
to
*NL*
break
bread
with
each
other
,
relate
their
experiences
,
and
tell
of
their
*NL*
hopes
of
heaven
.
In
that
meeting
were
remnants
of
broken
*NL*
families
--
mothers
who
had
been
separated
from
their
children
before
the
*NL*
war
,
husbands
who
had
not
met
their
wives
for
years
.
After
the
bread
had
*NL*
been
distributed
and
the
handshaking
was
nearly
over
,
Robert
raised
the
*NL*
hymn
which
Iola
had
sung
for
him
when
he
was
recovering
from
his
wounds
,
*NL*
and
Iola
,
with
her
clear
,
sweet
tones
,
caught
up
the
words
and
joined
*NL*
him
in
the
strain
.
When
the
hymn
was
finished
a
dear
old
mother
rose
*NL*
from
her
seat
.
Her
voice
was
quite
strong
.
With
still
a
lingering
light
*NL*
and
fire
in
her
eye
,
she
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
rise
,
bredren
an
'
sisters
,
to
say
I
'm
on
my
solemn
march

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Amen
!
''
``
Glory

''
came
from
a
number
of
voices
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
`

*NL*
*NL*
``
Dat

exclaimed
a
chorus
of
voices
.
Some
of
her
hearers
moaned
,
*NL*
others
rocked
to
and
fro
,
as
thoughts
of
similar
scenes
in
their
own
*NL*
lives
arose
before
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
my

continued
the
speaker

''
*NL*
*NL*
Having
finished
her
speech
,
she
sat
down
and
wiped
away
the
tears
that
*NL*
flowed
all
the
more
copiously
as
she
remembered
her
lost
children
.
When
*NL*
she
rose
to
speak
her
voice
and
manner
instantly
arrested
Robert
's
*NL*
attention
.
He
found
his
mind
reverting
to
the
scenes
of
his
childhood
.
*NL*
As
she
proceeded
his
attention
became
riveted
on
her
.
Unbidden
tears
*NL*
filled
his
eyes
and
great
sobs
shook
his
frame
.
He
trembled
in
every
*NL*
limb
.
Could
it
be
possible
that
after
years
of
patient
search
through
*NL*
churches
,
papers
,
and
inquiring
friends
,
he
had
accidentally
stumbled
on
*NL*
his
mother
--
the
mother
who
,
long
years
ago
,
had
pillowed
his
head
upon
*NL*
her
bosom
and
left
her
parting
kiss
upon
his
lips
?
How
should
he
reveal
*NL*
himself
to
her
?
Might
not
sudden
joy
do
what
years
of
sorrow
had
failed
*NL*
to
accomplish
?
Controlling
his
feelings
as
best
he
could
,
he
rose
to
*NL*
tell
his
experience
.
He
referred
to
the
days
when
they
used
to
hold
*NL*
their
meetings
in
the
lonely
woods
and
gloomy
swamps
.
How
they
had
*NL*
prayed
for
freedom
and
plotted
to
desert
to
the
Union
army
;
and
*NL*
continuing
,
he
said
:
``
Since
then
,
brethren
and
sisters
,
I
have
had
my
*NL*
crosses
and
trials
,
but
I
try
to
look
at
the
mercies
.
Just
think
what
it
*NL*
was
then
and
what
it
is
now
!
How
many
of
us
,
since
freedom
has
come
,
*NL*
have
been
looking
up
our
scattered
relatives
.
I
have
just
been
over
to
*NL*
visit
my
old
mistress
,
Nancy
Johnson
,
and
to
see
if
I
could
get
some
*NL*
clue
to
my
long-lost
mother
,
who
was
sold
from
me
nearly
thirty
years
*NL*
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
there
was
a
chorus
of
moans
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
resuming
,
Robert
's
voice
was
still
fuller
of
pathos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
heard
that
dear
old
mother
tell
her
experience
it
*NL*
seemed
as
if
some
one
had
risen
from
the
dead
.
She
made
me
think
of
my
*NL*
own
dear
mother
,
who
used
to
steal
out
at
night
to
see
me
,
fold
me
in
*NL*
her
arms
,
and
then
steal
back
again
to
her
work
.
After
she
was
sold
*NL*
away
I
never
saw
her
face
again
by
daylight
.
I
have
been
looking
for
her
*NL*
ever
since
the
war
,
and
I
think
at
last
I
have
got
on
the
right
track
.
*NL*
If
Mrs.
Johnson
,
who
kept
the
boarding-house
in
C
--
,
is
the
one
who
*NL*
sold
that
dear
old
mother
from
her
son
,
then
she
is
the
one
I
am
looking
*NL*
for
,
and
I
am
the
son
she
has
been
praying
for
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
dear
old
mother
raised
her
eyes
.
They
were
clear
and
tearless
.
An
*NL*
expression
of
wonder
,
hope
,
and
love
flitted
over
her
face
.
It
seemed
as
*NL*
if
her
youth
were
suddenly
renewed
and
,
bounding
from
her
seat
,
she
*NL*
rushed
to
the
speaker
in
a
paroxysm
of
joy
.
``
Oh
,
Robby
!
Robby
!
is
dis
*NL*
you
?
Is
dat
my
pore
,
dear
boy
I
`
se
been
prayin
'
`
bout
all
dese
years
?
*NL*
Oh
,
glory
!
glory
!
''
And
overflowing
with
joyous
excitement
she
threw
her
*NL*
arms
around
him
,
looking
the
very
impersonation
of
rapturous
content
.
It
*NL*
was
a
happy
time
.
Mothers
whose
children
had
been
torn
from
them
in
the
*NL*
days
of
slavery
knew
how
to
rejoice
in
her
joy
.
The
young
people
caught
*NL*
the
infection
of
the
general
happiness
and
rejoiced
with
them
that
*NL*
rejoiced
.
There
were
songs
of
rejoicing
and
shouts
of
praise
.
The
*NL*
undertone
of
sadness
which
had
so
often
mingled
with
their
songs
gave
*NL*
place
to
strains
of
exultation
;
and
tears
of
tender
sympathy
flowed
from
*NL*
eyes
which
had
often
been
blurred
by
anguish
.
The
child
of
many
prayers
*NL*
and
tears
was
restored
to
his
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
Iola
stood
by
the
mother
's
side
,
smiling
,
and
weeping
tears
of
joy
.
When
*NL*
Robert
's
mother
observed
Iola
,
she
said
to
Robert
,
``
Is
dis
yore
wife
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
''
replied
Robert
,
``
but
I
believe
she
is
your
grandchild
,
the
*NL*
daughter
of
the
little

sold

so
long
ago

She
*NL*
is
on
her
way
to
the
farther
South
in

of
her

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
``
My

Robert

``
now

Ever
since
the

I
have
been
*NL*
trying
to
find
out

you

but
all

failed

At

I

I

*NL*
*NL*
Tenderly
and
caressingly
Iola
bent
over
the
happy
mother
,
with
her
heart
*NL*
filled
with
mournful
memories
of
her
own
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aunt
Linda
was
induced
to
stay
until
the
next
morning
,
and
then
gladly
*NL*
assisted
Robert
's
mother
in
arranging
for
her
journey
northward
.
The
*NL*
friends
who
had
given
her
a
shelter
in
their
hospitable
home
,
learned
to
*NL*
value
her
so
much
that
it
was
with
great
reluctance
they
resigned
her
to
*NL*
the
care
of
her
son
.
Aunt
Linda
was
full
of
bustling
activity
,
and
her
*NL*
spirits
overflowed
with
good
humor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now

said

*NL*
A
bright
smile
overspread
her
face
.
Robert
's
words
reassured
and
*NL*
gladdened
her
heart
.
She
was
well
satisfied
to
have
a
pleasant
aftermath
*NL*
from
life
on
this
side
of
the
river

*NL*
*NL*
After
arriving
home
Linda

first
thought
was
to
prepare
dinner
for
her
*NL*
guests
.
But
,
before
she
began
her
work
of
preparation
,
she
went
to
the
*NL*
cupboard
to
get
a
cup
of
home-made
wine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here

she
said

filling
three
glasses

down

said
Robert
,
*NL*
encouragingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Very
soon
Aunt
Linda
had
an
excellent
dinner
prepared
.
After
it
was
over
*NL*
Robert
went
with
Iola
to
C
--
,
where
her
friend
,
the
bishop
,
was
*NL*
awaiting
her
return
.
She
told
him
the
wonderful
story
of
Robert
's
*NL*
finding
his
mother
,
and
of
her
sweet
,
childlike
faith
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bishop
,
a
kind
,
fatherly
man
,
said
,
``
Miss
Iola
,
I
hope
that
such
*NL*
happiness
is
in
store
for
you
.
My
dear
child
,
still
continue
to
pray
and
*NL*
trust
.
I
am
old-fashioned
enough
to
believe
in
prayer
.
I
knew
an
old
*NL*
lady
living
in
Illinois
,
who
was
a
slave
.
Her
son
got
a
chance
to
come
*NL*
North
and
beg
money
to
buy
his
mother
.
The
mother
was
badly
treated
,
and
*NL*
made
up
her
mind
to
run
away
.
But
before
she
started
she
thought
she
*NL*
would
kneel
down
to
pray
.
And
something
,
she
said
,
reasoned
within
her
,
*NL*
and
whispered
,
`
Stand
still
and
see
what
I
am
going
to
do
for
you
.
'
So
*NL*
real
was
it
to
her
that
she
unpacked
her
bundle
and
desisted
from
her
*NL*
flight
.
Strange
as
it
may
appear
to
you
,
her
son
returned
,
bringing
*NL*
with
him
money
enough
to
purchase
her
freedom
,
and
she
was
redeemed
from
*NL*
bondage
.
Had
she
persisted
in
running
away
she
might
have
been
lost
in
*NL*
the
woods
and
have
died
,
exhausted
by
starvation
.
But
she
believed
,
she
*NL*
trusted
,
and
was
delivered
.
Her
son
took
her
North
,
where
she
could
find
*NL*
a
resting
place
for
the
soles
of
her
feet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
night
Iola
and
the
bishop
left
for
the
South

After
Iola
had
left
the
settlement
,
accompanied
by
Robert
as
far
as
the
*NL*
town
,
it
was
a
pleasant
satisfaction
for
the
two
old
friends
to
settle
*NL*
themselves
down
,
and
talk
of
times
past
,
departed
friends
,
and
*NL*
long-forgotten
scenes

*NL*
*NL*
They
chatted
together
until
Job
and
Salters
came
home
for
supper
.
After
*NL*
they
had
eaten
,
Uncle
Daniel
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
hab
a
word

''
*NL*
*NL*
There
,
in
that
peaceful
habitation
,
they
knelt
down
,
and
mingled
their
*NL*
prayers
together
,
as
they
had
done
in
by-gone
days
,
when
they
had
met
by
*NL*
stealth
in
lonely
swamps
or
silent
forests
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
Robert
and
his
mother
started
northward
.
They
were
well
*NL*
supplied
with
a
bountiful
luncheon
by
Aunt
Linda
,
who
had
so
thoroughly
*NL*
enjoyed
their
sojourn
with
her
.
On
the
next
day
he
arrived
in
the
city
*NL*
of
P
--
,
and
took
his
mother
to
his
boarding-house
,
until
he
could
find
*NL*
a
suitable
home
into
which
to
install
her
.
He
soon
came
across
one
which
*NL*
just
suited
his
taste
,
but
when
the
agent
discovered
that
Robert
's
*NL*
mother
was
colored
,
he
told
him
that
the
house
had
been
previously
*NL*
engaged
.
In
company
with
his
mother
he
looked
at
several
other
houses
in
*NL*
desirable
neighborhoods
,
but
they
were
constantly
met
with
the
answer
,
*NL*
``
The
house
is
engaged
,
''
or
,
``
We
do
not
rent

''
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
Robert
went
alone
,
and
,
finding
a
desirable
house
,
engaged
it
,
*NL*
and
moved
into
it
.
In
a
short
time
it
was
discovered
that
he
was
*NL*
colored
,
and
,
at
the
behest
of
the
local
sentiment
of
the
place
,
the
*NL*
landlord
used
his
utmost
endeavors
to
oust
him
,
simply
because
he
*NL*
belonged
to
an
unfashionable
and
unpopular
race
.
At
last
he
came
across
*NL*
a
landlord
who
was
broad
enough
to
rent
him
a
good
house
,
and
he
found
a
*NL*
quiet
resting
place
among
a
set
of
well-to-do
and
well-disposed
people

CHAPTER

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
FURTHER
LIFTING
OF
THE
VEIL
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
one
of
those
fearful
conflicts
by
which
the
Mississippi
was
freed
*NL*
from
Rebel
intrusion
and
opened
to
commerce
Harry
was
severely
wounded
,
*NL*
and
forced
to
leave
his
place
in
the
ranks
for
a
bed
in
the
hospital
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
as
he
lay
in
his
bed
,
thinking
of
his
former
home
in
*NL*
Mississippi
and
wondering
if
the
chances
of
war
would
ever
restore
him
*NL*
to
his
loved
ones
,
he
fell
into
a
quiet
slumber
.
When
he
awoke
he
found
*NL*
a
lady
bending
over
him
,
holding
in
her
hands
some
fruit
and
flowers
.
As
*NL*
she
tenderly
bent
over
Harry
's
bed
their
eyes
met
,
and
with
a
thrill
of
*NL*
gladness
they
recognized
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
son
,
my
son
!
''
cried
Marie
,
trying
to
repress
her
emotion
,
as
she
*NL*
took
his
wasted
hand
in
hers
,
and
kissed
the
pale
cheeks
that
sickness
*NL*
and
suffering
had
blanched
.
Harry
was
very
weak
,
but
her
presence
was
a
*NL*
call
to
life
.
He
returned
the
pressure
of
her
hand
,
kissed
it
,
and
his
*NL*
eyes
grew
full
of
sudden
light
,
as
he
murmured
faintly
,
but
joyfully
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma
;
oh
,
mamma
!
have
I
found
you
at
last
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
effort
was
too
much
,
and
he
immediately
became
unconscious
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anxious
,
yet
hopeful
,
Marie
sat
by
the
bedside
of
her
son
till
*NL*
consciousness
was
restored
.
Caressingly
she
bent
over
his
couch
,
*NL*
murmuring
in
her
happiness
the
tenderest
,
sweetest
words
of
motherly
*NL*
love
.
In
Harry
's
veins
flowed
new
life
and
vigor
,
calming
the
*NL*
restlessness
of
his
nerves
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
possible
Harry
was
carried
to
his
mother
's
home
;
a
home
*NL*
brought
into
the
light
of
freedom
by
the
victories
of
General
Grant
.
*NL*
Nursed
by
his
mother
's
tender
,
loving
care
,
he
rapidly
recovered
,
but
,
*NL*
being
too
disabled
to
re-enter
the
army
,
he
was
honorably
discharged
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lorraine
had
taken
Marie
to
Vicksburg
,
and
there
allowed
her
to
engage
*NL*
in
confectionery
and
preserving
for
the
wealthy
ladies
of
the
city
.
He
*NL*
had
at
first
attempted
to
refugee
with
her
in
Texas
,
but
,
being
foiled
*NL*
in
the
attempt
,
he
was
compelled
to
enlist
in
the
Confederate
Army
,
and
*NL*
met
his
fate
by
being
killed
just
before
the
surrender
of
Vicksburg
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
son
,
''
Marie
would
say
,
as
she
bent
fondly
over
him
,
``
I
am
*NL*
deeply
sorry
that
you
are
wounded
,
but
I
am
glad
that
the
fortunes
of
*NL*
war
have
brought
us
together
.
Poor
Iola
!
I
_
do
_
wonder
what
has
become
*NL*
of
her
?
Just
as
soon
as
this
war
is
over
I
want
you
to
search
the
*NL*
country
all
over
.
Poor
child
!
How
my
heart
has
ached
for
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Time
passed
on
.
Harry
and
his
mother
searched
and
inquired
for
Iola
,
but
*NL*
no
tidings
of
her
reached
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
fully
recovered
his
health
,
and
seeing
the
great
need
of
*NL*
education
for
the
colored
people
,
Harry
turned
his
attention
toward
*NL*
them
,
and
joined
the
new
army
of
Northern
teachers
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
still
continued
his
inquiries
for
his
sister
,
not
knowing
whether
or
*NL*
not
she
had
succumbed
to
the
cruel
change
in
her
life
.
He
thought
she
*NL*
might
have
passed
into
the
white
basis
for
the
sake
of
bettering
her
*NL*
fortunes
.
Hope
deferred
,
which
had
sickened
his
mother
's
heart
,
had
*NL*
only
roused
him
to
renewed
diligence
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
school
was
offered
him
in
Georgia
,
and
thither
he
repaired
,
taking
his
*NL*
mother
with
him
.
They
were
soon
established
in
the
city
of
A
--
.
In
*NL*
hope
of
finding
Iola
he
visited
all
the
conferences
of
the
Methodist
*NL*
Church
,
but
for
a
long
time
his
search
was
in
vain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma
,
''
said
Harry
,
one
day
during
his
vacation
,
``
there
is
to
be
a
*NL*
Methodist
Conference
in
this
State
in
the
city
of
S
--
,
about
one
*NL*
hundred
and
fifty
miles
from
here
.
I
intend
to
go
and
renew
my
search
*NL*
for
Iola
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
child
!
''
burst
out
Marie
,
as
the
tears
gathered
in
her
eyes
,
``
I
*NL*
wonder
if
she
is
living
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
so
,
''
said
Harry
,
kissing
the
pale
cheek
of
his
mother
;
``
I
do
n't
*NL*
feel
that
Iola
is
dead
.
I
believe
we
will
find
her
before
long
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
to
me
my
heart
would
burst
with
joy
to
see
my
dear
child
just
*NL*
once
more
.
I
am
glad
that
you
are
going
.
When
will
you
leave
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To-morrow
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
son
,
go
,
and
my
prayers
will
go
with
you
,
''
was
Marie
's
tender
*NL*
parting
wish
.
*NL*
*NL*
Early
next
morning
Harry
started
for
the
conference
,
and
reached
the
*NL*
church
before
the
morning
session
was
over
.
Near
him
sat
two
ladies
,
one
*NL*
fair
,
the
other
considerably
darker
.
There
was
something
in
the
fairer
*NL*
one
that
reminded
him
forcibly
of
his
sister
,
but
she
was
much
older
and
*NL*
graver
than
he
imagined
his
sister
to
be
.
Instantly
he
dismissed
the
*NL*
thought
that
had
forced
itself
into
his
mind
,
and
began
to
listen
*NL*
attentively
to
the
proceedings
of
the
conference
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
regular
business
of
the
morning
session
was
over
the
bishop
*NL*
arose
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
an
interesting
duty
to
perform
.
I
wish
to
introduce
a
young
lady
*NL*
to
the
conference
,
who
was
the
daughter
of
a
Mississippi
planter
.
She
is
*NL*
now
in
search
of
her
mother
and
brother
,
from
whom
she
was
sold
a
few
*NL*
months
before
the
war
.
Her
father
married
her
mother
in
Ohio
,
where
he
*NL*
had
taken
her
to
be
educated
.
After
his
death
they
were
robbed
of
their
*NL*
inheritance
and
enslaved
by
a
distant
relative
named
Lorraine
.
Miss
Iola
*NL*
Leroy
is
the
young
lady
's
name
.
If
any
one
can
give
the
least
*NL*
information
respecting
the
objects
of
her
search
it
will
be
thankfully
*NL*
received
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
,
''
exclaimed
a
young
man
,
rising
in
the
midst
of
the
audience
,
and
*NL*
pressing
eagerly
,
almost
impetuously
,
forward
.
``
I
am
her
brother
,
and
I
*NL*
came
here
to
look
for
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Iola
raised
her
eyes
to
his
face
,
so
flushed
and
bright
with
the
glow
of
*NL*
recognition
,
rushed
to
him
,
threw
her
arms
around
his
neck
,
kissed
him
*NL*
again
and
again
,
crying
:
``
O
,
Harry
!
''
Then
she
fainted
from
excitement
.
*NL*
The
women
gathered
around
her
with
expressions
of
tender
sympathy
,
and
*NL*
gave
her
all
the
care
she
needed
.
They
called
her
the
``
dear
child
,
''
for
*NL*
without
any
effort
on
her
part
she
had
slidden
into
their
hearts
and
*NL*
found
a
ready
welcome
in
each
sympathizing
bosom
.
*NL*
*NL*
Harry
at
once
telegraphed
the
glad
tidings
to
his
mother
,
who
waited
*NL*
their
coming
with
joyful
anticipation
.
Long
before
the
cars
reached
the
*NL*
city
,
Mrs.
Leroy
was
at
the
depot
,
restlessly
walking
the
platform
or
*NL*
eagerly
peering
into
the
darkness
to
catch
the
first
glimpse
of
the
*NL*
train
which
was
bearing
her
treasures
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
the
cars
arrived
,
and
,
as
Harry
and
Iola
alighted
,
Marie
*NL*
rushed
forward
,
clasped
Iola
in
her
arms
and
sobbed
out
her
joy
in
*NL*
broken
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
Very
happy
was
the
little
family
that
sat
together
around
the
*NL*
supper-table
for
the
first
time
for
years
.
They
partook
of
that
supper
*NL*
with
thankful
hearts
and
with
eyes
overflowing
with
tears
of
joy
.
Very
*NL*
touching
were
the
prayers
the
mother
uttered
,
when
she
knelt
with
her
*NL*
children
that
night
to
return
thanks
for
their
happy
reunion
,
and
to
*NL*
seek
protection
through
the
slumbers
of
the
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
,
as
they
sat
at
the
breakfast-table
,
Marie
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
child
,
you
are
so
changed
I
do
not
think
I
would
have
known
you
*NL*
if
I
had
met
you
in
the
street
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
,
''
said
Harry
,
``
can
hardly
realize
that
you
are
our
own
Iola
,
whom
*NL*
I
recognized
as
sister
a
half
dozen
years
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Am
I
so
changed
?
''
asked
Iola
,
as
a
faint
sigh
escaped
her
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Iola
,
''
said
Harry
,
``
you
used
to
be
the
most
harum-scarum
girl
I
*NL*
ever
knew
,
laughing
,
dancing
,
and
singing
from
morning
until
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
remember
,
''
said
Iola
.
``
It
all
comes
back
to
me
like
a
dream
.
Oh
,
*NL*
mamma
!
I
have
passed
through
a
fiery
ordeal
of
suffering
since
then
.
But
*NL*
it
is
useless
,
''
and
as
she
continued
her
face
assumed
a
brighter
look
,
*NL*
``
to
brood
over
the
past
.
Let
us
be
happy
in
the
present
.
Let
me
tell
you
*NL*
something
which
will
please
you
.
Do
you
remember
telling
me
about
your
*NL*
mother
and
brother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Marie
,
in
a
questioning
tone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
continued
Iola
,
with
eyes
full
of
gladness
,
``
I
think
I
have
*NL*
found
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
it
be
possible
!
''
exclaimed
Marie
,
in
astonishment
.
``
It
is
more
than
*NL*
thirty
years
since
we
parted
.
I
fear
you
are
mistaken
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
mamma
;
I
have
drawn
my
conclusions
from
good
circumstantial
*NL*
evidence
.
After
I
was
taken
from
you
,
I
passed
through
a
fearful
siege
*NL*
of
suffering
,
which
would
only
harrow
up
your
soul
to
hear
.
I
often
*NL*
shudder
at
the
remembrance
.
The
last
man
in
whose
clutches
I
found
*NL*
myself
was
mean
,
brutal
,
and
cruel
.
I
was
in
his
power
when
the
Union
*NL*
army
came
into
C
--
,
where
I
was
living
.
A
number
of
colored
men
*NL*
stampeded
to
the
Union
ranks
,
with
a
gentleman
as
a
leader
,
whom
I
think
*NL*
is
your
brother
.
A
friend
of
his
reported
my
case
to
the
commander
of
*NL*
the
post
,
who
instantly
gave
orders
for
my
release
.
A
place
was
given
me
*NL*
as
nurse
in
the
hospital
.
I
attended
that
friend
in
his
last
illness
.
*NL*
Poor
fellow
!
he
was
the
best
friend
I
had
in
all
the
time
I
have
been
*NL*
tossing
about
.
The
gentleman
whom
I
think
is
your
brother
appeared
to
be
*NL*
very
anxious
about
his
friend
's
recovery
,
and
was
deeply
affected
by
his
*NL*
death
.
In
one
of
the
last
terrible
battles
of
the
war
,
that
of
Five
*NL*
Forks
,
he
was
wounded
and
put
into
the
hospital
ward
where
I
was
an
*NL*
attendant
.
For
awhile
he
was
delirious
,
and
in
his
delirium
he
would
*NL*
sometimes
think
that
I
was
his
mother
and
at
other
times
his
sister
.
I
*NL*
humored
his
fancies
,
would
often
sing
to
him
when
he
was
restless
,
and
*NL*
my
voice
almost
invariably
soothed
him
to
sleep
.
One
day
I
sang
to
him
*NL*
that
old
hymn
we
used
to
sing
on
the
plantation
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Drooping
souls
no
longer
grieve
,
*NL*
Heaven
is
propitious
;
*NL*
If
on
Christ
you
do
believe
,
*NL*
You
will
find
Him
precious
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
remember
,
''
said
Marie
,
with
a
sigh
,
as
memories
of
the
past
swept
*NL*
over
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
I
had
finished
the
hymn
,
''
continued
Iola
,
``
he
looked
earnestly
*NL*
and
inquiringly
into
my
face
,
and
asked
,
`
Where
did
you
learn
that
hymn
?
*NL*
I
have
heard
my
mother
sing
it
when
I
was
a
boy
,
but
I
have
never
heard
*NL*
it
since
.
'
I
think
,
mamma
,
the
words
,
'
I
was
lost
but
now
I
'm
found
;
*NL*
glory
!
glory
!
glory
!
'
had
imprinted
themselves
on
his
memory
,
and
that
*NL*
his
mind
was
assuming
a
higher
state
of
intellectuality
.
He
asked
me
to
*NL*
sing
it
again
,
which
I
did
,
until
he
fell
asleep
.
Then
I
noticed
a
*NL*
marked
resemblance
between
him
and
Harry
,
and
I
thought
,
`
Suppose
he
*NL*
should
prove
to
be
your
long-lost
brother
?
'
During
his
convalescence
we
*NL*
found
that
we
had
a
common
ground
of
sympathy
.
We
were
anxious
to
be
*NL*
reunited
to
our
severed
relations
.
We
had
both
been
separated
from
our
*NL*
mothers
.
He
told
me
of
his
little
sister
,
with
whom
he
used
to
play
.
She
*NL*
had
a
mole
on
her
cheek
which
he
called
her
beauty
spot
.
He
had
the
red
*NL*
spot
on
his
forehead
which
you
told
me
of
.

CHAPTER

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
DELIGHTFUL
REUNIONS
.
*NL*
*NL*
Very
bright
and
happy
was
the
home
where
Marie
and
her
children
were
*NL*
gathered
under
one
roof
.
Mrs.
Leroy
's
neighbors
said
she
looked
ten
*NL*
years
younger
.
Into
that
peaceful
home
came
no
fearful
forebodings
of
*NL*
cruel
separations
.
Harry
and
Iola
were
passionately
devoted
to
their
*NL*
mother
,
and
did
all
they
could
to
flood
her
life
with
sunshine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Iola
,
dear
,
''
said
Harry
,
one
morning
at
the
breakfast-table
,
``
I
have
a
*NL*
new
pleasure
in
store
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
,
brother
mine
?
''
asked
Iola
,
assuming
an
air
of
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
a
young
lady
living
in
this
city
to
whom
I
wish
to
introduce
*NL*
you
.
She
is
one
of
the
most
remarkable
women
I
have
ever
met
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
tell
me
all
about
her
,
''
said
Iola
.
``
Is
she
young
and
handsome
,
*NL*
brilliant
and
witty
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
,
''
replied
Harry
,
``
is
more
than
handsome
,
she
is
lovely
;
more
than
*NL*
witty
,
she
is
wise
;
more
than
brilliant
,
she
is
excellent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Harry
,
''
said
Mrs.
Leroy
,
smiling
,
``
if
you
keep
on
that
way
I
*NL*
shall
begin
to
fear
that
I
shall
soon
be
supplanted
by
a
new
daughter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
mamma
,
''
replied
Harry
,
looking
slightly
confused
,
``
I
did
not
*NL*
mean
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Harry
,
''
said
Iola
,
amused
,
``
go
on
with
your
description
;
I
am
*NL*
becoming
interested
.
Tax
your
powers
of
description
to
give
me
her
*NL*
likeness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
in
the
first
place
,
''
continued
Harry
,
``
I
suppose
she
is
about
*NL*
twenty-five
years
old
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
the
idea
,
''
interrupted
Iola
,
``
of
a
gentleman
talking
of
a
lady
's
*NL*
age
.
That
is
a
tabooed
subject
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Iola
,
that
adds
to
the
interest
of
my
picture
.
It
is
her
*NL*
combination
of
earnestness
and
youthfulness
which
enhances
her
in
my
*NL*
estimation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
the
interruption
,
''
said
Iola
;
``
I
am
anxious
to
hear
more
about
*NL*
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
she
is
of
medium
height
,
somewhat
slender
,
and
well
formed
,
with
*NL*
dark
,
expressive
eyes
,
full
of
thought
and
feeling
.
Neither
hair
nor
*NL*
complexion
show
the
least
hint
of
blood
admixture
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
of
it
,
''
said
Iola
.
``
Every
person
of
unmixed
blood
who
*NL*
succeeds
in
any
department
of
literature
,
art
,
or
science
is
a
living
*NL*
argument
for
the
capability
which
is
in
the
race
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
responded
Harry
,
``
for
it
is
not
the
white
blood
which
is
on
trial
*NL*
before
the
world
.
Well
,
I
will
bring
her
around
this
evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
Harry
brought
Miss
Delany
to
call
on
his
sister
and
*NL*
mother
.
They
were
much
pleased
with
their
visitor
.
Her
manner
was
a
*NL*
combination
of
suavity
and
dignity
.
During
the
course
of
the
evening
*NL*
they
learned
that
she
was
a
graduate
of
the
University
of
A
--
.
One
day
*NL*
she
saw
in
the
newspapers
that
colored
women
were
becoming
unfit
to
be
*NL*
servants
for
white
people
.
She
then
thought
that
if
they
are
not
fit
to
*NL*
be
servants
for
white
people
,
they
are
unfit
to
be
mothers
to
their
own
*NL*
children
,
and
she
conceived
the
idea
of
opening
a
school
to
train
future
*NL*
wives
and
mothers
.
She
began
on
a
small
scale
,
in
a
humble
building
,
*NL*
and
her
work
was
soon
crowned
with
gratifying
success
.
She
had
enlarged
*NL*
her
quarters
,
increased
her
teaching
force
,
and
had
erected
a
large
and
*NL*
commodious
school-house
through
her
own
exertions
and
the
help
of
*NL*
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marie
cordially
invited
her
to
call
again
,
saying
,
as
she
rose
to
go
:
``
I
*NL*
am
very
glad
to
have
met
you
.
Young
women
like
you
always
fill
my
heart
*NL*
with
hope
for
the
future
of
our
race
.
In
you
I
see
reflected
some
of
the
*NL*
blessed
possibilities
which
lie
within
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
''
said
Miss
Delany
,
``
I
want
to
be
classed
among
those
of
whom
*NL*
it
is
said
,
`
She
has
done
what
she
could
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Very
pleasant
was
the
acquaintance
which
sprang
up
between
Miss
Delany
*NL*
and
Iola
.
Although
she
was
older
than
Iola
,
their
tastes
were
so
*NL*
congenial
,
their
views
of
life
and
duty
in
such
unison
,
that
their
*NL*
acquaintance
soon
ripened
into
strong
and
lasting
friendship
.
There
were
*NL*
no
foolish
rivalries
and
jealousies
between
them
.
Their
lives
were
too
*NL*
full
of
zeal
and
earnestness
for
them
to
waste
in
selfishness
their
*NL*
power
to
be
moral
and
spiritual
forces
among
a
people
who
so
much
needed
*NL*
their
helping
hands
.
Miss
Delany
gave
Iola
a
situation
in
her
school
;
*NL*
but
before
the
term
was
quite
over
she
was
force
to
resign
,
her
health
*NL*
having
been
so
undermined
by
the
fearful
strain
through
which
she
had
*NL*
passed
,
that
she
was
quite
unequal
to
the
task
.
She
remained
at
home
,
*NL*
and
did
what
her
strength
would
allow
in
assisting
her
mother
in
the
*NL*
work
of
canning
and
preserving
fruits
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
Iola
had
been
corresponding
with
Robert
.
She
had
told
*NL*
him
of
her
success
in
finding
her
mother
and
brother
,
and
had
received
*NL*
an
answer
congratulating
her
on
the
glad
fruition
of
her
hopes
.
He
also
*NL*
said
that
his
business
was
flourishing
,
that
his
mother
was
keeping
*NL*
house
for
him
,
and
,
to
use
her
own
expression
,
was
as
happy
as
the
days
*NL*
are
long
.
She
was
firmly
persuaded
that
Marie
was
her
daughter
,
and
she
*NL*
wanted
to
see
her
before
she
died
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
one
thing
,
''
continued
the
letter
,
``
that
your
mother
may
*NL*
remember
her
by
.
It
was
a
little
handkerchief
on
which
were
a
number
of
*NL*
cats
'
heads
.
She
gave
one
to
each
of
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
remember
it
well
,
''
said
Marie
,
``
she
must
,
indeed
,
be
my
mother
.
Now
,
*NL*
all
that
is
needed
to
complete
my
happiness
is
her
presence
,
and
my
*NL*
brother
's
.
And
I
intend
,
if
I
live
long
enough
,
to
see
them
both
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Iola
wrote
Robert
that
her
mother
remembered
the
incident
of
the
*NL*
handkerchief
,
and
was
anxious
to
see
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
early
fall
Robert
started
for
the
South
in
order
to
clear
up
all
*NL*
doubts
with
respect
to
their
relationship
.
He
found
Iola
,
Harry
,
and
*NL*
their
mother
living
cosily
together
.
Harry
was
teaching
and
was
a
leader
*NL*
among
the
rising
young
men
of
the
State
.
His
Northern
education
and
*NL*
later
experience
had
done
much
toward
adapting
him
to
the
work
of
the
*NL*
new
era
which
had
dawned
upon
the
South
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marie
was
very
glad
to
welcome
Robert
to
her
home
,
but
it
was
almost
*NL*
impossible
to
recognize
her
brother
in
that
tall
,
handsome
man
,
with
*NL*
dark-brown
eyes
and
wealth
of
chestnut-colored
hair
,
which
he
readily
*NL*
lifted
to
show
the
crimson
spot
which
lay
beneath
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
as
they
sat
together
,
and
recalled
the
long-forgotten
scenes
of
*NL*
their
childhood
,
they
concluded
that
they
were
brother
and
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marie
,
''
said
Robert
,
``
how
would
you
like
to
leave
the
South
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
to
go
North
,
but
I
hate
to
leave
Harry
.
He
's
a
splendid
*NL*
young
fellow
,
although
I
say
it
myself
.
He
is
so
fearless
and
outspoken
*NL*
that
I
am
constantly
anxious
about
him
,
especially
at
election
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Harry
then
entered
the
room
,
and
,
being
introduced
to
Robert
,
gave
him
a
*NL*
cordial
welcome
.
He
had
just
returned
from
school
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
were
talking
of
you
,
my
son
,
''
said
Marie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
were
you
saying
?
Nothing
of
the
absent
but
good
?
''
asked
Harry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
telling
your
uncle
,
who
wants
me
to
come
North
,
that
I
would
go
,
*NL*
but
I
am
afraid
that
you
will
get
into
trouble
and
be
murdered
,
as
many
*NL*
others
have
been
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
,
mother
,
I
shall
not
die
till
my
time
comes
.
And
if
I
die
*NL*
helping
the
poor
and
needy
,
I
shall
die
at
my
post
.
Could
a
man
choose
a
*NL*
better
place
to
die
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Were
you
aware
of
the
virulence
of
caste
prejudice
and
the
disabilities
*NL*
which
surround
the
colored
people
when
you
cast
your
lot
with
them
?
''
*NL*
asked
Robert
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
fully
,
''
replied
Harry
;
``
but
after
I
found
out
that
I
was
colored
,
I
*NL*
consulted
the
principal
of
the
school
,
where
I
was
studying
,
in
*NL*
reference
to
the
future
.
He
said
that
if
I
stayed
in
the
North
,
he
had
*NL*
friends
whom
he
believed
would
give
me
any
situation
I
could
fill
,
and
I
*NL*
could
simply
take
my
place
in
the
rank
of
workers
,
the
same
as
any
other
*NL*
man
.
Then
he
told
me
of
the
army
,
and
I
made
up
my
mind
to
enter
it
,
*NL*
actuated
by
a
desire
to
find
my
mother
and
sister
;
and
at
any
rate
I
*NL*
wanted
to
avenge
their
wrongs
.
I
do
not
feel
so
now
.
Since
I
have
seen
*NL*
the
fearful
ravages
of
war
,
I
have
learned
to
pity
and
forgive
.
The
*NL*
principal
said
he
thought
I
would
be
more
apt
to
find
my
family
if
I
*NL*
joined
a
colored
regiment
in
the
West
than
if
I
joined
one
of
the
Maine
*NL*
companies
.
I
confess
at
first
I
felt
a
shrinking
from
taking
the
step
,
*NL*
but
love
for
my
mother
overcame
all
repugnance
on
my
part
.
Now
that
I
*NL*
have
linked
my
fortunes
to
the
race
I
intend
to
do
all
I
can
for
its
*NL*
elevation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
spoke
Robert
gazed
admiringly
on
the
young
face
,
lit
up
by
noble
*NL*
purposes
and
lofty
enthusiasm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right
,
Harry
.
I
think
it
would
be
treason
,
not
only
to
the
*NL*
race
,
but
to
humanity
,
to
have
you
ignoring
your
kindred
and
*NL*
masquerading
as
a
white
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
so
,
too
,
''
said
Marie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
sister
,
I
am
anxious
for
you
all
to
come
North
.
If
Harry
feels
*NL*
that
the
place
of
danger
is
the
post
of
duty
,
let
him
stay
,
and
he
can
*NL*
spend
his
vacations
with
us
.
I
think
both
you
and
Iola
need
rest
and
*NL*
change
.
Mother
longs
to
see
you
before
she
dies
.
She
feels
that
we
have
*NL*
been
the
children
of
many
prayers
and
tears
,
and
I
want
to
make
her
last
*NL*
days
as
happy
as
possible
.
The
South
has
not
been
a
paradise
to
you
all
*NL*
the
time
,
and
I
should
think
you
would
be
willing
to
leave
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
is
so
.
Iola
needs
rest
and
change
,
and
she
would
be
such
a
*NL*
comfort
to
mother

I
suppose
,
for
her
sake
,
I
will
consent
to
have
her
*NL*
go
back
with
you

at
least
for

*NL*
*NL*
In
a
few
days
,
with
many
prayers
and
tears
,
Marie
,
half
reluctantly
,
*NL*
permitted
Iola
to
start
for
the
North
in
company
with
Robert
Johnson
,
*NL*
intending
to
follow
as
soon
as
she
could
settle
her
business
and
see
*NL*
Harry
in
a
good
boarding
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
Very
joyful
was
the
greeting
of
the
dear
grandmother
.
Iola
soon
nestled
*NL*
in
her
heart
and
lent
additional
sunshine
to
her
once
checkered
life
,
*NL*
and
Robert
,
who
had
so
long
been
robbed
of
kith
and
kin
,
was
delighted
*NL*
with
the
new
accession
to
his
home

CHAPTER

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
NORTHERN
EXPERIENCE
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Uncle
Robert
,
''
said
Iola
,
after
she
had
been
North
several
weeks
,
``
I
*NL*
have
a
theory
that
every
woman
ought
to
know
how
to
earn
her
own
living
.
*NL*
I
believe
that
a
great
amount
of
sin
and
misery
springs
from
the
*NL*
weakness
and
inefficiency
of
women
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
that
's
so
,
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
to
join
the
great
rank
of
bread-winners
.
Mr.
Waterman
has
*NL*
advertised
for
a
number
of
saleswomen
,
and
I
intend
to
make
*NL*
application
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
he
advertises
for
help
he
means
white
women
,
''
said
Robert
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
said
nothing
about
color
,
''
responded
Iola
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
suppose
he
did
.
He
does
n't
expect
any
colored
girl
to
apply
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
think
I
could
fill
the
place
.
At
least
I
should
like
to
try
.
*NL*
And
I
do
not
think
when
I
apply
that
I
am
in
duty
bound
to
tell
him
my
*NL*
great-grandmother
was
a
negro
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
child
,
there
is
no
necessity
for
you
to
go
out
to
work
.
You
are
*NL*
perfectly
welcome
here
,
and
I
hope
that
you
feel
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
certainly
do
.
But
still
I
would
rather
earn
my
own
living
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
morning
Iola
applied
for
the
situation
,
and
,
being
prepossessing
in
*NL*
her
appearance
,
she
obtained
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
awhile
everything
went
as
pleasantly
as
a
marriage
bell
.
But
one
day
*NL*
a
young
colored
lady
,
well-dressed
and
well-bred
in
her
manner
,
entered
*NL*
the
store
.
It
was
an
acquaintance
which
Iola
had
formed
in
the
colored
*NL*
church
which
she
attended
.
Iola
gave
her
a
few
words
of
cordial
*NL*
greeting
,
and
spent
a
few
moments
chatting
with
her
.
The
attention
of
*NL*
the
girls
who
sold
at
the
same
counter
was
attracted
,
and
their
*NL*
suspicion
awakened
.
Iola
was
a
stranger
in
that
city
.
Who
was
she
,
and
*NL*
who
were
her
people
?
At
last
it
was
decided
that
one
of
the
girls
should
*NL*
act
as
a
spy
,
and
bring
what
information
she
could
concerning
Iola
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
spy
was
successful
.
She
found
out
that
Iola
was
living
in
a
good
*NL*
neighborhood
,
but
that
none
of
the
neighbors
knew
her
.
The
man
of
the
*NL*
house
was
very
fair
,
but
there
was
an
old
woman
whom
Iola
called
*NL*
``
Grandma
,
''
and
she
was
unmistakably
colored
.
The
story
was
sufficient
.
*NL*
If
that
were
true
,
Iola
must
be
colored
,
and
she
should
be
treated
*NL*
accordingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Without
knowing
the
cause
,
Iola
noticed
a
chill
in
the
social
atmosphere
*NL*
of
the
store
,
which
communicated
itself
to
the
cash-boys
,
and
they
*NL*
treated
her
so
insolently
that
her
situation
became
very
uncomfortable
.
*NL*
She
saw
the
proprietor
,
resigned
her
position
,
and
asked
for
and
*NL*
obtained
a
letter
of
recommendation
to
another
merchant
who
had
*NL*
advertised
for
a
saleswoman
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
applying
for
the
place
,
she
took
the
precaution
to
inform
her
*NL*
employer
that
she
was
colored
.
It
made
no
difference
to
him
;
but
he
*NL*
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
say
anything
about
it
to
the
girls
.
They
might
not
be
willing
to
*NL*
work
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Iola
smiled
,
did
not
promise
,
and
accepted
the
situation
.
She
entered
*NL*
upon
her
duties
,
and
proved
quite
acceptable
as
a
saleswoman
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
during
an
interval
in
business
,
the
girls
began
to
talk
of
*NL*
their
respective
churches
,
and
the
question
was
put
to
Iola
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
do
you
go
to
church
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
go
,
''
she
replied
,
``
to
Rev.
River
's
church
,
corner
of
Eighth
and
L
*NL*
Streets
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
;
you
must
be
mistaken
.
There
is
no
church
there
except
a
colored
*NL*
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
where
I
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
go
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
liked
it
when
I
came
here
,
and
joined
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
member
of
a
colored
church
?
What
under
heaven
possessed
you
to
do
*NL*
such
a
thing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
wished
to
be
with
my
own
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
interrogator
stopped
,
and
looked
surprised
and
pained
,
and
*NL*
almost
instinctively
moved
a
little
farther
from
her
.
After
the
store
*NL*
was
closed
,
the
girls
had
an
animated
discussion
,
which
resulted
in
the
*NL*
information
being
sent
to
Mr.
Cohen
that
Iola
was
a
colored
girl
,
and
*NL*
that
they
protested
against
her
being
continued
in
his
employ
.
Mr.
Cohen
*NL*
yielded
to
the
pressure
,
and
informed
Iola
that
her
services
were
no
*NL*
longer
needed
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Robert
came
home
in
the
evening
,
he
found
that
Iola
had
lost
her
*NL*
situation
,
and
was
looking
somewhat
discouraged
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
uncle
,
''
she
said
,
``
I
feel
out
of
heart
.
It
seems
as
if
the
*NL*
prejudice
pursues
us
through
every
avenue
of
life
,
and
assigns
us
the
*NL*
lowest
places
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
so
,
''
replied
Robert
,
thoughtfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
I
am
determined
,
''
said
Iola
,
``
to
win
for
myself
a
place
in
the
*NL*
fields
of
labor
.
I
have
heard
of
a
place
in
New
England
,
and
I
mean
to
*NL*
try
for
it
,
even
if
I
only
stay
a
few
months
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
if
you
_
will
_
go
,
say
nothing
about
your
color
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Uncle
Robert
,
I
see
no
necessity
for
proclaiming
that
fact
on
the
*NL*
house-top
.
Yet
I
am
resolved
that
nothing
shall
tempt
me
to
deny
it
.
The
*NL*
best
blood
in
my
veins
is
African
blood
,
and
I
am
not
ashamed
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hurrah
for
you
!
''
exclaimed
Robert
,
laughing
heartily
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Iola
wished
to
try
the
world
for
herself
,
and
so
be
prepared
for
any
*NL*
emergency
,
her
uncle
and
grandmother
were
content
to
have
her
go
to
New
*NL*
England
.
The
town
to
which
she
journeyed
was
only
a
few
hours
'
ride
from
*NL*
the
city
of
P
--
,
and
Robert
,
knowing
that
there
is
no
teacher
like
*NL*
experience
,
was
willing
that
Iola
should
have
the
benefit
of
her
*NL*
teaching
.
*NL*
*NL*
Iola
,
on
arriving
in
H
--
,
sought
the
firm
,
and
was
informed
that
her
*NL*
services
were
needed
.
She
found
it
a
pleasant
and
lucrative
position
.
*NL*
There
was
only
one
drawback
--
her
boarding
place
was
too
far
from
her
*NL*
work
.
There
was
an
institution
conducted
by
professed
Christian
women
,
*NL*
which
was
for
the
special
use
of
respectable
young
working
girls
.
This
*NL*
was
in
such
a
desirable
location
that
she
called
at
the
house
to
engage
*NL*
board
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
matron
conducted
her
over
the
house
,
and
grew
so
friendly
in
the
*NL*
interview
that
she
put
her
arm
around
her
,
and
seemed
to
look
upon
Iola
*NL*
as
a
desirable
accession
to
the
home
.
But
,
just
as
Iola
was
leaving
,
she
*NL*
said
to
the
matron
:
``
I
must
be
honest
with
you
;
I
am
a
colored
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Swift
as
light
a
change
passed
over
the
face
of
the
matron
.
She
withdrew
*NL*
her
arm
from
Iola
,
and
said
:
``
I
must
see
the
board
of
managers
about
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
board
met
,
Iola
's
case
was
put
before
them
,
but
they
decided
*NL*
not
to
receive
her
.
And
these
women
,
professors
of
a
religion
which
*NL*
taught
,
``
If
ye
have
respect
to
persons
ye
commit
sin
,
''
virtually
shut
*NL*
the
door
in
her
face
because
of
the
outcast
blood
in
her
veins
.
*NL*
*NL*
Considerable
feeling
was
aroused
by
the
action
of
these
women
,
who
,
to
*NL*
say
the
least
,
had
not
put
their
religion
in
the
most
favorable
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
Iola
continued
to
work
for
the
firm
until
she
received
letters
from
her
*NL*
mother
and
uncle
,
which
informed
her
that
her
mother
,
having
arranged
*NL*
her
affairs
in
the
South
,
was
ready
to
come
North
.
She
then
resolved
to
*NL*
return
,
to
the
city
of
P
--
,
to
be
ready
to
welcome
her
mother
on
her
*NL*
arrival
.
*NL*
*NL*
Iola
arrived
in
time
to
see
that
everything
was
in
order
for
her
*NL*
mother
's
reception
.
Her
room
was
furnished
neatly
,
but
with
those
*NL*
touches
of
beauty
that
womanly
hands
are
such
adepts
in
giving
.
A
few
*NL*
charming
pictures
adorned
the
walls
,
and
an
easy
chair
stood
waiting
to
*NL*
receive
the
travel-worn
mother
.
Robert
and
Iola
met
her
at
the
depot
;
*NL*
and
grandma
was
on
her
feet
at
the
first
sound
of
the
bell
,
opened
the
*NL*
door
,
clasped
Marie
to
her
heart
,
and
nearly
fainted
for
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
it
be
possible
dat
dis
is
my
little
Marie
?
''
she
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
did
seem
almost
impossible
to
realize
that
this
faded
woman
,
with
*NL*
pale
cheeks
and
prematurely
whitened
hair
,
was
the
rosy-cheeked
child
*NL*
from
whom
she
had
been
parted
more
than
thirty
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Robert
,
after
the
first
joyous
greeting
was
over
,
``
love
is
*NL*
a
very
good
thing
,
but
Marie
has
had
a
long
journey
and
needs
something
*NL*
that
will
stick
by
the
ribs
.
How
about
dinner
,
mother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
ready
,
''
said
Mrs.
Johnson
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
Marie
had
gone
to
her
room
and
changed
her
dress
,
she
came
down
*NL*
and
partook
of
the
delicious
repast
which
her
mother
and
Iola
had
*NL*
prepared
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
few
days
Marie
was
settled
in
the
home
,
and
was
well
pleased
with
*NL*
the
change
.
The
only
drawback
to
her
happiness
was
the
absence
of
her
*NL*
son
,
and
she
expected
him
to
come
North
after
the
closing
of
his
school
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Uncle
Robert
,
''
said
Iola
,
after
her
mother
had
been
with
them
several
*NL*
weeks
,
``
I
am
tired
of
being
idle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
now
?
''
asked
Robert
.
``
You
are
surely
not
going
East
*NL*
again
,
and
leave
your
mother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
hope
not
,
''
said
Marie
,
anxiously
.
``
I
have
been
so
long
without
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
mamma
,
I
am
not
going
East
.
I
can
get
suitable
employment
here
in
*NL*
the
city
of
P
--
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Iola
,
''
said
Robert
,
``
you
have
tried
,
and
been
defeated
.
Why
*NL*
subject
yourself
to
the
same
experience
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Uncle
Robert
,
I
think
that
every
woman
should
have
some
skill
or
art
*NL*
which
would
insure
her
at
least
a
comfortable
support
.
I
believe
there
*NL*
would
be
less
unhappy
marriages
if
labor
were
more
honored
among
women
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Iola
,
''
said
her
mother
,
``
what
is
your
skill
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nursing
.
I
was
very
young
when
I
went
into
the
hospital
,
but
I
*NL*
succeeded
so
well
that
the
doctor
said
I
must
have
been
a
born
nurse
.
*NL*
Now
,
I
see
by
the
papers
,
that
a
gentleman
who
has
an
invalid
daughter
*NL*
wants
some
one
who
can
be
a
nurse
and
companion
for
her
,
and
I
mean
to
*NL*
apply
for
the
situation
.
I
do
not
think
,
if
I
do
my
part
well
in
that
*NL*
position
,
that
the
blood
in
my
veins
will
be
any
bar
to
my
success
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
troubled
look
stole
over
Marie
's
face
.
She
sighed
faintly
,
but
made
no
*NL*
remonstrance
.
And
so
it
was
decided
that
Iola
should
apply
for
the
*NL*
situation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Iola
made
application
,
and
was
readily
accepted
.
Her
patient
was
a
frail
*NL*
girl
of
fifteen
summers
,
who
was
ill
with
a
low
fever
.
Iola
nursed
her
*NL*
carefully
,
and
soon
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
her
restored
to
*NL*
health
.
During
her
stay
,
Mr.
Cloten
,
the
father
of
the
invalid
,
had
*NL*
learned
some
of
the
particulars
of
Iola
's
Northern
experience
as
a
*NL*
bread-winner
,
and
he
resolved
to
give
her
employment
in
his
store
when
*NL*
her
services
were
no
longer
needed
in
the
house
.
As
soon
as
a
vacancy
*NL*
occurred
he
gave
Iola
a
place
in
his
store
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
morning
she
entered
on
her
work
he
called
his
employes
together
,
and
*NL*
told
them
that
Miss
Iola
had
colored
blood
in
her
veins
,
but
that
he
was
*NL*
going
to
employ
her
and
give
her
a
desk
.
If
any
one
objected
to
working
*NL*
with
her
,
he
or
she
could
step
to
the
cashier
's
desk
and
receive
what
*NL*
was
due
.
Not
a
man
remonstrated
,
not
a
woman
demurred
;
and
Iola
at
last
*NL*
found
a
place
in
the
great
army
of
bread-winners
,
which
the
traditions
*NL*
of
her
blood
could
not
affect
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
did
you
succeed
?
''
asked
Mrs.
Cloten
of
her
husband
,
when
he
*NL*
returned
to
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Admirably
!
`
Everything
is
lovely
and
the
goose
hangs
high
.
'
I
gave
my
*NL*
employes
to
understand
that
they
could
leave
if
they
did
not
wish
to
*NL*
work
with
Miss
Leroy
.
Not
one
of
them
left
,
or
showed
any
disposition
*NL*
to
rebel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
glad
,
''
said
Mrs.
Cloten
.
``
I
am
ashamed
of
the
way
she
has
been
*NL*
treated
in
our
city
,
when
seeking
to
do
her
share
in
the
world
's
work
.
I
*NL*
am
glad
that
you
were
brave
enough
to
face
this
cruel
prejudice
,
and
*NL*
give
her
a
situation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
dear
,
do
not
make
me
a
hero
for
a
single
act
.
I
am
grateful
*NL*
for
the
care
Miss
Leroy
gave
our
Daisy
.
Money
can
buy
services
,
but
it
*NL*
can
not
purchase
tender
,
loving
sympathy
.
I
was
also
determined
to
let
my
*NL*
employes
know
that
I
,
not
they
,
commanded
my
business
.
So
,
do
not
crown
*NL*
me
a
hero
until
I
have
won
a
niche
in
the
temple
of
fame
.
In
dealing
*NL*
with
Southern
prejudice
against
the
negro
,
we
Northerners
could
do
it
*NL*
with
better
grace
if
we
divested
ourselves
of
our
own
.
We
irritate
the
*NL*
South
by
our
criticisms
,
and
,
while
I
confess
that
there
is
much
that
is
*NL*
reprehensible
in
their
treatment
of
colored
people
,
yet
if
our
Northern
*NL*
civilization
is
higher
than
theirs
we
should
`
criticise
by
creation
.
'
We
*NL*
should
stamp
ourselves
on
the
South
,
and
not
let
the
South
stamp
itself
*NL*
on
us
.
When
we
have
learned
to
treat
men
according
to
the
complexion
of
*NL*
their
souls
,
and
not
the
color
of
their
skins
,
we
will
have
given
our
*NL*
best
contribution
towards
the
solution
of
the
negro
problem
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
feel
,
my
dear
,
''
said
Mrs.
Cloten
,
``
that
what
you
have
done
is
a
right
*NL*
step
in
the
right
direction
,
and
I
hope
that
other
merchants
will
do
the
*NL*
same
.
We
have
numbers
of
business
men
,
rich
enough
to
afford
themselves
*NL*
the
luxury
of
a
good
conscience

CHAPTER

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
AN
OLD
FRIEND
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-morning
,
Miss
Leroy
,
''
said
a
cheery
voice
in
tones
of
glad
*NL*
surprise
,
and
,
intercepting
her
path
,
Dr.
Gresham
stood
before
Iola
,
*NL*
smiling
,
and
reaching
out
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Dr.
Gresham
,
is
this
you
?
''
said
Iola
,
lifting
her
eyes
to
that
*NL*
well-remembered
face
.
``
It
has
been
several
years
since
we
met
.
How
have
*NL*
you
been
all
this
time
,
and
where
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
sick
,
and
am
just
now
recovering
from
malaria
and
nervous
*NL*
prostration
.
I
am
attending
a
medical
convention
in
this
city
,
and
hope
*NL*
that
I
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Iola
hesitated
,
and
then
replied
:
``
I
should
be
pleased
to
have
you
*NL*
call
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
give
me
great
pleasure
.
Where
shall
I
call
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
home
is
1006
South
Street
,
but
I
am
only
at
home
in
the
evenings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
walked
together
a
short
distance
till
they
reached
Mr.
Cloten
's
*NL*
store
;
then
,
bidding
the
doctor
good
morning
,
Iola
left
him
repeating
to
*NL*
himself
the
words
of
his
favorite
poet
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
art
too
lovely
and
precious
a
gem
*NL*
To
be
bound
to
their
burdens
and
sullied
by
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
noticed
the
deep
flush
on
Iola
's
face
as
she
entered
the
store
,
*NL*
nor
the
subdued
,
quiet
manner
with
which
she
applied
herself
to
her
*NL*
tasks
.
She
was
living
over
again
the
past
,
with
its
tender
,
sad
,
and
*NL*
thrilling
reminiscences
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
Dr.
Gresham
called
on
Iola
.
She
met
him
with
a
pleasant
*NL*
welcome
.
Dr.
Gresham
gazed
upon
her
with
unfeigned
admiration
,
and
*NL*
thought
that
the
years
,
instead
of
detracting
from
,
had
only
*NL*
intensified
,
her
loveliness
.
He
had
thought
her
very
beautiful
in
the
*NL*
hospital
,
in
her
gray
dress
and
white
collar
,
with
her
glorious
wealth
*NL*
of
hair
drawn
over
her
ears
.
But
now
,
when
he
saw
her
with
that
hair
*NL*
artistically
arranged
,
and
her
finely-proportioned
form
arrayed
in
a
*NL*
dark
crimson
dress
,
relieved
by
a
shimmer
of
lace
and
a
bow
of
white
*NL*
ribbon
at
her
throat
,
he
thought
her
superbly
handsome
.
The
lines
which
*NL*
care
had
written
upon
her
young
face
had
faded
away
.
There
was
no
*NL*
undertone
of
sorrow
in
her
voice
as
she
stood
up
before
him
in
the
calm
*NL*
loveliness
of
her
ripened
womanhood
,
radiant
in
beauty
and
gifted
in
*NL*
intellect
.
Time
and
failing
health
had
left
their
traces
upon
Dr.
*NL*
Gresham
.
His
step
was
less
bounding
,
his
cheek
a
trifle
paler
,
his
*NL*
manner
somewhat
graver
than
it
was
when
he
had
parted
from
Iola
in
the
*NL*
hospital
,
but
his
meeting
with
her
had
thrilled
his
heart
with
*NL*
unexpected
pleasure
.
Hopes
and
sentiments
which
long
had
slept
awoke
at
*NL*
the
touch
of
her
hand
and
the
tones
of
her
voice
,
and
Dr.
Gresham
found
*NL*
himself
turning
to
the
past
,
with
its
sad
memories
and
disappointed
*NL*
hopes
.
No
other
face
had
displaced
her
image
in
his
mind
;
no
other
love
*NL*
had
woven
itself
around
every
tendril
of
his
soul
.
His
heart
and
hand
*NL*
were
just
as
free
as
they
were
the
hour
they
had
parted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
see
you
again
,
''
said
Dr.
Gresham
,
``
is
a
great
and
unexpected
*NL*
pleasure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
not
forgotten
me
,
then
?
''
said
Iola
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forget
you
!
I
would
just
as
soon
forget
my
own
existence
.
I
do
not
*NL*
think
that
time
will
ever
efface
the
impressions
of
those
days
in
which
*NL*
we
met
so
often
.
When
last
we
met
you
were
intending
to
search
for
your
*NL*
mother
.
Have
you
been
successful
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
More
than
successful
,
''
said
Iola
,
with
a
joyous
ring
in
her
voice
.
``
I
*NL*
have
found
my
mother
,
brother
,
grandmother
,
and
uncle
,
and
,
except
my
*NL*
brother
,
we
are
all
living
together
,
and
we
are
so
happy
.
Excuse
me
a
*NL*
few
minutes
,
''
she
said
,
and
left
the
room
.
Iola
soon
returned
,
bringing
*NL*
with
her
her
mother
and
grandmother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
,
''
said
Iola
,
introducing
her
mother
and
grandmother
,
``
are
the
*NL*
once-severed
branches
of
our
family
;
and
this
gentleman
you
have
seen
*NL*
before
,
''
continued
Iola
,
as
Robert
entered
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Gresham
looked
scrutinizingly
at
him
and
said
:
``
Your
face
looks
*NL*
familiar
,
but
I
saw
so
many
faces
at
the
hospital
that
I
can
not
just
now
*NL*
recall
your
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doctor
,
''
said
Robert
Johnson
,
``
I
was
one
of
your
last
patients
,
and
I
*NL*
was
with
Tom
Anderson
when
he
died
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
''
replied
Dr.
Gresham
;
``
it
all
comes
back
to
me
.
You
were
*NL*
wounded
at
the
battle
of
Five
Forks
,
were
you
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Robert
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
saw
you
when
you
were
recovering
.
You
told
me
that
you
thought
you
*NL*
had
a
clue
to
your
lost
relatives
,
from
whom
you
had
been
so
long
*NL*
separated
.
How
have
you
succeeded
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Admirably
!
I
have
been
fortunate
in
finding
my
mother
,
my
sister
,
and
*NL*
her
children
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
indeed
!
I
am
delighted
to
hear
it
.
Where
are
they
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
right
here
.
This
is
my
mother
,
''
said
Robert
,
bending
fondly
*NL*
over
her
,
as
she
returned
his
recognition
with
an
expression
of
intense
*NL*
satisfaction
;
``
and
this
,
''
he
continued
,
``
is
my
sister
,
and
Miss
Leroy
is
*NL*
my
niece
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
possible
?
I
am
very
glad
to
hear
it
.
It
has
been
said
that
every
*NL*
cloud
has
its
silver
lining
,
and
the
silver
lining
of
our
war
cloud
is
*NL*
the
redemption
of
a
race
and
the
reunion
of
severed
hearts
.
War
is
a
*NL*
dreadful
thing
;
but
worse
than
the
war
was
the
slavery
which
preceded
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Slavery
,
''
said
Iola
,
``
was
a
fearful
cancer
eating
into
the
nation
's
*NL*
heart
,
sapping
its
vitality
,
and
undermining
its
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
war
,
''
said
Dr.
Gresham
,
``
was
the
dreadful
surgery
by
which
the
*NL*
disease
was
eradicated
.
The
cancer
has
been
removed
,
but
for
years
to
*NL*
come
I
fear
that
we
will
have
to
deal
with
the
effects
of
the
disease
.
*NL*
But
I
believe
that
we
have
vitality
enough
to
outgrow
those
effects
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
,
Doctor
,
''
said
Iola
,
``
that
there
is
but
one
remedy
by
which
our
*NL*
nation
can
recover
from
the
evil
entailed
upon
her
by
slavery
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
that
?
''
asked
Robert
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
fuller
comprehension
of
the
claims
of
the
Gospel
of
Jesus
Christ
,
and
*NL*
their
application
to
our
national
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Robert
;
``
while
politicians
are
stumbling
on
the
barren
*NL*
mountains
of
fretful
controversy
and
asking
what
shall
we
do
with
the
*NL*
negro
?
I
hold
that
Jesus
answered
that
question
nearly
two
thousand
*NL*
years
ago
when
he
said
,
`
Whatsoever
ye
would
that
men
should
do
to
you
,
*NL*
do
ye
even
so
to
them
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Dr.
Gresham
;
``
the
application
of
that
rule
in
dealing
with
*NL*
the
negro
would
solve
the
whole
problem
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Slavery
,
''
said
Mrs.
Leroy
,
``
is
dead
,
but
the
spirit
which
animated
it
*NL*
still
lives
;
and
I
think
that
a
reckless
disregard
for
human
life
is
*NL*
more
the
outgrowth
of
slavery
than
any
actual
hatred
of
the
negro
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
problem
of
the
nation
,
''
continued
Dr.
Gresham
,
``
is
not
what
men
*NL*
will
do
with
the
negro
,
but
what
will
they
do
with
the
reckless
,
lawless
*NL*
white
men
who
murder
,
lynch
and
burn
their
fellow-citizens
.
To
me
these
*NL*
lynchings
and
burnings
are
perfectly
alarming
.
Both
races
have
reacted
*NL*
on
each
other
--
men
fettered
the
slave
and
cramped
their
own
souls
;
*NL*
denied
him
knowledge
,
and
darkened
their
spiritual
insight
;
subdued
him
*NL*
to
the
pliancy
of
submission
,
and
in
their
turn
became
the
thralls
of
*NL*
public
opinion
.
The
negro
came
here
from
the
heathenism
of
Africa
;
but
*NL*
the
young
colonies
could
not
take
into
their
early
civilization
a
stream
*NL*
of
barbaric
blood
without
being
affected
by
its
influence
and
the
negro
,
*NL*
poor
and
despised
as
he
is
,
has
laid
his
hands
on
our
Southern
*NL*
civilization
and
helped
mould
its
character
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Mrs.
Leroy
;
``
the
colored
nurse
could
not
nestle
her
master
's
*NL*
child
in
her
arms
,
hold
up
his
baby
footsteps
on
their
floors
,
and
walk
*NL*
with
him
through
the
impressible
and
formative
period
of
his
young
life
*NL*
without
leaving
upon
him
the
impress
of
her
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
,
''
said
Robert
,
``
for
the
whole
nation
's
sake
,
that
slavery
*NL*
has
been
destroyed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
our
work
,
''
said
Dr.
Gresham
,
``
is
to
build
over
the
desolations
of
*NL*
the
past
a
better
and
brighter
future
.
The
great
distinction
between
*NL*
savagery
and
civilization
is
the
creation
and
maintenance
of
law
.
*NL*
A
people
can
not
habitually
trample
on
law
and
justice
without
*NL*
retrograding
toward
barbarism
.
But
I
am
hopeful
that
time
will
bring
us
*NL*
changes
for
the
better
;
that
,
as
we
get
farther
away
from
the
war
,
we
*NL*
will
outgrow
the
animosities
and
prejudices
engendered
by
slavery
.
The
*NL*
short-sightedness
of
our
fathers
linked
the
negro
's
destiny
to
ours
.
We
*NL*
are
feeling
the
friction
of
the
ligatures
which
bind
us
together
,
but
I
*NL*
hope
that
the
time
will
speedily
come
when
the
best
members
of
both
*NL*
races
will
unite
for
the
maintenance
of
law
and
order
and
the
progress
*NL*
and
prosperity
of
the
country
,
and
that
the
intelligence
and
virtue
of
*NL*
the
South
will
be
strong
to
grapple
effectually
with
its
ignorance
and
*NL*
vice
.

Marie

``

with

To
whom

to-day

*NL*
``
Taking

Mrs.

,
her

aglow
with

*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Gresham
gazed
admiringly
upon
Iola

A
glow
of
enthusiasm
overspread
*NL*
her
beautiful
,
expressive
face
.
There
was
a
rapt
and
far-off
look
in
her
*NL*
eye
,
as
if
she
were
looking
beyond
the
present
pain
to
a
brighter
*NL*
future
for
the
race
with
which
she
was
identified
,
and
felt
the
*NL*
grandeur
of
a
divine
commission
to
labor
for
its
uplifting
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Dr.
Gresham
was
parting
with
Robert
,
he
said
:
``
This
meeting
has
been
*NL*
a
very
unexpected
pleasure

I
have
spent
a
delightful
evening

I
only

regret
that
I
had
not
others
to
share
it
with

a
regular

is
stopping

the

,
as
he
left
the
door

*NL*
*NL*
When
Robert
returned
to
the
parlor
he
said
to
Iola
:

it

CHAPTER
XXVI
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
OPEN
QUESTIONS
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
Robert
and
Rev.
Carmicle
called
on
Dr.
Gresham
,
and
found
*NL*
Dr.
Latrobe
,
the
Southerner
,
and
a
young
doctor
by
the
name
of
Latimer
,
*NL*
already
there
.
Dr.
Gresham
introduced
Dr.
Latrobe
,
but
it
was
a
new
*NL*
experience
to
receive
colored
men
socially
.
His
wits
,
however
,
did
not
*NL*
forsake
him
,
and
he
received
the
introduction
and
survived
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Permit
me
,
now
,
''
said
Dr.
Gresham
,
``
to
introduce
you
to
my
friend
,
Dr.
*NL*
Latimer
,
who
is
attending
our
convention
.
He
expects
to
go
South
and
*NL*
labor
among
the
colored
people
.
Do
n't
you
think
that
there
is
a
large
*NL*
field
of
usefulness
before
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
replied
Dr.
Latrobe
,
``
if
he
will
let
politics
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
let
politics
alone
?
''
asked
Dr.
Gresham
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
,
''
replied
Dr.
Latrobe
,
``
we
Southerners
will
never
submit
to
*NL*
negro
supremacy
.
We
will
never
abandon
our
Caucasian
civilization
to
an
*NL*
inferior
race
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
any
reason
,
''
inquired
Rev.
Carmicle
,
``
to
dread
that
a
race
*NL*
which
has
behind
it
the
heathenism
of
Africa
and
the
slavery
of
America
,
*NL*
with
its
inheritance
of
ignorance
and
poverty
,
will
be
able
,
in
less
*NL*
than
one
generation
,
to
domineer
over
a
race
which
has
behind
it
ages
of
*NL*
dominion
,
freedom
,
education
,
and
Christianity
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
slight
shade
of
vexation
and
astonishment
passed
over
the
face
of
Dr.
*NL*
Latrobe
.
He
hesitated
a
moment
,
then
replied
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
afraid
of
the
negro
as
he
stands
alone
,
but
what
I
dread
is
*NL*
that
in
some
closely-contested
election
ambitious
men
will
use
him
to
*NL*
hold
the
balance
of
power
and
make
him
an
element
of
danger
.
He
is
*NL*
ignorant
,
poor
,
and
clannish
,
and
they
may
impact
him
as
their
policy
*NL*
would
direct
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Any
more
,
''
asked
Robert
,
``
than
the
leaders
of
the
Rebellion
did
the
*NL*
ignorant
,
poor
whites
during
our
late
conflict
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ignorance
,
poverty
,
and
clannishness
,
''
said
Dr.
Gresham
,
``
are
more
*NL*
social
than
racial
conditions
,
which
may
be
outgrown
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
think
,
''
said
Rev.
Carmicle
,
``
that
we
are
outgrowing
them
as
fast
*NL*
as
any
other
people
would
have
done
under
the
same
conditions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
negro
,
''
replied
Dr.
Latrobe
,
``
always
has
been
and
always
will
be
an
*NL*
element
of
discord
in
our
country
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
then
,
is
your
remedy
?
''
asked
Dr.
Gresham
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
eliminate
him
from
the
politics
of
the
country
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
disfranchisement
is
a
punishment
for
crime
,
is
it
just
to
punish
a
*NL*
man
before
he
transgresses
the
law
?
''
asked
Dr.
Gresham
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
,
''
said
Dr.
Latimer
,
``
the
negro
is
ignorant
,
poor
,
and
clannish
,
let
*NL*
us
remember
that
in
part
of
our
land
it
was
once
a
crime
to
teach
him
to
*NL*
read
.
If
he
is
poor
,
for
ages
he
was
forced
to
bend
to
unrequited
toil
.
*NL*
If
he
is
clannish
,
society
has
segregated
him
to
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
even
,
''
said
Robert
,
``
has
given
him
a
negro
pew
in
your
churches
*NL*
and
a
negro
seat
at
your
communion
table
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wisely
,
or
unwisely
,
''
said
Dr.
Gresham
,
``
the
Government
has
put
the
*NL*
ballot
in
his
hands
.
It
is
better
to
teach
him
to
use
that
ballot
aright
*NL*
than
to
intimidate
him
by
violence
or
vitiate
his
vote
by
fraud
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To-day
,
''
said
Dr.
Latimer
,
``
the
negro
is
not
plotting
in
beer-saloons
*NL*
against
the
peace
and
order
of
society
.
His
fingers
are
not
dripping
*NL*
with
dynamite
,
neither
is
he
spitting
upon
your
flag
,
nor
flaunting
the
*NL*
red
banner
of
anarchy
in
your
face

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Power
,
''
said
Dr.
Gresham
,
``
naturally
gravitates
into
the
strongest
*NL*
hands
.
The
class
who
have
the
best
brain
and
most
wealth
can
strike
with
*NL*
the
heaviest
hand
.
I
have
too
much
faith
in
the
inherent
power
of
the
*NL*
white
race
to
dread
the
competition

any
other
people
under

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
Northerners
fail
to
do
us
justice

said
Dr.
Latrobe
.
``
The
*NL*
men
into
whose
hands
you
put
the
ballot
were
our
slaves

we
would
*NL*
rather
die
than
submit
to
them
.
Look
at
the
carpet-bag
governments
the
*NL*
wicked
policy
of
the
Government
inflicted
upon
us

It
was
only
done
to
*NL*
humiliate
us

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
!

said
Dr.
Gresham
,
flushing
,
and
rising
to
his
feet
.
``
We
had
no
*NL*
other
alternative
than
putting
the
ballot
in
their

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not
deny
,
''
said
Rev.
Carmicle
,
``
that
we
have
made
woeful
*NL*
mistakes

but
with
our
antecedents
it
would
have
been
miraculous
if

had
never
committed
any
mistakes
or
made
any
blunders

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They

continued
Dr.
Gresham

*NL*
``
Protect

said
Robert
,
bitterly
.
``
What
protection
does
*NL*
the
colored

receive

I
know

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Johnson

''
said
Dr.
Gresham

compassionately
,
``
it
is
impossible
to
have
*NL*
a
policeman

the
back

each
colored

chair

a
squad
of
*NL*
soldiers
at
each
crossroad

to
detect
with
certainty
,
and
punish
with
*NL*
celerity
,
each
invasion
of
his
rights
.
We
tried
provisional
governments
*NL*
and
found
them
a
failure

It
seemed
like
leaving
our
former
allies

be
*NL*
mocked

the
name

freedom
and
tortured
with
the
essence

The
ballot

our
weapon

we
gave
it
to
them
for

``
And
there

Dr.
Latrobe

emphatically

Gresham
,
thoughtfully
,
``
is
not
the
only
branch
of
*NL*
the
human
race
which
has
been
low
down
in
the
scale
of
civilization

*NL*
freedom
,
and
which
has
outgrown
the
measure
of
his
chains
.
Slavery
,
*NL*
polygamy
,
and
human
sacrifices
have
been
practiced
among
Europeans
in
*NL*
by-gone
days
;
and
when
Tyndall
tells
us
that
out
of
savages
unable
to
*NL*
count
to
the
number

their
fingers
and
speaking
only
a
language
of
*NL*
nouns
and
verbs
,
arise
at
length
our
Newtons
and
Shakspeares
,
I
do
not
*NL*
see
that
the
negro
could
not
have
learned
our

received
our
*NL*
religion
without
the
intervention
of
ages
of
slavery

``
If

said
Rev.
Carmicle
,
``
Mohammedanism

with
its
imperfect
creed

is
*NL*
successful
in
gathering
large
numbers
of
negroes
beneath
the
Crescent
,
*NL*
could
not
a
legitimate
commerce
and
the
teachings
of
a
pure
Christianity
*NL*
have
done
as
much
to
plant
the
standard
of
the
Cross
over
the
ramparts

of
sin
and
idolatry
in
Africa

Surely
we
can
not
concede
that
the
light
*NL*
of
the
Crescent
is
greater
than
the
glory
of
the
Cross
,
that
there
is
*NL*
less
constraining
power
in
the
Christ
of
Calvary
than
in
the
Prophet
of
*NL*
Arabia
?
I
do
not
think
that
I
underrate
the
difficulties
in
your
way
*NL*
when
I
say
that
you
young
men
are
holding
in
your

golden

opportunities
which
it
would
be
madness

folly
to
throw
away

It
is

your

build
up
a

not
on

on

equal
justice

Do
this

After

Drs.

Gresham

sat
silent

awhile

broke
the

asking

from
one-ninth

that

DIVERGING
PATHS
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
eve
of
his
departure
from
the
city
of
P
--
,
Dr.
Gresham
called
*NL*
on
Iola
,
and
found
her
alone
.
They
talked
awhile
of
reminiscences
of
the
*NL*
war
and
hospital
life
,
when
Dr.
Gresham
,
approaching
Iola
,
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Leroy
,
I
am
glad
the
great
object
of
your
life
is
accomplished
,
*NL*
and
that
you
have
found
all
your
relatives
.
Years
have
passed
since
we
*NL*
parted
,
years
in
which
I
have
vainly
tried
to
get
a
trace
of
you
and
*NL*
have
been
baffled
,
but
I
have
found
you
at
last
!
''
Clasping
her
hand
in
*NL*
his
,
he
continued
,
``
I
would
it
were
so
that
I
should
never
lose
you
*NL*
again
!
Iola
,
will
you
not
grant
me
the
privilege
of
holding
this
hand
as
*NL*
mine
all
through
the
future
of
our
lives
?
Your
search
for
your
mother
is
*NL*
ended
.
She
is
well
cared
for
.
Are
you
not
free
at
last
to
share
with
me
*NL*
my
Northern
home
,
free
to
be
mine
as
nothing
else
on
earth
is
mine
.
''
Dr.
*NL*
Gresham
looked
eagerly
on
Iola
's
face
,
and
tried
to
read
its
varying
*NL*
expression
.
``
Iola
,
I
learned
to
love
you
in
the
hospital
.
I
have
tried
*NL*
to
forget
you
,
but
it
has
been
all
in
vain
.
Your
image
is
just
as
deeply
*NL*
engraven
on
my
heart
as
it
was
the
day
we
parted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doctor

she
replied
,
sadly
,
but
firmly
,
as
she
withdrew
her
hand
from
*NL*
his
,
``
I
feel
now
as
I
felt
then
,
that
there
is
an
insurmountable
barrier
*NL*
between
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
,
Iola
?
''
asked
Dr.
Gresham
,
anxiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
the
public
opinion
which
assigns
me
a
place
with
the
colored
*NL*
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
right
has
public
opinion
to
interfere
with
our
marriage
*NL*
relations
?
Why
should
we
yield
to
its
behests
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
it
is
stronger
than
we
are
,
and
we
can
not
run
counter
to
it
*NL*
without
suffering
its
penalties
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
are
they
,
Iola
?
Shadows
that
you
merely
dread
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
no
!
the
penalties
of
social
ostracism
North
and
South
,
except
here
*NL*
and
there
some
grand
and
noble
exceptions
.
I
do
not
think
that
you
fully
*NL*
realize
how
much
prejudice
against
colored
people
permeates
society
,
*NL*
lowers
the
tone
of
our
religion
,
and
reacts
upon
the
life
of
the
nation
.
*NL*
After
freedom
came
,
mamma
was
living
in
the
city
of
A
--
,
and
wanted
to
*NL*
unite
with
a
Christian
church
there
.
She
made
application
for
*NL*
membership
.
She
passed
her
examination
as
a
candidate
,
and
was
received
*NL*
as
a
church
member
.
When
she
was
about
to
make
her
first
communion
,
she
*NL*
unintentionally
took
her
seat
at
the
head
of
the
column
.
The
elder
who
*NL*
was
administering
the
communion
gave
her
the
bread
in
the
order
in
which
*NL*
she
sat
,
but
before
he
gave
her
the
wine
some
one
touched
him
on
the
*NL*
shoulder
and
whispered
a
word
in
his
ear
.
He
then
passed
mamma
by
,
gave
*NL*
the
cup
to
others
,
and
then
returned
to
her
.
From
that
rite
connected
*NL*
with
the
holiest
memories
of
earth
,
my
poor
mother
returned
humiliated
*NL*
and
depressed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
shame
!
''
exclaimed
Dr.
Gresham
,
indignantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
seen
,
''
continued
Iola
,
``
the
same
spirit
manifested
in
the
North
.
*NL*
Mamma
once
attempted
to
do
missionary
work
in
this
city
.
One
day
she
*NL*
found
an
outcast
colored
girl
,
whom
she
wished
to
rescue
.
She
took
her
*NL*
to
an
asylum
for
fallen
women
and
made
an
application
for
her
,
but
was
*NL*
refused
.
Colored
girls
were
not
received
there
.
Soon
after
mamma
found
*NL*
among
the
colored
people
an
outcast
white
girl
.
Mamma
's
sympathies
,
*NL*
unfettered
by
class
distinction
,
were
aroused
in
her
behalf
,
and
,
in
*NL*
company
with
two
white
ladies
,
she
went
with
the
girl
to
that
same
*NL*
refuge
.
For
her
the
door
was
freely
opened
and
admittance
readily
*NL*
granted
.
It
was
as
if
two
women
were
sinking
in
the
quicksands
,
and
on
*NL*
the
solid
land
stood
other
women
with
life-lines
in
their
hands
,
seeing
*NL*
the
deadly
sands
slowly
creeping
up
around
the
hapless
victims
.
To
one
*NL*
they
readily
threw
the
lines
of
deliverance
,
but
for
the
other
there
was
*NL*
not
one
strand
of
salvation
.
Sometime
since
,
to
the
same
asylum
,
came
a
*NL*
poor
fallen
girl
who
had
escaped
from
the
clutches
of
a
wicked
woman
.
*NL*
For
her
the
door
would
have
been
opened
,
had
not
the
vile
woman
from
*NL*
whom
she
was
escaping
followed
her
to
that
place
of
refuge
and
revealed
*NL*
the
fact
that
she
belonged
to
the
colored
race
.
That
fact
was
enough
to
*NL*
close
the
door
upon
her
,
and
to
send
her
back
to
sin
and
to
suffer
,
and
*NL*
perhaps
to
die
as
a
wretched
outcast
.
And
yet
in
this
city
where
a
*NL*
number
of
charities
are
advertised
,
I
do
not
think
there
is
one
of
them
*NL*
which
,
in
appealing
to
the
public
,
talks
more
religion
than
the
managers
*NL*
of
this
asylum
.
This
prejudice
against
the
colored
race
environs
our

I

Doctor

were

No

I
am
not
willing

*NL*

surely
you
paint
the
picture
too
darkly

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doctor
,
I
have
painted
it
with

It
is
easier
to
*NL*
outgrow
the
dishonor
of
crime
than
the
disabilities
of
color
.
You
have
*NL*
created
in
this
country
an
aristocracy
of
color
wide
enough
to
include
*NL*
the
South
with
its
treason
and
Utah
with
its
abominations

but
too
*NL*
narrow
to
include
the
best

bravest
colored
man
who
bared
his
breast
*NL*
to
the
bullets
of
the
enemy
during
your
fratricidal
strife

Is
not
the
*NL*
most
arrant
Rebel
to-day
more
acceptable
to
you
than
the
most
faithful
*NL*
colored
man

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

no

''
exclaimed
Dr.
Gresham
,
vehemently
.
``
You
are
wrong

I
belong
to

the
Grand
Army
of
the
Republic

We
have
no

were
such
a
thing
proposed
,
the
majority
of
our

,
I
believe
,
would
be
against
it
.
In
Congress
colored
men
have
*NL*
the
same
seats
as
white
men
,
and
the
color
line
is
slowly
fading
out
in
*NL*
our
public
institutions

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
is
it
in
the
Church

''
asked
Iola
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Church
is
naturally
conservative
.
It
preserves
old
truths
,
even
if
*NL*
it
is
somewhat
slow
in
embracing
new
ideas
.
It
has
its
social
as
well
as
*NL*
its
spiritual
side
.
Society
is
woman
's
realm
.
The
majority
of
church
*NL*
members
are
women
,
who
are
said
to
be
the
aristocratic
element
of
our
*NL*
country
.
I
fear
that
one
of
the
last
strongholds
of
this
racial
*NL*
prejudice
will
be
found
beneath
the
shadow
of
some
of
our
churches
.
I
*NL*
think
,
on
account
of
this
social
question
,
that
large
bodies
of
*NL*
Christian
temperance
women
and
other
reformers
,
in
trying
to
reach
the
*NL*
colored
people
even
for
their
own
good

will
be
quicker
to
form
*NL*
separate

our
National
Grand

whose
ranks
are
open
*NL*
to
black

white

liberals

conservatives
,
saints

agnostics
.
*NL*
But
,
Iola
,
we
have
drifted
far
away
from
the
question

No
one
has
a
*NL*
right
to
interfere
with
our
marriage
if
we
do
not
infringe
on
the
rights
*NL*
of
others

*NL*
``

she
replied

gently

``
I

I

when

through

I

gave

;
but
he
felt
it
was
useless
to
attempt
to
*NL*
divert
her
from

He
knew
that
for
the
true

something
more

He
knew
that

the
surrender

DR.
LATROBE
'S
MISTAKE
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
morning
previous
to
their
departure
for
their
respective
homes
,
*NL*
Dr.
Gresham
met
Dr.
Latrobe
in
the
parlor
of
the
Concordia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
,
''
asked
Dr.
Gresham
,
``
did
you
like
Dr.
Latimer
's
paper
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
much
,
indeed
.
It
was
excellent
.
He
is
a
very
talented
young
man
.
*NL*
He
sits
next
to
me
at
lunch
and
I
have
conversed
with
him
several
times
.
*NL*
He
is
very
genial
and
attractive
,
only
he
seems
to
be
rather
cranky
on
*NL*
the
negro
question
.
I
hope
if
he
comes
South
that
he
will
not
make
the
*NL*
mistake
of
mixing
up
with
the
negroes
.
It
would
be
throwing
away
his
*NL*
influence
and
ruining
his
prospects
.
He
seems
to
be
well
versed
in
*NL*
science
and
literature
and
would
make
a
very
delightful
accession
to
our
*NL*
social
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
,
''
replied
Dr.
Gresham
,
``
that
he
is
an
honor
to
our
profession
.
*NL*
He
is
one
of
the
finest
specimens
of
our
young
manhood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Just
then
Dr.
Latimer
entered
the
room
.
Dr.
Latrobe
arose
and
,
greeting
*NL*
him
cordially
,
said
:
``
I
was
delighted
with
your
paper
;
it
was
full
of
*NL*
thought
and
suggestion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
''
answered
Dr.
Latimer
,
``
it
was
my
aim
to
make
it
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
succeeded
admirably
,
''
replied
Dr.
Latrobe
.
``
I
could
not
help
*NL*
thinking
how
much
we
owe
to
heredity
and
environment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Dr.
Gresham
.
``
Continental
Europe
yearly
sends
to
our
shores
*NL*
subjects
to
be
developed
into
citizens
.
Emancipation
has
given
us
*NL*
millions
of
new
citizens
,
and
to
them
our
influence
and
example
should
*NL*
be
a
blessing
and
not
a
curse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Dr.
Latimer
,
``
I
intend
to
go
South
,
and
help
those
who
so
*NL*
much
need
helpers
from
their
own
ranks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
,
''
answered
Dr.
Latrobe
,
``
that
if
you
go
South
you
will
only
*NL*
sustain
business
relations
with
the
negroes
,
and
not
commit
the
folly
of
*NL*
equalizing
yourself
with
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
''
asked
Dr.
Latimer
,
steadily
looking
him
in
the
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
in
equalizing
yourself
with
them
you
drag
us
down
;
and
our
*NL*
social
customs
must
be
kept
intact
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
been
associating
with
me
at
the
convention
for
several
days
;
I
*NL*
do
not
see
that
the
contact
has
dragged
you
down
,
has
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
!
What
has
that
got
to
do
with
associating
with
niggers
?
''
asked
Dr.
*NL*
Latrobe
,
curtly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
blood
of
that
race
is
coursing
through
my
veins
.
I
am
one
of
them
,
''
*NL*
replied
Dr.
Latimer
,
proudly
raising
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
!
''
exclaimed
Dr.
Latrobe
,
with
an
air
of
profound
astonishment
and
*NL*
crimsoning
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
''
interposed
Dr.
Gresham
,
laughing
heartily
at
Dr.
Latrobe
's
*NL*
discomfiture
.
``
He
belongs
to
that
negro
race
both
by
blood
and
choice
.
*NL*
His
father
's
mother
made
overtures
to
receive
him
as
her
grandson
and
*NL*
heir
,
but
he
has
nobly
refused
to
forsake
his
mother
's
people
and
has
*NL*
cast
his
lot
with
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
,
''
said
Dr.
Latimer
,
``
would
have
despised
myself
if
I
had
done
*NL*
otherwise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
''
said
Dr.
Latrobe
,
rising
,
``
I
was
never
so
deceived
before
.
*NL*
Good
morning
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Latrobe
had
thought
he
was
clear-sighted
enough
to
detect
the
*NL*
presence
of
negro
blood
when
all
physical
traces
had
disappeared
.
But
he
*NL*
had
associated
with
Dr.
Latimer
for
several
days
,
and
admired
his
*NL*
talent
,
without
suspecting
for
one
moment
his
racial
connection
.
He
*NL*
could
not
help
feeling
a
sense
of
vexation
at
the
signal
mistake
he
had
*NL*
made
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Frank
Latimer
was
the
natural
grandson
of
a
Southern
lady
,
in
whose
*NL*
family
his
mother
had
been
a
slave
.
The
blood
of
a
proud
aristocratic
*NL*
ancestry
was
flowing
through
his
veins
,
and
generations
of
blood
*NL*
admixture
had
effaced
all
trace
of
his
negro
lineage
.
His
complexion
was
*NL*
blonde
,
his
eye
bright
and
piercing
,
his
lips
firm
and
well
moulded
;
his
*NL*
manner
very
affable
;
his
intellect
active
and
well
stored
with
*NL*
information
.
He
was
a
man
capable
of
winning
in
life
through
his
rich
*NL*
gifts
of
inheritance
and
acquirements
.
When
freedom
came
,
his
mother
,
*NL*
like
Hagar
of
old
,
went
out
into
the
wide
world
to
seek
a
living
for
*NL*
herself
and
child
.
Through
years
of
poverty
she
labored
to
educate
her
*NL*
child
,
and
saw
the
glad
fruition
of
her
hopes
when
her
son
graduated
as
*NL*
an
M.D.
from
the
University
of
P
--
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
his
graduation
he
met
his
father
's
mother
,
who
recognized
him
by
*NL*
his
resemblance
to
her
dear
,
departed
son
.
All
the
mother
love
in
her
*NL*
lonely
heart
awoke
,
and
she
was
willing
to
overlook
``
the
missing
link
of
*NL*
matrimony
,
''
and
adopt
him
as
her
heir
,
if
he
would
ignore
his
identity
*NL*
with
the
colored
race
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
him
loomed
all
the
possibilities
which
only
birth
and
blood
can
*NL*
give
a
white
man
in
our
Democratic
country
.
But
he
was
a
man
of
too
much
*NL*
sterling
worth
of
character
to
be
willing
to
forsake
his
mother
's
race
*NL*
for
the
richest
advantages
his
grandmother
could
bestow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Gresham
had
met
Dr.
Latimer
at
the
beginning
of
the
convention
,
and
*NL*
had
been
attracted
to
him
by
his
frank
and
genial
manner
.
One
morning
,
*NL*
when
conversing
with
him
,
Dr.
Gresham
had
learned
some
of
the
salient
*NL*
points
of
his
history
,
which
,
instead
of
repelling
him
,
had
only
*NL*
deepened
his
admiration
for
the
young
doctor
.
He
was
much
amused
when
he
*NL*
saw
the
pleasant
acquaintanceship
between
him
and
Dr.
Latrobe
,
but
they
*NL*
agreed
to
be
silent
about
his
racial
connection
until
the
time
came
when
*NL*
they
were
ready
to
divulge
it
;
and
they
were
hugely
delighted
at
his
*NL*
signal
blunder

not
well
,
''
said
Iola
to
Robert
.
``
I
spoke
to
her
about
sending
*NL*
for
a
doctor
,
but
she
objected
and
I
did
not
insist
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
ask
Dr.
Latimer
,
whom
I
met
at
the
Concordia
,
to
step
in
.
He
is
*NL*
a
splendid
young
fellow
.
I
wish
we
had
thousands
like
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
the
doctor
called
.
Without
appearing
to
make
a
*NL*
professional
visit
he
engaged
Marie
in
conversation
,
watched
her
*NL*
carefully
,
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
her
failing
health
proceeded
*NL*
more
from
mental
than
physical
causes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
so
uneasy
about
Harry
,
''
said
Mrs.
Leroy
.
``
He
is
so
fearless
and
*NL*
outspoken
.
I
do
wish
the
attention
of
the
whole
nation
could
be
turned
*NL*
to
the
cruel
barbarisms
which
are
a
national
disgrace
.
I
think
the
term
*NL*
`
bloody
shirt
'
is
one
of
the
most
heartless
phrases
ever
invented
to
*NL*
divert
attention
from
cruel
wrongs
and
dreadful
outrages
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Just
then
Iola
came
in
and
was
introduced
by
her
uncle
to
Dr.
Latimer
,
*NL*
to
whom
the
introduction
was
a
sudden
and
unexpected
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
an
interchange
of
courtesies
,
Marie
resumed
the
conversation
,
*NL*
saying
:
``
Harry
wrote
me
only
last
week
that
a
young
friend
of
his
had
*NL*
lost
his
situation
because
he
refused
to
have
his
pupils
strew
flowers
*NL*
on
the
streets
through
which
Jefferson
Davis
was
to
pass
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
,
''
said
Dr.
Latimer
,
indignantly
,
``
that
the
Israelites
had
just
*NL*
as
much
right
to
scatter
flowers
over
the
bodies
of
the
Egyptians
,
when
*NL*
the
waves
threw
back
their
corpses
on
the
shores
of
the
Red
Sea
,
as
*NL*
these
children
had
to
strew
the
path
of
Jefferson
Davis
with
flowers
.
We
*NL*
want
our
boys
to
grow
up
manly
citizens
,
and
not
cringing
sycophants
.
*NL*
When
do
you
expect
your
son
,
Mrs.
Leroy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
time
next
week
,
''
answered
Marie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
his
presence
will
do
you
more
good
than
all
the
medicine
in
my
*NL*
chest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
,
Doctor
,
''
said
Mrs.
Leroy
,
``
that
we
will
not
lose
sight
of
you
,
*NL*
now
that
your
professional
visit
is
ended
;
for
I
believe
your
visit
was
*NL*
the
result
of
a
conspiracy
between
Iola
and
her
uncle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Latimer
laughed
,
as
he
answered
,
``
Ah
,
Mrs.
Leroy
,
I
see
you
have
*NL*
found
us
all
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Doctor
,
''
exclaimed
Iola
,
with
pleasing
excitement
,
``
there
is
a
*NL*
young
lady
coming
here
to
visit
me
next
week
.
Her
name
is
Miss
Lucille
*NL*
Delany
,
and
she
is
my
ideal
woman
.
She
is
grand
,
brave
,
intellectual
,
*NL*
and
religious
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
so
?
She
would
make
some
man
an
excellent
wife
,
''
replied
Dr.
*NL*
Latimer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
is
n't
that
perfectly
manlike
,
''
answered
Iola
,
smiling
.
``
Mamma
,
what
*NL*
do
you
think
of
that
?
Did
any
of
you
gentlemen
ever
see
a
young
woman
of
*NL*
much
ability
that
you
did
not
look
upon
as
a
flotsam
all
adrift
until
*NL*
some
man
had
appropriated
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
,
Miss
Leroy
,
that
the
world
's
work
,
if
shared
,
is
better
done
*NL*
than
when
it
is
performed
alone
.
Do
n't
you
think
your
life-work
will
be
*NL*
better
done
if
some
one
shares
it
with
you
?
''
asked
Dr.
Latimer
,
slowly
,
*NL*
and
with
a
smile
in
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
would
depend
on
the
person
who
shared
it

said
Iola
,
faintly
*NL*
blushing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
''
said
Robert
,
a
few
evenings
after
this
conversation
,
as
he
*NL*
handed
Iola
a
couple
of
letters
,
``
is
something
which
will
please
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Iola
took
the
letters
,
and
,
after
reading
one
of
them
,
said
:
``
Miss
*NL*
Delany
and
Harry
will
be
here
on
Wednesday

and
this
one
is
an
*NL*
invitation

adds
to
my
enjoyment

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is

asked
Marie
;
``
an

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

something

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*

*NL*
``
I
am
glad

Iola
,
``

*NL*
something
for

been
longing

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

Iola

asked
Robert
,
``
do

good
time

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

yes

''
answered
Iola
,
seriously
,
``
I
believe
in
young
people
having

amusements

recreations

the
times
are

serious

*NL*
attempt
to
make
our
lives
a
long
holiday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Iola

answered
Robert
,
``
this
is
the
first
holiday
we
have
had
*NL*
in
two
hundred

fifty
years

and
you
should
n't
be
too
exacting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
replied
Marie
,
``
human
beings
naturally
crave
enjoyment
,
and
if
*NL*
not
furnished
with
good
amusements
they
are
apt
to
gravitate
to
low
*NL*
pleasures
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
one
,
''
said
Robert
,
``
has
said
that
the
Indian
belongs
to
an
old
*NL*
race
and
looks
gloomily
back
to
the
past
,
and
that
the
negro
belongs
to
*NL*
a
young
race
and
looks
hopefully
towards
the
future
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
that
be
so
,
''
replied
Marie
,
``
our
race-life
corresponds
more
to
the
*NL*
follies
of
youth
than
the
faults
of
maturer
years
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
Dr.
Latimer
's
next
visit
he
was
much
pleased
to
see
a
great
change
in
*NL*
Marie
's
appearance
.
Her
eye
had
grown
brighter
,
her
step
more
elastic
,
*NL*
and
the
anxiety
had
faded
from
her
face
.
Harry
had
arrived
,
and
with
him
*NL*
came
Miss
Delany
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
evening
,
Dr.
Latimer
,
''
said
Iola
,
cheerily
,
as
she
entered
the
*NL*
room
with
Miss
Lucille
Delany
.
``
This
is
my
friend
,
Miss
Delany
,
from
*NL*
Georgia

Were
she
not
present
I
would
say
she
is
one
of
the
grandest
*NL*
women
in
America

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
much
pleased
to
meet
you

said
Dr.
Latimer
,
cordially
;
``
I
*NL*
have
heard
Miss
Leroy
speak
of
you
.
We
were
expecting
you
,
''
he
added
,
*NL*
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
then
Harry
entered
the
room
,
and
Iola
presented
him
to
Dr.
Latimer
,
*NL*
saying
,
``
This
is
my
brother
,
about
whom
mamma
was
so
anxious
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Had
you
a
pleasant
journey
?
''
asked
Dr.
Latimer
,
after
the
first
*NL*
greetings
were
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
especially
,
''
answered
Miss
Delany
.
``
Southern
roads
are
not
always
*NL*
very
pleasant
to
travel

When
Mr.
Leroy
entered
the
cars
at
A

,
where
*NL*
he
was
known
,
had
he
taken
his
seat
among
the
white
people
he
would
have
*NL*
been
remanded
to
the
colored
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
after
awhile
,
''
said
Harry
,
``
as
Miss
Delany
and
myself
were
sitting
*NL*
together
,
laughing
and
chatting
,
a
colored
man
entered
the
car
,
and
,
*NL*
mistaking
me
for
a
white
man
,
asked
the
conductor
to
have
me
removed
,
*NL*
and
I
had
to
insist
that
I
was
colored
in
order
to
be
permitted
to
*NL*
remain
.
It
would
be
ludicrous
,
if
it
were
not
vexatious
,
to
be
too
white
*NL*
to
be
black
,
and
too
black
to
be
white

*NL*
*NL*
``
Caste
plays
such
fantastic
tricks
in
this
country

said
Dr.
Latimer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
Mr.
Leroy
,
''
said
Miss
Delany
,
``
that
when
he
returns
he
must
put

a
label
on
himself

CHAPTER
XXX
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
FRIENDS
IN
COUNCIL
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
following
Friday
evening
,
Mr.
Stillman
's
pleasant
,
spacious
*NL*
parlors
were
filled
to
overflowing
with
a
select
company
of
earnest
men
*NL*
and
women
deeply
interested
in
the
welfare
of
the
race
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bishop
Tunster
had
prepared
a
paper
on
``
Negro
Emigration
.
''
Dr.
Latimer
*NL*
opened
the
discussion
by
speaking
favorably
of
some
of
the
salient
*NL*
points
,
but
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
believe
self-exilement
is
the
true
remedy
for
the
wrongs
of
*NL*
the
negro
.
Where
should
he
go
if
he
left
this
country
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
to
Africa
,
''
replied
Bishop
Tunster
,
in
his
bluff
,
hearty
tones
.
``
I
*NL*
believe
that
Africa
is
to
be
redeemed
to
civilization
,
and
that
the
*NL*
negro
is
to
be
gathered
into
the
family
of
nations
and
recognized
as
a
*NL*
man
and
a
brother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
to
Africa
?
''
repeated
Professor
Langhorne
,
of
Georgia
.
``
Does
the
*NL*
United
States
own
one
foot
of
African
soil
?
And
have
we
not
been
*NL*
investing
our
blood
in
the
country
for
ages
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
in
favor
of
missionary
efforts
,
''
said
Professor
Gradnor
,
of
North
*NL*
Carolina
,
``
for
the
redemption
of
Africa
,
but
I
see
no
reason
for
*NL*
expatriating
ourselves
because
some
persons
do
not
admire
the
color
of
*NL*
our
skins
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
believe
,
''
said
Mr.
Stillman
,
``
in
emptying
on
the
shores
of
*NL*
Africa
a
horde
of
ignorant
,
poverty-stricken
people
,
as
missionaries
of
*NL*
civilization
or
Christianity
.
And
while
I
am
in
favor
of
missionary
*NL*
efforts
,
there
is
need
here
for
the
best
heart
and
brain
to
work
in
*NL*
unison
for
justice
and
righteousness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
America
,
''
said
Miss
Delany
,
``
is
the
best
field
for
human
development
.
*NL*
God
has
not
heaped
up
our
mountains
with
such
grandeur
,
flooded
our
*NL*
rivers
with
such
majesty
,
crowned
our
valleys
with
such
fertility
,
*NL*
enriched
our
mines
with
such
wealth
,
that
they
should
only
minister
to
*NL*
grasping
greed
and
sensuous
enjoyment

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Climate
,
soil
,
and
physical
environments
,
''
said
Professor
Gradnor
,
*NL*
``
have
much
to
do
with
shaping
national
characteristics
.
If
in
Africa
,
*NL*
under
a
tropical
sun
,
the
negro
has
lagged
behind
other
races
in
the
*NL*
march
of
civilization
,
at
least
for
once
in
his
history
he
has
,
in
this
*NL*
country
,
the
privilege
of
using
climatic
advantages
and
developing
under
*NL*
new
conditions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
replied
Dr.
Latimer
,
``
and
I
do
not
wish
our
people
to
become
*NL*
restless
and
unsettled
before
they
have
tried
one
generation
of
*NL*
freedom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
always
glad
,
''
said
Mr.
Forest
,
a
tall
,
distinguished-looking
*NL*
gentleman
from
New
York
,
``
when
I
hear
of
people
who
are
ill
treated
in
*NL*
one
section
of
the
country
emigrating
to
another
.
Men
who
are
deaf
to
*NL*
the
claims
of
mercy
,
and
oblivious
to
the
demands
of
justice
,
can
feel
*NL*
when
money
is
slipping
from
their
pockets
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
negro
,
''
said
Hon.
Dugdale
,
``
does
not
present
to
my
mind
the
picture
*NL*
of
an
effete
and
exhausted
people
,
destined
to
die
out
before
a
stronger
*NL*
race
.
Gilbert
Haven
once
saw
a
statue
which
suggested
this
thought
,
'
I
*NL*
am
black
,
but
comely
;
the
sun
has
looked
down
upon
me
,
but
I
will
teach
*NL*
you
who
despise
me
to
feel
that
I
am
your
superior
.
'
The
men
who
are
*NL*
acquiring
property
and
building
up
homes
in
the
South
show
us
what
*NL*
energy
and
determination
may
do
even
in
that
part
of
the
country
.
I
*NL*
believe
such
men
can
do
more
to
conquer
prejudice
than
if
they
spent
all
*NL*
their
lives
in
shouting
for
their
rights
and
ignoring
their
duties
.
No
!
*NL*
as
there
are
millions
of
us
in
this
country
,
I
think
it
best
to
settle
*NL*
down
and
work
out
our
own
salvation
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
many
of
us
to-day
,
''
asked
Professor
Langhorne
,
``
would
be
teaching
*NL*
in
the
South
,
if
every
field
of
labor
in
the
North
was
as
accessible
to
*NL*
us
as
to
the
whites
?
It
has
been
estimated
that
a
million
young
white
*NL*
men
have
left
the
South
since
the
war
,
and
,
had
our
chances
been
equal
*NL*
to
theirs
,
would
we
have
been
any
more
willing
to
stay
in
the
South
with
*NL*
those
who
need
us
than
they
?
But
this
prejudice
,
by
impacting
us
*NL*
together
,
gives
us
a
common
cause
and
brings
our
intellect
in
contact
*NL*
with
the
less
favored
of
our
race
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
believe
,
''
said
Miss
Delany
,
``
that
the
Southern
white
people
*NL*

any

It

be
suicidal
to
attempt

expatriation

*NL*
``
History
,
''
said
Professor
Langhorne
,
``
tells
that
Spain
was
once
the
*NL*
place
where
barbarian
Europe
came
to
light
her
lamp
.
Seven
hundred
years
*NL*
before
there
was
a
public
lamp
in
London
you
might
have
gone
through
the
*NL*
streets
of
Cordova
amid
ten
miles
of
lighted
lamps
,
and
stood
there
on
*NL*
solidly
paved
land
,
when
hundreds
of
years
afterwards
,
in
Paris
,
on
a
*NL*
rainy
day
you
would
have
sunk
to
your
ankles
in
the
mud
.
But
she
who
*NL*
bore
the
name
of
the
`
Terror
of
Nations
,
'
and
the
`
Queen
of
the
Ocean
,
'
*NL*
was
not
strong
enough
to
dash
herself
against
God
's
law
of
retribution
*NL*
and
escape
unscathed
.
She
inaugurated
a
crusade
of
horror
against
a
*NL*
million
of
her
best
laborers
and
artisans
.
Vainly
she
expected
the
*NL*
blessing
of
God
to
crown
her
work
of
violence
.
Instead
of
seeing
the
*NL*
fruition
of
her
hopes
in
the
increased
prosperity
of
her
land
,
*NL*
depression
and
paralysis
settled
on
her
trade
and
business
.
A
fearful
*NL*
blow
was
struck
at
her
agriculture
;
decay
settled
on
her
manufactories
;
*NL*
money
became
too
scarce
to
pay
the
necessary
expenses
of
the
king
's
*NL*
exchequer
;
and
that
once
mighty
empire
became
a
fallen
kingdom
,
pierced
*NL*
by
her
crimes
and
dragged
down
by
her
transgressions
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
We
did
not

Iola

beyond

shadows
I

see
the
coruscation

we
can
help
usher
it
in

not

by
answering
hate

hate
,
or
giving
scorn
for
scorn
,
but
by
striving
*NL*
to
be
more
generous
,
noble
,
and
just
.
It
seems
as

The
next
paper
was
on
``
Patriotism
,
''
by
Rev.
Cantnor
.
It
was
a
paper
in
*NL*
which
the
white
man
was
extolled
as
the
master
race
,
and
spoke
as
if
it
*NL*
were
a
privilege
for
the
colored
man
to
be
linked
to
his
destiny
and
to
*NL*
live
beneath
the
shadow
of
his
power
.
He
asserted
that
the
white
race
of
*NL*
this
country
is
the
broadest
,
most
Christian
,
and
humane
of
that
branch
*NL*
of
the
human
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Latimer
took
exception
to
his
position
.
``
Law
,
''
he
said
,
``
is
the
*NL*
pivot
on
which
the
whole
universe
turns
;
and
obedience
to
law
is
the
*NL*
gauge
by
which
a
nation
's
strength
or
weakness
is
tried
.
We
have
had
two
*NL*
evils
by
which
our
obedience
to
law
has
been
tested
--
slavery
and
the
*NL*
liquor
traffic
.
How
have
we
dealt
with
them
both
?
We
have
been
weighed
*NL*
in
the
balance
and
found
wanting
.
Millions
of
slaves
and
serfs
have
been
*NL*
liberated
during
this
century
,
but
not
even
in
semi-barbaric
Russia
,
*NL*
heathen
Japan
,
or
Catholic
Spain
has
slavery
been
abolished
through
such
*NL*
a
fearful
conflict
as
it
was
in
the
United
States
.
The
liquor
traffic
*NL*
still
sends
its
floods
of
ruin
and
shame
to
the
habitations
of
men
,
and
*NL*
no
political
party
has
been
found
with
enough
moral
power
and
numerical
*NL*
strength
to
stay
the
tide
of
death
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
,
''
said
Professor
Gradnor
,
``
that
what
our
country
needs
is
truth
*NL*
more
than
flattery
.
I
do
not
think
that
our
moral
life
keeps
pace
with
*NL*
our
mental
development
and
material
progress
.
I
know
of
no
civilized
*NL*
country
on
the
globe
,
Catholic
,
Protestant
,
or
Mohammedan
,
where
life
is
*NL*
less
secure
than
it
is
in
the
South
.
Nearly
eighteen
hundred
years
ago
*NL*
the
life
of
a
Roman
citizen
in
Palestine
was
in
danger
from
mob
*NL*
violence
.
That
pagan
government
threw
around
him
a
wall
of
living
clay
,
*NL*
consisting
of
four
hundred
and
seventy
men
,
when
more
than
forty
Jews
*NL*
had
bound
themselves
with
an
oath
that
they
would
neither
eat
nor
drink
*NL*
until
they
had
taken
the
life
of
the
Apostle
Paul
.
Does
not
true
*NL*
patriotism
demand
that
citizenship
should
be
as
much
protected
in
*NL*
Christian
America
as
it
was
in
heathen
Rome
?

*NL*
``
I

said
Miss

Instead
of
forgetting
the

,
I
would
have
them
hold
in

everlasting
remembrance
our
great
deliverance
.
Hitherto
we
have
never

tender

precious

to
fill
our

with
*NL*
tears
,
or
glad
reminiscences
to
thrill
our

with
pride

We

that

walk

Pain
and

suffering
are
the
crucibles
out
of
which
come
gold
more
fine
than
the
*NL*
pavements
of
heaven
,
and
gems
more
precious
than

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
,
''
said
Mrs.
Leroy
,
``
pain
and
suffering
are
factors
in
human

development

surely
we
have
not
been
counted
too
worthless
to
suffer

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
is
there
,
''
continued
Iola
,
``
a
path
which
we
have
trodden
in
this
*NL*
country
,
unless
it
be
the
path
of
sin
,
into
which
Jesus
Christ
has
not
*NL*
put
His
feet
and
left
it
luminous
with
the
light
of
His
steps
?
Has
the
*NL*
negro
been
poor
and
homeless
?
The
birds
of
the
air
had
nests
and
the
*NL*
foxes
had
holes
,
but
the
Son
of
man
had
not
where
to
lay
His
head
.
Has
*NL*
our
name
been
a
synonym
for
contempt
?
`
He
shall
be
called
a
Nazarene
.
'
*NL*
Have
we
been
despised
and
trodden
under
foot
?
Christ
was
despised
and
*NL*
rejected
of
men
.
Have
we
been
ignorant
and
unlearned
?
It
was
said
of
*NL*
Jesus
Christ
,
`
How
knoweth
this
man
letters
,
never
having
learned
?
'
Have
*NL*
we
been
beaten
and
bruised
in
the
prison-house
of
bondage
?
`
They
took
*NL*
Jesus
and
scourged
Him
.
'
Have
we
been
slaughtered
,
our
bones
scattered
*NL*
at
the
graves
'
mouth
?
He
was
spit
upon
by
the
mob
,
smitten
and
mocked
by
*NL*
the
rabble
,
and
died
as
died
Rome
's
meanest
criminal
slave
.
To-day
that
*NL*
cross
of
shame
is
a
throne
of
power
.
Those
robes
of
scorn
have
changed
*NL*
to
habiliments
of
light
,
and
that
crown
of
mockery
to
a
diadem
of
glory
.
*NL*
And
never
,
while
the
agony
of
Gethsemane
and
the
sufferings
of
Calvary
*NL*
have
their
hold
upon
my
heart
,
will
I
recognize
any
religion
as
His
*NL*
which
despises
the
least
of
His
brethren
.

*NL*
As
Iola
finished
,
there
was
a
ring
of
triumph
in
her
voice
,
as
if
she
*NL*
were
reviewing
a
path
she
had
trodden
with
bleeding
feet
,
and
seen
it
*NL*
change
to
lines
of
living
light
.
Her
soul
seemed
to
be
flashing
through
*NL*
the
rare
loveliness
of
her
face
and
etherealizing
its
beauty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
one
was
spell-bound
.
Dr.
Latimer
was
entranced
,
and
,
turning
to
*NL*
Hon.
Dugdale
,
said
,
in
a
low
voice
and
with
deep-drawn
breath
,
``
She

*NL*
*NL*
Hon.
Dugdale
turned

gave
a

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

I
have
met

I
accompanied

The

voice
are
like
benedictions

her

a
call
to
*NL*
higher
service

Just
then
Rev.

He

*NL*
*NL*
``

and
refreshment
;
but
if
the
courtesy
failed
on
my

it
*NL*
did
not
fail
in

I
wanted

won
distinction
before

*NL*
``
My

Rev.
Carmicle
,
smiling
,
``
some
of
these

look
on

You

the

gone
forth

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Of

said
Rev.

,
``

am
pleased
*NL*
to
see
doors
open
to
you

were
closed

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How

''
asked
Hon.
Dugdale
,
``
do
you
feel
in
reference
to
our
people

*NL*
condition
in
the
South
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
hopeful
,
although
at
times
I
can
not
help
feeling
anxious
about
*NL*
their
future
.
I
was
delighted
with
my
visits
to
various
institutions
of
*NL*
learning
,
and
surprised
at
the
desire
manifested
among
the
young
people
*NL*
to
obtain
an
education
.
Where
toil-worn
mothers
bent
beneath
their
heavy
*NL*
burdens
their
more
favored
daughters
are
enjoying
the
privileges
of
*NL*
education
.
Young
people
are
making
recitations
in
Greek
and
Latin
where
*NL*
it
was
once
a
crime
to
teach
their
parents
to
read
.
I
also
became
*NL*
acquainted
with
colored
professors
and
presidents
of
colleges
.
Saw
young
*NL*
ladies
who
had
graduated
as
doctors
.
Comfortable
homes
have
succeeded
*NL*
old
cabins
of
slavery
.
Vast
crops
have
been
raised
by
free
labor
.
I
read
*NL*
with
interest
and
pleasure
a
number
of
papers
edited
by
colored
men
.
I
*NL*
saw
it
estimated
that
two
millions
of
our
people
had
learned
to
read
,
*NL*
and
I
feel
deeply
grateful
to
the
people
who
have
supplied
us
with
*NL*
teachers
who
have
stood
their
ground
so
nobly
among
our
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
asked
Mr.
Forest
,
``
you
expressed
fears
about
the
future
of
our
*NL*
race
.
From
whence
do
your
fears
arise
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
the
unfortunate
conditions
which
slavery
has
entailed
upon
that
*NL*
section
of
our
country
.
I
dread
the
results
of
that
racial
feeling
which
*NL*
ever
and
anon
breaks
out
into
restlessness
and
crime
.
Also
,
I
am
*NL*
concerned
about
the
lack
of
home
training
for
those
for
whom
the
*NL*
discipline
of
the
plantation
has
been
exchanged
for
the
penalties
of
*NL*
prisons
and
chain-gangs
.
I
am
sorry
to
see
numbers
of
our
young
men
*NL*
growing
away
from
the
influence
of
the
church
and
drifting
into
prisons
.
*NL*
I
also
fear
that
in
some
sections
,
as
colored
men
increase
in
wealth
and
*NL*
intelligence
,
there
will
be
an
increase
of
race
rivalry
and
jealousy
.
It
*NL*
is
said
that
savages
,
by
putting
their
ears
to
the
ground
,
can
hear
a
*NL*
far-off
tread
.
So
,
to-day
,
I
fear
that
there
are
savage
elements
in
our
*NL*
civilization
which
hear
the
advancing
tread
of
the
negro
and
would
*NL*
retard
his
coming
.
It
is
the
incarnation
of
these
elements
that
I
dread
.
*NL*
It
is
their
elimination
I
do
so
earnestly
desire
.
Whether
it
be
outgrown
*NL*
or
not
is
our
unsolved
problem
.
Time
alone
will
tell
whether
or
not
the
*NL*
virus
of
slavery
and
injustice
has
too
fully
permeated
our
Southern
*NL*
civilization
for
a
complete
recovery
.
Nations
,
honey-combed
by
vice
,
*NL*
have
fallen
beneath
the
weight
of
their
iniquities
.
Justice
is
always
*NL*
uncompromising
in
its
claims
and
inexorable
in
its
demands
.
The
laws
of
*NL*
the
universe
are
never
repealed
to
accommodate
our
follies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
,
''
said
Bishop
Tunster
,
``
the
negro
has
a
higher
mission
than
that
*NL*
of
aimlessly
drifting
through
life
and
patiently
waiting
for
death
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
may
not
,
''
answered
Rev.
Carmicle
,
``
have
the
same
dash
,
courage
,
and
*NL*
aggressiveness
of
other
races
,
accustomed
to
struggle
,
achievement
,
and
*NL*
dominion
,
but
surely
the
world
needs
something
better
than
the
results
*NL*
of
arrogance
,
aggressiveness
,
and
indomitable
power
.
For
the
evils
of
*NL*
society
there
are
no
solvents
as
potent
as
love
and
justice
,
and
our
*NL*
greatest
need
is
not
more
wealth
and
learning
,
but
a
religion
replete
*NL*
with
life
and
glowing
with
love
.
Let
this
be
the
impelling
force
in
the
*NL*
race
and
it
can
not
fail
to
rise
in
the
scale
of
character
and
*NL*
condition
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
,
''
said
Dr.
Latimer
,
``
instead
of
narrowing
our
sympathies
to
mere
*NL*
racial
questions

let
us
broaden
them
to
humanity
's
wider
issues

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let

,
''
replied
Rev.
Carmicle
,
``
pass
it
along
the
lines
,
that

be
*NL*
willfully
ignorant
is
to
be
shamefully
criminal

Let

teach
our
people
*NL*
not
to
love
pleasure
or
to
fear
death
,
but
to
learn
the
true
value
of

life

and
to
do
their
part
to
eliminate
the
paganism
of
caste
from
our
*NL*
holy
religion
and
the
lawlessness
of
savagery
from

I
know
her
and
admire
her
;
and
she
ought
to
be
made
the
subject
*NL*
of
a
soul-inspiring
story
.
Do
you
know
of
whom
I
speak
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
should
I
,
Doctor
?
I
am
sure
you
have
not
made
me
your
confidante
,
''
*NL*
she
responded
,
demurely
;
then
she
quickly
turned
and
tripped
up
the
*NL*
steps
of
her
home
,
which
she
had
just
reached
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
conversation
Dr.
Latimer
became
a
frequent
visitor
at
Iola
's
*NL*
home
,
and
a
firm
friend
of
her
brother
.
Harry
was
at
that
age
when
,
for
*NL*
the
young
and
inexperienced
,
vice
puts
on
her
fairest
guise
and
most
*NL*
seductive
smiles
.
Dr.
Latimer
's
wider
knowledge
and
larger
experience
*NL*
made
his
friendship
for
Harry
very
valuable
,
and
the
service
he
rendered
*NL*
him
made
him
a
favorite
and
ever-welcome
guest
in
the
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
all
alone
,
''
asked
Robert
,
one
night
,
as
he
entered
the
cosy
*NL*
little
parlor
where
Iola
sat
reading
.
``
Where
are
the
rest
of
the
folks
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma
and
grandma
have
gone
to
bed
,
''
answered
Iola
.
``
Harry
and
Lucille
*NL*
are
at
the
concert
.
They
are
passionately
fond
of
music
,
and
find
*NL*
facilities
here
that
they
do
not
have
in
the
South
.
They
would
n't
go
to
*NL*
hear
a
seraph
where
they
must
take
a
negro
seat
.
I
was
too
tired
to
go
.
*NL*
Besides
,
`
two
's
company
and
three
's
a
crowd
,
'
''
she
added
,
significantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
reckon
you
struck
the
nail
on
the
head
that
time
,
''
said
Robert
,
*NL*
laughing
.
``
But
you
have
not
been
alone
all
the
time
.
Just
as
I
reached
*NL*
the
corner
I
saw
Dr.
Latimer
leaving
the
door
.
I
see
he
still
continues
*NL*
his
visits
.
Who
is
his
patient
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Uncle
Robert
,
''
said
Iola
,
smiling
and
flushing
,
``
he
is
out
with
*NL*
Harry
and
Lucille
part
of
the
time
,
and
drops
in
now
and
then
to
see
us
*NL*
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Robert
,
``
I
suppose
the
case
is
now
an
affair
of
the
heart
.
*NL*
But
I
can
not
blame
him
for
it
,
''
he
added
,
looking
fondly
on
the
*NL*
beautiful
face
of
his
niece
,
which
sorrow
had
touched
only
to
chisel
*NL*
into
more
loveliness
.
``
How
do
you
like
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
have
within
me
,
''
answered
Iola
,
with
unaffected
truthfulness
,
``
a
*NL*
large
amount
of
hero
worship
.
The
characters
of
the
Old
Testament
I
most
*NL*
admire
are
Moses
and
Nehemiah
.
They
were
willing
to
put
aside
their
own
*NL*
advantages
for
their
race
and
country
.
Dr.
Latimer
comes
up
to
my
ideal
*NL*
of
a
high
,
heroic
manhood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
,
''
answered
Robert
,
smiling
archly
,
``
he
would
be
delighted
to
*NL*
hear
your
opinion
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
him
,
''
continued
Iola
,
``
that
he
belongs
to
the
days
of
chivalry
.
*NL*
But
he
smiles
and
says
,
`
he
only
belongs
to
the
days
of
hard-pan
*NL*
service
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
one
,
''
said
Robert
,
``
was
saying
to-day
that
he
stood
in
his
own
*NL*
light
when
he
refused
his
grandmother
's
offer
to
receive
him
as
her
*NL*
son
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
,
''
said
Iola
,
``
it
was
the
grandest
hour
of
his
life
when
he
made
*NL*
that
decision
.
I
have
admired
him
ever
since
I
heard
his
story
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Iola
,
think
of
the
advantages
he
set
aside
.
It
was
no
sacrifice
*NL*
for
me
to
remain
colored
,
with
my
lack
of
education
and
race
sympathies
,
*NL*
but
Dr.
Latimer
had
doors
open
to
him
as
a
white
man
which
are
forever
*NL*
closed
to
a
colored
man
.
To
be
born
white
in
this
country
is
to
be
born
*NL*
to
an
inheritance
of
privileges
,
to
hold
in
your
hands
the
keys
that
*NL*
open
before
you
the
doors
of
every
occupation
,
advantage
,
opportunity
,
*NL*
and
achievement
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
that
,
uncle
,
''
answered
Iola
;
``
but
even
these
advantages
are
too
*NL*
dearly
bought
if
they
mean
loss
of
honor
,
true
manliness
,
and
self
*NL*
respect
.
He
could
not
have
retained
these
had
he
ignored
his
mother
and
*NL*
lived
under
a
veil
of
concealment
,
constantly
haunted
by
a
dread
of
*NL*
detection
.
The
gain
would
not
have
been
worth
the
cost
.
It
were
better
*NL*
that
he
should
walk
the
ruggedest
paths
of
life
a
true
man
than
tread
*NL*
the
softest
carpets
a
moral
cripple
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
,
''
said
Robert
,
laying
his
hand
caressingly
upon
her
head
,
*NL*
``
that
we
are
destined
to
lose
the
light
of
our
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
uncle
,
how
you
talk
!
I
never
dreamed
of
what
you
are
thinking

*NL*
answered
Iola
,
half
reproachfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
,
''
asked
Robert
,
``
do
you
know
what
I
am
thinking
about

*NL*
*NL*
``
My

uncle

I
'm
not
blind

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Neither
am
I
,
''
replied
Robert
,
significantly
,
as
he
left
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Iola
's
admiration
for
Dr.
Latimer
was
not
a
one-sided
affair
.
Day
after
*NL*
day
she
was
filling
a
larger
place
in
his
heart
.
The
touch
of
her
hand
*NL*
thrilled
him
with
emotion
.
Her
lightest
words
were
an
entrancing
melody
*NL*
to
his
ear
.
Her
noblest
sentiments
found
a
response
in
his
heart
.
In
*NL*
their
desire
to
help
the
race
their
hearts
beat
in
loving
unison
.
One
*NL*
grand
and
noble
purpose
was
giving
tone
and
color
to
their
lives
and
*NL*
strengthening
the
bonds
of
affection
between
them

CHAPTER
XXXII
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
WOOING
AND
WEDDING
.
*NL*
*NL*
Harry
's
vacation
had
been
very
pleasant
.
Miss
Delany
,
with
her
fine
*NL*
conversational
powers
and
ready
wit
,
had
added
much
to
his
enjoyment
.
*NL*
Robert
had
given
his
mother
the
pleasantest
room
in
the
house
,
and
in
*NL*
the
evening
the
family
would
gather
around
her
,
tell
her
the
news
of
the
*NL*
day
,
read
to
her
from
the
Bible
,
join
with
her
in
thanksgiving
for
*NL*
mercies
received
and
in
prayer
for
protection
through
the
night
.
Harry
*NL*
was
very
grateful
to
Dr.
Latimer
for
the
kindly
interest
he
had
shown
in
*NL*
accompanying
Miss
Delany
and
himself
to
places
of
interest
and
*NL*
amusement
.
He
was
grateful
,
too
,
that
in
the
city
of
P
--
doors
were
*NL*
open
to
them
which
were
barred
against
them
in
the
South
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bright
,
beautiful
days
of
summer
were
gliding
into
autumn
,
with
its
*NL*
glorious
wealth
of
foliage
,
and
the
time
was
approaching
for
the
*NL*
departure
of
Harry
and
Miss
Delany
to
their
respective
schools
,
when
Dr.
*NL*
Latimer
received
several
letters
from
North
Carolina
,
urging
him
to
come
*NL*
South
,
as
physicians
were
greatly
needed
there
.
Although
his
practice
*NL*
was
lucrative
in
the
city
of
P
--
,
he
resolved
he
would
go
where
his
*NL*
services
were
most
needed
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
evenings
before
he
started
he
called
at
the
house
,
and
made
an
*NL*
engagement
to
drive
Iola
to
the
park
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
time
appointed
he
drove
up
to
the
door
in
his
fine
equipage
.
*NL*
Iola
stepped
gracefully
in
and
sat
quietly
by
his
side
to
enjoy
the
*NL*
loveliness
of
the
scenery
and
the
gorgeous
grandeur
of
the
setting
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
expect
to
go
South
,
''
said
Dr.
Latimer
,
as
he
drove
slowly
along
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
indeed
,
''
said
Iola
,
assuming
an
air
of
interest
,
while
a
shadow
*NL*
flitted
over
her
face
.
``
Where
do
you
expect
to
pitch
your
tent
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
city
of
C
--
,
North
Carolina
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
wish
,
''
she
exclaimed
,
``
that
you
were
going
to
Georgia
,
where
you
*NL*
could
take
care
of
that
high-spirited
brother
of
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
if
he
were
to
hear
you
he
would
laugh
,
and
say
that
he
could
*NL*
take
care
of
himself
.
But
I
know
a
better
plan
than
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
asked
Iola
,
innocently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
you
will
commit
yourself
,
instead
of
your
brother
,
to
my
care
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dear
,
''
replied
Iola
,
drawing
a
long
breath
.
``
What
would
mamma
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
she
would
willingly
resign
you
,
I
hope
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
would
grandma
and
Uncle
Robert
say
?
''
again
asked
Iola
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
they
would
cheerfully
acquiesce
.
Now
,
what
would
I
say
if
they
all
*NL*
consent
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
modestly
responded
Iola
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
replied
Dr.
Latimer
,
``
I
would
say
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Could
deeds
my
love
discover
,
*NL*
Could
valor
gain
thy
charms
,
*NL*
To
prove
myself
thy
lover
*NL*
I
'd
face
a
world
in
arms
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
prove
a
good
soldier
,
''
added
Iola
,
smiling
,
``
when
there
is
no
*NL*
battle
to
fight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Iola
,
I
am
in
earnest
,
''
said
Dr.
Latimer
,
passionately
.
``
In
the
work
to
*NL*
which
I
am
devoted
every
burden
will
be
lighter
,
every
path
smoother
,
if
*NL*
brightened
and
blessed
with
your
companionship
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
sober
expression
swept
over
Iola
's
face
,
and
,
dropping
her
eyes
,
she
*NL*
said
:
``
I
must
have
time
to
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Quietly
they
rode
along
the
river
bank
until
Dr.
Latimer
broke
the
*NL*
silence
by
saying
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Iola
,
I
think
that
you
brood
too
much
over
the
condition
of
our
*NL*
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
I
do
,
''
she
replied
,
``
but
they
never
burn
a
man
in
the
South
*NL*
that
they
do
not
kindle
a
fire
around
my
soul

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
,
''
replied
Dr.
Latimer
,
``
that
you
will
grow
morbid
and
*NL*
nervous

Most
of
our
people
take
life
easily

why
should
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because

she
answered
,
``
I
can
see
breakers
ahead
which
they
do
not

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
give
yourself
no
uneasiness
.
They
will
catch
the
fret
and
fever
of
*NL*
the
nineteenth
century
soon
enough
.
I
have
heard
several
of
our
*NL*
ministers
say
that
it
is
chiefly
men
of
disreputable
characters
who
are
*NL*
made
the
subjects
of
violence
and
lynch-law

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Suppose
it
is
so
,
''
responded
Iola
,
feelingly
.
``
If
these
men
believe
in
*NL*
eternal
punishment
they
ought
to
feel
a
greater
concern
for
the
wretched
*NL*
sinner
who
is
hurried
out
of
time
with
all
his
sins
upon

passes
through
violence

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true

I

had

Iola

share
my
lot
,
I
am
*NL*
not
inviting
you
to
a
life
of
ease
and
luxury
,
for
year
after
year
I
may
*NL*
have
to
struggle
to
keep
the
wolf
from
the
door
,
but
your
presence
would
*NL*
make
my
home
one
of
the
brightest
spots
on
earth
,
and
one
of
the
fairest
*NL*
types
of
heaven
.
Am
I
presumptuous
in
hoping
that
your
love
will
become
*NL*
the
crowning
joy
of
my
life
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
words
were
more
than
a
tender
strain
wooing
her
to
love
and
*NL*
happiness
,
they
were
a
clarion
call
to
a
life
of
high
and
holy
worth
,
a
*NL*
call
which
found
a
response
in
her
heart
.
Her
hand
lay
limp
in
his
.
She
*NL*
did
not
withdraw
it
,
but
,
raising
her
lustrous
eyes
to
his
,
she
softly
*NL*
answered
:
``
Frank
,
I
love
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
he
had
gone
,
Iola
sat
by
the
window
,
gazing
at
the
splendid
stars
,
*NL*
her
heart
quietly
throbbing
with
a
delicious
sense
of
joy
and
love
.
She
*NL*
had
admired
Dr.
Gresham
and
,
had
there
been
no
barrier
in
her
way
,
she
*NL*
might
have
learned
to
love
him
;
but
Dr.
Latimer
had
grown
irresistibly
*NL*
upon
her
heart
.
There
were
depths
in
her
nature
that
Dr.
Gresham
had
*NL*
never
fathomed
;
aspirations
in
her
soul
with
which
he
had
never
mingled
.
*NL*
But
as
the
waves
leap
up
to
the
strand
,
so
her
soul
went
out
to
Dr.
*NL*
Latimer
.
Between
their
lives
were
no
impeding
barriers
,
no
inclination
*NL*
impelling
one
way
and
duty
compelling
another
.
Kindred
hopes
and
tastes
*NL*
had
knit
their
hearts
;
grand
and
noble
purposes
were
lighting
up
their
*NL*
lives
;
and
they
esteemed
it
a
blessed
privilege
to
stand
on
the
*NL*
threshold
of
a
new
era
and
labor
for
those
who
had
passed
from
the
old
*NL*
oligarchy
of
slavery
into
the
new
commonwealth
of
freedom
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
next
evening
,
Dr.
Latimer
rang
the
bell
and
was
answered
by
*NL*
Harry
,
who
ushered
him
into
the
parlor
,
and
then
came
back
to
the
*NL*
sitting-room
,
saying
,
``
Iola
,
Dr.
Latimer
has
called
to
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
he
?
''
answered
Iola
,
a
glad
light
coming
into
her
eyes
.
``
Come
,
*NL*
Lucille
,
let
us
go
into
the
parlor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
''
interposed
Harry
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
catching
*NL*
Lucille
's
hand
.
``
He
did
n't
ask
for
you
.
When
we
went
to
the
concert
we
*NL*
were
told
three
's
a
crowd
.
And
I
say
one
good
turn
deserves
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Harry
,
you
are
so
full
of
nonsense
.
Let
Lucille
go
!
''
said
Iola
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
I
will
not
.
I
want
to
have
a
good
time
as
well
as
you
,
''
said
*NL*
Harry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
're
the
most
nonsensical
man
I
know
,
''
interposed
Miss
Delany
.
*NL*
Yet
she
stayed
with
Harry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
looking
very
bright
and
happy
,
''
said
Dr.
Latimer
to
Iola
,
as
she
*NL*
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
ride
in
the
park
was
so
refreshing
!
I
enjoyed
it
so
much
!
The
day
*NL*
was
so
lovely
,
the
air
delicious
,
the
birds
sang
so
sweetly
,
and
the
*NL*
sunset
was
so
magnificent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
of
it
.
Why
,
Iola
,
your
home
is
so
happy
your
heart
should
be
*NL*
as
light
as
a
school-girl
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doctor
,
''
she
replied
,
``
I
must
be
prematurely
old
.
I
have
scarcely
known
*NL*
what
it
is
to
be
light-hearted
since
my
father
's
death
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it
,
darling
,
''
he
answered
,
seating
himself
beside
her
,
and
*NL*
drawing
her
to
him
.
``
You
have
been
tried
in
the
fire
,
but
are
you
not
*NL*
better
for
the
crucial
test
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doctor
,
''
she
replied
,
``
as
we
rode
along
yesterday
,
mingling
with
the
*NL*
sunshine
of
the
present
came
the
shadows
of
the
past
.
I
was
thinking
of
*NL*
the
bright
,
joyous
days
of
my
girlhood
,
when
I
defended
slavery
,
and
of
*NL*
how
the
cup
that
I
would
have
pressed
to
the
lips
of
others
was
forced
*NL*
to
my
own
.
Yet
,
in
looking
over
the
mournful
past
,
I
would
not
change
*NL*
the
Iola
of
then
for
the
Iola
of
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
responded
Dr.
Latimer
,
musingly
,
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Darkness
shows
us
worlds
of
light
*NL*
We
never
saw
by
day

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Doctor
,
you
can
not
conceive
what
it
must
have
been
to
be
hurled
*NL*
from
a
home
of
love
and
light
into
the
dark
abyss
of
slavery
;
to
be
*NL*
compelled
to
take
your
place
among
a
people
you
have
learned
to
look
*NL*
upon
as
inferiors
and
social
outcasts
;
to
be
in
the
power
of
men
whose
*NL*
presence
would
fill
you
with
horror
and
loathing
,
and
to
know
that
there
*NL*
is
no
earthly
power
to
protect
you
from
the
highest
insults
which
brutal
*NL*
cowardice
could
shower
upon
you

I
am
so
glad
that
no
other
woman
of
my
*NL*
race
will
suffer
as
I
have
done
.

*NL*
*NL*
The
flush
deepened
on
her
face
,
a
mournful
splendor
beamed
from
her
*NL*
beautiful
eyes
,
into
which
the
tears
had
slowly
gathered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Darling
,
''
he
said
,
his
voice
vibrating
with
mingled
feelings
of
*NL*
tenderness
and
resentment
,
``
you
must
forget
the
sad
past

You
are
like
a
*NL*
tender
lamb
snatched
from
the
jaws
of
a
hungry
wolf

who
still
needs
*NL*
protecting

But
it
must
have
been
terrible

he
added
,
in
a
*NL*
painful
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
indeed

For
awhile
I
was
like
one
dazed

I
tried
to
pray

*NL*
the
heavens
seemed
brass
over
my
head

I
was
wild
with
agony
,
and
had
I
*NL*
not
been
placed
under
conditions
which
roused
all
the
resistance

my
*NL*
soul

I
would
have
lost
my
reason

*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
it
not

have
kept
you
ignorant

your
colored
blood

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
the
great
mistake

my

something

cruel

crushing
power

caste

he
tried
to
shield

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

replied
Dr.

thoughtfully

in

I
never

him

did

have
taken

to
France

where
I
should
have
had
a

now
my

``
Best

said
Dr.

There

Dr.

went
South
,
after
his
engagement

through
his
medical
*NL*
skill
and
agreeable
manners
became
very
successful
in
his
practice

In
*NL*
the
following
summer
,
he
built
a
cosy
home
for
the
reception
of
his

came
North
,
where
,
with
Harry
and

as
attendants

*NL*
he
was
married
to

amid

*NL*
CONCLUSION
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
late
in
the
summer
when
Dr.
Latimer
and
his
bride
reached
their
*NL*
home
in
North
Carolina
.
Over
the
cottage
porch
were
morning-glories
to
*NL*
greet
the
first
flushes
of
the
rising
day
,
and
roses
and
jasmines
to
*NL*
distill
their
fragrance
on
the
evening
air
.
Aunt
Linda
,
who
had
been
*NL*
apprised
of
their
coming
,
was
patiently
awaiting
their
arrival
,
and
*NL*
Uncle
Daniel
was
pleased
to
know
that
``
dat
sweet
young
lady
who
had
sich
*NL*
putty
manners
war
comin
'
to

''
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
they
arrived
,
Aunt
Linda
rushed
up
to
Iola
,
folded
her
in
her
*NL*
arms
,
and
joyfully
exclaimed
:
``
How
`
dy

I
`
se

I
*NL*

*NL*
``
But

Linda
,
I
am
not
very
fair

Mrs.

.
*NL*
*NL*
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Latimer
was
much
gratified
by
the
tender
care
Aunt
Linda
bestowed
*NL*
on
Iola
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ai

Aunt
Linda
was
*NL*
kind
and
obliging
,
but
there
was
one
place
where
she
drew
the
line
,
and
*NL*
that
was
at
learning
to
read

*NL*
*NL*
Harry
and
Miss
Delany
accompanied
Iola
as
far
as
her
new
home
,
and
*NL*
remained
several
days
.
The
evening
before
their
departure
,
Harry
took
*NL*
Miss
Delany
a
drive
of
several
miles
through
the
pine
barrens
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
thing
is
getting
very
monotonous

Harry
broke
out
,
when
they
had
*NL*
gone
some
distance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
enjoy
it
!
''
replied
Miss
Delany
.
``
These
stately
pines
look
so
*NL*
grand

solemn

remind

procession

*NL*
*NL*
``
What

talking
about

asked
Harry
,
looking
*NL*
puzzled

*NL*
*NL*
``
About
those
pine-trees

replied
Miss
Delany
,
in
a
tone
of
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pshaw

I
was
n't
thinking
about

I

*NL*
*NL*
``

asked
Lucille

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

it
is
nothing

what

do

playfully

to
the
forlorn
old
bachelors
and
restless
old
maids
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Harry
,
if
you
want
people
to
wish
you
much
happiness
,
why
do
n't
*NL*
you
do
as
the
doctor
has
done
,
get
yourself
a
wife
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
,
''
he
replied
,
soberly
,
``
when
you
say
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Harry
,
do
n't
be
so
absurd
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
there
is
n't
a
bit
of
absurdity
about
what
I
say
.
I
am
in
*NL*
earnest
.
''
There
was
something
in
the
expression
of
Harry
's
face
and
the
*NL*
tone
of
his
voice
which
arrested
the
banter
on
Lucille
's
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
it
was
Charles
Lamb
,
''
replied
Lucille
,
``
who
once
said
that
*NL*
school-teachers
are
uncomfortable
people
,
and
,
Harry
,
I
would
not
like
*NL*
to
make
you
uncomfortable
by
marrying
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
make
me
uncomfortable
by
not
marrying
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
replied
Lucille
,
``
your
mother
may
not
prefer
me
for
a
daughter
.
*NL*
You
know
,
Harry
,
complexional
prejudices
are
not
confined
to
white
*NL*
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
mother
,
''
replied
Harry
,
with
an
air
of
confidence
,
``
is
too
noble
to
*NL*
indulge
in
such
sentiments
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Iola
,
would
she
be
satisfied
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
it
would
add
to
her
satisfaction
.
She
is
not
one
who
ca
n't
be
*NL*
white
and
wo
n't
be
black
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
''
replied
Lucille
,
``
I
will
take
the
question
of
your
comfort
*NL*
into
consideration
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
above
promise
was
thoughtfully
remembered
by
Lucille
till
a
bridal
*NL*
ring
and
happy
marriage
were
the
result
.
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
after
Iola
had
settled
in
C
--
she
quietly
took
her
place
in
the
*NL*
Sunday-school
as
a
teacher
,
and
in
the
church
as
a
helper
.
She
was
*NL*
welcomed
by
the
young
pastor
,
who
found
in
her
a
strong
and
faithful
*NL*
ally
.
Together
they
planned
meetings
for
the
especial
benefit
of
mothers
*NL*
and
children
.
When
the
dens
of
vice
are
spreading
their
snares
for
the
*NL*
feet
of
the
tempted
and
inexperienced
her
doors
are
freely
opened
for
*NL*
the
instruction
of
the
children
before
their
feet
have
wandered
and
gone
*NL*
far
astray
.
She
has
no
carpets
too
fine
for
the
tread
of
their
little
*NL*
feet
.
She
thinks
it
is
better
to
have
stains
on
her
carpet
than
stains
*NL*
on
their
souls
through
any
neglect
of
hers
.
In
lowly
homes
and
*NL*
windowless
cabins
her
visits
are
always
welcome
.
Little
children
love
*NL*
her
.
Old
age
turns
to
her
for
comfort
,
young
girls
for
guidance
,
and
*NL*
mothers
for
counsel
.
Her
life
is
full
of
blessedness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Doctor
Latimer
by
his
kindness
and
skill
has
won
the
name
of
the
``
Good
*NL*
Doctor
.
''
But
he
is
more
than
a
successful
doctor
;
he
is
a
true
patriot
*NL*
and
a
good
citizen
.
Honest
,
just
,
and
discriminating
,
he
endeavors
by
*NL*
precept
and
example
to
instill
into
the
minds
of
others
sentiments
of
*NL*
good
citizenship
.
He
is
a
leader
in
every
reform
movement
for
the
*NL*
benefit
of
the
community
;
but
his
patriotism
is
not
confined
to
race
*NL*
lines
.
``
The
world
is
his
country
,
and
mankind
his
countrymen
.
''
While
he
*NL*
abhors
their
deeds
of
violence
,
he
pities
the
short-sighted
and
besotted
*NL*
men
who
seem
madly
intent
upon
laying
magazines
of
powder
under
the
*NL*
cradles
of
unborn
generations
.
He
has
great
faith
in
the
possibilities
*NL*
of
the
negro
,
and
believes
that
,
enlightened
and
Christianized
,
he
will
*NL*
sink
the
old
animosities
of
slavery
into
the
new
community
of
interests
*NL*
arising
from
freedom
;
and
that
his
influence
upon
the
South
will
be
as
*NL*
the
influence
of
the
sun
upon
the
earth
.
As
when
the
sun
passes
from
*NL*
Capricorn
to
Cancer
,
beauty
,
greenness
,
and
harmony
spring
up
in
his
*NL*
path
,
so
he
hopes
that
the
future
career
of
the
negro
will
be
a
greater
*NL*
influence
for
freedom
and
social
advancement
than
it
was
in
the
days
of
*NL*
yore
for
slavery
and
its
inferior
civilization
.
*NL*
*NL*
Harry
and
Lucille
are
at
the
head
of
a
large
and
flourishing
school
.
*NL*
Lucille
gives
her
ripening
experience
to
her
chosen
work
,
to
which
she
*NL*
was
too
devoted
to
resign
.
And
through
the
school
they
are
lifting
up
*NL*
the
homes
of
the
people
.
Some
have
pitied
,
others
blamed
,
Harry
for
*NL*
casting
his
lot
with
the
colored
people
,
but
he
knows
that
life
's
*NL*
highest
and
best
advantages
do
not
depend
on
the
color
of
the
skin
or
*NL*
texture
of
the
hair
.
He
has
his
reward
in
the
improved
condition
of
his
*NL*
pupils
and
the
superb
manhood
and
noble
life
which
he
has
developed
in
*NL*
his
much
needed
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
Uncle
Daniel
still
lingers
on
the
shores
of
time
,
a
cheery
,
lovable
old
*NL*
man
,
loved
and
respected
by
all
;
a
welcome
guest
in
every
home
.
Soon
*NL*
after
Iola
's
marriage
,
Robert
sold
out
his
business
and
moved
with
his
*NL*
mother
and
sister
to
North
Carolina
.
He
bought
a
large
plantation
near
*NL*
C
--
,
which
he
divided
into
small
homesteads
,
and
sold
to
poor
but
*NL*
thrifty
laborers
,
and
his
heart
has
been
gladdened
by
their
increased
*NL*
prosperity
and
progress
.
He
has
seen
the
one-roomed
cabins
change
to
*NL*
comfortable
cottages
,
in
which
cleanliness
and
order
have
supplanted
the
*NL*
prolific
causes
of
disease
and
death
.
Kind
and
generous
,
he
often
*NL*
remembers
Mrs.
Johnson
and
sends
her
timely
aid
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marie
's
pale
,
spiritual
face
still
bears
traces
of
the
beauty
which
was
*NL*
her
youthful
dower
,
but
its
bloom
has
been
succeeded
by
an
air
of
*NL*
sweetness
and
dignity
.
Though
frail
in
health
,
she
is
always
ready
to
*NL*
lend
a
helping
hand
wherever
and
whenever
she
can
.
*NL*
*NL*
Grandmother
Johnson
was
glad
to
return
South
and
spend
the
remnant
of
*NL*
her
days
with
the
remaining
friends
of
her
early
life
.
Although
feeble
,
*NL*
she
is
in
full
sympathy
with
her
children
for
the
uplifting
of
the
race
.
*NL*
Marie
and
her
mother
are
enjoying
their
aftermath
of
life
,
one
by
*NL*
rendering
to
others
all
the
service
in
her
power
,
while
the
other
,
with
*NL*
her
face
turned
toward
the
celestial
city
,
is
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
waiting
till
the
angels
*NL*
Open
wide
the
mystic
gate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
shadows
have
been
lifted
from
all
their
lives
;
and
peace
,
like
*NL*
bright
dew
,
has
descended
upon
their
paths
.
Blessed
themselves
,
their
*NL*
lives
are
a
blessing
to
others
.

NOTE
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
threads
of
fact
and
fiction
I
have
woven
a
story
whose
mission
will
*NL*
not
be
in
vain
if
it
awaken
in
the
hearts
of
our
countrymen
a
stronger
*NL*
sense
of
justice
and
a
more
Christlike
humanity
in
behalf
of
those
whom
*NL*
the
fortunes
of
war
threw
,
homeless
,
ignorant
and
poor
,
upon
the
*NL*
threshold
of
a
new
era
.
Nor
will
it
be
in
vain
if
it
inspire
the
*NL*
children
of
those
upon
whose
brows
God
has
poured
the
chrism
of
that
new
*NL*
era
to
determine
that
they
will
embrace
every
opportunity
,
develop
every
*NL*
faculty
,
and
use
every
power
God
has
given
them
to
rise
in
the
scale
of
*NL*
character
and
condition
,
and
to
add
their
quota
of
good
citizenship
to
*NL*
the
best
welfare
of
the
nation
.
There
are
scattered
among
us
materials
*NL*
for
mournful
tragedies
and
mirth-provoking
comedies
,
which
some
hand
may
*NL*
yet
bring
into
the
literature
of
the
country
,
glowing
with
the
fervor
of
*NL*
the
tropics
and
enriched
by
the
luxuriance
of
the
Orient
,
and
thus
add
*NL*
to
the
solution
of
our
unsolved
American
problem
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
race
has
not
had
very
long
to
straighten
its
hands
from
the
hoe
,
to
*NL*
grasp
the
pen
and
wield
it
as
a
power
for
good
,
and
to
erect
above
the
*NL*
ruined
auction-block
and
slave-pen
institutions
of
learning
,
but
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
light
beyond
the
darkness
,
*NL*
Joy
beyond
the
present
pain
;
*NL*
There
is
hope
in
God
's
great
justice
*NL*
And
the
negro
's
rising
brain
.
*NL*
Though
the
morning
seems
to
linger
*NL*
O'er
the
hill-tops
far
away
,
*NL*
Yet
the
shadows
bear
the
promise
*NL*
Of
a
brighter
coming
day
.
