INTRODUCTION
TO
IVANHOE
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
Author
of
the
Waverley
Novels
had
hitherto
proceeded
in
an
unabated
*NL*
course
of
popularity
,
and
might
,
in
his
peculiar
district
of
literature
,
*NL*
have
been
termed
``
L'Enfant
Gate
''
of
success
.
It
was
plain
,
however
,
that
*NL*
frequent
publication
must
finally
wear
out
the
public
favour
,
unless
*NL*
some
mode
could
be
devised
to
give
an
appearance
of
novelty
to
*NL*
subsequent
productions
.
Scottish
manners
,
Scottish
dialect
,
and
*NL*
Scottish
characters
of
note
,
being
those
with
which
the
author
was
most
*NL*
intimately
,
and
familiarly
acquainted
,
were
the
groundwork
upon
which
he
*NL*
had
hitherto
relied
for
giving
effect
to
his
narrative
.
It
was
,
however
,
*NL*
obvious
,
that
this
kind
of
interest
must
in
the
end
occasion
a
degree
of
*NL*
sameness
and
repetition
,
if
exclusively
resorted
to
,
and
that
the
reader
*NL*
was
likely
at
length
to
adopt
the
language
of
Edwin
,
in
Parnell
's
Tale
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Reverse
the
spell
,
'
he
cries
,
`
And
let
it
fairly
now
suffice
.
The
*NL*
gambol
has
been
shown
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
can
be
more
dangerous
for
the
fame
of
a
professor
of
the
fine
*NL*
arts
,
than
to
permit
-LRB-
if
he
can
possibly
prevent
it
-RRB-
the
character
of
a
*NL*
mannerist
to
be
attached
to
him
,
or
that
he
should
be
supposed
capable
*NL*
of
success
only
in
a
particular
and
limited
style
.
The
public
are
,
in
*NL*
general
,
very
ready
to
adopt
the
opinion
,
that
he
who
has
pleased
them
*NL*
in
one
peculiar
mode
of
composition
,
is
,
by
means
of
that
very
talent
,
*NL*
rendered
incapable
of
venturing
upon
other
subjects
.
The
effect
of
this
*NL*
disinclination
,
on
the
part
of
the
public
,
towards
the
artificers
of
*NL*
their
pleasures
,
when
they
attempt
to
enlarge
their
means
of
amusing
,
*NL*
may
be
seen
in
the
censures
usually
passed
by
vulgar
criticism
upon
*NL*
actors
or
artists
who
venture
to
change
the
character
of
their
efforts
,
*NL*
that
,
in
so
doing
,
they
may
enlarge
the
scale
of
their
art
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
some
justice
in
this
opinion
,
as
there
always
is
in
such
as
*NL*
attain
general
currency
.
It
may
often
happen
on
the
stage
,
that
an
*NL*
actor
,
by
possessing
in
a
preeminent
degree
the
external
qualities
*NL*
necessary
to
give
effect
to
comedy
,
may
be
deprived
of
the
right
to
*NL*
aspire
to
tragic
excellence
;
and
in
painting
or
literary
composition
,
an
*NL*
artist
or
poet
may
be
master
exclusively
of
modes
of
thought
,
and
powers
*NL*
of
expression
,
which
confine
him
to
a
single
course
of
subjects
.
But
*NL*
much
more
frequently
the
same
capacity
which
carries
a
man
to
popularity
*NL*
in
one
department
will
obtain
for
him
success
in
another
,
and
that
must
*NL*
be
more
particularly
the
case
in
literary
composition
,
than
either
in
*NL*
acting
or
painting
,
because
the
adventurer
in
that
department
is
not
*NL*
impeded
in
his
exertions
by
any
peculiarity
of
features
,
or
conformation
*NL*
of
person
,
proper
for
particular
parts
,
or
,
by
any
peculiar
mechanical
*NL*
habits
of
using
the
pencil
,
limited
to
a
particular
class
of
subjects
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
this
reasoning
be
correct
or
otherwise
,
the
present
author
felt
,
*NL*
that
,
in
confining
himself
to
subjects
purely
Scottish
,
he
was
not
only
*NL*
likely
to
weary
out
the
indulgence
of
his
readers
,
but
also
greatly
to
*NL*
limit
his
own
power
of
affording
them
pleasure
.
In
a
highly
polished
*NL*
country
,
where
so
much
genius
is
monthly
employed
in
catering
for
public
*NL*
amusement
,
a
fresh
topic
,
such
as
he
had
himself
had
the
happiness
to
*NL*
light
upon
,
is
the
untasted
spring
of
the
desert
;
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Men
bless
their
stars
and
call
it
luxury
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
men
and
horses
,
cattle
,
camels
,
and
dromedaries
,
have
poached
*NL*
the
spring
into
mud
,
it
becomes
loathsome
to
those
who
at
first
drank
of
*NL*
it
with
rapture
;
and
he
who
had
the
merit
of
discovering
it
,
if
he
would
*NL*
preserve
his
reputation
with
the
tribe
,
must
display
his
talent
by
a
*NL*
fresh
discovery
of
untasted
fountains
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
author
,
who
finds
himself
limited
to
a
particular
class
of
*NL*
subjects
,
endeavours
to
sustain
his
reputation
by
striving
to
add
a
*NL*
novelty
of
attraction
to
themes
of
the
same
character
which
have
been
*NL*
formerly
successful
under
his
management
,
there
are
manifest
reasons
*NL*
why
,
after
a
certain
point
,
he
is
likely
to
fail
.
If
the
mine
be
not
*NL*
wrought
out
,
the
strength
and
capacity
of
the
miner
become
necessarily
*NL*
exhausted
.
If
he
closely
imitates
the
narratives
which
he
has
before
*NL*
rendered
successful
,
he
is
doomed
to
``
wonder
that
they
please
no
more
.
''
*NL*
If
he
struggles
to
take
a
different
view
of
the
same
class
of
subjects
,
*NL*
he
speedily
discovers
that
what
is
obvious
,
graceful
,
and
natural
,
*NL*
has
been
exhausted
;
and
,
in
order
to
obtain
the
indispensable
charm
of
*NL*
novelty
,
he
is
forced
upon
caricature
,
and
,
to
avoid
being
trite
,
must
*NL*
become
extravagant
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
not
,
perhaps
,
necessary
to
enumerate
so
many
reasons
why
the
*NL*
author
of
the
Scottish
Novels
,
as
they
were
then
exclusively
termed
,
*NL*
should
be
desirous
to
make
an
experiment
on
a
subject
purely
English
.
*NL*
It
was
his
purpose
,
at
the
same
time
,
to
have
rendered
the
experiment
as
*NL*
complete
as
possible
,
by
bringing
the
intended
work
before
the
public
as
*NL*
the
effort
of
a
new
candidate
for
their
favour
,
in
order
that
no
degree
*NL*
of
prejudice
,
whether
favourable
or
the
reverse
,
might
attach
to
it
,
*NL*
as
a
new
production
of
the
Author
of
Waverley
;
but
this
intention
was
*NL*
afterwards
departed
from
,
for
reasons
to
be
hereafter
mentioned
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
period
of
the
narrative
adopted
was
the
reign
of
Richard
I.
,
not
*NL*
only
as
abounding
with
characters
whose
very
names
were
sure
to
attract
*NL*
general
attention
,
but
as
affording
a
striking
contrast
betwixt
the
*NL*
Saxons
,
by
whom
the
soil
was
cultivated
,
and
the
Normans
,
who
still
*NL*
reigned
in
it
as
conquerors
,
reluctant
to
mix
with
the
vanquished
,
or
*NL*
acknowledge
themselves
of
the
same
stock
.
The
idea
of
this
contrast
was
*NL*
taken
from
the
ingenious
and
unfortunate
Logan
's
tragedy
of
Runnamede
,
*NL*
in
which
,
about
the
same
period
of
history
,
the
author
had
seen
the
*NL*
Saxon
and
Norman
barons
opposed
to
each
other
on
different
sides
of
the
*NL*
stage
.
He
does
not
recollect
that
there
was
any
attempt
to
contrast
the
*NL*
two
races
in
their
habits
and
sentiments
;
and
indeed
it
was
obvious
,
*NL*
that
history
was
violated
by
introducing
the
Saxons
still
existing
as
a
*NL*
high-minded
and
martial
race
of
nobles
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
did
,
however
,
survive
as
a
people
,
and
some
of
the
ancient
Saxon
*NL*
families
possessed
wealth
and
power
,
although
they
were
exceptions
to
*NL*
the
humble
condition
of
the
race
in
general
.
It
seemed
to
the
author
,
*NL*
that
the
existence
of
the
two
races
in
the
same
country
,
the
vanquished
*NL*
distinguished
by
their
plain
,
homely
,
blunt
manners
,
and
the
free
spirit
*NL*
infused
by
their
ancient
institutions
and
laws
;
the
victors
,
by
the
*NL*
high
spirit
of
military
fame
,
personal
adventure
,
and
whatever
could
*NL*
distinguish
them
as
the
Flower
of
Chivalry
,
might
,
intermixed
with
other
*NL*
characters
belonging
to
the
same
time
and
country
,
interest
the
reader
*NL*
by
the
contrast
,
if
the
author
should
not
fail
on
his
part
.
*NL*
*NL*
Scotland
,
however
,
had
been
of
late
used
so
exclusively
as
the
scene
*NL*
of
what
is
called
Historical
Romance
,
that
the
preliminary
letter
of
Mr
*NL*
Laurence
Templeton
became
in
some
measure
necessary
.
To
this
,
as
to
an
*NL*
Introduction
,
the
reader
is
referred
,
as
expressing
author
's
purpose
and
*NL*
opinions
in
undertaking
this
species
of
composition
,
under
the
necessary
*NL*
reservation
,
that
he
is
far
from
thinking
he
has
attained
the
point
at
*NL*
which
he
aimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
scarcely
necessary
to
add
,
that
there
was
no
idea
or
wish
to
*NL*
pass
off
the
supposed
Mr
Templeton
as
a
real
person
.
But
a
kind
of
*NL*
continuation
of
the
Tales
of
my
Landlord
had
been
recently
attempted
by
*NL*
a
stranger
,
and
it
was
supposed
this
Dedicatory
Epistle
might
pass
for
*NL*
some
imitation
of
the
same
kind
,
and
thus
putting
enquirers
upon
a
false
*NL*
scent
,
induce
them
to
believe
they
had
before
them
the
work
of
some
new
*NL*
candidate
for
their
favour
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
considerable
part
of
the
work
had
been
finished
and
printed
,
*NL*
the
Publishers
,
who
pretended
to
discern
in
it
a
germ
of
popularity
,
*NL*
remonstrated
strenuously
against
its
appearing
as
an
absolutely
*NL*
anonymous
production
,
and
contended
that
it
should
have
the
advantage
*NL*
of
being
announced
as
by
the
Author
of
Waverley
.
The
author
did
not
make
*NL*
any
obstinate
opposition
,
for
he
began
to
be
of
opinion
with
Dr
Wheeler
,
*NL*
in
Miss
Edgeworth
's
excellent
tale
of
``
Maneuvering
,
''
that
``
Trick
upon
*NL*
Trick
''
might
be
too
much
for
the
patience
of
an
indulgent
public
,
and
*NL*
might
be
reasonably
considered
as
trifling
with
their
favour
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
book
,
therefore
,
appeared
as
an
avowed
continuation
of
the
Waverley
*NL*
Novels
;
and
it
would
be
ungrateful
not
to
acknowledge
,
that
it
met
with
*NL*
the
same
favourable
reception
as
its
predecessors
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
annotations
as
may
be
useful
to
assist
the
reader
in
comprehending
*NL*
the
characters
of
the
Jew
,
the
Templar
,
the
Captain
of
the
mercenaries
,
*NL*
or
Free
Companions
,
as
they
were
called
,
and
others
proper
to
the
*NL*
period
,
are
added
,
but
with
a
sparing
hand
,
since
sufficient
information
*NL*
on
these
subjects
is
to
be
found
in
general
history
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
incident
in
the
tale
,
which
had
the
good
fortune
to
find
favour
in
*NL*
the
eyes
of
many
readers
,
is
more
directly
borrowed
from
the
stores
of
*NL*
old
romance
.
I
mean
the
meeting
of
the
King
with
Friar
Tuck
at
the
cell
*NL*
of
that
buxom
hermit
.
The
general
tone
of
the
story
belongs
to
all
ranks
*NL*
and
all
countries
,
which
emulate
each
other
in
describing
the
rambles
of
*NL*
a
disguised
sovereign
,
who
,
going
in
search
of
information
or
amusement
,
*NL*
into
the
lower
ranks
of
life
,
meets
with
adventures
diverting
to
the
*NL*
reader
or
hearer
,
from
the
contrast
betwixt
the
monarch
's
outward
*NL*
appearance
,
and
his
real
character
.
The
Eastern
tale-teller
has
for
his
*NL*
theme
the
disguised
expeditions
of
Haroun
Alraschid
with
his
faithful
*NL*
attendants
,
Mesrour
and
Giafar
,
through
the
midnight
streets
of
Bagdad
;
*NL*
and
Scottish
tradition
dwells
upon
the
similar
exploits
of
James
V.
,
*NL*
distinguished
during
such
excursions
by
the
travelling
name
of
the
*NL*
Goodman
of
Ballengeigh
,
as
the
Commander
of
the
Faithful
,
when
he
*NL*
desired
to
be
incognito
,
was
known
by
that
of
Il
Bondocani
.
The
French
*NL*
minstrels
are
not
silent
on
so
popular
a
theme
.
There
must
have
been
*NL*
a
Norman
original
of
the
Scottish
metrical
romance
of
Rauf
Colziar
,
in
*NL*
which
Charlemagne
is
introduced
as
the
unknown
guest
of
a
charcoal-man
.
*NL*
-LSB-
2
-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
It
seems
to
have
been
the
original
of
other
poems
of
the
kind
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
merry
England
there
is
no
end
of
popular
ballads
on
this
theme
.
The
*NL*
poem
of
John
the
Reeve
,
or
Steward
,
mentioned
by
Bishop
Percy
,
in
*NL*
the
Reliques
of
English
Poetry
,
-LSB-
3
-RSB-
is
said
to
have
turned
on
such
an
*NL*
incident
;
and
we
have
besides
,
the
King
and
the
Tanner
of
Tamworth
,
the
*NL*
King
and
the
Miller
of
Mansfield
,
and
others
on
the
same
topic
.
But
*NL*
the
peculiar
tale
of
this
nature
to
which
the
author
of
Ivanhoe
has
to
*NL*
acknowledge
an
obligation
,
is
more
ancient
by
two
centuries
than
any
of
*NL*
these
last
mentioned
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
first
communicated
to
the
public
in
that
curious
record
of
*NL*
ancient
literature
,
which
has
been
accumulated
by
the
combined
exertions
*NL*
of
Sir
Egerton
Brydges
.
and
Mr
Hazlewood
,
in
the
periodical
work
*NL*
entitled
the
British
Bibliographer
.
From
thence
it
has
been
transferred
*NL*
by
the
Reverend
Charles
Henry
Hartsborne
,
M.A.
,
editor
of
a
very
curious
*NL*
volume
,
entitled
``
Ancient
Metrical
Tales
,
printed
chiefly
from
original
*NL*
sources
,
1829
.
''
Mr
Hartshorne
gives
no
other
authority
for
the
present
*NL*
fragment
,
except
the
article
in
the
Bibliographer
,
where
it
is
entitled
*NL*
the
Kyng
and
the
Hermite
.
A
short
abstract
of
its
contents
will
show
its
*NL*
similarity
to
the
meeting
of
King
Richard
and
Friar
Tuck
.
*NL*
*NL*
King
Edward
-LRB-
we
are
not
told
which
among
the
monarchs
of
that
name
,
but
,
*NL*
from
his
temper
and
habits
,
we
may
suppose
Edward
IV
.
-RRB-
sets
forth
with
*NL*
his
court
to
a
gallant
hunting-match
in
Sherwood
Forest
,
in
which
,
as
*NL*
is
not
unusual
for
princes
in
romance
,
he
falls
in
with
a
deer
of
*NL*
extraordinary
size
and
swiftness
,
and
pursues
it
closely
,
till
he
has
*NL*
outstripped
his
whole
retinue
,
tired
out
hounds
and
horse
,
and
finds
*NL*
himself
alone
under
the
gloom
of
an
extensive
forest
,
upon
which
*NL*
night
is
descending
.
Under
the
apprehensions
natural
to
a
situation
so
*NL*
uncomfortable
,
the
king
recollects
that
he
has
heard
how
poor
men
,
when
*NL*
apprehensive
of
a
bad
nights
lodging
,
pray
to
Saint
Julian
,
who
,
in
the
*NL*
Romish
calendar
,
stands
Quarter-Master-General
to
all
forlorn
travellers
*NL*
that
render
him
due
homage
.
Edward
puts
up
his
orisons
accordingly
,
and
*NL*
by
the
guidance
,
doubtless
,
of
the
good
Saint
,
reaches
a
small
path
,
*NL*
conducting
him
to
a
chapel
in
the
forest
,
having
a
hermit
's
cell
in
its
*NL*
close
vicinity
.
The
King
hears
the
reverend
man
,
with
a
companion
of
his
*NL*
solitude
,
telling
his
beads
within
,
and
meekly
requests
of
him
quarters
*NL*
for
the
night
.
``
I
have
no
accommodation
for
such
a
lord
as
ye
be
,
''
said
*NL*
the
Hermit
.
``
I
live
here
in
the
wilderness
upon
roots
and
rinds
,
and
may
*NL*
not
receive
into
my
dwelling
even
the
poorest
wretch
that
lives
,
unless
*NL*
it
were
to
save
his
life
.
''
The
King
enquires
the
way
to
the
next
*NL*
town
,
and
,
understanding
it
is
by
a
road
which
he
can
not
find
without
*NL*
difficulty
,
even
if
he
had
daylight
to
befriend
him
,
he
declares
,
that
*NL*
with
or
without
the
Hermit
's
consent
,
he
is
determined
to
be
his
guest
*NL*
that
night
.
He
is
admitted
accordingly
,
not
without
a
hint
from
the
*NL*
Recluse
,
that
were
he
himself
out
of
his
priestly
weeds
,
he
would
care
*NL*
little
for
his
threats
of
using
violence
,
and
that
he
gives
way
to
him
*NL*
not
out
of
intimidation
,
but
simply
to
avoid
scandal
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
King
is
admitted
into
the
cell
--
two
bundles
of
straw
are
shaken
*NL*
down
for
his
accommodation
,
and
he
comforts
himself
that
he
is
now
under
*NL*
shelter
,
and
that
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
night
will
soon
be
gone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Other
wants
,
however
,
arise
.
The
guest
becomes
clamorous
for
supper
,
*NL*
observing
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
certainly
,
as
I
you
say
,
*NL*
I
ne
had
never
so
sorry
a
day
,
*NL*
That
I
ne
had
a
merry
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
indication
of
his
taste
for
good
cheer
,
joined
to
the
*NL*
annunciation
of
his
being
a
follower
of
the
Court
,
who
had
lost
himself
*NL*
at
the
great
hunting-match
,
can
not
induce
the
niggard
Hermit
to
produce
*NL*
better
fare
than
bread
and
cheese
,
for
which
his
guest
showed
little
*NL*
appetite
;
and
``
thin
drink
,
''
which
was
even
less
acceptable
.
At
length
*NL*
the
King
presses
his
host
on
a
point
to
which
he
had
more
than
once
*NL*
alluded
,
without
obtaining
a
satisfactory
reply
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
said
the
King
,
`
by
God
's
grace
,
*NL*
Thou
wert
in
a
merry
place
,
*NL*
To
shoot
should
thou
here
*NL*
When
the
foresters
go
to
rest
,
*NL*
Sometyme
thou
might
have
of
the
best
,
*NL*
All
of
the
wild
deer
;
*NL*
I
wold
hold
it
for
no
scathe
,
*NL*
Though
thou
hadst
bow
and
arrows
baith
,
*NL*
Althoff
thou
best
a
Frere
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Hermit
,
in
return
,
expresses
his
apprehension
that
his
guest
means
*NL*
to
drag
him
into
some
confession
of
offence
against
the
forest
laws
,
*NL*
which
,
being
betrayed
to
the
King
,
might
cost
him
his
life
.
Edward
*NL*
answers
by
fresh
assurances
of
secrecy
,
and
again
urges
on
him
the
*NL*
necessity
of
procuring
some
venison
.
The
Hermit
replies
,
by
once
more
*NL*
insisting
on
the
duties
incumbent
upon
him
as
a
churchman
,
and
continues
*NL*
to
affirm
himself
free
from
all
such
breaches
of
order
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Many
day
I
have
here
been
,
*NL*
And
flesh-meat
I
eat
never
,
*NL*
But
milk
of
the
kye
;
*NL*
Warm
thee
well
,
and
go
to
sleep
,
*NL*
And
I
will
lap
thee
with
my
cope
,
*NL*
Softly
to
lye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
seem
that
the
manuscript
is
here
imperfect
,
for
we
do
not
find
*NL*
the
reasons
which
finally
induce
the
curtal
Friar
to
amend
the
King
's
*NL*
cheer
.
But
acknowledging
his
guest
to
be
such
a
``
good
fellow
''
as
has
*NL*
seldom
graced
his
board
,
the
holy
man
at
length
produces
the
best
his
*NL*
cell
affords
.
Two
candles
are
placed
on
a
table
,
white
bread
and
baked
*NL*
pasties
are
displayed
by
the
light
,
besides
choice
of
venison
,
both
salt
*NL*
and
fresh
,
from
which
they
select
collops
.
``
I
might
have
eaten
my
bread
*NL*
dry
,
''
said
the
King
,
``
had
I
not
pressed
thee
on
the
score
of
archery
,
*NL*
but
now
have
I
dined
like
a
prince
--
if
we
had
but
drink
enow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
too
is
afforded
by
the
hospitable
anchorite
,
who
dispatches
an
*NL*
assistant
to
fetch
a
pot
of
four
gallons
from
a
secret
corner
near
his
*NL*
bed
,
and
the
whole
three
set
in
to
serious
drinking
.
This
amusement
*NL*
is
superintended
by
the
Friar
,
according
to
the
recurrence
of
certain
*NL*
fustian
words
,
to
be
repeated
by
every
compotator
in
turn
before
he
*NL*
drank
--
a
species
of
High
Jinks
,
as
it
were
,
by
which
they
regulated
*NL*
their
potations
,
as
toasts
were
given
in
latter
times
.
The
one
toper
*NL*
says
``
fusty
bandias
''
,
to
which
the
other
is
obliged
to
reply
,
``
strike
*NL*
pantnere
''
,
and
the
Friar
passes
many
jests
on
the
King
's
want
of
memory
,
*NL*
who
sometimes
forgets
the
words
of
action
.
The
night
is
spent
in
this
*NL*
jolly
pastime
.
Before
his
departure
in
the
morning
,
the
King
invites
his
*NL*
reverend
host
to
Court
,
promises
,
at
least
,
to
requite
his
hospitality
,
*NL*
and
expresses
himself
much
pleased
with
his
entertainment
.
The
jolly
*NL*
Hermit
at
length
agrees
to
venture
thither
,
and
to
enquire
for
Jack
*NL*
Fletcher
,
which
is
the
name
assumed
by
the
King
.
After
the
Hermit
has
*NL*
shown
Edward
some
feats
of
archery
,
the
joyous
pair
separate
.
The
King
*NL*
rides
home
,
and
rejoins
his
retinue
.
As
the
romance
is
imperfect
,
we
are
*NL*
not
acquainted
how
the
discovery
takes
place
;
but
it
is
probably
much
*NL*
in
the
same
manner
as
in
other
narratives
turning
on
the
same
subject
,
*NL*
where
the
host
,
apprehensive
of
death
for
having
trespassed
on
the
*NL*
respect
due
to
his
Sovereign
,
while
incognito
,
is
agreeably
surprised
by
*NL*
receiving
honours
and
reward
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
Mr
Hartshorne
's
collection
,
there
is
a
romance
on
the
same
*NL*
foundation
,
called
King
Edward
and
the
Shepherd
,
-LSB-
4
-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
which
,
considered
as
illustrating
manners
,
is
still
more
curious
than
*NL*
the
King
and
the
Hermit
;
but
it
is
foreign
to
the
present
purpose
.
*NL*
The
reader
has
here
the
original
legend
from
which
the
incident
in
the
*NL*
romance
is
derived
;
and
the
identifying
the
irregular
Eremite
with
the
*NL*
Friar
Tuck
of
Robin
Hood
's
story
,
was
an
obvious
expedient
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
name
of
Ivanhoe
was
suggested
by
an
old
rhyme
.
All
novelists
have
*NL*
had
occasion
at
some
time
or
other
to
wish
with
Falstaff
,
that
they
knew
*NL*
where
a
commodity
of
good
names
was
to
be
had
.
On
such
an
occasion
the
*NL*
author
chanced
to
call
to
memory
a
rhyme
recording
three
names
of
the
*NL*
manors
forfeited
by
the
ancestor
of
the
celebrated
Hampden
,
for
striking
*NL*
the
Black
Prince
a
blow
with
his
racket
,
when
they
quarrelled
at
tennis
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tring
,
Wing
,
and
Ivanhoe
,
*NL*
For
striking
of
a
blow
,
*NL*
Hampden
did
forego
,
*NL*
And
glad
he
could
escape
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
word
suited
the
author
's
purpose
in
two
material
respects
,
--
for
,
*NL*
first
,
it
had
an
ancient
English
sound
;
and
secondly
,
it
conveyed
no
*NL*
indication
whatever
of
the
nature
of
the
story
.
He
presumes
to
hold
*NL*
this
last
quality
to
be
of
no
small
importance
.
What
is
called
a
taking
*NL*
title
,
serves
the
direct
interest
of
the
bookseller
or
publisher
,
who
by
*NL*
this
means
sometimes
sells
an
edition
while
it
is
yet
passing
the
press
.
*NL*
But
if
the
author
permits
an
over
degree
of
attention
to
be
drawn
to
*NL*
his
work
ere
it
has
appeared
,
he
places
himself
in
the
embarrassing
*NL*
condition
of
having
excited
a
degree
of
expectation
which
,
if
he
*NL*
proves
unable
to
satisfy
,
is
an
error
fatal
to
his
literary
reputation
.
*NL*
Besides
,
when
we
meet
such
a
title
as
the
Gunpowder
Plot
,
or
any
other
*NL*
connected
with
general
history
,
each
reader
,
before
he
has
seen
the
*NL*
book
,
has
formed
to
himself
some
particular
idea
of
the
sort
of
manner
*NL*
in
which
the
story
is
to
be
conducted
,
and
the
nature
of
the
amusement
*NL*
which
he
is
to
derive
from
it
.
In
this
he
is
probably
disappointed
,
and
*NL*
in
that
case
may
be
naturally
disposed
to
visit
upon
the
author
or
the
*NL*
work
,
the
unpleasant
feelings
thus
excited
.
In
such
a
case
the
literary
*NL*
adventurer
is
censured
,
not
for
having
missed
the
mark
at
which
he
*NL*
himself
aimed
,
but
for
not
having
shot
off
his
shaft
in
a
direction
he
*NL*
never
thought
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
footing
of
unreserved
communication
which
the
Author
has
*NL*
established
with
the
reader
,
he
may
here
add
the
trifling
circumstance
,
*NL*
that
a
roll
of
Norman
warriors
,
occurring
in
the
Auchinleck
Manuscript
,
*NL*
gave
him
the
formidable
name
of
Front-de-Boeuf
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ivanhoe
was
highly
successful
upon
its
appearance
,
and
may
be
said
to
*NL*
have
procured
for
its
author
the
freedom
of
the
Rules
,
since
he
has
ever
*NL*
since
been
permitted
to
exercise
his
powers
of
fictitious
composition
in
*NL*
England
,
as
well
as
Scotland
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
character
of
the
fair
Jewess
found
so
much
favour
in
the
eyes
of
*NL*
some
fair
readers
,
that
the
writer
was
censured
,
because
,
when
arranging
*NL*
the
fates
of
the
characters
of
the
drama
,
he
had
not
assigned
the
hand
*NL*
of
Wilfred
to
Rebecca
,
rather
than
the
less
interesting
Rowena
.
But
,
not
*NL*
to
mention
that
the
prejudices
of
the
age
rendered
such
an
union
almost
*NL*
impossible
,
the
author
may
,
in
passing
,
observe
,
that
he
thinks
a
*NL*
character
of
a
highly
virtuous
and
lofty
stamp
,
is
degraded
rather
than
*NL*
exalted
by
an
attempt
to
reward
virtue
with
temporal
prosperity
.
Such
*NL*
is
not
the
recompense
which
Providence
has
deemed
worthy
of
suffering
*NL*
merit
,
and
it
is
a
dangerous
and
fatal
doctrine
to
teach
young
persons
,
*NL*
the
most
common
readers
of
romance
,
that
rectitude
of
conduct
and
of
*NL*
principle
are
either
naturally
allied
with
,
or
adequately
rewarded
by
,
*NL*
the
gratification
of
our
passions
,
or
attainment
of
our
wishes
.
In
a
*NL*
word
,
if
a
virtuous
and
self-denied
character
is
dismissed
with
temporal
*NL*
wealth
,
greatness
,
rank
,
or
the
indulgence
of
such
a
rashly
formed
or
*NL*
ill
assorted
passion
as
that
of
Rebecca
for
Ivanhoe
,
the
reader
will
be
*NL*
apt
to
say
,
verily
Virtue
has
had
its
reward
.
But
a
glance
on
the
great
*NL*
picture
of
life
will
show
,
that
the
duties
of
self-denial
,
and
the
*NL*
sacrifice
of
passion
to
principle
,
are
seldom
thus
remunerated
;
and
*NL*
that
the
internal
consciousness
of
their
high-minded
discharge
of
duty
,
*NL*
produces
on
their
own
reflections
a
more
adequate
recompense
,
in
the
*NL*
form
of
that
peace
which
the
world
can
not
give
or
take
away
.

DEDICATORY
EPISTLE
*NL*
*NL*
TO
*NL*
*NL*
THE
REV.
DR
DRYASDUST
,
F.A.S.
*NL*
*NL*
Residing
in
the
Castle-Gate
,

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Much
esteemed
and
dear
Sir
,
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
scarcely
necessary
to
mention
the
various
and
concurring
reasons
*NL*
which
induce
me
to
place
your
name
at
the
head
of
the
following
*NL*
work
.
Yet
the
chief
of
these
reasons
may
perhaps
be
refuted
by
the
*NL*
imperfections
of
the
performance
.
Could
I
have
hoped
to
render
it
worthy
*NL*
of
your
patronage
,
the
public
would
at
once
have
seen
the
propriety
of
*NL*
inscribing
a
work
designed
to
illustrate
the
domestic
antiquities
of
*NL*
England
,
and
particularly
of
our
Saxon
forefathers
,
to
the
learned
*NL*
author
of
the
Essays
upon
the
Horn
of
King
Ulphus
,
and
on
the
Lands
*NL*
bestowed
by
him
upon
the
patrimony
of
St
Peter
.
I
am
conscious
,
however
,
*NL*
that
the
slight
,
unsatisfactory
,
and
trivial
manner
,
in
which
the
result
*NL*
of
my
antiquarian
researches
has
been
recorded
in
the
following
pages
,
*NL*
takes
the
work
from
under
that
class
which
bears
the
proud
motto
,
*NL*
``
Detur
digniori
''
.
On
the
contrary
,
I
fear
I
shall
incur
the
censure
of
*NL*
presumption
in
placing
the
venerable
name
of
Dr
Jonas
Dryasdust
at
the
*NL*
head
of
a
publication
,
which
the
more
grave
antiquary
will
perhaps
class
*NL*
with
the
idle
novels
and
romances
of
the
day
.
I
am
anxious
to
vindicate
*NL*
myself
from
such
a
charge
;
for
although
I
might
trust
to
your
friendship
*NL*
for
an
apology
in
your
eyes
,
yet
I
would
not
willingly
stand
conviction
*NL*
in
those
of
the
public
of
so
grave
a
crime
,
as
my
fears
lead
me
to
*NL*
anticipate
my
being
charged
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
must
therefore
remind
you
,
that
when
we
first
talked
over
together
*NL*
that
class
of
productions
,
in
one
of
which
the
private
and
family
*NL*
affairs
of
your
learned
northern
friend
,
Mr
Oldbuck
of
Monkbarns
,
were
*NL*
so
unjustifiably
exposed
to
the
public
,
some
discussion
occurred
between
*NL*
us
concerning
the
cause
of
the
popularity
these
works
have
attained
*NL*
in
this
idle
age
,
which
,
whatever
other
merit
they
possess
,
must
be
*NL*
admitted
to
be
hastily
written
,
and
in
violation
of
every
rule
assigned
*NL*
to
the
epopeia
.
It
seemed
then
to
be
your
opinion
,
that
the
charm
lay
*NL*
entirely
in
the
art
with
which
the
unknown
author
had
availed
himself
,
*NL*
like
a
second
M'Pherson
,
of
the
antiquarian
stores
which
lay
scattered
*NL*
around
him
,
supplying
his
own
indolence
or
poverty
of
invention
,
by
the
*NL*
incidents
which
had
actually
taken
place
in
his
country
at
no
distant
*NL*
period
,
by
introducing
real
characters
,
and
scarcely
suppressing
real
*NL*
names
.
It
was
not
above
sixty
or
seventy
years
,
you
observed
,
since
the
*NL*
whole
north
of
Scotland
was
under
a
state
of
government
nearly
as
simple
*NL*
and
as
patriarchal
as
those
of
our
good
allies
the
Mohawks
and
Iroquois
.
*NL*
Admitting
that
the
author
can
not
himself
be
supposed
to
have
witnessed
*NL*
those
times
,
he
must
have
lived
,
you
observed
,
among
persons
who
had
*NL*
acted
and
suffered
in
them
;
and
even
within
these
thirty
years
,
such
*NL*
an
infinite
change
has
taken
place
in
the
manners
of
Scotland
,
that
*NL*
men
look
back
upon
the
habits
of
society
proper
to
their
immediate
*NL*
ancestors
,
as
we
do
on
those
of
the
reign
of
Queen
Anne
,
or
even
the
*NL*
period
of
the
Revolution
.
Having
thus
materials
of
every
kind
lying
*NL*
strewed
around
him
,
there
was
little
,
you
observed
,
to
embarrass
the
*NL*
author
,
but
the
difficulty
of
choice
.
It
was
no
wonder
,
therefore
,
that
,
*NL*
having
begun
to
work
a
mine
so
plentiful
,
he
should
have
derived
from
*NL*
his
works
fully
more
credit
and
profit
than
the
facility
of
his
labours
*NL*
merited
.
*NL*
*NL*
Admitting
-LRB-
as
I
could
not
deny
-RRB-
the
general
truth
of
these
conclusions
,
*NL*
I
can
not
but
think
it
strange
that
no
attempt
has
been
made
to
excite
an
*NL*
interest
for
the
traditions
and
manners
of
Old
England
,
similiar
to
*NL*
that
which
has
been
obtained
in
behalf
of
those
of
our
poorer
and
*NL*
less
celebrated
neighbours
.
The
Kendal
green
,
though
its
date
is
more
*NL*
ancient
,
ought
surely
to
be
as
dear
to
our
feelings
,
as
the
variegated
*NL*
tartans
of
the
north
.
The
name
of
Robin
Hood
,
if
duly
conjured
with
,
*NL*
should
raise
a
spirit
as
soon
as
that
of
Rob
Roy
;
and
the
patriots
of
*NL*
England
deserve
no
less
their
renown
in
our
modern
circles
,
than
the
*NL*
Bruces
and
Wallaces
of
Caledonia
.
If
the
scenery
of
the
south
be
less
*NL*
romantic
and
sublime
than
that
of
the
northern
mountains
,
it
must
be
*NL*
allowed
to
possess
in
the
same
proportion
superior
softness
and
beauty
;
*NL*
and
upon
the
whole
,
we
feel
ourselves
entitled
to
exclaim
with
the
*NL*
patriotic
Syrian
--
``
Are
not
Pharphar
and
Abana
,
rivers
of
Damascus
,
*NL*
better
than
all
the
rivers
of
Israel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Your
objections
to
such
an
attempt
,
my
dear
Doctor
,
were
,
you
may
*NL*
remember
,
two-fold
.
You
insisted
upon
the
advantages
which
the
Scotsman
*NL*
possessed
,
from
the
very
recent
existence
of
that
state
of
society
*NL*
in
which
his
scene
was
to
be
laid
.
Many
now
alive
,
you
remarked
,
well
*NL*
remembered
persons
who
had
not
only
seen
the
celebrated
Roy
*NL*
M'Gregor
,
but
had
feasted
,
and
even
fought
with
him
.
All
those
minute
*NL*
circumstances
belonging
to
private
life
and
domestic
character
,
all
that
*NL*
gives
verisimilitude
to
a
narrative
,
and
individuality
to
the
persons
*NL*
introduced
,
is
still
known
and
remembered
in
Scotland
;
whereas
in
*NL*
England
,
civilisation
has
been
so
long
complete
,
that
our
ideas
of
our
*NL*
ancestors
are
only
to
be
gleaned
from
musty
records
and
chronicles
,
the
*NL*
authors
of
which
seem
perversely
to
have
conspired
to
suppress
in
their
*NL*
narratives
all
interesting
details
,
in
order
to
find
room
for
flowers
of
*NL*
monkish
eloquence
,
or
trite
reflections
upon
morals
.
To
match
an
English
*NL*
and
a
Scottish
author
in
the
rival
task
of
embodying
and
reviving
the
*NL*
traditions
of
their
respective
countries
,
would
be
,
you
alleged
,
in
the
*NL*
highest
degree
unequal
and
unjust
.
The
Scottish
magician
,
you
said
,
was
,
*NL*
like
Lucan
's
witch
,
at
liberty
to
walk
over
the
recent
field
of
battle
,
*NL*
and
to
select
for
the
subject
of
resuscitation
by
his
sorceries
,
a
body
*NL*
whose
limbs
had
recently
quivered
with
existence
,
and
whose
throat
*NL*
had
but
just
uttered
the
last
note
of
agony
.
Such
a
subject
even
the
*NL*
powerful
Erictho
was
compelled
to
select
,
as
alone
capable
of
being
*NL*
reanimated
even
by
``
her
''
potent
magic
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
gelidas

,
*NL*
Pulmonis

Invenit

in
corpore
quaerit
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
English
author
,
on
the
other
hand
,
without
supposing
him
less
of
*NL*
a
conjuror
than
the
Northern
Warlock
,
can
,
you
observed
,
only
have
the
*NL*
liberty
of
selecting
his
subject
amidst
the
dust
of
antiquity
,
where
*NL*
nothing
was
to
be
found
but
dry
,
sapless
,
mouldering
,
and
disjointed
*NL*
bones
,
such
as
those
which
filled
the
valley
of
Jehoshaphat
.
You
*NL*
expressed
,
besides
,
your
apprehension
,
that
the
unpatriotic
prejudices
*NL*
of
my
countrymen
would
not
allow
fair
play
to
such
a
work
as
that
of
*NL*
which
I
endeavoured
to
demonstrate
the
probable
success
.
And
this
,
you
*NL*
said
,
was
not
entirely
owing
to
the
more
general
prejudice
in
favour
of
*NL*
that
which
is
foreign
,
but
that
it
rested
partly
upon
improbabilities
,
*NL*
arising
out
of
the
circumstances
in
which
the
English
reader
is
placed
.
*NL*
If
you
describe
to
him
a
set
of
wild
manners
,
and
a
state
of
primitive
*NL*
society
existing
in
the
Highlands
of
Scotland
,
he
is
much
disposed
to
*NL*
acquiesce
in
the
truth
of
what
is
asserted
.
And
reason
good
.
If
he
be
*NL*
of
the
ordinary
class
of
readers
,
he
has
either
never
seen
those
remote
*NL*
districts
at
all
,
or
he
has
wandered
through
those
desolate
regions
in
*NL*
the
course
of
a
summer
tour
,
eating
bad
dinners
,
sleeping
on
truckle
*NL*
beds
,
stalking
from
desolation
to
desolation
,
and
fully
prepared
to
*NL*
believe
the
strangest
things
that
could
be
told
him
of
a
people
,
wild
*NL*
and
extravagant
enough
to
be
attached
to
scenery
so
extraordinary
.
*NL*
But
the
same
worthy
person
,
when
placed
in
his
own
snug
parlour
,
and
*NL*
surrounded
by
all
the
comforts
of
an
Englishman
's
fireside
,
is
not
half
*NL*
so
much
disposed
to
believe
that
his
own
ancestors
led
a
very
different
*NL*
life
from
himself
;
that
the
shattered
tower
,
which
now
forms
a
vista
*NL*
from
his
window
,
once
held
a
baron
who
would
have
hung
him
up
at
his
*NL*
own
door
without
any
form
of
trial
;
that
the
hinds
,
by
whom
his
little
*NL*
pet-farm
is
managed
,
a
few
centuries
ago
would
have
been
his
slaves
;
*NL*
and
that
the
complete
influence
of
feudal
tyranny
once
extended
over
the
*NL*
neighbouring
village
,
where
the
attorney
is
now
a
man
of
more
importance
*NL*
than
the
lord
of
the
manor
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
I
own
the
force
of
these
objections
,
I
must
confess
,
at
the
same
*NL*
time
,
that
they
do
not
appear
to
me
to
be
altogether
insurmountable
.
The
*NL*
scantiness
of
materials
is
indeed
a
formidable
difficulty
;
but
no
one
*NL*
knows
better
than
Dr
Dryasdust
,
that
to
those
deeply
read
in
antiquity
,
*NL*
hints
concerning
the
private
life
of
our
ancestors
lie
scattered
*NL*
through
the
pages
of
our
various
historians
,
bearing
,
indeed
,
a
slender
*NL*
proportion
to
the
other
matters
of
which
they
treat
,
but
still
,
when
*NL*
collected
together
,
sufficient
to
throw
considerable
light
upon
the
``
vie
*NL*
prive
''
of
our
forefathers
;
indeed
,
I
am
convinced
,
that
however
I
myself
*NL*
may
fail
in
the
ensuing
attempt
,
yet
,
with
more
labour
in
collecting
,
or
*NL*
more
skill
in
using
,
the
materials
within
his
reach
,
illustrated
as
they
*NL*
have
been
by
the
labours
of
Dr
Henry
,
of
the
late
Mr
Strutt
,
and
,
above
*NL*
all
,
of
Mr
Sharon
Turner
,
an
abler
hand
would
have
been
successful
;
*NL*
and
therefore
I
protest
,
beforehand
,
against
any
argument
which
may
be
*NL*
founded
on
the
failure
of
the
present
experiment
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
other
hand
,
I
have
already
said
,
that
if
any
thing
like
a
true
*NL*
picture
of
old
English
manners
could
be
drawn
,
I
would
trust
to
the
*NL*
good-nature
and
good
sense
of
my
countrymen
for
insuring
its
favourable
*NL*
reception
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
thus
replied
,
to
the
best
of
my
power
,
to
the
first
class
of
*NL*
your
objections
,
or
at
least
having
shown
my
resolution
to
overleap
the
*NL*
barriers
which
your
prudence
has
raised
,
I
will
be
brief
in
noticing
*NL*
that
which
is
more
peculiar
to
myself
.
It
seems
to
be
your
opinion
,
that
*NL*
the
very
office
of
an
antiquary
,
employed
in
grave
,
and
,
as
the
*NL*
vulgar
will
sometimes
allege
,
in
toilsome
and
minute
research
,
must
be
*NL*
considered
as
incapacitating
him
from
successfully
compounding
a
tale
of
*NL*
this
sort
.
But
permit
me
to
say
,
my
dear
Doctor
,
that
this
objection
*NL*
is
rather
formal
than
substantial
.
It
is
true
,
that
such
slight
*NL*
compositions
might
not
suit
the
severer
genius
of
our
friend
Mr
Oldbuck
.
*NL*
Yet
Horace
Walpole
wrote
a
goblin
tale
which
has
thrilled
through
many
a
*NL*
bosom
;
and
George
Ellis
could
transfer
all
the
playful
fascination
of
*NL*
a
humour
,
as
delightful
as
it
was
uncommon
,
into
his
Abridgement
of
the
*NL*
Ancient
Metrical
Romances
.
So
that
,
however
I
may
have
occasion
to
rue
*NL*
my
present
audacity
,
I
have
at
least
the
most
respectable
precedents
in
*NL*
my
favour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
the
severer
antiquary
may
think
,
that
,
by
thus
intermingling
*NL*
fiction
with
truth
,
I
am
polluting
the
well
of
history
with
modern
*NL*
inventions
,
and
impressing
upon
the
rising
generation
false
ideas
of
the
*NL*
age
which
I
describe
.
I
can
not
but
in
some
sense
admit
the
force
of
this
*NL*
reasoning
,
which
I
yet
hope
to
traverse
by
the
following
considerations
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
true
,
that
I
neither
can
,
nor
do
pretend
,
to
the
observation
of
*NL*
complete
accuracy
,
even
in
matters
of
outward
costume
,
much
less
in
the
*NL*
more
important
points
of
language
and
manners
.
But
the
same
motive
*NL*
which
prevents
my
writing
the
dialogue
of
the
piece
in
Anglo-Saxon
or
in
*NL*
Norman-French
,
and
which
prohibits
my
sending
forth
to
the
public
this
*NL*
essay
printed
with
the
types
of
Caxton
or
Wynken
de
Worde
,
prevents
my
*NL*
attempting
to
confine
myself
within
the
limits
of
the
period
in
which
my
*NL*
story
is
laid
.
It
is
necessary
,
for
exciting
interest
of
any
kind
,
that
*NL*
the
subject
assumed
should
be
,
as
it
were
,
translated
into
the
manners
,
*NL*
as
well
as
the
language
,
of
the
age
we
live
in
.
No
fascination
has
*NL*
ever
been
attached
to
Oriental
literature
,
equal
to
that
produced
by
Mr
*NL*
Galland
's
first
translation
of
the
Arabian
Tales
;
in
which
,
retaining
*NL*
on
the
one
hand
the
splendour
of
Eastern
costume
,
and
on
the
other
the
*NL*
wildness
of
Eastern
fiction
,
he
mixed
these
with
just
so
much
ordinary
*NL*
feeling
and
expression
,
as
rendered
them
interesting
and
intelligible
,
*NL*
while
he
abridged
the
long-winded
narratives
,
curtailed
the
monotonous
*NL*
reflections
,
and
rejected
the
endless
repetitions
of
the
Arabian
*NL*
original
.
The
tales
,
therefore
,
though
less
purely
Oriental
than
in
*NL*
their
first
concoction
,
were
eminently
better
fitted
for
the
European
*NL*
market
,
and
obtained
an
unrivalled
degree
of
public
favour
,
which
they
*NL*
certainly
would
never
have
gained
had
not
the
manners
and
style
been
*NL*
in
some
degree
familiarized
to
the
feelings
and
habits
of
the
western
*NL*
reader
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
point
of
justice
,
therefore
,
to
the
multitudes
who
will
,
I
trust
,
*NL*
devour
this
book
with
avidity
,
I
have
so
far
explained
our
ancient
*NL*
manners
in
modern
language
,
and
so
far
detailed
the
characters
and
*NL*
sentiments
of
my
persons
,
that
the
modern
reader
will
not
find
himself
,
*NL*
I
should
hope
,
much
trammelled
by
the
repulsive
dryness
of
mere
*NL*
antiquity
.
In
this
,
I
respectfully
contend
,
I
have
in
no
respect
*NL*
exceeded
the
fair
license
due
to
the
author
of
a
fictitious
composition
.
*NL*
The
late
ingenious
Mr
Strutt
,
in
his
romance
of
Queen-Hoo-Hall
,
-LSB-
5
-RSB-
*NL*
acted
upon
another
principle
;
and
in
distinguishing
between
what
was
*NL*
ancient
and
modern
,
forgot
,
as
it
appears
to
me
,
that
extensive
neutral
*NL*
ground
,
the
large
proportion
,
that
is
,
of
manners
and
sentiments
which
*NL*
are
common
to
us
and
to
our
ancestors
,
having
been
handed
down
unaltered
*NL*
from
them
to
us
,
or
which
,
arising
out
of
the
principles
of
our
common
*NL*
nature
,
must
have
existed
alike
in
either
state
of
society
.
In
this
*NL*
manner
,
a
man
of
talent
,
and
of
great
antiquarian
erudition
,
limited
the
*NL*
popularity
of
his
work
,
by
excluding
from
it
every
thing
which
was
not
*NL*
sufficiently
obsolete
to
be
altogether
forgotten
and
unintelligible
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
license
which
I
would
here
vindicate
,
is
so
necessary
to
the
*NL*
execution
of
my
plan
,
that
I
will
crave
your
patience
while
I
illustrate
*NL*
my
argument
a
little
farther
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
who
first
opens
Chaucer
,
or
any
other
ancient
poet
,
is
so
much
*NL*
struck
with
the
obsolete
spelling
,
multiplied
consonants
,
and
antiquated
*NL*
appearance
of
the
language
,
that
he
is
apt
to
lay
the
work
down
in
*NL*
despair
,
as
encrusted
too
deep
with
the
rust
of
antiquity
,
to
permit
his
*NL*
judging
of
its
merits
or
tasting
its
beauties
.
But
if
some
intelligent
*NL*
and
accomplished
friend
points
out
to
him
,
that
the
difficulties
by
*NL*
which
he
is
startled
are
more
in
appearance
than
reality
,
if
,
by
*NL*
reading
aloud
to
him
,
or
by
reducing
the
ordinary
words
to
the
modern
*NL*
orthography
,
he
satisfies
his
proselyte
that
only
about
one-tenth
part
*NL*
of
the
words
employed
are
in
fact
obsolete
,
the
novice
may
be
easily
*NL*
persuaded
to
approach
the
``
well
of
English
undefiled
,
''
with
the
*NL*
certainty
that
a
slender
degree
of
patience
will
enable
him
to
to
enjoy
*NL*
both
the
humour
and
the
pathos
with
which
old
Geoffrey
delighted
the
age
*NL*
of
Cressy
and
of
Poictiers
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
pursue
this
a
little
farther
.
If
our
neophyte
,
strong
in
the
new-born
*NL*
love
of
antiquity
,
were
to
undertake
to
imitate
what
he
had
learnt
to
*NL*
admire
,
it
must
be
allowed
he
would
act
very
injudiciously
,
if
he
were
*NL*
to
select
from
the
Glossary
the
obsolete
words
which
it
contains
,
and
*NL*
employ
those
exclusively
of
all
phrases
and
vocables
retained
in
modern
*NL*
days
.
This
was
the
error
of
the
unfortunate
Chatterton
.
In
order
to
give
*NL*
his
language
the
appearance
of
antiquity
,
he
rejected
every
word
that
*NL*
was
modern
,
and
produced
a
dialect
entirely
different
from
any
that
*NL*
had
ever
been
spoken
in
Great
Britain
.
He
who
would
imitate
an
ancient
*NL*
language
with
success
,
must
attend
rather
to
its
grammatical
character
,
*NL*
turn
of
expression
,
and
mode
of
arrangement
,
than
labour
to
collect
*NL*
extraordinary
and
antiquated
terms
,
which
,
as
I
have
already
averred
,
do
*NL*
not
in
ancient
authors
approach
the
number
of
words
still
in
use
,
though
*NL*
perhaps
somewhat
altered
in
sense
and
spelling
,
in
the
proportion
of
one
*NL*
to
ten
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
I
have
applied
to
language
,
is
still
more
justly
applicable
to
*NL*
sentiments
and
manners
.
The
passions
,
the
sources
from
which
these
must
*NL*
spring
in
all
their
modifications
,
are
generally
the
same
in
all
ranks
*NL*
and
conditions
,
all
countries
and
ages
;
and
it
follows
,
as
a
matter
*NL*
of
course
,
that
the
opinions
,
habits
of
thinking
,
and
actions
,
however
*NL*
influenced
by
the
peculiar
state
of
society
,
must
still
,
upon
the
whole
,
*NL*
bear
a
strong
resemblance
to
each
other
.
Our
ancestors
were
not
more
*NL*
distinct
from
us
,
surely
,
than
Jews
are
from
Christians
;
they
had
``
eyes
,
*NL*
hands
,
organs
,
dimensions
,
senses
,
affections
,
passions
;
''
were
``
fed
with
*NL*
the
same
food
,
hurt
with
the
same
weapons
,
subject
to
the
same
diseases
,
*NL*
warmed
and
cooled
by
the
same
winter
and
summer
,
''
as
ourselves
.
The
*NL*
tenor
,
therefore
,
of
their
affections
and
feelings
,
must
have
borne
the
*NL*
same
general
proportion
to
our
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
follows
,
therefore
,
that
of
the
materials
which
an
author
has
to
*NL*
use
in
a
romance
,
or
fictitious
composition
,
such
as
I
have
ventured
*NL*
to
attempt
,
he
will
find
that
a
great
proportion
,
both
of
language
and
*NL*
manners
,
is
as
proper
to
the
present
time
as
to
those
in
which
he
has
*NL*
laid
his
time
of
action
.
The
freedom
of
choice
which
this
allows
him
,
*NL*
is
therefore
much
greater
,
and
the
difficulty
of
his
task
much
more
*NL*
diminished
,
than
at
first
appears
.
To
take
an
illustration
from
a
sister
*NL*
art
,
the
antiquarian
details
may
be
said
to
represent
the
peculiar
*NL*
features
of
a
landscape
under
delineation
of
the
pencil
.
His
feudal
*NL*
tower
must
arise
in
due
majesty
;
the
figures
which
he
introduces
must
*NL*
have
the
costume
and
character
of
their
age
;
the
piece
must
represent
*NL*
the
peculiar
features
of
the
scene
which
he
has
chosen
for
his
subject
,
*NL*
with
all
its
appropriate
elevation
of
rock
,
or
precipitate
descent
of
*NL*
cataract
.
His
general
colouring
,
too
,
must
be
copied
from
Nature
:
The
*NL*
sky
must
be
clouded
or
serene
,
according
to
the
climate
,
and
the
general
*NL*
tints
must
be
those
which
prevail
in
a
natural
landscape
.
So
far
the
*NL*
painter
is
bound
down
by
the
rules
of
his
art
,
to
a
precise
imitation
of
*NL*
the
features
of
Nature
;
but
it
is
not
required
that
he
should
descend
to
*NL*
copy
all
her
more
minute
features
,
or
represent
with
absolute
exactness
*NL*
the
very
herbs
,
flowers
,
and
trees
,
with
which
the
spot
is
decorated
.
*NL*
These
,
as
well
as
all
the
more
minute
points
of
light
and
shadow
,
are
*NL*
attributes
proper
to
scenery
in
general
,
natural
to
each
situation
,
and
*NL*
subject
to
the
artist
's
disposal
,
as
his
taste
or
pleasure
may
dictate
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
true
,
that
this
license
is
confined
in
either
case
within
*NL*
legitimate
bounds
.
The
painter
must
introduce
no
ornament
inconsistent
*NL*
with
the
climate
or
country
of
his
landscape
;
he
must
not
plant
cypress
*NL*
trees
upon
Inch-Merrin
,
or
Scottish
firs
among
the
ruins
of
Persepolis
;
*NL*
and
the
author
lies
under
a
corresponding
restraint
.
However
far
he
may
*NL*
venture
in
a
more
full
detail
of
passions
and
feelings
,
than
is
to
be
*NL*
found
in
the
ancient
compositions
which
he
imitates
,
he
must
introduce
*NL*
nothing
inconsistent
with
the
manners
of
the
age
;
his
knights
,
squires
,
*NL*
grooms
,
and
yeomen
,
may
be
more
fully
drawn
than
in
the
hard
,
dry
*NL*
delineations
of
an
ancient
illuminated
manuscript
,
but
the
character
and
*NL*
costume
of
the
age
must
remain
inviolate
;
they
must
be
the
same
figures
,
*NL*
drawn
by
a
better
pencil
,
or
,
to
speak
more
modestly
,
executed
in
an
age
*NL*
when
the
principles
of
art
were
better
understood
.
His
language
must
*NL*
not
be
exclusively
obsolete
and
unintelligible
;
but
he
should
admit
,
if
*NL*
possible
,
no
word
or
turn
of
phraseology
betraying
an
origin
directly
*NL*
modern
.
It
is
one
thing
to
make
use
of
the
language
and
sentiments
which
*NL*
are
common
to
ourselves
and
our
forefathers
,
and
it
is
another
to
*NL*
invest
them
with
the
sentiments
and
dialect
exclusively
proper
to
their
*NL*
descendants
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
,
my
dear
friend
,
I
have
found
the
most
difficult
part
of
my
task
;
*NL*
and
,
to
speak
frankly
,
I
hardly
expect
to
satisfy
your
less
partial
*NL*
judgment
,
and
more
extensive
knowledge
of
such
subjects
,
since
I
have
*NL*
hardly
been
able
to
please
my
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
conscious
that
I
shall
be
found
still
more
faulty
in
the
tone
of
*NL*
keeping
and
costume
,
by
those
who
may
be
disposed
rigidly
to
examine
*NL*
my
Tale
,
with
reference
to
the
manners
of
the
exact
period
in
which
my
*NL*
actors
flourished
:
It
may
be
,
that
I
have
introduced
little
which
can
*NL*
positively
be
termed
modern
;
but
,
on
the
other
hand
,
it
is
extremely
*NL*
probable
that
I
may
have
confused
the
manners
of
two
or
three
centuries
,
*NL*
and
introduced
,
during
the
reign
of
Richard
the
First
,
circumstances
*NL*
appropriated
to
a
period
either
considerably
earlier
,
or
a
good
deal
*NL*
later
than
that
era
.
It
is
my
comfort
,
that
errors
of
this
kind
will
*NL*
escape
the
general
class
of
readers
,
and
that
I
may
share
in
the
*NL*
ill-deserved
applause
of
those
architects
,
who
,
in
their
modern
Gothic
,
*NL*
do
not
hesitate
to
introduce
,
without
rule
or
method
,
ornaments
proper
*NL*
to
different
styles
and
to
different
periods
of
the
art
.
Those
*NL*
whose
extensive
researches
have
given
them
the
means
of
judging
my
*NL*
backslidings
with
more
severity
,
will
probably
be
lenient
in
proportion
*NL*
to
their
knowledge
of
the
difficulty
of
my
task
.
My
honest
and
neglected
*NL*
friend
,
Ingulphus
,
has
furnished
me
with
many
a
valuable
hint
;
but
the
*NL*
light
afforded
by
the
Monk
of
Croydon
,
and
Geoffrey
de
Vinsauff
,
is
*NL*
dimmed
by
such
a
conglomeration
of
uninteresting
and
unintelligible
*NL*
matter
,
that
we
gladly
fly
for
relief
to
the
delightful
pages
of
the
*NL*
gallant
Froissart
,
although
he
flourished
at
a
period
so
much
more
*NL*
remote
from
the
date
of
my
history
.
If
,
therefore
,
my
dear
friend
,
you
*NL*
have
generosity
enough
to
pardon
the
presumptuous
attempt
,
to
frame
for
*NL*
myself
a
minstrel
coronet
,
partly
out
of
the
pearls
of
pure
antiquity
,
*NL*
and
partly
from
the
Bristol
stones
and
paste
,
with
which
I
have
*NL*
endeavoured
to
imitate
them
,
I
am
convinced
your
opinion
of
the
*NL*
difficulty
of
the
task
will
reconcile
you
to
the
imperfect
manner
of
its
*NL*
execution
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
my
materials
I
have
but
little
to
say
.
They
may
be
chiefly
found
in
*NL*
the
singular
Anglo-Norman
MS.
,
which
Sir
Arthur
Wardour
preserves
with
*NL*
such
jealous
care
in
the
third
drawer
of
his
oaken
cabinet
,
scarcely
*NL*
allowing
any
one
to
touch
it
,
and
being
himself
not
able
to
read
one
*NL*
syllable
of
its
contents
.
I
should
never
have
got
his
consent
,
on
my
*NL*
visit
to
Scotland
,
to
read
in
those
precious
pages
for
so
many
hours
,
*NL*
had
I
not
promised
to
designate
it
by
some
emphatic
mode
of
printing
,
*NL*
as
-LCB-
The
Wardour
Manuscript
-RCB-
;
giving
it
,
thereby
,
an
individuality
*NL*
as
important
as
the
Bannatyne
MS.
,
the
Auchinleck
MS.
,
and
any
other
*NL*
monument
of
the
patience
of
a
Gothic
scrivener
.
I
have
sent
,
for
your
*NL*
private
consideration
,
a
list
of
the
contents
of
this
curious
piece
,
*NL*
which
I
shall
perhaps
subjoin
,
with
your
approbation
,
to
the
third
*NL*
volume
of
my
Tale
,
in
case
the
printer
's
devil
should
continue
impatient
*NL*
for
copy
,
when
the
whole
of
my
narrative
has
been
imposed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Adieu
,
my
dear
friend
;
I
have
said
enough
to
explain
,
if
not
to
*NL*
vindicate
,
the
attempt
which
I
have
made
,
and
which
,
in
spite
of
your
*NL*
doubts
,
and
my
own
incapacity
,
I
am
still
willing
to
believe
has
not
*NL*
been
altogether
made
in
vain
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
hope
you
are
now
well
recovered
from
your
spring
fit
of
the
gout
,
and
*NL*
shall
be
happy
if
the
advice
of
your
learned
physician
should
recommend
*NL*
a
tour
to
these
parts
.
Several
curiosities
have
been
lately
dug
up
near
*NL*
the
wall
,
as
well
as
at
the
ancient
station
of
Habitancum
.
Talking
of
*NL*
the
latter
,
I
suppose
you
have
long
since
heard
the
news
,
that
a
sulky
*NL*
churlish
boor
has
destroyed
the
ancient
statue
,
or
rather
bas-relief
,
*NL*
popularly
called
Robin
of
Redesdale
.
It
seems
Robin
's
fame
attracted
*NL*
more
visitants
than
was
consistent
with
the
growth
of
the
heather
,
upon
*NL*
a
moor
worth
a
shilling
an
acre
.
Reverend
as
you
write
yourself
,
be
*NL*
revengeful
for
once
,
and
pray
with
me
that
he
may
be
visited
with
such
*NL*
a
fit
of
the
stone
,
as
if
he
had
all
the
fragments
of
poor
Robin
in
that
*NL*
region
of
his
viscera
where
the
disease
holds
its
seat
.
Tell
this
not
in
*NL*
Gath
,
lest
the
Scots
rejoice
that
they
have
at
length
found
a
parallel
*NL*
instance
among
their
neighbours
,
to
that
barbarous
deed
which
demolished
*NL*
Arthur
's
Oven
.
But
there
is
no
end
to
lamentation
,
when
we
betake
*NL*
ourselves
to
such
subjects
.
My
respectful
compliments
attend
Miss
*NL*
Dryasdust
;
I
endeavoured
to
match
the
spectacles
agreeable
to
her
*NL*
commission
,
during
my
late
journey
to
London
,
and
hope
she
has
received
*NL*
them
safe
,
and
found
them
satisfactory
.
I
send
this
by
the
blind
*NL*
carrier
,
so
that
probably
it
may
be
some
time
upon
its
journey
.

Pope

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
that
pleasant
district
of
merry
England
which
is
watered
by
the
*NL*
river
Don
,
there
extended
in
ancient
times
a
large
forest
,
covering
*NL*
the
greater
part
of
the
beautiful
hills
and
valleys
which
lie
between
*NL*
Sheffield
and
the
pleasant
town
of
Doncaster
.
The
remains
of
this
*NL*
extensive
wood
are
still
to
be
seen
at
the
noble
seats
of
Wentworth
,
of
*NL*
Warncliffe
Park
,
and
around
Rotherham
.
Here
haunted
of
yore
the
fabulous
*NL*
Dragon
of
Wantley
;
here
were
fought
many
of
the
most
desperate
battles
*NL*
during
the
Civil
Wars
of
the
Roses
;
and
here
also
flourished
in
ancient
*NL*
times
those
bands
of
gallant
outlaws
,
whose
deeds
have
been
rendered
so
*NL*
popular
in
English
song

Such
being

a
period
*NL*
towards
the
end
of
the
reign
of
Richard
I.
,
when
his
return
from
his
*NL*
long
captivity
had
become
an
event
rather
wished
than
hoped
for
by
his
*NL*
despairing
subjects
,
who
were
in
the
meantime
subjected
to
every
species
*NL*
of
subordinate
oppression
.
The
nobles
,
whose
power
had
become
exorbitant
*NL*
during
the
reign
of
Stephen
,
and
whom
the
prudence
of
Henry
the
Second
*NL*
had
scarce
reduced
to
some
degree
of
subjection
to
the
crown
,
had
now
*NL*
resumed
their
ancient
license
in
its
utmost
extent
;
despising
the
feeble
*NL*
interference
of
the
English
Council
of
State
,
fortifying
their
castles
,
*NL*
increasing
the
number
of
their
dependants
,
reducing
all
around
them
to
a
*NL*
state
of
vassalage
,
and
striving
by
every
means
in
their
power
,
to
place
*NL*
themselves
each
at
the
head
of
such
forces
as
might
enable
him
to
make
a
*NL*
figure
in
the
national
convulsions
which
appeared
to
be
impending
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
situation
of
the
inferior
gentry
,
or
Franklins
,
as
they
were
called
,
*NL*
who
,
by
the
law
and
spirit
of
the
English
constitution
,
were
entitled
*NL*
to
hold
themselves
independent
of
feudal
tyranny
,
became
now
unusually
*NL*
precarious
.
If
,
as
was
most
generally
the
case
,
they
placed
themselves
*NL*
under
the
protection
of
any
of
the
petty
kings
in
their
vicinity
,
*NL*
accepted
of
feudal
offices
in
his
household
,
or
bound
themselves
by
*NL*
mutual
treaties
of
alliance
and
protection
,
to
support
him
in
his
*NL*
enterprises
,
they
might
indeed
purchase
temporary
repose
;
but
it
must
*NL*
be
with
the
sacrifice
of
that
independence
which
was
so
dear
to
every
*NL*
English
bosom
,
and
at
the
certain
hazard
of
being
involved
as
a
party
in
*NL*
whatever
rash
expedition
the
ambition
of
their
protector
might
lead
him
*NL*
to
undertake
.
On
the
other
hand
,
such
and
so
multiplied
were
the
means
*NL*
of
vexation
and
oppression
possessed
by
the
great
Barons
,
that
they
*NL*
never
wanted
the
pretext
,
and
seldom
the
will
,
to
harass
and
pursue
,
*NL*
even
to
the
very
edge
of
destruction
,
any
of
their
less
powerful
*NL*
neighbours
,
who
attempted
to
separate
themselves
from
their
authority
,
*NL*
and
to
trust
for
their
protection
,
during
the
dangers
of
the
times
,
to
*NL*
their
own
inoffensive
conduct
,
and
to
the
laws
of
the
land
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
circumstance
which
greatly
tended
to
enhance
the
tyranny
of
the
*NL*
nobility
,
and
the
sufferings
of
the
inferior
classes
,
arose
from
*NL*
the
consequences
of
the
Conquest
by
Duke
William
of
Normandy
.
Four
*NL*
generations
had
not
sufficed
to
blend
the
hostile
blood
of
the
Normans
*NL*
and
Anglo-Saxons
,
or
to
unite
,
by
common
language
and
mutual
interests
,
*NL*
two
hostile
races
,
one
of
which
still
felt
the
elation
of
triumph
,
while
*NL*
the
other
groaned
under
all
the
consequences
of
defeat
.
The
power
had
*NL*
been
completely
placed
in
the
hands
of
the
Norman
nobility
,
by
the
event
*NL*
of
the
battle
of
Hastings
,
and
it
had
been
used
,
as
our
histories
assure
*NL*
us
,
with
no
moderate
hand
.
The
whole
race
of
Saxon
princes
and
nobles
*NL*
had
been
extirpated
or
disinherited
,
with
few
or
no
exceptions
;
nor
were
*NL*
the
numbers
great
who
possessed
land
in
the
country
of
their
fathers
,
*NL*
even
as
proprietors
of
the
second
,
or
of
yet
inferior
classes
.
The
royal
*NL*
policy
had
long
been
to
weaken
,
by
every
means
,
legal
or
illegal
,
the
*NL*
strength
of
a
part
of
the
population
which
was
justly
considered
as
*NL*
nourishing
the
most
inveterate
antipathy
to
their
victor
.
All
the
*NL*
monarchs
of
the
Norman
race
had
shown
the
most
marked
predilection
for
*NL*
their
Norman
subjects
;
the
laws
of
the
chase
,
and
many
others
equally
*NL*
unknown
to
the
milder
and
more
free
spirit
of
the
Saxon
constitution
,
*NL*
had
been
fixed
upon
the
necks
of
the
subjugated
inhabitants
,
to
add
*NL*
weight
,
as
it
were
,
to
the
feudal
chains
with
which
they
were
loaded
.
At
*NL*
court
,
and
in
the
castles
of
the
great
nobles
,
where
the
pomp
and
state
*NL*
of
a
court
was
emulated
,
Norman-French
was
the
only
language
employed
;
*NL*
in
courts
of
law
,
the
pleadings
and
judgments
were
delivered
in
the
same
*NL*
tongue
.
In
short
,
French
was
the
language
of
honour
,
of
chivalry
,
and
*NL*
even
of
justice
,
while
the
far
more
manly
and
expressive
Anglo-Saxon
*NL*
was
abandoned
to
the
use
of
rustics
and
hinds
,
who
knew
no
other
.
Still
,
*NL*
however
,
the
necessary
intercourse
between
the
lords
of
the
soil
,
*NL*
and
those
oppressed
inferior
beings
by
whom
that
soil
was
cultivated
,
*NL*
occasioned
the
gradual
formation
of
a
dialect
,
compounded
betwixt
*NL*
the
French
and
the
Anglo-Saxon
,
in
which
they
could
render
themselves
*NL*
mutually
intelligible
to
each
other
;
and
from
this
necessity
arose
by
*NL*
degrees
the
structure
of
our
present
English
language
,
in
which
the
*NL*
speech
of
the
victors
and
the
vanquished
have
been
so
happily
blended
*NL*
together
;
and
which
has
since
been
so
richly
improved
by
importations
*NL*
from
the
classical
languages
,
and
from
those
spoken
by
the
southern
*NL*
nations
of
Europe
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
state
of
things
I
have
thought
it
necessary
to
premise
for
the
*NL*
information
of
the
general
reader
,
who
might
be
apt
to
forget
,
that
,
*NL*
although
no
great
historical
events
,
such
as
war
or
insurrection
,
mark
*NL*
the
existence
of
the
Anglo-Saxons
as
a
separate
people
subsequent
to
the
*NL*
reign
of
William
the
Second
;
yet
the
great
national
distinctions
betwixt
*NL*
them
and
their
conquerors
,
the
recollection
of
what
they
had
formerly
*NL*
been
,
and
to
what
they
were
now
reduced
,
continued
down
to
the
reign
*NL*
of
Edward
the
Third
,
to
keep
open
the
wounds
which
the
Conquest
had
*NL*
inflicted
,
and
to
maintain
a
line
of
separation
betwixt
the
descendants
*NL*
of
the
victor
Normans
and
the
vanquished
Saxons
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
was
setting
upon
one
of
the
rich
grassy
glades
of
that
forest
,
*NL*
which
we
have
mentioned
in
the
beginning
of
the
chapter
.
Hundreds
of
*NL*
broad-headed
,
short-stemmed
,
wide-branched
oaks
,
which
had
witnessed
*NL*
perhaps
the
stately
march
of
the
Roman
soldiery
,
flung
their
gnarled
*NL*
arms
over
a
thick
carpet
of
the
most
delicious
green
sward
;
in
some
*NL*
places
they
were
intermingled
with
beeches
,
hollies
,
and
copsewood
of
*NL*
various
descriptions
,
so
closely
as
totally
to
intercept
the
level
beams
*NL*
of
the
sinking
sun
;
in
others
they
receded
from
each
other
,
forming
*NL*
those
long
sweeping
vistas
,
in
the
intricacy
of
which
the
eye
delights
*NL*
to
lose
itself
,
while
imagination
considers
them
as
the
paths
to
yet
*NL*
wilder
scenes
of
silvan
solitude
.
Here
the
red
rays
of
the
sun
shot
a
*NL*
broken
and
discoloured
light
,
that
partially
hung
upon
the
shattered
*NL*
boughs
and
mossy
trunks
of
the
trees
,
and
there
they
illuminated
in
*NL*
brilliant
patches
the
portions
of
turf
to
which
they
made
their
way
.
A
*NL*
considerable
open
space
,
in
the
midst
of
this
glade
,
seemed
formerly
to
*NL*
have
been
dedicated
to
the
rites
of
Druidical
superstition
;
for
,
on
*NL*
the
summit
of
a
hillock
,
so
regular
as
to
seem
artificial
,
there
still
*NL*
remained
part
of
a
circle
of
rough
unhewn
stones
,
of
large
dimensions
.
*NL*
Seven
stood
upright
;
the
rest
had
been
dislodged
from
their
places
,
*NL*
probably
by
the
zeal
of
some
convert
to
Christianity
,
and
lay
,
some
*NL*
prostrate
near
their
former
site
,
and
others
on
the
side
of
the
hill
.
*NL*
One
large
stone
only
had
found
its
way
to
the
bottom
,
and
in
stopping
*NL*
the
course
of
a
small
brook
,
which
glided
smoothly
round
the
foot
of
*NL*
the
eminence
,
gave
,
by
its
opposition
,
a
feeble
voice
of
murmur
to
the
*NL*
placid
and
elsewhere
silent
streamlet
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
human
figures
which
completed
this
landscape
,
were
in
number
two
,
*NL*
partaking
,
in
their
dress
and
appearance
,
of
that
wild
and
rustic
*NL*
character
,
which
belonged
to
the
woodlands
of
the
West-Riding
of
*NL*
Yorkshire
at
that
early
period
.
The
eldest
of
these
men
had
a
*NL*
stern
,
savage
,
and
wild
aspect
.
His
garment
was
of
the
simplest
form
*NL*
imaginable
,
being
a
close
jacket
with
sleeves
,
composed
of
the
tanned
*NL*
skin
of
some
animal
,
on
which
the
hair
had
been
originally
left
,
but
*NL*
which
had
been
worn
off
in
so
many
places
,
that
it
would
have
been
*NL*
difficult
to
distinguish
from
the
patches
that
remained
,
to
what
*NL*
creature
the
fur
had
belonged
.
This
primeval
vestment
reached
from
*NL*
the
throat
to
the
knees
,
and
served
at
once
all
the
usual
purposes
*NL*
of
body-clothing
;
there
was
no
wider
opening
at
the
collar
,
than
*NL*
was
necessary
to
admit
the
passage
of
the
head
,
from
which
it
may
be
*NL*
inferred
,
that
it
was
put
on
by
slipping
it
over
the
head
and
shoulders
,
*NL*
in
the
manner
of
a
modern
shirt
,
or
ancient
hauberk
.
Sandals
,
bound
*NL*
with
thongs
made
of
boars
'
hide
,
protected
the
feet
,
and
a
roll
of
thin
*NL*
leather
was
twined
artificially
round
the
legs
,
and
,
ascending
above
the
*NL*
calf
,
left
the
knees
bare
,
like
those
of
a
Scottish
Highlander
.
To
make
*NL*
the
jacket
sit
yet
more
close
to
the
body
,
it
was
gathered
at
the
middle
*NL*
by
a
broad
leathern
belt
,
secured
by
a
brass
buckle
;
to
one
side
of
*NL*
which
was
attached
a
sort
of
scrip
,
and
to
the
other
a
ram
's
horn
,
*NL*
accoutred
with
a
mouthpiece
,
for
the
purpose
of
blowing
.
In
the
same
*NL*
belt
was
stuck
one
of
those
long
,
broad
,
sharp-pointed
,
and
two-edged
*NL*
knives
,
with
a
buck
's
-
horn
handle
,
which
were
fabricated
in
the
*NL*
neighbourhood
,
and
bore
even
at
this
early
period
the
name
of
a
*NL*
Sheffield
whittle
.
The
man
had
no
covering
upon
his
head
,
which
was
*NL*
only
defended
by
his
own
thick
hair
,
matted
and
twisted
together
,
and
*NL*
scorched
by
the
influence
of
the
sun
into
a
rusty
dark-red
colour
,
*NL*
forming
a
contrast
with
the
overgrown
beard
upon
his
cheeks
,
which
was
*NL*
rather
of
a
yellow
or
amber
hue
.
One
part
of
his
dress
only
remains
,
but
*NL*
it
is
too
remarkable
to
be
suppressed
;
it
was
a
brass
ring
,
resembling
a
*NL*
dog
's
collar
,
but
without
any
opening
,
and
soldered
fast
round
his
neck
,
*NL*
so
loose
as
to
form
no
impediment
to
his
breathing
,
yet
so
tight
as
to
*NL*
be
incapable
of
being
removed
,
excepting
by
the
use
of
the
file
.
On
this
*NL*
singular
gorget
was
engraved
,
in
Saxon
characters
,
an
inscription
of
the
*NL*
following
purport
:
--
``
Gurth
,
the
son
of
Beowulph
,
is
the
born
thrall
of
*NL*
Cedric
of
Rotherwood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Beside
the
swine-herd
,
for
such
was
Gurth
's
occupation
,
was
seated
,
upon
*NL*
one
of
the
fallen
Druidical
monuments
,
a
person
about
ten
years
younger
*NL*
in
appearance
,
and
whose
dress
,
though
resembling
his
companion
's
in
*NL*
form
,
was
of
better
materials
,
and
of
a
more
fantastic
appearance
.
His
*NL*
jacket
had
been
stained
of
a
bright
purple
hue
,
upon
which
there
had
*NL*
been
some
attempt
to
paint
grotesque
ornaments
in
different
colours
.
To
*NL*
the
jacket
he
added
a
short
cloak
,
which
scarcely
reached
half
way
down
*NL*
his
thigh
;
it
was
of
crimson
cloth
,
though
a
good
deal
soiled
,
lined
*NL*
with
bright
yellow
;
and
as
he
could
transfer
it
from
one
shoulder
to
the
*NL*
other
,
or
at
his
pleasure
draw
it
all
around
him
,
its
width
,
contrasted
*NL*
with
its
want
of
longitude
,
formed
a
fantastic
piece
of
drapery
.
He
had
*NL*
thin
silver
bracelets
upon
his
arms
,
and
on
his
neck
a
collar
of
the
*NL*
same
metal
bearing
the
inscription
,
``
Wamba
,
the
son
of
Witless
,
is
the
*NL*
thrall
of
Cedric
of
Rotherwood
.
''
This
personage
had
the
same
sort
of
*NL*
sandals
with
his
companion
,
but
instead
of
the
roll
of
leather
thong
,
*NL*
his
legs
were
cased
in
a
sort
of
gaiters
,
of
which
one
was
red
and
the
*NL*
other
yellow
.
He
was
provided
also
with
a
cap
,
having
around
it
more
*NL*
than
one
bell
,
about
the
size
of
those
attached
to
hawks
,
which
jingled
*NL*
as
he
turned
his
head
to
one
side
or
other
;
and
as
he
seldom
remained
a
*NL*
minute
in
the
same
posture
,
the
sound
might
be
considered
as
incessant
.
*NL*
Around
the
edge
of
this
cap
was
a
stiff
bandeau
of
leather
,
cut
at
the
*NL*
top
into
open
work
,
resembling
a
coronet
,
while
a
prolonged
bag
arose
*NL*
from
within
it
,
and
fell
down
on
one
shoulder
like
an
old-fashioned
*NL*
nightcap
,
or
a
jelly-bag
,
or
the
head-gear
of
a
modern
hussar
.
It
was
to
*NL*
this
part
of
the
cap
that
the
bells
were
attached
;
which
circumstance
,
*NL*
as
well
as
the
shape
of
his
head-dress
,
and
his
own
half-crazed
,
*NL*
half-cunning
expression
of
countenance
,
sufficiently
pointed
him
out
as
*NL*
belonging
to
the
race
of
domestic
clowns
or
jesters
,
maintained
in
the
*NL*
houses
of
the
wealthy
,
to
help
away
the
tedium
of
those
lingering
*NL*
hours
which
they
were
obliged
to
spend
within
doors
.
He
bore
,
like
*NL*
his
companion
,
a
scrip
,
attached
to
his
belt
,
but
had
neither
horn
nor
*NL*
knife
,
being
probably
considered
as
belonging
to
a
class
whom
it
is
*NL*
esteemed
dangerous
to
intrust
with
edge-tools
.
In
place
of
these
,
he
*NL*
was
equipped
with
a
sword
of
lath
,
resembling
that
with
which
Harlequin
*NL*
operates
his
wonders
upon
the
modern
stage
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
outward
appearance
of
these
two
men
formed
scarce
a
stronger
*NL*
contrast
than
their
look
and
demeanour
.
That
of
the
serf
,
or
bondsman
,
*NL*
was
sad
and
sullen
;
his
aspect
was
bent
on
the
ground
with
an
appearance
*NL*
of
deep
dejection
,
which
might
be
almost
construed
into
apathy
,
had
*NL*
not
the
fire
which
occasionally
sparkled
in
his
red
eye
manifested
that
*NL*
there
slumbered
,
under
the
appearance
of
sullen
despondency
,
a
sense
of
*NL*
oppression
,
and
a
disposition
to
resistance
.
The
looks
of
Wamba
,
on
*NL*
the
other
hand
,
indicated
,
as
usual
with
his
class
,
a
sort
of
vacant
*NL*
curiosity
,
and
fidgetty
impatience
of
any
posture
of
repose
,
together
*NL*
with
the
utmost
self-satisfaction
respecting
his
own
situation
,
and
the
*NL*
appearance
which
he
made
.
The
dialogue
which
they
maintained
between
*NL*
them
,
was
carried
on
in
Anglo-Saxon
,
which
,
as
we
said
before
,
was
*NL*
universally
spoken
by
the
inferior
classes
,
excepting
the
Norman
*NL*
soldiers
,
and
the
immediate
personal
dependants
of
the
great
feudal
*NL*
nobles
.
But
to
give
their
conversation
in
the
original
would
convey
but
*NL*
little
information
to
the
modern
reader
,
for
whose
benefit
we
beg
to
*NL*
offer
the
following
translation
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
curse
of
St
Withold
upon
these
infernal
porkers
!
''
said
the
*NL*
swine-herd
,
after
blowing
his
horn
obstreperously
,
to
collect
together
*NL*
the
scattered
herd
of
swine
,
which
,
answering
his
call
with
notes
*NL*
equally
melodious
,
made
,
however
,
no
haste
to
remove
themselves
from
the
*NL*
luxurious
banquet
of
beech-mast
and
acorns
on
which
they
had
fattened
,
*NL*
or
to
forsake
the
marshy
banks
of
the
rivulet
,
where
several
of
them
,
*NL*
half
plunged
in
mud
,
lay
stretched
at
their
ease
,
altogether
regardless
*NL*
of
the
voice
of
their
keeper
.
``
The
curse
of
St
Withold
upon
them
and
*NL*
upon
me
!
''
said
Gurth
;
``
if
the
two-legged
wolf
snap
not
up
some
of
them
*NL*
ere
nightfall
,
I
am
no
true
man
.
Here
,
Fangs
!
Fangs
!
''
he
ejaculated
at
*NL*
the
top
of
his
voice
to
a
ragged
wolfish-looking
dog
,
a
sort
of
lurcher
,
*NL*
half
mastiff
,
half
greyhound
,
which
ran
limping
about
as
if
with
the
*NL*
purpose
of
seconding
his
master
in
collecting
the
refractory
grunters
;
*NL*
but
which
,
in
fact
,
from
misapprehension
of
the
swine-herd
's
signals
,
*NL*
ignorance
of
his
own
duty
,
or
malice
prepense
,
only
drove
them
hither
*NL*
and
thither
,
and
increased
the
evil
which
he
seemed
to
design
to
remedy
.
*NL*
``
A
devil
draw
the
teeth
of
him
,
''
said
Gurth
,
``
and
the
mother
of
mischief
*NL*
confound
the
Ranger

without

``
I

*NL*
*NL*

he
said
,
listening
to
the
trampling
of
several
horses
which
*NL*
became
then
audible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
whom

answered
Gurth
,
who
had
now
got
his
herd
before
him
,
*NL*
and
,
with
the
aid
of
Fangs
,
was
driving
them
down
one
of
the
long
dim
*NL*
vistas
which
we
have
endeavoured
to
describe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
but
I
must
see
the
riders
,
''
answered
Wamba
;
``
perhaps
they
are
come
*NL*
from
Fairy-land
with
a
message
from
King
Oberon

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
murrain
take
thee
,
''
rejoined
the
swine-herd
;
``
wilt
thou
talk
of
such
*NL*
things

while
a
terrible
storm
of
thunder
and
lightning
is
raging
within

a
few
miles
of
us
?
Hark
,
how
the
thunder
rumbles
!
and
for
summer
rain
,
*NL*
I
never
saw
such
broad
downright

drops
fall
out

;
the
*NL*
oaks

too
,
notwithstanding

creak
with

thou
wilt

us
home

will
be
fearful

*NL*
*NL*
Wamba
seemed
to
feel
the
force
of
this
appeal
,
and
accompanied
his
*NL*
companion
,
who
began
his
journey
after
catching
up
a
long
quarter-staff

lay
upon
the
grass
beside
him

strode
hastily

down

CHAPTER
II
*NL*
*NL*
A
Monk
there
was
,
a
fayre
for
the
maistrie
,
*NL*
An
outrider
that
loved
venerie
;
*NL*
A
manly
man
,
to
be
an
Abbot
able
,
*NL*
Full
many
a
daintie
horse
had
he
in

:
*NL*
And
whan
he
rode
,
men
might
his
bridle
hear
*NL*
Gingeling
in
a
whistling
wind
as
clear
,
*NL*
And
eke
as
loud
,
as
doth
the
chapell
bell
,
*NL*
There
as
this
lord
was
keeper
of
the
cell
.
*NL*
--
Chaucer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Notwithstanding
the
occasional
exhortation
and
chiding
of
his
companion
,
*NL*
the
noise
of
the
horsemen
's
feet
continuing
to
approach
,
Wamba
could
*NL*
not
be
prevented
from
lingering
occasionally
on
the
road
,
upon
every
*NL*
pretence
which
occurred
;
now
catching
from
the
hazel
a
cluster
of
*NL*
half-ripe
nuts
,
and
now
turning
his
head
to
leer
after
a
cottage
maiden
*NL*
who
crossed
their
path
.
The
horsemen
,
therefore
,
soon
overtook
them
on
*NL*
the
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
numbers
amounted
to
ten
men
,
of
whom
the
two
who
rode
foremost
*NL*
seemed
to
be
persons
of
considerable
importance
,
and
the
others
*NL*
their
attendants
.
It
was
not
difficult
to
ascertain
the
condition
and
*NL*
character
of
one
of
these
personages
.
He
was
obviously
an
ecclesiastic
*NL*
of
high
rank
;
his
dress
was
that
of
a
Cistercian
Monk
,
but
composed
of
*NL*
materials
much
finer
than
those
which
the
rule
of
that
order
admitted
.
*NL*
His
mantle
and
hood
were
of
the
best
Flanders
cloth
,
and
fell
in
ample
,
*NL*
and
not
ungraceful
folds
,
around
a
handsome
,
though
somewhat
corpulent
*NL*
person
.
His
countenance
bore
as
little
the
marks
of
self-denial
,
as
his
*NL*
habit
indicated
contempt
of
worldly
splendour
.
His
features
might
have
*NL*
been
called
good
,
had
there
not
lurked
under
the
pent-house
of
his
eye
,
*NL*
that
sly
epicurean
twinkle
which
indicates
the
cautious
voluptuary
.
*NL*
In
other
respects
,
his
profession
and
situation
had
taught
him
a
ready
*NL*
command
over
his
countenance
,
which
he
could
contract
at
pleasure
into
*NL*
solemnity
,
although
its
natural
expression
was
that
of
good-humoured
*NL*
social
indulgence
.
In
defiance
of
conventual
rules
,
and
the
edicts
of
*NL*
popes
and
councils
,
the
sleeves
of
this
dignitary
were
lined
and
turned
*NL*
up
with
rich
furs
,
his
mantle
secured
at
the
throat
with
a
golden
*NL*
clasp
,
and
the
whole
dress
proper
to
his
order
as
much
refined
upon
and
*NL*
ornamented
,
as
that
of
a
quaker
beauty
of
the
present
day
,
who
,
while
*NL*
she
retains
the
garb
and
costume
of
her
sect
continues
to
give
to
its
*NL*
simplicity
,
by
the
choice
of
materials
and
the
mode
of
disposing
them
,
*NL*
a
certain
air
of
coquettish
attraction
,
savouring
but
too
much
of
the
*NL*
vanities
of
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
worthy
churchman
rode
upon
a
well-fed
ambling
mule
,
whose
furniture
*NL*
was
highly
decorated
,
and
whose
bridle
,
according
to
the
fashion
of
the
*NL*
day
,
was
ornamented
with
silver
bells
.
In
his
seat
he
had
nothing
of
the
*NL*
awkwardness
of
the
convent
,
but
displayed
the
easy
and
habitual
grace
of
*NL*
a
well-trained
horseman
.
Indeed
,
it
seemed
that
so
humble
a
conveyance
*NL*
as
a
mule
,
in
however
good
case
,
and
however
well
broken
to
a
pleasant
*NL*
and
accommodating
amble
,
was
only
used
by
the
gallant
monk
for
*NL*
travelling
on
the
road
.
A
lay
brother
,
one
of
those
who
followed
in
the
*NL*
train
,
had
,
for
his
use
on
other
occasions
,
one
of
the
most
handsome
*NL*
Spanish
jennets
ever
bred
at
Andalusia
,
which
merchants
used
at
that
*NL*
time
to
import
,
with
great
trouble
and
risk
,
for
the
use
of
persons
of
*NL*
wealth
and
distinction
.
The
saddle
and
housings
of
this
superb
palfrey
*NL*
were
covered
by
a
long
foot-cloth
,
which
reached
nearly
to
the
ground
,
*NL*
and
on
which
were
richly
embroidered
,
mitres
,
crosses
,
and
other
*NL*
ecclesiastical
emblems
.
Another
lay
brother
led
a
sumpter
mule
,
loaded
*NL*
probably
with
his
superior
's
baggage
;
and
two
monks
of
his
own
order
,
*NL*
of
inferior
station
,
rode
together
in
the
rear
,
laughing
and
conversing
*NL*
with
each
other
,
without
taking
much
notice
of
the
other
members
of
the
*NL*
cavalcade
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
companion
of
the
church
dignitary
was
a
man
past
forty
,
thin
,
*NL*
strong
,
tall
,
and
muscular
;
an
athletic
figure
,
which
long
fatigue
and
*NL*
constant
exercise
seemed
to
have
left
none
of
the
softer
part
of
the
*NL*
human
form
,
having
reduced
the
whole
to
brawn
,
bones
,
and
sinews
,
which
*NL*
had
sustained
a
thousand
toils
,
and
were
ready
to
dare
a
thousand
more
.
*NL*
His
head
was
covered
with
a
scarlet
cap
,
faced
with
fur
--
of
that
kind
*NL*
which
the
French
call
``
mortier
''
,
from
its
resemblance
to
the
shape
of
an
*NL*
inverted
mortar
.
His
countenance
was
therefore
fully
displayed
,
and
its
*NL*
expression
was
calculated
to
impress
a
degree
of
awe
,
if
not
of
*NL*
fear
,
upon
strangers
.
High
features
,
naturally
strong
and
powerfully
*NL*
expressive
,
had
been
burnt
almost
into
Negro
blackness
by
constant
*NL*
exposure
to
the
tropical
sun
,
and
might
,
in
their
ordinary
state
,
be
*NL*
said
to
slumber
after
the
storm
of
passion
had
passed
away
;
but
the
*NL*
projection
of
the
veins
of
the
forehead
,
the
readiness
with
which
the
*NL*
upper
lip
and
its
thick
black
moustaches
quivered
upon
the
slightest
*NL*
emotion
,
plainly
intimated
that
the
tempest
might
be
again
and
easily
*NL*
awakened
.
His
keen
,
piercing
,
dark
eyes
,
told
in
every
glance
a
history
*NL*
of
difficulties
subdued
,
and
dangers
dared
,
and
seemed
to
challenge
*NL*
opposition
to
his
wishes
,
for
the
pleasure
of
sweeping
it
from
his
road
*NL*
by
a
determined
exertion
of
courage
and
of
will
;
a
deep
scar
on
his
brow
*NL*
gave
additional
sternness
to
his
countenance
,
and
a
sinister
expression
*NL*
to
one
of
his
eyes
,
which
had
been
slightly
injured
on
the
same
*NL*
occasion
,
and
of
which
the
vision
,
though
perfect
,
was
in
a
slight
and
*NL*
partial
degree
distorted
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
upper
dress
of
this
personage
resembled
that
of
his
companion
in
*NL*
shape
,
being
a
long
monastic
mantle
;
but
the
colour
,
being
scarlet
,
*NL*
showed
that
he
did
not
belong
to
any
of
the
four
regular
orders
of
*NL*
monks
.
On
the
right
shoulder
of
the
mantle
there
was
cut
,
in
white
*NL*
cloth
,
a
cross
of
a
peculiar
form
.
This
upper
robe
concealed
what
at
*NL*
first
view
seemed
rather
inconsistent
with
its
form
,
a
shirt
,
namely
,
of
*NL*
linked
mail
,
with
sleeves
and
gloves
of
the
same
,
curiously
plaited
and
*NL*
interwoven
,
as
flexible
to
the
body
as
those
which
are
now
wrought
in
*NL*
the
stocking-loom
,
out
of
less
obdurate
materials
.
The
fore-part
of
his
*NL*
thighs
,
where
the
folds
of
his
mantle
permitted
them
to
be
seen
,
were
*NL*
also
covered
with
linked
mail
;
the
knees
and
feet
were
defended
by
*NL*
splints
,
or
thin
plates
of
steel
,
ingeniously
jointed
upon
each
*NL*
other
;
and
mail
hose
,
reaching
from
the
ankle
to
the
knee
,
effectually
*NL*
protected
the
legs
,
and
completed
the
rider
's
defensive
armour
.
In
*NL*
his
girdle
he
wore
a
long
and
double-edged
dagger
,
which
was
the
only
*NL*
offensive
weapon
about
his
person
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
rode
,
not
a
mule
,
like
his
companion
,
but
a
strong
hackney
for
the
*NL*
road
,
to
save
his
gallant
war-horse
,
which
a
squire
led
behind
,
fully
*NL*
accoutred
for
battle
,
with
a
chamfron
or
plaited
head-piece
upon
his
*NL*
head
,
having
a
short
spike
projecting
from
the
front
.
On
one
side
of
the
*NL*
saddle
hung
a
short
battle-axe
,
richly
inlaid
with
Damascene
carving
;
*NL*
on
the
other
the
rider
's
plumed
head-piece
and
hood
of
mail
,
with
a
long
*NL*
two-handed
sword
,
used
by
the
chivalry
of
the
period
.
A
second
squire
*NL*
held
aloft
his
master
's
lance
,
from
the
extremity
of
which
fluttered
a
*NL*
small
banderole
,
or
streamer
,
bearing
a
cross
of
the
same
form
with
that
*NL*
embroidered
upon
his
cloak
.
He
also
carried
his
small
triangular
*NL*
shield
,
broad
enough
at
the
top
to
protect
the
breast
,
and
from
thence
*NL*
diminishing
to
a
point
.
It
was
covered
with
a
scarlet
cloth
,
which
*NL*
prevented
the
device
from
being
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
two
squires
were
followed
by
two
attendants
,
whose
dark
visages
,
*NL*
white
turbans
,
and
the
Oriental
form
of
their
garments
,
showed
them
to
*NL*
be
natives
of
some
distant
Eastern
country
.

The
whole
appearance
of
this
warrior
and
his
retinue
was
wild
and
*NL*
outlandish
;
the
dress
of
his
squires
was
gorgeous
,
and
his
Eastern
*NL*
attendants
wore
silver
collars
round
their
throats
,
and
bracelets
of
the
*NL*
same
metal
upon
their
swarthy
arms
and
legs
,
of
which
the
former
were
*NL*
naked
from
the
elbow
,
and
the
latter
from
mid-leg
to
ankle
.
Silk
and
*NL*
embroidery
distinguished
their
dresses
,
and
marked
the
wealth
and
*NL*
importance
of
their
master
;
forming
,
at
the
same
time
,
a
striking
*NL*
contrast
with
the
martial
simplicity
of
his
own
attire
.
They
were
armed
*NL*
with
crooked
sabres
,
having
the
hilt
and
baldric
inlaid
with
gold
,
and
*NL*
matched
with
Turkish
daggers
of
yet
more
costly
workmanship
.
Each
of
*NL*
them
bore
at
his
saddle-bow
a
bundle
of
darts
or
javelins
,
about
four
*NL*
feet
in
length
,
having
sharp
steel
heads
,
a
weapon
much
in
use
among
*NL*
the
Saracens
,
and
of
which
the
memory
is
yet
preserved
in
the
martial
*NL*
exercise
called
``
El
Jerrid
''
,
still
practised
in
the
Eastern
countries
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
steeds
of
these
attendants
were
in
appearance
as
foreign
as
their
*NL*
riders
.
They
were
of
Saracen
origin
,
and
consequently
of
Arabian
*NL*
descent
;
and
their
fine
slender
limbs
,
small
fetlocks
,
thin
manes
,
and
*NL*
easy
springy
motion
,
formed
a
marked
contrast
with
the
large-jointed
,
*NL*
heavy
horses
,
of
which
the
race
was
cultivated
in
Flanders
and
in
*NL*
Normandy
,
for
mounting
the
men-at-arms
of
the
period
in
all
the
panoply
*NL*
of
plate
and
mail
;
and
which
,
placed
by
the
side
of
those
Eastern
*NL*
coursers
,
might
have
passed
for
a
personification
of
substance
and
of
*NL*
shadow
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
singular
appearance
of
this
cavalcade
not
only
attracted
the
*NL*
curiosity
of
Wamba
,
but
excited
even
that
of
his
less
volatile
*NL*
companion
.
The
monk
he
instantly
knew
to
be
the
Prior
of
Jorvaulx
*NL*
Abbey
,
well
known
for
many
miles
around
as
a
lover
of
the
chase
,
of
*NL*
the
banquet
,
and
,
if
fame
did
him
not
wrong
,
of
other
worldly
pleasures
*NL*
still
more
inconsistent
with
his
monastic
vows
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
so
loose
were
the
ideas
of
the
times
respecting
the
conduct
of
the
*NL*
clergy
,
whether
secular
or
regular
,
that
the
Prior
Aymer
maintained
a
*NL*
fair
character
in
the
neighbourhood
of
his
abbey
.
His
free
and
jovial
*NL*
temper
,
and
the
readiness
with
which
he
granted
absolution
from
all
*NL*
ordinary
delinquencies
,
rendered
him
a
favourite
among
the
nobility
and
*NL*
principal
gentry
,
to
several
of
whom
he
was
allied
by
birth
,
being
of
*NL*
a
distinguished
Norman
family
.
The
ladies
,
in
particular
,
were
not
*NL*
disposed
to
scan
too
nicely
the
morals
of
a
man
who
was
a
professed
*NL*
admirer
of
their
sex
,
and
who
possessed
many
means
of
dispelling
the
*NL*
ennui
which
was
too
apt
to
intrude
upon
the
halls
and
bowers
of
an
*NL*
ancient
feudal
castle
.
The
Prior
mingled
in
the
sports
of
the
field
with
*NL*
more
than
due
eagerness
,
and
was
allowed
to
possess
the
best-trained
*NL*
hawks
,
and
the
fleetest
greyhounds
in
the
North
Riding
;
circumstances
*NL*
which
strongly
recommended
him
to
the
youthful
gentry
.
With
the
old
,
*NL*
he
had
another
part
to
play
,
which
,
when
needful
,
he
could
sustain
*NL*
with
great
decorum
.
His
knowledge
of
books
,
however
superficial
,
was
*NL*
sufficient
to
impress
upon
their
ignorance
respect
for
his
supposed
*NL*
learning
;
and
the
gravity
of
his
deportment
and
language
,
with
the
high
*NL*
tone
which
he
exerted
in
setting
forth
the
authority
of
the
church
*NL*
and
of
the
priesthood
,
impressed
them
no
less
with
an
opinion
of
his
*NL*
sanctity
.
Even
the
common
people
,
the
severest
critics
of
the
conduct
of
*NL*
their
betters
,
had
commiseration
with
the
follies
of
Prior
Aymer
.
He
*NL*
was
generous
;
and
charity
,
as
it
is
well
known
,
covereth
a
multitude
*NL*
of
sins
,
in
another
sense
than
that
in
which
it
is
said
to
do
so
in
*NL*
Scripture
.
The
revenues
of
the
monastery
,
of
which
a
large
part
was
at
*NL*
his
disposal
,
while
they
gave
him
the
means
of
supplying
his
own
very
*NL*
considerable
expenses
,
afforded
also
those
largesses
which
he
bestowed
*NL*
among
the
peasantry
,
and
with
which
he
frequently
relieved
the
*NL*
distresses
of
the
oppressed
.
If
Prior
Aymer
rode
hard
in
the
chase
,
or
*NL*
remained
long
at
the
banquet
,
--
if
Prior
Aymer
was
seen
,
at
the
early
*NL*
peep
of
dawn
,
to
enter
the
postern
of
the
abbey
,
as
he
glided
home
*NL*
from
some
rendezvous
which
had
occupied
the
hours
of
darkness
,
men
*NL*
only
shrugged
up
their
shoulders
,
and
reconciled
themselves
to
his
*NL*
irregularities
,
by
recollecting
that
the
same
were
practised
by
many
*NL*
of
his
brethren
who
had
no
redeeming
qualities
whatsoever
to
atone
for
*NL*
them
.
Prior
Aymer
,
therefore
,
and
his
character
,
were
well
known
to
*NL*
our
Saxon
serfs
,
who
made
their
rude
obeisance
,
and
received
his
*NL*
``
benedicite
,
mes
filz
,
''
in
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
singular
appearance
of
his
companion
and
his
attendants
,
*NL*
arrested
their
attention
and
excited
their
wonder
,
and
they
could
*NL*
scarcely
attend
to
the
Prior
of
Jorvaulx
'
question
,
when
he
demanded
if
*NL*
they
knew
of
any
place
of
harbourage
in
the
vicinity
;
so
much
were
they
*NL*
surprised
at
the
half
monastic
,
half
military
appearance
of
the
swarthy
*NL*
stranger
,
and
at
the
uncouth
dress
and
arms
of
his
Eastern
attendants
.
*NL*
It
is
probable
,
too
,
that
the
language
in
which
the
benediction
was
*NL*
conferred
,
and
the
information
asked
,
sounded
ungracious
,
though
not
*NL*
probably
unintelligible
,
in
the
ears
of
the
Saxon
peasants
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
asked
you
,
my
children
,
''
said
the
Prior
,
raising
his
voice
,
and
using
*NL*
the
lingua
Franca
,
or
mixed
language
,
in
which
the
Norman
and
Saxon
*NL*
races
conversed
with
each
other
,
``
if
there
be
in
this
neighbourhood
any
*NL*
good
man
,
who
,
for
the
love
of
God
,
and
devotion
to
Mother
Church
,
*NL*
will
give
two
of
her
humblest
servants
,
with
their
train
,
a
night
's
*NL*
hospitality
and
refreshment
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
he
spoke
with
a
tone
of
conscious
importance
,
which
formed
a
strong
*NL*
contrast
to
the
modest
terms
which
he
thought
it
proper
to
employ
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Two
of
the
humblest
servants
of
Mother
Church
!
''
repeated
Wamba
to
*NL*
himself
,
--
but
,
fool
as
he
was
,
taking
care
not
to
make
his
observation
*NL*
audible
;
``
I
should
like
to
see
her
seneschals
,
her
chief
butlers
,
and
*NL*
other
principal
domestics
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
internal
commentary
on
the
Prior
's
speech
,
he
raised
his
*NL*
eyes
,
and
replied
to
the
question
which
had
been
put
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
the
reverend
fathers
,
''
he
said
,
``
loved
good
cheer
and
soft
lodging
,
*NL*
few
miles
of
riding
would
carry
them
to
the
Priory
of
Brinxworth
,
where
*NL*
their
quality
could
not
but
secure
them
the
most
honourable
reception
;
*NL*
or
if
they
preferred
spending
a
penitential
evening
,
they
might
turn
*NL*
down
yonder
wild
glade
,
which
would
bring
them
to
the
hermitage
of
*NL*
Copmanhurst
,
where
a
pious
anchoret
would
make
them
sharers
for
the
*NL*
night
of
the
shelter
of
his
roof
and
the
benefit
of
his
prayers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Prior
shook
his
head
at
both
proposals
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mine
honest
friend
,
''
said
he
,
``
if
the
jangling
of
thy
bells
had
not
*NL*
dizzied
thine
understanding
,
thou
mightst
know
``
Clericus
clericum
non
*NL*
decimat
''
;
that
is
to
say
,
we
churchmen
do
not
exhaust
each
other
's
*NL*
hospitality
,
but
rather
require
that
of
the
laity
,
giving
them
thus
*NL*
an
opportunity
to
serve
God
in
honouring
and
relieving
his
appointed
*NL*
servants
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
true
,
''
replied
Wamba
,
``
that
I
,
being
but
an
ass
,
am
,
*NL*
nevertheless
,
honoured
to
hear
the
bells
as
well
as
your
reverence
's
*NL*
mule
;
notwithstanding
,
I
did
conceive
that
the
charity
of
Mother
Church
*NL*
and
her
servants
might
be
said
,
with
other
charity
,
to
begin
at
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
truce
to
thine
insolence

''
said
the
armed
rider
,
breaking
in
*NL*
on
his
prattle
with
a
high
and
stern
voice
,
``
and
tell

*NL*
*NL*
``

the
Prior
;

*NL*
*NL*
``
The

answered
Gurth
,
who
broke
silence
for
*NL*
the
first
time

``

*NL*
*NL*
``

the
military

will
not
stoop

have
a

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
not

said
Gurth
,
sullenly
,
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
dispute
with
me
,
slave
!
''
said
the
soldier
;
and
,
setting
spurs
*NL*
to
his
horse
,
he
caused
him
make
a
demivolte
across
the
path
,
raising
at
*NL*
the
same
time
the
riding
rod
which
he
held
in
his
hand
,
with
a
purpose
*NL*
of
chastising
what
he
considered
as
the
insolence
of
the
peasant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gurth
darted
at
him
a
savage
and
revengeful
scowl
,
and
with
a
fierce
,
*NL*
yet
hesitating
motion
,
laid
his
hand
on
the
haft
of
his
knife
;
but
the
*NL*
interference
of
Prior
Aymer
,
who
pushed
his
mule
betwixt
his
companion
*NL*
and
the
swineherd
,
prevented
the
meditated
violence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
by
St
Mary
,
brother
Brian
,
you
must
not
think
you
are
now
in
*NL*
Palestine

predominating
over
heathen
Turks

infidel
Saracens

we
*NL*
islanders
love
not

chasteneth

Tell

said
he
to
Wamba
,
and
seconded
his
*NL*
speech
by
a
small
piece
of
silver
coin
,
``
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
In

the
Jester

*NL*
``

said
the
Abbot
,
``
thou
canst
tell

been
all
his

engaged

among
the
Saracens

for
the
recovery
of

;
he
is
of
the
order

*NL*
*NL*
``
If

half
a

said
the
Jester
,
``
he
should
not

unreasonable

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
forgive

the
Abbot
,

wilt
show
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

answered
Wamba
,
``
your

must
hold
on
this

till
you
come
to
a
sunken
cross

of
which
scarce
a
cubit

length
*NL*
remains
above
ground
;
then
take
the
path
to
the
left

for
there
are
*NL*
four
which
meet
at

Cross

I
trust
your

will
obtain
*NL*
shelter
before
the
storm
comes
on

*NL*
*NL*
The
Abbot
thanked
his
sage
adviser
;
and
the
cavalcade
,
setting
spurs
to
*NL*
their
horses
,
rode
on
as
men
do
who
wish
to
reach
their
inn
before
the
*NL*
bursting
of
a
night-storm
.
As
their
horses

hoofs
died
away
,
Gurth
*NL*
said
to
his
companion
,
``
If
they
follow
thy
wise
direction

the
reverend
*NL*
fathers
will
hardly
reach
Rotherwood

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

said
the
Jester

grinning
,
``

they
may
reach
Sheffield

that

I
am
not

*NL*

Gurth

with

But

*NL*
*NL*
We
return
to
the
riders
,
who
had
soon
left
the
bondsmen
far
behind
*NL*
them
,
and
who
maintained
the
following
conversation
in
the
Norman-French
*NL*
language
,
usually
employed
by
the
superior
classes
,
with
the
exception
*NL*
of
the
few
who
were
still
inclined
to
boast
their
Saxon
descent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
mean
these
fellows
by
their
capricious
insolence

''
said
the
*NL*
Templar
to
the
Benedictine
,
``

why
did
you
prevent
me
from
chastising

it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Marry

have
often
told

pleasure
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
soon
have
beat
him
into

observed
Brian
;
``
I
am
*NL*
accustomed
to
deal
with
such
spirits

Our
Turkish
captives

as
fierce

Odin
himself
could
have
been
;
yet
two
months
in
my

household

under
the
management
of
my
master
of
the
slaves

has
made
*NL*
them
humble

submissive

serviceable
,
and
observant
of
your
will
.
Marry

*NL*
sir

you
must
be
aware
of
the
poison

the
dagger
;

they
use
either
*NL*

will
when
you
give
them
the
slightest
opportunity

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay

answered
Prior
Aymer
,
``
every
land
has
its
own
manners

,
besides
that
beating
this

information

been

sure
to
have
established
a

we
found
our

thither

Remember
what
I
told
you
:
this
wealthy
franklin
is
proud

fierce

jealous

irritable

a

of
the
nobility

even
*NL*
of
his
neighbors
,
Reginald
Front-de-Boeuf

Philip
Malvoisin
,
who
are
*NL*
no
babies
to
strive
with
.
He
stands
up
sternly
for
the
privileges
of
*NL*
his
race
,
and
is
so
proud
of
his
uninterrupted
descend
from
Hereward
,
a
*NL*
renowned
champion
of
the
Heptarchy
,
that
he
is
universally
called
Cedric

makes
a
boast
of
his
belonging
to
a
people
from

many

endeaver

hide
their

lest
they

*NL*
``
Prior

I
shall
expect
much
beauty

celebrated
Rowena
to
counterbalance
the
self-denial
and
forbearance
*NL*
which
I
must
exert
if
I
am
to
court
the
favor
of
such
a
seditious

*NL*
*NL*
``
Cedric

the

distantly
connected

I

his

Of

the

*NL*
Yet

take
my
advice

file
your
tongue
to
a
little
more
*NL*
courtesy
than
your
habits
of
predominating
over
infidel
captives
*NL*

Eastern
bondsmen
have
accustomed

.
Cedric
the
Saxon
,
if
*NL*
offended
,
--
and
he
is
noway
slack
in
taking
offence
,
--
is
a
man
who
,
*NL*
without
respect
to
your
knighthood
,
my
high
office
,
or
the
sanctity
*NL*
of
either
,
would
clear
his
house
of
us

and
send
us
to
lodge
with
the
*NL*
larks

the
hour
were
midnight

And
be
careful
how
you
look
on
*NL*
Rowena

he
cherishes
with
the
most
jealous
care

an
he

the
*NL*
least
alarm

It

he
banished

lifting
his
eyes

affection

this
beauty

it
seems
,
at
a

distance
,
but
is
not

the
Blessed
Virgin

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

you
have
said
enough

answered
the
Templar
;
``
I
will
for
a
night
*NL*
put
on
the
needful
restraint

deport

myself

Doubt

not

enough

quarters

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
not
let
it
come
so
far
,
''
answered
the
Prior
;
``
but
here
is
the
*NL*
clown
's
sunken
cross
,
and
the
night
is
so
dark
that
we
can
hardly
see
*NL*
which
of
the
roads
we
are
to
follow
.
He
bid
us
turn
,
I
think
to
the
*NL*
left
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
right

''
said
Brian
,
``
to
the
best
of
my
remembrance

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To

left

certainly

the
left

I
remember
his
pointing
with
his
*NL*
wooden
sword

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
but
he
held
his
sword
in
his
left
hand

and
so
pointed
across
his
*NL*
body
with
it
,
''
said
the
Templar
.
*NL*
*NL*
Each
maintained
his
opinion
with
sufficient
obstinacy
,
as
is
usual
in
*NL*
all
such
cases
;
the
attendants
were
appealed
to
,
but
they
had
not
been
*NL*
near
enough
to
hear
Wamba
's
directions
.
At
length
Brian
remarked
,
what
*NL*
had
at
first
escaped
him
in
the
twilight
;
``
Here
is
some
one
either
*NL*
asleep
,
or
lying
dead
at
the
foot
of
this
cross
--
Hugo
,
stir
him
with
the
*NL*
butt-end
of
thy
lance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
no
sooner
done
than
the
figure
arose
,
exclaiming
in
good
*NL*
French
,
``
Whosoever
thou
art
,
it
is
discourteous
in
you
to
disturb
my
*NL*
thoughts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
did
but
wish
to
ask
you
,
''
said
the
Prior
,
``
the
road
to
Rotherwood
,
*NL*
the
abode
of
Cedric
the
Saxon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
myself
am
bound
thither
,
''
replied
the
stranger
;
``
and
if
I
had
a
*NL*
horse
,
I
would
be
your
guide
,
for
the
way
is
somewhat
intricate
,
though
*NL*
perfectly
well
known
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
shalt
have
both
thanks
and
reward
,
my
friend

''
said
the
Prior
,
``
if
*NL*
thou
wilt
bring
us
to
Cedric
's
in
safety
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
caused
one
of
his
attendants
to
mount
his
own
led
horse
,
and
give
*NL*
that
upon
which
he
had
hitherto
ridden
to
the
stranger
,
who
was
to
serve
*NL*
for
a
guide
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
conductor
pursued
an
opposite
road
from
that
which
Wamba
had
*NL*
recommended
,
for
the
purpose
of
misleading
them
.
The
path
soon
led
*NL*
deeper
into
the
woodland
,
and
crossed
more
than
one
brook
,
the
approach
*NL*
to
which
was
rendered
perilous
by
the
marshes
through
which
it
flowed
;
*NL*
but
the
stranger
seemed
to
know
,
as
if
by
instinct
,
the
soundest
ground
*NL*
and
the
safest
points
of
passage
;
and
by
dint
of
caution
and
attention
,
*NL*
brought
the
party
safely
into
a
wilder
avenue
than
any
they
had
yet
*NL*
seen
;
and
,
pointing
to
a
large
low
irregular
building
at
the
upper
*NL*
extremity
,
he
said
to
the
Prior
,
``
Yonder
is
Rotherwood
,
the
dwelling
of
*NL*
Cedric
the
Saxon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
joyful
intimation
to
Aymer
,
whose
nerves
were
none
of
the
*NL*
strongest
,
and
who
had
suffered
such
agitation
and
alarm
in
the
course
*NL*
of
passing
through
the
dangerous
bogs
,
that
he
had
not
yet
had
the
*NL*
curiosity
to
ask
his
guide
a
single
question
.
Finding
himself
now
at
his
*NL*
ease
and
near
shelter
,
his
curiosity
began
to
awake
,
and
he
demanded
of
*NL*
the
guide
who
and
what
he
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
Palmer
,
just
returned
from
the
Holy
Land
,
''
was
the
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
better
have
tarried
there
to
fight
for
the
recovery
of
the
Holy
*NL*
Sepulchre
,
''
said
the
Templar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
,
Reverend
Sir
Knight
,
''
answered
the
Palmer
,
to
whom
the
appearance
*NL*
of
the
Templar
seemed
perfectly
familiar
;
``
but
when
those
who
are
under
*NL*
oath
to
recover
the
holy
city
,
are
found
travelling
at
such
a
distance
*NL*
from
the
scene
of
their
duties
,
can
you
wonder
that
a
peaceful
peasant
*NL*
like
me
should
decline
the
task
which
they
have
abandoned
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Templar
would
have
made
an
angry
reply
,
but
was
interrupted
by
the
*NL*
Prior
,
who
again
expressed
his
astonishment
,
that
their
guide
,
after
*NL*
such
long
absence
,
should
be
so
perfectly
acquainted
with
the
passes
of
*NL*
the
forest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
born
a
native
of
these
parts
,
''
answered
their
guide
,
and
as
he
*NL*
made
the
reply
they
stood
before
the
mansion
of
Cedric
;
--
a
low
irregular
*NL*
building
,
containing
several
court-yards
or
enclosures
,
extending
over
*NL*
a
considerable
space
of
ground
,
and
which
,
though
its
size
argued
the
*NL*
inhabitant
to
be
a
person
of
wealth
,
differed
entirely
from
the
tall
,
*NL*
turretted
,
and
castellated
buildings
in
which
the
Norman
nobility
*NL*
resided
,
and
which
had
become
the
universal
style
of
architecture
*NL*
throughout
England
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rotherwood
was
not
,
however
,
without
defences
;
no
habitation
,
in
*NL*
that
disturbed
period
,
could
have
been
so
,
without
the
risk
of
being
*NL*
plundered
and
burnt
before
the
next
morning
.
A
deep
fosse
,
or
ditch
,
*NL*
was
drawn
round
the
whole
building
,
and
filled
with
water
from
a
*NL*
neighbouring
stream
.
A
double
stockade
,
or
palisade
,
composed
of
pointed
*NL*
beams
,
which
the
adjacent
forest
supplied
,
defended
the
outer
and
inner
*NL*
bank
of
the
trench
.
There
was
an
entrance
from
the
west
through
the
*NL*
outer
stockade
,
which
communicated
by
a
drawbridge
,
with
a
similar
*NL*
opening
in
the
interior
defences
.
Some
precautions
had
been
taken
to
*NL*
place
those
entrances
under
the
protection
of
projecting
angles
,
by
*NL*
which
they
might
be
flanked
in
case
of
need
by
archers
or
slingers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
this
entrance
the
Templar
wound
his
horn
loudly
;
for
the
rain
,
*NL*
which
had
long
threatened
,
began
now
to
descend
with
great
violence
.

CHAPTER
III
*NL*
*NL*
Then
-LRB-
sad
relief
!
-RRB-
from
the
bleak
coast
that
hears
*NL*
The
German
Ocean
roar
,
deep-blooming
,
strong
,
*NL*
And
yellow
hair
'd
,
the
blue-eyed
Saxon
came
.
*NL*
Thomson
's
Liberty
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
hall
,
the
height
of
which
was
greatly
disproportioned
to
its
*NL*
extreme
length
and
width
,
a
long
oaken
table
,
formed
of
planks
*NL*
rough-hewn
from
the
forest
,
and
which
had
scarcely
received
any
polish
,
*NL*
stood
ready
prepared
for
the
evening
meal
of
Cedric
the
Saxon
.
The
roof
,
*NL*
composed
of
beams
and
rafters
,
had
nothing
to
divide
the
apartment
from
*NL*
the
sky
excepting
the
planking
and
thatch
;
there
was
a
huge
fireplace
at
*NL*
either
end
of
the
hall
,
but
as
the
chimneys
were
constructed
in
a
very
*NL*
clumsy
manner
,
at
least
as
much
of
the
smoke
found
its
way
into
the
*NL*
apartment
as
escaped
by
the
proper
vent
.
The
constant
vapour
which
this
*NL*
occasioned
,
had
polished
the
rafters
and
beams
of
the
low-browed
hall
,
*NL*
by
encrusting
them
with
a
black
varnish
of
soot
.
On
the
sides
of
the
*NL*
apartment
hung
implements
of
war
and
of
the
chase
,
and
there
were
at
*NL*
each
corner
folding
doors
,
which
gave
access
to
other
parts
of
the
*NL*
extensive
building
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
appointments
of
the
mansion
partook
of
the
rude
simplicity
*NL*
of
the
Saxon
period
,
which
Cedric
piqued
himself
upon
maintaining
.
*NL*
The
floor
was
composed
of
earth
mixed
with
lime
,
trodden
into
a
hard
*NL*
substance
,
such
as
is
often
employed
in
flooring
our
modern
barns
.
For
*NL*
about
one
quarter
of
the
length
of
the
apartment
,
the
floor
was
raised
*NL*
by
a
step
,
and
this
space
,
which
was
called
the
dais
,
was
occupied
only
*NL*
by
the
principal
members
of
the
family
,
and
visitors
of
distinction
.
*NL*
For
this
purpose
,
a
table
richly
covered
with
scarlet
cloth
was
placed
*NL*
transversely
across
the
platform
,
from
the
middle
of
which
ran
the
*NL*
longer
and
lower
board
,
at
which
the
domestics
and
inferior
persons
fed
,
*NL*
down
towards
the
bottom
of
the
hall
.
The
whole
resembled
the
form
of
the
*NL*
letter
T
,
or
some
of
those
ancient
dinner-tables
,
which
,
arranged
on
the
*NL*
same
principles
,
may
be
still
seen
in
the
antique
Colleges
of
Oxford
or
*NL*
Cambridge
.
Massive
chairs
and
settles
of
carved
oak
were
placed
upon
the
*NL*
dais
,
and
over
these
seats
and
the
more
elevated
table
was
fastened
a
*NL*
canopy
of
cloth
,
which
served
in
some
degree
to
protect
the
dignitaries
*NL*
who
occupied
that
distinguished
station
from
the
weather
,
and
*NL*
especially
from
the
rain
,
which
in
some
places
found
its
way
through
the
*NL*
ill-constructed
roof
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
walls
of
this
upper
end
of
the
hall
,
as
far
as
the
dais
extended
,
*NL*
were
covered
with
hangings
or
curtains
,
and
upon
the
floor
there
was
a
*NL*
carpet
,
both
of
which
were
adorned
with
some
attempts
at
tapestry
,
or
*NL*
embroidery
,
executed
with
brilliant
or
rather
gaudy
colouring
.
Over
the
*NL*
lower
range
of
table
,
the
roof
,
as
we
have
noticed
,
had
no
covering
;
*NL*
the
rough
plastered
walls
were
left
bare
,
and
the
rude
earthen
floor
was
*NL*
uncarpeted
;
the
board
was
uncovered
by
a
cloth
,
and
rude
massive
benches
*NL*
supplied
the
place
of
chairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
centre
of
the
upper
table
,
were
placed
two
chairs
more
elevated
*NL*
than
the
rest
,
for
the
master
and
mistress
of
the
family
,
who
presided
*NL*
over
the
scene
of
hospitality
,
and
from
doing
so
derived
their
Saxon
*NL*
title
of
honour
,
which
signifies
``
the
Dividers
of
Bread
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
each
of
these
chairs
was
added
a
footstool
,
curiously
carved
and
*NL*
inlaid
with
ivory
,
which
mark
of
distinction
was
peculiar
to
them
.
One
*NL*
of
these
seats
was
at
present
occupied
by
Cedric
the
Saxon
,
who
,
though
*NL*
but
in
rank
a
thane
,
or
,
as
the
Normans
called
him
,
a
Franklin
,
felt
,
at
*NL*
the
delay
of
his
evening
meal
,
an
irritable
impatience
,
which
might
have
*NL*
become
an
alderman
,
whether
of
ancient
or
of
modern
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
appeared
,
indeed
,
from
the
countenance
of
this
proprietor
,
that
he
*NL*
was
of
a
frank
,
but
hasty
and
choleric
temper
.
He
was
not
above
the
*NL*
middle
stature
,
but
broad-shouldered
,
long-armed
,
and
powerfully
made
,
*NL*
like
one
accustomed
to
endure
the
fatigue
of
war
or
of
the
chase
;
his
*NL*
face
was
broad
,
with
large
blue
eyes
,
open
and
frank
features
,
fine
*NL*
teeth
,
and
a
well
formed
head
,
altogether
expressive
of
that
sort
of
*NL*
good-humour
which
often
lodges
with
a
sudden
and
hasty
temper
.
Pride
and
*NL*
jealousy
there
was
in
his
eye
,
for
his
life
had
been
spent
in
asserting
*NL*
rights
which
were
constantly
liable
to
invasion
;
and
the
prompt
,
fiery
,
*NL*
and
resolute
disposition
of
the
man
,
had
been
kept
constantly
upon
the
*NL*
alert
by
the
circumstances
of
his
situation
.
His
long
yellow
hair
was
*NL*
equally
divided
on
the
top
of
his
head
and
upon
his
brow
,
and
combed
*NL*
down
on
each
side
to
the
length
of
his
shoulders
;
it
had
but
little
*NL*
tendency
to
grey
,
although
Cedric
was
approaching
to
his
sixtieth
year
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
dress
was
a
tunic
of
forest
green
,
furred
at
the
throat
and
cuffs
*NL*
with
what
was
called
minever
;
a
kind
of
fur
inferior
in
quality
to
*NL*
ermine
,
and
formed
,
it
is
believed
,
of
the
skin
of
the
grey
squirrel
.
*NL*
This
doublet
hung
unbuttoned
over
a
close
dress
of
scarlet
which
sat
*NL*
tight
to
his
body
;
he
had
breeches
of
the
same
,
but
they
did
not
reach
*NL*
below
the
lower
part
of
the
thigh
,
leaving
the
knee
exposed
.
His
*NL*
feet
had
sandals
of
the
same
fashion
with
the
peasants
,
but
of
finer
*NL*
materials
,
and
secured
in
the
front
with
golden
clasps
.
He
had
bracelets
*NL*
of
gold
upon
his
arms
,
and
a
broad
collar
of
the
same
precious
metal
*NL*
around
his
neck
.
About
his
waist
he
wore
a
richly-studded
belt
,
in
*NL*
which
was
stuck
a
short
straight
two-edged
sword
,
with
a
sharp
point
,
so
*NL*
disposed
as
to
hang
almost
perpendicularly
by
his
side
.
Behind
his
seat
*NL*
was
hung
a
scarlet
cloth
cloak
lined
with
fur
,
and
a
cap
of
the
same
*NL*
materials
richly
embroidered
,
which
completed
the
dress
of
the
opulent
*NL*
landholder
when
he
chose
to
go
forth
.
A
short
boar-spear
,
with
a
broad
*NL*
and
bright
steel
head
,
also
reclined
against
the
back
of
his
chair
,
*NL*
which
served
him
,
when
he
walked
abroad
,
for
the
purposes
of
a
staff
or
*NL*
of
a
weapon
,
as
chance
might
require
.
*NL*
*NL*
Several
domestics
,
whose
dress
held
various
proportions
betwixt
the
*NL*
richness
of
their
master
's
,
and
the
coarse
and
simple
attire
of
Gurth
*NL*
the
swine-herd
,
watched
the
looks
and
waited
the
commands
of
the
Saxon
*NL*
dignitary
.
Two
or
three
servants
of
a
superior
order
stood
behind
their
*NL*
master
upon
the
dais
;
the
rest
occupied
the
lower
part
of
the
hall
.
*NL*
Other
attendants
there
were
of
a
different
description
;
two
or
three
*NL*
large
and
shaggy
greyhounds
,
such
as
were
then
employed
in
hunting
the
*NL*
stag
and
wolf
;
as
many
slow-hounds
of
a
large
bony
breed
,
with
thick
*NL*
necks
,
large
heads
,
and
long
ears
;
and
one
or
two
of
the
smaller
dogs
,
*NL*
now
called
terriers
,
which
waited
with
impatience
the
arrival
of
the
*NL*
supper
;
but
,
with
the
sagacious
knowledge
of
physiognomy
peculiar
to
*NL*
their
race
,
forbore
to
intrude
upon
the
moody
silence
of
their
master
,
*NL*
apprehensive
probably
of
a
small
white
truncheon
which
lay
by
Cedric
's
*NL*
trencher
,
for
the
purpose
of
repelling
the
advances
of
his
four-legged
*NL*
dependants
.
One
grisly
old
wolf-dog
alone
,
with
the
liberty
of
an
*NL*
indulged
favourite
,
had
planted
himself
close
by
the
chair
of
state
,
and
*NL*
occasionally
ventured
to
solicit
notice
by
putting
his
large
hairy
head
*NL*
upon
his
master
's
knee
,
or
pushing
his
nose
into
his
hand
.
Even
he
was
*NL*
repelled
by
the
stern
command
,
``
Down
,
Balder
,
down
!
I
am
not
in
the
*NL*
humour
for
foolery
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
,
Cedric
,
as
we
have
observed
,
was
in
no
very
placid
state
of
*NL*
mind
.
The
Lady
Rowena
,
who
had
been
absent
to
attend
an
evening
mass
at
*NL*
a
distant
church
,
had
but
just
returned
,
and
was
changing
her
garments
,
*NL*
which
had
been
wetted
by
the
storm
.
There
were
as
yet
no
tidings
of
*NL*
Gurth
and
his
charge
,
which
should
long
since
have
been
driven
home
from
*NL*
the
forest
and
such
was
the
insecurity
of
the
period
,
as
to
render
it
*NL*
probable
that
the
delay
might
be
explained
by
some
depreciation
of
the
*NL*
outlaws
,
with
whom
the
adjacent
forest
abounded
,
or
by
the
violence
*NL*
of
some
neighbouring
baron
,
whose
consciousness
of
strength
made
*NL*
him
equally
negligent
of
the
laws
of
property
.
The
matter
was
of
*NL*
consequence
,
for
great
part
of
the
domestic
wealth
of
the
Saxon
*NL*
proprietors
consisted
in
numerous
herds
of
swine
,
especially
in
*NL*
forest-land
,
where
those
animals
easily
found
their
food
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
these
subjects
of
anxiety
,
the
Saxon
thane
was
impatient
for
the
*NL*
presence
of
his
favourite
clown
Wamba
,
whose
jests
,
such
as
they
were
,
*NL*
served
for
a
sort
of
seasoning
to
his
evening
meal
,
and
to
the
deep
*NL*
draughts
of
ale
and
wine
with
which
he
was
in
the
habit
of
accompanying
*NL*
it
.
Add
to
all
this
,
Cedric
had
fasted
since
noon
,
and
his
usual
supper
*NL*
hour
was
long
past
,
a
cause
of
irritation
common
to
country
squires
,
*NL*
both
in
ancient
and
modern
times
.
His
displeasure
was
expressed
in
*NL*
broken
sentences
,
partly
muttered
to
himself
,
partly
addressed
to
the
*NL*
domestics
who
stood
around
;
and
particularly
to
his
cupbearer
,
who
*NL*
offered
him
from
time
to
time
,
as
a
sedative
,
a
silver
goblet
filled
*NL*
with
wine
--
``
Why
tarries
the
Lady
Rowena
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
but
changing
her
head-gear
,
''
replied
a
female
attendant
,
with
as
*NL*
much
confidence
as
the
favourite
lady
's
-
maid
usually
answers
the
master
*NL*
of
a
modern
family
;
``
you
would
not
wish
her
to
sit
down
to
the
banquet
*NL*
in
her
hood
and
kirtle
?
and
no
lady
within
the
shire
can
be
quicker
in
*NL*
arraying
herself
than
my
mistress
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
undeniable
argument
produced
a
sort
of
acquiescent
umph
!
on
the
*NL*
part
of
the
Saxon
,
with
the
addition
,
``
I
wish
her
devotion
may
choose
*NL*
fair
weather
for
the
next
visit
to
St
John
's
Kirk
;
--
but
what
,
in
the
*NL*
name
of
ten
devils
,
''
continued
he
,
turning
to
the
cupbearer
,
and
raising
*NL*
his
voice
as
if
happy
to
have
found
a
channel
into

Oswald
the

modestly
suggested

an

upon

harsh

starting
from

his

in
impatience
at
the
supposed

catching

of
his

boar-spear
;

reflection
seemed
to
conjure
into

his

Replacing

he
resumed
his

bent
his

downward

appeared
to
be
absorbed

From

musing

Cedric
was
suddenly
awakened
by
the
blast
of
a

was
replied
to
by
the
clamorous
yells

barking
of
all

in
the
hall

and
some
twenty

thirty

were
quartered
in
other

It
cost
some
exercise

truncheon

well
seconded
by
the
exertions

to
silence
this
canine

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
the
Saxon

hastily
,
as
soon
as
the
tumult
*NL*
was
so
much
appeased
that
the
dependants
could
hear
his
voice

departed

the

accustomed

*NL*
The
Prior
Aymer
had
taken
the
opportunity
afforded
him
,
of
changing
his
*NL*
riding
robe
for
one
of
yet
more
costly
materials
,
over
which
he
wore
*NL*
a
cope
curiously
embroidered
.
Besides
the
massive
golden
signet
ring
,
*NL*
which
marked
his
ecclesiastical
dignity
,
his
fingers
,
though
contrary
*NL*
to
the
canon
,
were
loaded
with
precious
gems
;
his
sandals
were
of
the
*NL*
finest
leather
which
was
imported
from
Spain
;
his
beard
trimmed
to
as
*NL*
small
dimensions
as
his
order
would
possibly
permit
,
and
his
shaven
*NL*
crown
concealed
by
a
scarlet
cap
richly
embroidered
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
appearance
of
the
Knight
Templar
was
also
changed
;
and
,
though
*NL*
less
studiously
bedecked
with
ornament
,
his
dress
was
as
rich
,
and
*NL*
his
appearance
far
more
commanding
,
than
that
of
his
companion
.
He
had
*NL*
exchanged
his
shirt
of
mail
for
an
under
tunic
of
dark
purple
silk
,
*NL*
garnished
with
furs
,
over
which
flowed
his
long
robe
of
spotless
white
,
*NL*
in
ample
folds
.
The
eight-pointed
cross
of
his
order
was
cut
on
the
*NL*
shoulder
of
his
mantle
in
black
velvet
.
The
high
cap
no
longer
invested
*NL*
his
brows
,
which
were
only
shaded
by
short
and
thick
curled
hair
of
*NL*
a
raven
blackness
,
corresponding
to
his
unusually
swart
complexion
.
*NL*
Nothing
could
be
more
gracefully
majestic
than
his
step
and
manner
,
*NL*
had
they
not
been
marked
by
a
predominant
air
of
haughtiness
,
easily
*NL*
acquired
by
the
exercise
of
unresisted
authority
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
two
dignified
persons
were
followed
by
their
respective
*NL*
attendants
,
and
at
a
more
humble
distance
by
their
guide
,
whose
figure
*NL*
had
nothing
more
remarkable
than
it
derived
from
the
usual
weeds
of
a
*NL*
pilgrim
.
A
cloak
or
mantle
of
coarse
black
serge
,
enveloped
his
whole
*NL*
body
.
It
was
in
shape
something
like
the
cloak
of
a
modern
hussar
,
*NL*
having
similar
flaps
for
covering
the
arms
,
and
was
called
a
``
Sclaveyn
''
,
*NL*
or
``
Sclavonian
''
.
Coarse
sandals
,
bound
with
thongs
,
on
his
bare
feet
;
*NL*
a
broad
and
shadowy
hat
,
with
cockle-shells
stitched
on
its
brim
,
and
*NL*
a
long
staff
shod
with
iron
,
to
the
upper
end
of
which
was
attached
a
*NL*
branch
of
palm
,
completed
the
palmer
's
attire
.
He
followed
modestly
the
*NL*
last
of
the
train
which
entered
the
hall
,
and
,
observing
that
the
lower
*NL*
table
scarce
afforded
room
sufficient
for
the
domestics
of
Cedric
and
*NL*
the
retinue
of
his
guests
,
he
withdrew
to
a
settle
placed
beside
and
*NL*
almost
under
one
of
the
large
chimneys
,
and
seemed
to
employ
himself
in
*NL*
drying
his
garments
,
until
the
retreat
of
some
one
should
make
room
*NL*
at
the
board
,
or
the
hospitality
of
the
steward
should
supply
him
with
*NL*
refreshments
in
the
place
he
had
chosen
apart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cedric
rose
to
receive
his
guests
with
an
air
of
dignified
hospitality
,
*NL*
and
,
descending
from
the
dais
,
or
elevated
part
of
his
hall
,
made
three
*NL*
steps
towards
them
,
and
then
awaited
their
approach
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I

''
he
said
,
``

as
you
,
and
this
valiant
Knight
of
the
Holy
Temple
.
But
my
steward
has
*NL*
expounded
to
you
the
cause
of
my
seeming
discourtesy
.
Let
me
also
pray
,
*NL*
that
you
will
excuse
my
speaking
to
you
in
my
native
language
,
and
that
*NL*
you
will
reply
in
the
same
if
your
knowledge
of
it
permits
;
if
not
,
I
*NL*
sufficiently
understand
Norman
to
follow
your
meaning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Vows
,
''
said
the
Abbot
,
``
must
be
unloosed
,
worthy
Franklin
,
or
permit
*NL*
me
rather
to
say
,
worthy
Thane
,
though
the
title
is
antiquated
.
Vows
*NL*
are
the
knots
which
tie
us
to
Heaven
--
they
are
the
cords
which
bind
*NL*
the
sacrifice
to
the
horns
of
the
altar
,
--
and
are
therefore
,

as
I
said
*NL*
before
,
--
to
be
unloosened

discharged

unless
our
holy
Mother
Church
*NL*
shall
pronounce
the
contrary

And
respecting
language

I
willingly
*NL*
hold
communication
in
that
spoken
by
my
respected
grandmother
,
Hilda
*NL*
of
Middleham
,
who
died
in
odour
of
sanctity
,
little
short
,
if
we
may
*NL*
presume
to

so

glorious

*NL*
*NL*
When
the
Prior
had
ceased
what
he
meant
as
a
conciliatory
harangue
,
*NL*
his
companion
said
briefly
and
emphatically
,
``
I
speak
ever
French
,
*NL*
the
language
of
King
Richard
and
his
nobles
;
but
I
understand
English
*NL*
sufficiently
to
communicate
with
the
natives
of
the
country

''
*NL*
*NL*
Cedric
darted
at
the
speaker
one
of
those
hasty
and
impatient
glances
,
*NL*
which
comparisons
between
the
two
rival
nations
seldom
failed
to
call
*NL*
forth
;
but
,
recollecting
the
duties
of
hospitality
,
he
suppressed
*NL*
further
show
of
resentment
,
and
,
motioning
with
his
hand
,
caused
his
*NL*
guests
to
assume
two
seats
a
little
lower
than
his
own
,
but
placed
close
*NL*
beside
him
,
and
gave
a
signal
that
the
evening
meal
should
be
placed
*NL*
upon
the
board
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
attendants
hastened
to
obey
Cedric
's
commands
,
his
eye
*NL*
distinguished
Gurth
the
swineherd
,
who
,
with
his
companion
Wamba
,
had
*NL*
just
entered
the
hall
.
``
Send
these
loitering
knaves
up
hither
,
''
said
the
*NL*
Saxon
,
impatiently
.
And
when
the
culprits
came
before
the
dais
,
--
``
How
*NL*
comes
it
,
villains
!
that
you
have
loitered
abroad
so
late
as
this
?
Hast
*NL*
thou
brought
home
thy
charge
,
sirrah
Gurth
,
or
hast
thou
left
them
to
*NL*
robbers
and
marauders
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
herd
is
safe
,
so
please
ye
,
''
said
Gurth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
does
not
please
me
,
thou
knave

said
Cedric
,
``
that
I
should
be

otherwise

here
devising
vengeance

my
neighbours
for

not
done
me

I
tell
thee
,
*NL*
shackles

the
prison-house
shall
punish
the
next
offence
of
this
*NL*
kind

''
*NL*
*NL*
Gurth
,
knowing
his
master
's
irritable
temper
,
attempted
no
exculpation
;
*NL*
but
the
Jester
,
who
could
presume
upon
Cedric
's
tolerance
,
by
virtue
*NL*
of
his
privileges
as
a
fool
,
replied
for
them
both
;
``
In
troth
,
uncle
*NL*
Cedric
,
you
are
neither
wise
nor
reasonable
to-night

''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
How
,
sir
?
''
said
his
master
;
``
you
shall
to
the
porter
's
lodge

and
*NL*
taste
of
the
discipline
there
,
if
you
give
your
foolery
such
license
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
First
let
your
wisdom
tell
me
,
''
said
Wamba
,
``
is
it
just
and
reasonable
*NL*

punish
one
person
for
the
fault
of
another
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
not

fool

answered
Cedric
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
should
you
shackle
poor
Gurth
,
uncle

for
the
fault
of
his
dog
*NL*
Fangs
?
for
I
dare
be
sworn
we
lost
not
a
minute
by
the
way
,
when
we
had
*NL*
got
our
herd
together
,
which
Fangs
did
not
manage
until
we
heard
the
*NL*
vesper-bell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
hang
up
Fangs
,
''
said
Cedric
,
turning
hastily
towards
the
*NL*
swineherd
,
``
if
the
fault
is
his
,
and
get
thee
another
dog
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Under
favour
,
uncle
,
''
said
the
Jester
,
``
that
were
still
somewhat
on
the
*NL*
bow-hand
of
fair
justice
;
for
it
was
no
fault
of
Fangs
that
he
was
lame
*NL*
and
could
not
gather
the
herd
,
but
the
fault
of
those
that
struck
off
*NL*
two
of
his
fore-claws
,
an
operation
for
which
,
if
the
poor
fellow
had
*NL*
been
consulted
,
he
would
scarce
have
given
his
voice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
dared
to
lame
an
animal
which
belonged
to
my
bondsman

''
said
*NL*
the
Saxon
,
kindling
in
wrath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marry
,
that
did
old
Hubert

''
said
Wamba
,
``
Sir
Philip
de
Malvoisin
's
*NL*
keeper
of

chase

He
caught
Fangs
strolling
in

and
said
*NL*
he
chased
the
deer
contrary
to
his

*NL*
walk

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
foul

answered
the
Saxon

``

his

will
teach

But
enough

Go

and
thou

get
thee
another

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
feast
,
however
,
which
was
spread
upon
the
board
,
needed
no
apologies
*NL*
from
the
lord
of
the
mansion
.
Swine
's
flesh
,
dressed
in
several
modes
,
*NL*
appeared
on
the
lower
part
of
the
board
,
as
also
that
of
fowls
,
deer
,
*NL*
goats
,
and
hares
,
and
various
kinds
of
fish
,
together
with
huge
loaves
*NL*
and
cakes
of
bread
,
and
sundry
confections
made
of
fruits
and
honey
.
*NL*
The
smaller
sorts
of
wild-fowl
,
of
which
there
was
abundance
,
were
*NL*
not
served
up
in
platters
,
but
brought
in
upon
small
wooden
spits
or
*NL*
broaches
,
and
offered
by
the
pages
and
domestics
who
bore
them
,
to
each
*NL*
guest
in
succession
,
who
cut
from
them
such
a
portion
as
he
pleased
.
*NL*
Beside
each
person
of
rank
was
placed
a
goblet
of
silver
;
the
lower
*NL*
board
was
accommodated
with
large
drinking
horns
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
repast
was
about
to
commence
,
the
major-domo
,
or
steward
,
*NL*
suddenly
raising
his
wand
,
said
aloud
,
--
``
Forbear
!
--
Place
for
the
Lady
*NL*
Rowena
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
side-door
at
the
upper
end
of
the
hall
now
opened
behind
the
banquet
*NL*
table
,
and
Rowena
,
followed
by
four
female
attendants
,
entered
the
*NL*
apartment
.
Cedric
,
though
surprised
,
and
perhaps
not
altogether
*NL*
agreeably
so
,
at
his
ward
appearing
in
public
on
this
occasion
,
hastened
*NL*
to
meet
her
,
and
to
conduct
her
,
with
respectful
ceremony
,
to
the
*NL*
elevated
seat
at
his
own
right
hand
,
appropriated
to
the
lady
of
the
*NL*
mansion
.
All
stood
up
to
receive
her
;
and
,
replying
to
their
courtesy
by
*NL*
a
mute
gesture
of
salutation
,
she
moved
gracefully
forward
to
assume
her
*NL*
place
at
the
board
.
Ere
she
had
time
to
do
so
,
the
Templar
whispered
to
*NL*
the
Prior
,
``
I
shall
wear
no
collar
of
gold
of
yours
at
the
tournament
.
*NL*
The
Chian
wine
is
your
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Said
I
not
so
?
''
answered
the
Prior
;
``
but
check
your
raptures
,
the
*NL*
Franklin
observes
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Unheeding
this
remonstrance
,
and
accustomed
only
to
act
upon
the
*NL*
immediate
impulse
of
his
own
wishes
,
Brian
de
Bois-Guilbert
kept
*NL*
his
eyes
riveted
on
the
Saxon
beauty
,
more
striking
perhaps
to
his
*NL*
imagination
,
because
differing
widely
from
those
of
the
Eastern
*NL*
sultanas
.
*NL*
*NL*
Formed
in
the
best
proportions
of
her
sex
,
Rowena
was
tall
in
stature
,
*NL*
yet
not
so
much
so
as
to
attract
observation
on
account
of
superior
*NL*
height
.
Her
complexion
was
exquisitely
fair
,
but
the
noble
cast
of
her
*NL*
head
and
features
prevented
the
insipidity
which
sometimes
attaches
*NL*
to
fair
beauties
.
Her
clear
blue
eye
,
which
sat
enshrined
beneath
a
*NL*
graceful
eyebrow
of
brown
sufficiently
marked
to
give
expression
to
the
*NL*
forehead
,
seemed
capable
to
kindle
as
well
as
melt
,
to
command
as
well
*NL*
as
to
beseech
.
If
mildness
were
the
more
natural
expression
of
such
a
*NL*
combination
of
features
,
it
was
plain
,
that
in
the
present
instance
,
the
*NL*
exercise
of
habitual
superiority
,
and
the
reception
of
general
homage
,
*NL*
had
given
to
the
Saxon
lady
a
loftier
character
,
which
mingled
with
and
*NL*
qualified
that
bestowed
by
nature
.
Her
profuse
hair
,
of
a
colour
betwixt
*NL*
brown
and
flaxen
,
was
arranged
in
a
fanciful
and
graceful
manner
in
*NL*
numerous
ringlets
,
to
form
which
art
had
probably
aided
nature
.
These
*NL*
locks
were
braided
with
gems
,
and
,
being
worn
at
full
length
,
intimated
*NL*
the
noble
birth
and
free-born
condition
of
the
maiden
.
A
golden
chain
,
*NL*
to
which
was
attached
a
small
reliquary
of
the
same
metal
,
hung
round
*NL*
her
neck
.
She
wore
bracelets
on
her
arms
,
which
were
bare
.
Her
dress
was
*NL*
an
under-gown
and
kirtle
of
pale
sea-green
silk
,
over
which
hung
a
long
*NL*
loose
robe
,
which
reached
to
the
ground
,
having
very
wide
sleeves
,
which
*NL*
came
down
,
however
,
very
little
below
the
elbow
.
This
robe
was
crimson
,
*NL*
and
manufactured
out
of
the
very
finest
wool
.
A
veil
of
silk
,
interwoven
*NL*
with
gold
,
was
attached
to
the
upper
part
of
it
,
which
could
be
,
at
*NL*
the
wearer
's
pleasure
,
either
drawn
over
the
face
and
bosom
after
the
*NL*
Spanish
fashion
,
or
disposed
as
a
sort
of
drapery
round
the
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Rowena
perceived
the
Knight
Templar
's
eyes
bent
on
her
with
an
*NL*
ardour
,
that
,
compared
with
the
dark
caverns
under
which
they
moved
,
*NL*
gave
them
the
effect
of
lighted
charcoal
,
she
drew
with
dignity
the
veil
*NL*
around
her
face
,
as
an
intimation
that
the
determined
freedom
of
his
*NL*
glance
was
disagreeable
.
Cedric
saw
the
motion
and
its
cause
.
``
Sir
*NL*
Templar
,
''
said
he
,
``
the
cheeks
of
our
Saxon
maidens
have
seen
too
little
*NL*
of
the
sun
to
enable
them
to
bear
the
fixed
glance
of
a
crusader
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
have
offended
,
''
replied
Sir
Brian
,
``
I
crave
your
pardon
,
--
that
*NL*
is
,
I
crave
the
Lady
Rowena
's
pardon
,
--
for
my
humility
will
carry
me
no
*NL*
lower
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Lady
Rowena
,
''
said
the
Prior
,
``
has
punished
us
all
,
in
chastising
*NL*
the
boldness
of
my
friend

Let
me
hope
she
will
be
less
cruel
to
the
*NL*
splendid
train
which
are
to
meet
at
the
tournament
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
going
thither
,
''
said
Cedric
,
``
is
uncertain

I
love
not
these
*NL*
vanities

were
unknown
to
my
fathers
when
England
was
free
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
hope
,
nevertheless
,
''
said
the
Prior
,
``
our
company
may
determine
*NL*
you
to
travel
thitherward
;
when
the
roads
are
so
unsafe
,
the
escort
of
*NL*
Sir
Brian
de
Bois-Guilbert
is
not
to
be
despised
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
Prior
,
''
answered
the
Saxon
,
``
wheresoever
I
have
travelled
in
this
*NL*
land
,
I
have
hitherto
found
myself
,
with
the
assistance
of
my
good
sword
*NL*
and
faithful
followers
,
in
no
respect
needful
of
other
aid
.
At
present
,
*NL*
if
we
indeed
journey
to
Ashby-de-la-Zouche
,
we
do
so
with
my
noble
*NL*
neighbour
and
countryman
Athelstane
of
Coningsburgh
,
and
with
such
a
*NL*
train
as
would
set
outlaws
and
feudal
enemies
at
defiance
.

I
drink
*NL*
to
you
,
Sir
Prior
,
in
this
cup
of
wine
,
which
I
trust
your
taste
will
*NL*
approve

I
thank
you
for
your
courtesy

Should
you
be
so
rigid
*NL*
in
adhering
to
monastic
rule

he
added
,
``
as
to
prefer
your
acid
*NL*
preparation
of
milk
,
I
hope
you
will
not
strain
courtesy
to
do
me

reason
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay

''
said
the
Priest
,
laughing
,
``
it
is
only
in
our
abbey
that
we
*NL*
confine
ourselves
to

either

*NL*
Conversing

we
use

fashions

therefore
*NL*
I
answer
your

honest
wine

leave
the
weaker
liquor
to
*NL*
my
lay-brother

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I

said
the
Templar
,
filling
his
goblet
,
``

never
been

half

said
Rowena
with
dignity
,
and
*NL*
without
unveiling
herself
;
``

rather
I
will
tax
it
so
far
as
to
require

of
you
the

theme
more
agreeable

*NL*
``
I

Bois-Guilbert
,
``

*NL*
*NL*
He
was
interrupted
by
Wamba
,
who
had
taken
his
appropriated
seat
upon
*NL*
a
chair
,
the
back
of
which
was
decorated
with
two
ass
's
ears
,
and
which
*NL*
was
placed
about
two
steps
behind
that
of
his
master
,
who
,
from
time
*NL*
to
time
,
supplied
him
with
victuals
from
his
own
trencher
;
a
favour
,
*NL*
however
,
which
the
Jester
shared
with
the
favourite
dogs
,
of
whom
,
as
we
*NL*
have
already
noticed
,
there
were
several
in
attendance
.
Here
sat
Wamba
,
*NL*
with
a
small
table
before
him
,
his
heels
tucked
up
against
the
bar
of
*NL*
the
chair
,
his
cheeks
sucked
up
so
as
to
make
his
jaws
resemble
a
pair
*NL*
of
nut-crackers
,
and
his
eyes
half-shut
,
yet
watching
with
alertness
*NL*
every
opportunity
to
exercise
his
licensed
foolery
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
truces
with
the
infidels
,
''
he
exclaimed
,
without
caring
how
*NL*
suddenly
he
interrupted
the
stately
Templar
,
``
make
an
old
man
of
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
to

Cedric
,
his
features
prepared
to
receive
*NL*
favourably
the
expected
jest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because

''
answered
Wamba
,
``
I
remember
three
of
them
in
my
day

each
*NL*
of
which
was
to
endure

so
that

by

I
must
be
at

a
hundred

fifty

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
warrant
you
against
dying
of

said
the
*NL*
Templar
,
who
now
recognised
his
friend
of
the
forest
;
``
I
will
assure
*NL*
you
from
all
deaths

a
violent
one

did
this
night
to
the
Prior

*NL*
*NL*
``
How

Cedric
,
``

We
must
have
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

the
Jester
,
``

my

I
did

make
a

my

*NL*
*NL*
Conversation
was
here
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
the
porter
's
*NL*
page
,
who
announced
that
there
was
a
stranger
at
the
gate
,
imploring
*NL*
admittance
and
hospitality
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Admit
him

Cedric
,
``

Oswald
,
returning
,
whispered
into
the
ear
of
his
master
,
``
It

*NL*
``
Let

the

crossing
himself

``

*NL*
*NL*
``
A

the

*NL*
*NL*
``
By

said
Wamba
,
``
it
would
seem

than

*NL*
*NL*
``
Peace

my
worthy

said
Cedric
;
``
my
hospitality

not

years
than
a
layman
can
number

we
may
*NL*
endure
the
presence

Jew
for
a
few
hours

But
I
constrain
no
man

converse

with
him

Let

he
said
smiling
,

admit

*NL*
``
Sir
Franklin

answered
the
Templar
,
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Now

said
Wamba
,
``
I
can
not

*NL*
*NL*
``
He

Cedric
;

*NL*
*NL*
``
The

answered
Wamba
,
raising
the
relics
of
a
gammon
of
bacon
,
*NL*
``
will
take
care
to
erect
a
bulwark

*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush

''
said
Cedric
,
``
for
here
he
comes

''
*NL*
*NL*
Introduced
with
little
ceremony
,
and
advancing
with
fear
and
hesitation
,
*NL*
and
many
a
bow
of
deep
humility
,
a
tall
thin
old
man
,
who
,
however
,
had
*NL*
lost
by
the
habit
of
stooping
much
of
his
actual
height
,
approached
the
*NL*
lower
end
of
the
board
.
His
features
,
keen
and
regular
,
with
an
aquiline
*NL*
nose
,
and
piercing
black
eyes
;
his
high
and
wrinkled
forehead
,
and
long
*NL*
grey
hair
and
beard
,
would
have
been
considered
as
handsome
,
had
they
*NL*
not
been
the
marks
of
a
physiognomy
peculiar
to
a
race
,
which
,
during
*NL*
those
dark
ages
,
was
alike
detested
by
the
credulous
and
prejudiced
*NL*
vulgar
,
and
persecuted
by
the
greedy
and
rapacious
nobility
,
and
who
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
owing
to
that
very
hatred
and
persecution
,
had
adopted
a
*NL*
national
character
,
in
which
there
was
much
,
to
say
the
least
,
mean
and
*NL*
unamiable
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Jew
's
dress
,
which
appeared
to
have
suffered
considerably
from
the
*NL*
storm
,
was
a
plain
russet
cloak
of
many
folds
,
covering
a
dark
purple
*NL*
tunic
.
He
had
large
boots
lined
with
fur
,
and
a
belt
around
his
*NL*
waist
,
which
sustained
a
small
knife
,
together
with
a
case
for
writing
*NL*
materials
,
but
no
weapon
.
He
wore
a
high
square
yellow
cap
of
a
peculiar
*NL*
fashion
,
assigned
to
his
nation
to
distinguish
them
from
Christians
,
and
*NL*
which
he
doffed
with
great
humility
at
the
door
of
the
hall
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reception
of
this
person
in
the
hall
of
Cedric
the
Saxon
,
was
such
*NL*
as
might
have
satisfied
the
most
prejudiced
enemy
of
the
tribes
of
*NL*
Israel
.
Cedric
himself
coldly
nodded
in
answer
to
the
Jew
's
repeated
*NL*
salutations
,
and
signed
to
him
to
take
place
at
the
lower
end
of
the
*NL*
table
,
where
,
however
,
no
one
offered
to
make
room
for
him
.
On
the
*NL*
contrary
,
as
he
passed
along
the
file
,
casting
a
timid
supplicating
*NL*
glance
,
and
turning
towards
each
of
those
who
occupied
the
lower
end
of
*NL*
the
board
,
the
Saxon
domestics
squared
their
shoulders
,
and
continued
*NL*
to
devour
their
supper
with
great
perseverance
,
paying
not
the
least
*NL*
attention
to
the
wants
of
the
new
guest
.
The
attendants
of
the
Abbot
*NL*
crossed
themselves
,
with
looks
of
pious
horror
,
and
the
very
heathen
*NL*
Saracens
,
as
Isaac
drew
near
them
,
curled
up
their
whiskers
with
*NL*
indignation
,
and
laid
their
hands
on
their
poniards
,
as
if
ready
to
*NL*
rid
themselves
by
the
most
desperate
means
from
the
apprehended
*NL*
contamination
of
his
nearer
approach
.
*NL*
*NL*
Probably
the
same
motives
which
induced
Cedric
to
open
his
hall
to
this
*NL*
son
of
a
rejected
people
,
would
have
made
him
insist
on
his
attendants
*NL*
receiving
Isaac
with
more
courtesy
.
But
the
Abbot
had
,
at
this
moment
,
*NL*
engaged
him
in
a
most
interesting
discussion
on
the
breed
and
character
*NL*
of
his
favourite
hounds
,
which
he
would
not
have
interrupted
for
matters
*NL*
of
much
greater
importance
than
that
of
a
Jew
going
to
bed
supperless
.
*NL*
While
Isaac
thus
stood
an
outcast
in
the
present
society
,
like
his
*NL*
people
among
the
nations
,
looking
in
vain
for
welcome
or
resting
*NL*
place
,
the
pilgrim
who
sat
by
the
chimney
took
compassion
upon
him
,
and
*NL*
resigned
his
seat
,
saying
briefly
,
``
Old
man
,
my
garments
are
dried
,
*NL*
my
hunger
is
appeased
,
thou
art
both
wet
and
fasting
.
''
So
saying
,
he
*NL*
gathered
together
,
and
brought
to
a
flame
,
the
decaying
brands
which
*NL*
lay
scattered
on
the
ample
hearth
;
took
from
the
larger
board
a
mess
of
*NL*
pottage
and
seethed
kid
,
placed
it
upon
the
small
table
at
which
he
had
*NL*
himself
supped
,
and
,
without
waiting
the
Jew
's
thanks
,
went
to
the
*NL*
other
side
of
the
hall
;
--
whether
from
unwillingness
to
hold
more
close
*NL*
communication
with
the
object
of
his
benevolence
,
or
from
a
wish
to
draw
*NL*
near
to
the
upper
end
of
the
table
,
seemed
uncertain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
there
been
painters
in
those
days
capable
to
execute
such
a
subject
,
*NL*
the
Jew
,
as
he
bent
his
withered
form
,
and
expanded
his
chilled
and
*NL*
trembling
hands
over
the
fire
,
would
have
formed
no
bad
emblematical
*NL*
personification
of
the
Winter
season
.
Having
dispelled
the
cold
,
he
*NL*
turned
eagerly
to
the
smoking
mess
which
was
placed
before
him
,
and
*NL*
ate
with
a
haste
and
an
apparent
relish
,
that
seemed
to
betoken
long
*NL*
abstinence
from
food
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
the
Abbot
and
Cedric
continued
their
discourse
upon
hunting
;
*NL*
the
Lady
Rowena
seemed
engaged
in
conversation
with
one
of
her
attendant
*NL*
females
;
and
the
haughty
Templar
,
whose
eye
wandered
from
the
Jew
to
*NL*
the
Saxon
beauty
,
revolved
in
his
mind
thoughts
which
appeared
deeply
to
*NL*
interest
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
marvel
,
worthy
Cedric
,
''
said
the
Abbot
,
as
their
discourse
proceeded
,
*NL*
``
that
,
great
as
your
predilection
is
for
your
own
manly
language
,
you
do
*NL*
not
receive
the
Norman-French
into
your
favour
,
so
far
at
least
as
the
*NL*
mystery
of
wood-craft
and
hunting
is
concerned
.
Surely
no
tongue
is
so
*NL*
rich
in
the
various
phrases
which
the
field-sports
demand
,
or
furnishes
*NL*
means
to
the
experienced
woodman
so
well
to
express
his
jovial
art
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good

said
the
Saxon
,
``

it
known

not

over-sea
refinements

without
which
I

well
enough
take
my
*NL*
pleasure

*NL*
*NL*
``
The

said
the
Templar
,
raising
his
voice
with
the
presumptuous
*NL*
and
authoritative
tone
which
he
used
upon
all
occasions
,
``
is
not
only
*NL*
the
natural
language
of
the
chase

that
of
love

*NL*
*NL*
``
Pledge

Cedric

another
to

As
Cedric
the
Saxon
then
was

his
plain
English
tale
*NL*
needed
no
garnish
from
French
troubadours
,
when
it
was
told
in
the
ear
*NL*
of
beauty
;
and
the
field
of
Northallerton
,
upon
the
day
of
the
Holy

Standard
,
could
tell
whether
the
Saxon
war-cry
was
not
heard
as
far
*NL*
within
the

Scottish
host
as
the
`

He
drank
deep

and
went
on
with

increasing
warmth

*NL*

unceasing
bulwark

*NL*
*NL*
``
Second

''
said
the
Pilgrim

who
had
stood
near
enough
to
hear

had
listened
to
this
conversation
with
marked
impatience

All
turned

toward

whence
this
unexpected
asseveration
was
heard

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,

repeated
the
Pilgrim
in
a
firm

strong
voice

that
the

I

cast
to
the

add

that

assailants
were

It
is
impossible
for
language
to
describe
the
bitter
scowl

rage

rendered

darker
the
swarthy
countenance

In
the

extremity

his
resentment

his
quivering
fingers
griped
*NL*
towards
the
handle

perhaps
only
withdrew

``

the

taking
a
small
ivory
box
from

crossing
himself

The

crossed

repeated

in
*NL*
which
all
devoutly
joined
,
excepting
the
Jew

the
Mahomedans

and
the
*NL*
Templar

the

of
whom
,
without
vailing
his
bonnet
,
or
testifying
*NL*
any
reverence
for
the
alleged
sanctity
of
the
relic
,
took
from
his
neck
*NL*
a
gold
chain

he
flung
on
the
board

saying

*NL*
*NL*
A
crowd
of
conflicting
emotions
seemed
to
have
occupied
Cedric
,
and
*NL*
kept
him
silent
during
this
discussion
.
Gratified
pride
,
resentment
,
*NL*
embarrassment
,
chased
each
other
over
his
broad
and
open
brow
,
like
the
*NL*
shadow
of
clouds
drifting
over
a
harvest-field
;
while
his
attendants
,
*NL*
on
whom
the
name
of
the
sixth
knight
seemed
to
produce
an
effect
almost
*NL*
electrical
,
hung
in
suspense
upon
their
master
's
looks
.
But
when
Rowena
*NL*
spoke
,
the
sound
of
her
voice
seemed
to
startle
him
from
his
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lady
,
''
said
Cedric
,
``
this
beseems
not
;
were
further
pledge
necessary
,
I
*NL*
myself

offended

and
justly
offended

as
I
am
,
would
yet
gage
my
honour
*NL*
for
the
honour
of
Ivanhoe
.
But
the
wager
of
battle
is
complete
,
even
*NL*
according
to
the
fantastic
fashions
of
Norman
chivalry
--
Is
it
not
,
*NL*
Father
Aymer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
,
''
replied
the
Prior
;
``
and
the
blessed
relic
and
rich
chain
will
I
*NL*
bestow
safely
in
the
treasury
of
our
convent
,
until
the
decision
of
this
*NL*
warlike
challenge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Having
thus
spoken
,
he
crossed
himself
again
and
again
,
and
after
*NL*
many
genuflections
and
muttered
prayers
,
he
delivered
the
reliquary
to
*NL*
Brother
Ambrose
,
his
attendant
monk
,
while
he
himself
swept
up
with
less
*NL*
ceremony
,
but
perhaps
with
no
less
internal
satisfaction
,
the
golden
*NL*
chain
,
and
bestowed
it
in
a
pouch
lined
with
perfumed
leather
,
which
*NL*
opened
under
his
arm
.
``
And
now
,
Sir
Cedric
,
''
he
said
,
``
my
ears
are
*NL*
chiming
vespers
with
the
strength
of
your
good
wine

permit
us
another
*NL*
pledge
to
the
welfare
of
the
Lady
Rowena
,

indulge
us
with
liberty
to
*NL*
pass
to
our
repose

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
rood
of
Bromholme
,

said
the
Saxon
,
``
you
do
but
small
credit
to
*NL*
your
fame

Sir
Prior
!
Report
speaks
you
a
bonny
monk

that
would
hear
*NL*
the
matin
chime
ere
he
quitted
his
bowl
;
and
,
old
as
I
am
,
I
feared
to
*NL*
have
shame
in
encountering
you
.
But
,
by
my
faith
,
a
Saxon
boy
of
twelve
,
*NL*
in
my
time
,
would
not
so
soon
have
relinquished
his
goblet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Prior
had
his
own
reasons
,
however
,
for
persevering
in
the
course
*NL*
of
temperance
which
he
had
adopted
.
He
was
not
only
a
professional
*NL*
peacemaker
,
but
from
practice
a
hater
of
all
feuds
and
brawls
.
It
was
*NL*
not
altogether
from
a
love
to
his
neighbour
,
or
to
himself
,
or
from
*NL*
a
mixture
of
both
.
On
the
present
occasion
,
he
had
an
instinctive
*NL*
apprehension
of
the
fiery
temper
of
the
Saxon
,
and
saw
the
danger
that
*NL*
the
reckless
and
presumptuous
spirit
,
of
which
his
companion
had
*NL*
already
given
so
many
proofs
,
might
at
length
produce
some
disagreeable
*NL*
explosion
.
He
therefore
gently
insinuated
the
incapacity
of
the
native
*NL*
of
any
other
country
to
engage
in
the
genial
conflict
of
the
bowl
*NL*
with
the
hardy
and
strong-headed
Saxons
;
something
he
mentioned
,
but
*NL*
slightly
,
about
his
own
holy
character
,
and
ended
by
pressing
his
*NL*
proposal
to
depart
to
repose
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
grace-cup
was
accordingly
served
round
,
and
the
guests
,
after
making
*NL*
deep
obeisance
to
their
landlord
and
to
the
Lady
Rowena
,
arose
and
*NL*
mingled
in
the
hall
,
while
the
heads
of
the
family
,
by
separate
doors
,
*NL*
retired
with
their
attendants
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Unbelieving
dog
,
''
said
the
Templar
to
Isaac
the
Jew
,
as
he
passed
him
*NL*
in
the
throng
,
``
dost
thou
bend
thy
course
to
the
tournament
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
so
propose

replied
Isaac
,
bowing
in
all
humility
,
``
if
it
please
*NL*
your
reverend
valour

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay

said
the
Knight
,
``

the

the
Jew

clasping
his
hands
;

The
Templar
smiled
sourly
as
he
replied
,
``
Beshrew
thee
for
a
*NL*
false-hearted
liar
!
''
and
passing
onward
,
as
if
disdaining
farther
*NL*
conference
,
he
communed
with
his
Moslem
slaves
in
a
language
unknown
to
*NL*
the
bystanders
.
The
poor
Israelite
seemed
so
staggered
by
the
address
*NL*
of
the
military
monk
,
that
the
Templar
had
passed
on
to
the
extremity

of
the
hall
ere
he
raised
his
head
from
the
humble
posture
which
he
had
*NL*
assumed
,
so
far
as
to
be
sensible
of
his
departure
.
And
when
he
did
*NL*
look
around
,
it
was
with
the
astonished
air
of
one
at
whose
feet
a
*NL*
thunderbolt
has
just
burst
,
and
who
hears
still
the
astounding
report
*NL*
ringing
in
his
ears
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Templar
and
Prior
were
shortly
after
marshalled
to
their
sleeping
*NL*
apartments
by
the
steward
and
the
cupbearer
,
each
attended
by
two
*NL*
torchbearers
and
two
servants
carrying
refreshments
,
while
servants
of
*NL*
inferior
condition
indicated
to
their
retinue
and
to
the
other
guests
*NL*
their
respective
places
of
repose

CHAPTER
VI
*NL*
*NL*
To
buy
his
favour
I
extend
this
friendship
:
*NL*
If
he
will
take
it
,
so
;
if
not
,
adieu
;
*NL*
And
,
for
my
love
,
I
pray
you
wrong
me
not
.
*NL*
--
Merchant
of
Venice
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
Palmer
,
lighted
by
a
domestic
with
a
torch
,
passed
through
the
*NL*
intricate
combination
of
apartments
of
this
large
and
irregular
mansion
,
*NL*
the
cupbearer
coming
behind
him
whispered
in
his
ear
,
that
if
he
had
*NL*
no
objection
to
a
cup
of
good
mead
in
his
apartment
,
there
were
many
*NL*
domestics
in
that
family
who
would
gladly
hear
the
news
he
had
brought
*NL*
from
the
Holy
Land
,
and
particularly
that
which
concerned
the
Knight
of
*NL*
Ivanhoe
.
Wamba
presently
appeared
to
urge
the
same
request
,
observing
*NL*
that
a
cup
after
midnight
was
worth
three
after
curfew
.
Without
*NL*
disputing
a
maxim
urged
by
such
grave
authority
,
the
Palmer
thanked
them
*NL*
for
their
courtesy
,
but
observed
that
he
had
included
in
his
religious
*NL*
vow
,
an
obligation
never
to
speak
in
the
kitchen
on
matters
which
were
*NL*
prohibited
in
the
hall
.
``
That
vow
,
''
said
Wamba
to
the
cupbearer
,
``
would
*NL*
scarce
suit
a
serving-man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
cupbearer
shrugged
up
his
shoulders
in
displeasure
.
``
I
thought
to
*NL*
have
lodged
him
in
the
solere
chamber
,
''
said
he
;
``
but
since
he
is
so
*NL*
unsocial
to
Christians
,
e
`
en
let
him
take
the
next
stall
to
Isaac
the
*NL*
Jew
's
.
--
Anwold
,
''
said
he
to
the
torchbearer
,
``
carry
the
Pilgrim
to
the
*NL*
southern
cell
.
--
I
give
you
good-night
,
''
he
added
,
``
Sir
Palmer
,
with
*NL*
small
thanks
for
short
courtesy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-night
,
and
Our
Lady
's
benison
,
''
said
the
Palmer
,
with
composure
;
*NL*
and
his
guide
moved
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
small
antechamber
,
into
which
several
doors
opened
,
and
which
was
*NL*
lighted
by
a
small
iron
lamp
,
they
met
a
second
interruption
from
the
*NL*
waiting-maid
of
Rowena
,
who
,
saying
in
a
tone
of
authority
,
that
her
*NL*
mistress
desired
to
speak
with
the
Palmer
,
took
the
torch
from
the
hand
*NL*
of
Anwold
,
and
,
bidding
him
await
her
return
,
made
a
sign
to
the
*NL*
Palmer
to
follow
.
Apparently
he
did
not
think
it
proper
to
decline
this
*NL*
invitation
as
he
had
done
the
former
;
for
,
though
his
gesture
*NL*
indicated
some
surprise
at
the
summons
,
he
obeyed
it
without
answer
or
*NL*
remonstrance
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
short
passage
,
and
an
ascent
of
seven
steps
,
each
of
which
was
*NL*
composed
of
a
solid
beam
of
oak
,
led
him
to
the
apartment
of
the
Lady
*NL*
Rowena
,
the
rude
magnificence
of
which
corresponded
to
the
respect
which
*NL*
was
paid
to
her
by
the
lord
of
the
mansion
.
The
walls
were
covered
with
*NL*
embroidered
hangings
,
on
which
different-coloured
silks
,
interwoven
with
*NL*
gold
and
silver
threads
,
had
been
employed
with
all
the
art
of
which
the
*NL*
age
was
capable
,
to
represent
the
sports
of
hunting
and
hawking
.
The
bed
*NL*
was
adorned
with
the
same
rich
tapestry
,
and
surrounded
with
curtains
*NL*
dyed
with
purple
.
The
seats
had
also
their
stained
coverings
,
and
one
,
*NL*
which
was
higher
than
the
rest
,
was
accommodated
with
a
footstool
of
*NL*
ivory
,
curiously
carved
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
fewer
than
four
silver
candelabras
,
holding
great
waxen
torches
,
*NL*
served
to
illuminate
this
apartment
.
Yet
let
not
modern
beauty
envy
the
*NL*
magnificence
of
a
Saxon
princess
.
The
walls
of
the
apartment
were
so
ill
*NL*
finished
and
so
full
of
crevices
,
that
the
rich
hangings
shook
in
the
*NL*
night
blast
,
and
,
in
despite
of
a
sort
of
screen
intended
to
protect
*NL*
them
from
the
wind
,
the
flame
of
the
torches
streamed
sideways
into
the
*NL*
air
,
like
the
unfurled
pennon
of
a
chieftain
.
Magnificence
there
was
,
*NL*
with
some
rude
attempt
at
taste
;
but
of
comfort
there
was
little
,
and
,
*NL*
being
unknown
,
it
was
unmissed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Lady
Rowena
,
with
three
of
her
attendants
standing
at
her
back
,
and
*NL*
arranging
her
hair
ere
she
lay
down
to
rest
,
was
seated
in
the
sort
of
*NL*
throne
already
mentioned
,
and
looked
as
if
born
to
exact
general
homage
.
*NL*
The
Pilgrim
acknowledged
her
claim
to
it
by
a
low
genuflection
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rise
,
Palmer
,
''
said
she
graciously
.
``
The
defender
of
the
absent
has
*NL*
a
right
to
favourable
reception
from
all
who
value
truth
,
and
honour
*NL*
manhood
.
''
She
then
said
to
her
train
,
``
Retire
,
excepting
only
Elgitha
;
I
*NL*
would
speak
with
this
holy
Pilgrim
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
maidens
,
without
leaving
the
apartment
,
retired
to
its
further
*NL*
extremity
,
and
sat
down
on
a
small
bench
against
the
wall
,
where
they
*NL*
remained
mute
as
statues
,
though
at
such
a
distance
that
their
whispers
*NL*
could
not
have
interrupted
the
conversation
of
their
mistress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pilgrim
,
''
said
the
lady
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
,
during
which
she
*NL*
seemed
uncertain
how
to
address
him
,
``
you
this
night
mentioned
a
name
--
I
*NL*
mean
,
''
she
said
,
with
a
degree
of
effort
,
``
the
name
of
Ivanhoe
,
in
*NL*
the
halls
where
by
nature
and
kindred
it
should
have
sounded
most
*NL*
acceptably
;
and
yet
,
such
is
the
perverse
course
of
fate
,
that
of
many
*NL*
whose
hearts
must
have
throbbed
at
the
sound
,
I
,
only
,
dare
ask
you
*NL*
where
,
and
in
what
condition
,
you
left
him
of
whom
you
spoke
?
--
We
heard
,
*NL*
that
,
having
remained
in
Palestine
,
on
account
of
his
impaired
health
,
*NL*
after
the
departure
of
the
English
army
,
he
had
experienced
the
*NL*
persecution
of
the
French
faction
,
to
whom
the
Templars
are
known
to
be
*NL*
attached
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
little
of
the
Knight
of
Ivanhoe
,
''
answered
the
Palmer
,
with
*NL*
a
troubled
voice
.
``
I
would
I
knew
him
better
,
since
you
,
lady
,
are
*NL*
interested
in
his
fate
.
He
hath
,
I
believe
,
surmounted
the
persecution
*NL*
of
his
enemies
in
Palestine
,
and
is
on
the
eve
of
returning
to
England
,
*NL*
where
you
,
lady
,
must
know
better
than
I
,
what
is
his
chance
of
*NL*
happiness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Lady
Rowena
sighed
deeply
,
and
asked
more
particularly
when
the
*NL*
Knight
of
Ivanhoe
might
be
expected
in
his
native
country
,
and
whether
*NL*
he
would
not
be
exposed
to
great
dangers
by
the
road
.
On
the
first
*NL*
point
,
the
Palmer
professed
ignorance
;
on
the
second
,
he
said
that
the
*NL*
voyage
might
be
safely
made
by
the
way
of
Venice
and
Genoa
,
and
from
*NL*
thence
through
France
to
England
.
``
Ivanhoe
,
''
he
said
,
``
was
so
well
*NL*
acquainted
with
the
language
and
manners
of
the
French
,
that
there
was
*NL*
no
fear
of
his
incurring
any
hazard
during
that
part
of
his
travels
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
to
God
,
''
said
the
Lady
Rowena
,
``
he
were
here
safely
arrived
,
and
*NL*
able
to
bear
arms
in
the
approaching
tourney
,
in
which
the
chivalry
*NL*
of
this
land
are
expected
to
display
their
address
and
valour
.
Should
*NL*
Athelstane
of
Coningsburgh
obtain
the
prize
,
Ivanhoe
is
like
to
hear
*NL*
evil
tidings
when
he
reaches
England
.
--
How
looked
he
,
stranger
,
when
*NL*
you
last
saw
him
?
Had
disease
laid
her
hand
heavy
upon
his
strength
and
*NL*
comeliness
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
darker
,
''
said
the
Palmer
,
``
and
thinner
,
than
when
he
came
from
*NL*
Cyprus
in
the
train
of
Coeur-de-Lion
,
and
care
seemed
to
sit
heavy
on
*NL*
his
brow
;
but
I
approached
not
his
presence
,
because
he
is
unknown
to
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
will
,
''
said
the
lady
,
``
I
fear
,
find
little
in
his
native
land
to
*NL*
clear
those
clouds
from
his
countenance
.
Thanks
,
good
Pilgrim
,
for
your
*NL*
information
concerning
the
companion
of
my
childhood
.
--
Maidens
,
''
she
*NL*
said
,
``
draw
near
--
offer
the
sleeping
cup
to
this
holy
man
,
whom
I
will
*NL*
no
longer
detain
from
repose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
maidens
presented
a
silver
cup
,
containing
a
rich
mixture
of
*NL*
wine
and
spice
,
which
Rowena
barely
put
to
her
lips
.
It
was
then
offered
*NL*
to
the
Palmer
,
who
,
after
a
low
obeisance
,
tasted
a
few
drops
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Accept
this
alms
,
friend
,
''
continued
the
lady
,
offering
a
piece
of
*NL*
gold
,
``
in
acknowledgment
of
thy
painful
travail
,
and
of
the
shrines
thou
*NL*
hast
visited
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Palmer
received
the
boon
with
another
low
reverence
,
and
followed
*NL*
Edwina
out
of
the
apartment
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
anteroom
he
found
his
attendant
Anwold
,
who
,
taking
the
torch
*NL*
from
the
hand
of
the
waiting-maid
,
conducted
him
with
more
haste
than
*NL*
ceremony
to
an
exterior
and
ignoble
part
of
the
building
,
where
a
number
*NL*
of
small
apartments
,
or
rather
cells
,
served
for
sleeping
places
to
the
*NL*
lower
order
of
domestics
,
and
to
strangers
of
mean
degree
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
which
of
these
sleeps
the
Jew
?
''
said
the
Pilgrim
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
unbelieving
dog
,
''
answered
Anwold
,
``
kennels
in
the
cell
next
your
*NL*
holiness

--
St
Dunstan
,
how
it
must
be
scraped
and
cleansed
ere
it
be
*NL*
again
fit
for
a
Christian
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
where
sleeps
Gurth
the
swineherd
?
''
said
the
stranger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gurth
,
''
replied
the
bondsman
,
``
sleeps
in
the
cell
on
your
right
,
as
the
*NL*
Jew
on
that
to
your
left
;
you
serve
to
keep
the
child
of
circumcision
*NL*
separate
from
the
abomination
of
his
tribe
.
You
might
have
occupied
a
*NL*
more
honourable
place
had
you
accepted
of
Oswald
's
invitation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
as
well
as
it
is
,
''
said
the
Palmer
;
``
the
company
,
even
of
a
Jew
,
*NL*
can
hardly
spread
contamination
through
an
oaken
partition
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
he
entered
the
cabin
allotted
to
him
,
and
taking
the
torch
*NL*
from
the
domestic
's
hand
,
thanked
him
,
and
wished
him
good-night
.
Having
*NL*
shut
the
door
of
his
cell
,
he
placed
the
torch
in
a
candlestick
made
of
*NL*
wood
,
and
looked
around
his
sleeping
apartment
,
the
furniture
of
which
*NL*
was
of
the
most
simple
kind
.
It
consisted
of
a
rude
wooden
stool
,
*NL*
and
still
ruder
hutch
or
bed-frame
,
stuffed
with
clean
straw
,
and
*NL*
accommodated
with
two
or
three
sheepskins
by
way
of
bed-clothes
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Palmer
,
having
extinguished
his
torch
,
threw
himself
,
without
taking
*NL*
off
any
part
of
his
clothes
,
on
this
rude
couch
,
and
slept
,
or
at
least
*NL*
retained
his
recumbent
posture
,
till
the
earliest
sunbeams
found
their
*NL*
way
through
the
little
grated
window
,
which
served
at
once
to
admit
both
*NL*
air
and
light
to
his
uncomfortable
cell
.
He
then
started
up
,
and
after
*NL*
repeating
his
matins
,
and
adjusting
his
dress
,
he
left
it
,
and
entered
*NL*
that
of
Isaac
the
Jew
,
lifting
the
latch
as
gently
as
he
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
inmate
was
lying
in
troubled
slumber
upon
a
couch
similar
to
that
on
*NL*
which
the
Palmer
himself
had
passed
the
night
.
Such
parts
of
his
dress
*NL*
as
the
Jew
had
laid
aside
on
the
preceding
evening
,
were
disposed
*NL*
carefully
around
his
person
,
as
if
to
prevent
the
hazard
of
their
*NL*
being
carried
off
during
his
slumbers
.
There
was
a
trouble
on
his
brow
*NL*
amounting
almost
to
agony
.
His
hands
and
arms
moved
convulsively
,
as
*NL*
if
struggling
with
the
nightmare
;
and
besides
several
ejaculations
in
*NL*
Hebrew
,
the
following
were
distinctly
heard
in
the
Norman-English
,
or
*NL*
mixed
language
of
the
country
:
``
For
the
sake
of
the
God
of
Abraham
,
*NL*
spare
an
unhappy
old
man
!
I
am
poor
,
I
am
penniless
--
should
your
irons
*NL*
wrench
my
limbs
asunder
,
I
could
not
gratify
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Palmer
awaited
not
the
end
of
the
Jew
's
vision
,
but
stirred
him
with
*NL*
his
pilgrim
's
staff
.
The
touch
probably
associated
,
as
is
usual
,
with
*NL*
some
of
the
apprehensions
excited
by
his
dream
;
for
the
old
man
started
*NL*
up
,
his
grey
hair
standing
almost
erect
upon
his
head
,
and
huddling
some
*NL*
part
of
his
garments
about
him
,
while
he
held
the
detached
pieces
with
*NL*
the
tenacious
grasp
of
a
falcon
,
he
fixed
upon
the
Palmer
his
keen
black
*NL*
eyes
,
expressive
of
wild
surprise
and
of
bodily
apprehension
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fear
nothing
from
me
,
Isaac
,
''
said
the
Palmer
,
``
I
come
as
your
friend

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
God
of
Israel
requite
you
,
''
said
the
Jew
,
greatly
relieved
;
``
I
*NL*
dreamed
--
But
Father
Abraham
be
praised
,
it
was
but
a
dream
.
''
Then
,
*NL*
collecting
himself
,
he
added
in
his
usual
tone
,
``
And
what
may
it
be
your
*NL*
pleasure
to
want
at
so
early
an
hour
with
the
poor
Jew
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
to
tell
you
,
''
said
the
Palmer
,
``
that
if
you
leave
not
this
*NL*
mansion
instantly
,
and
travel
not
with
some
haste
,
your
journey
may
*NL*
prove
a
dangerous
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Holy
father
!
''
said
the
Jew
,
``
whom
could
it
interest
to
endanger
so
poor
*NL*
a
wretch
as
I
am
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
purpose
you
can
best
guess
,
''
said
the
Pilgrim
;
``
but
rely
on
this
,
*NL*
that
when
the
Templar
crossed
the
hall
yesternight
,
he
spoke
to
his
*NL*
Mussulman
slaves
in
the
Saracen
language
,
which
I
well
understand
,
and
*NL*
charged
them
this
morning
to
watch
the
journey
of
the
Jew
,
to
seize
upon
*NL*
him
when
at
a
convenient
distance
from
the
mansion
,
and
to
conduct
*NL*
him
to
the
castle
of
Philip
de
Malvoisin
,
or
to
that
of
Reginald
*NL*
Front-de-Boeuf
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
impossible
to
describe
the
extremity
of
terror
which
seized
upon
*NL*
the
Jew
at
this
information
,
and
seemed
at
once
to
overpower
his
whole
*NL*
faculties
.
His
arms
fell
down
to
his
sides
,
and
his
head
drooped
on
his
*NL*
breast
,
his
knees
bent
under
his
weight
,
every
nerve
and
muscle
of
his
*NL*
frame
seemed
to
collapse
and
lose
its
energy
,
and
he
sunk
at
the
foot
of
*NL*
the
Palmer
,
not
in
the
fashion
of
one
who
intentionally
stoops
,
kneels
,
*NL*
or
prostrates
himself
to
excite
compassion
,
but
like
a
man
borne
down
on
*NL*
all
sides
by
the
pressure
of
some
invisible
force
,
which
crushes
him
to
*NL*
the
earth
without
the
power
of
resistance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Holy
God
of
Abraham
!
''
was
his
first
exclamation
,
folding
and
elevating
*NL*
his
wrinkled
hands
,
but
without
raising
his
grey
head
from
the
pavement
;
*NL*
``
Oh
,
holy
Moses
!
O
,
blessed
Aaron
!
the
dream
is
not
dreamed
for
nought
,
*NL*
and
the
vision
cometh
not
in
vain
!
I
feel
their
irons
already
tear
my
*NL*
sinews
!
I
feel
the
rack
pass
over
my
body
like
the
saws
,
and
harrows
,
*NL*
and
axes
of
iron
over
the
men
of
Rabbah
,
and
of
the
cities
of
the
*NL*
children
of
Ammon
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stand
up
,
Isaac
,
and
hearken
to
me
,
''
said
the
Palmer
,
who
viewed
*NL*
the
extremity
of
his
distress
with
a
compassion
in
which
contempt
was
*NL*
largely
mingled
;
``
you
have
cause
for
your
terror
,
considering
how
your
*NL*
brethren
have
been
used
,
in
order
to
extort
from
them
their
hoards
,
both
*NL*
by
princes
and
nobles
;
but
stand
up
,
I
say
,
and
I
will
point
out
to
you
*NL*
the
means
of
escape
.
Leave
this
mansion
instantly
,
while
its
inmates
*NL*
sleep
sound
after
the
last
night
's
revel
.
I
will
guide
you
by
the
secret
*NL*
paths
of
the
forest
,
known
as
well
to
me
as
to
any
forester
that
ranges
*NL*
it
,
and
I
will
not
leave
you
till
you
are
under
safe
conduct
of
some
*NL*
chief
or
baron
going
to
the
tournament
,
whose
good-will
you
have
*NL*
probably
the
means
of
securing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
ears
of
Isaac
received
the
hopes
of
escape
which
this
speech
*NL*
intimated
,
he
began
gradually
,
and
inch
by
inch
,
as
it
were
,
to
raise
*NL*
himself
up
from
the
ground
,
until
he
fairly
rested
upon
his
knees
,
*NL*
throwing
back
his
long
grey
hair
and
beard
,
and
fixing
his
keen
black
*NL*
eyes
upon
the
Palmer
's
face
,
with
a
look
expressive
at
once
of
hope
and
*NL*
fear
,
not
unmingled
with
suspicion
.
But
when
he
heard
the
concluding
*NL*
part
of
the
sentence
,
his
original
terror
appeared
to
revive
in
full
*NL*
force
,
and
he
dropt
once
more
on
his
face
,
exclaiming
,
''
`
I
'
possess
the
*NL*
means
of
securing
good-will
!
alas
!
there
is
but
one
road
to
the
favour
*NL*
of
a
Christian
,
and
how
can
the
poor
Jew
find
it
,
whom
extortions
have
*NL*
already
reduced
to
the
misery
of
Lazarus
?
''
Then
,
as
if
suspicion
had
*NL*
overpowered
his
other
feelings
,
he
suddenly
exclaimed
,
``
For
the
love
of
*NL*
God
,
young
man
,
betray
me
not
--
for
the
sake
of
the
Great
Father
who
*NL*
made
us
all
,
Jew
as
well
as
Gentile
,
Israelite
and
Ishmaelite
--
do
me
no
*NL*
treason
!
I
have
not
means
to
secure
the
good-will
of
a
Christian
beggar
,
*NL*
were
he
rating
it
at
a
single
penny
.
''
As
he
spoke
these
last
words
,
he
*NL*
raised
himself
,
and
grasped
the
Palmer
's
mantle
with
a
look
of
the
*NL*
most
earnest
entreaty
.
The
pilgrim
extricated
himself
,
as
if
there
were
*NL*
contamination
in
the
touch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wert
thou
loaded
with
all
the
wealth
of
thy
tribe
,
''
he
said
,
``
what
*NL*
interest
have
I
to
injure
thee
?
--
In
this
dress
I
am
vowed
to
poverty
,
*NL*
nor
do
I
change
it
for
aught
save
a
horse
and
a
coat
of
mail
.
Yet
think
*NL*
not
that
I
care
for
thy
company
,
or
propose
myself
advantage
by
it
;
*NL*
remain
here
if
thou
wilt
--
Cedric
the
Saxon
may
protect
thee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
!
''
said
the
Jew
,
``
he
will
not
let
me
travel
in
his
train
--
Saxon
or
*NL*
Norman
will
be
equally
ashamed
of
the
poor
Israelite
;
and
to
travel
*NL*
by
myself
through
the
domains
of
Philip
de
Malvoisin
and
Reginald
*NL*
Front-de-Boeuf
--
Good
youth
,
I
will
go
with
you

Let

haste

us
gird
up
our
loins

Here
is
thy
staff
,
why
wilt
thou
*NL*
tarry
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tarry
not
,
''
said
the
Pilgrim
,
giving
way
to
the
urgency
of
his
*NL*
companion
;
``
but
I
must
secure
the
means
of
leaving
this
place
--
follow
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
led
the
way
to
the
adjoining
cell
,
which
,
as
the
reader
is
apprised
,
*NL*
was
occupied
by
Gurth
the
swineherd
.
--
``
Arise
,
Gurth
,
''
said
the
Pilgrim
,
*NL*
``
arise
quickly
.
Undo
the
postern
gate
,
and
let
out
the
Jew
and
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gurth
,
whose
occupation
,
though
now
held
so
mean
,
gave
him
as
much
*NL*
consequence
in
Saxon
England
as
that
of
Eumaeus
in
Ithaca
,
was
offended
*NL*
at
the
familiar
and
commanding
tone
assumed
by
the
Palmer
.
``
The
Jew
*NL*
leaving
Rotherwood
,
''
said
he
,
raising
himself
on
his
elbow
,
and
looking
*NL*
superciliously
at
him
without
quitting
his
pallet
,
``
and
travelling
in
*NL*
company
with
the
Palmer
to
boot
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
as
soon
have
dreamt
,
''
said
Wamba
,
who
entered
the
apartment
at
*NL*
the
instant
,
``
of
his
stealing
away
with
a
gammon
of
bacon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nevertheless
,
''
said
Gurth
,
again
laying
down
his
head
on
the
wooden
log
*NL*
which
served
him
for
a
pillow
,
``
both
Jew
and
Gentile
must
be
content
to
*NL*
abide
the
opening
of
the
great
gate
--
we
suffer
no
visitors
to
depart
by
*NL*
stealth
at
these
unseasonable
hours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nevertheless
,
''
said
the
Pilgrim
,
in
a
commanding
tone
,
``
you
will
not
,
I
*NL*
think
,
refuse
me
that
favour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
he
stooped
over
the
bed
of
the
recumbent
swineherd
,
and
*NL*
whispered
something
in
his
ear
in
Saxon
.
Gurth
started
up
as
if
*NL*
electrified
.
The
Pilgrim
,
raising
his
finger
in
an
attitude
as
if
to
*NL*
express
caution
,
added
,
``
Gurth
,
beware
--
thou
are
wont
to
be
prudent
.
I
*NL*
say
,
undo
the
postern
--
thou
shalt
know
more
anon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
hasty
alacrity
Gurth
obeyed
him
,
while
Wamba
and
the
Jew
followed
,
*NL*
both
wondering
at
the
sudden
change
in
the
swineherd
's
demeanour
.
``
My
*NL*
mule
,
my
mule
!
''
said
the
Jew
,
as
soon
as
they
stood
without
the
postern
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fetch
him
his
mule
,
''
said
the
Pilgrim
;
``
and
,
hearest
thou
,
--
let
me
have
*NL*
another
,
that
I
may
bear
him
company
till
he
is
beyond
these
parts
--
I
*NL*
will
return
it
safely
to
some
of
Cedric
's
train
at
Ashby
.
And
do
*NL*
thou
''
--
he
whispered
the
rest
in
Gurth
's
ear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Willingly
,
most
willingly
shall
it
be
done
,
''
said
Gurth
,
and
instantly
*NL*
departed
to
execute
the
commission
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
I
knew
,
''
said
Wamba
,
when
his
comrade
's
back
was
turned
,
``
what
*NL*
you
Palmers
learn
in
the
Holy
Land
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
say
our
orisons
,
fool
,
''
answered
the
Pilgrim
,
``
to
repent
our
sins
,
*NL*
and
to
mortify
ourselves
with
fastings
,
vigils
,
and
long
prayers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Something
more
potent
than
that
,
''
answered
the
Jester
;
``
for
when
would
*NL*
repentance
or
prayer
make
Gurth
do
a
courtesy
,
or
fasting
or
vigil
*NL*
persuade
him
to
lend
you
a
mule
?
--
I
trow
you
might
as
well
have
told
his
*NL*
favourite
black
boar
of
thy
vigils
and
penance
,
and
wouldst
have
gotten
*NL*
as
civil
an
answer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
to
,
''
said
the
Pilgrim
,
``
thou
art
but
a
Saxon
fool
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
sayst
well
,
''
said
the
Jester
;
``
had
I
been
born
a
Norman
,
as
I
*NL*
think
thou
art
,
I
would
have
had
luck
on
my
side
,
and
been
next
door
to
*NL*
a
wise
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
Gurth
appeared
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
moat
with
the
*NL*
mules
.
The
travellers
crossed
the
ditch
upon
a
drawbridge
of
only
two
*NL*
planks
breadth
,
the
narrowness
of
which
was
matched
with
the
straitness
*NL*
of
the
postern
,
and
with
a
little
wicket
in
the
exterior
palisade
,
which
*NL*
gave
access
to
the
forest
.
No
sooner
had
they
reached
the
mules
,
than
*NL*
the
Jew
,
with
hasty
and
trembling
hands
,
secured
behind
the
saddle
*NL*
a
small
bag
of
blue
buckram
,
which
he
took
from
under
his
cloak
,
*NL*
containing
,
as
he
muttered
,
``
a
change
of
raiment
--
only
a
change
of
*NL*
raiment
.
''
Then
getting
upon
the
animal
with
more
alacrity
and
haste
*NL*
than
could
have
been
anticipated
from
his
years
,
he
lost
no
time
in
so
*NL*
disposing
of
the
skirts
of
his
gabardine
as
to
conceal
completely
from
*NL*
observation
the
burden
which
he
had
thus
deposited
``
en
croupe
''
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Pilgrim
mounted
with
more
deliberation
,
reaching
,
as
he
departed
,
*NL*
his
hand
to
Gurth
,
who
kissed
it
with
the
utmost
possible
veneration
.
*NL*
The
swineherd
stood
gazing
after
the
travellers
until
they
were
lost
*NL*
under
the
boughs
of
the
forest
path
,
when
he
was
disturbed
from
his
*NL*
reverie
by
the
voice
of
Wamba
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Knowest
thou
,
''
said
the
Jester
,
``
my
good
friend
Gurth
,
that
thou
art
*NL*
strangely
courteous
and
most
unwontedly
pious
on
this
summer
morning
?
I
*NL*
would
I
were
a
black
Prior
or
a
barefoot
Palmer
,
to
avail
myself
of
thy
*NL*
unwonted
zeal
and
courtesy
--
certes
,
I
would
make
more
out
of
it
than
a
*NL*
kiss
of
the
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
art
no
fool
thus
far
,
Wamba
,
''
answered
Gurth
,
``
though
thou
arguest
*NL*
from
appearances
,
and
the
wisest
of
us
can
do
no
more
--
But
it
is
time
to
*NL*
look
after
my
charge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
he
turned
back
to
the
mansion
,
attended
by
the
Jester
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
the
travellers
continued
to
press
on
their
journey
with
a
*NL*
dispatch
which
argued
the
extremity
of
the
Jew
's
fears
,
since
persons
at
*NL*
his
age
are
seldom
fond
of
rapid
motion
.
The
Palmer
,
to
whom
every
path
*NL*
and
outlet
in
the
wood
appeared
to
be
familiar
,
led
the
way
through
the
*NL*
most
devious
paths
,
and
more
than
once
excited
anew
the
suspicion
of
*NL*
the
Israelite
,
that
he
intended
to
betray
him
into
some
ambuscade
of
his
*NL*
enemies
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
doubts
might
have
been
indeed
pardoned
;
for
,
except
perhaps
the
*NL*
flying
fish
,
there
was
no
race
existing
on
the
earth
,
in
the
air
,
or
*NL*
the
waters
,
who
were
the
object
of
such
an
unintermitting
,
general
,
and
*NL*
relentless
persecution
as
the
Jews
of
this
period
.
Upon
the
slightest
*NL*
and
most
unreasonable
pretences
,
as
well
as
upon
accusations
the
most
*NL*
absurd
and
groundless
,
their
persons
and
property
were
exposed
to
every
*NL*
turn
of
popular
fury
;
for
Norman
,
Saxon
,
Dane
,
and
Briton
,
however
*NL*
adverse
these
races
were
to
each
other
,
contended
which
should
look
with
*NL*
greatest
detestation
upon
a
people
,
whom
it
was
accounted
a
point
of
*NL*
religion
to
hate
,
to
revile
,
to
despise
,
to
plunder
,
and
to
persecute
.
*NL*
The
kings
of
the
Norman
race
,
and
the
independent
nobles
,
who
followed
*NL*
their
example
in
all
acts
of
tyranny
,
maintained
against
this
devoted
*NL*
people
a
persecution
of
a
more
regular
,
calculated
,
and
self-interested
*NL*
kind
.
It
is
a
well-known
story
of
King
John
,
that
he
confined
a
wealthy
*NL*
Jew
in
one
of
the
royal
castles
,
and
daily
caused
one
of
his
teeth
to
*NL*
be
torn
out
,
until
,
when
the
jaw
of
the
unhappy
Israelite
was
half
*NL*
disfurnished
,
he
consented
to
pay
a
large
sum
,
which
it
was
the
tyrant
's
*NL*
object
to
extort
from
him
.
The
little
ready
money
which
was
in
the
*NL*
country
was
chiefly
in
possession
of
this
persecuted
people
,
and
the
*NL*
nobility
hesitated
not
to
follow
the
example
of
their
sovereign
,
in
*NL*
wringing
it
from
them
by
every
species
of
oppression
,
and
even
personal
*NL*
torture
.
Yet
the
passive
courage
inspired
by
the
love
of
gain
,
induced
*NL*
the
Jews
to
dare
the
various
evils
to
which
they
were
subjected
,
in
*NL*
consideration
of
the
immense
profits
which
they
were
enabled
to
realize
*NL*
in
a
country
naturally
so
wealthy
as
England
.
In
spite
of
every
kind
*NL*
of
discouragement
,
and
even
of
the
special
court
of
taxations
already
*NL*
mentioned
,
called
the
Jews
'
Exchequer
,
erected
for
the
very
purpose
of
*NL*
despoiling
and
distressing
them
,
the
Jews
increased
,
multiplied
,
and
*NL*
accumulated
huge
sums
,
which
they
transferred
from
one
hand
to
another
*NL*
by
means
of
bills
of
exchange
--
an
invention
for
which
commerce
is
said
*NL*
to
be
indebted
to
them
,
and
which
enabled
them
to
transfer
their
wealth
*NL*
from
land
to
land
,
that
when
threatened
with
oppression
in
one
country
,
*NL*
their
treasure
might
be
secured
in
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
obstinacy
and
avarice
of
the
Jews
being
thus
in
a
measure
placed
*NL*
in
opposition
to
the
fanaticism
that
tyranny
of
those
under
whom
they
*NL*
lived
,
seemed
to
increase
in
proportion
to
the
persecution
with
which
*NL*
they
were
visited
;
and
the
immense
wealth
they
usually
acquired
in
*NL*
commerce
,
while
it
frequently
placed
them
in
danger
,
was
at
other
times
*NL*
used
to
extend
their
influence
,
and
to
secure
to
them
a
certain
*NL*
degree
of
protection
.
On
these
terms
they
lived
;
and
their
character
,
*NL*
influenced
accordingly
,
was
watchful
,
suspicious
,
and
timid
--
yet
*NL*
obstinate
,
uncomplying
,
and
skilful
in
evading
the
dangers
to
which
they
*NL*
were
exposed
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
travellers
had
pushed
on
at
a
rapid
rate
through
many
devious
*NL*
paths
,
the
Palmer
at
length
broke
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
large
decayed
oak
,
''
he
said
,
``
marks
the
boundaries
over
which
*NL*
Front-de-Boeuf
claims
authority
--
we
are
long
since
far
from
those
of
*NL*
Malvoisin
.
There
is
now
no
fear
of
pursuit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
the
wheels
of
their
chariots
be
taken
off
,
''
said
the
Jew
,
``
like
*NL*
those
of
the
host
of
Pharaoh
,
that
they
may
drive
heavily
!
--
But
leave
me
*NL*
not
,

Pilgrim

Think
but
of
that
fierce
and
savage
Templar
,
with
*NL*
his
Saracen
slaves
--
they
will
regard
neither
territory
,
nor
manor
,
nor
*NL*
lordship
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
road
,
''
said
the
Palmer
,
``
should
here
separate
;
for
it
beseems
not
*NL*

my

thine
to
travel
together
longer

needs
must
*NL*
be
.
Besides
,
what
succour
couldst
thou
have
from
me

a
peaceful
Pilgrim
,
*NL*
against
two
armed
heathens
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O

answered
the
Jew
,
``

Poor

I
am

I

*NL*
*NL*
``
Money

said
the
Palmer
,
interrupting
him
,
``
I
have

already
said

even
in
some

;
since
to
protect
a
Jew
against
a
Saracen
,
*NL*
can
scarce
be
accounted
unworthy
of
a
Christian
.
Therefore

Jew
,
I
will
*NL*
see
thee
safe
under
some
fitting
escort
.
We
are
now
not

from

mayest
easily

*NL*
*NL*
``
The

the
Jew
;

Sheffield
I

*NL*
*NL*
``
Be

the
Palmer
;

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
half
hour
was
spent
in
perfect
silence
on
both
parts
;
the
Pilgrim
*NL*
perhaps
disdaining
to
address
the
Jew
,
except
in
case
of
absolute
*NL*
necessity
,
and
the
Jew
not
presuming
to
force
a
conversation
with
a
*NL*
person
whose
journey
to
the
Holy
Sepulchre
gave
a
sort
of
sanctity
to
*NL*
his
character
.
They
paused
on
the
top
of
a
gently
rising
bank
,
and
the
*NL*
Pilgrim
,
pointing
to
the
town
of
Sheffield
,
which
lay
beneath
them
,
*NL*
repeated
the
words

``
Here

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

the

The
Palmer
started
,
and
turned
suddenly
towards
the
Jew
:
--
``
What
fiend
*NL*
prompted
that
guess

said
he
,
hastily

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

said
the
Jew

smiling

``
so

the

*NL*

*NL*

sparks
from

showed
*NL*
the
metal
within
;

in
the
bosom
of
that
Palmer
's
gown
,
is
hidden
a
*NL*
knight

chain
and
spurs
of
gold

They
glanced
as
you
stooped
over
my
*NL*
bed
in
the
morning

*NL*
*NL*
The
Pilgrim
could
not
forbear
smiling
.
``
Were
thy
garments
searched
by
as
*NL*
curious
an
eye

Isaac

said
he
,
``
what
discoveries
might
not
be
made
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
more
of
that
,
''
said
the
Jew
,
changing
colour
;
and
drawing
forth
his
*NL*
writing
materials
in
haste
,
as
if
to
stop
the
conversation
,
he
began
to
*NL*
write
upon
a
piece
of
paper
which
he
supported
on
the
top
of
his
*NL*
yellow
cap
,
without
dismounting
from
his
mule
.
When
he
had
finished
,
he
*NL*
delivered
the
scroll
,
which
was
in
the
Hebrew
character
,
to
the
Pilgrim
,
*NL*
saying
,
``
In

town

Lombardy

him
this
scroll

he
hath
on
sale
six
Milan
*NL*
harnesses
,
the
worst
would
suit
a
crowned
head
--
ten
goodly
steeds
,
the
*NL*
worst
might
mount
a
king
,
were
he
to
do
battle
for
his
throne

Of
these
*NL*
he
will
give
thee
thy
choice

with
every
thing
else
that
can
furnish
*NL*
thee
forth
for

tournament

when

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Isaac

said
the
Pilgrim
,
smiling
,
``
dost
thou
know
that
in
these
*NL*
sports

forfeit

Now
I
may
be
unfortunate

so
lose
what
I

*NL*
*NL*
The
Jew
looked
somewhat
astounded
at
this
possibility
;
but
collecting
*NL*
his
courage
,
he
replied
hastily
.
``
No

no

no

impossible

*NL*
not

Thy
lance
*NL*
will
be
powerful
as

*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
he
was
turning
his
mule
's
head
away
,
when
the
Palmer
,
in
his
*NL*
turn
,
took
hold
of
his
gaberdine
.
``
Nay

thou
knowest

injured

will
spare

Besides

nothing

*NL*
nothing

something
there
must
be
paid
for

use

*NL*
*NL*
The
Jew
twisted
himself
in
the
saddle
,
like
a
man
in
a
fit
of
the
colic
;
*NL*
but
his
better
feelings
predominated
over
those
which
were
most
familiar
*NL*
to
him
.
``
I
care
not

he
said
,
``
I
care
not

let
me
go

If

cost
you
nothing

Kirjath

Jairam
will
forgive
it
for

Fare
thee

hark
thee

said
he
,
turning
about
,
``
thrust
*NL*
thyself

too
forward

hurly-burly

I

*NL*
*NL*
``
Gramercy

the

again
smiling
;

*NL*
*NL*
The
condition
of
the
English
nation
was
at
this
time
sufficiently
*NL*
miserable
.
King
Richard
was
absent
a
prisoner
,
and
in
the
power
of
*NL*
the
perfidious
and
cruel
Duke
of
Austria
.
Even
the
very
place
of
his
*NL*
captivity
was
uncertain
,
and
his
fate
but
very
imperfectly
known
to
the
*NL*
generality
of
his
subjects
,
who
were
,
in
the
meantime
,
a
prey
to
every
*NL*
species
of
subaltern
oppression
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
John
,
in
league
with
Philip
of
France
,
Coeur-de-Lion
's
mortal
*NL*
enemy
,
was
using
every
species
of
influence
with
the
Duke
of
Austria
,
to
*NL*
prolong
the
captivity
of
his
brother
Richard
,
to
whom
he
stood
indebted
*NL*
for
so
many
favours
.
In
the
meantime
,
he
was
strengthening
his
own
*NL*
faction
in
the
kingdom
,
of
which
he
proposed
to
dispute
the
succession
,
*NL*
in
case
of
the
King
's
death
,
with
the
legitimate
heir
,
Arthur
Duke
of
*NL*
Brittany
,
son
of
Geoffrey
Plantagenet
,
the
elder
brother
of
John
.
This
*NL*
usurpation
,
it
is
well
known
,
he
afterwards
effected
.
His
own
character
*NL*
being
light
,
profligate
,
and
perfidious
,
John
easily
attached
to
his
*NL*
person
and
faction
,
not
only
all
who
had
reason
to
dread
the
resentment
*NL*
of
Richard
for
criminal
proceedings
during
his
absence
,
but
also
the
*NL*
numerous
class
of
``
lawless
resolutes
,
''
whom
the
crusades
had
turned
back
*NL*
on
their
country
,
accomplished
in
the
vices
of
the
East
,
impoverished
*NL*
in
substance
,
and
hardened
in
character
,
and
who
placed
their
hopes
*NL*
of
harvest
in
civil
commotion
.
To
these
causes
of
public
distress
and
*NL*
apprehension
,
must
be
added
,
the
multitude
of
outlaws
,
who
,
driven
*NL*
to
despair
by
the
oppression
of
the
feudal
nobility
,
and
the
severe
*NL*
exercise
of
the
forest
laws
,
banded
together
in
large
gangs
,
and
,
*NL*
keeping
possession
of
the
forests
and
the
wastes
,
set
at
defiance
the
*NL*
justice
and
magistracy
of
the
country
.
The
nobles
themselves
,
each
*NL*
fortified
within
his
own
castle
,
and
playing
the
petty
sovereign
over
*NL*
his
own
dominions
,
were
the
leaders
of
bands
scarce
less
lawless
and
*NL*
oppressive
than
those
of
the
avowed
depredators
.
To
maintain
these
*NL*
retainers
,
and
to
support
the
extravagance
and
magnificence
which
their
*NL*
pride
induced
them
to
affect
,
the
nobility
borrowed
sums
of
money
from
*NL*
the
Jews
at
the
most
usurious
interest
,
which
gnawed
into
their
estates
*NL*
like
consuming
cankers
,
scarce
to
be
cured
unless
when
circumstances
*NL*
gave
them
an
opportunity
of
getting
free
,
by
exercising
upon
their
*NL*
creditors
some
act
of
unprincipled
violence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Under
the
various
burdens
imposed
by
this
unhappy
state
of
affairs
,
*NL*
the
people
of
England
suffered
deeply
for
the
present
,
and
had
yet
*NL*
more
dreadful
cause
to
fear
for
the
future
.
To
augment
their
misery
,
a
*NL*
contagious
disorder
of
a
dangerous
nature
spread
through
the
land
;
and
,
*NL*
rendered
more
virulent
by
the
uncleanness
,
the
indifferent
food
,
and
*NL*
the
wretched
lodging
of
the
lower
classes
,
swept
off
many
whose
fate
the
*NL*
survivors
were
tempted
to
envy
,
as
exempting
them
from
the
evils
which
*NL*
were
to
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
amid
these
accumulated
distresses
,
the
poor
as
well
as
the
rich
,
the
*NL*
vulgar
as
well
as
the
noble
,
in
the
event
of
a
tournament
,
which
was
the
*NL*
grand
spectacle
of
that
age
,
felt
as
much
interested
as
the
half-starved
*NL*
citizen
of
Madrid
,
who
has
not
a
real
left
to
buy
provisions
for
his
*NL*
family
,
feels
in
the
issue
of
a
bull-feast
.
Neither
duty
nor
infirmity
*NL*
could
keep
youth
or
age
from
such
exhibitions
.
The
Passage
of
Arms
,
*NL*
as
it
was
called
,
which
was
to
take
place
at
Ashby
,
in
the
county
of
*NL*
Leicester
,
as
champions
of
the
first
renown
were
to
take
the
field
*NL*
in
the
presence
of
Prince
John
himself
,
who
was
expected
to
grace
the
*NL*
lists
,
had
attracted
universal
attention
,
and
an
immense
confluence
of
*NL*
persons
of
all
ranks
hastened
upon
the
appointed
morning
to
the
place
of
*NL*
combat
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
scene
was
singularly
romantic
.
On
the
verge
of
a
wood
,
which
*NL*
approached
to
within
a
mile
of
the
town
of
Ashby
,
was
an
extensive
*NL*
meadow
,
of
the
finest
and
most
beautiful
green
turf
,
surrounded
on
one
*NL*
side
by
the
forest
,
and
fringed
on
the
other
by
straggling
oak-trees
,
*NL*
some
of
which
had
grown
to
an
immense
size
.
The
ground
,
as
if
fashioned
*NL*
on
purpose
for
the
martial
display
which
was
intended
,
sloped
gradually
*NL*
down
on
all
sides
to
a
level
bottom
,
which
was
enclosed
for
the
lists
*NL*
with
strong
palisades
,
forming
a
space
of
a
quarter
of
a
mile
in
length
,
*NL*
and
about
half
as
broad
.
The
form
of
the
enclosure
was
an
oblong
square
,
*NL*
save
that
the
corners
were
considerably
rounded
off
,
in
order
to
afford
*NL*
more
convenience
for
the
spectators
.
The
openings
for
the
entry
of
the
*NL*
combatants
were
at
the
northern
and
southern
extremities
of
the
lists
,
*NL*
accessible
by
strong
wooden
gates
,
each
wide
enough
to
admit
two
*NL*
horsemen
riding
abreast
.
At
each
of
these
portals
were
stationed
two
*NL*
heralds
,
attended
by
six
trumpets
,
as
many
pursuivants
,
and
a
strong
*NL*
body
of
men-at-arms
for
maintaining
order
,
and
ascertaining
the
quality
*NL*
of
the
knights
who
proposed
to
engage
in
this
martial
game
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
a
platform
beyond
the
southern
entrance
,
formed
by
a
natural
*NL*
elevation
of
the
ground
,
were
pitched
five
magnificent
pavilions
,
*NL*
adorned
with
pennons
of
russet
and
black
,
the
chosen
colours
of
the
five
*NL*
knights
challengers
.
The
cords
of
the
tents
were
of
the
same
colour
.
*NL*
Before
each
pavilion
was
suspended
the
shield
of
the
knight
by
whom
it
*NL*
was
occupied
,
and
beside
it
stood
his
squire
,
quaintly
disguised
as
a
*NL*
salvage
or
silvan
man
,
or
in
some
other
fantastic
dress
,
according
to
*NL*
the
taste
of
his
master
,
and
the
character
he
was
pleased
to
assume
*NL*
during
the
game
.

The
central
pavilion
,
as
the
place
of
honour
,
had
been
assigned
to
Brian
*NL*
be
Bois-Guilbert
,
whose
renown
in
all
games
of
chivalry
,
no
less
than
*NL*
his
connexions
with
the
knights
who
had
undertaken
this
Passage
of
*NL*
Arms
,
had
occasioned
him
to
be
eagerly
received
into
the
company
of
the
*NL*
challengers
,
and
even
adopted
as
their
chief
and
leader
,
though
he
had
*NL*
so
recently
joined
them
.
On
one
side
of
his
tent
were
pitched
those
of
*NL*
Reginald
Front-de-Boeuf
and
Richard
de
Malvoisin
,
and
on
the
other
was
*NL*
the
pavilion
of
Hugh
de
Grantmesnil
,
a
noble
baron
in
the
vicinity
,
*NL*
whose
ancestor
had
been
Lord
High
Steward
of
England
in
the
time
of
the
*NL*
Conqueror
,
and
his
son
William
Rufus
.
Ralph
de
Vipont
,
a
knight
of
St
*NL*
John
of
Jerusalem
,
who
had
some
ancient
possessions
at
a
place
called
*NL*
Heather
,
near
Ashby-de-la-Zouche
,
occupied
the
fifth
pavilion
.
From
the
*NL*
entrance
into
the
lists
,
a
gently
sloping
passage
,
ten
yards
in
breadth
,
*NL*
led
up
to
the
platform
on
which
the
tents
were
pitched
.
It
was
strongly
*NL*
secured
by
a
palisade
on
each
side
,
as
was
the
esplanade
in
front
of
the
*NL*
pavilions
,
and
the
whole
was
guarded
by
men-at-arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
northern
access
to
the
lists
terminated
in
a
similar
entrance
of
*NL*
thirty
feet
in
breadth
,
at
the
extremity
of
which
was
a
large
enclosed
*NL*
space
for
such
knights
as
might
be
disposed
to
enter
the
lists
with
the
*NL*
challengers
,
behind
which
were
placed
tents
containing
refreshments
of
*NL*
every
kind
for
their
accommodation
,
with
armourers
,
tarriers
,
and
other
*NL*
attendants
,
in
readiness
to
give
their
services
wherever
they
might
be
*NL*
necessary
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
exterior
of
the
lists
was
in
part
occupied
by
temporary
galleries
,
*NL*
spread
with
tapestry
and
carpets
,
and
accommodated
with
cushions
for
the
*NL*
convenience
of
those
ladies
and
nobles
who
were
expected
to
attend
the
*NL*
tournament
.
A
narrow
space
,
betwixt
these
galleries
and
the
lists
,
gave
*NL*
accommodation
for
yeomanry
and
spectators
of
a
better
degree
than
*NL*
the
mere
vulgar
,
and
might
be
compared
to
the
pit
of
a
theatre
.
The
*NL*
promiscuous
multitude
arranged
themselves
upon
large
banks
of
turf
*NL*
prepared
for
the
purpose
,
which
,
aided
by
the
natural
elevation
of
the
*NL*
ground
,
enabled
them
to
overlook
the
galleries
,
and
obtain
a
fair
view
*NL*
into
the
lists
.
Besides
the
accommodation
which
these
stations
afforded
,
*NL*
many
hundreds
had
perched
themselves
on
the
branches
of
the
trees
which
*NL*
surrounded
the
meadow
;
and
even
the
steeple
of
a
country
church
,
at
some
*NL*
distance
,
was
crowded
with
spectators
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
only
remains
to
notice
respecting
the
general
arrangement
,
that
*NL*
one
gallery
in
the
very
centre
of
the
eastern
side
of
the
lists
,
and
*NL*
consequently
exactly
opposite
to
the
spot
where
the
shock
of
the
combat
*NL*
was
to
take
place
,
was
raised
higher
than
the
others
,
more
richly
*NL*
decorated
,
and
graced
by
a
sort
of
throne
and
canopy
,
on
which
the
*NL*
royal
arms
were
emblazoned
.
Squires
,
pages
,
and
yeomen
in
rich
liveries
,
*NL*
waited
around
this
place
of
honour
,
which
was
designed
for
Prince
John
*NL*
and
his
attendants
.
Opposite
to
this
royal
gallery
was
another
,
elevated
*NL*
to
the
same
height
,
on
the
western
side
of
the
lists
;
and
more
gaily
,
if
*NL*
less
sumptuously
decorated
,
than
that
destined
for
the
Prince
himself
.
*NL*
A
train
of
pages
and
of
young
maidens
,
the
most
beautiful
who
could
be
*NL*
selected
,
gaily
dressed
in
fancy
habits
of
green
and
pink
,
surrounded
*NL*
a
throne
decorated
in
the
same
colours
.
Among
pennons
and
flags
bearing
*NL*
wounded
hearts
,
burning
hearts
,
bleeding
hearts
,
bows
and
quivers
,
*NL*
and
all
the
commonplace
emblems
of
the
triumphs
of
Cupid
,
a
blazoned
*NL*
inscription
informed
the
spectators
,
that
this
seat
of
honour
was
*NL*
designed
for
``
La
Royne
de
las
Beaulte
et
des
Amours
''
.
But
who
was
to
*NL*
represent
the
Queen
of
Beauty
and
of
Love
on
the
present
occasion
no
one
*NL*
was
prepared
to
guess
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
spectators
of
every
description
thronged
forward
to
occupy
*NL*
their
respective
stations
,
and
not
without
many
quarrels
concerning
*NL*
those
which
they
were
entitled
to
hold
.
Some
of
these
were
settled
by
*NL*
the
men-at-arms
with
brief
ceremony
;
the
shafts
of
their
battle-axes
,
*NL*
and
pummels
of
their
swords
,
being
readily
employed
as
arguments
to
*NL*
convince
the
more
refractory
.
Others
,
which
involved
the
rival
claims
*NL*
of
more
elevated
persons
,
were
determined
by
the
heralds
,
or
by
the
two
*NL*
marshals
of
the
field
,
William
de
Wyvil
,
and
Stephen
de
Martival
,
who
,
*NL*
armed
at
all
points
,
rode
up
and
down
the
lists
to
enforce
and
preserve
*NL*
good
order
among
the
spectators
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gradually
the
galleries
became
filled
with
knights
and
nobles
,
in
their
*NL*
robes
of
peace
,
whose
long
and
rich-tinted
mantles
were
contrasted
with
*NL*
the
gayer
and
more
splendid
habits
of
the
ladies
,
who
,
in
a
greater
*NL*
proportion
than
even
the
men
themselves
,
thronged
to
witness
a
sport
,
*NL*
which
one
would
have
thought
too
bloody
and
dangerous
to
afford
their
*NL*
sex
much
pleasure
.
The
lower
and
interior
space
was
soon
filled
by
*NL*
substantial
yeomen
and
burghers
,
and
such
of
the
lesser
gentry
,
as
,
from
*NL*
modesty
,
poverty
,
or
dubious
title
,
durst
not
assume
any
higher
place
.
*NL*
It
was
of
course
amongst
these
that
the
most
frequent
disputes
for
*NL*
precedence
occurred
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dog
of
an
unbeliever
,
''
said
an
old
man
,
whose
threadbare
tunic
bore
*NL*
witness
to
his
poverty
,
as
his
sword
,
and
dagger
,
and
golden
chain
*NL*
intimated
his
pretensions
to
rank
,
--
``
whelp
of
a
she-wolf
!
darest
*NL*
thou
press
upon
a
Christian
,
and
a
Norman
gentleman
of
the
blood
of
*NL*
Montdidier
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
rough
expostulation
was
addressed
to
no
other
than
our
acquaintance
*NL*
Isaac
,
who
,
richly
and
even
magnificently
dressed
in
a
gaberdine
*NL*
ornamented
with
lace
and
lined
with
fur
,
was
endeavouring
to
make
place
*NL*
in
the
foremost
row
beneath
the
gallery
for
his
daughter
,
the
beautiful
*NL*
Rebecca
,
who
had
joined
him
at
Ashby
,
and
who
was
now
hanging
on
her
*NL*
father
's
arm
,
not
a
little
terrified
by
the
popular
displeasure
which
*NL*
seemed
generally
excited
by
her
parent
's
presumption
.
But
Isaac
,
though
*NL*
we
have
seen
him
sufficiently
timid
on
other
occasions
,
knew
well
that
*NL*
at
present
he
had
nothing
to
fear
.
It
was
not
in
places
of
general
*NL*
resort
,
or
where
their
equals
were
assembled
,
that
any
avaricious
or
*NL*
malevolent
noble
durst
offer
him
injury
.
At
such
meetings
the
Jews
*NL*
were
under
the
protection
of
the
general
law
;
and
if
that
proved
a
*NL*
weak
assurance
,
it
usually
happened
that
there
were
among
the
persons
*NL*
assembled
some
barons
,
who
,
for
their
own
interested
motives
,
were
ready
*NL*
to
act
as
their
protectors
.
On
the
present
occasion
,
Isaac
felt
more
*NL*
than
usually
confident
,
being
aware
that
Prince
John
was
even
then
in
*NL*
the
very
act
of
negotiating
a
large
loan
from
the
Jews
of
York
,
to
*NL*
be
secured
upon
certain
jewels
and
lands
.
Isaac
's
own
share
in
this
*NL*
transaction
was
considerable
,
and
he
well
knew
that
the
Prince
's
eager
*NL*
desire
to
bring
it
to
a
conclusion
would
ensure
him
his
protection
in
*NL*
the
dilemma
in
which
he
stood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emboldened
by
these
considerations
,
the
Jew
pursued
his
point
,
and
*NL*
jostled
the
Norman
Christian
,
without
respect
either
to
his
descent
,
*NL*
quality
,
or
religion
.
The
complaints
of
the
old
man
,
however
,
excited
*NL*
the
indignation
of
the
bystanders
.
One
of
these
,
a
stout
well-set
*NL*
yeoman
,
arrayed
in
Lincoln
green
,
having
twelve
arrows
stuck
in
his
*NL*
belt
,
with
a
baldric
and
badge
of
silver
,
and
a
bow
of
six
feet
length
*NL*
in
his
hand
,
turned
short
round
,
and
while
his
countenance
,
which
his
*NL*
constant
exposure
to
weather
had
rendered
brown
as
a
hazel
nut
,
grew
*NL*
darker
with
anger
,
he
advised
the
Jew
to
remember
that
all
the
wealth
*NL*
he
had
acquired
by
sucking
the
blood
of
his
miserable
victims
had
but
*NL*
swelled
him
like
a
bloated
spider
,
which
might
be
overlooked
while
he
*NL*
kept
in
a
corner
,
but
would
be
crushed
if
it
ventured
into
the
light
.
*NL*
This
intimation
,
delivered
in
Norman-English
with
a
firm
voice
and
*NL*
a
stern
aspect
,
made
the
Jew
shrink
back
;
and
he
would
have
probably
*NL*
withdrawn
himself
altogether
from
a
vicinity
so
dangerous
,
had
not
the
*NL*
attention
of
every
one
been
called
to
the
sudden
entrance
of
Prince
*NL*
John
,
who
at
that
moment
entered
the
lists
,
attended
by
a
numerous
and
*NL*
gay
train
,
consisting
partly
of
laymen
,
partly
of
churchmen
,
as
light
in
*NL*
their
dress
,
and
as
gay
in
their
demeanour
,
as
their
companions
.
Among
*NL*
the
latter
was
the
Prior
of
Jorvaulx
,
in
the
most
gallant
trim
which
a
*NL*
dignitary
of
the
church
could
venture
to
exhibit
.
Fur
and
gold
were
not
*NL*
spared
in
his
garments
;
and
the
points
of
his
boots
,
out-heroding
*NL*
the
preposterous
fashion
of
the
time
,
turned
up
so
very
far
,
as
to
*NL*
be
attached
,
not
to
his
knees
merely
,
but
to
his
very
girdle
,
and
*NL*
effectually
prevented
him
from
putting
his
foot
into
the
stirrup
.
This
,
*NL*
however
,
was
a
slight
inconvenience
to
the
gallant
Abbot
,
who
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
even
rejoicing
in
the
opportunity
to
display
his
accomplished
*NL*
horsemanship
before
so
many
spectators
,
especially
of
the
fair
sex
,
*NL*
dispensed
with
the
use
of
these
supports
to
a
timid
rider
.
The
rest
*NL*
of
Prince
John
's
retinue
consisted
of
the
favourite
leaders
of
his
*NL*
mercenary
troops
,
some
marauding
barons
and
profligate
attendants
upon
*NL*
the
court
,
with
several
Knights
Templars
and
Knights
of
St
John
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
may
be
here
remarked
,
that
the
knights
of
these
two
orders
were
*NL*
accounted
hostile
to
King
Richard
,
having
adopted
the
side
of
Philip
*NL*
of
France
in
the
long
train
of
disputes
which
took
place
in
Palestine
*NL*
betwixt
that
monarch
and
the
lion-hearted
King
of
England
.
It
was
the
*NL*
well-known
consequence
of
this
discord
that
Richard
's
repeated
victories
*NL*
had
been
rendered
fruitless
,
his
romantic
attempts
to
besiege
Jerusalem
*NL*
disappointed
,
and
the
fruit
of
all
the
glory
which
he
had
acquired
had
*NL*
dwindled
into
an
uncertain
truce
with
the
Sultan
Saladin
.
With
the
same
*NL*
policy
which
had
dictated
the
conduct
of
their
brethren
in
the
Holy
*NL*
Land
,
the
Templars
and
Hospitallers
in
England
and
Normandy
attached
*NL*
themselves
to
the
faction
of
Prince
John
,
having
little
reason
to
desire
*NL*
the
return
of
Richard
to
England
,
or
the
succession
of
Arthur
,
his
*NL*
legitimate
heir
.
For
the
opposite
reason
,
Prince
John
hated
and
*NL*
contemned
the
few
Saxon
families
of
consequence
which
subsisted
in
*NL*
England
,
and
omitted
no
opportunity
of
mortifying
and
affronting
them
;
*NL*
being
conscious
that
his
person
and
pretensions
were
disliked
by
them
,
*NL*
as
well
as
by
the
greater
part
of
the
English
commons
,
who
feared
*NL*
farther
innovation
upon
their
rights
and
liberties
,
from
a
sovereign
of
*NL*
John
's
licentious
and
tyrannical
disposition
.
*NL*
*NL*
Attended
by
this
gallant
equipage
,
himself
well
mounted
,
and
splendidly
*NL*
dressed
in
crimson
and
in
gold
,
bearing
upon
his
hand
a
falcon
,
and
*NL*
having
his
head
covered
by
a
rich
fur
bonnet
,
adorned
with
a
circle
of
*NL*
precious
stones
,
from
which
his
long
curled
hair
escaped
and
overspread
*NL*
his
shoulders
,
Prince
John
,
upon
a
grey
and
high-mettled
palfrey
,
*NL*
caracoled
within
the
lists
at
the
head
of
his
jovial
party
,
laughing
*NL*
loud
with
his
train
,
and
eyeing
with
all
the
boldness
of
royal
criticism
*NL*
the
beauties
who
adorned
the
lofty
galleries
.
*NL*
*NL*
Those
who
remarked
in
the
physiognomy
of
the
Prince
a
dissolute
*NL*
audacity
,
mingled
with
extreme
haughtiness
and
indifference
to
the
*NL*
feelings
of
others
could
not
yet
deny
to
his
countenance
that
sort
of
*NL*
comeliness
which
belongs
to
an
open
set
of
features
,
well
formed
by
*NL*
nature
,
modelled
by
art
to
the
usual
rules
of
courtesy
,
yet
so
far
*NL*
frank
and
honest
,
that
they
seemed
as
if
they
disclaimed
to
conceal
the
*NL*
natural
workings
of
the
soul
.
Such
an
expression
is
often
mistaken
for
*NL*
manly
frankness
,
when
in
truth
it
arises
from
the
reckless
indifference
*NL*
of
a
libertine
disposition
,
conscious
of
superiority
of
birth
,
of
*NL*
wealth
,
or
of
some
other
adventitious
advantage
,
totally
unconnected
*NL*
with
personal
merit
.
To
those
who
did
not
think
so
deeply
,
and
they
were
*NL*
the
greater
number
by
a
hundred
to
one
,
the
splendour
of
Prince
John
's
*NL*
``
rheno
''
,
-LRB-
i.e.
fur
tippet
,
-RRB-
the
richness
of
his
cloak
,
lined
with
the
*NL*
most
costly
sables
,
his
maroquin
boots
and
golden
spurs
,
together
with
*NL*
the
grace
with
which
he
managed
his
palfrey
,
were
sufficient
to
merit
*NL*
clamorous
applause
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
his
joyous
caracole
round
the
lists
,
the
attention
of
the
Prince
*NL*
was
called
by
the
commotion
,
not
yet
subsided
,
which
had
attended
the
*NL*
ambitious
movement
of
Isaac
towards
the
higher
places
of
the
assembly
.
*NL*
The
quick
eye
of
Prince
John
instantly
recognised
the
Jew
,
but
was
*NL*
much
more
agreeably
attracted
by
the
beautiful
daughter
of
Zion
,
who
,
*NL*
terrified
by
the
tumult
,
clung
close
to
the
arm
of
her
aged
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
figure
of
Rebecca
might
indeed
have
compared
with
the
proudest
*NL*
beauties
of
England
,
even
though
it
had
been
judged
by
as
shrewd
a
*NL*
connoisseur
as
Prince
John
.
Her
form
was
exquisitely
symmetrical
,
*NL*
and
was
shown
to
advantage
by
a
sort
of
Eastern
dress
,
which
she
wore
*NL*
according
to
the
fashion
of
the
females
of
her
nation
.
Her
turban
*NL*
of
yellow
silk
suited
well
with
the
darkness
of
her
complexion
.
The
*NL*
brilliancy
of
her
eyes
,
the
superb
arch
of
her
eyebrows
,
her
well-formed
*NL*
aquiline
nose
,
her
teeth
as
white
as
pearl
,
and
the
profusion
of
her
*NL*
sable
tresses
,
which
,
each
arranged
in
its
own
little
spiral
of
twisted
*NL*
curls
,
fell
down
upon
as
much
of
a
lovely
neck
and
bosom
as
a
simarre
*NL*
of
the
richest
Persian
silk
,
exhibiting
flowers
in
their
natural
colours
*NL*
embossed
upon
a
purple
ground
,
permitted
to
be
visible
--
all
these
*NL*
constituted
a
combination
of
loveliness
,
which
yielded
not
to
the
most
*NL*
beautiful
of
the
maidens
who
surrounded
her
.
It
is
true
,
that
of
the
*NL*
golden
and
pearl-studded
clasps
,
which
closed
her
vest
from
the
throat
*NL*
to
the
waist
,
the
three
uppermost
were
left
unfastened
on
account
of
*NL*
the
heat
,
which
somewhat
enlarged
the
prospect
to
which
we
allude
.
A
*NL*
diamond
necklace
,
with
pendants
of
inestimable
value
,
were
by
this
means
*NL*
also
made
more
conspicuous
.
The
feather
of
an
ostrich
,
fastened
in
her
*NL*
turban
by
an
agraffe
set
with
brilliants
,
was
another
distinction
of
*NL*
the
beautiful
Jewess
,
scoffed
and
sneered
at
by
the
proud
dames
who
sat
*NL*
above
her
,
but
secretly
envied
by
those
who
affected
to
deride
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
bald
scalp
of
Abraham
,
''
said
Prince
John
,
``
yonder
Jewess
must
be
*NL*
the
very
model
of
that
perfection
,
whose
charms
drove
frantic
the
wisest
*NL*
king
that
ever
lived
!
What
sayest
thou
,
Prior
Aymer
?
--
By
the
Temple
*NL*
of
that
wise
king
,
which
our
wiser
brother
Richard
proved
unable
to
*NL*
recover
,
she
is
the
very
Bride
of
the
Canticles
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Rose
of
Sharon
and
the
Lily
of
the
Valley
,
''
--
answered
the
Prior
,
in
*NL*
a
sort
of
snuffling
tone
;
``
but
your
Grace
must
remember
she
is
still
but
*NL*
a
Jewess
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
!
''
added
Prince
John
,
without
heeding
him
,
``
and
there
is
my
Mammon
*NL*
of
unrighteousness
too
--
the
Marquis
of
Marks
,
the
Baron
of
Byzants
,
*NL*
contesting
for
place
with
penniless
dogs
,
whose
threadbare
cloaks
have
*NL*
not
a
single
cross
in
their
pouches
to
keep
the
devil
from
dancing
*NL*
there

By
the
body
of
St
Mark

prince

supplies

houri

thy
treasure-casket

*NL*
*NL*
``
My
daughter
Rebecca

answered
Isaac
,
with
a
*NL*
low
congee
,
nothing
embarrassed
by
the
Prince
's
salutation
,
in
which
,
*NL*
however
,
there
was
at
least
as
much
mockery
as
courtesy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
wiser
man
thou
,
''
said
John
,
with
a
peal
of
laughter
,
in
which
his
*NL*
gay
followers
obsequiously
joined
.
``
But
,
daughter
or
wife
,
she
should
*NL*
be
preferred
according
to
her
beauty
and
thy
merits
.
--
Who
sits
above
*NL*
there
?
''
he
continued
,
bending
his
eye
on
the
gallery
.
``
Saxon
churls
,
*NL*
lolling
at
their
lazy
length
!
--
out
upon
them
!
--
let
them
sit
close
,
and
*NL*
make
room
for
my
prince
of
usurers
and
his
lovely
daughter

I
'll
make
*NL*
the
hinds
know
they
must
share
the
high
places
of
the
synagogue
with
*NL*
those
whom
the
synagogue
properly
belongs

''
*NL*
*NL*
Those
who
occupied
the
gallery
to
whom
this
injurious
and
unpolite
*NL*
speech
was
addressed
,
were
the
family
of
Cedric
the
Saxon
,
with
that
of
*NL*
his
ally
and
kinsman
,
Athelstane
of
Coningsburgh
,
a
personage
,
who
,
on
*NL*
account
of
his
descent
from
the
last
Saxon
monarchs
of
England
,
was
held
*NL*
in
the
highest
respect
by
all
the
Saxon
natives
of
the
north
of
England
.
*NL*
But
with
the
blood
of
this
ancient
royal
race
,
many
of
their
infirmities
*NL*
had
descended
to
Athelstane
.
He
was
comely
in
countenance
,
bulky
*NL*
and
strong
in
person
,
and
in
the
flower
of
his
age
--
yet
inanimate
in
*NL*
expression
,
dull-eyed
,
heavy-browed
,
inactive
and
sluggish
in
all
his
*NL*
motions
,
and
so
slow
in
resolution
,
that
the
soubriquet
of
one
of
his
*NL*
ancestors
was
conferred
upon
him
,
and
he
was
very
generally
called
*NL*
Athelstane
the
Unready
.
His
friends
,
and
he
had
many
,
who
,
as
well
as
*NL*
Cedric
,
were
passionately
attached
to
him
,
contended
that
this
sluggish
*NL*
temper
arose
not
from
want
of
courage
,
but
from
mere
want
of
decision
;
*NL*
others
alleged
that
his
hereditary
vice
of
drunkenness
had
obscured
his
*NL*
faculties
,
never
of
a
very
acute
order
,
and
that
the
passive
courage
*NL*
and
meek
good-nature
which
remained
behind
,
were
merely
the
dregs
of
a
*NL*
character
that
might
have
been
deserving
of
praise
,
but
of
which
all
the
*NL*
valuable
parts
had
flown
off
in
the
progress
of
a
long
course
of
brutal
*NL*
debauchery
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
to
this
person
,
such
as
we
have
described
him
,
that
the
Prince
*NL*
addressed
his
imperious
command
to
make
place
for
Isaac
and
Rebecca
.
*NL*
Athelstane
,
utterly
confounded
at
an
order
which
the
manners
and
*NL*
feelings
of
the
times
rendered
so
injuriously
insulting
,
unwilling
to
*NL*
obey
,
yet
undetermined
how
to
resist
,
opposed
only
the
``
vis
inertiae
''
to
*NL*
the
will
of
John
;
and
,
without
stirring
or
making
any
motion
whatever
of
*NL*
obedience
,
opened
his
large
grey
eyes
,
and
stared
at
the
Prince
with
*NL*
an
astonishment
which
had
in
it
something
extremely
ludicrous
.
But
the
*NL*
impatient
John
regarded
it
in
no
such
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Saxon
porker
,
''
he
said
,
``
is
either
asleep
or
minds
me
not
--
Prick
*NL*
him
with
your
lance
,
De
Bracy
,
''
speaking
to
a
knight
who
rode
near
him
,
*NL*
the
leader
of
a
band
of
Free
Companions
,
or
Condottieri
;
that
is
,
of
*NL*
mercenaries
belonging
to
no
particular
nation
,
but
attached
for
the
time
*NL*
to
any
prince
by
whom
they
were
paid
.
There
was
a
murmur
even
among
the
*NL*
attendants
of
Prince
John
;
but
De
Bracy
,
whose
profession
freed
him
from
*NL*
all
scruples
,
extended
his
long
lance
over
the
space
which
separated
*NL*
the
gallery
from
the
lists
,
and
would
have
executed
the
commands
of
*NL*
the
Prince
before
Athelstane
the
Unready
had
recovered
presence
of
mind
*NL*
sufficient
even
to
draw
back
his
person
from
the
weapon
,
had
not
Cedric
,
*NL*
as
prompt
as
his
companion
was
tardy
,
unsheathed
,
with
the
speed
of
*NL*
lightning
,
the
short
sword
which
he
wore
,
and
at
a
single
blow
severed
*NL*
the
point
of
the
lance
from
the
handle
.
The
blood
rushed
into
the
*NL*
countenance
of
Prince
John
.
He
swore
one
of
his
deepest
oaths
,
and
*NL*
was
about
to
utter
some
threat
corresponding
in
violence
,
when
he
was
*NL*
diverted
from
his
purpose
,
partly
by
his
own
attendants
,
who
gathered
*NL*
around
him
conjuring
him
to
be
patient
,
partly
by
a
general
exclamation
*NL*
of
the
crowd
,
uttered
in
loud
applause
of
the
spirited
conduct
of
*NL*
Cedric
.
The
Prince
rolled
his
eyes
in
indignation
,
as
if
to
collect
some
*NL*
safe
and
easy
victim
;
and
chancing
to
encounter
the
firm
glance
of
the
*NL*
same
archer
whom
we
have
already
noticed
,
and
who
seemed
to
persist
*NL*
in
his
gesture
of
applause
,
in
spite
of
the
frowning
aspect
which
the
*NL*
Prince
bent
upon
him
,
he
demanded
his
reason
for
clamouring
thus
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
always
add
my
hollo
,
''
said
the
yeoman
,
``
when
I
see
a
good
shot
,
or
a
*NL*
gallant
blow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sayst
thou
?
''
answered
the
Prince
;
``
then
thou
canst
hit
the
white
*NL*
thyself
,
I
'll
warrant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
woodsman

mark
,
and
at
woodsman
's
distance
,
I
can
hit

''
answered
the
*NL*
yeoman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Wat
Tyrrel
's
mark
,
at
a
hundred
yards
,
''
said
a
voice
from
behind
,
*NL*
but
by
whom
uttered
could
not
be
discerned
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
allusion
to
the
fate
of
William
Rufus
,
his
Relative
,
at
once
*NL*
incensed
and
alarmed
Prince
John
.
He
satisfied
himself
,
however
,
with
*NL*
commanding
the
men-at-arms
,
who
surrounded
the
lists
,
to
keep
an
eye
on
*NL*
the
braggart
,
pointing
to
the
yeoman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

St
Grizzel

he
added
,
``

will
try

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
not
fly
the
trial

said
the
yeoman
,
with
the
composure
which
*NL*
marked
his
whole
deportment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Meanwhile
,
stand
up
,
ye
Saxon
churls
,
''
said
the
fiery
Prince
;
``
for
,
by
*NL*
the
light
of
Heaven
,
since
I
have
said
it
,
the
Jew
shall
have
his
seat
*NL*
amongst
ye
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
no
means
,
an

please
your
Grace
!
--
it
is
not
fit
for
such
as
we
*NL*
to
sit
with
the
rulers
of
the
land
,
''
said
the
Jew
;
whose
ambition
for
*NL*
precedence
though
it
had
led
him
to
dispute
Place
with
the
extenuated
*NL*
and
impoverished
descendant
of
the
line
of
Montdidier
,
by
no
means
*NL*
stimulated
him
to
an
intrusion
upon
the
privileges
of
the
wealthy
*NL*
Saxons
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Up
,
infidel
dog
when
I
command
you
,
''
said
Prince
John
,
``
or
I
will
have
*NL*
thy
swarthy
hide
stript
off
,
and
tanned
for
horse-furniture
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
urged
,
the
Jew
began
to
ascend
the
steep
and
narrow
steps
which
led
*NL*
up
to
the
gallery
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
see
,
''
said
the
Prince
,
``
who
dare
stop
him
,
''
fixing
his
eye
on
*NL*
Cedric
,
whose
attitude
intimated
his
intention
to
hurl
the
Jew
down
*NL*
headlong
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
catastrophe
was
prevented
by
the
clown
Wamba
,
who
,
springing
*NL*
betwixt
his
master
and
Isaac
,
and
exclaiming
,
in
answer
to
the
Prince
's
*NL*
defiance
,
``
Marry
,
that
will
I
!
''
opposed
to
the
beard
of
the
Jew
a
shield
*NL*
of
brawn
,
which
he
plucked
from
beneath
his
cloak
,
and
with
which
,
*NL*
doubtless
,
he
had
furnished
himself
,
lest
the
tournament
should
have
*NL*
proved
longer
than
his
appetite
could
endure
abstinence
.
Finding
the
*NL*
abomination
of
his
tribe
opposed
to
his
very
nose
,
while
the
Jester
,
*NL*
at
the
same
time
,
flourished
his
wooden
sword
above
his
head
,
the
Jew
*NL*
recoiled
,
missed
his
footing
,
and
rolled
down
the
steps
,
--
an
excellent
*NL*
jest
to
the
spectators
,
who
set
up
a
loud
laughter
,
in
which
Prince
John
*NL*
and
his
attendants
heartily
joined
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Deal
me
the
prize
,
cousin
Prince
,
''
said
Wamba
;
``
I
have
vanquished
my
*NL*
foe
in
fair
fight
with
sword
and
shield
,
''
he
added
,
brandishing
the
*NL*
brawn
in
one
hand
and
the
wooden
sword
in
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
,
and
what
art
thou
,
noble
champion
?

said
Prince
John
,
still
*NL*
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
fool
by
right
of
descent
,
''
answered
the
Jester
;
``
I
am
Wamba
,
the
*NL*
son
of
Witless

who
was
the
son
of

son
of
an
*NL*
Alderman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Make
room
for
the
Jew
in
front
of
the
lower
ring

''
said
Prince
John
,
*NL*
not
unwilling
perhaps
to
,
seize
an
apology
to
desist
from
his
original
*NL*
purpose
;
``
to
place
the
vanquished

the
victor

false
*NL*
heraldry

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Knave
upon
fool
were
worse

''
answered
the
Jester
,
``
and
Jew
upon
bacon
*NL*
worst
of
all

*NL*
*NL*
``
Gramercy
!
good
fellow

cried
Prince
John
,
``
thou
pleasest
me
--
Here
,
*NL*
Isaac
,
lend
me
a
handful
of
byzants

''
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
Jew
,
stunned
by
the
request
,
afraid
to
refuse
,
and
unwilling
*NL*
to
comply
,
fumbled
in
the
furred
bag
which
hung
by
his
girdle
,
and
*NL*
was
perhaps
endeavouring
to
ascertain
how
few
coins
might
pass
for
a
*NL*
handful
,
the
Prince
stooped
from
his
jennet
and
settled
Isaac
's
doubts
*NL*
by
snatching
the
pouch
itself
from
his
side
;
and
flinging
to
Wamba
a
*NL*
couple
of
the
gold
pieces
which
it
contained
,
he
pursued
his
career
*NL*
round
the
lists
,
leaving
the
Jew
to
the
derision
of
those
around
him
,
*NL*
and
himself
receiving
as
much
applause
from
the
spectators
as
if
he
had
*NL*
done
some
honest
and
honourable
action
.

CHAPTER
VIII
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
the
challenger
with
fierce
defy
*NL*
His
trumpet
sounds
;
the
challenged
makes
reply
:
*NL*
With
clangour
rings
the
field
,
resounds
the
vaulted
sky
.
*NL*
Their
visors
closed
,
their
lances
in
the
rest
,
*NL*
Or
at
the
helmet
pointed
or
the
crest
,
*NL*
They
vanish
from
the
barrier
,
speed
the
race
,
*NL*
And
spurring
see
decrease
the
middle
space
.
*NL*
Palamon
and
Arcite
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
midst
of
Prince
John
's
cavalcade
,
he
suddenly
stopt
,
and
*NL*
appealing
to
the
Prior
of
Jorvaulx
,
declared
the
principal
business
of
*NL*
the
day
had
been
forgotten
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
my
halidom
,
''
said
he
,
``
we
have
forgotten
,
Sir
Prior
,
to
name
the
*NL*
fair
Sovereign
of
Love
and
of
Beauty
,
by
whose
white
hand
the
palm
is
to
*NL*
be
distributed
.
For
my
part
,
I
am
liberal
in
my
ideas
,
and
I
care
not
if
*NL*
I
give
my
vote
for
the
black-eyed
Rebecca
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Holy
Virgin
,
''
answered
the
Prior
,
turning
up
his
eyes
in
horror
,
``
a
*NL*
Jewess
!
--
We
should
deserve
to
be
stoned
out
of
the
lists
;
and
I
am
not
*NL*
yet
old
enough
to
be
a
martyr
.
Besides
,
I
swear
by
my
patron
saint
,
that
*NL*
she
is
far
inferior
to
the
lovely
Saxon
,
Rowena
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Saxon
or
Jew
,
''
answered
the
Prince
,
``
Saxon
or
Jew
,
dog
or
hog
,
what
*NL*
matters
it
?
I
say
,
name
Rebecca
,
were
it
only
to
mortify
the
Saxon
*NL*
churls
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
murmur
arose
even
among
his
own
immediate
attendants
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
passes
a
jest
,
my
lord
,
''
said
De
Bracy
;
``
no
knight
here
will
lay
*NL*
lance
in
rest
if
such
an
insult
is
attempted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
the
mere
wantonness
of
insult
,
''
said
one
of
the
oldest
and
most
*NL*
important
of
Prince
John
's
followers
,
Waldemar
Fitzurse
,
``
and
if
your
*NL*
Grace
attempt
it
,
can
not
but
prove
ruinous
to
your
projects
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
entertained
you
,
sir
,
''
said
John
,
reining
up
his
palfrey
haughtily
,
*NL*
``
for
my
follower
,
but
not
for
my
counsellor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Those
who
follow
your
Grace
in
the
paths
which
you
tread
,
''
said
*NL*
Waldemar
,
but
speaking
in
a
low
voice
,
``
acquire
the
right
of
*NL*
counsellors
;
for
your
interest
and
safety
are
not
more
deeply
gaged
than
*NL*
their
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
tone
in
which
this
was
spoken
,
John
saw
the
necessity
of
*NL*
acquiescence
``
I
did
but
jest
,
''
he
said
;
``
and
you
turn
upon
me
like
*NL*
so
many
adders
!
Name
whom
you
will
,
in
the
fiend
's
name
,
and
please
*NL*
yourselves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
nay
,
''
said
De
Bracy
,
``
let
the
fair
sovereign
's
throne
remain
*NL*
unoccupied
,
until
the
conqueror
shall
be
named
,
and
then
let
him
choose
*NL*
the
lady
by
whom
it
shall
be
filled
.
It
will
add
another
grace
to
his
*NL*
triumph
,
and
teach
fair
ladies
to
prize
the
love
of
valiant
knights
,
who
*NL*
can
exalt
them
to
such
distinction
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
Brian
de
Bois-Guilbert
gain
the
prize
,
''
said
the
Prior
,
``
I
will
gage
*NL*
my
rosary
that
I
name
the
Sovereign
of
Love
and
Beauty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bois-Guilbert
,
''
answered
De
Bracy
,
``
is
a
good
lance
;
but
there
are
*NL*
others
around
these
lists
,
Sir
Prior
,
who
will
not
fear
to
encounter
*NL*
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Silence
,
sirs
,
''
said
Waldemar
,
``
and
let
the
Prince
assume
his
seat
.
*NL*
The
knights
and
spectators
are
alike
impatient
,
the
time
advances
,
and
*NL*
highly
fit
it
is
that
the
sports
should
commence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
John
,
though
not
yet
a
monarch
,
had
in
Waldemar
Fitzurse
all
the
*NL*
inconveniences
of
a
favourite
minister
,
who
,
in
serving
his
sovereign
,
*NL*
must
always
do
so
in
his
own
way
.
The
Prince
acquiesced
,
however
,
*NL*
although
his
disposition
was
precisely
of
that
kind
which
is
apt
to
be
*NL*
obstinate
upon
trifles
,
and
,
assuming
his
throne
,
and
being
surrounded
*NL*
by
his
followers
,
gave
signal
to
the
heralds
to
proclaim
the
laws
of
the
*NL*
tournament
,
which
were
briefly
as
follows
:
*NL*
*NL*
First
,
the
five
challengers
were
to
undertake
all
comers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Secondly
,
any
knight
proposing
to
combat
,
might
,
if
he
pleased
,
select
*NL*
a
special
antagonist
from
among
the
challengers
,
by
touching
his
shield
.
*NL*
If
he
did
so
with
the
reverse
of
his
lance
,
the
trial
of
skill
was
made
*NL*
with
what
were
called
the
arms
of
courtesy
,
that
is
,
with
lances
at
*NL*
whose
extremity
a
piece
of
round
flat
board
was
fixed
,
so
that
no
danger
*NL*
was
encountered
,
save
from
the
shock
of
the
horses
and
riders
.
But
if
*NL*
the
shield
was
touched
with
the
sharp
end
of
the
lance
,
the
combat
was
*NL*
understood
to
be
at
``
outrance
''
,
that
is
,
the
knights
were
to
fight
with
*NL*
sharp
weapons
,
as
in
actual
battle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thirdly
,
when
the
knights
present
had
accomplished
their
vow
,
by
each
of
*NL*
them
breaking
five
lances
,
the
Prince
was
to
declare
the
victor
in
the
*NL*
first
day
's
tourney
,
who
should
receive
as
prize
a
warhorse
of
exquisite
*NL*
beauty
and
matchless
strength
;
and
in
addition
to
this
reward
of
valour
,
*NL*
it
was
now
declared
,
he
should
have
the
peculiar
honour
of
naming
the
*NL*
Queen
of
Love
and
Beauty
,
by
whom
the
prize
should
be
given
on
the
*NL*
ensuing
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fourthly
,
it
was
announced
,
that
,
on
the
second
day
,
there
should
be
a
*NL*
general
tournament
,
in
which
all
the
knights
present
,
who
were
desirous
*NL*
to
win
praise
,
might
take
part
;
and
being
divided
into
two
bands
of
*NL*
equal
numbers
,
might
fight
it
out
manfully
,
until
the
signal
was
given
*NL*
by
Prince
John
to
cease
the
combat
.
The
elected
Queen
of
Love
and
Beauty
*NL*
was
then
to
crown
the
knight
whom
the
Prince
should
adjudge
to
have
*NL*
borne
himself
best
in
this
second
day
,
with
a
coronet
composed
of
thin
*NL*
gold
plate
,
cut
into
the
shape
of
a
laurel
crown
.
On
this
second
day
*NL*
the
knightly
games
ceased
.
But
on
that
which
was
to
follow
,
feats
of
*NL*
archery
,
of
bull-baiting
,
and
other
popular
amusements
,
were
to
be
*NL*
practised
,
for
the
more
immediate
amusement
of
the
populace
.
In
this
*NL*
manner
did
Prince
John
endeavour
to
lay
the
foundation
of
a
popularity
,
*NL*
which
he
was
perpetually
throwing
down
by
some
inconsiderate
act
of
*NL*
wanton
aggression
upon
the
feelings
and
prejudices
of
the
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lists
now
presented
a
most
splendid
spectacle
.
The
sloping
galleries
*NL*
were
crowded
with
all
that
was
noble
,
great
,
wealthy
,
and
beautiful
*NL*
in
the
northern
and
midland
parts
of
England
;
and
the
contrast
of
the
*NL*
various
dresses
of
these
dignified
spectators
,
rendered
the
view
as
*NL*
gay
as
it
was
rich
,
while
the
interior
and
lower
space
,
filled
with
the
*NL*
substantial
burgesses
and
yeomen
of
merry
England
,
formed
,
in
their
more
*NL*
plain
attire
,
a
dark
fringe
,
or
border
,
around
this
circle
of
brilliant
*NL*
embroidery
,
relieving
,
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
setting
off
its
splendour
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
heralds
finished
their
proclamation
with
their
usual
cry
of
*NL*
``
Largesse
,
largesse
,
gallant
knights
!
''
and
gold
and
silver
pieces
were
*NL*
showered
on
them
from
the
galleries
,
it
being
a
high
point
of
chivalry
*NL*
to
exhibit
liberality
towards
those
whom
the
age
accounted
at
once
the
*NL*
secretaries
and
the
historians
of
honour
.
The
bounty
of
the
spectators
*NL*
was
acknowledged
by
the
customary
shouts
of
``
Love
of
Ladies
--
Death
of
*NL*
Champions
--
Honour
to
the
Generous
--
Glory
to
the
Brave
!
''
To
which
the
*NL*
more
humble
spectators
added
their
acclamations
,
and
a
numerous
band
of
*NL*
trumpeters
the
flourish
of
their
martial
instruments
.
When
these
sounds
*NL*
had
ceased
,
the
heralds
withdrew
from
the
lists
in
gay
and
glittering
*NL*
procession
,
and
none
remained
within
them
save
the
marshals
of
the
*NL*
field
,
who
,
armed
cap-a-pie
,
sat
on
horseback
,
motionless
as
statues
,
*NL*
at
the
opposite
ends
of
the
lists
.
Meantime
,
the
enclosed
space
at
the
*NL*
northern
extremity
of
the
lists
,
large
as
it
was
,
was
now
completely
*NL*
crowded
with
knights
desirous
to
prove
their
skill
against
the
*NL*
challengers
,
and
,
when
viewed
from
the
galleries
,
presented
the
*NL*
appearance
of
a
sea
of
waving
plumage
,
intermixed
with
glistening
*NL*
helmets
,
and
tall
lances
,
to
the
extremities
of
which
were
,
in
many
*NL*
cases
,
attached
small
pennons
of
about
a
span
's
breadth
,
which
,
*NL*
fluttering
in
the
air
as
the
breeze
caught
them
,
joined
with
the
*NL*
restless
motion
of
the
feathers
to
add
liveliness
to
the
scene
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
the
barriers
were
opened
,
and
five
knights
,
chosen
by
lot
,
*NL*
advanced
slowly
into
the
area
;
a
single
champion
riding
in
front
,
and
*NL*
the
other
four
following
in
pairs
.
All
were
splendidly
armed
,
and
my
*NL*
Saxon
authority
-LRB-
in
the
Wardour
Manuscript
-RRB-
records
at
great
length
*NL*
their
devices
,
their
colours
,
and
the
embroidery
of
their
horse
*NL*
trappings
.
It
is
unnecessary
to
be
particular
on
these
subjects
.

from
a
contemporary
poet
,
who
has
written
but
too
little
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
knights
are
dust
,
*NL*
And
their
good
swords
are
rust
,
*NL*
Their
souls
are
with
the
saints
,
we
trust
.

*NL*
*NL*
Their
escutcheons
have
long
mouldered
from
the
walls
of
their
castles
.
*NL*
Their
castles
themselves
are
but
green
mounds
and
shattered
ruins
--
the
*NL*
place
that
once
knew
them
,
knows
them
no
more
--
nay
,
many
a
race
since
*NL*
theirs
has
died
out
and
been
forgotten
in
the
very
land
which
they
*NL*
occupied
,
with
all
the
authority
of
feudal
proprietors
and
feudal
*NL*
lords
.
What
,
then
,
would
it
avail
the
reader
to
know
their
names
,
or
the
*NL*
evanescent
symbols
of
their
martial
rank
!
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
however
,
no
whit
anticipating
the
oblivion
which
awaited
their
*NL*
names
and
feats
,
the
champions
advanced
through
the
lists
,
restraining
*NL*
their
fiery
steeds
,
and
compelling
them
to
move
slowly
,
while
,
at
the
*NL*
same
time
,
they
exhibited
their
paces
,
together
with
the
grace
and
*NL*
dexterity
of
the
riders
.
As
the
procession
entered
the
lists
,
the
*NL*
sound
of
a
wild
Barbaric
music
was
heard
from
behind
the
tents
of
the
*NL*
challengers
,
where
the
performers
were
concealed
.
It
was
of
Eastern
*NL*
origin
,
having
been
brought
from
the
Holy
Land
;
and
the
mixture
of
the
*NL*
cymbals
and
bells
seemed
to
bid
welcome
at
once
,
and
defiance
,
to
the
*NL*
knights
as
they
advanced
.
With
the
eyes
of
an
immense
concourse
of
*NL*
spectators
fixed
upon
them
,
the
five
knights
advanced
up
the
platform
*NL*
upon
which
the
tents
of
the
challengers
stood
,
and
there
separating
*NL*
themselves
,
each
touched
slightly
,
and
with
the
reverse
of
his
lance
,
*NL*
the
shield
of
the
antagonist
to
whom
he
wished
to
oppose
himself
.
The
*NL*
lower
orders
of
spectators
in
general
--
nay
,
many
of
the
higher
class
,
*NL*
and
it
is
even
said
several
of
the
ladies
,
were
rather
disappointed
*NL*
at
the
champions
choosing
the
arms
of
courtesy
.
For
the
same
sort
*NL*
of
persons
,
who
,
in
the
present
day
,
applaud
most
highly
the
deepest
*NL*
tragedies
,
were
then
interested
in
a
tournament
exactly
in
proportion
to
*NL*
the
danger
incurred
by
the
champions
engaged
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
intimated
their
more
pacific
purpose
,
the
champions
retreated
*NL*
to
the
extremity
of
the
lists
,
where
they
remained
drawn
up
in
a
line
;
*NL*
while
the
challengers
,
sallying
each
from
his
pavilion
,
mounted
their
*NL*
horses
,
and
,
headed
by
Brian
de
Bois-Guilbert
,
descended
from
the
*NL*
platform
,
and
opposed
themselves
individually
to
the
knights
who
had
*NL*
touched
their
respective
shields
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
flourish
of
clarions
and
trumpets
,
they
started
out
against
*NL*
each
other
at
full
gallop
;
and
such
was
the
superior
dexterity
or
*NL*
good
fortune
of
the
challengers
,
that
those
opposed
to
Bois-Guilbert
,
*NL*
Malvoisin
,
and
Front-de-Boeuf
,
rolled
on
the
ground
.
The
antagonist
of
*NL*
Grantmesnil
,
instead
of
bearing
his
lance-point
fair
against
the
crest
*NL*
or
the
shield
of
his
enemy
,
swerved
so
much
from
the
direct
line
as
*NL*
to
break
the
weapon
athwart
the
person
of
his
opponent
--
a
circumstance
*NL*
which
was
accounted
more
disgraceful
than
that
of
being
actually
*NL*
unhorsed
;
because
the
latter
might
happen
from
accident
,
whereas
the
*NL*
former
evinced
awkwardness
and
want
of
management
of
the
weapon
and
of
*NL*
the
horse
.
The
fifth
knight
alone
maintained
the
honour
of
his
party
,
*NL*
and
parted
fairly
with
the
Knight
of
St
John
,
both
splintering
their
*NL*
lances
without
advantage
on
either
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
shouts
of
the
multitude
,
together
with
the
acclamations
of
the
*NL*
heralds
,
and
the
clangour
of
the
trumpets
,
announced
the
triumph
of
the
*NL*
victors
and
the
defeat
of
the
vanquished
.
The
former
retreated
to
*NL*
their
pavilions
,
and
the
latter
,
gathering
themselves
up
as
they
could
,
*NL*
withdrew
from
the
lists
in
disgrace
and
dejection
,
to
agree
with
their
*NL*
victors
concerning
the
redemption
of
their
arms
and
their
horses
,
which
,
*NL*
according
to
the
laws
of
the
tournament
,
they
had
forfeited
.
The
fifth
*NL*
of
their
number
alone
tarried
in
the
lists
long
enough
to
be
greeted
*NL*
by
the
applauses
of
the
spectators
,
amongst
whom
he
retreated
,
to
the
*NL*
aggravation
,
doubtless
,
of
his
companions
'
mortification
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
second
and
a
third
party
of
knights
took
the
field
;
and
although
*NL*
they
had
various
success
,
yet
,
upon
the
whole
,
the
advantage
decidedly
*NL*
remained
with
the
challengers
,
not
one
of
whom
lost
his
seat
or
*NL*
swerved
from
his
charge
--
misfortunes
which
befell
one
or
two
of
their
*NL*
antagonists
in
each
encounter
.
The
spirits
,
therefore
,
of
those
opposed
*NL*
to
them
,
seemed
to
be
considerably
damped
by
their
continued
success
.
*NL*
Three
knights
only
appeared
on
the
fourth
entry
,
who
,
avoiding
the
*NL*
shields
of
Bois-Guilbert
and
Front-de-Boeuf
,
contented
themselves
*NL*
with
touching
those
of
the
three
other
knights
,
who
had
not
altogether
*NL*
manifested
the
same
strength
and
dexterity
.
This
politic
selection
*NL*
did
not
alter
the
fortune
of
the
field
,
the
challengers
were
still
*NL*
successful
:
one
of
their
antagonists
was
overthrown
,
and
both
the
others
*NL*
failed
in
the
``
attaint
''
,
-LSB-
18
-RSB-
that
is
,
in
striking
the
helmet
and
shield
*NL*
of
their
antagonist
firmly
and
strongly
,
with
the
lance
held
in
a
direct
*NL*
line
,
so
that
the
weapon
might
break
unless
the
champion
was
overthrown
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
fourth
encounter
,
there
was
a
considerable
pause
;
nor
did
*NL*
it
appear
that
any
one
was
very
desirous
of
renewing
the
contest
.
*NL*
The
spectators
murmured
among
themselves
;
for
,
among
the
challengers
,
*NL*
Malvoisin
and
Front-de-Boeuf
were
unpopular
from
their
characters
,
*NL*
and
the
others
,
except
Grantmesnil
,
were
disliked
as
strangers
and
*NL*
foreigners
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
none
shared
the
general
feeling
of
dissatisfaction
so
keenly
as
*NL*
Cedric
the
Saxon
,
who
saw
,
in
each
advantage
gained
by
the
Norman
*NL*
challengers
,
a
repeated
triumph
over
the
honour
of
England
.
His
own
*NL*
education
had
taught
him
no
skill
in
the
games
of
chivalry
,
although
,
*NL*
with
the
arms
of
his
Saxon
ancestors
,
he
had
manifested
himself
,
on
*NL*
many
occasions
,
a
brave
and
determined
soldier
.
He
looked
anxiously
*NL*
to
Athelstane
,
who
had
learned
the
accomplishments
of
the
age
,
as
if
*NL*
desiring
that
he
should
make
some
personal
effort
to
recover
the
victory
*NL*
which
was
passing
into
the
hands
of
the
Templar
and
his
associates
.
*NL*
But
,
though
both
stout
of
heart
,
and
strong
of
person
,
Athelstane
had
a
*NL*
disposition
too
inert
and
unambitious
to
make
the
exertions
which
Cedric
*NL*
seemed
to
expect
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
day
is
against
England
,
my
lord
,
''
said
Cedric
,
in
a
marked
tone
;
*NL*
``
are
you
not
tempted
to
take
the
lance
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
tilt
to-morrow
''
answered
Athelstane
,
``
in
the
`
melee
'
;
it
is
not
*NL*
worth
while
for
me
to
arm
myself
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Two
things
displeased
Cedric
in
this
speech
.
It
contained
the
Norman
*NL*
word
``
melee
''
,
-LRB-
to
express
the
general
conflict
,
-RRB-
and
it
evinced
*NL*
some
indifference
to
the
honour
of
the
country
;
but
it
was
spoken
by
*NL*
Athelstane
,
whom
he
held
in
such
profound
respect
,
that
he
would
not
*NL*
trust
himself
to
canvass
his
motives
or
his
foibles
.
Moreover
,
he
had
*NL*
no
time
to
make
any
remark
,
for
Wamba
thrust
in
his
word
,
observing
,
``
It
*NL*
was
better
,
though
scarce
easier
,
to
be
the
best
man
among
a
hundred
,
*NL*
than
the
best
man
of
two
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Athelstane
took
the
observation
as
a
serious
compliment
;
but
Cedric
,
*NL*
who
better
understood
the
Jester
's
meaning
,
darted
at
him
a
severe
and
*NL*
menacing
look
;
and
lucky
it
was
for
Wamba
,
perhaps
,
that
the
time
and
*NL*
place
prevented
his
receiving
,
notwithstanding
his
place
and
service
,
*NL*
more
sensible
marks
of
his
master
's
resentment
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
pause
in
the
tournament
was
still
uninterrupted
,
excepting
by
*NL*
the
voices
of
the
heralds
exclaiming
--
``
Love
of
ladies
,
splintering
of
*NL*
lances
!
stand
forth
gallant
knights
,
fair
eyes
look
upon
your
deeds
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
music
also
of
the
challengers
breathed
from
time
to
time
wild
bursts
*NL*
expressive
of
triumph
or
defiance
,
while
the
clowns
grudged
a
holiday
*NL*
which
seemed
to
pass
away
in
inactivity
;
and
old
knights
and
nobles
*NL*
lamented
in
whispers
the
decay
of
martial
spirit
,
spoke
of
the
triumphs
*NL*
of
their
younger
days
,
but
agreed
that
the
land
did
not
now
supply
dames
*NL*
of
such
transcendent
beauty
as
had
animated
the
jousts
of
former
times
.
*NL*
Prince
John
began
to
talk
to
his
attendants
about
making
ready
*NL*
the
banquet
,
and
the
necessity
of
adjudging
the
prize
to
Brian
de
*NL*
Bois-Guilbert
,
who
had
,
with
a
single
spear
,
overthrown
two
knights
,
and
*NL*
foiled
a
third
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
,
as
the
Saracenic
music
of
the
challengers
concluded
one
of
*NL*
those
long
and
high
flourishes
with
which
they
had
broken
the
silence
of
*NL*
the
lists
,
it
was
answered
by
a
solitary
trumpet
,
which
breathed
a
note
*NL*
of
defiance
from
the
northern
extremity
.
All
eyes
were
turned
to
see
*NL*
the
new
champion
which
these
sounds
announced
,
and
no
sooner
were
the
*NL*
barriers
opened
than
he
paced
into
the
lists
.
As
far
as
could
be
judged
*NL*
of
a
man
sheathed
in
armour
,
the
new
adventurer
did
not
greatly
exceed
*NL*
the
middle
size
,
and
seemed
to
be
rather
slender
than
strongly
made
.
*NL*
His
suit
of
armour
was
formed
of
steel
,
richly
inlaid
with
gold
,
and
the
*NL*
device
on
his
shield
was
a
young
oak-tree
pulled
up
by
the
roots
,
with
*NL*
the
Spanish
word
Desdichado
,
signifying
Disinherited
.
He
was
mounted
on
*NL*
a
gallant
black
horse
,
and
as
he
passed
through
the
lists
he
gracefully
*NL*
saluted
the
Prince
and
the
ladies
by
lowering
his
lance
.
The
dexterity
*NL*
with
which
he
managed
his
steed
,
and
something
of
youthful
grace
which
*NL*
he
displayed
in
his
manner
,
won
him
the
favour
of
the
multitude
,
which
*NL*
some
of
the
lower
classes
expressed
by
calling
out
,
``
Touch
Ralph
de
*NL*
Vipont
's
shield
--
touch
the
Hospitallers
shield
;
he
has
the
least
sure
*NL*
seat
,
he
is
your
cheapest
bargain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
champion
,
moving
onward
amid
these
well-meant
hints
,
ascended
the
*NL*
platform
by
the
sloping
alley
which
led
to
it
from
the
lists
,
and
,
*NL*
to
the
astonishment
of
all
present
,
riding
straight
up
to
the
central
*NL*
pavilion
,
struck
with
the
sharp
end
of
his
spear
the
shield
of
Brian
*NL*
de
Bois-Guilbert
until
it
rung
again
.
All
stood
astonished
at
his
*NL*
presumption
,
but
none
more
than
the
redoubted
Knight
whom
he
had
thus
*NL*
defied
to
mortal
combat
,
and
who
,
little
expecting
so
rude
a
challenge
,
*NL*
was
standing
carelessly
at
the
door
of
the
pavilion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
confessed
yourself
,
brother
,
''
said
the
Templar
,
``
and
have
you
*NL*
heard
mass
this
morning
,
that
you
peril
your
life
so
frankly
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
fitter
to
meet
death
than
thou
art
''
answered
the
Disinherited
*NL*
Knight
;
for
by
this
name
the
stranger
had
recorded
himself
in
the
books
*NL*
of
the
tourney
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
take
your
place
in
the
lists
,
''
said
Bois-Guilbert
,
``
and
look
your
*NL*
last
upon
the
sun
;
for
this
night
thou
shalt
sleep
in
paradise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gramercy
for
thy
courtesy
,
''
replied
the
Disinherited
Knight
,
``
and
to
*NL*
requite
it
,
I
advise
thee
to
take
a
fresh
horse
and
a
new
lance
,
for
by
*NL*
my
honour
you
will
need
both
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Having
expressed
himself
thus
confidently
,
he
reined
his
horse
backward
*NL*
down
the
slope
which
he
had
ascended
,
and
compelled
him
in
the
same
*NL*
manner
to
move
backward
through
the
lists
,
till
he
reached
the
*NL*
northern
extremity
,
where
he
remained
stationary
,
in
expectation
of
his
*NL*
antagonist
.
This
feat
of
horsemanship
again
attracted
the
applause
of
*NL*
the
multitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
incensed
at
his
adversary
for
the
precautions
which
he
*NL*
recommended
,
Brian
de
Bois-Guilbert
did
not
neglect
his
advice
;
for
*NL*
his
honour
was
too
nearly
concerned
,
to
permit
his
neglecting
any
means
*NL*
which
might
ensure
victory
over
his
presumptuous
opponent
.
He
changed
*NL*
his
horse
for
a
proved
and
fresh
one
of
great
strength
and
spirit
.
He
*NL*
chose
a
new
and
a
tough
spear
,
lest
the
wood
of
the
former
might
have
*NL*
been
strained
in
the
previous
encounters
he
had
sustained
.
Lastly
,
*NL*
he
laid
aside
his
shield
,
which
had
received
some
little
damage
,
and
*NL*
received
another
from
his
squires
.
His
first
had
only
borne
the
general
*NL*
device
of
his
rider
,
representing
two
knights
riding
upon
one
horse
,
an
*NL*
emblem
expressive
of
the
original
humility
and
poverty
of
the
Templars
,
*NL*
qualities
which
they
had
since
exchanged
for
the
arrogance
and
wealth
*NL*
that
finally
occasioned
their
suppression
.
Bois-Guilbert
's
new
shield
*NL*
bore
a
raven
in
full
flight
,
holding
in
its
claws
a
skull
,
and
bearing
*NL*
the
motto
,
``
Gare
le
Corbeau
''
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
two
champions
stood
opposed
to
each
other
at
the
two
*NL*
extremities
of
the
lists
,
the
public
expectation
was
strained
to
the
*NL*
highest
pitch
.
Few
augured
the
possibility
that
the
encounter
could
*NL*
terminate
well
for
the
Disinherited
Knight
,
yet
his
courage
and
*NL*
gallantry
secured
the
general
good
wishes
of
the
spectators
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
trumpets
had
no
sooner
given
the
signal
,
than
the
champions
vanished
*NL*
from
their
posts
with
the
speed
of
lightning
,
and
closed
in
the
centre
*NL*
of
the
lists
with
the
shock
of
a
thunderbolt
.
The
lances
burst
into
*NL*
shivers
up
to
the
very
grasp
,
and
it
seemed
at
the
moment
that
both
*NL*
knights
had
fallen
,
for
the
shock
had
made
each
horse
recoil
backwards
*NL*
upon
its
haunches
.
The
address
of
the
riders
recovered
their
steeds
*NL*
by
use
of
the
bridle
and
spur
;
and
having
glared
on
each
other
for
an
*NL*
instant
with
eyes
which
seemed
to
flash
fire
through
the
bars
of
their
*NL*
visors
,
each
made
a
demi-volte
,
and
,
retiring
to
the
extremity
of
the
*NL*
lists
,
received
a
fresh
lance
from
the
attendants
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
loud
shout
from
the
spectators
,
waving
of
scarfs
and
handkerchiefs
,
*NL*
and
general
acclamations
,
attested
the
interest
taken
by
the
spectators
*NL*
in
this
encounter
;
the
most
equal
,
as
well
as
the
best
performed
,
which
*NL*
had
graced
the
day
.
But
no
sooner
had
the
knights
resumed
their
station
,
*NL*
than
the
clamour
of
applause
was
hushed
into
a
silence
,
so
deep
and
so
*NL*
dead
,
that
it
seemed
the
multitude
were
afraid
even
to
breathe
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
minutes
pause
having
been
allowed
,
that
the
combatants
and
their
*NL*
horses
might
recover
breath
,
Prince
John
with
his
truncheon
signed
to
*NL*
the
trumpets
to
sound
the
onset
.
The
champions
a
second
time
sprung
from
*NL*
their
stations
,
and
closed
in
the
centre
of
the
lists
,
with
the
same
*NL*
speed
,
the
same
dexterity
,
the
same
violence
,
but
not
the
same
equal
*NL*
fortune
as
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
second
encounter
,
the
Templar
aimed
at
the
centre
of
his
*NL*
antagonist
's
shield
,
and
struck
it
so
fair
and
forcibly
,
that
his
spear
*NL*
went
to
shivers
,
and
the
Disinherited
Knight
reeled
in
his
saddle
.
*NL*
On
the
other
hand
,
that
champion
had
,
in
the
beginning
of
his
career
,
*NL*
directed
the
point
of
his
lance
towards
Bois-Guilbert
's
shield
,
but
,
*NL*
changing
his
aim
almost
in
the
moment
of
encounter
,
he
addressed
it
*NL*
to
the
helmet
,
a
mark
more
difficult
to
hit
,
but
which
,
if
attained
,
*NL*
rendered
the
shock
more
irresistible
.
Fair
and
true
he
hit
the
Norman
on
*NL*
the
visor
,
where
his
lance
's
point
kept
hold
of
the
bars
.
Yet
,
even
at
*NL*
this
disadvantage
,
the
Templar
sustained
his
high
reputation
;
and
had
*NL*
not
the
girths
of
his
saddle
burst
,
he
might
not
have
been
unhorsed
.
As
*NL*
it
chanced
,
however
,
saddle
,
horse
,
and
man
,
rolled
on
the
ground
under
*NL*
a
cloud
of
dust
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
extricate
himself
from
the
stirrups
and
fallen
steed
,
was
to
the
*NL*
Templar
scarce
the
work
of
a
moment
;
and
,
stung
with
madness
,
both
at
*NL*
his
disgrace
and
at
the
acclamations
with
which
it
was
hailed
by
the
*NL*
spectators
,
he
drew
his
sword
and
waved
it
in
defiance
of
his
conqueror
.
*NL*
The
Disinherited
Knight
sprung
from
his
steed
,
and
also
unsheathed
his
*NL*
sword
.
The
marshals
of
the
field
,
however
,
spurred
their
horses
between
*NL*
them
,
and
reminded
them
,
that
the
laws
of
the
tournament
did
not
,
on
the
*NL*
present
occasion
,
permit
this
species
of
encounter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
meet
again
,
I
trust
,
''
said
the
Templar
,
casting
a
resentful
*NL*
glance
at
his
antagonist
;
``
and
where
there
are
none
to
separate
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
we
do
not
,
''
said
the
Disinherited
Knight
,
``
the
fault
shall
not
be
*NL*
mine
.
On
foot
or
horseback
,
with
spear
,
with
axe
,
or
with
sword
,
I
am
*NL*
alike
ready
to
encounter
thee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
More
and
angrier
words
would
have
been
exchanged
,
but
the
marshals
,
*NL*
crossing
their
lances
betwixt
them
,
compelled
them
to
separate
.
The
*NL*
Disinherited
Knight
returned
to
his
first
station
,
and
Bois-Guilbert
*NL*
to
his
tent
,
where
he
remained
for
the
rest
of
the
day
in
an
agony
of
*NL*
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Without
alighting
from
his
horse
,
the
conqueror
called
for
a
bowl
of
*NL*
wine
,
and
opening
the
beaver
,
or
lower
part
of
his
helmet
,
announced
*NL*
that
he
quaffed
it
,
``
To
all
true
English
hearts
,
and
to
the
confusion
of
*NL*
foreign
tyrants
.
''
He
then
commanded
his
trumpet
to
sound
a
defiance
*NL*
to
the
challengers
,
and
desired
a
herald
to
announce
to
them
,
that
he
*NL*
should
make
no
election
,
but
was
willing
to
encounter
them
in
the
order
*NL*
in
which
they
pleased
to
advance
against
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gigantic
Front-de-Boeuf
,
armed
in
sable
armour
,
was
the
first
who
*NL*
took
the
field
.
He
bore
on
a
white
shield
a
black
bull
's
head
,
half
*NL*
defaced
by
the
numerous
encounters
which
he
had
undergone
,
and
bearing
*NL*
the
arrogant
motto
,
``
Cave
,
Adsum
''
.
Over
this
champion
the
Disinherited
*NL*
Knight
obtained
a
slight
but
decisive
advantage
.
Both
Knights
broke
*NL*
their
lances
fairly
,
but
Front-de-Boeuf
,
who
lost
a
stirrup
in
the
*NL*
encounter
,
was
adjudged
to
have
the
disadvantage
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
stranger
's
third
encounter
with
Sir
Philip
Malvoisin
,
he
was
*NL*
equally
successful
;
striking
that
baron
so
forcibly
on
the
casque
,
that
*NL*
the
laces
of
the
helmet
broke
,
and
Malvoisin
,
only
saved
from
falling
by
*NL*
being
unhelmeted
,
was
declared
vanquished
like
his
companions
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
his
fourth
combat
with
De
Grantmesnil
,
the
Disinherited
Knight
showed
*NL*
as
much
courtesy
as
he
had
hitherto
evinced
courage
and
dexterity
.
De
*NL*
Grantmesnil
's
horse
,
which
was
young
and
violent
,
reared
and
plunged
*NL*
in
the
course
of
the
career
so
as
to
disturb
the
rider
's
aim
,
and
the
*NL*
stranger
,
declining
to
take
the
advantage
which
this
accident
afforded
*NL*
him
,
raised
his
lance
,
and
passing
his
antagonist
without
touching
*NL*
him
,
wheeled
his
horse
and
rode
back
again
to
his
own
end
of
the
lists
,
*NL*
offering
his
antagonist
,
by
a
herald
,
the
chance
of
a
second
encounter
.
*NL*
This
De
Grantmesnil
declined
,
avowing
himself
vanquished
as
much
by
the
*NL*
courtesy
as
by
the
address
of
his
opponent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ralph
de
Vipont
summed
up
the
list
of
the
stranger
's
triumphs
,
being
*NL*
hurled
to
the
ground
with
such
force
,
that
the
blood
gushed
from
his
*NL*
nose
and
his
mouth
,
and
he
was
borne
senseless
from
the
lists
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
acclamations
of
thousands
applauded
the
unanimous
award
of
the
*NL*
Prince
and
marshals
,
announcing
that
day
's
honours
to
the
Disinherited
*NL*
Knight
.

CHAPTER
IX
*NL*
*NL*
--
In
the
midst
was
seen
*NL*
A
lady
of
a
more
majestic
mien
,
*NL*
By
stature
and
by
beauty
mark
'd
their
sovereign
Queen
.
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
And
as
in
beauty
she
surpass
'd
the
choir
,
*NL*
So
nobler
than
the
rest
was
her
attire
;
*NL*
A
crown
of
ruddy
gold
enclosed
her
brow
,
*NL*
Plain
without
pomp
,
and
rich
without
a
show
;
*NL*
A
branch
of
Agnus
Castus
in
her
hand
,
*NL*
She
bore
aloft
her
symbol
of
command
.
*NL*
The
Flower
and
the
Leaf
*NL*
*NL*
William
de
Wyvil
and
Stephen
de
Martival
,
the
marshals
of
the
field
,
*NL*
were
the
first
to
offer
their
congratulations
to
the
victor
,
praying
*NL*
him
,
at
the
same
time
,
to
suffer
his
helmet
to
be
unlaced
,
or
,
at
least
,
*NL*
that
he
would
raise
his
visor
ere
they
conducted
him
to
receive
*NL*
the
prize
of
the
day
's
tourney
from
the
hands
of
Prince
John
.
The
*NL*
Disinherited
Knight
,
with
all
knightly
courtesy
,
declined
their
request
,
*NL*
alleging
,
that
he
could
not
at
this
time
suffer
his
face
to
be
seen
,
for
*NL*
reasons
which
he
had
assigned
to
the
heralds
when
he
entered
the
lists
.
*NL*
The
marshals
were
perfectly
satisfied
by
this
reply
;
for
amidst
the
*NL*
frequent
and
capricious
vows
by
which
knights
were
accustomed
to
bind
*NL*
themselves
in
the
days
of
chivalry
,
there
were
none
more
common
than
*NL*
those
by
which
they
engaged
to
remain
incognito
for
a
certain
space
,
or
*NL*
until
some
particular
adventure
was
achieved
.
The
marshals
,
therefore
,
*NL*
pressed
no
farther
into
the
mystery
of
the
Disinherited
Knight
,
but
,
*NL*
announcing
to
Prince
John
the
conqueror
's
desire
to
remain
unknown
,
they
*NL*
requested
permission
to
bring
him
before
his
Grace
,
in
order
that
he
*NL*
might
receive
the
reward
of
his
valour
.
*NL*
*NL*
John
's
curiosity
was
excited
by
the
mystery
observed
by
the
stranger
;
*NL*
and
,
being
already
displeased
with
the
issue
of
the
tournament
,
in
which
*NL*
the
challengers
whom
he
favoured
had
been
successively
defeated
by
one
*NL*
knight
,
he
answered
haughtily
to
the
marshals
,
``
By
the
light
of
Our
*NL*
Lady
's
brow
,
this
same
knight
hath
been
disinherited
as
well
of
his
*NL*
courtesy
as
of
his
lands
,
since
he
desires
to
appear
before
us
without
*NL*
uncovering
his
face
.
--
Wot
ye
,
my
lords
,
''
he
said
,
turning
round
to
his
*NL*
train
,
``
who
this
gallant
can
be
,
that
bears
himself
thus
proudly
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
guess
,
''
answered
De
Bracy
,
``
nor
did
I
think
there
had
been
*NL*
within
the
four
seas
that
girth
Britain
a
champion
that
could
bear
down
*NL*
these
five
knights
in
one
day
's
jousting
.
By
my
faith
,
I
shall
never
*NL*
forget
the
force
with
which
he
shocked
De
Vipont
.
The
poor
Hospitaller
*NL*
was
hurled
from
his
saddle
like
a
stone
from
a
sling
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Boast
not
of
that
,
''
said
a
Knight
of
St
John
,
who
was
present
;
*NL*
``
your
Temple
champion
had
no
better
luck
.
I
saw
your
brave
lance
,
*NL*
Bois-Guilbert
,
roll
thrice
over
,
grasping
his
hands
full
of
sand
at
*NL*
every
turn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
De
Bracy
,
being
attached
to
the
Templars
,
would
have
replied
,
but
was
*NL*
prevented
by
Prince
John
.
``
Silence
,
sirs
!
''
he
said
;
``
what
unprofitable
*NL*
debate
have
we
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
victor
,
''
said
De
Wyvil
,
``
still
waits
the
pleasure
of
your
*NL*
highness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
our
pleasure
,
''
answered
John
,
``
that
he
do
so
wait
until
we
learn
*NL*
whether
there
is
not
some
one
who
can
at

guess
at
his
name
and
*NL*
quality
.
Should
he
remain
there
till
night-fall
,
he
has
had
work
enough
*NL*
to
keep
him
warm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
Grace
,
''
said
Waldemar
Fitzurse
,
``
will
do
less
than
due
honour
to
*NL*
the
victor
,
if
you
compel
him
to
wait
till
we
tell
your
highness
that
*NL*
which
we
can
not
know
;
at
least
I
can
form
no
guess
--
unless
he
be
one
of
*NL*
the
good
lances
who
accompanied
King
Richard
to
Palestine
,
and
who
are
*NL*
now
straggling
homeward
from
the
Holy
Land
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
may
be
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
,
''
said
De
Bracy
;
``
he
is
about
the
same
*NL*
pitch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
Thomas
de
Multon
,
the
Knight
of
Gilsland
,
rather
,
''
said
Fitzurse
;
*NL*
``
Salisbury
is
bigger
in
the
bones
.
''
A
whisper
arose
among
the
train
,
*NL*
but
by
whom
first
suggested
could
not
be
ascertained
.
``
It
might
be
the
*NL*
King
--
it
might
be
Richard
Coeur-de-Lion
himself
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Over
God
's
forbode
!
''
said
Prince
John
,
involuntarily
turning
at
the
*NL*
same
time
as
pale
as
death
,
and
shrinking
as
if
blighted
by
a
flash
of
*NL*
lightning
;
``
Waldemar
!
--
De
Bracy
!
brave
knights

remember

your

stand
truly
by
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
is
no
danger
impending
,
''
said
Waldemar
Fitzurse
;
``
are
you
so
*NL*
little
acquainted
with
the
gigantic
limbs
of
your
father
's
son
,
as
*NL*
to
think
they
can
be
held
within
the
circumference
of
yonder
suit
*NL*
of
armour
?
--
De
Wyvil
and
Martival
,
you
will
best
serve
the
Prince
by
*NL*
bringing
forward
the
victor
to
the
throne
,
and
ending
an
error
that
has
*NL*
conjured
all
the
blood
from
his
cheeks

--
Look
at
him
more
closely
,

he
*NL*
continued
,
``
your
highness
will
see
that
he
wants
three
inches
of
King
*NL*
Richard
's
height
,
and
twice
as
much
of
his
shoulder-breadth
.
The
very
*NL*
horse
he
backs
,
could
not
have
carried
the
ponderous
weight
of
King
*NL*
Richard
through
a
single
course

''
*NL*
*NL*
While
he
was
yet
speaking
,
the
marshals
brought
forward
the
Disinherited
*NL*
Knight
to
the
foot
of
a
wooden
flight
of
steps
,
which
formed
the
ascent
*NL*
from
the
lists
to
Prince
John
's
throne
.
Still
discomposed
with
the
idea
*NL*
that
his
brother
,
so
much
injured
,
and
to
whom
he
was
so
much
indebted
,
*NL*
had
suddenly
arrived
in
his
native
kingdom
,
even
the
distinctions
*NL*
pointed
out
by
Fitzurse
did
not
altogether
remove
the
Prince
's
*NL*
apprehensions
;
and
while
,
with
a
short
and
embarrassed
eulogy
upon
his
*NL*
valour
,
he
caused
to
be
delivered
to
him
the
war-horse
assigned
as
the
*NL*
prize
,
he
trembled
lest
from
the
barred
visor
of
the
mailed
form
before
*NL*
him
,
an
answer
might
be
returned
,
in
the
deep
and
awful
accents
of
*NL*
Richard
the
Lion-hearted
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
Disinherited
Knight
spoke
not
a
word
in
reply
to
the
compliment
*NL*
of
the
Prince
,
which
he
only
acknowledged
with
a
profound
obeisance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
horse
was
led
into
the
lists
by
two
grooms
richly
dressed
,
the
*NL*
animal
itself
being
fully
accoutred
with
the
richest
war-furniture
;
*NL*
which
,
however
,
scarcely
added
to
the
value
of
the
noble
creature
in
the
*NL*
eyes
of
those
who
were
judges
.
Laying
one
hand
upon
the
pommel
of
the
*NL*
saddle
,
the
Disinherited
Knight
vaulted
at
once
upon
the
back
of
the
*NL*
steed
without
making
use
of
the
stirrup
,
and
,
brandishing
aloft
his
*NL*
lance
,
rode
twice
around
the
lists
,
exhibiting
the
points
and
paces
of
*NL*
the
horse
with
the
skill
of
a
perfect
horseman
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
appearance
of
vanity
,
which
might
otherwise
have
been
attributed
to
*NL*
this
display
,
was
removed
by
the
propriety
shown
in
exhibiting
to
the
*NL*
best
advantage
the
princely
reward
with
which
he
had
been
just
honoured
,
*NL*
and
the
Knight
was
again
greeted
by
the
acclamations
of
all
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meanwhile
,
the
bustling
Prior
of
Jorvaulx
had
reminded
Prince
*NL*
John
,
in
a
whisper
,
that
the
victor
must
now
display
his
good
judgment
,
*NL*
instead
of
his
valour
,
by
selecting
from
among
the
beauties
who
graced
*NL*
the
galleries
a
lady
,
who
should
fill
the
throne
of
the
Queen
of
Beauty
*NL*
and
of
Love
,
and
deliver
the
prize
of
the
tourney
upon
the
ensuing
day
.
*NL*
The
Prince
accordingly
made
a
sign
with
his
truncheon
,
as
the
Knight
*NL*
passed
him
in
his
second
career
around
the
lists
.
The
Knight
turned
*NL*
towards
the
throne
,
and
,
sinking
his
lance
,
until
the
point
was
within
*NL*
a
foot
of
the
ground
,
remained
motionless
,
as
if
expecting
John
's
*NL*
commands
;
while
all
admired
the
sudden
dexterity
with
which
he
instantly
*NL*
reduced
his
fiery
steed
from
a
state
of
violent
emotion
and
high
*NL*
excitation
to
the
stillness
of
an
equestrian
statue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
Disinherited
Knight
,
''
said
Prince
John
,
``
since
that
is
the
only
*NL*
title
by
which
we
can
address
you
,
it
is
now
your
duty
,
as
well
as
*NL*
privilege
,
to
name
the
fair
lady
,
who
,
as
Queen
of
Honour
and
of
Love
,
*NL*
is
to
preside
over
next
day
's
festival
.
If
,
as
a
stranger
in
our
land
,
*NL*
you
should
require
the
aid
of
other
judgment
to
guide
your
own
,
we
*NL*
can
only
say
that
Alicia
,
the
daughter
of
our
gallant
knight
Waldemar
*NL*
Fitzurse
,
has
at
our
court
been
long
held
the
first
in
beauty
as
in
*NL*
place
.
Nevertheless
,
it
is
your
undoubted
prerogative
to
confer
on
whom
*NL*
you
please
this
crown
,
by
the
delivery
of
which
to
the
lady
of
*NL*
your
choice
,
the
election
of
to-morrow
's
Queen
will
be
formal
and
*NL*
complete
.
--
Raise
your
lance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Knight
obeyed
;
and
Prince
John
placed
upon
its
point
a
coronet
of
*NL*
green
satin
,
having
around
its
edge
a
circlet
of
gold
,
the
upper
edge
*NL*
of
which
was
relieved
by
arrow-points
and
hearts
placed
interchangeably
,
*NL*
like
the
strawberry
leaves
and
balls
upon
a
ducal
crown
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
broad
hint
which
he
dropped
respecting
the
daughter
of
Waldemar
*NL*
Fitzurse
,
John
had
more
than
one
motive
,
each
the
offspring
of
a
mind
,
*NL*
which
was
a
strange
mixture
of
carelessness
and
presumption
with
low
*NL*
artifice
and
cunning
.
He
wished
to
banish
from
the
minds
of
the
chivalry
*NL*
around
him
his
own
indecent
and
unacceptable
jest
respecting
the
Jewess
*NL*
Rebecca
;
he
was
desirous
of
conciliating
Alicia
's
father
Waldemar
,
*NL*
of
whom
he
stood
in
awe
,
and
who
had
more
than
once
shown
himself
*NL*
dissatisfied
during
the
course
of
the
day
's
proceedings
.
He
had
also
a
*NL*
wish
to
establish
himself
in
the
good
graces
of
the
lady
;
for
John
was
*NL*
at
least
as
licentious
in
his
pleasures
as
profligate
in
his
ambition
.
*NL*
But
besides
all
these
reasons
,
he
was
desirous
to
raise
up
against
*NL*
the
Disinherited
Knight
-LRB-
towards
whom
he
already
entertained
a
strong
*NL*
dislike
-RRB-
a
powerful
enemy
in
the
person
of
Waldemar
Fitzurse
,
who
was
*NL*
likely
,
he
thought
,
highly
to
resent
the
injury
done
to
his
daughter
,
in
*NL*
case
,
as
was
not
unlikely
,
the
victor
should
make
another
choice
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
indeed
it
proved
.
For
the
Disinherited
Knight
passed
the
gallery
*NL*
close
to
that
of
the
Prince
,
in
which
the
Lady
Alicia
was
seated
in
the
*NL*
full
pride
of
triumphant
beauty
,
and
,
pacing
forwards
as
slowly
as
he
*NL*
had
hitherto
rode
swiftly
around
the
lists
,
he
seemed
to
exercise
his
*NL*
right
of
examining
the
numerous
fair
faces
which
adorned
that
splendid
*NL*
circle
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
worth
while
to
see
the
different
conduct
of
the
beauties
who
*NL*
underwent
this
examination
,
during
the
time
it
was
proceeding
.
Some
*NL*
blushed
,
some
assumed
an
air
of
pride
and
dignity
,
some
looked
straight
*NL*
forward
,
and
essayed
to
seem
utterly
unconscious
of
what
was
going
on
,
*NL*
some
drew
back
in
alarm
,
which
was
perhaps
affected
,
some
endeavoured
to
*NL*
forbear
smiling
,
and
there
were
two
or
three
who
laughed
outright
.
There
*NL*
were
also
some
who
dropped
their
veils
over
their
charms
;
but
,
as
the
*NL*
Wardour
Manuscript
says
these
were
fair
ones
of
ten
years
standing
,
it
*NL*
may
be
supposed
that
,
having
had
their
full
share
of
such
vanities
,
they
*NL*
were
willing
to
withdraw
their
claim
,
in
order
to
give
a
fair
chance
to
*NL*
the
rising
beauties
of
the
age
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
the
champion
paused
beneath
the
balcony
in
which
the
Lady
*NL*
Rowena
was
placed
,
and
the
expectation
of
the
spectators
was
excited
to
*NL*
the
utmost
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
must
be
owned
,
that
if
an
interest
displayed
in
his
success
could
*NL*
have
bribed
the
Disinherited
Knight
,
the
part
of
the
lists
before
which
*NL*
he
paused
had
merited
his
predilection
.
Cedric
the
Saxon
,
overjoyed
at
*NL*
the
discomfiture
of
the
Templar
,
and
still
more
so
at
the
miscarriage
of
*NL*
his
two
malevolent
neighbours
,
Front-de-Boeuf
and
Malvoisin
,
had
,
with
*NL*
his
body
half
stretched
over
the
balcony
,
accompanied
the
victor
in
each
*NL*
course
,
not
with
his
eyes
only
,
but
with
his
whole
heart
and
soul
.
The
*NL*
Lady
Rowena
had
watched
the
progress
of
the
day
with
equal
attention
,
*NL*
though
without
openly
betraying
the
same
intense
interest
.
Even
the
*NL*
unmoved
Athelstane
had
shown
symptoms
of
shaking
off
his
apathy
,
when
,
*NL*
calling
for
a
huge
goblet
of
muscadine
,
he
quaffed
it
to
the
health
*NL*
of
the
Disinherited
Knight
.
Another
group
,
stationed
under
the
gallery
*NL*
occupied
by
the
Saxons
,
had
shown
no
less
interest
in
the
fate
of
the
*NL*
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
Abraham
!
''
said
Isaac
of
York
,
when
the
first
course
was
run
*NL*
betwixt
the
Templar
and
the
Disinherited
Knight
,
``
how
fiercely
that
*NL*
Gentile
rides
!
Ah
,
the
good
horse
that
was
brought
all
the
long
way
*NL*
from
Barbary
,
he
takes
no
more
care
of
him
than
if
he
were
a
wild
ass
's
*NL*
colt
--
and
the
noble
armour
,
that
was
worth
so
many
zecchins
to
Joseph
*NL*
Pareira
,
the
armourer
of
Milan
,
besides
seventy
in
the
hundred
of
*NL*
profits
,
he
cares
for
it
as
little
as
if
he
had
found
it
in
the
*NL*
highways
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
he
risks
his
own
person
and
limbs
,
father
,
''
said
Rebecca
,
``
in
doing
*NL*
such
a
dreadful
battle
,
he
can
scarce
be
expected
to
spare
his
horse
and
*NL*
armour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Child
!
''
replied
Isaac
,
somewhat
heated
,
``
thou
knowest
not
what
thou
*NL*
speakest
--
His
neck
and
limbs
are
his
own
,
but
his
horse
and
armour
*NL*
belong
to
--
Holy
Jacob
!
what
was
I
about
to
say
!
--
Nevertheless
,
it
is
*NL*
a
good
youth
--
See
,
Rebecca
!
see
,
he
is
again
about
to
go
up
to
battle
*NL*
against
the
Philistine
--
Pray
,
child
--
pray
for
the
safety
of
the
good
*NL*
youth
,
--
and
of
the
speedy
horse
,
and
the
rich
armour
.
--
God
of
my
*NL*
fathers
!
''
he
again
exclaimed
,
``
he
hath
conquered
,
and
the
uncircumcised
*NL*
Philistine
hath
fallen
before
his
lance
,
--
even
as
Og
the
King
of
*NL*
Bashan
,
and
Sihon
,
King
of
the
Amorites
,
fell
before
the
sword
of
our
*NL*
fathers
!
--
Surely
he
shall
take
their
gold
and
their
silver
,
and
their
*NL*
war-horses
,
and
their
armour
of
brass
and
of
steel
,
for
a
prey
and
for
a
*NL*
spoil
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
same
anxiety
did
the
worthy
Jew
display
during
every
course
that
was
*NL*
run
,
seldom
failing
to
hazard
a
hasty
calculation
concerning
the
value
*NL*
of
the
horse
and
armour
which
was
forfeited
to
the
champion
upon
each
*NL*
new
success
.
There
had
been
therefore
no
small
interest
taken
in
the
*NL*
success
of
the
Disinherited
Knight
,
by
those
who
occupied
the
part
of
*NL*
the
lists
before
which
he
now
paused
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
from
indecision
,
or
some
other
motive
of
hesitation
,
the
*NL*
champion
of
the
day
remained
stationary
for
more
than
a
minute
,
while
*NL*
the
eyes
of
the
silent
audience
were
riveted
upon
his
motions
;
and
then
,
*NL*
gradually
and
gracefully
sinking
the
point
of
his
lance
,
he
deposited
*NL*
the
coronet
which
it
supported
at
the
feet
of
the
fair
Rowena
.
The
*NL*
trumpets
instantly
sounded
,
while
the
heralds
proclaimed
the
Lady
Rowena
*NL*
the
Queen
of
Beauty
and
of
Love
for
the
ensuing
day
,
menacing
with
*NL*
suitable
penalties
those
who
should
be
disobedient
to
her
authority
.
*NL*
They
then
repeated
their
cry
of
Largesse
,
to
which
Cedric
,
in
the
height
*NL*
of
his
joy
,
replied
by
an
ample
donative
,
and
to
which
Athelstane
,
*NL*
though
less
promptly
,
added
one
equally
large
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
some
murmuring
among
the
damsels
of
Norman
descent
,
who
were
*NL*
as
much
unused
to
see
the
preference
given
to
a
Saxon
beauty
,
as
the
*NL*
Norman
nobles
were
to
sustain
defeat
in
the
games
of
chivalry
which
they
*NL*
themselves
had
introduced
.
But
these
sounds
of
disaffection
were
drowned
*NL*
by
the
popular
shout
of
``
Long
live
the
Lady
Rowena
,
the
chosen
and
*NL*
lawful
Queen
of
Love
and
of
Beauty
!
''
To
which
many
in
the
lower
area
*NL*
added
,
``
Long
live
the
Saxon
Princess
!
long
live
the
race
of
the
immortal
*NL*
Alfred
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
However
unacceptable
these
sounds
might
be
to
Prince
John
,
and
to
*NL*
those
around
him
,
he
saw
himself
nevertheless
obliged
to
confirm
the
*NL*
nomination
of
the
victor
,
and
accordingly
calling
to
horse
,
he
left
*NL*
his
throne
;
and
mounting
his
jennet
,
accompanied
by
his
train
,
he
again
*NL*
entered
the
lists
.
The
Prince
paused
a
moment
beneath
the
gallery
of
*NL*
the
Lady
Alicia
,
to
whom
he
paid
his
compliments
,
observing
,
at
the
same
*NL*
time
,
to
those
around
him
--
``
By
my
halidome
,
sirs
!
if
the
Knight
's
feats
*NL*
in
arms
have
shown
that
he
hath
limbs
and
sinews
,
his
choice
hath
no
*NL*
less
proved
that
his
eyes
are
none
of
the
clearest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
on
this
occasion
,
as
during
his
whole
life
,
John
's
misfortune
,
*NL*
not
perfectly
to
understand
the
characters
of
those
whom
he
wished
to
*NL*
conciliate
.
Waldemar
Fitzurse
was
rather
offended
than
pleased
at
the
*NL*
Prince
stating
thus
broadly
an
opinion
,
that
his
daughter
had
been
*NL*
slighted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
no
right
of
chivalry
,
''
he
said
,
``
more
precious
or
inalienable
*NL*
than
that
of
each
free
knight
to
choose
his
lady-love
by
his
own
*NL*
judgment
.
My
daughter
courts
distinction
from
no
one
;
and
in
her
own
*NL*
character
,
and
in
her
own
sphere
,
will
never
fail
to
receive
the
full
*NL*
proportion
of
that
which
is
her
due
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
John
replied
not
;
but
,
spurring
his
horse
,
as
if
to
give
vent
*NL*
to
his
vexation
,
he
made
the
animal
bound
forward
to
the
gallery
where
*NL*
Rowena
was
seated
,
with
the
crown
still
at
her
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Assume
,
''
he
said
,
``
fair
lady
,
the
mark
of
your
sovereignty
,
to
which
*NL*
none
vows
homage
more
sincerely
than
ourself

John
of
Anjou
;
and
if
*NL*
it
please
you
to-day
,
with
your
noble
sire
and
friends
,
to
grace
our
*NL*
banquet
in
the
Castle
of
Ashby
,
we
shall
learn
to
know
the
empress
to
*NL*
whose
service
we
devote
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rowena
remained
silent
,
and
Cedric
answered
for
her
in
his
native
Saxon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Lady
Rowena
,
''
he
said
,
``
possesses
not
the
language
in
which
to
*NL*
reply
to
your
courtesy
,
or
to
sustain
her
part
in
your
festival
.
I
also
,
*NL*
and
the
noble
Athelstane
of
Coningsburgh
,
speak
only
the
language
,
and
*NL*
practise
only
the
manners
,
of
our
fathers
.
We
therefore
decline
with
*NL*
thanks
your
Highness
's
courteous
invitation
to
the
banquet
.
To-morrow
,
*NL*
the
Lady
Rowena
will
take
upon
her
the
state
to
which
she
has
been
*NL*
called
by
the
free
election
of
the
victor
Knight
,
confirmed
by
the
*NL*
acclamations
of
the
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
he
lifted
the
coronet
,
and
placed
it
upon
Rowena
's
head
,
in
*NL*
token
of
her
acceptance
of
the
temporary
authority
assigned
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
says
he
?
''
said
Prince
John
,
affecting
not
to
understand
the
*NL*
Saxon
language
,
in
which
,
however
,
he
was
well
skilled
.
The
purport
of
*NL*
Cedric
's
speech
was
repeated
to
him
in
French
.
``
It
is
well
,
''
he
said
;
*NL*
``
to-morrow
we
will
ourself
conduct
this
mute
sovereign
to
her
seat
of
*NL*
dignity
.
--
You
,
at
least
,
Sir
Knight
,
''
he
added
,
turning
to
the
victor
,
*NL*
who
had
remained
near
the
gallery
,
``
will
this
day
share
our
banquet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Knight
,
speaking
for
the
first
time
,
in
a
low
and
hurried
voice
,
*NL*
excused
himself
by
pleading
fatigue
,
and
the
necessity
of
preparing
for
*NL*
to-morrow
's
encounter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
well
,
''
said
Prince
John
,
haughtily
;
``
although
unused
to
such
*NL*
refusals
,
we
will
endeavour
to
digest
our
banquet
as
we
may
,
though
*NL*
ungraced
by
the
most
successful
in
arms
,
and
his
elected
Queen
of
*NL*
Beauty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
he
prepared
to
leave
the
lists
with
his
glittering
train
,
and
*NL*
his
turning
his
steed
for
that
purpose
,
was
the
signal
for
the
breaking
*NL*
up
and
dispersion
of
the
spectators
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
,
with
the
vindictive
memory
proper
to
offended
pride
,
especially
*NL*
when
combined
with
conscious
want
of
desert
,
John
had
hardly
proceeded
*NL*
three
paces
,
ere
again
,
turning
around
,
he
fixed
an
eye
of
stern
*NL*
resentment
upon
the
yeoman
who
had
displeased
him
in
the
early
part
of
*NL*
the
day
,
and
issued
his
commands
to
the
men-at-arms
who
stood
near
--
``
On
*NL*
your
life
,
suffer
not
that
fellow
to
escape
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
yeoman
stood
the
angry
glance
of
the
Prince
with
the
same
unvaried
*NL*
steadiness
which
had
marked
his
former
deportment
,
saying
,
with
a
smile
,
*NL*
``
I
have
no
intention
to
leave
Ashby
until
the
day
after
to-morrow
--
I
*NL*
must
see
how
Staffordshire
and
Leicestershire
can
draw
their
bows
--
the
*NL*
forests
of
Needwood
and
Charnwood
must
rear
good
archers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
,
''
said
Prince
John
to
his
attendants
,
but
not
in
direct
reply
,
--
``
I
*NL*
will
see
how
he
can
draw
his
own
;
and
woe
betide
him
unless
his
skill
*NL*
should
prove
some
apology
for
his
insolence
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
full
time
,
''
said
De
Bracy
,
``
that
the
`
outrecuidance
'
-LSB-
19
-RSB-
of
*NL*
these
peasants
should
be
restrained
by
some
striking
example
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Waldemar
Fitzurse
,
who
probably
thought
his
patron
was
not
taking
the
*NL*
readiest
road
to
popularity
,
shrugged
up
his
shoulders
and
was
silent
.
*NL*
Prince
John
resumed
his
retreat
from
the
lists
,
and
the
dispersion
of
*NL*
the
multitude
became
general
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
various
routes
,
according
to
the
different
quarters
from
which
*NL*
they
came
,
and
in
groups
of
various
numbers
,
the
spectators
were
seen
*NL*
retiring
over
the
plain
.
By
far
the
most
numerous
part
streamed
towards
*NL*
the
town
of
Ashby
,
where
many
of
the
distinguished
persons
were
lodged
*NL*
in
the
castle
,
and
where
others
found
accommodation
in
the
town
itself
.
*NL*
Among
these
were
most
of
the
knights
who
had
already
appeared
in
the
*NL*
tournament
,
or
who
proposed
to
fight
there
the
ensuing
day
,
and
who
,
as
*NL*
they
rode
slowly
along
,
talking
over
the
events
of
the
day
,
were
greeted
*NL*
with
loud
shouts
by
the
populace
.
The
same
acclamations
were
bestowed
*NL*
upon
Prince
John
,
although
he
was
indebted
for
them
rather
to
the
*NL*
splendour
of
his
appearance
and
train
,
than
to
the
popularity
of
his
*NL*
character
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
more
sincere
and
more
general
,
as
well
as
a
better-merited
*NL*
acclamation
,
attended
the
victor
of
the
day
,
until
,
anxious
to
withdraw
*NL*
himself
from
popular
notice
,
he
accepted
the
accommodation
of
one
of
*NL*
those
pavilions
pitched
at
the
extremities
of
the
lists
,
the
use
of
*NL*
which
was
courteously
tendered
him
by
the
marshals
of
the
field
.
On
his
*NL*
retiring
to
his
tent
,
many
who
had
lingered
in
the
lists
,
to
look
upon
*NL*
and
form
conjectures
concerning
him
,
also
dispersed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
signs
and
sounds
of
a
tumultuous
concourse
of
men
lately
crowded
*NL*
together
in
one
place
,
and
agitated
by
the
same
passing
events
,
were
now
*NL*
exchanged
for
the
distant
hum
of
voices
of
different
groups
retreating
*NL*
in
all
directions
,
and
these
speedily
died
away
in
silence
.
No
other
*NL*
sounds
were
heard
save
the
voices
of
the
menials
who
stripped
the
*NL*
galleries
of
their
cushions
and
tapestry
,
in
order
to
put
them
in
safety
*NL*
for
the
night
,
and
wrangled
among
themselves
for
the
half-used
bottles
*NL*
of
wine
and
relics
of
the
refreshment
which
had
been
served
round
to
the
*NL*
spectators
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beyond
the
precincts
of
the
lists
more
than
one
forge
was
erected
;
and
*NL*
these
now
began
to
glimmer
through
the
twilight
,
announcing
the
toil
of
*NL*
the
armourers
,
which
was
to
continue
through
the
whole
night
,
in
order
*NL*
to
repair
or
alter
the
suits
of
armour
to
be
used
again
on
the
morrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
strong
guard
of
men-at-arms
,
renewed
at
intervals
,
from
two
hours
to
*NL*
two
hours
,
surrounded
the
lists
,
and
kept
watch
during
the
night
.

CHAPTER
X
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
,
like
the
sad
presaging
raven
,
that
tolls
*NL*
The
sick
man
's
passport
in
her
hollow
beak
,
*NL*
And
in
the
shadow
of
the
silent
night
*NL*
Doth
shake
contagion
from
her
sable
wings
;
*NL*
Vex
'd
and
tormented
,
runs
poor
Barrabas
,
*NL*
With
fatal
curses
towards
these
Christians
.
*NL*
--
Jew
of
Malta
*NL*
*NL*
The
Disinherited
Knight
had
no
sooner
reached
his
pavilion
,
than
squires
*NL*
and
pages
in
abundance
tendered
their
services
to
disarm
him
,
to
bring
*NL*
fresh
attire
,
and
to
offer
him
the
refreshment
of
the
bath
.
Their
zeal
*NL*
on
this
occasion
was
perhaps
sharpened
by
curiosity
,
since
every
one
*NL*
desired
to
know
who
the
knight
was
that
had
gained
so
many
laurels
,
yet
*NL*
had
refused
,
even
at
the
command
of
Prince
John
,
to
lift
his
visor
or
*NL*
to
name
his
name
.
But
their
officious
inquisitiveness
was
not
gratified
.
*NL*
The
Disinherited
Knight
refused
all
other
assistance
save
that
of
his
*NL*
own
squire
,
or
rather
yeoman
--
a
clownish-looking
man
,
who
,
wrapt
in
a
*NL*
cloak
of
dark-coloured
felt
,
and
having
his
head
and
face
half-buried
*NL*
in
a
Norman
bonnet
made
of
black
fur
,
seemed
to
affect
the
incognito
*NL*
as
much
as
his
master
.
All
others
being
excluded
from
the
tent
,
this
*NL*
attendant
relieved
his
master
from
the
more
burdensome
parts
of
his
*NL*
armour
,
and
placed
food
and
wine
before
him
,
which
the
exertions
of
the
*NL*
day
rendered
very
acceptable
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Knight
had
scarcely
finished
a
hasty
meal
,
ere
his
menial
announced
*NL*
to
him
that
five
men
,
each
leading
a
barbed
steed
,
desired
to
speak
with
*NL*
him
.
The
Disinherited
Knight
had
exchanged
his
armour
for
the
long
robe
*NL*
usually
worn
by
those
of
his
condition
,
which
,
being
furnished
with
a
*NL*
hood
,
concealed
the
features
,
when
such
was
the
pleasure
of
the
*NL*
wearer
,
almost
as
completely
as
the
visor
of
the
helmet
itself
,
but
the
*NL*
twilight
,
which
was
now
fast
darkening
,
would
of
itself
have
rendered
*NL*
a
disguise
unnecessary
,
unless
to
persons
to
whom
the
face
of
an
*NL*
individual
chanced
to
be
particularly
well
known
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Disinherited
Knight
,
therefore
,
stept
boldly
forth
to
the
front
of
*NL*
his
tent
,
and
found
in
attendance
the
squires
of
the
challengers
,
whom
*NL*
he
easily
knew
by
their
russet
and
black
dresses
,
each
of
whom
led
*NL*
his
master
's
charger
,
loaded
with
the
armour
in
which
he
had
that
day
*NL*
fought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
According
to
the
laws
of
chivalry
,
''
said
the
foremost
of
these
men
,
``
I
,
*NL*
Baldwin
de
Oyley
,
squire
to
the
redoubted
Knight
Brian
de
Bois-Guilbert
,
*NL*
make
offer
to
you
,
styling
yourself
,
for
the
present
,
the
Disinherited
*NL*
Knight
,
of
the
horse
and
armour
used
by
the
said
Brian
de
Bois-Guilbert
*NL*
in
this
day
's
Passage
of
Arms
,
leaving
it
with
your
nobleness
to
retain
*NL*
or
to
ransom
the
same
,
according
to
your
pleasure
;
for
such
is
the
law
*NL*
of
arms
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
squires
repeated
nearly
the
same
formula
,
and
then
stood
to
*NL*
await
the
decision
of
the
Disinherited
Knight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
you
four
,
sirs
,
''
replied
the
Knight
,
addressing
those
who
had
last
*NL*
spoken
,
``
and
to
your
honourable
and
valiant
masters
,
I
have
one
common
*NL*
reply
.
Commend
me
to
the
noble
knights
,
your
masters
,
and
say
,
I
should
*NL*
do
ill
to
deprive
them
of
steeds
and
arms
which
can
never
be
used
by
*NL*
braver
cavaliers
.
--
I
would
I
could
here
end
my
message
to
these
*NL*
gallant
knights
;
but
being
,
as
I
term
myself
,
in
truth
and
earnest
,
the
*NL*
Disinherited
,
I
must
be
thus
far
bound
to
your
masters
,
that
they
will
,
*NL*
of
their
courtesy
,
be
pleased
to
ransom
their
steeds
and
armour
,
since
*NL*
that
which
I
wear
I
can
hardly
term
mine
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
stand
commissioned
,
each
of
us
,
''
answered
the
squire
of
Reginald
*NL*
Front-de-Boeuf
,
``
to
offer
a
hundred
zecchins
in
ransom
of
these
horses
*NL*
and
suits
of
armour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
sufficient
,
''
said
the
Disinherited
Knight
.
``
Half
the
sum
*NL*
my
present
necessities
compel
me
to
accept
;
of
the
remaining
half
,
*NL*
distribute
one
moiety
among
yourselves
,
sir
squires
,
and
divide
the
*NL*
other
half
betwixt
the
heralds
and
the
pursuivants
,
and
minstrels
,
and
*NL*
attendants
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
squires
,
with
cap
in
hand
,
and
low
reverences
,
expressed
their
deep
*NL*
sense
of
a
courtesy
and
generosity
not
often
practised
,
at
least
upon
a
*NL*
scale
so
extensive
.
The
Disinherited
Knight
then
addressed
his
discourse
*NL*
to
Baldwin
,
the
squire
of
Brian
de
Bois-Guilbert
.
``
From
your
master
,
''
*NL*
said
he
,
``
I
will
accept
neither
arms
nor
ransom

Say
to
him
in
my
name

*NL*
that
our
strife
is
not
ended

no
,
not
till
we
have
fought
as
well
with
*NL*
swords
as
with
lances
--
as
well
on
foot
as
on
horseback
.
To
this
*NL*
mortal
quarrel
he
has
himself
defied
me
,
and
I
shall
not
forget
the
*NL*
challenge
.
--
Meantime
,
let
him
be
assured
,
that
I
hold
him
not
as
one
of
*NL*
his
companions

with
whom
I
can
with
pleasure
exchange
courtesies
;
but
*NL*
rather
as
one
with
whom
I
stand
upon
terms
of
mortal
defiance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
master
,
''
answered
Baldwin
,
``
knows
how
to
requite
scorn
with
scorn

blows
with
blows

Since
you

accept
from
him
any
share
of
the
ransom
at
which
you
have
*NL*
rated
the
arms
of
the
other
knights
,
I
must
leave
his
armour
and
his
*NL*
horse
here
,
being
well
assured
that
he
will
never
deign
to
mount
the
one
*NL*
nor
wear
the
other

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
spoken
well

said
the
Disinherited
Knight
,
*NL*
``
well

boldly

it
beseemeth
him

however

Restore
them

''
*NL*
*NL*
Baldwin
made
a
deep
obeisance
,
and
retired
with
his
companions
;
and
the
*NL*
Disinherited
Knight
entered
the
pavilion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thus
far

Gurth

said
he
,
addressing
his
attendant
,

Gurth

*NL*
``
Yea

the

continued
his
master
,
``

out
*NL*

Jew

York

let
him
pay
himself
for
the

with
which
his
credit
supplied
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay

St
Dunstan

''
replied
Gurth
,
``

I

*NL*
*NL*
``
How

''
replied
his
master
,
``
wilt
thou
not

my

*NL*
*NL*
``
So
they
be
honest
,
reasonable

and
Christian
commands

''
replied
Gurth
;
*NL*
``
but
this
is
none
of
these

To
suffer
the
Jew

would
be
*NL*
dishonest
,
for
it
would
be
cheating
my
master
;
and
unreasonable
,
for
it
*NL*
were
the
part
of
a
fool
;
and
unchristian
,
since
it
would
be
plundering
a
*NL*
believer
to
enrich
an
infidel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
him
contented
,
however
,
thou
stubborn
varlet
,
''
said
the
*NL*
Disinherited
Knight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
do
so
,
''
said
Gurth
,
taking
the
bag
under
his
cloak
,
and
leaving
*NL*
the
apartment
;
``
and
it
will
go
hard
,
''
he
muttered
,
``
but
I
content
him
*NL*
with
one-half
of
his
own
asking
.
''
So
saying
,
he
departed
,
and
left
the
*NL*
Disinherited
Knight
to
his
own
perplexed
ruminations
;
which
,
upon
more
*NL*
accounts
than
it
is
now
possible
to
communicate
to
the
reader
,
were
of
a
*NL*
nature
peculiarly
agitating
and
painful
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
must
now
change
the
scene
to
the
village
of
Ashby
,
or
rather
to
a
*NL*
country
house
in
its
vicinity
belonging
to
a
wealthy
Israelite
,
with
*NL*
whom
Isaac
,
his
daughter
,
and
retinue
,
had
taken
up
their
quarters
;
the
*NL*
Jews
,
it
is
well
known
,
being
as
liberal
in
exercising
the
duties
of
*NL*
hospitality
and
charity
among
their
own
people
,
as
they
were
alleged
to
*NL*
be
reluctant
and
churlish
in
extending
them
to
those
whom
they
*NL*
termed
Gentiles
,
and
whose
treatment
of
them
certainly
merited
little
*NL*
hospitality
at
their
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
an
apartment
,
small
indeed
,
but
richly
furnished
with
decorations
of
*NL*
an
Oriental
taste
,
Rebecca
was
seated
on
a
heap
of
embroidered
cushions
,
*NL*
which
,
piled
along
a
low
platform
that
surrounded
the
chamber
,
served
,
*NL*
like
the
estrada
of
the
Spaniards
,
instead
of
chairs
and
stools
.
She
*NL*
was
watching
the
motions
of
her
father
with
a
look
of
anxious
and
*NL*
filial
affection
,
while
he
paced
the
apartment
with
a
dejected
mien
*NL*
and
disordered
step
;
sometimes
clasping
his
hands
together
--
sometimes
*NL*
casting
his
eyes
to
the
roof
of
the
apartment
,
as
one
who
laboured
under
*NL*
great
mental
tribulation
.
``
O
,
Jacob
!
''
he
exclaimed
--
``
O
,
all
ye
twelve
*NL*
Holy
Fathers
of
our
tribe
!
what
a
losing
venture
is
this
for
one
who
*NL*
hath
duly
kept
every
jot
and
tittle
of
the
law
of
Moses
--
Fifty
zecchins
*NL*
wrenched
from
me
at
one
clutch
,
and
by
the
talons
of
a
tyrant
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
father
,
''
said
Rebecca
,
``
you
seemed
to
give
the
gold
to
Prince
John
*NL*
willingly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Willingly
?
the
blotch
of
Egypt
upon
him
!
--
Willingly
,
saidst
thou
?
--
Ay
,
*NL*
as
willingly
as
when
,
in
the
Gulf
of
Lyons
,
I
flung
over
my
merchandise
*NL*
to
lighten
the
ship
,
while
she
laboured
in
the
tempest
--
robed
the
*NL*
seething
billows
in
my
choice
silks
--
perfumed
their
briny
foam
with
*NL*
myrrh
and
aloes
--
enriched
their
caverns
with
gold
and
silver
work
!
And
*NL*
was
not
that
an
hour
of
unutterable
misery
,
though
my
own
hands
made
the
*NL*
sacrifice
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
was
a
sacrifice
which
Heaven
exacted
to
save
our
lives
,
''
*NL*
answered
Rebecca
,
``
and
the
God
of
our
fathers
has
since
blessed
your
*NL*
store
and
your
gettings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
''
answered
Isaac
,
``
but
if
the
tyrant
lays
hold
on
them
as
he
did
*NL*
to-day
,
and
compels
me
to
smile
while
he
is
robbing
me
?
--
O
,
daughter
,
*NL*
disinherited
and
wandering
as
we
are
,
the
worst
evil
which
befalls
our
*NL*
race
is
,
that
when
we
are
wronged
and
plundered
,
all
the
world
laughs
*NL*
around
,
and
we
are
compelled
to
suppress
our
sense
of
injury
,
and
to
*NL*
smile
tamely
,
when
we
would
revenge
bravely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Think
not
thus
of
it
,
my
father
,
''
said
Rebecca
;
``
we
also
have
*NL*
advantages
.
These
Gentiles
,
cruel
and
oppressive
as
they
are
,
are
in
*NL*
some
sort
dependent
on
the
dispersed
children
of
Zion
,
whom
they
despise
*NL*
and
persecute
.
Without
the
aid
of
our
wealth
,
they
could
neither
furnish
*NL*
forth
their
hosts
in
war
,
nor
their
triumphs
in
peace
,
and
the
gold
*NL*
which
we
lend
them
returns
with
increase
to
our
coffers
.
We
are
like
the
*NL*
herb
which
flourisheth
most
when
it
is
most
trampled
on
.
Even
this
day
's
*NL*
pageant
had
not
proceeded
without
the
consent
of
the
despised
Jew

who
*NL*
furnished
the

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Daughter

''
said
Isaac
,
``
thou
hast
harped
upon

the
full
profit

adventure
with
our
Kirjath
Jairam
of
Leicester
--
there
is
a
dead
loss

a
loss
which
swallows
up
the
gains
of
a
week
;
ay
,
of
the
space
*NL*
between
two
Sabbaths
--
and
yet
it
may
end
better
than
I
now
think
,
for
*NL*
't
is
a
good
youth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Assuredly
,
''
said
Rebecca
,
``
you
shall
not
repent
you
of
requiting
the
*NL*
good
deed
received
of
the
stranger
knight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
trust
so

said
Isaac
,
``
and
I
trust
too
in
the
rebuilding

of
Zion

as
well
do
I
hope
with
my
own
bodily
eyes
to
see
the
walls
*NL*
and
battlements
of
the
new
Temple
,
as
to
see
a
Christian
,
yea
,
the
very
*NL*
best
of
Christians
,
repay
a
debt
to
a
Jew
,
unless
under
the
awe
of
the
*NL*
judge
and
jailor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
he
resumed
his
discontented
walk
through
the
apartment
;
and
*NL*
Rebecca
,
perceiving
that
her
attempts
at
consolation
only
served
to
*NL*
awaken
new
subjects
of
complaint
,
wisely
desisted
from
her
unavailing
*NL*
efforts
--
a
prudential
line
of
conduct
,
and
we
recommend
to
all
who
set
*NL*
up
for
comforters
and
advisers
,
to
follow
it
in
the
like
circumstances
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
evening
was
now
becoming
dark
,
when
a
Jewish
servant
entered
the
*NL*
apartment
,
and
placed
upon
the
table
two
silver
lamps
,
fed
with
perfumed
*NL*
oil
;
the
richest
wines
,
and
the
most
delicate
refreshments
,
were
at
the
*NL*
same
time
displayed
by
another
Israelitish
domestic
on
a
small
ebony
*NL*
table
,
inlaid
with
silver
;
for
,
in
the
interior
of
their
houses
,
the
*NL*
Jews
refused
themselves
no
expensive
indulgences
.
At
the
same
time
the
*NL*
servant
informed
Isaac
,
that
a
Nazarene
-LRB-
so
they
termed
Christians
,
*NL*
while
conversing
among
themselves
-RRB-
desired
to
speak
with
him
.
He
that
*NL*
would
live
by
traffic
,
must
hold
himself
at
the
disposal
of
every
one
*NL*
claiming
business
with
him
.
Isaac
at
once
replaced
on
the
table
the
*NL*
untasted
glass
of
Greek
wine
which
he
had
just
raised
to
his
lips
,
and
*NL*
saying
hastily
to
his
daughter
,
``
Rebecca
,
veil
thyself
,
''
commanded
the
*NL*
stranger
to
be
admitted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
as
Rebecca
had
dropped
over
her
fine
features
a
screen
of
silver
*NL*
gauze
which
reached
to
her
feet
,
the
door
opened
,
and
Gurth
entered
,
*NL*
wrapt
in
the
ample
folds
of
his
Norman
mantle
.
His
appearance
was
rather
*NL*
suspicious
than
prepossessing
,
especially
as
,
instead
of
doffing
his
*NL*
bonnet
,
he
pulled
it
still
deeper
over
his
rugged
brow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Art
thou
Isaac
the
Jew
of
York
?
''
said
Gurth
,
in
Saxon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
,
''
replied
Isaac
,
in
the
same
language
,
-LRB-
for
his
traffic
had
*NL*
rendered
every
tongue
spoken
in
Britain
familiar
to
him
-RRB-
--
``
and
who
art
*NL*
thou
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
not
to
the
purpose
,
''
answered
Gurth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
much
as
my
name
is
to
thee
,
''
replied
Isaac
;
``
for
without
knowing
*NL*
thine
,
how
can
I
hold
intercourse
with
thee
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Easily
,
''
answered
Gurth
;
``
I
,
being
to
pay
money
,
must
know
that
I
*NL*
deliver
it
to
the
right
person
;
thou
,
who
are
to
receive
it
,
will
not
,
I
*NL*
think
,
care
very
greatly
by
whose
hands
it
is
delivered
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
''
said
the
Jew
,
``
you
are
come
to
pay
moneys
?
--
Holy
Father
Abraham
!
*NL*
that
altereth
our
relation
to
each
other

And
from
whom
dost
thou
bring
*NL*
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
the
Disinherited
Knight
,
''
said
Gurth
,
``
victor
in
this
day
's
*NL*
tournament

It
is
the
price
of
the
armour
supplied
to
him
by
Kirjath
*NL*
Jairam
of
Leicester
,
on
thy
recommendation
.
The
steed
is
restored
to
thy
*NL*
stable
.
I
desire
to
know
the
amount
of
the
sum
which
I
am
to
pay
for
the
*NL*
armour

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
said
he
was
a
good
youth

exclaimed
Isaac
with
joyful
exultation
.
``
A
*NL*
cup
of
wine
will
do
thee
no
harm

he
added
,
filling
and
handing
to
the
*NL*
swineherd
a
richer
drought
than
Gurth
had
ever
before
tasted
.
``
And
how
*NL*
much
money

continued
Isaac
,
``
has
thou
brought
with
thee

*NL*
*NL*
``

Virgin

said
Gurth
,
setting
down
the
cup
,
``

nectar
these
*NL*
unbelieving
dogs
drink

true
Christians
are
fain

thick
as

draff
we
give

What
money

I
*NL*
brought

continued
the
Saxon
,
when
he
had
finished
this
uncivil
*NL*
ejaculation
,
``
even

small
sum

something

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay

said
Isaac
,

*NL*
*NL*
``
My

disposed

Gurth

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

said
the
Jew
,

half

values

But
thou
hast
a

Isaac

prying
under
Gurth

cloak

``
it

heavy
one

*NL*

Gurth

readily

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

then

said
Isaac
,
panting
and
hesitating
between
habitual
love
*NL*
of
gain
and
a
new-born
desire
to
be
liberal
in
the
present
instance
,
``
if
*NL*
I
should
say
that
I
would
take
eighty
zecchins

armour

leaves
me
not
a

you
money
*NL*
to
pay
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Barely
,
''
said
Gurth
,
though
the
sum
demanded
was
more
reasonable
than
*NL*
he
expected
,
``
and
it
will
leave
my
master
nigh
penniless

Nevertheless

*NL*
if
such
be
your

I
must
be
content

*NL*
*NL*
``
Fill
thyself
another
goblet
of
wine

said
the
Jew
.
``
Ah
!
eighty
*NL*
zecchins

too
little

It
leaveth
no

good
horse
may
have
suffered

*NL*
*NL*
``

Gurth
,

I
say

over

hope

word
is
as
*NL*
good
as
a
Jew
's

will
not
take
seventy

I
will
carry
this
bag

*NL*
-LRB-
and
he
shook
it
till
the
contents
jingled
-RRB-
``
back
to
my
master

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
nay
!

said
Isaac
;
``
lay
down
the
talents

the
shekels

eighty

thou
shalt
see
I
will
consider
thee
liberally

''
*NL*
*NL*
Gurth
at
length
complied
;
and
telling
out
eighty
zecchins
upon
the
*NL*
table
,
the
Jew
delivered
out
to
him
an
acquittance
for
the
horse
and
*NL*
suit
of
armour
.
The
Jew
's
hand
trembled
for
joy
as
he
wrapped
up
the
*NL*
first
seventy
pieces
of
gold
.
The
last
ten
he
told
over
with
much
*NL*
deliberation
,
pausing
,
and
saying
something
as
he
took
each
piece
from
*NL*
the
table
,
and
dropt
it
into
his
purse
.
It
seemed
as
if
his
avarice
were
*NL*
struggling
with
his
better
nature
,
and
compelling
him
to
pouch
zecchin
*NL*
after
zecchin
while
his
generosity
urged
him
to
restore
some
part
at
*NL*
least
to
his
benefactor
,
or
as
a
donation
to
his
agent
.
His
whole
speech
*NL*
ran
nearly
thus
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Seventy-one
--
seventy-two
;
thy
master
is
a
good
youth
--
seventy-three
,
*NL*
an
excellent
youth
--
seventy-four
--
that
piece
hath
been
clipt
*NL*
within
the
ring
--
seventy-five
--
and
that
looketh
light
of
*NL*
weight
--
seventy-six
--
when
thy
master
wants
money
,
let
him
come
to
Isaac
*NL*
of
York
--
seventy-seven
--
that
is
,
with
reasonable
security
.
''
Here
he
made
*NL*
a
considerable
pause
,
and
Gurth
had
good
hope
that
the
last
three
pieces
*NL*
might
escape
the
fate
of
their
comrades
;
but
the
enumeration
*NL*
proceeded
.
--
``
Seventy-eight
--
thou
art
a
good
fellow
--
seventy-nine
--
and
*NL*
deservest
something
for
thyself
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
Jew
paused
again
,
and
looked
at
the
last
zecchin
,
intending
,
*NL*
doubtless
,
to
bestow
it
upon
Gurth
.
He
weighed
it
upon
the
tip
of
his
*NL*
finger
,
and
made
it
ring
by
dropping
it
upon
the
table
.
Had
it
rung
too
*NL*
flat
,
or
had
it
felt
a
hair
's
breadth
too
light
,
generosity
had
carried
*NL*
the
day
;
but
,
unhappily
for
Gurth
,
the
chime
was
full
and
true
,
the
*NL*
zecchin
plump
,
newly
coined
,
and
a
grain
above
weight
.
Isaac
could
not
*NL*
find
in
his
heart
to
part
with
it
,
so
dropt
it
into
his
purse
as
if
in
*NL*
absence
of
mind
,
with
the
words
,
``
Eighty
completes
the
tale
,
and
I
trust
*NL*
thy
master
will
reward
thee
handsomely
.
--
Surely
,
''
he
added
,
looking
*NL*
earnestly
at
the
bag
,
``
thou
hast
more
coins
in
that
pouch
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gurth
grinned
,
which
was
his
nearest
approach
to
a
laugh
,
as
he
replied
,
*NL*
``
About
the
same
quantity
which
thou
hast
just
told
over
so
carefully
.
''
*NL*
He
then
folded
the
quittance
,
and
put
it
under
his
cap
,
adding
,
--
``
Peril
*NL*
of
thy
beard
,
Jew
,
see
that
this
be
full
and
ample
!
''
He
filled
himself
*NL*
unbidden
,
a
third
goblet
of
wine
,
and
left
the
apartment
without
*NL*
ceremony
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rebecca
,
''
said
the
Jew
,
``
that
Ishmaelite
hath
gone
somewhat
beyond
me
.
*NL*
Nevertheless
his
master
is
a
good
youth
--
ay
,
and
I
am
well
pleased
that
*NL*
he
hath
gained
shekels
of
gold
and
shekels
of
silver
,
even
by
the
speed
*NL*
of
his
horse
and
by
the
strength
of
his
lance
,
which
,
like
that
of
*NL*
Goliath
the
Philistine
,
might
vie
with
a
weaver
's
beam
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
turned
to
receive
Rebecca
's
answer
,
he
observed
,
that
during
his
*NL*
chattering
with
Gurth
,
she
had
left
the
apartment
unperceived
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meanwhile
,
Gurth
had
descended
the
stair
,
and
,
having
reached
the
*NL*
dark
antechamber
or
hall
,
was
puzzling
about
to
discover
the
entrance
,
*NL*
when
a
figure
in
white
,
shown
by
a
small
silver
lamp
which
she
held
in
*NL*
her
hand
,
beckoned
him
into
a
side
apartment
.
Gurth
had
some
reluctance
*NL*
to
obey
the
summons
.
Rough
and
impetuous
as
a
wild
boar
,
where
only
*NL*
earthly
force
was
to
be
apprehended
,
he
had
all
the
characteristic
*NL*
terrors
of
a
Saxon
respecting
fawns
,
forest-fiends
,
white
women
,
and
*NL*
the
whole
of
the
superstitions
which
his
ancestors
had
brought
with
them
*NL*
from
the
wilds
of
Germany
.
He
remembered
,
moreover
,
that
he
was
in
the
*NL*
house
of
a
Jew
,
a
people
who
,
besides
the
other
unamiable
qualities
*NL*
which
popular
report
ascribed
to
them
,
were
supposed
to
be
profound
*NL*
necromancers
and
cabalists
.
Nevertheless
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
,
he
*NL*
obeyed
the
beckoning
summons
of
the
apparition
,
and
followed
her
into
*NL*
the
apartment
which
she
indicated
,
where
he
found
to
his
joyful
surprise
*NL*
that
his
fair
guide
was
the
beautiful
Jewess
whom
he
had
seen
at
the
*NL*
tournament
,
and
a
short
time
in
her
father
's
apartment
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
asked
him
the
particulars
of
his
transaction
with
Isaac
,
which
he
*NL*
detailed
accurately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
father
did
but
jest
with
thee
,
good
fellow
,
''
said
Rebecca
;
``
he
owes
*NL*
thy
master
deeper
kindness
than
these
arms
and
steed
could
pay
,
were
*NL*
their
value
tenfold
.
What
sum
didst
thou
pay
my
father
even
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eighty
zecchins
,
''
said
Gurth
,
surprised
at
the
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
this
purse
,
''
said
Rebecca
,
``
thou
wilt
find
a
hundred
.
Restore
to
*NL*
thy
master
that
which
is
his
due
,
and
enrich
thyself
with
the
remainder
.
*NL*
Haste
--
begone
--
stay
not
to
render
thanks
!
and
beware
how
you
pass
*NL*
through
this
crowded
town
,
where
thou
mayst
easily
lose
both
thy
burden
*NL*
and
thy
life
.

Reuben
,
''
she
added
,
clapping
her
hands
together
,
``
light
*NL*
forth
this
stranger
,
and
fail
not
to
draw
lock
and
bar
behind
him
.
''
*NL*
Reuben
,
a
dark-brow
'd
and
black-bearded
Israelite
,
obeyed
her
summons
,
*NL*
with
a
torch
in
his
hand
;
undid
the
outward
door
of
the
house
,
and
*NL*
conducting
Gurth
across
a
paved
court
,
let
him
out
through
a
wicket
in
*NL*
the
entrance-gate
,
which
he
closed
behind
him
with
such
bolts
and
chains
*NL*
as
would
well
have
become
that
of
a
prison
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
St
Dunstan
,
''
said
Gurth
,
as
he
stumbled
up
the
dark
avenue
,
``
this
*NL*
is
no
Jewess
,
but
an
angel
from
heaven
!
Ten
zecchins
from
my
brave
young

master

twenty
from
this
pearl
of
Zion

Oh

happy
day

Such
another

will
redeem
thy
bondage

and
make
thee
a
brother
as
free
of
thy
*NL*
guild
as
the
best

And
then
do
I
lay
down
my
swineherd

horn
and
staff
,
*NL*
and
take
the
freeman

sword

2d
Out
:
Peace
!
we
'll
hear
him
.
*NL*
3d
Out
:
Ay
,
by
my
beard
,
will
we
;
*NL*
For
he
's
a
proper
man
.
*NL*
--
Two
Gentlemen
of
Verona
*NL*
*NL*
The
nocturnal
adventures
of
Gurth
were
not
yet
concluded
;
indeed
he
*NL*
himself
became
partly
of
that
mind
,
when
,
after
passing
one
or
two
*NL*
straggling
houses
which
stood
in
the
outskirts
of
the
village
,
he
found
*NL*
himself
in
a
deep
lane
,
running
between
two
banks
overgrown
with
hazel
*NL*
and
holly
,
while
here
and
there
a
dwarf
oak
flung
its
arms
altogether
*NL*
across
the
path
.
The
lane
was
moreover
much
rutted
and
broken
up
by
the
*NL*
carriages
which
had
recently
transported
articles
of
various
kinds
to
*NL*
the
tournament
;
and
it
was
dark
,
for
the
banks
and
bushes
intercepted
*NL*
the
light
of
the
harvest
moon
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
village
were
heard
the
distant
sounds
of
revelry
,
mixed
*NL*
occasionally
with
loud
laughter
,
sometimes
broken
by
screams
,
and
*NL*
sometimes
by
wild
strains
of
distant
music
.
All
these
sounds
,
intimating
*NL*
the
disorderly
state
of
the
town
,
crowded
with
military
nobles
and
*NL*
their
dissolute
attendants
,
gave
Gurth
some
uneasiness
.
``
The
Jewess
was
*NL*
right
,
''
he
said
to
himself
.
``
By
heaven
and
St
Dunstan
,
I
would
I
were
*NL*
safe
at
my
journey
's
end
with
all
this
treasure
!
Here
are
such
numbers
,
*NL*
I
will
not
say
of
arrant
thieves
,
but
of
errant
knights
and
errant
*NL*
squires
,
errant
monks
and
errant
minstrels
,
errant
jugglers
and
errant
*NL*
jesters
,
that
a
man
with
a
single
merk
would
be
in
danger
,
much
more
a
*NL*
poor
swineherd
with
a
whole
bagful
of
zecchins
.
Would
I
were
out
of
*NL*
the
shade
of
these
infernal
bushes
,
that
I
might
at
least
see
any
of
St
*NL*
Nicholas
's
clerks
before
they
spring
on
my
shoulders
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gurth
accordingly
hastened
his
pace
,
in
order
to
gain
the
open
common
*NL*
to
which
the
lane
led
,
but
was
not
so
fortunate
as
to
accomplish
his
*NL*
object
.
Just
as
he
had
attained
the
upper
end
of
the
lane
,
where
the
*NL*
underwood
was
thickest
,
four
men
sprung
upon
him
,
even
as
his
fears
*NL*
anticipated
,
two
from
each
side
of
the
road
,
and
seized
him
so
fast
,
*NL*
that
resistance
,
if
at
first
practicable
,
would
have
been
now
too
*NL*
late
.
--
``
Surrender
your
charge
,
''
said
one
of
them
;
``
we
are
the
deliverers
*NL*
of
the
commonwealth
,
who
ease
every
man
of
his
burden
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
not
ease
me
of
mine
so
lightly
,
''
muttered
Gurth
,
whose
*NL*
surly
honesty
could
not
be
tamed
even
by
the
pressure
of
immediate
*NL*
violence
,
--
``
had
I
it
but
in
my
power
to
give
three
strokes
in
its
*NL*
defence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
see
that
presently
,
''
said
the
robber
;
and
,
speaking
to
his
*NL*
companions
,
he
added
,
``
bring
along
the
knave
.
I
see
he
would
have
his
*NL*
head
broken
,
as
well
as
his
purse
cut
,
and
so
be
let
blood
in
two
veins
*NL*
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gurth
was
hurried
along
agreeably
to
this
mandate
,
and
having
been
*NL*
dragged
somewhat
roughly
over
the
bank
,
on
the
left-hand
side
of
the
*NL*
lane
,
found
himself
in
a
straggling
thicket
,
which
lay
betwixt
it
and
*NL*
the
open
common
.
He
was
compelled
to
follow
his
rough
conductors
into
*NL*
the
very
depth
of
this
cover
,
where
they
stopt
unexpectedly
in
an
*NL*
irregular
open
space
,
free
in
a
great
measure
from
trees
,
and
on
which
,
*NL*
therefore
,
the
beams
of
the
moon
fell
without
much
interruption
from
*NL*
boughs
and
leaves
.
Here
his
captors
were
joined
by
two
other
persons
,
*NL*
apparently
belonging
to
the
gang
.
They
had
short
swords
by
their
sides
,
*NL*
and
quarter-staves
in
their
hands
,
and
Gurth
could
now
observe
that
*NL*
all
six
wore
visors
,
which
rendered
their
occupation
a
matter
of
no
*NL*
question
,
even
had
their
former
proceedings
left
it
in
doubt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
money
hast
thou
,
churl
?
''
said
one
of
the
thieves
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thirty
zecchins
of
my
own
property
,
''
answered
Gurth
,
doggedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
forfeit
--
a
forfeit
,
''
shouted
the
robbers
;
``
a
Saxon
hath
thirty
*NL*
zecchins
,
and
returns
sober
from
a
village
!
An
undeniable
and
*NL*
unredeemable
forfeit
of
all
he
hath
about
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hoarded
it
to
purchase
my
freedom
,
''
said
Gurth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
art
an
ass
,
''
replied
one
of
the
thieves
``
three
quarts
of
double
*NL*
ale
had
rendered
thee
as
free
as
thy
master
,
ay
,
and
freer
too
,
if
he
be
*NL*
a
Saxon
like
thyself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
sad
truth
,
''
replied
Gurth
;
``
but
if
these
same
thirty
zecchins
will
*NL*
buy
my
freedom
from
you
,
unloose
my
hands
,
and
I
will
pay
them
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
,
''
said
one
who
seemed
to
exercise
some
authority
over
the
others
;
*NL*
``
this
bag
which
thou
bearest
,
as
I
can
feel
through
thy
cloak
,
contains
*NL*
more
coin
than
thou
hast
told
us
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
the
good
knight
my
master
's
,
''
answered
Gurth
,
``
of
which
,
*NL*
assuredly
,
I
would
not
have
spoken
a
word
,
had
you
been
satisfied
with
*NL*
working
your
will
upon
mine
own
property
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
art
an
honest
fellow
,
''
replied
the
robber
,
``
I
warrant
thee
;
and
we
*NL*
worship
not
St
Nicholas
so
devoutly
but
what
thy
thirty
zecchins
may
yet
*NL*
escape
,
if
thou
deal
uprightly
with
us
.
Meantime
render
up
thy
trust
*NL*
for
a
time
.
''
So
saying
,
he
took
from
Gurth
's
breast
the
large
leathern
*NL*
pouch
,
in
which
the
purse
given
him
by
Rebecca
was
enclosed
,
as
well
as
*NL*
the
rest
of
the
zecchins
,
and
then
continued
his
interrogation
.
--
``
Who
is
*NL*
thy
master
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Disinherited
Knight
,
''
said
Gurth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whose
good
lance
,
''
replied
the
robber
,
``
won
the
prize
in
to-day
's
*NL*
tourney
?
What
is
his
name
and
lineage
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
his
pleasure
,
''
answered
Gurth
,
``
that
they
be
concealed
;
and
from
*NL*
me
,
assuredly
,
you
will
learn
nought
of
them

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
thine
own
name

lineage
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
tell
that
,
''
said
Gurth
,
``
might
reveal
my
master
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
art
a
saucy
groom
,
''
said
the
robber
,
``
but
of
that
anon

comes

this
gold

his
inheritance

by
what
means
hath
*NL*
it
accrued
to
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
his
good
lance
,
''
answered
Gurth
.
--
``
These
bags
contain
the
ransom
of
*NL*
four
good
horses
,
and
four
good
suits
of
armour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
is
there
?
''
demanded
the
robber
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Two
hundred
zecchins
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
two
hundred
zecchins
!
''
said
the
bandit
;
``
your
master
hath
dealt
*NL*
liberally
by
the
vanquished
,
and
put
them
to
a
cheap
ransom
.
Name
those
*NL*
who
paid
the
gold
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gurth
did
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
armour
and
horse
of
the
Templar
Brian
de
Bois-Guilbert
,
at
what
*NL*
ransom
were
they
held

Thou
seest
thou
canst
not
deceive
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
master
,
''
replied
Gurth
,
``
will
take
nought
from
the
Templar
save
*NL*
his
life
's

blood

They
are
on
terms
of
mortal
defiance
,
and
can
not
hold
*NL*
courteous
intercourse
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
!
''
--
repeated
the
robber
,
and
paused
after
he
had
said
the
*NL*
word
.
``
And
what
wert
thou
now
doing
at
Ashby
with
such
a
charge
in
thy
*NL*
custody

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
went
thither
to
render
to
Isaac
the
Jew
of
York

replied
Gurth
,
*NL*
``
the
price
of
a
suit
of
armour
with
which
he
fitted
my
master
for
this
*NL*
tournament
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
much
didst
thou
pay
to
Isaac
?
--
Methinks
,
to
judge
by
weight
,
*NL*
there
is
still
two
hundred
zecchins
in
this
pouch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
paid
to
Isaac
,
''
said
the
Saxon
,
``
eighty
zecchins
,
and
he
restored
me
*NL*
a
hundred
in
lieu
thereof
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
!
what
!
''
exclaimed
all
the
robbers
at
once
;
``
darest
thou
trifle
with
*NL*
us
,
that
thou
tellest
such
improbable
lies
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
I
tell
you
,
''
said
Gurth
,
``
is
as
true
as
the
moon
is
in
heaven

You
*NL*
will
find
the
just
sum
in
a
silken
purse
within
the
leathern
pouch
,
and
*NL*
separate
from
the
rest
of
the
gold
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bethink
thee
,
man
,
''
said
the
Captain
,
``
thou
speakest
of
a
Jew
--
of
an
*NL*
Israelite
,
--
as
unapt
to
restore
gold
,
as
the
dry
sand
of
his
deserts
to
*NL*
return
the
cup
of
water
which
the
pilgrim
spills
upon
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
more
mercy
in
them
,
''
said
another
of
the
banditti
,
``
than
in
*NL*
an
unbribed
sheriffs
officer

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
,
however
,
as
I
say
,
''
said
Gurth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Strike
a
light
instantly
,
''
said
the
Captain
;
``
I
will
examine
this
said
*NL*
purse
;
and
if
it
be
as
this
fellow
says
,
the
Jew
's
bounty
is
little
*NL*
less
miraculous
than
the
stream
which
relieved
his
fathers
in
the
*NL*
wilderness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
light
was
procured
accordingly
,
and
the
robber
proceeded
to
examine
*NL*
the
purse
.
The
others
crowded
around
him
,
and
even
two
who
had
hold
of
*NL*
Gurth
relaxed
their
grasp
while
they
stretched
their
necks
to
see
the
*NL*
issue
of
the
search
.
Availing
himself
of
their
negligence
,
by
a
sudden
*NL*
exertion
of
strength
and
activity
,
Gurth
shook
himself
free
of
their
*NL*
hold
,
and
might
have
escaped
,
could
he
have
resolved
to
leave
his
*NL*
master
's
property
behind
him
.
But
such
was
no
part
of
his
intention
.
*NL*
He
wrenched
a
quarter-staff
from
one
of
the
fellows
,
struck
down
the
*NL*
Captain
,
who
was
altogether
unaware
of
his
purpose
,
and
had
well-nigh
*NL*
repossessed
himself
of
the
pouch
and
treasure
.
The
thieves
,
however
,
*NL*
were
too
nimble
for
him
,
and
again
secured
both
the
bag
and
the
trusty
*NL*
Gurth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Knave
!
''
said
the
Captain
,
getting
up
,
``
thou
hast
broken
my
head
;
*NL*
and
with
other
men
of
our
sort
thou
wouldst
fare
the
worse
for
thy
*NL*
insolence
.
But
thou
shalt
know
thy
fate
instantly
.
First
let
us
speak
of
*NL*
thy
master
;
the
knight
's
matters
must
go
before
the
squire
's
,
according
*NL*
to
the
due
order
of
chivalry
.
Stand
thou
fast
in
the
meantime
--
if
*NL*
thou
stir
again
,
thou
shalt
have
that
will
make
thee
quiet
for
thy
*NL*
life
--
Comrades
!
''
he
then
said
,
addressing
his
gang
,
``
this
purse
is
*NL*
embroidered
with
Hebrew
characters
,
and
I
well
believe
the
yeoman
's
tale
*NL*
is
true
.
The
errant
knight
,
his
master
,
must
needs
pass
us
toll-free
.
He
*NL*
is
too
like
ourselves
for
us
to
make
booty
of
him
,
since
dogs
should
not
*NL*
worry
dogs
where
wolves
and
foxes
are
to
be
found
in
abundance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
us
?
''
answered
one
of
the
gang
;
``
I
should
like
to
hear
how
that
is
*NL*
made
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
thou
fool
,
''
answered
the
Captain
,
``
is
he
not
poor
and
disinherited
*NL*
as
we
are
?
--
Doth
he
not
win
his
substance
at
the
sword
's
point
as
we
*NL*
do
?
--
Hath
he
not
beaten
Front-de-Boeuf
and
Malvoisin
,
even
as
we
would
*NL*
beat
them
if
we
could
?
Is
he
not
the
enemy
to
life
and
death
of
Brian
*NL*
de
Bois-Guilbert
,
whom
we
have
so
much
reason
to
fear
?
And
were
all
*NL*
this
otherwise
,
wouldst
thou
have
us
show
a
worse
conscience
than
an
*NL*
unbeliever
,
a
Hebrew
Jew
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
that
were
a
shame
,
''
muttered
the
other
fellow
;
``
and
yet
,
when
I
*NL*
served
in
the
band
of
stout
old
Gandelyn
,
we
had
no
such
scruples
of
*NL*
conscience
.
And
this
insolent
peasant
,
--
he
too
,
I
warrant
me
,
is
to
be
*NL*
dismissed
scatheless
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
if
THOU
canst
scathe
him
,
''
replied
the
Captain
.
--
``
Here
,
fellow
,
''
*NL*
continued
he
,
addressing
Gurth
,
``
canst
thou
use
the
staff
,
that
thou
*NL*
starts
to
it
so
readily
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
,
''
said
Gurth
,
``
thou
shouldst
be
best
able
to
reply
to
that
*NL*
question
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
by
my
troth
,
thou
gavest
me
a
round
knock
,
''
replied
the
Captain
;
*NL*
``
do
as
much
for
this
fellow
,
and
thou
shalt
pass
scot-free
;
and
if
thou
*NL*
dost
not
--
why
,
by
my
faith
,
as
thou
art
such
a
sturdy
knave
,
I
think
*NL*
I
must
pay
thy
ransom
myself
.
--
Take
thy
staff
,
Miller
,
''
he
added
,
``
and
*NL*
keep
thy
head
;
and
do
you
others
let
the
fellow
go
,
and
give
him
a
*NL*
staff
--
there
is
light
enough
to
lay
on
load
by
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
champions
being
alike
armed
with
quarter-staves
,
stepped
forward
*NL*
into
the
centre
of
the
open
space
,
in
order
to
have
the
full
benefit
of
*NL*
the
moonlight
;
the
thieves
in
the
meantime
laughing
,
and
crying
to
their
*NL*
comrade
,
``
Miller
!
beware
thy
toll-dish
.
''
The
Miller
,
on
the
other
hand
,
*NL*
holding
his
quarter-staff
by
the
middle
,
and
making
it
flourish
round
*NL*
his
head
after
the
fashion
which
the
French
call
``
faire
le
moulinet
''
,
*NL*
exclaimed
boastfully
,
``
Come
on
,
churl
,
an
thou
darest
:
thou
shalt
feel
*NL*
the
strength
of
a
miller
's
thumb
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
thou
be
`
st
a
miller
,
''
answered
Gurth
,
undauntedly
,
making
his
weapon
*NL*
play
around
his
head
with
equal
dexterity
,
``
thou
art
doubly
a
thief
,
and
*NL*
I
,
as
a
true
man
,
bid
thee
defiance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
the
two
champions
closed
together
,
and
for
a
few
minutes
they
*NL*
displayed
great
equality
in
strength
,
courage
,
and
skill
,
intercepting
*NL*
and
returning
the
blows
of
their
adversary
with
the
most
rapid
*NL*
dexterity
,
while
,
from
the
continued
clatter
of
their
weapons
,
a
person
*NL*
at
a
distance
might
have
supposed
that
there
were
at
least
six
persons
*NL*
engaged
on
each
side
.
Less
obstinate
,
and
even
less
dangerous
combats
,
*NL*
have
been
described
in
good
heroic
verse
;
but
that
of
Gurth
and
the
*NL*
Miller
must
remain
unsung
,
for
want
of
a
sacred
poet
to
do
justice
to
*NL*
its
eventful
progress
.
Yet
,
though
quarter-staff
play
be
out
of
date
,
*NL*
what
we
can
in
prose
we
will
do
for
these
bold
champions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Long
they
fought
equally
,
until
the
Miller
began
to
lose
temper
at
*NL*
finding
himself
so
stoutly
opposed
,
and
at
hearing
the
laughter
of
his
*NL*
companions
,
who
,
as
usual
in
such
cases
,
enjoyed
his
vexation
.
This
was
*NL*
not
a
state
of
mind
favourable
to
the
noble
game
of
quarter-staff
,
in
*NL*
which
,
as
in
ordinary
cudgel-playing
,
the
utmost
coolness
is
requisite
;
*NL*
and
it
gave
Gurth
,
whose
temper
was
steady
,
though
surly
,
the
*NL*
opportunity
of
acquiring
a
decided
advantage
,
in
availing
himself
of
*NL*
which
he
displayed
great
mastery
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Miller
pressed
furiously
forward
,
dealing
blows
with
either
end
of
*NL*
his
weapon
alternately
,
and
striving
to
come
to
half-staff
distance
,
*NL*
while
Gurth
defended
himself
against
the
attack
,
keeping
his
hands
about
*NL*
a
yard
asunder
,
and
covering
himself
by
shifting
his
weapon
with
great
*NL*
celerity
,
so
as
to
protect
his
head
and
body
.
Thus
did
he
maintain
*NL*
the
defensive
,
making
his
eye
,
foot
,
and
hand
keep
true
time
,
until
,
*NL*
observing
his
antagonist
to
lose
wind
,
he
darted
the
staff
at
his
face
*NL*
with
his
left
hand
;
and
,
as
the
Miller
endeavoured
to
parry
the
thrust
,
*NL*
he
slid
his
right
hand
down
to
his
left
,
and
with
the
full
swing
of
the
*NL*
weapon
struck
his
opponent
on
the
left
side
of
the
head
,
who
instantly
*NL*
measured
his
length
upon
the
green
sward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
and
yeomanly
done
!
''
shouted
the
robbers
;
``
fair
play
and
Old
*NL*
England
for
ever
!
The
Saxon
hath
saved
both
his
purse
and
his
hide
,
and
*NL*
the
Miller
has
met
his
match
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
mayst
go
thy
ways
,
my
friend
,
''
said
the
Captain
,
addressing
Gurth
,
*NL*
in
special
confirmation
of
the
general
voice
,
``
and
I
will
cause
two
of
*NL*
my
comrades
to
guide
thee
by
the
best
way
to
thy
master
's
pavilion
,
and
*NL*
to
guard
thee
from
night-walkers
that
might
have
less
tender
consciences
*NL*
than
ours
;
for
there
is
many
one
of
them
upon
the
amble
in
such
a
night
*NL*
as
this
.
Take
heed
,
however
,
''
he
added
sternly
;
``
remember
thou
hast
*NL*
refused
to
tell
thy
name
--
ask
not
after
ours
,
nor
endeavour
to
discover
*NL*
who
or
what
we
are
;
for
,
if
thou
makest
such
an
attempt
,
thou
wilt
come
*NL*
by
worse
fortune
than
has
yet
befallen
thee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gurth
thanked
the
Captain
for
his
courtesy
,
and
promised
to
attend
to
*NL*
his
recommendation
.
Two
of
the
outlaws
,
taking
up
their
quarter-staves
,
*NL*
and
desiring
Gurth
to
follow
close
in
the
rear
,
walked
roundly
forward
*NL*
along
a
by-path
,
which
traversed
the
thicket
and
the
broken
ground
*NL*
adjacent
to
it
.
On
the
very
verge
of
the
thicket
two
men
spoke
to
his
*NL*
conductors
,
and
receiving
an
answer
in
a
whisper
,
withdrew
into
the
*NL*
wood
,
and
suffered
them
to
pass
unmolested
.
This
circumstance
induced
*NL*
Gurth
to
believe
both
that
the
gang
was
strong
in
numbers
,
and
that
they
*NL*
kept
regular
guards
around
their
place
of
rendezvous
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
arrived
on
the
open
heath
,
where
Gurth
might
have
had
some
*NL*
trouble
in
finding
his
road
,
the
thieves
guided
him
straight
forward
to
*NL*
the
top
of
a
little
eminence
,
whence
he
could
see
,
spread
beneath
him
*NL*
in
the
moonlight
,
the
palisades
of
the
lists
,
the
glimmering
pavilions
*NL*
pitched
at
either
end
,
with
the
pennons
which
adorned
them
fluttering
*NL*
in
the
moonbeams
,
and
from
which
could
be
heard
the
hum
of
the
song
with
*NL*
which
the
sentinels
were
beguiling
their
night-watch
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
thieves
stopt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
go
with
you
no
farther
,
''
said
they
;
``
it
were
not
safe
that
we
should
*NL*
do
so
.
--
Remember
the
warning
you
have
received
--
keep
secret
what
has
*NL*
this
night
befallen
you
,
and
you
will
have
no
room
to
repent
it
--
neglect
*NL*
what
is
now
told
you
,
and
the
Tower
of
London
shall
not
protect
you
*NL*
against
our
revenge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
night
to
you
,
kind
sirs
,
''
said
Gurth
;
``
I
shall
remember
your
*NL*
orders
,
and
trust
that
there
is
no
offence
in
wishing
you
a
safer
and
an
*NL*
honester
trade
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
they
parted
,
the
outlaws
returning
in
the
direction
from
whence
*NL*
they
had
come
,
and
Gurth
proceeding
to
the
tent
of
his
master
,
to
whom
,
*NL*
notwithstanding
the
injunction
he
had
received
,
he
communicated
the
*NL*
whole
adventures
of
the
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Disinherited
Knight
was
filled
with
astonishment
,
no
less
at
the
*NL*
generosity
of
Rebecca
,
by
which
,
however
,
he
resolved
he
would
not
*NL*
profit
,
than
that
of
the
robbers
,
to
whose
profession
such
a
quality
*NL*
seemed
totally
foreign
.
His
course
of
reflections
upon
these
singular
*NL*
circumstances
was
,
however
,
interrupted
by
the
necessity
for
taking
*NL*
repose
,
which
the
fatigue
of
the
preceding
day
,
and
the
propriety
*NL*
of
refreshing
himself
for
the
morrow
's
encounter
,
rendered
alike
*NL*
indispensable
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
knight
,
therefore
,
stretched
himself
for
repose
upon
a
rich
couch
*NL*
with
which
the
tent
was
provided
;
and
the
faithful
Gurth
,
extending
*NL*
his
hardy
limbs
upon
a
bear-skin
which
formed
a
sort
of
carpet
to
the
*NL*
pavilion
,
laid
himself
across
the
opening
of
the
tent
,
so
that
no
one
*NL*
could
enter
without
awakening
him
.

CHAPTER
XII
*NL*
*NL*
The
heralds
left
their
pricking
up
and
down
,
*NL*
Now
ringen
trumpets
loud
and
clarion
.
*NL*
There
is
no
more
to
say
,
but
east
and
west
,
*NL*
In
go
the
speares
sadly
in
the
rest
,
*NL*
In
goth
the
sharp
spur
into
the
side
,
*NL*
There
see
men
who
can
just
and
who
can
ride
;
*NL*
There
shiver
shaftes
upon
shieldes
thick
,
*NL*
He
feeleth
through
the
heart-spone
the
prick
;
*NL*
Up
springen
speares
,
twenty
feet
in
height
,
*NL*
Out
go
the
swordes
to
the
silver
bright
;
*NL*
The
helms
they
to-hewn
and
to-shred
;
*NL*
Out
burst
the
blood
with
stern
streames
red
.
*NL*
Chaucer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Morning
arose
in
unclouded
splendour
,
and
ere
the
sun
was
much
above
the
*NL*
horizon
,
the
idlest
or
the
most
eager
of
the
spectators
appeared
on
the
*NL*
common
,
moving
to
the
lists
as
to
a
general
centre
,
in
order
to
secure
a
*NL*
favourable
situation
for
viewing
the
continuation
of
the
expected
games
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
marshals
and
their
attendants
appeared
next
on
the
field
,
together
*NL*
with
the
heralds
,
for
the
purpose
of
receiving
the
names
of
the
knights
*NL*
who
intended
to
joust
,
with
the
side
which
each
chose
to
espouse
.
This
*NL*
was
a
necessary
precaution
,
in
order
to
secure
equality
betwixt
the
two
*NL*
bodies
who
should
be
opposed
to
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
According
to
due
formality
,
the
Disinherited
Knight
was
to
be
considered
*NL*
as
leader
of
the
one
body
,
while
Brian
de
Bois-Guilbert
,
who
had
been
*NL*
rated
as
having
done
second-best
in
the
preceding
day
,
was
named
first
*NL*
champion
of
the
other
band
.
Those
who
had
concurred
in
the
challenge
*NL*
adhered
to
his
party
of
course
,
excepting
only
Ralph
de
Vipont
,
whom
his
*NL*
fall
had
rendered
unfit
so
soon
to
put
on
his
armour
.
There
was
no
want
*NL*
of
distinguished
and
noble
candidates
to
fill
up
the
ranks
on
either
*NL*
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
,
although
the
general
tournament
,
in
which
all
knights
fought
*NL*
at
once
,
was
more
dangerous
than
single
encounters
,
they
were
,
*NL*
nevertheless
,
more
frequented
and
practised
by
the
chivalry
of
the
age
.
*NL*
Many
knights
,
who
had
not
sufficient
confidence
in
their
own
skill
to
*NL*
defy
a
single
adversary
of
high
reputation
,
were
,
nevertheless
,
desirous
*NL*
of
displaying
their
valour
in
the
general
combat
,
where
they
might
*NL*
meet
others
with
whom
they
were
more
upon
an
equality
.
On
the
present
*NL*
occasion
,
about
fifty
knights
were
inscribed
as
desirous
of
combating
*NL*
upon
each
side
,
when
the
marshals
declared
that
no
more
could
be
*NL*
admitted
,
to
the
disappointment
of
several
who
were
too
late
in
*NL*
preferring
their
claim
to
be
included
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
the
hour
of
ten
o'clock
,
the
whole
plain
was
crowded
with
*NL*
horsemen
,
horsewomen
,
and
foot-passengers
,
hastening
to
the
tournament
;
*NL*
and
shortly
after
,
a
grand
flourish
of
trumpets
announced
Prince
John
*NL*
and
his
retinue
,
attended
by
many
of
those
knights
who
meant
to
take
*NL*
share
in
the
game
,
as
well
as
others
who
had
no
such
intention
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
the
same
time
arrived
Cedric
the
Saxon
,
with
the
Lady
Rowena
,
*NL*
unattended
,
however
,
by
Athelstane
.
This
Saxon
lord
had
arrayed
his
*NL*
tall
and
strong
person
in
armour
,
in
order
to
take
his
place
among
the
*NL*
combatants
;
and
,
considerably
to
the
surprise
of
Cedric
,
had
chosen
to
*NL*
enlist
himself
on
the
part
of
the
Knight
Templar
.
The
Saxon
,
indeed
,
had
*NL*
remonstrated
strongly
with
his
friend
upon
the
injudicious
choice
he
had
*NL*
made
of
his
party
;
but
he
had
only
received
that
sort
of
answer
usually
*NL*
given
by
those
who
are
more
obstinate
in
following
their
own
course
,
*NL*
than
strong
in
justifying
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
best
,
if
not
his
only
reason
,
for
adhering
to
the
party
of
Brian
de
*NL*
Bois-Guilbert
,
Athelstane
had
the
prudence
to
keep
to
himself
.
Though
*NL*
his
apathy
of
disposition
prevented
his
taking
any
means
to
recommend
*NL*
himself
to
the
Lady
Rowena
,
he
was
,
nevertheless
,
by
no
means
insensible
*NL*
to
her
charms
,
and
considered
his
union
with
her
as
a
matter
already
*NL*
fixed
beyond
doubt
,
by
the
assent
of
Cedric
and
her
other
friends
.
It
*NL*
had
therefore
been
with
smothered
displeasure
that
the
proud
though
*NL*
indolent
Lord
of
Coningsburgh
beheld
the
victor
of
the
preceding
day
*NL*
select
Rowena
as
the
object
of
that
honour
which
it
became
his
privilege
*NL*
to
confer
.
In
order
to
punish
him
for
a
preference
which
seemed
to
*NL*
interfere
with
his
own
suit
,
Athelstane
,
confident
of
his
strength
,
*NL*
and
to
whom
his
flatterers
,
at
least
,
ascribed
great
skill
in
arms
,
had
*NL*
determined
not
only
to
deprive
the
Disinherited
Knight
of
his
powerful
*NL*
succour
,
but
,
if
an
opportunity
should
occur
,
to
make
him
feel
the
*NL*
weight
of
his
battle-axe
.
*NL*
*NL*
De
Bracy
,
and
other
knights
attached
to
Prince
John
,
in
obedience
to
*NL*
a
hint
from
him
,
had
joined
the
party
of
the
challengers
,
John
being
*NL*
desirous
to
secure
,
if
possible
,
the
victory
to
that
side
.
On
the
*NL*
other
hand
,
many
other
knights
,
both
English
and
Norman
,
natives
and
*NL*
strangers
,
took
part
against
the
challengers
,
the
more
readily
that
*NL*
the
opposite
band
was
to
be
led
by
so
distinguished
a
champion
as
the
*NL*
Disinherited
Knight
had
approved
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
Prince
John
observed
that
the
destined
Queen
of
the
day
had
*NL*
arrived
upon
the
field
,
assuming
that
air
of
courtesy
which
sat
well
*NL*
upon
him
when
he
was
pleased
to
exhibit
it
,
he
rode
forward
to
meet
*NL*
her
,
doffed
his
bonnet
,
and
,
alighting
from
his
horse
,
assisted
the
Lady
*NL*
Rowena
from
her
saddle
,
while
his
followers
uncovered
at
the
same
time
,
*NL*
and
one
of
the
most
distinguished
dismounted
to
hold
her
palfrey
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
thus
,
''
said
Prince
John
,
``
that
we
set
the
dutiful
example
of
*NL*
loyalty
to
the
Queen
of
Love
and
Beauty
,
and
are
ourselves
her
guide
to
*NL*
the
throne
which
she
must
this
day
occupy
.
--
Ladies
,
''
he
said
,
``
attend
*NL*
your
Queen
,
as
you
wish
in
your
turn
to
be
distinguished
by
like
*NL*
honours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
the
Prince
marshalled
Rowena
to
the
seat
of
honour
opposite
*NL*
his
own
,
while
the
fairest
and
most
distinguished
ladies
present
crowded
*NL*
after
her
to
obtain
places
as
near
as
possible
to
their
temporary
*NL*
sovereign
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
sooner
was
Rowena
seated
,
than
a
burst
of
music
,
half-drowned
by
*NL*
the
shouts
of
the
multitude
,
greeted
her
new
dignity
.
Meantime
,
the
sun
*NL*
shone
fierce
and
bright
upon
the
polished
arms
of
the
knights
of
either
*NL*
side
,
who
crowded
the
opposite
extremities
of
the
lists
,
and
held
eager
*NL*
conference
together
concerning
the
best
mode
of
arranging
their
line
of
*NL*
battle
,
and
supporting
the
conflict
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
heralds
then
proclaimed
silence
until
the
laws
of
the
tourney
should
*NL*
be
rehearsed
.
These
were
calculated
in
some
degree
to
abate
the
dangers
*NL*
of
the
day
;
a
precaution
the
more
necessary
,
as
the
conflict
was
to
be
*NL*
maintained
with
sharp
swords
and
pointed
lances
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
champions
were
therefore
prohibited
to
thrust
with
the
sword
,
and
*NL*
were
confined
to
striking
.
A
knight
,
it
was
announced
,
might
use
a
mace
*NL*
or
battle-axe
at
pleasure
,
but
the
dagger
was
a
prohibited
weapon
.
A
*NL*
knight
unhorsed
might
renew
the
fight
on
foot
with
any
other
on
the
*NL*
opposite
side
in
the
same
predicament
;
but
mounted
horsemen
were
in
that
*NL*
case
forbidden
to
assail
him
.
When
any
knight
could
force
his
antagonist
*NL*
to
the
extremity
of
the
lists
,
so
as
to
touch
the
palisade
with
his
*NL*
person
or
arms
,
such
opponent
was
obliged
to
yield
himself
vanquished
,
*NL*
and
his
armour
and
horse
were
placed
at
the
disposal
of
the
conqueror
.
*NL*
A
knight
thus
overcome
was
not
permitted
to
take
farther
share
in
the
*NL*
combat
.
If
any
combatant
was
struck
down
,
and
unable
to
recover
his
*NL*
feet
,
his
squire
or
page
might
enter
the
lists
,
and
drag
his
master
out
*NL*
of
the
press
;
but
in
that
case
the
knight
was
adjudged
vanquished
,
and
*NL*
his
arms
and
horse
declared
forfeited
.
The
combat
was
to
cease
as
*NL*
soon
as
Prince
John
should
throw
down
his
leading
staff
,
or
truncheon
;
*NL*
another
precaution
usually
taken
to
prevent
the
unnecessary
effusion
*NL*
of
blood
by
the
too
long
endurance
of
a
sport
so
desperate
.
Any
knight
*NL*
breaking
the
rules
of
the
tournament
,
or
otherwise
transgressing
the
*NL*
rules
of
honourable
chivalry
,
was
liable
to
be
stript
of
his
arms
,
and
,
*NL*
having
his
shield
reversed
to
be
placed
in
that
posture
astride
upon
the
*NL*
bars
of
the
palisade
,
and
exposed
to
public
derision
,
in
punishment
of
*NL*
his
unknightly
conduct
.
Having
announced
these
precautions
,
the
heralds
*NL*
concluded
with
an
exhortation
to
each
good
knight
to
do
his
duty
,
and
to
*NL*
merit
favour
from
the
Queen
of
Beauty
and
of
Love
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
proclamation
having
been
made
,
the
heralds
withdrew
to
their
*NL*
stations
.
The
knights
,
entering
at
either
end
of
the
lists
in
long
*NL*
procession
,
arranged
themselves
in
a
double
file
,
precisely
opposite
to
*NL*
each
other
,
the
leader
of
each
party
being
in
the
centre
of
the
foremost
*NL*
rank
,
a
post
which
he
did
not
occupy
until
each
had
carefully
marshalled
*NL*
the
ranks
of
his
party
,
and
stationed
every
one
in
his
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
goodly
,
and
at
the
same
time
an
anxious
,
sight
,
to
behold
so
*NL*
many
gallant
champions
,
mounted
bravely
,
and
armed
richly
,
stand
ready
*NL*
prepared
for
an
encounter
so
formidable
,
seated
on
their
war-saddles
*NL*
like
so
many
pillars
of
iron
,
and
awaiting
the
signal
of
encounter
with
*NL*
the
same
ardour
as
their
generous
steeds
,
which
,
by
neighing
and
pawing
*NL*
the
ground
,
gave
signal
of
their
impatience
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
yet
the
knights
held
their
long
lances
upright
,
their
bright
points
*NL*
glancing
to
the
sun
,
and
the
streamers
with
which
they
were
decorated
*NL*
fluttering
over
the
plumage
of
the
helmets
.
Thus
they
remained
while
the
*NL*
marshals
of
the
field
surveyed
their
ranks
with
the
utmost
exactness
,
*NL*
lest
either
party
had
more
or
fewer
than
the
appointed
number
.
The
tale
*NL*
was
found
exactly
complete
.
The
marshals
then
withdrew
from
the
lists
,
*NL*
and
William
de
Wyvil
,
with
a
voice
of
thunder
,
pronounced
the
signal
*NL*
words
--
``
Laissez
aller
!
''
The
trumpets
sounded
as
he
spoke
--
the
spears
of
*NL*
the
champions
were
at
once
lowered
and
placed
in
the
rests
--
the
spurs
*NL*
were
dashed
into
the
flanks
of
the
horses
,
and
the
two
foremost
ranks
*NL*
of
either
party
rushed
upon
each
other
in
full
gallop
,
and
met
in
the
*NL*
middle
of
the
lists
with
a
shock
,
the
sound
of
which
was
heard
at
a
*NL*
mile
's
distance
.
The
rear
rank
of
each
party
advanced
at
a
slower
pace
*NL*
to
sustain
the
defeated
,
and
follow
up
the
success
of
the
victors
of
*NL*
their
party
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
consequences
of
the
encounter
were
not
instantly
seen
,
for
the
dust
*NL*
raised
by
the
trampling
of
so
many
steeds
darkened
the
air
,
and
it
was
*NL*
a
minute
ere
the
anxious
spectator
could
see
the
fate
of
the
encounter
.
*NL*
When
the
fight
became
visible
,
half
the
knights
on
each
side
were
*NL*
dismounted
,
some
by
the
dexterity
of
their
adversary
's
lance
,
--
some
by
*NL*
the
superior
weight
and
strength
of
opponents
,
which
had
borne
down
*NL*
both
horse
and
man
,
--
some
lay
stretched
on
earth
as
if
never
more
to
*NL*
rise
,
--
some
had
already
gained
their
feet
,
and
were
closing
hand
to
hand
*NL*
with
those
of
their
antagonists
who
were
in
the
same
predicament
,
--
and
*NL*
several
on
both
sides
,
who
had
received
wounds
by
which
they
were
*NL*
disabled
,
were
stopping
their
blood
by
their
scarfs
,
and
endeavouring
to
*NL*
extricate
themselves
from
the
tumult
.
The
mounted
knights
,
whose
lances
*NL*
had
been
almost
all
broken
by
the
fury
of
the
encounter
,
were
now
*NL*
closely
engaged
with
their
swords
,
shouting
their
war-cries
,
and
*NL*
exchanging
buffets
,
as
if
honour
and
life
depended
on
the
issue
of
the
*NL*
combat
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tumult
was
presently
increased
by
the
advance
of
the
second
rank
*NL*
on
either
side
,
which
,
acting
as
a
reserve
,
now
rushed
on
to
aid
their
*NL*
companions
.
The
followers
of
Brian
de
Bois-Guilbert
shouted
--
``
Ha
!
*NL*
Beau-seant
!
Beau-seant
!
-LSB-
20
-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
''
--
For
the
Temple
--
For
the
Temple
!
''
The
opposite
party
shouted
in
*NL*
answer
--
``
Desdichado
!
Desdichado
!
''
--
which
watch-word
they
took
from
the
*NL*
motto
upon
their
leader
's
shield
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
champions
thus
encountering
each
other
with
the
utmost
fury
,
and
*NL*
with
alternate
success
,
the
tide
of
battle
seemed
to
flow
now
toward
the
*NL*
southern
,
now
toward
the
northern
extremity
of
the
lists
,
as
the
one
*NL*
or
the
other
party
prevailed
.
Meantime
the
clang
of
the
blows
,
and
*NL*
the
shouts
of
the
combatants
,
mixed
fearfully
with
the
sound
of
the
*NL*
trumpets
,
and
drowned
the
groans
of
those
who
fell
,
and
lay
rolling
*NL*
defenceless
beneath
the
feet
of
the
horses
.
The
splendid
armour
of
the
*NL*
combatants
was
now
defaced
with
dust
and
blood
,
and
gave
way
at
every
*NL*
stroke
of
the
sword
and
battle-axe
.
The
gay
plumage
,
shorn
from
the
*NL*
crests
,
drifted
upon
the
breeze
like
snow-flakes
.
All
that
was
beautiful
*NL*
and
graceful
in
the
martial
array
had
disappeared
,
and
what
was
now
*NL*
visible
was
only
calculated
to
awake
terror
or
compassion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
such
is
the
force
of
habit
,
that
not
only
the
vulgar
spectators
,
*NL*
who
are
naturally
attracted
by
sights
of
horror
,
but
even
the
ladies
of
*NL*
distinction
who
crowded
the
galleries
,
saw
the
conflict
with
a
thrilling
*NL*
interest
certainly
,
but
without
a
wish
to
withdraw
their
eyes
from
a
*NL*
sight
so
terrible
.
Here
and
there
,
indeed
,
a
fair
cheek
might
turn
pale
,
*NL*
or
a
faint
scream
might
be
heard
,
as
a
lover
,
a
brother
,
or
a
husband
,
*NL*
was
struck
from
his
horse
.
But
,
in
general
,
the
ladies
around
encouraged
*NL*
the
combatants
,
not
only
by
clapping
their
hands
and
waving
their
veils
*NL*
and
kerchiefs
,
but
even
by
exclaiming
,
``
Brave
lance
!
Good
sword
!
''
when
*NL*
any
successful
thrust
or
blow
took
place
under
their
observation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
being
the
interest
taken
by
the
fair
sex
in
this
bloody
game
,
*NL*
that
of
the
men
is
the
more
easily
understood
.
It
showed
itself
in
*NL*
loud
acclamations
upon
every
change
of
fortune
,
while
all
eyes
were
so
*NL*
riveted
on
the
lists
,
that
the
spectators
seemed
as
if
they
themselves
*NL*
had
dealt
and
received
the
blows
which
were
there
so
freely
bestowed
.
*NL*
And
between
every
pause
was
heard
the
voice
of
the
heralds
,
exclaiming
,
*NL*
``
Fight
on
,
brave
knights
!
Man
dies
,
but
glory
lives
!
--
Fight
on
--
death
*NL*
is
better
than
defeat
!
--
Fight
on
,
brave
knights
!
--
for
bright
eyes
behold
*NL*
your
deeds
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amid
the
varied
fortunes
of
the
combat
,
the
eyes
of
all
endeavoured
to
*NL*
discover
the
leaders
of
each
band
,
who
,
mingling
in
the
thick
of
the
*NL*
fight
,
encouraged
their
companions
both
by
voice
and
example
.
Both
*NL*
displayed
great
feats
of
gallantry
,
nor
did
either
Bois-Guilbert
or
the
*NL*
Disinherited
Knight
find
in
the
ranks
opposed
to
them
a
champion
who
*NL*
could
be
termed
their
unquestioned
match
.
They
repeatedly
endeavoured
to
*NL*
single
out
each
other
,
spurred
by
mutual
animosity
,
and
aware
that
the
*NL*
fall
of
either
leader
might
be
considered
as
decisive
of
victory
.
Such
,
*NL*
however
,
was
the
crowd
and
confusion
,
that
,
during
the
earlier
part
*NL*
of
the
conflict
,
their
efforts
to
meet
were
unavailing
,
and
they
were
*NL*
repeatedly
separated
by
the
eagerness
of
their
followers
,
each
of
whom
*NL*
was
anxious
to
win
honour
,
by
measuring
his
strength
against
the
leader
*NL*
of
the
opposite
party
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
the
field
became
thin
by
the
numbers
on
either
side
who
had
*NL*
yielded
themselves
vanquished
,
had
been
compelled
to
the
extremity
*NL*
of
the
lists
,
or
been
otherwise
rendered
incapable
of
continuing
the
*NL*
strife
,
the
Templar
and
the
Disinherited
Knight
at
length
encountered
*NL*
hand
to
hand
,
with
all
the
fury
that
mortal
animosity
,
joined
to
rivalry
*NL*
of
honour
,
could
inspire
.
Such
was
the
address
of
each
in
parrying
*NL*
and
striking
,
that
the
spectators
broke
forth
into
a
unanimous
and
*NL*
involuntary
shout
,
expressive
of
their
delight
and
admiration
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
this
moment
the
party
of
the
Disinherited
Knight
had
the
worst
;
*NL*
the
gigantic
arm
of
Front-de-Boeuf
on
the
one
flank
,
and
the
ponderous
*NL*
strength
of
Athelstane
on
the
other
,
bearing
down
and
dispersing
*NL*
those
immediately
exposed
to
them
.
Finding
themselves
freed
from
their
*NL*
immediate
antagonists
,
it
seems
to
have
occurred
to
both
these
knights
*NL*
at
the
same
instant
,
that
they
would
render
the
most
decisive
advantage
*NL*
to
their
party
,
by
aiding
the
Templar
in
his
contest
with
his
rival
.
*NL*
Turning
their
horses
,
therefore
,
at
the
same
moment
,
the
Norman
spurred
*NL*
against
the
Disinherited
Knight
on
the
one
side
,
and
the
Saxon
on
the
*NL*
other
.
It
was
utterly
impossible
that
the
object
of
this
unequal
and
*NL*
unexpected
assault
could
have
sustained
it
,
had
he
not
been
warned
by
a
*NL*
general
cry
from
the
spectators
,
who
could
not
but
take
interest
in
one
*NL*
exposed
to
such
disadvantage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Beware
!
beware
!
Sir
Disinherited
!
''
was
shouted
so
universally
,
that
*NL*
the
knight
became
aware
of
his
danger
;
and
,
striking
a
full
blow
at
the
*NL*
Templar
,
he
reined
back
his
steed
in
the
same
moment
,
so
as
to
escape
*NL*
the
charge
of
Athelstane
and
Front-de-Boeuf
.
These
knights
,
therefore
,
*NL*
their
aim
being
thus
eluded
,
rushed
from
opposite
sides
betwixt
the
*NL*
object
of
their
attack
and
the
Templar
,
almost
running
their
horses
*NL*
against
each
other
ere
they
could
stop
their
career
.
Recovering
their
*NL*
horses
however
,
and
wheeling
them
round
,
the
whole
three
pursued
their
*NL*
united
purpose
of
bearing
to
the
earth
the
Disinherited
Knight
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
could
have
saved
him
,
except
the
remarkable
strength
and
*NL*
activity
of
the
noble
horse
which
he
had
won
on
the
preceding
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
stood
him
in
the
more
stead
,
as
the
horse
of
Bois-Guilbert
was
*NL*
wounded
,
and
those
of
Front-de-Boeuf
and
Athelstane
were
both
tired
with
*NL*
the
weight
of
their
gigantic
masters
,
clad
in
complete
armour
,
and
with
*NL*
the
preceding
exertions
of
the
day
.
The
masterly
horsemanship
of
the
*NL*
Disinherited
Knight
,
and
the
activity
of
the
noble
animal
which
he
*NL*
mounted
,
enabled
him
for
a
few
minutes
to
keep
at
sword
's
point
his
*NL*
three
antagonists
,
turning
and
wheeling
with
the
agility
of
a
hawk
upon
*NL*
the
wing
,
keeping
his
enemies
as
far
separate
as
he
could
,
and
rushing
*NL*
now
against
the
one
,
now
against
the
other
,
dealing
sweeping
blows
with
*NL*
his
sword
,
without
waiting
to
receive
those
which
were
aimed
at
him
in
*NL*
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
although
the
lists
rang
with
the
applauses
of
his
dexterity
,
it
*NL*
was
evident
that
he
must
at
last
be
overpowered
;
and
the
nobles
around
*NL*
Prince
John
implored
him
with
one
voice
to
throw
down
his
warder
,
and
to
*NL*
save
so
brave
a
knight
from
the
disgrace
of
being
overcome
by
odds
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
I
,
by
the
light
of
Heaven
!
''
answered
Prince
John
;
``
this
*NL*
same
springald
,
who
conceals
his
name
,
and
despises
our
proffered
*NL*
hospitality
,
hath
already
gained
one
prize
,
and
may
now
afford
to
*NL*
let
others
have
their
turn
.
''
As
he
spoke
thus
,
an
unexpected
incident
*NL*
changed
the
fortune
of
the
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
among
the
ranks
of
the
Disinherited
Knight
a
champion
in
*NL*
black
armour
,
mounted
on
a
black
horse
,
large
of
size
,
tall
,
and
to
all
*NL*
appearance
powerful
and
strong
,
like
the
rider
by
whom
he
was
mounted
.
*NL*
This
knight
,
who
bore
on
his
shield
no
device
of
any
kind
,
had
hitherto
*NL*
evinced
very
little
interest
in
the
event
of
the
fight
,
beating
off
with
*NL*
seeming
ease
those
combatants
who
attacked
him
,
but
neither
pursuing
*NL*
his
advantages
,
nor
himself
assailing
any
one
.
In
short
,
he
had
hitherto
*NL*
acted
the
part
rather
of
a
spectator
than
of
a
party
in
the
tournament
,
*NL*
a
circumstance
which
procured
him
among
the
spectators
the
name
of
``
Le
*NL*
Noir
Faineant
''
,
or
the
Black
Sluggard
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
once
this
knight
seemed
to
throw
aside
his
apathy
,
when
he
discovered
*NL*
the
leader
of
his
party
so
hard
bestead
;
for
,
setting
spurs
to
*NL*
his
horse
,
which
was
quite
fresh
,
he
came
to
his
assistance
like
a
*NL*
thunderbolt
,
exclaiming
,
in
a
voice
like
a
trumpet-call
,
``
Desdichado
,
*NL*
to
the
rescue
!
''
It
was
high
time
;
for
,
while
the
Disinherited
Knight
was
*NL*
pressing
upon
the
Templar
,
Front-de-Boeuf
had
got
nigh
to
him
with
his
*NL*
uplifted
sword
;
but
ere
the
blow
could
descend
,
the
Sable
Knight
dealt
*NL*
a
stroke
on
his
head
,
which
,
glancing
from
the
polished
helmet
,
lighted
*NL*
with
violence
scarcely
abated
on
the
``
chamfron
''
of
the
steed
,
and
*NL*
Front-de-Boeuf
rolled
on
the
ground
,
both
horse
and
man
equally
stunned
*NL*
by
the
fury
of
the
blow
.
``
Le
Noir
Faineant
''
then
turned
his
horse
upon
*NL*
Athelstane
of
Coningsburgh
;
and
his
own
sword
having
been
broken
in
his
*NL*
encounter
with
Front-de-Boeuf
,
he
wrenched
from
the
hand
of
the
bulky
*NL*
Saxon
the
battle-axe
which
he
wielded
,
and
,
like
one
familiar
with
*NL*
the
use
of
the
weapon
,
bestowed
him
such
a
blow
upon
the
crest
,
that
*NL*
Athelstane
also
lay
senseless
on
the
field
.
Having
achieved
this
double
*NL*
feat
,
for
which
he
was
the
more
highly
applauded
that
it
was
totally
*NL*
unexpected
from
him
,
the
knight
seemed
to
resume
the
sluggishness
of
*NL*
his
character
,
returning
calmly
to
the
northern
extremity
of
the
lists
,
*NL*
leaving
his
leader
to
cope
as
he
best
could
with
Brian
de
Bois-Guilbert
.
*NL*
This
was
no
longer
matter
of
so
much
difficulty
as
formerly
.
The
*NL*
Templars
horse
had
bled
much
,
and
gave
way
under
the
shock
of
the
*NL*
Disinherited
Knight
's
charge
.
Brian
de
Bois-Guilbert
rolled
on
the
*NL*
field
,
encumbered
with
the
stirrup
,
from
which
he
was
unable
to
draw
his
*NL*
foot
.
His
antagonist
sprung
from
horseback
,
waved
his
fatal
sword
over
*NL*
the
head
of
his
adversary
,
and
commanded
him
to
yield
himself
;
when
*NL*
Prince
John
,
more
moved
by
the
Templars
dangerous
situation
than
he
had
*NL*
been
by
that
of
his
rival
,
saved
him
the
mortification
of
confessing
*NL*
himself
vanquished
,
by
casting
down
his
warder
,
and
putting
an
end
to
*NL*
the
conflict
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
,
indeed
,
only
the
relics
and
embers
of
the
fight
which
continued
*NL*
to
burn
;
for
of
the
few
knights
who
still
continued
in
the
lists
,
the
*NL*
greater
part
had
,
by
tacit
consent
,
forborne
the
conflict
for
some
time
,
*NL*
leaving
it
to
be
determined
by
the
strife
of
the
leaders
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
squires
,
who
had
found
it
a
matter
of
danger
and
difficulty
to
*NL*
attend
their
masters
during
the
engagement
,
now
thronged
into
the
lists
*NL*
to
pay
their
dutiful
attendance
to
the
wounded
,
who
were
removed
with
*NL*
the
utmost
care
and
attention
to
the
neighbouring
pavilions
,
or
to
the
*NL*
quarters
prepared
for
them
in
the
adjoining
village
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
ended
the
memorable
field
of
Ashby-de-la-Zouche
,
one
of
the
most
*NL*
gallantly
contested
tournaments
of
that
age
;
for
although
only
four
*NL*
knights
,
including
one
who
was
smothered
by
the
heat
of
his
armour
,
had
*NL*
died
upon
the
field
,
yet
upwards
of
thirty
were
desperately
wounded
,
*NL*
four
or
five
of
whom
never
recovered
.
Several
more
were
disabled
for
*NL*
life
;
and
those
who
escaped
best
carried
the
marks
of
the
conflict
to
*NL*
the
grave
with
them
.
Hence
it
is
always
mentioned
in
the
old
records
,
as
*NL*
the
Gentle
and
Joyous
Passage
of
Arms
of
Ashby
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
being
now
the
duty
of
Prince
John
to
name
the
knight
who
had
done
*NL*
best
,
he
determined
that
the
honour
of
the
day
remained
with
the
knight
*NL*
whom
the
popular
voice
had
termed
``
Le
Noir
Faineant
.
''
It
was
pointed
out
*NL*
to
the
Prince
,
in
impeachment
of
this
decree
,
that
the
victory
had
been
*NL*
in
fact
won
by
the
Disinherited
Knight
,
who
,
in
the
course
of
the
*NL*
day
,
had
overcome
six
champions
with
his
own
hand
,
and
who
had
finally
*NL*
unhorsed
and
struck
down
the
leader
of
the
opposite
party
.
But
Prince
*NL*
John
adhered
to
his
own
opinion
,
on
the
ground
that
the
Disinherited
*NL*
Knight
and
his
party
had
lost
the
day
,
but
for
the
powerful
assistance
*NL*
of
the
Knight
of
the
Black
Armour
,
to
whom
,
therefore
,
he
persisted
in
*NL*
awarding
the
prize
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
the
surprise
of
all
present
,
however
,
the
knight
thus
preferred
was
*NL*
nowhere
to
be
found
.
He
had
left
the
lists
immediately
when
the
conflict
*NL*
ceased
,
and
had
been
observed
by
some
spectators
to
move
down
one
of
*NL*
the
forest
glades
with
the
same
slow
pace
and
listless
and
indifferent
*NL*
manner
which
had
procured
him
the
epithet
of
the
Black
Sluggard
.
After
*NL*
he
had
been
summoned
twice
by
sound
of
trumpet
,
and
proclamation
of
*NL*
the
heralds
,
it
became
necessary
to
name
another
to
receive
the
honours
*NL*
which
had
been
assigned
to
him
.
Prince
John
had
now
no
further
excuse
*NL*
for
resisting
the
claim
of
the
Disinherited
Knight
,
whom
,
therefore
,
he
*NL*
named
the
champion
of
the
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Through
a
field
slippery
with
blood
,
and
encumbered
with
broken
armour
*NL*
and
the
bodies
of
slain
and
wounded
horses
,
the
marshals
of
the
lists
*NL*
again
conducted
the
victor
to
the
foot
of
Prince
John
's
throne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Disinherited
Knight
,
''
said
Prince
John
,
``
since
by
that
title
only
*NL*
you
will
consent
to
be
known
to
us
,
we
a
second

honours

and

from

hands
of
the
Queen
of
Love
and
Beauty

the
Chaplet
of
*NL*
Honour
which
your
valour
has
justly
deserved
.
''
The
Knight
bowed
low
and
*NL*
gracefully
,
but
returned
no
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
trumpets
sounded
,
while
the
heralds
strained
their
voices
in
*NL*
proclaiming
honour
to
the
brave
and
glory
to
the
victor
--
while
ladies
*NL*
waved
their
silken
kerchiefs
and
embroidered
veils
,
and
while
all
ranks
*NL*
joined
in
a
clamorous
shout
of
exultation
,
the
marshals
conducted
the
*NL*
Disinherited
Knight
across
the
lists
to
the
foot
of
that
throne
of
*NL*
honour
which
was
occupied
by
the
Lady
Rowena
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
lower
step
of
this
throne
the
champion
was
made
to
kneel
down
.
*NL*
Indeed
his
whole
action
since
the
fight
had
ended
,
seemed
rather
to
have
*NL*
been
upon
the
impulse
of
those
around
him
than
from
his
own
free
will
;
*NL*
and
it
was
observed
that
he
tottered
as
they
guided
him
the
second
time
*NL*
across
the
lists
.
Rowena
,
descending
from
her
station
with
a
graceful
*NL*
and
dignified
step
,
was
about
to
place
the
chaplet
which
she
held
in
her
*NL*
hand
upon
the
helmet
of
the
champion
,
when
the
marshals
exclaimed
with
*NL*
one
voice
,
``
It
must
not
be
thus
--
his
head
must
be
bare
.
''
The
knight
*NL*
muttered
faintly
a
few
words
,
which
were
lost
in
the
hollow
of
his
*NL*
helmet
,
but
their
purport
seemed
to
be
a
desire
that
his
casque
might
*NL*
not
be
removed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
from
love
of
form
,
or
from
curiosity
,
the
marshals
paid
no
*NL*
attention
to
his
expressions
of
reluctance
,
but
unhelmed
him
by
cutting
*NL*
the
laces
of
his
casque
,
and
undoing
the
fastening
of
his
gorget
.
When
*NL*
the
helmet
was
removed
,
the
well-formed
,
yet
sun-burnt
features
of
a
*NL*
young
man
of
twenty-five
were
seen
,
amidst
a
profusion
of
short
fair
*NL*
hair
.
His
countenance
was
as
pale
as
death
,
and
marked
in
one
or
two
*NL*
places
with
streaks
of
blood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rowena
had
no
sooner
beheld
him
than
she
uttered
a
faint
shriek
;
but
at
*NL*
once
summoning
up
the
energy
of
her
disposition
,
and
compelling
herself
,
*NL*
as
it
were
,
to
proceed
,
while
her
frame
yet
trembled
with
the
violence
*NL*
of
sudden
emotion
,
she
placed
upon
the
drooping
head
of
the
victor
*NL*
the
splendid
chaplet
which
was
the
destined
reward
of
the
day
,
and
*NL*
pronounced
,
in
a
clear
and
distinct
tone
,
these
words
:
``
I
bestow
on
thee
*NL*
this
chaplet
,
Sir
Knight
,
as
the
meed
of
valour
assigned
to
this
day
's
*NL*
victor
:
''
Here
she
paused
a
moment
,
and
then
firmly
added
,
``
And
upon
*NL*
brows
more
worthy
could
a
wreath
of
chivalry
never
be
placed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
knight
stooped
his
head
,
and
kissed
the
hand
of
the
lovely
Sovereign
*NL*
by
whom
his
valour
had
been
rewarded
;
and
then
,
sinking
yet
farther
*NL*
forward
,
lay
prostrate
at
her
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
general
consternation
.
Cedric
,
who
had
been
struck
mute
by
*NL*
the
sudden
appearance
of
his
banished
son
,
now
rushed
forward
,
as
if
to
*NL*
separate
him
from
Rowena
.
But
this
had
been
already
accomplished
by
the
*NL*
marshals
of
the
field
,
who
,
guessing
the
cause
of
Ivanhoe
's
swoon
,
had
*NL*
hastened
to
undo
his
armour
,
and
found
that
the
head
of
a
lance
had
*NL*
penetrated
his
breastplate
,
and
inflicted
a
wound
in
his
side
.

Iliad
*NL*
*NL*
The
name
of
Ivanhoe
was
no
sooner
pronounced
than
it
flew
from
mouth
*NL*
to
mouth
,
with
all
the
celerity
with
which
eagerness
could
convey
and
*NL*
curiosity
receive
it
.
It
was
not
long
ere
it
reached
the
circle
of
the
*NL*
Prince
,
whose
brow
darkened
as
he
heard
the
news
.
Looking
around
him
,
*NL*
however
,
with
an
air
of
scorn
,
``
My
Lords
,
''
said
he
,
``
and
especially
you
,
*NL*
Sir
Prior
,
what
think
ye
of
the
doctrine
the
learned
tell
us
,
concerning
*NL*
innate
attractions
and
antipathies
?
Methinks
that
I
felt
the
presence
*NL*
of
my
brother
's
minion
,
even
when
I
least
guessed
whom
yonder
suit
of
*NL*
armour
enclosed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Front-de-Boeuf
must
prepare
to
restore
his
fief
of
Ivanhoe
,
''
said
De
*NL*
Bracy
,
who
,
having
discharged
his
part
honourably
in
the
tournament
,
had
*NL*
laid
his
shield
and
helmet
aside
,
and
again
mingled
with
the
Prince
's
*NL*
retinue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
''
answered
Waldemar
Fitzurse
,
``
this
gallant
is
likely
to
reclaim
*NL*
the
castle
and
manor
which
Richard
assigned
to
him
,
and
which
your
*NL*
Highness
's
generosity
has
since
given
to
Front-de-Boeuf
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Front-de-Boeuf
,
''
replied
John
,
``
is
a
man
more
willing
to
swallow
three
*NL*
manors
such
as
Ivanhoe
,
than
to
disgorge
one
of
them
.
For
the
rest
,
*NL*
sirs
,
I
hope
none
here
will
deny
my
right
to
confer
the
fiefs
of
the
*NL*
crown
upon
the
faithful
followers
who
are
around
me
,
and
ready
to
*NL*
perform
the
usual
military
service
,
in
the
room
of
those
who
have
*NL*
wandered
to
foreign
Countries
,
and
can
neither
render
homage
nor
service
*NL*
when
called
upon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
audience
were
too
much
interested
in
the
question
not
to
pronounce
*NL*
the
Prince
's
assumed
right
altogether
indubitable
.
``
A
generous
*NL*
Prince
!
--
a
most
noble
Lord
,
who
thus
takes
upon
himself
the
task
of
*NL*
rewarding
his
faithful
followers
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Such
were
the
words
which
burst
from
the
train
,
expectants
all
of
*NL*
them
of
similar
grants
at
the
expense
of
King
Richard
's
followers
and
*NL*
favourites
,
if
indeed
they
had
not
as
yet
received
such
.
Prior
Aymer
*NL*
also
assented
to
the
general
proposition
,
observing
,
however
,
``
That
the
*NL*
blessed
Jerusalem
could
not
indeed
be
termed
a
foreign
country
.
She
*NL*
was
`
communis
mater
'
--
the
mother
of
all
Christians
.
But
he
saw
not
,
''
*NL*
he
declared
,
``
how
the
Knight
of
Ivanhoe
could
plead
any
advantage
from
*NL*
this
,
since
he
''
-LRB-
the
Prior
-RRB-
``
was
assured
that
the
crusaders
,
under
*NL*
Richard
,
had
never
proceeded
much
farther
than
Askalon
,
which
,
as
all
*NL*
the
world
knew
,
was
a
town
of
the
Philistines
,
and
entitled
to
none
of
*NL*
the
privileges
of
the
Holy
City
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Waldemar
,
whose
curiosity
had
led
him
towards
the
place
where
Ivanhoe
*NL*
had
fallen
to
the
ground
,
now
returned
.
``
The
gallant
,
''
said
he
,
*NL*
``
is
likely
to
give
your
Highness
little
disturbance
,
and
to
leave
*NL*
Front-de-Boeuf
in
the
quiet
possession
of
his
gains
--
he
is
severely
*NL*
wounded
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whatever
becomes
of
him
,
''
said
Prince
John
,
``
he
is
victor
of
the
day
;
*NL*
and
were
he
tenfold
our
enemy
,
or
the
devoted
friend
of
our
brother
,
*NL*
which
is
perhaps
the
same
,
his
wounds
must
be
looked
to
--
our
own
*NL*
physician
shall
attend
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
stern
smile
curled
the
Prince
's
lip
as
he
spoke
.
Waldemar
Fitzurse
*NL*
hastened
to
reply
,
that
Ivanhoe
was
already
removed
from
the
lists
,
and
*NL*
in
the
custody
of
his
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
somewhat
afflicted
,
''
he
said
,
``
to
see
the
grief
of
the
Queen
of
*NL*
Love
and
Beauty
,
whose
sovereignty
of
a
day
this
event
has
changed
into
*NL*
mourning
.
I
am
not
a
man
to
be
moved
by
a
woman
's
lament
for
her
lover
,
*NL*
but
this
same
Lady
Rowena
suppressed
her
sorrow
with
such
dignity
of
*NL*
manner
,
that
it
could
only
be
discovered
by
her
folded
hands
,
and
her
*NL*
tearless
eye
,
which
trembled
as
it
remained
fixed
on
the
lifeless
form
*NL*
before
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
this
Lady
Rowena
,

said
Prince
John
,
``
of
whom
we
have
heard
so
*NL*
much
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
Saxon
heiress
of
large
possessions

replied
the
Prior
Aymer
;
``
a
rose
*NL*
of
loveliness
,
and
a
jewel
of
wealth
;
the
fairest
among
a
thousand
,
a
*NL*
bundle
of
myrrh
,
and
a
cluster
of
camphire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
cheer
her
sorrows
,
''
said
Prince
John
,
``
and
amend
her
blood
,
by

wedding
her
to
a
Norman

She
seems
a
minor

therefore
be
at
our
*NL*
royal
disposal
in
marriage

How
sayst
thou
,
De
Bracy
?
What
thinkst
thou
*NL*
of
gaining
fair
lands

livings

by
wedding
a
Saxon
,
after
the
fashion
*NL*
of
the
followers
of
the
Conqueror

*NL*
*NL*
``
If
the
lands
are
to
my
liking

answered
De
Bracy
,
``
it
will
be
*NL*
hard
to
displease
me

deeply
will
I
hold

to
your
highness
for
a
good
deed

will
fulfil
all
promises
made
in

favour

*NL*
*NL*
``
We
will
not
forget
it

said
Prince
John
;

may
instantly
go

work

order
the

*NL*
Lady
Rowena

her
company

that

the
rude
churl

guardian

the
Saxon
ox

Black
Knight
struck
down
in
the
tournament
,
upon
*NL*
this
evening

banquet

Bigot

he
added
to
his
seneschal
,
``
thou

wilt
word
this
our
second
summons
so
courteously

to
gratify

pride

Saxons
,

make
it
impossible
for
them
again
to
refuse
;
*NL*
although

by
the
bones

Becket

courtesy
to
them
is
casting
pearls
*NL*
before

''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
John
had
proceeded
thus
far
,
and
was
about
to
give
the
signal
for
*NL*
retiring
from
the
lists
,
when
a
small
billet
was
put
into
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
whence
?

said
Prince
John
,
looking
at
the
person
by
whom
it
was
*NL*
delivered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
foreign
parts
,
my
lord
,
but
from
whence
I
know
not

replied
his
*NL*
attendant
.
``
A
Frenchman
brought
it
hither
,
who
said
,
he
had
ridden
night
*NL*
and
day
to
put
it
into
the
hands
of
your
highness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Prince
looked
narrowly
at
the
superscription
,
and
then
at
the
*NL*
seal
,
placed
so
as
to
secure
the
flex-silk
with
which
the
billet
was
*NL*
surrounded
,
and
which
bore
the
impression
of
three
fleurs-de-lis
.
*NL*
John
then
opened
the
billet
with
apparent
agitation
,
which
visibly
and
*NL*
greatly
increased
when
he
had
perused
the
contents
,
which
were
expressed
*NL*
in
these
words
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
heed
to
yourself
for
the
Devil
is
unchained
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Prince
turned
as
pale
as
death
,
looked
first
on
the
earth
,
and
*NL*
then
up
to
heaven
,
like
a
man
who
has
received
news
that
sentence
of
*NL*
execution
has
been
passed
upon
him
.
Recovering
from
the
first
effects
of
*NL*
his
surprise
,
he
took
Waldemar
Fitzurse
and
De
Bracy
aside
,
and
put
*NL*
the
billet
into
their
hands
successively
.
``
It
means
,
''
he
added
,
in
a
*NL*
faltering
voice
,
``
that
my
brother
Richard
has
obtained
his
freedom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
may
be
a
false
alarm
,
or
a
forged
letter

said
De
Bracy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
France
's
own
hand
and
seal

replied
Prince
John
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
time
,
then

said
Fitzurse
,
``

break
short
this

mummery

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
yeomen

De

,
``

not

*NL*
``

Waldemar
,

very
far
spent

shoot
a
few
rounds
at
the
target

prize
be
adjudged

will
*NL*
be
an
abundant
fulfilment
of

promises

so
far
as
this
herd

of
Saxon
serfs
is
concerned

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thank
thee
,
Waldemar

said
the
Prince
;
``
thou
remindest
me
,
too
,
that

I
have
a
debt
to
pay
to
that
insolent
peasant

insulted
our

banquet
also
shall
go
forward
to-night

we
proposed

an
hour
sacred

come
with
to-morrow

*NL*
*NL*
The
sound
of
the
trumpets
soon
recalled
those
spectators
who
had
already
*NL*
begun
to
leave
the
field
;
and
proclamation
was
made
that
Prince
John
,
*NL*
suddenly
called
by
high
and
peremptory
public
duties

held
himself
*NL*
obliged
to
discontinue

festival
:

Nevertheless

of
skill
,
he
was
pleased
to
appoint
them
,
before
leaving
the
*NL*
ground
,
presently
to
execute
the
competition
of
archery
intended
for
*NL*
the
morrow
.
To
the
best
archer
a
prize
was
to
be
awarded
,
being
a
*NL*
bugle-horn
,
mounted
with
silver
,
and
a
silken
baldric
richly
ornamented
*NL*
with
a
medallion
of
St
Hubert
,
the
patron
of
silvan
sport
.
*NL*
*NL*
More
than
thirty
yeomen
at
first
presented
themselves
as
competitors
,
*NL*
several
of
whom
were
rangers
and
under-keepers
in
the
royal
forests
of
*NL*
Needwood
and
Charnwood
.
When
,
however
,
the
archers
understood
with
whom
*NL*
they
were
to
be
matched
,
upwards
of
twenty
withdrew
themselves
from
the
*NL*
contest
,
unwilling
to
encounter
the
dishonour
of
almost
certain
defeat
.
*NL*
For
in
those
days
the
skill
of
each
celebrated
marksman
was
as
well
*NL*
known
for
many
miles
round
him
,
as
the
qualities
of
a
horse
trained
at
*NL*
Newmarket
are
familiar
to
those
who
frequent
that
well-known
meeting
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
diminished
list
of
competitors
for
silvan
fame
still
amounted
to
*NL*
eight
.
Prince
John
stepped
from
his
royal
seat
to
view
more
nearly
the
*NL*
persons
of
these
chosen
yeomen
,
several
of
whom
wore
the
royal
livery
.
*NL*
Having
satisfied
his
curiosity
by
this
investigation
,
he
looked
for
the
*NL*
object
of
his
resentment
,
whom
he
observed
standing
on
the
same
spot
,
*NL*
and
with
the
same
composed
countenance
which
he
had
exhibited
upon
the
*NL*
preceding
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fellow
,
''
said
Prince
John
,
``
I
guessed
by
thy
insolent
babble
that
thou
*NL*
wert
no
true
lover
of
the
longbow
,
and
I
see
thou
darest
not
adventure
*NL*
thy
skill
among
such
merry-men
as
stand
yonder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Under
favour
,
sir
,
''
replied
the
yeoman
,
``
I
have
another
reason
for
*NL*
refraining
to
shoot
,
besides
the
fearing
discomfiture
and
disgrace
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
is
thy
other
reason
?
''
said
Prince
John
,
who
,
for
some
cause
*NL*
which
perhaps
he
could
not
himself
have
explained
,
felt
a
painful
*NL*
curiosity
respecting
this
individual
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
,
''
replied
the
woodsman
,
``
I
know
not
if
these
yeomen
and
I
are
*NL*
used
to
shoot
at
the
same
marks
;
and
because
,
moreover
,
I
know
not
how
*NL*
your
Grace
might
relish
the
winning
of
a
third
prize
by
one
who
has
*NL*
unwittingly
fallen
under
your
displeasure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
John
coloured
as
he
put
the
question
,
``
What
is
thy
name
,
yeoman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Locksley
,
''
answered
the
yeoman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
Locksley
,
''
said
Prince
John
,
``
thou
shalt
shoot
in
thy
turn
,
when
*NL*
these
yeomen
have
displayed
their
skill
.
If
thou
carriest
the
prize
,
*NL*
I
will
add
to
it
twenty
nobles
;
but
if
thou
losest
it
,
thou
shalt
*NL*
be
stript
of
thy
Lincoln
green
,
and
scourged
out
of
the
lists
with
*NL*
bowstrings
,
for
a
wordy
and
insolent
braggart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
if
I
refuse
to
shoot
on
such
a
wager
?
''
said
the
yeoman
.
--
``
Your
*NL*
Grace
's
power
,
supported
,
as
it
is
,
by
so
many
men-at-arms
,
may
indeed
*NL*
easily
strip
and
scourge
me
,
but
can
not
compel
me
to
bend
or
to
draw
my
*NL*
bow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
thou
refusest
my
fair
proffer
,
''
said
the
Prince
,
``
the
Provost
of
the
*NL*
lists
shall
cut
thy
bowstring
,
break
thy
bow
and
arrows
,
and
expel
thee
*NL*
from
the
presence
as
a
faint-hearted
craven
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
no
fair
chance
you
put
on
me
,
proud
Prince
,
''
said
the
yeoman
,
*NL*
``
to
compel
me
to
peril
myself
against
the
best
archers
of
Leicester
And
*NL*
Staffordshire
,
under
the
penalty
of
infamy
if
they
should
overshoot
me
.
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
I
will
obey
your
pleasure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
to
him
close
,
men-at-arms
,
''
said
Prince
John
,
``
his
heart
is
*NL*
sinking
;
I
am
jealous
lest
he
attempt
to
escape
the
trial
.
--
And
do
you
,
*NL*
good
fellows
,
shoot
boldly
round
;
a
buck
and
a
butt
of
wine
are
ready
*NL*
for
your
refreshment
in
yonder
tent
,
when
the
prize
is
won
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
target
was
placed
at
the
upper
end
of
the
southern
avenue
which
led
*NL*
to
the
lists
.
The
contending
archers
took
their
station
in
turn
,
at
the
*NL*
bottom
of
the
southern
access
,
the
distance
between
that
station
and
the
*NL*
mark
allowing
full
distance
for
what
was
called
a
shot
at
rovers
.
The
*NL*
archers
,
having
previously
determined
by
lot
their
order
of
precedence
,
*NL*
were
to
shoot
each
three
shafts
in
succession
.
The
sports
were
regulated
*NL*
by
an
officer
of
inferior
rank
,
termed
the
Provost
of
the
Games
;
for
the
*NL*
high
rank
of
the
marshals
of
the
lists
would
have
been
held
degraded
,
*NL*
had
they
condescended
to
superintend
the
sports
of
the
yeomanry
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
by
one
the
archers
,
stepping
forward
,
delivered
their
shafts
*NL*
yeomanlike
and
bravely
.
Of
twenty-four
arrows
,
shot
in
succession
,
*NL*
ten
were
fixed
in
the
target
,
and
the
others
ranged
so
near
it
,
that
,
*NL*
considering
the
distance
of
the
mark
,
it
was
accounted
good
archery
.
Of
*NL*
the
ten
shafts
which
hit
the
target
,
two
within
the
inner
ring
were
shot
*NL*
by
Hubert
,
a
forester
in
the
service
of
Malvoisin
,
who
was
accordingly
*NL*
pronounced
victorious
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Locksley
,
''
said
Prince
John
to
the
bold
yeoman
,
with
a
bitter
*NL*
smile
,
``
wilt
thou
try
conclusions
with
Hubert
,
or
wilt
thou
yield
up
*NL*
bow
,
baldric
,
and
quiver
,
to
the
Provost
of
the
sports
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sith
it
be
no
better
,
''
said
Locksley
,
``
I
am
content
to
try
my
fortune
;
*NL*
on
condition
that
when
I
have
shot
two
shafts
at
yonder
mark
of
*NL*
Hubert
's
,
he
shall
be
bound
to
shoot
one
at
that
which
I
shall
propose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
but
fair
,
''
answered
Prince
John
,
``
and
it
shall
not
be
refused
*NL*
thee
.
--
If
thou
dost
beat
this
braggart
,
Hubert
,
I
will
fill
the
bugle
*NL*
with
silver-pennies
for
thee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
man
can
do
but
his
best
,
''
answered
Hubert
;
``
but
my
grandsire
drew
a
*NL*
good
long
bow
at
Hastings
,
and
I
trust
not
to
dishonour
his
memory
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
former
target
was
now
removed
,
and
a
fresh
one
of
the
same
size
*NL*
placed
in
its
room
.
Hubert
,
who
,
as
victor
in
the
first
trial
of
skill
,
*NL*
had
the
right
to
shoot
first
,
took
his
aim
with
great
deliberation
,
*NL*
long
measuring
the
distance
with
his
eye
,
while
he
held
in
his
hand
his
*NL*
bended
bow
,
with
the
arrow
placed
on
the
string
.
At
length
he
made
a
*NL*
step
forward
,
and
raising
the
bow
at
the
full
stretch
of
his
left
arm
,
*NL*
till
the
centre
or
grasping-place
was
nigh
level
with
his
face
,
he
*NL*
drew
his
bowstring
to
his
ear
.
The
arrow
whistled
through
the
air
,
and
*NL*
lighted
within
the
inner
ring
of
the
target
,
but
not
exactly
in
the
*NL*
centre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
not
allowed
for
the
wind
,
Hubert
,
''
said
his
antagonist
,
*NL*
bending
his
bow
,
``
or
that
had
been
a
better
shot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
and
without
showing
the
least
anxiety
to
pause
upon
his
*NL*
aim
,
Locksley
stept
to
the
appointed
station
,
and
shot
his
arrow
as
*NL*
carelessly
in
appearance
as
if
he
had
not
even
looked
at
the
mark
.
He
*NL*
was
speaking
almost
at
the
instant
that
the
shaft
left
the
bowstring
,
*NL*
yet
it
alighted
in
the
target
two
inches
nearer
to
the
white
spot
which
*NL*
marked
the
centre
than
that
of
Hubert
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
light
of
heaven
!
''
said
Prince
John
to
Hubert
,
``
an
thou
suffer
*NL*
that
runagate
knave
to
overcome
thee
,
thou
art
worthy
of
the
gallows
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hubert
had
but
one
set
speech
for
all
occasions
.
``
An
your
highness
*NL*
were
to
hang
me
,
''
he
said
,
``
a
man
can
but
do
his
best
.
Nevertheless
,
my
*NL*
grandsire
drew
a
good
bow
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
foul
fiend
on
thy
grandsire
and
all
his
generation
!
''
interrupted
*NL*
John
,
``
shoot
,
knave
,
and
shoot
thy
best
,
or
it
shall
be
the
worse
for
*NL*
thee
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
exhorted
,
Hubert
resumed
his
place
,
and
not
neglecting
the
*NL*
caution
which
he
had
received
from
his
adversary
,
he
made
the
necessary
*NL*
allowance
for
a
very
light
air
of
wind
,
which
had
just
arisen
,
and
*NL*
shot
so
successfully
that
his
arrow
alighted
in
the
very
centre
of
the
*NL*
target
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
Hubert
!
a
Hubert
!
''
shouted
the
populace
,
more
interested
in
a
known
*NL*
person
than
in
a
stranger
.
``
In
the
clout
!
--
in
the
clout
!
--
a
Hubert
for
*NL*
ever
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
canst
not
mend
that
shot
,
Locksley
,
''
said
the
Prince
,
with
an
*NL*
insulting
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
notch
his
shaft
for
him
,
however
,
''
replied
Locksley
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
letting
fly
his
arrow
with
a
little
more
precaution
than
before
,
it
*NL*
lighted
right
upon
that
of
his
competitor
,
which
it
split
to
shivers
.
*NL*
The
people
who
stood
around
were
so
astonished
at
his
wonderful
*NL*
dexterity
,
that
they
could
not
even
give
vent
to
their
surprise
in
their
*NL*
usual
clamour
.
``
This
must
be
the
devil
,
and
no
man
of
flesh
and
blood
,
''
*NL*
whispered
the
yeomen
to
each
other
;
``
such
archery
was
never
seen
since
a
*NL*
bow
was
first
bent
in
Britain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
''
said
Locksley
,
``
I
will
crave
your
Grace
's
permission
to
plant
*NL*
such
a
mark
as
is
used
in
the
North
Country
;
and
welcome
every
brave
*NL*
yeoman
who
shall
try
a
shot
at
it
to
win
a
smile
from
the
bonny
lass
he
*NL*
loves
best
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
then
turned
to
leave
the
lists
.
``
Let
your
guards
attend
me
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
``
if
you
please
--
I
go
but
to
cut
a
rod
from
the
next
willow-bush
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
John
made
a
signal
that
some
attendants
should
follow
him
in
*NL*
case
of
his
escape
:
but
the
cry
of
``
Shame
!
shame
!
''
which
burst
from
the
*NL*
multitude
,
induced
him
to
alter
his
ungenerous
purpose
.
*NL*
*NL*
Locksley
returned
almost
instantly
with
a
willow
wand
about
six
feet
in
*NL*
length
,
perfectly
straight
,
and
rather
thicker
than
a
man
's
thumb
.
He
*NL*
began
to
peel
this
with
great
composure
,
observing
at
the
same
time
,
*NL*
that
to
ask
a
good
woodsman
to
shoot
at
a
target
so
broad
as
had
*NL*
hitherto
been
used
,
was
to
put
shame
upon
his
skill
.
``
For
his
own
part
,
''
*NL*
he
said
,
``
and
in
the
land
where
he
was
bred
,
men
would
as
soon
take
for
*NL*
their
mark
King
Arthur
's
round-table
,
which
held
sixty
knights
around
*NL*
it
.
A
child
of
seven
years
old
,
''
he
said
,
``
might
hit
yonder
target
with
*NL*
a
headless
shaft
;
but
,
''
added
he
,
walking
deliberately
to
the
other
end
*NL*
of
the
lists
,
and
sticking
the
willow
wand
upright
in
the
ground
,
``
he
*NL*
that
hits
that
rod
at
five-score
yards
,
I
call
him
an
archer
fit
to
bear
*NL*
both
bow
and
quiver
before
a
king
,
an
it
were
the
stout
King
Richard
*NL*
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
grandsire
,
''
said
Hubert
,
``
drew
a
good
bow
at
the
battle
of
Hastings
,
*NL*
and
never
shot
at
such
a
mark
in
his
life
--
and
neither
will
I
.
If
this
*NL*
yeoman
can
cleave
that
rod
,
I
give
him
the
bucklers
--
or
rather
,
I
yield
*NL*
to
the
devil
that
is
in
his
jerkin
,
and
not
to
any
human
skill
;
a
man
*NL*
can
but
do
his
best
,
and
I
will
not
shoot
where
I
am
sure
to
miss
.
I
*NL*
might
as
well
shoot
at
the
edge
of
our
parson
's
whittle
,
or
at
a
wheat
*NL*
straw
,
or
at
a
sunbeam
,
as
at
a
twinkling
white
streak
which
I
can
*NL*
hardly
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cowardly
dog
!

said
Prince
John
.
--
``
Sirrah
Locksley
,
do
thou
shoot
;

*NL*
if
thou
hittest
such
a
mark
,
I
will
say
thou
art
the
first
man
ever
*NL*
did
so
.
However
it
be
,
thou
shalt
not
crow
over
us
with
a
mere
show
of
*NL*
superior
skill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
do
my
best
,
as
Hubert
says
,
''
answered
Locksley
;
``
no
man
can
do
*NL*
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
he
again
bent
his
bow
,
but
on
the
present
occasion
looked
*NL*
with
attention
to
his
weapon
,
and
changed
the
string
,
which
he
thought
*NL*
was
no
longer
truly
round
,
having
been
a
little
frayed
by
the
two
former
*NL*
shots
.
He
then
took
his
aim
with
some
deliberation
,
and
the
multitude
*NL*
awaited
the
event
in
breathless
silence
.
The
archer
vindicated
their
*NL*
opinion
of
his
skill
:
his
arrow
split
the
willow
rod
against
which
it
*NL*
was
aimed
.
A
jubilee
of
acclamations
followed
;
and
even
Prince
John
,
in
*NL*
admiration
of
Locksley
's
skill
,
lost
for
an
instant
his
dislike
to
his
*NL*
person
.
``
These

''
he
said
,
``
which
,
with
the
bugle
,
thou
*NL*
hast
fairly
won

thine

we
will
make

fifty

if

take

and
service
with
us
as
a
yeoman
of
our
body

and
be
*NL*
near
to
our
person
.
For
never
did
so
strong
a
hand
bend
a
bow
,
or
so
*NL*
true
an
eye
direct
a
shaft
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
me
,
noble
Prince
,
''
said
Locksley
;
``
but
I
have
vowed
,
that
if
*NL*
ever
I
take
service
,
it
should
be
with
your
royal
brother
King
Richard
.
*NL*
These
twenty
nobles
I
leave
to
Hubert
,
who
has
this
day
drawn
as
brave
*NL*
a
bow
as
his
grandsire
did
at
Hastings
.
Had
his
modesty
not
refused
the
*NL*
trial
,
he
would
have
hit
the
wand
as
well
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hubert
shook
his
head
as
he
received
with
reluctance
the
bounty
of
the
*NL*
stranger
,
and
Locksley
,
anxious
to
escape
further
observation
,
mixed
*NL*
with
the
crowd
,
and
was
seen
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
victorious
archer
would
not
perhaps
have
escaped
John
's
attention
*NL*
so
easily
,
had
not
that
Prince
had
other
subjects
of
anxious
and
more
*NL*
important
meditation
pressing
upon
his
mind
at
that
instant
.
He
called
*NL*
upon
his
chamberlain
as
he
gave
the
signal
for
retiring
from
the
lists
,
*NL*
and
commanded
him
instantly
to
gallop
to
Ashby
,
and
seek
out
Isaac
the
*NL*
Jew
.
``
Tell
the
dog
,
''
he
said
,
``
to
send
me
,
before
sun-down
,
two
thousand
*NL*
crowns
.
He
knows
the
security
;
but
thou
mayst
show
him
this
ring
for
a
*NL*
token
.
The
rest
of
the
money
must
be
paid
at
York
within
six
days
.
If
*NL*
he
neglects
,
I
will
have
the
unbelieving
villain
's
head
.
Look
that
thou
*NL*
pass
him
not
on
the
way
;
for
the
circumcised
slave
was
displaying
his
*NL*
stolen
finery
amongst
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
the
Prince
resumed
his
horse
,
and
returned
to
Ashby
,
the
*NL*
whole
crowd
breaking
up
and
dispersing
upon
his
retreat
.

In

*NL*
--
Warton
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
John
held
his
high
festival
in
the
Castle
of
Ashby
.
This
was
*NL*
not
the
same
building
of
which
the
stately
ruins
still
interest
the
*NL*
traveller
,
and
which
was
erected
at
a
later
period
by
the
Lord
Hastings
,
*NL*
High
Chamberlain
of
England
,
one
of
the
first
victims
of
the
tyranny
*NL*
of
Richard
the
Third
,
and
yet
better
known
as
one
of
Shakspeare
's
*NL*
characters
than
by
his
historical
fame
.
The
castle
and
town
of
Ashby
,
at
*NL*
this
time
,
belonged
to
Roger
de
Quincy
,
Earl
of
Winchester
,
who
,
during
*NL*
the
period
of
our
history
,
was
absent
in
the
Holy
Land
.
Prince
John
,
in
*NL*
the
meanwhile
,
occupied
his
castle
,
and
disposed
of
his
domains
without
*NL*
scruple
;
and
seeking
at
present
to
dazzle
men
's
eyes
by
his
hospitality
*NL*
and
magnificence
,
had
given
orders
for
great
preparations
,
in
order
to
*NL*
render
the
banquet
as
splendid
as
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
purveyors
of
the
Prince
,
who
exercised
on
this
and
other
occasions
*NL*
the
full
authority
of
royalty
,
had
swept
the
country
of
all
that
could
*NL*
be
collected
which
was
esteemed
fit
for
their
master
's
table
.
Guests
*NL*
also
were
invited
in
great
numbers
;
and
in
the
necessity
in
which
he
*NL*
then
found
himself
of
courting
popularity
,
Prince
John
had
extended
his
*NL*
invitation
to
a
few
distinguished
Saxon
and
Danish
families
,
as
well
as
*NL*
to
the
Norman
nobility
and
gentry
of
the
neighbourhood
.
However
*NL*
despised
and
degraded
on
ordinary
occasions
,
the
great
numbers
of
*NL*
the
Anglo-Saxons
must
necessarily
render
them
formidable
in
the
civil
*NL*
commotions
which
seemed
approaching
,
and
it
was
an
obvious
point
of
*NL*
policy
to
secure
popularity
with
their
leaders
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
accordingly
the
Prince
's
intention
,
which
he
for
some
time
*NL*
maintained
,
to
treat
these
unwonted
guests
with
a
courtesy
to
which
they
*NL*
had
been
little
accustomed
.
But
although
no
man
with
less
scruple
*NL*
made
his
ordinary
habits
and
feelings
bend
to
his
interest
,
it
was
*NL*
the
misfortune
of
this
Prince
,
that
his
levity
and
petulance
were
*NL*
perpetually
breaking
out
,
and
undoing
all
that
had
been
gained
by
his
*NL*
previous
dissimulation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
this
fickle
temper
he
gave
a
memorable
example
in
Ireland
,
when
sent
*NL*
thither
by
his
father
,
Henry
the
Second
,
with
the
purpose
of
buying
*NL*
golden
opinions
of
the
inhabitants
of
that
new
and
important
acquisition
*NL*
to
the
English
crown
.
Upon
this
occasion
the
Irish
chieftains
contended
*NL*
which
should
first
offer
to
the
young
Prince
their
loyal
homage
and
*NL*
the
kiss
of
peace
.
But
,
instead
of
receiving
their
salutations
with
*NL*
courtesy
,
John
and
his
petulant
attendants
could
not
resist
the
*NL*
temptation
of
pulling
the
long
beards
of
the
Irish
chieftains
;
a
*NL*
conduct
which
,
as
might
have
been
expected
,
was
highly
resented
by
these
*NL*
insulted
dignitaries
,
and
produced
fatal
consequences
to
the
English
*NL*
domination
in
Ireland
.
It
is
necessary
to
keep
these
inconsistencies
*NL*
of
John
's
character
in
view
,
that
the
reader
may
understand
his
conduct
*NL*
during
the
present
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
execution
of
the
resolution
which
he
had
formed
during
his
cooler
*NL*
moments
,
Prince
John
received
Cedric
and
Athelstane
with
distinguished
*NL*
courtesy
,
and
expressed
his
disappointment
,
without
resentment
,
when
the
*NL*
indisposition
of
Rowena
was
alleged
by
the
former
as
a
reason
for
her
*NL*
not
attending
upon
his
gracious
summons
.
Cedric
and
Athelstane
were
both
*NL*
dressed
in
the
ancient
Saxon
garb
,
which
,
although
not
unhandsome
in
*NL*
itself
,
and
in
the
present
instance
composed
of
costly
materials
,
was
*NL*
so
remote
in
shape
and
appearance
from
that
of
the
other
guests
,
that
*NL*
Prince
John
took
great
credit
to
himself
with
Waldemar
Fitzurse
for
*NL*
refraining
from
laughter
at
a
sight
which
the
fashion
of
the
day
*NL*
rendered
ridiculous
.
Yet
,
in
the
eye
of
sober
judgment
,
the
short
close
*NL*
tunic
and
long
mantle
of
the
Saxons
was
a
more
graceful
,
as
well
as
a
*NL*
more
convenient
dress
,
than
the
garb
of
the
Normans
,
whose
under
garment
*NL*
was
a
long
doublet
,
so
loose
as
to
resemble
a
shirt
or
waggoner
's
frock
,
*NL*
covered
by
a
cloak
of
scanty
dimensions
,
neither
fit
to
defend
the
*NL*
wearer
from
cold
or
from
rain
,
and
the
only
purpose
of
which
appeared
*NL*
to
be
to
display
as
much
fur
,
embroidery
,
and
jewellery
work
,
as
the
*NL*
ingenuity
of
the
tailor
could
contrive
to
lay
upon
it
.
The
Emperor
*NL*
Charlemagne
,
in
whose
reign
they
were
first
introduced
,
seems
to
have
*NL*
been
very
sensible
of
the
inconveniences
arising
from
the
fashion
of
*NL*
this
garment
.
``
In
Heaven
's
name
,
''
said
he
,
``
to
what
purpose
serve
these
*NL*
abridged
cloaks
?
If
we
are
in
bed
they
are
no
cover
,
on
horseback
they
*NL*
are
no
protection
from
the
wind
and
rain
,
and
when
seated
,
they
do
not
*NL*
guard
our
legs
from
the
damp
or
the
frost
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
spite
of
this
imperial
objurgation
,
the
short
cloaks
*NL*
continued
in
fashion
down
to
the
time
of
which
we
treat
,
and
*NL*
particularly
among
the
princes
of
the
House
of
Anjou
.
They
were
*NL*
therefore
in
universal
use
among
Prince
John
's
courtiers
;
and
the
*NL*
long
mantle
,
which
formed
the
upper
garment
of
the
Saxons
,
was
held
in
*NL*
proportional
derision
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
guests
were
seated
at
a
table
which
groaned
under
the
quantity
of
*NL*
good
cheer
.
The
numerous
cooks
who
attended
on
the
Prince
's
progress
,
*NL*
having
exerted
all
their
art
in
varying
the
forms
in
which
the
ordinary
*NL*
provisions
were
served
up
,
had
succeeded
almost
as
well
as
the
modern
*NL*
professors
of
the
culinary
art
in
rendering
them
perfectly
unlike
their
*NL*
natural
appearance
.
Besides
these
dishes
of
domestic
origin
,
there
were
*NL*
various
delicacies
brought
from
foreign
parts
,
and
a
quantity
of
rich
*NL*
pastry
,
as
well
as
of
the
simnel-bread
and
wastle
cakes
,
which
were
only
*NL*
used
at
the
tables
of
the
highest
nobility
.
The
banquet
was
crowned
with
*NL*
the
richest
wines
,
both
foreign
and
domestic
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
though
luxurious
,
the
Norman
nobles
were
not
generally
speaking
*NL*
an
intemperate
race
.
While
indulging
themselves
in
the
pleasures
of
*NL*
the
table
,
they
aimed
at
delicacy
,
but
avoided
excess
,
and
were
apt
to
*NL*
attribute
gluttony
and
drunkenness
to
the
vanquished
Saxons
,
as
vices
*NL*
peculiar
to
their
inferior
station
.
Prince
John
,
indeed
,
and
those
who
*NL*
courted
his
pleasure
by
imitating
his
foibles
,
were
apt
to
indulge
to
*NL*
excess
in
the
pleasures
of
the
trencher
and
the
goblet
;
and
indeed
it
is
*NL*
well
known
that
his
death
was
occasioned
by
a
surfeit
upon
peaches
and
*NL*
new
ale
.
His
conduct
,
however
,
was
an
exception
to
the
general
manners
*NL*
of
his
countrymen
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
sly
gravity
,
interrupted
only
by
private
signs
to
each
other
,
the
*NL*
Norman
knights
and
nobles
beheld
the
ruder
demeanour
of
Athelstane
*NL*
and
Cedric
at
a
banquet
,
to
the
form
and
fashion
of
which
they
were
*NL*
unaccustomed
.
And
while
their
manners
were
thus
the
subject
of
sarcastic
*NL*
observation
,
the
untaught
Saxons
unwittingly
transgressed
several
of
the
*NL*
arbitrary
rules
established
for
the
regulation
of
society
.
Now
,
it
is
*NL*
well
known
,
that
a
man
may
with
more
impunity
be
guilty
of
an
actual
*NL*
breach
either
of
real
good
breeding
or
of
good
morals
,
than
appear
*NL*
ignorant
of
the
most
minute
point
of
fashionable
etiquette
.
Thus
Cedric
,
*NL*
who
dried
his
hands
with
a
towel
,
instead
of
suffering
the
moisture
to
*NL*
exhale
by
waving
them
gracefully
in
the
air
,
incurred
more
ridicule
than
*NL*
his
companion
Athelstane
,
when
he
swallowed
to
his
own
single
share
*NL*
the
whole
of
a
large
pasty
composed
of
the
most
exquisite
foreign
*NL*
delicacies
,
and
termed
at
that
time
a
``
Karum-Pie
''
.
When
,
however
,
it
*NL*
was
discovered
,
by
a
serious
cross-examination
,
that
the
Thane
of
*NL*
Coningsburgh
-LRB-
or
Franklin
,
as
the
Normans
termed
him
-RRB-
had
no
idea
*NL*
what
he
had
been
devouring
,
and
that
he
had
taken
the
contents
of
the
*NL*
Karum-pie
for
larks
and
pigeons
,
whereas
they
were
in
fact
beccaficoes
*NL*
and
nightingales
,
his
ignorance
brought
him
in
for
an
ample
share
of
the
*NL*
ridicule
which
would
have
been
more
justly
bestowed
on
his
gluttony
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
long
feast
had
at
length
its
end
;
and
,
while
the
goblet
circulated
*NL*
freely
,
men
talked
of
the
feats
of
the
preceding
tournament
,
--
of
*NL*
the
unknown
victor
in
the
archery
games
,
of
the
Black
Knight
,
whose
*NL*
self-denial
had
induced
him
to
withdraw
from
the
honours
he
had
*NL*
won
,
--
and
of
the
gallant
Ivanhoe
,
who
had
so
dearly
bought
the
honours
*NL*
of
the
day
.
The
topics
were
treated
with
military
frankness
,
and
the
*NL*
jest
and
laugh
went
round
the
hall
.
The
brow
of
Prince
John
alone
was
*NL*
overclouded
during
these
discussions
;
some
overpowering
care
seemed
*NL*
agitating
his
mind
,
and
it
was
only
when
he
received
occasional
hints
*NL*
from
his
attendants
,
that
he
seemed
to
take
interest
in
what
was
passing
*NL*
around
him
.
On
such
occasions
he
would
start
up
,
quaff
a
cup
of
wine
*NL*
as
if
to
raise
his
spirits
,
and
then
mingle
in
the
conversation
by
some
*NL*
observation
made
abruptly
or
at
random
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
drink
this
beaker
,
''
said
he
,
``
to
the
health
of
Wilfred
of
Ivanhoe
,
*NL*
champion
of
this
Passage
of
Arms
,
and
grieve
that
his
wound
renders
him
*NL*
absent
from
our
board
--
Let
all
fill
to
the
pledge
,
and
especially
Cedric
*NL*
of
Rotherwood
,
the
worthy
father
of
a
son
so
promising
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
my
lord
,
''
replied
Cedric
,
standing
up
,
and
placing
on
the
table
his
*NL*
untasted
cup
,
``
I
yield
not
the
name
of
son
to
the
disobedient
youth
,
who
*NL*
at
once
despises
my
commands
,
and
relinquishes
the
manners
and
customs
*NL*
of
his
fathers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
impossible
,
''
cried
Prince
John
,
with
well-feigned
astonishment
,
*NL*
``
that
so
gallant
a
knight
should
be
an
unworthy
or
disobedient
son
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
,
my
lord
,
''
answered
Cedric
,
``
so
it
is
with
this
Wilfred
.
He
left
my
*NL*
homely
dwelling
to
mingle
with
the
gay
nobility
of
your
brother
's
court
,
*NL*
where
he
learned
to
do
those
tricks
of
horsemanship
which
you
prize
so
*NL*
highly
.
He
left
it
contrary
to
my
wish
and
command
;
and
in
the
days
*NL*
of
Alfred
that
would
have
been
termed
disobedience
--
ay
,
and
a
crime
*NL*
severely
punishable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
!
''
replied
Prince
John
,
with
a
deep
sigh
of
affected
sympathy
,
*NL*
``
since
your
son
was
a
follower
of
my
unhappy
brother
,
it
need
not
*NL*
be
enquired
where
or
from
whom
he
learned
the
lesson
of
filial
*NL*
disobedience
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
spake
Prince
John
,
wilfully
forgetting
,
that
of
all
the
sons
of
*NL*
Henry
the
Second
,
though
no
one
was
free
from
the
charge
,
he
himself
had
*NL*
been
most
distinguished
for
rebellion
and
ingratitude
to
his
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
,

Cedric

offended
*NL*
at
a
mode
of

which
the
Normans
frequently
expressed
their

habitual
contempt
of
the
English
,

will
do
thee

*NL*
*NL*
Front-de-Boeuf
would
have
replied
,

Prince
John
's
petulance
and

levity
got
the
start
.

*NL*
``

with

the

each
in

followed
their

aimed
a
shaft

the

Saxon
became
inflamed

he
glanced
his

fiercely
from
one

as

the

at

a

At

he
spoke
,
in
a
voice
half
choked
with
passion

,
addressing

himself
to
Prince

as
the
head

of
the
offence

De

laughing
;

Prince

resuming
his

*NL*
refuses

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
cup
went
round
amid
the
well-dissembled
applause
of
the
courtiers
,
*NL*
which
,
however
,
failed
to
make
the
impression
on
the
mind
of
the
Saxon
*NL*
that
had
been
designed
.
He
was
not
naturally
acute
of
perception
,
*NL*
but
those
too
much
undervalued
his
understanding
who
deemed
that
this
*NL*
flattering
compliment
would
obliterate
the
sense
of
the
prior
insult
.
He
*NL*
was
silent
,
however
,
when
the
royal
pledge
again
passed
round
,
``
To
Sir
*NL*
Athelstane

Coningsburgh

*NL*
*NL*
The
knight
made
his
obeisance
,
and
showed
his
sense
of
the
honour
by
*NL*
draining
a
huge
goblet
in
answer
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And

said
Prince
John
,
who
began
to
be
warmed
with
the
wine
*NL*
which
he
had
drank
,
``

done
justice

he
*NL*
continued
,
addressing
Cedric
,
``

we
pray

sully
your

*NL*
*NL*
Fitzurse
arose
while
Prince
John
spoke
,
and
gliding
behind
the
seat
of
*NL*
the
Saxon
,
whispered
to
him
not
to
omit
the
opportunity
of
putting
an
*NL*
end
to
unkindness
betwixt
the
two
races
,
by
naming
Prince
John
.
The
*NL*
Saxon
replied
not
to
this
politic
insinuation
,
but
,
rising
up
,
and
*NL*
filling
his
cup
to
the
brim
,
he
addressed
Prince
John
in
these
words
:
*NL*
``
Your
highness
has
required
that
I
should
name
a
Norman
deserving
to
*NL*
be
remembered
at
our
banquet
.
This
,
perchance
,
is
a
hard
task
,
since
*NL*
it
calls
on
the
slave
to
sing
the
praises
of
the
master
--
upon
the
*NL*
vanquished
,
while
pressed
by
all
the
evils
of
conquest
,
to
sing
the
*NL*
praises
of
the
conqueror
.
Yet
I
will
name
a
Norman
--
the
first
in
arms
*NL*
and
in
place
--
the
best
and
the
noblest
of
his
race
.
And
the
lips
that
*NL*
shall
refuse
to
pledge
me
to
his
well-earned
fame
,
I
term
false
and
*NL*
dishonoured
,
and
will
so
maintain
them
with
my
life
.
--
I
quaff
this
*NL*
goblet
to
the
health
of
Richard
the
Lion-hearted
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
John
,
who
had
expected
that
his
own
name
would
have
closed
*NL*
the
Saxon
's
speech
,
started
when
that
of
his
injured
brother
was
so
*NL*
unexpectedly
introduced
.
He
raised
mechanically
the
wine-cup
to
his
*NL*
lips
,
then
instantly
set
it
down
,
to
view
the
demeanour
of
the
company
*NL*
at
this
unexpected
proposal
,
which
many
of
them
felt
it
as
unsafe
*NL*
to
oppose
as
to
comply
with
.
Some
of
them
,
ancient
and
experienced
*NL*
courtiers
,
closely
imitated
the
example
of
the
Prince
himself
,
raising
*NL*
the
goblet
to
their
lips
,
and
again
replacing
it
before
them
.
There
*NL*
were
many
who
,
with
a
more
generous
feeling
,
exclaimed
,
``
Long
live
King
*NL*
Richard
!
and
may
he
be
speedily
restored
to
us
!
''
And
some
few
,
among
*NL*
whom
were
Front-de-Boeuf
and
the
Templar
,
in
sullen
disdain
suffered
*NL*
their
goblets
to
stand
untasted
before
them
.
But
no
man
ventured
*NL*
directly
to
gainsay
a
pledge
filled
to
the
health
of
the
reigning
*NL*
monarch
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
enjoyed
his
triumph
for
about
a
minute
,
Cedric
said
to
his
*NL*
companion
,
``
Up
,
noble
Athelstane
!
we
have
remained
here
long
enough
,
*NL*
since
we
have
requited
the
hospitable
courtesy
of
Prince
John
's
banquet
.
*NL*
Those
who
wish
to
know
further
of
our
rude
Saxon
manners
must
henceforth
*NL*
seek
us
in
the
homes
of
our
fathers
,
since
we
have
seen
enough
of
royal
*NL*
banquets
,
and
enough
of
Norman
courtesy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
he
arose
and
left
the
banqueting
room
,
followed
by
*NL*
Athelstane
,
and
by
several
other
guests
,
who
,
partaking
of
the
Saxon
*NL*
lineage
,
held
themselves
insulted
by
the
sarcasms
of
Prince
John
and
his
*NL*
courtiers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
bones
of
St
Thomas

said
Prince
John
,
as
they
retreated
,
``

*NL*
Saxon
churls

borne
off

``

said
De

*NL*
``

replied
the
Abbot
;

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
breaking
up

said
the
Prince
in
a
whisper
to
Fitzurse
;
``

fears
anticipate
the
event

*NL*
*NL*
``
Fear
not

Waldemar
;

he
said

``
I

The
other
guests
were
now
fast
dispersing
,
with
the
exception
of
those
*NL*
immediately
attached
to
Prince
John
's
faction
,
and
his
retinue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This

is
the
result

said
the
Prince
,
turning
*NL*
an
angry
countenance
upon
Fitzurse
;
``

mere
sound

*NL*
*NL*
``

replied
his

De

I

said
Prince
John
,
pacing
the
apartment
with

disordered
steps

expressing
himself
with
an
agitation
to
which
the
*NL*
wine
he
had
drank
partly
contributed

``

And
yet
he
thinks
,

ha

--
he
thinks

I
am
the
tool
and
servant
of
his
will
.
*NL*
Well
,
let
it
be
;
through
all
the
maze
of
trouble
*NL*
His
plots
and
base
oppression
must
create
,
*NL*
I
'll
shape
myself
a
way
to
higher
things
,
*NL*
And
who
will
say
't
is
wrong
?
*NL*
--
Basil
,
a
Tragedy
*NL*
*NL*
No
spider
ever
took
more
pains
to
repair
the
shattered
meshes
of
his
*NL*
web
,
than
did
Waldemar
Fitzurse
to
reunite
and
combine
the
scattered
*NL*
members
of
Prince
John
's
cabal
.
Few
of
these
were
attached
to
him
from
*NL*
inclination
,
and
none
from
personal
regard
.
It
was
therefore
necessary
,
*NL*
that
Fitzurse
should
open
to
them
new
prospects
of
advantage
,
and
remind
*NL*
them
of
those
which
they
at
present
enjoyed
.
To
the
young
and
wild
*NL*
nobles
,
he
held
out
the
prospect
of
unpunished
license
and
uncontrolled
*NL*
revelry
;
to
the
ambitious
,
that
of
power
,
and
to
the
covetous
,
that
of
*NL*
increased
wealth
and
extended
domains
.
The
leaders
of
the
mercenaries
*NL*
received
a
donation
in
gold
;
an
argument
the
most
persuasive
to
their
*NL*
minds
,
and
without
which
all
others
would
have
proved
in
vain
.
Promises
*NL*
were
still
more
liberally
distributed
than
money
by
this
active
agent
;
*NL*
and
,
in
fine
,
nothing
was
left
undone
that
could
determine
the
wavering
,
*NL*
or
animate
the
disheartened
.
The
return
of
King
Richard
he
spoke
of
*NL*
as
an
event
altogether
beyond
the
reach
of
probability
;
yet
,
when
*NL*
he
observed
,
from
the
doubtful
looks
and
uncertain
answers
which
he
*NL*
received
,
that
this
was
the
apprehension
by
which
the
minds
of
his
*NL*
accomplices
were
most
haunted
,
he
boldly
treated
that
event
,
should
*NL*
it
really
take
place
,
as
one
which
ought
not
to
alter
their
political
*NL*
calculations
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
Richard
returns
,
''
said
Fitzurse
,
``
he
returns
to
enrich
his
needy
and
*NL*
impoverished
crusaders
at
the
expense
of
those
who
did
not
follow
him
*NL*
to
the
Holy
Land
.
He
returns
to
call
to
a
fearful
reckoning
,
those
who
,
*NL*
during
his
absence
,
have
done
aught
that
can
be
construed
offence
or
*NL*
encroachment
upon
either
the
laws
of
the
land
or
the
privileges
of
*NL*
the
crown
.
He
returns
to
avenge
upon
the
Orders
of
the
Temple
and
the
*NL*
Hospital
,
the
preference
which
they
showed
to
Philip
of
France
during
*NL*
the
wars
in
the
Holy
Land
.
He
returns
,
in
fine
,
to
punish
as
a
rebel
*NL*
every
adherent
of
his
brother
Prince
John
.
Are
ye
afraid
of
his
power
?
''
*NL*
continued
the
artful
confident
of
that
Prince
,
``
we
acknowledge
him
a
*NL*
strong
and
valiant
knight
;
but
these
are
not
the
days
of
King
Arthur
,
*NL*
when
a
champion
could
encounter
an
army
.
If
Richard
indeed
comes
back
,
*NL*
it
must
be
alone
,
--
unfollowed
--
unfriended
.
The
bones
of
his
gallant
army
*NL*
have
whitened
the
sands
of
Palestine
.
The
few
of
his
followers
who
have
*NL*
returned
have
straggled
hither
like
this
Wilfred
of
Ivanhoe
,
beggared
*NL*
and
broken
men
.
--
And
what
talk
ye
of
Richard
's
right
of
birth
?
''
he
*NL*
proceeded
,
in
answer
to
those
who
objected
scruples
on
that
head
.
``
Is
*NL*
Richard
's
title
of
primogeniture
more
decidedly
certain
than
that
of
*NL*
Duke
Robert
of
Normandy
,
the
Conqueror
's
eldest
son
?
And
yet
William
*NL*
the
Red
,
and
Henry
,
his
second
and
third
brothers
,
were
successively
*NL*
preferred
to
him
by
the
voice
of
the
nation
,
Robert
had
every
merit
*NL*
which
can
be
pleaded
for
Richard
;
he
was
a
bold
knight
,
a
good
leader
,
*NL*
generous
to
his
friends
and
to
the
church
,
and
,
to
crown
the
whole
,
a
*NL*
crusader
and
a
conqueror
of
the
Holy
Sepulchre
;
and
yet
he
died
a
blind
*NL*
and
miserable
prisoner
in
the
Castle
of
Cardiff
,
because
he
opposed
*NL*
himself
to
the
will
of
the
people
,
who
chose
that
he
should
not
rule
*NL*
over
them
.
It
is
our
right
,
''
he
said
,
``
to
choose
from
the
blood
royal
*NL*
the
prince
who
is
best
qualified
to
hold
the
supreme
power

that
is
,
''
*NL*
said
he
,
correcting
himself
,
``
him
whose
election
will
best
promote
the
*NL*
interests
of
the
nobility
.
In
personal
qualifications
,
''
he
added
,
``
it
*NL*
was
possible
that
Prince
John
might
be
inferior
to
his
brother
Richard
;
*NL*
but
when
it
was
considered
that
the
latter
returned
with
the
sword
of
*NL*
vengeance
in
his
hand
,
while
the
former
held
out
rewards
,
immunities
,
*NL*
privileges
,
wealth
,
and
honours
,
it
could
not
be
doubted
which
was
the
*NL*
king
whom
in
wisdom
the
nobility
were
called
on
to
support
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
,
and
many
more
arguments
,
some
adapted
to
the
peculiar
*NL*
circumstances
of
those
whom
he
addressed
,
had
the
expected
weight
with
*NL*
the
nobles
of
Prince
John
's
faction
.
Most
of
them
consented
to
attend
*NL*
the
proposed
meeting
at
York
,
for
the
purpose
of
making
general
*NL*
arrangements
for
placing
the
crown
upon
the
head
of
Prince
John
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
late
at
night
,
when
,
worn
out
and
exhausted
with
his
various
*NL*
exertions
,
however
gratified
with
the
result
,
Fitzurse
,
returning
to
*NL*
the
Castle
of
Ashby
,
met
with
De
Bracy
,
who
had
exchanged
his
banqueting
*NL*
garments
for
a
short
green
kirtle
,
with
hose
of
the
same
cloth
and
*NL*
colour
,
a
leathern
cap
or
head-piece
,
a
short
sword
,
a
horn
slung
over
*NL*
his
shoulder
,
a
long
bow
in
his
hand
,
and
a
bundle
of
arrows
stuck
in
*NL*
his
belt
.
Had
Fitzurse
met
this
figure
in
an
outer
apartment
,
he
would
*NL*
have
passed
him
without
notice
,
as
one
of
the
yeomen
of
the
guard
;
but
*NL*
finding
him
in
the
inner
hall
,
he
looked
at
him
with
more
attention
,
and
*NL*
recognised
the
Norman
knight
in
the
dress
of
an
English
yeoman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
mummery
is
this
,
De
Bracy
?
''
said
Fitzurse
,
somewhat
angrily
;
``
is
*NL*
this
a
time
for
Christmas
gambols
and
quaint
maskings
,
when
the
fate
of

Prince
John
,
is
on
the
very
verge
of
decision
?
Why
hast
thou
*NL*
not
been
,
like
me
,
among
these
heartless
cravens
,
whom
the
very
name
*NL*
of
King
Richard
terrifies
,
as
it
is
said
to
do
the
children

the
*NL*
Saracens

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been

echoed
Waldemar
;

monarch

he
is

monarch

to
rise

thrive

Fitzurse
impatiently

*NL*
``

coolly

*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

De

*NL*
the
Minstrel

He
told
how

feud
arose

between

the
rest

how
they
cut
to
pieces
well-nigh
all

swore
by
our
blessed
Lady

that
they
would
not
permit
those

remained
to
marry
in
their
lineage
;

how
they
became
grieved

sent
to
consult
his
holiness
the
Pope
how
they
might
be

absolved

how

by
the
advice
of

the
youth

carried
off
from

superb
tournament

were
there
present

thus
won
them

*NL*

CHAPTER
XVI
*NL*
*NL*
Far
in
a
wild
,
unknown
to
public
view
,
*NL*
From
youth
to
age
a
reverend
hermit
grew
;
*NL*
The
moss
his
bed
,
the
cave
his
humble
cell
,
*NL*
His
food
the
fruits
,
his
drink
the
crystal
well
*NL*
Remote
from
man
,
with
God
he
pass
'd
his
days
,
*NL*
Prayer
all
his
business
--
all
his
pleasure
praise
.
*NL*
--
Parnell
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
can
not
have
forgotten
that
the
event
of
the
tournament
was
*NL*
decided
by
the
exertions
of
an
unknown
knight
,
whom
,
on
account
of
the
*NL*
passive
and
indifferent
conduct
which
he
had
manifested
on
the
former
*NL*
part
of
the
day
,
the
spectators
had
entitled
,
``
Le
Noir
Faineant
''
.
This
*NL*
knight
had
left
the
field
abruptly
when
the
victory
was
achieved
;
and
*NL*
when
he
was
called
upon
to
receive
the
reward
of
his
valour
,
he
was
*NL*
nowhere
to
be
found
.
In
the
meantime
,
while
summoned
by
heralds
and
*NL*
by
trumpets
,
the
knight
was
holding
his
course
northward
,
avoiding
all
*NL*
frequented
paths
,
and
taking
the
shortest
road
through
the
woodlands
.
*NL*
He
paused
for
the
night
at
a
small
hostelry
lying
out
of
the
ordinary
*NL*
route
,
where
,
however
,
he
obtained
from
a
wandering
minstrel
news
of
the
*NL*
event
of
the
tourney
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
next
morning
the
knight
departed
early
,
with
the
intention
*NL*
of
making
a
long
journey
;
the
condition
of
his
horse
,
which
he
had
*NL*
carefully
spared
during
the
preceding
morning
,
being
such
as
enabled
him
*NL*
to
travel
far
without
the
necessity
of
much
repose
.
Yet
his
purpose
was
*NL*
baffled
by
the
devious
paths
through
which
he
rode
,
so
that
when
evening
*NL*
closed
upon
him
,
he
only
found
himself
on
the
frontiers
of
the
*NL*
West
Riding
of
Yorkshire
.
By
this
time
both
horse
and
man
required
*NL*
refreshment
,
and
it
became
necessary
,
moreover
,
to
look
out
for
*NL*
some
place
in
which
they
might
spend
the
night
,
which
was
now
fast
*NL*
approaching
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
place
where
the
traveller
found
himself
seemed
unpropitious
for
*NL*
obtaining
either
shelter
or
refreshment
,
and
he
was
likely
to
be
reduced
*NL*
to
the
usual
expedient
of
knights-errant
,
who
,
on
such
occasions
,
turned
*NL*
their
horses
to
graze
,
and
laid
themselves
down
to
meditate
on
their
*NL*
lady-mistress
,
with
an
oak-tree
for
a
canopy
.
But
the
Black
Knight
*NL*
either
had
no
mistress
to
meditate
upon
,
or
,
being
as
indifferent
*NL*
in
love
as
he
seemed
to
be
in
war
,
was
not
sufficiently
occupied
by
*NL*
passionate
reflections
upon
her
beauty
and
cruelty
,
to
be
able
to
*NL*
parry
the
effects
of
fatigue
and
hunger
,
and
suffer
love
to
act
as
*NL*
a
substitute
for
the
solid
comforts
of
a
bed
and
supper
.
He
felt
*NL*
dissatisfied
,
therefore
,
when
,
looking
around
,
he
found
himself
deeply
*NL*
involved
in
woods
,
through
which
indeed
there
were
many
open
glades
,
*NL*
and
some
paths
,
but
such
as
seemed
only
formed
by
the
numerous
herds
of
*NL*
cattle
which
grazed
in
the
forest
,
or
by
the
animals
of
chase
,
and
the
*NL*
hunters
who
made
prey
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
,
by
which
the
knight
had
chiefly
directed
his
course
,
had
now
*NL*
sunk
behind
the
Derbyshire
hills
on
his
left
,
and
every
effort
which
he
*NL*
might
make
to
pursue
his
journey
was
as
likely
to
lead
him
out
of
his
*NL*
road
as
to
advance
him
on
his
route
.
After
having
in
vain
endeavoured
*NL*
to
select
the
most
beaten
path
,
in
hopes
it
might
lead
to
the
cottage
of
*NL*
some
herdsman
,
or
the
silvan
lodge
of
a
forester
,
and
having
repeatedly
*NL*
found
himself
totally
unable
to
determine
on
a
choice
,
the
knight
*NL*
resolved
to
trust
to
the
sagacity
of
his
horse
;
experience
having
,
*NL*
on
former
occasions
,
made
him
acquainted
with
the
wonderful
talent
*NL*
possessed
by
these
animals
for
extricating
themselves
and
their
riders
*NL*
on
such
emergencies
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
good
steed
,
grievously
fatigued
with
so
long
a
day
's
journey
under
*NL*
a
rider
cased
in
mail
,
had
no
sooner
found
,
by
the
slackened
reins
,
*NL*
that
he
was
abandoned
to
his
own
guidance
,
than
he
seemed
to
assume
new
*NL*
strength
and
spirit
;
and
whereas
,
formerly
he
had
scarce
replied
to
the
*NL*
spur
,
otherwise
than
by
a
groan
,
he
now
,
as
if
proud
of
the
confidence
*NL*
reposed
in
him
,
pricked
up
his
ears
,
and
assumed
,
of
his
own
accord
,
a
*NL*
more
lively
motion
.
The
path
which
the
animal
adopted
rather
turned
off
*NL*
from
the
course
pursued
by
the
knight
during
the
day
;
but
as
the
horse
*NL*
seemed
confident
in
his
choice
,
the
rider
abandoned
himself
to
his
*NL*
discretion
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
justified
by
the
event
;
for
the
footpath
soon
after
appeared
*NL*
a
little
wider
and
more
worn
,
and
the
tinkle
of
a
small
bell
gave
the
*NL*
knight
to
understand
that
he
was
in
the
vicinity
of
some
chapel
or
*NL*
hermitage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Accordingly
,
he
soon
reached
an
open
plat
of
turf
,
on
the
opposite
side
*NL*
of
which
,
a
rock
,
rising
abruptly
from
a
gently
sloping
plain
,
offered
*NL*
its
grey
and
weatherbeaten
front
to
the
traveller
.
Ivy
mantled
its
sides
*NL*
in
some
places
,
and
in
others
oaks
and
holly
bushes
,
whose
roots
found
*NL*
nourishment
in
the
cliffs
of
the
crag
,
waved
over
the
precipices
below
,
*NL*
like
the
plumage
of
the
warrior
over
his
steel
helmet
,
giving
grace
to
*NL*
that
whose
chief
expression
was
terror
.
At
the
bottom
of
the
rock
,
*NL*
and
leaning
,
as
it
were
,
against
it
,
was
constructed
a
rude
hut
,
built
*NL*
chiefly
of
the
trunks
of
trees
felled
in
the
neighbouring
forest
,
and
*NL*
secured
against
the
weather
by
having
its
crevices
stuffed
with
moss
*NL*
mingled
with
clay
.
The
stem
of
a
young
fir-tree
lopped
of
its
branches
,
*NL*
with
a
piece
of
wood
tied
across
near
the
top
,
was
planted
upright
by
*NL*
the
door
,
as
a
rude
emblem
of
the
holy
cross
.
At
a
little
distance
on
*NL*
the
right
hand
,
a
fountain
of
the
purest
water
trickled
out
of
the
*NL*
rock
,
and
was
received
in
a
hollow
stone
,
which
labour
had
formed
into
a
*NL*
rustic
basin
.
Escaping
from
thence
,
the
stream
murmured
down
the
descent
*NL*
by
a
channel
which
its
course
had
long
worn
,
and
so
wandered
through
the
*NL*
little
plain
to
lose
itself
in
the
neighbouring
wood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beside
this
fountain
were
the
ruins
of
a
very
small
chapel
,
of
which
*NL*
the
roof
had
partly
fallen
in
.
The
building
,
when
entire
,
had
never
been
*NL*
above
sixteen
feet
long
by
twelve
feet
in
breadth
,
and
the
roof
,
low
*NL*
in
proportion
,
rested
upon
four
concentric
arches
which
sprung
from
*NL*
the
four
corners
of
the
building
,
each
supported
upon
a
short
and
heavy
*NL*
pillar
.
The
ribs
of
two
of
these
arches
remained
,
though
the
roof
*NL*
had
fallen
down
betwixt
them
;
over
the
others
it
remained
entire
.
The
*NL*
entrance
to
this
ancient
place
of
devotion
was
under
a
very
low
round
*NL*
arch
,
ornamented
by
several
courses
of
that
zig-zag
moulding
,
resembling
*NL*
shark
's
teeth
,
which
appears
so
often
in
the
more
ancient
Saxon
*NL*
architecture
.
A
belfry
rose
above
the
porch
on
four
small
pillars
,
*NL*
within
which
hung
the
green
and
weatherbeaten
bell
,
the
feeble
sounds
of
*NL*
which
had
been
some
time
before
heard
by
the
Black
Knight
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
peaceful
and
quiet
scene
lay
glimmering
in
twilight
before
*NL*
the
eyes
of
the
traveller
,
giving
him
good
assurance
of
lodging
for
the
*NL*
night
;
since
it
was
a
special
duty
of
those
hermits
who
dwelt
in
*NL*
the
woods
,
to
exercise
hospitality
towards
benighted
or
bewildered
*NL*
passengers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Accordingly
,
the
knight
took
no
time
to
consider
minutely
the
*NL*
particulars
which
we
have
detailed
,
but
thanking
Saint
Julian
-LRB-
the
*NL*
patron
of
travellers
-RRB-
who
had
sent
him
good
harbourage
,
he
leaped
from
*NL*
his
horse
and
assailed
the
door
of
the
hermitage
with
the
butt
of
his
*NL*
lance
,
in
order
to
arouse
attention
and
gain
admittance
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
some
time
before
he
obtained
any
answer
,
and
the
reply
,
when
*NL*
made
,
was
unpropitious
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pass
on
,
whosoever
thou
art
,
''
was
the
answer
given
by
a
deep
hoarse
*NL*
voice
from
within
the
hut
,
``
and
disturb
not
the
servant
of
God
and
St
*NL*
Dunstan
in
his
evening
devotions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Worthy
father
,
''
answered
the
knight
,
``
here
is
a
poor
wanderer
*NL*
bewildered
in
these
woods
,
who
gives
thee
the
opportunity
of
exercising
*NL*
thy
charity
and
hospitality
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
brother
,
''
replied
the
inhabitant
of
the
hermitage
,
``
it
has
pleased
*NL*
Our
Lady
and
St
Dunstan
to
destine
me
for
the
object
of
those
virtues
,
*NL*
instead
of
the
exercise
thereof
.
I
have
no
provisions
here
which
even
a
*NL*
dog
would
share
with
me
,
and
a
horse
of
any
tenderness
of
nurture
would
*NL*
despise
my
couch
--
pass
therefore
on
thy
way
,
and
God
speed
thee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
,
''
replied
the
knight
,
``
is
it
possible
for
me
to
find
my
way
*NL*
through
such
a
wood
as
this
,
when
darkness
is
coming
on
?
I
pray
you
,
*NL*
reverend
father
as
you
are
a
Christian
,
to
undo
your
door
,
and
at
least
*NL*
point
out
to
me
my
road
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
pray
you
,
good
Christian
brother
,
''
replied
the
anchorite
,
``
to
*NL*
disturb
me
no
more
.
You
have
already
interrupted
one
`
pater
'
,
two
*NL*
`
aves
'
,
and
a
`
credo
'
,
which
I
,
miserable
sinner
that
I
am
,
should
,
*NL*
according
to
my
vow
,
have
said
before
moonrise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
road
--
the
road
!
''
vociferated
the
knight
,
``
give
me
directions
for
*NL*
the
road
,
if
I
am
to
expect
no
more
from
thee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
road
,
''
replied
the
hermit
,
``
is
easy
to
hit
.
The
path
from
the
wood
*NL*
leads
to
a
morass
,
and
from
thence
to
a
ford
,
which
,
as
the
rains
have
*NL*
abated
,
may
now
be
passable

When
thou
hast
crossed
the
ford
,
thou
*NL*
wilt
take
care
of
thy
footing
up
the
left
bank
,
as
it
is
somewhat
*NL*
precipitous
;
and
the
path
,
which
hangs
over
the
river

has
lately

I
*NL*
learn

-LRB-
for
I
seldom
leave
the
duties
of

sundry
*NL*
places

Thou
wilt
then
keep
straight
forward

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
broken
path
--
a
precipice
--
a
ford
,
and
a
morass
!
''
said
the
knight
*NL*
interrupting
him
,
--
``
Sir
Hermit
,
if
you
were
the
holiest
that
ever
wore
*NL*
beard
or
told
bead
,
you
shall
scarce
prevail
on
me
to
hold
this
road
*NL*
to-night
.
I
tell
thee
,
that
thou
,
who
livest
by
the
charity
of
the
*NL*
country
--
ill
deserved
,
as
I
doubt
it
is
--
hast
no
right
to
refuse
shelter
*NL*
to
the
wayfarer
when
in
distress

Either
open
the
door
quickly
,
or
,
by
*NL*
the
rood
,
I
will
beat
it
down
and
make
entry
for
myself

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Friend
wayfarer
,
''
replied
the
hermit
,
``
be
not
importunate
;
if
thou
*NL*
puttest
me
to
use
the
carnal
weapon
in
mine
own
defence
,
it
will
be
e
`
en
*NL*
the
worse
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
a
distant
noise
of
barking
and
growling
,
which
the
*NL*
traveller
had
for
some
time
heard
,
became
extremely
loud
and
furious
,
*NL*
and
made
the
knight
suppose
that
the
hermit
,
alarmed
by
his
threat
of
*NL*
making
forcible
entry
,
had
called
the
dogs
who
made
this
clamour
to
*NL*
aid
him
in
his
defence
,
out
of
some
inner
recess
in
which
they
had
been
*NL*
kennelled
.
Incensed
at
this
preparation
on
the
hermit
's
part
for
making
*NL*
good
his
inhospitable
purpose
,
the
knight
struck
the
door
so
furiously
*NL*
with
his
foot
,
that
posts
as
well
as
staples
shook
with
violence
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
anchorite
,
not
caring
again
to
expose
his
door
to
a
similar
shock
,
*NL*
now
called
out
aloud
,
``
Patience
,
patience
--
spare
thy
strength
,
good
*NL*
traveller
,
and
I
will
presently
undo
the
door

though
,
it
may
be
,
my
*NL*
doing
so
will
be
little
to
thy
pleasure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
accordingly
was
opened
;
and
the
hermit
,
a
large
,
strong-built
*NL*
man
,
in
his
sackcloth
gown
and
hood
,
girt
with
a
rope
of
rushes
,
stood
*NL*
before
the
knight
.
He
had
in
one
hand
a
lighted
torch
,
or
link
,
and
in
*NL*
the
other
a
baton
of
crab-tree
,
so
thick
and
heavy
,
that
it
might
well
*NL*
be
termed
a
club
.
Two
large
shaggy
dogs
,
half
greyhound
half
mastiff
,
*NL*
stood
ready
to
rush
upon
the
traveller
as
soon
as
the
door
should
be
*NL*
opened
.
But
when
the
torch
glanced
upon
the
lofty
crest
and
golden
spurs
*NL*
of
the
knight
,
who
stood
without
,
the
hermit
,
altering
probably
his
*NL*
original
intentions
,
repressed
the
rage
of
his
auxiliaries
,
and
,
*NL*
changing
his
tone
to
a
sort
of
churlish
courtesy
,
invited
the
knight
*NL*
to
enter
his
hut
,
making
excuse
for
his
unwillingness
to
open
his
lodge
*NL*
after
sunset
,
by
alleging
the
multitude
of
robbers
and
outlaws
who
were
*NL*
abroad
,
and
who
gave
no
honour
to
Our
Lady
or
St
Dunstan
,
nor
to
those
*NL*
holy
men
who
spent
life
in
their
service
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
poverty
of
your
cell
,
good
father
,
''
said
the
knight
,
looking
around
*NL*
him
,
and
seeing
nothing
but
a
bed
of
leaves
,
a
crucifix
rudely
carved
*NL*
in
oak
,
a
missal
,
with
a
rough-hewn
table
and
two
stools
,
and
one
or
two
*NL*
clumsy
articles
of
furniture
--
``
the
poverty
of
your
cell
should
seem
a
*NL*
sufficient
defence
against
any
risk
of
thieves
,
not
to
mention
the
aid
*NL*
of
two
trusty
dogs
,
large
and
strong
enough
,
I
think
,
to
pull
down
a
*NL*
stag
,
and
of
course
,
to
match
with
most
men
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
good
keeper
of
the
forest
,
''
said
the
hermit
,
``
hath
allowed
me
*NL*
the
use
of
these
animals
,
to
protect
my
solitude
until
the
times
shall
*NL*
mend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Having
said
this
,
he
fixed
his
torch
in
a
twisted
branch
of
iron
which
*NL*
served
for
a
candlestick
;
and
,
placing
the
oaken
trivet
before
the
*NL*
embers
of
the
fire
,
which
he
refreshed
with
some
dry
wood
,
he
placed
a
*NL*
stool
upon
one
side
of
the
table
,
and
beckoned
to
the
knight
to
do
the
*NL*
same
upon
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
sat
down
,
and
gazed
with
great
gravity
at
each
other
,
each
thinking
*NL*
in
his
heart
that
he
had
seldom
seen
a
stronger
or
more
athletic
figure
*NL*
than
was
placed
opposite
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Reverend
hermit
,
''
said
the
knight
,
after
looking
long
and
fixedly
at
*NL*
his
host
,
``
were
it
not
to
interrupt
your
devout
meditations
,
I
would
*NL*
pray
to
know
three
things
of
your
holiness
;
first
,
where
I
am
to
put
my
*NL*
horse
?
--
secondly
,
what
I
can
have
for
supper
?
--
thirdly
,
where
I
am
to
*NL*
take
up
my
couch
for
the
night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
reply
to
you
,
''
said
the
hermit
,
``
with
my
finger
,
it
being
*NL*
against
my
rule
to
speak
by
words
where
signs
can
answer
the
purpose
.
''
*NL*
So
saying
,
he
pointed
successively
to
two
corners
of
the
hut
.
``
Your
*NL*
stable
,
''
said
he
,
``
is
there
--
your
bed
there
;
and
,
''
reaching
down
a
*NL*
platter
with
two
handfuls
of
parched
pease
upon
it
from
the
neighbouring
*NL*
shelf
,
and
placing
it
upon
the
table
,
he
added
,
``
your
supper
is
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
knight
shrugged
his
shoulders
,
and
leaving
the
hut
,
brought
in
his
*NL*
horse
,
-LRB-
which
in
the
interim
he
had
fastened
to
a
tree
,
-RRB-
unsaddled
him
*NL*
with
much
attention
,
and
spread
upon
the
steed
's
weary
back
his
own
*NL*
mantle
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hermit
was
apparently
somewhat
moved
to
compassion
by
the
anxiety
as
*NL*
well
as
address
which
the
stranger
displayed
in
tending
his
horse
;
for
,
*NL*
muttering
something
about
provender
left
for
the
keeper
's
palfrey
,
he
*NL*
dragged
out
of
a
recess
a
bundle
of
forage
,
which
he
spread
before
the
*NL*
knight
's
charger
,
and
immediately
afterwards
shook
down
a
quantity
of
*NL*
dried
fern
in
the
corner
which
he
had
assigned
for
the
rider
's
couch
.
*NL*
The
knight
returned
him
thanks
for
his
courtesy
;
and
,
this
duty
done
,
*NL*
both
resumed
their
seats
by
the
table
,
whereon
stood
the
trencher
of
*NL*
pease
placed
between
them
.
The
hermit
,
after
a
long
grace
,
which
had
*NL*
once
been
Latin
,
but
of
which
original
language
few
traces
remained
,
*NL*
excepting
here
and
there
the
long
rolling
termination
of
some
word
or
*NL*
phrase
,
set
example
to
his
guest
,
by
modestly
putting
into
a
very
large
*NL*
mouth
,
furnished
with
teeth
which
might
have
ranked
with
those
of
a
*NL*
boar
both
in
sharpness
and
whiteness
,
some
three
or
four
dried
pease
,
a
*NL*
miserable
grist
as
it
seemed
for
so
large
and
able
a
mill
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
knight
,
in
order
to
follow
so
laudable
an
example
,
laid
aside
his
*NL*
helmet
,
his
corslet
,
and
the
greater
part
of
his
armour
,
and
showed
to
*NL*
the
hermit
a
head
thick-curled
with
yellow
hair
,
high
features
,
blue
*NL*
eyes
,
remarkably
bright
and
sparkling
,
a
mouth
well
formed
,
having
an
*NL*
upper
lip
clothed
with
mustachoes
darker
than
his
hair
,
and
bearing
*NL*
altogether
the
look
of
a
bold
,
daring
,
and
enterprising
man
,
with
which
*NL*
his
strong
form
well
corresponded
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hermit
,
as
if
wishing
to
answer
to
the
confidence
of
his
guest
,
*NL*
threw
back
his
cowl
,
and
showed
a
round
bullet
head
belonging
to
a
man
*NL*
in
the
prime
of
life
.
His
close-shaven
crown
,
surrounded
by
a
circle
*NL*
of
stiff
curled
black
hair
,
had
something
the
appearance
of
a
parish
*NL*
pinfold
begirt
by
its
high
hedge
.
The
features
expressed
nothing
of
*NL*
monastic
austerity
,
or
of
ascetic
privations
;
on
the
contrary
,
it
was
*NL*
a
bold
bluff
countenance
,
with
broad
black
eyebrows
,
a
well-turned
*NL*
forehead
,
and
cheeks
as
round
and
vermilion
as
those
of
a
trumpeter
,
*NL*
from
which
descended
a
long
and
curly
black
beard
.
Such
a
visage
,
*NL*
joined
to
the
brawny
form
of
the
holy
man
,
spoke
rather
of
sirloins
and
*NL*
haunches
,
than
of
pease
and
pulse
.
This
incongruity
did
not
escape
the
*NL*
guest
.
After
he
had
with
great
difficulty
accomplished
the
mastication
*NL*
of
a
mouthful
of
the
dried
pease
,
he
found
it
absolutely
necessary
*NL*
to
request
his
pious
entertainer
to
furnish
him
with
some
liquor
;
who
*NL*
replied
to
his
request
by
placing
before
him
a
large
can
of
the
purest
*NL*
water
from
the
fountain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
from
the
well
of
St
Dunstan
,
''
said
he
,
``
in
which
,
betwixt
sun
and
*NL*
sun
,
he
baptized
five
hundred
heathen
Danes
and
Britons
--
blessed
be
his
*NL*
name
!
''
And
applying
his
black
beard
to
the
pitcher
,
he
took
a
draught
*NL*
much
more
moderate
in
quantity
than
his
encomium
seemed
to
warrant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
to
me
,
reverend
father
,
''
said
the
knight
,
``
that
the
small
*NL*
morsels
which
you
eat
,
together
with
this
holy
,
but
somewhat
thin
*NL*
beverage
,
have
thriven
with
you
marvellously
.
You
appear
a
man
more
*NL*
fit
to
win
the
ram
at
a
wrestling
match
,
or
the
ring
at
a
bout
at
*NL*
quarter-staff
,
or
the
bucklers
at
a
sword-play
,
than
to
linger
out
your
*NL*
time
in
this
desolate
wilderness
,
saying
masses
,
and
living
upon
parched
*NL*
pease
and
cold
water
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
Knight
,
''
answered
the
hermit
,
``
your
thoughts
,
like
those
of
the
*NL*
ignorant
laity
,
are
according
to
the
flesh

It
has
pleased
Our
Lady
and
*NL*
my
patron
saint
to
bless
the
pittance
to
which
I
restrain
myself
,
even
*NL*
as
the
pulse

water
was
blessed
to
the
children
Shadrach
,
Meshech
,
*NL*
and
Abednego
,
who
drank
the
same
rather
than
defile
themselves

the

wine

meats
which
were
appointed
them
by
the
King
of
the
Saracens

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Holy

said
the
knight
,
``
upon
whose
countenance
it
hath
pleased

Heaven
to

such
a
miracle

sinful
layman

name

*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
mayst
call

answered
the
hermit
,
``

Copmanhurst

I

termed

They
add

true

the
*NL*
epithet
holy

but
I
stand
not
upon
that

as
being
unworthy
of
such

addition

now

valiant
knight

may
I
pray
ye
for

*NL*
*NL*
``
Truly

said
the
knight
,
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
hermit
could
scarcely
forbear
from
smiling
at
his
guest
's
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
,
''
said
he
,
``
Sir
Sluggish
Knight
,
that
thou
art
a
man
of
prudence
*NL*
and
of
counsel
;
and
moreover
,
I
see
that
my
poor
monastic
fare
likes
*NL*
thee
not
,
accustomed
,
perhaps
,
as
thou
hast
been
,
to
the
license
of
*NL*
courts
and
of
camps
,
and
the
luxuries
of
cities
;
and
now
I
bethink
me
,
*NL*
Sir
Sluggard
,
that
when
the
charitable
keeper
of
this
forest-walk
left
*NL*
those
dogs
for
my
protection
,
and
also
those
bundles
of
forage
,
he
left
*NL*
me
also
some
food
,
which
,
being
unfit
for
my
use
,
the
very
recollection
*NL*
of
it
had
escaped
me
amid
my
more
weighty
meditations
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dare
be
sworn
he
did
so
,
''
said
the
knight
;
``
I
was
convinced
that

there
was
better
food

*NL*
your
cowl

Your
keeper

ever

jovial
fellow
;
and
none
who
beheld
thy
*NL*
grinders
contending
with
these
pease

and
thy
throat
flooded
with
this
*NL*
ungenial
element

could
see
thee
doomed
to
such
horse-provender
and
*NL*
horse-beverage

-LRB-
pointing
to
the
provisions
upon
the
table
,
-RRB-
``
and
*NL*
refrain
from
mending
thy

Let
us
see
the
keeper
's
bounty
,
*NL*
therefore
,
without
delay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
hermit
cast
a
wistful
look
upon
the
knight
,
in
which
there
was
*NL*
a
sort
of
comic
expression
of
hesitation
,
as
if
uncertain
how
far
he
*NL*
should
act
prudently
in
trusting
his
guest
.
There
was
,
however
,
as
much
*NL*
of
bold
frankness
in
the
knight
's
countenance
as
was
possible
to
be
*NL*
expressed
by
features
.
His
smile
,
too
,
had
something
in
it
irresistibly
*NL*
comic
,
and
gave
an
assurance
of
faith
and
loyalty
,
with
which
his
host
*NL*
could
not
refrain
from
sympathizing
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
exchanging
a
mute
glance
or
two
,
the
hermit
went
to
the
further
*NL*
side
of
the
hut
,
and
opened
a
hutch
,
which
was
concealed
with
great
care
*NL*
and
some
ingenuity
.
Out
of
the
recesses
of
a
dark
closet
,
into
which
*NL*
this
aperture
gave
admittance
,
he
brought
a
large
pasty
,
baked
in
a
*NL*
pewter
platter
of
unusual
dimensions
.
This
mighty
dish
he
placed
before
*NL*
his
guest
,
who
,
using
his
poniard
to
cut
it
open
,
lost
no
time
in
making
*NL*
himself
acquainted
with
its
contents
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
long
is
it
since
the
good
keeper
has
been
here
?
''
said
the
knight
*NL*
to
his
host
,
after
having
swallowed
several
hasty
morsels
of
this
*NL*
reinforcement
to
the
hermit
's
good
cheer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
two
months
,
''
answered
the
father
hastily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
true
Lord
,
''
answered
the
knight
,
``
every
thing
in
your
hermitage
*NL*
is
miraculous
,
Holy
Clerk
!
for
I
would
have
been
sworn
that
the
fat
buck
*NL*
which
furnished
this
venison
had
been
running
on
foot
within
the
week
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
hermit
was
somewhat
discountenanced
by
this
observation
;
and
,
*NL*
moreover
,
he
made
but
a
poor
figure
while
gazing
on
the
diminution
of
*NL*
the
pasty
,
on
which
his
guest
was
making
desperate
inroads
;
a
warfare
*NL*
in
which
his
previous
profession
of
abstinence
left
him
no
pretext
for
*NL*
joining
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
in
Palestine
,
Sir
Clerk
,
''
said
the
knight
,
stopping
short
*NL*
of
a
sudden
,
``
and
I
bethink
me
it
is
a
custom
there
that
every
host
who
*NL*
entertains
a
guest
shall
assure
him
of
the
wholesomeness
of
his
food
,
by
*NL*
partaking
of
it
along
with
him
.
Far
be
it
from
me
to
suspect
so
holy
a
*NL*
man
of
aught
inhospitable
;
nevertheless
I
will
be
highly
bound
to
you
*NL*
would
you
comply
with
this
Eastern
custom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
ease
your
unnecessary
scruples
,
Sir
Knight
,
I
will
for
once
depart
*NL*
from
my
rule
,
''
replied
the
hermit
.
And
as
there
were
no
forks
in
those
*NL*
days
,
his
clutches
were
instantly
in
the
bowels
of
the
pasty
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ice
of
ceremony
being
once
broken
,
it
seemed
matter
of
rivalry
*NL*
between
the
guest
and
the
entertainer
which
should
display
the
best
*NL*
appetite
;
and
although
the
former
had
probably
fasted
longest
,
yet
the
*NL*
hermit
fairly
surpassed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Holy
Clerk
,
''
said
the
knight
,
when
his
hunger
was
appeased
,
``
I
would
*NL*
gage
my
good
horse
yonder
against
a
zecchin
,
that
that
same
honest
*NL*
keeper
to
whom
we
are
obliged
for
the
venison
has
left
thee
a
stoup
of
*NL*
wine
,
or
a
runlet
of
canary
,
or
some
such
trifle
,
by
way
of
ally
to
this
*NL*
noble
pasty
.
This
would
be
a
circumstance
,
doubtless
,
totally
unworthy
*NL*
to
dwell
in
the
memory
of
so
rigid
an
anchorite
;
yet
,
I
think
,
were
you
*NL*
to
search
yonder
crypt
once
more
,
you
would

The
hermit
only
replied
by
a
grin
;
and
returning
to
the
hutch
,
he
*NL*
produced
a
leathern
bottle
,
which
might
contain
about
four
quarts
.
He
*NL*
also
brought
forth
two
large
drinking
cups
,
made
out
of
the
horn
of
*NL*
the
urus
,
and
hooped
with
silver
.
Having
made
this
goodly
provision
*NL*
for
washing
down
the
supper
,
he
seemed
to
think
no
farther
ceremonious
*NL*
scruple
necessary
on
his
part
;
but
filling
both
cups
,
and
saying
,
in
the
*NL*
Saxon
fashion
,
''
`
Waes

he
emptied
his

at

a
draught

answered
the
warrior

did
*NL*
his
host
reason
in
a
similar
brimmer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

said
the
stranger
,
after
the
first
cup
was
thus
swallowed
,
*NL*
``
I
can
not

marvel
that
a

possessed

thine

therewithal
shows
the
talent
of
so
goodly
a

,
*NL*
should
think
of
abiding
by
himself
in

In

you
are
fitter
to
keep

eating
of

than
to

upon
the
charity
of

At

were
I

thou

I
should
find

myself
both
disport
and
plenty
out
of
the
king

There
is
many
a
*NL*
goodly

in

never

*NL*

the

the

I

give

The
knight
pledged
him
,

desired
him
to
name
his

*NL*
*NL*
``

the

*NL*
*NL*
Thus
speaking
,
he
opened
another
hutch
,
and
took
out
from
it
a
couple
*NL*
of
broadswords
and
bucklers
,
such
as
were
used
by
the
yeomanry
of
the
*NL*
period

The
knight
,
who
watched
his
motions
,
observed
that
this
second
*NL*
place
of
concealment
was
furnished
with
two
or
three
good
long-bows
,
a
*NL*
cross-bow
,
a
bundle
of
bolts
for
the
latter
,
and
half-a-dozen
sheaves
of
*NL*
arrows
for
the
former
.
A
harp
,
and
other
matters
of
a
very
uncanonical
*NL*
appearance
,
were
also
visible
when
this
dark
recess
was
opened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
promise
thee

said
he
,
``
I
will
ask

no

an
answer

my
enquiries

a

-LRB-
here
he
stooped
and
took
out
*NL*
the
harp
-RRB-
``
on

more
gladly
prove

at

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope

said
the

,
``
thou

I
do

thee

grievously

Nevertheless

thou
art
my

I

thee
down

then

If

I

love

feel
the

CHAPTER
XVII
*NL*
*NL*
At
eve
,
within
yon
studious
nook
,
*NL*
I
ope
my
brass-embossed
book
,
*NL*
Portray
'd
with
many
a
holy
deed
*NL*
Of

crown
'd
with

*NL*
Then
,
as

waxes
dim
,
*NL*
Chant
,
ere
I
sleep
,
my
measured
hymn
.
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
Who
but
would
cast
his
pomp
away
,
*NL*
To
take
my
staff
and
amice
grey
,
*NL*
And
to
the
world
's
tumultuous
stage
,
*NL*
Prefer
the
peaceful
Hermitage
?
*NL*
--
Warton
*NL*
*NL*
Notwithstanding
the
prescription
of
the
genial
hermit
,
with
which
his
*NL*
guest
willingly
complied
,
he
found
it
no
easy
matter
to
bring
the
harp
*NL*
to
harmony
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Methinks
,
holy
father
,
''
said
he
,
``
the
instrument
wants
one
string
,
and
*NL*
the
rest
have
been
somewhat
misused
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
mark
`
st
thou
that
?
''
replied
the
hermit
;
``
that
shows
thee
a
master
*NL*
of
the
craft
.
Wine
and
wassail
,
''
he
added
,
gravely
casting
up
his
*NL*
eyes
--
``
all
the
fault
of
wine
and
wassail
!
--
I
told
Allan-a-Dale
,
the
*NL*
northern
minstrel
,
that
he
would
damage
the
harp
if
he
touched
it
after
*NL*
the
seventh
cup
,
but
he
would
not
be
controlled
--
Friend
,
I
drink
to
thy
*NL*
successful
performance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
he
took
off
his
cup
with
much
gravity
,
at
the
same
time
*NL*
shaking
his
head
at
the
intemperance
of
the
Scottish
harper
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
knight
in
the
meantime
,
had
brought
the
strings
into
some
order
,
*NL*
and
after
a
short
prelude
,
asked
his
host
whether
he
would
choose
a
*NL*
``
sirvente
''
in
the
language
of
``
oc
''
,
or
a
``
lai
''
in
the
language
of
``
oui
''
,
*NL*
or
a
``
virelai
''
,
or
a
ballad
in
the
vulgar
English
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
A
ballad

the

scorned
the
parings

devil

English
alone
shall
*NL*
be
sung
in
this
cell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
assay
,
then
,
''
said
the
knight
,
``
a
ballad
composed
by
a
Saxon
*NL*
glee-man
,
whom
I
knew
in
Holy
Land
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
speedily
appeared
,
that
if
the
knight
was
not
a
complete
master
of
*NL*
the
minstrel
art
,
his
taste
for
it
had
at
least
been
cultivated
under
*NL*
the
best
instructors
.
Art
had
taught
him
to
soften
the
faults
of
a
voice
*NL*
which
had
little
compass
,
and
was
naturally
rough
rather
than
mellow
,
*NL*
and
,
in
short
,
had
done
all
that
culture
can
do
in
supplying
natural
*NL*
deficiencies
.
His
performance
,
therefore
,
might
have
been
termed
very
*NL*
respectable
by
abler
judges
than
the
hermit
,
especially
as
the
knight
*NL*
threw
into
the
notes
now
a
degree
of
spirit
,
and
now
of
plaintive
*NL*
enthusiasm
,
which
gave
force
and
energy
to
the
verses
which
he
sung

During
this
performance
,
the
hermit
demeaned
himself
much
like
a
*NL*
first-rate
critic
of
the
present
day
at
a
new
opera
.
He
reclined
back
*NL*
upon
his
seat
,
with
his
eyes
half
shut
;
now
,
folding
his
hands
and
*NL*
twisting
his
thumbs
,
he
seemed
absorbed
in
attention
,
and
anon
,
*NL*
balancing
his
expanded
palms
,
he
gently
flourished
them
in
time
to
the
*NL*
music
.
At
one
or
two
favourite
cadences
,
he
threw
in
a
little
assistance
*NL*
of
his
own
,
where
the
knight
's
voice
seemed
unable
to
carry
the
air
*NL*
so
high
as
his
worshipful
taste
approved
.
When
the
song
was
ended
,
the
*NL*
anchorite
emphatically
declared
it
a
good
one
,
and
well
sung
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
think
my
Saxon
countrymen
had
herded
long
enough
*NL*
with
the
Normans
,
to
fall
into
the

their
melancholy
ditties

*NL*
What
took
the
honest
knight
from
home
?
or
what
could
he
expect
but
to
*NL*
find
his
mistress
agreeably
engaged
with
a
rival
on
his
return
,
and
his
*NL*
serenade
,
as
they
call
it
,
as
little
regarded
as
the
caterwauling
of
a

cat
in
the

observing

said
the

he
reached

*NL*
When
Cedric
the
Saxon
saw
his
son
drop
down
senseless
in
the
lists
at
*NL*
Ashby
,
his
first
impulse
was
to
order
him
into
the
custody
and
care
of
*NL*
his
own
attendants
,
but
the
words
choked
in
his
throat
.
He
could
not
*NL*
bring
himself
to
acknowledge
,
in
presence
of
such
an
assembly
,
the
son
*NL*
whom
he
had
renounced
and
disinherited
.
He
ordered
,
however
,
Oswald
to
*NL*
keep
an
eye
upon
him
;
and
directed
that
officer
,
with
two
of
his
serfs
,
*NL*
to
convey
Ivanhoe
to
Ashby
as
soon
as
the
crowd
had
dispersed
.
Oswald
,
*NL*
however
,
was
anticipated
in
this
good
office
.
The
crowd
dispersed
,
*NL*
indeed
,
but
the
knight
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
vain
that
Cedric
's
cupbearer
looked
around
for
his
young
*NL*
master
--
he
saw
the
bloody
spot
on
which
he
had
lately
sunk
down
,
but
*NL*
himself
he
saw
no
longer
;
it
seemed
as
if
the
fairies
had
conveyed
him
*NL*
from
the
spot
.
Perhaps
Oswald
-LRB-
for
the
Saxons
were
very
superstitious
-RRB-
*NL*
might
have
adopted
some
such
hypothesis
,
to
account
for
Ivanhoe
's
*NL*
disappearance
,
had
he
not
suddenly
cast
his
eye
upon
a
person
attired
*NL*
like
a
squire
,
in
whom
he
recognised
the
features
of
his
fellow-servant
*NL*
Gurth
.
Anxious
concerning
his
master
's
fate
,
and
in
despair
at
his
*NL*
sudden
disappearance
,
the
translated
swineherd
was
searching
for
him
*NL*
everywhere
,
and
had
neglected
,
in
doing
so
,
the
concealment
on
which
*NL*
his
own
safety
depended
.
Oswald
deemed
it
his
duty
to
secure
Gurth
,
as
a
*NL*
fugitive
of
whose
fate
his
master
was
to
judge
.
*NL*
*NL*
Renewing
his
enquiries
concerning
the
fate
of
Ivanhoe
,
the
only
*NL*
information
which
the
cupbearer
could
collect
from
the
bystanders
*NL*
was
,
that
the
knight
had
been
raised
with
care
by
certain
well-attired
*NL*
grooms
,
and
placed
in
a
litter
belonging
to
a
lady
among
the
spectators
,
*NL*
which
had
immediately
transported
him
out
of
the
press
.
Oswald
,
on
*NL*
receiving
this
intelligence
,
resolved
to
return
to
his
master
for
*NL*
farther
instructions
,
carrying
along
with
him
Gurth
,
whom
he
considered
*NL*
in
some
sort
as
a
deserter
from
the
service
of
Cedric
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Saxon
had
been
under
very
intense
and
agonizing
apprehensions
*NL*
concerning
his
son
;
for
Nature
had
asserted
her
rights
,
in
spite
of
the
*NL*
patriotic
stoicism
which
laboured
to
disown
her
.
But
no
sooner
was
he
*NL*
informed
that
Ivanhoe
was
in
careful
,
and
probably
in
friendly
hands
,
*NL*
than
the
paternal
anxiety
which
had
been
excited
by
the
dubiety
of
his
*NL*
fate
,
gave
way
anew
to
the
feeling
of
injured
pride
and
resentment
,
at
*NL*
what
he
termed
Wilfred
's
filial
disobedience
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
him
wander
his
way
,
''
said
he
--
``
let
those
leech
his
wounds
for
whose
*NL*
sake
he
encountered
them
.
He
is
fitter
to
do
the
juggling
tricks
of
*NL*
the
Norman
chivalry
than
to
maintain
the
fame
and
honour
of
his
English
*NL*
ancestry
with
the
glaive
and
brown-bill
,
the
good
old
weapons
of
his
*NL*
country
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
to
maintain
the
honour
of
ancestry
,
''
said
Rowena
,
who
was
present
,
*NL*
``
it
is
sufficient
to
be
wise
in
council
and
brave
in
execution
--
to
be
*NL*
boldest
among
the
bold
,
and
gentlest
among
the
gentle

know
no

*NL*
*NL*
``
Be

Prepare

unwonted

as

have
rarely
used

of
Hastings

*NL*
Thither

I
go

it
only
to
show
these
proud
Normans
how
little
*NL*
the
fate

could
defeat

bravest
,
can
affect
a
Saxon

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thither
,

said
Rowena
,
``
do
I
NOT
go

and
I
pray
you
to
beware
,
lest

you
mean

shall
be

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Remain
at
home
,
then
,

answered
Cedric
;
``
thine
is
the
*NL*
hard
heart
,
which
can
sacrifice
the
weal
of
an
oppressed
people
to

*NL*

and
unauthorized
attachment
.
I
seek
the
noble
Athelstane
,
and
with
*NL*
him
attend
the
banquet
of
John
of
Anjou
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
accordingly
to
the
banquet
,
of
which
we
have
already
mentioned
*NL*
the
principal
events
.
Immediately
upon
retiring
from
the
castle
,
the
*NL*
Saxon
thanes
,
with
their
attendants
,
took
horse
;
and
it
was
during
the
*NL*
bustle
which
attended
their
doing
so
,
that
Cedric
,
for
the
first
time
,
*NL*
cast
his
eyes
upon
the
deserter
Gurth
.
The
noble
Saxon
had
returned
from
*NL*
the
banquet
,
as
we
have
seen
,
in
no
very
placid
humour
,
and
wanted
but
a
*NL*
pretext
for
wreaking
his
anger
upon
some
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
gyves
!
''
he
said
,
``
the
gyves
!
--
Oswald
--
Hundibert
!
--
Dogs
and
*NL*
villains
!
--
why
leave
ye
the
knave
unfettered
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Without
daring
to
remonstrate
,
the
companions
of
Gurth
bound
him
with
*NL*
a
halter
,
as
the
readiest
cord
which
occurred
.
He
submitted
to
the
*NL*
operation
without
remonstrance
,
except
that
,
darting
a
reproachful
*NL*
look
at
his
master
,
he
said
,
``
This
comes
of
loving
your
flesh
and
blood
*NL*
better
than
mine
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
horse
,
and
forward
!
''
said
Cedric
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
indeed
full
time
,
''
said
the
noble
Athelstane
;
``
for
,
if
we
*NL*
ride
not

faster
,
the
worthy
Abbot
Waltheoff

preparations

rere-supper

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
travellers
,
however
,
used
such
speed
as
to
reach
the
convent
of
St
*NL*
Withold
's
before
the
apprehended
evil
took
place
.
The
Abbot
,
himself
of
*NL*
ancient
Saxon
descent
,
received
the
noble
Saxons
with
the
profuse
and
*NL*
exuberant
hospitality
of
their
nation
,
wherein
they
indulged
to
a
late
,
*NL*
or
rather
an
early
hour
;
nor
did
they
take
leave
of
their
reverend
host
*NL*
the
next
morning
until
they
had
shared
with
him
a
sumptuous
refection
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
cavalcade
left
the
court
of
the
monastery
,
an
incident
happened
*NL*
somewhat
alarming
to
the
Saxons
,
who
,
of
all
people
of
Europe
,
were
most
*NL*
addicted
to
a
superstitious
observance
of
omens
,
and
to
whose
opinions
*NL*
can
be
traced
most
of
those
notions
upon
such
subjects
,
still
to
be
*NL*
found
among
our
popular
antiquities
.
For
the
Normans
being
a
mixed
race
,
*NL*
and
better
informed
according
to
the
information
of
the
times
,
had
lost
*NL*
most
of
the
superstitious
prejudices
which
their
ancestors
had
brought
*NL*
from
Scandinavia
,
and
piqued
themselves
upon
thinking
freely
on
such
*NL*
topics
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
present
instance
,
the
apprehension
of
impending
evil
was
inspired
*NL*
by
no
less
respectable
a
prophet
than
a
large
lean
black
dog
,
which
,
*NL*
sitting
upright
,
howled
most
piteously
as
the
foremost
riders
left
the
*NL*
gate
,
and
presently
afterwards
,
barking
wildly
,
and
jumping
to
and
fro
,
*NL*
seemed
bent
upon
attaching
itself
to
the
party
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
not
that
music
,
father
Cedric
,
''
said
Athelstane
;
for
by
this
*NL*
title
of
respect
he
was
accustomed
to
address
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
I
either
,
uncle
,
''
said
Wamba
;
``
I
greatly
fear
we
shall
have

pay
*NL*
the
piper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
my
mind
,
''
said
Athelstane
,
upon
whose
memory
the
Abbot
's
good
*NL*
ale
-LRB-
for
Burton
was
already
famous
for
that
genial
liquor
-RRB-
had
made
a
*NL*
favourable
impression
,
--
``
in
my
mind
we
had
better
turn
back
,
and
abide
*NL*
with
the
Abbot
until
the
afternoon
.
It
is
unlucky
to
travel
where
your
*NL*
path
is
crossed
by
a
monk
,
a
hare
,
or
a
howling
dog
,
until
you
have
*NL*
eaten
your
next
meal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Away
!
''
said
Cedric
,
impatiently
;
``
the
day
is
already
too
short
for
*NL*
our
journey
.
For
the
dog
,
I
know
it
to
be
the
cur
of
the
runaway
slave
*NL*
Gurth
,
a
useless
fugitive
like
its
master
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
and
rising
at
the
same
time
in
his
stirrups
,
impatient
at
the
*NL*
interruption
of
his
journey
,
he
launched
his
javelin
at
poor
Fangs
--
for
*NL*
Fangs
it
was
,
who
,
having
traced
his
master
thus
far
upon
his
stolen
*NL*
expedition
,
had
here
lost
him
,
and
was
now
,
in
his
uncouth
way
,
*NL*
rejoicing
at
his
reappearance
.
The
javelin
inflicted
a
wound
upon
the
*NL*
animal
's
shoulder
,
and
narrowly
missed
pinning
him
to
the
earth
;
and
*NL*
Fangs
fled
howling
from
the
presence
of
the
enraged
thane
.
Gurth
's
heart
*NL*
swelled
within
him
;
for
he
felt
this
meditated
slaughter
of
his
faithful
*NL*
adherent
in
a
degree
much
deeper
than
the
harsh
treatment
he
had
himself
*NL*
received
.
Having
in
vain
attempted
to
raise
his
hand
to
his
eyes
,
*NL*
he
said
to
Wamba
,
who
,
seeing
his
master
's
ill
humour
had
prudently
*NL*
retreated
to
the
rear
,
``
I
pray
thee
,
do
me
the
kindness
to
wipe
my
eyes
*NL*
with
the
skirt
of
thy
mantle
;
the
dust
offends
me
,
and
these
bonds
will
*NL*
not
let
me
help
myself
one
way
or
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wamba
did
him
the
service
he
required
,
and
they
rode
side
by
side
for
*NL*
some
time
,
during
which
Gurth
maintained
a
moody
silence
.
At
length
he
*NL*
could
repress
his
feelings
no
longer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Friend
Wamba
,
''
said
he
,
``
of
all
those
who
are
fools
enough
to
serve
*NL*
Cedric
,
thou
alone
hast
dexterity
enough
to
make
thy
folly
acceptable
to
*NL*
him
.
Go
to
him
,
therefore
,
and
tell
him
that
neither
for
love
nor
fear
*NL*
will
Gurth
serve
him
longer
.
He
may
strike
the
head
from
me
--
he
may
*NL*
scourge
me
--
he
may
load
me
with
irons
--
but
henceforth
he
shall
never
*NL*
compel
me
either
to
love
or
to
obey
him
.
Go
to
him
,
then
,
and
tell
him
*NL*
that
Gurth
the
son
of
Beowulph
renounces
his
service
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Assuredly
,
''
said
Wamba
,
``
fool
as
I
am
,
I
shall
not
do
your

Cedric
hath
another

into
his

,
and
thou
*NL*
knowest
he
does
not
always
miss
his
mark
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
care
not
,
''
replied
Gurth
,
``
how
soon
he
makes
a
mark
of
me

Yesterday
*NL*
he
left
Wilfred
,
my
young
master

blood
.
To-day
he
has
striven
to
*NL*
kill
before
my

only
other
living

By
St
Edmund

St
Dunstan

St
Withold
,
St
Edward

*NL*
and
every

saint
in
the
calendar
,
''
-LRB-
for
Cedric
never
swore
*NL*
by
any
that
was
not
of
Saxon
lineage
,
and
all
his
household
had
the
same
*NL*
limited
devotion
,
-RRB-
``
I
will
never
forgive
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
my
thinking
now
,
''
said
the
Jester
,
who
was
frequently
wont
to
act
*NL*
as
peace-maker
in
the
family
,
``
our
master
did
not
propose
to
hurt
Fangs
,
*NL*
but
only
to
affright
him
.
For
,
if
you
observed
,
he
rose
in
his
stirrups
,
*NL*
as
thereby
meaning
to
overcast
the
mark
;
and
so
he
would
have
done
,
*NL*
but
Fangs
happening
to
bound
up
at
the
very
moment
,
received
a
scratch
,
*NL*
which
I
will
be
bound
to
heal
with
a
penny
's
breadth
of
tar
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
thought
so
,
''
said
Gurth
--
``
if
I
could
but
think
so
--
but
no
--
I
saw
*NL*
the
javelin
was
well
aimed
--
I
heard
it
whizz
through
the
air
with
all
*NL*
the
wrathful
malevolence
of
him
who
cast
it
,
and
it
quivered
after
it
*NL*
had
pitched
in
the
ground
,
as
if
with
regret
for
having
missed
its
mark
.
*NL*
By
the
hog
dear
to
St
Anthony
,
I
renounce
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
indignant
swineherd
resumed
his
sullen
silence
,
which
no
efforts
*NL*
of
the
Jester
could
again
induce
him
to
break
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
Cedric
and
Athelstane
,
the
leaders
of
the
troop
,
conversed
*NL*
together
on
the
state
of
the
land
,
on
the
dissensions
of
the
royal
*NL*
family
,
on
the
feuds
and
quarrels
among
the
Norman
nobles
,
and
on
the
*NL*
chance
which
there
was
that
the
oppressed
Saxons
might
be
able
to
*NL*
free
themselves
from
the
yoke
of
the
Normans
,
or
at
least
to
elevate
*NL*
themselves
into
national
consequence
and
independence
,
during
the
civil
*NL*
convulsions
which
were
likely
to
ensue
.
On
this
subject
Cedric
was
all
*NL*
animation
.
The
restoration
of
the
independence
of
his
race
was
the
idol
*NL*
of
his
heart
,
to
which
he
had
willingly
sacrificed
domestic
happiness
*NL*
and
the
interests
of
his
own
son
.
But
,
in
order
to
achieve
this
great
*NL*
revolution
in
favour
of
the
native
English
,
it
was
necessary
that
they
*NL*
should
be
united
among
themselves
,
and
act
under
an
acknowledged
head
.
*NL*
The
necessity
of
choosing
their
chief
from
the
Saxon
blood-royal
was
not
*NL*
only
evident
in
itself
,
but
had
been
made
a
solemn
condition
by
those
*NL*
whom
Cedric
had
intrusted
with
his
secret
plans
and
hopes
.
Athelstane
*NL*
had
this
quality
at
least
;
and
though
he
had
few
mental
accomplishments
*NL*
or
talents
to
recommend
him
as
a
leader
,
he
had
still
a
goodly
person
,
*NL*
was
no
coward
,
had
been
accustomed
to
martial
exercises
,
and
seemed
*NL*
willing
to
defer
to
the
advice
of
counsellors
more
wise
than
himself
.
*NL*
Above
all
,
he
was
known
to
be
liberal
and
hospitable
,
and
believed
to
be
*NL*
good-natured
.
But
whatever
pretensions
Athelstane
had
to
be
considered
*NL*
as
head
of
the
Saxon
confederacy
,
many
of
that
nation
were
disposed
*NL*
to
prefer
to
the
title
of
the
Lady
Rowena
,
who
drew
her
descent
from
*NL*
Alfred
,
and
whose
father
having
been
a
chief
renowned
for
wisdom
,
*NL*
courage
,
and
generosity
,
his
memory
was
highly
honoured
by
his
oppressed
*NL*
countrymen
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
have
been
no
difficult
thing
for
Cedric
,
had
he
been
so
*NL*
disposed
,
to
have
placed
himself
at
the
head
of
a
third
party
,
as
*NL*
formidable
at
least
as
any
of
the
others
.
To
counterbalance
their
royal
*NL*
descent
,
he
had
courage
,
activity
,
energy
,
and
,
above
all
,
that
devoted
*NL*
attachment
to
the
cause
which
had
procured
him
the
epithet
of
The
Saxon
,
*NL*
and
his
birth
was
inferior
to
none
,
excepting
only
that
of
Athelstane
*NL*
and
his
ward
.
These
qualities
,
however
,
were
unalloyed
by
the
slightest
*NL*
shade
of
selfishness
;
and
,
instead
of
dividing
yet
farther
his
weakened
*NL*
nation
by
forming
a
faction
of
his
own
,
it
was
a
leading
part
of
*NL*
Cedric
's
plan
to
extinguish
that
which
already
existed
,
by
promoting
a
*NL*
marriage
betwixt
Rowena
and
Athelstane
.
An
obstacle
occurred
to
this
his
*NL*
favourite
project
,
in
the
mutual
attachment
of
his
ward
and
his
son
and
*NL*
hence
the
original
cause
of
the
banishment
of
Wilfred
from
the
house
of
*NL*
his
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
stern
measure
Cedric
had
adopted
,
in
hopes
that
,
during
Wilfred
's
*NL*
absence
,
Rowena
might
relinquish
her
preference
,
but
in
this
hope
he
was
*NL*
disappointed
;
a
disappointment
which
might
be
attributed
in
part
to
the
*NL*
mode
in
which
his
ward
had
been
educated
.
Cedric
,
to
whom
the
name
of
*NL*
Alfred
was
as
that
of
a
deity
,
had
treated
the
sole
remaining
scion
of
*NL*
that
great
monarch
with
a
degree
of
observance
,
such
as
,
perhaps
,
was
*NL*
in
those
days
scarce
paid
to
an
acknowledged
princess
.
Rowena
's
will
had
*NL*
been
in
almost
all
cases
a
law
to
his
household
;
and
Cedric
himself
,
as
*NL*
if
determined
that
her
sovereignty
should
be
fully
acknowledged
within
*NL*
that
little
circle
at
least
,
seemed
to
take
a
pride
in
acting
as
the
*NL*
first
of
her
subjects
.
Thus
trained
in
the
exercise
not
only
of
free
*NL*
will
,
but
despotic
authority
,
Rowena
was
,
by
her
previous
education
,
*NL*
disposed
both
to
resist
and
to
resent
any
attempt
to
control
her
*NL*
affections
,
or
dispose
of
her
hand
contrary
to
her
inclinations
,
and
to
*NL*
assert
her
independence
in
a
case
in
which
even
those
females
who
have
*NL*
been
trained
up
to
obedience
and
subjection
,
are
not
infrequently
apt
to
*NL*
dispute
the
authority
of
guardians
and
parents
.
The
opinions
which
she
*NL*
felt
strongly
,
she
avowed
boldly
;
and
Cedric
,
who
could
not
free
himself
*NL*
from
his
habitual
deference
to
her
opinions
,
felt
totally
at
a
loss
how
*NL*
to
enforce
his
authority
of
guardian
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
vain
that
he
attempted
to
dazzle
her
with
the
prospect
of
a
*NL*
visionary
throne
.
Rowena
,
who
possessed
strong
sense
,
neither
considered
*NL*
his
plan
as
practicable
,
nor
as
desirable
,
so
far
as
she
was
concerned
,
*NL*
could
it
have
been
achieved
.
Without
attempting
to
conceal
her
avowed
*NL*
preference
of
Wilfred
of
Ivanhoe
,
she
declared
that
,
were
that
favoured
*NL*
knight
out
of
question
,
she
would
rather
take
refuge
in
a
convent
,
than
*NL*
share
a
throne
with
Athelstane
,
whom
,
having
always
despised
,
she
now
*NL*
began
,
on
account
of
the
trouble
she
received
on
his
account
,
thoroughly
*NL*
to
detest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
Cedric
,
whose
opinions
of
women
's
constancy
was
far
from
*NL*
strong
,
persisted
in
using
every
means
in
his
power
to
bring
about
the
*NL*
proposed
match
,
in
which
he
conceived
he
was
rendering
an
important
*NL*
service
to
the
Saxon
cause
.
The
sudden
and
romantic
appearance
of
his
*NL*
son
in
the
lists
at
Ashby
,
he
had
justly
regarded
as
almost
a
death
's
*NL*
blow
to
his
hopes
.
His
paternal
affection
,
it
is
true
,
had
for
an
*NL*
instant
gained
the
victory
over
pride
and
patriotism
;
but
both
had
*NL*
returned
in
full
force
,
and
under
their
joint
operation
,
he
was
now
bent
*NL*
upon
making
a
determined
effort
for
the
union
of
Athelstane
and
Rowena
,
*NL*
together
with
expediting
those
other
measures
which
seemed
necessary
to
*NL*
forward
the
restoration
of
Saxon
independence
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
this
last
subject
,
he
was
now
labouring
with
Athelstane
,
not
without
*NL*
having
reason
,
every
now
and
then
,
to
lament
,
like
Hotspur
,
that
he
*NL*
should
have
moved
such
a
dish
of
skimmed
milk
to
so
honourable
an
*NL*
action
.
Athelstane
,
it
is
true
,
was
vain
enough
,
and
loved
to
have
*NL*
his
ears
tickled
with
tales
of
his
high
descent
,
and
of
his
right
*NL*
by
inheritance
to
homage
and
sovereignty
.
But
his
petty
vanity
was
*NL*
sufficiently
gratified
by
receiving
this
homage
at
the
hands
of
his
*NL*
immediate
attendants
,
and
of
the
Saxons
who
approached
him
.
If
he
had
*NL*
the
courage
to
encounter
danger
,
he
at
least
hated
the
trouble
of
going
*NL*
to
seek
it
;
and
while
he
agreed
in
the
general
principles
laid
down
by
*NL*
Cedric
concerning
the
claim
of
the
Saxons
to
independence
,
and
was
still
*NL*
more
easily
convinced
of
his
own
title
to
reign
over
them
when
that
*NL*
independence
should
be
attained
,
yet
when
the
means
of
asserting
these
*NL*
rights
came
to
be
discussed
,
he
was
still
``
Athelstane
the
Unready
,
''
*NL*
slow
,
irresolute
,
procrastinating
,
and
unenterprising
.
The
warm
and
*NL*
impassioned
exhortations
of
Cedric
had
as
little
effect
upon
his
*NL*
impassive
temper
,
as
red-hot
balls
alighting
in
the
water
,
which
produce
*NL*
a
little
sound
and
smoke
,
and
are
instantly
extinguished
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
,
leaving
this
task
,
which
might
be
compared
to
spurring
a
tired
jade
,
*NL*
or
to
hammering
upon
cold
iron
,
Cedric
fell
back
to
his
ward
Rowena
,
he
*NL*
received
little
more
satisfaction
from
conferring
with
her
.
For
,
as
his
*NL*
presence
interrupted
the
discourse
between
the
lady
and
her
favourite
*NL*
attendant
upon
the
gallantry
and
fate
of
Wilfred
,
Elgitha
failed
not
to
*NL*
revenge
both
her
mistress
and
herself
,
by
recurring
to
the
overthrow
of
*NL*
Athelstane
in
the
lists
,
the
most
disagreeable
subject
which
could
greet
*NL*
the
ears
of
Cedric
.
To
this
sturdy
Saxon
,
therefore
,
the
day
's
journey
*NL*
was
fraught
with
all
manner
of
displeasure
and
discomfort
;
so
that
*NL*
he
more
than
once
internally
cursed
the
tournament
,
and
him
who
had
*NL*
proclaimed
it
,
together
with
his
own
folly
in
ever
thinking
of
going
*NL*
thither
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
noon
,
upon
the
motion
of
Athelstane
,
the
travellers
paused
in
a
*NL*
woodland
shade
by
a
fountain
,
to
repose
their
horses
and
partake
of
some
*NL*
provisions
,
with
which
the
hospitable
Abbot
had
loaded
a
sumpter
mule
.
*NL*
Their
repast
was
a
pretty
long
one
;
and
these
several
interruptions
*NL*
rendered
it
impossible
for
them
to
hope
to
reach
Rotherwood
without
*NL*
travelling
all
night
,
a
conviction
which
induced
them
to
proceed
on
*NL*
their
way
at
a
more
hasty
pace
than
they
had
hitherto
used
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*

CHAPTER
XIX
*NL*
*NL*
A
train
of
armed
men
,
some
noble
dame
*NL*
Escorting
,
-LRB-
so
their
scatter
'd
words
discover
'd
,
*NL*
As
unperceived
I
hung
upon
their
rear
,
-RRB-
*NL*
Are
close
at
hand
,
and
mean
to
pass
the
night
*NL*
Within
the
castle
.
*NL*
--
Orra
,
a
Tragedy
*NL*
*NL*
The
travellers
had
now
reached
the
verge
of
the
wooded
country
,
and
were
*NL*
about
to
plunge
into
its
recesses
,
held
dangerous
at
that
time
from
the
*NL*
number
of
outlaws
whom
oppression
and
poverty
had
driven
to
despair
,
*NL*
and
who
occupied
the
forests
in
such
large
bands
as
could
easily
bid
*NL*
defiance
to
the
feeble
police
of
the
period
.
From
these
rovers
,
however
,
*NL*
notwithstanding
the
lateness
of
the
hour
Cedric
and
Athelstane
accounted
*NL*
themselves
secure
,
as
they
had
in
attendance
ten
servants
,
besides
Wamba
*NL*
and
Gurth
,
whose
aid
could
not
be
counted
upon
,
the
one
being
a
jester
*NL*
and
the
other
a
captive
.
It
may
be
added
,
that
in
travelling
thus
late
*NL*
through
the
forest
,
Cedric
and
Athelstane
relied
on
their
descent
and
*NL*
character
,
as
well
as
their
courage
.
The
outlaws
,
whom
the
severity
of
*NL*
the
forest
laws
had
reduced
to
this
roving
and
desperate
mode
of
life
,
*NL*
were
chiefly
peasants
and
yeomen
of
Saxon
descent
,
and
were
generally
*NL*
supposed
to
respect
the
persons
and
property
of
their
countrymen
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
travellers
journeyed
on
their
way
,
they
were
alarmed
by
repeated
*NL*
cries
for
assistance
;
and
when
they
rode
up
to
the
place
from
whence
*NL*
they
came
,
they
were
surprised
to
find
a
horse-litter
placed
upon
the
*NL*
ground
,
beside
which
sat
a
young
woman
,
richly
dressed
in
the
Jewish
*NL*
fashion
,
while
an
old
man
,
whose
yellow
cap
proclaimed
him
to
belong
*NL*
to
the
same
nation
,
walked
up
and
down
with
gestures
expressive
of
the
*NL*
deepest
despair
,
and
wrung
his
hands
,
as
if
affected
by
some
strange
*NL*
disaster
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
the
enquiries
of
Athelstane
and
Cedric
,
the
old
Jew
could
for
some
*NL*
time
only
answer
by
invoking
the
protection
of
all
the
patriarchs
of
the
*NL*
Old
Testament
successively
against
the
sons
of
Ishmael
,
who
were
coming
*NL*
to
smite
them
,
hip
and
thigh
,
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
.
When
he
began
*NL*
to
come
to
himself
out
of
this
agony
of
terror
,
Isaac
of
York
-LRB-
for
it
*NL*
was
our
old
friend
-RRB-
was
at
length
able
to
explain
,
that
he
had
hired
*NL*
a
body-guard
of
six
men
at
Ashby
,
together
with
mules
for
carrying
the
*NL*
litter
of
a
sick
friend
.
This
party
had
undertaken
to
escort
him
as
*NL*
far
as
Doncaster
.
They
had
come
thus
far
in
safety
;
but
having
received
*NL*
information
from
a
wood-cutter
that
there
was
a
strong
band
of
outlaws
*NL*
lying
in
wait
in
the
woods
before
them
,
Isaac
's
mercenaries
had
not
only
*NL*
taken
flight
,
but
had
carried
off
with
them
the
horses
which
bore
the
*NL*
litter
and
left
the
Jew
and
his
daughter
without
the
means
either
of
*NL*
defence
or
of
retreat
,
to
be
plundered
,
and
probably
murdered
,
by
the
*NL*
banditti
,
who
they
expected
every
moment
would
bring
down
upon
them
.
*NL*
``
Would
it
but
please
your
valours
,
''
added
Isaac
,
in
a
tone
of
deep
*NL*
humiliation
,
``
to
permit
the
poor
Jews
to
travel
under
your
safeguard
,
*NL*
I
swear
by
the
tables
of
our
law
,
that
never
has
favour
been
conferred
*NL*
upon
a
child
of
Israel
since
the
days
of
our
captivity
,
which
shall
be
*NL*
more
gratefully
acknowledged
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dog
of
a
Jew
!
''
said
Athelstane
,
whose
memory
was
of
that
petty
*NL*
kind
which
stores
up
trifles
of
all
kinds
,
but
particularly
trifling
*NL*
offences
,
``
dost
not
remember
how
thou
didst
beard
us
in
the
gallery
at
*NL*
the
tilt-yard
?
Fight
or
flee
,
or
compound
with
the
outlaws
as
thou
dost
*NL*
list
,
ask
neither
aid
nor
company
from
us
;
and
if
they
rob
only
such
*NL*
as
thee
,
who
rob
all
the
world
,
I
,
for
mine
own
share
,
shall
hold
them
*NL*
right
honest
folk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cedric
did
not
assent
to
the
severe
proposal
of
his
companion
.
``
We
shall
*NL*
do
better
,
''
said
he
,
``
to
leave
them
two
of
our
attendants
and
two
horses
*NL*
to
convey
them
back
to
the
next
village
.
It
will
diminish
our
strength
*NL*
but
little
;
and
with
your
good
sword
,
noble
Athelstane
,
and
the
aid
of
*NL*
those
who
remain
,
it
will
be
light
work
for
us
to
face
twenty
of
those
*NL*
runagates
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rowena
,
somewhat
alarmed
by
the
mention
of
outlaws
in
force
,
and
so
*NL*
near
them
,
strongly
seconded
the
proposal
of
her
guardian
.
But
Rebecca
*NL*
suddenly
quitting
her
dejected
posture
,
and
making
her
way
through
the
*NL*
attendants
to
the
palfrey
of
the
Saxon
lady
,
knelt
down
,
and
,
after
the
*NL*
Oriental
fashion
in
addressing
superiors
,
kissed
the
hem
of
Rowena
's
*NL*
garment
.
Then
rising
,
and
throwing
back
her
veil
,
she
implored
her
*NL*
in
the
great
name
of
the
God
whom
they
both
worshipped
,
and
by
that
*NL*
revelation
of
the
Law
upon
Mount
Sinai
,
in
which
they
both
believed
,
*NL*
that
she
would
have
compassion
upon
them
,
and
suffer
them
to
go
forward
*NL*
under
their
safeguard
.
``
It
is
not
for
myself
that
I
pray
this
favour
,
''
*NL*
said
Rebecca
;
``
nor
is
it
even
for
that
poor
old
man
.
I
know
that
to
*NL*
wrong
and
to
spoil
our
nation
is
a
light
fault
,
if
not
a
merit
,
with
the
*NL*
Christians
;
and
what
is
it
to
us
whether
it
be
done
in
the
city
,
in
the
*NL*
desert
,
or
in
the
field
?
But
it
is
in
the
name
of
one
dear
to
many
,
*NL*
and
dear
even
to
you
,
that
I
beseech
you
to
let
this
sick
person
be
*NL*
transported
with
care
and
tenderness
under
your
protection
.
For
,
if
evil
*NL*
chance
him
,
the
last
moment
of
your
life
would
be
embittered
with
regret
*NL*
for
denying
that
which
I
ask
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
noble
and
solemn
air
with
which
Rebecca
made
this
appeal
,
gave
it
*NL*
double
weight
with
the
fair
Saxon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
man
is
old
and
feeble
,
''
she
said
to
her
guardian
,
``
the
maiden
young
*NL*
and
beautiful
,
their
friend
sick
and
in
peril
of
his
life
--
Jews
though
*NL*
they
be
,
we
can
not
as
Christians
leave
them
in
this
extremity
.
Let
them
*NL*
unload
two
of
the
sumpter-mules
,
and
put
the
baggage
behind
two
of
the
*NL*
serfs
.
The
mules
may
transport
the
litter
,
and
we
have
led
horses
for
*NL*
the
old
man
and
his
daughter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cedric
readily
assented
to
what
she
proposed
,
and
Athelstane
only
added
*NL*
the
condition
,
``
that
they
should
travel
in
the
rear
of
the
whole
party
,
*NL*
where
Wamba
,
''
he
said
,
``
might
attend
them
with
his
shield
of
boar
's
*NL*
brawn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
left
my
shield
in
the
tilt-yard
,
''
answered
the
Jester
,
``
as
has
*NL*
been
the
fate
of
many
a
better
knight
than
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Athelstane
coloured
deeply
,
for
such
had
been
his
own
fate
on
the
*NL*
last
day
of
the
tournament
;
while
Rowena
,
who
was
pleased
in
the
same
*NL*
proportion
,
as
if
to
make
amends
for
the
brutal
jest
of
her
unfeeling
*NL*
suitor
,
requested
Rebecca
to
ride
by
her
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
were
not
fit
I
should
do
so
,
''
answered
Rebecca
,
with
proud
humility
,
*NL*
``
where
my
society
might
be
held
a
disgrace
to
my
protectress
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
the
change
of
baggage
was
hastily
achieved
;
for
the
single
*NL*
word
``
outlaws
''
rendered
every
one
sufficiently
alert
,
and
the
approach
*NL*
of
twilight
made
the
sound
yet
more
impressive
.
Amid
the
bustle
,
Gurth
*NL*
was
taken
from
horseback
,
in
the
course
of
which
removal
he
prevailed
*NL*
upon
the
Jester
to
slack
the
cord
with
which
his
arms
were
bound
.
It
was
*NL*
so
negligently
refastened
,
perhaps
intentionally
,
on
the
part
of
Wamba
,
*NL*
that
Gurth
found
no
difficulty
in
freeing
his
arms
altogether
from
*NL*
bondage
,
and
then
,
gliding
into
the
thicket
,
he
made
his
escape
from
the
*NL*
party
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bustle
had
been
considerable
,
and
it
was
some
time
before
Gurth
was
*NL*
missed
;
for
,
as
he
was
to
be
placed
for
the
rest
of
the
journey
behind
*NL*
a
servant
,
every
one
supposed
that
some
other
of
his
companions
had
him
*NL*
under
his
custody
,
and
when
it
began
to
be
whispered
among
them
*NL*
that
Gurth
had
actually
disappeared
,
they
were
under
such
immediate
*NL*
expectation
of
an
attack
from
the
outlaws
,
that
it
was
not
held
*NL*
convenient
to
pay
much
attention
to
the
circumstance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
path
upon
which
the
party
travelled
was
now
so
narrow
,
as
not
to
*NL*
admit
,
with
any
sort
of
convenience
,
above
two
riders
abreast
,
and
began
*NL*
to
descend
into
a
dingle
,
traversed
by
a
brook
whose
banks
were
broken
,
*NL*
swampy
,
and
overgrown
with
dwarf
willows
.
Cedric
and
Athelstane
,
who
*NL*
were
at
the
head
of
their
retinue
,
saw
the
risk
of
being
attacked
at
*NL*
this
pass
;
but
neither
of
them
having
had
much
practice
in
war
,
no
*NL*
better
mode
of
preventing
the
danger
occurred
to
them
than
that
they
*NL*
should
hasten
through
the
defile
as
fast
as
possible
.
Advancing
,
*NL*
therefore
,
without
much
order
,
they
had
just
crossed
the
brook
with
a
*NL*
part
of
their
followers
,
when
they
were
assailed
in
front
,
flank
,
*NL*
and
rear
at
once
,
with
an
impetuosity
to
which
,
in
their
confused
and
*NL*
ill-prepared
condition
,
it
was
impossible
to
offer
effectual
resistance
.
*NL*
The
shout
of
``
A
white
dragon
!
--
a
white
dragon
!
--
Saint
George
for
merry
*NL*
England
!
''
war-cries
adopted
by
the
assailants
,
as
belonging
to
their
*NL*
assumed
character
of
Saxon
outlaws
,
was
heard
on
every
side
,
and
on
*NL*
every
side
enemies
appeared
with
a
rapidity
of
advance
and
attack
which
*NL*
seemed
to
multiply
their
numbers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Both
the
Saxon
chiefs
were
made
prisoners
at
the
same
moment
,
and
each
*NL*
under
circumstances
expressive
of
his
character
.
Cedric
,
the
instant
*NL*
that
an
enemy
appeared
,
launched
at
him
his
remaining
javelin
,
which
,
*NL*
taking
better
effect
than
that
which
he
had
hurled
at
Fangs
,
nailed
the
*NL*
man
against
an
oak-tree
that
happened
to
be
close
behind
him
.
Thus
far
*NL*
successful
,
Cedric
spurred
his
horse
against
a
second
,
drawing
his
sword
*NL*
at
the
same
time
,
and
striking
with
such
inconsiderate
fury
,
that
*NL*
his
weapon
encountered
a
thick
branch
which
hung
over
him
,
and
he
*NL*
was
disarmed
by
the
violence
of
his
own
blow
.
He
was
instantly
made
*NL*
prisoner
,
and
pulled
from
his
horse
by
two
or
three
of
the
banditti
who
*NL*
crowded
around
him
.
Athelstane
shared
his
captivity
,
his
bridle
having
*NL*
been
seized
,
and
he
himself
forcibly
dismounted
,
long
before
he
could
*NL*
draw
his
weapon
,
or
assume
any
posture
of
effectual
defence
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
attendants
,
embarrassed
with
baggage
,
surprised
and
terrified
at
the
*NL*
fate
of
their
masters
,
fell
an
easy
prey
to
the
assailants
;
while
*NL*
the
Lady
Rowena
,
in
the
centre
of
the
cavalcade
,
and
the
Jew
and
his
*NL*
daughter
in
the
rear
,
experienced
the
same
misfortune
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
all
the
train
none
escaped
except
Wamba
,
who
showed
upon
the
*NL*
occasion
much
more
courage
than
those
who
pretended
to
greater
sense
.
He
*NL*
possessed
himself
of
a
sword
belonging
to
one
of
the
domestics
,
who
was
*NL*
just
drawing
it
with
a
tardy
and
irresolute
hand
,
laid
it
about
him
like
*NL*
a
lion
,
drove
back
several
who
approached
him
,
and
made
a
brave
though
*NL*
ineffectual
attempt
to
succour
his
master
.
Finding
himself
overpowered
,
*NL*
the
Jester
at
length
threw
himself
from
his
horse
,
plunged
into
the
*NL*
thicket
,
and
,
favoured
by
the
general
confusion
,
escaped
from
the
scene
*NL*
of
action
.
Yet
the
valiant
Jester
,
as
soon
as
he
found
himself
safe
,
*NL*
hesitated
more
than
once
whether
he
should
not
turn
back
and
share
the
*NL*
captivity
of
a
master
to
whom
he
was
sincerely
attached
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
heard
men
talk
of
the
blessings
of
freedom
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
*NL*
``
but
I
wish
any
wise
man
would
teach
me
what
use
to
make
of
it
now
that
*NL*
I
have
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
pronounced
these
words
aloud
,
a
voice
very
near
him
called
out
in
*NL*
a
low
and
cautious
tone
,
``
Wamba
!
''
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
a
dog
,
which
he
*NL*
recognised
to
be
Fangs
,
jumped
up
and
fawned
upon
him
.
``
Gurth
!
''
answered
*NL*
Wamba
,
with
the
same
caution
,
and
the
swineherd
immediately
stood
before
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
?
''
said
he
eagerly
;
``
what
mean
these
cries
,
and
that
*NL*
clashing
of
swords
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
a
trick
of
the
times
,
''
said
Wamba
;
``
they
are
all
prisoners
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
are
prisoners
?
''
exclaimed
Gurth
,
impatiently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
lord
,
and
my
lady
,
and
Athelstane
,
and
Hundibert
,
and
Oswald
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
name
of
God
!
''
said
Gurth
,
``
how
came
they
prisoners
?
--
and
to
*NL*
whom

*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
master
was
too
ready
to
fight

''
said
the
Jester
;
``
and
Athelstane
*NL*
was
not
ready
enough
,
and
no
other
person
was
ready
at
all
.
And
they
are
*NL*
prisoners
to
green
cassocks
,
and
black
visors
.
And
they
lie
all
tumbled
*NL*
about
on
the
green
,
like
the
crab-apples
that
you
shake
down
to
your
*NL*
swine
.
And
I
would
laugh
at
it
,
''
said
the
honest
Jester
,
``
if
I
could
for
*NL*
weeping
.
''
And
he
shed
tears
of
unfeigned
sorrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gurth
's
countenance
kindled
--
``
Wamba
,
''
he
said
,
``
thou
hast
a
weapon
,
*NL*
and
thy
heart
was
ever
stronger
than
thy
brain
,
--
we
are
only
two
--
but
a
*NL*
sudden
attack
from
men
of
resolution
will
do
much
--
follow
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whither
?
--
and
for
what
purpose
?
''
said
the
Jester
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
rescue
Cedric

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
have
renounced
his
service

now

said
Wamba
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
,
''
said
Gurth
,
``
was
but
while
he
was
fortunate
--
follow
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
Jester
was
about
to
obey
,
a
third
person
suddenly
made
his
*NL*
appearance
,
and
commanded
them
both
to
halt
.
From
his
dress
and
arms
,
*NL*
Wamba
would
have
conjectured
him
to
be
one
of
those
outlaws
who
had
just
*NL*
assailed
his
master
;
but
,
besides
that
he
wore
no
mask
,
the
glittering
*NL*
baldric
across
his
shoulder
,
with
the
rich
bugle-horn
which
it
*NL*
supported
,
as
well
as
the
calm
and
commanding
expression
of
his
voice
*NL*
and
manner
,
made
him
,
notwithstanding
the
twilight
,
recognise
Locksley
*NL*
the
yeoman
,
who
had
been
victorious
,
under
such
disadvantageous
*NL*
circumstances
,
in
the
contest
for
the
prize
of
archery
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
,
''
said
he
,
``
or
who
is
it
that
rifle
,
*NL*
and
ransom
,
and
make
prisoners
,
in
these
forests
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
look
at
their
cassocks
close
by
,
''
said
Wamba
,
``
and
see
whether
*NL*
they
be
thy
children
's
coats
or
no
--
for
they
are
as
like
thine
own
,
as
*NL*
one
green
pea-cod
is
to
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
learn
that
presently
,
''
answered
Locksley
;
``
and
I
charge
ye
,
on
*NL*
peril
of
your
lives
,
not
to
stir
from
the
place
where
ye
stand
,
until
*NL*
I
have
returned

Obey
me
,
and
it
shall
be
the
better
for
you

your

Yet
stay
,
I
must
render
myself
as
like
these
men
as
possible

''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
he
unbuckled
his
baldric
with
the
bugle
,
took
a
feather
from
*NL*
his
cap
,
and
gave
them
to
Wamba
;
then
drew
a
vizard
from
his
pouch
,
*NL*
and
,
repeating
his
charges
to
them
to
stand
fast
,
went
to
execute
his
*NL*
purposes
of
reconnoitring
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
we
stand
fast
,
Gurth
?
''
said
Wamba
;
``
or
shall
we
e
`
en
give
him
*NL*
leg-bail
?
In
my
foolish
mind
,
he
had
all
the
equipage
of
a
thief
too
*NL*
much
in
readiness
,
to
be
himself
a
true
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
him
be
the
devil

''
said
Gurth
,
``
an
he
will
.
We
can
be
no
worse
of
*NL*
waiting
his
return
.
If
he
belong
to
that
party
,
he
must
already
have
*NL*
given
them
the
alarm
,
and
it
will
avail
nothing
either
to
fight
or
fly
.
*NL*
Besides
,
I
have
late
experience
,
that
errant
thieves
are
not
the
worst
*NL*
men
in
the
world
to
have
to
deal
with
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
yeoman
returned
in
the
course
of
a
few
minutes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Friend
Gurth
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
have
mingled
among
yon
men
,
and
have
learnt
*NL*
to
whom
they
belong
,
and
whither
they
are
bound
.
There
is
,
I
think
,
*NL*
no
chance
that
they
will
proceed
to
any
actual
violence
against
their
*NL*
prisoners
.
For
three
men
to
attempt
them
at
this
moment
,
were
little
*NL*
else
than
madness
;
for
they
are
good
men
of
war
,
and
have
,
as
such
,
*NL*
placed
sentinels
to
give
the
alarm
when
any
one
approaches
.
But
I
*NL*
trust
soon
to
gather
such
a
force
,
as
may
act
in
defiance
of
all
their
*NL*
precautions
;
you
are
both
servants
,
and
,
as
I
think
,
faithful
servants
,
*NL*
of
Cedric
the
Saxon
,
the
friend
of
the
rights
of
Englishmen
.
He
shall
*NL*
not
want
English
hands
to
help
him
in
this
extremity
.
Come
then
with
me
,
*NL*
until
I
gather
more
aid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
he
walked
through
the
wood
at
a
great
pace
,
followed
by
the
*NL*
jester
and
the
swineherd
.
It
was
not
consistent
with
Wamba
's
humour
to
*NL*
travel
long
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
,
''
said
he
,
looking
at
the
baldric
and
bugle
which
he
still
*NL*
carried
,
``
that
I
saw
the
arrow
shot
which
won
this
gay
prize
,
and
that
*NL*
not
so
long
since

Christmas
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
,
''
said
Gurth
,
``
could
take
it
on
my
halidome
,
that
I
have
heard
*NL*
the
voice
of
the
good
yeoman
who
won
it
,
by
night
as
well
as
by
day
,
and
*NL*
that
the
moon
is
not
three
days
older
since
I
did
so

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mine

''
replied
the
yeoman
,
``
who

what
I

you
will
have
reason
*NL*
to
think
me
the
best

And
whether

I
am
known

whether
I
can
draw
a

well

better
than
a
cow-keeper

or
whether
it
is
my
pleasure

sunshine

they

*NL*
*NL*
``
Our

Wamba

in

whisper
to

CHAPTER
XX
*NL*
*NL*
When
autumn
nights
were
long
and
drear
,
*NL*
And
forest
walks
were
dark
and
dim
,
*NL*
How
sweetly
on
the
pilgrim
's
ear
*NL*
Was
wont
to
steal
the
hermit
's
hymn
*NL*
*NL*
Devotion
borrows
Music
's
tone
,
*NL*
And
Music
took
Devotion
's
wing
;
*NL*
And
,
like
the
bird
that
hails
the
sun
,
*NL*
They
soar
to
heaven
,
and
soaring
sing
.
*NL*
The
Hermit
of
St
Clement
's
Well
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
after
three
hours
'
good
walking
that
the
servants
of
Cedric
,
with
*NL*
their
mysterious
guide
,
arrived
at
a
small
opening
in
the
forest
,
in
*NL*
the
centre
of
which
grew
an
oak-tree
of
enormous
magnitude
,
throwing
*NL*
its
twisted
branches
in
every
direction
.
Beneath
this
tree
four
or
five
*NL*
yeomen
lay
stretched
on
the
ground
,
while
another
,
as
sentinel
,
walked
*NL*
to
and
fro
in
the
moonlight
shade
.
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
hearing
the
sound
of
feet
approaching
,
the
watch
instantly
gave
the
*NL*
alarm
,
and
the
sleepers
as
suddenly
started
up
and
bent
their
bows
.
Six
*NL*
arrows
placed
on
the
string
were
pointed
towards
the
quarter
from
which
*NL*
the
travellers
approached
,
when
their
guide
,
being
recognised
,
was
*NL*
welcomed
with
every
token
of
respect
and
attachment
,
and
all
signs
and
*NL*
fears
of
a
rough
reception
at
once
subsided
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
the
Miller
?
''
was
his
first
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
road
towards
Rotherham
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
how
many
?
''
demanded
the
leader
,
for
such
he
seemed
to
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
six
men
,
and
good
hope
of
booty
,
if
it
please
St
Nicholas
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Devoutly
spoken
,
''
said
Locksley
;
``
and
where
is
Allan-a-Dale
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Walked
up
towards
the
Watling-street
,
to
watch
for
the
Prior
of
*NL*
Jorvaulx
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
well
thought
on
also
,
''
replied
the
Captain
;
--
``
and
where
is
the
*NL*
Friar
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
his
cell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thither
will
I
go
,
''
said
Locksley
.
``
Disperse
and
seek
your
companions
.
*NL*
Collect
what
force
you
can
,
for
there
's
game
afoot
that
must
be
hunted
*NL*
hard
,
and
will
turn
to
bay
.
Meet
me
here
by
daybreak
.
--
And
stay
,
''
he
*NL*
added
,
``
I
have
forgotten
what
is
most
necessary
of
the
whole
--
Two
of
*NL*
you
take
the
road
quickly
towards
Torquilstone
,
the
Castle
of
*NL*
Front-de-Boeuf
.
A
set
of
gallants
,
who
have
been
masquerading
in
such
*NL*
guise
as
our
own
,
are
carrying
a
band
of
prisoners
thither
--
Watch
them
*NL*
closely
,
for
even
if
they
reach
the
castle
before
we
collect
our
force
,
*NL*
our
honour
is
concerned
to
punish
them
,
and
we
will
find
means
to
do
so
.
*NL*
Keep
a
close
watch
on
them
therefore
;
and
dispatch
one
of
your
comrades
,
*NL*
the
lightest
of
foot
,
to
bring
the
news
of
the
yeomen
thereabout
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
promised
implicit
obedience
,
and
departed
with
alacrity
on
*NL*
their
different
errands
.
In
the
meanwhile
,
their
leader
and
his
two
*NL*
companions
,
who
now
looked
upon
him
with
great
respect
,
as
well
as
some
*NL*
fear
,
pursued
their
way
to
the
Chapel
of
Copmanhurst
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
had
reached
the
little
moonlight
glade
,
having
in
front
the
*NL*
reverend
,
though
ruinous
chapel
,
and
the
rude
hermitage
,
so
well
*NL*
suited
to
ascetic
devotion
,
Wamba
whispered
to
Gurth
,
``
If
this
be
the
*NL*
habitation
of
a
thief
,
it
makes
good
the
old
proverb
,
The
nearer
the
*NL*
church
the
farther
from
God
.
--
And
by
my
coxcomb
,
''
he
added
,
``
I
think
it
*NL*
be
even
so
--
Hearken
but
to
the
black
sanctus
which
they
are
singing
in
*NL*
the
hermitage
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
the
anchorite
and
his
guest
were
performing
,
at
the
full
extent
*NL*
of
their
very
powerful
lungs
,
an
old
drinking
song
,
of
which
this
was
*NL*
the
burden
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
trowl
the
brown
bowl
to
me
,
*NL*
Bully
boy
,
bully
boy
,
*NL*
Come

trowl
the
brown
bowl
to
me
:
*NL*
Ho

Jenkin
,
I
spy
a
knave
in
drinking
,
*NL*
Come
,
trowl
the
brown
bowl
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
that
is
not
ill
sung
,
''
said
Wamba
,
who
had
thrown
in
a
few
of
his
*NL*
own
flourishes
to
help
out
the
chorus
.
``
But
who
,
in
the
saint
's
name
,
*NL*
ever
expected
to
have
heard
such
a
jolly
chant
come
from
out
a
hermit
's
*NL*
cell
at
midnight
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marry
,
that
should
I
,
''
said
Gurth
,
``
for
the
jolly
Clerk
of
Copmanhurst
*NL*
is
a
known
man
,
and
kills
half
the
deer
that
are
stolen
in
this
walk
.
*NL*
Men
say
that
the
keeper
has
complained
to
his
official
,
and
that
he
*NL*
will
be
stripped
of
his
cowl
and
cope
altogether
,
if
he
keeps
not
better
*NL*
order
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
they
were
thus
speaking
,
Locksley
's
loud
and
repeated
knocks
had
*NL*
at
length
disturbed
the
anchorite
and
his
guest
.
``
By
my
beads
,
''
said
the
*NL*
hermit
,
stopping
short
in
a
grand
flourish
,
``
here
come
more
benighted
*NL*
guests
.
I
would
not
for
my
cowl
that
they
found
us
in
this
goodly
*NL*
exercise
.
All
men
have
their
enemies
,
good
Sir
Sluggard
;
and
there
be
*NL*
those
malignant
enough
to
construe
the
hospitable
refreshment
which
I
*NL*
have
been
offering
to
you
,
a
weary
traveller
,
for
the
matter
of
three
*NL*
short
hours
,
into
sheer
drunkenness
and
debauchery
,
vices
alike
alien
to
*NL*
my
profession
and
my
disposition
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Base
calumniators
!
''
replied
the
knight
;
``
I
would
I
had
the
chastising
*NL*
of
them
.
Nevertheless
,
Holy
Clerk
,
it
is
true
that
all
have
their
*NL*
enemies
;
and
there
be
those
in
this
very
land
whom
I
would
rather
speak
*NL*
to
through
the
bars
of
my
helmet
than
barefaced
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
thine
iron
pot
on
thy
head
then
,
friend
Sluggard
,
as
quickly
as
*NL*
thy
nature

said
the
hermit
,
``
while
I
remove
these
pewter
*NL*
flagons
,
whose
late
contents
run
strangely
in
mine
own
pate

*NL*
drown
the
clatter

for

feel
somewhat
unsteady

into

the
tune

thou
hearest

no

words

''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
he
struck
up
a
thundering
``
De
profundis
clamavi
''
,
under
cover
*NL*
of
which
he
removed
the
apparatus
of
their
banquet
:
while
the
knight
,
*NL*
laughing
heartily
,
and
arming
himself
all
the
while
,
assisted
his
host
*NL*
with
his
voice
from
time
to
time
as
his
mirth
permitted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
devil
's
matins
are
you
after

this
hour

said
a
voice
from
*NL*
without
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heaven
forgive
you

Traveller
!
''
said
the
hermit
,
whose
own
noise
,
*NL*
and
perhaps
his
nocturnal
potations
,
prevented
from
recognising
accents
*NL*
which
were
tolerably
familiar
to
him
--
``
Wend
on
your
way
,
in
the
name
of
*NL*
God
and
Saint
Dunstan
,
and
disturb
not
the
devotions
of
me
and
my
holy
*NL*
brother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mad
priest
,
''
answered
the
voice
from
without
,
``
open
to
Locksley
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
's
safe
--
all
's
right
,
''
said
the
hermit
to
his
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
who
is
he
?
''
said
the
Black
Knight
;
``
it
imports
me
much
to
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
he
?
''
answered
the
hermit
;
``
I
tell
thee
he
is
a
friend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
friend
?
''
answered
the
knight
;
``
for
he
may
be
friend
to
thee
*NL*
and
none
of
mine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
friend
?
''
replied
the
hermit
;
``
that
,
now
,
is
one
of
the
questions
*NL*
that
is
more
easily
asked
than
answered
.
What
friend
?
--
why
,
he
is
,
now
*NL*
that
I
bethink
me
a
little
,
the
very
same
honest
keeper
I
told
thee
of
a
*NL*
while
since
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
as
honest
a
keeper
as
thou
art
a
pious
hermit
,
''
replied
the
knight
,
*NL*
``
I
doubt
it
not
.
But
undo
the
door
to
him
before
he
beat
it
from
its
*NL*
hinges

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
dogs
,
in
the
meantime
,
which
had
made
a
dreadful
baying
at
the
*NL*
commencement
of
the
disturbance
,
seemed
now
to
recognise
the
voice
*NL*
of
him
who
stood
without
;
for
,
totally
changing
their
manner
,
they
*NL*
scratched
and
whined
at
the
door
,
as
if
interceding
for
his
admission
.
*NL*
The
hermit
speedily
unbolted
his
portal
,
and
admitted
Locksley
,
with
his
*NL*
two
companions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
hermit
,
''
was
the
yeoman
's
first
question
as
soon
as
he
beheld
the
*NL*
knight
,
``
what
boon
companion
hast
thou
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
brother
of
our
order
,
''
replied
the
friar
,
shaking
his
head
;
``
we
have
*NL*
been
at
our
orisons
all
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
a
monk
of
the
church
militant
,
I
think
,
''
answered
Locksley
;
``
and
*NL*
there
be
more
of
them
abroad
.
I
tell
thee
,
friar
,
thou
must
lay
down
*NL*
the
rosary
and
take
up
the
quarter-staff
;
we
shall
need
every
one
of
our
*NL*
merry
men
,
whether
clerk
or
layman
.
--
But
,
''
he
added
,
taking
him
a
step
*NL*
aside
,
``
art
thou
mad
?
to
give
admittance
to
a
knight
thou
dost
not
know
?
*NL*
Hast
thou
forgot
our
articles
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
know
him
!
''
replied
the
friar
,
boldly
,
``
I
know
him
as
well
as
the
*NL*
beggar
knows
his
dish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
is
his
name
,
then
?
''
demanded
Locksley
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
name
,
''
said
the
hermit
--
``
his
name
is
Sir
Anthony
of
*NL*
Scrabelstone
--
as
if
I
would
drink
with
a
man
,
and
did
not
know
his
*NL*
name
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
hast
been
drinking
more
than
enough
,
friar
,
''
said
the
woodsman
,
*NL*
``
and
,
I
fear
,
prating
more
than
enough
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
yeoman
,
''
said
the
knight
,
coming
forward
,
``
be
not
wroth
with
my
*NL*
merry
host
.
He
did
but
afford
me
the
hospitality
which
I
would
have
*NL*
compelled
from
him
if
he
had
refused
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
compel
!
''
said
the
friar
;
``
wait
but
till
have
changed
this
grey
*NL*
gown
for
a
green
cassock
,
and
if
I
make
not
a
quarter-staff
ring
twelve
*NL*
upon
thy
pate
,
I
am
neither
true
clerk
nor
good
woodsman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
he
spoke
thus
,
he
stript
off
his
gown
,
and
appeared
in
a
close
*NL*
black
buckram
doublet
and
drawers
,
over
which
he
speedily
did
on
a
*NL*
cassock
of
green
,
and
hose
of
the
same
colour
.
``
I
pray
thee
truss
my
*NL*
points
,
''
said
he
to
Wamba
,
``
and
thou
shalt
have
a
cup
of
sack
for
thy
*NL*
labour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gramercy
for
thy
sack
,
''
said
Wamba
;
``
but
think
`
st
thou
it
is
lawful
*NL*
for
me
to
aid
you
to
transmew
thyself
from
a
holy
hermit
into
a
sinful
*NL*
forester
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
fear
,
''
said
the
hermit
;
``
I
will
but
confess
the
sins
of
my
green
*NL*
cloak
to
my
greyfriar
's
frock
,
and
all
shall
be
well
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Amen
!
''
answered
the
Jester
;
``
a
broadcloth
penitent
should
have
a
*NL*
sackcloth
confessor
,
and
your
frock
may
absolve
my
motley
doublet
into
*NL*
the
bargain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
he
accommodated
the
friar
with
his
assistance
in
tying
the
*NL*
endless
number
of
points
,
as
the
laces
which
attached
the
hose
to
the
*NL*
doublet
were
then
termed
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
they
were
thus
employed
,
Locksley
led
the
knight
a
little
apart
,
*NL*
and
addressed
him
thus
:
--
``
Deny
it
not
,
Sir
Knight
--
you
are
he
who
*NL*
decided
the
victory
to
the
advantage
of
the
English
against
the
*NL*
strangers
on
the
second
day
of
the
tournament
at
Ashby
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
follows
if
you
guess
truly
,
good
yeoman
?
''
replied
the
knight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
in
that
case
hold
you
,
''
replied
the
yeoman
,
``
a
friend
to
the
*NL*
weaker
party
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Such
is
the
duty
of
a
true
knight
at
least
,
''
replied
the
Black
*NL*
Champion
;
``
and
I
would
not
willingly
that
there
were
reason
to
think
*NL*
otherwise
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
for
my
purpose
,
''
said
the
yeoman
,
``
thou
shouldst
be
as
well
a
*NL*
good
Englishman
as
a
good
knight
;
for
that
,
which
I
have
to
speak
of
,
*NL*
concerns
,
indeed
,
the
duty
of
every
honest
man
,
but
is
more
especially
*NL*
that
of
a
true-born
native
of
England
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
speak
to
no
one
,
''
replied
the
knight
,
``
to
whom
England
,
and
the
*NL*
life
of
every
Englishman
,
can
be
dearer
than
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
willingly
believe
so
,
''
said
the
woodsman
,
``
for
never
had
this
*NL*
country
such
need
to
be
supported
by
those
who
love
her
.
Hear
me
,
and
*NL*
I
will
tell
thee
of
an
enterprise
,
in
which
,
if
thou
be
`
st
really
*NL*
that
which
thou
seemest
,
thou
mayst
take
an
honourable
part
.
A
band
*NL*
of
villains
,
in
the
disguise
of
better
men
than
themselves
,
have
made
*NL*
themselves
master
of
the
person
of
a
noble
Englishman
,
called
Cedric
*NL*
the
Saxon
,
together
with
his
ward
,
and
his
friend
Athelstane
of
*NL*
Coningsburgh
,
and
have
transported
them
to
a
castle
in
this
forest
,
*NL*
called
Torquilstone
.
I
ask
of
thee
,
as
a
good
knight
and
a
good
*NL*
Englishman
,
wilt
thou
aid
in
their
rescue
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
bound
by
my
vow
to
do
so
,
''
replied
the
knight
;
``
but
I
would
*NL*
willingly
know
who
you
are
,
who
request
my
assistance
in
their
behalf

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
,
''
said
the
forester
,
``
a
nameless
man

I
am
the
friend

With
this
account

you
must
*NL*
for
the
present
remain
satisfied
,
the
more
especially
since
you
yourself
*NL*
desire
to
continue
unknown

Believe
,
however

that
my
word

when
*NL*
pledged

is
as
inviolate
as

I
wore
golden
spurs

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
willingly
believe
it

said
the
knight
;

I

I
can
read
in
thine
honesty

resolution
.
I
will
,
therefore
,
ask
thee
no
further
questions
,

aid
*NL*
thee
in
setting
at
freedom
these
oppressed
captives

done

I
trust

shall
part

*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
''
said
Wamba
to
Gurth
,
--
for
the
friar
being
now
fully
equipped
,
the
*NL*
Jester
,
having
approached
to
the
other
side
of
the
hut
,
had
heard
the
*NL*
conclusion
of
the
conversation
,
--
``
So
we
have
got
a
new
ally
?
--
l
trust
*NL*
the
valour
of
the
knight
will
be
truer
metal
than
the
religion
of
the
*NL*
hermit
,
or
the
honesty
of
the
yeoman
;
for
this
Locksley
looks
like
a
*NL*
born
deer-stealer
,
and
the
priest
like
a
lusty
hypocrite
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
thy
peace
,
Wamba
,
''
said
Gurth
;
``
it
may
all
be
as
thou
dost
guess
;
*NL*
but
were
the
horned
devil
to
rise
and
proffer
me
his
assistance
to
*NL*
set
at
liberty
Cedric
and
the
Lady
Rowena
,
I
fear
I
should
hardly
have
*NL*
religion
enough
to
refuse
the
foul
fiend
's
offer
,
and
bid
him
get
behind
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
friar
was
now
completely
accoutred
as
a
yeoman
,
with
sword
and
*NL*
buckler
,
bow
,
and
quiver
,
and
a
strong
partisan
over
his
shoulder
.
He
*NL*
left
his
cell
at
the
head
of
the
party
,
and
,
having
carefully
locked
the
*NL*
door
,
deposited
the
key
under
the
threshold
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Art
thou
in
condition
to
do
good
service

said
Locksley
,
``
or
*NL*
does
the
brown
bowl
still
run
in
thy
head
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
more
than
a
drought
of
St
Dunstan
's
fountain
will
allay
,
''
answered
*NL*
the
priest
;
``
something
there
is
of
a
whizzing
in
my
brain
,
and
of
*NL*
instability
in
my
legs
,
but
you
shall
presently
see
both
pass
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
he
stepped
to
the
stone
basin
,
in
which
the
waters
of
*NL*
the
fountain
as
they
fell
formed
bubbles
which
danced
in
the
white
*NL*
moonlight
,
and
took
so
long
a
drought
as
if
he
had
meant
to
exhaust
the
*NL*
spring
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
didst
thou
drink
as
deep
a
drought
of
water
before
,
Holy
Clerk
of
*NL*
Copmanhurst
?

said
the
Black
Knight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
since
my
wine-butt
leaked
,
and
let
out
its
liquor
by
an
illegal

vent

replied
the
friar
,
``
and
so
left
me
nothing

my

patron

bounty
here

*NL*
*NL*
Then
plunging
his
hands
and
head
into
the
fountain
,
he
washed
from
them
*NL*
all
marks
of
the
midnight
revel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
refreshed
and
sobered
,
the
jolly
priest
twirled
his
heavy
partisan
*NL*
round
his
head
with
three
fingers
,
as
if
he
had
been
balancing
a
reed
,
*NL*
exclaiming
at
the
same
time
,
``
Where

false
ravishers

May

off
with

*NL*
*NL*

While

in

Cedric

*NL*
the
armed
men
by

had

along

to
imprison
*NL*
them
.
But
darkness
came
on
fast
,
and
the
paths
of
the
wood
seemed
but
*NL*
imperfectly
known
to
the
marauders
.
They
were
compelled
to
make
several
*NL*
long
halts
,
and
once
or
twice
to
return
on
their
road
to
resume
the
*NL*
direction
which
they
wished
to
pursue
.
The
summer
morn
had
dawned
upon
*NL*
them
ere
they
could
travel
in
full
assurance
that
they
held
the
right
*NL*
path
.
But
confidence
returned
with
light
,
and
the
cavalcade
now
moved
*NL*
rapidly
forward
.
Meanwhile
,
the
following
dialogue
took
place
between
*NL*
the
two
leaders
of
the
banditti
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
time
thou
shouldst
leave
us
,
Sir
Maurice
,
''
said
the
Templar
to
*NL*
De
Bracy
,
``
in
order
to
prepare
the
second
part
of
thy
mystery
.
Thou
art
*NL*
next
,
thou
knowest
,
to
act
the
Knight
Deliverer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
thought
better
of
it
,
''
said
De
Bracy
;
``
I
will
not
leave
thee
*NL*
till
the
prize
is
fairly
deposited
in
Front-de-Boeuf
's
castle
.
There
*NL*
will
I
appear
before
the
Lady
Rowena
in
mine
own
shape
,
and
trust
that
*NL*
she
will
set
down
to
the
vehemence
of
my
passion
the
violence
of
which
I
*NL*
have
been
guilty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
has
made
thee
change
thy
plan
,
De
Bracy
?
''
replied
the
Knight
*NL*
Templar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
concerns
thee
nothing
,
''
answered
his
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
hope
,
however
,
Sir
Knight
,
''
said
the
Templar
,
``
that
this
*NL*
alteration
of
measures
arises
from
no
suspicion
of
my
honourable
*NL*
meaning
,
such
as
Fitzurse
endeavoured
to
instil
into
thee
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
thoughts
are
my
own
,
''
answered
De
Bracy
;
``
the
fiend
laughs
,
they
*NL*
say
,
when
one
thief
robs
another
;
and
we
know
,
that
were
he
to
spit
fire
*NL*
and
brimstone
instead
,
it
would
never
prevent
a
Templar
from
following
*NL*
his
bent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
the
leader
of
a
Free
Company
,
''
answered
the
Templar
,
``
from
dreading
*NL*
at
the
hands
of
a
comrade
and
friend
,
the
injustice
he
does
to
all
*NL*
mankind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
unprofitable
and
perilous
recrimination
,
''
answered
De
Bracy
;
*NL*
``
suffice
it
to
say
,
I
know
the
morals
of
the
Temple-Order
,
and
I
will
*NL*
not
give
thee
the
power
of
cheating
me
out
of
the
fair
prey
for
which
I
*NL*
have
run
such
risks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Psha
,
''
replied
the
Templar
,
``
what
hast
thou
to
fear
?
--
Thou
knowest
the
*NL*
vows
of
our
order
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Right
well
,
''
said
De
Bracy
,
``
and
also
how
they
are
kept
.
Come
,
*NL*
Sir
Templar
,
the
laws
of
gallantry
have
a
liberal
interpretation
in
*NL*
Palestine
,
and
this
is
a
case
in
which
I
will
trust
nothing
to
your
*NL*
conscience
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hear
the
truth
,
then
,
''
said
the
Templar
;
``
I
care
not
for
your
blue-eyed
*NL*
beauty
.
There
is
in
that
train
one
who
will
make
me
a
better
mate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
wouldst
thou
stoop
to
the
waiting
damsel
?
''
said
De
Bracy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Sir
Knight
,
''
said
the
Templar
,
haughtily
.
``
To
the
waiting-woman
*NL*
will
I
not
stoop
.
I
have
a
prize
among
the
captives
as
lovely
as
thine
*NL*
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
mass
,
thou
meanest
the
fair
Jewess
!
''
said
De
Bracy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
if
I
do
,
''
said
Bois-Guilbert
,
``
who
shall
gainsay
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
one
that
I
know
,
''
said
De
Bracy
,
``
unless
it
be
your
vow
of
celibacy
,
*NL*
or
a
check
of
conscience
for
an
intrigue
with
a
Jewess
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
my
vow
,
''
said
the
Templar
,
``
our
Grand
Master
hath
granted
me
a
*NL*
dispensation
.
And
for
my
conscience
,
a
man
that
has
slain
three
hundred
*NL*
Saracens
,
need
not
reckon
up
every
little
failing
,
like
a
village
girl
*NL*
at
her
first
confession
upon
Good
Friday
eve
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
knowest
best
thine
own
privileges
,
''
said
De
Bracy
.
``
Yet
,
I
would
*NL*
have
sworn
thy
thought
had
been
more
on
the
old
usurer
's
money
bags
,
*NL*
than
on
the
black
eyes
of
the
daughter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
admire
both
,
''
answered
the
Templar
;
``
besides
,
the
old
Jew
is
but
*NL*
half-prize
.
I
must
share
his
spoils
with
Front-de-Boeuf
,
who
will
not
*NL*
lend
us
the
use
of
his
castle
for
nothing
.
I
must
have
something
that
I
*NL*
can
term
exclusively
my
own
by
this
foray
of
ours
,
and
I
have
fixed
on
*NL*
the
lovely
Jewess
as
my
peculiar
prize
.
But
,
now
thou
knowest
my
drift
,
*NL*
thou
wilt
resume
thine
own
original
plan
,
wilt
thou
not
?
--
Thou
hast
*NL*
nothing
,
thou
seest
,
to
fear
from
my
interference
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
replied
De
Bracy
,
``
I
will
remain
beside
my
prize
.
What
thou
*NL*
sayst
is
passing
true
,
but
I
like
not
the
privileges
acquired
by
*NL*
the
dispensation
of
the
Grand
Master
,
and
the
merit
acquired
by
the
*NL*
slaughter
of
three
hundred
Saracens
.
You
have
too
good
a
right
to
a
free
*NL*
pardon
,
to
render
you
very
scrupulous
about
peccadilloes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
this
dialogue
was
proceeding
,
Cedric
was
endeavouring
to
wring
out
*NL*
of
those
who
guarded
him
an
avowal
of
their
character
and
purpose
.
``
You
*NL*
should
be
Englishmen
,
''
said
he
;
``
and
yet
,
sacred
Heaven
!
you
prey
*NL*
upon
your
countrymen
as
if
you
were
very
Normans
.
You
should
be
my
*NL*
neighbours
,
and
,
if
so
,
my
friends
;
for
which
of
my
English
neighbours
*NL*
have
reason
to
be
otherwise
?
I
tell
ye
,
yeomen
,
that
even
those
among
ye
*NL*
who
have
been
branded
with
outlawry
have
had
from
me
protection
;
for
I
*NL*
have
pitied
their
miseries
,
and
curst
the
oppression
of
their
tyrannic
*NL*
nobles
.
What
,
then
,
would
you
have
of
me
?
or
in
what
can
this
violence
*NL*
serve
ye
?
--
Ye
are
worse
than
brute
beasts
in
your
actions
,
and
will
you
*NL*
imitate
them
in
their
very
dumbness
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
vain
that
Cedric
expostulated
with
his
guards
,
who
had
too
*NL*
many
good
reasons
for
their
silence
to
be
induced
to
break
it
either
*NL*
by
his
wrath
or
his
expostulations
.
They
continued
to
hurry
him
along
,
*NL*
travelling
at
a
very
rapid
rate
,
until
,
at
the
end
of
an
avenue
of
huge
*NL*
trees
,
arose
Torquilstone
,
now
the
hoary
and
ancient
castle
of
Reginald
*NL*
Front-de-Boeuf
.
It
was
a
fortress
of
no
great
size
,
consisting
of
a
*NL*
donjon
,
or
large
and
high
square
tower
,
surrounded
by
buildings
of
*NL*
inferior
height
,
which
were
encircled
by
an
inner
court-yard
.
Around
the
*NL*
exterior
wall
was
a
deep
moat
,
supplied
with
water
from
a
neighbouring
*NL*
rivulet
.
Front-de-Boeuf
,
whose
character
placed
him
often
at
feud
with
*NL*
his
enemies
,
had
made
considerable
additions
to
the
strength
of
his
*NL*
castle
,
by
building
towers
upon
the
outward
wall
,
so
as
to
flank
it
at
*NL*
every
angle
.
The
access
,
as
usual
in
castles
of
the
period
,
lay
through
*NL*
an
arched
barbican
,
or
outwork
,
which
was
terminated
and
defended
by
a
*NL*
small
turret
at
each
corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cedric
no
sooner
saw
the
turrets
of
Front-de-Boeuf
's
castle
raise
their
*NL*
grey
and
moss-grown
battlements
,
glimmering
in
the
morning
sun
above
the
*NL*
wood
by
which
they
were
surrounded
,
than
he
instantly
augured
more
truly
*NL*
concerning
the
cause
of
his
misfortune
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
injustice
,
''
he
said
,
``
to
the
thieves
and
outlaws
of
these
woods
,
*NL*
when
I
supposed
such
banditti
to
belong
to
their
bands
;
I
might
as
*NL*
justly
have
confounded
the
foxes
of
these
brakes
with
the
ravening
*NL*
wolves
of
France
.
Tell
me
,
dogs
--
is
it
my
life
or
my
wealth
that
your
*NL*
master
aims
at
?
Is
it
too
much
that
two
Saxons
,
myself
and
the
noble
*NL*
Athelstane
,
should
hold
land
in
the
country
which
was
once
the
patrimony
*NL*
of
our
race
?
--
Put
us
then
to
death
,
and
complete
your
tyranny
by
taking
*NL*
our
lives
,
as
you
began
with
our
liberties
.
If
the
Saxon
Cedric
can
not
*NL*
rescue
England
,
he
is
willing
to
die
for
her
.
Tell
your
tyrannical
*NL*
master
,
I
do
only
beseech
him
to
dismiss
the
Lady
Rowena
in
honour
and
*NL*
safety
.
She
is
a
woman
,
and
he
need
not
dread
her
;
and
with
us
will
die
*NL*
all
who
dare
fight
in
her
cause
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
attendants
remained
as
mute
to
this
address
as
to
the
former
,
and
*NL*
they
now
stood
before
the
gate
of
the
castle
.
De
Bracy
winded
his
horn
*NL*
three
times
,
and
the
archers
and
cross-bow
men
,
who
had
manned
the
wall
*NL*
upon
seeing
their
approach
,
hastened
to
lower
the
drawbridge
,
and
admit
*NL*
them
.
The
prisoners
were
compelled
by
their
guards
to
alight
,
and
were
*NL*
conducted
to
an
apartment
where
a
hasty
repast
was
offered
them
,
of
*NL*
which
none
but
Athelstane
felt
any
inclination
to
partake
.
Neither
had
*NL*
the
descendant
of
the
Confessor
much
time
to
do
justice
to
the
good
*NL*
cheer
placed
before
them
,
for
their
guards
gave
him
and
Cedric
to
*NL*
understand
that
they
were
to
be
imprisoned
in
a
chamber
apart
from
*NL*
Rowena
.
Resistance
was
vain
;
and
they
were
compelled
to
follow
to
a
*NL*
large
room
,
which
,
rising
on
clumsy
Saxon
pillars
,
resembled
those
*NL*
refectories
and
chapter-houses
which
may
be
still
seen
in
the
most
*NL*
ancient
parts
of
our
most
ancient
monasteries
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Lady
Rowena
was
next
separated
from
her
train
,
and
conducted
,
with
*NL*
courtesy
,
indeed
,
but
still
without
consulting
her
inclination
,
to
*NL*
a
distant
apartment
.
The
same
alarming
distinction
was
conferred
on
*NL*
Rebecca
,
in
spite
of
her
father
's
entreaties
,
who
offered
even
money
,
*NL*
in
this
extremity
of
distress
,
that
she
might
be
permitted
to
abide
with
*NL*
him
.
``
Base
unbeliever
,
''
answered
one
of
his
guards
,
``
when
thou
hast
seen
*NL*
thy
lair
,
thou
wilt
not
wish
thy
daughter
to
partake
it
.
''
And
,
without
*NL*
farther
discussion
,
the
old
Jew
was
forcibly
dragged
off
in
a
different
*NL*
direction
from
the
other
prisoners
.
The
domestics
,
after
being
carefully
*NL*
searched
and
disarmed
,
were
confined
in
another
part
of
the
castle
;
*NL*
and
Rowena
was
refused
even
the
comfort
she
might
have
derived
from
the
*NL*
attendance
of
her
handmaiden
Elgitha
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
apartment
in
which
the
Saxon
chiefs
were
confined
,
for
to
them
*NL*
we
turn
our
first
attention
,
although
at
present
used
as
a
sort
of
*NL*
guard-room
,
had
formerly
been
the
great
hall
of
the
castle
.
It
was
now
*NL*
abandoned
to
meaner
purposes
,
because
the
present
lord
,
among
other
*NL*
additions
to
the
convenience
,
security
,
and
beauty
of
his
baronial
*NL*
residence
,
had
erected
a
new
and
noble
hall
,
whose
vaulted
roof
was
*NL*
supported
by
lighter
and
more
elegant
pillars
,
and
fitted
up
with
that
*NL*
higher
degree
of
ornament
,
which
the
Normans
had
already
introduced
into
*NL*
architecture
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cedric
paced
the
apartment
,
filled
with
indignant
reflections
on
the
*NL*
past
and
on
the
present
,
while
the
apathy
of
his
companion
served
,
*NL*
instead
of
patience
and
philosophy
,
to
defend
him
against
every
thing
*NL*
save
the
inconvenience
of
the
present
moment
;
and
so
little
did
he
feel
*NL*
even
this
last
,
that
he
was
only
from
time
to
time
roused
to
a
reply
by
*NL*
Cedric
's
animated
and
impassioned
appeal
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Cedric
,
half
speaking
to
himself
,
and
half
addressing
*NL*
himself
to
Athelstane
,
``
it
was
in
this
very
hall
that
my
father
feasted
*NL*
with
Torquil
Wolfganger
,
when
he
entertained
the
valiant
and
unfortunate
*NL*
Harold
,
then
advancing
against
the
Norwegians
,
who
had
united
themselves
*NL*
to
the
rebel
Tosti
.
It
was
in
this
hall
that
Harold
returned
the
*NL*
magnanimous
answer
to
the
ambassador
of
his
rebel
brother
.
Oft
have
*NL*
I
heard
my
father
kindle
as
he
told
the
tale
.
The
envoy
of
Tosti
was
*NL*
admitted
,
when
this
ample
room
could
scarce
contain
the
crowd
of
*NL*
noble
Saxon
leaders
,
who
were
quaffing
the
blood-red
wine
around
their
*NL*
monarch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
,
''
said
Athelstane
,
somewhat
moved
by
this
part
of
his
friend
's
*NL*
discourse
,
``
they
will
not
forget
to
send
us
some
wine
and
refactions
at
*NL*
noon
--
we
had
scarce
a
breathing-space
allowed
to
break
our
fast
,
and
*NL*
I
never
have
the
benefit
of
my
food
when
I
eat
immediately
after
*NL*
dismounting
from
horseback
,
though
the
leeches
recommend
that
practice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cedric
went
on
with
his
story
without
noticing
this
interjectional
*NL*
observation
of
his
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
envoy
of
Tosti
,
''
he
said
,
``
moved
up
the
hall
,
undismayed
by
the
*NL*
frowning
countenances
of
all
around
him
,
until
he
made
his
obeisance
*NL*
before
the
throne
of
King
Harold
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
What
terms
,
'
he
said
,
`
Lord
King
,
hath
thy
brother
Tosti
to
hope
,
if
*NL*
he
should
lay
down
his
arms
,

crave
peace
at
thy
hands
?

his

beheld

the
King

both
fell

with

Who
would
have
thought
that
upon

the
proud
day
when
this
battle
was
won
,
the
very
gale
which
waved
the

was
filling
the

impelling

Who
would
have
thought
that
you

that
you

and
that
I
,
whose
father
was
not
the
worst
*NL*
defender
of

should
be
prisoners
to
a
vile
Norman
,
in
*NL*
the
very
hall
in
which
our
ancestors
held
such
high
festival
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
sad
enough
,
''
replied
Athelstane
;
``
but
I
trust
they
will
hold
us
*NL*
to
a
moderate
ransom

At
any
rate
it
can
not
be
their
purpose

starve

us
outright
;
and
yet
,
although
it
is
high
noon
,
I
see
no
preparations
*NL*
for
serving
dinner

Look
up
at
the
window
,
noble
Cedric
,
and
judge
by
*NL*
the
sunbeams
if
it
is
not
on
the
verge
of
noon

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
may
be
so
,
''
answered
Cedric
;
``
but
I
can
not
look
on
that
stained
*NL*
lattice
without
its
awakening
other
reflections
than
those
which
concern
*NL*
the
passing
moment
,
or
its
privations
.
When
that
window
was
wrought
,
my
*NL*
noble
friend
,
our
hardy
fathers
knew
not
the
art
of
making
glass
,
or
*NL*
of
staining
it
--
The
pride
of
Wolfganger
's
father
brought
an
artist
from
*NL*
Normandy
to
adorn
his
hall
with
this
new
species
of
emblazonment
,
that
*NL*
breaks
the
golden
light
of
God
's
blessed
day
into
so
many
fantastic
*NL*
hues
.
The
foreigner
came
here
poor
,
beggarly
,
cringing
,
and
subservient
,
*NL*
ready
to
doff
his
cap
to
the
meanest
native
of
the
household
.
He
*NL*
returned
pampered
and
proud
,
to
tell
his
rapacious
countrymen
of
the
*NL*
wealth
and
the
simplicity
of
the
Saxon
nobles
--
a
folly
,
oh
,
Athelstane
,
*NL*
foreboded
of
old
,
as
well
as
foreseen
,
by
those
descendants
of
Hengist
*NL*
and
his
hardy
tribes
,
who
retained
the
simplicity
of
their
manners
.
We
*NL*
made
these
strangers
our
bosom
friends
,
our
confidential
servants
;
*NL*
we
borrowed
their
artists
and
their
arts
,
and
despised
the
honest
*NL*
simplicity
and
hardihood
with
which
our
brave
ancestors
supported
*NL*
themselves
,
and
we
became
enervated
by
Norman
arts
long
ere
we
fell
*NL*
under
Norman
arms
.
Far
better
was
our
homely
diet
,
eaten
in
peace
and
*NL*
liberty
,
than
the
luxurious
dainties
,
the
love
of
which
hath
delivered
*NL*
us
as
bondsmen
to
the
foreign
conqueror
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
,
''
replied
Athelstane
,
``
hold
very
humble
diet
a
luxury
at
*NL*
present
;
and
it
astonishes
me
,
noble
Cedric
,
that
you
can
bear
so
truly
*NL*
in
mind
the
memory
of
past
deeds
,
when
it
appeareth
you
forget
the
very
*NL*
hour
of
dinner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
time
lost
,
''
muttered
Cedric
apart
and
impatiently
,
``
to
speak
*NL*
to
him
of
aught
else
but
that
which
concerns
his
appetite
!
The
soul
of
*NL*
Hardicanute
hath
taken
possession
of
him
,
and
he
hath
no
pleasure
save
*NL*
to
fill
,
to
swill
,
and
to
call
for
more
.
--
Alas
!
''
said
he
,
looking
at
*NL*
Athelstane
with
compassion
,
``
that
so
dull
a
spirit
should
be
lodged
in
*NL*
so
goodly
a
form
!
Alas
!
that
such
an
enterprise
as
the
regeneration
of
*NL*
England
should
turn
on
a
hinge
so
imperfect
!
Wedded
to
Rowena
,
indeed
,
*NL*
her
nobler
and
more
generous
soul
may
yet
awake
the
better
nature
which
*NL*
is
torpid
within
him
.
Yet
how
should
this
be
,
while
Rowena
,
Athelstane
,
*NL*
and
I
myself
,
remain
the
prisoners
of
this
brutal
marauder
and
have
*NL*
been
made
so
perhaps
from
a
sense
of
the
dangers
which
our
liberty
might
*NL*
bring
to
the
usurped
power
of
his
nation
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
Saxon
was
plunged
in
these
painful
reflections
,
the
door
of
*NL*
their
prison
opened
,
and
gave
entrance
to
a
sewer
,
holding
his
white
rod
*NL*
of
office
.
This
important
person
advanced
into
the
chamber
with
a
grave
*NL*
pace
,
followed
by
four
attendants
,
bearing
in
a
table
covered
*NL*
with
dishes
,
the
sight
and
smell
of
which
seemed
to
be
an
instant
*NL*
compensation
to
Athelstane
for
all
the
inconvenience
he
had
undergone
.
*NL*
The
persons
who
attended
on
the
feast
were
masked
and
cloaked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
mummery
is
this
?
''
said
Cedric
;
``
think
you
that
we
are
ignorant
*NL*
whose
prisoners
we
are
,
when
we
are
in
the
castle
of
your
master
?
*NL*
Tell
him
,
''
he
continued
,
willing
to
use
this
opportunity
to
open
*NL*
a
negotiation
for
his
freedom
,
--
``
Tell
your
master
,
Reginald
*NL*
Front-de-Boeuf
,
that
we
know
no
reason
he
can
have
for
withholding
our
*NL*
liberty
,
excepting
his
unlawful
desire
to
enrich
himself
at
our
expense
.
*NL*
Tell
him
that
we
yield
to
his
rapacity
,
as
in
similar
circumstances
we
*NL*
should
do
to
that
of
a
literal
robber
.
Let
him
name
the
ransom
at
which
*NL*
he
rates
our
liberty
,
and
it
shall
be
paid
,
providing
the
exaction
is
*NL*
suited
to
our
means
.
''
The
sewer
made
no
answer
,
but
bowed
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
tell
Sir
Reginald
Front-de-Boeuf
,
''
said
Athelstane
,
``
that
I
send
*NL*
him
my
mortal
defiance
,
and
challenge
him
to
combat
with
me
,
on
foot
or
*NL*
horseback
,
at
any
secure
place
,
within
eight
days
after
our
liberation
;
*NL*
which
,
if
he
be
a
true
knight
,
he
will
not
,
under
these
circumstances
,
*NL*
venture
to
refuse
or
to
delay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
deliver
to
the
knight
your
defiance
,
''
answered
the
sewer
;
*NL*
``
meanwhile
I
leave
you
to
your
food
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
challenge
of
Athelstane
was
delivered
with
no
good
grace
;
for
a
*NL*
large
mouthful
,
which
required
the
exercise
of
both
jaws
at
once
,
added
*NL*
to
a
natural
hesitation
,
considerably
damped
the
effect
of
the
bold
*NL*
defiance
it
contained
.
Still
,
however
,
his
speech
was
hailed
by
Cedric
*NL*
as
an
incontestible
token
of
reviving
spirit
in
his
companion
,
whose
*NL*
previous
indifference
had
begun
,
notwithstanding
his
respect
for
*NL*
Athelstane
's
descent
,
to
wear
out
his
patience
.
But
he
now
cordially
*NL*
shook
hands
with
him
in
token
of
his
approbation
,
and
was
somewhat
*NL*
grieved
when
Athelstane
observed
,
``
that
he
would
fight
a
dozen
such
men
*NL*
as
Front-de-Boeuf
,
if
,
by
so
doing
,
he
could
hasten
his
departure
from
*NL*
a
dungeon
where
they
put
so
much
garlic
into
their
pottage
.
''
*NL*
Notwithstanding
this
intimation
of
a
relapse
into
the
apathy
of
*NL*
sensuality
,
Cedric
placed
himself
opposite
to
Athelstane
,
and
soon
*NL*
showed
,
that
if
the
distresses
of
his
country
could
banish
the
*NL*
recollection
of
food
while
the
table
was
uncovered
,
yet
no
sooner
were
*NL*
the
victuals
put
there
,
than
he
proved
that
the
appetite
of
his
Saxon
*NL*
ancestors
had
descended
to
him
along
with
their
other
qualities
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
captives
had
not
long
enjoyed
their
refreshment
,
however
,
ere
their
*NL*
attention
was
disturbed
even
from
this
most
serious
occupation
by
the
*NL*
blast
of
a
horn
winded
before
the
gate
.
It
was
repeated
three
times
,
*NL*
with
as
much
violence
as
if
it
had
been
blown
before
an
enchanted
castle
*NL*
by
the
destined
knight
,
at
whose
summons
halls
and
towers
,
barbican
and
*NL*
battlement
,
were
to
roll
off
like
a
morning
vapour
.
The
Saxons
started
*NL*
from
the
table
,
and
hastened
to
the
window
.
But
their
curiosity
was
*NL*
disappointed
;
for
these
outlets
only
looked
upon
the
court
of
the
*NL*
castle
,
and
the
sound
came
from
beyond
its
precincts
.
The
summons
,
*NL*
however
,
seemed
of
importance
,
for
a
considerable
degree
of
bustle
*NL*
instantly
took
place
in
the
castle
.

*NL*
*NL*
Leaving
the
Saxon
chiefs
to
return
to
their
banquet
as
soon
as
their
*NL*
ungratified
curiosity
should
permit
them
to
attend
to
the
calls
of
their
*NL*
half-satiated
appetite
,
we
have
to
look
in
upon
the
yet
more
severe
*NL*
imprisonment
of
Isaac
of
York
.
The
poor
Jew
had
been
hastily
thrust
into
*NL*
a
dungeon-vault
of
the
castle
,
the
floor
of
which
was
deep
beneath
*NL*
the
level
of
the
ground
,
and
very
damp
,
being
lower
than
even
the
moat
*NL*
itself
.
The
only
light
was
received
through
one
or
two
loop-holes
far
*NL*
above
the
reach
of
the
captive
's
hand
.
These
apertures
admitted
,
even
*NL*
at
mid-day
,
only
a
dim
and
uncertain
light
,
which
was
changed
for
utter
*NL*
darkness
long
before
the
rest
of
the
castle
had
lost
the
blessing
of
*NL*
day
.
Chains
and
shackles
,
which
had
been
the
portion
of
former
captives
,
*NL*
from
whom
active
exertions
to
escape
had
been
apprehended
,
hung
rusted
*NL*
and
empty
on
the
walls
of
the
prison
,
and
in
the
rings
of
one
of
those
*NL*
sets
of
fetters
there
remained
two
mouldering
bones
,
which
seemed
to
*NL*
have
been
once
those
of
the
human
leg
,
as
if
some
prisoner
had
been
left
*NL*
not
only
to
perish
there
,
but
to
be
consumed
to
a
skeleton
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
one
end
of
this
ghastly
apartment
was
a
large
fire-grate
,
over
the
*NL*
top
of
which
were
stretched
some
transverse
iron
bars
,
half
devoured
*NL*
with
rust
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
appearance
of
the
dungeon
might
have
appalled
a
stouter
heart
*NL*
than
that
of
Isaac
,
who
,
nevertheless
,
was
more
composed
under
the
*NL*
imminent
pressure
of
danger
,
than
he
had
seemed
to
be
while
affected
by
*NL*
terrors
,
of
which
the
cause
was
as
yet
remote
and
contingent
.
The
lovers
*NL*
of
the
chase
say
that
the
hare
feels
more
agony
during
the
pursuit
of
*NL*
the
greyhounds
,
than
when
she
is
struggling
in
their
fangs
.

*NL*
*NL*
And
thus
it
is
probable
,
that
the
Jews
,
by
the
very
frequency
of
their
*NL*
fear
on
all
occasions
,
had
their
minds
in
some
degree
prepared
for
*NL*
every
effort
of
tyranny
which
could
be
practised
upon
them
;
so
that
no
*NL*
aggression
,
when
it
had
taken
place
,
could
bring
with
it
that
surprise
*NL*
which
is
the
most
disabling
quality
of
terror
.
Neither
was
it
the
first
*NL*
time
that
Isaac
had
been
placed
in
circumstances
so
dangerous
.
He
had
*NL*
therefore
experience
to
guide
him
,
as
well
as
hope
,
that
he
might
again
,
*NL*
as
formerly
,
be
delivered
as
a
prey
from
the
fowler
.
Above
all
,
he
had
*NL*
upon
his
side
the
unyielding
obstinacy
of
his
nation
,
and
that
unbending
*NL*
resolution
,
with
which
Israelites
have
been
frequently
known
to
submit
*NL*
to
the
uttermost
evils
which
power
and
violence
can
inflict
upon
them
,
*NL*
rather
than
gratify
their
oppressors
by
granting
their
demands
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
humour
of
passive
resistance
,
and
with
his
garment
collected
*NL*
beneath
him
to
keep
his
limbs
from
the
wet
pavement
,
Isaac
sat
in
a
*NL*
corner
of
his
dungeon
,
where
his
folded
hands
,
his
dishevelled
hair
and
*NL*
beard
,
his
furred
cloak
and
high
cap
,
seen
by
the
wiry
and
broken
light
,
*NL*
would
have
afforded
a
study
for
Rembrandt
,
had
that
celebrated
painter
*NL*
existed
at
the
period
.
The
Jew
remained
,
without
altering
his
position
,
*NL*
for
nearly
three
hours
,
at
the
expiry
of
which
steps
were
heard
on
the
*NL*
dungeon
stair
.
The
bolts
screamed
as
they
were
withdrawn
--
the
hinges
*NL*
creaked
as
the
wicket
opened
,
and
Reginald
Front-de-Boeuf
,
followed
by
*NL*
the
two
Saracen
slaves
of
the
Templar
,
entered
the
prison
.
*NL*
*NL*
Front-de-Boeuf
,
a
tall
and
strong
man
,
whose
life
had
been
spent
in
*NL*
public
war
or
in
private
feuds
and
broils
,
and
who
had
hesitated
at
no
*NL*
means
of
extending
his
feudal
power
,
had
features
corresponding
to
his
*NL*
character
,
and
which
strongly
expressed
the
fiercer
and
more
malignant
*NL*
passions
of
the
mind
.
The
scars
with
which
his
visage
was
seamed
,
*NL*
would
,
on
features
of
a
different
cast
,
have
excited
the
sympathy
and
*NL*
veneration
due
to
the
marks
of
honourable
valour
;
but
,
in
the
peculiar
*NL*
case
of
Front-de-Boeuf
,
they
only
added
to
the
ferocity
of
his
*NL*
countenance
,
and
to
the
dread
which
his
presence
inspired
.
This
*NL*
formidable
baron
was
clad
in
a
leathern
doublet
,
fitted
close
to
his
*NL*
body
,
which
was
frayed
and
soiled
with
the
stains
of
his
armour
.
He
*NL*
had
no
weapon
,
excepting
a
poniard
at
his
belt
,
which
served
to
*NL*
counterbalance
the
weight
of
the
bunch
of
rusty
keys
that
hung
at
his
*NL*
right
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
black
slaves
who
attended
Front-de-Boeuf
were
stripped
of
their
*NL*
gorgeous
apparel
,
and
attired
in
jerkins
and
trowsers
of
coarse
linen
,
*NL*
their
sleeves
being
tucked
up
above
the
elbow
,
like
those
of
butchers
*NL*
when
about
to
exercise
their
function
in
the
slaughter-house
.
Each
had
*NL*
in
his
hand
a
small
pannier
;
and
,
when
they
entered
the
dungeon
,
they
*NL*
stopt
at
the
door
until
Front-de-Boeuf
himself
carefully
locked
and
*NL*
double-locked
it
.
Having
taken
this
precaution
,
he
advanced
slowly
up
*NL*
the
apartment
towards
the
Jew
,
upon
whom
he
kept
his
eye
fixed
,
as
if
*NL*
he
wished
to
paralyze
him
with
his
glance
,
as
some
animals
are
said
to
*NL*
fascinate
their
prey
.
It
seemed
indeed
as
if
the
sullen
and
malignant
*NL*
eye
of
Front-de-Boeuf
possessed
some
portion
of
that
supposed
power
over
*NL*
his
unfortunate
prisoner
.
The
Jew
sat
with
his
mouth
agape
,
and
his
*NL*
eyes
fixed
on
the
savage
baron
with
such
earnestness
of
terror
,
that
his
*NL*
frame
seemed
literally
to
shrink
together
,
and
to
diminish
in
size
while
*NL*
encountering
the
fierce
Norman
's
fixed
and
baleful
gaze
.
The
unhappy
*NL*
Isaac
was
deprived
not
only
of
the
power
of
rising
to
make
the
obeisance
*NL*
which
his
terror
dictated
,
but
he
could
not
even
doff
his
cap
,
or
utter
*NL*
any
word
of
supplication
;
so
strongly
was
he
agitated
by
the
conviction
*NL*
that
tortures
and
death
were
impending
over
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
other
hand
,
the
stately
form
of
the
Norman
appeared
to
dilate
*NL*
in
magnitude
,
like
that
of
the
eagle
,
which
ruffles
up
its
plumage
when
*NL*
about
to
pounce
on
its
defenceless
prey
.
He
paused
within
three
steps
*NL*
of
the
corner
in
which
the
unfortunate
Jew
had
now
,
as
it
were
,
coiled
*NL*
himself
up
into
the
smallest
possible
space
,
and
made
a
sign
for
one
of
*NL*
the
slaves
to
approach
.
The
black
satellite
came
forward
accordingly
,
*NL*
and
,
producing
from
his
basket
a
large
pair
of
scales
and
several
*NL*
weights
,
he
laid
them
at
the
feet
of
Front-de-Boeuf
,
and
again
retired
*NL*
to
the
respectful
distance
,
at
which
his
companion
had
already
taken
his
*NL*
station
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
motions
of
these
men
were
slow
and
solemn
,
as
if
there
impended
over
*NL*
their
souls
some
preconception
of
horror
and
of
cruelty
.
Front-de-Boeuf
*NL*
himself
opened
the
scene
by
thus
addressing
his
ill-fated
captive
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Most
accursed
dog
of
an
accursed
race
,
''
he
said
,
awaking
with
his
deep
*NL*
and
sullen
voice
the
sullen
echoes
of
his
dungeon
vault
,
``
seest
thou
*NL*
these
scales
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
unhappy
Jew
returned
a
feeble
affirmative
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
these
very
scales
shalt
thou
weigh
me
out
,
''
said
the
relentless
*NL*
Baron
,
``
a
thousand
silver
pounds
,
after
the
just
measure
and
weight
of
*NL*
the
Tower
of
London
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Holy
Abraham
!
''
returned
the
Jew
,
finding
voice
through
the
very
*NL*
extremity
of
his
danger
,
``
heard
man
ever
such
a
demand
?
--
Who
ever
*NL*
heard
,
even
in
a
minstrel
's
tale
,
of
such
a
sum
as
a
thousand
pounds
*NL*
of
silver
?
--
What
human
sight
was
ever
blessed
with
the
vision
of
such
*NL*
a
mass
of
treasure
?
--
Not
within
the
walls
of
York
,
ransack
my
house
*NL*
and
that
of
all
my
tribe
,
wilt
thou
find
the
tithe
of
that
huge
sum
of
*NL*
silver
that
thou
speakest
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
reasonable
,
''
answered
Front-de-Boeuf
,
``
and
if
silver
be
scant
,
I
*NL*
refuse
not
gold
.
At
the
rate
of
a
mark
of
gold
for
each
six
pounds
of
*NL*
silver
,
thou
shalt
free
thy
unbelieving
carcass
from
such
punishment
as
*NL*
thy
heart
has
never
even
conceived
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
mercy
on
me
,
noble
knight
!
''
exclaimed
Isaac
;
``
I
am
old
,
and
poor
,
*NL*
and
helpless
.
It
were
unworthy
to
triumph
over
me
--
It
is
a
poor
deed
to
*NL*
crush
a
worm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Old
thou
mayst
be
,
''
replied
the
knight
;
``
more
shame
to
their
folly
who
*NL*
have
suffered
thee
to
grow
grey
in
usury
and
knavery

be

for

a
Jew
either
heart

But

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
swear
to
you
,

knight

''
said
the
Jew
``
by
all
which
I
believe

*NL*
and
by
all
which
we
believe
in
common
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perjure
not
thyself
,
''
said
the
Norman
,
interrupting
him
,
``
and
let
not
*NL*
thine
obstinacy
seal
thy
doom
,
until
thou
hast
seen

well
considered
*NL*
the

that
awaits
thee
.
Think
not
I
speak
to
thee
only
to
excite
thy
*NL*
terror
,
and
practise
on
the
base
cowardice
thou
hast
derived
from
thy
*NL*
tribe
.
I
swear
to
thee
by
that
which
thou
dost
NOT
believe

by
the
*NL*
gospel
which
our
church
teaches

by

keys

are
given
her
to
*NL*
bind
and
to
loose

that
my
purpose

deep

peremptory

dungeon
is
no
place
for

thousand
times
more
*NL*
distinguished
than
thou
have
died
within
these
walls

But
for
thee
is
reserved
a
long
and
lingering

death

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
again
made
a
signal
for
the
slaves
to
approach
,
and
spoke
to
them
*NL*
apart
,
in
their
own
language
;
for
he
also
had
been
in
Palestine
,
where
*NL*
perhaps
,
he
had
learnt
his
lesson
of
cruelty
.
The
Saracens
produced
from
*NL*
their
baskets
a
quantity
of
charcoal
,
a
pair
of
bellows
,
and
a
flask
*NL*
of
oil
.
While
the
one
struck
a
light
with
a
flint
and
steel
,
the
other
*NL*
disposed
the
charcoal
in
the
large
rusty
grate
which
we
have
already
*NL*
mentioned
,
and
exercised
the
bellows
until
the
fuel
came
to
a
red
glow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Seest
thou
,
Isaac

said
Front-de-Boeuf
,
``

exclaimed
the

``
So

*NL*
*NL*
The
assistants
,
taking
their
directions
more
from
the
Baron
's
eye
and
*NL*
his
hand
than
his
tongue
,
once
more
stepped
forward

laid
hands
on
the
*NL*
unfortunate
Isaac
,
plucked
him
up
from
the
ground
,
and
,
holding
him
*NL*
between
them
,
waited
the
hard-hearted
Baron
's
farther
signal
.
The
*NL*
unhappy
Jew
eyed
their
countenances
and
that
of
Front-de-Boeuf
,
in
*NL*
hope
of
discovering
some
symptoms
of
relenting
;
but
that
of
the
Baron
*NL*
exhibited
the
same
cold
,
half-sullen
,
half-sarcastic
smile
which
had
*NL*
been
the
prelude
to
his
cruelty
;
and
the
savage
eyes
of
the
Saracens
,
*NL*
rolling
gloomily
under
their
dark
brows
,
acquiring
a
yet
more
sinister
*NL*
expression
by
the
whiteness
of
the
circle
which
surrounds
the
pupil
,
*NL*
evinced
rather
the
secret
pleasure
which
they
expected
from
the
*NL*
approaching
scene
,
than
any
reluctance
to
be
its
directors
or
agents
.
*NL*
The
Jew
then
looked
at
the
glowing
furnace
,
over
which
he
was
presently
*NL*
to
be
stretched
,
and
seeing
no
chance
of
his
tormentor
's
relenting

his
*NL*
resolution
gave
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

thou
hast
made
thy
choice
,
it
remains
but
that
thou
payest
down
thy
*NL*
ransom
,
and
that
at
a
short
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
hear
me
,
''
said
the
Jew
--
``
for
the
sake
of
that
very
wealth
which
*NL*
thou
wouldst
obtain
at
the
expense
of
thy

''
Here
he
stopt
short
,
*NL*
afraid
of
irritating
the
savage
Norman
.
But
Front-de-Boeuf
only
laughed
,
*NL*
and
himself
filled
up
the
blank
at
which
the
Jew
had
hesitated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
the
expense
of
my
conscience
,
thou
wouldst
say
,
Isaac
;
speak
it
*NL*
out
--
I
tell
thee
,
I
am
reasonable
.
I
can
bear
the
reproaches
of
a
loser
,
*NL*
even
when
that
loser
is
a
Jew
.
Thou
wert
not
so
patient
,
Isaac
,
when
*NL*
thou
didst
invoke
justice
against
Jacques
Fitzdotterel
,
for
calling
thee
*NL*
a
usurious
blood-sucker
,
when
thy
exactions
had
devoured
his
patrimony
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
swear
by
the
Talmud
,
''
said
the
Jew
,
``
that
your
valour
has
been
*NL*
misled
in
that
matter
.
Fitzdotterel
drew
his
poniard
upon
me
in
mine
own
*NL*
chamber
,
because
I
craved
him
for
mine
own
silver
.
The
term
of
payment
*NL*
was
due
at
the
Passover
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
care
not
what
he
did
,
''
said
Front-de-Boeuf
;
``
the
question
is
,
when
*NL*
shall
I
have
mine
own
?
--
when
shall
I
have
the
shekels

Isaac
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
my
daughter
Rebecca
go
forth
to
York

answered
Isaac
,
``
with
your
*NL*
safe
conduct
,
noble
knight
,
and
so
soon
as
man
and
horse
can
return

treasure

''
Here
he
groaned
deeply
,
but
added
,
after
the
pause
of
a
few
*NL*
seconds
,
--
``
The
treasure
shall
be
told
down
on
this
very
floor

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thy
daughter

said
Front-de-Boeuf
,
as
if
surprised
,
--
``
By
heavens
,
*NL*
Isaac
,
I
would
I
had
known
of
this
.
I
deemed
that
yonder
black-browed
*NL*
girl
had
been
thy
concubine
,
and
I
gave
her
to
be
a
handmaiden
to
Sir
*NL*
Brian
de
Bois-Guilbert
,
after
the
fashion
of
patriarchs
and
heroes
of
*NL*
the
days
of
old
,
who
set
us
in
these
matters
a
wholesome
example

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
yell
which
Isaac
raised
at
this
unfeeling
communication
made
the
*NL*
very
vault
to
ring
,
and
astounded
the
two
Saracens
so
much
that
they
let
*NL*
go
their
hold
of
the
Jew
.
He
availed
himself
of
his
enlargement
to
throw
*NL*
himself
on
the
pavement
,
and
clasp
the
knees
of
Front-de-Boeuf
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
all
that
you
have
asked

he
,

somewhat
relenting

*NL*

Isaac

eager
to

improve
the
moment
of
apparent
sympathy
;

*NL*

Isaac

wringing
his

in
agony

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Front-de-Boeuf

with
sparkling
eyes
,
and
not
*NL*
sorry

perhaps
,
to
seize
a
pretext
for
working
himself
into
a
passion

*NL*

the

retorting
the
insults

oppressor

passion

impotent

he
now
found
it

the

rendered
desperate
by
paternal
affection

Jew

tortures

knew
how
to

disappoint
the
Christian

*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
see
that

said
Front-de-Boeuf
;

In

the
feeble
struggles
of
the
old
man

the
Saracens
had
*NL*
already
torn
from
him
his
upper
garment

were
proceeding
totally
to

disrobe
him
,
when
the
sound

twice
winded
without

*NL*
penetrated
even
to
the
recesses

the
dungeon

immediately

loud
voices

calling

Front-de-Boeuf

Unwilling
to

engaged

his
hellish
occupation

the
savage

Baron
gave
the
slaves
a
signal
to
restore

quitting

the
dungeon

he
left

Two
Gentlemen
of
Verona
*NL*
*NL*
The
apartment
to
which
the
Lady
Rowena
had
been
introduced
was
fitted
*NL*
up
with
some
rude
attempts
at
ornament
and
magnificence
,
and
her
being
*NL*
placed
there
might
be
considered
as
a
peculiar
mark
of
respect
not
*NL*
offered
to
the
other
prisoners
.
But
the
wife
of
Front-de-Boeuf
,
for
whom
*NL*
it
had
been
originally
furnished
,
was
long
dead
,
and
decay
and
neglect
*NL*
had
impaired
the
few
ornaments
with
which
her
taste
had
adorned
it
.
*NL*
The
tapestry
hung
down
from
the
walls
in
many
places
,
and
in
others
*NL*
was
tarnished
and
faded
under
the
effects
of
the
sun
,
or
tattered
and
*NL*
decayed
by
age
.
Desolate
,
however
,
as
it
was
,
this
was
the
apartment
of
*NL*
the
castle
which
had
been
judged
most
fitting
for
the
accommodation
*NL*
of
the
Saxon
heiress
;
and
here
she
was
left
to
meditate
upon
her
fate
,
*NL*
until
the
actors
in
this
nefarious
drama
had
arranged
the
several
parts
*NL*
which
each
of
them
was
to
perform
.
This
had
been
settled
in
a
council
*NL*
held
by
Front-de-Boeuf
,
De
Bracy
,
and
the
Templar
,
in
which
,
after
*NL*
a
long
and
warm
debate
concerning
the
several
advantages
which
each
*NL*
insisted
upon
deriving
from
his
peculiar
share
in
this
audacious
*NL*
enterprise
,
they
had
at
length
determined
the
fate
of
their
unhappy
*NL*
prisoners
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
about
the
hour
of
noon
,
therefore
,
when
De
Bracy
,
for
whose
*NL*
advantage
the
expedition
had
been
first
planned
,
appeared
to
prosecute
*NL*
his
views
upon
the
hand
and
possessions
of
the
Lady
Rowena
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
interval
had
not
entirely
been
bestowed
in
holding
council
with
his
*NL*
confederates
,
for
De
Bracy
had
found
leisure
to
decorate
his
person
*NL*
with
all
the
foppery
of
the
times
.
His
green
cassock
and
vizard
were
*NL*
now
flung
aside
.
His
long
luxuriant
hair
was
trained
to
flow
in
quaint
*NL*
tresses
down
his
richly
furred
cloak
.
His
beard
was
closely
shaved
,
his
*NL*
doublet
reached
to
the
middle
of
his
leg
,
and
the
girdle
which
secured
*NL*
it
,
and
at
the
same
time
supported
his
ponderous
sword
,
was
embroidered
*NL*
and
embossed
with
gold
work
.
We
have
already
noticed
the
extravagant
*NL*
fashion
of
the
shoes
at
this
period
,
and
the
points
of
Maurice
de
*NL*
Bracy
's
might
have
challenged
the
prize
of
extravagance
with
the
gayest
,
*NL*
being
turned
up
and
twisted
like
the
horns
of
a
ram
.
Such
was
the
dress
*NL*
of
a
gallant
of
the
period
;
and
,
in
the
present
instance
,
that
effect
*NL*
was
aided
by
the
handsome
person
and
good
demeanour
of
the
wearer
,
whose
*NL*
manners
partook
alike
of
the
grace
of
a
courtier
,
and
the
frankness
of
a
*NL*
soldier
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
saluted
Rowena
by
doffing
his
velvet
bonnet
,
garnished
with
a
golden
*NL*
broach
,
representing
St
Michael
trampling
down
the
Prince
of
Evil
.
With
*NL*
this
,
he
gently
motioned
the
lady
to
a
seat
;
and
,
as
she
still
retained
*NL*
her
standing
posture
,
the
knight
ungloved
his
right
hand
,
and
motioned
*NL*
to
conduct
her
thither
.
But
Rowena
declined
,
by
her
gesture
,
the
*NL*
proffered
compliment
,
and
replied
,
``
If
I
be
in
the
presence
of
*NL*
my
jailor
,
Sir
Knight
--
nor
will
circumstances
allow
me
to
think
*NL*
otherwise
--
it
best
becomes
his
prisoner
to
remain
standing
till
she
*NL*
learns
her
doom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
!
fair
Rowena
,
''
returned
De
Bracy
,
``
you
are
in
presence
of
your
*NL*
captive
,
not
your
jailor
;
and
it
is
from
your
fair
eyes
that
De
Bracy
*NL*
must
receive
that
doom
which
you
fondly
expect
from
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
you
not
,
sir
,
''
said
the
lady
,
drawing
herself
up
with
all
the
*NL*
pride
of
offended
rank
and
beauty
;
``
I
know
you
not
--
and
the
insolent
*NL*
familiarity
with
which
you
apply
to
me
the
jargon
of
a
troubadour
,
forms
*NL*
no
apology
for
the
violence
of
a
robber
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
thyself
,
fair
maid
,
''
answered
De
Bracy
,
in
his
former
tone
--
``
to
*NL*
thine
own
charms
be
ascribed
whate'er
I
have
done
which
passed
the
*NL*
respect
due
to
her
,
whom
I
have
chosen
queen
of
my
heart
,
and
lodestar
*NL*
of
my
eyes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
repeat
to
you
,
Sir
Knight
,
that
I
know
you
not
,
and
that
no
man
*NL*
wearing
chain
and
spurs
ought
thus
to
intrude
himself
upon
the
presence
*NL*
of
an
unprotected
lady
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
am
unknown
to
you
,
''
said
De
Bracy
,
``
is
indeed
my
misfortune
;
*NL*
yet
let
me
hope
that
De
Bracy
's
name
has
not
been
always
unspoken
,
when
*NL*
minstrels
or
heralds
have
praised
deeds
of
chivalry
,
whether
in
the
*NL*
lists
or
in
the
battle-field
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
heralds
and
to
minstrels
,
then
,
leave
thy
praise
,
Sir
Knight
,
''
*NL*
replied
Rowena
,
``
more
suiting
for
their
mouths
than
for
thine
own
;
and
*NL*
tell
me
which
of
them
shall
record
in
song
,
or
in
book
of
tourney
,
the
*NL*
memorable
conquest
of
this
night
,
a
conquest
obtained
over
an
old
man
,
*NL*
followed
by
a
few
timid
hinds
;
and
its
booty

an
unfortunate
maiden
,
*NL*
transported
against
her
will
to
the
castle
of
a
robber
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
unjust
,
Lady
Rowena
,
''
said
the
knight
,
biting
his
lips
in
*NL*
some
confusion
,
and
speaking
in
a
tone
more
natural
to
him
than
that
of
*NL*
affected
gallantry
,
which
he
had
at
first
adopted
;
``
yourself
free
from
*NL*
passion
,
you
can
allow
no
excuse
for
the
frenzy
of
another

caused
by
your
own
beauty

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
pray
you
,
Sir
Knight

said
Rowena
,
``
to
cease
a
language
so
commonly
*NL*
used

minstrels

*NL*
``

said
De
Bracy

incensed
at
finding
his

procured
him
nothing

contempt

suited
thy

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
``

the
Norman

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
Rowena

said
De

,
``

that
respecting

*NL*
``

Rowena

``
hath
in
its
indifferent
bluntness
*NL*
something

*NL*
*NL*
``
Flatter

De

loves
better

silence

the
pillow

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Cedric
also

said
Rowena
,
repeating
his
words
;
``
my
noble
--
my
*NL*
generous
guardian
!
I
deserved
the
evil
I

*NL*
*NL*
``
Cedric

fate
also
depends
upon
thy

De

;
``

*NL*
I
leave
thee

*NL*
*NL*
Hitherto
,
Rowena
had
sustained
her
part
in
this
trying
scene
with
*NL*
undismayed
courage
,
but
it
was
because
she
had
not
considered
the
*NL*
danger
as
serious
and
imminent
.
Her
disposition
was
naturally
that
which
*NL*
physiognomists
consider
as
proper
to
fair
complexions
,
mild
,
timid
,
*NL*
and
gentle
;
but
it
had
been
tempered
,
and
,
as
it
were
,
hardened
,
by
the
*NL*
circumstances
of
her
education
.
Accustomed
to
see
the
will
of
all
,
even
*NL*
of
Cedric
himself
,
-LRB-
sufficiently
arbitrary
with
others
,
-RRB-
give
way
before
*NL*
her
wishes
,
she
had
acquired
that
sort
of
courage
and
self-confidence
*NL*
which
arises
from
the
habitual
and
constant
deference
of
the
circle
in
*NL*
which
we
move
.
She
could
scarce
conceive
the
possibility
of
her
will
*NL*
being
opposed
,
far
less
that
of
its
being
treated
with
total
disregard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
haughtiness
and
habit
of
domination
was
,
therefore
,
a
fictitious
*NL*
character
,
induced
over
that
which
was
natural
to
her
,
and
it
deserted
*NL*
her
when
her
eyes
were
opened
to
the
extent
of
her
own
danger
,
as
well
*NL*
as
that
of
her
lover
and
her
guardian
;
and
when
she
found
her
will
,
the
*NL*
slightest
expression
of
which
was
wont
to
command
respect
and
attention
,
*NL*
now
placed
in
opposition
to
that
of
a
man
of
a
strong
,
fierce
,
and
*NL*
determined
mind
,
who
possessed
the
advantage
over
her
,
and
was
resolved
*NL*
to
use
it
,
she
quailed
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
casting
her
eyes
around
,
as
if
to
look
for
the
aid
which
was
*NL*
nowhere
to
be
found
,
and
after
a
few
broken
interjections
,
she
raised
*NL*
her
hands
to
heaven
,
and
burst
into
a
passion
of
uncontrolled
vexation
*NL*
and
sorrow
.
It
was
impossible
to
see
so
beautiful
a
creature
in
such
*NL*
extremity
without
feeling
for
her
,
and
De
Bracy
was
not
unmoved
,
though
*NL*
he
was
yet
more
embarrassed
than
touched
.
He
had
,
in
truth
,
gone
too
*NL*
far
to
recede
;
and
yet
,
in
Rowena
's
present
condition
,
she
could
not
be
*NL*
acted
on
either
by
argument
or
threats
.
He
paced
the
apartment
to
and
*NL*
fro
,
now
vainly
exhorting
the
terrified
maiden
to
compose
herself
,
now
*NL*
hesitating
concerning
his
own
line
of
conduct
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
,
thought
he
,
I
should
be
moved
by
the
tears
and
sorrow
of
this
*NL*
disconsolate
damsel
,
what
should
I
reap
but
the
loss
of
these
fair
hopes
*NL*
for
which
I
have
encountered
so
much
risk
,
and
the
ridicule
of
Prince
*NL*
John
and
his
jovial
comrades
?
``
And
yet
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
I
feel
*NL*
myself
ill
framed
for
the
part
which
I
am
playing
.
I
can
not
look
on
so
*NL*
fair
a
face
while
it
is
disturbed
with
agony
,
or
on
those
eyes
when
they
*NL*
are
drowned
in
tears
.
I
would
she
had
retained
her
original
haughtiness
*NL*
of
disposition
,
or
that
I
had
a
larger
share
of
Front-de-Boeuf
's
*NL*
thrice-tempered
hardness
of
heart
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Agitated
by
these
thoughts
,
he
could
only
bid
the
unfortunate
Rowena
be
*NL*
comforted
,
and
assure
her
,
that
as
yet
she
had
no
reason
for
the
*NL*
excess
of
despair
to
which
she
was
now
giving
way
.
But
in
this
task
of
*NL*
consolation
De
Bracy
was
interrupted
by
the
horn
,
``
hoarse-winded
blowing
*NL*
far
and
keen
,
''
which
had
at
the
same
time
alarmed
the
other
inmates
*NL*
of
the
castle
,
and
interrupted
their
several
plans
of
avarice
and
*NL*
of
license
.
Of
them
all
,
perhaps
,
De
Bracy
least
regretted
the
*NL*
interruption
;
for
his
conference
with
the
Lady
Rowena
had
arrived
at
a
*NL*
point
,
where
he
found
it
equally
difficult
to
prosecute
or
to
resign
his
*NL*
enterprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
here
we
can
not
but
think
it
necessary
to
offer
some
better
proof
*NL*
than
the
incidents
of
an
idle
tale
,
to
vindicate
the
melancholy
*NL*
representation
of
manners
which
has
been
just
laid
before
the
reader
.
It
*NL*
is
grievous
to
think
that
those
valiant
barons
,
to
whose
stand
against
*NL*
the
crown
the
liberties
of
England
were
indebted
for
their
existence
,
*NL*
should
themselves
have
been
such
dreadful
oppressors
,
and
capable
of
*NL*
excesses
contrary
not
only
to
the
laws
of
England
,
but
to
those
of
*NL*
nature
and
humanity
.
But
,
alas
!
we
have
only
to
extract
from
the
*NL*
industrious
Henry
one
of
those
numerous
passages
which
he
has
collected
*NL*
from
contemporary
historians
,
to
prove
that
fiction
itself
can
hardly
*NL*
reach
the
dark
reality
of
the
horrors
of
the
period
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
description
given
by
the
author
of
the
Saxon
Chronicle
of
the
*NL*
cruelties
exercised
in
the
reign
of
King
Stephen
by
the
great
barons
and
*NL*
lords
of
castles
,
who
were
all
Normans
,
affords
a
strong
proof
of
the
*NL*
excesses
of
which
they
were
capable
when
their
passions
were
inflamed
.
*NL*
``
They
grievously
oppressed
the
poor
people
by
building
castles
;
and
when
*NL*
they
were
built
,
they
filled
them
with
wicked
men
,
or
rather
devils
,
who
*NL*
seized
both
men
and
women
who
they
imagined
had
any
money
,
threw
them
*NL*
into
prison
,
and
put
them
to
more
cruel
tortures
than
the
martyrs
ever
*NL*
endured
.
They
suffocated
some
in
mud
,
and
suspended
others
by
the
feet
,
*NL*
or
the
head
,
or
the
thumbs
,
kindling
fires
below
them
.
They
squeezed
the
*NL*
heads
of
some
with
knotted
cords
till
they
pierced
their
brains
,
while
*NL*
they
threw
others
into
dungeons
swarming
with
serpents
,
snakes
,
and
*NL*
toads
.
''
But
it
would
be
cruel
to
put
the
reader
to
the
pain
of
perusing
*NL*
the
remainder
of
this
description

As
another
instance
of
these
bitter
fruits
of
conquest
,
and
perhaps
the
*NL*
strongest
that
can
be
quoted
,
we
may
mention
,
that
the
Princess

afterwards

during

to
assume

of
the
Norman
*NL*
nobles
.
This
excuse
she
stated
before
a
great
council
of
the
clergy
of
*NL*
England
,
as
the
sole
reason
for
her
having
taken
the
religious
habit
.
*NL*
The
assembled
clergy
admitted
the
validity
of
the
plea
,
and
the
*NL*
notoriety
of
the
circumstances
upon
which
it
was
founded
;
giving
thus
*NL*
an
indubitable
and
most
remarkable
testimony
to
the
existence
of
that
*NL*
disgraceful
license
by
which
that
age
was
stained
.
It
was
a
matter
of
*NL*
public
knowledge
,
they
said
,
that
after
the
conquest
of
King
William
,
*NL*
his
Norman
followers
,
elated
by
so
great
a
victory
,
acknowledged
no
*NL*
law
but
their
own
wicked
pleasure
,
and
not
only
despoiled
the
conquered
*NL*
Saxons
of
their
lands
and
their
goods
,
but
invaded
the
honour
of
their
*NL*
wives
and
of
their
daughters
with
the
most
unbridled
license
;
and
hence
*NL*
it
was
then
common
for
matrons
and
maidens
of
noble
families
to
assume
*NL*
the
veil
,
and
take
shelter
in
convents
,
not
as
called
thither
by
the
*NL*
vocation
of
God
,
but
solely
to
preserve
their
honour
from
the
unbridled
*NL*
wickedness
of
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
and
so
licentious
were
the
times
,
as
announced
by
the
public
*NL*
declaration
of
the
assembled
clergy
,
recorded
by
Eadmer
;
and
we
need
add
*NL*
nothing
more
to
vindicate
the
probability
of
the
scenes
which
we
have
*NL*
detailed
,
and
are
about
to
detail
,
upon
the
more
apocryphal
authority
of
*NL*
the
Wardour
MS.

CHAPTER
XXIV
*NL*
*NL*
I
'll
woo
her
as
the
lion
woos
his
bride
.

Douglas
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
scenes
we
have
described
were
passing
in
other
parts
of
the
*NL*
castle
,
the
Jewess
Rebecca
awaited
her
fate
in
a
distant
and
sequestered
*NL*
turret
.
Hither
she
had
been
led
by
two
of
her
disguised
ravishers
,
and
*NL*
on
being
thrust
into
the
little
cell
,
she
found
herself
in
the
presence
*NL*
of
an
old
sibyl
,
who
kept
murmuring
to
herself
a
Saxon
rhyme
,
as
if
to
*NL*
beat
time
to
the
revolving
dance
which
her
spindle
was
performing
upon
*NL*
the
floor
.
The
hag
raised
her
head
as
Rebecca
entered
,
and
scowled
at
*NL*
the
fair
Jewess
with
the
malignant
envy
with
which
old
age
and
ugliness
,
*NL*
when
united
with
evil
conditions
,
are
apt
to
look
upon
youth
and
beauty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
must
up
and
away
,
old
house-cricket
,
''
said
one
of
the
men
;
``
our
*NL*
noble
master
commands
it
--
Thou
must
e
`
en
leave
this
chamber
to
a
fairer
*NL*
guest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
''
grumbled
the
hag
,
``
even
thus
is
service
requited
.
I
have
known
*NL*
when
my
bare
word
would
have
cast
the
best
man-at-arms
among
ye
out
of
*NL*
saddle
and
out
of
service
;
and
now
must
I
up
and
away
at
the
command
of
*NL*
every
groom
such
as
thou
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
Dame
Urfried
,
''
said
the
other
man
,
``
stand
not
to
reason
on
it
,
*NL*
but
up
and
away

hests

a
quick
ear
.
Thou
*NL*
hast
had
thy
day
,
old
dame
,
but
thy
sun
has
long
been
set

Thou
art
now
*NL*
the
very
emblem
of
an
old
war-horse
turned
out
on
the
barren
heath
--
thou
*NL*
hast
had
thy
paces
in
thy
time
,
but
now
a
broken
amble

the
best
of

off
with
thee

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ill
omens

ye
both

said
the
old
woman
;
``
and
a
kennel
be
your
*NL*
burying-place

May
the
evil
demon
Zernebock
tear
me
limb
from

out

*NL*
*NL*
``
Answer
it
to
our
lord
,
then
,
old
housefiend

said
the
man
,
and
*NL*
retired
;
leaving
Rebecca
in
company
with
the
old
woman
,
upon
whose
*NL*
presence
she
had
been
thus
unwillingly
forced
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
devil
's
deed
have
they
now
in
the
wind
?
''
said
the
old
hag
,
*NL*
murmuring
to
herself
,
yet
from
time
to
time
casting
a
sidelong
and
*NL*
malignant
glance
at
Rebecca
;
``
but
it
is
easy
to
guess
--
Bright
eyes
,
*NL*
black
locks
,
and
a
skin
like
paper
,
ere
the
priest
stains
it
with
his
*NL*
black
unguent
--
Ay
,
it
is
easy
to
guess
why
they
send
her
to
this
lone
*NL*
turret
,
whence
a
shriek
could
no
more
be
heard
than
at
the
depth
of
*NL*
five
hundred
fathoms
beneath
the
earth
.
--
Thou
wilt
have
owls
for
thy
*NL*
neighbours
,
fair
one
;
and
their
screams
will
be
heard
as
far
,
and
as
*NL*
much
regarded
,
as
thine
own
.
Outlandish
,
too
,
''
she
said
,
marking
the
*NL*
dress
and
turban
of
Rebecca
--
``
What
country
art
thou
of

--
a
Saracen

*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
not

said
Rebecca
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou

replied
Urfried
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
the

of

said
Rebecca
,
``
tell
me
what
I
am
to
expect

the
conclusion

violence

hither

my

I
will
lay
it
down

cheerfully

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thy

answered
the
sibyl
;
``
what
would

Trust
me

thy

Such

thou
*NL*

as
was
once
thought
good
enough

a
noble
Saxon
maiden

And
shall
*NL*
a
Jewess
,
like
thee
,
repine
because
she
hath
no
better
?
Look
at
me
--
I
*NL*
was
as
young
and
twice
as
fair
as
thou
,
when
Front-de-Boeuf
,
father
of
*NL*
this
Reginald
,
and
his
Normans
,
stormed
this
castle
.
My
father
and
his
*NL*
seven
sons
defended
their
inheritance
from
story
to
story
,
from
chamber
*NL*
to
chamber
--
There
was
not
a
room
,
not
a
step
of
the
stair
,
that
was
not
*NL*
slippery
with
their
blood
.
They
died
--
they
died
every
man
;
and
ere
their
*NL*
bodies
were
cold
,
and
ere
their
blood
was
dried
,
I
had
become
the
prey
*NL*
and
the
scorn
of
the
conqueror
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
no
help
?
--
Are
there
no
means
of
escape
?
''
said
*NL*
Rebecca
--
``
Richly
,
richly
would
I
requite
thine
aid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Think
not
of
it
,
''
said
the
hag
;
``
from
hence
there
is
no
escape
but
*NL*
through
the
gates
of
death
;
and
it
is
late
,
late
,
''
she
added
,
shaking
*NL*
her
grey
head
,
``
ere
these
open
to
us
--
Yet
it
is
comfort
to
think
that
we
*NL*
leave
behind
us
on
earth
those
who
shall
be
wretched
as
ourselves
.
Fare
*NL*
thee
well
,
Jewess
!
--
Jew
or
Gentile
,
thy
fate
would
be
the
same
;
for
thou
*NL*
hast
to
do
with
them
that
have
neither
scruple
nor
pity
.
Fare
thee
well
,
*NL*
I
say
.
My
thread
is
spun
out
--
thy
task
is
yet
to
begin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
!
stay
!
for
Heaven
's
sake
!
''
said
Rebecca
;
``
stay
,
though
it
be
to
*NL*
curse
and
to
revile
me
--
thy
presence
is
yet
some
protection
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
presence
of
the
mother
of
God
were
no
protection
,
''
answered
the
old
*NL*
woman
.
``
There
she
stands
,
''
pointing
to
a
rude
image
of
the
Virgin
Mary
,
*NL*
``
see
if
she
can
avert
the
fate
that
awaits
thee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
left
the
room
as
she
spoke
,
her
features
writhed
into
a
sort
of
*NL*
sneering
laugh
,
which
made
them
seem
even
more
hideous
than
their
*NL*
habitual
frown
.
She
locked
the
door
behind
her
,
and
Rebecca
might
hear
*NL*
her
curse
every
step
for
its
steepness
,
as
slowly
and
with
difficulty
*NL*
she
descended
the
turret-stair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rebecca
was
now
to
expect
a
fate
even
more
dreadful
than
that
of
Rowena
;
*NL*
for
what
probability
was
there
that
either
softness
or
ceremony
would
be
*NL*
used
towards
one
of
her
oppressed
race
,
whatever
shadow
of
these
might
*NL*
be
preserved
towards
a
Saxon
heiress
?
Yet
had
the
Jewess
this
advantage
,
*NL*
that
she
was
better
prepared
by
habits
of
thought
,
and
by
natural
*NL*
strength
of
mind
,
to
encounter
the
dangers
to
which
she
was
exposed
.
Of
*NL*
a
strong
and
observing
character
,
even
from
her
earliest
years
,
the
pomp
*NL*
and
wealth
which
her
father
displayed
within
his
walls
,
or
which
she
*NL*
witnessed
in
the
houses
of
other
wealthy
Hebrews
,
had
not
been
able
to
*NL*
blind
her
to
the
precarious
circumstances
under
which
they
were
enjoyed
.
*NL*
Like
Damocles
at
his
celebrated
banquet
,
Rebecca
perpetually
beheld
,
*NL*
amid
that
gorgeous
display
,
the
sword
which
was
suspended
over
the
heads
*NL*
of
her
people
by
a
single
hair
.
These
reflections
had
tamed
and
brought
*NL*
down
to
a
pitch
of
sounder
judgment
a
temper
,
which
,
under
other
*NL*
circumstances
,
might
have
waxed
haughty
,
supercilious
,
and
obstinate
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
her
father
's
example
and
injunctions
,
Rebecca
had
learnt
to
bear
*NL*
herself
courteously
towards
all
who
approached
her
.
She
could
not
indeed
*NL*
imitate
his
excess
of
subservience
,
because
she
was
a
stranger
to
the
*NL*
meanness
of
mind
,
and
to
the
constant
state
of
timid
apprehension
,
by
*NL*
which
it
was
dictated
;
but
she
bore
herself
with
a
proud
humility
,
as
*NL*
if
submitting
to
the
evil
circumstances
in
which
she
was
placed
as
*NL*
the
daughter
of
a
despised
race
,
while
she
felt
in
her
mind
the
*NL*
consciousness
that
she
was
entitled
to
hold
a
higher
rank
from
her
*NL*
merit
,
than
the
arbitrary
despotism
of
religious
prejudice
permitted
her
*NL*
to
aspire
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
prepared
to
expect
adverse
circumstances
,
she
had
acquired
the
*NL*
firmness
necessary
for
acting
under
them
.
Her
present
situation
required
*NL*
all
her
presence
of
mind
,
and
she
summoned
it
up
accordingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
first
care
was
to
inspect
the
apartment
;
but
it
afforded
few
hopes
*NL*
either
of
escape
or
protection
.
It
contained
neither
secret
passage
nor
*NL*
trap-door
,
and
unless
where
the
door
by
which
she
had
entered
joined
the
*NL*
main
building
,
seemed
to
be
circumscribed
by
the
round
exterior
wall
of
*NL*
the
turret
.
The
door
had
no
inside
bolt
or
bar
.
The
single
window
opened
*NL*
upon
an
embattled
space
surmounting
the
turret
,
which
gave
Rebecca
,
*NL*
at
first
sight
,
some
hopes
of
escaping
;
but
she
soon
found
it
had
no
*NL*
communication
with
any
other
part
of
the
battlements
,
being
an
isolated
*NL*
bartisan
,
or
balcony
,
secured
,
as
usual
,
by
a
parapet
,
with
embrasures
,
*NL*
at
which
a
few
archers
might
be
stationed
for
defending
the
turret
,
and
*NL*
flanking
with
their
shot
the
wall
of
the
castle
on
that
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
therefore
no
hope
but
in
passive
fortitude
,
and
in
that
strong
*NL*
reliance
on
Heaven
natural
to
great
and
generous
characters
.
Rebecca
,
*NL*
however
erroneously
taught
to
interpret
the
promises
of
Scripture
to
*NL*
the
chosen
people
of
Heaven
,
did
not
err
in
supposing
the
present
to
be
*NL*
their
hour
of
trial
,
or
in
trusting
that
the
children
of
Zion
would
be
*NL*
one
day
called
in
with
the
fulness
of
the
Gentiles
.
In
the
meanwhile
,
*NL*
all
around
her
showed
that
their
present
state
was
that
of
punishment
*NL*
and
probation
,
and
that
it
was
their
especial
duty
to
suffer
without
*NL*
sinning
.
Thus
prepared
to
consider
herself
as
the
victim
of
misfortune
,
*NL*
Rebecca
had
early
reflected
upon
her
own
state
,
and
schooled
her
mind
to
*NL*
meet
the
dangers
which
she
had
probably
to
encounter
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prisoner
trembled
,
however
,
and
changed
colour
,
when
a
step
was
*NL*
heard
on
the
stair
,
and
the
door
of
the
turret-chamber
slowly
opened
,
*NL*
and
a
tall
man
,
dressed
as
one
of
those
banditti
to
whom
they
owed
*NL*
their
misfortune
,
slowly
entered
,
and
shut
the
door
behind
him
;
his
cap
,
*NL*
pulled
down
upon
his
brows
,
concealed
the
upper
part
of
his
face
,
and
he
*NL*
held
his
mantle
in
such
a
manner
as
to
muffle
the
rest
.
In
this
guise
,
*NL*
as
if
prepared
for
the
execution
of
some
deed
,
at
the
thought
of
which
*NL*
he
was
himself
ashamed
,
he
stood
before
the
affrighted
prisoner
;
yet
,
*NL*
ruffian
as
his
dress
bespoke
him
,
he
seemed
at
a
loss
to
express
what
*NL*
purpose
had
brought
him
thither
,
so
that
Rebecca
,
making
an
effort
*NL*
upon
herself
,
had
time
to
anticipate
his
explanation
.
She
had
already
*NL*
unclasped
two
costly
bracelets
and
a
collar
,
which
she
hastened
to
*NL*
proffer
to
the
supposed
outlaw
,
concluding
naturally
that
to
gratify
his
*NL*
avarice
was
to
bespeak
his
favour
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
these
,
''
she
said
,
``
good
friend
,
and
for
God
's
sake
be
merciful
*NL*
to
me
and
my
aged
father
!
These
ornaments
are
of
value
,
yet
are
they
*NL*
trifling
to
what
he
would
bestow
to
obtain
our
dismissal
from
this
*NL*
castle
,
free
and
uninjured
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fair
flower
of
Palestine
,
''
replied
the
outlaw
,
``
these
pearls
are
*NL*
orient
,
but
they
yield
in
whiteness
to
your
teeth
;
the
diamonds
are
*NL*
brilliant
,
but
they
can
not
match
your
eyes
;
and
ever
since
I
have
taken
*NL*
up
this
wild

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
do
yourself
such
wrong

said
Rebecca
;
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
well
spoken

''
replied
the
outlaw
in
French
,
finding
it
difficult
*NL*
probably
to
sustain
,
in
Saxon
,
a
conversation
which
Rebecca
had
opened
*NL*
in
that
language
;
``
but
know
,
bright
lily

the
vale
of
Baca

that
thy
*NL*
father
is
already
in

a
powerful
alchemist
,
who
knows
how
to
*NL*
convert
into
gold
and
silver
even
the
rusty
bars
of
a
dungeon
grate
.
The
*NL*
venerable
Isaac
is
subjected
to
an
alembic

will
distil
from
*NL*
him
all
he
holds
dear

without
any
assistance
from
my
requests

thy

entreaty

The
ransom

be
paid
by
love

in
no
other

coin
will
I
accept
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
art
no
outlaw

said
Rebecca
,
in
the
same
language
in
which
he
*NL*
addressed
her
;
``
no

refused

No

*NL*
``

Brian

dropping
the

Rebecca
;

*NL*
*NL*
``
It

gravely

O

answered
the
*NL*
Templar
;
``
but
,
gentle
Ecclesiastics

thy

thee
blind

an

the
part

folly
I
may
practise
,
I
shall
*NL*
speedily
be
absolved
from
at

wider
privileges
than
we
poor
soldiers

Temple

won
by

*NL*

the

*NL*
*NL*
The
eyes
of
the
Templar
flashed
fire
at
this
reproof

``
Hearken

he

said
,
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
art
keen-witted

Jewess

''
replied
the
Templar
,
well
aware
of
the
*NL*
truth
of
what
she
spoke
,
and
that
the
rules
of
his
Order
condemned
in
*NL*
the
most
positive
manner
,
and
under
high
penalties
,
such
intrigues
as
*NL*
he
now
prosecuted
,
and
that
,
in
some
instances
,
even
degradation
had
*NL*
followed
upon
it
--
``
thou
art
sharp-witted
,
''
he
said
;
``
but
loud
must
be
*NL*
thy
voice

castle

within
these

murmurs

laments

appeals

justice

screams

alike
silent
away

Rebecca

*NL*
Submit
to
thy

embrace
our
religion

thou
shalt
go
forth
in
*NL*
such
state
,
that
many
a
Norman
lady
shall
yield
as
well
in
pomp
as
in
*NL*
beauty
to
the
favourite
of
the
best
lance
among
the
defenders
of
the
*NL*
Temple
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Submit
to
my

said
Rebecca
--
``

Heaven

to

fate

at

The
God
of

Abraham
's
promise
hath
opened
an
escape
to
his
daughter
--
even
from
this
*NL*
abyss
of
infamy

''
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
spoke
,
she
threw
open
the
latticed
window
which
led
to
the
*NL*
bartisan
,
and
in
an
instant
after
,
stood
on
the
very
verge
of
the
*NL*
parapet
,
with
not
the
slightest
screen
between
her
and
the
tremendous
*NL*
depth
below
.
Unprepared
for
such
a
desperate
effort
,
for
she
had
*NL*
hitherto
stood
perfectly
motionless
,
Bois-Guilbert
had
neither
time
*NL*
to
intercept
nor
to
stop
her
.
As
he
offered
to
advance
,
she
exclaimed
,
*NL*
``
Remain
where
thou
art
,
proud
Templar
,
or
at
thy
choice
advance
!
--
one
*NL*
foot
nearer
,
and
I
plunge
myself
from
the
precipice
;
my
body
shall
*NL*
be
crushed
out
of
the
very
form
of
humanity
upon
the
stones
of
that
*NL*
court-yard
,
ere
it
become
the
victim
of
thy
brutality
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
spoke
this
,
she
clasped
her
hands
and
extended
them
towards
*NL*
heaven
,
as
if
imploring
mercy
on
her
soul
before
she
made
the
final
*NL*
plunge
.
The
Templar
hesitated
,
and
a
resolution
which
had
never
yielded
*NL*
to
pity
or
distress
,
gave
way
to
his
admiration
of
her
fortitude
.
``
Come
*NL*
down
,
''
he
said
,
``
rash
girl
!

*NL*
``

Rebecca

better

Preceptory

would
grant
thee
absolution
for
an
oath

the
keeping
of

concerned
*NL*
nought

the
honour

the
dishonour
of
a
miserable
Jewish
maiden

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
me
injustice

exclaimed
the
Templar
fervently
;
``

*NL*
``
Alas

Rebecca

*NL*
``

be
reversed

said
Brian
de

Bois-Guilbert
,
``

shalt
have
reason

complain

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
then
trust
thee

''
said
Rebecca
,
``
thus
far
;
''
and
she
descended
*NL*
from
the
verge
of
the
battlement
,
but
remained
standing
close
by
one
of
*NL*
the
embrasures
,
or
``
machicolles
''
,
as
they
were
then
called
.

``
Here

she
*NL*
said
,
``

take
my

shalt
attempt
*NL*
to
diminish
by
one
step
the
distance
now
between

,
thou
shalt
see
that
*NL*
the
Jewish
maiden
will
rather
trust
her
soul
with
God
,
than
her
honour
*NL*
to
the
Templar
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
Rebecca
spoke
thus
,
her
high
and
firm
resolve
,
which
corresponded
*NL*
so
well
with
the
expressive
beauty
of
her
countenance
,
gave
to
her
*NL*
looks
,
air
,
and
manner
,
a
dignity
that
seemed
more
than
mortal
.
Her
*NL*
glance
quailed
not
,
her
cheek
blanched
not
,
for
the
fear
of
a
fate
so
*NL*
instant
and
so
horrible
;
on
the
contrary
,
the
thought
that
she
had
her
*NL*
fate
at
her
command
,
and
could
escape
at
will
from
infamy
to
death
,
*NL*
gave
a
yet
deeper
colour
of
carnation
to
her
complexion
,
and
a
yet
*NL*
more
brilliant
fire
to
her
eye
.
Bois-Guilbert
,
proud
himself
and
*NL*
high-spirited
,
thought
he
had
never
beheld
beauty
so
animated
and
so
*NL*
commanding
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
there
be
peace
between
us

Rebecca

he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Peace

thou
wilt

answered
Rebecca

``

with
this
space
*NL*
between

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
needst
no
longer
fear
me

''
said
Bois-Guilbert
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
fear
thee
not

''
replied
she
;
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

cruelty

exercised
it

not
upon

me

Rebecca
--
Never
did

take
lance
in
his
hand
with
a
heart
more
*NL*
devoted
to
the
lady
of
his
love

Brian
de
Bois-Guilbert
.
She
,
the
*NL*
daughter
of
a
petty
baron
,
who
boasted
for
all
his
domains
but
a
ruinous
*NL*
tower
,
and
an
unproductive
vineyard
,
and
some
few
leagues
of
the
barren
*NL*
Landes
of
Bourdeaux
,
her
name
was
known
wherever
deeds
of
arms
were
*NL*
done
,
known
wider
than
that
of
many
a
lady
's
that
had
a
county
for
a
*NL*
dowery
.
--
Yes
,
''
he
continued
,
pacing
up
and
down
the
little
platform
,
*NL*
with
an
animation
in
which
he
seemed
to
lose
all
consciousness
of
*NL*
Rebecca
's
presence
--
``
Yes
,
my
deeds
,
my
danger

my

made
the
name

of
Adelaide
de
Montemare
known
from
the
court
of
Castile
to
that
of
*NL*
Byzantium
.
And
how
was
I
requited
?
--
When
I
returned
with
my
dear-bought
*NL*
honours
,
purchased
by
toil
and
blood
,
I
found
her
wedded
to
a
Gascon
*NL*
squire
,
whose
name
was
never
heard
beyond
the
limits
of
his
own
paltry
*NL*
domain

Truly
did
I
love
her

and
bitterly
did
I
revenge
me
of
her
*NL*
broken
faith
!
But
my
vengeance
has
recoiled
on
myself
.
Since
that
day
*NL*
I
have
separated
myself
from
life
and
its
ties
--
My
manhood
must
know
no
*NL*
domestic
home
--
must
be
soothed
by
no
affectionate
wife
--
My
age
must
*NL*
know
no
kindly
hearth
--
My
grave
must
be
solitary
,
and
no
offspring
must
*NL*
outlive
me
,
to
bear
the
ancient
name
of
Bois-Guilbert
.
At
the
feet
of
*NL*
my
Superior
I
have
laid
down
the
right
of
self-action
--
the
privilege
*NL*
of
independence
.
The
Templar
,
a
serf
in
all
but
the
name
,
can
possess
*NL*
neither
lands
nor
goods
,
and
lives
,
moves
,
and
breathes
,
but
at
the
will
*NL*
and
pleasure
of
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
!
''
said
Rebecca
,
``
what
advantages
could
compensate
for
such
an
*NL*
absolute
sacrifice
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
power
of
vengeance
,
Rebecca
,
''
replied
the
Templar
,
``
and
the
*NL*
prospects
of
ambition
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
evil
recompense
,
''
said
Rebecca
,
``
for
the
surrender
of
the
rights
*NL*
which
are
dearest
to
humanity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
not
so
,
maiden
,
''
answered
the
Templar
;
``
revenge
is
a
feast
for
the
*NL*
gods
!
And
if
they
have
reserved
it
,
as
priests
tell
us
,
to
themselves
,
*NL*
it
is
because
they
hold
it
an
enjoyment
too
precious
for
the
possession
*NL*
of
mere
mortals
.
--
And
ambition
?
it
is
a
temptation
which
could
disturb
*NL*
even
the
bliss
of
heaven
itself
.
''
--
He
paused
a
moment
,
and
then
added
,
*NL*
``
Rebecca
!
she
who
could
prefer
death
to
dishonour
,
must
have
a
proud
and
*NL*
a
powerful
soul
.
Mine
thou
must
be
!
--
Nay
,
start
not
,
''
he
added
,
``
it
must
*NL*
be
with
thine
own
consent
,
and
on
thine
own
terms
.
Thou
must
consent
to
*NL*
share
with
me
hopes
more
extended
than
can
be
viewed
from
the
throne
*NL*
of
a
monarch
!
--
Hear
me
ere
you
answer
and
judge
ere
you
refuse
.
--
The
*NL*
Templar
loses
,
as
thou
hast
said
,
his
social
rights
,
his
power
of
free
*NL*
agency
,
but
he
becomes
a
member
and
a
limb
of
a
mighty
body
,
before
*NL*
which
thrones
already
tremble
,
--
even
as
the
single
drop
of
rain
which
*NL*
mixes
with
the
sea
becomes
an
individual
part
of
that
resistless
ocean
,
*NL*
which
undermines
rocks
and
ingulfs
royal
armadas
.
Such
a
swelling
flood
*NL*
is
that
powerful
league
.
Of
this
mighty
Order
I
am
no
mean
member
,
but
*NL*
already
one
of
the
Chief
Commanders
,
and
may
well
aspire
one
day
to
hold
*NL*
the
batoon
of
Grand
Master
.
The
poor
soldiers
of
the
Temple
will
not
*NL*
alone
place
their
foot
upon
the
necks
of
kings
--
a
hemp-sandall
'd
monk
*NL*
can
do
that
.
Our
mailed
step
shall
ascend
their
throne
--
our
gauntlet
*NL*
shall
wrench
the
sceptre
from
their
gripe
.
Not
the
reign
of
your
*NL*
vainly-expected
Messiah
offers
such
power
to
your
dispersed
tribes
as
my
*NL*
ambition
may
aim
at
.
I
have
sought
but
a
kindred
spirit
to
share
it
,
and
*NL*
I
have
found
such
in
thee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sayest
thou
this
to
one
of
my
people
?
''
answered
Rebecca
.
``
Bethink
*NL*
thee
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Answer
me
not
,
''
said
the
Templar
,
``
by
urging
the
difference
of
our
*NL*
creeds
;
within
our
secret
conclaves
we
hold
these
nursery
tales
in
*NL*
derision
.
Think
not
we
long
remained
blind
to
the
idiotical
folly
of
our
*NL*
founders
,
who
forswore
every
delight
of
life
for
the
pleasure
of
dying
*NL*
martyrs
by
hunger
,
by
thirst
,
and
by
pestilence
,
and
by
the
swords
of
*NL*
savages
,
while
they
vainly
strove
to
defend
a
barren
desert
,
valuable
*NL*
only
in
the
eyes
of
superstition
.
Our
Order
soon
adopted
bolder
and
*NL*
wider
views
,
and
found
out
a
better
indemnification
for
our
sacrifices
.
*NL*
Our
immense
possessions
in
every
kingdom
of
Europe
,
our
high
military
*NL*
fame
,
which
brings
within
our
circle
the
flower
of
chivalry
from
every
*NL*
Christian
clime
--
these
are
dedicated
to
ends
of
which
our
pious
founders
*NL*
little
dreamed
,
and
which
are
equally
concealed
from
such
weak
spirits
*NL*
as
embrace
our
Order
on
the
ancient
principles
,
and
whose
superstition
*NL*
makes
them
our
passive
tools
.
But
I
will
not
further
withdraw
the
veil
*NL*
of
our
mysteries
.
That
bugle-sound
announces
something
which
may
require
*NL*
my
presence
.
Think
on
what
I
have
said
.
--
Farewell
!
--
I
do
not
say
forgive
*NL*
me
the
violence
I
have
threatened
,
for
it
was
necessary
to
the
display
*NL*
of
thy
character
.
Gold
can
be
only
known
by
the
application
of
the
*NL*
touchstone
.
I
will
soon
return
,
and
hold
further
conference
with
thee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
re-entered
the
turret-chamber
,
and
descended
the
stair
,
leaving
*NL*
Rebecca
scarcely
more
terrified
at
the
prospect
of
the
death
to
which
*NL*
she
had
been
so
lately
exposed
,
than
at
the
furious
ambition
of
the
bold
*NL*
bad
man
in
whose
power
she
found
herself
so
unhappily
placed
.
When
she
*NL*
entered
the
turret-chamber
,
her
first
duty
was
to
return
thanks
to
*NL*
the
God
of
Jacob
for
the
protection
which
he
had
afforded
her
,
and
to
*NL*
implore
its
continuance
for
her
and
for
her
father
.
Another
name
glided
*NL*
into
her
petition
--
it
was
that
of
the
wounded
Christian
,
whom
fate
had
*NL*
placed
in
the
hands
of
bloodthirsty
men
,
his
avowed
enemies
.
Her
heart
*NL*
indeed
checked
her
,
as
if
,
even
in
communing
with
the
Deity
in
prayer
,
*NL*
she
mingled
in
her
devotions
the
recollection
of
one
with
whose
fate
*NL*
hers
could
have
no
alliance
--
a
Nazarene
,
and
an
enemy
to
her
faith
.
But
*NL*
the
petition
was
already
breathed
,
nor
could
all
the
narrow
prejudices
*NL*
of
her
sect
induce
Rebecca
to
wish
it
recalled
.

When
the
Templar
reached
the
hall
of
the
castle
,
he
found
De
Bracy
*NL*
already
there
.
``
Your
love-suit
,
''
said
De
Bracy
,
``
hath
,
I
suppose
,
been
*NL*
disturbed
,
like
mine
,
by
this
obstreperous
summons
.
But
you
have
come
*NL*
later
and
more
reluctantly
,
and
therefore
I
presume
your
interview
has
*NL*
proved
more
agreeable
than
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
your
suit
,
then
,
been
unsuccessfully
paid
to
the
Saxon
heiress
?
''
*NL*
said
the
Templar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
bones
of
Thomas
a
Becket
,
''
answered
De
Bracy
,
``
the
Lady
Rowena
*NL*
must
have
heard
that
I
can
not
endure
the
sight
of
women
's
tears
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Away
!
''
said
the
Templar
;
``
thou
a
leader
of
a
Free
Company
,
and
regard
*NL*
a
woman
's
tears
!
A
few
drops
sprinkled
on
the
torch
of
love
,
make
the
*NL*
flame
blaze
the
brighter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gramercy
for
the
few
drops
of
thy
sprinkling
,
''
replied
De
Bracy
;
``
but
*NL*
this
damsel
hath
wept
enough
to
extinguish
a
beacon-light
.
Never
was
*NL*
such
wringing
of
hands
and
such
overflowing
of
eyes
,
since
the
days
of
*NL*
St
Niobe
,
of
whom
Prior
Aymer
told
us

*NL*
*NL*
``
A
legion
of
fiends
have
occupied
the
bosom
of

Jewess

''
replied
the
*NL*
Templar
;
``
for
,
I
think
no
single
one
,
not
even
Apollyon

,
could
*NL*
have
inspired
such
indomitable
pride
and
resolution
.

But
where
is
*NL*
Front-de-Boeuf
?
That
horn
is
sounded
more
and
more
clamorously
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
negotiating
with
the
Jew
,
I
suppose
,
''
replied
De
Bracy
,
coolly
;
*NL*
``
probably
the
howls
of
Isaac
have
drowned
the
blast
of
the
bugle

*NL*
Thou
mayst
know
,
by
experience
,
Sir
Brian
,
that
a
Jew
parting
with
his
*NL*
treasures
on
such
terms
as
our
friend
Front-de-Boeuf
is
like
to
offer
,
*NL*
will
raise
a
clamour
loud
enough
to
be
heard
over
twenty
horns
and
*NL*
trumpets
to
boot
.
But
we
will
make
the
vassals
call
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
soon
after
joined
by
Front-de-Boeuf
,
who
had
been
disturbed
in
*NL*
his
tyrannic
cruelty
in
the
manner
with
which
the
reader
is
acquainted
,
*NL*
and
had
only
tarried
to
give
some
necessary
directions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
see
the
cause
of
this
cursed
clamour
,
''
said
*NL*
Front-de-Boeuf
--
``
here
is
a
letter
,
and
,
if
I
mistake
not
,
it
is
in
*NL*
Saxon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
it
,
turning
it
round
and
round
as
if
he
had
had
really
some
*NL*
hopes
of
coming
at
the
meaning
by
inverting
the
position
of
the
paper
,
*NL*
and
then
handed
it
to
De
Bracy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
may
be
magic
spells
for
aught
I
know
,
''
said
De
Bracy
,
who
possessed
*NL*
his
full
proportion
of
the
ignorance
which
characterised
the
chivalry
of
*NL*
the
period
.
``
Our
chaplain
attempted
to
teach
me
to
write
,
''
he
said
,
``
but
*NL*
all
my
letters
were
formed
like
spear-heads
and
sword-blades
,
and
so
the
*NL*
old
shaveling
gave
up
the
task
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
it
me
,
''
said
the
Templar
.
``
We
have
that
of
the
priestly
character
,
*NL*
that
we
have
some
knowledge
to
enlighten
our
valour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
profit
by
your
most
reverend
knowledge
,
then
,
''
said
De
Bracy
;
*NL*
``
what
says
the
scroll
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
formal
letter
of
defiance
,
''
answered
the
Templar
;
``
but
,
by
*NL*
our
Lady
of
Bethlehem
,
if
it
be
not
a
foolish
jest
,
it
is

most
*NL*
extraordinary
cartel
that
ever
was
sent
across
the
drawbridge
of

baronial
castle

*NL*
*NL*
``

Front-de-Boeuf

gladly

a

Read
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Templar
accordingly
read
it
as
follows
:

``

``

Noir
Faineant

And
,
to
conclude
the
whole
,
an
arrow
,
neatly
enough
*NL*
drawn
,
was
described
as
the
mark
of
the
yeoman
Locksley
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
knights
heard
this
uncommon
document
read
from
end
to
end
,
and
then
*NL*
gazed
upon
each
other
in
silent
amazement
,
as
being
utterly
at
a
loss
to
*NL*
know
what
it
could
portend
.
De
Bracy
was
the
first
to
break
silence
by
*NL*
an
uncontrollable
fit
of
laughter
,
wherein
he
was
joined
,
though
with
*NL*
more
moderation
,
by
the
Templar
.
Front-de-Boeuf
,
on
the
contrary
,
seemed
*NL*
impatient
of
their
ill-timed
jocularity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
give
you
plain
warning
,
''
he
said
,
``
fair
sirs
,
that
you
had
better
*NL*
consult
how
to
bear
yourselves
under
these
circumstances
,
than
give
way
*NL*
to
such
misplaced
merriment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Front-de-Boeuf
has
not
recovered
his
temper
since
his
late
overthrow
,
''
*NL*
said
De
Bracy
to
the
Templar
;
``
he
is
cowed
at
the
very
idea
of
a
cartel

*NL*
though

come
but
from
a
fool

a
swineherd
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
St
Michael

''
answered
Front-de-Boeuf
,
``
I
would
thou
couldst
stand
*NL*
the
whole
brunt
of
this
adventure
thyself

De
Bracy

These
fellows
dared
*NL*
not
have
acted
with
such
inconceivable
impudence
,
had
they
not
been
*NL*
supported
by
some
strong
bands

There
are
enough
of
outlaws
in
this
*NL*
forest
to
resent
my
protecting
the
deer
.
I
did
but
tie
one
fellow
,
who
*NL*
was
taken
redhanded
and
in
the
fact
,
to
the
horns
of
a
wild
stag
,
which
*NL*
gored
him
to
death
in
five
minutes
,
and
I
had
as
many
arrows
shot
at
me

there
were
launched
against
yonder
target
at
Ashby

*NL*
he
added
,
to
one
of
his
attendants
,
``

thou
sent
out

this
precious
challenge

*NL*
``
There
are
at

two
hundred

a
*NL*
squire
who
was
in
attendance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
is
a
proper
matter
!

said
Front-de-Boeuf
,
``

comes
of

*NL*
*NL*
``
Of

De

*NL*
*NL*
``
Stingless

replied
Front-de-Boeuf
;
``

shafts
of
a
cloth-yard

these
shot
within

*NL*

the
Templar

Let

summon
our

*NL*
``
Enough

De

I

*NL*
*NL*

Front-de-Boeuf
;

Turks

*NL*

*NL*
``

Front-de-Boeuf

the

*NL*

Front-de-Boeuf

he

added

after
pausing
for
a
moment

the

*NL*
*NL*

Front-de-Boeuf

Templar

thou
shalt
return
an
answer

bold
challenge

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
rather
do
it
at
the
sword

point
than
at
that
of
the
pen

*NL*
said
Bois-Guilbert
;
``
but
be
it
as
you
will

*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
down
accordingly
,
and
indited
,
in
the
French
language
,
an
epistle
*NL*
of
the
following
tenor
:
--
``
Sir
Reginald
Front-de-Boeuf
,
with
his
noble
*NL*
and
knightly
allies
and
confederates
,
receive
no
defiances
at
the
hands
*NL*
of
slaves
,
bondsmen
,
or
fugitives
.
If
the
person
calling
himself
the
*NL*
Black
Knight
have
indeed
a
claim
to
the
honours
of
chivalry
,
he
ought
*NL*
to
know
that
he
stands
degraded
by
his
present
association
,
and
has
no
*NL*
right
to
ask
reckoning
at
the
hands
of
good
men
of
noble
blood
.
Touching
*NL*
the
prisoners
we
have
made
,
we
do
in
Christian
charity
require
you
to
*NL*
send
a
man
of
religion
,
to
receive
their
confession
,
and
reconcile
them
*NL*
with
God
;
since
it
is
our
fixed
intention
to
execute
them
this
morning
*NL*
before
noon
,
so
that
their
heads
being
placed
on
the
battlements
,
*NL*
shall
show
to
all
men
how
lightly
we
esteem
those
who
have
bestirred
*NL*
themselves
in
their
rescue
.
Wherefore
,
as
above
,
we
require
you
to
send
*NL*
a
priest
to
reconcile
them
to
God
,
in
doing
which
you
shall
render
them
*NL*
the
last
earthly
service
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
letter
being
folded
,
was
delivered
to
the
squire
,
and
by
him
to
*NL*
the
messenger
who
waited
without
,
as
the
answer
to
that
which
he
had
*NL*
brought
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
yeoman
having
thus
accomplished
his
mission
,
returned
to
the
*NL*
head-quarters
of
the
allies
,
which
were
for
the
present
established
*NL*
under
a
venerable
oak-tree
,
about
three
arrow-flights
distant
from
the
*NL*
castle
.
Here
Wamba
and
Gurth
,
with
their
allies
the
Black
Knight
and
*NL*
Locksley
,
and
the
jovial
hermit
,
awaited
with
impatience
an
answer
to
*NL*
their
summons
.
Around
,
and
at
a
distance
from
them
,
were
seen
many
a
*NL*
bold
yeoman
,
whose
silvan
dress
and
weatherbeaten
countenances
showed
*NL*
the
ordinary
nature
of
their
occupation
.
More
than
two
hundred
had
*NL*
already
assembled
,
and
others
were
fast
coming
in
.
Those
whom
they
*NL*
obeyed
as
leaders
were
only
distinguished
from
the
others
by
a
feather
*NL*
in
the
cap
,
their
dress
,
arms
,
and
equipments
being
in
all
other
*NL*
respects
the
same
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
these
bands
,
a
less
orderly
and
a
worse
armed
force
,
consisting
*NL*
of
the
Saxon
inhabitants
of
the
neighbouring
township
,
as
well
as
*NL*
many
bondsmen
and
servants
from
Cedric
's
extensive
estate
,
had
already
*NL*
arrived
,
for
the
purpose
of
assisting
in
his
rescue
.
Few
of
these
were
*NL*
armed
otherwise
than
with
such
rustic
weapons
as
necessity
sometimes
*NL*
converts
to
military
purposes
.
Boar-spears
,
scythes
,
flails
,
and
the
*NL*
like
,
were
their
chief
arms
;
for
the
Normans
,
with
the
usual
policy
*NL*
of
conquerors
,
were
jealous
of
permitting
to
the
vanquished
Saxons
the
*NL*
possession
or
the
use
of
swords
and
spears
.
These
circumstances
rendered
*NL*
the
assistance
of
the
Saxons
far
from
being
so
formidable
to
the
*NL*
besieged
,
as
the
strength
of
the
men
themselves
,
their
superior
numbers
,
*NL*
and
the
animation
inspired
by
a
just
cause
,
might
otherwise
well
have
*NL*
made
them
.
It
was
to
the
leaders
of
this
motley
army
that
the
letter
of
*NL*
the
Templar
was
now
delivered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Reference
was
at
first
made
to
the
chaplain
for
an
exposition
of
its
*NL*
contents
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
crook
of
St
Dunstan
,
''
said
that
worthy
ecclesiastic
,
``
which
hath
*NL*
brought
more
sheep
within
the
sheepfold
than
the
crook
of
e'er
another
*NL*
saint
in
Paradise
,
I
swear
that
I
can
not
expound
unto
you
this
jargon
,
*NL*
which
,
whether
it
be
French
or
Arabic
,
is
beyond
my
guess
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
then
gave
the
letter
to
Gurth
,
who
shook
his
head
gruffly
,
and
passed
*NL*
it
to
Wamba
.
The
Jester
looked
at
each
of
the
four
corners
of
the
paper
*NL*
with
such
a
grin
of
affected
intelligence
as
a
monkey
is
apt
to
assume
*NL*
upon
similar
occasions
,
then
cut
a
caper
,
and
gave
the
letter
to
*NL*
Locksley
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
the
long
letters
were
bows
,
and
the
short
letters
broad
arrows
,
I
*NL*
might
know
something
of
the
matter
,
''
said
the
brave
yeoman
;
``
but
as
the
*NL*
matter
stands
,
the
meaning
is
as
safe
,
for
me
,
as
the
stag
that
's
at
*NL*
twelve
miles
distance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
be
clerk
,
then
,
''
said
the
Black
Knight
;
and
taking
the
letter
*NL*
from
Locksley
,
he
first
read
it
over
to
himself
,
and
then
explained
the
*NL*
meaning
in
Saxon
to
his
confederates
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Execute
the
noble
Cedric
!
''
exclaimed
Wamba
;
``
by
the
rood
,
thou
must
be
*NL*
mistaken
,
Sir
Knight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
I
,
my
worthy
friend
,
''
replied
the
knight
,
``
I
have
explained
the
*NL*
words
as
they
are
here
set
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
by
St
Thomas
of
Canterbury
,
''
replied
Gurth
,
``
we
will
have
the
*NL*
castle
,
should
we
tear
it
down
with
our
hands
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
nothing
else
to
tear
it
with
,
''
replied
Wamba
;
``
but
mine
are
*NL*
scarce
fit
to
make
mammocks
of
freestone
and
mortar
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
but
a
contrivance
to
gain
time
,
''
said
Locksley
;
``
they
dare
not
do
*NL*
a
deed
for
which
I
could
exact
a
fearful
penalty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
,
''
said
the
Black
Knight
,
``
there
were
some
one
among
us
who
*NL*
could
obtain
admission
into
the
castle
,
and
discover
how
the
case
stands
*NL*
with
the
besieged
.
Methinks
,
as
they
require
a
confessor
to
be
sent
,
*NL*
this
holy
hermit
might
at
once
exercise
his
pious
vocation
,
and
procure
*NL*
us
the
information
we
desire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
plague
on
thee
,
and
thy
advice
!
''
said
the
pious
hermit
;
``
I
tell
thee
,
*NL*
Sir
Slothful
Knight
,
that
when
I
doff
my
friar
's
frock
,
my
priesthood
,
*NL*
my
sanctity
,
my
very
Latin
,
are
put
off
along
with
it
;
and
when
in
my
*NL*
green
jerkin
,
I
can
better
kill
twenty
deer
than
confess
one
Christian
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
fear
,
''
said
the
Black
Knight
,
``
I
fear
greatly

there
is
no
one
here

qualified

take
upon

this

character
*NL*
of

''
*NL*
*NL*
All
looked
on
each
other
,
and
were
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
,
''
said
Wamba
,
after
a
short
pause
,
``
that
the
fool
must
be
still

fool

put
his

from

I
wore
russet

wore
motley

upon

Hath

said
the
Black
Knight
,
addressing

Gurth

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

said
Gurth
;

On

quoth
the
Knight

muffled
in

he
imitated

solemn

Old
Song
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
Jester
,
arrayed
in
the
cowl
and
frock
of
the
hermit
,
and
having
*NL*
his
knotted
cord
twisted
round
his
middle
,
stood
before
the
portal
of
*NL*
the
castle
of
Front-de-Boeuf
,
the
warder
demanded
of
him
his
name
and
*NL*
errand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pax
vobiscum
,
''
answered
the
Jester
,
``
I
am
a
poor
brother
of
the
Order
*NL*
of
St
Francis
,
who
come
hither
to
do
my
office
to
certain
unhappy
*NL*
prisoners
now
secured
within
this
castle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
art
a
bold
friar
,
''
said
the
warder
,
``
to
come
hither
,
where
,
saving
*NL*
our
own
drunken
confessor
,
a
cock
of
thy
feather
hath
not
crowed
these
*NL*
twenty
years
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
I
pray
thee
,
do
mine
errand
to
the
lord
of
the
castle
,
''
answered
*NL*
the
pretended
friar
;
``
trust
me
it
will
find
good
acceptance
with
him
,
*NL*
and
the
cock
shall
crow
,
that
the
whole
castle
shall
hear
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gramercy
,
''
said
the
warder
;
``
but
if
I
come
to
shame
for
leaving
my
*NL*
post
upon
thine
errand
,
I
will
try
whether
a
friar
's
grey
gown
be
proof
*NL*
against
a
grey-goose
shaft
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
threat
he
left
his
turret
,
and
carried
to
the
hall
of
the
*NL*
castle
his
unwonted
intelligence
,
that
a
holy
friar
stood
before
the
*NL*
gate
and
demanded
instant
admission
.
With
no
small
wonder
he
received
*NL*
his
master
's
commands
to
admit
the
holy
man
immediately
;
and
,
having
*NL*
previously
manned
the
entrance
to
guard
against
surprise
,
he
obeyed
,
*NL*
without
further
scruple
,
the
commands
which
he
had
received
.
The
*NL*
harebrained
self-conceit
which
had
emboldened
Wamba
to
undertake
this
*NL*
dangerous
office
,
was
scarce
sufficient
to
support
him
when
he
found
*NL*
himself
in
the
presence
of
a
man
so
dreadful
,
and
so
much
dreaded
,
as
*NL*
Reginald
Front-de-Boeuf
,
and
he
brought
out
his
``
pax
vobiscum
''
,
to
which
*NL*
he
,
in
a
good
measure
,
trusted
for
supporting
his
character
,
with
*NL*
more
anxiety
and
hesitation
than
had
hitherto
accompanied
it
.
But
*NL*
Front-de-Boeuf
was
accustomed
to
see
men
of
all
ranks
tremble
in
his
*NL*
presence
,
so
that
the
timidity
of
the
supposed
father
did
not
give
him
*NL*
any
cause
of
suspicion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
and
whence
art
thou
,
priest
?
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Pax
vobiscum

,
''
reiterated
the
Jester
,
``
I
am
a
poor
servant
of
St

office
on
two
persons
condemned
by
your
honourable
justice

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay

''
answered
Front-de-Boeuf
;
``
and
canst
thou
tell

number

those
banditti

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas

said
the
supposed
friar
,

,
that
is
to
*NL*
say
,
I
was
like
to
burst
with
fear
!
but
I
conceive
they
may
be
--
what
of
*NL*
yeomen
--
what
of
commons
,
at
least
five
hundred
men
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
said
the
Templar
,
who
came
into
the
hall
that
moment
,
``
muster
*NL*
the
wasps
so
thick
here
?
it
is
time
to
stifle
such
a
mischievous
brood
.
''
*NL*
Then
taking
Front-de-Boeuf
aside
``
Knowest
thou
the
priest
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
a
stranger
from
a
distant
convent

said
Front-de-Boeuf
;
``
I
know
*NL*
him
not

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
trust
him
not
with
thy
purpose
in
words
,
''
answered
the
Templar
.
*NL*
``
Let
him
carry
a
written
order
to
De
Bracy
's
company
of
Free
Companions
,
*NL*
to
repair
instantly
to
their
master
's
aid
.
In
the
meantime
,
and
that
the
*NL*
shaveling
may
suspect
nothing
,
permit
him
to
go
freely
about
his
task
of
*NL*
preparing
these
Saxon
hogs
for
the
slaughter-house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
shall
be
so
,
''
said
Front-de-Boeuf
.
And
he
forthwith
appointed
a
*NL*
domestic
to
conduct
Wamba
to
the
apartment
where
Cedric
and
Athelstane
*NL*
were
confined
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
impatience
of
Cedric
had
been
rather
enhanced
than
diminished
by
his
*NL*
confinement
.
He
walked
from
one
end
of
the
hall
to
the
other
,
with
the
*NL*
attitude
of
one
who
advances
to
charge
an
enemy
,
or
to
storm
the
breach
*NL*
of
a
beleaguered
place
,
sometimes
ejaculating
to
himself
,
sometimes
*NL*
addressing
Athelstane
,
who
stoutly
and
stoically
awaited
the
issue
of
*NL*
the
adventure
,
digesting
,
in
the
meantime
,
with
great
composure
,
the
*NL*
liberal
meal
which
he
had
made
at
noon
,
and
not
greatly
interesting
*NL*
himself
about
the
duration
of
his
captivity

he
concluded
,
would
,
*NL*
like
all
earthly
evils

find
an
end
in
Heaven
's
good
time

*NL*
*NL*

said
the
Jester
,
entering
the
apartment
;
``

Cedric

said
the

they
will
make
by
exchanging
a
fool
for
a
wise
man
.
Truly
,
I
*NL*
fear
they
will
lose
in
valour
what
they
may
gain
in
discretion
.
And
so
*NL*
farewell
,
master
,
and
be
kind
to
poor
Gurth
and
his
dog
Fangs
;
and
let
*NL*
my
cockscomb
hang
in
the
hall
at
Rotherwood
,
in
memory
that
I
flung
away
*NL*
my
life
for
my
master
,
like
a
faithful
--
fool
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
last
word
came
out
with
a
sort
of
double
expression
,
betwixt
jest
*NL*
and
earnest
.
The
tears
stood
in
Cedric
's
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thy
memory
shall
be
preserved
,
''
he
said
,
``
while
fidelity
and
affection
*NL*
have
honour
upon
earth
!
But
that
I
trust
I
shall
find
the
means
of
*NL*
saving
Rowena
,
and
thee
,
Athelstane
,
and
thee
,
also
,
my
poor
Wamba
,
thou
*NL*
shouldst
not
overbear
me
in
this
matter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
exchange
of
dress
was
now
accomplished
,
when
a
sudden
doubt
struck
*NL*
Cedric
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
no
language
,
''
he
said
,
``
but
my
own
,
and
a
few
words
of
their
*NL*
mincing
Norman
.
How
shall
I
bear
myself
like
a
reverend
brother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
spell
lies
in
two
words
,
''
replied
Wamba
--
''
`
Pax
vobiscum
'
will
*NL*
answer
all
queries
.
If
you
go
or
come
,
eat
or
drink
,
bless
or
ban
,
`
Pax
*NL*
vobiscum
'
carries
you
through
it
all
.
It
is
as
useful
to
a
friar
as
a
*NL*
broomstick
to
a
witch
,
or
a
wand
to
a
conjurer
.
Speak
it
but
thus
,
in
a
*NL*
deep
grave
tone
,
--
`
Pax
vobiscum
!
'
--
it
is
irresistible
--
Watch
and
ward
,
*NL*
knight
and
squire
,
foot
and
horse
,
it
acts
as
a
charm
upon
them
all
.
*NL*
I
think
,
if
they
bring
me
out
to
be
hanged
to-morrow
,
as
is
much
to
*NL*
be
doubted
they
may
,
I
will
try
its
weight
upon
the
finisher
of
the
*NL*
sentence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
such
prove
the
case
,
''
said
the
master
,
``
my
religious
orders
are
soon
*NL*
taken
--
`
Pax
vobiscum
'
.
I
trust
I
shall
remember
the
pass-word
.
--
Noble
*NL*
Athelstane
,
farewell
;
and
farewell
,
my
poor
boy
,
whose
heart
might
make
*NL*
amends
for
a
weaker
head
--
I
will
save
you
,
or
return
and
die
with
you
.
*NL*
The
royal
blood
of
our
Saxon
kings
shall
not
be
spilt
while
mine
beats
*NL*
in
my
veins
;
nor
shall
one
hair
fall
from
the
head
of
the
kind
knave
*NL*
who
risked
himself
for
his
master
,
if
Cedric
's
peril
can
prevent
*NL*
it
.
--
Farewell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Farewell
,
noble
Cedric
,
''
said
Athelstane
;
``
remember
it
is
the
true
part
*NL*
of
a
friar
to
accept
refreshment
,
if
you
are
offered
any
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Farewell
,
uncle
,
''
added
Wamba
;
``
and
remember
`
Pax
vobiscum
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
exhorted
,
Cedric
sallied
forth
upon
his
expedition
;
and
it
was
not
*NL*
long
ere
he
had
occasion
to
try
the
force
of
that
spell
which
his
Jester
*NL*
had
recommended
as
omnipotent
.
In
a
low-arched
and
dusky
passage
,
by
*NL*
which
he
endeavoured
to
work
his
way
to
the
hall
of
the
castle
,
he
was
*NL*
interrupted
by
a
female
form
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Pax
vobiscum
!
'
''
said
the
pseudo
friar
,
and
was
endeavouring
to
*NL*
hurry
past
,
when
a
soft
voice
replied
,
''
`
Et
vobis
--
quaso
,
domine
*NL*
reverendissime
,
pro
misericordia
vestra
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
somewhat
deaf
,
''
replied
Cedric
,
in
good
Saxon
,
and
at
the
same
*NL*
time
muttered
to
himself
,
``
A
curse
on
the
fool
and
his
`
Pax
vobiscum
!
'
I
*NL*
have
lost
my
javelin
at
the
first
cast
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
,
however
,
no
unusual
thing
for
a
priest
of
those
days
to
be
deaf
*NL*
of
his
Latin
ear
,
and
this
the
person
who
now
addressed
Cedric
knew
full
*NL*
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
pray
you
of
dear
love
,
reverend
father
,
''
she
replied
in
his
own
*NL*
language
,
``
that
you
will
deign
to
visit
with
your
ghostly
comfort
a
*NL*
wounded
prisoner
of
this
castle
,
and
have
such
compassion
upon
him
and
*NL*
us
as
thy
holy
office
teaches
--
Never
shall
good
deed
so
highly
advantage
*NL*
thy
convent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Daughter
,
''
answered
Cedric
,
much
embarrassed
,
``
my
time
in
this
castle
*NL*
will
not
permit
me
to
exercise
the
duties
of
mine
office
--
I
must
*NL*
presently
forth
--
there
is
life
and
death
upon
my
speed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
,
father
,
let
me
entreat
you
by
the
vow
you
have
taken
on
you
,
''
*NL*
replied
the
suppliant
,
``
not
to
leave
the
oppressed
and
endangered
*NL*
without
counsel
or
succour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
the
fiend
fly
away
with
me
,
and
leave
me
in
Ifrin
with
the
souls
of
*NL*
Odin
and
of
Thor
!
''
answered
Cedric
impatiently
,
and
would
probably
*NL*
have
proceeded
in
the
same
tone
of
total
departure
from
his
spiritual
*NL*
character
,
when
the
colloquy
was
interrupted
by
the
harsh
voice
of
*NL*
Urfried
,
the
old
crone
of
the
turret
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
,
minion
,
''
said
she
to
the
female
speaker
,
``
is
this
the
manner
*NL*
in
which
you
requite
the
kindness
which
permitted
thee
to
leave
thy
*NL*
prison-cell
yonder
?
--
Puttest
thou
the
reverend
man
to
use
ungracious
*NL*
language
to
free
himself
from
the
importunities
of
a
Jewess
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
Jewess
!
''
said
Cedric
,
availing
himself
of
the
information
to
get
*NL*
clear
of
their
interruption
,
--
``
Let
me
pass
,
woman
!
stop
me
not
at
your
*NL*
peril
.
I
am
fresh
from
my
holy
office
,
and
would
avoid
pollution
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
this
way
,
father
,
''
said
the
old
hag
,
``
thou
art
a
stranger
in
this
*NL*
castle
,
and
canst
not
leave
it
without
a
guide

Come
hither

for
I
would
*NL*
speak
with
thee
.

And
you
,
daughter
of
an
accursed
race
,
go
to
the
sick
*NL*
man
's
chamber
,
and
tend
him
until
my
return
;
and
woe
betide
you
if
you
*NL*
again
quit
it
without
my
permission
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rebecca
retreated
.
Her
importunities
had
prevailed
upon
Urfried
to
*NL*
suffer
her
to
quit
the
turret
,
and
Urfried
had
employed
her
services
*NL*
where
she
herself
would
most
gladly
have
paid
them
,
by
the
bedside
of
*NL*
the
wounded
Ivanhoe
.
With
an
understanding
awake
to
their
dangerous
*NL*
situation
,
and
prompt
to
avail
herself
of
each
means
of
safety
which
*NL*
occurred
,
Rebecca
had
hoped
something
from
the
presence
of
a
man
of
*NL*
religion
,
who
,
she
learned
from
Urfried
,
had
penetrated
into
this
*NL*
godless
castle
.
She
watched
the
return
of
the
supposed
ecclesiastic
,
*NL*
with
the
purpose
of
addressing
him
,
and
interesting
him
in
favour
of
*NL*
the
prisoners
;
with
what
imperfect
success
the
reader
has
been
just
*NL*
acquainted

CHAPTER
XXVII
*NL*
*NL*
Fond
wretch

and
what
canst
thou
relate
,
*NL*
But
deeds
of
sorrow
,
shame
,
and
sin
?
*NL*
Thy
deeds
are
proved

thy

But
come

thy

*

*NL*
But
I
have
griefs
of
other
kind
,
*NL*
Troubles
and
sorrows
more
severe
;
*NL*
Give
me
to
ease
my
tortured
mind
,
*NL*
Lend
to
my
woes
a
patient
ear
;
*NL*
And
let
me
,
if
I
may
not
find

A
friend
to
help

find
one
to
hear

Crabbe
's
Hall
of
Justice
*NL*
*NL*
When
Urfried
had
with
clamours
and
menaces
driven
Rebecca
back
to
the
*NL*
apartment
from
which
she
had
sallied
,
she
proceeded
to
conduct
the
*NL*
unwilling
Cedric
into
a
small
apartment
,
the
door
of
which
she
heedfully
*NL*
secured
.
Then
fetching
from
a
cupboard
a
stoup
of
wine
and
two
flagons
,
*NL*
she
placed
them
on
the
table
,
and
said
in
a
tone
rather
asserting
a
*NL*
fact
than
asking
a
question
,
``
Thou
art
Saxon
,
father
--
Deny
it
not
,
''
she
*NL*
continued
,
observing
that
Cedric
hastened
not
to
reply
;
``
the
sounds
of
*NL*
my
native
language
are
sweet
to
mine
ears
,
though
seldom
heard
save
from
*NL*
the
tongues
of
the
wretched
and
degraded
serfs
on
whom
the
proud
*NL*
Normans
impose
the
meanest
drudgery
of
this
dwelling
.
Thou
art
a
*NL*
Saxon
,
father
--
a
Saxon
,
and
,
save
as
thou
art
a
servant
of
God
,
a
*NL*
freeman
.
--
Thine
accents
are
sweet
in
mine
ear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
Saxon
priests
visit
this
castle
,
then
?
''
replied
Cedric
;
``
it
*NL*
were
,
methinks
,
their
duty
to
comfort
the
outcast
and
oppressed
children
*NL*
of
the
soil
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
come
not
--
or
if
they
come
,
they
better
love
to
revel
at
the
boards
*NL*
of
their
conquerors
,
''
answered
Urfried
,
``
than
to
hear
the
groans
of
*NL*
their
countrymen
--
so
,
at
least
,
report
speaks
of
them
--
of
myself
I
can
*NL*
say
little
.
This
castle
,
for
ten
years
,
has
opened
to
no
priest
save
*NL*
the
debauched
Norman
chaplain
who
partook
the
nightly
revels
of
*NL*
Front-de-Boeuf
,
and
he
has
been
long
gone
to
render
an
account
of
his
*NL*
stewardship
.
--
But
thou
art
a
Saxon
--
a
Saxon
priest
,
and
I
have
one
*NL*
question
to
ask
of
thee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
a
Saxon
,
''
answered
Cedric
,
``
but
unworthy
,
surely
,
of
the
name
of
*NL*
priest
.
Let
me
begone
on
my
way
--
I
swear
I
will
return
,
or
send
one
of
*NL*
our
fathers
more
worthy
to
hear
your
confession
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
yet
a
while
,
''
said
Urfried
;
``
the
accents
of
the
voice
which
thou
*NL*
hearest
now
will
soon
be
choked
with
the
cold
earth
,
and
I
would
*NL*
not
descend
to
it
like
the
beast
I
have
lived
.
But
wine
must
give
me
*NL*
strength
to
tell
the
horrors
of
my
tale
.
''
She
poured
out
a
cup
,
and
*NL*
drank
it
with
a
frightful
avidity
,
which
seemed
desirous
of
draining
the
*NL*
last
drop
in
the
goblet
.
``
It
stupifies
,
''
she
said
,
looking
upwards
as
*NL*
she
finished
her
drought
,
``
but
it
can
not
cheer
--
Partake
it
,
father
,
if
*NL*
you
would
hear
my
tale
without
sinking
down
upon
the
pavement
.
''
Cedric
*NL*
would
have
avoided
pledging
her
in
this
ominous
conviviality
,
but
the
*NL*
sign
which
she
made
to
him
expressed
impatience
and
despair
.
He
complied
*NL*
with
her
request
,
and
answered
her
challenge
in
a
large
wine-cup
;
she
*NL*
then
proceeded
with
her
story
,
as
if
appeased
by
his
complaisance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
not
born
,
''
she
said
,
``
father
,
the
wretch
that
thou
now
seest
me

*NL*
I
was
free
,
was
happy

was
honoured
,
loved
,
and
was
beloved

I
am
now
a
*NL*
slave
,
miserable
and
degraded
--
the
sport
of
my
masters

passions
while
*NL*
I
had
yet
beauty
--
the
object
of
their
contempt
,
scorn
,
and
hatred
,
*NL*
since
it
has
passed
away
.
Dost
thou
wonder
,
father

that
I
should
hate
*NL*
mankind
,
and
,
above
all
,
the
race
that
has
wrought
this
change
in
me
?
*NL*
Can
the
wrinkled
decrepit
hag
before
thee

whose
wrath
must
vent
itself
*NL*
in
impotent
curses
,
forget
she
was
once
the
daughter
of
the
noble
Thane
*NL*
of
Torquilstone
,
before
whose
frown
a
thousand
vassals
trembled
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
the
daughter
of
Torquil
Wolfganger

said
Cedric
,
receding
as
he
*NL*
spoke
;
``
thou

thou

the
daughter
of
that
noble
Saxon

*NL*
*NL*
``
Thy

Urfried
;

Cedric

Rotherwood

why
this
religious
dress
?

hast
thou
too
despaired
of
saving

thy
country

sought
refuge
from
oppression
in
the
shade
of
the
*NL*
convent
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
matters
not
who
I
am

said
Cedric
;
``
proceed

unhappy
woman

with
*NL*
thy
tale
of
horror

guilt

Guilt
there
must
be

guilt

*NL*
in
thy
living
to
tell
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is

answered
the
wretched
woman
,
``
deep

black

damning

lies

guilt

all

penitential
fires

hereafter
can
not
cleanse

Yes

stained
with
the
noble

pure
blood
of
my
father

my
brethren

in

these
very
halls

to
have
lived
the
paramour
of
their
murderer

the
*NL*
slave

the
partaker
of
his
pleasures

was
to
render
every
*NL*
breath

I
drew
of
vital
air

a
crime

a
curse

*NL*
*NL*
``
Wretched

exclaimed
Cedric
.
``
And

not

*NL*
``
In

answered
the

hag
;

No

at

I
can
not
reproach

myself

hatred
to
Front-de-Boeuf

his

my
soul
most
*NL*
deeply
,
even
in
the
hour
of
his
guilty
endearments

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
hated
him

replied
Cedric
;
``

there

Well
was
it

prize
such
an
existence

Norman
castle

For

in
foul
communion
with
the
murderer

*NL*
*NL*
``
Wouldst

done
this

Ulrica

may
now
lay
aside
her
assumed
name

guilt
shrouds
itself

has
the

sounded

an

this
foul
and

face
some

*NL*

Ask

Ulrica

Cedric
,
in
a
tone
of
grief
mixed
*NL*
with
abhorrence
;

these

form
such
a

the
lifeless
corpse

*NL*
*NL*

Ulrica

these
fiendish

variance
the
elder

Front-de-Boeuf

Reginald

The
darkness

revenge
must
lift
the
veil

darkly
intimate
what

blazed
forth

the
maddening

love

pleasure

mingled
with
the
keen
appetite

revenge

the
proud
*NL*
consciousness
of
power

droughts
too
intoxicating
for
the
human
heart

bear

away

awakened

thou

assured

hitherto
shared
this
wasted

henceforward
it

*NL*
*NL*
Cedric
would
have
enquired
farther
into
the
purpose

she
thus
*NL*
darkly
announced
,

the
stern
voice
of
Front-de-Boeuf
was
heard
,
*NL*
exclaiming
,
``
Where

she
thus
spoke

she
vanished
through
a
private
door

Reginald

entered
the
apartment

some
difficulty

make
obeisance

inclination

the
head

fear

Front-de-Boeuf

Front-de-Boeuf
took

drought

addressed

Wamba
drew
the

honoured

cut
out
of

*NL*
*NL*
``
Blaspheme
not

holy

Reginald

said
De
Bracy
,
``

shall
*NL*
have
need

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
expect
little
aid
from
their
hand

said
Front-de-Boeuf
,
``
unless
we
*NL*
were
to
hurl
them

a

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Templar
had
in
the
meantime
been
looking
out
on
the
proceedings
of
*NL*
the
besiegers
,
with
rather
more
attention
than
the
brutal
Front-de-Boeuf
*NL*
or
his
giddy
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
faith
of
mine
order

''
he
said
,
``
these
men
approach
with
more
*NL*
touch
of
discipline
than
could
have
been
judged

however
they
come

it

See
ye
how
dexterously
they
avail
themselves
of
every
cover

*NL*
a

affords

*NL*
*NL*
``

De

;
``

Front-de-Boeuf

The
demonstrations
of
the
enemy

cut
off
all

Each

repaired

at

of

*NL*
This

*NL*
Boast

*NL*
--
The
Jew
*NL*
*NL*
Our
history
must
needs
retrograde
for
the
space
of
a
few
pages
,
to
*NL*
inform
the
reader
of
certain
passages
material
to
his
understanding
the
*NL*
rest
of
this
important
narrative
.
His
own
intelligence
may
indeed
have
*NL*
easily
anticipated
that
,
when
Ivanhoe
sunk
down
,
and
seemed
abandoned
by
*NL*
all
the
world
,
it
was
the
importunity
of
Rebecca
which
prevailed
on
her
*NL*
father
to
have
the
gallant
young
warrior
transported
from
the
lists
to
*NL*
the
house
which
for
the
time
the
Jews
inhabited
in
the
suburbs
of
Ashby
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
not
have
been
difficult
to
have
persuaded
Isaac
to
this
step
in
*NL*
any
other
circumstances
,
for
his
disposition
was
kind
and
grateful
.
But
*NL*
he
had
also
the
prejudices
and
scrupulous
timidity
of
his
persecuted
*NL*
people
,
and
those
were
to
be
conquered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Holy
Abraham
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
``
he
is
a
good
youth
,
and
my
heart
bleeds
*NL*
to
see
the
gore
trickle
down
his
rich
embroidered
hacqueton
,
and
his
*NL*
corslet
of
goodly
price
--
but
to
carry
him
to
our
house
!
--
damsel
,
hast
*NL*
thou
well
considered
?
--
he
is
a
Christian
,
and
by
our
law
we
may
not
deal
*NL*
with
the
stranger
and
Gentile
,
save
for
the
advantage
of
our
commerce
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak
not
so
,
my
dear
father
,
''
replied
Rebecca
;
``
we
may
not
indeed
mix
*NL*
with
them
in
banquet
and
in
jollity
;
but
in
wounds
and
in
misery
,
the
*NL*
Gentile
becometh
the
Jew
's
brother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
I
knew
what
the
Rabbi
Jacob
Ben
Tudela
would
opine
on
it
,
''
*NL*
replied
Isaac
;
--
``
nevertheless
,
the
good
youth
must
not
bleed
to
death
.
*NL*
Let
Seth
and
Reuben
bear
him
to
Ashby
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
let
them
place
him
in
my
litter
,
''
said
Rebecca
;
``
I
will
mount
one
*NL*
of
the
palfreys
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
were
to
expose
thee
to
the
gaze
of
those
dogs
of
Ishmael
and
of
*NL*
Edom
,
''
whispered
Isaac
,
with
a
suspicious
glance
towards
the
crowd
of
*NL*
knights
and
squires
.
But
Rebecca
was
already
busied
in
carrying
her
*NL*
charitable
purpose
into
effect
,
and
listed
not
what
he
said
,
until
*NL*
Isaac
,
seizing
the
sleeve
of
her
mantle
,
again
exclaimed
,
in
a
hurried
*NL*
voice
--
``
Beard
of
Aaron
!
--
what
if
the
youth
perish
!
--
if
he
die
in
our
*NL*
custody
,
shall
we
not
be
held
guilty
of
his
blood
,
and
be
torn
to
pieces
*NL*
by
the
multitude
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
will
not
die
,
my
father
,
''
said
Rebecca
,
gently
extricating
herself
*NL*
from
the
grasp
of
Isaac
``
he
will
not
die
unless
we
abandon
him
;
and
if
*NL*
so
,
we
are
indeed
answerable
for
his
blood
to
God
and
to
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
''
said
Isaac
,
releasing
his
hold
,
``
it
grieveth
me
as
much
to
see
*NL*
the
drops
of
his
blood
,
as
if
they
were
so
many
golden
byzants
from
mine
*NL*
own
purse
;
and
I
well
know
,
that
the
lessons
of
Miriam
,
daughter
of
the
*NL*
Rabbi
Manasses
of
Byzantium
whose
soul
is
in
Paradise
,
have
made
thee
*NL*
skilful
in
the
art
of
healing
,
and
that
thou
knowest
the
craft
of
herbs
,
*NL*
and
the
force
of
elixirs
.
Therefore
,
do
as
thy
mind
giveth
thee
--
thou
*NL*
art
a
good
damsel
,
a
blessing
,
and
a
crown
,
and
a
song
of
rejoicing
unto
*NL*
me
and
unto
my
house
,
and
unto
the
people
of
my
fathers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
apprehensions
of
Isaac
,
however
,
were
not
ill
founded
;
and
the
*NL*
generous
and
grateful
benevolence
of
his
daughter
exposed
her
,
on
her
*NL*
return
to
Ashby
,
to
the
unhallowed
gaze
of
Brian
de
Bois-Guilbert
.
The
*NL*
Templar
twice
passed
and
repassed
them
on
the
road
,
fixing
his
bold
*NL*
and
ardent
look
on
the
beautiful
Jewess
;
and
we
have
already
seen
the
*NL*
consequences
of
the
admiration
which
her
charms
excited
when
accident
*NL*
threw
her
into
the
power
of
that
unprincipled
voluptuary
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rebecca
lost
no
time
in
causing
the
patient
to
be
transported
to
their
*NL*
temporary
dwelling
,
and
proceeded
with
her
own
hands
to
examine
and
*NL*
to
bind
up
his
wounds
.
The
youngest
reader
of
romances
and
romantic
*NL*
ballads
,
must
recollect
how
often
the
females
,
during
the
dark
ages
,
as
*NL*
they
are
called
,
were
initiated
into
the
mysteries
of
surgery
,
and
how
*NL*
frequently
the
gallant
knight
submitted
the
wounds
of
his
person
to
her
*NL*
cure
,
whose
eyes
had
yet
more
deeply
penetrated
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
Jews
,
both
male
and
female
,
possessed
and
practised
the
medical
*NL*
science
in
all
its
branches
,
and
the
monarchs
and
powerful
barons
of
the
*NL*
time
frequently
committed
themselves
to
the
charge
of
some
experienced
*NL*
sage
among
this
despised
people
,
when
wounded
or
in
sickness
.
The
aid
*NL*
of
the
Jewish
physicians
was
not
the
less
eagerly
sought
after
,
though
*NL*
a
general
belief
prevailed
among
the
Christians
,
that
the
Jewish
Rabbins
*NL*
were
deeply
acquainted
with
the
occult
sciences
,
and
particularly
with
*NL*
the
cabalistical
art
,
which
had
its
name
and
origin
in
the
studies
of
*NL*
the
sages
of
Israel
.
Neither
did
the
Rabbins
disown
such
acquaintance
*NL*
with
supernatural
arts
,
which
added
nothing
-LRB-
for
what
could
add
aught
?
-RRB-
*NL*
to
the
hatred
with
which
their
nation
was
regarded
,
while
it
diminished
*NL*
the
contempt
with
which
that
malevolence
was
mingled
.
A
Jewish
magician
*NL*
might
be
the
subject
of
equal
abhorrence
with
a
Jewish
usurer
,
but
he
*NL*
could
not
be
equally
despised
.
It
is
besides
probable
,
considering
the
*NL*
wonderful
cures
they
are
said
to
have
performed
,
that
the
Jews
possessed
*NL*
some
secrets
of
the
healing
art
peculiar
to
themselves
,
and
which
,
with
*NL*
the
exclusive
spirit
arising
out
of
their
condition
,
they
took
great
*NL*
care
to
conceal
from
the
Christians
amongst
whom
they
dwelt
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
beautiful
Rebecca
had
been
heedfully
brought
up
in
all
the
knowledge
*NL*
proper
to
her
nation
,
which
her
apt
and
powerful
mind
had
retained
,
*NL*
arranged
,
and
enlarged
,
in
the
course
of
a
progress
beyond
her
years
,
*NL*
her
sex
,
and
even
the
age
in
which
she
lived
.
Her
knowledge
of
medicine
*NL*
and
of
the
healing
art
had
been
acquired
under
an
aged
Jewess
,
the
*NL*
daughter
of
one
of
their
most
celebrated
doctors
,
who
loved
Rebecca
as
*NL*
her
own
child
,
and
was
believed
to
have
communicated
to
her
secrets
,
*NL*
which
had
been
left
to
herself
by
her
sage
father
at
the
same
time
,
and
*NL*
under
the
same
circumstances
.
The
fate
of
Miriam
had
indeed
been
to
fall
*NL*
a
sacrifice
to
the
fanaticism
of
the
times
;
but
her
secrets
had
survived
*NL*
in
her
apt
pupil
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rebecca
,
thus
endowed
with
knowledge
as
with
beauty
,
was
universally
*NL*
revered
and
admired
by
her
own
tribe
,
who
almost
regarded
her
as
one
of
*NL*
those
gifted
women
mentioned
in
the
sacred
history
.
Her
father
himself
,
*NL*
out
of
reverence
for
her
talents
,
which
involuntarily
mingled
itself
*NL*
with
his
unbounded
affection
,
permitted
the
maiden
a
greater
liberty
*NL*
than
was
usually
indulged
to
those
of
her
sex
by
the
habits
of
her
*NL*
people
,
and
was
,
as
we
have
just
seen
,
frequently
guided
by
her
opinion
,
*NL*
even
in
preference
to
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Ivanhoe
reached
the
habitation
of
Isaac
,
he
was
still
in
a
state
*NL*
of
unconsciousness
,
owing
to
the
profuse
loss
of
blood
which
had
taken
*NL*
place
during
his
exertions
in
the
lists
.
Rebecca
examined
the
wound
,
*NL*
and
having
applied
to
it
such
vulnerary
remedies
as
her
art
prescribed
,
*NL*
informed
her
father
that
if
fever
could
be
averted
,
of
which
the
great
*NL*
bleeding
rendered
her
little
apprehensive
,
and
if
the
healing
balsam
of
*NL*
Miriam
retained
its
virtue
,
there
was
nothing
to
fear
for
his
guest
's
*NL*
life
,
and
that
he
might
with
safety
travel
to
York
with
them
on
the
*NL*
ensuing
day
.
Isaac
looked
a
little
blank
at
this
annunciation
.
His
*NL*
charity
would
willingly
have
stopped
short
at
Ashby
,
or
at
most
would
*NL*
have
left
the
wounded
Christian
to
be
tended
in
the
house
where
he
*NL*
was
residing
at
present
,
with
an
assurance
to
the
Hebrew
to
whom
it
*NL*
belonged
,
that
all
expenses
should
be
duly
discharged
.
To
this
,
however
,
*NL*
Rebecca
opposed
many
reasons
,
of
which
we
shall
only
mention
two
that
*NL*
had
peculiar
weight
with
Isaac
.
The
one
was
,
that
she
would
on
no
*NL*
account
put
the
phial
of
precious
balsam
into
the
hands
of
another
*NL*
physician
even
of
her
own
tribe
,
lest
that
valuable
mystery
should
be
*NL*
discovered
;
the
other
,
that
this
wounded
knight
,
Wilfred
of
Ivanhoe
,
was
*NL*
an
intimate
favourite
of
Richard
Coeur-de-Lion
,
and
that
,
in
case
the
*NL*
monarch
should
return
,
Isaac
,
who
had
supplied
his
brother
John
with
*NL*
treasure
to
prosecute
his
rebellious
purposes
,
would
stand
in
no
small
*NL*
need
of
a
powerful
protector
who
enjoyed
Richard
's
favour
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
art
speaking
but
sooth
,
Rebecca
,
''
said
Isaac
,
giving
way
to
these
*NL*
weighty
arguments
--
``
it
were
an
offending
of
Heaven
to
betray
the
secrets
*NL*
of
the
blessed
Miriam
;
for
the
good
which
Heaven
giveth
,
is
not
rashly
*NL*
to
be
squandered
upon
others
,
whether
it
be
talents
of
gold
and
*NL*
shekels
of
silver
,
or
whether
it
be
the
secret
mysteries
of
a
wise
*NL*
physician
--
assuredly
they
should
be
preserved
to
those
to
whom
*NL*
Providence
hath
vouchsafed
them
.
And
him
whom
the
Nazarenes
of
England
*NL*
call
the
Lion
's
Heart
,
assuredly
it
were
better
for
me
to
fall
into
the
*NL*
hands
of
a
strong
lion
of
Idumea
than
into
his
,
if
he
shall
have
got
*NL*
assurance
of
my
dealing
with
his
brother
.
Wherefore
I
will
lend
ear
to
*NL*
thy
counsel
,
and
this
youth
shall
journey
with
us
unto
York
,
and
our
*NL*
house
shall
be
as
a
home
to
him
until
his
wounds
shall
be
healed
.
And
if
*NL*
he
of
the
Lion
Heart
shall
return
to
the
land
,
as
is
now
noised
abroad
,
*NL*
then
shall
this
Wilfred
of
Ivanhoe
be
unto
me
as
a
wall
of
defence
,
when
*NL*
the
king
's
displeasure
shall
burn
high
against
thy
father
.
And
if
he
*NL*
doth
not
return
,
this
Wilfred
may
natheless
repay
us
our
charges
when
he
*NL*
shall
gain
treasure
by
the
strength
of
his
spear
and
of
his
sword
,
even
*NL*
as
he
did
yesterday
and
this
day
also
.
For
the
youth
is
a
good
youth
,
*NL*
and
keepeth
the
day
which
he
appointeth
,
and
restoreth
that
which
he
*NL*
borroweth
,
and
succoureth
the
Israelite
,
even
the
child
of
my
father
's
*NL*
house
,
when
he
is
encompassed
by
strong
thieves
and
sons
of
Belial
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
until
evening
was
nearly
closed
that
Ivanhoe
was
restored
to
*NL*
consciousness
of
his
situation
.
He
awoke
from
a
broken
slumber
,
under
*NL*
the
confused
impressions
which
are
naturally
attendant
on
the
recovery
*NL*
from
a
state
of
insensibility
.
He
was
unable
for
some
time
to
recall
*NL*
exactly
to
memory
the
circumstances
which
had
preceded
his
fall
in
the
*NL*
lists
,
or
to
make
out
any
connected
chain
of
the
events
in
which
he
had
*NL*
been
engaged
upon
the
yesterday
.
A
sense
of
wounds
and
injury
,
joined
*NL*
to
great
weakness
and
exhaustion
,
was
mingled
with
the
recollection
*NL*
of
blows
dealt
and
received
,
of
steeds
rushing
upon
each
other
,
*NL*
overthrowing
and
overthrown
--
of
shouts
and
clashing
of
arms
,
and
all
the
*NL*
heady
tumult
of
a
confused
fight
.
An
effort
to
draw
aside
the
curtain
of
*NL*
his
couch
was
in
some
degree
successful
,
although
rendered
difficult
by
*NL*
the
pain
of
his
wound
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
his
great
surprise
he
found
himself
in
a
room
magnificently
*NL*
furnished
,
but
having
cushions
instead
of
chairs
to
rest
upon
,
and
in
*NL*
other
respects
partaking
so
much
of
Oriental
costume
,
that
he
began
to
*NL*
doubt
whether
he
had
not
,
during
his
sleep
,
been
transported
back
*NL*
again
to
the
land
of
Palestine
.
The
impression
was
increased
,
when
,
*NL*
the
tapestry
being
drawn
aside
,
a
female
form
,
dressed
in
a
rich
habit
,
*NL*
which
partook
more
of
the
Eastern
taste
than
that
of
Europe
,
glided
*NL*
through
the
door
which
it
concealed
,
and
was
followed
by
a
swarthy
*NL*
domestic
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
wounded
knight
was
about
to
address
this
fair
apparition
,
she
*NL*
imposed
silence
by
placing
her
slender
finger
upon
her
ruby
lips
,
while
*NL*
the
attendant
,
approaching
him
,
proceeded
to
uncover
Ivanhoe
's
side
,
and
*NL*
the
lovely
Jewess
satisfied
herself
that
the
bandage
was
in
its
place
,
*NL*
and
the
wound
doing
well
.
She
performed
her
task
with
a
graceful
and
*NL*
dignified
simplicity
and
modesty
,
which
might
,
even
in
more
civilized
*NL*
days
,
have
served
to
redeem
it
from
whatever
might
seem
repugnant
to
*NL*
female
delicacy
.
The
idea
of
so
young
and
beautiful
a
person
engaged
in
*NL*
attendance
on
a
sick-bed
,
or
in
dressing
the
wound
of
one
of
a
different
*NL*
sex
,
was
melted
away
and
lost
in
that
of
a
beneficent
being
contributing
*NL*
her
effectual
aid
to
relieve
pain
,
and
to
avert
the
stroke
of
death
.
*NL*
Rebecca
's
few
and
brief
directions
were
given
in
the
Hebrew
language
*NL*
to
the
old
domestic
;
and
he
,
who
had
been
frequently
her
assistant
in
*NL*
similar
cases
,
obeyed
them
without
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
accents
of
an
unknown
tongue
,
however
harsh
they
might
have
sounded
*NL*
when
uttered
by
another
,
had
,
coming
from
the
beautiful
Rebecca
,
*NL*
the
romantic
and
pleasing
effect
which
fancy
ascribes
to
the
charms
*NL*
pronounced
by
some
beneficent
fairy
,
unintelligible
,
indeed
,
to
the
ear
,
*NL*
but
,
from
the
sweetness
of
utterance
,
and
benignity
of
aspect
,
which
*NL*
accompanied
them
,
touching
and
affecting
to
the
heart
.
Without
making
*NL*
an
attempt
at
further
question
,
Ivanhoe
suffered
them
in
silence
to
take
*NL*
the
measures
they
thought
most
proper
for
his
recovery
;
and
it
was
not
*NL*
until
those
were
completed
,
and
this
kind
physician
about
to
retire
,
*NL*
that
his
curiosity
could
no
longer
be
suppressed
.
--
``
Gentle
maiden
,
''
he
*NL*
began
in
the
Arabian
tongue
,
with
which
his
Eastern
travels
had
rendered
*NL*
him
familiar
,
and
which
he
thought
most
likely
to
be
understood
by
the
*NL*
turban
'd
and
caftan
'd
damsel
who
stood
before
him
--
``
I
pray
you
,
gentle
*NL*
maiden
,
of
your
courtesy
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
here
he
was
interrupted
by
his
fair
physician
,
a
smile
which
she
*NL*
could
scarce
suppress
dimpling
for
an
instant
a
face
,
whose
general
*NL*
expression
was
that
of
contemplative
melancholy
.
``
I
am
of
England
,
Sir
*NL*
Knight
,
and
speak
the
English
tongue
,
although
my
dress
and
my
lineage
*NL*
belong
to
another
climate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Noble
damsel
,
''
--
again
the
Knight
of
Ivanhoe
began
;
and
again
Rebecca
*NL*
hastened
to
interrupt
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bestow
not
on
me
,
Sir
Knight
,
''
she
said
,
``
the
epithet
of
noble
.
It
is
*NL*
well
you
should
speedily
know
that
your
handmaiden
is
a
poor
Jewess
,
the
*NL*
daughter
of
that
Isaac
of
York
,
to
whom
you
were
so
lately
a
good
and
*NL*
kind
lord
.
It
well
becomes
him
,
and
those
of
his
household
,
to
render
to
*NL*
you
such
careful
tendance
as
your
present
state
necessarily
demands
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
know
not
whether
the
fair
Rowena
would
have
been
altogether
satisfied
*NL*
with
the
species
of
emotion
with
which
her
devoted
knight
had
hitherto
*NL*
gazed
on
the
beautiful
features
,
and
fair
form
,
and
lustrous
eyes
,
of
*NL*
the
lovely
Rebecca
;
eyes
whose
brilliancy
was
shaded
,
and
,
as
it
were
,
*NL*
mellowed
,
by
the
fringe
of
her
long
silken
eyelashes
,
and
which
a
*NL*
minstrel
would
have
compared
to
the
evening
star
darting
its
rays
*NL*
through
a
bower
of
jessamine
.
But
Ivanhoe
was
too
good
a
Catholic
to
*NL*
retain
the
same
class
of
feelings
towards
a
Jewess
.
This
Rebecca
had
*NL*
foreseen
,
and
for
this
very
purpose
she
had
hastened
to
mention
her
*NL*
father
's
name
and
lineage
;
yet
--
for
the
fair
and
wise
daughter
of
Isaac
*NL*
was
not
without
a
touch
of
female
weakness
--
she
could
not
but
sigh
*NL*
internally
when
the
glance
of
respectful
admiration
,
not
altogether
*NL*
unmixed
with
tenderness
,
with
which
Ivanhoe
had
hitherto
regarded
his
*NL*
unknown
benefactress
,
was
exchanged
at
once
for
a
manner
cold
,
composed
,
*NL*
and
collected
,
and
fraught
with
no
deeper
feeling
than
that
which
*NL*
expressed
a
grateful
sense
of
courtesy
received
from
an
unexpected
*NL*
quarter
,
and
from
one
of
an
inferior
race
.
It
was
not
that
Ivanhoe
's
*NL*
former
carriage
expressed
more
than
that
general
devotional
homage
which
*NL*
youth
always
pays
to
beauty
;
yet
it
was
mortifying
that
one
word
should
*NL*
operate
as
a
spell
to
remove
poor
Rebecca
,
who
could
not
be
supposed
*NL*
altogether
ignorant
of
her
title
to
such
homage
,
into
a
degraded
class
,
*NL*
to
whom
it
could
not
be
honourably
rendered
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
gentleness
and
candour
of
Rebecca
's
nature
imputed
no
fault
to
*NL*
Ivanhoe
for
sharing
in
the
universal
prejudices
of
his
age
and
religion
.
*NL*
On
the
contrary
the
fair
Jewess
,
though
sensible
her
patient
now
*NL*
regarded
her
as
one
of
a
race
of
reprobation
,
with
whom
it
was
*NL*
disgraceful
to
hold
any
beyond
the
most
necessary
intercourse
,
ceased
*NL*
not
to
pay
the
same
patient
and
devoted
attention
to
his
safety
and
*NL*
convalescence
.
She
informed
him
of
the
necessity
they
were
under
of
*NL*
removing
to
York
,
and
of
her
father
's
resolution
to
transport
him
*NL*
thither
,
and
tend
him
in
his
own
house
until
his
health
should
be
*NL*
restored
.
Ivanhoe
expressed
great
repugnance
to
this
plan
,
which
he
*NL*
grounded
on
unwillingness
to
give
farther
trouble
to
his
benefactors
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
there
not
,
''
he
said
,
``
in
Ashby
,
or
near
it
,
some
Saxon
franklin
,
*NL*
or
even
some
wealthy
peasant
,
who
would
endure
the
burden
of
a
wounded
*NL*
countryman
's
residence
with
him
until
he
should
be
again
able
to
bear
*NL*
his
armour
?
--
Was
there
no
convent
of
Saxon
endowment
,
where
he
could
be
*NL*
received
?
--
Or
could
he
not
be
transported
as
far
as
Burton
,
where
he
was
*NL*
sure
to
find
hospitality
with
Waltheoff
,
the
Abbot
of
St
Withold
's
,
to
*NL*
whom
he
was
related
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Any
,
the
worst
of
these
harbourages
,
''
said
Rebecca
,
with
a
melancholy
*NL*
smile
,
``
would
unquestionably
be
more
fitting
for
your
residence
than
the
*NL*
abode
of
a
despised
Jew
;
yet
,
Sir
Knight
,
unless
you
would
dismiss
your
*NL*
physician

you
can
not
change
your
lodging

Our
nation
,
as
you
well
know

*NL*

cure
wounds

we
deal
not
in
inflicting
them

handed
down

stopt

replied
Rebecca

*NL*
*NL*
The
blood
which
Ivanhoe
had
lost
did
not
prevent
a
flush
from
crossing
*NL*
his
cheek

feeling
that
he
had
incautiously
betrayed
a
deep
interest
in
*NL*
Rowena
by
the
awkward
attempt
he
had
made
to
conceal
it

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*

Not

himself
upon

*NL*
``
Ha

''
exclaimed
the
knight
,
``
knowest
thou
his
name
?

But
thou
dost

''
he
*NL*
immediately
added
,
``
and
well
thou
mayst
,
for
it
was
from
thy
hand
,
and
,
*NL*
as
I
am
now
convinced
,
from
thine
own
generosity
of
spirit
,
that
he
*NL*
received
but
yesterday
a
hundred
zecchins
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak
not
of
that

''
said
Rebecca
,
blushing
deeply
;
``
I
see
how
easy
it
*NL*
is
for
the
tongue
to
betray
what
the
heart
would
gladly
conceal

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
this
sum
of
gold
,
''
said
Ivanhoe
,
gravely
,
``
my
honour
is
concerned
*NL*
in
repaying
it
to
your
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
it
be
as
thou
wilt
,
''
said
Rebecca
,
``
when
eight
days
have
passed
*NL*
away

think
not

not
now

of
aught

may
retard
thy
*NL*
recovery

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
it
so
,
kind
maiden
,
''
said
Ivanhoe
;
``
I
were
most
ungrateful
to
*NL*
dispute
thy
commands
.
But
one
word
of
the
fate
of
poor
Gurth
,
and
I
have
*NL*
done
with
questioning
thee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
grieve
to
tell
thee
,
Sir
Knight

''
answered
the
Jewess
,
``
that
he
is
in
*NL*
custody
by
the
order
of
Cedric
.
''
--
And
then
observing
the
distress
which
*NL*
her
communication
gave
to
Wilfred
,
she
instantly
added
,
``
But
the
steward
*NL*
Oswald
said
,
that
if
nothing
occurred
to
renew
his
master
's
displeasure
*NL*
against
him
,
he
was
sure
that
Cedric
would
pardon
Gurth
,
a
faithful
*NL*
serf
,
and
one
who
stood
high
in
favour
,
and
who
had
but
committed
*NL*
this
error
out
of
the
love
which
he
bore
to
Cedric
's
son
.
And
he
said
,
*NL*
moreover
,
that
he
and
his
comrades
,
and
especially
Wamba
the
Jester
,
*NL*
were
resolved
to
warn
Gurth
to
make
his
escape
by
the
way
,
in
case
*NL*
Cedric
's
ire
against
him
could
not
be
mitigated
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
to
God
they
may
keep
their
purpose
!
''
said
Ivanhoe
;
``
but
it
seems
*NL*
as
if
I
were
destined
to
bring
ruin
on
whomsoever
hath
shown
kindness
to

me
.
My
king
,
by
whom
I
was
honoured

distinguished
,
thou
seest
*NL*
that
the
brother
most
indebted
to
him
is
raising
his
arms
to
grasp
his
*NL*
crown
;

my
regard
hath
brought
restraint

on
the
fairest
of
*NL*
her
sex

now
my

in
his
mood
may
slay
this

loyal

to
me

Thou
seest
,
maiden
,
what
an
*NL*
ill-fated
wretch
thou
dost
labour
to
assist
;
be
wise
,
and
let
me
go
,
ere
*NL*
the
misfortunes
which
track
my
footsteps
like
slot-hounds

shall
involve
*NL*
thee
also

their
pursuit

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
''
said
Rebecca
,
``
thy
weakness
and
thy
grief
,
Sir
Knight

make
thee
*NL*
miscalculate
the
purposes
of
Heaven
.
Thou
hast
been
restored
to
thy
*NL*
country
when
it
most
needed
the
assistance
of
a
strong
hand
and
a
true
*NL*
heart
,
and
thou
hast
humbled
the
pride
of
thine
enemies
and
those
of
thy
*NL*
king
,
when
their
horn
was
most
highly
exalted

and
for
the
evil
which
*NL*
thou
hast
sustained
,
seest
thou
not
that
Heaven
has
raised
thee
a
helper
*NL*
and
a
physician
,
even
among
the
most
despised
of
the
land

Therefore
,
*NL*
be
of
good
courage

that
thou
art
preserved

Adieu

and
having
taken
*NL*
the
medicine
which
I
shall
send
thee
by
the
hand
of
Reuben
,
compose
*NL*
thyself
again
to
rest
,
that
thou
mayest
be
the
more
able
to
endure
the
*NL*
journey
on
the
succeeding
day

''
*NL*
*NL*
Ivanhoe
was
convinced
by
the
reasoning
,
and
obeyed
the
directions
,
of
*NL*
Rebecca
.
The
drought
which
Reuben
administered
was
of
a
sedative
*NL*
and
narcotic
quality
,
and
secured
the
patient
sound
and
undisturbed
*NL*
slumbers
.
In
the
morning
his
kind
physician
found
him
entirely
free
from
*NL*
feverish
symptoms
,
and
fit
to
undergo
the
fatigue
of
a
journey
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
deposited
in
the
horse-litter
which
had
brought
him
from
the
*NL*
lists
,
and
every
precaution
taken
for
his
travelling
with
ease
.
In
one
*NL*
circumstance
only
even
the
entreaties
of
Rebecca
were
unable
to
secure
*NL*
sufficient
attention
to
the
accommodation
of
the
wounded
knight
.
Isaac
,
*NL*
like
the
enriched
traveller
of
Juvenal
's
tenth
satire
,
had
ever
the
fear
*NL*
of
robbery
before
his
eyes
,
conscious
that
he
would
be
alike
accounted
*NL*
fair
game
by
the
marauding
Norman
noble
,
and
by
the
Saxon
outlaw
.
He
*NL*
therefore
journeyed
at
a
great
rate
,
and
made
short
halts
,
and
shorter
*NL*
repasts
,
so
that
he
passed
by
Cedric
and
Athelstane
who
had
several
*NL*
hours
the
start
of
him
,
but
who
had
been
delayed
by
their
protracted
*NL*
feasting
at
the
convent
of
Saint
Withold
's
.
Yet
such
was
the
virtue
of
*NL*
Miriam
's
balsam
,
or
such
the
strength
of
Ivanhoe
's
constitution
,
that
*NL*
he
did
not
sustain
from
the
hurried
journey
that
inconvenience
which
his
*NL*
kind
physician
had
apprehended
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
another
point
of
view
,
however
,
the
Jew
's
haste
proved
somewhat
more
*NL*
than
good
speed
.
The
rapidity
with
which
he
insisted
on
travelling
,
bred
*NL*
several
disputes
between
him
and
the
party
whom
he
had
hired
to
attend
*NL*
him
as
a
guard
.
These
men
were
Saxons
,
and
not
free
by
any
means
from
*NL*
the
national
love
of
ease
and
good
living
which
the
Normans
stigmatized
*NL*
as
laziness
and
gluttony
.
Reversing
Shylock
's
position
,
they
had
*NL*
accepted
the
employment
in
hopes
of
feeding
upon
the
wealthy
Jew
,
and
*NL*
were
very
much
displeased
when
they
found
themselves
disappointed
,
*NL*
by
the
rapidity
with
which
he
insisted
on
their
proceeding
.
They
*NL*
remonstrated
also
upon
the
risk
of
damage
to
their
horses
by
these
*NL*
forced
marches
.
Finally
,
there
arose
betwixt
Isaac
and
his
satellites
a
*NL*
deadly
feud
,
concerning
the
quantity
of
wine
and
ale
to
be
allowed
for
*NL*
consumption
at
each
meal
.
And
thus
it
happened
,
that
when
the
alarm
of
*NL*
danger
approached
,
and
that
which
Isaac
feared
was
likely
to
come
upon
*NL*
him
,
he
was
deserted
by
the
discontented
mercenaries
on
whose
protection
*NL*
he
had
relied
,
without
using
the
means
necessary
to
secure
their
*NL*
attachment
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
deplorable
condition
the
Jew
,
with
his
daughter
and
her
wounded
*NL*
patient
,
were
found
by
Cedric
,
as
has
already
been
noticed
,
and
soon
*NL*
afterwards
fell
into
the
power
of
De
Bracy
and
his
confederates
.
*NL*
Little
notice
was
at
first
taken
of
the
horse-litter
,
and
it
might
have
*NL*
remained
behind
but
for
the
curiosity
of
De
Bracy
,
who
looked
into
it
*NL*
under
the
impression
that
it
might
contain
the
object
of
his
enterprise
,
*NL*
for
Rowena
had
not
unveiled
herself
.
But
De
Bracy
's
astonishment
was
*NL*
considerable
,
when
he
discovered
that
the
litter
contained
a
wounded
*NL*
man
,
who
,
conceiving
himself
to
have
fallen
into
the
power
of
Saxon
*NL*
outlaws
,
with
whom
his
name
might
be
a
protection
for
himself
and
his
*NL*
friends
,
frankly
avowed
himself
to
be
Wilfred
of
Ivanhoe
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ideas
of
chivalrous
honour
,
which
,
amidst
his
wildness
and
levity
,
*NL*
never
utterly
abandoned
De
Bracy
,
prohibited
him
from
doing
the
knight
*NL*
any
injury
in
his
defenceless
condition
,
and
equally
interdicted
his
*NL*
betraying
him
to
Front-de-Boeuf
,
who
would
have
had
no
scruples
to
put
*NL*
to
death
,
under
any
circumstances
,
the
rival
claimant
of
the
fief
of
*NL*
Ivanhoe
.
On
the
other
hand
,
to
liberate
a
suitor
preferred
by
the
Lady
*NL*
Rowena
,
as
the
events
of
the
tournament
,
and
indeed
Wilfred
's
previous
*NL*
banishment
from
his
father
's
house
,
had
made
matter
of
notoriety
,
was
*NL*
a
pitch
far
above
the
flight
of
De
Bracy
's
generosity
.
A
middle
*NL*
course
betwixt
good
and
evil
was
all
which
he
found
himself
capable
of
*NL*
adopting
,
and
he
commanded
two
of
his
own
squires
to
keep
close
by
the
*NL*
litter
,
and
to
suffer
no
one
to
approach
it
.
If
questioned
,
they
were
*NL*
directed
by
their
master
to
say
,
that
the
empty
litter
of
the
Lady
*NL*
Rowena
was
employed
to
transport
one
of
their
comrades
who
had
been
*NL*
wounded
in
the
scuffle
.
On
arriving
at
Torquilstone
,
while
the
Knight
*NL*
Templar
and
the
lord
of
that
castle
were
each
intent
upon
their
own
*NL*
schemes
,
the
one
on
the
Jew
's
treasure
,
and
the
other
on
his
daughter
,
*NL*
De
Bracy
's
squires
conveyed
Ivanhoe
,
still
under
the
name
of
a
wounded
*NL*
comrade
,
to
a
distant
apartment
.
This
explanation
was
accordingly
*NL*
returned
by
these
men
to
Front-de-Boeuf
,
when
he
questioned
them
why
*NL*
they
did
not
make
for
the
battlements
upon
the
alarm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
wounded
companion
!
''
he
replied
in
great
wrath
and
astonishment
.
``
No
*NL*
wonder
that
churls
and
yeomen
wax
so
presumptuous
as
even
to
lay
leaguer
*NL*
before

and
that
clowns
and
swineherds
send
defiances
to
nobles
,
*NL*

to

assailed

he
exclaimed
,
*NL*
raising
his
stentorian
voice
till
the
arches
around
rung
again
,
``
to
the
*NL*
battlements

I
will
splinter
your
bones

The
men
sulkily
replied
,
``

;

The
men
,
who
,
like
most
of
their
description
,
were
fond
of
enterprise
*NL*
and
detested
inaction
,
went
joyfully
to
the
scene
of
danger
as
they
were
*NL*
commanded
,
and
thus
the
charge
of
Ivanhoe
was
transferred
to
Urfried

*NL*
or
Ulrica
.
But
she
,
whose
brain
was
burning
with
remembrance
of
injuries

with
hopes
of
vengeance
,
was
readily
induced

,
valiant
soldier
,
*NL*
Look
on
the
field
,
and
say
how
goes
the
battle

*NL*
--
Schiller
's
Maid
of
Orleans
*NL*
*NL*
A
moment
of
peril
is
often
also
a
moment
of
open-hearted
kindness
and
*NL*
affection
.
We
are
thrown
off
our
guard
by
the
general
agitation
of
our
*NL*
feelings
,
and
betray
the
intensity
of
those
,
which
,
at
more
tranquil
*NL*
periods
,
our
prudence
at
least
conceals
,
if
it
can
not
altogether
*NL*
suppress
them
.
In
finding
herself
once
more
by
the
side
of
Ivanhoe
,
*NL*
Rebecca
was
astonished
at
the
keen
sensation
of
pleasure
which
she
*NL*
experienced
,
even
at
a
time
when
all
around
them
both
was
danger
,
if
not
*NL*
despair
.
As
she
felt
his
pulse
,
and
enquired
after
his
health
,
there
was
*NL*
a
softness
in
her
touch
and
in
her
accents
implying
a
kinder
interest
*NL*
than
she
would
herself
have
been
pleased
to
have
voluntarily
expressed
.
*NL*
Her
voice
faltered
and
her
hand
trembled
,
and
it
was
only
the
cold
*NL*
question
of
Ivanhoe
,
``
Is
it
you
,
gentle
maiden
?
''
which
recalled
her
to
*NL*
herself
,
and
reminded
her
the
sensations
which
she
felt
were
not
and
*NL*
could
not
be
mutual
.
A
sigh
escaped
,
but
it
was
scarce
audible
;
and
the
*NL*
questions
which
she
asked
the
knight
concerning
his
state
of
health
were
*NL*
put
in
the
tone
of
calm
friendship
.
Ivanhoe
answered
her
hastily
that
*NL*
he
was
,
in
point
of
health
,
as
well
,
and
better
than
he
could
have
*NL*
expected
--
``
Thanks
,
''
he
said
,
``
dear
Rebecca
,
to
thy
helpful
skill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
calls
me
DEAR
Rebecca
,
''
said
the
maiden
to
herself
,
``
but
it
is
in
*NL*
the
cold
and
careless
tone
which
ill
suits
the
word
.
His
war-horse
--
his
*NL*
hunting
hound
,
are
dearer
to
him
than
the
despised
Jewess
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
mind
,
gentle
maiden
,
''
continued
Ivanhoe
,
``
is
more
disturbed
by
*NL*
anxiety
,
than
my
body
with
pain
.
From
the
speeches
of
those
men
who
*NL*
were
my
warders
just
now
,
I
learn
that
I
am
a
prisoner
,
and
,
if
I
judge
*NL*
aright
of
the
loud
hoarse
voice
which
even
now
dispatched
them
hence
*NL*
on
some
military
duty
,
I
am
in
the
castle
of
Front-de-Boeuf
--
If
so
,
how
*NL*
will
this
end
,
or
how
can
I
protect
Rowena
and
my
father
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
names
not
the
Jew
or
Jewess
,
''
said
Rebecca
internally
;
``
yet
what
is
*NL*
our
portion
in
him
,
and
how
justly
am

punished
by
Heaven
for
*NL*
letting
my
thoughts
dwell
upon
him
!
''
She
hastened
after
this
brief
*NL*
self-accusation
to
give
Ivanhoe
what
information
she
could
;
but
it
*NL*
amounted
only
to
this
,
that
the
Templar
Bois-Guilbert
,
and
the
*NL*
Baron
Front-de-Boeuf
,
were
commanders
within
the
castle
;
that
it
was
*NL*
beleaguered
from
without
,
but
by
whom
she
knew
not
.
She
added
,
that
*NL*
there
was
a
Christian
priest
within
the
castle
who
might
be
possessed
of
*NL*
more
information
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
Christian
priest
!
''
said
the
knight
,
joyfully
;
``
fetch
him
hither
,
*NL*
Rebecca
,
if
thou
canst
--
say
a
sick
man
desires
his
ghostly
counsel
--
say
*NL*
what
thou
wilt
,
but
bring
him
--
something
I
must
do
or
attempt
,
but
how
*NL*
can
I
determine
until
I
know
how
matters
stand
without
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rebecca
in
compliance
with
the
wishes
of
Ivanhoe
,
made
that
attempt
to
*NL*
bring
Cedric
into
the
wounded
Knight
's
chamber
,
which
was
defeated
as
we
*NL*
have
already
seen
by
the
interference
of
Urfried
,
who
had
also
been
on
*NL*
the
watch
to
intercept
the
supposed
monk
.
Rebecca
retired
to
communicate
*NL*
to
Ivanhoe
the
result
of
her
errand
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
not
much
leisure
to
regret
the
failure
of
this
source
of
*NL*
intelligence
,
or
to
contrive
by
what
means
it
might
be
supplied
;
for
the
*NL*
noise
within
the
castle
,
occasioned
by
the
defensive
preparations
which
*NL*
had
been
considerable
for
some
time
,
now
increased
into
tenfold
bustle
*NL*
and
clamour
.
The
heavy
,
yet
hasty
step
of
the
men-at-arms
,
traversed
the
*NL*
battlements
or
resounded
on
the
narrow
and
winding
passages
and
stairs
*NL*
which
led
to
the
various
bartisans
and
points
of
defence
.
The
voices
of
*NL*
the
knights
were
heard
,
animating
their
followers
,
or
directing
means
*NL*
of
defence
,
while
their
commands
were
often
drowned
in
the
clashing
of
*NL*
armour
,
or
the
clamorous
shouts
of
those
whom
they
addressed
.
Tremendous
*NL*
as
these
sounds
were
,
and
yet
more
terrible
from
the
awful
event
which
*NL*
they
presaged
,
there
was
a
sublimity
mixed
with
them
,
which
Rebecca
's
*NL*
high-toned
mind
could
feel
even
in
that
moment
of
terror
.
Her
eye
*NL*
kindled
,
although
the
blood
fled
from
her
cheeks
;
and
there
was
a
*NL*
strong
mixture
of
fear
,
and
of
a
thrilling
sense
of
the
sublime
,
as
she
*NL*
repeated
,
half
whispering
to
herself
,
half
speaking
to
her
companion
,
*NL*
the
sacred
text
,
--
``
The
quiver
rattleth
--
the
glittering
spear
and
the
*NL*
shield
--
the
noise
of
the
captains
and
the
shouting
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Ivanhoe
was
like
the
war-horse
of
that
sublime
passage
,
glowing
with
*NL*
impatience
at
his
inactivity
,
and
with
his
ardent
desire
to
mingle
in
*NL*
the
affray
of
which
these
sounds
were
the
introduction
.
``
If
I
could
*NL*
but
drag
myself
,
''
he
said
,
``
to
yonder
window
,
that
I
might
see
how
*NL*
this
brave
game
is
like
to
go
--
If
I
had
but
bow
to
shoot
a
shaft
,
or
*NL*
battle-axe
to
strike
were
it
but
a
single
blow
for
our
deliverance
!
--
It
*NL*
is
in
vain
--
it
is
in
vain
--
I
am
alike
nerveless
and
weaponless
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fret
not
thyself
,
noble
knight
,
''
answered
Rebecca
,
``
the
sounds
have
*NL*
ceased
of
a
sudden
--
it
may
be
they
join
not
battle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
knowest
nought
of
it
,
''
said
Wilfred
,
impatiently
;
``
this
dead
pause
*NL*
only
shows
that
the
men
are
at
their
posts
on
the
walls
,
and
expecting
*NL*
an
instant
attack
;
what
we
have
heard
was
but
the
instant
muttering
of
*NL*
the
storm
--
it
will
burst
anon
in
all
its
fury
.
--
Could
I
but
reach
yonder
*NL*
window
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
wilt
but
injure
thyself
by
the
attempt
,
noble
knight
,
''
replied
his
*NL*
attendant
.
Observing
his
extreme
solicitude
,
she
firmly
added
,
``
I
myself
*NL*
will
stand
at
the
lattice
,
and
describe
to
you
as
I
can
what
passes
*NL*
without
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
not
--
you
shall
not
!
''
exclaimed
Ivanhoe
;
``
each
lattice
,
each
*NL*
aperture
,
will
be
soon
a
mark
for
the
archers
;
some
random
shaft
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
shall
be
welcome
!
''
murmured
Rebecca
,
as
with
firm
pace
she
ascended
*NL*
two
or
three
steps
,
which
led
to
the
window
of
which
they
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rebecca
,
dear
Rebecca
!
''
exclaimed
Ivanhoe
,
``
this
is
no
maiden
's
*NL*
pastime
--
do
not
expose
thyself
to
wounds
and
death
,
and
render
me
for
*NL*
ever
miserable
for
having
given
the
occasion
;
at
least
,
cover
thyself
*NL*
with
yonder
ancient
buckler
,
and
show
as
little
of
your
person
at
the
*NL*
lattice
as
may
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Following
with
wonderful
promptitude
the
directions
of
Ivanhoe
,
and
*NL*
availing
herself
of
the
protection
of
the
large
ancient
shield
,
which
*NL*
she
placed
against
the
lower
part
of
the
window
,
Rebecca
,
with
tolerable
*NL*
security
to
herself
,
could
witness
part
of
what
was
passing
without
the
*NL*
castle
,
and
report
to
Ivanhoe
the
preparations
which
the
assailants
were
*NL*
making
for
the
storm
.
Indeed
the
situation
which
she
thus
obtained
was
*NL*
peculiarly
favourable
for
this
purpose
,
because
,
being
placed
on
an
*NL*
angle
of
the
main
building
,
Rebecca
could
not
only
see
what
passed
*NL*
beyond
the
precincts
of
the
castle
,
but
also
commanded
a
view
of
the
*NL*
outwork
likely
to
be
the
first
object
of
the
meditated
assault
.
It
was
*NL*
an
exterior
fortification
of
no
great
height
or
strength
,
intended
*NL*
to
protect
the
postern-gate
,
through
which
Cedric
had
been
recently
*NL*
dismissed
by
Front-de-Boeuf
.
The
castle
moat
divided
this
species
of
*NL*
barbican
from
the
rest
of
the
fortress
,
so
that
,
in
case
of
its
being
*NL*
taken
,
it
was
easy
to
cut
off
the
communication
with
the
main
building
,
*NL*
by
withdrawing
the
temporary
bridge
.
In
the
outwork
was
a
sallyport
*NL*
corresponding
to
the
postern
of
the
castle
,
and
the
whole
was
surrounded
*NL*
by
a
strong
palisade
.
Rebecca
could
observe
,
from
the
number
of
men
*NL*
placed
for
the
defence
of
this
post
,
that
the
besieged
entertained
*NL*
apprehensions
for
its
safety
;
and
from
the
mustering
of
the
assailants
*NL*
in
a
direction
nearly
opposite
to
the
outwork
,
it
seemed
no
less
plain
*NL*
that
it
had
been
selected
as
a
vulnerable
point
of
attack
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
appearances
she
hastily
communicated
to
Ivanhoe
,
and
added
,
``
The
*NL*
skirts
of
the
wood
seem
lined
with
archers
,
although
only
a
few
are
*NL*
advanced
from
its
dark
shadow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Under
what
banner
?
''
asked
Ivanhoe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Under
no
ensign
of
war
which
I
can
observe
,
''
answered
Rebecca
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
singular
novelty
,
''
muttered
the
knight
,
``
to
advance
to
storm
such
a
*NL*
castle
without
pennon
or
banner
displayed
!
--
Seest
thou
who
they
be
that
*NL*
act
as
leaders
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
knight
,
clad
in
sable
armour
,
is
the
most
conspicuous
,
''
said
the
*NL*
Jewess
;
``
he
alone
is
armed
from
head
to
heel
,
and
seems
to
assume
the
*NL*
direction
of
all
around
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
device
does
he
bear
on
his
shield
?
''
replied
Ivanhoe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Something
resembling
a
bar
of
iron
,
and
a
padlock
painted
blue
on
the
*NL*
black
shield
.
''
-LSB-
35
-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
fetterlock
and
shacklebolt
azure
,
''
said
Ivanhoe
;
``
I
know
not
who
may
*NL*
bear
the
device
,
but
well
I
ween
it
might
now
be
mine
own
.
Canst
thou
*NL*
not
see
the
motto
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Scarce
the
device
itself
at
this
distance
,
''
replied
Rebecca
;
``
but
when
*NL*
the
sun
glances
fair
upon
his
shield
,
it
shows
as
I
tell
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Seem
there
no
other
leaders
?
''
exclaimed
the
anxious
enquirer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
None
of
mark
and
distinction
that
I
can
behold
from
this
station
,
''
said
*NL*
Rebecca
;
``
but
,
doubtless
,
the
other
side
of
the
castle
is
also
assailed
.
*NL*
They
appear
even
now
preparing
to
advance
--
God
of
Zion
,
protect
*NL*
us
!
--
What
a
dreadful
sight
!
--
Those
who
advance
first
bear
huge
shields
*NL*
and
defences
made
of
plank
;
the
others
follow
,
bending
their
bows
*NL*
as
they
come
on
.
--
They
raise
their
bows
!
--
God
of
Moses
,
forgive
the
*NL*
creatures
thou
hast
made
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
description
was
here
suddenly
interrupted
by
the
signal
for
assault
,
*NL*
which
was
given
by
the
blast
of
a
shrill
bugle
,
and
at
once
answered
by
*NL*
a
flourish
of
the
Norman
trumpets
from
the
battlements
,
which
,
*NL*
mingled
with
the
deep
and
hollow
clang
of
the
nakers
,
-LRB-
a
species
of
*NL*
kettle-drum
,
-RRB-
retorted
in
notes
of
defiance
the
challenge
of
the
enemy
.
*NL*
The
shouts
of
both
parties
augmented
the
fearful
din
,
the
assailants
*NL*
crying
,
``
Saint
George
for
merry
England
!
''
and
the
Normans
answering
*NL*
them
with
loud
cries
of
``
En
avant
De
Bracy
!
--
Beau-seant
!
*NL*
Beau-seant
!
--
Front-de-Boeuf
a
la
rescousse
!
''
according
to
the
war-cries
*NL*
of
their
different
commanders
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
,
however
,
by
clamour
that
the
contest
was
to
be
decided
,
and
*NL*
the
desperate
efforts
of
the
assailants
were
met
by
an
equally
vigorous
*NL*
defence
on
the
part
of
the
besieged
.
The
archers
,
trained
by
their
*NL*
woodland
pastimes
to
the
most
effective
use
of
the
long-bow
,
shot
,
to
*NL*
use
the
appropriate
phrase
of
the
time
,
so
``
wholly
together
,
''
that
*NL*
no
point
at
which
a
defender
could
show
the
least
part
of
his
person
,
*NL*
escaped
their
cloth-yard
shafts
.
By
this
heavy
discharge
,
which
*NL*
continued
as
thick
and
sharp
as
hail
,
while
,
notwithstanding
,
every
*NL*
arrow
had
its
individual
aim
,
and
flew
by
scores
together
against
each
*NL*
embrasure
and
opening
in
the
parapets
,
as
well
as
at
every
window
where
*NL*
a
defender
either
occasionally
had
post
,
or
might
be
suspected
to
be
*NL*
stationed
,
--
by
this
sustained
discharge
,
two
or
three
of
the
garrison
*NL*
were
slain
,
and
several
others
wounded
.
But
,
confident
in
their
armour
*NL*
of
proof
,
and
in
the
cover
which
their
situation
afforded
,
the
followers
*NL*
of
Front-de-Boeuf
,
and
his
allies
,
showed
an
obstinacy
in
defence
*NL*
proportioned
to
the
fury
of
the
attack
and
replied
with
the
discharge
*NL*
of
their
large
cross-bows
,
as
well
as
with
their
long-bows
,
slings
,
and
*NL*
other
missile
weapons
,
to
the
close
and
continued
shower
of
arrows
;
*NL*
and
,
as
the
assailants
were
necessarily
but
indifferently
protected
,
did
*NL*
considerably
more
damage
than
they
received
at
their
hand
.
The
whizzing
*NL*
of
shafts
and
of
missiles
,
on
both
sides
,
was
only
interrupted
by
the
*NL*
shouts
which
arose
when
either
side
inflicted
or
sustained
some
notable
*NL*
loss
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
must
lie
here
like
a
bedridden
monk
,
''
exclaimed
Ivanhoe
,
``
while
*NL*
the
game
that
gives
me
freedom

death

played
out

out
once

tell

me

*NL*
*NL*
With
patient
courage
,
strengthened
by
the
interval
which
she
had
*NL*
employed
in
mental
devotion
,
Rebecca
again
took
post
at
the
lattice
,
*NL*
sheltering
herself
,
however
,
so
as
not
to
be
visible
from
beneath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
dost
thou
see

Rebecca

again
demanded
the
wounded
knight

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing

the
cloud

arrows

thick

mine

bowmen

shoot
them

*NL*

Ivanhoe

Rebecca

I
see

Old
Play
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
interval
of
quiet
which
followed
the
first
success
of
the
*NL*
besiegers
,
while
the
one
party
was
preparing
to
pursue
their
advantage
,
*NL*
and
the
other
to
strengthen
their
means
of
defence
,
the
Templar
and
De
*NL*
Bracy
held
brief
council
together
in
the
hall
of
the
castle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
Front-de-Boeuf
?
''
said
the
latter
,
who
had
superintended
the
*NL*
defence
of
the
fortress
on
the
other
side
;
``
men
say
he
hath
been
slain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
lives
,
''
said
the
Templar
,
coolly
,
``
lives
as
yet
;
but
had
he
worn
the
*NL*
bull
's
head
of
which
he
bears
the
name
,
and
ten
plates
of
iron
to
fence
*NL*
it
withal
,
he
must
have
gone
down
before
yonder
fatal
axe
.
Yet
a
few
*NL*
hours
,
and
Front-de-Boeuf
is
with
his
fathers
--
a
powerful
limb
lopped
*NL*
off
Prince
John
's
enterprise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
a
brave
addition
to
the
kingdom
of
Satan
,
''
said
De
Bracy
;
``
this
*NL*
comes
of
reviling
saints
and
angels
,
and
ordering
images
of
holy
things
*NL*
and
holy
men
to
be
flung
down
on
the
heads
of
these
rascaille
yeomen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
to
--
thou
art
a
fool
,
''
said
the
Templar
;
``
thy
superstition
is
upon
a
*NL*
level
with
Front-de-Boeuf
's
want
of
faith
;
neither
of
you
can
render
a
*NL*
reason
for
your
belief
or
unbelief
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Benedicite
,
Sir
Templar
,
''
replied
De
Bracy
,
``
pray
you
to
keep
better

rule
with
your
tongue

I
am
the
theme
of
it

I
am
a
better
Christian

than
thou

for

the

shrewdly
out

that
the
most
holy
Order

Temple
*NL*
of
Zion
nurseth
not
a
few
heretics
within
its
bosom
,
and
that
Sir
Brian
*NL*
de
Bois-Guilbert
is
of
the
number
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Care
not
thou
for
such
reports
,
''
said
the
Templar
;
``
but
let
us
think
of
*NL*
making
good
the
castle
.
--
How
fought
these
villain
yeomen
on
thy
side
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
fiends
incarnate
,
''
said
De
Bracy
.
``
They
swarmed
close
up
to
*NL*
the
walls
,
headed
,
as
I
think
,
by
the
knave
who
won
the
prize
at
the
*NL*
archery
,
for
I
knew
his
horn
and
baldric
.
And
this
is
old
Fitzurse
's
*NL*
boasted
policy
,
encouraging
these
malapert
knaves
to
rebel
against
us
!
*NL*
Had
I
not
been
armed
in
proof
,
the
villain
had
marked
me
down
seven
*NL*
times
with
as
little
remorse
as
if
I
had
been
a
buck
in
season
.
He
told
*NL*
every
rivet
on
my
armour
with
a
cloth-yard
shaft
,
that
rapped
against
*NL*
my
ribs
with
as
little
compunction
as
if
my
bones
had
been
of
iron
--
But
*NL*
that
I
wore
a
shirt
of
Spanish
mail
under
my
plate-coat
,
I
had
been
*NL*
fairly
sped
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
maintained
your
post
?
''
said
the
Templar
.
``
We
lost
the
outwork
*NL*
on
our
part
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
a
shrewd
loss
,
''
said
De
Bracy
;
``
the
knaves
will
find
cover
*NL*
there
to
assault
the
castle
more
closely
,
and
may
,
if
not
well
watched
,
*NL*
gain
some
unguarded
corner
of
a
tower
,
or
some
forgotten
window
,
and
*NL*
so
break
in
upon
us
.
Our
numbers
are
too
few
for
the
defence
of
every
*NL*
point
,
and
the
men
complain
that
they
can
nowhere
show
themselves
,
but
*NL*
they
are
the
mark
for
as
many
arrows
as
a
parish-butt
on
a
holyday
even
.
*NL*
Front-de-Boeuf
is
dying
too
,
so
we
shall
receive
no
more
aid
from
his
*NL*
bull
's
head
and
brutal
strength
.
How
think
you
,
Sir
Brian
,
were
we
*NL*
not
better
make
a
virtue
of
necessity
,
and
compound
with
the
rogues
by
*NL*
delivering
up
our
prisoners
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
?
''
exclaimed
the
Templar
;
``
deliver
up
our
prisoners
,
and
stand
an
*NL*
object
alike
of
ridicule
and
execration
,
as
the
doughty
warriors
who
*NL*
dared
by
a
night-attack
to
possess
themselves
of
the
persons
of
a
party
*NL*
of
defenceless
travellers
,
yet
could
not
make
good
a
strong
castle
*NL*
against
a
vagabond
troop
of
outlaws
,
led
by
swineherds
,
jesters
,
and
the
*NL*
very
refuse
of
mankind
?
--
Shame
on
thy
counsel
,
Maurice
de
Bracy
!

The
*NL*
ruins
of
this
castle
shall
bury
both
my
body
and
my
shame
,
ere
I
consent
*NL*
to
such
base
and
dishonourable
composition
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
to
the
walls
,
then
,
''
said
De
Bracy
,
carelessly
;
``
that
man
never
*NL*
breathed

be
he
Turk

who
held
life
at
lighter
rate

But
I
trust
there
is
no
dishonour
in
wishing
I
had
here
some
two
*NL*
scores
of
my
gallant
troop
of
Free
Companions
?

Oh

brave
lances
!
if
*NL*
ye
knew
but
how
hard
your
captain
were
this
day
bested
,
how
soon
should
*NL*
I
see
my
banner
at
the
head
of
your
clump
of
spears
!
And
how
short
while
*NL*
would
these
rabble
villains
stand
to
endure
your
encounter
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wish
for
whom
thou
wilt
,
''
said
the
Templar
,
``
but
let
us
make
*NL*
what
defence
we
can
with
the
soldiers
who
remain
--
They
are
chiefly
*NL*
Front-de-Boeuf
's
followers
,
hated
by
the
English
for
a
thousand
acts
of
*NL*
insolence
and
oppression
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
better
,
''
said
De
Bracy
;
``
the
rugged
slaves
will
defend
themselves
*NL*
to
the
last
drop
of
their
blood
,
ere
they
encounter
the
revenge
of
the
*NL*
peasants
without
.
Let
us
up
and
be
doing
,
then
,
Brian
de
Bois-Guilbert
;
*NL*
and
,
live
or
die
,
thou
shalt
see
Maurice
de
Bracy
bear
himself
this
day
*NL*
as
a
gentleman
of
blood
and
lineage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
walls
!
''
answered
the
Templar
;
and
they
both
ascended
the
*NL*
battlements
to
do
all
that
skill
could
dictate
,
and
manhood
accomplish
,
*NL*
in
defence
of
the
place
.
They
readily
agreed
that
the
point
of
greatest
*NL*
danger
was
that
opposite
to
the
outwork
of
which
the
assailants
had
*NL*
possessed
themselves
.
The
castle
,
indeed
,
was
divided
from
that
barbican
*NL*
by
the
moat
,
and
it
was
impossible
that
the
besiegers
could
assail
the
*NL*
postern-door
,
with
which
the
outwork
corresponded
,
without
surmounting
*NL*
that
obstacle
;
but
it
was
the
opinion
both
of
the
Templar
and
De
Bracy
,
*NL*
that
the
besiegers
,
if
governed
by
the
same
policy
their
leader
had
*NL*
already
displayed
,
would
endeavour
,
by
a
formidable
assault
,
to
draw
*NL*
the
chief
part
of
the
defenders
'
observation
to
this
point
,
and
take
*NL*
measures
to
avail
themselves
of
every
negligence
which
might
take
place
*NL*
in
the
defence
elsewhere
.
To
guard
against
such
an
evil
,
their
numbers
*NL*
only
permitted
the
knights
to
place
sentinels
from
space
to
space
along
*NL*
the
walls
in
communication
with
each
other
,
who
might
give
the
alarm
*NL*
whenever
danger
was
threatened
.
Meanwhile
,
they
agreed
that
De
Bracy
*NL*
should
command
the
defence
at
the
postern
,
and
the
Templar
should
keep
*NL*
with
him
a
score
of
men
or
thereabouts
as
a
body
of
reserve
,
ready
to
*NL*
hasten
to
any
other
point
which
might
be
suddenly
threatened
.
The
loss
*NL*
of
the
barbican
had
also
this
unfortunate
effect
,
that
,
notwithstanding
*NL*
the
superior
height
of
the
castle
walls
,
the
besieged
could
not
see
from
*NL*
them
,
with
the
same
precision
as
before
,
the
operations
of
the
enemy
;
*NL*
for
some
straggling
underwood
approached
so
near
the
sallyport
of
the
*NL*
outwork
,
that
the
assailants
might
introduce
into
it
whatever
force
they
*NL*
thought
proper
,
not
only
under
cover
,
but
even
without
the
knowledge
of
*NL*
the
defenders
.
Utterly
uncertain
,
therefore
,
upon
what
point
the
storm
*NL*
was
to
burst
,
De
Bracy
and
his
companion
were
under
the
necessity
of
*NL*
providing
against
every
possible
contingency
,
and
their
followers
,
*NL*
however
brave
,
experienced
the
anxious
dejection
of
mind
incident
to
men
*NL*
enclosed
by
enemies
,
who
possessed
the
power
of
choosing
their
time
and
*NL*
mode
of
attack
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
the
lord
of
the
beleaguered
and
endangered
castle
lay
upon
*NL*
a
bed
of
bodily
pain
and
mental
agony
.
He
had
not
the
usual
resource
of
*NL*
bigots
in
that
superstitious
period
,
most
of
whom
were
wont
to
atone
for
*NL*
the
crimes
they
were
guilty
of
by
liberality
to
the
church
,
stupefying
*NL*
by
this
means
their
terrors
by
the
idea
of
atonement
and
forgiveness
;
*NL*
and
although
the
refuge
which
success
thus
purchased
,
was
no
more
like
*NL*
to
the
peace
of
mind
which
follows
on
sincere
repentance
,
than
the
*NL*
turbid
stupefaction
procured
by
opium
resembles
healthy
and
natural
*NL*
slumbers
,
it
was
still
a
state
of
mind
preferable
to
the
agonies
of
*NL*
awakened
remorse
.
But
among
the
vices
of
Front-de-Boeuf
,
a
hard
and
*NL*
griping
man
,
avarice
was
predominant
;
and
he
preferred
setting
church
*NL*
and
churchmen
at
defiance
,
to
purchasing
from
them
pardon
and
absolution
*NL*
at
the
price
of
treasure
and
of
manors
.
Nor
did
the
Templar
,
an
infidel
*NL*
of
another
stamp
,
justly
characterise
his
associate
,
when
he
said
*NL*
Front-de-Boeuf
could
assign
no
cause
for
his
unbelief
and
contempt
for
*NL*
the
established
faith
;
for
the
Baron
would
have
alleged
that
the
Church
*NL*
sold
her
wares
too
dear
,
that
the
spiritual
freedom
which
she
put
up
to
*NL*
sale
was
only
to
be
bought
like
that
of
the
chief
captain
of
Jerusalem
,
*NL*
``
with
a
great
sum
,
''
and
Front-de-Boeuf
preferred
denying
the
virtue
of
*NL*
the
medicine
,
to
paying
the
expense
of
the
physician
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
moment
had
now
arrived
when
earth
and
all
his
treasures
were
*NL*
gliding
from
before
his
eyes
,
and
when
the
savage
Baron
's
heart
,
though
*NL*
hard
as
a
nether
millstone
,
became
appalled
as
he
gazed
forward
into
the
*NL*
waste
darkness
of
futurity
.
The
fever
of
his
body
aided
the
impatience
*NL*
and
agony
of
his
mind
,
and
his
death-bed
exhibited
a
mixture
of
*NL*
the
newly
awakened
feelings
of
horror
,
combating
with
the
fixed
and
*NL*
inveterate
obstinacy
of
his
disposition
;
--
a
fearful
state
of
mind
,
only
*NL*
to
be
equalled
in
those
tremendous
regions
,
where
there
are
complaints
*NL*
without
hope
,
remorse
without
repentance
,
a
dreadful
sense
of
present
*NL*
agony
,
and
a
presentiment
that
it
can
not
cease
or
be
diminished
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
be
these
dog-priests
now
,
''
growled
the
Baron
,
``
who
set
such
price
*NL*
on
their
ghostly
mummery
?
--
where
be
all
those
unshod
Carmelites
,
for

whom
old
Front-de-Boeuf
founded
the
convent
of
St
Anne
,
robbing
his
heir
*NL*
of
many
a
fair
rood
of
meadow
,
and
many
a
fat
field

close

greedy

hither

may
do
something

no

myself

Brian
de
Bois-Guilbert

recks
neither
of

of
hell

I
have
heard
old
men
talk
of

by
their
own
voice

Such

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lives
Reginald
Front-de-Boeuf

''
said
a
broken
and
shrill
voice
close
by
*NL*
his
bedside
,
``
to
say
there
is
that

*NL*
*NL*
The
evil
conscience
and
the
shaken
nerves
of
Front-de-Boeuf
heard
,
in
*NL*
this
strange
interruption
to
his
soliloquy
,
the
voice
of
one
of
those
*NL*
demons
,
who
,
as
the
superstition
of
the
times
believed
,
beset
the
*NL*
beds
of
dying
men
to
distract
their
thoughts
,
and
turn
them
from
the
*NL*
meditations
which
concerned
their
eternal
welfare

He
shuddered
and
drew
*NL*
himself
together
;
but
,
instantly
summoning
up
his
wonted
resolution
,
he
*NL*
exclaimed
,
``

she
left

Front-de-Boeuf
could
hear
the
*NL*
crash
of
the
ponderous
key

as
she
locked

double-locked
the
door

behind
her

thus
cutting
off
the
most
slender
chance
of
escape

In
the
*NL*
extremity

agony
he
shouted
upon

rang
again

Front-de-Boeuf

in
altered

not

returning

omitted
not

the
Black
Knight
and
Locksley

They
were
*NL*
well
pleased
to
find

had
a
friend
within
the
place
,
who
might

in

the
moment
of
need

be
able
to
facilitate
their
entrance

and
readily
*NL*
agreed
with
the
Saxon
that
a
storm

under

to
be
attempted

as
the
only
means

''
said
the
Friar
;
``
what
,
sirs
!
I
trust
well
that
a
*NL*
fool
--
I
mean
,
d'ye
see
me
,
sirs
,
a
fool
that
is
free
of
his
guild
and
*NL*
master
of
his
craft
,
and
can
give
as
much
relish
and
flavour
to
a
cup
of
*NL*
wine
as
ever
a
flitch
of
bacon
can
--
I
say
,
brethren
,
such
a
fool
shall
*NL*
never
want
a
wise
clerk
to
pray
for
or
fight
for
him
at
a
strait
,
while
*NL*
I
can
say
a
mass
or
flourish
a
partisan
.
''
And
with
that
he
made
his
*NL*
heavy
halberd
to
play
around
his
head
as
a
shepherd
boy
flourishes
his
*NL*
light
crook
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
,
Holy
Clerk
,
''
said
the
Black
Knight
,
``
true
as
if
Saint
Dunstan
*NL*
himself
had
said
it
.
--
And
now
,
good
Locksley
,
were
it
not
well
that
*NL*
noble
Cedric
should
assume
the
direction
of
this
assault
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
jot
I
,
''
returned
Cedric
;
``
I
have
never
been
wont
to
study
either
*NL*
how
to
take
or
how
to
hold
out
those
abodes
of
tyrannic
power
,
which
*NL*
the
Normans
have
erected
in
this
groaning
land
.
I
will
fight
among
the
*NL*
foremost
;
but
my
honest
neighbours
well
know
I
am
not
a
trained
soldier
*NL*
in
the
discipline
of
wars
,
or
the
attack
of
strongholds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Since
it
stands
thus
with
noble
Cedric
,
''
said
Locksley
,
``
I
am
most
*NL*
willing
to
take
on
me
the
direction
of
the
archery
;
and
ye
shall
hang
*NL*
me
up
on
my
own
Trysting-tree
,
an
the
defenders
be
permitted
to
show
*NL*
themselves
over
the
walls
without
being
stuck
with
as
many
shafts
as
*NL*
there
are
cloves
in
a
gammon
of
bacon
at
Christmas
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
said
,
stout
yeoman
,
''
answered
the
Black
Knight
;
``
and
if
I
be
*NL*
thought
worthy
to
have
a
charge
in
these
matters
,
and
can
find
among
*NL*
these
brave
men
as
many
as
are
willing
to
follow
a
true
English
knight
,
*NL*
for
so
I
may
surely
call
myself
,
I
am
ready
,
with
such
skill
as
my
*NL*
experience
has
taught
me
,
to
lead
them
to
the
attack
of
these
walls
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
parts
being
thus
distributed
to
the
leaders
,
they
commenced
the
*NL*
first
assault
,
of
which
the
reader
has
already
heard
the
issue
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
barbican
was
carried
,
the
Sable
Knight
sent
notice
of
the
*NL*
happy
event
to
Locksley
,
requesting
him
at
the
same
time
,
to
keep
such
*NL*
a
strict
observation
on
the
castle
as
might
prevent
the
defenders
from
*NL*
combining
their
force
for
a
sudden
sally
,
and
recovering
the
outwork
*NL*
which
they
had
lost
.
This
the
knight
was
chiefly
desirous
of
avoiding
,
*NL*
conscious
that
the
men
whom
he
led
,
being
hasty
and
untrained
*NL*
volunteers
,
imperfectly
armed
and
unaccustomed
to
discipline
,
must
,
upon
*NL*
any
sudden
attack
,
fight
at
great
disadvantage
with
the
veteran
soldiers
*NL*
of
the
Norman
knights
,
who
were
well
provided
with
arms
both
defensive
*NL*
and
offensive
;
and
who
,
to
match
the
zeal
and
high
spirit
of
the
*NL*
besiegers
,
had
all
the
confidence
which
arises
from
perfect
discipline
*NL*
and
the
habitual
use
of
weapons
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
knight
employed
the
interval
in
causing
to
be
constructed
a
sort
of
*NL*
floating
bridge
,
or
long
raft
,
by
means
of
which
he
hoped
to
cross
the
*NL*
moat
in
despite
of
the
resistance
of
the
enemy
.
This
was
a
work
of
some
*NL*
time
,
which
the
leaders
the
less
regretted
,
as
it
gave
Ulrica
leisure
to
*NL*
execute
her
plan
of
diversion
in
their
favour
,
whatever
that
might
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
raft
was
completed
,
the
Black
Knight
addressed
the
*NL*
besiegers
:
--
``
It
avails
not
waiting
here
longer
,
my
friends
;
the
sun
is
*NL*
descending
to
the
west
--
and
I
have
that
upon
my
hands
which
will
not
*NL*
permit
me
to
tarry
with
you
another
day
.
Besides
,
it
will
be
a
marvel
if
*NL*
the
horsemen
come
not
upon
us
from
York
,
unless
we
speedily
accomplish
*NL*
our
purpose
.
Wherefore
,
one
of
ye
go
to
Locksley
,
and
bid
him
commence
a
*NL*
discharge
of
arrows
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
castle
,
and
move
forward
*NL*
as
if
about
to
assault
it
;
and
you
,
true
English
hearts
,
stand
by
me
,
*NL*
and
be
ready
to
thrust
the
raft
endlong
over
the
moat
whenever
the
*NL*
postern
on
our
side
is
thrown
open
.
Follow
me
boldly
across
,
and
aid
me
*NL*
to
burst
yon
sallyport
in
the
main
wall
of
the
castle
.
As
many
of
you
as
*NL*
like
not
this
service
,
or
are
but
ill
armed
to
meet
it
,
do
you
man
the
*NL*
top
of
the
outwork
,
draw
your
bow-strings
to
your
ears
,
and
mind
you
*NL*
quell
with
your
shot
whatever
shall
appear
to
man
the
rampart
--
Noble
*NL*
Cedric
,
wilt
thou
take
the
direction
of
those
which
remain
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
so
,
by
the
soul
of
Hereward
!
''
said
the
Saxon
;
``
lead
I
can
not
;
but
*NL*
may
posterity
curse
me
in
my
grave
,
if
I
follow
not
with
the
foremost
*NL*
wherever
thou
shalt
point
the
way
--
The
quarrel
is
mine
,
and
well
it
*NL*
becomes
me
to
be
in
the
van
of
the
battle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
,
bethink
thee
,
noble
Saxon
,
''
said
the
knight
,
``
thou
hast
neither
*NL*
hauberk
,
nor
corslet
,
nor
aught
but
that
light
helmet
,
target
,
and
*NL*
sword
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
better
!
''
answered
Cedric
;
``
I
shall
be
the
lighter
to
climb
these
*NL*
walls
.
And
,
--
forgive
the
boast
,
Sir
Knight
,
--
thou
shalt
this
day
see
*NL*
the
naked
breast
of
a
Saxon
as
boldly
presented
to
the
battle
as
ever
ye
*NL*
beheld
the
steel
corslet
of
a
Norman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
name
of
God
,
then
,
''
said
the
knight
,
``
fling
open
the
door
,
and
*NL*
launch
the
floating
bridge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
portal
,
which
led
from
the
inner-wall
of
the
barbican
to
the
moat
,
*NL*
and
which
corresponded
with
a
sallyport
in
the
main
wall
of
the
castle
,
*NL*
was
now
suddenly
opened
;
the
temporary
bridge
was
then
thrust
forward
,
*NL*
and
soon
flashed
in
the
waters
,
extending
its
length
between
the
castle
*NL*
and
outwork
,
and
forming
a
slippery
and
precarious
passage
for
two
men
*NL*
abreast
to
cross
the
moat
.
Well
aware
of
the
importance
of
taking
the
*NL*
foe
by
surprise
,
the
Black
Knight
,
closely
followed
by
Cedric
,
threw
*NL*
himself
upon
the
bridge
,
and
reached
the
opposite
side
.
Here
he
began
to
*NL*
thunder
with
his
axe
upon
the
gate
of
the
castle
,
protected
in
part
from
*NL*
the
shot
and
stones
cast
by
the
defenders
by
the
ruins
of
the
former
*NL*
drawbridge
,
which
the
Templar
had
demolished
in
his
retreat
from
the
*NL*
barbican
,
leaving
the
counterpoise
still
attached
to
the
upper
part
of
*NL*
the
portal
.
The
followers
of
the
knight
had
no
such
shelter
;
two
were
*NL*
instantly
shot
with
cross-bow
bolts
,
and
two
more
fell
into
the
moat
;
*NL*
the
others
retreated
back
into
the
barbican
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
situation
of
Cedric
and
of
the
Black
Knight
was
now
truly
dangerous
,
*NL*
and
would
have
been
still
more
so
,
but
for
the
constancy
of
the
*NL*
archers
in
the
barbican
,
who
ceased
not
to
shower
their
arrows
upon
*NL*
the
battlements
,
distracting
the
attention
of
those
by
whom
they
were
*NL*
manned
,
and
thus
affording
a
respite
to
their
two
chiefs
from
the
*NL*
storm
of
missiles
which
must
otherwise
have
overwhelmed
them
.
But
their
*NL*
situation
was
eminently
perilous
,
and
was
becoming
more
so
with
every
*NL*
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shame
on
ye
all
!
''
cried
De
Bracy
to
the
soldiers
around
him
;
``
do
ye
*NL*
call
yourselves
cross-bowmen
,
and
let
these
two
dogs
keep
their
station
*NL*
under
the
walls
of
the
castle
?
--
Heave
over
the
coping
stones
from
the
*NL*
battlements
,
an
better
may
not
be
--
Get
pick-axe
and
levers
,
and
down
*NL*
with
that
huge
pinnacle
!
''
pointing
to
a
heavy
piece
of
stone
carved-work
*NL*
that
projected
from
the
parapet
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
the
besiegers
caught
sight
of
the
red
flag
upon
the
angle
*NL*
of
the
tower
which
Ulrica
had
described
to
Cedric
.
The
stout
yeoman
*NL*
Locksley
was
the
first
who
was
aware
of
it
,
as
he
was
hasting
to
the
*NL*
outwork
,
impatient
to
see
the
progress
of
the
assault
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Saint
George
!
''
he
cried
,
``
Merry
Saint
George
for
England
!
--
To
the
*NL*
charge
,
bold
yeomen
!
--
why
leave
ye
the
good
knight
and
noble
Cedric
to
*NL*
storm
the
pass
alone
?
--
make
in
,
mad
priest
,
show
thou
canst
fight
for
*NL*
thy
rosary
,
--
make
in
,
brave
yeomen
!
--
the
castle
is
ours
,
we
have
friends
*NL*
within
--
See
yonder
flag
,
it
is
the
appointed
signal
--
Torquilstone
is
*NL*
ours
!
--
Think
of
honour
,
think
of
spoil
--
One
effort
,
and
the
place
is
*NL*
ours
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
that
he
bent
his
good
bow
,
and
sent
a
shaft
right
through
the
*NL*
breast
of
one
of
the
men-at-arms
,
who
,
under
De
Bracy
's
direction
,
was
*NL*
loosening
a
fragment
from
one
of
the
battlements
to
precipitate
on
the
*NL*
heads
of
Cedric
and
the
Black
Knight
.
A
second
soldier
caught
from
the
*NL*
hands
of
the
dying
man
the
iron
crow
,
with
which
he
heaved
at
and
*NL*
had
loosened
the
stone
pinnacle
,
when
,
receiving
an
arrow
through
his
*NL*
head-piece
,
he
dropped
from
the
battlements
into
the
moat
a
dead
man
.
*NL*
The
men-at-arms
were
daunted
,
for
no
armour
seemed
proof
against
the
*NL*
shot
of
this
tremendous
archer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
give
ground
,
base
knaves
!
''
said
De
Bracy
;
''
`
Mount
joye
Saint
*NL*
Dennis
!
'
--
Give
me
the
lever
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
snatching
it
up
,
he
again
assailed
the
loosened
pinnacle
,
which
was
*NL*
of
weight
enough
,
if
thrown
down
,
not
only
to
have
destroyed
the
remnant
*NL*
of
the
drawbridge
,
which
sheltered
the
two
foremost
assailants
,
but
also
*NL*
to
have
sunk
the
rude
float
of
planks
over
which
they
had
crossed
.
All
*NL*
saw
the
danger
,
and
the
boldest
,
even
the
stout
Friar
himself
,
avoided
*NL*
setting
foot
on
the
raft
.
Thrice
did
Locksley
bend
his
shaft
against
De
*NL*
Bracy
,
and
thrice
did
his
arrow
bound
back
from
the
knight
's
armour
of
*NL*
proof
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Curse
on
thy
Spanish
steel-coat
!
''
said
Locksley
,
``
had
English
smith
*NL*
forged
it
,
these
arrows
had
gone
through
,
an
as
if
it
had
been
silk
or
*NL*
sendal
.
''
He
then
began
to
call
out
,
``
Comrades
!
friends
!
noble
Cedric
!
*NL*
bear
back
,
and
let
the
ruin
fall
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
warning
voice
was
unheard
,
for
the
din
which
the
knight
himself
*NL*
occasioned
by
his
strokes
upon
the
postern
would
have
drowned
twenty
*NL*
war-trumpets
.
The
faithful
Gurth
indeed
sprung
forward
on
the
planked
*NL*
bridge
,
to
warn
Cedric
of
his
impending
fate
,
or
to
share
it
with
him
.
*NL*
But
his
warning
would
have
come
too
late
;
the
massive
pinnacle
already
*NL*
tottered
,
and
De
Bracy
,
who
still
heaved
at
his
task
,
would
have
*NL*
accomplished
it
,
had
not
the
voice
of
the
Templar
sounded
close
in
his
*NL*
ears
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
is
lost
,
De
Bracy
,
the
castle
burns
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
art
mad
to
say
so
!
''
replied
the
knight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
all
in
a
light
flame
on
the
western
side
.
I
have
striven
in
vain
*NL*
to
extinguish
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
stern
coolness
which
formed
the
basis
of
his
character
,
Brian
*NL*
de
Bois-Guilbert
communicated
this
hideous
intelligence
,
which
was
not
*NL*
so
calmly
received
by
his
astonished
comrade
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Saints
of
Paradise
!
''
said
De
Bracy
;
``
what
is
to
be
done
?
I
vow
to
Saint
*NL*
Nicholas
of
Limoges
a
candlestick
of
pure
gold

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Spare
thy
vow
,
''
said
the
Templar
,
``
and
mark
me
.
Lead
thy
men
down
,
as
*NL*
if
to
a
sally
;
throw
the
postern-gate
open

There
are
but
two
men
who
*NL*
occupy
the
float
,
fling
them
into
the
moat
,
and
push
across
for
the
*NL*
barbican
.
I
will
charge
from
the
main
gate
,
and
attack
the
barbican
on
*NL*
the
outside
;
and
if
we
can
regain
that
post
,
be
assured
we
shall
defend
*NL*
ourselves
until
we
are
relieved
,
or
at
least
till
they
grant
us
fair
*NL*
quarter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
well
thought
upon
,
''
said
De
Bracy
;
``
I
will
play
my
part
--
Templar

*NL*
thou
wilt
not
fail
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hand
and

I
will
not

said
Bois-Guilbert
.
``
But
haste
thee
,
in
*NL*
the
name
of
God

''
*NL*
*NL*
De
Bracy
hastily
drew
his
men
together
,
and
rushed
down
to
the
*NL*
postern-gate
,
which
he
caused
instantly
to
be
thrown
open
.
But
scarce
*NL*
was
this
done
ere
the
portentous
strength
of
the
Black
Knight
forced
his
*NL*
way
inward
in
despite
of
De
Bracy
and
his
followers
.
Two
of
the
foremost
*NL*
instantly
fell
,
and
the
rest
gave
way
notwithstanding
all
their
leader
's
*NL*
efforts
to
stop
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dogs
!
''
said
De
Bracy
,
``
will
ye

pass
for
*NL*
safety
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
the
devil
!
''
said
a
veteran
man-at-arms
,
bearing
back
from
the
*NL*
blows
of
their
sable
antagonist
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
if
he
be
the
devil
,
''
replied
De
Bracy
,
``
would
you
fly
from
him
into
*NL*
the
mouth
of
hell
?
--
the
castle
burns
behind
us
,
villains
!
--
let
despair
*NL*
give
you
courage
,
or
let
me
forward
!
I
will
cope
with
this
champion
*NL*
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
well
and
chivalrous
did
De
Bracy
that
day
maintain
the
fame
he
had
*NL*
acquired
in
the
civil
wars
of
that
dreadful
period
.
The
vaulted
passage
*NL*
to
which
the
postern
gave
entrance
,
and
in
which
these
two
redoubted
*NL*
champions
were
now
fighting
hand
to
hand
,
rung
with
the
furious
blows
*NL*
which
they
dealt
each
other
,
De
Bracy
with
his
sword
,
the
Black
Knight
*NL*
with
his
ponderous
axe
.
At
length
the
Norman
received
a
blow
,
which
,
*NL*
though
its
force
was
partly
parried
by
his
shield
,
for
otherwise
never
*NL*
more
would
De
Bracy
have
again
moved
limb
,
descended
yet
with
such
*NL*
violence
on
his
crest
,
that
he
measured
his
length
on
the
paved
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yield
thee
,
De
Bracy
,
''
said
the
Black
Champion
,
stooping
over
him
,
and
*NL*
holding
against
the
bars
of
his
helmet
the
fatal
poniard
with
which
the
*NL*
knights
dispatched
their
enemies
,
-LRB-
and
which
was
called
the
dagger
of
*NL*
mercy
,
-RRB-
--
``
yield
thee
,
Maurice
de
Bracy
,
rescue
or
no
rescue

or
thou
art
*NL*
but
a
dead
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not
yield
,
''
replied
De
Bracy
faintly
,
``
to
an
unknown
conqueror
.
*NL*
Tell
me
thy
name
,
or
work
thy
pleasure
on
me
--
it
shall
never
be
said
*NL*
that
Maurice
de
Bracy
was
prisoner
to
a
nameless
churl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Black
Knight
whispered
something
into
the
ear
of
the
vanquished
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
yield
me
to
be
true
prisoner
,
rescue
or
no
rescue
,
''
answered
the
*NL*
Norman
,
exchanging
his
tone
of
stern
and
determined
obstinacy
for
one
of
*NL*
deep
though
sullen
submission
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
to
the
barbican
,
''
said
the
victor
,
in
a
tone
of
authority
,
``
and
*NL*
there
wait
my
further
orders
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
first
,
let
me
say
,
''
said
De
Bracy
,
``
what
it
imports
thee
to
know
.
*NL*
Wilfred
of
Ivanhoe
is
wounded
and
a
prisoner

perish
in
the
*NL*
burning
castle
without
present
help
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wilfred
of
Ivanhoe
!
''
exclaimed
the
Black
Knight
--
``
prisoner
,
and
*NL*
perish
!
--
The
life
of
every
man
in
the
castle
shall
answer
it

*NL*
of

singed
--
Show
me
his
chamber
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ascend
yonder
winding
stair
,
''
said
De
Bracy
;
``
it
leads
to
his
*NL*
apartment
--
Wilt
thou
not
accept
my
guidance
?
''
he
added
,
in
a
submissive
*NL*
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
To
the
barbican
,
and
there
wait
my
orders
.
I
trust
thee
not
,
De
*NL*
Bracy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
During
this
combat
and
the
brief
conversation
which
ensued
,
Cedric
,
at
*NL*
the
head
of
a
body
of
men
,
among
whom
the
Friar
was
conspicuous
,
had
*NL*
pushed
across
the
bridge
as
soon
as
they
saw
the
postern
open
,
and
drove
*NL*
back
the
dispirited
and
despairing
followers
of
De
Bracy
,
of
whom
some
*NL*
asked
quarter
,
some
offered
vain
resistance
,
and
the
greater
part
fled
*NL*
towards
the
court-yard
.
De
Bracy
himself
arose
from
the
ground
,
and
cast
*NL*
a
sorrowful
glance
after
his
conqueror
.
``
He
trusts
me
not
!
''
he
repeated
;
*NL*
``
but
have
I
deserved
his
trust
?
''
He
then
lifted
his
sword
from
the
*NL*
floor
,
took
off
his
helmet
in
token
of
submission
,
and
,
going
to
the
*NL*
barbican
,
gave
up
his
sword
to
Locksley
,
whom
he
met
by
the
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
fire
augmented
,
symptoms
of
it
became
soon
apparent
in
the
*NL*
chamber
,
where
Ivanhoe
was
watched
and
tended
by
the
Jewess
Rebecca
.
He
*NL*
had
been
awakened
from
his
brief
slumber
by
the
noise
of
the
battle
;
and
*NL*
his
attendant
,
who
had
,
at
his
anxious
desire
,
again
placed
herself
at
*NL*
the
window
to
watch
and
report
to
him
the
fate
of
the
attack
,
was
*NL*
for
some
time
prevented
from
observing
either
,
by
the
increase
of
the
*NL*
smouldering
and
stifling
vapour
.
At
length
the
volumes
of
smoke
which
*NL*
rolled
into
the
apartment
--
the
cries
for
water
,
which
were
heard
even
*NL*
above
the
din
of
the
battle
made
them
sensible
of
the
progress
of
this
*NL*
new
danger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
castle
burns
,
''
said
Rebecca
;
``
it
burns
!
--
What
can
we
do
to
save
*NL*
ourselves
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fly
,
Rebecca
,
and
save
thine
own
life
,
''
said
Ivanhoe
,
``
for
no
human
aid
*NL*
can
avail
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not
fly
,
''
answered
Rebecca
;
``
we
will
be
saved
or
perish
*NL*
together
--
And
yet
,
great
God
!
--
my
father
,
my
father
--
what
will
be
his
*NL*
fate
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
the
door
of
the
apartment
flew
open
,
and
the
Templar
*NL*
presented
himself
,
--
a
ghastly
figure
,
for
his
gilded
armour
was
broken
*NL*
and
bloody
,
and
the
plume
was
partly
shorn
away
,
partly
burnt
from
his
*NL*
casque
.
``
I
have
found
thee
,
''
said
he
to
Rebecca
;
``
thou
shalt
prove
I
*NL*
will
keep
my
word
to
share
weal
and
woe
with
thee
--
There
is
but
one
*NL*
path
to
safety
,
I
have
cut
my
way
through
fifty
dangers
to
point
it
to
*NL*
thee
--
up
,
and
instantly
follow
me
!
''
-LSB-
38
-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alone
,
''
answered
Rebecca
,
``
I
will
not
follow
thee
.
If
thou
wert
born
of
*NL*
woman
--
if
thou
hast
but
a
touch
of
human
charity
in
thee
--
if
thy
heart
*NL*
be
not
hard
as
thy
breastplate
--
save
my
aged
father
--
save
this
wounded
*NL*
knight
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
knight
,
''
answered
the
Templar
,
with
his
characteristic
calmness
,
``
a
*NL*
knight
,
Rebecca
,
must
encounter
his
fate
,
whether
it
meet
him
in
the
*NL*
shape
of
sword
or
flame
--
and
who
recks
how
or
where
a
Jew
meets
with
*NL*
his
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Savage
warrior
,
''
said
Rebecca
,
``
rather
will
I
perish
in
the
flames
than
*NL*
accept
safety
from
thee
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
shalt
not
choose
,
Rebecca
--
once
didst
thou
foil
me
,
but
never
*NL*
mortal
did
so
twice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
he
seized
on
the
terrified
maiden
,
who
filled
the
air
with
*NL*
her
shrieks
,
and
bore
her
out
of
the
room
in
his
arms
in
spite
of
her
*NL*
cries
,
and
without
regarding
the
menaces
and
defiance
which
Ivanhoe
*NL*
thundered
against
him
.
``
Hound
of
the
Temple
--
stain
to
thine
Order
--
set
*NL*
free
the
damsel
!
Traitor
of
Bois-Guilbert
,
it
is
Ivanhoe

*NL*
thee
!
--
Villain
,
I
will
have
thy
heart
's
blood
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
not
found
thee
,
Wilfred
,
''
said
the
Black
Knight
,
who
at
that
*NL*
instant
entered
the
apartment
,
``
but
for
thy
shouts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
thou
be
`
st
true
knight
,
''
said
Wilfred
,
``
think
not
of
me
--
pursue
yon
*NL*
ravisher
--
save
the
Lady
Rowena
--
look
to
the
noble
Cedric
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
their
turn
,
''
answered
he
of
the
Fetterlock
,
``
but
thine
is
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
seizing
upon
Ivanhoe
,
he
bore
him
off
with
as
much
ease
as
the
*NL*
Templar
had
carried
off
Rebecca
,
rushed
with
him
to
the
postern
,
and
*NL*
having
there
delivered
his
burden
to
the
care
of
two
yeomen
,
he
again
*NL*
entered
the
castle
to
assist
in
the
rescue
of
the
other
prisoners
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
turret
was
now
in
bright
flames
,
which
flashed
out
furiously
from
*NL*
window
and
shot-hole
.
But
in
other
parts
,
the
great
thickness
of
the
*NL*
walls
and
the
vaulted
roofs
of
the
apartments
,
resisted
the
progress
*NL*
of
the
flames
,
and
there
the
rage
of
man
still
triumphed
,
as
the
scarce
*NL*
more
dreadful
element
held
mastery
elsewhere
;
for
the
besiegers
pursued
*NL*
the
defenders
of
the
castle
from
chamber
to
chamber
,
and
satiated
in
*NL*
their
blood
the
vengeance
which
had
long
animated
them
against
the
*NL*
soldiers
of
the
tyrant
Front-de-Boeuf
.
Most
of
the
garrison
resisted
to
*NL*
the
uttermost
--
few
of
them
asked
quarter
--
none
received
it
.
The
air
was
*NL*
filled
with
groans
and
clashing
of
arms
--
the
floors
were
slippery
with
*NL*
the
blood
of
despairing
and
expiring
wretches
.
*NL*
*NL*
Through
this
scene
of
confusion
,
Cedric
rushed
in
quest
of
Rowena
,
while
*NL*
the
faithful
Gurth
,
following
him
closely
through
the
``
melee
''
,
neglected
*NL*
his
own
safety
while
he
strove
to
avert
the
blows
that
were
aimed
at
*NL*
his
master
.
The
noble
Saxon
was
so
fortunate
as
to
reach
his
ward
's
*NL*
apartment
just
as
she
had
abandoned
all
hope
of
safety
,
and
,
with
a
*NL*
crucifix
clasped
in
agony
to
her
bosom
,
sat
in
expectation
of
instant
*NL*
death
.
He
committed
her
to
the
charge
of
Gurth
,
to
be
conducted
in
*NL*
safety
to
the
barbican
,
the
road
to
which
was
now
cleared
of
the
enemy
,
*NL*
and
not
yet
interrupted
by
the
flames
.
This
accomplished
,
the
loyal
*NL*
Cedric
hastened
in
quest
of
his
friend
Athelstane
,
determined
,
at
every
*NL*
risk
to
himself
,
to
save
that
last
scion
of
Saxon
royalty
.
But
ere
*NL*
Cedric
penetrated
as
far
as
the
old
hall
in
which
he
had
himself
been
*NL*
a
prisoner
,
the
inventive
genius
of
Wamba
had
procured
liberation
for
*NL*
himself
and
his
companion
in
adversity
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
noise
of
the
conflict
announced
that
it
was
at
the
hottest
,
the
*NL*
Jester
began
to
shout
,
with
the
utmost
power
of
his
lungs
,
``
Saint
George
*NL*
and
the
dragon
!
--
Bonny
Saint
George
for
merry
England
!
--
The
castle
is
*NL*
won
!
''
And
these
sounds
he
rendered
yet
more
fearful
,
by
banging
against
*NL*
each
other
two
or
three
pieces
of
rusty
armour
which
lay
scattered
*NL*
around
the
hall
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
guard
,
which
had
been
stationed
in
the
outer
,
or
anteroom
,
and
*NL*
whose
spirits
were
already
in
a
state
of
alarm
,
took
fright
at
Wamba
's
*NL*
clamour
,
and
,
leaving
the
door
open
behind
them
,
ran
to
tell
the
Templar
*NL*
that
foemen
had
entered
the
old
hall
.
Meantime
the
prisoners
found
no
*NL*
difficulty
in
making
their
escape
into
the
anteroom
,
and
from
thence
*NL*
into
the
court
of
the
castle
,
which
was
now
the
last
scene
of
contest
.
*NL*
Here
sat
the
fierce
Templar
,
mounted
on
horseback
,
surrounded
by
several
*NL*
of
the
garrison
both
on
horse
and
foot
,
who
had
united
their
strength
*NL*
to
that
of
this
renowned
leader
,
in
order
to
secure
the
last
chance
*NL*
of
safety
and
retreat
which
remained
to
them
.
The
drawbridge
had
been
*NL*
lowered
by
his
orders
,
but
the
passage
was
beset
;
for
the
archers
,
who
*NL*
had
hitherto
only
annoyed
the
castle
on
that
side
by
their
missiles
,
no
*NL*
sooner
saw
the
flames
breaking
out
,
and
the
bridge
lowered
,
than
they
*NL*
thronged
to
the
entrance
,
as
well
to
prevent
the
escape
of
the
garrison
,
*NL*
as
to
secure
their
own
share
of
booty
ere
the
castle
should
be
burnt
*NL*
down
.
On
the
other
hand
,
a
party
of
the
besiegers
who
had
entered
by
*NL*
the
postern
were
now
issuing
out
into
the
court-yard
,
and
attacking
with
*NL*
fury
the
remnant
of
the
defenders
who
were
thus
assaulted
on
both
sides
*NL*
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
Animated
,
however
,
by
despair
,
and
supported
by
the
example
of
their
*NL*
indomitable
leader
,
the
remaining
soldiers
of
the
castle
fought
with
*NL*
the
utmost
valour
;
and
,
being
well-armed
,
succeeded
more
than
once
in
*NL*
driving
back
the
assailants
,
though
much
inferior
in
numbers
.
Rebecca
,
*NL*
placed
on
horseback
before
one
of
the
Templar
's
Saracen
slaves
,
was
in
*NL*
the
midst
of
the
little
party
;
and
Bois-Guilbert
,
notwithstanding
the
*NL*
confusion
of
the
bloody
fray
,
showed
every
attention
to
her
safety
.
*NL*
Repeatedly
he
was
by
her
side
,
and
,
neglecting
his
own
defence
,
held
*NL*
before
her
the
fence
of
his
triangular
steel-plated
shield
;
and
anon
*NL*
starting
from
his
position
by
her
,
he
cried
his
war-cry
,
dashed
forward
,
*NL*
struck
to
earth
the
most
forward
of
the
assailants
,
and
was
on
the
same
*NL*
instant
once
more
at
her
bridle
rein
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athelstane
,
who
,
as
the
reader
knows
,
was
slothful
,
but
not
cowardly
,
*NL*
beheld
the
female
form
whom
the
Templar
protected
thus
sedulously
,
and
*NL*
doubted
not
that
it
was
Rowena
whom
the
knight
was
carrying
off
,
in
*NL*
despite
of
all
resistance
which
could
be
offered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
soul
of
Saint
Edward
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
will
rescue
her
from
yonder
*NL*
over-proud
knight
,
and
he
shall
die
by
my
hand
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Think
what
you
do
!
''
cried
Wamba
;
``
hasty
hand

for

*NL*
my
bauble

ye
may

but
*NL*
I
will

no
bones
of
mine
shall
be
broken
unless
I
know
*NL*
for
whom
.
--
And
you
without
armour
too
!

Bethink
you
,
silk
bonnet
never
*NL*
kept
out

blade

Nay
,
then
,
if
wilful
will
to
water
,
wilful
must
*NL*
drench
.
--
`
Deus
vobiscum
'
,
most
doughty
Athelstane
!
''
--
he
concluded
,
*NL*
loosening
the
hold
which
he
had
hitherto
kept
upon
the
Saxon
's
tunic
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
snatch
a
mace
from
the
pavement
,
on
which
it
lay
beside
one
whose
*NL*
dying
grasp
had
just
relinquished
it
--
to
rush
on
the
Templar
's
band
,
and
*NL*
to
strike
in
quick
succession
to
the
right
and
left
,
levelling
a
warrior
*NL*
at
each
blow
,
was
,
for
Athelstane
's
great
strength
,
now
animated
with
*NL*
unusual
fury
,
but
the
work
of
a
single
moment
;
he
was
soon
within
two
*NL*
yards
of
Bois-Guilbert
,
whom
he
defied
in
his
loudest
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Turn
,
false-hearted
Templar
!
let
go
her
whom
thou
art
unworthy
to
*NL*
touch
--
turn
,
limb
of
a
hand
of
murdering
and
hypocritical
robbers
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dog
!
''
said
the
Templar
,
grinding
his
teeth
,
``
I
will
teach
thee
to
*NL*
blaspheme
the
holy
Order
of
the
Temple
of
Zion
;
''
and
with
these
words
,
*NL*
half-wheeling
his
steed
,
he
made
a
demi-courbette
towards
the
Saxon
,
and
*NL*
rising
in
the
stirrups
,
so
as
to
take
full
advantage
of
the
descent
of
*NL*
the
horse
,
he
discharged
a
fearful
blow
upon
the
head
of
Athelstane
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
said
Wamba
,
that
silken
bonnet
keeps
out
no
steel
blade
.
So
*NL*
trenchant
was
the
Templar
's
weapon
,
that
it
shore
asunder
,
as
it
had
*NL*
been
a
willow
twig
,
the
tough
and
plaited
handle
of
the
mace
,
which
the
*NL*
ill-fated
Saxon
reared
to
parry
the
blow
,
and
,
descending
on
his
head
,
*NL*
levelled
him
with
the
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Ha
!
Beau-seant
!
'
''
exclaimed
Bois-Guilbert
,
``
thus
be
it
to
the
*NL*
maligners
of
the
Temple-knights
!
''
Taking
advantage
of
the
dismay
which
*NL*
was
spread
by
the
fall
of
Athelstane
,
and
calling
aloud
,
``
Those
who
*NL*
would
save
themselves
,
follow
me
!
''
he
pushed
across
the
drawbridge
,
*NL*
dispersing
the
archers
who
would
have
intercepted
them
.
He
was
followed
*NL*
by
his
Saracens
,
and
some
five
or
six
men-at-arms
,
who
had
mounted
their
*NL*
horses
.
The
Templar
's
retreat
was
rendered
perilous
by
the
numbers
of
*NL*
arrows
shot
off
at
him
and
his
party
;
but
this
did
not
prevent
him
from
*NL*
galloping
round
to
the
barbican
,
of
which
,
according
to
his
previous
*NL*
plan
,
he
supposed
it
possible
De
Bracy
might
have
been
in
possession
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
De
Bracy
!
De
Bracy
!
''
he
shouted
,
``
art
thou
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
here
,
''
replied
De
Bracy
,
``
but
I
am
a
prisoner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
I
rescue
thee
?
''
cried
Bois-Guilbert
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
replied
De
Bracy
;
``
I
have
rendered
me
,
rescue
or
no
rescue
.
I
will
*NL*
be
true
prisoner
.
Save
thyself
--
there
are
hawks
abroad
--
put
the
seas
*NL*
betwixt
you
and
England
--
I
dare
not
say
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
answered
the
Templar
,
``
an
thou
wilt
tarry
there
,
remember
I
*NL*
have
redeemed
word
and
glove
.
Be
the
hawks
where
they
will
,
methinks
*NL*
the
walls
of
the
Preceptory
of
Templestowe
will
be
cover
sufficient
,
and
*NL*
thither
will
I
,
like
heron
to
her
haunt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Having
thus
spoken
,
he
galloped
off
with
his
followers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Those
of
the
castle
who
had
not
gotten
to
horse
,
still
continued
*NL*
to
fight
desperately
with
the
besiegers
,
after
the
departure
of
the
*NL*
Templar
,
but
rather
in
despair
of
quarter
than
that
they
entertained
any
*NL*
hope
of
escape
.
The
fire
was
spreading
rapidly
through
all
parts
of
the
*NL*
castle
,
when
Ulrica
,
who
had
first
kindled
it
,
appeared
on
a
turret
,
in
*NL*
the
guise
of
one
of
the
ancient
furies
,
yelling
forth
a
war-song
,
such
*NL*
as
was
of
yore
raised
on
the
field
of
battle
by
the
scalds
of
the
*NL*
yet
heathen
Saxons
.
Her
long
dishevelled
grey
hair
flew
back
from
her
*NL*
uncovered
head
;
the
inebriating
delight
of
gratified
vengeance
contended
*NL*
in
her
eyes
with
the
fire
of
insanity
;
and
she
brandished
the
distaff
*NL*
which
she
held
in
her
hand
,
as
if
she
had
been
one
of
the
Fatal
Sisters
,
*NL*
who
spin
and
abridge
the
thread
of
human
life
.
Tradition
has
preserved
*NL*
some
wild
strophes
of
the
barbarous
hymn
which
she
chanted
wildly
amid
*NL*
that
scene
of
fire
and
of
slaughter
:

The
towering
flames
had
now
surmounted
every
obstruction
,
and
rose
to
*NL*
the
evening
skies
one
huge
and
burning
beacon
,
seen
far
and
wide
through
*NL*
the
adjacent
country
.
Tower
after
tower
crashed
down
,
with
blazing
roof
*NL*
and
rafter
;
and
the
combatants
were
driven
from
the
court-yard
.
The
*NL*
vanquished
,
of
whom
very
few
remained
,
scattered
and
escaped
into
the
*NL*
neighbouring
wood
.
The
victors
,
assembling
in
large
bands
,
gazed
with
*NL*
wonder
,
not
unmixed
with
fear
,
upon
the
flames
,
in
which
their
own
ranks
*NL*
and
arms
glanced
dusky
red
.
The
maniac
figure
of
the
Saxon
Ulrica
was
*NL*
for
a
long
time
visible
on
the
lofty
stand
she
had
chosen
,
tossing
*NL*
her
arms
abroad
with
wild
exultation
,
as
if
she
reined
empress
of
the
*NL*
conflagration
which
she
had
raised
.
At
length
,
with
a
terrific
crash
,
*NL*
the
whole
turret
gave
way
,
and
she
perished
in
the
flames
which
had
*NL*
consumed
her
tyrant
.
An
awful
pause
of
horror
silenced
each
murmur
of
*NL*
the
armed
spectators
,
who
,
for
the
space
of
several
minutes
,
stirred
not
*NL*
a
finger
,
save
to
sign
the
cross
.
The
voice
of
Locksley
was
then
heard
,
*NL*
``
Shout
,
yeomen
!
--
the
den
of
tyrants
is
no

Let
each
bring
his

spoil
to
our
chosen
place
of
rendezvous
at
the
Trysting-tree
in
the
*NL*
Harthill-walk
;
for
there
at
break
of

will
we
make
just
partition

CHAPTER

*NL*
*NL*
Trust
me
each
state
must
have
its
policies
:
*NL*
Kingdoms
have
edicts
,
cities
have
their
charters
;
*NL*
Even
the
wild
outlaw
,
in
his
forest-walk
,
*NL*
Keeps
yet
some
touch
of
civil
discipline
;

For
not

Adam
wore
his
verdant
apron
,
*NL*
Hath
man
with

in

union
dwelt

But

to
draw
that
union
closer

Old
Play
*NL*
*NL*
The
daylight
had
dawned
upon
the
glades
of
the
oak
forest
.
The
green
*NL*
boughs
glittered
with
all
their
pearls
of
dew
.
The
hind
led
her
fawn
*NL*
from
the
covert
of
high
fern
to
the
more
open
walks
of
the
greenwood
,
*NL*
and
no
huntsman
was
there
to
watch
or
intercept
the
stately
hart
,
as
he
*NL*
paced
at
the
head
of
the
antler
'd
herd
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
outlaws
were
all
assembled
around
the
Trysting-tree
in
the
*NL*
Harthill-walk
,
where
they
had
spent
the
night
in
refreshing
themselves
*NL*
after
the
fatigues
of
the
siege
,
some
with
wine
,
some
with
slumber
,
many
*NL*
with
hearing
and
recounting
the
events
of
the
day
,
and
computing
the
*NL*
heaps
of
plunder
which
their
success
had
placed
at
the
disposal
of
their
*NL*
Chief
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
spoils
were
indeed
very
large
;
for
,
notwithstanding
that
much
was
*NL*
consumed
,
a
great
deal
of
plate
,
rich
armour
,
and
splendid
clothing
,
*NL*
had
been
secured
by
the
exertions
of
the
dauntless
outlaws
,
who
could
be
*NL*
appalled
by
no
danger
when
such
rewards
were
in
view
.
Yet
so
strict
were
*NL*
the
laws
of
their
society
,
that
no
one
ventured
to
appropriate
any
*NL*
part
of
the
booty
,
which
was
brought
into
one
common
mass
,
to
be
at
the
*NL*
disposal
of
their
leader
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
place
of
rendezvous
was
an
aged
oak
;
not
however
the
same
to
which
*NL*
Locksley
had
conducted
Gurth
and
Wamba
in
the
earlier
part
of
the
story
,
*NL*
but
one
which
was
the
centre
of
a
silvan
amphitheatre
,
within
half
a
*NL*
mile
of
the
demolished
castle
of
Torquilstone
.
Here
Locksley
assumed
his
*NL*
seat
--
a
throne
of
turf
erected
under
the
twisted
branches
of
the
huge
*NL*
oak
,
and
the
silvan
followers
were
gathered
around
him
.
He
assigned
to
*NL*
the
Black
Knight
a
seat
at
his
right
hand
,
and
to
Cedric
a
place
upon
*NL*
his
left
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
my
freedom
,
noble
sirs
,
''
he
said
,
``
but
in
these
glades
I
am

monarch

they
are
my
kingdom

these
my

reck

seen

said
the

chief
,

The
numbers
who
hastened
to
execute
this
duty
,
considering
that
an
*NL*
interesting
division
of
spoil
was
about
to
take
place
,
showed
how
much
*NL*
the
troop
had
at
heart
the
safety
of
their
spiritual
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Meanwhile

proceed

said
Locksley
;
``

turning
to
the

choice
of
that
which
best
suits
thee
,
to
recompense
thy
people
*NL*
who
were
partakers
with
us
in
this
adventure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
yeoman
,
''
said
Cedric
,
``
my
heart
is
oppressed
with
sadness
.
The
*NL*
noble
Athelstane
of
Coningsburgh
is
no
more
--
the
last
sprout
of
*NL*
the
sainted
Confessor
!
Hopes
have
perished
with
him
which
can
never
*NL*
return
!
--
A
sparkle
hath
been
quenched
by
his
blood
,
which
no
human
*NL*
breath
can
again
rekindle
!
My
people
,
save
the
few
who
are
now
with
me
,
*NL*
do
but
tarry
my
presence
to
transport
his
honoured
remains
to
their
last
*NL*
mansion
.
The
Lady
Rowena
is
desirous
to
return
to
Rotherwood
,
and
must
*NL*
be
escorted
by
a
sufficient
force
.
I
should
,
therefore
,
ere
now
,
have
*NL*
left
this
place
;
and
I
waited
--
not
to
share
the
booty
,
for
,
so
help
me
*NL*
God
and
Saint
Withold
!
as
neither
I
nor
any
of
mine
will
touch
the
value
*NL*
of
a
liard
,
--
I
waited
but
to
render
my
thanks
to
thee
and
to
thy
bold
*NL*
yeomen
,
for
the
life
and
honour
ye
have
saved
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
but
,
''
said
the
chief
Outlaw
,
``
we
did
but
half
the
work
at
*NL*
most
--
take
of
the
spoil
what
may
reward
your
own
neighbours
and
*NL*
followers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
rich
enough
to
reward
them
from
mine
own
wealth
,

answered
Cedric
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
some
,
''
said
Wamba
,
``
have
been
wise
enough
to
reward
themselves
;
*NL*
they
do
not
march
off
empty-handed
altogether
.
We
do
not
all
wear
*NL*
motley
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
welcome

''
said
Locksley
;
``
our
laws
bind
none
but
ourselves

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
thou
,
my
poor
knave
,
''
said
Cedric
,
turning
about
and
embracing
*NL*
his
Jester
,
``
how
shall
I
reward
thee
,
who
feared
not
to
give
thy
body
*NL*
to
chains
and
death
instead

!
--
All
forsook
me
,
when
the
poor
fool
*NL*
was
faithful
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
tear
stood
in
the
eye
of
the
rough
Thane
as
he
spoke
--
a
mark
of
*NL*
feeling
which
even
the
death
of
Athelstane
had
not
extracted
;
but
there
*NL*
was
something
in
the
half-instinctive
attachment
of
his
clown
,
that
*NL*
waked
his
nature
more
keenly
than
even
grief
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
''
said
the
Jester
,
extricating
himself
from
master
's
caress
,
``
if
*NL*
you
pay
my
service
with
the
water
of
your
eye
,
the
Jester
must
weep
*NL*
for
company
,
and
then
what
becomes
of
his
vocation
?
--
But
,
uncle
,
if
you
*NL*
would
indeed
pleasure
me
,
I
pray
you
to
pardon
my
playfellow
Gurth
,
who
*NL*
stole
a
week
from
your
service
to
bestow
it
on
your
son

*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
him
!
''
exclaimed
Cedric
;
``
I
will
both
pardon
and
reward
*NL*
him

Kneel
down
,
Gurth

The
swineherd
was
in
an
instant
at
his
*NL*
master
's
feet
--
``
THEOW

ESNE
-LSB-

said
Cedric
*NL*
touching
him
with
a
wand
;

*NL*
*NL*
No
longer
a
serf
,
but
a
freeman
and
a
landholder
,
Gurth
sprung
upon
his
*NL*
feet
,
and
twice
bounded
aloft
to
almost
his
own
height
from
the
ground
.
*NL*
``
A
smith
and
a

he
cried
,

he
continued
,
--
for
*NL*
that
faithful
cur
,
seeing
his
master
thus
transported
,
began
to
jump
*NL*
upon
him
,
to
express
his
sympathy
,
--
``
knowest
thou
thy
master
still
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay

''
said
Wamba
,
``
Fangs
and
I
still
know

Gurth

must
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
forget

said

Gurth
;

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay

said
Wamba
,

serf
*NL*
sits
by
the
hall-fire
when

freeman
must
forth
to
the
field
of
*NL*
battle
--
And
what
saith
Oldhelm
of
Malmsbury
--
Better
a
fool
at
a
feast
*NL*
than
a
wise
man
at
a
fray

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
tramp
of
horses
was
now
heard
,
and
the
Lady
Rowena
appeared
,
*NL*
surrounded
by
several
riders
,
and
a
much
stronger
party
of
footmen
,
who
*NL*
joyfully
shook
their
pikes
and
clashed
their
brown-bills
for
joy
of
her
*NL*
freedom
.
She
herself
,
richly
attired
,
and
mounted
on
a
dark
chestnut
*NL*
palfrey
,
had
recovered
all
the
dignity
of
her
manner
,
and
only
an
*NL*
unwonted
degree
of
paleness
showed
the
sufferings
she
had
undergone
.
Her
*NL*
lovely
brow
,
though
sorrowful
,
bore
on
it
a
cast
of
reviving
hope
*NL*
for
the
future
,
as
well
as
of
grateful
thankfulness
for
the
past
*NL*
deliverance
--
She
knew
that
Ivanhoe
was
safe
,
and
she
knew
that
*NL*
Athelstane
was
dead
.
The
former
assurance
filled
her
with
the
most
*NL*
sincere
delight
;
and
if
she
did
not
absolutely
rejoice
at
the
latter
,
*NL*
she
might
be
pardoned
for
feeling
the
full
advantage
of
being
freed
*NL*
from
further
persecution
on
the
only
subject
in
which
she
had
ever
been
*NL*
contradicted
by
her
guardian
Cedric
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Rowena
bent
her
steed
towards
Locksley
's
seat
,
that
bold
yeoman
,
with
*NL*
all
his
followers
,
rose
to
receive
her
,
as
if
by
a
general
instinct
of
*NL*
courtesy
.
The
blood
rose
to
her
cheeks
,
as
,
courteously
waving
her
hand
,
*NL*
and
bending
so
low
that
her
beautiful
and
loose
tresses
were
for
an
*NL*
instant
mixed
with
the
flowing
mane
of
her
palfrey
,
she
expressed
in
*NL*
few
but
apt
words
her
obligations
and
her
gratitude
to
Locksley
and
her
*NL*
other
deliverers
.
--
``
God
bless
you
,
brave
men
,
''
she
concluded
,
``
God
and
*NL*
Our
Lady
bless
you
and
requite
you
for
gallantly
perilling
yourselves

in

the
oppressed
!
--
If
any
of
you
should
hunger
,
remember
*NL*
Rowena
has
food
--
if
you
should
thirst
,
she
has
many
a
butt
of
wine
and
*NL*
brown
ale
--
and
if
the
Normans
drive
ye
from
these
walks
,
Rowena
has
*NL*
forests
of
her
own
,
where
her
gallant
deliverers
may
range
at
full
*NL*
freedom
,
and
never

ask
whose
arrow
hath
struck
down
the
deer

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks

gentle
lady

said
Locksley
;
``
thanks
from
my
company
and
*NL*
myself

But
,
to
have
saved
you
requites
itself
.
We
who

the
*NL*
greenwood
do
many
a
wild
deed
,
and
the
Lady
Rowena
's
deliverance
may
be
*NL*
received
as
an
atonement

''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
bowing
from
her
palfrey
,
Rowena
turned
to
depart
;
but
pausing
a
*NL*
moment
,
while
Cedric
,
who
was
to
attend
her
,
was
also
taking
his
leave
,
*NL*
she
found
herself
unexpectedly
close
by
the
prisoner
De
Bracy
.
He
stood
*NL*
under
a
tree
in
deep
meditation
,
his
arms
crossed
upon
his
breast
,
*NL*
and
Rowena
was
in
hopes
she
might
pass
him
unobserved
.
He
looked
up
,
*NL*
however
,
and
,
when
aware
of
her
presence
,
a
deep
flush
of
shame
suffused
*NL*
his
handsome
countenance
.
He
stood
a
moment
most
irresolute
;
then
,
*NL*
stepping
forward
,
took
her
palfrey
by
the
rein
,
and
bent
his
knee
before
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
the
Lady
Rowena
deign
to
cast
an
eye

on
a
captive
knight
--
on
a
*NL*
dishonoured
soldier
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
Knight

''
answered
Rowena
,
``
in
enterprises
such
as
yours
,
the
real
*NL*
dishonour
lies
not
in
failure
,
but
in
success

*NL*
*NL*
``
Conquest

,

soften
the

answered
De
Bracy
;
``
let
me
*NL*
but
know
that
the
Lady
Rowena
forgives
the
violence
occasioned
by
an
*NL*
ill-fated
passion

and
she
shall
soon
learn
that
De
Bracy
knows
how
to
*NL*
serve
her
in
nobler
ways
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
forgive
you
,
Sir
Knight
,
''
said
Rowena
,
``
as
a
Christian
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
means
,

said
Wamba
,
``
that
she
does
not
forgive
him
at
all

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
can
never
forgive
the
misery

desolation
your
madness
has

occasioned

continued
Rowena
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Unloose
your
hold
on
the
lady

rein

said
Cedric
,
coming
up
.
``
By
the
*NL*
bright
sun
above
us

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
threatens
safely

said
De
Bracy
;
``
but
when
*NL*
had
a
Saxon
any
touch
of
courtesy

*NL*
*NL*
Then
retiring
two
steps
backward
,
he
permitted
the
lady
to
move
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cedric
,
ere
they
departed
,
expressed
his
peculiar
gratitude
to
the
Black
*NL*
Champion
,
and
earnestly
entreated
him
to
accompany
him
to
Rotherwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know

he
said
,
``
that
ye
errant
knights
desire

carry
your
fortunes

of

war
is
*NL*
a
changeful
mistress

a
home
is
sometimes
desirable
even
to
the

champion

trade
is
wandering

Thou

*NL*
*NL*
``
It

Cedric

striking
his
ready

*NL*
into
the
gauntleted
palm
of
the
Black
Knight
,

``
it

*NL*
``
I
have

to

added
the
Saxon

``
that

chains

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay

Wamba

who
had
resumed
his
attendance
on
his
master

*NL*
``

continued
the
Jester

lifting
up

his

gravely

*NL*
*NL*
``
Peace

said
Cedric
,
his
anger
at
this
untimely
jest
being
*NL*
checked
by
the
recollection
of
Wamba
's
recent
services
.
Rowena
waved
a
*NL*
graceful
adieu
to
him
of
the
Fetterlock
--
the
Saxon
bade
God
speed
him
,
*NL*
and
on
they
moved
through
a
wide
glade
of
the
forest
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
scarce
departed
,
ere
a
sudden
procession
moved
from
under
the
*NL*
greenwood
branches
,
swept
slowly
round
the
silvan
amphitheatre
,
and
*NL*
took
the
same
direction
with
Rowena
and
her
followers
.
The
priests
of
*NL*
a
neighbouring
convent
,
in
expectation
of
the
ample
donation
,
or
*NL*
``
soul-scat
''
,
which
Cedric
had
propined
,
attended
upon
the
car
in
which
*NL*
the
body
of
Athelstane
was
laid
,
and
sang
hymns
as
it
was
sadly
*NL*
and
slowly
borne
on
the
shoulders
of
his
vassals
to
his
castle
of
*NL*
Coningsburgh
,
to
be
there
deposited
in
the
grave
of
Hengist
,
from
whom
*NL*
the
deceased
derived
his
long
descent
.
Many
of
his
vassals
had
assembled
*NL*
at
the
news
of
his
death
,
and
followed
the
bier
with
all
the
external
*NL*
marks
,
at
least
,
of
dejection
and
sorrow
.
Again
the
outlaws
arose
,
and
*NL*
paid
the
same
rude
and
spontaneous
homage
to
death
,
which
they
had
*NL*
so
lately
rendered
to
beauty
--
the
slow
chant
and
mournful
step
of
the
*NL*
priests
brought
back
to
their
remembrance
such
of
their
comrades
as
had
*NL*
fallen
in
the
yesterday
's
array
.
But
such
recollections
dwell
not
long
*NL*
with
those
who
lead
a
life
of
danger
and
enterprise
,
and
ere
the
sound
*NL*
of
the
death-hymn
had
died
on
the
wind
,
the
outlaws
were
again
busied
in
*NL*
the
distribution
of
their
spoil
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Valiant
knight
,
''
said
Locksley
to
the
Black
Champion
,
``
without
whose
*NL*
good
heart
and
mighty
arm
our
enterprise
must
altogether
have
failed
,
*NL*
will
it
please
you
to
take
from
that
mass
of
spoil
whatever
may
best
*NL*
serve
to
pleasure
you
,
and
to
remind
you
of
this
my
Trysting-tree
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
accept
the
offer
,
''
said
the
Knight
,
``
as
frankly
as
it
is
given
;
and
I
*NL*
ask
permission
to
dispose
of
Sir
Maurice
de
Bracy
at
my
own
pleasure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
thine
already
,
''
said
Locksley
,
``
and
well
for
him
!
else
the
*NL*
tyrant
had
graced
the
highest
bough
of
this
oak
,
with
as
many
of
his
*NL*
Free-Companions
as
we
could
gather
,
hanging
thick
as
acorns
around
*NL*
him
.
--
But
he
is
thy
prisoner
,
and
he
is
safe
,
though
he
had
slain
my
*NL*
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
De
Bracy
,
''
said
the
Knight
,
``
thou
art
free
--
depart
.
He
whose
prisoner
*NL*
thou
art
scorns
to
take
mean
revenge
for
what
is
past
.
But
beware
of
*NL*
the
future
,
lest
a
worse
thing
befall
thee
.
--
Maurice
de
Bracy
,
I
say
*NL*
BEWARE
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
De
Bracy
bowed
low
and
in
silence
,
and
was
about
to
withdraw
,
when
the
*NL*
yeomen
burst
at
once
into
a
shout
of
execration
and
derision
.
The
proud
*NL*
knight
instantly
stopped
,
turned
back
,
folded
his
arms
,
drew
up
his
form
*NL*
to
its
full
height
,
and
exclaimed
,
``
Peace
,
ye
yelping
curs
!
who
open
*NL*
upon
a
cry
which
ye
followed
not
when
the
stag
was
at
bay
--
De
Bracy
*NL*
scorns
your
censure
as
he
would
disdain
your
applause
.
To
your
brakes
*NL*
and
caves
,
ye
outlawed
thieves
!
and
be
silent
when
aught
knightly
or
*NL*
noble
is
but
spoken
within
a
league
of
your
fox-earths
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
ill-timed
defiance
might
have
procured
for
De
Bracy
a
volley
of
*NL*
arrows
,
but
for
the
hasty
and
imperative
interference
of
the
outlaw
*NL*
Chief
.
Meanwhile
the
knight
caught
a
horse
by
the
rein
,
for
several
*NL*
which
had
been
taken
in
the
stables
of
Front-de-Boeuf
stood
accoutred
*NL*
around
,
and
were
a
valuable
part
of
the
booty
.
He
threw
himself
upon
the
*NL*
saddle
,
and
galloped
off
through
the
wood
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
bustle
occasioned
by
this
incident
was
somewhat
composed
,
the
*NL*
chief
Outlaw
took
from
his
neck
the
rich
horn
and
baldric
which
he
had
*NL*
recently
gained
at
the
strife
of
archery
near
Ashby
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Noble
knight
.
''
he
said
to
him
of
the
Fetterlock
,
``
if
you
disdain
not
to
*NL*
grace
by
your
acceptance
a
bugle
which
an
English
yeoman
has
once
worn
,
*NL*
this
I
will
pray
you
to
keep
as
a
memorial
of
your
gallant
bearing
--
and
*NL*
if
ye
have
aught
to
do
,
and
,
as
happeneth
oft
to
a
gallant
knight
,
ye
*NL*
chance
to
be
hard
bested
in
any
forest
between
Trent
and
Tees
,
wind
*NL*
three
mots
-LSB-
42
-RSB-
upon
the
horn
thus
,
`
Wa-sa-hoa
!
'
and
it
may
well
chance
*NL*
ye
shall
find
helpers
and
rescue
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
then
gave
breath
to
the
bugle
,
and
winded
once
and
again
the
call
*NL*
which
he
described
,
until
the
knight
had
caught
the
notes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gramercy
for
the
gift
,
bold
yeoman
,
''
said
the
Knight
;
``
and
better
help
*NL*
than
thine
and
thy
rangers
would
I
never
seek
,
were
it
at
my
utmost
*NL*
need
.
''
And
then
in
his
turn
he
winded
the
call
till
all
the
greenwood
*NL*
rang
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
blown
and
clearly
,
''
said
the
yeoman
;
``
beshrew
me
an
thou
knowest
*NL*
not
as
much
of
woodcraft
as
of
war
!
--
thou
hast
been
a
striker
of
deer
in
*NL*
thy
day
,
I
warrant
.
--
Comrades
,
mark
these
three
mots
--
it
is
the
call
of
*NL*
the
Knight
of
the
Fetterlock
;
and
he
who
hears
it
,
and
hastens
not
to
*NL*
serve
him
at
his
need
,
I
will
have
him
scourged
out
of
our
band
with
his
*NL*
own
bowstring
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Long
live
our
leader
!
''
shouted
the
yeomen
,
``
and
long
live
the
Black
*NL*
Knight
of
the
Fetterlock
!
--
May
he
soon
use
our
service
,
to
prove
how
*NL*
readily
it
will
be
paid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Locksley
now
proceeded
to
the
distribution
of
the
spoil
,
which
he
*NL*
performed
with
the
most
laudable
impartiality
.
A
tenth
part
of
the
whole
*NL*
was
set
apart
for
the
church
,
and
for
pious
uses
;
a
portion
was
next
*NL*
allotted
to
a
sort
of
public
treasury
;
a
part
was
assigned
to
the
widows
*NL*
and
children
of
those
who
had
fallen
,
or
to
be
expended
in
masses
for
*NL*
the
souls
of
such
as
had
left
no
surviving
family
.
The
rest
was
divided
*NL*
amongst
the
outlaws
,
according
to
their
rank
and
merit
,
and
the
judgment
*NL*
of
the
Chief
,
on
all
such
doubtful
questions
as
occurred
,
was
delivered
*NL*
with
great
shrewdness
,
and
received
with
absolute
submission
.
The
*NL*
Black
Knight
was
not
a
little
surprised
to
find
that
men
,
in
a
state
so
*NL*
lawless
,
were
nevertheless
among
themselves
so
regularly
and
equitably
*NL*
governed
,
and
all
that
he
observed
added
to
his
opinion
of
the
justice
*NL*
and
judgment
of
their
leader
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
each
had
taken
his
own
proportion
of
the
booty
,
and
while
the
*NL*
treasurer
,
accompanied
by
four
tall
yeomen
,
was
transporting
that
*NL*
belonging
to
the
state
to
some
place
of
concealment
or
of
security
,
the
*NL*
portion
devoted
to
the
church
still
remained
unappropriated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
,
''
said
the
leader
,
``
we
could
hear
tidings
of
our
joyous
*NL*
chaplain
--
he
was
never
wont
to
be
absent
when
meat
was
to
be
blessed
,
or
*NL*
spoil
to
be
parted
;
and
it
is
his
duty
to
take
care
of
these
the
tithes
*NL*
of
our
successful
enterprise
.
It
may
be
the
office
has
helped
to
cover
*NL*
some
of
his
canonical
irregularities
.
Also
,
I
have
a
holy
brother
of
his
*NL*
a
prisoner
at
no
great
distance
,
and
I
would
fain
have
the
Friar
to
help
*NL*
me
to
deal
with
him
in
due
sort
--
I
greatly
misdoubt
the
safety
of
the
*NL*
bluff
priest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
were
right
sorry
for
that
,
''
said
the
Knight
of
the
Fetterlock
,
``
for
I
*NL*
stand
indebted
to
him
for
the
joyous
hospitality
of
a
merry
night
in
his
*NL*
cell
.
Let
us
to
the
ruins
of
the
castle
;
it
may
be
we
shall
there
learn
*NL*
some
tidings
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
they
thus
spoke
,
a
loud
shout
among
the
yeomen
announced
the
*NL*
arrival
of
him
for
whom
they
feared
,
as
they
learned
from
the
stentorian
*NL*
voice
of
the
Friar
himself
,
long
before
they
saw
his
burly
person
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Make
room
,
my
merry-men
!
''
he
exclaimed
;
``
room
for
your
godly
father
*NL*
and
his
prisoner
--
Cry
welcome
once
more
.
--
I
come
,
noble
leader
,
like
an
*NL*
eagle
with
my
prey
in
my
clutch
.
''
--
And
making
his
way
through
the
ring
,
*NL*
amidst
the
laughter
of
all
around
,
he
appeared
in
majestic
triumph
,
his
*NL*
huge
partisan
in
one
hand
,
and
in
the
other
a
halter
,
one
end
of
which
*NL*
was
fastened
to
the
neck
of
the
unfortunate
Isaac
of
York
,
who
,
bent
*NL*
down
by
sorrow
and
terror
,
was
dragged
on
by
the
victorious
priest
,
who
*NL*
shouted
aloud
,
``
Where
is
Allan-a-Dale
,
to
chronicle
me
in
a
ballad
,
or
*NL*
if
it
were
but
a
lay
?
--
By
Saint
Hermangild
,
the
jingling
crowder
is
ever
*NL*
out
of
the
way
where
there
is
an
apt
theme
for
exalting
valour
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Curtal
Priest
,
''
said
the
Captain
,
``
thou
hast
been
at
a
wet
mass
this
*NL*
morning
,
as
early
as
it
is

In

Saint
Nicholas
,
whom
hast
*NL*
thou
got
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
captive
to
my
sword
and
to
my
lance

Captain

replied
the
*NL*
Clerk
of
Copmanhurst
;
``
to
my
bow
and
to
my
halberd

I
should
rather

by
my
divinity
from
a
worse
captivity

I
not

thine

Did
I
not
spend
*NL*
the
whole
night
in
drinking
to
thee

and
in
expounding
of
mysteries
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
the
love
of
God
!

ejaculated
the
poor
Jew
,
``
will
no
one
take
me
out
*NL*
of
the
keeping
of
this
mad
--
I
mean
this
holy
man

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
's
this

said
the
Friar
,
with
a
menacing
aspect
;
``
dost

Bethink

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
we
will
have
no

''
said
Locksley
;
``
let
us
*NL*
rather
hear
where
you
found
this
prisoner
of
thine

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
Saint
Dunstan
,
''
said
the
Friar
,
``
I
found
him
where
I
sought
for
*NL*
better
ware
!
I
did
step
into
the
cellarage
to
see
what
might
be
rescued
*NL*
there
;
for
though
a
cup
of
burnt
wine
,
with
spice
,
be
an
evening
's
*NL*
drought
for
an
emperor
,
it
were
waste
,
methought
,
to
let
so
much
good
*NL*
liquor
be
mulled
at
once
;
and
I
had
caught
up
one
runlet
of
sack
,
and
*NL*
was
coming
to
call
more
aid
among
these
lazy
knaves
,
who
are
ever
to
*NL*
seek
when
a
good
deed
is
to
be
done
,
when
I
was
avised
of
a
strong
*NL*
door
--
Aha
!
thought
I
,
here
is
the
choicest
juice
of
all
in
this
secret
*NL*
crypt
;
and
the
knave
butler
,
being
disturbed
in
his
vocation
,
hath
left
*NL*
the
key
in
the
door
--
In
therefore
I
went
,
and
found
just
nought
besides
*NL*
a
commodity
of
rusted
chains
and
this
dog
of
a
Jew
,
who
presently
*NL*
rendered
himself
my
prisoner
,
rescue
or
no
rescue
.
I
did
but
refresh
*NL*
myself
after
the
fatigue
of
the
action
,
with
the
unbeliever
,
with
one
*NL*
humming
cup
of
sack
,
and
was
proceeding
to
lead
forth
my
captive
,
*NL*
when
,
crash
after
crash
,
as
with
wild
thunder-dint
and
levin-fire
,
down
*NL*
toppled
the
masonry
of
an
outer
tower
,
-LRB-
marry
beshrew
their
hands
that
*NL*
built
it
not
the
firmer
!
-RRB-
and
blocked
up
the
passage
.
The
roar
of
one
*NL*
falling
tower
followed
another
--
I
gave
up
thought
of
life
;
and
deeming
*NL*
it
a
dishonour
to
one
of
my
profession
to
pass
out
of
this
world
in
*NL*
company
with
a
Jew
,
I
heaved
up
my
halberd
to
beat
his
brains
out
;
but
*NL*
I
took
pity
on
his
grey
hairs
,
and
judged
it
better
to
lay
down
the
*NL*
partisan
,
and
take
up
my
spiritual
weapon
for
his
conversion
.
And
truly
,
*NL*
by
the
blessing
of
Saint
Dunstan
,
the
seed
has
been
sown
in
good
soil
;
*NL*
only
that
,
with
speaking
to
him
of
mysteries
through
the
whole
night
,
*NL*
and
being
in
a
manner
fasting
,
-LRB-
for
the
few
droughts
of
sack
which
I
*NL*
sharpened
my
wits
with
were
not
worth
marking
,
-RRB-
my
head
is
well-nigh
*NL*
dizzied
,
I
trow
.
--
But
I
was
clean
exhausted
.
--
Gilbert
and
Wibbald
know
*NL*
in
what
state
they
found
me
--
quite
and
clean
exhausted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
can
bear
witness
,
''
said
Gilbert
;
``
for
when
we
had
cleared
away
the
*NL*
ruin
,
and
by
Saint
Dunstan

help
lighted
upon
the
dungeon
stair
,
we
*NL*
found
the
runlet
of
sack
half
empty
,
the
Jew
half
dead
,
and
the
Friar
*NL*
more
than
half

exhausted

as
he
calls
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye

retorted
the
offended

the

*NL*
word
which
the
reverend
prelate
spake
to
me
all
this
fearful
night

*NL*
Alas
!
I
was
so
distraught
with
agony
,
and
fear
,
and
grief
,
that
had
*NL*
our
holy
father
Abraham
come
to
preach
to
me

had
found
but
a
deaf
*NL*
listener
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
liest

thou
knowest

said
the
Friar
;
``
I
will
*NL*
remind
thee
of
but
one
word
of

thou
didst
promise
to

thy

holy
Order

*NL*
*NL*
``
So
help
me

Isaac
,
even
more
alarmed
than
*NL*
before
,
``

no

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay

said
the
Friar
,
``

dost
retract
vows
made
in
favour
of

must
do
penance

*NL*
*NL*
Accordingly
,
he
raised
his
halberd
,
and
would
have
laid
the
staff
of
*NL*
it
lustily
on
the
Jew
's
shoulders
,
had
not
the
Black
Knight
stopped
the
*NL*
blow
,
and
thereby
transferred
the
Holy
Clerk
's
resentment
to
himself
.

*NL*
*NL*
``

take

provoking

host

``

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
``

cried
the
Captain
,
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

said
the
Knight

*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
hast
the

the

churchman

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Friar
bared
his
brawny
arm
up
to
the
elbow
,
and
putting
his
full
*NL*
strength
to
the
blow
,
gave
the
Knight
a
buffet
that
might
have
felled
an
*NL*
ox
.
But
his
adversary
stood
firm
as
a
rock
.
A
loud
shout
was
uttered
by
*NL*
all
the
yeomen
around
;
for
the
Clerk
's
cuff
was
proverbial
amongst
them
,
*NL*
and
there
were
few
who
,
in
jest
or
earnest
,
had
not
had
the
occasion
to
*NL*
know
its
vigour
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now

''
said
,
the
Knight
,
pulling
off
his
gauntlet
,
``
if
I
had
*NL*
vantage
on

I
will
have

the
Priest
;

will
*NL*
freely
bestow

''
*NL*
*NL*
So
spoke
the
burly
Priest
,
assuming
,
on
his
part
,
high
defiance
.
But
*NL*
who
may
resist
his
fate
?
The
buffet
of
the
Knight
was
given
with
such
*NL*
strength
and
good-will
,
that
the
Friar
rolled
head
over
heels
upon
*NL*
the
plain
,
to
the
great
amazement
of
all
the
spectators
.
But
he
arose
*NL*
neither
angry
nor
crestfallen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brother

''
said
he
to
the
Knight
,
``
thou
shouldst
have
used
thy
strength

I

*NL*
broken
my
jaw

Nevertheless

there

End
*NL*

Let

put
the

to

not

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Priest

said
Clement
,

is
not

so
confident

*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou

forth

tell
us
at

``
O

said
Isaac

I

trafficked

also
much

him
aside

He

an
order
sealed
with
his
signet
,
to
a
brother
of
his
*NL*
tribe
at
York
,
requiring
him
to
pay
to
the
bearer
the
sum
of
a
thousand
*NL*
crowns
,
and
to
deliver
certain
merchandises
specified
in
the
note
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
brother
Sheva
,
''
he
said
,
groaning
deeply
,
``
hath
the
key
of
my
*NL*
warehouses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
of
the
vaulted
chamber

''
whispered
Locksley
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
--
may
Heaven
forefend
!
''
said
Isaac
;
``
evil
is
the
hour
that
let
*NL*
any
one
whomsoever
into
that
secret
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
safe
with
me
,
''
said
the
Outlaw
,
``
so
be
that
this
thy
scroll
*NL*
produce
the
sum
therein
nominated
and
set
down
.
--
But
what
now
,
Isaac
?
*NL*
art
dead
?
art
stupefied
?
hath
the
payment
of
a
thousand
crowns
put
thy
*NL*
daughter
's
peril
out
of
thy
mind
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Jew
started
to
his
feet
--
``
No
,
Diccon
,
no
--
I
will
presently
set
*NL*
forth
.
--
Farewell
,
thou
whom
I
may
not
call
good
,
and
dare
not
and
will
*NL*
not
call
evil
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
ere
Isaac
departed
,
the
Outlaw
Chief
bestowed
on
him
this
parting
*NL*
advice
:
--
``
Be
liberal
of
thine
offers
,
Isaac
,
and
spare
not
thy
purse
for
*NL*
thy
daughter
's
safety
.
Credit
me
,
that
the
gold
thou
shalt
spare
in
*NL*
her
cause
,
will
hereafter
give
thee
as
much
agony
as
if
it
were
poured
*NL*
molten
down
thy
throat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isaac
acquiesced
with
a
deep
groan
,
and
set
forth
on
his
journey
,
*NL*
accompanied
by
two
tall
foresters
,
who
were
to
be
his
guides
,
and
at
the
*NL*
same
time
his
guards
,
through
the
wood
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Black
Knight
,
who
had
seen
with
no
small
interest
these
various
*NL*
proceedings
,
now
took
his
leave
of
the
Outlaw
in
turn
;
nor
could
he
*NL*
avoid
expressing
his
surprise
at
having
witnessed
so
much
of
civil
*NL*
policy
amongst
persons
cast
out
from
all
the
ordinary
protection
and
*NL*
influence
of
the
laws
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
fruit
,
Sir
Knight
,
''
said
the
yeoman
,
``
will
sometimes
grow
on
a
*NL*
sorry
tree
;
and
evil
times
are
not
always
productive
of
evil
alone
and
*NL*
unmixed
.
Amongst
those
who
are
drawn
into
this
lawless
state
,
there
*NL*
are
,
doubtless
,
numbers
who
wish
to
exercise
its
license
with
some
*NL*
moderation
,
and
some
who
regret
,
it
may
be
,
that
they
are
obliged
to
*NL*
follow
such
a
trade
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
to
one
of
those
,
''
said
the
Knight
,
``
I
am
now
,
I
presume
,
speaking
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
Knight
,
''
said
the
Outlaw
,
``
we
have
each
our
secret
.
You
are
welcome
*NL*
to
form
your
judgment
of
me
,
and
I
may
use
my
conjectures
touching
you
,
*NL*
though
neither
of
our
shafts
may
hit
the
mark
they
are
shot
at
.
But
as
*NL*
I
do
not
pray
to
be
admitted
into
your
mystery
,
be
not
offended
that
I
*NL*
preserve
my
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
crave
pardon
,
brave
Outlaw
,
''
said
the
Knight
,
``
your
reproof
is
just
.
*NL*
But
it
may
be
we
shall
meet
hereafter
with
less
of
concealment
on
either
*NL*
side
.
--
Meanwhile
we
part
friends
,
do
we
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
my
hand
upon
it
,
''
said
Locksley
;
``
and
I
will
call
it
the
hand
*NL*
of
a
true
Englishman
,
though
an
outlaw
for
the
present
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
there
is
mine
in
return
,
''
said
the
Knight
,
``
and
I
hold
it
honoured
*NL*
by
being
clasped
with
yours
.
For
he
that
does
good
,
having
the
unlimited
*NL*
power
to
do
evil
,
deserves
praise
not
only
for
the
good
which
he
*NL*
performs
,
but
for
the
evil
which
he
forbears
.
Fare
thee
well
,
gallant
*NL*
Outlaw
!
''
Thus
parted
that
fair
fellowship
;
and
He
of
the
Fetterlock
,
*NL*
mounting
upon
his
strong
war-horse
,
rode
off
through
the
forest

CHAPTER
XXXIV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
KING
JOHN
.
--
I
'll
tell
thee
what
,
my
friend
,
*NL*
He
is
a
very
serpent
in
my
way
;
*NL*
And
wheresoe'er
this
foot
of
mine
doth
tread
,
*NL*
He
lies
before
me
.
--
Dost
thou
understand
me
?
*NL*
--
King
John
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
brave
feasting
in
the
Castle
of
York
,
to
which
Prince
John
*NL*
had
invited
those
nobles
,
prelates
,
and
leaders
,
by
whose
assistance
he
*NL*
hoped
to
carry
through
his
ambitious
projects
upon
his
brother
's
throne
.
*NL*
Waldemar
Fitzurse
,
his
able
and
politic
agent
,
was
at
secret
work
among
*NL*
them
,
tempering
all
to
that
pitch
of
courage
which
was
necessary
in
*NL*
making
an
open
declaration
of
their
purpose
.
But
their
enterprise
was
*NL*
delayed
by
the
absence
of
more
than
one
main
limb
of
the
confederacy
.
*NL*
The
stubborn
and
daring
,
though
brutal
courage
of
Front-de-Boeuf
;
the
*NL*
buoyant
spirits
and
bold
bearing
of
De
Bracy
;
the
sagacity
,
martial
*NL*
experience
,
and
renowned
valour
of
Brian
de
Bois-Guilbert
,
were
*NL*
important
to
the
success
of
their
conspiracy
;
and
,
while
cursing
in
*NL*
secret
their
unnecessary
and
unmeaning
absence
,
neither
John
nor
his
*NL*
adviser
dared
to
proceed
without
them
.
Isaac
the
Jew
also
seemed
to
have
*NL*
vanished
,
and
with
him
the
hope
of
certain
sums
of
money
,
making
up
the
*NL*
subsidy
for
which
Prince
John
had
contracted
with
that
Israelite
and
his
*NL*
brethren
.
This
deficiency
was
likely
to
prove
perilous
in
an
emergency
*NL*
so
critical
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
on
the
morning
after
the
fall
of
Torquilstone
,
that
a
confused
*NL*
report
began
to
spread
abroad
in
the
city
of
York
,
that
De
Bracy
and
*NL*
Bois-Guilbert
,
with
their
confederate
Front-de-Boeuf
,
had
been
taken
or
*NL*
slain
.
Waldemar
brought
the
rumour
to
Prince
John
,
announcing
,
that
he
*NL*
feared
its
truth
the
more
that
they
had
set
out
with
a
small
attendance
,
*NL*
for
the
purpose
of
committing
an
assault
on
the
Saxon
Cedric
and
his
*NL*
attendants
.
At
another
time
the
Prince
would
have
treated
this
deed
of
*NL*
violence
as
a
good
jest
;
but
now
,
that
it
interfered
with
and
impeded
*NL*
his
own
plans
,
he
exclaimed
against
the
perpetrators
,
and
spoke
of
*NL*
the
broken
laws
,
and
the
infringement
of
public
order
and
of
private
*NL*
property
,
in
a
tone
which
might
have
become
King
Alfred
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
unprincipled
marauders
,
''
he
said
--
``
were
I
ever
to
become
monarch
of
*NL*
England
,
I
would
hang
such
transgressors
over
the
drawbridges
of
their
*NL*
own
castles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
to
become
monarch
of
England
,
''
said
his
Ahithophel
coolly
,
``
it
is
*NL*
necessary
not
only
that
your
Grace
should
endure
the
transgressions
*NL*
of
these
unprincipled
marauders
,
but
that
you
should
afford
them
your
*NL*
protection
,
notwithstanding
your
laudable
zeal
for
the
laws
they
are
in
*NL*
the
habit
of
infringing
.
We
shall
be
finely
helped
,
if
the
churl
*NL*
Saxons
should
have
realized
your
Grace
's
vision
,
of
converting
feudal
*NL*
drawbridges
into
gibbets
;
and
yonder
bold-spirited
Cedric
seemeth
one
to
*NL*
whom
such
an
imagination
might
occur
.
Your
Grace
is
well
aware
,
it
will
*NL*
be
dangerous
to
stir
without
Front-de-Boeuf
,
De
Bracy
,
and
the
Templar
;
*NL*
and
yet
we
have
gone
too
far
to
recede
with
safety
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
John
struck
his
forehead
with
impatience
,
and
then
began
to
*NL*
stride
up
and
down
the
apartment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
villains
,
''
he
said
,
``
the
base
treacherous
villains
,
to
desert
me
at
*NL*
this
pinch
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
say
rather
the
feather-pated
giddy
madmen
,
''
said
Waldemar
,
``
who
*NL*
must
be
toying
with
follies
when
such
business
was
in
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
to
be
done
?
''
said
the
Prince
,
stopping
short
before
Waldemar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
nothing
which
can
be
done
,
''
answered
his
counsellor
,
``
save
that
*NL*
which
I
have
already
taken
order
for
.
--
I
came
not
to
bewail
this
evil
*NL*
chance
with
your
Grace
,
until
I
had
done
my
best
to
remedy
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
art
ever
my
better
angel
,
Waldemar
,
''
said
the
Prince
;
``
and
when
*NL*
I
have
such
a
chancellor
to
advise
withal
,
the
reign
of
John
will
be
*NL*
renowned
in
our
annals
.
--
What
hast
thou
commanded
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
ordered
Louis
Winkelbrand
,
De
Bracy
's
lieutenant
,
to
cause
his
*NL*
trumpet
sound
to
horse
,
and
to
display
his
banner
,
and
to
set
presently
*NL*
forth
towards
the
castle
of
Front-de-Boeuf
,
to
do
what
yet
may
be
done
*NL*
for
the
succour
of
our
friends

''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
John
's
face
flushed
with
the
pride
of
a
spoilt
child
,
who
has
*NL*
undergone
what
it
conceives
to
be
an
insult
.
``
By
the
face
of
God
!
''
*NL*
he
said
,
``
Waldemar
Fitzurse
,
much
hast
thou
taken
upon
thee

over

wert
to

to

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
crave
your

pardon

said
Fitzurse
,
internally
cursing
the
*NL*
idle
vanity
of
his
patron
;
``
but
when
time
pressed
,

even
the
loss

judged

take

importance

your

's
interest

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
the
prince

gravely
;
``

hath
atoned
for

hasty
rashness

But

here

*NL*
himself

by
the
rood
!

and
in
strange
guise
doth
he
come
before

*NL*
*NL*
It
was
indeed
De
Bracy
--
``
bloody
with
spurring
,
fiery
red
with
speed
.
''
*NL*
His
armour
bore
all
the
marks
of
the
late
obstinate
fray
,
being
broken
,
*NL*
defaced
,
and
stained
with
blood
in
many
places
,
and
covered
with
clay
*NL*
and
dust
from
the
crest
to
the
spur
.
Undoing
his
helmet
,
he
placed
it
*NL*
on
the
table
,
and
stood
a
moment
as
if
to
collect
himself
before
he
told
*NL*
his
news
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
De
Bracy

Prince
John

in

De

;

,
coming
up
*NL*
to
Prince
John

he
uttered
in
a
low
and
emphatic
tone

Richard

*NL*
*NL*
Prince
John
turned
pale

tottered

caught
at
the
back

an
oaken

bench
to
support
himself

much
like
to

receives
an
arrow
in

his
bosom

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*

No

Waldemar

*NL*
*NL*

her
to

maintain

De

.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
so

answered
Fitzurse
;

will
take
sanctuary

*NL*
During
this
discourse
,
Prince
John
had
gradually
awakened
from
the
*NL*
stupor
into
which
he
had
been
thrown
by
the
unexpected
intelligence
,
*NL*
and
had
been
attentive
to
the
conversation
which
passed
betwixt
his
*NL*
followers
.
``
They
fall
off
from
me
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
they
hold
no
*NL*
more
by
me
than
a
withered
leaf
by
the
bough
when
a
breeze
blows
on
*NL*
it
!
--
Hell
and
fiends
!
can
I
shape
no
means
for
myself
when
I
am
deserted
*NL*
by
these
cravens
?
''
--
He
paused
,
and
there
was
an
expression
of
diabolical
*NL*
passion
in
the
constrained
laugh
with
which
he
at
length
broke
in
on
*NL*
their
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
you

De
Bracy
.

As

abroad

at

all
is
then
over

with

I
would
counsel
you

*NL*

I
seek
no

Prince
John

haughtily
;

Waldemar
*NL*
Fitzurse
and
De
Bracy
looked
in
each
other
's
faces
with
blank
*NL*
dismay
.

``
There
is
but
one
road
to

continued
the
Prince
,

*NL*
his
brow
grew
black
as
midnight

*NL*
*NL*
Arouse
the
tiger
of
Hyrcanian
deserts
,
*NL*
Strive
with
the
half-starved
lion
for
his
prey
;
*NL*
Lesser
the
risk
,
than
rouse
the
slumbering
fire
*NL*
Of
wild
Fanaticism
.
*NL*
--
Anonymus
*NL*
*NL*
Our
tale
now
returns
to
Isaac
of
York
.
--
Mounted
upon
a
mule
,
the
gift
of
*NL*
the
Outlaw
,
with
two
tall
yeomen
to
act
as
his
guard
and
guides
,
the
*NL*
Jew
had
set
out
for
the
Preceptory
of
Templestowe
,
for
the
purpose
of
*NL*
negotiating
his
daughter
's
redemption
.
The
Preceptory
was
but
a
day
's
*NL*
journey
from
the
demolished
castle
of
Torquilstone
,
and
the
Jew
had
*NL*
hoped
to
reach
it
before
nightfall
;
accordingly
,
having
dismissed
his
*NL*
guides
at
the
verge
of
the
forest
,
and
rewarded
them
with
a
piece
of
*NL*
silver
,
he
began
to
press
on
with
such
speed
as
his
weariness
permitted
*NL*
him
to
exert
.
But
his
strength
failed
him
totally
ere
he
had
reached
*NL*
within
four
miles
of
the
Temple-Court
;
racking
pains
shot
along
his
back
*NL*
and
through
his
limbs
,
and
the
excessive
anguish
which
he
felt
at
heart
*NL*
being
now
augmented
by
bodily
suffering
,
he
was
rendered
altogether
*NL*
incapable
of
proceeding
farther
than
a
small
market-town
,
were
dwelt
*NL*
a
Jewish
Rabbi
of
his
tribe
,
eminent
in
the
medical
profession
,
and
*NL*
to
whom
Isaac
was
well
known
.
Nathan
Ben
Israel
received
his
suffering
*NL*
countryman
with
that
kindness
which
the
law
prescribed
,
and
which
the
*NL*
Jews
practised
to
each
other
.
He
insisted
on
his
betaking
himself
to
*NL*
repose
,
and
used
such
remedies
as
were
then
in
most
repute
to
check
the
*NL*
progress
of
the
fever
,
which
terror
,
fatigue
,
ill
usage
,
and
sorrow
,
had
*NL*
brought
upon
the
poor
old
Jew
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
morrow
,
when
Isaac
proposed
to
arise
and
pursue
his
journey
,
*NL*
Nathan
remonstrated
against
his
purpose
,
both
as
his
host
and
as
his
*NL*
physician
.
It
might
cost
him
,
he
said
,
his
life
.
But
Isaac
replied
,
*NL*
that
more
than
life
and
death
depended
upon
his
going
that
morning
to
*NL*
Templestowe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
Templestowe
!
''
said
his
host
with
surprise
again
felt
his
pulse
,
*NL*
and
then
muttered
to
himself
,
``
His
fever
is
abated
,
yet
seems
his
mind
*NL*
somewhat
alienated
and
disturbed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
not
to
Templestowe
?
''
answered
his
patient
.
``
I
grant
thee
,
*NL*
Nathan
,
that
it
is
a
dwelling
of
those
to
whom
the
despised
Children
of
*NL*
the
Promise
are
a
stumbling-block
and
an
abomination
;
yet
thou
knowest
*NL*
that
pressing
affairs
of
traffic
sometimes
carry
us
among
these
*NL*
bloodthirsty
Nazarene
soldiers
,
and
that
we
visit
the
Preceptories
of
*NL*
the
Templars
,
as
well
as
the
Commanderies
of
the
Knights
Hospitallers
,
*NL*
as
they
are
called
.

*NL*
``
I
know
it
well

said
Nathan
;
``
but
wottest
thou
that
Lucas
de

Beaumanoir
,
the
chief
of
their
Order
,

whom

Grand
Master

*NL*
is
now
himself
at
Templestowe

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it
not
,
''
said
Isaac
;
``
our
last
letters
from
our
brethren
at
*NL*
Paris
advised
us
that
he
was
at
that
city
,
beseeching
Philip
for
aid
*NL*
against
the
Sultan
Saladine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
hath
since
come
to
England
,
unexpected
by
his

''
said
Ben
*NL*
Israel
;
``
and
he
cometh
among
them
with
a
strong
and
outstretched
arm
to
*NL*
correct
and
to
punish
.
His
countenance
is
kindled
in
anger
against
those
*NL*
who
have
departed
from
the
vow
which
they
have
made
,
and
great
is
the
*NL*
fear
of
those
sons
of
Belial
.
Thou
must
have
heard
of
his
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
well
known
unto
me
,
''
said
Isaac
;
``
the
Gentiles
deliver
this
Lucas
*NL*
Beaumanoir
as
a
man
zealous
to
slaying
for
every
point
of
the
Nazarene
*NL*
law
;
and
our
brethren
have
termed
him
a
fierce
destroyer
of
the
*NL*
Saracens
,
and
a
cruel
tyrant
to
the
Children
of
the
Promise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
truly
have
they
termed
him
,
''
said
Nathan
the
physician
.
``
Other
*NL*
Templars
may
be
moved
from
the
purpose
of
their
heart
by
pleasure
,
or
*NL*
bribed
by
promise
of
gold
and
silver
;
but
Beaumanoir
is
of
a
different
*NL*
stamp
--
hating
sensuality
,
despising
treasure
,
and
pressing
forward
to
*NL*
that
which
they
call
the
crown
of
martyrdom
--
The
God
of
Jacob
speedily
*NL*
send
it
unto
him
,
and
unto
them
all
!
Specially
hath
this
proud
man
*NL*
extended
his
glove
over
the
children
of
Judah
,
as
holy
David
over
Edom
,
*NL*
holding
the
murder
of
a
Jew
to
be
an
offering
of
as
sweet
savour
as
the
*NL*
death
of
a
Saracen
.
Impious
and
false
things
has
he
said
even
of
the
*NL*
virtues
of
our
medicines
,
as
if
they
were
the
devices
of
Satan
--
The
Lord
*NL*
rebuke
him

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nevertheless
,
''
said
Isaac
,
``
I
must
present
myself
at
Templestowe
,
*NL*
though
he
hath
made
his
face
like
unto
a
fiery
furnace
seven
times
*NL*
heated
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
then
explained
to
Nathan
the
pressing
cause
of
his
journey
.
The
Rabbi
*NL*
listened
with
interest
,
and
testified
his
sympathy
after
the
fashion
of
*NL*
his
people
,
rending
his
clothes
,
and
saying
,
``
Ah
,
my
daughter
!
--
ah
,
my
*NL*
daughter
!
--
Alas
!
for
the
beauty
of
Zion
!
--
Alas

for
the
captivity
of
*NL*
Israel
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
seest
,
''
said
Isaac
,
``
how
it
stands
with
me
,
and
that
I
may
not
*NL*
tarry
.
Peradventure
,
the
presence
of
this
Lucas
Beaumanoir
,
being
the
*NL*
chief
man
over
them
,
may
turn
Brian
de
Bois-Guilbert
from
the
ill
which
*NL*
he
doth
meditate
,
and
that
he
may
deliver
to
me
my
beloved
daughter
*NL*
Rebecca
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
thou
,
''
said
Nathan
Ben
Israel
,
``
and
be
wise
,
for
wisdom
availed
*NL*
Daniel
in
the
den
of
lions
into
which
he
was
cast
;
and
may
it
go
well
*NL*
with
thee
,
even
as
thine
heart
wisheth
.
Yet
,
if
thou
canst
,
keep
thee
*NL*
from
the
presence
of
the
Grand
Master
,
for
to
do
foul
scorn
to
our
*NL*
people

his
morning
and
evening
delight
.
It
may
be
if
thou
couldst
*NL*
speak
with
Bois-Guilbert
in
private
,
thou
shalt
the
better
prevail
with
*NL*
him
;
for
men
say
that
these
accursed
Nazarenes
are
not
of
one
mind
in
*NL*
the
Preceptory

May
their
counsels
be
confounded

brought
to
shame

do
thou

return
to
me

it
were
to
the
house

me
word

sped
with
thee

well
do
I
hope

wilt
bring
with
thee
Rebecca

even
the
scholar
of
the
wise
Miriam
,
*NL*
whose
cures
the
Gentiles
slandered
as
if
they
had
been
wrought
by
*NL*
necromancy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isaac
accordingly
bade
his
friend
farewell
,
and
about
an
hour
's
riding
*NL*
brought
him
before
the
Preceptory
of
Templestowe
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
establishment
of
the
Templars
was
seated
amidst
fair
meadows
and
*NL*
pastures
,
which
the
devotion
of
the
former
Preceptor
had
bestowed
upon
*NL*
their
Order
.
It
was
strong
and
well
fortified
,
a
point
never
neglected
*NL*
by
these
knights
,
and
which
the
disordered
state
of
England
rendered
*NL*
peculiarly
necessary
.
Two
halberdiers
,
clad
in
black
,
guarded
the
*NL*
drawbridge
,
and
others
,
in
the
same
sad
livery
,
glided
to
and
fro
upon
*NL*
the
walls
with
a
funereal
pace
,
resembling
spectres
more
than
soldiers
.
*NL*
The
inferior
officers
of
the
Order
were
thus
dressed
,
ever
since
their
*NL*
use
of
white
garments
,
similar
to
those
of
the
knights
and
esquires
,
had
*NL*
given
rise
to
a
combination
of
certain
false
brethren
in
the
mountains
*NL*
of
Palestine
,
terming
themselves
Templars
,
and
bringing
great
dishonour
*NL*
on
the
Order
.
A
knight
was
now
and
then
seen
to
cross
the
court
in
his
*NL*
long
white
cloak
,
his
head
depressed
on
his
breast
,
and
his
arms
folded
.
*NL*
They
passed
each
other
,
if
they
chanced
to
meet
,
with
a
slow
,
solemn
,
*NL*
and
mute
greeting
;
for
such
was
the
rule
of
their
Order
,
quoting
*NL*
thereupon
the
holy
texts
,
``
In
many
words
thou
shalt
not
avoid
sin
,
''
and
*NL*
``
Life
and
death
are
in
the
power
of
the
tongue
.
''
In
a
word
,
the
*NL*
stern
ascetic
rigour
of
the
Temple
discipline
,
which
had
been
so
long
*NL*
exchanged
for
prodigal
and
licentious
indulgence
,
seemed
at
once
to
have
*NL*
revived
at
Templestowe
under
the
severe
eye
of
Lucas
Beaumanoir
.
*NL*
*NL*
Isaac
paused
at
the
gate
,
to
consider
how
he
might
seek
entrance
in
the
*NL*
manner
most
likely
to
bespeak
favour
;
for
he
was
well
aware
,
that
to
his
*NL*
unhappy
race
the
reviving
fanaticism
of
the
Order
was
not
less
dangerous
*NL*
than
their
unprincipled
licentiousness
;
and
that
his
religion
would
be
*NL*
the
object
of
hate
and
persecution
in
the
one
case
,
as
his
wealth
*NL*
would
have
exposed
him
in
the
other
to
the
extortions
of
unrelenting
*NL*
oppression
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meantime
Lucas
Beaumanoir
walked
in
a
small
garden
belonging
to
the
*NL*
Preceptory
,
included
within
the
precincts
of
its
exterior
fortification
,
*NL*
and
held
sad
and
confidential
communication
with
a
brother
of
his
Order
,
*NL*
who
had
come
in
his
company
from
Palestine
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Grand
Master
was
a
man
advanced
in
age
,
as
was
testified
by
his
long
*NL*
grey
beard
,
and
the
shaggy
grey
eyebrows
overhanging
eyes
,
of
which
,
*NL*
however
,
years
had
been
unable
to
quench
the
fire
.
A
formidable
warrior
,
*NL*
his
thin
and
severe
features
retained
the
soldier
's
fierceness
of
*NL*
expression
;
an
ascetic
bigot
,
they
were
no
less
marked
by
the
emaciation
*NL*
of
abstinence
,
and
the
spiritual
pride
of
the
self-satisfied
devotee
.
*NL*
Yet
with
these
severer
traits
of
physiognomy
,
there
was
mixed
somewhat
*NL*
striking
and
noble
,
arising
,
doubtless
,
from
the
great
part
which
his
*NL*
high
office
called
upon
him
to
act
among
monarchs
and
princes
,
and
*NL*
from
the
habitual
exercise
of
supreme
authority
over
the
valiant
and
*NL*
high-born
knights
,
who
were
united
by
the
rules
of
the
Order
.
His
*NL*
stature
was
tall
,
and
his
gait
,
undepressed
by
age
and
toil
,
was
*NL*
erect
and
stately
.
His
white
mantle
was
shaped
with
severe
regularity
,
*NL*
according
to
the
rule
of
Saint
Bernard
himself
,
being
composed
of
what
*NL*
was
then
called
Burrel
cloth
,
exactly
fitted
to
the
size
of
the
wearer
,
*NL*
and
bearing
on
the
left
shoulder
the
octangular
cross
peculiar
to
the
*NL*
Order
,
formed
of
red
cloth
.
No
vair
or
ermine
decked
this
garment
;
but
*NL*
in
respect
of
his
age
,
the
Grand
Master
,
as
permitted
by
the
rules
,
wore
*NL*
his
doublet
lined
and
trimmed
with
the
softest
lambskin
,
dressed
with
*NL*
the
wool
outwards
,
which
was
the
nearest
approach
he
could
regularly
*NL*
make
to
the
use
of
fur
,
then
the
greatest
luxury
of
dress
.
In
his
hand
*NL*
he
bore
that
singular
``
abacus
''
,
or
staff
of
office
,
with
which
Templars
*NL*
are
usually
represented
,
having
at
the
upper
end
a
round
plate
,
on
which
*NL*
was
engraved
the
cross
of
the
Order
,
inscribed
within
a
circle
or
orle
,
*NL*
as
heralds
term
it
.
His
companion
,
who
attended
on
this
great
personage
,
*NL*
had
nearly
the
same
dress
in
all
respects
,
but
his
extreme
deference
*NL*
towards
his
Superior
showed
that
no
other
equality
subsisted
between
*NL*
them
.
The
Preceptor
,
for
such
he
was
in
rank
,
walked
not
in
a
line
with
*NL*
the
Grand
Master
,
but
just
so
far
behind
that
Beaumanoir
could
speak
to
*NL*
him
without
turning
round
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Conrade
,
''
said
the
Grand
Master
,
``
dear
companion
of
my
battles
and
my
*NL*
toils
,
to
thy
faithful
bosom
alone
I
can
confide
my
sorrows
.
To
thee
*NL*
alone
can
I
tell
how
oft
,
since
I
came
to
this
kingdom
,
I
have
desired
*NL*
to
be
dissolved
and
to
be
with
the
just
.
Not
one
object
in
England
hath
*NL*
met
mine
eye
which
it
could
rest
upon
with
pleasure
,
save

O

did
I
exclaim
internally

gazed
upon

sculptured

O

open
your

and
take
to
your
repose
a
weary
brother

who
would
rather
strive
*NL*

witness
the
decay

*NL*
``

answered
Conrade

``
it

*NL*

answered
the

``
Bear
with
*NL*
me

I
should
something
vaunt

Thou

have
led

keeping

striving
with

What

how

They

They

They

their

They

thrice

the

behold

groan

Their

the

,
*NL*
filled
as

better

I
have
seen
them

in
the

their
sainted
eyes
shed
tears
for
the

of
their

for
the
foul

shameful
luxury
in
which
they
wallow
.
*NL*
Beaumanoir

say
,
thou

There
is

deep

*NL*
``

the

*NL*
*NL*
Beaumanoir
,
being
thus
possessed
of
the

inspected
the
outside

carefully

then
proceeded
to
undo
the

secured
its

with

*NL*
He
then
perused
the

with
an
expression

over

to

something
apart

*NL*
Conrade
was
better
acquainted
-LRB-
perhaps
by
practice
-RRB-
with
the
jargon
of
*NL*
gallantry
,
than
was
his
Superior
;
and
he
expounded
the
passage
which
*NL*
embarrassed
the

to
be
a
sort
of
language
used
by
worldly
*NL*
men

those

they
loved

the
explanation
did
*NL*
not
satisfy
the
bigoted
Beaumanoir

*NL*
*NL*
``

in

Conrade

no

deep
abyss

Thou

Then
turning
to
Isaac

he
said
aloud

*NL*
*NL*
Beaumanoir
turned
to

with
a
grim
smile

in

of
the
powers
of
darkness
--
``

thus
he
went
on
to
address

*NL*
``

Beaumanoir

exclaimed
the

crossing

himself
.
``
Her

burnt

*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Isaac
was
hurried
off
accordingly
,
and
expelled
from
the
*NL*
preceptory
;
all
his
entreaties
,
and
even
his
offers
,
unheard

*NL*
disregarded
.
He
could
do
not
better
than
return
to
the
house
of
the
*NL*
Rabbi
,
and
endeavour
,
through
his
means
,
to
learn
how
his
daughter
was
*NL*
to
be
disposed
of
.
He
had
hitherto
feared
for
her
honour

he
was
now
*NL*
to
tremble

Albert

,
President
,
or
,
in
the
language
of
the
Order
,
Preceptor
*NL*
of
the
establishment
of
Templestowe
,
was
brother
to
that
Philip
*NL*
Malvoisin
who
has
been
already
occasionally
mentioned
in
this
history
,
*NL*
and
was
,
like
that
baron
,
in
close
league
with
Brian
de
Bois-Guilbert
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amongst
dissolute
and
unprincipled
men
,
of
whom
the
Temple
Order
*NL*
included
but
too
many
,
Albert
of
Templestowe
might
be
distinguished
;
but
*NL*
with
this
difference
from
the
audacious
Bois-Guilbert
,
that
he
knew
how
*NL*
to
throw
over
his
vices
and
his
ambition
the
veil
of
hypocrisy
,
and
to
*NL*
assume
in
his
exterior
the
fanaticism
which
he
internally
despised
.
*NL*
Had
not
the
arrival
of
the
Grand
Master
been
so
unexpectedly
sudden
,
*NL*
he
would
have
seen
nothing
at
Templestowe
which
might
have
appeared
to
*NL*
argue
any
relaxation
of
discipline
.
And
,
even
although
surprised
,
and
,
*NL*
to
a
certain
extent
,
detected
,
Albert
Malvoisin
listened
with
such
*NL*
respect
and
apparent
contrition
to
the
rebuke
of
his
Superior
,
and
made
*NL*
such
haste
to
reform
the
particulars
he
censured
,
--
succeeded
,
in
fine
,
*NL*
so
well
in
giving
an
air
of
ascetic
devotion
to
a
family
which
had
been
*NL*
lately
devoted
to
license
and
pleasure
,
that
Lucas
Beaumanoir
began
to
*NL*
entertain
a
higher
opinion
of
the
Preceptor
's
morals
,
than
the
first
*NL*
appearance
of
the
establishment
had
inclined
him
to
adopt
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
these
favourable
sentiments
on
the
part
of
the
Grand
Master
were
*NL*
greatly
shaken
by
the
intelligence
that
Albert
had
received
within
a
*NL*
house
of
religion
the
Jewish
captive
,
and
,
as
was
to
be
feared
,
the
*NL*
paramour
of
a
brother
of
the
Order
;
and
when
Albert
appeared
before
him
,
*NL*
he
was
regarded
with
unwonted
sternness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
in
this
mansion
,
dedicated
to
the
purposes
of
the
holy
Order
*NL*
of

said
the
Grand
Master
,
in
a
severe
tone
,
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
Albert
Malvoisin
was
overwhelmed
with
confusion
;
for
the
unfortunate
*NL*
Rebecca
had
been
confined
in
a
remote
and
secret
part
of
the
building
,
*NL*
and
every
precaution
used
to
prevent
her
residence
there
from
being
*NL*
known

He
read
in
the
looks
of
Beaumanoir
ruin
to
Bois-Guilbert
and
to
*NL*
himself
,
unless
he
should
be
able
to
avert
the
impending
storm

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

continued
the
Grand
Master
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
permitted
to
me
to
reply

answered
the
Preceptor
,
in
a
tone
of
*NL*
the
deepest
humility
,
although
by
the
question
he
only
meant
to
gain
an
*NL*
instant
's
space
for
arranging
his
ideas
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak

the

answered
the
Preceptor

rolled

away

Much
did
I
wonder
that
so
good
*NL*
a
knight
as
Brian
de
Bois-Guilbert
seemed
so
fondly
besotted
on
the
*NL*
charms
of
this
female
,
whom
I
received
into
this
house
merely
to
place
a
*NL*
bar
betwixt
their
growing
intimacy
,
which
else
might
have
been
cemented
*NL*
at
the
expense
of
the
fall
of

valiant

religious

*NL*
``

*NL*
demanded
the
Grand
Master

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
under

said
the
Preceptor

crossing
himself

if
I

sinned

it
was
in
the
erring
thought
that
I
might
thus
break
*NL*
off
our
brother

besotted
devotion
to
this
Jewess
,
which
seemed
to
me
*NL*
so
wild

unnatural
,
that
I
could
not
but
ascribe
it
to
some
touch
of
*NL*
insanity
,
more
to
be
cured
by
pity
than
reproof
.
But
since
your
reverend
*NL*
wisdom
hath
discovered
this
Jewish
queen
to
be
a
sorceress
,
perchance
it
*NL*
may
account
fully
for
his
enamoured
folly
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
doth
!

it
doth

Beaumanoir

``
See
,
brother
Conrade

the
peril
*NL*
of
yielding
to

We
look
*NL*
upon

only
to
gratify
the
lust

eye

take
pleasure

complete
,
by

work

was
begun
by
idleness

folly

It
may
be
that
our
brother

Bois-Guilbert
does
in
this
matter
deserve
rather
pity

severe

chastisement

rather

*NL*
*NL*
Albert

bowed
and
retired
,

not

to
seek
out
Brian

communicate
to
him
how

likely

terminate

It
was
not

long
ere
he
found
him
,
foaming
with
indignation
at
a
repulse
he
had
*NL*
anew
sustained
from
the
fair
Jewess
.
``
The
unthinking
,
''
he
said
,
``
the
*NL*
ungrateful

By

Malvoisin

I
abode
until
*NL*
roof
and
rafters
crackled
and
crashed
around
me

I
was
the
butt
of
a
*NL*
hundred
arrows
;
they
rattled
on
mine
armour
like
hailstones
against

a
latticed
casement
,

the
only
use
I
made
of
my
shield
was
for

This
did
I
endure
for
her
;
and
now
the
self-willed
girl
*NL*
upbraids
me
that
I
did
not
leave
her
to
perish
,
and
refuses
me
not
only
*NL*
the

proof
of
gratitude
,

even
the
most
distant
hope
that

ever
she
will
be
brought
to
grant
any

The

that
possessed

*NL*
*NL*

the

I
preached

Malvoisin

Lucas

settled
that

up

down
the
apartment

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``

I

not

I

no

even
to
lose

you

if
you

be

guided

my
counsel

give
up
this

chase

thy

thou
wilt
give
*NL*
Beaumanoir
the
power

expelling
thee

he
will
not

it

He
*NL*
is
jealous

he
holds
in

trembling
gripe

he

ruin
thee

thou
affordest
him
a
pretext
so
fair

thy
protection

*NL*
a
Jewish
sorceress

Give
him
his
scope
in
this
matter

thou
canst
*NL*
not
control
him

When

thou
mayest

to
condemn
this
Rebecca
for
*NL*
sorcery
?
--
Will
not
the
Grand
Master
change
his
mind
when
he
sees
that
*NL*
the
proofs
are
so
weak
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
They
must

replied
Mont-Fitchet
,
``
they
must
be
*NL*
strengthened
.
Dost
thou
understand
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
,
''
said
the
Preceptor
,
``
nor
do
I
scruple
to
do
aught
for
*NL*
advancement
of
the
Order

but
there
is
little
time
to
find
engines
*NL*
fitting

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Malvoisin

said
Conrade
;
``
well
will
it

*NL*
both
the
Order

thee

This
Templestowe

a
poor
Preceptory

that
of

worth
double
its

those
who
can
carry
this
matter
through

thou
art

Preceptor
of
Maison-Dieu
in
the
fertile
Kent

How
sayst
thou
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is

''
replied
Malvoisin
,
``
among
those
who
came
hither
with
*NL*
Bois-Guilbert
,
two
fellows
whom
I
well
know
;
servants
they
were

my
*NL*
brother
Philip
de
Malvoisin
,
and
passed
from
his
service
to
that
of
*NL*
Front-de-Boeuf

It
may
be
they
know
something
of
the
witcheries
of
this
*NL*
woman

*NL*
*NL*
``
Away

seek
them
out
instantly

hark
thee

a
byzant
or
two
will
*NL*
sharpen
their
memory
,
let
them
not
be
wanting

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
would
swear
the
mother
that
bore
them
a
sorceress
for
a
zecchin
,
''
*NL*
said
the
Preceptor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Away
,
then
,
''
said
Mont-Fitchet
;
``
at
noon
the
affair
will
proceed
.
I
*NL*
have
not
seen
our
senior
in
such
earnest
preparation
since
he
condemned
*NL*
to
the
stake
Hamet
Alfagi
,
a
convert
who
relapsed
to
the
Moslem
faith
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
ponderous
castle-bell
had
tolled
the
point
of
noon
,
when
Rebecca
*NL*
heard
a
trampling
of
feet
upon
the
private
stair
which
led
to
her
place
*NL*
of
confinement
.
The
noise
announced
the
arrival
of
several
persons
,
and
*NL*
the
circumstance
rather
gave
her
joy
;
for
she
was
more
afraid
of
the
*NL*
solitary
visits
of
the
fierce
and
passionate
Bois-Guilbert
than
of
*NL*
any
evil
that
could
befall
her
besides
.
The
door
of
the
chamber
was
*NL*
unlocked
,
and
Conrade
and
the
Preceptor
Malvoisin
entered
,
attended
by
*NL*
four
warders
clothed
in
black
,
and
bearing
halberds
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Daughter
of
an
accursed
race
!
''
said
the
Preceptor
,
``
arise
and
follow
*NL*
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whither
,
''
said
Rebecca
,
``
and
for
what
purpose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Damsel
,
''
answered
Conrade
,
``
it
is
not
for
thee
to
question
,
but
to
*NL*
obey
.
Nevertheless
,
be
it
known
to
thee
,
that
thou
art
to
be
brought
*NL*
before
the
tribunal
of
the
Grand
Master
of
our
holy
Order
,
there
to
*NL*
answer
for
thine
offences
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
the
God
of
Abraham
be
praised
!
''
said
Rebecca
,
folding
her
hands
*NL*
devoutly
;
``
the
name
of
a
judge
,
though
an
enemy
to
my
people
,
is
to
me
*NL*
as
the
name
of
a
protector
.
Most
willingly
do
I
follow
thee
--
permit
me
*NL*
only
to
wrap
my
veil
around
my
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
descended
the
stair
with
slow
and
solemn
step
,
traversed
a
long
*NL*
gallery
,
and
,
by
a
pair
of
folding
doors
placed
at
the
end
,
entered
the
*NL*
great
hall
in
which
the
Grand
Master
had
for
the
time
established
his
*NL*
court
of
justice
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lower
part
of
this
ample
apartment
was
filled
with
squires
and
*NL*
yeomen
,
who
made
way
not
without
some
difficulty
for
Rebecca
,
attended
*NL*
by
the
Preceptor
and
Mont-Fitchet
,
and
followed
by
the
guard
of
*NL*
halberdiers
,
to
move
forward
to
the
seat
appointed
for
her
.
As
she
*NL*
passed
through
the
crowd
,
her
arms
folded
and
her
head
depressed
,
a
*NL*
scrap
of
paper
was
thrust
into
her
hand
,
which
she
received
almost
*NL*
unconsciously
,
and
continued
to
hold
without
examining
its
contents
.
The
*NL*
assurance
that
she
possessed
some
friend
in
this
awful
assembly
gave
*NL*
her
courage
to
look
around
,
and
to
mark
into
whose
presence
she
had
*NL*
been
conducted
.
She
gazed
,
accordingly
,
upon
the
scene
,
which
we
shall
*NL*
endeavour
to
describe
in
the
next
chapter
.

CHAPTER
XXXVII
*NL*
*NL*
Stern
was
the
law
which
bade
its
vot
`
ries
leave
*NL*
At
human
woes
with
human
hearts
to
grieve
;
*NL*
Stern
was
the
law
,
which
at
the
winning
wile
*NL*
Of
frank
and
harmless
mirth
forbade
to
smile
;
*NL*
But
sterner
still
,
when
high
the
iron-rod
*NL*
Of
tyrant
power
she
shook
,
and
call
'd
that
power
of
God
.
*NL*
--
The
Middle
Ages
*NL*
*NL*
The
Tribunal
,
erected
for
the
trial
of
the
innocent
and
unhappy
Rebecca
,
*NL*
occupied
the
dais
or
elevated
part
of
the
upper
end
of
the
great
hall
--
a
*NL*
platform
,
which
we
have
already
described
as
the
place
of
honour
,
*NL*
destined
to
be
occupied
by
the
most
distinguished
inhabitants
or
guests
*NL*
of
an
ancient
mansion
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
an
elevated
seat
,
directly
before
the
accused
,
sat
the
Grand
Master
*NL*
of
the
Temple
,
in
full
and
ample
robes
of
flowing
white
,
holding
in
his
*NL*
hand
the
mystic
staff
,
which
bore
the
symbol
of
the
Order
.
At
his
feet
*NL*
was
placed
a
table
,
occupied
by
two
scribes
,
chaplains
of
the
Order
,
*NL*
whose
duty
it
was
to
reduce
to
formal
record
the
proceedings
of
the
day
.
*NL*
The
black
dresses
,
bare
scalps
,
and
demure
looks
of
these
church-men
,
*NL*
formed
a
strong
contrast
to
the
warlike
appearance
of
the
knights
who
*NL*
attended
,
either
as
residing
in
the
Preceptory
,
or
as
come
thither
to
*NL*
attend
upon
their
Grand
Master
.
The
Preceptors
,
of
whom
there
were
four
*NL*
present
,
occupied
seats
lower
in
height
,
and
somewhat
drawn
back
behind
*NL*
that
of
their
superior
;
and
the
knights
,
who
enjoyed
no
such
rank
in
*NL*
the
Order
,
were
placed
on
benches
still
lower
,
and
preserving
the
same
*NL*
distance
from
the
Preceptors
as
these
from
the
Grand
Master
.
Behind
*NL*
them
,
but
still
upon
the
dais
or
elevated
portion
of
the
hall
,
stood
the
*NL*
esquires
of
the
Order
,
in
white
dresses
of
an
inferior
quality
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
assembly
wore
an
aspect
of
the
most
profound
gravity
;
and
in
*NL*
the
faces
of
the
knights
might
be
perceived
traces
of
military
daring
,
*NL*
united
with
the
solemn
carriage
becoming
men
of
a
religious
profession
,
*NL*
and
which
,
in
the
presence
of
their
Grand
Master
,
failed
not
to
sit
upon
*NL*
every
brow
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
remaining
and
lower
part
of
the
hall
was
filled
with
guards
,
holding
*NL*
partisans
,
and
with
other
attendants
whom
curiosity
had
drawn
thither
,
*NL*
to
see
at
once
a
Grand
Master
and
a
Jewish
sorceress
.
By
far
the
greater
*NL*
part
of
those
inferior
persons
were
,
in
one
rank
or
other
,
connected
*NL*
with
the
Order
,
and
were
accordingly
distinguished
by
their
black
*NL*
dresses
.
But
peasants
from
the
neighbouring
country
were
not
refused
*NL*
admittance
;
for
it
was
the
pride
of
Beaumanoir
to
render
the
edifying
*NL*
spectacle
of
the
justice
which
he
administered
as
public
as
possible
.
*NL*
His
large
blue
eyes
seemed
to
expand
as
he
gazed
around
the
assembly
,
*NL*
and
his
countenance
appeared
elated
by
the
conscious
dignity
,
and
*NL*
imaginary
merit
,
of
the
part
which
he
was
about
to
perform
.
A
psalm
,
*NL*
which
he
himself
accompanied
with
a
deep
mellow
voice
,
which
age
had
not
*NL*
deprived
of
its
powers
,
commenced
the
proceedings
of
the
day
;
and
the
*NL*
solemn
sounds
,
``
Venite
exultemus
Domino
''
,
so
often
sung
by
the
Templars
*NL*
before
engaging
with
earthly
adversaries
,
was
judged
by
Lucas
most
*NL*
appropriate
to
introduce
the
approaching
triumph
,
for
such
he
deemed
*NL*
it
,
over
the
powers
of
darkness
.
The
deep
prolonged
notes
,
raised
by
*NL*
a
hundred
masculine
voices
accustomed
to
combine
in
the
choral
chant
,
*NL*
arose
to
the
vaulted
roof
of
the
hall
,
and
rolled
on
amongst
its
arches
*NL*
with
the
pleasing
yet
solemn
sound
of
the
rushing
of
mighty
waters
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
sounds
ceased
,
the
Grand
Master
glanced
his
eye
slowly
around
*NL*
the
circle
,
and
observed
that
the
seat
of
one
of
the
Preceptors
was
*NL*
vacant
.
Brian
de
Bois-Guilbert
,
by
whom
it
had
been
occupied
,
had
left
*NL*
his
place
,
and
was
now
standing
near
the
extreme
corner
of
one
of
the
*NL*
benches
occupied
by
the
Knights
Companions
of
the
Temple
,
one
hand
*NL*
extending
his
long
mantle
,
so
as
in
some
degree
to
hide
his
face
;
*NL*
while
the
other
held
his
cross-handled
sword
,
with
the
point
of
which
,
*NL*
sheathed
as
it
was
,
he
was
slowly
drawing
lines
upon
the
oaken
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Unhappy
man
!
''
said
the
Grand
Master
,
after
favouring
him
with
a
glance
*NL*
of
compassion
.
``
Thou
seest
,
Conrade
,
how
this
holy
work
distresses
him
.
*NL*
To
this
can
the
light
look
of
woman
,
aided
by
the
Prince
of
the
Powers
*NL*
of
this
world
,
bring
a
valiant
and
worthy
knight
!
--
Seest
thou
he
can
not
*NL*
look
upon
us
;
he
can
not
look
upon
her
;
and
who
knows
by
what
impulse
*NL*
from
his
tormentor
his
hand
forms
these
cabalistic
lines
upon
the
*NL*
floor
?
--
It
may
be
our
life
and
safety
are
thus
aimed
at
;
but
we
spit
at
*NL*
and
defy
the
foul
enemy
.
`
Semper
Leo
percutiatur
!
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
communicated
apart
to
his
confidential
follower
,
Conrade
*NL*
Mont-Fitchet
.
The
Grand
Master
then
raised
his
voice
,
and
addressed
the
*NL*
assembly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Reverend
and
valiant
men
,
Knights
,
Preceptors
,
and
Companions
of
this
*NL*
Holy
Order
,
my
brethren
and
my
children
!
--
you
also
,
well-born
and
pious
*NL*
Esquires
,
who
aspire
to
wear
this
holy
Cross
!
--
and
you
also
,
Christian
*NL*
brethren
,
of
every
degree
!
--
Be
it
known
to
you
,
that
it
is
not
defect
of
*NL*
power
in
us
which
hath
occasioned
the
assembling
of
this
congregation
;
*NL*
for
,
however
unworthy
in
our
person
,
yet
to
us
is
committed
,
with
this
*NL*
batoon
,
full
power
to
judge
and
to
try
all
that
regards
the
weal
of
*NL*
this
our
Holy
Order
.
Holy
Saint
Bernard
,
in
the
rule
of
our
knightly
and
*NL*
religious
profession
,
hath
said
,
in
the
fifty-ninth
capital
,
-LSB-
53
-RSB-
that
*NL*
he
would
not
that
brethren
be
called
together
in
council
,
save
at
the
*NL*
will
and
command
of
the
Master
;
leaving
it
free
to
us
,
as
to
those
more
*NL*
worthy
fathers
who
have
preceded
us
in
this
our
office
,
to
judge
,
as
*NL*
well
of
the
occasion
as
of
the
time
and
place
in
which
a
chapter
of
the
*NL*
whole
Order
,
or
of
any
part
thereof
,
may
be
convoked
.
Also
,
in
all
such
*NL*
chapters
,
it
is
our
duty
to
hear
the
advice
of
our
brethren
,
and
to
*NL*
proceed
according
to
our
own
pleasure
.
But
when
the
raging
wolf
hath
*NL*
made
an
inroad
upon
the
flock
,
and
carried
off
one
member
thereof
,
it
is
*NL*
the
duty
of
the
kind
shepherd
to
call
his
comrades
together
,
that
with
*NL*
bows
and
slings
they
may
quell
the
invader
,
according
to
our
well-known
*NL*
rule
,
that
the
lion
is
ever
to
be
beaten
down
.
We
have
therefore
*NL*
summoned
to
our
presence
a
Jewish
woman
,
by
name
Rebecca
,
daughter
*NL*
of
Isaac
of
York
--
a
woman
infamous
for
sortileges
and
for
witcheries
;
*NL*
whereby
she
hath
maddened
the
blood
,
and
besotted
the
brain
,
not
of
a
*NL*
churl
,
but
of
a
Knight
--
not
of
a
secular
Knight
,
but
of
one
devoted
*NL*
to
the
service
of
the
Holy
Temple
--
not
of
a
Knight
Companion
,
but
of
a
*NL*
Preceptor
of
our
Order
,
first
in
honour
as
in
place
.
Our
brother
,
Brian
*NL*
de
Bois-Guilbert
,
is
well
known
to
ourselves
,
and
to
all
degrees
who
now
*NL*
hear
me
,
as
a
true
and
zealous
champion
of
the
Cross
,
by
whose
arm
many
*NL*
deeds
of
valour
have
been
wrought
in
the
Holy
Land
,
and
the
holy
places
*NL*
purified
from
pollution
by
the
blood
of
those
infidels
who
defiled
them
.
*NL*
Neither
have
our
brother
's
sagacity
and
prudence
been
less
in
repute
*NL*
among
his
brethren
than
his
valour
and
discipline
;
in
so
much
,
that
*NL*
knights
,
both
in
eastern
and
western
lands
,
have
named
De
Bois-Guilbert
*NL*
as
one
who
may
well
be
put
in
nomination
as
successor
to
this
batoon
,
*NL*
when
it
shall
please
Heaven
to
release
us
from
the
toil
of
bearing
*NL*
it
.
If
we
were
told
that
such
a
man
,
so
honoured
,
and
so
honourable
,
*NL*
suddenly
casting
away
regard
for
his
character
,
his
vows
,
his
brethren
,
*NL*
and
his
prospects
,
had
associated
to
himself
a
Jewish
damsel
,
wandered
*NL*
in
this
lewd
company
,
through
solitary
places
,
defended
her
person
in
*NL*
preference
to
his
own
,
and
,
finally
,
was
so
utterly
blinded
and
besotted
*NL*
by
his
folly
,
as
to
bring
her
even
to
one
of
our
own
Preceptories
,
*NL*
what
should
we
say
but
that
the
noble
knight
was
possessed
by
some
*NL*
evil
demon
,
or
influenced
by
some
wicked
spell
?
--
If
we
could
suppose
*NL*
it
otherwise
,
think
not
rank
,
valour
,
high
repute
,
or
any
earthly
*NL*
consideration
,
should
prevent
us
from
visiting
him
with

Order

the
soldiers
of

Cross
are
*NL*
brought
into
a
snare

For
which
heinous
and
multiplied
guilt

Brian
de

should
be
cut
off
and
cast
out

our
congregation

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
.
A
low
murmur
went
through
the
assembly
.
Some
of
the
younger
*NL*
part
,
who
had
been
inclined
to
smile
at
the
statute
`
De
osculis
*NL*
fugiendis
'
,
became
now
grave
enough
,
and
anxiously
waited
what
the
Grand
*NL*
Master
was
next
to
propose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Such
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
so
great
should
indeed
be
the
punishment
of
a
*NL*
Knight
Templar
,
who
wilfully
offended
against
the
rules
of
his
Order
in
*NL*
such
weighty
points
.
But
if
,
by
means
of
charms
and
of
spells
,
Satan
had
*NL*
obtained
dominion
over
the
Knight
,
perchance
because
he
cast
his
eyes
*NL*
too
lightly
upon
a
damsel
's
beauty
,
we
are
then
rather
to
lament
than
*NL*
chastise
his
backsliding
;
and
,
imposing
on
him
only
such
penance
as
*NL*
may
purify
him
from
his
iniquity
,
we
are
to
turn
the
full
edge
of
*NL*
our
indignation
upon
the
accursed
instrument
,
which
had
so
well-nigh
*NL*
occasioned
his
utter
falling
away
.
--
Stand
forth
,
therefore
,
and
bear
*NL*
witness
,
ye
who
have
witnessed
these
unhappy
doings
,
that
we
may
judge
*NL*
of
the
sum
and
bearing
thereof
;
and
judge
whether
our
justice
may
be
*NL*
satisfied
with
the
punishment
of
this
infidel
woman
,
or
if
we
must
*NL*
go
on
,
with
a
bleeding
heart
,
to
the
further
proceeding
against
our
*NL*
brother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Several
witnesses
were
called
upon
to
prove
the
risks
to
which
*NL*
Bois-Guilbert
exposed
himself
in
endeavouring
to
save
Rebecca
from
the
*NL*
blazing
castle
,
and
his
neglect
of
his
personal
defence
in
attending
to
*NL*
her
safety
.
The
men
gave
these
details
with
the
exaggerations
common
to
*NL*
vulgar
minds
which
have
been
strongly
excited
by
any
remarkable
event
,
*NL*
and
their
natural
disposition
to
the
marvellous
was
greatly
increased
*NL*
by
the
satisfaction
which
their
evidence
seemed
to
afford
to
the
eminent
*NL*
person
for
whose
information
it
had
been
delivered
.
Thus
the
dangers
*NL*
which
Bois-Guilbert
surmounted
,
in
themselves
sufficiently
great
,
became
*NL*
portentous
in
their
narrative
.
The
devotion
of
the
Knight
to
Rebecca
's
*NL*
defence
was
exaggerated
beyond
the
bounds
,
not
only
of
discretion
,
but
*NL*
even
of
the
most
frantic
excess
of
chivalrous
zeal
;
and
his
deference
*NL*
to
what
she
said
,
even
although
her
language
was
often
severe
and
*NL*
upbraiding
,
was
painted
as
carried
to
an
excess
,
which
,
in
a
man
of
his
*NL*
haughty
temper
,
seemed
almost
preternatural
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Preceptor
of
Templestowe
was
then
called
on
to
describe
the
manner
*NL*
in
which
Bois-Guilbert
and
the
Jewess
arrived
at
the
Preceptory
.
The
*NL*
evidence
of
Malvoisin
was
skilfully
guarded
.
But
while
he
apparently
*NL*
studied
to
spare
the
feelings
of
Bois-Guilbert
,
he
threw
in
,
from
time
*NL*
to
time
,
such
hints
,
as
seemed
to
infer
that
he
laboured
under
some
*NL*
temporary
alienation
of
mind
,
so
deeply
did
he
appear
to
be
enamoured
of
*NL*
the
damsel
whom
he
brought
along
with
him
.
With
sighs
of
penitence
,
the
*NL*
Preceptor
avowed
his
own
contrition
for
having
admitted
Rebecca
and
*NL*
her
lover
within
the
walls
of
the
Preceptory
--
``
But
my
defence
,
''
he
*NL*
concluded
,
``
has
been
made
in
my
confession
to
our
most
reverend
father
*NL*
the
Grand
Master
;
he
knows
my
motives
were
not
evil
,
though
my
conduct
*NL*
may
have
been
irregular
.
Joyfully
will
I
submit
to
any
penance
he
shall
*NL*
assign
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
hast
spoken
well
,
Brother
Albert
,
''
said
Beaumanoir
;
``
thy
motives
*NL*
were
good
,
since
thou
didst
judge
it
right
to
arrest
thine
erring
*NL*
brother
in
his
career
of
precipitate
folly
.
But
thy
conduct
was
wrong
;
*NL*
as
he
that
would
stop
a
runaway
steed
,
and
seizing
by
the
stirrup
*NL*
instead
of
the
bridle
,
receiveth
injury
himself
,
instead
of
*NL*
accomplishing
his
purpose
.
Thirteen
paternosters
are
assigned
by
our
*NL*
pious
founder
for
matins
,
and
nine
for
vespers
;
be
those
services
*NL*
doubled
by
thee
.
Thrice
a-week
are
Templars
permitted
the
use
of
flesh
;
*NL*
but
do
thou
keep
fast
for
all
the
seven
days
.
This
do
for
six
weeks
to
*NL*
come
,
and
thy
penance
is
accomplished

''
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
hypocritical
look
of
the
deepest
submission
,
the
Preceptor
of
*NL*
Templestowe
bowed
to
the
ground
before
his
Superior
,
and
resumed
his
*NL*
seat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Were
it
not
well
,
brethren
,
''
said
the
Grand
Master
,
``
that
we
examine
*NL*
something
into
the
former
life

conversation

this
woman

specially
*NL*
that
we
may
discover
whether
she
be
one
likely
to
use
magical
charms
*NL*
and
spells
,
since
the
truths
which
we
have
heard
may
well
incline
us
to
*NL*
suppose
,
that
in
this
unhappy
course
our
erring
brother
has
been
acted
*NL*
upon
by
some
infernal
enticement

delusion

*NL*
*NL*
Herman
of
Goodalricke
was
the
Fourth
Preceptor
present
;
the
other
*NL*
three
were
Conrade
,
Malvoisin
,
and
Bois-Guilbert
himself
.
Herman
was
an
*NL*
ancient
warrior
,
whose
face
was
marked
with
scars
inflicted
by
the
*NL*
sabre
of
the
Moslemah
,
and
had
great
rank
and
consideration
among
his
*NL*
brethren
.
He
arose
and
bowed
to
the
Grand
Master
,
who
instantly
granted
*NL*
him
license
of
speech
.
``
I
would

*NL*
*NL*
Bois-Guilbert
turned
his
head
towards

thus
*NL*
addressed

remained
silent

*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
Bois-Guilbert
made
an
effort
to
suppress
his
rising
scorn

*NL*
indignation
,
the
expression
of
which
,
he
was
well
aware

would
have

little
availed
him

he
answered
,
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
We
forgive

said
the

A
glance
of

disdain
flashed
from
the
dark
fierce
eyes
of
Bois-Guilbert
,
but
he
made
*NL*
no

pursued
the
Grand

``

There
was
a
bustle
in
the
lower
part
of
the
hall
,
and
when
the
Grand
*NL*
Master
enquired
the
reason
,
it
was
replied
,
there
was
in
the
crowd
a
*NL*
bedridden
man
,
whom
the
prisoner
had
restored
to
the
perfect
use
of
his
*NL*
limbs
,
by
a
miraculous
balsam
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
peasant
,
a
Saxon
by
birth
,
was
dragged
forward
to
the
bar
,
*NL*
terrified
at
the
penal
consequences
which
he
might
have
incurred
by
the
*NL*
guilt
of
having
been
cured
of
the
palsy
by
a
Jewish
damsel
.
Perfectly
*NL*
cured
he
certainly
was
not
,
for
he
supported
himself
forward
on
crutches
*NL*
to
give
evidence
.
Most
unwilling
was
his
testimony
,
and
given
with
many
*NL*
tears
;
but
he
admitted
that
two
years
since
,
when
residing
at
York
,
he
*NL*
was
suddenly
afflicted
with
a
sore
disease
,
while
labouring
for
Isaac
*NL*
the
rich
Jew
,
in
his
vocation
of
a
joiner
;
that
he
had
been
unable
to
*NL*
stir
from
his
bed
until
the
remedies
applied
by
Rebecca
's
directions
,
*NL*
and
especially
a
warming
and
spicy-smelling
balsam
,
had
in
some
degree
*NL*
restored
him
to
the
use
of
his
limbs
.
Moreover
,
he
said
,
she
had
given
*NL*
him
a
pot
of
that
precious
ointment
,
and
furnished
him
with
a
piece
of
*NL*
money
withal
,
to
return
to
the
house
of
his
father
,
near
to
Templestowe
.
*NL*
``
And
may
it
please
your
gracious
Reverence
,
''
said
the
man
,
``
I
can
not
*NL*
think
the
damsel
meant
harm

hath
the
ill
hap

be
a
*NL*
Jewess

for
even
when
I
used

I
said

Creed

it
never
operated
a

kindly

*NL*

The
peasant
,
fumbling
in
his
bosom
with
a
trembling
hand
,
produced
a
*NL*
small
box
,
bearing
some
Hebrew
characters
on
the
lid
,
which
was
,
with
*NL*
most
of
the
audience
,
a
sure
proof
that
the
devil
had
stood
apothecary

*NL*
Beaumanoir
,
after
crossing
himself
,
took
the
box
into
his
hand
,
and
,
*NL*
learned
in
most
of
the
Eastern
tongues
,
read
with
ease
the
motto
on
the
*NL*
lid
,
--
``
The
Lion
of
the
tribe
of
Judah
hath
conquered

*NL*
*NL*
``

powers

said
he
,
``

into

blasphemy

mingling
poison

necessary
food

Is
there
no
leech
*NL*
here
who
can
tell
us
the
ingredients
of

mystic
unguent

*NL*
*NL*
Two
mediciners
,
as
they
called
themselves
,
the
one
a
monk
,
the
other
*NL*
a
barber
,
appeared
,
and
avouched
they
knew
nothing
of
the
materials
,
*NL*
excepting
that
they
savoured
of
myrrh
and
camphire
,
which
they
took
to
*NL*
be
Oriental
herbs
.
But
with
the
true
professional
hatred
to
a
successful
*NL*
practitioner
of
their
art
,
they
insinuated
that
,
since
the
medicine
was
*NL*
beyond
their
own
knowledge
,
it
must
necessarily
have
been
compounded
*NL*
from
an
unlawful
and
magical
pharmacopeia
;
since
they
themselves
,
though
*NL*
no
conjurors
,
fully
understood
every
branch
of
their
art
,
so
far
as
it
*NL*
might
be
exercised
with
the
good
faith
of
a
Christian
.
When
this
medical
*NL*
research
was
ended
,
the
Saxon
peasant
desired
humbly
to
have
back
the
*NL*
medicine
which
he
had
found
so
salutary
;
but
the
Grand
Master
frowned
*NL*
severely
at
the
request
.
``
What
is
thy
name

fellow

''
said
he
to
the
*NL*
cripple
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Higg

answered
the
peasant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then

the

faithful
service
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Out
with
the
prating
villain
!
''
said
Beaumanoir
,
who
was
not
prepared
to
*NL*
refute
this
practical
application
of
his
general
maxim
.
*NL*
*NL*
Higg
,
the
son
of
Snell
,
withdrew
into
the
crowd
,
but
,
interested
in
the
*NL*
fate
of
his
benefactress
,
lingered
until
he
should
learn
her
doom
,
even
*NL*
at
the
risk
of
again
encountering
the
frown
of
that
severe
judge
,
the
*NL*
terror
of
which
withered
his
very
heart
within
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
period
of
the
trial
,
the
Grand
Master
commanded
Rebecca
to
*NL*
unveil
herself
.
Opening
her
lips
for
the
first
time
,
she
replied
*NL*
patiently
,
but
with
dignity
,
--
``
That
it
was
not
the
wont
of
the
daughters
*NL*
of
her
people
to
uncover
their
faces
when
alone
in
an
assembly
of
*NL*
strangers
.
''
The
sweet
tones
of
her
voice
,
and
the
softness
of
her
*NL*
reply
,
impressed
on
the
audience
a
sentiment
of
pity
and
sympathy
.
But
*NL*
Beaumanoir
,
in
whose
mind
the
suppression
of
each
feeling
of
humanity
*NL*
which
could
interfere
with
his
imagined
duty
,
was
a
virtue
of
itself
,
*NL*
repeated
his
commands
that
his
victim
should
be
unveiled
.
The
guards
*NL*
were
about
to
remove
her
veil
accordingly
,
when
she
stood
up
before
*NL*
the
Grand
Master
and
said
,
``
Nay
,
but
for
the
love
of
your
own
*NL*
daughters
--
Alas
,
''
she
said
,
recollecting
herself
,
``
ye
have
no
*NL*
daughters
!
--
yet
for
the
remembrance
of
your
mothers
--
for
the
love
of
*NL*
your
sisters
,
and
of
female
decency
,
let
me
not
be
thus
handled
in
your
*NL*
presence
;
it
suits
not
a
maiden
to
be
disrobed
by
such
rude
grooms
.
I
*NL*
will
obey
you
,
''
she
added
,
with
an
expression
of
patient
sorrow
in
her
*NL*
voice
,
which
had
almost
melted
the
heart
of
Beaumanoir
himself
;
``
ye
are
*NL*
elders
among
your
people
,
and
at
your
command
I
will
show
the
features
*NL*
of
an
ill-fated
maiden
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
withdrew
her
veil
,
and
looked
on
them
with
a
countenance
in
which
*NL*
bashfulness
contended
with
dignity
.
Her
exceeding
beauty
excited
a
*NL*
murmur
of
surprise
,
and
the
younger
knights
told
each
other
with
their
*NL*
eyes
,
in
silent
correspondence
,
that
Brian
's
best
apology
was
in
the
*NL*
power
of
her
real
charms
,
rather
than
of
her
imaginary
witchcraft
.
But
*NL*
Higg
,
the
son
of
Snell
,
felt
most
deeply
the
effect
produced
by
the
*NL*
sight
of
the
countenance
of
his
benefactress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
go
forth
,
''
he
said
to
the
warders
at
the
door
of
the
hall
,
--
``
let
*NL*
me
go
forth
!
--
To
look
at
her
again
will
kill
me
,
for
I
have
had
a
share
*NL*
in
murdering
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Peace
,
poor
man
,
''
said
Rebecca
,
when
she
heard
his
exclamation
;
``
thou
*NL*
hast
done
me
no
harm
by
speaking
the
truth
--
thou
canst
not
aid
me
by
*NL*
thy
complaints
or
lamentations
.
Peace
,
I
pray
thee
--
go
home
and
save
*NL*
thyself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Higg
was
about
to
be
thrust
out
by
the
compassion
of
the
warders
,
*NL*
who
were
apprehensive
lest
his
clamorous
grief
should
draw
upon
them
*NL*
reprehension
,
and
upon
himself
punishment
.
But
he
promised
to
be
silent
,
*NL*
and
was
permitted
to
remain
.
The
two
men-at-arms
,
with
whom
Albert
*NL*
Malvoisin
had
not
failed
to
communicate
upon
the
import
of
their
*NL*
testimony
,
were
now
called
forward
.
Though
both
were
hardened
and
*NL*
inflexible
villains
,
the
sight
of
the
captive
maiden
,
as
well
as
her
*NL*
excelling
beauty
,
at
first
appeared
to
stagger
them
;
but
an
expressive
*NL*
glance
from
the
Preceptor
of
Templestowe
restored
them
to
their
dogged
*NL*
composure
;
and
they
delivered
,
with
a
precision
which
would
have
seemed
*NL*
suspicious
to
more
impartial
judges
,
circumstances
either
altogether
*NL*
fictitious
or
trivial
,
and
natural
in
themselves
,
but
rendered
pregnant
*NL*
with
suspicion
by
the
exaggerated
manner
in
which
they
were
told
,
and
*NL*
the
sinister
commentary
which
the
witnesses
added
to
the
facts
.
The
*NL*
circumstances
of
their
evidence
would
have
been
,
in
modern
days
,
divided
*NL*
into
two
classes
--
those
which
were
immaterial
,
and
those
which
were
*NL*
actually
and
physically
impossible
.
But
both
were
,
in
those
ignorant
*NL*
and
superstitions
times
,
easily
credited
as
proofs
of
guilt
.
--
The
first
*NL*
class
set
forth
,
that
Rebecca
was
heard
to
mutter
to
herself
in
an
*NL*
unknown
tongue
--
that
the
songs
she
sung
by
fits
were
of
a
strangely
*NL*
sweet
sound
,
which
made
the
ears
of
the
hearer
tingle
,
and
his
heart
*NL*
throb
--
that
she
spoke
at
times
to
herself
,
and
seemed
to
look
upward
*NL*
for
a
reply
--
that
her
garments
were
of
a
strange
and
mystic
form
,
*NL*
unlike
those
of
women
of
good
repute
--
that
she
had
rings
impressed
with
*NL*
cabalistical
devices
,
and
that
strange
characters
were
broidered
on
her
*NL*
veil
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
these
circumstances
,
so
natural
and
so
trivial
,
were
gravely
*NL*
listened
to
as
proofs
,
or
,
at
least
,
as
affording
strong
suspicions
that
*NL*
Rebecca
had
unlawful
correspondence
with
mystical
powers
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
was
less
equivocal
testimony
,
which
the
credulity
of
*NL*
the
assembly
,
or
of
the
greater
part
,
greedily
swallowed
,
however
*NL*
incredible
.
One
of
the
soldiers
had
seen
her
work
a
cure
upon
a
wounded
*NL*
man
,
brought
with
them
to
the
castle
of
Torquilstone
.
She
did
,
he
said
,
*NL*
make
certain
signs
upon
the
wound
,
and
repeated
certain
mysterious
*NL*
words
,
which
he
blessed
God
he
understood
not
,
when
the
iron
head
of
a
*NL*
square
cross-bow
bolt
disengaged
itself
from
the
wound
,
the
bleeding
was
*NL*
stanched
,
the
wound
was
closed
,
and
the
dying
man
was
,
within
a
quarter
*NL*
of
an
hour
,
walking
upon
the
ramparts
,
and
assisting
the
witness
in
*NL*
managing
a
mangonel
,
or
machine
for
hurling
stones
.
This
legend
was
*NL*
probably
founded
upon
the
fact
,
that
Rebecca
had
attended
on
the
*NL*
wounded
Ivanhoe
when
in
the
castle
of
Torquilstone
.
But
it
was
the
*NL*
more
difficult
to
dispute
the
accuracy
of
the
witness
,
as
,
in
order
to
*NL*
produce
real
evidence
in
support
of
his
verbal
testimony
,
he
drew
from
*NL*
his
pouch
the
very
bolt-head
,
which
,
according
to
his
story
,
had
been
*NL*
miraculously
extracted
from
the
wound
;
and
as
the
iron
weighed
a
full
*NL*
ounce
,
it
completely
confirmed
the
tale
,
however
marvellous
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
comrade
had
been
a
witness
from
a
neighbouring
battlement
of
the
*NL*
scene
betwixt
Rebecca
and
Bois-Guilbert
,
when
she
was
upon
the
point
of
*NL*
precipitating
herself
from
the
top
of
the
tower
.
Not
to
be
behind
his
*NL*
companion
,
this
fellow
stated
,
that
he
had
seen
Rebecca
perch
herself
*NL*
upon
the
parapet
of
the
turret
,
and
there
take
the
form
of
a
milk-white
*NL*
swan
,
under
which
appearance
she
flitted
three
times
round
the
castle
of
*NL*
Torquilstone
;
then
again
settle
on
the
turret
,
and
once
more
assume
the
*NL*
female
form
.
*NL*
*NL*
Less
than
one
half
of
this
weighty
evidence
would
have
been
sufficient
*NL*
to
convict
any
old
woman
,
poor
and
ugly
,
even
though
she
had
not
been
a
*NL*
Jewess
.
United
with
that
fatal
circumstance
,
the
body
of
proof
was
too
*NL*
weighty
for
Rebecca
's
youth
,
though
combined
with
the
most
exquisite
*NL*
beauty
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Grand
Master
had
collected
the
suffrages
,
and
now
in
a
solemn
*NL*
tone
demanded
of
Rebecca
what
she
had
to
say
against
the
sentence
of
*NL*
condemnation
,
which
he
was
about
to
pronounce
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
invoke
your
pity
,
''
said
the
lovely
Jewess
,
with
a
voice
somewhat
*NL*
tremulous
with
emotion
,
``
would
,
I
am
aware
,
be
as
useless
as
I
should
*NL*
hold
it
mean
.
To
state
that
to
relieve
the
sick
and
wounded
of
another
*NL*
religion
,
can
not
be
displeasing
to
the
acknowledged
Founder
of
both
our
*NL*
faiths
,
were
also
unavailing
;
to
plead
that
many
things
which
these
men
*NL*
-LRB-
whom
may
Heaven
pardon
!
-RRB-
have
spoken
against
me
are
impossible
,
would
*NL*
avail
me
but
little
,
since
you
believe
in
their
possibility
;
and
still
*NL*
less
would
it
advantage
me
to
explain
,
that
the
peculiarities
of
my
*NL*
dress
,
language
,
and
manners
,
are
those
of
my
people
--
I
had
well-nigh
*NL*
said
of
my
country
,
but
alas
!
we
have
no
country
.
Nor
will
I
even
*NL*
vindicate
myself
at
the
expense
of
my
oppressor
,
who
stands
there
*NL*
listening
to
the
fictions
and
surmises
which
seem
to
convert
the
tyrant
*NL*
into
the
victim
.
--
God
be
judge
between
him
and
me
!
but
rather
would
I
*NL*
submit
to
ten
such
deaths
as
your
pleasure
may
denounce
against
me
,
*NL*
than
listen
to
the
suit
which
that
man
of
Belial
has
urged
upon
*NL*
me
--
friendless
,
defenceless
,
and
his
prisoner
.
But
he
is
of
your
own
*NL*
faith
,
and
his
lightest
affirmance
would
weigh
down
the
most
solemn
*NL*
protestations
of
the
distressed
Jewess
.
I
will
not
therefore
return
to
*NL*
himself
the
charge
brought
against
me
--
but
to
himself
--
Yes
,
Brian
de
*NL*
Bois-Guilbert
,
to
thyself
I
appeal
,
whether
these
accusations
are
not
*NL*
false
?
as
monstrous
and
calumnious
as
they
are
deadly
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
pause
;
all
eyes
turned
to
Brain
de
Bois-Guilbert
.
He
was
*NL*
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak
,
''
she
said
,
``
if
thou
art
a
man
--
if
thou
art
a
Christian
,
*NL*
speak
!
--
I
conjure
thee
,
by
the
habit
which
thou
dost
wear
,
by
the
name
*NL*
thou
dost
inherit
--
by
the
knighthood
thou
dost
vaunt
--
by
the
honour
of
*NL*
thy
mother
--
by
the
tomb
and
the
bones
of
thy
father
--
I
conjure
thee
to
*NL*
say
,
are
these
things
true
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Answer
her
,
brother
,
''
said
the
Grand
Master
,
``
if
the
Enemy
with
whom
*NL*
thou
dost
wrestle
will
give
thee
power
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
,
Bois-Guilbert
seemed
agitated
by
contending
passions
,
which
*NL*
almost
convulsed
his
features
,
and
it
was
with
a
constrained
voice
that
*NL*
at
last
he
replied
,
looking
to
Rebecca
,
--
``
The
scroll
!
--
the
scroll
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
''
said
Beaumanoir
,
``
this
is
indeed
testimony
!
The
victim
of
her
*NL*
witcheries
can
only
name
the
fatal
scroll
,
the
spell
inscribed
on
which
*NL*
is
,
doubtless
,
the
cause
of
his
silence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Rebecca
put
another
interpretation
on
the
words
extorted
as
it
were
*NL*
from
Bois-Guilbert
,
and
glancing
her
eye
upon
the
slip
of
parchment
*NL*
which
she
continued
to
hold
in
her
hand
,
she
read
written
thereupon
in
*NL*
the
Arabian
character
,
``
Demand
a
Champion
!
''
The
murmuring
commentary
*NL*
which
ran
through
the
assembly
at
the
strange
reply
of
Bois-Guilbert
,
*NL*
gave
Rebecca
leisure
to
examine
and
instantly
to
destroy
the
scroll
*NL*
unobserved
.
When
the
whisper
had
ceased
,
the
Grand
Master
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rebecca
,
thou
canst
derive
no
benefit
from
the
evidence
of
this
unhappy
*NL*
knight
,
for
whom
,
as
we
well
perceive
,
the
Enemy
is
yet
too
powerful
.
*NL*
Hast
thou
aught
else
to
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
yet
one
chance
of
life
left
to
me
,
''
said
Rebecca
,
``
even
by
*NL*
your
own
fierce
laws
.
Life
has
been
miserable
--
miserable
,
at
least
,
of

late
--
but
I
will
not
cast
away
the
gift
of
God
,
while
he
affords
me
the
*NL*
means
of
defending
it
.
I
deny
this
charge
--
I
maintain
my
innocence
,
and
*NL*
I
declare
the
falsehood
of
this
accusation

I
challenge
the
privilege

``
And
who

replied
the
Grand
Master
,
``
will
lay
lance
in

a
sorceress

said
Rebecca

enough

She
took
her
embroidered
glove
from
her
hand
,
and
flung
it
down
before
*NL*
the
Grand

with
an
air

excited
universal

CHAPTER
XXXVIII
*NL*
*NL*
--
There
I
throw
my
gage
,
*NL*
To
prove
it
on
thee
to
the
extremest
point
*NL*
Of
martial
daring
.
*NL*
--
Richard
II
*NL*
*NL*
Even
Lucas
Beaumanoir
himself
was
affected
by
the
mien
and
appearance
*NL*
of
Rebecca
.
He
was
not
originally
a
cruel
or
even
a
severe
man
;
but
*NL*
with
passions
by
nature
cold
,
and
with
a
high
,
though
mistaken
,
sense
of
*NL*
duty
,
his
heart
had
been
gradually
hardened
by
the
ascetic
life
which
he
*NL*
pursued
,
the
supreme
power
which
he
enjoyed
,
and
the
supposed
necessity
*NL*
of
subduing
infidelity
and
eradicating
heresy
,
which
he
conceived
*NL*
peculiarly
incumbent
on
him
.
His
features
relaxed
in
their
usual
*NL*
severity
as
he
gazed
upon
the
beautiful
creature
before
him
,
alone
,
*NL*
unfriended
,
and
defending
herself
with
so
much
spirit
and
courage
.
He
*NL*
crossed
himself
twice
,
as
doubting
whence
arose
the
unwonted
softening
*NL*
of
a
heart
,

on
such

to

in

the

steel
of

At

he
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

he
said
,

thy

I
rather
judge

it
the
kinder

grieves
that
so
goodly

around
him

the

was
deeply
*NL*
echoed
by
the

*NL*

Beaumanoir

though
a

Jewess

an

she
is

defenceless

*NL*
*NL*
Albert
Malvoisin
,
still
holding
Rebecca

in
his

was
*NL*
speaking
to
Bois-Guilbert
very
earnestly

in

*NL*

Malvoisin
,
slipping
the
*NL*
glove
under
his
own
mantle

``
And
for

*NL*
One
of
the
chaplains
,
who
acted
as
clerks
to
the
chapter
,
immediately
*NL*
engrossed
the
order
in
a
huge
volume

which
contained
the
proceedings

the
Templar
Knights

solemnly
assembled
on
such

when

he
had
finished
writing

read
aloud
the
sentence

Master

which
,
when
translated
from
the
Norman-French
in

it
was
*NL*
couched

was
expressed
as

*NL*

Holy

doth
deny
the

and
*NL*
saith
,
that
the
testimony
delivered
against

this

is
false
,
*NL*
wicked
,
and
disloyal
;

that
by
lawful
`

-RSB-
of
her
body

unable

such
arms

fully
*NL*
appertain

and
that
at
her
peril
and
cost
.
And
therewith
she
proffered
*NL*
her
gage

And
the
gage

been
delivered
to
the
noble

*NL*
Knight
,
Brian
de
Bois-Guilbert
,
of
the
Holy
Order

was
appointed
to
do
this

in

of
his
Order

himself
,
*NL*
as
injured
and
impaired
by
the
practices
of
the
appellant

Wherefore
the
*NL*
most
reverend
Father
and
puissant
Lord
,
Lucas
Marquis
of
Beaumanoir

did
*NL*
allow
of
the
said
challenge

of
the
said

*NL*
*NL*
``
Amen

said
the
Grand
Master
;
and
the
word
was
echoed
by
all
around
.
*NL*
Rebecca
spoke
not
,
but
she
looked
up
to
heaven
,
and
,
folding
her
hands
,
*NL*
remained
for
a
minute
without
change
of
attitude
.
She
then
modestly
*NL*
reminded
the
Grand
Master
,
that
she
ought
to
be
permitted
some
*NL*
opportunity
of
free
communication
with
her
friends
,
for
the
purpose
of
*NL*
making
her
condition
known
to
them
,
and
procuring
,
if
possible
,
some
*NL*
champion
to
fight
in
her
behalf
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
just
and
lawful

said
the
Grand
Master
;
``
choose
what
messenger

thou
shalt
trust

he
shall
have
free
communication
with
thee
in

prison-chamber
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there

said
Rebecca
,
``
any

here

who

either
for
love

do
the
errand
of
a
distressed
being
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
were
silent
;
for
none
thought
it
safe
,
in
the
presence
of
the
Grand
*NL*
Master
,
to
avow
any
interest
in
the
calumniated
prisoner
,
lest
he
*NL*
should
be
suspected
of
leaning
towards
Judaism
.
Not
even
the
prospect
of
*NL*
reward
,
far
less
any
feelings
of
compassion
alone
,
could
surmount
this
*NL*
apprehension
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rebecca
stood
for
a
few
moments
in
indescribable
anxiety
,
and
then
*NL*
exclaimed
,
``
Is
it
really
thus
?

And

in

land

am
I
to
be

deprived

the
poor
chance

safety

remains
to
me

for
want
of
*NL*
an
act
of
charity

would
not
be
refused
to
the
worst
criminal

*NL*
*NL*
Higg
,
the
son
of
Snell
,
at
length
replied
,
``
I
am
but
a
maimed
man

that
I

stir

move

owing

her
charitable
*NL*
assistance

I
will
do
thine
errand

he
added
,
addressing
Rebecca
,
``
as
*NL*
well
as
a
crippled
object
can

happy
were
my
limbs
fleet
enough

repair

mischief
done
by
my
tongue

Alas

when
I
boasted
of
thy

charity

I
little
thought

was
leading
thee
into
danger

*NL*
*NL*
``
God

said
Rebecca
,
``

the
disposer
of
all

He

turn

To
execute
his

snail
is
as

*NL*
*NL*
The
peasant
took
the
scroll
,
which
contained
only
a
few
lines
in
Hebrew
.
*NL*
Many
of
the
crowd
would
have
dissuaded
him
from
touching
a
document
so
*NL*
suspicious
;
but
Higg
was
resolute
in
the
service
of
his
benefactress
.
*NL*
She
had
saved
his
body
,
he
said
,
and
he
was
confident
she
did
not
mean
*NL*
to
peril
his
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
get
me

he
said
,
``
my
neighbour
Buthan

good
capul

within
as
brief
space
as

*NL*
*NL*
But
as
it
fortuned
,
he
had
no
occasion
to
go
so
far
,
for
within
a
*NL*
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
gate
of
the
Preceptory
he
met
with
two
*NL*
riders
,
whom
,
by
their
dress
and
their
huge
yellow
caps
,
he
knew
to
be
*NL*
Jews
;
and
,
on
approaching
more
nearly
,
discovered
that
one
of
them
was
*NL*
his
ancient
employer
,
Isaac
of
York
.
The
other
was
the
Rabbi
Ben
Samuel
;
*NL*
and
both
had
approached
as
near
to
the
Preceptory
as
they
dared
,
on
*NL*
hearing
that
the
Grand
Master
had
summoned
a
chapter
for
the
trial
of
a
*NL*
sorceress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brother
Ben
Samuel
,
''
said
Isaac
,
``
my
soul
is
disquieted
,
and
I
wot
not
*NL*
why
.
This
charge
of
necromancy
is
right
often
used
for
cloaking
evil
*NL*
practices
on
our
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
of
good
comfort
,
brother
,
''
said
the
physician
;
``
thou
canst
deal
with
*NL*
the
Nazarenes
as
one
possessing
the
mammon
of
unrighteousness
,
and
canst
*NL*
therefore
purchase
immunity
at
their
hands
--
it
rules
the
savage
minds
of
*NL*
those
ungodly
men
,
even
as
the
signet
of
the
mighty
Solomon
was
said
*NL*
to
command
the
evil
genii
.
--
But
what
poor
wretch
comes
hither
upon
his
*NL*
crutches
,
desiring
,
as
I
think
,
some
speech
of
me
?
--
Friend
,
''
continued
*NL*
the
physician
,
addressing
Higg
,
the
son
of
Snell
,
``
I
refuse
thee
not
the
*NL*
aid
of
mine
art
,
but
I
relieve
not
with
one
asper
those
who
beg
for
alms
*NL*
upon
the
highway
.
Out
upon
thee
!
--
Hast
thou
the
palsy
in
thy
legs
?
then
*NL*
let
thy
hands
work
for
thy
livelihood
;
for
,
albeit
thou
be
`
st
unfit
for
*NL*
a
speedy
post
,
or
for
a
careful
shepherd
,
or
for
the
warfare
,
or
for
the
*NL*
service
of
a
hasty
master
,
yet
there
be
occupations
--
How
now
,
brother
?
''
*NL*
said
he
,
interrupting
his
harangue
to
look
towards
Isaac
,
who
had
but
*NL*
glanced
at
the
scroll
which
Higg
offered
,
when
,
uttering
a
deep
groan
,
*NL*
he
fell
from
his
mule
like
a
dying
man
,
and
lay
for
a
minute
insensible
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Rabbi
now
dismounted
in
great
alarm
,
and
hastily
applied
the
*NL*
remedies
which
his
art
suggested
for
the
recovery
of
his
companion
.
He
*NL*
had
even
taken
from
his
pocket
a
cupping
apparatus
,
and
was
about
*NL*
to
proceed
to
phlebotomy
,
when
the
object
of
his
anxious
solicitude
*NL*
suddenly
revived
;
but
it
was
to
dash
his
cap
from
his
head
,
and
to
throw
*NL*
dust
on
his
grey
hairs
.
The
physician
was
at
first
inclined
to
ascribe
*NL*
this
sudden
and
violent
emotion
to
the
effects
of
insanity
;
and
,
*NL*
adhering
to
his
original
purpose
,
began
once
again
to
handle
his
*NL*
implements
.
But
Isaac
soon
convinced
him
of
his
error
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Child
of
my
sorrow
,
''
he
said
,
``
well
shouldst
thou
be
called
Benoni
,
*NL*
instead
of
Rebecca
!
Why
should
thy
death
bring
down
my
grey
hairs
to
the
*NL*
grave
,
till
,
in
the
bitterness
of
my
heart
,
I
curse
God
and
die
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brother
,
''
said
the
Rabbi
,
in
great
surprise
,
``
art
thou
a
father
in
*NL*
Israel
,
and
dost
thou
utter
words
like
unto
these
?
--
I
trust
that
the
*NL*
child
of
thy
house
yet
liveth
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
liveth
,
''
answered
Isaac
;
``
but
it
is
as
Daniel
,
who
was
called
*NL*
Beltheshazzar
,
even
when
within
the
den
of
the
lions
.
She
is
captive
*NL*
unto
those
men
of
Belial
,
and
they
will
wreak
their
cruelty
upon
her
,
*NL*
sparing
neither
for
her
youth
nor
her
comely
favour
.
O
!
she
was
as
a
*NL*
crown
of
green
palms
to
my
grey
locks
;
and
she
must
wither
in
a
night
,
*NL*
like
the
gourd
of
Jonah
!
--
Child
of
my
love
!
--
child
of
my
old
age
!
--
oh
,
*NL*
Rebecca
,
daughter
of
Rachel
!
the
darkness
of
the
shadow
of
death
hath
*NL*
encompassed
thee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
read
the
scroll
,
''
said
the
Rabbi
;
``
peradventure
it
may
be
that
we
*NL*
may
yet
find
out
a
way
of
deliverance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
thou
read
,
brother
,
''
answered
Isaac
,
``
for
mine
eyes
are
as
a
*NL*
fountain
of
water
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
physician
read
,
but
in
their
native
language
,
the
following
words
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
Isaac
,
the
son
of
Adonikam
,
whom
the
Gentiles
call
Isaac
of
York
,
*NL*
peace
and
the
blessing
of
the
promise
be
multiplied
unto
thee
!
--
My
*NL*
father
,
I
am
as
one
doomed
to
die
for
that
which
my
soul
knoweth
*NL*
not
--
even
for
the
crime
of
witchcraft
.
My
father
,
if
a
strong
man
can
be
*NL*
found
to
do
battle
for
my
cause
with
sword
and
spear
,
according
to
the
*NL*
custom
of
the
Nazarenes
,
and
that
within
the
lists
of
Templestowe
,
on
*NL*
the
third
day
from
this
time
,
peradventure
our
fathers
'
God
will
give
*NL*
him
strength
to
defend
the
innocent
,
and
her
who
hath
none
to
help
her
.
*NL*
But
if
this
may
not
be
,
let
the
virgins
of
our
people
mourn
for
me
as
*NL*
for
one
cast
off
,
and
for
the
hart
that
is
stricken
by
the
hunter
,
and
*NL*
for
the
flower
which
is
cut
down
by
the
scythe
of
the
mower
.
Wherefore
*NL*
look
now
what
thou
doest
,
and
whether
there
be
any
rescue
.
One
Nazarene
*NL*
warrior
might
indeed
bear
arms
in
my
behalf
,
even
Wilfred
,
son
of
*NL*
Cedric
,
whom
the
Gentiles
call
Ivanhoe
.
But
he
may
not
yet
endure
*NL*
the
weight
of
his
armour
.
Nevertheless
,
send
the
tidings
unto
him
,
my
*NL*
father
;
for
he
hath
favour
among
the
strong
men
of
his
people
,
and
as
*NL*
he
was
our
companion
in
the
house
of
bondage
,
he
may
find
some
one
to
do
*NL*
battle
for
my
sake
.
And
say
unto
him
,
even
unto
him
,
even
unto
Wilfred
,
*NL*
the
son
of
Cedric
,
that
if
Rebecca
live
,
or
if
Rebecca
die
,
she
liveth
*NL*
or
dieth
wholly
free
of
the
guilt
she
is
charged
withal
.
And
if
it
be
*NL*
the
will
of
God
that
thou
shalt
be
deprived
of
thy
daughter
,
do
not
*NL*
thou
tarry
,
old
man
,
in
this
land
of
bloodshed
and
cruelty
;
but
betake
*NL*
thyself
to
Cordova
,
where
thy
brother
liveth
in
safety
,
under
the
shadow
*NL*
of
the
throne
,
even
of
the
throne
of
Boabdil
the
Saracen
;
for
less
*NL*
cruel
are
the
cruelties
of
the
Moors
unto
the
race
of
Jacob
,
than
the
*NL*
cruelties
of
the
Nazarenes
of
England
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isaac
listened
with
tolerable
composure
while
Ben
Samuel
read
the
*NL*
letter
,
and
then
again
resumed
the
gestures
and
exclamations
of
Oriental
*NL*
sorrow
,
tearing
his
garments
,
besprinkling
his
head
with
dust
,
and
*NL*
ejaculating
,
``
My
daughter

my
daughter

flesh
of
my
flesh
,
and
bone
of
*NL*
my
bone
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
,
''
said
the
Rabbi
,
``
take
courage

nothing

Gird
up
thy

It
may
*NL*
be

help
thee

counsel

favour

constant
in

be
that

may
obtain
his

commanding
these

who
take

dishonour
thereof

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
seek
him
out

Isaac
,
``

compassion

bear
his
armour

*NL*
what
other
Christian
shall
do
battle
for
the
oppressed
of
Zion

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay

said
the
Rabbi
,
``
thou
speakest
as

With

Be
of

also
up

assembled

doubt
not
I

find
among

some

will
do
battle

gold
is

said
Isaac

up

their
full
demand

at

find
it
the
quality

accursed
people

will
ask

They
embraced
accordingly

departed
on
their
several
roads

The
*NL*
crippled
peasant
remained
for
some
time
looking
after

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``

the

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay

replied
the

the

is
easily
received

A
thrust

stroke

me

To
you

this

not

a
parting

Thy

up

again

continued

again
traversing

With

haughty
Richard
hear

well-nigh

Bois-Guilbert
;

I

*NL*
He
left
the
apartment
hastily
as
he
uttered
these
words
,
and
the
*NL*
Preceptor
followed
,
to
watch
and
confirm
him
in
his
resolution
;
for
in
*NL*
Bois-Guilbert
's
fame
he
had
himself
a
strong
interest
,
expecting
much
*NL*
advantage
from
his
being
one
day
at
the
head
of
the
Order
,
not
to
*NL*
mention
the
preferment
of
which
Mont-Fitchet
had
given
him
hopes
,
on

condition

would
forward
the
condemnation
of
the
unfortunate
Rebecca
.
*NL*
Yet
although
,
in
combating
his
friend

better
feelings
,
he
possessed
*NL*
all
the
advantage
which
a
wily
,
composed
,
selfish
disposition
has
over
*NL*
a
man
agitated
by
strong
and
contending
passions
,
it
required
all
*NL*
Malvoisin
's
art
to
keep
Bois-Guilbert
steady
to
the
purpose
he
had
*NL*
prevailed
on
him
to
adopt
.
He
was
obliged
to
watch
him
closely
*NL*
to
prevent
his
resuming
his
purpose
of
flight
,
to
intercept
his
*NL*
communication
with
the
Grand
Master
,
lest
he
should
come
to
an
open
*NL*
rupture
with
his
Superior
,
and
to
renew
,
from
time
to
time
,
the
various
*NL*
arguments
by
which
he
endeavoured
to
show
,
that
,
in
appearing
as
*NL*
champion
on
this
occasion
,
Bois-Guilbert
,
without
either
accelerating
or
*NL*
ensuring
the
fate
of
Rebecca
,
would
follow
the
only
course
by

CHAPTER
XL
*NL*
*NL*
Shadows
avaunt
!
--
Richard
's
himself
again
.
*NL*
Richard
III
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
Black
Knight
--
for
it
becomes
necessary
to
resume
the
train
of
*NL*
his
adventures
--
left
the
Trysting-tree
of
the
generous
Outlaw
,
he
held
*NL*
his
way
straight
to
a
neighbouring
religious
house
,
of
small
extent
*NL*
and
revenue
,
called
the
Priory
of
Saint
Botolph
,
to
which
the
wounded
*NL*
Ivanhoe
had
been
removed
when
the
castle
was
taken
,
under
the
guidance
*NL*
of
the
faithful
Gurth
,
and
the
magnanimous
Wamba
.
It
is
unnecessary
at
*NL*
present
to
mention
what
took
place
in
the
interim
betwixt
Wilfred
*NL*
and
his
deliverer
;
suffice
it
to
say
,
that
after
long
and
grave
*NL*
communication
,
messengers
were
dispatched
by
the
Prior
in
several
*NL*
directions
,
and
that
on
the
succeeding
morning
the
Black
Knight
was
*NL*
about
to
set
forth
on
his
journey
,
accompanied
by
the
jester
Wamba
,
who
*NL*
attended
as
his
guide
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
will
meet
,
''
he
said
to
Ivanhoe
,
``
at
Coningsburgh
,
the
castle
of
the
*NL*
deceased
Athelstane
,
since
there
thy
father
Cedric
holds
the
funeral
*NL*
feast
for
his
noble
relation
.
I
would
see
your
Saxon
kindred
together
,
*NL*
Sir
Wilfred
,
and
become
better
acquainted
with
them
than
heretofore
.
*NL*
Thou
also
wilt
meet
me
;
and
it
shall
be
my
task
to
reconcile
thee
to
thy
*NL*
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
he
took
an
affectionate
farewell
of
Ivanhoe
,
who
expressed
an
*NL*
anxious
desire
to
attend
upon
his
deliverer
.
But
the
Black
Knight
would
*NL*
not
listen
to
the
proposal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rest
this
day
;
thou
wilt
have
scarce
strength
enough
to
travel
on
the
*NL*
next
.
I
will
have
no
guide
with
me
but
honest
Wamba
,
who
can
play
priest
*NL*
or
fool
as
I
shall
be
most
in
the
humour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
,
''
said
Wamba
,
``
will
attend
you
with
all
my
heart
.
I
would
fain
*NL*
see
the
feasting
at
the
funeral
of
Athelstane
;
for
,
if
it
be
not
full
*NL*
and
frequent
,
he
will
rise
from
the
dead
to
rebuke
cook
,
sewer
,
and
*NL*
cupbearer
;
and
that
were
a
sight
worth
seeing
.
Always
,
Sir
Knight
,
I
*NL*
will
trust
your
valour
with
making
my
excuse
to
my
master
Cedric
,
in
*NL*
case
mine
own
wit
should
fail
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
should
my
poor
valour
succeed
,
Sir
Jester
,
when
thy
light
wit
*NL*
halts
?
--
resolve
me
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wit
,
Sir
Knight
,
''
replied
the
Jester
,
``
may
do
much
.
He
is
a
quick
,
*NL*
apprehensive
knave
,
who
sees
his
neighbours
blind
side
,
and
knows
how
*NL*
to
keep
the
lee-gage
when
his
passions
are
blowing
high
.
But
valour
is
a
*NL*
sturdy
fellow
,
that
makes
all
split
.
He
rows
against
both
wind
and
tide
,
*NL*
and
makes
way
notwithstanding
;
and
,
therefore
,
good
Sir
Knight
,
while
I
*NL*
take
advantage
of
the
fair
weather
in
our
noble
master
's
temper
,
I
will
*NL*
expect
you
to
bestir
yourself
when
it
grows
rough

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
Knight
of
the
Fetterlock
,
since
it
is
your
pleasure
so
to
be
*NL*
distinguished
,
''
said
Ivanhoe
,
``
I
fear
me
you
have
chosen
a
talkative
and
*NL*
a
troublesome
fool
to
be
your
guide
.
But
he
knows
every
path
and
alley
*NL*
in
the
woods
as
well
as
e'er
a
hunter
who
frequents
them
;
and
the
poor
*NL*
knave
,
as
thou
hast
partly
seen
,
is
as
faithful
as
steel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
''
said
the
Knight
,
``
an
he
have
the
gift
of
showing
my
road
,
I
shall
*NL*
not
grumble
with
him
that
he
desires
to
make
it
pleasant
.
--
Fare
*NL*
thee
well
,
kind
Wilfred
--
I
charge
thee
not
to
attempt
to
travel
till
*NL*
to-morrow
at

''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
he
extended
his
hand
to
Ivanhoe
,
who
pressed
it
to
his
lips
,
*NL*
took
leave
of
the
Prior
,
mounted
his
horse
,
and
departed
,
with
Wamba
for
*NL*
his
companion
.
Ivanhoe
followed
them
with
his
eyes
,
until
they
were
*NL*
lost
in
the
shades
of
the
surrounding
forest
,
and
then
returned
into
the
*NL*
convent
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
shortly
after
matin-song
,
he
requested
to
see
the
Prior
.
The
old
man
*NL*
came
in
haste
,
and
enquired
anxiously
after
the
state
of
his
health
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
better
,
''
he
said
,
``
than
my
fondest
hope
could
have
anticipated
;
*NL*
either
my
wound
has
been
slighter
than
the
effusion
of
blood
led
me
to
*NL*
suppose
,
or
this
balsam
hath
wrought
a
wonderful
cure
upon
it
.
I
feel
*NL*
already
as
if
I
could
bear
my
corslet
;
and
so
much
the
better
,
for
*NL*
thoughts
pass
in
my
mind
which
render
me
unwilling
to
remain
here
longer
*NL*
in
inactivity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
the
saints
forbid
,
''
said
the
Prior
,
``
that
the
son
of
the
Saxon
*NL*
Cedric
should
leave
our
convent
ere
his
wounds
were
healed
!
It
were
*NL*
shame
to
our
profession
were
we
to
suffer
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
would
I
desire
to
leave
your
hospitable
roof

father

*NL*
said
Ivanhoe
,
``
did
I
not
feel
myself
able
to
endure
the
journey
,
and
*NL*
compelled
to
undertake
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
can
have
urged
you
to
so
sudden
a
departure
?
''
said
the
Prior
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
never
,

father

''
answered
the
Knight
,
``
felt
an
*NL*
apprehension

approaching
evil

you
in
vain
attempted

Have
you
never
found
your

darkened

like
the
sunny
*NL*
landscape

by
the
sudden
cloud

which
augurs
a
coming
tempest
?
--
And
*NL*
thinkest
thou
not
that
such
impulses
are
deserving
of
attention

as
*NL*
being
the
hints

guardian
spirits
,
that
danger
is
impending
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
may
not
deny
,

said
the
Prior
,
crossing
himself
,
``
that
such
things
*NL*
have
been
,
and
have
been
of
Heaven
;
but
then
such
communications
have
*NL*
had
a
visibly
useful
scope
and
tendency
.
But
thou

wounded
as
thou
art
,
*NL*
what
avails
it
thou
shouldst
follow
the
steps
of
him
whom
thou

to
be
assaulted

*NL*
*NL*
``
Prior

said
Ivanhoe
,
``
thou
dost
mistake

I
am
stout
enough
to

buffets

But
were

otherwise
,
may
I
not
aid
him

he
in
danger

by
other
means

force
of

It
is
but
too
well
known
that
the
Saxons
love
not
the

Norman
race

who
knows

the

heels
were
now
*NL*
armed
,
began
to
make
the
worthy
Prior
repent
of
his
courtesy
,
and
*NL*
ejaculate
,
--
``
Nay
,
but
fair
sir
,
now
I
bethink
me
,
my
Malkin
abideth
not
*NL*
the
spur
--
Better
it
were
that
you
tarry
for
the
mare
of
our
manciple
*NL*
down
at
the
Grange
,
which
may
be
had
in
little
more
than
an
hour
,
and
*NL*
can
not
but
be
tractable
,
in
respect
that
she
draweth
much
of
our
winter
*NL*
fire-wood
,
and
eateth
no
corn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thank
you
,
reverend
father
,
but
will
abide
by
your
first
offer
,
as
*NL*
I
see
Malkin
is
already
led
forth
to
the
gate
.
Gurth
shall
carry
mine
*NL*
armour
;
and
for
the
rest
,
rely
on
it
,
that
as
I
will
not
overload
*NL*
Malkin
's
back
,
she
shall
not
overcome
my
patience
.
And
now
,
farewell
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ivanhoe
now
descended
the
stairs
more
hastily
and
easily
than
his
*NL*
wound
promised
,
and
threw
himself
upon
the
jennet
,
eager
to
escape
the
*NL*
importunity
of
the
Prior
,
who
stuck
as
closely
to
his
side
as
his
*NL*
age
and
fatness
would
permit
,
now
singing
the
praises
of
Malkin
,
now
*NL*
recommending
caution
to
the
Knight
in
managing
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
at
the
most
dangerous
period
for
maidens
as
well
as
mares
,
''
said
*NL*
the
old
man
,
laughing
at
his
own
jest
,
``
being
barely
in
her
fifteenth
*NL*
year
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ivanhoe
,
who
had
other
web
to
weave
than
to
stand
canvassing
a
palfrey
's
*NL*
paces
with
its
owner
,
lent
but
a
deaf
ear
to
the
Prior
's
grave
advices
*NL*
and
facetious
jests
,
and
having
leapt
on
his
mare
,
and
commanded
his
*NL*
squire
-LRB-
for
such
Gurth
now
called
himself
-RRB-
to
keep
close
by
his
side
,
he
*NL*
followed
the
track
of
the
Black
Knight
into
the
forest
,
while
the
*NL*
Prior
stood
at
the
gate
of
the
convent
looking
after
him
,
and
*NL*
ejaculating
,
--
``
Saint
Mary
!
how
prompt
and
fiery
be
these
men
of
war
!
*NL*
I
would
I
had
not
trusted
Malkin
to
his
keeping
,
for
,
crippled
as
I
*NL*
am
with
the
cold
rheum
,
I
am
undone
if
aught
but
good
befalls
her
.
And
*NL*
yet
,
''
said
he
,
recollecting
himself
,
``
as
I
would
not
spare
my
own
old
*NL*
and
disabled
limbs
in
the
good
cause
of
Old
England
,
so
Malkin
must
e
`
en
*NL*
run
her
hazard
on
the
same
venture
;
and
it
may
be
they
will
think
our
*NL*
poor
house
worthy
of
some
munificent
guerdon
--
or
,
it
may
be
,
they
will
*NL*
send
the
old
Prior
a
pacing
nag
.
And
if
they
do
none
of
these
,
as
great
*NL*
men
will
forget
little
men
's
service
,
truly
I
shall
hold
me
well
repaid
*NL*
in
having
done
that
which
is
right
.
And
it
is
now
well-nigh
the
fitting
*NL*
time
to
summon
the
brethren
to
breakfast
in
the
refectory
--
Ah
!
I
doubt
*NL*
they
obey
that
call
more
cheerily
than
the
bells
for
primes
and
matins
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
Prior
of
Saint
Botolph
's
hobbled
back
again
into
the
refectory
,
*NL*
to
preside
over
the
stockfish
and
ale
,
which
was
just
serving
out
for
*NL*
the
friars
'
breakfast
.
Busy
and
important
,
he
sat
him
down
at
the
table
,
*NL*
and
many
a
dark
word
he
threw
out
,
of
benefits
to
be
expected
to
the
*NL*
convent
,
and
high
deeds
of
service
done
by
himself
,
which
,
at
another
*NL*
season
,
would
have
attracted
observation
.
But
as
the
stockfish
was
*NL*
highly
salted
,
and
the
ale
reasonably
powerful
,
the
jaws
of
the
brethren
*NL*
were
too
anxiously
employed
to
admit
of
their
making
much
use
of
their
*NL*
ears
;
nor
do
we
read
of
any
of
the
fraternity
,
who
was
tempted
to
*NL*
speculate
upon
the
mysterious
hints
of
their
Superior
,
except
Father
*NL*
Diggory
,
who
was
severely
afflicted
by
the
toothache
,
so
that
he
could
*NL*
only
eat
on
one
side
of
his
jaws
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
the
Black
Champion
and
his
guide
were
pacing
at
their
*NL*
leisure
through
the
recesses
of
the
forest
;
the
good
Knight
whiles
*NL*
humming
to
himself
the
lay
of
some
enamoured
troubadour
,
sometimes
*NL*
encouraging
by
questions
the
prating
disposition
of
his
attendant
,
so
*NL*
that
their
dialogue
formed
a
whimsical
mixture
of
song
and
jest
,
of
*NL*
which
we
would
fain
give
our
readers
some
idea
.
You
are
then
to
imagine
*NL*
this
Knight
,
such
as
we
have
already
described
him
,
strong
of
person
,
*NL*
tall
,
broad-shouldered
,
and
large
of
bone
,
mounted
on
his
mighty
black
*NL*
charger
,
which
seemed
made
on
purpose
to
bear
his
weight
,
so
easily
he
*NL*
paced
forward
under
it
,
having
the
visor
of
his
helmet
raised
,
in
order
*NL*
to
admit
freedom
of
breath
,
yet
keeping
the
beaver
,
or
under
part
,
*NL*
closed
,
so
that
his
features
could
be
but
imperfectly
distinguished
.
But
*NL*
his
ruddy
embrowned
cheek-bones
could
be
plainly
seen
,
and
the
large
and
*NL*
bright
blue
eyes
,
that
flashed
from
under
the
dark
shade
of
the
raised
*NL*
visor
;
and
the
whole
gesture
and
look
of
the
champion
expressed
careless
*NL*
gaiety
and
fearless
confidence
--
a
mind
which
was
unapt
to
apprehend
*NL*
danger
,
and
prompt
to
defy
it
when
most
imminent
--
yet
with
whom
danger
*NL*
was
a
familiar
thought
,
as
with
one
whose
trade
was
war
and
adventure
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Jester
wore
his
usual
fantastic
habit
,
but
late
accidents
had
led
*NL*
him
to
adopt
a
good
cutting
falchion
,
instead
of
his
wooden
sword
,
with
*NL*
a
targe
to
match
it
;
of
both
which
weapons
he
had
,
notwithstanding
*NL*
his
profession
,
shown
himself
a
skilful
master
during
the
storming
of
*NL*
Torquilstone
.
Indeed
,
the
infirmity
of
Wamba
's
brain
consisted
chiefly
*NL*
in
a
kind
of
impatient
irritability
,
which
suffered
him
not
long
to
*NL*
remain
quiet
in
any
posture
,
or
adhere
to
any
certain
train
of
ideas
,
*NL*
although
he
was
for
a
few
minutes
alert
enough
in
performing
any
*NL*
immediate
task
,
or
in
apprehending
any
immediate
topic
.
On
horseback
,
*NL*
therefore
,
he
was
perpetually
swinging
himself
backwards
and
forwards
,
*NL*
now
on
the
horse
's
ears
,
then
anon
on
the
very
rump
of
the
animal
,
--
now
*NL*
hanging
both
his
legs
on
one
side
,
and
now
sitting
with
his
face
to
the
*NL*
tail
,
moping
,
mowing
,
and
making
a
thousand
apish
gestures
,
until
his
*NL*
palfrey
took
his
freaks
so
much
to
heart
,
as
fairly
to
lay
him
at
his
*NL*
length
on
the
green
grass
--
an
incident
which
greatly
amused
the
Knight
,
*NL*
but
compelled
his
companion
to
ride
more
steadily
thereafter
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
point
of
their
journey
at
which
we
take
them
up
,
this
joyous
pair
*NL*
were
engaged
in
singing
a
virelai
,
as
it
was
called
,
in
which
the
clown
*NL*
bore
a
mellow
burden
,
to
the
better
instructed
Knight
of
the
Fetterlock
.
*NL*
And
thus
run
the
ditty
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
Anna-Marie
,
love
,
up
is
the
sun
,
*NL*
Anna-Marie
,
love
,
morn
is
begun
,
*NL*
Mists
are
dispersing
,
love
,
birds
singing
free
,
*NL*
Up
in
the
morning
,
love
,
Anna-Marie
.
*NL*
Anna-Marie
,
love
,
up
in
the
morn
,
*NL*
The
hunter
is
winding
blithe
sounds
on
his
horn
,
*NL*
The
echo
rings
merry
from
rock
and
from
tree
,
*NL*
'T
is
time
to
arouse
thee
,
love
,
Anna-Marie
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wamba
.
*NL*
*NL*
O
Tybalt
,
love
,
Tybalt
,
awake
me
not
yet
,
*NL*
Around
my
soft
pillow
while
softer
dreams
flit
,
*NL*
For
what
are
the
joys
that
in
waking
we
prove
,
*NL*
Compared
with
these
visions
,
O
,
Tybalt
,
my
love
?
*NL*
Let
the
birds
to
the
rise
of
the
mist
carol
shrill
,
*NL*
Let
the
hunter
blow
out
his
loud
horn
on
the
hill
,
*NL*
Softer
sounds
,
softer
pleasures
,
in
slumber
I
prove
,
--
*NL*
But
think
not
I
dreamt
of
thee
,
Tybalt
,
my
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
dainty
song
,
''
said
Wamba
,
when
they
had
finished
their
carol
,
``
and
I
*NL*
swear
by
my
bauble
,
a
pretty
moral
!
--
I
used
to
sing
it
with
Gurth
,
once
*NL*
my
playfellow
,
and
now
,
by
the
grace
of
God
and
his
master
,
no
less
than
*NL*
a
freemen
;
and
we
once
came
by
the
cudgel
for
being
so
entranced
by
the
*NL*
melody
,
that
we
lay
in
bed
two
hours
after
sunrise
,
singing
the
ditty
*NL*
betwixt
sleeping
and
waking
--
my
bones
ache
at
thinking
of
the
tune
ever
*NL*
since
.
Nevertheless
,
I
have
played
the
part
of
Anna-Marie
,
to
please
*NL*
you
,
fair
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Jester
next
struck
into
another
carol
,
a
sort
of
comic
ditty
,
to
*NL*
which
the
Knight
,
catching
up
the
tune
,
replied
in
the
like
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Knight
and
Wamba
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
came
three
merry
men
from
south
,
west
,
and
north
,
*NL*
Ever
more
sing
the
roundelay
;
*NL*
To
win
the
Widow
of
Wycombe
forth
,
*NL*
And
where
was
the
widow
might
say
them
nay
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
was
a
knight
,
and
from
Tynedale
he
came
,
*NL*
Ever
more
sing
the
roundelay
;
*NL*
And
his
fathers
,
God
save
us
,
were
men
of
great
fame
,
*NL*
And
where
was
the
widow
might
say
him
nay
?
*NL*
*NL*
Of
his
father
the
laird
,
of
his
uncle
the
squire
,
*NL*
He
boasted
in
rhyme
and
in
roundelay
;
*NL*
She
bade
him
go
bask
by
his
sea-coal
fire
,
*NL*
For
she
was
the
widow
would
say
him
nay
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wamba
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
that
came
forth
,
swore
by
blood
and
by
nails
,
*NL*
Merrily
sing
the
roundelay
;
*NL*
Hur
's
a
gentleman
,
God
wot
,
and
hur
's
lineage
was
of
Wales
,
*NL*
And
where
was
the
widow
might
say
him
nay
?
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
David
ap
Morgan
ap
Griffith
ap
Hugh
*NL*
Ap
Tudor
ap
Rhice
,
quoth
his
roundelay
*NL*
She
said
that
one
widow
for
so
many
was
too
few
,
*NL*
And
she
bade
the
Welshman
wend
his
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
then
next
came
a
yeoman
,
a
yeoman
of
Kent
,
*NL*
Jollily
singing
his
roundelay
;
*NL*
He
spoke
to
the
widow
of
living
and
rent
,
*NL*
And
where
was
the
widow
could
say
him
nay
?
*NL*
*NL*
Both
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
knight
and
the
squire
were
both
left
in
the
mire
,
*NL*
There
for
to
sing
their
roundelay
;
*NL*
For
a
yeoman
of
Kent
,
with
his
yearly
rent
,
*NL*
There
never
was
a
widow
could
say
him
nay
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
,
Wamba
,
''
said
the
knight
,
``
that
our
host
of
the
Trysting-tree
,
*NL*
or
the
jolly
Friar
,
his
chaplain
,
heard
this
thy
ditty
in
praise
of
our
*NL*
bluff
yeoman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
would
not
I
,
''
said
Wamba
--
``
but
for
the
horn
that
hangs
at
your
*NL*
baldric

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay

''
said
the
Knight
,
--
``
this
is
a
pledge
of
Locksley
's
goodwill

I
am
not
like
to
need
it

Three
mots
on
this
bugle
will
,
I
am
assured
,
*NL*
bring
round
,
at
our
need
,
a
jolly
band
of
yonder
honest
yeomen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
say
,
Heaven
forefend

''
said
the
Jester
,
``
were
it
not
that
that
*NL*
fair
gift
is
a
pledge
they
would
let
us
pass
peaceably
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
meanest
thou
?
''
said
the
Knight
;
``
thinkest
thou
that
but
for
*NL*
this
pledge
of
fellowship
they
would
assault
us
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
for
me
I
say
nothing
,
''
said
Wamba
;
``
for
green
trees
have
ears
as
*NL*
well
as
stone
walls

But
canst
thou
construe
me
this
,
Sir
Knight
--
When
*NL*
is
thy
wine-pitcher
and
thy
purse
better
empty
than
full
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
never
,
I
think
,
''
replied
the
Knight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
never
deservest
to
have
a
full
one
in
thy
hand

for
so
simple
an
*NL*
answer

Thou
hadst
best
empty
thy
pitcher
ere
thou
pass
it
to
a
Saxon
,
*NL*
and
leave
thy
money
at
home
ere
thou
walk
in
the
greenwood

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
hold
our
friends
for
robbers
,
then
?
''
said
the
Knight
of
the
*NL*
Fetterlock
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
hear
me
not
say
so
,
fair
sir

''
said
Wamba
;
``
it
may
relieve
a
man

steed
to
take
of
his
mail
when
he
hath
a
long
journey

make
;
and
,

certes

it
may
do
good
to
the
rider

soul

ease
him
of
that
which

evil

therefore
will
I
give
no

his

the

the

*NL*
*NL*
``
A

a

Wamba

You

be

when
you

drunken

But
*NL*
to
go

The
merry-men

set
off

with
the
burning
of

the

robbing

And

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
The
Knight
undid
the
clasp
of
the
baldric

indulged
his
*NL*
fellow-traveller

who
immediately
hung
the
bugle
round
his

*NL*

*NL*

great
caution

*NL*
*NL*
``
My

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay

then
,
Valour

Folly

once

said
the
*NL*
Jester
,
coming
up
frankly
to
the
Knight
's
side
;
``
but
,
in
truth
,
I
love

not
such
buffets

bestowed
on
the

Friar

when
his
*NL*
holiness
rolled
on
the
green
like
a
king
of
the
nine-pins
.
And
now
that
*NL*
Folly
wears
the
horn
,
let
Valour
rouse
himself
,
and
shake
his
mane
;
*NL*
for
,
if

mistake
not

are
company

yonder
brake

are
on
the
*NL*
look-out
for
us

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
makes
thee
judge
so
?
''
said
the
Knight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
have
twice
or
thrice
noticed
the
glance
of
a
motion
from
*NL*
amongst
the
green
leaves
.
Had
they
been
honest
men
,
they
had
kept
the
*NL*
path
.
But
yonder
thicket
is
a
choice
chapel
for
the
Clerks
of
Saint
*NL*
Nicholas
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
my
faith
,
''
said
the
Knight
,
closing
his
visor
,
``
I
think
thou
be
`
st
*NL*
in
the
right
o
n't

''
*NL*
*NL*
And
in
good
time
did
he
close
it
,
for
three
arrows
,
flew
at
the
same
*NL*
instant
from
the
suspected
spot
against
his
head
and
breast
,
one
of
*NL*
which
would
have
penetrated
to
the
brain
,
had
it
not
been
turned
aside
*NL*
by
the
steel
visor
.
The
other
two
were
averted
by
the
gorget
,
and
by
the
*NL*
shield
which
hung
around
his
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks
,
trusty
armourers
,
''
said
the
Knight
.
--
``
Wamba
,
let
us
close
with
*NL*
them
,
''
--
and
he
rode
straight
to
the
thicket
.
He
was
met
by
six
or
seven
*NL*
men-at-arms
,
who
ran
against
him
with
their
lances
at
full
career
.
Three
*NL*
of
the
weapons
struck
against
him
,
and
splintered
with
as
little
effect
*NL*
as
if
they
had
been
driven
against
a
tower
of
steel
.
The
Black
Knight
's
*NL*
eyes
seemed
to
flash
fire
even
through
the
aperture
of
his
visor
.
He
*NL*
raised
himself
in
his
stirrups
with
an
air
of
inexpressible
dignity
,
and
*NL*
exclaimed
,
``
What
means
this
,
my
masters
!
''
--
The
men
made
no
other
reply
*NL*
than
by
drawing
their
swords
and
attacking
him
on
every
side
,
crying
,
*NL*
``
Die
,
tyrant
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
!
Saint
Edward
!
Ha
!
Saint
George
!
''
said
the
Black
Knight
,
striking
*NL*
down
a
man
at
every
invocation
;
``
have
we
traitors
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
opponents
,
desperate
as
they
were
,
bore
back
from
an
arm
which
*NL*
carried
death
in
every
blow
,
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
terror
of
his
*NL*
single
strength
was
about
to
gain
the
battle
against
such
odds
,
when
a
*NL*
knight
,
in
blue
armour
,
who
had
hitherto
kept
himself
behind
the
other
*NL*
assailants
,
spurred
forward
with
his
lance
,
and
taking
aim
,
not
at
the
*NL*
rider
but
at
the
steed
,
wounded
the
noble
animal
mortally
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
a
felon
stroke
!
''
exclaimed
the
Black
Knight
,
as
the
steed
fell
*NL*
to
the
earth
,
bearing
his
rider
along
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
at
this
moment
,
Wamba
winded
the
bugle
,
for
the
whole
had
passed
so
*NL*
speedily
,
that
he
had
not
time
to
do
so
sooner
.
The
sudden
sound
made
*NL*
the
murderers
bear
back
once
more
,
and
Wamba
,
though
so
imperfectly
*NL*
weaponed
,
did
not
hesitate
to
rush
in
and
assist
the
Black
Knight
to
*NL*
rise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shame
on
ye
,
false
cowards
!
''
exclaimed
he
in
the
blue
harness
,
who
*NL*
seemed
to
lead
the
assailants
,
``
do
ye
fly
from
the
empty
blast
of
a
horn
*NL*
blown
by
a
Jester
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Animated
by
his
words
,
they
attacked
the
Black
Knight
anew
,
whose
best
*NL*
refuge
was
now
to
place
his
back
against
an
oak
,
and
defend
himself
with
*NL*
his
sword
.
The
felon
knight
,
who
had
taken
another
spear
,
watching
the
*NL*
moment
when
his
formidable
antagonist
was
most
closely
pressed
,
galloped
*NL*
against
him
in
hopes
to
nail
him
with
his
lance
against
the
tree
,
when
*NL*
his
purpose
was
again
intercepted
by
Wamba
.
The
Jester
,
making
up
by
*NL*
agility
the
want
of
strength
,
and
little
noticed
by
the
men-at-arms
,
who
*NL*
were
busied
in
their
more
important
object
,
hovered
on
the
skirts
of
the
*NL*
fight
,
and
effectually
checked
the
fatal
career
of
the
Blue
Knight
,
by
*NL*
hamstringing
his
horse
with
a
stroke
of
his
sword
.
Horse
and
man
went
to
*NL*
the
ground
;
yet
the
situation
of
the
Knight
of
the
Fetterlock
continued
*NL*
very
precarious
,
as
he
was
pressed
close
by
several
men
completely
*NL*
armed
,
and
began
to
be
fatigued
by
the
violent
exertions
necessary
*NL*
to
defend
himself
on
so
many
points
at
nearly
the
same
moment
,
when
*NL*
a
grey-goose
shaft
suddenly
stretched
on
the
earth
one
of
the
most
*NL*
formidable
of
his
assailants
,
and
a
band
of
yeomen
broke
forth
from
the
*NL*
glade
,
headed
by
Locksley
and
the
jovial
Friar
,
who
,
taking
ready
and
*NL*
effectual
part
in
the
fray
,
soon
disposed
of
the
ruffians
,
all
of
whom
*NL*
lay
on
the
spot
dead
or
mortally
wounded
.
The
Black
Knight
thanked
his
*NL*
deliverers
with
a
dignity
they
had
not
observed
in
his
former
bearing
,
*NL*
which
hitherto
had
seemed
rather
that
of
a
blunt
bold
soldier
,
than
of
a
*NL*
person
of
exalted
rank
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
concerns
me
much
,
''
he
said
,
``
even
before
I
express
my
full
gratitude
*NL*
to
my
ready
friends
,
to
discover
,
if
I
may
,
who
have
been
my
unprovoked
*NL*
enemies
.
--
Open
the
visor
of
that
Blue
Knight
,
Wamba
,
who
seems
the
chief
*NL*
of
these
villains
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Jester
instantly
made
up
to
the
leader
of
the
assassins
,
who
,
*NL*
bruised
by
his
fall
,
and
entangled
under
the
wounded
steed
,
lay
*NL*
incapable
either
of
flight
or
resistance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
valiant
sir
,
''
said
Wamba
,
``
I
must
be
your
armourer
as
well
as
*NL*
your
equerry
--
I
have
dismounted
you
,
and
now
I
will
unhelm
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
with
no
very
gentle
hand
he
undid
the
helmet
of
the
Blue
*NL*
Knight
,
which
,
rolling
to
a
distance
on
the
grass
,
displayed
to
the
*NL*
Knight
of
the
Fetterlock
grizzled
locks
,
and
a
countenance
he
did
not
*NL*
expect
to
have
seen
under
such
circumstances
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Waldemar
Fitzurse
!
''
he
said
in
astonishment
;
``
what
could
urge
one
of
*NL*
thy
rank
and
seeming
worth
to
so
foul
an
undertaking
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Richard

''
said
the
captive
Knight
,
looking
up
to
him
,
``
thou
knowest
*NL*
little
of
mankind
,
if
thou
knowest
not
to
what
ambition
and
revenge

lead
every
child
of
Adam
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Revenge
?
''
answered
the
Black
Knight
;
``
I
never
wronged
thee
--
On
me
thou
*NL*
hast
nought
to
revenge

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
daughter

Richard

Richard

sparkled
with
indignation

his

it

He
pressed

*NL*
Richard
looked
around
,
and
beheld
the
jovial
Friar
on
his
knees
,
telling
*NL*
his
rosary
,
while
his
quarter-staff
,
which
had
not
been
idle
during
the
*NL*
skirmish
,
lay
on
the
grass
beside
him
.
His
countenance
was
gathered
so
*NL*
as
he
thought
might
best
express
the
most
profound
contrition
,
his
*NL*
eyes
being
turned
up
,
and
the
corners
of
his
mouth
drawn
down
,
as
Wamba
*NL*
expressed
it
,
like
the
tassels
at
the
mouth
of
a

Yet
this
demure
*NL*
affectation
of
extreme
penitence
was
whimsically
belied
by
a
ludicrous
*NL*
meaning
which
lurked
in
his
huge
features
,
and
seemed
to
pronounce
his
*NL*
fear

repentance
alike
hypocritical

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak

the

afraid
perhaps
of
again
giving
offence
by
continuing

the
conversation
in

jocose
a

a
false
step
to
be

bowed
profoundly

on

Prior
of
Botolph

*NL*
palfrey

Gurth

who
attended
him

on
the
Knight

own
war-horse

The
astonishment
of
Ivanhoe
was
beyond

when
he
saw
his
master
*NL*
besprinkled
with
blood
,
and
six
or
seven
dead
bodies
lying
around
in
*NL*
the
little
glade
in
which
the
battle
had
taken
place
.
Nor
was
he
less
*NL*
surprised
to
see
Richard
surrounded
by
so
many
silvan
attendants
,
the
*NL*
outlaws
,
as
they
seemed
to
be
,
of
the
forest
,
and
a
perilous
retinue
*NL*
therefore
for
a
prince
.
He
hesitated
whether
to
address
the
King
as
the
*NL*
Black
Knight-errant
,
or
in
what
other
manner
to
demean
himself
towards

Richard
saw
his
embarrassment

stepping

*NL*
*NL*
``
Treason

the

said
Richard

smiling
;
``
a

*NL*
*NL*
``
It

said
Ivanhoe
;
``
it
is
not
of
more
consequence

noble

you
thus
vex

expose
your

*NL*
*NL*

said
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ho

ho

my

answered
Richard
,
impatiently
;
``
I
*NL*
tell
thee
,
Sir
Wilfred

the
best
of
them
are
most
willing

repay

my
follies
in
kind

For
example
,
my
very
faithful
servant
,
Wilfred
of
*NL*
Ivanhoe
,
will
not
obey
my
positive
commands
,
and
yet
reads
his
king
a
*NL*
homily
,
because
he
does
not
walk
exactly
by
his
advice

Which
of
us
has
*NL*
most
reason
to
upbraid
the
other
?

Yet
forgive
me
,
my
faithful
Wilfred

*NL*
The
time
I
have
spent
,
and
am
yet
to
spend
in
concealment
,
is
,
as
I
*NL*
explained
to
thee
at
Saint
Botolph
's
,
necessary
to
give
my
friends
*NL*
and
faithful
nobles
time
to
assemble
their
forces
,
that
when
Richard
's
*NL*
return
is
announced
,
he
should
be
at
the
head
of
such
a
force

enemies
*NL*
shall
tremble
to
face
,
and
thus
subdue
the
meditated
treason
,
without
*NL*
even
unsheathing
a
sword
.
Estoteville
and
Bohun
will
not
be
strong
*NL*
enough
to
move
forward
to
York
for
twenty-four
hours
.
I
must
have
news
*NL*
of
Salisbury
from
the
south
;
and
of
Beauchamp
,
in
Warwickshire
;
and
of
*NL*
Multon
and
Percy
in
the
north
.
The
Chancellor
must
make
sure
of
London
.
*NL*
Too
sudden
an
appearance
would
subject
me
to
dangers
,
other
than
*NL*
my
lance
and
sword
,
though
backed
by
the
bow
of
bold
Robin
,
or
the
*NL*
quarter-staff
of
Friar
Tuck
,
and
the
horn
of
the
sage
Wamba
,
may
be
able
*NL*
to
rescue
me
from
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wilfred
bowed
in
submission
,
well
knowing
how
vain
it
was
to
contend
*NL*
with
the
wild
spirit
of
chivalry
which
so
often
impelled
his
master
*NL*
upon
dangers
which
he
might
easily
have
avoided
,
or
rather
,
which
it
*NL*
was
unpardonable
in
him
to
have
sought
out
.
The
young
knight
sighed
,
*NL*
therefore
,
and
held
his
peace
;
while
Richard
,
rejoiced
at
having
*NL*
silenced
his
counsellor
,
though
his
heart
acknowledged
the
justice
of
*NL*
the
charge
he
had
brought
against
him
,
went
on
in
conversation
with
*NL*
Robin
Hood
.
--
``
King
of
Outlaws
,
''
he
said
,
``
have
you
no
refreshment
to
*NL*
offer
to
your
brother
sovereign
?
for
these
dead
knaves
have
found
me
*NL*
both
in
exercise
and
appetite
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
troth
,
''
replied
the
Outlaw
,
``
for
I
scorn
to
lie
to
your
Grace

*NL*

larder
is
chiefly
supplied
with

''
He
stopped
,
and
was
somewhat
*NL*
embarrassed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
venison
,
I
suppose
?
''
said
Richard
,
gaily
;
``
better
food
at
need
*NL*
there
can
be
none
--
and
truly
,
if
a
king
will
not
remain
at
home
and
*NL*
slay
his
own
game
,
methinks
he
should
not
brawl
too
loud
if
he
finds
it
*NL*
killed
to
his
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
your
Grace
,
then
,
''
said
Robin
,
``
will
again
honour
with
your
presence
*NL*
one
of
Robin
Hood
's
places
of
rendezvous
,
the
venison
shall
not
be
*NL*
lacking
;
and
a
stoup
of
ale
,
and
it
may
be
a
cup
of
reasonably
good
*NL*
wine
,
to
relish
it
withal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Outlaw
accordingly
led
the
way
,
followed
by
the
buxom
Monarch
,
*NL*
more
happy
,
probably
,
in
this
chance
meeting
with
Robin
Hood
and
his
*NL*
foresters
,
than
he
would
have
been
in
again
assuming
his
royal
state
,
*NL*
and
presiding
over
a
splendid
circle
of
peers
and
nobles
.
Novelty
in
*NL*
society
and
adventure
were
the
zest
of
life
to
Richard
Coeur-de-Lion
,
*NL*
and
it
had
its
highest
relish
when
enhanced
by
dangers
encountered
*NL*
and
surmounted
.
In
the
lion-hearted
King
,
the
brilliant
,
but
useless
*NL*
character
,
of
a
knight
of
romance
,
was
in
a
great
measure
realized
and
*NL*
revived
;
and
the
personal
glory
which
he
acquired
by
his
own
deeds
of
*NL*
arms
,
was
far
more
dear
to
his
excited
imagination
,
than
that
which
a
*NL*
course
of
policy
and
wisdom
would
have
spread
around
his
government
.
*NL*
Accordingly
,
his
reign
was
like
the
course
of
a
brilliant
and
rapid
*NL*
meteor
,
which
shoots
along
the
face
of
Heaven
,
shedding
around
an
*NL*
unnecessary
and
portentous
light
,
which
is
instantly
swallowed
up
by
*NL*
universal
darkness
;
his
feats
of
chivalry
furnishing
themes
for
bards
*NL*
and
minstrels
,
but
affording
none
of
those
solid
benefits
to
his
country
*NL*
on
which
history
loves
to
pause
,
and
hold
up
as
an
example
to
posterity
.
*NL*
But
in
his
present
company
Richard
showed
to
the
greatest
imaginable
*NL*
advantage
.
He
was
gay
,
good-humoured
,
and
fond
of
manhood
in
every
rank
*NL*
of
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beneath
a
huge
oak-tree
the
silvan
repast
was
hastily
prepared
for
the
*NL*
King
of
England
,
surrounded
by
men
outlaws
to
his
government
,
but
who
*NL*
now
formed
his
court
and
his
guard
.
As
the
flagon
went
round
,
the
rough
*NL*
foresters
soon
lost
their
awe
for
the
presence
of
Majesty
.
The
song
*NL*
and
the
jest
were
exchanged
--
the
stories
of
former
deeds
were
told
*NL*
with
advantage
;
and
at
length
,
and
while
boasting
of
their
successful
*NL*
infraction
of
the
laws
,
no
one
recollected
they
were
speaking
in
*NL*
presence
of
their
natural
guardian
.
The
merry
King
,
nothing
heeding
his
*NL*
dignity
any
more
than
his
company
,
laughed
,
quaffed
,
and
jested
among
*NL*
the
jolly
band
.
The
natural
and
rough
sense
of
Robin
Hood
led
him
to
be
*NL*
desirous
that
the
scene
should
be
closed
ere
any
thing
should
occur
to
*NL*
disturb
its
harmony
,
the
more
especially
that
he
observed
Ivanhoe
's
brow
*NL*
clouded
with
anxiety
.
``
We
are
honoured
,
''
he
said
to
Ivanhoe
,
apart
,
``
by
*NL*
the
presence
of
our
gallant
Sovereign
;
yet
I
would
not
that
he
dallied
*NL*
with
time
,
which
the
circumstances
of
his
kingdom
may
render
precious
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
well
and
wisely
spoken
,
brave
Robin
Hood
,
''
said
Wilfred
,
apart
;
*NL*
``
and
know
,
moreover
,
that
they
who
jest
with
Majesty
even
in
its
gayest
*NL*
mood
are
but
toying
with
the
lion
's
whelp
,
which
,
on
slight
provocation
,
*NL*
uses
both
fangs
and
claws
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
touched
the
very
cause
of
my
fear
,
''
said
the
Outlaw
;
``
my
*NL*
men
are
rough
by
practice
and
nature
,
the
King
is
hasty
as
well
as
*NL*
good-humoured
;
nor
know
I
how
soon
cause
of
offence
may
arise
,
or
how
*NL*
warmly
it
may
be
received
--
it
is
time
this
revel
were
broken
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
must
be
by
your
management
then
,
gallant
yeoman
,
''
said
Ivanhoe
;
*NL*
``
for
each
hint
I
have
essayed
to
give
him
serves
only
to
induce
him
to
*NL*
prolong
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Must
I
so
soon
risk
the
pardon
and
favour
of
my
Sovereign
?
''
said
Robin
*NL*
Hood
,
pausing
for
all
instant
;
``
but
by
Saint
Christopher
,
it
shall
be
*NL*
so
.
I
were
undeserving
his
grace
did
I
not
peril
it
for
his
good
.
--
Here
,
*NL*
Scathlock
,
get
thee
behind
yonder
thicket
,
and
wind
me
a
Norman
blast
on
*NL*
thy
bugle
,
and
without
an
instant
's
delay
on
peril
of
your
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Scathlock
obeyed
his
captain
,
and
in
less
than
five
minutes
the
*NL*
revellers
were
startled
by
the
sound
of
his
horn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
the
bugle
of
Malvoisin
,
''
said
the
Miller
,
starting
to
his
feet
,
*NL*
and
seizing
his
bow
.
The
Friar
dropped
the
flagon
,
and
grasped
his
*NL*
quarter-staff
.
Wamba
stopt
short
in
the
midst
of
a
jest
,
and
betook
*NL*
himself
to
sword
and
target
.
All
the
others
stood
to
their
weapons
.
*NL*
*NL*
Men
of
their
precarious
course
of
life
change
readily
from
the
banquet
*NL*
to
the
battle
;
and
,
to
Richard
,
the
exchange
seemed
but
a
succession
of
*NL*
pleasure
.
He
called
for
his
helmet
and
the
most
cumbrous
parts
of
his
*NL*
armour
,
which
he
had
laid
aside
;
and
while
Gurth
was
putting
them
on
,
*NL*
he
laid
his
strict
injunctions
on
Wilfred
,
under
pain
of
his
highest
*NL*
displeasure
,
not
to
engage
in
the
skirmish
which
he
supposed
was
*NL*
approaching
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
hast
fought
for
me
an
hundred
times
,
Wilfred
,
--
and
I
have
seen
*NL*
it
.
Thou
shalt
this
day
look
on
,
and
see
how
Richard
will
fight
for
his
*NL*
friend
and
liegeman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
Robin
Hood
had
sent
off
several
of
his
followers
in
*NL*
different
directions
,
as
if
to
reconnoitre
the
enemy
;
and
when
he
saw
*NL*
the
company
effectually
broken
up
,
he
approached
Richard
,
who
was
now
*NL*
completely
armed
,
and
,
kneeling
down
on
one
knee
,
craved
pardon
of
his
*NL*
Sovereign
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
what
,
good
yeoman
?
''
said
Richard
,
somewhat
impatiently
.
``
Have
we
*NL*
not
already
granted
thee
a
full
pardon
for
all
transgressions
?
Thinkest
*NL*
thou
our
word
is
a
feather
,
to
be
blown
backward
and
forward
between
us
?
*NL*
Thou
canst
not
have
had
time
to
commit
any
new
offence
since
that
time
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
but
I
have
though
,
''
answered
the
yeoman
,
``
if
it
be
an
offence
to
*NL*
deceive
my
prince
for
his
own
advantage
.
The
bugle
you
have
heard
*NL*
was
none
of
Malvoisin
's
,
but
blown
by
my
direction
,
to
break
off
the
*NL*
banquet
,
lest
it
trenched
upon
hours
of
dearer
import
than
to
be
thus
*NL*
dallied
with
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
then
rose
from
his
knee
,
folded
his
arm
on
his
bosom
,
and
in
a
manner
*NL*
rather
respectful
than
submissive
,
awaited
the
answer
of
the
King
,
--
like
*NL*
one
who
is
conscious
he
may
have
given
offence
,
yet
is
confident
in
the
*NL*
rectitude
of
his
motive
.
The
blood
rushed
in
anger
to
the
countenance
*NL*
of
Richard
;
but
it
was
the
first
transient
emotion
,
and
his
sense
of
*NL*
justice
instantly
subdued
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
King
of
Sherwood
,
''
he
said
,
``
grudges
his
venison
and
his
wine-flask
*NL*
to
the
King
of
England

It
is
well
,
bold
Robin
!
--
but
when
you
come
to
*NL*
see
me
in
merry
London
,
I
trust
to
be
a
less
niggard
host
.
Thou
art
*NL*
right
,
however
,
good
fellow

Let
us
therefore
to
horse
and
away

Wilfred
*NL*
has
been
impatient
this
hour

Tell
me

bold
Robin

thou
never
a

friend
in
thy
band

who

not
content
with
advising
,
will
needs
direct
*NL*
thy
motions
,
and
look
miserable

thou
dost
presume
to
act
for
*NL*
thyself

*NL*
*NL*
``
Such
a
one

said
Robin
,
``

Lieutenant

Little
John

sometimes
displeased

freedom

*NL*
``
Thou
art
right

answered
Richard
;
``
and
if
I
had
Ivanhoe

*NL*
Robin
Hood
assured
them
that
he
had
detached
a
party
in
the
direction
of
*NL*
the
road
they
were
to
pass
,
who
would
not
fail
to
discover
and
apprize
*NL*
them
of
any
secret
ambuscade
;
and
that
he
had
little
doubt
they
would
*NL*
find
the
ways
secure
,
or
,
if
otherwise
,
would
receive
such
timely
notice
*NL*
of
the
danger
as
would
enable
them
to
fall
back
on
a
strong
troop
of
*NL*
archers
,
with
which
he
himself
proposed
to
follow
on
the
same
route
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
wise
and
attentive
precautions
adopted
for
his
safety
touched
*NL*
Richard
's
feelings
,
and
removed
any
slight
grudge
which
he
might
retain
*NL*
on
account
of
the
deception
the
Outlaw
Captain
had
practised
upon
him
.
*NL*
He
once
more
extended
his
hand
to
Robin
Hood
,
assured
him
of
his
full
*NL*
pardon
and
future
favour
,
as
well
as
his
firm
resolution
to
restrain
the
*NL*
tyrannical
exercise
of
the
forest
rights
and
other
oppressive
laws
,
by
*NL*
which
so
many
English
yeomen
were
driven
into
a
state
of
rebellion
.
But
*NL*
Richard
's
good
intentions
towards
the
bold
Outlaw
were
frustrated
by
the
*NL*
King
's
untimely
death
;
and
the
Charter
of
the
Forest
was
extorted
*NL*
from
the
unwilling
hands
of
King
John
when
he
succeeded
to
his
heroic
*NL*
brother
.
As
for
the
rest
of
Robin
Hood
's
career
,
as
well
as
the
tale
*NL*
of
his
treacherous
death
,
they
are
to
be
found
in
those
black-letter
*NL*
garlands

once
sold
at

low

The
Outlaw
's
opinion
proved
true
;
and
the
King
,
attended
by
Ivanhoe
,
*NL*
Gurth
,
and
Wamba
,
arrived
,
without
any
interruption
,
within
view
of
the
*NL*
Castle
of
Coningsburgh
,
while
the
sun
was
yet
in
the
horizon
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
few
more
beautiful
or
striking
scenes
in
England
,
than
are
*NL*
presented
by
the
vicinity
of
this
ancient
Saxon
fortress
.
The
soft
and
*NL*
gentle
river
Don
sweeps
through
an
amphitheatre
,
in
which
cultivation
is
*NL*
richly
blended
with
woodland
,
and
on
a
mount
,
ascending
from
the
river
,
*NL*
well
defended
by
walls
and
ditches
,
rises
this
ancient
edifice
,
which
,
*NL*
as
its
Saxon
name
implies
,
was
,
previous
to
the
Conquest
,
a
royal
*NL*
residence
of
the
kings
of
England
.
The
outer
walls
have
probably
been
*NL*
added
by
the
Normans
,
but
the
inner
keep
bears
token
of
very
great
*NL*
antiquity
.
It
is
situated
on
a
mount
at
one
angle
of
the
inner
court
,
*NL*
and
forms
a
complete
circle
of
perhaps
twenty-five
feet
in
diameter
.
*NL*
The
wall
is
of
immense
thickness
,
and
is
propped
or
defended
by
six
huge
*NL*
external
buttresses
which
project
from
the
circle
,
and
rise
up
against
*NL*
the
sides
of
the
tower
as
if
to
strengthen
or
to
support
it
.
These
*NL*
massive
buttresses
are
solid
when
they
arise
from
the
foundation
,
and
a
*NL*
good
way
higher
up
;
but
are
hollowed
out
towards
the
top
,
and
terminate
*NL*
in
a
sort
of
turrets
communicating
with
the
interior
of
the
keep
itself
.
*NL*
The
distant
appearance
of
this
huge
building
,
with
these
singular
*NL*
accompaniments
,
is
as
interesting
to
the
lovers
of
the
picturesque
,
as
*NL*
the
interior
of
the
castle
is
to
the
eager
antiquary
,
whose
imagination
*NL*
it
carries
back
to
the
days
of
the
Heptarchy
.
A
barrow
,
in
the
vicinity
*NL*
of
the
castle
,
is
pointed
out
as
the
tomb
of
the
memorable
Hengist
;
and
*NL*
various
monuments
,
of
great
antiquity
and
curiosity
,
are
shown
in
the
*NL*
neighbouring
churchyard
.

When
Coeur-de-Lion
and
his
retinue
approached
this
rude
yet
*NL*
stately
building
,
it
was
not
,
as
at
present
,
surrounded
by
external
*NL*
fortifications
.
The
Saxon
architect
had
exhausted
his
art
in
rendering
*NL*
the
main
keep
defensible
,
and
there
was
no
other
circumvallation
than
a
*NL*
rude
barrier
of
palisades
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
huge
black
banner
,
which
floated
from
the
top
of
the
tower
,
announced
*NL*
that
the
obsequies
of
the
late
owner
were
still
in
the
act
of
being
*NL*
solemnized
.
It
bore
no
emblem
of
the
deceased
's
birth
or
quality
,
*NL*
for
armorial
bearings
were
then
a
novelty
among
the
Norman
chivalry
*NL*
themselves
and
,
were
totally
unknown
to
the
Saxons
.
But
above
the
*NL*
gate
was
another
banner
,
on
which
the
figure
of
a
white
horse
,
*NL*
rudely
painted
,
indicated
the
nation
and
rank
of
the
deceased
,
by
the
*NL*
well-known
symbol
of
Hengist
and
his
Saxon
warriors
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
around
the
castle
was
a
scene
of
busy
commotion
;
for
such
funeral
*NL*
banquets
were
times
of
general
and
profuse
hospitality
,
which
not
only
*NL*
every
one
who
could
claim
the
most
distant
connexion
with
the
deceased
,
*NL*
but
all
passengers
whatsoever
,
were
invited
to
partake
.
The
wealth
and
*NL*
consequence
of
the
deceased
Athelstane
,
occasioned
this
custom
to
be
*NL*
observed
in
the
fullest
extent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Numerous
parties
,
therefore
,
were
seen
ascending
and
descending
the
hill
*NL*
on
which
the
castle
was
situated
;
and
when
the
King
and
his
attendants
*NL*
entered
the
open
and
unguarded
gates
of
the
external
barrier
,
the
space
*NL*
within
presented
a
scene
not
easily
reconciled
with
the
cause
of
the
*NL*
assemblage
.
In
one
place
cooks
were
toiling
to
roast
huge
oxen
,
and
fat
*NL*
sheep
;
in
another
,
hogsheads
of
ale
were
set
abroach
,
to
be
drained
at
*NL*
the
freedom
of
all
comers
.
Groups
of
every
description
were
to
be
seen
*NL*
devouring
the
food
and
swallowing
the
liquor
thus
abandoned
to
*NL*
their
discretion
.
The
naked
Saxon
serf
was
drowning
the
sense
of
*NL*
his
half-year
's
hunger
and
thirst
,
in
one
day
of
gluttony
and
*NL*
drunkenness
--
the
more
pampered
burgess
and
guild-brother
was
eating
his
*NL*
morsel
with
gust
,
or
curiously
criticising
the
quantity
of
the
malt
and
*NL*
the
skill
of
the
brewer
.
Some
few
of
the
poorer
Norman
gentry
might
also
*NL*
be
seen
,
distinguished
by
their
shaven
chins
and
short
cloaks
,
and
not
*NL*
less
so
by
their
keeping
together
,
and
looking
with
great
scorn
on
the
*NL*
whole
solemnity
,
even
while
condescending
to
avail
themselves
of
the
*NL*
good
cheer
which
was
so
liberally
supplied
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mendicants
were
of
course
assembled
by
the
score
,
together
with
*NL*
strolling
soldiers
returned
from
Palestine
,
-LRB-
according
to
their
own
*NL*
account
at
least
,
-RRB-
pedlars
were
displaying
their
wares
,
travelling
*NL*
mechanics
were
enquiring
after
employment
,
and
wandering
palmers
,
*NL*
hedge-priests
,
Saxon
minstrels
,
and
Welsh
bards
,
were
muttering
prayers
,
*NL*
and
extracting
mistuned
dirges
from
their
harps
,
crowds
,
and
rotes
.

One
sent
forth
the
praises
of
Athelstane
in
a
doleful
panegyric
;
*NL*
another
,
in
a
Saxon
genealogical
poem
,
rehearsed
the
uncouth
and
harsh
*NL*
names
of
his
noble
ancestry
.
Jesters
and
jugglers
were
not
awanting
,
*NL*
nor
was
the
occasion
of
the
assembly
supposed
to
render
the
exercise
of
*NL*
their
profession
indecorous
or
improper
.
Indeed
the
ideas
of
the
Saxons
*NL*
on
these
occasions
were
as
natural
as
they
were
rude
.
If
sorrow
was
*NL*
thirsty
,
there
was
drink
--
if
hungry
,
there
was
food
--
if
it
sunk
down
*NL*
upon
and
saddened
the
heart
,
here
were
the
means
supplied
of
mirth
,
or
*NL*
at
least
of
amusement
.
Nor
did
the
assistants
scorn
to
avail
themselves
*NL*
of
those
means
of
consolation
,
although
,
every
now
and
then
,
as
if
*NL*
suddenly
recollecting
the
cause
which
had
brought
them
together
,
the
men
*NL*
groaned
in
unison
,
while
the
females
,
of
whom
many
were
present
,
raised
*NL*
up
their
voices
and
shrieked
for
very
woe
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
the
scene
in
the
castle-yard
at
Coningsburgh
when
it
was
*NL*
entered
by
Richard
and
his
followers
.
The
seneschal
or
steward
deigned
*NL*
not
to
take
notice
of
the
groups
of
inferior
guests
who
were
perpetually
*NL*
entering
and
withdrawing
,
unless
so
far
as
was
necessary
to
preserve
*NL*
order
;
nevertheless
he
was
struck
by
the
good
mien
of
the
Monarch
and
*NL*
Ivanhoe
,
more
especially
as
he
imagined
the
features
of
the
latter
were
*NL*
familiar
to
him
.
Besides
,
the
approach
of
two
knights
,
for
such
their
*NL*
dress
bespoke
them
,
was
a
rare
event
at
a
Saxon
solemnity
,
and
could
not
*NL*
but
be
regarded
as
a
sort
of
honour
to
the
deceased
and
his
family
.
And
*NL*
in
his
sable
dress
,
and
holding
in
his
hand
his
white
wand
of
office
,
*NL*
this
important
personage
made
way
through
the
miscellaneous
assemblage
*NL*
of
guests
,
thus
conducting
Richard
and
Ivanhoe
to
the
entrance
of
the
*NL*
tower
.
Gurth
and
Wamba
speedily
found
acquaintances
in
the
court-yard
,
*NL*
nor
presumed
to
intrude
themselves
any
farther
until
their
presence

should
be

Old
Play
*NL*
*NL*
The
mode
of
entering
the
great
tower
of
Coningsburgh
Castle
is
very
*NL*
peculiar
,
and
partakes
of
the
rude
simplicity
of
the
early
times
in
*NL*
which
it
was
erected
.
A
flight
of
steps
,
so
deep
and
narrow
as
to
be
*NL*
almost
precipitous
,
leads
up
to
a
low
portal
in
the
south
side
of
the
*NL*
tower
,
by
which
the
adventurous
antiquary
may
still
,
or
at
least
could
*NL*
a
few
years
since
,
gain
access
to
a
small
stair
within
the
thickness
*NL*
of
the
main
wall
of
the
tower
,
which
leads
up
to
the
third
story
of
the
*NL*
building
,
--
the
two
lower
being
dungeons
or
vaults
,
which
neither
receive
*NL*
air
nor
light
,
save
by
a
square
hole
in
the
third
story
,
with
which
*NL*
they
seem
to
have
communicated
by
a
ladder
.
The
access
to
the
upper
*NL*
apartments
in
the
tower
which
consist
in
all
of
four
stories
,
is
given
*NL*
by
stairs
which
are
carried
up
through
the
external
buttresses
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
difficult
and
complicated
entrance
,
the
good
King
Richard
,
*NL*
followed
by
his
faithful
Ivanhoe
,
was
ushered
into
the
round
apartment
*NL*
which
occupies
the
whole
of
the
third
story
from
the
ground
.
Wilfred
,
*NL*
by
the
difficulties
of
the
ascent
,
gained
time
to
muffle
his
face
in
his
*NL*
mantle
,
as
it
had
been
held
expedient
that
he
should
not
present
himself
*NL*
to
his
father
until
the
King
should
give
him
the
signal
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
assembled
in
this
apartment
,
around
a
large
oaken
table
,
*NL*
about
a
dozen
of
the
most
distinguished
representatives
of
the
Saxon
*NL*
families
in
the
adjacent
counties
.
They
were
all
old
,
or
,
at
least
,
*NL*
elderly
men
;
for
the
younger
race
,
to
the
great
displeasure
of
the
*NL*
seniors
,
had
,
like
Ivanhoe
,
broken
down
many
of
the
barriers
which
*NL*
separated
for
half
a
century
the
Norman
victors
from
the
vanquished
*NL*
Saxons
.
The
downcast
and
sorrowful
looks
of
these
venerable
men
,
their
*NL*
silence
and
their
mournful
posture
,
formed
a
strong
contrast
to
the
*NL*
levity
of
the
revellers
on
the
outside
of
the
castle
.
Their
grey
locks
*NL*
and
long
full
beards
,
together
with
their
antique
tunics
and
loose
black
*NL*
mantles
,
suited
well
with
the
singular
and
rude
apartment
in
which
they
*NL*
were
seated
,
and
gave
the
appearance
of
a
band
of
ancient
worshippers
of
*NL*
Woden
,
recalled
to
life
to
mourn
over
the
decay
of
their
national
glory
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cedric
,
seated
in
equal
rank
among
his
countrymen
,
seemed
yet
,
by
common
*NL*
consent
,
to
act
as
chief
of
the
assembly
.
Upon
the
entrance
of
Richard
*NL*
-LRB-
only
known
to
him
as
the
valorous
Knight
of
the
Fetterlock
-RRB-
he
arose
*NL*
gravely
,
and
gave
him
welcome
by
the
ordinary
salutation
,
``
Waes
hael
''
,
*NL*
raising
at
the
same
time
a
goblet
to
his
head
.
The
King
,
no
stranger
*NL*
to
the
customs
of
his
English
subjects
,
returned
the
greeting
with
the
*NL*
appropriate
words
,
``
Drinc
hael
''
,
and
partook
of
a
cup
which
was
handed
*NL*
to
him
by
the
sewer
.
The
same
courtesy
was
offered
to
Ivanhoe
,
who
*NL*
pledged
his
father
in
silence
,
supplying
the
usual
speech
by
an
*NL*
inclination
of
his
head
,
lest
his
voice
should
have
been
recognised
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
this
introductory
ceremony
was
performed
,
Cedric
arose
,
and
,
*NL*
extending
his
hand
to
Richard
,
conducted
him
into
a
small
and
very
rude
*NL*
chapel
,
which
was
excavated
,
as
it
were
,
out
of
one
of
the
external
*NL*
buttresses
.
As
there
was
no
opening
,
saving
a
little
narrow
loop-hole
,
*NL*
the
place
would
have
been
nearly
quite
dark
but
for
two
flambeaux
or
*NL*
torches
,
which
showed
,
by
a
red
and
smoky
light
,
the
arched
roof
and
*NL*
naked
walls
,
the
rude
altar
of
stone
,
and
the
crucifix
of
the
same
*NL*
material
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
this
altar
was
placed
a
bier
,
and
on
each
side
of
this
bier
*NL*
kneeled
three
priests
,
who
told
their
beads
,
and
muttered
their
prayers
,
*NL*
with
the
greatest
signs
of
external
devotion
.
For
this
service
a
*NL*
splendid
``
soul-scat
''
was
paid
to
the
convent
of
Saint
Edmund
's
by
the
*NL*
mother
of
the
deceased
;
and
,
that
it
might
be
fully
deserved
,
the
whole
*NL*
brethren
,
saving
the
lame
Sacristan
,
had
transferred
themselves
to
*NL*
Coningsburgh
,
where
,
while
six
of
their
number
were
constantly
on
guard
*NL*
in
the
performance
of
divine
rites
by
the
bier
of
Athelstane
,
the
others
*NL*
failed
not
to
take
their
share
of
the
refreshments
and
amusements
which
*NL*
went
on
at
the
castle
.
In
maintaining
this
pious
watch
and
ward
,
the
*NL*
good
monks
were
particularly
careful
not
to
interrupt
their
hymns
for
*NL*
an
instant
,
lest
Zernebock
,
the
ancient
Saxon
Apollyon
,
should
lay
*NL*
his
clutches
on
the
departed
Athelstane
.
Nor
were
they
less
careful
to
*NL*
prevent
any
unhallowed
layman
from
touching
the
pall
,
which
,
having
been
*NL*
that
used
at
the
funeral
of
Saint
Edmund
,
was
liable
to
be
desecrated
,
*NL*
if
handled
by
the
profane
.
If
,
in
truth
,
these
attentions
could
be
of
*NL*
any
use
to
the
deceased
,
he
had
some
right
to
expect
them
at
the
hands
*NL*
of
the
brethren
of
Saint
Edmund
's
,
since
,
besides
a
hundred
mancuses
*NL*
of
gold
paid
down
as
the
soul-ransom
,
the
mother
of
Athelstane
had
*NL*
announced
her
intention
of
endowing
that
foundation
with
the
better
part
*NL*
of
the
lands
of
the
deceased
,
in
order
to
maintain
perpetual
prayers
for
*NL*
his
soul
,
and
that
of
her
departed
husband
.
Richard
and
Wilfred
followed
*NL*
the
Saxon
Cedric
into
the
apartment
of
death
,
where
,
as
their
guide
*NL*
pointed
with
solemn
air
to
the
untimely
bier
of
Athelstane
,
they
*NL*
followed
his
example
in
devoutly
crossing
themselves
,
and
muttering
a
*NL*
brief
prayer
for
the
weal
of
the
departed
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
act
of
pious
charity
performed
,
Cedric
again
motioned
them
to
*NL*
follow
him
,
gliding
over
the
stone
floor
with
a
noiseless
tread
;
and
,
*NL*
after
ascending
a
few
steps
,
opened
with
great
caution
the
door
of
a
*NL*
small
oratory
,
which
adjoined
to
the
chapel
.
It
was
about
eight
feet
*NL*
square
,
hollowed
,
like
the
chapel
itself
,
out
of
the
thickness
of
the
*NL*
wall
;
and
the
loop-hole
,
which
enlightened
it
,
being
to
the
west
,
and
*NL*
widening
considerably
as
it
sloped
inward
,
a
beam
of
the
setting
sun
*NL*
found
its
way
into
its
dark
recess
,
and
showed
a
female
of
a
dignified
*NL*
mien
,
and
whose
countenance
retained
the
marked
remains
of
majestic
*NL*
beauty
.
Her
long
mourning
robes
and
her
flowing
wimple
of
black
cypress
,
*NL*
enhanced
the
whiteness
of
her
skin
,
and
the
beauty
of
her
light-coloured
*NL*
and
flowing
tresses
,
which
time
had
neither
thinned
nor
mingled
with
*NL*
silver
.
Her
countenance
expressed
the
deepest
sorrow
that
is
consistent
*NL*
with
resignation
.
On
the
stone
table
before
her
stood
a
crucifix
*NL*
of
ivory
,
beside
which
was
laid
a
missal
,
having
its
pages
richly
*NL*
illuminated
,
and
its
boards
adorned
with
clasps
of
gold
,
and
bosses
of
*NL*
the
same
precious
metal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Noble
Edith
,
''
said
Cedric
,
after
having
stood
a
moment
silent
,
as
if
*NL*
to
give
Richard
and
Wilfred
time
to
look
upon
the
lady
of
the
mansion
,
*NL*
``
these
are
worthy
strangers
,
come
to
take
a
part
in
thy
sorrows
.
And
*NL*
this
,
in
especial
,
is
the
valiant
Knight
who
fought
so
bravely
for
the
*NL*
deliverance
of
him
for
whom
we
this
day
mourn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
bravery
has
my
thanks
,
''
returned
the
lady
;
``
although
it
be
the
*NL*
will
of
Heaven
that
it
should
be
displayed
in
vain
.
I
thank
,
too
,
his
*NL*
courtesy
,
and
that
of
his
companion
,
which
hath
brought
them
hither
to
*NL*
behold
the
widow
of
Adeling
,
the
mother
of
Athelstane
,
in
her
deep
hour
*NL*
of
sorrow
and
lamentation
.
To
your
care
,
kind
kinsman
,
I
intrust
them
,
*NL*
satisfied
that
they
will
want
no
hospitality
which
these
sad
walls
can
*NL*
yet
afford
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
guests
bowed
deeply
to
the
mourning
parent
,
and
withdrew
from
their
*NL*
hospitable
guide
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
winding
stair
conducted
them
to
an
apartment
of
the
same
size
*NL*
with
that
which
they
had
first
entered
,
occupying
indeed
the
story
*NL*
immediately
above
.
From
this
room
,
ere
yet
the
door
was
opened
,
*NL*
proceeded
a
low
and
melancholy
strain
of
vocal
music
.
When
they
entered
,
*NL*
they
found
themselves
in
the
presence
of
about
twenty
matrons
and
*NL*
maidens
of
distinguished
Saxon
lineage
.
Four
maidens
,
Rowena
leading
the
*NL*
choir
,
raised
a
hymn
for
the
soul
of
the
deceased
,
of
which
we
have
only
*NL*
been
able
to
decipher
two
or
three
stanzas
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
Dust
unto
dust
,
*NL*
To
this
all
must
;
*NL*
The
tenant
hath
resign
'd
*NL*
The
faded
form
*NL*
To
waste
and
worm
--
*NL*
Corruption
claims
her
kind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Through
paths
unknown
*NL*
Thy
soul
hath
flown
,
*NL*
To
seek
the
realms
of
woe
,
*NL*
Where
fiery
pain
*NL*
Shall
purge
the
stain
*NL*
Of
actions
done
below
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
that
sad
place
,
*NL*
By
Mary
's
grace
,
*NL*
Brief
may
thy
dwelling
be
*NL*
Till
prayers
and
alms
,
*NL*
And
holy
psalms
,
*NL*
Shall
set
the
captive
free
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
this
dirge
was
sung
,
in
a
low
and
melancholy
tone
,
by
the
female
*NL*
choristers
,
the
others
were
divided
into
two
bands
,
of
which
one
was
*NL*
engaged
in
bedecking
,
with
such
embroidery
as
their
skill
and
taste
*NL*
could
compass
,
a
large
silken
pall
,
destined
to
cover
the
bier
of
*NL*
Athelstane
,
while
the
others
busied
themselves
in
selecting
,
from
*NL*
baskets
of
flowers
placed
before
them
,
garlands
,
which
they
intended
for
*NL*
the
same
mournful
purpose
.
The
behaviour
of
the
maidens
was
decorous
,
if
*NL*
not
marked
with
deep
affliction
;
but
now
and
then
a
whisper
or
a
smile
*NL*
called
forth
the
rebuke
of
the
severer
matrons
,
and
here
and
there
might
*NL*
be
seen
a
damsel
more
interested
in
endeavouring
to
find
out
how
her
*NL*
mourning-robe
became
her
,
than
in
the
dismal
ceremony
for
which
they
*NL*
were
preparing
.
Neither
was
this
propensity
-LRB-
if
we
must
needs
confess
*NL*
the
truth
-RRB-
at
all
diminished
by
the
appearance
of
two
strange
knights
,
*NL*
which
occasioned
some
looking
up
,
peeping
,
and
whispering
.
Rowena
alone
,
*NL*
too
proud
to
be
vain
,
paid
her
greeting
to
her
deliverer
with
a
graceful
*NL*
courtesy
.
Her
demeanour
was
serious
,
but
not
dejected
;
and
it
may
be
*NL*
doubted
whether
thoughts
of
Ivanhoe
,
and
of
the
uncertainty
of
his
*NL*
fate
,
did
not
claim
as
great
a
share
in
her
gravity
as
the
death
of
her
*NL*
kinsman
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
Cedric
,
however
,
who
,
as
we
have
observed
,
was
not
remarkably
*NL*
clear-sighted
on
such
occasions
,
the
sorrow
of
his
ward
seemed
so
*NL*
much
deeper
than
any
of
the
other
maidens
,
that
he
deemed
it
proper
*NL*
to
whisper
the
explanation
--
``
She
was
the
affianced
bride
of
the
noble
*NL*
Athelstane
.
''
--
It
may
be
doubted
whether
this
communication
went
a
far
*NL*
way
to
increase
Wilfred
's
disposition
to
sympathize
with
the
mourners
of
*NL*
Coningsburgh
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
thus
formally
introduced
the
guests
to
the
different
chambers
in
*NL*
which
the
obsequies
of
Athelstane
were
celebrated
under
different
forms
,
*NL*
Cedric
conducted
them
into
a
small
room
,
destined
,
as
he
informed
them
,
*NL*
for
the
exclusive
accomodation
of
honourable
guests
,
whose
more
slight
*NL*
connexion
with
the
deceased
might
render
them
unwilling
to
join
those
*NL*
who
were
immediately
effected
by
the
unhappy
event
.
He
assured
them
of
*NL*
every
accommodation
,
and
was
about
to
withdraw
when
the
Black
Knight
*NL*
took
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
crave
to
remind
you
,
noble
Thane
,
''
he
said
,
``
that
when
we
last
*NL*
parted
,
you
promised
,
for
the
service
I
had
the
fortune
to
render
you
,
*NL*
to
grant
me
a
boon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
granted
ere
named
,
noble
Knight
,
''
said
Cedric
;
``
yet
,
at
this
sad
*NL*
moment
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
that
also
,
''
said
the
King
,
``
I
have
bethought
me
--
but
my
time
is
*NL*
brief
--
neither
does
it
seem
to
me
unfit
,
that
,
when
closing
the
grave
on
*NL*
the
noble
Athelstane
,
we
should
deposit
therein
certain
prejudices
and
*NL*
hasty
opinions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
Knight
of
the
Fetterlock
,
''
said
Cedric
,
colouring
,
and
interrupting
*NL*
the
King
in
his
turn
,
``
I
trust
your
boon
regards
yourself
and
no
other
;
*NL*
for
in
that
which
concerns
the
honour
of
my
house
,
it
is
scarce
fitting
*NL*
that
a
stranger
should
mingle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
do
I
wish
to
mingle
,
''
said
the
King
,
mildly
,
``
unless
in
so
far
as
*NL*
you
will
admit
me
to
have
an
interest

As
yet
you
have
known
me
but
as
*NL*
the
Black
Knight
of
the
Fetterlock
--
Know
me
now
as
Richard
Plantagenet

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Richard
of
Anjou

''
exclaimed
Cedric
,
stepping
backward
with
the
utmost
*NL*
astonishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

noble
Cedric

Richard
of
England

hast
thou
no

*NL*
*NL*
``
To

said
Cedric
,
``
it

never

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Reserve

said
the

,
``

*NL*
``

answered
Cedric
,
``
I
have
ever
done
justice

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not
dispute
my
title
with

said
Richard
,
*NL*
calmly
;

*NL*
``

His
countenance
darkened
as

spoke

pointing
to

use

ancestry

no
short
cloaks

of

art
about

he
added

sternly

``

guess
the

him

much
the

closed

The
ghost

burst

stand
before

forbid
such
dishonour

memory

*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
as

raised
a
spectre

for
,
scarce
had

he
uttered
them
ere
the
door
flew
open
,
and
Athelstane
,
arrayed
in
*NL*
the
garments
of
the
grave
,
stood
before
them
,
pale
,
haggard
,
and
like
*NL*
something
arisen
from
the
dead
!

The
effect
of
this
apparition
on
the
persons
present
was
utterly
*NL*
appalling
.
Cedric
started
back
as
far
as
the
wall
of
the
apartment
would
*NL*
permit
,
and
,
leaning
against
it
as
one
unable
to
support
himself
,
gazed
*NL*
on
the
figure
of
his
friend
with
eyes
that
seemed
fixed
,
and
a
mouth
*NL*
which
he
appeared
incapable
of
shutting
.
Ivanhoe
crossed
himself
,
*NL*
repeating
prayers
in
Saxon
,
Latin
,
or
Norman-French
,
as
they
occurred
*NL*
to
his
memory
,
while
Richard
alternately
said
,
``
Benedicite
''
,
and
swore
,
*NL*
``
Mort
de
ma
vie
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
a
horrible
noise
was
heard
below
stairs
,
some
crying
,
*NL*
``
Secure
the
treacherous
monks
!
''
--
others
,
``
Down
with
them
into
the
*NL*
dungeon
!
''
--
others
,
``
Pitch
them
from
the
highest
battlements
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
name
of
God
!
''
said
Cedric
,
addressing
what
seemed
the
spectre
of
*NL*
his
departed
friend
,
``
if
thou
art
mortal
,
speak
!
--
if
a
departed
spirit
,
*NL*
say
for
what
cause
thou
dost
revisit
us
,
or
if
I
can
do
aught
that
can
*NL*
set
thy
spirit
at
repose
.
--
Living
or
dead
,
noble
Athelstane
,
speak
to
*NL*
Cedric
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
,
''
said
the
spectre
,
very
composedly
,
``
when
I
have
collected
*NL*
breath
,
and
when
you
give
me
time
--
Alive
,
saidst
thou
?
--
I
am
as
much
*NL*
alive
as
he
can
be
who
has
fed
on
bread
and
water
for
three
days
,
which
*NL*
seem
three
ages
--
Yes
,
bread
and
water
,
Father
Cedric
!
By
Heaven
,
and
all
*NL*
saints
in
it
,
better
food
hath
not
passed
my
weasand
for
three
livelong
*NL*
days
,
and
by
God
's
providence
it
is
that
I
am
now
here
to
tell
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
noble
Athelstane
,
''
said
the
Black
Knight
,
``
I
myself
saw
you
struck
*NL*
down
by
the
fierce
Templar
towards
the
end
of
the
storm
at
Torquilstone
,
*NL*
and
as
I
thought
,
and
Wamba
reported
,
your
skull
was
cloven
through
the
*NL*
teeth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
thought
amiss
,
Sir
Knight
,
''
said
Athelstane
,
``
and
Wamba
lied
.
My
*NL*
teeth
are
in
good
order
,
and
that
my
supper
shall
presently
find
--
No
*NL*
thanks
to
the
Templar
though
,
whose
sword
turned
in
his
hand
,
so
that
*NL*
the
blade
struck
me
flatlings
,
being
averted
by
the
handle
of
the
good
*NL*
mace
with
which
I
warded
the
blow
;
had
my
steel-cap
been
on
,
I
had
not
*NL*
valued
it
a
rush
,
and
had
dealt
him
such
a
counter-buff
as
would
have
*NL*
spoilt
his
retreat
.
But
as
it
was
,
down
I
went
,
stunned
,
indeed
,
but
*NL*
unwounded
.
Others
,
of
both
sides
,
were
beaten
down
and
slaughtered
*NL*
above
me
,
so
that
I
never
recovered
my
senses
until
I
found
myself
in
*NL*
a
coffin
--
-LRB-
an
open
one
,
by
good
luck
-RRB-
--
placed
before
the
altar
of
the
*NL*
church
of
Saint
Edmund
's
.
I
sneezed
repeatedly
--
groaned
--
awakened
and
*NL*
would
have
arisen
,
when
the
Sacristan
and
Abbot
,
full
of
terror
,
came
*NL*
running
at
the
noise
,
surprised
,
doubtless
,
and
no
way
pleased
to
find
*NL*
the
man
alive
,
whose
heirs
they
had
proposed
themselves
to
be
.
I
asked
*NL*
for
wine
--
they
gave
me
some
,
but
it
must
have
been
highly
medicated
,
for
*NL*
I
slept
yet
more
deeply
than
before
,
and
wakened
not
for
many
hours
.
I
*NL*
found
my
arms
swathed
down
--
my
feet
tied
so
fast
that
mine
ankles
ache
*NL*
at
the
very
remembrance
--
the
place
was
utterly
dark
--
the
oubliette
,
as
*NL*
I
suppose
,
of
their
accursed
convent
,
and
from
the
close
,
stifled
,
*NL*
damp
smell
,
I
conceive
it
is
also
used
for
a
place
of
sepulture
.
I
had
*NL*
strange
thoughts
of
what
had
befallen
me
,
when
the
door
of
my
dungeon
*NL*
creaked
,
and
two
villain
monks
entered
.
They
would
have
persuaded
me
I
*NL*
was
in
purgatory
,
but
I
knew
too
well
the
pursy
short-breathed
voice
of
*NL*
the
Father
Abbot
.
--
Saint
Jeremy
!
how
different
from
that
tone
with
which
*NL*
he
used
to
ask
me
for
another
slice
of
the
haunch
!
--
the
dog
has
feasted
*NL*
with
me
from
Christmas
to
Twelfth-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
patience
,
noble
Athelstane
,
''
said
the
King
,
``
take
breath
--
tell
*NL*
your
story
at
leisure
--
beshrew
me
but
such
a
tale
is
as
well
worth
*NL*
listening
to
as
a
romance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
but
,
by
the
rood
of
Bromeholm
,
there
was
no
romance
in
the
matter
!
''
*NL*
said
Athelstane
.
--
``
A
barley
loaf
and
a
pitcher
of
water
--
that
THEY
gave
*NL*
me
,
the
niggardly
traitors
,
whom
my
father
,
and
I
myself
,
had
enriched
,
*NL*
when
their
best
resources
were
the
flitches
of
bacon
and
measures
of
*NL*
corn
,
out
of
which
they
wheedled
poor
serfs
and
bondsmen
,
in
exchange
*NL*
for
their
prayers
--
the
nest
of
foul
ungrateful
vipers
--
barley
bread
and
*NL*
ditch
water
to
such
a
patron
as
I
had
been
!
I
will
smoke
them
out
of
*NL*
their
nest
,
though
I
be
excommunicated
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
in
the
name
of
Our
Lady
,
noble
Athelstane
,
''
said
Cedric
,
grasping
*NL*
the
hand
of
his
friend
,
``
how
didst
thou
escape
this
imminent
danger
--
did
*NL*
their
hearts
relent
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
their
hearts
relent
!
''
echoed
Athelstane
.
--
``
Do
rocks
melt
with
the
*NL*
sun
?
I
should
have
been
there
still
,
had
not
some
stir
in
the
Convent
,
*NL*
which
I
find
was
their
procession
hitherward
to
eat
my
funeral
feast
,
*NL*
when
they
well
knew
how
and
where
I
had
been
buried
alive
,
summoned
the
*NL*
swarm
out
of
their
hive
.
I
heard
them
droning
out
their
death-psalms
,
*NL*
little
judging
they
were
sung
in
respect
for
my
soul
by
those
who
*NL*
were
thus
famishing
my
body
.
They
went
,
however
,
and
I
waited
long
for
*NL*
food
--
no
wonder
--
the
gouty
Sacristan
was
even
too
busy
with
his
own
*NL*
provender
to
mind
mine
.
At
length
down
he
came
,
with
an
unstable
step
*NL*
and
a
strong
flavour
of
wine
and
spices
about
his
person
.
Good
cheer
had
*NL*
opened
his
heart
,
for
he
left
me
a
nook
of
pasty
and
a
flask
of
wine
,
*NL*
instead
of
my
former
fare
.
I
ate
,
drank
,
and
was
invigorated
;
when
,
to
*NL*
add
to
my
good
luck
,
the
Sacristan
,
too
totty
to
discharge
his
duty
of
*NL*
turnkey
fitly
,
locked
the
door
beside
the
staple
,
so
that
it
fell
ajar
.
*NL*
The
light
,
the
food
,
the
wine
,
set
my
invention
to
work
.
The
staple
to
*NL*
which
my
chains
were
fixed
,
was
more
rusted
than
I
or
the
villain
Abbot
*NL*
had
supposed
.
Even
iron
could
not
remain
without
consuming
in
the
damps
*NL*
of
that
infernal
dungeon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
breath
,
noble
Athelstane
,
''
said
Richard
,
``
and
partake
of
some
*NL*
refreshment

you
proceed
with
a
tale
so
dreadful

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Partake
!

quoth
Athelstane
;
``
I
have
been
partaking
five
times

to-day

yet
a
morsel

savoury
ham

altogether
foreign

to
the

I
pray

do

reason

*NL*
*NL*
The
guests
,
though
still
agape
with
astonishment
,
pledged
their
*NL*
resuscitated
landlord
,
who
thus
proceeded
in
his
story
:
--
He
had
indeed
*NL*
now
many
more
auditors
than
those
to
whom
it
was
commenced
,
for
Edith
,
*NL*
having
given
certain
necessary
orders
for
arranging
matters
within
*NL*
the
Castle
,
had
followed
the
dead-alive
up
to
the
stranger
's
apartment
*NL*
attended
by
as
many
of
the
guests
,
male
and
female
,
as
could
squeeze
*NL*
into
the
small
room
,
while
others
,
crowding
the
staircase
,
caught
up
*NL*
an
erroneous
edition
of
the
story
,
and
transmitted
it
still
more
*NL*
inaccurately
to
those
beneath
,
who
again
sent
it
forth
to
the
vulgar
*NL*
without
,
in
a
fashion
totally
irreconcilable
to
the
real
fact
.
*NL*
Athelstane
,
however
,
went
on
as
follows
,
with
the
history
of
his
*NL*
escape
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Finding
myself
freed
from
the
staple
,
I
dragged
myself
up
stairs
as
*NL*
well
as
a
man
loaded
with
shackles
,
and
emaciated
with
fasting
,
might
;
*NL*
and
after
much
groping
about
,
I
was
at
length
directed
,
by
the
sound
of
*NL*
a
jolly
roundelay
,
to
the
apartment
where
the
worthy
Sacristan
,
an
it
*NL*
so
please
ye
,
was
holding
a
devil
's
mass
with
a
huge
beetle-browed
,
*NL*
broad-shouldered
brother
of
the
grey-frock
and
cowl
,
who
looked
much
*NL*
more
like
a
thief
than
a
clergyman
.
I
burst
in
upon
them
,
and
the
*NL*
fashion
of
my
grave-clothes
,
as
well
as
the
clanking
of
my
chains
,
made
*NL*
me
more
resemble
an
inhabitant
of
the
other
world
than
of
this
.
Both
*NL*
stood
aghast
;
but
when
I
knocked
down
the
Sacristan
with
my
fist
,
*NL*
the
other
fellow
,
his
pot-companion
,
fetched
a
blow
at
me
with
a
huge
*NL*
quarter-staff
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
must
be
our
Friar
Tuck
,
for
a
count
's
ransom
,
''
said
Richard
,
*NL*
looking
at
Ivanhoe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
may
be
the
devil
,
an
he
will
,
''
said
Athelstane
.
``
Fortunately
he
*NL*
missed
the
aim
;
and
on
my
approaching
to
grapple
with
him
,
took
to
his
*NL*
heels
and
ran
for
it
.
I
failed
not
to
set
my
own
heels
at
liberty
by
*NL*
means
of
the
fetter-key
,
which
hung
amongst
others
at
the
sexton
's
belt
;
*NL*
and
I
had
thoughts
of
beating
out
the
knave
's
brains
with
the
bunch
of
*NL*
keys
,
but
gratitude
for
the
nook
of
pasty
and
the
flask
of
wine
which
*NL*
the
rascal
had
imparted
to
my
captivity
,
came
over
my
heart
;
so
,
with
a
*NL*
brace
of
hearty
kicks
,
I
left
him
on
the
floor
,
pouched
some
baked
meat
,
*NL*
and
a
leathern
bottle
of
wine
,
with
which
the
two
venerable
brethren
had
*NL*
been
regaling
,
went
to
the
stable
,
and
found
in
a
private
stall
mine
own
*NL*
best
palfrey
,
which
,
doubtless
,
had
been
set
apart
for
the
holy
Father
*NL*
Abbot
's
particular
use
.
Hither
I
came
with
all
the
speed
the
beast
could
*NL*
compass
--
man
and
mother
's
son
flying
before
me
wherever
I
came
,
*NL*
taking
me
for
a
spectre
,
the
more
especially
as
,
to
prevent
my
being
*NL*
recognised
,
I
drew
the
corpse-hood
over
my
face
.
I
had
not
gained
*NL*
admittance
into
my
own
castle
,
had
I
not
been
supposed
to
be
the
*NL*
attendant
of
a
juggler
who
is
making
the
people
in
the
castle-yard
*NL*
very
merry
,
considering
they
are
assembled
to
celebrate
their
lord
's
*NL*
funeral
--
I
say
the
sewer
thought
I
was
dressed
to
bear
a
part
in
the
*NL*
tregetour
's
mummery
,
and
so
I
got
admission
,
and
did
but
disclose
myself
*NL*
to
my
mother
,
and
eat
a
hasty
morsel
,
ere
I
came
in
quest
of
you
,
my
*NL*
noble
friend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
have
found

Cedric

``

``

Athelstane

``
a

your

bread

I
rise
from

I
descended

One
half
of

follies
were
puffed
into

you
may
now
judge
if
he
is
a
counsellor

Since

I
have
had
nothing

hurried
journeys

indigestions

blows

imprisonments

and
starvation
;
besides
that
they
can
only
end
in
the
murder

tell
you

will
be

*NL*
*NL*
All
now
looked
around
and
enquired
for
Ivanhoe
,
but
he
had
vanished

*NL*
It
was
at
length
discovered
that
a
Jew
had
been
to
seek
him
;
and
that
,
*NL*
after
very
brief
conference
,
he
had
called
for
Gurth
and
his
armour
,
and
*NL*
had
left
the
castle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fair
cousin

''
said
Athelstane
to
Rowena
,
``
could
I
think
that
this
*NL*
sudden

occasioned

than
the
*NL*
weightiest
reason

I
would
myself
resume

*NL*
*NL*
But
he
had
no
sooner
let
go
her
hand
,
on
first
observing
that
Ivanhoe
*NL*
had
disappeared
,
than
Rowena
,
who
had
found
her
situation
extremely
*NL*
embarrassing
,
had
taken
the
first
opportunity
to
escape
from
the
*NL*
apartment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

quoth
Athelstane

perhaps
a

*NL*
*NL*
But
King
Richard
was
gone
also
,
and
no
one
knew
whither
.
At
length
it
*NL*
was
learned
that
he
had
hastened
to
the
court-yard
,
summoned
to
his
*NL*
presence
the
Jew
who
had
spoken
with
Ivanhoe
,
and
after
a
moment
's
*NL*
speech
with
him
,
had
called
vehemently
to
horse
,
thrown
himself
upon
a
*NL*
steed
,
compelled
the
Jew
to
mount
another
,
and
set
off
at
a
rate
,
which
,
*NL*
according
to
Wamba
,
rendered
the
old
Jew
's
neck
not
worth
a
penny
's
*NL*
purchase
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
my
halidome
!

said
Athelstane
,
``
it
is
certain

Richard
II
*NL*
*NL*
Our
scene
now
returns
to
the
exterior
of
the
Castle
,
or
Preceptory
,
of
*NL*
Templestowe
,
about
the
hour
when
the
bloody
die
was
to
be
cast
for
the
*NL*
life
or
death
of
Rebecca
.
It
was
a
scene
of
bustle
and
life
,
as
if
the
*NL*
whole
vicinity
had
poured
forth
its
inhabitants
to
a
village
wake
,
or
*NL*
rural
feast
.
But
the
earnest
desire
to
look
on
blood
and
death
,
is
not
*NL*
peculiar
to
those
dark
ages
;
though
in
the
gladiatorial
exercise
of
*NL*
single
combat
and
general
tourney
,
they
were
habituated
to
the
bloody
*NL*
spectacle
of
brave
men
falling
by
each
other
's
hands
.
Even
in
our
own
*NL*
days
,
when
morals
are
better
understood
,
an
execution
,
a
bruising
match
,
*NL*
a
riot
,
or
a
meeting
of
radical
reformers
,
collects
,
at
considerable
*NL*
hazard
to
themselves
,
immense
crowds
of
spectators
,
otherwise
little
*NL*
interested
,
except
to
see
how
matters
are
to
be
conducted
,
or
whether
*NL*
the
heroes
of
the
day
are
,
in
the
heroic
language
of
insurgent
tailors
,
*NL*
flints
or
dunghills
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
eyes
,
therefore
,
of
a
very
considerable
multitude
,
were
bent
on
the
*NL*
gate
of
the
Preceptory
of
Templestowe
,
with
the
purpose
of
witnessing
*NL*
the
procession
;
while
still
greater
numbers
had
already
surrounded
the
*NL*
tiltyard
belonging
to
that
establishment
.
This
enclosure
was
formed
on
*NL*
a
piece
of
level
ground
adjoining
to
the
Preceptory
,
which
had
been
*NL*
levelled
with
care
,
for
the
exercise
of
military
and
chivalrous
sports
.
*NL*
It
occupied
the
brow
of
a
soft
and
gentle
eminence
,
was
carefully
*NL*
palisaded
around
,
and
,
as
the
Templars
willingly
invited
spectators
to
*NL*
be
witnesses
of
their
skill
in
feats
of
chivalry
,
was
amply
supplied
*NL*
with
galleries
and
benches
for
their
use
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
present
occasion
,
a
throne
was
erected
for
the
Grand
Master
at
*NL*
the
east
end
,
surrounded
with
seats
of
distinction
for
the
Preceptors
*NL*
and
Knights
of
the
Order
.
Over
these
floated
the
sacred
standard
,
called
*NL*
``
Le
Beau-seant
''
,
which
was
the
ensign
,
as
its
name
was
the
battle-cry
,
*NL*
of
the
Templars
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
opposite
end
of
the
lists
was
a
pile
of
faggots
,
so
arranged
*NL*
around
a
stake
,
deeply
fixed
in
the
ground
,
as
to
leave
a
space
for
the
*NL*
victim
whom
they
were
destined
to
consume
,
to
enter
within
the
fatal
*NL*
circle
,
in
order
to
be
chained
to
the
stake
by
the
fetters
which
hung
*NL*
ready
for
that
purpose
.
Beside
this
deadly
apparatus
stood
four
black
*NL*
slaves
,
whose
colour
and
African
features
,
then
so
little
known
in
*NL*
England
,
appalled
the
multitude
,
who
gazed
on
them
as
on
demons
employed
*NL*
about
their
own
diabolical
exercises
.
These
men
stirred
not
,
excepting
*NL*
now
and
then
,
under
the
direction
of
one
who
seemed
their
chief
,
to
*NL*
shift
and
replace
the
ready
fuel
.
They
looked
not
on
the
multitude
.
In
*NL*
fact
,
they
seemed
insensible
of
their
presence
,
and
of
every
thing
save
*NL*
the
discharge
of
their
own
horrible
duty
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
when
,
in
speech
with
each
other
,
they
expanded
their
blubber
lips
,
*NL*
and
showed
their
white
fangs
,
as
if
they
grinned
at
the
thoughts
of
the
*NL*
expected
tragedy
,
the
startled
commons
could
scarcely
help
believing
*NL*
that
they
were
actually
the
familiar
spirits
with
whom
the
witch
had
*NL*
communed
,
and
who
,
her
time
being
out
,
stood
ready
to
assist
in
her
*NL*
dreadful
punishment
.
They
whispered
to
each
other
,
and
communicated
all
*NL*
the
feats
which
Satan
had
performed
during
that
busy
and
unhappy
period
,
*NL*
not
failing
,
of
course
,
to
give
the
devil
rather
more
than
his
due
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
not
heard
,
Father
Dennet
,
''
quoth
one
boor
to
another
advanced
*NL*
in
years
,
``
that
the
devil
has
carried
away
bodily
the
great
Saxon
Thane
,
*NL*
Athelstane
of
Coningsburgh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
but
he
brought
him
back
though
,
by
the
blessing
of
God
and
Saint
*NL*
Dunstan
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
's
that
?
''
said
a
brisk
young
fellow
,
dressed
in
a
green
cassock
*NL*
embroidered
with
gold
,
and
having
at
his
heels
a
stout
lad
bearing
a
*NL*
harp
upon
his
back
,
which
betrayed
his
vocation
.
The
Minstrel
seemed
*NL*
of
no
vulgar
rank
;
for
,
besides
the
splendour
of
his
gaily
braidered
*NL*
doublet
,
he
wore
around
his
neck
a
silver
chain
,
by
which
hung
the
*NL*
``
wrest
''
,
or
key
,
with
which
he
tuned
his
harp
.
On
his
right
arm
was
a
*NL*
silver
plate
,
which
,
instead
of
bearing
,
as
usual
,
the
cognizance
or
*NL*
badge
of
the
baron
to
whose
family
he
belonged
,
had
barely
the
word
*NL*
SHERWOOD
engraved
upon
it
.
--
``
How
mean
you
by
that
?
''
said
the
gay
*NL*
Minstrel
,
mingling
in
the
conversation
of
the
peasants
;
``
I
came
to
seek
*NL*
one
subject
for
my
rhyme
,
and

by

Lady
,
I
were
glad
to
find
two

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
well
avouched

said
the
elder
peasant
,
``
that

Coningsburgh
had
been
dead
four
weeks

*NL*
*NL*
``
That

impossible

said
the
Minstrel
;
``
I
saw

*NL*
*NL*
``
Dead

the
younger
peasant

moreover

there
was

*NL*
*NL*
``

the
old

shaking
his
head

*NL*
*NL*
``
But

somewhat

impatiently

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay

said
a
burly
Friar
,
who
stood
beside
*NL*
them
,
leaning
on
a
pole
that
exhibited
an
appearance
between
a
pilgrim
's
*NL*
staff
and
a
quarter-staff
,
and
probably
acted
as
either
when
occasion
*NL*
served
,

``

said
the
stalwart
churchman
;

*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
That

a

said
the

said
Dennet
,
*NL*
turning
sulky
at
these
repeated
contradictions
;
and
it
was
with
some
*NL*
difficulty
that
the
boor
could
be
prevailed
on
,
by
the
request
of
*NL*
his
comrade
and
the
Minstrel
,
to
renew
his
tale

--
``
These

he
at
length
,
``
since

were

deep
groan

a
clanking
of
chains

the
figure
of

deceased

saying

*NL*

drawing
him
apart

He
had
his

shroud
on

all
about

smelt
of

*NL*
*NL*

the

*NL*
*NL*
``
By
Saint

said
the
Minstrel

it

*NL*
*NL*
``

Friar

No

no

I
instantly
formed
the
purpose
of
assisting
at
some
*NL*
good
work
,
such
as
the
burning
of
a
witch
,
a
judicial
combat
,
or
the
*NL*
like
matter
of
godly
service
,
and
therefore
am
I
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
thus
conversed
,
the
heavy
bell
of
the
church
of
Saint
Michael
of
*NL*
Templestowe
,
a
venerable
building
,
situated
in
a
hamlet
at
some
distance
*NL*
from
the
Preceptory
,
broke
short
their
argument
.
One
by
one
the
sullen
*NL*
sounds
fell
successively
on
the
ear
,
leaving
but
sufficient
space
*NL*
for
each
to
die
away
in
distant
echo
,
ere
the
air
was
again
filled
*NL*
by
repetition
of
the
iron
knell
.
These
sounds
,
the
signal
of
the
*NL*
approaching
ceremony
,
chilled
with
awe
the
hearts
of
the
assembled
*NL*
multitude
,
whose
eyes
were
now
turned
to
the
Preceptory
,
expecting
the
*NL*
approach
of
the
Grand
Master
,
the
champion
,
and
the
criminal
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
the
drawbridge
fell
,
the
gates
opened
,
and
a
knight
,
bearing
*NL*
the
great
standard
of
the
Order
,
sallied
from
the
castle
,
preceded
by
*NL*
six
trumpets
,
and
followed
by
the
Knights
Preceptors
,
two
and
two
,
the
*NL*
Grand
Master
coming
last
,
mounted
on
a
stately
horse
,
whose
furniture
*NL*
was
of
the
simplest
kind
.
Behind
him
came
Brian
de
Bois-Guilbert
,
armed
*NL*
cap-a-pie
in
bright
armour
,
but
without
his
lance
,
shield
,
and
sword
,
*NL*
which
were
borne
by
his
two
esquires
behind
him
.
His
face
,
though
partly
*NL*
hidden
by
a
long
plume
which
floated
down
from
his
barrel-cap
,
bore
*NL*
a
strong
and
mingled
expression
of
passion
,
in
which
pride
seemed
to
*NL*
contend
with
irresolution
.
He
looked
ghastly
pale
,
as
if
he
had
not
*NL*
slept
for
several
nights
,
yet
reined
his
pawing
war-horse
with
the
*NL*
habitual
ease
and
grace
proper
to
the
best
lance
of
the
Order
of
the
*NL*
Temple
.
His
general
appearance
was
grand
and
commanding
;
but
,
looking
at
*NL*
him
with
attention
,
men
read
that
in
his
dark
features
,
from
which
they
*NL*
willingly
withdrew
their
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
either
side
rode
Conrade
of
Mont-Fitchet
,
and
Albert
de
Malvoisin
,
*NL*
who
acted
as
godfathers
to
the
champion
.
They
were
in
their
robes
*NL*
of
peace
,
the
white
dress
of
the
Order
.
Behind
them
followed
other
*NL*
Companions
of
the
Temple
,
with
a
long
train
of
esquires
and
pages
clad
*NL*
in
black
,
aspirants
to
the
honour
of
being
one
day
Knights
of
the
Order
.
*NL*
After
these
neophytes
came
a
guard
of
warders
on
foot
,
in
the
same
*NL*
sable
livery
,
amidst
whose
partisans
might
be
seen
the
pale
form
of
the
*NL*
accused
,
moving
with
a
slow
but
undismayed
step
towards
the
scene
of
her
*NL*
fate
.
She
was
stript
of
all
her
ornaments
,
lest
perchance
there
should
*NL*
be
among
them
some
of
those
amulets
which
Satan
was
supposed
to
bestow
*NL*
upon
his
victims
,
to
deprive
them
of
the
power
of
confession
even
when
*NL*
under
the
torture
.
A
coarse
white
dress
,
of
the
simplest
form
,
had
been
*NL*
substituted
for
her
Oriental
garments
;
yet
there
was
such
an
exquisite
*NL*
mixture
of
courage
and
resignation
in
her
look
,
that
even
in
this
garb
,
*NL*
and
with
no
other
ornament
than
her
long
black
tresses
,
each
eye
wept
*NL*
that
looked
upon
her
,
and
the
most
hardened
bigot
regretted
the
fate
*NL*
that
had
converted
a
creature
so
goodly
into
a
vessel
of
wrath
,
and
a
*NL*
waged
slave
of
the
devil
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
crowd
of
inferior
personages
belonging
to
the
Preceptory
followed
the
*NL*
victim
,
all
moving
with
the
utmost
order
,
with
arms
folded
,
and
looks
*NL*
bent
upon
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
slow
procession
moved
up
the
gentle
eminence
,
on
the
summit
of
*NL*
which
was
the
tiltyard
,
and
,
entering
the
lists
,
marched
once
around
*NL*
them
from
right
to
left
,
and
when
they
had
completed
the
circle
,
made
a
*NL*
halt
.
There
was
then
a
momentary
bustle
,
while
the
Grand
Master
and
all
*NL*
his
attendants
,
excepting
the
champion
and
his
godfathers
,
dismounted
*NL*
from
their
horses
,
which
were
immediately
removed
out
of
the
lists
by
*NL*
the
esquires
,
who
were
in
attendance
for
that
purpose
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
unfortunate
Rebecca
was
conducted
to
the
black
chair
placed
near
the
*NL*
pile
.
On
her
first
glance
at
the
terrible
spot
where
preparations
were
*NL*
making
for
a
death
alike
dismaying
to
the
mind
and
painful
to
the
*NL*
body
,
she
was
observed
to
shudder
and
shut
her
eyes
,
praying
internally
*NL*
doubtless
,
for
her
lips
moved
though
no
speech
was
heard
.
In
the
space
*NL*
of
a
minute
she
opened
her
eyes
,
looked
fixedly
on
the
pile
as
if
to
*NL*
familiarize
her
mind
with
the
object
,
and
then
slowly
and
naturally
*NL*
turned
away
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
the
Grand
Master
had
assumed
his
seat
;
and
when
the
chivalry
*NL*
of
his
order
was
placed
around
and
behind
him
,
each
in
his
due
rank
,
*NL*
a
loud
and
long
flourish
of
the
trumpets
announced
that
the
Court
*NL*
were
seated
for
judgment
.
Malvoisin
,
then
,
acting
as
godfather
of
the
*NL*
champion
,
stepped
forward
,
and
laid
the
glove
of
the
Jewess
,
which
was
*NL*
the
pledge
of
battle
,
at
the
feet
of
the
Grand
Master
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Valorous
Lord
,
and
reverend
Father
,
''
said
he
,
``
here
standeth
the
good
*NL*
Knight
,
Brian
de
Bois-Guilbert
,
Knight
Preceptor
of
the
Order
of
the
*NL*
Temple
,
who
,
by
accepting
the
pledge
of
battle
which
I
now
lay
at
your
*NL*
reverence
's
feet
,
hath
become
bound
to
do
his
devoir
in
combat
this
*NL*
day
,
to
maintain
that
this
Jewish
maiden
,
by
name
Rebecca
,
hath
justly
*NL*
deserved
the
doom
passed
upon
her
in
a
Chapter
of
this
most
Holy
Order
*NL*
of
the
Temple
of
Zion
,
condemning
her
to
die
as
a
sorceress
;
--
here
,
I
*NL*
say
,
he
standeth
,
such
battle
to
do
,
knightly
and
honourable
,
if
such
be
*NL*
your
noble
and
sanctified
pleasure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hath
he
made
oath
,
''
said
the
Grand
Master
,
``
that
his
quarrel
is
just
*NL*
and
honourable
?
Bring
forward
the
Crucifix
and
the
`
Te
igitur

.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
and
most
reverend
father
,
''
answered
Malvoisin
,
readily
,
``
our
*NL*
brother
here
present
hath
already
sworn
to
the
truth
of
his
accusation
*NL*
in
the
hand
of
the
good
Knight
Conrade
de
Mont-Fitchet
;
and
otherwise
he
*NL*
ought
not
to
be
sworn
,
seeing
that
his
adversary
is
an
unbeliever
,
and
*NL*
may
take
no
oath
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
explanation
was
satisfactory
,
to
Albert
's
great
joy
;
for
the
wily
*NL*
knight
had
foreseen
the
great
difficulty
,
or
rather
impossibility
,
of
*NL*
prevailing
upon
Brian
de
Bois-Guilbert
to
take
such
an
oath
before
the
*NL*
assembly
,
and
had
invented
this
excuse
to
escape
the
necessity
of
his
*NL*
doing
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Grand
Master
,
having
allowed
the
apology
of
Albert
Malvoisin
,
*NL*
commanded
the
herald
to
stand
forth
and
do
his
devoir
.
The
trumpets
*NL*
then
again
flourished
,
and
a
herald
,
stepping
forward
,
proclaimed
*NL*
aloud
,
--
``
Oyez
,
oyez
,
oyez
.
--
Here
standeth
the
good
Knight
,
Sir
Brian
*NL*
de
Bois-Guilbert
,
ready
to
do
battle
with
any
knight
of
free
blood
,
who
*NL*
will
sustain
the
quarrel
allowed
and
allotted
to
the
Jewess
Rebecca
,
to
*NL*
try
by
champion
,
in
respect
of
lawful
essoine
of
her
own
body
;
and
to
*NL*
such
champion
the
reverend
and
valorous
Grand
Master
here
present
allows
*NL*
a
fair
field
,
and
equal
partition
of
sun
and
wind
,
and
whatever
else
*NL*
appertains
to
a
fair
combat
.
''
The
trumpets
again
sounded
,
and
there
was
*NL*
a
dead
pause
of
many
minutes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
champion
appears
for
the
appellant
,
''
said
the
Grand
Master
.
``
Go

and
ask
her
whether
she
expects
any
one
to
do
battle
for

this
her
cause
.
''
The
herald
went
to
the
chair
in
which
Rebecca
was
*NL*
seated
,
and
Bois-Guilbert
suddenly
turning
his
horse
's
head
toward
that
*NL*
end
of
the
lists
,
in
spite
of
hints
on
either
side
from
Malvoisin
and
*NL*
Mont-Fitchet
,
was
by
the
side
of
Rebecca
's
chair
as
soon
as
the
herald
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
this
regular
,
and
according
to
the
law
of
combat
?
''
said
Malvoisin
,
*NL*
looking
to
the
Grand
Master
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Albert
de
Malvoisin
,
it
is
,
''
answered
Beaumanoir
;
``
for
in
this
appeal
*NL*
to
the
judgment
of
God
,
we
may
not
prohibit
parties
from
having
that
*NL*
communication
with
each
other
,
which
may
best
tend
to
bring
forth
the
*NL*
truth
of
the
quarrel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
the
herald
spoke
to
Rebecca
in
these
terms
:
--
``
Damsel
,
*NL*
the
Honourable
and
Reverend
the
Grand
Master
demands
of
thee
,
if
thou
*NL*
art
prepared
with
a
champion
to
do
battle
this
day
in
thy
behalf
,
or
if
*NL*
thou
dost
yield
thee
as
one
justly
condemned
to
a
deserved
doom
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
to
the
Grand
Master
,
''
replied
Rebecca
,
``
that
I
maintain
my
*NL*
innocence
,
and
do
not
yield
me
as
justly
condemned
,
lest
I
become
guilty
*NL*
of
mine
own
blood
.
Say
to
him
,
that
I
challenge
such
delay
as
his
forms
*NL*
will
permit
,
to
see
if
God
,
whose
opportunity
is
in
man
's
extremity
,
*NL*
will
raise
me
up
a
deliverer
;
and
when
such
uttermost
space
is
passed
,
*NL*
may
His
holy
will
be
done
!
''
The
herald
retired
to
carry
this
answer
to
*NL*
the
Grand
Master
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
forbid
,
''
said
Lucas
Beaumanoir
,
``
that
Jew
or
Pagan
should
impeach
*NL*
us
of
injustice
!
--
Until
the
shadows
be
cast
from
the
west
to
the
*NL*
eastward
,
will
we
wait
to
see
if
a
champion
shall
appear
for
this
*NL*
unfortunate
woman
.
When
the
day
is
so
far
passed
,
let
her
prepare
for
*NL*
death
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
herald
communicated
the
words
of
the
Grand
Master
to
Rebecca
,
who
*NL*
bowed
her
head
submissively
,
folded
her
arms
,
and
,
looking
up
towards
*NL*
heaven
,
seemed
to
expect
that
aid
from
above
which
she
could
scarce
*NL*
promise
herself
from
man
.
During
this
awful
pause
,
the
voice
of
*NL*
Bois-Guilbert
broke
upon
her
ear
--
it
was
but
a
whisper
,
yet
it
startled
*NL*
her
more
than
the
summons
of
the
herald
had
appeared
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rebecca
,
''
said
the
Templar
,
``
dost
thou
hear
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
portion
in
thee

said
the
*NL*
unfortunate
maiden
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
but
dost
thou
understand
my
words
?
''
said
the
Templar
;
``
for
the
*NL*
sound
of
my
voice

frightful
in
mine
own

I
scarce
know
on

ground
we
stand

for
what
purpose
they
have
brought
us
hither

This
*NL*
listed
space

that
chair

these
faggots

I
know
their
purpose
,
and
yet
*NL*
it
appears
to
me
like
something
unreal

the
fearful
picture
of
a
vision
,
*NL*
which
appals
my
sense
with
hideous
fantasies

convinces
not
my
*NL*
reason

*NL*
*NL*
``
My
mind

keep
touch

time

answered
Rebecca
,
``
and
tell
*NL*
me
alike
that
these
faggots

destined
to
consume
my

a
painful

a
brief
passage
to
a
better

*NL*
*NL*
``
Dreams

answered
the
Templar
;
``
idle
visions

*NL*
rejected
by
the
wisdom

wiser
Sadducees

Hear
me

*NL*
he
said
,
proceeding
with
animation
;
``
a

thou

on
my
steed

on
Zamor

the
gallant
horse

never

won
him

*NL*
*NL*
Albert
Malvoisin
,
alarmed
and
impatient
at
the
duration
of
their
*NL*
conference
,
now
advanced
to
interrupt
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hath
the
maiden
acknowledged
her
guilt

he
demanded
of
Bois-Guilbert
;
*NL*
``
or
is
she
resolute
in
her
denial
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
indeed
resolute

said
Bois-Guilbert
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then

''
said
Malvoisin
,
``
must
thou

thy

Come

holy
Order

*NL*
soon
to
be
its

*NL*
*NL*
As
he
spoke
in
this
soothing
tone
,
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
knight
's
*NL*
bridle
,
as
if
to
lead
him
back
to
his
station
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
False
villain
!
what
meanest
thou
by
thy
hand
on
my
rein
?
''
said
Sir
*NL*
Brian
,
angrily
.
And
shaking
off
his
companion
's
grasp
,
he
rode
back
to
*NL*
the
upper
end
of
the
lists
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
yet
spirit
in
him

said
Malvoisin
apart
to
Mont-Fitchet
,
*NL*
``
were
it
well
directed

,
like
the
Greek
fire

it
burns
whatever
*NL*
approaches
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Judges
had
now
been
two
hours
in
the
lists
,
awaiting
in
vain
the
*NL*
appearance
of
a
champion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
reason
good
,
''
said
Friar
Tuck
,
``
seeing
she
is
a
Jewess
--
and
yet
,
*NL*
by
mine
Order
,
it
is
hard
that
so
young
and
beautiful
a
creature
should
*NL*
perish
without
one
blow
being
struck
in
her
behalf
!
Were
she
ten
times
*NL*
a
witch
,
provided
she
were
but
the
least
bit
of
a
Christian
,
my
*NL*
quarter-staff
should
ring
noon
on
the
steel
cap
of
yonder
fierce
*NL*
Templar
,
ere
he
carried
the
matter
off
thus
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
,
however
,
the
general
belief
that
no
one
could
or
would
appear
*NL*
for
a
Jewess
,
accused
of
sorcery
;
and
the
knights
,
instigated
by
*NL*
Malvoisin
,
whispered
to
each
other
,
that
it
was
time
to
declare
the
*NL*
pledge
of
Rebecca
forfeited
.
At
this
instant
a
knight
,
urging
his
horse
*NL*
to
speed
,
appeared
on
the
plain
advancing
towards
the
lists
.
A
*NL*
hundred
voices
exclaimed
,
``
A
champion
!
a
champion
!
''
And
despite
the
*NL*
prepossessions
and
prejudices
of
the
multitude
,
they
shouted
unanimously
*NL*
as
the
knight
rode
into
the
tiltyard
.
The
second
glance
,
however
,
served
*NL*
to
destroy
the
hope
that
his
timely
arrival
had
excited
.
His
horse
,
*NL*
urged
for
many
miles
to
its
utmost
speed
,
appeared
to
reel
from
fatigue
,
*NL*
and
the
rider
,
however
undauntedly
he
presented
himself
in
the
lists
,
*NL*
either
from
weakness
,
weariness
,
or
both
,
seemed
scarce
able
to
support
*NL*
himself
in
the
saddle
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
the
summons
of
the
herald
,
who
demanded
his
rank
,
his
name
,
and
*NL*
purpose
,
the
stranger
knight
answered
readily
and
boldly
,
``
I
am
a
good
*NL*
knight

noble

hither
to
sustain
with
lance
and

and
lawful
quarrel
of
this
damsel

Rebecca

daughter
of
Isaac
of
York
;
*NL*
to
uphold
the
doom
pronounced
against
her
to
be
false
and
truthless
,
and
*NL*
to
defy
Sir
Brian
de
Bois-Guilbert
,
as
a
traitor
,
murderer
,
and
liar
;
as
*NL*
I
will
prove
in
this
field
with
my
body
against
his

by
the
aid
of
God

*NL*
of
Our
Lady

of
Monseigneur
Saint
George

the
good
knight

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
stranger
must
first
show
,

said
Malvoisin
,
``
that

*NL*
*NL*
``

raising
his

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not
fight
with
thee
at

said
the
Templar
,
in
a
changed
*NL*
and
hollow
voice
.
``
Get
thy
wounds
healed

purvey
thee

out

boyish
spirit

bravado

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha

said
Ivanhoe
,
``
hast
thou
forgotten
that
twice
didst

thou

Passage

''
*NL*
*NL*
Bois-Guilbert
turned
his
countenance
irresolutely
towards
Rebecca
,
and
*NL*
then
exclaimed
,
looking
fiercely
at
Ivanhoe
,
``
Dog
of

Saxon

take
thy

prepare
for

*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
the
Grand

allow
me
the
combat

said
Ivanhoe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
may
not
deny
what
thou
hast
challenged

said
the
Grand

*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Thus

thus
as
I
am

not
otherwise

said
Ivanhoe
;
``
it
is

*NL*
judgment

Rebecca

said
he
,
*NL*
riding
up
to
the
fatal
chair
,
``
dost

accept
of
me

thy

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

she
said
--
``
I

fluttered
by
an
emotion
which
the
fear
of
*NL*
death
had
been
unable
to
produce
,
``
I
do
accept
thee

Heaven

Yet

no

no

uncured

Meet

proud
man

why

perish
also

''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Ivanhoe
was
already
at
his
post
,
and
had
closed
his
visor
,
and
*NL*
assumed
his
lance
.
Bois-Guilbert
did
the
same
;
and
his
esquire
remarked
,
*NL*
as
he
clasped
his
visor
,
that
his
face
,
which
had
,
notwithstanding
the
*NL*
variety
of
emotions
by
which
he
had
been
agitated
,
continued
during
the
*NL*
whole
morning
of
an
ashy
paleness
,
was
now
become
suddenly
very
much
*NL*
flushed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
herald
,
then
,
seeing
each
champion
in
his
place
,
uplifted
his
voice
,
*NL*
repeating
thrice
--
``
Faites
vos
devoirs
,
preux
chevaliers
!
''
After
the
*NL*
third
cry
,
he
withdrew
to
one
side
of
the
lists
,
and
again
proclaimed
,
*NL*
that
none
,
on
peril
of
instant
death
,
should
dare
,
by
word
,
cry
,
or
*NL*
action
,
to
interfere
with
or
disturb
this
fair
field
of
combat
.
The
*NL*
Grand
Master
,
who
held
in
his
hand
the
gage
of
battle
,
Rebecca
's
glove
,
*NL*
now
threw
it
into
the
lists
,
and
pronounced
the
fatal
signal
words
,
*NL*
``
Laissez
aller
''
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
trumpets
sounded
,
and
the
knights
charged
each
other
in
full
career
.
*NL*
The
wearied
horse
of
Ivanhoe
,
and
its
no
less
exhausted
rider
,
went
*NL*
down
,
as
all
had
expected
,
before
the
well-aimed
lance
and
vigorous
*NL*
steed
of
the
Templar
.
This
issue
of
the
combat
all
had
foreseen
;
but
*NL*
although
the
spear
of
Ivanhoe
did
but
,
in
comparison
,
touch
the
shield
*NL*
of
Bois-Guilbert
,
that
champion
,
to
the
astonishment
of
all
who
beheld
*NL*
it
reeled
in
his
saddle
,
lost
his
stirrups
,
and
fell
in
the
lists
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ivanhoe
,
extricating
himself
from
his
fallen
horse
,
was
soon
on
foot
,
*NL*
hastening
to
mend
his
fortune
with
his
sword
;
but
his
antagonist
arose
*NL*
not
.
Wilfred
,
placing
his
foot
on
his
breast
,
and
the
sword
's
point
*NL*
to
his
throat
,
commanded
him
to
yield
him
,
or
die
on
the
spot
.
*NL*
Bois-Guilbert
returned
no
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Slay
him
not
,
Sir
Knight
,
''
cried
the
Grand
Master
,
``
unshriven
and
*NL*
unabsolved
--
kill
not
body
and
soul
!
We
allow
him
vanquished
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
descended
into
the
lists
,
and
commanded
them
to
unhelm
the
conquered
*NL*
champion
.
His
eyes
were
closed
--
the
dark
red
flush
was
still
on
his
*NL*
brow
.
As
they
looked
on
him
in
astonishment
,
the
eyes
opened
--
but
they
*NL*
were
fixed
and
glazed
.
The
flush
passed
from
his
brow
,
and
gave
way
to
*NL*
the
pallid
hue
of
death
.
Unscathed
by
the
lance
of
his
enemy
,
he
had
*NL*
died
a
victim
to
the
violence
of
his
own
contending
passions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
indeed
the
judgment
of
God
,
''
said
the
Grand
Master
,
looking
*NL*
upwards

CHAPTER
XLIV

*NL*
So
!
now
't
is
ended

like
an
old
wife

story

*NL*
Webster
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
first
moments
of
surprise
were
over
,
Wilfred
of
Ivanhoe
*NL*
demanded
of
the
Grand
Master
,
as
judge
of
the
field
,
if
he
had
manfully
*NL*
and
rightfully
done
his
duty
in
the
combat
?
``
Manfully
and
rightfully
hath
*NL*
it
been
done
,
''
said
the
Grand
Master
.
``
I
pronounce
the
maiden
free
and
*NL*
guiltless
--
The
arms
and
the
body
of
the
deceased
knight

at
the
will
*NL*
of
the
victor

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not
despoil
him
of
his
weapons

said
the
Knight
of
Ivanhoe
,
*NL*
``

condemn
his
corpse
to
shame

he
hath
fought
for
Christendom

God
's

arm

hand

hath
this
day
struck
him
down
.
But
let
his
*NL*
obsequies
be
private
,
as
becomes
those
of
a
man
who
died
in
an
unjust
*NL*
quarrel

And
for
the
maiden

*NL*
*NL*
He
was
interrupted
by
a
clattering
of
horses

feet
,
advancing
in
such
*NL*
numbers
,
and
so
rapidly
,
as
to
shake
the
ground
before
them
;
and
the
*NL*
Black
Knight
galloped
into
the
lists
.
He
was
followed
by
a
numerous
band
*NL*
of
men-at-arms
,
and
several
knights
in
complete
armour
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
too
late

he
said
,
looking
around
him
.
``
I
had
doomed

Bois-Guilbert

mine

well

thee

*NL*
*NL*
``

Ivanhoe

``

Richard

steadfastly
on
the
corpse

A

stepped
forward
from
the

attendants

*NL*
The
Grand
Master
had
hitherto
stood
astonished
at
the
appearance
of
so
*NL*
many
warriors
.
--
He
now
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who

*NL*
*NL*

the

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Grand
Master
spoke
with
a
dignity
which
confronted
even
that
of
*NL*
England
's
king
himself
,
and
inspired
courage
into
his
surprised
and
*NL*
dismayed
followers
.
They
gathered
around
him
like
the
sheep
around
the
*NL*
watch-dog
,
when
they
hear
the
baying
of
the
wolf
.
But
they
evinced
not
*NL*
the
timidity
of
the
scared
flock
--
there
were
dark
brows
of
defiance
,
and
*NL*
looks
which
menaced
the
hostility
they
dared
not
to
proffer
in
words
.
*NL*
They
drew
together
in
a
dark
line
of
spears
,
from
which
the
white
cloaks
*NL*
of
the
knights
were
visible
among
the
dusky
garments
of
their
retainers
,
*NL*
like
the
lighter-coloured
edges
of
a
sable
cloud
.
The
multitude
,
who
had
*NL*
raised
a
clamorous
shout
of
reprobation
,
paused
and
gazed
in
silence
*NL*
on
the
formidable
and
experienced
body
to
which
they
had
unwarily
bade
*NL*
defiance
,
and
shrunk
back
from
their
front
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Earl
of
Essex
,
when
he
beheld
them
pause
in
their
assembled
force
,
*NL*
dashed
the
rowels
into
his
charger
's
sides
,
and
galloped
backwards
and
*NL*
forwards
to
array
his
followers
,
in
opposition
to
a
band
so
formidable
.
*NL*
Richard
alone
,
as
if
he
loved
the
danger
his
presence
had
provoked
,
*NL*
rode
slowly
along
the
front
of
the
Templars
,
calling
aloud
,
``
What
,
sirs
!
*NL*
Among
so
many
gallant
knights

will
none
dare
splinter
a
spear
with

?
--
Sirs
of
the
Temple
!
your

are

sun-burned

not
worth
the
shiver
of
a
broken
lance
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Brethren
of
the
Temple
,
''
said
the
Grand
Master
,
riding
forward
in
*NL*
advance
of
their
body
,
``
fight
not
on
such
idle
and
profane
quarrel

and
*NL*
not

shall
a
Templar
cross
lance
in
my
*NL*
presence

The
Pope

Princes
of
Europe
shall
judge
our
quarrel

*NL*
whether
a
Christian
prince
has
done
well
in
bucklering
the
cause

thou

to-day
adopted

If
unassailed

thine

we
lay
the
scandal

offence
*NL*
thou
hast
this
day
given
to
Christendom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
words
,
and
without
waiting
a
reply
,
the
Grand
Master
gave
the
*NL*
signal
of
departure
.
Their
trumpets
sounded
a
wild
march
,
of
an
Oriental
*NL*
character
,
which
formed
the
usual
signal
for
the
Templars
to
advance
.
*NL*
They
changed
their
array
from
a
line
to
a
column
of
march
,
and
moved
off
*NL*
as
slowly
as
their
horses
could
step
,
as
if
to
show
it
was
only
the
will
*NL*
of
their
Grand
Master
,
and
no
fear
of
the
opposing
and
superior
force
,
*NL*
which
compelled
them
to
withdraw
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
splendour
of
Our
Lady
's
brow
!
''
said
King
Richard
,
``
it
is
pity
*NL*
of
their
lives
that
these
Templars
are
not
so
trusty
as
they
are
*NL*
disciplined

valiant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
multitude
,
like
a
timid
cur
which
waits
to
bark
till
the
object
of
*NL*
its
challenge
has
turned
his
back
,
raised
a
feeble
shout
as
the
rear
of
*NL*
the
squadron
left
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
tumult
which
attended
the
retreat
of
the
Templars
,
Rebecca
*NL*
saw
and
heard
nothing
--
she
was
locked
in
the
arms
of
her
aged
father
,
*NL*
giddy
,
and
almost
senseless
,
with
the
rapid
change
of
circumstances
*NL*
around
her
.
But
one
word
from
Isaac
at
length
recalled
her
scattered
*NL*
feelings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
go
,

he
said
,
``
my

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

Rebecca

*NL*

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
And
hurrying
his
daughter
in
his
turn
,
he
conducted
her
from
the
lists
,
*NL*
and
by
means
of
conveyance
which
he
had
provided
,
transported
her
safely
*NL*
to
the
house
of
the
Rabbi
Nathan

*NL*
*NL*
The
Jewess
,
whose
fortunes
had
formed
the
principal
interest
of
the
*NL*
day
,
having
now
retired
unobserved
,
the
attention
of
the
populace
was
*NL*
transferred
to
the
Black
Knight
.
They
now
filled
the
air
with
``
Long
life

Richard

the
Lion
's
Heart
,
and
down
with

usurping

*NL*
``
Notwithstanding

Ivanhoe
to

The
Earl
smiled
and
shook
his
head

Essex

was
drawing
towards

York
having
heard
that
Prince
John
was
making
head
there

when
I
met
*NL*
King

like

true
knight-errant

galloping
hither

achieve
in

his
own
person
this
adventure

with

his

arm

accompanied
him

almost
maugre
his

consent

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
news
from
York
,
brave
Earl

said
Ivanhoe
;

will
the

bide

there

*NL*
*NL*
``
No
more
than
December

snow
will
bide

said
the
Earl
;
*NL*
``
they
are
dispersing
;
and
who
should
come
posting
to
bring
us
the

but

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The

Ivanhoe

did
not

into
confinement

*NL*
*NL*
``
O
!
he
received

answered
the
Earl
,
``
as
if
they
had
met
after

and

pointing
to

said
,

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
this
was
all
he
said

enquired
Ivanhoe
;
``
would
not
any

that
this
Prince
invites
men
to
treason
by
his
clemency

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
,

replied
the
Earl
,
``
as
the
man
may
be
said

invite
death

undertakes
to

wound
unhealed

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
forgive
thee

Lord

said
Ivanhoe
;
``
but

remember

I

hazarded

my

welfare

*NL*
*NL*
``
Those

replied
Essex
,
``
who
are
specially
careless
of

are
seldom
remarkably
attentive

But
let
*NL*
us
haste
to
the
castle
,
for
Richard
meditates
punishing
some
of
the
*NL*
subordinate
members
of
the
conspiracy
,
though
he
has
pardoned
their
*NL*
principal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
judicial
investigations
which
followed
on
this
occasion
,
and
*NL*
which
are
given
at
length
in
the
Wardour
Manuscript
,
it
appears
that
*NL*
Maurice
de
Bracy
escaped
beyond
seas
,
and
went
into
the
service
of
*NL*
Philip
of
France
;
while
Philip
de
Malvoisin
,
and
his
brother
Albert
,
the
*NL*
Preceptor
of
Templestowe
,
were
executed
,
although
Waldemar
Fitzurse
,
the
*NL*
soul
of
the
conspiracy
,
escaped
with
banishment
;
and
Prince
John
,
*NL*
for
whose
behoof
it
was
undertaken
,
was
not
even
censured
by
his
*NL*
good-natured
brother
.
No
one
,
however
,
pitied
the
fate
of
the
two
*NL*
Malvoisins
,
who
only
suffered
the
death
which
they
had
both
well
*NL*
deserved
,
by
many
acts
of
falsehood
,
cruelty
,
and
oppression
.
*NL*
*NL*
Briefly
after
the
judicial
combat
,
Cedric
the
Saxon
was
summoned
to
the
*NL*
court
of
Richard
,
which
,
for
the
purpose
of
quieting
the
counties
that
*NL*
had
been
disturbed
by
the
ambition
of
his
brother
,
was
then
held
at
*NL*
York
.
Cedric
tushed
and
pshawed
more
than
once
at
the
message
--
but
he
*NL*
refused
not
obedience
.
In
fact
,
the
return
of
Richard
had
quenched
every
*NL*
hope
that
he
had
entertained
of
restoring
a
Saxon
dynasty
in
England
;
*NL*
for
,
whatever
head
the
Saxons
might
have
made
in
the
event
of
a
civil
*NL*
war
,
it
was
plain
that
nothing
could
be
done
under
the
undisputed
*NL*
dominion
of
Richard
,
popular
as
he
was
by
his
personal
good
qualities
*NL*
and
military
fame
,
although
his
administration
was
wilfully
careless
,
*NL*
now
too
indulgent
,
and
now
allied
to
despotism
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
moreover
,
it
could
not
escape
even
Cedric
's
reluctant
observation
,
*NL*
that
his
project
for
an
absolute
union
among
the
Saxons
,
by
the
marriage
*NL*
of
Rowena
and
Athelstane
,
was
now
completely
at
an
end
,
by
the
mutual
*NL*
dissent
of
both
parties
concerned
.
This
was
,
indeed
,
an
event
which
,
in
*NL*
his
ardour
for
the
Saxon
cause
,
he
could
not
have
anticipated
,
and
even
*NL*
when
the
disinclination
of
both
was
broadly
and
plainly
manifested
,
he
*NL*
could
scarce
bring
himself
to
believe
that
two
Saxons
of
royal
descent
*NL*
should
scruple
,
on
personal
grounds
,
at
an
alliance
so
necessary
for
the
*NL*
public
weal
of
the
nation
.
But
it
was
not
the
less
certain
:
Rowena
had
*NL*
always
expressed
her
repugnance
to
Athelstane
,
and
now
Athelstane
was
*NL*
no
less
plain
and
positive
in
proclaiming
his
resolution
never
to
pursue
*NL*
his
addresses
to
the
Lady
Rowena
.
Even
the
natural
obstinacy
of
Cedric
*NL*
sunk
beneath
these
obstacles
,
where
he
,
remaining
on
the
point
of
*NL*
junction
,
had
the
task
of
dragging
a
reluctant
pair
up
to
it
,
one
with
*NL*
each
hand
.
He
made
,
however
,
a
last
vigorous
attack
on
Athelstane
,
and
*NL*
he
found
that
resuscitated
sprout
of
Saxon
royalty
engaged
,
like
country
*NL*
squires
of
our
own
day
,
in
a
furious
war
with
the
clergy
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seems
that
,
after
all
his
deadly
menaces
against
the
Abbot
of
Saint
*NL*
Edmund
's
,
Athelstane
's
spirit
of
revenge
,
what
between
the
natural
*NL*
indolent
kindness
of
his
own
disposition
,
what
through
the
prayers
of
*NL*
his
mother
Edith
,
attached
,
like
most
ladies
,
-LRB-
of
the
period
,
-RRB-
to
the
*NL*
clerical
order
,
had
terminated
in
his
keeping
the
Abbot
and
his
monks
in
*NL*
the
dungeons
of
Coningsburgh
for
three
days
on
a
meagre
diet
.
For
this
*NL*
atrocity
the
Abbot
menaced
him
with
excommunication
,
and
made
out
a
*NL*
dreadful
list
of
complaints
in
the
bowels
and
stomach
,
suffered
by
*NL*
himself
and
his
monks
,
in
consequence
of
the
tyrannical
and
unjust
*NL*
imprisonment
they
had
sustained
.
With
this
controversy
,
and
with
the
*NL*
means
he
had
adopted
to
counteract
this
clerical
persecution
,
Cedric
*NL*
found
the
mind
of
his
friend
Athelstane
so
fully
occupied
,
that
it
had
*NL*
no
room
for
another
idea
.
And
when
Rowena
's
name
was
mentioned
the
noble
*NL*
Athelstane
prayed
leave
to
quaff
a
full
goblet
to
her
health
,
and
that
*NL*
she
might
soon
be
the
bride
of
his
kinsman
Wilfred
.
It
was
a
desperate
*NL*
case
therefore
.
There
was
obviously
no
more
to
be
made
of
Athelstane
;
*NL*
or
,
as
Wamba
expressed
it
,
in
a
phrase
which
has
descended
from
Saxon
*NL*
times
to
ours
,
he
was
a
cock
that
would
not
fight
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
remained
betwixt
Cedric
and
the
determination
which
the
lovers
*NL*
desired
to
come
to
,
only
two
obstacles
--
his
own
obstinacy
,
and
his
*NL*
dislike
of
the
Norman
dynasty
.
The
former
feeling
gradually
gave
way
*NL*
before
the
endearments
of
his
ward
,
and
the
pride
which
he
could
not
*NL*
help
nourishing
in
the
fame
of
his
son
.
Besides
,
he
was
not
insensible
*NL*
to
the
honour
of
allying
his
own
line
to
that
of
Alfred
,
when
the
*NL*
superior
claims
of
the
descendant
of
Edward
the
Confessor
were
abandoned
*NL*
for
ever
.
Cedric
's
aversion
to
the
Norman
race
of
kings
was
also
much
*NL*
undermined
,
--
first
,
by
consideration
of
the
impossibility
of
ridding
*NL*
England
of
the
new
dynasty
,
a
feeling
which
goes
far
to
create
loyalty
*NL*
in
the
subject
to
the
king
``
de
facto
''
;
and
,
secondly
,
by
the
personal
*NL*
attention
of
King
Richard
,
who
delighted
in
the
blunt
humour
of
Cedric
,
*NL*
and
,
to
use
the
language
of
the
Wardour
Manuscript
,
so
dealt
with
the
*NL*
noble
Saxon
,
that
,
ere
he
had
been
a
guest
at
court
for
seven
days
,
he
*NL*
had
given
his
consent
to
the
marriage
of
his
ward
Rowena
and
his
son
*NL*
Wilfred
of
Ivanhoe
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
nuptials
of
our
hero
,
thus
formally
approved
by
his
father
,
were
*NL*
celebrated
in
the
most
august
of
temples
,
the
noble
Minster
of
York
.
*NL*
The
King
himself
attended
,
and
from
the
countenance
which
he
afforded
on
*NL*
this
and
other
occasions
to
the
distressed
and
hitherto
degraded
Saxons
,
*NL*
gave
them
a
safer
and
more
certain
prospect
of
attaining
their
just
*NL*
rights
,
than
they
could
reasonably
hope
from
the
precarious
chance
of
*NL*
a
civil
war
.
The
Church
gave
her
full
solemnities
,
graced
with
all
*NL*
the
splendour
which
she
of
Rome
knows
how
to
apply
with
such
brilliant
*NL*
effect
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gurth
,
gallantly
apparelled
,
attended
as
esquire
upon
his
young
master
*NL*
whom
he
had
served
so
faithfully
,
and
the
magnanimous
Wamba
,
decorated
*NL*
with
a
new
cap
and
a
most
gorgeous
set
of
silver
bells
.
Sharers
of
*NL*
Wilfred
's
dangers
and
adversity
,
they
remained
,
as
they
had
a
right
to
*NL*
expect
,
the
partakers
of
his
more
prosperous
career
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
besides
this
domestic
retinue
,
these
distinguished
nuptials
were
*NL*
celebrated
by
the
attendance
of
the
high-born
Normans
,
as
well
as
*NL*
Saxons
,
joined
with
the
universal
jubilee
of
the
lower
orders
,
that
*NL*
marked
the
marriage
of
two
individuals
as
a
pledge
of
the
future
peace
*NL*
and
harmony
betwixt
two
races
,
which
,
since
that
period
,
have
been
so
*NL*
completely
mingled
,
that
the
distinction
has
become
wholly
invisible
.
*NL*
Cedric
lived
to
see
this
union
approximate
towards
its
completion
;
for
*NL*
as
the
two
nations
mixed
in
society
and
formed
intermarriages
with
each
*NL*
other
,
the
Normans
abated
their
scorn
,
and
the
Saxons
were
refined
from
*NL*
their
rusticity
.
But
it
was
not
until
the
reign
of
Edward
the
Third
*NL*
that
the
mixed
language
,
now
termed
English
,
was
spoken
at
the
court
*NL*
of
London
,
and
that
the
hostile
distinction
of
Norman
and
Saxon
seems
*NL*
entirely
to
have
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
upon
the
second
morning
after
this
happy
bridal
,
that
the
Lady
*NL*
Rowena
was
made
acquainted
by
her
handmaid
Elgitha
,
that
a
damsel
*NL*
desired
admission
to
her
presence
,
and
solicited
that
their
parley
might
*NL*
be
without
witness
.
Rowena
wondered
,
hesitated
,
became
curious
,
and
*NL*
ended
by
commanding
the
damsel
to
be
admitted
,
and
her
attendants
to
*NL*
withdraw
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
entered
--
a
noble
and
commanding
figure
,
the
long
white
veil
,
*NL*
in
which
she
was
shrouded
,
overshadowing
rather
than
concealing
the
*NL*
elegance
and
majesty
of
her
shape
.
Her
demeanour
was
that
of
respect
,
*NL*
unmingled
by
the
least
shade
either
of
fear
,
or
of
a
wish
to
propitiate
*NL*
favour
.
Rowena
was
ever
ready
to
acknowledge
the
claims
,
and
attend
to
*NL*
the
feelings
,
of
others
.
She
arose
,
and
would
have
conducted
her
*NL*
lovely
visitor
to
a
seat
;
but
the
stranger
looked
at
Elgitha
,
and
again
*NL*
intimated
a
wish
to
discourse
with
the
Lady
Rowena
alone
.
Elgitha
had
no
*NL*
sooner
retired
with
unwilling
steps
,
than
,
to
the
surprise
of
the
Lady
*NL*
of
Ivanhoe
,
her
fair
visitant
kneeled
on
one
knee
,
pressed
her
hands
to
*NL*
her
forehead
,
and
bending
her
head
to
the
ground
,
in
spite
of
Rowena
's
*NL*
resistance
,
kissed
the
embroidered
hem
of
her
tunic
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
means
this
,
lady
?
''
said
the
surprised
bride
;
``
or
why
do
you
offer
*NL*
to
me
a
deference
so
unusual
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
to
you
,
Lady
of
Ivanhoe
,
''
said
Rebecca
,
rising
up
and
resuming
*NL*
the
usual
quiet
dignity
of
her
manner
,
``
I
may
lawfully
,
and
without
*NL*
rebuke
,
pay
the
debt
of
gratitude
which
I
owe
to
Wilfred
of
Ivanhoe
.
*NL*
I
am
--
forgive
the
boldness
which
has
offered
to
you
the
homage
of
my
*NL*
country
--
I
am
the
unhappy
Jewess
,
for
whom
your
husband
hazarded
his
*NL*
life
against
such
fearful
odds
in
the
tiltyard
of
Templestowe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Damsel
,
''
said
Rowena
,
``
Wilfred
of
Ivanhoe
on
that
day
rendered
back
but
*NL*
in
slight
measure
your
unceasing
charity
towards
him
in
his
wounds
and
*NL*
misfortunes
.
Speak
,
is
there
aught
remains
in
which
he
or
I
can
serve
*NL*
thee
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
''
said
Rebecca
,
calmly
,
``
unless
you
will
transmit
to
him
my
*NL*
grateful
farewell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
leave
England
then
?
''
said
Rowena
,
scarce
recovering
the
surprise
of
*NL*
this
extraordinary
visit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
leave
it
,
lady
,
ere
this
moon
again
changes
.
My
father
had
a
brother
*NL*
high
in
favour
with
Mohammed
Boabdil
,
King
of
Grenada
--
thither
we
go
,
*NL*
secure
of
peace
and
protection
,
for
the
payment
of
such
ransom
as
the
*NL*
Moslem
exact
from
our
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
are
you
not
then
as
well
protected
in
England
?
''
said
Rowena
.
*NL*
``
My
husband
has
favour
with
the
King
--
the
King
himself
is
just
and
*NL*
generous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lady
,
''
said
Rebecca
,
``
I
doubt
it
not
--
but
the
people
of
England
are
a
*NL*
fierce
race
,
quarrelling
ever
with
their
neighbours
or
among
themselves
,
*NL*
and
ready
to
plunge
the
sword
into
the
bowels
of
each
other
.
Such
is
*NL*
no
safe
abode
for
the
children
of
my
people
.
Ephraim
is
an
heartless
*NL*
dove
--
Issachar
an
over-laboured
drudge
,
which
stoops
between
two
*NL*
burdens
.
Not
in
a
land
of
war
and
blood
,
surrounded
by
hostile
*NL*
neighbours
,
and
distracted
by
internal
factions
,
can
Israel
hope
to
rest
*NL*
during
her
wanderings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
,
maiden
,
''
said
Rowena
--
``
you
surely
can
have
nothing
to
fear
.
*NL*
She
who
nursed
the
sick-bed
of
Ivanhoe
,
''
she
continued
,
rising
with
*NL*
enthusiasm
--
``
she
can
have
nothing
to
fear
in
England
,
where
Saxon
and
*NL*
Norman
will
contend
who
shall
most
do
her
honour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thy
speech
is
fair
,
lady
,
''
said
Rebecca
,
``
and
thy
purpose
fairer
;
but
*NL*
it
may
not
be
--
there
is
a
gulf
betwixt
us
.
Our
breeding
,
our
faith
,
*NL*
alike
forbid
either
to
pass
over
it
.
Farewell
--
yet
,
ere
I
go
indulge
me
*NL*
one
request
.
The
bridal-veil
hangs
over
thy
face
;
deign
to
raise
it
,
and
*NL*
let
me
see
the
features
of
which
fame
speaks
so
highly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
scarce
worthy
of
being
looked
upon
,
''
said
Rowena
;
``
but
,
*NL*
expecting
the
same
from
my
visitant
,
I
remove
the
veil
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
it
off
accordingly
;
and
,
partly
from
the
consciousness
of
*NL*
beauty
,
partly
from
bashfulness
,
she
blushed
so
intensely
,
that
cheek
,
*NL*
brow
,
neck
,
and
bosom
,
were
suffused
with
crimson
.
Rebecca
blushed
also
,
*NL*
but
it
was
a
momentary
feeling
;
and
,
mastered
by
higher
emotions
,
past
*NL*
slowly
from
her
features
like
the
crimson
cloud
,
which
changes
colour
*NL*
when
the
sun
sinks
beneath
the
horizon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lady
,
''
she
said
,
``
the
countenance
you
have
deigned
to
show
me
will
long
*NL*
dwell
in
my
remembrance

There
reigns
in
it
gentleness
and
goodness
;
and
*NL*
if
a
tinge
of
the
world
's
pride
or
vanities
may
mix
with
an
expression
*NL*
so
lovely
,
how
should
we
chide
that
which
is
of
earth
for
bearing
some
*NL*
colour
of
its
original
?
Long

long
will
I
remember
your

*NL*
bless
God
that
I
leave
my
noble
deliverer
united
with

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
stopped
short
--
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
.
She
hastily
wiped
them
,
*NL*
and
answered
to
the
anxious
enquiries
of
Rowena
--
``
I
am
well
,

well

But
my
heart
swells

I
think
of

Templestowe

Farewell

One
,
the
most
trifling
part
of
my
duty
,
remains
*NL*
undischarged
.
Accept
this
casket
--
startle
not
at
its
contents
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rowena
opened
the
small
silver-chased
casket
,
and
perceived
a
carcanet
,
*NL*
or
neck
lace
,
with
ear-jewels
,
of
diamonds
,
which
were
obviously
of
*NL*
immense
value
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
impossible
,
''
she
said
,
tendering
back
the
casket
.
``
I
dare
not
*NL*
accept
a
gift
of
such
consequence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
keep
it
,
lady
,
''
returned
Rebecca
.
--
``
You
have
power
,
rank
,
command

*NL*
influence

we
have
wealth
,
the
source
both
of
our
strength
and
weakness
;
*NL*
the
value
of
these
toys
,
ten
times
multiplied
,
would
not
influence
half
*NL*
so
much
as
your
slightest
wish

To
you
,
therefore
,
the
gift
is
of
little
*NL*
value
,
--
and
to
me
,
what
I
part
with
is
of
much
less
.
Let
me
not
think
*NL*
you
deem
so
wretchedly
ill
of
my
nation
as
your
commons
believe

Think
*NL*
ye
that
I
prize
these
sparkling
fragments
of
stone
above
my
liberty

*NL*
or
that
my
father
values
them
in
comparison
to
the
honour
of
his
only

child

Accept
them

me
they

valueless

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
then
unhappy
!

said
Rowena
,
struck
with
the
manner
in
which
*NL*
Rebecca
uttered
the
last
words
.
``
O

remain
with
us

the
counsel

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

answered
Rebecca

the

calm
melancholy
reigning
in
her

soft
voice

beautiful
features

``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
then
convents

to
one
of
which
you
mean
to
retire

''
asked
*NL*
Rowena
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

lady

''
said
the
Jewess
;
``
but
among
our
people
,
since
the
time
of

Abraham
downwards

have
been
women

to

Heaven
,
and
their
actions
to
works
of
kindness
to
men
,
tending
the
*NL*
sick
,
feeding
the
hungry
,
and
relieving
the
distressed

Among
these
will
*NL*
Rebecca
be
numbered

Say
this
to
thy
lord

he
chance

enquire

There
was
an
involuntary
tremour
on
Rebecca
's
voice
,
and
a
tenderness
*NL*
of
accent
,
which
perhaps
betrayed
more
than
she
would
willingly
have
*NL*
expressed
.
She
hastened
to
bid
Rowena
adieu

*NL*
*NL*
``

said

``
May
He

She
glided
from

leaving
Rowena
surprised
as

a

*NL*
had
passed
before

The
fair
Saxon
related
the
singular
conference
to
*NL*
her
husband
,
on
whose
mind
it
made
a
deep
impression

He
lived
long

*NL*
happily
with
Rowena
,
for
they
were
attached
to
each
other
by
the
*NL*
bonds
of
early
affection

and
they
loved
each
other
the
more
,
from
the
*NL*
recollection
of
the
obstacles
which
had
impeded
their

Yet
it
*NL*
would
be
enquiring
too
curiously
to
ask
,
whether
the
recollection
*NL*
of
Rebecca
's
beauty
and
magnanimity
did
not
recur
to
his
mind
more
*NL*
frequently
than
the
fair
descendant
of
Alfred
might
altogether
have
*NL*
approved
.

*NL*
Ivanhoe
distinguished
himself
in
the
service
of
Richard
,

was
graced
*NL*
with
farther
marks
of

He
might
have
risen

for
the
premature
death
of
the
heroic
Coeur-de-Lion

before

With
the

perished
all

A
most
sensible
grievance
of
those
aggrieved
times
were
the
Forest
Laws
.
*NL*
These
oppressive
enactments
were
the
produce
of
the
Norman

,
*NL*
for
the
Saxon
laws
of

were
mild

;

those
of
*NL*
William
,
enthusiastically
attached
to
the
exercise
and
its
rights
,
were
*NL*
to
the
last
degree
tyrannical
.
The
formation
of
the
New
Forest
,
bears
*NL*
evidence
to
his
passion
for
hunting
,
where
he
reduced
many
a

``

The

that

Negro
Slaves
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
severe
accuracy
of
some
critics
has
objected
to
the
complexion
of
*NL*
the
slaves
of
Brian
de
Bois-Guilbert
,
as
being
totally
out
of
costume
*NL*
and
propriety
.
I
remember
the
same
objection
being
made
to
a
set
of
*NL*
sable
functionaries
,
whom
my
friend
,
Mat
Lewis
,
introduced
as
the
*NL*
guards
and
mischief-doing
satellites
of
the
wicked
Baron
,
in
his
Castle
*NL*
Spectre
.
Mat
treated
the
objection
with
great
contempt
,
and
averred
*NL*
in
reply
,
that
he
made
the
slaves
black
in
order
to
obtain
a
striking
*NL*
effect
of
contrast
,
and
that
,
could
he
have
derived
a
similar
advantage
*NL*
from
making
his
heroine
blue
,
blue
she
should
have
been
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
not
pretend
to
plead
the
immunities
of
my
order
so
highly
as
this
;
*NL*
but
neither
will
I
allow
that
the
author
of
a
modern
antique
romance
*NL*
is
obliged
to
confine
himself
to
the
introduction
of
those
manners
*NL*
only
which
can
be
proved
to
have
absolutely
existed
in
the
times
he
*NL*
is
depicting
,
so
that
he
restrain
himself
to
such
as
are
plausible
and
*NL*
natural
,
and
contain
no
obvious
anachronism
.
In
this
point
of
view
,
*NL*
what
can
be
more
natural
,
than
that
the
Templars
,
who
,
we
know
,
copied
*NL*
closely
the
luxuries
of
the
Asiatic
warriors
with
whom
they
fought
,
*NL*
should
use
the
service
of
the
enslaved
Africans
,
whom
the
fate
of
war
*NL*
transferred
to
new
masters
?
I
am
sure
,
if
there
are
no
precise
proofs
*NL*
of
their
having
done
so
,
there
is
nothing
,
on
the
other
hand
,
that
can
*NL*
entitle
us
positively
to
conclude
that
they
never
did
.
Besides
,
there
is
*NL*
an
instance
in
romance
.
*NL*
*NL*
John
of
Rampayne
,
an
excellent
juggler
and
minstrel
,
undertook
to
effect
*NL*
the
escape
of
one
Audulf
de
Bracy
,
by
presenting
himself
in
disguise
*NL*
at
the
court
of
the
king
,
where
he
was
confined
.
For
this
purpose
,
``
he
*NL*
stained
his
hair
and
his
whole
body
entirely
as
black
as
jet
,
so
that
*NL*
nothing
was
white
but
his
teeth
,
''
and
succeeded
in
imposing
himself
*NL*
on
the
king
,
as
an
Ethiopian
minstrel
.
He
effected
,
by
stratagem
,
the
*NL*
escape
of
the
prisoner
.
Negroes
,
therefore
,
must
have
been
known
in
*NL*
England
in
the
dark
ages
.

The
realm
of
France
,
it

well
known
,
was
divided
betwixt
the
Norman
*NL*
and
Teutonic
race
,
who
spoke
the
language
in
which
the
word
Yes
is
*NL*
pronounced
as
``
oui
''
,
and
the
inhabitants
of
the

,
whose
*NL*
speech
bearing
some
affinity
to
the
Italian
,
pronounced
the
same
word
*NL*
``
oc
''
.
The
poets
of
the
former
race
were
called
``
Minstrels
''
,
and
their
*NL*
poems
``
Lays
''
:
those
of
the
latter
were
termed
``
Troubadours

and
their

called
``

other

Richard
,
a

admirer
of
the

science
in
all
its
branches
,
could
imitate
either
*NL*
the
minstrel

It
is
less
likely
that
he
should
have
been
*NL*
able
to
compose

sing
an

Battle
of
Stamford
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
great
topographical
blunder
occurred
here
in
former
editions
.
The
*NL*
bloody
battle
alluded
to
in
the
text
,
fought
and
won
by
King
Harold
,
*NL*
over
his
brother
the
rebellious
Tosti
,
and
an
auxiliary
force
of
Danes
*NL*
or
Norsemen
,
was
said
,
in
the
text
,
and
a
corresponding
note
,
to
have
*NL*
taken
place
at
Stamford
,
in
Leicestershire
,
and
upon
the
river
Welland
.
*NL*
This
is
a
mistake
,
into
which
the
author
has
been
led
by
trusting
to
his
*NL*
memory
,
and
so
confounding
two
places
of
the
same
name
.
The
Stamford
,
*NL*
Strangford
,
or
Staneford
,
at
which
the
battle
really
was
fought
,
is
a
*NL*
ford
upon
the
river
Derwent
,
at
the
distance
of
about
seven
miles
from
*NL*
York
,
and
situated
in
that
large
and
opulent
county
.
A
long
wooden
*NL*
bridge
over
the
Derwent
,
the
site
of
which
,
with
one
remaining
buttress
,
*NL*
is
still
shown
to
the
curious
traveller
,
was
furiously
contested
.
One
*NL*
Norwegian
long
defended
it
by
his
single
arm
,
and
was
at
length
pierced
*NL*
with
a
spear
thrust
through
the
planks
of
the
bridge
from
a
boat
*NL*
beneath
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
neighbourhood
of
Stamford
,
on
the
Derwent
,
contains
some
memorials
*NL*
of
the
battle
.
Horseshoes
,
swords
,
and
the
heads
of
halberds
,
or
bills
,
*NL*
are
often
found
there
;
one
place
is
called
the
``
Danes
'
well
,
''
another
*NL*
the
``
Battle
flats
.
''
From
a
tradition
that
the
weapon
with
which
the
*NL*
Norwegian
champion
was
slain
,
resembled
a
pear
,
or
,
as
others
say
,
that
*NL*
the
trough
or
boat
in
which
the
soldier
floated
under
the
bridge
to
*NL*
strike
the
blow
,
had
such
a
shape
,
the
country
people
usually
begin
a
*NL*
great
market
,
which
is
held
at
Stamford
,
with
an
entertainment
called
*NL*
the
Pear-pie
feast
,
which
after
all
may
be
a
corruption
of
the
Spear-pie
*NL*
feast
.
For
more
particulars
,
Drake
's
History
of

The

mistake
was
pointed

him
,
in
the
most
obliging
*NL*
manner
,
by

that

the

the

of
the

Abbots

Priors
,
and
so
forth
,
*NL*
were
no
longer
vested
in
ecclesiastics
,
but
in
lay
impropriators
of
the
*NL*
church
revenues
,
or
,
as
the
Scottish
lawyers
called
them
,
titulars
*NL*
of
the
temporalities
of
the
benefice
,
though
having
no
claim
to
the
*NL*
spiritual
character
of
their
predecessors
in
office
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
these
laymen
,
who
were
thus
invested
with
ecclesiastical
revenues
,
*NL*
some
were
men
of
high
birth
and
rank
,
like
the
famous
Lord
James
*NL*
Stewart
,
the
Prior
of
St

,
who
did
not
fail
to
keep
for
their
own
*NL*
use
the
rents
,
lands
,
and
revenues
of
the
church
.
But
if
,
on
the
*NL*
other
hand
,
the
titulars
were
men
of
inferior
importance
,
who
had
been
*NL*
inducted
into
the
office
by
the
interest
of
some
powerful
person
,
it
was
*NL*
generally
understood
that
the

Abbot
should
grant
for
his
patron
's
*NL*
benefit
such
leases
and
conveyances
of
the
church
lands
and
tithes
as
*NL*
might
afford
their

lion

of

.

the
*NL*
origin
of
those
who
were
wittily
termed
Tulchan

being

whose

up

enable
his

and
principal
to
plunder
the

under

There
were
other
cases
,
however
,
in
which
men
who
had
got
grants
of
*NL*
these
secularised
benefices
,
were
desirous
of
retaining
them
for
their
*NL*
own
use
,
without
having
the
influence
sufficient
to
establish
their
*NL*
purpose
;
and
these
became
frequently
unable
to
protect
themselves
,
*NL*
however
unwilling
to
submit
to
the
exactions
of
the
feudal
tyrant
of
the

*NL*
Bannatyne
,
secretary

recounts
a
singular
course
of

oppression
practised
on
one
of
those
titulars
abbots
,
by
the
Earl
of
*NL*
Cassilis
in
Ayrshire
,
whose
extent
of
feudal
influence
was
so
wide
that
*NL*
he
was
usually
termed
the
King
of
Carrick
.
We
give
the
fact
as
it
occurs
*NL*
in
Bannatyne
's
Journal
,
only
premising
that
the
Journalist
held
his
*NL*
master
's
opinions
,
both
with
respect
to
the
Earl
of
Cassilis
as
an
*NL*
opposer
of
the
king
's
party
,
and
as
being
a
detester
of
the
practice
of
*NL*
granting
church
revenues
to
titulars
,
instead
of
their
being
devoted
to
*NL*
pious

such
as
the
support
of
the

expense
of

a

.
*NL*
The
said
Earl
thinking
himself
greater
than
any
king
in
those
quarters
,
*NL*
determined
to
have
that
whole
benefice
-LRB-
as
he
hath
divers
others
-RRB-
to
*NL*
pay
at
his
pleasure
;
and
because
he
could
not
find
sic
security
as
his
*NL*
insatiable
appetite
required
,
this
shift
was
devised
.
The
said
Mr
Allan
*NL*
being
in
company
with
the
Laird
of
Bargany
,
-LRB-
also
a
Kennedy
,
-RRB-
was
,
by
*NL*
the
Earl
and
his
friends
,
enticed
to
leave
the
safeguard
which
he
had
*NL*
with
the
Laird
,
and
come
to
make
good
cheer
with
the
said
Earl
.
The
*NL*
simplicity
of
the
imprudent
man
was
suddenly
abused
;
and
so
he
passed
*NL*
his
time
with
them
certain
days
,
which
he
did
in
Maybole
with
Thomas
*NL*
Kennedie
,
uncle
to
the
said
Earl
;
after
which
the
said
Mr
Allan
passed
,
*NL*
with
quiet
company
,
to
visit
the
place
and
bounds
of
Crossraguel
,
-LSB-
his
*NL*
abbacy
,
-RSB-
of
which
the
said
Earl
being
surely
advertised
,
determined
to
*NL*
put
in
practice
the
tyranny
which
long
before
he
had
conceived
.
And
so
,
*NL*
as
king
of
the
country
,
apprehended
the
said
Mr
Allan
,
and
carried
him
*NL*
to
the
house
of
Denure
,
where
for
a
season
he
was
honourably
treated
,
*NL*
-LRB-
if
a
prisoner
can
think
any
entertainment
pleasing
;-RRB-
but
after
that
*NL*
certain
days
were
spent
,
and
that
the
Earl
could
not
obtain
the
feus
of
*NL*
Crossraguel
according
to
his
own
appetite
,
he
determined
to
prove
if
a
*NL*
collation
could
work
that
which
neither
dinner
nor
supper
could
do
for
*NL*
a
long
time
.
And
so
the
said
Mr
Allan
was
carried
to
a
secret
chamber
:
*NL*
with
him
passed
the
honourable
Earl
,
his
worshipful
brother
,
and
such
as
*NL*
were
appointed
to
be
servants
at
that
banquet
.
In
the
chamber
there
was
*NL*
a
grit
iron
chimlay
,
under
it
a
fire
;
other
grit
provision
was
not
seen
.
*NL*
The
first
course
was
,
--
`
My
Lord
Abbot
,
'
-LRB-
said
the
Earl
,
-RRB-
`
it
will
please
*NL*
you
confess
here
,
that
with
your
own
consent
you
remain
in
my
company
,
*NL*
because
ye
durst
not
commit
yourself
to
the
hands
of
others
.
'
The
Abbot
*NL*
answered
,
`
Would
you
,
my
lord
,
that
I
should
make
a
manifest
lie
for
*NL*
your
pleasure
?
The
truth
is
,
my
lord
,
it
is
against
my
will
that
I
am
*NL*
here
;
neither
yet
have
I
any
pleasure
in
your
company
.
'
`
But
ye
shall
*NL*
remain
with
me
,
nevertheless
,
at
this
time
,
'
said
the
Earl
.
'
I
am
not
*NL*
able
to
resist
your
will
and
pleasure
,
'
said
the
Abbot
,
`
in
this
place
.
'
*NL*
`
Ye
must
then
obey
me
,
'
said
the
Earl
,
--
and
with
that
were
presented
*NL*
unto
him
certain
letters
to
subscribe
,
amongst
which
there
was
a
five
*NL*
years
'
tack
,
and
a
nineteen
years
'
tack
,
and
a
charter
of
feu
of
all
the
*NL*
lands
-LRB-
of
Crossraguel
-RRB-
,
with
all
the
clauses
necessary
for
the
Earl
to
*NL*
haste
him
to
hell
.
For
if
adultery
,
sacrilege
,
oppression
,
barbarous
*NL*
cruelty
,
and
theft
heaped
upon
theft
,
deserve
hell
,
the
great
King
*NL*
of
Carrick
can
no
more
escape
hell
for
ever
,
than
the
imprudent
Abbot
*NL*
escaped
the
fire
for
a
season
as
follows
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
that
the
Earl
spied
repugnance
,
and
saw
that
he
could
not
come
*NL*
to
his
purpose
by
fair
means
,
he
commanded
his
cooks
to
prepare
the
*NL*
banquet
:
and
so
first
they
flayed
the
sheep
,
that
is
,
they
took
off
*NL*
the
Abbot
's
cloathes
even
to
his
skin
,
and
next
they
bound
him
to
the
*NL*
chimney
--
his
legs
to
the
one
end
,
and
his
arms
to
the
other
;
and
so
they
*NL*
began
to
beet
-LSB-
i.e.
feed
-RSB-
the
fire
sometimes
to
his
buttocks
,
sometimes
*NL*
to
his
legs
,
sometimes
to
his
shoulders
and
arms
;
and
that
the
roast
*NL*
might
not
burn
,
but
that
it
might
rest
in
soppe
,
they
spared
not
*NL*
flambing
with
oil
,
-LRB-
basting
as
a
cook
bastes
roasted
meat
-RRB-
;
Lord
,
look
*NL*
thou
to
sic
cruelty
!
And
that
the
crying
of
the
miserable
man
should
not
*NL*
be
heard
,
they
dosed
his
mouth
that
the
voice
might
be
stopped
.
It
may
*NL*
be
suspected
that
some
partisan
of
the
King
's
-LSB-
Darnley
's
-RSB-
murder
was
*NL*
there
.
In
that
torment
they
held
the
poor
man
,
till
that
often
he
cried
*NL*
for
God
's
sake
to
dispatch
him
;
for
he
had
as
meikle
gold
in
his
awin
*NL*
purse
as
would
buy
powder
enough
to
shorten
his
pain
.
The
famous
King
of
*NL*
Carrick
and
his
cooks
perceiving
the
roast
to
be
aneuch
,
commanded
it
*NL*
to
be
tane
fra
the
fire
,
and
the
Earl
himself
began
the
grace
in
this
*NL*
manner
:
--
`
Benedicite
,
Jesus
Maria
,
you
are
the
most
obstinate
man
that
*NL*
ever
I
saw
;
gif
I
had
known
that
ye
had
been
so
stubborn
,
I
would
not
*NL*
for
a
thousand
crowns
have
handled
you
so
;
I
never
did
so
to
man
before
*NL*
you
.
'
And
yet
he
returned
to
the
same
practice
within
two
days
,
and
*NL*
ceased
not
till
that
he
obtained
his
formost
purpose
,
that
is
,
that
*NL*
he
had
got
all
his
pieces
subscryvit
alsweill
as
ane
half-roasted
hand
*NL*
could
do
it
.
The
Earl
thinking
himself
sure
enough
so
long
as
he
had
*NL*
the
half-roasted
Abbot
in
his
own
keeping
,
and
yet
being
ashamed
of
his
*NL*
presence
by
reason
of
his
former
cruelty
,
left
the
place
of
Denure
in
*NL*
the
hands
of
certain
of
his
servants
,
and
the
half-roasted
Abbot
to
be
*NL*
kept
there
as
prisoner
.
The
Laird
of
Bargany
,
out
of
whose
company
the
*NL*
said
Abbot
had
been
enticed
,
understanding
,
-LRB-
not
the
extremity
,
-RRB-
but
*NL*
the
retaining
of
the
man
,
sent
to
the
court
,
and
raised
letters
of
*NL*
deliverance
of
the
person
of
the
man
according
to
the
order
,
which
being
*NL*
disobeyed
,
the
said
Earl
for
his
contempt
was
denounced
rebel
,
and
put
*NL*
to
the
horne
.
But
yet
hope
was
there
none
,
neither
to
the
afflicted
*NL*
to
be
delivered
,
neither
yet
to
the
purchaser
-LSB-
i.e.
procurer
-RSB-
of
*NL*
the
letters
to
obtain
any
comfort
thereby
;
for
in
that
time
God
was
*NL*
despised
,
and
the
lawful
authority
was
contemned
in
Scotland
,
in
hope
*NL*
of
the
sudden
return
and
regiment
of
that
cruel
murderer
of
her
awin
*NL*
husband
,
of
whose
lords
the
said
Earl
was
called
one
;
and
yet
,
oftener
*NL*
than
once
,
he
was
solemnly
sworn
to
the
King
and
to
his
Regent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Journalist
then
recites
the
complaint
of
the
injured
Allan
Stewart
,
*NL*
Commendator
of
Crossraguel
,
to
the
Regent
and
Privy
Council
,
averring
*NL*
his
having
been
carried
,
partly
by
flattery
,
partly
by
force
,
to
the
*NL*
black
vault
of
Denure
,
a
strong
fortalice
,
built
on
a
rock
overhanging
*NL*
the
Irish
channel
,
where
to
execute
leases
and
conveyances
of
the
whole
*NL*
churches
and
parsonages
belonging
to
the
Abbey
of
Crossraguel
,
which
he
*NL*
utterly
refused
as
an
unreasonable
demand
,
and
the
more
so
that
he
had
*NL*
already
conveyed
them
to
John
Stewart
of
Cardonah
,
by
whose
interest
he
*NL*
had
been
made
Commendator
.
The
complainant
proceeds
to
state
,
that
he
*NL*
was
,
after
many
menaces
,
stript
,
bound
,
and
his
limbs
exposed
to
fire
*NL*
in
the
manner
already
described
,
till
,
compelled
by
excess
of
agony
,
he
*NL*
subscribed
the
charter
and
leases
presented
to
him
,
of
the
contents
*NL*
of
which
he
was
totally
ignorant
.
A
few
days
afterwards
,
being
again
*NL*
required
to
execute
a
ratification
of
these
deeds
before
a
notary
and
*NL*
witnesses
,
and
refusing
to
do
so
,
he
was
once
more
subjected
to
the
same
*NL*
torture
,
until
his
agony
was
so
excessive
that
he
exclaimed
,
``
Fye
on
*NL*
you
,
why
do
you
not
strike
your
whingers
into
me
,
or
blow
me
up
with
a
*NL*
barrel
of
powder
,
rather
than
torture
me
thus
unmercifully
?
''
upon
which
*NL*
the
Earl
commanded
Alexander
Richard
,
one
of
his
attendants
,
to
stop
the
*NL*
patient
's
mouth
with
a
napkin
,
which
was
done
accordingly
.
Thus
he
was
*NL*
once
more
compelled
to
submit
to
their
tyranny
.
The
petition
concluded
*NL*
with
stating
,
that
the
Earl
,
under
pretence
of
the
deeds
thus
*NL*
iniquitously
obtained
,
had
taken
possession
of
the
whole
place
and
*NL*
living
of
Crossraguel
,
and
enjoyed
the
profits
thereof
for
three
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doom
of
the
Regent
and
Council
shows
singularly
the
total
*NL*
interruption
of
justice
at
this
calamitous
period
,
even
in
the
most
*NL*
clamant
cases
of
oppression
.
The
Council
declined
interference
with
*NL*
the
course
of
the
ordinary
justice
of
the
county
,
-LRB-
which
was
completely
*NL*
under
the
said
Earl
of
Cassilis
'
control
,
-RRB-
and
only
enacted
,
that
he
*NL*
should
forbear
molestation
of
the
unfortunate
Comendator
,
under
the
*NL*
surety
of
two
thousand
pounds
Scots
.
The
Earl
was
appointed
also
to
keep
*NL*
the
peace
towards
the
celebrated
George
Buchanan
,
who
had
a
pension
out
*NL*
of
the
same
Abbacy
,
to
a
similar
extent
,
and
under
the
like
penalty
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
consequences
are
thus
described
by
the
Journalist
already
quoted
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
said
Laird
of
Bargany
perceiving
that
the
ordiner
justice
could
*NL*
neither
help
the
oppressed
,
nor
yet
the
afflicted
,
applied
his
mind
*NL*
to
the
next
remedy
,
and
in
the
end
,
by
his
servants
,
took
the
house
*NL*
of
Denure
,
where
the
poor
Abbot
was
kept
prisoner
.
The
bruit
flew
fra
*NL*
Carrick
to
Galloway
,
and
so
suddenly
assembled
herd
and
hyre-man
that
*NL*
pertained
to
the
band
of
the
Kennedies
;
and
so
within
a
few
hours
was
*NL*
the
house
of
Denure
environed
again
.
The
master
of
Cassilis
was
the
*NL*
frackast
-LSB-
i.e.
the
readiest
or
boldest
-RSB-
and
would
not
stay
,
but
in
his
*NL*
heat
would
lay
fire
to
the
dungeon
,
with
no
small
boasting
that
all
*NL*
enemies
within
the
house
should
die
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
required
and
admonished
by
those
that
were
within
to
be
more
*NL*
moderate
,
and
not
to
hazard
himself
so
foolishly
.
But
no
admonition
*NL*
would
help
,
till
that
the
wind
of
an
hacquebute
blasted
his
shoulder
,
*NL*
and
then
ceased
he
from
further
pursuit
in
fury
.
The
Laird
of
Bargany
*NL*
had
before
purchest
-LSB-
obtained
-RSB-
of
the
authorities
,
letters
,
charging
*NL*
all
faithfull
subjects
to
the
King
's
Majesty
,
to
assist
him
against
that
*NL*
cruel
tyrant
and
mansworn
traitor
,
the
Earl
of
Cassilis
;
which
*NL*
letters
,
with
his
private
writings
,
he
published
,
and
shortly
found
*NL*
sic
concurrence
of
Kyle
and
Cunynghame
with
his
other
friends
,
that
the
*NL*
Carrick
company
drew
back
fra
the
house
:
and
so
the
other
approached
,
*NL*
furnished
the
house
with
more
men
,
delivered
the
said
Mr
Allan
,
and
*NL*
carried
him
to
Ayr
,
where
,
publicly
at
the
market
cross
of
the
said
*NL*
town
,
he
declared
how
cruelly
he
was
entreated
,
and
how
the
murdered
*NL*
King
suffered
not
sic
torment
as
he
did
,
excepting
only
he
escaped
the
*NL*
death
:
and
,
therefore
,
publickly
did
revoke
all
things
that
were
done
*NL*
in
that
extremity
,
and
especially
revoked
the
subscription
of
the
three
*NL*
writings
,
to
wit
,
of
a
fyve
yeir
tack
and
nineteen
year
tack

and
of
a

charter

And
so
the
house
remained

in
the
custody

And
so
cruelty
was
disappointed
of
proffeit
*NL*
present
,
and
shall
be
eternallie
punished
,
unless
he
earnestly
repent
.
*NL*
And
this
far
for
the
cruelty
committed
,
to
give
occasion
unto
others
,
*NL*
and
to
such
as
hate
the
monstrous
dealing
of
degenerate
nobility
,
to
*NL*
look
more
diligently
upon
their
behaviuours
,
and
to
paint
them
forth
*NL*
unto
the
world
,
that
they
themselves
may
be
ashamed
of
their
own
*NL*
beastliness
,
and
that
the
world
may
be
advertised

admonished
to
*NL*
abhor

detest

and
avoid
the
company
of
all
sic
tyrants
,
who
are
not
*NL*
worthy
of
the
society

but
ought
to
be
sent
suddenly
to
the

devil

whom
they
must
burn
without

their
contempt

This
extract
has
been
somewhat
amended
or
modernized
in
orthography
,
to
*NL*
render
it
more
intelligible
to
the
general
reader
.
I
have
to
add
,
that
*NL*
the
Kennedies
of
Bargany
,
who
interfered
in
behalf
of
the
oppressed
*NL*
Abbot
,
were
themselves
a
younger
branch
of
the
Cassilis
family
,
but
*NL*
held
different
politics
,
and
were
powerful
enough
in
this
,
and
other
*NL*
instances
,
to
bid
them
defiance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ultimate
issue
of
this
affair
does
not
appear
;
but
as
the
house
of
*NL*
Cassilis
are
still
in
possession
of
the
greater
part
of
the
feus
and
*NL*
leases
which
belonged
to
Crossraguel
Abbey
,
it
is
probable
the
talons
*NL*
of
the
King
of
Carrick
were
strong
enough
,
in
those
disorderly
times
,
to
*NL*
retain
the
prey

they
had
so
mercilessly
fixed
upon

*NL*

I
may

Heraldry
*NL*
*NL*
The
author
has
been
here
upbraided
with
false
heraldry
,
as
having
*NL*
charged
metal
upon
metal
.
It
should
be
remembered
,
however
,
that
*NL*
heraldry
had
only
its
first
rude
origin
during
the
crusades
,
and
that
*NL*
all
the
minutiae
of
its
fantastic
science
were
the
work
of
time
,
and
*NL*
introduced
at
a
much
later
period
.
Those
who
think
otherwise
must
*NL*
suppose
that
the
Goddess
of
``
Armoirers
''
,
like
the
Goddess
of
Arms
,
*NL*
sprung
into
the
world
completely
equipped
in
all
the
gaudy
trappings
of
*NL*
the
department
she
presides
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
Additional
Note
*NL*
*NL*
In
corroboration
of
said
note
,
it
may
be
observed
,
that
the
arms
,
which
*NL*
were
assumed
by
Godfrey
of
Boulogne
himself
,
after
the
conquest
of
*NL*
Jerusalem
,
was
a
cross
counter
patent
cantoned
with
four
little
crosses
*NL*
or
,
upon
a
field
azure
,
displaying
thus
metal
upon
metal
.
The
heralds
*NL*
have
tried
to
explain
this
undeniable
fact
in
different
modes
--
but
Ferne
*NL*
gallantly
contends
,
that
a
prince
of
Godfrey
's
qualities
should
not
be
*NL*
bound
by
the
ordinary
rules
.
The
Scottish
Nisbet
,
and
the
same
Ferne
,
*NL*
insist
that
the
chiefs
of
the
Crusade
must
have
assigned
to
Godfrey
this
*NL*
extraordinary
and
unwonted
coat-of-arms
,
in
order
to
induce
those
who
*NL*
should
behold
them
to
make
enquiries
;
and
hence
give
them
the
name
of
*NL*
``
arma
inquirenda
''
.
But
with
reverence
to
these
grave
authorities
,
it
*NL*
seems
unlikely
that
the
assembled
princes
of
Europe
should
have
adjudged
*NL*
to
Godfrey
a
coat
armorial
so
much
contrary
to
the
general
rule
,
if
such
*NL*
rule
had
then
existed
;
at
any
rate
,
it
proves
that
metal
upon
metal
,
now
*NL*
accounted
a
solecism
in
heraldry
,
was
admitted
in
other
cases
similar
to
*NL*
that

The

is
not
entirely
out
*NL*
of
character
with
Richard
I.
,
if

In

on

of
his

in

,
and
*NL*
his

it
is
recorded
how
he
exchanged

while
a

His

was

was

imprudent

The

stood
forth

In

It
is
curious
to
observe
,
that
in
every
state
of
society
,
some
sort
of
*NL*
ghostly
consolation
is
provided
for
the
members
of
the
community
,
though
*NL*
assembled
for
purposes
diametrically
opposite
to
religion
.
A
gang
of
*NL*
beggars
have
their
Patrico
,
and
the
banditti
of
the
Apennines
have
among
*NL*
them
persons
acting
as
monks
and
priests
,
by
whom
they
are
confessed
,
*NL*
and
who
perform
mass
before
them
.
Unquestionably
,
such
reverend
persons
,
*NL*
in
such
a
society
,
must
accommodate
their
manners
and
their
morals
to
*NL*
the
community
in
which
they
live
;
and
if
they
can
occasionally
obtain
*NL*
a
degree
of
reverence
for
their
supposed
spiritual
gifts
,
are
,
on
most
*NL*
occasions
,
loaded
with
unmerciful
ridicule
,
as
possessing
a
character
*NL*
inconsistent
with
all
around
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hence
the
fighting
parson
in
the
old
play
of
Sir
John
Oldcastle
,
and
the
*NL*
famous

of

Hood

Nor
were
such
characters
ideal
.
There

exists
a

of

against
irregular
churchmen
*NL*
of
this

,
who
associated
themselves
with
Border

desecrated
the
holiest

of
the

function
,
by
celebrating

them
for
the
benefit
of

robbers
,
and

,
amongst

without

Castle
of
Coningsburgh
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
last
saw
this
interesting
ruin
of
ancient
days
,
one
of
the
very
*NL*
few
remaining
examples
of
Saxon
fortification
,
I
was
strongly
impressed
*NL*
with
the
desire
of
tracing
out
a
sort
of
theory
on
the
subject
,
which
,
*NL*
from
some
recent
acquaintance
with
the
architecture
of
the
ancient
*NL*
Scandinavians
,
seemed
to
me
peculiarly
interesting
.
I
was
,
however
,
*NL*
obliged
by
circumstances
to
proceed
on
my
journey
,
without
leisure
to
*NL*
take
more
than
a
transient
view
of
Coningsburgh
.
Yet
the
idea
dwells
so
*NL*
strongly
in
my
mind
,
that
I
feel
considerably
tempted
to
write
a
page
or
*NL*
two
in
detailing
at
least
the
outline
of
my
hypothesis
,
leaving
better
*NL*
antiquaries
to
correct
or
refute
conclusions
which
are
perhaps
too
*NL*
hastily
drawn
.
*NL*
*NL*
Those
who
have
visited
the
Zetland
Islands
,
are
familiar
with
the
*NL*
description
of
castles
called
by
the
inhabitants
Burghs
;
and
by
the
*NL*
Highlanders
--
for
they
are
also
to
be
found
both
in
the
Western
Isles
*NL*
and
on
the
mainland
--
Duns
.
Pennant
has
engraved
a
view
of
the
famous
*NL*
Dun-Dornadilla
in
Glenelg
;
and
there
are
many
others
,
all
of
them
built
*NL*
after
a
peculiar
mode
of
architecture
,
which
argues
a
people
in
the
most
*NL*
primitive
state
of
society
.
The
most
perfect
specimen
is
that
upon
the
*NL*
island
of
Mousa
,
near
to
the
mainland
of
Zetland
,
which
is
probably
in
*NL*
the
same
state
as
when
inhabited
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
a
single
round
tower
,
the
wall
curving
in
slightly
,
and
then
*NL*
turning
outward
again
in
the
form
of
a
dice-box
,
so
that
the
defenders
*NL*
on
the
top
might
the
better
protect
the
base
.
It
is
formed
of
rough
*NL*
stones
,
selected
with
care
,
and
laid
in
courses
or
circles
,
with
much
*NL*
compactness
,
but
without
cement
of
any
kind
.
The
tower
has
never
,
to
*NL*
appearance
,
had
roofing
of
any
sort
;
a
fire
was
made
in
the
centre
of
*NL*
the
space
which
it
encloses
,
and
originally
the
building
was
probably
*NL*
little
more
than
a
wall
drawn
as
a
sort
of
screen
around
the
great
*NL*
council
fire
of
the
tribe
.
But
,
although
the
means
or
ingenuity
of
the
*NL*
builders
did
not
extend
so
far
as
to
provide
a
roof
,
they
supplied
the
*NL*
want
by
constructing
apartments
in
the
interior
of
the
walls
of
the
*NL*
tower
itself
.
The
circumvallation
formed
a
double
enclosure
,
the
inner
*NL*
side
of
which
was
,
in
fact
,
two
feet
or
three
feet
distant
from
the
*NL*
other
,
and
connected
by
a
concentric
range
of
long
flat
stones
,
thus
*NL*
forming
a
series
of
concentric
rings
or
stories
of
various
heights
,
*NL*
rising
to
the
top
of
the
tower
.
Each
of
these
stories
or
galleries
has
*NL*
four
windows
,
facing
directly
to
the
points
of
the
compass
,
and
rising
*NL*
of
course
regularly
above
each
other
.
These
four
perpendicular
ranges
*NL*
of
windows
admitted
air
,
and
,
the
fire
being
kindled
,
heat
,
or
smoke
at
*NL*
least
,
to
each
of
the
galleries
.
The
access
from
gallery
to
gallery
is
*NL*
equally
primitive
.
A
path
,
on
the
principle
of
an
inclined
plane
,
turns
*NL*
round
and
round
the
building
like
a
screw
,
and
gives
access
to
the
*NL*
different
stories
,
intersecting
each
of
them
in
its
turn
,
and
thus
*NL*
gradually
rising
to
the
top
of
the
wall
of
the
tower
.
On
the
outside
*NL*
there
are
no
windows
;
and
I
may
add
,
that
an
enclosure
of
a
square
,
or
*NL*
sometimes
a
round
form
,
gave
the
inhabitants
of
the
Burgh
an
opportunity
*NL*
to
secure
any
sheep
or
cattle
which
they
might
possess
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
is
the
general
architecture
of
that
very
early
period
when
the
*NL*
Northmen
swept
the
seas
,
and
brought
to
their
rude
houses
,
such
as
I
*NL*
have
described
them
,
the
plunder
of
polished
nations
.
In
Zetland
there
*NL*
are
several
scores
of
these
Burghs
,
occupying
in
every
case
,
capes
,
*NL*
headlands
,
islets
,
and
similar
places
of
advantage
singularly
well
*NL*
chosen
.
I
remember
the
remains
of
one
upon
an
island
in
a
small
lake
*NL*
near
Lerwick
,
which
at
high
tide
communicates
with
the
sea
,
the
access
*NL*
to
which
is
very
ingenious
,
by
means
of
a
causeway
or
dike
,
about
three
*NL*
or
four
inches
under
the
surface
of
the
water
.
This
causeway
makes
a
*NL*
sharp
angle
in
its
approach
to
the
Burgh
.
The
inhabitants
,
doubtless
,
*NL*
were
well
acquainted
with
this
,
but
strangers
,
who
might
approach
in
a
*NL*
hostile
manner
,
and
were
ignorant
of
the
curve
of
the
causeway
,
would
*NL*
probably
plunge
into
the
lake
,
which
is
six
or
seven
feet
in
depth
at
*NL*
the
least
.
This
must
have
been
the
device
of
some
Vauban
or
Cohorn
of
*NL*
those
early
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
style
of
these
buildings
evinces
that
the
architect
possessed
*NL*
neither
the
art
of
using
lime
or
cement
of
any
kind
,
nor
the
skill
to
*NL*
throw
an
arch
,
construct
a
roof
,
or
erect
a
stair
;
and
yet
,
with
all
*NL*
this
ignorance
,
showed
great
ingenuity
in
selecting
the
situation
of
*NL*
Burghs
,
and
regulating
the
access
to
them
,
as
well
as
neatness
and
*NL*
regularity
in
the
erection
,
since
the
buildings
themselves
show
a
style
*NL*
of
advance
in
the
arts
scarcely
consistent
with
the
ignorance
of
so
many
*NL*
of
the
principal
branches
of
architectural
knowledge
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
always
thought
,
that
one
of
the
most
curious
and
valuable
objects
*NL*
of
antiquaries
has
been
to
trace
the
progress
of
society
,
by
the
efforts
*NL*
made
in
early
ages
to
improve
the
rudeness
of
their
first
expedients
,
*NL*
until
they
either
approach
excellence
,
or
,
as
is
more
frequently
the
*NL*
case
,
are
supplied
by
new
and
fundamental
discoveries
,
which
supersede
*NL*
both
the
earlier
and
ruder
system
,
and
the
improvements
which
have
been
*NL*
ingrafted
upon
it
.
For
example
,
if
we
conceive
the
recent
discovery
of
*NL*
gas
to
be
so
much
improved
and
adapted
to
domestic
use
,
as
to
supersede
*NL*
all
other
modes
of
producing
domestic
light
;
we
can
already
suppose
,
*NL*
some
centuries
afterwards
,
the
heads
of
a
whole
Society
of
Antiquaries
*NL*
half
turned
by
the
discovery
of
a
pair
of
patent
snuffers
,
and
by
the
*NL*
learned
theories
which
would
be
brought
forward
to
account
for
the
form
*NL*
and
purpose
of
so
singular
an
implement
.
*NL*
*NL*
Following
some
such
principle
,
I
am
inclined
to
regard
the
singular
*NL*
Castle
of
Coningsburgh
--
I
mean
the
Saxon
part
of
it
--
as
a
step
in
*NL*
advance
from
the
rude
architecture
,
if
it
deserves
the
name
,
which
must
*NL*
have
been
common
to
the
Saxons
as
to
other
Northmen
.
The
builders
had
*NL*
attained
the
art
of
using
cement
,
and
of
roofing
a
building
,
--
great
*NL*
improvements
on
the
original
Burgh
.
But
in
the
round
keep
,
a
shape
*NL*
only
seen
in
the
most
ancient
castles
--
the
chambers
excavated
in
the
*NL*
thickness
of
the
walls
and
buttresses
--
the
difficulty
by
which
access
is
*NL*
gained
from
one
story
to
those
above
it
,
Coningsburgh
still
retains
the
*NL*
simplicity
of
its
origin
,
and
shows
by
what
slow
degrees
man
proceeded
*NL*
from
occupying
such
rude
and
inconvenient
lodgings
,
as
were
afforded
*NL*
by
the
galleries
of
the
Castle
of
Mousa
,
to
the
more
splendid
*NL*
accommodations
of
the
Norman
castles
,
with
all
their
stern
and
Gothic
*NL*
graces
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
ignorant
if
these
remarks
are
new
,
or
if
they
will
be
confirmed
*NL*
by
closer
examination
;
but
I
think
,
that
,
on
a
hasty
observation
,
*NL*
Coningsburgh
offers
means
of
curious
study
to
those
who
may
wish
to
*NL*
trace
the
history
of
architecture
back
to
the
times
preceding
the
Norman
*NL*
Conquest
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
be
highly
desirable
that
a
cork
model
should
be
taken

*NL*
Castle
of

by

*NL*
*NL*
The
Castle
of
Coningsburgh
is
thus
described
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
castle
is
large
,
the
outer
walls
standing
on
a
pleasant
ascent
from
*NL*
the
river
,
but
much
overtopt
by
a
high
hill
,
on
which
the
town
stands
,
*NL*
situated
at
the
head
of
a
rich
and
magnificent
vale
,
formed
by
an
*NL*
amphitheatre
of
woody
hills
,
in
which
flows
the
gentle
Don
.
Near
the
*NL*
castle
is
a
barrow
,
said
to
be
Hengist
's
tomb
.
The
entrance
is
flanked
*NL*
to
the
left
by
a
round
tower
,
with
a
sloping
base
,
and
there
are
several
*NL*
similar
in
the
outer
wall
the
entrance
has
piers
of
a
gate
,
and
on
the
*NL*
east
side
the
ditch
and
bank
are
double
and
very
steep
.
On
the
top
of
*NL*
the
churchyard
wall
is
a
tombstone
,
on
which
are
cut
in
high
relief
,
two
*NL*
ravens
,
or
such-like
birds
.
On
the
south
side
of
the
churchyard
lies
*NL*
an
ancient
stone
,
ridged
like
a
coffin
,
on
which
is
carved
a
man
on
*NL*
horseback
;
and
another
man
with
a
shield
encountering
a
vast
winged
*NL*
serpent
,
and
a
man
bearing
a
shield
behind
him
.
It
was
probably
one
*NL*
of
the
rude
crosses
not
uncommon
in
churchyards
in
this
county
.

The
*NL*
name
of
Coningsburgh
,
by
which
this
castle
goes
in
the
old
editions
of
*NL*
the
Britannia
,
would
lead
one
to
suppose
it
the
residence
of
the
Saxon
*NL*
kings
.
It
afterwards
belonged
to
King
Harold
.
The
Conqueror
bestowed
it
*NL*
on
William
de
Warren
,
with
all
its
privileges
and
jurisdiction
,
which
*NL*
are
said
to
have
extended
over
twenty-eight
towns
.
At
the
corner
of
the
*NL*
area
,
which
is
of
an
irregular
form
,
stands
the
great
tower
,
or
keep
,
*NL*
placed
on
a
small
hill
of
its
own
dimensions
,
on
which
lies
six
vast
*NL*
projecting
buttresses
,
ascending
in
a
steep
direction
to
prop
and
*NL*
support
the
building
,
and
continued
upwards
up
the
side
as
turrets
.
The
*NL*
tower
within
forms
a
complete
circle
,
twenty-one
feet
in
diameter
,
the
*NL*
walls
fourteen
feet
thick
.
The
ascent
into
the
tower
is
by
an
exceeding
*NL*
deep
flight
of
steep
steps
,
four
feet
and
a
half
wide
,
on
the
south
side
*NL*
leading
to
a
low
doorway
,
over
which
is
a
circular
arch
crossed
by
a
*NL*
great
transom
stone
.
Within
this
door
is
the
staircase
which
ascends
*NL*
straight
through
the
thickness
of
the
wall
,
not
communicating
with
the
*NL*
room
on
the
first
floor
,
in
whose
centre
is
the
opening
to
the
dungeon
.
*NL*
Neither
of
these
lower
rooms
is
lighted
except
from
a
hole
in
the
floor
*NL*
of
the
third
story
;
the
room
in
which
,
as
well
as
in
that
above
it
,
is
*NL*
finished
with
compact
smooth
stonework
,
both
having
chimney-pieces
,
*NL*
with
an
arch
resting
on
triple
clustered
pillars
.
In
the
third
story
,
*NL*
or
guard-chamber
,
is
a
small
recess
with
a
loop-hole
,
probably
a
*NL*
bedchamber
,
and
in
that
floor
above
a
niche
for
a
saint
or
holy-water
*NL*
pot
.
Mr.
King
imagines
this
a
Saxon
castle
of
the
first
ages
of
the
*NL*
Heptarchy
.
Mr.
Watson
thus
describes
it
.
From
the
first
floor
to
the
*NL*
second
story
,
-LRB-
third
from
the
ground
,
-RRB-
is
a
way
by
a
stair
in
the
wall
*NL*
five
feet
wide
.
The
next
staircase
is
approached
by
a
ladder
,
and
ends
*NL*
at
the
fourth
story
from
the
ground
.
Two
yards
from
the
door
,
at
the
*NL*
head
of
this
stair
,
is
an
opening
nearly
east
,
accessible
by
treading
*NL*
on
the
ledge
of
the
wall
,
which
diminishes
eight
inches
each
story
;
and
*NL*
this
last
opening
leads
into
a
room
or
chapel
ten
feet
by
twelve
,
and
*NL*
fifteen
or
sixteen
high
,
arched
with
free-stone
,
and
supported
by
small
*NL*
circular
columns
of
the
same
,
the
capitals
and
arches
Saxon
.
It
has
*NL*
an
east
window
,
and
on
each
side
in
the
wall
,
about
four
feet
from
the
*NL*
ground
,
a
stone
basin
with
a
hole
and
iron
pipe
to
convey
the
water
into
*NL*
or
through
the
wall
.
This
chapel
is
one
of
the
buttresses
,
but
no
sign
*NL*
of
it
without
,
for
even
the
window
,
though
large
within
,
is
only
a
long
*NL*
narrow
loop-hole
,
scarcely
to
be
seen
without
.
On
the
left
side
of
this
*NL*
chapel
is
a
small
oratory
,
eight
by
six
in
the
thickness
of
the
wall
,
*NL*
with
a
niche
in
the
wall
,
and
enlightened
by
a
like
loop-hole
.
The
*NL*
fourth
stair
from
the
ground
,
ten
feet
west
from
the
chapel
door
,
leads
*NL*
to
the
top
of
the
tower
through
the
thickness
of
the
wall
,
which
at
top
*NL*
is
but
three
yards
.
Each
story
is
about
fifteen
feet
high
,
so
that
the
*NL*
tower
will
be
seventy-five
feet
from
the
ground
.
The
inside
forms
a
*NL*
circle
,
whose
diameter
may
be
about
twelve
feet
.
The
well
at
the
bottom
*NL*
of
the
dungeon
is
piled
with
stones
.

This
anticipation
proved
but
too
true
,
as
my
learned
correspondent
*NL*
did
not
receive
my
letter
until
a
twelvemonth
after
it
was
written
.
I
*NL*
mention
this
circumstance
,
that
a
gentleman
attached
to
the
cause
of
*NL*
learning
,
who
now
holds
the
principal
control
of

may
*NL*
consider
whether
by
some

some

might
not
be

I
understand
,
indeed
,
that
this

was
once
tried

that
the

having
broke
down
*NL*
under
the
weight
of
packages
addressed
to
members
of
the
Society
of
*NL*

,
it
was
relinquished
as
a
hazardous
experiment
.
Surely
,
*NL*
however
it
would
be
possible
to
build
these
vehicles
in
a
form
more
*NL*
substantial
,
stronger
in
the
perch
,
and
broader
in
the

so
as
*NL*
to
support
the
weight
of

learning
;
when
,
if
they

they
would
