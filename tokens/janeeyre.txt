PREFACE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
preface
to
the
first
edition
of
``
Jane
Eyre
''
being
unnecessary
,
I
gave
*NL*
none
:
this
second
edition
demands
a
few
words
both
of
acknowledgment
and
*NL*
miscellaneous
remark
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
thanks
are
due
in
three
quarters
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
the
Public
,
for
the
indulgent
ear
it
has
inclined
to
a
plain
tale
with
*NL*
few
pretensions
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
the
Press
,
for
the
fair
field
its
honest
suffrage
has
opened
to
an
*NL*
obscure
aspirant
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
my
Publishers
,
for
the
aid
their
tact
,
their
energy
,
their
practical
*NL*
sense
and
frank
liberality
have
afforded
an
unknown
and
unrecommended
*NL*
Author
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Press
and
the
Public
are
but
vague
personifications
for
me
,
and
I
*NL*
must
thank
them
in
vague
terms
;
but
my
Publishers
are
definite
:
so
are
*NL*
certain
generous
critics
who
have
encouraged
me
as
only
large-hearted
and
*NL*
high-minded
men
know
how
to
encourage
a
struggling
stranger
;
to
them
,
*NL*
_
i.e.
_
,
to
my
Publishers
and
the
select
Reviewers
,
I
say
cordially
,
*NL*
Gentlemen
,
I
thank
you
from
my
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
thus
acknowledged
what
I
owe
those
who
have
aided
and
approved
me
,
*NL*
I
turn
to
another
class
;
a
small
one
,
so
far
as
I
know
,
but
not
,
*NL*
therefore
,
to
be
overlooked
.
I
mean
the
timorous
or
carping
few
who
*NL*
doubt
the
tendency
of
such
books
as
``
Jane
Eyre
:
''
in
whose
eyes
whatever
*NL*
is
unusual
is
wrong
;
whose
ears
detect
in
each
protest
against
*NL*
bigotry
--
that
parent
of
crime
--
an
insult
to
piety
,
that
regent
of
God
on
*NL*
earth
.
I
would
suggest
to
such
doubters
certain
obvious
distinctions
;
I
*NL*
would
remind
them
of
certain
simple
truths
.
*NL*
*NL*
Conventionality
is
not
morality
.
Self-righteousness
is
not
religion
.
To
*NL*
attack
the
first
is
not
to
assail
the
last
.
To
pluck
the
mask
from
the
*NL*
face
of
the
Pharisee
,
is
not
to
lift
an
impious
hand
to
the
Crown
of
*NL*
Thorns
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
things
and
deeds
are
diametrically
opposed
:
they
are
as
distinct
as
*NL*
is
vice
from
virtue
.
Men
too
often
confound
them
:
they
should
not
be
*NL*
confounded
:
appearance
should
not
be
mistaken
for
truth
;
narrow
human
*NL*
doctrines
,
that
only
tend
to
elate
and
magnify
a
few
,
should
not
be
*NL*
substituted
for
the
world-redeeming
creed
of
Christ
.
There
is
--
I
repeat
*NL*
it
--
a
difference
;
and
it
is
a
good
,
and
not
a
bad
action
to
mark
broadly
*NL*
and
clearly
the
line
of
separation
between
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
world
may
not
like
to
see
these
ideas
dissevered
,
for
it
has
been
*NL*
accustomed
to
blend
them
;
finding
it
convenient
to
make
external
show
*NL*
pass
for
sterling
worth
--
to
let
white-washed
walls
vouch
for
clean
*NL*
shrines
.
It
may
hate
him
who
dares
to
scrutinise
and
expose
--
to
rase
the
*NL*
gilding
,
and
show
base
metal
under
it
--
to
penetrate
the
sepulchre
,
and
*NL*
reveal
charnel
relics
:
but
hate
as
it
will
,
it
is
indebted
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ahab
did
not
like
Micaiah
,
because
he
never
prophesied
good
concerning
*NL*
him
,
but
evil
;
probably
he
liked
the
sycophant
son
of
Chenaannah
better
;
*NL*
yet
might
Ahab
have
escaped
a
bloody
death
,
had
he
but
stopped
his
ears
*NL*
to
flattery
,
and
opened
them
to
faithful
counsel
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
a
man
in
our
own
days
whose
words
are
not
framed
to
tickle
*NL*
delicate
ears
:
who
,
to
my
thinking
,
comes
before
the
great
ones
of
*NL*
society
,
much
as
the
son
of
Imlah
came
before
the
throned
Kings
of
Judah
*NL*
and
Israel
;
and
who
speaks
truth
as
deep
,
with
a
power
as
prophet-like
*NL*
and
as
vital
--
a
mien
as
dauntless
and
as
daring
.
Is
the
satirist
of
*NL*
``
Vanity
Fair
''
admired
in
high
places
?
I
can
not
tell
;
but
I
think
if
some
*NL*
of
those
amongst
whom
he
hurls
the
Greek
fire
of
his
sarcasm
,
and
over
*NL*
whom
he
flashes
the
levin-brand
of
his
denunciation
,
were
to
take
his
*NL*
warnings
in
time
--
they
or
their
seed
might
yet
escape
a
fatal
*NL*
Rimoth-Gilead
.
*NL*
*NL*
Why
have
I
alluded
to
this
man
?
I
have
alluded
to
him
,
Reader
,
because
I
*NL*
think
I
see
in
him
an
intellect
profounder
and
more
unique
than
his
*NL*
contemporaries
have
yet
recognised
;
because
I
regard
him
as
the
first
*NL*
social
regenerator
of
the
day
--
as
the
very
master
of
that
working
corps
*NL*
who
would
restore
to
rectitude
the
warped
system
of
things
;
because
I
*NL*
think
no
commentator
on
his
writings
has
yet
found
the
comparison
that
*NL*
suits
him
,
the
terms
which
rightly
characterise
his
talent
.
They
say
he
*NL*
is
like
Fielding
:
they
talk
of
his
wit
,
humour
,
comic
powers
.
He
*NL*
resembles
Fielding
as
an
eagle
does
a
vulture
:
Fielding
could
stoop
on
*NL*
carrion
,
but
Thackeray
never
does
.
His
wit
is
bright
,
his
humour
*NL*
attractive
,
but
both
bear
the
same
relation
to
his
serious
genius
that
*NL*
the
mere
lambent
sheet-lightning
playing
under
the
edge
of
the
summer
-
*NL*
cloud
does
to
the
electric
death-spark
hid
in
its
womb
.
Finally
,
I
have
*NL*
alluded
to
Mr.
Thackeray
,
because
to
him
--
if
he
will
accept
the
tribute
*NL*
of
a
total
stranger
--
I
have
dedicated

second
edition

NOTE
TO
THE
THIRD
EDITION
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
avail
myself
of
the
opportunity
which
a
third
edition
of
``
Jane
Eyre
''
*NL*
affords
me
,
of
again
addressing
a
word
to
the
Public
,
to
explain
that
my
*NL*
claim
to
the
title
of
novelist
rests
on
this
one
work
alone
.
If
,
*NL*
therefore
,
the
authorship
of
other
works
of
fiction
has
been
attributed
*NL*
to
me
,
an
honour
is
awarded
where
it
is
not
merited
;
and
consequently
,
*NL*
denied
where
it
is
justly
due
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
explanation
will
serve
to
rectify
mistakes
which
may
already
have
*NL*
been
made
,
and
to
prevent
future
errors
.

CHAPTER
I
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
possibility
of
taking
a
walk
that
day
.
We
had
been
*NL*
wandering
,
indeed
,
in
the
leafless
shrubbery
an
hour
in
the
morning
;
but
*NL*
since
dinner
-LRB-
Mrs.
Reed
,
when
there
was
no
company
,
dined
early
-RRB-
the
cold
*NL*
winter
wind
had
brought
with
it
clouds
so
sombre
,
and
a
rain
so
*NL*
penetrating
,
that
further
out-door
exercise
was
now
out
of
the
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
glad
of
it
:
I
never
liked
long
walks
,
especially
on
chilly
*NL*
afternoons
:
dreadful
to
me
was
the
coming
home
in
the
raw
twilight
,
with
*NL*
nipped
fingers
and
toes
,
and
a
heart
saddened
by
the
chidings
of
Bessie
,
*NL*
the
nurse
,
and
humbled
by
the
consciousness
of
my
physical
inferiority
to
*NL*
Eliza
,
John
,
and
Georgiana
Reed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
said
Eliza
,
John
,
and
Georgiana
were
now
clustered
round
their
mama
*NL*
in
the
drawing-room
:
she
lay
reclined
on
a
sofa
by
the
fireside
,
and
with
*NL*
her
darlings
about
her
-LRB-
for
the
time
neither
quarrelling
nor
crying
-RRB-
*NL*
looked
perfectly
happy
.
Me
,
she
had
dispensed
from
joining
the
group
;
*NL*
saying
,
``
She
regretted
to
be
under
the
necessity
of
keeping
me
at
a
*NL*
distance
;
but
that
until
she
heard
from
Bessie
,
and
could
discover
by
her
*NL*
own
observation
,
that
I
was
endeavouring
in
good
earnest
to
acquire
a
*NL*
more
sociable
and
childlike
disposition
,
a
more
attractive
and
sprightly
*NL*
manner
--
something
lighter
,
franker
,
more
natural
,
as
it
were
--
she
really
*NL*
must
exclude
me
from
privileges
intended
only
for
contented
,
happy
,
*NL*
little
children
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
Bessie
say
I
have
done
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jane
,
I
do
n't
like
cavillers
or
questioners
;
besides
,
there
is
something
*NL*
truly
forbidding
in
a
child
taking
up
her
elders
in
that
manner
.
Be
*NL*
seated
somewhere
;
and
until
you
can
speak
pleasantly
,
remain
silent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
breakfast-room
adjoined
the
drawing-room
,
I
slipped
in
there
.
It
*NL*
contained
a
bookcase
:
I
soon
possessed
myself
of
a
volume
,
taking
care
*NL*
that
it
should
be
one
stored
with
pictures
.
I
mounted
into
the
window
-
*NL*
seat
:
gathering
up
my
feet
,
I
sat
cross-legged
,
like
a
Turk
;
and
,
having
*NL*
drawn
the
red
moreen
curtain
nearly
close
,
I
was
shrined
in
double
*NL*
retirement
.
*NL*
*NL*
Folds
of
scarlet
drapery
shut
in
my
view
to
the
right
hand
;
to
the
left
*NL*
were
the
clear
panes
of
glass
,
protecting
,
but
not
separating
me
from
the
*NL*
drear
November
day
.
At
intervals
,
while
turning
over
the
leaves
of
my
*NL*
book
,
I
studied
the
aspect
of
that
winter
afternoon
.
Afar
,
it
offered
a
*NL*
pale
blank
of
mist
and
cloud
;
near
a
scene
of
wet
lawn
and
storm-beat
*NL*
shrub
,
with
ceaseless
rain
sweeping
away
wildly
before
a
long
and
*NL*
lamentable
blast
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
returned
to
my
book
--
Bewick
's
History
of
British
Birds
:
the
letterpress
*NL*
thereof
I
cared
little
for
,
generally
speaking
;
and
yet
there
were
*NL*
certain
introductory
pages
that
,
child
as
I
was
,
I
could
not
pass
quite
*NL*
as
a
blank
.
They
were
those
which
treat
of
the
haunts
of
sea-fowl
;
of
*NL*
``
the
solitary
rocks
and
promontories
''
by
them
only
inhabited
;
of
the
*NL*
coast
of
Norway
,
studded
with
isles
from
its
southern
extremity
,
the
*NL*
Lindeness
,
or
Naze
,
to
the
North
Cape
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
the
Northern
Ocean
,
in
vast
whirls
,
*NL*
Boils
round
the
naked
,
melancholy
isles
*NL*
Of
farthest
Thule
;
and
the
Atlantic
surge
*NL*
Pours
in
among
the
stormy
Hebrides
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nor
could
I
pass
unnoticed
the
suggestion
of
the
bleak
shores
of
Lapland
,
*NL*
Siberia
,
Spitzbergen
,
Nova
Zembla
,
Iceland
,
Greenland
,
with
``
the
vast
*NL*
sweep
of
the
Arctic
Zone
,
and
those
forlorn
regions
of
dreary
space
,
--
that
*NL*
reservoir
of
frost
and
snow
,
where
firm
fields
of
ice
,
the
accumulation
*NL*
of
centuries
of
winters
,
glazed
in
Alpine
heights
above
heights
,
surround
*NL*
the
pole
,
and
concentre
the
multiplied
rigours
of
extreme
cold
.
''
Of
*NL*
these
death-white
realms
I
formed
an
idea
of
my
own
:
shadowy
,
like
all
*NL*
the
half-comprehended
notions
that
float
dim
through
children
's
brains
,
*NL*
but
strangely
impressive
.
The
words
in
these
introductory
pages
*NL*
connected
themselves
with
the
succeeding
vignettes
,
and
gave
significance
*NL*
to
the
rock
standing
up
alone
in
a
sea
of
billow
and
spray
;
to
the
broken
*NL*
boat
stranded
on
a
desolate
coast
;
to
the
cold
and
ghastly
moon
glancing
*NL*
through
bars
of
cloud
at
a
wreck
just
sinking
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
can
not
tell
what
sentiment
haunted
the
quite
solitary
churchyard
,
with
*NL*
its
inscribed
headstone
;
its
gate
,
its
two
trees
,
its
low
horizon
,
*NL*
girdled
by
a
broken
wall
,
and
its
newly-risen
crescent
,
attesting
the
*NL*
hour
of
eventide
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
ships
becalmed
on
a
torpid
sea
,
I
believed
to
be
marine
phantoms
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fiend
pinning
down
the
thief
's
pack
behind
him
,
I
passed
over
*NL*
quickly
:
it
was
an
object
of
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
was
the
black
horned
thing
seated
aloof
on
a
rock
,
surveying
a
distant
*NL*
crowd
surrounding
a
gallows
.
*NL*
*NL*
Each
picture
told
a
story
;
mysterious
often
to
my
undeveloped
*NL*
understanding
and
imperfect
feelings
,
yet
ever
profoundly
interesting
:
as
*NL*
interesting
as
the
tales
Bessie
sometimes
narrated
on
winter
evenings
,
*NL*
when
she
chanced
to
be
in
good
humour
;
and
when
,
having
brought
her
*NL*
ironing-table
to
the
nursery
hearth
,
she
allowed
us
to
sit
about
it
,
and
*NL*
while
she
got
up
Mrs.
Reed
's
lace
frills
,
and
crimped
her
nightcap
*NL*
borders
,
fed
our
eager
attention
with
passages
of
love
and
adventure
*NL*
taken
from
old
fairy
tales
and
other
ballads
;
or
-LRB-
as
at
a
later
period
I
*NL*
discovered
-RRB-
from
the
pages
of
Pamela
,
and
Henry
,
Earl
of
Moreland
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
Bewick
on
my
knee
,
I
was
then
happy
:
happy
at
least
in
my
way
.
I
*NL*
feared
nothing
but
interruption
,
and
that
came
too
soon
.
The
breakfast
-
*NL*
room
door
opened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Boh
!
Madam
Mope
!
''
cried
the
voice
of
John
Reed
;
then
he
paused
:
he
*NL*
found
the
room
apparently
empty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
the
dickens
is
she
!
''
he
continued
.
``
Lizzy
!
Georgy
!
-LRB-
calling
to
*NL*
his
sisters
-RRB-
Joan
is
not
here
:
tell
mama
she
is
run
out
into
the
rain
--
bad
*NL*
animal
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
well
I
drew
the
curtain
,
''
thought
I
;
and
I
wished
fervently
he
*NL*
might
not
discover
my
hiding-place
:
nor
would
John
Reed
have
found
it
out
*NL*
himself
;
he
was
not
quick
either
of
vision
or
conception
;
but
Eliza
just
*NL*
put
her
head
in
at
the
door
,
and
said
at
once
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
in
the
window-seat
,
to
be
sure
,
Jack
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
I
came
out
immediately
,
for
I
trembled
at
the
idea
of
being
dragged
*NL*
forth
by
the
said
Jack
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
?
''
I
asked
,
with
awkward
diffidence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
`
What
do
you
want
,
Master
Reed
?
'
''
was
the
answer
.
``
I
want
you
to
*NL*
come
here
;
''
and
seating
himself
in
an
arm-chair
,
he
intimated
by
a
*NL*
gesture
that
I
was
to
approach
and
stand
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
John
Reed
was
a
schoolboy
of
fourteen
years
old
;
four
years
older
than
I
,
*NL*
for
I
was
but
ten
:
large
and
stout
for
his
age
,
with
a
dingy
and
*NL*
unwholesome
skin
;
thick
lineaments
in
a
spacious
visage
,
heavy
limbs
and
*NL*
large
extremities
.
He
gorged
himself
habitually
at
table
,
which
made
him
*NL*
bilious
,
and
gave
him
a
dim
and
bleared
eye
and
flabby
cheeks
.
He
ought
*NL*
now
to
have
been
at
school
;
but
his
mama
had
taken
him
home
for
a
month
*NL*
or
two
,
``
on
account
of
his
delicate
health
.
''
Mr.
Miles
,
the
master
,
*NL*
affirmed
that
he
would
do
very
well
if
he
had
fewer
cakes
and
sweetmeats
*NL*
sent
him
from
home
;
but
the
mother
's
heart
turned
from
an
opinion
so
*NL*
harsh
,
and
inclined
rather
to
the
more
refined
idea
that
John
's
*NL*
sallowness
was
owing
to
over-application
and
,
perhaps
,
to
pining
after
*NL*
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
John
had
not
much
affection
for
his
mother
and
sisters
,
and
an
antipathy
*NL*
to
me
.
He
bullied
and
punished
me
;
not
two
or
three
times
in
the
week
,
*NL*
nor
once
or
twice
in
the
day
,
but
continually
:
every
nerve
I
had
feared
*NL*
him
,
and
every
morsel
of
flesh
in
my
bones
shrank
when
he
came
near
.
*NL*
There
were
moments
when
I
was
bewildered
by
the
terror
he
inspired
,
*NL*
because
I
had
no
appeal
whatever
against
either
his
menaces
or
his
*NL*
inflictions
;
the
servants
did
not
like
to
offend
their
young
master
by
*NL*
taking
my
part
against
him
,
and
Mrs.
Reed
was
blind
and
deaf
on
the
*NL*
subject
:
she
never
saw
him
strike
or
heard
him
abuse
me
,
though
he
did
*NL*
both
now
and
then
in
her
very
presence
,
more
frequently
,
however
,
behind
*NL*
her
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
Habitually
obedient
to
John
,
I
came
up
to
his
chair
:
he
spent
some
three
*NL*
minutes
in
thrusting
out
his
tongue
at
me
as
far
as
he
could
without
*NL*
damaging
the
roots
:
I
knew
he
would
soon
strike
,
and
while
dreading
the
*NL*
blow
,
I
mused
on
the
disgusting
and
ugly
appearance
of
him
who
would
*NL*
presently
deal
it
.
I
wonder
if
he
read
that
notion
in
my
face
;
for
,
all
*NL*
at
once
,
without
speaking
,
he
struck
suddenly
and
strongly
.
I
tottered
,
*NL*
and
on
regaining
my
equilibrium
retired
back
a
step
or
two
from
his
*NL*
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
for
your
impudence
in
answering
mama
awhile
since
,
''
said
he
,
*NL*
``
and
for
your
sneaking
way
of
getting
behind
curtains
,
and
for
the
look
*NL*
you
had
in
your
eyes
two
minutes
since
,
you
rat
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Accustomed
to
John
Reed
's
abuse
,
I
never
had
an
idea
of
replying
to
it
;
*NL*
my
care
was
how
to
endure
the
blow
which
would
certainly
follow
the
*NL*
insult
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
were
you
doing
behind
the
curtain
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
reading
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Show
the
book
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
returned
to
the
window
and
fetched
it
thence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
no
business
to
take
our
books
;
you
are
a
dependent
,
mama
says
;
*NL*
you
have
no
money
;
your
father
left
you
none
;
you
ought
to
beg
,
and
not
*NL*
to
live
here
with
gentlemen
's
children
like
us
,
and
eat
the
same
meals
we
*NL*
do
,
and
wear
clothes
at
our
mama
's
expense
.
Now
,
I
'll
teach
you
to
*NL*
rummage
my
bookshelves
:
for
they
_
are
_
mine
;
all
the
house
belongs
to
me
,
*NL*
or
will
do
in
a
few
years
.
Go
and
stand
by
the
door
,
out
of
the
way
of
*NL*
the
mirror
and
the
windows
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
so
,
not
at
first
aware
what
was
his
intention
;
but
when
I
saw
him
*NL*
lift
and
poise
the
book
and
stand
in
act
to
hurl
it
,
I
instinctively
*NL*
started
aside
with
a
cry
of
alarm
:
not
soon
enough
,
however
;
the
volume
*NL*
was
flung
,
it
hit
me
,
and
I
fell
,
striking
my
head
against
the
door
and
*NL*
cutting
it
.
The
cut
bled
,
the
pain
was
sharp
:
my
terror
had
passed
its
*NL*
climax
;
other
feelings
succeeded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wicked
and
cruel
boy
!
''
I
said
.
``
You
are
like
a
murderer
--
you
are
like
a
*NL*
slave-driver
--
you
are
like
the
Roman
emperors
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
read
Goldsmith
's
History
of
Rome
,
and
had
formed
my
opinion
of
*NL*
Nero
,
Caligula
,
etc.
.
Also
I
had
drawn
parallels
in
silence
,
which
I
never
*NL*
thought
thus
to
have
declared
aloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
what
!
''
he
cried
.
``
Did
she
say
that
to
me
?
Did
you
hear
her
,
*NL*
Eliza
and
Georgiana
?
Wo
n't
I
tell
mama
?
but
first
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
ran
headlong
at
me
:
I
felt
him
grasp
my
hair
and
my
shoulder
:
he
had
*NL*
closed
with
a
desperate
thing
.
I
really
saw
in
him
a
tyrant
,
a
murderer
.
*NL*
I
felt
a
drop
or
two
of
blood
from
my
head
trickle
down
my
neck
,
and
was
*NL*
sensible
of
somewhat
pungent
suffering
:
these
sensations
for
the
time
*NL*
predominated
over
fear
,
and
I
received
him
in
frantic
sort
.
I
do
n't
very
*NL*
well
know
what
I
did
with
my
hands
,
but
he
called
me
``
Rat
!
Rat
!
''
and
*NL*
bellowed
out
aloud
.
Aid
was
near
him
:
Eliza
and
Georgiana
had
run
for
*NL*
Mrs.
Reed
,
who
was
gone
upstairs
:
she
now
came
upon
the
scene
,
followed
*NL*
by
Bessie
and
her
maid
Abbot
.
We
were
parted
:
I
heard
the
words
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
!
dear
!
What
a
fury
to
fly
at
Master
John
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
ever
anybody
see
such
a
picture
of
passion
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Mrs.
Reed
subjoined
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
her
away
to
the
red-room
,
and
lock
her
in
there
.
''
Four
hands
were
*NL*
immediately
laid
upon
me
,
and
I
was
borne
upstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
resisted
all
the
way
:
a
new
thing
for
me
,
and
a
circumstance
which
*NL*
greatly
strengthened
the
bad
opinion
Bessie
and
Miss
Abbot
were
disposed
*NL*
to
entertain
of
me
.
The
fact
is
,
I
was
a
trifle
beside
myself
;
or
rather
*NL*
_
out
_
of
myself
,
as
the
French
would
say
:
I
was
conscious
that
a
moment
's
*NL*
mutiny
had
already
rendered
me
liable
to
strange
penalties
,
and
,
like
any
*NL*
other
rebel
slave
,
I
felt
resolved
,
in
my
desperation
,
to
go
all
lengths
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
her
arms
,
Miss
Abbot
:
she
's
like
a
mad
cat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
shame
!
for
shame
!
''
cried
the
lady
's
-
maid
.
``
What
shocking
conduct
,
*NL*
Miss
Eyre
,
to
strike
a
young
gentleman
,
your
benefactress
's
son
!
Your
*NL*
young
master
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Master
!
How
is
he
my
master
?
Am
I
a
servant
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
you
are
less
than
a
servant
,
for
you
do
nothing
for
your
keep
.
*NL*
There
,
sit
down
,
and
think
over
your
wickedness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
got
me
by
this
time
into
the
apartment
indicated
by
Mrs.
Reed
,
*NL*
and
had
thrust
me
upon
a
stool
:
my
impulse
was
to
rise
from
it
like
a
*NL*
spring
;
their
two
pair
of
hands
arrested
me
instantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
do
n't
sit
still
,
you
must
be
tied
down
,
''
said
Bessie
.
``
Miss
*NL*
Abbot
,
lend
me
your
garters
;
she
would
break
mine
directly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Abbot
turned
to
divest
a
stout
leg
of
the
necessary
ligature
.
This
*NL*
preparation
for
bonds
,
and
the
additional
ignominy
it
inferred
,
took
a
*NL*
little
of
the
excitement
out
of
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
take
them
off
,
''
I
cried
;
``
I
will
not
stir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
guarantee
whereof
,
I
attached
myself
to
my
seat
by
my
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mind
you
do
n't
,
''
said
Bessie
;
and
when
she
had
ascertained
that
I
was
*NL*
really
subsiding
,
she
loosened
her
hold
of
me
;
then
she
and
Miss
Abbot
*NL*
stood
with
folded
arms
,
looking
darkly
and
doubtfully
on
my
face
,
as
*NL*
incredulous
of
my
sanity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
never
did
so
before
,
''
at
last
said
Bessie
,
turning
to
the
Abigail
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
was
always
in
her
,
''
was
the
reply
.
``
I
've
told
Missis
often
my
*NL*
opinion
about
the
child
,
and
Missis
agreed
with
me
.
She
's
an
underhand
*NL*
little
thing
:
I
never
saw
a
girl
of
her
age
with
so
much
cover
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bessie
answered
not
;
but
ere
long
,
addressing
me
,
she
said
--
``
You
ought
to
*NL*
be
aware
,
Miss
,
that
you
are
under
obligations
to
Mrs.
Reed
:
she
keeps
*NL*
you
:
if
she
were
to
turn
you
off
,
you
would
have
to
go
to
the
poorhouse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
nothing
to
say
to
these
words
:
they
were
not
new
to
me
:
my
very
*NL*
first
recollections
of
existence
included
hints
of
the
same
kind
.
This
*NL*
reproach
of
my
dependence
had
become
a
vague
sing-song
in
my
ear
:
very
*NL*
painful
and
crushing
,
but
only
half
intelligible
.
Miss
Abbot
joined
in
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
ought
not
to
think
yourself
on
an
equality
with
the
Misses
Reed
*NL*
and
Master
Reed
,
because
Missis
kindly
allows
you
to
be
brought
up
with
*NL*
them
.
They
will
have
a
great
deal
of
money
,
and
you
will
have
none
:
it
*NL*
is
your
place
to
be
humble
,
and
to
try
to
make
yourself
agreeable
to
*NL*
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
we
tell
you
is
for
your
good
,
''
added
Bessie
,
in
no
harsh
voice
,
*NL*
``
you
should
try
to
be
useful
and
pleasant
,
then
,
perhaps
,
you
would
have
*NL*
a
home
here
;
but
if
you
become
passionate
and
rude
,
Missis
will
send
you
*NL*
away
,
I
am
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Besides
,
''
said
Miss
Abbot
,
``
God
will
punish
her
:
He
might
strike
her
*NL*
dead
in
the
midst
of
her
tantrums
,
and
then
where
would
she
go
?
Come
,
*NL*
Bessie
,
we
will
leave
her
:
I
would
n't
have
her
heart
for
anything
.
Say
*NL*
your
prayers
,
Miss
Eyre
,
when
you
are
by
yourself
;
for
if
you
do
n't
*NL*
repent
,
something
bad
might
be
permitted
to
come
down
the
chimney
and
*NL*
fetch
you
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
,
shutting
the
door
,
and
locking
it
behind
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
red-room
was
a
square
chamber
,
very
seldom
slept
in
,
I
might
say
*NL*
never
,
indeed
,
unless
when
a
chance
influx
of
visitors
at
Gateshead
Hall
*NL*
rendered
it
necessary
to
turn
to
account
all
the
accommodation
it
*NL*
contained
:
yet
it
was
one
of
the
largest
and
stateliest
chambers
in
the
*NL*
mansion
.
A
bed
supported
on
massive
pillars
of
mahogany
,
hung
with
*NL*
curtains
of
deep
red
damask
,
stood
out
like
a
tabernacle
in
the
centre
;
*NL*
the
two
large
windows
,
with
their
blinds
always
drawn
down
,
were
half
*NL*
shrouded
in
festoons
and
falls
of
similar
drapery
;
the
carpet
was
red
;
*NL*
the
table
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
was
covered
with
a
crimson
cloth
;
the
*NL*
walls
were
a
soft
fawn
colour
with
a
blush
of
pink
in
it
;
the
wardrobe
,
*NL*
the
toilet-table
,
the
chairs
were
of
darkly
polished
old
mahogany
.
Out
*NL*
of
these
deep
surrounding
shades
rose
high
,
and
glared
white
,
the
piled
-
*NL*
up
mattresses
and
pillows
of
the
bed
,
spread
with
a
snowy
Marseilles
*NL*
counterpane
.
Scarcely
less
prominent
was
an
ample
cushioned
easy-chair
*NL*
near
the
head
of
the
bed
,
also
white
,
with
a
footstool
before
it
;
and
*NL*
looking
,
as
I
thought
,
like
a
pale
throne
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
room
was
chill
,
because
it
seldom
had
a
fire
;
it
was
silent
,
because
*NL*
remote
from
the
nursery
and
kitchen
;
solemn
,
because
it
was
known
to
be
*NL*
so
seldom
entered
.
The
house-maid
alone
came
here
on
Saturdays
,
to
wipe
*NL*
from
the
mirrors
and
the
furniture
a
week
's
quiet
dust
:
and
Mrs.
Reed
*NL*
herself
,
at
far
intervals
,
visited
it
to
review
the
contents
of
a
certain
*NL*
secret
drawer
in
the
wardrobe
,
where
were
stored
divers
parchments
,
her
*NL*
jewel-casket
,
and
a
miniature
of
her
deceased
husband
;
and
in
those
last
*NL*
words
lies
the
secret
of
the
red-room
--
the
spell
which
kept
it
so
lonely
*NL*
in
spite
of
its
grandeur
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Reed
had
been
dead
nine
years
:
it
was
in
this
chamber
he
breathed
his
*NL*
last
;
here
he
lay
in
state
;
hence
his
coffin
was
borne
by
the
*NL*
undertaker
's
men
;
and
,
since
that
day
,
a
sense
of
dreary
consecration
had
*NL*
guarded
it
from
frequent
intrusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
seat
,
to
which
Bessie
and
the
bitter
Miss
Abbot
had
left
me
riveted
,
*NL*
was
a
low
ottoman
near
the
marble
chimney-piece
;
the
bed
rose
before
me
;
*NL*
to
my
right
hand
there
was
the
high
,
dark
wardrobe
,
with
subdued
,
broken
*NL*
reflections
varying
the
gloss
of
its
panels
;
to
my
left
were
the
muffled
*NL*
windows
;
a
great
looking-glass
between
them
repeated
the
vacant
majesty
*NL*
of
the
bed
and
room
.
I
was
not
quite
sure
whether
they
had
locked
the
*NL*
door
;
and
when
I
dared
move
,
I
got
up
and
went
to
see
.
Alas
!
yes
:
no
*NL*
jail
was
ever
more
secure
.
Returning
,
I
had
to
cross
before
the
looking
-
*NL*
glass
;
my
fascinated
glance
involuntarily
explored
the
depth
it
revealed
.
*NL*
All
looked
colder
and
darker
in
that
visionary
hollow
than
in
reality
:
*NL*
and
the
strange
little
figure
there
gazing
at
me
,
with
a
white
face
and
*NL*
arms
specking
the
gloom
,
and
glittering
eyes
of
fear
moving
where
all
*NL*
else
was
still
,
had
the
effect
of
a
real
spirit
:
I
thought
it
like
one
of
*NL*
the
tiny
phantoms
,
half
fairy
,
half
imp
,
Bessie
's
evening
stories
*NL*
represented
as
coming
out
of
lone
,
ferny
dells
in
moors
,
and
appearing
*NL*
before
the
eyes
of
belated
travellers
.
I
returned
to
my
stool
.
*NL*
*NL*
Superstition
was
with
me
at
that
moment
;
but
it
was
not
yet
her
hour
for
*NL*
complete
victory
:
my
blood
was
still
warm
;
the
mood
of
the
revolted
slave
*NL*
was
still
bracing
me
with
its
bitter
vigour
;
I
had
to
stem
a
rapid
rush
*NL*
of
retrospective
thought
before
I
quailed
to
the
dismal
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
John
Reed
's
violent
tyrannies
,
all
his
sisters
'
proud
indifference
,
*NL*
all
his
mother
's
aversion
,
all
the
servants
'
partiality
,
turned
up
in
my
*NL*
disturbed
mind
like
a
dark
deposit
in
a
turbid
well
.
Why
was
I
always
*NL*
suffering
,
always
browbeaten
,
always
accused
,
for
ever
condemned
?
Why
*NL*
could
I
never
please
?
Why
was
it
useless
to
try
to
win
any
one
's
favour
?
*NL*
Eliza
,
who
was
headstrong
and
selfish
,
was
respected
.
Georgiana
,
who
had
*NL*
a
spoiled
temper
,
a
very
acrid
spite
,
a
captious
and
insolent
carriage
,
*NL*
was
universally
indulged
.
Her
beauty
,
her
pink
cheeks
and
golden
curls
,
*NL*
seemed
to
give
delight
to
all
who
looked
at
her
,
and
to
purchase
*NL*
indemnity
for
every
fault
.
John
no
one
thwarted
,
much
less
punished
;
*NL*
though
he
twisted
the
necks
of
the
pigeons
,
killed
the
little
pea-chicks
,
*NL*
set
the
dogs
at
the
sheep
,
stripped
the
hothouse
vines
of
their
fruit
,
*NL*
and
broke
the
buds
off
the
choicest
plants
in
the
conservatory
:
he
called
*NL*
his
mother
``
old
girl
,
''
too
;
sometimes
reviled
her
for
her
dark
skin
,
*NL*
similar
to
his
own
;
bluntly
disregarded
her
wishes
;
not
unfrequently
tore
*NL*
and
spoiled
her
silk
attire
;
and
he
was
still
``
her
own
darling
.
''
I
dared
*NL*
commit
no
fault
:
I
strove
to
fulfil
every
duty
;
and
I
was
termed
naughty
*NL*
and
tiresome
,
sullen
and
sneaking
,
from
morning
to
noon
,
and
from
noon
to
*NL*
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
head
still
ached
and
bled
with
the
blow
and
fall
I
had
received
:
no
*NL*
one
had
reproved
John
for
wantonly
striking
me
;
and
because
I
had
turned
*NL*
against
him
to
avert
farther
irrational
violence
,
I
was
loaded
with
*NL*
general
opprobrium
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Unjust
!
--
unjust
!
''
said
my
reason
,
forced
by
the
agonising
stimulus
into
*NL*
precocious
though
transitory
power
:
and
Resolve
,
equally
wrought
up
,
*NL*
instigated
some
strange
expedient
to
achieve
escape
from
insupportable
*NL*
oppression
--
as
running
away
,
or
,
if
that
could
not
be
effected
,
never
*NL*
eating
or
drinking
more
,
and
letting
myself
die
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
a
consternation
of
soul
was
mine
that
dreary
afternoon
!
How
all
my
*NL*
brain
was
in
tumult
,
and
all
my
heart
in
insurrection
!
Yet
in
what
*NL*
darkness
,
what
dense
ignorance
,
was
the
mental
battle
fought
!
I
could
*NL*
not
answer
the
ceaseless
inward
question
--
_
why
_
I
thus
suffered
;
now
,
at
*NL*
the
distance
of
--
I
will
not
say
how
many
years
,
I
see
it
clearly
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
a
discord
in
Gateshead
Hall
:
I
was
like
nobody
there
;
I
had
nothing
*NL*
in
harmony
with
Mrs.
Reed
or
her
children
,
or
her
chosen
vassalage
.
If
*NL*
they
did
not
love
me
,
in
fact
,
as
little
did
I
love
them
.
They
were
not
*NL*
bound
to
regard
with
affection
a
thing
that
could
not
sympathise
with
one
*NL*
amongst
them
;
a
heterogeneous
thing
,
opposed
to
them
in
temperament
,
in
*NL*
capacity
,
in
propensities
;
a
useless
thing
,
incapable
of
serving
their
*NL*
interest
,
or
adding
to
their
pleasure
;
a
noxious
thing
,
cherishing
the
*NL*
germs
of
indignation
at
their
treatment
,
of
contempt
of
their
judgment
.
I
*NL*
know
that
had
I
been
a
sanguine
,
brilliant
,
careless
,
exacting
,
handsome
,
*NL*
romping
child
--
though
equally
dependent
and
friendless
--
Mrs.
Reed
would
*NL*
have
endured
my
presence
more
complacently
;
her
children
would
have
*NL*
entertained
for
me
more
of
the
cordiality
of
fellow-feeling
;
the
servants
*NL*
would
have
been
less
prone
to
make
me
the
scapegoat
of
the
nursery
.
*NL*
*NL*
Daylight
began
to
forsake
the
red-room
;
it
was
past
four
o'clock
,
and
the
*NL*
beclouded
afternoon
was
tending
to
drear
twilight
.
I
heard
the
rain
*NL*
still
beating
continuously
on
the
staircase
window
,
and
the
wind
howling
*NL*
in
the
grove
behind
the
hall
;
I
grew
by
degrees
cold
as
a
stone
,
and
then
*NL*
my
courage
sank
.
My
habitual
mood
of
humiliation
,
self-doubt
,
forlorn
*NL*
depression
,
fell
damp
on
the
embers
of
my
decaying
ire
.
All
said
I
was
*NL*
wicked
,
and
perhaps
I
might
be
so
;
what
thought
had
I
been
but
just
*NL*
conceiving
of
starving
myself
to
death
?
That
certainly
was
a
crime
:
and
*NL*
was
I
fit
to
die
?
Or
was
the
vault
under
the
chancel
of
Gateshead
Church
*NL*
an
inviting
bourne
?
In
such
vault
I
had
been
told
did
Mr.
Reed
lie
*NL*
buried
;
and
led
by
this
thought
to
recall
his
idea
,
I
dwelt
on
it
with
*NL*
gathering
dread
.
I
could
not
remember
him
;
but
I
knew
that
he
was
my
own
*NL*
uncle
--
my
mother
's
brother
--
that
he
had
taken
me
when
a
parentless
infant
*NL*
to
his
house
;
and
that
in
his
last
moments
he
had
required
a
promise
of
*NL*
Mrs.
Reed
that
she
would
rear
and
maintain
me
as
one
of
her
own
children
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Reed
probably
considered
she
had
kept
this
promise
;
and
so
she
had
,
*NL*
I
dare
say
,
as
well
as
her
nature
would
permit
her
;
but
how
could
she
*NL*
really
like
an
interloper
not
of
her
race
,
and
unconnected
with
her
,
*NL*
after
her
husband
's
death
,
by
any
tie
?
It
must
have
been
most
irksome
to
*NL*
find
herself
bound
by
a
hard-wrung
pledge
to
stand
in
the
stead
of
a
*NL*
parent
to
a
strange
child
she
could
not
love
,
and
to
see
an
uncongenial
*NL*
alien
permanently
intruded
on
her
own
family
group
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
singular
notion
dawned
upon
me
.
I
doubted
not
--
never
doubted
--
that
if
*NL*
Mr.
Reed
had
been
alive
he
would
have
treated
me
kindly
;
and
now
,
as
I
*NL*
sat
looking
at
the
white
bed
and
overshadowed
walls
--
occasionally
also
*NL*
turning
a
fascinated
eye
towards
the
dimly
gleaning
mirror
--
I
began
to
*NL*
recall
what
I
had
heard
of
dead
men
,
troubled
in
their
graves
by
the
*NL*
violation
of
their
last
wishes
,
revisiting
the
earth
to
punish
the
*NL*
perjured
and
avenge
the
oppressed
;
and
I
thought
Mr.
Reed
's
spirit
,
*NL*
harassed
by
the
wrongs
of
his
sister
's
child
,
might
quit
its
*NL*
abode
--
whether
in
the
church
vault
or
in
the
unknown
world
of
the
*NL*
departed
--
and
rise
before
me
in
this
chamber
.
I
wiped
my
tears
and
*NL*
hushed
my
sobs
,
fearful
lest
any
sign
of
violent
grief
might
waken
a
*NL*
preternatural
voice
to
comfort
me
,
or
elicit
from
the
gloom
some
haloed
*NL*
face
,
bending
over
me
with
strange
pity
.
This
idea
,
consolatory
in
*NL*
theory
,
I
felt
would
be
terrible
if
realised
:
with
all
my
might
I
*NL*
endeavoured
to
stifle
it
--
I
endeavoured
to
be
firm
.
Shaking
my
hair
from
*NL*
my
eyes
,
I
lifted
my
head
and
tried
to
look
boldly
round
the
dark
room
;
*NL*
at
this
moment
a
light
gleamed
on
the
wall
.
Was
it
,
I
asked
myself
,
a
*NL*
ray
from
the
moon
penetrating
some
aperture
in
the
blind
?
No
;
moonlight
*NL*
was
still
,
and
this
stirred
;
while
I
gazed
,
it
glided
up
to
the
ceiling
*NL*
and
quivered
over
my
head
.
I
can
now
conjecture
readily
that
this
streak
*NL*
of
light
was
,
in
all
likelihood
,
a
gleam
from
a
lantern
carried
by
some
*NL*
one
across
the
lawn
:
but
then
,
prepared
as
my
mind
was
for
horror
,
shaken
*NL*
as
my
nerves
were
by
agitation
,
I
thought
the
swift
darting
beam
was
a
*NL*
herald
of
some
coming
vision
from
another
world
.
My
heart
beat
thick
,
my
*NL*
head
grew
hot
;
a
sound
filled
my
ears
,
which
I
deemed
the
rushing
of
*NL*
wings
;
something
seemed
near
me
;
I
was
oppressed
,
suffocated
:
endurance
*NL*
broke
down
;
I
rushed
to
the
door
and
shook
the
lock
in
desperate
effort
.
*NL*
Steps
came
running
along
the
outer
passage
;
the
key
turned
,
Bessie
and
*NL*
Abbot
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Eyre
,
are
you
ill
?
''
said
Bessie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
dreadful
noise
!
it
went
quite
through
me
!
''
exclaimed
Abbot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
me
out
!
Let
me
go
into
the
nursery
!
''
was
my
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
for
?
Are
you
hurt
?
Have
you
seen
something
?
''
again
demanded
*NL*
Bessie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
I
saw
a
light
,
and
I
thought
a
ghost
would
come
.
''
I
had
now
got
*NL*
hold
of
Bessie
's
hand
,
and
she
did
not
snatch
it
from
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
screamed
out
on
purpose
,
''
declared
Abbot
,
in
some
disgust
.
``
And
*NL*
what
a
scream
!
If
she
had
been
in
great
pain
one
would
have
excused
it
,
*NL*
but
she
only
wanted
to
bring
us
all
here
:
I
know
her
naughty
tricks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
all
this
?
''
demanded
another
voice
peremptorily
;
and
Mrs.
Reed
*NL*
came
along
the
corridor
,
her
cap
flying
wide
,
her
gown
rustling
stormily
.
*NL*
``
Abbot
and
Bessie
,
I
believe
I
gave
orders
that
Jane
Eyre
should
be
left
*NL*
in
the
red-room
till
I
came
to
her
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Jane
screamed
so
loud
,
ma'am
,
''
pleaded
Bessie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
her
go
,
''
was
the
only
answer
.
``
Loose
Bessie
's
hand
,
child
:
you
*NL*
can
not
succeed
in
getting
out
by
these
means
,
be
assured
.
I
abhor
*NL*
artifice
,
particularly
in
children
;
it
is
my
duty
to
show
you
that
tricks
*NL*
will
not
answer
:
you
will
now
stay
here
an
hour
longer
,
and
it
is
only
on
*NL*
condition
of
perfect
submission
and
stillness
that
I
shall
liberate
you
*NL*
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
aunt
!
have
pity
!
Forgive
me
!
I
can
not
endure
it
--
let
me
be
punished
*NL*
some
other
way
!
I
shall
be
killed
if
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Silence
!
This
violence
is
all
most
repulsive
:
''
and
so
,
no
doubt
,
she
*NL*
felt
it
.
I
was
a
precocious
actress
in
her
eyes
;
she
sincerely
looked
on
*NL*
me
as
a
compound
of
virulent
passions
,
mean
spirit
,
and
dangerous
*NL*
duplicity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bessie
and
Abbot
having
retreated
,
Mrs.
Reed
,
impatient
of
my
now
frantic
*NL*
anguish
and
wild
sobs
,
abruptly
thrust
me
back
and
locked
me
in
,
without
*NL*
farther
parley
.
I
heard
her
sweeping
away
;
and
soon
after
she
was
gone
,
*NL*
I
suppose
I
had
a
species
of
fit
:
unconsciousness
closed
the
scene
.
*NL*

*NL*
CHAPTER
III
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
thing
I
remember
is
,
waking
up
with
a
feeling
as
if
I
had
had
a
*NL*
frightful
nightmare
,
and
seeing
before
me
a
terrible
red
glare
,
crossed
*NL*
with
thick
black
bars
.
I
heard
voices
,
too
,
speaking
with
a
hollow
*NL*
sound
,
and
as
if
muffled
by
a
rush
of
wind
or
water
:
agitation
,
*NL*
uncertainty
,
and
an
all-predominating
sense
of
terror
confused
my
*NL*
faculties
.
Ere
long
,
I
became
aware
that
some
one
was
handling
me
;
*NL*
lifting
me
up
and
supporting
me
in
a
sitting
posture
,
and
that
more
*NL*
tenderly
than
I
had
ever
been
raised
or
upheld
before
.
I
rested
my
head
*NL*
against
a
pillow
or
an
arm
,
and
felt
easy
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
five
minutes
more
the
cloud
of
bewilderment
dissolved
:
I
knew
quite
*NL*
well
that
I
was
in
my
own
bed
,
and
that
the
red
glare
was
the
nursery
*NL*
fire
.
It
was
night
:
a
candle
burnt
on
the
table
;
Bessie
stood
at
the
bed
-
*NL*
foot
with
a
basin
in
her
hand
,
and
a
gentleman
sat
in
a
chair
near
my
*NL*
pillow
,
leaning
over
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
an
inexpressible
relief
,
a
soothing
conviction
of
protection
and
*NL*
security
,
when
I
knew
that
there
was
a
stranger
in
the
room
,
an
*NL*
individual
not
belonging
to
Gateshead
,
and
not
related
to
Mrs.
Reed
.
*NL*
Turning
from
Bessie
-LRB-
though
her
presence
was
far
less
obnoxious
to
me
*NL*
than
that
of
Abbot
,
for
instance
,
would
have
been
-RRB-
,
I
scrutinised
the
*NL*
face
of
the
gentleman
:
I
knew
him
;
it
was
Mr.
Lloyd
,
an
apothecary
,
*NL*
sometimes
called
in
by
Mrs.
Reed
when
the
servants
were
ailing
:
for
*NL*
herself
and
the
children
she
employed
a
physician
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
who
am
I
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
pronounced
his
name
,
offering
him
at
the
same
time
my
hand
:
he
took
it
,
*NL*
smiling
and
saying
,
``
We
shall
do
very
well
by-and-by
.
''
Then
he
laid
me
*NL*
down
,
and
addressing
Bessie
,
charged
her
to
be
very
careful
that
I
was
*NL*
not
disturbed
during
the
night
.
Having
given
some
further
directions
,
*NL*
and
intimates
that
he
should
call
again
the
next
day
,
he
departed
;
to
my
*NL*
grief
:
I
felt
so
sheltered
and
befriended
while
he
sat
in
the
chair
near
*NL*
my
pillow
;
and
as
he
closed
the
door
after
him
,
all
the
room
darkened
and
*NL*
my
heart
again
sank
:
inexpressible
sadness
weighed
it
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
feel
as
if
you
should
sleep
,
Miss
?
''
asked
Bessie
,
rather
softly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Scarcely
dared
I
answer
her
;
for
I
feared
the
next
sentence
might
be
*NL*
rough
.
``
I
will
try
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
like
to
drink
,
or
could
you
eat
anything
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
thank
you
,
Bessie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
think
I
shall
go
to
bed
,
for
it
is
past
twelve
o'clock
;
but
you
*NL*
may
call
me
if
you
want
anything
in
the
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wonderful
civility
this
!
It
emboldened
me
to
ask
a
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bessie
,
what
is
the
matter
with
me
?
Am
I
ill
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
fell
sick
,
I
suppose
,
in
the
red-room
with
crying
;
you
'll
be
better
*NL*
soon
,
no
doubt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bessie
went
into
the
housemaid
's
apartment
,
which
was
near
.
I
heard
her
*NL*
say
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sarah
,
come
and
sleep
with
me
in
the
nursery
;
I
dare
n't
for
my
life
be
*NL*
alone
with
that
poor
child
to-night
:
she
might
die
;
it
's
such
a
strange
*NL*
thing
she
should
have
that
fit
:
I
wonder
if
she
saw
anything
.
Missis
was
*NL*
rather
too
hard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sarah
came
back
with
her
;
they
both
went
to
bed
;
they
were
whispering
*NL*
together
for
half-an-hour
before
they
fell
asleep
.
I
caught
scraps
of
*NL*
their
conversation
,
from
which
I
was
able
only
too
distinctly
to
infer
*NL*
the
main
subject
discussed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Something
passed
her
,
all
dressed
in
white
,
and
vanished
''
--
``
A
great
*NL*
black
dog
behind
him
''
--
``
Three
loud
raps
on
the
chamber
door
''
--
``
A
light
in
*NL*
the
churchyard
just
over
his
grave
,
''
etc.
,
etc.
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
both
slept
:
the
fire
and
the
candle
went
out
.
For
me
,
the
*NL*
watches
of
that
long
night
passed
in
ghastly
wakefulness
;
strained
by
*NL*
dread
:
such
dread
as
children
only
can
feel
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
severe
or
prolonged
bodily
illness
followed
this
incident
of
the
red
-
*NL*
room
;
it
only
gave
my
nerves
a
shock
of
which
I
feel
the
reverberation
to
*NL*
this
day
.
Yes
,
Mrs.
Reed
,
to
you
I
owe
some
fearful
pangs
of
mental
*NL*
suffering
,
but
I
ought
to
forgive
you
,
for
you
knew
not
what
you
did
:
*NL*
while
rending
my
heart-strings
,
you
thought
you
were
only
uprooting
my
*NL*
bad
propensities
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
,
by
noon
,
I
was
up
and
dressed
,
and
sat
wrapped
in
a
shawl
by
*NL*
the
nursery
hearth
.
I
felt
physically
weak
and
broken
down
:
but
my
worse
*NL*
ailment
was
an
unutterable
wretchedness
of
mind
:
a
wretchedness
which
*NL*
kept
drawing
from
me
silent
tears
;
no
sooner
had
I
wiped
one
salt
drop
*NL*
from
my
cheek
than
another
followed
.
Yet
,
I
thought
,
I
ought
to
have
*NL*
been
happy
,
for
none
of
the
Reeds
were
there
,
they
were
all
gone
out
in
*NL*
the
carriage
with
their
mama
.
Abbot
,
too
,
was
sewing
in
another
room
,
*NL*
and
Bessie
,
as
she
moved
hither
and
thither
,
putting
away
toys
and
*NL*
arranging
drawers
,
addressed
to
me
every
now
and
then
a
word
of
unwonted
*NL*
kindness
.
This
state
of
things
should
have
been
to
me
a
paradise
of
*NL*
peace
,
accustomed
as
I
was
to
a
life
of
ceaseless
reprimand
and
thankless
*NL*
fagging
;
but
,
in
fact
,
my
racked
nerves
were
now
in
such
a
state
that
no
*NL*
calm
could
soothe
,
and
no
pleasure
excite
them
agreeably
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bessie
had
been
down
into
the
kitchen
,
and
she
brought
up
with
her
a
tart
*NL*
on
a
certain
brightly
painted
china
plate
,
whose
bird
of
paradise
,
*NL*
nestling
in
a
wreath
of
convolvuli
and
rosebuds
,
had
been
wont
to
stir
in
*NL*
me
a
most
enthusiastic
sense
of
admiration
;
and
which
plate
I
had
often
*NL*
petitioned
to
be
allowed
to
take
in
my
hand
in
order
to
examine
it
more
*NL*
closely
,
but
had
always
hitherto
been
deemed
unworthy
of
such
a
*NL*
privilege
.
This
precious
vessel
was
now
placed
on
my
knee
,
and
I
was
*NL*
cordially
invited
to
eat
the
circlet
of
delicate
pastry
upon
it
.
Vain
*NL*
favour
!
coming
,
like
most
other
favours
long
deferred
and
often
wished
*NL*
for
,
too
late
!
I
could
not
eat
the
tart
;
and
the
plumage
of
the
bird
,
*NL*
the
tints
of
the
flowers
,
seemed
strangely
faded
:
I
put
both
plate
and
*NL*
tart
away
.
Bessie
asked
if
I
would
have
a
book
:
the
word
_
book
_
acted
as
*NL*
a
transient
stimulus
,
and
I
begged
her
to
fetch
Gulliver
's
Travels
from
*NL*
the
library
.
This
book
I
had
again
and
again
perused
with
delight
.
I
*NL*
considered
it
a
narrative
of
facts
,
and
discovered
in
it
a
vein
of
*NL*
interest
deeper
than
what
I
found
in
fairy
tales
:
for
as
to
the
elves
,
*NL*
having
sought
them
in
vain
among
foxglove
leaves
and
bells
,
under
*NL*
mushrooms
and
beneath
the
ground-ivy
mantling
old
wall-nooks
,
I
had
at
*NL*
length
made
up
my
mind
to
the
sad
truth
,
that
they
were
all
gone
out
of
*NL*
England
to
some
savage
country
where
the
woods
were
wilder
and
thicker
,
*NL*
and
the
population
more
scant
;
whereas
,
Lilliput
and
Brobdignag
being
,
in
*NL*
my
creed
,
solid
parts
of
the
earth
's
surface
,
I
doubted
not
that
I
might
*NL*
one
day
,
by
taking
a
long
voyage
,
see
with
my
own
eyes
the
little
fields
,
*NL*
houses
,
and
trees
,
the
diminutive
people
,
the
tiny
cows
,
sheep
,
and
birds
*NL*
of
the
one
realm
;
and
the
corn-fields
forest-high
,
the
mighty
mastiffs
,
*NL*
the
monster
cats
,
the
tower-like
men
and
women
,
of
the
other
.
Yet
,
when
*NL*
this
cherished
volume
was
now
placed
in
my
hand
--
when
I
turned
over
its
*NL*
leaves
,
and
sought
in
its
marvellous
pictures
the
charm
I
had
,
till
now
,
*NL*
never
failed
to
find
--
all
was
eerie
and
dreary
;
the
giants
were
gaunt
*NL*
goblins
,
the
pigmies
malevolent
and
fearful
imps
,
Gulliver
a
most
*NL*
desolate
wanderer
in
most
dread
and
dangerous
regions
.
I
closed
the
*NL*
book
,
which
I
dared
no
longer
peruse
,
and
put
it
on
the
table
,
beside
the
*NL*
untasted
tart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bessie
had
now
finished
dusting
and
tidying
the
room
,
and
having
washed
*NL*
her
hands
,
she
opened
a
certain
little
drawer
,
full
of
splendid
shreds
of
*NL*
silk
and
satin
,
and
began
making
a
new
bonnet
for
Georgiana
's
doll
.
*NL*
Meantime
she
sang
:
her
song
was
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
days
when
we
went
gipsying
,
*NL*
A
long
time
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
often
heard
the
song
before
,
and
always
with
lively
delight
;
for
*NL*
Bessie
had
a
sweet
voice
,
--
at
least
,
I
thought
so
.
But
now
,
though
her
*NL*
voice
was
still
sweet
,
I
found
in
its
melody
an
indescribable
sadness
.
*NL*
Sometimes
,
preoccupied
with
her
work
,
she
sang
the
refrain
very
low
,
very
*NL*
lingeringly
;
``
A
long
time
ago
''
came
out
like
the
saddest
cadence
of
a
*NL*
funeral
hymn
.
She
passed
into
another
ballad
,
this
time
a
really
doleful
*NL*
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
feet
they
are
sore
,
and
my
limbs
they
are
weary
;
*NL*
Long
is
the
way
,
and
the
mountains
are
wild
;
*NL*
Soon
will
the
twilight
close
moonless
and
dreary
*NL*
Over
the
path
of
the
poor
orphan
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
Why
did
they
send
me
so
far
and
so
lonely
,
*NL*
Up
where
the
moors
spread
and
grey
rocks
are
piled
?
*NL*
Men
are
hard-hearted
,
and
kind
angels
only
*NL*
Watch
o'er
the
steps
of
a
poor
orphan
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
distant
and
soft
the
night
breeze
is
blowing
,
*NL*
Clouds
there
are
none
,
and
clear
stars
beam
mild
,
*NL*
God
,
in
His
mercy
,
protection
is
showing
,
*NL*
Comfort
and
hope
to
the
poor
orphan
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ev
'n
should
I
fall
o'er
the
broken
bridge
passing
,
*NL*
Or
stray
in
the
marshes
,
by
false
lights
beguiled
,
*NL*
Still
will
my
Father
,
with
promise
and
blessing
,
*NL*
Take
to
His
bosom
the
poor
orphan
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
a
thought
that
for
strength
should
avail
me
,
*NL*
Though
both
of
shelter
and
kindred
despoiled
;
*NL*
Heaven
is
a
home
,
and
a
rest
will
not
fail
me
;
*NL*
God
is
a
friend
to
the
poor
orphan
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
Miss
Jane
,
do
n't
cry
,
''
said
Bessie
as
she
finished
.
She
might
as
*NL*
well
have
said
to
the
fire
,
``
do
n't
burn
!
''
but
how
could
she
divine
the
*NL*
morbid
suffering
to
which
I
was
a
prey
?
In
the
course
of
the
morning
Mr.
*NL*
Lloyd
came
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
already
up
!
''
said
he
,
as
he
entered
the
nursery
.
``
Well
,
nurse
,
*NL*
how
is
she
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bessie
answered
that
I
was
doing
very
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
she
ought
to
look
more
cheerful
.
Come
here
,
Miss
Jane
:
your
name
*NL*
is
Jane
,
is
it
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
Jane
Eyre
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
have
been
crying
,
Miss
Jane
Eyre
;
can
you
tell
me
what
about
?
*NL*
Have
you
any
pain
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
I
daresay
she
is
crying
because
she
could
not
go
out
with
Missis
in
*NL*
the
carriage
,
''
interposed
Bessie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
not
!
why
,
she
is
too
old
for
such
pettishness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
so
too
;
and
my
self-esteem
being
wounded
by
the
false
charge
,
I
*NL*
answered
promptly
,
``
I
never
cried
for
such
a
thing
in
my
life
:
I
hate
*NL*
going
out
in
the
carriage
.
I
cry
because
I
am
miserable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
fie
,
Miss
!
''
said
Bessie
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
good
apothecary
appeared
a
little
puzzled
.
I
was
standing
before
*NL*
him
;
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
me
very
steadily
:
his
eyes
were
small
and
grey
;
*NL*
not
very
bright
,
but
I
dare
say
I
should
think
them
shrewd
now
:
he
had
a
*NL*
hard-featured
yet
good-natured
looking
face
.
Having
considered
me
at
*NL*
leisure
,
he
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
made
you
ill
yesterday
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
had
a
fall
,
''
said
Bessie
,
again
putting
in
her
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fall
!
why
,
that
is
like
a
baby
again
!
Ca
n't
she
manage
to
walk
at
her
*NL*
age
?
She
must
be
eight
or
nine
years
old
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
knocked
down
,
''
was
the
blunt
explanation
,
jerked
out
of
me
by
*NL*
another
pang
of
mortified
pride
;
``
but
that
did
not
make
me
ill
,
''
I
added
;
*NL*
while
Mr.
Lloyd
helped
himself
to
a
pinch
of
snuff
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
was
returning
the
box
to
his
waistcoat
pocket
,
a
loud
bell
rang
for
*NL*
the
servants
'
dinner
;
he
knew
what
it
was
.
``
That
's
for
you
,
nurse
,
''
said
*NL*
he
;
``
you
can
go
down
;
I
'll
give
Miss
Jane
a
lecture
till
you
come
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bessie
would
rather
have
stayed
,
but
she
was
obliged
to
go
,
because
*NL*
punctuality
at
meals
was
rigidly
enforced
at
Gateshead
Hall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
fall
did
not
make
you
ill
;
what
did
,
then
?
''
pursued
Mr.
Lloyd
when
*NL*
Bessie
was
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
shut
up
in
a
room
where
there
is
a
ghost
till
after
dark
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
saw
Mr.
Lloyd
smile
and
frown
at
the
same
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ghost
!
What
,
you
are
a
baby
after
all
!
You
are
afraid
of
ghosts
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
Mr.
Reed
's
ghost
I
am
:
he
died
in
that
room
,
and
was
laid
out
there
.
*NL*
Neither
Bessie
nor
any
one
else
will
go
into
it
at
night
,
if
they
can
*NL*
help
it
;
and
it
was
cruel
to
shut
me
up
alone
without
a
candle
,
--
so
cruel
*NL*
that
I
think
I
shall
never
forget
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
!
And
is
it
that
makes
you
so
miserable
?
Are
you
afraid
now
in
*NL*
daylight
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
:
but
night
will
come
again
before
long
:
and
besides
,
--
I
am
*NL*
unhappy
,

very
unhappy
,
for
other
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
other
things
?
Can
you
tell
me
some
of
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
How
much
I
wished
to
reply
fully
to
this
question
!
How
difficult
it
was
*NL*
to
frame
any
answer
!
Children
can
feel
,
but
they
can
not
analyse
their
*NL*
feelings
;
and
if
the
analysis
is
partially
effected
in
thought
,
they
know
*NL*
not
how
to
express
the
result
of
the
process
in
words
.
Fearful
,
however
,
*NL*
of
losing
this
first
and
only
opportunity
of
relieving
my
grief
by
*NL*
imparting
it
,
I
,
after
a
disturbed
pause
,
contrived
to
frame
a
meagre
,
*NL*
though
,
as
far
as
it
went
,
true
response
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
one
thing
,
I
have
no
father
or
mother
,
brothers
or
sisters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
a
kind
aunt
and
cousins
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
I
paused
;
then
bunglingly
enounced
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
John
Reed
knocked
me
down
,
and
my
aunt
shut
me
up
in
the
red-room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Lloyd
a
second
time
produced
his
snuff-box
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
think
Gateshead
Hall
a
very
beautiful
house
?
''
asked
he
.
``
Are
*NL*
you
not
very
thankful
to
have
such
a
fine
place
to
live
at
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
my
house

sir
;
and
Abbot
says
I
have
less
right
to
be
here
*NL*
than
a
servant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pooh
!
you
ca
n't
be
silly
enough
to
wish
to
leave
such
a
splendid
place
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
had
anywhere
else
to
go
,
I
should
be
glad
to
leave
it
;
but
I
can
*NL*
never
get
away
from
Gateshead
till
I
am
a
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
you
may
--
who
knows
?
Have
you
any
relations
besides
Mrs.
Reed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
not
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
None
belonging
to
your
father
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
I
asked
Aunt
Reed
once
,
and
she
said
possibly
I
might
*NL*
have
some
poor
,
low
relations
called
Eyre
,
but
she
knew
nothing
about
*NL*
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
had
such
,
would
you
like
to
go
to
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
reflected
.
Poverty
looks
grim
to
grown
people
;
still
more
so
to
*NL*
children
:
they
have
not
much
idea
of
industrious
,
working
,
respectable
*NL*
poverty
;
they
think
of
the
word
only
as
connected
with
ragged
clothes
,
*NL*
scanty
food
,
fireless
grates
,
rude
manners
,
and
debasing
vices
:
poverty
*NL*
for
me
was
synonymous
with
degradation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
should
not
like
to
belong
to
poor
people
,
''
was
my
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
even
if
they
were
kind
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
shook
my
head
:
I
could
not
see
how
poor
people
had
the
means
of
being
*NL*
kind
;
and
then
to
learn
to
speak
like
them
,
to
adopt
their
manners
,
to
be
*NL*
uneducated
,
to
grow
up
like
one
of
the
poor
women
I
saw
sometimes
nursing
*NL*
their
children
or
washing
their
clothes
at
the
cottage
doors
of
the
*NL*
village
of
Gateshead
:
no
,
I
was
not
heroic
enough
to
purchase
liberty
at
*NL*
the
price
of
caste
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
are
your
relatives
so
very
poor
?
Are
they
working
people
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
tell
;
Aunt
Reed
says
if
I
have
any
,
they
must
be
a
beggarly
*NL*
set
:
I
should
not
like
to
go
a
begging
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
like
to
go
to
school
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
I
reflected
:
I
scarcely
knew
what
school
was
:
Bessie
sometimes
*NL*
spoke
of
it
as
a
place
where
young
ladies
sat
in
the
stocks
,
wore
*NL*
backboards
,
and
were
expected
to
be
exceedingly
genteel
and
precise
:
John
*NL*
Reed
hated
his
school
,
and
abused
his
master
;
but
John
Reed
's
tastes
were
*NL*
no
rule
for
mine
,
and
if
Bessie
's
accounts
of
school-discipline
-LRB-
gathered
*NL*
from
the
young
ladies
of
a
family
where
she
had
lived
before
coming
to
*NL*
Gateshead
-RRB-
were
somewhat
appalling
,
her
details
of
certain
*NL*
accomplishments
attained
by
these
same
young
ladies
were
,
I
thought
,
*NL*
equally
attractive
.
She
boasted
of
beautiful
paintings
of
landscapes
and
*NL*
flowers
by
them
executed
;
of
songs
they
could
sing
and
pieces
they
could
*NL*
play
,
of
purses
they
could
net
,
of
French
books
they
could
translate
;
*NL*
till
my
spirit
was
moved
to
emulation
as
I
listened
.
Besides
,
school
*NL*
would
be
a
complete
change
:
it
implied
a
long
journey
,
an
entire
*NL*
separation
from
Gateshead
,
an
entrance
into
a
new
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
indeed
like
to
go
to
school
,
''
was
the
audible
conclusion
of
my
*NL*
musings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
!
who
knows
what
may
happen
?
''
said
Mr.
Lloyd
,
as
he
got
up
.
*NL*
``
The
child
ought
to
have
change
of
air
and
scene
,
''
he
added
,
speaking
to
*NL*
himself
;
``
nerves
not
in
a
good
state
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bessie
now
returned
;
at
the
same
moment
the
carriage
was
heard
rolling
up
*NL*
the
gravel-walk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
your
mistress
,
nurse
?
''
asked
Mr.
Lloyd
.
``
I
should
like
to
speak
*NL*
to
her
before
I
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bessie
invited
him
to
walk
into
the
breakfast-room
,
and
led
the
way
out
.
*NL*
In
the
interview
which
followed
between
him
and
Mrs.
Reed
,
I
presume
,
*NL*
from
after-occurrences
,
that
the
apothecary
ventured
to
recommend
my
*NL*
being
sent
to
school
;
and
the
recommendation
was
no
doubt
readily
enough
*NL*
adopted
;
for
as
Abbot
said
,
in
discussing
the
subject
with
Bessie
when
*NL*
both
sat
sewing
in
the
nursery
one
night
,
after
I
was
in
bed
,
and
,
as
*NL*
they
thought
,
asleep
,
``
Missis
was
,
she
dared
say
,
glad
enough
to
get
rid
*NL*
of
such
a
tiresome
,
ill-conditioned
child
,
who
always
looked
as
if
she
*NL*
were
watching
everybody
,
and
scheming
plots
underhand
.
''
Abbot
,
I
think
,
*NL*
gave
me
credit
for
being
a
sort
of
infantine
Guy
Fawkes
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
that
same
occasion
I
learned
,
for
the
first
time
,
from
Miss
Abbot
's
*NL*
communications
to
Bessie
,
that
my
father
had
been
a
poor
clergyman
;
that
*NL*
my
mother
had
married
him
against
the
wishes
of
her
friends
,
who
*NL*
considered
the
match
beneath
her
;
that
my
grandfather
Reed
was
so
*NL*
irritated
at
her
disobedience
,
he
cut
her
off
without
a
shilling
;
that
*NL*
after
my
mother
and
father
had
been
married
a
year
,
the
latter
caught
the
*NL*
typhus
fever
while
visiting
among
the
poor
of
a
large
manufacturing
town
*NL*
where
his
curacy
was
situated
,
and
where
that
disease
was
then
prevalent
:
*NL*
that
my
mother
took
the
infection
from
him
,
and
both
died
within
a
month
*NL*
of
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bessie
,
when
she
heard
this
narrative
,
sighed
and
said
,
``
Poor
Miss
Jane
*NL*
is
to
be
pitied
,
too
,
Abbot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
responded
Abbot
;
``
if
she
were
a
nice
,
pretty
child
,
one
might
*NL*
compassionate
her
forlornness
;
but
one
really
can
not
care
for
such
a
*NL*
little
toad
as
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
great
deal
,
to
be
sure
,
''
agreed
Bessie
:
``
at
any
rate
,
a
beauty
*NL*
like
Miss
Georgiana
would
be
more
moving
in
the
same
condition
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
doat
on
Miss
Georgiana
!
''
cried
the
fervent
Abbot
.
``
Little
*NL*
darling
!
--
with
her
long
curls
and
her
blue
eyes
,
and
such
a
sweet
colour
*NL*
as
she
has
;
just
as
if
she
were
painted
!
--
Bessie
,
I
could
fancy
a
Welsh
*NL*
rabbit
for
supper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
could
I
--
with
a
roast
onion
.
Come
,
we
'll
go
down
.

They
went

CHAPTER
IV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
From
my
discourse
with
Mr.
Lloyd
,
and
from
the
above
reported
conference
*NL*
between
Bessie
and
Abbot
,
I
gathered
enough
of
hope
to
suffice
as
a
*NL*
motive
for
wishing
to
get
well
:
a
change
seemed
near
,
--
I
desired
and
*NL*
waited
it
in
silence
.
It
tarried
,
however
:
days
and
weeks
passed
:
I
had
*NL*
regained
my
normal
state
of
health
,
but
no
new
allusion
was
made
to
the
*NL*
subject
over
which
I
brooded
.
Mrs.
Reed
surveyed
me
at
times
with
a
*NL*
severe
eye
,
but
seldom
addressed
me
:
since
my
illness
,
she
had
drawn
a
*NL*
more
marked
line
of
separation
than
ever
between
me
and
her
own
children
;
*NL*
appointing
me
a
small
closet
to
sleep
in
by
myself
,
condemning
me
to
take
*NL*
my
meals
alone
,
and
pass
all
my
time
in
the
nursery
,
while
my
cousins
*NL*
were
constantly
in
the
drawing-room
.
Not
a
hint
,
however
,
did
she
drop
*NL*
about
sending
me
to
school
:
still
I
felt
an
instinctive
certainty
that
*NL*
she
would
not
long
endure
me
under
the
same
roof
with
her
;
for
her
*NL*
glance
,
now
more
than
ever
,
when
turned
on
me
,
expressed
an
insuperable
*NL*
and
rooted
aversion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eliza
and
Georgiana
,
evidently
acting
according
to
orders
,
spoke
to
me
as
*NL*
little
as
possible
:
John
thrust
his
tongue
in
his
cheek
whenever
he
saw
*NL*
me
,
and
once
attempted
chastisement
;
but
as
I
instantly
turned
against
*NL*
him
,
roused
by
the
same
sentiment
of
deep
ire
and
desperate
revolt
which
*NL*
had
stirred
my
corruption
before
,
he
thought
it
better
to
desist
,
and
ran
*NL*
from
me
tittering
execrations
,
and
vowing
I
had
burst
his
nose
.
I
had
*NL*
indeed
levelled
at
that
prominent
feature
as
hard
a
blow
as
my
knuckles
*NL*
could
inflict
;
and
when
I
saw
that
either
that
or
my
look
daunted
him
,
I
*NL*
had
the
greatest
inclination
to
follow
up
my
advantage
to
purpose
;
but
he
*NL*
was
already
with
his
mama
.
I
heard
him
in
a
blubbering
tone
commence
the
*NL*
tale
of
how
``
that
nasty
Jane
Eyre
''
had
flown
at
him
like
a
mad
cat
:
he
*NL*
was
stopped
rather
harshly
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
talk
to
me
about
her
,
John
:
I
told
you
not
to
go
near
her
;
she
is
*NL*
not
worthy
of
notice
;
I
do
not
choose
that
either
you
or
your
sisters
*NL*
should
associate
with
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
,
leaning
over
the
banister
,
I
cried
out
suddenly
,
and
without
at
all
*NL*
deliberating
on
my
words
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
not
fit
to
associate
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Reed
was
rather
a
stout
woman
;
but
,
on
hearing
this
strange
and
*NL*
audacious
declaration
,
she
ran
nimbly
up
the
stair
,
swept
me
like
a
*NL*
whirlwind
into
the
nursery
,
and
crushing
me
down
on
the
edge
of
my
crib
,
*NL*
dared
me
in
an
emphatic
voice
to
rise
from
that
place
,
or
utter
one
*NL*
syllable
during
the
remainder
of
the
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
would
Uncle
Reed
say
to
you
,
if
he
were
alive
?
''
was
my
scarcely
*NL*
voluntary
demand
.
I
say
scarcely
voluntary
,
for
it
seemed
as
if
my
*NL*
tongue
pronounced
words
without
my
will
consenting
to
their
utterance
:
*NL*
something
spoke
out
of
me
over
which
I
had
no
control
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
said
Mrs.
Reed
under
her
breath
:
her
usually
cold
composed
grey
*NL*
eye
became
troubled
with
a
look
like
fear
;
she
took
her
hand
from
my
arm
,
*NL*
and
gazed
at
me
as
if
she
really
did
not
know
whether
I
were
child
or
*NL*
fiend
.
I
was
now
in
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
Uncle
Reed
is
in
heaven
,
and
can
see
all
you
do
and
think
;
and
so
can
*NL*
papa
and
mama
:
they
know
how
you
shut
me
up
all
day
long
,
and
how
you
*NL*
wish
me
dead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Reed
soon
rallied
her
spirits
:
she
shook
me
most
soundly
,
she
boxed
*NL*
both
my
ears
,
and
then
left
me
without
a
word
.
Bessie
supplied
the
*NL*
hiatus
by
a
homily
of
an
hour
's
length
,
in
which
she
proved
beyond
a
*NL*
doubt
that
I
was
the
most
wicked
and
abandoned
child
ever
reared
under
a
*NL*
roof
.
I
half
believed
her
;
for
I
felt
indeed
only
bad
feelings
surging
*NL*
in
my
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
November
,
December
,
and
half
of
January
passed
away
.
Christmas
and
the
*NL*
New
Year
had
been
celebrated
at
Gateshead
with
the
usual
festive
cheer
;
*NL*
presents
had
been
interchanged
,
dinners
and
evening
parties
given
.
From
*NL*
every
enjoyment
I
was
,
of
course
,
excluded
:
my
share
of
the
gaiety
*NL*
consisted
in
witnessing
the
daily
apparelling
of
Eliza
and
Georgiana
,
and
*NL*
seeing
them
descend
to
the
drawing-room
,
dressed
out
in
thin
muslin
*NL*
frocks
and
scarlet
sashes
,
with
hair
elaborately
ringletted
;
and
*NL*
afterwards
,
in
listening
to
the
sound
of
the
piano
or
the
harp
played
*NL*
below
,
to
the
passing
to
and
fro
of
the
butler
and
footman
,
to
the
*NL*
jingling
of
glass
and
china
as
refreshments
were
handed
,
to
the
broken
*NL*
hum
of
conversation
as
the
drawing-room
door
opened
and
closed
.
When
*NL*
tired
of
this
occupation
,
I
would
retire
from
the
stairhead
to
the
*NL*
solitary
and
silent
nursery
:
there
,
though
somewhat
sad
,
I
was
not
*NL*
miserable
.
To
speak
truth
,
I
had
not
the
least
wish
to
go
into
company
,
*NL*
for
in
company
I
was
very
rarely
noticed
;
and
if
Bessie
had
but
been
kind
*NL*
and
companionable
,
I
should
have
deemed
it
a
treat
to
spend
the
evenings
*NL*
quietly
with
her
,
instead
of
passing
them
under
the
formidable
eye
of
*NL*
Mrs.
Reed
,
in
a
room
full
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
.
But
Bessie
,
as
soon
*NL*
as
she
had
dressed
her
young
ladies
,
used
to
take
herself
off
to
the
*NL*
lively
regions
of
the
kitchen
and
housekeeper
's
room
,
generally
bearing
*NL*
the
candle
along
with
her
.
I
then
sat
with
my
doll
on
my
knee
till
the
*NL*
fire
got
low
,
glancing
round
occasionally
to
make
sure
that
nothing
worse
*NL*
than
myself
haunted
the
shadowy
room
;
and
when
the
embers
sank
to
a
dull
*NL*
red
,
I
undressed
hastily
,
tugging
at
knots
and
strings
as
I
best
might
,
*NL*
and
sought
shelter
from
cold
and
darkness
in
my
crib
.
To
this
crib
I
*NL*
always
took
my
doll
;
human
beings
must
love
something
,
and
,
in
the
dearth
*NL*
of
worthier
objects
of
affection
,
I
contrived
to
find
a
pleasure
in
*NL*
loving
and
cherishing
a
faded
graven
image
,
shabby
as
a
miniature
*NL*
scarecrow
.
It
puzzles
me
now
to
remember
with
what
absurd
sincerity
I
*NL*
doated
on
this
little
toy
,
half
fancying
it
alive
and
capable
of
*NL*
sensation
.
I
could
not
sleep
unless
it
was
folded
in
my
night-gown
;
and
*NL*
when
it
lay
there
safe
and
warm
,
I
was
comparatively
happy
,
believing
it
*NL*
to
be
happy
likewise
.
*NL*
*NL*
Long
did
the
hours
seem
while
I
waited
the
departure
of
the
company
,
and
*NL*
listened
for
the
sound
of
Bessie
's
step
on
the
stairs
:
sometimes
she
*NL*
would
come
up
in
the
interval
to
seek
her
thimble
or
her
scissors
,
or
*NL*
perhaps
to
bring
me
something
by
way
of
supper
--
a
bun
or
a
*NL*
cheese-cake
--
then
she
would
sit
on
the
bed
while
I
ate
it
,
and
when
I
had
*NL*
finished
,
she
would
tuck
the
clothes
round
me
,
and
twice
she
kissed
me
,
*NL*
and
said
,
``
Good
night
,
Miss
Jane
.
''
When
thus
gentle
,
Bessie
seemed
to
me
*NL*
the
best
,
prettiest
,
kindest
being
in
the
world
;
and
I
wished
most
*NL*
intensely
that
she
would
always
be
so
pleasant
and
amiable
,
and
never
*NL*
push
me
about
,
or
scold
,
or
task
me
unreasonably
,
as
she
was
too
often
*NL*
wont
to
do
.
Bessie
Lee
must
,
I
think
,
have
been
a
girl
of
good
natural
*NL*
capacity
,
for
she
was
smart
in
all
she
did
,
and
had
a
remarkable
knack
of
*NL*
narrative
;
so
,
at
least
,
I
judge
from
the
impression
made
on
me
by
her
*NL*
nursery
tales
.
She
was
pretty
too
,
if
my
recollections
of
her
face
and
*NL*
person
are
correct
.
I
remember
her
as
a
slim
young
woman
,
with
black
*NL*
hair
,
dark
eyes
,
very
nice
features
,
and
good
,
clear
complexion
;
but
she
*NL*
had
a
capricious
and
hasty
temper
,
and
indifferent
ideas
of
principle
or
*NL*
justice
:
still
,
such
as
she
was
,
I
preferred
her
to
any
one
else
at
*NL*
Gateshead
Hall
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
fifteenth
of
January
,
about
nine
o'clock
in
the
morning
:
*NL*
Bessie
was
gone
down
to
breakfast
;
my
cousins
had
not
yet
been
summoned
*NL*
to
their
mama
;
Eliza
was
putting
on
her
bonnet
and
warm
garden-coat
to
go
*NL*
and
feed
her
poultry
,
an
occupation
of
which
she
was
fond
:
and
not
less
*NL*
so
of
selling
the
eggs
to
the
housekeeper
and
hoarding
up
the
money
she
*NL*
thus
obtained
.
She
had
a
turn
for
traffic
,
and
a
marked
propensity
for
*NL*
saving
;
shown
not
only
in
the
vending
of
eggs
and
chickens
,
but
also
in
*NL*
driving
hard
bargains
with
the
gardener
about
flower-roots
,
seeds
,
and
*NL*
slips
of
plants
;
that
functionary
having
orders
from
Mrs.
Reed
to
buy
of
*NL*
his
young
lady
all
the
products
of
her
parterre
she
wished
to
sell
:
and
*NL*
Eliza
would
have
sold
the
hair
off
her
head
if
she
could
have
made
a
*NL*
handsome
profit
thereby
.
As
to
her
money
,
she
first
secreted
it
in
odd
*NL*
corners
,
wrapped
in
a
rag
or
an
old
curl-paper
;
but
some
of
these
hoards
*NL*
having
been
discovered
by
the
housemaid
,
Eliza
,
fearful
of
one
day
losing
*NL*
her
valued
treasure
,
consented
to
intrust
it
to
her
mother
,
at
a
usurious
*NL*
rate
of
interest
--
fifty
or
sixty
per
cent.
;
which
interest
she
exacted
*NL*
every
quarter
,
keeping
her
accounts
in
a
little
book
with
anxious
*NL*
accuracy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Georgiana
sat
on
a
high
stool
,
dressing
her
hair
at
the
glass
,
and
*NL*
interweaving
her
curls
with
artificial
flowers
and
faded
feathers
,
of
*NL*
which
she
had
found
a
store
in
a
drawer
in
the
attic
.
I
was
making
my
*NL*
bed
,
having
received
strict
orders
from
Bessie
to
get
it
arranged
before
*NL*
she
returned
-LRB-
for
Bessie
now
frequently
employed
me
as
a
sort
of
under
-
*NL*
nurserymaid
,
to
tidy
the
room
,
dust
the
chairs
,
&
c.
-RRB-
.
Having
spread
the
*NL*
quilt
and
folded
my
night-dress
,
I
went
to
the
window-seat
to
put
in
*NL*
order
some
picture-books
and
doll
's
house
furniture
scattered
there
;
an
*NL*
abrupt
command
from
Georgiana
to
let
her
playthings
alone
-LRB-
for
the
tiny
*NL*
chairs
and
mirrors
,
the
fairy
plates
and
cups
,
were
her
property
-RRB-
stopped
*NL*
my
proceedings
;
and
then
,
for
lack
of
other
occupation
,
I
fell
to
*NL*
breathing
on
the
frost-flowers
with
which
the
window
was
fretted
,
and
*NL*
thus
clearing
a
space
in
the
glass
through
which
I
might
look
out
on
the
*NL*
grounds
,
where
all
was
still
and
petrified
under
the
influence
of
a
hard
*NL*
frost
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
this
window
were
visible
the
porter
's
lodge
and
the
carriage-road
,
*NL*
and
just
as
I
had
dissolved
so
much
of
the
silver-white
foliage
veiling
*NL*
the
panes
as
left
room
to
look
out
,
I
saw
the
gates
thrown
open
and
a
*NL*
carriage
roll
through
.
I
watched
it
ascending
the
drive
with
*NL*
indifference
;
carriages
often
came
to
Gateshead
,
but
none
ever
brought
*NL*
visitors
in
whom
I
was
interested
;
it
stopped
in
front
of
the
house
,
the
*NL*
door-bell
rang
loudly
,
the
new-comer
was
admitted
.
All
this
being
*NL*
nothing
to
me
,
my
vacant
attention
soon
found
livelier
attraction
in
the
*NL*
spectacle
of
a
little
hungry
robin
,
which
came
and
chirruped
on
the
twigs
*NL*
of
the
leafless
cherry-tree
nailed
against
the
wall
near
the
casement
.
*NL*
The
remains
of
my
breakfast
of
bread
and
milk
stood
on
the
table
,
and
*NL*
having
crumbled
a
morsel
of
roll
,
I
was
tugging
at
the
sash
to
put
out
*NL*
the
crumbs
on
the
window-sill
,
when
Bessie
came
running
upstairs
into
the
*NL*
nursery
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Jane
,
take
off
your
pinafore
;
what
are
you
doing
there
?
Have
you
*NL*
washed
your
hands
and
face
this
morning
?
''
I
gave
another
tug
before
I
*NL*
answered
,
for
I
wanted
the
bird
to
be
secure
of
its
bread
:
the
sash
*NL*
yielded
;
I
scattered
the
crumbs
,
some
on
the
stone
sill
,
some
on
the
*NL*
cherry-tree
bough
,
then
,
closing
the
window
,
I
replied
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Bessie
;
I
have
only
just
finished
dusting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Troublesome
,
careless
child
!
and
what
are
you
doing
now
?
You
look
quite
*NL*
red
,
as
if
you
had
been
about
some
mischief
:
what
were
you
opening
the
*NL*
window
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
spared
the
trouble
of
answering
,
for
Bessie
seemed
in
too
great
a
*NL*
hurry
to
listen
to
explanations
;
she
hauled
me
to
the
washstand
,
*NL*
inflicted
a
merciless
,
but
happily
brief
scrub
on
my
face
and
hands
with
*NL*
soap
,
water
,
and
a
coarse
towel
;
disciplined
my
head
with
a
bristly
*NL*
brush
,
denuded
me
of
my
pinafore
,
and
then
hurrying
me
to
the
top
of
the
*NL*
stairs
,
bid
me
go
down
directly
,
as
I
was
wanted
in
the
breakfast-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
would
have
asked
who
wanted
me
:
I
would
have
demanded
if
Mrs.
Reed
was
*NL*
there
;
but
Bessie
was
already
gone
,
and
had
closed
the
nursery-door
upon
*NL*
me
.
I
slowly
descended
.
For
nearly
three
months
,
I
had
never
been
*NL*
called
to
Mrs.
Reed
's
presence
;
restricted
so
long
to
the
nursery
,
the
*NL*
breakfast
,
dining
,
and
drawing-rooms
were
become
for
me
awful
regions
,
on
*NL*
which
it
dismayed
me
to
intrude
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
now
stood
in
the
empty
hall
;
before
me
was
the
breakfast-room
door
,
and
*NL*
I
stopped
,
intimidated
and
trembling
.
What
a
miserable
little
poltroon
*NL*
had
fear
,
engendered
of
unjust
punishment
,
made
of
me
in
those
days
!
I
*NL*
feared
to
return
to
the
nursery
,
and
feared
to
go
forward
to
the
parlour
;
*NL*
ten
minutes
I
stood
in
agitated
hesitation
;
the
vehement
ringing
of
the
*NL*
breakfast-room
bell
decided
me
;
I
_
must
_
enter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
could
want
me
?
''
I
asked
inwardly
,
as
with
both
hands
I
turned
the
*NL*
stiff
door-handle
,
which
,
for
a
second
or
two
,
resisted
my
efforts
.
``
What
*NL*
should
I
see
besides
Aunt
Reed
in
the
apartment
?
--
a
man
or
a
woman
?
''
The
*NL*
handle
turned
,
the
door
unclosed
,
and
passing
through
and
curtseying
low
,
*NL*
I
looked
up
at
--
a
black
pillar
!
--
such
,
at
least
,
appeared
to
me
,
at
first
*NL*
sight
,
the
straight
,
narrow
,
sable-clad
shape
standing
erect
on
the
rug
:
*NL*
the
grim
face
at
the
top
was
like
a
carved
mask
,
placed
above
the
shaft
*NL*
by
way
of
capital
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Reed
occupied
her
usual
seat
by
the
fireside
;
she
made
a
signal
to
*NL*
me
to
approach
;
I
did
so
,
and
she
introduced
me
to
the
stony
stranger
*NL*
with
the
words
:
``
This
is
the
little
girl
respecting
whom
I
applied
to
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
_
He
_
,
for
it
was
a
man
,
turned
his
head
slowly
towards
where
I
stood
,
and
*NL*
having
examined
me
with
the
two
inquisitive-looking
grey
eyes
which
*NL*
twinkled
under
a
pair
of
bushy
brows
,
said
solemnly
,
and
in
a
bass
voice
,
*NL*
``
Her
size
is
small
:
what
is
her
age
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ten
years
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
much
?
''
was
the
doubtful
answer
;
and
he
prolonged
his
scrutiny
for
*NL*
some
minutes
.
Presently
he
addressed
me
--
``
Your
name
,
little
girl
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jane
Eyre
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
uttering
these
words
I
looked
up
:
he
seemed
to
me
a
tall
gentleman
;
*NL*
but
then
I
was
very
little
;
his
features
were
large
,
and
they
and
all
the
*NL*
lines
of
his
frame
were
equally
harsh
and
prim
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Jane
Eyre
,
and
are
you
a
good
child
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Impossible
to
reply
to
this
in
the
affirmative
:
my
little
world
held
a
*NL*
contrary
opinion
:
I
was
silent
.
Mrs.
Reed
answered
for
me
by
an
*NL*
expressive
shake
of
the
head
,
adding
soon
,
``
Perhaps
the
less
said
on
that
*NL*
subject
the
better
,
Mr.
Brocklehurst
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sorry
indeed
to
hear
it
!
she
and
I
must
have
some
talk
;
''
and
bending
*NL*
from
the
perpendicular
,
he
installed
his
person
in
the
arm-chair
opposite
*NL*
Mrs.
Reed
's
.
``
Come
here
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
stepped
across
the
rug
;
he
placed
me
square
and
straight
before
him
.
*NL*
What
a
face
he
had
,
now
that
it
was
almost
on
a
level
with
mine
!
what
a
*NL*
great
nose
!
and
what
a
mouth
!
and
what
large
prominent
teeth
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
sight
so
sad
as
that
of
a
naughty
child
,
''
he
began
,
``
especially
a
*NL*
naughty
little
girl
.
Do
you
know
where
the
wicked
go
after
death
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
go
to
hell
,
''
was
my
ready
and
orthodox
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
is
hell
?
Can
you
tell
me
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
pit
full
of
fire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
should
you
like
to
fall
into
that
pit
,
and
to
be
burning
there
for
*NL*
ever
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
must
you
do
to
avoid
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
deliberated
a
moment
;
my
answer
,
when
it
did
come
,
was
objectionable
:
*NL*
``
I
must
keep
in
good
health
,
and
not
die
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
you
keep
in

Children
younger
than
you
die
daily
.
I
*NL*
buried
a
little
child
of
five
years
old
only
a
day
or
two
since
,
--
a
good
*NL*
little
child
,
whose
soul
is
now
in
heaven
.
It
is
to
be
feared
the
same
*NL*
could
not
be
said
of
you
were
you
to
be
called
hence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Not
being
in
a
condition
to
remove
his
doubt
,
I
only
cast
my
eyes
down
on
*NL*
the
two
large
feet
planted
on
the
rug
,
and
sighed
,
wishing
myself
far
*NL*
enough
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
that
sigh
is
from
the
heart
,
and
that
you
repent
of
ever
having
*NL*
been
the
occasion
of
discomfort
to
your
excellent
benefactress
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Benefactress
!
benefactress
!
''
said
I
inwardly
:
``
they
all
call
Mrs.
Reed
*NL*
my
benefactress
;
if
so
,
a
benefactress
is
a
disagreeable
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
say
your
prayers
night
and
morning
?
''
continued
my
interrogator
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
read
your
Bible
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Sometimes

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
pleasure
?
Are
you
fond
of
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
Revelations
,
and
the
book
of
Daniel
,
and
Genesis
and
Samuel
,
and
*NL*
a
little
bit
of
Exodus
,
and
some
parts
of
Kings
and
Chronicles
,
and
Job
*NL*
and
Jonah
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
Psalms
?
I
hope
you
like
them
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
?
oh
,
shocking
!
I
have
a
little
boy
,
younger
than
you
,
who
knows
six
*NL*
Psalms
by
heart
:
and
when
you
ask
him
which
he
would
rather
have
,
a
*NL*
gingerbread-nut
to
eat
or
a
verse
of
a
Psalm
to
learn
,
he
says
:
`
Oh
!
the
*NL*
verse
of
a
Psalm
!
angels
sing
Psalms
;
'
says
he
,
'
I
wish
to
be
a
little
*NL*
angel
here
below
;
'
he
then
gets
two
nuts
in
recompense
for
his
infant
*NL*
piety
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Psalms
are
not
interesting
,
''
I
remarked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
proves
you
have
a
wicked
heart
;
and
you
must
pray
to
God
to
change
*NL*
it
:
to
give
you
a
new
and
clean
one
:
to
take
away
your
heart
of
stone
and
*NL*
give
you
a
heart
of
flesh
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
about
to
propound
a
question
,
touching
the
manner
in
which
that
*NL*
operation
of
changing
my
heart
was
to
be
performed
,
when
Mrs.
Reed
*NL*
interposed
,
telling
me
to
sit
down
;
she
then
proceeded
to
carry
on
the
*NL*
conversation
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Brocklehurst
,
I
believe
I
intimated
in
the
letter
which
I
wrote
to
*NL*
you
three
weeks
ago
,
that
this
little
girl
has
not
quite
the
character
*NL*
and
disposition
I
could
wish
:
should
you
admit
her
into
Lowood
school
,
I
*NL*
should
be
glad
if
the
superintendent
and
teachers
were
requested
to
keep
*NL*
a
strict
eye
on
her
,
and
,
above
all
,
to
guard
against
her
worst
fault
,
a
*NL*
tendency
to
deceit
.
I
mention
this
in
your
hearing
,
Jane
,
that
you
may
*NL*
not
attempt
to
impose
on
Mr.
Brocklehurst
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Well
might
I
dread
,
well
might
I
dislike
Mrs.
Reed
;
for
it
was
her
nature
*NL*
to
wound
me
cruelly
;
never
was
I
happy
in
her
presence
;
however
carefully
*NL*
I
obeyed
,
however
strenuously
I
strove
to
please
her
,
my
efforts
were
*NL*
still
repulsed
and
repaid
by
such
sentences
as
the
above
.
Now
,
uttered
*NL*
before
a
stranger
,
the
accusation
cut
me
to
the
heart
;
I
dimly
perceived
*NL*
that
she
was
already
obliterating
hope
from
the
new
phase
of
existence
*NL*
which
she
destined
me
to
enter
;
I
felt
,
though
I
could
not
have
expressed
*NL*
the
feeling
,
that
she
was
sowing
aversion
and
unkindness
along
my
future
*NL*
path
;
I
saw
myself
transformed
under
Mr.
Brocklehurst
's
eye
into
an
*NL*
artful
,
noxious
child
,
and
what
could
I
do
to
remedy
the
injury
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
indeed
,
''
thought
I
,
as
I
struggled
to
repress
a
sob
,
and
*NL*
hastily
wiped
away
some
tears
,
the
impotent
evidences
of
my
anguish
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Deceit
is
,
indeed
,
a
sad
fault
in
a
child
,
''
said
Mr.
Brocklehurst
;
``
it
*NL*
is
akin
to
falsehood
,
and
all
liars
will
have
their
portion
in
the
lake
*NL*
burning
with
fire
and
brimstone
;
she
shall
,
however
,
be
watched
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Reed
.
I
will
speak
to
Miss
Temple
and
the
teachers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
wish
her
to
be
brought
up
in
a
manner
suiting
her
prospects
,
''
*NL*
continued
my
benefactress
;
``
to
be
made
useful
,
to
be
kept
humble
:
as
for
*NL*
the
vacations
,
she
will
,
with
your
permission
,
spend
them
always
at
*NL*
Lowood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
decisions
are
perfectly
judicious
,
madam
,
''
returned
Mr.
*NL*
Brocklehurst
.
``
Humility
is
a
Christian
grace
,
and
one
peculiarly
*NL*
appropriate
to
the
pupils
of
Lowood
;
I
,
therefore
,
direct
that
especial
*NL*
care
shall
be
bestowed
on
its
cultivation
amongst
them
.
I
have
studied
*NL*
how
best
to
mortify
in
them
the
worldly
sentiment
of
pride
;
and
,
only
the
*NL*
other
day
,
I
had
a
pleasing
proof
of
my
success
.
My
second
daughter
,
*NL*
Augusta
,
went
with
her
mama
to
visit
the
school
,
and
on
her
return
she
*NL*
exclaimed
:

Oh

dear
papa
,
how
quiet
and
plain
all
the
girls
at
Lowood
*NL*
look
,
with
their
hair
combed
behind
their
ears
,
and
their
long
pinafores
,
*NL*
and
those
little
holland
pockets
outside
their
frocks
--
they
are
almost
*NL*
like
poor
people
's
children

,
'
said
she
,
`
they
looked
at
my
dress
and
*NL*
mama
's
,
as
if
they
had
never
seen
a
silk
gown
before
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
the
state
of
things
I
quite
approve
,
''
returned
Mrs.
Reed
;
``
had
I
*NL*
sought
all
England
over
,
I
could
scarcely
have
found
a
system
more
*NL*
exactly
fitting
a
child
like
Jane
Eyre

Consistency

Lowood

plain

unsophisticated

Quite

a

addicted

falsehood

''
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
words
Mr.
Brocklehurst
put
into
my
hand
a
thin
pamphlet
sewn
*NL*
in
a
cover
,
and
having
rung
for
his
carriage
,
he
departed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Reed
and
I
were
left
alone
:
some
minutes
passed
in
silence
;
she
was
*NL*
sewing
,
I
was
watching
her
.
Mrs.
Reed
might
be
at
that
time
some
six
or
*NL*
seven
and
thirty
;
she
was
a
woman
of
robust
frame
,
square-shouldered
and
*NL*
strong-limbed
,
not
tall
,
and
,
though
stout
,
not
obese
:
she
had
a
somewhat
*NL*
large
face
,
the
under
jaw
being
much
developed
and
very
solid
;
her
brow
*NL*
was
low
,
her
chin
large
and
prominent
,
mouth
and
nose
sufficiently
*NL*
regular
;
under
her
light
eyebrows
glimmered
an
eye
devoid
of
ruth
;
her
*NL*
skin
was
dark
and
opaque
,
her
hair
nearly
flaxen
;
her
constitution
was
*NL*
sound
as
a
bell
--
illness
never
came
near
her
;
she
was
an
exact
,
clever
*NL*
manager
;
her
household
and
tenantry
were
thoroughly
under
her
control
;
*NL*
her
children
only
at
times
defied
her
authority
and
laughed
it
to
scorn
;
*NL*
she
dressed
well
,
and
had
a
presence
and
port
calculated
to
set
off
*NL*
handsome
attire
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sitting
on
a
low
stool
,
a
few
yards
from
her
arm-chair
,
I
examined
her
*NL*
figure
;
I
perused
her
features
.
In
my
hand
I
held
the
tract
containing
*NL*
the
sudden
death
of
the
Liar
,
to
which
narrative
my
attention
had
been
*NL*
pointed
as
to
an
appropriate
warning
.
What
had
just
passed
;
what
Mrs.
*NL*
Reed
had
said
concerning
me
to
Mr.
Brocklehurst
;
the
whole
tenor
of
their
*NL*
conversation
,
was
recent
,
raw
,
and
stinging
in
my
mind
;
I
had
felt
every
*NL*
word
as
acutely
as
I
had
heard
it
plainly
,
and
a
passion
of
resentment
*NL*
fomented
now
within
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Reed
looked
up
from
her
work
;
her
eye
settled
on
mine
,
her
fingers
*NL*
at
the
same
time
suspended
their
nimble
movements
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
out
of
the
room
;
return
to
the
nursery
,
''
was
her
mandate
.
My
look
or
*NL*
something
else
must
have
struck
her
as
offensive
,
for
she
spoke
with
*NL*
extreme
though
suppressed
irritation
.
I
got
up
,
I
went
to
the
door
;
I
*NL*
came
back
again
;
I
walked
to
the
window
,
across
the
room
,
then
close
up
*NL*
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
Speak
_
I
must
:
I
had
been
trodden
on
severely
,
and
_
must
_
turn
:
but
how
?
*NL*
What
strength
had
I
to
dart
retaliation
at
my
antagonist
?
I
gathered
my
*NL*
energies
and
launched
them
in
this
blunt
sentence
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
deceitful
:
if
I
were
,
I
should
say
I
loved
you
;
but
I
declare
I
*NL*
do
not
love
you
:
I
dislike
you
the
worst
of
anybody
in
the
world
except
*NL*
John
Reed
;
and
this
book
about
the
liar
,
you
may
give
to
your
girl
,
*NL*
Georgiana
,
for
it
is
she
who
tells
lies
,
and
not
I.

*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Reed
's
hands
still
lay
on
her
work
inactive
:
her
eye
of
ice
*NL*
continued
to
dwell
freezingly
on
mine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
more
have
you
to
say
?
''
she
asked
,
rather
in
the
tone
in
which
a
*NL*
person
might
address
an
opponent
of
adult
age
than
such
as
is
ordinarily
*NL*
used
to
a
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
eye
of
hers
,
that
voice
stirred
every
antipathy
I
had
.
Shaking
from
*NL*
head
to
foot
,
thrilled
with
ungovernable
excitement
,
I
continued
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
you
are
no
relation
of
mine

I
will
never
call
you
aunt
again

as
long

I
live

I
will
never
come
to
see
you
when
I
am
grown
up
;
and
*NL*
if
any
one
asks
me
how
I
liked
you

and
how
you
treated
me
,
I
will
say
*NL*

very
thought

sick

you
treated

miserable
cruelty

no

I

but
I
can
not

so

you
have
no

I
shall
remember

how
you
thrust
me
back

roughly
and
violently
thrust
me
back
--
into
the
*NL*
red-room
,
and
locked
me
up
there
,
to
my
dying
day
;
though
I
was
in
agony
;

though
I
cried
out
,
while
suffocating
with
distress
,
`
Have

And
that
punishment
you
made
me
suffer

your

wicked
boy
struck
me

knocked

down
for
nothing

questions

this
exact

*NL*
Ere
I
had
finished
this
reply
,
my
soul
began
to
expand
,
to
exult
,
with
*NL*
the
strangest
sense
of
freedom
,
of
triumph
,
I
ever
felt
.
It
seemed
as
if
*NL*
an
invisible
bond
had
burst
,
and
that
I
had
struggled
out
into
unhoped
-
*NL*
for
liberty

Not
without
cause
was
this
sentiment
:
Mrs.

looked
*NL*
frightened
;
her
work
had
slipped
from
her
knee
;
she
was
lifting
up
her
*NL*
hands
,
rocking
herself
to
and
fro
,
and
even
twisting
her
face
as
if
she
*NL*
would
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jane
,
you
are
under
a
mistake
:
what
is
the
matter
with
you
?
Why
do
you
*NL*
tremble
so
violently
?
Would
you
like
to
drink
some
water
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Mrs.
Reed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
anything
else
you
wish
for
,
Jane
?
I
assure
you
,
I
desire
to
be
*NL*
your
friend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
you
.
You
told
Mr.
Brocklehurst
I
had
a
bad
character
,
a
deceitful
*NL*
disposition
;
and
I
'll
let
everybody
at
Lowood
know
what
you
are
,
and
what
*NL*
you
have
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jane
,
you
do
n't
understand
these
things
:
children
must
be
corrected
for
*NL*
their
faults
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Deceit
is
not
my
fault
!
''
I
cried
out
in
a
savage
,
high
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
are
passionate
,
Jane
,
that
you
must
allow
:
and
now
return
to
the
*NL*
nursery
--
there
's
a
dear
--
and
lie
down
a
little
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
your
dear
;
I
can
not
lie
down
:
send
me
to
school
soon
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Reed
,
for
I
hate
to
live
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
indeed
send
her
to
school
soon
,
''
murmured
Mrs.
Reed
_
sotto
voce
_
;
*NL*
and
gathering
up
her
work
,
she
abruptly
quitted
the
apartment
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
left
there
alone
--
winner
of
the
field
.
It
was
the
hardest
battle
I
*NL*
had
fought
,
and
the
first
victory
I
had
gained
:
I
stood
awhile
on
the
*NL*
rug
,
where
Mr.
Brocklehurst
had
stood
,
and
I
enjoyed
my
conqueror
's
*NL*
solitude
.
First
,
I
smiled
to
myself
and
felt
elate
;
but
this
fierce
*NL*
pleasure
subsided
in
me
as
fast
as
did
the
accelerated
throb
of
my
*NL*
pulses
.
A
child
can
not
quarrel
with
its
elders
,
as
I
had
done
;
can
not
*NL*
give
its
furious
feelings
uncontrolled
play
,
as
I
had
given
mine
,
without
*NL*
experiencing
afterwards
the
pang
of
remorse
and
the
chill
of
reaction
.
A
*NL*
ridge
of
lighted
heath
,
alive
,
glancing
,
devouring
,
would
have
been
a
*NL*
meet
emblem
of
my
mind
when
I
accused
and
menaced
Mrs.
Reed
:
the
same
*NL*
ridge
,
black
and
blasted
after
the
flames
are
dead
,
would
have
*NL*
represented
as
meetly
my
subsequent
condition
,
when
half-an-hour
's
*NL*
silence
and
reflection
had
shown
me
the
madness
of
my
conduct
,
and
the
*NL*
dreariness
of
my
hated
and
hating
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
Something
of
vengeance
I
had
tasted
for
the
first
time
;
as
aromatic
wine
*NL*
it
seemed
,
on
swallowing
,
warm
and
racy
:
its
after-flavour
,
metallic
and
*NL*
corroding
,
gave
me
a
sensation
as
if
I
had
been
poisoned
.
Willingly
*NL*
would
I
now
have
gone
and
asked
Mrs.
Reed
's
pardon
;
but
I
knew
,
partly
*NL*
from
experience
and
partly
from
instinct
,
that
was
the
way
to
make
her
*NL*
repulse
me
with
double
scorn
,
thereby
re-exciting
every
turbulent
impulse
*NL*
of
my
nature
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
would
fain
exercise
some
better
faculty
than
that
of
fierce
speaking
;
*NL*
fain
find
nourishment
for
some
less
fiendish
feeling
than
that
of
sombre
*NL*
indignation
.
I
took
a
book
--
some
Arabian
tales
;
I
sat
down
and
*NL*
endeavoured
to
read
.
I
could
make
no
sense
of
the
subject
;
my
own
*NL*
thoughts
swam
always
between
me
and
the
page
I
had
usually
found
*NL*
fascinating
.
I
opened
the
glass-door
in
the
breakfast-room
:
the
*NL*
shrubbery
was
quite
still
:
the
black
frost
reigned
,
unbroken
by
sun
or
*NL*
breeze
,
through
the
grounds
.
I
covered
my
head
and
arms
with
the
skirt
*NL*
of
my
frock
,
and
went
out
to
walk
in
a
part
of
the
plantation
which
was
*NL*
quite
sequestrated
;
but
I
found
no
pleasure
in
the
silent
trees
,
the
*NL*
falling
fir-cones
,
the
congealed
relics
of
autumn
,
russet
leaves
,
swept
*NL*
by
past
winds
in
heaps
,
and
now
stiffened
together
.
I
leaned
against
a
*NL*
gate
,
and
looked
into
an
empty
field
where
no
sheep
were
feeding
,
where
*NL*
the
short
grass
was
nipped
and
blanched
.
It
was
a
very
grey
day
;
a
most
*NL*
opaque
sky
,
``
onding
on
snaw
,
''
canopied
all
;
thence
flakes
felt
it
*NL*
intervals
,
which
settled
on
the
hard
path
and
on
the
hoary
lea
without
*NL*
melting
.
I
stood
,
a
wretched
child
enough
,
whispering
to
myself
over
and
*NL*
over
again
,
``
What
shall
I
do
?
--
what
shall
I
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
I
heard
a
clear
voice
call
,
``
Miss
Jane
!
where
are
you
?
Come
*NL*
to
lunch
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Bessie
,
I
knew
well
enough
;
but
I
did
not
stir
;
her
light
step
*NL*
came
tripping
down
the
path
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
naughty
little
thing
!
''
she
said
.
``
Why
do
n't
you
come
when
you
are
*NL*
called
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bessie
's
presence
,
compared
with
the
thoughts
over
which
I
had
been
*NL*
brooding
,
seemed
cheerful
;
even
though
,
as
usual
,
she
was
somewhat
cross
.
*NL*
The
fact
is
,
after
my
conflict
with
and
victory
over
Mrs.
Reed
,
I
was
not
*NL*
disposed
to
care
much
for
the
nursemaid
's
transitory
anger
;
and
I
_
was
_
*NL*
disposed
to
bask
in
her
youthful
lightness
of
heart
.
I
just
put
my
two
*NL*
arms
round
her
and
said
,
``
Come
,
Bessie
!
do
n't
scold
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
action
was
more
frank
and
fearless
than
any
I
was
habituated
to
*NL*
indulge
in
:
somehow
it
pleased
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
strange
child
,
Miss
Jane
,
''
she
said
,
as
she
looked
down
at
me
;
*NL*
``
a
little
roving
,
solitary
thing
:
and
you
are
going
to
school
,
I
*NL*
suppose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
nodded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
wo
n't
you
be
sorry
to
leave
poor
Bessie
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
Bessie
care
for
me
?
She
is
always
scolding
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
you
're
such
a
queer
,
frightened
,
shy
little
thing
.
You
should
*NL*
be
bolder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
to
get
more
knocks
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
!
But
you
are
rather
put
upon
,
that
's
certain
.
My
mother
said
,
*NL*
when
she
came
to
see
me
last
week
,
that
she
would
not
like
a
little
one
*NL*
of
her
own
to
be
in
your
place
.
--
Now
,
come
in
,
and
I
've
some
good
news
*NL*
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
you
have
,
Bessie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Child
!
what
do
you
mean
?
What
sorrowful
eyes
you
fix
on
me
!
Well
,
but
*NL*
Missis
and
the
young
ladies
and
Master
John
are
going
out
to
tea
this
*NL*
afternoon
,
and
you
shall
have
tea
with
me
.
I
'll
ask
cook
to
bake
you
a
*NL*
little
cake
,
and
then
you
shall
help
me
to
look
over
your
drawers
;
for
I
*NL*
am
soon
to
pack
your
trunk
.
Missis
intends
you
to
leave
Gateshead
in
a
*NL*
day
or
two
,
and
you
shall
choose
what
toys
you
like
to
take
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bessie
,
you
must
promise
not
to
scold
me
any
more
till
I
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
will
;
but
mind
you
are
a
very
good
girl
,
and
do
n't
be
afraid
of
*NL*
me
.
Do
n't
start
when
I
chance
to
speak
rather
sharply
;
it
's
so
*NL*
provoking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
I
shall
ever
be
afraid
of
you
again
,
Bessie
,
because
I
*NL*
have
got
used
to
you
,
and
I
shall
soon
have
another
set
of
people
to
*NL*
dread
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
dread
them
they
'll
dislike
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you
do
,
Bessie
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
dislike
you

am
fonder

others

You
do

show
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
little
sharp
thing

quite
a

talking

makes
you
so
venturesome
and
hardy
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
shall
soon
be
away
from
you
,
and
besides
''
--
I
was
going
to
say
*NL*
something
about
what
had
passed
between
me
and
Mrs.
Reed
,
but
on
second
*NL*
thoughts
I
considered
it
better
to
remain
silent
on
that
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
you
're
glad
to
leave
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
,
Bessie

indeed
,
just
now
I
'm
rather
sorry

*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
now
!
and
rather
!
How
coolly
my
little
lady
says
it
!
I
dare
say
*NL*
now
if
I
were
to
ask
you
for
a
kiss
you
would
n't
give
it
me
:
you
'd
say
*NL*
you

_
rather
_
not

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
kiss
you
and
welcome
:
bend
your
head
down
.
''
Bessie
stooped
;
we
*NL*
mutually
embraced
,
and
I
followed
her
into
the
house
quite
comforted
.
*NL*
That
afternoon
lapsed
in
peace
and
harmony
;
and
in
the
evening
Bessie
*NL*
told
me
some
of
her
most
enchanting
stories
,
and
sang
me
some
of
her
*NL*
sweetest
songs
.
Even
for
me
life
had
its
gleams
of
sunshine

CHAPTER
V
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Five
o'clock
had
hardly
struck
on
the
morning
of
the
19th
of
January
,
*NL*
when
Bessie
brought
a
candle
into
my
closet
and
found
me
already
up
and
*NL*
nearly
dressed
.
I
had
risen
half-an-hour
before
her
entrance
,
and
had
*NL*
washed
my
face
,
and
put
on
my
clothes
by
the
light
of
a
half-moon
just
*NL*
setting
,
whose
rays
streamed
through
the
narrow
window
near
my
crib
.
I
*NL*
was
to
leave
Gateshead
that
day
by
a
coach
which
passed
the
lodge
gates
*NL*
at
six
a.m.
Bessie
was
the
only
person
yet
risen
;
she
had
lit
a
fire
in
*NL*
the
nursery
,
where
she
now
proceeded
to
make
my
breakfast
.
Few
children
*NL*
can
eat
when
excited
with
the
thoughts
of
a
journey
;
nor
could
I.
Bessie
,
*NL*
having
pressed
me
in
vain
to
take
a
few
spoonfuls
of
the
boiled
milk
and
*NL*
bread
she
had
prepared
for
me
,
wrapped
up
some
biscuits
in
a
paper
and
*NL*
put
them
into
my
bag
;
then
she
helped
me
on
with
my
pelisse
and
bonnet
,
*NL*
and
wrapping
herself
in
a
shawl
,
she
and
I
left
the
nursery
.
As
we
*NL*
passed
Mrs.
Reed
's
bedroom
,
she
said
,
``
Will
you
go
in
and
bid
Missis
good
-
*NL*
bye
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Bessie
:
she
came
to
my
crib
last
night
when
you
were
gone
down
to
*NL*
supper
,
and
said
I
need
not
disturb
her
in
the
morning
,
or
my
cousins
*NL*
either
;
and
she
told
me
to
remember
that
she
had
always
been
my
best
*NL*
friend
,
and
to
speak
of
her
and
be
grateful
to
her
accordingly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
you
say
,
Miss
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
:
I
covered
my
face
with
the
bedclothes
,
and
turned
from
her
to
*NL*
the
wall
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
wrong
,
Miss
Jane
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
quite
right
,
Bessie
.
Your
Missis
has
not
been
my
friend
:
she
has
*NL*
been
my
foe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
Miss
Jane
!
do
n't
say
so
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
to
Gateshead
!
''
cried
I
,
as
we
passed
through
the
hall
and
went
*NL*
out
at
the
front
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
moon
was
set
,
and
it
was
very
dark
;
Bessie
carried
a
lantern
,
whose
*NL*
light
glanced
on
wet
steps
and
gravel
road
sodden
by
a
recent
thaw
.
Raw
*NL*
and
chill
was
the
winter
morning
:
my
teeth
chattered
as
I
hastened
down
*NL*
the
drive
.
There
was
a
light
in
the
porter
's
lodge
:
when
we
reached
it
,
*NL*
we
found
the
porter
's
wife
just
kindling
her
fire
:
my
trunk
,
which
had
*NL*
been
carried
down
the
evening
before
,
stood
corded
at
the
door
.
It
*NL*
wanted
but
a
few
minutes
of
six
,
and
shortly
after
that
hour
had
struck
,
*NL*
the
distant
roll
of
wheels
announced
the
coming
coach
;
I
went
to
the
door
*NL*
and
watched
its
lamps
approach
rapidly
through
the
gloom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
she
going
by
herself
?
''
asked
the
porter
's
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
far
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fifty
miles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
long
way
!
I
wonder
Mrs.
Reed
is
not
afraid
to
trust
her
so
far
*NL*
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
coach
drew
up
;
there
it
was
at
the
gates
with
its
four
horses
and
its
*NL*
top
laden
with
passengers
:
the
guard
and
coachman
loudly
urged
haste
;
my
*NL*
trunk
was
hoisted
up
;
I
was
taken
from
Bessie
's
neck
,
to
which
I
clung
*NL*
with
kisses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
sure
and
take
good
care
of
her
,
''
cried
she
to
the
guard
,
as
he
lifted
*NL*
me
into
the
inside
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
ay
!
''
was
the
answer
:
the
door
was
slapped
to
,
a
voice
exclaimed
``
All
*NL*
right
,
''
and
on
we
drove
.
Thus
was
I
severed
from
Bessie
and
Gateshead
;
*NL*
thus
whirled
away
to
unknown
,
and
,
as
I
then
deemed
,
remote
and
*NL*
mysterious
regions
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
remember
but
little
of
the
journey
;
I
only
know
that
the
day
seemed
to
*NL*
me
of
a
preternatural
length
,
and
that
we
appeared
to
travel
over
*NL*
hundreds
of
miles
of
road
.
We
passed
through
several
towns
,
and
in
one
,
*NL*
a
very
large
one
,
the
coach
stopped
;
the
horses
were
taken
out
,
and
the
*NL*
passengers
alighted
to
dine
.
I
was
carried
into
an
inn
,
where
the
guard
*NL*
wanted
me
to
have
some
dinner
;
but
,
as
I
had
no
appetite
,
he
left
me
in
*NL*
an
immense
room
with
a
fireplace
at
each
end
,
a
chandelier
pendent
from
*NL*
the
ceiling
,
and
a
little
red
gallery
high
up
against
the
wall
filled
*NL*
with
musical
instruments
.
Here
I
walked
about
for
a
long
time
,
feeling
*NL*
very
strange
,
and
mortally
apprehensive
of
some
one
coming
in
and
*NL*
kidnapping
me
;
for
I
believed
in
kidnappers
,
their
exploits
having
*NL*
frequently
figured
in
Bessie
's
fireside
chronicles
.
At
last
the
guard
*NL*
returned
;
once
more
I
was
stowed
away
in
the
coach
,
my
protector
mounted
*NL*
his
own
seat
,
sounded
his
hollow
horn
,
and
away
we
rattled
over
the
*NL*
``
stony
street
''
of
L
-
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
afternoon
came
on
wet
and
somewhat
misty
:
as
it
waned
into
dusk
,
I
*NL*
began
to
feel
that
we
were
getting
very
far
indeed
from
Gateshead
:
we
*NL*
ceased
to
pass
through
towns
;
the
country
changed
;
great
grey
hills
*NL*
heaved
up
round
the
horizon
:
as
twilight
deepened
,
we
descended
a
valley
,
*NL*
dark
with
wood
,
and
long
after
night
had
overclouded
the
prospect
,
I
*NL*
heard
a
wild
wind
rushing
amongst
trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lulled
by
the
sound
,
I
at
last
dropped
asleep
;
I
had
not
long
slumbered
*NL*
when
the
sudden
cessation
of
motion
awoke
me
;
the
coach-door
was
open
,
*NL*
and
a
person
like
a
servant
was
standing
at
it
:
I
saw
her
face
and
dress
*NL*
by
the
light
of
the
lamps
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
a
little
girl
called
Jane
Eyre
here
?
''
she
asked
.
I
answered
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
and
was
then
lifted
out
;
my
trunk
was
handed
down
,
and
the
coach
*NL*
instantly
drove
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
stiff
with
long
sitting
,
and
bewildered
with
the
noise
and
motion
*NL*
of
the
coach
:
Gathering
my
faculties
,
I
looked
about
me
.
Rain
,
wind
,
and
*NL*
darkness
filled
the
air
;
nevertheless
,
I
dimly
discerned
a
wall
before
me
*NL*
and
a
door
open
in
it
;
through
this
door
I
passed
with
my
new
guide
:
she
*NL*
shut
and
locked
it
behind
her
.
There
was
now
visible
a
house
or
*NL*
houses
--
for
the
building
spread
far
--
with
many
windows
,
and
lights
*NL*
burning
in
some
;
we
went
up
a
broad
pebbly
path
,
splashing
wet
,
and
were
*NL*
admitted
at
a
door
;
then
the
servant
led
me
through
a
passage
into
a
room
*NL*
with
a
fire
,
where
she
left
me
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
stood
and
warmed
my
numbed
fingers
over
the
blaze
,
then
I
looked
round
;
*NL*
there
was
no
candle
,
but
the
uncertain
light
from
the
hearth
showed
,
by
*NL*
intervals
,
papered
walls
,
carpet
,
curtains
,
shining
mahogany
furniture
:
*NL*
it
was
a
parlour
,
not
so
spacious
or
splendid
as
the
drawing-room
at
*NL*
Gateshead
,
but
comfortable
enough
.
I
was
puzzling
to
make
out
the
*NL*
subject
of
a
picture
on
the
wall
,
when
the
door
opened
,
and
an
individual
*NL*
carrying
a
light
entered
;
another
followed
close
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
was
a
tall
lady
with
dark
hair
,
dark
eyes
,
and
a
pale
and
large
*NL*
forehead
;
her
figure
was
partly
enveloped
in
a
shawl
,
her
countenance
was
*NL*
grave
,
her
bearing
erect
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
child
is
very
young
to
be
sent
alone
,
''
said
she
,
putting
her
candle
*NL*
down
on
the
table
.
She
considered
me
attentively
for
a
minute
or
two
,
*NL*
then
further
added
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
had
better
be
put
to
bed
soon
;
she
looks
tired
:
are
you
tired
?
''
she
*NL*
asked
,
placing
her
hand
on
my
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
little
,
ma'am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
hungry
too
,
no
doubt
:
let
her
have
some
supper
before
she
goes
to
*NL*
bed
,
Miss
Miller
.
Is
this
the
first
time
you
have
left
your
parents
to
*NL*
come
to
school
,
my
little
girl
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
explained
to
her
that
I
had
no
parents
.
She
inquired
how
long
they
had
*NL*
been
dead
:
then
how
old
I
was
,
what
was
my
name
,
whether
I
could
read
,
*NL*
write
,
and
sew
a
little
:
then
she
touched
my
cheek
gently
with
her
*NL*
forefinger
,
and
saying
,
``
She
hoped
I
should
be
a
good
child
,
''
dismissed
*NL*
me
along
with
Miss
Miller
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lady
I
had
left
might
be
about
twenty-nine
;
the
one
who
went
with
me
*NL*
appeared
some
years
younger
:
the
first
impressed
me
by
her
voice
,
look
,
*NL*
and
air
.
Miss
Miller
was
more
ordinary
;
ruddy
in
complexion
,
though
of
a
*NL*
careworn
countenance
;
hurried
in
gait
and
action
,
like
one
who
had
always
*NL*
a
multiplicity
of
tasks
on
hand
:
she
looked
,
indeed
,
what
I
afterwards
*NL*
found
she
really
was
,
an
under-teacher
.
Led
by
her
,
I
passed
from
*NL*
compartment
to
compartment
,
from
passage
to
passage
,
of
a
large
and
*NL*
irregular
building
;
till
,
emerging
from
the
total
and
somewhat
dreary
*NL*
silence
pervading
that
portion
of
the
house
we
had
traversed
,
we
came
*NL*
upon
the
hum
of
many
voices
,
and
presently
entered
a
wide
,
long
room
,
*NL*
with
great
deal
tables
,
two
at
each
end
,
on
each
of
which
burnt
a
pair
of
*NL*
candles
,
and
seated
all
round
on
benches
,
a
congregation
of
girls
of
*NL*
every
age
,
from
nine
or
ten
to
twenty
.
Seen
by
the
dim
light
of
the
*NL*
dips
,
their
number
to
me
appeared
countless
,
though
not
in
reality
*NL*
exceeding
eighty
;
they
were
uniformly
dressed
in
brown
stuff
frocks
of
*NL*
quaint
fashion
,
and
long
holland
pinafores
.
It
was
the
hour
of
study
;
*NL*
they
were
engaged
in
conning
over
their
to-morrow
's
task
,
and
the
hum
I
*NL*
had
heard
was
the
combined
result
of
their
whispered
repetitions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Miller
signed
to
me
to
sit
on
a
bench
near
the
door
,
then
walking
up
*NL*
to
the
top
of
the
long
room
she
cried
out
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monitors
,
collect
the
lesson-books
and
put
them
away
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Four
tall
girls
arose
from
different
tables
,
and
going
round
,
gathered
*NL*
the
books
and
removed
them
.
Miss
Miller
again
gave
the
word
of
command
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monitors
,
fetch
the
supper-trays
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
tall
girls
went
out
and
returned
presently
,
each
bearing
a
tray
,
with
*NL*
portions
of
something
,
I
knew
not
what
,
arranged
thereon
,
and
a
pitcher
*NL*
of
water
and
mug
in
the
middle
of
each
tray
.
The
portions
were
handed
*NL*
round
;
those
who
liked
took
a
draught
of
the
water
,
the
mug
being
common
*NL*
to
all
.
When
it
came
to
my
turn
,
I
drank
,
for
I
was
thirsty
,
but
did
not
*NL*
touch
the
food
,
excitement
and
fatigue
rendering
me
incapable
of
eating
:
*NL*
I
now
saw
,
however
,
that
it
was
a
thin
oaten
cake
shared
into
fragments
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
meal
over
,
prayers
were
read
by
Miss
Miller
,
and
the
classes
filed
*NL*
off
,
two
and
two
,
upstairs
.
Overpowered
by
this
time
with
weariness
,
I
*NL*
scarcely
noticed
what
sort
of
a
place
the
bedroom
was
,
except
that
,
like
*NL*
the
schoolroom
,
I
saw
it
was
very
long
.
To-night
I
was
to
be
Miss
*NL*
Miller
's
bed-fellow
;
she
helped
me
to
undress
:
when
laid
down
I
glanced
*NL*
at
the
long
rows
of
beds
,
each
of
which
was
quickly
filled
with
two
*NL*
occupants
;
in
ten
minutes
the
single
light
was
extinguished
,
and
amidst
*NL*
silence
and
complete
darkness
I
fell
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
night
passed
rapidly
.
I
was
too
tired
even
to
dream
;
I
only
once
*NL*
awoke
to
hear
the
wind
rave
in
furious
gusts
,
and
the
rain
fall
in
*NL*
torrents
,
and
to
be
sensible
that
Miss
Miller
had
taken
her
place
by
my
*NL*
side
.
When
I
again
unclosed
my
eyes
,
a
loud
bell
was
ringing
;
the
girls
*NL*
were
up
and
dressing
;
day
had
not
yet
begun
to
dawn
,
and
a
rushlight
or
*NL*
two
burned
in
the
room
.
I
too
rose
reluctantly
;
it
was
bitter
cold
,
and
*NL*
I
dressed
as
well
as
I
could
for
shivering
,
and
washed
when
there
was
a
*NL*
basin
at
liberty
,
which
did
not
occur
soon
,
as
there
was
but
one
basin
to
*NL*
six
girls
,
on
the
stands
down
the
middle
of
the
room
.
Again
the
bell
*NL*
rang
:
all
formed
in
file
,
two
and
two
,
and
in
that
order
descended
the
*NL*
stairs
and
entered
the
cold
and
dimly
lit
schoolroom
:
here
prayers
were
*NL*
read
by
Miss
Miller
;
afterwards
she
called
out
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Form
classes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
great
tumult
succeeded
for
some
minutes
,
during
which
Miss
Miller
*NL*
repeatedly
exclaimed
,
``
Silence
!
''
and
``
Order
!
''
When
it
subsided
,
I
saw
*NL*
them
all
drawn
up
in
four
semicircles
,
before
four
chairs
,
placed
at
the
*NL*
four
tables
;
all
held
books
in
their
hands
,
and
a
great
book
,
like
a
*NL*
Bible
,
lay
on
each
table
,
before
the
vacant
seat
.
A
pause
of
some
*NL*
seconds
succeeded
,
filled
up
by
the
low
,
vague
hum
of
numbers
;
Miss
*NL*
Miller
walked
from
class
to
class
,
hushing
this
indefinite
sound
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
distant
bell
tinkled
:
immediately
three
ladies
entered
the
room
,
each
*NL*
walked
to
a
table
and
took
her
seat
.
Miss
Miller
assumed
the
fourth
*NL*
vacant
chair
,
which
was
that
nearest
the
door
,
and
around
which
the
*NL*
smallest
of
the
children
were
assembled
:
to
this
inferior
class
I
was
*NL*
called
,
and
placed
at
the
bottom
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Business
now
began
,
the
day
's
Collect
was
repeated
,
then
certain
texts
of
*NL*
Scripture
were
said
,
and
to
these
succeeded
a
protracted
reading
of
*NL*
chapters
in
the
Bible
,
which
lasted
an
hour
.
By
the
time
that
exercise
*NL*
was
terminated
,
day
had
fully
dawned
.
The
indefatigable
bell
now
sounded
*NL*
for
the
fourth
time
:
the
classes
were
marshalled
and
marched
into
another
*NL*
room
to
breakfast
:
how
glad
I
was
to
behold
a
prospect
of
getting
*NL*
something
to
eat
!
I
was
now
nearly
sick
from
inanition
,
having
taken
so
*NL*
little
the
day
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
refectory
was
a
great
,
low-ceiled
,
gloomy
room
;
on
two
long
tables
*NL*
smoked
basins
of
something
hot
,
which
,
however
,
to
my
dismay
,
sent
forth
*NL*
an
odour
far
from
inviting
.
I
saw
a
universal
manifestation
of
*NL*
discontent
when
the
fumes
of
the
repast
met
the
nostrils
of
those
*NL*
destined
to
swallow
it
;
from
the
van
of
the
procession
,
the
tall
girls
of
*NL*
the
first
class
,
rose
the
whispered
words
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Disgusting
!
The
porridge
is
burnt
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Silence
!
''
ejaculated
a
voice
;
not
that
of
Miss
Miller
,
but
one
of
the
*NL*
upper
teachers
,
a
little
and
dark
personage
,
smartly
dressed
,
but
of
*NL*
somewhat
morose
aspect
,
who
installed
herself
at
the
top
of
one
table
,
*NL*
while
a
more
buxom
lady
presided
at
the
other
.
I
looked
in
vain
for
her
*NL*
I
had
first
seen
the
night
before
;
she
was
not
visible
:
Miss
Miller
*NL*
occupied
the
foot
of
the
table
where
I
sat
,
and
a
strange
,
*NL*
foreign-looking
,
elderly
lady
,
the
French
teacher
,
as
I
afterwards
found
,
*NL*
took
the
corresponding
seat
at
the
other
board
.
A
long
grace
was
said
*NL*
and
a
hymn
sung
;
then
a
servant
brought
in
some
tea
for
the
teachers
,
and
*NL*
the
meal
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ravenous
,
and
now
very
faint
,
I
devoured
a
spoonful
or
two
of
my
portion
*NL*
without
thinking
of
its
taste
;
but
the
first
edge
of
hunger
blunted
,
I
*NL*
perceived
I
had
got
in
hand
a
nauseous
mess
;
burnt
porridge
is
almost
as
*NL*
bad
as
rotten
potatoes
;
famine
itself
soon
sickens
over
it
.
The
spoons
*NL*
were
moved
slowly
:
I
saw
each
girl
taste
her
food
and
try
to
swallow
it
;
*NL*
but
in
most
cases
the
effort
was
soon
relinquished
.
Breakfast
was
over
,
*NL*
and
none
had
breakfasted
.
Thanks
being
returned
for
what
we
had
not
got
,
*NL*
and
a
second
hymn
chanted
,
the
refectory
was
evacuated
for
the
*NL*
schoolroom
.
I
was
one
of
the
last
to
go
out
,
and
in
passing
the
tables
,
*NL*
I
saw
one
teacher
take
a
basin
of
the
porridge
and
taste
it
;
she
looked
*NL*
at
the
others
;
all
their
countenances
expressed
displeasure
,
and
one
of
*NL*
them
,
the
stout
one
,
whispered
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Abominable
stuff
!
How
shameful
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
quarter
of
an
hour
passed
before
lessons
again
began
,
during
which
the
*NL*
schoolroom
was
in
a
glorious
tumult
;
for
that
space
of
time
it
seemed
to
*NL*
be
permitted
to
talk
loud
and
more
freely
,
and
they
used
their
privilege
.
*NL*
The
whole
conversation
ran
on
the
breakfast
,
which
one
and
all
abused
*NL*
roundly
.
Poor
things
!
it
was
the
sole
consolation
they
had
.
Miss
Miller
*NL*
was
now
the
only
teacher
in
the
room
:
a
group
of
great
girls
standing
*NL*
about
her
spoke
with
serious
and
sullen
gestures
.
I
heard
the
name
of
*NL*
Mr.
Brocklehurst
pronounced
by
some
lips
;
at
which
Miss
Miller
shook
her
*NL*
head
disapprovingly
;
but
she
made
no
great
effort
to
check
the
general
*NL*
wrath
;
doubtless
she
shared
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
clock
in
the
schoolroom
struck
nine
;
Miss
Miller
left
her
circle
,
and
*NL*
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
cried
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Silence
!
To
your
seats
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Discipline
prevailed
:
in
five
minutes
the
confused
throng
was
resolved
*NL*
into
order
,
and
comparative
silence
quelled
the
Babel
clamour
of
tongues
.
*NL*
The
upper
teachers
now
punctually
resumed
their
posts
:
but
still
,
all
*NL*
seemed
to
wait
.
Ranged
on
benches
down
the
sides
of
the
room
,
the
eighty
*NL*
girls
sat
motionless
and
erect
;
a
quaint
assemblage
they
appeared
,
all
*NL*
with
plain
locks
combed
from
their
faces
,
not
a
curl
visible
;
in
brown
*NL*
dresses
,
made
high
and
surrounded
by
a
narrow
tucker
about
the
throat
,
*NL*
with
little
pockets
of
holland
-LRB-
shaped
something
like
a
Highlander
's
*NL*
purse
-RRB-
tied
in
front
of
their
frocks
,
and
destined
to
serve
the
purpose
*NL*
of
a
work-bag
:
all
,
too
,
wearing
woollen
stockings
and
country-made
*NL*
shoes
,
fastened
with
brass
buckles
.
Above
twenty
of
those
clad
in
this
*NL*
costume
were
full-grown
girls
,
or
rather
young
women
;
it
suited
them
ill
,
*NL*
and
gave
an
air
of
oddity
even
to
the
prettiest
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
still
looking
at
them
,
and
also
at
intervals
examining
the
*NL*
teachers
--
none
of
whom
precisely
pleased
me
;
for
the
stout
one
was
a
*NL*
little
coarse
,
the
dark
one
not
a
little
fierce
,
the
foreigner
harsh
and
*NL*
grotesque
,
and
Miss
Miller
,
poor
thing
!
looked
purple
,
weather-beaten
,
*NL*
and
over-worked
--
when
,
as
my
eye
wandered
from
face
to
face
,
the
whole
*NL*
school
rose
simultaneously
,
as
if
moved
by
a
common
spring
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
the
matter
?
I
had
heard
no
order
given
:
I
was
puzzled
.
Ere
I
*NL*
had
gathered
my
wits
,
the
classes
were
again
seated
:
but
as
all
eyes
were
*NL*
now
turned
to
one
point
,
mine
followed
the
general
direction
,
and
*NL*
encountered
the
personage
who
had
received
me
last
night
.
She
stood
at
*NL*
the
bottom
of
the
long
room
,
on
the
hearth
;
for
there
was
a
fire
at
each
*NL*
end
;
she
surveyed
the
two
rows
of
girls
silently
and
gravely
.
Miss
*NL*
Miller
approaching
,
seemed
to
ask
her
a
question
,
and
having
received
her
*NL*
answer
,
went
back
to
her
place
,
and
said
aloud
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monitor
of
the
first
class
,
fetch
the
globes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
direction
was
being
executed
,
the
lady
consulted
moved
slowly
*NL*
up
the
room
.
I
suppose
I
have
a
considerable
organ
of
veneration
,
for
I
*NL*
retain
yet
the
sense
of
admiring
awe
with
which
my
eyes
traced
her
steps
.
*NL*
Seen
now
,
in
broad
daylight
,
she
looked
tall
,
fair
,
and
shapely
;
brown
*NL*
eyes
with
a
benignant
light
in
their
irids
,
and
a
fine
pencilling
of
long
*NL*
lashes
round
,
relieved
the
whiteness
of
her
large
front
;
on
each
of
her
*NL*
temples
her
hair
,
of
a
very
dark
brown
,
was
clustered
in
round
curls
,
*NL*
according
to
the
fashion
of
those
times
,
when
neither
smooth
bands
nor
*NL*
long
ringlets
were
in
vogue
;
her
dress
,
also
in
the
mode
of
the
day
,
was
*NL*
of
purple
cloth
,
relieved
by
a
sort
of
Spanish
trimming
of
black
velvet
;
*NL*
a
gold
watch
-LRB-
watches
were
not
so
common
then
as
now
-RRB-
shone
at
her
*NL*
girdle
.
Let
the
reader
add
,
to
complete
the
picture
,
refined
features
;
a
*NL*
complexion
,
if
pale
,
clear
;
and
a
stately
air
and
carriage
,
and
he
will
*NL*
have
,
at
least
,
as
clearly
as
words
can
give
it
,
a
correct
idea
of
the
*NL*
exterior
of
Miss
Temple
--
Maria
Temple
,
as
I
afterwards
saw
the
name
*NL*
written
in
a
prayer-book
intrusted
to
me
to
carry
to
church
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
superintendent
of
Lowood
-LRB-
for
such
was
this
lady
-RRB-
having
taken
her
*NL*
seat
before
a
pair
of
globes
placed
on
one
of
the
tables
,
summoned
the
*NL*
first
class
round
her
,
and
commenced
giving
a
lesson
on
geography
;
the
*NL*
lower
classes
were
called
by
the
teachers
:
repetitions
in
history
,
*NL*
grammar
,
&
c.
,
went
on
for
an
hour
;
writing
and
arithmetic
succeeded
,
and
*NL*
music
lessons
were
given
by
Miss
Temple
to
some
of
the
elder
girls
.
The
*NL*
duration
of
each
lesson
was
measured
by
the
clock
,
which
at
last
struck
*NL*
twelve
.
The
superintendent
rose
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
a
word
to
address
to
the
pupils
,
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tumult
of
cessation
from
lessons
was
already
breaking
forth
,
but
it
*NL*
sank
at
her
voice
.
She
went
on
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
this
morning
a
breakfast
which
you
could
not
eat
;
you
must
be
*NL*
hungry
:
--
I
have
ordered
that
a
lunch
of
bread
and
cheese
shall
be
served
*NL*
to
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
teachers
looked
at
her
with
a
sort
of
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
to
be
done
on
my
responsibility
,
''
she
added
,
in
an
explanatory
*NL*
tone
to
them
,
and
immediately
afterwards
left
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bread
and
cheese
was
presently
brought
in
and
distributed
,
to
the
*NL*
high
delight
and
refreshment
of
the
whole
school
.
The
order
was
now
*NL*
given
``
To
the
garden
!
''
Each
put
on
a
coarse
straw
bonnet
,
with
strings
*NL*
of
coloured
calico
,
and
a
cloak
of
grey
frieze
.
I
was
similarly
*NL*
equipped
,
and
,
following
the
stream
,
I
made
my
way
into
the
open
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
garden
was
a
wide
inclosure
,
surrounded
with
walls
so
high
as
to
*NL*
exclude
every
glimpse
of
prospect
;
a
covered
verandah
ran
down
one
side
,
*NL*
and
broad
walks
bordered
a
middle
space
divided
into
scores
of
little
*NL*
beds
:
these
beds
were
assigned
as
gardens
for
the
pupils
to
cultivate
,
*NL*
and
each
bed
had
an
owner
.
When
full
of
flowers
they
would
doubtless
*NL*
look
pretty
;
but
now
,
at
the
latter
end
of
January
,
all
was
wintry
blight
*NL*
and
brown
decay
.
I
shuddered
as
I
stood
and
looked
round
me
:
it
was
an
*NL*
inclement
day
for
outdoor
exercise
;
not
positively
rainy
,
but
darkened
by
*NL*
a
drizzling
yellow
fog
;
all
under
foot
was
still
soaking
wet
with
the
*NL*
floods
of
yesterday
.
The
stronger
among
the
girls
ran
about
and
engaged
*NL*
in
active
games
,
but
sundry
pale
and
thin
ones
herded
together
for
*NL*
shelter
and
warmth
in
the
verandah
;
and
amongst
these
,
as
the
dense
mist
*NL*
penetrated
to
their
shivering
frames
,
I
heard
frequently
the
sound
of
a
*NL*
hollow
cough
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
yet
I
had
spoken
to
no
one
,
nor
did
anybody
seem
to
take
notice
of
me
;
*NL*
I
stood
lonely
enough
:
but
to
that
feeling
of
isolation
I
was
accustomed
;
*NL*
it
did
not
oppress
me
much
.
I
leant
against
a
pillar
of
the
verandah
,
*NL*
drew
my
grey
mantle
close
about
me
,
and
,
trying
to
forget
the
cold
which
*NL*
nipped
me
without
,
and
the
unsatisfied
hunger
which
gnawed
me
within
,
*NL*
delivered
myself
up
to
the
employment
of
watching
and
thinking
.
My
*NL*
reflections
were
too
undefined
and
fragmentary
to
merit
record
:
I
hardly
*NL*
yet
knew
where
I
was
;
Gateshead
and
my
past
life
seemed
floated
away
to
*NL*
an
immeasurable
distance
;
the
present
was
vague
and
strange
,
and
of
the
*NL*
future
I
could
form
no
conjecture
.
I
looked
round
the
convent-like
*NL*
garden
,
and
then
up
at
the
house
--
a
large
building
,
half
of
which
seemed
*NL*
grey
and
old
,
the
other
half
quite
new
.
The
new
part
,
containing
the
*NL*
schoolroom
and
dormitory
,
was
lit
by
mullioned
and
latticed
windows
,
*NL*
which
gave
it
a
church-like
aspect
;
a
stone
tablet
over
the
door
bore
*NL*
this
inscription
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lowood
Institution
.
--
This
portion
was
rebuilt
A.D.
--
,
by
Naomi
*NL*
Brocklehurst
,
of
Brocklehurst
Hall
,
in
this
county
.
''
``
Let
your
light
so
*NL*
shine
before
men
,
that
they
may
see
your
good
works
,
and
glorify
your
*NL*
Father
which
is
in
heaven
.
''
--
St.
Matt
.
v.
16
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
read
these
words
over
and
over
again
:
I
felt
that
an
explanation
*NL*
belonged
to
them
,
and
was
unable
fully
to
penetrate
their
import
.
I
was
*NL*
still
pondering
the
signification
of
``
Institution
,
''
and
endeavouring
to
*NL*
make
out
a
connection
between
the
first
words
and
the
verse
of
Scripture
,
*NL*
when
the
sound
of
a
cough
close
behind
me
made
me
turn
my
head
.
I
saw
a
*NL*
girl
sitting
on
a
stone
bench
near
;
she
was
bent
over
a
book
,
on
the
*NL*
perusal
of
which
she
seemed
intent
:
from
where
I
stood
I
could
see
the
*NL*
title
--
it
was
``
Rasselas
;
''
a
name
that
struck
me
as
strange
,
and
*NL*
consequently
attractive
.
In
turning
a
leaf
she
happened
to
look
up
,
and
*NL*
I
said
to
her
directly
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
your
book
interesting
?
''
I
had
already
formed
the
intention
of
asking
*NL*
her
to
lend
it
to
me
some
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
it
,
''
she
answered
,
after
a
pause
of
a
second
or
two
,
during
which
*NL*
she
examined
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
about
?
''
I
continued
.
I
hardly
know
where
I
found
the
*NL*
hardihood
thus
to
open
a
conversation
with
a
stranger
;
the
step
was
*NL*
contrary
to
my
nature
and
habits
:
but
I
think
her
occupation
touched
a
*NL*
chord
of
sympathy
somewhere
;
for
I
too
liked
reading
,
though
of
a
*NL*
frivolous
and
childish
kind
;
I
could
not
digest
or
comprehend
the
serious
*NL*
or
substantial
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
look
at
it
,
''
replied
the
girl
,
offering
me
the
book
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
so
;
a
brief
examination
convinced
me
that
the
contents
were
less
*NL*
taking
than
the
title
:
``
Rasselas
''
looked
dull
to
my
trifling
taste
;
I
saw
*NL*
nothing
about
fairies
,
nothing
about
genii
;
no
bright
variety
seemed
*NL*
spread
over
the
closely-printed
pages
.
I
returned
it
to
her
;
she
*NL*
received
it
quietly
,
and
without
saying
anything
she
was
about
to
relapse
*NL*
into
her
former
studious
mood
:
again
I
ventured
to
disturb
her
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
tell
me
what
the
writing
on
that
stone
over
the
door
means
?
What
*NL*
is
Lowood
Institution
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
house

you

live

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
do
they
call
it

Is
it
in
any
way
different
from
*NL*
other

*NL*
*NL*
``

partly
a

*NL*
*NL*
``
Both

*NL*
*NL*
``

has
a
pocket-handkerchief
tied
to
her
side
with
a
*NL*
yellow
ribband

Madame
Pierrot

she
comes
from
Lisle
,
in
France
,
and
*NL*
teaches
French
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
like
the
teachers
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
enough

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
like
the
little
black
one

and
the
Madame

can
not
*NL*
pronounce
her
name
as
you
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Scatcherd
is
hasty
--
you
must
take
care
not
to
offend
her

Madame
*NL*
Pierrot
is
not
a
bad
sort
of
person

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
Miss
Temple
is
the
best
--
is
n't
she
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Temple
is
very
good
and
very
clever
;
she
is
above
the
rest
,
because
*NL*
she
knows
far
more
than
they
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
been
long
here
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Two

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ask
rather
too
many
questions
.
I
have
given
you
answers
enough
for
*NL*
the
present
:
now
I
want
to
read
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
that
moment
the
summons
sounded
for
dinner
;
all
re-entered
the
*NL*
house
.
The
odour
which
now
filled
the
refectory
was
scarcely
more
*NL*
appetising
than
that
which
had
regaled
our
nostrils
at
breakfast
:
the
*NL*
dinner
was
served
in
two
huge
tin-plated
vessels
,
whence
rose
a
strong
*NL*
steam
redolent
of
rancid
fat
.
I
found
the
mess
to
consist
of
indifferent
*NL*
potatoes
and
strange
shreds
of
rusty
meat
,
mixed
and
cooked
together
.
Of
*NL*
this
preparation
a
tolerably
abundant
plateful
was
apportioned
to
each
*NL*
pupil
.
I
ate
what
I
could
,
and
wondered
within
myself
whether
every
*NL*
day
's
fare
would
be
like
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
dinner
,
we
immediately
adjourned
to
the
schoolroom
:
lessons
*NL*
recommenced
,
and
were
continued
till
five
o'clock
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
only
marked
event
of
the
afternoon
was
,
that
I
saw
the
girl
with
whom
*NL*
I
had
conversed
in
the
verandah
dismissed
in
disgrace
by
Miss
Scatcherd
*NL*
from
a
history
class
,
and
sent
to
stand
in
the
middle
of
the
large
*NL*
schoolroom
.
The
punishment
seemed
to
me
in
a
high
degree
ignominious
,
*NL*
especially
for
so
great
a
girl
--
she
looked
thirteen
or
upwards
.
I
*NL*
expected
she
would
show
signs
of
great
distress
and
shame
;
but
to
my
*NL*
surprise
she
neither
wept
nor
blushed
:
composed
,
though
grave
,
she
stood
,
*NL*
the
central
mark
of
all
eyes
.
``
How
can
she
bear
it
so
quietly
--
so
*NL*
firmly
?
''
I
asked
of
myself
.
``
Were
I
in
her
place
,
it
seems
to
me
I
*NL*
should
wish
the
earth
to
open
and
swallow
me
up
.
She
looks
as
if
she
*NL*
were
thinking
of
something
beyond
her
punishment
--
beyond
her
situation
:
*NL*
of
something
not
round
her
nor
before
her
.
I
have
heard
of
day-dreams
--
is
*NL*
she
in
a
day-dream
now
?
Her
eyes
are
fixed
on
the
floor
,
but
I
am
sure
*NL*
they
do
not
see
it
--
her
sight
seems
turned
in
,
gone
down
into
her
heart
:
*NL*
she
is
looking
at
what
she
can
remember
,
I
believe
;
not
at
what
is
really
*NL*
present
.
I
wonder
what
sort
of
a
girl
she
is
--
whether
good
or
naughty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
after
five
p.m.
we
had
another
meal
,
consisting
of
a
small
mug
of
*NL*
coffee
,
and
half-a-slice
of
brown
bread
.
I
devoured
my
bread
and
drank
*NL*
my
coffee
with
relish
;
but
I
should
have
been
glad
of
as
much
more
--
I
was
*NL*
still
hungry
.
Half-an-hour
's
recreation
succeeded
,
then
study
;
then
the
*NL*
glass
of
water
and
the
piece
of
oat-cake
,
prayers
,
and
bed
.
Such
was
my
*NL*
first
day
at
Lowood
.

CHAPTER
VI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
commenced
as
before
,
getting
up
and
dressing
by
rushlight
;
*NL*
but
this
morning
we
were
obliged
to
dispense
with
the
ceremony
of
*NL*
washing
;
the
water
in
the
pitchers
was
frozen
.
A
change
had
taken
place
*NL*
in
the
weather
the
preceding
evening
,
and
a
keen
north-east
wind
,
*NL*
whistling
through
the
crevices
of
our
bedroom
windows
all
night
long
,
had
*NL*
made
us
shiver
in
our
beds
,
and
turned
the
contents
of
the
ewers
to
ice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
the
long
hour
and
a
half
of
prayers
and
Bible-reading
was
over
,
I
*NL*
felt
ready
to
perish
with
cold
.
Breakfast-time
came
at
last
,
and
this
*NL*
morning
the
porridge
was
not
burnt
;
the
quality
was
eatable
,
the
quantity
*NL*
small
.
How
small
my
portion
seemed
!
I
wished
it
had
been
doubled
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
course
of
the
day
I
was
enrolled
a
member
of
the
fourth
class
,
and
*NL*
regular
tasks
and
occupations
were
assigned
me
:
hitherto
,
I
had
only
been
*NL*
a
spectator
of
the
proceedings
at
Lowood
;
I
was
now
to
become
an
actor
*NL*
therein
.
At
first
,
being
little
accustomed
to
learn
by
heart
,
the
*NL*
lessons
appeared
to
me
both
long
and
difficult
;
the
frequent
change
from
*NL*
task
to
task
,
too
,
bewildered
me
;
and
I
was
glad
when
,
about
three
*NL*
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
Miss
Smith
put
into
my
hands
a
border
of
muslin
*NL*
two
yards
long
,
together
with
needle
,
thimble
,
&
c.
,
and
sent
me
to
sit
in
*NL*
a
quiet
corner
of
the
schoolroom
,
with
directions
to
hem
the
same
.
At
*NL*
that
hour
most
of
the
others
were
sewing
likewise
;
but
one
class
still
*NL*
stood
round
Miss
Scatcherd
's
chair
reading
,
and
as
all
was
quiet
,
the
*NL*
subject
of
their
lessons
could
be
heard
,
together
with
the
manner
in
*NL*
which
each
girl
acquitted
herself
,
and
the
animadversions
or
*NL*
commendations
of
Miss
Scatcherd
on
the
performance
.
It
was
English
*NL*
history
:
among
the
readers
I
observed
my
acquaintance
of
the
verandah
:
at
*NL*
the
commencement
of
the
lesson
,
her
place
had
been
at
the
top
of
the
*NL*
class
,
but
for
some
error
of
pronunciation
,
or
some
inattention
to
stops
,
*NL*
she
was
suddenly
sent
to
the
very
bottom
.
Even
in
that
obscure
position
,
*NL*
Miss
Scatcherd
continued
to
make
her
an
object
of
constant
notice
:
she
*NL*
was
continually
addressing
to
her
such
phrases
as
the
following
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Burns
''
-LRB-
such
it
seems
was
her
name
:
the
girls
here
were
all
called
by
*NL*
their
surnames
,
as
boys
are
elsewhere
-RRB-
,
``
Burns
,
you
are
standing
on
the
*NL*
side
of
your
shoe
;
turn
your
toes
out
immediately
.
''
``
Burns
,
you
poke
*NL*
your
chin
most
unpleasantly
;
draw
it
in
.
''
``
Burns
,
I
insist
on
your
*NL*
holding
your
head
up
;
I
will
not
have
you
before
me
in
that
attitude
,
''
*NL*
&
c.
&
c
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
chapter
having
been
read
through
twice
,
the
books
were
closed
and
the
*NL*
girls
examined
.
The
lesson
had
comprised
part
of
the
reign
of
Charles
*NL*
I.
,
and
there
were
sundry
questions
about
tonnage
and
poundage
and
ship
-
*NL*
money
,
which
most
of
them
appeared
unable
to
answer
;
still
,
every
little
*NL*
difficulty
was
solved
instantly
when
it
reached
Burns
:
her
memory
seemed
*NL*
to
have
retained
the
substance
of
the
whole
lesson
,
and
she
was
ready
*NL*
with
answers
on
every
point
.
I
kept
expecting
that
Miss
Scatcherd
would
*NL*
praise
her
attention
;
but
,
instead
of
that
,
she
suddenly
cried
out
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
dirty
,
disagreeable
girl
!
you
have
never
cleaned
your
nails
this
*NL*
morning
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Burns
made
no
answer
:
I
wondered
at
her
silence
.
``
Why
,
''
thought
I
,
``
does
*NL*
she
not
explain
that
she
could
neither
clean
her
nails
nor
wash
her
face
,
*NL*
as
the
water
was
frozen
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
attention
was
now
called
off
by
Miss
Smith
desiring
me
to
hold
a
skein
*NL*
of
thread
:
while
she
was
winding
it
,
she
talked
to
me
from
time
to
time
,
*NL*
asking
whether
I
had
ever
been
at
school
before
,
whether
I
could
mark
,
*NL*
stitch
,
knit
,
&
c.
;
till
she
dismissed
me
,
I
could
not
pursue
my
*NL*
observations
on
Miss
Scatcherd
's
movements
.
When
I
returned
to
my
seat
,
*NL*
that
lady
was
just
delivering
an
order
of
which
I
did
not
catch
the
*NL*
import
;
but
Burns
immediately
left
the
class
,
and
going
into
the
small
*NL*
inner
room
where
the
books
were
kept
,
returned
in
half
a
minute
,
carrying
*NL*
in
her
hand
a
bundle
of
twigs
tied
together
at
one
end
.
This
ominous
*NL*
tool
she
presented
to
Miss
Scatcherd
with
a
respectful
curtesy
;
then
she
*NL*
quietly
,
and
without
being
told
,
unloosed
her
pinafore
,
and
the
teacher
*NL*
instantly
and
sharply
inflicted
on
her
neck
a
dozen
strokes
with
the
*NL*
bunch
of
twigs
.
Not
a
tear
rose
to
Burns
'
eye
;
and
,
while
I
paused
from
*NL*
my
sewing
,
because
my
fingers
quivered
at
this
spectacle
with
a
sentiment
*NL*
of
unavailing
and
impotent
anger
,
not
a
feature
of
her
pensive
face
*NL*
altered
its
ordinary
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hardened
girl
!
''
exclaimed
Miss
Scatcherd
;
``
nothing
can
correct
you
of
*NL*
your
slatternly
habits
:
carry
the
rod
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Burns
obeyed
:
I
looked
at
her
narrowly
as
she
emerged
from
the
*NL*
book-closet
;
she
was
just
putting
back
her
handkerchief
into
her
pocket
,
*NL*
and
the
trace
of
a
tear
glistened
on
her
thin
cheek
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
play-hour
in
the
evening
I
thought
the
pleasantest
fraction
of
the
*NL*
day
at
Lowood
:
the
bit
of
bread
,
the
draught
of
coffee
swallowed
at
five
*NL*
o'clock
had
revived
vitality
,
if
it
had
not
satisfied
hunger
:
the
long
*NL*
restraint
of
the
day
was
slackened
;
the
schoolroom
felt
warmer
than
in
*NL*
the
morning
--
its
fires
being
allowed
to
burn
a
little
more
brightly
,
to
*NL*
supply
,
in
some
measure
,
the
place
of
candles
,
not
yet
introduced
:
the
*NL*
ruddy
gloaming
,
the
licensed
uproar
,
the
confusion
of
many
voices
gave
*NL*
one
a
welcome
sense
of
liberty
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
evening
of
the
day
on
which
I
had
seen
Miss
Scatcherd
flog
her
*NL*
pupil
,
Burns
,
I
wandered
as
usual
among
the
forms
and
tables
and
laughing
*NL*
groups
without
a
companion
,
yet
not
feeling
lonely
:
when
I
passed
the
*NL*
windows
,
I
now
and
then
lifted
a
blind
,
and
looked
out
;
it
snowed
fast
,
a
*NL*
drift
was
already
forming
against
the
lower
panes
;
putting
my
ear
close
*NL*
to
the
window
,
I
could
distinguish
from
the
gleeful
tumult
within
,
the
*NL*
disconsolate
moan
of
the
wind
outside
.
*NL*
*NL*
Probably
,
if
I
had
lately
left
a
good
home
and
kind
parents
,
this
would
*NL*
have
been
the
hour
when
I
should
most
keenly
have
regretted
the
*NL*
separation
;
that
wind
would
then
have
saddened
my
heart
;
this
obscure
*NL*
chaos
would
have
disturbed
my
peace
!
as
it
was
,
I
derived
from
both
a
*NL*
strange
excitement
,
and
reckless
and
feverish
,
I
wished
the
wind
to
howl
*NL*
more
wildly
,
the
gloom
to
deepen
to
darkness
,
and
the
confusion
to
rise
*NL*
to
clamour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jumping
over
forms
,
and
creeping
under
tables
,
I
made
my
way
to
one
of
*NL*
the
fire-places
;
there
,
kneeling
by
the
high
wire
fender
,
I
found
Burns
,
*NL*
absorbed
,
silent
,
abstracted
from
all
round
her
by
the
companionship
of
a
*NL*
book
,
which
she
read
by
the
dim
glare
of
the
embers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
still
`
Rasselas
'
?
''
I
asked
,
coming
behind
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
said
,
``
and
I
have
just
finished
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
in
five
minutes
more
she
shut
it
up
.
I
was
glad
of
this
.
``
Now
,
''
*NL*
thought
I
,
``
I
can
perhaps
get
her
to
talk
.
''
I
sat
down
by
her
on
the
*NL*
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
your
name
besides
Burns
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Helen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
come
a
long
way
from
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
come
from
a
place
farther
north
,
quite
on
the
borders
of
Scotland
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
ever
go
back
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
so
;
but
nobody
can
be
sure
of
the
future
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
wish
to
leave
Lowood
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
why
should
I
?
I
was
sent
to
Lowood
to
get
an
education
;
and
it
*NL*
would
be
of
no
use
going
away
until
I
have
attained
that
object
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
that
teacher
,
Miss
Scatcherd
,
is
so
cruel
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cruel
?
Not
at
all
!
She
is
severe
:
she
dislikes
my
faults
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
if
I
were
in
your
place
I
should
dislike
her
;
I
should
resist
her
.
*NL*
If
she
struck
me
with
that
rod
,
I
should
get
it
from
her
hand
;
I
should
*NL*
break
it
under
her
nose

*NL*
*NL*
``
Probably
you
would
do
nothing
of
the
sort
:
but
if
you
did
,
Mr.
*NL*
Brocklehurst
would
expel
you
from
the
school
;
that
would
be
a
great
grief
*NL*
to
your
relations
.
It
is
far
better
to
endure
patiently
a
smart
which
*NL*
nobody
feels
but
yourself
,
than
to
commit
a
hasty
action
whose
evil
*NL*
consequences
will
extend
to
all
connected

you

and
besides
,
the
*NL*
Bible
bids
us
return
good
for
evil
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
then
it
seems
disgraceful
to
be
flogged
,
and
to
be
sent
to
stand
in
*NL*
the
middle
of
a
room
full
of
people
;
and
you
are
such
a
great
girl
:
I
am
*NL*
far
younger
than
you

I
could
not
bear
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
it
would
be
your
duty
to
bear
it
,
if
you
could
not
avoid
it
:
it
is
*NL*
weak
and
silly
to
say
you
_

not

what
it
is
your
fate
to
be
*NL*
required
to
bear

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
heard
her
with
wonder
:
I
could
not
comprehend
this
doctrine
of
*NL*
endurance
;
and
still
less
could
I
understand
or
sympathise
with
the
*NL*
forbearance
she
expressed
for
her
chastiser
.
Still
I
felt
that
Helen
*NL*
Burns
considered
things
by
a
light
invisible
to
my
eyes
.
I
suspected
she
*NL*
might
be
right
and
I
wrong
;
but
I
would
not
ponder
the
matter
deeply
;
*NL*
like
Felix
,
I
put
it
off
to
a
more
convenient
season
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
say
you
have
faults
,
Helen
:
what
are
they
?
To
me
you
seem
very
*NL*
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
learn
from
me
,
not
to
judge
by
appearances
:
I
am
,
as
Miss
Scatcherd
*NL*
said
,
slatternly
;
I
seldom
put
,
and
never
keep
,
things
,
in
order
;
I
am
*NL*
careless
;
I
forget
rules
;
I
read
when
I
should
learn
my
lessons
;
I
have
*NL*
no
method
;
and
sometimes
I
say
,
like
you
,
I
can
not
_
bear
_
to
be
subjected
*NL*
to
systematic
arrangements
.
This
is
all
very
provoking
to
Miss
*NL*
Scatcherd
,
who
is
naturally
neat
,
punctual
,
and
particular
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
cross
and
cruel
,
''
I
added
;
but
Helen
Burns
would
not
admit
my
*NL*
addition
:
she
kept
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Miss
Temple
as
severe
to
you
as
Miss
Scatcherd
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
utterance
of
Miss
Temple
's
name
,
a
soft
smile
flitted
over
her
*NL*
grave
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Temple
is
full
of
goodness
;
it
pains
her
to
be
severe
to
any
one
,
*NL*
even
the
worst
in
the
school
:
she
sees
my
errors
,
and
tells
me
of
them
*NL*
gently
;
and
,
if
I
do
anything
worthy
of
praise
,
she
gives
me
my
meed
*NL*
liberally
.
One
strong
proof
of
my
wretchedly
defective
nature
is
,
that
*NL*
even
her
expostulations
,
so
mild
,
so
rational
,
have
not
influence
to
cure
*NL*
me
of
my
faults
;
and
even
her
praise
,
though
I
value
it
most
highly
,
*NL*
can
not
stimulate
me
to
continued
care
and
foresight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
curious
,
''
said
I
,
``
it
is
so
easy
to
be
careful

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
_
you
_
I
have
no
doubt
it
is

I
observed
you
in
your
class
this
*NL*
morning
,
and
saw
you
were
closely
attentive
:
your
thoughts
never
seemed
*NL*
to
wander
while
Miss
Miller
explained
the
lesson
and
questioned
you
.
Now
,
*NL*
mine
continually
rove
away
;
when
I
should
be
listening
to
Miss
Scatcherd
,
*NL*
and
collecting
all
she
says
with
assiduity
,
often
I
lose
the
very
sound
*NL*
of
her
voice
;
I
fall
into
a
sort
of
dream
.
Sometimes
I
think
I
am
in
*NL*
Northumberland
,
and
that
the
noises
I
hear
round
me
are
the
bubbling
of
a
*NL*
little
brook
which
runs
through
Deepden
,
near
our
house
;
--
then
,
when
it
*NL*
comes
to
my
turn
to
reply
,
I
have
to
be
awakened
;
and
having
heard
*NL*
nothing
of
what
was
read
for
listening
to
the
visionary
brook
,
I
have
no
*NL*
answer
ready
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
how
well
you
replied
this
afternoon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
mere
chance
;
the
subject
on
which
we
had
been
reading
had
*NL*
interested
me
.
This
afternoon
,
instead
of
dreaming
of
Deepden
,
I
was
*NL*
wondering
how
a
man
who
wished
to
do
right
could
act
so
unjustly
and
*NL*
unwisely
as
Charles
the
First
sometimes
did
;
and
I
thought
what
a
pity
it
*NL*
was
that
,
with
his
integrity
and
conscientiousness
,
he
could
see
no
*NL*
farther
than
the
prerogatives
of
the
crown
.
If
he
had
but
been
able
to
*NL*
look
to
a
distance
,
and
see
how
what
they
call
the
spirit
of
the
age
was
*NL*
tending
!
Still
,
I
like
Charles
--
I
respect
him
--
I
pity
him
,
poor
murdered
*NL*
king
!
Yes
,
his
enemies
were
the
worst
:
they
shed
blood
they
had
no
right
*NL*
to
shed
.
How
dared
they
kill
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Helen
was
talking
to
herself
now
:
she
had
forgotten
I
could
not
very
well
*NL*
understand
her
--
that
I
was
ignorant
,
or
nearly
so
,
of
the
subject
she
*NL*
discussed
.
I
recalled
her
to
my
level
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
when
Miss
Temple
teaches
you
,
do
your
thoughts
wander
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
certainly
,
not
often
;
because
Miss
Temple
has
generally
something
to
*NL*
say
which
is
newer
than
my
own
reflections
;
her
language
is
singularly
*NL*
agreeable
to
me
,
and
the
information
she
communicates
is
often
just
what
*NL*
I
wished
to
gain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
with
Miss
Temple
you
are
good
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
in
a
passive
way
:
I
make
no
effort
;
I
follow
as
inclination
guides
*NL*
me
.
There
is
no
merit
in
such
goodness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
great
deal

you
are
good
to
those
who
are
good
to
you

It
is
all
I
*NL*
ever
desire
to
be
.
If
people
were
always
kind
and
obedient
to
those
who
*NL*
are
cruel
and
unjust
,
the
wicked
people
would
have
it
all
their
own
way

they
would
never
feel
afraid
,
and
so
they
would
never
alter
,

would
*NL*
grow
worse
and
worse
.
When
we
are
struck
at
without
a
reason

we
should
*NL*
strike
back
again
very
hard

I
am
sure
we
should

so
hard

struck
us
never

do
it
again

*NL*
``
You
will
change
your

a
little
untaught

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
feel
this

Helen

I
must
dislike
those

persist
in
disliking
me

I
must
resist
those

*NL*
unjustly

It
is
as
natural
as
that
I
should
love
those
who
show
me
*NL*
affection
,

submit
to
punishment
when
I
feel
it
is
deserved
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Heathens
and
savage
tribes
hold
that
doctrine

disown
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
How

I
do

It

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Read
the

In
her
turn

Helen
Burns
asked
me
to
explain

I
proceeded
forthwith

to
pour
out
,
in
my

the
tale
of
my
sufferings

resentments

*NL*
Bitter

truculent

excited

spoke
as
I
felt
,
without
reserve
or
*NL*
softening

*NL*
*NL*
Helen
heard
me
patiently
to
the
end
:
I
expected
she
would
then
make
a
*NL*
remark
,
but
she
said
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
I
asked
impatiently
,
``
is
not
Mrs.
Reed
a
hard-hearted
,
bad
*NL*
woman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
been
unkind
to
you
,
no
doubt
;
because
you
see
,
she
dislikes
your
*NL*
cast
of
character
,
as
Miss
Scatcherd
does
mine
;
but
how
minutely
you
*NL*
remember
all
she
has
done
and
said
to
you
!
What
a
singularly
deep
*NL*
impression
her
injustice
seems
to
have
made
on
your
heart
!
No
ill-usage
*NL*
so
brands
its
record
on
my
feelings
.
Would
you
not
be
happier
if
you
*NL*
tried
to
forget
her
severity
,
together
with
the
passionate
emotions
it
*NL*
excited
?
Life
appears
to
me
too
short
to
be
spent
in
nursing
animosity
*NL*
or
registering
wrongs
.
We
are
,
and
must
be
,
one
and
all
,
burdened
with
*NL*
faults
in
this
world
:
but
the
time
will
soon
come
when
,
I
trust
,
we
shall
*NL*
put
them
off
in
putting
off
our
corruptible
bodies
;
when
debasement
and
*NL*
sin
will
fall
from
us
with
this
cumbrous
frame
of
flesh
,
and
only
the
*NL*
spark
of
the
spirit
will
remain
,
--
the
impalpable
principle
of
light
and
*NL*
thought
,
pure
as
when
it
left
the
Creator
to
inspire
the
creature
:
whence
*NL*
it
came
it
will
return
;
perhaps
again
to
be
communicated
to
some
being
*NL*
higher
than
man
--
perhaps
to
pass
through
gradations
of
glory
,
from
the
*NL*
pale
human
soul
to
brighten
to
the
seraph
!
Surely
it
will
never
,
on
the
*NL*
contrary
,
be
suffered
to
degenerate
from
man
to
fiend
?
No
;
I
can
not
*NL*
believe
that
:
I
hold
another
creed
:
which
no
one
ever
taught
me
,
and
*NL*
which
I
seldom
mention
;
but
in
which
I
delight
,
and
to
which
I
cling
:
for
*NL*
it
extends
hope
to
all
:
it
makes
Eternity
a
rest
--
a
mighty
home
,
not
a
*NL*
terror
and
an
abyss
.
Besides
,
with
this
creed
,
I
can
so
clearly
*NL*
distinguish
between
the
criminal
and
his
crime
;
I
can
so
sincerely
*NL*
forgive
the
first
while
I
abhor
the
last
:
with
this
creed
revenge
never
*NL*
worries
my
heart
,
degradation
never
too
deeply
disgusts
me
,
injustice
*NL*
never
crushes
me
too
low
:
I
live
in
calm
,
looking
to
the
end

*NL*
*NL*
Helen
's
head
,
always
drooping
,
sank
a
little
lower
as
she
finished
this
*NL*
sentence
.
I
saw
by
her
look
she
wished
no
longer
to
talk
to
me
,
but
*NL*
rather
to
converse
with
her
own
thoughts

She
was
not
allowed
much
time
*NL*
for
meditation
:
a
monitor
,
a
great
rough
girl
,
presently
came
up
,
*NL*
exclaiming
in
a
strong
Cumberland
accent
--
*NL*
*NL*
``

Helen
sighed
as
her
reverie
fled

getting
up

obeyed

CHAPTER
VII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
My
first
quarter
at
Lowood
seemed
an
age
;
and
not
the
golden
age
either
;
*NL*
it
comprised
an
irksome
struggle
with
difficulties
in
habituating
myself
*NL*
to
new
rules
and
unwonted
tasks
.
The
fear
of
failure
in
these
points
*NL*
harassed
me
worse
than
the
physical
hardships
of
my
lot
;
though
these
*NL*
were
no
trifles
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
January
,
February
,
and
part
of
March
,
the
deep
snows
,
and
,
after
*NL*
their
melting
,
the
almost
impassable
roads
,
prevented
our
stirring
beyond
*NL*
the
garden
walls
,
except
to
go
to
church
;
but
within
these
limits
we
had
*NL*
to
pass
an
hour
every
day
in
the
open
air
.
Our
clothing
was
insufficient
*NL*
to
protect
us
from
the
severe
cold
:
we
had
no
boots
,
the
snow
got
into
*NL*
our
shoes
and
melted
there
:
our
ungloved
hands
became
numbed
and
covered
*NL*
with
chilblains
,
as
were
our
feet
:
I
remember
well
the
distracting
*NL*
irritation
I
endured
from
this
cause
every
evening
,
when
my
feet
*NL*
inflamed
;
and
the
torture
of
thrusting
the
swelled
,
raw
,
and
stiff
toes
*NL*
into
my
shoes
in
the
morning
.
Then
the
scanty
supply
of
food
was
*NL*
distressing
:
with
the
keen
appetites
of
growing
children
,
we
had
scarcely
*NL*
sufficient
to
keep
alive
a
delicate
invalid
.
From
this
deficiency
of
*NL*
nourishment
resulted
an
abuse
,
which
pressed
hardly
on
the
younger
*NL*
pupils
:
whenever
the
famished
great
girls
had
an
opportunity
,
they
would
*NL*
coax
or
menace
the
little
ones
out
of
their
portion
.
Many
a
time
I
have
*NL*
shared
between
two
claimants
the
precious
morsel
of
brown
bread
*NL*
distributed
at
tea-time
;
and
after
relinquishing
to
a
third
half
the
*NL*
contents
of
my
mug
of
coffee
,
I
have
swallowed
the
remainder
with
an
*NL*
accompaniment
of
secret
tears
,
forced
from
me
by
the
exigency
of
hunger
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sundays
were
dreary
days
in
that
wintry
season
.
We
had
to
walk
two
miles
*NL*
to
Brocklebridge
Church
,
where
our
patron
officiated
.
We
set
out
cold
,
*NL*
we
arrived
at
church
colder
:
during
the
morning
service
we
became
almost
*NL*
paralysed
.
It
was
too
far
to
return
to
dinner
,
and
an
allowance
of
cold
*NL*
meat
and
bread
,
in
the
same
penurious
proportion
observed
in
our
ordinary
*NL*
meals
,
was
served
round
between
the
services
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
close
of
the
afternoon
service
we
returned
by
an
exposed
and
hilly
*NL*
road
,
where
the
bitter
winter
wind
,
blowing
over
a
range
of
snowy
summits
*NL*
to
the
north
,
almost
flayed
the
skin
from
our
faces
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
can
remember
Miss
Temple
walking
lightly
and
rapidly
along
our
drooping
*NL*
line
,
her
plaid
cloak
,
which
the
frosty
wind
fluttered
,
gathered
close
*NL*
about
her
,
and
encouraging
us
,
by
precept
and
example
,
to
keep
up
our
*NL*
spirits
,
and
march
forward
,
as
she
said
,
``
like
stalwart
soldiers
.
''
The
*NL*
other
teachers
,
poor
things
,
were
generally
themselves
too
much
dejected
*NL*
to
attempt
the
task
of
cheering
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
we
longed
for
the
light
and
heat
of
a
blazing
fire
when
we
got
back
!
*NL*
But
,
to
the
little
ones
at
least
,
this
was
denied
:
each
hearth
in
the
*NL*
schoolroom
was
immediately
surrounded
by
a
double
row
of
great
girls
,
and
*NL*
behind
them
the
younger
children
crouched
in
groups
,
wrapping
their
*NL*
starved
arms
in
their
pinafores
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
little
solace
came
at
tea-time
,
in
the
shape
of
a
double
ration
of
*NL*
bread
--
a
whole
,
instead
of
a
half
,
slice
--
with
the
delicious
addition
of
*NL*
a
thin
scrape
of
butter
:
it
was
the
hebdomadal
treat
to
which
we
all
*NL*
looked
forward
from
Sabbath
to
Sabbath
.
I
generally
contrived
to
reserve
*NL*
a
moiety
of
this
bounteous
repast
for
myself
;
but
the
remainder
I
was
*NL*
invariably
obliged
to
part
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Sunday
evening
was
spent
in
repeating
,
by
heart
,
the
Church
*NL*
Catechism
,
and
the
fifth
,
sixth
,
and
seventh
chapters
of
St.
Matthew
;
and
*NL*
in
listening
to
a
long
sermon
,
read
by
Miss
Miller
,
whose
irrepressible
*NL*
yawns
attested
her
weariness
.
A
frequent
interlude
of
these
performances
*NL*
was
the
enactment
of
the
part
of
Eutychus
by
some
half-dozen
of
little
*NL*
girls
,
who
,
overpowered
with
sleep
,
would
fall
down
,
if
not
out
of
the
*NL*
third
loft
,
yet
off
the
fourth
form
,
and
be
taken
up
half
dead
.
The
*NL*
remedy
was
,
to
thrust
them
forward
into
the
centre
of
the
schoolroom
,
and
*NL*
oblige
them
to
stand
there
till
the
sermon
was
finished
.
Sometimes
their
*NL*
feet
failed
them
,
and
they
sank
together
in
a
heap
;
they
were
then
*NL*
propped
up
with
the
monitors
'
high
stools
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
not
yet
alluded
to
the
visits
of
Mr.
Brocklehurst
;
and
indeed
that
*NL*
gentleman
was
from
home
during
the
greater
part
of
the
first
month
after
*NL*
my
arrival
;
perhaps
prolonging
his
stay
with
his
friend
the
archdeacon
:
*NL*
his
absence
was
a
relief
to
me
.
I
need
not
say
that
I
had
my
own
reasons
*NL*
for
dreading
his
coming
:
but
come
he
did
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
afternoon
-LRB-
I
had
then
been
three
weeks
at
Lowood
-RRB-
,
as
I
was
sitting
*NL*
with
a
slate
in
my
hand
,
puzzling
over
a
sum
in
long
division
,
my
eyes
,
*NL*
raised
in
abstraction
to
the
window
,
caught
sight
of
a
figure
just
*NL*
passing
:
I
recognised
almost
instinctively
that
gaunt
outline
;
and
when
,
*NL*
two
minutes
after
,
all
the
school
,
teachers
included
,
rose
_
en
masse
_
,
it
*NL*
was
not
necessary
for
me
to
look
up
in
order
to
ascertain
whose
entrance
*NL*
they
thus
greeted
.
A
long
stride
measured
the
schoolroom
,
and
presently
*NL*
beside
Miss
Temple
,
who
herself
had
risen
,
stood
the
same
black
column
*NL*
which
had
frowned
on
me
so
ominously
from
the
hearthrug
of
Gateshead
.
I
*NL*
now
glanced
sideways
at
this
piece
of
architecture
.
Yes
,
I
was
right
:
it
*NL*
was
Mr.
Brocklehurst
,
buttoned
up
in
a
surtout
,
and
looking
longer
,
*NL*
narrower
,
and
more
rigid
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
my
own
reasons
for
being
dismayed
at
this
apparition
;
too
well
I
*NL*
remembered
the
perfidious
hints
given
by
Mrs.
Reed
about
my
disposition
,
*NL*
&
c.
;
the
promise
pledged
by
Mr.
Brocklehurst
to
apprise
Miss
Temple
and
*NL*
the
teachers
of
my
vicious
nature
.
All
along
I
had
been
dreading
the
*NL*
fulfilment
of
this
promise
,
--
I
had
been
looking
out
daily
for
the
``
Coming
*NL*
Man
,
''
whose
information
respecting
my
past
life
and
conversation
was
to
*NL*
brand
me
as
a
bad
child
for
ever
:
now
there
he
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
at
Miss
Temple
's
side
;
he
was
speaking
low
in
her
ear
:
I
did
not
*NL*
doubt
he
was
making
disclosures
of
my
villainy
;
and
I
watched
her
eye
*NL*
with
painful
anxiety
,
expecting
every
moment
to
see
its
dark
orb
turn
on
*NL*
me
a
glance
of
repugnance
and
contempt
.
I
listened
too
;
and
as
I
*NL*
happened
to
be
seated
quite
at
the
top
of
the
room
,
I
caught
most
of
what
*NL*
he
said
:
its
import
relieved
me
from
immediate
apprehension
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
,
Miss
Temple
,
the
thread
I
bought
at
Lowton
will
do
;
it
struck
*NL*
me
that
it
would
be
just
of
the
quality
for
the
calico
chemises
,
and
I
*NL*
sorted
the
needles
to
match
.
You
may
tell
Miss
Smith
that
I
forgot
to
*NL*
make
a
memorandum
of
the
darning
needles
,
but
she
shall
have
some
papers
*NL*
sent
in
next
week
;
and
she
is
not
,
on
any
account
,
to
give
out
more
than
*NL*
one
at
a
time
to
each
pupil
:
if
they
have
more
,
they
are
apt
to
be
*NL*
careless
and
lose
them
.
And
,
O
ma'am
!
I
wish
the
woollen
stockings
were
*NL*
better
looked
to
!
--
when
I
was
here
last
,
I
went
into
the
kitchen-garden
*NL*
and
examined
the
clothes
drying
on
the
line
;
there
was
a
quantity
of
*NL*
black
hose
in
a
very
bad
state
of
repair
:
from
the
size
of
the
holes
in
*NL*
them
I
was
sure
they
had
not
been
well
mended
from
time
to
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
directions
shall
be
attended
to
,
sir
,
''
said
Miss
Temple
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
,
ma'am
,
''
he
continued
,
``
the
laundress
tells
me
some
of
the
girls
*NL*
have
two
clean
tuckers
in
the
week
:
it
is
too
much
;
the
rules
limit
them
*NL*
to
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
can
explain
that
circumstance
,
sir
.
Agnes
and
Catherine
*NL*
Johnstone
were
invited
to
take
tea
with
some
friends
at
Lowton
last
*NL*
Thursday
,
and
I
gave
them
leave
to
put
on
clean
tuckers
for
the
*NL*
occasion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Brocklehurst
nodded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
for
once
it
may
pass
;
but
please
not
to
let
the
circumstance
occur
*NL*
too
often
.
And
there
is
another
thing
which
surprised
me
;
I
find
,
in
*NL*
settling
accounts
with
the
housekeeper
,
that
a
lunch
,
consisting
of
bread
*NL*
and
cheese
,
has
twice
been
served
out
to
the
girls
during
the
past
*NL*
fortnight
.
How
is
this
?
I
looked
over
the
regulations
,
and
I
find
no
*NL*
such
meal
as
lunch
mentioned
.
Who
introduced
this
innovation
?
and
by
*NL*
what
authority
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
be
responsible
for
the
circumstance
,
sir
,
''
replied
Miss
Temple
:
*NL*
``
the
breakfast
was
so
ill
prepared
that
the
pupils
could
not
possibly
eat
*NL*
it
;
and
I
dared
not
allow
them
to
remain
fasting
till
dinner-time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madam
,
allow
me
an
instant
.
You
are
aware
that
my
plan
in
bringing
up
*NL*
these
girls
is
,
not
to
accustom
them
to
habits
of
luxury
and
indulgence
,
*NL*
but
to
render
them
hardy
,
patient
,
self-denying
.
Should
any
little
*NL*
accidental
disappointment
of
the
appetite
occur
,
such
as
the
spoiling
of
*NL*
a
meal
,
the
under
or
the
over
dressing
of
a
dish
,
the
incident
ought
not
*NL*
to
be
neutralised
by
replacing
with
something
more
delicate
the
comfort
*NL*
lost
,
thus
pampering
the
body
and
obviating
the
aim
of
this
institution
;
*NL*
it
ought
to
be
improved
to
the
spiritual
edification
of
the
pupils
,
by
*NL*
encouraging
them
to
evince
fortitude
under
temporary
privation
.
A
brief
*NL*
address
on
those
occasions
would
not
be
mistimed
,
wherein
a
judicious
*NL*
instructor
would
take
the
opportunity
of
referring
to
the
sufferings
of
*NL*
the
primitive
Christians
;
to
the
torments
of
martyrs
;
to
the
exhortations
*NL*
of
our
blessed
Lord
Himself
,
calling
upon
His
disciples
to
take
up
their
*NL*
cross
and
follow
Him
;
to
His
warnings
that
man
shall
not
live
by
bread
*NL*
alone
,
but
by
every
word
that
proceedeth
out
of
the
mouth
of
God
;
to
His
*NL*
divine
consolations
,
``
If
ye
suffer
hunger
or
thirst
for
My
sake
,
happy
*NL*
are
ye
.
''
Oh
,
madam
,
when
you
put
bread
and
cheese
,
instead
of
burnt
*NL*
porridge
,
into
these
children
's
mouths
,
you
may
indeed
feed
their
vile
*NL*
bodies
,
but
you
little
think
how
you
starve
their
immortal
souls
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Brocklehurst
again
paused
--
perhaps
overcome
by
his
feelings
.
Miss
*NL*
Temple
had
looked
down
when
he
first
began
to
speak
to
her
;
but
she
now
*NL*
gazed
straight
before
her
,
and
her
face
,
naturally
pale
as
marble
,
*NL*
appeared
to
be
assuming
also
the
coldness
and
fixity
of
that
material
;
*NL*
especially
her
mouth
,
closed
as
if
it
would
have
required
a
sculptor
's
*NL*
chisel
to
open
it
,
and
her
brow
settled
gradually
into
petrified
*NL*
severity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meantime
,
Mr.
Brocklehurst
,
standing
on
the
hearth
with
his
hands
behind
*NL*
his
back
,
majestically
surveyed
the
whole
school
.
Suddenly
his
eye
gave
*NL*
a
blink
,
as
if
it
had
met
something
that
either
dazzled
or
shocked
its
*NL*
pupil
;
turning
,
he
said
in
more
rapid
accents
than
he
had
hitherto
used
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Temple
,
Miss
Temple
,
what
--
_
what
_
is
that
girl
with
curled
hair
?
*NL*
Red
hair
,
ma'am
,
curled
--
curled
all
over
?
''
And
extending
his
cane
he
*NL*
pointed
to
the
awful
object
,
his
hand
shaking
as
he
did
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
Julia
Severn
,
''
replied
Miss
Temple
,
very
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Julia
Severn
,
ma'am
!
And
why
has
she
,
or
any
other
,
curled
hair
?
Why
,
*NL*
in
defiance
of
every
precept
and
principle
of
this
house
,
does
she
*NL*
conform
to
the
world
so
openly
--
here
in
an
evangelical
,
charitable
*NL*
establishment
--
as
to
wear
her
hair
one
mass
of
curls
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Julia
's
hair
curls
naturally
,
''
returned
Miss
Temple
,
still
more
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Naturally
!
Yes
,
but
we
are
not
to
conform
to
nature
;
I
wish
these
girls
*NL*
to
be
the
children
of
Grace
:
and
why
that
abundance
?
I
have
again
and
*NL*
again
intimated
that
I
desire
the
hair
to
be
arranged
closely
,
modestly
,
*NL*
plainly
.
Miss
Temple
,
that
girl
's
hair
must
be
cut
off
entirely
;
I
will
*NL*
send
a
barber
to-morrow
:
and
I
see
others
who
have
far
too
much
of
the
*NL*
excrescence
--
that
tall
girl
,
tell
her
to
turn
round
.
Tell
all
the
first
*NL*
form
to
rise
up
and
direct
their
faces
to
the
wall
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Temple
passed
her
handkerchief
over
her
lips
,
as
if
to
smooth
away
*NL*
the
involuntary
smile
that
curled
them
;
she
gave
the
order
,
however
,
and
*NL*
when
the
first
class
could
take
in
what
was
required
of
them
,
they
*NL*
obeyed
.
Leaning
a
little
back
on
my
bench
,
I
could
see
the
looks
and
*NL*
grimaces
with
which
they
commented
on
this
manoeuvre
:
it
was
a
pity
Mr.
*NL*
Brocklehurst
could
not
see
them
too
;
he
would
perhaps
have
felt
that
,
*NL*
whatever
he
might
do
with
the
outside
of
the
cup
and
platter
,
the
inside
*NL*
was
further
beyond
his
interference
than
he
imagined
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
scrutinised
the
reverse
of
these
living
medals
some
five
minutes
,
then
*NL*
pronounced
sentence
.
These
words
fell
like
the
knell
of
doom
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
those
top-knots
must
be
cut
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Temple
seemed
to
remonstrate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madam
,
''
he
pursued
,
``
I
have
a
Master
to
serve
whose
kingdom
is
not
of
*NL*
this
world
:
my
mission
is
to
mortify
in
these
girls
the
lusts
of
the
*NL*
flesh
;
to
teach
them
to
clothe
themselves
with
shame-facedness
and
*NL*
sobriety
,
not
with
braided
hair
and
costly
apparel
;
and
each
of
the
young
*NL*
persons
before
us
has
a
string
of
hair
twisted
in
plaits
which
vanity
*NL*
itself
might
have
woven
;
these
,
I
repeat
,
must
be
cut
off
;
think
of
the
*NL*
time
wasted
,
of

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Brocklehurst
was
here
interrupted
:
three
other
visitors
,
ladies
,
now
*NL*
entered
the
room
.
They
ought
to
have
come
a
little
sooner
to
have
heard
*NL*
his
lecture
on
dress
,
for
they
were
splendidly
attired
in
velvet
,
silk
,
*NL*
and
furs
.
The
two
younger
of
the
trio
-LRB-
fine
girls
of
sixteen
and
*NL*
seventeen
-RRB-
had
grey
beaver
hats
,
then
in
fashion
,
shaded
with
ostrich
*NL*
plumes
,
and
from
under
the
brim
of
this
graceful
head-dress
fell
a
*NL*
profusion
of
light
tresses
,
elaborately
curled
;
the
elder
lady
was
*NL*
enveloped
in
a
costly
velvet
shawl
,
trimmed
with
ermine
,
and
she
wore
a
*NL*
false
front
of
French
curls
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
ladies
were
deferentially
received
by
Miss
Temple
,
as
Mrs.
and
the
*NL*
Misses
Brocklehurst
,
and
conducted
to
seats
of
honour
at
the
top
of
the
*NL*
room
.
It
seems
they
had
come
in
the
carriage
with
their
reverend
*NL*
relative
,
and
had
been
conducting
a
rummaging
scrutiny
of
the
room
*NL*
upstairs
,
while
he
transacted
business
with
the
housekeeper
,
questioned
*NL*
the
laundress
,
and
lectured
the
superintendent
.
They
now
proceeded
to
*NL*
address
divers
remarks
and
reproofs
to
Miss
Smith
,
who
was
charged
with
*NL*
the
care
of
the
linen
and
the
inspection
of
the
dormitories
:
but
I
had
no
*NL*
time
to
listen
to
what
they
said
;
other
matters
called
off
and
enchanted
*NL*
my
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hitherto
,
while
gathering
up
the
discourse
of
Mr.
Brocklehurst
and
Miss
*NL*
Temple
,
I
had
not
,
at
the
same
time
,
neglected
precautions
to
secure
my
*NL*
personal
safety
;
which
I
thought
would
be
effected
,
if
I
could
only
elude
*NL*
observation
.
To
this
end
,
I
had
sat
well
back
on
the
form
,
and
while
*NL*
seeming
to
be
busy
with
my
sum
,
had
held
my
slate
in
such
a
manner
as
to
*NL*
conceal
my
face
:
I
might
have
escaped
notice
,
had
not
my
treacherous
*NL*
slate
somehow
happened
to
slip
from
my
hand
,
and
falling
with
an
*NL*
obtrusive
crash
,
directly
drawn
every
eye
upon
me
;
I
knew
it
was
all
over
*NL*
now
,
and
,
as
I
stooped
to
pick
up
the
two
fragments
of
slate
,
I
rallied
*NL*
my
forces
for
the
worst
.
It
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
careless
girl
!
''
said
Mr.
Brocklehurst
,
and
immediately
after
--
``
It
is
*NL*
the
new
pupil
,
I
perceive
.
''
And
before
I
could
draw
breath
,
``
I
must
not
*NL*
forget
I
have
a
word
to
say
respecting
her
.
''
Then
aloud
:
how
loud
it
*NL*
seemed
to
me
!
``
Let
the
child
who
broke
her
slate
come
forward
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Of
my
own
accord
I
could
not
have
stirred
;
I
was
paralysed
:
but
the
two
*NL*
great
girls
who
sit
on
each
side
of
me
,
set
me
on
my
legs
and
pushed
me
*NL*
towards
the
dread
judge
,
and
then
Miss
Temple
gently
assisted
me
to
his
*NL*
very
feet
,
and
I
caught
her
whispered
counsel
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
afraid
,
Jane
,
I
saw
it
was
an
accident
;
you
shall
not
be
*NL*
punished
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
kind
whisper
went
to
my
heart
like
a
dagger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Another
minute
,
and
she
will
despise
me
for
a
hypocrite
,
''
thought
I
;
and
*NL*
an
impulse
of
fury
against
Reed
,
Brocklehurst
,
and
Co.
bounded
in
my
*NL*
pulses
at
the
conviction
.
I
was
no
Helen
Burns
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fetch
that
stool
,
''
said
Mr.
Brocklehurst
,
pointing
to
a
very
high
one
*NL*
from
which
a
monitor
had
just
risen
:
it
was
brought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Place
the
child
upon
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
I
was
placed
there
,
by
whom
I
do
n't
know
:
I
was
in
no
condition
to
*NL*
note
particulars
;
I
was
only
aware
that
they
had
hoisted
me
up
to
the
*NL*
height
of
Mr.
Brocklehurst
's
nose
,
that
he
was
within
a
yard
of
me
,
and
*NL*
that
a
spread
of
shot
orange
and
purple
silk
pelisses
and
a
cloud
of
*NL*
silvery
plumage
extended
and
waved
below
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Brocklehurst
hemmed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ladies
,
''
said
he
,
turning
to
his
family
,
``
Miss
Temple
,
teachers
,
and
*NL*
children
,
you
all
see
this
girl
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
they
did
;
for
I
felt
their
eyes
directed
like
burning-glasses
*NL*
against
my
scorched
skin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
she
is
yet
young
;
you
observe
she
possesses
the
ordinary
form
of
*NL*
childhood
;
God
has
graciously
given
her
the
shape
that
He
has
given
to
*NL*
all
of
us
;
no
signal
deformity
points
her
out
as
a
marked
character
.
Who
*NL*
would
think
that
the
Evil
One
had
already
found
a
servant
and
agent
in
*NL*
her
?
Yet
such
,
I
grieve
to
say
,
is
the
case
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
pause
--
in
which
I
began
to
steady
the
palsy
of
my
nerves
,
and
to
feel
*NL*
that
the
Rubicon
was
passed
;
and
that
the
trial
,
no
longer
to
be
shirked
,
*NL*
must
be
firmly
sustained
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
children
,
''
pursued
the
black
marble
clergyman
,
with
pathos
,
*NL*
``
this
is
a
sad
,
a
melancholy
occasion
;
for
it
becomes
my
duty
to
warn
*NL*
you
,
that
this
girl
,
who
might
be
one
of
God
's
own
lambs
,
is
a
little
*NL*
castaway
:
not
a
member
of
the
true
flock
,
but
evidently
an
interloper
and
*NL*
an
alien
.
You
must
be
on
your
guard
against
her
;
you
must
shun
her
*NL*
example
;
if
necessary
,
avoid
her
company
,
exclude
her
from
your
sports
,
*NL*
and
shut
her
out
from
your
converse
.
Teachers
,
you
must
watch
her
:
keep
*NL*
your
eyes
on
her
movements
,
weigh
well
her
words
,
scrutinise
her
actions
,
*NL*
punish
her
body
to
save
her
soul
:
if
,
indeed
,
such
salvation
be
possible
,
*NL*
for
-LRB-
my
tongue
falters
while
I
tell
it
-RRB-
this
girl
,
this
child
,
the
native
*NL*
of
a
Christian
land
,
worse
than
many
a
little
heathen
who
says
its
*NL*
prayers
to
Brahma
and
kneels
before
Juggernaut
--
this
girl
is
--
a
liar
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Now
came
a
pause
of
ten
minutes
,
during
which
I
,
by
this
time
in
perfect
*NL*
possession
of
my
wits
,
observed
all
the
female
Brocklehursts
produce
*NL*
their
pocket-handkerchiefs
and
apply
them
to
their
optics
,
while
the
*NL*
elderly
lady
swayed
herself
to
and
fro
,
and
the
two
younger
ones
*NL*
whispered
,
``
How
shocking
!
''
Mr.
Brocklehurst
resumed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
I
learned
from
her
benefactress
;
from
the
pious
and
charitable
lady
*NL*
who
adopted
her
in
her
orphan
state
,
reared
her
as
her
own
daughter
,
and
*NL*
whose
kindness
,
whose
generosity
the
unhappy
girl
repaid
by
an
*NL*
ingratitude
so
bad
,
so
dreadful
,
that
at
last
her
excellent
patroness
was
*NL*
obliged
to
separate
her
from
her
own
young
ones
,
fearful
lest
her
vicious
*NL*
example
should
contaminate
their
purity
:
she
has
sent
her
here
to
be
*NL*
healed
,
even
as
the
Jews
of
old
sent
their
diseased
to
the
troubled
pool
*NL*
of
Bethesda
;
and
,
teachers
,
superintendent
,
I
beg
of
you
not
to
allow
the
*NL*
waters
to
stagnate
round
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
sublime
conclusion
,
Mr.
Brocklehurst
adjusted
the
top
button
of
*NL*
his
surtout
,
muttered
something
to
his
family
,
who
rose
,
bowed
to
Miss
*NL*
Temple
,
and
then
all
the
great
people
sailed
in
state
from
the
room
.
*NL*
Turning
at
the
door
,
my
judge
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
her
stand
half-an-hour
longer
on
that
stool
,
and
let
no
one
speak
to
*NL*
her
during
the
remainder
of
the
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
I
,
then
,
mounted
aloft
;
I
,
who
had
said
I
could
not
bear
the
*NL*
shame
of
standing
on
my
natural
feet
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
was
now
*NL*
exposed
to
general
view
on
a
pedestal
of
infamy
.
What
my
sensations
were
*NL*
no
language
can
describe
;
but
just
as
they
all
rose
,
stifling
my
breath
*NL*
and
constricting
my
throat
,
a
girl
came
up
and
passed
me
:
in
passing
,
she
*NL*
lifted
her
eyes
.
What
a
strange
light
inspired
them
!
What
an
*NL*
extraordinary
sensation
that
ray
sent
through
me
!
How
the
new
feeling
*NL*
bore
me
up
!
It
was
as
if
a
martyr
,
a
hero
,
had
passed
a
slave
or
victim
,
*NL*
and
imparted
strength
in
the
transit
.
I
mastered
the
rising
hysteria
,
*NL*
lifted
up
my
head
,
and
took
a
firm
stand
on
the
stool
.
Helen
Burns
asked
*NL*
some
slight
question
about
her
work
of
Miss
Smith
,
was
chidden
for
the
*NL*
triviality
of
the
inquiry
,
returned
to
her
place
,
and
smiled
at
me
as
she
*NL*
again
went
by
.
What
a
smile
!
I
remember
it
now
,
and
I
know
that
it
was
*NL*
the
effluence
of
fine
intellect
,
of
true
courage
;
it
lit
up
her
marked
*NL*
lineaments
,
her
thin
face
,
her
sunken
grey
eye
,
like
a
reflection
from
*NL*
the
aspect
of
an
angel
.
Yet
at
that
moment
Helen
Burns
wore
on
her
arm
*NL*
``
the
untidy
badge
;
''
scarcely
an
hour
ago
I
had
heard
her
condemned
by
*NL*
Miss
Scatcherd
to
a
dinner
of
bread
and
water
on
the
morrow
because
she
*NL*
had
blotted
an
exercise
in
copying
it
out
.
Such
is
the
imperfect
nature
*NL*
of
man
!
such
spots
are
there
on
the
disc
of
the
clearest
planet
;
and
eyes
*NL*
like
Miss
Scatcherd
's
can
only
see
those
minute
defects
,
and
are
blind
to
*NL*
the
full
brightness
of
the
orb
.

CHAPTER
VIII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Ere
the
half-hour
ended
,
five
o'clock
struck
;
school
was
dismissed
,
and
*NL*
all
were
gone
into
the
refectory
to
tea
.
I
now
ventured
to
descend
:
it
*NL*
was
deep
dusk
;
I
retired
into
a
corner
and
sat
down
on
the
floor
.
The
*NL*
spell
by
which
I
had
been
so
far
supported
began
to
dissolve
;
reaction
*NL*
took
place
,
and
soon
,
so
overwhelming
was
the
grief
that
seized
me
,
I
*NL*
sank
prostrate
with
my
face
to
the
ground
.
Now
I
wept
:
Helen
Burns
was
*NL*
not
here
;
nothing
sustained
me
;
left
to
myself
I
abandoned
myself
,
and
my
*NL*
tears
watered
the
boards
.
I
had
meant
to
be
so
good
,
and
to
do
so
much
*NL*
at
Lowood
:
to
make
so
many
friends
,
to
earn
respect
and
win
affection
.
*NL*
Already
I
had
made
visible
progress
:
that
very
morning
I
had
reached
the
*NL*
head
of
my
class
;
Miss
Miller
had
praised
me
warmly
;
Miss
Temple
had
*NL*
smiled
approbation
;
she
had
promised
to
teach
me
drawing
,
and
to
let
me
*NL*
learn
French
,
if
I
continued
to
make
similar
improvement
two
months
*NL*
longer
:
and
then
I
was
well
received
by
my
fellow-pupils
;
treated
as
an
*NL*
equal
by
those
of
my
own
age
,
and
not
molested
by
any
;
now
,
here
I
lay
*NL*
again
crushed
and
trodden
on
;
and
could
I
ever
rise
more
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
,
''
I
thought
;
and
ardently
I
wished
to
die
.
While
sobbing
out
this
*NL*
wish
in
broken
accents
,
some
one
approached
:
I
started
up
--
again
Helen
*NL*
Burns
was
near
me
;
the
fading
fires
just
showed
her
coming
up
the
long
,
*NL*
vacant
room
;
she
brought
my
coffee
and
bread
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
eat
something
,
''
she
said
;
but
I
put
both
away
from
me
,
feeling
as
*NL*
if
a
drop
or
a
crumb
would
have
choked
me
in
my
present
condition
.
Helen
*NL*
regarded
me
,
probably
with
surprise
:
I
could
not
now
abate
my
agitation
,
*NL*
though
I
tried
hard
;
I
continued
to
weep
aloud
.
She
sat
down
on
the
*NL*
ground
near
me
,
embraced
her
knees
with
her
arms
,
and
rested
her
head
*NL*
upon
them
;
in
that
attitude
she
remained
silent
as
an
Indian
.
I
was
the
*NL*
first
who
spoke
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Helen
,
why
do
you
stay
with
a
girl
whom
everybody
believes
to
be
a
*NL*
liar
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everybody
,
Jane
?
Why
,
there
are
only
eighty
people
who
have
heard
you
*NL*
called
so
,
and
the
world
contains
hundreds
of
millions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
have
I
to
do
with
millions
?
The
eighty
,
I
know
,
despise
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jane
,
you
are
mistaken
:
probably
not
one
in
the
school
either
despises
*NL*
or
dislikes
you
:
many
,
I
am
sure
,
pity
you
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
they
pity
me
after
what
Mr.
Brocklehurst
has
said
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Brocklehurst
is
not
a
god
:
nor
is
he
even
a
great
and
admired
man
:
*NL*
he
is
little
liked
here
;
he
never
took
steps
to
make
himself
liked
.
Had
*NL*
he
treated
you
as
an
especial
favourite
,
you
would
have
found
enemies
,
*NL*
declared
or
covert
,
all
around
you
;
as
it
is
,
the
greater
number
would
*NL*
offer
you
sympathy
if
they
dared
.
Teachers
and
pupils
may
look
coldly
on
*NL*
you
for
a
day
or
two
,
but
friendly
feelings
are
concealed
in
their
*NL*
hearts
;
and
if
you
persevere
in
doing
well
,
these
feelings
will
ere
long
*NL*
appear
so
much
the
more
evidently
for
their
temporary
suppression
.
*NL*
Besides
,
Jane
''
--
she
paused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Helen
?
''
said
I
,
putting
my
hand
into
hers
:
she
chafed
my
fingers
*NL*
gently
to
warm
them
,
and
went
on
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
all
the
world
hated
you
,
and
believed
you
wicked
,
while
your
own
*NL*
conscience
approved
you
,
and
absolved
you
from
guilt
,
you
would
not
be
*NL*
without
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
know
I
should
think
well
of
myself
;
but
that
is
not
enough
:
if
*NL*
others
do
n't
love
me
I
would
rather
die
than
live
--
I
can
not
bear
to
be
*NL*
solitary
and
hated
,
Helen
.
Look
here
;
to
gain
some
real
affection
from
*NL*
you
,
or
Miss
Temple
,
or
any
other
whom
I
truly
love
,
I
would
willingly
*NL*
submit
to
have
the
bone
of
my
arm
broken
,
or
to
let
a
bull
toss
me
,
or
to
*NL*
stand
behind
a
kicking
horse
,
and
let
it
dash
its
hoof
at
my
chest
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
,
Jane
!
you
think
too
much
of
the
love
of
human
beings
;
you
are
too
*NL*
impulsive

too
vehement
;
the
sovereign
hand
that
created
your
frame
,
and
*NL*
put
life
into
it
,
has
provided
you
with
other
resources
than
your
feeble

self

or
than
creatures
feeble
as
you
.
Besides
this
earth
,
and
besides
*NL*
the
race
of
men
,
there
is
an
invisible
world
and
a
kingdom
of
spirits

*NL*
that
world
is
round
us

for
it
is
everywhere
;
and
those
spirits
watch
us

for
they
are
commissioned
to
guard
us
;
and
if

were
dying
in
pain

scorn
smote

hatred
crushed
us
,
angels
see
*NL*
our
tortures
,
recognise
our
innocence
-LRB-
if
innocent
we
be
:
as
I
know
you
*NL*
are
of
this
charge
which
Mr.
Brocklehurst
has
weakly
and
pompously
*NL*
repeated
at
second-hand
from
Mrs.
Reed
;
for
I
read
a
sincere
nature
in
*NL*
your
ardent
eyes
and
on
your
clear
front
-RRB-
,
and
God
waits
only
the
*NL*
separation
of
spirit
from
flesh
to
crown
us
with
a
full
reward
.
Why
,
*NL*
then
,
should
we
ever
sink
overwhelmed
with
distress
,
when
life
is
so
soon
*NL*
over
,
and
death
is
so
certain
an
entrance
to
happiness
--
to
glory
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
silent
;
Helen
had
calmed
me
;
but
in
the
tranquillity
she
imparted
*NL*
there
was
an
alloy
of
inexpressible
sadness
.
I
felt
the
impression
of
*NL*
woe
as
she
spoke
,
but
I
could
not
tell
whence
it
came
;
and
when
,
having
*NL*
done
speaking
,
she
breathed
a
little
fast
and
coughed
a
short
cough
,
I
*NL*
momentarily
forgot
my
own
sorrows
to
yield
to
a
vague
concern
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Resting
my
head
on
Helen
's
shoulder
,
I
put
my
arms
round
her
waist
;
she
*NL*
drew
me
to
her
,
and
we
reposed
in
silence
.
We
had
not
sat
long
thus
,
*NL*
when
another
person
came
in
.
Some
heavy
clouds
,
swept
from
the
sky
by
a
*NL*
rising
wind
,
had
left
the
moon
bare
;
and
her
light
,
streaming
in
through
*NL*
a
window
near
,
shone
full
both
on
us
and
on
the
approaching
figure
,
which
*NL*
we
at
once
recognised
as
Miss
Temple
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
came
on
purpose
to
find
you
,
Jane
Eyre
,
''
said
she
;
``
I
want
you
in
my
*NL*
room
;
and
as
Helen
Burns
is
with
you
,
she
may
come
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
went
;
following
the
superintendent
's
guidance
,
we
had
to
thread
some
*NL*
intricate
passages
,
and
mount
a
staircase
before
we
reached
her
*NL*
apartment
;
it
contained
a
good
fire
,
and
looked
cheerful
.
Miss
Temple
*NL*
told
Helen
Burns
to
be
seated
in
a
low
arm-chair
on
one
side
of
the
*NL*
hearth
,
and
herself
taking
another
,
she
called
me
to
her
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
all
over
?
''
she
asked
,
looking
down
at
my
face
.
``
Have
you
cried
*NL*
your
grief
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
I
never
shall
do
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
have
been
wrongly
accused
;
and
you
,
ma'am
,
and
everybody
else
,
*NL*
will
now
think
me
wicked
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
think
you
what
you
prove
yourself
to
be
,
my
child
.
Continue
to
*NL*
act
as
a
good
girl
,
and
you
will
satisfy
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
,
Miss
Temple
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
,
''
said
she
,
passing
her
arm
round
me
.
``
And
now
tell
me
who
is
*NL*
the
lady
whom
Mr.
Brocklehurst
called
your
benefactress
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Reed
,
my
uncle
's
wife
.
My
uncle
is
dead
,
and
he
left
me
to
her
*NL*
care
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
she
not
,
then
,
adopt
you
of
her
own
accord
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
ma'am
;
she
was
sorry
to
have
to
do
it
:
but
my
uncle
,
as
I
have
often
*NL*
heard
the
servants
say
,
got
her
to
promise
before
he
died
that
she
would
*NL*
always
keep
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
Jane
,
you
know
,
or
at
least
I
will
tell
you
,
that
when
a
*NL*
criminal
is
accused
,
he
is
always
allowed
to
speak
in
his
own
defence
.
*NL*
You
have
been
charged
with
falsehood
;
defend
yourself
to
me
as
well
as
*NL*
you
can
.
Say
whatever
your
memory
suggests
is
true
;
but
add
nothing
and
*NL*
exaggerate
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
resolved
,
in
the
depth
of
my
heart
,
that
I
would
be
most
moderate
--
most
*NL*
correct
;
and
,
having
reflected
a
few
minutes
in
order
to
arrange
*NL*
coherently
what
I
had
to
say
,
I
told
her
all
the
story
of
my
sad
*NL*
childhood
.
Exhausted
by
emotion
,
my
language
was
more
subdued
than
it
*NL*
generally
was
when
it
developed
that
sad
theme
;
and
mindful
of
Helen
's
*NL*
warnings
against
the
indulgence
of
resentment
,
I
infused
into
the
*NL*
narrative
far
less
of
gall
and
wormwood
than
ordinary
.
Thus
restrained
*NL*
and
simplified
,
it
sounded
more
credible
:
I
felt
as
I
went
on
that
Miss
*NL*
Temple
fully
believed
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
course
of
the
tale
I
had
mentioned
Mr.
Lloyd
as
having
come
to
see
*NL*
me
after
the
fit
:
for
I
never
forgot
the
,
to
me
,
frightful
episode
of
the
*NL*
red-room
:
in
detailing
which
,
my
excitement
was
sure
,
in
some
degree
,
to
*NL*
break
bounds
;
for
nothing
could
soften
in
my
recollection
the
spasm
of
*NL*
agony
which
clutched
my
heart
when
Mrs.
Reed
spurned
my
wild
supplication
*NL*
for
pardon
,
and
locked
me
a
second
time
in
the
dark
and
haunted
chamber
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
finished
:
Miss
Temple
regarded
me
a
few
minutes
in
silence
;
she
*NL*
then
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
something
of
Mr.
Lloyd
;
I
shall
write
to
him
;
if
his
reply
agrees
*NL*
with
your
statement
,
you
shall
be
publicly
cleared
from
every
imputation
;
*NL*
to
me
,
Jane
,
you
are
clear
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
kissed
me
,
and
still
keeping
me
at
her
side
-LRB-
where
I
was
well
*NL*
contented
to
stand
,
for
I
derived
a
child
's
pleasure
from
the
*NL*
contemplation
of
her
face
,
her
dress
,
her
one
or
two
ornaments
,
her
white
*NL*
forehead
,
her
clustered
and
shining
curls
,
and
beaming
dark
eyes
-RRB-
,
she
*NL*
proceeded
to
address
Helen
Burns
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
are
you
to-night
,
Helen
?
Have
you
coughed
much
to-day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
quite
so
much
,
I
think
,
ma'am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
pain
in
your
chest
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
little
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Temple
got
up
,
took
her
hand
and
examined
her
pulse
;
then
she
*NL*
returned
to
her
own
seat
:
as
she
resumed
it
,
I
heard
her
sigh
low
.
She
*NL*
was
pensive
a
few
minutes
,
then
rousing
herself
,
she
said
cheerfully
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
two
are
my
visitors
to-night
;
I
must
treat
you
as
such
.
''
She
*NL*
rang
her
bell
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Barbara
,
''
she
said
to
the
servant
who
answered
it
,
``
I
have
not
yet
had
*NL*
tea
;
bring
the
tray
and
place
cups
for
these
two
young
ladies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
a
tray
was
soon
brought
.
How
pretty
,
to
my
eyes
,
did
the
china
cups
*NL*
and
bright
teapot
look
,
placed
on
the
little
round
table
near
the
fire
!
*NL*
How
fragrant
was
the
steam
of
the
beverage
,
and
the
scent
of
the
toast
!
*NL*
of
which
,
however
,
I
,
to
my
dismay
-LRB-
for
I
was
beginning
to
be
hungry
-RRB-
*NL*
discerned
only
a
very
small
portion
:
Miss
Temple
discerned
it
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Barbara
,
''
said
she
,
``
can
you
not
bring
a
little
more
bread
and
butter
?
*NL*
There
is
not
enough
for
three
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Barbara
went
out
:
she
returned
soon
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madam
,
Mrs.
Harden
says
she
has
sent
up
the
usual
quantity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Harden
,
be
it
observed
,
was
the
housekeeper
:
a
woman
after
Mr.
*NL*
Brocklehurst
's
own
heart
,
made
up
of
equal
parts
of
whalebone
and
iron
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
very
well
!
''
returned
Miss
Temple
;
``
we
must
make
it
do
,
Barbara
,
I
*NL*
suppose
.
''
And
as
the
girl
withdrew
she
added
,
smiling
,
``
Fortunately
,
I
*NL*
have
it
in
my
power
to
supply
deficiencies
for
this
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Having
invited
Helen
and
me
to
approach
the
table
,
and
placed
before
each
*NL*
of
us
a
cup
of
tea
with
one
delicious
but
thin
morsel
of
toast
,
she
got
*NL*
up
,
unlocked
a
drawer
,
and
taking
from
it
a
parcel
wrapped
in
paper
,
*NL*
disclosed
presently
to
our
eyes
a
good-sized
seed-cake
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
meant
to
give
each
of
you
some
of
this
to
take
with
you
,
''
said
she
,
*NL*
``
but
as
there
is
so
little
toast
,
you
must
have
it
now
,
''
and
she
*NL*
proceeded
to
cut
slices
with
a
generous
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
feasted
that
evening
as
on
nectar
and
ambrosia
;
and
not
the
least
*NL*
delight
of
the
entertainment
was
the
smile
of
gratification
with
which
*NL*
our
hostess
regarded
us
,
as
we
satisfied
our
famished
appetites
on
the
*NL*
delicate
fare
she
liberally
supplied
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tea
over
and
the
tray
removed
,
she
again
summoned
us
to
the
fire
;
we
sat
*NL*
one
on
each
side
of
her
,
and
now
a
conversation
followed
between
her
and
*NL*
Helen
,
which
it
was
indeed
a
privilege
to
be
admitted
to
hear
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Temple
had
always
something
of
serenity
in
her
air
,
of
state
in
her
*NL*
mien
,
of
refined
propriety
in
her
language
,
which
precluded
deviation
*NL*
into
the
ardent
,
the
excited
,
the
eager
:
something
which
chastened
the
*NL*
pleasure
of
those
who
looked
on
her
and
listened
to
her
,
by
a
controlling
*NL*
sense
of
awe
;
and
such
was
my
feeling
now
:
but
as
to
Helen
Burns
,
I
was
*NL*
struck
with
wonder
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
refreshing
meal
,
the
brilliant
fire
,
the
presence
and
kindness
of
her
*NL*
beloved
instructress
,
or
,
perhaps
,
more
than
all
these
,
something
in
her
*NL*
own
unique
mind
,
had
roused
her
powers
within
her
.
They
woke
,
they
*NL*
kindled
:
first
,
they
glowed
in
the
bright
tint
of
her
cheek
,
which
till
*NL*
this
hour
I
had
never
seen
but
pale
and
bloodless
;
then
they
shone
in
the
*NL*
liquid
lustre
of
her
eyes
,
which
had
suddenly
acquired
a
beauty
more
*NL*
singular
than
that
of
Miss
Temple
's
--
a
beauty
neither
of
fine
colour
nor
*NL*
long
eyelash
,
nor
pencilled
brow
,
but
of
meaning
,
of
movement
,
of
*NL*
radiance
.
Then
her
soul
sat
on
her
lips
,
and
language
flowed
,
from
what
*NL*
source
I
can
not
tell
.
Has
a
girl
of
fourteen
a
heart
large
enough
,
*NL*
vigorous
enough
,
to
hold
the
swelling
spring
of
pure
,
full
,
fervid
*NL*
eloquence
?
Such
was
the
characteristic
of
Helen
's
discourse
on
that
,
to
*NL*
me
,
memorable
evening
;
her
spirit
seemed
hastening
to
live
within
a
very
*NL*
brief
span
as
much
as
many
live
during
a
protracted
existence
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
conversed
of
things
I
had
never
heard
of
;
of
nations
and
times
past
;
*NL*
of
countries
far
away
;
of
secrets
of
nature
discovered
or
guessed
at
:
*NL*
they
spoke
of
books
:
how
many
they
had
read
!
What
stores
of
knowledge
*NL*
they
possessed
!
Then
they
seemed
so
familiar
with
French
names
and
*NL*
French
authors
:
but
my
amazement
reached
its
climax
when
Miss
Temple
*NL*
asked
Helen
if
she
sometimes
snatched
a
moment
to
recall
the
Latin
her
*NL*
father
had
taught
her
,
and
taking
a
book
from
a
shelf
,
bade
her
read
and
*NL*
construe
a
page
of
Virgil
;
and
Helen
obeyed
,
my
organ
of
veneration
*NL*
expanding
at
every
sounding
line
.
She
had
scarcely
finished
ere
the
bell
*NL*
announced
bedtime
!
no
delay
could
be
admitted
;
Miss
Temple
embraced
us
*NL*
both
,
saying
,
as
she
drew
us
to
her
heart
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
bless
you
,
my
children
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Helen
she
held
a
little
longer
than
me
:
she
let
her
go
more
reluctantly
;
*NL*
it
was
Helen
her
eye
followed
to
the
door
;
it
was
for
her
she
a
second
*NL*
time
breathed
a
sad
sigh
;
for
her
she
wiped
a
tear
from
her
cheek
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
reaching
the
bedroom
,
we
heard
the
voice
of
Miss
Scatcherd
:
she
was
*NL*
examining
drawers
;
she
had
just
pulled
out
Helen
Burns
's
,
and
when
we
*NL*
entered
Helen
was
greeted
with
a
sharp
reprimand
,
and
told
that
to-morrow
*NL*
she
should
have
half-a-dozen
of
untidily
folded
articles
pinned
to
her
*NL*
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
things
were
indeed
in
shameful
disorder
,
''
murmured
Helen
to
me
,
in
a
*NL*
low
voice
:
``
I
intended
to
have
arranged
them
,
but
I
forgot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Next
morning
,
Miss
Scatcherd
wrote
in
conspicuous
characters
on
a
piece
*NL*
of
pasteboard
the
word
``
Slattern
,
''
and
bound
it
like
a
phylactery
round
*NL*
Helen
's
large
,
mild
,
intelligent
,
and
benign-looking
forehead
.
She
wore
*NL*
it
till
evening
,
patient
,
unresentful
,
regarding
it
as
a
deserved
*NL*
punishment
.
The
moment
Miss
Scatcherd
withdrew
after
afternoon
school
,
I
*NL*
ran
to
Helen
,
tore
it
off
,
and
thrust
it
into
the
fire
:
the
fury
of
which
*NL*
she
was
incapable
had
been
burning
in
my
soul
all
day
,
and
tears
,
hot
and
*NL*
large
,
had
continually
been
scalding
my
cheek
;
for
the
spectacle
of
her
*NL*
sad
resignation
gave
me
an
intolerable
pain
at
the
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
a
week
subsequently
to
the
incidents
above
narrated
,
Miss
Temple
,
*NL*
who
had
written
to
Mr.
Lloyd
,
received
his
answer
:
it
appeared
that
what
*NL*
he
said
went
to
corroborate
my
account
.
Miss
Temple
,
having
assembled
*NL*
the
whole
school
,
announced
that
inquiry
had
been
made
into
the
charges
*NL*
alleged
against
Jane
Eyre
,
and
that
she
was
most
happy
to
be
able
to
*NL*
pronounce
her
completely
cleared
from
every
imputation
.
The
teachers
*NL*
then
shook
hands
with
me
and
kissed
me
,
and
a
murmur
of
pleasure
ran
*NL*
through
the
ranks
of
my
companions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
relieved
of
a
grievous
load
,
I
from
that
hour
set
to
work
afresh
,
*NL*
resolved
to
pioneer
my
way
through
every
difficulty
:
I
toiled
hard
,
and
*NL*
my
success
was
proportionate
to
my
efforts
;
my
memory
,
not
naturally
*NL*
tenacious
,
improved
with
practice
;
exercise
sharpened
my
wits
;
in
a
few
*NL*
weeks
I
was
promoted
to
a
higher
class
;
in
less
than
two
months
I
was
*NL*
allowed
to
commence
French
and
drawing
.
I
learned
the
first
two
tenses
*NL*
of
the
verb
_
Etre
_
,
and
sketched
my
first
cottage
-LRB-
whose
walls
,
by-the
-
*NL*
bye
,
outrivalled
in
slope
those
of
the
leaning
tower
of
Pisa
-RRB-
,
on
the
*NL*
same
day
.
That
night
,
on
going
to
bed
,
I
forgot
to
prepare
in
*NL*
imagination
the
Barmecide
supper
of
hot
roast
potatoes
,
or
white
bread
*NL*
and
new
milk
,
with
which
I
was
wont
to
amuse
my
inward
cravings
:
I
*NL*
feasted
instead
on
the
spectacle
of
ideal
drawings
,
which
I
saw
in
the
*NL*
dark
;
all
the
work
of
my
own
hands
:
freely
pencilled
houses
and
trees
,
*NL*
picturesque
rocks
and
ruins
,
Cuyp-like
groups
of
cattle
,
sweet
paintings
*NL*
of
butterflies
hovering
over
unblown
roses
,
of
birds
picking
at
ripe
*NL*
cherries
,
of
wren
's
nests
enclosing
pearl-like
eggs
,
wreathed
about
with
*NL*
young
ivy
sprays
.
I
examined
,
too
,
in
thought
,
the
possibility
of
my
*NL*
ever
being
able
to
translate
currently
a
certain
little
French
story
*NL*
which
Madame
Pierrot
had
that
day
shown
me
;
nor
was
that
problem
solved
*NL*
to
my
satisfaction
ere
I
fell
sweetly
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
has
Solomon
said
--
``
Better
is
a
dinner
of
herbs
where
love
is
,
than
a
*NL*
stalled
ox
and
hatred
therewith
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
would
not
now
have
exchanged
Lowood
with
all
its
privations
for
*NL*
Gateshead
and
its
daily
luxuries
.
*NL*

CHAPTER
IX
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
privations
,
or
rather
the
hardships
,
of
Lowood
lessened
.
Spring
*NL*
drew
on
:
she
was
indeed
already
come
;
the
frosts
of
winter
had
ceased
;
*NL*
its
snows
were
melted
,
its
cutting
winds
ameliorated
.
My
wretched
feet
,
*NL*
flayed
and
swollen
to
lameness
by
the
sharp
air
of
January
,
began
to
heal
*NL*
and
subside
under
the
gentler
breathings
of
April
;
the
nights
and
*NL*
mornings
no
longer
by
their
Canadian
temperature
froze
the
very
blood
in
*NL*
our
veins
;
we
could
now
endure
the
play-hour
passed
in
the
garden
:
*NL*
sometimes
on
a
sunny
day
it
began
even
to
be
pleasant
and
genial
,
and
a
*NL*
greenness
grew
over
those
brown
beds
,
which
,
freshening
daily
,
suggested
*NL*
the
thought
that
Hope
traversed
them
at
night
,
and
left
each
morning
*NL*
brighter
traces
of
her
steps
.
Flowers
peeped
out
amongst
the
leaves
;
*NL*
snow-drops
,
crocuses
,
purple
auriculas
,
and
golden-eyed
pansies
.
On
*NL*
Thursday
afternoons
-LRB-
half-holidays
-RRB-
we
now
took
walks
,
and
found
still
*NL*
sweeter
flowers
opening
by
the
wayside
,
under
the
hedges
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
discovered
,
too
,
that
a
great
pleasure
,
an
enjoyment
which
the
horizon
*NL*
only
bounded
,
lay
all
outside
the
high
and
spike-guarded
walls
of
our
*NL*
garden
:
this
pleasure
consisted
in
prospect
of
noble
summits
girdling
a
*NL*
great
hill-hollow
,
rich
in
verdure
and
shadow
;
in
a
bright
beck
,
full
of
*NL*
dark
stones
and
sparkling
eddies
.
How
different
had
this
scene
looked
*NL*
when
I
viewed
it
laid
out
beneath
the
iron
sky
of
winter
,
stiffened
in
*NL*
frost
,
shrouded
with
snow
!
--
when
mists
as
chill
as
death
wandered
to
the
*NL*
impulse
of
east
winds
along
those
purple
peaks
,
and
rolled
down
``
ing
''
and
*NL*
holm
till
they
blended
with
the
frozen
fog
of
the
beck
!
That
beck
itself
*NL*
was
then
a
torrent
,
turbid
and
curbless
:
it
tore
asunder
the
wood
,
and
*NL*
sent
a
raving
sound
through
the
air
,
often
thickened
with
wild
rain
or
*NL*
whirling
sleet
;
and
for
the
forest
on
its
banks
,
_
that
_
showed
only
ranks
*NL*
of
skeletons
.
*NL*
*NL*
April
advanced
to
May
:
a
bright
serene
May
it
was
;
days
of
blue
sky
,
*NL*
placid
sunshine
,
and
soft
western
or
southern
gales
filled
up
its
*NL*
duration
.
And
now
vegetation
matured
with
vigour
;
Lowood
shook
loose
its
*NL*
tresses
;
it
became
all
green
,
all
flowery
;
its
great
elm
,
ash
,
and
oak
*NL*
skeletons
were
restored
to
majestic
life
;
woodland
plants
sprang
up
*NL*
profusely
in
its
recesses
;
unnumbered
varieties
of
moss
filled
its
*NL*
hollows
,
and
it
made
a
strange
ground-sunshine
out
of
the
wealth
of
its
*NL*
wild
primrose
plants
:
I
have
seen
their
pale
gold
gleam
in
overshadowed
*NL*
spots
like
scatterings
of
the
sweetest
lustre
.
All
this
I
enjoyed
often
*NL*
and
fully
,
free
,
unwatched
,
and
almost
alone
:
for
this
unwonted
liberty
*NL*
and
pleasure
there
was
a
cause
,
to
which
it
now
becomes
my
task
to
*NL*
advert
.
*NL*
*NL*
Have
I
not
described
a
pleasant
site
for
a
dwelling
,
when
I
speak
of
it
*NL*
as
bosomed
in
hill
and
wood
,
and
rising
from
the
verge
of
a
stream
?
*NL*
Assuredly
,
pleasant
enough
:
but
whether
healthy
or
not
is
another
*NL*
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
forest-dell
,
where
Lowood
lay
,
was
the
cradle
of
fog
and
fog-bred
*NL*
pestilence
;
which
,
quickening
with
the
quickening
spring
,
crept
into
the
*NL*
Orphan
Asylum
,
breathed
typhus
through
its
crowded
schoolroom
and
*NL*
dormitory
,
and
,
ere
May
arrived
,
transformed
the
seminary
into
an
*NL*
hospital
.
*NL*
*NL*
Semi-starvation
and
neglected
colds
had
predisposed
most
of
the
pupils
to
*NL*
receive
infection
:
forty-five
out
of
the
eighty
girls
lay
ill
at
one
*NL*
time
.
Classes
were
broken
up
,
rules
relaxed
.
The
few
who
continued
well
*NL*
were
allowed
almost
unlimited
license
;
because
the
medical
attendant
*NL*
insisted
on
the
necessity
of
frequent
exercise
to
keep
them
in
health
:
*NL*
and
had
it
been
otherwise
,
no
one
had
leisure
to
watch
or
restrain
them
.
*NL*
Miss
Temple
's
whole
attention
was
absorbed
by
the
patients
:
she
lived
in
*NL*
the
sick-room
,
never
quitting
it
except
to
snatch
a
few
hours
'
rest
at
*NL*
night
.
The
teachers
were
fully
occupied
with
packing
up
and
making
other
*NL*
necessary
preparations
for
the
departure
of
those
girls
who
were
*NL*
fortunate
enough
to
have
friends
and
relations
able
and
willing
to
remove
*NL*
them
from
the
seat
of
contagion
.
Many
,
already
smitten
,
went
home
only
*NL*
to
die
:
some
died
at
the
school
,
and
were
buried
quietly
and
quickly
,
the
*NL*
nature
of
the
malady
forbidding
delay
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
disease
had
thus
become
an
inhabitant
of
Lowood
,
and
death
its
*NL*
frequent
visitor
;
while
there
was
gloom
and
fear
within
its
walls
;
while
*NL*
its
rooms
and
passages
steamed
with
hospital
smells
,
the
drug
and
the
*NL*
pastille
striving
vainly
to
overcome
the
effluvia
of
mortality
,
that
*NL*
bright
May
shone
unclouded
over
the
bold
hills
and
beautiful
woodland
out
*NL*
of
doors
.
Its
garden
,
too
,
glowed
with
flowers
:
hollyhocks
had
sprung
up
*NL*
tall
as
trees
,
lilies
had
opened
,
tulips
and
roses
were
in
bloom
;
the
*NL*
borders
of
the
little
beds
were
gay
with
pink
thrift
and
crimson
double
*NL*
daisies
;
the
sweetbriars
gave
out
,
morning
and
evening
,
their
scent
of
*NL*
spice
and
apples
;
and
these
fragrant
treasures
were
all
useless
for
most
*NL*
of
the
inmates
of
Lowood
,
except
to
furnish
now
and
then
a
handful
of
*NL*
herbs
and
blossoms
to
put
in
a
coffin
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
,
and
the
rest
who
continued
well
,
enjoyed
fully
the
beauties
of
the
*NL*
scene
and
season
;
they
let
us
ramble
in
the
wood
,
like
gipsies
,
from
*NL*
morning
till
night
;
we
did
what
we
liked
,
went
where
we
liked
:
we
lived
*NL*
better
too
.
Mr.
Brocklehurst
and
his
family
never
came
near
Lowood
now
:
*NL*
household
matters
were
not
scrutinised
into
;
the
cross
housekeeper
was
*NL*
gone
,
driven
away
by
the
fear
of
infection
;
her
successor
,
who
had
been
*NL*
matron
at
the
Lowton
Dispensary
,
unused
to
the
ways
of
her
new
abode
,
*NL*
provided
with
comparative
liberality
.
Besides
,
there
were
fewer
to
feed
;
*NL*
the
sick
could
eat
little
;
our
breakfast-basins
were
better
filled
;
when
*NL*
there
was
no
time
to
prepare
a
regular
dinner
,
which
often
happened
,
she
*NL*
would
give
us
a
large
piece
of
cold
pie
,
or
a
thick
slice
of
bread
and
*NL*
cheese
,
and
this
we
carried
away
with
us
to
the
wood
,
where
we
each
chose
*NL*
the
spot
we
liked
best
,
and
dined
sumptuously
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
favourite
seat
was
a
smooth
and
broad
stone
,
rising
white
and
dry
from
*NL*
the
very
middle
of
the
beck
,
and
only
to
be
got
at
by
wading
through
the
*NL*
water
;
a
feat
I
accomplished
barefoot
.
The
stone
was
just
broad
enough
*NL*
to
accommodate
,
comfortably
,
another
girl
and
me
,
at
that
time
my
chosen
*NL*
comrade
--
one
Mary
Ann
Wilson
;
a
shrewd
,
observant
personage
,
whose
*NL*
society
I
took
pleasure
in
,
partly
because
she
was
witty
and
original
,
*NL*
and
partly
because
she
had
a
manner
which
set
me
at
my
ease
.
Some
years
*NL*
older
than
I
,
she
knew
more
of
the
world
,
and
could
tell
me
many
things
I
*NL*
liked
to
hear
:
with
her
my
curiosity
found
gratification
:
to
my
faults
*NL*
also
she
gave
ample
indulgence
,
never
imposing
curb
or
rein
on
anything
I
*NL*
said
.
She
had
a
turn
for
narrative
,
I
for
analysis
;
she
liked
to
inform
,
*NL*
I
to
question
;
so
we
got
on
swimmingly
together
,
deriving
much
*NL*
entertainment
,
if
not
much
improvement
,
from
our
mutual
intercourse
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
where
,
meantime
,
was
Helen
Burns
?
Why
did
I
not
spend
these
sweet
*NL*
days
of
liberty
with
her
?
Had
I
forgotten
her
?
or
was
I
so
worthless
as
*NL*
to
have
grown
tired
of
her
pure
society
?
Surely
the
Mary
Ann
Wilson
I
*NL*
have
mentioned
was
inferior
to
my
first
acquaintance
:
she
could
only
tell
*NL*
me
amusing
stories
,
and
reciprocate
any
racy
and
pungent
gossip
I
chose
*NL*
to
indulge
in
;
while
,
if
I
have
spoken
truth
of
Helen
,
she
was
qualified
*NL*
to
give
those
who
enjoyed
the
privilege
of
her
converse
a
taste
of
far
*NL*
higher
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
True
,
reader
;
and
I
knew
and
felt
this
:
and
though
I
am
a
defective
*NL*
being
,
with
many
faults
and
few
redeeming
points
,
yet
I
never
tired
of
*NL*
Helen
Burns
;
nor
ever
ceased
to
cherish
for
her
a
sentiment
of
*NL*
attachment
,
as
strong
,
tender
,
and
respectful
as
any
that
ever
animated
*NL*
my
heart
.
How
could
it
be
otherwise
,
when
Helen
,
at
all
times
and
under
*NL*
all
circumstances
,
evinced
for
me
a
quiet
and
faithful
friendship
,
which
*NL*
ill-humour
never
soured
,
nor
irritation
never
troubled
?
But
Helen
was
*NL*
ill
at
present
:
for
some
weeks
she
had
been
removed
from
my
sight
to
I
*NL*
knew
not
what
room
upstairs
.
She
was
not
,
I
was
told
,
in
the
hospital
*NL*
portion
of
the
house
with
the
fever
patients
;
for
her
complaint
was
*NL*
consumption
,
not
typhus
:
and
by
consumption
I
,
in
my
ignorance
,
*NL*
understood
something
mild
,
which
time
and
care
would
be
sure
to
*NL*
alleviate
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
confirmed
in
this
idea
by
the
fact
of
her
once
or
twice
coming
*NL*
downstairs
on
very
warm
sunny
afternoons
,
and
being
taken
by
Miss
Temple
*NL*
into
the
garden
;
but
,
on
these
occasions
,
I
was
not
allowed
to
go
and
*NL*
speak
to
her
;
I
only
saw
her
from
the
schoolroom
window
,
and
then
not
*NL*
distinctly
;
for
she
was
much
wrapped
up
,
and
sat
at
a
distance
under
the
*NL*
verandah
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
,
in
the
beginning
of
June
,
I
had
stayed
out
very
late
with
*NL*
Mary
Ann
in
the
wood
;
we
had
,
as
usual
,
separated
ourselves
from
the
*NL*
others
,
and
had
wandered
far
;
so
far
that
we
lost
our
way
,
and
had
to
ask
*NL*
it
at
a
lonely
cottage
,
where
a
man
and
woman
lived
,
who
looked
after
a
*NL*
herd
of
half-wild
swine
that
fed
on
the
mast
in
the
wood
.
When
we
got
*NL*
back
,
it
was
after
moonrise
:
a
pony
,
which
we
knew
to
be
the
surgeon
's
,
*NL*
was
standing
at
the
garden
door
.
Mary
Ann
remarked
that
she
supposed
*NL*
some
one
must
be
very
ill
,
as
Mr.
Bates
had
been
sent
for
at
that
time
of
*NL*
the
evening
.
She
went
into
the
house
;
I
stayed
behind
a
few
minutes
to
*NL*
plant
in
my
garden
a
handful
of
roots
I
had
dug
up
in
the
forest
,
and
*NL*
which
I
feared
would
wither
if
I
left
them
till
the
morning
.
This
done
,
*NL*
I
lingered
yet
a
little
longer
:
the
flowers
smelt
so
sweet
as
the
dew
*NL*
fell
;
it
was
such
a
pleasant
evening
,
so
serene
,
so
warm
;
the
still
*NL*
glowing
west
promised
so
fairly
another
fine
day
on
the
morrow
;
the
moon
*NL*
rose
with
such
majesty
in
the
grave
east
.
I
was
noting
these
things
and
*NL*
enjoying
them
as
a
child
might
,
when
it
entered
my
mind
as
it
had
never
*NL*
done
before
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
sad
to
be
lying
now
on
a
sick
bed
,
and
to
be
in
danger
of
dying
!
*NL*
This
world
is
pleasant
--
it
would
be
dreary
to
be
called
from
it
,
and
to
*NL*
have
to
go
who
knows
where
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
my
mind
made
its
first
earnest
effort
to
comprehend
what
had
*NL*
been
infused
into
it
concerning
heaven
and
hell
;
and
for
the
first
time
*NL*
it
recoiled
,
baffled
;
and
for
the
first
time
glancing
behind
,
on
each
*NL*
side
,
and
before
it
,
it
saw
all
round
an
unfathomed
gulf
:
it
felt
the
one
*NL*
point
where
it
stood
--
the
present
;
all
the
rest
was
formless
cloud
and
*NL*
vacant
depth
;
and
it
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
tottering
,
and
plunging
*NL*
amid
that
chaos
.
While
pondering
this
new
idea
,
I
heard
the
front
door
*NL*
open
;
Mr.
Bates
came
out
,
and
with
him
was
a
nurse
.
After
she
had
seen
*NL*
him
mount
his
horse
and
depart
,
she
was
about
to
close
the
door
,
but
I
*NL*
ran
up
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
Helen
Burns
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
poorly
,
''
was
the
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
her
Mr.
Bates
has
been
to
see
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
does
he
say
about
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
says
she
'll
not
be
here
long
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
phrase
,
uttered
in
my
hearing
yesterday
,
would
have
only
conveyed
*NL*
the
notion
that
she
was
about
to
be
removed
to
Northumberland
,
to
her
own
*NL*
home
.
I
should
not
have
suspected
that
it
meant
she
was
dying
;
but
I
*NL*
knew
instantly
now
!
It
opened
clear
on
my
comprehension
that
Helen
Burns
*NL*
was
numbering
her
last
days
in
this
world
,
and
that
she
was
going
to
be
*NL*
taken
to
the
region
of
spirits
,
if
such
region
there
were
.
I
experienced
*NL*
a
shock
of
horror
,
then
a
strong
thrill
of
grief
,
then
a
desire
--
a
*NL*
necessity
to
see
her
;
and
I
asked
in
what
room
she
lay
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
in
Miss
Temple
's
room
,
''
said
the
nurse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
go
up
and
speak
to
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
child
!
It
is
not
likely
;
and
now
it
is
time
for
you
to
come
in
;
*NL*
you
'll
catch
the
fever
if
you
stop
out
when
the
dew
is
falling
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
nurse
closed
the
front
door
;
I
went
in
by
the
side
entrance
which
led
*NL*
to
the
schoolroom
:
I
was
just
in
time
;
it
was
nine
o'clock
,
and
Miss
*NL*
Miller
was
calling
the
pupils
to
go
to
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
might
be
two
hours
later
,
probably
near
eleven
,
when
I
--
not
having
*NL*
been
able
to
fall
asleep
,
and
deeming
,
from
the
perfect
silence
of
the
*NL*
dormitory
,
that
my
companions
were
all
wrapt
in
profound
repose
--
rose
*NL*
softly
,
put
on
my
frock
over
my
night-dress
,
and
,
without
shoes
,
crept
*NL*
from
the
apartment
,
and
set
off
in
quest
of
Miss
Temple
's
room
.
It
was
*NL*
quite
at
the
other
end
of
the
house
;
but
I
knew
my
way
;
and
the
light
of
*NL*
the
unclouded
summer
moon
,
entering
here
and
there
at
passage
windows
,
*NL*
enabled
me
to
find
it
without
difficulty
.
An
odour
of
camphor
and
burnt
*NL*
vinegar
warned
me
when
I
came
near
the
fever
room
:
and
I
passed
its
door
*NL*
quickly
,
fearful
lest
the
nurse
who
sat
up
all
night
should
hear
me
.
I
*NL*
dreaded
being
discovered
and
sent
back
;
for
I
_
must
_
see
Helen
,
--
I
must
*NL*
embrace
her
before
she
died
,
--
I
must
give
her
one
last
kiss
,
exchange
*NL*
with
her
one
last
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
descended
a
staircase
,
traversed
a
portion
of
the
house
below
,
and
*NL*
succeeded
in
opening
and
shutting
,
without
noise
,
two
doors
,
I
reached
*NL*
another
flight
of
steps
;
these
I
mounted
,
and
then
just
opposite
to
me
*NL*
was
Miss
Temple
's
room
.
A
light
shone
through
the
keyhole
and
from
under
*NL*
the
door
;
a
profound
stillness
pervaded
the
vicinity
.
Coming
near
,
I
*NL*
found
the
door
slightly
ajar
;
probably
to
admit
some
fresh
air
into
the
*NL*
close
abode
of
sickness
.
Indisposed
to
hesitate
,
and
full
of
impatient
*NL*
impulses
--
soul
and
senses
quivering
with
keen
throes
--
I
put
it
back
and
*NL*
looked
in
.
My
eye
sought
Helen
,
and
feared
to
find
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
Close
by
Miss
Temple
's
bed
,
and
half
covered
with
its
white
curtains
,
*NL*
there
stood
a
little
crib
.
I
saw
the
outline
of
a
form
under
the
*NL*
clothes
,
but
the
face
was
hid
by
the
hangings
:
the
nurse
I
had
spoken
to
*NL*
in
the
garden
sat
in
an
easy-chair
asleep
;
an
unsnuffed
candle
burnt
*NL*
dimly
on
the
table
.
Miss
Temple
was
not
to
be
seen
:
I
knew
afterwards
*NL*
that
she
had
been
called
to
a
delirious
patient
in
the
fever-room
.
I
*NL*
advanced
;
then
paused
by
the
crib
side
:
my
hand
was
on
the
curtain
,
but
I
*NL*
preferred
speaking
before
I
withdrew
it
.
I
still
recoiled
at
the
dread
*NL*
of
seeing
a
corpse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Helen
!
''
I
whispered
softly
,
``
are
you
awake
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
stirred
herself
,
put
back
the
curtain
,
and
I
saw
her
face
,
pale
,
*NL*
wasted
,
but
quite
composed
:
she
looked
so
little
changed
that
my
fear
was
*NL*
instantly
dissipated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
it
be
you
,
Jane
?
''
she
asked
,
in
her
own
gentle
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
I
thought
,
``
she
is
not
going
to
die
;
they
are
mistaken
:
she
could
*NL*
not
speak
and
look
so
calmly
if
she
were
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
got
on
to
her
crib
and
kissed
her
:
her
forehead
was
cold
,
and
her
cheek
*NL*
both
cold
and
thin
,
and
so
were
her
hand
and
wrist
;
but
she
smiled
as
of
*NL*
old
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
are
you
come
here
,
Jane
?
It
is
past
eleven
o'clock
:
I
heard
it
*NL*
strike
some
minutes
since
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
came
to
see
you
,
Helen
:
I
heard
you
were
very
ill
,
and
I
could
not
*NL*
sleep
till
I
had
spoken
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
came
to
bid
me
good-bye
,
then
:
you
are
just
in
time
probably
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
going
somewhere
,
Helen
?
Are
you
going
home
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
to
my
long
home
--
my
last
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
Helen
!
''
I
stopped
,
distressed
.
While
I
tried
to
devour
my
*NL*
tears
,
a
fit
of
coughing
seized
Helen
;
it
did
not
,
however
,
wake
the
*NL*
nurse
;
when
it
was
over
,
she
lay
some
minutes
exhausted
;
then
she
*NL*
whispered
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jane
,
your
little
feet
are
bare
;
lie
down
and
cover
yourself
with
my
*NL*
quilt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
so
:
she
put
her
arm
over
me
,
and
I
nestled
close
to
her
.
After
a
*NL*
long
silence
,
she
resumed
,
still
whispering
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
happy
,
Jane
;
and
when
you
hear
that
I
am
dead
,
you
must
be
*NL*
sure
and
not
grieve
:
there
is
nothing
to
grieve
about
.
We
all
must
die
*NL*
one
day
,
and
the
illness
which
is
removing
me
is
not
painful
;
it
is
*NL*
gentle
and
gradual
:
my
mind
is
at
rest
.
I
leave
no
one
to
regret
me
*NL*
much
:
I
have
only
a
father
;
and
he
is
lately
married
,
and
will
not
miss
*NL*
me
.
By
dying
young
,
I
shall
escape
great
sufferings
.
I
had
not
*NL*
qualities
or
talents
to
make
my
way
very
well
in
the
world
:
I
should
have
*NL*
been
continually
at
fault
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
where
are
you
going
to
,
Helen
?
Can
you
see
?
Do
you
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
;
I
have
faith
:
I
am
going
to
God
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
God
?
What
is
God
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
Maker
and
yours
,
who
will
never
destroy
what
He
created
.
I
rely
*NL*
implicitly
on
His
power
,
and
confide
wholly
in
His
goodness
:
I
count
the
*NL*
hours
till
that
eventful
one
arrives
which
shall
restore
me
to
Him
,
*NL*
reveal
Him
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
sure
,
then
,
Helen
,
that
there
is
such
a
place
as
heaven
,
and
*NL*
that
our
souls
can
get
to
it
when
we
die
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
there
is
a
future
state
;
I
believe
God
is
good
;
I
can
resign
*NL*
my
immortal
part
to
Him
without
any
misgiving
.
God
is
my
father
;
God
is
*NL*
my
friend
:
I
love
Him
;
I
believe
He
loves
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
shall
I
see
you
again
,
Helen
,
when
I
die
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
come
to
the
same
region
of
happiness
:
be
received
by
the
same
*NL*
mighty
,
universal
Parent
,
no
doubt
,
dear
Jane
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
I
questioned
,
but
this
time
only
in
thought
.
``
Where
is
that
*NL*
region
?
Does
it
exist
?
''
And
I
clasped
my
arms
closer
round
Helen
;
she
*NL*
seemed
dearer
to
me
than
ever
;
I
felt
as
if
I
could
not
let
her
go
;
I
lay
*NL*
with
my
face
hidden
on
her
neck
.
Presently
she
said
,
in
the
sweetest
*NL*
tone
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
comfortable
I
am
!
That
last
fit
of
coughing
has
tired
me
a
little
;
*NL*
I
feel
as
if
I
could
sleep
:
but
do
n't
leave
me
,
Jane
;
I
like
to
have
you
*NL*
near
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
stay
with
you
,
_
dear
_
Helen
:
no
one
shall
take
me
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
warm
,
darling
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-night
,
Jane
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-night
,
Helen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
kissed
me
,
and
I
her
,
and
we
both
soon
slumbered
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
awoke
it
was
day
:
an
unusual
movement
roused
me
;
I
looked
up
;
I
*NL*
was
in
somebody
's
arms
;
the
nurse
held
me
;
she
was
carrying
me
through
*NL*
the
passage
back
to
the
dormitory
.
I
was
not
reprimanded
for
leaving
my
*NL*
bed
;
people
had
something
else
to
think
about
;
no
explanation
was
*NL*
afforded
then
to
my
many
questions
;
but
a
day
or
two
afterwards
I
learned
*NL*
that
Miss
Temple
,
on
returning
to
her
own
room
at
dawn
,
had
found
me
laid
*NL*
in
the
little
crib
;
my
face
against
Helen
Burns
's
shoulder
,
my
arms
round
*NL*
her
neck
.
I
was
asleep
,
and
Helen
was
--
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
grave
is
in
Brocklebridge
churchyard
:
for
fifteen
years
after
her
*NL*
death
it
was
only
covered
by
a
grassy
mound
;
but
now
a
grey
marble
tablet
*NL*
marks
the
spot
,
inscribed
with
her
name
,
and
the
word
``
Resurgam
.
''
*NL*

CHAPTER
X
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Hitherto
I
have
recorded
in
detail
the
events
of
my
insignificant
*NL*
existence
:
to
the
first
ten
years
of
my
life
I
have
given
almost
as
many
*NL*
chapters
.
But
this
is
not
to
be
a
regular
autobiography
.
I
am
only
*NL*
bound
to
invoke
Memory
where
I
know
her
responses
will
possess
some
*NL*
degree
of
interest
;
therefore
I
now
pass
a
space
of
eight
years
almost
in
*NL*
silence
:
a
few
lines
only
are
necessary
to
keep
up
the
links
of
*NL*
connection
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
typhus
fever
had
fulfilled
its
mission
of
devastation
at
Lowood
,
*NL*
it
gradually
disappeared
from
thence
;
but
not
till
its
virulence
and
the
*NL*
number
of
its
victims
had
drawn
public
attention
on
the
school
.
Inquiry
*NL*
was
made
into
the
origin
of
the
scourge
,
and
by
degrees
various
facts
*NL*
came
out
which
excited
public
indignation
in
a
high
degree
.
The
*NL*
unhealthy
nature
of
the
site
;
the
quantity
and
quality
of
the
children
's
*NL*
food
;
the
brackish
,
fetid
water
used
in
its
preparation
;
the
pupils
'
*NL*
wretched
clothing
and
accommodations
--
all
these
things
were
discovered
,
*NL*
and
the
discovery
produced
a
result
mortifying
to
Mr.
Brocklehurst
,
but
*NL*
beneficial
to
the
institution
.
*NL*
*NL*
Several
wealthy
and
benevolent
individuals
in
the
county
subscribed
*NL*
largely
for
the
erection
of
a
more
convenient
building
in
a
better
*NL*
situation
;
new
regulations
were
made
;
improvements
in
diet
and
clothing
*NL*
introduced
;
the
funds
of
the
school
were
intrusted
to
the
management
of
a
*NL*
committee
.
Mr.
Brocklehurst
,
who
,
from
his
wealth
and
family
*NL*
connections
,
could
not
be
overlooked
,
still
retained
the
post
of
*NL*
treasurer
;
but
he
was
aided
in
the
discharge
of
his
duties
by
gentlemen
*NL*
of
rather
more
enlarged
and
sympathising
minds
:
his
office
of
inspector
,
*NL*
too
,
was
shared
by
those
who
knew
how
to
combine
reason
with
strictness
,
*NL*
comfort
with
economy
,
compassion
with
uprightness
.
The
school
,
thus
*NL*
improved
,
became
in
time
a
truly
useful
and
noble
institution
.
I
*NL*
remained
an
inmate
of
its
walls
,
after
its
regeneration
,
for
eight
years
:
*NL*
six
as
pupil
,
and
two
as
teacher
;
and
in
both
capacities
I
bear
my
*NL*
testimony
to
its
value
and
importance
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
these
eight
years
my
life
was
uniform
:
but
not
unhappy
,
because
it
*NL*
was
not
inactive
.
I
had
the
means
of
an
excellent
education
placed
*NL*
within
my
reach
;
a
fondness
for
some
of
my
studies
,
and
a
desire
to
excel
*NL*
in
all
,
together
with
a
great
delight
in
pleasing
my
teachers
,
especially
*NL*
such
as
I
loved
,
urged
me
on
:
I
availed
myself
fully
of
the
advantages
*NL*
offered
me
.
In
time
I
rose
to
be
the
first
girl
of
the
first
class
;
then
*NL*
I
was
invested
with
the
office
of
teacher
;
which
I
discharged
with
zeal
*NL*
for
two
years
:
but
at
the
end
of
that
time
I
altered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Temple
,
through
all
changes
,
had
thus
far
continued
superintendent
*NL*
of
the
seminary
:
to
her
instruction
I
owed
the
best
part
of
my
*NL*
acquirements
;
her
friendship
and
society
had
been
my
continual
solace
;
*NL*
she
had
stood
me
in
the
stead
of
mother
,
governess
,
and
,
latterly
,
*NL*
companion
.
At
this
period
she
married
,
removed
with
her
husband
-LRB-
a
*NL*
clergyman
,
an
excellent
man
,
almost
worthy
of
such
a
wife
-RRB-
to
a
distant
*NL*
county
,
and
consequently
was
lost
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
day
she
left
I
was
no
longer
the
same
:
with
her
was
gone
every
*NL*
settled
feeling
,
every
association
that
had
made
Lowood
in
some
degree
a
*NL*
home
to
me
.
I
had
imbibed
from
her
something
of
her
nature
and
much
of
*NL*
her
habits
:
more
harmonious
thoughts
:
what
seemed
better
regulated
*NL*
feelings
had
become
the
inmates
of
my
mind
.
I
had
given
in
allegiance
to
*NL*
duty
and
order
;
I
was
quiet
;
I
believed
I
was
content
:
to
the
eyes
of
*NL*
others
,
usually
even
to
my
own
,
I
appeared
a
disciplined
and
subdued
*NL*
character
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
destiny
,
in
the
shape
of
the
Rev.
Mr.
Nasmyth
,
came
between
me
and
*NL*
Miss
Temple
:
I
saw
her
in
her
travelling
dress
step
into
a
post-chaise
,
*NL*
shortly
after
the
marriage
ceremony
;
I
watched
the
chaise
mount
the
hill
*NL*
and
disappear
beyond
its
brow
;
and
then
retired
to
my
own
room
,
and
there
*NL*
spent
in
solitude
the
greatest
part
of
the
half-holiday
granted
in
honour
*NL*
of
the
occasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
walked
about
the
chamber
most
of
the
time
.
I
imagined
myself
only
to
*NL*
be
regretting
my
loss
,
and
thinking
how
to
repair
it
;
but
when
my
*NL*
reflections
were
concluded
,
and
I
looked
up
and
found
that
the
afternoon
*NL*
was
gone
,
and
evening
far
advanced
,
another
discovery
dawned
on
me
,
*NL*
namely
,
that
in
the
interval
I
had
undergone
a
transforming
process
;
that
*NL*
my
mind
had
put
off
all
it
had
borrowed
of
Miss
Temple
--
or
rather
that
*NL*
she
had
taken
with
her
the
serene
atmosphere
I
had
been
breathing
in
her
*NL*
vicinity
--
and
that
now
I
was
left
in
my
natural
element
,
and
beginning
to
*NL*
feel
the
stirring
of
old
emotions
.
It
did
not
seem
as
if
a
prop
were
*NL*
withdrawn
,
but
rather
as
if
a
motive
were
gone
:
it
was
not
the
power
to
*NL*
be
tranquil
which
had
failed
me
,
but
the
reason
for
tranquillity
was
no
*NL*
more
.
My
world
had
for
some
years
been
in
Lowood
:
my
experience
had
been
*NL*
of
its
rules
and
systems
;
now
I
remembered
that
the
real
world
was
wide
,
*NL*
and
that
a
varied
field
of
hopes
and
fears
,
of
sensations
and
*NL*
excitements
,
awaited
those
who
had
courage
to
go
forth
into
its
expanse
,
*NL*
to
seek
real
knowledge
of
life
amidst
its
perils
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
to
my
window
,
opened
it
,
and
looked
out
.
There
were
the
two
wings
*NL*
of
the
building
;
there
was
the
garden
;
there
were
the
skirts
of
Lowood
;
*NL*
there
was
the
hilly
horizon
.
My
eye
passed
all
other
objects
to
rest
on
*NL*
those
most
remote
,
the
blue
peaks
;
it
was
those
I
longed
to
surmount
;
all
*NL*
within
their
boundary
of
rock
and
heath
seemed
prison-ground
,
exile
*NL*
limits
.
I
traced
the
white
road
winding
round
the
base
of
one
mountain
,
*NL*
and
vanishing
in
a
gorge
between
two
;
how
I
longed
to
follow
it
farther
!
*NL*
I
recalled
the
time
when
I
had
travelled
that
very
road
in
a
coach
;
I
*NL*
remembered
descending
that
hill
at
twilight
;
an
age
seemed
to
have
*NL*
elapsed
since
the
day
which
brought
me
first
to
Lowood
,
and
I
had
never
*NL*
quitted
it
since
.
My
vacations
had
all
been
spent
at
school
:
Mrs.
Reed
*NL*
had
never
sent
for
me
to
Gateshead
;
neither
she
nor
any
of
her
family
had
*NL*
ever
been
to
visit
me
.
I
had
had
no
communication
by
letter
or
message
*NL*
with
the
outer
world
:
school-rules
,
school-duties
,
school-habits
and
*NL*
notions
,
and
voices
,
and
faces
,
and
phrases
,
and
costumes
,
and
*NL*
preferences
,
and
antipathies
--
such
was
what
I
knew
of
existence
.
And
now
*NL*
I
felt
that
it
was
not
enough
;
I
tired
of
the
routine
of
eight
years
in
*NL*
one
afternoon
.
I
desired
liberty
;
for
liberty
I
gasped
;
for
liberty
I
*NL*
uttered
a
prayer
;
it
seemed
scattered
on
the
wind
then
faintly
blowing
.
I
*NL*
abandoned
it
and
framed
a
humbler
supplication
;
for
change
,
stimulus
:
*NL*
that
petition
,
too
,
seemed
swept
off
into
vague
space
:
``
Then
,
''
I
cried
,
*NL*
half
desperate
,
``
grant
me
at
least
a
new
servitude
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
a
bell
,
ringing
the
hour
of
supper
,
called
me
downstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
not
free
to
resume
the
interrupted
chain
of
my
reflections
till
*NL*
bedtime
:
even
then
a
teacher
who
occupied
the
same
room
with
me
kept
me
*NL*
from
the
subject
to
which
I
longed
to
recur
,
by
a
prolonged
effusion
of
*NL*
small
talk
.
How
I
wished
sleep
would
silence
her
.
It
seemed
as
if
,
*NL*
could
I
but
go
back
to
the
idea
which
had
last
entered
my
mind
as
I
stood
*NL*
at
the
window
,
some
inventive
suggestion
would
rise
for
my
relief
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Gryce
snored
at
last
;
she
was
a
heavy
Welshwoman
,
and
till
now
her
*NL*
habitual
nasal
strains
had
never
been
regarded
by
me
in
any
other
light
*NL*
than
as
a
nuisance
;
to-night
I
hailed
the
first
deep
notes
with
*NL*
satisfaction
;
I
was
debarrassed
of
interruption
;
my
half-effaced
thought
*NL*
instantly
revived
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
new
servitude
!
There
is
something
in
that
,
''
I
soliloquised
-LRB-
mentally
,
*NL*
be
it
understood
;
I
did
not
talk
aloud
-RRB-
,
``
I
know
there
is
,
because
it
*NL*
does
not
sound
too
sweet
;
it
is
not
like
such
words
as
Liberty
,
*NL*
Excitement
,
Enjoyment
:
delightful
sounds
truly
;
but
no
more
than
sounds
*NL*
for
me
;
and
so
hollow
and
fleeting
that
it
is
mere
waste
of
time
to
*NL*
listen
to
them
.
But
Servitude
!
That
must
be
matter
of
fact
.
Any
one
*NL*
may
serve
:
I
have
served
here
eight
years
;
now
all
I
want
is
to
serve
*NL*
elsewhere
.
Can
I
not
get
so
much
of
my
own
will
?
Is
not
the
thing
*NL*
feasible
?
Yes
--
yes
--
the
end
is
not
so
difficult
;
if
I
had
only
a
brain
*NL*
active
enough
to
ferret
out
the
means
of
attaining
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
sat
up
in
bed
by
way
of
arousing
this
said
brain
:
it
was
a
chilly
*NL*
night
;
I
covered
my
shoulders
with
a
shawl
,
and
then
I
proceeded
_
to
*NL*
think
_
again
with
all
my
might
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
I
want
?
A
new
place
,
in
a
new
house
,
amongst
new
faces
,
under
*NL*
new
circumstances
:
I
want
this
because
it
is
of
no
use
wanting
anything
*NL*
better
.
How
do
people
do
to
get
a
new
place
?
They
apply
to
friends
,
I
*NL*
suppose
:
I
have
no
friends
.
There
are
many
others
who
have
no
friends
,
*NL*
who
must
look
about
for
themselves
and
be
their
own
helpers
;
and
what
is
*NL*
their
resource
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
tell
:
nothing
answered
me
;
I
then
ordered
my
brain
to
find
a
*NL*
response
,
and
quickly
.
It
worked
and
worked
faster
:
I
felt
the
pulses
*NL*
throb
in
my
head
and
temples
;
but
for
nearly
an
hour
it
worked
in
chaos
;
*NL*
and
no
result
came
of
its
efforts
.
Feverish
with
vain
labour
,
I
got
up
*NL*
and
took
a
turn
in
the
room
;
undrew
the
curtain
,
noted
a
star
or
two
,
*NL*
shivered
with
cold
,
and
again
crept
to
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
kind
fairy
,
in
my
absence
,
had
surely
dropped
the
required
suggestion
*NL*
on
my
pillow
;
for
as
I
lay
down
,
it
came
quietly
and
naturally
to
my
*NL*
mind
.
--
``
Those
who
want
situations
advertise
;
you
must
advertise
in
the
*NL*
_
--
shire
Herald
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
?
I
know
nothing
about
advertising
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Replies
rose
smooth
and
prompt
now
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
enclose
the
advertisement
and
the
money
to
pay
for
it
under
a
*NL*
cover
directed
to
the
editor
of
the
_
Herald
_
;
you
must
put
it
,
the
first
*NL*
opportunity
you
have
,
into
the
post
at
Lowton
;
answers
must
be
addressed
*NL*
to
J.E.
,
at
the
post-office
there
;
you
can
go
and
inquire
in
about
a
week
*NL*
after
you
send
your
letter
,
if
any
are
come
,
and
act
accordingly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
scheme
I
went
over
twice
,
thrice
;
it
was
then
digested
in
my
mind
;
I
*NL*
had
it
in
a
clear
practical
form
:
I
felt
satisfied
,
and
fell
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
earliest
day
,
I
was
up
:
I
had
my
advertisement
written
,
enclosed
,
*NL*
and
directed
before
the
bell
rang
to
rouse
the
school
;
it
ran
thus
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
young
lady
accustomed
to
tuition
''
-LRB-
had
I
not
been
a
teacher
two
*NL*
years
?
-RRB-
``
is
desirous
of
meeting
with
a
situation
in
a
private
family
*NL*
where
the
children
are
under
fourteen
''
-LRB-
I
thought
that
as
I
was
barely
*NL*
eighteen
,
it
would
not
do
to
undertake
the
guidance
of
pupils
nearer
my
*NL*
own
age
-RRB-
.
``
She
is
qualified
to
teach
the
usual
branches
of
a
good
English
*NL*
education
,
together
with
French
,
Drawing
,
and
Music
''
-LRB-
in
those
days
,
*NL*
reader
,
this
now
narrow
catalogue
of
accomplishments
,
would
have
been
*NL*
held
tolerably
comprehensive
-RRB-
.
``
Address
,
J.E.
,

,
Lowton
,
--
*NL*
shire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
document
remained
locked
in
my
drawer
all
day
:
after
tea
,
I
asked
*NL*
leave
of
the
new
superintendent
to
go
to
Lowton
,
in
order
to
perform
some
*NL*
small
commissions
for
myself
and
one
or
two
of
my
fellow-teachers
;
*NL*
permission
was
readily
granted
;
I
went
.
It
was
a
walk
of
two
miles
,
and
*NL*
the
evening
was
wet
,
but
the
days
were
still
long
;
I
visited
a
shop
or
*NL*
two
,
slipped
the
letter
into
the
post-office
,
and
came
back
through
heavy
*NL*
rain
,
with
streaming
garments
,
but
with
a
relieved
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
succeeding
week
seemed
long
:
it
came
to
an
end
at
last
,
however
,
like
*NL*
all
sublunary
things
,
and
once
more
,
towards
the
close
of
a
pleasant
*NL*
autumn
day
,
I
found
myself
afoot
on
the
road
to
Lowton
.
A
picturesque
*NL*
track
it
was
,
by
the
way
;
lying
along
the
side
of
the
beck
and
through
*NL*
the
sweetest
curves
of
the
dale
:
but
that
day
I
thought
more
of
the
*NL*
letters
,
that
might
or
might
not
be
awaiting
me
at
the
little
burgh
*NL*
whither
I
was
bound
,
than
of
the
charms
of
lea
and
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
ostensible
errand
on
this
occasion
was
to
get
measured
for
a
pair
of
*NL*
shoes
;
so
I
discharged
that
business
first
,
and
when
it
was
done
,
I
*NL*
stepped
across
the
clean
and
quiet
little
street
from
the
shoemaker
's
to
*NL*
the
post-office
:
it
was
kept
by
an
old
dame
,
who
wore
horn
spectacles
on
*NL*
her
nose
,
and
black
mittens
on
her
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
there
any
letters
for
J.E.
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
peered
at
me
over
her
spectacles
,
and
then
she
opened
a
drawer
and
*NL*
fumbled
among
its
contents
for
a
long
time
,
so
long
that
my
hopes
began
*NL*
to
falter
.
At
last
,
having
held
a
document
before
her
glasses
for
nearly
*NL*
five
minutes
,
she
presented
it
across
the
counter
,
accompanying
the
act
*NL*
by
another
inquisitive
and
mistrustful
glance
--
it
was
for
J.E.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
only
one
?
''
I
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
no
more
,
''
said
she
;
and
I
put
it
in
my
pocket
and
turned
my
*NL*
face
homeward
:
I
could
not
open
it
then
;
rules
obliged
me
to
be
back
by
*NL*
eight
,
and
it
was
already
half-past
seven
.
*NL*
*NL*
Various
duties
awaited
me
on
my
arrival
.
I
had
to
sit
with
the
girls
*NL*
during
their
hour
of
study
;
then
it
was
my
turn
to
read
prayers
;
to
see
*NL*
them
to
bed
:
afterwards
I
supped
with
the
other
teachers
.
Even
when
we
*NL*
finally
retired
for
the
night
,
the
inevitable
Miss
Gryce
was
still
my
*NL*
companion
:
we
had
only
a
short
end
of
candle
in
our
candlestick
,
and
I
*NL*
dreaded
lest
she
should
talk
till
it
was
all
burnt
out
;
fortunately
,
*NL*
however
,
the
heavy
supper
she
had
eaten
produced
a
soporific
effect
:
she
*NL*
was
already
snoring
before
I
had
finished
undressing
.
There
still
*NL*
remained
an
inch
of
candle
:
I
now
took
out
my
letter
;
the
seal
was
an
*NL*
initial
F.
;
I
broke
it
;
the
contents
were
brief
.
*NL*
*NL*

--
shire
Herald
_
of
last
Thursday
,
*NL*
possesses
the
acquirements
mentioned
,
and
if
she
is
in
a
position
to
give
*NL*
satisfactory
references
as
to
character
and
competency
,
a
situation
can
*NL*
be
offered
her
where
there
is
but
one
pupil
,
a
little
girl
,
under
ten
*NL*
years
of
age
;
and
where
the
salary
is
thirty
pounds
per
annum
.
J.E.
is
*NL*
requested
to
send
references
,
name
,
address
,
and
all
particulars
to
the
*NL*
direction
:

*NL*
``
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
Thornfield
,
near
Millcote
,
--
shire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
examined
the
document
long
:
the
writing
was
old-fashioned
and
rather
*NL*
uncertain
,
like
that
of
an
elderly
lady
.
This
circumstance
was
*NL*
satisfactory
:
a
private
fear
had
haunted
me
,
that
in
thus
acting
for
*NL*
myself
,
and
by
my
own
guidance
,
I
ran
the
risk
of
getting
into
some
*NL*
scrape
;
and
,
above
all
things
,
I
wished
the
result
of
my
endeavours
to
be
*NL*
respectable
,
proper
,
_
en
regle
_
.
I
now
felt
that
an
elderly
lady
was
no
*NL*
bad
ingredient
in
the
business
I
had
on
hand
.
Mrs.
Fairfax
!
I
saw
her
*NL*
in
a
black
gown
and
widow
's
cap
;
frigid
,
perhaps
,
but
not
uncivil
:
a
*NL*
model
of
elderly
English
respectability
.
Thornfield
!
that
,
doubtless
,
*NL*
was
the
name
of
her
house
:
a
neat
orderly
spot
,
I
was
sure
;
though
I
*NL*
failed
in
my
efforts
to
conceive
a
correct
plan
of
the
premises
.
*NL*
Millcote
,
--
shire
;
I
brushed
up
my
recollections
of
the
map
of
England
,
*NL*
yes
,
I
saw
it
;
both
the
shire
and
the
town
.
--
shire
was
seventy
miles
*NL*
nearer
London
than
the
remote
county
where
I
now
resided
:
that
was
a
*NL*
recommendation
to
me
.
I
longed
to
go
where
there
was
life
and
movement
:
*NL*
Millcote
was
a
large
manufacturing
town
on
the
banks
of
the
A
-
;
a
busy
*NL*
place
enough
,
doubtless
:
so
much
the
better
;
it
would
be
a
complete
*NL*
change
at
least
.
Not
that
my
fancy
was
much
captivated
by
the
idea
of
*NL*
long
chimneys
and
clouds
of
smoke
--
``
but
,
''
I
argued
,
``
Thornfield
will
,
*NL*
probably
,
be
a
good
way
from
the
town
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
socket
of
the
candle
dropped
,
and
the
wick
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
new
steps
were
to
be
taken
;
my
plans
could
no
longer
be
confined
*NL*
to
my
own
breast
;
I
must
impart
them
in
order
to
achieve
their
success
.
*NL*
Having
sought
and
obtained
an
audience
of
the
superintendent
during
the
*NL*
noontide
recreation
,
I
told
her
I
had
a
prospect
of
getting
a
new
*NL*
situation
where
the
salary
would
be
double
what
I
now
received
-LRB-
for
at
*NL*
Lowood
I
only
got
15
pounds
per
annum
-RRB-
;
and
requested
she
would
break
the
*NL*
matter
for
me
to
Mr.
Brocklehurst
,
or
some
of
the
committee
,
and
*NL*
ascertain
whether
they
would
permit
me
to
mention
them
as
references
.
She
*NL*
obligingly
consented
to
act
as
mediatrix
in
the
matter
.
The
next
day
she
*NL*
laid
the
affair
before
Mr.
Brocklehurst
,
who
said
that
Mrs.
Reed
must
be
*NL*
written
to
,
as
she
was
my
natural
guardian
.
A
note
was
accordingly
*NL*
addressed
to
that
lady
,
who
returned
for
answer
,
that
``
I
might
do
as
I
*NL*
pleased
:
she
had
long
relinquished
all
interference
in
my
affairs
.
''
This
*NL*
note
went
the
round
of
the
committee
,
and
at
last
,
after
what
appeared
to
*NL*
me
most
tedious
delay
,
formal
leave
was
given
me
to
better
my
condition
*NL*
if
I
could
;
and
an
assurance
added
,
that
as
I
had
always
conducted
myself
*NL*
well
,
both
as
teacher
and
pupil
,
at
Lowood
,
a
testimonial
of
character
*NL*
and
capacity
,
signed
by
the
inspectors
of
that
institution
,
should
*NL*
forthwith
be
furnished
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
testimonial
I
accordingly
received
in
about
a
month
,
forwarded
a
*NL*
copy
of
it
to
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
and
got
that
lady
's
reply
,
stating
that
she
*NL*
was
satisfied
,
and
fixing
that
day
fortnight
as
the
period
for
my
*NL*
assuming
the
post
of
governess
in
her
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
now
busied
myself
in
preparations
:
the
fortnight
passed
rapidly
.
I
had
*NL*
not
a
very
large
wardrobe
,
though
it
was
adequate
to
my
wants
;
and
the
*NL*
last
day
sufficed
to
pack
my
trunk
,
--
the
same
I
had
brought
with
me
eight
*NL*
years
ago
from
Gateshead
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
box
was
corded
,
the
card
nailed
on
.
In
half-an-hour
the
carrier
was
*NL*
to
call
for
it
to
take
it
to
Lowton
,
whither
I
myself
was
to
repair
at
an
*NL*
early
hour
the
next
morning
to
meet
the
coach
.
I
had
brushed
my
black
*NL*
stuff
travelling-dress
,
prepared
my
bonnet
,
gloves
,
and
muff
;
sought
in
*NL*
all
my
drawers
to
see
that
no
article
was
left
behind
;
and
now
having
*NL*
nothing
more
to
do
,
I
sat
down
and
tried
to
rest
.
I
could
not
;
though
I
*NL*
had
been
on
foot
all
day
,
I
could
not
now
repose
an
instant
;
I
was
too
*NL*
much
excited
.
A
phase
of
my
life
was
closing
to-night
,
a
new
one
opening
*NL*
to-morrow
:
impossible
to
slumber
in
the
interval
;
I
must
watch
feverishly
*NL*
while
the
change
was
being
accomplished
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
,
''
said
a
servant
who
met
me
in
the
lobby
,
where
I
was
wandering
*NL*
like
a
troubled
spirit
,
``
a
person
below
wishes
to
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
carrier
,
no
doubt
,
''
I
thought
,
and
ran
downstairs
without
inquiry
.
I
*NL*
was
passing
the
back-parlour
or
teachers
'
sitting-room
,
the
door
of
which
*NL*
was
half
open
,
to
go
to
the
kitchen
,
when
some
one
ran
out
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
her
,
I
am
sure
!
--
I
could
have
told
her
anywhere
!
''
cried
the
*NL*
individual
who
stopped
my
progress
and
took
my
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
looked
:
I
saw
a
woman
attired
like
a
well-dressed
servant
,
matronly
,
*NL*
yet
still
young
;
very
good-looking
,
with
black
hair
and
eyes
,
and
lively
*NL*
complexion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
who
is
it
?
''
she
asked
,
in
a
voice
and
with
a
smile
I
half
*NL*
recognised
;
``
you
've
not
quite
forgotten
me
,
I
think
,
Miss
Jane
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
another
second
I
was
embracing
and
kissing
her
rapturously
:
``
Bessie
!
*NL*
Bessie
!
Bessie
!
''
that
was
all
I
said
;
whereat
she
half
laughed
,
half
*NL*
cried
,
and
we
both
went
into
the
parlour
.
By
the
fire
stood
a
little
*NL*
fellow
of
three
years
old
,
in
plaid
frock
and
trousers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
my
little
boy
,
''
said
Bessie
directly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
are
married
,
Bessie
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
nearly
five
years
since
to
Robert
Leaven
,
the
coachman
;
and
I
've
a
*NL*
little
girl
besides
Bobby
there
,
that
I
've
christened
Jane
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
do
n't
live
at
Gateshead
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
live
at
the
lodge
:
the
old
porter
has
left
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
how
do
they
all
get
on
?
Tell
me
everything
about
them
,
*NL*
Bessie
:
but
sit
down
first
;
and
,
Bobby
,
come
and
sit
on
my
knee
,
will
*NL*
you
?
''
but
Bobby
preferred
sidling
over
to
his
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
not
grown
so
very
tall
,
Miss
Jane
,
nor
so
very
stout
,
''
continued
*NL*
Mrs.
Leaven
.
``
I
dare
say
they
've
not
kept
you
too
well
at
school
:
Miss
*NL*
Reed
is
the
head
and
shoulders
taller
than
you
are
;
and
Miss
Georgiana
*NL*
would
make
two
of
you
in
breadth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Georgiana
is
handsome
,
I
suppose
,
Bessie
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
.
She
went
up
to
London
last
winter
with
her
mama
,
and
there
*NL*
everybody
admired
her
,
and
a
young
lord
fell
in
love
with
her
:
but
his
*NL*
relations
were
against
the
match
;
and
--
what
do
you
think
?
--
he
and
Miss
*NL*
Georgiana
made
it
up
to
run
away
;
but
they
were
found
out
and
stopped
.
It
*NL*
was
Miss
Reed
that
found
them
out
:
I
believe
she
was
envious
;
and
now
she
*NL*
and
her
sister
lead
a
cat
and
dog
life
together
;
they
are
always
*NL*
quarrelling
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
what
of
John
Reed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
he
is
not
doing
so
well
as
his
mama
could
wish
.
He
went
to
college
,
*NL*
and
he
got
--
plucked
,
I
think
they
call
it
:
and
then
his
uncles
wanted
him
*NL*
to
be
a
barrister
,
and
study
the
law
:
but
he
is
such
a
dissipated
young
*NL*
man
,
they
will
never
make
much
of
him
,
I
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
he
look
like
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
very
tall
:
some
people
call
him
a
fine-looking
young
man
;
but
he
*NL*
has
such
thick
lips
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Mrs.
Reed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Missis
looks
stout
and
well
enough
in
the
face
,
but
I
think
she
's
not
*NL*
quite
easy
in
her
mind
:
Mr.
John
's
conduct
does
not
please
her
--
he
spends
*NL*
a
deal
of
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
she
send
you
here
,
Bessie
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
indeed
:
but
I
have
long
wanted
to
see
you
,
and
when
I
heard
that
*NL*
there
had
been
a
letter
from
you
,
and
that
you
were
going
to
another
part
*NL*
of
the
country
,
I
thought
I
'd
just
set
off
,
and
get
a
look
at
you
before
*NL*
you
were
quite
out
of
my
reach
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
you
are
disappointed
in
me
,
Bessie
.
''
I
said
this
laughing
:
*NL*
I
perceived
that
Bessie
's
glance
,
though
it
expressed
regard
,
did
in
no
*NL*
shape
denote
admiration
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Miss
Jane
,
not
exactly
:
you
are
genteel
enough
;
you
look
like
a
*NL*
lady
,
and
it
is
as
much
as
ever
I
expected
of
you
:
you
were
no
beauty
as
*NL*
a
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
smiled
at
Bessie
's
frank
answer
:
I
felt
that
it
was
correct
,
but
I
*NL*
confess
I
was
not
quite
indifferent
to
its
import
:
at
eighteen
most
*NL*
people
wish
to
please
,
and
the
conviction
that
they
have
not
an
exterior
*NL*
likely
to
second
that
desire
brings
anything
but
gratification
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dare
say
you
are
clever
,
though
,
''
continued
Bessie
,
by
way
of
solace
.
*NL*
``
What
can
you
do
?
Can
you
play
on
the
piano
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
little
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
one
in
the
room
;
Bessie
went
and
opened
it
,
and
then
asked
me
*NL*
to
sit
down
and
give
her
a
tune
:
I
played
a
waltz
or
two
,
and
she
was
*NL*
charmed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Miss
Reeds
could
not
play
as
well
!
''
said
she
exultingly
.
``
I
always
*NL*
said
you
would
surpass
them
in
learning
:
and
can
you
draw
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
one
of
my
paintings
over
the
chimney-piece
.
''
It
was
a
landscape
*NL*
in
water
colours
,
of
which
I
had
made
a
present
to
the
superintendent
,
in
*NL*
acknowledgment
of
her
obliging
mediation
with
the
committee
on
my
behalf
,
*NL*
and
which
she
had
framed
and
glazed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
is
beautiful

Jane

It
is
as
fine
a
picture
as
any
Miss

drawing-master
could
paint
,
let
alone
the
young
ladies
themselves
,
*NL*
who
could
not
come
near
it

have
you
learnt
French

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

can
both

knew
you
would
be

get

on
whether
your
relations
notice
you

There
was
something
I
*NL*
wanted
to
ask
you

Have
you
ever
heard
anything
from
your

Never
in

*NL*
``
Well
,
you
know
Missis
always
said
they
were
poor
and
quite
despicable
:
*NL*
and
they
may
be
poor
;
but
I
believe
they
are
as
much
gentry
as
the
Reeds
*NL*
are
;
for
one
day
,
nearly
seven
years
ago
,
a
Mr.
Eyre
came
to
Gateshead
*NL*
and
wanted
to
see
you
;
Missis
said
you
were
at
school
fifty
miles
off
;
he
*NL*
seemed
so
much
disappointed
,
for
he
could
not
stay
:
he
was
going
on
a
*NL*
voyage
to
a
foreign
country
,
and
the
ship
was
to
sail
from
London
in
a
*NL*
day
or
two
.
He
looked
quite
a
gentleman
,
and
I
believe
he
was
your
*NL*
father
's
brother
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
foreign
country
was
he
going
to

*NL*
*NL*
``
An
island
thousands
of
miles
off

where
they
make
wine

the
butler
did
*NL*
tell
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
Madeira

I
suggested

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

that
is
it

that
is
the

So
he
went
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

he
did
not
stay
many
minutes
in
the
house

was
very
high

with
him

she
called
him
afterwards
a
`
sneaking
tradesman
.
'
My
Robert
*NL*
believes
he
was
a
wine-merchant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
likely
,
''
I
returned
;
``
or
perhaps
clerk
or
agent
to
a
*NL*
wine-merchant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bessie
and
I
conversed
about
old
times
an
hour
longer
,
and
then
she
was
*NL*
obliged
to
leave
me
:
I
saw
her
again
for
a
few
minutes
the
next
morning
*NL*
at
Lowton
,
while
I
was
waiting
for
the
coach
.
We
parted
finally
at
the
*NL*
door
of
the
Brocklehurst
Arms
there
:
each
went
her
separate
way
;
she
set
*NL*
off
for
the
brow
of
Lowood
Fell
to
meet
the
conveyance
which
was
to
take
*NL*
her
back
to
Gateshead
,
I
mounted
the
vehicle
which
was
to
bear
me
to
new
*NL*
duties
and
a
new
life
in
the
unknown
environs
of
Millcote
.

CHAPTER
XI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
new
chapter
in
a
novel
is
something
like
a
new
scene
in
a
play
;
and
*NL*
when
I
draw
up
the
curtain
this
time
,
reader
,
you
must
fancy
you
see
a
*NL*
room
in
the
George
Inn
at
Millcote
,
with
such
large
figured
papering
on
*NL*
the
walls
as
inn
rooms
have
;
such
a
carpet
,
such
furniture
,
such
*NL*
ornaments
on
the
mantelpiece
,
such
prints
,
including
a
portrait
of
George
*NL*
the
Third
,
and
another
of
the
Prince
of
Wales
,
and
a
representation
of
*NL*
the
death
of
Wolfe
.
All
this
is
visible
to
you
by
the
light
of
an
oil
*NL*
lamp
hanging
from
the
ceiling
,
and
by
that
of
an
excellent
fire
,
near
*NL*
which
I
sit
in
my
cloak
and
bonnet
;
my
muff
and
umbrella
lie
on
the
*NL*
table
,
and
I
am
warming
away
the
numbness
and
chill
contracted
by
sixteen
*NL*
hours
'
exposure
to
the
rawness
of
an
October
day
:
I
left
Lowton
at
four
*NL*
o'clock
a.m.
,
and
the
Millcote
town
clock
is
now
just
striking
eight
.
*NL*
*NL*
Reader
,
though
I
look
comfortably
accommodated
,
I
am
not
very
tranquil
in
*NL*
my
mind
.
I
thought
when
the
coach
stopped
here
there
would
be
some
one
*NL*
to
meet
me
;
I
looked
anxiously
round
as
I
descended
the
wooden
steps
the
*NL*
``
boots
''
placed
for
my
convenience
,
expecting
to
hear
my
name
pronounced
,
*NL*
and
to
see
some
description
of
carriage
waiting
to
convey
me
to
*NL*
Thornfield
.
Nothing
of
the
sort
was
visible
;
and
when
I
asked
a
waiter
*NL*
if
any
one
had
been
to
inquire
after
a
Miss
Eyre
,
I
was
answered
in
the
*NL*
negative
:
so
I
had
no
resource
but
to
request
to
be
shown
into
a
private
*NL*
room
:
and
here
I
am
waiting
,
while
all
sorts
of
doubts
and
fears
are
*NL*
troubling
my
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
a
very
strange
sensation
to
inexperienced
youth
to
feel
itself
*NL*
quite
alone
in
the
world
,
cut
adrift
from
every
connection
,
uncertain
*NL*
whether
the
port
to
which
it
is
bound
can
be
reached
,
and
prevented
by
*NL*
many
impediments
from
returning
to
that
it
has
quitted
.
The
charm
of
*NL*
adventure
sweetens
that
sensation
,
the
glow
of
pride
warms
it
;
but
then
*NL*
the
throb
of
fear
disturbs
it
;
and
fear
with
me
became
predominant
when
*NL*
half-an-hour
elapsed
and
still
I
was
alone
.
I
bethought
myself
to
ring
*NL*
the
bell
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
a
place
in
this
neighbourhood
called
Thornfield
?
''
I
asked
of
*NL*
the
waiter
who
answered
the
summons
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thornfield
?
I
do
n't
know
,
ma'am
;
I
'll
inquire
at
the
bar
.
''
He
*NL*
vanished
,
but
reappeared
instantly
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
your
name
Eyre
,
Miss
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Person
here
waiting
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
jumped
up
,
took
my
muff
and
umbrella
,
and
hastened
into
the
*NL*
inn-passage
:
a
man
was
standing
by
the
open
door
,
and
in
the
lamp-lit
*NL*
street
I
dimly
saw
a
one-horse
conveyance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
will
be
your
luggage
,
I
suppose
?
''
said
the
man
rather
abruptly
when
*NL*
he
saw
me
,
pointing
to
my
trunk
in
the
passage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
He
hoisted
it
on
to
the
vehicle
,
which
was
a
sort
of
car
,
and
*NL*
then
I
got
in
;
before
he
shut
me
up
,
I
asked
him
how
far
it
was
to
*NL*
Thornfield
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
matter
of
six
miles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
long
shall
we
be
before
we
get
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Happen
an
hour
and
a
half
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
fastened
the
car
door
,
climbed
to
his
own
seat
outside
,
and
we
set
*NL*
off
.
Our
progress
was
leisurely
,
and
gave
me
ample
time
to
reflect
;
I
*NL*
was
content
to
be
at
length
so
near
the
end
of
my
journey
;
and
as
I
*NL*
leaned
back
in
the
comfortable
though
not
elegant
conveyance
,
I
meditated
*NL*
much
at
my
ease
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
,
''
thought
I
,
``
judging
from
the
plainness
of
the
servant
and
*NL*
carriage
,
Mrs.
Fairfax
is
not
a
very
dashing
person
:
so
much
the
better
;
*NL*
I
never
lived
amongst
fine
people
but
once
,
and
I
was
very
miserable
with
*NL*
them
.
I
wonder
if
she
lives
alone
except
this
little
girl
;
if
so
,
and
if
*NL*
she
is
in
any
degree
amiable
,
I
shall
surely
be
able
to
get
on
with
her
;
*NL*
I
will
do
my
best
;
it
is
a
pity
that
doing
one
's
best
does
not
always
*NL*
answer
.
At
Lowood
,
indeed
,
I
took
that
resolution
,
kept
it
,
and
*NL*
succeeded
in
pleasing
;
but
with
Mrs.
Reed
,
I
remember
my
best
was
always
*NL*
spurned
with
scorn
.
I
pray
God
Mrs.
Fairfax
may
not
turn
out
a
second
*NL*
Mrs.
Reed
;
but
if
she
does
,
I
am
not
bound
to
stay
with
her
!
let
the
*NL*
worst
come
to
the
worst
,
I
can
advertise
again
.
How
far
are
we
on
our
*NL*
road
now
,
I
wonder
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
let
down
the
window
and
looked
out
;
Millcote
was
behind
us
;
judging
by
*NL*
the
number
of
its
lights
,
it
seemed
a
place
of
considerable
magnitude
,
*NL*
much
larger
than
Lowton
.
We
were
now
,
as
far
as
I
could
see
,
on
a
sort
*NL*
of
common
;
but
there
were
houses
scattered
all
over
the
district
;
I
felt
*NL*
we
were
in
a
different
region
to
Lowood
,
more
populous
,
less
picturesque
;
*NL*
more
stirring
,
less
romantic
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
roads
were
heavy
,
the
night
misty
;
my
conductor
let
his
horse
walk
*NL*
all
the
way
,
and
the
hour
and
a
half
extended
,
I
verily
believe
,
to
two
*NL*
hours
;
at
last
he
turned
in
his
seat
and
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
noan
so
far
fro
'
Thornfield
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
I
looked
out
:
we
were
passing
a
church
;
I
saw
its
low
broad
tower
*NL*
against
the
sky
,
and
its
bell
was
tolling
a
quarter
;
I
saw
a
narrow
*NL*
galaxy
of
lights
too
,
on
a
hillside
,
marking
a
village
or
hamlet
.
About
*NL*
ten
minutes
after
,
the
driver
got
down
and
opened
a
pair
of
gates
:
we
*NL*
passed
through
,
and
they
clashed
to
behind
us
.
We
now
slowly
ascended
a
*NL*
drive
,
and
came
upon
the
long
front
of
a
house
:
candlelight
gleamed
from
*NL*
one
curtained
bow-window
;
all
the
rest
were
dark
.
The
car
stopped
at
the
*NL*
front
door
;
it
was
opened
by
a
maid-servant
;
I
alighted
and
went
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
walk
this
way
,
ma'am
?
''
said
the
girl
;
and
I
followed
her
across
*NL*
a
square
hall
with
high
doors
all
round
:
she
ushered
me
into
a
room
whose
*NL*
double
illumination
of
fire
and
candle
at
first
dazzled
me
,
contrasting
*NL*
as
it
did
with
the
darkness
to
which
my
eyes
had
been
for
two
hours
*NL*
inured
;
when
I
could
see
,
however
,
a
cosy
and
agreeable
picture
presented
*NL*
itself
to
my
view
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
snug
small
room
;
a
round
table
by
a
cheerful
fire
;
an
arm-chair
high
-
*NL*
backed
and
old-fashioned
,
wherein
sat
the
neatest
imaginable
little
*NL*
elderly
lady
,
in
widow
's
cap
,
black
silk
gown
,
and
snowy
muslin
apron
;
*NL*
exactly
like
what
I
had
fancied
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
only
less
stately
and
*NL*
milder
looking
.
She
was
occupied
in
knitting
;
a
large
cat
sat
demurely
*NL*
at
her
feet
;
nothing
in
short
was
wanting
to
complete
the
beau-ideal
of
*NL*
domestic
comfort
.
A
more
reassuring
introduction
for
a
new
governess
*NL*
could
scarcely
be
conceived
;
there
was
no
grandeur
to
overwhelm
,
no
*NL*
stateliness
to
embarrass
;
and
then
,
as
I
entered
,
the
old
lady
got
up
and
*NL*
promptly
and
kindly
came
forward
to
meet
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
do
,
my
dear
?
I
am
afraid
you
have
had
a
tedious
ride
;
John
*NL*
drives
so
slowly
;
you
must
be
cold
,
come
to
the
fire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
I
suppose
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
are
right
:
do
sit
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
conducted
me
to
her
own
chair
,
and
then
began
to
remove
my
shawl
and
*NL*
untie
my
bonnet-strings
;
I
begged
she
would
not
give
herself
so
much
*NL*
trouble
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
is
no
trouble
;
I
dare
say
your
own
hands
are
almost
numbed
with
*NL*
cold
.
Leah
,
make
a
little
hot
negus
and
cut
a
sandwich
or
two
:
here
are
*NL*
the
keys
of
the
storeroom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
produced
from
her
pocket
a
most
housewifely
bunch
of
keys
,
and
*NL*
delivered
them
to
the
servant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
then
,
draw
nearer
to
the
fire
,
''
she
continued
.
``
You
've
brought
*NL*
your
luggage
with
you
,
have
n't
you
,
my
dear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
ma'am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
see
it
carried
into
your
room
,
''
she
said
,
and
bustled
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
treats
me
like
a
visitor
,
''
thought
I.
``
I
little
expected
such
a
*NL*
reception
;
I
anticipated
only
coldness
and
stiffness
:
this
is
not
like
*NL*
what
I
have
heard
of
the
treatment
of
governesses
;
but
I
must
not
exult
*NL*
too
soon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
returned
;
with
her
own
hands
cleared
her
knitting
apparatus
and
a
*NL*
book
or
two
from
the
table
,
to
make
room
for
the
tray
which
Leah
now
*NL*
brought
,
and
then
herself
handed
me
the
refreshments
.
I
felt
rather
*NL*
confused
at
being
the
object
of
more
attention
than
I
had
ever
before
*NL*
received
,
and
,
that
too
,
shown
by
my
employer
and
superior
;
but
as
she
*NL*
did
not
herself
seem
to
consider
she
was
doing
anything
out
of
her
place
,
*NL*
I
thought
it
better
to
take
her
civilities
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
Miss
Fairfax
to-night
?
''
I
asked
,
*NL*
when
I
had
partaken
of
what
she
offered
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
you
say
,
my
dear
?
I
am
a
little
deaf
,
''
returned
the
good
lady
,
*NL*
approaching
her
ear
to
my
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
repeated
the
question
more
distinctly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Fairfax
?
Oh
,
you
mean
Miss
Varens
!
Varens
is
the
name
of
your
*NL*
future
pupil
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
!
Then
she
is
not
your
daughter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
--
I
have
no
family
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
should
have
followed
up
my
first
inquiry
,
by
asking
in
what
way
Miss
*NL*
Varens
was
connected
with
her
;
but
I
recollected
it
was
not
polite
to
ask
*NL*
too
many
questions
:
besides
,
I
was
sure
to
hear
in
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
so
glad
,
''
she
continued
,
as
she
sat
down
opposite
to
me
,
and
took
*NL*
the
cat
on
her
knee
;
``
I
am
so
glad
you
are
come
;
it
will
be
quite
*NL*
pleasant
living
here
now
with
a
companion
.
To
be
sure
it
is
pleasant
at
*NL*
any
time
;
for
Thornfield
is
a
fine
old
hall
,
rather
neglected
of
late
*NL*
years
perhaps
,
but
still
it
is
a
respectable
place
;
yet
you
know
in
*NL*
winter-time
one
feels
dreary
quite
alone
in
the
best
quarters
.
I
say
*NL*
alone
--
Leah
is
a
nice
girl
to
be
sure
,
and
John
and
his
wife
are
very
*NL*
decent
people
;
but
then
you
see
they
are
only
servants
,
and
one
ca
n't
*NL*
converse
with
them
on
terms
of
equality
:
one
must
keep
them
at
due
*NL*
distance
,
for
fear
of
losing
one
's
authority
.
I
'm
sure
last
winter
-LRB-
it
*NL*
was
a
very
severe
one
,
if
you
recollect
,
and
when
it
did
not
snow
,
it
*NL*
rained
and
blew
-RRB-
,
not
a
creature
but
the
butcher
and
postman
came
to
the
*NL*
house
,
from
November
till
February
;
and
I
really
got
quite
melancholy
*NL*
with
sitting
night
after
night
alone
;
I
had
Leah
in
to
read
to
me
*NL*
sometimes
;
but
I
do
n't
think
the
poor
girl
liked
the
task
much
:
she
felt
*NL*
it
confining
.
In
spring
and
summer
one
got
on
better
:
sunshine
and
long
*NL*
days
make
such
a
difference
;
and
then
,
just
at
the
commencement
of
this
*NL*
autumn
,
little
Adela
Varens
came
and
her
nurse
:
a
child
makes
a
house
*NL*
alive
all
at
once
;
and
now
you
are
here
I
shall
be
quite
gay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
heart
really
warmed
to
the
worthy
lady
as
I
heard
her
talk
;
and
I
drew
*NL*
my
chair
a
little
nearer
to
her
,
and
expressed
my
sincere
wish
that
she
*NL*
might
find
my
company
as
agreeable
as
she
anticipated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
'll
not
keep
you
sitting
up
late
to-night
,
''
said
she
;
``
it
is
on
the
*NL*
stroke
of
twelve
now
,
and
you
have
been
travelling
all
day
:
you
must
feel
*NL*
tired
.
If
you
have
got
your
feet
well
warmed
,
I
'll
show
you
your
*NL*
bedroom
.
I
've
had
the
room
next
to
mine
prepared
for
you
;
it
is
only
a
*NL*
small
apartment
,
but
I
thought
you
would
like
it
better
than
one
of
the
*NL*
large
front
chambers
:
to
be
sure
they
have
finer
furniture
,
but
they
are
*NL*
so
dreary
and
solitary
,
I
never
sleep
in
them
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thanked
her
for
her
considerate
choice
,
and
as
I
really
felt
fatigued
*NL*
with
my
long
journey
,
expressed
my
readiness
to
retire
.
She
took
her
*NL*
candle
,
and
I
followed
her
from
the
room
.
First
she
went
to
see
if
the
*NL*
hall-door
was
fastened
;
having
taken
the
key
from
the
lock
,
she
led
the
*NL*
way
upstairs
.
The
steps
and
banisters
were
of
oak
;
the
staircase
window
*NL*
was
high
and
latticed
;
both
it
and
the
long
gallery
into
which
the
*NL*
bedroom
doors
opened
looked
as
if
they
belonged
to
a
church
rather
than
a
*NL*
house
.
A
very
chill
and
vault-like
air
pervaded
the
stairs
and
gallery
,
*NL*
suggesting
cheerless
ideas
of
space
and
solitude
;
and
I
was
glad
,
when
*NL*
finally
ushered
into
my
chamber
,
to
find
it
of
small
dimensions
,
and
*NL*
furnished
in
ordinary
,
modern
style
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Mrs.
Fairfax
had
bidden
me
a
kind
good-night
,
and
I
had
fastened
my
*NL*
door
,
gazed
leisurely
round
,
and
in
some
measure
effaced
the
eerie
*NL*
impression
made
by
that
wide
hall
,
that
dark
and
spacious
staircase
,
and
*NL*
that
long
,
cold
gallery
,
by
the
livelier
aspect
of
my
little
room
,
I
*NL*
remembered
that
,
after
a
day
of
bodily
fatigue
and
mental
anxiety
,
I
was
*NL*
now
at
last
in
safe
haven
.
The
impulse
of
gratitude
swelled
my
heart
,
*NL*
and
I
knelt
down
at
the
bedside
,
and
offered
up
thanks
where
thanks
were
*NL*
due
;
not
forgetting
,
ere
I
rose
,
to
implore
aid
on
my
further
path
,
and
*NL*
the
power
of
meriting
the
kindness
which
seemed
so
frankly
offered
me
*NL*
before
it
was
earned
.
My
couch
had
no
thorns
in
it
that
night
;
my
*NL*
solitary
room
no
fears
.
At
once
weary
and
content
,
I
slept
soon
and
*NL*
soundly
:
when
I
awoke
it
was
broad
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
chamber
looked
such
a
bright
little
place
to
me
as
the
sun
shone
in
*NL*
between
the
gay
blue
chintz
window
curtains
,
showing
papered
walls
and
a
*NL*
carpeted
floor
,
so
unlike
the
bare
planks
and
stained
plaster
of
Lowood
,
*NL*
that
my
spirits
rose
at
the
view
.
Externals
have
a
great
effect
on
the
*NL*
young
:
I
thought
that
a
fairer
era
of
life
was
beginning
for
me
,
one
that
*NL*
was
to
have
its
flowers
and
pleasures
,
as
well
as
its
thorns
and
toils
.
*NL*
My
faculties
,
roused
by
the
change
of
scene
,
the
new
field
offered
to
*NL*
hope
,
seemed
all
astir
.
I
can
not
precisely
define
what
they
expected
,
*NL*
but
it
was
something
pleasant
:
not
perhaps
that
day
or
that
month
,
but
at
*NL*
an
indefinite
future
period
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
rose
;
I
dressed
myself
with
care
:
obliged
to
be
plain
--
for
I
had
no
*NL*
article
of
attire
that
was
not
made
with
extreme
simplicity
--
I
was
still
*NL*
by
nature
solicitous
to
be
neat
.
It
was
not
my
habit
to
be
disregardful
*NL*
of
appearance
or
careless
of
the
impression
I
made
:
on
the
contrary
,
I
*NL*
ever
wished
to
look
as
well
as
I
could
,
and
to
please
as
much
as
my
want
*NL*
of
beauty
would
permit
.
I
sometimes
regretted
that
I
was
not
handsomer
;
*NL*
I
sometimes
wished
to
have
rosy
cheeks
,
a
straight
nose
,
and
small
cherry
*NL*
mouth
;
I
desired
to
be
tall
,
stately
,
and
finely
developed
in
figure
;
I
*NL*
felt
it
a
misfortune
that
I
was
so
little
,
so
pale
,
and
had
features
so
*NL*
irregular
and
so
marked
.
And
why
had
I
these
aspirations
and
these
*NL*
regrets
?
It
would
be
difficult
to
say
:
I
could
not
then
distinctly
say
*NL*
it
to
myself
;
yet
I
had
a
reason
,
and
a
logical
,
natural
reason
too
.
*NL*
However
,
when
I
had
brushed
my
hair
very
smooth
,
and
put
on
my
black
*NL*
frock
--
which
,
Quakerlike
as
it
was
,
at
least
had
the
merit
of
fitting
to
*NL*
a
nicety
--
and
adjusted
my
clean
white
tucker
,
I
thought
I
should
do
*NL*
respectably
enough
to
appear
before
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
and
that
my
new
pupil
*NL*
would
not
at
least
recoil
from
me
with
antipathy
.
Having
opened
my
*NL*
chamber
window
,
and
seen
that
I
left
all
things
straight
and
neat
on
the
*NL*
toilet
table
,
I
ventured
forth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Traversing
the
long
and
matted
gallery
,
I
descended
the
slippery
steps
of
*NL*
oak
;
then
I
gained
the
hall
:
I
halted
there
a
minute
;
I
looked
at
some
*NL*
pictures
on
the
walls
-LRB-
one
,
I
remember
,
represented
a
grim
man
in
a
*NL*
cuirass
,
and
one
a
lady
with
powdered
hair
and
a
pearl
necklace
-RRB-
,
at
a
*NL*
bronze
lamp
pendent
from
the
ceiling
,
at
a
great
clock
whose
case
was
of
*NL*
oak
curiously
carved
,
and
ebon
black
with
time
and
rubbing
.
Everything
*NL*
appeared
very
stately
and
imposing
to
me
;
but
then
I
was
so
little
*NL*
accustomed
to
grandeur
.
The
hall-door
,
which
was
half
of
glass
,
stood
*NL*
open
;
I
stepped
over
the
threshold
.
It
was
a
fine
autumn
morning
;
the
*NL*
early
sun
shone
serenely
on
embrowned
groves
and
still
green
fields
;
*NL*
advancing
on
to
the
lawn
,
I
looked
up
and
surveyed
the
front
of
the
*NL*
mansion
.
It
was
three
storeys
high
,
of
proportions
not
vast
,
though
*NL*
considerable
:
a
gentleman
's
manor-house
,
not
a
nobleman
's
seat
:
*NL*
battlements
round
the
top
gave
it
a
picturesque
look
.
Its
grey
front
*NL*
stood
out
well
from
the
background
of
a
rookery
,
whose
cawing
tenants
*NL*
were
now
on
the
wing
:
they
flew
over
the
lawn
and
grounds
to
alight
in
a
*NL*
great
meadow
,
from
which
these
were
separated
by
a
sunk
fence
,
and
where
*NL*
an
array
of
mighty
old
thorn
trees
,
strong
,
knotty
,
and
broad
as
oaks
,
at
*NL*
once
explained
the
etymology
of
the
mansion
's
designation
.
Farther
off
*NL*
were
hills
:
not
so
lofty
as
those
round
Lowood
,
nor
so
craggy
,
nor
so
*NL*
like
barriers
of
separation
from
the
living
world
;
but
yet
quiet
and
*NL*
lonely
hills
enough
,
and
seeming
to
embrace
Thornfield
with
a
seclusion
I
*NL*
had
not
expected
to
find
existent
so
near
the
stirring
locality
of
*NL*
Millcote
.
A
little
hamlet
,
whose
roofs
were
blent
with
trees
,
straggled
*NL*
up
the
side
of
one
of
these
hills
;
the
church
of
the
district
stood
*NL*
nearer
Thornfield
:
its
old
tower-top
looked
over
a
knoll
between
the
*NL*
house
and
gates
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
yet
enjoying
the
calm
prospect
and
pleasant
fresh
air
,
yet
*NL*
listening
with
delight
to
the
cawing
of
the
rooks
,
yet
surveying
the
*NL*
wide
,
hoary
front
of
the
hall
,
and
thinking
what
a
great
place
it
was
for
*NL*
one
lonely
little
dame
like
Mrs.
Fairfax
to
inhabit
,
when
that
lady
*NL*
appeared
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
out
already
?
''
said
she
.
``
I
see
you
are
an
early
riser
.
''
I
went
*NL*
up
to
her
,
and
was
received
with
an
affable
kiss
and
shake
of
the
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
like
Thornfield
?
''
she
asked
.
I
told
her
I
liked
it
very
*NL*
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
said
,
``
it
is
a
pretty
place
;
but
I
fear
it
will
be
getting
out
*NL*
of
order
,
unless
Mr.
Rochester
should
take
it
into
his
head
to
come
and
*NL*
reside
here
permanently
;
or
,
at
least
,
visit
it
rather
oftener
:
great
*NL*
houses
and
fine
grounds
require
the
presence
of
the
proprietor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Rochester
!
''
I
exclaimed
.
``
Who
is
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
owner
of
Thornfield
,
''
she
responded
quietly
.
``
Did
you
not
know
he
*NL*
was
called
Rochester
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
I
did
not
--
I
had
never
heard
of
him
before
;
but
the
old
lady
*NL*
seemed
to
regard
his
existence
as
a
universally
understood
fact
,
with
*NL*
which
everybody
must
be
acquainted
by
instinct
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
,
''
I
continued
,
``
Thornfield
belonged
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
me
?
Bless
you
,
child
;
what
an
idea
!
To
me
!
I
am
only
the
*NL*
housekeeper
--
the
manager
.
To
be
sure
I
am
distantly
related
to
the
*NL*
Rochesters
by
the
mother
's
side
,
or
at
least
my
husband
was
;
he
was
a
*NL*
clergyman
,
incumbent
of
Hay
--
that
little
village
yonder
on
the
hill
--
and
*NL*
that
church
near
the
gates
was
his
.
The
present
Mr.
Rochester
's
mother
*NL*
was
a
Fairfax
,
and
second
cousin
to
my
husband
:
but
I
never
presume
on
*NL*
the
connection
--
in
fact
,
it
is
nothing
to
me
;
I
consider
myself
quite
in
*NL*
the
light
of
an
ordinary
housekeeper
:
my
employer
is
always
civil
,
and
I
*NL*
expect
nothing
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
little
girl
--
my
pupil
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
Mr.
Rochester
's
ward
;
he
commissioned
me
to
find
a
governess
for
*NL*
her
.
He
intended
to
have
her
brought
up
in
--
shire
,
I
believe
.
Here
*NL*
she
comes
,
with
her
`
bonne
,
'
as
she
calls
her
nurse
.
''
The
enigma
then
*NL*
was
explained
:
this
affable
and
kind
little
widow
was
no
great
dame
;
but
*NL*
a
dependant
like
myself
.
I
did
not
like
her
the
worse
for
that
;
on
the
*NL*
contrary
,
I
felt
better
pleased
than
ever
.
The
equality
between
her
and
*NL*
me
was
real
;
not
the
mere
result
of
condescension
on
her
part
:
so
much
*NL*
the
better
--
my
position
was
all
the
freer
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
was
meditating
on
this
discovery
,
a
little
girl
,
followed
by
her
*NL*
attendant
,
came
running
up
the
lawn
.
I
looked
at
my
pupil
,
who
did
not
*NL*
at
first
appear
to
notice
me
:
she
was
quite
a
child
,
perhaps
seven
or
*NL*
eight
years
old
,
slightly
built
,
with
a
pale
,
small-featured
face
,
and
a
*NL*
redundancy
of
hair
falling
in
curls
to
her
waist
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
morning
,
Miss
Adela
,
''
said
Mrs.
Fairfax
.
``
Come
and
speak
to
the
*NL*
lady
who
is
to
teach
you
,
and
to
make
you
a
clever
woman
some
day
.
''
She
*NL*
approached
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
C'est
la
ma
gouverante
!
''
said
she
,
pointing
to
me
,
and
addressing
her
*NL*
nurse
;
who
answered
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mais
oui
,
certainement
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
they
foreigners
?
''
I
inquired
,
amazed
at
hearing
the
French
language
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
nurse
is
a
foreigner
,
and
Adela
was
born
on
the
Continent
;
and
,
I
*NL*
believe
,
never
left
it
till
within
six
months
ago
.
When
she
first
came
*NL*
here
she
could
speak
no
English
;
now
she
can
make
shift
to
talk
it
a
*NL*
little
:
I
do
n't
understand
her
,
she
mixes
it
so
with
French
;
but
you
will
*NL*
make
out
her
meaning
very
well
,
I
dare
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fortunately
I
had
had
the
advantage
of
being
taught
French
by
a
French
*NL*
lady
;
and
as
I
had
always
made
a
point
of
conversing
with
Madame
Pierrot
*NL*
as
often
as
I
could
,
and
had
besides
,
during
the
last
seven
years
,
learnt
*NL*
a
portion
of
French
by
heart
daily
--
applying
myself
to
take
pains
with
my
*NL*
accent
,
and
imitating
as
closely
as
possible
the
pronunciation
of
my
*NL*
teacher
,
I
had
acquired
a
certain
degree
of
readiness
and
correctness
in
*NL*
the
language
,
and
was
not
likely
to
be
much
at
a
loss
with
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Adela
.
She
came
and
shook
hand
with
me
when
she
heard
that
I
was
her
*NL*
governess
;
and
as
I
led
her
in
to
breakfast
,
I
addressed
some
phrases
to
*NL*
her
in
her
own
tongue
:
she
replied
briefly
at
first
,
but
after
we
were
*NL*
seated
at
the
table
,
and
she
had
examined
me
some
ten
minutes
with
her
*NL*
large
hazel
eyes
,
she
suddenly
commenced
chattering
fluently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
cried
she
,
in
French
,
``
you
speak
my
language
as
well
as
Mr.
*NL*
Rochester
does
:
I
can
talk
to
you
as
I
can
to
him
,
and
so
can
Sophie
.
She
*NL*
will
be
glad
:
nobody
here
understands
her
:
Madame
Fairfax
is
all
English
.
*NL*
Sophie
is
my
nurse
;
she
came
with
me
over
the
sea
in
a
great
ship
with
a
*NL*
chimney
that
smoked
--
how
it
did
smoke
!
--
and
I
was
sick
,
and
so
was
*NL*
Sophie
,
and
so
was
Mr.
Rochester
.
Mr.
Rochester
lay
down
on
a
sofa
in
a
*NL*
pretty
room
called
the
salon
,
and
Sophie
and
I
had
little
beds
in
another
*NL*
place
.
I
nearly
fell
out
of
mine
;
it
was
like
a
shelf
.
And
*NL*
Mademoiselle
--
what
is
your
name
?

Bah
!
I
can
not
say
it
.
Well
,
our
ship
stopped
in
the
morning
,
*NL*
before
it
was
quite
daylight
,
at
a
great
city
--
a
huge
city
,
with
very
*NL*
dark
houses
and
all
smoky
;
not
at
all
like
the
pretty
clean
town
I
came
*NL*
from
;
and
Mr.
Rochester
carried
me
in
his
arms
over
a
plank
to
the
land
,
*NL*
and
Sophie
came
after
,
and
we
all
got
into
a
coach
,
which
took
us
to
a
*NL*
beautiful
large
house
,
larger
than
this
and
finer
,
called
an
hotel
.
We
*NL*
stayed
there
nearly
a
week
:
I
and
Sophie
used
to
walk
every
day
in
a
*NL*
great
green
place
full
of
trees
,
called
the
Park
;
and
there
were
many
*NL*
children
there
besides
me
,
and
a
pond
with
beautiful
birds
in
it
,
that
I
*NL*
fed
with
crumbs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
understand
her
when
she
runs
on
so
fast
?
''
asked
Mrs.
Fairfax
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
understood
her
very
well
,
for
I
had
been
accustomed
to
the
fluent
*NL*
tongue
of
Madame
Pierrot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
,
''
continued
the
good
lady
,
``
you
would
ask
her
a
question
or
two
*NL*
about
her
parents
:
I
wonder
if
she
remembers
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Adele
,
''
I
inquired
,
``
with
whom
did
you
live
when
you
were
in
that
pretty
*NL*
clean
town
you
spoke
of
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
lived
long
ago
with
mama
;
but
she
is
gone
to
the
Holy
Virgin
.
Mama
*NL*
used
to
teach
me
to
dance
and
sing
,
and
to
say
verses
.
A
great
many
*NL*
gentlemen
and
ladies
came
to
see
mama
,
and
I
used
to
dance
before
them
,
*NL*
or
to
sit
on
their
knees
and
sing
to
them
:
I
liked
it
.
Shall
I
let
you
*NL*
hear
me
sing
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
finished
her
breakfast
,
so
I
permitted
her
to
give
a
specimen
of
*NL*
her
accomplishments
.
Descending
from
her
chair
,
she
came
and
placed
*NL*
herself
on
my
knee
;
then
,
folding
her
little
hands
demurely
before
her
,
*NL*
shaking
back
her
curls
and
lifting
her
eyes
to
the
ceiling
,
she
commenced
*NL*
singing
a
song
from
some
opera
.
It
was
the
strain
of
a
forsaken
lady
,
*NL*
who
,
after
bewailing
the
perfidy
of
her
lover
,
calls
pride
to
her
aid
;
*NL*
desires
her
attendant
to
deck
her
in
her
brightest
jewels
and
richest
*NL*
robes
,
and
resolves
to
meet
the
false
one
that
night
at
a
ball
,
and
prove
*NL*
to
him
,
by
the
gaiety
of
her
demeanour
,
how
little
his
desertion
has
*NL*
affected
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
subject
seemed
strangely
chosen
for
an
infant
singer
;
but
I
suppose
*NL*
the
point
of
the
exhibition
lay
in
hearing
the
notes
of
love
and
jealousy
*NL*
warbled
with
the
lisp
of
childhood
;
and
in
very
bad
taste
that
point
was
:
*NL*
at
least
I
thought
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
Adele
sang
the
canzonette
tunefully
enough
,
and
with
the
_
naivete
_
of
her
*NL*
age
.
This
achieved
,
she
jumped
from
my
knee
and
said
,
``
Now
,
*NL*
Mademoiselle
,
I
will
repeat
you
some
poetry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Assuming
an
attitude
,
she
began
,
``
La
Ligue
des
Rats
:
fable
de
La
*NL*
Fontaine
.
''
She
then
declaimed
the
little
piece
with
an
attention
to
*NL*
punctuation
and
emphasis
,
a
flexibility
of
voice
and
an
appropriateness
*NL*
of
gesture
,
very
unusual
indeed
at
her
age
,
and
which
proved
she
had
been
*NL*
carefully
trained
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
it
your
mama
who
taught
you
that
piece
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
she
just
used
to
say
it
in
this
way
:
`
Qu
'
avez
vous
donc
?
lui
*NL*
dit
un
de
ces
rats
;
parlez
!
'
She
made
me
lift
my
hand
--
so
--
to
remind
me
*NL*
to
raise
my
voice
at
the
question
.
Now
shall
I
dance
for
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
that
will
do
:
but
after
your
mama
went
to
the
Holy
Virgin
,
as
you
*NL*
say
,
with
whom
did
you
live
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
Madame
Frederic
and
her
husband
:
she
took
care
of
me
,
but
she
is
*NL*
nothing
related
to
me
.
I
think
she
is
poor
,
for
she
had
not
so
fine
a
*NL*
house
as
mama
.
I
was
not
long
there
.
Mr.
Rochester
asked
me
if
I
would
*NL*
like
to
go
and
live
with
him
in
England
,
and
I
said
yes
;
for
I
knew
Mr.
*NL*
Rochester
before
I
knew
Madame
Frederic
,
and
he
was
always
kind
to
me
and
*NL*
gave
me
pretty
dresses
and
toys
:
but
you
see
he
has
not
kept
his
word
,
*NL*
for
he
has
brought
me
to
England
,
and
now
he
is
gone
back
again
himself
,
*NL*
and
I
never
see
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
breakfast
,
Adele
and
I
withdrew
to
the
library
,
which
room
,
it
*NL*
appears
,
Mr.
Rochester
had
directed
should
be
used
as
the
schoolroom
.
*NL*
Most
of
the
books
were
locked
up
behind
glass
doors
;
but
there
was
one
*NL*
bookcase
left
open
containing
everything
that
could
be
needed
in
the
way
*NL*
of
elementary
works
,
and
several
volumes
of
light
literature
,
poetry
,
*NL*
biography
,
travels
,
a
few
romances
,
&
c.
I
suppose
he
had
considered
that
*NL*
these
were
all
the
governess
would
require
for
her
private
perusal
;
and
,
*NL*
indeed
,
they
contented
me
amply
for
the
present
;
compared
with
the
scanty
*NL*
pickings
I
had
now
and
then
been
able
to
glean
at
Lowood
,
they
seemed
to
*NL*
offer
an
abundant
harvest
of
entertainment
and
information
.
In
this
*NL*
room
,
too
,
there
was
a
cabinet
piano
,
quite
new
and
of
superior
tone
;
*NL*
also
an
easel
for
painting
and
a
pair
of
globes
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
found
my
pupil
sufficiently
docile
,
though
disinclined
to
apply
:
she
*NL*
had
not
been
used
to
regular
occupation
of
any
kind
.
I
felt
it
would
be
*NL*
injudicious
to
confine
her
too
much
at
first
;
so
,
when
I
had
talked
to
*NL*
her
a
great
deal
,
and
got
her
to
learn
a
little
,
and
when
the
morning
had
*NL*
advanced
to
noon
,
I
allowed
her
to
return
to
her
nurse
.
I
then
proposed
*NL*
to
occupy
myself
till
dinner-time
in
drawing
some
little
sketches
for
her
*NL*
use
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
was
going
upstairs
to
fetch
my
portfolio
and
pencils
,
Mrs.
Fairfax
*NL*
called
to
me
:
``
Your
morning
school-hours
are
over
now
,
I
suppose
,
''
said
*NL*
she
.
She
was
in
a
room
the
folding-doors
of
which
stood
open
:
I
went
in
*NL*
when
she
addressed
me
.
It
was
a
large
,
stately
apartment
,
with
purple
*NL*
chairs
and
curtains
,
a
Turkey
carpet
,
walnut-panelled
walls
,
one
vast
*NL*
window
rich
in
slanted
glass
,
and
a
lofty
ceiling
,
nobly
moulded
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Fairfax
was
dusting
some
vases
of
fine
purple
spar
,
which
stood
on
a
*NL*
sideboard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
beautiful
room
!
''
I
exclaimed
,
as
I
looked
round
;
for
I
had
never
*NL*
before
seen
any
half
so
imposing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
this
is
the
dining-room
.
I
have
just
opened
the
window
,
to
let
in
*NL*
a
little
air
and
sunshine
;
for
everything
gets
so
damp
in
apartments
that
*NL*
are
seldom
inhabited
;
the
drawing-room
yonder
feels
like
a
vault
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
pointed
to
a
wide
arch
corresponding
to
the
window
,
and
hung
like
it
*NL*
with
a
Tyrian-dyed
curtain
,
now
looped
up
.
Mounting
to
it
by
two
broad
*NL*
steps
,
and
looking
through
,
I
thought
I
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
fairy
*NL*
place
,
so
bright
to
my
novice-eyes
appeared
the
view
beyond
.
Yet
it
was
*NL*
merely
a
very
pretty
drawing-room
,
and
within
it
a
boudoir
,
both
spread
*NL*
with
white
carpets
,
on
which
seemed
laid
brilliant
garlands
of
flowers
;
*NL*
both
ceiled
with
snowy
mouldings
of
white
grapes
and
vine-leaves
,
beneath
*NL*
which
glowed
in
rich
contrast
crimson
couches
and
ottomans
;
while
the
*NL*
ornaments
on
the
pale
Parian
mantelpiece
were
of
sparkling
Bohemian
*NL*
glass
,
ruby
red
;
and
between
the
windows
large
mirrors
repeated
the
*NL*
general
blending
of
snow
and
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
what
order
you
keep
these
rooms
,
Mrs.
Fairfax
!
''
said
I.
``
No
dust
,
no
*NL*
canvas
coverings
:
except
that
the
air
feels
chilly
,
one
would
think
they
*NL*
were
inhabited
daily
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Miss
Eyre
,
though
Mr.
Rochester
's
visits
here
are
rare
,
they
are
*NL*
always
sudden
and
unexpected
;
and
as
I
observed
that
it
put
him
out
to
*NL*
find
everything
swathed
up
,
and
to
have
a
bustle
of
arrangement
on
his
*NL*
arrival
,
I
thought
it
best
to
keep
the
rooms
in
readiness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Mr.
Rochester
an
exacting
,
fastidious
sort
of
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
particularly
so
;
but
he
has
a
gentleman
's
tastes

habits

and
he

expects
to
have
things
managed
in
conformity
to
them

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
like
him
?
Is
he
generally
liked
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
;
the
family
have
always
been
respected
here
.
Almost
all
the
*NL*
land
in
this
neighbourhood
,
as
far
as
you
can
see
,
has
belonged
to
the
*NL*
Rochesters
time
out
of
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
but

leaving
his
land
out
of
the
question

liked

himself

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
cause
to
do
otherwise
than
like
him

and
I
believe
he
is
*NL*
considered
a
just
and
liberal
landlord
by
his
tenants
:
but
he
has
never
*NL*
lived
much
amongst
them

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
has
he
no
peculiarities

in

his

*NL*
``
Oh
!
his
character
is
unimpeachable

I
suppose

He
is
rather
peculiar
,
*NL*
perhaps
:
he
has
travelled
a
great
deal
,
and
seen
a
great
deal
of
the
*NL*
world
,
I
should
think
.
I
dare
say
he
is
clever
,
but
I
never
had
much
*NL*
conversation
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
what
way
is
he
peculiar
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
--
it
is
not
easy
to
describe
--
nothing
striking
,
but
you
feel

it
when
he
speaks
to
you
;
you
can
not
be
always
sure
whether
he
is
in
jest
*NL*
or
earnest
,
whether
he
is
pleased
or
the
contrary
;
you
do
n't
thoroughly
*NL*
understand
him
,
in
short
--
at
least
,
I
do
n't
:
but
it
is
of
no
consequence
,
*NL*
he
is
a
very
good
master
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
all
the
account
I
got
from
Mrs.
Fairfax
of
her
employer
and
*NL*
mine
.
There
are
people
who
seem
to
have
no
notion
of
sketching
a
*NL*
character
,
or
observing
and
describing
salient
points
,
either
in
persons
*NL*
or
things
:
the
good
lady
evidently
belonged
to
this
class
;
my
queries
*NL*
puzzled
,
but
did
not
draw
her
out
.
Mr.
Rochester
was
Mr.
Rochester
in
*NL*
her
eyes
;
a
gentleman
,
a
landed
proprietor
--
nothing
more
:
she
inquired
*NL*
and
searched
no
further
,
and
evidently
wondered
at
my
wish
to
gain
a
more
*NL*
definite
notion
of
his
identity
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
left
the
dining-room
,
she
proposed
to
show
me
over
the
rest
of
*NL*
the
house
;
and
I
followed
her
upstairs
and
downstairs
,
admiring
as
I
*NL*
went
;
for
all
was
well
arranged
and
handsome
.
The
large
front
chambers
I
*NL*
thought
especially
grand
:
and
some
of
the
third-storey
rooms
,
though
dark
*NL*
and
low
,
were
interesting
from
their
air
of
antiquity
.
The
furniture
*NL*
once
appropriated
to
the
lower
apartments
had
from
time
to
time
been
*NL*
removed
here
,
as
fashions
changed
:
and
the
imperfect
light
entering
by
*NL*
their
narrow
casement
showed
bedsteads
of
a
hundred
years
old
;
chests
in
*NL*
oak
or
walnut
,
looking
,
with
their
strange
carvings
of
palm
branches
and
*NL*
cherubs
'
heads
,
like
types
of
the
Hebrew
ark
;
rows
of
venerable
chairs
,
*NL*
high-backed
and
narrow
;
stools
still
more
antiquated
,
on
whose
cushioned
*NL*
tops
were
yet
apparent
traces
of
half-effaced
embroideries
,
wrought
by
*NL*
fingers
that
for
two
generations
had
been
coffin-dust
.
All
these
relics
*NL*
gave
to
the
third
storey
of
Thornfield
Hall
the
aspect
of
a
home
of
the
*NL*
past
:
a
shrine
of
memory
.
I
liked
the
hush
,
the
gloom
,
the
quaintness
of
*NL*
these
retreats
in
the
day
;
but
I
by
no
means
coveted
a
night
's
repose
on
*NL*
one
of
those
wide
and
heavy
beds
:
shut
in
,
some
of
them
,
with
doors
of
*NL*
oak
;
shaded
,
others
,
with
wrought
old
English
hangings
crusted
with
thick
*NL*
work
,
portraying
effigies
of
strange
flowers
,
and
stranger
birds
,
and
*NL*
strangest
human
beings
,
--
all
which
would
have
looked
strange
,
indeed
,
by
*NL*
the
pallid
gleam
of
moonlight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
the
servants
sleep
in
these
rooms
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
they
occupy
a
range
of
smaller
apartments
to
the
back
;
no
one
ever
*NL*
sleeps
here
:
one
would
almost
say
that
,
if
there
were
a
ghost
at
*NL*
Thornfield
Hall
,
this
would
be
its
haunt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
think
:
you
have
no
ghost
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
None
that
I
ever
heard
of
,
''
returned
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
any
traditions
of
one
?
no
legends
or
ghost
stories
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
not
.
And
yet
it
is
said
the
Rochesters
have
been
rather
a
*NL*
violent
than
a
quiet
race
in
their
time
:
perhaps
,
though
,
that
is
the
*NL*
reason
they
rest
tranquilly
in
their
graves
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
`
after
life
's
fitful
fever
they
sleep
well
,
'
''
I
muttered
.
``
Where
*NL*
are
you
going
now
,
Mrs.
Fairfax
?
''
for
she
was
moving
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
to
the
leads
;
will
you
come
and
see
the
view
from
thence
?
''
I
*NL*
followed
still
,
up
a
very
narrow
staircase
to
the
attics
,
and
thence
by
a
*NL*
ladder
and
through
a
trap-door
to
the
roof
of
the
hall
.
I
was
now
on
a
*NL*
level
with
the
crow
colony
,
and
could
see
into
their
nests
.
Leaning
over
*NL*
the
battlements
and
looking
far
down
,
I
surveyed
the
grounds
laid
out
*NL*
like
a
map
:
the
bright
and
velvet
lawn
closely
girdling
the
grey
base
of
*NL*
the
mansion
;
the
field
,
wide
as
a
park
,
dotted
with
its
ancient
timber
;
*NL*
the
wood
,
dun
and
sere
,
divided
by
a
path
visibly
overgrown
,
greener
with
*NL*
moss
than
the
trees
were
with
foliage
;
the
church
at
the
gates
,
the
road
,
*NL*
the
tranquil
hills
,
all
reposing
in
the
autumn
day
's
sun
;
the
horizon
*NL*
bounded
by
a
propitious
sky
,
azure
,
marbled
with
pearly
white
.
No
*NL*
feature
in
the
scene
was
extraordinary
,
but
all
was
pleasing
.
When
I
*NL*
turned
from
it
and
repassed
the
trap-door
,
I
could
scarcely
see
my
way
*NL*
down
the
ladder
;
the
attic
seemed
black
as
a
vault
compared
with
that
*NL*
arch
of
blue
air
to
which
I
had
been
looking
up
,
and
to
that
sunlit
scene
*NL*
of
grove
,
pasture
,
and
green
hill
,
of
which
the
hall
was
the
centre
,
and
*NL*
over
which
I
had
been
gazing
with
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Fairfax
stayed
behind
a
moment
to
fasten
the
trap-door
;
I
,
by
drift
*NL*
of
groping
,
found
the
outlet
from
the
attic
,
and
proceeded
to
descend
the
*NL*
narrow
garret
staircase
.
I
lingered
in
the
long
passage
to
which
this
*NL*
led
,
separating
the
front
and
back
rooms
of
the
third
storey
:
narrow
,
*NL*
low
,
and
dim
,
with
only
one
little
window
at
the
far
end
,
and
looking
,
*NL*
with
its
two
rows
of
small
black
doors
all
shut
,
like
a
corridor
in
some
*NL*
Bluebeard
's
castle
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
I
paced
softly
on
,
the
last
sound
I
expected
to
hear
in
so
still
a
*NL*
region
,
a
laugh
,
struck
my
ear
.
It
was
a
curious
laugh
;
distinct
,
*NL*
formal
,
mirthless
.
I
stopped
:
the
sound
ceased
,
only
for
an
instant
;
it
*NL*
began
again
,
louder
:
for
at
first
,
though
distinct
,
it
was
very
low
.
It
*NL*
passed
off
in
a
clamorous
peal
that
seemed
to
wake
an
echo
in
every
*NL*
lonely
chamber
;
though
it
originated
but
in
one
,
and
I
could
have
pointed
*NL*
out
the
door
whence
the
accents
issued
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Fairfax
!
''
I
called
out
:
for
I
now
heard
her
descending
the
great
*NL*
stairs
.
``
Did
you
hear
that
loud
laugh
?
Who
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
of
the
servants
,
very
likely
,
''
she
answered
:
``
perhaps
Grace
Poole
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
hear
it
?
''
I
again
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
plainly
:
I
often
hear
her
:
she
sews
in
one
of
these
rooms
.
*NL*
Sometimes
Leah
is
with
her
;
they
are
frequently
noisy
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
laugh
was
repeated
in
its
low
,
syllabic
tone
,
and
terminated
in
an
*NL*
odd
murmur
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Grace
!
''
exclaimed
Mrs.
Fairfax
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
really
did
not
expect
any
Grace
to
answer
;
for
the
laugh
was
as
tragic
,
*NL*
as
preternatural
a
laugh
as
any
I
ever
heard
;
and
,
but
that
it
was
high
*NL*
noon
,
and
that
no
circumstance
of
ghostliness
accompanied
the
curious
*NL*
cachinnation
;
but
that
neither
scene
nor
season
favoured
fear
,
I
should
*NL*
have
been
superstitiously
afraid
.
However
,
the
event
showed
me
I
was
a
*NL*
fool
for
entertaining
a
sense
even
of
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
nearest
me
opened
,
and
a
servant
came
out
,
--
a
woman
of
between
*NL*
thirty
and
forty
;
a
set
,
square-made
figure
,
red-haired
,
and
with
a
hard
,
*NL*
plain
face
:
any
apparition
less
romantic
or
less
ghostly
could
scarcely
*NL*
be
conceived
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Too
much
noise
,
Grace
,
''
said
Mrs.
Fairfax
.
``
Remember
directions
!
''
Grace
*NL*
curtseyed
silently
and
went
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
a
person
we
have
to
sew
and
assist
Leah
in
her
housemaid
's
work
,
''
*NL*
continued
the
widow
;
``
not
altogether
unobjectionable
in
some
points
,
but
*NL*
she
does
well
enough
.
By-the-bye
,
how
have
you
got
on
with
your
new
*NL*
pupil
this
morning
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
conversation
,
thus
turned
on
Adele
,
continued
till
we
reached
the
*NL*
light
and
cheerful
region
below
.
Adele
came
running
to
meet
us
in
the
*NL*
hall
,
exclaiming
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mesdames
,
vous
etes
servies
!
''
adding
,
``
J'ai
bien
faim
,
moi
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
found
dinner
ready
,
and
waiting
for
us
in
Mrs.
Fairfax
's
room
.

CHAPTER
XII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
promise
of
a
smooth
career
,
which
my
first
calm
introduction
to
*NL*
Thornfield
Hall
seemed
to
pledge
,
was
not
belied
on
a
longer
acquaintance
*NL*
with
the
place
and
its
inmates
.
Mrs.
Fairfax
turned
out
to
be
what
she
*NL*
appeared
,
a
placid-tempered
,
kind-natured
woman
,
of
competent
education
*NL*
and
average
intelligence
.
My
pupil
was
a
lively
child
,
who
had
been
*NL*
spoilt
and
indulged
,
and
therefore
was
sometimes
wayward
;
but
as
she
was
*NL*
committed
entirely
to
my
care
,
and
no
injudicious
interference
from
any
*NL*
quarter
ever
thwarted
my
plans
for
her
improvement
,
she
soon
forgot
her
*NL*
little
freaks
,
and
became
obedient
and
teachable
.
She
had
no
great
*NL*
talents
,
no
marked
traits
of
character
,
no
peculiar
development
of
*NL*
feeling
or
taste
which
raised
her
one
inch
above
the
ordinary
level
of
*NL*
childhood
;
but
neither
had
she
any
deficiency
or
vice
which
sunk
her
*NL*
below
it
.
She
made
reasonable
progress
,
entertained
for
me
a
vivacious
,
*NL*
though
perhaps
not
very
profound
,
affection
;
and
by
her
simplicity
,
gay
*NL*
prattle
,
and
efforts
to
please
,
inspired
me
,
in
return
,
with
a
degree
of
*NL*
attachment
sufficient
to
make
us
both
content
in
each
other
's
society
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
,
_
par
parenthese
_
,
will
be
thought
cool
language
by
persons
who
*NL*
entertain
solemn
doctrines
about
the
angelic
nature
of
children
,
and
the
*NL*
duty
of
those
charged
with
their
education
to
conceive
for
them
an
*NL*
idolatrous
devotion
:
but
I
am
not
writing
to
flatter
parental
egotism
,
to
*NL*
echo
cant
,
or
prop
up
humbug
;
I
am
merely
telling
the
truth
.
I
felt
a
*NL*
conscientious
solicitude
for
Adele
's
welfare
and
progress
,
and
a
quiet
*NL*
liking
for
her
little
self
:
just
as
I
cherished
towards
Mrs.
Fairfax
a
*NL*
thankfulness
for
her
kindness
,
and
a
pleasure
in
her
society
*NL*
proportionate
to
the
tranquil
regard
she
had
for
me
,
and
the
moderation
*NL*
of
her
mind
and
character
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anybody
may
blame
me
who
likes
,
when
I
add
further
,
that
,
now
and
then
,
*NL*
when
I
took
a
walk
by
myself
in
the
grounds
;
when
I
went
down
to
the
*NL*
gates
and
looked
through
them
along
the
road
;
or
when
,
while
Adele
played
*NL*
with
her
nurse
,
and
Mrs.
Fairfax
made
jellies
in
the
storeroom
,
I
climbed
*NL*
the
three
staircases
,
raised
the
trap-door
of
the
attic
,
and
having
*NL*
reached
the
leads
,
looked
out
afar
over
sequestered
field
and
hill
,
and
*NL*
along
dim
sky-line
--
that
then
I
longed
for
a
power
of
vision
which
might
*NL*
overpass
that
limit
;
which
might
reach
the
busy
world
,
towns
,
regions
*NL*
full
of
life
I
had
heard
of
but
never
seen
--
that
then
I
desired
more
of
*NL*
practical
experience
than
I
possessed
;
more
of
intercourse
with
my
kind
,
*NL*
of
acquaintance
with
variety
of
character
,
than
was
here
within
my
reach
.
*NL*
I
valued
what
was
good
in
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
and
what
was
good
in
Adele
;
but
I
*NL*
believed
in
the
existence
of
other
and
more
vivid
kinds
of
goodness
,
and
*NL*
what
I
believed
in
I
wished
to
behold
.
*NL*
*NL*
Who
blames
me
?
Many
,
no
doubt
;
and
I
shall
be
called
discontented
.
I
*NL*
could
not
help
it
:
the
restlessness
was
in
my
nature
;
it
agitated
me
to
*NL*
pain
sometimes
.
Then
my
sole
relief
was
to
walk
along
the
corridor
of
*NL*
the
third
storey
,
backwards
and
forwards
,
safe
in
the
silence
and
*NL*
solitude
of
the
spot
,
and
allow
my
mind
's
eye
to
dwell
on
whatever
bright
*NL*
visions
rose
before
it
--
and
,
certainly
,
they
were
many
and
glowing
;
to
*NL*
let
my
heart
be
heaved
by
the
exultant
movement
,
which
,
while
it
swelled
*NL*
it
in
trouble
,
expanded
it
with
life
;
and
,
best
of
all
,
to
open
my
inward
*NL*
ear
to
a
tale
that
was
never
ended
--
a
tale
my
imagination
created
,
and
*NL*
narrated
continuously
;
quickened
with
all
of
incident
,
life
,
fire
,
*NL*
feeling
,
that
I
desired
and
had
not
in
my
actual
existence
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
in
vain
to
say
human
beings
ought
to
be
satisfied
with
*NL*
tranquillity
:
they
must
have
action
;
and
they
will
make
it
if
they
can
not
*NL*
find
it
.
Millions
are
condemned
to
a
stiller
doom
than
mine
,
and
*NL*
millions
are
in
silent
revolt
against
their
lot
.
Nobody
knows
how
many
*NL*
rebellions
besides
political
rebellions
ferment
in
the
masses
of
life
*NL*
which
people
earth
.
Women
are
supposed
to
be
very
calm
generally
:
but
*NL*
women
feel
just
as
men
feel
;
they
need
exercise
for
their
faculties
,
and
*NL*
a
field
for
their
efforts
,
as
much
as
their
brothers
do
;
they
suffer
from
*NL*
too
rigid
a
restraint
,
too
absolute
a
stagnation
,
precisely
as
men
would
*NL*
suffer
;
and
it
is
narrow-minded
in
their
more
privileged
fellow-creatures
*NL*
to
say
that
they
ought
to
confine
themselves
to
making
puddings
and
*NL*
knitting
stockings
,
to
playing
on
the
piano
and
embroidering
bags
.
It
is
*NL*
thoughtless
to
condemn
them
,
or
laugh
at
them
,
if
they
seek
to
do
more
or
*NL*
learn
more
than
custom
has
pronounced
necessary
for
their
sex
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
thus
alone
,
I
not
unfrequently
heard
Grace
Poole
's
laugh
:
the
same
*NL*
peal
,
the
same
low
,
slow
ha
!
ha
!
which
,
when
first
heard
,
had
thrilled
*NL*
me
:
I
heard
,
too
,
her
eccentric
murmurs
;
stranger
than
her
laugh
.
There
*NL*
were
days
when
she
was
quite
silent
;
but
there
were
others
when
I
could
*NL*
not
account
for
the
sounds
she
made
.
Sometimes
I
saw
her
:
she
would
come
*NL*
out
of
her
room
with
a
basin
,
or
a
plate
,
or
a
tray
in
her
hand
,
go
down
*NL*
to
the
kitchen
and
shortly
return
,
generally
-LRB-
oh
,
romantic
reader
,
*NL*
forgive
me
for
telling
the
plain
truth
!
-RRB-
bearing
a
pot
of
porter
.
Her
*NL*
appearance
always
acted
as
a
damper
to
the
curiosity
raised
by
her
oral
*NL*
oddities
:
hard-featured
and
staid
,
she
had
no
point
to
which
interest
*NL*
could
attach
.
I
made
some
attempts
to
draw
her
into
conversation
,
but
*NL*
she
seemed
a
person
of
few
words
:
a
monosyllabic
reply
usually
cut
short
*NL*
every
effort
of
that
sort
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
members
of
the
household
,
viz.
,
John
and
his
wife
,
Leah
the
*NL*
housemaid
,
and
Sophie
the
French
nurse
,
were
decent
people
;
but
in
no
*NL*
respect
remarkable
;
with
Sophie
I
used
to
talk
French
,
and
sometimes
I
*NL*
asked
her
questions
about
her
native
country
;
but
she
was
not
of
a
*NL*
descriptive
or
narrative
turn
,
and
generally
gave
such
vapid
and
confused
*NL*
answers
as
were
calculated
rather
to
check
than
encourage
inquiry
.
*NL*
*NL*
October
,
November
,
December
passed
away
.
One
afternoon
in
January
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Fairfax
had
begged
a
holiday
for
Adele
,
because
she
had
a
cold
;
and
,
as
*NL*
Adele
seconded
the
request
with
an
ardour
that
reminded
me
how
precious
*NL*
occasional
holidays
had
been
to
me
in
my
own
childhood
,
I
accorded
it
,
*NL*
deeming
that
I
did
well
in
showing
pliability
on
the
point
.
It
was
a
*NL*
fine
,
calm
day
,
though
very
cold
;
I
was
tired
of
sitting
still
in
the
*NL*
library
through
a
whole
long
morning
:
Mrs.
Fairfax
had
just
written
a
*NL*
letter
which
was
waiting
to
be
posted
,
so
I
put
on
my
bonnet
and
cloak
*NL*
and
volunteered
to
carry
it
to
Hay
;
the
distance
,
two
miles
,
would
be
a
*NL*
pleasant
winter
afternoon
walk
.
Having
seen
Adele
comfortably
seated
in
*NL*
her
little
chair
by
Mrs.
Fairfax
's
parlour
fireside
,
and
given
her
her
*NL*
best
wax
doll
-LRB-
which
I
usually
kept
enveloped
in
silver
paper
in
a
*NL*
drawer
-RRB-
to
play
with
,
and
a
story-book
for
change
of
amusement
;
and
*NL*
having
replied
to
her
``
Revenez
bientot
,
ma
bonne
amie
,
ma
chere
Mdlle
.
*NL*
Jeannette
,
''
with
a
kiss
I
set
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ground
was
hard
,
the
air
was
still
,
my
road
was
lonely
;
I
walked
fast
*NL*
till
I
got
warm
,
and
then
I
walked
slowly
to
enjoy
and
analyse
the
*NL*
species
of
pleasure
brooding
for
me
in
the
hour
and
situation
.
It
was
*NL*
three
o'clock
;
the
church
bell
tolled
as
I
passed
under
the
belfry
:
the
*NL*
charm
of
the
hour
lay
in
its
approaching
dimness
,
in
the
low-gliding
and
*NL*
pale-beaming
sun
.
I
was
a
mile
from
Thornfield
,
in
a
lane
noted
for
wild
*NL*
roses
in
summer
,
for
nuts
and
blackberries
in
autumn
,
and
even
now
*NL*
possessing
a
few
coral
treasures
in
hips
and
haws
,
but
whose
best
winter
*NL*
delight
lay
in
its
utter
solitude
and
leafless
repose
.
If
a
breath
of
*NL*
air
stirred
,
it
made
no
sound
here
;
for
there
was
not
a
holly
,
not
an
*NL*
evergreen
to
rustle
,
and
the
stripped
hawthorn
and
hazel
bushes
were
as
*NL*
still
as
the
white
,
worn
stones
which
causewayed
the
middle
of
the
path
.
*NL*
Far
and
wide
,
on
each
side
,
there
were
only
fields
,
where
no
cattle
now
*NL*
browsed
;
and
the
little
brown
birds
,
which
stirred
occasionally
in
the
*NL*
hedge
,
looked
like
single
russet
leaves
that
had
forgotten
to
drop
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
lane
inclined
up-hill
all
the
way
to
Hay
;
having
reached
the
middle
,
*NL*
I
sat
down
on
a
stile
which
led
thence
into
a
field
.
Gathering
my
mantle
*NL*
about
me
,
and
sheltering
my
hands
in
my
muff
,
I
did
not
feel
the
cold
,
*NL*
though
it
froze
keenly
;
as
was
attested
by
a
sheet
of
ice
covering
the
*NL*
causeway
,
where
a
little
brooklet
,
now
congealed
,
had
overflowed
after
a
*NL*
rapid
thaw
some
days
since
.
From
my
seat
I
could
look
down
on
*NL*
Thornfield
:
the
grey
and
battlemented
hall
was
the
principal
object
in
*NL*
the
vale
below
me
;
its
woods
and
dark
rookery
rose
against
the
west
.
I
*NL*
lingered
till
the
sun
went
down
amongst
the
trees
,
and
sank
crimson
and
*NL*
clear
behind
them
.
I
then
turned
eastward
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
hill-top
above
me
sat
the
rising
moon
;
pale
yet
as
a
cloud
,
but
*NL*
brightening
momentarily
,
she
looked
over
Hay
,
which
,
half
lost
in
trees
,
*NL*
sent
up
a
blue
smoke
from
its
few
chimneys
:
it
was
yet
a
mile
distant
,
*NL*
but
in
the
absolute
hush
I
could
hear
plainly
its
thin
murmurs
of
life
.
*NL*
My
ear
,
too
,
felt
the
flow
of
currents
;
in
what
dales
and
depths
I
could
*NL*
not
tell
:
but
there
were
many
hills
beyond
Hay
,
and
doubtless
many
becks
*NL*
threading
their
passes
.
That
evening
calm
betrayed
alike
the
tinkle
of
*NL*
the
nearest
streams
,
the
sough
of
the
most
remote
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
rude
noise
broke
on
these
fine
ripplings
and
whisperings
,
at
once
so
*NL*
far
away
and
so
clear
:
a
positive
tramp
,
tramp
,
a
metallic
clatter
,
which
*NL*
effaced
the
soft
wave-wanderings
;
as
,
in
a
picture
,
the
solid
mass
of
a
*NL*
crag
,
or
the
rough
boles
of
a
great
oak
,
drawn
in
dark
and
strong
on
the
*NL*
foreground
,
efface
the
aerial
distance
of
azure
hill
,
sunny
horizon
,
and
*NL*
blended
clouds
where
tint
melts
into
tint
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
din
was
on
the
causeway
:
a
horse
was
coming
;
the
windings
of
the
lane
*NL*
yet
hid
it
,
but
it
approached
.
I
was
just
leaving
the
stile
;
yet
,
as
the
*NL*
path
was
narrow
,
I
sat
still
to
let
it
go
by
.
In
those
days
I
was
young
,
*NL*
and
all
sorts
of
fancies
bright
and
dark
tenanted
my
mind
:
the
memories
*NL*
of
nursery
stories
were
there
amongst
other
rubbish
;
and
when
they
*NL*
recurred
,
maturing
youth
added
to
them
a
vigour
and
vividness
beyond
what
*NL*
childhood
could
give
.
As
this
horse
approached
,
and
as
I
watched
for
it
*NL*
to
appear
through
the
dusk
,
I
remembered
certain
of
Bessie
's
tales
,
*NL*
wherein
figured
a
North-of-England
spirit
called
a
``
Gytrash
,
''
which
,
in
*NL*
the
form
of
horse
,
mule
,
or
large
dog
,
haunted
solitary
ways
,
and
*NL*
sometimes
came
upon
belated
travellers
,
as
this
horse
was
now
coming
upon
*NL*
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
very
near
,
but
not
yet
in
sight
;
when
,
in
addition
to
the
tramp
,
*NL*
tramp
,
I
heard
a
rush
under
the
hedge
,
and
close
down
by
the
hazel
stems
*NL*
glided
a
great
dog
,
whose
black
and
white
colour
made
him
a
distinct
*NL*
object
against
the
trees
.
It
was
exactly
one
form
of
Bessie
's
Gytrash
--
a
*NL*
lion-like
creature
with
long
hair
and
a
huge
head
:
it
passed
me
,
however
,
*NL*
quietly
enough
;
not
staying
to
look
up
,
with
strange
pretercanine
eyes
,
*NL*
in
my
face
,
as
I
half
expected
it
would
.
The
horse
followed
,
--
a
tall
*NL*
steed
,
and
on
its
back
a
rider
.
The
man
,
the
human
being
,
broke
the
*NL*
spell
at
once
.
Nothing
ever
rode
the
Gytrash
:
it
was
always
alone
;
and
*NL*
goblins
,
to
my
notions
,
though
they
might
tenant
the
dumb
carcasses
of
*NL*
beasts
,
could
scarce
covet
shelter
in
the
commonplace
human
form
.
No
*NL*
Gytrash
was
this
,
--
only
a
traveller
taking
the
short
cut
to
Millcote
.
He
*NL*
passed
,
and
I
went
on
;
a
few
steps
,
and
I
turned
:
a
sliding
sound
and
an
*NL*
exclamation
of
``
What
the
deuce
is
to
do
now
?
''
and
a
clattering
tumble
,
*NL*
arrested
my
attention
.
Man
and
horse
were
down
;
they
had
slipped
on
the
*NL*
sheet
of
ice
which
glazed
the
causeway
.
The
dog
came
bounding
back
,
and
*NL*
seeing
his
master
in
a
predicament
,
and
hearing
the
horse
groan
,
barked
*NL*
till
the
evening
hills
echoed
the
sound
,
which
was
deep
in
proportion
to
*NL*
his
magnitude
.
He
snuffed
round
the
prostrate
group
,
and
then
he
ran
up
*NL*
to
me
;
it
was
all
he
could
do
,
--
there
was
no
other
help
at
hand
to
*NL*
summon
.
I
obeyed
him
,
and
walked
down
to
the
traveller
,
by
this
time
*NL*
struggling
himself
free
of
his
steed
.
His
efforts
were
so
vigorous
,
I
*NL*
thought
he
could
not
be
much
hurt
;
but
I
asked
him
the
question
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
injured
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
think
he
was
swearing
,
but
am
not
certain
;
however
,
he
was
pronouncing
*NL*
some
formula
which
prevented
him
from
replying
to
me
directly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
I
do
anything
?
''
I
asked
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
just
stand
on
one
side
,
''
he
answered
as
he
rose
,
first
to
his
*NL*
knees
,
and
then
to
his
feet
.
I
did
;
whereupon
began
a
heaving
,
stamping
,
*NL*
clattering
process
,
accompanied
by
a
barking
and
baying
which
removed
me
*NL*
effectually
some
yards
'
distance
;
but
I
would
not
be
driven
quite
away
*NL*
till
I
saw
the
event
.
This
was
finally
fortunate
;
the
horse
was
*NL*
re-established
,
and
the
dog
was
silenced
with
a
``
Down
,
Pilot
!
''
The
*NL*
traveller
now
,
stooping
,
felt
his
foot
and
leg
,
as
if
trying
whether
they
*NL*
were
sound
;
apparently
something
ailed
them
,
for
he
halted
to
the
stile
*NL*
whence
I
had
just
risen
,
and
sat
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
in
the
mood
for
being
useful
,
or
at
least
officious
,
I
think
,
for
I
*NL*
now
drew
near
him
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
are
hurt
,
and
want
help
,
sir
,
I
can
fetch
some
one
either
from
*NL*
Thornfield
Hall
or
from
Hay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
:
I
shall
do
:
I
have
no
broken
bones
,
--
only
a
sprain
;
''
and
*NL*
again
he
stood
up
and
tried
his
foot
,
but
the
result
extorted
an
*NL*
involuntary
``
Ugh
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Something
of
daylight
still
lingered
,
and
the
moon
was
waxing
bright
:
I
*NL*
could
see
him
plainly
.
His
figure
was
enveloped
in
a
riding
cloak
,
fur
*NL*
collared
and
steel
clasped
;
its
details
were
not
apparent
,
but
I
traced
*NL*
the
general
points
of
middle
height
and
considerable
breadth
of
chest
.
He
*NL*
had
a
dark
face
,
with
stern
features
and
a
heavy
brow
;
his
eyes
and
*NL*
gathered
eyebrows
looked
ireful
and
thwarted
just
now
;
he
was
past
youth
,
*NL*
but
had
not
reached
middle-age
;
perhaps
he
might
be
thirty-five
.
I
felt
*NL*
no
fear
of
him
,
and
but
little
shyness
.
Had
he
been
a
handsome
,
heroic
-
*NL*
looking
young
gentleman
,
I
should
not
have
dared
to
stand
thus
*NL*
questioning
him
against
his
will
,
and
offering
my
services
unasked
.
I
*NL*
had
hardly
ever
seen
a
handsome
youth
;
never
in
my
life
spoken
to
one
.
I
*NL*
had
a
theoretical
reverence
and
homage
for
beauty
,
elegance
,
gallantry
,
*NL*
fascination
;
but
had
I
met
those
qualities
incarnate
in
masculine
shape
,
*NL*
I
should
have
known
instinctively
that
they
neither
had
nor
could
have
*NL*
sympathy
with
anything
in
me
,
and
should
have
shunned
them
as
one
would
*NL*
fire
,
lightning
,
or
anything
else
that
is
bright
but
antipathetic
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
even
this
stranger
had
smiled
and
been
good-humoured
to
me
when
I
*NL*
addressed
him
;
if
he
had
put
off
my
offer
of
assistance
gaily
and
with
*NL*
thanks
,
I
should
have
gone
on
my
way
and
not
felt
any
vocation
to
renew
*NL*
inquiries
:
but
the
frown
,
the
roughness
of
the
traveller
,
set
me
at
my
*NL*
ease
:
I
retained
my
station
when
he
waved
to
me
to
go
,
and
announced
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
think
of
leaving
you
,
sir
,
at
so
late
an
hour
,
in
this
solitary
*NL*
lane
,
till
I
see
you
are
fit
to
mount
your
horse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
me
when
I
said
this
;
he
had
hardly
turned
his
eyes
in
my
*NL*
direction
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
you
ought
to
be
at
home
yourself
,
''
said
he
,
``
if
you
have
*NL*
a
home
in
this
neighbourhood
:
where
do
you
come
from
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
just
below
;
and
I
am
not
at
all
afraid
of
being
out
late
when
it
is
*NL*
moonlight

I
will
run
over
to
Hay
for
you
with
pleasure
,
if
you
wish
it
:
*NL*
indeed
,
I
am
going
there
to
post
a
letter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
live
just
below
--
do
you
mean
at
that
house
with
the
battlements
?
''
*NL*
pointing
to
Thornfield
Hall
,
on
which
the
moon
cast
a
hoary
gleam
,
*NL*
bringing
it
out
distinct
and
pale
from
the
woods
that
,
by
contrast
with
*NL*
the
western
sky
,
now
seemed
one
mass
of
shadow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whose
house
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Rochester
's

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
Mr.
Rochester
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
have
never
seen
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
not
resident
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
tell
me
where
he
is
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
a
servant
at
the
hall
,
of
course
.
You
are
--
''
He
stopped
,
*NL*
ran
his
eye
over
my
dress
,
which
,
as
usual
,
was
quite
simple
:
a
black
*NL*
merino
cloak
,
a
black
beaver
bonnet
;
neither
of
them
half
fine
enough
for
*NL*
a
lady
's
-
maid
.
He
seemed
puzzled
to
decide
what
I
was
;
I
helped
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
the
governess
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
the
governess
!
''
he
repeated
;
``
deuce
take
me
,
if
I
had
not
forgotten
!
*NL*
The
governess
!
''
and
again
my
raiment
underwent
scrutiny
.
In
two
minutes
*NL*
he
rose
from
the
stile
:
his
face
expressed
pain
when
he
tried
to
move
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
commission
you
to
fetch
help
,
''
he
said
;
``
but
you
may
help
me
a
*NL*
little
yourself
,
if
you
will
be
so
kind
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
not
an
umbrella
that
I
can
use
as
a
stick
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Try
to
get
hold
of
my
horse

bridle

lead
him
to

?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
should
have
been
afraid
to
touch
a
horse
when
alone
,
but
when
told
to
*NL*
do
it
,
I
was
disposed
to
obey
.
I
put
down
my
muff
on
the
stile
,
and
went
*NL*
up
to
the
tall
steed
;
I
endeavoured
to
catch
the
bridle
,
but
it
was
a
*NL*
spirited
thing
,
and
would
not
let
me
come
near
its
head
;
I
made
effort
on
*NL*
effort
,
though
in
vain
:
meantime
,
I
was
mortally
afraid
of
its
trampling
*NL*
fore-feet
.
The
traveller
waited
and
watched
for
some
time
,
and
at
last
*NL*
he
laughed
.

*NL*
-LCB-
I
was
mortally
afraid

its
trampling
forefeet

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
,

he
said
,
``
the
mountain
will
never
be
brought
to
Mahomet
,
so
all
*NL*
you
can
do
is
to
aid

beg

I
came

``
Excuse

he
continued
:
``
necessity

me
to
make
you

He
laid
a
heavy
hand
on
my
shoulder
,
and
leaning
on
me
with
*NL*
some
stress
,
limped
to
his
horse
.
Having
once
caught
the
bridle
,
he
*NL*
mastered
it
directly
and
sprang
to
his
saddle
;
grimacing
grimly
as
he
*NL*
made
the
effort
,
for
it
wrenched
his
sprain

*NL*
*NL*
``
Now

''
said
he
,
releasing
his
under
lip
from
a
hard
bite
,
``
just
hand
me
*NL*
my
whip
;
it
lies
there
under
the
hedge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
sought
it
and
found
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
;
now
make
haste
with
the
letter
to
Hay
,
and
return
as
fast
as
*NL*
you
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
touch
of
a
spurred
heel
made
his
horse
first
start
and
rear
,
and
then
*NL*
bound
away
;
the
dog
rushed
in
his
traces
;
all
three
vanished
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
heath
that
,
in
the
wilderness
,
*NL*
The
wild
wind
whirls
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
up
my
muff
and
walked
on
.
The
incident
had
occurred
and
was
gone
*NL*
for
me
:
it
_
was
_
an
incident
of
no
moment
,
no
romance
,
no
interest
in
a
*NL*
sense
;
yet
it
marked
with
change
one
single
hour
of
a
monotonous
life
.
My
*NL*
help
had
been
needed
and
claimed
;
I
had
given
it
:
I
was
pleased
to
have
*NL*
done
something
;
trivial
,
transitory
though
the
deed
was
,
it
was
yet
an
*NL*
active
thing
,
and
I
was
weary
of
an
existence
all
passive
.
The
new
face
,
*NL*
too
,
was
like
a
new
picture
introduced
to
the
gallery
of
memory
;
and
it
*NL*
was
dissimilar
to
all
the
others
hanging
there
:
firstly
,
because
it
was
*NL*
masculine
;
and
,
secondly
,
because
it
was
dark
,
strong
,
and
stern
.
I
had
*NL*
it
still
before
me
when
I
entered
Hay
,
and
slipped
the
letter
into
the
*NL*
post-office
;
I
saw
it
as
I
walked
fast
down-hill
all
the
way
home
.
When
*NL*
I
came
to
the
stile
,
I
stopped
a
minute
,
looked
round
and
listened
,
with
*NL*
an
idea
that
a
horse
's
hoofs
might
ring
on
the
causeway
again
,
and
that
a
*NL*
rider
in
a
cloak
,
and
a
Gytrash-like
Newfoundland
dog
,
might
be
again
*NL*
apparent
:
I
saw
only
the
hedge
and
a
pollard
willow
before
me
,
rising
up
*NL*
still
and
straight
to
meet
the
moonbeams
;
I
heard
only
the
faintest
waft
*NL*
of
wind
roaming
fitful
among
the
trees
round
Thornfield
,
a
mile
distant
;
*NL*
and
when
I
glanced
down
in
the
direction
of
the
murmur
,
my
eye
,
*NL*
traversing
the
hall-front
,
caught
a
light
kindling
in
a
window
:
it
*NL*
reminded
me
that
I
was
late
,
and
I
hurried
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
not
like
re-entering
Thornfield
.
To
pass
its
threshold
was
to
*NL*
return
to
stagnation
;
to
cross
the
silent
hall
,
to
ascend
the
darksome
*NL*
staircase
,
to
seek
my
own
lonely
little
room
,
and
then
to
meet
tranquil
*NL*
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
and
spend
the
long
winter
evening
with
her
,
and
her
only
,
*NL*
was
to
quell
wholly
the
faint
excitement
wakened
by
my
walk
,
--
to
slip
*NL*
again
over
my
faculties
the
viewless
fetters
of
an
uniform
and
too
still
*NL*
existence
;
of
an
existence
whose
very
privileges
of
security
and
ease
I
*NL*
was
becoming
incapable
of
appreciating
.
What
good
it
would
have
done
me
*NL*
at
that
time
to
have
been
tossed
in
the
storms
of
an
uncertain
struggling
*NL*
life
,
and
to
have
been
taught
by
rough
and
bitter
experience
to
long
for
*NL*
the
calm
amidst
which
I
now
repined
!
Yes
,
just
as
much
good
as
it
would
*NL*
do
a
man
tired
of
sitting
still
in
a
``
too
easy
chair
''
to
take
a
long
*NL*
walk
:
and
just
as
natural
was
the
wish
to
stir
,
under
my
circumstances
,
*NL*
as
it
would
be
under
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
lingered
at
the
gates
;
I
lingered
on
the
lawn
;
I
paced
backwards
and
*NL*
forwards
on
the
pavement
;
the
shutters
of
the
glass
door
were
closed
;
I
*NL*
could
not
see
into
the
interior
;
and
both
my
eyes
and
spirit
seemed
drawn
*NL*
from
the
gloomy
house
--
from
the
grey-hollow
filled
with
rayless
cells
,
as
*NL*
it
appeared
to
me
--
to
that
sky
expanded
before
me
,
--
a
blue
sea
absolved
*NL*
from
taint
of
cloud
;
the
moon
ascending
it
in
solemn
march
;
her
orb
*NL*
seeming
to
look
up
as
she
left
the
hill-tops
,
from
behind
which
she
had
*NL*
come
,
far
and
farther
below
her
,
and
aspired
to
the
zenith
,
midnight
dark
*NL*
in
its
fathomless
depth
and
measureless
distance
;
and
for
those
trembling
*NL*
stars
that
followed
her
course
;
they
made
my
heart
tremble
,
my
veins
glow
*NL*
when
I
viewed
them
.
Little
things
recall
us
to
earth
;
the
clock
struck
*NL*
in
the
hall
;
that
sufficed
;
I
turned
from
moon
and
stars
,
opened
a
side
-
*NL*
door
,
and
went
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hall
was
not
dark
,
nor
yet
was
it
lit
,
only
by
the
high-hung
bronze
*NL*
lamp
;
a
warm
glow
suffused
both
it
and
the
lower
steps
of
the
oak
*NL*
staircase
.
This
ruddy
shine
issued
from
the
great
dining-room
,
whose
two
-
*NL*
leaved
door
stood
open
,
and
showed
a
genial
fire
in
the
grate
,
glancing
*NL*
on
marble
hearth
and
brass
fire-irons
,
and
revealing
purple
draperies
and
*NL*
polished
furniture
,
in
the
most
pleasant
radiance
.
It
revealed
,
too
,
a
*NL*
group
near
the
mantelpiece
:
I
had
scarcely
caught
it
,
and
scarcely
become
*NL*
aware
of
a
cheerful
mingling
of
voices
,
amongst
which
I
seemed
to
*NL*
distinguish
the
tones
of
Adele
,
when
the
door
closed
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
hastened
to
Mrs.
Fairfax
's
room
;
there
was
a
fire
there
too
,
but
no
*NL*
candle
,
and
no
Mrs.
Fairfax
.
Instead
,
all
alone
,
sitting
upright
on
the
*NL*
rug
,
and
gazing
with
gravity
at
the
blaze
,
I
beheld
a
great
black
and
*NL*
white
long-haired
dog
,
just
like
the
Gytrash
of
the
lane
.
It
was
so
like
*NL*
it
that
I
went
forward
and
said
--
``
Pilot
''
and
the
thing
got
up
and
came
to
*NL*
me
and
snuffed
me
.
I
caressed
him
,
and
he
wagged
his
great
tail
;
but
he
*NL*
looked
an
eerie
creature
to
be
alone
with
,
and
I
could
not
tell
whence
he
*NL*
had
come
.
I
rang
the
bell
,
for
I
wanted
a
candle
;
and
I
wanted
,
too
,
to
*NL*
get
an
account
of
this
visitant
.
Leah
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
dog
is
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
came

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
Leah
brought

she
entered
,
followed
by
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
who
repeated
the
*NL*
news
;
adding
that
Mr.
Carter
the
surgeon
was
come
,
and
was
now
with
Mr.
*NL*
Rochester
:
then
she
hurried
out
to
give
orders
about
tea
,
and
I
went
*NL*
upstairs
to
take
off
my
things
.

CHAPTER
XIII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Rochester
,
it
seems
,
by
the
surgeon
's
orders
,
went
to
bed
early
that
*NL*
night
;
nor
did
he
rise
soon
next
morning
.
When
he
did
come
down
,
it
was
*NL*
to
attend
to
business
:
his
agent
and
some
of
his
tenants
were
arrived
,
*NL*
and
waiting
to
speak
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Adele
and
I
had
now
to
vacate
the
library
:
it
would
be
in
daily
*NL*
requisition
as
a
reception-room
for
callers
.
A
fire
was
lit
in
an
*NL*
apartment
upstairs
,
and
there
I
carried
our
books
,
and
arranged
it
for
*NL*
the
future
schoolroom
.
I
discerned
in
the
course
of
the
morning
that
*NL*
Thornfield
Hall
was
a
changed
place
:
no
longer
silent
as
a
church
,
it
*NL*
echoed
every
hour
or
two
to
a
knock
at
the
door
,
or
a
clang
of
the
bell
;
*NL*
steps
,
too
,
often
traversed
the
hall
,
and
new
voices
spoke
in
different
*NL*
keys
below
;
a
rill
from
the
outer
world
was
flowing
through
it
;
it
had
a
*NL*
master
:
for
my
part
,
I
liked
it
better
.
*NL*
*NL*
Adele
was
not
easy
to
teach
that
day
;
she
could
not
apply
:
she
kept
*NL*
running
to
the
door
and
looking
over
the
banisters
to
see
if
she
could
*NL*
get
a
glimpse
of
Mr.
Rochester
;
then
she
coined
pretexts
to
go
*NL*
downstairs
,
in
order
,
as
I
shrewdly
suspected
,
to
visit
the
library
,
*NL*
where
I
knew
she
was
not
wanted
;
then
,
when
I
got
a
little
angry
,
and
*NL*
made
her
sit
still
,
she
continued
to
talk
incessantly
of
her
``
ami
,
*NL*
Monsieur
Edouard
Fairfax
_
de
_
Rochester
,
''
as
she
dubbed
him
-LRB-
I
had
not
*NL*
before
heard
his
prenomens
-RRB-
,
and
to
conjecture
what
presents
he
had
*NL*
brought
her
:
for
it
appears
he
had
intimated
the
night
before
,
that
when
*NL*
his
luggage
came
from
Millcote
,
there
would
be
found
amongst
it
a
little
*NL*
box
in
whose
contents
she
had
an
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Et
cela
doit
signifier
,
''
said
she
,
``
qu'il
y
aura
la
dedans
un
cadeau
*NL*
pour
moi
,
et
peut-etre
pour
vous
aussi
,
mademoiselle
.
Monsieur
a
parle
*NL*
de
vous
:
il
m
'
a
demande
le
nom
de
ma
gouvernante
,
et
si
elle
n'etait
pas
*NL*
une
petite
personne
,
assez
mince
et
un
peu
pale
.
J'ai
dit
qu'oui
:
car
*NL*
c'est
vrai
,
n'est
-
ce
pas
,
mademoiselle
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
and
my
pupil
dined
as
usual
in
Mrs.
Fairfax
's
parlour
;
the
afternoon
*NL*
was
wild
and
snowy
,
and
we
passed
it
in
the
schoolroom
.
At
dark
I
*NL*
allowed
Adele
to
put
away
books
and
work
,
and
to
run
downstairs
;
for
,
*NL*
from
the
comparative
silence
below
,
and
from
the
cessation
of
appeals
to
*NL*
the
door-bell
,
I
conjectured
that
Mr.
Rochester
was
now
at
liberty
.
Left
*NL*
alone
,
I
walked
to
the
window
;
but
nothing
was
to
be
seen
thence
:
*NL*
twilight
and
snowflakes
together
thickened
the
air
,
and
hid
the
very
*NL*
shrubs
on
the
lawn
.
I
let
down
the
curtain
and
went
back
to
the
*NL*
fireside
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
clear
embers
I
was
tracing
a
view
,
not
unlike
a
picture
I
*NL*
remembered
to
have
seen
of
the
castle
of
Heidelberg
,
on
the
Rhine
,
when
*NL*
Mrs.
Fairfax
came
in
,
breaking
up
by
her
entrance
the
fiery
mosaic
I
had
*NL*
been
piercing
together
,
and
scattering
too
some
heavy
unwelcome
thoughts
*NL*
that
were
beginning
to
throng
on
my
solitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Rochester
would
be
glad
if
you
and
your
pupil
would
take
tea
with
*NL*
him
in
the
drawing-room
this
evening
,
''
said
she
:
``
he
has
been
so
much
*NL*
engaged
all
day
that
he
could
not
ask
to
see
you
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
is
his
tea-time
?
''
I
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
at
six
o'clock
:
he
keeps
early
hours
in
the
country
.
You
had
better
*NL*
change
your
frock
now
;
I
will
go
with
you
and
fasten
it
.
Here
is
a
*NL*
candle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
necessary
to
change
my
frock
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
had
better
:
I
always
dress
for
the
evening
when
Mr.
Rochester
*NL*
is
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
additional
ceremony
seemed
somewhat
stately
;
however
,
I
repaired
to
*NL*
my
room
,
and
,
with
Mrs.
Fairfax
's
aid
,
replaced
my
black
stuff
dress
by
*NL*
one
of
black
silk
;
the
best
and
the
only
additional
one
I
had
,
except
one
*NL*
of
light
grey
,
which
,
in
my
Lowood
notions
of
the
toilette
,
I
thought
too
*NL*
fine
to
be
worn
,
except
on
first-rate
occasions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
want
a
brooch
,
''
said
Mrs.
Fairfax
.
I
had
a
single
little
pearl
*NL*
ornament
which
Miss
Temple
gave
me
as
a
parting
keepsake
:
I
put
it
on
,
*NL*
and
then
we
went
downstairs
.
Unused
as
I
was
to
strangers
,
it
was
rather
*NL*
a
trial
to
appear
thus
formally
summoned
in
Mr.
Rochester
's
presence
.
I
*NL*
let
Mrs.
Fairfax
precede
me
into
the
dining-room
,
and
kept
in
her
shade
*NL*
as
we
crossed
that
apartment
;
and
,
passing
the
arch
,
whose
curtain
was
*NL*
now
dropped
,
entered
the
elegant
recess
beyond
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
wax
candles
stood
lighted
on
the
table
,
and
two
on
the
mantelpiece
;
*NL*
basking
in
the
light
and
heat
of
a
superb
fire
,
lay
Pilot
--
Adele
knelt
*NL*
near
him
.
Half
reclined
on
a
couch
appeared
Mr.
Rochester
,
his
foot
*NL*
supported
by
the
cushion
;
he
was
looking
at
Adele
and
the
dog
:
the
fire
*NL*
shone
full
on
his
face
.
I
knew
my
traveller
with
his
broad
and
jetty
*NL*
eyebrows
;
his
square
forehead
,
made
squarer
by
the
horizontal
sweep
of
*NL*
his
black
hair
.
I
recognised
his
decisive
nose
,
more
remarkable
for
*NL*
character
than
beauty
;
his
full
nostrils
,
denoting
,
I
thought
,
choler
;
*NL*
his
grim
mouth
,
chin
,
and
jaw
--
yes
,
all
three
were
very
grim
,
and
no
*NL*
mistake
.
His
shape
,
now
divested
of
cloak
,
I
perceived
harmonised
in
*NL*
squareness
with
his
physiognomy
:
I
suppose
it
was
a
good
figure
in
the
*NL*
athletic
sense
of
the
term
--
broad
chested
and
thin
flanked
,
though
*NL*
neither
tall
nor
graceful
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Rochester
must
have
been
aware
of
the
entrance
of
Mrs.
Fairfax
and
*NL*
myself
;
but
it
appeared
he
was
not
in
the
mood
to
notice
us
,
for
he
never
*NL*
lifted
his
head
as
we
approached
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
is
Miss
Eyre
,
sir
,
''
said
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
in
her
quiet
way
.
He
bowed
,
*NL*
still
not
taking
his
eyes
from
the
group
of
the
dog
and
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
Miss
Eyre
be
seated
,
''
said
he
:
and
there
was
something
in
the
forced
*NL*
stiff
bow
,
in
the
impatient
yet
formal
tone
,
which
seemed
further
to
*NL*
express
,
``
What
the
deuce
is
it
to
me
whether
Miss
Eyre
be
there
or
not
?
*NL*
At
this
moment
I
am
not
disposed
to
accost
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
sat
down
quite
disembarrassed
.
A
reception
of
finished
politeness
*NL*
would
probably
have
confused
me
:
I
could
not
have
returned
or
repaid
it
*NL*
by
answering
grace
and
elegance
on
my
part
;
but
harsh
caprice
laid
me
*NL*
under
no
obligation
;
on
the
contrary
,
a
decent
quiescence
,
under
the
*NL*
freak
of
manner
,
gave
me
the
advantage
.
Besides
,
the
eccentricity
of
the
*NL*
proceeding
was
piquant
:
I
felt
interested
to
see
how
he
would
go
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
on
as
a
statue
would
,
that
is
,
he
neither
spoke
nor
moved
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Fairfax
seemed
to
think
it
necessary
that
some
one
should
be
amiable
,
and
*NL*
she
began
to
talk
.
Kindly
,
as
usual
--
and
,
as
usual
,
rather
trite
--
she
*NL*
condoled
with
him
on
the
pressure
of
business
he
had
had
all
day
;
on
the
*NL*
annoyance
it
must
have
been
to
him
with
that
painful
sprain
:
then
she
*NL*
commended
his
patience
and
perseverance
in
going
through
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madam
,
I
should
like
some
tea
,
''
was
the
sole
rejoinder
she
got
.
She
*NL*
hastened
to
ring
the
bell
;
and
when
the
tray
came
,
she
proceeded
to
*NL*
arrange
the
cups
,
spoons
,
&
c.
,
with
assiduous
celerity
.
I
and
Adele
went
*NL*
to
the
table
;
but
the
master
did
not
leave
his
couch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
hand
Mr.
Rochester
's
cup
?
''
said
Mrs.
Fairfax
to
me
;
``
Adele
*NL*
might
perhaps
spill
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
as
requested
.
As
he
took
the
cup
from
my
hand
,
Adele
,
thinking
the
*NL*
moment
propitious
for
making
a
request
in
my
favour
,
cried
out
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
N'est

*NL*
*NL*

gruffly

he
searched
my
face
with
eyes

saw
were
dark

irate

piercing

*NL*
*NL*

acceptance

a

many
faces

one
should
consider
all

pronouncing
an
opinion

its

nature

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss

you
are
not
so
unsophisticated

Adele

she
demands

clamorously
,
the
moment
she
sees
me
:
you
beat
about
the
bush

*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
have
less
confidence

Adele
has

the
right
too
of
custom
;
for
*NL*
she
says
you
have
always
been
in
the
habit

giving
her
playthings
;
but
*NL*
if
I
had
to
make
out
a
case
I
should
be
puzzled

I
am
a
stranger

have
done
nothing

entitle

acknowledgment

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Humph

''
said
Mr.

,
and
he
took
his
tea
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
to
the
fire

said
the
master
,
when
the
tray
was
taken
away
,
and
*NL*
Mrs.
Fairfax
had
settled
into
a
corner
with
her
knitting
;
while
Adele
was
*NL*
leading
me
by
the
hand
round
the
room
,
showing
me
the
beautiful
books
and
*NL*
ornaments
on
the
consoles
and
chiffonnieres
.
We
obeyed
,
as
in
duty
*NL*
bound
;
Adele
wanted
to
take
a
seat
on
my
knee
,
but
she
was
ordered
to
*NL*
amuse
herself
with
Pilot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

have
done
up
any

No

you
have
*NL*
rather
the
look

another

I
marvelled
where
you
had
got
that

sort
of
face

When
you
came
on
me
in
Hay
Lane
last
night

I
thought
*NL*
unaccountably
of
fairy
tales

had
half
a

demand

bewitched

not

*NL*
``
No

thought
not

*NL*
*NL*
``
For

*NL*
*NL*

For

*NL*
I
shook
my
head

not

*NL*
Mrs.

had
dropped
her
knitting

,
with
raised
eyebrows

seemed

wondering
what

this
was

*NL*
``
Well

resumed
Mr.

the

two

*NL*
He
spread
the
pictures
before
him
,
and
again
surveyed
them
alternately
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
he
is
so
occupied
,
I
will
tell
you
,
reader
,
what
they
are
:
and
*NL*
first
,
I
must
premise
that
they
are
nothing
wonderful
.
The
subjects
had
,
*NL*
indeed
,
risen
vividly
on
my
mind
.
As
I
saw
them
with
the
spiritual
eye
,
*NL*
before
I
attempted
to
embody
them
,
they
were
striking
;
but
my
hand
would
*NL*
not
second
my
fancy
,
and
in
each
case
it
had
wrought
out
but
a
pale
*NL*
portrait
of
the
thing
I
had
conceived
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
pictures
were
in
water-colours
.
The
first
represented
clouds
low
*NL*
and
livid
,
rolling
over
a
swollen
sea
:
all
the
distance
was
in
eclipse
;
*NL*
so
,
too
,
was
the
foreground
;
or
rather
,
the
nearest
billows
,
for
there
*NL*
was
no
land
.
One
gleam
of
light
lifted
into
relief
a
half-submerged
*NL*
mast
,
on
which
sat
a
cormorant
,
dark
and
large
,
with
wings
flecked
with
*NL*
foam
;
its
beak
held
a
gold
bracelet
set
with
gems
,
that
I
had
touched
*NL*
with
as
brilliant
tints
as
my
palette
could
yield
,
and
as
glittering
*NL*
distinctness
as
my
pencil
could
impart
.
Sinking
below
the
bird
and
mast
,
*NL*
a
drowned
corpse
glanced
through
the
green
water
;
a
fair
arm
was
the
only
*NL*
limb
clearly
visible
,
whence
the
bracelet
had
been
washed
or
torn
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
second
picture
contained
for
foreground
only
the
dim
peak
of
a
hill
,
*NL*
with
grass
and
some
leaves
slanting
as
if
by
a
breeze
.
Beyond
and
above
*NL*
spread
an
expanse
of
sky
,
dark
blue
as
at
twilight
:
rising
into
the
sky
*NL*
was
a
woman
's
shape
to
the
bust
,
portrayed
in
tints
as
dusk
and
soft
as
I
*NL*
could
combine
.
The
dim
forehead
was
crowned
with
a
star
;
the
lineaments
*NL*
below
were
seen
as
through
the
suffusion
of
vapour
;
the
eyes
shone
dark
*NL*
and
wild
;
the
hair
streamed
shadowy
,
like
a
beamless
cloud
torn
by
storm
*NL*
or
by
electric
travail
.
On
the
neck
lay
a
pale
reflection
like
*NL*
moonlight
;
the
same
faint
lustre
touched
the
train
of
thin
clouds
from
*NL*
which
rose
and
bowed
this
vision
of
the
Evening
Star
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
third
showed
the
pinnacle
of
an
iceberg
piercing
a
polar
winter
sky
:
*NL*
a
muster
of
northern
lights
reared
their
dim
lances
,
close
serried
,
along
*NL*
the
horizon
.
Throwing
these
into
distance
,
rose
,
in
the
foreground
,
a
*NL*
head
,
--
a
colossal
head
,
inclined
towards
the
iceberg
,
and
resting
against
*NL*
it
.
Two
thin
hands
,
joined
under
the
forehead
,
and
supporting
it
,
drew
*NL*
up
before
the
lower
features
a
sable
veil
,
a
brow
quite
bloodless
,
white
*NL*
as
bone
,
and
an
eye
hollow
and
fixed
,
blank
of
meaning
but
for
the
*NL*
glassiness
of
despair
,
alone
were
visible
.
Above
the
temples
,
amidst
*NL*
wreathed
turban
folds
of
black
drapery
,
vague
in
its
character
and
*NL*
consistency
as
cloud
,
gleamed
a
ring
of
white
flame
,
gemmed
with
sparkles
*NL*
of
a
more
lurid
tinge
.
This
pale
crescent
was
``
the
likeness
of
a
kingly
*NL*
crown
;
''
what
it
diademed
was
``
the
shape
which
shape
had
none
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Were
you
happy
when
you
painted
these
pictures
?
''
asked
Mr.
Rochester
*NL*
presently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
absorbed
,
sir
:
yes
,
and
I
was
happy
.
To
paint
them
,
in
short
,
was
*NL*
to
enjoy
one
of
the
keenest
pleasures
I
have
ever
known
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
not
saying
much
.
Your
pleasures
,
by
your
own
account
,
have
been
*NL*
few
;
but
I
daresay
you
did
exist
in
a
kind
of
artist
's
dreamland
while
*NL*
you
blent
and
arranged
these
strange
tints
.
Did
you
sit
at
them
long
*NL*
each
day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
nothing
else
to
do
,
because
it
was
the
vacation
,
and
I
sat
at
them
*NL*
from
morning
till
noon
,
and
from
noon
till
night
:
the
length
of
the
*NL*
midsummer
days
favoured
my
inclination
to
apply
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
felt
self-satisfied
with
the
result
of
your
ardent
labours
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Far
from
it
.
I
was
tormented
by
the
contrast
between
my
idea
and
my
*NL*
handiwork
:
in
each
case
I
had
imagined
something
which
I
was
quite
*NL*
powerless
to
realise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
quite
:
you
have
secured
the
shadow
of
your
thought
;
but
no
more

*NL*
probably
.
You
had
not
enough
of
the
artist
's
skill
and
science
to
give
*NL*
it
full
being
:
yet
the
drawings
are
,
for
a
school-girl
,
peculiar
.
As
to
*NL*
the
thoughts
,
they
are
elfish
.
These
eyes
in
the
Evening
Star
you
must
*NL*
have
seen
in
a
dream

How
could
you
make
them
look
so
clear

yet
not
*NL*
at
all
brilliant
?
for
the
planet
above
quells
their
rays

a
high
gale

*NL*
*NL*
I
had
scarce
tied
the
strings
of
the
portfolio
,
when
,
looking
at
his
*NL*
watch
,
he
said
abruptly
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
nine
o'clock
:
what
are
you
about

Miss
Eyre
,
to
let
Adele
sit
up
*NL*
so
long
?
Take
her
to
bed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adele
went
to
kiss
him
before
quitting
the
room
:
he
endured
the
caress
,
*NL*
but
scarcely
seemed
to
relish
it
more
than
Pilot
would
have
done
,
nor
so
*NL*
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
you
all
good-night
,
now
,
''
said
he
,
making
a
movement
of
the
hand
*NL*
towards
the
door
,
in
token
that
he
was
tired
of
our
company
,
and
wished
*NL*
to
dismiss
us
.
Mrs.
Fairfax
folded
up
her
knitting
:
I
took
my
portfolio
:
*NL*
we
curtseyed
to
him
,
received
a
frigid
bow
in
return
,
and
so
withdrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
said
Mr.
Rochester
was
not
strikingly
peculiar

I
*NL*
observed
,
when
I
rejoined
her
in
her
room
,
after
putting
Adele
to
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

is
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
so

very
changeful

abrupt

*NL*
*NL*
``
True
:
no
doubt
he
may
appear
so
to
a
stranger

I
am
so
accustomed

his
manner

I
never
think

it

then
,
if
he
has
peculiarities
of
*NL*
temper

allowance
should
be
made
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Partly
because
it
is
his
nature

we
can
none
of

help

*NL*

partly
because
he
has
painful
thoughts

no
doubt
,
to
harass
him
,
and
*NL*
make
his
spirits
unequal

``
What
about
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Family
troubles

for
one
thing

``
But
he
has
no
family

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
now

relatives

a
few
years
since

*NL*
*NL*
``
His

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

The
present
Mr.
Rochester
has
not
been
very
long
in
possession
of
*NL*
the
property
;
only
about
nine
years
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nine
years
is
a
tolerable
time
.
Was
he
so
very
fond
of
his
brother
as
*NL*
to
be
still
inconsolable
for
his
loss
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
no
--
perhaps
not
.
I
believe
there
were
some
misunderstandings
*NL*
between
them
.
Mr.
Rowland
Rochester
was
not
quite
just
to
Mr.
Edward
;
*NL*
and
perhaps
he
prejudiced
his
father
against
him
.
The
old
gentleman
was
*NL*
fond
of
money
,
and
anxious
to
keep
the
family
estate
together
.
He
did
*NL*
not
like
to
diminish
the
property
by
division
,
and
yet
he
was
anxious
*NL*
that
Mr.
Edward
should
have
wealth
,
too
,
to
keep
up
the
consequence
of
*NL*
the
name
;
and
,
soon
after
he
was
of
age
,
some
steps
were
taken
that
were
*NL*
not
quite
fair
,
and
made
a
great
deal
of
mischief
.
Old
Mr.
Rochester
and
*NL*
Mr.
Rowland
combined
to
bring
Mr.
Edward
into
what
he
considered
a
*NL*
painful
position
,
for
the
sake
of
making
his
fortune
:
what
the
precise
*NL*
nature
of
that
position
was
I
never
clearly
knew
,
but
his
spirit
could
*NL*
not
brook
what
he
had
to
suffer
in
it
.
He
is
not
very
forgiving
:
he
*NL*
broke
with
his
family
,
and
now
for
many
years
he
has
led
an
unsettled
*NL*
kind
of
life
.
I
do
n't
think
he
has
ever
been
resident
at
Thornfield
for
*NL*
a
fortnight
together
,
since
the
death
of
his
brother
without
a
will
left
*NL*
him
master
of
the
estate
;
and
,
indeed
,
no
wonder
he
shuns
the
old
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
he
shun
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
he
thinks
it
gloomy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
answer
was
evasive
.
I
should
have
liked
something
clearer
;
but
Mrs.
*NL*
Fairfax
either
could
not
,
or
would
not
,
give
me
more
explicit
information
*NL*
of
the
origin
and
nature
of
Mr.
Rochester
's
trials
.
She
averred
they
*NL*
were
a
mystery
to
herself
,
and
that
what
she
knew
was
chiefly
from
*NL*
conjecture
.
It
was
evident
,
indeed
,
that
she
wished
me
to
drop
the
*NL*
subject
,
which
I
did
accordingly
.

CHAPTER
XIV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
For
several
subsequent
days
I
saw
little
of
Mr.
Rochester
.
In
the
*NL*
mornings
he
seemed
much
engaged
with
business
,
and
,
in
the
afternoon
,
*NL*
gentlemen
from
Millcote
or
the
neighbourhood
called
,
and
sometimes
stayed
*NL*
to
dine
with
him
.
When
his
sprain
was
well
enough
to
admit
of
horse
*NL*
exercise
,
he
rode
out
a
good
deal
;
probably
to
return
these
visits
,
as
he
*NL*
generally
did
not
come
back
till
late
at
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
this
interval
,
even
Adele
was
seldom
sent
for
to
his
presence
,
and
*NL*
all
my
acquaintance
with
him
was
confined
to
an
occasional
rencontre
in
*NL*
the
hall
,
on
the
stairs
,
or
in
the
gallery
,
when
he
would
sometimes
pass
*NL*
me
haughtily
and
coldly
,
just
acknowledging
my
presence
by
a
distant
nod
*NL*
or
a
cool
glance
,
and
sometimes
bow
and
smile
with
gentlemanlike
*NL*
affability
.
His
changes
of
mood
did
not
offend
me
,
because
I
saw
that
I
*NL*
had
nothing
to
do
with
their
alternation
;
the
ebb
and
flow
depended
on
*NL*
causes
quite
disconnected
with
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
he
had
had
company
to
dinner
,
and
had
sent
for
my
portfolio
;
in
*NL*
order
,
doubtless
,
to
exhibit
its
contents
:
the
gentlemen
went
away
early
,
*NL*
to
attend
a
public
meeting
at
Millcote
,
as
Mrs.
Fairfax
informed
me
;
but
*NL*
the
night
being
wet
and
inclement
,
Mr.
Rochester
did
not
accompany
them
.
*NL*
Soon
after
they
were
gone
he
rang
the
bell
:
a
message
came
that
I
and
*NL*
Adele
were
to
go
downstairs
.
I
brushed
Adele
's
hair
and
made
her
neat
,
*NL*
and
having
ascertained
that
I
was
myself
in
my
usual
Quaker
trim
,
where
*NL*
there
was
nothing
to
retouch
--
all
being
too
close
and
plain
,
braided
*NL*
locks
included
,
to
admit
of
disarrangement
--
we
descended
,
Adele
wondering
*NL*
whether
the
_
petit
coffre
_
was
at
length
come
;
for
,
owing
to
some
*NL*
mistake
,
its
arrival
had
hitherto
been
delayed
.
She
was
gratified
:
there
*NL*
it
stood
,
a
little
carton
,
on
the
table
when
we
entered
the
dining-room
.
*NL*
She
appeared
to
know
it
by
instinct
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ma
boite
!
ma
boite
!
''
exclaimed
she
,
running
towards
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
there
is
your
`
boite
'
at
last
:
take
it
into
a
corner
,
you
genuine
*NL*
daughter
of
Paris
,
and
amuse
yourself
with
disembowelling
it
,
''
said
the
*NL*
deep
and
rather
sarcastic
voice
of
Mr.
Rochester
,
proceeding
from
the
*NL*
depths
of
an
immense
easy-chair
at
the
fireside
.
``
And
mind
,
''
he
*NL*
continued
,
``
do
n't
bother
me
with
any
details
of
the
anatomical
process
,
*NL*
or
any
notice
of
the
condition
of
the
entrails
:
let
your
operation
be
*NL*
conducted
in
silence
:
tiens-toi
tranquille
,
enfant
;
comprends-tu
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adele
seemed
scarcely
to
need
the
warning
--
she
had
already
retired
to
a
*NL*
sofa
with
her
treasure
,
and
was
busy
untying
the
cord
which
secured
the
*NL*
lid
.
Having
removed
this
impediment
,
and
lifted
certain
silvery
*NL*
envelopes
of
tissue
paper
,
she
merely
exclaimed
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
ciel
!
Que
c'est
beau
!
''
and
then
remained
absorbed
in
ecstatic
*NL*
contemplation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Miss
Eyre
there
?
''
now
demanded
the
master
,
half
rising
from
his
seat
*NL*
to
look
round
to
the
door
,
near
which
I
still
stood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
well
,
come
forward

be
seated
here

He
drew
a
chair
near
his
own
.
*NL*
``
I
am
not
fond
of
the
prattle
of
children
,
''
he
continued
;
``
for
,
old
*NL*
bachelor
as
I
am
,
I
have
no
pleasant
associations
connected
with
their

It
would
be
intolerable
to
me
to
pass
a
whole
evening
*NL*
_
tete-a-tete
_
with
a
brat
.
Do
n't
draw
that
chair
farther
off
,
Miss
Eyre

down
exactly
where
I
placed
it

if
you

*NL*
these

I
continually
forget
them

Nor
do
I
particularly
*NL*
affect
simple-minded
old

By-the-bye

I
must
have
mine
in

*NL*
it
wo
n't
do
to
neglect
her

a
Fairfax

wed
to
one

thicker
than

*NL*
*NL*
He
rang
,
and
despatched
an
invitation
to
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
who
soon
arrived
,
*NL*
knitting-basket
in
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
evening
,
madam
;
I
sent
to
you
for
a
charitable
purpose

I
have
*NL*
forbidden
Adele
to
talk
to
me
about
her
presents
,
and
she
is
bursting
*NL*
with
repletion
:
have
the
goodness
to
serve
her
as
auditress
and
*NL*
interlocutrice
;
it
will
be
one
of
the
most
benevolent
acts
you
ever
*NL*
performed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adele
,
indeed
,
no
sooner
saw
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
than
she
summoned
her
to
her
*NL*
sofa
,
and
there
quickly
filled
her
lap
with
the
porcelain
,
the
ivory
,
the
*NL*
waxen
contents
of
her
``
boite
;
''
pouring
out
,
meantime
,
explanations
and
*NL*
raptures
in
such
broken
English
as
she
was
mistress
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
I
have
performed
the
part
of
a
good

pursued
Mr.
Rochester
,
*NL*
``

my

Miss
Eyre
,
draw
your
chair
still
a
*NL*
little
farther
forward
:
you
are
yet
too
far
back
;
I
can
not
see
you
*NL*
without
disturbing
my
position
in
this
comfortable
chair
,
which
I
have
no
*NL*
mind
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
as
I
was
bid
,
though
I
would
much
rather
have
remained
somewhat
in
*NL*
the
shade
;
but
Mr.
Rochester
had
such
a
direct
way
of
giving
orders
,
it
*NL*
seemed
a
matter
of
course
to
obey
him
promptly
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
,
as
I
have
said
,
in
the
dining-room
:
the
lustre
,
which
had
been
*NL*
lit
for
dinner
,
filled
the
room
with
a
festal
breadth
of
light
;
the
large
*NL*
fire
was
all
red
and
clear
;
the
purple
curtains
hung
rich
and
ample
*NL*
before
the
lofty
window
and
loftier
arch
;
everything
was
still
,
save
the
*NL*
subdued
chat
of
Adele
-LRB-
she
dared
not
speak
loud
-RRB-
,
and
,
filling
up
each
*NL*
pause
,
the
beating
of
winter
rain
against
the
panes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Rochester
,
as
he
sat
in
his
damask-covered
chair
,
looked
different
to
*NL*
what
I
had
seen
him
look
before
;
not
quite
so
stern
--
much
less
gloomy
.
*NL*
There
was
a
smile
on
his
lips
,
and
his
eyes
sparkled
,
whether
with
wine
*NL*
or
not
,
I
am
not
sure
;
but
I
think
it
very
probable
.
He
was
,
in
short
,
*NL*
in
his
after-dinner
mood
;
more
expanded
and
genial
,
and
also
more
self
-
*NL*
indulgent
than
the
frigid
and
rigid
temper
of
the
morning
;
still
he
*NL*
looked
preciously
grim
,
cushioning
his
massive
head
against
the
swelling
*NL*
back
of
his
chair
,
and
receiving
the
light
of
the
fire
on
his
granite
-
*NL*
hewn
features
,
and
in
his
great
,
dark
eyes
;
for
he
had
great
,
dark
eyes
,
*NL*
and
very
fine
eyes
,
too
--
not
without
a
certain
change
in
their
depths
*NL*
sometimes
,
which
,
if
it
was
not
softness
,
reminded
you
,
at
least
,
of
that
*NL*
feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
been
looking
two
minutes
at
the
fire
,
and
I
had
been
looking
the
*NL*
same
length
of
time
at
him
,
when
,
turning
suddenly
,
he
caught
my
gaze
*NL*
fastened
on
his
physiognomy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
examine
me
,
Miss
Eyre
,
''
said
he
:
``
do
you
think
me
handsome
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
should
,
if
I
had
deliberated
,
have
replied
to
this
question
by
*NL*
something
conventionally
vague
and
polite
;
but
the
answer
somehow
slipped
*NL*
from
my
tongue
before
I
was
aware
--
``
No
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
By
my
word
!
there
is
something
singular
about
you
,
''
said
he
:
``
you
*NL*
have
the
air
of
a
little
_
nonnette
_
;
quaint
,
quiet
,
grave
,
and
simple
,
as
*NL*
you
sit
with
your
hands
before
you
,
and
your
eyes
generally
bent
on
the
*NL*
carpet
-LRB-
except
,
by-the-bye
,
when
they
are
directed
piercingly
to
my
face
;
*NL*
as
just
now
,
for
instance
-RRB-
;
and
when
one
asks
you
a
question
,
or
makes
a
*NL*
remark
to
which
you
are
obliged
to
reply
,
you
rap
out
a
round
rejoinder
,
*NL*
which
,
if
not
blunt
,
is
at
least
brusque
.
What
do
you
mean
by
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
I
was
too
plain
;
I
beg
your
pardon
.
I
ought
to
have
replied
that
*NL*
it
was
not
easy
to
give
an
impromptu
answer
to
a
question
about
*NL*
appearances
;
that
tastes
mostly
differ
;
and
that
beauty
is
of
little
*NL*
consequence
,
or
something
of
that
sort
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ought
to
have
replied
no
such
thing
.
Beauty
of
little
consequence
,
*NL*
indeed
!
And
so
,
under
pretence
of
softening
the
previous
outrage
,
of
*NL*
stroking
and
soothing
me
into
placidity
,
you
stick
a
sly
penknife
under
*NL*
my
ear
!
Go
on
:
what
fault
do
you
find
with
me
,
pray
?
I
suppose
I
have
*NL*
all
my
limbs
and
all
my
features
like
any
other
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Rochester
,
allow
me
to
disown
my
first
answer
:
I
intended
no
pointed
*NL*
repartee
:
it
was
only
a
blunder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
so
:
I
think
so
:
and
you
shall
be
answerable
for
it
.
Criticise
me
:
*NL*
does
my
forehead
not
please
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
lifted
up
the
sable
waves
of
hair
which
lay
horizontally
over
his
*NL*
brow
,
and
showed
a
solid
enough
mass
of
intellectual
organs
,
but
an
*NL*
abrupt
deficiency
where
the
suave
sign
of
benevolence
should
have
risen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
ma'am
,
am
I
a
fool
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Far
from
it
,
sir
.
You
would
,
perhaps
,
think
me
rude
if
I
inquired
in
*NL*
return
whether
you
are
a
philanthropist
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
again
!
Another
stick
of
the
penknife
,
when
she
pretended
to
pat
*NL*
my
head
:
and
that
is
because
I
said
I
did
not
like
the
society
of
*NL*
children
and
old
women
-LRB-
low
be
it
spoken
!
-RRB-
.
No
,
young
lady
,
I
am
not
a
*NL*
general
philanthropist
;
but
I
bear
a
conscience
;
''
and
he
pointed
to
the
*NL*
prominences
which
are
said
to
indicate
that
faculty
,
and
which
,
*NL*
fortunately
for
him
,
were
sufficiently
conspicuous
;
giving
,
indeed
,
a
*NL*
marked
breadth
to
the
upper
part
of
his
head
:
``
and
,
besides
,
I
once
had
a
*NL*
kind
of
rude
tenderness
of
heart
.
When
I
was
as
old
as
you
,
I
was
a
*NL*
feeling
fellow
enough
,
partial
to
the
unfledged
,
unfostered
,
and
unlucky
;
*NL*
but
Fortune
has
knocked
me
about
since
:
she
has
even
kneaded
me
with
her
*NL*
knuckles
,
and
now
I
flatter
myself
I
am
hard
and
tough
as
an
India-rubber
*NL*
ball
;
pervious
,
though
,
through
a
chink
or
two
still
,
and
with
one
*NL*
sentient
point
in
the
middle
of
the
lump
.
Yes
:
does
that
leave
hope
for
*NL*
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hope
of
what
,
sir
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
my
final
re-transformation
from
India-rubber
back
to
flesh
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Decidedly
he
has
had
too
much
wine
,
''
I
thought
;
and
I
did
not
know
what
*NL*
answer
to
make
to
his
queer
question
:
how
could
I
tell
whether
he
was
*NL*
capable
of
being
re-transformed
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
looked
very
much
puzzled
,
Miss
Eyre
;
and
though
you
are
not
pretty
*NL*
any
more
than
I
am
handsome
,
yet
a
puzzled
air
becomes
you
;
besides
,
it
*NL*
is
convenient
,
for
it
keeps
those
searching
eyes
of
yours
away
from
my
*NL*
physiognomy
,
and
busies
them
with
the
worsted
flowers
of
the
rug
;
so
*NL*
puzzle
on
.
Young
lady
,
I
am
disposed
to
be
gregarious
and
communicative
*NL*
to-night

''
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
announcement
he
rose
from
his
chair
,
and
stood
,
leaning
his
arm
*NL*
on
the
marble
mantelpiece
:
in
that
attitude
his
shape
was
seen
plainly
as
*NL*
well
as
his
face
;
his
unusual
breadth
of
chest
,
disproportionate
almost
*NL*
to
his
length
of
limb
.
I
am
sure
most
people
would
have
thought
him
an
*NL*
ugly
man
;
yet
there
was
so
much
unconscious
pride
in
his
port
;
so
much
*NL*
ease
in
his
demeanour
;
such
a
look
of
complete
indifference
to
his
own
*NL*
external
appearance
;
so
haughty
a
reliance
on
the
power
of
other
*NL*
qualities
,
intrinsic
or
adventitious
,
to
atone
for
the
lack
of
mere
*NL*
personal
attractiveness
,
that
,
in
looking
at
him
,
one
inevitably
shared
*NL*
the
indifference
,
and
,
even
in
a
blind
,
imperfect
sense
,
put
faith
in
the
*NL*
confidence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
disposed
to
be
gregarious
and
communicative
to-night
,
''
he
repeated
,
*NL*
``
and
that
is
why
I
sent
for
you
:
the
fire
and
the
chandelier
were
not
*NL*
sufficient
company
for
me
;
nor
would
Pilot
have
been
,
for
none
of
these
*NL*
can
talk
.
Adele
is
a
degree
better
,
but
still
far
below
the
mark
;
Mrs.
*NL*
Fairfax
ditto
;
you
,
I
am
persuaded
,
can
suit
me
if
you
will

you
puzzled
*NL*
me
the
first
evening
I
invited
you
down
here
.
I
have
almost
forgotten
*NL*
you
since
:
other
ideas
have
driven
yours
from
my
head
;
but
to-night
I
am
*NL*
resolved
to
be
at
ease
;
to
dismiss
what
importunes
,
and
recall
what
*NL*
pleases
.
It
would
please
me
now
to
draw
you
out
--
to
learn
more
of
*NL*
you

therefore
speak

*NL*
*NL*
Instead
of
speaking
,
I
smiled
;
and
not
a
very
complacent
or
submissive
*NL*
smile
either
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak

he
urged
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
about
,

*NL*
*NL*
``
Whatever
you
like

I
leave
both
the
choice
of
subject
and
the
manner
of
*NL*
treating
it
entirely
to
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Accordingly
I
sat
and
said
nothing
:
``
If
he
expects
me
to
talk
for
the
*NL*
mere
sake
of
talking
and
showing
off

will
find

has
addressed

himself

I
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
dumb

Miss

*NL*
*NL*
I
was
dumb
still

He
bent
his
head
a
little
towards
me
,
and
with
a
*NL*
single
hasty
glance
seemed
to
dive
into
my
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stubborn

he
said
,
``

annoyed

Ah

I
put
my
*NL*
request
in
an
absurd

almost
insolent
form
.
Miss
Eyre
,
I
beg
your
*NL*
pardon

The
fact
is

once
for
all

inferior

himself

He
had
deigned
an
explanation

almost
an

I
did
not

insensible

his
condescension

*NL*
*NL*
I
smiled

I
thought
to
myself
Mr.

peculiar

he
seems
to
*NL*
forget
that

pays
me
30

receiving
his

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
he
,
catching
instantly
the
passing
*NL*
expression
;
``

speak
too

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was

*NL*

No

comfortable
in
his
*NL*
dependency

I
agree
heartily
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And

dispense

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I

*NL*
*NL*

Humbug

and
do
n't
venture
on
generalities

*NL*
you
are
intensely
ignorant

However
,
I
mentally
shake
hands
with
you

*NL*
your

despite
its
inaccuracy

and
as
much
for
the

which
*NL*
it
was
said

as
for
the
substance

the

frank

it

yours

Nature
did
it

then
,
after
all
,
I
go
too
fast
in
my
conclusions

for
what
I
yet
*NL*
know

you
may
be
no
better

the
rest

you
may
have
intolerable

counterbalance
your

good
points

*NL*
*NL*

so
may
you

I
thought

My
eye
met
his
as
the
idea
crossed
my
mind
:
*NL*
he
seemed
to
read
the
glance

answering
as

its
import

been
spoken
*NL*
as
well
as
imagined
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

said
he
;
``
I
have
plenty

palliate
them

I
assure
you

God
wot
I
need
*NL*
not
be
too
severe
about

;
I
have
a
past
existence

a
series
of
*NL*
deeds

a
colour
of
life

contemplate
within
my

Little

be
an
exquisite

inexhaustible

All

I
was
your

flatter

read

by-the-bye

what
you

Then
*NL*
take
my
word
for
it

I
am
not

villain

you
are
not

not

me
any
such
bad
eminence

,
owing

I

to
my

I
am
a
trite
commonplace

hackneyed
in
all
the
poor
petty
dissipations
with
which
the
rich
*NL*

worthless

put
on
life

Do
you
wonder
that
I
avow
this

*NL*
Know

that
in

course

your

you
will
often
find
yourself

involuntary

that
it

they
*NL*

feel

that
you
listen

no
malevolent
scorn

their
*NL*
indiscretion

but
with
a
kind
of
innate
sympathy

not
the
less
comforting
*NL*

encouraging
because
it
is
very
unobtrusive
in
its
manifestations

clings
to
you
somewhat

controlling
your

fear

what
you

in

I
think
you
will
learn
to
be
natural
with

I
find
it

impossible

be
conventional
with

have
more

at

the

restless

resolute

pulled

about
ten

with

a

Ere
long

Adele

little
foot
was
heard
tripping
across
the
hall

She
*NL*
entered

transformed
as
her
guardian
had
predicted
.
A
dress
of
*NL*
rose-coloured
satin
,
very
short
,
and
as
full
in
the
skirt
as
it
could
be

gathered

replaced
the
brown
frock
she
had
previously
worn
;
a
wreath
of

rosebuds
circled
her
forehead
;
her
feet
were
dressed
in
silk

and
small
white
satin
sandals

*NL*
``

And
spreading
out
her
dress

she
chasseed
across
the
room
till
,
having
*NL*
reached
Mr.
Rochester
,
she
wheeled
lightly
round
before
him
on
tip-toe
,
*NL*
then
dropped
on
one
knee
at
his
feet
,
exclaiming
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur

vous

rising

My

me
that

in

I
would
fain

rid

now

principle

CHAPTER
XV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Rochester
did
,
on
a
future
occasion
,
explain
it
.
It
was
one
*NL*
afternoon
,
when
he
chanced
to
meet
me
and
Adele
in
the
grounds
:
and
while
*NL*
she
played
with
Pilot
and
her
shuttlecock
,
he
asked
me
to
walk
up
and
*NL*
down
a
long
beech
avenue
within
sight
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
then
said
that
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
French
opera-dancer
,
Celine
*NL*
Varens
,
towards
whom
he
had
once
cherished
what
he
called
a
''
_
grande
*NL*
passion
_
.
''
This
passion
Celine
had
professed
to
return
with
even
*NL*
superior
ardour
.
He
thought
himself
her
idol
,
ugly
as
he
was
:
he
*NL*
believed
,
as
he
said
,
that
she
preferred
his
''
_
taille
d'athlete
_
''
to
the
*NL*
elegance
of
the
Apollo
Belvidere
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
,
Miss
Eyre
,
so
much
was
I
flattered
by
this
preference
of
the
Gallic
*NL*
sylph
for
her
British
gnome
,
that
I
installed
her
in
an
hotel
;
gave
her
a
*NL*
complete
establishment
of
servants
,
a
carriage
,
cashmeres
,
diamonds
,
*NL*
dentelles
,
&
c
.
In
short
,
I
began
the
process
of
ruining
myself
in
the
*NL*
received
style
,
like
any
other
spoony
.
I
had
not
,
it
seems
,
the
*NL*
originality
to
chalk
out
a
new
road
to
shame
and
destruction
,
but
trode
*NL*
the
old
track
with
stupid
exactness
not
to
deviate
an
inch
from
the
*NL*
beaten
centre
.
I
had
--
as
I
deserved
to
have
--
the
fate
of
all
other
*NL*
spoonies
.
Happening
to
call
one
evening
when
Celine
did
not
expect
me
,
I
*NL*
found
her
out
;
but
it
was
a
warm
night
,
and
I
was
tired
with
strolling
*NL*
through
Paris
,
so
I
sat
down
in
her
boudoir
;
happy
to
breathe
the
air
*NL*
consecrated
so
lately
by
her
presence
.
No
,
--
I
exaggerate
;
I
never
*NL*
thought
there
was
any
consecrating
virtue
about
her
:
it
was
rather
a
sort
*NL*
of
pastille
perfume
she
had
left
;
a
scent
of
musk
and
amber
,
than
an
*NL*
odour
of
sanctity
.
I
was
just
beginning
to
stifle
with
the
fumes
of
*NL*
conservatory
flowers
and
sprinkled
essences
,
when
I
bethought
myself
to
*NL*
open
the
window
and
step
out
on
to
the
balcony
.
It
was
moonlight
and
*NL*
gaslight
besides
,
and
very
still
and
serene
.
The
balcony
was
furnished
*NL*
with
a
chair
or
two
;
I
sat
down
,
and
took
out
a
cigar
,
--
I
will
take
one
*NL*
now
,
if
you
will
excuse
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
ensued
a
pause
,
filled
up
by
the
producing
and
lighting
of
a
cigar
;
*NL*
having
placed
it
to
his
lips
and
breathed
a
trail
of
Havannah
incense
on
*NL*
the
freezing
and
sunless
air
,
he
went
on
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
liked
bonbons
too
in
those
days
,
Miss
Eyre
,
and
I
was
*NL*
_
croquant
_
--
-LRB-
overlook
the
barbarism
-RRB-
--
_
croquant
_
chocolate
comfits
,
and
*NL*
smoking
alternately
,
watching
meantime
the
equipages
that
rolled
along
*NL*
the
fashionable
streets
towards
the
neighbouring
opera-house
,
when
in
an
*NL*
elegant
close
carriage
drawn
by
a
beautiful
pair
of
English
horses
,
and
*NL*
distinctly
seen
in
the
brilliant
city-night
,
I
recognised
the
`
voiture
'
I
*NL*
had
given
Celine
.
She
was
returning
:
of
course
my
heart
thumped
with
*NL*
impatience
against
the
iron
rails
I
leant
upon
.
The
carriage
stopped
,
as
*NL*
I
had
expected
,
at
the
hotel
door
;
my
flame
-LRB-
that
is
the
very
word
for
an
*NL*
opera
inamorata
-RRB-
alighted
:
though
muffed
in
a
cloak
--
an
unnecessary
*NL*
encumbrance
,
by-the-bye
,
on
so
warm
a
June
evening
--
I
knew
her
instantly
*NL*
by
her
little
foot
,
seen
peeping
from
the
skirt
of
her
dress
,
as
she
*NL*
skipped
from
the
carriage-step
.
Bending
over
the
balcony
,
I
was
about
to
*NL*
murmur
`
Mon
ange
'
--
in
a
tone
,
of
course
,
which
should
be
audible
to
the
*NL*
ear
of
love
alone
--
when
a
figure
jumped
from
the
carriage
after
her
;
*NL*
cloaked
also
;
but
that
was
a
spurred
heel
which
had
rung
on
the
pavement
,
*NL*
and
that
was
a
hatted
head
which
now
passed
under
the
arched
_
porte
*NL*
cochere
_
of
the
hotel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
never
felt
jealousy
,
did
you
,
Miss
Eyre
?
Of
course
not
:
I
need
not
*NL*
ask
you
;
because
you
never
felt
love
.
You
have
both
sentiments
yet
to
*NL*
experience
:
your
soul
sleeps
;
the
shock
is
yet
to
be
given
which
shall
*NL*
waken
it
.
You
think
all
existence
lapses
in
as
quiet
a
flow
as
that
in
*NL*
which
your
youth
has
hitherto
slid
away
.
Floating
on
with
closed
eyes
*NL*
and
muffled
ears
,
you
neither
see
the
rocks
bristling
not
far
off
in
the
*NL*
bed
of
the
flood
,
nor
hear
the
breakers
boil
at
their
base
.
But
I
tell
*NL*
you
--
and
you
may
mark
my
words
--
you
will
come
some
day
to
a
craggy
pass
*NL*
in
the
channel
,
where
the
whole
of
life
's
stream
will
be
broken
up
into
*NL*
whirl
and
tumult
,
foam
and
noise
:
either
you
will
be
dashed
to
atoms
on
*NL*
crag
points
,
or
lifted
up
and
borne
on
by
some
master-wave
into
a
calmer
*NL*
current

as
I
am
now
.

*NL*
``
I
like
this
day
;
I
like
that
sky
of
steel

I
like
the
sternness
and
*NL*
stillness
of
the
world
under
this
frost
.
I
like
Thornfield
,
its
*NL*
antiquity
,
its
retirement
,
its
old
crow-trees
and
thorn-trees
,
its
grey
*NL*
facade
,
and
lines
of
dark
windows
reflecting
that
metal
welkin
:
and
yet
*NL*
how
long
have
I
abhorred
the
very
thought
of
it
,
shunned
it
like
a
great
*NL*
plague-house
?
How
I
do
still
abhor

He
ground
his
teeth
and
was
silent
:
he
arrested
his
step
and
struck
his
*NL*
boot
against
the
hard
ground
.
Some
hated
thought
seemed
to
have
him
in
*NL*
its
grip
,
and
to
hold
him
so
tightly
that
he
could
not
advance
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
ascending
the
avenue
when
he
thus
paused
;
the
hall
was
before
us
.
*NL*
Lifting
his
eye
to
its
battlements
,
he
cast
over
them
a
glare
such
as
I
*NL*
never
saw
before
or
since
.
Pain
,
shame
,
ire
,
impatience
,
disgust
,
*NL*
detestation
,
seemed
momentarily
to
hold
a
quivering
conflict
in
the
large
*NL*
pupil
dilating
under
his
ebon
eyebrow
.
Wild
was
the
wrestle
which
should
*NL*
be
paramount
;
but
another
feeling
rose
and
triumphed
:
something
hard
and
*NL*
cynical
:
self-willed
and
resolute
:
it
settled
his
passion
and
petrified
*NL*
his
countenance
:
he
went
on
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
During
the
moment
I
was
silent

was
arranging

point

stood
there

by

beech-trunk

a

one

appeared
to
Macbeth
on
the
heath
of
Forres

she
said
,
lifting
her
finger
;
and
then
she
wrote
in
the
air
*NL*
a
memento

ran
in
lurid
hieroglyphics
all
along
the
house-front

Adele
here
ran

he
cried

harshly
;

Continuing
*NL*
then
to
pursue
his
walk
in
silence
,
I
ventured
to
recall
him
to
the
point
*NL*
whence
he
had
abruptly
diverged

``
Did

almost
expected
a

for
this
hardly
well-timed

but
,
on
*NL*
the
contrary
,
waking
out
of
his
scowling
abstraction
,
he
turned
his
eyes

towards
me

and
the
shade
seemed
to
clear
off
his
brow

*NL*
forgotten
Celine
!
Well
,
to
resume
.
When
I
saw
my
charmer
thus
come
in
*NL*
accompanied
by
a
cavalier
,
I
seemed
to
hear
a
hiss
,
and
the
green
snake
*NL*
of
jealousy
,
rising
on
undulating
coils
from
the
moonlit
balcony
,
glided
*NL*
within
my
waistcoat
,
and
ate
its
way
in
two
minutes
to
my
heart
's
core
.
*NL*
Strange
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
suddenly
starting
again
from
the
point
.
``
Strange
*NL*
that
I
should
choose
you
for
the
confidant
of
all
this
,
young
lady
;
*NL*
passing
strange
that
you
should
listen
to
me
quietly
,
as
if
it
were
the
*NL*
most
usual
thing
in
the
world
for
a
man
like
me
to
tell
stories
of
his
*NL*
opera-mistresses
to
a
quaint
,
inexperienced
girl
like
you
!
But
the
last
*NL*
singularity
explains
the
first
,
as
I
intimated
once
before
:
you
,
with
*NL*
your
gravity
,
considerateness
,
and
caution
were
made
to
be
the
recipient
*NL*
of
secrets
.
Besides
,
I
know
what
sort
of
a
mind
I
have
placed
in
*NL*
communication
with
my
own
:
I
know
it
is
one
not
liable
to
take
infection
:
*NL*
it
is
a
peculiar
mind
:
it
is
a
unique
one
.
Happily
I
do
not
mean
to
harm
*NL*
it
:
but
,
if
I
did
,
it
would
not
take
harm
from
me
.
The
more
you
and
I
*NL*
converse
,
the
better
;
for
while
I
can
not
blight
you
,
you
may
refresh
me
.
''
*NL*
After
this
digression
he
proceeded
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
remained
in
the
balcony
.
`
They
will
come
to
her
boudoir
,
no
doubt
,
'
*NL*
thought
I
:
`
let
me
prepare
an
ambush
.
'
So
putting
my
hand
in
through
the
*NL*
open
window
,
I
drew
the
curtain
over
it
,
leaving
only
an
opening
through
*NL*
which
I
could
take
observations
;
then
I
closed
the
casement
,
all
but
a
*NL*
chink
just
wide
enough
to
furnish
an
outlet
to
lovers
'
whispered
vows
:
*NL*
then
I
stole
back
to
my
chair
;
and
as
I
resumed
it
the
pair
came
in
.
My
*NL*
eye
was
quickly
at
the
aperture
.
Celine
's
chamber-maid
entered
,
lit
a
*NL*
lamp
,
left
it
on
the
table
,
and
withdrew
.
The
couple
were
thus
revealed
*NL*
to
me
clearly
:
both
removed
their
cloaks
,
and
there
was
`
the
Varens
,
'
*NL*
shining
in
satin
and
jewels
,
--
my
gifts
of
course
,
--
and
there
was
her
*NL*
companion
in
an
officer
's
uniform
;
and
I
knew
him
for
a
young
roue
of
a
*NL*
vicomte
--
a
brainless
and
vicious
youth
whom
I
had
sometimes
met
in
*NL*
society
,
and
had
never
thought
of
hating
because
I
despised
him
so
*NL*
absolutely
.
On
recognising
him
,
the
fang
of
the
snake
Jealousy
was
*NL*
instantly
broken
;
because
at
the
same
moment
my
love
for
Celine
sank
*NL*
under
an
extinguisher
.
A
woman
who
could
betray
me
for
such
a
rival
was
*NL*
not
worth
contending
for
;
she
deserved
only
scorn
;
less
,
however
,
than
I
,
*NL*
who
had
been
her
dupe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
began
to
talk
;
their
conversation
eased
me
completely
:
frivolous
,
*NL*
mercenary
,
heartless
,
and
senseless
,
it
was
rather
calculated
to
weary
*NL*
than
enrage
a
listener
.
A
card
of
mine
lay
on
the
table
;
this
being
*NL*
perceived
,
brought
my
name
under
discussion
.
Neither
of
them
possessed
*NL*
energy
or
wit
to
belabour
me
soundly
,
but
they
insulted
me
as
coarsely
as
*NL*
they
could
in
their
little
way
:
especially
Celine
,
who
even
waxed
rather
*NL*
brilliant
on
my
personal
defects
--
deformities
she
termed
them
.
Now
it
*NL*
had
been
her
custom
to
launch
out
into
fervent
admiration
of
what
she
*NL*
called
my
'
_
beaute
male
_
:
'
wherein
she
differed
diametrically
from
you
,
*NL*
who
told
me
point-blank
,
at
the
second
interview
,
that
you
did
not
think
*NL*
me
handsome
.
The
contrast
struck
me
at
the
time
and
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adele
here
came
running
up
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
John
has
just
been
to
say
that
your
agent
has
called
and
*NL*
wishes
to
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
in
that
case
I
must
abridge
.
Opening
the
window
,
I
walked
in
upon
*NL*
them
;
liberated
Celine
from
my
protection
;
gave
her
notice
to
vacate
her
*NL*
hotel
;
offered
her
a
purse
for
immediate
exigencies
;
disregarded
screams
,
*NL*
hysterics
,
prayers
,
protestations
,
convulsions
;
made
an
appointment
with
*NL*
the
vicomte
for
a
meeting
at
the
Bois
de
Boulogne
.
Next
morning
I
had
*NL*
the
pleasure
of
encountering
him
;
left
a
bullet
in
one
of
his
poor
*NL*
etiolated
arms
,
feeble
as
the
wing
of
a
chicken
in
the
pip
,
and
then
*NL*
thought
I
had
done
with
the
whole
crew
.
But
unluckily
the
Varens
,
six
*NL*
months
before
,
had
given
me
this
filette
Adele
,
who
,
she
affirmed
,
was
my
*NL*
daughter
;
and
perhaps
she
may
be
,
though
I
see
no
proofs
of
such
grim
*NL*
paternity
written
in
her
countenance
:
Pilot
is
more
like
me
than
she
.
*NL*
Some
years
after
I
had
broken
with
the
mother
,
she
abandoned
her
child
,
*NL*
and
ran
away
to
Italy
with
a
musician
or
singer
.
I
acknowledged
no
*NL*
natural
claim
on
Adele
's
part
to
be
supported
by
me
,
nor
do
I
now
*NL*
acknowledge
any
,
for
I
am
not
her
father
;
but
hearing
that
she
was
quite
*NL*
destitute
,
I
e
`
en
took
the
poor
thing
out
of
the
slime
and
mud
of
Paris
,
*NL*
and
transplanted
it
here
,
to
grow
up
clean
in
the
wholesome
soil
of
an
*NL*
English
country
garden
.
Mrs.
Fairfax
found
you
to
train
it
;
but
now
you
*NL*
know
that
it
is
the
illegitimate
offspring
of
a
French
opera-girl
,
you
*NL*
will
perhaps
think
differently
of
your
post
and
protegee
:
you
will
be
*NL*
coming
to
me
some
day
with
notice
that
you
have
found
another
place
--
that
*NL*
you
beg
me
to
look
out
for
a
new
governess
,
&
c.
--
Eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
:
Adele
is
not
answerable
for
either
her
mother
's
faults
or
yours
:
I
*NL*
have
a
regard
for
her
;
and
now
that
I
know
she
is
,
in
a
sense
,
*NL*
parentless
--
forsaken
by
her
mother
and
disowned
by
you
,
sir
--
I
shall
*NL*
cling
closer
to
her
than
before
.
How
could
I
possibly
prefer
the
spoilt
*NL*
pet
of
a
wealthy
family
,
who
would
hate
her
governess
as
a
nuisance
,
to
a
*NL*
lonely
little
orphan
,
who
leans
towards
her
as
a
friend
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
is
the
light
in
which
you
view
it
!
Well
,
I
must
go
in
now
;
and
*NL*
you
too
:
it
darkens
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
stayed
out
a
few
minutes
longer
with
Adele
and
Pilot
--
ran
a
race
*NL*
with
her
,
and
played
a
game
of
battledore
and
shuttlecock
.
When
we
went
*NL*
in
,
and
I
had
removed
her
bonnet
and
coat
,
I
took
her
on
my
knee
;
kept
*NL*
her
there
an
hour
,
allowing
her
to
prattle
as
she
liked
:
not
rebuking
*NL*
even
some
little
freedoms
and
trivialities
into
which
she
was
apt
to
*NL*
stray
when
much
noticed
,
and
which
betrayed
in
her
a
superficiality
of
*NL*
character
,
inherited
probably
from
her
mother
,
hardly
congenial
to
an
*NL*
English
mind
.
Still
she
had
her
merits
;
and
I
was
disposed
to
appreciate
*NL*
all
that
was
good
in
her
to
the
utmost
.
I
sought
in
her
countenance
and
*NL*
features
a
likeness
to
Mr.
Rochester
,
but
found
none
:
no
trait
,
no
turn
*NL*
of
expression
announced
relationship
.
It
was
a
pity
:
if
she
could
but
*NL*
have
been
proved
to
resemble
him
,
he
would
have
thought
more
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
till
after
I
had
withdrawn
to
my
own
chamber
for
the
night
,
*NL*
that
I
steadily
reviewed
the
tale
Mr.
Rochester
had
told
me
.
As
he
had
*NL*
said
,
there
was
probably
nothing
at
all
extraordinary
in
the
substance
of
*NL*
the
narrative
itself
:
a
wealthy
Englishman
's
passion
for
a
French
dancer
,
*NL*
and
her
treachery
to
him
,
were
every-day
matters
enough
,
no
doubt
,
in
*NL*
society
;
but
there
was
something
decidedly
strange
in
the
paroxysm
of
*NL*
emotion
which
had
suddenly
seized
him
when
he
was
in
the
act
of
*NL*
expressing
the
present
contentment
of
his
mood
,
and
his
newly
revived
*NL*
pleasure
in
the
old
hall
and
its
environs
.
I
meditated
wonderingly
on
*NL*
this
incident
;
but
gradually
quitting
it
,
as
I
found
it
for
the
present
*NL*
inexplicable
,
I
turned
to
the
consideration
of
my
master
's
manner
to
*NL*
myself
.
The
confidence
he
had
thought
fit
to
repose
in
me
seemed
a
*NL*
tribute
to
my
discretion
:
I
regarded
and
accepted
it
as
such
.
His
*NL*
deportment
had
now
for
some
weeks
been
more
uniform
towards
me
than
at
*NL*
the
first
.
I
never
seemed
in
his
way
;
he
did
not
take
fits
of
chilling
*NL*
hauteur
:
when
he
met
me
unexpectedly
,
the
encounter
seemed
welcome
;
he
*NL*
had
always
a
word
and
sometimes
a
smile
for
me
:
when
summoned
by
formal
*NL*
invitation
to
his
presence
,
I
was
honoured
by
a
cordiality
of
reception
*NL*
that
made
me
feel
I
really
possessed
the
power
to
amuse
him
,
and
that
*NL*
these
evening
conferences
were
sought
as
much
for
his
pleasure
as
for
my
*NL*
benefit
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
,
indeed
,
talked
comparatively
little
,
but
I
heard
him
talk
with
relish
.
*NL*
It
was
his
nature
to
be
communicative
;
he
liked
to
open
to
a
mind
*NL*
unacquainted
with
the
world
glimpses
of
its
scenes
and
ways
-LRB-
I
do
not
*NL*
mean
its
corrupt
scenes
and
wicked
ways
,
but
such
as
derived
their
*NL*
interest
from
the
great
scale
on
which
they
were
acted
,
the
strange
*NL*
novelty
by
which
they
were
characterised
-RRB-
;
and
I
had
a
keen
delight
in
*NL*
receiving
the
new
ideas
he
offered
,
in
imagining
the
new
pictures
he
*NL*
portrayed
,
and
following
him
in
thought
through
the
new
regions
he
*NL*
disclosed
,
never
startled
or
troubled
by
one
noxious
allusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ease
of
his
manner
freed
me
from
painful
restraint
:
the
friendly
*NL*
frankness
,
as
correct
as
cordial
,
with
which
he
treated
me
,
drew
me
to
*NL*
him
.
I
felt
at
times
as
if
he
were
my
relation
rather
than
my
master
:
*NL*
yet
he
was
imperious
sometimes
still
;
but
I
did
not
mind
that
;
I
saw
it
*NL*
was
his
way
.
So
happy
,
so
gratified
did
I
become
with
this
new
interest
*NL*
added
to
life
,
that
I
ceased
to
pine
after
kindred
:
my
thin
*NL*
crescent-destiny
seemed
to
enlarge
;
the
blanks
of
existence
were
filled
*NL*
up
;
my
bodily
health
improved
;
I
gathered
flesh
and
strength
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
was
Mr.
Rochester
now
ugly
in
my
eyes
?
No
,
reader
:
gratitude
,
and
*NL*
many
associations
,
all
pleasurable
and
genial
,
made
his
face
the
object
I
*NL*
best
liked
to
see
;
his
presence
in
a
room
was
more
cheering
than
the
*NL*
brightest
fire
.
Yet
I
had
not
forgotten
his
faults
;
indeed
,
I
could
not
,
*NL*
for
he
brought
them
frequently
before
me
.
He
was
proud
,
sardonic
,
harsh
*NL*
to
inferiority
of
every
description
:
in
my
secret
soul
I
knew
that
his
*NL*
great
kindness
to
me
was
balanced
by
unjust
severity
to
many
others
.
He
*NL*
was
moody
,
too
;
unaccountably
so
;
I
more
than
once
,
when
sent
for
to
read
*NL*
to
him
,
found
him
sitting
in
his
library
alone
,
with
his
head
bent
on
his
*NL*
folded
arms
;
and
,
when
he
looked
up
,
a
morose
,
almost
a
malignant
,
scowl
*NL*
blackened
his
features
.
But
I
believed
that
his
moodiness
,
his
*NL*
harshness
,
and
his
former
faults
of
morality
-LRB-
I
say
_
former
_
,
for
now
he
*NL*
seemed
corrected
of
them
-RRB-
had
their
source
in
some
cruel
cross
of
fate
.
I
*NL*
believed
he
was
naturally
a
man
of
better
tendencies
,
higher
principles
,
*NL*
and
purer
tastes
than
such
as
circumstances
had
developed
,
education
*NL*
instilled
,
or
destiny
encouraged
.
I
thought
there
were
excellent
*NL*
materials
in
him
;
though
for
the
present
they
hung
together
somewhat
*NL*
spoiled
and
tangled
.
I
can
not
deny
that
I
grieved
for
his
grief
,
*NL*
whatever
that
was
,
and
would
have
given
much
to
assuage
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
I
had
now
extinguished
my
candle
and
was
laid
down
in
bed
,
I
could
*NL*
not
sleep
for
thinking
of
his
look
when
he
paused
in
the
avenue
,
and
told
*NL*
how
his
destiny
had
risen
up
before
him
,
and
dared
him
to
be
happy
at
*NL*
Thornfield
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
''
I
asked
myself
.
``
What
alienates
him
from
the
house
?
Will
he
*NL*
leave
it
again
soon
?
Mrs.
Fairfax
said
he
seldom
stayed
here
longer
than
*NL*
a
fortnight
at
a
time
;
and
he
has
now
been
resident
eight
weeks
.
If
he
*NL*
does
go
,
the
change
will
be
doleful
.
Suppose
he
should
be
absent
spring
,
*NL*
summer
,
and
autumn
:
how
joyless
sunshine
and
fine
days
will
seem
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
hardly
know
whether
I
had
slept
or
not
after
this
musing
;
at
any
rate
,
*NL*
I
started
wide
awake
on
hearing
a
vague
murmur
,
peculiar
and
lugubrious
,
*NL*
which
sounded
,
I
thought
,
just
above
me
.
I
wished
I
had
kept
my
candle
*NL*
burning
:
the
night
was
drearily
dark
;
my
spirits
were
depressed
.
I
rose
*NL*
and
sat
up
in
bed
,
listening
.
The
sound
was
hushed
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
tried
again
to
sleep
;
but
my
heart
beat
anxiously
:
my
inward
*NL*
tranquillity
was
broken
.
The
clock
,
far
down
in
the
hall
,
struck
two
.
*NL*
Just
then
it
seemed
my
chamber-door
was
touched
;
as
if
fingers
had
swept
*NL*
the
panels
in
groping
a
way
along
the
dark
gallery
outside
.
I
said
,
``
Who
*NL*
is
there
?
''
Nothing
answered
.
I
was
chilled
with
fear
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
I
remembered
that
it
might
be
Pilot
,
who
,
when
the
kitchen
-
*NL*
door
chanced
to
be
left
open
,
not
unfrequently
found
his
way
up
to
the
*NL*
threshold
of
Mr.
Rochester
's
chamber
:
I
had
seen
him
lying
there
myself
*NL*
in
the
mornings
.
The
idea
calmed
me
somewhat
:
I
lay
down
.
Silence
*NL*
composes
the
nerves
;
and
as
an
unbroken
hush
now
reigned
again
through
*NL*
the
whole
house
,
I
began
to
feel
the
return
of
slumber
.
But
it
was
not
*NL*
fated
that
I
should
sleep
that
night
.
A
dream
had
scarcely
approached
my
*NL*
ear
,
when
it
fled
affrighted
,
scared
by
a
marrow-freezing
incident
*NL*
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
demoniac
laugh
--
low
,
suppressed
,
and
deep
--
uttered
,
as
it
*NL*
seemed
,
at
the
very
keyhole
of
my
chamber
door
.
The
head
of
my
bed
was
*NL*
near
the
door
,
and
I
thought
at
first
the
goblin-laugher
stood
at
my
*NL*
bedside
--
or
rather
,
crouched
by
my
pillow
:
but
I
rose
,
looked
round
,
and
*NL*
could
see
nothing
;
while
,
as
I
still
gazed
,
the
unnatural
sound
was
*NL*
reiterated
:
and
I
knew
it
came
from
behind
the
panels
.
My
first
impulse
*NL*
was
to
rise
and
fasten
the
bolt
;
my
next
,
again
to
cry
out
,
``
Who
is
*NL*
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Something
gurgled
and
moaned
.
Ere
long
,
steps
retreated
up
the
gallery
*NL*
towards
the
third-storey
staircase
:
a
door
had
lately
been
made
to
shut
*NL*
in
that
staircase
;
I
heard
it
open
and
close
,
and
all
was
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
that
Grace
Poole
?
and
is
she
possessed
with
a
devil
?
''
thought
I.
*NL*
Impossible
now
to
remain
longer
by
myself
:
I
must
go
to
Mrs.
Fairfax
.
I
*NL*
hurried
on
my
frock
and
a
shawl
;
I
withdrew
the
bolt
and
opened
the
door
*NL*
with
a
trembling
hand
.
There
was
a
candle
burning
just
outside
,
and
on
*NL*
the
matting
in
the
gallery
.
I
was
surprised
at
this
circumstance
:
but
*NL*
still
more
was
I
amazed
to
perceive
the
air
quite
dim
,
as
if
filled
with
*NL*
smoke
;
and
,
while
looking
to
the
right
hand
and
left
,
to
find
whence
*NL*
these
blue
wreaths
issued
,
I
became
further
aware
of
a
strong
smell
of
*NL*
burning
.
*NL*
*NL*
Something
creaked
:
it
was
a
door
ajar
;
and
that
door
was
Mr.
Rochester
's
,
*NL*
and
the
smoke
rushed
in
a
cloud
from
thence
.
I
thought
no
more
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Fairfax
;
I
thought
no
more
of
Grace
Poole
,
or
the
laugh
:
in
an
instant
,
I
*NL*
was
within
the
chamber
.
Tongues
of
flame
darted
round
the
bed
:
the
*NL*
curtains
were
on
fire
.
In
the
midst
of
blaze
and
vapour
,
Mr.
Rochester
*NL*
lay
stretched
motionless
,
in
deep
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wake
!
wake
!
''
I
cried
.
I
shook
him
,
but
he
only
murmured
and
turned
:
the
*NL*
smoke
had
stupefied
him
.
Not
a
moment
could
be
lost
:
the
very
sheets
*NL*
were
kindling
,
I
rushed
to
his
basin
and
ewer
;
fortunately
,
one
was
wide
*NL*
and
the
other
deep
,
and
both
were
filled
with
water
.
I
heaved
them
up
,
*NL*
deluged
the
bed
and
its
occupant
,
flew
back
to
my
own
room
,
brought
my
*NL*
own
water-jug
,
baptized
the
couch
afresh
,
and
,
by
God
's
aid
,
succeeded
in
*NL*
extinguishing
the
flames
which
were
devouring
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hiss
of
the
quenched
element
,
the
breakage
of
a
pitcher
which
I
flung
*NL*
from
my
hand
when
I
had
emptied
it
,
and
,
above
all
,
the
splash
of
the
*NL*
shower-bath
I
had
liberally
bestowed
,
roused
Mr.
Rochester
at
last
.
*NL*
Though
it
was
now
dark
,
I
knew
he
was
awake
;
because
I
heard
him
*NL*
fulminating
strange
anathemas
at
finding
himself
lying
in
a
pool
of
*NL*
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
a
flood
?
''
he
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
''
I
answered
;
``
but
there
has
been
a
fire
:
get
up
,
do
;
you
are
*NL*
quenched
now
;
I
will
fetch
you
a
candle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
name
of
all
the
elves
in
Christendom
,
is
that
Jane
Eyre
?
''
he
*NL*
demanded
.
``
What
have
you
done
with
me
,
witch
,
sorceress
?
Who
is
in
the
*NL*
room
besides
you
?
Have
you
plotted
to
drown
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
fetch
you
a
candle
,
sir
;
and
,
in
Heaven
's
name
,
get
up
.
Somebody
*NL*
has
plotted
something
:
you
can
not
too
soon
find
out
who
and
what
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
!
I
am
up
now
;
but
at
your
peril
you
fetch
a
candle
yet
:
wait
two
*NL*
minutes
till
I
get
into
some
dry
garments
,
if
any
dry
there
be
--
yes
,
here
*NL*
is
my
dressing-gown
.
Now
run
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
run
;
I
brought
the
candle
which
still
remained
in
the
gallery
.
He
*NL*
took
it
from
my
hand
,
held
it
up
,
and
surveyed
the
bed
,
all
blackened
and
*NL*
scorched
,
the
sheets
drenched
,
the
carpet
round
swimming
in
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
and
who
did
it
?
''
he
asked
.
I
briefly
related
to
him
what
*NL*
had
transpired
:
the
strange
laugh
I
had
heard
in
the
gallery
:
the
step
*NL*
ascending
to
the
third
storey
;
the
smoke
,
--
the
smell
of
fire
which
had
*NL*
conducted
me
to
his
room
;
in
what
state
I
had
found
matters
there
,
and
*NL*
how
I
had
deluged
him
with
all
the
water
I
could
lay
hands
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LCB-
``
What
is
it
and
who
did
it
?
''
he
asked
:
p140.jpg
-RCB-
*NL*
*NL*
He
listened
very
gravely
;
his
face
,
as
I
went
on
,
expressed
more
concern
*NL*
than
astonishment
;
he
did
not
immediately
speak
when
I
had
concluded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
call
Mrs.
Fairfax
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Fairfax
?
No
;
what
the
deuce
would
you
call
her
for
?
What
can
she
*NL*
do
?
Let
her
sleep
unmolested
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
will
fetch
Leah
,
and
wake
John
and
his
wife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
:
just
be
still
.
You
have
a
shawl
on
.
If
you
are
not
warm
*NL*
enough
,
you
may
take
my
cloak
yonder
;
wrap
it
about
you
,
and
sit
down
in
*NL*
the
arm-chair
:
there
,
--
I
will
put
it
on
.
Now
place
your
feet
on
the
*NL*
stool
,
to
keep
them
out
of
the
wet

I
am
going
to
leave
you
a
few
*NL*
minutes

I
shall
take
the
candle

Remain
where
you
are

I
return
;

be
as
still

a
mouse

I
must
pay
a
visit
to
the
second
storey

Do
n't
*NL*
move
,
remember
,
or
call
any
one

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
:
I
watched
the
light
withdraw
.
He
passed
up
the
gallery
very
*NL*
softly
,
unclosed
the
staircase
door
with
as
little
noise
as
possible
,
*NL*
shut
it
after
him
,
and
the
last
ray
vanished
.
I
was
left
in
total
*NL*
darkness
.
I
listened
for
some
noise
,
but
heard
nothing
.
A
very
long
*NL*
time
elapsed
.
I
grew
weary
:
it
was
cold
,
in
spite
of
the
cloak
;
and
then
*NL*
I
did
not
see
the
use
of
staying
,
as
I
was
not
to
rouse
the
house
.
I
was
*NL*
on
the
point
of
risking
Mr.
Rochester
's
displeasure
by
disobeying
his
*NL*
orders
,
when
the
light
once
more
gleamed
dimly
on
the
gallery
wall
,
and
I
*NL*
heard
his
unshod
feet
tread
the
matting
.
``
I
hope
it
is
he
,
''
thought
I
,
*NL*
``
and
not
something
worse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
re-entered
,
pale
and
very
gloomy
.
``
I
have
found
it
all
out
,
''
said
he
,
*NL*
setting
his
candle
down
on
the
washstand
;
``
it
is
as
I
thought
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
no
reply
,
but
stood
with
his
arms
folded
,
looking
on
the
ground
.
*NL*
At
the
end
of
a
few
minutes
he
inquired
in
rather
a
peculiar
tone
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
forget
whether
you
said
you
saw
anything
when
you
opened
your
chamber
*NL*
door
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
only
the
candlestick
on
the
ground

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
heard
an
odd
laugh

You
have
heard
that
laugh
before

I
should
*NL*
think

something
like
it
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

sir

there
is
a
woman

sews
here

called
Grace

in

way

She
is
a
singular

*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
so

Grace
Poole

you
have
guessed
it

She
is
,
as
you
say

singular

very
.
Well

I
shall
reflect
on
the
subject

Meantime

I
am
*NL*
glad
that
you
are
the
only
person

acquainted

precise
details

to-night

incident

You
are
no
talking
fool

say

nothing
about
it

I
will
account
for
this
state
of
affairs

-LRB-
pointing
to
*NL*
the
bed
-RRB-
:
``
and
now
return
to
your
own
room

I
shall
do
very
well
on

sofa
in

the
rest
of
the
night

It

near
four

up

*NL*
``
Good-night

said
I

departing

*NL*
*NL*
He
seemed
surprised

very
inconsistently
so
,
as
he
had
just
told
me
to
*NL*
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What

he
exclaimed
,
``
are
you
quitting
me
already

in

horrible

excruciating
death

as

mutual
strangers

*NL*
At

shake
hands

*NL*
He
held
out
his
hand
;
I
gave
him
mine
:
he
took
it
first
in
one

them
in
*NL*
both
his

*NL*
``

not

Nothing

He
paused

gazed
at
me
:
words
almost
visible
trembled
on
his

his
voice
was
checked

*NL*
``

hastily

Strange

in

strange

in
his
look

*NL*
*NL*
``

But
he
still
*NL*
retained
my
hand
,
and
I
could
not

it

I
bethought
myself
of
an

expedient

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think

hear

move

said
I.

*NL*
``
Well

me

he
relaxed
his
fingers
,
and
I
was
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
regained
my
couch
,
but
never
thought
of
sleep
.
Till
morning
dawned
I
*NL*
was
tossed
on
a
buoyant
but
unquiet
sea
,
where
billows
of
trouble
rolled
*NL*
under
surges
of
joy
.
I
thought
sometimes
I
saw
beyond
its
wild
waters
a
*NL*
shore
,
sweet
as
the
hills
of
Beulah
;
and
now
and
then
a
freshening
gale
,
*NL*
wakened
by
hope
,
bore
my
spirit
triumphantly
towards
the
bourne
:
but
I
*NL*
could
not
reach
it
,
even
in
fancy
--
a
counteracting
breeze
blew
off
land
,
*NL*
and
continually
drove
me
back
.
Sense
would
resist
delirium
:
judgment
*NL*
would
warn
passion
.
Too
feverish
to
rest
,
I
rose
as
soon
as
day
dawned

CHAPTER
XVI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
both
wished
and
feared
to
see
Mr.
Rochester
on
the
day
which
followed
*NL*
this
sleepless
night
:
I
wanted
to
hear
his
voice
again
,
yet
feared
to
*NL*
meet
his
eye
.
During
the
early
part
of
the
morning
,
I
momentarily
*NL*
expected
his
coming
;
he
was
not
in
the
frequent
habit
of
entering
the
*NL*
schoolroom
,
but
he
did
step
in
for
a
few
minutes
sometimes
,
and
I
had
the
*NL*
impression
that
he
was
sure
to
visit
it
that
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
morning
passed
just
as
usual
:
nothing
happened
to
interrupt
the
*NL*
quiet
course
of
Adele
's
studies
;
only
soon
after
breakfast
,
I
heard
some
*NL*
bustle
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Mr.
Rochester
's
chamber
,
Mrs.
Fairfax
's
*NL*
voice
,
and
Leah
's
,
and
the
cook
's
--
that
is
,
John
's
wife
--
and
even
John
's
*NL*
own
gruff
tones
.
There
were
exclamations
of
``
What
a
mercy
master
was
not
*NL*
burnt
in
his
bed
!
''
``
It
is
always
dangerous
to
keep
a
candle
lit
at
*NL*
night
.
''
``
How
providential
that
he
had
presence
of
mind
to
think
of
the
*NL*
water-jug
!
''
``
I
wonder
he
waked
nobody
!
''
``
It
is
to
be
hoped
he
will
not
*NL*
take
cold
with
sleeping
on
the
library
sofa
,
''
&
c.
*NL*
*NL*
To
much
confabulation
succeeded
a
sound
of
scrubbing
and
setting
to
*NL*
rights
;
and
when
I
passed
the
room
,
in
going
downstairs
to
dinner
,
I
saw
*NL*
through
the
open
door
that
all
was
again
restored
to
complete
order
;
only
*NL*
the
bed
was
stripped
of
its
hangings
.
Leah
stood
up
in
the
window-seat
,
*NL*
rubbing
the
panes
of
glass
dimmed
with
smoke
.
I
was
about
to
address
*NL*
her
,
for
I
wished
to
know
what
account
had
been
given
of
the
affair
:
but
,
*NL*
on
advancing
,
I
saw
a
second
person
in
the
chamber
--
a
woman
sitting
on
a
*NL*
chair
by
the
bedside
,
and
sewing
rings
to
new
curtains
.
That
woman
was
*NL*
no
other
than
Grace
Poole
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
she
sat
,
staid
and
taciturn-looking
,
as
usual
,
in
her
brown
stuff
*NL*
gown
,
her
check
apron
,
white
handkerchief
,
and
cap
.
She
was
intent
on
*NL*
her
work
,
in
which
her
whole
thoughts
seemed
absorbed
:
on
her
hard
*NL*
forehead
,
and
in
her
commonplace
features
,
was
nothing
either
of
the
*NL*
paleness
or
desperation
one
would
have
expected
to
see
marking
the
*NL*
countenance
of
a
woman
who
had
attempted
murder
,
and
whose
intended
*NL*
victim
had
followed
her
last
night
to
her
lair
,
and
-LRB-
as
I
believed
-RRB-
,
*NL*
charged
her
with
the
crime
she
wished
to
perpetrate
.
I
was
*NL*
amazed
--
confounded
.
She
looked
up
,
while
I
still
gazed
at
her
:
no
start
,
*NL*
no
increase
or
failure
of
colour
betrayed
emotion
,
consciousness
of
*NL*
guilt
,
or
fear
of
detection
.
She
said
``
Good
morning
,
Miss
,
''
in
her
usual
*NL*
phlegmatic
and
brief
manner
;
and
taking
up
another
ring
and
more
tape
,
*NL*
went
on
with
her
sewing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
put
her
to
some
test
,
''
thought
I
:
``
such
absolute
impenetrability
*NL*
is
past
comprehension
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
morning
,
Grace
,
''
I
said
.
``
Has
anything
happened
here
?
I
thought
I
*NL*
heard
the
servants
all
talking
together
a
while
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
master
had
been
reading
in
his
bed
last
night
;
he
fell
asleep
with
*NL*
his
candle
lit
,
and
the
curtains
got
on
fire
;
but
,
fortunately
,
he
awoke
*NL*
before
the
bed-clothes
or
the
wood-work
caught
,
and
contrived
to
quench
*NL*
the
flames
with
the
water
in
the
ewer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
strange
affair
!
''
I
said
,
in
a
low
voice
:
then
,
looking
at
her
*NL*
fixedly
--
``
Did
Mr.
Rochester
wake
nobody
?
Did
no
one
hear
him
move
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
again
raised
her
eyes
to
me
,
and
this
time
there
was
something
of
*NL*
consciousness
in
their
expression
.
She
seemed
to
examine
me
warily
;
then
*NL*
she
answered
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
servants
sleep
so
far
off
,
you
know
,
Miss
,
they
would
not
be
likely
*NL*
to
hear
.
Mrs.
Fairfax
's
room
and
yours
are
the
nearest
to
master
's
;
but
*NL*
Mrs.
Fairfax
said
she
heard
nothing
:
when
people
get
elderly
,
they
often
*NL*
sleep
heavy
.
''
She
paused
,
and
then
added
,
with
a
sort
of
assumed
*NL*
indifference
,
but
still
in
a
marked
and
significant
tone
--
``
But
you
are
*NL*
young
,
Miss
;
and
I
should
say
a
light
sleeper
:
perhaps
you
may
have
heard
*NL*
a
noise
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
,
''
said
I
,
dropping
my
voice
,
so
that
Leah
,
who
was
still
polishing
*NL*
the
panes
,
could
not
hear
me
,
``
and
at
first
I
thought
it
was
Pilot
:
but
*NL*
Pilot
can
not
laugh
;
and
I
am
certain
I
heard
a
laugh
,
and
a
strange
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
a
new
needleful
of
thread
,
waxed
it
carefully
,
threaded
her
*NL*
needle
with
a
steady
hand
,
and
then
observed
,
with
perfect
composure
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
hardly
likely
master
would
laugh
,
I
should
think
,
Miss
,
when
he
*NL*
was
in
such
danger
:
You
must
have
been
dreaming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
not
dreaming
,
''
I
said
,
with
some
warmth
,
for
her
brazen
coolness
*NL*
provoked
me
.
Again
she
looked
at
me
;
and
with
the
same
scrutinising
and
*NL*
conscious
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
told
master
that
you
heard
a
laugh
?
''
she
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
had
the
opportunity
of
speaking
to
him
this
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
not
think
of
opening
your
door
and
looking
out
into
the
*NL*
gallery
?
''
she
further
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
appeared
to
be
cross-questioning
me
,
attempting
to
draw
from
me
*NL*
information
unawares
.
The
idea
struck
me
that
if
she
discovered
I
knew
*NL*
or
suspected
her
guilt
,
she
would
be
playing
of
some
of
her
malignant
*NL*
pranks
on
me
;
I
thought
it
advisable
to
be
on
my
guard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
contrary
,
''
said
I
,
``
I
bolted
my
door
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
are
not
in
the
habit
of
bolting
your
door
every
night
before
*NL*
you
get
into
bed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fiend
!
she
wants
to
know
my
habits
,
that
she
may
lay
her
plans
*NL*
accordingly
!
''
Indignation
again
prevailed
over
prudence
:
I
replied
*NL*
sharply
,
``
Hitherto
I
have
often
omitted
to
fasten
the
bolt
:
I
did
not
*NL*
think
it
necessary
.
I
was
not
aware
any
danger
or
annoyance
was
to
be
*NL*
dreaded
at
Thornfield
Hall
:
but
in
future
''
-LRB-
and
I
laid
marked
stress
on
*NL*
the
words
-RRB-
``
I
shall
take
good
care
to
make
all
secure
before
I
venture
to
*NL*
lie
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
be
wise
so
to
do
,
''
was
her
answer
:
``
this
neighbourhood
is
as
*NL*
quiet
as
any
I
know
,
and
I
never
heard
of
the
hall
being
attempted
by
*NL*
robbers
since
it
was
a
house
;
though
there
are
hundreds
of
pounds
'
worth
*NL*
of
plate
in
the
plate-closet
,
as
is
well
known
.
And
you
see
,
for
such
a
*NL*
large
house
,
there
are
very
few
servants
,
because
master
has
never
lived
*NL*
here
much
;
and
when
he
does
come
,
being
a
bachelor
,
he
needs
little
*NL*
waiting
on
:
but
I
always
think
it
best
to
err
on
the
safe
side
;
a
door
is
*NL*
soon
fastened
,
and
it
is
as
well
to
have
a
drawn
bolt
between
one
and
any
*NL*
mischief
that
may
be
about
.
A
deal
of
people
,
Miss
,
are
for
trusting
all
*NL*
to
Providence
;
but
I
say
Providence
will
not
dispense
with
the
means
,
*NL*
though
He
often
blesses
them
when
they
are
used
discreetly
.
''
And
here
*NL*
she
closed
her
harangue
:
a
long
one
for
her
,
and
uttered
with
the
*NL*
demureness
of
a
Quakeress
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
still
stood
absolutely
dumfoundered
at
what
appeared
to
me
her
*NL*
miraculous
self-possession
and
most
inscrutable
hypocrisy
,
when
the
cook
*NL*
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Poole
,
''
said
she
,
addressing
Grace
,
``
the
servants
'
dinner
will
soon
*NL*
be
ready
:
will
you
come
down
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
just
put
my
pint
of
porter
and
bit
of
pudding
on
a
tray
,
and
I
'll
*NL*
carry
it
upstairs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
have
some
meat
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
a
morsel
,
and
a
taste
of
cheese
,
that
's
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
sago
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
it
at
present
:
I
shall
be
coming
down
before
teatime
:
I
'll
*NL*
make
it
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
cook
here
turned
to
me
,
saying
that
Mrs.
Fairfax
was
waiting
for
me
:
*NL*
so
I
departed
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
hardly
heard
Mrs.
Fairfax
's
account
of
the
curtain
conflagration
during
*NL*
dinner
,
so
much
was
I
occupied
in
puzzling
my
brains
over
the
enigmatical
*NL*
character
of
Grace
Poole
,
and
still
more
in
pondering
the
problem
of
her
*NL*
position
at
Thornfield
and
questioning
why
she
had
not
been
given
into
*NL*
custody
that
morning
,
or
,
at
the
very
least
,
dismissed
from
her
master
's
*NL*
service
.
He
had
almost
as
much
as
declared
his
conviction
of
her
*NL*
criminality
last
night
:
what
mysterious
cause
withheld
him
from
accusing
*NL*
her
?
Why
had
he
enjoined
me
,
too
,
to
secrecy
?
It
was
strange
:
a
bold
,
*NL*
vindictive
,
and
haughty
gentleman
seemed
somehow
in
the
power
of
one
of
*NL*
the
meanest
of
his
dependants
;
so
much
in
her
power
,
that
even
when
she
*NL*
lifted
her
hand
against
his
life
,
he
dared
not
openly
charge
her
with
the
*NL*
attempt
,
much
less
punish
her
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
Grace
been
young
and
handsome
,
I
should
have
been
tempted
to
think
*NL*
that
tenderer
feelings
than
prudence
or
fear
influenced
Mr.
Rochester
in
*NL*
her
behalf
;
but
,
hard-favoured
and
matronly
as
she
was
,
the
idea
could
*NL*
not
be
admitted
.
``
Yet
,
''
I
reflected
,
``
she
has
been
young
once
;
her
youth
*NL*
would
be
contemporary
with
her
master
's
:
Mrs.
Fairfax
told
me
once
,
she
*NL*
had
lived
here
many
years
.
I
do
n't
think
she
can
ever
have
been
pretty
;
*NL*
but
,
for
aught
I
know
,
she
may
possess
originality
and
strength
of
*NL*
character
to
compensate
for
the
want
of
personal
advantages
.
Mr.
*NL*
Rochester
is
an
amateur
of
the
decided
and
eccentric
:
Grace
is
eccentric
*NL*
at
least
.
What
if
a
former
caprice
-LRB-
a
freak
very
possible
to
a
nature
so
*NL*
sudden
and
headstrong
as
his
-RRB-
has
delivered
him
into
her
power
,
and
she
*NL*
now
exercises
over
his
actions
a
secret
influence
,
the
result
of
his
own
*NL*
indiscretion
,
which
he
can
not
shake
off
,
and
dare
not
disregard
?
''
But
,
*NL*
having
reached
this
point
of
conjecture
,
Mrs.
Poole
's
square
,
flat
*NL*
figure
,
and
uncomely
,
dry
,
even
coarse
face
,
recurred
so
distinctly
to
my
*NL*
mind
's
eye
,
that
I
thought
,
``
No
;
impossible
!
my
supposition
can
not
be
*NL*
correct
.
Yet
,
''
suggested
the
secret
voice
which
talks
to
us
in
our
own
*NL*
hearts
,
``
you
are
not
beautiful
either
,
and
perhaps
Mr.
Rochester
approves
*NL*
you
:
at
any
rate
,
you
have
often
felt
as
if
he
did
;
and
last
*NL*
night
--
remember
his
words
;
remember
his
look
;
remember
his
voice
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
well
remembered
all
;
language
,
glance
,
and
tone
seemed
at
the
moment
*NL*
vividly
renewed
.
I
was
now
in
the
schoolroom
;
Adele
was
drawing
;
I
bent
*NL*
over
her
and
directed
her
pencil
.
She
looked
up
with
a
sort
of
start
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Qu
'
avez-vous
,
mademoiselle
?
''
said
she
.
``
Vos
doigts
tremblent
comme
la
*NL*
feuille
,
et
vos
joues
sont
rouges
:
mais
,
rouges
comme
des
cerises
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
hot
,
Adele
,
with
stooping
!
''
She
went
on
sketching
;
I
went
on
*NL*
thinking
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
hastened
to
drive
from
my
mind
the
hateful
notion
I
had
been
conceiving
*NL*
respecting
Grace
Poole
;
it
disgusted
me
.
I
compared
myself
with
her
,
and
*NL*
found
we
were
different
.
Bessie
Leaven
had
said
I
was
quite
a
lady
;
and
*NL*
she
spoke
truth
--
I
was
a
lady
.
And
now
I
looked
much
better
than
I
did
*NL*
when
Bessie
saw
me
;
I
had
more
colour
and
more
flesh
,
more
life
,
more
*NL*
vivacity
,
because
I
had
brighter
hopes
and
keener
enjoyments
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Evening
approaches
,
''
said
I
,
as
I
looked
towards
the
window
.
``
I
have
*NL*
never
heard
Mr.
Rochester
's
voice
or
step
in
the
house
to-day
;
but
surely
*NL*
I
shall
see
him
before
night
:
I
feared
the
meeting
in
the
morning
;
now
I
*NL*
desire
it
,
because
expectation
has
been
so
long
baffled
that
it
is
grown
*NL*
impatient
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
dusk
actually
closed
,
and
when
Adele
left
me
to
go
and
play
in
the
*NL*
nursery
with
Sophie
,
I
did
most
keenly
desire
it
.
I
listened
for
the
*NL*
bell
to
ring
below
;
I
listened
for
Leah
coming
up
with
a
message
;
I
*NL*
fancied
sometimes
I
heard
Mr.
Rochester
's
own
tread
,
and
I
turned
to
the
*NL*
door
,
expecting
it
to
open
and
admit
him
.
The
door
remained
shut
;
*NL*
darkness
only
came
in
through
the
window
.
Still
it
was
not
late
;
he
*NL*
often
sent
for
me
at
seven
and
eight
o'clock
,
and
it
was
yet
but
six
.
*NL*
Surely
I
should
not
be
wholly
disappointed
to-night
,
when
I
had
so
many
*NL*
things
to
say
to
him
!
I
wanted
again
to
introduce
the
subject
of
Grace
*NL*
Poole
,
and
to
hear
what
he
would
answer
;
I
wanted
to
ask
him
plainly
if
*NL*
he
really
believed
it
was
she
who
had
made
last
night
's
hideous
attempt
;
*NL*
and
if
so
,
why
he
kept
her
wickedness
a
secret
.
It
little
mattered
*NL*
whether
my
curiosity
irritated
him
;
I
knew
the
pleasure
of
vexing
and
*NL*
soothing
him
by
turns
;
it
was
one
I
chiefly
delighted
in
,
and
a
sure
*NL*
instinct
always
prevented
me
from
going
too
far
;
beyond
the
verge
of
*NL*
provocation
I
never
ventured
;
on
the
extreme
brink
I
liked
well
to
try
my
*NL*
skill
.
Retaining
every
minute
form
of
respect
,
every
propriety
of
my
*NL*
station
,
I
could
still
meet
him
in
argument
without
fear
or
uneasy
*NL*
restraint
;
this
suited
both
him
and
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
tread
creaked
on
the
stairs
at
last
.
Leah
made
her
appearance
;
but
it
*NL*
was
only
to
intimate
that
tea
was
ready
in
Mrs.
Fairfax
's
room
.
Thither
*NL*
I
repaired
,
glad
at
least
to
go
downstairs
;
for
that
brought
me
,
I
*NL*
imagined
,
nearer
to
Mr.
Rochester
's
presence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
want
your
tea
,
''
said
the
good
lady
,
as
I
joined
her
;
``
you
ate
*NL*
so
little
at
dinner
.
I
am
afraid
,
''
she
continued
,
``
you
are
not
well
to
-
*NL*
day
:
you
look
flushed
and
feverish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
quite
well
!
I
never
felt
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
must
prove
it
by
evincing
a
good
appetite
;
will
you
fill
the
*NL*
teapot
while
I
knit
off
this
needle
?
''
Having
completed
her
task
,
she
*NL*
rose
to
draw
down
the
blind
,
which
she
had
hitherto
kept
up
,
by
way
,
I
*NL*
suppose
,
of
making
the
most
of
daylight
,
though
dusk
was
now
fast
*NL*
deepening
into
total
obscurity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
fair
to-night
,
''
said
she
,
as
she
looked
through
the
panes
,
``
though
*NL*
not
starlight

Mr.
Rochester
has
,
on
the
whole

*NL*
*NL*
``
Journey

Is
Mr.

out

off

Mr.
Eshton
's
place
,
ten
miles
on
the
other
side
Millcote
.
I
believe
*NL*
there
is
quite
a
party
assembled
there
;
Lord
Ingram
,
Sir
George
Lynn

*NL*
Colonel
Dent

No

to-morrow
either

he

very

they
are
in
no

separate

Gentlemen
*NL*

are
often
in
request
on
such
occasions
;

Mr.
Rochester
is
*NL*
so
talented
and
so
lively
in
society
,
that
I
believe
he
is
a
general
*NL*
favourite
:
the
ladies
are
very
fond
of
him
;
though
you
would
not
think
*NL*
his
appearance
calculated
to
recommend
him
particularly
in
their
eyes

I
suppose
his
acquirements

abilities

perhaps
his
wealth

good

make
amends

``
Are
there

There
are
Mrs.

there

six

eighteen

She
came
here
to
a

Christmas
ball

party
Mr.

gave

have
seen
the
*NL*
dining-room
that
day

how
richly
it
was
decorated
,
how
brilliantly
lit
*NL*
up
!
I
should
think
there
were
fifty
ladies
and
gentlemen
present
--
all
of
*NL*
the
first
county
families

Miss

was
considered
the
belle
of

the
evening

You

Mrs.

was
she

Yes

I
saw
her

The
dining-room
doors
were
thrown
open

,
as
it
was

Christmas-time
,
the
servants
were
allowed
to
assemble
in
the
hall

to
*NL*
hear
some
of
the

sing

Mr.

would
have
me
to

come
in

I
sat
down
in
a
quiet
corner
and
watched
them
.
I
never
saw
*NL*
a
more
splendid
scene
:
the
ladies
were
magnificently
dressed
;
most
of
*NL*
them
--
at

most
of
the
younger
ones
--
looked
handsome

Miss

*NL*
was
certainly
the
queen

what
was
she

Tall

fine

dark

noble

eyes
rather
like
Mr.

Rochester
's
:
large

black
,
and
as
brilliant
as
her
jewels

And
then
*NL*
she
had
such
a
fine
head
of
hair
;
raven-black
and
so
becomingly
arranged
:
*NL*
a
crown
of
thick
plaits
behind
,
and
in
front
the
longest

the
glossiest
*NL*
curls
I
ever
saw

She
was
dressed
in
pure
white
;
an
amber-coloured
scarf
*NL*
was
passed
over
her
shoulder

across
her
breast
,
tied
at
the
side

*NL*
descending
in
long

fringed
ends
below

She
wore
an

amber-coloured

jetty

When
once
more
alone

I
reviewed
the
information

had
got

looked
into

my

examined
its
thoughts

endeavoured

bring

back
with
a

such

had
been

Arraigned
at

been
cherishing

of
the

state

I
had
indulged
for
nearly
a

Reason

having
come
forward

told

in

quiet
way
a
plain

unvarnished

tale

showing
how
I
had
rejected
the
real

and
rabidly
devoured
the
*NL*
ideal

I
pronounced
judgment
to
this
effect

--
*NL*
*NL*
That
a
greater
fool
than
Jane

never
breathed
the
breath
of
life
;
*NL*
that
a
more
fantastic
idiot
had
never
surfeited
herself
on
sweet

and
swallowed
poison
as
if
it
were
nectar

*NL*
''
_
You

I
said

tokens
shown
by
a
gentleman

a
man

of

How

it

madness

kindle

insignificant
plebeian

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
do
it

this
determination

I
grew
*NL*
calm

and
fell
asleep

*NL*
*NL*
I
kept
my
word

An
hour
or
two
sufficed
to
sketch
my
own
portrait
in
*NL*
crayons
;
and
in
less
than
a
fortnight
I
had
completed
an
ivory
miniature
*NL*
of
an
imaginary
Blanche
Ingram
.
It
looked
a
lovely
face
enough
,
and
when
*NL*
compared
with
the
real
head
in
chalk
,
the
contrast
was
as
great
as
self
-
*NL*
control
could
desire
.
I
derived
benefit
from
the
task
:
it
had
kept
my
*NL*
head
and
hands
employed
,
and
had
given
force
and
fixedness
to
the
new
*NL*
impressions
I
wished
to
stamp
indelibly
on
my
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ere
long
,
I
had
reason
to
congratulate
myself
on
the
course
of
wholesome
*NL*
discipline
to
which
I
had
thus
forced
my
feelings
to
submit
.
Thanks
to
*NL*
it
,
I
was
able
to
meet
subsequent
occurrences
with
a
decent
calm
,
which
,
*NL*
had
they
found
me
unprepared
,
I
should
probably
have
been
unequal
to
*NL*
maintain

even
externally

CHAPTER
XVII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
week
passed
,
and
no
news
arrived
of
Mr.
Rochester
:
ten
days
,
and
still
*NL*
he
did
not
come
.
Mrs.
Fairfax
said
she
should
not
be
surprised
if
he
*NL*
were
to
go
straight
from
the
Leas
to
London
,
and
thence
to
the
Continent
,
*NL*
and
not
show
his
face
again
at
Thornfield
for
a
year
to
come
;
he
had
not
*NL*
unfrequently
quitted
it
in
a
manner
quite
as
abrupt
and
unexpected
.
When
*NL*
I
heard
this
,
I
was
beginning
to
feel
a
strange
chill
and
failing
at
the
*NL*
heart
.
I
was
actually
permitting
myself
to
experience
a
sickening
sense
*NL*
of
disappointment
;
but
rallying
my
wits
,
and
recollecting
my
principles
,
*NL*
I
at
once
called
my
sensations
to
order
;
and
it
was
wonderful
how
I
got
*NL*
over
the
temporary
blunder
--
how
I
cleared
up
the
mistake
of
supposing
Mr.
*NL*
Rochester
's
movements
a
matter
in
which
I
had
any
cause
to
take
a
vital
*NL*
interest
.
Not
that
I
humbled
myself
by
a
slavish
notion
of
inferiority
:
*NL*
on
the
contrary
,
I
just
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
master
of
Thornfield
,
further
than
to
*NL*
receive
the
salary
he
gives
you
for
teaching
his
protegee
,
and
to
be
*NL*
grateful
for
such
respectful
and
kind
treatment
as
,
if
you
do
your
duty
,
*NL*
you
have
a
right
to
expect
at
his
hands
.
Be
sure
that
is
the
only
tie
he
*NL*
seriously
acknowledges
between
you
and
him
;
so
do
n't
make
him
the
object
*NL*
of
your
fine
feelings
,
your
raptures
,
agonies
,
and
so
forth
.
He
is
not
*NL*
of
your
order
:
keep
to
your
caste
,
and
be
too
self-respecting
to
lavish
*NL*
the
love
of
the
whole
heart
,
soul
,
and
strength
,
where
such
a
gift
is
not
*NL*
wanted
and
would
be
despised
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
on
with
my
day
's
business
tranquilly
;
but
ever
and
anon
vague
*NL*
suggestions
kept
wandering
across
my
brain
of
reasons
why
I
should
quit
*NL*
Thornfield
;
and
I
kept
involuntarily
framing
advertisements
and
pondering
*NL*
conjectures
about
new
situations
:
these
thoughts
I
did
not
think
to
*NL*
check
;
they
might
germinate
and
bear
fruit
if
they
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Rochester
had
been
absent
upwards
of
a
fortnight
,
when
the
post
*NL*
brought
Mrs.
Fairfax
a
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
from
the
master
,
''
said
she
,
as
she
looked
at
the
direction
.
``
Now
*NL*
I
suppose
we
shall
know
whether
we
are
to
expect
his
return
or
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
while
she
broke
the
seal
and
perused
the
document
,
I
went
on
taking
*NL*
my
coffee
-LRB-
we
were
at
breakfast
-RRB-
:
it
was
hot
,
and
I
attributed
to
that
*NL*
circumstance
a
fiery
glow
which
suddenly
rose
to
my
face
.
Why
my
hand
*NL*
shook
,
and
why
I
involuntarily
spilt
half
the
contents
of
my
cup
into
my
*NL*
saucer
,
I
did
not
choose
to
consider
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
sometimes
think
we
are
too
quiet
;
but
we
run
a
chance
of
being
*NL*
busy
enough
now
:
for
a
little
while
at
least
,
''
said
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
still
*NL*
holding
the
note
before
her
spectacles
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ere
I
permitted
myself
to
request
an
explanation
,
I
tied
the
string
of
*NL*
Adele
's
pinafore
,
which
happened
to
be
loose
:
having
helped
her
also
to
*NL*
another
bun
and
refilled
her
mug
with
milk
,
I
said
,
nonchalantly
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Rochester
is
not
likely
to
return
soon
,
I
suppose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
he
is
--
in
three
days
,
he
says
:
that
will
be
next
Thursday
;
and
*NL*
not
alone
either
.
I
do
n't
know
how
many
of
the
fine
people
at
the
Leas
*NL*
are
coming
with
him
:
he
sends
directions
for
all
the
best
bedrooms
to
be
*NL*
prepared
;
and
the
library
and
drawing-rooms
are
to
be
cleaned
out
;
I
am
*NL*
to
get
more
kitchen
hands
from
the
George
Inn
,
at
Millcote
,
and
from
*NL*
wherever
else
I
can
;
and
the
ladies
will
bring
their
maids
and
the
*NL*
gentlemen
their
valets
:
so
we
shall
have
a
full
house
of
it
.
''
And
Mrs.
*NL*
Fairfax
swallowed
her
breakfast
and
hastened
away
to
commence
operations
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
three
days
were
,
as
she
had
foretold
,
busy
enough
.
I
had
thought
all
*NL*
the
rooms
at
Thornfield
beautifully
clean
and
well
arranged
;
but
it
*NL*
appears
I
was
mistaken
.
Three
women
were
got
to
help
;
and
such
*NL*
scrubbing
,
such
brushing
,
such
washing
of
paint
and
beating
of
carpets
,
*NL*
such
taking
down
and
putting
up
of
pictures
,
such
polishing
of
mirrors
*NL*
and
lustres
,
such
lighting
of
fires
in
bedrooms
,
such
airing
of
sheets
*NL*
and
feather-beds
on
hearths
,
I
never
beheld
,
either
before
or
since
.
*NL*
Adele
ran
quite
wild
in
the
midst
of
it
:
the
preparations
for
company
and
*NL*
the
prospect
of
their
arrival
,
seemed
to
throw
her
into
ecstasies
.
She
*NL*
would
have
Sophie
to
look
over
all
her
``
toilettes
,
''
as
she
called
frocks
;
*NL*
to
furbish
up
any
that
were
''
_
passees
_
,
''
and
to
air
and
arrange
the
new
.
*NL*
For
herself
,
she
did
nothing
but
caper
about
in
the
front
chambers
,
jump
*NL*
on
and
off
the
bedsteads
,
and
lie
on
the
mattresses
and
piled-up
bolsters
*NL*
and
pillows
before
the
enormous
fires
roaring
in
the
chimneys
.
From
*NL*
school
duties
she
was
exonerated
:
Mrs.
Fairfax
had
pressed
me
into
her
*NL*
service
,
and
I
was
all
day
in
the
storeroom
,
helping
-LRB-
or
hindering
-RRB-
her
*NL*
and
the
cook
;
learning
to
make
custards
and
cheese-cakes
and
French
*NL*
pastry
,
to
truss
game
and
garnish
desert-dishes
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
party
were
expected
to
arrive
on
Thursday
afternoon
,
in
time
for
*NL*
dinner
at
six
.
During
the
intervening
period
I
had
no
time
to
nurse
*NL*
chimeras
;
and
I
believe
I
was
as
active
and
gay
as
anybody
--
Adele
*NL*
excepted
.
Still
,
now
and
then
,
I
received
a
damping
check
to
my
*NL*
cheerfulness
;
and
was
,
in
spite
of
myself
,
thrown
back
on
the
region
of
*NL*
doubts
and
portents
,
and
dark
conjectures
.
This
was
when
I
chanced
to
*NL*
see
the
third-storey
staircase
door
-LRB-
which
of
late
had
always
been
kept
*NL*
locked
-RRB-
open
slowly
,
and
give
passage
to
the
form
of
Grace
Poole
,
in
prim
*NL*
cap
,
white
apron
,
and
handkerchief
;
when
I
watched
her
glide
along
the
*NL*
gallery
,
her
quiet
tread
muffled
in
a
list
slipper
;
when
I
saw
her
look
*NL*
into
the
bustling
,
topsy-turvy
bedrooms
,
--
just
say
a
word
,
perhaps
,
to
*NL*
the
charwoman
about
the
proper
way
to
polish
a
grate
,
or
clean
a
marble
*NL*
mantelpiece
,
or
take
stains
from
papered
walls
,
and
then
pass
on
.
She
*NL*
would
thus
descend
to
the
kitchen
once
a
day
,
eat
her
dinner
,
smoke
a
*NL*
moderate
pipe
on
the
hearth
,
and
go
back
,
carrying
her
pot
of
porter
with
*NL*
her
,
for
her
private
solace
,
in
her
own
gloomy
,
upper
haunt
.
Only
one
*NL*
hour
in
the
twenty-four
did
she
pass
with
her
fellow-servants
below
;
all
*NL*
the
rest
of
her
time
was
spent
in
some
low-ceiled
,
oaken
chamber
of
the
*NL*
second
storey
:
there
she
sat
and
sewed
--
and
probably
laughed
drearily
to
*NL*
herself
,
--
as
companionless
as
a
prisoner
in
his
dungeon
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
strangest
thing
of
all
was
,
that
not
a
soul
in
the
house
,
except
me
,
*NL*
noticed
her
habits
,
or
seemed
to
marvel
at
them
:
no
one
discussed
her
*NL*
position
or
employment
;
no
one
pitied
her
solitude
or
isolation
.
I
once
,
*NL*
indeed
,
overheard
part
of
a
dialogue
between
Leah
and
one
of
the
*NL*
charwomen
,
of
which
Grace
formed
the
subject
.
Leah
had
been
saying
*NL*
something
I
had
not
caught
,
and
the
charwoman
remarked
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
gets
good
wages
,
I
guess
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Leah
;
``
I
wish
I
had
as
good
;
not
that
mine
are
to
complain
*NL*
of
,
--
there
's
no
stinginess
at
Thornfield
;
but
they
're
not
one
fifth
of
*NL*
the
sum
Mrs.
Poole
receives
.
And
she
is
laying
by
:
she
goes
every
*NL*
quarter
to
the
bank
at
Millcote
.
I
should
not
wonder
but
she
has
saved
*NL*
enough
to
keep
her
independent
if
she
liked
to
leave
;
but
I
suppose
she
's
*NL*
got
used
to
the
place
;
and
then
she
's
not
forty
yet
,
and
strong
and
able
*NL*
for
anything
.
It
is
too
soon
for
her
to
give
up
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
a
good
hand
,
I
daresay
,
''
said
the
charwoman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
--
she
understands
what
she
has
to
do
,
--
nobody
better
,
''
rejoined
Leah
*NL*
significantly
;
``
and
it
is
not
every
one
could
fill
her
shoes
--
not
for
all
*NL*
the
money
she
gets
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
it
is
not
!
''
was
the
reply
.
``
I
wonder
whether
the
master
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
charwoman
was
going
on
;
but
here
Leah
turned
and
perceived
me
,
and
*NL*
she
instantly
gave
her
companion
a
nudge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
n't
she
know
?
''
I
heard
the
woman
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leah
shook
her
head
,
and
the
conversation
was
of
course
dropped
.
All
I
*NL*
had
gathered
from
it
amounted
to
this
,
--
that
there
was
a
mystery
at
*NL*
Thornfield
;
and
that
from
participation
in
that
mystery
I
was
purposely
*NL*
excluded
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thursday
came
:
all
work
had
been
completed
the
previous
evening
;
carpets
*NL*
were
laid
down
,
bed-hangings
festooned
,
radiant
white
counterpanes
*NL*
spread
,
toilet
tables
arranged
,
furniture
rubbed
,
flowers
piled
in
vases
:
*NL*
both
chambers
and
saloons
looked
as
fresh
and
bright
as
hands
could
make
*NL*
them
.
The
hall
,
too
,
was
scoured
;
and
the
great
carved
clock
,
as
well
as
*NL*
the
steps
and
banisters
of
the
staircase
,
were
polished
to
the
brightness
*NL*
of
glass
;
in
the
dining-room
,
the
sideboard
flashed
resplendent
with
*NL*
plate
;
in
the
drawing-room
and
boudoir
,
vases
of
exotics
bloomed
on
all
*NL*
sides
.
*NL*
*NL*
Afternoon
arrived
:
Mrs.
Fairfax
assumed
her
best
black
satin
gown
,
her
*NL*
gloves
,
and
her
gold
watch
;
for
it
was
her
part
to
receive
the
*NL*
company
,
--
to
conduct
the
ladies
to
their
rooms
,
&
c.
Adele
,
too
,
would
be
*NL*
dressed
:
though
I
thought
she
had
little
chance
of
being
introduced
to
*NL*
the
party
that
day
at
least
.
However
,
to
please
her
,
I
allowed
Sophie
to
*NL*
apparel
her
in
one
of
her
short
,
full
muslin
frocks
.
For
myself
,
I
had
*NL*
no
need
to
make
any
change
;
I
should
not
be
called
upon
to
quit
my
*NL*
sanctum
of
the
schoolroom
;
for
a
sanctum
it
was
now
become
to
me
,
--
``
a
*NL*
very
pleasant
refuge
in
time
of
trouble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
been
a
mild
,
serene
spring
day
--
one
of
those
days
which
,
towards
*NL*
the
end
of
March
or
the
beginning
of
April
,
rise
shining
over
the
earth
*NL*
as
heralds
of
summer
.
It
was
drawing
to
an
end
now
;
but
the
evening
was
*NL*
even
warm
,
and
I
sat
at
work
in
the
schoolroom
with
the
window
open
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
gets
late
,
''
said
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
entering
in
rustling
state
.
``
I
am
*NL*
glad
I
ordered
dinner
an
hour
after
the
time
Mr.
Rochester
mentioned
;
for
*NL*
it
is
past
six
now
.
I
have
sent
John
down
to
the
gates
to
see
if
there
*NL*
is
anything
on
the
road
:
one
can
see
a
long
way
from
thence
in
the
*NL*
direction
of
Millcote
.
''
She
went
to
the
window
.
``
Here
he
is
!
''
said
she
.
*NL*
``
Well
,
John
''
-LRB-
leaning
out
-RRB-
,
``
any
news
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
coming
,
ma'am
,
''
was
the
answer
.
``
They
'll
be
here
in
ten
*NL*
minutes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adele
flew
to
the
window
.
I
followed
,
taking
care
to
stand
on
one
side
,
*NL*
so
that
,
screened
by
the
curtain
,
I
could
see
without
being
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ten
minutes
John
had
given
seemed
very
long
,
but
at
last
wheels
were
*NL*
heard
;
four
equestrians
galloped
up
the
drive
,
and
after
them
came
two
*NL*
open
carriages
.
Fluttering
veils
and
waving
plumes
filled
the
vehicles
;
*NL*
two
of
the
cavaliers
were
young
,
dashing-looking
gentlemen
;
the
third
was
*NL*
Mr.
Rochester
,
on
his
black
horse
,
Mesrour
,
Pilot
bounding
before
him
;
at
*NL*
his
side
rode
a
lady
,
and
he
and
she
were
the
first
of
the
party
.
Her
*NL*
purple
riding-habit
almost
swept
the
ground
,
her
veil
streamed
long
on
*NL*
the
breeze
;
mingling
with
its
transparent
folds
,
and
gleaming
through
*NL*
them
,
shone
rich
raven
ringlets
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Ingram
!
''
exclaimed
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
and
away
she
hurried
to
her
post
*NL*
below
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cavalcade
,
following
the
sweep
of
the
drive
,
quickly
turned
the
angle
*NL*
of
the
house
,
and
I
lost
sight
of
it
.
Adele
now
petitioned
to
go
down
;
*NL*
but
I
took
her
on
my
knee
,
and
gave
her
to
understand
that
she
must
not
*NL*
on
any
account
think
of
venturing
in
sight
of
the
ladies
,
either
now
or
*NL*
at
any
other
time
,
unless
expressly
sent
for
:
that
Mr.
Rochester
would
be
*NL*
very
angry
,
&
c.
``
Some
natural
tears
she
shed
''
on
being
told
this
;
but
as
*NL*
I
began
to
look
very
grave
,
she
consented
at
last
to
wipe
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
joyous
stir
was
now
audible
in
the
hall
:
gentlemen
's
deep
tones
and
*NL*
ladies
'
silvery
accents
blent
harmoniously
together
,
and
distinguishable
*NL*
above
all
,
though
not
loud
,
was
the
sonorous
voice
of
the
master
of
*NL*
Thornfield
Hall
,
welcoming
his
fair
and
gallant
guests
under
its
roof
.
*NL*
Then
light
steps
ascended
the
stairs
;
and
there
was
a
tripping
through
*NL*
the
gallery
,
and
soft
cheerful
laughs
,
and
opening
and
closing
doors
,
*NL*
and
,
for
a
time
,
a
hush
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Elles
changent
de
toilettes
,
''
said
Adele
;
who
,
listening
attentively
,
*NL*
had
followed
every
movement
;
and
she
sighed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Chez
maman
,
''
said
she
,
``
quand
il
y
avait
du
monde
,
je
le
suivais
*NL*
partout
,
au
salon
et
a
leurs
chambres
;
souvent
je
regardais
les
femmes
de
*NL*
chambre
coiffer
et
habiller
les
dames
,
et
c
`
etait
si
amusant
:
comme
cela
*NL*
on
apprend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
feel
hungry
,
Adele
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mais
oui
,
mademoiselle
:
voila
cinq
ou
six
heures
que
nous
n'avons
pas
*NL*
mange
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
while
the
ladies
are
in
their
rooms
,
I
will
venture
down
and
*NL*
get
you
something
to
eat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
issuing
from
my
asylum
with
precaution
,
I
sought
a
back-stairs
which
*NL*
conducted
directly
to
the
kitchen
.
All
in
that
region
was
fire
and
*NL*
commotion
;
the
soup
and
fish
were
in
the
last
stage
of
projection
,
and
*NL*
the
cook
hung
over
her
crucibles
in
a
frame
of
mind
and
body
threatening
*NL*
spontaneous
combustion
.
In
the
servants
'
hall
two
coachmen
and
three
*NL*
gentlemen
's
gentlemen
stood
or
sat
round
the
fire
;
the
abigails
,
I
*NL*
suppose
,
were
upstairs
with
their
mistresses
;
the
new
servants
,
that
had
*NL*
been
hired
from
Millcote
,
were
bustling
about
everywhere
.
Threading
this
*NL*
chaos
,
I
at
last
reached
the
larder
;
there
I
took
possession
of
a
cold
*NL*
chicken
,
a
roll
of
bread
,
some
tarts
,
a
plate
or
two
and
a
knife
and
*NL*
fork
:
with
this
booty
I
made
a
hasty
retreat
.
I
had
regained
the
*NL*
gallery
,
and
was
just
shutting
the
back-door
behind
me
,
when
an
*NL*
accelerated
hum
warned
me
that
the
ladies
were
about
to
issue
from
their
*NL*
chambers
.
I
could
not
proceed
to
the
schoolroom
without
passing
some
of
*NL*
their
doors
,
and
running
the
risk
of
being
surprised
with
my
cargo
of
*NL*
victualage
;
so
I
stood
still
at
this
end
,
which
,
being
windowless
,
was
*NL*
dark
:
quite
dark
now
,
for
the
sun
was
set
and
twilight
gathering
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
the
chambers
gave
up
their
fair
tenants
one
after
another
:
each
*NL*
came
out
gaily
and
airily
,
with
dress
that
gleamed
lustrous
through
the
*NL*
dusk
.
For
a
moment
they
stood
grouped
together
at
the
other
extremity
of
*NL*
the
gallery
,
conversing
in
a
key
of
sweet
subdued
vivacity
:
they
then
*NL*
descended
the
staircase
almost
as
noiselessly
as
a
bright
mist
rolls
down
*NL*
a
hill
.
Their
collective
appearance
had
left
on
me
an
impression
of
high
-
*NL*
born
elegance
,
such
as
I
had
never
before
received
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
found
Adele
peeping
through
the
schoolroom
door
,
which
she
held
ajar
.
*NL*
``
What
beautiful
ladies
!
''
cried
she
in
English
.
``
Oh
,
I
wish
I
might
go
to
*NL*
them
!
Do
you
think
Mr.
Rochester
will
send
for
us
by-and-bye
,
after
*NL*
dinner
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
indeed
,
I
do
n't
;
Mr.
Rochester
has
something
else
to
think
about
.
*NL*
Never
mind
the
ladies
to-night
;
perhaps
you
will
see
them
to-morrow
:
here
*NL*
is
your
dinner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
really
hungry
,
so
the
chicken
and
tarts
served
to
divert
her
*NL*
attention
for
a
time
.
It
was
well
I
secured
this
forage
,
or
both
she
,
I
,
*NL*
and
Sophie
,
to
whom
I
conveyed
a
share
of
our
repast
,
would
have
run
a
*NL*
chance
of
getting
no
dinner
at
all
:
every
one
downstairs
was
too
much
*NL*
engaged
to
think
of
us
.
The
dessert
was
not
carried
out
till
after
nine
*NL*
and
at
ten
footmen
were
still
running
to
and
fro
with
trays
and
coffee
-
*NL*
cups
.
I
allowed
Adele
to
sit
up
much
later
than
usual
;
for
she
declared
*NL*
she
could
not
possibly
go
to
sleep
while
the
doors
kept
opening
and
*NL*
shutting
below
,
and
people
bustling
about
.
Besides
,
she
added
,
a
message
*NL*
might
possibly
come
from
Mr.
Rochester
when
she
was
undressed
;
``
et
alors
*NL*
quel
dommage
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
her
stories
as
long
as
she
would
listen
to
them
;
and
then
for
a
*NL*
change
I
took
her
out
into
the
gallery
.
The
hall
lamp
was
now
lit
,
and
*NL*
it
amused
her
to
look
over
the
balustrade
and
watch
the
servants
passing
*NL*
backwards
and
forwards
.
When
the
evening
was
far
advanced
,
a
sound
of
*NL*
music
issued
from
the
drawing-room
,
whither
the
piano
had
been
removed
;
*NL*
Adele
and
I
sat
down
on
the
top
step
of
the
stairs
to
listen
.
Presently
*NL*
a
voice
blent
with
the
rich
tones
of
the
instrument
;
it
was
a
lady
who
*NL*
sang
,
and
very
sweet
her
notes
were
.
The
solo
over
,
a
duet
followed
,
and
*NL*
then
a
glee
:
a
joyous
conversational
murmur
filled
up
the
intervals
.
I
*NL*
listened
long
:
suddenly
I
discovered
that
my
ear
was
wholly
intent
on
*NL*
analysing
the
mingled
sounds
,
and
trying
to
discriminate
amidst
the
*NL*
confusion
of
accents
those
of
Mr.
Rochester
;
and
when
it
caught
them
,
*NL*
which
it
soon
did
,
it
found
a
further
task
in
framing
the
tones
,
rendered
*NL*
by
distance
inarticulate
,
into
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
clock
struck
eleven
.
I
looked
at
Adele
,
whose
head
leant
against
my
*NL*
shoulder
;
her
eyes
were
waxing
heavy
,
so
I
took
her
up
in
my
arms
and
*NL*
carried
her
off
to
bed
.
It
was
near
one
before
the
gentlemen
and
ladies
*NL*
sought
their
chambers
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
was
as
fine
as
its
predecessor
:
it
was
devoted
by
the
party
*NL*
to
an
excursion
to
some
site
in
the
neighbourhood
.
They
set
out
early
in
*NL*
the
forenoon
,
some
on
horseback
,
the
rest
in
carriages
;
I
witnessed
both
*NL*
the
departure
and
the
return
.
Miss
Ingram
,
as
before
,
was
the
only
lady
*NL*
equestrian
;
and
,
as
before
,
Mr.
Rochester
galloped
at
her
side
;
the
two
*NL*
rode
a
little
apart
from
the
rest
.
I
pointed
out
this
circumstance
to
*NL*
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
who
was
standing
at
the
window
with
me
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
said
it
was
not
likely
they
should
think
of
being
married
,
''
said
I
,
*NL*
``
but
you
see
Mr.
Rochester
evidently
prefers
her
to
any
of
the
other
*NL*
ladies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
daresay
:
no
doubt
he
admires
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
she
him
,
''
I
added
;
``
look
how
she
leans
her
head
towards
him
as
if
*NL*
she
were
conversing
confidentially
;
I
wish
I
could
see
her
face
;
I
have
*NL*
never
had
a
glimpse
of
it
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
see
her
this
evening
,
''
answered
Mrs.
Fairfax
.
``
I
happened
to
*NL*
remark
to
Mr.
Rochester
how
much
Adele
wished
to
be
introduced
to
the
*NL*
ladies
,
and
he
said
:
`
Oh
!
let
her
come
into
the
drawing-room
after
*NL*
dinner
;
and
request
Miss
Eyre
to
accompany
her
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
he
said
that
from
mere
politeness
:
I
need
not
go
,
I
am
sure
,
''
I
*NL*
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
observed
to
him
that
as
you
were
unused
to
company
,
I
did
not
*NL*
think
you
would
like
appearing
before
so
gay
a
party
--
all
strangers
;
and
*NL*
he
replied
,
in
his
quick
way
--
`
Nonsense
!
If
she
objects
,
tell
her
it
is
*NL*
my
particular
wish
;
and
if
she
resists
,
say
I
shall
come
and
fetch
her
in
*NL*
case
of
contumacy
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not
give
him
that
trouble
,
''
I
answered
.
``
I
will
go
,
if
no
better
*NL*
may
be
;
but
I
do
n't
like
it
.
Shall
you
be
there
,
Mrs.
Fairfax
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
pleaded
off
,
and
he
admitted
my
plea
.
I
'll
tell
you
how
to
manage
*NL*
so
as
to
avoid
the
embarrassment
of
making
a
formal
entrance
,
which
is
*NL*
the
most
disagreeable
part
of
the
business
.
You
must
go
into
the
drawing
-
*NL*
room
while
it
is
empty
,
before
the
ladies
leave
the
dinner-table
;
choose
*NL*
your
seat
in
any
quiet
nook
you
like
;
you
need
not
stay
long
after
the
*NL*
gentlemen
come
in
,
unless
you
please
:
just
let
Mr.
Rochester
see
you
are
*NL*
there
and
then
slip
away
--
nobody
will
notice
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
these
people
remain
long
,
do
you
think
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
two
or
three
weeks
,
certainly
not
more
.
After
the
Easter
*NL*
recess
,
Sir
George
Lynn
,
who
was
lately
elected
member
for
Millcote
,
will
*NL*
have
to
go
up
to
town
and
take
his
seat
;
I
daresay
Mr.
Rochester
will
*NL*
accompany
him
:
it
surprises
me
that
he
has
already
made
so
protracted
a
*NL*
stay
at
Thornfield
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
with
some
trepidation
that
I
perceived
the
hour
approach
when
I
*NL*
was
to
repair
with
my
charge
to
the
drawing-room
.
Adele
had
been
in
a
*NL*
state
of
ecstasy
all
day
,
after
hearing
she
was
to
be
presented
to
the
*NL*
ladies
in
the
evening
;
and
it
was
not
till
Sophie
commenced
the
operation
*NL*
of
dressing
her
that
she
sobered
down
.
Then
the
importance
of
the
*NL*
process
quickly
steadied
her
,
and
by
the
time
she
had
her
curls
arranged
*NL*
in
well-smoothed
,
drooping
clusters
,
her
pink
satin
frock
put
on
,
her
*NL*
long
sash
tied
,
and
her
lace
mittens
adjusted
,
she
looked
as
grave
as
any
*NL*
judge
.
No
need
to
warn
her
not
to
disarrange
her
attire
:
when
she
was
*NL*
dressed
,
she
sat
demurely
down
in
her
little
chair
,
taking
care
*NL*
previously
to
lift
up
the
satin
skirt
for
fear
she
should
crease
it
,
and
*NL*
assured
me
she
would
not
stir
thence
till
I
was
ready
.
This
I
quickly
*NL*
was
:
my
best
dress
-LRB-
the
silver-grey
one
,
purchased
for
Miss
Temple
's
*NL*
wedding
,
and
never
worn
since
-RRB-
was
soon
put
on
;
my
hair
was
soon
*NL*
smoothed
;
my
sole
ornament
,
the
pearl
brooch
,
soon
assumed
.
We
*NL*
descended
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fortunately
there
was
another
entrance
to
the
drawing-room
than
that
*NL*
through
the
saloon
where
they
were
all
seated
at
dinner
.
We
found
the
*NL*
apartment
vacant
;
a
large
fire
burning
silently
on
the
marble
hearth
,
and
*NL*
wax
candles
shining
in
bright
solitude
,
amid
the
exquisite
flowers
with
*NL*
which
the
tables
were
adorned
.
The
crimson
curtain
hung
before
the
arch
:
*NL*
slight
as
was
the
separation
this
drapery
formed
from
the
party
in
the
*NL*
adjoining
saloon
,
they
spoke
in
so
low
a
key
that
nothing
of
their
*NL*
conversation
could
be
distinguished
beyond
a
soothing
murmur
.
*NL*
*NL*
Adele
,
who
appeared
to
be
still
under
the
influence
of
a
most
solemnising
*NL*
impression
,
sat
down
,
without
a
word
,
on
the
footstool
I
pointed
out
to
*NL*
her
.
I
retired
to
a
window-seat
,
and
taking
a
book
from
a
table
near
,
*NL*
endeavoured
to
read
.
Adele
brought
her
stool
to
my
feet
;
ere
long
she
*NL*
touched
my
knee
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
,
Adele
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Est-ce
que
je
ne
puis
pas
prendrie
une
seule
de
ces
fleurs
magnifiques
,
*NL*
mademoiselle
?
Seulement
pour
completer
ma
toilette
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
think
too
much
of
your
`
toilette
,
'
Adele
:
but
you
may
have
a
*NL*
flower
.
''
And
I
took
a
rose
from
a
vase
and
fastened
it
in
her
sash
.
She
*NL*
sighed
a
sigh
of
ineffable
satisfaction
,
as
if
her
cup
of
happiness
were
*NL*
now
full
.
I
turned
my
face
away
to
conceal
a
smile
I
could
not
suppress
:
*NL*
there
was
something
ludicrous
as
well
as
painful
in
the
little
*NL*
Parisienne
's
earnest
and
innate
devotion
to
matters
of
dress
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
soft
sound
of
rising
now
became
audible
;
the
curtain
was
swept
back
*NL*
from
the
arch
;
through
it
appeared
the
dining-room
,
with
its
lit
lustre
*NL*
pouring
down
light
on
the
silver
and
glass
of
a
magnificent
*NL*
dessert-service
covering
a
long
table
;
a
band
of
ladies
stood
in
the
*NL*
opening
;
they
entered
,
and
the
curtain
fell
behind
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
but
eight
;
yet
,
somehow
,
as
they
flocked
in
,
they
gave
the
*NL*
impression
of
a
much
larger
number
.
Some
of
them
were
very
tall
;
many
*NL*
were
dressed
in
white
;
and
all
had
a
sweeping
amplitude
of
array
that
*NL*
seemed
to
magnify
their
persons
as
a
mist
magnifies
the
moon
.
I
rose
and
*NL*
curtseyed
to
them
:
one
or
two
bent
their
heads
in
return
,
the
others
only
*NL*
stared
at
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
dispersed
about
the
room
,
reminding
me
,
by
the
lightness
and
*NL*
buoyancy
of
their
movements
,
of
a
flock
of
white
plumy
birds
.
Some
of
*NL*
them
threw
themselves
in
half-reclining
positions
on
the
sofas
and
*NL*
ottomans
:
some
bent
over
the
tables
and
examined
the
flowers
and
books
:
*NL*
the
rest
gathered
in
a
group
round
the
fire
:
all
talked
in
a
low
but
*NL*
clear
tone
which
seemed
habitual
to
them
.
I
knew
their
names
afterwards
,
*NL*
and
may
as
well
mention
them
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
First
,
there
was
Mrs.
Eshton
and
two
of
her
daughters
.
She
had
evidently
*NL*
been
a
handsome
woman
,
and
was
well
preserved
still
.
Of
her
daughters
,
*NL*
the
eldest
,
Amy
,
was
rather
little
:
naive
,
and
child-like
in
face
and
*NL*
manner
,
and
piquant
in
form
;
her
white
muslin
dress
and
blue
sash
became
*NL*
her
well
.
The
second
,
Louisa
,
was
taller
and
more
elegant
in
figure
;
*NL*
with
a
very
pretty
face
,
of
that
order
the
French
term
_
minois
chiffone
_
:
*NL*
both
sisters
were
fair
as
lilies
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Lynn
was
a
large
and
stout
personage
of
about
forty
,
very
erect
,
*NL*
very
haughty-looking
,
richly
dressed
in
a
satin
robe
of
changeful
sheen
:
*NL*
her
dark
hair
shone
glossily
under
the
shade
of
an
azure
plume
,
and
*NL*
within
the
circlet
of
a
band
of
gems
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Colonel
Dent
was
less
showy
;
but
,
I
thought
,
more
lady-like
.
She
*NL*
had
a
slight
figure
,
a
pale
,
gentle
face
,
and
fair
hair
.
Her
black
satin
*NL*
dress
,
her
scarf
of
rich
foreign
lace
,
and
her
pearl
ornaments
,
pleased
*NL*
me
better
than
the
rainbow
radiance
of
the
titled
dame
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
three
most
distinguished
--
partly
,
perhaps
,
because
the
tallest
*NL*
figures
of
the
band
--
were
the
Dowager
Lady
Ingram
and
her
daughters
,
*NL*
Blanche
and
Mary
.
They
were
all
three
of
the
loftiest
stature
of
women
.
*NL*
The
Dowager
might
be
between
forty
and
fifty
:
her
shape
was
still
fine
;
*NL*
her
hair
-LRB-
by
candle-light
at
least
-RRB-
still
black
;
her
teeth
,
too
,
were
*NL*
still
apparently
perfect
.
Most
people
would
have
termed
her
a
splendid
*NL*
woman
of
her
age
:
and
so
she
was
,
no
doubt
,
physically
speaking
;
but
then
*NL*
there
was
an
expression
of
almost
insupportable
haughtiness
in
her
*NL*
bearing
and
countenance
.
She
had
Roman
features
and
a
double
chin
,
*NL*
disappearing
into
a
throat
like
a
pillar
:
these
features
appeared
to
me
*NL*
not
only
inflated
and
darkened
,
but
even
furrowed
with
pride
;
and
the
*NL*
chin
was
sustained
by
the
same
principle
,
in
a
position
of
almost
*NL*
preternatural
erectness
.
She
had
,
likewise
,
a
fierce
and
a
hard
eye
:
it
*NL*
reminded
me
of
Mrs.
Reed
's
;
she
mouthed
her
words
in
speaking
;
her
voice
*NL*
was
deep
,
its
inflections
very
pompous
,
very
dogmatical
,
--
very
*NL*
intolerable
,
in
short
.
A
crimson
velvet
robe
,
and
a
shawl
turban
of
some
*NL*
gold-wrought
Indian
fabric
,
invested
her
-LRB-
I
suppose
she
thought
-RRB-
with
a
*NL*
truly
imperial
dignity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Blanche
and
Mary
were
of
equal
stature
,
--
straight
and
tall
as
poplars
.
*NL*
Mary
was
too
slim
for
her
height
,
but
Blanche
was
moulded
like
a
Dian
.
I
*NL*
regarded
her
,
of
course
,
with
special
interest
.
First
,
I
wished
to
see
*NL*
whether
her
appearance
accorded
with
Mrs.
Fairfax
's
description
;
*NL*
secondly
,
whether
it
at
all
resembled
the
fancy
miniature
I
had
painted
*NL*
of
her
;
and
thirdly
--
it
will
out
!
--
whether
it
were
such
as
I
should
fancy
*NL*
likely
to
suit
Mr.
Rochester
's
taste
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
far
as
person
went
,
she
answered
point
for
point
,
both
to
my
picture
*NL*
and
Mrs.
Fairfax
's
description
.
The
noble
bust
,
the
sloping
shoulders
,
*NL*
the
graceful
neck
,
the
dark
eyes
and
black
ringlets
were
all
there
;
--
but
*NL*
her
face
?
Her
face
was
like
her
mother
's
;
a
youthful
unfurrowed
*NL*
likeness
:
the
same
low
brow
,
the
same
high
features
,
the
same
pride
.
It
*NL*
was
not
,
however
,
so
saturnine
a
pride
!
she
laughed
continually
;
her
*NL*
laugh
was
satirical
,
and
so
was
the
habitual
expression
of
her
arched
and
*NL*
haughty
lip
.
*NL*
*NL*
Genius
is
said
to
be
self-conscious
.
I
can
not
tell
whether
Miss
Ingram
*NL*
was
a
genius
,
but
she
was
self-conscious
--
remarkably
self-conscious
*NL*
indeed
.
She
entered
into
a
discourse
on
botany
with
the
gentle
Mrs.
*NL*
Dent
.
It
seemed
Mrs.
Dent
had
not
studied
that
science
:
though
,
as
she
*NL*
said
,
she
liked
flowers
,
``
especially
wild
ones
;
''
Miss
Ingram
had
,
and
she
*NL*
ran
over
its
vocabulary
with
an
air
.
I
presently
perceived
she
was
-LRB-
what
*NL*
is
vernacularly
termed
-RRB-
_
trailing
_
Mrs.
Dent
;
that
is
,
playing
on
her
*NL*
ignorance
--
her
_
trail
_
might
be
clever
,
but
it
was
decidedly
not
good
-
*NL*
natured
.
She
played
:
her
execution
was
brilliant
;
she
sang
:
her
voice
*NL*
was
fine
;
she
talked
French
apart
to
her
mamma
;
and
she
talked
it
well
,
*NL*
with
fluency
and
with
a
good
accent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
had
a
milder
and
more
open
countenance
than
Blanche
;
softer
features
*NL*
too
,
and
a
skin
some
shades
fairer
-LRB-
Miss
Ingram
was
dark
as
a
*NL*
Spaniard
-RRB-
--
but
Mary
was
deficient
in
life
:
her
face
lacked
expression
,
*NL*
her
eye
lustre
;
she
had
nothing
to
say
,
and
having
once
taken
her
seat
,
*NL*
remained
fixed
like
a
statue
in
its
niche
.
The
sisters
were
both
attired
*NL*
in
spotless
white
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
did
I
now
think
Miss
Ingram
such
a
choice
as
Mr.
Rochester
would
be
*NL*
likely
to
make
?
I
could
not
tell
--
I
did
not
know
his
taste
in
female
*NL*
beauty
.
If
he
liked
the
majestic
,
she
was
the
very
type
of
majesty
:
then
*NL*
she
was
accomplished
,
sprightly
.
Most
gentlemen
would
admire
her
,
I
*NL*
thought
;
and
that
he
_
did
_
admire
her
,
I
already
seemed
to
have
obtained
*NL*
proof
:
to
remove
the
last
shade
of
doubt
,
it
remained
but
to
see
them
*NL*
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
are
not
to
suppose
,
reader
,
that
Adele
has
all
this
time
been
sitting
*NL*
motionless
on
the
stool
at
my
feet
:
no
;
when
the
ladies
entered
,
she
*NL*
rose
,
advanced
to
meet
them
,
made
a
stately
reverence
,
and
said
with
*NL*
gravity
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bon
jour
,
mesdames
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Miss
Ingram
had
looked
down
at
her
with
a
mocking
air
,
and
exclaimed
,
*NL*
``
Oh
,
what
a
little
puppet
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Lynn
had
remarked
,
``
It
is
Mr.
Rochester
's
ward
,
I
suppose
--
the
*NL*
little
French
girl
he
was
speaking
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Dent
had
kindly
taken
her
hand
,
and
given
her
a
kiss
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amy
and
Louisa
Eshton
had
cried
out
simultaneously
--
``
What
a
love
of
a
*NL*
child
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
they
had
called
her
to
a
sofa
,
where
she
now
sat
,
ensconced
*NL*
between
them
,
chattering
alternately
in
French
and
broken
English
;
*NL*
absorbing
not
only
the
young
ladies
'
attention
,
but
that
of
Mrs.
Eshton
*NL*
and
Lady
Lynn
,
and
getting
spoilt
to
her
heart
's
content
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
coffee
is
brought
in
,
and
the
gentlemen
are
summoned
.
I
sit
in
*NL*
the
shade
--
if
any
shade
there
be
in
this
brilliantly-lit
apartment
;
the
*NL*
window-curtain
half
hides
me
.
Again
the
arch
yawns
;
they
come
.
The
*NL*
collective
appearance
of
the
gentlemen
,
like
that
of
the
ladies
,
is
very
*NL*
imposing
:
they
are
all
costumed
in
black
;
most
of
them
are
tall
,
some
*NL*
young
.
Henry
and
Frederick
Lynn
are
very
dashing
sparks
indeed
;
and
*NL*
Colonel
Dent
is
a
fine
soldierly
man
.
Mr.
Eshton
,
the
magistrate
of
the
*NL*
district
,
is
gentleman-like
:
his
hair
is
quite
white
,
his
eyebrows
and
*NL*
whiskers
still
dark
,
which
gives
him
something
of
the
appearance
of
a
*NL*
``
pere
noble
de
theatre
.
''
Lord
Ingram
,
like
his
sisters
,
is
very
tall
;
*NL*
like
them
,
also
,
he
is
handsome
;
but
he
shares
Mary
's
apathetic
and
*NL*
listless
look
:
he
seems
to
have
more
length
of
limb
than
vivacity
of
*NL*
blood
or
vigour
of
brain
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
where
is
Mr.
Rochester
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
comes
in
last
:
I
am
not
looking
at
the
arch
,
yet
I
see
him
enter
.
I
*NL*
try
to
concentrate
my
attention
on
those
netting-needles
,
on
the
meshes
*NL*
of
the
purse
I
am
forming
--
I
wish
to
think
only
of
the
work
I
have
in
my
*NL*
hands
,
to
see
only
the
silver
beads
and
silk
threads
that
lie
in
my
lap
;
*NL*
whereas
,
I
distinctly
behold
his
figure
,
and
I
inevitably
recall
the
*NL*
moment
when
I
last
saw
it
;
just
after
I
had
rendered
him
,
what
he
deemed
,
*NL*
an
essential
service
,
and
he
,
holding
my
hand
,
and
looking
down
on
my
*NL*
face
,
surveyed
me
with
eyes
that
revealed
a
heart
full
and
eager
to
*NL*
overflow
;
in
whose
emotions
I
had
a
part
.
How
near
had
I
approached
him
*NL*
at
that
moment
!
What
had
occurred
since
,
calculated
to
change
his
and
my
*NL*
relative
positions
?
Yet
now
,
how
distant
,
how
far
estranged
we
were
!
So
*NL*
far
estranged
,
that
I
did
not
expect
him
to
come
and
speak
to
me
.
I
did
*NL*
not
wonder
,
when
,
without
looking
at
me
,
he
took
a
seat
at
the
other
side
*NL*
of
the
room
,
and
began
conversing
with
some
of
the
ladies
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
sooner
did
I
see
that
his
attention
was
riveted
on
them
,
and
that
I
*NL*
might
gaze
without
being
observed
,
than
my
eyes
were
drawn
involuntarily
*NL*
to
his
face
;
I
could
not
keep
their
lids
under
control
:
they
would
rise
,
*NL*
and
the
irids
would
fix
on
him
.
I
looked
,
and
had
an
acute
pleasure
in
*NL*
looking
,
--
a
precious
yet
poignant
pleasure
;
pure
gold
,
with
a
steely
*NL*
point
of
agony
:
a
pleasure
like
what
the
thirst-perishing
man
might
feel
*NL*
who
knows
the
well
to
which
he
has
crept
is
poisoned
,
yet
stoops
and
*NL*
drinks
divine
draughts
nevertheless
.
*NL*
*NL*
Most
true
is
it
that
``
beauty
is
in
the
eye
of
the
gazer
.
''
My
master
's
*NL*
colourless
,
olive
face
,
square
,
massive
brow
,
broad
and
jetty
eyebrows
,
*NL*
deep
eyes
,
strong
features
,
firm
,
grim
mouth
,
--
all
energy
,
decision
,
*NL*
will
,
--
were
not
beautiful
,
according
to
rule
;
but
they
were
more
than
*NL*
beautiful
to
me
;
they
were
full
of
an
interest
,
an
influence
that
quite
*NL*
mastered
me
,
--
that
took
my
feelings
from
my
own
power
and
fettered
them
*NL*
in
his
.
I
had
not
intended
to
love
him
;
the
reader
knows
I
had
wrought
*NL*
hard
to
extirpate
from
my
soul
the
germs
of
love
there
detected
;
and
now
,
*NL*
at
the
first
renewed
view
of
him
,
they
spontaneously
arrived
,
green
and
*NL*
strong
!
He
made
me
love
him
without
looking
at
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
compared
him
with
his
guests
.
What
was
the
gallant
grace
of
the
Lynns
,
*NL*
the
languid
elegance
of
Lord
Ingram
,
--
even
the
military
distinction
of
*NL*
Colonel
Dent
,
contrasted
with
his
look
of
native
pith
and
genuine
power
?
*NL*
I
had
no
sympathy
in
their
appearance
,
their
expression
:
yet
I
could
*NL*
imagine
that
most
observers
would
call
them
attractive
,
handsome
,
*NL*
imposing
;
while
they
would
pronounce
Mr.
Rochester
at
once
harsh-featured
*NL*
and
melancholy-looking
.
I
saw
them
smile
,
laugh
--
it
was
nothing
;
the
*NL*
light
of
the
candles
had
as
much
soul
in
it
as
their
smile
;
the
tinkle
of
*NL*
the
bell
as
much
significance
as
their
laugh
.
I
saw
Mr.
Rochester
*NL*
smile
:
--
his
stern
features
softened
;
his
eye
grew
both
brilliant
and
*NL*
gentle
,
its
ray
both
searching
and
sweet
.
He
was
talking
,
at
the
moment
,
*NL*
to
Louisa
and
Amy
Eshton
.
I
wondered
to
see
them
receive
with
calm
that
*NL*
look
which
seemed
to
me
so
penetrating
:
I
expected
their
eyes
to
fall
,
*NL*
their
colour
to
rise
under
it
;
yet
I
was
glad
when
I
found
they
were
in
*NL*
no
sense
moved
.
``
He
is
not
to
them
what
he
is
to
me
,
''
I
thought
:
``
he
is
*NL*
not
of
their
kind
.
I
believe
he
is
of
mine
;
--
I
am
sure
he
is
--
I
feel
*NL*
akin
to
him
--
I
understand
the
language
of
his
countenance
and
movements
:
*NL*
though
rank
and
wealth
sever
us
widely
,
I
have
something
in
my
brain
and
*NL*
heart
,
in
my
blood
and
nerves
,
that
assimilates
me
mentally
to
him
.
Did
*NL*
I
say
,
a
few
days
since
,
that
I
had
nothing
to
do
with
him
but
to
receive
*NL*
my
salary
at
his
hands
?
Did
I
forbid
myself
to
think
of
him
in
any
other
*NL*
light
than
as
a
paymaster
?
Blasphemy
against
nature
!
Every
good
,
true
,
*NL*
vigorous
feeling
I
have
gathers
impulsively
round
him
.
I
know
I
must
*NL*
conceal
my
sentiments
:
I
must
smother
hope
;
I
must
remember
that
he
*NL*
can
not
care
much
for
me
.
For
when
I
say
that
I
am
of
his
kind
,
I
do
not
*NL*
mean
that
I
have
his
force
to
influence
,
and
his
spell
to
attract
;
I
mean
*NL*
only
that
I
have
certain
tastes
and
feelings
in
common
with
him
.
I
must
,
*NL*
then
,
repeat
continually
that
we
are
for
ever
sundered
:
--
and
yet
,
while
I
*NL*
breathe
and
think
,
I
must
love
him
.

*NL*
Coffee
is
handed
.
The
ladies
,
since
the
gentlemen
entered
,
have
become
*NL*
lively
as
larks
;
conversation
waxes
brisk
and
merry
.
Colonel
Dent

Mr.

argue
on
politics
;
their

listen

The

proud

dowagers

Sir

George
--
whom
,
by-the-bye
,
I
have
forgotten
to
describe
,
--
a
very
big
,
and
*NL*
very
fresh-looking
country
gentleman
,
stands
before
their

Mr.
Frederick
Lynn
has
*NL*
taken
a
seat
beside
Mary
Ingram
,
and
is
showing
her
the
engravings
of
a
*NL*
splendid
volume
:
she
looks
,
smiles
now
and
then
,
but
apparently
says
*NL*
little
.
The
tall
and
phlegmatic
Lord
Ingram
leans
with
folded
arms
on
*NL*
the
chair-back
of
the
little
and
lively
Amy
Eshton
;
she
glances
up
at
*NL*
him
,
and
chatters
like
a
wren
:
she
likes
him
better
than
she
does
Mr.
*NL*
Rochester
.
Henry
Lynn
has
taken
possession
of
an
ottoman
at
the
feet
of
*NL*
Louisa
:
Adele
shares
it
with
him
:
he
is
trying
to
talk
French
with
her
,
*NL*
and
Louisa
laughs
at
his
blunders
.
With
whom
will
Blanche
Ingram
pair
?
*NL*
She
is
standing
alone
at
the
table
,
bending
gracefully
over
an
album
.
She
*NL*
seems
waiting
to
be
sought
;
but
she
will
not
wait
too
long
:
she
herself
*NL*
selects
a
mate
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Rochester
,
having
quitted
the
Eshtons
,
stands
on
the
hearth
as
*NL*
solitary
as
she
stands
by
the
table
:
she
confronts
him
,
taking
her
*NL*
station
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
mantelpiece
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Rochester
,
I
thought
you
were
not
fond
of
children
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
am
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
what
induced
you
to
take
charge
of
such
a
little
doll
as
that

*NL*
-LRB-
pointing
to
Adele
-RRB-
.
``
Where
did
you
pick
her
up

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
pick
her
up

she
was
left

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
have
sent
her
to

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
not
afford
it
:

are
so
dear

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
suppose
you
have
a
governess
for

I
saw
a

just
now
--
is
she
gone

Oh

no

there
she
is
still

behind

You
pay

I
should

more
so

both
to
keep
in
addition

*NL*
*NL*
I
feared
--
or
should
I
say
,
hoped
?
--
the
allusion
to
me
would
make
Mr.
*NL*
Rochester
glance
my
way
;
and
I
involuntarily
shrank
farther
into
the
*NL*
shade
:
but
he
never
turned
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
considered
the
subject

''
said
he
indifferently
,
looking
*NL*
straight
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
you
men
never
do
consider
economy
and
common
sense

You
should
hear
*NL*
mama
on
the
chapter
of
governesses
:
Mary
and
I
have
had
,
I
should
think
,
*NL*
a
dozen
at
least
in
our
day
;
half
of
them
detestable

the
rest
*NL*
ridiculous

and
all
incubi

they
not

?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
speak
,
my
own
?

*NL*
*NL*
The
young
lady
thus
claimed
as
the
dowager
's
special
property
,
reiterated
*NL*
her
question
with
an
explanation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dearest
,
do
n't
mention
governesses
;
the

makes
me
nervous

I
*NL*

from
their
incompetency

caprice

I
thank

Heaven

now
done
with

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Dent
here
bent
over
to
the
pious
lady
and
whispered
something
in
her
*NL*
ear
;
I
suppose
,
from
the
answer
elicited
,
it
was
a
reminder
that
one
of
*NL*
the
anathematised
race
was
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tant
pis
!
''
said
her
Ladyship
,
``
I
hope
it
may
do
her
good
!
''
Then
,
in
a
*NL*
lower
tone
,
but
still
loud
enough
for
me
to
hear
,
``
I
noticed
her
;
I
am
a
*NL*
judge
of
physiognomy

in

I
see
all

faults
of
her
class

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are

inquired
Mr.
Rochester
aloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
tell
you
in
your
private

replied
she
,
wagging
her
turban
*NL*
three
times
with
portentous
significancy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
my
curiosity
will
be
past

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

him

I
have
just
one
word
to
say
of
the
*NL*
whole
tribe
;
they
are
a
nuisance
.
Not
that
I
ever
suffered
much
from
*NL*
them
;
I
took
care
to
turn
the
tables

What
tricks
Theodore
and
I
used
to
*NL*
play
on
our
Miss
Wilsons
,
and
Mrs.
Greys
,
and
Madame
Jouberts
!
Mary
was
*NL*
always
too
sleepy
to
join
in
a
plot
with
spirit
.
The
best
fun
was
with
*NL*
Madame
Joubert
:
Miss
Wilson
was
a
poor
sickly
thing
,
lachrymose
and
low
-
*NL*
spirited
,
not
worth
the
trouble
of
vanquishing
,
in
short
;
and
Mrs.
Grey
*NL*
was
coarse
and
insensible
;
no
blow
took
effect
on
her
.
But
poor
Madame
*NL*
Joubert
!
I
see
her
yet
in
her
raging
passions
,
when
we
had
driven
her
to
*NL*
extremities
--
spilt
our
tea
,
crumbled
our
bread
and
butter
,
tossed
our
*NL*
books
up
to
the
ceiling
,
and
played
a
charivari
with
the
ruler
and
desk
,
*NL*
the
fender
and
fire-irons

you
remember

*NL*
``
Yaas

drawled
Lord
Ingram
;
``
and
the
poor
old
stick
*NL*
used
to
cry
out

and
then
we
sermonised
her
on
*NL*
the
presumption
of
attempting

teach
such
clever
blades

were

He

the

Tedo

I

fine

he
did

a

into

threw
his

his

finding
a
way
through

there
waking

strangely

*NL*
the
side-door
,
which
was
fortunately
near
.
Thence
a
narrow
passage
led
*NL*
into
the
hall
:
in
crossing
it
,
I
perceived
my
sandal
was
loose
;
I
stopped
*NL*
to
tie
it
,
kneeling
down
for
that
purpose
on
the
mat
at
the
foot
of
the
*NL*
staircase
.
I
heard
the
dining-room
door
unclose
;
a
gentleman
came
out
;
*NL*
rising
hastily
,
I
stood
face
to
face
with
him
:
it
was
Mr.
Rochester
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
do
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
well
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
you
not
come
and
speak
to
me
in
the
room
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
I
might
have
retorted
the
question
on
him
who
put
it
:
but
I
*NL*
would
not
take
that
freedom
.
I
answered
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
wish
to
disturb
you
,
as
you
seemed
engaged
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
you
been
doing
during
my
absence
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
particular
;
teaching
Adele
as
usual
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
getting
a
good
deal
paler
than
you
were
--
as
I
saw
at
first
sight
.
*NL*
What
is
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
at
all
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
take
any
cold
that
night
you
half
drowned
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
the
least
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Return
to
the
drawing-room
:
you
are
deserting
too
early
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
tired
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
me
for
a
minute
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
a
little
depressed
,
''
he
said
.
``
What
about
?
Tell
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
--
nothing
,
sir
.
I
am
not
depressed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
affirm
that
you
are
:
so
much
depressed
that
a
few
more
words
would
*NL*
bring
tears
to
your
eyes
--
indeed
,
they
are
there
now
,
shining
and
*NL*
swimming
;
and
a
bead
has
slipped
from
the
lash
and
fallen
on
to
the
flag
.
*NL*
If
I
had
time
,
and
was
not
in
mortal
dread
of
some
prating
prig
of
a
*NL*
servant
passing
,
I
would
know
what
all
this
means
.
Well
,
to-night
I
*NL*
excuse
you
;
but
understand
that
so
long
as
my
visitors
stay
,
I
expect
you
*NL*
to
appear
in
the
drawing-room
every
evening
;
it
is
my
wish
;
do
n't
neglect
*NL*
it
.
Now
go
,
and
send
Sophie
for
Adele
.
Good-night
,
my

He
stopped
,
*NL*
bit
his
lip
,
and
abruptly
left
me
.

CHAPTER
XVIII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Merry
days
were
these
at
Thornfield
Hall
;
and
busy
days
too
:
how
*NL*
different
from
the
first
three
months
of
stillness
,
monotony
,
and
*NL*
solitude
I
had
passed
beneath
its
roof
!
All
sad
feelings
seemed
now
*NL*
driven
from
the
house
,
all
gloomy
associations
forgotten
:
there
was
life
*NL*
everywhere
,
movement
all
day
long
.
You
could
not
now
traverse
the
*NL*
gallery
,
once
so
hushed
,
nor
enter
the
front
chambers
,
once
so
*NL*
tenantless
,
without
encountering
a
smart
lady
's
-
maid
or
a
dandy
valet
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
kitchen
,
the
butler
's
pantry
,
the
servants
'
hall
,
the
entrance
hall
,
*NL*
were
equally
alive
;
and
the
saloons
were
only
left
void
and
still
when
*NL*
the
blue
sky
and
halcyon
sunshine
of
the
genial
spring
weather
called
*NL*
their
occupants
out
into
the
grounds
.
Even
when
that
weather
was
broken
,
*NL*
and
continuous
rain
set
in
for
some
days
,
no
damp
seemed
cast
over
*NL*
enjoyment
:
indoor
amusements
only
became
more
lively
and
varied
,
in
*NL*
consequence
of
the
stop
put
to
outdoor
gaiety
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
wondered
what
they
were
going
to
do
the
first
evening
a
change
of
*NL*
entertainment
was
proposed
:
they
spoke
of
``
playing
charades
,
''
but
in
my
*NL*
ignorance
I
did
not
understand
the
term
.
The
servants
were
called
in
,
*NL*
the
dining-room
tables
wheeled
away
,
the
lights
otherwise
disposed
,
the
*NL*
chairs
placed
in
a
semicircle
opposite
the
arch
.
While
Mr.
Rochester
and
*NL*
the
other
gentlemen
directed
these
alterations
,
the
ladies
were
running
*NL*
up
and
down
stairs
ringing
for
their
maids
.
Mrs.
Fairfax
was
summoned
to
*NL*
give
information
respecting
the
resources
of
the
house
in
shawls
,
*NL*
dresses
,
draperies
of
any
kind
;
and
certain
wardrobes
of
the
third
storey
*NL*
were
ransacked
,
and
their
contents
,
in
the
shape
of
brocaded
and
hooped
*NL*
petticoats
,
satin
sacques
,
black
modes
,
lace
lappets
,
&
c.
,
were
brought
*NL*
down
in
armfuls
by
the
abigails
;
then
a
selection
was
made
,
and
such
*NL*
things
as
were
chosen
were
carried
to
the
boudoir
within
the
*NL*
drawing-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meantime
,
Mr.
Rochester
had
again
summoned
the
ladies
round
him
,
and
was
*NL*
selecting
certain
of
their
number
to
be
of
his
party
.
``
Miss
Ingram
is
*NL*
mine
,
of
course
,
''
said
he
:
afterwards
he
named
the
two
Misses
Eshton
,
and
*NL*
Mrs.
Dent
.
He
looked
at
me
:
I
happened
to
be
near
him
,
as
I
had
been
*NL*
fastening
the
clasp
of
Mrs.
Dent
's
bracelet
,
which
had
got
loose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
play
?
''
he
asked
.
I
shook
my
head
.
He
did
not
insist
,
which
I
*NL*
rather
feared
he
would
have
done
;
he
allowed
me
to
return
quietly
to
my
*NL*
usual
seat
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
and
his
aids
now
withdrew
behind
the
curtain
:
the
other
party
,
which
*NL*
was
headed
by
Colonel
Dent
,
sat
down
on
the
crescent
of
chairs
.
One
of
*NL*
the
gentlemen
,
Mr.
Eshton
,
observing
me
,
seemed
to
propose
that
I
should
*NL*
be
asked
to
join
them
;
but
Lady
Ingram
instantly
negatived
the
notion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
I
heard
her
say
:
``
she
looks
too
stupid
for
any
game
of
the
sort
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ere
long
a
bell
tinkled
,
and
the
curtain
drew
up
.
Within
the
arch
,
the
*NL*
bulky
figure
of
Sir
George
Lynn
,
whom
Mr.
Rochester
had
likewise
chosen
,
*NL*
was
seen
enveloped
in
a
white
sheet
:
before
him
,
on
a
table
,
lay
open
a
*NL*
large
book
;
and
at
his
side
stood
Amy
Eshton
,
draped
in
Mr.
Rochester
's
*NL*
cloak
,
and
holding
a
book
in
her
hand
.
Somebody
,
unseen
,
rang
the
bell
*NL*
merrily
;
then
Adele
-LRB-
who
had
insisted
on
being
one
of
her
guardian
's
*NL*
party
-RRB-
,
bounded
forward
,
scattering
round
her
the
contents
of
a
basket
of
*NL*
flowers
she
carried
on
her
arm
.
Then
appeared
the
magnificent
figure
of
*NL*
Miss
Ingram
,
clad
in
white
,
a
long
veil
on
her
head
,
and
a
wreath
of
*NL*
roses
round
her
brow
;
by
her
side
walked
Mr.
Rochester
,
and
together
they
*NL*
drew
near
the
table
.
They
knelt
;
while
Mrs.
Dent
and
Louisa
Eshton
,
*NL*
dressed
also
in
white
,
took
up
their
stations
behind
them
.
A
ceremony
*NL*
followed
,
in
dumb
show
,
in
which
it
was
easy
to
recognise
the
pantomime
*NL*
of
a
marriage
.
At
its
termination
,
Colonel
Dent
and
his
party
consulted
*NL*
in
whispers
for
two
minutes
,
then
the
Colonel
called
out
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bride
!
''
Mr.
Rochester
bowed
,
and
the
curtain
fell
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
considerable
interval
elapsed
before
it
again
rose
.
Its
second
rising
*NL*
displayed
a
more
elaborately
prepared
scene
than
the
last
.
The
drawing
-
*NL*
room
,
as
I
have
before
observed
,
was
raised
two
steps
above
the
dining
-
*NL*
room
,
and
on
the
top
of
the
upper
step
,
placed
a
yard
or
two
back
within
*NL*
the
room
,
appeared
a
large
marble
basin
--
which
I
recognised
as
an
*NL*
ornament
of
the
conservatory
--
where
it
usually
stood
,
surrounded
by
*NL*
exotics
,
and
tenanted
by
gold
fish
--
and
whence
it
must
have
been
*NL*
transported
with
some
trouble
,
on
account
of
its
size
and
weight
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seated
on
the
carpet
,
by
the
side
of
this
basin
,
was
seen
Mr.
Rochester
,
*NL*
costumed
in
shawls
,
with
a
turban
on
his
head
.
His
dark
eyes
and
swarthy
*NL*
skin
and
Paynim
features
suited
the
costume
exactly
:
he
looked
the
very
*NL*
model
of
an
Eastern
emir
,
an
agent
or
a
victim
of
the
bowstring
.
*NL*
Presently
advanced
into
view
Miss
Ingram
.
She
,
too
,
was
attired
in
*NL*
oriental
fashion
:
a
crimson
scarf
tied
sash-like
round
the
waist
:
an
*NL*
embroidered
handkerchief
knotted
about
her
temples
;
her
*NL*
beautifully-moulded
arms
bare
,
one
of
them
upraised
in
the
act
of
*NL*
supporting
a
pitcher
,
poised
gracefully
on
her
head
.
Both
her
cast
of
*NL*
form
and
feature
,
her
complexion
and
her
general
air
,
suggested
the
idea
*NL*
of
some
Israelitish
princess
of
the
patriarchal
days
;
and
such
was
*NL*
doubtless
the
character
she
intended
to
represent
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
approached
the
basin
,
and
bent
over
it
as
if
to
fill
her
pitcher
;
she
*NL*
again
lifted
it
to
her
head
.
The
personage
on
the
well-brink
now
seemed
*NL*
to
accost
her
;
to
make
some
request
:
--
``
She
hasted
,
let
down
her
pitcher
*NL*
on
her
hand
,
and
gave
him
to
drink
.
''
From
the
bosom
of
his
robe
he
then
*NL*
produced
a
casket
,
opened
it
and
showed
magnificent
bracelets
and
*NL*
earrings
;
she
acted
astonishment
and
admiration
;
kneeling
,
he
laid
the
*NL*
treasure
at
her
feet
;
incredulity
and
delight
were
expressed
by
her
looks
*NL*
and
gestures
;
the
stranger
fastened
the
bracelets
on
her
arms
and
the
*NL*
rings
in
her
ears
.
It
was
Eliezer
and
Rebecca
:
the
camels
only
were
*NL*
wanting
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
divining
party
again
laid
their
heads
together
:
apparently
they
could
*NL*
not
agree
about
the
word
or
syllable
the
scene
illustrated
.
Colonel
*NL*
Dent
,
their
spokesman
,
demanded
``
the
tableau
of
the
whole
;
''
whereupon
the
*NL*
curtain
again
descended
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
its
third
rising
only
a
portion
of
the
drawing-room
was
disclosed
;
the
*NL*
rest
being
concealed
by
a
screen
,
hung
with
some
sort
of
dark
and
coarse
*NL*
drapery
.
The
marble
basin
was
removed
;
in
its
place
,
stood
a
deal
table
*NL*
and
a
kitchen
chair
:
these
objects
were
visible
by
a
very
dim
light
*NL*
proceeding
from
a
horn
lantern
,
the
wax
candles
being
all
extinguished
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amidst
this
sordid
scene
,
sat
a
man
with
his
clenched
hands
resting
on
*NL*
his
knees
,
and
his
eyes
bent
on
the
ground
.
I
knew
Mr.
Rochester
;
though
*NL*
the
begrimed
face
,
the
disordered
dress
-LRB-
his
coat
hanging
loose
from
one
*NL*
arm
,
as
if
it
had
been
almost
torn
from
his
back
in
a
scuffle
-RRB-
,
the
*NL*
desperate
and
scowling
countenance
,
the
rough
,
bristling
hair
might
well
*NL*
have
disguised
him
.
As
he
moved
,
a
chain
clanked
;
to
his
wrists
were
*NL*
attached
fetters
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bridewell
!
''
exclaimed
Colonel
Dent
,
and
the
charade
was
solved
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
sufficient
interval
having
elapsed
for
the
performers
to
resume
their
*NL*
ordinary
costume
,
they
re-entered
the
dining-room
.
Mr.
Rochester
led
in
*NL*
Miss
Ingram
;
she
was
complimenting
him
on
his
acting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
''
said
she
,
``
that
,
of
the
three
characters
,
I
liked
you
in
*NL*
the
last
best
?
Oh
,
had
you
but
lived
a
few
years
earlier
,
what
a
gallant
*NL*
gentleman-highwayman
you
would
have
made
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
all
the
soot
washed
from
my
face
?
''
he
asked
,
turning
it
towards
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
!
yes
:
the
more
's
the
pity
!
Nothing
could
be
more
becoming
to
your
*NL*
complexion
than
that
ruffian
's
rouge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
like
a
hero
of
the
road
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
English
hero
of
the
road
would
be
the
next
best
thing
to
an
Italian
*NL*
bandit
;
and
that
could
only
be
surpassed
by
a
Levantine
pirate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
whatever
I
am
,
remember
you
are
my
wife
;
we
were
married
an
hour
*NL*
since
,
in
the
presence
of
all
these
witnesses
.
''
She
giggled
,
and
her
*NL*
colour
rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Dent
,
''
continued
Mr.
Rochester
,
``
it
is
your
turn
.
''
And
as
the
*NL*
other
party
withdrew
,
he
and
his
band
took
the
vacated
seats
.
Miss
*NL*
Ingram
placed
herself
at
her
leader
's
right
hand
;
the
other
diviners
*NL*
filled
the
chairs
on
each
side
of
him
and
her
.
I
did
not
now
watch
the
*NL*
actors
;
I
no
longer
waited
with
interest
for
the
curtain
to
rise
;
my
*NL*
attention
was
absorbed
by
the
spectators
;
my
eyes
,
erewhile
fixed
on
the
*NL*
arch
,
were
now
irresistibly
attracted
to
the
semicircle
of
chairs
.
What
*NL*
charade
Colonel
Dent
and
his
party
played
,
what
word
they
chose
,
how
they
*NL*
acquitted
themselves
,
I
no
longer
remember
;
but
I
still
see
the
*NL*
consultation
which
followed
each
scene
:
I
see
Mr.
Rochester
turn
to
Miss
*NL*
Ingram
,
and
Miss
Ingram
to
him
;
I
see
her
incline
her
head
towards
him
,
*NL*
till
the
jetty
curls
almost
touch
his
shoulder
and
wave
against
his
*NL*
cheek
;
I
hear
their
mutual
whisperings
;
I
recall
their
interchanged
*NL*
glances
;
and
something
even
of
the
feeling
roused
by
the
spectacle
*NL*
returns
in
memory
at
this
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
told
you
,
reader
,
that
I
had
learnt
to
love
Mr.
Rochester
:
I
could
*NL*
not
unlove
him
now
,
merely
because
I
found
that
he
had
ceased
to
notice
*NL*
me
--
because
I
might
pass
hours
in
his
presence
,
and
he
would
never
once
*NL*
turn
his
eyes
in
my
direction
--
because
I
saw
all
his
attentions
*NL*
appropriated
by
a
great
lady
,
who
scorned
to
touch
me
with
the
hem
of
her
*NL*
robes
as
she
passed
;
who
,
if
ever
her
dark
and
imperious
eye
fell
on
me
*NL*
by
chance
,
would
withdraw
it
instantly
as
from
an
object
too
mean
to
*NL*
merit
observation
.
I
could
not
unlove
him
,
because
I
felt
sure
he
would
*NL*
soon
marry
this
very
lady
--
because
I
read
daily
in
her
a
proud
security
*NL*
in
his
intentions
respecting
her
--
because
I
witnessed
hourly
in
him
a
*NL*
style
of
courtship
which
,
if
careless
and
choosing
rather
to
be
sought
*NL*
than
to
seek
,
was
yet
,
in
its
very
carelessness
,
captivating
,
and
in
its
*NL*
very
pride
,
irresistible
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
nothing
to
cool
or
banish
love
in
these
circumstances
,
though
*NL*
much
to
create
despair
.
Much
too
,
you
will
think
,
reader
,
to
engender
*NL*
jealousy
:
if
a
woman
,
in
my
position
,
could
presume
to
be
jealous
of
a
*NL*
woman
in
Miss
Ingram
's
.
But
I
was
not
jealous
:
or
very
rarely
;
--
the
*NL*
nature
of
the
pain
I
suffered
could
not
be
explained
by
that
word
.
Miss
*NL*
Ingram
was
a
mark
beneath
jealousy
:
she
was
too
inferior
to
excite
the
*NL*
feeling
.
Pardon
the
seeming
paradox
;
I
mean
what
I
say
.
She
was
very
*NL*
showy
,
but
she
was
not
genuine
:
she
had
a
fine
person
,
many
brilliant
*NL*
attainments
;
but
her
mind
was
poor
,
her
heart
barren
by
nature
:
nothing
*NL*
bloomed
spontaneously
on
that
soil
;
no
unforced
natural
fruit
delighted
*NL*
by
its
freshness
.
She
was
not
good
;
she
was
not
original
:
she
used
to
*NL*
repeat
sounding
phrases
from
books
:
she
never
offered
,
nor
had
,
an
*NL*
opinion
of
her
own
.
She
advocated
a
high
tone
of
sentiment
;
but
she
did
*NL*
not
know
the
sensations
of
sympathy
and
pity
;
tenderness
and
truth
were
*NL*
not
in
her
.
Too
often
she
betrayed
this
,
by
the
undue
vent
she
gave
to
a
*NL*
spiteful
antipathy
she
had
conceived
against
little
Adele
:
pushing
her
*NL*
away
with
some
contumelious
epithet
if
she
happened
to
approach
her
;
*NL*
sometimes
ordering
her
from
the
room
,
and
always
treating
her
with
*NL*
coldness
and
acrimony
.
Other
eyes
besides
mine
watched
these
*NL*
manifestations
of
character
--
watched
them
closely
,
keenly
,
shrewdly
.
Yes
;
*NL*
the
future
bridegroom
,
Mr.
Rochester
himself
,
exercised
over
his
intended
*NL*
a
ceaseless
surveillance
;
and
it
was
from
this
sagacity
--
this
guardedness
*NL*
of
his
--
this
perfect
,
clear
consciousness
of
his
fair
one
's
defects
--
this
*NL*
obvious
absence
of
passion
in
his
sentiments
towards
her
,
that
my
ever
-
*NL*
torturing
pain
arose
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
saw
he
was
going
to
marry
her
,
for
family
,
perhaps
political
reasons
,
*NL*
because
her
rank
and
connections
suited
him
;
I
felt
he
had
not
given
her
*NL*
his
love
,
and
that
her
qualifications
were
ill
adapted
to
win
from
him
*NL*
that
treasure
.
This
was
the
point
--
this
was
where
the
nerve
was
touched
*NL*
and
teased
--
this
was
where
the
fever
was
sustained
and
fed
:
_
she
could
*NL*
not
charm
him
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
she
had
managed
the
victory
at
once
,
and
he
had
yielded
and
sincerely
*NL*
laid
his
heart
at
her
feet
,
I
should
have
covered
my
face
,
turned
to
the
*NL*
wall
,
and
-LRB-
figuratively
-RRB-
have
died
to
them
.
If
Miss
Ingram
had
been
a
*NL*
good
and
noble
woman
,
endowed
with
force
,
fervour
,
kindness
,
sense
,
I
*NL*
should
have
had
one
vital
struggle
with
two
tigers
--
jealousy
and
despair
:
*NL*
then
,
my
heart
torn
out
and
devoured
,
I
should
have
admired
*NL*
her
--
acknowledged
her
excellence
,
and
been
quiet
for
the
rest
of
my
days
:
*NL*
and
the
more
absolute
her
superiority
,
the
deeper
would
have
been
my
*NL*
admiration
--
the
more
truly
tranquil
my
quiescence
.
But
as
matters
really
*NL*
stood
,
to
watch
Miss
Ingram
's
efforts
at
fascinating
Mr.
Rochester
,
to
*NL*
witness
their
repeated
failure
--
herself
unconscious
that
they
did
fail
;
*NL*
vainly
fancying
that
each
shaft
launched
hit
the
mark
,
and
infatuatedly
*NL*
pluming
herself
on
success
,
when
her
pride
and
self-complacency
repelled
*NL*
further
and
further
what
she
wished
to
allure
--
to
witness
_
this
_
,
was
to
*NL*
be
at
once
under
ceaseless
excitation
and
ruthless
restraint
.
*NL*
*NL*
Because
,
when
she
failed
,
I
saw
how
she
might
have
succeeded
.
Arrows
*NL*
that
continually
glanced
off
from
Mr.
Rochester
's
breast
and
fell
*NL*
harmless
at
his
feet
,
might
,
I
knew
,
if
shot
by
a
surer
hand
,
have
*NL*
quivered
keen
in
his
proud
heart
--
have
called
love
into
his
stern
eye
,
*NL*
and
softness
into
his
sardonic
face
;
or
,
better
still
,
without
weapons
a
*NL*
silent
conquest
might
have
been
won
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
can
she
not
influence
him
more
,
when
she
is
privileged
to
draw
so
*NL*
near
to
him
?
''
I
asked
myself
.
``
Surely
she
can
not
truly
like
him
,
or
not
*NL*
like
him
with
true
affection
!
If
she
did
,
she
need
not
coin
her
smiles
*NL*
so
lavishly
,
flash
her
glances
so
unremittingly
,
manufacture
airs
so
*NL*
elaborate
,
graces
so
multitudinous
.
It
seems
to
me
that
she
might
,
by
*NL*
merely
sitting
quietly
at
his
side
,
saying
little
and
looking
less
,
get
*NL*
nigher
his
heart
.
I
have
seen
in
his
face
a
far
different
expression
*NL*
from
that
which
hardens
it
now
while
she
is
so
vivaciously
accosting
him
;
*NL*
but
then
it
came
of
itself
:
it
was
not
elicited
by
meretricious
arts
and
*NL*
calculated
manoeuvres
;
and
one
had
but
to
accept
it
--
to
answer
what
he
*NL*
asked
without
pretension
,
to
address
him
when
needful
without
grimace
--
and
*NL*
it
increased
and
grew
kinder
and
more
genial
,
and
warmed
one
like
a
*NL*
fostering
sunbeam
.
How
will
she
manage
to
please
him
when
they
are
*NL*
married
?
I
do
not
think
she
will
manage
it
;
and
yet
it
might
be
managed
;
*NL*
and
his
wife
might
,
I
verily
believe
,
be
the
very
happiest
woman
the
sun
*NL*
shines
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
not
yet
said
anything
condemnatory
of
Mr.
Rochester
's
project
of
*NL*
marrying
for
interest
and
connections
.
It
surprised
me
when
I
first
*NL*
discovered
that
such
was
his
intention
:
I
had
thought
him
a
man
unlikely
*NL*
to
be
influenced
by
motives
so
commonplace
in
his
choice
of
a
wife
;
but
*NL*
the
longer
I
considered
the
position
,
education
,
&
c.
,
of
the
parties
,
the
*NL*
less
I
felt
justified
in
judging
and
blaming
either
him
or
Miss
Ingram
*NL*
for
acting
in
conformity
to
ideas
and
principles
instilled
into
them
,
*NL*
doubtless
,
from
their
childhood
.
All
their
class
held
these
principles
:
*NL*
I
supposed
,
then
,
they
had
reasons
for
holding
them
such
as
I
could
not
*NL*
fathom
.
It
seemed
to
me
that
,
were
I
a
gentleman
like
him
,
I
would
take
*NL*
to
my
bosom
only
such
a
wife
as
I
could
love
;
but
the
very
obviousness
of
*NL*
the
advantages
to
the
husband
's
own
happiness
offered
by
this
plan
*NL*
convinced
me
that
there
must
be
arguments
against
its
general
adoption
of
*NL*
which
I
was
quite
ignorant
:
otherwise
I
felt
sure
all
the
world
would
act
*NL*
as
I
wished
to
act
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
in
other
points
,
as
well
as
this
,
I
was
growing
very
lenient
to
my
*NL*
master
:
I
was
forgetting
all
his
faults
,
for
which
I
had
once
kept
a
*NL*
sharp
look-out
.
It
had
formerly
been
my
endeavour
to
study
all
sides
of
*NL*
his
character
:
to
take
the
bad
with
the
good
;
and
from
the
just
weighing
*NL*
of
both
,
to
form
an
equitable
judgment
.
Now
I
saw
no
bad
.
The
sarcasm
*NL*
that
had
repelled
,
the
harshness
that
had
startled
me
once
,
were
only
*NL*
like
keen
condiments
in
a
choice
dish
:
their
presence
was
pungent
,
but
*NL*
their
absence
would
be
felt
as
comparatively
insipid
.
And
as
for
the
*NL*
vague
something
--
was
it
a
sinister
or
a
sorrowful
,
a
designing
or
a
*NL*
desponding
expression
?
--
that
opened
upon
a
careful
observer
,
now
and
*NL*
then
,
in
his
eye
,
and
closed
again
before
one
could
fathom
the
strange
*NL*
depth
partially
disclosed
;
that
something
which
used
to
make
me
fear
and
*NL*
shrink
,
as
if
I
had
been
wandering
amongst
volcanic-looking
hills
,
and
*NL*
had
suddenly
felt
the
ground
quiver
and
seen
it
gape
:
that
something
,
I
,
*NL*
at
intervals
,
beheld
still
;
and
with
throbbing
heart
,
but
not
with
*NL*
palsied
nerves
.
Instead
of
wishing
to
shun
,
I
longed
only
to
dare
--
to
*NL*
divine
it
;
and
I
thought
Miss
Ingram
happy
,
because
one
day
she
might
*NL*
look
into
the
abyss
at
her
leisure
,
explore
its
secrets
and
analyse
their
*NL*
nature
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meantime
,
while
I
thought
only
of
my
master
and
his
future
bride
--
saw
*NL*
only
them
,
heard
only
their
discourse
,
and
considered
only
their
*NL*
movements
of
importance
--
the
rest
of
the
party
were
occupied
with
their
*NL*
own
separate
interests
and
pleasures
.
The
Ladies
Lynn
and
Ingram
*NL*
continued
to
consort
in
solemn
conferences
,
where
they
nodded
their
two
*NL*
turbans
at
each
other
,
and
held
up
their
four
hands
in
confronting
*NL*
gestures
of
surprise
,
or
mystery
,
or
horror
,
according
to
the
theme
on
*NL*
which
their
gossip
ran
,
like
a
pair
of
magnified
puppets
.
Mild
Mrs.
Dent
*NL*
talked
with
good-natured
Mrs.
Eshton
;
and
the
two
sometimes
bestowed
a
*NL*
courteous
word
or
smile
on
me
.
Sir
George
Lynn
,
Colonel
Dent
,
and
Mr.
*NL*
Eshton
discussed
politics
,
or
county
affairs
,
or
justice
business
.
Lord
*NL*
Ingram
flirted
with
Amy
Eshton
;
Louisa
played
and
sang
to
and
with
one
of
*NL*
the
Messrs.
Lynn
;
and
Mary
Ingram
listened
languidly
to
the
gallant
*NL*
speeches
of
the
other
.
Sometimes
all
,
as
with
one
consent
,
suspended
*NL*
their
by-play
to
observe
and
listen
to
the
principal
actors
:
for
,
after
*NL*
all
,
Mr.
Rochester
and
--
because
closely
connected
with
him
--
Miss
Ingram
*NL*
were
the
life
and
soul
of
the
party
.
If
he
was
absent
from
the
room
an
*NL*
hour
,
a
perceptible
dulness
seemed
to
steal
over
the
spirits
of
his
*NL*
guests
;
and
his
re-entrance
was
sure
to
give
a
fresh
impulse
to
the
*NL*
vivacity
of
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
want
of
his
animating
influence
appeared
to
be
peculiarly
felt
one
*NL*
day
that
he
had
been
summoned
to
Millcote
on
business
,
and
was
not
likely
*NL*
to
return
till
late
.
The
afternoon
was
wet
:
a
walk
the
party
had
*NL*
proposed
to
take
to
see
a
gipsy
camp
,
lately
pitched
on
a
common
beyond
*NL*
Hay
,
was
consequently
deferred
.
Some
of
the
gentlemen
were
gone
to
the
*NL*
stables
:
the
younger
ones
,
together
with
the
younger
ladies
,
were
playing
*NL*
billiards
in
the
billiard-room
.
The
dowagers
Ingram
and
Lynn
sought
*NL*
solace
in
a
quiet
game
at
cards
.
Blanche
Ingram
,
after
having
repelled
,
*NL*
by
supercilious
taciturnity
,
some
efforts
of
Mrs.
Dent
and
Mrs.
Eshton
to
*NL*
draw
her
into
conversation
,
had
first
murmured
over
some
sentimental
*NL*
tunes
and
airs
on
the
piano
,
and
then
,
having
fetched
a
novel
from
the
*NL*
library
,
had
flung
herself
in
haughty
listlessness
on
a
sofa
,
and
*NL*
prepared
to
beguile
,
by
the
spell
of
fiction
,
the
tedious
hours
of
*NL*
absence
.
The
room
and
the
house
were
silent
:
only
now
and
then
the
*NL*
merriment
of
the
billiard-players
was
heard
from
above
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
verging
on
dusk
,
and
the
clock
had
already
given
warning
of
the
*NL*
hour
to
dress
for
dinner
,
when
little
Adele
,
who
knelt
by
me
in
the
*NL*
drawing-room
window-seat
,
suddenly
exclaimed
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Voila
,
Monsieur
Rochester
,
qui
revient
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
turned
,
and
Miss
Ingram
darted
forwards
from
her
sofa
:
the
others
,
too
,
*NL*
looked
up
from
their
several
occupations
;
for
at
the
same
time
a
*NL*
crunching
of
wheels
and
a
splashing
tramp
of
horse-hoofs
became
audible
*NL*
on
the
wet
gravel
.
A
post-chaise
was
approaching
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
possess
him
to
come
home
in
that
style
?
''
said
Miss
Ingram
.
``
He
*NL*
rode
Mesrour
-LRB-
the
black
horse
-RRB-
,
did
he
not
,
when
he
went
out
?
and
Pilot
*NL*
was
with
him
:
--
what
has
he
done
with
the
animals
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
said
this
,
she
approached
her
tall
person
and
ample
garments
so
*NL*
near
the
window
,
that
I
was
obliged
to
bend
back
almost
to
the
breaking
*NL*
of
my
spine
:
in
her
eagerness
she
did
not
observe
me
at
first
,
but
when
*NL*
she
did
,
she
curled
her
lip
and
moved
to
another
casement
.
The
*NL*
post-chaise
stopped
;
the
driver
rang
the
door-bell
,
and
a
gentleman
*NL*
alighted
attired
in
travelling
garb
;
but
it
was
not
Mr.
Rochester
;
it
was
*NL*
a
tall
,
fashionable-looking
man
,
a
stranger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
provoking
!
''
exclaimed
Miss
Ingram
:
``
you
tiresome
monkey
!
''
*NL*
-LRB-
apostrophising
Adele
-RRB-
,
``
who
perched
you
up
in
the
window
to
give
false
*NL*
intelligence
?
''
and
she
cast
on
me
an
angry
glance
,
as
if
I
were
in
fault
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
parleying
was
audible
in
the
hall
,
and
soon
the
new-comer
entered
.
*NL*
He
bowed
to
Lady
Ingram
,
as
deeming
her
the
eldest
lady
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
appears
I
come
at
an
inopportune
time
,
madam
,
''
said
he
,
``
when
my
*NL*
friend
,
Mr.
Rochester
,
is
from
home
;
but
I
arrive
from
a
very
long
*NL*
journey
,
and
I
think
I
may
presume
so
far
on
old
and
intimate
*NL*
acquaintance
as
to
instal
myself
here
till
he
returns
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
manner
was
polite
;
his
accent
,
in
speaking
,
struck
me
as
being
*NL*
somewhat
unusual
,
--
not
precisely
foreign
,
but
still
not
altogether
*NL*
English
:
his
age
might
be
about
Mr.
Rochester
's
,
--
between
thirty
and
*NL*
forty
;
his
complexion
was
singularly
sallow
:
otherwise
he
was
a
*NL*
fine-looking
man
,
at
first
sight
especially
.
On
closer
examination
,
you
*NL*
detected
something
in
his
face
that
displeased
,
or
rather
that
failed
to
*NL*
please
.
His
features
were
regular
,
but
too
relaxed
:
his
eye
was
large
*NL*
and
well
cut
,
but
the
life
looking
out
of
it
was
a
tame
,
vacant
life
--
at
*NL*
least
so
I
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sound
of
the
dressing-bell
dispersed
the
party
.
It
was
not
till
*NL*
after
dinner
that
I
saw
him
again
:
he
then
seemed
quite
at
his
ease
.
But
*NL*
I
liked
his
physiognomy
even
less
than
before
:
it
struck
me
as
being
at
*NL*
the
same
time
unsettled
and
inanimate
.
His
eye
wandered
,
and
had
no
*NL*
meaning
in
its
wandering
:
this
gave
him
an
odd
look
,
such
as
I
never
*NL*
remembered
to
have
seen
.
For
a
handsome
and
not
an
unamiable-looking
*NL*
man
,
he
repelled
me
exceedingly
:
there
was
no
power
in
that
*NL*
smooth-skinned
face
of
a
full
oval
shape
:
no
firmness
in
that
aquiline
*NL*
nose
and
small
cherry
mouth
;
there
was
no
thought
on
the
low
,
even
*NL*
forehead
;
no
command
in
that
blank
,
brown
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
sat
in
my
usual
nook
,
and
looked
at
him
with
the
light
of
the
*NL*
girandoles
on
the
mantelpiece
beaming
full
over
him
--
for
he
occupied
an
*NL*
arm-chair
drawn
close
to
the
fire
,
and
kept
shrinking
still
nearer
,
as
if
*NL*
he
were
cold
,
I
compared
him
with
Mr.
Rochester
.
I
think
-LRB-
with
deference
*NL*
be
it
spoken
-RRB-
the
contrast
could
not
be
much
greater
between
a
sleek
*NL*
gander
and
a
fierce
falcon
:
between
a
meek
sheep
and
the
rough-coated
*NL*
keen-eyed
dog
,
its
guardian
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
spoken
of
Mr.
Rochester
as
an
old
friend
.
A
curious
friendship
*NL*
theirs
must
have
been
:
a
pointed
illustration
,
indeed
,
of
the
old
adage
*NL*
that
``
extremes
meet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Two
or
three
of
the
gentlemen
sat
near
him
,
and
I
caught
at
times
scraps
*NL*
of
their
conversation
across
the
room
.
At
first
I
could
not
make
much
*NL*
sense
of
what
I
heard
;
for
the
discourse
of
Louisa
Eshton
and
Mary
*NL*
Ingram
,
who
sat
nearer
to
me
,
confused
the
fragmentary
sentences
that
*NL*
reached
me
at
intervals
.
These
last
were
discussing
the
stranger
;
they
*NL*
both
called
him
``
a
beautiful
man
.
''
Louisa
said
he
was
``
a
love
of
a
*NL*
creature
,
''
and
she
``
adored
him
;
''
and
Mary
instanced
his
``
pretty
little
*NL*
mouth
,
and
nice
nose
,
''
as
her
ideal
of
the
charming
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
a
sweet-tempered
forehead
he
has
!
''
cried
Louisa
,
--
``
so
*NL*
smooth
--
none
of
those
frowning
irregularities
I
dislike
so
much
;
and
such
*NL*
a
placid
eye
and
smile
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
,
to
my
great
relief
,
Mr.
Henry
Lynn
summoned
them
to
the
other
*NL*
side
of
the
room
,
to
settle
some
point
about
the
deferred
excursion
to
*NL*
Hay
Common
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
now
able
to
concentrate
my
attention
on
the
group
by
the
fire
,
and
*NL*
I
presently
gathered
that
the
new-comer
was
called
Mr.
Mason
;
then
I
*NL*
learned
that
he
was
but
just
arrived
in
England
,
and
that
he
came
from
*NL*
some
hot
country
:
which
was
the
reason
,
doubtless
,
his
face
was
so
*NL*
sallow
,
and
that
he
sat
so
near
the
hearth
,
and
wore
a
surtout
in
the
*NL*
house
.
Presently
the
words
Jamaica
,
Kingston
,
Spanish
Town
,
indicated
*NL*
the
West
Indies
as
his
residence
;
and
it
was
with
no
little
surprise
I
*NL*
gathered
,
ere
long
,
that
he
had
there
first
seen
and
become
acquainted
*NL*
with
Mr.
Rochester
.
He
spoke
of
his
friend
's
dislike
of
the
burning
*NL*
heats
,
the
hurricanes
,
and
rainy
seasons
of
that
region
.
I
knew
Mr.
*NL*
Rochester
had
been
a
traveller
:
Mrs.
Fairfax
had
said
so
;
but
I
thought
*NL*
the
continent
of
Europe
had
bounded
his
wanderings
;
till
now
I
had
never
*NL*
heard
a
hint
given
of
visits
to
more
distant
shores
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
pondering
these
things
,
when
an
incident
,
and
a
somewhat
unexpected
*NL*
one
,
broke
the
thread
of
my
musings
.
Mr.
Mason
,
shivering
as
some
one
*NL*
chanced
to
open
the
door
,
asked
for
more
coal
to
be
put
on
the
fire
,
*NL*
which
had
burnt
out
its
flame
,
though
its
mass
of
cinder
still
shone
hot
*NL*
and
red
.
The
footman
who
brought
the
coal
,
in
going
out
,
stopped
near
*NL*
Mr.
Eshton
's
chair
,
and
said
something
to
him
in
a
low
voice
,
of
which
I
*NL*
heard
only
the
words
,
``
old
woman
,
''
--
``
quite
troublesome
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
her
she
shall
be
put
in
the
stocks
if
she
does
not
take
herself
*NL*
off
,
''
replied
the
magistrate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
stop
!
''
interrupted
Colonel
Dent
.
``
Do
n't
send
her
away
,
Eshton
;
we
*NL*
might
turn
the
thing
to
account
;
better
consult
the
ladies
.
''
And
*NL*
speaking
aloud
,
he
continued
--
``
Ladies
,
you
talked
of
going
to
Hay
Common
*NL*
to
visit
the
gipsy
camp
;
Sam
here
says
that
one
of
the
old
Mother
Bunches
*NL*
is
in
the
servants
'
hall
at
this
moment
,
and
insists
upon
being
brought
*NL*
in
before
`
the
quality
,
'
to
tell
them
their
fortunes
.
Would
you
like
to
*NL*
see
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
,
colonel
,
''
cried
Lady
Ingram
,
``
you
would
not
encourage
such
a
low
*NL*
impostor
?
Dismiss
her
,
by
all
means
,
at
once
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
can
not
persuade
her
to
go
away
,
my
lady
,
''
said
the
footman
;
``
nor
*NL*
can
any
of
the
servants
:
Mrs.
Fairfax
is
with
her
just
now
,
entreating
*NL*
her
to
be
gone
;
but
she
has
taken
a
chair
in
the
chimney-corner
,
and
says
*NL*
nothing
shall
stir
her
from
it
till
she
gets
leave
to
come
in
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
she
want
?
''
asked
Mrs.
Eshton
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
To
tell
the
gentry
their
fortunes
,
'
she
says
,
ma'am
;
and
she
swears
she
*NL*
must
and
will
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
she
like
?
''
inquired
the
Misses
Eshton
,
in
a
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
shockingly
ugly
old
creature
,
miss
;
almost
as
black
as
a
crock
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
she
's
a
real
sorceress
!
''
cried
Frederick
Lynn
.
``
Let
us
have
her
*NL*
in
,
of
course
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
,
''
rejoined
his
brother
;
``
it
would
be
a
thousand
pities
to
*NL*
throw
away
such
a
chance
of
fun
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
boys
,
what
are
you
thinking
about
?
''
exclaimed
Mrs.
Lynn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
possibly
countenance
any
such
inconsistent
proceeding
,
''
chimed
*NL*
in
the
Dowager
Ingram
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
mama
,
but
you
can
--
and
will
,
''
pronounced
the
haughty
voice
of
*NL*
Blanche
,
as
she
turned
round
on
the
piano-stool
;
where
till
now
she
had
*NL*
sat
silent
,
apparently
examining
sundry
sheets
of
music
.
``
I
have
a
*NL*
curiosity
to
hear
my
fortune
told
:
therefore
,

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
darling
Blanche
!
recollect

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do

I
recollect
all
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
yes

yes

cried
all
the
juveniles
,
both
ladies
and
gentlemen
.
``
Let
*NL*
her
come
--
it
will
be
excellent
sport
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
footman
still
lingered
.
``
She
looks
such
a
rough
one
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
!
''
ejaculated
Miss
Ingram
,
and
the
man
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
Excitement
instantly
seized
the
whole
party
:
a
running
fire
of
raillery
*NL*
and
jests
was
proceeding
when
Sam
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
wo
n't
come
now
,
''
said
he
.
``
She
says
it
's
not
her
mission
to
appear
*NL*
before
the
`
vulgar
herd

-LRB-

her
words
-RRB-
.
I
must
show
her
into
a
room
*NL*
by
herself
,
and
then
those
who
wish
to
consult
her
must
go
to
her
one
by
*NL*
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
now
,
my
queenly
Blanche
,
''
began
Lady
Ingram
,
``
she
encroaches
.
Be
*NL*
advised

my
angel
girl

and

*NL*
*NL*
``
Show

cut
in
the
``

.
''
``
It
is
*NL*
not
my

Is
there
a

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

she
looks
such
a

*NL*
*NL*
``
Cease
that
chatter

blockhead
!
and
do
my

''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
Sam
vanished
;
and
mystery
,
animation
,
expectation
rose
to
full
flow
*NL*
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
ready
now
,
''
said
the
footman
,
as
he
reappeared
.
``
She
wishes
to
*NL*
know
who
will
be
her
first
visitor

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
had
better
just
look
in
upon

*NL*
said
Colonel
Dent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell

,
Sam
,

*NL*
*NL*
Sam
went
and
returned
.

*NL*
``
She
says

he
added
,
with
difficulty
suppressing
*NL*
a
titter
,
``
any

the
young
,
and

*NL*
*NL*
``
By
Jove

exclaimed
Henry
Lynn
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Ingram
rose
solemnly
:
``
I
go
first
,
''
she
said
,
in
a
tone
which
might
*NL*
have
befitted
the
leader
of
a
forlorn
hope
,
mounting
a
breach
in
the
van
*NL*
of
his
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
best
!
oh
,
my
dearest
!
pause
--
reflect
!
''
was
her
mama
's
cry
;
but
*NL*
she
swept
past
her
in
stately
silence
,
passed
through
the
door
which
*NL*
Colonel
Dent
held
open
,
and
we
heard
her
enter
the
library
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
comparative
silence
ensued
.
Lady
Ingram
thought
it
``
le
cas
''
to
wring
*NL*
her
hands
:
which
she
did
accordingly
.
Miss
Mary
declared
she
felt
,
for
*NL*
her
part
,
she
never
dared
venture
.
Amy
and
Louisa
Eshton
tittered
under
*NL*
their
breath
,
and
looked
a
little
frightened
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
minutes
passed
very
slowly
:
fifteen
were
counted
before
the
library
-
*NL*
door
again
opened
.
Miss
Ingram
returned
to
us
through
the
arch
.
*NL*
*NL*
Would
she
laugh
?
Would
she
take
it
as
a
joke
?
All
eyes
met
her
with
a
*NL*
glance
of
eager
curiosity
,
and
she
met
all
eyes
with
one
of
rebuff
and
*NL*
coldness
;
she
looked
neither
flurried
nor
merry
:
she
walked
stiffly
to
*NL*
her
seat
,
and
took
it
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Blanche
?
''
said
Lord
Ingram
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
she
say
,
sister
?
''
asked
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
you
think
?
How
do
you
feel
?
--
Is
she
a
real
fortune-teller
?
''
*NL*
demanded
the
Misses
Eshton
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
now
,
good
people
,
''
returned
Miss
Ingram
,
``
do
n't
press
upon
me
.
*NL*
Really
your
organs
of
wonder
and
credulity
are
easily
excited
:
you
seem
,
*NL*
by
the
importance
of
you
all
--
my
good
mama
included
--
ascribe
to
this
*NL*
matter
,
absolutely
to
believe
we
have
a
genuine
witch
in
the
house
,
who
*NL*
is
in
close
alliance
with
the
old
gentleman
.
I
have
seen
a
gipsy
*NL*
vagabond
;
she
has
practised
in
hackneyed
fashion
the
science
of
palmistry
*NL*
and
told
me
what
such
people
usually
tell
.
My
whim
is
gratified
;
and
now
*NL*
I
think
Mr.
Eshton
will
do
well
to
put
the
hag
in
the
stocks
to-morrow
*NL*
morning
,
as
he
threatened
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Ingram
took
a
book
,
leant
back
in
her
chair
,
and
so
declined
further
*NL*
conversation
.
I
watched
her
for
nearly
half-an-hour
:
during
all
that
*NL*
time
she
never
turned
a
page
,
and
her
face
grew
momently
darker
,
more
*NL*
dissatisfied
,
and
more
sourly
expressive
of
disappointment
.
She
had
*NL*
obviously
not
heard
anything
to
her
advantage
:
and
it
seemed
to
me
,
from
*NL*
her
prolonged
fit
of
gloom
and
taciturnity
,
that
she
herself
,
*NL*
notwithstanding
her
professed
indifference
,
attached
undue
importance
to
*NL*
whatever
revelations
had
been
made
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LCB-
During
all
that
time
she
never
turned
a
page

,
declared
they
dared
not
go
*NL*
alone
;
and
yet
they
all
wished
to
go
.
A
negotiation
was
opened
through
*NL*
the
medium
of
the
ambassador
,
Sam
;
and
after
much
pacing
to
and
fro
,
*NL*
till
,
I
think
,
the
said
Sam
's
calves
must
have
ached
with
the
exercise
,
*NL*
permission
was
at
last
,
with
great
difficulty
,
extorted
from
the
rigorous
*NL*
Sibyl
,
for
the
three
to
wait
upon
her
in
a
body
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
visit
was
not
so
still
as
Miss
Ingram
's
had
been
:
we
heard
*NL*
hysterical
giggling
and
little
shrieks
proceeding
from
the
library
;
and
*NL*
at
the
end
of
about
twenty
minutes
they
burst
the
door
open
,
and
came
*NL*
running
across
the
hall
,
as
if
they
were
half-scared
out
of
their
wits
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
she
is
something
not
right
!
''
they
cried
,
one
and
all
.
``
She
*NL*
told
us
such
things
!
She
knows
all
about
us
!
''
and
they
sank
breathless
*NL*
into
the
various
seats
the
gentlemen
hastened
to
bring
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pressed
for
further
explanation
,
they
declared
she
had
told
them
of
*NL*
things
they
had
said
and
done
when
they
were
mere
children
;
described
*NL*
books
and
ornaments
they
had
in
their
boudoirs
at
home
:
keepsakes
that
*NL*
different
relations
had
presented
to
them
.
They
affirmed
that
she
had
*NL*
even
divined
their
thoughts
,
and
had
whispered
in
the
ear
of
each
the
*NL*
name
of
the
person
she
liked
best
in
the
world
,
and
informed
them
of
what
*NL*
they
most
wished
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
gentlemen
interposed
with
earnest
petitions
to
be
further
*NL*
enlightened
on
these
two
last-named
points
;
but
they
got
only
blushes
,
*NL*
ejaculations
,
tremors
,
and
titters
,
in
return
for
their
importunity
.
The
*NL*
matrons
,
meantime
,
offered
vinaigrettes
and
wielded
fans
;
and
again
and
*NL*
again
reiterated
the
expression
of
their
concern
that
their
warning
had
*NL*
not
been
taken
in
time
;
and
the
elder
gentlemen
laughed
,
and
the
younger
*NL*
urged
their
services
on
the
agitated
fair
ones
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
midst
of
the
tumult
,
and
while
my
eyes
and
ears
were
fully
engaged
*NL*
in
the
scene
before
me
,
I
heard
a
hem
close
at
my
elbow
:
I
turned
,
and
*NL*
saw
Sam
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
please
,
miss
,
the
gipsy
declares
that
there
is
another
young
*NL*
single
lady
in
the
room
who
has
not
been
to
her
yet
,
and
she
swears
she
*NL*
will
not
go
till
she
has
seen
all
.
I
thought
it
must
be
you
:
there
is
no
*NL*
one
else
for
it
.
What
shall
I
tell
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
will
go
by
all
means
,
''
I
answered
:
and
I
was
glad
of
the
*NL*
unexpected
opportunity
to
gratify
my
much-excited
curiosity
.
I
slipped
*NL*
out
of
the
room
,
unobserved
by
any
eye
--
for
the
company
were
gathered
in
*NL*
one
mass
about
the
trembling
trio
just
returned
--
and
I
closed
the
door
*NL*
quietly
behind
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
like
,
miss

''
said
Sam
,
``
I
'll
wait
in
the
hall
for
you
;
and
if
she
*NL*
frightens
you
,
just
call
and
I
'll
come
in

*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Sam
,
return
to
the
kitchen
:
I
am
not
in
the
least
afraid

Nor
was
*NL*
I
;
but
I
was
a
good
deal
interested
and
excited
.

CHAPTER
XIX
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
library
looked
tranquil
enough
as
I
entered
it
,
and
the
Sibyl
--
if
*NL*
Sibyl
she
were
--
was
seated
snugly
enough
in
an
easy-chair
at
the
chimney
-
*NL*
corner
.
She
had
on
a
red
cloak
and
a
black
bonnet
:
or
rather
,
a
broad
-
*NL*
brimmed
gipsy
hat
,
tied
down
with
a
striped
handkerchief
under
her
chin
.
*NL*
An
extinguished
candle
stood
on
the
table
;
she
was
bending
over
the
fire
,
*NL*
and
seemed
reading
in
a
little
black
book
,
like
a
prayer-book
,
by
the
*NL*
light
of
the
blaze
:
she
muttered
the
words
to
herself
,
as
most
old
women
*NL*
do
,
while
she
read
;
she
did
not
desist
immediately
on
my
entrance
:
it
*NL*
appeared
she
wished
to
finish
a
paragraph
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
stood
on
the
rug
and
warmed
my
hands
,
which
were
rather
cold
with
*NL*
sitting
at
a
distance
from
the
drawing-room
fire
.
I
felt
now
as
composed
*NL*
as
ever
I
did
in
my
life
:
there
was
nothing
indeed
in
the
gipsy
's
*NL*
appearance
to
trouble
one
's
calm
.
She
shut
her
book
and
slowly
looked
*NL*
up
;
her
hat-brim
partially
shaded
her
face
,
yet
I
could
see
,
as
she
*NL*
raised
it
,
that
it
was
a
strange
one
.
It
looked
all
brown
and
black
:
elf
-
*NL*
locks
bristled
out
from
beneath
a
white
band
which
passed
under
her
chin
,
*NL*
and
came
half
over
her
cheeks
,
or
rather
jaws
:
her
eye
confronted
me
at
*NL*
once
,
with
a
bold
and
direct
gaze
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
you
want
your
fortune
told
?
''
she
said
,
in
a
voice
as
decided
*NL*
as
her
glance
,
as
harsh
as
her
features
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
care
about
it
,
mother
;
you
may
please
yourself
:
but
I
ought
to
*NL*
warn
you
,
I
have
no
faith
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
like
your
impudence
to
say
so
:
I
expected
it
of
you
;
I
heard
it
in
*NL*
your
step
as
you
crossed
the
threshold
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
?
You
've
a
quick
ear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
;
and
a
quick
eye
and
a
quick
brain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
need
them
all
in
your
trade
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
;
especially
when
I
've
customers
like
you
to
deal
with
.
Why
do
n't
*NL*
you
tremble
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
cold
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
turn
pale
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
sick
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
consult
my
art
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
silly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
crone
``
nichered
''
a
laugh
under
her
bonnet
and
bandage
;
she
then
*NL*
drew
out
a
short
black
pipe
,
and
lighting
it
began
to
smoke
.
Having
*NL*
indulged
a
while
in
this
sedative
,
she
raised
her
bent
body
,
took
the
*NL*
pipe
from
her
lips
,
and
while
gazing
steadily
at
the
fire
,
said
very
*NL*
deliberately
--
``
You
are
cold
;
you
are
sick
;
and
you
are
silly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Prove
it
,
''
I
rejoined
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
,
in
few
words
.
You
are
cold
,
because
you
are
alone
:
no
contact
*NL*
strikes
the
fire
from
you
that
is
in
you
.
You
are
sick
;
because
the
best
*NL*
of
feelings
,
the
highest
and
the
sweetest
given
to
man
,
keeps
far
away
*NL*
from
you
.
You
are
silly
,
because
,
suffer
as
you
may
,
you
will
not
beckon
*NL*
it
to
approach
,
nor
will
you
stir
one
step
to
meet
it
where
it
waits
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
again
put
her
short
black
pipe
to
her
lips
,
and
renewed
her
smoking
*NL*
with
vigour
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
might
say
all
that
to
almost
any
one
who
you
knew
lived
as
a
*NL*
solitary
dependent
in
a
great
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
might
say
it
to
almost
any
one

but
would
it
be
true
of
almost
any

one

*NL*
*NL*
``
In
my
circumstances

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

just
so

in

your

but
find
me
another

*NL*
placed
as
you
are

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
easy
to
find
you
thousands

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
could
scarcely
find

you
knew
it
,
you
are
peculiarly

situated
:
very
near
happiness
;
yes
,
within
reach
of
it
.
The
materials
*NL*
are
all
prepared
;
there
only
wants
a
movement
to
combine
them
.
Chance
*NL*
laid
them
somewhat
apart
;
let
them
be
once
approached
and
bliss
results

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
enigmas

I
never
could
guess
a
riddle
in
my
life

*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
wish
me
to
speak
more
plainly

show
me
your
palm

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
must
cross
it
with
silver
,
I
suppose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
gave
her
a
shilling
:
she
put
it
into
an
old
stocking-foot
which
she
*NL*
took
out
of
her
pocket
,
and
having
tied
it
round
and
returned
it
,
she
*NL*
told
me
to
hold
out
my
hand
.
I
did
.
She
approached
her
face
to
the
*NL*
palm
,
and
pored
over
it
without
touching
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
too
fine
,
''
said
she
.
``
I
can
make
nothing
of
such
a
hand
as
that
;
*NL*
almost
without
lines

besides
,
what
is
in
a
palm
?
Destiny
is
not
written
*NL*
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
you
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

''
she
continued
,
``
it
is
in
the
face

on
the
forehead

about

eyes

in
the

Kneel

and
lift
up
your
head

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
now
you
are
coming
to
reality

I
said
,
as
I
obeyed
her
.
``
I
shall
*NL*
begin
to
put
some
faith
in
you
presently
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
knelt
within
half
a
yard
of
her
.
She
stirred
the
fire
,
so
that
a
*NL*
ripple
of
light
broke
from
the
disturbed
coal
:
the
glare
,
however
,
as
she
*NL*
sat
,
only
threw
her
face
into
deeper
shadow
:
mine
,
it
illumined
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
with
what
feelings
you
came
to
me
to-night

she
said

when
she
*NL*
had
examined
me
a
while

fine
people
flitting

before
you

magic-lantern

just
as
little
sympathetic

communion
passing
between

*NL*
``
Not

money
enough

Mobile

it
was
never
*NL*
intended

be
compressed
in

eternal
silence

it
is
a

mouth

should
speak

smile
often

have
human
affection

acted

try

beyond

*NL*
*NL*
Where
was
I
?
Did
I
wake
or
sleep

Had
I
been
dreaming

Did
I
dream
*NL*
still
?
The
old
woman
's
voice
had
changed
:
her
accent
,
her
gesture
,
and
*NL*
all
were
familiar
to
me
as
my
own
face
in
a
glass
--
as
the
speech
of
my
*NL*
own
tongue

I
got
up
,
but
did
not
go
.
I
looked
;
I
stirred
the
fire
,
and
*NL*
I
looked
again
:
but
she
drew
her
bonnet
and
her
bandage
closer
about
her
*NL*
face
,
and
again
beckoned
me
to
depart
.
The
flame
illuminated
her
hand
*NL*
stretched
out
:
roused
now
,
and
on
the
alert
for
discoveries
,
I
at
once
*NL*
noticed
that
hand
.
It
was
no
more
the
withered
limb
of
eld
than
my
own
;
*NL*
it
was
a
rounded
supple
member
,
with
smooth
fingers
,
symmetrically
*NL*
turned
;
a
broad
ring
flashed
on
the
little
finger
,
and
stooping
forward
,
*NL*
I
looked
at
it
,
and
saw
a
gem
I
had
seen
a
hundred
times
before
.
Again
I
*NL*
looked
at
the
face
;
which
was
no
longer
turned
from
me

on
the
contrary
,
*NL*
the
bonnet
was
doffed

the
bandage
displaced

the
head
advanced

``

*NL*
``

had

comfort

indeed

I
had
been
on
my
guard
almost
from
the
beginning
of
the

interview

Something
of
masquerade
I
suspected

I
knew
gipsies
and
*NL*
fortune-tellers
did
not
express
themselves

this
seeming
old

expressed
herself

besides
I
had
noted
her
feigned
voice

her
anxiety

conceal
her
features

But
my
mind
had
been
running
on
Grace
Poole
--
that
*NL*
living
enigma
,
that
mystery
of
mysteries

as
I
considered
her

I
had
*NL*
never
thought
of

*NL*
``

standing
near

gave

froze

his
breath

reiterated

went
over
the

three

growing

in
the
intervals

speaking

whiter

sir
?
''
I
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jane
,
I
've
got
a
blow
;
I
've
got
a
blow
,
Jane
!
''
He
staggered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
lean
on
me
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jane
,
you
offered
me
your
shoulder
once
before
;
let
me
have
it
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
yes
;
and
my
arm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
down
,
and
made
me
sit
beside
him
.
Holding
my
hand
in
both
his
*NL*
own
,
he
chafed
it
;
gazing
on
me
,
at
the
same
time
,
with
the
most
troubled
*NL*
and
dreary
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
little
friend
!
''
said
he
,
``
I
wish
I
were
in
a
quiet
island
with
only
*NL*
you
;
and
trouble
,
and
danger
,
and
hideous
recollections
removed
from
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
I
help
you
,
sir
?
--
I
'd
give
my
life
to
serve
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jane
,
if
aid
is
wanted
,
I
'll
seek
it
at
your
hands
;
I
promise
you
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
sir
.
Tell
me
what
to
do
,
--
I
'll
try
,
at
least
,
to
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fetch
me
now
,
Jane
,
a
glass
of
wine
from
the
dining-room
:
they
will
be
*NL*
at
supper
there
;
and
tell
me
if
Mason
is
with
them
,
and
what
he
is
*NL*
doing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
.
I
found
all
the
party
in
the
dining-room
at
supper
,
as
Mr.
*NL*
Rochester
had
said
;
they
were
not
seated
at
table
,
--
the
supper
was
*NL*
arranged
on
the
sideboard
;
each
had
taken
what
he
chose
,
and
they
stood
*NL*
about
here
and
there
in
groups
,
their
plates
and
glasses
in
their
hands
.
*NL*
Every
one
seemed
in
high
glee
;
laughter
and
conversation
were
general
and
*NL*
animated
.
Mr.
Mason
stood
near
the
fire
,
talking
to
Colonel
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Dent
,
and
appeared
as
merry
as
any
of
them
.
I
filled
a
wine-glass
-LRB-
I
saw
*NL*
Miss
Ingram
watch
me
frowningly
as
I
did
so
:
she
thought
I
was
taking
a
*NL*
liberty
,
I
daresay
-RRB-
,
and
I
returned
to
the
library
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Rochester
's
extreme
pallor
had
disappeared
,
and
he
looked
once
more
*NL*
firm
and
stern
.
He
took
the
glass
from
my
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
is
to
your
health
,
ministrant
spirit
!
''
he
said
.
He
swallowed
the
*NL*
contents
and
returned
it
to
me
.
``
What
are
they
doing
,
Jane
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Laughing
and
talking
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
do
n't
look
grave
and
mysterious
,
as
if
they
had
heard
something
*NL*
strange
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
:
they
are
full
of
jests
and
gaiety
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Mason
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
laughing
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
all
these
people
came
in
a
body
and
spat
at
me
,
what
would
you
do
,
*NL*
Jane
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Turn
them
out
of
the
room
,
sir
,
if
I
could
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
half
smiled
.
``
But
if
I
were
to
go
to
them
,
and
they
only
looked
at
me
*NL*
coldly
,
and
whispered
sneeringly
amongst
each
other
,
and
then
dropped
off
*NL*
and
left
me
one
by
one
,
what
then
?
Would
you
go
with
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
rather
think
not
,
sir
:
I
should
have
more
pleasure
in
staying
with
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
comfort
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
to
comfort
you
,
as
well
as
I
could
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
if
they
laid
you
under
a
ban
for
adhering
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
,
probably
,
should
know
nothing
about
their
ban
;
and
if
I
did
,
I
should
*NL*
care
nothing
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
you
could
dare
censure
for
my
sake
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
dare
it
for
the
sake
of
any
friend
who
deserved
my
adherence
;
as
*NL*
you
,
I
am
sure
,
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
back
now
into
the
room
;
step
quietly
up
to
Mason
,
and
whisper
in
his
*NL*
ear
that
Mr.
Rochester
is
come
and
wishes
to
see
him
:
show
him
in
here
*NL*
and
then
leave
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
his
behest
.
The
company
all
stared
at
me
as
I
passed
straight
*NL*
among
them
.
I
sought
Mr.
Mason
,
delivered
the
message
,
and
preceded
him
*NL*
from
the
room
:
I
ushered
him
into
the
library
,
and
then
I
went
upstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
a
late
hour
,
after
I
had
been
in
bed
some
time
,
I
heard
the
visitors
*NL*
repair
to
their
chambers
:
I
distinguished
Mr.
Rochester
's
voice
,
and
*NL*
heard
him
say
,
``
This
way
,
Mason
;
this
is
your
room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
spoke
cheerfully
:
the
gay
tones
set
my
heart
at
ease
.
I
was
soon
*NL*
asleep
.

CHAPTER
XX
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
forgotten
to
draw
my
curtain
,
which
I
usually
did
,
and
also
to
let
*NL*
down
my
window-blind
.
The
consequence
was
,
that
when
the
moon
,
which
was
*NL*
full
and
bright
-LRB-
for
the
night
was
fine
-RRB-
,
came
in
her
course
to
that
*NL*
space
in
the
sky
opposite
my
casement
,
and
looked
in
at
me
through
the
*NL*
unveiled
panes
,
her
glorious
gaze
roused
me
.
Awaking
in
the
dead
of
*NL*
night
,
I
opened
my
eyes
on
her
disk
--
silver-white
and
crystal
clear
.
It
*NL*
was
beautiful
,
but
too
solemn
;
I
half
rose
,
and
stretched
my
arm
to
draw
*NL*
the
curtain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Good
God
!
What
a
cry
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
night
--
its
silence
--
its
rest
,
was
rent
in
twain
by
a
savage
,
a
sharp
,
*NL*
a
shrilly
sound
that
ran
from
end
to
end
of
Thornfield
Hall
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
pulse
stopped
:
my
heart
stood
still
;
my
stretched
arm
was
paralysed
.
*NL*
The
cry
died
,
and
was
not
renewed
.
Indeed
,
whatever
being
uttered
that
*NL*
fearful
shriek
could
not
soon
repeat
it
:
not
the
widest-winged
condor
on
*NL*
the
Andes
could
,
twice
in
succession
,
send
out
such
a
yell
from
the
cloud
*NL*
shrouding
his
eyrie
.
The
thing
delivering
such
utterance
must
rest
ere
*NL*
it
could
repeat
the
effort
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
came
out
of
the
third
storey
;
for
it
passed
overhead
.
And
*NL*
overhead
--
yes
,
in
the
room
just
above
my
chamber-ceiling
--
I
now
heard
a
*NL*
struggle
:
a
deadly
one
it
seemed
from
the
noise
;
and
a
half-smothered
*NL*
voice
shouted
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Help
!
help
!
help
!
''
three
times
rapidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
no
one
come
?
''
it
cried
;
and
then
,
while
the
staggering
and
stamping
*NL*
went
on
wildly
,
I
distinguished
through
plank
and
plaster
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rochester
!
Rochester
!
for
God
's
sake
,
come
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
chamber-door
opened
:
some
one
ran
,
or
rushed
,
along
the
gallery
.
*NL*
Another
step
stamped
on
the
flooring
above
and
something
fell
;
and
there
*NL*
was
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
put
on
some
clothes
,
though
horror
shook
all
my
limbs
;
I
issued
*NL*
from
my
apartment
.
The
sleepers
were
all
aroused
:
ejaculations
,
*NL*
terrified
murmurs
sounded
in
every
room
;
door
after
door
unclosed
;
one
*NL*
looked
out
and
another
looked
out
;
the
gallery
filled
.
Gentlemen
and
*NL*
ladies
alike
had
quitted
their
beds
;
and
``
Oh
!
what
is
it
?
''
--
``
Who
is
*NL*
hurt
?
''
--
``
What
has
happened
?
''
--
``
Fetch
a
light
!
''
--
``
Is
it
fire
?
''
--
``
Are
there
*NL*
robbers
?
''
--
``
Where
shall
we
run
?
''
was
demanded
confusedly
on
all
hands
.
*NL*
But
for
the
moonlight
they
would
have
been
in
complete
darkness
.
They
*NL*
ran
to
and
fro
;
they
crowded
together
:
some
sobbed
,
some
stumbled
:
the
*NL*
confusion
was
inextricable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
the
devil
is
Rochester
?
''
cried
Colonel
Dent
.
``
I
can
not
find
him
*NL*
in
his
bed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
!
here
!
''
was
shouted
in
return
.
``
Be
composed
,
all
of
you
:
I
'm
*NL*
coming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
door
at
the
end
of
the
gallery
opened
,
and
Mr.
Rochester
advanced
*NL*
with
a
candle
:
he
had
just
descended
from
the
upper
storey
.
One
of
the
*NL*
ladies
ran
to
him
directly
;
she
seized
his
arm
:
it
was
Miss
Ingram
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
awful
event
has
taken
place
?
''
said
she
.
``
Speak
!
let
us
know
the
*NL*
worst
at
once
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
do
n't
pull
me
down
or
strangle
me
,
''
he
replied
:
for
the
Misses
*NL*
Eshton
were
clinging
about
him
now
;
and
the
two
dowagers
,
in
vast
white
*NL*
wrappers
,
were
bearing
down
on
him
like
ships
in
full
sail
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
's
right
!
--
all
's
right
!
''
he
cried
.
``
It
's
a
mere
rehearsal
of
Much
*NL*
Ado
about
Nothing
.
Ladies
,
keep
off
,
or
I
shall
wax
dangerous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
dangerous
he
looked
:
his
black
eyes
darted
sparks
.
Calming
himself
*NL*
by
an
effort
,
he
added
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
servant
has
had
the
nightmare
;
that
is
all
.
She
's
an
excitable
,
*NL*
nervous
person
:
she
construed
her
dream
into
an
apparition
,
or
something
*NL*
of
that
sort
,
no
doubt
;
and
has
taken
a
fit
with
fright
.
Now
,
then
,
I
*NL*
must
see
you
all
back
into
your
rooms
;
for
,
till
the
house
is
settled
,
*NL*
she
can
not
be
looked
after
.
Gentlemen
,
have
the
goodness
to
set
the
*NL*
ladies
the
example
.
Miss
Ingram
,
I
am
sure
you
will
not
fail
in
evincing
*NL*
superiority
to
idle
terrors
.
Amy
and
Louisa
,
return
to
your
nests
like
a
*NL*
pair
of
doves
,
as
you
are
.
Mesdames
''
-LRB-
to
the
dowagers
-RRB-
,
``
you
will
take
*NL*
cold
to
a
dead
certainty
,
if
you
stay
in
this
chill
gallery
any
longer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
,
by
dint
of
alternate
coaxing
and
commanding
,
he
contrived
to
get
*NL*
them
all
once
more
enclosed
in
their
separate
dormitories
.
I
did
not
*NL*
wait
to
be
ordered
back
to
mine
,
but
retreated
unnoticed
,
as
unnoticed
I
*NL*
had
left
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
,
however
,
to
go
to
bed
:
on
the
contrary
,
I
began
and
dressed
myself
*NL*
carefully
.
The
sounds
I
had
heard
after
the
scream
,
and
the
words
that
*NL*
had
been
uttered
,
had
probably
been
heard
only
by
me
;
for
they
had
*NL*
proceeded
from
the
room
above
mine
:
but
they
assured
me
that
it
was
not
a
*NL*
servant
's
dream
which
had
thus
struck
horror
through
the
house
;
and
that
*NL*
the
explanation
Mr.
Rochester
had
given
was
merely
an
invention
framed
to
*NL*
pacify
his
guests
.
I
dressed
,
then
,
to
be
ready
for
emergencies
.
When
*NL*
dressed
,
I
sat
a
long
time
by
the
window
looking
out
over
the
silent
*NL*
grounds
and
silvered
fields
and
waiting
for
I
knew
not
what
.
It
seemed
*NL*
to
me
that
some
event
must
follow
the
strange
cry
,
struggle
,
and
call
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
:
stillness
returned
:
each
murmur
and
movement
ceased
gradually
,
and
in
*NL*
about
an
hour
Thornfield
Hall
was
again
as
hushed
as
a
desert
.
It
seemed
*NL*
that
sleep
and
night
had
resumed
their
empire
.
Meantime
the
moon
*NL*
declined
:
she
was
about
to
set
.
Not
liking
to
sit
in
the
cold
and
*NL*
darkness
,
I
thought
I
would
lie
down
on
my
bed
,
dressed
as
I
was
.
I
left
*NL*
the
window
,
and
moved
with
little
noise
across
the
carpet
;
as
I
stooped
*NL*
to
take
off
my
shoes
,
a
cautious
hand
tapped
low
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Am
I
wanted
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
up
?
''
asked
the
voice
I
expected
to
hear
,
viz.
,
my
master
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
dressed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
out
,
then
,
quietly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
obeyed
.
Mr.
Rochester
stood
in
the
gallery
holding
a
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
you
,
''
he
said
:
``
come
this
way
:
take
your
time
,
and
make
no
*NL*
noise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
slippers
were
thin
:
I
could
walk
the
matted
floor
as
softly
as
a
cat
.
*NL*
He
glided
up
the
gallery
and
up
the
stairs
,
and
stopped
in
the
dark
,
low
*NL*
corridor
of
the
fateful
third
storey
:
I
had
followed
and
stood
at
his
*NL*
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
a
sponge
in
your
room
?
''
he
asked
in
a
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
any
salts
--
volatile
salts
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
back
and
fetch
both
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
returned
,
sought
the
sponge
on
the
washstand
,
the
salts
in
my
drawer
,
*NL*
and
once
more
retraced
my
steps
.
He
still
waited
;
he
held
a
key
in
his
*NL*
hand
:
approaching
one
of
the
small
,
black
doors
,
he
put
it
in
the
lock
;
*NL*
he
paused
,
and
addressed
me
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
turn
sick
at
the
sight
of
blood
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
shall
not
:
I
have
never
been
tried
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
a
thrill
while
I
answered
him
;
but
no
coldness
,
and
no
faintness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
give
me
your
hand
,
''
he
said
:
``
it
will
not
do
to
risk
a
fainting
*NL*
fit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
put
my
fingers
into
his
.
``
Warm
and
steady
,
''
was
his
remark
:
he
turned
*NL*
the
key
and
opened
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
saw
a
room
I
remembered
to
have
seen
before
,
the
day
Mrs.
Fairfax
*NL*
showed
me
over
the
house
:
it
was
hung
with
tapestry
;
but
the
tapestry
was
*NL*
now
looped
up
in
one
part
,
and
there
was
a
door
apparent
,
which
had
then
*NL*
been
concealed
.
This
door
was
open
;
a
light
shone
out
of
the
room
*NL*
within
:
I
heard
thence
a
snarling
,
snatching
sound
,
almost
like
a
dog
*NL*
quarrelling
.
Mr.
Rochester
,
putting
down
his
candle
,
said
to
me
,
``
Wait
a
*NL*
minute
,
''
and
he
went
forward
to
the
inner
apartment
.
A
shout
of
laughter
*NL*
greeted
his
entrance
;
noisy
at
first
,
and
terminating
in
Grace
Poole
's
*NL*
own
goblin
ha
!
ha
!
_
She
_
then
was
there
.
He
made
some
sort
of
*NL*
arrangement
without
speaking
,
though
I
heard
a
low
voice
address
him
:
he
*NL*
came
out
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
Jane
!
''
he
said
;
and
I
walked
round
to
the
other
side
of
a
large
*NL*
bed
,
which
with
its
drawn
curtains
concealed
a
considerable
portion
of
*NL*
the
chamber
.
An
easy-chair
was
near
the
bed-head
:
a
man
sat
in
it
,
*NL*
dressed
with
the
exception
of
his
coat
;
he
was
still
;
his
head
leant
*NL*
back
;
his
eyes
were
closed
.
Mr.
Rochester
held
the
candle
over
him
;
I
*NL*
recognised
in
his
pale
and
seemingly
lifeless
face
--
the
stranger
,
Mason
:
*NL*
I
saw
too
that
his
linen
on
one
side
,
and
one
arm
,
was
almost
soaked
in
*NL*
blood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
the
candle
,
''
said
Mr.
Rochester
,
and
I
took
it
:
he
fetched
a
basin
*NL*
of
water
from
the
washstand
:
``
Hold
that
,
''
said
he
.
I
obeyed
.
He
took
*NL*
the
sponge
,
dipped
it
in
,
and
moistened
the
corpse-like
face
;
he
asked
*NL*
for
my
smelling-bottle
,
and
applied
it
to
the
nostrils
.
Mr.
Mason
*NL*
shortly
unclosed
his
eyes
;
he
groaned
.
Mr.
Rochester
opened
the
shirt
of
*NL*
the
wounded
man
,
whose
arm
and
shoulder
were
bandaged
:
he
sponged
away
*NL*
blood
,
trickling
fast
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
immediate
danger
?
''
murmured
Mr.
Mason
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pooh
!
No
--
a
mere
scratch
.
Do
n't
be
so
overcome
,
man
:
bear
up
!
I
'll
*NL*
fetch
a
surgeon
for
you
now
,
myself
:
you
'll
be
able
to
be
removed
by
*NL*
morning
,
I
hope
.
Jane
,
''
he
continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
have
to
leave
you
in
this
room
with
this
gentleman
,
for
an
hour
,
*NL*
or
perhaps
two
hours
:
you
will
sponge
the
blood
as
I
do
when
it
returns
:
*NL*
if
he
feels
faint
,
you
will
put
the
glass
of
water
on
that
stand
to
his
*NL*
lips
,
and
your
salts
to
his
nose
.
You
will
not
speak
to
him
on
any
*NL*
pretext
--
and
--
Richard
,
it
will
be
at
the
peril
of
your
life
if
you
speak
*NL*
to
her
:
open
your
lips
--
agitate
yourself
--
and
I
'll
not
answer
for
the
*NL*
consequences
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
the
poor
man
groaned
;
he
looked
as
if
he
dared
not
move
;
fear
,
*NL*
either
of
death
or
of
something
else
,
appeared
almost
to
paralyse
him
.
*NL*
Mr.
Rochester
put
the
now
bloody
sponge
into
my
hand
,
and
I
proceeded
to
*NL*
use
it
as
he
had
done
.
He
watched
me
a
second
,
then
saying
,
*NL*
``
Remember
!
--
No
conversation
,
''
he
left
the
room
.
I
experienced
a
strange
*NL*
feeling
as
the
key
grated
in
the
lock
,
and
the
sound
of
his
retreating
*NL*
step
ceased
to
be
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
then
I
was
in
the
third
storey
,
fastened
into
one
of
its
mystic
*NL*
cells
;
night
around
me
;
a
pale
and
bloody
spectacle
under
my
eyes
and
*NL*
hands
;
a
murderess
hardly
separated
from
me
by
a
single
door
:
yes
--
that
*NL*
was
appalling
--
the
rest
I
could
bear
;
but
I
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
*NL*
Grace
Poole
bursting
out
upon
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
must
keep
to
my
post
,
however
.
I
must
watch
this
ghastly
*NL*
countenance
--
these
blue
,
still
lips
forbidden
to
unclose
--
these
eyes
now
*NL*
shut
,
now
opening
,
now
wandering
through
the
room
,
now
fixing
on
me
,
and
*NL*
ever
glazed
with
the
dulness
of
horror
.
I
must
dip
my
hand
again
and
*NL*
again
in
the
basin
of
blood
and
water
,
and
wipe
away
the
trickling
gore
.
*NL*
I
must
see
the
light
of
the
unsnuffed
candle
wane
on
my
employment
;
the
*NL*
shadows
darken
on
the
wrought
,
antique
tapestry
round
me
,
and
grow
black
*NL*
under
the
hangings
of
the
vast
old
bed
,
and
quiver
strangely
over
the
*NL*
doors
of
a
great
cabinet
opposite
--
whose
front
,
divided
into
twelve
*NL*
panels
,
bore
,
in
grim
design
,
the
heads
of
the
twelve
apostles
,
each
*NL*
enclosed
in
its
separate
panel
as
in
a
frame
;
while
above
them
at
the
top
*NL*
rose
an
ebon
crucifix
and
a
dying
Christ
.
*NL*
*NL*
According
as
the
shifting
obscurity
and
flickering
gleam
hovered
here
or
*NL*
glanced
there
,
it
was
now
the
bearded
physician
,
Luke
,
that
bent
his
*NL*
brow
;
now
St.
John
's
long
hair
that
waved
;
and
anon
the
devilish
face
of
*NL*
Judas
,
that
grew
out
of
the
panel
,
and
seemed
gathering
life
and
*NL*
threatening
a
revelation
of
the
arch-traitor
--
of
Satan
himself
--
in
his
*NL*
subordinate
's
form
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amidst
all
this
,
I
had
to
listen
as
well
as
watch
:
to
listen
for
the
*NL*
movements
of
the
wild
beast
or
the
fiend
in
yonder
side
den
.
But
since
*NL*
Mr.
Rochester
's
visit
it
seemed
spellbound
:
all
the
night
I
heard
but
*NL*
three
sounds
at
three
long
intervals
,
--
a
step
creak
,
a
momentary
renewal
*NL*
of
the
snarling
,
canine
noise
,
and
a
deep
human
groan
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
my
own
thoughts
worried
me
.
What
crime
was
this
that
lived
*NL*
incarnate
in
this
sequestered
mansion
,
and
could
neither
be
expelled
nor
*NL*
subdued
by
the
owner
?
--
what
mystery
,
that
broke
out
now
in
fire
and
now
*NL*
in
blood
,
at
the
deadest
hours
of
night
?
What
creature
was
it
,
that
,
*NL*
masked
in
an
ordinary
woman
's
face
and
shape
,
uttered
the
voice
,
now
of
a
*NL*
mocking
demon
,
and
anon
of
a
carrion-seeking
bird
of
prey
?
*NL*
*NL*
And
this
man
I
bent
over
--
this
commonplace
,
quiet
stranger
--
how
had
he
*NL*
become
involved
in
the
web
of
horror
?
and
why
had
the
Fury
flown
at
him
?
*NL*
What
made
him
seek
this
quarter
of
the
house
at
an
untimely
season
,
when
*NL*
he
should
have
been
asleep
in
bed
?
I
had
heard
Mr.
Rochester
assign
him
*NL*
an
apartment
below
--
what
brought
him
here
!
And
why
,
now
,
was
he
so
tame
*NL*
under
the
violence
or
treachery
done
him
?
Why
did
he
so
quietly
submit
*NL*
to
the
concealment
Mr.
Rochester
enforced
?
Why
_
did
_
Mr.
Rochester
*NL*
enforce
this
concealment
?
His
guest
had
been
outraged
,
his
own
life
on
a
*NL*
former
occasion
had
been
hideously
plotted
against
;
and
both
attempts
he
*NL*
smothered
in
secrecy
and
sank
in
oblivion
!
Lastly
,
I
saw
Mr.
Mason
was
*NL*
submissive
to
Mr.
Rochester
;
that
the
impetuous
will
of
the
latter
held
*NL*
complete
sway
over
the
inertness
of
the
former
:
the
few
words
which
had
*NL*
passed
between
them
assured
me
of
this
.
It
was
evident
that
in
their
*NL*
former
intercourse
,
the
passive
disposition
of
the
one
had
been
*NL*
habitually
influenced
by
the
active
energy
of
the
other
:
whence
then
had
*NL*
arisen
Mr.
Rochester
's
dismay
when
he
heard
of
Mr.
Mason
's
arrival
?
Why
*NL*
had
the
mere
name
of
this
unresisting
individual
--
whom
his
word
now
*NL*
sufficed
to
control
like
a
child
--
fallen
on
him
,
a
few
hours
since
,
as
a
*NL*
thunderbolt
might
fall
on
an
oak
?
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
!
I
could
not
forget
his
look
and
his
paleness
when
he
whispered
:
*NL*
``
Jane
,
I
have
got
a
blow
--
I
have
got
a
blow
,
Jane
.
''
I
could
not
forget
*NL*
how
the
arm
had
trembled
which
he
rested
on
my
shoulder
:
and
it
was
no
*NL*
light
matter
which
could
thus
bow
the
resolute
spirit
and
thrill
the
*NL*
vigorous
frame
of
Fairfax
Rochester
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
will
he
come
?
When
will
he
come
?
''
I
cried
inwardly
,
as
the
night
*NL*
lingered
and
lingered
--
as
my
bleeding
patient
drooped
,
moaned
,
sickened
:
*NL*
and
neither
day
nor
aid
arrived
.
I
had
,
again
and
again
,
held
the
water
*NL*
to
Mason
's
white
lips
;
again
and
again
offered
him
the
stimulating
salts
:
*NL*
my
efforts
seemed
ineffectual
:
either
bodily
or
mental
suffering
,
or
loss
*NL*
of
blood
,
or
all
three
combined
,
were
fast
prostrating
his
strength
.
He
*NL*
moaned
so
,
and
looked
so
weak
,
wild
,
and
lost
,
I
feared
he
was
dying
;
and
*NL*
I
might
not
even
speak
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
candle
,
wasted
at
last
,
went
out
;
as
it
expired
,
I
perceived
streaks
*NL*
of
grey
light
edging
the
window
curtains
:
dawn
was
then
approaching
.
*NL*
Presently
I
heard
Pilot
bark
far
below
,
out
of
his
distant
kennel
in
the
*NL*
courtyard
:
hope
revived
.
Nor
was
it
unwarranted
:
in
five
minutes
more
*NL*
the
grating
key
,
the
yielding
lock
,
warned
me
my
watch
was
relieved
.
It
*NL*
could
not
have
lasted
more
than
two
hours
:
many
a
week
has
seemed
*NL*
shorter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Rochester
entered
,
and
with
him
the
surgeon
he
had
been
to
fetch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Carter
,
be
on
the
alert
,
''
he
said
to
this
last
:
``
I
give
you
but
*NL*
half-an-hour
for
dressing
the
wound
,
fastening
the
bandages
,
getting
the
*NL*
patient
downstairs
and
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
is
he
fit
to
move
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
doubt
of
it
;
it
is
nothing
serious
;
he
is
nervous
,
his
spirits
must
*NL*
be
kept
up
.
Come
,
set
to
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Rochester
drew
back
the
thick
curtain
,
drew
up
the
holland
blind
,
let
*NL*
in
all
the
daylight
he
could
;
and
I
was
surprised
and
cheered
to
see
how
*NL*
far
dawn
was
advanced
:
what
rosy
streaks
were
beginning
to
brighten
the
*NL*
east
.
Then
he
approached
Mason
,
whom
the
surgeon
was
already
handling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
my
good
fellow
,
how
are
you
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
done
for
me
,
I
fear
,
''
was
the
faint
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
whit
!
--
courage
!
This
day
fortnight
you
'll
hardly
be
a
pin
the
*NL*
worse
of
it
:
you
've
lost
a
little
blood
;
that
's
all
.
Carter
,
assure
him
*NL*
there
's
no
danger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
do
that
conscientiously
,
''
said
Carter
,
who
had
now
undone
the
*NL*
bandages
;
``
only
I
wish
I
could
have
got
here
sooner
:
he
would
not
have
*NL*
bled
so
much
--
but
how
is
this
?
The
flesh
on
the
shoulder
is
torn
as
well
*NL*
as
cut
.
This
wound
was
not
done
with
a
knife
:
there
have
been
teeth
*NL*
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
bit
me
,
''
he
murmured
.
``
She
worried
me
like
a
tigress
,
when
*NL*
Rochester
got
the
knife
from
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
not
have
yielded
:
you
should
have
grappled
with
her
at
once
,
''
*NL*
said
Mr.
Rochester
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
under
such
circumstances
,
what
could
one
do
?
''
returned
Mason
.
``
Oh
,
*NL*
it
was
frightful
!
''
he
added
,
shuddering
.
``
And
I
did
not
expect
it
:
she
*NL*
looked
so
quiet
at
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
warned
you
,
''
was
his
friend
's
answer
;
``
I
said
--
be
on
your
guard
when
*NL*
you
go
near
her
.
Besides
,
you
might
have
waited
till
to-morrow
,
and
had
*NL*
me
with
you
:
it
was
mere
folly
to
attempt
the
interview
to-night
,
and
*NL*
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
I
could
have
done
some
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
thought
!
you
thought
!
Yes
,
it
makes
me
impatient
to
hear
you

but
,
*NL*
however
,
you
have
suffered
,
and
are
likely
to
suffer
enough
for
not
*NL*
taking
my
advice
;
so
I
'll
say
no
more
.
Carter
--
hurry
!
--
hurry
!
The
sun
*NL*
will
soon
rise
,
and
I
must
have
him
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Directly
,
sir
;
the
shoulder
is
just
bandaged
.
I
must
look
to
this
other
*NL*
wound
in
the
arm
:
she
has
had
her
teeth
here
too
,
I
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
sucked
the
blood
:
she
said
she
'd
drain
my
heart

said
Mason

*NL*
*NL*
I
saw
Mr.
Rochester
shudder
:
a
singularly
marked
expression
of
disgust
,
*NL*
horror
,
hatred
,
warped
his
countenance
almost
to
distortion
;
but
he
only
*NL*
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
be
silent
,
Richard

never
mind
her
gibberish

do
n't
repeat

it

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
I
could
forget
it

was
the
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
when
you
are
out
of

country

when
you
get
back

think
of

as
dead

rather

*NL*
*NL*
``
Impossible

two

-LRB-
he
turned
to
me
for
the
first
time
since
his
re-entrance
-RRB-
,
*NL*
``
take
this
key
:
go
down
into

walk
straight
forward

my
dressing-room

the
top
drawer

out

bring
them
here

nimble

*NL*
*NL*
I
went
;
sought
the
repository
he
had
mentioned
,
found
the
articles
named
,
*NL*
and
returned
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now

said
he
,

I
retired
as
directed

*NL*
``
Was

inquired
Mr.

Rochester
presently

*NL*
``
No

all
was
very
still

*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
get
you
off
cannily

it
will
be
better

both
for
your

and
for
that
of
the
poor
creature
in
yonder
.
I
have
striven
long
*NL*
to
avoid
exposure

I
should
not

come
at

him
on

run
down

the
one

next
mine

will
see
there

*NL*
*NL*
Again
I
ran
,

again
returned
,
bearing
an
immense
mantle
lined
and
*NL*
edged
with
fur
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
I
've
another
errand
for
you

said
my
untiring
master
;
``
you
must
*NL*
away
to
my
room
again

What
a

you
are
shod
with
velvet

Jane

--
a
*NL*
clod-hopping
messenger
would
never
do
at
this
juncture
.
You
must
open
*NL*
the
middle
drawer
of
my
toilet-table
and
take
out
a
little
phial
and
a
*NL*
little
glass
you
will
find
there
,

quick
!

*NL*
*NL*
I
flew
thither
and
back
,
bringing
the
desired
vessels
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
well
!
Now
,
doctor
,
I
shall
take
the
liberty
of
administering
a
*NL*
dose
myself
,
on
my
own
responsibility
.
I
got
this
cordial
at
Rome
,
of
an
*NL*
Italian
charlatan
--
a
fellow
you
would
have
kicked
,
Carter
.
It
is
not
a
*NL*
thing
to
be
used
indiscriminately
,
but
it
is
good
upon
occasion
:
as
now
,
*NL*
for
instance
.
Jane
,
a
little
water
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
held
out
the
tiny
glass
,
and
I
half
filled
it
from
the
water-bottle
on
*NL*
the
washstand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
do
;
--
now
wet
the
lip
of
the
phial
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
so
;
he
measured
twelve
drops
of
a
crimson
liquid
,
and
presented
it
*NL*
to
Mason
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Drink
,
Richard
:
it
will
give
you
the
heart
you
lack
,
for
an
hour
or
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
will
it
hurt
me

is
it
inflammatory
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Drink
!
drink
!
drink
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Mason
obeyed
,
because
it
was
evidently
useless
to
resist
.
He
was
*NL*
dressed
now
:
he
still
looked
pale
,
but
he
was
no
longer
gory
and
sullied
.
*NL*
Mr.
Rochester
let
him
sit
three
minutes
after
he
had
swallowed
the
*NL*
liquid
;
he
then
took
his
arm
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
I
am
sure
you
can
get
on
your
feet
,
''
he
said
--
``
try
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
patient
rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Carter

take
him
under
the
other
shoulder

Be
of
good
cheer

Richard

out

's
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
feel
better

remarked
Mr.
Mason
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
you
do

Now

Jane

on
before
us
away
to
the
backstairs

unbolt
the
side-passage
door

and
tell
the
driver

the
post-chaise

will
see
in

yard

just
outside

told
him

rattling
wheels
over
the
pavement

be
ready

are
coming

any

is
about

come

the
foot
of

stairs

hem

*NL*
*NL*
It
was
by
this
time
half-past
five
,
and
the
sun
was
on
the
point
of
*NL*
rising
;
but
I
found
the
kitchen
still
dark
and
silent
.
The
side-passage
*NL*
door
was
fastened
;
I
opened
it
with
as
little
noise
as
possible
:
all
the
*NL*
yard
was
quiet
;
but
the
gates
stood
wide
open
,
and
there
was
a
*NL*
post-chaise
,
with
horses
ready
harnessed
,
and
driver
seated
on
the
box
,
*NL*
stationed
outside
.
I
approached
him
,
and
said
the
gentlemen
were
coming
;
*NL*
he
nodded
:
then
I
looked
carefully
round
and
listened
.
The
stillness
of
*NL*
early
morning
slumbered
everywhere
;
the
curtains
were
yet
drawn
over
the
*NL*
servants
'
chamber
windows
;
little
birds
were
just
twittering
in
the
*NL*
blossom-blanched
orchard
trees
,
whose
boughs
drooped
like
white
garlands
*NL*
over
the
wall
enclosing
one
side
of
the
yard
;
the
carriage
horses
stamped
*NL*
from
time
to
time
in
their
closed
stables
:
all
else
was
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gentlemen
now
appeared
.
Mason
,
supported
by
Mr.
Rochester
and
the
*NL*
surgeon
,
seemed
to
walk
with
tolerable
ease
:
they
assisted
him
into
the
*NL*
chaise
;
Carter
followed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
care
of
him
,
''
said
Mr.
Rochester
to
the
latter
,
``
and
keep
him
at
*NL*
your
house
till
he
is
quite
well
:
I
shall
ride
over
in
a
day
or
two
to
*NL*
see
how
he
gets
on
.
Richard
,
how
is
it
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
fresh
air
revives
me

Fairfax

*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
the
window
open
on
his
side

is
no

good-bye

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fairfax
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
what
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
her
be
taken
care
of
;
let
her
be
treated
as
tenderly
as
may
be
:
let
*NL*
her

''
he
stopped
and
burst
into
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
my
best
;
and
have
done
it
,
and
will
do
it
,
''
was
the
answer
:
he
shut
*NL*
up
the
chaise
door
,
and
the
vehicle
drove
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
would
to
God
there
was
an
end
of
all
this
!
''
added
Mr.
Rochester
,
as
*NL*
he
closed
and
barred
the
heavy
yard-gates
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
done
,
he
moved
with
slow
step
and
abstracted
air
towards
a
door
in
*NL*
the
wall
bordering
the
orchard
.
I
,
supposing
he
had
done
with
me
,
*NL*
prepared
to
return
to
the
house
;
again
,
however
,
I
heard
him
call
``
Jane
!
''
*NL*
He
had
opened
the
portal
and
stood
at
it
,
waiting
for
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
where
there
is
some
freshness
,
for
a
few
moments
,
''
he
said
;
``
that
*NL*
house
is
a
mere
dungeon
:
do
n't
you
feel
it
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
to
me
a
splendid
mansion
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
glamour
of
inexperience
is
over
your
eyes
,
''
he
answered
;
``
and
you
*NL*
see
it
through
a
charmed
medium
:
you
can
not
discern
that
the
gilding
is
*NL*
slime
and
the
silk
draperies
cobwebs
;
that
the
marble
is
sordid
slate
,
*NL*
and
the
polished
woods
mere
refuse
chips
and
scaly
bark
.
Now
_
here
_
''
-LRB-
he
*NL*
pointed
to
the
leafy
enclosure
we
had
entered
-RRB-
``
all
is
real
,
sweet
,
and
*NL*
pure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
strayed
down
a
walk
edged
with
box
,
with
apple
trees
,
pear
trees
,
and
*NL*
cherry
trees
on
one
side
,
and
a
border
on
the
other
full
of
all
sorts
of
*NL*
old-fashioned
flowers
,
stocks
,
sweet-williams
,
primroses
,
pansies
,
*NL*
mingled
with
southernwood
,
sweet-briar
,
and
various
fragrant
herbs
.
They
*NL*
were
fresh
now
as
a
succession
of
April
showers
and
gleams
,
followed
by
a
*NL*
lovely
spring
morning
,
could
make
them
:
the
sun
was
just
entering
the
*NL*
dappled
east
,
and
his
light
illumined
the
wreathed
and
dewy
orchard
trees
*NL*
and
shone
down
the
quiet
walks
under
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jane
,
will
you
have
a
flower
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
gathered
a
half-blown
rose
,
the
first
on
the
bush
,
and
offered
it
to
*NL*
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
like
this
sunrise

high

clouds

melt
away

fastened

near

crack

He
laughed

yet
I
dare
not
show
you
where
I
am
*NL*
vulnerable
,
lest
,
faithful
and
friendly
as
you
are
,
you
should
transfix
*NL*
me
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
have
no
more
to
fear
from
Mr.
Mason
than
you
have
from
me

*NL*
you
are
very
safe

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
grant
it
may
be
so

Here
,
Jane
,
is
an
arbour
;
sit
down

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
arbour
was
an
arch
in
the
wall
,
lined
with
ivy
;
it
contained
a
rustic
*NL*
seat
.
Mr.
Rochester
took
it
,
leaving
room
,
however
,
for
me
:
but
I
stood
*NL*
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sit
,
''
he
said
;
``
the
bench
is
long
enough
for
two
.
You
do
n't
hesitate
to
*NL*
take
a
place
at
my
side
,
do
you
?
Is
that
wrong
,
Jane
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
answered
him
by
assuming
it
:
to
refuse
would
,
I
felt
,
have
been
unwise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
my
little
friend
,
while
the
sun
drinks
the
dew
--
while
all
the
*NL*
flowers
in
this
old
garden
awake
and
expand
,
and
the
birds
fetch
their
*NL*
young
ones
'
breakfast
out
of
the
Thornfield
,
and
the
early
bees
do
their
*NL*
first
spell
of
work
--
I
'll
put
a
case
to
you
,
which
you
must
endeavour
to
*NL*
suppose
your
own
:
but
first
,
look
at
me
,
and
tell
me
you
are
at
ease
,
and
*NL*
not
fearing
that
I
err
in
detaining
you
,
or
that
you
err
in
staying
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
;
I
am
content
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
Jane
,
call
to
aid
your
fancy
:
--
suppose
you
were
no
longer
a
*NL*
girl
well
reared
and
disciplined
,
but
a
wild
boy
indulged
from
childhood
*NL*
upwards
;
imagine
yourself
in
a
remote
foreign
land
;
conceive
that
you
*NL*
there
commit
a
capital
error
,
no
matter
of
what
nature
or
from
what
*NL*
motives
,
but
one
whose
consequences
must
follow
you
through
life
and
*NL*
taint
all
your
existence
.
Mind
,
I
do
n't
say
a
_
crime
_
;
I
am
not
speaking
*NL*
of
shedding
of
blood
or
any
other
guilty
act
,
which
might
make
the
*NL*
perpetrator
amenable
to
the
law
:
my
word
is
_
error
_
.
The
results
of
what
*NL*
you
have
done
become
in
time
to
you
utterly
insupportable
;
you
take
*NL*
measures
to
obtain
relief
:
unusual
measures
,
but
neither
unlawful
nor
*NL*
culpable
.
Still
you
are
miserable
;
for
hope
has
quitted
you
on
the
very
*NL*
confines
of
life
:
your
sun
at
noon
darkens
in
an
eclipse
,
which
you
feel
*NL*
will
not
leave
it
till
the
time
of
setting
.
Bitter
and
base
associations
*NL*
have
become
the
sole
food
of
your
memory
:
you
wander
here
and
there
,
*NL*
seeking
rest
in
exile
:
happiness
in
pleasure
--
I
mean
in
heartless
,
*NL*
sensual
pleasure
--
such
as
dulls
intellect
and
blights
feeling
.
*NL*
Heart-weary
and
soul-withered
,
you
come
home
after
years
of
voluntary
*NL*
banishment
:
you
make
a
new
acquaintance
--
how
or
where
no
matter
:
you
find
*NL*
in
this
stranger
much
of
the
good
and
bright
qualities
which
you
have
*NL*
sought
for
twenty
years
,
and
never
before
encountered
;
and
they
are
all
*NL*
fresh
,
healthy
,
without
soil
and
without
taint
.
Such
society
revives
,
*NL*
regenerates
:
you
feel
better
days
come
back
--
higher
wishes
,
purer
*NL*
feelings
;
you
desire
to
recommence
your
life
,
and
to
spend
what
remains
*NL*
to
you
of
days
in
a
way
more
worthy
of
an
immortal
being
.
To
attain
this
*NL*
end
,
are
you
justified
in
overleaping
an
obstacle
of
custom
--
a
mere
*NL*
conventional
impediment
which
neither
your
conscience
sanctifies
nor
your
*NL*
judgment
approves
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
for
an
answer
:
and
what
was
I
to
say
?
Oh
,
for
some
good
spirit
*NL*
to
suggest
a
judicious
and
satisfactory
response
!
Vain
aspiration
!
The
*NL*
west
wind
whispered
in
the
ivy
round
me
;
but
no
gentle
Ariel
borrowed
its
*NL*
breath
as
a
medium
of
speech
:
the
birds
sang
in
the
tree-tops
;
but
their
*NL*
song
,
however
sweet
,
was
inarticulate
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
Mr.
Rochester
propounded
his
query
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
the
wandering
and
sinful
,
but
now
rest-seeking
and
repentant
,
man
*NL*
justified
in
daring
the
world
's
opinion
,
in
order
to
attach
to
him
for
*NL*
ever
this
gentle
,
gracious
,
genial
stranger
,
thereby
securing
his
own
*NL*
peace
of
mind
and
regeneration
of
life
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
I
answered
,
``
a
wanderer
's
repose
or
a
sinner
's
reformation
should
*NL*
never
depend
on
a
fellow-creature
.
Men
and
women
die
;
philosophers
*NL*
falter
in
wisdom
,
and
Christians
in
goodness
:
if
any
one
you
know
has
*NL*
suffered
and
erred
,
let
him
look
higher
than
his
equals
for
strength
to
*NL*
amend
and
solace
to
heal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
instrument
--
the
instrument
!
God
,
who
does
the
work
,
ordains
the
*NL*
instrument

I
have
myself
--
I
tell
it
you
without
parable
--
been
a
*NL*
worldly
,
dissipated
,
restless
man
;
and
I
believe
I
have
found
the
*NL*
instrument
for
my
cure
in

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
:
the
birds
went
on
carolling
,
the
leaves
lightly
rustling
.
I
*NL*
almost
wondered
they
did
not
check
their
songs
and
whispers
to
catch
the
*NL*
suspended
revelation
;
but
they
would
have
had
to
wait
many
minutes
--
so
*NL*
long
was
the
silence
protracted
.
At
last
I
looked
up
at
the
tardy
*NL*
speaker
:
he
was
looking
eagerly
at
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Little
friend
,
''
said
he
,
in
quite
a
changed
tone
--
while
his
face
changed
*NL*
too
,
losing
all
its
softness
and
gravity
,
and
becoming
harsh
and
*NL*
sarcastic
--
``
you
have
noticed
my
tender
penchant
for
Miss
Ingram
:
do
n't
*NL*
you
think
if
I
married
her
she
would
regenerate
me
with
a
vengeance
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
got
up
instantly
,
went
quite
to
the
other
end
of
the
walk
,
and
when
he
*NL*
came
back
he
was
humming
a
tune
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jane

Jane

''
said
he
,
stopping
before
me
,
``
you
are
quite
pale
with
your
*NL*
vigils

*NL*
*NL*
``
Curse

No

*NL*
*NL*
``
Shake

them
at
the
door

chamber

As
I
went
one
way
,
he
went
another
,
and
I
heard
him
in
the
yard
,
saying
*NL*
cheerfully
--

CHAPTER
XXI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Presentiments
are
strange
things
!
and
so
are
sympathies
;
and
so
are
*NL*
signs
;
and
the
three
combined
make
one
mystery
to
which
humanity
has
not
*NL*
yet
found
the
key
.
I
never
laughed
at
presentiments
in
my
life
,
because
*NL*
I
have
had
strange
ones
of
my
own
.
Sympathies
,
I
believe
,
exist
-LRB-
for
*NL*
instance
,
between
far-distant
,
long-absent
,
wholly
estranged
relatives
*NL*
asserting
,
notwithstanding
their
alienation
,
the
unity
of
the
source
to
*NL*
which
each
traces
his
origin
-RRB-
whose
workings
baffle
mortal
comprehension
.
*NL*
And
signs
,
for
aught
we
know
,
may
be
but
the
sympathies
of
Nature
with
*NL*
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
was
a
little
girl
,
only
six
years
old
,
I
one
night
heard
Bessie
*NL*
Leaven
say
to
Martha
Abbot
that
she
had
been
dreaming
about
a
little
*NL*
child
;
and
that
to
dream
of
children
was
a
sure
sign
of
trouble
,
either
*NL*
to
one
's
self
or
one
's
kin
.
The
saying
might
have
worn
out
of
my
memory
,
*NL*
had
not
a
circumstance
immediately
followed
which
served
indelibly
to
fix
*NL*
it
there
.
The
next
day
Bessie
was
sent
for
home
to
the
deathbed
of
her
*NL*
little
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
late
I
had
often
recalled
this
saying
and
this
incident
;
for
during
*NL*
the
past
week
scarcely
a
night
had
gone
over
my
couch
that
had
not
*NL*
brought
with
it
a
dream
of
an
infant
,
which
I
sometimes
hushed
in
my
*NL*
arms
,
sometimes
dandled
on
my
knee
,
sometimes
watched
playing
with
*NL*
daisies
on
a
lawn
,
or
again
,
dabbling
its
hands
in
running
water
.
It
was
*NL*
a
wailing
child
this
night
,
and
a
laughing
one
the
next
:
now
it
nestled
*NL*
close
to
me
,
and
now
it
ran
from
me
;
but
whatever
mood
the
apparition
*NL*
evinced
,
whatever
aspect
it
wore
,
it
failed
not
for
seven
successive
*NL*
nights
to
meet
me
the
moment
I
entered
the
land
of
slumber
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
not
like
this
iteration
of
one
idea
--
this
strange
recurrence
of
one
*NL*
image
,
and
I
grew
nervous
as
bedtime
approached
and
the
hour
of
the
*NL*
vision
drew
near
.
It
was
from
companionship
with
this
baby-phantom
I
had
*NL*
been
roused
on
that
moonlight
night
when
I
heard
the
cry
;
and
it
was
on
*NL*
the
afternoon
of
the
day
following
I
was
summoned
downstairs
by
a
message
*NL*
that
some
one
wanted
me
in
Mrs.
Fairfax
's
room
.
On
repairing
thither
,
I
*NL*
found
a
man
waiting
for
me
,
having
the
appearance
of
a
gentleman
's
*NL*
servant
:
he
was
dressed
in
deep
mourning
,
and
the
hat
he
held
in
his
hand
*NL*
was
surrounded
with
a
crape
band
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
daresay
you
hardly
remember
me
,
Miss
,
''
he
said
,
rising
as
I
entered
;
*NL*
``
but
my
name
is
Leaven
:
I
lived
coachman
with
Mrs.
Reed
when
you
were
at
*NL*
Gateshead
,
eight
or
nine
years
since
,
and
I
live
there
still
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Robert
!
how
do
you
do
?
I
remember
you
very
well
:
you
used
to
give
*NL*
me
a
ride
sometimes
on
Miss
Georgiana
's
bay
pony
.
And
how
is
Bessie
?
You
*NL*
are
married
to
Bessie
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Miss
:
my
wife
is
very
hearty
,
thank
you
;
she
brought
me
another
*NL*
little
one
about
two
months
since
--
we
have
three
now
--
and
both
mother
and
*NL*
child
are
thriving
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
are
the
family
well
at
the
house

Robert
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
I
ca
n't
give
you
better
news
of
them

:

are
very
*NL*
badly
at
present
--
in
great
trouble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
no
one
is
dead
,
''
I
said
,
glancing
at
his
black
dress
.
He
too
*NL*
looked
down
at
the
crape
round
his
hat
and
replied
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
John
died
yesterday
was
a
week
,
at
his
chambers
in
London
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
John
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
does
his
mother
bear
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
see
,
Miss
Eyre
,
it
is
not
a
common
mishap
:
his
life
has
been
*NL*
very
wild
:
these
last
three
years
he
gave
himself
up
to
strange
ways
,
and
*NL*
his
death
was
shocking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
heard
from
Bessie
he
was
not
doing
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doing
well
!
He
could
not
do
worse
:
he
ruined
his
health
and
his
estate
*NL*
amongst
the
worst
men
and
the
worst
women
.
He
got
into
debt
and
into
*NL*
jail
:
his
mother
helped
him
out
twice
,
but
as
soon
as
he
was
free
he
*NL*
returned
to
his
old
companions
and
habits
.
His
head
was
not
strong
:
the
*NL*
knaves
he
lived
amongst
fooled
him
beyond
anything
I
ever
heard
.
He
came
*NL*
down
to
Gateshead
about
three
weeks
ago
and
wanted
missis
to
give
up
all
*NL*
to
him
.
Missis
refused
:
her
means
have
long
been
much
reduced
by
his
*NL*
extravagance
;
so
he
went
back
again
,
and
the
next
news
was
that
he
was
*NL*
dead
.
How
he
died
,
God
knows
!
--
they
say
he
killed
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
silent
:
the
things
were
frightful
.
Robert
Leaven
resumed
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Missis
had
been
out
of
health
herself
for
some
time
:
she
had
got
very
*NL*
stout
,
but
was
not
strong
with
it
;
and
the
loss
of
money
and
fear
of
*NL*
poverty
were
quite
breaking
her
down
.
The
information
about
Mr.
John
's
*NL*
death
and
the
manner
of
it
came
too
suddenly
:
it
brought
on
a
stroke
.
She
*NL*
was
three
days
without
speaking
;
but
last
Tuesday
she
seemed
rather
*NL*
better
:
she
appeared
as
if
she
wanted
to
say
something
,
and
kept
making
*NL*
signs
to
my
wife
and
mumbling
.
It
was
only
yesterday
morning
,
however
,
*NL*
that
Bessie
understood
she
was
pronouncing
your
name
;
and
at
last
she
*NL*
made
out
the
words
,
`
Bring
Jane
--
fetch
Jane
Eyre
:
I
want
to
speak
to
*NL*
her
.
'
Bessie
is
not
sure
whether
she
is
in
her
right
mind
,
or
means
*NL*
anything
by
the
words
;
but
she
told
Miss
Reed
and
Miss
Georgiana
,
and
*NL*
advised
them
to
send
for
you
.
The
young
ladies
put
it
off
at
first
;
but
*NL*
their
mother
grew
so
restless
,
and
said
,
`
Jane
,
Jane
,
'
so
many
times
,
*NL*
that
at
last
they
consented
.
I
left
Gateshead
yesterday
:
and
if
you
can
*NL*
get
ready
,
Miss
,
I
should
like
to
take
you
back
with
me
early
to-morrow
*NL*
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Robert
,
I
shall
be
ready
:
it
seems
to
me
that
I
ought
to
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
so
too
,
Miss.
.
Bessie
said
she
was
sure
you
would
not
refuse
:
*NL*
but
I
suppose
you
will
have
to
ask
leave
before
you
can
get
off
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
and
I
will
do
it
now
;
''
and
having
directed
him
to
the
servants
'
*NL*
hall
,
and
recommended
him
to
the
care
of
John
's
wife
,
and
the
attentions
*NL*
of
John
himself
,
I
went
in
search
of
Mr.
Rochester
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
not
in
any
of
the
lower
rooms
;
he
was
not
in
the
yard
,
the
*NL*
stables
,
or
the
grounds
.
I
asked
Mrs.
Fairfax
if
she
had
seen
him
;
--
yes
:
*NL*
she
believed
he
was
playing
billiards
with
Miss
Ingram
.
To
the
billiard
-
*NL*
room
I
hastened
:
the
click
of
balls
and
the
hum
of
voices
resounded
*NL*
thence
;
Mr.
Rochester
,
Miss
Ingram
,
the
two
Misses
Eshton
,
and
their
*NL*
admirers
,
were
all
busied
in
the
game
.
It
required
some
courage
to
*NL*
disturb
so
interesting
a
party
;
my
errand
,
however
,
was
one
I
could
not
*NL*
defer
,
so
I
approached
the
master
where
he
stood
at
Miss
Ingram
's
side
.
*NL*
She
turned
as
I
drew
near
,
and
looked
at
me
haughtily
:
her
eyes
seemed
to
*NL*
demand
,
``
What
can
the
creeping
creature
want
now
?
''
and
when
I
said
,
in
a
*NL*
low
voice
,
``
Mr.
Rochester
,
''
she
made
a
movement
as
if
tempted
to
order
me
*NL*
away
.
I
remember
her
appearance
at
the
moment
--
it
was
very
graceful
and
*NL*
very
striking
:
she
wore
a
morning
robe
of
sky-blue
crape
;
a
gauzy
azure
*NL*
scarf
was
twisted
in
her
hair
.
She
had
been
all
animation
with
the
game
,
*NL*
and
irritated
pride
did
not
lower
the
expression
of
her
haughty
*NL*
lineaments
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
that
person
want
you
?
''
she
inquired
of
Mr.
Rochester
;
and
Mr.
*NL*
Rochester
turned
to
see
who
the
``
person
''
was
.
He
made
a
curious
*NL*
grimace
--
one
of
his
strange
and
equivocal
demonstrations
--
threw
down
his
*NL*
cue
and
followed
me
from
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Jane
?
''
he
said
,
as
he
rested
his
back
against
the
schoolroom
door
,
*NL*
which
he
had
shut
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
please
,
sir
,
I
want
leave
of
absence
for
a
week
or
two
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
to
do
?
--
where
to
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
see
a
sick
lady
who
has
sent
for
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
sick
lady

where
does
she
live

*NL*
*NL*
``
At
Gateshead

That
is
a
hundred
miles
off
!

may
she
be

for
*NL*
people
to
see
her
that
distance
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
name
is
Reed

Mrs.
Reed

*NL*
*NL*

was
a

is

How
do
you
know
her

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
None

Sir
George

was
*NL*
talking
of

Gateshead
yesterday
,
who
,
he
said
,
was
one
of
the
*NL*
veriest
rascals
on
town

Ingram
was
mentioning
a
Georgiana

was
much
admired

a

you
in

he
asked

smiling

*NL*
*NL*
I
drew
out
my
purse
;
a
meagre
thing
it
was
.
``
Five
shillings

He
*NL*
took
the
purse
,
poured
the
hoard
into
his
palm
,
and
chuckled
over
it
as
*NL*
if
its
scantiness
amused
him
.
Soon
he
produced
his
pocket-book
:
``
Here
,
''
*NL*
said
he
,
offering
me
a
note
;
it
was
fifty
pounds
,
and
he
owed
me
but
*NL*
fifteen

I
told
him
I
had
no
change

*NL*
``
I

*NL*
*NL*
I
declined
accepting
more
than
was
my
due

He
scowled
at
first
;
then
,
as

if
recollecting
something
,
he
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Right

right

distortion

features
equally
fantastic

ludicrous

looked

some
minutes

burnt

played
quietly
in
a
corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bless
you
!
--
I
knew
you
would
come
!
''
exclaimed
Mrs.
Leaven
,
as
I
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Bessie
,
''
said
I
,
after
I
had
kissed
her
;
``
and
I
trust
I
am
not
too
*NL*
late
.
How
is
Mrs.
Reed
?
--
Alive
still
,
I
hope
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
she
is
alive
;
and
more
sensible
and
collected
than
she
was
.
The
*NL*
doctor
says
she
may
linger
a
week
or
two
yet
;
but
he
hardly
thinks
she
*NL*
will
finally
recover
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
she
mentioned
me
lately
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
was
talking
of
you
only
this
morning
,
and
wishing
you
would
come
,
*NL*
but
she
is
sleeping
now
,
or
was
ten
minutes
ago
,
when
I
was
up
at
the
*NL*
house
.
She
generally
lies
in
a
kind
of
lethargy
all
the
afternoon
,
and
*NL*
wakes
up
about
six
or
seven
.
Will
you
rest
yourself
here
an
hour
,
Miss
,
*NL*
and
then
I
will
go
up
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Robert
here
entered
,
and
Bessie
laid
her
sleeping
child
in
the
cradle
and
*NL*
went
to
welcome
him
:
afterwards
she
insisted
on
my
taking
off
my
bonnet
*NL*
and
having
some
tea
;
for
she
said
I
looked
pale
and
tired
.
I
was
glad
to
*NL*
accept
her
hospitality
;
and
I
submitted
to
be
relieved
of
my
travelling
*NL*
garb
just
as
passively
as
I
used
to
let
her
undress
me
when
a
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
Old
times
crowded
fast
back
on
me
as
I
watched
her
bustling
about
--
setting
*NL*
out
the
tea-tray
with
her
best
china
,
cutting
bread
and
butter
,
toasting
*NL*
a
tea-cake
,
and
,
between
whiles
,
giving
little
Robert
or
Jane
an
*NL*
occasional
tap
or
push
,
just
as
she
used
to
give
me
in
former
days
.
*NL*
Bessie
had
retained
her
quick
temper
as
well
as
her
light
foot
and
good
*NL*
looks
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tea
ready
,
I
was
going
to
approach
the
table
;
but
she
desired
me
to
sit
*NL*
still
,
quite
in
her
old
peremptory
tones
.
I
must
be
served
at
the
*NL*
fireside
,
she
said
;
and
she
placed
before
me
a
little
round
stand
with
my
*NL*
cup
and
a
plate
of
toast
,
absolutely
as
she
used
to
accommodate
me
with
*NL*
some
privately
purloined
dainty
on
a
nursery
chair
:
and
I
smiled
and
*NL*
obeyed
her
as
in
bygone
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
wanted
to
know
if
I
was
happy
at
Thornfield
Hall
,
and
what
sort
of
a
*NL*
person
the
mistress
was
;
and
when
I
told
her
there
was
only
a
master
,
*NL*
whether
he
was
a
nice
gentleman
,
and
if
I
liked
him
.
I
told
her
he
was
*NL*
rather
an
ugly
man
,
but
quite
a
gentleman
;
and
that
he
treated
me
kindly
,
*NL*
and
I
was
content
.
Then
I
went
on
to
describe
to
her
the
gay
company
*NL*
that
had
lately
been
staying
at
the
house
;
and
to
these
details
Bessie
*NL*
listened
with
interest
:
they
were
precisely
of
the
kind
she
relished
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
such
conversation
an
hour
was
soon
gone
:
Bessie
restored
to
me
my
*NL*
bonnet
,
&
c.
,
and
,
accompanied
by
her
,
I
quitted
the
lodge
for
the
hall
.
*NL*
It
was
also
accompanied
by
her
that
I
had
,
nearly
nine
years
ago
,
walked
*NL*
down
the
path
I
was
now
ascending
.
On
a
dark
,
misty
,
raw
morning
in
*NL*
January
,
I
had
left
a
hostile
roof
with
a
desperate
and
embittered
*NL*
heart
--
a
sense
of
outlawry
and
almost
of
reprobation
--
to
seek
the
chilly
*NL*
harbourage
of
Lowood
:
that
bourne
so
far
away
and
unexplored
.
The
same
*NL*
hostile
roof
now
again
rose
before
me
:
my
prospects
were
doubtful
yet
;
*NL*
and
I
had
yet
an
aching
heart
.
I
still
felt
as
a
wanderer
on
the
face
of
*NL*
the
earth
;
but
I
experienced
firmer
trust
in
myself
and
my
own
powers
,
*NL*
and
less
withering
dread
of
oppression
.
The
gaping
wound
of
my
wrongs
,
*NL*
too
,
was
now
quite
healed
;
and
the
flame
of
resentment
extinguished
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
shall
go
into
the
breakfast-room
first
,
''
said
Bessie
,
as
she
*NL*
preceded
me
through
the
hall
;
``
the
young
ladies
will
be
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
another
moment
I
was
within
that
apartment
.
There
was
every
article
*NL*
of
furniture
looking
just
as
it
did
on
the
morning
I
was
first
introduced
*NL*
to
Mr.
Brocklehurst
:
the
very
rug
he
had
stood
upon
still
covered
the
*NL*
hearth
.
Glancing
at
the
bookcases
,
I
thought
I
could
distinguish
the
two
*NL*
volumes
of
Bewick
's
British
Birds
occupying
their
old
place
on
the
third
*NL*
shelf
,
and
Gulliver
's
Travels
and
the
Arabian
Nights
ranged
just
above
.
*NL*
The
inanimate
objects
were
not
changed
;
but
the
living
things
had
altered
*NL*
past
recognition
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
young
ladies
appeared
before
me
;
one
very
tall
,
almost
as
tall
as
*NL*
Miss
Ingram
--
very
thin
too
,
with
a
sallow
face
and
severe
mien
.
There
*NL*
was
something
ascetic
in
her
look
,
which
was
augmented
by
the
extreme
*NL*
plainness
of
a
straight-skirted
,
black
,
stuff
dress
,
a
starched
linen
*NL*
collar
,
hair
combed
away
from
the
temples
,
and
the
nun-like
ornament
of
a
*NL*
string
of
ebony
beads
and
a
crucifix
.
This
I
felt
sure
was
Eliza
,
though
*NL*
I
could
trace
little
resemblance
to
her
former
self
in
that
elongated
and
*NL*
colourless
visage
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
was
as
certainly
Georgiana
:
but
not
the
Georgiana
I
*NL*
remembered
--
the
slim
and
fairy-like
girl
of
eleven
.
This
was
a
*NL*
full-blown
,
very
plump
damsel
,
fair
as
waxwork
,
with
handsome
and
regular
*NL*
features
,
languishing
blue
eyes
,
and
ringleted
yellow
hair
.
The
hue
of
*NL*
her
dress
was
black
too
;
but
its
fashion
was
so
different
from
her
*NL*
sister
's
--
so
much
more
flowing
and
becoming
--
it
looked
as
stylish
as
the
*NL*
other
's
looked
puritanical
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
each
of
the
sisters
there
was
one
trait
of
the
mother
--
and
only
one
;
*NL*
the
thin
and
pallid
elder
daughter
had
her
parent
's
Cairngorm
eye
:
the
*NL*
blooming
and
luxuriant
younger
girl
had
her
contour
of
jaw
and
*NL*
chin
--
perhaps
a
little
softened
,
but
still
imparting
an
indescribable
*NL*
hardness
to
the
countenance
otherwise
so
voluptuous
and
buxom
.
*NL*
*NL*
Both
ladies
,
as
I
advanced
,
rose
to
welcome
me
,
and
both
addressed
me
by
*NL*
the
name
of
``
Miss
Eyre
.
''
Eliza
's
greeting
was
delivered
in
a
short
,
*NL*
abrupt
voice
,
without
a
smile
;
and
then
she
sat
down
again
,
fixed
her
*NL*
eyes
on
the
fire
,
and
seemed
to
forget
me
.
Georgiana
added
to
her
``
How
*NL*
d'ye
do
?
''
several
commonplaces
about
my
journey
,
the
weather
,
and
so
on
,
*NL*
uttered
in
rather
a
drawling
tone
:
and
accompanied
by
sundry
side-glances
*NL*
that
measured
me
from
head
to
foot
--
now
traversing
the
folds
of
my
drab
*NL*
merino
pelisse
,
and
now
lingering
on
the
plain
trimming
of
my
cottage
*NL*
bonnet
.
Young
ladies
have
a
remarkable
way
of
letting
you
know
that
they
*NL*
think
you
a
``
quiz
''
without
actually
saying
the
words
.
A
certain
*NL*
superciliousness
of
look
,
coolness
of
manner
,
nonchalance
of
tone
,
*NL*
express
fully
their
sentiments
on
the
point
,
without
committing
them
by
*NL*
any
positive
rudeness
in
word
or
deed
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
sneer
,
however
,
whether
covert
or
open
,
had
now
no
longer
that
power
*NL*
over
me
it
once
possessed
:
as
I
sat
between
my
cousins
,
I
was
surprised
*NL*
to
find
how
easy
I
felt
under
the
total
neglect
of
the
one
and
the
semi
-
*NL*
sarcastic
attentions
of
the
other
--
Eliza
did
not
mortify
,
nor
Georgiana
*NL*
ruffle
me
.
The
fact
was
,
I
had
other
things
to
think
about
;
within
the
*NL*
last
few
months
feelings
had
been
stirred
in
me
so
much
more
potent
than
*NL*
any
they
could
raise
--
pains
and
pleasures
so
much
more
acute
and
*NL*
exquisite
had
been
excited
than
any
it
was
in
their
power
to
inflict
or
*NL*
bestow
--
that
their
airs
gave
me
no
concern
either
for
good
or
bad
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
Mrs.
Reed
?
''
I
asked
soon
,
looking
calmly
at
Georgiana
,
who
*NL*
thought
fit
to
bridle
at
the
direct
address
,
as
if
it
were
an
unexpected
*NL*
liberty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Reed
?
Ah
!
mama
,
you
mean
;
she
is
extremely
poorly
:
I
doubt
if
you
*NL*
can
see
her
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
,
''
said
I
,
``
you
would
just
step
upstairs
and
tell
her
I
am
come
,
I
*NL*
should
be
much
obliged
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Georgiana
almost
started
,
and
she
opened
her
blue
eyes
wild
and
wide
.
``
I
*NL*
know
she
had
a
particular
wish
to
see
me
,
''
I
added
,
``
and
I
would
not
*NL*
defer
attending
to
her
desire
longer
than
is
absolutely
necessary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mama
dislikes
being
disturbed
in
an
evening
,
''
remarked
Eliza
.
I
soon
*NL*
rose
,
quietly
took
off
my
bonnet
and
gloves
,
uninvited
,
and
said
I
would
*NL*
just
step
out
to
Bessie
--
who
was
,
I
dared
say
,
in
the
kitchen
--
and
ask
*NL*
her
to
ascertain
whether
Mrs.
Reed
was
disposed
to
receive
me
or
not
to
-
*NL*
night
.
I
went
,
and
having
found
Bessie
and
despatched
her
on
my
errand
,
*NL*
I
proceeded
to
take
further
measures
.
It
had
heretofore
been
my
habit
*NL*
always
to
shrink
from
arrogance
:
received
as
I
had
been
to-day
,
I
should
,
*NL*
a
year
ago
,
have
resolved
to
quit
Gateshead
the
very
next
morning
;
now
,
*NL*
it
was
disclosed
to
me
all
at
once
that
that
would
be
a
foolish
plan
.
I
*NL*
had
taken
a
journey
of
a
hundred
miles
to
see
my
aunt
,
and
I
must
stay
*NL*
with
her
till
she
was
better
--
or
dead
:
as
to
her
daughters
'
pride
or
*NL*
folly
,
I
must
put
it
on
one
side
,
make
myself
independent
of
it
.
So
I
*NL*
addressed
the
housekeeper
;
asked
her
to
show
me
a
room
,
told
her
I
should
*NL*
probably
be
a
visitor
here
for
a
week
or
two
,
had
my
trunk
conveyed
to
my
*NL*
chamber
,
and
followed
it
thither
myself
:
I
met
Bessie
on
the
landing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Missis
is
awake
,
''
said
she
;
``
I
have
told
her
you
are
here
:
come
and
let
*NL*
us
see
if
she
will
know
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
not
need
to
be
guided
to
the
well-known
room
,
to
which
I
had
so
*NL*
often
been
summoned
for
chastisement
or
reprimand
in
former
days
.
I
*NL*
hastened
before
Bessie
;
I
softly
opened
the
door
:
a
shaded
light
stood
on
*NL*
the
table
,
for
it
was
now
getting
dark
.
There
was
the
great
four-post
*NL*
bed
with
amber
hangings
as
of
old
;
there
the
toilet-table
,
the
armchair
,
*NL*
and
the
footstool
,
at
which
I
had
a
hundred
times
been
sentenced
to
*NL*
kneel
,
to
ask
pardon
for
offences
by
me
uncommitted
.
I
looked
into
a
*NL*
certain
corner
near
,
half-expecting
to
see
the
slim
outline
of
a
once
*NL*
dreaded
switch
which
used
to
lurk
there
,
waiting
to
leap
out
imp-like
and
*NL*
lace
my
quivering
palm
or
shrinking
neck
.
I
approached
the
bed
;
I
opened
*NL*
the
curtains
and
leant
over
the
high-piled
pillows
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
did
I
remember
Mrs.
Reed
's
face
,
and
I
eagerly
sought
the
familiar
*NL*
image
.
It
is
a
happy
thing
that
time
quells
the
longings
of
vengeance
*NL*
and
hushes
the
promptings
of
rage
and
aversion
.
I
had
left
this
woman
in
*NL*
bitterness
and
hate
,
and
I
came
back
to
her
now
with
no
other
emotion
*NL*
than
a
sort
of
ruth
for
her
great
sufferings
,
and
a
strong
yearning
to
*NL*
forget
and
forgive
all
injuries
--
to
be
reconciled
and
clasp
hands
in
*NL*
amity
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
well-known
face
was
there
:
stern
,
relentless
as
ever
--
there
was
that
*NL*
peculiar
eye
which
nothing
could
melt
,
and
the
somewhat
raised
,
*NL*
imperious
,
despotic
eyebrow
.
How
often
had
it
lowered
on
me
menace
and
*NL*
hate
!
and
how
the
recollection
of
childhood
's
terrors
and
sorrows
revived
*NL*
as
I
traced
its
harsh
line
now
!
And
yet
I
stooped
down
and
kissed
her
:
*NL*
she
looked
at
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
this
Jane
Eyre
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Aunt
Reed
.
How
are
you
,
dear
aunt
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
once
vowed
that
I
would
never
call
her
aunt
again
:
I
thought
it
no
*NL*
sin
to
forget
and
break
that
vow
now
.
My
fingers
had
fastened
on
her
*NL*
hand
which
lay
outside
the
sheet
:
had
she
pressed
mine
kindly
,
I
should
*NL*
at
that
moment
have
experienced
true
pleasure
.
But
unimpressionable
*NL*
natures
are
not
so
soon
softened
,
nor
are
natural
antipathies
so
readily
*NL*
eradicated
.
Mrs.
Reed
took
her
hand
away
,
and
,
turning
her
face
rather
*NL*
from
me
,
she
remarked
that
the
night
was
warm
.
Again
she
regarded
me
so
*NL*
icily
,
I
felt
at
once
that
her
opinion
of
me
--
her
feeling
towards
me
--
was
*NL*
unchanged
and
unchangeable
.
I
knew
by
her
stony
eye
--
opaque
to
*NL*
tenderness
,
indissoluble
to
tears
--
that
she
was
resolved
to
consider
me
*NL*
bad
to
the
last
;
because
to
believe
me
good
would
give
her
no
generous
*NL*
pleasure
:
only
a
sense
of
mortification
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
pain
,
and
then
I
felt
ire
;
and
then
I
felt
a
determination
to
*NL*
subdue
her
--
to
be
her
mistress
in
spite
both
of
her
nature
and
her
will
.
*NL*
My
tears
had
risen
,
just
as
in
childhood
:
I
ordered
them
back
to
their
*NL*
source
.
I
brought
a
chair
to
the
bed-head
:
I
sat
down
and
leaned
over
*NL*
the
pillow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
sent
for
me
,
''
I
said
,
``
and
I
am
here
;
and
it
is
my
intention
to
stay
*NL*
till
I
see
how
you
get
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
of
course
!
You
have
seen
my
daughters
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
may
tell
them
I
wish
you
to
stay
till
I
can
talk
some
things
*NL*
over
with
you
I
have
on
my
mind
:
to-night
it
is
too
late
,
and
I
have
a
*NL*
difficulty
in
recalling
them
.
But
there
was
something
I
wished
to
*NL*
say
--
let
me
see
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
wandering
look
and
changed
utterance
told
what
wreck
had
taken
place
*NL*
in
her
once
vigorous
frame
.
Turning
restlessly
,
she
drew
the
bedclothes
*NL*
round
her
;
my
elbow
,
resting
on
a
corner
of
the
quilt
,
fixed
it
down
:
she
*NL*
was
at
once
irritated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sit
up
!
''
said
she
;
``
do
n't
annoy
me
with
holding
the
clothes
fast
.
Are
*NL*
you
Jane
Eyre
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
Jane
Eyre
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
had
more
trouble
with
that
child
than
any
one
would
believe
.
Such
*NL*
a
burden
to
be
left
on
my
hands
--
and
so
much
annoyance
as
she
caused
me
,
*NL*
daily
and
hourly
,
with
her
incomprehensible
disposition
,
and
her
sudden
*NL*
starts
of
temper
,
and
her
continual
,
unnatural
watchings
of
one
's
*NL*
movements
!
I
declare
she
talked
to
me
once
like
something
mad
,
or
like
a
*NL*
fiend
--
no
child
ever
spoke
or
looked
as
she
did
;
I
was
glad
to
get
her
*NL*
away
from
the
house
.
What
did
they
do
with
her
at
Lowood
?
The
fever
*NL*
broke
out
there
,
and
many
of
the
pupils
died
.
She
,
however
,
did
not
die
:
*NL*
but
I
said
she
did
--
I
wish
she
had
died
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
strange
wish
,
Mrs.
Reed
;
why
do
you
hate
her
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
a
dislike
to
her
mother
always
;
for
she
was
my
husband
's
only
*NL*
sister
,
and
a
great
favourite
with
him
:
he
opposed
the
family
's
disowning
*NL*
her
when
she
made
her
low
marriage
;
and
when
news
came
of
her
death
,
he
*NL*
wept
like
a
simpleton
.
He
would
send
for
the
baby
;
though
I
entreated
*NL*
him
rather
to
put
it
out
to
nurse
and
pay
for
its
maintenance
.
I
hated
*NL*
it
the
first
time
I
set
my
eyes
on
it
--
a
sickly
,
whining
,
pining
thing
!
*NL*
It
would
wail
in
its
cradle
all
night
long
--
not
screaming
heartily
like
*NL*
any
other
child
,
but
whimpering
and
moaning
.
Reed
pitied
it
;
and
he
used
*NL*
to
nurse
it
and
notice
it
as
if
it
had
been
his
own
:
more
,
indeed
,
than
*NL*
he
ever
noticed
his
own
at
that
age
.
He
would
try
to
make
my
children
*NL*
friendly
to
the
little
beggar
:
the
darlings
could
not
bear
it
,
and
he
was
*NL*
angry
with
them
when
they
showed
their
dislike
.
In
his
last
illness
,
he
*NL*
had
it
brought
continually
to
his
bedside
;
and
but
an
hour
before
he
*NL*
died
,
he
bound
me
by
vow
to
keep
the
creature
.
I
would
as
soon
have
been
*NL*
charged
with
a
pauper
brat
out
of
a
workhouse
:
but
he
was
weak
,
naturally
*NL*
weak
.
John
does
not
at
all
resemble
his
father
,
and
I
am
glad
of
it
:
*NL*
John
is
like
me
and
like
my
brothers
--
he
is
quite
a
Gibson
.
Oh
,
I
wish
*NL*
he
would
cease
tormenting
me
with
letters
for
money
?
I
have
no
more
*NL*
money
to
give
him
:
we
are
getting
poor
.
I
must
send
away
half
the
*NL*
servants
and
shut
up
part
of
the
house
;
or
let
it
off
.
I
can
never
*NL*
submit
to
do
that
--
yet
how
are
we
to
get
on
?
Two-thirds
of
my
income
*NL*
goes
in
paying
the
interest
of
mortgages
.
John
gambles
dreadfully
,
and
*NL*
always
loses
--
poor
boy
!
He
is
beset
by
sharpers
:
John
is
sunk
and
*NL*
degraded
--
his
look
is
frightful
--
I
feel
ashamed
for
him
when
I
see
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
getting
much
excited
.
``
I
think
I
had
better
leave
her
now
,
''
said
*NL*
I
to
Bessie
,
who
stood
on
the
other
side
of
the
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
you
had
,
Miss
:
but
she
often
talks
in
this
way
towards
night
--
in
*NL*
the
morning
she
is
calmer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
rose
.
``
Stop
!
''
exclaimed
Mrs.
Reed
,
``
there
is
another
thing
I
wished
to
*NL*
say
.
He
threatens
me
--
he
continually
threatens
me
with
his
own
death
,
or
*NL*
mine
:
and
I
dream
sometimes
that
I
see
him
laid
out
with
a
great
wound
in
*NL*
his
throat
,
or
with
a
swollen
and
blackened
face
.
I
am
come
to
a
strange
*NL*
pass
:
I
have
heavy
troubles
.
What
is
to
be
done
?
How
is
the
money
to
be
*NL*
had
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bessie
now
endeavoured
to
persuade
her
to
take
a
sedative
draught
:
she
*NL*
succeeded
with
difficulty
.
Soon
after
,
Mrs.
Reed
grew
more
composed
,
and
*NL*
sank
into
a
dozing
state
.
I
then
left
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
More
than
ten
days
elapsed
before
I
had
again
any
conversation
with
her
.
*NL*
She
continued
either
delirious
or
lethargic
;
and
the
doctor
forbade
*NL*
everything
which
could
painfully
excite
her
.
Meantime
,
I
got
on
as
well
*NL*
as
I
could
with
Georgiana
and
Eliza
.
They
were
very
cold
,
indeed
,
at
*NL*
first
.
Eliza
would
sit
half
the
day
sewing
,
reading
,
or
writing
,
and
*NL*
scarcely
utter
a
word
either
to
me
or
her
sister
.
Georgiana
would
*NL*
chatter
nonsense
to
her
canary
bird
by
the
hour
,
and
take
no
notice
of
*NL*
me
.
But
I
was
determined
not
to
seem
at
a
loss
for
occupation
or
*NL*
amusement
:
I
had
brought
my
drawing
materials
with
me
,
and
they
served
me
*NL*
for
both
.
*NL*
*NL*
Provided
with
a
case
of
pencils
,
and
some
sheets
of
paper
,
I
used
to
take
*NL*
a
seat
apart
from
them
,
near
the
window
,
and
busy
myself
in
sketching
*NL*
fancy
vignettes
,
representing
any
scene
that
happened
momentarily
to
*NL*
shape
itself
in
the
ever-shifting
kaleidoscope
of
imagination
:
a
glimpse
*NL*
of
sea
between
two
rocks
;
the
rising
moon
,
and
a
ship
crossing
its
disk
;
*NL*
a
group
of
reeds
and
water-flags
,
and
a
naiad
's
head
,
crowned
with
lotus
-
*NL*
flowers
,
rising
out
of
them
;
an
elf
sitting
in
a
hedge-sparrow
's
nest
,
*NL*
under
a
wreath
of
hawthorn-bloom
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
I
fell
to
sketching
a
face
:
what
sort
of
a
face
it
was
to
be
,
*NL*
I
did
not
care
or
know
.
I
took
a
soft
black
pencil
,
gave
it
a
broad
*NL*
point
,
and
worked
away
.
Soon
I
had
traced
on
the
paper
a
broad
and
*NL*
prominent
forehead
and
a
square
lower
outline
of
visage
:
that
contour
*NL*
gave
me
pleasure
;
my
fingers
proceeded
actively
to
fill
it
with
features
.
*NL*
Strongly-marked
horizontal
eyebrows
must
be
traced
under
that
brow
;
then
*NL*
followed
,
naturally
,
a
well-defined
nose
,
with
a
straight
ridge
and
full
*NL*
nostrils
;
then
a
flexible-looking
mouth
,
by
no
means
narrow
;
then
a
firm
*NL*
chin
,
with
a
decided
cleft
down
the
middle
of
it
:
of
course
,
some
black
*NL*
whiskers
were
wanted
,
and
some
jetty
hair
,
tufted
on
the
temples
,
and
*NL*
waved
above
the
forehead
.
Now
for
the
eyes
:
I
had
left
them
to
the
last
,
*NL*
because
they
required
the
most
careful
working
.
I
drew
them
large
;
I
*NL*
shaped
them
well
:
the
eyelashes
I
traced
long
and
sombre
;
the
irids
*NL*
lustrous
and
large
.
``
Good
!
but
not
quite
the
thing
,
''
I
thought
,
as
I
*NL*
surveyed
the
effect
:
``
they
want
more
force
and
spirit
;
''
and
I
wrought
the
*NL*
shades
blacker
,
that
the
lights
might
flash
more
brilliantly
--
a
happy
*NL*
touch
or
two
secured
success
.
There
,
I
had
a
friend
's
face
under
my
*NL*
gaze
;
and
what
did
it
signify
that
those
young
ladies
turned
their
backs
*NL*
on
me
?
I
looked
at
it
;
I
smiled
at
the
speaking
likeness
:
I
was
absorbed
*NL*
and
content
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
a
portrait
of
some
one
you
know
?
''
asked
Eliza
,
who
had
*NL*
approached
me
unnoticed
.
I
responded
that
it
was
merely
a
fancy
head
,
*NL*
and
hurried
it
beneath
the
other
sheets
.
Of
course
,
I
lied
:
it
was
,
in
*NL*
fact
,
a
very
faithful
representation
of
Mr.
Rochester
.
But
what
was
that
*NL*
to
her
,
or
to
any
one
but
myself
?
Georgiana
also
advanced
to
look
.
The
*NL*
other
drawings
pleased
her
much
,
but
she
called
that
``
an
ugly
man
.
''
They
*NL*
both
seemed
surprised
at
my
skill
.
I
offered
to
sketch
their
portraits
;
*NL*
and
each
,
in
turn
,
sat
for
a
pencil
outline
.
Then
Georgiana
produced
her
*NL*
album
.
I
promised
to
contribute
a
water-colour
drawing
:
this
put
her
at
*NL*
once
into
good
humour
.
She
proposed
a
walk
in
the
grounds
.
Before
we
*NL*
had
been
out
two
hours
,
we
were
deep
in
a
confidential
conversation
:
she
*NL*
had
favoured
me
with
a
description
of
the
brilliant
winter
she
had
spent
*NL*
in
London
two
seasons
ago
--
of
the
admiration
she
had
there
excited
--
the
*NL*
attention
she
had
received
;
and
I
even
got
hints
of
the
titled
conquest
*NL*
she
had
made
.
In
the
course
of
the
afternoon
and
evening
these
hints
*NL*
were
enlarged
on
:
various
soft
conversations
were
reported
,
and
*NL*
sentimental
scenes
represented
;
and
,
in
short
,
a
volume
of
a
novel
of
*NL*
fashionable
life
was
that
day
improvised
by
her
for
my
benefit
.
The
*NL*
communications
were
renewed
from
day
to
day
:
they
always
ran
on
the
same
*NL*
theme
--
herself
,
her
loves
,
and
woes
.
It
was
strange
she
never
once
*NL*
adverted
either
to
her
mother
's
illness
,
or
her
brother
's
death
,
or
the
*NL*
present
gloomy
state
of
the
family
prospects
.
Her
mind
seemed
wholly
*NL*
taken
up
with
reminiscences
of
past
gaiety
,
and
aspirations
after
*NL*
dissipations
to
come
.
She
passed
about
five
minutes
each
day
in
her
*NL*
mother
's
sick-room
,
and
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eliza
still
spoke
little
:
she
had
evidently
no
time
to
talk
.
I
never
saw
*NL*
a
busier
person
than
she
seemed
to
be
;
yet
it
was
difficult
to
say
what
*NL*
she
did
:
or
rather
,
to
discover
any
result
of
her
diligence
.
She
had
an
*NL*
alarm
to
call
her
up
early
.
I
know
not
how
she
occupied
herself
before
*NL*
breakfast
,
but
after
that
meal
she
divided
her
time
into
regular
*NL*
portions
,
and
each
hour
had
its
allotted
task
.
Three
times
a
day
she
*NL*
studied
a
little
book
,
which
I
found
,
on
inspection
,
was
a
Common
Prayer
*NL*
Book
.
I
asked
her
once
what
was
the
great
attraction
of
that
volume
,
and
*NL*
she
said
,
``
the
Rubric
.
''
Three
hours
she
gave
to
stitching
,
with
gold
*NL*
thread
,
the
border
of
a
square
crimson
cloth
,
almost
large
enough
for
a
*NL*
carpet
.
In
answer
to
my
inquiries
after
the
use
of
this
article
,
she
*NL*
informed
me
it
was
a
covering
for
the
altar
of
a
new
church
lately
*NL*
erected
near
Gateshead
.
Two
hours
she
devoted
to
her
diary
;
two
to
*NL*
working
by
herself
in
the
kitchen-garden
;
and
one
to
the
regulation
of
*NL*
her
accounts
.
She
seemed
to
want
no
company
;
no
conversation
.
I
believe
*NL*
she
was
happy
in
her
way
:
this
routine
sufficed
for
her
;
and
nothing
*NL*
annoyed
her
so
much
as
the
occurrence
of
any
incident
which
forced
her
to
*NL*
vary
its
clockwork
regularity
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
told
me
one
evening
,
when
more
disposed
to
be
communicative
than
*NL*
usual
,
that
John
's
conduct
,
and
the
threatened
ruin
of
the
family
,
had
*NL*
been
a
source
of
profound
affliction
to
her
:
but
she
had
now
,
she
said
,
*NL*
settled
her
mind
,
and
formed
her
resolution
.
Her
own
fortune
she
had
*NL*
taken
care
to
secure
;
and
when
her
mother
died
--
and
it
was
wholly
*NL*
improbable
,
she
tranquilly
remarked
,
that
she
should
either
recover
or
*NL*
linger
long
--
she
would
execute
a
long-cherished
project
:
seek
a
*NL*
retirement
where
punctual
habits
would
be
permanently
secured
from
*NL*
disturbance
,
and
place
safe
barriers
between
herself
and
a
frivolous
*NL*
world
.
I
asked
if
Georgiana
would
accompany
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
not
.
Georgiana
and
she
had
nothing
in
common
:
they
never
had
*NL*
had
.
She
would
not
be
burdened
with
her
society
for
any
consideration
.
*NL*
Georgiana
should
take
her
own
course
;
and
she
,
Eliza
,
would
take
hers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Georgiana
,
when
not
unburdening
her
heart
to
me
,
spent
most
of
her
time
*NL*
in
lying
on
the
sofa
,
fretting
about
the
dulness
of
the
house
,
and
*NL*
wishing
over
and
over
again
that
her
aunt
Gibson
would
send
her
an
*NL*
invitation
up
to
town
.
``
It
would
be
so
much
better
,
''
she
said
,
``
if
she
*NL*
could
only
get
out
of
the
way
for
a
month
or
two
,
till
all
was
over
.
''
I
*NL*
did
not
ask
what
she
meant
by
``
all
being
over
,
''
but
I
suppose
she
*NL*
referred
to
the
expected
decease
of
her
mother
and
the
gloomy
sequel
of
*NL*
funeral
rites
.
Eliza
generally
took
no
more
notice
of
her
sister
's
*NL*
indolence
and
complaints
than
if
no
such
murmuring
,
lounging
object
had
*NL*
been
before
her
.
One
day
,
however
,
as
she
put
away
her
account-book
and
*NL*
unfolded
her
embroidery
,
she
suddenly
took
her
up
thus
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Georgiana
,
a
more
vain
and
absurd
animal
than
you
was
certainly
never
*NL*
allowed
to
cumber
the
earth
.
You
had
no
right
to
be
born
,
for
you
make
*NL*
no
use
of
life
.
Instead
of
living
for
,
in
,
and
with
yourself
,
as
a
*NL*
reasonable
being
ought
,
you
seek
only
to
fasten
your
feebleness
on
some
*NL*
other
person
's
strength
:
if
no
one
can
be
found
willing
to
burden
her
or
*NL*
himself
with
such
a
fat
,
weak
,
puffy
,
useless
thing
,
you
cry
out
that
you
*NL*
are
ill-treated
,
neglected
,
miserable
.
Then
,
too
,
existence
for
you
must
*NL*
be
a
scene
of
continual
change
and
excitement
,
or
else
the
world
is
a
*NL*
dungeon
:
you
must
be
admired
,
you
must
be
courted
,
you
must
be
*NL*
flattered
--
you
must
have
music
,
dancing
,
and
society
--
or
you
languish
,
*NL*
you
die
away
.
Have
you
no
sense
to
devise
a
system
which
will
make
you
*NL*
independent
of
all
efforts
,
and
all
wills
,
but
your
own
?
Take
one
day
;
*NL*
share
it
into
sections
;
to
each
section
apportion
its
task
:
leave
no
*NL*
stray
unemployed
quarters
of
an
hour
,
ten
minutes
,
five
minutes
--
include
*NL*
all
;
do
each
piece
of
business
in
its
turn
with
method
,
with
rigid
*NL*
regularity
.
The
day
will
close
almost
before
you
are
aware
it
has
begun
;
*NL*
and
you
are
indebted
to
no
one
for
helping
you
to
get
rid
of
one
vacant
*NL*
moment
:
you
have
had
to
seek
no
one
's
company
,
conversation
,
sympathy
,
*NL*
forbearance
;
you
have
lived
,
in
short
,
as
an
independent
being
ought
to
*NL*
do
.
Take
this
advice
:
the
first
and
last
I
shall
offer
you
;
then
you
*NL*
will
not
want
me
or
any
one
else
,
happen
what
may
.
Neglect
it
--
go
on
as
*NL*
heretofore
,
craving
,
whining
,
and
idling
--
and
suffer
the
results
of
your
*NL*
idiocy
,
however
bad
and
insuperable
they
may
be
.
I
tell
you
this
*NL*
plainly
;
and
listen
:
for
though
I
shall
no
more
repeat
what
I
am
now
*NL*
about
to
say
,
I
shall
steadily
act
on
it
.
After
my
mother
's
death
,
I
*NL*
wash
my
hands
of
you
:
from
the
day
her
coffin
is
carried
to
the
vault
in
*NL*
Gateshead
Church
,
you
and
I
will
be
as
separate
as
if
we
had
never
known
*NL*
each
other
.
You
need
not
think
that
because
we
chanced
to
be
born
of
the
*NL*
same
parents
,
I
shall
suffer
you
to
fasten
me
down
by
even
the
feeblest
*NL*
claim
:
I
can
tell
you
this
--
if
the
whole
human
race
,
ourselves
excepted
,
*NL*
were
swept
away
,
and
we
two
stood
alone
on
the
earth
,
I
would
leave
you
*NL*
in
the
old
world
,
and
betake
myself
to
the
new
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
closed
her
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
might
have
spared
yourself
the
trouble
of
delivering
that
tirade
,
''
*NL*
answered
Georgiana
.
``
Everybody
knows
you
are
the
most
selfish
,
heartless
*NL*
creature
in
existence
:
and
_
I
_
know
your
spiteful
hatred
towards
me
:
I
*NL*
have
had
a
specimen
of
it
before
in
the
trick
you
played
me
about
Lord
*NL*
Edwin
Vere
:
you
could
not
bear
me
to
be
raised
above
you
,
to
have
a
*NL*
title
,
to
be
received
into
circles
where
you
dare
not
show
your
face
,
and
*NL*
so
you
acted
the
spy
and
informer
,
and
ruined
my
prospects
for
ever
.
''
*NL*
Georgiana
took
out
her
handkerchief
and
blew
her
nose
for
an
hour
*NL*
afterwards
;
Eliza
sat
cold
,
impassable
,
and
assiduously
industrious
.
*NL*
*NL*
True
,
generous
feeling
is
made
small
account
of
by
some
,
but
here
were
*NL*
two
natures
rendered
,
the
one
intolerably
acrid
,
the
other
despicably
*NL*
savourless
for
the
want
of
it
.
Feeling
without
judgment
is
a
washy
*NL*
draught
indeed
;
but
judgment
untempered
by
feeling
is
too
bitter
and
*NL*
husky
a
morsel
for
human
deglutition
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
wet
and
windy
afternoon
:
Georgiana
had
fallen
asleep
on
the
sofa
*NL*
over
the
perusal
of
a
novel
;
Eliza
was
gone
to
attend
a
saint
's
-
day
*NL*
service
at
the
new
church
--
for
in
matters
of
religion
she
was
a
rigid
*NL*
formalist
:
no
weather
ever
prevented
the
punctual
discharge
of
what
she
*NL*
considered
her
devotional
duties
;
fair
or
foul
,
she
went
to
church
thrice
*NL*
every
Sunday
,
and
as
often
on
week-days
as
there
were
prayers
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
bethought
myself
to
go
upstairs
and
see
how
the
dying
woman
sped
,
who
*NL*
lay
there
almost
unheeded
:
the
very
servants
paid
her
but
a
remittent
*NL*
attention
:
the
hired
nurse
,
being
little
looked
after
,
would
slip
out
of
*NL*
the
room
whenever
she
could
.
Bessie
was
faithful
;
but
she
had
her
own
*NL*
family
to
mind
,
and
could
only
come
occasionally
to
the
hall
.
I
found
*NL*
the
sick-room
unwatched
,
as
I
had
expected
:
no
nurse
was
there
;
the
*NL*
patient
lay
still
,
and
seemingly
lethargic
;
her
livid
face
sunk
in
the
*NL*
pillows
:
the
fire
was
dying
in
the
grate
.
I
renewed
the
fuel
,
*NL*
re-arranged
the
bedclothes
,
gazed
awhile
on
her
who
could
not
now
gaze
on
*NL*
me
,
and
then
I
moved
away
to
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rain
beat
strongly
against
the
panes
,
the
wind
blew
tempestuously
:
*NL*
``
One
lies
there
,
''
I
thought
,
``
who
will
soon
be
beyond
the
war
of
earthly
*NL*
elements
.
Whither
will
that
spirit
--
now
struggling
to
quit
its
material
*NL*
tenement
--
flit
when
at
length
released
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
pondering
the
great
mystery
,
I
thought
of
Helen
Burns
,
recalled
her
*NL*
dying
words
--
her
faith
--
her
doctrine
of
the
equality
of
disembodied
*NL*
souls
.
I
was
still
listening
in
thought
to
her
well-remembered
*NL*
tones
--
still
picturing
her
pale
and
spiritual
aspect
,
her
wasted
face
and
*NL*
sublime
gaze
,
as
she
lay
on
her
placid
deathbed
,
and
whispered
her
*NL*
longing
to
be
restored
to
her
divine
Father
's
bosom
--
when
a
feeble
voice
*NL*
murmured
from
the
couch
behind
:
``
Who
is
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
knew
Mrs.
Reed
had
not
spoken
for
days
:
was
she
reviving
?
I
went
up
to
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
I
,
Aunt
Reed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
--
I
?
''
was
her
answer
.
``
Who
are
you
?
''
looking
at
me
with
surprise
and
*NL*
a
sort
of
alarm
,
but
still
not
wildly
.
``
You
are
quite
a
stranger
to
*NL*
me
--
where
is
Bessie
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
at
the
lodge
,
aunt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aunt
,
''
she
repeated
.
``
Who
calls
me
aunt
?
You
are
not
one
of
the
*NL*
Gibsons
;
and
yet
I
know
you
--
that
face
,
and
the
eyes
and
forehead
,
are
*NL*
quiet
familiar
to
me
:
you
are
like
--
why
,
you
are
like
Jane
Eyre
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
nothing
:
I
was
afraid
of
occasioning
some
shock
by
declaring
my
*NL*
identity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
,
''
said
she
,
``
I
am
afraid
it
is
a
mistake
:
my
thoughts
deceive
me
.
I
*NL*
wished
to
see
Jane
Eyre
,
and
I
fancy
a
likeness
where
none
exists
:
*NL*
besides
,
in
eight
years
she
must
be
so
changed
.
''
I
now
gently
assured
*NL*
her
that
I
was
the
person
she
supposed
and
desired
me
to
be
:
and
seeing
*NL*
that
I
was
understood
,
and
that
her
senses
were
quite
collected
,
I
*NL*
explained
how
Bessie
had
sent
her
husband
to
fetch
me
from
Thornfield
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
ill
,
I
know
,
''
she
said
ere
long
.
``
I
was
trying
to
turn
myself
*NL*
a
few
minutes
since
,
and
find
I
can
not
move
a
limb
.
It
is
as
well
I
*NL*
should
ease
my
mind
before
I
die
:
what
we
think
little
of
in
health
,
*NL*
burdens
us
at
such
an
hour
as
the
present
is
to
me
.
Is
the
nurse
here
?
*NL*
or
is
there
no
one
in
the
room
but
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
assured
her
we
were
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
have
twice
done
you
a
wrong
which
I
regret
now
.
One
was
in
*NL*
breaking
the
promise
which
I
gave
my
husband
to
bring
you
up
as
my
own
*NL*
child
;
the
other
--
''
she
stopped
.
``
After
all
,
it
is
of
no
great
*NL*
importance
,
perhaps
,
''
she
murmured
to
herself
:
``
and
then
I
may
get
*NL*
better
;
and
to
humble
myself
so
to
her
is
painful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
made
an
effort
to
alter
her
position
,
but
failed
:
her
face
changed
;
*NL*
she
seemed
to
experience
some
inward
sensation
--
the
precursor
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
of
the
last
pang
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
must
get
it
over
.
Eternity
is
before
me
:
I
had
better
tell
*NL*
her
.
--
Go
to
my
dressing-case
,
open
it
,
and
take
out
a
letter
you
will
see
*NL*
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
obeyed
her
directions
.
``
Read
the
letter
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
short
,
and
thus
conceived
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madam
,
--
Will
you
have
the
goodness
to
send
me
the
address
of
my
*NL*
niece
,
Jane
Eyre

and
to
tell
me
how
she
is
?
It
is
my
intention
to
*NL*
write
shortly
and
desire
her
to
come
to
me
at
Madeira
.
Providence
has
*NL*
blessed
my
endeavours
to
secure
a
competency
;
and
as
I
am
unmarried
*NL*
and
childless
,
I
wish
to
adopt
her
during
my
life
,
and
bequeath
her
at
*NL*
my
death
whatever
I
may
have
to
leave

``
JOHN
EYRE

*NL*
It
was
dated
three
years
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
I
never
hear
of
this
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
disliked
you
too
fixedly
and
thoroughly
ever
to
lend

lifting
you

I
could
not
forget
your
conduct
to
me

*NL*
Jane
--
the
fury
with
which
you
once
turned
on
me
;
the
tone
in
which
you
*NL*
declared
you
abhorred
me
the
worst
of
anybody
in
the
world

the
*NL*
unchildlike
look
and
voice
with
which
you
affirmed
that
the
very
thought
*NL*
of
me
made
you
sick
,
and
asserted
that
I
had
treated
you
with
miserable
*NL*
cruelty

I
could
not
forget
my
own
sensations
when
you
thus
started
up
*NL*
and
poured
out
the
venom
of
your
mind
:
I
felt
fear
as
if
an
animal
that
I
*NL*
had
struck
or
pushed
had
looked
up
at
me
with
human
eyes

cursed
me
in

a
man

voice

make
haste

``
Dear

draught

nine

She
heeded
nothing
of
what
I
said

but
when
she
had
tasted
the
water
and

drawn
breath

she
went
on
thus

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
I

not

for
you

be

adopted
by
your
uncle
,
and
placed
in
a
state
of
ease

comfort

was
*NL*
what
I
could
not
endure

I
wrote
to
him

said

sorry

disappointment

dead

act

write

contradict
my
assertion

expose

my
falsehood

soon

you
like

were
born
,
I
think

to
be
my

torment

my
last
hour

racked
by
the
recollection

patient

quiescent
under
any
treatment

in

tenth
break
out
all
fire

violence

``
My

I
approached
my
cheek
to
her
lips

she
would
not
touch
it

She
said
I
*NL*
oppressed
her
by
leaning
over
the
bed

again
demanded
water

laid

down

raised

supported

drank

covered
her
ice-cold

clammy
hand
with
mine
:
the
feeble
*NL*
fingers
shrank
from
my
touch
--
the
glazing
eyes
shunned
my
gaze
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Love
me
,
then
,
or
hate
me
,
as
you
will
,
''
I
said
at
last
,
``
you
have
my
*NL*
full
and
free
forgiveness
:
ask
now
for
God
's
,
and
be
at
peace
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
,
suffering
woman
!
it
was
too
late
for
her
to
make
now
the
effort
to
*NL*
change
her
habitual
frame
of
mind
:
living
,
she
had
ever
hated
me
--
dying
,
*NL*
she
must
hate
me
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
nurse
now
entered
,
and
Bessie
followed
.
I
yet
lingered
half-an-hour
*NL*
longer
,
hoping
to
see
some
sign
of
amity
:
but
she
gave
none
.
She
was
*NL*
fast
relapsing
into
stupor
;
nor
did
her
mind
again
rally
:
at
twelve
*NL*
o'clock
that
night
she
died
.
I
was
not
present
to
close
her
eyes
,
nor
*NL*
were
either
of
her
daughters
.
They
came
to
tell
us
the
next
morning
that
*NL*
all
was
over
.
She
was
by
that
time
laid
out
.
Eliza
and
I
went
to
look
*NL*
at
her
:
Georgiana
,
who
had
burst
out
into
loud
weeping
,
said
she
dared
*NL*
not
go
.
There
was
stretched
Sarah
Reed
's
once
robust
and
active
frame
,
*NL*
rigid
and
still
:
her
eye
of
flint
was
covered
with
its
cold
lid
;
her
brow
*NL*
and
strong
traits
wore
yet
the
impress
of
her
inexorable
soul
.
A
strange
*NL*
and
solemn
object
was
that
corpse
to
me
.
I
gazed
on
it
with
gloom
and
*NL*
pain
:
nothing
soft
,
nothing
sweet
,
nothing
pitying
,
or
hopeful
,
or
*NL*
subduing
did
it
inspire
;
only
a
grating
anguish
for
_
her
_
woes
--
not
_
my
_
*NL*
loss
--
and
a
sombre
tearless
dismay
at
the
fearfulness
of
death
in
such
a
*NL*
form
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eliza
surveyed
her
parent
calmly
.
After
a
silence
of
some
minutes
she
*NL*
observed
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
her
constitution
she
should
have
lived
to
a
good
old
age
:
her
life
*NL*
was
shortened
by
trouble
.
''
And
then
a
spasm
constricted
her
mouth
for
an
*NL*
instant
:
as
it
passed
away
she
turned
and
left
the
room
,
and
so
did
I.
*NL*
Neither
of
us
had
dropt
a
tear
.

CHAPTER
XXII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Rochester
had
given
me
but
one
week
's
leave
of
absence
:
yet
a
month
*NL*
elapsed
before
I
quitted
Gateshead
.
I
wished
to
leave
immediately
after
*NL*
the
funeral
,
but
Georgiana
entreated
me
to
stay
till
she
could
get
off
to
*NL*
London
,
whither
she
was
now
at
last
invited
by
her
uncle
,
Mr.
Gibson
,
who
*NL*
had
come
down
to
direct
his
sister
's
interment
and
settle
the
family
*NL*
affairs
.
Georgiana
said
she
dreaded
being
left
alone
with
Eliza
;
from
*NL*
her
she
got
neither
sympathy
in
her
dejection
,
support
in
her
fears
,
nor
*NL*
aid
in
her
preparations
;
so
I
bore
with
her
feeble-minded
wailings
and
*NL*
selfish
lamentations
as
well
as
I
could
,
and
did
my
best
in
sewing
for
*NL*
her
and
packing
her
dresses
.
It
is
true
,
that
while
I
worked
,
she
would
*NL*
idle
;
and
I
thought
to
myself
,
``
If
you
and
I
were
destined
to
live
always
*NL*
together
,
cousin
,
we
would
commence
matters
on
a
different
footing
.
I
*NL*
should
not
settle
tamely
down
into
being
the
forbearing
party
;
I
should
*NL*
assign
you
your
share
of
labour
,
and
compel
you
to
accomplish
it
,
or
else
*NL*
it
should
be
left
undone
:
I
should
insist
,
also
,
on
your
keeping
some
of
*NL*
those
drawling
,
half-insincere
complaints
hushed
in
your
own
breast
.
It
*NL*
is
only
because
our
connection
happens
to
be
very
transitory
,
and
comes
*NL*
at
a
peculiarly
mournful
season
,
that
I
consent
thus
to
render
it
so
*NL*
patient
and
compliant
on
my
part
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
I
saw
Georgiana
off
;
but
now
it
was
Eliza
's
turn
to
request
me
to
*NL*
stay
another
week
.
Her
plans
required
all
her
time
and
attention
,
she
*NL*
said
;
she
was
about
to
depart
for
some
unknown
bourne
;
and
all
day
long
*NL*
she
stayed
in
her
own
room
,
her
door
bolted
within
,
filling
trunks
,
*NL*
emptying
drawers
,
burning
papers
,
and
holding
no
communication
with
any
*NL*
one
.
She
wished
me
to
look
after
the
house
,
to
see
callers
,
and
answer
*NL*
notes
of
condolence
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
she
told
me
I
was
at
liberty
.
``
And
,
''
she
added
,
``
I
am
*NL*
obliged
to
you
for
your
valuable
services
and
discreet
conduct
!
There
is
*NL*
some
difference
between
living
with
such
an
one
as
you
and
with
*NL*
Georgiana
:
you
perform
your
own
part
in
life
and
burden
no
one
.
*NL*
To-morrow
,
''
she
continued
,
``
I
set
out
for
the
Continent
.
I
shall
take
up
*NL*
my
abode
in
a
religious
house
near
Lisle
--
a
nunnery
you
would
call
it
;
*NL*
there
I
shall
be
quiet
and
unmolested
.
I
shall
devote
myself
for
a
time
*NL*
to
the
examination
of
the
Roman
Catholic
dogmas
,
and
to
a
careful
study
*NL*
of
the
workings
of
their
system
:
if
I
find
it
to
be
,
as
I
half
suspect
it
*NL*
is
,
the
one
best
calculated
to
ensure
the
doing
of
all
things
decently
*NL*
and
in
order
,
I
shall
embrace
the
tenets
of
Rome
and
probably
take
the
*NL*
veil
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
neither
expressed
surprise
at
this
resolution
nor
attempted
to
dissuade
*NL*
her
from
it
.
``
The
vocation
will
fit
you
to
a
hair
,
''
I
thought
:
``
much
*NL*
good
may
it
do
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
parted
,
she
said
:
``
Good-bye
,
cousin
Jane
Eyre
;
I
wish
you
well
:
*NL*
you
have
some
sense
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
then
returned
:
``
You
are
not
without
sense
,
cousin
Eliza
;
but
what
you
*NL*
have
,
I
suppose
,
in
another
year
will
be
walled
up
alive
in
a
French
*NL*
convent
.
However
,
it
is
not
my
business
,
and
so
it
suits
you
,
I
do
n't
*NL*
much
care
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
in
the
right
,
''
said
she
;
and
with
these
words
we
each
went
our
*NL*
separate
way
.
As
I
shall
not
have
occasion
to
refer
either
to
her
or
her
*NL*
sister
again
,
I
may
as
well
mention
here
,
that
Georgiana
made
an
*NL*
advantageous
match
with
a
wealthy
worn-out
man
of
fashion
,
and
that
Eliza
*NL*
actually
took
the
veil
,
and
is
at
this
day
superior
of
the
convent
where
*NL*
she
passed
the
period
of
her
novitiate
,
and
which
she
endowed
with
her
*NL*
fortune
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
people
feel
when
they
are
returning
home
from
an
absence
,
long
or
*NL*
short
,
I
did
not
know
:
I
had
never
experienced
the
sensation
.
I
had
*NL*
known
what
it
was
to
come
back
to
Gateshead
when
a
child
after
a
long
*NL*
walk
,
to
be
scolded
for
looking
cold
or
gloomy
;
and
later
,
what
it
was
to
*NL*
come
back
from
church
to
Lowood
,
to
long
for
a
plenteous
meal
and
a
good
*NL*
fire
,
and
to
be
unable
to
get
either
.
Neither
of
these
returnings
was
*NL*
very
pleasant
or
desirable
:
no
magnet
drew
me
to
a
given
point
,
*NL*
increasing
in
its
strength
of
attraction
the
nearer
I
came
.
The
return
*NL*
to
Thornfield
was
yet
to
be
tried
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
journey
seemed
tedious
--
very
tedious
:
fifty
miles
one
day
,
a
night
*NL*
spent
at
an
inn
;
fifty
miles
the
next
day
.
During
the
first
twelve
hours
*NL*
I
thought
of
Mrs.
Reed
in
her
last
moments
;
I
saw
her
disfigured
and
*NL*
discoloured
face
,
and
heard
her
strangely
altered
voice
.
I
mused
on
the
*NL*
funeral
day
,
the
coffin
,
the
hearse
,
the
black
train
of
tenants
and
*NL*
servants
--
few
was
the
number
of
relatives
--
the
gaping
vault
,
the
silent
*NL*
church
,
the
solemn
service
.
Then
I
thought
of
Eliza
and
Georgiana
;
I
*NL*
beheld
one
the
cynosure
of
a
ball-room
,
the
other
the
inmate
of
a
convent
*NL*
cell
;
and
I
dwelt
on
and
analysed
their
separate
peculiarities
of
person
*NL*
and
character
.
The
evening
arrival
at
the
great
town
of
--
scattered
these
*NL*
thoughts
;
night
gave
them
quite
another
turn
:
laid
down
on
my
traveller
's
*NL*
bed
,
I
left
reminiscence
for
anticipation
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
going
back
to
Thornfield
:
but
how
long
was
I
to
stay
there
?
Not
*NL*
long
;
of
that
I
was
sure
.
I
had
heard
from
Mrs.
Fairfax
in
the
interim
*NL*
of
my
absence
:
the
party
at
the
hall
was
dispersed
;
Mr.
Rochester
had
*NL*
left
for
London
three
weeks
ago
,
but
he
was
then
expected
to
return
in
a
*NL*
fortnight
.
Mrs.
Fairfax
surmised
that
he
was
gone
to
make
arrangements
*NL*
for
his
wedding
,
as
he
had
talked
of
purchasing
a
new
carriage
:
she
said
*NL*
the
idea
of
his
marrying
Miss
Ingram
still
seemed
strange
to
her
;
but
*NL*
from
what
everybody
said
,
and
from
what
she
had
herself
seen
,
she
could
*NL*
no
longer
doubt
that
the
event
would
shortly
take
place
.
``
You
would
be
*NL*
strangely
incredulous
if
you
did
doubt
it
,
''
was
my
mental
comment
.
``
I
*NL*
do
n't
doubt
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
question
followed
,
``
Where
was
I
to
go
?
''
I
dreamt
of
Miss
Ingram
all
*NL*
the
night
:
in
a
vivid
morning
dream
I
saw
her
closing
the
gates
of
*NL*
Thornfield
against
me
and
pointing
me
out
another
road
;
and
Mr.
Rochester
*NL*
looked
on
with
his
arms
folded
--
smiling
sardonically
,
as
it
seemed
,
at
*NL*
both
her
and
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
not
notified
to
Mrs.
Fairfax
the
exact
day
of
my
return
;
for
I
did
*NL*
not
wish
either
car
or
carriage
to
meet
me
at
Millcote
.
I
proposed
to
*NL*
walk
the
distance
quietly
by
myself
;
and
very
quietly
,
after
leaving
my
*NL*
box
in
the
ostler
's
care
,
did
I
slip
away
from
the
George
Inn
,
about
six
*NL*
o'clock
of
a
June
evening
,
and
take
the
old
road
to
Thornfield
:
a
road
*NL*
which
lay
chiefly
through
fields
,
and
was
now
little
frequented
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
a
bright
or
splendid
summer
evening
,
though
fair
and
soft
:
the
*NL*
haymakers
were
at
work
all
along
the
road
;
and
the
sky
,
though
far
from
*NL*
cloudless
,
was
such
as
promised
well
for
the
future
:
its
blue
--
where
blue
*NL*
was
visible
--
was
mild
and
settled
,
and
its
cloud
strata
high
and
thin
.
*NL*
The
west
,
too
,
was
warm
:
no
watery
gleam
chilled
it
--
it
seemed
as
if
*NL*
there
was
a
fire
lit
,
an
altar
burning
behind
its
screen
of
marbled
*NL*
vapour
,
and
out
of
apertures
shone
a
golden
redness
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
glad
as
the
road
shortened
before
me
:
so
glad
that
I
stopped
once
*NL*
to
ask
myself
what
that
joy
meant
:
and
to
remind
reason
that
it
was
not
*NL*
to
my
home
I
was
going
,
or
to
a
permanent
resting-place
,
or
to
a
place
*NL*
where
fond
friends
looked
out
for
me
and
waited
my
arrival
.
``
Mrs.
*NL*
Fairfax
will
smile
you
a
calm
welcome
,
to
be
sure
,
''
said
I
;
``
and
little
*NL*
Adele
will
clap
her
hands
and
jump
to
see
you
:
but
you
know
very
well
you
*NL*
are
thinking
of
another
than
they
,
and
that
he
is
not
thinking
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
what
is
so
headstrong
as
youth
?
What
so
blind
as
inexperience
?
These
*NL*
affirmed
that
it
was
pleasure
enough
to
have
the
privilege
of
again
*NL*
looking
on
Mr.
Rochester
,
whether
he
looked
on
me
or
not
;
and
they
*NL*
added
--
``
Hasten
!
hasten
!
be
with
him
while
you
may
:
but
a
few
more
days
or
*NL*
weeks
,
at
most
,
and
you
are
parted
from
him
for
ever
!
''
And
then
I
*NL*
strangled
a
new-born
agony
--
a
deformed
thing
which
I
could
not
persuade
*NL*
myself
to
own
and
rear
--
and
ran
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
are
making
hay
,
too
,
in
Thornfield
meadows
:
or
rather
,
the
labourers
*NL*
are
just
quitting
their
work
,
and
returning
home
with
their
rakes
on
*NL*
their
shoulders
,
now
,
at
the
hour
I
arrive
.
I
have
but
a
field
or
two
to
*NL*
traverse
,
and
then
I
shall
cross
the
road
and
reach
the
gates
.
How
full
*NL*
the
hedges
are
of
roses
!
But
I
have
no
time
to
gather
any
;
I
want
to
be
*NL*
at
the
house
.
I
passed
a
tall
briar
,
shooting
leafy
and
flowery
branches
*NL*
across
the
path
;
I
see
the
narrow
stile
with
stone
steps
;
and
I
see
--
Mr.
*NL*
Rochester
sitting
there
,
a
book
and
a
pencil
in
his
hand
;
he
is
writing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
he
is
not
a
ghost
;
yet
every
nerve
I
have
is
unstrung
:
for
a
moment
*NL*
I
am
beyond
my
own
mastery
.
What
does
it
mean
?
I
did
not
think
I
should
*NL*
tremble
in
this
way
when
I
saw
him
,
or
lose
my
voice
or
the
power
of
*NL*
motion
in
his
presence
.
I
will
go
back
as
soon
as
I
can
stir
:
I
need
not
*NL*
make
an
absolute
fool
of
myself
.
I
know
another
way
to
the
house
.
It
*NL*
does
not
signify
if
I
knew
twenty
ways
;
for
he
has
seen
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hillo
!
''
he
cries
;
and
he
puts
up
his
book
and
his
pencil
.
``
There
you
*NL*
are
!
Come
on
,
if
you
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
suppose
I
do
come
on
;
though
in
what
fashion
I
know
not
;
being
scarcely
*NL*
cognisant
of
my
movements
,
and
solicitous
only
to
appear
calm
;
and
,
above
*NL*
all
,
to
control
the
working
muscles
of
my
face
--
which
I
feel
rebel
*NL*
insolently
against
my
will
,
and
struggle
to
express
what
I
had
resolved
*NL*
to
conceal
.
But
I
have
a
veil
--
it
is
down
:
I
may
make
shift
yet
to
*NL*
behave
with
decent
composure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
this
is
Jane
Eyre
?
Are
you
coming
from
Millcote
,
and
on
foot
?
*NL*
Yes
--
just
one
of
your
tricks
:
not
to
send
for
a
carriage
,
and
come
*NL*
clattering
over
street
and
road
like
a
common
mortal
,
but
to
steal
into
*NL*
the
vicinage
of
your
home
along
with
twilight
,
just
as
if
you
were
a
*NL*
dream
or
a
shade
.
What
the
deuce
have
you
done
with
yourself
this
last
*NL*
month
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
with
my
aunt
,
sir
,
who
is
dead

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
true
Janian
reply
!
Good
angels
be
my
guard

She
comes
from
the
other
*NL*
world
--
from
the
abode
of
people
who
are
dead
;
and
tells
me
so
when
she
*NL*
meets
me
alone
here
in
the
gloaming
!
If
I
dared
,
I
'd
touch
you
,
to
see
*NL*
if
you
are
substance
or
shadow

you
elf

but
I
'd
as
soon
offer
to
take
*NL*
hold
of
a
blue
_
ignis
fatuus
_
light
in
a
marsh
.
Truant
!
truant
!
''
he
*NL*
added
,
when
he
had
paused
an
instant
.
``
Absent
from
me
a
whole
month
,
and
*NL*
forgetting
me
quite
,
I
'll
be
sworn
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
knew
there
would
be
pleasure
in
meeting
my
master
again
,
even
though
*NL*
broken
by
the
fear
that
he
was
so
soon
to
cease
to
be
my
master
,
and
by
*NL*
the
knowledge
that
I
was
nothing
to
him
:
but
there
was
ever
in
Mr.
*NL*
Rochester
-LRB-
so
at
least
I
thought
-RRB-
such
a
wealth
of
the
power
of
*NL*
communicating
happiness
,
that
to
taste
but
of
the
crumbs
he
scattered
to
*NL*
stray
and
stranger
birds
like
me
,
was
to
feast
genially
.
His
last
words
*NL*
were
balm
:
they
seemed
to
imply
that
it
imported
something
to
him
whether
*NL*
I
forgot
him
or
not
.
And
he
had
spoken
of
Thornfield
as
my
home
--
would
*NL*
that
it
were
my
home
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
leave
the
stile
,
and
I
hardly
liked
to
ask
to
go
by
.
I
*NL*
inquired
soon
if
he
had
not
been
to
London
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
suppose
you
found
that
out
by
second-sight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Fairfax
told
me
in
a
letter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
did
she
inform
you
what
I
went
to
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
sir
!
Everybody
knew
your
errand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
see
the
carriage
,
Jane
,
and
tell
me
if
you
do
n't
think
it
will
*NL*
suit
Mrs.
Rochester
exactly
;
and
whether
she
wo
n't
look
like
Queen
*NL*
Boadicea
,
leaning
back
against
those
purple
cushions
.
I
wish
,
Jane
,
I
*NL*
were
a
trifle
better
adapted
to
match
with
her
externally
.
Tell
me
now
,
*NL*
fairy
as
you
are
--
ca
n't
you
give
me
a
charm
,
or
a
philter
,
or
something
*NL*
of
that
sort
,
to
make
me
a
handsome
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
past
the
power
of
magic
,
sir
;
''
and
,
in
thought
,
I
added
,
``
A
*NL*
loving
eye
is
all
the
charm
needed
:
to
such
you
are
handsome
enough
;
or
*NL*
rather
your
sternness
has
a
power
beyond
beauty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Rochester
had
sometimes
read
my
unspoken
thoughts
with
an
acumen
to
*NL*
me
incomprehensible
:
in
the
present
instance
he
took
no
notice
of
my
*NL*
abrupt
vocal
response
;
but
he
smiled
at
me
with
a
certain
smile
he
had
of
*NL*
his
own
,
and
which
he
used
but
on
rare
occasions
.
He
seemed
to
think
it
*NL*
too
good
for
common
purposes
:
it
was
the
real
sunshine
of
feeling
--
he
*NL*
shed
it
over
me
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pass
,
Janet
,
''
said
he
,
making
room
for
me
to
cross
the
stile
:
``
go
up
*NL*
home
,
and
stay
your
weary
little
wandering
feet
at
a
friend
's
threshold
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
I
had
now
to
do
was
to
obey
him
in
silence
:
no
need
for
me
to
*NL*
colloquise
further
.
I
got
over
the
stile
without
a
word
,
and
meant
to
*NL*
leave
him
calmly
.
An
impulse
held
me
fast
--
a
force
turned
me
round
.
I
*NL*
said
--
or
something
in
me
said
for
me
,
and
in
spite
of
me
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
Mr.
Rochester
,
for
your
great
kindness
.
I
am
strangely
glad
*NL*
to
get
back
again
to
you
:
and
wherever
you
are
is
my
home
--
my
only
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
walked
on
so
fast
that
even
he
could
hardly
have
overtaken
me
had
he
*NL*
tried
.
Little
Adele
was
half
wild
with
delight
when
she
saw
me
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Fairfax
received
me
with
her
usual
plain
friendliness
.
Leah
smiled
,
and
*NL*
even
Sophie
bid
me
``
bon
soir
''
with
glee
.
This
was
very
pleasant
;
there
*NL*
is
no
happiness
like
that
of
being
loved
by
your
fellow-creatures
,
and
*NL*
feeling
that
your
presence
is
an
addition
to
their
comfort
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
that
evening
shut
my
eyes
resolutely
against
the
future
:
I
stopped
my
*NL*
ears
against
the
voice
that
kept
warning
me
of
near
separation
and
coming
*NL*
grief
.
When
tea
was
over
and
Mrs.
Fairfax
had
taken
her
knitting
,
and
I
*NL*
had
assumed
a
low
seat
near
her
,
and
Adele
,
kneeling
on
the
carpet
,
had
*NL*
nestled
close
up
to
me
,
and
a
sense
of
mutual
affection
seemed
to
*NL*
surround
us
with
a
ring
of
golden
peace
,
I
uttered
a
silent
prayer
that
*NL*
we
might
not
be
parted
far
or
soon
;
but
when
,
as
we
thus
sat
,
Mr.
*NL*
Rochester
entered
,
unannounced
,
and
looking
at
us
,
seemed
to
take
*NL*
pleasure
in
the
spectacle
of
a
group
so
amicable
--
when
he
said
he
*NL*
supposed
the
old
lady
was
all
right
now
that
she
had
got
her
adopted
*NL*
daughter
back
again
,
and
added
that
he
saw
Adele
was
``
prete
a
croquer
sa
*NL*
petite
maman
Anglaise
''
--
I
half
ventured
to
hope
that
he
would
,
even
after
*NL*
his
marriage
,
keep
us
together
somewhere
under
the
shelter
of
his
*NL*
protection
,
and
not
quite
exiled
from
the
sunshine
of
his
presence
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
fortnight
of
dubious
calm
succeeded
my
return
to
Thornfield
Hall
.
*NL*
Nothing
was
said
of
the
master
's
marriage
,
and
I
saw
no
preparation
going
*NL*
on
for
such
an
event
.
Almost
every
day
I
asked
Mrs.
Fairfax
if
she
had
*NL*
yet
heard
anything
decided
:
her
answer
was
always
in
the
negative
.
Once
*NL*
she
said
she
had
actually
put
the
question
to
Mr.
Rochester
as
to
when
he
*NL*
was
going
to
bring
his
bride
home
;
but
he
had
answered
her
only
by
a
joke
*NL*
and
one
of
his
queer
looks
,
and
she
could
not
tell
what
to
make
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
thing
specially
surprised
me
,
and
that
was
,
there
were
no
journeyings
*NL*
backward
and
forward
,
no
visits
to
Ingram
Park
:
to
be
sure
it
was
twenty
*NL*
miles
off
,
on
the
borders
of
another
county
;
but
what
was
that
distance
*NL*
to
an
ardent
lover
?
To
so
practised
and
indefatigable
a
horseman
as
Mr.
*NL*
Rochester
,
it
would
be
but
a
morning
's
ride
.
I
began
to
cherish
hopes
I
*NL*
had
no
right
to
conceive
:
that
the
match
was
broken
off
;
that
rumour
had
*NL*
been
mistaken
;
that
one
or
both
parties
had
changed
their
minds
.
I
used
*NL*
to
look
at
my
master
's
face
to
see
if
it
were
sad
or
fierce
;
but
I
could
*NL*
not
remember
the
time
when
it
had
been
so
uniformly
clear
of
clouds
or
*NL*
evil
feelings
.
If
,
in
the
moments
I
and
my
pupil
spent
with
him
,
I
*NL*
lacked
spirits
and
sank
into
inevitable
dejection
,
he
became
even
gay
.
*NL*
Never
had
he
called
me
more
frequently
to
his
presence
;
never
been
kinder
*NL*
to
me
when
there
--
and
,
alas
!
never
had
I
loved
him
so
well
.

CHAPTER
XXIII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
splendid
Midsummer
shone
over
England
:
skies
so
pure
,
suns
so
radiant
*NL*
as
were
then
seen
in
long
succession
,
seldom
favour
even
singly
,
our
wave
-
*NL*
girt
land
.
It
was
as
if
a
band
of
Italian
days
had
come
from
the
South
,
*NL*
like
a
flock
of
glorious
passenger
birds
,
and
lighted
to
rest
them
on
the
*NL*
cliffs
of
Albion
.
The
hay
was
all
got
in
;
the
fields
round
Thornfield
*NL*
were
green
and
shorn
;
the
roads
white
and
baked
;
the
trees
were
in
their
*NL*
dark
prime
;
hedge
and
wood
,
full-leaved
and
deeply
tinted
,
contrasted
*NL*
well
with
the
sunny
hue
of
the
cleared
meadows
between
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
Midsummer-eve
,
Adele
,
weary
with
gathering
wild
strawberries
in
Hay
*NL*
Lane
half
the
day
,
had
gone
to
bed
with
the
sun
.
I
watched
her
drop
*NL*
asleep
,
and
when
I
left
her
,
I
sought
the
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
now
the
sweetest
hour
of
the
twenty-four
:
--
``
Day
its
fervid
fires
*NL*
had
wasted
,
''
and
dew
fell
cool
on
panting
plain
and
scorched
summit
.
*NL*
Where
the
sun
had
gone
down
in
simple
state
--
pure
of
the
pomp
of
*NL*
clouds
--
spread
a
solemn
purple
,
burning
with
the
light
of
red
jewel
and
*NL*
furnace
flame
at
one
point
,
on
one
hill-peak
,
and
extending
high
and
*NL*
wide
,
soft
and
still
softer
,
over
half
heaven
.
The
east
had
its
own
*NL*
charm
or
fine
deep
blue
,
and
its
own
modest
gem
,
a
casino
and
solitary
*NL*
star
:
soon
it
would
boast
the
moon
;
but
she
was
yet
beneath
the
horizon
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
walked
a
while
on
the
pavement
;
but
a
subtle
,
well-known
scent
--
that
of
*NL*
a
cigar
--
stole
from
some
window
;
I
saw
the
library
casement
open
a
*NL*
handbreadth
;
I
knew
I
might
be
watched
thence
;
so
I
went
apart
into
the
*NL*
orchard
.
No
nook
in
the
grounds
more
sheltered
and
more
Eden-like
;
it
*NL*
was
full
of
trees
,
it
bloomed
with
flowers
:
a
very
high
wall
shut
it
out
*NL*
from
the
court
,
on
one
side
;
on
the
other
,
a
beech
avenue
screened
it
*NL*
from
the
lawn
.
At
the
bottom
was
a
sunk
fence
;
its
sole
separation
from
*NL*
lonely
fields
:
a
winding
walk
,
bordered
with
laurels
and
terminating
in
a
*NL*
giant
horse-chestnut
,
circled
at
the
base
by
a
seat
,
led
down
to
the
*NL*
fence
.
Here
one
could
wander
unseen
.
While
such
honey-dew
fell
,
such
*NL*
silence
reigned
,
such
gloaming
gathered
,
I
felt
as
if
I
could
haunt
such
*NL*
shade
for
ever
;
but
in
threading
the
flower
and
fruit
parterres
at
the
*NL*
upper
part
of
the
enclosure
,
enticed
there
by
the
light
the
now
rising
*NL*
moon
cast
on
this
more
open
quarter
,
my
step
is
stayed
--
not
by
sound
,
not
*NL*
by
sight
,
but
once
more
by
a
warning
fragrance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sweet-briar
and
southernwood
,
jasmine
,
pink
,
and
rose
have
long
been
*NL*
yielding
their
evening
sacrifice
of
incense
:
this
new
scent
is
neither
of
*NL*
shrub
nor
flower
;
it
is
--
I
know
it
well
--
it
is
Mr.
Rochester
's
cigar
.
I
*NL*
look
round
and
I
listen
.
I
see
trees
laden
with
ripening
fruit
.
I
hear
*NL*
a
nightingale
warbling
in
a
wood
half
a
mile
off
;
no
moving
form
is
*NL*
visible
,
no
coming
step
audible
;
but
that
perfume
increases
:
I
must
flee
.
*NL*
I
make
for
the
wicket
leading
to
the
shrubbery
,
and
I
see
Mr.
Rochester
*NL*
entering
.
I
step
aside
into
the
ivy
recess
;
he
will
not
stay
long
:
he
*NL*
will
soon
return
whence
he
came
,
and
if
I
sit
still
he
will
never
see
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
no
--
eventide
is
as
pleasant
to
him
as
to
me
,
and
this
antique
garden
*NL*
as
attractive
;
and
he
strolls
on
,
now
lifting
the
gooseberry-tree
*NL*
branches
to
look
at
the
fruit
,
large
as
plums
,
with
which
they
are
laden
;
*NL*
now
taking
a
ripe
cherry
from
the
wall
;
now
stooping
towards
a
knot
of
*NL*
flowers
,
either
to
inhale
their
fragrance
or
to
admire
the
dew-beads
on
*NL*
their
petals
.
A
great
moth
goes
humming
by
me
;
it
alights
on
a
plant
at
*NL*
Mr.
Rochester
's
foot
:
he
sees
it
,
and
bends
to
examine
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
he
has
his
back
towards
me
,
''
thought
I
,
``
and
he
is
occupied
too
;
*NL*
perhaps
,
if
I
walk
softly
,
I
can
slip
away
unnoticed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
trode
on
an
edging
of
turf
that
the
crackle
of
the
pebbly
gravel
might
*NL*
not
betray
me
:
he
was
standing
among
the
beds
at
a
yard
or
two
distant
*NL*
from
where
I
had
to
pass
;
the
moth
apparently
engaged
him
.
``
I
shall
get
*NL*
by
very
well
,
''
I
meditated
.
As
I
crossed
his
shadow
,
thrown
long
over
*NL*
the
garden
by
the
moon
,
not
yet
risen
high
,
he
said
quietly
,
without
*NL*
turning
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jane
,
come
and
look
at
this
fellow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
made
no
noise
:
he
had
not
eyes
behind
--
could
his
shadow
feel
?
I
*NL*
started
at
first
,
and
then
I
approached
him

*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
at
his
wings

''
said
he
,
``
he
reminds
me
rather
of
a
West
Indian
*NL*
insect

one
does
not
often
see
so
large
and
gay
a
night-rover
in
England
;
*NL*
there
!
he
is
flown

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
moth
roamed
away
.
I
was
sheepishly
retreating
also
;
but
Mr.
*NL*
Rochester
followed
me
,
and
when
we
reached
the
wicket
,
he
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Turn
back
:
on
so
lovely
a
night
it
is
a
shame
to
sit
in
the
house
;
and
*NL*
surely
no
one
can
wish
to
go
to
bed
while
sunset
is
thus
at
meeting
with
*NL*
moonrise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
one
of
my
faults
,
that
though
my
tongue
is
sometimes
prompt
enough
*NL*
at
an
answer
,
there
are
times
when
it
sadly
fails
me
in
framing
an
*NL*
excuse
;
and
always
the
lapse
occurs
at
some
crisis
,
when
a
facile
word
or
*NL*
plausible
pretext
is
specially
wanted
to
get
me
out
of
painful
*NL*
embarrassment
.
I
did
not
like
to
walk
at
this
hour
alone
with
Mr.
*NL*
Rochester
in
the
shadowy
orchard
;
but
I
could
not
find
a
reason
to
allege
*NL*
for
leaving
him
.
I
followed
with
lagging
step
,
and
thoughts
busily
bent
*NL*
on
discovering
a
means
of
extrication
;
but
he
himself
looked
so
composed
*NL*
and
so
grave
also
,
I
became
ashamed
of
feeling
any
confusion
:
the
evil
--
if
*NL*
evil
existent
or
prospective
there
was
--
seemed
to
lie
with
me
only
;
his
*NL*
mind
was
unconscious
and
quiet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jane
,
''
he
recommenced
,
as
we
entered
the
laurel
walk
,
and
slowly
strayed
*NL*
down
in
the
direction
of
the
sunk
fence
and
the
horse-chestnut
,
*NL*
``
Thornfield
is
a
pleasant
place
in
summer

it
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

sir

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
have
become

natural
beauties

a
good
deal

the
organ

Adhesiveness

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
attached
to
it

indeed

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
though
I
do
n't
comprehend
how
it

I
perceive

for
that
foolish
little

Adele

too
;
and
even
for
*NL*
simple
dame
Fairfax
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

in
different

I
have
an
affection

would

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``

he
said
,
and
sighed
and
paused
.
``
It
is
always
the
way
of
events
*NL*
in
this
life

he
continued
presently
:
``
no
sooner
have
you
got
settled
in

a

resting-place

a
voice
calls
out
to
you

rise
and
move
*NL*
on

the
hour
of
repose
is
expired

*NL*
*NL*
``
Must
I
move

I
asked

*NL*
This
was
a
blow

I
did
not

it
prostrate
me

plainly

it

my

enter
into

take
Miss

an

extensive
armful

my
beautiful

I

me

You

not
turning
your
head

look
after
*NL*
more
moths

That

only

flying
away

I
wish
to
remind
you
that
it
was
you

first
said
to
me

with
*NL*
that
discretion
I
respect
in
you

with
that
foresight

prudence

befit
your
responsible

that
in

case
I
married
Miss
Ingram

Adele
had
better
trot

forthwith

I
pass
over
the
sort

slur
conveyed

this
suggestion
on
*NL*
the
character
of
my
beloved

indeed
,
when
you
are
far
away

Janet
,
I
'll
*NL*
try
to
forget
it

I
shall
notice
only
its
wisdom

which
is
such
that
I
*NL*
have
made
it
my
law
of
action
.
Adele
must
go
to
school
;

you

must
get
a

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

will

I
was

myself

I
stopped

feeling
it
would
not
do
to
risk
a
long
*NL*
sentence
,
for
my
voice
was
not
quite
under
command

*NL*
*NL*
``
In
about

continued
Mr.

;
*NL*
``

Oh

consider
that

she
has
a
sort
of
claim

can
conveniently
render

indeed
*NL*
I
have
already

through

heard
of
a
place
that
I
*NL*
think
will
suit

it
is
to
undertake
the
education
of
the
five
daughters
*NL*
of
Mrs.
Dionysius
O'Gall
of
Bitternutt
Lodge
,
Connaught
,
Ireland

You
'll
*NL*
like
Ireland

such
warm-hearted
people
there

they
say
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

I
said
this
almost
involuntarily
,
and
,
with
as
little
sanction
of
free
*NL*
will
,
my
tears
gushed
out
.
I
did
not
cry
so
as
to
be
heard
,
however
;
I
*NL*
avoided
sobbing
.
The
thought
of
Mrs.
O'Gall
and
Bitternutt
Lodge
struck
*NL*
cold
to
my
heart
;
and
colder
the
thought
of
all
the
brine
and
foam
,
*NL*
destined
,
as
it
seemed
,
to
rush
between
me
and
the
master
at
whose
side
I
*NL*
now
walked
,
and
coldest
the
remembrance
of
the
wider
ocean
--
wealth
,
*NL*
caste
,
custom
intervened
between
me
and
what
I
naturally
and
inevitably
*NL*
loved
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
long
way

I
again
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is

I
shall
never
see
you
again
,
Jane

that
's
morally
certain
.
I
*NL*
never
go
over
to
Ireland
,
not
having
myself
much
of
a
fancy
for
the
*NL*
country

We

been
good

we
not

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

And
when

them
close
to
each

Come

we
'll
talk
*NL*
over
the
voyage

the
parting
quietly
half-an-hour

so

the

stars
enter
into

up

He
seated
me

himself

I

tightly

I

convulsively

I
could
repress
what

endured

no

I
was
obliged
to
yield

I
was
shaken
from
head

foot
*NL*
with
acute
distress

When
I
did
speak

it
was
only
to
express

The
vehemence

stirred

was

claiming
mastery

struggling
for

bread
snatched

lips
on
my
lips
:
``
so
,
*NL*
Jane
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
so
,
sir
,
''
I
rejoined
:
``
and
yet
not
so
;
for
you
are
a
married
man
--
or
*NL*
as
good
as
a
married
man
,
and
wed
to
one
inferior
to
you
--
to
one
with
*NL*
whom
you
have
no
sympathy
--
whom
I
do
not
believe
you
truly
love
;
for
I
*NL*
have
seen
and
heard
you
sneer
at
her
.
I
would
scorn
such
a
union
:
*NL*
therefore
I
am
better
than
you
--
let
me
go
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
,
Jane
?
To
Ireland
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
to
Ireland
.
I
have
spoken
my
mind
,
and
can
go
anywhere
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jane
,
be
still
;
do
n't
struggle
so
,
like
a
wild
frantic
bird
that
is
*NL*
rending
its
own
plumage
in
its
desperation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
no
bird
;
and
no
net
ensnares
me
;
I
am
a
free
human
being
with
an
*NL*
independent
will
,
which
I
now
exert
to
leave
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Another
effort
set
me
at
liberty
,
and
I
stood
erect
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
your
will
shall
decide
your
destiny
,
''
he
said
:
``
I
offer
you
my
hand
,
*NL*
my
heart
,
and
a
share
of
all
my
possessions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
play
a
farce
,
which
I
merely
laugh
at
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ask
you
to
pass
through
life
at
my
side
--
to
be
my
second
self
,
and
*NL*
best
earthly
companion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
that
fate
you
have
already
made
your
choice
,
and
must
abide
by
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jane
,
be
still
a
few
moments
:
you
are
over-excited
:
I
will
be
still
*NL*
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
waft
of
wind
came
sweeping
down
the
laurel-walk
,
and
trembled
through
*NL*
the
boughs
of
the
chestnut
:
it
wandered
away
--
away
--
to
an
indefinite
*NL*
distance
--
it
died
.
The
nightingale
's
song
was
then
the
only
voice
of
the
*NL*
hour
:
in
listening
to
it
,
I
again
wept
.
Mr.
Rochester
sat
quiet
,
looking
*NL*
at
me
gently
and
seriously
.
Some
time
passed
before
he
spoke
;
he
at
last
*NL*
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
to
my
side
,
Jane
,
and
let
us
explain
and
understand
one
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
never
again
come
to
your
side
:
I
am
torn
away
now
,
and
can
not
*NL*
return
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Jane
,
I
summon
you
as
my
wife
:
it
is
you
only
I
intend
to
marry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
silent
:
I
thought
he
mocked
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
Jane
--
come
hither
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
bride
stands
between
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
rose
,
and
with
a
stride
reached
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
bride
is
here
,
''
he
said
,
again
drawing
me
to
him
,
``
because
my
equal
*NL*
is
here
,
and
my
likeness
.
Jane
,
will
you
marry
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Still
I
did
not
answer
,
and
still
I
writhed
myself
from
his
grasp
:
for
I
*NL*
was
still
incredulous
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
doubt
me
,
Jane
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Entirely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
no
faith
in
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
whit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Am
I
a
liar
in
your
eyes
?
''
he
asked
passionately
.
``
Little
sceptic
,
you
*NL*
_
shall
_
be
convinced
.
What
love
have
I
for
Miss
Ingram
?
None
:
and
that
*NL*
you
know
.
What
love
has
she
for
me
?
None
:
as
I
have
taken
pains
to
*NL*
prove
:
I
caused
a
rumour
to
reach
her
that
my
fortune
was
not
a
third
of
*NL*
what
was
supposed
,
and
after
that
I
presented
myself
to
see
the
result
;
*NL*
it
was
coldness
both
from
her
and
her
mother
.
I
would
not
--
I
could
*NL*
not
--
marry
Miss
Ingram
.
You
--
you
strange
,
you
almost
unearthly
thing
!
--
I
*NL*
love
as
my
own
flesh
.
You
--
poor
and
obscure
,
and
small
and
plain
as
you
*NL*
are
--
I
entreat
to
accept
me
as
a
husband
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
me
!
''
I
ejaculated
,
beginning
in
his
earnestness
--
and
especially
in
*NL*
his
incivility
--
to
credit
his
sincerity
:
``
me
who
have
not
a
friend
in
the
*NL*
world
but
you
--
if
you
are
my
friend
:
not
a
shilling
but
what
you
have
*NL*
given
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
,
Jane
,
I
must
have
you
for
my
own
--
entirely
my
own
.
Will
you
be
*NL*
mine
?
Say
yes
,
quickly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Rochester
,
let
me
look
at
your
face
:
turn
to
the
moonlight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
want
to
read
your
countenance
--
turn
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
!
you
will
find
it
scarcely
more
legible
than
a
crumpled
,
scratched
*NL*
page
.
Read
on
:
only
make
haste
,
for
I
suffer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
face
was
very
much
agitated
and
very
much
flushed
,
and
there
were
*NL*
strong
workings
in
the
features
,
and
strange
gleams
in
the
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Jane
,
you
torture
me
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
``
With
that
searching
and
yet
*NL*
faithful
and
generous
look
,
you
torture
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
I
do
that
?
If
you
are
true
,
and
your
offer
real
,
my
only
*NL*
feelings
to
you
must
be
gratitude
and
devotion
--
they
can
not
torture
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gratitude
!
''
he
ejaculated
;
and
added
wildly
--
``
Jane
accept
me
quickly
.
*NL*
Say
,
Edward
--
give
me
my
name
--
Edward
--
I
will
marry
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
in

Do
you
truly
love
me

Do
you
sincerely
wish
me
to
*NL*
be

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
;
and
if
an
oath
is
necessary
to
satisfy
you
,
I
swear
it
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,

I
will
marry
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Edward

my

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
Edward
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
to
me
--
come
to
me
entirely
now
,
''
said
he
;
and
added
,
in
his
deepest
*NL*
tone
,
speaking
in
my
ear
as
his
cheek
was
laid
on
mine
,
``
Make
my
*NL*
happiness
--
I
will
make
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
pardon
me
!
''
he
subjoined
ere
long
;
``
and
man
meddle
not
with
me
:
I
*NL*
have
her
,
and
will
hold
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
one
to
meddle
,
sir
.
I
have
no
kindred
to
interfere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
that
is
the
best
of
it
,
''
he
said
.
And
if
I
had
loved
him
less
I
*NL*
should
have
thought
his
accent
and
look
of
exultation
savage
;
but
,
*NL*
sitting
by
him
,
roused
from
the
nightmare
of
parting
--
called
to
the
*NL*
paradise
of
union
--
I
thought
only
of
the
bliss
given
me
to
drink
in
so
*NL*
abundant
a
flow
.
Again
and
again
he
said
,
``
Are
you
happy
,
Jane
?
''
And
*NL*
again
and
again
I
answered
,
``
Yes
.
''
After
which
he
murmured
,
``
It
will
*NL*
atone
--
it
will
atone
.
Have
I
not
found
her
friendless
,
and
cold
,
and
*NL*
comfortless
?
Will
I
not
guard
,
and
cherish
,
and
solace
her
?
Is
there
*NL*
not
love
in
my
heart
,
and
constancy
in
my
resolves
?
It
will
expiate
at
*NL*
God
's
tribunal
.
I
know
my
Maker
sanctions
what
I
do
.
For
the
world
's
*NL*
judgment
--
I
wash
my
hands
thereof
.
For
man
's
opinion
--
I
defy
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
what
had
befallen
the
night
?
The
moon
was
not
yet
set
,
and
we
were
*NL*
all
in
shadow
:
I
could
scarcely
see
my
master
's
face
,
near
as
I
was
.
And
*NL*
what
ailed
the
chestnut
tree
?
it
writhed
and
groaned
;
while
wind
roared
*NL*
in
the
laurel
walk
,
and
came
sweeping
over
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
go
in
,
''
said
Mr.
Rochester
:
``
the
weather
changes
.
I
could
have
*NL*
sat
with
thee
till
morning
,
Jane
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
,
''
thought
I
,
``
could
I
with
you
.
''
I
should
have
said
so
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
but
a
livid
,
vivid
spark
leapt
out
of
a
cloud
at
which
I
was
looking
,
and
*NL*
there
was
a
crack
,
a
crash
,
and
a
close
rattling
peal
;
and
I
thought
only
*NL*
of
hiding
my
dazzled
eyes
against
Mr.
Rochester
's
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rain
rushed
down
.
He
hurried
me
up
the
walk
,
through
the
grounds
,
*NL*
and
into
the
house
;
but
we
were
quite
wet
before
we
could
pass
the
*NL*
threshold
.
He
was
taking
off
my
shawl
in
the
hall
,
and
shaking
the
water
*NL*
out
of
my
loosened
hair
,
when
Mrs.
Fairfax
emerged
from
her
room
.
I
did
*NL*
not
observe
her
at
first
,
nor
did
Mr.
Rochester
.
The
lamp
was
lit
.
The
*NL*
clock
was
on
the
stroke
of
twelve
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hasten
to
take
off
your
wet
things
,
''
said
he
;
``
and
before
you
go
,
good
-
*NL*
night
--
good-night
,
my
darling
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
kissed
me
repeatedly
.
When
I
looked
up
,
on
leaving
his
arms
,
there
*NL*
stood
the
widow
,
pale
,
grave
,
and
amazed
.
I
only
smiled
at
her
,
and
ran
*NL*
upstairs
.
``
Explanation
will
do
for
another
time
,
''
thought
I.
Still
,
*NL*
when
I
reached
my
chamber
,
I
felt
a
pang
at
the
idea
she
should
even
*NL*
temporarily
misconstrue
what
she
had
seen
.
But
joy
soon
effaced
every
*NL*
other
feeling
;
and
loud
as
the
wind
blew
,
near
and
deep
as
the
thunder
*NL*
crashed
,
fierce
and
frequent
as
the
lightning
gleamed
,
cataract-like
as
*NL*
the
rain
fell
during
a
storm
of
two
hours
'
duration
,
I
experienced
no
*NL*
fear
and
little
awe
.
Mr.
Rochester
came
thrice
to
my
door
in
the
course
*NL*
of
it
,
to
ask
if
I
was
safe
and
tranquil
:
and
that
was
comfort
,
that
was
*NL*
strength
for
anything
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
I
left
my
bed
in
the
morning
,
little
Adele
came
running
in
to
tell
*NL*
me
that
the
great
horse-chestnut
at
the
bottom
of
the
orchard
had
been
*NL*
struck
by
lightning
in
the
night
,
and
half
of
it
split
away
.

CHAPTER
XXIV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
rose
and
dressed
,
I
thought
over
what
had
happened
,
and
wondered
if
*NL*
it
were
a
dream
.
I
could
not
be
certain
of
the
reality
till
I
had
seen
*NL*
Mr.
Rochester
again
,
and
heard
him
renew
his
words
of
love
and
promise
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
arranging
my
hair
,
I
looked
at
my
face
in
the
glass
,
and
felt
it
*NL*
was
no
longer
plain
:
there
was
hope
in
its
aspect
and
life
in
its
colour
;
*NL*
and
my
eyes
seemed
as
if
they
had
beheld
the
fount
of
fruition
,
and
*NL*
borrowed
beams
from
the
lustrous
ripple
.
I
had
often
been
unwilling
to
*NL*
look
at
my
master
,
because
I
feared
he
could
not
be
pleased
at
my
look
;
*NL*
but
I
was
sure
I
might
lift
my
face
to
his
now
,
and
not
cool
his
*NL*
affection
by
its
expression
.
I
took
a
plain
but
clean
and
light
summer
*NL*
dress
from
my
drawer
and
put
it
on
:
it
seemed
no
attire
had
ever
so
well
*NL*
become
me
,
because
none
had
I
ever
worn
in
so
blissful
a
mood
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
not
surprised
,
when
I
ran
down
into
the
hall
,
to
see
that
a
*NL*
brilliant
June
morning
had
succeeded
to
the
tempest
of
the
night
;
and
to
*NL*
feel
,
through
the
open
glass
door
,
the
breathing
of
a
fresh
and
fragrant
*NL*
breeze
.
Nature
must
be
gladsome
when
I
was
so
happy
.
A
beggar-woman
and
*NL*
her
little
boy
--
pale
,
ragged
objects
both
--
were
coming
up
the
walk
,
and
I
*NL*
ran
down
and
gave
them
all
the
money
I
happened
to
have
in
my
purse
--
some
*NL*
three
or
four
shillings
:
good
or
bad
,
they
must
partake
of
my
jubilee
.
*NL*
The
rooks
cawed
,
and
blither
birds
sang
;
but
nothing
was
so
merry
or
so
*NL*
musical
as
my
own
rejoicing
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Fairfax
surprised
me
by
looking
out
of
the
window
with
a
sad
*NL*
countenance
,
and
saying
gravely
--
``
Miss
Eyre
,
will
you
come
to
breakfast
?
''
*NL*
During
the
meal
she
was
quiet
and
cool
:
but
I
could
not
undeceive
her
*NL*
then
.
I
must
wait
for
my
master
to
give
explanations
;
and
so
must
she
.
I
*NL*
ate
what
I
could
,
and
then
I
hastened
upstairs
.
I
met
Adele
leaving
the
*NL*
schoolroom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
you
going
?
It
is
time
for
lessons
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Rochester
has
sent
me
away
to
the
nursery
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
there
,
''
pointing
to
the
apartment
she
had
left
;
and
I
went
in
,
and
*NL*
there
he
stood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
and
bid
me
good-morning
,
''
said
he
.
I
gladly
advanced
;
and
it
was
*NL*
not
merely
a
cold
word
now
,
or
even
a
shake
of
the
hand
that
I
received
,
*NL*
but
an
embrace
and
a
kiss
.
It
seemed
natural

he
*NL*
continued
,
``
even
although
I
should
make
you
a
little
indignant

I
have
seen
what
a
fire-spirit
you
can
be
when
you
are
indignant

You
*NL*
glowed
in
the
cool
moonlight
last
night
,
when
you
mutinied
against
fate

*NL*
and
claimed
your
rank
as
my
equal

by-the-bye

it
was
you

made
me
the

*NL*

Of

Ingram

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
feigned
courtship
of
Miss
Ingram
,
because
I
wished
to
render
you
*NL*
as
madly
in
love
with
me
as
I
was
with
you

and
I
knew
jealousy
would
be
*NL*
the
best
ally
I

the
furtherance

that

*NL*
``
Excellent

Now
you
are
small

not
one

little

It
was
a
burning
shame

a
scandalous
disgrace
to
act
*NL*
in

way

Did
you
think
nothing
of
Miss
Ingram

feelings

*NL*
*NL*

Her
feelings
are
concentrated

*NL*
*NL*
``
Never

Mr.
Rochester

it
is
in
no

interesting
to

that

me
truly
once
more

Do
you
think
Miss
Ingram
will
not
*NL*
suffer
from
your
dishonest
coquetry

forsaken

*NL*
*NL*
``
Impossible

when
I
told
you
how
she

on

deserted
me
:
the
*NL*
idea

my
insolvency
cooled
,

rather
extinguished
,
her
flame
in
a
*NL*
moment

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
a
curious

designing
mind

eccentric

*NL*

Once

*NL*
*NL*
I
turned
my

to

I
loved

more
than
I

more
than
words
had
power

*NL*
``

said
presently
;

it
is
my

entreated

to
yield

*NL*
*NL*
I
was
again
ready
with
my
request

``
Communicate
your

she
saw
me
with

last
night
in

and
she
was
*NL*
shocked

Give
her
some
explanation
before
I

her
again

It
pains
me
*NL*
to
be
misjudged
by
so
good
a
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
to
your
room
,

put
on
your

he
replied
.
``
I

accompany
me
to
Millcote
this
morning
;
and
while
you
prepare
for
the
*NL*
drive
,
I
will
enlighten
the
old
lady
's
understanding
.
Did
she
think
,
*NL*
Janet
,
you
had
given
the
world
for
love
,

considered
it
well
lost
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe

*NL*
*NL*
``
Station

station

your
station

those
who
would
insult
you
,
now
or
hereafter
.
--
Go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
soon
dressed
;
and
when
I
heard
Mr.
Rochester
quit
Mrs.
Fairfax
's
*NL*
parlour
,
I
hurried
down
to
it
.
The
old
lady
,
had
been
reading
her
*NL*
morning
portion
of
Scripture
--
the
Lesson
for
the
day
;
her
Bible
lay
open
*NL*
before
her
,
and
her
spectacles
were
upon
it
.
Her
occupation
,
suspended
*NL*
by
Mr.
Rochester
's
announcement
,
seemed
now
forgotten
:
her
eyes
,
fixed
on
*NL*
the
blank
wall
opposite
,
expressed
the
surprise
of
a
quiet
mind
stirred
*NL*
by
unwonted
tidings
.
Seeing
me
,
she
roused
herself
:
she
made
a
sort
of
*NL*
effort
to
smile
,
and
framed
a
few
words
of
congratulation
;
but
the
smile
*NL*
expired
,
and
the
sentence
was
abandoned
unfinished
.
She
put
up
her
*NL*
spectacles
,
shut
the
Bible
,
and
pushed
her
chair
back
from
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
feel
so
astonished
,
''
she
began
,
``
I
hardly
know
what
to
say
to
you
,
*NL*
Miss
Eyre
.
I
have
surely
not
been
dreaming
,
have
I
?
Sometimes
I
half
*NL*
fall
asleep
when
I
am
sitting
alone
and
fancy
things
that
have
never
*NL*
happened
.
It
has
seemed
to
me
more
than
once
when
I
have
been
in
a
doze
,
*NL*
that
my
dear
husband
,
who
died
fifteen
years
since
,
has
come
in
and
sat
*NL*
down
beside
me
;
and
that
I
have
even
heard
him
call
me
by
my
name
,
Alice
,
*NL*
as
he
used
to
do
.
Now
,
can
you
tell
me
whether
it
is
actually
true
that
*NL*
Mr.
Rochester
has
asked
you
to
marry
him
?
Do
n't
laugh
at
me
.
But
I
*NL*
really
thought
he
came
in
here
five
minutes
ago
,
and
said
that
in
a
month
*NL*
you
would
be
his
wife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
said
the
same
thing
to
me
,
''
I
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
!
Do
you
believe
him
?
Have
you
accepted
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
me
bewildered
.
``
I
could
never
have
thought
it
.
He
is
a
*NL*
proud
man
:
all
the
Rochesters
were
proud
:
and
his
father
,
at
least
,
liked
*NL*
money
.
He
,
too
,
has
always
been
called
careful
.
He
means
to
marry
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
tells
me
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
surveyed
my
whole
person
:
in
her
eyes
I
read
that
they
had
there
*NL*
found
no
charm
powerful
enough
to
solve
the
enigma
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
passes
me
!
''
she
continued
;
``
but
no
doubt
,
it
is
true
since
you
say
*NL*
so
.
How
it
will
answer
,
I
can
not
tell
:
I
really
do
n't
know
.
Equality
of
*NL*
position
and
fortune
is
often
advisable
in
such
cases
;
and
there
are
*NL*
twenty
years
of
difference
in
your
ages
.
He
might
almost
be
your
*NL*
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
indeed
,
Mrs.
Fairfax
!
''
exclaimed
I
,
nettled
;
``
he
is
nothing
like
my
*NL*
father
!
No
one
,
who
saw
us
together
,
would
suppose
it
for
an
instant
.
*NL*
Mr.
Rochester
looks
as
young
,
and
is
as
young
,
as
some
men
at
five-and
-
*NL*
twenty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
really
for
love
he
is
going
to
marry
you
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
so
hurt
by
her
coldness
and
scepticism
,
that
the
tears
rose
to
my
*NL*
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
to
grieve
you
,
''
pursued
the
widow
;
``
but
you
are
so
young
,
and
*NL*
so
little
acquainted
with
men
,
I
wished
to
put
you
on
your
guard
.
It
is
*NL*
an
old
saying
that
`
all
is
not
gold
that
glitters
;
'
and
in
this
case
I
do
*NL*
fear
there
will
be
something
found
to
be
different
to
what
either
you
or
*NL*
I
expect
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
--
am
I
a
monster
?
''
I
said
:
``
is
it
impossible
that
Mr.
Rochester
*NL*
should
have
a
sincere
affection
for
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
:
you
are
very
well
;
and
much
improved
of
late
;
and
Mr.
Rochester
,
I
*NL*
daresay
,
is
fond
of
you
.
I
have
always
noticed
that
you
were
a
sort
of
*NL*
pet
of
his
.
There
are
times
when
,
for
your
sake
,
I
have
been
a
little
*NL*
uneasy
at
his
marked
preference
,
and
have
wished
to
put
you
on
your
*NL*
guard
:
but
I
did
not
like
to
suggest
even
the
possibility
of
wrong
.
I
*NL*
knew
such
an
idea
would
shock
,
perhaps
offend
you
;
and
you
were
so
*NL*
discreet
,
and
so
thoroughly
modest
and
sensible
,
I
hoped
you
might
be
*NL*
trusted
to
protect
yourself
.
Last
night
I
can
not
tell
you
what
I
*NL*
suffered
when
I
sought
all
over
the
house
,
and
could
find
you
nowhere
,
*NL*
nor
the
master
either
;
and
then
,
at
twelve
o'clock
,
saw
you
come
in
with
*NL*
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
never
mind
that
now
,
''
I
interrupted
impatiently
;
``
it
is
enough
*NL*
that
all
was
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
all
will
be
right
in
the
end
,
''
she
said
:
``
but
believe
me
,
you
*NL*
can
not
be
too
careful

Try
and
keep
Mr.
Rochester
at
a
distance
:
*NL*
distrust
yourself
as
well
as
him
.
Gentlemen
in
his
station
are
not
*NL*
accustomed
to
marry
their
governesses

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
growing
truly
irritated
:
happily
,
Adele
ran
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
go

let
me
go
to
Millcote
too

she
cried

``
Mr.

so
much
room

me
go

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
will
,
Adele
;
''
and
I
hastened
away
with
her
,
glad
to
quit
my
*NL*
gloomy
monitress
.
The
carriage
was
ready
:
they
were
bringing
it
round
to
*NL*
the
front
,
and
my
master
was
pacing
the
pavement
,
Pilot
following
him
*NL*
backwards
and
forwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Adele
may
accompany
us
,
may
she
not

sir

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
her
no

I
'll

you

*NL*
*NL*
``

better

``
Not
it

she
will

*NL*
*NL*
He
was
quite
peremptory
,
both
in
look
and
voice
.
The
chill
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Fairfax
's
warnings
,
and
the
damp
of
her
doubts
were
upon
me
:
something
of
*NL*
unsubstantiality
and
uncertainty
had
beset
my
hopes
.
I
half
lost
the
*NL*
sense
of
power
over
him
.
I
was
about
mechanically
to
obey
him
,
without
*NL*
further
remonstrance
;
but
as
he
helped
me
into
the
carriage
,
he
looked
at
*NL*
my
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
?
''
he
asked
;
``
all
the
sunshine
is
gone

Do
you
really
*NL*
wish
the
bairn
to
go

Will
it
annoy
you
if

is
left
behind

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
far
rather
she
went

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
off
for
your
bonnet

and
back
like
a
flash
of
lightning
!

cried
he
*NL*
to
Adele
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
obeyed
him
with
what
speed
she
might
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
all
,
a
single
morning
's
interruption
will
not
matter
much
,
''
said
*NL*
he
,
``
when
I
mean
shortly
to
claim
you

your
thoughts

conversation
,
and
*NL*
company

for
life

''
*NL*
*NL*
Adele
,
when
lifted
in
,
commenced
kissing
me
,
by
way
of
expressing
her
*NL*
gratitude
for
my
intercession
:
she
was
instantly
stowed
away
into
a
*NL*
corner
on
the
other
side
of
him
.
She
then
peeped
round
to
where
I
sat
;
*NL*
so
stern
a
neighbour
was
too
restrictive
to
him
,
in
his
present
fractious
*NL*
mood
,
she
dared
whisper
no
observations
,
nor
ask
of
him
any
information
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
her
come
to
me
,
''
I
entreated
:
``
she
will
,
perhaps
,
trouble
you

sir
:
*NL*
there
is
plenty
of
room
on
this
side

*NL*
*NL*
He
handed
her
over
as
if
she
had
been
a
lapdog
.
``
I
'll
send
her
to
school
*NL*
yet

he
said
,
but
now
he
was
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Adele
heard
him
,
and
asked
if
she
was
to
go
to
school
``
sans
*NL*
mademoiselle
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
replied
,
``
absolutely
sans

I
am
to
take

there

a
cave

observed
Adele

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
gather
manna

with
manna

*NL*
*NL*
``
She
will
want

*NL*
*NL*
``

Mr.
Rochester
professed
to
be
puzzled

said
he
.
``
What

you

could
cut
a
pretty
*NL*
enough
scarf
out
of
a
rainbow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
far
better
as
she
is
,
''
concluded
Adele
,
after
musing
some
time
:
*NL*
``
besides
,
she
would
get
tired
of
living
with
only
you
in
the
moon
.
If
I
*NL*
were
mademoiselle
,
I
would
never
consent
to
go
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
consented
:
she
has
pledged
her
word

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
ca
n't
get
her
there
;
there
is
no
road
to
the

it

all
*NL*
air
;
and
neither
you
nor
she
can
fly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Adele
,
look
at
that
field
.
''
We
were
now
outside
Thornfield
gates
,
and
*NL*
bowling
lightly
along
the
smooth
road
to
Millcote
,
where
the
dust
was
*NL*
well
laid
by
the
thunderstorm
,
and
,
where
the
low
hedges
and
lofty
timber
*NL*
trees
on
each
side
glistened
green
and
rain-refreshed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
that
field
,
Adele
,
I
was
walking
late
one
evening
about
a
fortnight
*NL*
since
--
the
evening
of
the
day
you
helped
me
to
make
hay
in
the
orchard
*NL*
meadows
;
and
,
as
I
was
tired
with
raking
swaths
,
I
sat
down
to
rest
me
on
*NL*
a
stile
;
and
there
I
took
out
a
little
book
and
a
pencil
,
and
began
to
*NL*
write
about
a
misfortune
that
befell
me
long
ago
,
and
a
wish
I
had
for
*NL*
happy
days
to
come
:
I
was
writing
away
very
fast
,
though
daylight
was
*NL*
fading
from
the
leaf
,
when
something
came
up
the
path
and
stopped
two
*NL*
yards
off
me
.
I
looked
at
it
.
It
was
a
little
thing
with
a
veil
of
*NL*
gossamer
on
its
head
.
I
beckoned
it
to
come
near
me
;
it
stood
soon
at
my
*NL*
knee
.
I
never
spoke
to
it
,
and
it
never
spoke
to
me
,
in
words
;
but
I
*NL*
read
its
eyes
,
and
it
read
mine
;
and
our
speechless
colloquy
was
to
this
*NL*
effect
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a
fairy
,
and
come
from
Elf-land
,
it
said
;
and
its
errand
was
to
*NL*
make
me
happy
:
I
must
go
with
it
out
of
the
common
world
to
a
lonely
*NL*
place
--
such
as
the
moon
,
for
instance
--
and
it
nodded
its
head
towards
her
*NL*
horn
,
rising
over
Hay-hill
:
it
told
me
of
the
alabaster
cave
and
silver
*NL*
vale
where
we
might
live
.
I
said
I
should
like
to
go
;
but
reminded
it
,
*NL*
as
you
did
me
,
that
I
had
no
wings
to
fly
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Oh
,
'
returned
the
fairy
,
`
that
does
not
signify
!
Here
is
a
talisman
*NL*
will
remove
all
difficulties
;
'
and
she
held
out
a
pretty
gold
ring
.
`
Put
*NL*
it
,
'
she
said
,
`
on
the
fourth
finger
of
my
left
hand
,
and
I
am
yours
,
and
*NL*
you
are
mine
;
and
we
shall
leave
earth
,
and
make
our
own
heaven
yonder
.
'
*NL*
She
nodded
again
at
the
moon
.
The
ring
,
Adele
,
is
in
my
breeches-pocket
,
*NL*
under
the
disguise
of
a
sovereign
:
but
I
mean
soon
to
change
it
to
a
ring
*NL*
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
has
mademoiselle
to
do
with
it
?
I
do
n't
care
for
the
fairy
:
*NL*
you
said
it
was
mademoiselle
you
would
take
to
the
moon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mademoiselle
is
a
fairy
,
''
he
said
,
whispering
mysteriously
.
Whereupon
I
*NL*
told
her
not
to
mind
his
badinage
;
and
she
,
on
her
part
,
evinced
a
fund
*NL*
of
genuine
French
scepticism
:
denominating
Mr.
Rochester
``
un
vrai
*NL*
menteur
,
''
and
assuring
him
that
she
made
no
account
whatever
of
his
*NL*
``
contes
de
fee
,
''
and
that
``
du
reste
,
il
n
'
y
avait
pas
de
fees
,
et
quand
*NL*
meme
il
y
en
avait
:
''
she
was
sure
they
would
never
appear
to
him
,
nor
*NL*
ever
give
him
rings
,
or
offer
to
live
with
him
in
the
moon
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hour
spent
at
Millcote
was
a
somewhat
harassing
one
to
me
.
Mr.
*NL*
Rochester
obliged
me
to
go
to
a
certain
silk
warehouse
:
there
I
was
*NL*
ordered
to
choose
half-a-dozen
dresses
.
I
hated
the
business
,
I
begged
*NL*
leave
to
defer
it
:
no
--
it
should
be
gone
through
with
now
.
By
dint
of
*NL*
entreaties
expressed
in
energetic
whispers
,
I
reduced
the
half-dozen
to
*NL*
two
:
these
however
,
he
vowed
he
would
select
himself
.
With
anxiety
I
*NL*
watched
his
eye
rove
over
the
gay
stores
:
he
fixed
on
a
rich
silk
of
the
*NL*
most
brilliant
amethyst
dye
,
and
a
superb
pink
satin
.
I
told
him
in
a
*NL*
new
series
of
whispers
,
that
he
might
as
well
buy
me
a
gold
gown
and
a
*NL*
silver
bonnet
at
once
:
I
should
certainly
never
venture
to
wear
his
*NL*
choice
.
With
infinite
difficulty
,
for
he
was
stubborn
as
a
stone
,
I
*NL*
persuaded
him
to
make
an
exchange
in
favour
of
a
sober
black
satin
and
*NL*
pearl-grey
silk
.
``
It
might
pass
for
the
present
,
''
he
said
;
``
but
he
would
*NL*
yet
see
me
glittering
like
a
parterre
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Glad
was
I
to
get
him
out
of
the
silk
warehouse
,
and
then
out
of
a
*NL*
jewellers
shop
:
the
more
he
bought
me
,
the
more
my
cheek
burned
with
a
*NL*
sense
of
annoyance
and
degradation
.
As
we
re-entered
the
carriage
,
and
I
*NL*
sat
back
feverish
and
fagged
,
I
remembered
what
,
in
the
hurry
of
events
,
*NL*
dark
and
bright
,
I
had
wholly
forgotten
--
the
letter
of
my
uncle
,
John
*NL*
Eyre
,
to
Mrs.
Reed
:
his
intention
to
adopt
me
and
make
me
his
legatee
.
*NL*
``
It
would
,
indeed
,
be
a
relief
,
''
I
thought
,
``
if
I
had
ever
so
small
an
*NL*
independency
;
I
never
can
bear
being
dressed
like
a
doll
by
Mr.
*NL*
Rochester
,
or
sitting
like
a
second
Danae
with
the
golden
shower
falling
*NL*
daily
round
me
.
I
will
write
to
Madeira
the
moment
I
get
home
,
and
tell
*NL*
my
uncle
John
I
am
going
to
be
married
,
and
to
whom
:
if
I
had
but
a
*NL*
prospect
of
one
day
bringing
Mr.
Rochester
an
accession
of
fortune
,
I
*NL*
could
better
endure
to
be
kept
by
him
now
.
''
And
somewhat
relieved
by
*NL*
this
idea
-LRB-
which
I
failed
not
to
execute
that
day
-RRB-
,
I
ventured
once
more
*NL*
to
meet
my
master
's
and
lover
's
eye
,
which
most
pertinaciously
sought
*NL*
mine
,
though
I
averted
both
face
and
gaze
.
He
smiled
;
and
I
thought
his
*NL*
smile
was
such
as
a
sultan
might
,
in
a
blissful
and
fond
moment
,
bestow
*NL*
on
a
slave
his
gold
and
gems
had
enriched
:
I
crushed
his
hand
,
which
was
*NL*
ever
hunting
mine
,
vigorously
,
and
thrust
it
back
to
him
red
with
the
*NL*
passionate
pressure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
need
not
look
in
that
way
,
''
I
said
;
``
if
you
do
,
I
'll
wear
nothing
*NL*
but
my
old
Lowood
frocks
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
.
I
'll
be
married
in
*NL*
this
lilac
gingham
:
you
may
make
a
dressing-gown
for
yourself
out
of
the
*NL*
pearl-grey
silk
,
and
an
infinite
series
of
waistcoats
out
of
the
black
*NL*
satin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
chuckled
;
he
rubbed
his
hands
.
``
Oh
,
it
is
rich
to
see
and
hear
her
?
''
*NL*
he
exclaimed
.
``
Is
she
original
?
Is
she
piquant
?
I
would
not
exchange
*NL*
this
one
little
English
girl
for
the
Grand
Turk
's
whole
seraglio
,
gazelle
-
*NL*
eyes
,
houri
forms
,
and
all
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Eastern
allusion
bit
me
again
.
``
I
'll
not
stand
you
an
inch
in
the
*NL*
stead
of
a
seraglio
,
''
I
said
;
``
so
do
n't
consider
me
an
equivalent
for
*NL*
one

a
fancy
for
anything

line

away
with
you

bazaars

Stamboul

lifted
out
Adele

I
entered

made
good
my

retreat
upstairs

*NL*
He
duly
summoned
me
to
his
presence
in
the
evening
.
I
had
prepared
an
*NL*
occupation
for
him
;
for
I
was
determined
not
to
spend
the
whole
time
in
a
*NL*
_
tete-a-tete
_
conversation

I
remembered
his
fine
voice
;
I
knew
he
liked
*NL*
to
sing
--
good
singers
generally
do
.
I
was
no
vocalist
myself
,
and
,
in
*NL*
his
fastidious
judgment
,
no
musician
,
either
;
but
I
delighted
in
*NL*
listening
when
the
performance
was
good
.
No
sooner
had
twilight
,
that
*NL*
hour
of
romance
,
began
to
lower
her
blue
and
starry
banner
over
the
*NL*
lattice
,
than
I
rose
,
opened
the
piano
,
and
entreated
him
,
for
the
love
*NL*
of
heaven
,
to
give
me
a
song
.
He
said
I
was
a
capricious
witch
,
and
that
*NL*
he
would
rather
sing
another
time
;
but
I
averred
that
no
time
was
like
*NL*
the
present
.

``
Did
I
like
his
voice
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
much
.
''
I
was
not
fond
of
pampering
that
susceptible
vanity
of
his
;
*NL*
but
for
once
,
and
from
motives
of
expediency
,
I
would
e
`
en
soothe
and
*NL*
stimulate
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
Jane
,
you
must
play
the
accompaniment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
sir
,
I
will
try
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
try
,
but
was
presently
swept
off
the
stool
and
denominated
``
a
*NL*
little
bungler
.
''
Being
pushed
unceremoniously
to
one
side
--
which
was
*NL*
precisely
what
I
wished
--
he
usurped
my
place
,
and
proceeded
to
accompany
*NL*
himself
:
for
he
could
play
as
well
as
sing
.
I
hied
me
to
the
*NL*
window-recess
.
And
while
I
sat
there
and
looked
out
on
the
still
trees
*NL*
and
dim
lawn
,
to
a
sweet
air
was
sung
in
mellow
tones
the
following
*NL*
strain
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
truest
love
that
ever
heart
*NL*
Felt
at
its
kindled
core
,
*NL*
Did
through
each
vein
,
in
quickened
start
,
*NL*
The
tide
of
being
pour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
coming
was
my
hope
each
day
,
*NL*
Her
parting
was
my
pain
;
*NL*
The
chance
that
did
her
steps
delay
*NL*
Was
ice
in
every
vein
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
dreamed
it
would
be
nameless
bliss
,
*NL*
As
I
loved
,
loved
to
be
;
*NL*
And
to
this
object
did
I
press
*NL*
As
blind
as
eagerly
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
wide
as
pathless
was
the
space
*NL*
That
lay
our
lives
between
,
*NL*
And
dangerous
as
the
foamy
race
*NL*
Of
ocean-surges
green
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
haunted
as
a
robber-path
*NL*
Through
wilderness
or
wood
;
*NL*
For
Might
and
Right
,
and
Woe
and
Wrath
,
*NL*
Between
our
spirits
stood
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
dangers
dared
;
I
hindrance
scorned
;
*NL*
I
omens
did
defy
:
*NL*
Whatever
menaced
,
harassed
,
warned
,
*NL*
I
passed
impetuous
by
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
sped
my
rainbow
,
fast
as
light
;
*NL*
I
flew
as
in
a
dream
;
*NL*
For
glorious
rose
upon
my
sight
*NL*
That
child
of
Shower
and
Gleam
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
bright
on
clouds
of
suffering
dim
*NL*
Shines
that
soft
,
solemn
joy
;
*NL*
Nor
care
I
now
,
how
dense
and
grim
*NL*
Disasters
gather
nigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
care
not
in
this
moment
sweet
,
*NL*
Though
all
I
have
rushed
o'er
*NL*
Should
come
on
pinion
,
strong
and
fleet
,
*NL*
Proclaiming
vengeance
sore
:
*NL*
*NL*
Though
haughty
Hate
should
strike
me
down
,
*NL*
Right
,
bar
approach
to
me
,
*NL*
And
grinding
Might
,
with
furious
frown
,
*NL*
Swear
endless
enmity
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
love
has
placed
her
little
hand
*NL*
With
noble
faith
in
mine
,
*NL*
And
vowed
that
wedlock
's
sacred
band
*NL*
Our
nature
shall
entwine
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
love
has
sworn
,
with
sealing
kiss
,
*NL*
With
me
to
live
--
to
die
;
*NL*
I
have
at
last
my
nameless
bliss
.
*NL*
As
I
love
--
loved
am
I
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
rose
and
came
towards
me
,
and
I
saw
his
face
all
kindled
,
and
his
full
*NL*
falcon-eye
flashing
,
and
tenderness
and
passion
in
every
lineament
.
I
*NL*
quailed
momentarily
--
then
I
rallied
.
Soft
scene
,
daring
demonstration
,
I
*NL*
would
not
have
;
and
I
stood
in
peril
of
both
:
a
weapon
of
defence
must
be
*NL*
prepared
--
I
whetted
my
tongue
:
as
he
reached
me
,
I
asked
with
asperity
,
*NL*
``
whom
he
was
going
to
marry
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
a
strange
question
to
be
put
by
his
darling
Jane
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
!
I
considered
it
a
very
natural
and
necessary
one
:
he
had
talked
*NL*
of
his
future
wife
dying
with
him
.
What
did
he
mean
by
such
a
pagan
*NL*
idea
?
_
I
_
had
no
intention
of
dying
with
him
--
he
might
depend
on
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
all
he
longed
,
all
he
prayed
for
,
was
that
I
might
live
with
him
!
*NL*
Death
was
not
for
such
as
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
it
was
:
I
had
as
good
a
right
to
die
when
my
time
came
as
he
had
:
*NL*
but
I
should
bide
that
time
,
and
not
be
hurried
away
in
a
suttee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
I
forgive
him
for
the
selfish
idea
,
and
prove
my
pardon
by
a
*NL*
reconciling
kiss
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
:
I
would
rather
be
excused
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
I
heard
myself
apostrophised
as
a
``
hard
little
thing
;
''
and
it
was
*NL*
added
,
``
any
other
woman
would
have
been
melted
to
marrow
at
hearing
such
*NL*
stanzas
crooned
in
her
praise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
assured
him
I
was
naturally
hard
--
very
flinty
,
and
that
he
would
often
*NL*
find
me
so
;
and
that
,
moreover
,
I
was
determined
to
show
him
divers
*NL*
rugged
points
in
my
character
before
the
ensuing
four
weeks
elapsed
:
he
*NL*
should
know
fully
what
sort
of
a
bargain
he
had
made
,
while
there
was
yet
*NL*
time
to
rescind
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
I
be
quiet
and
talk
rationally
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
be
quiet
if
he
liked
,
and
as
to
talking
rationally
,
I
flattered
*NL*
myself
I
was
doing
that
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
fretted
,
pished
,
and
pshawed
.
``
Very
good
,
''
I
thought
;
``
you
may
fume
*NL*
and
fidget
as
you
please
:
but
this
is
the
best
plan
to
pursue
with
you
,
I
*NL*
am
certain
.
I
like
you
more
than
I
can
say
;
but
I
'll
not
sink
into
a
*NL*
bathos
of
sentiment
:
and
with
this
needle
of
repartee
I
'll
keep
you
from
*NL*
the
edge
of
the
gulf
too
;
and
,
moreover
,
maintain
by
its
pungent
aid
that
*NL*
distance
between
you
and
myself
most
conducive
to
our
real
mutual
*NL*
advantage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
From
less
to
more
,
I
worked
him
up
to
considerable
irritation
;
then
,
*NL*
after
he
had
retired
,
in
dudgeon
,
quite
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
I
*NL*
got
up
,
and
saying
,
``
I
wish
you
good-night
,
sir
,
''
in
my
natural
and
*NL*
wonted
respectful
manner
,
I
slipped
out
by
the
side-door
and
got
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
system
thus
entered
on
,
I
pursued
during
the
whole
season
of
*NL*
probation
;
and
with
the
best
success
.
He
was
kept
,
to
be
sure
,
rather
*NL*
cross
and
crusty
;
but
on
the
whole
I
could
see
he
was
excellently
*NL*
entertained
,
and
that
a
lamb-like
submission
and
turtle-dove
sensibility
,
*NL*
while
fostering
his
despotism
more
,
would
have
pleased
his
judgment
,
*NL*
satisfied
his
common-sense
,
and
even
suited
his
taste
less
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
other
people
's
presence
I
was
,
as
formerly
,
deferential
and
quiet
;
any
*NL*
other
line
of
conduct
being
uncalled
for
:
it
was
only
in
the
evening
*NL*
conferences
I
thus
thwarted
and
afflicted
him
.
He
continued
to
send
for
*NL*
me
punctually
the
moment
the
clock
struck
seven
;
though
when
I
appeared
*NL*
before
him
now
,
he
had
no
such
honeyed
terms
as
``
love
''
and
``
darling
''
on
*NL*
his
lips
:
the
best
words
at
my
service
were
``
provoking
puppet
,
''
*NL*
``
malicious
elf
,
''
``
sprite
,
''
``
changeling
,
''
&
c.
For
caresses
,
too
,
I
now
*NL*
got
grimaces
;
for
a
pressure
of
the
hand
,
a
pinch
on
the
arm
;
for
a
kiss
*NL*
on
the
cheek
,
a
severe
tweak
of
the
ear
.
It
was
all
right
:
at
present
I
*NL*
decidedly
preferred
these
fierce
favours
to
anything
more
tender
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Fairfax
,
I
saw
,
approved
me
:
her
anxiety
on
my
account
vanished
;
*NL*
therefore
I
was
certain
I
did
well
.
Meantime
,
Mr.
Rochester
affirmed
I
*NL*
was
wearing
him
to
skin
and
bone
,
and
threatened
awful
vengeance
for
my
*NL*
present
conduct
at
some
period
fast
coming
.
I
laughed
in
my
sleeve
at
*NL*
his
menaces
.
``
I
can
keep
you
in
reasonable
check
now
,
''
I
reflected
;
``
and
*NL*
I
do
n't
doubt
to
be
able
to
do
it
hereafter
:
if
one
expedient
loses
its
*NL*
virtue
,
another
must
be
devised
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
after
all
my
task
was
not
an
easy
one
;
often
I
would
rather
have
*NL*
pleased
than
teased
him
.
My
future
husband
was
becoming
to
me
my
whole
*NL*
world
;
and
more
than
the
world
:
almost
my
hope
of
heaven
.
He
stood
*NL*
between
me
and
every
thought
of
religion
,
as
an
eclipse
intervenes
*NL*
between
man
and
the
broad
sun
.
I
could
not
,
in
those
days
,
see
God
for
*NL*
His
creature
:
of
whom
I
had
made
an
idol
.

CHAPTER
XXV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
month
of
courtship
had
wasted
:
its
very
last
hours
were
being
*NL*
numbered
.
There
was
no
putting
off
the
day
that
advanced
--
the
bridal
*NL*
day
;
and
all
preparations
for
its
arrival
were
complete
.
_
I
_
,
at
least
,
*NL*
had
nothing
more
to
do
:
there
were
my
trunks
,
packed
,
locked
,
corded
,
*NL*
ranged
in
a
row
along
the
wall
of
my
little
chamber
;
to-morrow
,
at
this
*NL*
time
,
they
would
be
far
on
their
road
to
London
:
and
so
should
I
*NL*
-LRB-
D.V.
-RRB-
,
--
or
rather
,
not
I
,
but
one
Jane
Rochester
,
a
person
whom
as
yet
I
*NL*
knew
not
.
The
cards
of
address
alone
remained
to
nail
on
:
they
lay
,
four
*NL*
little
squares
,
in
the
drawer
.
Mr.
Rochester
had
himself
written
the
*NL*
direction
,
``
Mrs.
Rochester
,
--
Hotel
,
London
,
''
on
each
:
I
could
not
*NL*
persuade
myself
to
affix
them
,
or
to
have
them
affixed
.
Mrs.
Rochester
!
*NL*
She
did
not
exist
:
she
would
not
be
born
till
to-morrow
,
some
time
after
*NL*
eight
o'clock
a.m.
;
and
I
would
wait
to
be
assured
she
had
come
into
the
*NL*
world
alive
before
I
assigned
to
her
all
that
property
.
It
was
enough
*NL*
that
in
yonder
closet
,
opposite
my
dressing-table
,
garments
said
to
be
*NL*
hers
had
already
displaced
my
black
stuff
Lowood
frock
and
straw
bonnet
:
*NL*
for
not
to
me
appertained
that
suit
of
wedding
raiment
;
the
*NL*
pearl-coloured
robe
,
the
vapoury
veil
pendent
from
the
usurped
*NL*
portmanteau
.
I
shut
the
closet
to
conceal
the
strange
,
wraith-like
*NL*
apparel
it
contained
;
which
,
at
this
evening
hour
--
nine
o'clock
--
gave
out
*NL*
certainly
a
most
ghostly
shimmer
through
the
shadow
of
my
apartment
.
``
I
*NL*
will
leave
you
by
yourself
,
white
dream
,
''
I
said
.
``
I
am
feverish
:
I
hear
*NL*
the
wind
blowing
:
I
will
go
out
of
doors
and
feel
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
only
the
hurry
of
preparation
that
made
me
feverish
;
not
only
*NL*
the
anticipation
of
the
great
change
--
the
new
life
which
was
to
commence
*NL*
to-morrow
:
both
these
circumstances
had
their
share
,
doubtless
,
in
*NL*
producing
that
restless
,
excited
mood
which
hurried
me
forth
at
this
late
*NL*
hour
into
the
darkening
grounds
:
but
a
third
cause
influenced
my
mind
*NL*
more
than
they
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
at
heart
a
strange
and
anxious
thought
.
Something
had
happened
*NL*
which
I
could
not
comprehend
;
no
one
knew
of
or
had
seen
the
event
but
*NL*
myself
:
it
had
taken
place
the
preceding
night
.
Mr.
Rochester
that
night
*NL*
was
absent
from
home
;
nor
was
he
yet
returned
:
business
had
called
him
to
*NL*
a
small
estate
of
two
or
three
farms
he
possessed
thirty
miles
*NL*
off
--
business
it
was
requisite
he
should
settle
in
person
,
previous
to
*NL*
his
meditated
departure
from
England
.
I
waited
now
his
return
;
eager
to
*NL*
disburthen
my
mind
,
and
to
seek
of
him
the
solution
of
the
enigma
that
*NL*
perplexed
me
.
Stay
till
he
comes
,
reader
;
and
,
when
I
disclose
my
secret
*NL*
to
him
,
you
shall
share
the
confidence
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
sought
the
orchard
,
driven
to
its
shelter
by
the
wind
,
which
all
day
*NL*
had
blown
strong
and
full
from
the
south
,
without
,
however
,
bringing
a
*NL*
speck
of
rain
.
Instead
of
subsiding
as
night
drew
on
,
it
seemed
to
*NL*
augment
its
rush
and
deepen
its
roar
:
the
trees
blew
steadfastly
one
way
,
*NL*
never
writhing
round
,
and
scarcely
tossing
back
their
boughs
once
in
an
*NL*
hour
;
so
continuous
was
the
strain
bending
their
branchy
heads
*NL*
northward
--
the
clouds
drifted
from
pole
to
pole
,
fast
following
,
mass
on
*NL*
mass
:
no
glimpse
of
blue
sky
had
been
visible
that
July
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
without
a
certain
wild
pleasure
I
ran
before
the
wind
,
*NL*
delivering
my
trouble
of
mind
to
the
measureless
air-torrent
thundering
*NL*
through
space
.
Descending
the
laurel
walk
,
I
faced
the
wreck
of
the
*NL*
chestnut-tree
;
it
stood
up
black
and
riven
:
the
trunk
,
split
down
the
*NL*
centre
,
gasped
ghastly
.
The
cloven
halves
were
not
broken
from
each
*NL*
other
,
for
the
firm
base
and
strong
roots
kept
them
unsundered
below
;
*NL*
though
community
of
vitality
was
destroyed
--
the
sap
could
flow
no
more
:
*NL*
their
great
boughs
on
each
side
were
dead
,
and
next
winter
's
tempests
*NL*
would
be
sure
to
fell
one
or
both
to
earth
:
as
yet
,
however
,
they
might
*NL*
be
said
to
form
one
tree
--
a
ruin
,
but
an
entire
ruin
.

``
You

to
hold
fast
to
each
other
,
''
I
said
:
as
if
the
monster
-
*NL*
splinters
were
living
things
,
and
could
hear
me
.
``
I
think
,
scathed
as
*NL*
you
look
,
and
charred
and
scorched
,
there
must
be
a
little
sense
of
life
*NL*
in
you
yet
,
rising
out
of
that
adhesion
at
the
faithful
,
honest
roots
:
*NL*
you
will
never
have
green
leaves
more
--
never
more
see
birds
making
nests
*NL*
and
singing
idyls
in
your
boughs
;
the
time
of
pleasure
and
love
is
over
*NL*
with
you
:
but
you
are
not
desolate
:
each
of
you
has
a
comrade
to
*NL*
sympathise
with
him
in
his
decay
.
''
As
I
looked
up
at
them
,
the
moon
*NL*
appeared
momentarily
in
that
part
of
the
sky
which
filled
their
fissure
;
*NL*
her
disk
was
blood-red
and
half
overcast
;
she
seemed
to
throw
on
me
one
*NL*
bewildered
,
dreary
glance
,
and
buried
herself
again
instantly
in
the
deep
*NL*
drift
of
cloud
.
The
wind
fell
,
for
a
second
,
round
Thornfield
;
but
far
*NL*
away
over
wood
and
water
,
poured
a
wild
,
melancholy
wail
:
it
was
sad
to
*NL*
listen
to
,
and
I
ran
off
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
and
there
I
strayed
through
the
orchard
,
gathered
up
the
apples
with
*NL*
which
the
grass
round
the
tree
roots
was
thickly
strewn
;
then
I
employed
*NL*
myself
in
dividing
the
ripe
from
the
unripe
;
I
carried
them
into
the
*NL*
house
and
put
them
away
in
the
store-room
.
Then
I
repaired
to
the
*NL*
library
to
ascertain
whether
the
fire
was
lit
,
for
,
though
summer
,
I
knew
*NL*
on
such
a
gloomy
evening
Mr.
Rochester
would
like
to
see
a
cheerful
*NL*
hearth
when
he
came
in
:
yes
,
the
fire
had
been
kindled
some
time
,
and
*NL*
burnt
well
.
I
placed
his
arm-chair
by
the
chimney-corner
:
I
wheeled
the
*NL*
table
near
it
:
I
let
down
the
curtain
,
and
had
the
candles
brought
in
*NL*
ready
for
lighting
.
More
restless
than
ever
,
when
I
had
completed
these
*NL*
arrangements
I
could
not
sit
still
,
nor
even
remain
in
the
house
:
a
*NL*
little
time-piece
in
the
room
and
the
old
clock
in
the
hall
*NL*
simultaneously
struck
ten
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
late
it
grows
!
''
I
said
.
``
I
will
run
down
to
the
gates
:
it
is
*NL*
moonlight
at
intervals
;
I
can
see
a
good
way
on
the
road
.
He
may
be
*NL*
coming
now
,
and
to
meet
him
will
save
some
minutes
of
suspense
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
wind
roared
high
in
the
great
trees
which
embowered
the
gates
;
but
*NL*
the
road
as
far
as
I
could
see
,
to
the
right
hand
and
the
left
,
was
all
*NL*
still
and
solitary
:
save
for
the
shadows
of
clouds
crossing
it
at
*NL*
intervals
as
the
moon
looked
out
,
it
was
but
a
long
pale
line
,
unvaried
*NL*
by
one
moving
speck
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
puerile
tear
dimmed
my
eye
while
I
looked
--
a
tear
of
disappointment
and
*NL*
impatience
;
ashamed
of
it
,
I
wiped
it
away
.
I
lingered
;
the
moon
shut
*NL*
herself
wholly
within
her
chamber
,
and
drew
close
her
curtain
of
dense
*NL*
cloud
:
the
night
grew
dark
;
rain
came
driving
fast
on
the
gale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
he
would
come
!
I
wish
he
would
come
!
''
I
exclaimed
,
seized
with
*NL*
hypochondriac
foreboding
.
I
had
expected
his
arrival
before
tea
;
now
it
*NL*
was
dark
:
what
could
keep
him
?
Had
an
accident
happened
?
The
event
of
*NL*
last
night
again
recurred
to
me
.
I
interpreted
it
as
a
warning
of
*NL*
disaster
.
I
feared
my
hopes
were
too
bright
to
be
realised
;
and
I
had
*NL*
enjoyed
so
much
bliss
lately
that
I
imagined
my
fortune
had
passed
its
*NL*
meridian
,
and
must
now
decline
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
can
not
return
to
the
house
,
''
I
thought
;
``
I
can
not
sit
by
the
*NL*
fireside
,
while
he
is
abroad
in
inclement
weather
:
better
tire
my
limbs
*NL*
than
strain
my
heart
;
I
will
go
forward
and
meet
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
set
out
;
I
walked
fast
,
but
not
far
:
ere
I
had
measured
a
quarter
of
a
*NL*
mile
,
I
heard
the
tramp
of
hoofs
;
a
horseman
came
on
,
full
gallop
;
a
dog
*NL*
ran
by
his
side
.
Away
with
evil
presentiment
!
It
was
he
:
here
he
was
,
*NL*
mounted
on
Mesrour
,
followed
by
Pilot
.
He
saw
me
;
for
the
moon
had
*NL*
opened
a
blue
field
in
the
sky
,
and
rode
in
it
watery
bright
:
he
took
his
*NL*
hat
off
,
and
waved
it
round
his
head
.
I
now
ran
to
meet
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
as
he
stretched
out
his
hand
and
bent
from
the
*NL*
saddle
:
``
You
ca
n't
do
without
me
,
that
is
evident
.
Step
on
my
boot-toe
;
*NL*
give
me
both
hands
:
mount
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
obeyed
:
joy
made
me
agile
:
I
sprang
up
before
him
.
A
hearty
kissing
I
*NL*
got
for
a
welcome
,
and
some
boastful
triumph
,
which
I
swallowed
as
well
*NL*
as
I
could
.
He
checked
himself
in
his
exultation
to
demand
,
``
But
is
*NL*
there
anything
the
matter
,
Janet
,
that
you
come
to
meet
me
at
such
an
*NL*
hour
?
Is
there
anything
wrong
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
but
I
thought
you
would
never
come
.
I
could
not
bear
to
wait
in
the
*NL*
house
for
you
,
especially
with
this
rain
and
wind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rain
and
wind
,
indeed
!
Yes
,
you
are
dripping
like
a
mermaid
;
pull
my
*NL*
cloak
round
you
:
but
I
think
you
are
feverish
,
Jane
:
both
your
cheek
and
*NL*
hand
are
burning
hot
.
I
ask
again
,
is
there
anything
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
now
;
I
am
neither
afraid
nor
unhappy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
have
been
both
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rather
:
but
I
'll
tell
you
all
about
it
by-and-bye
,
sir
;
and
I
daresay
*NL*
you
will
only
laugh
at
me
for
my
pains
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
laugh
at
you
heartily
when
to-morrow
is
past
;
till
then
I
dare
not
:
*NL*
my
prize
is
not
certain
.
This
is
you
,
who
have
been
as
slippery
as
an
*NL*
eel
this
last
month
,
and
as
thorny
as
a
briar-rose
?
I
could
not
lay
a
*NL*
finger
anywhere
but
I
was
pricked
;
and
now
I
seem
to
have
gathered
up
a
*NL*
stray
lamb
in
my
arms
.
You
wandered
out
of
the
fold
to
seek
your
*NL*
shepherd
,
did
you
,
Jane
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wanted
you
:
but
do
n't
boast
.
Here
we
are
at
Thornfield
:
now
let
me
*NL*
get
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
landed
me
on
the
pavement
.
As
John
took
his
horse
,
and
he
followed
me
*NL*
into
the
hall
,
he
told
me
to
make
haste
and
put
something
dry
on
,
and
*NL*
then
return
to
him
in
the
library
;
and
he
stopped
me
,
as
I
made
for
the
*NL*
staircase
,
to
extort
a
promise
that
I
would
not
be
long
:
nor
was
I
long
;
*NL*
in
five
minutes
I
rejoined
him
.
I
found
him
at
supper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
a
seat
and
bear
me
company
,
Jane
:
please
God
,
it
is
the
last
meal
*NL*
but
one
you
will
eat
at
Thornfield
Hall
for
a
long
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
sat
down
near
him
,
but
told
him
I
could
not
eat
.
``
Is
it
because
you
*NL*
have
the
prospect
of
a
journey
before
you
,
Jane
?
Is
it
the
thoughts
of
*NL*
going
to
London
that
takes
away
your
appetite
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
see
my
prospects
clearly
to-night
,
sir
;
and
I
hardly
know
what
*NL*
thoughts
I
have
in
my
head
.
Everything
in
life
seems
unreal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Except
me
:
I
am
substantial
enough
--
touch
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
,
sir
,
are
the
most
phantom-like
of
all
:
you
are
a
mere
dream
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
held
out
his
hand
,
laughing
.
``
Is
that
a
dream
?
''
said
he
,
placing
it
*NL*
close
to
my
eyes
.
He
had
a
rounded
,
muscular
,
and
vigorous
hand
,
as
well
*NL*
as
a
long
,
strong
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
though
I
touch
it
,
it
is
a
dream

said
I
,
as
I
put
it
down
from
*NL*
before
my
face
.
``
Sir
,
have
you
finished
supper
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Jane
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
rang
the
bell
and
ordered
away
the
tray
.
When
we
were
again
alone
,
I
*NL*
stirred
the
fire
,
and
then
took
a
low
seat
at
my
master
's
knee
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
near
midnight

I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

remember

Jane

the
night

my

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did

*NL*
*NL*
``

he
returned
,
``

shall
leave
Thornfield
to-morrow

within
half-an-hour

*NL*
*NL*
``
Very

With

you
uttered
that
word

very
well

spot

colour
you
have
on

strangely
your

glitter

Are

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

not

no

may

*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
hypochondria

over-fatigued

*NL*
``
Do

calm

*NL*
*NL*
``
Calm

no

happy

*NL*
*NL*
I
looked
up
at
him
to
read
the
signs
of
bliss
in
his
face
:
it
was
ardent
*NL*
and
flushed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
me
your
confidence

he
said
:
``
relieve
your

any

weight

oppresses
it

imparting
it
to

fear
?

that
*NL*
I
shall
not
prove
a
good

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is

you
are
passing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
puzzle
me
,
Jane
:
your
look
and
tone
of
sorrowful
audacity
perplex
*NL*
and
pain
me
.
I
want
an
explanation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
sir
,
listen
.
You
were
from
home
last
night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
:
I
know
that
;
and
you
hinted
a
while
ago
at
something
which
had
*NL*
happened
in
my
absence
:
--
nothing
,
probably
,
of
consequence
;
but
,
in
*NL*
short
,
it
has
disturbed
you
.
Let
me
hear
it
.
Mrs.
Fairfax
has
said
*NL*
something
,
perhaps
?
or
you
have
overheard
the
servants
talk
?
--
your
*NL*
sensitive
self-respect
has
been
wounded
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
.
''
It
struck
twelve
--
I
waited
till
the
time-piece
had
concluded
*NL*
its
silver
chime
,
and
the
clock
its
hoarse
,
vibrating
stroke
,
and
then
I
*NL*
proceeded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
day
yesterday
I
was
very
busy
,
and
very
happy
in
my
ceaseless
*NL*
bustle
;
for
I
am
not
,
as
you
seem
to
think
,
troubled
by
any
haunting
*NL*
fears
about
the
new
sphere
,
et
cetera
:
I
think
it
a
glorious
thing
to
*NL*
have
the
hope
of
living
with
you
,
because
I
love
you
.
No
,
sir
,
do
n't
*NL*
caress
me
now
--
let
me
talk
undisturbed
.
Yesterday
I
trusted
well
in
*NL*
Providence
,
and
believed
that
events
were
working
together
for
your
good
*NL*
and
mine
:
it
was
a
fine
day
,
if
you
recollect
--
the
calmness
of
the
air
*NL*
and
sky
forbade
apprehensions
respecting
your
safety
or
comfort
on
your
*NL*
journey
.
I
walked
a
little
while
on
the
pavement
after
tea
,
thinking
of
*NL*
you
;
and
I
beheld
you
in
imagination
so
near
me
,
I
scarcely
missed
your
*NL*
actual
presence
.
I
thought
of
the
life
that
lay
before
me
--
_
your
_
life
,
*NL*
sir
--
an
existence
more
expansive
and
stirring
than
my
own
:
as
much
more
*NL*
so
as
the
depths
of
the
sea
to
which
the
brook
runs
are
than
the
shallows
*NL*
of
its
own
strait
channel
.
I
wondered
why
moralists
call
this
world
a
*NL*
dreary
wilderness
:
for
me
it
blossomed
like
a
rose
.
Just
at
sunset
,
the
*NL*
air
turned
cold
and
the
sky
cloudy
:
I
went
in
,
Sophie
called
me
upstairs
*NL*
to
look
at
my
wedding-dress
,
which
they
had
just
brought
;
and
under
it
in
*NL*
the
box
I
found
your
present
--
the
veil
which
,
in
your
princely
*NL*
extravagance
,
you
sent
for
from
London
:
resolved
,
I
suppose
,
since
I
*NL*
would
not
have
jewels
,
to
cheat
me
into
accepting
something
as
costly
.
I
*NL*
smiled
as
I
unfolded
it
,
and
devised
how
I
would
tease
you
about
your
*NL*
aristocratic
tastes
,
and
your
efforts
to
masque
your
plebeian
bride
in
*NL*
the
attributes
of
a
peeress
.
I
thought
how
I
would
carry
down
to
you
the
*NL*
square
of
unembroidered
blond
I
had
myself
prepared
as
a
covering
for
my
*NL*
low-born
head
,
and
ask
if
that
was
not
good
enough
for
a
woman
who
could
*NL*
bring
her
husband
neither
fortune
,
beauty
,
nor
connections
.
I
saw
*NL*
plainly
how
you
would
look
;
and
heard
your
impetuous
republican
answers
,
*NL*
and
your
haughty
disavowal
of
any
necessity
on
your
part
to
augment
your
*NL*
wealth
,
or
elevate
your
standing
,
by
marrying
either
a
purse
or
a
*NL*
coronet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
well
you
read
me
,
you
witch
!
''
interposed
Mr.
Rochester
:
``
but
what
*NL*
did
you
find
in
the
veil
besides
its
embroidery
?
Did
you
find
poison
,
or
*NL*
a
dagger
,
that
you
look
so
mournful
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
sir
;
besides
the
delicacy
and
richness
of
the
fabric
,
I
found
*NL*
nothing
save
Fairfax
Rochester
's
pride
;
and
that
did
not
scare
me
,
*NL*
because
I
am
used
to
the
sight
of
the
demon
.
But
,
sir
,
as
it
grew
dark
,
*NL*
the
wind
rose
:
it
blew
yesterday
evening
,
not
as
it
blows
now
--
wild
and
*NL*
high
--
but
`
with
a
sullen
,
moaning
sound
'
far
more
eerie
.
I
wished
you
*NL*
were
at
home
.
I
came
into
this
room
,
and
the
sight
of
the
empty
chair
*NL*
and
fireless
hearth
chilled
me
.
For
some
time
after
I
went
to
bed
,
I
*NL*
could
not
sleep
--
a
sense
of
anxious
excitement
distressed
me
.
The
gale
*NL*
still
rising
,
seemed
to
my
ear
to
muffle
a
mournful
under-sound
;
whether
*NL*
in
the
house
or
abroad
I
could
not
at
first
tell
,
but
it
recurred
,
*NL*
doubtful
yet
doleful
at
every
lull
;
at
last
I
made
out
it
must
be
some
*NL*
dog
howling
at
a
distance
.
I
was
glad
when
it
ceased
.
On
sleeping
,
I
*NL*
continued
in
dreams
the
idea
of
a
dark
and
gusty
night
.
I
continued
also
*NL*
the
wish
to
be
with
you
,
and
experienced
a
strange
,
regretful
*NL*
consciousness
of
some
barrier
dividing
us
.
During
all
my
first
sleep
,
I
*NL*
was
following
the
windings
of
an
unknown
road
;
total
obscurity
environed
*NL*
me
;
rain
pelted
me
;
I
was
burdened
with
the
charge
of
a
little
child
:
a
*NL*
very
small
creature
,
too
young
and
feeble
to
walk
,
and
which
shivered
in
*NL*
my
cold
arms
,
and
wailed
piteously
in
my
ear
.
I
thought
,
sir
,
that
you
*NL*
were
on
the
road
a
long
way
before
me
;
and
I
strained
every
nerve
to
*NL*
overtake
you
,
and
made
effort
on
effort
to
utter
your
name
and
entreat
*NL*
you
to
stop
--
but
my
movements
were
fettered
,
and
my
voice
still
died
away
*NL*
inarticulate
;
while
you
,
I
felt
,
withdrew
farther
and
farther
every
*NL*
moment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
these
dreams
weigh
on
your
spirits
now
,
Jane

when
I
am
close
to
*NL*
you

Little
nervous
subject
!
Forget
visionary
woe
,
and
think
only
of
*NL*
real
happiness
!
You
say
you
love
me
,
Janet
:
yes
--
I
will
not
forget
that
;
*NL*
and
you
can
not
deny
it

_
Those
_
words
did
not
die
inarticulate
on
your
*NL*
lips

I
heard
them
clear
and
soft
:
a
thought

solemn
perhaps
,

*NL*
sweet
as
music
--

I
think
it
is
a
glorious
thing
to
have
the
hope

living
with
you

love

he
said

after
some
minutes

silence
,
``
it

strange

that

penetrated
my

painfully

I

said
it
with
such
an
earnest

religious
energy

because
your
upward

at

is
the
very
sublime
of
faith

truth

devotion

tease
me
,
vex
me
;
do
anything

move

would
rather
be

incensed

saddened

in

shook

But
I

not

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
disquietude
of
his
air
,
the
somewhat
apprehensive
impatience
of
his
*NL*
manner
,
surprised
me
:
but
I
proceeded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dreamt
another
dream
,
sir
:
that
Thornfield
Hall
was
a
dreary
ruin
,
the
*NL*
retreat
of
bats
and
owls
.
I
thought
that
of
all
the
stately
front
*NL*
nothing
remained
but
a
shell-like
wall
,
very
high
and
very
*NL*
fragile-looking
.
I
wandered
,
on
a
moonlight
night
,
through
the
grass
-
*NL*
grown
enclosure
within
:
here
I
stumbled
over
a
marble
hearth
,
and
there
*NL*
over
a
fallen
fragment
of
cornice
.
Wrapped
up
in
a
shawl
,
I
still
*NL*
carried
the
unknown
little
child
:
I
might
not
lay
it
down
anywhere
,
*NL*
however
tired
were
my
arms
--
however
much
its
weight
impeded
my
progress
,
*NL*
I
must
retain
it
.
I
heard
the
gallop
of
a
horse
at
a
distance
on
the
*NL*
road
;
I
was
sure
it
was
you
;
and
you
were
departing
for
many
years
and
*NL*
for
a
distant
country
.
I
climbed
the
thin
wall
with
frantic
perilous
*NL*
haste
,
eager
to
catch
one
glimpse
of
you
from
the
top
:
the
stones
rolled
*NL*
from
under
my
feet
,
the
ivy
branches
I
grasped
gave
way
,
the
child
clung
*NL*
round
my
neck
in
terror
,
and
almost
strangled
me
;
at
last
I
gained
the
*NL*
summit
.
I
saw
you
like
a
speck
on
a
white
track
,
lessening
every
moment
.
*NL*
The
blast
blew
so
strong
I
could
not
stand
.
I
sat
down
on
the
narrow
*NL*
ledge
;
I
hushed
the
scared
infant
in
my
lap
:
you
turned
an
angle
of
the
*NL*
road
:
I
bent
forward
to
take
a
last
look
;
the
wall
crumbled
;
I
was
*NL*
shaken
;
the
child
rolled
from
my
knee
,
I
lost
my
balance
,
fell
,
and
*NL*
woke
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Jane
,
that
is
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
the
preface
,
sir
;
the
tale
is
yet
to
come
.
On
waking
,
a
gleam
*NL*
dazzled
my
eyes
;
I
thought
--
Oh
,
it
is
daylight
!
But
I
was
mistaken
;
it
*NL*
was
only
candlelight
.
Sophie
,
I
supposed
,
had
come
in
.
There
was
a
*NL*
light
in
the
dressing-table
,
and
the
door
of
the
closet
,
where
,
before
*NL*
going
to
bed
,
I
had
hung
my
wedding-dress
and
veil
,
stood
open
;
I
heard
a
*NL*
rustling
there
.
I
asked
,
`
Sophie
,
what
are
you
doing
?
'
No
one
answered
;
*NL*
but
a
form
emerged
from
the
closet
;
it
took
the
light
,
held
it
aloft
,
and
*NL*
surveyed
the
garments
pendent
from
the
portmanteau
.
`
Sophie
!
Sophie
!
'
I
*NL*
again
cried
:
and
still
it
was
silent
.
I
had
risen
up
in
bed
,
I
bent
*NL*
forward
:
first
surprise
,
then
bewilderment
,
came
over
me
;
and
then
my
*NL*
blood
crept
cold
through
my
veins
.
Mr.
Rochester
,
this
was
not
Sophie

*NL*
it
was
not
Leah

it
was
not
Mrs.
Fairfax

no

was
sure
of
*NL*
it

still

was
not

strange
woman

Grace
Poole

*NL*
*NL*
``
It

been

interrupted
my
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,

,
I
solemnly
assure
you
to
the
contrary

The
shape
standing
*NL*
before
me
had
never
crossed
my
eyes
within
the
precincts
of
Thornfield
*NL*
Hall
before
;
the
height

contour
were
new
to
me

woman

tall

large

with
thick
and
dark
hair
*NL*
hanging
long
down
her
back
.
I
know
not
what
dress
she
had
on
:
it
was

white

straight
;

presently

took
my

held
*NL*
it
up

gazed
at
it
long
,
and
then
she
threw
it
over
her
own
head

and
*NL*
turned
to
the
mirror

At
that

reflection

quite
distinctly

dark
oblong
glass

*NL*
scarcely
pant
.
After
some
minutes
'
silence
,
he
continued
,
cheerily
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Janet
,
I
'll
explain
to
you
all
about
it
.
It
was
half
dream
,
half
*NL*
reality
.
A
woman
did
,
I
doubt
not
,
enter
your
room
:
and
that
woman
*NL*
was
--
must
have
been
--
Grace
Poole
.
You
call
her
a
strange
being
yourself
:
*NL*
from
all
you
know
,
you
have
reason
so
to
call
her
--
what
did
she
do
to
me
?
*NL*
what
to
Mason
?
In
a
state
between
sleeping
and
waking
,
you
noticed
her
*NL*
entrance
and
her
actions
;
but
feverish
,
almost
delirious
as
you
were
,
you
*NL*
ascribed
to
her
a
goblin
appearance
different
from
her
own
:
the
long
*NL*
dishevelled
hair
,
the
swelled
black
face
,
the
exaggerated
stature
,
were
*NL*
figments
of
imagination
;
results
of
nightmare
:
the
spiteful
tearing
of
*NL*
the
veil
was
real
:
and
it
is
like
her
.
I
see
you
would
ask
why
I
keep
*NL*
such
a
woman
in
my
house
:
when
we
have
been
married
a
year
and
a
day
,
I
*NL*
will
tell
you
;
but
not
now
.
Are
you
satisfied
,
Jane
?
Do
you
accept
my
*NL*
solution
of
the
mystery
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
reflected
,
and
in
truth
it
appeared
to
me
the
only
possible
one
:
*NL*
satisfied
I
was
not
,
but
to
please
him
I
endeavoured
to
appear
*NL*
so
--
relieved
,
I
certainly
did
feel
;
so
I
answered
him
with
a
contented
*NL*
smile
.
And
now
,
as
it
was
long
past
one
,
I
prepared
to
leave
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
not
Sophie
sleep
with
Adele
in
the
nursery
?
''
he
asked
,
as
I
lit
my
*NL*
candle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
there
is
room
enough
in
Adele
's
little
bed
for
you
.
You
must
share
*NL*
it
with
her
to-night
,
Jane
:
it
is
no
wonder
that
the
incident
you
have
*NL*
related
should
make
you
nervous
,
and
I
would
rather
you
did
not
sleep
*NL*
alone
:
promise
me
to
go
to
the
nursery
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
be
very
glad
to
do
so
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
fasten
the
door
securely
on
the
inside
.
Wake
Sophie
when
you
go
*NL*
upstairs
,
under
pretence
of
requesting
her
to
rouse
you
in
good
time
to
-
*NL*
morrow
;
for
you
must
be
dressed
and
have
finished
breakfast
before
eight
.
*NL*
And
now
,
no
more
sombre
thoughts
:
chase
dull
care
away
,
Janet
.
Do
n't
you
*NL*
hear
to
what
soft
whispers
the
wind
has
fallen
?
and
there
is
no
more
*NL*
beating
of
rain
against
the
window-panes
:
look
here
''
-LRB-
he
lifted
up
the
*NL*
curtain
-RRB-
--
``
it
is
a
lovely
night
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
.
Half
heaven
was
pure
and
stainless
:
the
clouds
,
now
trooping
*NL*
before
the
wind
,
which
had
shifted
to
the
west
,
were
filing
off
eastward
*NL*
in
long
,
silvered
columns
.
The
moon
shone
peacefully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Mr.
Rochester
,
gazing
inquiringly
into
my
eyes
,
``
how
is
my
*NL*
Janet
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
night
is
serene
,
sir
;
and
so
am
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
will
not
dream
of
separation
and
sorrow
to-night
;
but
of
happy
*NL*
love
and
blissful
union
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
prediction
was
but
half
fulfilled
:
I
did
not
indeed
dream
of
sorrow
,
*NL*
but
as
little
did
I
dream
of
joy
;
for
I
never
slept
at
all
.
With
little
*NL*
Adele
in
my
arms
,
I
watched
the
slumber
of
childhood
--
so
tranquil
,
so
*NL*
passionless
,
so
innocent
--
and
waited
for
the
coming
day
:
all
my
life
was
*NL*
awake
and
astir
in
my
frame
:
and
as
soon
as
the
sun
rose
I
rose
too
.
I
*NL*
remember
Adele
clung
to
me
as
I
left
her
:
I
remember
I
kissed
her
as
I
*NL*
loosened
her
little
hands
from
my
neck
;
and
I
cried
over
her
with
strange
*NL*
emotion
,
and
quitted
her
because
I
feared
my
sobs
would
break
her
still
*NL*
sound
repose
.
She
seemed
the
emblem
of
my
past
life
;
and
here
I
was
now
*NL*
to
array
myself
to
meet
,
the
dread
,
but
adored
,
type
of
my
unknown
future
*NL*
day
.

CHAPTER
XXVI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Sophie
came
at
seven
to
dress
me
:
she
was
very
long
indeed
in
*NL*
accomplishing
her
task
;
so
long
that
Mr.
Rochester
,
grown
,
I
suppose
,
*NL*
impatient
of
my
delay
,
sent
up
to
ask
why
I
did
not
come
.
She
was
just
*NL*
fastening
my
veil
-LRB-
the
plain
square
of
blond
after
all
-RRB-
to
my
hair
with
a
*NL*
brooch
;
I
hurried
from
under
her
hands
as
soon
as
I
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
!
''
she
cried
in
French
.
``
Look
at
yourself
in
the
mirror
:
you
have
*NL*
not
taken
one
peep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
I
turned
at
the
door
:
I
saw
a
robed
and
veiled
figure
,
so
unlike
my
*NL*
usual
self
that
it
seemed
almost
the
image
of
a
stranger
.
``
Jane
!
''
called
*NL*
a
voice
,
and
I
hastened
down
.
I
was
received
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
*NL*
by
Mr.
Rochester
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lingerer
!
''
he
said
,
``
my
brain
is
on
fire
with
impatience
,
and
you
tarry
*NL*
so
long
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
me
into
the
dining-room
,
surveyed
me
keenly
all
over
,
pronounced
*NL*
me
``
fair
as
a
lily
,
and
not
only
the
pride
of
his
life
,
but
the
desire
of
*NL*
his
eyes
,
''
and
then
telling
me
he
would
give
me
but
ten
minutes
to
eat
*NL*
some
breakfast
,
he
rang
the
bell
.
One
of
his
lately
hired
servants
,
a
*NL*
footman
,
answered
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
John
getting
the
carriage
ready
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
the
luggage
brought
down
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
bringing
it
down
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
you
to
the
church
:
see
if
Mr.
Wood
-LRB-
the
clergyman
-RRB-
and
the
clerk
are
*NL*
there
:
return
and
tell
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
church
,
as
the
reader
knows
,
was
but
just
beyond
the
gates
;
the
*NL*
footman
soon
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Wood
is
in
the
vestry
,
sir
,
putting
on
his
surplice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
carriage
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
horses
are
harnessing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
not
want
it
to
go
to
church
;
but
it
must
be
ready
the
moment
we
*NL*
return
:
all
the
boxes
and
luggage
arranged
and
strapped
on
,
and
the
*NL*
coachman
in
his
seat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jane
,
are
you
ready
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
rose
.
There
were
no
groomsmen
,
no
bridesmaids
,
no
relatives
to
wait
*NL*
for
or
marshal
:
none
but
Mr.
Rochester
and
I.
Mrs.
Fairfax
stood
in
the
*NL*
hall
as
we
passed
.
I
would
fain
have
spoken
to
her
,
but
my
hand
was
*NL*
held
by
a
grasp
of
iron
:
I
was
hurried
along
by
a
stride
I
could
hardly
*NL*
follow
;
and
to
look
at
Mr.
Rochester
's
face
was
to
feel
that
not
a
second
*NL*
of
delay
would
be
tolerated
for
any
purpose
.
I
wonder
what
other
*NL*
bridegroom
ever
looked
as
he
did
--
so
bent
up
to
a
purpose
,
so
grimly
*NL*
resolute
:
or
who
,
under
such
steadfast
brows
,
ever
revealed
such
flaming
*NL*
and
flashing
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
know
not
whether
the
day
was
fair
or
foul
;
in
descending
the
drive
,
I
*NL*
gazed
neither
on
sky
nor
earth
:
my
heart
was
with
my
eyes
;
and
both
*NL*
seemed
migrated
into
Mr.
Rochester
's
frame
.
I
wanted
to
see
the
*NL*
invisible
thing
on
which
,
as
we
went
along
,
he
appeared
to
fasten
a
*NL*
glance
fierce
and
fell
.
I
wanted
to
feel
the
thoughts
whose
force
he
*NL*
seemed
breasting
and
resisting
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
churchyard
wicket
he
stopped
:
he
discovered
I
was
quite
out
of
*NL*
breath
.
``
Am
I
cruel
in
my
love
?
''
he
said
.
``
Delay
an
instant
:
lean
on
*NL*
me
,
Jane
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
I
can
recall
the
picture
of
the
grey
old
house
of
God
rising
calm
*NL*
before
me
,
of
a
rook
wheeling
round
the
steeple
,
of
a
ruddy
morning
sky
*NL*
beyond
.
I
remember
something
,
too
,
of
the
green
grave-mounds
;
and
I
have
*NL*
not
forgotten
,
either
,
two
figures
of
strangers
straying
amongst
the
low
*NL*
hillocks
and
reading
the
mementoes
graven
on
the
few
mossy
head-stones
.
I
*NL*
noticed
them
,
because
,
as
they
saw
us
,
they
passed
round
to
the
back
of
*NL*
the
church
;
and
I
doubted
not
they
were
going
to
enter
by
the
side-aisle
*NL*
door
and
witness
the
ceremony
.
By
Mr.
Rochester
they
were
not
observed
;
*NL*
he
was
earnestly
looking
at
my
face
from
which
the
blood
had
,
I
daresay
,
*NL*
momentarily
fled
:
for
I
felt
my
forehead
dewy
,
and
my
cheeks
and
lips
*NL*
cold
.
When
I
rallied
,
which
I
soon
did
,
he
walked
gently
with
me
up
the
*NL*
path
to
the
porch
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
entered
the
quiet
and
humble
temple
;
the
priest
waited
in
his
white
*NL*
surplice
at
the
lowly
altar
,
the
clerk
beside
him
.
All
was
still
:
two
*NL*
shadows
only
moved
in
a
remote
corner
.
My
conjecture
had
been
correct
:
*NL*
the
strangers
had
slipped
in
before
us
,
and
they
now
stood
by
the
vault
*NL*
of
the
Rochesters
,
their
backs
towards
us
,
viewing
through
the
rails
the
*NL*
old
time-stained
marble
tomb
,
where
a
kneeling
angel
guarded
the
remains
*NL*
of
Damer
de
Rochester
,
slain
at
Marston
Moor
in
the
time
of
the
civil
*NL*
wars
,
and
of
Elizabeth
,
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
place
was
taken
at
the
communion
rails
.
Hearing
a
cautious
step
*NL*
behind
me
,
I
glanced
over
my
shoulder
:
one
of
the
strangers
--
a
gentleman
,
*NL*
evidently
--
was
advancing
up
the
chancel
.
The
service
began
.
The
*NL*
explanation
of
the
intent
of
matrimony
was
gone
through
;
and
then
the
*NL*
clergyman
came
a
step
further
forward
,
and
,
bending
slightly
towards
Mr.
*NL*
Rochester
,
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
require
and
charge
you
both
-LRB-
as
ye
will
answer
at
the
dreadful
day
of
*NL*
judgment
,
when
the
secrets
of
all
hearts
shall
be
disclosed
-RRB-
,
that
if
*NL*
either
of
you
know
any
impediment
why
ye
may
not
lawfully
be
joined
*NL*
together
in
matrimony
,
ye
do
now
confess
it
;
for
be
ye
well
assured
that
*NL*
so
many
as
are
coupled
together
otherwise
than
God
's
Word
doth
allow
,
are
*NL*
not
joined
together
by
God
,
neither
is
their
matrimony
lawful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
,
as
the
custom
is
.
When
is
the
pause
after
that
sentence
ever
*NL*
broken
by
reply
?
Not
,
perhaps
,
once
in
a
hundred
years
.
And
the
*NL*
clergyman
,
who
had
not
lifted
his
eyes
from
his
book
,
and
had
held
his
*NL*
breath
but
for
a
moment
,
was
proceeding
:
his
hand
was
already
stretched
*NL*
towards
Mr.
Rochester
,
as
his
lips
unclosed
to
ask
,
``
Wilt
thou
have
this
*NL*
woman
for
thy
wedded
wife
?
''
--
when
a
distinct
and
near
voice
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
marriage
can
not
go
on
:
I
declare
the
existence
of
an
impediment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
clergyman
looked
up
at
the
speaker
and
stood
mute
;
the
clerk
did
the
*NL*
same
;
Mr.
Rochester
moved
slightly
,
as
if
an
earthquake
had
rolled
under
*NL*
his
feet
:
taking
a
firmer
footing
,
and
not
turning
his
head
or
eyes
,
he
*NL*
said
,
``
Proceed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Profound
silence
fell
when
he
had
uttered
that
word
,
with
deep
but
low
*NL*
intonation
.
Presently
Mr.
Wood
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
proceed
without
some
investigation
into
what
has
been
asserted
,
*NL*
and
evidence
of
its
truth
or
falsehood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
ceremony
is
quite
broken
off
,
''
subjoined
the
voice
behind
us
.
``
I
am
*NL*
in
a
condition
to
prove
my
allegation
:
an
insuperable
impediment
to
this
*NL*
marriage
exists
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Rochester
heard
,
but
heeded
not
:
he
stood
stubborn
and
rigid
,
making
*NL*
no
movement
but
to
possess
himself
of
my
hand
.
What
a
hot
and
strong
*NL*
grasp
he
had
!
and
how
like
quarried
marble
was
his
pale
,
firm
,
massive
*NL*
front
at
this
moment
!
How
his
eye
shone
,
still
watchful
,
and
yet
wild
*NL*
beneath
!
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Wood
seemed
at
a
loss
.
``
What
is
the
nature
of
the
impediment
?
''
he
*NL*
asked
.
``
Perhaps
it
may
be
got
over
--
explained
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hardly
,
''
was
the
answer
.
``
I
have
called
it
insuperable
,
and
I
speak
*NL*
advisedly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
speaker
came
forward
and
leaned
on
the
rails
.
He
continued
,
uttering
*NL*
each
word
distinctly
,
calmly
,
steadily
,
but
not
loudly
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
simply
consists
in
the
existence
of
a
previous
marriage
.
Mr.
*NL*
Rochester
has
a
wife
now
living
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
nerves
vibrated
to
those
low-spoken
words
as
they
had
never
vibrated
*NL*
to
thunder
--
my
blood
felt
their
subtle
violence
as
it
had
never
felt
*NL*
frost
or
fire
;
but
I
was
collected
,
and
in
no
danger
of
swooning
.
I
*NL*
looked
at
Mr.
Rochester
:
I
made
him
look
at
me
.
His
whole
face
was
*NL*
colourless
rock
:
his
eye
was
both
spark
and
flint
.
He
disavowed
nothing
:
*NL*
he
seemed
as
if
he
would
defy
all
things
.
Without
speaking
,
without
*NL*
smiling
,
without
seeming
to
recognise
in
me
a
human
being
,
he
only
twined
*NL*
my
waist
with
his
arm
and
riveted
me
to
his
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
are
you
?
''
he
asked
of
the
intruder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
name
is
Briggs
,
a
solicitor
of
--
Street
,
London
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
would
thrust
on
me
a
wife
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
remind
you
of
your
lady
's
existence

,
which
the

recognises

do
not
.

*NL*
*NL*
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly

''
Mr.
Briggs
calmly
took
a
paper
from
his
pocket
,
and
read
*NL*
out
in
a
sort
of
official
,
nasal
voice
:

*NL*
*NL*
''
'
I
affirm
and
can
prove
that
on
the
20th
of
October
A.D.

a

fifteen
years
back

,
Edward

in
the
*NL*
county

*NL*
*NL*

the

``

Mr.

the

goodness

step
forward

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Rochester
,
on
hearing
the
name
,
set
his
teeth
;
he
experienced
,
too
,
a
*NL*
sort
of
strong
convulsive
quiver
;
near
to
him
as
I
was
,
I
felt
the
*NL*
spasmodic
movement
of
fury
or
despair
run
through
his
frame
.
The
second
*NL*
stranger
,
who
had
hitherto
lingered
in
the
background
,
now
drew
near
;
a
*NL*
pale
face
looked
over
the
solicitor
's
shoulder
--
yes
,
it
was
Mason
*NL*
himself
.
Mr.
Rochester
turned
and
glared
at
him
.
His
eye
,
as
I
have
*NL*
often
said
,
was
a
black
eye
:
it
had
now
a
tawny
,
nay
,
a
bloody
light
in
*NL*
its
gloom
;
and
his
face
flushed
--
olive
cheek
and
hueless
forehead
*NL*
received
a
glow
as
from
spreading
,
ascending
heart-fire
:
and
he
stirred
,
*NL*
lifted
his
strong
arm
--
he
could
have
struck
Mason
,
dashed
him
on
the
*NL*
church-floor
,
shocked
by
ruthless
blow
the
breath
from
his
body
--
but
*NL*
Mason
shrank
away
,
and
cried
faintly
,
``
Good
God
!
''
Contempt
fell
cool
on
*NL*
Mr.
Rochester
--
his
passion
died
as
if
a
blight
had
shrivelled
it
up
:
he
*NL*
only
asked
--
``
What
have
_
you
_
to
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
An
inaudible
reply
escaped
Mason
's
white
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
devil
is
in
it
if
you
can
not
answer
distinctly
.
I
again
demand
,
*NL*
what
have
you
to
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
--
sir
,
''
interrupted
the
clergyman
,
``
do
not
forget
you
are
in
a
sacred
*NL*
place
.
''
Then
addressing
Mason
,
he
inquired
gently
,
``
Are
you
aware
,
sir
,
*NL*
whether
or
not
this
gentleman
's
wife
is
still
living
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Courage
,
''
urged
the
lawyer
,
--
``
speak
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
now
living
at
Thornfield
Hall
,
''
said
Mason
,
in
more
articulate
*NL*
tones
:
``
I
saw
her
there
last
April
.
I
am
her
brother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
Thornfield
Hall
!
''
ejaculated
the
clergyman
.
``
Impossible
!
I
am
an
*NL*
old
resident
in
this
neighbourhood
,
sir
,
and
I
never
heard
of
a
Mrs.
*NL*
Rochester
at
Thornfield
Hall
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
saw
a
grim
smile
contort
Mr.
Rochester
's
lips
,
and
he
muttered
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
by
God
!
I
took
care
that
none
should
hear
of
it
--
or
of
her
under
*NL*
that
name
.
''
He
mused
--
for
ten
minutes
he
held
counsel
with
himself
:
he
*NL*
formed
his
resolve
,
and
announced
it
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Enough
!
all
shall
bolt
out
at
once
,
like
the
bullet
from
the
barrel
.
*NL*
Wood
,
close
your
book
and
take
off
your
surplice
;
John
Green
-LRB-
to
the
*NL*
clerk
-RRB-
,
leave
the
church
:
there
will
be
no
wedding
to-day
.
''
The
man
*NL*
obeyed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Rochester
continued
,
hardily
and
recklessly
:
``
Bigamy
is
an
ugly
*NL*
word
!
--
I
meant
,
however
,
to
be
a
bigamist
;
but
fate
has
out-manoeuvred
*NL*
me
,
or
Providence
has
checked
me
,
--
perhaps
the
last
.
I
am
little
better
*NL*
than
a
devil
at
this
moment
;
and
,
as
my
pastor
there
would
tell
me
,
*NL*
deserve
no
doubt
the
sternest
judgments
of
God
,
even
to
the
quenchless
*NL*
fire
and
deathless
worm
.
Gentlemen
,
my
plan
is
broken
up
:
--
what
this
*NL*
lawyer
and
his
client
say
is
true
:
I
have
been
married
,
and
the
woman
to
*NL*
whom
I
was
married
lives
!
You
say
you
never
heard
of
a
Mrs.
Rochester
at
*NL*
the
house
up
yonder
,
Wood
;
but
I
daresay
you
have
many
a
time
inclined
*NL*
your
ear
to
gossip
about
the
mysterious
lunatic
kept
there
under
watch
*NL*
and
ward
.
Some
have
whispered
to
you
that
she
is
my
bastard
half-sister
:
*NL*
some
,
my
cast-off
mistress
.
I
now
inform
you
that
she
is
my
wife
,
whom
I
*NL*
married
fifteen
years
ago
,
--
Bertha
Mason
by
name
;
sister
of
this
resolute
*NL*
personage
,
who
is
now
,
with
his
quivering
limbs
and
white
cheeks
,
showing
*NL*
you
what
a
stout
heart
men
may
bear
.
Cheer
up
,
Dick
!
--
never
fear
me
!
--
I
'd
*NL*
almost
as
soon
strike
a
woman
as
you
.
Bertha
Mason
is
mad
;
and
she
came
*NL*
of
a
mad
family
;
idiots
and
maniacs
through
three
generations
!
Her
*NL*
mother
,
the
Creole
,
was
both
a
madwoman
and
a
drunkard
!
--
as
I
found
out
*NL*
after
I
had
wed
the
daughter
:
for
they
were
silent
on
family
secrets
*NL*
before
.
Bertha
,
like
a
dutiful
child
,
copied
her
parent
in
both
points
.
*NL*
I
had
a
charming
partner
--
pure
,
wise
,
modest
:
you
can
fancy
I
was
a
happy
*NL*
man
.
I
went
through
rich
scenes
!
Oh
!
my
experience
has
been
heavenly
,
*NL*
if
you
only
knew
it
!
But
I
owe
you
no
further
explanation
.
Briggs
,
*NL*
Wood
,
Mason
,
I
invite
you
all
to
come
up
to
the
house
and
visit
Mrs.
*NL*
Poole
's
patient
,
and
_
my
wife
_
!
You
shall
see
what
sort
of
a
being
I
was
*NL*
cheated
into
espousing
,
and
judge
whether
or
not
I
had
a
right
to
break
*NL*
the
compact
,
and
seek
sympathy
with
something
at
least
human
.
This
*NL*
girl
,
''
he
continued
,
looking
at
me
,
``
knew
no
more
than
you
,
Wood
,
of
the
*NL*
disgusting
secret
:
she
thought
all
was
fair
and
legal
and
never
dreamt
*NL*
she
was
going
to
be
entrapped
into
a
feigned
union
with
a
defrauded
*NL*
wretch
,
already
bound
to
a
bad
,
mad
,
and
embruted
partner
!
Come
all
of
*NL*
you
--
follow
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Still
holding
me
fast
,
he
left
the
church
:
the
three
gentlemen
came
*NL*
after
.
At
the
front
door
of
the
hall
we
found
the
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
it
back
to
the
coach-house
,
John
,
''
said
Mr.
Rochester
coolly
;
``
it
*NL*
will
not
be
wanted
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
our
entrance
,
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
Adele
,
Sophie
,
Leah
,
advanced
to
meet
and
*NL*
greet
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
right-about
--
every
soul
!
''
cried
the
master
;
``
away
with
your
*NL*
congratulations
!
Who
wants
them
?
Not
I
!
--
they
are
fifteen
years
too
*NL*
late
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
passed
on
and
ascended
the
stairs
,
still
holding
my
hand
,
and
still
*NL*
beckoning
the
gentlemen
to
follow
him
,
which
they
did
.
We
mounted
the
*NL*
first
staircase
,
passed
up
the
gallery
,
proceeded
to
the
third
storey
:
*NL*
the
low
,
black
door
,
opened
by
Mr.
Rochester
's
master-key
,
admitted
us
to
*NL*
the
tapestried
room
,
with
its
great
bed
and
its
pictorial
cabinet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
this
place
,
Mason
,
''
said
our
guide
;
``
she
bit
and
stabbed
you
*NL*
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
lifted
the
hangings
from
the
wall
,
uncovering
the
second
door
:
this
,
*NL*
too
,
he
opened
.
In
a
room
without
a
window
,
there
burnt
a
fire
guarded
*NL*
by
a
high
and
strong
fender
,
and
a
lamp
suspended
from
the
ceiling
by
a
*NL*
chain
.
Grace
Poole
bent
over
the
fire
,
apparently
cooking
something
in
a
*NL*
saucepan
.
In
the
deep
shade
,
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
,
a
figure
*NL*
ran
backwards
and
forwards
.
What
it
was
,
whether
beast
or
human
being
,
*NL*
one
could
not
,
at
first
sight
,
tell
:
it
grovelled
,
seemingly
,
on
all
*NL*
fours
;
it
snatched
and
growled
like
some
strange
wild
animal
:
but
it
was
*NL*
covered
with
clothing
,
and
a
quantity
of
dark
,
grizzled
hair
,
wild
as
a
*NL*
mane
,
hid
its
head
and
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-morrow
,
Mrs.
Poole
!
''
said
Mr.
Rochester
.
``
How
are
you
?
and
how
is
*NL*
your
charge
to-day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
're
tolerable
,
sir
,
I
thank
you
,
''
replied
Grace
,
lifting
the
boiling
*NL*
mess
carefully
on
to
the
hob
:
``
rather
snappish
,
but
not
`
rageous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
fierce
cry
seemed
to
give
the
lie
to
her
favourable
report
:
the
clothed
*NL*
hyena
rose
up
,
and
stood
tall
on
its
hind-feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
sir
,
she
sees
you
!
''
exclaimed
Grace
:
``
you
'd
better
not
stay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
a
few
moments
,
Grace
:
you
must
allow
me
a
few
moments
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
care
then
,
sir
!
--
for
God
's
sake
,
take
care
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
maniac
bellowed
:
she
parted
her
shaggy
locks
from
her
visage
,
and
*NL*
gazed
wildly
at
her
visitors
.
I
recognised
well
that
purple
face
,
--
those
*NL*
bloated
features
.
Mrs.
Poole
advanced
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Keep
out
of
the
way
,
''
said
Mr.
Rochester
,
thrusting
her
aside
:
``
she
has
*NL*
no
knife
now
,
I
suppose
,
and
I
'm
on
my
guard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
never
knows
what
she
has
,
sir
:
she
is
so
cunning
:
it
is
not
in
*NL*
mortal
discretion
to
fathom
her
craft
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
had
better
leave
her
,
''
whispered
Mason
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
to
the
devil
!
''
was
his
brother-in-law
's
recommendation
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Ware
!
''
cried
Grace
.
The
three
gentlemen
retreated
simultaneously
.
Mr.
*NL*
Rochester
flung
me
behind
him
:
the
lunatic
sprang
and
grappled
his
throat
*NL*
viciously
,
and
laid
her
teeth
to
his
cheek
:
they
struggled
.
She
was
a
*NL*
big
woman
,
in
stature
almost
equalling
her
husband
,
and
corpulent
*NL*
besides
:
she
showed
virile
force
in
the
contest
--
more
than
once
she
*NL*
almost
throttled
him
,
athletic
as
he
was
.
He
could
have
settled
her
with
*NL*
a
well-planted
blow
;
but
he
would
not
strike
:
he
would
only
wrestle
.
At
*NL*
last
he
mastered
her
arms
;
Grace
Poole
gave
him
a
cord
,
and
he
pinioned
*NL*
them
behind
her
:
with
more
rope
,
which
was
at
hand
,
he
bound
her
to
a
*NL*
chair
.
The
operation
was
performed
amidst
the
fiercest
yells
and
the
*NL*
most
convulsive
plunges
.
Mr.
Rochester
then
turned
to
the
spectators
:
he
*NL*
looked
at
them
with
a
smile
both
acrid
and
desolate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
_
my
wife
_
,
''
said
he
.
``
Such
is
the
sole
conjugal
embrace
I
am
*NL*
ever
to
know
--
such
are
the
endearments
which
are
to
solace
my
leisure
*NL*
hours
!
And
_
this
_
is
what
I
wished
to
have
''
-LRB-
laying
his
hand
on
my
*NL*
shoulder
-RRB-
:
``
this
young
girl
,
who
stands
so
grave
and
quiet
at
the
mouth
*NL*
of
hell
,
looking
collectedly
at
the
gambols
of
a
demon
,
I
wanted
her
just
*NL*
as
a
change
after
that
fierce
ragout

Wood
and
Briggs

look
at
the
*NL*
difference

Compare
these
clear
eyes
with
the
red
balls
yonder

this
*NL*
face

that
mask

this
form
with

!
Off
with
you
now
.
I
must
shut
up
my
prize
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
all
withdrew
.
Mr.
Rochester
stayed
a
moment
behind
us
,
to
give
some
*NL*
further
order
to
Grace
Poole
.
The
solicitor
addressed
me
as
he
descended
*NL*
the
stair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
,
madam
,
''
said
he
,
``
are
cleared
from
all
blame
:
your
uncle
will
be
*NL*
glad
to
hear
it
--
if
,
indeed
,
he
should
be
still
living
--
when
Mr.
Mason
*NL*
returns
to
Madeira
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
uncle
!
What
of
him
?
Do
you
know
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Mason
does
.
Mr.
Eyre
has
been
the
Funchal
correspondent
of
his
*NL*
house
for
some
years
.
When
your
uncle
received
your
letter
intimating
*NL*
the
contemplated
union
between
yourself
and
Mr.
Rochester
,
Mr.
Mason
,
who
*NL*
was
staying
at
Madeira
to
recruit
his
health
,
on
his
way
back
to
Jamaica
,
*NL*
happened
to
be
with
him
.
Mr.
Eyre
mentioned
the
intelligence
;
for
he
*NL*
knew
that
my
client
here
was
acquainted
with
a
gentleman
of
the
name
of
*NL*
Rochester
.
Mr.
Mason
,
astonished
and
distressed
as
you
may
suppose
,
*NL*
revealed
the
real
state
of
matters
.
Your
uncle
,
I
am
sorry
to
say
,
is
*NL*
now
on
a
sick
bed
;
from
which
,
considering
the
nature
of
his
*NL*
disease
--
decline
--
and
the
stage
it
has
reached
,
it
is
unlikely
he
will
*NL*
ever
rise
.
He
could
not
then
hasten
to
England
himself
,
to
extricate
you
*NL*
from
the
snare
into
which
you
had
fallen
,
but
he
implored
Mr.
Mason
to
*NL*
lose
no
time
in
taking
steps
to
prevent
the
false
marriage
.
He
referred
*NL*
him
to
me
for
assistance
.
I
used
all
despatch
,
and
am
thankful
I
was
not
*NL*
too
late
:
as
you
,
doubtless
,
must
be
also
.
Were
I
not
morally
certain
*NL*
that
your
uncle
will
be
dead
ere
you
reach
Madeira
,
I
would
advise
you
to
*NL*
accompany
Mr.
Mason
back
;
but
as
it
is
,
I
think
you
had
better
remain
in
*NL*
England
till
you
can
hear
further
,
either
from
or
of
Mr.
Eyre
.
Have
we
*NL*
anything
else
to
stay
for
?
''
he
inquired
of
Mr.
Mason
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
--
let
us
be
gone
,
''
was
the
anxious
reply
;
and
without
waiting
to
*NL*
take
leave
of
Mr.
Rochester
,
they
made
their
exit
at
the
hall
door
.
The
*NL*
clergyman
stayed
to
exchange
a
few
sentences
,
either
of
admonition
or
*NL*
reproof
,
with
his
haughty
parishioner
;
this
duty
done
,
he
too
departed
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
heard
him
go
as
I
stood
at
the
half-open
door
of
my
own
room
,
to
which
*NL*
I
had
now
withdrawn
.
The
house
cleared
,
I
shut
myself
in
,
fastened
the
*NL*
bolt
that
none
might
intrude
,
and
proceeded
--
not
to
weep
,
not
to
mourn
,
I
*NL*
was
yet
too
calm
for
that
,
but
--
mechanically
to
take
off
the
wedding
*NL*
dress
,
and
replace
it
by
the
stuff
gown
I
had
worn
yesterday
,
as
I
*NL*
thought
,
for
the
last
time
.
I
then
sat
down
:
I
felt
weak
and
tired
.
I
*NL*
leaned
my
arms
on
a
table
,
and
my
head
dropped
on
them
.
And
now
I
*NL*
thought
:
till
now
I
had
only
heard
,
seen
,
moved
--
followed
up
and
down
*NL*
where
I
was
led
or
dragged
--
watched
event
rush
on
event
,
disclosure
open
*NL*
beyond
disclosure
:
but
_
now
_
,
_
I
thought
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
morning
had
been
a
quiet
morning
enough
--
all
except
the
brief
scene
*NL*
with
the
lunatic
:
the
transaction
in
the
church
had
not
been
noisy
;
there
*NL*
was
no
explosion
of
passion
,
no
loud
altercation
,
no
dispute
,
no
defiance
*NL*
or
challenge
,
no
tears
,
no
sobs
:
a
few
words
had
been
spoken
,
a
calmly
*NL*
pronounced
objection
to
the
marriage
made
;
some
stern
,
short
questions
*NL*
put
by
Mr.
Rochester
;
answers
,
explanations
given
,
evidence
adduced
;
an
*NL*
open
admission
of
the
truth
had
been
uttered
by
my
master
;
then
the
*NL*
living
proof
had
been
seen
;
the
intruders
were
gone
,
and
all
was
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
in
my
own
room
as
usual
--
just
myself
,
without
obvious
change
:
*NL*
nothing
had
smitten
me
,
or
scathed
me
,
or
maimed
me
.
And
yet
where
was
*NL*
the
Jane
Eyre
of
yesterday
?
--
where
was
her
life
?
--
where
were
her
*NL*
prospects
?
*NL*
*NL*
Jane
Eyre
,
who
had
been
an
ardent
,
expectant
woman
--
almost
a
bride
,
was
a
*NL*
cold
,
solitary
girl
again
:
her
life
was
pale
;
her
prospects
were
*NL*
desolate
.
A
Christmas
frost
had
come
at
midsummer
;
a
white
December
*NL*
storm
had
whirled
over
June
;
ice
glazed
the
ripe
apples
,
drifts
crushed
*NL*
the
blowing
roses
;
on
hayfield
and
cornfield
lay
a
frozen
shroud
:
lanes
*NL*
which
last
night
blushed
full
of
flowers
,
to-day
were
pathless
with
*NL*
untrodden
snow
;
and
the
woods
,
which
twelve
hours
since
waved
leafy
and
*NL*
flagrant
as
groves
between
the
tropics
,
now
spread
,
waste
,
wild
,
and
*NL*
white
as
pine-forests
in
wintry
Norway
.
My
hopes
were
all
dead
--
struck
*NL*
with
a
subtle
doom
,
such
as
,
in
one
night
,
fell
on
all
the
first-born
in
*NL*
the
land
of
Egypt
.
I
looked
on
my
cherished
wishes
,
yesterday
so
*NL*
blooming
and
glowing
;
they
lay
stark
,
chill
,
livid
corpses
that
could
*NL*
never
revive
.
I
looked
at
my
love
:
that
feeling
which
was
my
*NL*
master
's
--
which
he
had
created
;
it
shivered
in
my
heart
,
like
a
suffering
*NL*
child
in
a
cold
cradle
;
sickness
and
anguish
had
seized
it
;
it
could
not
*NL*
seek
Mr.
Rochester
's
arms
--
it
could
not
derive
warmth
from
his
breast
.
*NL*
Oh
,
never
more
could
it
turn
to
him
;
for
faith
was
blighted
--
confidence
*NL*
destroyed
!
Mr.
Rochester
was
not
to
me
what
he
had
been
;
for
he
was
not
*NL*
what
I
had
thought
him
.
I
would
not
ascribe
vice
to
him
;
I
would
not
say
*NL*
he
had
betrayed
me
;
but
the
attribute
of
stainless
truth
was
gone
from
*NL*
his
idea
,
and
from
his
presence
I
must
go
:
_
that
_
I
perceived
well
.
*NL*
When
--
how
--
whither
,
I
could
not
yet
discern
;
but
he
himself
,
I
doubted
*NL*
not
,
would
hurry
me
from
Thornfield
.
Real
affection
,
it
seemed
,
he
could
*NL*
not
have
for
me
;
it
had
been
only
fitful
passion
:
that
was
balked
;
he
*NL*
would
want
me
no
more
.
I
should
fear
even
to
cross
his
path
now
:
my
view
*NL*
must
be
hateful
to
him
.
Oh
,
how
blind
had
been
my
eyes
!
How
weak
my
*NL*
conduct
!
*NL*
*NL*
My
eyes
were
covered
and
closed
:
eddying
darkness
seemed
to
swim
round
*NL*
me
,
and
reflection
came
in
as
black
and
confused
a
flow
.
Self-abandoned
,
*NL*
relaxed
,
and
effortless
,
I
seemed
to
have
laid
me
down
in
the
dried-up
*NL*
bed
of
a
great
river
;
I
heard
a
flood
loosened
in
remote
mountains
,
and
*NL*
felt
the
torrent
come
:
to
rise
I
had
no
will
,
to
flee
I
had
no
strength
.
*NL*
I
lay
faint
,
longing
to
be
dead
.
One
idea
only
still
throbbed
life-like
*NL*
within
me
--
a
remembrance
of
God
:
it
begot
an
unuttered
prayer
:
these
*NL*
words
went
wandering
up
and
down
in
my
rayless
mind
,
as
something
that
*NL*
should
be
whispered
,
but
no
energy
was
found
to
express
them
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
not
far
from
me
,
for
trouble
is
near
:
there
is
none
to
help
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
near
:
and
as
I
had
lifted
no
petition
to
Heaven
to
avert
it
--
as
I
*NL*
had
neither
joined
my
hands
,
nor
bent
my
knees
,
nor
moved
my
lips
--
it
*NL*
came
:
in
full
heavy
swing
the
torrent
poured
over
me
.
The
whole
*NL*
consciousness
of
my
life
lorn
,
my
love
lost
,
my
hope
quenched
,
my
faith
*NL*
death-struck
,
swayed
full
and
mighty
above
me
in
one
sullen
mass
.
That
*NL*
bitter
hour
can
not
be
described
:
in
truth
,
``
the
waters
came
into
my
soul
;
*NL*
I
sank
in
deep
mire
:
I
felt
no
standing
;
I
came
into
deep
waters
;
the
*NL*
floods
overflowed
me
.

CHAPTER
XXVII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Some
time
in
the
afternoon
I
raised
my
head
,
and
looking
round
and
seeing
*NL*
the
western
sun
gilding
the
sign
of
its
decline
on
the
wall
,
I
asked
,
*NL*
``
What
am
I
to
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
answer
my
mind
gave
--
``
Leave
Thornfield
at
once
''
--
was
so
prompt
,
*NL*
so
dread
,
that
I
stopped
my
ears
.
I
said
I
could
not
bear
such
words
*NL*
now
.
``
That
I
am
not
Edward
Rochester
's
bride
is
the
least
part
of
my
*NL*
woe
,
''
I
alleged
:
``
that
I
have
wakened
out
of
most
glorious
dreams
,
and
*NL*
found
them
all
void
and
vain
,
is
a
horror
I
could
bear
and
master
;
but
*NL*
that
I
must
leave
him
decidedly
,
instantly
,
entirely
,
is
intolerable
.
I
*NL*
can
not
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
then
,
a
voice
within
me
averred
that
I
could
do
it
and
foretold
that
*NL*
I
should
do
it
.
I
wrestled
with
my
own
resolution
:
I
wanted
to
be
weak
*NL*
that
I
might
avoid
the
awful
passage
of
further
suffering
I
saw
laid
out
*NL*
for
me
;
and
Conscience
,
turned
tyrant
,
held
Passion
by
the
throat
,
told
*NL*
her
tauntingly
,
she
had
yet
but
dipped
her
dainty
foot
in
the
slough
,
and
*NL*
swore
that
with
that
arm
of
iron
he
would
thrust
her
down
to
unsounded
*NL*
depths
of
agony
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
be
torn
away
,
''
then
I
cried
.
``
Let
another
help
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
you
shall
tear
yourself
away
,
none
shall
help
you
:
you
shall
*NL*
yourself
pluck
out
your
right
eye
;
yourself
cut
off
your
right
hand
:
your
*NL*
heart
shall
be
the
victim
,
and
you
the
priest
to
transfix
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
rose
up
suddenly
,
terror-struck
at
the
solitude
which
so
ruthless
a
*NL*
judge
haunted
,
--
at
the
silence
which
so
awful
a
voice
filled
.
My
head
*NL*
swam
as
I
stood
erect
.
I
perceived
that
I
was
sickening
from
excitement
*NL*
and
inanition
;
neither
meat
nor
drink
had
passed
my
lips
that
day
,
for
I
*NL*
had
taken
no
breakfast
.
And
,
with
a
strange
pang
,
I
now
reflected
that
,
*NL*
long
as
I
had
been
shut
up
here
,
no
message
had
been
sent
to
ask
how
I
*NL*
was
,
or
to
invite
me
to
come
down
:
not
even
little
Adele
had
tapped
at
*NL*
the
door
;
not
even
Mrs.
Fairfax
had
sought
me
.
``
Friends
always
forget
*NL*
those
whom
fortune
forsakes
,
''
I
murmured
,
as
I
undrew
the
bolt
and
passed
*NL*
out
.
I
stumbled
over
an
obstacle
:
my
head
was
still
dizzy
,
my
sight
was
*NL*
dim
,
and
my
limbs
were
feeble
.
I
could
not
soon
recover
myself
.
I
fell
,
*NL*
but
not
on
to
the
ground
:
an
outstretched
arm
caught
me
.
I
looked
up
--
I
*NL*
was
supported
by
Mr.
Rochester
,
who
sat
in
a
chair
across
my
chamber
*NL*
threshold
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
come
out
at
last
,
''
he
said
.
``
Well
,
I
have
been
waiting
for
you
*NL*
long
,
and
listening
:
yet
not
one
movement
have
I
heard
,
nor
one
sob
:
five
*NL*
minutes
more
of
that
death-like
hush
,
and
I
should
have
forced
the
lock
*NL*
like
a
burglar
.
So
you
shun
me
?
--
you
shut
yourself
up
and
grieve
alone
!
*NL*
I
would
rather
you
had
come
and
upbraided
me
with
vehemence
.
You
are
*NL*
passionate
.
I
expected
a
scene
of
some
kind
.
I
was
prepared
for
the
hot
*NL*
rain
of
tears
;
only
I
wanted
them
to
be
shed
on
my
breast
:
now
a
*NL*
senseless
floor
has
received
them
,
or
your
drenched
handkerchief
.
But
I
*NL*
err
:
you
have
not
wept
at
all
!
I
see
a
white
cheek
and
a
faded
eye
,
but
*NL*
no
trace
of
tears
.
I
suppose
,
then
,
your
heart
has
been
weeping
blood
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Jane
!
not
a
word
of
reproach
?
Nothing
bitter
--
nothing
poignant
?
*NL*
Nothing
to
cut
a
feeling
or
sting
a
passion
?
You
sit
quietly
where
I
*NL*
have
placed
you
,
and
regard
me
with
a
weary
,
passive
look
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jane
,
I
never
meant
to
wound
you
thus
.
If
the
man
who
had
but
one
*NL*
little
ewe
lamb
that
was
dear
to
him
as
a
daughter
,
that
ate
of
his
bread
*NL*
and
drank
of
his
cup
,
and
lay
in
his
bosom
,
had
by
some
mistake
*NL*
slaughtered
it
at
the
shambles
,
he
would
not
have
rued
his
bloody
blunder
*NL*
more
than
I
now
rue
mine
.
Will
you
ever
forgive
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Reader
,
I
forgave
him
at
the
moment
and
on
the
spot
.
There
was
such
deep
*NL*
remorse
in
his
eye
,
such
true
pity
in
his
tone
,
such
manly
energy
in
his
*NL*
manner
;
and
besides
,
there
was
such
unchanged
love
in
his
whole
look
and
*NL*
mien
--
I
forgave
him
all
:
yet
not
in
words
,
not
outwardly
;
only
at
my
*NL*
heart
's
core
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
I
am
a
scoundrel
,
Jane
?
''
ere
long
he
inquired
*NL*
wistfully
--
wondering
,
I
suppose
,
at
my
continued
silence
and
tameness
,
*NL*
the
result
rather
of
weakness
than
of
will
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
tell
me
so
roundly
and
sharply
--
do
n't
spare
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
:
I
am
tired
and
sick
.
I
want
some
water
.
''
He
heaved
a
sort
of
*NL*
shuddering
sigh
,
and
taking
me
in
his
arms
,
carried
me
downstairs
.
At
*NL*
first
I
did
not
know
to
what
room
he
had
borne
me
;
all
was
cloudy
to
my
*NL*
glazed
sight
:
presently
I
felt
the
reviving
warmth
of
a
fire
;
for
,
summer
*NL*
as
it
was
,
I
had
become
icy
cold
in
my
chamber
.
He
put
wine
to
my
lips
;
*NL*
I
tasted
it
and
revived
;
then
I
ate
something
he
offered
me
,
and
was
soon
*NL*
myself
.
I
was
in
the
library
--
sitting
in
his
chair
--
he
was
quite
near
.
*NL*
``
If
I
could
go
out
of
life
now
,
without
too
sharp
a
pang
,
it
would
be
*NL*
well
for
me
,
''
I
thought
;
``
then
I
should
not
have
to
make
the
effort
of
*NL*
cracking
my
heart-strings
in
rending
them
from
among
Mr.
Rochester
's
.
I
*NL*
must
leave
him
,
it
appears
.
I
do
not
want
to
leave
him
--
I
can
not
leave
*NL*
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
are
you
now
,
Jane
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Much
better
,
sir
;
I
shall
be
well
soon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Taste
the
wine
again
,
Jane
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
obeyed
him
;
then
he
put
the
glass
on
the
table
,
stood
before
me
,
and
*NL*
looked
at
me
attentively
.
Suddenly
he
turned
away
,
with
an
inarticulate
*NL*
exclamation
,
full
of
passionate
emotion
of
some
kind
;
he
walked
fast
*NL*
through
the
room
and
came
back
;
he
stooped
towards
me
as
if
to
kiss
me
;
*NL*
but
I
remembered
caresses
were
now
forbidden
.
I
turned
my
face
away
and
*NL*
put
his
aside
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
--
How
is
this
?
''
he
exclaimed
hastily
.
``
Oh
,
I
know
!
you
wo
n't
kiss
*NL*
the
husband
of
Bertha
Mason
?
You
consider
my
arms
filled
and
my
embraces
*NL*
appropriated
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
any
rate
,
there
is
neither
room
nor
claim
for
me
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Jane
?
I
will
spare
you
the
trouble
of
much
talking
;
I
will
answer
*NL*
for
you

Because
I
have
a
wife
already
,
you
would
reply
.
--
I
guess
*NL*
rightly
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
think
so
,
you
must
have
a
strange
opinion
of
me
;
you
must
regard
*NL*
me
as
a
plotting
profligate
--
a
base
and
low
rake
who
has
been
simulating
*NL*
disinterested
love
in
order
to
draw
you
into
a
snare
deliberately
laid
,
*NL*
and
strip
you
of
honour
and
rob
you
of
self-respect
.
What
do
you
say
to
*NL*
that
?
I
see
you
can
say
nothing
in
the
first
place
,
you
are
faint
still
,
*NL*
and
have
enough
to
do
to
draw
your
breath
;
in
the
second
place
,
you
*NL*
can
not
yet
accustom
yourself
to
accuse
and
revile
me
,
and
besides
,
the
*NL*
flood-gates
of
tears
are
opened
,
and
they
would
rush
out
if
you
spoke
*NL*
much
;
and
you
have
no
desire
to
expostulate
,
to
upbraid
,
to
make
a
scene

you
are
thinking
how

act

talking

you
consider
is
of
no
use

I
*NL*
know
you

I
am
on
my
guard

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
I
do
not
wish
to
act
against
you
,
''
I
said
;
and
my
unsteady
voice
*NL*
warned
me
to
curtail
my
sentence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
in
your
sense
of
the

in
mine
you
are
scheming

me

have
as
good
as
said
that
I
am
a
married
man

as
a
married
man
*NL*
you
will
shun
me
,
keep
out
of
my
way
:
just
now
you
have
refused
to
kiss
*NL*
me

You
intend
to
make
yourself
a
complete
stranger
to
me

to
live
under
*NL*
this
roof
only
as
Adele

governess

I
say
a
friendly
word
to
*NL*
you

if
ever
a
friendly
feeling
inclines
you
again
to
me

nearly
made
me
his
mistress

*NL*
*NL*
I
cleared
and
steadied
my
voice
to
reply
:
``
All
is
changed
about

change
too

is
no

continual
combats
with
recollections

*NL*
there
is
only
one

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

Adele
will
go
to
school

I
have
settled
that
already

do
I
mean
*NL*
to
torment
you
with
the
hideous
associations
and
recollections
of
*NL*
Thornfield
Hall
--
this
accursed
place
--
this
tent
of
Achan
--
this
insolent
*NL*
vault
,
offering
the
ghastliness
of
living
death
to
the
light
of
the
open
*NL*
sky
--
this
narrow
stone
hell
,
with
its
one
real
fiend

worse
than
a
legion
*NL*
of
such
as
we
imagine
.
Jane
,
you
shall
not
stay
here
,
nor
will
I.
I
was
*NL*
wrong
ever
to
bring
you
to
Thornfield
Hall
,
knowing
as
I
did
how
it
was
*NL*
haunted
.
I
charged
them
to
conceal
from
you
,
before
I
ever
saw
you
,
all
*NL*
knowledge
of
the
curse
of
the
place
;
merely
because
I
feared
Adele
never
*NL*
would
have
a
governess
to
stay
if
she
knew
with
what
inmate
she
was
*NL*
housed
,
and
my
plans
would
not
permit
me
to
remove
the
maniac
*NL*
elsewhere
--
though
I
possess
an
old
house
,
Ferndean
Manor
,
even
more
*NL*
retired
and
hidden
than
this
,
where
I
could
have
lodged
her
safely
*NL*
enough
,
had
not
a
scruple
about
the
unhealthiness
of
the
situation
,
in
*NL*
the
heart
of
a
wood
,
made
my
conscience
recoil
from
the
arrangement
.
*NL*
Probably
those
damp
walls
would
soon
have
eased
me
of
her
charge
:
but
to
*NL*
each
villain
his
own
vice
;
and
mine
is
not
a
tendency
to
indirect
*NL*
assassination
,
even
of
what
I
most
hate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Concealing
the
mad-woman
's
neighbourhood
from
you
,
however
,
was
*NL*
something
like
covering
a
child
with
a
cloak
and
laying
it
down
near
a
*NL*
upas-tree
:
that
demon
's
vicinage
is
poisoned
,
and
always
was
.
But
I
'll
*NL*
shut
up
Thornfield
Hall

I
'll
nail
up
the
front
door
and
board
the
lower
*NL*
windows

I
'll
give
Mrs.

two
hundred

here
with
_

as
you
term
that
fearful

Grace
will
do
much
for
money

*NL*
she
shall
have
her
son

the
keeper
at
Grimsby
Retreat

to
bear
her
*NL*
company

be
at
hand
to
give
her
aid
in
the
paroxysms
,
when
_
my
wife
_
*NL*
is
prompted
by
her
familiar
to
burn
people
in
their
beds
at
night

*NL*
stab
them

bite
their
flesh
from
their
bones

so
on

*NL*
``

I
interrupted
him
,

me
again

not

mad

mad

do
you
think
I
should
hate
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
indeed
,
sir

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
are
mistaken

and
you
know
nothing
about
me
,
and
nothing
about
*NL*
the
sort
of
love
of
which
I
am
capable
.
Every
atom
of
your
flesh
is
as
*NL*
dear
to
me
as
my
own
:
in
pain
and
sickness
it
would
still
be
dear
.
Your
*NL*
mind
is
my
treasure
,
and
if
it
were
broken
,
it
would
be
my
treasure
*NL*
still
:
if
you
raved
,
my
arms
should
confine
you
,
and
not
a
strait
*NL*
waistcoat
--
your
grasp
,
even
in
fury
,
would
have
a
charm
for
me
:
if
you
*NL*
flew
at
me
as
wildly
as
that
woman
did
this
morning
,
I
should
receive
you
*NL*
in
an
embrace
,
at
least
as
fond
as
it
would
be
restrictive
.
I
should
not
*NL*
shrink
from
you
with
disgust
as
I
did
from
her
:
in
your
quiet
moments
you
*NL*
should
have
no
watcher
and
no
nurse
but
me
;
and
I
could
hang
over
you
*NL*
with
untiring
tenderness
,
though
you
gave
me
no
smile
in
return
;
and
*NL*
never
weary
of
gazing
into
your
eyes
,
though
they
had
no
longer
a
ray
of
*NL*
recognition
for
me
.
--
But
why
do
I
follow
that
train
of
ideas
?
I
was
*NL*
talking
of
removing
you
from
Thornfield
.
All
,
you
know
,
is
prepared
for
*NL*
prompt
departure
:
to-morrow
you
shall
go
.
I
only
ask
you
to
endure
one
*NL*
more
night
under
this
roof
,
Jane
;
and
then
,
farewell
to
its
miseries
and
*NL*
terrors
for
ever
!
I
have
a
place
to
repair
to
,
which
will
be
a
secure
*NL*
sanctuary
from
hateful
reminiscences
,
from
unwelcome
intrusion
--
even
from
*NL*
falsehood
and
slander
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
take
Adele
with
you
,
sir
,

I
interrupted
;
``
she
will
be
a
companion
*NL*
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean

Jane

I
told
you
I
would
send
Adele
to
school

and
*NL*
what
do
I
want
with
a
child
for
a
companion
,
and
not
my
own
child
,
--
a
*NL*
French
dancer
's
bastard
?
Why
do
you
importune
me
about
her
!
I
say
,
why
*NL*
do
you
assign
Adele
to
me
for
a
companion
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
spoke
of
a
retirement
,
sir

and
retirement
and
solitude
are
dull
:
*NL*
too
dull
for

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Solitude
!
solitude
!
''
he
reiterated
with
irritation
.
``
I
see
I
must
come
*NL*
to
an
explanation

I
do
n't
know
what
sphynx-like
expression
is
forming
*NL*
in
your
countenance
.
You
are
to
share
my
solitude
.
Do
you
understand
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
shook
my
head
:
it
required
a
degree
of
courage
,
excited
as
he
was
*NL*
becoming
,
even
to
risk
that
mute
sign
of
dissent
.
He
had
been
walking
*NL*
fast
about
the
room
,
and
he
stopped
,
as
if
suddenly
rooted
to
one
spot
.
*NL*
He
looked
at
me
long
and
hard
:
I
turned
my
eyes
from
him
,
fixed
them
on
*NL*
the
fire
,
and
tried
to
assume
and
maintain
a
quiet
,
collected
aspect
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
for
the
hitch
in
Jane
's
character
,
''
he
said
at
last
,
speaking
more
*NL*
calmly
than
from
his
look
I
had
expected
him
to
speak
.
``
The
reel
of
silk
*NL*
has
run
smoothly
enough
so
far
;
but
I
always
knew
there
would
come
a
knot
*NL*
and
a
puzzle
:
here
it
is
.
Now
for
vexation
,
and
exasperation
,
and
*NL*
endless
trouble
!
By
God
!
I
long
to
exert
a
fraction
of
Samson
's
*NL*
strength
,
and
break
the
entanglement
like
tow
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
recommenced
his
walk
,
but
soon
again
stopped
,
and
this
time
just
*NL*
before
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jane
!
will
you
hear
reason
?
''
-LRB-
he
stooped
and
approached
his
lips
to
my
*NL*
ear
-RRB-
;
``
because
,
if
you
wo
n't
,
I
'll
try
violence
.
''
His
voice
was
hoarse
;
*NL*
his
look
that
of
a
man
who
is
just
about
to
burst
an
insufferable
bond
*NL*
and
plunge
headlong
into
wild
license
.
I
saw
that
in
another
moment
,
and
*NL*
with
one
impetus
of
frenzy
more
,
I
should
be
able
to
do
nothing
with
him
.
*NL*
The
present
--
the
passing
second
of
time
--
was
all
I
had
in
which
to
*NL*
control
and
restrain
him
--
a
movement
of
repulsion
,
flight
,
fear
would
*NL*
have
sealed
my
doom
,
--
and
his
.
But
I
was
not
afraid
:
not
in
the
least
.
I
*NL*
felt
an
inward
power
;
a
sense
of
influence
,
which
supported
me
.
The
*NL*
crisis
was
perilous
;
but
not
without
its
charm
:
such
as
the
Indian
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
feels
when
he
slips
over
the
rapid
in
his
canoe
.
I
took
hold
of
*NL*
his
clenched
hand
,
loosened
the
contorted
fingers
,
and
said
to
him
,
*NL*
soothingly
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sit
down
;
I
'll
talk
to
you
as
long
as
you
like
,
and
hear
all
you
have
to
*NL*
say
,
whether
reasonable
or
unreasonable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
down
:
but
he
did
not
get
leave
to
speak
directly
.
I
had
been
*NL*
struggling
with
tears
for
some
time
:
I
had
taken
great
pains
to
repress
*NL*
them
,
because
I
knew
he
would
not
like
to
see
me
weep
.
Now
,
however
,
I
*NL*
considered
it
well
to
let
them
flow
as
freely
and
as
long
as
they
liked
.
*NL*
If
the
flood
annoyed
him
,
so
much
the
better
.
So
I
gave
way
and
cried
*NL*
heartily
.
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
I
heard
him
earnestly
entreating
me
to
be
composed
.
I
said
I
could
*NL*
not
while
he
was
in
such
a
passion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
am
not
angry
,
Jane
:
I
only
love
you
too
well
;
and
you
had
steeled
*NL*
your
little
pale
face
with
such
a
resolute
,
frozen
look
,
I
could
not
*NL*
endure

Hush

now

wipe
your

*NL*
*NL*
His
softened
voice
announced
that
he
was
subdued
;
so
I
,
in
my
turn
,
*NL*
became
calm
.
Now
he
made
an
effort
to
rest
his
head
on
my
shoulder
,
but
*NL*
I
would
not
permit
it
.
Then
he
would
draw
me
to
him
:
no
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jane
!
Jane
!
''
he
said
,
in
such
an
accent
of
bitter
sadness
it
thrilled
*NL*
along
every
nerve
I
had
;
``
you
do
n't
love
me
,
then
?
It
was
only
my
*NL*
station
,
and
the
rank
of
my
wife
,
that
you
valued
?
Now
that
you
think
me
*NL*
disqualified
to
become
your
husband
,
you
recoil
from
my
touch
as
if
I
*NL*
were
some
toad
or
ape

''
*NL*
*NL*
These
words
cut
me
:
yet
what
could
I
do
or
I
say
?
I
ought
probably
to
*NL*
have
done
or
said
nothing
;
but
I
was
so
tortured
by
a
sense
of
remorse
at
*NL*
thus
hurting
his
feelings
,
I
could
not
control
the
wish
to
drop
balm
*NL*
where
I
had
wounded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I

do

love

I
said
,
``
more
than
ever

I

not
show

indulge
the

express
it

Of

His
voice
and
hand
quivered
:
his
large
nostrils
dilated
;
his

blazed

still
I
dared
to
speak

He
bared
his

,
and
offered
it
to
me
:
the
blood
was
forsaking
his
*NL*
cheek

lips

they
were
growing
livid

I
was
distressed
on
all

To
agitate
him
thus
deeply
,
by
a
resistance
he
so
abhorred

was
cruel
:
to
*NL*
yield
was
out
of
the
question

I
did
what
human
beings
do
instinctively
*NL*
when
they
are
driven
to
utter
extremity

looked
for
aid

one

*NL*

of

a

older

*NL*

told

I
have
understood
something
to
that
effect

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Jane
,
being
so
,
it
was
his
resolution
to
keep
the
property
*NL*
together
;
he
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
dividing
his
estate
and
leaving
*NL*
me
a
fair
portion
:
all
,
he
resolved
,
should
go
to
my
brother
,
Rowland
.
*NL*
Yet
as
little
could
he
endure
that
a
son
of
his
should
be
a
poor
man
.
I
*NL*
must
be
provided
for
by
a
wealthy
marriage
.
He
sought
me
a
partner
*NL*
betimes
.
Mr.
Mason
,
a
West
India
planter
and
merchant
,
was
his
old
*NL*
acquaintance
.
He
was
certain
his
possessions
were
real
and
vast
:
he
made
*NL*
inquiries
.
Mr.
Mason
,
he
found
,
had
a
son
and
daughter
;
and
he
learned
*NL*
from
him
that
he
could
and
would
give
the
latter
a
fortune
of
thirty
*NL*
thousand
pounds
:
that
sufficed
.
When
I
left
college
,
I
was
sent
out
to
*NL*
Jamaica
,
to
espouse
a
bride
already
courted
for
me
.
My
father
said
*NL*
nothing
about
her
money
;
but
he
told
me
Miss
Mason
was
the
boast
of
*NL*
Spanish
Town
for
her
beauty
:
and
this
was
no
lie
.
I
found
her
a
fine
*NL*
woman
,
in
the
style
of
Blanche
Ingram
:
tall
,
dark
,
and
majestic
.
Her
*NL*
family
wished
to
secure
me
because
I
was
of
a
good
race
;
and
so
did
she
.
*NL*
They
showed
her
to
me
in
parties
,
splendidly
dressed
.
I
seldom
saw
her
*NL*
alone
,
and
had
very
little
private
conversation
with
her
.
She
flattered
*NL*
me
,
and
lavishly
displayed
for
my
pleasure
her
charms
and
*NL*
accomplishments
.
All
the
men
in
her
circle
seemed
to
admire
her
and
envy
*NL*
me
.
I
was
dazzled
,
stimulated
:
my
senses
were
excited
;
and
being
*NL*
ignorant
,
raw
,
and
inexperienced
,
I
thought
I
loved
her
.
There
is
no
*NL*
folly
so
besotted
that
the
idiotic
rivalries
of
society
,
the
prurience
,
*NL*
the
rashness
,
the
blindness
of
youth
,
will
not
hurry
a
man
to
its
*NL*
commission
.
Her
relatives
encouraged
me
;
competitors
piqued
me
;
she
*NL*
allured
me
:
a
marriage
was
achieved
almost
before
I
knew
where
I
was
.
Oh
,
*NL*
I
have
no
respect
for
myself
when
I
think
of
that
act
!
--
an
agony
of
*NL*
inward
contempt
masters
me
.
I
never
loved
,
I
never
esteemed
,
I
did
not
*NL*
even
know
her
.
I
was
not
sure
of
the
existence
of
one
virtue
in
her
*NL*
nature
:
I
had
marked
neither
modesty
,
nor
benevolence
,
nor
candour
,
nor
*NL*
refinement
in
her
mind
or
manners
--
and
,
I
married
her
:
--
gross
,
*NL*
grovelling
,
mole-eyed
blockhead
that
I
was
!
With
less
sin
I
might
*NL*
have
--
But
let
me
remember
to
whom
I
am
speaking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
bride
's
mother
I
had
never
seen
:
I
understood
she
was
dead
.
The
*NL*
honeymoon
over
,
I
learned
my
mistake
;
she
was
only
mad
,
and
shut
up
in
a
*NL*
lunatic
asylum
.
There
was
a
younger
brother
,
too
--
a
complete
dumb
idiot
.
*NL*
The
elder
one

whom
you
have
seen
-LRB-
and
whom
I
can
not
hate
,
whilst
I
abhor
*NL*
all
his
kindred
,
because
he
has
some
grains
of
affection
in
his
feeble
*NL*
mind
,
shown
in
the
continued
interest
he
takes
in
his
wretched
sister
,
*NL*
and
also
in
a
dog-like
attachment
he
once
bore
me
-RRB-
,
will
probably
be
in
*NL*
the
same
state
one
day
.
My
father
and
my
brother
Rowland
knew
all
this
;
*NL*
but
they
thought
only
of
the
thirty
thousand
pounds
,
and
joined
in
the
*NL*
plot
against
me
.
''

*NL*
``
These
were
vile
discoveries

but
except
for
the
treachery
of
*NL*
concealment

I
should
have
made
them
no
subject
of
reproach
to
my
wife

when
I
found
her
nature
wholly
alien

mine

low

narrow

the
day
*NL*

in
comfort

that
kindly
conversation
could
not

sustained

because
whatever

I
started

immediately
received
from

her
a
turn
at
once
coarse

trite

perverse

imbecile

when
I
*NL*
perceived

should
never

no

would
bear

continued
outbreaks

her
violent
and

unreasonable
temper

or
the
vexations
of
her
absurd
,
contradictory
,
*NL*
exacting
orders
--
even
then
I
restrained
myself
:
I
eschewed
upbraiding
,
I
*NL*
curtailed
remonstrance
;
I
tried
to
devour
my
repentance
and
disgust
in
*NL*
secret
;
I
repressed
the
deep
antipathy
I
felt

``
Jane

I
will
not
trouble
you
with
abominable
details

some
strong
words

shall
express
what
I
have
to
say
.
I
lived
with
that
woman
upstairs
four
*NL*
years
,
and
before
that
time
she
had
tried
me
indeed
:
her
character
*NL*
ripened
and
developed
with
frightful
rapidity
;
her
vices
sprang
up
fast
*NL*
and
rank
:
they
were
so
strong
,
only
cruelty
could
check
them
,
and
I
would
*NL*
not
use
cruelty

What
a
pigmy
intellect
she
had
,
and
what
giant
*NL*
propensities
!
How
fearful
were
the
curses
those
propensities
entailed
on
*NL*
me
!
Bertha
Mason
,
the
true
daughter
of
an
infamous
mother
,
dragged
me
*NL*
through
all
the
hideous
and
degrading
agonies
which
must
attend
a
man
*NL*
bound
to
a
wife
at
once
intemperate
and
unchaste

My
brother
in
the
interval
was
dead

and
at
the
end
of
the
four
years
my
*NL*
father
died
too

I
was
rich
enough
now

poor

hideous
indigence

a
*NL*
nature
the
most
gross

impure

depraved
I
ever
saw

was
associated
with
*NL*
mine

called
by
the
law

by
society
a
part

me

And
I
could
not
*NL*
rid
myself
of
it
by
any
legal
proceedings
:
for
the
doctors
now
discovered
*NL*
that
_
my

was
mad

her
excesses
had
prematurely
developed
the
germs

insanity

sick

No

*NL*
``
Pity
,
Jane

from
some
people
is
a
noxious
and
insulting
sort
of
tribute

*NL*
which
one
is
justified
in
hurling
back
in
the
teeth
of
those
who
offer
*NL*
it

that
is
the
sort
of
pity
native
to
callous

selfish
hearts

it
is
*NL*
a
hybrid

egotistical
pain
at
hearing
of
woes

crossed
with
ignorant

contempt

those

endured
them

But
that

not
your
pity

Jane

approached
the
verge

despair

a
remnant

self-respect
was

all

intervened
between

the
gulf

In
the

was

covered

grimy
dishonour

I
resolved

to

I
repudiated
the
contamination

wrenched
myself
from
connection

her
mental

Still

society
associated

something

breath

mixed
with

besides
,
I
remembered
I
had
once
been
her
husband
--
that
*NL*
recollection
was
then
,
and
is
now
,
inexpressibly
odious
to
me
;
moreover
,
*NL*
I
knew
that
while
she
lived
I
could
never
be
the
husband
of
another
and
*NL*
better
wife
;
and
,
though
five
years
my
senior
-LRB-
her
family
and
her
father
*NL*
had
lied
to
me
even
in
the
particular
of
her
age
-RRB-
,
she
was
likely
to
live
*NL*
as
long
as
I
,
being
as
robust
in
frame
as
she
was
infirm
in
mind
.
Thus
,
*NL*
at
the
age
of
twenty-six
,
I
was
hopeless
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
night
I
had
been
awakened
by
her
yells
--
-LRB-
since
the
medical
men
had
*NL*
pronounced
her
mad
,
she
had
,
of
course
,
been
shut
up
-RRB-
--
it
was
a
fiery
*NL*
West
Indian
night
;
one
of
the
description
that
frequently
precede
the
*NL*
hurricanes
of
those
climates
.
Being
unable
to
sleep
in
bed
,
I
got
up
and
*NL*
opened
the
window
.
The
air
was
like
sulphur-steams
--
I
could
find
no
*NL*
refreshment
anywhere
.
Mosquitoes
came
buzzing
in
and
hummed
sullenly
*NL*
round
the
room
;
the
sea
,
which
I
could
hear
from
thence
,
rumbled
dull
*NL*
like
an
earthquake
--
black
clouds
were
casting
up
over
it
;
the
moon
was
*NL*
setting
in
the
waves
,
broad
and
red
,
like
a
hot
cannon-ball
--
she
threw
*NL*
her
last
bloody
glance
over
a
world
quivering
with
the
ferment
of
*NL*
tempest
.
I
was
physically
influenced
by
the
atmosphere
and
scene
,
and
my
*NL*
ears
were
filled
with
the
curses
the
maniac
still
shrieked
out
;
wherein
*NL*
she
momentarily
mingled
my
name
with
such
a
tone
of
demon-hate
,
with
such
*NL*
language
!
--
no
professed
harlot
ever
had
a
fouler
vocabulary
than
she
:
*NL*
though
two
rooms
off
,
I
heard
every
word
--
the
thin
partitions
of
the
West
*NL*
India
house
opposing
but
slight
obstruction
to
her
wolfish
cries
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
This
life
,
'
said
I
at
last
,
`
is
hell
:
this
is
the
air
--
those
are
the
*NL*
sounds
of
the
bottomless
pit
!
I
have
a
right
to
deliver
myself
from
it
*NL*
if
I
can
.
The
sufferings
of
this
mortal
state
will
leave
me
with
the
*NL*
heavy
flesh
that
now
cumbers
my
soul
.
Of
the
fanatic
's
burning
eternity
*NL*
I
have
no
fear
:
there
is
not
a
future
state
worse
than
this
present
*NL*
one
--
let
me
break
away
,
and
go
home
to
God
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
said
this
whilst
I
knelt
down
at
,
and
unlocked
a
trunk
which
contained
*NL*
a
brace
of
loaded
pistols
:
I
mean
to
shoot
myself
.
I
only
entertained
*NL*
the
intention
for
a
moment
;
for
,
not
being
insane
,
the
crisis
of
*NL*
exquisite
and
unalloyed
despair
,
which
had
originated
the
wish
and
design
*NL*
of
self-destruction
,
was
past
in
a
second
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
wind
fresh
from
Europe
blew
over
the
ocean
and
rushed
through
the
open
*NL*
casement
:
the
storm
broke
,
streamed
,
thundered
,
blazed
,
and
the
air
grew
*NL*
pure
.
I
then
framed
and
fixed
a
resolution
.
While
I
walked
under
the
*NL*
dripping
orange-trees
of
my
wet
garden
,
and
amongst
its
drenched
*NL*
pomegranates
and
pine-apples
,
and
while
the
refulgent
dawn
of
the
tropics
*NL*
kindled
round
me
--
I
reasoned
thus
,
Jane
--
and
now
listen
;
for
it
was
true
*NL*
Wisdom
that
consoled
me
in
that
hour
,
and
showed
me
the
right
path
to
*NL*
follow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
sweet
wind
from
Europe
was
still
whispering
in
the
refreshed
leaves
,
*NL*
and
the
Atlantic
was
thundering
in
glorious
liberty
;
my
heart
,
dried
up
*NL*
and
scorched
for
a
long
time
,
swelled
to
the
tone
,
and
filled
with
living
*NL*
blood
--
my
being
longed
for
renewal
--
my
soul
thirsted
for
a
pure
draught
.
*NL*
I
saw
hope
revive
--
and
felt
regeneration
possible
.
From
a
flowery
arch
*NL*
at
the
bottom
of
my
garden
I
gazed
over
the
sea
--
bluer
than
the
sky
:
the
*NL*
old
world
was
beyond
;
clear
prospects
opened
thus
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Go
,
'
said
Hope
,
`
and
live
again
in
Europe
:
there
it
is
not
known
what
a
*NL*
sullied
name
you
bear
,
nor
what
a
filthy
burden
is
bound
to
you
.
You
may
*NL*
take
the
maniac
with
you
to
England
;
confine
her
with
due
attendance
and
*NL*
precautions
at
Thornfield
:
then
travel
yourself
to
what
clime
you
will
,
*NL*
and
form
what
new
tie
you
like
.
That
woman
,
who
has
so
abused
your
long
-
*NL*
suffering
,
so
sullied
your
name
,
so
outraged
your
honour
,
so
blighted
*NL*
your
youth
,
is
not
your
wife
,
nor
are
you
her
husband
.
See
that
she
is
*NL*
cared
for
as
her
condition
demands
,
and
you
have
done
all
that
God
and
*NL*
humanity
require
of
you
.
Let
her
identity
,
her
connection
with
yourself
,
*NL*
be
buried
in
oblivion
:
you
are
bound
to
impart
them
to
no
living
being
.
*NL*
Place
her
in
safety
and
comfort
:
shelter
her
degradation
with
secrecy
,
*NL*
and
leave
her
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
acted
precisely
on
this
suggestion
.
My
father
and
brother
had
not
*NL*
made
my
marriage
known
to
their
acquaintance
;
because
,
in
the
very
first
*NL*
letter
I
wrote
to
apprise
them
of
the
union
--
having
already
begun
to
*NL*
experience
extreme
disgust
of
its
consequences
,
and
,
from
the
family
*NL*
character
and
constitution
,
seeing
a
hideous
future
opening
to
me
--
I
*NL*
added
an
urgent
charge
to
keep
it
secret
:
and
very
soon
the
infamous
*NL*
conduct
of
the
wife
my
father
had
selected
for
me
was
such
as
to
make
him
*NL*
blush
to
own
her
as
his
daughter-in-law
.
Far
from
desiring
to
publish
*NL*
the
connection
,
he
became
as
anxious
to
conceal
it
as
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
England
,
then
,
I
conveyed
her
;
a
fearful
voyage
I
had
with
such
a
*NL*
monster
in
the
vessel
.
Glad
was
I
when
I
at
last
got
her
to
Thornfield
,
*NL*
and
saw
her
safely
lodged
in
that
third-storey
room
,
of
whose
secret
*NL*
inner
cabinet
she
has
now
for
ten
years
made
a
wild
beast
's
den
--
a
*NL*
goblin
's
cell
.
I
had
some
trouble
in
finding
an
attendant
for
her
,
as
it
*NL*
was
necessary
to
select
one
on
whose
fidelity
dependence
could
be
placed
;
*NL*
for
her
ravings
would
inevitably
betray
my
secret
:
besides
,
she
had
lucid
*NL*
intervals
of
days
--
sometimes
weeks
--
which
she
filled
up
with
abuse
of
me
.
*NL*
At
last
I
hired
Grace
Poole
from
the
Grimbsy
Retreat
.
She
and
the
*NL*
surgeon
,
Carter
-LRB-
who
dressed
Mason
's
wounds
that
night
he
was
stabbed
and
*NL*
worried
-RRB-
,
are
the
only
two
I
have
ever
admitted
to
my
confidence
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Fairfax
may
indeed
have
suspected
something
,
but
she
could
have
gained
no
*NL*
precise
knowledge
as
to
facts
.
Grace
has
,
on
the
whole
,
proved
a
good
*NL*
keeper
;
though
,
owing
partly
to
a
fault
of
her
own
,
of
which
it
appears
*NL*
nothing
can
cure
her
,
and
which
is
incident
to
her
harassing
profession
,
*NL*
her
vigilance
has
been
more
than
once
lulled
and
baffled
.
The
lunatic
is
*NL*
both
cunning
and
malignant
;
she
has
never
failed
to
take
advantage
of
her
*NL*
guardian
's
temporary
lapses
;
once
to
secrete
the
knife
with
which
she
*NL*
stabbed
her
brother
,
and
twice
to
possess
herself
of
the
key
of
her
cell
,
*NL*
and
issue
therefrom
in
the
night-time
.
On
the
first
of
these
occasions
,
*NL*
she
perpetrated
the
attempt
to
burn
me
in
my
bed
;
on
the
second
,
she
paid
*NL*
that
ghastly
visit
to
you
.
I
thank
Providence
,
who
watched
over
you
,
*NL*
that
she
then
spent
her
fury
on
your
wedding
apparel
,
which
perhaps
*NL*
brought
back
vague
reminiscences
of
her
own
bridal
days
:
but
on
what
*NL*
might
have
happened
,
I
can
not
endure
to
reflect
.
When
I
think
of
the
*NL*
thing
which
flew
at
my
throat
this
morning
,
hanging
its
black
and
scarlet
*NL*
visage
over
the
nest
of
my
dove
,
my
blood
curdles
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
,
sir
,
''
I
asked
,
while
he
paused
,
``
did
you
do
when
you
had
*NL*
settled
her
here
?
Where
did
you
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
I
do
,
Jane
?
I
transformed
myself
into
a
will-o
'
-
the-wisp
.
*NL*
Where
did
I
go
?
I
pursued
wanderings
as
wild
as
those
of
the
*NL*
March-spirit
.
I
sought
the
Continent
,
and
went
devious
through
all
its
*NL*
lands
.
My
fixed
desire
was
to
seek
and
find
a
good
and
intelligent
*NL*
woman
,
whom
I
could
love
:
a
contrast
to
the
fury
I
left
at
Thornfield
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
could
not
marry
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
determined
and
was
convinced
that
I
could
and
ought
.
It
was
not
*NL*
my
original
intention
to
deceive
,
as
I
have
deceived
you
.
I
meant
to
*NL*
tell
my
tale
plainly
,
and
make
my
proposals
openly
:
and
it
appeared
to
me
*NL*
so
absolutely
rational
that
I
should
be
considered
free
to
love
and
be
*NL*
loved
,
I
never
doubted
some
woman
might
be
found
willing
and
able
to
*NL*
understand
my
case
and
accept
me
,
in
spite
of
the
curse
with
which
I
was
*NL*
burdened
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
you
are
inquisitive
,
Jane
,
you
always
make
me
smile
.
You
open
your
*NL*
eyes
like
an
eager
bird
,
and
make
every
now
and
then
a
restless
movement
,
*NL*
as
if
answers
in
speech
did
not
flow
fast
enough
for
you

you
wanted

But
before
I
go
on

tell
me
what
you

It
is
a
small
phrase
very
frequent
with
you
;
*NL*
and
which
many
a
time
has
drawn
me
on
and
on
through
interminable
talk
:
I
*NL*
do
n't
very
well
know
why

''
*NL*
*NL*

mean

What
next

How
did
you
proceed

What
came
of
such
an
event

Precisely

and
what
do
you
wish
to
know
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whether
you
found
any
one
you
liked

whether
you
asked
her
to
marry

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
tell
you
whether
I
found
any
one
I
liked
,
and
whether
I
asked
her
*NL*
to
marry
me
:
but
what
she
said
is
yet
to
be
recorded
in
the
book
of
Fate
.
*NL*
For
ten
long
years
I
roved
about
,
living
first
in
one
capital
,
then
*NL*
another
:
sometimes
in
St.
Petersburg
;
oftener
in
Paris
;
occasionally
in
*NL*
Rome
,
Naples
,
and
Florence
.
Provided
with
plenty
of
money
and
the
*NL*
passport
of
an
old
name
,
I
could
choose
my
own
society
:
no
circles
were
*NL*
closed
against
me
.
I
sought
my
ideal
of
a
woman
amongst
English
ladies
,
*NL*
French
countesses
,
Italian
signoras
,
and
German
grafinnen
.
I
could
not
*NL*
find
her
.
Sometimes
,
for
a
fleeting
moment
,
I
thought
I
caught
a
glance
,
*NL*
heard
a
tone
,
beheld
a
form
,
which
announced
the
realisation
of
my
dream
:
*NL*
but
I
was
presently
undeserved
.
You
are
not
to
suppose
that
I
desired
*NL*
perfection
,
either
of
mind
or
person
.
I
longed
only
for
what
suited
*NL*
me
--
for
the
antipodes
of
the
Creole
:
and
I
longed
vainly
.
Amongst
them
*NL*
all
I
found
not
one
whom
,
had
I
been
ever
so
free
,
I
--
warned
as
I
was
of
*NL*
the
risks
,
the
horrors
,
the
loathings
of
incongruous
unions
--
would
have
*NL*
asked
to
marry
me
.
Disappointment
made
me
reckless
.
I
tried
*NL*
dissipation
--
never
debauchery
:
that
I
hated
,
and
hate
.
That
was
my
*NL*
Indian
Messalina
's
attribute
:
rooted
disgust
at
it
and
her
restrained
me
*NL*
much
,
even
in
pleasure
.
Any
enjoyment
that
bordered
on
riot
seemed
to
*NL*
approach
me
to
her
and
her
vices
,
and
I
eschewed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
I
could
not
live
alone
;
so
I
tried
the
companionship
of
mistresses
.
*NL*
The
first
I
chose
was
Celine
Varens
--
another
of
those
steps
which
make
a
*NL*
man
spurn
himself
when
he
recalls
them
.
You
already
know
what
she
was
,
*NL*
and
how
my
liaison
with
her
terminated
.
She
had
two
successors
:
an
*NL*
Italian
,
Giacinta
,
and
a
German
,
Clara
;
both
considered
singularly
*NL*
handsome
.
What
was
their
beauty
to
me
in
a
few
weeks
?
Giacinta
was
*NL*
unprincipled
and
violent
:
I
tired
of
her
in
three
months
.
Clara
was
*NL*
honest
and
quiet
;
but
heavy
,
mindless
,
and
unimpressible
:
not
one
whit
to
*NL*
my
taste
.
I
was
glad
to
give
her
a
sufficient
sum
to
set
her
up
in
a
*NL*
good
line
of
business
,
and
so
get
decently
rid
of
her
.
But
,
Jane
,
I
see
*NL*
by
your
face
you
are
not
forming
a
very
favourable
opinion
of
me
just
*NL*
now
.
You
think
me
an
unfeeling
,
loose-principled
rake
:
do
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
like
you
so
well
as
I
have
done
sometimes
,
indeed
,
sir
.
Did
it
*NL*
not
seem
to
you
in
the
least
wrong
to
live
in
that
way
,
first
with
one
*NL*
mistress
and
then
another
?
You
talk
of
it
as
a
mere
matter
of
course
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
with
me
;
and
I
did
not
like
it
.
It
was
a
grovelling
fashion
of
*NL*
existence
:
I
should
never
like
to
return
to
it
.
Hiring
a
mistress
is
the
*NL*
next
worse
thing
to
buying
a
slave
:
both
are
often
by
nature
,
and
always
*NL*
by
position
,
inferior
:
and
to
live
familiarly
with
inferiors
is
*NL*
degrading
.
I
now
hate
the
recollection
of
the
time
I
passed
with
Celine
,
*NL*
Giacinta
,
and
Clara
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
the
truth
of
these
words
;
and
I
drew
from
them
the
certain
*NL*
inference
,
that
if
I
were
so
far
to
forget
myself
and
all
the
teaching
*NL*
that
had
ever
been
instilled
into
me
,
as
--
under
any
pretext
--
with
any
*NL*
justification
--
through
any
temptation
--
to
become
the
successor
of
these
*NL*
poor
girls
,
he
would
one
day
regard
me
with
the
same
feeling
which
now
in
*NL*
his
mind
desecrated
their
memory
.
I
did
not
give
utterance
to
this
*NL*
conviction
:
it
was
enough
to
feel
it
.
I
impressed
it
on
my
heart
,
that
*NL*
it
might
remain
there
to
serve
me
as
aid
in
the
time
of
trial
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Jane
,
why
do
n't
you
say
`
Well
,
sir
?
'
I
have
not
done
.
You
are
*NL*
looking
grave
.
You
disapprove
of
me
still
,
I
see
.
But
let
me
come
to
*NL*
the
point
.
Last
January
,
rid
of
all
mistresses
--
in
a
harsh
,
bitter
frame
*NL*
of
mind
,
the
result
of
a
useless
,
roving
,
lonely
life
--
corroded
with
*NL*
disappointment
,
sourly
disposed
against
all
men
,
and
especially
against
*NL*
all
womankind
-LRB-
for
I
began
to
regard
the
notion
of
an
intellectual
,
*NL*
faithful
,
loving
woman
as
a
mere
dream
-RRB-
,
recalled
by
business
,
I
came
*NL*
back
to
England
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
a
frosty
winter
afternoon
,
I
rode
in
sight
of
Thornfield
Hall
.
*NL*
Abhorred
spot
!
I
expected
no
peace
--
no
pleasure
there
.
On
a
stile
in
*NL*
Hay
Lane
I
saw
a
quiet
little
figure
sitting
by
itself
.
I
passed
it
as
*NL*
negligently
as
I
did
the
pollard
willow
opposite
to
it
:
I
had
no
*NL*
presentiment
of
what
it
would
be
to
me
;
no
inward
warning
that
the
*NL*
arbitress
of
my
life
--
my
genius
for
good
or
evil
--
waited
there
in
humble
*NL*
guise
.
I
did
not
know
it
,
even
when
,
on
the
occasion
of
Mesrour
's
*NL*
accident
,
it
came
up
and
gravely
offered
me
help
.
Childish
and
slender
*NL*
creature
!
It
seemed
as
if
a
linnet
had
hopped
to
my
foot
and
proposed
to
*NL*
bear
me
on
its
tiny
wing
.
I
was
surly
;
but
the
thing
would
not
go
:
it
*NL*
stood
by
me
with
strange
perseverance
,
and
looked
and
spoke
with
a
sort
*NL*
of
authority
.
I
must
be
aided
,
and
by
that
hand
:
and
aided
I
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
once
I
had
pressed
the
frail
shoulder
,
something
new
--
a
fresh
sap
*NL*
and
sense
--
stole
into
my
frame
.
It
was
well
I
had
learnt
that
this
elf
*NL*
must
return
to
me
--
that
it
belonged
to
my
house
down
below
--
or
I
could
*NL*
not
have
felt
it
pass
away
from
under
my
hand
,
and
seen
it
vanish
behind
*NL*
the
dim
hedge
,
without
singular
regret
.
I
heard
you
come
home
that
*NL*
night
,
Jane
,
though
probably
you
were
not
aware
that
I
thought
of
you
or
*NL*
watched
for
you
.
The
next
day
I
observed
you
--
myself
unseen
--
for
half-an
-
*NL*
hour
,
while
you
played
with
Adele
in
the
gallery
.
It
was
a
snowy
day
,
I
*NL*
recollect
,
and
you
could
not
go
out
of
doors
.
I
was
in
my
room
;
the
door
*NL*
was
ajar
:
I
could
both
listen
and
watch
.
Adele
claimed
your
outward
*NL*
attention
for
a
while
;
yet
I
fancied
your
thoughts
were
elsewhere
:
but
*NL*
you
were
very
patient
with
her
,
my
little
Jane
;
you
talked
to
her
and
*NL*
amused
her
a
long
time
.
When
at
last
she
left
you
,
you
lapsed
at
once
*NL*
into
deep
reverie
:
you
betook
yourself
slowly
to
pace
the
gallery
.
Now
*NL*
and
then
,
in
passing
a
casement
,
you
glanced
out
at
the
thick-falling
*NL*
snow
;
you
listened
to
the
sobbing
wind
,
and
again
you
paced
gently
on
and
*NL*
dreamed
.
I
think
those
day
visions
were
not
dark
:
there
was
a
*NL*
pleasurable
illumination
in
your
eye
occasionally
,
a
soft
excitement
in
*NL*
your
aspect
,
which
told
of
no
bitter
,
bilious
,
hypochondriac
brooding
:
*NL*
your
look
revealed
rather
the
sweet
musings
of
youth
when
its
spirit
*NL*
follows
on
willing
wings
the
flight
of
Hope
up
and
on
to
an
ideal
heaven
.
*NL*
The
voice
of
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
speaking
to
a
servant
in
the
hall
,
wakened
*NL*
you
:
and
how
curiously
you
smiled
to
and
at
yourself
,
Janet
!
There
was
*NL*
much
sense
in
your
smile
:
it
was
very
shrewd
,
and
seemed
to
make
light
of
*NL*
your
own
abstraction
.
It
seemed
to
say
--
`
My
fine
visions
are
all
very
*NL*
well
,
but
I
must
not
forget
they
are
absolutely
unreal
.
I
have
a
rosy
*NL*
sky
and
a
green
flowery
Eden
in
my
brain
;
but
without
,
I
am
perfectly
*NL*
aware
,
lies
at
my
feet
a
rough
tract
to
travel
,
and
around
me
gather
*NL*
black
tempests
to
encounter
.
'
You
ran
downstairs
and
demanded
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Fairfax
some
occupation
:
the
weekly
house
accounts
to
make
up
,
or
*NL*
something
of
that
sort
,
I
think
it
was
.
I
was
vexed
with
you
for
getting
*NL*
out
of
my
sight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Impatiently
I
waited
for
evening
,
when
I
might
summon
you
to
my
*NL*
presence
.
An
unusual
--
to
me
--
a
perfectly
new
character
I
suspected
was
*NL*
yours
:
I
desired
to
search
it
deeper
and
know
it
better
.
You
entered
the
*NL*
room
with
a
look
and
air
at
once
shy
and
independent
:
you
were
quaintly
*NL*
dressed
--
much
as
you
are
now
.
I
made
you
talk
:
ere
long
I
found
you
full
*NL*
of
strange
contrasts
.
Your
garb
and
manner
were
restricted
by
rule
;
your
*NL*
air
was
often
diffident
,
and
altogether
that
of
one
refined
by
nature
,
*NL*
but
absolutely
unused
to
society
,
and
a
good
deal
afraid
of
making
*NL*
herself
disadvantageously
conspicuous
by
some
solecism
or
blunder
;
yet
*NL*
when
addressed
,
you
lifted
a
keen
,
a
daring
,
and
a
glowing
eye
to
your
*NL*
interlocutor
's
face
:
there
was
penetration
and
power
in
each
glance
you
*NL*
gave
;
when
plied
by
close
questions
,
you
found
ready
and
round
answers
.
*NL*
Very
soon
you
seemed
to
get
used
to
me
:
I
believe
you
felt
the
existence
*NL*
of
sympathy
between
you
and
your
grim
and
cross
master
,
Jane
;
for
it
was
*NL*
astonishing
to
see
how
quickly
a
certain
pleasant
ease
tranquillised
your
*NL*
manner
:
snarl
as
I
would
,
you
showed
no
surprise
,
fear
,
annoyance
,
or
*NL*
displeasure
at
my
moroseness
;
you
watched
me
,
and
now
and
then
smiled
at
*NL*
me
with
a
simple
yet
sagacious
grace
I
can
not
describe
.
I
was
at
once
*NL*
content
and
stimulated
with
what
I
saw
:
I
liked
what
I
had
seen
,
and
*NL*
wished
to
see
more
.
Yet
,
for
a
long
time
,
I
treated
you
distantly
,
and
*NL*
sought
your
company
rarely
.
I
was
an
intellectual
epicure
,
and
wished
to
*NL*
prolong
the
gratification
of
making
this
novel
and
piquant
acquaintance
:
*NL*
besides
,
I
was
for
a
while
troubled
with
a
haunting
fear
that
if
I
*NL*
handled
the
flower
freely
its
bloom
would
fade
--
the
sweet
charm
of
*NL*
freshness
would
leave
it
.
I
did
not
then
know
that
it
was
no
transitory
*NL*
blossom
,
but
rather
the
radiant
resemblance
of
one
,
cut
in
an
*NL*
indestructible
gem
.
Moreover
,
I
wished
to
see
whether
you
would
seek
me
*NL*
if
I
shunned
you
--
but
you
did
not
;
you
kept
in
the
schoolroom
as
still
as
*NL*
your
own
desk
and
easel
;
if
by
chance
I
met
you
,
you
passed
me
as
soon
,
*NL*
and
with
as
little
token
of
recognition
,
as
was
consistent
with
respect
.
*NL*
Your
habitual
expression
in
those
days
,
Jane
,
was
a
thoughtful
look
;
not
*NL*
despondent
,
for
you
were
not
sickly
;
but
not
buoyant
,
for
you
had
little
*NL*
hope
,
and
no
actual
pleasure
.
I
wondered
what
you
thought
of
me
,
or
if
*NL*
you
ever
thought
of
me
,
and
resolved
to
find
this
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
resumed
my
notice
of
you
.
There
was
something
glad
in
your
glance
,
*NL*
and
genial
in
your
manner
,
when
you
conversed
:
I
saw
you
had
a
social
*NL*
heart
;
it
was
the
silent
schoolroom
--
it
was
the
tedium
of
your
life
--
that
*NL*
made
you
mournful
.
I
permitted
myself
the
delight
of
being
kind
to
you
;
*NL*
kindness
stirred
emotion
soon
:
your
face
became
soft
in
expression
,
your
*NL*
tones
gentle
;
I
liked
my
name
pronounced
by
your
lips
in
a
grateful
happy
*NL*
accent
.
I
used
to
enjoy
a
chance
meeting
with
you
,
Jane
,
at
this
time
:
*NL*
there
was
a
curious
hesitation
in
your
manner
:
you
glanced
at
me
with
a
*NL*
slight
trouble
--
a
hovering
doubt
:
you
did
not
know
what
my
caprice
might
*NL*
be
--
whether
I
was
going
to
play
the
master
and
be
stern
,
or
the
friend
*NL*
and
be
benignant
.
I
was
now
too
fond
of
you
often
to
simulate
the
first
*NL*
whim
;
and
,
when
I
stretched
my
hand
out
cordially
,
such
bloom
and
light
*NL*
and
bliss
rose
to
your
young
,
wistful
features
,
I
had
much
ado
often
to
*NL*
avoid
straining
you
then
and
there
to
my
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
talk
any
more
of
those
days
,
sir
,
''
I
interrupted
,
furtively
*NL*
dashing
away
some
tears
from
my
eyes
;
his
language
was
torture
to
me
;
for
*NL*
I
knew
what
I
must
do
--
and
do
soon
--
and
all
these
reminiscences
,
and
*NL*
these
revelations
of
his
feelings
only
made
my
work
more
difficult
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Jane
,
''
he
returned
:
``
what
necessity
is
there
to
dwell
on
the
Past
,
*NL*
when
the
Present
is
so
much
surer
--
the
Future
so
much
brighter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
shuddered
to
hear
the
infatuated
assertion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
now
how
the
case
stands
--
do
you
not
?
''
he
continued
.
``
After
a
*NL*
youth
and
manhood
passed
half
in
unutterable
misery
and
half
in
dreary
*NL*
solitude
,
I
have
for
the
first
time
found
what
I
can
truly
love
--
I
have
*NL*
found
you
.
You
are
my
sympathy
--
my
better
self
--
my
good
angel
.
I
am
*NL*
bound
to
you
with
a
strong
attachment
.
I
think
you
good
,
gifted
,
lovely
:
*NL*
a
fervent
,
a
solemn
passion
is
conceived
in
my
heart
;
it
leans
to
you
,
*NL*
draws
you
to
my
centre
and
spring
of
life
,
wraps
my
existence
about
you
,
*NL*
and
,
kindling
in
pure
,
powerful
flame
,
fuses
you
and
me
in
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
because
I
felt
and
knew
this
,
that
I
resolved
to
marry
you
.
To
*NL*
tell
me
that
I
had
already
a
wife
is
empty
mockery
:
you
know
now
that
I
*NL*
had
but
a
hideous
demon
.
I
was
wrong
to
attempt
to
deceive
you
;
but
I
*NL*
feared
a
stubbornness
that
exists
in
your
character
.
I
feared
early
*NL*
instilled
prejudice
:
I
wanted
to
have
you
safe
before
hazarding
*NL*
confidences
.
This
was
cowardly
:
I
should
have
appealed
to
your
nobleness
*NL*
and
magnanimity
at
first
,
as
I
do
now
--
opened
to
you
plainly
my
life
of
*NL*
agony
--
described
to
you
my
hunger
and
thirst
after
a
higher
and
worthier
*NL*
existence
--
shown
to
you
,
not
my
_
resolution

-LRB-
that
word
is
weak
-RRB-
,
but
my
*NL*
resistless
_
bent
_
to
love
faithfully
and
well
,
where
I
am
faithfully
and
*NL*
well
loved
in
return
.
Then
I
should
have
asked
you
to
accept
my
pledge
*NL*
of
fidelity
and
to
give
me
yours
.
Jane
--
give
it
me
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
are
you
silent
,
Jane
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
experiencing
an
ordeal
:
a
hand
of
fiery
iron
grasped
my
vitals
.
*NL*
Terrible
moment
:
full
of
struggle
,
blackness
,
burning
!
Not
a
human
being
*NL*
that
ever
lived
could
wish
to
be
loved
better
than
I
was
loved
;
and
him
*NL*
who
thus
loved
me
I
absolutely
worshipped
:
and
I
must
renounce
love
and
*NL*
idol
.
One
drear
word
comprised
my
intolerable
duty
--
``
Depart
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jane
,
you
understand
what
I
want
of
you

Just
this
promise

Mr.
Rochester

*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.

Another
long
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jane
!
''
recommenced
he
,
with
a
gentleness
that
broke
me
down
with
grief
,
*NL*
and
turned
me
stone-cold
with
ominous
terror
--
for
this
still
voice
was
*NL*
the
pant
of
a
lion
rising
--
``
Jane

you
mean

go
one
way

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

*NL*
*NL*
``

-LRB-
bending

*NL*
*NL*
``

``
And

softly
kissing
my
forehead
and
cheek
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do

''
extricating
myself
from
restraint
rapidly
and
completely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

this
is
bitter
!
This

wicked

not

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
to
obey
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
A
wild
look
raised
his
brows
--
crossed
his
features
:
he
rose
;
but
he
*NL*
forebore
yet
.
I
laid
my
hand
on
the
back
of
a
chair
for
support
:
I
*NL*
shook
,
I
feared
--
but
I
resolved
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
instant
,
Jane
.
Give
one
glance
to
my
horrible
life
when
you
are
*NL*
gone
.
All
happiness
will
be
torn
away
with
you
.
What
then
is
left
?
For
*NL*
a
wife
I
have
but
the
maniac
upstairs
:
as
well
might
you
refer
me
to
some
*NL*
corpse
in
yonder
churchyard
.
What
shall
I
do
,
Jane
?
Where
turn
for
a
*NL*
companion
and
for
some
hope
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
as
I
do
:
trust
in
God
and
yourself
.
Believe
in
heaven
.
Hope
to
meet
*NL*
again
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
will
not
yield
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
condemn
me
to
live
wretched
and
to
die
accursed
?
''
His
voice
*NL*
rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
advise
you
to
live
sinless
,
and
I
wish
you
to
die
tranquil
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
snatch
love
and
innocence
from
me
?
You
fling
me
back
on
lust
*NL*
for
a
passion
--
vice
for
an
occupation
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Rochester
,
I
no
more
assign
this
fate
to
you
than
I
grasp
at
it
for
*NL*
myself
.
We
were
born
to
strive
and
endure
--
you
as
well
as
I
:
do
so
.
You
*NL*
will
forget
me
before
I
forget
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
make
me
a
liar
by
such
language
:
you
sully
my
honour
.
I
declared
I
*NL*
could
not
change
:
you
tell
me
to
my
face
I
shall
change
soon
.
And
what
a
*NL*
distortion
in
your
judgment
,
what
a
perversity
in
your
ideas
,
is
proved
*NL*
by
your
conduct
!
Is
it
better
to
drive
a
fellow-creature
to
despair
than
*NL*
to
transgress
a
mere
human
law
,
no
man
being
injured
by
the
breach
?
for
*NL*
you
have
neither
relatives
nor
acquaintances
whom
you
need
fear
to
offend
*NL*
by
living
with
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
true
:
and
while
he
spoke
my
very
conscience
and
reason
turned
*NL*
traitors
against
me
,
and
charged
me
with
crime
in
resisting
him
.
They
*NL*
spoke
almost
as
loud
as
Feeling
:
and
that
clamoured
wildly
.
``
Oh
,
*NL*
comply
!
''
it
said
.
``
Think
of
his
misery
;
think
of
his
danger
--
look
at
his
*NL*
state
when
left
alone
;
remember
his
headlong
nature
;
consider
the
*NL*
recklessness
following
on
despair
--
soothe
him
;
save
him
;
love
him
;
tell
*NL*
him
you
love
him
and
will
be
his
.
Who
in
the
world
cares
for
_
you
_
?
or
*NL*
who
will
be
injured
by
what
you
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Still
indomitable
was
the
reply
--
''
_
I
_
care
for
myself
.
The
more
*NL*
solitary
,
the
more
friendless
,
the
more
unsustained
I
am
,
the
more
I
will
*NL*
respect
myself
.
I
will
keep
the
law
given
by
God
;
sanctioned
by
man
.
I
*NL*
will
hold
to
the
principles
received
by
me
when
I
was
sane
,
and
not
*NL*
mad
--
as
I
am
now
.
Laws
and
principles
are
not
for
the
times
when
there
*NL*
is
no
temptation
:
they
are
for
such
moments
as
this
,
when
body
and
soul
*NL*
rise
in
mutiny
against
their
rigour
;
stringent
are
they
;
inviolate
they
*NL*
shall
be
.
If
at
my
individual
convenience
I
might
break
them
,
what
would
*NL*
be
their
worth
?
They
have
a
worth
--
so
I
have
always
believed
;
and
if
I
*NL*
can
not
believe
it
now
,
it
is
because
I
am
insane
--
quite
insane
:
with
my
*NL*
veins
running
fire
,
and
my
heart
beating
faster
than
I
can
count
its
*NL*
throbs
.
Preconceived
opinions
,
foregone
determinations
,
are
all
I
have
*NL*
at
this
hour
to
stand
by
:
there
I
plant
my
foot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
.
Mr.
Rochester
,
reading
my
countenance
,
saw
I
had
done
so
.
His
*NL*
fury
was
wrought
to
the
highest
:
he
must
yield
to
it
for
a
moment
,
*NL*
whatever
followed
;
he
crossed
the
floor
and
seized
my
arm
and
grasped
my
*NL*
waist
.
He
seemed
to
devour
me
with
his
flaming
glance
:
physically
,
I
*NL*
felt
,
at
the
moment
,
powerless
as
stubble
exposed
to
the
draught
and
glow
*NL*
of
a
furnace
:
mentally
,
I
still
possessed
my
soul
,
and
with
it
the
*NL*
certainty
of
ultimate
safety
.
The
soul
,
fortunately
,
has
an
*NL*
interpreter
--
often
an
unconscious
,
but
still
a
truthful
interpreter
--
in
*NL*
the
eye
.
My
eye
rose
to
his
;
and
while
I
looked
in
his
fierce
face
I
*NL*
gave
an
involuntary
sigh
;
his
gripe
was
painful
,
and
my
over-taxed
*NL*
strength
almost
exhausted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
,
''
said
he
,
as
he
ground
his
teeth
,
``
never
was
anything
at
once
so
*NL*
frail
and
so
indomitable
.
A
mere
reed
she
feels
in
my
hand
!
''
-LRB-
And
he
*NL*
shook
me
with
the
force
of
his
hold
.
-RRB-
``
I
could
bend
her
with
my
finger
*NL*
and
thumb
:
and
what
good
would
it
do
if
I
bent
,
if
I
uptore
,
if
I
crushed
*NL*
her
?
Consider
that
eye
:
consider
the
resolute
,
wild
,
free
thing
looking
*NL*
out
of
it
,
defying
me
,
with
more
than
courage
--
with
a
stern
triumph
.
*NL*
Whatever
I
do
with
its
cage
,
I
can
not
get
at
it
--
the
savage
,
beautiful
*NL*
creature
!
If
I
tear
,
if
I
rend
the
slight
prison
,
my
outrage
will
only
*NL*
let
the
captive
loose
.
Conqueror
I
might
be
of
the
house
;
but
the
inmate
*NL*
would
escape
to
heaven
before
I
could
call
myself
possessor
of
its
clay
*NL*
dwelling-place
.
And
it
is
you
,
spirit
--
with
will
and
energy
,
and
virtue
*NL*
and
purity
--
that
I
want
:
not
alone
your
brittle
frame
.
Of
yourself
you
*NL*
could
come
with
soft
flight
and
nestle
against
my
heart
,
if
you
would
:
*NL*
seized
against
your
will
,
you
will
elude
the
grasp
like
an
essence
--
you
*NL*
will
vanish
ere
I
inhale
your
fragrance
.
Oh
!
come
,
Jane
,
come
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
said
this
,
he
released
me
from
his
clutch
,
and
only
looked
at
me
.
*NL*
The
look
was
far
worse
to
resist
than
the
frantic
strain
:
only
an
idiot
,
*NL*
however
,
would
have
succumbed
now
.
I
had
dared
and
baffled
his
fury
;
I
*NL*
must
elude
his
sorrow
:
I
retired
to
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
going
,
Jane
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
leaving
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
not
come
?
You
will
not
be
my
comforter
,
my
rescuer
?
My
deep
*NL*
love
,
my
wild
woe
,
my
frantic
prayer
,
are
all
nothing
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
unutterable
pathos
was
in
his
voice
!
How
hard
it
was
to
reiterate
*NL*
firmly
,
``
I
am
going
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jane
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Rochester
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Withdraw
,
then
,
--
I
consent
;
but
remember
,
you
leave
me
here
in
anguish
.
*NL*
Go
up
to
your
own
room
;
think
over
all
I
have
said
,
and
,
Jane
,
cast
a
*NL*
glance
on
my
sufferings
--
think
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
away
;
he
threw
himself
on
his
face
on
the
sofa
.
``
Oh
,
Jane
!
my
*NL*
hope
--
my
love
--
my
life
!
''
broke
in
anguish
from
his
lips
.
Then
came
a
*NL*
deep
,
strong
sob
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
already
gained
the
door
;
but
,
reader
,
I
walked
back
--
walked
back
as
*NL*
determinedly
as
I
had
retreated
.
I
knelt
down
by
him
;
I
turned
his
face
*NL*
from
the
cushion
to
me
;
I
kissed
his
cheek
;
I
smoothed
his
hair
with
my
*NL*
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
bless
you
,
my
dear
master
!
''
I
said
.
``
God
keep
you
from
harm
and
*NL*
wrong
--
direct
you
,
solace
you
--
reward
you
well
for
your
past
kindness
to
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Little
Jane
's
love
would
have
been
my
best
reward
,
''
he
answered
;
*NL*
``
without
it
,
my
heart
is
broken
.
But
Jane
will
give
me
her
love
:
*NL*
yes
--
nobly
,
generously
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Up
the
blood
rushed
to
his
face
;
forth
flashed
the
fire
from
his
eyes
;
*NL*
erect
he
sprang
;
he
held
his
arms
out
;
but
I
evaded
the
embrace
,
and
at
*NL*
once
quitted
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Farewell
!
''
was
the
cry
of
my
heart
as
I
left
him
.
Despair
added
,
*NL*
``
Farewell
for
ever
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
That
night
I
never
thought
to
sleep
;
but
a
slumber
fell
on
me
as
soon
as
*NL*
I
lay
down
in
bed
.
I
was
transported
in
thought
to
the
scenes
of
*NL*
childhood
:
I
dreamt
I
lay
in
the
red-room
at
Gateshead
;
that
the
night
*NL*
was
dark
,
and
my
mind
impressed
with
strange
fears
.
The
light
that
long
*NL*
ago
had
struck
me
into
syncope
,
recalled
in
this
vision
,
seemed
glidingly
*NL*
to
mount
the
wall
,
and
tremblingly
to
pause
in
the
centre
of
the
obscured
*NL*
ceiling
.
I
lifted
up
my
head
to
look
:
the
roof
resolved
to
clouds
,
high
*NL*
and
dim
;
the
gleam
was
such
as
the
moon
imparts
to
vapours
she
is
about
*NL*
to
sever
.
I
watched
her
come
--
watched
with
the
strangest
anticipation
;
*NL*
as
though
some
word
of
doom
were
to
be
written
on
her
disk
.
She
broke
*NL*
forth
as
never
moon
yet
burst
from
cloud
:
a
hand
first
penetrated
the
*NL*
sable
folds
and
waved
them
away
;
then
,
not
a
moon
,
but
a
white
human
form
*NL*
shone
in
the
azure
,
inclining
a
glorious
brow
earthward
.
It
gazed
and
*NL*
gazed
on
me
.
It
spoke
to
my
spirit
:
immeasurably
distant
was
the
tone
,
*NL*
yet
so
near
,
it
whispered
in
my
heart
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
daughter
,
flee
temptation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
,
I
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
I
answered
after
I
had
waked
from
the
trance-like
dream
.
It
was
yet
*NL*
night
,
but
July
nights
are
short
:
soon
after
midnight
,
dawn
comes
.
``
It
*NL*
can
not
be
too
early
to
commence
the
task
I
have
to
fulfil
,
''
thought
I.
I
*NL*
rose
:
I
was
dressed
;
for
I
had
taken
off
nothing
but
my
shoes
.
I
knew
*NL*
where
to
find
in
my
drawers
some
linen
,
a
locket
,
a
ring
.
In
seeking
*NL*
these
articles
,
I
encountered
the
beads
of
a
pearl
necklace
Mr.
Rochester
*NL*
had
forced
me
to
accept
a
few
days
ago
.
I
left
that
;
it
was
not
mine
:
it
*NL*
was
the
visionary
bride
's
who
had
melted
in
air
.
The
other
articles
I
*NL*
made
up
in
a
parcel
;
my
purse
,
containing
twenty
shillings
-LRB-
it
was
all
I
*NL*
had
-RRB-
,
I
put
in
my
pocket
:
I
tied
on
my
straw
bonnet
,
pinned
my
shawl
,
*NL*
took
the
parcel
and
my
slippers
,
which
I
would
not
put
on
yet
,
and
stole
*NL*
from
my
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Farewell
,
kind
Mrs.
Fairfax
!
''
I
whispered
,
as
I
glided
past
her
door
.
*NL*
``
Farewell
,
my
darling
Adele
!
''
I
said
,
as
I
glanced
towards
the
nursery
.
*NL*
No
thought
could
be
admitted
of
entering
to
embrace
her
.
I
had
to
*NL*
deceive
a
fine
ear
:
for
aught
I
knew
it
might
now
be
listening
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
would
have
got
past
Mr.
Rochester
's
chamber
without
a
pause
;
but
my
*NL*
heart
momentarily
stopping
its
beat
at
that
threshold
,
my
foot
was
forced
*NL*
to
stop
also
.
No
sleep
was
there
:
the
inmate
was
walking
restlessly
from
*NL*
wall
to
wall
;
and
again
and
again
he
sighed
while
I
listened
.
There
was
*NL*
a
heaven
--
a
temporary
heaven
--
in
this
room
for
me
,
if
I
chose
:
I
had
but
*NL*
to
go
in
and
to
say
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Rochester
,
I
will
love
you
and
live
with
you
through
life
till
*NL*
death
,
''
and
a
fount
of
rapture
would
spring
to
my
lips
.
I
thought
of
*NL*
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
kind
master
,
who
could
not
sleep
now
,
was
waiting
with
impatience
*NL*
for
day
.
He
would
send
for
me
in
the
morning
;
I
should
be
gone
.
He
*NL*
would
have
me
sought
for
:
vainly
.
He
would
feel
himself
forsaken
;
his
*NL*
love
rejected
:
he
would
suffer
;
perhaps
grow
desperate
.
I
thought
of
*NL*
this
too
.
My
hand
moved
towards
the
lock
:
I
caught
it
back
,
and
glided
*NL*
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Drearily
I
wound
my
way
downstairs
:
I
knew
what
I
had
to
do
,
and
I
did
it
*NL*
mechanically
.
I
sought
the
key
of
the
side-door
in
the
kitchen
;
I
*NL*
sought
,
too
,
a
phial
of
oil
and
a
feather
;
I
oiled
the
key
and
the
lock
.
*NL*
I
got
some
water
,
I
got
some
bread
:
for
perhaps
I
should
have
to
walk
*NL*
far
;
and
my
strength
,
sorely
shaken
of
late
,
must
not
break
down
.
All
*NL*
this
I
did
without
one
sound
.
I
opened
the
door
,
passed
out
,
shut
it
*NL*
softly
.
Dim
dawn
glimmered
in
the
yard
.
The
great
gates
were
closed
and
*NL*
locked
;
but
a
wicket
in
one
of
them
was
only
latched
.
Through
that
I
*NL*
departed
:
it
,
too
,
I
shut
;
and
now
I
was
out
of
Thornfield
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
mile
off
,
beyond
the
fields
,
lay
a
road
which
stretched
in
the
contrary
*NL*
direction
to
Millcote
;
a
road
I
had
never
travelled
,
but
often
noticed
,
*NL*
and
wondered
where
it
led
:
thither
I
bent
my
steps
.
No
reflection
was
to
*NL*
be
allowed
now
:
not
one
glance
was
to
be
cast
back
;
not
even
one
forward
.
*NL*
Not
one
thought
was
to
be
given
either
to
the
past
or
the
future
.
The
*NL*
first
was
a
page
so
heavenly
sweet
--
so
deadly
sad
--
that
to
read
one
line
*NL*
of
it
would
dissolve
my
courage
and
break
down
my
energy
.
The
last
was
*NL*
an
awful
blank
:
something
like
the
world
when
the
deluge
was
gone
by
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
skirted
fields
,
and
hedges
,
and
lanes
till
after
sunrise
.
I
believe
it
*NL*
was
a
lovely
summer
morning
:
I
know
my
shoes
,
which
I
had
put
on
when
I
*NL*
left
the
house
,
were
soon
wet
with
dew
.
But
I
looked
neither
to
rising
*NL*
sun
,
nor
smiling
sky
,
nor
wakening
nature
.
He
who
is
taken
out
to
pass
*NL*
through
a
fair
scene
to
the
scaffold
,
thinks
not
of
the
flowers
that
*NL*
smile
on
his
road
,
but
of
the
block
and
axe-edge
;
of
the
disseverment
of
*NL*
bone
and
vein
;
of
the
grave
gaping
at
the
end
:
and
I
thought
of
drear
*NL*
flight
and
homeless
wandering
--
and
oh
!
with
agony
I
thought
of
what
I
*NL*
left
.
I
could
not
help
it
.
I
thought
of
him
now
--
in
his
room
--
watching
*NL*
the
sunrise
;
hoping
I
should
soon
come
to
say
I
would
stay
with
him
and
*NL*
be
his
.
I
longed
to
be
his
;
I
panted
to
return
:
it
was
not
too
late
;
I
*NL*
could
yet
spare
him
the
bitter
pang
of
bereavement
.
As
yet
my
flight
,
I
*NL*
was
sure
,
was
undiscovered
.
I
could
go
back
and
be
his
comforter
--
his
*NL*
pride
;
his
redeemer
from
misery
,
perhaps
from
ruin
.
Oh
,
that
fear
of
his
*NL*
self-abandonment
--
far
worse
than
my
abandonment
--
how
it
goaded
me
!
It
*NL*
was
a
barbed
arrow-head
in
my
breast
;
it
tore
me
when
I
tried
to
extract
*NL*
it
;
it
sickened
me
when
remembrance
thrust
it
farther
in
.
Birds
began
*NL*
singing
in
brake
and
copse
:
birds
were
faithful
to
their
mates
;
birds
*NL*
were
emblems
of
love
.
What
was
I
?
In
the
midst
of
my
pain
of
heart
and
*NL*
frantic
effort
of
principle
,
I
abhorred
myself
.
I
had
no
solace
from
*NL*
self-approbation
:
none
even
from
self-respect
.
I
had
*NL*
injured
--
wounded
--
left
my
master
.
I
was
hateful
in
my
own
eyes
.
Still
I
*NL*
could
not
turn
,
nor
retrace
one
step
.
God
must
have
led
me
on
.
As
to
my
*NL*
own
will
or
conscience
,
impassioned
grief
had
trampled
one
and
stifled
*NL*
the
other
.
I
was
weeping
wildly
as
I
walked
along
my
solitary
way
:
fast
,
*NL*
fast
I
went
like
one
delirious
.
A
weakness
,
beginning
inwardly
,
*NL*
extending
to
the
limbs
,
seized
me
,
and
I
fell
:
I
lay
on
the
ground
some
*NL*
minutes
,
pressing
my
face
to
the
wet
turf
.
I
had
some
fear
--
or
hope
--
that
*NL*
here
I
should
die
:
but
I
was
soon
up
;
crawling
forwards
on
my
hands
and
*NL*
knees
,
and
then
again
raised
to
my
feet
--
as
eager
and
as
determined
as
*NL*
ever
to
reach
the
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
got
there
,
I
was
forced
to
sit
to
rest
me
under
the
hedge
;
and
*NL*
while
I
sat
,
I
heard
wheels
,
and
saw
a
coach
come
on
.
I
stood
up
and
*NL*
lifted
my
hand
;
it
stopped
.
I
asked
where
it
was
going
:
the
driver
named
*NL*
a
place
a
long
way
off
,
and
where
I
was
sure
Mr.
Rochester
had
no
*NL*
connections
.
I
asked
for
what
sum
he
would
take
me
there
;
he
said
thirty
*NL*
shillings
;
I
answered
I
had
but
twenty
;
well
,
he
would
try
to
make
it
do
.
*NL*
He
further
gave
me
leave
to
get
into
the
inside
,
as
the
vehicle
was
*NL*
empty
:
I
entered
,
was
shut
in
,
and
it
rolled
on
its
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gentle
reader
,
may
you
never
feel
what
I
then
felt
!
May
your
eyes
never
*NL*
shed
such
stormy
,
scalding
,
heart-wrung
tears
as
poured
from
mine
.
May
*NL*
you
never
appeal
to
Heaven
in
prayers
so
hopeless
and
so
agonised
as
in
*NL*
that
hour
left
my
lips
;
for
never
may
you
,
like
me
,
dread
to
be
the
*NL*
instrument
of
evil
to
what
you
wholly
love
.

CHAPTER
XXVIII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Two
days
are
passed
.
It
is
a
summer
evening
;
the
coachman
has
set
me
*NL*
down
at
a
place
called
Whitcross
;
he
could
take
me
no
farther
for
the
sum
*NL*
I
had
given
,
and
I
was
not
possessed
of
another
shilling
in
the
world
.
*NL*
The
coach
is
a
mile
off
by
this
time
;
I
am
alone
.
At
this
moment
I
*NL*
discover
that
I
forgot
to
take
my
parcel
out
of
the
pocket
of
the
coach
,
*NL*
where
I
had
placed
it
for
safety
;
there
it
remains
,
there
it
must
remain
;
*NL*
and
now
,
I
am
absolutely
destitute
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whitcross
is
no
town
,
nor
even
a
hamlet
;
it
is
but
a
stone
pillar
set
up
*NL*
where
four
roads
meet
:
whitewashed
,
I
suppose
,
to
be
more
obvious
at
a
*NL*
distance
and
in
darkness
.
Four
arms
spring
from
its
summit
:
the
nearest
*NL*
town
to
which
these
point
is
,
according
to
the
inscription
,
distant
ten
*NL*
miles
;
the
farthest
,
above
twenty
.
From
the
well-known
names
of
these
*NL*
towns
I
learn
in
what
county
I
have
lighted
;
a
north-midland
shire
,
dusk
*NL*
with
moorland
,
ridged
with
mountain
:
this
I
see
.
There
are
great
moors
*NL*
behind
and
on
each
hand
of
me
;
there
are
waves
of
mountains
far
beyond
*NL*
that
deep
valley
at
my
feet
.
The
population
here
must
be
thin
,
and
I
see
*NL*
no
passengers
on
these
roads
:
they
stretch
out
east
,
west
,
north
,
and
*NL*
south
--
white
,
broad
,
lonely
;
they
are
all
cut
in
the
moor
,
and
the
*NL*
heather
grows
deep
and
wild
to
their
very
verge
.
Yet
a
chance
traveller
*NL*
might
pass
by
;
and
I
wish
no
eye
to
see
me
now
:
strangers
would
wonder
*NL*
what
I
am
doing
,
lingering
here
at
the
sign-post
,
evidently
objectless
*NL*
and
lost
.
I
might
be
questioned
:
I
could
give
no
answer
but
what
would
*NL*
sound
incredible
and
excite
suspicion
.
Not
a
tie
holds
me
to
human
*NL*
society
at
this
moment
--
not
a
charm
or
hope
calls
me
where
my
*NL*
fellow-creatures
are
--
none
that
saw
me
would
have
a
kind
thought
or
a
*NL*
good
wish
for
me
.
I
have
no
relative
but
the
universal
mother
,
Nature
:
I
*NL*
will
seek
her
breast
and
ask
repose
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
struck
straight
into
the
heath
;
I
held
on
to
a
hollow
I
saw
deeply
*NL*
furrowing
the
brown
moorside
;
I
waded
knee-deep
in
its
dark
growth
;
I
*NL*
turned
with
its
turnings
,
and
finding
a
moss-blackened
granite
crag
in
a
*NL*
hidden
angle
,
I
sat
down
under
it
.
High
banks
of
moor
were
about
me
;
the
*NL*
crag
protected
my
head
:
the
sky
was
over
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
time
passed
before
I
felt
tranquil
even
here
:
I
had
a
vague
dread
*NL*
that
wild
cattle
might
be
near
,
or
that
some
sportsman
or
poacher
might
*NL*
discover
me
.
If
a
gust
of
wind
swept
the
waste
,
I
looked
up
,
fearing
it
*NL*
was
the
rush
of
a
bull
;
if
a
plover
whistled
,
I
imagined
it
a
man
.
*NL*
Finding
my
apprehensions
unfounded
,
however
,
and
calmed
by
the
deep
*NL*
silence
that
reigned
as
evening
declined
at
nightfall
,
I
took
confidence
.
*NL*
As
yet
I
had
not
thought
;
I
had
only
listened
,
watched
,
dreaded
;
now
I
*NL*
regained
the
faculty
of
reflection
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
I
to
do
?
Where
to
go
?
Oh
,
intolerable
questions
,
when
I
could
*NL*
do
nothing
and
go
nowhere
!
--
when
a
long
way
must
yet
be
measured
by
my
*NL*
weary
,
trembling
limbs
before
I
could
reach
human
habitation
--
when
cold
*NL*
charity
must
be
entreated
before
I
could
get
a
lodging
:
reluctant
*NL*
sympathy
importuned
,
almost
certain
repulse
incurred
,
before
my
tale
*NL*
could
be
listened
to
,
or
one
of
my
wants
relieved
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
touched
the
heath
:
it
was
dry
,
and
yet
warm
with
the
heat
of
the
summer
*NL*
day
.
I
looked
at
the
sky
;
it
was
pure
:
a
kindly
star
twinkled
just
above
*NL*
the
chasm
ridge
.
The
dew
fell
,
but
with
propitious
softness
;
no
breeze
*NL*
whispered
.
Nature
seemed
to
me
benign
and
good
;
I
thought
she
loved
me
,
*NL*
outcast
as
I
was
;
and
I
,
who
from
man
could
anticipate
only
mistrust
,
*NL*
rejection
,
insult
,
clung
to
her
with
filial
fondness
.
To-night
,
at
*NL*
least
,
I
would
be
her
guest
,
as
I
was
her
child
:
my
mother
would
lodge
me
*NL*
without
money
and
without
price
.
I
had
one
morsel
of
bread
yet
:
the
*NL*
remnant
of
a
roll
I
had
bought
in
a
town
we
passed
through
at
noon
with
a
*NL*
stray
penny
--
my
last
coin
.
I
saw
ripe
bilberries
gleaming
here
and
*NL*
there
,
like
jet
beads
in
the
heath
:
I
gathered
a
handful
and
ate
them
*NL*
with
the
bread
.
My
hunger
,
sharp
before
,
was
,
if
not
satisfied
,
appeased
*NL*
by
this
hermit
's
meal
.
I
said
my
evening
prayers
at
its
conclusion
,
and
*NL*
then
chose
my
couch
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LCB-
I
said
my
evening
prayers
:

-RCB-
*NL*
*NL*
Beside
the
crag
the
heath
was
very
deep
:
when
I
lay
down
my
feet
were
*NL*
buried
in
it
;
rising
high
on
each
side
,
it
left
only
a
narrow
space
for
*NL*
the
night-air
to
invade
.
I
folded
my
shawl
double
,
and
spread
it
over
me
*NL*
for
a
coverlet
;
a
low
,
mossy
swell
was
my
pillow
.
Thus
lodged
,
I
was
*NL*
not
,
at
least
--
at
the
commencement
of
the
night
,
cold
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
rest
might
have
been
blissful
enough
,
only
a
sad
heart
broke
it
.
It
*NL*
plained
of
its
gaping
wounds
,
its
inward
bleeding
,
its
riven
chords
.
It
*NL*
trembled
for
Mr.
Rochester
and
his
doom
;
it
bemoaned
him
with
bitter
*NL*
pity
;
it
demanded
him
with
ceaseless
longing
;
and
,
impotent
as
a
bird
*NL*
with
both
wings
broken
,
it
still
quivered
its
shattered
pinions
in
vain
*NL*
attempts
to
seek
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Worn
out
with
this
torture
of
thought
,
I
rose
to
my
knees
.
Night
was
*NL*
come
,
and
her
planets
were
risen
:
a
safe
,
still
night
:
too
serene
for
the
*NL*
companionship
of
fear
.
We
know
that
God
is
everywhere
;
but
certainly
we
*NL*
feel
His
presence
most
when
His
works
are
on
the
grandest
scale
spread
*NL*
before
us
;
and
it
is
in
the
unclouded
night-sky
,
where
His
worlds
wheel
*NL*
their
silent
course
,
that
we
read
clearest
His
infinitude
,
His
*NL*
omnipotence
,
His
omnipresence
.
I
had
risen
to
my
knees
to
pray
for
Mr.
*NL*
Rochester
.
Looking
up
,
I
,
with
tear-dimmed
eyes
,
saw
the
mighty
Milky
-
*NL*
way
.
Remembering
what
it
was
--
what
countless
systems
there
swept
space
*NL*
like
a
soft
trace
of
light
--
I
felt
the
might
and
strength
of
God
.
Sure
*NL*
was
I
of
His
efficiency
to
save
what
He
had
made
:
convinced
I
grew
that
*NL*
neither
earth
should
perish
,
nor
one
of
the
souls
it
treasured
.
I
turned
*NL*
my
prayer
to
thanksgiving
:
the
Source
of
Life
was
also
the
Saviour
of
*NL*
spirits
.
Mr.
Rochester
was
safe
;
he
was
God
's
,
and
by
God
would
he
be
*NL*
guarded
.
I
again
nestled
to
the
breast
of
the
hill
;
and
ere
long
in
*NL*
sleep
forgot
sorrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
next
day
,
Want
came
to
me
pale
and
bare
.
Long
after
the
little
birds
*NL*
had
left
their
nests
;
long
after
bees
had
come
in
the
sweet
prime
of
day
*NL*
to
gather
the
heath
honey
before
the
dew
was
dried
--
when
the
long
morning
*NL*
shadows
were
curtailed
,
and
the
sun
filled
earth
and
sky
--
I
got
up
,
and
I
*NL*
looked
round
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
a
still
,
hot
,
perfect
day
!
What
a
golden
desert
this
spreading
*NL*
moor
!
Everywhere
sunshine
.
I
wished
I
could
live
in
it
and
on
it
.
I
*NL*
saw
a
lizard
run
over
the
crag
;
I
saw
a
bee
busy
among
the
sweet
*NL*
bilberries
.
I
would
fain
at
the
moment
have
become
bee
or
lizard
,
that
I
*NL*
might
have
found
fitting
nutriment
,
permanent
shelter
here
.
But
I
was
a
*NL*
human
being
,
and
had
a
human
being
's
wants
:
I
must
not
linger
where
there
*NL*
was
nothing
to
supply
them
.
I
rose
;
I
looked
back
at
the
bed
I
had
left
.
*NL*
Hopeless
of
the
future
,
I
wished
but
this
--
that
my
Maker
had
that
night
*NL*
thought
good
to
require
my
soul
of
me
while
I
slept
;
and
that
this
weary
*NL*
frame
,
absolved
by
death
from
further
conflict
with
fate
,
had
now
but
to
*NL*
decay
quietly
,
and
mingle
in
peace
with
the
soil
of
this
wilderness
.
*NL*
Life
,
however
,
was
yet
in
my
possession
,
with
all
its
requirements
,
and
*NL*
pains
,
and
responsibilities
.
The
burden
must
be
carried
;
the
want
*NL*
provided
for
;
the
suffering
endured
;
the
responsibility
fulfilled
.
I
set
*NL*
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whitcross
regained
,
I
followed
a
road
which
led
from
the
sun
,
now
fervent
*NL*
and
high
.
By
no
other
circumstance
had
I
will
to
decide
my
choice
.
I
*NL*
walked
a
long
time
,
and
when
I
thought
I
had
nearly
done
enough
,
and
*NL*
might
conscientiously
yield
to
the
fatigue
that
almost
overpowered
*NL*
me
--
might
relax
this
forced
action
,
and
,
sitting
down
on
a
stone
I
saw
*NL*
near
,
submit
resistlessly
to
the
apathy
that
clogged
heart
and
limb
--
I
*NL*
heard
a
bell
chime
--
a
church
bell
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
,
and
there
,
amongst
the
romantic
*NL*
hills
,
whose
changes
and
aspect
I
had
ceased
to
note
an
hour
ago
,
I
saw
a
*NL*
hamlet
and
a
spire
.
All
the
valley
at
my
right
hand
was
full
of
pasture
-
*NL*
fields
,
and
cornfields
,
and
wood
;
and
a
glittering
stream
ran
zig-zag
*NL*
through
the
varied
shades
of
green
,
the
mellowing
grain
,
the
sombre
*NL*
woodland
,
the
clear
and
sunny
lea
.
Recalled
by
the
rumbling
of
wheels
to
*NL*
the
road
before
me
,
I
saw
a
heavily-laden
waggon
labouring
up
the
hill
,
*NL*
and
not
far
beyond
were
two
cows
and
their
drover
.
Human
life
and
human
*NL*
labour
were
near
.
I
must
struggle
on
:
strive
to
live
and
bend
to
toil
*NL*
like
the
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
two
o'clock
p.m.
I
entered
the
village
.
At
the
bottom
of
its
one
*NL*
street
there
was
a
little
shop
with
some
cakes
of
bread
in
the
window
.
I
*NL*
coveted
a
cake
of
bread
.
With
that
refreshment
I
could
perhaps
regain
a
*NL*
degree
of
energy
:
without
it
,
it
would
be
difficult
to
proceed
.
The
wish
*NL*
to
have
some
strength
and
some
vigour
returned
to
me
as
soon
as
I
was
*NL*
amongst
my
fellow-beings
.
I
felt
it
would
be
degrading
to
faint
with
*NL*
hunger
on
the
causeway
of
a
hamlet
.
Had
I
nothing
about
me
I
could
offer
*NL*
in
exchange
for
one
of
these
rolls
?
I
considered
.
I
had
a
small
silk
*NL*
handkerchief
tied
round
my
throat
;
I
had
my
gloves
.
I
could
hardly
tell
*NL*
how
men
and
women
in
extremities
of
destitution
proceeded
.
I
did
not
*NL*
know
whether
either
of
these
articles
would
be
accepted
:
probably
they
*NL*
would
not
;
but
I
must
try
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
entered
the
shop
:
a
woman
was
there
.
Seeing
a
respectably-dressed
*NL*
person
,
a
lady
as
she
supposed
,
she
came
forward
with
civility
.
How
*NL*
could
she
serve
me
?
I
was
seized
with
shame
:
my
tongue
would
not
utter
*NL*
the
request
I
had
prepared
.
I
dared
not
offer
her
the
half-worn
gloves
,
*NL*
the
creased
handkerchief
:
besides
,
I
felt
it
would
be
absurd
.
I
only
*NL*
begged
permission
to
sit
down
a
moment
,
as
I
was
tired
.
Disappointed
in
*NL*
the
expectation
of
a
customer
,
she
coolly
acceded
to
my
request
.
She
*NL*
pointed
to
a
seat
;
I
sank
into
it
.
I
felt
sorely
urged
to
weep
;
but
*NL*
conscious
how
unseasonable
such
a
manifestation
would
be
,
I
restrained
*NL*
it
.
Soon
I
asked
her
``
if
there
were
any
dressmaker
or
plain-workwoman
in
*NL*
the
village
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
two
or
three
.
Quite
as
many
as
there
was
employment
for
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
reflected
.
I
was
driven
to
the
point
now
.
I
was
brought
face
to
face
*NL*
with
Necessity
.
I
stood
in
the
position
of
one
without
a
resource
,
*NL*
without
a
friend
,
without
a
coin
.
I
must
do
something
.
What
?
I
must
*NL*
apply
somewhere
.
Where
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
she
know
of
any
place
in
the
neighbourhood
where
a
servant
was
*NL*
wanted
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
;
she
could
n't
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
was
the
chief
trade
in
this
place
?
What
did
most
of
the
people
*NL*
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
were
farm
labourers
;
a
good
deal
worked
at
Mr.
Oliver
's
*NL*
needle-factory
,
and
at
the
foundry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
Mr.
Oliver
employ
women
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
;
it
was
men
's
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
do
the
women
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knaw
n't
,
''
was
the
answer
.
``
Some
does
one
thing
,
and
some
another
.
*NL*
Poor
folk
mun
get
on
as
they
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
seemed
to
be
tired
of
my
questions
:
and
,
indeed
,
what
claim
had
I
to
*NL*
importune
her
?
A
neighbour
or
two
came
in
;
my
chair
was
evidently
*NL*
wanted
.
I
took
leave
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
passed
up
the
street
,
looking
as
I
went
at
all
the
houses
to
the
right
*NL*
hand
and
to
the
left
;
but
I
could
discover
no
pretext
,
nor
see
an
*NL*
inducement
to
enter
any
.
I
rambled
round
the
hamlet
,
going
sometimes
to
*NL*
a
little
distance
and
returning
again
,
for
an
hour
or
more
.
Much
*NL*
exhausted
,
and
suffering
greatly
now
for
want
of
food
,
I
turned
aside
*NL*
into
a
lane
and
sat
down
under
the
hedge
.
Ere
many
minutes
had
elapsed
,
*NL*
I
was
again
on
my
feet
,
however
,
and
again
searching
something
--
a
*NL*
resource
,
or
at
least
an
informant
.
A
pretty
little
house
stood
at
the
*NL*
top
of
the
lane
,
with
a
garden
before
it
,
exquisitely
neat
and
*NL*
brilliantly
blooming
.
I
stopped
at
it
.
What
business
had
I
to
approach
*NL*
the
white
door
or
touch
the
glittering
knocker
?
In
what
way
could
it
*NL*
possibly
be
the
interest
of
the
inhabitants
of
that
dwelling
to
serve
me
?
*NL*
Yet
I
drew
near
and
knocked
.
A
mild-looking
,
cleanly-attired
young
woman
*NL*
opened
the
door
.
In
such
a
voice
as
might
be
expected
from
a
hopeless
*NL*
heart
and
fainting
frame
--
a
voice
wretchedly
low
and
faltering
--
I
asked
*NL*
if
a
servant
was
wanted
here
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
she
;
``
we
do
not
keep
a
servant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
tell
me
where
I
could
get
employment
of
any
kind
?
''
I
continued
.
*NL*
``
I
am
a
stranger
,
without
acquaintance
in
this
place
.
I
want
some
work
:
*NL*
no
matter
what
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
not
her
business
to
think
for
me
,
or
to
seek
a
place
for
me
:
*NL*
besides
,
in
her
eyes
,
how
doubtful
must
have
appeared
my
character
,
*NL*
position
,
tale
.
She
shook
her
head
,
she
``
was
sorry
she
could
give
me
no
*NL*
information
,
''
and
the
white
door
closed
,
quite
gently
and
civilly
:
but
it
*NL*
shut
me
out
.
If
she
had
held
it
open
a
little
longer
,
I
believe
I
should
*NL*
have
begged
a
piece
of
bread
;
for
I
was
now
brought
low
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
bear
to
return
to
the
sordid
village
,
where
,
besides
,
no
*NL*
prospect
of
aid
was
visible
.
I
should
have
longed
rather
to
deviate
to
a
*NL*
wood
I
saw
not
far
off
,
which
appeared
in
its
thick
shade
to
offer
*NL*
inviting
shelter
;
but
I
was
so
sick
,
so
weak
,
so
gnawed
with
nature
's
*NL*
cravings
,
instinct
kept
me
roaming
round
abodes
where
there
was
a
chance
*NL*
of
food
.
Solitude
would
be
no
solitude
--
rest
no
rest
--
while
the
vulture
,
*NL*
hunger
,
thus
sank
beak
and
talons
in
my
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
drew
near
houses
;
I
left
them
,
and
came
back
again
,
and
again
I
*NL*
wandered
away
:
always
repelled
by
the
consciousness
of
having
no
claim
to
*NL*
ask
--
no
right
to
expect
interest
in
my
isolated
lot
.
Meantime
,
the
*NL*
afternoon
advanced
,
while
I
thus
wandered
about
like
a
lost
and
starving
*NL*
dog
.
In
crossing
a
field
,
I
saw
the
church
spire
before
me
:
I
hastened
*NL*
towards
it
.
Near
the
churchyard
,
and
in
the
middle
of
a
garden
,
stood
a
*NL*
well-built
though
small
house
,
which
I
had
no
doubt
was
the
parsonage
.
I
*NL*
remembered
that
strangers
who
arrive
at
a
place
where
they
have
no
*NL*
friends
,
and
who
want
employment
,
sometimes
apply
to
the
clergyman
for
*NL*
introduction
and
aid
.
It
is
the
clergyman
's
function
to
help
--
at
least
*NL*
with
advice
--
those
who
wished
to
help
themselves
.
I
seemed
to
have
*NL*
something
like
a
right
to
seek
counsel
here
.
Renewing
then
my
courage
,
*NL*
and
gathering
my
feeble
remains
of
strength
,
I
pushed
on
.
I
reached
the
*NL*
house
,
and
knocked
at
the
kitchen-door
.
An
old
woman
opened
:
I
asked
was
*NL*
this
the
parsonage
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
the
clergyman
in
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
he
be
in
soon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
he
was
gone
from
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
a
distance
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
so
far
--
happen
three
mile
.
He
had
been
called
away
by
the
sudden
*NL*
death
of
his
father
:
he
was
at
Marsh
End
now
,
and
would
very
likely
stay
*NL*
there
a
fortnight
longer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
there
any
lady
of
the
house
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
there
was
naught
but
her
,
and
she
was
housekeeper
;
''
and
of
her
,
*NL*
reader
,
I
could
not
bear
to
ask
the
relief
for
want
of
which
I
was
*NL*
sinking
;
I
could
not
yet
beg
;
and
again
I
crawled
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
more
I
took
off
my
handkerchief
--
once
more
I
thought
of
the
cakes
of
*NL*
bread
in
the
little
shop
.
Oh
,
for
but
a
crust
!
for
but
one
mouthful
to
*NL*
allay
the
pang
of
famine
!
Instinctively
I
turned
my
face
again
to
the
*NL*
village
;
I
found
the
shop
again
,
and
I
went
in
;
and
though
others
were
*NL*
there
besides
the
woman
I
ventured
the
request
--
``
Would
she
give
me
a
roll
*NL*
for
this
handkerchief
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
me
with
evident
suspicion
:
``
Nay
,
she
never
sold
stuff
i
'
*NL*
that
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Almost
desperate
,
I
asked
for
half
a
cake
;
she
again
refused
.
``
How
could
*NL*
she
tell
where
I
had
got
the
handkerchief
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
she
take
my
gloves
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
what
could
she
do
with
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Reader
,
it
is
not
pleasant
to
dwell
on
these
details
.
Some
say
there
is
*NL*
enjoyment
in
looking
back
to
painful
experience
past
;
but
at
this
day
I
*NL*
can
scarcely
bear
to
review
the
times
to
which
I
allude
:
the
moral
*NL*
degradation
,
blent
with
the
physical
suffering
,
form
too
distressing
a
*NL*
recollection
ever
to
be
willingly
dwelt
on
.
I
blamed
none
of
those
who
*NL*
repulsed
me
.
I
felt
it
was
what
was
to
be
expected
,
and
what
could
not
*NL*
be
helped
:
an
ordinary
beggar
is
frequently
an
object
of
suspicion
;
a
*NL*
well-dressed
beggar
inevitably
so
.
To
be
sure
,
what
I
begged
was
*NL*
employment
;
but
whose
business
was
it
to
provide
me
with
employment
?
Not
,
*NL*
certainly
,
that
of
persons
who
saw
me
then
for
the
first
time
,
and
who
*NL*
knew
nothing
about
my
character
.
And
as
to
the
woman
who
would
not
take
*NL*
my
handkerchief
in
exchange
for
her
bread
,
why
,
she
was
right
,
if
the
*NL*
offer
appeared
to
her
sinister
or
the
exchange
unprofitable
.
Let
me
*NL*
condense
now
.
I
am
sick
of
the
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
little
before
dark
I
passed
a
farm-house
,
at
the
open
door
of
which
the
*NL*
farmer
was
sitting
,
eating
his
supper
of
bread
and
cheese
.
I
stopped
and
*NL*
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
give
me
a
piece
of
bread
?
for
I
am
very
hungry
.
''
He
cast
on
me
*NL*
a
glance
of
surprise
;
but
without
answering
,
he
cut
a
thick
slice
from
*NL*
his
loaf
,
and
gave
it
to
me
.
I
imagine
he
did
not
think
I
was
a
beggar
,
*NL*
but
only
an
eccentric
sort
of
lady
,
who
had
taken
a
fancy
to
his
brown
*NL*
loaf
.
As
soon
as
I
was
out
of
sight
of
his
house
,
I
sat
down
and
ate
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
hope
to
get
a
lodging
under
a
roof
,
and
sought
it
in
the
wood
*NL*
I
have
before
alluded
to
.
But
my
night
was
wretched
,
my
rest
broken
:
the
*NL*
ground
was
damp
,
the
air
cold
:
besides
,
intruders
passed
near
me
more
*NL*
than
once
,
and
I
had
again
and
again
to
change
my
quarters
;
no
sense
of
*NL*
safety
or
tranquillity
befriended
me
.
Towards
morning
it
rained
;
the
*NL*
whole
of
the
following
day
was
wet
.
Do
not
ask
me
,
reader
,
to
give
a
*NL*
minute
account
of
that
day
;
as
before
,
I
sought
work
;
as
before
,
I
was
*NL*
repulsed
;
as
before
,
I
starved
;
but
once
did
food
pass
my
lips
.
At
the
*NL*
door
of
a
cottage
I
saw
a
little
girl
about
to
throw
a
mess
of
cold
*NL*
porridge
into
a
pig
trough
.
``
Will
you
give
me
that
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LCB-
``
Will
you
give
me
that
?
''
I
asked
:

*NL*
She
stared
at
me
.
``
Mother
!
''
she
exclaimed
,
``
there
is
a
woman
wants
me
to
*NL*
give
her
these
porridge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
lass
,
''
replied
a
voice
within

it
her

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
emptied
the
stiffened
mould
into
my
hand
,
and
I
devoured
it
*NL*
ravenously
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
wet
twilight
deepened
,
I
stopped
in
a
solitary
bridle-path
,
which
*NL*
I
had
been
pursuing
an
hour
or
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
strength
is
quite
failing
me
,
''
I
said
in
a
soliloquy
.
``
I
feel
I
*NL*
can
not
go
much
farther
.
Shall
I
be
an
outcast
again
this
night
?
While
*NL*
the
rain
descends
so
,
must
I
lay
my
head
on
the
cold
,
drenched
ground
?
I
*NL*
fear
I
can
not
do
otherwise
:
for
who
will
receive
me
?
But
it
will
be
very
*NL*
dreadful
,
with
this
feeling
of
hunger
,
faintness
,
chill
,
and
this
sense
*NL*
of
desolation
--
this
total
prostration
of
hope
.
In
all
likelihood
,
*NL*
though
,
I
should
die
before
morning
.
And
why
can
not
I
reconcile
myself
*NL*
to
the
prospect
of
death
?
Why
do
I
struggle
to
retain
a
valueless
life
?
*NL*
Because
I
know
,
or
believe
,
Mr.
Rochester
is
living
:
and
then
,
to
die
of
*NL*
want
and
cold
is
a
fate
to
which
nature
can
not
submit
passively
.
Oh
,
*NL*
Providence
!
sustain
me
a
little
longer
!
Aid
!
--
direct
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
glazed
eye
wandered
over
the
dim
and
misty
landscape
.
I
saw
I
had
*NL*
strayed
far
from
the
village
:
it
was
quite
out
of
sight
.
The
very
*NL*
cultivation
surrounding
it
had
disappeared
.
I
had
,
by
cross-ways
and
by
-
*NL*
paths
,
once
more
drawn
near
the
tract
of
moorland
;
and
now
,
only
a
few
*NL*
fields
,
almost
as
wild
and
unproductive
as
the
heath
from
which
they
were
*NL*
scarcely
reclaimed
,
lay
between
me
and
the
dusky
hill
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
would
rather
die
yonder
than
in
a
street
or
on
a
frequented
*NL*
road
,
''
I
reflected
.
``
And
far
better
that
crows
and
ravens
--
if
any
ravens
*NL*
there
be
in
these
regions
--
should
pick
my
flesh
from
my
bones
,
than
that
*NL*
they
should
be
prisoned
in
a
workhouse
coffin
and
moulder
in
a
pauper
's
*NL*
grave
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
the
hill
,
then
,
I
turned
.
I
reached
it
.
It
remained
now
only
to
find
*NL*
a
hollow
where
I
could
lie
down
,
and
feel
at
least
hidden
,
if
not
secure
.
*NL*
But
all
the
surface
of
the
waste
looked
level
.
It
showed
no
variation
*NL*
but
of
tint
:
green
,
where
rush
and
moss
overgrew
the
marshes
;
black
,
*NL*
where
the
dry
soil
bore
only
heath
.
Dark
as
it
was
getting
,
I
could
*NL*
still
see
these
changes
,
though
but
as
mere
alternations
of
light
and
*NL*
shade
;
for
colour
had
faded
with
the
daylight
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
eye
still
roved
over
the
sullen
swell
and
along
the
moor-edge
,
*NL*
vanishing
amidst
the
wildest
scenery
,
when
at
one
dim
point
,
far
in
among
*NL*
the
marshes
and
the
ridges
,
a
light
sprang
up
.
``
That
is
an
_
ignis
*NL*
fatuus
_
,
''
was
my
first
thought
;
and
I
expected
it
would
soon
vanish
.
It
*NL*
burnt
on
,
however
,
quite
steadily
,
neither
receding
nor
advancing
.
``
Is
*NL*
it
,
then
,
a
bonfire
just
kindled
?
''
I
questioned
.
I
watched
to
see
*NL*
whether
it
would
spread
:
but
no
;
as
it
did
not
diminish
,
so
it
did
not
*NL*
enlarge
.
``
It
may
be
a
candle
in
a
house
,
''
I
then
conjectured
;
``
but
if
*NL*
so
,
I
can
never
reach
it
.
It
is
much
too
far
away
:
and
were
it
within
a
*NL*
yard
of
me
,
what
would
it
avail
?
I
should
but
knock
at
the
door
to
have
*NL*
it
shut
in
my
face
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
I
sank
down
where
I
stood
,
and
hid
my
face
against
the
ground
.
I
lay
*NL*
still
a
while
:
the
night-wind
swept
over
the
hill
and
over
me
,
and
died
*NL*
moaning
in
the
distance
;
the
rain
fell
fast
,
wetting
me
afresh
to
the
*NL*
skin
.
Could
I
but
have
stiffened
to
the
still
frost
--
the
friendly
*NL*
numbness
of
death
--
it
might
have
pelted
on
;
I
should
not
have
felt
it
;
*NL*
but
my
yet
living
flesh
shuddered
at
its
chilling
influence
.
I
rose
ere
*NL*
long
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
light
was
yet
there
,
shining
dim
but
constant
through
the
rain
.
I
*NL*
tried
to
walk
again
:
I
dragged
my
exhausted
limbs
slowly
towards
it
.
It
*NL*
led
me
aslant
over
the
hill
,
through
a
wide
bog
,
which
would
have
been
*NL*
impassable
in
winter
,
and
was
splashy
and
shaking
even
now
,
in
the
height
*NL*
of
summer
.
Here
I
fell
twice
;
but
as
often
I
rose
and
rallied
my
*NL*
faculties
.
This
light
was
my
forlorn
hope
:
I
must
gain
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
crossed
the
marsh
,
I
saw
a
trace
of
white
over
the
moor
.
I
*NL*
approached
it
;
it
was
a
road
or
a
track
:
it
led
straight
up
to
the
light
,
*NL*
which
now
beamed
from
a
sort
of
knoll
,
amidst
a
clump
of
trees
--
firs
,
*NL*
apparently
,
from
what
I
could
distinguish
of
the
character
of
their
forms
*NL*
and
foliage
through
the
gloom
.
My
star
vanished
as
I
drew
near
:
some
*NL*
obstacle
had
intervened
between
me
and
it
.
I
put
out
my
hand
to
feel
the
*NL*
dark
mass
before
me
:
I
discriminated
the
rough
stones
of
a
low
wall
--
above
*NL*
it
,
something
like
palisades
,
and
within
,
a
high
and
prickly
hedge
.
I
*NL*
groped
on
.
Again
a
whitish
object
gleamed
before
me
:
it
was
a
gate
--
a
*NL*
wicket
;
it
moved
on
its
hinges
as
I
touched
it
.
On
each
side
stood
a
*NL*
sable
bush-holly
or
yew
.
*NL*
*NL*
Entering
the
gate
and
passing
the
shrubs
,
the
silhouette
of
a
house
rose
*NL*
to
view
,
black
,
low
,
and
rather
long
;
but
the
guiding
light
shone
*NL*
nowhere
.
All
was
obscurity
.
Were
the
inmates
retired
to
rest
?
I
feared
*NL*
it
must
be
so
.
In
seeking
the
door
,
I
turned
an
angle
:
there
shot
out
*NL*
the
friendly
gleam
again
,
from
the
lozenged
panes
of
a
very
small
*NL*
latticed
window
,
within
a
foot
of
the
ground
,
made
still
smaller
by
the
*NL*
growth
of
ivy
or
some
other
creeping
plant
,
whose
leaves
clustered
thick
*NL*
over
the
portion
of
the
house
wall
in
which
it
was
set
.
The
aperture
was
*NL*
so
screened
and
narrow
,
that
curtain
or
shutter
had
been
deemed
*NL*
unnecessary
;
and
when
I
stooped
down
and
put
aside
the
spray
of
foliage
*NL*
shooting
over
it
,
I
could
see
all
within
.
I
could
see
clearly
a
room
*NL*
with
a
sanded
floor
,
clean
scoured
;
a
dresser
of
walnut
,
with
pewter
*NL*
plates
ranged
in
rows
,
reflecting
the
redness
and
radiance
of
a
glowing
*NL*
peat-fire
.
I
could
see
a
clock
,
a
white
deal
table
,
some
chairs
.
The
*NL*
candle
,
whose
ray
had
been
my
beacon
,
burnt
on
the
table
;
and
by
its
*NL*
light
an
elderly
woman
,
somewhat
rough-looking
,
but
scrupulously
clean
,
*NL*
like
all
about
her
,
was
knitting
a
stocking
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
noticed
these
objects
cursorily
only
--
in
them
there
was
nothing
*NL*
extraordinary
.
A
group
of
more
interest
appeared
near
the
hearth
,
*NL*
sitting
still
amidst
the
rosy
peace
and
warmth
suffusing
it
.
Two
young
,
*NL*
graceful
women
--
ladies
in
every
point
--
sat
,
one
in
a
low
rocking-chair
,
*NL*
the
other
on
a
lower
stool
;
both
wore
deep
mourning
of
crape
and
*NL*
bombazeen
,
which
sombre
garb
singularly
set
off
very
fair
necks
and
*NL*
faces
:
a
large
old
pointer
dog
rested
its
massive
head
on
the
knee
of
one
*NL*
girl
--
in
the
lap
of
the
other
was
cushioned
a
black
cat
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
strange
place
was
this
humble
kitchen
for
such
occupants
!
Who
were
*NL*
they
?
They
could
not
be
the
daughters
of
the
elderly
person
at
the
*NL*
table
;
for
she
looked
like
a
rustic
,
and
they
were
all
delicacy
and
*NL*
cultivation
.
I
had
nowhere
seen
such
faces
as
theirs
:
and
yet
,
as
I
*NL*
gazed
on
them
,
I
seemed
intimate
with
every
lineament
.
I
can
not
call
*NL*
them
handsome
--
they
were
too
pale
and
grave
for
the
word
:
as
they
each
*NL*
bent
over
a
book
,
they
looked
thoughtful
almost
to
severity
.
A
stand
*NL*
between
them
supported
a
second
candle
and
two
great
volumes
,
to
which
*NL*
they
frequently
referred
,
comparing
them
,
seemingly
,
with
the
smaller
*NL*
books
they
held
in
their
hands
,
like
people
consulting
a
dictionary
to
*NL*
aid
them
in
the
task
of
translation
.
This
scene
was
as
silent
as
if
all
*NL*
the
figures
had
been
shadows
and
the
firelit
apartment
a
picture
:
so
*NL*
hushed
was
it
,
I
could
hear
the
cinders
fall
from
the
grate
,
the
clock
*NL*
tick
in
its
obscure
corner
;
and
I
even
fancied
I
could
distinguish
the
*NL*
click-click
of
the
woman
's
knitting-needles
.
When
,
therefore
,
a
voice
*NL*
broke
the
strange
stillness
at
last
,
it
was
audible
enough
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
Diana
,
''
said
one
of
the
absorbed
students
;
``
Franz
and
old
Daniel
*NL*
are
together
in
the
night-time
,
and
Franz
is
telling
a
dream
from
which
*NL*
he
has
awakened
in
terror
--
listen
!
''
And
in
a
low
voice
she
read
*NL*
something
,
of
which
not
one
word
was
intelligible
to
me
;
for
it
was
in
an
*NL*
unknown
tongue
--
neither
French
nor
Latin
.
Whether
it
were
Greek
or
*NL*
German
I
could
not
tell
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
strong
,
''
she
said
,
when
she
had
finished
:
``
I
relish
it
.
''
The
*NL*
other
girl
,
who
had
lifted
her
head
to
listen
to
her
sister
,
repeated
,
*NL*
while
she
gazed
at
the
fire
,
a
line
of
what
had
been
read
.
At
a
later
*NL*
day
,
I
knew
the
language
and
the
book
;
therefore
,
I
will
here
quote
the
*NL*
line
:
though
,
when
I
first
heard
it
,
it
was
only
like
a
stroke
on
*NL*
sounding
brass
to
me
--
conveying
no
meaning
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Da
trat
hervor
Einer
,
anzusehen
wie
die
Sternen
Nacht
.
'
Good
!
good
!
''
*NL*
she
exclaimed
,
while
her
dark
and
deep
eye
sparkled
.
``
There
you
have
a
*NL*
dim
and
mighty
archangel
fitly
set
before
you
!
The
line
is
worth
a
*NL*
hundred
pages
of
fustian
.
`
Ich
wage
die
Gedanken
in
der
Schale
meines
*NL*
Zornes
und

Werke

dem
Gewichte

Grimms

'
I
like
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Both
were
again
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
ony
country
where
they
talk
i
'
that
way
?
''
asked
the
old
woman
,
*NL*
looking
up
from
her
knitting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

Hannah
--
a
far
larger
country
than
England

where

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
We
could
probably
tell

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
``

done

Mary

''
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
``
Surely

looking
at

she
drew
from

It

fast

Hannah
:
will
you
have
*NL*
the
goodness
to
look
at

fire
in

parlour

*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
rose
:
she
opened
a
door
,
through
which
I
dimly
saw
a
passage
:
*NL*
soon
I
heard
her
stir
a
fire
in
an
inner
room
;
she
presently
came
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
childer
!

said
she
,
``
it
fair
troubles

*NL*
*NL*
She
wiped
her
eyes
with
her
apron
:
the
two
girls
,
grave
before
,
looked
*NL*
sad
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
he
is
in
a

continued
Hannah
:
``
we
should
n't

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

never

inquired
one
of
the
ladies

*NL*

Mr.
St.
John
asked
if
he
would
like
either
o
'
ye
to
be
sent
for
,
he
fair
*NL*
laughed
at
him
.
He
began
again
with
a
bit
of
a
heaviness
in
his
head
the
*NL*
next
day
--
that
is
,
a
fortnight
sin
'
--
and
he
went
to
sleep
and
niver
*NL*
wakened
:
he
wor
a
`
most
stark
when
your
brother
went
into
t
'
chamber
and
*NL*
fand
him
.
Ah
,
childer
!
that
's
t
'
last
o
'
t
'
old
stock
--
for
ye
and
Mr.
*NL*
St.
John
is
like
of
different
soart
to
them
`
at
's
gone
;
for
all
your
*NL*
mother
wor
mich
i
'
your
way
,
and
a
`
most
as
book-learned
.
She
wor
the
*NL*
pictur
'
o
'
ye
,
Mary
:
Diana
is
more
like
your
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
them
so
similar
I
could
not
tell
where
the
old
servant
-LRB-
for
*NL*
such
I
now
concluded
her
to
be
-RRB-
saw
the
difference
.
Both
were
fair
*NL*
complexioned
and
slenderly
made
;
both
possessed
faces
full
of
distinction
*NL*
and
intelligence
.
One
,
to
be
sure
,
had
hair
a
shade
darker
than
the
*NL*
other
,
and
there
was
a
difference
in
their
style
of
wearing
it
;
Mary
's
*NL*
pale
brown
locks
were
parted
and
braided
smooth
:
Diana
's
duskier
tresses
*NL*
covered
her
neck
with
thick
curls
.
The
clock
struck
ten
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye
'll
want
your
supper
,
I
am
sure
,
''
observed
Hannah
;
``
and
so
will
Mr.
*NL*
St.
John
when
he
comes
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
proceeded
to
prepare
the
meal
.
The
ladies
rose
;
they
seemed
*NL*
about
to
withdraw
to
the
parlour
.
Till
this
moment
,
I
had
been
so
intent
*NL*
on
watching
them
,
their
appearance
and
conversation
had
excited
in
me
so
*NL*
keen
an
interest
,
I
had
half-forgotten
my
own
wretched
position
:
now
it
*NL*
recurred
to
me
.
More
desolate
,
more
desperate
than
ever
,
it
seemed
from
*NL*
contrast
.
And
how
impossible
did
it
appear
to
touch
the
inmates
of
this
*NL*
house
with
concern
on
my
behalf
;
to
make
them
believe
in
the
truth
of
my
*NL*
wants
and
woes
--
to
induce
them
to
vouchsafe
a
rest
for
my
wanderings
!
As
*NL*
I
groped
out
the
door
,
and
knocked
at
it
hesitatingly
,
I
felt
that
last
*NL*
idea
to
be
a
mere
chimera
.
Hannah
opened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
?
''
she
inquired
,
in
a
voice
of
surprise
,
as
she
surveyed
*NL*
me
by
the
light
of
the
candle
she
held
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
speak
to
your
mistresses
?
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
better
tell
me
what
you
have
to
say
to
them
.
Where
do
you
come
*NL*
from
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
a
stranger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
your
business
here
at
this
hour
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
a
night
's
shelter
in
an
out-house
or
anywhere
,
and
a
morsel
of
*NL*
bread
to
eat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Distrust
,
the
very
feeling
I
dreaded
,
appeared
in
Hannah
's
face
.
``
I
'll
*NL*
give
you
a
piece
of
bread
,
''
she
said
,
after
a
pause
;
``
but
we
ca
n't
take
*NL*
in
a
vagrant
to
lodge
.
It
is
n't
likely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
let
me
speak
to
your
mistresses

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
not
I
.
What
can
they
do
for
you
?
You
should
not
be
roving
about
*NL*
now
;
it
looks
very
ill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
where
shall
I
go
if
you
drive
me
away
?
What
shall
I
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'll
warrant
you
know
where
to
go
and
what
to
do
.
Mind
you
do
n't
do
*NL*
wrong
,
that
's
all
.
Here
is
a
penny
;
now
go
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
penny
can
not
feed
me
,
and
I
have
no
strength
to
go
farther
.
Do
n't
*NL*
shut
the
door
:
--
oh
,
do
n't
,
for
God
's
sake
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
;
the
rain
is
driving
in
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
the
young
ladies
.
Let
me
see
them

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
I
will
not
.
You
are
not
what
you
ought
to
be

you

make
such
a
noise

Move
off

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
must
die
if
I
am
turned
away

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

you
about

houses
at
this
time
o

night

If

any

such
like
--
anywhere
near
,
you
may
tell
them
*NL*
we
are
not
by
ourselves
in
the
house
;
we
have
a
gentleman
,
and
dogs
,
and
*NL*
guns
.
''
Here
the
honest
but
inflexible
servant
clapped
the
door
to
and
*NL*
bolted
it
within
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
climax
.
A
pang
of
exquisite
suffering
--
a
throe
of
true
*NL*
despair
--
rent
and
heaved
my
heart
.
Worn
out
,
indeed
,
I
was
;
not
another
*NL*
step
could
I
stir
.
I
sank
on
the
wet
doorstep
:
I
groaned
--
I
wrung
my
*NL*
hands
--
I
wept
in
utter
anguish
.
Oh
,
this
spectre
of
death
!
Oh
,
this
*NL*
last
hour
,
approaching
in
such
horror
!
Alas
,
this
isolation
--
this
*NL*
banishment
from
my
kind
!
Not
only
the
anchor
of
hope
,
but
the
footing
of
*NL*
fortitude
was
gone
--
at
least
for
a
moment
;
but
the
last
I
soon
*NL*
endeavoured
to
regain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
but
die
,
''
I
said
,
``
and
I
believe
in
God
.
Let
me
try
to
wait
His
*NL*
will
in
silence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
words
I
not
only
thought
,
but
uttered
;
and
thrusting
back
all
my
*NL*
misery
into
my
heart
,
I
made
an
effort
to
compel
it
to
remain
there
--
dumb
*NL*
and
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
men
must
die
,
''
said
a
voice
quite
close
at
hand
;
``
but
all
are
not
*NL*
condemned
to
meet
a
lingering
and
premature
doom
,
such
as
yours
would
be
*NL*
if
you
perished
here
of
want
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
or
what
speaks
?
''
I
asked
,
terrified
at
the
unexpected
sound
,
and
*NL*
incapable
now
of
deriving
from
any
occurrence
a
hope
of
aid
.
A
form
was
*NL*
near
--
what
form
,
the
pitch-dark
night
and
my
enfeebled
vision
prevented
*NL*
me
from
distinguishing
.
With
a
loud
long
knock
,
the
new-comer
appealed
*NL*
to
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
you
,
Mr.
St.
John
?
''
cried
Hannah
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

yes
;
open
quickly

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

in

your
sisters
are
quite
uneasy
about
you

I
believe
there
are
bad
*NL*
folks
about

There
has
been
a
beggar-woman

I
declare
she
is
not
gone

laid
down
there

*NL*
``
Hush

let
me
do
mine
in
admitting
her

I
was
near

and
*NL*
listened
to
both
you
and
her

I
think
this
is
a
peculiar
case

I
must
at

examine
into

-LCB-
Hush
,
Hannah
;
I
have
a
word
to
say
to
the
woman
:
p323.jpg
-RCB-
*NL*
*NL*
With
difficulty
I
obeyed
him
.
Presently
I
stood
within
that
clean
,
*NL*
bright
kitchen
--
on
the
very
hearth
--
trembling
,
sickening
;
conscious
of
an
*NL*
aspect
in
the
last
degree
ghastly
,
wild
,
and
weather-beaten
.
The
two
*NL*
ladies
,
their
brother
,
Mr.
St.
John
,
the
old
servant
,
were
all
gazing
at
*NL*
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
St.
John
,
who
is
it
?
''
I
heard
one
ask
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
tell
:
I
found
her
at
the
door
,
''
was
the
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
does
look
white
,
''
said
Hannah
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
white
as
clay
or
death

''
was
responded
.
``
She
will
fall
:
let
her
*NL*
sit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
indeed
my
head
swam
:
I
dropped
,
but
a
chair
received
me
.
I
still
*NL*
possessed
my
senses
,
though
just
now
I
could
not
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
a
little
water
would
restore
her

Hannah
,
fetch
some
.
But
she
*NL*
is
worn
to
nothing

How
very
thin
,
and
how
very
bloodless
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
mere
spectre
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
she
ill
,
or
only
famished
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Famished

I
think

Hannah
,
is
that
milk
?
Give
it
me
,
and
a
piece
of

bread

''
*NL*
*NL*
Diana
-LRB-
I
knew
her
by
the
long
curls
which
I
saw
drooping
between
me
and
*NL*
the
fire
as
she
bent
over
me
-RRB-
broke
some
bread
,
dipped
it
in
milk
,
and
*NL*
put
it
to
my
lips
.
Her
face
was
near
mine
:
I
saw
there
was
pity
in
it
,
*NL*
and
I
felt
sympathy
in
her
hurried
breathing
.
In
her
simple
words
,
too
,
*NL*
the
same
balm-like
emotion
spoke
:
``
Try
to
eat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
try
,
''
repeated
Mary
gently
;
and
Mary
's
hand
removed
my
sodden
*NL*
bonnet
and
lifted
my
head
.
I
tasted
what
they
offered
me
:
feebly
at
*NL*
first
,
eagerly
soon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
too
much
at
first
--
restrain
her
,
''
said
the
brother
;
``
she
has
had
*NL*
enough
.
''
And
he
withdrew
the
cup
of
milk
and
the
plate
of
bread
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
little
more
,
St.
John
--
look
at
the
avidity
in
her
eyes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
more
at
present

Try
if
she
can
speak
now

ask
her
her
*NL*
name

*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
I
could
speak
,
and
I
answered
--
``
My
name
is
Jane
Elliott
.
''
Anxious
*NL*
as
ever
to
avoid
discovery
,
I
had
before
resolved
to
assume
an
_
alias
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
where
do
you
live
?
Where
are
your
friends
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
we
send
for
any
one
you
know
?

*NL*
*NL*
I
shook
my
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
account
can
you
give
of
yourself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Somehow
,
now
that
I
had
once
crossed
the
threshold
of
this
house
,
and
*NL*
once
was
brought
face
to
face
with
its
owners
,
I
felt
no
longer
outcast
,
*NL*
vagrant
,
and
disowned
by
the
wide
world
.
I
dared
to
put
off
the
*NL*
mendicant
--
to
resume
my
natural
manner
and
character
.
I
began
once
more
*NL*
to
know
myself
;
and
when
Mr.
St.
John
demanded
an
account
--
which
at
*NL*
present
I
was
far
too
weak
to
render
--
I
said
after
a
brief
pause
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
I
can
give
you
no
details
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
,
then
,
''
said
he
,
``
do
you
expect
me
to
do
for
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
''
I
replied
.
My
strength
sufficed
for
but
short
answers
.
Diana
*NL*
took
the
word
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
,
''
she
asked
,
``
that
we
have
now
given
you
what
aid
you
*NL*
require
?
and
that
we
may
dismiss
you
to
the
moor
and
the
rainy
night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
looked
at
her
.
She
had
,
I
thought
,
a
remarkable
countenance
,
instinct
*NL*
both
with
power
and
goodness
.
I
took
sudden
courage
.
Answering
her
*NL*
compassionate
gaze
with
a
smile
,
I
said
--
``
I
will
trust
you
.
If
I
were
a
*NL*
masterless
and
stray
dog
,
I
know
that
you
would
not
turn
me
from
your
*NL*
hearth
to-night
:
as
it
is
,
I
really
have
no
fear
.
Do
with
me
and
for
me
*NL*
as
you
like
;
but
excuse
me
from
much
discourse
--
my
breath
is
short
--
I
*NL*
feel
a
spasm
when
I
speak
.
''
All
three
surveyed
me
,
and
all
three
were
*NL*
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hannah
,
''
said
Mr.
St.
John
,
at
last
,
``
let
her
sit
there
at
present
,
and
*NL*
ask
her
no
questions
;
in
ten
minutes
more
,
give
her
the
remainder
of
that
*NL*
milk
and
bread
.
Mary
and
Diana
,
let
us
go
into
the
parlour
and
talk
the
*NL*
matter
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
withdrew
.
Very
soon
one
of
the
ladies
returned
--
I
could
not
tell
*NL*
which
.
A
kind
of
pleasant
stupor
was
stealing
over
me
as
I
sat
by
the
*NL*
genial
fire
.
In
an
undertone
she
gave
some
directions
to
Hannah
.
Ere
*NL*
long
,
with
the
servant
's
aid
,
I
contrived
to
mount
a
staircase
;
my
*NL*
dripping
clothes
were
removed
;
soon
a
warm
,
dry
bed
received
me
.
I
*NL*
thanked
God
--
experienced
amidst
unutterable
exhaustion
a
glow
of
grateful
*NL*
joy
--
and
slept

CHAPTER
XXIX
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
recollection
of
about
three
days
and
nights
succeeding
this
is
very
*NL*
dim
in
my
mind
.
I
can
recall
some
sensations
felt
in
that
interval
;
but
*NL*
few
thoughts
framed
,
and
no
actions
performed
.
I
knew
I
was
in
a
small
*NL*
room
and
in
a
narrow
bed
.
To
that
bed
I
seemed
to
have
grown
;
I
lay
on
*NL*
it
motionless
as
a
stone
;
and
to
have
torn
me
from
it
would
have
been
*NL*
almost
to
kill
me
.
I
took
no
note
of
the
lapse
of
time
--
of
the
change
*NL*
from
morning
to
noon
,
from
noon
to
evening
.
I
observed
when
any
one
*NL*
entered
or
left
the
apartment
:
I
could
even
tell
who
they
were
;
I
could
*NL*
understand
what
was
said
when
the
speaker
stood
near
to
me
;
but
I
could
*NL*
not
answer
;
to
open
my
lips
or
move
my
limbs
was
equally
impossible
.
*NL*
Hannah
,
the
servant
,
was
my
most
frequent
visitor
.
Her
coming
disturbed
*NL*
me
.
I
had
a
feeling
that
she
wished
me
away
:
that
she
did
not
understand
*NL*
me
or
my
circumstances
;
that
she
was
prejudiced
against
me
.
Diana
and
*NL*
Mary
appeared
in
the
chamber
once
or
twice
a
day
.
They
would
whisper
*NL*
sentences
of
this
sort
at
my
bedside
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
very
well
we
took
her
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
she
would
certainly
have
been
found
dead
at
the
door
in
the
morning
*NL*
had
she
been
left
out
all
night
.
I
wonder
what
she
has
gone
through
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Strange
hardships
,
I
imagine
--
poor
,
emaciated
,
pallid
wanderer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
not
an
uneducated
person
,
I
should
think
,
by
her
manner
of
*NL*
speaking
;
her
accent
was
quite
pure
;
and
the
clothes
she
took
off
,
though
*NL*
splashed
and
wet
,
were
little
worn
and
fine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
a
peculiar
face
;
fleshless
and
haggard
as
it
is
,
I
rather
like
*NL*
it
;
and
when
in
good
health
and
animated
,
I
can
fancy
her
physiognomy
*NL*
would
be
agreeable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Never
once
in
their
dialogues
did
I
hear
a
syllable
of
regret
at
the
*NL*
hospitality
they
had
extended
to
me
,
or
of
suspicion
of
,
or
aversion
to
,
*NL*
myself
.
I
was
comforted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
St.
John
came
but
once
:
he
looked
at
me
,
and
said
my
state
of
*NL*
lethargy
was
the
result
of
reaction
from
excessive
and
protracted
*NL*
fatigue
.
He
pronounced
it
needless
to
send
for
a
doctor
:
nature
,
he
was
*NL*
sure
,
would
manage
best
,
left
to
herself
.
He
said
every
nerve
had
been
*NL*
overstrained
in
some
way
,
and
the
whole
system
must
sleep
torpid
a
while
.
*NL*
There
was
no
disease
.
He
imagined
my
recovery
would
be
rapid
enough
when
*NL*
once
commenced
.
These
opinions
he
delivered
in
a
few
words
,
in
a
quiet
,
*NL*
low
voice
;
and
added
,
after
a
pause
,
in
the
tone
of
a
man
little
*NL*
accustomed
to
expansive
comment
,
``
Rather
an
unusual
physiognomy
;
*NL*
certainly
,
not
indicative
of
vulgarity
or
degradation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Far
otherwise
,
''
responded
Diana
.
``
To
speak
truth
,
St.
John
,
my
heart
*NL*
rather
warms
to
the
poor
little
soul
.
I
wish
we
may
be
able
to
benefit
*NL*
her
permanently
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
hardly
likely
,
''
was
the
reply
.
``
You
will
find
she
is
some
young
*NL*
lady
who
has
had
a
misunderstanding
with
her
friends
,
and
has
probably
*NL*
injudiciously
left
them
.
We
may
,
perhaps
,
succeed
in
restoring
her
to
*NL*
them
,
if
she
is
not
obstinate
:
but
I
trace
lines
of
force
in
her
face
*NL*
which
make
me
sceptical
of
her
tractability
.
''
He
stood
considering
me
*NL*
some
minutes
;
then
added
,
``
She
looks
sensible
,
but
not
at
all
handsome
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
so
ill
,
St.
John
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ill
or
well
,
she
would
always
be
plain
.
The
grace
and
harmony
of
beauty
*NL*
are
quite
wanting
in
those
features
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
third
day
I
was
better
;
on
the
fourth
,
I
could
speak
,
move
,
rise
*NL*
in
bed
,
and
turn
.
Hannah
had
brought
me
some
gruel
and
dry
toast
,
about
,
*NL*
as
I
supposed
,
the
dinner-hour
.
I
had
eaten
with
relish
:
the
food
was
*NL*
good
--
void
of
the
feverish
flavour
which
had
hitherto
poisoned
what
I
had
*NL*
swallowed
.
When
she
left
me
,
I
felt
comparatively
strong
and
revived
:
*NL*
ere
long
satiety
of
repose
and
desire
for
action
stirred
me
.
I
wished
to
*NL*
rise
;
but
what
could
I
put
on
?
Only
my
damp
and
bemired
apparel
;
in
*NL*
which
I
had
slept
on
the
ground
and
fallen
in
the
marsh
.
I
felt
ashamed
*NL*
to
appear
before
my
benefactors
so
clad
.
I
was
spared
the
humiliation
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
a
chair
by
the
bedside
were
all
my
own
things
,
clean
and
dry
.
My
*NL*
black
silk
frock
hung
against
the
wall
.
The
traces
of
the
bog
were
*NL*
removed
from
it
;
the
creases
left
by
the
wet
smoothed
out
:
it
was
quite
*NL*
decent
.
My
very
shoes
and
stockings
were
purified
and
rendered
*NL*
presentable
.
There
were
the
means
of
washing
in
the
room
,
and
a
comb
and
*NL*
brush
to
smooth
my
hair
.
After
a
weary
process
,
and
resting
every
five
*NL*
minutes
,
I
succeeded
in
dressing
myself
.
My
clothes
hung
loose
on
me
;
*NL*
for
I
was
much
wasted
,
but
I
covered
deficiencies
with
a
shawl
,
and
once
*NL*
more
,
clean
and
respectable
looking
--
no
speck
of
the
dirt
,
no
trace
of
*NL*
the
disorder
I
so
hated
,
and
which
seemed
so
to
degrade
me
,
left
--
I
crept
*NL*
down
a
stone
staircase
with
the
aid
of
the
banisters
,
to
a
narrow
low
*NL*
passage
,
and
found
my
way
presently
to
the
kitchen
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
full
of
the
fragrance
of
new
bread
and
the
warmth
of
a
generous
*NL*
fire
.
Hannah
was
baking
.
Prejudices
,
it
is
well
known
,
are
most
*NL*
difficult
to
eradicate
from
the
heart
whose
soil
has
never
been
loosened
*NL*
or
fertilised
by
education
:
they
grow
there
,
firm
as
weeds
among
stones
.
*NL*
Hannah
had
been
cold
and
stiff
,
indeed
,
at
the
first
:
latterly
she
had
*NL*
begun
to
relent
a
little
;
and
when
she
saw
me
come
in
tidy
and
*NL*
well-dressed
,
she
even
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
you
have
got
up
!
''
she
said
.
``
You
are
better
,
then
.
You
may
sit
*NL*
you
down
in
my
chair
on
the
hearthstone
,
if
you
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
pointed
to
the
rocking-chair
:
I
took
it
.
She
bustled
about
,
*NL*
examining
me
every
now
and
then
with
the
corner
of
her
eye
.
Turning
to
*NL*
me
,
as
she
took
some
loaves
from
the
oven
,
she
asked
bluntly
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
ever
go
a-begging
afore
you
came
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
indignant
for
a
moment
;
but
remembering
that
anger
was
out
of
the
*NL*
question
,
and
that
I
had
indeed
appeared
as
a
beggar
to
her
,
I
answered
*NL*
quietly
,
but
still
not
without
a
certain
marked
firmness
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
mistaken
in
supposing
me
a
beggar
.
I
am
no
beggar
;
any
more
*NL*
than
yourself
or
your
young
ladies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
pause
she
said
,
``
I
dunnut
understand
that
:
you
've
like
no
house
,
*NL*
nor
no
brass
,
I
guess
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
want
of
house
or
brass
-LRB-
by
which
I
suppose
you
mean
money
-RRB-
does
not
*NL*
make
a
beggar
in
your
sense
of
the
word
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
book-learned
?
''
she
inquired
presently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
very
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
've
never
been
to
a
boarding-school
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
at
a
boarding-school
eight
years
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
opened
her
eyes
wide
.
``
Whatever
can
not
ye
keep
yourself
for
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
kept
myself
;
and
,
I
trust
,
shall
keep
myself
again
.
What
are
you
*NL*
going
to
do
with
these
gooseberries
?
''
I
inquired
,
as
she
brought
out
a
*NL*
basket
of
the
fruit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mak
'
'em
into
pies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
them
to
me
and
I
'll
pick
them

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
;
I
dunnut
want
ye
to
do
nought

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
must
do
something
.
Let
me
have
them

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
consented
;
and
she
even
brought
me
a
clean
towel
to
spread
over
my
*NL*
dress
,
``
lest
,
''
as
she
said
,
``
I
should
mucky
it

*NL*
*NL*
``

she
*NL*
remarked
.
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

you
are
wrong

now

what
I
have
been

n't

*NL*
your

further
about
me
;
but
tell

name

house

*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
calls

*NL*

I
remembered
the
answer

the
old
housekeeper
at
the
parsonage

when
I

had
asked
to
see
the
clergyman

She
again
regarded

with

some
minutes

just
now
made
it
a
species
of
reproach
that

no

Some
of
the
best

She
put
her
floury
and
horny
hand
into
mine
;
another
and
heartier
smile
*NL*
illumined
her
rough
face
,
and
from
that
moment
we
were
friends

*NL*
Hannah
was
evidently
fond
of
talking

While
I
picked
the
fruit
,
and
she
*NL*
made
the
paste
for
the
pies
,
she
proceeded
to
give
me
sundry
details
*NL*
about
her
deceased
master
and
mistress
,
and
``
the
childer

''
as
she
called
*NL*
the
young
people

*NL*
*NL*
Old
Mr.
Rivers
,
she
said
,
was
a
plain
man
enough
,
but
a
gentleman
,
and
of
*NL*
as
ancient
a
family
as
could
be
found
.
Marsh
End
had
belonged
to
the
*NL*
Rivers
ever
since
it
was
a
house
:
and
it
was
,
she
affirmed
,
``
aboon
two
*NL*
hundred
year
old

for
all
it
looked

humble
place

*NL*
compare
wi

Mr.
Oliver

grand
hall
down

Morton
Vale

But
she
could
*NL*
remember
Bill
Oliver

father
a
journeyman
needlemaker

The
mistress
was
*NL*
different
.
She
was
a
great
reader
,
and
studied
a
deal
;
and
the
``
bairns
''
*NL*
had
taken
after
her
.
There
was
nothing
like
them
in
these
parts
,
nor
*NL*
ever
had
been
;
they
had
liked
learning
,
all
three
,
almost
from
the
time
*NL*
they
could
speak
;
and
they
had
always
been
``
of
a
mak
'
of
their
own
.

Mr.
*NL*
St.
John
,
when
he
grew
up
,
would
go
to
college
and
be
a
parson
;
and
the
*NL*
girls
,
as
soon
as
they
left
school
,
would
seek
places
as
governesses
:
for
*NL*
they
had
told
her
their
father
had
some
years
ago
lost
a
great
deal
of
*NL*
money
by
a
man
he
had
trusted
turning
bankrupt
;
and
as
he
was
now
not
*NL*
rich
enough
to
give
them
fortunes
,
they
must
provide
for
themselves
.
They
*NL*
had
lived
very
little
at
home
for
a
long
while
,
and
were
only
come
now
to
*NL*
stay
a
few
weeks
on
account
of
their
father
's
death
;
but
they
did
so
like
*NL*
Marsh
End
and
Morton
,
and
all
these
moors
and
hills
about
.
They
had
been
*NL*
in
London
,
and
many
other
grand
towns
;
but
they
always
said
there
was
no
*NL*
place
like
home
;
and
then
they
were
so
agreeable
with
each
other
--
never
*NL*
fell
out
nor
``
threaped
.
''
She
did
not
know
where
there
was
such
a
family
*NL*
for
being
united
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
finished
my
task
of
gooseberry
picking
,
I
asked
where
the
two
*NL*
ladies
and
their
brother
were
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gone
over
to
Morton
for
a
walk
;
but
they
would
be
back
in
half-an-hour
*NL*
to
tea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
returned
within
the
time
Hannah
had
allotted
them
:
they
entered
by
*NL*
the
kitchen
door
.
Mr.
St.
John
,
when
he
saw
me
,
merely
bowed
and
passed
*NL*
through
;
the
two
ladies
stopped
:
Mary
,
in
a
few
words
,
kindly
and
calmly
*NL*
expressed
the
pleasure
she
felt
in
seeing
me
well
enough
to
be
able
to
*NL*
come
down
;
Diana
took
my
hand
:
she
shook
her
head
at
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
have
waited
for
my
leave
to
descend
,
''
she
said
.
``
You
still
*NL*
look
very
pale
--
and
so
thin
!
Poor
child
!
--
poor
girl
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Diana
had
a
voice
toned
,
to
my
ear
,
like
the
cooing
of
a
dove
.
She
*NL*
possessed
eyes
whose
gaze
I
delighted
to
encounter
.
Her
whole
face
*NL*
seemed
to
me
full
of
charm
.
Mary
's
countenance
was
equally
*NL*
intelligent
--
her
features
equally
pretty
;
but
her
expression
was
more
*NL*
reserved
,
and
her
manners
,
though
gentle
,
more
distant
.
Diana
looked
and
*NL*
spoke
with
a
certain
authority
:
she
had
a
will
,
evidently
.
It
was
my
*NL*
nature
to
feel
pleasure
in
yielding
to
an
authority
supported
like
hers
,
*NL*
and
to
bend
,
where
my
conscience
and
self-respect
permitted
,
to
an
active
*NL*
will
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
business
have
you
here
?
''
she
continued
.
``
It
is
not
your
place
.
*NL*
Mary
and
I
sit
in
the
kitchen
sometimes
,
because
at
home
we
like
to
be
*NL*
free
,
even
to
license
--
but
you
are
a
visitor
,
and
must
go
into
the
*NL*
parlour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
well
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
,
with
Hannah
bustling
about
and
covering
you
with
flour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Besides
,
the
fire
is
too
hot
for
you
,
''
interposed
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
,
''
added
her
sister
.
``
Come
,
you
must
be
obedient
.
''
And
still
*NL*
holding
my
hand
she
made
me
rise
,
and
led
me
into
the
inner
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sit
there
,
''
she
said
,
placing
me
on
the
sofa
,
``
while
we
take
our
things
*NL*
off
and
get
the
tea
ready
;
it
is
another
privilege
we
exercise
in
our
*NL*
little
moorland
home
--
to
prepare
our
own
meals
when
we
are
so
inclined
,
*NL*
or
when
Hannah
is
baking
,
brewing
,
washing
,
or
ironing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
closed
the
door
,
leaving
me
solus
with
Mr.
St.
John
,
who
sat
*NL*
opposite
,
a
book
or
newspaper
in
his
hand
.
I
examined
first
,
the
*NL*
parlour
,
and
then
its
occupant
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
parlour
was
rather
a
small
room
,
very
plainly
furnished
,
yet
*NL*
comfortable
,
because
clean
and
neat
.
The
old-fashioned
chairs
were
very
*NL*
bright
,
and
the
walnut-wood
table
was
like
a
looking-glass
.
A
few
*NL*
strange
,
antique
portraits
of
the
men
and
women
of
other
days
decorated
*NL*
the
stained
walls
;
a
cupboard
with
glass
doors
contained
some
books
and
*NL*
an
ancient
set
of
china
.
There
was
no
superfluous
ornament
in
the
*NL*
room
--
not
one
modern
piece
of
furniture
,
save
a
brace
of
workboxes
and
a
*NL*
lady
's
desk
in
rosewood
,
which
stood
on
a
side-table
:
*NL*
everything
--
including
the
carpet
and
curtains
--
looked
at
once
well
worn
*NL*
and
well
saved
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
St.
John
--
sitting
as
still
as
one
of
the
dusty
pictures
on
the
walls
,
*NL*
keeping
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
page
he
perused
,
and
his
lips
mutely
*NL*
sealed
--
was
easy
enough
to
examine
.
Had
he
been
a
statue
instead
of
a
*NL*
man
,
he
could
not
have
been
easier
.
He
was
young
--
perhaps
from
twenty
-
*NL*
eight
to
thirty
--
tall
,
slender
;
his
face
riveted
the
eye
;
it
was
like
a
*NL*
Greek
face
,
very
pure
in
outline
:
quite
a
straight
,
classic
nose
;
quite
*NL*
an
Athenian
mouth
and
chin
.
It
is
seldom
,
indeed
,
an
English
face
comes
*NL*
so
near
the
antique
models
as
did
his
.
He
might
well
be
a
little
shocked
*NL*
at
the
irregularity
of
my
lineaments
,
his
own
being
so
harmonious
.
His
*NL*
eyes
were
large
and
blue
,
with
brown
lashes
;
his
high
forehead
,
*NL*
colourless
as
ivory
,
was
partially
streaked
over
by
careless
locks
of
*NL*
fair
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
a
gentle
delineation
,
is
it
not
,
reader
?
Yet
he
whom
it
*NL*
describes
scarcely
impressed
one
with
the
idea
of
a
gentle
,
a
yielding
,
*NL*
an
impressible
,
or
even
of
a
placid
nature
.
Quiescent
as
he
now
sat
,
*NL*
there
was
something
about
his
nostril
,
his
mouth
,
his
brow
,
which
,
to
my
*NL*
perceptions
,
indicated
elements
within
either
restless
,
or
hard
,
or
*NL*
eager
.
He
did
not
speak
to
me
one
word
,
nor
even
direct
to
me
one
*NL*
glance
,
till
his
sisters
returned
.
Diana
,
as
she
passed
in
and
out
,
in
*NL*
the
course
of
preparing
tea
,
brought
me
a
little
cake
,
baked
on
the
top
*NL*
of
the
oven
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eat
that
now
,
''
she
said
:
``
you
must
be
hungry
.
Hannah
says
you
have
had
*NL*
nothing
but
some
gruel
since
breakfast
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
not
refuse
it
,
for
my
appetite
was
awakened
and
keen
.
Mr.
Rivers
*NL*
now
closed
his
book
,
approached
the
table
,
and
,
as
he
took
a
seat
,
fixed
*NL*
his
blue
pictorial-looking
eyes
full
on
me
.
There
was
an
unceremonious
*NL*
directness
,
a
searching
,
decided
steadfastness
in
his
gaze
now
,
which
*NL*
told
that
intention
,
and
not
diffidence
,
had
hitherto
kept
it
averted
*NL*
from
the
stranger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very
hungry
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
,
sir
.
''
It
is
my
way
--
it
always
was
my
way
,
by
instinct
--
ever
to
*NL*
meet
the
brief
with
brevity
,
the
direct
with
plainness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
well
for
you
that
a
low
fever
has
forced
you
to
abstain
for
the
*NL*
last
three
days
:
there
would
have
been
danger
in
yielding
to
the
cravings
*NL*
of
your
appetite
at
first
.
Now
you
may
eat
,
though
still
not
*NL*
immoderately
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
trust
I
shall
not
eat
long
at
your
expense
,
sir
,
''
was
my
very
clumsily
-
*NL*
contrived
,
unpolished
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
he
said
coolly
:
``
when
you
have
indicated
to
us
the
residence
of
*NL*
your
friends
,
we
can
write
to
them
,
and
you
may
be
restored
to
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
,
I
must
plainly
tell
you
,
is
out
of
my
power
to
do
;
being
*NL*
absolutely
without
home
and
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
three
looked
at
me
,
but
not
distrustfully
;
I
felt
there
was
no
*NL*
suspicion
in
their
glances
:
there
was
more
of
curiosity
.
I
speak
*NL*
particularly
of
the
young
ladies
.
St.
John
's
eyes
,
though
clear
enough
*NL*
in
a
literal
sense
,
in
a
figurative
one
were
difficult
to
fathom
.
He
*NL*
seemed
to
use
them
rather
as
instruments
to
search
other
people
's
*NL*
thoughts
,
than
as
agents
to
reveal
his
own
:
the
which
combination
of
*NL*
keenness
and
reserve
was
considerably
more
calculated
to
embarrass
than
*NL*
to
encourage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
to
say
,
''
he
asked
,
``
that
you
are
completely
isolated
from
*NL*
every
connection
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
.
Not
a
tie
links
me
to
any
living
thing
:
not
a
claim
do
I
possess
*NL*
to
admittance
under
any
roof
in
England
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
most
singular
position
at
your
age
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
I
saw
his
glance
directed
to
my
hands
,
which
were
folded
on
the
*NL*
table
before
me
.
I
wondered
what
he
sought
there
:
his
words
soon
*NL*
explained
the
quest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
never
been
married
?
You
are
a
spinster
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Diana
laughed
.
``
Why
,
she
ca
n't
be
above
seventeen
or
eighteen
years
old
,
*NL*
St.
John
,
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
near
nineteen
:
but
I
am
not
married
.
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
a
burning
glow
mount
to
my
face
;
for
bitter
and
agitating
*NL*
recollections
were
awakened
by
the
allusion
to
marriage
.
They
all
saw
*NL*
the
embarrassment
and
the
emotion
.
Diana
and
Mary
relieved
me
by
turning
*NL*
their
eyes
elsewhere
than
to
my
crimsoned
visage
;
but
the
colder
and
*NL*
sterner
brother
continued
to
gaze
,
till
the
trouble
he
had
excited
forced
*NL*
out
tears
as
well
as
colour
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
did
you
last
reside
?
''
he
now
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
too
inquisitive
,
St.
John
,
''
murmured
Mary
in
a
low
voice
;
but
he
*NL*
leaned
over
the
table
and
required
an
answer
by
a
second
firm
and
*NL*
piercing
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
name
of
the
place
where
,
and
of
the
person
with
whom
I
lived
,
is
my
*NL*
secret

''
I
replied
concisely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
,
if
you
like
,
you
have
,
in
my
opinion
,
a
right
to
keep

both
from

St.
John
and
every
other
questioner

remarked
Diana
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
if
I
know
nothing
about
you
or
your
history
,
I
can
not
help
you
,
''
he
*NL*
said
.
``
And
you
need
help
,
do
you
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
need
it
,
and
I
seek
it
so
far

sir
,
that
some
true
philanthropist
will
*NL*
put
me
in
the
way
of
getting
work
which
I
can
do
,
and
the
remuneration
*NL*
for
which
will
keep
me

in

barest
necessaries

know
not
whether

of
my

purpose
so
honest

First

*NL*
*NL*
I
had
now
swallowed
my
tea
.
I
was
mightily
refreshed
by
the
beverage
;
as
*NL*
much
so
as
a
giant
with
wine
:
it
gave
new
tone
to
my
unstrung
nerves
,
and
*NL*
enabled
me
to
address
this
penetrating
young
judge
steadily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Rivers
,
''
I
said
,
turning
to
him
,
and
looking
at
him
,
as
he
looked
at
*NL*
me
,
openly
and
without
diffidence
,
``

rescued

noble
hospitality

This
benefit
conferred
gives

a
claim

will
tell

harboured

I
can
tell

I
have
heard
of
Mr.
Brocklehurst
,
and
I
have
seen
the
school
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
left
Lowood
nearly
a
year
since
to
become
a
private
governess
.
I
*NL*
obtained
a
good
situation
,
and
was
happy
.
This
place
I
was
obliged
to
*NL*
leave
four
days
before
I
came
here
.
The
reason
of
my
departure
I
can
not
*NL*
and
ought
not
to
explain
:
it
would
be
useless
,
dangerous
,
and
would
sound
*NL*
incredible
.
No
blame
attached
to
me
:
I
am
as
free
from
culpability
as
*NL*
any
one
of
you
three
.
Miserable
I
am
,
and
must
be
for
a
time
;
for
the
*NL*
catastrophe
which
drove
me
from
a
house
I
had
found
a
paradise
was
of
a
*NL*
strange
and
direful
nature
.
I
observed
but
two
points
in
planning
my
*NL*
departure
--
speed
,
secrecy
:
to
secure
these
,
I
had
to
leave
behind
me
*NL*
everything
I
possessed
except
a
small
parcel
;
which
,
in
my
hurry
and
*NL*
trouble
of
mind
,
I
forgot
to
take
out
of
the
coach
that
brought
me
to
*NL*
Whitcross
.
To
this
neighbourhood
,
then
,
I
came
,
quite
destitute
.
I
*NL*
slept
two
nights
in
the
open
air
,
and
wandered
about
two
days
without
*NL*
crossing
a
threshold
:
but
twice
in
that
space
of
time
did
I
taste
food
;
*NL*
and
it
was
when
brought
by
hunger
,
exhaustion
,
and
despair
almost
to
the
*NL*
last
gasp
,
that
you
,
Mr.
Rivers
,
forbade
me
to
perish
of
want
at
your
*NL*
door
,
and
took
me
under
the
shelter
of
your
roof
.
I
know
all
your
*NL*
sisters
have
done
for
me
since
--
for
I
have
not
been
insensible
during
my
*NL*
seeming
torpor
--
and
I
owe
to
their
spontaneous
,
genuine
,
genial
*NL*
compassion
as
large
a
debt
as
to
your
evangelical
charity
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
make
her
talk
any
more
now

St.
John

''
said
Diana
,
as
I
paused
;
*NL*
``
she
is
evidently
not
yet
fit

Come
to
the
sofa
and
sit
*NL*
down
now

Elliott

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
gave
an
involuntary
half
start
at
hearing
the
_
alias
_
:
I
had
forgotten
*NL*
my
new
name
.
Mr.
Rivers
,
whom
nothing
seemed
to
escape
,
noticed
it
at
*NL*
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
said
your
name
was
Jane
Elliott
?
''
he
observed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
say
so
;
and
it
is
the
name
by
which
I
think
it
expedient
to
be
*NL*
called
at
present
,
but
it
is
not
my
real
name
,
and
when
I
hear
it
,
it
*NL*
sounds
strange
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
real
name
you
will
not
give

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I
fear
discovery

I

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

Diana
.
``
Now

*NL*
*NL*
But
when
St.
John
had
mused
a
few
moments
he
recommenced
as
imperturbably
*NL*
and
with
as
much
acumen
as
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
not

quite
sensible

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do

have
already

Show

*NL*
``
Indeed

Diana
,
putting
her
white
hand
on
my

head
.
``
You
_
shall

''
repeated
Mary
,
in
the
tone
of
undemonstrative
*NL*
sincerity
which
seemed
natural
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My

said
Mr.

driven
through

more
inclination

put
you
in

way
of
keeping
yourself

shall
*NL*
endeavour
to
do
so

observe
,
my
sphere
is
narrow

am
but
the

*NL*
``

Mr.

quite
coolly

*NL*
He
now
resumed
the
book
with
which
he
had
been
occupied
before
tea
.
I
*NL*
soon
withdrew
,
for
I
had
talked
as
much
,
and
sat
up
as
long

as
my

strength
would
permit

CHAPTER
XXX
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
more
I
knew
of
the
inmates
of
Moor
House
,
the
better
I
liked
them
.
In
*NL*
a
few
days
I
had
so
far
recovered
my
health
that
I
could
sit
up
all
day
,
*NL*
and
walk
out
sometimes
.
I
could
join
with
Diana
and
Mary
in
all
their
*NL*
occupations
;
converse
with
them
as
much
as
they
wished
,
and
aid
them
when
*NL*
and
where
they
would
allow
me
.
There
was
a
reviving
pleasure
in
this
*NL*
intercourse
,
of
a
kind
now
tasted
by
me
for
the
first
time
--
the
pleasure
*NL*
arising
from
perfect
congeniality
of
tastes
,
sentiments
,
and
principles
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
liked
to
read
what
they
liked
to
read
:
what
they
enjoyed
,
delighted
me
;
*NL*
what
they
approved
,
I
reverenced
.
They
loved
their
sequestered
home
.
I
,
*NL*
too
,
in
the
grey
,
small
,
antique
structure
,
with
its
low
roof
,
its
*NL*
latticed
casements
,
its
mouldering
walls
,
its
avenue
of
aged
firs
--
all
*NL*
grown
aslant
under
the
stress
of
mountain
winds
;
its
garden
,
dark
with
*NL*
yew
and
holly
--
and
where
no
flowers
but
of
the
hardiest
species
would
*NL*
bloom
--
found
a
charm
both
potent
and
permanent
.
They
clung
to
the
purple
*NL*
moors
behind
and
around
their
dwelling
--
to
the
hollow
vale
into
which
the
*NL*
pebbly
bridle-path
leading
from
their
gate
descended
,
and
which
wound
*NL*
between
fern-banks
first
,
and
then
amongst
a
few
of
the
wildest
little
*NL*
pasture-fields
that
ever
bordered
a
wilderness
of
heath
,
or
gave
*NL*
sustenance
to
a
flock
of
grey
moorland
sheep
,
with
their
little
mossy
-
*NL*
faced
lambs
:
--
they
clung
to
this
scene
,
I
say
,
with
a
perfect
enthusiasm
*NL*
of
attachment
.
I
could
comprehend
the
feeling
,
and
share
both
its
*NL*
strength
and
truth
.
I
saw
the
fascination
of
the
locality
.
I
felt
the
*NL*
consecration
of
its
loneliness
:
my
eye
feasted
on
the
outline
of
swell
*NL*
and
sweep
--
on
the
wild
colouring
communicated
to
ridge
and
dell
by
moss
,
*NL*
by
heath-bell
,
by
flower-sprinkled
turf
,
by
brilliant
bracken
,
and
mellow
*NL*
granite
crag
.
These
details
were
just
to
me
what
they
were
to
them
--
so
*NL*
many
pure
and
sweet
sources
of
pleasure
.
The
strong
blast
and
the
soft
*NL*
breeze
;
the
rough
and
the
halcyon
day
;
the
hours
of
sunrise
and
sunset
;
*NL*
the
moonlight
and
the
clouded
night
,
developed
for
me
,
in
these
regions
,
*NL*
the
same
attraction
as
for
them
--
wound
round
my
faculties
the
same
spell
*NL*
that
entranced
theirs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Indoors
we
agreed
equally
well
.
They
were
both
more
accomplished
and
*NL*
better
read
than
I
was
;
but
with
eagerness
I
followed
in
the
path
of
*NL*
knowledge
they
had
trodden
before
me
.
I
devoured
the
books
they
lent
me
:
*NL*
then
it
was
full
satisfaction
to
discuss
with
them
in
the
evening
what
I
*NL*
had
perused
during
the
day
.
Thought
fitted
thought
;
opinion
met
opinion
:
*NL*
we
coincided
,
in
short
,
perfectly
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
in
our
trio
there
was
a
superior
and
a
leader
,
it
was
Diana
.
*NL*
Physically
,
she
far
excelled
me
:
she
was
handsome
;
she
was
vigorous
.
In
*NL*
her
animal
spirits
there
was
an
affluence
of
life
and
certainty
of
flow
,
*NL*
such
as
excited
my
wonder
,
while
it
baffled
my
comprehension
.
I
could
*NL*
talk
a
while
when
the
evening
commenced
,
but
the
first
gush
of
vivacity
*NL*
and
fluency
gone
,
I
was
fain
to
sit
on
a
stool
at
Diana
's
feet
,
to
rest
*NL*
my
head
on
her
knee
,
and
listen
alternately
to
her
and
Mary
,
while
they
*NL*
sounded
thoroughly
the
topic
on
which
I
had
but
touched
.
Diana
offered
*NL*
to
teach
me
German
.
I
liked
to
learn
of
her
:
I
saw
the
part
of
*NL*
instructress
pleased
and
suited
her
;
that
of
scholar
pleased
and
suited
*NL*
me
no
less
.
Our
natures
dovetailed
:
mutual
affection
--
of
the
strongest
*NL*
kind
--
was
the
result
.
They
discovered
I
could
draw
:
their
pencils
and
*NL*
colour-boxes
were
immediately
at
my
service
.
My
skill
,
greater
in
this
*NL*
one
point
than
theirs
,
surprised
and
charmed
them
.
Mary
would
sit
and
*NL*
watch
me
by
the
hour
together
:
then
she
would
take
lessons
;
and
a
docile
,
*NL*
intelligent
,
assiduous
pupil
she
made
.
Thus
occupied
,
and
mutually
*NL*
entertained
,
days
passed
like
hours
,
and
weeks
like
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
Mr.
St
John
,
the
intimacy
which
had
arisen
so
naturally
and
rapidly
*NL*
between
me
and
his
sisters
did
not
extend
to
him
.
One
reason
of
the
*NL*
distance
yet
observed
between
us
was
,
that
he
was
comparatively
seldom
at
*NL*
home
:
a
large
proportion
of
his
time
appeared
devoted
to
visiting
the
*NL*
sick
and
poor
among
the
scattered
population
of
his
parish
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
weather
seemed
to
hinder
him
in
these
pastoral
excursions
:
rain
or
*NL*
fair
,
he
would
,
when
his
hours
of
morning
study
were
over
,
take
his
hat
,
*NL*
and
,
followed
by
his
father
's
old
pointer
,
Carlo
,
go
out
on
his
mission
*NL*
of
love
or
duty
--
I
scarcely
know
in
which
light
he
regarded
it
.
*NL*
Sometimes
,
when
the
day
was
very
unfavourable
,
his
sisters
would
*NL*
expostulate
.
He
would
then
say
,
with
a
peculiar
smile
,
more
solemn
than
*NL*
cheerful
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
if
I
let
a
gust
of
wind
or
a
sprinkling
of
rain
turn
me
aside
from
*NL*
these
easy
tasks
,
what
preparation
would
such
sloth
be
for
the
future
I
*NL*
propose
to
myself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Diana
and
Mary
's
general
answer
to
this
question
was
a
sigh
,
and
some
*NL*
minutes
of
apparently
mournful
meditation
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
besides
his
frequent
absences
,
there
was
another
barrier
to
*NL*
friendship
with
him
:
he
seemed
of
a
reserved
,
an
abstracted
,
and
even
of
*NL*
a
brooding
nature
.
Zealous
in
his
ministerial
labours
,
blameless
in
his
*NL*
life
and
habits
,
he
yet
did
not
appear
to
enjoy
that
mental
serenity
,
*NL*
that
inward
content
,
which
should
be
the
reward
of
every
sincere
*NL*
Christian
and
practical
philanthropist
.
Often
,
of
an
evening
,
when
he
*NL*
sat
at
the
window
,
his
desk
and
papers
before
him
,
he
would
cease
reading
*NL*
or
writing
,
rest
his
chin
on
his
hand
,
and
deliver
himself
up
to
I
know
*NL*
not
what
course
of
thought
;
but
that
it
was
perturbed
and
exciting
might
*NL*
be
seen
in
the
frequent
flash
and
changeful
dilation
of
his
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
think
,
moreover
,
that
Nature
was
not
to
him
that
treasury
of
delight
it
*NL*
was
to
his
sisters
.
He
expressed
once
,
and
but
once
in
my
hearing
,
a
*NL*
strong
sense
of
the
rugged
charm
of
the
hills
,
and
an
inborn
affection
*NL*
for
the
dark
roof
and
hoary
walls
he
called
his
home
;
but
there
was
more
*NL*
of
gloom
than
pleasure
in
the
tone
and
words
in
which
the
sentiment
was
*NL*
manifested
;
and
never
did
he
seem
to
roam
the
moors
for
the
sake
of
their
*NL*
soothing
silence
--
never
seek
out
or
dwell
upon
the
thousand
peaceful
*NL*
delights
they
could
yield
.
*NL*
*NL*
Incommunicative
as
he
was
,
some
time
elapsed
before
I
had
an
opportunity
*NL*
of
gauging
his
mind
.
I
first
got
an
idea
of
its
calibre
when
I
heard
him
*NL*
preach
in
his
own
church
at
Morton
.
I
wish
I
could
describe
that
sermon
:
*NL*
but
it
is
past
my
power
.
I
can
not
even
render
faithfully
the
effect
it
*NL*
produced
on
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
began
calm
--
and
indeed
,
as
far
as
delivery
and
pitch
of
voice
went
,
it
*NL*
was
calm
to
the
end
:
an
earnestly
felt
,
yet
strictly
restrained
zeal
*NL*
breathed
soon
in
the
distinct
accents
,
and
prompted
the
nervous
language
.
*NL*
This
grew
to
force
--
compressed
,
condensed
,
controlled
.
The
heart
was
*NL*
thrilled
,
the
mind
astonished
,
by
the
power
of
the
preacher
:
neither
were
*NL*
softened
.
Throughout
there
was
a
strange
bitterness
;
an
absence
of
*NL*
consolatory
gentleness
;
stern
allusions
to
Calvinistic
*NL*
doctrines
--
election
,
predestination
,
reprobation
--
were
frequent
;
and
each
*NL*
reference
to
these
points
sounded
like
a
sentence
pronounced
for
doom
.
*NL*
When
he
had
done
,
instead
of
feeling
better
,
calmer
,
more
enlightened
by
*NL*
his
discourse
,
I
experienced
an
inexpressible
sadness
;
for
it
seemed
to
*NL*
me
--
I
know
not
whether
equally
so
to
others
--
that
the
eloquence
to
which
*NL*
I
had
been
listening
had
sprung
from
a
depth
where
lay
turbid
dregs
of
*NL*
disappointment
--
where
moved
troubling
impulses
of
insatiate
yearnings
and
*NL*
disquieting
aspirations
.
I
was
sure
St.
John
Rivers
--
pure-lived
,
*NL*
conscientious
,
zealous
as
he
was
--
had
not
yet
found
that
peace
of
God
*NL*
which
passeth
all
understanding
:
he
had
no
more
found
it
,
I
thought
,
than
*NL*
had
I
with
my
concealed
and
racking
regrets
for
my
broken
idol
and
lost
*NL*
elysium
--
regrets
to
which
I
have
latterly
avoided
referring
,
but
which
*NL*
possessed
me
and
tyrannised
over
me
ruthlessly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meantime
a
month
was
gone
.
Diana
and
Mary
were
soon
to
leave
Moor
House
,
*NL*
and
return
to
the
far
different
life
and
scene
which
awaited
them
,
as
*NL*
governesses
in
a
large
,
fashionable
,
south-of-England
city
,
where
each
*NL*
held
a
situation
in
families
by
whose
wealthy
and
haughty
members
they
*NL*
were
regarded
only
as
humble
dependants
,
and
who
neither
knew
nor
sought
*NL*
out
their
innate
excellences
,
and
appreciated
only
their
acquired
*NL*
accomplishments
as
they
appreciated
the
skill
of
their
cook
or
the
taste
*NL*
of
their
waiting-woman
.
Mr.
St.
John
had
said
nothing
to
me
yet
about
*NL*
the
employment
he
had
promised
to
obtain
for
me
;
yet
it
became
urgent
*NL*
that
I
should
have
a
vocation
of
some
kind
.
One
morning
,
being
left
*NL*
alone
with
him
a
few
minutes
in
the
parlour
,
I
ventured
to
approach
the
*NL*
window-recess
--
which
his
table
,
chair
,
and
desk
consecrated
as
a
kind
of
*NL*
study
--
and
I
was
going
to
speak
,
though
not
very
well
knowing
in
what
*NL*
words
to
frame
my
inquiry
--
for
it
is
at
all
times
difficult
to
break
the
*NL*
ice
of
reserve
glassing
over
such
natures
as
his
--
when
he
saved
me
the
*NL*
trouble
by
being
the
first
to
commence
a
dialogue
.
*NL*
*NL*
Looking
up
as
I
drew
near
--
``
You
have
a
question
to
ask
of
me
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
wish
to
know
whether
you
have
heard
of
any
service
I
can
offer
*NL*
myself
to
undertake
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
found
or
devised
something
for
you
three
weeks
ago
;
but
as
you
seemed
*NL*
both
useful
and
happy
here
--
as
my
sisters
had
evidently
become
attached
*NL*
to
you
,
and
your
society
gave
them
unusual
pleasure
--
I
deemed
it
*NL*
inexpedient
to
break
in
on
your
mutual
comfort
till
their
approaching
*NL*
departure
from
Marsh
End
should
render
yours
necessary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
they
will
go
in
three
days
now
?
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
and
when
they
go
,
I
shall
return
to
the
parsonage
at
Morton
:
Hannah
*NL*
will
accompany
me
;
and
this
old
house
will
be
shut
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
waited
a
few
moments
,
expecting
he
would
go
on
with
the
subject
first
*NL*
broached
:
but
he
seemed
to
have
entered
another
train
of
reflection
:
his
*NL*
look
denoted
abstraction
from
me
and
my
business
.
I
was
obliged
to
*NL*
recall
him
to
a
theme
which
was
of
necessity
one
of
close
and
anxious
*NL*
interest
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
employment
you
had
in
view
,
Mr.
Rivers
?
I
hope
this
delay
*NL*
will
not
have
increased
the
difficulty
of
securing
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
;
since
it
is
an
employment
which
depends
only
on
me
to
give
,
and
*NL*
you
to
accept
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
again
paused
:
there
seemed
a
reluctance
to
continue
.
I
grew
*NL*
impatient
:
a
restless
movement
or
two
,
and
an
eager
and
exacting
glance
*NL*
fastened
on
his
face
,
conveyed
the
feeling
to
him
as
effectually
as
words
*NL*
could
have
done
,
and
with
less
trouble
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
need
be
in
no
hurry
to
hear
,
''
he
said
:
``
let
me
frankly
tell
you
,
I
*NL*
have
nothing
eligible
or
profitable
to
suggest
.
Before
I
explain
,
*NL*
recall
,
if
you
please
,
my
notice
,
clearly
given
,
that
if
I
helped
you
,
it
*NL*
must
be
as
the
blind
man
would
help
the
lame
.
I
am
poor
;
for
I
find
*NL*
that
,
when
I
have
paid
my
father
's
debts
,
all
the
patrimony
remaining
to
*NL*
me
will
be
this
crumbling
grange
,
the
row
of
scathed
firs
behind
,
and
the
*NL*
patch
of
moorish
soil
,
with
the
yew-trees
and
holly-bushes
in
front
.
I
*NL*
am
obscure
:
Rivers
is
an
old
name
;
but
of
the
three
sole
descendants
of
*NL*
the
race
,
two
earn
the
dependant
's
crust
among
strangers
,
and
the
third
*NL*
considers
himself
an
alien
from
his
native
country
--
not
only
for
life
,
*NL*
but
in
death
.
Yes
,
and
deems
,
and
is
bound
to
deem
,
himself
honoured
by
*NL*
the
lot
,
and
aspires
but
after
the
day
when
the
cross
of
separation
from
*NL*
fleshly
ties
shall
be
laid
on
his
shoulders
,
and
when
the
Head
of
that
*NL*
church-militant
of
whose
humblest
members
he
is
one
,
shall
give
the
word
,
*NL*
`
Rise
,
follow
Me
!
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
St.
John
said
these
words
as
he
pronounced
his
sermons
,
with
a
quiet
,
*NL*
deep
voice
;
with
an
unflushed
cheek
,
and
a
coruscating
radiance
of
*NL*
glance
.
He
resumed
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
since
I
am
myself
poor
and
obscure
,
I
can
offer
you
but
a
service
of
*NL*
poverty
and
obscurity
.
_
You
_
may
even
think
it
degrading
--
for
I
see
now
*NL*
your
habits
have
been
what
the
world
calls
refined
:
your
tastes
lean
to
*NL*
the
ideal
,
and
your
society
has
at
least
been
amongst
the
educated
;
but
*NL*
_
I
_
consider
that
no
service
degrades
which
can
better
our
race
.
I
hold
*NL*
that
the
more
arid
and
unreclaimed
the
soil
where
the
Christian
*NL*
labourer
's
task
of
tillage
is
appointed
him
--
the
scantier
the
meed
his
*NL*
toil
brings
--
the
higher
the
honour
.
His
,
under
such
circumstances
,
is
*NL*
the
destiny
of
the
pioneer
;
and
the
first
pioneers
of
the
Gospel
were
the
*NL*
Apostles
--
their
captain
was
Jesus
,
the
Redeemer
,
Himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
I
said
,
as
he
again
paused
--
``
proceed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
me
before
he
proceeded
:
indeed
,
he
seemed
leisurely
to
read
*NL*
my
face
,
as
if
its
features
and
lines
were
characters
on
a
page
.
The
*NL*
conclusions
drawn
from
this
scrutiny
he
partially
expressed
in
his
*NL*
succeeding
observations
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
you
will
accept
the
post
I
offer
you
,
''
said
he
,
``
and
hold
it
*NL*
for
a
while
:
not
permanently
,
though
:
any
more
than
I
could
permanently
*NL*
keep
the
narrow
and
narrowing
--
the
tranquil
,
hidden
office
of
English
*NL*
country
incumbent
;
for
in
your
nature
is
an
alloy
as
detrimental
to
*NL*
repose
as
that
in
mine
,
though
of
a
different
kind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
explain
,
''
I
urged
,
when
he
halted
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
;
and
you
shall
hear
how
poor
the
proposal
is
,
--
how
trivial
--
how
*NL*
cramping
.
I
shall
not
stay
long
at
Morton
,
now
that
my
father
is
dead
,
*NL*
and
that
I
am
my
own
master
.
I
shall
leave
the
place
probably
in
the
*NL*
course
of
a
twelve-month
;
but
while
I
do
stay
,
I
will
exert
myself
to
the
*NL*
utmost
for
its
improvement
.
Morton
,
when
I
came
to
it
two
years
ago
,
had
*NL*
no
school
:
the
children
of
the
poor
were
excluded
from
every
hope
of
*NL*
progress
.
I
established
one
for
boys
:
I
mean
now
to
open
a
second
school
*NL*
for
girls
.
I
have
hired
a
building
for
the
purpose
,
with
a
cottage
of
*NL*
two
rooms
attached
to
it
for
the
mistress
's
house
.
Her
salary
will
be
*NL*
thirty
pounds
a
year
:
her
house
is
already
furnished
,
very
simply
,
but
*NL*
sufficiently
,
by
the
kindness
of
a
lady
,
Miss
Oliver
;
the
only
daughter
*NL*
of
the
sole
rich
man
in
my
parish
--
Mr.
Oliver
,
the
proprietor
of
a
needle
-
*NL*
factory
and
iron-foundry
in
the
valley
.
The
same
lady
pays
for
the
*NL*
education
and
clothing
of
an
orphan
from
the
workhouse
,
on
condition
that
*NL*
she
shall
aid
the
mistress
in
such
menial
offices
connected
with
her
own
*NL*
house
and
the
school
as
her
occupation
of
teaching
will
prevent
her
*NL*
having
time
to
discharge
in
person
.
Will
you
be
this
mistress
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
put
the
question
rather
hurriedly
;
he
seemed
half
to
expect
an
*NL*
indignant
,
or
at
least
a
disdainful
rejection
of
the
offer
:
not
knowing
*NL*
all
my
thoughts
and
feelings
,
though
guessing
some
,
he
could
not
tell
in
*NL*
what
light
the
lot
would
appear
to
me
.
In
truth
it
was
humble
--
but
then
*NL*
it
was
sheltered
,
and
I
wanted
a
safe
asylum
:
it
was
plodding
--
but
then
,
*NL*
compared
with
that
of
a
governess
in
a
rich
house
,
it
was
independent
;
*NL*
and
the
fear
of
servitude
with
strangers
entered
my
soul
like
iron
:
it
*NL*
was
not
ignoble
--
not
unworthy
--
not
mentally
degrading
,
I
made
my
*NL*
decision
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thank
you
for
the
proposal
,
Mr.
Rivers
,
and
I
accept
it
with
all
my
*NL*
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
comprehend
me
?
''
he
said
.
``
It
is
a
village
school
:
your
scholars
*NL*
will
be
only
poor
girls

cottagers

children

the
best
,
farmers
'
*NL*
daughters

Knitting
,
sewing
,
reading
,
writing
,
ciphering
,
will
be
all
*NL*
you
will
have
to
teach
.
What
will
you
do
with
your
accomplishments
?
*NL*
What
,
with
the
largest
portion
of
your
mind
--
sentiments

*NL*
*NL*
``
Save
them

they
are

They

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
what
you
undertake
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do

*NL*
*NL*
He
now
smiled
:
and
not
a
bitter
or
a
sad
smile
,
but
one
well
pleased
and
*NL*
deeply
gratified
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
when
will
you
commence
the
exercise
of
your
function

*NL*
*NL*
``

week
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well

so
be
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
rose
and
walked
through
the
room
.
Standing
still
,
he
again
looked
at
*NL*
me
.
He
shook
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
disapprove
of
,
Mr.
Rivers
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
not
stay
at
Morton
long
:
no
,
no

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
What
is
your
reason
for
saying
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
read
it
in
your
eye
;
it
is
not
of
that
description
which
promises
the

maintenance

an
even
tenor
in
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
ambitious
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
started
at
the
word
``
ambitious
.
''
He
repeated
,
``
No
.
What
made
you
*NL*
think
of
ambition
?
Who
is
ambitious

I
know
I
am

how
did
you
find
*NL*
it
out

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

speaking

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

you
are

He
paused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
going
to
say
,
impassioned
:
but
perhaps
you
would
have
*NL*
misunderstood
the
word
,
and
been
displeased
.
I
mean
,
that
human
*NL*
affections
and
sympathies
have
a
most
powerful
hold
on
you
.
I
am
sure
*NL*
you
can
not
long
be
content
to
pass
your
leisure
in
solitude
,
and
to
*NL*
devote
your
working
hours
to
a
monotonous
labour
wholly
void
of
stimulus

*NL*
any
more
than
I
can
be
content

''
he
added
,
with
emphasis
,
``
to
live
here
*NL*
buried
in
morass
,
pent
in
with
mountains

my
nature
,
that
God
gave
me
,
*NL*
contravened
;
my
faculties
,
heaven-bestowed
,
paralysed

made
useless

You
*NL*
hear
now
how
I
contradict
myself

I
,
who
preached
contentment
with
a
*NL*
humble
lot
,
and
justified
the
vocation
even
of
hewers
of
wood
and
drawers
*NL*
of
water
in
God
's
service
--
I
,
His
ordained
minister
,
almost
rave
in
my
*NL*
restlessness
.
Well
,
propensities
and
principles
must
be
reconciled
by
*NL*
some
means
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
left
the
room
.
In
this
brief
hour
I
had
learnt
more
of
him
than
in
*NL*
the
whole
previous
month
:
yet
still
he
puzzled
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Diana
and
Mary
Rivers
became
more
sad
and
silent
as
the
day
approached
*NL*
for
leaving
their
brother
and
their
home
.
They
both
tried
to
appear
as
*NL*
usual
;
but
the
sorrow
they
had
to
struggle
against
was
one
that
could
not
*NL*
be
entirely
conquered
or
concealed
.
Diana
intimated
that
this
would
be
a
*NL*
different
parting
from
any
they
had
ever
yet
known
.
It
would
probably
,
*NL*
as
far
as
St.
John
was
concerned
,
be
a
parting
for
years
:
it
might
be
a
*NL*
parting
for
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
will
sacrifice
all
to
his
long-framed
resolves
,
''
she
said
:
``
natural
*NL*
affection
and
feelings
more
potent
still
.
St.
John
looks
quiet
,
Jane
;
*NL*
but
he
hides
a
fever
in
his
vitals
.
You
would
think
him
gentle
,
yet
in
*NL*
some
things
he
is
inexorable
as
death
;
and
the
worst
of
it
is
,
my
*NL*
conscience
will
hardly
permit
me
to
dissuade
him
from
his
severe
*NL*
decision
:
certainly
,
I
can
not
for
a
moment
blame
him
for
it
.
It
is
*NL*
right
,
noble
,
Christian
:
yet
it
breaks
my
heart
!
''
And
the
tears
gushed
*NL*
to
her
fine
eyes
.
Mary
bent
her
head
low
over
her
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
now
without
father
:
we
shall
soon
be
without
home
and
brother
,
''
*NL*
she
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
a
little
accident
supervened
,
which
seemed
decreed
by
fate
*NL*
purposely
to
prove
the
truth
of
the
adage
,
that
``
misfortunes
never
come
*NL*
singly
,
''
and
to
add
to
their
distresses
the
vexing
one
of
the
slip
*NL*
between
the
cup
and
the
lip
.
St.
John
passed
the
window
reading
a
*NL*
letter
.
He
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
uncle
John
is
dead
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Both
the
sisters
seemed
struck
:
not
shocked
or
appalled
;
the
tidings
*NL*
appeared
in
their
eyes
rather
momentous
than
afflicting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dead
?
''
repeated
Diana
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
riveted
a
searching
gaze
on
her
brother
's
face
.
``
And
what
then
?
''
she
*NL*
demanded
,
in
a
low
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
then
,
Die
?
''
he
replied
,
maintaining
a
marble
immobility
of
feature
.
*NL*
``
What
then
?
Why
--
nothing
.
Read
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
threw
the
letter
into
her
lap
.
She
glanced
over
it
,
and
handed
it
to
*NL*
Mary
.
Mary
perused
it
in
silence
,
and
returned
it
to
her
brother
.
All
*NL*
three
looked
at
each
other
,
and
all
three
smiled
--
a
dreary
,
pensive
smile
*NL*
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Amen
!
We
can
yet
live
,
''
said
Diana
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
any
rate
,
it
makes
us
no
worse
off
than
we
were
before
,
''
remarked
*NL*
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
it
forces
rather
strongly
on
the
mind
the
picture
of
what
_
might
*NL*
have
been
_
,
''
said
Mr.
Rivers
,
``
and
contrasts
it
somewhat
too
vividly
with
*NL*
what
_
is
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
folded
the
letter
,
locked
it
in
his
desk
,
and
again
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
some
minutes
no
one
spoke
.
Diana
then
turned
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jane
,
you
will
wonder
at
us
and
our
mysteries
,
''
she
said
,
``
and
think
us
*NL*
hard-hearted
beings
not
to
be
more
moved
at
the
death
of
so
near
a
*NL*
relation
as
an
uncle
;
but
we
have
never
seen
him
or
known
him
.
He
was
my
*NL*
mother
's
brother
.
My
father
and
he
quarrelled
long
ago
.
It
was
by
his
*NL*
advice
that
my
father
risked
most
of
his
property
in
the
speculation
that
*NL*
ruined
him
.
Mutual
recrimination
passed
between
them
:
they
parted
in
*NL*
anger
,
and
were
never
reconciled
.
My
uncle
engaged
afterwards
in
more
*NL*
prosperous
undertakings
:
it
appears
he
realised
a
fortune
of
twenty
*NL*
thousand
pounds
.
He
was
never
married
,
and
had
no
near
kindred
but
*NL*
ourselves
and
one
other
person
,
not
more
closely
related
than
we
.
My
*NL*
father
always
cherished
the
idea
that
he
would
atone
for
his
error
by
*NL*
leaving
his
possessions
to
us
;
that
letter
informs
us
that
he
has
*NL*
bequeathed
every
penny
to
the
other
relation
,
with
the
exception
of
*NL*
thirty
guineas
,
to
be
divided
between
St.
John
,
Diana
,
and
Mary
Rivers
,
*NL*
for
the
purchase
of
three
mourning
rings
.
He
had
a
right
,
of
course
,
to
*NL*
do
as
he
pleased
:
and
yet
a
momentary
damp
is
cast
on
the
spirits
by
the
*NL*
receipt
of
such
news
.
Mary
and
I
would
have
esteemed
ourselves
rich
with
*NL*
a
thousand
pounds
each
;
and
to
St.
John
such
a
sum
would
have
been
*NL*
valuable
,
for
the
good
it
would
have
enabled
him
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
explanation
given
,
the
subject
was
dropped
,
and
no
further
reference
*NL*
made
to
it
by
either
Mr.
Rivers
or
his
sisters
.
The
next
day
I
left
*NL*
Marsh
End
for
Morton
.
The
day
after
,
Diana
and
Mary
quitted
it
for
*NL*
distant
B
-
.
In
a
week
,
Mr.
Rivers
and
Hannah
repaired
to
the
parsonage
:
*NL*
and
so
the
old
grange
was
abandoned
.

CHAPTER
XXXI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
My
home
,
then
,
when
I
at
last
find
a
home
,
--
is
a
cottage
;
a
little
room
*NL*
with
whitewashed
walls
and
a
sanded
floor
,
containing
four
painted
chairs
*NL*
and
a
table
,
a
clock
,
a
cupboard
,
with
two
or
three
plates
and
dishes
,
*NL*
and
a
set
of
tea-things
in
delf
.
Above
,
a
chamber
of
the
same
dimensions
*NL*
as
the
kitchen
,
with
a
deal
bedstead
and
chest
of
drawers
;
small
,
yet
too
*NL*
large
to
be
filled
with
my
scanty
wardrobe
:
though
the
kindness
of
my
*NL*
gentle
and
generous
friends
has
increased
that
,
by
a
modest
stock
of
such
*NL*
things
as
are
necessary
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
evening
.
I
have
dismissed
,
with
the
fee
of
an
orange
,
the
little
*NL*
orphan
who
serves
me
as
a
handmaid
.
I
am
sitting
alone
on
the
hearth
.
*NL*
This
morning
,
the
village
school
opened
.
I
had
twenty
scholars
.
But
*NL*
three
of
the
number
can
read
:
none
write
or
cipher
.
Several
knit
,
and
a
*NL*
few
sew
a
little
.
They
speak
with
the
broadest
accent
of
the
district
.
*NL*
At
present
,
they
and
I
have
a
difficulty
in
understanding
each
other
's
*NL*
language
.
Some
of
them
are
unmannered
,
rough
,
intractable
,
as
well
as
*NL*
ignorant
;
but
others
are
docile
,
have
a
wish
to
learn
,
and
evince
a
*NL*
disposition
that
pleases
me
.
I
must
not
forget
that
these
coarsely-clad
*NL*
little
peasants
are
of
flesh
and
blood
as
good
as
the
scions
of
gentlest
*NL*
genealogy
;
and
that
the
germs
of
native
excellence
,
refinement
,
*NL*
intelligence
,
kind
feeling
,
are
as
likely
to
exist
in
their
hearts
as
in
*NL*
those
of
the
best-born
.
My
duty
will
be
to
develop
these
germs
:
surely
I
*NL*
shall
find
some
happiness
in
discharging
that
office
.
Much
enjoyment
I
*NL*
do
not
expect
in
the
life
opening
before
me
:
yet
it
will
,
doubtless
,
if
I
*NL*
regulate
my
mind
,
and
exert
my
powers
as
I
ought
,
yield
me
enough
to
live
*NL*
on
from
day
to
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Was
I
very
gleeful
,
settled
,
content
,
during
the
hours
I
passed
in
yonder
*NL*
bare
,
humble
schoolroom
this
morning
and
afternoon
?
Not
to
deceive
*NL*
myself
,
I
must
reply
--
No
:
I
felt
desolate
to
a
degree
.
I
felt
--
yes
,
*NL*
idiot
that
I
am
--
I
felt
degraded
.
I
doubted
I
had
taken
a
step
which
*NL*
sank
instead
of
raising
me
in
the
scale
of
social
existence
.
I
was
*NL*
weakly
dismayed
at
the
ignorance
,
the
poverty
,
the
coarseness
of
all
I
*NL*
heard
and
saw
round
me
.
But
let
me
not
hate
and
despise
myself
too
much
*NL*
for
these
feelings
;
I
know
them
to
be
wrong
--
that
is
a
great
step
gained
;
*NL*
I
shall
strive
to
overcome
them
.
To-morrow
,
I
trust
,
I
shall
get
the
*NL*
better
of
them
partially
;
and
in
a
few
weeks
,
perhaps
,
they
will
be
quite
*NL*
subdued
.
In
a
few
months
,
it
is
possible
,
the
happiness
of
seeing
*NL*
progress
,
and
a
change
for
the
better
in
my
scholars
may
substitute
*NL*
gratification
for
disgust
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meantime
,
let
me
ask
myself
one
question
--
Which
is
better
?
--
To
have
*NL*
surrendered
to
temptation
;
listened
to
passion
;
made
no
painful
effort
--
no
*NL*
struggle
;
--
but
to
have
sunk
down
in
the
silken
snare
;
fallen
asleep
on
*NL*
the
flowers
covering
it
;
wakened
in
a
southern
clime
,
amongst
the
*NL*
luxuries
of
a
pleasure
villa
:
to
have
been
now
living
in
France
,
Mr.
*NL*
Rochester
's
mistress
;
delirious
with
his
love
half
my
time
--
for
he
*NL*
would
--
oh
,
yes
,
he
would
have
loved
me
well
for
a
while
.
He
_
did
_
love
*NL*
me
--
no
one
will
ever
love
me
so
again
.
I
shall
never
more
know
the
sweet
*NL*
homage
given
to
beauty
,
youth
,
and
grace
--
for
never
to
any
one
else
shall
*NL*
I
seem
to
possess
these
charms
.
He
was
fond
and
proud
of
me
--
it
is
what
*NL*
no
man
besides
will
ever
be
.
--
But
where
am
I
wandering
,
and
what
am
I
*NL*
saying
,
and
above
all
,
feeling
?
Whether
is
it
better
,
I
ask
,
to
be
a
*NL*
slave
in
a
fool
's
paradise
at
Marseilles
--
fevered
with
delusive
bliss
one
*NL*
hour
--
suffocating
with
the
bitterest
tears
of
remorse
and
shame
the
*NL*
next
--
or
to
be
a
village-schoolmistress
,
free
and
honest
,
in
a
breezy
*NL*
mountain
nook
in
the
healthy
heart
of
England
?
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
;
I
feel
now
that
I
was
right
when
I
adhered
to
principle
and
law
,
and
*NL*
scorned
and
crushed
the
insane
promptings
of
a
frenzied
moment
.
God
*NL*
directed
me
to
a
correct
choice
:
I
thank
His
providence
for
the
guidance
!
*NL*
*NL*
Having
brought
my
eventide
musings
to
this
point
,
I
rose
,
went
to
my
*NL*
door
,
and
looked
at
the
sunset
of
the
harvest-day
,
and
at
the
quiet
*NL*
fields
before
my
cottage
,
which
,
with
the
school
,
was
distant
half
a
mile
*NL*
from
the
village
.
The
birds
were
singing
their
last
strains
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
air
was
mild
,
the
dew
was
balm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
I
looked
,
I
thought
myself
happy
,
and
was
surprised
to
find
myself
*NL*
ere
long
weeping
--
and
why
?
For
the
doom
which
had
reft
me
from
adhesion
*NL*
to
my
master
:
for
him
I
was
no
more
to
see
;
for
the
desperate
grief
and
*NL*
fatal
fury
--
consequences
of
my
departure
--
which
might
now
,
perhaps
,
be
*NL*
dragging
him
from
the
path
of
right
,
too
far
to
leave
hope
of
ultimate
*NL*
restoration
thither
.
At
this
thought
,
I
turned
my
face
aside
from
the
*NL*
lovely
sky
of
eve
and
lonely
vale
of
Morton
--
I
say
_
lonely
_
,
for
in
that
*NL*
bend
of
it
visible
to
me
there
was
no
building
apparent
save
the
church
*NL*
and
the
parsonage
,
half-hid
in
trees
,
and
,
quite
at
the
extremity
,
the
*NL*
roof
of
Vale
Hall
,
where
the
rich
Mr.
Oliver
and
his
daughter
lived
.
I
*NL*
hid
my
eyes
,
and
leant
my
head
against
the
stone
frame
of
my
door
;
but
*NL*
soon
a
slight
noise
near
the
wicket
which
shut
in
my
tiny
garden
from
the
*NL*
meadow
beyond
it
made
me
look
up
.
A
dog
--
old
Carlo
,
Mr.
Rivers
'
pointer
,
*NL*
as
I
saw
in
a
moment
--
was
pushing
the
gate
with
his
nose
,
and
St.
John
*NL*
himself
leant
upon
it
with
folded
arms
;
his
brow
knit
,
his
gaze
,
grave
*NL*
almost
to
displeasure
,
fixed
on
me
.
I
asked
him
to
come
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
can
not
stay
;
I
have
only
brought
you
a
little
parcel
my
sisters
*NL*
left
for
you
.
I
think
it
contains
a
colour-box
,
pencils
,
and
paper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
approached
to
take
it
:
a
welcome
gift
it
was
.
He
examined
my
face
,
I
*NL*
thought
,
with
austerity
,
as
I
came
near
:
the
traces
of
tears
were
*NL*
doubtless
very
visible
upon
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
found
your
first
day
's
work
harder
than
you
expected
?
''
he
*NL*
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
!
On
the
contrary
,
I
think
in
time
I
shall
get
on
with
my
*NL*
scholars
very
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
perhaps
your
accommodations
--
your
cottage
--
your
furniture
--
have
*NL*
disappointed
your
expectations
?
They
are
,
in
truth
,
scanty
enough
;
but
--
''
*NL*
I
interrupted
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
cottage
is
clean
and
weather-proof
;
my
furniture
sufficient
and
*NL*
commodious
.
All
I
see
has
made
me
thankful
,
not
despondent
.
I
am
not
*NL*
absolutely
such
a
fool
and
sensualist
as
to
regret
the
absence
of
a
*NL*
carpet
,
a
sofa
,
and
silver
plate
;
besides
,
five
weeks
ago
I
had
nothing
--
I
*NL*
was
an
outcast
,
a
beggar
,
a
vagrant
;
now
I
have
acquaintance
,
a
home
,
a
*NL*
business
.
I
wonder
at
the
goodness
of
God
;
the
generosity
of
my
friends
;
*NL*
the
bounty
of
my
lot
.
I
do
not
repine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
feel
solitude
an
oppression
?
The
little
house
there
behind
you
*NL*
is
dark
and
empty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
hardly
had
time
yet
to
enjoy
a
sense
of
tranquillity
,
much
less
*NL*
to
grow
impatient
under
one
of
loneliness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
;
I
hope
you
feel
the
content
you
express
:
at
any
rate
,
your
*NL*
good
sense
will
tell
you
that
it
is
too
soon
yet
to
yield
to
the
*NL*
vacillating
fears
of
Lot
's
wife
.
What
you
had
left
before
I
saw
you
,
of
*NL*
course
I
do
not
know
;
but
I
counsel
you
to
resist
firmly
every
temptation
*NL*
which
would
incline
you
to
look
back
:
pursue
your
present
career
*NL*
steadily

for
some
months
at
least
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
what
I
mean
to
do
,
''
I
answered
.
St.
John
continued
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
hard
work
to
control
the
workings
of
inclination
and
turn
the
bent
*NL*
of
nature
;
but
that
it
may
be
done
,
I
know
from
experience
.
God
has
*NL*
given
us
,
in
a
measure
,
the
power
to
make
our
own
fate
;
and
when
our
*NL*
energies
seem
to
demand
a
sustenance
they
can
not
get
--
when
our
will
*NL*
strains
after
a
path
we
may
not
follow
--
we
need
neither
starve
from
*NL*
inanition
,
nor
stand
still
in
despair
:
we
have
but
to
seek
another
*NL*
nourishment
for
the
mind
,
as
strong
as
the
forbidden
food
it
longed
to
*NL*
taste
--
and
perhaps
purer
;
and
to
hew
out
for
the
adventurous
foot
a
road
*NL*
as
direct
and
broad
as
the
one
Fortune
has
blocked
up
against
us
,
if
*NL*
rougher
than
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
year
ago
I
was
myself
intensely
miserable
,
because
I
thought
I
had
*NL*
made
a
mistake
in
entering
the
ministry
:
its
uniform
duties
wearied
me
to
*NL*
death
.
I
burnt
for
the
more
active
life
of
the
world
--
for
the
more
*NL*
exciting
toils
of
a
literary
career
--
for
the
destiny
of
an
artist
,
*NL*
author
,
orator
;
anything
rather
than
that
of
a
priest
:
yes
,
the
heart
of
*NL*
a
politician
,
of
a
soldier
,
of
a
votary
of
glory
,
a
lover
of
renown
,
a
*NL*
luster
after
power
,
beat
under
my
curate
's
surplice
.
I
considered
;
my
*NL*
life
was
so
wretched
,
it
must
be
changed
,
or
I
must
die
.
After
a
season
*NL*
of
darkness
and
struggling
,
light
broke
and
relief
fell
:
my
cramped
*NL*
existence
all
at
once
spread
out
to
a
plain
without
bounds
--
my
powers
*NL*
heard
a
call
from
heaven
to
rise
,
gather
their
full
strength
,
spread
*NL*
their
wings
,
and
mount
beyond
ken
.
God
had
an
errand
for
me
;
to
bear
*NL*
which
afar
,
to
deliver
it
well
,
skill
and
strength
,
courage
and
*NL*
eloquence
,
the
best
qualifications
of
soldier
,
statesman
,
and
orator
,
*NL*
were
all
needed
:
for
these
all
centre
in
the
good
missionary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
missionary
I
resolved
to
be
.
From
that
moment
my
state
of
mind
*NL*
changed
;
the
fetters
dissolved
and
dropped
from
every
faculty
,
leaving
*NL*
nothing
of
bondage
but
its
galling
soreness
--
which
time
only
can
heal
.
My
*NL*
father
,
indeed
,
imposed
the
determination
,
but
since
his
death
,
I
have
*NL*
not
a
legitimate
obstacle
to
contend
with
;
some
affairs
settled
,
a
*NL*
successor
for
Morton
provided
,
an
entanglement
or
two
of
the
feelings
*NL*
broken
through
or
cut
asunder
--
a
last
conflict
with
human
weakness
,
in
*NL*
which
I
know
I
shall
overcome
,
because
I
have
vowed
that
I
_
will
_
*NL*
overcome
--
and
I
leave
Europe
for
the
East
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
this
,
in
his
peculiar
,
subdued
,
yet
emphatic
voice
;
looking
,
when
*NL*
he
had
ceased
speaking
,
not
at
me
,
but
at
the
setting
sun
,
at
which
I
*NL*
looked
too
.
Both
he
and
I
had
our
backs
towards
the
path
leading
up
the
*NL*
field
to
the
wicket
.
We
had
heard
no
step
on
that
grass-grown
track
;
the
*NL*
water
running
in
the
vale
was
the
one
lulling
sound
of
the
hour
and
*NL*
scene
;
we
might
well
then
start
when
a
gay
voice
,
sweet
as
a
silver
bell
,
*NL*
exclaimed
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
evening
,
Mr.
Rivers
.
And
good
evening
,
old
Carlo
.
Your
dog
is
*NL*
quicker
to
recognise
his
friends
than
you
are
,
sir
;
he
pricked
his
ears
*NL*
and
wagged
his
tail
when
I
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
field
,
and
you
have
*NL*
your
back
towards
me
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
true
.
Though
Mr.
Rivers
had
started
at
the
first
of
those
musical
*NL*
accents
,
as
if
a
thunderbolt
had
split
a
cloud
over
his
head
,
he
stood
*NL*
yet
,
at
the
close
of
the
sentence
,
in
the
same
attitude
in
which
the
*NL*
speaker
had
surprised
him
--
his
arm
resting
on
the
gate
,
his
face
directed
*NL*
towards
the
west
.
He
turned
at
last
,
with
measured
deliberation
.
A
*NL*
vision
,
as
it
seemed
to
me
,
had
risen
at
his
side
.
There
appeared
,
*NL*
within
three
feet
of
him
,
a
form
clad
in
pure
white
--
a
youthful
,
graceful
*NL*
form
:
full
,
yet
fine
in
contour
;
and
when
,
after
bending
to
caress
Carlo
,
*NL*
it
lifted
up
its
head
,
and
threw
back
a
long
veil
,
there
bloomed
under
*NL*
his
glance
a
face
of
perfect
beauty
.
Perfect
beauty
is
a
strong
*NL*
expression
;
but
I
do
not
retrace
or
qualify
it
:
as
sweet
features
as
ever
*NL*
the
temperate
clime
of
Albion
moulded
;
as
pure
hues
of
rose
and
lily
as
*NL*
ever
her
humid
gales
and
vapoury
skies
generated
and
screened
,
justified
,
*NL*
in
this
instance
,
the
term
.
No
charm
was
wanting
,
no
defect
was
*NL*
perceptible
;
the
young
girl
had
regular
and
delicate
lineaments
;
eyes
*NL*
shaped
and
coloured
as
we
see
them
in
lovely
pictures
,
large
,
and
dark
,
*NL*
and
full
;
the
long
and
shadowy
eyelash
which
encircles
a
fine
eye
with
so
*NL*
soft
a
fascination
;
the
pencilled
brow
which
gives
such
clearness
;
the
*NL*
white
smooth
forehead
,
which
adds
such
repose
to
the
livelier
beauties
of
*NL*
tint
and
ray
;
the
cheek
oval
,
fresh
,
and
smooth
;
the
lips
,
fresh
too
,
*NL*
ruddy
,
healthy
,
sweetly
formed
;
the
even
and
gleaming
teeth
without
flaw
;
*NL*
the
small
dimpled
chin
;
the
ornament
of
rich
,
plenteous
tresses
--
all
*NL*
advantages
,
in
short
,
which
,
combined
,
realise
the
ideal
of
beauty
,
were
*NL*
fully
hers
.
I
wondered
,
as
I
looked
at
this
fair
creature
:
I
admired
her
*NL*
with
my
whole
heart
.
Nature
had
surely
formed
her
in
a
partial
mood
;
*NL*
and
,
forgetting
her
usual
stinted
step-mother
dole
of
gifts
,
had
endowed
*NL*
this
,
her
darling
,
with
a
grand-dame
's
bounty
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
did
St.
John
Rivers
think
of
this
earthly
angel
?
I
naturally
asked
*NL*
myself
that
question
as
I
saw
him
turn
to
her
and
look
at
her
;
and
,
as
*NL*
naturally
,
I
sought
the
answer
to
the
inquiry
in
his
countenance
.
He
had
*NL*
already
withdrawn
his
eye
from
the
Peri
,
and
was
looking
at
a
humble
tuft
*NL*
of
daisies
which
grew
by
the
wicket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
lovely
evening
,
but
late
for
you
to
be
out
alone
,
''
he
said
,
as
he
*NL*
crushed
the
snowy
heads
of
the
closed
flowers
with
his
foot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
only
came
home
from
S
-
''
-LRB-
she
mentioned
the
name
of
a
large
town
*NL*
some
twenty
miles
distant
-RRB-
``
this
afternoon
.
Papa
told
me
you
had
opened
*NL*
your
school
,
and
that
the
new
mistress
was
come
;
and
so
I
put
on
my
*NL*
bonnet
after
tea
,
and
ran
up
the
valley
to
see
her
:
this
is
she
?
''
*NL*
pointing
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
,
''
said
St.
John
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
you
shall
like
Morton
?
''
she
asked
of
me
,
with
a
direct
and
*NL*
naive
simplicity
of
tone
and
manner
,
pleasing
,
if
child-like
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
I
shall
.
I
have
many
inducements
to
do
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
find
your
scholars
as
attentive
as
you
expected
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
like
your
house
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
I
furnished
it
nicely
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
nicely
,
indeed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
made
a
good
choice
of
an
attendant
for
you
in
Alice
Wood
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
indeed
.
She
is
teachable
and
handy
.
''
-LRB-
This
then
,
I
thought
,
*NL*
is
Miss
Oliver
,
the
heiress
;
favoured
,
it
seems
,
in
the
gifts
of
fortune
,
*NL*
as
well
as
in
those
of
nature
!
What
happy
combination
of
the
planets
*NL*
presided
over
her
birth
,
I
wonder
?
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
come
up
and
help
you
to
teach
sometimes
,
''
she
added
.
``
It
will
*NL*
be
a
change
for
me
to
visit
you
now
and
then
;
and
I
like
a
change

Mr.
*NL*
Rivers
,
I
have
been
_
so
_
gay
during
my
stay
at
S
-
.
Last
night
,
or
rather
*NL*
this
morning
,
I
was
dancing
till
two
o'clock
.
The
--
th
regiment
are
*NL*
stationed
there
since
the
riots
;
and
the
officers
are
the
most
agreeable
*NL*
men
in
the
world
:
they
put
all
our
young
knife-grinders
and
scissor
*NL*
merchants
to
shame
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
to
me
that
Mr.
St.
John
's
under
lip
protruded
,
and
his
upper
*NL*
lip
curled
a
moment
.
His
mouth
certainly
looked
a
good
deal
compressed
,
*NL*
and
the
lower
part
of
his
face
unusually
stern
and
square
,
as
the
*NL*
laughing
girl
gave
him
this
information
.
He
lifted
his
gaze
,
too
,
from
*NL*
the
daisies
,
and
turned
it
on
her
.
An
unsmiling
,
a
searching
,
a
meaning
*NL*
gaze
it
was
.
She
answered
it
with
a
second
laugh
,
and
laughter
well
*NL*
became
her
youth
,
her
roses
,
her
dimples
,
her
bright
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
stood
,
mute
and
grave
,
she
again
fell
to
caressing
Carlo
.
``
Poor
*NL*
Carlo
loves
me
,
''
said
she
.
''
_
He
_
is
not
stern
and
distant
to
his
*NL*
friends
;
and
if
he
could
speak
,
he
would
not
be
silent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
patted
the
dog
's
head
,
bending
with
native
grace
before
his
young
*NL*
and
austere
master
,
I
saw
a
glow
rise
to
that
master
's
face
.
I
saw
his
*NL*
solemn
eye
melt
with
sudden
fire
,
and
flicker
with
resistless
emotion
.
*NL*
Flushed
and
kindled
thus
,
he
looked
nearly
as
beautiful
for
a
man
as
she
*NL*
for
a
woman
.
His
chest
heaved
once
,
as
if
his
large
heart
,
weary
of
*NL*
despotic
constriction
,
had
expanded
,
despite
the
will
,
and
made
a
*NL*
vigorous
bound
for
the
attainment
of
liberty
.
But
he
curbed
it
,
I
think
,
*NL*
as
a
resolute
rider
would
curb
a
rearing
steed
.
He
responded
neither
by
*NL*
word
nor
movement
to
the
gentle
advances
made
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Papa
says
you
never
come
to
see
us
now
,
''
continued
Miss
Oliver
,
looking
*NL*
up
.
``
You
are
quite
a
stranger
at
Vale
Hall
.
He
is
alone
this
evening
,
*NL*
and
not
very
well
:
will
you
return
with
me
and
visit
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
a
seasonable
hour
to
intrude
on
Mr.
Oliver
,
''
answered
St.
*NL*
John
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
seasonable
hour
!
But
I
declare
it
is
.
It
is
just
the
hour
when
*NL*
papa
most
wants
company
:
when
the
works
are
closed
and
he
has
no
business
*NL*
to
occupy
him
.
Now
,
Mr.
Rivers
,
_
do
_
come
.
Why
are
you
so
very
shy
,
and
*NL*
so
very
sombre
?
''
She
filled
up
the
hiatus
his
silence
left
by
a
reply
of
*NL*
her
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
forgot
!
''
she
exclaimed
,
shaking
her
beautiful
curled
head
,
as
if
*NL*
shocked
at
herself
.
``
I
am
so
giddy
and
thoughtless
!
_
Do
_
excuse
me
.
It
*NL*
had
slipped
my
memory
that
you
have
good
reasons
to
be
indisposed
for
*NL*
joining
in
my
chatter
.
Diana
and
Mary
have
left
you
,
and
Moor
House
is
*NL*
shut
up
,
and
you
are
so
lonely
.
I
am
sure
I
pity
you
.
Do
come
and
see
*NL*
papa
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
to-night
,
Miss
Rosamond
,
not
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
St.
John
spoke
almost
like
an
automaton
:
himself
only
knew
the
effort
*NL*
it
cost
him
thus
to
refuse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
if
you
are
so
obstinate
,
I
will
leave
you
;
for
I
dare
not
stay
any
*NL*
longer
:
the
dew
begins
to
fall
.
Good
evening
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
held
out
her
hand
.
He
just
touched
it
.
``
Good
evening
!
''
he
repeated
,
*NL*
in
a
voice
low
and
hollow
as
an
echo
.
She
turned
,
but
in
a
moment
*NL*
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
well
?
''
she
asked
.
Well
might
she
put
the
question
:
his
face
was
*NL*
blanched
as
her
gown
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
well
,
''
he
enunciated
;
and
,
with
a
bow
,
he
left
the
gate
.
She
went
*NL*
one
way
;
he
another
.
She
turned
twice
to
gaze
after
him
as
she
tripped
*NL*
fairy-like
down
the
field
;
he
,
as
he
strode
firmly
across
,
never
turned
*NL*
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
spectacle
of
another
's
suffering
and
sacrifice
rapt
my
thoughts
from
*NL*
exclusive
meditation
on
my
own
.
Diana
Rivers
had
designated
her
brother
*NL*
``
inexorable
as
death

She
had
not
exaggerated

CHAPTER
XXXII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
continued
the
labours
of
the
village-school
as
actively
and
faithfully
*NL*
as
I
could
.
It
was
truly
hard
work
at
first
.
Some
time
elapsed
before
,
*NL*
with
all
my
efforts
,
I
could
comprehend
my
scholars
and
their
nature
.
*NL*
Wholly
untaught
,
with
faculties
quite
torpid
,
they
seemed
to
me
*NL*
hopelessly
dull
;
and
,
at
first
sight
,
all
dull
alike
:
but
I
soon
found
I
*NL*
was
mistaken
.
There
was
a
difference
amongst
them
as
amongst
the
*NL*
educated
;
and
when
I
got
to
know
them
,
and
they
me
,
this
difference
*NL*
rapidly
developed
itself
.
Their
amazement
at
me
,
my
language
,
my
rules
,
*NL*
and
ways
,
once
subsided
,
I
found
some
of
these
heavy-looking
,
gaping
*NL*
rustics
wake
up
into
sharp-witted
girls
enough
.
Many
showed
themselves
*NL*
obliging
,
and
amiable
too
;
and
I
discovered
amongst
them
not
a
few
*NL*
examples
of
natural
politeness
,
and
innate
self-respect
,
as
well
as
of
*NL*
excellent
capacity
,
that
won
both
my
goodwill
and
my
admiration
.
These
*NL*
soon
took
a
pleasure
in
doing
their
work
well
,
in
keeping
their
persons
*NL*
neat
,
in
learning
their
tasks
regularly
,
in
acquiring
quiet
and
orderly
*NL*
manners
.
The
rapidity
of
their
progress
,
in
some
instances
,
was
even
*NL*
surprising
;
and
an
honest
and
happy
pride
I
took
in
it
:
besides
,
I
began
*NL*
personally
to
like
some
of
the
best
girls
;
and
they
liked
me
.
I
had
*NL*
amongst
my
scholars
several
farmers
'
daughters
:
young
women
grown
,
*NL*
almost
.
These
could
already
read
,
write
,
and
sew
;
and
to
them
I
taught
*NL*
the
elements
of
grammar
,
geography
,
history
,
and
the
finer
kinds
of
*NL*
needlework
.
I
found
estimable
characters
amongst
them
--
characters
*NL*
desirous
of
information
and
disposed
for
improvement
--
with
whom
I
passed
*NL*
many
a
pleasant
evening
hour
in
their
own
homes
.
Their
parents
then
-LRB-
the
*NL*
farmer
and
his
wife
-RRB-
loaded
me
with
attentions
.
There
was
an
enjoyment
*NL*
in
accepting
their
simple
kindness
,
and
in
repaying
it
by
a
*NL*
consideration
--
a
scrupulous
regard
to
their
feelings
--
to
which
they
were
*NL*
not
,
perhaps
,
at
all
times
accustomed
,
and
which
both
charmed
and
*NL*
benefited
them
;
because
,
while
it
elevated
them
in
their
own
eyes
,
it
*NL*
made
them
emulous
to
merit
the
deferential
treatment
they
received
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
I
became
a
favourite
in
the
neighbourhood
.
Whenever
I
went
out
,
I
*NL*
heard
on
all
sides
cordial
salutations
,
and
was
welcomed
with
friendly
*NL*
smiles
.
To
live
amidst
general
regard
,
though
it
be
but
the
regard
of
*NL*
working
people
,
is
like
``
sitting
in
sunshine
,
calm
and
sweet
;
''
serene
*NL*
inward
feelings
bud
and
bloom
under
the
ray
.
At
this
period
of
my
life
,
*NL*
my
heart
far
oftener
swelled
with
thankfulness
than
sank
with
dejection
:
*NL*
and
yet
,
reader
,
to
tell
you
all
,
in
the
midst
of
this
calm
,
this
useful
*NL*
existence
--
after
a
day
passed
in
honourable
exertion
amongst
my
scholars
,
*NL*
an
evening
spent
in
drawing
or
reading
contentedly
alone
--
I
used
to
rush
*NL*
into
strange
dreams
at
night
:
dreams
many-coloured
,
agitated
,
full
of
the
*NL*
ideal
,
the
stirring
,
the
stormy
--
dreams
where
,
amidst
unusual
scenes
,
*NL*
charged
with
adventure
,
with
agitating
risk
and
romantic
chance
,
I
still
*NL*
again
and
again
met
Mr.
Rochester
,
always
at
some
exciting
crisis
;
and
*NL*
then
the
sense
of
being
in
his
arms
,
hearing
his
voice
,
meeting
his
eye
,
*NL*
touching
his
hand
and
cheek
,
loving
him
,
being
loved
by
him
--
the
hope
of
*NL*
passing
a
lifetime
at
his
side
,
would
be
renewed
,
with
all
its
first
*NL*
force
and
fire
.
Then
I
awoke
.
Then
I
recalled
where
I
was
,
and
how
*NL*
situated
.
Then
I
rose
up
on
my
curtainless
bed
,
trembling
and
quivering
;
*NL*
and
then
the
still
,
dark
night
witnessed
the
convulsion
of
despair
,
and
*NL*
heard
the
burst
of
passion
.
By
nine
o'clock
the
next
morning
I
was
*NL*
punctually
opening
the
school
;
tranquil
,
settled
,
prepared
for
the
steady
*NL*
duties
of
the
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rosamond
Oliver
kept
her
word
in
coming
to
visit
me
.
Her
call
at
the
*NL*
school
was
generally
made
in
the
course
of
her
morning
ride
.
She
would
*NL*
canter
up
to
the
door
on
her
pony
,
followed
by
a
mounted
livery
servant
.
*NL*
Anything
more
exquisite
than
her
appearance
,
in
her
purple
habit
,
with
*NL*
her
Amazon
's
cap
of
black
velvet
placed
gracefully
above
the
long
curls
*NL*
that
kissed
her
cheek
and
floated
to
her
shoulders
,
can
scarcely
be
*NL*
imagined
:
and
it
was
thus
she
would
enter
the
rustic
building
,
and
glide
*NL*
through
the
dazzled
ranks
of
the
village
children
.
She
generally
came
at
*NL*
the
hour
when
Mr.
Rivers
was
engaged
in
giving
his
daily
catechising
*NL*
lesson
.
Keenly
,
I
fear
,
did
the
eye
of
the
visitress
pierce
the
young
*NL*
pastor
's
heart
.
A
sort
of
instinct
seemed
to
warn
him
of
her
entrance
,
*NL*
even
when
he
did
not
see
it
;
and
when
he
was
looking
quite
away
from
the
*NL*
door
,
if
she
appeared
at
it
,
his
cheek
would
glow
,
and
his
marble-seeming
*NL*
features
,
though
they
refused
to
relax
,
changed
indescribably
,
and
in
*NL*
their
very
quiescence
became
expressive
of
a
repressed
fervour
,
stronger
*NL*
than
working
muscle
or
darting
glance
could
indicate
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
,
she
knew
her
power
:
indeed
,
he
did
not
,
because
he
could
not
,
*NL*
conceal
it
from
her
.
In
spite
of
his
Christian
stoicism
,
when
she
went
*NL*
up
and
addressed
him
,
and
smiled
gaily
,
encouragingly
,
even
fondly
in
his
*NL*
face
,
his
hand
would
tremble
and
his
eye
burn
.
He
seemed
to
say
,
with
*NL*
his
sad
and
resolute
look
,
if
he
did
not
say
it
with
his
lips
,
``
I
love
*NL*
you
,
and
I
know
you
prefer
me
.
It
is
not
despair
of
success
that
keeps
*NL*
me
dumb
.
If
I
offered
my
heart
,
I
believe
you
would
accept
it
.
But
that
*NL*
heart
is
already
laid
on
a
sacred
altar
:
the
fire
is
arranged
round
it
.
*NL*
It
will
soon
be
no
more
than
a
sacrifice
consumed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
she
would
pout
like
a
disappointed
child
;
a
pensive
cloud
would
*NL*
soften
her
radiant
vivacity
;
she
would
withdraw
her
hand
hastily
from
*NL*
his
,
and
turn
in
transient
petulance
from
his
aspect
,
at
once
so
heroic
*NL*
and
so
martyr-like
.
St.
John
,
no
doubt
,
would
have
given
the
world
to
*NL*
follow
,
recall
,
retain
her
,
when
she
thus
left
him
;
but
he
would
not
give
*NL*
one
chance
of
heaven
,
nor
relinquish
,
for
the
elysium
of
her
love
,
one
*NL*
hope
of
the
true
,
eternal
Paradise
.
Besides
,
he
could
not
bind
all
that
*NL*
he
had
in
his
nature
--
the
rover
,
the
aspirant
,
the
poet
,
the
priest
--
in
*NL*
the
limits
of
a
single
passion
.
He
could
not
--
he
would
not
--
renounce
his
*NL*
wild
field
of
mission
warfare
for
the
parlours
and
the
peace
of
Vale
*NL*
Hall
.
I
learnt
so
much
from
himself
in
an
inroad
I
once
,
despite
his
*NL*
reserve
,
had
the
daring
to
make
on
his
confidence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Oliver
already
honoured
me
with
frequent
visits
to
my
cottage
.
I
*NL*
had
learnt
her
whole
character
,
which
was
without
mystery
or
disguise
:
*NL*
she
was
coquettish
but
not
heartless
;
exacting
,
but
not
worthlessly
*NL*
selfish
.
She
had
been
indulged
from
her
birth
,
but
was
not
absolutely
*NL*
spoilt
.
She
was
hasty
,
but
good-humoured
;
vain
-LRB-
she
could
not
help
it
,
*NL*
when
every
glance
in
the
glass
showed
her
such
a
flush
of
loveliness
-RRB-
,
*NL*
but
not
affected
;
liberal-handed
;
innocent
of
the
pride
of
wealth
;
*NL*
ingenuous
;
sufficiently
intelligent
;
gay
,
lively
,
and
unthinking
:
she
was
*NL*
very
charming
,
in
short
,
even
to
a
cool
observer
of
her
own
sex
like
me
;
*NL*
but
she
was
not
profoundly
interesting
or
thoroughly
impressive
.
A
very
*NL*
different
sort
of
mind
was
hers
from
that
,
for
instance
,
of
the
sisters
*NL*
of
St.
John
.
Still
,
I
liked
her
almost
as
I
liked
my
pupil
Adele
;
except
*NL*
that
,
for
a
child
whom
we
have
watched
over
and
taught
,
a
closer
*NL*
affection
is
engendered
than
we
can
give
an
equally
attractive
adult
*NL*
acquaintance
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
taken
an
amiable
caprice
to
me
.
She
said
I
was
like
Mr.
Rivers
,
*NL*
only
,
certainly
,
she
allowed
,
``
not
one-tenth
so
handsome
,
though
I
was
a
*NL*
nice
neat
little
soul
enough
,
but
he
was
an
angel
.
''
I
was
,
however
,
*NL*
good
,
clever
,
composed
,
and
firm
,
like
him
.
I
was
a
_
lusus
naturae
_
,
she
*NL*
affirmed
,
as
a
village
schoolmistress
:
she
was
sure
my
previous
history
,
*NL*
if
known
,
would
make
a
delightful
romance
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
,
while
,
with
her
usual
child-like
activity
,
and
thoughtless
*NL*
yet
not
offensive
inquisitiveness
,
she
was
rummaging
the
cupboard
and
the
*NL*
table-drawer
of
my
little
kitchen
,
she
discovered
first
two
French
books
,
*NL*
a
volume
of
Schiller
,
a
German
grammar
and
dictionary
,
and
then
my
*NL*
drawing-materials
and
some
sketches
,
including
a
pencil-head
of
a
pretty
*NL*
little
cherub-like
girl
,
one
of
my
scholars
,
and
sundry
views
from
*NL*
nature
,
taken
in
the
Vale
of
Morton
and
on
the
surrounding
moors
.
She
*NL*
was
first
transfixed
with
surprise
,
and
then
electrified
with
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Had
I
done
these
pictures
?
Did
I
know
French
and
German
?
What
a
*NL*
love
--
what
a
miracle
I
was
!
I
drew
better
than
her
master
in
the
first
*NL*
school
in
S
-
.
Would
I
sketch
a
portrait
of
her
,
to
show
to
papa
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
pleasure
,
''
I
replied
;
and
I
felt
a
thrill
of
artist-delight
at
the
*NL*
idea
of
copying
from
so
perfect
and
radiant
a
model
.
She
had
then
on
a
*NL*
dark-blue
silk
dress
;
her
arms
and
her
neck
were
bare
;
her
only
ornament
*NL*
was
her
chestnut
tresses
,
which
waved
over
her
shoulders
with
all
the
*NL*
wild
grace
of
natural
curls
.
I
took
a
sheet
of
fine
card-board
,
and
drew
*NL*
a
careful
outline
.
I
promised
myself
the
pleasure
of
colouring
it
;
and
,
*NL*
as
it
was
getting
late
then
,
I
told
her
she
must
come
and
sit
another
*NL*
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
made
such
a
report
of
me
to
her
father
,
that
Mr.
Oliver
himself
*NL*
accompanied
her
next
evening
--
a
tall
,
massive-featured
,
middle-aged
,
and
*NL*
grey-headed
man
,
at
whose
side
his
lovely
daughter
looked
like
a
bright
*NL*
flower
near
a
hoary
turret
.
He
appeared
a
taciturn
,
and
perhaps
a
proud
*NL*
personage
;
but
he
was
very
kind
to
me
.
The
sketch
of
Rosamond
's
portrait
*NL*
pleased
him
highly
:
he
said
I
must
make
a
finished
picture
of
it
.
He
*NL*
insisted
,
too
,
on
my
coming
the
next
day
to
spend
the
evening
at
Vale
*NL*
Hall
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
.
I
found
it
a
large
,
handsome
residence
,
showing
abundant
*NL*
evidences
of
wealth
in
the
proprietor
.
Rosamond
was
full
of
glee
and
*NL*
pleasure
all
the
time
I
stayed
.
Her
father
was
affable
;
and
when
he
*NL*
entered
into
conversation
with
me
after
tea
,
he
expressed
in
strong
terms
*NL*
his
approbation
of
what
I
had
done
in
Morton
school
,
and
said
he
only
*NL*
feared
,
from
what
he
saw
and
heard
,
I
was
too
good
for
the
place
,
and
*NL*
would
soon
quit
it
for
one
more
suitable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
''
cried
Rosamond
,
``
she
is
clever
enough
to
be
a
governess
in
a
*NL*
high
family
,
papa
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
I
would
far
rather
be
where
I
am
than
in
any
high
family
in
the
*NL*
land
.
Mr.
Oliver
spoke
of
Mr.
Rivers
--
of
the
Rivers
family
--
with
great
*NL*
respect
.
He
said
it
was
a
very
old
name
in
that
neighbourhood
;
that
the
*NL*
ancestors
of
the
house
were
wealthy
;
that
all
Morton
had
once
belonged
to
*NL*
them
;
that
even
now
he
considered
the
representative
of
that
house
might
,
*NL*
if
he
liked
,
make
an
alliance
with
the
best
.
He
accounted
it
a
pity
that
*NL*
so
fine
and
talented
a
young
man
should
have
formed
the
design
of
going
*NL*
out
as
a
missionary
;
it
was
quite
throwing
a
valuable
life
away
.
It
*NL*
appeared
,
then
,
that
her
father
would
throw
no
obstacle
in
the
way
of
*NL*
Rosamond
's
union
with
St.
John
.
Mr.
Oliver
evidently
regarded
the
young
*NL*
clergyman
's
good
birth
,
old
name
,
and
sacred
profession
as
sufficient
*NL*
compensation
for
the
want
of
fortune
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
5th
of
November
,
and
a
holiday
.
My
little
servant
,
after
*NL*
helping
me
to
clean
my
house
,
was
gone
,
well
satisfied
with
the
fee
of
a
*NL*
penny
for
her
aid
.
All
about
me
was
spotless
and
bright
--
scoured
floor
,
*NL*
polished
grate
,
and
well-rubbed
chairs
.
I
had
also
made
myself
neat
,
and
*NL*
had
now
the
afternoon
before
me
to
spend
as
I
would
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
translation
of
a
few
pages
of
German
occupied
an
hour
;
then
I
got
my
*NL*
palette
and
pencils
,
and
fell
to
the
more
soothing
,
because
easier
*NL*
occupation
,
of
completing
Rosamond
Oliver
's
miniature
.
The
head
was
*NL*
finished
already
:
there
was
but
the
background
to
tint
and
the
drapery
to
*NL*
shade
off
;
a
touch
of
carmine
,
too
,
to
add
to
the
ripe
lips
--
a
soft
curl
*NL*
here
and
there
to
the
tresses
--
a
deeper
tinge
to
the
shadow
of
the
lash
*NL*
under
the
azured
eyelid
.
I
was
absorbed
in
the
execution
of
these
nice
*NL*
details
,
when
,
after
one
rapid
tap
,
my
door
unclosed
,
admitting
St.
John
*NL*
Rivers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
come
to
see
how
you
are
spending
your
holiday
,
''
he
said
.
``
Not
,
I
*NL*
hope
,
in
thought
?
No
,
that
is
well
:
while
you
draw
you
will
not
feel
*NL*
lonely
.
You
see
,
I
mistrust
you
still
,
though
you
have
borne
up
*NL*
wonderfully
so
far
.
I
have
brought
you
a
book
for
evening
solace
,
''
and
*NL*
he
laid
on
the
table
a
new
publication
--
a
poem
:
one
of
those
genuine
*NL*
productions
so
often
vouchsafed
to
the
fortunate
public
of
those
days
--
the
*NL*
golden
age
of
modern
literature
.
Alas
!
the
readers
of
our
era
are
less
*NL*
favoured
.
But
courage
!
I
will
not
pause
either
to
accuse
or
repine
.
I
*NL*
know
poetry
is
not
dead
,
nor
genius
lost
;
nor
has
Mammon
gained
power
*NL*
over
either
,
to
bind
or
slay
:
they
will
both
assert
their
existence
,
*NL*
their
presence
,
their
liberty
and
strength
again
one
day
.
Powerful
*NL*
angels
,
safe
in
heaven
!
they
smile
when
sordid
souls
triumph
,
and
feeble
*NL*
ones
weep
over
their
destruction
.
Poetry
destroyed
?
Genius
banished
?
*NL*
No
!
Mediocrity
,
no
:
do
not
let
envy
prompt
you
to
the
thought
.
No
;
they
*NL*
not
only
live
,
but
reign
and
redeem
:
and
without
their
divine
influence
*NL*
spread
everywhere
,
you
would
be
in
hell
--
the
hell
of
your
own
meanness
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
I
was
eagerly
glancing
at
the
bright
pages
of
``
Marmion
''
-LRB-
for
*NL*
``
Marmion
''
it
was
-RRB-
,
St.
John
stooped
to
examine
my
drawing
.
His
tall
*NL*
figure
sprang
erect
again
with
a
start
:
he
said
nothing
.
I
looked
up
at
*NL*
him
:
he
shunned
my
eye
.
I
knew
his
thoughts
well
,
and
could
read
his
*NL*
heart
plainly
;
at
the
moment
I
felt
calmer
and
cooler
than
he
:
I
had
then
*NL*
temporarily
the
advantage
of
him
,
and
I
conceived
an
inclination
to
do
*NL*
him
some
good
,
if
I
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
all
his
firmness
and
self-control
,
''
thought
I
,
``
he
tasks
himself
*NL*
too
far
:
locks
every
feeling
and
pang
within
--
expresses
,
confesses
,
*NL*
imparts
nothing
.
I
am
sure
it
would
benefit
him
to
talk
a
little
about
*NL*
this
sweet
Rosamond
,
whom
he
thinks
he
ought
not
to
marry
:
I
will
make
*NL*
him
talk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
first
,
``
Take
a
chair
,
Mr.
Rivers
.
''
But
he
answered
,
as
he
always
*NL*
did
,
that
he
could
not
stay
.
``
Very
well
,
''
I
responded
,
mentally
,
``
stand
*NL*
if
you
like
;
but
you
shall
not
go
just
yet
,
I
am
determined
:
solitude
is
*NL*
at
least
as
bad
for
you
as
it
is
for
me
.
I
'll
try
if
I
can
not
discover
*NL*
the
secret
spring
of
your
confidence
,
and
find
an
aperture
in
that
marble
*NL*
breast
through
which
I
can
shed
one
drop
of
the
balm
of
sympathy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
this
portrait
like
?
''
I
asked
bluntly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
!
Like
whom
?
I
did
not
observe
it
closely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
,
Mr.
Rivers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
almost
started
at
my
sudden
and
strange
abruptness
:
he
looked
at
me
*NL*
astonished
.
``
Oh
,
that
is
nothing
yet
,
''
I
muttered
within
.
``
I
do
n't
mean
*NL*
to
be
baffled
by
a
little
stiffness
on
your
part
;
I
'm
prepared
to
go
to
*NL*
considerable
lengths
.
''
I
continued
,
``
You
observed
it
closely
and
*NL*
distinctly
;
but
I
have
no
objection
to
your
looking
at
it
again
,
''
and
I
*NL*
rose
and
placed
it
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
well-executed
picture
,
''
he
said
;
``
very
soft
,
clear
colouring
;
very
*NL*
graceful
and
correct
drawing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
;
I
know
all
that
.
But
what
of
the
resemblance
?
Who
is
it
*NL*
like
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mastering
some
hesitation
,
he
answered
,
``
Miss
Oliver
,
I
presume
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
.
And
now
,
sir
,
to
reward
you
for
the
accurate
guess
,
I
will
*NL*
promise
to
paint
you
a
careful
and
faithful
duplicate
of
this
very
*NL*
picture
,
provided
you
admit
that
the
gift
would
be
acceptable
to
you
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
wish
to
throw
away
my
time
and
trouble
on
an
offering
you
would
*NL*
deem
worthless
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
continued
to
gaze
at
the
picture
:
the
longer
he
looked
,
the
firmer
he
*NL*
held
it
,
the
more
he
seemed
to
covet
it
.
``
It
is
like
!
''
he
murmured
;
``
the
*NL*
eye
is
well
managed
:
the
colour
,
light
,
expression
,
are
perfect
.
It
*NL*
smiles
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
it
comfort
,
or
would
it
wound
you
to
have
a
similar
painting
?
Tell
*NL*
me
that
.
When
you
are
at
Madagascar
,
or
at
the
Cape
,
or
in
India
,
would
*NL*
it
be
a
consolation
to
have
that
memento
in
your
possession
?
or
would
the
*NL*
sight
of
it
bring
recollections
calculated
to
enervate
and
distress
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
now
furtively
raised
his
eyes
:
he
glanced
at
me
,
irresolute
,
*NL*
disturbed
:
he
again
surveyed
the
picture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
should
like
to
have
it
is
certain
:
whether
it
would
be
judicious
*NL*
or
wise
is
another
question
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Since
I
had
ascertained
that
Rosamond
really
preferred
him
,
and
that
her
*NL*
father
was
not
likely
to
oppose
the
match
,
I
--
less
exalted
in
my
views
*NL*
than
St.
John
--
had
been
strongly
disposed
in
my
own
heart
to
advocate
*NL*
their
union
.
It
seemed
to
me
that
,
should
he
become
the
possessor
of
Mr.
*NL*
Oliver
's
large
fortune
,
he
might
do
as
much
good
with
it
as
if
he
went
*NL*
and
laid
his
genius
out
to
wither
,
and
his
strength
to
waste
,
under
a
*NL*
tropical
sun
.
With
this
persuasion
I
now
answered
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
far
as
I
can
see
,
it
would
be
wiser
and
more
judicious
if
you
were
to
*NL*
take
to
yourself
the
original
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
he
had
sat
down
:
he
had
laid
the
picture
on
the
table
before
*NL*
him
,
and
with
his
brow
supported
on
both
hands
,
hung
fondly
over
it
.
I
*NL*
discerned
he
was
now
neither
angry
nor
shocked
at
my
audacity
.
I
saw
*NL*
even
that
to
be
thus
frankly
addressed
on
a
subject
he
had
deemed
*NL*
unapproachable
--
to
hear
it
thus
freely
handled
--
was
beginning
to
be
felt
*NL*
by
him
as
a
new
pleasure
--
an
unhoped-for
relief
.
Reserved
people
often
*NL*
really
need
the
frank
discussion
of
their
sentiments
and
griefs
more
than
*NL*
the
expansive
.
The
sternest-seeming
stoic
is
human
after
all
;
and
to
*NL*
``
burst
''
with
boldness
and
good-will
into
``
the
silent
sea
''
of
their
souls
*NL*
is
often
to
confer
on
them
the
first
of
obligations
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
likes
you
,
I
am
sure
,
''
said
I
,
as
I
stood
behind
his
chair
,
``
and
her
*NL*
father
respects
you
.
Moreover
,
she
is
a
sweet
girl
--
rather
thoughtless
;
*NL*
but
you
would
have
sufficient
thought
for
both
yourself
and
her
.
You
*NL*
ought
to
marry
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Does
_
she
like
me
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
;
better
than
she
likes
any
one
else
.
She
talks
of
you
*NL*
continually
:
there
is
no
subject
she
enjoys
so
much
or
touches
upon
so
*NL*
often
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
very
pleasant
to
hear
this
,
''
he
said
--
``
very
:
go
on
for
another
*NL*
quarter
of
an
hour
.
''
And
he
actually
took
out
his
watch
and
laid
it
upon
*NL*
the
table
to
measure
the
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
where
is
the
use
of
going
on
,
''
I
asked
,
``
when
you
are
probably
*NL*
preparing
some
iron
blow
of
contradiction
,
or
forging
a
fresh
chain
to
*NL*
fetter
your
heart
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
imagine
such
hard
things
.
Fancy
me
yielding
and
melting
,
as
I
am
*NL*
doing
:
human
love
rising
like
a
freshly
opened
fountain
in
my
mind
and
*NL*
overflowing
with
sweet
inundation
all
the
field
I
have
so
carefully
and
*NL*
with
such
labour
prepared
--
so
assiduously
sown
with
the
seeds
of
good
*NL*
intentions
,
of
self-denying
plans
.
And
now
it
is
deluged
with
a
*NL*
nectarous
flood
--
the
young
germs
swamped
--
delicious
poison
cankering
*NL*
them
:
now
I
see
myself
stretched
on
an
ottoman
in
the
drawing-room
at
*NL*
Vale
Hall
at
my
bride
Rosamond
Oliver
's
feet
:
she
is
talking
to
me
with
*NL*
her
sweet
voice
--
gazing
down
on
me
with
those
eyes
your
skilful
hand
has
*NL*
copied
so
well
--
smiling
at
me
with
these
coral
lips
.
She
is
mine
--
I
am
*NL*
hers
--
this
present
life
and
passing
world
suffice
to
me
.
Hush
!
say
*NL*
nothing

my
heart
is
full
of
delight

my
senses
are
entranced
--
let
the
*NL*
time
I
marked
pass
in
peace
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
humoured
him
:
the
watch
ticked
on
:
he
breathed
fast
and
low
:
I
stood
*NL*
silent
.
Amidst
this
hush
the
quartet
sped
;
he
replaced
the
watch
,
laid
*NL*
the
picture
down
,
rose
,
and
stood
on
the
hearth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
he
,
``
that
little
space
was
given
to
delirium
and
delusion

I
*NL*
rested
my
temples
on
the
breast
of
temptation
,
and
put
my
neck
*NL*
voluntarily
under
her
yoke
of
flowers
.
I
tasted
her
cup
.
The
pillow
was
*NL*
burning
:
there
is
an
asp
in
the
garland
:
the
wine
has
a
bitter
taste
:
her
*NL*
promises
are
hollow
--
her
offers
false

I
see

all
this

*NL*
*NL*
I
gazed
at
him
in
wonder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
strange

pursued
he
,
``

wildly

exquisitely
beautiful

I
experience

*NL*
*NL*
``
Strange

I
could
not

ejaculating

*NL*
``
While

he
went
on

aspired
to

co-operate
in

undertook

Rosamond
a

a

a
female
apostle

a

No

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
need
not
be

You
might
relinquish

*NL*
*NL*
``

What

my

in
heaven

My

being
numbered
in

have
merged
all

in
the
glorious

It

dearer

It

what
I
have
to
look
forward
to
,

to

live
for

''
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
considerable
pause
,
I
said
--
``
And
Miss
Oliver
?
Are
her
*NL*
disappointment
and
sorrow
of
no
interest

``
Miss

ever

month

my

be
effaced
from
her
heart

She
will
forget
me
;
and
*NL*
will
marry
,
probably
,
some
one
who
will
make
her
far
happier
than
I

should
do

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
speak
coolly
enough

you
suffer
in

conflict

You

wasting
away

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

If
I
get
a
little
thin
,
it
is
with
anxiety
about
my
prospects
,
yet
*NL*
unsettled
--
my
departure
,
continually
procrastinated
.
Only
this
morning
,
*NL*
I
received
intelligence
that
the
successor

whose
arrival
I
have
been
so
*NL*
long
expecting

can
not
be

perhaps
the
three
months
may
extend
to
six

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
tremble
and
become
flushed
whenever
Miss
Oliver
enters
the
*NL*
schoolroom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
the
surprised
expression
crossed
his
face
.
He
had
not
imagined
*NL*
that
a
woman
would
dare
to
speak
so
to
a
man
.
For
me
,
I
felt
at
home
in
*NL*
this
sort
of
discourse
.
I
could
never
rest
in
communication
with
strong
,
*NL*
discreet
,
and
refined
minds
,
whether
male
or
female
,
till
I
had
passed
*NL*
the
outworks
of
conventional
reserve
,
and
crossed
the
threshold
of
*NL*
confidence
,
and
won
a
place
by
their
heart
's
very
hearthstone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
original
,
''
said
he
,
``
and
not
timid
.
There
is
something
brave
in
*NL*
your
spirit

as
well
as
penetrating
in
your
eye
;
but
allow
me
to
assure
*NL*
you
that
you
partially
misinterpret
my
emotions
.
You
think
them
more
*NL*
profound
and
potent
than
they
are
.
You
give
me
a
larger
allowance
of
*NL*
sympathy
than
I
have
a
just
claim
to
.
When
I
colour
,
and
when
I
shade
*NL*
before
Miss
Oliver
,
I
do
not
pity
myself

I
scorn
the
weakness
.
I
know
*NL*
it
is
ignoble
:
a
mere
fever
of
the
flesh
:
not
,
I
declare
,
the
convulsion
*NL*
of
the
soul
.
_
That
_
is
just
as
fixed
as
a
rock
,
firm
set
in
the
depths
*NL*
of
a
restless
sea
.
Know
me
to
be
what
I
am
--
a
cold
hard
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
smiled
incredulously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
taken
my
confidence
by
storm
,
''
he
continued
,
``
and
now
it
is
*NL*
much
at
your
service
.
I
am
simply
,
in
my
original
state
--
stripped
of
*NL*
that
blood-bleached
robe
with
which
Christianity
covers
human
deformity
--
a
*NL*
cold
,
hard
,
ambitious
man
.
Natural
affection
only
,
of
all
the
*NL*
sentiments
,
has
permanent
power
over
me
.
Reason
,
and
not
feeling
,
is
my
*NL*
guide
;
my
ambition
is
unlimited
:
my
desire
to
rise
higher
,
to
do
more
*NL*
than
others
,
insatiable
.
I
honour
endurance
,
perseverance
,
industry
,
*NL*
talent
;
because
these
are
the
means
by
which
men
achieve
great
ends
and
*NL*
mount
to
lofty
eminence
.
I
watch
your
career
with
interest
,
because
I
*NL*
consider
you
a
specimen
of
a
diligent
,
orderly
,
energetic
woman
:
not
*NL*
because
I
deeply
compassionate
what
you
have
gone
through
,
or
what
you
*NL*
still
suffer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
describe
yourself
as
a
mere
pagan
philosopher
,
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
There
is
this
difference
between
me
and
deistic
philosophers
:
I
*NL*
believe
;
and
I
believe
the
Gospel
.
You
missed
your
epithet
.
I
am
not
a
*NL*
pagan
,
but
a
Christian
philosopher
--
a
follower
of
the
sect
of
Jesus
.
As
*NL*
His
disciple
I
adopt
His
pure
,
His
merciful
,
His
benignant
doctrines
.
I
*NL*
advocate
them
:
I
am
sworn
to
spread
them
.
Won
in
youth
to
religion
,
she
*NL*
has
cultivated
my
original
qualities
thus
:
--
From
the
minute
germ
,
natural
*NL*
affection
,
she
has
developed
the
overshadowing
tree
,
philanthropy
.
From
*NL*
the
wild
stringy
root
of
human
uprightness
,
she
has
reared
a
due
sense
of
*NL*
the
Divine
justice
.
Of
the
ambition
to
win
power
and
renown
for
my
*NL*
wretched
self
,
she
has
formed
the
ambition
to
spread
my
Master
's
kingdom
;
*NL*
to
achieve
victories
for
the
standard
of
the
cross
.
So
much
has
religion
*NL*
done
for
me
;
turning
the
original
materials
to
the
best
account
;
pruning
*NL*
and
training
nature
.
But
she
could
not
eradicate
nature
:
nor
will
it
be
*NL*
eradicated
'till
this
mortal
shall
put
on
immortality
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Having
said
this
,
he
took
his
hat
,
which
lay
on
the
table
beside
my
*NL*
palette
.
Once
more
he
looked
at
the
portrait
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
_
is
_
lovely
,
''
he
murmured
.
``
She
is
well
named
the
Rose
of
the
*NL*
World
,
indeed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
may
I
not
paint
one
like
it
for
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Cui
bono
_
?
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
drew
over
the
picture
the
sheet
of
thin
paper
on
which
I
was
*NL*
accustomed
to
rest
my
hand
in
painting
,
to
prevent
the
cardboard
from
*NL*
being
sullied
.
What
he
suddenly
saw
on
this
blank
paper
,
it
was
*NL*
impossible
for
me
to
tell
;
but
something
had
caught
his
eye
.
He
took
it
*NL*
up
with
a
snatch
;
he
looked
at
the
edge
;
then
shot
a
glance
at
me
,
*NL*
inexpressibly
peculiar
,
and
quite
incomprehensible
:
a
glance
that
seemed
*NL*
to
take
and
make
note
of
every
point
in
my
shape
,
face
,
and
dress
;
for
it
*NL*
traversed
all
,
quick
,
keen
as
lightning
.
His
lips
parted
,
as
if
to
*NL*
speak
:
but
he
checked
the
coming
sentence
,
whatever
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
in
the
world
,
''
was
the
reply
;
and
,
replacing
the
paper
,
I
saw
*NL*
him
dexterously
tear
a
narrow
slip
from
the
margin
.
It
disappeared
in
*NL*
his
glove
;
and
,
with
one
hasty
nod
and
``
good-afternoon
,
''
he
vanished
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
I
exclaimed
,
using
an
expression
of
the
district
,
``
that
caps
the
*NL*
globe
,
however
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
,
in
my
turn
,
scrutinised
the
paper
;
but
saw
nothing
on
it
save
a
few
*NL*
dingy
stains
of
paint
where
I
had
tried
the
tint
in
my
pencil
.
I
*NL*
pondered
the
mystery
a
minute
or
two
;
but
finding
it
insolvable
,
and
*NL*
being
certain
it
could
not
be
of
much
moment
,
I
dismissed
,
and
soon
*NL*
forgot
it
.

CHAPTER
XXXIII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Mr.
St.
John
went
,
it
was
beginning
to
snow
;
the
whirling
storm
*NL*
continued
all
night
.
The
next
day
a
keen
wind
brought
fresh
and
blinding
*NL*
falls
;
by
twilight
the
valley
was
drifted
up
and
almost
impassable
.
I
*NL*
had
closed
my
shutter
,
laid
a
mat
to
the
door
to
prevent
the
snow
from
*NL*
blowing
in
under
it
,
trimmed
my
fire
,
and
after
sitting
nearly
an
hour
on
*NL*
the
hearth
listening
to
the
muffled
fury
of
the
tempest
,
I
lit
a
candle
,
*NL*
took
down
``
Marmion
,
''
and
beginning
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Day
set
on
Norham
's
castled
steep
,
*NL*
And
Tweed
's
fair
river
broad
and
deep
,
*NL*
And
Cheviot
's
mountains
lone
;
*NL*
The
massive
towers
,
the
donjon
keep
,
*NL*
The
flanking
walls
that
round
them
sweep
,
*NL*
In
yellow
lustre
shone
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
I
soon
forgot
storm
in
music
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
heard
a
noise
:
the
wind
,
I
thought
,
shook
the
door
.
No
;
it
was
St.
*NL*
John
Rivers
,
who
,
lifting
the
latch
,
came
in
out
of
the
frozen
*NL*
hurricane
--
the
howling
darkness
--
and
stood
before
me
:
the
cloak
that
*NL*
covered
his
tall
figure
all
white
as
a
glacier
.
I
was
almost
in
*NL*
consternation
,
so
little
had
I
expected
any
guest
from
the
blocked-up
*NL*
vale
that
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Any
ill
news
?
''
I
demanded
.
``
Has
anything
happened
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
How
very
easily
alarmed
you
are
!
''
he
answered
,
removing
his
cloak
*NL*
and
hanging
it
up
against
the
door
,
towards
which
he
again
coolly
pushed
*NL*
the
mat
which
his
entrance
had
deranged
.
He
stamped
the
snow
from
his
*NL*
boots
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
sully
the
purity
of
your
floor
,
''
said
he
,
``
but
you
must
excuse
*NL*
me
for
once
.
''
Then
he
approached
the
fire
.
``
I
have
had
hard
work
to
get
*NL*
here
,
I
assure
you
,
''
he
observed
,
as
he
warmed
his
hands
over
the
flame
.
*NL*
``
One
drift
took
me
up
to
the
waist
;
happily
the
snow
is
quite
soft
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
are
you
come
?
''
I
could
not
forbear
saying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rather
an
inhospitable
question
to
put
to
a
visitor
;
but
since
you
ask
*NL*
it
,
I
answer
simply
to
have
a
little
talk
with
you
;
I
got
tired
of
my
*NL*
mute
books
and
empty
rooms
.
Besides
,
since
yesterday
I
have
experienced
*NL*
the
excitement
of
a
person
to
whom
a
tale
has
been
half-told
,
and
who
is
*NL*
impatient
to
hear
the
sequel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
down
.
I
recalled
his
singular
conduct
of
yesterday
,
and
really
I
*NL*
began
to
fear
his
wits
were
touched
.
If
he
were
insane
,
however
,
his
was
*NL*
a
very
cool
and
collected
insanity
:
I
had
never
seen
that
*NL*
handsome-featured
face
of
his
look
more
like
chiselled
marble
than
it
did
*NL*
just
now
,
as
he
put
aside
his
snow-wet
hair
from
his
forehead
and
let
the
*NL*
firelight
shine
free
on
his
pale
brow
and
cheek
as
pale
,
where
it
grieved
*NL*
me
to
discover
the
hollow
trace
of
care
or
sorrow
now
so
plainly
graved
.
*NL*
I
waited
,
expecting
he
would
say
something
I
could
at
least
comprehend
;
*NL*
but
his
hand
was
now
at
his
chin
,
his
finger
on
his
lip
:
he
was
thinking
.
*NL*
It
struck
me
that
his
hand
looked
wasted
like
his
face
.
A
perhaps
*NL*
uncalled-for
gush
of
pity
came
over
my
heart
:
I
was
moved
to
say
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
Diana
or
Mary
would
come
and
live
with
you
:
it
is
too
bad
that
*NL*
you
should
be
quite
alone
;
and
you
are
recklessly
rash
about
your
own
*NL*
health
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
,
''
said
he
:
``
I
care
for
myself
when
necessary
.
I
am
well
now
.
*NL*
What
do
you
see
amiss
in
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
said
with
a
careless
,
abstracted
indifference
,
which
showed
that
*NL*
my
solicitude
was
,
at
least
in
his
opinion
,
wholly
superfluous
.
I
was
*NL*
silenced
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
still
slowly
moved
his
finger
over
his
upper
lip
,
and
still
his
eye
*NL*
dwelt
dreamily
on
the
glowing
grate
;
thinking
it
urgent
to
say
something
,
*NL*
I
asked
him
presently
if
he
felt
any
cold
draught
from
the
door
,
which
*NL*
was
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
!
''
he
responded
shortly
and
somewhat
testily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
I
reflected
,
``
if
you
wo
n't
talk
,
you
may
be
still
;
I
'll
let
you
*NL*
alone
now
,
and
return
to
my
book
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
I
snuffed
the
candle
and
resumed
the
perusal
of
``
Marmion
.
''
He
soon
*NL*
stirred
;
my
eye
was
instantly
drawn
to
his
movements
;
he
only
took
out
a
*NL*
morocco
pocket-book
,
thence
produced
a
letter
,
which
he
read
in
silence
,
*NL*
folded
it
,
put
it
back
,
relapsed
into
meditation
.
It
was
vain
to
try
to
*NL*
read
with
such
an
inscrutable
fixture
before
me
;
nor
could
I
,
in
*NL*
impatience
,
consent
to
be
dumb
;
he
might
rebuff
me
if
he
liked
,
but
talk
*NL*
I
would
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
heard
from
Diana
and
Mary
lately
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
since
the
letter
I
showed
you
a
week
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
has
not
been
any
change
made
about
your
own
arrangements
?
You
*NL*
will
not
be
summoned
to
leave
England
sooner
than
you
expected
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
fear
not
,
indeed
:
such
chance
is
too
good
to
befall
me
.
''
Baffled
so
*NL*
far
,
I
changed
my
ground
.
I
bethought
myself
to
talk
about
the
school
*NL*
and
my
scholars
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mary
Garrett
's
mother
is
better
,
and
Mary
came
back
to
the
school
this
*NL*
morning
,
and
I
shall
have
four
new
girls
next
week
from
the
Foundry
*NL*
Close
--
they
would
have
come
to-day
but
for
the
snow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Oliver
pays
for
two
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
means
to
give
the
whole
school
a
treat
at
Christmas
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
it
your
suggestion
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whose
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
daughter
's
,
I
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
like
her
:
she
is
so
good-natured
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
came
the
blank
of
a
pause
:
the
clock
struck
eight
strokes
.
It
*NL*
aroused
him
;
he
uncrossed
his
legs
,
sat
erect
,
turned
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
your
book
a
moment
,
and
come
a
little
nearer
the
fire
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wondering
,
and
of
my
wonder
finding
no
end
,
I
complied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Half-an-hour
ago
,
''
he
pursued
,
``
I
spoke
of
my
impatience
to
hear
the
*NL*
sequel
of
a
tale
:
on
reflection
,
I
find
the
matter
will
be
better
managed
*NL*
by
my
assuming
the
narrator
's
part
,
and
converting
you
into
a
listener
.
*NL*
Before
commencing
,
it
is
but
fair
to
warn
you
that
the
story
will
sound
*NL*
somewhat
hackneyed
in
your
ears
;
but
stale
details
often
regain
a
degree
*NL*
of
freshness
when
they
pass
through
new
lips
.
For
the
rest
,
whether
*NL*
trite
or
novel
,
it
is
short
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Twenty
years
ago
,
a
poor
curate
--
never
mind
his
name
at
this
moment
--
fell
*NL*
in
love
with
a
rich
man
's
daughter
;
she
fell
in
love
with
him
,
and
*NL*
married
him
,
against
the
advice
of
all
her
friends
,
who
consequently
*NL*
disowned
her
immediately
after
the
wedding
.
Before
two
years
passed
,
the
*NL*
rash
pair
were
both
dead
,
and
laid
quietly
side
by
side
under
one
slab
.
*NL*
-LRB-
I
have
seen
their
grave
;
it
formed
part
of
the
pavement
of
a
huge
*NL*
churchyard
surrounding
the
grim
,
soot-black
old
cathedral
of
an
overgrown
*NL*
manufacturing
town
in
--
shire
.
-RRB-
They
left
a
daughter
,
which
,
at
its
*NL*
very
birth
,
Charity
received
in
her
lap
--
cold
as
that
of
the
snow-drift
I
*NL*
almost
stuck
fast
in
to-night
.
Charity
carried
the
friendless
thing
to
*NL*
the
house
of
its
rich
maternal
relations
;
it
was
reared
by
an
aunt-in
-
*NL*
law
,
called
-LRB-
I
come
to
names
now
-RRB-
Mrs.
Reed
of
Gateshead
.
You
start
--
did
*NL*
you
hear
a
noise
?
I
daresay
it
is
only
a
rat
scrambling
along
the
*NL*
rafters
of
the
adjoining
schoolroom
:
it
was
a
barn
before
I
had
it
*NL*
repaired
and
altered
,
and
barns
are
generally
haunted
by
rats

To

Mrs.
Reed
kept
the
orphan
ten
years
:
whether
it
was
happy
or
*NL*
not
with
her
,
I
can
not
say
,
never
having
been
told
;
but
at
the
end
of
*NL*
that
time
she
transferred
it
to
a
place
you
know
--
being
no
other
than
*NL*
Lowood
School
,
where
you
so
long
resided
yourself
.
It
seems
her
career
*NL*
there
was
very
honourable
:
from
a
pupil
,
she
became
a
teacher
,
like
*NL*
yourself
--
really
it
strikes
me
there
are
parallel
points
in
her
history
*NL*
and
yours
--
she
left
it
to
be
a
governess
:
there
,
again
,
your
fates
were
*NL*
analogous
;
she
undertook
the
education
of
the
ward
of
a
certain
Mr.
*NL*
Rochester
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Rivers
!
''
I
interrupted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
guess
your
feelings
,
''
he
said
,
``
but
restrain
them
for
a
while
:
I
*NL*
have
nearly
finished
;
hear
me
to
the
end
.
Of
Mr.
Rochester
's
character
I
*NL*
know
nothing
,
but
the
one
fact
that
he
professed
to
offer
honourable
*NL*
marriage
to
this
young
girl
,
and
that
at
the
very
altar
she
discovered
he
*NL*
had
a
wife
yet
alive
,
though
a
lunatic
.
What
his
subsequent
conduct
and
*NL*
proposals
were
is
a
matter
of
pure
conjecture
;
but
when
an
event
*NL*
transpired
which
rendered
inquiry
after
the
governess
necessary
,
it
was
*NL*
discovered
she
was
gone
--
no
one
could
tell
when
,
where
,
or
how
.
She
had
*NL*
left
Thornfield
Hall
in
the
night
;
every
research
after
her
course
had
*NL*
been
vain
:
the
country
had
been
scoured
far
and
wide
;
no
vestige
of
*NL*
information
could
be
gathered
respecting
her
.
Yet
that
she
should
be
*NL*
found
is
become
a
matter
of
serious
urgency
:
advertisements
have
been
put
*NL*
in
all
the
papers
;
I
myself
have
received
a
letter
from
one
Mr.
Briggs
,
a
*NL*
solicitor
,
communicating
the
details
I
have
just
imparted
.
Is
it
not
an
*NL*
odd
tale
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
tell
me
this
,
''
said
I
,
``
and
since
you
know
so
much
,
you
surely
can
*NL*
tell
it
me
--
what
of
Mr.
Rochester
?
How
and
where
is
he
?
What
is
he
*NL*
doing
?
Is
he
well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
ignorant
of
all
concerning
Mr.
Rochester
:
the
letter
never
mentions
*NL*
him
but
to
narrate
the
fraudulent
and
illegal
attempt
I
have
adverted
to
.
*NL*
You
should
rather
ask
the
name
of
the
governess
--
the
nature
of
the
event
*NL*
which
requires
her
appearance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
no
one
go
to
Thornfield
Hall
,
then
?
Did
no
one
see
Mr.
Rochester
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
they
wrote
to
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
did
he
say
?
Who
has
his
letters
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Briggs
intimates
that
the
answer
to
his
application
was
not
from
Mr.
*NL*
Rochester
,
but
from
a
lady
:
it
is
signed
`
Alice
Fairfax
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
cold
and
dismayed
:
my
worst
fears
then
were
probably
true
:
he
had
*NL*
in
all
probability
left
England
and
rushed
in
reckless
desperation
to
*NL*
some
former
haunt
on
the
Continent
.
And
what
opiate
for
his
severe
*NL*
sufferings
--
what
object
for
his
strong
passions
--
had
he
sought
there
?
I
*NL*
dared
not
answer
the
question
.
Oh
,
my
poor
master
--
once
almost
my
*NL*
husband
--
whom
I
had
often
called
``
my
dear
Edward
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
must
have
been
a
bad
man
,
''
observed
Mr.
Rivers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
know
him
--
do
n't
pronounce
an
opinion
upon
him
,
''
I
said
,
with
*NL*
warmth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
he
answered
quietly
:
``
and
indeed
my
head
is
otherwise
*NL*
occupied
than
with
him
:
I
have
my
tale
to
finish
.
Since
you
wo
n't
ask
*NL*
the
governess
's
name
,
I
must
tell
it
of
my
own
accord
.
Stay
!
I
have
it
*NL*
here
--
it
is
always
more
satisfactory
to
see
important
points
written
*NL*
down
,
fairly
committed
to
black
and
white
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
pocket-book
was
again
deliberately
produced
,
opened
,
sought
*NL*
through
;
from
one
of
its
compartments
was
extracted
a
shabby
slip
of
*NL*
paper
,
hastily
torn
off
:
I
recognised
in
its
texture
and
its
stains
of
*NL*
ultra-marine
,
and
lake
,
and
vermillion
,
the
ravished
margin
of
the
*NL*
portrait-cover
.
He
got
up
,
held
it
close
to
my
eyes
:
and
I
read
,
traced
*NL*
in
Indian
ink
,
in
my
own
handwriting
,
the
words
``
JANE
EYRE
''
--
the
work
*NL*
doubtless
of
some
moment
of
abstraction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Briggs
wrote
to
me
of
a
Jane
Eyre
:
''
he
said
,
``
the
advertisements
*NL*
demanded
a
Jane
Eyre
:
I
knew
a
Jane
Elliott
.
--
I
confess
I
had
my
*NL*
suspicions
,
but
it
was
only
yesterday
afternoon
they
were
at
once
*NL*
resolved
into
certainty
.
You
own
the
name
and
renounce
the
_
alias

?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
yes
;
but
where
is
Mr.
Briggs

He
perhaps
knows
more
of
Mr.

Rochester

you
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Briggs
is
in
London

I
should
doubt
his
knowing
anything
at
all
about

not
in
Mr.
Rochester

is
interested

Meantime
,

you
forget
essential
points
in
pursuing
trifles
:

do
not
inquire

*NL*

Silence
succeeded

*NL*
*NL*
``

must
prove
your

resumed
St.
John
presently
:
``
a
*NL*
step
which
will
offer
no
difficulties
;
you
can
then
enter
on
immediate
*NL*
possession

the
*NL*
will

''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
was
a
new
card
turned
up
!
It
is
a
fine
thing
,
reader
,
to
be
lifted
*NL*
in
a
moment
from
indigence
to
wealth
--
a
very
fine
thing
;
but
not
a
matter
*NL*
one
can
comprehend
,
or
consequently
enjoy
,
all
at
once
.
And
then
there
*NL*
are
other
chances
in
life
far
more
thrilling
and
rapture-giving
:
_
this
_
*NL*
is
solid
,
an
affair
of
the
actual
world
,
nothing
ideal
about
it
:
all
its
*NL*
associations
are
solid
and
sober
,
and
its
manifestations
are
the
same
.
*NL*
One
does
not
jump
,
and
spring
,
and
shout
hurrah
!
at
hearing
one
has
got
a
*NL*
fortune
;
one
begins
to
consider
responsibilities
,
and
to
ponder
business
;
*NL*
on
a
base
of
steady
satisfaction
rise
certain
grave
cares
,
and
we
contain
*NL*
ourselves
,
and
brood
over
our
bliss
with
a
solemn
brow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
,
the
words
Legacy
,
Bequest
,
go
side
by
side
with
the
words
,
*NL*
Death
,
Funeral
.
My
uncle
I
had
heard
was
dead
--
my
only
relative
;
ever
*NL*
since
being
made
aware
of
his
existence
,
I
had
cherished
the
hope
of
one
*NL*
day
seeing
him
:
now
,
I
never
should
.
And
then
this
money
came
only
to
*NL*
me
:
not
to
me
and
a
rejoicing
family
,
but
to
my
isolated
self
.
It
was
a
*NL*
grand
boon
doubtless
;
and
independence
would
be
glorious
--
yes
,
I
felt
*NL*
that
--
that
thought
swelled
my
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
unbend
your
forehead
at
last
,
''
said
Mr.
Rivers
.
``
I
thought
Medusa
*NL*
had
looked
at
you
,
and
that
you
were
turning
to
stone
.
Perhaps
now
you
*NL*
will
ask
how
much
you
are
worth
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
am
I
worth
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
a
trifle
!
Nothing
of
course
to
speak
of
--
twenty
thousand
pounds
,
I
*NL*
think
they
say
--
but
what
is
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Twenty
thousand
pounds
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
was
a
new
stunner
--
I
had
been
calculating
on
four
or
five
thousand
.
*NL*
This
news
actually
took
my
breath
for
a
moment
:
Mr.
St.
John
,
whom
I
had
*NL*
never
heard
laugh
before
,
laughed
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
he
,
``
if
you
had
committed
a
murder
,
and
I
had
told
you
your
*NL*
crime
was
discovered
,
you
could
scarcely
look
more
aghast
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
large
sum
--
do
n't
you
think
there
is
a
mistake
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
mistake
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
you
have
read
the
figures
wrong
--
it
may
be
two
thousand
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
written
in
letters
,
not
figures
,
--
twenty
thousand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
again
felt
rather
like
an
individual
of
but
average
gastronomical
*NL*
powers
sitting
down
to
feast
alone
at
a
table
spread
with
provisions
for
*NL*
a
hundred
.
Mr.
Rivers
rose
now
and
put
his
cloak
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
were
not
such
a
very
wild
night
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
would
send
Hannah
*NL*
down
to
keep
you
company
:
you
look
too
desperately
miserable
to
be
left
*NL*
alone
.
But
Hannah
,
poor
woman
!
could
not
stride
the
drifts
so
well
as
I
:
*NL*
her
legs
are
not
quite
so
long
:
so
I
must
e
`
en
leave
you
to
your
sorrows
.
*NL*
Good-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
lifting
the
latch
:
a
sudden
thought
occurred
to
me
.
``
Stop
one
*NL*
minute
!
''
I
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
puzzles
me
to
know
why
Mr.
Briggs
wrote
to
you
about
me
;
or
how
he
*NL*
knew
you
,
or
could
fancy
that
you
,
living
in
such
an
out-of-the-way
*NL*
place
,
had
the
power
to
aid
in
my
discovery
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
I
am
a
clergyman
,
''
he
said
;
``
and
the
clergy
are
often
appealed
to
*NL*
about
odd
matters
.
''
Again
the
latch
rattled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
that
does
not
satisfy
me
!
''
I
exclaimed
:
and
indeed
there
was
*NL*
something
in
the
hasty
and
unexplanatory
reply
which
,
instead
of
*NL*
allaying
,
piqued
my
curiosity
more
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
very
strange
piece
of
business
,
''
I
added
;
``
I
must
know
more
*NL*
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Another
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
to-night
!
--
to-night

''
and
as
he
turned
from
the
door
,
I
placed
*NL*
myself
between
it
and
him
.
He
looked
rather
embarrassed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
certainly
shall
not
go
till
you
have
told
me
all
,
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
rather
not
just
now

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

you
must

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
rather
Diana
or
Mary
informed
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
these
objections
wrought
my
eagerness
to
a
climax
:
gratified
it
*NL*
must
be
,
and
that
without
delay
;
and
I
told
him
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
apprised
you
that
I
was
a
hard
man
,
''
said
he
,
``
difficult
to

persuade

``

then

he
pursued

me

*NL*
``

all
the
snow
from
your
cloak

by
the

token

it
has
streamed
on

made
it

yield

have
at
different
times
lent
me

I

never
asked

what
then

Surely

*NL*
*NL*
I
stopped

I
could
not

much
less
to
express

thought

rushed
upon
me
--
that
embodied
itself

--
that
,
in
a

second

stood
out
a
strong

solid
probability

Circumstances
knit
*NL*
themselves

fitted
themselves

shot
into
order

the
chain

had
been

lying
hitherto
a
formless
lump
of
links
was
drawn
out
straight

every

ring
was
perfect

the
connection
complete

I
knew

by
instinct

how
the

stood

had
said
another
word

have
the
same
intuitive
perception
,
so
I
must
repeat
his
*NL*
explanation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
mother
's
name
was
Eyre
;
she
had
two
brothers
;
one
a
clergyman
,
who
*NL*
married
Miss
Jane
Reed
,
of
Gateshead
;
the
other
,
John
Eyre
,
Esq.
,
*NL*
merchant
,
late
of
Funchal
,
Madeira
.
Mr.
Briggs
,
being
Mr.
Eyre
's
*NL*
solicitor
,
wrote
to
us
last
August
to
inform
us
of
our
uncle
's
death
,
and
*NL*
to
say
that
he
had
left
his
property
to
his
brother
the
clergyman
's
*NL*
orphan
daughter
,
overlooking
us
,
in
consequence
of
a
quarrel
,
never
*NL*
forgiven
,
between
him
and
my
father
.
He
wrote
again
a
few
weeks
since
,
*NL*
to
intimate
that
the
heiress
was
lost
,
and
asking
if
we
knew
anything
of
*NL*
her
.
A
name
casually
written
on
a
slip
of
paper
has
enabled
me
to
find
*NL*
her
out
.
You
know
the
rest
.
''
Again
he
was
going
,
but
I
set
my
back
*NL*
against
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
let
me
speak
,
''
I
said
;
``
let
me
have
one
moment
to
draw
breath
and
*NL*
reflect
.
''
I
paused
--
he
stood
before
me
,
hat
in
hand
,
looking
composed
*NL*
enough
.
I
resumed
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
mother
was
my
father
's
sister
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
aunt
,
consequently
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
bowed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
uncle
John
was
your
uncle
John
?
You
,
Diana
,
and
Mary
are
his
*NL*
sister
's
children
,
as
I
am
his
brother
's
child
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Undeniably
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
three
,
then
,
are
my
cousins
;
half
our
blood
on
each
side
flows
from
*NL*
the
same
source
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
cousins
;
yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
surveyed
him
.
It
seemed
I
had
found
a
brother
:
one
I
could
be
proud
*NL*
of
,
--
one
I
could
love
;
and
two
sisters
,
whose
qualities
were
such
,
that
,
*NL*
when
I
knew
them
but
as
mere
strangers
,
they
had
inspired
me
with
genuine
*NL*
affection
and
admiration
.
The
two
girls
,
on
whom
,
kneeling
down
on
the
*NL*
wet
ground
,
and
looking
through
the
low
,
latticed
window
of
Moor
House
*NL*
kitchen
,
I
had
gazed
with
so
bitter
a
mixture
of
interest
and
despair
,
*NL*
were
my
near
kinswomen
;
and
the
young
and
stately
gentleman
who
had
found
*NL*
me
almost
dying
at
his
threshold
was
my
blood
relation
.
Glorious
*NL*
discovery
to
a
lonely
wretch
!
This
was
wealth
indeed
!
--
wealth
to
the
*NL*
heart
!
--
a
mine
of
pure
,
genial
affections
.
This
was
a
blessing
,
bright
,
*NL*
vivid
,
and
exhilarating
;
--
not
like
the
ponderous
gift
of
gold
:
rich
and
*NL*
welcome
enough
in
its
way
,
but
sobering
from
its
weight
.
I
now
clapped
*NL*
my
hands
in
sudden
joy
--
my
pulse
bounded
,
my
veins
thrilled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
am
glad
!
--
I
am
glad
!
''
I
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
St.
John
smiled
.
``
Did
I
not
say
you
neglected
essential
points
to
pursue
*NL*
trifles
?
''
he
asked
.
``
You
were
serious
when
I
told
you
you
had
got
a
*NL*
fortune
;
and
now
,
for
a
matter
of
no
moment
,
you
are
excited
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
you
mean
?
It
may
be
of
no
moment
to
you
;
you
have
sisters
and
*NL*
do
n't
care
for
a
cousin
;
but
I
had
nobody
;
and
now
three
relations
,
--
or
*NL*
two
,
if
you
do
n't
choose
to
be
counted
,
--
are
born
into
my
world
*NL*
full-grown
.
I
say
again
,
I
am
glad
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
walked
fast
through
the
room
:
I
stopped
,
half
suffocated
with
the
*NL*
thoughts
that
rose
faster
than
I
could
receive
,
comprehend
,
settle
*NL*
them
:
--
thoughts
of
what
might
,
could
,
would
,
and
should
be
,
and
that
ere
*NL*
long
.
I
looked
at
the
blank
wall
:
it
seemed
a
sky
thick
with
ascending
*NL*
stars
,
--
every
one
lit
me
to
a
purpose
or
delight
.
Those
who
had
saved
my
*NL*
life
,
whom
,
till
this
hour
,
I
had
loved
barrenly
,
I
could
now
benefit
.
*NL*
They
were
under
a
yoke
,
--
I
could
free
them
:
they
were
scattered
,
--
I
could
*NL*
reunite
them
:
the
independence
,
the
affluence
which
was
mine
,
might
be
*NL*
theirs
too
.
Were
we
not
four
?
Twenty
thousand
pounds
shared
equally
*NL*
would
be
five
thousand
each
,
justice
--
enough
and
to
spare
:
justice
would
*NL*
be
done
,
--
mutual
happiness
secured
.
Now
the
wealth
did
not
weigh
on
me
:
*NL*
now
it
was
not
a
mere
bequest
of
coin
,
--
it
was
a
legacy
of
life
,
hope
,
*NL*
enjoyment
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
I
looked
while
these
ideas
were
taking
my
spirit
by
storm
,
I
can
not
*NL*
tell
;
but
I
perceived
soon
that
Mr.
Rivers
had
placed
a
chair
behind
me
,
*NL*
and
was
gently
attempting
to
make
me
sit
down
on
it
.
He
also
advised
me
*NL*
to
be
composed
;
I
scorned
the
insinuation
of
helplessness
and
*NL*
distraction
,
shook
off
his
hand
,
and
began
to
walk
about
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Write
to
Diana
and
Mary
to-morrow
,
''
I
said
,
``
and
tell
them
to
come
home
*NL*
directly
.
Diana
said
they
would
both
consider
themselves
rich
with
a
*NL*
thousand
pounds
,
so
with
five
thousand
they
will
do
very
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
where
I
can
get
you
a
glass
of
water
,
''
said
St.
John
;
``
you
must
*NL*
really
make
an
effort
to
tranquillise
your
feelings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
!
and
what
sort
of
an
effect
will
the
bequest
have
on
you
?
Will
*NL*
it
keep
you
in
England
,
induce
you
to
marry
Miss
Oliver
,
and
settle
down
*NL*
like
an
ordinary
mortal
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wander
:
your
head
becomes
confused
.
I
have
been
too
abrupt
in
*NL*
communicating
the
news
;
it
has
excited
you
beyond
your
strength
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Rivers
!
you
quite
put
me
out
of
patience
:
I
am
rational
enough
;
it
*NL*
is
you
who
misunderstand
,
or
rather
who
affect
to
misunderstand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
,
if
you
explained
yourself
a
little
more
fully
,
I
should
*NL*
comprehend
better

*NL*
*NL*
``
Explain
!
What
is
there
to
explain

You
can
not
fail
to
see
that
twenty
*NL*
thousand
pounds
,
the
sum
in
question
,
divided
equally
between
the
nephew
*NL*
and
three
nieces
of
our
uncle
,
will
give
five
thousand
to
each
?
What
I
*NL*
want
is
,
that
you
should
write
to
your
sisters
and
tell
them
of
the
*NL*
fortune
that
has
accrued
to
them
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
To
you
,
you
mean

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
intimated
my
view
of
the
case
:
I
am
incapable
of
taking
any
*NL*
other

I
am
not
brutally
selfish
,
blindly
unjust
,
or
fiendishly
*NL*
ungrateful
.
Besides
,
I
am
resolved
I
will
have
a
home
and
connections
.
I
*NL*
like
Moor
House
,
and
I
will
live
at
Moor
House
;
I
like
Diana
and
Mary
,
*NL*
and
I
will
attach
myself
for
life
to
Diana

Mary
.
It
would
please

*NL*
benefit
me
to
have
five
thousand
pounds
;
it
would
torment
and
oppress
me
*NL*

have
twenty
thousand

which
,
moreover
,
could
never
be
mine
in
justice

though
it
might
in
law

I
abandon
to
you

what
is
absolutely
*NL*
superfluous
to
me

Let
there
be
no
opposition

no
discussion
about

it

us
agree
amongst
each
other
,
and
decide
the
point
at
once

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
acting
on
first
impulses
;
you
must
take
days
to
consider
such
a
*NL*
matter
,
ere
your
word
can
be
regarded
as
valid

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
if
all
you
doubt

my
sincerity

justice

case

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

do

see

certain
justice

contrary

entire

was
free

leave
it
to
whom
he
would
:
he
left
it
to

After
all

*NL*
justice
permits
you
to
keep
it

with

clear
conscience

consider
it

Mr.

out

CHAPTER
XXXIV

*NL*
*NL*
It
was
near
Christmas
by
the
time
all
was
settled
:
the
season
of
general
*NL*
holiday
approached

I
now
closed
Morton
school

taking
care
that
the
*NL*
parting
should
not
be
barren
on
my
side

Good
fortune
opens
the
hand
as
*NL*
well
as
the
heart
wonderfully

and
to
give
somewhat
when
we
have
largely
*NL*
received
,
is
but
to
afford
a
vent
to
the
unusual
ebullition
of
the
*NL*
sensations
.
I
had
long
felt
with
pleasure
that
many
of
my
rustic
*NL*
scholars
liked
me
,
and
when
we
parted
,
that
consciousness
was
confirmed
:
*NL*
they
manifested
their
affection
plainly
and
strongly
.
Deep
was
my
*NL*
gratification
to
find
I
had
really
a
place
in
their
unsophisticated
*NL*
hearts
:
I
promised
them
that
never
a
week
should
pass
in
future
that
I
*NL*
did
not
visit
them
,
and
give
them
an
hour
's
teaching
in
their
school
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Rivers
came
up
as
,
having
seen
the
classes
,
now
numbering
sixty
*NL*
girls
,
file
out
before
me
,
and
locked
the
door
,
I
stood
with
the
key
in
*NL*
my
hand
,
exchanging
a
few
words
of
special
farewell
with
some
half-dozen
*NL*
of
my
best
scholars
:
as
decent
,
respectable
,
modest
,
and
well-informed
*NL*
young
women
as
could
be
found
in
the
ranks
of
the
British
peasantry
.
And
*NL*
that
is
saying
a
great
deal
;
for
after
all
,
the
British
peasantry
are
the
*NL*
best
taught
,
best
mannered
,
most
self-respecting
of
any
in
Europe
:
since
*NL*
those
days
I
have
seen
paysannes
and
Bauerinnen
;
and
the
best
of
them
*NL*
seemed
to
me
ignorant
,
coarse
,
and
besotted
,
compared
with
my
Morton
*NL*
girls
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
consider
you
have
got
your
reward
for
a
season
of
exertion
?
''
*NL*
asked
Mr.
Rivers
,
when
they
were
gone
.
``
Does
not
the
consciousness
of
*NL*
having
done
some
real
good
in
your
day
and
generation
give
pleasure
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doubtless
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
have
only
toiled
a
few
months
!
Would
not
a
life
devoted
to
the
*NL*
task
of
regenerating
your
race
be
well
spent
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
I
said
;
``
but
I
could
not
go
on
for
ever
so
:
I
want
to
enjoy
my
own
*NL*
faculties
as
well
as
to
cultivate
those
of
other
people
.
I
must
enjoy
*NL*
them
now
;
do
n't
recall
either
my
mind
or
body
to
the
school
;
I
am
out
of
*NL*
it
and
disposed
for
full
holiday
.

*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
grave
.
``
What
now
?
What
sudden
eagerness
is
this
you
evince
?
*NL*
What
are
you
going
to
do
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
active
:
as
active
as
I
can

And
first
I
must
beg
you
to
set
*NL*
Hannah
at
liberty
,
and
get
somebody
else
to
wait
on
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
want
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
to
go
with
me
to
Moor
House
.
Diana
and
Mary
will
be
at
home
in
a
*NL*
week
,
and
I
want
to
have
everything
in
order
against
their
arrival
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand

I
thought
you
were
for
flying
off

go
with
you

*NL*
``
Tell

*NL*
He
took
it
.
``
You
give
it
up
very
gleefully
,
''
said
he
;
``
I
do
n't
quite

yourself

for
the
one
you
are

relinquishing

What
aim

ambition
in

you
*NL*
now

clean
down

my
next
to
rub
it
up
with
bees-wax

,

an
indefinite
number
of

it
glitters
again
;
my
third

to
arrange
every

I
shall
go
near

keep
up
good

*NL*
lastly
,
the
two
days
preceding
that
on
which
your

be
devoted
by

such
a
beating

compounding
of

chopping
up

can
convey

an
inadequate

to

is
to
have
all
things
in
an
absolutely
perfect

readiness

Diana

Mary
before
next
Thursday

*NL*
*NL*
St.
John
smiled
slightly
:
still
he
was
dissatisfied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
all
very
well
for
the
present

said
he
;
``

seriously

you

higher
than
domestic

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
best

I
interrupted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I
looked
at

with
surprise
.
``
St.

I
said
,

*NL*
``
To

turning
to

the

has
committed

your
keeping

of
which

''
*NL*
*NL*
Happy
at
Moor
House
I
was
,
and
hard
I
worked
;
and
so
did
Hannah
:
she
was
*NL*
charmed
to
see
how
jovial
I
could
be
amidst
the
bustle
of
a
house
turned
*NL*
topsy-turvy
--
how
I
could
brush
,
and
dust
,
and
clean
,
and
cook
.
And
*NL*
really
,
after
a
day
or
two
of
confusion
worse
confounded
,
it
was
*NL*
delightful
by
degrees
to
invoke
order
from
the
chaos
ourselves
had
made
.
*NL*
I
had
previously
taken
a
journey
to
S
--
to
purchase
some
new
furniture
:
*NL*
my
cousins
having
given
me
_
carte
blanche
_
to
effect
what
alterations
I
*NL*
pleased
,
and
a
sum
having
been
set
aside
for
that
purpose
.
The
ordinary
*NL*
sitting-room
and
bedrooms
I
left
much
as
they
were
:
for
I
knew
Diana
and
*NL*
Mary
would
derive
more
pleasure
from
seeing
again
the
old
homely
tables
,
*NL*
and
chairs
,
and
beds
,
than
from
the
spectacle
of
the
smartest
*NL*
innovations
.
Still
some
novelty
was
necessary
,
to
give
to
their
return
*NL*
the
piquancy
with
which
I
wished
it
to
be
invested
.
Dark
handsome
new
*NL*
carpets
and
curtains
,
an
arrangement
of
some
carefully
selected
antique
*NL*
ornaments
in
porcelain
and
bronze
,
new
coverings
,
and
mirrors
,
and
*NL*
dressing-cases
,
for
the
toilet
tables
,
answered
the
end
:
they
looked
*NL*
fresh
without
being
glaring
.
A
spare
parlour
and
bedroom
I
refurnished
*NL*
entirely
,
with
old
mahogany
and
crimson
upholstery
:
I
laid
canvas
on
the
*NL*
passage
,
and
carpets
on
the
stairs
.
When
all
was
finished
,
I
thought
*NL*
Moor
House
as
complete
a
model
of
bright
modest
snugness
within
,
as
it
*NL*
was
,
at
this
season
,
a
specimen
of
wintry
waste
and
desert
dreariness
*NL*
without
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
eventful
Thursday
at
length
came
.
They
were
expected
about
dark
,
and
*NL*
ere
dusk
fires
were
lit
upstairs
and
below
;
the
kitchen
was
in
perfect
*NL*
trim
;
Hannah
and
I
were
dressed
,
and
all
was
in
readiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
St.
John
arrived
first
.
I
had
entreated
him
to
keep
quite
clear
of
the
*NL*
house
till
everything
was
arranged
:
and
,
indeed
,
the
bare
idea
of
the
*NL*
commotion
,
at
once
sordid
and
trivial
,
going
on
within
its
walls
sufficed
*NL*
to
scare
him
to
estrangement
.
He
found
me
in
the
kitchen
,
watching
the
*NL*
progress
of
certain
cakes
for
tea
,
then
baking
.
Approaching
the
hearth
,
*NL*
he
asked
,
``
If
I
was
at
last
satisfied
with
housemaid
's
work
?
''
I
answered
*NL*
by
inviting
him
to
accompany
me
on
a
general
inspection
of
the
result
of
*NL*
my
labours
.
With
some
difficulty
,
I
got
him
to
make
the
tour
of
the
*NL*
house
.
He
just
looked
in
at
the
doors
I
opened
;
and
when
he
had
wandered
*NL*
upstairs
and
downstairs
,
he
said
I
must
have
gone
through
a
great
deal
of
*NL*
fatigue
and
trouble
to
have
effected
such
considerable
changes
in
so
*NL*
short
a
time
:
but
not
a
syllable
did
he
utter
indicating
pleasure
in
the
*NL*
improved
aspect
of
his
abode
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
silence
damped
me
.
I
thought
perhaps
the
alterations
had
disturbed
*NL*
some
old
associations
he
valued
.
I
inquired
whether
this
was
the
case
:
*NL*
no
doubt
in
a
somewhat
crest-fallen
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
;
he
had
,
on
the
contrary
,
remarked
that
I
had
scrupulously
*NL*
respected
every
association
:
he
feared
,
indeed
,
I
must
have
bestowed
more
*NL*
thought
on
the
matter
than
it
was
worth
.
How
many
minutes
,
for
instance
,
*NL*
had
I
devoted
to
studying
the
arrangement
of
this
very
room
?
--
By-the-bye
,
*NL*
could
I
tell
him
where
such
a
book
was
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
showed
him
the
volume
on
the
shelf
:
he
took
it
down
,
and
withdrawing
to
*NL*
his
accustomed
window
recess
,
he
began
to
read
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
I
did
not
like
this
,
reader
.
St.
John
was
a
good
man
;
but
I
began
*NL*
to
feel
he
had
spoken
truth
of
himself
when
he
said
he
was
hard
and
cold
.
*NL*
The
humanities
and
amenities
of
life
had
no
attraction
for
him
--
its
*NL*
peaceful
enjoyments
no
charm
.
Literally
,
he
lived
only
to
aspire
--
after
*NL*
what
was
good
and
great
,
certainly
;
but
still
he
would
never
rest
,
nor
*NL*
approve
of
others
resting
round
him
.
As
I
looked
at
his
lofty
forehead
,
*NL*
still
and
pale
as
a
white
stone
--
at
his
fine
lineaments
fixed
in
study
--
I
*NL*
comprehended
all
at
once
that
he
would
hardly
make
a
good
husband
:
that
*NL*
it
would
be
a
trying
thing
to
be
his
wife
.
I
understood
,
as
by
*NL*
inspiration
,
the
nature
of
his
love
for
Miss
Oliver
;
I
agreed
with
him
*NL*
that
it
was
but
a
love
of
the
senses
.
I
comprehended
how
he
should
*NL*
despise
himself
for
the
feverish
influence
it
exercised
over
him
;
how
he
*NL*
should
wish
to
stifle
and
destroy
it
;
how
he
should
mistrust
its
ever
*NL*
conducting
permanently
to
his
happiness
or
hers
.
I
saw
he
was
of
the
*NL*
material
from
which
nature
hews
her
heroes
--
Christian
and
Pagan
--
her
*NL*
lawgivers
,
her
statesmen
,
her
conquerors
:
a
steadfast
bulwark
for
great
*NL*
interests
to
rest
upon
;
but
,
at
the
fireside
,
too
often
a
cold
cumbrous
*NL*
column
,
gloomy
and
out
of
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
parlour
is
not
his
sphere
,
''
I
reflected
:
``
the
Himalayan
ridge
or
*NL*
Caffre
bush
,
even
the
plague-cursed
Guinea
Coast
swamp
would
suit
him
*NL*
better
.
Well
may
he
eschew
the
calm
of
domestic
life
;
it
is
not
his
*NL*
element
:
there
his
faculties
stagnate
--
they
can
not
develop
or
appear
to
*NL*
advantage
.
It
is
in
scenes
of
strife
and
danger
--
where
courage
is
*NL*
proved
,
and
energy
exercised
,
and
fortitude
tasked
--
that
he
will
speak
*NL*
and
move
,
the
leader
and
superior
.
A
merry
child
would
have
the
*NL*
advantage
of
him
on
this
hearth
.
He
is
right
to
choose
a
missionary
's
*NL*
career
--
I
see
it
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
coming
!
they
are
coming
!
''
cried
Hannah
,
throwing
open
the
*NL*
parlour
door
.
At
the
same
moment
old
Carlo
barked
joyfully
.
Out
I
ran
.
*NL*
It
was
now
dark
;
but
a
rumbling
of
wheels
was
audible
.
Hannah
soon
had
a
*NL*
lantern
lit
.
The
vehicle
had
stopped
at
the
wicket
;
the
driver
opened
*NL*
the
door
:
first
one
well-known
form
,
then
another
,
stepped
out
.
In
a
*NL*
minute
I
had
my
face
under
their
bonnets
,
in
contact
first
with
Mary
's
*NL*
soft
cheek
,
then
with
Diana
's
flowing
curls
.
They
laughed
--
kissed
*NL*
me
--
then
Hannah
:
patted
Carlo
,
who
was
half
wild
with
delight
;
asked
*NL*
eagerly
if
all
was
well
;
and
being
assured
in
the
affirmative
,
hastened
*NL*
into
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
stiff
with
their
long
and
jolting
drive
from
Whitcross
,
and
*NL*
chilled
with
the
frosty
night
air
;
but
their
pleasant
countenances
*NL*
expanded
to
the
cheerful
firelight
.
While
the
driver
and
Hannah
brought
*NL*
in
the
boxes
,
they
demanded
St.
John
.
At
this
moment
he
advanced
from
*NL*
the
parlour
.
They
both
threw
their
arms
round
his
neck
at
once
.
He
gave
*NL*
each
one
quiet
kiss
,
said
in
a
low
tone
a
few
words
of
welcome
,
stood
a
*NL*
while
to
be
talked
to
,
and
then
,
intimating
that
he
supposed
they
would
*NL*
soon
rejoin
him
in
the
parlour
,
withdrew
there
as
to
a
place
of
refuge
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
lit
their
candles
to
go
upstairs
,
but
Diana
had
first
to
give
*NL*
hospitable
orders
respecting
the
driver
;
this
done
,
both
followed
me
.
*NL*
They
were
delighted
with
the
renovation
and
decorations
of
their
rooms
;
*NL*
with
the
new
drapery
,
and
fresh
carpets
,
and
rich
tinted
china
vases
:
*NL*
they
expressed
their
gratification
ungrudgingly
.
I
had
the
pleasure
of
*NL*
feeling
that
my
arrangements
met
their
wishes
exactly
,
and
that
what
I
*NL*
had
done
added
a
vivid
charm
to
their
joyous
return
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sweet
was
that
evening
.
My
cousins
,
full
of
exhilaration
,
were
so
*NL*
eloquent
in
narrative
and
comment
,
that
their
fluency
covered
St.
John
's
*NL*
taciturnity
:
he
was
sincerely
glad
to
see
his
sisters
;
but
in
their
glow
*NL*
of
fervour
and
flow
of
joy
he
could
not
sympathise
.
The
event
of
the
*NL*
day
--
that
is
,
the
return
of
Diana
and
Mary
--
pleased
him
;
but
the
*NL*
accompaniments
of
that
event
,
the
glad
tumult
,
the
garrulous
glee
of
*NL*
reception
irked
him
:
I
saw
he
wished
the
calmer
morrow
was
come
.
In
the
*NL*
very
meridian
of
the
night
's
enjoyment
,
about
an
hour
after
tea
,
a
rap
*NL*
was
heard
at
the
door
.
Hannah
entered
with
the
intimation
that
``
a
poor
*NL*
lad
was
come
,
at
that
unlikely
time
,
to
fetch
Mr.
Rivers
to
see
his
*NL*
mother
,
who
was
drawing
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
does
she
live
,
Hannah
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Clear
up
at
Whitcross
Brow
,
almost
four
miles
off
,
and
moor
and
moss
all
*NL*
the
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
him
I
will
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
,
sir
,
you
had
better
not
.
It
's
the
worst
road
to
travel
after
*NL*
dark
that
can
be
:
there
's
no
track
at
all
over
the
bog
.
And
then
it
is
*NL*
such
a
bitter
night
--
the
keenest
wind
you
ever
felt
.
You
had
better
send
*NL*
word
,
sir
,
that
you
will
be
there
in
the
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
was
already
in
the
passage
,
putting
on
his
cloak
;
and
without
one
*NL*
objection
,
one
murmur
,
he
departed
.
It
was
then
nine
o'clock
:
he
did
not
*NL*
return
till
midnight
.
Starved
and
tired
enough
he
was
:
but
he
looked
*NL*
happier
than
when
he
set
out
.
He
had
performed
an
act
of
duty
;
made
an
*NL*
exertion
;
felt
his
own
strength
to
do
and
deny
,
and
was
on
better
terms
*NL*
with
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
afraid
the
whole
of
the
ensuing
week
tried
his
patience
.
It
was
*NL*
Christmas
week
:
we
took
to
no
settled
employment
,
but
spent
it
in
a
sort
*NL*
of
merry
domestic
dissipation
.
The
air
of
the
moors
,
the
freedom
of
*NL*
home
,
the
dawn
of
prosperity
,
acted
on
Diana
and
Mary
's
spirits
like
some
*NL*
life-giving
elixir
:
they
were
gay
from
morning
till
noon
,
and
from
noon
*NL*
till
night
.
They
could
always
talk
;
and
their
discourse
,
witty
,
pithy
,
*NL*
original
,
had
such
charms
for
me
,
that
I
preferred
listening
to
,
and
*NL*
sharing
in
it
,
to
doing
anything
else
.
St.
John
did
not
rebuke
our
*NL*
vivacity
;
but
he
escaped
from
it
:
he
was
seldom
in
the
house
;
his
parish
*NL*
was
large
,
the
population
scattered
,
and
he
found
daily
business
in
*NL*
visiting
the
sick
and
poor
in
its
different
districts
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
at
breakfast
,
Diana
,
after
looking
a
little
pensive
for
some
*NL*
minutes
,
asked
him
,
``
If
his
plans
were
yet
unchanged
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Unchanged
and
unchangeable
,
''
was
the
reply
.
And
he
proceeded
to
inform
*NL*
us
that
his
departure
from
England
was
now
definitively
fixed
for
the
*NL*
ensuing
year
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Rosamond
Oliver
?
''
suggested
Mary
,
the
words
seeming
to
escape
her
*NL*
lips
involuntarily
:
for
no
sooner
had
she
uttered
them
,
than
she
made
a
*NL*
gesture
as
if
wishing
to
recall
them
.
St.
John
had
a
book
in
his
hand
--
it
*NL*
was
his
unsocial
custom
to
read
at
meals
--
he
closed
it
,
and
looked
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rosamond
Oliver
,
''
said
he
,
``
is
about
to
be
married
to
Mr.
Granby
,
one
of
*NL*
the
best
connected
and
most
estimable
residents
in
S
-
,
grandson
and
heir
*NL*
to
Sir
Frederic
Granby
:
I
had
the
intelligence
from
her
father
*NL*
yesterday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
sisters
looked
at
each
other
and
at
me
;
we
all
three
looked
at
him
:
*NL*
he
was
serene
as
glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
match
must
have
been
got
up
hastily
,
''
said
Diana
:
``
they
can
not
have
*NL*
known
each
other
long
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
two
months
:
they
met
in
October
at
the
county
ball
at
S
-
.
But
where
*NL*
there
are
no
obstacles
to
a
union
,
as
in
the
present
case
,
where
the
*NL*
connection
is
in
every
point
desirable
,
delays
are
unnecessary
:
they
will
*NL*
be
married
as
soon
as
S
--
Place
,
which
Sir
Frederic
gives
up
to
them
,
*NL*
can
he
refitted
for
their
reception
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
time
I
found
St.
John
alone
after
this
communication
,
I
felt
*NL*
tempted
to
inquire
if
the
event
distressed
him
:
but
he
seemed
so
little
*NL*
to
need
sympathy
,
that
,
so
far
from
venturing
to
offer
him
more
,
I
*NL*
experienced
some
shame
at
the
recollection
of
what
I
had
already
*NL*
hazarded
.
Besides
,
I
was
out
of
practice
in
talking
to
him
:
his
reserve
*NL*
was
again
frozen
over
,
and
my
frankness
was
congealed
beneath
it
.
He
had
*NL*
not
kept
his
promise
of
treating
me
like
his
sisters
;
he
continually
made
*NL*
little
chilling
differences
between
us
,
which
did
not
at
all
tend
to
the
*NL*
development
of
cordiality
:
in
short
,
now
that
I
was
acknowledged
his
*NL*
kinswoman
,
and
lived
under
the
same
roof
with
him
,
I
felt
the
distance
*NL*
between
us
to
be
far
greater
than
when
he
had
known
me
only
as
the
*NL*
village
schoolmistress
.
When
I
remembered
how
far
I
had
once
been
*NL*
admitted
to
his
confidence
,
I
could
hardly
comprehend
his
present
*NL*
frigidity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
being
the
case
,
I
felt
not
a
little
surprised
when
he
raised
his
*NL*
head
suddenly
from
the
desk
over
which
he
was
stooping
,
and
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
Jane
,
the
battle
is
fought
and
the
victory
won
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Startled
at
being
thus
addressed
,
I
did
not
immediately
reply
:
after
a
*NL*
moment
's
hesitation
I
answered
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
are
you
sure
you
are
not
in
the
position
of
those
conquerors
whose
*NL*
triumphs
have
cost
them
too
dear
?
Would
not
such
another
ruin
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
not
;
and
if
I
were
,
it
does
not
much
signify
;
I
shall
never
be
*NL*
called
upon
to
contend
for
such
another
.
The
event
of
the
conflict
is
*NL*
decisive
:
my
way
is
now
clear
;
I
thank
God
for
it
!
''
So
saying
,
he
*NL*
returned
to
his
papers
and
his
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
our
mutual
happiness
-LRB-
_
i.e.
_
,
Diana
's
,
Mary
's
,
and
mine
-RRB-
settled
into
*NL*
a
quieter
character
,
and
we
resumed
our
usual
habits
and
regular
studies
,
*NL*
St.
John
stayed
more
at
home
:
he
sat
with
us
in
the
same
room
,
sometimes
*NL*
for
hours
together
.
While
Mary
drew
,
Diana
pursued
a
course
of
*NL*
encyclopaedic
reading
she
had
-LRB-
to
my
awe
and
amazement
-RRB-
undertaken
,
and
I
*NL*
fagged
away
at
German
,
he
pondered
a
mystic
lore
of
his
own
:
that
of
some
*NL*
Eastern
tongue
,
the
acquisition
of
which
he
thought
necessary
to
his
*NL*
plans
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
engaged
,
he
appeared
,
sitting
in
his
own
recess
,
quiet
and
absorbed
*NL*
enough
;
but
that
blue
eye
of
his
had
a
habit
of
leaving
the
outlandish
-
*NL*
looking
grammar
,
and
wandering
over
,
and
sometimes
fixing
upon
us
,
his
*NL*
fellow-students
,
with
a
curious
intensity
of
observation
:
if
caught
,
it
*NL*
would
be
instantly
withdrawn
;
yet
ever
and
anon
,
it
returned
searchingly
*NL*
to
our
table
.
I
wondered
what
it
meant
:
I
wondered
,
too
,
at
the
punctual
*NL*
satisfaction
he
never
failed
to
exhibit
on
an
occasion
that
seemed
to
me
*NL*
of
small
moment
,
namely
,
my
weekly
visit
to
Morton
school
;
and
still
more
*NL*
was
I
puzzled
when
,
if
the
day
was
unfavourable
,
if
there
was
snow
,
or
*NL*
rain
,
or
high
wind
,
and
his
sisters
urged
me
not
to
go
,
he
would
*NL*
invariably
make
light
of
their
solicitude
,
and
encourage
me
to
accomplish
*NL*
the
task
without
regard
to
the
elements
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jane
is
not
such
a
weakling
as
you
would
make
her
,
''
he
would
say
:
``
she
*NL*
can
bear
a
mountain
blast
,
or
a
shower
,
or
a
few
flakes
of
snow
,
as
well
*NL*
as
any
of
us
.
Her
constitution
is
both
sound
and
elastic
;
--
better
*NL*
calculated
to
endure
variations
of
climate
than
many
more
robust
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
when
I
returned
,
sometimes
a
good
deal
tired
,
and
not
a
little
*NL*
weather-beaten
,
I
never
dared
complain
,
because
I
saw
that
to
murmur
*NL*
would
be
to
vex
him
:
on
all
occasions
fortitude
pleased
him
;
the
reverse
*NL*
was
a
special
annoyance
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
afternoon
,
however
,
I
got
leave
to
stay
at
home
,
because
I
really
had
*NL*
a
cold
.
His
sisters
were
gone
to
Morton
in
my
stead
:
I
sat
reading
*NL*
Schiller
;
he
,
deciphering
his
crabbed
Oriental
scrolls
.
As
I
exchanged
a
*NL*
translation
for
an
exercise
,
I
happened
to
look
his
way
:
there
I
found
*NL*
myself
under
the
influence
of
the
ever-watchful
blue
eye
.
How
long
it
*NL*
had
been
searching
me
through
and
through
,
and
over
and
over
,
I
can
not
*NL*
tell
:
so
keen
was
it
,
and
yet
so
cold
,
I
felt
for
the
moment
*NL*
superstitious
--
as
if
I
were
sitting
in
the
room
with
something
uncanny
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jane
,
what
are
you
doing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Learning
German
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
you
to
give
up
German
and
learn
Hindostanee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
in
earnest
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
such
earnest
that
I
must
have
it
so
:
and
I
will
tell
you
why
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
then
went
on
to
explain
that
Hindostanee
was
the
language
he
was
*NL*
himself
at
present
studying
;
that
,
as
he
advanced
,
he
was
apt
to
forget
*NL*
the
commencement
;
that
it
would
assist
him
greatly
to
have
a
pupil
with
*NL*
whom
he
might
again
and
again
go
over
the
elements
,
and
so
fix
them
*NL*
thoroughly
in
his
mind
;
that
his
choice
had
hovered
for
some
time
between
*NL*
me
and
his
sisters
;
but
that
he
had
fixed
on
me
because
he
saw
I
could
*NL*
sit
at
a
task
the
longest
of
the
three
.
Would
I
do
him
this
favour
?
I
*NL*
should
not
,
perhaps
,
have
to
make
the
sacrifice
long
,
as
it
wanted
now
*NL*
barely
three
months
to
his
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
St.
John
was
not
a
man
to
be
lightly
refused
:
you
felt
that
every
*NL*
impression
made
on
him
,
either
for
pain
or
pleasure
,
was
deep-graved
and
*NL*
permanent
.
I
consented
.
When
Diana
and
Mary
returned
,
the
former
found
*NL*
her
scholar
transferred
from
her
to
her
brother
:
she
laughed
,
and
both
*NL*
she
and
Mary
agreed
that
St.
John
should
never
have
persuaded
them
to
*NL*
such
a
step
.
He
answered
quietly
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
found
him
a
very
patient
,
very
forbearing
,
and
yet
an
exacting
master
:
*NL*
he
expected
me
to
do
a
great
deal
;
and
when
I
fulfilled
his
expectations
,
*NL*
he
,
in
his
own
way
,
fully
testified
his
approbation
.
By
degrees
,
he
*NL*
acquired
a
certain
influence
over
me
that
took
away
my
liberty
of
mind
:
*NL*
his
praise
and
notice
were
more
restraining
than
his
indifference
.
I
*NL*
could
no
longer
talk
or
laugh
freely
when
he
was
by
,
because
a
tiresomely
*NL*
importunate
instinct
reminded
me
that
vivacity
-LRB-
at
least
in
me
-RRB-
was
*NL*
distasteful
to
him
.
I
was
so
fully
aware
that
only
serious
moods
and
*NL*
occupations
were
acceptable
,
that
in
his
presence
every
effort
to
sustain
*NL*
or
follow
any
other
became
vain
:
I
fell
under
a
freezing
spell
.
When
he
*NL*
said
``
go
,
''
I
went
;
``
come
,
''
I
came
;
``
do
this
,
''
I
did
it
.
But
I
did
not
*NL*
love
my
servitude
:
I
wished
,
many
a
time
,
he
had
continued
to
neglect
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
when
,
at
bedtime
,
his
sisters
and
I
stood
round
him
,
bidding
*NL*
him
good-night
,
he
kissed
each
of
them
,
as
was
his
custom
;
and
,
as
was
*NL*
equally
his
custom
,
he
gave
me
his
hand
.
Diana
,
who
chanced
to
be
in
a
*NL*
frolicsome
humour
-LRB-
_
she
_
was
not
painfully
controlled
by
his
will
;
for
*NL*
hers
,
in
another
way
,
was
as
strong
-RRB-
,
exclaimed
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
St.
John
!
you
used
to
call
Jane
your
third
sister
,
but
you
do
n't
treat
*NL*
her
as
such
:
you
should
kiss
her
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
pushed
me
towards
him
.
I
thought
Diana
very
provoking
,
and
felt
*NL*
uncomfortably
confused
;
and
while
I
was
thus
thinking
and
feeling
,
St.
*NL*
John
bent
his
head
;
his
Greek
face
was
brought
to
a
level
with
mine
,
his
*NL*
eyes
questioned
my
eyes
piercingly
--
he
kissed
me
.
There
are
no
such
*NL*
things
as
marble
kisses
or
ice
kisses
,
or
I
should
say
my
ecclesiastical
*NL*
cousin
's
salute
belonged
to
one
of
these
classes
;
but
there
may
be
*NL*
experiment
kisses
,
and
his
was
an
experiment
kiss
.
When
given
,
he
viewed
*NL*
me
to
learn
the
result
;
it
was
not
striking
:
I
am
sure
I
did
not
blush
;
*NL*
perhaps
I
might
have
turned
a
little
pale
,
for
I
felt
as
if
this
kiss
*NL*
were
a
seal
affixed
to
my
fetters
.
He
never
omitted
the
ceremony
*NL*
afterwards
,
and
the
gravity
and
quiescence
with
which
I
underwent
it
,
*NL*
seemed
to
invest
it
for
him
with
a
certain
charm
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
me
,
I
daily
wished
more
to
please
him
;
but
to
do
so
,
I
felt
daily
*NL*
more
and
more
that
I
must
disown
half
my
nature
,
stifle
half
my
*NL*
faculties
,
wrest
my
tastes
from
their
original
bent
,
force
myself
to
the
*NL*
adoption
of
pursuits
for
which
I
had
no
natural
vocation
.
He
wanted
to
*NL*
train
me
to
an
elevation
I
could
never
reach
;
it
racked
me
hourly
to
*NL*
aspire
to
the
standard
he
uplifted
.
The
thing
was
as
impossible
as
to
*NL*
mould
my
irregular
features
to
his
correct
and
classic
pattern
,
to
give
*NL*
to
my
changeable
green
eyes
the
sea-blue
tint
and
solemn
lustre
of
his
*NL*
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
his
ascendancy
alone
,
however
,
held
me
in
thrall
at
present
.
Of
late
*NL*
it
had
been
easy
enough
for
me
to
look
sad
:
a
cankering
evil
sat
at
my
*NL*
heart
and
drained
my
happiness
at
its
source
--
the
evil
of
suspense
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
you
think
I
had
forgotten
Mr.
Rochester
,
reader
,
amidst
these
*NL*
changes
of
place
and
fortune
.
Not
for
a
moment
.
His
idea
was
still
with
*NL*
me
,
because
it
was
not
a
vapour
sunshine
could
disperse
,
nor
a
*NL*
sand-traced
effigy
storms
could
wash
away
;
it
was
a
name
graven
on
a
*NL*
tablet
,
fated
to
last
as
long
as
the
marble
it
inscribed
.
The
craving
to
*NL*
know
what
had
become
of
him
followed
me
everywhere
;
when
I
was
at
Morton
,
*NL*
I
re-entered
my
cottage
every
evening
to
think
of
that
;
and
now
at
Moor
*NL*
House
,
I
sought
my
bedroom
each
night
to
brood
over
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
course
of
my
necessary
correspondence
with
Mr.
Briggs
about
the
*NL*
will
,
I
had
inquired
if
he
knew
anything
of
Mr.
Rochester
's
present
*NL*
residence
and
state
of
health
;
but
,
as
St.
John
had
conjectured
,
he
was
*NL*
quite
ignorant
of
all
concerning
him
.
I
then
wrote
to
Mrs.
Fairfax
,
*NL*
entreating
information
on
the
subject
.
I
had
calculated
with
certainty
*NL*
on
this
step
answering
my
end
:
I
felt
sure
it
would
elicit
an
early
*NL*
answer
.
I
was
astonished
when
a
fortnight
passed
without
reply
;
but
when
*NL*
two
months
wore
away
,
and
day
after
day
the
post
arrived
and
brought
*NL*
nothing
for
me
,
I
fell
a
prey
to
the
keenest
anxiety
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
wrote
again
:
there
was
a
chance
of
my
first
letter
having
missed
.
*NL*
Renewed
hope
followed
renewed
effort
:
it
shone
like
the
former
for
some
*NL*
weeks
,
then
,
like
it
,
it
faded
,
flickered
:
not
a
line
,
not
a
word
reached
*NL*
me
.
When
half
a
year
wasted
in
vain
expectancy
,
my
hope
died
out
,
and
*NL*
then
I
felt
dark
indeed
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
fine
spring
shone
round
me
,
which
I
could
not
enjoy
.
Summer
*NL*
approached
;
Diana
tried
to
cheer
me
:
she
said
I
looked
ill
,
and
wished
to
*NL*
accompany
me
to
the
sea-side
.
This
St.
John
opposed
;
he
said
I
did
not
*NL*
want
dissipation
,
I
wanted
employment
;
my
present
life
was
too
*NL*
purposeless
,
I
required
an
aim
;
and
,
I
suppose
,
by
way
of
supplying
*NL*
deficiencies
,
he
prolonged
still
further
my
lessons
in
Hindostanee
,
and
*NL*
grew
more
urgent
in
requiring
their
accomplishment
:
and
I
,
like
a
fool
,
*NL*
never
thought
of
resisting
him
--
I
could
not
resist
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
I
had
come
to
my
studies
in
lower
spirits
than
usual
;
the
ebb
was
*NL*
occasioned
by
a
poignantly
felt
disappointment
.
Hannah
had
told
me
in
*NL*
the
morning
there
was
a
letter
for
me
,
and
when
I
went
down
to
take
it
,
*NL*
almost
certain
that
the
long-looked
for
tidings
were
vouchsafed
me
at
*NL*
last
,
I
found
only
an
unimportant
note
from
Mr.
Briggs
on
business
.
The
*NL*
bitter
check
had
wrung
from
me
some
tears
;
and
now
,
as
I
sat
poring
over
*NL*
the
crabbed
characters
and
flourishing
tropes
of
an
Indian
scribe
,
my
*NL*
eyes
filled
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
St.
John
called
me
to
his
side
to
read
;
in
attempting
to
do
this
my
voice
*NL*
failed
me
:
words
were
lost
in
sobs
.
He
and
I
were
the
only
occupants
of
*NL*
the
parlour
:
Diana
was
practising
her
music
in
the
drawing-room
,
Mary
was
*NL*
gardening
--
it
was
a
very
fine
May
day
,
clear
,
sunny
,
and
breezy
.
My
*NL*
companion
expressed
no
surprise
at
this
emotion
,
nor
did
he
question
me
*NL*
as
to
its
cause
;
he
only
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
will
wait
a
few
minutes
,
Jane
,
till
you
are
more
composed
.
''
And
*NL*
while
I
smothered
the
paroxysm
with
all
haste
,
he
sat
calm
and
patient
,
*NL*
leaning
on
his
desk
,
and
looking
like
a
physician
watching
with
the
eye
*NL*
of
science
an
expected
and
fully
understood
crisis
in
a
patient
's
malady
.
*NL*
Having
stifled
my
sobs
,
wiped
my
eyes
,
and
muttered
something
about
not
*NL*
being
very
well
that
morning
,
I
resumed
my
task
,
and
succeeded
in
*NL*
completing
it
.
St.
John
put
away
my
books
and
his
,
locked
his
desk
,
and
*NL*
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Jane
,
you
shall
take
a
walk
;
and
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
call
Diana
and
Mary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
want
only
one
companion
this
morning
,
and
that
must
be
you
.
Put
*NL*
on
your
things
;
go
out
by
the
kitchen-door
:
take
the
road
towards
the
*NL*
head
of
Marsh
Glen
:
I
will
join
you
in
a
moment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
know
no
medium
:
I
never
in
my
life
have
known
any
medium
in
my
dealings
*NL*
with
positive
,
hard
characters
,
antagonistic
to
my
own
,
between
absolute
*NL*
submission
and
determined
revolt
.
I
have
always
faithfully
observed
the
*NL*
one
,
up
to
the
very
moment
of
bursting
,
sometimes
with
volcanic
*NL*
vehemence
,
into
the
other
;
and
as
neither
present
circumstances
*NL*
warranted
,
nor
my
present
mood
inclined
me
to
mutiny
,
I
observed
careful
*NL*
obedience
to
St.
John
's
directions
;
and
in
ten
minutes
I
was
treading
the
*NL*
wild
track
of
the
glen
,
side
by
side
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
breeze
was
from
the
west
:
it
came
over
the
hills
,
sweet
with
scents
*NL*
of
heath
and
rush
;
the
sky
was
of
stainless
blue
;
the
stream
descending
*NL*
the
ravine
,
swelled
with
past
spring
rains
,
poured
along
plentiful
and
*NL*
clear
,
catching
golden
gleams
from
the
sun
,
and
sapphire
tints
from
the
*NL*
firmament
.
As
we
advanced
and
left
the
track
,
we
trod
a
soft
turf
,
mossy
*NL*
fine
and
emerald
green
,
minutely
enamelled
with
a
tiny
white
flower
,
and
*NL*
spangled
with
a
star-like
yellow
blossom
:
the
hills
,
meantime
,
shut
us
*NL*
quite
in
;
for
the
glen
,
towards
its
head
,
wound
to
their
very
core
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
rest
here
,
''
said
St.
John
,
as
we
reached
the
first
stragglers
of
*NL*
a
battalion
of
rocks
,
guarding
a
sort
of
pass
,
beyond
which
the
beck
*NL*
rushed
down
a
waterfall
;
and
where
,
still
a
little
farther
,
the
mountain
*NL*
shook
off
turf
and
flower
,
had
only
heath
for
raiment
and
crag
for
*NL*
gem
--
where
it
exaggerated
the
wild
to
the
savage
,
and
exchanged
the
fresh
*NL*
for
the
frowning
--
where
it
guarded
the
forlorn
hope
of
solitude
,
and
a
*NL*
last
refuge
for
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
a
seat
:
St.
John
stood
near
me
.
He
looked
up
the
pass
and
down
*NL*
the
hollow
;
his
glance
wandered
away
with
the
stream
,
and
returned
to
*NL*
traverse
the
unclouded
heaven
which
coloured
it
:
he
removed
his
hat
,
let
*NL*
the
breeze
stir
his
hair
and
kiss
his
brow
.
He
seemed
in
communion
with
*NL*
the
genius
of
the
haunt
:
with
his
eye
he
bade
farewell
to
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
shall
see
it
again
,
''
he
said
aloud
,
``
in
dreams
when
I
sleep
by
the
*NL*
Ganges
:
and
again
in
a
more
remote
hour
--
when
another
slumber
overcomes
*NL*
me
--
on
the
shore
of
a
darker
stream
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strange
words
of
a
strange
love
!
An
austere
patriot
's
passion
for
his
*NL*
fatherland
!
He
sat
down
;
for
half-an-hour
we
never
spoke
;
neither
he
to
*NL*
me
nor
I
to
him
:
that
interval
past
,
he
recommenced
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jane
,
I
go
in
six
weeks
;
I
have
taken
my
berth
in
an
East
Indiaman
which
*NL*
sails
on
the
20th
of
June
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
will
protect
you
;
for
you
have
undertaken
His
work
,
''
I
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
he
,
``
there
is
my
glory
and
joy

I
am
the

an
*NL*
infallible
Master

going
out
under
human
guidance

the
defective
laws

erring
control
of
my
feeble
fellow-worms

my
king

It

strange
to
me
that

all
round
me
do
not
burn
to
enlist
under
the
same
banner
,

to
join
in
the
*NL*

enterprise

*NL*
*NL*
``
All

your

be

strong

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
speak

think
of

I
address
only

*NL*
``

difficult

*NL*
``
You
say
truly

when
found

up

them
to
the
effort

*NL*
``
If

of
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
as
if
an
awful
charm
was
framing
round
and
gathering
over
me
:
I
*NL*
trembled
to
hear
some
fatal
word
spoken
which
would
at
once
declare
and
*NL*
rivet
the
spell

*NL*
``

heart

demanded
St.

.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My

is
mute

my
heart
is
mute

I
answered
,
struck
and
thrilled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
must
speak
for
it
,

continued
the
deep
,
relentless
voice
.
``
Jane

come
with
me
to
India

as
my
helpmeet

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
glen
and
sky
spun
round
:
the
hills
heaved
!
It
was
as
if
I
had
heard
*NL*
a
summons
from
Heaven
--
as
if
a
visionary
messenger
,
like
him
of
*NL*
Macedonia
,
had
enounced
,
``
Come
over
and
help
us
!
''
But
I
was
no
*NL*
apostle
,
--
I
could
not
behold
the
herald
,
--
I
could
not
receive
his
call
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
St.
John
!
''
I
cried
,
``
have
some
mercy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
appealed
to
one
who
,
in
the
discharge
of
what
he
believed
his
duty
,
*NL*
knew
neither
mercy
nor
remorse
.
He
continued
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
and
nature
intended
you
for
a
missionary
's
wife

It
is
not
*NL*
personal

mental

they
have
given
you
:
you
are
formed
for
*NL*
labour
,
not
for
love

A
missionary
's
wife
you
must

shall
be

You
shall

be
mine

I
claim
you

for
my
Sovereign
's

service

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
fit
for
it
:
I
have
no

I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
calculated
on
these
first
objections
:
he
was
not
irritated
by
*NL*
them
.
Indeed
,
as
he
leaned
back
against
the
crag
behind
him
,
folded
his
*NL*
arms
on
his
chest
,
and
fixed
his
countenance
,
I
saw
he
was
prepared
for
a
*NL*
long
and
trying
opposition
,
and
had
taken
in
a
stock
of
patience
to
last
*NL*
him
to
its
close
--
resolved
,
however
,
that
that
close
should
be
conquest
*NL*
for
him

*NL*
*NL*
``
Humility
,
Jane

''
said
he
,
``
is
the
groundwork
of
Christian
virtues

you
*NL*
say
right
that
you
are
not
fit
for

Who
is
fit
for
it
?
Or
who
,
*NL*
that
ever
was
truly
called
,
believed
himself
worthy
of
the
summons
?
I
,
*NL*
for
instance
,
am
but
dust
and
ashes
.
With
St.
Paul
,
I
acknowledge
myself
*NL*
the
chiefest
of
sinners
;
but
I
do
not
suffer
this
sense
of
my
personal
*NL*
vileness
to
daunt
me
.
I
know
my
Leader
:
that
He
is
just
as
well
as
*NL*
mighty
;
and
while
He
has
chosen
a
feeble
instrument
to
perform
a
great
*NL*
task
,
He
will
,
from
the
boundless
stores
of
His
providence
,
supply
the
*NL*
inadequacy
of
the
means
to
the
end

Think
like
me
,
Jane

trust
like
me

*NL*
It
is
the
Rock
of
Ages
I
ask
you
to
lean
on
:
do
not
doubt
but
it
will
*NL*
bear
the
weight
of
your
human
weakness

*NL*
``
I
do
not
understand

``
There

I

your

from

stand
by
you
always

help
you
from

This
I
could
do
in
the
beginning
:
soon
-LRB-
for
I
know
your
powers

you
would
be
as
strong

myself

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
my
powers

where
are
they
for
this
undertaking

I
do
not

Nothing

I
am
sensible

no

I
*NL*
wish
I
could
make
you
see
how
much
my
mind
is
at
this
moment
like
a
*NL*
rayless
dungeon
,
with
one
shrinking
fear
fettered
in
its
depths
--
the
fear
*NL*
of
being
persuaded
by
you
to
attempt
what
I
can
not
accomplish
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
an
answer
for
you
--
hear
it
.
I
have
watched
you
ever
since
we
*NL*
first
met
:
I
have
made
you
my
study
for
ten
months
.
I
have
proved
you
in
*NL*
that
time
by
sundry
tests
:
and
what
have
I
seen
and
elicited
?
In
the
*NL*
village
school
I
found
you
could
perform
well
,
punctually
,
uprightly
,
*NL*
labour
uncongenial
to
your
habits
and
inclinations
;
I
saw
you
could
*NL*
perform
it
with
capacity
and
tact
:
you
could
win
while
you
controlled
.
In
*NL*
the
calm
with
which
you
learnt
you
had
become
suddenly
rich
,
I
read
a
*NL*
mind
clear
of
the
vice
of
Demas
:
--
lucre
had
no
undue
power
over
you
.
In
*NL*
the
resolute
readiness
with
which
you
cut
your
wealth
into
four
shares
,
*NL*
keeping
but
one
to
yourself
,
and
relinquishing
the
three
others
to
the
*NL*
claim
of
abstract
justice
,
I
recognised
a
soul
that
revelled
in
the
flame
*NL*
and
excitement
of
sacrifice
.
In
the
tractability
with
which
,
at
my
wish
,
*NL*
you
forsook
a
study
in
which
you
were
interested
,
and
adopted
another
*NL*
because
it
interested
me
;
in
the
untiring
assiduity
with
which
you
have
*NL*
since
persevered
in
it
--
in
the
unflagging
energy
and
unshaken
temper
with
*NL*
which
you
have
met
its
difficulties
--
I
acknowledge
the
complement
of
the
*NL*
qualities
I
seek
.
Jane
,
you
are
docile
,
diligent
,
disinterested
,
*NL*
faithful
,
constant
,
and
courageous
;
very
gentle
,
and
very
heroic
:
cease
*NL*
to
mistrust
yourself
--
I
can
trust
you
unreservedly
.
As
a
conductress
of
*NL*
Indian
schools
,
and
a
helper
amongst
Indian
women
,
your
assistance
will
*NL*
be
to
me
invaluable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
iron
shroud
contracted
round
me
;
persuasion
advanced
with
slow
sure
*NL*
step
.
Shut
my
eyes
as
I
would
,
these
last
words
of
his
succeeded
in
*NL*
making
the
way
,
which
had
seemed
blocked
up
,
comparatively
clear
.
My
*NL*
work
,
which
had
appeared
so
vague
,
so
hopelessly
diffuse
,
condensed
*NL*
itself
as
he
proceeded
,
and
assumed
a
definite
form
under
his
shaping
*NL*
hand
.
He
waited
for
an
answer
.
I
demanded
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
*NL*
think
,
before
I
again
hazarded
a
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
willingly

''
he
rejoined
;
and
rising
,
he
strode
a
little
distance
up
*NL*
the
pass
,
threw
himself
down
on
a
swell
of
heath
,
and
there
lay
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LCB-
He
threw
himself
down
on
a
swell
of
heath
,
and
there
lay
still
:

-RCB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
_
can
_
do
what
he
wants
me
to
do
:
I
am
forced
to
see
and
acknowledge
*NL*
that
,
''
I
meditated
,
--
``
that
is
,
if
life
be
spared
me
.
But
I
feel
mine
is
*NL*
not
the
existence
to
be
long
protracted
under
an
Indian
sun
.
What
then
?
*NL*
He
does
not
care
for
that
:
when
my
time
came
to
die
,
he
would
resign
me
,
*NL*
in
all
serenity
and
sanctity
,
to
the
God
who
gave
me
.
The
case
is
very
*NL*
plain
before
me
.
In
leaving
England
,
I
should
leave
a
loved
but
empty
*NL*
land
--
Mr.
Rochester
is
not
there
;
and
if
he
were
,
what
is
,
what
can
that
*NL*
ever
be
to
me
?
My
business
is
to
live
without
him
now
:
nothing
so
*NL*
absurd
,
so
weak
as
to
drag
on
from
day
to
day
,
as
if
I
were
waiting
some
*NL*
impossible
change
in
circumstances
,
which
might
reunite
me
to
him
.
Of
*NL*
course
-LRB-
as
St.
John
once
said
-RRB-
I
must
seek
another
interest
in
life
to
*NL*
replace
the
one
lost
:
is
not
the
occupation
he
now
offers
me
truly
the
*NL*
most
glorious
man
can
adopt
or
God
assign
?
Is
it
not
,
by
its
noble
cares
*NL*
and
sublime
results
,
the
one
best
calculated
to
fill
the
void
left
by
*NL*
uptorn
affections
and
demolished
hopes
?
I
believe
I
must
say
,
Yes
--
and
*NL*
yet
I
shudder
.
Alas
!
If
I
join
St.
John
,
I
abandon
half
myself
:
if
I
go
*NL*
to
India
,
I
go
to
premature
death
.
And
how
will
the
interval
between
*NL*
leaving
England
for
India
,
and
India
for
the
grave
,
be
filled
?
Oh
,
I
*NL*
know
well
!
That
,
too
,
is
very
clear
to
my
vision
.
By
straining
to
*NL*
satisfy
St.
John
till
my
sinews
ache
,
I
_
shall
_
satisfy
him
--
to
the
*NL*
finest
central
point
and
farthest
outward
circle
of
his
expectations
.
If
*NL*
I
_
do
_
go
with
him
--
if
I
_
do
_
make
the
sacrifice
he
urges
,
I
will
make
it
*NL*
absolutely
:
I
will
throw
all
on
the
altar
--
heart
,
vitals
,
the
entire
*NL*
victim
.
He
will
never
love
me
;
but
he
shall
approve
me
;
I
will
show
him
*NL*
energies
he
has
not
yet
seen
,
resources
he
has
never
suspected
.
Yes
,
I
*NL*
can
work
as
hard
as
he
can
,
and
with
as
little
grudging
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Consent
,
then
,
to
his
demand
is
possible
:
but
for
one
item
--
one
dreadful
*NL*
item
.
It
is
--
that
he
asks
me
to
be
his
wife
,
and
has
no
more
of
a
*NL*
husband
's
heart
for
me
than
that
frowning
giant
of
a
rock
,
down
which
the
*NL*
stream
is
foaming
in
yonder
gorge
.
He
prizes
me
as
a
soldier
would
a
*NL*
good
weapon
;
and
that
is
all
.
Unmarried
to
him
,
this
would
never
grieve
*NL*
me
;
but
can
I
let
him
complete
his
calculations
--
coolly
put
into
practice
*NL*
his
plans
--
go
through
the
wedding
ceremony
?
Can
I
receive
from
him
the
*NL*
bridal
ring
,
endure
all
the
forms
of
love
-LRB-
which
I
doubt
not
he
would
*NL*
scrupulously
observe
-RRB-
and
know
that
the
spirit
was
quite
absent
?
Can
I
*NL*
bear
the
consciousness
that
every
endearment
he
bestows
is
a
sacrifice
*NL*
made
on
principle
?
No
:
such
a
martyrdom
would
be
monstrous
.
I
will
*NL*
never
undergo
it
.
As
his
sister
,
I
might
accompany
him
--
not
as
his
wife
:
*NL*
I
will
tell
him
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
looked
towards
the
knoll
:
there
he
lay
,
still
as
a
prostrate
column
;
*NL*
his
face
turned
to
me
:
his
eye
beaming
watchful
and
keen
.
He
started
to
*NL*
his
feet
and
approached
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
ready
to
go
to
India
,
if
I
may
go
free

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
answer
requires
a
commentary

he
said
;
``
it
is
not
clear

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
hitherto
been

He
shook
his
head

``
Adopted

not

I
should
take
you

seek
no

But
as
it
is

either
our
union
must
be
consecrated

sealed
by
*NL*
marriage

or
it
can
not
exist

practical
obstacles
oppose
themselves

Do

not

Consider
a
moment

strong

guide
you

*NL*
*NL*
I
did
consider
;
and
still
my
sense
,
such
as
it
was
,
directed
me
only
to
*NL*
the
fact
that
we
did
not
love
each
other
as
man
and
wife
should
:
and
*NL*
therefore
it
inferred
we
ought
not
to
marry

said
so

returned

``

sharp

the

me
in
my
future
labours

you
do
not

have

one

with
power

To
do
so

must
have
a
coadjutor

not
a

that

is
a
loose
tie

I
,
too

do
not
want
a

a

*NL*
might
any
day
be
taken
from
me

I
want

shuddered

will
not

that
there
was
not
something
of
repressed

sarcasm
both
in
the
tone
in
which
I
uttered
this
sentence
,
and
in
the
*NL*
feeling
that
accompanied
it

I
had
silently
feared
St.
John
till
now
,
*NL*
because
I
had
not
understood
him
.
He
had
held
me
in
awe
,
because
he
had
*NL*
held
me
in
doubt
.
How
much
of
him
was
saint
,
how
much
mortal
,
I
could
*NL*
not
heretofore
tell
:
but
revelations
were
being
made
in
this
conference
:
*NL*
the
analysis
of
his
nature
was
proceeding
before
my
eyes
.
I
saw
his
*NL*
fallibilities
:
I
comprehended
them
.
I
understood
that
,
sitting
there
*NL*
where
I
did
,
on
the
bank
of
heath
,
and
with
that
handsome
form
before
me
,
*NL*
I
sat
at
the
feet
of
a
man
,
caring
as
I
.
The
veil
fell
from
his
hardness
*NL*
and
despotism
.
Having
felt
in
him
the
presence
of
these
qualities
,
I
*NL*
felt
his
imperfection
and
took
courage
.
I
was
with
an
equal
--
one
with
*NL*
whom
I
might
argue
--
one
whom
,
if
I
saw
good
,
I
might
resist
.

*NL*
He
was
silent
after
I
had
uttered
the
last
sentence
,
and
I
presently
*NL*
risked
an
upward
glance
at
his
countenance
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
eye
,
bent
on
me
,
expressed
at
once
stern
surprise
and
keen
inquiry
.
*NL*
``
Is
she
sarcastic
,
and
sarcastic
to
_
me
_
!
''
it
seemed
to
say
.
``
What
does
*NL*
this
signify
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
let
us
forget
that
this
is
a
solemn
matter
,
''
he
said
ere
long
;
*NL*
``
one
of
which
we
may
neither
think
nor
talk
lightly
without
sin
.
I
*NL*
trust
,
Jane
,
you
are
in
earnest
when
you
say
you
will
serve
your
heart
to
*NL*
God
:
it
is
all
I
want
.
Once
wrench
your
heart
from
man
,
and
fix
it
on
*NL*
your
Maker
,
the
advancement
of
that
Maker
's
spiritual
kingdom
on
earth
*NL*
will
be
your
chief
delight
and
endeavour
;
you
will
be
ready
to
do
at
once
*NL*
whatever
furthers
that
end
.
You
will
see
what
impetus
would
be
given
to
*NL*
your
efforts
and
mine
by
our
physical
and
mental
union
in
marriage
:
the
*NL*
only
union
that
gives
a
character
of
permanent
conformity
to
the
*NL*
destinies
and
designs
of
human
beings
;
and
,
passing
over
all
minor
*NL*
caprices
--
all
trivial
difficulties
and
delicacies
of
feeling
--
all
scruple
*NL*
about
the
degree
,
kind
,
strength
or
tenderness
of
mere
personal
*NL*
inclination
--
you
will
hasten
to
enter
into
that
union
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
?
''
I
said
briefly
;
and
I
looked
at
his
features
,
beautiful
in
*NL*
their
harmony
,
but
strangely
formidable
in
their
still
severity
;
at
his
*NL*
brow
,
commanding
but
not
open
;
at
his
eyes
,
bright
and
deep
and
*NL*
searching
,
but
never
soft
;
at
his
tall
imposing
figure
;
and
fancied
*NL*
myself
in
idea
_
his
wife
_
.
Oh
!
it
would
never
do
!
As
his
curate
,
his
*NL*
comrade
,
all
would
be
right
:
I
would
cross
oceans
with
him
in
that
*NL*
capacity
;
toil
under
Eastern
suns
,
in
Asian
deserts
with
him
in
that
*NL*
office
;
admire
and
emulate
his
courage
and
devotion
and
vigour
;
*NL*
accommodate
quietly
to
his
masterhood
;
smile
undisturbed
at
his
*NL*
ineradicable
ambition
;
discriminate
the
Christian
from
the
man
:
*NL*
profoundly
esteem
the
one
,
and
freely
forgive
the
other
.
I
should
suffer
*NL*
often
,
no
doubt
,
attached
to
him
only
in
this
capacity
:
my
body
would
be
*NL*
under
rather
a
stringent
yoke
,
but
my
heart
and
mind
would
be
free
.
I
*NL*
should
still
have
my
unblighted
self
to
turn
to
:
my
natural
unenslaved
*NL*
feelings
with
which
to
communicate
in
moments
of
loneliness
.
There
would
*NL*
be
recesses
in
my
mind
which
would
be
only
mine
,
to
which
he
never
came
,
*NL*
and
sentiments
growing
there
fresh
and
sheltered
which
his
austerity
*NL*
could
never
blight
,
nor
his
measured
warrior-march
trample
down
:
but
as
*NL*
his
wife
--
at
his
side
always
,
and
always
restrained
,
and
always
*NL*
checked
--
forced
to
keep
the
fire
of
my
nature
continually
low
,
to
compel
*NL*
it
to
burn
inwardly
and
never
utter
a
cry
,
though
the
imprisoned
flame
*NL*
consumed
vital
after
vital
--
_
this
_
would
be
unendurable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
St.
John
!
''
I
exclaimed
,
when
I
had
got
so
far
in
my
meditation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
he
answered
icily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
repeat
I
freely
consent
to
go
with
you
as
your
fellow-missionary
,
but
*NL*
not
as
your
wife
;
I
can
not
marry
you
and
become
part
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
part
of
me
you
must
become
,
''
he
answered
steadily
;
``
otherwise
the
*NL*
whole
bargain
is
void
.
How
can
I
,
a
man
not
yet
thirty
,
take
out
with
me
*NL*
to
India
a
girl
of
nineteen
,
unless
she
be
married
to
me
?
How
can
we
be
*NL*
for
ever
together
--
sometimes
in
solitudes
,
sometimes
amidst
savage
*NL*
tribes
--
and
unwed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
I
said
shortly
;
``
under
the
circumstances
,
quite
as
well
as
*NL*
if
I
were
either
your
real
sister
,
or
a
man
and
a
clergyman
like
*NL*
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
known
that
you
are
not
my
sister
;
I
can
not
introduce
you
as
such
:
*NL*
to
attempt
it
would
be
to
fasten
injurious
suspicions
on
us
both
.
And
*NL*
for
the
rest
,
though
you
have
a
man
's
vigorous
brain
,
you
have
a
woman
's
*NL*
heart
and
--
it
would
not
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
do
,
''
I
affirmed
with
some
disdain
,
``
perfectly
well
.
I
have
a
*NL*
woman
's
heart
,
but
not
where
you
are
concerned
;
for
you
I
have
only
a
*NL*
comrade
's
constancy
;
a
fellow-soldier
's
frankness
,
fidelity
,
fraternity
,
*NL*
if
you
like
;
a
neophyte
's
respect
and
submission
to
his
hierophant
:
*NL*
nothing
more
--
do
n't
fear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
what
I
want
,
''
he
said
,
speaking
to
himself
;
``
it
is
just
what
I
*NL*
want
.
And
there
are
obstacles
in
the
way
:
they
must
be
hewn
down
.
Jane
,
*NL*
you
would
not
repent
marrying
me
--
be
certain
of
that
;
we
_
must
_
be
*NL*
married
.
I
repeat
it
:
there
is
no
other
way
;
and
undoubtedly
enough
of
*NL*
love
would
follow
upon
marriage
to
render
the
union
right
even
in
your
*NL*
eyes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
scorn
your
idea
of
love
,
''
I
could
not
help
saying
,
as
I
rose
up
and
*NL*
stood
before
him
,
leaning
my
back
against
the
rock
.
``
I
scorn
the
*NL*
counterfeit
sentiment
you
offer
:
yes
,
St.
John
,
and
I
scorn
you
when
you
*NL*
offer
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
me
fixedly
,
compressing
his
well-cut
lips
while
he
did
so
.
*NL*
Whether
he
was
incensed
or
surprised
,
or
what
,
it
was
not
easy
to
tell
:
*NL*
he
could
command
his
countenance
thoroughly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
scarcely
expected
to
hear
that
expression
from
you
,
''
he
said
:
``
I
think
*NL*
I
have
done
and
uttered
nothing
to
deserve
scorn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
touched
by
his
gentle
tone
,
and
overawed
by
his
high
,
calm
mien
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forgive
me
the
words
,
St.
John
;
but
it
is
your
own
fault
that
I
have
*NL*
been
roused
to
speak
so
unguardedly
.
You
have
introduced
a
topic
on
*NL*
which
our
natures
are
at
variance
--
a
topic
we
should
never
discuss
:
the
*NL*
very
name
of
love
is
an
apple
of
discord
between
us
.
If
the
reality
were
*NL*
required
,
what
should
we
do
?
How
should
we
feel
?
My
dear
cousin
,
*NL*
abandon
your
scheme
of
marriage
--
forget
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
he
;
``
it
is
a
long-cherished
scheme
,
and
the
only
one
which
can
*NL*
secure
my
great
end
:
but
I
shall
urge
you
no
further
at
present
.
*NL*
To-morrow
,
I
leave
home
for
Cambridge
:
I
have
many
friends
there
to
whom
*NL*
I
should
wish
to
say
farewell
.
I
shall
be
absent
a
fortnight
--
take
that
*NL*
space
of
time
to
consider
my
offer
:
and
do
not
forget
that
if
you
reject
*NL*
it
,
it
is
not
me
you
deny
,
but
God
.
Through
my
means
,
He
opens
to
you
a
*NL*
noble
career
;
as
my
wife
only
can
you
enter
upon
it
.
Refuse
to
be
my
*NL*
wife
,
and
you
limit
yourself
for
ever
to
a
track
of
selfish
ease
and
*NL*
barren
obscurity
.
Tremble
lest
in
that
case
you
should
be
numbered
with
*NL*
those
who
have
denied
the
faith
,
and
are
worse
than
infidels
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
done
.
Turning
from
me
,
he
once
more
*NL*
*NL*
``
Looked
to
river
,
looked
to
hill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
time
his
feelings
were
all
pent
in
his
heart
:
I
was
not
worthy
*NL*
to
hear
them
uttered
.
As
I
walked
by
his
side
homeward
,
I
read
well
in
*NL*
his
iron
silence
all
he
felt
towards
me
:
the
disappointment
of
an
austere
*NL*
and
despotic
nature
,
which
has
met
resistance
where
it
expected
*NL*
submission
--
the
disapprobation
of
a
cool
,
inflexible
judgment
,
which
has
*NL*
detected
in
another
feelings
and
views
in
which
it
has
no
power
to
*NL*
sympathise
:
in
short
,
as
a
man
,
he
would
have
wished
to
coerce
me
into
*NL*
obedience
:
it
was
only
as
a
sincere
Christian
he
bore
so
patiently
with
*NL*
my
perversity
,
and
allowed
so
long
a
space
for
reflection
and
repentance
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
night
,
after
he
had
kissed
his
sisters
,
he
thought
proper
to
forget
*NL*
even
to
shake
hands
with
me
,
but
left
the
room
in
silence
.
I
--
who
,
*NL*
though
I
had
no
love
,
had
much
friendship
for
him
--
was
hurt
by
the
marked
*NL*
omission
:
so
much
hurt
that
tears
started
to
my
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
you
and
St.
John
have
been
quarrelling
,
Jane
,
''
said
Diana
,
``
during
*NL*
your
walk
on
the
moor
.
But
go
after
him
;
he
is
now
lingering
in
the
*NL*
passage
expecting
you
--
he
will
make
it
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
not
much
pride
under
such
circumstances
:
I
would
always
rather
be
*NL*
happy
than
dignified
;
and
I
ran
after
him
--
he
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
*NL*
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-night
,
St.
John
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-night
,
Jane
,
''
he
replied
calmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
shake
hands
,
''
I
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
a
cold
,
loose
touch
,
he
impressed
on
my
fingers
!
He
was
deeply
*NL*
displeased
by
what
had
occurred
that
day
;
cordiality
would
not
warm
,
nor
*NL*
tears
move
him
.
No
happy
reconciliation
was
to
be
had
with
him
--
no
*NL*
cheering
smile
or
generous
word
:
but
still
the
Christian
was
patient
and
*NL*
placid
;
and
when
I
asked
him
if
he
forgave
me
,
he
answered
that
he
was
*NL*
not
in
the
habit
of
cherishing
the
remembrance
of
vexation
;
that
he
had
*NL*
nothing
to
forgive
,
not
having
been
offended
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
with
that
answer
he
left
me
.
I
would
much
rather
he
had
knocked
me
*NL*
down
.

CHAPTER
XXXV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
leave
for
Cambridge
the
next
day
,
as
he
had
said
he
would
.
He
*NL*
deferred
his
departure
a
whole
week
,
and
during
that
time
he
made
me
feel
*NL*
what
severe
punishment
a
good
yet
stern
,
a
conscientious
yet
implacable
*NL*
man
can
inflict
on
one
who
has
offended
him
.
Without
one
overt
act
of
*NL*
hostility
,
one
upbraiding
word
,
he
contrived
to
impress
me
momently
with
*NL*
the
conviction
that
I
was
put
beyond
the
pale
of
his
favour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
that
St.
John
harboured
a
spirit
of
unchristian
vindictiveness
--
not
*NL*
that
he
would
have
injured
a
hair
of
my
head
,
if
it
had
been
fully
in
his
*NL*
power
to
do
so
.
Both
by
nature
and
principle
,
he
was
superior
to
the
*NL*
mean
gratification
of
vengeance
:
he
had
forgiven
me
for
saying
I
scorned
*NL*
him
and
his
love
,
but
he
had
not
forgotten
the
words
;
and
as
long
as
he
*NL*
and
I
lived
he
never
would
forget
them
.
I
saw
by
his
look
,
when
he
*NL*
turned
to
me
,
that
they
were
always
written
on
the
air
between
me
and
*NL*
him
;
whenever
I
spoke
,
they
sounded
in
my
voice
to
his
ear
,
and
their
*NL*
echo
toned
every
answer
he
gave
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
abstain
from
conversing
with
me
:
he
even
called
me
as
usual
*NL*
each
morning
to
join
him
at
his
desk
;
and
I
fear
the
corrupt
man
within
*NL*
him
had
a
pleasure
unimparted
to
,
and
unshared
by
,
the
pure
Christian
,
in
*NL*
evincing
with
what
skill
he
could
,
while
acting
and
speaking
apparently
*NL*
just
as
usual
,
extract
from
every
deed
and
every
phrase
the
spirit
of
*NL*
interest
and
approval
which
had
formerly
communicated
a
certain
austere
*NL*
charm
to
his
language
and
manner
.
To
me
,
he
was
in
reality
become
no
*NL*
longer
flesh
,
but
marble
;
his
eye
was
a
cold
,
bright
,
blue
gem
;
his
*NL*
tongue
a
speaking
instrument
--
nothing
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
was
torture
to
me
--
refined
,
lingering
torture
.
It
kept
up
a
*NL*
slow
fire
of
indignation
and
a
trembling
trouble
of
grief
,
which
harassed
*NL*
and
crushed
me
altogether
.
I
felt
how
--
if
I
were
his
wife
,
this
good
*NL*
man
,
pure
as
the
deep
sunless
source
,
could
soon
kill
me
,
without
drawing
*NL*
from
my
veins
a
single
drop
of
blood
,
or
receiving
on
his
own
crystal
*NL*
conscience
the
faintest
stain
of
crime
.
Especially
I
felt
this
when
I
*NL*
made
any
attempt
to
propitiate
him
.
No
ruth
met
my
ruth
.
_
He
_
*NL*
experienced
no
suffering
from
estrangement
--
no
yearning
after
*NL*
reconciliation
;
and
though
,
more
than
once
,
my
fast
falling
tears
*NL*
blistered
the
page
over
which
we
both
bent
,
they
produced
no
more
effect
*NL*
on
him
than
if
his
heart
had
been
really
a
matter
of
stone
or
metal
.
To
*NL*
his
sisters
,
meantime
,
he
was
somewhat
kinder
than
usual
:
as
if
afraid
*NL*
that
mere
coldness
would
not
sufficiently
convince
me
how
completely
I
*NL*
was
banished
and
banned
,
he
added
the
force
of
contrast
;
and
this
I
am
*NL*
sure
he
did
not
by
force
,
but
on
principle
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
night
before
he
left
home
,
happening
to
see
him
walking
in
the
garden
*NL*
about
sunset
,
and
remembering
,
as
I
looked
at
him
,
that
this
man
,
*NL*
alienated
as
he
now
was
,
had
once
saved
my
life
,
and
that
we
were
near
*NL*
relations
,
I
was
moved
to
make
a
last
attempt
to
regain
his
friendship
.
I
*NL*
went
out
and
approached
him
as
he
stood
leaning
over
the
little
gate
;
I
*NL*
spoke
to
the
point
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
St.
John
,
I
am
unhappy
because
you
are
still
angry
with
me
.
Let
us
be
*NL*
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
we
are
friends
,
''
was
the
unmoved
reply
;
while
he
still
watched
*NL*
the
rising
of
the
moon
,
which
he
had
been
contemplating
as
I
approached
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
St.
John
,
we
are
not
friends
as
we
were
.
You
know
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
we
not
?
That
is
wrong
.
For
my
part
,
I
wish
you
no
ill
and
all
*NL*
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
you
,
St.
John
;
for
I
am
sure
you
are
incapable
of
wishing
any
*NL*
one
ill
;
but
,
as
I
am
your
kinswoman
,
I
should
desire
somewhat
more
of
*NL*
affection
than
that
sort
of
general
philanthropy
you
extend
to
mere
*NL*
strangers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
''
he
said
.
``
Your
wish
is
reasonable
,
and
I
am
far
from
*NL*
regarding
you
as
a
stranger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
,
spoken
in
a
cool
,
tranquil
tone
,
was
mortifying
and
baffling
*NL*
enough
.
Had
I
attended
to
the
suggestions
of
pride
and
ire
,
I
should
*NL*
immediately
have
left
him
;
but
something
worked
within
me
more
strongly
*NL*
than
those
feelings
could
.
I
deeply
venerated
my
cousin
's
talent
and
*NL*
principle
.
His
friendship
was
of
value
to
me
:
to
lose
it
tried
me
*NL*
severely
.
I
would
not
so
soon
relinquish
the
attempt
to
reconquer
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Must
we
part
in
this
way
,
St.
John
?
And
when
you
go
to
India
,
will
you
*NL*
leave
me
so
,
without
a
kinder
word
than
you
have
yet
spoken
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
now
turned
quite
from
the
moon
and
faced
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
go
to
India
,
Jane
,
will
I
leave
you
!
What
!
do
you
not
go
to
*NL*
India
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
said
I
could
not
unless
I
married
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
will
not
marry
me
!
You
adhere
to
that
resolution
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Reader
,
do
you
know
,
as
I
do
,
what
terror
those
cold
people
can
put
into
*NL*
the
ice
of
their
questions
?
How
much
of
the
fall
of
the
avalanche
is
in
*NL*
their
anger
?
of
the
breaking
up
of
the
frozen
sea
in
their
displeasure
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
St.
John
,
I
will
not
marry
you
.
I
adhere
to
my
resolution
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
avalanche
had
shaken
and
slid
a
little
forward
,
but
it
did
not
yet
*NL*
crash
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Once
more
,
why
this
refusal
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Formerly
,
''
I
answered
,
``
because
you
did
not
love
me
;
now
,
I
reply
,
*NL*
because
you
almost
hate
me
.
If
I
were
to
marry
you
,
you
would
kill
me
.
*NL*
You
are
killing
me
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
lips
and
cheeks
turned
white
--
quite
white
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
I
should
kill
you
_
--
_
I
am
killing
you
_
?
Your
words
are
such
as
ought
*NL*
not
to
be
used
:
violent
,
unfeminine
,
and
untrue
.
They
betray
an
*NL*
unfortunate
state
of
mind
:
they
merit
severe
reproof
:
they
would
seem
*NL*
inexcusable
,
but
that
it
is
the
duty
of
man
to
forgive
his
fellow
even
*NL*
until
seventy-and-seven
times
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
finished
the
business
now
.
While
earnestly
wishing
to
erase
from
*NL*
his
mind
the
trace
of
my
former
offence
,
I
had
stamped
on
that
tenacious
*NL*
surface
another
and
far
deeper
impression
,
I
had
burnt
it
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
you
will
indeed
hate
me
,
''
I
said
.
``
It
is
useless
to
attempt
to
*NL*
conciliate
you
:
I
see
I
have
made
an
eternal
enemy
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
fresh
wrong
did
these
words
inflict
:
the
worse
,
because
they
touched
on
*NL*
the
truth
.
That
bloodless
lip
quivered
to
a
temporary
spasm
.
I
knew
the
*NL*
steely
ire
I
had
whetted
.
I
was
heart-wrung
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
utterly
misinterpret
my
words
,
''
I
said
,
at
once
seizing
his
hand
:
``
I
*NL*
have
no
intention
to
grieve
or
pain
you
--
indeed
,
I
have
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Most
bitterly
he
smiled
--
most
decidedly
he
withdrew
his
hand
from
mine
.
*NL*
``
And
now
you
recall
your
promise
,
and
will
not
go
to
India
at
all
,
I
*NL*
presume
?
''
said
he
,
after
a
considerable
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
will
,
as
your
assistant
,
''
I
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
very
long
silence
succeeded
.
What
struggle
there
was
in
him
between
*NL*
Nature
and
Grace
in
this
interval
,
I
can
not
tell
:
only
singular
gleams
*NL*
scintillated
in
his
eyes
,
and
strange
shadows
passed
over
his
face
.
He
*NL*
spoke
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
before
proved
to
you
the
absurdity
of
a
single
woman
of
your
age
*NL*
proposing
to
accompany
abroad
a
single
man
of
mine
.
I
proved
it
to
you
*NL*
in
such
terms
as
,
I
should
have
thought
,
would
have
prevented
your
ever
*NL*
again
alluding
to
the
plan
.
That
you
have
done
so
,
I
regret
--
for
your
*NL*
sake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
interrupted
him
.
Anything
like
a
tangible
reproach
gave
me
courage
at
*NL*
once
.
``
Keep
to
common
sense
,
St.
John
:
you
are
verging
on
nonsense
.
You
*NL*
pretend
to
be
shocked
by
what
I
have
said
.
You
are
not
really
shocked
:
*NL*
for
,
with
your
superior
mind
,
you
can
not
be
either
so
dull
or
so
*NL*
conceited
as
to
misunderstand
my
meaning
.
I
say
again
,
I
will
be
your
*NL*
curate
,
if
you
like
,
but
never
your
wife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
he
turned
lividly
pale
;
but
,
as
before
,
controlled
his
passion
*NL*
perfectly
.
He
answered
emphatically
but
calmly
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
female
curate
,
who
is
not
my
wife
,
would
never
suit
me
.
With
me
,
*NL*
then
,
it
seems
,
you
can
not
go
:
but
if
you
are
sincere
in
your
offer
,
I
*NL*
will
,
while
in
town
,
speak
to
a
married
missionary
,
whose
wife
needs
a
*NL*
coadjutor
.
Your
own
fortune
will
make
you
independent
of
the
Society
's
*NL*
aid
;
and
thus
you
may
still
be
spared
the
dishonour
of
breaking
your
*NL*
promise
and
deserting
the
band
you
engaged
to
join
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Now
I
never
had
,
as
the
reader
knows
,
either
given
any
formal
promise
or
*NL*
entered
into
any
engagement
;
and
this
language
was
all
much
too
hard
and
*NL*
much
too
despotic
for
the
occasion
.
I
replied
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
dishonour
,
no
breach
of
promise
,
no
desertion
in
the
case
.
I
*NL*
am
not
under
the
slightest
obligation
to
go
to
India
,
especially
with
*NL*
strangers
.
With
you
I
would
have
ventured
much
,
because
I
admire
,
*NL*
confide
in
,
and
,
as
a
sister
,
I
love
you
;
but
I
am
convinced
that
,
go
*NL*
when
and
with
whom
I
would
,
I
should
not
live
long
in
that
climate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
you
are
afraid
of
yourself
,
''
he
said
,
curling
his
lip
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
.
God
did
not
give
me
my
life
to
throw
away
;
and
to
do
as
you
wish
*NL*
me
would
,
I
begin
to
think
,
be
almost
equivalent
to
committing
suicide
.
*NL*
Moreover
,
before
I
definitively
resolve
on
quitting
England
,
I
will
know
*NL*
for
certain
whether
I
can
not
be
of
greater
use
by
remaining
in
it
than
by
*NL*
leaving
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
fruitless
to
attempt
to
explain
;
but
there
is
a
point
on
*NL*
which
I
have
long
endured
painful
doubt
,
and
I
can
go
nowhere
till
by
*NL*
some
means
that
doubt
is
removed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
where
your
heart
turns
and
to
what
it
clings
.
The
interest
you
*NL*
cherish
is
lawless
and
unconsecrated
.
Long
since
you
ought
to
have
*NL*
crushed
it
:
now
you
should
blush
to
allude
to
it
.
You
think
of
Mr.
*NL*
Rochester
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
true
.
I
confessed
it
by
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
going
to
seek
Mr.
Rochester
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
find
out
what
is
become
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
remains
for
me
,
then
,
''
he
said
,
``
to
remember
you
in
my
prayers
,
and
*NL*
to
entreat
God
for
you
,
in
all
earnestness
,
that
you
may
not
indeed
*NL*
become
a
castaway
.
I
had
thought
I
recognised
in
you
one
of
the
chosen
.
*NL*
But
God
sees
not
as
man
sees
:
_
His

will
be
done
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
opened
the
gate
,
passed
through
it
,
and
strayed
away
down
the
glen
.
He
*NL*
was
soon
out
of
sight
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
re-entering
the
parlour
,
I
found
Diana
standing
at
the
window
,
looking
*NL*
very
thoughtful
.
Diana
was
a
great
deal
taller
than
I
:
she
put
her
hand
*NL*
on
my
shoulder
,
and
,
stooping
,
examined
my
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jane
,
''
she
said
,
``
you
are
always
agitated
and
pale
now

I
am
sure
there
*NL*
is
something
the
matter

Tell
me
what
business
St.
John
and
you
have
on
*NL*
hands
.
I
have
watched
you
this
half
hour
from
the
window
;
you
must
*NL*
forgive
my
being
such
a
spy
,
but
for
a
long
time
I
have
fancied
I
hardly
*NL*
know
what

St.
John
is
a
strange
being

*NL*
*NL*
She
paused
--
I
did
not
speak
:
soon
she
resumed
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
brother
of
mine
cherishes
peculiar
views
of
some
sort
respecting
*NL*
you

I
am
sure

he
has
long
distinguished
you
by
a
notice

interest
he
*NL*
never

any

what
end

I
wish

loved
you

I
put
her
cool
hand
to
my
hot
forehead
;

No

Then

he
follow
you
so
with

get
you
so
frequently

alone
with
him

and
keep
you
so
continually
at
his
side

Mary
and
I
had
*NL*
both
concluded
he
wished
you
to
marry
him

*NL*
``
He
does

Diana
clapped
her

then
he
will
stay
in
England

*NL*
*NL*
``
Far
from
that

Diana
;
his
sole
idea
in
proposing
to
me
is
to
procure
a

fitting
fellow-labourer
in
his
Indian
toils

she
exclaimed

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
refused
to
marry
him

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
have
consequently
displeased
him

she
suggested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Deeply
:
he
will
never
forgive
me
,
I
fear

yet
I
offered

accompany
him

sister

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
frantic
folly
to
do
so

Jane

Think
of
the
task
you
*NL*
undertook
--
one
of
incessant
fatigue
,
where
fatigue
kills
even
the
strong
,
*NL*
and
you
are
weak

St.
John
--
you
know
him

would
urge
you
to
*NL*
impossibilities

with
him
there
would
be
no
permission
to
rest
during
the
*NL*
hot
hours
;
and
unfortunately
,
I
have
noticed
,
whatever
he
exacts
,
you
*NL*
force
yourself
to
perform

I
am
astonished
you
found
courage
to
refuse

his

You
do
not

him

Plain

to
be
grilled
alive
in
Calcutta

And
again
she
earnestly
conjured
me
to
*NL*
give
up
all
thoughts
of
going
out
with
her
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
indeed

I
said
;
``
for
when
just
now
I
repeated
the
offer

*NL*
serving
him
for
a
deacon

he
expressed
himself
shocked
at
my
want

*NL*
decency

He
seemed
to
think
I
had
committed
an
impropriety
in
proposing
*NL*
to
accompany
him
unmarried

as
if
I
had
not
from
the
first
hoped
to
find
*NL*
in
him
a

habitually
regarded
him
as

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
makes
you
say
he
does
not
love
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
hear
himself
on
the
subject

He
has
again
and
again
*NL*
explained
that
it
is
not
himself
,
but
his
office
he
wishes
to
mate
.
He
*NL*
has
told
me
I
am
formed

labour

not
for
love

which
is
true

no

But
,
in
my
opinion
,
if
I
am
not
formed
for
love
,
it
follows
that
*NL*
I
am
not
formed
for
marriage
.
Would
it
not
be
strange
,
Die
,
to
be
*NL*
chained
for
life
to
a
man
who
regarded
one
but
as
a
useful
tool
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Insupportable
--
unnatural
--
out
of
the
question
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then
,
''
I
continued
,
``
though
I
have
only
sisterly
affection
for
him
*NL*
now
,
yet
,
if
forced
to
be
his
wife
,
I
can
imagine
the
possibility
of
*NL*
conceiving
an
inevitable
,
strange
,
torturing
kind
of
love
for
him
,
*NL*
because
he
is
so
talented
;
and
there
is
often
a
certain
heroic
grandeur
*NL*
in
his
look
,
manner
,
and
conversation
.
In
that
case
,
my
lot
would
become
*NL*
unspeakably
wretched
.
He
would
not
want
me
to
love
him
;
and
if
I
showed
*NL*
the
feeling
,
he
would
make
me
sensible
that
it
was
a
superfluity
,
*NL*
unrequired
by
him
,
unbecoming
in
me
.
I
know
he
would
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
St.
John
is
a
good
man
,
''
said
Diana
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
a
good
and
a
great
man
;
but
he
forgets
,
pitilessly
,
the
feelings
*NL*
and
claims
of
little
people
,
in
pursuing
his
own
large
views
.
It
is
*NL*
better
,
therefore
,
for
the
insignificant
to
keep
out
of
his
way
,
lest
,
in
*NL*
his
progress
,
he
should
trample
them
down
.
Here
he
comes
!
I
will
leave
*NL*
you
,
Diana
.
''
And
I
hastened
upstairs
as
I
saw
him
entering
the
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
was
forced
to
meet
him
again
at
supper
.
During
that
meal
he
*NL*
appeared
just
as
composed
as
usual
.
I
had
thought
he
would
hardly
speak
*NL*
to
me
,
and
I
was
certain
he
had
given
up
the
pursuit
of
his
matrimonial
*NL*
scheme
:
the
sequel
showed
I
was
mistaken
on
both
points
.
He
addressed
me
*NL*
precisely
in
his
ordinary
manner
,
or
what
had
,
of
late
,
been
his
ordinary
*NL*
manner
--
one
scrupulously
polite
.
No
doubt
he
had
invoked
the
help
of
the
*NL*
Holy
Spirit
to
subdue
the
anger
I
had
roused
in
him
,
and
now
believed
he
*NL*
had
forgiven
me
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
evening
reading
before
prayers
,
he
selected
the
twenty-first
*NL*
chapter
of
Revelation
.
It
was
at
all
times
pleasant
to
listen
while
from
*NL*
his
lips
fell
the
words
of
the
Bible
:
never
did
his
fine
voice
sound
at
*NL*
once
so
sweet
and
full
--
never
did
his
manner
become
so
impressive
in
its
*NL*
noble
simplicity
,
as
when
he
delivered
the
oracles
of
God
:
and
to-night
*NL*
that
voice
took
a
more
solemn
tone
--
that
manner
a
more
thrilling
*NL*
meaning
--
as
he
sat
in
the
midst
of
his
household
circle
-LRB-
the
May
moon
*NL*
shining
in
through
the
uncurtained
window
,
and
rendering
almost
*NL*
unnecessary
the
light
of
the
candle
on
the
table
-RRB-
:
as
he
sat
there
,
*NL*
bending
over
the
great
old
Bible
,
and
described
from
its
page
the
vision
*NL*
of
the
new
heaven
and
the
new
earth
--
told
how
God
would
come
to
dwell
*NL*
with
men
,
how
He
would
wipe
away
all
tears
from
their
eyes
,
and
promised
*NL*
that
there
should
be
no
more
death
,
neither
sorrow
nor
crying
,
nor
any
*NL*
more
pain
,
because
the
former
things
were
passed
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
succeeding
words
thrilled
me
strangely
as
he
spoke
them
:
especially
*NL*
as
I
felt
,
by
the
slight
,
indescribable
alteration
in
sound
,
that
in
*NL*
uttering
them
,
his
eye
had
turned
on
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
that
overcometh
shall
inherit
all
things
;
and
I
will
be
his
God
,
and
*NL*
he
shall
be
my
son
.
But
,
''
was
slowly
,
distinctly
read
,
``
the
fearful
,
the
*NL*
unbelieving
,
&
c.
,
shall
have
their
part
in
the
lake
which
burneth
with
*NL*
fire
and
brimstone
,
which
is
the
second
death
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henceforward
,
I
knew
what
fate
St.
John
feared
for
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
calm
,
subdued
triumph
,
blent
with
a
longing
earnestness
,
marked
his
*NL*
enunciation
of
the
last
glorious
verses
of
that
chapter
.
The
reader
*NL*
believed
his
name
was
already
written
in
the
Lamb
's
book
of
life
,
and
he
*NL*
yearned
after
the
hour
which
should
admit
him
to
the
city
to
which
the
*NL*
kings
of
the
earth
bring
their
glory
and
honour
;
which
has
no
need
of
sun
*NL*
or
moon
to
shine
in
it
,
because
the
glory
of
God
lightens
it
,
and
the
*NL*
Lamb
is
the
light
thereof
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
prayer
following
the
chapter
,
all
his
energy
gathered
--
all
his
*NL*
stern
zeal
woke
:
he
was
in
deep
earnest
,
wrestling
with
God
,
and
resolved
*NL*
on
a
conquest
.
He
supplicated
strength
for
the
weak-hearted
;
guidance
*NL*
for
wanderers
from
the
fold
:
a
return
,
even
at
the
eleventh
hour
,
for
*NL*
those
whom
the
temptations
of
the
world
and
the
flesh
were
luring
from
*NL*
the
narrow
path
.
He
asked
,
he
urged
,
he
claimed
the
boon
of
a
brand
*NL*
snatched
from
the
burning
.
Earnestness
is
ever
deeply
solemn
:
first
,
as
*NL*
I
listened
to
that
prayer
,
I
wondered
at
his
;
then
,
when
it
continued
and
*NL*
rose
,
I
was
touched
by
it
,
and
at
last
awed
.
He
felt
the
greatness
and
*NL*
goodness
of
his
purpose
so
sincerely
:
others
who
heard
him
plead
for
it
,
*NL*
could
not
but
feel
it
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prayer
over
,
we
took
leave
of
him
:
he
was
to
go
at
a
very
early
hour
*NL*
in
the
morning
.
Diana
and
Mary
having
kissed
him
,
left
the
room
--
in
*NL*
compliance
,
I
think
,
with
a
whispered
hint
from
him
:
I
tendered
my
hand
,
*NL*
and
wished
him
a
pleasant
journey
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
Jane
.
As
I
said
,
I
shall
return
from
Cambridge
in
a
*NL*
fortnight
:
that
space
,
then
,
is
yet
left
you
for
reflection
.
If
I
*NL*
listened
to
human
pride
,
I
should
say
no
more
to
you
of
marriage
with
me
;
*NL*
but
I
listen
to
my
duty
,
and
keep
steadily
in
view
my
first
aim
--
to
do
*NL*
all
things
to
the
glory
of
God
.
My
Master
was
long-suffering
:
so
will
I
*NL*
be
.
I
can
not
give
you
up
to
perdition
as
a
vessel
of
wrath
:
*NL*
repent
--
resolve
,
while
there
is
yet
time
.
Remember
,
we
are
bid
to
work
*NL*
while
it
is
day
--
warned
that
`
the
night
cometh
when
no
man
shall
work
.
'
*NL*
Remember
the
fate
of
Dives
,
who
had
his
good
things
in
this
life
.
God
*NL*
give
you
strength
to
choose
that
better
part
which
shall
not
be
taken
*NL*
from
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
laid
his
hand
on
my
head
as
he
uttered
the
last
words
.
He
had
spoken
*NL*
earnestly
,
mildly
:
his
look
was
not
,
indeed
,
that
of
a
lover
beholding
*NL*
his
mistress
,
but
it
was
that
of
a
pastor
recalling
his
wandering
*NL*
sheep
--
or
better
,
of
a
guardian
angel
watching
the
soul
for
which
he
is
*NL*
responsible
.
All
men
of
talent
,
whether
they
be
men
of
feeling
or
not
;
*NL*
whether
they
be
zealots
,
or
aspirants
,
or
despots
--
provided
only
they
be
*NL*
sincere
--
have
their
sublime
moments
,
when
they
subdue
and
rule
.
I
felt
*NL*
veneration
for
St.
John
--
veneration
so
strong
that
its
impetus
thrust
me
*NL*
at
once
to
the
point
I
had
so
long
shunned
.
I
was
tempted
to
cease
*NL*
struggling
with
him
--
to
rush
down
the
torrent
of
his
will
into
the
gulf
*NL*
of
his
existence
,
and
there
lose
my
own
.
I
was
almost
as
hard
beset
by
*NL*
him
now
as
I
had
been
once
before
,
in
a
different
way
,
by
another
.
I
was
*NL*
a
fool
both
times
.
To
have
yielded
then
would
have
been
an
error
of
*NL*
principle
;
to
have
yielded
now
would
have
been
an
error
of
judgment
.
So
*NL*
I
think
at
this
hour
,
when
I
look
back
to
the
crisis
through
the
quiet
*NL*
medium
of
time
:
I
was
unconscious
of
folly
at
the
instant
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
stood
motionless
under
my
hierophant
's
touch
.
My
refusals
were
*NL*
forgotten
--
my
fears
overcome
--
my
wrestlings
paralysed
.
The
*NL*
Impossible
--
_
i.e.
_
,
my
marriage
with
St.
John
--
was
fast
becoming
the
*NL*
Possible
.
All
was
changing
utterly
with
a
sudden
sweep
.
Religion
*NL*
called
--
Angels
beckoned
--
God
commanded
--
life
rolled
together
like
a
*NL*
scroll
--
death
's
gates
opening
,
showed
eternity
beyond
:
it
seemed
,
that
*NL*
for
safety
and
bliss
there
,
all
here
might
be
sacrificed
in
a
second
.
The
*NL*
dim
room
was
full
of
visions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Could
you
decide
now
?
''
asked
the
missionary
.
The
inquiry
was
put
in
*NL*
gentle
tones
:
he
drew
me
to
him
as
gently
.
Oh
,
that
gentleness
!
how
far
*NL*
more
potent
is
it
than
force
!
I
could
resist
St.
John
's
wrath
:
I
grew
*NL*
pliant
as
a
reed
under
his
kindness
.
Yet
I
knew
all
the
time
,
if
I
*NL*
yielded
now
,
I
should
not
the
less
be
made
to
repent
,
some
day
,
of
my
*NL*
former
rebellion
.
His
nature
was
not
changed
by
one
hour
of
solemn
*NL*
prayer
:
it
was
only
elevated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
decide
if
I
were
but
certain
,
''
I
answered
:
``
were
I
but
convinced
*NL*
that
it
is
God
's
will
I
should
marry
you
,
I
could
vow
to
marry
you
here
*NL*
and
now
--
come
afterwards
what
would
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
prayers
are
heard
!
''
ejaculated
St.
John
.
He
pressed
his
hand
firmer
*NL*
on
my
head
,
as
if
he
claimed
me
:
he
surrounded
me
with
his
arm
,
_
almost
_
*NL*
as
if
he
loved
me
-LRB-
I
say
_
almost
_
--
I
knew
the
difference
--
for
I
had
felt
*NL*
what
it
was
to
be
loved
;
but
,
like
him
,
I
had
now
put
love
out
of
the
*NL*
question
,
and
thought
only
of
duty
-RRB-
.
I
contended
with
my
inward
dimness
*NL*
of
vision
,
before
which
clouds
yet
rolled
.
I
sincerely
,
deeply
,
*NL*
fervently
longed
to
do
what
was
right
;
and
only
that
.
``
Show
me
,
show
me
*NL*
the
path
!
''
I
entreated
of
Heaven
.
I
was
excited
more
than
I
had
ever
*NL*
been
;
and
whether
what
followed
was
the
effect
of
excitement
the
reader
*NL*
shall
judge
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
house
was
still
;
for
I
believe
all
,
except
St.
John
and
myself
,
*NL*
were
now
retired
to
rest
.
The
one
candle
was
dying
out
:
the
room
was
*NL*
full
of
moonlight
.
My
heart
beat
fast
and
thick
:
I
heard
its
throb
.
*NL*
Suddenly
it
stood
still
to
an
inexpressible
feeling
that
thrilled
it
*NL*
through
,
and
passed
at
once
to
my
head
and
extremities
.
The
feeling
was
*NL*
not
like
an
electric
shock
,
but
it
was
quite
as
sharp
,
as
strange
,
as
*NL*
startling
:
it
acted
on
my
senses
as
if
their
utmost
activity
hitherto
had
*NL*
been
but
torpor
,
from
which
they
were
now
summoned
and
forced
to
wake
.
*NL*
They
rose
expectant
:
eye
and
ear
waited
while
the
flesh
quivered
on
my
*NL*
bones
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
you
heard
?
What
do
you
see
?
''
asked
St.
John
.
I
saw
nothing
,
*NL*
but
I
heard
a
voice
somewhere
cry
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jane
!
Jane
!
Jane
!
''
--
nothing
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
God
!
what
is
it
?
''
I
gasped
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
might
have
said
,
``
Where
is
it
?
''
for
it
did
not
seem
in
the
room
--
nor
in
*NL*
the
house
--
nor
in
the
garden
;
it
did
not
come
out
of
the
air
--
nor
from
*NL*
under
the
earth
--
nor
from
overhead
.
I
had
heard
it
--
where
,
or
whence
,
*NL*
for
ever
impossible
to
know
!
And
it
was
the
voice
of
a
human
being
--
a
*NL*
known
,
loved
,
well-remembered
voice
--
that
of
Edward
Fairfax
Rochester
;
*NL*
and
it
spoke
in
pain
and
woe
,
wildly
,
eerily
,
urgently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
coming
!
''
I
cried
.
``
Wait
for
me
!
Oh
,
I
will
come
!
''
I
flew
to
the
*NL*
door
and
looked
into
the
passage
:
it
was
dark
.
I
ran
out
into
the
*NL*
garden
:
it
was
void
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
you
?
''
I
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hills
beyond
Marsh
Glen
sent
the
answer
faintly
back
--
``
Where
are
*NL*
you
?
''
I
listened
.
The
wind
sighed
low
in
the
firs
:
all
was
moorland
*NL*
loneliness
and
midnight
hush
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Down
superstition
!
''
I
commented
,
as
that
spectre
rose
up
black
by
the
*NL*
black
yew
at
the
gate
.
``
This
is
not
thy
deception
,
nor
thy
witchcraft
:
*NL*
it
is
the
work
of
nature
.
She
was
roused
,
and
did
--
no
miracle
--
but
her
*NL*
best
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
broke
from
St.
John
,
who
had
followed
,
and
would
have
detained
me
.
It
*NL*
was
_
my
_
time
to
assume
ascendency
.
_
My
_
powers
were
in
play
and
in
*NL*
force
.
I
told
him
to
forbear
question
or
remark
;
I
desired
him
to
leave
*NL*
me
:
I
must
and
would
be
alone
.
He
obeyed
at
once
.
Where
there
is
energy
*NL*
to
command
well
enough
,
obedience
never
fails
.
I
mounted
to
my
chamber
;
*NL*
locked
myself
in
;
fell
on
my
knees
;
and
prayed
in
my
way
--
a
different
way
*NL*
to
St.
John
's
,
but
effective
in
its
own
fashion
.
I
seemed
to
penetrate
*NL*
very
near
a
Mighty
Spirit
;
and
my
soul
rushed
out
in
gratitude
at
His
*NL*
feet
.
I
rose
from
the
thanksgiving
--
took
a
resolve
--
and
lay
down
,
*NL*
unscared
,
enlightened
--
eager
but
for
the
daylight

CHAPTER
XXXVI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
daylight
came
.
I
rose
at
dawn
.
I
busied
myself
for
an
hour
or
two
*NL*
with
arranging
my
things
in
my
chamber
,
drawers
,
and
wardrobe
,
in
the
*NL*
order
wherein
I
should
wish
to
leave
them
during
a
brief
absence
.
*NL*
Meantime
,
I
heard
St.
John
quit
his
room
.
He
stopped
at
my
door
:
I
*NL*
feared
he
would
knock
--
no
,
but
a
slip
of
paper
was
passed
under
the
door
.
*NL*
I
took
it
up
.
It
bore
these
words
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
left
me
too
suddenly
last
night
.
Had
you
stayed
but
a
little
*NL*
longer
,
you
would
have
laid
your
hand
on
the
Christian
's
cross
and
the
*NL*
angel
's
crown
.
I
shall
expect
your
clear
decision
when
I
return
this
day
*NL*
fortnight
.
Meantime
,
watch
and
pray
that
you
enter
not
into
temptation
:
*NL*
the
spirit
,
I
trust
,
is
willing
,
but
the
flesh
,
I
see
,
is
weak
.
I
shall
*NL*
pray
for
you
hourly
.
--
Yours
,
ST.
JOHN
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
spirit
,
''
I
answered
mentally
,
``
is
willing
to
do
what
is
right
;
and
my
*NL*
flesh
,
I
hope
,
is
strong
enough
to
accomplish
the
will
of
Heaven
,
when
*NL*
once
that
will
is
distinctly
known
to
me
.
At
any
rate
,
it
shall
be
*NL*
strong
enough
to
search
--
inquire
--
to
grope
an
outlet
from
this
cloud
of
*NL*
doubt
,
and
find
the
open
day
of
certainty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
first
of
June
;
yet
the
morning
was
overcast
and
chilly
:
rain
*NL*
beat
fast
on
my
casement
.
I
heard
the
front-door
open
,
and
St.
John
pass
*NL*
out
.
Looking
through
the
window
,
I
saw
him
traverse
the
garden
.
He
took
*NL*
the
way
over
the
misty
moors
in
the
direction
of
Whitcross
--
there
he
*NL*
would
meet
the
coach
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
a
few
more
hours
I
shall
succeed
you
in
that
track
,
cousin
,
''
thought
*NL*
I
:
``
I
too
have
a
coach
to
meet
at
Whitcross
.
I
too
have
some
to
see
and
*NL*
ask
after
in
England
,
before
I
depart
for
ever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
wanted
yet
two
hours
of
breakfast-time
.
I
filled
the
interval
in
*NL*
walking
softly
about
my
room
,
and
pondering
the
visitation
which
had
*NL*
given
my
plans
their
present
bent
.
I
recalled
that
inward
sensation
I
*NL*
had
experienced
:
for
I
could
recall
it
,
with
all
its
unspeakable
*NL*
strangeness
.
I
recalled
the
voice
I
had
heard
;
again
I
questioned
whence
*NL*
it
came
,
as
vainly
as
before
:
it
seemed
in
_
me
_
--
not
in
the
external
*NL*
world
.
I
asked
was
it
a
mere
nervous
impression
--
a
delusion
?
I
could
*NL*
not
conceive
or
believe
:
it
was
more
like
an
inspiration
.
The
wondrous
*NL*
shock
of
feeling
had
come
like
the
earthquake
which
shook
the
foundations
*NL*
of
Paul
and
Silas
's
prison
;
it
had
opened
the
doors
of
the
soul
's
cell
*NL*
and
loosed
its
bands
--
it
had
wakened
it
out
of
its
sleep
,
whence
it
*NL*
sprang
trembling
,
listening
,
aghast
;
then
vibrated
thrice
a
cry
on
my
*NL*
startled
ear
,
and
in
my
quaking
heart
and
through
my
spirit
,
which
*NL*
neither
feared
nor
shook
,
but
exulted
as
if
in
joy
over
the
success
of
*NL*
one
effort
it
had
been
privileged
to
make
,
independent
of
the
cumbrous
*NL*
body
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ere
many
days
,
''
I
said
,
as
I
terminated
my
musings
,
``
I
will
know
*NL*
something
of
him
whose
voice
seemed
last
night
to
summon
me
.
Letters
*NL*
have
proved
of
no
avail
--
personal
inquiry
shall
replace
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
breakfast
I
announced
to
Diana
and
Mary
that
I
was
going
a
journey
,
*NL*
and
should
be
absent
at
least
four
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alone
,
Jane
?
''
they
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
it
was
to
see
or
hear
news
of
a
friend
about
whom
I
had
for
some
*NL*
time
been
uneasy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
might
have
said
,
as
I
have
no
doubt
they
thought
,
that
they
had
*NL*
believed
me
to
be
without
any
friends
save
them
:
for
,
indeed
,
I
had
often
*NL*
said
so
;
but
,
with
their
true
natural
delicacy
,
they
abstained
from
*NL*
comment
,
except
that
Diana
asked
me
if
I
was
sure
I
was
well
enough
to
*NL*
travel
.
I
looked
very
pale
,
she
observed
.
I
replied
,
that
nothing
ailed
*NL*
me
save
anxiety
of
mind
,
which
I
hoped
soon
to
alleviate
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
easy
to
make
my
further
arrangements
;
for
I
was
troubled
with
no
*NL*
inquiries
--
no
surmises
.
Having
once
explained
to
them
that
I
could
not
*NL*
now
be
explicit
about
my
plans
,
they
kindly
and
wisely
acquiesced
in
the
*NL*
silence
with
which
I
pursued
them
,
according
to
me
the
privilege
of
free
*NL*
action
I
should
under
similar
circumstances
have
accorded
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
left
Moor
House
at
three
o'clock
p.m.
,
and
soon
after
four
I
stood
at
*NL*
the
foot
of
the
sign-post
of
Whitcross
,
waiting
the
arrival
of
the
coach
*NL*
which
was
to
take
me
to
distant
Thornfield
.
Amidst
the
silence
of
those
*NL*
solitary
roads
and
desert
hills
,
I
heard
it
approach
from
a
great
*NL*
distance
.
It
was
the
same
vehicle
whence
,
a
year
ago
,
I
had
alighted
one
*NL*
summer
evening
on
this
very
spot
--
how
desolate
,
and
hopeless
,
and
*NL*
objectless
!
It
stopped
as
I
beckoned
.
I
entered
--
not
now
obliged
to
*NL*
part
with
my
whole
fortune
as
the
price
of
its
accommodation
.
Once
more
*NL*
on
the
road
to
Thornfield
,
I
felt
like
the
messenger-pigeon
flying
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
journey
of
six-and-thirty
hours
.
I
had
set
out
from
Whitcross
*NL*
on
a
Tuesday
afternoon
,
and
early
on
the
succeeding
Thursday
morning
the
*NL*
coach
stopped
to
water
the
horses
at
a
wayside
inn
,
situated
in
the
midst
*NL*
of
scenery
whose
green
hedges
and
large
fields
and
low
pastoral
hills
*NL*
-LRB-
how
mild
of
feature
and
verdant
of
hue
compared
with
the
stern
North
-
*NL*
Midland
moors
of
Morton
!
-RRB-
met
my
eye
like
the
lineaments
of
a
once
*NL*
familiar
face
.
Yes
,
I
knew
the
character
of
this
landscape
:
I
was
sure
*NL*
we
were
near
my
bourne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
far
is
Thornfield
Hall
from
here
?
''
I
asked
of
the
ostler
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
two
miles
,
ma'am
,
across
the
fields
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
journey
is
closed
,
''
I
thought
to
myself
.
I
got
out
of
the
coach
,
*NL*
gave
a
box
I
had
into
the
ostler
's
charge
,
to
be
kept
till
I
called
for
*NL*
it
;
paid
my
fare
;
satisfied
the
coachman
,
and
was
going
:
the
brightening
*NL*
day
gleamed
on
the
sign
of
the
inn
,
and
I
read
in
gilt
letters
,
``
The
*NL*
Rochester
Arms
.
''
My
heart
leapt
up
:
I
was
already
on
my
master
's
very
*NL*
lands
.
It
fell
again
:
the
thought
struck
it
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
master
himself
may
be
beyond
the
British
Channel
,
for
aught
you
*NL*
know
:
and
then
,
if
he
is
at
Thornfield
Hall
,
towards
which
you
hasten
,
*NL*
who
besides
him
is
there
?
His
lunatic
wife
:
and
you
have
nothing
to
do
*NL*
with
him
:
you
dare
not
speak
to
him
or
seek
his
presence
.
You
have
lost
*NL*
your
labour
--
you
had
better
go
no
farther
,
''
urged
the
monitor
.
``
Ask
*NL*
information
of
the
people
at
the
inn
;
they
can
give
you
all
you
seek
:
*NL*
they
can
solve
your
doubts
at
once
.
Go
up
to
that
man
,
and
inquire
if
*NL*
Mr.
Rochester
be
at
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
suggestion
was
sensible
,
and
yet
I
could
not
force
myself
to
act
on
*NL*
it
.
I
so
dreaded
a
reply
that
would
crush
me
with
despair
.
To
prolong
*NL*
doubt
was
to
prolong
hope
.
I
might
yet
once
more
see
the
Hall
under
the
*NL*
ray
of
her
star
.
There
was
the
stile
before
me
--
the
very
fields
through
*NL*
which
I
had
hurried
,
blind
,
deaf
,
distracted
with
a
revengeful
fury
*NL*
tracking
and
scourging
me
,
on
the
morning
I
fled
from
Thornfield
:
ere
I
*NL*
well
knew
what
course
I
had
resolved
to
take
,
I
was
in
the
midst
of
them
.
*NL*
How
fast
I
walked
!
How
I
ran
sometimes
!
How
I
looked
forward
to
catch
*NL*
the
first
view
of
the
well-known
woods
!
With
what
feelings
I
welcomed
*NL*
single
trees
I
knew
,
and
familiar
glimpses
of
meadow
and
hill
between
*NL*
them
!
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
the
woods
rose
;
the
rookery
clustered
dark
;
a
loud
cawing
broke
*NL*
the
morning
stillness
.
Strange
delight
inspired
me
:
on
I
hastened
.
*NL*
Another
field
crossed
--
a
lane
threaded
--
and
there
were
the
courtyard
*NL*
walls
--
the
back
offices
:
the
house
itself
,
the
rookery
still
hid
.
``
My
*NL*
first
view
of
it
shall
be
in
front
,
''
I
determined
,
``
where
its
bold
*NL*
battlements
will
strike
the
eye
nobly
at
once
,
and
where
I
can
single
out
*NL*
my
master
's
very
window
:
perhaps
he
will
be
standing
at
it
--
he
rises
*NL*
early
:
perhaps
he
is
now
walking
in
the
orchard
,
or
on
the
pavement
in
*NL*
front
.
Could
I
but
see
him
!
--
but
a
moment
!
Surely
,
in
that
case
,
I
*NL*
should
not
be
so
mad
as
to
run
to
him
?
I
can
not
tell
--
I
am
not
certain
.
*NL*
And
if
I
did
--
what
then
?
God
bless
him
!
What
then
?
Who
would
be
hurt
*NL*
by
my
once
more
tasting
the
life
his
glance
can
give
me
?
I
rave
:
perhaps
*NL*
at
this
moment
he
is
watching
the
sun
rise
over
the
Pyrenees
,
or
on
the
*NL*
tideless
sea
of
the
south
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
coasted
along
the
lower
wall
of
the
orchard
--
turned
its
angle
:
*NL*
there
was
a
gate
just
there
,
opening
into
the
meadow
,
between
two
stone
*NL*
pillars
crowned
by
stone
balls
.
From
behind
one
pillar
I
could
peep
*NL*
round
quietly
at
the
full
front
of
the
mansion
.
I
advanced
my
head
with
*NL*
precaution
,
desirous
to
ascertain
if
any
bedroom
window-blinds
were
yet
*NL*
drawn
up
:
battlements
,
windows
,
long
front
--
all
from
this
sheltered
*NL*
station
were
at
my
command
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
crows
sailing
overhead
perhaps
watched
me
while
I
took
this
survey
.
I
*NL*
wonder
what
they
thought
.
They
must
have
considered
I
was
very
careful
*NL*
and
timid
at
first
,
and
that
gradually
I
grew
very
bold
and
reckless
.
A
*NL*
peep
,
and
then
a
long
stare
;
and
then
a
departure
from
my
niche
and
a
*NL*
straying
out
into
the
meadow
;
and
a
sudden
stop
full
in
front
of
the
*NL*
great
mansion
,
and
a
protracted
,
hardy
gaze
towards
it
.
``
What
*NL*
affectation
of
diffidence
was
this
at
first
?
''
they
might
have
demanded
;
*NL*
``
what
stupid
regardlessness
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hear
an
illustration
,
reader
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
lover
finds
his
mistress
asleep
on
a
mossy
bank
;
he
wishes
to
catch
a
*NL*
glimpse
of
her
fair
face
without
waking
her
.
He
steals
softly
over
the
*NL*
grass
,
careful
to
make
no
sound
;
he
pauses
--
fancying
she
has
stirred
:
he
*NL*
withdraws
:
not
for
worlds
would
he
be
seen
.
All
is
still
:
he
again
*NL*
advances
:
he
bends
above
her
;
a
light
veil
rests
on
her
features
:
he
*NL*
lifts
it
,
bends
lower
;
now
his
eyes
anticipate
the
vision
of
beauty
--
warm
,
*NL*
and
blooming
,
and
lovely
,
in
rest
.
How
hurried
was
their
first
glance
!
*NL*
But
how
they
fix
!
How
he
starts
!
How
he
suddenly
and
vehemently
clasps
*NL*
in
both
arms
the
form
he
dared
not
,
a
moment
since
,
touch
with
his
*NL*
finger
!
How
he
calls
aloud
a
name
,
and
drops
his
burden
,
and
gazes
on
it
*NL*
wildly
!
He
thus
grasps
and
cries
,
and
gazes
,
because
he
no
longer
fears
*NL*
to
waken
by
any
sound
he
can
utter
--
by
any
movement
he
can
make
.
He
*NL*
thought
his
love
slept
sweetly
:
he
finds
she
is
stone
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
looked
with
timorous
joy
towards
a
stately
house
:
I
saw
a
blackened
*NL*
ruin
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
need
to
cower
behind
a
gate-post
,
indeed
!
--
to
peep
up
at
chamber
*NL*
lattices
,
fearing
life
was
astir
behind
them
!
No
need
to
listen
for
*NL*
doors
opening
--
to
fancy
steps
on
the
pavement
or
the
gravel-walk
!
The
*NL*
lawn
,
the
grounds
were
trodden
and
waste
:
the
portal
yawned
void
.
The
*NL*
front
was
,
as
I
had
once
seen
it
in
a
dream
,
but
a
well-like
wall
,
very
*NL*
high
and
very
fragile-looking
,
perforated
with
paneless
windows
:
no
roof
,
*NL*
no
battlements
,
no
chimneys
--
all
had
crashed
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
there
was
the
silence
of
death
about
it
:
the
solitude
of
a
lonesome
*NL*
wild
.
No
wonder
that
letters
addressed
to
people
here
had
never
received
*NL*
an
answer
:
as
well
despatch
epistles
to
a
vault
in
a
church
aisle
.
The
*NL*
grim
blackness
of
the
stones
told
by
what
fate
the
Hall
had
fallen
--
by
*NL*
conflagration
:
but
how
kindled
?
What
story
belonged
to
this
disaster
?
*NL*
What
loss
,
besides
mortar
and
marble
and
wood-work
had
followed
upon
it
?
*NL*
Had
life
been
wrecked
as
well
as
property
?
If
so
,
whose
?
Dreadful
*NL*
question
:
there
was
no
one
here
to
answer
it
--
not
even
dumb
sign
,
mute
*NL*
token
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
wandering
round
the
shattered
walls
and
through
the
devastated
*NL*
interior
,
I
gathered
evidence
that
the
calamity
was
not
of
late
*NL*
occurrence
.
Winter
snows
,
I
thought
,
had
drifted
through
that
void
arch
,
*NL*
winter
rains
beaten
in
at
those
hollow
casements
;
for
,
amidst
the
*NL*
drenched
piles
of
rubbish
,
spring
had
cherished
vegetation
:
grass
and
*NL*
weed
grew
here
and
there
between
the
stones
and
fallen
rafters
.
And
oh
!
*NL*
where
meantime
was
the
hapless
owner
of
this
wreck
?
In
what
land
?
Under
*NL*
what
auspices
?
My
eye
involuntarily
wandered
to
the
grey
church
tower
*NL*
near
the
gates
,
and
I
asked
,
``
Is
he
with
Damer
de
Rochester
,
sharing
the
*NL*
shelter
of
his
narrow
marble
house
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Some
answer
must
be
had
to
these
questions
.
I
could
find
it
nowhere
but
*NL*
at
the
inn
,
and
thither
,
ere
long
,
I
returned
.
The
host
himself
brought
*NL*
my
breakfast
into
the
parlour
.
I
requested
him
to
shut
the
door
and
sit
*NL*
down
:
I
had
some
questions
to
ask
him
.
But
when
he
complied
,
I
scarcely
*NL*
knew
how
to
begin
;
such
horror
had
I
of
the
possible
answers
.
And
yet
*NL*
the
spectacle
of
desolation
I
had
just
left
prepared
me
in
a
measure
for
*NL*
a
tale
of
misery
.
The
host
was
a
respectable-looking
,
middle-aged
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
Thornfield
Hall
,
of
course
?
''
I
managed
to
say
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
ma'am
;
I
lived
there
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
?
''
Not
in
my
time
,
I
thought
:
you
are
a
stranger
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
the
late
Mr.
Rochester
's
butler
,
''
he
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
late
!
I
seem
to
have
received
,
with
full
force
,
the
blow
I
had
been
*NL*
trying
to
evade
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
late
!
''
I
gasped
.
``
Is
he
dead
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
the
present
gentleman
,
Mr.
Edward
's
father
,
''
he
explained
.
I
*NL*
breathed
again
:
my
blood
resumed
its
flow
.
Fully
assured
by
these
words
*NL*
that
Mr.
Edward
--
_
my
_
Mr.
Rochester
-LRB-
God
bless
him
,
wherever
he
was
!
-RRB-
--
was
*NL*
at
least
alive
:
was
,
in
short
,
``
the
present
gentleman
.
''
Gladdening
*NL*
words
!
It
seemed
I
could
hear
all
that
was
to
come
--
whatever
the
*NL*
disclosures
might
be
--
with
comparative
tranquillity
.
Since
he
was
not
in
*NL*
the
grave
,
I
could
bear
,
I
thought
,
to
learn
that
he
was
at
the
*NL*
Antipodes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Mr.
Rochester
living
at
Thornfield
Hall
now
?
''
I
asked
,
knowing
,
of
*NL*
course
,
what
the
answer
would
be
,
but
yet
desirous
of
deferring
the
*NL*
direct
question
as
to
where
he
really
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
ma'am
--
oh
,
no
!
No
one
is
living
there
.
I
suppose
you
are
a
*NL*
stranger
in
these
parts
,
or
you
would
have
heard
what
happened
last
*NL*
autumn
,
--
Thornfield
Hall
is
quite
a
ruin
:
it
was
burnt
down
just
about
*NL*
harvest-time
.
A
dreadful
calamity
!
such
an
immense
quantity
of
valuable
*NL*
property
destroyed
:
hardly
any
of
the
furniture
could
be
saved
.
The
fire
*NL*
broke
out
at
dead
of
night
,
and
before
the
engines
arrived
from
Millcote
,
*NL*
the
building
was
one
mass
of
flame
.
It
was
a
terrible
spectacle
:
I
*NL*
witnessed
it
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
dead
of
night
!
''
I
muttered
.
Yes
,
that
was
ever
the
hour
of
fatality
*NL*
at
Thornfield
.
``
Was
it
known
how
it
originated
?
''
I
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
guessed
,
ma'am
:
they
guessed
.
Indeed
,
I
should
say
it
was
*NL*
ascertained
beyond
a
doubt
.
You
are
not
perhaps
aware
,
''
he
continued
,
*NL*
edging
his
chair
a
little
nearer
the
table
,
and
speaking
low
,
``
that
there
*NL*
was
a
lady
--
a
--
a
lunatic
,
kept
in
the
house
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
heard
something
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
was
kept
in
very
close
confinement
,
ma'am
:
people
even
for
some
*NL*
years
was
not
absolutely
certain
of
her
existence
.
No
one
saw
her
:
they
*NL*
only
knew
by
rumour
that
such
a
person
was
at
the
Hall
;
and
who
or
what
*NL*
she
was
it
was
difficult
to
conjecture
.
They
said
Mr.
Edward
had
brought
*NL*
her
from
abroad
,
and
some
believed
she
had
been
his
mistress
.
But
a
*NL*
queer
thing
happened
a
year
since
--
a
very
queer
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
feared
now
to
hear
my
own
story
.
I
endeavoured
to
recall
him
to
the
*NL*
main
fact
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
this
lady
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
lady
,
ma'am
,
''
he
answered
,
``
turned
out
to
be
Mr.
Rochester
's
wife
!
*NL*
The
discovery
was
brought
about
in
the
strangest
way
.
There
was
a
young
*NL*
lady
,
a
governess
at
the
Hall
,
that
Mr.
Rochester
fell
in
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
fire
,
''
I
suggested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
coming
to
that
,
ma'am
--
that
Mr.
Edward
fell
in
love
with
.
The
*NL*
servants
say
they
never
saw
anybody
so
much
in
love
as
he
was
:
he
was
*NL*
after
her
continually
.
They
used
to
watch
him
--
servants
will
,
you
know
,
*NL*
ma'am
--
and
he
set
store
on
her
past
everything
:
for
all
,
nobody
but
him
*NL*
thought
her
so
very
handsome
.
She
was
a
little
small
thing
,
they
say
,
*NL*
almost
like
a
child
.
I
never
saw
her
myself
;
but
I
've
heard
Leah
,
the
*NL*
house-maid
,
tell
of
her
.
Leah
liked
her
well
enough
.
Mr.
Rochester
was
*NL*
about
forty
,
and
this
governess
not
twenty
;
and
you
see
,
when
gentlemen
*NL*
of
his
age
fall
in
love
with
girls
,
they
are
often
like
as
if
they
were
*NL*
bewitched
.
Well
,
he
would
marry
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
shall
tell
me
this
part
of
the
story
another
time
,
''
I
said
;
``
but
now
*NL*
I
have
a
particular
reason
for
wishing
to
hear
all
about
the
fire
.
Was
*NL*
it
suspected
that
this
lunatic
,
Mrs.
Rochester
,
had
any
hand
in
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
hit
it
,
ma'am
:
it
's
quite
certain
that
it
was
her
,
and
nobody
but
*NL*
her
,
that
set
it
going
.
She
had
a
woman
to
take
care
of
her
called
Mrs.
*NL*
Poole
--
an
able
woman
in
her
line
,
and
very
trustworthy
,
but
for
one
*NL*
fault
--
a
fault
common
to
a
deal
of
them
nurses
and
matrons
--
she
_
kept
a
*NL*
private
bottle
of
gin
by
her
_
,
and
now
and
then
took
a
drop
over-much
.
It
*NL*
is
excusable
,
for
she
had
a
hard
life
of
it
:
but
still
it
was
dangerous
;
*NL*
for
when
Mrs.
Poole
was
fast
asleep
after
the
gin
and
water
,
the
mad
*NL*
lady
,
who
was
as
cunning
as
a
witch
,
would
take
the
keys
out
of
her
*NL*
pocket
,
let
herself
out
of
her
chamber
,
and
go
roaming
about
the
house
,
*NL*
doing
any
wild
mischief
that
came
into
her
head
.
They
say
she
had
nearly
*NL*
burnt
her
husband
in
his
bed
once
:
but
I
do
n't
know
about
that
.
However
,
*NL*
on
this
night
,
she
set
fire
first
to
the
hangings
of
the
room
next
her
*NL*
own
,
and
then
she
got
down
to
a
lower
storey
,
and
made
her
way
to
the
*NL*
chamber
that
had
been
the
governess
's
--
-LRB-
she
was
like
as
if
she
knew
*NL*
somehow
how
matters
had
gone
on
,
and
had
a
spite
at
her
-RRB-
--
and
she
kindled
*NL*
the
bed
there
;
but
there
was
nobody
sleeping
in
it
,
fortunately
.
The
*NL*
governess
had
run
away
two
months
before
;
and
for
all
Mr.
Rochester
*NL*
sought
her
as
if
she
had
been
the
most
precious
thing
he
had
in
the
*NL*
world
,
he
never
could
hear
a
word
of
her
;
and
he
grew
savage
--
quite
*NL*
savage
on
his
disappointment
:
he
never
was
a
wild
man
,
but
he
got
*NL*
dangerous
after
he
lost
her
.
He
would
be
alone
,
too
.
He
sent
Mrs.
*NL*
Fairfax
,
the
housekeeper
,
away
to
her
friends
at
a
distance
;
but
he
did
*NL*
it
handsomely
,
for
he
settled
an
annuity
on
her
for
life
:
and
she
*NL*
deserved
it
--
she
was
a
very
good
woman
.
Miss
Adele
,
a
ward
he
had
,
was
*NL*
put
to
school
.
He
broke
off
acquaintance
with
all
the
gentry
,
and
shut
*NL*
himself
up
like
a
hermit
at
the
Hall
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
did
he
not
leave
England
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
England

Bless
you

no

He
would
not
cross
the
door-stones
of
*NL*
the
house
,
except
at
night
,
when
he
walked
just
like
a
ghost
about
the
*NL*
grounds
and
in
the
orchard
as
if
he
had
lost
his
senses
--
which
it
is
my
*NL*
opinion
he
had
;
for
a
more
spirited
,
bolder

keener
gentleman
than
he
was
*NL*
before
that
midge
of
a
governess
crossed
him
,
you
never
saw

He
*NL*
was
not
a
man
given
to
wine
,
or
cards
,
or
racing
,
as
some
are
,
and
he
was
*NL*
not
so
very
handsome
;
but
he
had
a
courage
and
a
will
of
his
own
,
if
ever
*NL*
man
had
.
I
knew
him
from
a
boy
,
you
see
:
and
for
my
part
,
I
have
often
*NL*
wished
that
Miss
Eyre
had
been
sunk
in
the
sea
before
she
came
to
*NL*
Thornfield
Hall
.

``
Then
Mr.

at

fire
broke
out

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

indeed
was
he

he
went
up
to
the
attics
when
all
was
burning

above

below
,
and
got
the
servants
out
of
their

and
helped
them
*NL*
down
himself

went
back
to
get
his
mad

then
they
called
out

standing

waving
her

above

off

I
witnessed

ascend

she

out
from
under
the
ruins
,
alive
,
but
sadly
hurt
:
a
*NL*
beam
had
fallen
in
such
a
way
as
to
protect
him
partly
;
but
one
eye
was
*NL*
knocked
out
,
and
one
hand
so
crushed
that
Mr.
Carter
,
the
surgeon
,
had
to
*NL*
amputate
it
directly
.
The
other
eye
inflamed
:
he
lost
the
sight
of
that
*NL*
also
.
He
is
now
helpless
,
indeed
--
blind
and
a
cripple
.

Where

he

live

CHAPTER
XXXVII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
manor-house
of
Ferndean
was
a
building
of
considerable
antiquity
,
*NL*
moderate
size
,
and
no
architectural
pretensions
,
deep
buried
in
a
wood
.
I
*NL*
had
heard
of
it
before
.
Mr.
Rochester
often
spoke
of
it
,
and
sometimes
*NL*
went
there
.
His
father
had
purchased
the
estate
for
the
sake
of
the
game
*NL*
covers
.
He
would
have
let
the
house
,
but
could
find
no
tenant
,
in
*NL*
consequence
of
its
ineligible
and
insalubrious
site
.
Ferndean
then
*NL*
remained
uninhabited
and
unfurnished
,
with
the
exception
of
some
two
or
*NL*
three
rooms
fitted
up
for
the
accommodation
of
the
squire
when
he
went
*NL*
there
in
the
season
to
shoot
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
house
I
came
just
ere
dark
on
an
evening
marked
by
the
*NL*
characteristics
of
sad
sky
,
cold
gale
,
and
continued
small
penetrating
*NL*
rain
.
The
last
mile
I
performed
on
foot
,
having
dismissed
the
chaise
and
*NL*
driver
with
the
double
remuneration
I
had
promised
.
Even
when
within
a
*NL*
very
short
distance
of
the
manor-house
,
you
could
see
nothing
of
it
,
so
*NL*
thick
and
dark
grew
the
timber
of
the
gloomy
wood
about
it
.
Iron
gates
*NL*
between
granite
pillars
showed
me
where
to
enter
,
and
passing
through
*NL*
them
,
I
found
myself
at
once
in
the
twilight
of
close-ranked
trees
.
There
*NL*
was
a
grass-grown
track
descending
the
forest
aisle
between
hoar
and
*NL*
knotty
shafts
and
under
branched
arches
.
I
followed
it
,
expecting
soon
*NL*
to
reach
the
dwelling
;
but
it
stretched
on
and
on
,
it
wound
far
and
*NL*
farther
:
no
sign
of
habitation
or
grounds
was
visible
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
I
had
taken
a
wrong
direction
and
lost
my
way
.
The
darkness
of
*NL*
natural
as
well
as
of
sylvan
dusk
gathered
over
me
.
I
looked
round
in
*NL*
search
of
another
road
.
There
was
none
:
all
was
interwoven
stem
,
*NL*
columnar
trunk
,
dense
summer
foliage
--
no
opening
anywhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
proceeded
:
at
last
my
way
opened
,
the
trees
thinned
a
little
;
presently
*NL*
I
beheld
a
railing
,
then
the
house
--
scarce
,
by
this
dim
light
,
*NL*
distinguishable
from
the
trees
;
so
dank
and
green
were
its
decaying
*NL*
walls
.
Entering
a
portal
,
fastened
only
by
a
latch
,
I
stood
amidst
a
*NL*
space
of
enclosed
ground
,
from
which
the
wood
swept
away
in
a
semicircle
.
*NL*
There
were
no
flowers
,
no
garden-beds
;
only
a
broad
gravel-walk
girdling
*NL*
a
grass-plat
,
and
this
set
in
the
heavy
frame
of
the
forest
.
The
house
*NL*
presented
two
pointed
gables
in
its
front
;
the
windows
were
latticed
and
*NL*
narrow
:
the
front
door
was
narrow
too
,
one
step
led
up
to
it
.
The
whole
*NL*
looked
,
as
the
host
of
the
Rochester
Arms
had
said
,
``
quite
a
desolate
*NL*
spot
.
''
It
was
as
still
as
a
church
on
a
week-day
:
the
pattering
rain
on
*NL*
the
forest
leaves
was
the
only
sound
audible
in
its
vicinage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
there
be
life
here
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
life
of
some
kind
there
was
;
for
I
heard
a
movement
--
that
narrow
*NL*
front-door
was
unclosing
,
and
some
shape
was
about
to
issue
from
the
*NL*
grange
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
opened
slowly
:
a
figure
came
out
into
the
twilight
and
stood
on
the
*NL*
step
;
a
man
without
a
hat
:
he
stretched
forth
his
hand
as
if
to
feel
*NL*
whether
it
rained
.
Dusk
as
it
was
,
I
had
recognised
him
--
it
was
my
*NL*
master
,
Edward
Fairfax
Rochester
,
and
no
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
stayed
my
step
,
almost
my
breath
,
and
stood
to
watch
him
--
to
examine
*NL*
him
,
myself
unseen
,
and
alas
!
to
him
invisible
.
It
was
a
sudden
meeting
,
*NL*
and
one
in
which
rapture
was
kept
well
in
check
by
pain
.
I
had
no
*NL*
difficulty
in
restraining
my
voice
from
exclamation
,
my
step
from
hasty
*NL*
advance
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
form
was
of
the
same
strong
and
stalwart
contour
as
ever
:
his
port
*NL*
was
still
erect
,
his
hair
was
still
raven
black
;
nor
were
his
features
*NL*
altered
or
sunk
:
not
in
one
year
's
space
,
by
any
sorrow
,
could
his
*NL*
athletic
strength
be
quelled
or
his
vigorous
prime
blighted
.
But
in
his
*NL*
countenance
I
saw
a
change
:
that
looked
desperate
and
brooding
--
that
*NL*
reminded
me
of
some
wronged
and
fettered
wild
beast
or
bird
,
dangerous
to
*NL*
approach
in
his
sullen
woe
.
The
caged
eagle
,
whose
gold-ringed
eyes
*NL*
cruelty
has
extinguished
,
might
look
as
looked
that
sightless
Samson
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
reader
,
do
you
think
I
feared
him
in
his
blind
ferocity
?
--
if
you
do
,
*NL*
you
little
know
me
.
A
soft
hope
blest
with
my
sorrow
that
soon
I
should
*NL*
dare
to
drop
a
kiss
on
that
brow
of
rock
,
and
on
those
lips
so
sternly
*NL*
sealed
beneath
it
:
but
not
yet
.
I
would
not
accost
him
yet
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
descended
the
one
step
,
and
advanced
slowly
and
gropingly
towards
the
*NL*
grass-plat
.
Where
was
his
daring
stride
now
?
Then
he
paused
,
as
if
he
*NL*
knew
not
which
way
to
turn
.
He
lifted
his
hand
and
opened
his
eyelids
;
*NL*
gazed
blank
,
and
with
a
straining
effort
,
on
the
sky
,
and
toward
the
*NL*
amphitheatre
of
trees
:
one
saw
that
all
to
him
was
void
darkness
.
He
*NL*
stretched
his
right
hand
-LRB-
the
left
arm
,
the
mutilated
one
,
he
kept
hidden
*NL*
in
his
bosom
-RRB-
;
he
seemed
to
wish
by
touch
to
gain
an
idea
of
what
lay
*NL*
around
him
:
he
met
but
vacancy
still
;
for
the
trees
were
some
yards
off
*NL*
where
he
stood
.
He
relinquished
the
endeavour
,
folded
his
arms
,
and
*NL*
stood
quiet
and
mute
in
the
rain
,
now
falling
fast
on
his
uncovered
head
.
*NL*
At
this
moment
John
approached
him
from
some
quarter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
take
my
arm
,
sir
?
''
he
said
;
``
there
is
a
heavy
shower
coming
on
:
*NL*
had
you
not
better
go
in
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
alone
,
''
was
the
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
John
withdrew
without
having
observed
me
.
Mr.
Rochester
now
tried
to
*NL*
walk
about
:
vainly
,
--
all
was
too
uncertain
.
He
groped
his
way
back
to
*NL*
the
house
,
and
,
re-entering
it
,
closed
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
now
drew
near
and
knocked
:
John
's
wife
opened
for
me
.
``
Mary
,
''
I
said
,
*NL*
``
how
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
started
as
if
she
had
seen
a
ghost
:
I
calmed
her
.
To
her
hurried
``
Is
*NL*
it
really
you
,
miss
,
come
at
this
late
hour
to
this
lonely
place
?
''
I
*NL*
answered
by
taking
her
hand
;
and
then
I
followed
her
into
the
kitchen
,
*NL*
where
John
now
sat
by
a
good
fire
.
I
explained
to
them
,
in
few
words
,
*NL*
that
I
had
heard
all
which
had
happened
since
I
left
Thornfield
,
and
that
*NL*
I
was
come
to
see
Mr.
Rochester
.
I
asked
John
to
go
down
to
the
turn
-
*NL*
pike-house
,
where
I
had
dismissed
the
chaise
,
and
bring
my
trunk
,
which
I
*NL*
had
left
there
:
and
then
,
while
I
removed
my
bonnet
and
shawl
,
I
*NL*
questioned
Mary
as
to
whether
I
could
be
accommodated
at
the
Manor
House
*NL*
for
the
night
;
and
finding
that
arrangements
to
that
effect
,
though
*NL*
difficult
,
would
not
be
impossible
,
I
informed
her
I
should
stay
.
Just
*NL*
at
this
moment
the
parlour-bell
rang
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
you
go
in
,
''
said
I
,
``
tell
your
master
that
a
person
wishes
to
speak
*NL*
to
him
,
but
do
not
give
my
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
he
will
see
you
,
''
she
answered
;
``
he
refuses
everybody
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
returned
,
I
inquired
what
he
had
said
.
``
You
are
to
send
in
your
*NL*
name
and
your
business
,
''
she
replied
.
She
then
proceeded
to
fill
a
glass
*NL*
with
water
,
and
place
it
on
a
tray
,
together
with
candles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
what
he
rang
for
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
:
he
always
has
candles
brought
in
at
dark
,
though
he
is
blind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
the
tray
to
me
;
I
will
carry
it
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
it
from
her
hand
:
she
pointed
me
out
the
parlour
door
.
The
tray
*NL*
shook
as
I
held
it
;
the
water
spilt
from
the
glass
;
my
heart
struck
my
*NL*
ribs
loud
and
fast
.
Mary
opened
the
door
for
me
,
and
shut
it
behind
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
parlour
looked
gloomy
:
a
neglected
handful
of
fire
burnt
low
in
the
*NL*
grate
;
and
,
leaning
over
it
,
with
his
head
supported
against
the
high
,
*NL*
old-fashioned
mantelpiece
,
appeared
the
blind
tenant
of
the
room
.
His
*NL*
old
dog
,
Pilot
,
lay
on
one
side
,
removed
out
of
the
way
,
and
coiled
up
as
*NL*
if
afraid
of
being
inadvertently
trodden
upon
.
Pilot
pricked
up
his
ears
*NL*
when
I
came
in
:
then
he
jumped
up
with
a
yelp
and
a
whine
,
and
bounded
*NL*
towards
me
:
he
almost
knocked
the
tray
from
my
hands
.
I
set
it
on
the
*NL*
table
;
then
patted
him
,
and
said
softly
,
``
Lie
down
!
''
Mr.
Rochester
*NL*
turned
mechanically
to
_
see
_
what
the
commotion
was
:
but
as
he
_
saw
_
*NL*
nothing
,
he
returned
and
sighed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
me
the
water
,
Mary
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
approached
him
with
the
now
only
half-filled
glass
;
Pilot
followed
me
,
*NL*
still
excited
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
?
''
he
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Down
,
Pilot
!
''
I
again
said
.
He
checked
the
water
on
its
way
to
his
*NL*
lips
,
and
seemed
to
listen
:
he
drank
,
and
put
the
glass
down
.
``
This
is
*NL*
you
,
Mary
,
is
it
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mary
is
in
the
kitchen
,
''
I
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
put
out
his
hand
with
a
quick
gesture
,
but
not
seeing
where
I
stood
,
*NL*
he
did
not
touch
me
.
``
Who
is
this
?
Who
is
this
?
''
he
demanded
,
trying
,
*NL*
as
it
seemed
,
to
_
see
_
with
those
sightless
eyes
--
unavailing
and
*NL*
distressing
attempt
!
``
Answer
me
--
speak
again
!
''
he
ordered
,
imperiously
*NL*
and
aloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
have
a
little
more
water
,
sir
?
I
spilt
half
of
what
was
in
the
*NL*
glass
,
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Who
_
is
it
?
_
What
_
is
it
?
Who
speaks
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pilot
knows
me
,
and
John
and
Mary
know
I
am
here
.
I
came
only
this
*NL*
evening
,
''
I
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Great
God
!
--
what
delusion
has
come
over
me
?
What
sweet
madness
has
*NL*
seized
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
delusion
--
no
madness
:
your
mind
,
sir
,
is
too
strong
for
delusion
,
*NL*
your
health
too
sound
for
frenzy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
where
is
the
speaker
?
Is
it
only
a
voice
?
Oh
!
I
_
can
not
_
see
,
but
*NL*
I
must
feel
,
or
my
heart
will
stop
and
my
brain
burst
.
Whatever
--
whoever
*NL*
you
are
--
be
perceptible
to
the
touch
or
I
can
not
live
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
groped
;
I
arrested
his
wandering
hand
,
and
prisoned
it
in
both
mine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
very
fingers
!
''
he
cried
;
``
her
small
,
slight
fingers
!
If
so
there
*NL*
must
be
more
of
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
muscular
hand
broke
from
my
custody
;
my
arm
was
seized
,
my
*NL*
shoulder
--
neck
--
waist
--
I
was
entwined
and
gathered
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
Jane
?
_
What
_
is
it
?
This
is
her
shape
--
this
is
her
size
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
this
her
voice
,
''
I
added
.
``
She
is
all
here
:
her
heart
,
too
.
God
*NL*
bless
you
,
sir
!
I
am
glad
to
be
so
near
you
again

her

I

so
blest

after

my
misery

It

a

I
have
had
at
night

I
have
clasped
her
once
more
to

my

I
do
now

kissed
her

Never

the

But
I
always
woke

found
it
an
empty

I
was
desolate
and
abandoned

my
life
dark

lonely

*NL*
hopeless
--
my
soul
athirst
and
forbidden
to

my

famished

never

Gentle

soft

nestling
in

you
will
*NL*
fly

too

I
pressed
my

his

brilliant
and
now
rayless
eyes

I
swept
his
*NL*
hair
from
his
brow
,
and
kissed
that
too
.
He
suddenly
seemed
to
arouse
*NL*
himself
:
the
conviction
of
the
reality
of
all
this
seized
him
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
He
replied
not
:
he
seemed
serious
--
abstracted
;
he
sighed
;
he
half-opened
*NL*
his
lips
as
if
to
speak
:
he
closed
them
again
.
I
felt
a
little
*NL*
embarrassed
.
Perhaps
I
had
too
rashly
over-leaped
conventionalities
;
and
*NL*
he
,
like
St.
John
,
saw
impropriety
in
my
inconsiderateness
.
I
had
indeed
*NL*
made
my
proposal
from
the
idea
that
he
wished
and
would
ask
me
to
be
his
*NL*
wife
:
an
expectation
,
not
the
less
certain
because
unexpressed
,
had
*NL*
buoyed
me
up
,
that
he
would
claim
me
at
once
as
his
own
.
But
no
hint
to
*NL*
that
effect
escaping
him
and
his
countenance
becoming
more
overcast
,
I
*NL*
suddenly
remembered
that
I
might
have
been
all
wrong
,
and
was
perhaps
*NL*
playing
the
fool
unwittingly
;
and
I
began
gently
to
withdraw
myself
from
*NL*
his
arms
--
but
he
eagerly
snatched
me
closer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
no

Jane
;
you

not

No

I
have
touched
you

heard

felt
*NL*
the
comfort
of
your
presence

the
sweetness
of
your
consolation

I
can
not
*NL*
give
up
these
joys

I
have
little
left
in
myself

I
must
have
you

The
*NL*
world
may
laugh
--
may
call
me
absurd
,
selfish
--
but
it
does
not
signify
.
My
*NL*
very
soul
demands
you
:
it
will
be
satisfied
,
or
it
will
take
deadly
*NL*
vengeance
on
its
frame
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

I
will
stay
with

said
so

*NL*
*NL*

Yes

but
you
understand
one
thing
by
staying

I

*NL*
another

You

perhaps
,
could
make
up
your

be
about

*NL*
chair

to
wait
on
me

a
kind
little

prompt
you
to
make
sacrifices

you

that
ought
to
suffice
for
me
no

suppose
I

should
now
entertain
none

fatherly
feelings

do
you
think
so

*NL*
*NL*

it
better

day

*NL*
He
relapsed
again
into
gloom
.
I
,
on
the
contrary
,
became
more
cheerful
,
*NL*
and
took
fresh
courage
:
these
last
words
gave
me
an
insight
as
to
where
*NL*
the
difficulty
lay
;
and
as
it
was
no
difficulty
with
me
,
I
felt
quite
*NL*
relieved
from
my
previous
embarrassment
.
I
resumed
a
livelier
vein
of
*NL*
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
time
some
one
undertook
to
rehumanise
you
,
''
said
I
,
parting
his
*NL*
thick
and
long
uncut
locks
;
``
for
I
see
you
are
being
metamorphosed
into
a
*NL*
lion
,
or
something
of
that
sort
.
You
have
a
`
faux
air
'
of
Nebuchadnezzar
*NL*
in
the
fields
about
you
,
that
is
certain
:
your
hair
reminds
me
of
eagles
'
*NL*
feathers
;
whether
your
nails
are
grown
like
birds
'
claws
or
not
,
I
have
*NL*
not
yet
noticed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
this
arm
,
I
have
neither
hand
nor
nails

''
he
said
,
drawing
the
*NL*
mutilated
limb
from
his
breast
,
and
showing
it
to
me
.
``
It
is
a
mere
*NL*
stump
--
a
ghastly
sight
!
Do
n't
you
think
so
,
Jane

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
pity
to
see
it

a
pity
to
see
your
eyes

and
the
scar
of

fire
on
your
forehead
:
and
the
worst
of
it
is
,
one
is
in
danger
of
loving
*NL*
you
too
well
for
all
this
;
and
making
too
much
of
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
would
be
revolted

``
Did
you

your

Now
,
let
me
leave
you
an
instant
,
to
make
a
better
fire
,
*NL*
and
have
the
hearth
swept
up

Can
you
tell
when
there
is
a
good
fire

*NL*
``
Yes

right

haze

*NL*
Summoning
Mary
,
I
soon
had
the
room
in
more
cheerful
order
:
I
prepared
*NL*
him
,
likewise
,
a
comfortable
repast
.
My
spirits
were
excited
,
and
with
*NL*
pleasure
and
ease
I
talked
to
him
during
supper
,
and
for
a
long
time
*NL*
after
.
There
was
no
harassing
restraint
,
no
repressing
of
glee
and
*NL*
vivacity
with
him
;
for
with
him
I
was
at
perfect
ease
,
because
I
knew
I
*NL*
suited
him
;
all
I
said
or
did
seemed
either
to
console
or
revive
him
.
*NL*
Delightful
consciousness
!
It
brought
to
life
and
light
my
whole
nature
:
*NL*
in
his
presence
I
thoroughly
lived
;
and
he
lived
in
mine
.
Blind
as
he
*NL*
was
,
smiles
played
over
his
face
,
joy
dawned
on
his
forehead
:
his
*NL*
lineaments
softened
and
warmed
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
supper
,
he
began
to
ask
me
many
questions
,
of
where
I
had
been
,
*NL*
what
I
had
been
doing
,
how
I
had
found
him
out
;
but
I
gave
him
only
very
*NL*
partial
replies
:
it
was
too
late
to
enter
into
particulars
that
night
.
*NL*
Besides
,
I
wished
to
touch
no
deep-thrilling
chord
--
to
open
no
fresh
well
*NL*
of
emotion
in
his
heart
:
my
sole
present
aim
was
to
cheer
him
.
Cheered
,
*NL*
as
I
have
said
,
he
was
:
and
yet
but
by
fits
.
If
a
moment
's
silence
broke
*NL*
the
conversation
,
he
would
turn
restless
,
touch
me
,
then
say
,
``
Jane
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
altogether
a
human
being

You

Yet
how

on

doleful
evening

could
you
so
suddenly
rise

my

?
I
stretched
my
hand
to
take
a
glass
of
water
from
a
*NL*
hireling
,
and
it
was
given
me
by
you

I
asked
a
question

expecting

answer

voice

a
dark

dreary

hopeless
life
I
have
dragged
on
for
*NL*
months
past

Doing
nothing

expecting
nothing

merging
night
in
day

*NL*
feeling
but
the
sensation
of
cold
when
I
let
the
fire
go
out

of
hunger
*NL*
when
I
forgot
to
eat
:
and
then
a
ceaseless
sorrow
,
and
,
at
times
,
a
very
*NL*
delirium
of
desire
to
behold
my
Jane
again
.
Yes

for
her
restoration
I
*NL*
longed

far
more
than
for
that
of
my
lost
sight

How
can
it
be
that

is
with
me

and
says
she
loves
me
?
Will
she
not
depart
as
suddenly

she
came

To-morrow

I
fear

shall
find
her
no

A
commonplace

practical
reply

out
of
the
train
of
his

disturbed

ideas

was
,
I
was
sure
,
the
best
and
most
reassuring
for
him
in
this

I
passed
my
finger
over
his

remarked
that

they
were
scorched

that

apply
something

I
laughed
and
made
my
escape
,
still
laughing
as
I
ran
upstairs
.
``
A
good
*NL*
idea
!
''
I
thought
with
glee

``
I
see
I
have
the
means

fretting
him
out

of
his
melancholy
for
some
time

come

*NL*
*NL*
Very
early
the
next
morning
I
heard
him
up
and
astir
,
wandering
from
one
*NL*
room
to
another
.
As
soon
as
Mary
came
down
I
heard
the
question
:
``
Is
*NL*
Miss
Eyre
here
?
''
Then
:
``
Which
room
did
you
put
her
into
?
Was
it
dry
?
Is
*NL*
she
up
?
Go
and
ask
if
she
wants
anything
;
and
when
she
will
come
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
came
down
as
soon
as
I
thought
there
was
a
prospect
of
breakfast
.
*NL*
Entering
the
room
very
softly
,
I
had
a
view
of
him
before
he
discovered
*NL*
my
presence
.
It
was
mournful
,
indeed
,
to
witness
the
subjugation
of
that
*NL*
vigorous
spirit
to
a
corporeal
infirmity
.
He
sat
in
his
chair
--
still
,
*NL*
but
not
at
rest
:
expectant
evidently
;
the
lines
of
now
habitual
sadness
*NL*
marking
his
strong
features
.
His
countenance
reminded
one
of
a
lamp
*NL*
quenched
,
waiting
to
be
re-lit
--
and
alas
!
it
was
not
himself
that
could
*NL*
now
kindle
the
lustre
of
animated
expression
:
he
was
dependent
on
another
*NL*
for
that
office
!
I
had
meant
to
be
gay
and
careless
,
but
the
*NL*
powerlessness
of
the
strong
man
touched
my
heart
to
the
quick
:
still
I
*NL*
accosted
him
with
what
vivacity
I
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
bright
,
sunny
morning
,
sir
,
''
I
said
.
``
The
rain
is
over
and
*NL*
gone
,
and
there
is
a
tender
shining
after
it
:
you
shall
have
a
walk
*NL*
soon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
wakened
the
glow
:
his
features
beamed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
are
indeed
there
,
my
skylark
!
Come
to
me
.
You
are
not
gone
:
*NL*
not
vanished
?
I
heard
one
of
your
kind
an
hour
ago
,
singing
high
over
*NL*
the
wood
:
but
its
song
had
no
music
for
me
,
any
more
than
the
rising
sun
*NL*
had
rays
.
All
the
melody
on
earth
is
concentrated
in
my
Jane
's
tongue
to
*NL*
my
ear
-LRB-
I
am
glad
it
is
not
naturally
a
silent
one
-RRB-
:
all
the
sunshine
I
*NL*
can
feel
is
in
her
presence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
water
stood
in
my
eyes
to
hear
this
avowal
of
his
dependence
;
just
as
*NL*
if
a
royal
eagle
,
chained
to
a
perch
,
should
be
forced
to
entreat
a
*NL*
sparrow
to
become
its
purveyor
.
But
I
would
not
be
lachrymose
:
I
dashed
*NL*
off
the
salt
drops
,
and
busied
myself
with
preparing
breakfast
.
*NL*
*NL*
Most
of
the
morning
was
spent
in
the
open
air
.
I
led
him
out
of
the
wet
*NL*
and
wild
wood
into
some
cheerful
fields
:
I
described
to
him
how
*NL*
brilliantly
green
they
were
;
how
the
flowers
and
hedges
looked
refreshed
;
*NL*
how
sparklingly
blue
was
the
sky
.
I
sought
a
seat
for
him
in
a
hidden
*NL*
and
lovely
spot
,
a
dry
stump
of
a
tree
;
nor
did
I
refuse
to
let
him
,
when
*NL*
seated
,
place
me
on
his
knee
.
Why
should
I
,
when
both
he
and
I
were
*NL*
happier
near
than
apart
?
Pilot
lay
beside
us
:
all
was
quiet
.
He
broke
*NL*
out
suddenly
while
clasping
me
in
his
arms
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cruel
,
cruel
deserter
!
Oh
,
Jane
,
what
did
I
feel
when
I
discovered
you
*NL*
had
fled
from
Thornfield
,
and
when
I
could
nowhere
find
you
;
and
,
after
*NL*
examining
your
apartment
,
ascertained
that
you
had
taken
no
money
,
nor
*NL*
anything
which
could
serve
as
an
equivalent
!
A
pearl
necklace
I
had
*NL*
given
you
lay
untouched
in
its
little
casket
;
your
trunks
were
left
*NL*
corded
and
locked
as
they
had
been
prepared
for
the
bridal
tour
.
What
*NL*
could
my
darling
do
,
I
asked
,
left
destitute
and
penniless
?
And
what
did
*NL*
she
do
?
Let
me
hear
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
urged
,
I
began
the
narrative
of
my
experience
for
the
last
year
.
I
*NL*
softened
considerably
what
related
to
the
three
days
of
wandering
and
*NL*
starvation
,
because
to
have
told
him
all
would
have
been
to
inflict
*NL*
unnecessary
pain
:
the
little
I
did
say
lacerated
his
faithful
heart
*NL*
deeper
than
I
wished
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
should
not
have
left
him
thus
,
he
said
,
without
any
means
of
making
my
*NL*
way
:
I
should
have
told
him
my
intention
.
I
should
have
confided
in
him
:
*NL*
he
would
never
have
forced
me
to
be
his
mistress
.
Violent
as
he
had
*NL*
seemed
in
his
despair
,
he
,
in
truth
,
loved
me
far
too
well
and
too
*NL*
tenderly
to
constitute
himself
my
tyrant
:
he
would
have
given
me
half
his
*NL*
fortune
,
without
demanding
so
much
as
a
kiss
in
return
,
rather
than
I
*NL*
should
have
flung
myself
friendless
on
the
wide
world
.
I
had
endured
,
he
*NL*
was
certain
,
more
than
I
had
confessed
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
whatever
my
sufferings
had
been
,
they
were
very
short
,
''
I
*NL*
answered
:
and
then
I
proceeded
to
tell
him
how
I
had
been
received
at
*NL*
Moor
House
;
how
I
had
obtained
the
office
of
schoolmistress
,
&
c
.
The
*NL*
accession
of
fortune
,
the
discovery
of
my
relations
,
followed
in
due
*NL*
order
.
Of
course
,
St.
John
Rivers
'
name
came
in
frequently
in
the
*NL*
progress
of
my
tale
.
When
I
had
done
,
that
name
was
immediately
taken
*NL*
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
St.
John
,
then
,
is
your
cousin
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
spoken
of
him
often

*NL*
*NL*

good
man

not

low

phlegmatic

plain

goodness

*NL*
*NL*
I
perceived
,
of
course

the
drift

my
interlocutor

Jealousy
had
got
*NL*
hold
of
him
:
she
stung
him
;

the
sting
was
salutary

it
gave
him
*NL*
respite

the
gnawing
fang
of
melancholy

``

*NL*

Again

as

painful

darkened
his

*NL*
*NL*
``
My

he

regretfully

*NL*
*NL*
I
caressed

in
order
to
soothe
him

I
knew
of
what
he
was
thinking
,
and
*NL*
wanted
to
speak
for
him
,
but
dared
not
.
As
he
turned
aside
his
face
a
*NL*
minute
,
I
saw
a
tear
slide
from
under
the
sealed
eyelid
,
and
trickle
down
*NL*
the
manly
cheek
.
My
heart
swelled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
no
better
than
the
old
lightning-struck
chestnut-tree
in
Thornfield
*NL*
orchard

he
remarked
ere
long
.
``
And
what
right
would
that
ruin
have
to

bid
a

woodbine
cover
its
decay
with
freshness

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

grow

''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
he
smiled
:
I
gave
him
comfort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You

he
asked

*NL*
*NL*
``

I
answered
rather

I

more

could
not
tell

my

swells
*NL*
with
gratitude
to
the
beneficent
God

now

He
sees
not

as
man
sees
,

far
clearer
:
judges
not
as
man
judges

far
more
*NL*
wisely

I
did
wrong

I
would
have
sullied
my
innocent
flower

breathed
*NL*
guilt
on
its
purity
:
the
Omnipotent
snatched
it
from
me

I
,
in
my
stiff
-
*NL*
necked
rebellion
,
almost
cursed
the
dispensation
:
instead
of
bending
to
*NL*
the
decree
,
I
defied
it

Divine
justice
pursued
its
course
;
disasters
*NL*
came
thick
on
me

I
was
forced
to
pass
through
the
valley

the
shadow

of
death

_
His

chastisements
are
mighty

one
smote
me

has

humbled
me

proud

my
strength

what
is
it
*NL*
now

when
I
must
give
it
over
to
foreign
guidance

as
a
child
does
its
*NL*
weakness
?
Of
late
,
Jane
--
only
--
only
of
late
--
I
began
to
see
and
*NL*
acknowledge
the
hand
of
God
in
my
doom

I
began
to
experience
remorse
,
*NL*
repentance
;
the
wish
for
reconcilement
to
my
Maker
.
I
began
sometimes
to
*NL*
pray

very
brief
prayers
they
were
,
but
very
sincere
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
days
since
:
nay
,
I
can
number
them

four
;
it
was
last
Monday
night

*NL*
a
singular
mood
came
over
me
:
one
in
which
grief
replaced
frenzy
--
sorrow
,
*NL*
sullenness
.
I
had
long
had
the
impression
that
since
I
could
nowhere
*NL*
find
you
,
you
must
be
dead

Late
that
night
--
perhaps
it
might
be
between
*NL*
eleven
and
twelve
o'clock
--
ere
I
retired
to
my
dreary
rest
,
I
supplicated
*NL*
God
,
that
,
if
it
seemed
good
to
Him
,
I
might
soon
be
taken
from
this
*NL*
life
,
and
admitted
to
that
world
to
come
,
where
there
was
still
hope
of
*NL*
rejoining
Jane

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
in
my
own
room

and
sitting
by
the
window
,
which
was
open

it
*NL*
soothed
me
to
feel
the
balmy
night-air
;
though
I
could
see
no
stars
and
*NL*
only
by
a
vague
,
luminous
haze
,
knew
the
presence
of
a
moon

I
longed
*NL*
for
thee
,
Janet

Oh
,
I
longed
for
thee
both
with
soul

flesh

I
*NL*
asked
of
God
,
at
once
in
anguish
and
humility
,
if
I
had
not
been
long
*NL*
enough
desolate
,
afflicted
,
tormented
;
and
might
not
soon
taste
bliss
and
*NL*
peace
once
more

That
I
merited
all
I
endured
,
I
acknowledged

that
I
*NL*
could
scarcely
endure
more
,
I
pleaded
;
and
the
alpha
and
omega
of
my
*NL*
heart
's
wishes
broke
involuntarily
from
my
lips
in
the
words
--

frantic

Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
As
I
exclaimed
`
Jane
!
Jane
!
Jane
!
'
a
voice
--
I
can
not
tell
whence
the
*NL*
voice
came
,
but
I
know
whose
voice
it
was
--
replied
,
'
I
am
coming
:
wait
*NL*
for
me
;
'
and
a
moment
after
,
went
whispering
on
the
wind
the
words
--
`
Where
*NL*
are
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
,
if
I
can
,
the
idea
,
the
picture
these
words
opened
to
my
*NL*
mind
:
yet
it
is
difficult
to
express
what
I
want
to
express
.
Ferndean
is
*NL*
buried
,
as
you
see
,
in
a
heavy
wood
,
where
sound
falls
dull
,
and
dies
*NL*
unreverberating
.
`
Where
are
you
?
'
seemed
spoken
amongst
mountains
;
for
I
*NL*
heard
a
hill-sent
echo
repeat
the
words
.
Cooler
and
fresher
at
the
*NL*
moment
the
gale
seemed
to
visit
my
brow
:
I
could
have
deemed
that
in
some
*NL*
wild
,
lone
scene
,
I
and
Jane
were
meeting
.
In
spirit
,
I
believe
we
must
*NL*
have
met
.
You
no
doubt
were
,
at
that
hour
,
in
unconscious
sleep
,
Jane
:
*NL*
perhaps
your
soul
wandered
from
its
cell
to
comfort
mine
;
for
those
were
*NL*
your
accents
--
as
certain
as
I
live
--
they
were
yours
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Reader
,
it
was
on
Monday
night
--
near
midnight
--
that
I
too
had
received
*NL*
the
mysterious
summons
:
those
were
the
very
words
by
which
I
replied
to
*NL*
it
.
I
listened
to
Mr.
Rochester
's
narrative
,
but
made
no
disclosure
in
*NL*
return
.
The
coincidence
struck
me
as
too
awful
and
inexplicable
to
be
*NL*
communicated
or
discussed
.
If
I
told
anything
,
my
tale
would
be
such
as
*NL*
must
necessarily
make
a
profound
impression
on
the
mind
of
my
hearer
:
and
*NL*
that
mind
,
yet
from
its
sufferings
too
prone
to
gloom
,
needed
not
the
*NL*
deeper
shade
of
the
supernatural
.
I
kept
these
things
then
,
and
pondered
*NL*
them
in
my
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
not
now
wonder
,
''
continued
my
master
,
``
that
when
you
rose
upon
me
*NL*
so
unexpectedly
last
night
,
I
had
difficulty
in
believing
you
any
other
*NL*
than
a
mere
voice
and
vision
,
something
that
would
melt
to
silence
and
*NL*
annihilation
,
as
the
midnight
whisper
and
mountain
echo
had
melted
*NL*
before
.
Now
,
I
thank
God
!
I
know
it
to
be
otherwise
.
Yes
,
I
thank
*NL*
God
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
put
me
off
his
knee
,
rose
,
and
reverently
lifting
his
hat
from
his
*NL*
brow
,
and
bending
his
sightless
eyes
to
the
earth
,
he
stood
in
mute
*NL*
devotion
.
Only
the
last
words
of
the
worship
were
audible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thank
my
Maker
,
that
,
in
the
midst
of
judgment
,
he
has
remembered
*NL*
mercy
.
I
humbly
entreat
my
Redeemer
to
give
me
strength
to
lead
*NL*
henceforth
a
purer
life
than
I
have
done
hitherto
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
stretched
his
hand
out
to
be
led
.
I
took
that
dear
hand
,
held
it
*NL*
a
moment
to
my
lips
,
then
let
it
pass
round
my
shoulder
:
being
so
much
*NL*
lower
of
stature
than
he
,
I
served
both
for
his
prop
and
guide
.
We
*NL*
entered
the
wood
,
and
wended
homeward
.

CHAPTER
XXXVIII
--
CONCLUSION
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Reader
,
I
married
him
.
A
quiet
wedding
we
had
:
he
and
I
,
the
parson
and
*NL*
clerk
,
were
alone
present
.
When
we
got
back
from
church
,
I
went
into
the
*NL*
kitchen
of
the
manor-house
,
where
Mary
was
cooking
the
dinner
and
John
*NL*
cleaning
the
knives
,
and
I
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mary
,
I
have
been
married
to
Mr.
Rochester
this
morning
.
''
The
*NL*
housekeeper
and
her
husband
were
both
of
that
decent
phlegmatic
order
of
*NL*
people
,
to
whom
one
may
at
any
time
safely
communicate
a
remarkable
piece
*NL*
of
news
without
incurring
the
danger
of
having
one
's
ears
pierced
by
some
*NL*
shrill
ejaculation
,
and
subsequently
stunned
by
a
torrent
of
wordy
*NL*
wonderment
.
Mary
did
look
up
,
and
she
did
stare
at
me
:
the
ladle
with
*NL*
which
she
was
basting
a
pair
of
chickens
roasting
at
the
fire
,
did
for
*NL*
some
three
minutes
hang
suspended
in
air
;
and
for
the
same
space
of
time
*NL*
John
's
knives
also
had
rest
from
the
polishing
process
:
but
Mary
,
bending
*NL*
again
over
the
roast
,
said
only
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
,
Miss
?
Well
,
for
sure
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
short
time
after
she
pursued
--
``
I
seed
you
go
out
with
the
master
,
but
I
*NL*
did
n't
know
you
were
gone
to
church
to
be
wed
;
''
and
she
basted
away
.
*NL*
John
,
when
I
turned
to
him
,
was
grinning
from
ear
to
ear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
telled
Mary
how
it
would
be
,
''
he
said
:
``
I
knew
what
Mr.
Edward
''
-LRB-
John
*NL*
was
an
old
servant
,
and
had
known
his
master
when
he
was
the
cadet
of
the
*NL*
house
,
therefore
,
he
often
gave
him
his
Christian
name
-RRB-
--
``
I
knew
what
Mr.
*NL*
Edward
would
do
;
and
I
was
certain
he
would
not
wait
long
neither
:
and
*NL*
he
's
done
right
,
for
aught
I
know
.
I
wish
you
joy
,
Miss
!
''
and
he
*NL*
politely
pulled
his
forelock
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
John
.
Mr.
Rochester
told
me
to
give
you
and
Mary
this
.
''
I
*NL*
put
into
his
hand
a
five-pound
note
.
Without
waiting
to
hear
more
,
I
*NL*
left
the
kitchen
.
In
passing
the
door
of
that
sanctum
some
time
after
,
I
*NL*
caught
the
words
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
'll
happen
do
better
for
him
nor
ony
o
`
t
'
grand
ladies
.
''
And
again
,
*NL*
``
If
she
be
n't
one
o
'
th
'
handsomest
,
she
's
noan
faal
and
varry
*NL*
good-natured
;
and
i
'
his
een
she
's
fair
beautiful
,
onybody
may
see
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
wrote
to
Moor
House
and
to
Cambridge
immediately
,
to
say
what
I
had
*NL*
done
:
fully
explaining
also
why
I
had
thus
acted
.
Diana
and
Mary
*NL*
approved
the
step
unreservedly
.
Diana
announced
that
she
would
just
give
*NL*
me
time
to
get
over
the
honeymoon
,
and
then
she
would
come
and
see
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
had
better
not
wait
till
then
,
Jane
,
''
said
Mr.
Rochester
,
when
I
*NL*
read
her
letter
to
him
;
``
if
she
does
,
she
will
be
too
late
,
for
our
*NL*
honeymoon
will
shine
our
life
long
:
its
beams
will
only
fade
over
your
*NL*
grave
or
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
How
St.
John
received
the
news
,
I
do
n't
know
:
he
never
answered
the
*NL*
letter
in
which
I
communicated
it
:
yet
six
months
after
he
wrote
to
me
,
*NL*
without
,
however
,
mentioning
Mr.
Rochester
's
name
or
alluding
to
my
*NL*
marriage
.
His
letter
was
then
calm
,
and
,
though
very
serious
,
kind
.
He
*NL*
has
maintained
a
regular
,
though
not
frequent
,
correspondence
ever
since
:
*NL*
he
hopes
I
am
happy
,
and
trusts
I
am
not
of
those
who
live
without
God
in
*NL*
the
world
,
and
only
mind
earthly
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
have
not
quite
forgotten
little
Adele
,
have
you
,
reader
?
I
had
not
;
*NL*
I
soon
asked
and
obtained
leave
of
Mr.
Rochester
,
to
go
and
see
her
at
*NL*
the
school
where
he
had
placed
her
.
Her
frantic
joy
at
beholding
me
*NL*
again
moved
me
much
.
She
looked
pale
and
thin
:
she
said
she
was
not
*NL*
happy
.
I
found
the
rules
of
the
establishment
were
too
strict
,
its
*NL*
course
of
study
too
severe
for
a
child
of
her
age
:
I
took
her
home
with
*NL*
me
.
I
meant
to
become
her
governess
once
more
,
but
I
soon
found
this
*NL*
impracticable
;
my
time
and
cares
were
now
required
by
another
--
my
husband
*NL*
needed
them
all
.
So
I
sought
out
a
school
conducted
on
a
more
indulgent
*NL*
system
,
and
near
enough
to
permit
of
my
visiting
her
often
,
and
bringing
*NL*
her
home
sometimes
.
I
took
care
she
should
never
want
for
anything
that
*NL*
could
contribute
to
her
comfort
:
she
soon
settled
in
her
new
abode
,
*NL*
became
very
happy
there
,
and
made
fair
progress
in
her
studies
.
As
she
*NL*
grew
up
,
a
sound
English
education
corrected
in
a
great
measure
her
*NL*
French
defects
;
and
when
she
left
school
,
I
found
in
her
a
pleasing
and
*NL*
obliging
companion
:
docile
,
good-tempered
,
and
well-principled
.
By
her
*NL*
grateful
attention
to
me
and
mine
,
she
has
long
since
well
repaid
any
*NL*
little
kindness
I
ever
had
it
in
my
power
to
offer
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
tale
draws
to
its
close
:
one
word
respecting
my
experience
of
married
*NL*
life
,
and
one
brief
glance
at
the
fortunes
of
those
whose
names
have
most
*NL*
frequently
recurred
in
this
narrative
,
and
I
have
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
now
been
married
ten
years
.
I
know
what
it
is
to
live
entirely
*NL*
for
and
with
what
I
love
best
on
earth
.
I
hold
myself
supremely
*NL*
blest
--
blest
beyond
what
language
can
express
;
because
I
am
my
husband
's
*NL*
life
as
fully
as
he
is
mine
.
No
woman
was
ever
nearer
to
her
mate
than
I
*NL*
am
:
ever
more
absolutely
bone
of
his
bone
and
flesh
of
his
flesh
.
I
know
*NL*
no
weariness
of
my
Edward
's
society
:
he
knows
none
of
mine
,
any
more
than
*NL*
we
each
do
of
the
pulsation
of
the
heart
that
beats
in
our
separate
*NL*
bosoms
;
consequently
,
we
are
ever
together
.
To
be
together
is
for
us
to
*NL*
be
at
once
as
free
as
in
solitude
,
as
gay
as
in
company
.
We
talk
,
I
*NL*
believe
,
all
day
long
:
to
talk
to
each
other
is
but
a
more
animated
and
*NL*
an
audible
thinking
.
All
my
confidence
is
bestowed
on
him
,
all
his
*NL*
confidence
is
devoted
to
me
;
we
are
precisely
suited
in
character
--
perfect
*NL*
concord
is
the
result
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Rochester
continued
blind
the
first
two
years
of
our
union
;
perhaps
*NL*
it
was
that
circumstance
that
drew
us
so
very
near
--
that
knit
us
so
very
*NL*
close
:
for
I
was
then
his
vision
,
as
I
am
still
his
right
hand
.
*NL*
Literally
,
I
was
-LRB-
what
he
often
called
me
-RRB-
the
apple
of
his
eye
.
He
saw
*NL*
nature
--
he
saw
books
through
me
;
and
never
did
I
weary
of
gazing
for
his
*NL*
behalf
,
and
of
putting
into
words
the
effect
of
field
,
tree
,
town
,
river
,
*NL*
cloud
,
sunbeam
--
of
the
landscape
before
us
;
of
the
weather
round
us
--
and
*NL*
impressing
by
sound
on
his
ear
what
light
could
no
longer
stamp
on
his
*NL*
eye
.
Never
did
I
weary
of
reading
to
him
;
never
did
I
weary
of
*NL*
conducting
him
where
he
wished
to
go
:
of
doing
for
him
what
he
wished
to
*NL*
be
done
.
And
there
was
a
pleasure
in
my
services
,
most
full
,
most
*NL*
exquisite
,
even
though
sad
--
because
he
claimed
these
services
without
*NL*
painful
shame
or
damping
humiliation
.
He
loved
me
so
truly
,
that
he
knew
*NL*
no
reluctance
in
profiting
by
my
attendance
:
he
felt
I
loved
him
so
*NL*
fondly
,
that
to
yield
that
attendance
was
to
indulge
my
sweetest
wishes
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
at
the
end
of
the
two
years
,
as
I
was
writing
a
letter
to
his
*NL*
dictation
,
he
came
and
bent
over
me
,
and
said
--
``
Jane
,
have
you
a
*NL*
glittering
ornament
round
your
neck
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
a
gold
watch-chain
:
I
answered
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
have
you
a
pale
blue
dress
on
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
-LCB-
And
have
you
a
pale
blue
dress
on
?
:
p435.jpg
-RCB-
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
.
He
informed
me
then
,
that
for
some
time
he
had
fancied
the
*NL*
obscurity
clouding
one
eye
was
becoming
less
dense
;
and
that
now
he
was
*NL*
sure
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
and
I
went
up
to
London
.
He
had
the
advice
of
an
eminent
oculist
;
and
*NL*
he
eventually
recovered
the
sight
of
that
one
eye
.
He
can
not
now
see
*NL*
very
distinctly
:
he
can
not
read
or
write
much
;
but
he
can
find
his
way
*NL*
without
being
led
by
the
hand
:
the
sky
is
no
longer
a
blank
to
him
--
the
*NL*
earth
no
longer
a
void
.
When
his
first-born
was
put
into
his
arms
,
he
*NL*
could
see
that
the
boy
had
inherited
his
own
eyes
,
as
they
once
*NL*
were
--
large
,
brilliant
,
and
black
.
On
that
occasion
,
he
again
,
with
a
*NL*
full
heart
,
acknowledged
that
God
had
tempered
judgment
with
mercy
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
Edward
and
I
,
then
,
are
happy
:
and
the
more
so
,
because
those
we
most
*NL*
love
are
happy
likewise
.
Diana
and
Mary
Rivers
are
both
married
:
*NL*
alternately
,
once
every
year
,
they
come
to
see
us
,
and
we
go
to
see
them
.
*NL*
Diana
's
husband
is
a
captain
in
the
navy
,
a
gallant
officer
and
a
good
*NL*
man
.
Mary
's
is
a
clergyman
,
a
college
friend
of
her
brother
's
,
and
,
from
*NL*
his
attainments
and
principles
,
worthy
of
the
connection
.
Both
Captain
*NL*
Fitzjames
and
Mr.
Wharton
love
their
wives
,
and
are
loved
by
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
St.
John
Rivers
,
he
left
England
:
he
went
to
India
.
He
entered
on
*NL*
the
path
he
had
marked
for
himself
;
he
pursues
it
still
.
A
more
*NL*
resolute
,
indefatigable
pioneer
never
wrought
amidst
rocks
and
dangers
.
*NL*
Firm
,
faithful
,
and
devoted
,
full
of
energy
,
and
zeal
,
and
truth
,
he
*NL*
labours
for
his
race
;
he
clears
their
painful
way
to
improvement
;
he
hews
*NL*
down
like
a
giant
the
prejudices
of
creed
and
caste
that
encumber
it
.
He
*NL*
may
be
stern
;
he
may
be
exacting
;
he
may
be
ambitious
yet
;
but
his
is
the
*NL*
sternness
of
the
warrior
Greatheart
,
who
guards
his
pilgrim
convoy
from
*NL*
the
onslaught
of
Apollyon
.
His
is
the
exaction
of
the
apostle
,
who
*NL*
speaks
but
for
Christ
,
when
he
says
--
``
Whosoever
will
come
after
me
,
let
*NL*
him
deny
himself
,
and
take
up
his
cross
and
follow
me
.
''
His
is
the
*NL*
ambition
of
the
high
master-spirit
,
which
aims
to
fill
a
place
in
the
*NL*
first
rank
of
those
who
are
redeemed
from
the
earth
--
who
stand
without
*NL*
fault
before
the
throne
of
God
,
who
share
the
last
mighty
victories
of
*NL*
the
Lamb
,
who
are
called
,
and
chosen
,
and
faithful
.
*NL*
*NL*
St.
John
is
unmarried
:
he
never
will
marry
now
.
Himself
has
hitherto
*NL*
sufficed
to
the
toil
,
and
the
toil
draws
near
its
close
:
his
glorious
sun
*NL*
hastens
to
its
setting
.
The
last
letter
I
received
from
him
drew
from
my
*NL*
eyes
human
tears
,
and
yet
filled
my
heart
with
divine
joy
:
he
anticipated
*NL*
his
sure
reward
,
his
incorruptible
crown
.
I
know
that
a
stranger
's
hand
*NL*
will
write
to
me
next
,
to
say
that
the
good
and
faithful
servant
has
been
*NL*
called
at
length
into
the
joy
of
his
Lord
.
And
why
weep
for
this
?
No
*NL*
fear
of
death
will
darken
St.
John
's
last
hour
:
his
mind
will
be
*NL*
unclouded
,
his
heart
will
be
undaunted
,
his
hope
will
be
sure
,
his
faith
*NL*
steadfast
.
His
own
words
are
a
pledge
of
this
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
Master
,
''
he
says
,
``
has
forewarned
me
.
Daily
He
announces
more
*NL*
distinctly
,
--
`
Surely
I
come
quickly
!
'
and
hourly
I
more
eagerly
*NL*
respond
,
--
`
Amen
;
even
so
come
,
Lord
Jesus
!
