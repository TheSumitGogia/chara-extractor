STORY
OF
THE
DOOR
*NL*
*NL*
MR.
UTTERSON
the
lawyer
was
a
man
of
a
rugged
countenance
,
that
was
*NL*
never
lighted
by
a
smile
;
cold
,
scanty
and
embarrassed
in
*NL*
discourse
;
backward
in
sentiment
;
lean
,
long
,
dusty
,
dreary
,
and
*NL*
yet
somehow
lovable
.
At
friendly
meetings
,
and
when
the
wine
was
to
*NL*
his
taste
,
something
eminently
human
beaconed
from
his
eye
;
*NL*
something
indeed
which
never
found
its
way
into
his
talk
,
but
which
*NL*
spoke
not
only
in
these
silent
symbols
of
the
after-dinner
face
,
but
*NL*
more
often
and
loudly
in
the
acts
of
his
life
.
He
was
austere
with
*NL*
himself
;
drank
gin
when
he
was
alone
,
to
mortify
a
taste
for
*NL*
vintages
;
and
though
he
enjoyed
the
theatre
,
had
not
crossed
the
*NL*
doors
of
one
for
twenty
years
.
But
he
had
an
approved
tolerance
for
*NL*
others
;
sometimes
wondering
,
almost
with
envy
,
at
the
high
pressure
*NL*
of
spirits
involved
in
their
misdeeds
;
and
in
any
extremity
inclined
*NL*
to
help
rather
than
to
reprove
.
*NL*
*NL*
2
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
incline
to
Cain
's
heresy
,
''
he
used
to
say
quaintly
:
``
I
let
my
*NL*
brother
go
to
the
devil
in
his
own
way
.
''
In
this
character
,
it
was
*NL*
frequently
his
fortune
to
be
the
last
reputable
acquaintance
and
the
*NL*
last
good
influence
in
the
lives
of
down-going
men
.
And
to
such
as
*NL*
these
,
so
long
as
they
came
about
his
chambers
,
he
never
marked
a
*NL*
shade
of
change
in
his
demeanour
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
doubt
the
feat
was
easy
to
Mr.
Utterson
;
for
he
was
*NL*
undemonstrative
at
the
best
,
and
even
his
friendship
seemed
to
be
*NL*
founded
in
a
similar
catholicity
of
good-nature
.
It
is
the
mark
of
a
*NL*
modest
man
to
accept
his
friendly
circle
ready-made
from
the
hands
*NL*
of
opportunity
;
and
that
was
the
lawyer
's
way
.
His
friends
were
*NL*
those
of
his
own
blood
or
those
whom
he
had
known
the
longest
;
his
*NL*
affections
,
like
ivy
,
were
the
growth
of
time
,
they
implied
no
*NL*
aptness
in
the
object
.
Hence
,
no
doubt
,
the
bond
that
united
him
to
*NL*
Mr.
Richard
Enfield
,
his
distant
kinsman
,
the
well-known
man
about
*NL*
town
.
It
was
a
nut
to
crack
for
many
,
what
these
two
could
see
in
*NL*
each
other
,
or
what
subject
they
could
find
in
common
.
It
was
*NL*
reported
by
those
who
encountered
them
in
their
Sunday
walks
,
that
*NL*
they
said
nothing
,
looked
singularly
dull
,
and
would
hail
with
*NL*
obvious
relief
the
appearance
of
a
friend
.
For
all
that
,
the
two
men
*NL*
put
the
greatest
store
by
these
excursions
,
counted
them
the
chief
*NL*
jewel
of
each
week
,
and
not
only
set
aside
occasions
of
pleasure
,
*NL*
but
even
resisted
the
calls
*NL*
*NL*
3
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
of
business
,
that
they
might
enjoy
them
uninterrupted
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
chanced
on
one
of
these
rambles
that
their
way
led
them
down
a
*NL*
by-street
in
a
busy
quarter
of
London
.
The
street
was
small
and
*NL*
what
is
called
quiet
,
but
it
drove
a
thriving
trade
on
the
*NL*
week-days
.
The
inhabitants
were
all
doing
well
,
it
seemed
,
and
all
*NL*
emulously
hoping
to
do
better
still
,
and
laying
out
the
surplus
of
*NL*
their
gains
in
coquetry
;
so
that
the
shop
fronts
stood
along
that
*NL*
thoroughfare
with
an
air
of
invitation
,
like
rows
of
smiling
*NL*
saleswomen
.
Even
on
Sunday
,
when
it
veiled
its
more
florid
charms
*NL*
and
lay
comparatively
empty
of
passage
,
the
street
shone
out
in
*NL*
contrast
to
its
dingy
neighbourhood
,
like
a
fire
in
a
forest
;
and
*NL*
with
its
freshly
painted
shutters
,
well-polished
brasses
,
and
*NL*
general
cleanliness
and
gaiety
of
note
,
instantly
caught
and
pleased
*NL*
the
eye
of
the
passenger
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
doors
from
one
corner
,
on
the
left
hand
going
east
,
the
line
*NL*
was
broken
by
the
entry
of
a
court
;
and
just
at
that
point
,
a
*NL*
certain
sinister
block
of
building
thrust
forward
its
gable
on
the
*NL*
street
.
It
was
two
stories
high
;
showed
no
window
,
nothing
but
a
*NL*
door
on
the
lower
story
and
a
blind
forehead
of
discoloured
wall
on
*NL*
the
upper
;
and
bore
in
every
feature
,
the
marks
of
prolonged
and
*NL*
sordid
negligence
.
The
door
,
which
was
equipped
with
neither
bell
*NL*
nor
knocker
,
was
blistered
and
distained
.
Tramps
slouched
into
the
*NL*
recess
and
struck
matches
on
*NL*
*NL*
4
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
the
panels
;
children
kept
shop
upon
the
steps
;
the
schoolboy
had
*NL*
tried
his
knife
on
the
mouldings
;
and
for
close
on
a
generation
,
no
*NL*
one
had
appeared
to
drive
away
these
random
visitors
or
to
repair
*NL*
their
ravages
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Enfield
and
the
lawyer
were
on
the
other
side
of
the
by-street
;
*NL*
but
when
they
came
abreast
of
the
entry
,
the
former
lifted
up
his
*NL*
cane
and
pointed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
ever
remark
that
door
?
''
he
asked
;
and
when
his
companion
*NL*
had
replied
in
the
affirmative
,
``
It
is
connected
in
my
mind
,
''
added
*NL*
he
,
``
with
a
very
odd
story
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
?
''
said
Mr.
Utterson
,
with
a
slight
change
of
voice
,
``
and
*NL*
what
was
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
was
this
way
,
''
returned
Mr.
Enfield
:
``
I
was
coming
home
*NL*
from
some
place
at
the
end
of
the
world
,
about
three
o'clock
of
a
*NL*
black
winter
morning
,
and
my
way
lay
through
a
part
of
town
where
*NL*
there
was
literally
nothing
to
be
seen
but
lamps
.
Street
after
*NL*
street
,
and
all
the
folks
asleep
--
street
after
street
,
all
lighted
*NL*
up
as
if
for
a
procession
and
all
as
empty
as
a
church
--
till
at
*NL*
last
I
got
into
that
state
of
mind
when
a
man
listens
and
listens
*NL*
and
begins
to
long
for
the
sight
of
a
policeman
.
All
at
once
,
I
saw
*NL*
two
figures
:
one
a
little
man
who
was
stumping
along
eastward
at
a
*NL*
good
walk
,
and
the
other
a
girl
of
maybe
eight
or
ten
who
was
*NL*
running
as
hard
as
she
was
able
down
a
cross
street
.
Well
,
sir
,
the
*NL*
two
ran
into
one
another
naturally
enough
at
the
*NL*
*NL*
5
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
corner
;
and
then
came
the
horrible
part
of
the
thing
;
for
the
man
*NL*
trampled
calmly
over
the
child
's
body
and
left
her
screaming
on
*NL*
the
ground
.
It
sounds
nothing
to
hear
,
but
it
was
hellish
to
see
.
*NL*
It
was
n't
like
a
man
;
it
was
like
some
damned
Juggernaut
.
I
gave
a
*NL*
view-halloa
,
took
to
my
heels
,
collared
my
gentleman
,
and
brought
*NL*
him
back
to
where
there
was
already
quite
a
group
about
the
*NL*
screaming
child
.
He
was
perfectly
cool
and
made
no
resistance
,
but
*NL*
gave
me
one
look
,
so
ugly
that
it
brought
out
the
sweat
on
me
like
*NL*
running
.
The
people
who
had
turned
out
were
the
girl
's
own
family
;
*NL*
and
pretty
soon
,
the
doctor
,
for
whom
she
had
been
sent
,
put
in
his
*NL*
appearance
.
Well
,
the
child
was
not
much
the
worse
,
more
frightened
,
*NL*
according
to
the
Sawbones
;
and
there
you
might
have
supposed
would
*NL*
be
an
end
to
it
.
But
there
was
one
curious
circumstance
.
I
had
taken
*NL*
a
loathing
to
my
gentleman
at
first
sight
.
So
had
the
child
's
*NL*
family
,
which
was
only
natural
.
But
the
doctor
's
case
was
what
*NL*
struck
me
.
He
was
the
usual
cut-and-dry
apothecary
,
of
no
particular
*NL*
age
and
colour
,
with
a
strong
Edinburgh
accent
,
and
about
as
*NL*
emotional
as
a
bagpipe
.
Well
,
sir
,
he
was
like
the
rest
of
us
;
every
*NL*
time
he
looked
at
my
prisoner
,
I
saw
that
Sawbones
turn
sick
and
*NL*
white
with
the
desire
to
kill
him
.
I
knew
what
was
in
his
mind
,
just
*NL*
as
he
knew
what
was
in
mine
;
and
killing
being
out
of
the
question
,
*NL*
we
did
the
next
best
.
We
told
the
man
we
could
*NL*
*NL*
6
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
and
would
make
such
a
scandal
out
of
this
,
as
should
make
his
name
*NL*
stink
from
one
end
of
London
to
the
other
.
If
he
had
any
friends
or
*NL*
any
credit
,
we
undertook
that
he
should
lose
them
.
And
all
the
time
,
*NL*
as
we
were
pitching
it
in
red
hot
,
we
were
keeping
the
women
off
him
*NL*
as
best
we
could
,
for
they
were
as
wild
as
harpies
.
I
never
saw
a
*NL*
circle
of
such
hateful
faces
;
and
there
was
the
man
in
the
middle
,
*NL*
with
a
kind
of
black
,
sneering
coolness
--
frightened
too
,
I
could
*NL*
see
that
--
but
carrying
it
off
,
sir
,
really
like
Satan
.
`
If
you
*NL*
choose
to
make
capital
out
of
this
accident
,
'
said
he
,
'
I
am
*NL*
naturally
helpless
.
No
gentleman
but
wishes
to
avoid
a
scene
,
'
says
*NL*
he
.
`
Name
your
figure
.
'
Well
,
we
screwed
him
up
to
a
hundred
pounds
*NL*
for
the
child
's
family
;
he
would
have
clearly
liked
to
stick
out
;
*NL*
but
there
was
something
about
the
lot
of
us
that
meant
mischief
,
and
*NL*
at
last
he
struck
.
The
next
thing
was
to
get
the
money
;
and
where
*NL*
do
you
think
he
carried
us
but
to
that
place
with
the
door
?
--
*NL*
whipped
out
a
key
,
went
in
,
and
presently
came
back
with
the
matter
*NL*
of
ten
pounds
in
gold
and
a
cheque
for
the
balance
on
Coutts
's
,
*NL*
drawn
payable
to
bearer
and
signed
with
a
name
that
I
ca
n't
mention
,
*NL*
though
it
's
one
of
the
points
of
my
story
,
but
it
was
a
name
at
*NL*
least
very
well
known
and
often
printed
.
The
figure
was
stiff
;
but
*NL*
the
signature
was
good
for
more
than
that
,
if
it
was
only
genuine
.
I
*NL*
took
the
liberty
of
pointing
out
to
my
gentleman
that
the
whole
*NL*
*NL*
7
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
business
looked
apocryphal
,
and
that
a
man
does
not
,
in
real
life
,
*NL*
walk
into
a
cellar
door
at
four
in
the
morning
and
come
out
of
it
*NL*
with
another
man
's
cheque
for
close
upon
a
hundred
pounds
.
But
he
*NL*
was
quite
easy
and
sneering
.
`
Set
your
mind
at
rest
,
'
says
he
,
'
I
*NL*
will
stay
with
you
till
the
banks
open
and
cash
the
cheque
myself
.
'
*NL*
So
we
all
set
off
,
the
doctor
,
and
the
child
's
father
,
and
our
*NL*
friend
and
myself
,
and
passed
the
rest
of
the
night
in
my
chambers
;
*NL*
and
next
day
,
when
we
had
breakfasted
,
went
in
a
body
to
the
bank
.
I
*NL*
gave
in
the
check
myself
,
and
said
I
had
every
reason
to
believe
it
*NL*
was
a
forgery
.
Not
a
bit
of
it
.
The
cheque
was
genuine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tut-tut
,
''
said
Mr.
Utterson
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
you
feel
as
I
do
,
''
said
Mr.
Enfield
.
``
Yes
,
it
's
a
bad
story
.
*NL*
For
my
man
was
a
fellow
that
nobody
could
have
to
do
with
,
a
really
*NL*
damnable
man
;
and
the
person
that
drew
the
cheque
is
the
very
pink
*NL*
of
the
proprieties
,
celebrated
too
,
and
-LRB-
what
makes
it
worse
-RRB-
one
of
*NL*
your
fellows
who
do
what
they
call
good
.
Black-mail
,
I
suppose
;
an
*NL*
honest
man
paying
through
the
nose
for
some
of
the
capers
of
his
*NL*
youth
.
Black-Mail
House
is
what
I
call
that
place
with
the
door
,
in
*NL*
consequence
.
Though
even
that
,
you
know
,
is
far
from
explaining
*NL*
all
,
''
he
added
,
and
with
the
words
fell
into
a
vein
of
musing
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
this
he
was
recalled
by
Mr.
Utterson
asking
rather
suddenly
:
*NL*
``
And
you
do
n't
know
if
the
drawer
of
the
cheque
lives
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
8
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
likely
place
,
is
n't
it
?
''
returned
Mr.
Enfield
.
``
But
I
happen
to
*NL*
have
noticed
his
address
;
he
lives
in
some
square
or
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
never
asked
about
the
--
place
with
the
door
?
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Utterson
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
:
I
had
a
delicacy
,
''
was
the
reply
.
``
I
feel
very
strongly
*NL*
about
putting
questions
;
it
partakes
too
much
of
the
style
of
the
*NL*
day
of
judgment
.
You
start
a
question
,
and
it
's
like
starting
a
*NL*
stone
.
You
sit
quietly
on
the
top
of
a
hill
;
and
away
the
stone
*NL*
goes
,
starting
others
;
and
presently
some
bland
old
bird
-LRB-
the
last
*NL*
you
would
have
thought
of
-RRB-
is
knocked
on
the
head

his
own
*NL*
back-garden
and
the
family
have
to
change
their
name
.
No
,
sir
,
I
*NL*
make
it
a
rule
of
mine
:
the
more
it
looks
like
Queer
Street
,
the
*NL*
less
I
ask
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
very
good
rule
,
too
,
''
said
the
lawyer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
have
studied
the
place
for
myself
,
''
continued
Mr.
Enfield
.
*NL*
``
It
seems
scarcely
a
house
.
There
is
no
other
door
,
and
nobody
goes
*NL*
in
or
out
of
that
one
but
,
once
in
a
great
while
,
the
gentleman
of
*NL*
my
adventure
.
There
are
three
windows
looking
on
the
court
on
the
*NL*
first
floor
;
none
below
;
the
windows
are
always
shut
but
they
're
*NL*
clean
.
And
then
there
is
a
chimney
which
is
generally
smoking
;
so
*NL*
somebody
must
live
there
.
And
yet
it
's
not
so
sure
;
for
the
*NL*
buildings
are
so
packed
together
about
that
court

that
it
's
hard

say
where
one
ends
and
another
begins

The
pair
walked
on
again
for
a
while
in
silence
;
and
then
,
*NL*
``
Enfield

''
said
Mr.
Utterson
,
``
that
's
a

yours

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

I
think
it
is

returned
Enfield
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
for
all
that
,
''
continued
the
lawyer
,
``
there
's
one
point
I
want
*NL*
to
ask
:
I
want
to
ask
the
name
of
that
man
who
walked
over
the
*NL*
child

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Mr.
Enfield
,
``
I
ca
n't
see
what
harm
it
would

It
*NL*
was
a

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Mr.

``
What
sort
of
a

is
he
to
see

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
not
easy
to
describe

There
is
something
wrong
with
his

appearance

something
displeasing

something
downright
detestable
.
I
*NL*
never
saw
a
man
I
so
disliked
,
and
yet
I
scarce
know
why
.
He
must
be
*NL*
deformed
somewhere
;
he
gives
a
strong
feeling
of
deformity
,
although
*NL*
I
could
n't
specify
the
point

He
's
an
extraordinary-looking

yet
I
really
can
name
nothing
out

the

No
,
sir
;
I
can
make
no

hand
of
it
;
I
ca
n't
describe
him

And
it
's
not
want
of

for
I

declare
I
can
see
him
this
moment

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Utterson
again
walked
some
way
in
silence
and
obviously
under
a
*NL*
weight
of
consideration
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
sure
he
used
a
key

he
inquired
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

began

surprised
out
of
himself
.
*NL*

-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

I
know

said
Utterson
;
``
I
know
it
must
seem
strange

The

fact
is
,
if
I
do

ask

it
is
*NL*

I

Mr.

sighed
deeply

said
never
a

the

presently
resumed

SEARCH
FOR
MR.
HYDE
*NL*
*NL*
THAT
evening
Mr.
Utterson
came
home
to
his
bachelor
house
in
sombre
*NL*
spirits
and
sat
down
to
dinner
without
relish
.
It
was
his
custom
of
*NL*
a
Sunday
,
when
this
meal
was
over
,
to
sit
close
by
the
fire
,
a
*NL*
volume
of
some
dry
divinity
on
his
reading-desk
,
until
the
clock
of
*NL*
the
neighbouring
church
rang
out
the
hour
of
twelve
,
when
he
would
*NL*
go
soberly
and
gratefully
to
bed
.
On
this
night
,
however
,
as
soon
as
*NL*
the
cloth
was
taken
away
,
he
took
up
a
candle
and
went
into
his
*NL*
business-room
.
There
he
opened
his
safe
,
took
from
the
most
private
*NL*
part
of
it
a
document
endorsed
on
the
envelope
as
Dr.
Jekyll
's
Will
,
*NL*
and
sat
down
with
a
clouded
brow
to
study
its
contents
.
The
will
was
*NL*
holograph
,
for
Mr.
Utterson
,
though
he
took
charge
of
it
now
that
it
*NL*
was
made
,
had
refused
to
lend
the
least
assistance
in
the
making
of
*NL*
it
;
it
provided
not
only
that
,
in
case
of
the
decease
of
Henry
*NL*
Jekyll
,
M.D.
,
D.C.L.
,
L.L.D.
,
F.R.S.
,
etc.
,
all
his
possessions
were
*NL*
to
pass
into
the
hands
of
his
``
friend
and
benefactor
Edward
Hyde
,
''
*NL*
but
that
in
case
of
*NL*
*NL*
12
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Jekyll
's
``
disappearance
or
unexplained
absence
for
any
period
*NL*
exceeding
three
calendar
months
,
''
the
said
Edward
Hyde
should
step
*NL*
into
the
said
Henry
Jekyll
's
shoes
without
further
delay
and
free
*NL*
from
any
burthen
or
obligation
,
beyond
the
payment
of
a
few
small
*NL*
sums
to
the
members
of
the
doctor
's
household
.
This
document
had
*NL*
long
been
the
lawyer
's
eyesore
.
It
offended
him
both
as
a
lawyer
and
*NL*
as
a
lover
of
the
sane
and
customary
sides
of
life
,
to
whom
the
*NL*
fanciful
was
the
immodest
.
And
hitherto
it
was
his
ignorance
of
Mr.
*NL*
Hyde
that
had
swelled
his
indignation
;
now
,
by
a
sudden
turn
,
it
was
*NL*
his
knowledge
.
It
was
already
bad
enough
when
the
name
was
but
a
*NL*
name
of
which
he
could
learn
no
more
.
It
was
worse
when
it
began
to
*NL*
be
clothed
upon
with
detestable
attributes
;
and
out
of
the
shifting
,
*NL*
insubstantial
mists
that
had
so
long
baffled
his
eye
,
there
leaped
*NL*
up
the
sudden
,
definite
presentment
of
a
fiend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
it
was
madness
,
''
he
said
,
as
he
replaced
the
obnoxious
*NL*
paper
in
the
safe
,
``
and
now
I
begin
to
fear
it
is
disgrace
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
that
he
blew
out
his
candle
,
put
on
a
great-coat
,
and
set
*NL*
forth
in
the
direction
of
Cavendish
Square
,
that
citadel
of
*NL*
medicine
,
where
his
friend
,
the
great
Dr.
Lanyon
,
had
his
house
and
*NL*
received
his
crowding
patients
.
``
If
any
one
knows
,
it
will
be
*NL*
Lanyon
,
''
he
had
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
solemn
butler
knew
and
welcomed
him
;
*NL*
*NL*
13
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
he
was
subjected
to
no
stage
of
delay
,
but
ushered
direct
from
the
*NL*
door
to
the
dining-room
where
Dr.
Lanyon
sat
alone
over
his
wine
.
*NL*
This
was
a
hearty
,
healthy
,
dapper
,
red-faced
gentleman
,
with
a
*NL*
shock
of
hair
prematurely
white
,
and
a
boisterous
and
decided
*NL*
manner
.
At
sight
of
Mr.
Utterson
,
he
sprang
up
from
his
chair
and
*NL*
welcomed
him
with
both
hands
.
The
geniality
,
as
was
the
way
of
the
*NL*
man
,
was
somewhat
theatrical
to
the
eye
;
but
it
reposed
on
genuine
*NL*
feeling
.
For
these
two
were
old
friends
,
old
mates
both
at
school
*NL*
and
college
,
both
thorough
respecters
of
themselves
and
of
each
*NL*
other
,
and
,
what
does
not
always
follow
,
men
who
thoroughly
enjoyed
*NL*
each
other
's
company
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
little
rambling
talk
,
the
lawyer
led
up
to
the
subject
*NL*
which
so
disagreeably
pre-occupied
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
,
Lanyon
,
''
said
he
``
you
and
I
must
be
the
two
oldest
*NL*
friends
that
Henry
Jekyll
has
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
the
friends
were
younger
,
''
chuckled
Dr.
Lanyon
.
``
But
I
*NL*
suppose
we
are
.
And
what
of
that
?
I
see
little
of
him
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
?
''
said
Utterson
.
``
I
thought
you
had
a
bond
of
common
*NL*
interest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
had
,
''
was
the
reply
.
``
But
it
is
more
than
ten
years
since
Henry
*NL*
Jekyll
became
too
fanciful
for
me
.
He
began
to
go
wrong
,
wrong
in
*NL*
mind
;
and
though
of
course
I
continue
to
take
an
interest
in
him
for
*NL*
old
sake
's
sake
,
as
they
say
,
*NL*
*NL*
14
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
I
see
and
I
have
seen
devilish
little
of
the
man
.
Such
unscientific
*NL*
balderdash
,
''
added
the
doctor
,
flushing
suddenly
purple
,
``
would
have
*NL*
estranged
Damon
and
Pythias
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
little
spirit
of
temper
was
somewhat
of
a
relief
to
Mr.
*NL*
Utterson
.
``
They
have
only
differed
on
some
point
of
science
,
''
he
*NL*
thought
;
and
being
a
man
of
no
scientific
passions
-LRB-
except
in
the
*NL*
matter
of
conveyancing
-RRB-
,
he
even
added
:
``
It
is
nothing
worse
than
*NL*
that
!
''
He
gave
his
friend
a
few
seconds
to
recover
his
composure
,
*NL*
and
then
approached
the
question
he
had
come
to
put
.
``
Did
you
ever
*NL*
come
across
a
protege
of
his
--
one
Hyde
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hyde
?
''
repeated
Lanyon
.
``
No
.
Never
heard
of
him
.
Since
my
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
the
amount
of
information
that
the
lawyer
carried
back
*NL*
with
him
to
the
great
,
dark
bed
on
which
he
tossed
to
and
fro
,
*NL*
until
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
began
to
grow
large
.
It
was
a
*NL*
night
of
little
ease
to
his
toiling
mind
,
toiling
in
mere
darkness
*NL*
and
besieged
by
questions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Six
o'clock
struck
on
the
bells
of
the
church
that
was
so
*NL*
conveniently
near
to
Mr.
Utterson
's
dwelling
,
and
still
he
was
*NL*
digging
at
the
problem
.
Hitherto
it
had
touched
him
on
the
*NL*
intellectual
side
alone
;
but
now
his
imagination
also
was
engaged
,
*NL*
or
rather
enslaved
;
and
as
he
lay
and
tossed
in
the
gross
darkness
*NL*
of
the
night
and
the
curtained
room
,
Mr.
Enfield
's
tale
went
by
*NL*
*NL*
15
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
before
his
mind
in
a
scroll
of
lighted
pictures
.
He
would
be
aware
*NL*
of
the
great
field
of
lamps
of
a
nocturnal
city
;
then
of
the
figure
*NL*
of
a
man
walking
swiftly
;
then
of
a
child
running
from
the
doctor
's
;
*NL*
and
then
these
met
,
and
that
human
Juggernaut
trod
the
child
down
*NL*
and
passed
on
regardless
of
her
screams
.
Or
else
he
would
see
a
room
*NL*
in
a
rich
house
,
where
his
friend
lay
asleep
,
dreaming
and
smiling
*NL*
at
his
dreams
;
and
then
the
door
of
that
room
would
be
opened
,
the
*NL*
curtains
of
the
bed
plucked
apart
,
the
sleeper
recalled
,
and
lo
!
*NL*
there
would
stand
by
his
side
a
figure
to
whom
power
was
given
,
and
*NL*
even
at
that
dead
hour
,
he
must
rise
and
do
its
bidding
.
The
figure
*NL*
in
these
two
phases
haunted
the
lawyer
all
night
;
and
if
at
any
time
*NL*
he
dozed
over
,
it
was
but
to
see
it
glide
more
stealthily
through
*NL*
sleeping
houses
,
or
move
the
more
swiftly
and
still
the
more
*NL*
swiftly
,
even
to
dizziness
,
through
wider
labyrinths
of
lamplighted
*NL*
city
,
and
at
every
street-corner
crush
a
child
and
leave
her
*NL*
screaming
.
And
still
the
figure
had
no
face
by
which
he
might
know
*NL*
it
;
even
in
his
dreams
,
it
had
no
face
,
or
one
that
baffled
him
and
*NL*
melted
before
his
eyes
;
and
thus
it
was
that
there
sprang
up
and
*NL*
grew
apace
in
the
lawyer
's
mind
a
singularly
strong
,
almost
an
*NL*
inordinate
,
curiosity
to
behold
the
features
of
the
real
Mr.
Hyde
.
*NL*
If
he
could
but
once
set
eyes
on
him
,
he
thought
the
mystery
would
*NL*
lighten
and
perhaps
roll
altogether
away
,
as
was
the
habit
of
*NL*
mysterious
*NL*
*NL*
16
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
things
when
well
examined
.
He
might
see
a
reason
for
his
friend
's
*NL*
strange
preference
or
bondage
-LRB-
call
it
which
you
please
-RRB-
and
even
*NL*
for
the
startling
clause
of
the
will
.
At
least
it
would
be
a
face
*NL*
worth
seeing
:
the
face
of
a
man
who
was
without
bowels
of
mercy
:
a
*NL*
face
which
had
but
to
show
itself
to
raise
up
,
in
the
mind
of
the
*NL*
unimpressionable
Enfield
,
a
spirit
of
enduring
hatred
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
that
time
forward
,
Mr.
Utterson
began
to
haunt
the
door
in
the
*NL*
by-street
of
shops
.
In
the
morning
before
office
hours
,
at
noon
when
*NL*
business
was
plenty
,
and
time
scarce
,
at
night
under
the
face
of
the
*NL*
fogged
city
moon
,
by
all
lights
and
at
all
hours
of
solitude
or
*NL*
concourse
,
the
lawyer
was
to
be
found
on
his
chosen
post
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
he
be
Mr.
Hyde
,
''
he
had
thought
,
``
I
shall
be
Mr.
Seek
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
at
last
his
patience
was
rewarded
.
It
was
a
fine
dry
night
;
*NL*
frost
in
the
air
;
the
streets
as
clean
as
a
ballroom
floor
;
the
*NL*
lamps
,
unshaken
,
by
any
wind
,
drawing
a
regular
pattern
of
light
*NL*
and
shadow
.
By
ten
o'clock
,
when
the
shops
were
closed
,
the
*NL*
by-street
was
very
solitary
and
,
in
spite
of
the
low
growl
of
*NL*
London
from
all
round
,
very
silent
.
Small
sounds
carried
far
;
*NL*
domestic
sounds
out
of
the
houses
were
clearly
audible
on
either
*NL*
side
of
the
roadway
;
and
the
rumour
of
the
approach
of
any
*NL*
passenger
preceded
him
by
a
long
time
.
Mr.
Utterson
had
been
some
*NL*
minutes
at
his
post
,
when
he
was
*NL*
*NL*
17
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
aware
of
an
odd
,
light
footstep
drawing
near
.
In
the
course
of
his
*NL*
nightly
patrols
,
he
had
long
grown
accustomed
to
the
quaint
effect
*NL*
with
which
the
footfalls
of
a
single
person
,
while
he
is
still
a
*NL*
great
way
off
,
suddenly
spring
out
distinct
from
the
vast
hum
and
*NL*
clatter
of
the
city
.
Yet
his
attention
had
never
before
been
so
*NL*
sharply
and
decisively
arrested
;
and
it
was
with
a
strong
,
*NL*
superstitious
prevision
of
success
that
he
withdrew
into
the
entry
*NL*
of
the
court
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
steps
drew
swiftly
nearer
,
and
swelled
out
suddenly
louder
as
*NL*
they
turned
the
end
of
the
street
.
The
lawyer
,
looking
forth
from
*NL*
the
entry
,
could
soon
see
what
manner
of
man
he
had
to
deal
with
.
*NL*
He
was
small
and
very
plainly
dressed
,
and
the
look
of
him
,
even
at
*NL*
that
distance
,
went
somehow
strongly
against
the
watcher
's
*NL*
inclination
.
But
he
made
straight
for
the
door
,
crossing
the
*NL*
roadway
to
save
time
;
and
as
he
came
,
he
drew
a
key
from
his
pocket
*NL*
like
one
approaching
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Utterson
stepped
out
and
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
as
he
*NL*
passed
.
``
Mr.
Hyde
,
I
think
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Hyde
shrank
back
with
a
hissing
intake
of
the
breath
.
But
his
*NL*
fear
was
only
momentary
;
and
though
he
did
not
look
the
lawyer
in
*NL*
the
face
,
he
answered
coolly
enough
:
``
That
is
my
name
.
What
do
you
*NL*
want
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
you
are
going
in
,
''
returned
the
lawyer
.
``
I
am
an
old
friend
*NL*
of
Dr.
Jekyll
's
--
Mr.
Utter
-
*NL*
*NL*
18
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
son
of
Gaunt
Street
--
you
must
have
heard
my
name
;
and
meeting
you
*NL*
so
conveniently
,
I
thought
you
might
admit
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
not
find
Dr.
Jekyll
;
he
is
from
home
,
''
replied
Mr.
Hyde
,
*NL*
blowing
in
the
key
.
And
then
suddenly
,
but
still
without
looking
up
,
*NL*
``
How
did
you
know
me
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
your
side
,
''
said
Mr.
Utterson
,
``
will
you
do
me
a
favour
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
pleasure
,
''
replied
the
other
.
``
What
shall
it
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
let
me
see
your
face
?
''
asked
the
lawyer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Hyde
appeared
to
hesitate
,
and
then
,
as
if
upon
some
sudden
*NL*
reflection
,
fronted
about
with
an
air
of
defiance
;
and
the
pair
*NL*
stared
at
each
other
pretty
fixedly
for
a
few
seconds
.
``
Now
I
shall
*NL*
know
you
again
,
''
said
Mr.
Utterson
.
``
It
may
be
useful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
returned
Mr.
Hyde
,
``
it
is
as
well
we
have
,
met
;
and
a
*NL*
propos
,
you
should
have
my
address
.
''
And
he
gave
a
number
of
a
*NL*
street
in
Soho
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
God
!
''
thought
Mr.
Utterson
,
``
can
he
,
too
,
have
been
thinking
*NL*
of
the
will
?
''
But
he
kept
his
feelings
to
himself
and
only
grunted
*NL*
in
acknowledgment
of
the
address
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
''
said
the
other
,
``
how
did
you
know
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
description
,
''
was
the
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whose
description
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
19
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
common
friends
,
''
said
Mr.
Utterson
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Common
friends
?
''
echoed
Mr.
Hyde
,
a
little
hoarsely
.
``
Who
are
*NL*
they
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jekyll
,
for
instance
,
''
said
the
lawyer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
never
told
you
,
''
cried
Mr.
Hyde
,
with
a
flush
of
anger
.
``
I
did
*NL*
not
think
you
would
have
lied
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
''
said
Mr.
Utterson
,
``
that
is
not
fitting
language
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
snarled
aloud
into
a
savage
laugh
;
and
the
next
moment
,
*NL*
with
extraordinary
quickness
,
he
had
unlocked
the
door
and
*NL*
disappeared
into
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lawyer
stood
awhile
when
Mr.
Hyde
had
left
him
,
the
picture
of
*NL*
disquietude
.
Then
he
began
slowly
to
mount
the
street
,
pausing
*NL*
every
step
or
two
and
putting
his
hand
to
his
brow
like
a
man
in
*NL*
mental
perplexity
.
The
problem
he
was
thus
debating
as
he
walked
,
*NL*
was
one
of
a
class
that
is
rarely
solved
.
Mr.
Hyde
was
pale
and
*NL*
dwarfish
,
he
gave
an
impression
of
deformity
without
any
nameable
*NL*
malformation
,
he
had
a
displeasing
smile
,
he
had
borne
himself
to
*NL*
the
lawyer
with
a
sort
of
murderous
mixture
of
timidity
and
*NL*
boldness
,
and
he
spoke
with
a
husky
,
whispering
and
somewhat
broken
*NL*
voice
;
all
these
were
points
against
him
,
but
not
all
of
these
*NL*
together
could
explain
the
hitherto
unknown
disgust
,
loathing
,
and
*NL*
fear
with
which
Mr.
Utterson
regarded
him
.
``
There
must
be
some
-
*NL*
*NL*
20
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
thing
else
,
''
said
the
perplexed
gentleman
.
``
There
is
something
*NL*
more
,
if
I
could
find
a
name
for
it
.
God
bless
me
,
the
man
seems
*NL*
hardly
human
!
Something
troglodytic
,
shall
we
say
?
or
can
it
be
the
*NL*
old
story
of
Dr.
Fell
?
or
is
it
the
mere
radiance
of
a
foul
soul
*NL*
that
thus
transpires
through
,
and
transfigures
,
its
clay
continent
?
*NL*
The
last
,
I
think
;
for
,
O
my
poor
old
Harry
Jekyll
,
if
ever
I
read
*NL*
Satan
's
signature
upon
a
face
,
it
is
on
that
of
your
new
friend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Round
the
corner
from
the
by-street
,
there
was
a
square
of
ancient
,
*NL*
handsome
houses
,
now
for
the
most
part
decayed
from
their
high
*NL*
estate
and
let
in
flats
and
chambers
to
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
*NL*
men
:
map-engravers
,
architects
,
shady
lawyers
,
and
the
agents
of
*NL*
obscure
enterprises
.
One
house
,
however
,
second
from
the
corner
,
was
*NL*
still
occupied
entire
;
and
at
the
door
of
this
,
which
wore
a
great
*NL*
air
of
wealth
and
comfort
,
though
it
was
now
plunged
in
darkness
*NL*
except
for
the
fan-light
,
Mr.
Utterson
stopped
and
knocked
.
A
*NL*
well-dressed
,
elderly
servant
opened
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Dr.
Jekyll
at
home
,
Poole
?
''
asked
the
lawyer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
see
,
Mr.
Utterson
,
''
said
Poole
,
admitting
the
visitor
,
as
*NL*
he
spoke
,
into
a
large
,
low-roofed
,
comfortable
hall
,
paved
with
*NL*
flags
,
warmed
-LRB-
after
the
fashion
of
a
country
house
-RRB-
by
a
bright
,
*NL*
open
fire
,
and
furnished
with
costly
cabinets
of
oak
.
``
Will
you
*NL*
wait
here
by
the
*NL*
*NL*
21
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
fire
,
sir
?
or
shall
I
give
you
a
light
in
the
dining
room
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
thank
you
,
''
said
the
lawyer
,
and
he
drew
near
and
leaned
on
*NL*
the
tall
fender
.
This
hall
,
in
which
he
was
now
left
alone
,
was
a
*NL*
pet
fancy
of
his
friend
the
doctor
's
;
and
Utterson
himself
was
wont
*NL*
to
speak
of
it
as
the
pleasantest
room
in
London
.
But
to-night
there
*NL*
was
a
shudder
in
his
blood
;
the
face
of
Hyde
sat
heavy
on
his
*NL*
memory
;
he
felt
-LRB-
what
was
rare
with
him
-RRB-
a
nausea
and
distaste
of
*NL*
life
;
and
in
the
gloom
of
his
spirits
,
he
seemed
to
read
a
menace
in
*NL*
the
flickering
of
the
firelight
on
the
polished
cabinets
and
the
*NL*
uneasy
starting
of
the
shadow
on
the
roof
.
He
was
ashamed
of
his
*NL*
relief
,
when
Poole
presently
returned
to
announce
that
Dr.
Jekyll
*NL*
was
gone
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
saw
Mr.
Hyde
go
in
by
the
old
dissecting-room
door
,
Poole
,
''
he
*NL*
said
.
``
Is
that
right
,
when
Dr.
Jekyll
is
from
home
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
right
,
Mr.
Utterson
,
sir
,
''
replied
the
servant
.
``
Mr.
Hyde
*NL*
has
a
key
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
master
seems
to
repose
a
great
deal
of
trust
in
that
young
*NL*
man
,
Poole
,
''
resumed
the
other
musingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
he
do
indeed
,
''
said
Poole
.
``
We
have
all
orders
to
obey
*NL*
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
think
I
ever
met
Mr.
Hyde
?
''
asked
Utterson
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
dear
no
,
sir
.
He
never
dines
here
,
''
replied
the
butler
.
``
Indeed
*NL*
we
see
very
little
of
*NL*
*NL*
22
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
him
on
this
side
of
the
house
;
he
mostly
comes
and
goes
by
the
*NL*
laboratory
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
good-night
,
Poole
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-night
,
Mr.
Utterson
.
''
And
the
lawyer
set
out
homeward
with
a
*NL*
very
heavy
heart
.
``
Poor
Harry
Jekyll
,
''
he
thought
,
``
my
mind
*NL*
misgives
me
he
is
in
deep
waters
!
He
was
wild
when
he
was
young
;
a
*NL*
long
while
ago
to
be
sure
;
but
in
the
law
of
God
,
there
is
no
*NL*
statute
of
limitations
.
Ay
,
it
must
be
that
;
the
ghost
of
some
old
*NL*
sin
,
the
cancer
of
some
concealed
disgrace
:
punishment
coming
,
PEDE
*NL*
CLAUDO
,
years
after
memory
has
forgotten
and
self-love
condoned
the
*NL*
fault
.
''
And
the
lawyer
,
scared
by
the
thought
,
brooded
a
while
on
*NL*
his
own
past
,
groping
in
all
the
corners
of
memory
,
lest
by
chance
*NL*
some
Jack-in-the-Box
of
an
old
iniquity
should
leap
to
light
there
.
*NL*
His
past
was
fairly
blameless
;
few
men
could
read
the
rolls
of
their
*NL*
life
with
less
apprehension
;
yet
he
was
humbled
to
the
dust
by
the
*NL*
many
ill
things
he
had
done
,
and
raised
up
again
into
a
sober
and
*NL*
fearful
gratitude
by
the
many
that
he
had
come
so
near
to
doing
,
yet
*NL*
avoided
.
And
then
by
a
return
on
his
former
subject
,
he
conceived
a
*NL*
spark
of
hope
.
``
This
Master
Hyde
,
if
he
were
studied
,
''
thought
he
,
*NL*
``
must
have
secrets
of
his
own
;
black
secrets
,
by
the
look
of
him
;
*NL*
secrets
compared
to
which
poor
Jekyll
's
worst
would
be
like
*NL*
sunshine
.
Things
can
not
continue
as
they
are
.
It
turns
me
cold
to
*NL*
think
of
this
creature
stealing
like
a
*NL*
*NL*
23
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
thief
to
Harry
's
bedside
;
poor
Harry
,
what
a
wakening
!
And
the
*NL*
danger
of
it
;
for
if
this
Hyde
suspects
the
existence
of
the
will
,
*NL*
he
may
grow
impatient
to
inherit
.
Ay
,
I
must
put
my
shoulder
to
the
*NL*
wheel
if
Jekyll
will
but
let
me
,
''
he
added
,
``
if
Jekyll
will
only
let
*NL*
me
.
''
For
once
more
he
saw
before
his
mind
's
eye
,
as
clear
as
a
*NL*
transparency
,
the
strange
clauses
of
the
will
.
*NL*
*NL*
24
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
DR.
JEKYLL
WAS
QUITE
AT
EASE
*NL*
*NL*
A
FORTNIGHT
later
,
by
excellent
good
fortune
,
the
doctor
gave
one
*NL*
of
his
pleasant
dinners
to
some
five
or
six
old
cronies
,
all
*NL*
intelligent
,
reputable
men
and
all
judges
of
good
wine
;
and
Mr.
*NL*
Utterson
so
contrived
that
he
remained
behind
after
the
others
had
*NL*
departed
.
This
was
no
new
arrangement
,
but
a
thing
that
had
*NL*
befallen
many
scores
of
times
.
Where
Utterson
was
liked
,
he
was
*NL*
liked
well
.
Hosts
loved
to
detain
the
dry
lawyer
,
when
the
*NL*
light-hearted
and
the
loose-tongued
had
already
their
foot
on
the
*NL*
threshold
;
they
liked
to
sit
a
while
in
his
unobtrusive
company
,
*NL*
practising
for
solitude
,
sobering
their
minds
in
the
man
's
rich
*NL*
silence
after
the
expense
and
strain
of
gaiety
.
To
this
rule
,
Dr.
*NL*
Jekyll
was
no
exception
;
and
as
he
now
sat
on
the
opposite
side
of
*NL*
the
fire
--
a
large
,
well-made
,
smooth-faced
man
of
fifty
,
with
*NL*
something
of
a
slyish
cast
perhaps
,
but
every
mark
of
capacity
and
*NL*
kindness
--
you
could
see
by
his
looks
that
he
cherished
for
Mr.
*NL*
Utterson
a
sincere
and
warm
affection
.
*NL*
*NL*
25
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
wanting
to
speak
to
you

Jekyll
,
''
began
the
latter
.
*NL*
``
You
know
that
will
of
yours
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
close
observer
might
have
gathered
that
the
topic
was
*NL*
distasteful
;
but
the
doctor
carried
it
off

``
My
poor
*NL*
Utterson

said
he
,
``
you
are
unfortunate
in
such
a
client

I
never

saw
a
man
so
distressed
as
you
were

unless
it
were
that
*NL*
hide-bound
pedant

Lanyon

he
called
my

*NL*
Oh

I
know
he
's
a
good

you
need
n't
frown
--
an
excellent
*NL*
fellow

and
I
always
mean
to
see
more
of
him

a
hide-bound

pedant
for

an
ignorant

*NL*
``
You

I
never

ruthlessly

disregarding
the
fresh
topic

*NL*
*NL*
``
My

Yes

certainly

the

a

*NL*
sharply

You
have
told
me
so

Well

The
large
handsome
face
of
Dr.

grew
pale
to
the
very
lips

there
came
a
blackness
about
his
eyes

``
I
do
not

he

the

with

incoherency

of
manner
.
``
I
am
painfully
situated

Utterson

a

strange

a

*NL*

looking
in

*NL*
``
I

no

perfectly

he
said
at
last

getting
*NL*
to
his
feet

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

for

I
hope

continued
the

``
there
is
one
point

him

he
told

I

I
do
sincerely

take
a
great
,
a

Utterson

I
wish

promise
me
that
you
will
bear
*NL*
with

get
his

I
think
you
would

all

it
would
be
a

THE
CAREW
MURDER
CASE
*NL*
*NL*
NEARLY
a
year
later
,
in
the
month
of
October
,
18
--
,
London
was
*NL*
startled
by
a
crime
of
singular
ferocity
and
rendered
all
the
more
*NL*
notable
by
the
high
position
of
the
victim
.
The
details
were
few
and
*NL*
startling
.
A
maid
servant
living
alone
in
a
house
not
far
from
the
*NL*
river
,
had
gone
up-stairs
to
bed
about
eleven
.
Although
a
fog
rolled
*NL*
over
the
city
in
the
small
hours
,
the
early
part
of
the
night
was
*NL*
cloudless
,
and
the
lane
,
which
the
maid
's
window
overlooked
,
was
*NL*
brilliantly
lit
by
the
full
moon
.
It
seems
she
was
romantically
*NL*
given
,
for
she
sat
down
upon
her
box
,
which
stood
immediately
under
*NL*
the
window
,
and
fell
into
a
dream
of
musing
.
Never
-LRB-
she
used
to
say
,
*NL*
with
streaming
tears
,
when
she
narrated
that
experience
-RRB-
,
never
had
*NL*
she
felt
more
at
peace
with
all
men
or
thought
more
kindly
of
the
*NL*
world
.
And
as
she
so
sat
she
became
aware
of
an
aged
and
beautiful
*NL*
gentleman
with
white
hair
,
drawing
near
along
the
lane
;
and
*NL*
advancing
to
meet
him
,
another
and
very
small
gentleman
,
to
whom
at
*NL*
first
she
*NL*
*NL*
29
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
paid
less
attention
.
When
they
had
come
within
speech
-LRB-
which
was
*NL*
just
under
the
maid
's
eyes
-RRB-
the
older
man
bowed
and
accosted
the
*NL*
other
with
a
very
pretty
manner
of
politeness
.
It
did
not
seem
as
*NL*
if
the
subject
of
his
address
were
of
great
importance
;
indeed
,
*NL*
from
his
pointing
,
it
sometimes
appeared
as
if
he
were
only
*NL*
inquiring
his
way
;
but
the
moon
shone
on
his
face
as
he
spoke
,
and
*NL*
the
girl
was
pleased
to
watch
it
,
it
seemed
to
breathe
such
an
*NL*
innocent
and
old-world
kindness
of
disposition
,
yet
with
something
*NL*
high
too
,
as
of
a
well-founded
self-content
.
Presently
her
eye
*NL*
wandered
to
the
other
,
and
she
was
surprised
to
recognise
in
him
a
*NL*
certain
Mr.
Hyde
,
who
had
once
visited
her
master
and
for
whom
she
*NL*
had
conceived
a
dislike
.
He
had
in
his
hand
a
heavy
cane
,
with
which
*NL*
he
was
trifling
;
but
he
answered
never
a
word
,
and
seemed
to
listen
*NL*
with
an
ill-contained
impatience
.
And
then
all
of
a
sudden
he
broke
*NL*
out
in
a
great
flame
of
anger
,
stamping
with
his
foot
,
brandishing
*NL*
the
cane
,
and
carrying
on
-LRB-
as
the
maid
described
it
-RRB-
like
a
madman
.
*NL*
The
old
gentleman
took
a
step
back
,
with
the
air
of
one
very
much
*NL*
surprised
and
a
trifle
hurt
;
and
at
that
Mr.
Hyde
broke
out
of
all
*NL*
bounds
and
clubbed
him
to
the
earth
.
And
next
moment
,
with
ape-like
*NL*
fury
,
he
was
trampling
his
victim
under
foot
and
hailing
down
a
*NL*
storm
of
blows
,
under
which
the
bones
were
audibly
shattered
and
the
*NL*
body
jumped
upon
the
roadway
.
At
the
horror
of
these
sights
and
*NL*
sounds
,
the
maid
fainted
.
*NL*
*NL*
30
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
two
o'clock
when
she
came
to
herself
and
called
for
the
*NL*
police
.
The
murderer
was
gone
long
ago
;
but
there
lay
his
victim
in
*NL*
the
middle
of
the
lane
,
incredibly
mangled
.
The
stick
with
which
the
*NL*
deed
had
been
done
,
although
it
was
of
some
rare
and
very
tough
and
*NL*
heavy
wood
,
had
broken
in
the
middle
under
the
stress
of
this
*NL*
insensate
cruelty
;
and
one
splintered
half
had
rolled
in
the
*NL*
neighbouring
gutter
--
the
other
,
without
doubt
,
had
been
carried
*NL*
away
by
the
murderer
.
A
purse
and
a
gold
watch
were
found
upon
the
*NL*
victim
:
but
no
cards
or
papers
,
except
a
sealed
and
stamped
*NL*
envelope
,
which
he
had
been
probably
carrying
to
the
post
,
and
which
*NL*
bore
the
name
and
address
of
Mr.
Utterson
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
brought
to
the
lawyer
the
next
morning
,
before
he
was
out
*NL*
of
bed
;
and
he
had
no
sooner
seen
it
,
and
been
told
the
*NL*
circumstances
,
than
he
shot
out
a
solemn
lip
.
``
I
shall
say
nothing
*NL*
till
I
have
seen
the
body
,
''
said
he
;
``
this
may
be
very
serious
.
Have
*NL*
the
kindness
to
wait
while
I
dress
.
''
And
with
the
same
grave
*NL*
countenance
he
hurried
through
his
breakfast
and
drove
to
the
police
*NL*
station
,
whither
the
body
had
been
carried
.
As
soon
as
he
came
into
*NL*
the
cell
,
he
nodded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
recognise
him
.
I
am
sorry
to
say
that
this
is
*NL*
Sir
Danvers
Carew
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
God
,
sir
,
''
exclaimed
the
officer
,
``
is
it
possible
?
''
And
the
*NL*
next
moment
his
eye
*NL*
*NL*
31
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
lighted
up
with
professional
ambition
.
``
This
will
make
a
deal
of
*NL*
noise
,
''
he
said
.
``
And
perhaps
you
can
help
us
to
the
man
.
''
And
he
*NL*
briefly
narrated
what
the
maid
had
seen
,
and
showed
the
broken
*NL*
stick
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Utterson
had
already
quailed
at
the
name
of
Hyde
;
but
when
the
*NL*
stick
was
laid
before
him
,
he
could
doubt
no
longer
;
broken
and
*NL*
battered
as
it
was
,
he
recognised
it
for
one
that
he
had
himself
*NL*
presented
many
years
before
to
Henry
Jekyll
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
this
Mr.
Hyde
a
person
of
small
stature
?
''
he
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Particularly
small
and
particularly
wicked-looking
,
is
what
the
*NL*
maid
calls
him
,
''
said
the
officer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Utterson
reflected
;
and
then
,
raising
his
head
,
``
If
you
will
*NL*
come
with
me
in
my
cab
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
think
I
can
take
you
to
his
*NL*
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
by
this
time
about
nine
in
the
morning
,
and
the
first
fog
of
*NL*
the
season
.
A
great
chocolate-coloured
pall
lowered
over
heaven
,
but
*NL*
the
wind
was
continually
charging
and
routing
these
embattled
*NL*
vapours
;
so
that
as
the
cab
crawled
from
street
to
street
,
Mr.
*NL*
Utterson
beheld
a
marvellous
number
of
degrees
and
hues
of
twilight
;
*NL*
for
here
it
would
be
dark
like
the
back-end
of
evening
;
and
there
*NL*
would
be
a
glow
of
a
rich
,
lurid
brown
,
like
the
light
of
some
*NL*
strange
conflagration
;
and
here
,
for
a
moment
,
the
fog
would
be
*NL*
quite
broken
up
,
and
a
haggard
shaft
*NL*
*NL*
32
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
of
daylight
would
glance
in
between
the
swirling
wreaths
.
The
*NL*
dismal
quarter
of
Soho
seen
under
these
changing
glimpses
,
with
its
*NL*
muddy
ways
,
and
slatternly
passengers
,
and
its
lamps
,
which
had
*NL*
never
been
extinguished
or
had
been
kindled
afresh
to
combat
this
*NL*
mournful
re-invasion
of
darkness
,
seemed
,
in
the
lawyer
's
eyes
,
like
*NL*
a
district
of
some
city
in
a
nightmare
.
The
thoughts
of
his
mind
,
*NL*
besides
,
were
of
the
gloomiest
dye
;
and
when
he
glanced
at
the
*NL*
companion
of
his
drive
,
he
was
conscious
of
some
touch
of
that
*NL*
terror
of
the
law
and
the
law
's
officers
,
which
may
at
times
assail
*NL*
the
most
honest
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
cab
drew
up
before
the
address
indicated
,
the
fog
lifted
a
*NL*
little
and
showed
him
a
dingy
street
,
a
gin
palace
,
a
low
French
*NL*
eating-house
,
a
shop
for
the
retail
of
penny
numbers
and
twopenny
*NL*
salads
,
many
ragged
children
huddled
in
the
doorways
,
and
many
*NL*
women
of
different
nationalities
passing
out
,
key
in
hand
,
to
have
a
*NL*
morning
glass
;
and
the
next
moment
the
fog
settled
down
again
upon
*NL*
that
part
,
as
brown
as
umber
,
and
cut
him
off
from
his
blackguardly
*NL*
surroundings
.
This
was
the
home
of
Henry
Jekyll
's
favourite
;
of
a
*NL*
man
who
was
heir
to
a
quarter
of
a
million
sterling
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
ivory-faced
and
silvery-haired
old
woman
opened
the
door
.
She
*NL*
had
an
evil
face
,
smoothed
by
hypocrisy
;
but
her
manners
were
*NL*
excellent
.
Yes
,
she
said
,
this
was
Mr.
Hyde
's
,
but
he
was
not
at
*NL*
home
;
he
had
been
in
that
night
very
late
,
*NL*
*NL*
33
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
but
had
gone
away
again
in
less
than
an
hour
;
there
was
nothing
*NL*
strange
in
that
;
his
habits
were
very
irregular
,
and
he
was
often
*NL*
absent
;
for
instance
,
it
was
nearly
two
months
since
she
had
seen
*NL*
him
till
yesterday
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
then
,
we
wish
to
see
his
rooms
,
''
said
the
lawyer
;
and
*NL*
when
the
woman
began
to
declare
it
was
impossible
,
``
I
had
better
*NL*
tell
you
who
this
person
is
,
''
he
added
.
``
This
is
Inspector
Newcomen
*NL*
of
Scotland
Yard

odious
joy
appeared
upon
the
woman
's
face
.
``
Ah
!
''
said
*NL*
she
,
``
he
is
in
trouble
!
What
has
he
done
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Utterson
and
the
inspector
exchanged
glances
.
``
He
do
n't
seem
a
*NL*
very
popular
character
,
''
observed
the
latter
.
``
And
now
,
my
good
*NL*
woman
,
just
let
me
and
this
gentleman
have
a
look
about
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
whole
extent
of
the
house
,
which
but
for
the
old
woman
*NL*
remained
otherwise
empty
,
Mr.
Hyde
had
only
used
a
couple
of
rooms
;
*NL*
but
these
were
furnished
with
luxury
and
good
taste
.
A
closet
was
*NL*
filled
with
wine
;
the
plate
was
of
silver
,
the
napery
elegant
;
a
*NL*
good
picture
hung
upon
the
walls
,
a
gift
-LRB-
as
Utterson
supposed
-RRB-
from
*NL*
Henry
Jekyll
,
who
was
much
of
a
connoisseur
;
and
the
carpets
were
of
*NL*
many
plies
and
agreeable
in
colour
.
At
this
moment
,
however
,
the
*NL*
rooms
bore
every
mark
of
having
been
recently
and
hurriedly
*NL*
ransacked
;
clothes
lay
about
the
floor
,
with
their
pockets
inside
*NL*
out
;
*NL*
*NL*
34
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
lock-fast
drawers
stood
open
;
and
on
the
hearth
there
lay
a
pile
of
*NL*
grey
ashes
,
as
though
many
papers
had
been
burned
.
From
these
*NL*
embers
the
inspector
disinterred
the
butt-end
of
a
green
*NL*
cheque-book
,
which
had
resisted
the
action
of
the
fire
;
the
other
*NL*
half
of
the
stick
was
found
behind
the
door
;
and
as
this
clinched
*NL*
his
suspicions
,
the
officer
declared
himself
delighted
.
A
visit
to
*NL*
the
bank
,
where
several
thousand
pounds
were
found
to
be
lying
to
*NL*
the
murderer
's
credit
,
completed
his
gratification
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
depend
upon
it
,
sir
,
''
he
told
Mr.
Utterson
:
``
I
have
him
in
*NL*
my
hand
.
He
must
have
lost
his
head
,
or
he
never
would
have
left
the
*NL*
stick
or
,
above
all
,
burned
the
cheque-book
.
Why
,
money
's
life
to
*NL*
the
man
.
We
have
nothing
to
do
but
wait
for
him
at
the
bank
,
and
get
*NL*
out
the
handbills
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
last
,
however
,
was
not
so
easy
of
accomplishment
;
for
Mr.
Hyde
*NL*
had
numbered
few
familiars
--
even
the
master
of
the
servant-maid
*NL*
had
only
seen
him
twice
;
his
family
could
nowhere
be
traced
;
he
had
*NL*
never
been
photographed
;
and
the
few
who
could
describe
him
differed
*NL*
widely
,
as
common
observers
will
.
Only
on
one
point
,
were
they
*NL*
agreed
;
and
that
was
the
haunting
sense
of
unexpressed
deformity
*NL*
with
which
the
fugitive
impressed
his
beholders
.

INCIDENT
OF
THE
LETTER
*NL*
*NL*
IT
was
late
in
the
afternoon
,
when
Mr.
Utterson
found
his
way
to
*NL*
Dr.
Jekyll
's
door
,
where
he
was
at
once
admitted
by
Poole
,
and
*NL*
carried
down
by
the
kitchen
offices
and
across
a
yard
which
had
*NL*
once
been
a
garden
,
to
the
building
which
was
indifferently
known
*NL*
as
the
laboratory
or
the
dissecting-rooms
.
The
doctor
had
bought
*NL*
the
house
from
the
heirs
of
a
celebrated
surgeon
;
and
his
own
*NL*
tastes
being
rather
chemical
than
anatomical
,
had
changed
the
*NL*
destination
of
the
block
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
.
It
was
the
*NL*
first
time
that
the
lawyer
had
been
received
in
that
part
of
his
*NL*
friend
's
quarters
;
and
he
eyed
the
dingy
,
windowless
structure
with
*NL*
curiosity
,
and
gazed
round
with
a
distasteful
sense
of
strangeness
*NL*
as
he
crossed
the
theatre
,
once
crowded
with
eager
students
and
now
*NL*
lying
gaunt
and
silent
,
the
tables
laden
with
chemical
apparatus
,
*NL*
the
floor
strewn
with
crates
and
littered
with
packing
straw
,
and
*NL*
the
light
falling
dimly
through
the
foggy
cupola
.
At
the
further
*NL*
end
,
a
flight
of
stairs
mounted
to
a
door
covered
with
red
baize
;
*NL*
*NL*
36
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
and
through
this
,
Mr.
Utterson
was
at
last
received
into
the
*NL*
doctor
's
cabinet
.
It
was
a
large
room
,
fitted
round
with
glass
*NL*
presses
,
furnished
,
among
other
things
,
with
a
cheval-glass
and
a
*NL*
business
table
,
and
looking
out
upon
the
court
by
three
dusty
*NL*
windows
barred
with
iron
.
A
fire
burned
in
the
grate
;
a
lamp
was
*NL*
set
lighted
on
the
chimney
shelf
,
for
even
in
the
houses
the
fog
*NL*
began
to
lie
thickly
;
and
there
,
close
up
to
the
warmth
,
sat
Dr.
*NL*
Jekyll
,
looking
deadly
sick
.
He
did
not
rise
to
meet
his
visitor
,
*NL*
but
held
out
a
cold
hand
and
bade
him
welcome
in
a
changed
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
''
said
Mr.
Utterson
,
as
soon
as
Poole
had
left
them
,
``
you
*NL*
have
heard
the
news
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
shuddered
.
``
They
were
crying
it
in
the
square
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
``
I
heard
them
in
my
dining-room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
word
,
''
said
the
lawyer
.
``
Carew
was
my
client
,
but
so
are
you
,
*NL*
and
I
want
to
know
what
I
am
doing
.
You
have
not
been
mad
enough
to
*NL*
hide
this
fellow
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Utterson
,
I
swear
to
God
,
''
cried
the
doctor
,
``
I
swear
to
God
I
*NL*
will
never
set
eyes
on
him
again
.
I
bind
my
honour
to
you
that
I
am
*NL*
done
with
him
in
this
world
.
It
is
all
at
an
end
.
And
indeed
he
does
*NL*
not
want
my
help
;
you
do
not
know
him
as
I
do
;
he
is
safe
,
he
is
*NL*
quite
safe
;
mark
my
words
,
he
will
never
more
be
heard
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
lawyer
listened
gloomily
;
he
did
not
like
his
friend
's
feverish
*NL*
manner
.
``
You
seem
pretty
*NL*
*NL*
37
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
sure
of
him
,
''
said
he
;
``
and
for
your
sake
,
I
hope
you
may
be
right
.
*NL*
If
it
came
to
a
trial
,
your
name
might
appear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
quite
sure
of
him
,
''
replied
Jekyll
;
``
I
have
grounds
for
*NL*
certainty
that
I
can
not
share
with
any
one
.
But
there
is
one
thing
*NL*
on
which
you
may
advise
me
.
I
have
--
I
have
received
a
letter
;
and
*NL*
I
am
at
a
loss
whether
I
should
show
it
to
the
police
.
I
should
like
*NL*
to
leave
it
in
your
hands
,
Utterson
;
you
would
judge
wisely
,
I
am
*NL*
sure
;
I
have
so
great
a
trust
in
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
fear
,
I
suppose
,
that
it
might
lead
to
his
detection
?
''
asked
*NL*
the
lawyer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
the
other
.
``
I
can
not
say
that
I
care
what
becomes
of
*NL*
Hyde
;
I
am
quite
done
with
him
.
I
was
thinking
of
my
own
character
,
*NL*
which
this
hateful
business
has
rather
exposed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Utterson
ruminated
a
while
;
he
was
surprised
at
his
friend
's
*NL*
selfishness
,
and
yet
relieved
by
it
.
``
Well
,
''
said
he
,
at
last
,
``
let
*NL*
me
see
the
letter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
letter
was
written
in
an
odd
,
upright
hand
and
signed
``
Edward
*NL*
Hyde
''
:
and
it
signified
,
briefly
enough
,
that
the
writer
's
*NL*
benefactor
,
Dr.
Jekyll
,
whom
he
had
long
so
unworthily
repaid
for
a
*NL*
thousand
generosities
,
need
labour
under
no
alarm
for
his
safety
,
as
*NL*
he
had
means
of
escape
on
which
he
placed
a
sure
dependence
.
The
*NL*
lawyer
liked
this
letter
well
enough
;
it
put
a
better
colour
on
the
*NL*
intimacy
than
he
had
looked
for
;
and
he
blamed
himself
for
some
of
*NL*
his
past
suspicions
.
*NL*
*NL*
38
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
the
envelope
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
burned
it
,
''
replied
Jekyll
,
``
before
I
thought
what
I
was
about
.
*NL*
But
it
bore
no
postmark
.
The
note
was
handed
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
keep
this
and
sleep
upon
it
?
''
asked
Utterson
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
you
to
judge
for
me
entirely
,
''
was
the
reply
.
``
I
have
lost
*NL*
confidence
in
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
shall
consider
,
''
returned
the
lawyer
.
``
And
now
one
word
*NL*
more
:
it
was
Hyde
who
dictated
the
terms
in
your
will
about
that
*NL*
disappearance
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
seemed
seized
with
a
qualm
of
faintness
:
he
shut
his
*NL*
mouth
tight
and
nodded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
it
,
''
said
Utterson
.
``
He
meant
to
murder
you
.
You
have
had
a
*NL*
fine
escape
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
had
what
is
far
more
to
the
purpose
,
''
returned
the
doctor
*NL*
solemnly
:
``
I
have
had
a
lesson
--
O
God
,
Utterson
,
what
a
lesson
I
*NL*
have
had
!
''
And
he
covered
his
face
for
a
moment
with
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
his
way
out
,
the
lawyer
stopped
and
had
a
word
or
two
with
*NL*
Poole
.
``
By
the
by
,
''
said
he
,
``
there
was
a
letter
handed
in
to-day
:
*NL*
what
was
the
messenger
like
?
''
But
Poole
was
positive
nothing
had
*NL*
come
except
by
post
;
``
and
only
circulars
by
that
,
''
he
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
news
sent
off
the
visitor
with
his
fears
renewed
.
Plainly
the
*NL*
letter
had
come
by
the
laboratory
door
;
possibly
,
indeed
,
it
had
*NL*
been
*NL*
*NL*
39
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
written
in
the
cabinet
;
and
if
that
were
so
,
it
must
be
differently
*NL*
judged
,
and
handled
with
the
more
caution
.
The
newsboys
,
as
he
went
,
*NL*
were
crying
themselves
hoarse
along
the
footways
:
``
Special
edition
.
*NL*
Shocking
murder
of
an
M.
P.
''
That
was
the
funeral
oration
of
one
*NL*
friend
and
client
;
and
he
could
not
help
a
certain
apprehension
lest
*NL*
the
good
name
of
another
should
be
sucked
down
in
the
eddy
of
the
*NL*
scandal
.
It
was
,
at
least
,
a
ticklish
decision
that
he
had
to
make
;
*NL*
and
self-reliant
as
he
was
by
habit
,
he
began
to
cherish
a
longing
*NL*
for
advice
.
It
was
not
to
be
had
directly
;
but
perhaps
,
he
thought
,
*NL*
it
might
be
fished
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
after
,
he
sat
on
one
side
of
his
own
hearth
,
with
Mr.
*NL*
Guest
,
his
head
clerk
,
upon
the
other
,
and
midway
between
,
at
a
*NL*
nicely
calculated
distance
from
the
fire
,
a
bottle
of
a
particular
*NL*
old
wine
that
had
long
dwelt
unsunned
in
the
foundations
of
his
*NL*
house
.
The
fog
still
slept
on
the
wing
above
the
drowned
city
,
where
*NL*
the
lamps
glimmered
like
carbuncles
;
and
through
the
muffle
and
*NL*
smother
of
these
fallen
clouds
,
the
procession
of
the
town
's
life
*NL*
was
still
rolling
in
through
the
great
arteries
with
a
sound
as
of
a
*NL*
mighty
wind
.
But
the
room
was
gay
with
firelight
.
In
the
bottle
the
*NL*
acids
were
long
ago
resolved
;
the
imperial
dye
had
softened
with
*NL*
time
,
As
the
colour
grows
richer
in
stained
windows
;
and
the
glow
of
*NL*
hot
autumn
afternoons
on
hillside
vineyards
was
ready
to
be
set
free
*NL*
*NL*
40
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
and
to
disperse
the
fogs
of
London
.
Insensibly
the
lawyer
melted
.
*NL*
There
was
no
man
from
whom
he
kept
fewer
secrets
than
Mr.
Guest
;
*NL*
and
he
was
not
always
sure
that
he
kept
as
many
as
he
meant
.
Guest
*NL*
had
often
been
on
business
to
the
doctor
's
;
he
knew
Poole
;
he
could
*NL*
scarce
have
failed
to
hear
of
Mr.
Hyde
's
familiarity
about
the
*NL*
house
;
he
might
draw
conclusions
:
was
it
not
as
well
,
then
,
that
he
*NL*
should
see
a
letter
which
put
that
mystery
to
rights
?
and
above
all
*NL*
since
Guest
,
being
a
great
student
and
critic
of
handwriting
,
would
*NL*
consider
the
step
natural
and
obliging
?
The
clerk
,
besides
,
was
a
*NL*
man
of
counsel
;
he
would
scarce
read
so
strange
a
document
without
*NL*
dropping
a
remark
;
and
by
that
remark
Mr.
Utterson
might
shape
his
*NL*
future
course
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
a
sad
business
about
Sir
Danvers
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
indeed
.
It
has
elicited
a
great
deal
of
public
feeling
,
''
*NL*
returned
Guest
.
``
The
man
,
of
course
,
was
mad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
to
hear
your
views
on
that
,
''
replied
Utterson
.
``
I
*NL*
have
a
document
here
in
his
handwriting
;
it
is
between
ourselves
,
*NL*
for
I
scarce
know
what
to
do
about
it
;
it
is
an
ugly
business
at
*NL*
the
best
.
But
there
it
is
;
quite
in
your
way
a
murderer
's
*NL*
autograph
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Guest
's
eyes
brightened
,
and
he
sat
down
at
once
and
studied
it
*NL*
with
passion
.
``
No
,
sir
,
''
he
said
:
``
not
mad
;
but
it
is
an
odd
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
41
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
by
all
accounts
a
very
odd
writer
,
''
added
the
lawyer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
then
the
servant
entered
with
a
note
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
from
Dr.
Jekyll
,
sir
?
''
inquired
the
clerk
.
``
I
thought
I
*NL*
knew
the
writing

Anything

*NL*
*NL*
``
One
moment

I
thank
you

;
and
the
clerk
laid
the
two
sheets
*NL*
of
paper
alongside
and
sedulously
compared
their
contents
.
``
Thank

said
at

,
returning
both

``
it

*NL*

There
was
a
pause
,
during
which
Mr.
Utterson
struggled
with
*NL*
himself
.
``
Why
did
you
compare
them

''
he
inquired
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,

''
returned
the
clerk
,
``
there
's
a
rather
singular

identical

*NL*
*NL*
``

Utterson

*NL*
*NL*
``
It

*NL*
*NL*
``

the

*NL*
``

said
the

But
no

was
Mr.

alone
that
night
than
he
locked
the

note
into
his
safe
,
where
it
reposed
from

*NL*
``

thought

REMARKABLE
INCIDENT
OF
DR.
LANYON
*NL*
*NL*
TIME
ran
on
;
thousands
of
pounds
were
offered
in
reward
,
for
the
*NL*
death
of
Sir
Danvers
was
resented
as
a
public
injury
;
but
Mr.
Hyde
*NL*
had
disappeared
out
of
the
ken
of
the
police
as
though
he
had
never
*NL*
existed
.
Much
of
his
past
was
unearthed
,
indeed
,
and
all
*NL*
disreputable
:
tales
came
out
of
the
man
's
cruelty
,
at
once
so
*NL*
callous
and
violent
;
of
his
vile
life
,
of
his
strange
associates
,
*NL*
of
the
hatred
that
seemed
to
have
surrounded
his
career
;
but
of
his
*NL*
present
whereabouts
,
not
a
whisper
.
From
the
time
he
had
left
the
*NL*
house
in
Soho
on
the
morning
of
the
murder
,
he
was
simply
blotted
*NL*
out
;
and
gradually
,
as
time
drew
on
,
Mr.
Utterson
began
to
recover
*NL*
from
the
hotness
of
his
alarm
,
and
to
grow
more
at
quiet
with
*NL*
himself
.
The
death
of
Sir
Danvers
was
,
to
his
way
of
thinking
,
more
*NL*
than
paid
for
by
the
disappearance
of
Mr.
Hyde
.
Now
that
that
evil
*NL*
influence
had
been
withdrawn
,
a
new
life
began
for
Dr.
Jekyll
.
He
*NL*
came
out
of
his
seclusion
,
renewed
relations
with
his
friends
,
*NL*
became
once
more
their
familiar
guest
*NL*
*NL*
43
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
and
entertainer
;
and
whilst
he
had
always
been
known
for
*NL*
charities
,
he
was
now
no
less
distinguished
for
religion
.
He
was
*NL*
busy
,
he
was
much
in
the
open
air
,
he
did
good
;
his
face
seemed
to
*NL*
open
and
brighten
,
as
if
with
an
inward
consciousness
of
service
;
*NL*
and
for
more
than
two
months
,
the
doctor
was
at
peace
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
8th
of
January
Utterson
had
dined
at
the
doctor
's
with
a
*NL*
small
party
;
Lanyon
had
been
there
;
and
the
face
of
the
host
had
*NL*
looked
from
one
to
the
other
as
in
the
old
days
when
the
trio
were
*NL*
inseparable
friends
.
On
the
12th
,
and
again
on
the
14th
,
the
door
*NL*
was
shut
against
the
lawyer
.
``
The
doctor
was
confined
to
the
*NL*
house
,
''
Poole
said
,
``
and
saw
no
one
.
''
On
the
15th
,
he
tried
again
,
*NL*
and
was
again
refused
;
and
having
now
been
used
for
the
last
two
*NL*
months
to
see
his
friend
almost
daily
,
he
found
this
return
of
*NL*
solitude
to
weigh
upon
his
spirits
.
The
fifth
night
he
had
in
Guest
*NL*
to
dine
with
him
;
and
the
sixth
he
betook
himself
to
Dr.
Lanyon
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
at
least
he
was
not
denied
admittance
;
but
when
he
came
in
,
*NL*
he
was
shocked
at
the
change
which
had
taken
place
in
the
doctor
's
*NL*
appearance
.
He
had
his
death-warrant
written
legibly
upon
his
face
.
*NL*
The
rosy
man
had
grown
pale
;
his
flesh
had
fallen
away
;
he
was
*NL*
visibly
balder
and
older
;
and
yet
it
was
not
so
much
,
these
tokens
*NL*
of
a
swift
physical
decay
that
arrested
the
lawyer
's
notice
,
as
a
*NL*
look
in
the
eye
and
quality
of
manner
that
seemed
to
testify
to
*NL*
*NL*
44
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
some
deep-seated
terror
of
the
mind
.
It
was
unlikely
that
the
*NL*
doctor
should
fear
death
;
and
yet
that
was
what
Utterson
was
*NL*
tempted
to
suspect
.
``
Yes
,
''
he
thought
;
``
he
is
a
doctor
,
he
must
*NL*
know
his
own
state
and
that
his
days
are
counted
;
and
the
knowledge
*NL*
is
more
than
he
can
bear
.
''
And
yet
when
Utterson
remarked
on
his
*NL*
ill-looks
,
it
was
with
an
air
of
greatness
that
Lanyon
declared
*NL*
himself
a
doomed
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
had
a
shock
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
I
shall
never
recover
.
It
is
a
*NL*
question
of
weeks
.
Well
,
life
has
been
pleasant
;
I
liked
it
;
yes
,
*NL*
sir
,
I
used
to
like
it
.
I
sometimes
think
if
we
knew
all
,
we
should
*NL*
be
more
glad
to
get
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jekyll
is
ill
,
too
,
''
observed
Utterson
.
``
Have
you
seen
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Lanyon
's
face
changed
,
and
he
held
up
a
trembling
hand
.
``
I
wish
*NL*
to
see
or
hear
no
more
of
Dr.
Jekyll
,
''
he
said
in
a
loud
,
unsteady
*NL*
voice
.
``
I
am
quite
done
with
that
person
;
and
I
beg
that
you
will
*NL*
spare
me
any
allusion
to
one
whom
I
regard
as
dead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tut-tut
,
''
said
Mr.
Utterson
;
and
then
after
a
considerable
pause
,
*NL*
``
Ca
n't
I
do
anything
?
''
he
inquired
.
``
We
are
three
very
old
friends
,
*NL*
Lanyon
;
we
shall
not
live
to
make
others
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
can
be
done
,
''
returned
Lanyon
;
``
ask
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
will
not
see
me
,
''
said
the
lawyer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
surprised
at
that
,
''
was
the
reply
.
``
Some
day
,
Utterson
,
*NL*
after
I
am
dead
,
you
may
*NL*
*NL*
45
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
perhaps
come
to
learn
the
right
and
wrong
of
this
.
I
can
not
tell
*NL*
you
.
And
in
the
meantime
,
if
you
can
sit
and
talk
with
me
of
other
*NL*
things
,
for
God
's
sake
,
stay
and
do
so
;
but
if
you
can
not
keep
clear
*NL*
of
this
accursed
topic
,
then
,
in
God
's
name
,
go
,
for
I
can
not
bear
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
he
got
home
,
Utterson
sat
down
and
wrote
to
Jekyll
,
*NL*
complaining
of
his
exclusion
from
the
house
,
and
asking
the
cause
*NL*
of
this
unhappy
break
with
Lanyon
;
and
the
next
day
brought
him
a
*NL*
long
answer
,
often
very
pathetically
worded
,
and
sometimes
darkly
*NL*
mysterious
in
drift
.
The
quarrel
with
Lanyon
was
incurable
.
``
I
do
*NL*
not
blame
our
old
friend
,
''
Jekyll
wrote
,
``
but
I
share
his
view
*NL*
that
we
must
never
meet
.
I
mean
from
henceforth
to
lead
a
life
of
*NL*
extreme
seclusion
;
you
must
not
be
surprised
,
nor
must
you
doubt
*NL*
my
friendship
,
if
my
door
is
often
shut
even
to
you
.
You
must
*NL*
suffer
me
to
go
my
own
dark
way
.
I
have
brought
on
myself
a
*NL*
punishment
and
a
danger
that
I
can
not
name
.
If
I
am
the
chief
of
*NL*
sinners
,
I
am
the
chief
of
sufferers
also
.
I
could
not
think
that
*NL*
this
earth
contained
a
place
for
sufferings
and
terrors
so
*NL*
unmanning
;
and
you
can
do
but
one
thing
,
Utterson
,
to
lighten
*NL*
this
destiny
,
and
that
is
to
respect
my
silence
.
''
Utterson
was
*NL*
amazed
;
the
dark
influence
of
Hyde
had
been
withdrawn
,
the
doctor
*NL*
had
returned
to
his
old
tasks
and
amities
;
a
week
ago
,
the
*NL*
prospect
had
smiled
with
every
promise
of
a
cheerful
and
an
*NL*
honoured
age
;
*NL*
*NL*
46
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
and
now
in
a
moment
,
friendship
,
and
peace
of
mind
,
and
the
whole
*NL*
tenor
of
his
life
were
wrecked
.
So
great
and
unprepared
a
change
*NL*
pointed
to
madness
;
but
in
view
of
Lanyon
's
manner
and
words
,
*NL*
there
must
lie
for
it
some
deeper
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
week
afterwards
Dr.
Lanyon
took
to
his
bed
,
and
in
something
*NL*
less
than
a
fortnight
he
was
dead
.
The
night
after
the
funeral
,
*NL*
at
which
he
had
been
sadly
affected
,
Utterson
locked
the
door
of
*NL*
his
business
room
,
and
sitting
there
by
the
light
of
a
melancholy
*NL*
candle
,
drew
out
and
set
before
him
an
envelope
addressed
by
the
*NL*
hand
and
sealed
with
the
seal
of
his
dead
friend
.
``
PRIVATE
:
for
*NL*
the
hands
of
G.
J.
Utterson
ALONE
and
in
case
of
his
predecease
*NL*
to
be
destroyed
unread
,
''
so
it
was
emphatically
superscribed
;
and
*NL*
the
lawyer
dreaded
to
behold
the
contents
.
``
I
have
buried
one
*NL*
friend
to-day
,
''
he
thought
:
``
what
if
this
should
cost
me
*NL*
another
?
''
And
then
he
condemned
the
fear
as
a
disloyalty
,
and
*NL*
broke
the
seal
.
Within
there
was
another
enclosure
,
likewise
*NL*
sealed
,
and
marked
upon
the
cover
as
``
not
to
be
opened
till
the
*NL*
death
or
disappearance
of
Dr.
Henry
Jekyll
.
''
Utterson
could
not
*NL*
trust
his
eyes
.
Yes
,
it
was
disappearance
;
here
again
,
as
in
the
*NL*
mad
will
which
he
had
long
ago
restored
to
its
author
,
here
again
*NL*
were
the
idea
of
a
disappearance
and
the
name
of
Henry
Jekyll
*NL*
bracketed
.
But
in
the
will
,
that
idea
had
sprung
from
the
*NL*
sinister
suggestion
of
*NL*
*NL*
47
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
the
man
Hyde
;
it
was
set
there
with
a
purpose
all
too
plain
and
*NL*
horrible
.
Written
by
the
hand
of
Lanyon
,
what
should
it
mean
?
A
*NL*
great
curiosity
came
on
the
trustee
,
to
disregard
the
prohibition
*NL*
and
dive
at
once
to
the
bottom
of
these
mysteries
;
but
*NL*
professional
honour
and
faith
to
his
dead
friend
were
stringent
*NL*
obligations
;
and
the
packet
slept
in
the
inmost
corner
of
his
*NL*
private
safe
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
one
thing
to
mortify
curiosity
,
another
to
conquer
it
;
and
*NL*
it
may
be
doubted
if
,
from
that
day
forth
,
Utterson
desired
the
*NL*
society
of
his
surviving
friend
with
the
same
eagerness
.
He
*NL*
thought
of
him
kindly
;
but
his
thoughts
were
disquieted
and
*NL*
fearful
.
He
went
to
call
indeed
;
but
he
was
perhaps
relieved
to
*NL*
be
denied
admittance
;
perhaps
,
in
his
heart
,
he
preferred
to
*NL*
speak
with
Poole
upon
the
doorstep
and
surrounded
by
the
air
and
*NL*
sounds
of
the
open
city
,
rather
than
to
be
admitted
into
that
*NL*
house
of
voluntary
bondage
,
and
to
sit
and
speak
with
its
*NL*
inscrutable
recluse
.
Poole
had
,
indeed
,
no
very
pleasant
news
to
*NL*
communicate
.
The
doctor
,
it
appeared
,
now
more
than
ever
confined
*NL*
himself
to
the
cabinet
over
the
laboratory
,
where
he
would
*NL*
sometimes
even
sleep
;
he
was
out
of
spirits
,
he
had
grown
very
*NL*
silent
,
he
did
not
read
;
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
something
on
his
*NL*
mind
.
Utterson
became
so
used
to
the
unvarying
character
of
these
*NL*
reports
,
that
he
fell
off
little
by
little
in
the
frequency
of
*NL*
his
visits

INCIDENT
AT
THE
WINDOW
*NL*
*NL*
IT
chanced
on
Sunday
,
when
Mr.
Utterson
was
on
his
usual
walk
*NL*
with
Mr.
Enfield
,
that
their
way
lay
once
again
through
the
*NL*
by-street
;
and
that
when
they
came
in
front
of
the
door
,
both
*NL*
stopped
to
gaze
on
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

''
said
Enfield
,
``
that

's
at
an
end
at

We
shall
*NL*
never
see
more
of
Mr.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
not

said
Utterson
.
``
Did
I
ever
tell
you

I
once
saw

him
,
and
shared
your
feeling
of
repulsion
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
impossible
to
do
the
one
without
the
other
,
''
returned
*NL*
Enfield
.
``
And
by
the
way
,
what
an
ass
you
must
have
thought
me
,
*NL*
not
to
know
that
this
was
a
back
way
to
Dr.
Jekyll
's
!
It
was
*NL*
partly
your
own
fault
that
I
found
it
out
,
even
when
I
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
found
it
out
,
did
you
?
''
said
Utterson
.
``
But
if
that
be
*NL*
so
,
we
may
step
into
the
court
and
take
a
look
at
the
windows

To
*NL*
tell
you
the
truth
,
I
am
uneasy
about
poor
Jekyll
;
and
even
*NL*
outside
,
I
feel
as
if
the
presence
of
a
friend
might
do
him

good

The

was
very
cool
and
a
little
damp
,

full
of
premature

twilight
,
although
the

,
high
up
overhead
,
was
still
bright
*NL*
with
sunset
.
The
middle
one
of
the
three
windows
was
half-way
*NL*
open
;
and
sitting
close
beside
it
,
taking
the
air
with
an
*NL*
infinite
sadness
of
mien
,
like
some
disconsolate
prisoner
,
*NL*
Utterson
saw
Dr.
Jekyll
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
Jekyll
!
''
he
cried
.
``
I
trust
you
are
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
low
,
Utterson
,
''
replied
the
doctor
,
drearily
,
``
very
*NL*
low
.
It
will
not
last
long
,
thank
God
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
stay
too
much
indoors
,
''
said
the
lawyer
.
``
You
should
be
out
,
*NL*
whipping
up
the
circulation
like
Mr.
Enfield
and
me
.
-LRB-
This
is
my
*NL*
cousin
--
Mr.
Enfield
--
Dr.
Jekyll
.
-RRB-
Come
,
now
;
get
your
hat
and
*NL*
take
a
quick
turn
with
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very
good
,
''
sighed
the
other
.
``
I
should
like
to
very
*NL*
much
;
but
no
,
no
,
no
,
it
is
quite
impossible
;
I
dare
not
.
But
*NL*
indeed
,
Utterson
,
I
am
very
glad
to
see
you
;
this
is
really
a
*NL*
great
pleasure
;
I
would
ask
you
and
Mr.
Enfield
up
,
but
the
place
*NL*
is
really
not
fit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
then
,
''
said
the
lawyer
,
good-naturedly
,
``
the
best
thing
we
*NL*
can
do
is
to
stay
down
here
and
speak
with
you
from
where
we
*NL*
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
just
what
I
was
about
to
venture
to
propose
,
''
returned
*NL*
the
doctor
with
a
smile
.
But
the
words
were
hardly
uttered
,
*NL*
before
the
smile
was
struck
out
of
his
face
and
succeeded
*NL*
*NL*
50
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
by
an
expression
of
such
abject
terror
and
despair
,
as
froze
the
*NL*
very
blood
of
the
two
gentlemen
below
.
They
saw
it
but
for
a
*NL*
glimpse
,
for
the
window
was
instantly
thrust
down
;
but
that
*NL*
glimpse
had
been
sufficient
,
and
they
turned
and
left
the
court
*NL*
without
a
word
.
In
silence
,
too
,
they
traversed
the
by-street
;
*NL*
and
it
was
not
until
they
had
come
into
a
neighbouring
*NL*
thoroughfare
,
where
even
upon
a
Sunday
there
were
still
some
*NL*
stirrings
of
life
,
that
Mr.
Utterson
at
last
turned
and
looked
at
*NL*
his
companion
.
They
were
both
pale
;
and
there
was
an
answering
*NL*
horror
in
their
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
forgive
us
,
God
forgive
us
,
''
said
Mr.
Utterson
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Mr.
Enfield
only
nodded
his
head
very
seriously
and
walked
on
*NL*
once
more
in
silence
.

THE
LAST
NIGHT
*NL*
*NL*
MR.
UTTERSON
was
sitting
by
his
fireside
one
evening
after
*NL*
dinner
,
when
he
was
surprised
to
receive
a
visit
from
Poole
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bless
me
,
Poole
,
what
brings
you
here
?
''
he
cried
;
and
then
*NL*
taking
a
second
look
at
him
,
``
What
ails
you
?
''
he
added
;
``
is
the
*NL*
doctor
ill
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Utterson
,
''
said
the
man
,
``
there
is
something
wrong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
a
seat
,
and
here
is
a
glass
of
wine
for
you
,
''
said
the
*NL*
lawyer
.
``
Now
,
take
your
time
,
and
tell
me
plainly
what
you
want
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
the
doctor
's
ways
,
sir
,
''
replied
Poole
,
``
and
how
he
*NL*
shuts
himself
up
.
Well
,
he
's
shut
up
again
in
the
cabinet
;
and
I
*NL*
do
n't
like
it
,
sir
--
I
wish
I
may
die
if
I
like
it
.
Mr.
Utterson
,
*NL*
sir
,
I
'm
afraid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
my
good
man
,
''
said
the
lawyer
,
``
be
explicit
.
What
are
you
*NL*
afraid
of
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
been
afraid
for
about
a
week
,
''
returned
Poole
,
doggedly
*NL*
disregarding
the
question
,
``
and
I
can
bear
it
no
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
's
appearance
amply
bore
out
his
*NL*
*NL*
52
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
words
;
his
manner
was
altered
for
the
worse
;
and
except
for
the
*NL*
moment
when
he
had
first
announced
his
terror
,
he
had
not
once
*NL*
looked
the
lawyer
in
the
face
.
Even
now
,
he
sat
with
the
glass
of
*NL*
wine
untasted
on
his
knee
,
and
his
eyes
directed
to
a
corner
of
*NL*
the
floor
.
``
I
can
bear
it
no
more
,
''
he
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
''
said
the
lawyer
,
``
I
see
you
have
some
good
reason
,
Poole
;
*NL*
I
see
there
is
something
seriously
amiss
.
Try
to
tell
me
what
it
*NL*
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
there
's
been
foul
play
,
''
said
Poole
,
hoarsely
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Foul
play
!
''
cried
the
lawyer
,
a
good
deal
frightened
and
rather
*NL*
inclined
to
be
irritated
in
consequence
.
``
What
foul
play
?
What
*NL*
does
the
man
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dare
n't
say
,
sir
,
''
was
the
answer
;
``
but
will
you
come
along
*NL*
with
me
and
see
for
yourself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Utterson
's
only
answer
was
to
rise
and
get
his
hat
and
*NL*
great-coat
;
but
he
observed
with
wonder
the
greatness
of
the
*NL*
relief
that
appeared
upon
the
butler
's
face
,
and
perhaps
with
no
*NL*
less
,
that
the
wine
was
still
untasted
when
he
set
it
down
to
*NL*
follow
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
wild
,
cold
,
seasonable
night
of
March
,
with
a
pale
moon
,
*NL*
lying
on
her
back
as
though
the
wind
had
tilted
her
,
and
a
flying
*NL*
wrack
of
the
most
diaphanous
and
lawny
texture
.
The
wind
made
*NL*
talking
difficult
,
and
flecked
the
blood
into
the
face
.
It
seemed
*NL*
to
have
swept
the
*NL*
*NL*
53
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
streets
unusually
bare
of
passengers
,
besides
;
for
Mr.
Utterson
*NL*
thought
he
had
never
seen
that
part
of
London
so
deserted
.
He
*NL*
could
have
wished
it
otherwise
;
never
in
his
life
had
he
been
*NL*
conscious
of
so
sharp
a
wish
to
see
and
touch
his
*NL*
fellow-creatures
;
for
struggle
as
he
might
,
there
was
borne
in
*NL*
upon
his
mind
a
crushing
anticipation
of
calamity
.
The
square
,
*NL*
when
they
got
there
,
was
all
full
of
wind
and
dust
,
and
the
thin
*NL*
trees
in
the
garden
were
lashing
themselves
along
the
railing
.
*NL*
Poole
,
who
had
kept
all
the
way
a
pace
or
two
ahead
,
now
pulled
*NL*
up
in
the
middle
of
the
pavement
,
and
in
spite
of
the
biting
*NL*
weather
,
took
off
his
hat
and
mopped
his
brow
with
a
red
*NL*
pocket-handkerchief
.
But
for
all
the
hurry
of
his
coming
,
these
*NL*
were
not
the
dews
of
exertion
that
he
wiped
away
,
but
the
*NL*
moisture
of
some
strangling
anguish
;
for
his
face
was
white
and
*NL*
his
voice
,
when
he
spoke
,
harsh
and
broken
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
''
he
said
,
``
here
we
are
,
and
God
grant
there
be
*NL*
nothing
wrong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Amen
,
Poole
,
''
said
the
lawyer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thereupon
the
servant
knocked
in
a
very
guarded
manner
;
the
door
*NL*
was
opened
on
the
chain
;
and
a
voice
asked
from
within
,
``
Is
that
*NL*
you
,
Poole
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
right
,
''
said
Poole
.
``
Open
the
door
.
''
The
hall
,
when
*NL*
they
entered
it
,
was
brightly
lighted
up
;
the
fire
was
built
*NL*
high
;
and
about
the
hearth
the
whole
of
the
servants
,
men
and
*NL*
*NL*
54
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
women
,
stood
huddled
together
like
a
flock
of
sheep
.
At
the
sight
*NL*
of
Mr.
Utterson
,
the
housemaid
broke
into
hysterical
whimpering
;
*NL*
and
the
cook
,
crying
out
,
``
Bless
God
!
it
's
Mr.
Utterson
,
''
ran
*NL*
forward
as
if
to
take
him
in
her
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
what
?
Are
you
all
here
?
''
said
the
lawyer
peevishly
.
``
Very
*NL*
irregular
,
very
unseemly
;
your
master
would
be
far
from
pleased
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
all
afraid
,
''
said
Poole
.
*NL*
*NL*
Blank
silence
followed
,
no
one
protesting
;
only
the
maid
lifted
*NL*
up
her
voice
and
now
wept
loudly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
your
tongue
!
''
Poole
said
to
her
,
with
a
ferocity
of
accent
*NL*
that
testified
to
his
own
jangled
nerves
;
and
indeed
,
when
the
*NL*
girl
had
so
suddenly
raised
the
note
of
her
lamentation
,
they
had
*NL*
all
started
and
turned
toward
the
inner
door
with
faces
of
*NL*
dreadful
expectation
.
``
And
now
,
''
continued
the
butler
,
addressing
*NL*
the
knife-boy
,
``
reach
me
a
candle
,
and
we
'll
get
this
through
*NL*
hands
at
once
.
''
And
then
he
begged
Mr.
Utterson
to
follow
him
,
*NL*
and
led
the
way
to
the
back-garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
sir
,
''
said
he
,
``
you
come
as
gently
as
you
can
.
I
want
you
*NL*
to
hear
,
and
I
do
n't
want
you
to
be
heard
.
And
see
here
,
sir
,
if
*NL*
by
any
chance
he
was
to
ask
you
in
,
do
n't
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Utterson
's
nerves
,
at
this
unlooked-for
termination
,
gave
a
*NL*
jerk
that
nearly
threw
him
from
his
balance
;
but
he
re-collected
*NL*
his
courage
*NL*
*NL*
55
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
and
followed
the
butler
into
the
laboratory
building
and
through
*NL*
the
surgical
theatre
,
with
its
lumber
of
crates
and
bottles
,
to
*NL*
the
foot
of
the
stair
.
Here
Poole
motioned
him
to
stand
on
one
*NL*
side
and
listen
;
while
he
himself
,
setting
down
the
candle
and
*NL*
making
a
great
and
obvious
call
on
his
resolution
,
mounted
the
*NL*
steps
and
knocked
with
a
somewhat
uncertain
hand
on
the
red
baize
*NL*
of
the
cabinet
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Utterson
,
sir
,
asking
to
see
you
,
''
he
called
;
and
even
as
he
*NL*
did
so
,
once
more
violently
signed
to
the
lawyer
to
give
ear
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
voice
answered
from
within
:
``
Tell
him
I
can
not
see
any
one
,
''
it
*NL*
said
complainingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
sir
,
''
said
Poole
,
with
a
note
of
something
like
*NL*
triumph
in
his
voice
;
and
taking
up
his
candle
,
he
led
Mr.
*NL*
Utterson
back
across
the
yard
and
into
the
great
kitchen
,
where
*NL*
the
fire
was
out
and
the
beetles
were
leaping
on
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
he
said
,
looking
Mr.
Utterson
in
the
eyes
,
``
was
that
my
*NL*
master
's
voice
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
much
changed

''
replied
the
lawyer
,
very
pale
,
but
*NL*
giving
look
for
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Changed
?
Well
,
yes
,
I
think
so
,
''
said
the
butler
.
``
Have
I
been

twenty

cry
out

God

*NL*
who
's
in
there
instead
of
him

why

cries
to

Mr.

biting
his
finger

it

it

been
crying
*NL*
night
and
day
for
some
sort
of
medicine

can
not
get
it
to

It
was
sometimes
his
way

the

that
is

to
*NL*
write
his
orders
on

sheet

We

nothing

would

to

carefully

Its
contents
ran
thus
:
``
Dr.
*NL*
Jekyll
presents
his
compliments
to
Messrs.
Maw
.
He
assures
them
*NL*
that
their
last
sample
is
impure
and
quite
useless
for
his
*NL*
present
purpose
.
In
the
year
18
--
,
Dr.
J.
purchased
a
somewhat
*NL*
large
quantity
from
Messrs.
M
.
He
now
begs
them
to
search
with
*NL*
the
most
sedulous
care
,
and
should
any
of
the
same
quality
be
*NL*
left
,
to
forward
it
to
him
at
once
.
Expense
is
no
consideration
.
*NL*
The
importance
of
this
to
Dr.
J.
can
hardly
be
exaggerated
.
''
So
*NL*
far
the
letter
had
run
composedly
enough
,
but
here
with
a
sudden
*NL*
splutter
of
the
pen
,
the
writer
's
emotion
had
broken
loose
.
``
For
*NL*
God
's
sake
,
''
he
had
added
,
``
find
me
some
of
the
old
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
a
strange
note
,
''
said
Mr.
Utterson
;
and
then
sharply
,
*NL*
``
How
do
you
come
to
have
it
open
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
man
at
Maw
's
was
main
angry
,
sir
,
and
he
threw
it
back
to
me
*NL*
like
so
much
dirt
,
''
returned
Poole
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
unquestionably
the
doctor
's
hand
,
do
you
know
?
''
resumed
*NL*
the
lawyer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
it
looked
like
it
,
''
said
the
servant
rather
sulkily
;
*NL*
and
then
,
with
another
voice
,
``
But
what
matters
hand-of-write
?
''
*NL*
he
said
.
``
I
've
seen
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Seen
him
?
''
repeated
Mr.
Utterson
.
``
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
it
!
''
said
Poole
.
``
It
was
this
way
.
I
came
suddenly
into
*NL*
the
theatre
from
the
*NL*
*NL*
58
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
garden
.
It
seems
he
had
slipped
out
to
look
for
this
drug
or
*NL*
whatever
it
is
;
for
the
cabinet
door
was
open
,
and
there
he
was
*NL*
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
digging
among
the
crates
.
He
looked
up
*NL*
when
I
came
in
,
gave
a
kind
of
cry
,
and
whipped
up-stairs
into
*NL*
the
cabinet
.
It
was
but
for
one
minute
that
I
saw
him
,
but
the
*NL*
hair
stood
upon
my
head
like
quills
.
Sir
,
if
that
was
my
master
,
*NL*
why
had
he
a
mask
upon
his
face
?
If
it
was
my
master
,
why
did
he
*NL*
cry
out
like
a
rat
,
and
run
from
me
?
I
have
served
him
long
*NL*
enough
.
And
then
...
''
The
man
paused
and
passed
his
hand
over
his
*NL*
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
are
all
very
strange
circumstances
,
''
said
Mr.
Utterson
,
*NL*
``
but
I
think
I
begin
to
see
daylight
.
Your
master
,
Poole
,
is
*NL*
plainly
seized
with
one
of
those
maladies
that
both
torture
and
*NL*
deform
the
sufferer
;
hence
,
for
aught
I
know
,
the
alteration
of
*NL*
his
voice
;
hence
the
mask
and
the
avoidance
of
his
friends
;
hence
*NL*
his
eagerness
to
find
this
drug
,
by
means
of
which
the
poor
soul
*NL*
retains
some
hope
of
ultimate
recovery
--
God
grant
that
he
be
*NL*
not
deceived
!
There
is
my
explanation
;
it
is
sad
enough
,
Poole
,
*NL*
ay
,
and
appalling
to
consider
;
but
it
is
plain
and
natural
,
hangs
*NL*
well
together
,
and
delivers
us
from
all
exorbitant
alarms
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
said
the
butler
,
turning
to
a
sort
of
mottled
pallor
,
*NL*
``
that
thing
was
not
my
master
,
and
there
's
the
truth
.
My
master
''
*NL*
here
he
looked
round
him
and
began
to
whisper
--
``
is
*NL*
*NL*
59
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
a
tall
,
fine
build
of
a
man
,
and
this
was
more
of
a
dwarf
.
''
*NL*
Utterson
attempted
to
protest
.
``
O
,
sir
,
''
cried
Poole
,
``
do
you
*NL*
think
I
do
not
know
my
master
after
twenty
years
?
Do
you
think
I
*NL*
do
not
know
where
his
head
comes
to
in
the
cabinet
door
,
where
I
*NL*
saw
him
every
morning
of
my
life
?
No
,
Sir
,
that
thing
in
the
mask
*NL*
was
never
Dr.
Jekyll
--
God
knows
what
it
was
,
but
it
was
never
*NL*
Dr.
Jekyll
;
and
it
is
the
belief
of
my
heart
that
there
was
*NL*
murder
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poole
,
''
replied
the
lawyer
,
``
if
you
say
that
,
it
will
become
my
*NL*
duty
to
make
certain
.
Much
as
I
desire
to
spare
your
master
's
*NL*
feelings
,
much
as
I
am
puzzled
by
this
note
which
seems
to
prove
*NL*
him
to
be
still
alive
,
I
shall
consider
it
my
duty
to
break
in
*NL*
that
door
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
Mr.
Utterson
,
that
's
talking
!
''
cried
the
butler
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
comes
the
second
question
,
''
resumed
Utterson
:
``
Who
is
*NL*
going
to
do
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
and
me
,
''
was
the
undaunted
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
very
well
said
,
''
returned
the
lawyer
;
``
and
whatever
comes
*NL*
of
it
,
I
shall
make
it
my
business
to
see
you
are
no
loser
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
an
axe
in
the
theatre
,
''
continued
Poole
;
``
and
you
might
*NL*
take
the
kitchen
poker
for
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
lawyer
took
that
rude
but
weighty
instrument
into
his
hand
,
*NL*
and
balanced
it
.
``
Do
you
know
,
Poole
,
''
he
said
,
looking
up
,
``
that
*NL*
*NL*
60
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
you
and
I
are
about
to
place
ourselves
in
a
position
of
some
*NL*
peril
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
say
so
,
sir

indeed

returned
the
butler
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
well
,
then
,
that
we
should
be
frank
,
''
said
the
other
.
``
We
*NL*
both
think
more
than
we
have
said
;
let
us
make
a
clean
breast
.
*NL*
This
masked
figure
that
you
saw
,
did
you
recognise
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
it
went
so
quick
,
and
the
creature
was
so
doubled
up
,
*NL*
that
I
could
hardly
swear
to
that
,
''
was
the
answer
.
``
But
if
you
*NL*
mean
,
was
it
Mr.
Hyde
?
--
why
,
yes
,
I
think
it
was
!
You
see
,
it
*NL*
was
much
of
the
same
bigness
;
and
it
had
the
same
quick
,
light
*NL*
way
with
it
;
and
then
who
else
could
have
got
in
by
the
*NL*
laboratory
door
?
You
have
not
forgot
,
sir
that
at
the
time
of
the
*NL*
murder
he
had
still
the
key
with
him
?
But
that
's
not
all
.
I
do
n't

know

Mr.
Utterson

if
ever
you
met
this
Mr.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

said
the
lawyer
,
``
I
once
spoke
with
him

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
must
know
as
well
as
the
rest
of
us
that
there
was

something
queer
about
that
gentleman

something
that
gave
a
man
*NL*
a
turn
--
I
do
n't
know
rightly
how
to
say
it
,
sir
,
beyond
this
:
*NL*
that
you
felt
it
in
your
marrow
kind
of
cold
and
thin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
own
I
felt
something
of
what
you
describe

said
Mr.

.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
so

returned
Poole
.
``
Well

when
*NL*
*NL*
61
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
that
masked
thing
like
a
monkey
jumped
from
among
the
chemicals

and
whipped
into

cabinet

went
down
my
spine
like
ice

Oh

I
know

not
evidence

Mr.

I
'm
book-learned
enough
*NL*
for
that

a
man
has
his
feelings

I
give
you
my
*NL*
Bible-word
it
was
Mr.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay

ay

said
the
lawyer
.
``
My
fears
incline
to
the

point

Evil

I

Ay

I

I

killed

still
lurking
in

Well

let
our

name
be
vengeance

Call
Bradshaw

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
footman
came
at
the
summons
,
very
white
and
nervous
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pull
yourself
together
,
Bradshaw
,
''
said
the
lawyer
.
``
This
*NL*
suspense
,
I
know
,
is
telling
upon
all
of
you

but
it
is
now
our
*NL*
intention
to
make
an
end
of
it
.
Poole
,
here
,
and
I
are
going
to
*NL*
force
our
way
into
the
cabinet

If
all
is
well
,
my
shoulders
are
*NL*
broad
enough
to
bear
the
blame

Meanwhile
,
lest
anything
should
*NL*
really
be
amiss

or
any
malefactor
seek
to
escape
by
the
back
,
*NL*
you
and
the
boy
must
go
round
the
corner
with
a
pair
of
good

sticks

take
your
post
at
the
laboratory
door

We
give
you
ten
*NL*
minutes
to
get
to
your
stations

*NL*
*NL*
As
Bradshaw
left
,
the
lawyer
looked
at
his
watch
.
``
And
now
,
*NL*
Poole
,
let
us
get
to
ours

*NL*
*NL*
62
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
he
said
;
and
taking
the
poker
under
his
arm
,
led
the
way
into
the
*NL*
yard
.
The
scud
had
banked
over
the
moon
,
and
it
was
now
quite
*NL*
dark
.
The
wind
,
which
only
broke
in
puffs
and
draughts
into
that
*NL*
deep
well
of
building
,
tossed
the
light
of
the
candle
to
and
fro
*NL*
about
their
steps
,
until
they
came
into
the
shelter
of
the
*NL*
theatre
,
where
they
sat
down
silently
to
wait
.
London
hummed
*NL*
solemnly
all
around
;
but
nearer
at
hand
,
the
stillness
was
only
*NL*
broken
by
the
sounds
of
a
footfall
moving
to
and
fro
along
the
*NL*
cabinet
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
it
will
walk
all
day
,
sir
,
''
whispered
Poole
;
``
ay
,
and
the
*NL*
better
part
of
the
night
.
Only
when
a
new
sample
comes
from
the
*NL*
chemist
,
there
's
a
bit
of
a
break
.
Ah
,
it
's
an
ill
conscience
*NL*
that
's
such
an
enemy
to
rest
!
Ah
,
sir
,
there
's
blood
foully
shed
*NL*
in
every
step
of
it
!
But
hark
again
,
a
little
closer
--
put
your
*NL*
heart
in
your
ears
,
Mr.
Utterson
,
and
tell
me
,
is
that
the
*NL*
doctor
's
foot
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
steps
fell
lightly
and
oddly
,
with
a
certain
swing
,
for
all
*NL*
they
went
so
slowly
;
it
was
different
indeed
from
the
heavy
*NL*
creaking
tread
of
Henry
Jekyll
.
Utterson
sighed
.
``
Is
there
never
*NL*
anything
else
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poole
nodded
.
``
Once
,
''
he
said
.
``
Once
I
heard
it
weeping
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Weeping
?
how
that
?
''
said
the
lawyer
,
conscious
of
a
sudden
chill
*NL*
of
horror
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Weeping
like
a
woman
or
a
lost
soul

''
said
*NL*
*NL*
63
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
the
butler
.
``
I
came
away
with
that
upon
my
heart
,
that
I
could
*NL*
have
wept
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
now
the
ten
minutes
drew
to
an
end
.
Poole
disinterred
the
axe
*NL*
from
under
a
stack
of
packing
straw
;
the
candle
was
set
upon
the
*NL*
nearest
table
to
light
them
to
the
attack
;
and
they
drew
near
*NL*
with
bated
breath
to
where
that
patient
foot
was
still
going
up
*NL*
and
down
,
up
and
down
,
in
the
quiet
of
the
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

cried
Utterson
,
with
a
loud
voice
,
``
I
demand
to
see

you

He
paused
a
moment
,
but
there
came
no
reply
.
``
I
give
you
*NL*
fair
warning
,
our
suspicions
are
aroused

and
I
must
and
shall

he
resumed
;
``
if
not
by
fair
means
,
then
by
foul
!
if
not
*NL*
of
your
consent
,
then
by

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
the
voice
,
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

that

cried
Utterson
.
*NL*
``
Down
with
the
door

''
*NL*
*NL*
Poole
swung
the
axe
over
his
shoulder
;
the
blow
shook
the
*NL*
building
,
and
the
red
baize
door
leaped
against
the
lock
and
*NL*
hinges
.
A
dismal
screech
,
as
of
mere
animal
terror
,
rang
from
the
*NL*
cabinet
.
Up
went
the
axe
again
,
and
again
the
panels
crashed
and
*NL*
the
frame
bounded
;
four
times
the
blow
fell
;
but
the
wood
was
*NL*
tough
and
the
fittings
were
of
excellent
workmanship
;
and
it
was
*NL*
not
until
the
fifth
,
that
the
lock
burst
in
sunder
and
the
wreck
*NL*
of
the
door
fell
inwards
on
the
carpet
.

*NL*
*NL*
The
besiegers
,
appalled
by
their
own
riot
and
the
stillness
that
*NL*
had
succeeded
,
stood
back
a
little
and
peered
in
.
There
lay
the
*NL*
cabinet
before
their
eyes
in
the
quiet
lamplight
,
a
good
fire
*NL*
glowing
and
chattering
on
the
hearth
,
the
kettle
singing
its
thin
*NL*
strain
,
a
drawer
or
two
open
,
papers
neatly
set
forth
on
the
*NL*
business-table
,
and
nearer
the
fire
,
the
things
laid
out
for
tea
:
*NL*
the
quietest
room
,
you
would
have
said
,
and
,
but
for
the
glazed
*NL*
presses
full
of
chemicals
,
the
most
commonplace
that
night
in
*NL*
London
.
*NL*
*NL*
Right
in
the
midst
there
lay
the
body
of
a
man
sorely
contorted
*NL*
and
still
twitching
.
They
drew
near
on
tiptoe
,
turned
it
on
its
*NL*
back
and
beheld
the
face
of
Edward
Hyde
.
He
was
dressed
in
*NL*
clothes
far
too
large
for
him
,
clothes
of
the
doctor
's
bigness
;
*NL*
the
cords
of
his
face
still
moved
with
a
semblance
of
life
,
but
*NL*
life
was
quite
gone
;
and
by
the
crushed
phial
in
the
hand
and
the
*NL*
strong
smell
of
kernels
that
hung
upon
the
air
,
Utterson
knew
*NL*
that
he
was
looking
on
the
body
of
a
self-destroyer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
come
too
late
,
''
he
said
sternly
,
``
whether
to
save
or
*NL*
punish
.
Hyde
is
gone
to
his
account
;
and
it
only
remains
for
us
*NL*
to
find
the
body
of
your
master
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
far
greater
proportion
of
the
building
was
occupied
by
the
*NL*
theatre
,
which
filled
almost
the
whole
ground
story
and
was
*NL*
lighted
from
above
,
and
by
the
cabinet
,
which
formed
an
upper
*NL*
story
at
one
end
and
looked
upon
the
*NL*
*NL*
65
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
court
.
A
corridor
joined
the
theatre
to
the
door
on
the
*NL*
by-street
;
and
with
this
the
cabinet
communicated
separately
by
a
*NL*
second
flight
of
stairs
.
There
were
besides
a
few
dark
closets
*NL*
and
a
spacious
cellar
.
All
these
they
now
thoroughly
examined
.
*NL*
Each
closet
needed
but
a
glance
,
for
all
were
empty
,
and
all
,
by
*NL*
the
dust
that
fell
from
their
doors
,
had
stood
long
unopened
.
The
*NL*
cellar
,
indeed
,
was
filled
with
crazy
lumber
,
mostly
dating
from
*NL*
the
times
of
the
surgeon
who
was
Jekyll
's
predecessor
;
but
even
*NL*
as
they
opened
the
door
they
were
advertised
of
the
uselessness
*NL*
of
further
search
,
by
the
fall
of
a
perfect
mat
of
cobweb
which
*NL*
had
for
years
sealed
up
the
entrance
.
Nowhere
was
there
any
trace
*NL*
of
Henry
Jekyll
,
dead
or
alive
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poole
stamped
on
the
flags
of
the
corridor
.
``
He
must
be
buried
*NL*
here
,
''
he
said
,
hearkening
to
the
sound
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
he
may
have
fled
,
''
said
Utterson
,
and
he
turned
to
examine
*NL*
the
door
in
the
by-street
.
It
was
locked
;
and
lying
near
by
on
*NL*
the
flags
,
they
found
the
key
,
already
stained
with
rust
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
does
not
look
like
use
,
''
observed
the
lawyer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Use
!
''
echoed
Poole
.
``
Do
you
not
see
,
sir
,
it
is
broken
?
much
as
*NL*
if
a
man
had
stamped
on
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
''
continued
Utterson
,
``
and
the
fractures
,
too
,
are
rusty
.
''
*NL*
The
two
men
looked
at
each
other
with
a
scare
.
``
This
is
beyond
*NL*
me
,
*NL*
*NL*
66
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
Poole
,
''
said
the
lawyer
.
``
Let
us
go
back
to
the
cabinet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
mounted
the
stair
in
silence
,
and
still
with
an
occasional
*NL*
awe-struck
glance
at
the
dead
body
,
proceeded
more
thoroughly
to
*NL*
examine
the
contents
of
the
cabinet
.
At
one
table
,
there
were
*NL*
traces
of
chemical
work
,
various
measured
heaps
of
some
white
*NL*
salt
being
laid
on
glass
saucers
,
as
though
for
an
experiment
in
*NL*
which
the
unhappy
man
had
been
prevented
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
the
same
drug
that
I
was
always
bringing
him
,
''
said
*NL*
Poole
;
and
even
as
he
spoke
,
the
kettle
with
a
startling
noise
*NL*
boiled
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
brought
them
to
the
fireside
,
where
the
easy-chair
was
drawn
*NL*
cosily
up
,
and
the
tea-things
stood
ready
to
the
sitter
's
elbow
,
*NL*
the
very
sugar
in
the
cup
.
There
were
several
books
on
a
shelf
;
*NL*
one
lay
beside
the
tea-things
open
,
and
Utterson
was
amazed
to
*NL*
find
it
a
copy
of
a
pious
work
,
for
which
Jekyll
had
several
*NL*
times
expressed
a
great
esteem
,
annotated
,
in
his
own
hand
,
with
*NL*
startling
blasphemies
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
,
in
the
course
of
their
review
of
the
chamber
,
the
searchers
*NL*
came
to
the
cheval
glass
,
into
whose
depths
they
looked
with
an
*NL*
involuntary
horror
.
But
it
was
so
turned
as
to
show
them
nothing
*NL*
but
the
rosy
glow
playing
on
the
roof
,
the
fire
sparkling
in
a
*NL*
hundred
repetitions
along
the
glazed
front
of
the
presses
,
and
*NL*
their
own
pale
and
fearful
countenances
stooping
to
look
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
67
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
glass
have
seen
some
strange
things
,
sir
,
''
whispered
Poole
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
surely
none
stranger
than
itself
,
''
echoed
the
lawyer
in
the
*NL*
same
tones
.
``
For
what
did
Jekyll
''
--
he
caught
himself
up
at
the
*NL*
word
with
a
start
,
and
then
conquering
the
weakness
--
``
what
*NL*
could
Jekyll
want
with
it
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
say
that
!
''
said
Poole
.
Next
they
turned
to
the
*NL*
business-table
.
On
the
desk
among
the
neat
array
of
papers
,
a
*NL*
large
envelope
was
uppermost
,
and
bore
,
in
the
doctor
's
hand
,
the
*NL*
name
of
Mr.
Utterson
.
The
lawyer
unsealed
it
,
and
several
*NL*
enclosures
fell
to
the
floor
.
The
first
was
a
will
,
drawn
in
the
*NL*
same
eccentric
terms
as
the
one
which
he
had
returned
six
months
*NL*
before
,
to
serve
as
a
testament
in
case
of
death
and
as
a
deed
of
*NL*
gift
in
case
of
disappearance
;
but
,
in
place
of
the
name
of
*NL*
Edward
Hyde
,
the
lawyer
,
with
indescribable
amazement
,
read
the
*NL*
name
of
Gabriel
John
Utterson
.
He
looked
at
Poole
,
and
then
back
*NL*
at
the
paper
,
and
last
of
all
at
the
dead
malefactor
stretched
*NL*
upon
the
carpet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
head
goes
round
,
''
he
said
.
``
He
has
been
all
these
days
in
*NL*
possession
;
he
had
no
cause
to
like
me
;
he
must
have
raged
to
see
*NL*
himself
displaced
;
and
he
has
not
destroyed
this
document
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
caught
up
the
next
paper
;
it
was
a
brief
note
in
the
doctor
's
*NL*
hand
and
dated
at
the
top
.
*NL*
*NL*
68
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
Poole
!
''
the
lawyer
cried
,
``
he
was
alive
and
here
this
day
.
He
*NL*
can
not
have
been
disposed
of
in
so
short
a
space
,
he
must
be
*NL*
still
alive
,
he
must
have
fled
!
And
then
,
why
fled
?
and
how
?
and
*NL*
in
that
case
,
can
we
venture
to
declare
this
suicide
?
Oh
,
we
must
*NL*
be
careful
.
I
foresee
that
we
may
yet
involve
your
master
in
some
*NL*
dire
catastrophe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
read
it
,
sir
?
''
asked
Poole
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
fear
,
''
replied
the
lawyer
solemnly
.
``
God
grant
I
have
*NL*
no
cause
for
it
!
''
And
with
that
he
brought
the
paper
to
his
eyes
*NL*
and
read
as
follows
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
MY
DEAR
UTTERSON
,
--
When
this
shall
fall
into
your
hands
,
I
*NL*
shall
have
disappeared
,
under
what
circumstances
I
have
not
the
*NL*
penetration
to
foresee
,
but
my
instinct
and
all
the
circumstances
*NL*
of
my
nameless
situation
tell
me
that
the
end
is
sure
and
must
be
*NL*
early
.
Go
then
,
and
first
read
the
narrative
which
Lanyon
warned
*NL*
me
he
was
to
place
in
your
hands
;
and
if
you
care
to
hear
more
,
*NL*
turn
to
the
confession
of
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
unworthy
and
unhappy
friend

*NL*
``
HENRY

''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
a
third
enclosure
?
''
asked
Utterson
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
sir
,
''
said
Poole
,
and
gave
into
his
hands
a
considerable
*NL*
packet
sealed
in
several
places
.
*NL*
*NL*
69
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
The
lawyer
put
it
in
his
pocket
.
``
I
would
say
nothing
of
this
*NL*
paper
.
If
your
master
has
fled
or
is
dead
,
we
may
at
least
save
*NL*
his
credit
.
It
is
now
ten

I
must
go
home
and
read
these

documents
in
quiet
;

I
shall
be
back
before
midnight

shall
send

*NL*
*NL*
They
went
out
,
locking
the
door
of
the
theatre
behind
them
;
and
*NL*
Utterson
,
once
more
leaving
the
servants
gathered
about
the
fire
*NL*
in
the
hall
,
trudged
back
to
his
office
to
read
the
two
*NL*
narratives
in
which
this
mystery
was
now
to
be
explained

DR.
LANYON
'S
NARRATIVE
*NL*
*NL*
ON
the
ninth
of
January
,
now
four
days
ago
,
I
received
by
the
*NL*
evening
delivery
a
registered
envelope
,
addressed
in
the
hand
of
*NL*
my
colleague
and
old
school-companion
,
Henry
Jekyll
.
I
was
a
good
*NL*
deal
surprised
by
this
;
for
we
were
by
no
means
in
the
habit
of
*NL*
correspondence
;
I
had
seen
the
man
,
dined
with
him
,
indeed
,
the
*NL*
night
before
;
and
I
could
imagine
nothing
in
our
intercourse
that
*NL*
should
justify
formality
of
registration
.
The
contents
increased
*NL*
my
wonder
;
for
this
is
how
the
letter
ran
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
10th
December

--
*NL*
*NL*
``
DEAR
LANYON
,
You
are
one
of
my
oldest
friends
;
and
although
we
*NL*
may
have
differed
at
times
on
scientific
questions
,
I
can
not
*NL*
remember
,
at
least
on
my
side
,
any
break
in
our
affection
.
There
*NL*
was
never
a
day
when
,
if
you
had
said
to
me
,
`
Jekyll
,
my
life
,
my
*NL*
honour
,
my
reason
,
depend
upon
you

I
would
not
have
sacrificed
*NL*
my
left
hand
to
help
you

Lanyon

my
life

my
honour
my
reason

*NL*
are
all
at
your

*NL*
*NL*
71
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
if
you
fail
me
to-night
I
am
lost
.
You
might
suppose
,
after
this
*NL*
preface
,
that
I
am
going
to
ask
you
for
something
dishonourable
*NL*
to
grant

Judge
for
yourself

*NL*
``
I
want
you
to
postpone
all
other
engagements
for
to-night

*NL*
even
if
you
were
summoned
to
the
bedside
of
an
emperor
;
to
take
a
*NL*
cab
,
unless
your
carriage
should
be
actually
at
the
door
;
and
*NL*
with
this
letter
in
your
hand
for
consultation
,
to
drive
straight
*NL*
to
my
house

Poole
,
my
butler
,
has
his
orders
;
you
will
find
,
him
*NL*
waiting
your
arrival
with
a
locksmith

The
door
of
my
cabinet
is
*NL*
then
to
be
forced

and
you
are
to
go
in
alone

to
open
the
glazed

press

letter
E

on
the
left
hand
,
breaking
the
lock
if
it
be

shut

and
to
draw
out
,
with
all
its
contents
as
they
stand
,
the
*NL*
fourth
drawer
from
the
top
or
-LRB-
which
is
the
same
thing

the
third
*NL*
from
the
bottom
.
In
my
extreme
distress
of
wind
,
I
have
a
morbid
*NL*
fear
of
misdirecting
you
;
but
even
if
I
am
in
error
,
you
may
know
*NL*
the
right
drawer
by
its
contents
:
some
powders
,
a
phial
and
a
*NL*
paper
book
.
This
drawer
I
beg
of
you
to
carry
back
with
you
to
*NL*
Cavendish
Square
exactly
as
it
stands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
the
first
part

you
set
out
at
once
on
the
receipt
of
this

*NL*
long
before
midnight
;
but
I
will
leave
you
that
amount
of
margin
,
*NL*
not
only
in
the
fear
of
one
of
those
obstacles
that
can
neither
*NL*
be
prevented

seen

because
an
hour
when
your
servants
are
in
bed
is
to
be
*NL*
preferred
for
what
will
then
remain
to
do
.
At
midnight
,
then
,
I
*NL*
have
to
ask
you
to
be
alone
in
your
consulting-room
,
to
admit
*NL*
with
your
own

into
the
house
a
man

present
himself

place
in
his
hands
the
drawer
that
you
will
*NL*
have
brought
with
you
from
my
cabinet

Then
you
will
have
played
*NL*
your
part
and
earned
my
gratitude
completely
.
Five
minutes
*NL*
afterwards
,
if
you
insist
upon
an
explanation
,
you
will
have
*NL*
understood
that
these
arrangements
are
of
capital
importance
;
and
*NL*
that
by
the
neglect
of
one
of
them
,
fantastic
as
they
must
*NL*
appear
,
you
might
have
charged
your
conscience
with
my
death
or

the
shipwreck
of
my
reason

*NL*
*NL*
``
Confident
as
I
am
that
you
will
not
trifle
with
this
appeal
,
my

heart
sinks
and
my
hand
trembles
at
the
bare
thought
of
such
a
*NL*
possibility

Think
of
me
at
this
hour
,
in
a
strange
place

*NL*
labouring
under
a
blackness
of
distress
that
no
fancy
can

exaggerate

and
yet
well
aware
that
,
if
you
will
but
punctually
*NL*
serve
me

my
troubles
will
roll
away

to-morrow
morning
.
In
that
case
,
*NL*
dear
Lanyon
,
do
my
errand
when
it
shall
be
most
convenient
for
*NL*
you
in
the
course
of
the
day
;
and
once
more
expect
my
messenger
*NL*
at
midnight
.
It
may
then
already
be
too
late
;
and
if
that
night
*NL*
passes
without
event
,
you
will
know
that
you
have
seen
the
last
*NL*
of
Henry
Jekyll
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
the
reading
of
this
letter
,
I
made
sure
my
colleague
was
*NL*
insane
;
but
till
that
was
proved
beyond
the
possibility
of
doubt
,
*NL*
I
felt
bound
to
do
as
he
requested
.
The
less
I
understood
of
this
*NL*
farrago
,
the
less
I
was
in
a
position
to
judge
of
its
importance
;
*NL*
and
an
appeal
so
worded
could
not
be
set
aside
without
a
grave
*NL*
responsibility
.
I
rose
accordingly
from
table
,
got
into
a
hansom
,
*NL*
and
drove
straight
to
Jekyll
's
house
.
The
butler
was
awaiting
my
*NL*
arrival
;
he
had
received
by
the
same
post
as
mine
a
registered
*NL*
letter
of
instruction
,
and
had
sent
at
once
for
a
locksmith
and
a
*NL*
carpenter
.
The
tradesmen
came
while
we
were
yet
speaking
;
and
we
*NL*
moved
in
a
body
to
old
Dr.
Denman
's
surgical
theatre
,
from
which
*NL*
-LRB-
as
you
are
doubtless
aware
-RRB-
Jekyll
's
private
cabinet
is
most
*NL*
conveniently
entered
.
The
door
was
very
strong
,
the
lock
*NL*
excellent
;
the
carpenter
avowed
he
would
have
great
trouble
and
*NL*
have
to
do
much
damage
,
if
force
were
to
be
used
;
and
the
*NL*
locksmith
was
near
despair
.
But
this
last
was
a
handy
fellow
,
*NL*
*NL*
74
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
and
after
two
hours
'
work
,
the
door
stood
open
.
The
press
marked
*NL*
E
was
unlocked
;
and
I
took
out
the
drawer
,
had
it
filled
up
with
*NL*
straw
and
tied
in
a
sheet
,
and
returned
with
it
to
Cavendish
*NL*
Square
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
I
proceeded
to
examine
its
contents
.
The
powders
were
neatly
*NL*
enough
made
up
,
but
not
with
the
nicety
of
the
dispensing
*NL*
chemist
;
so
that
it
was
plain
they
were
of
Jekyll
's
private
*NL*
manufacture
;
and
when
I
opened
one
of
the
wrappers
I
found
what
*NL*
seemed
to
me
a
simple
crystalline
salt
of
a
white
colour
.
The
*NL*
phial
,
to
which
I
next
turned
my
attention
,
might
have
been
about
*NL*
half-full
of
a
blood-red
liquor
,
which
was
highly
pungent
to
the
*NL*
sense
of
smell
and
seemed
to
me
to
contain
phosphorus
and
some
*NL*
volatile
ether
.
At
the
other
ingredients
I
could
make
no
guess
.
*NL*
The
book
was
an
ordinary
version-book
and
contained
little
but
a
*NL*
series
of
dates
.
These
covered
a
period
of
many
years
,
but
I
*NL*
observed
that
the
entries
ceased
nearly
a
year
ago
and
quite
*NL*
abruptly
.
Here
and
there
a
brief
remark
was
appended
to
a
date
,
*NL*
usually
no
more
than
a
single
word
:
``
double
''
occurring
perhaps
*NL*
six
times
in
a
total
of
several
hundred
entries
;
and
once
very
*NL*
early
in
the
list
and
followed
by
several
marks
of
exclamation
,
*NL*
``
total
failure
!!!
''
All
this
,
though
it
whetted
my
curiosity
,
told
*NL*
me
little
that
was
definite
.
Here
were
a
phial
of
some
tincture
,
*NL*
a
paper
of
some
salt
,
and
the
record
of
a
series
of
experi
-
*NL*
*NL*
75
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
ments
that
had
led
-LRB-
like
too
many
of
Jekyll
's
investigations
-RRB-
to
*NL*
no
end
of
practical
usefulness
.
How
could
the
presence
of
these
*NL*
articles
in
my
house
affect
either
the
honour
,
the
sanity
,
or
the
*NL*
life
of
my
flighty
colleague
?
If
his
messenger
could
go
to
one
*NL*
place
,
why
could
he
not
go
to
another
?
And
even
granting
some
*NL*
impediment
,
why
was
this
gentleman
to
be
received
by
me
in
*NL*
secret
?
The
more
I
reflected
the
more
convinced
I
grew
that
I
was
*NL*
dealing
with
a
case
of
cerebral
disease
:
and
though
I
dismissed
*NL*
my
servants
to
bed
,
I
loaded
an
old
revolver
,
that
I
might
be
*NL*
found
in
some
posture
of
self-defence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Twelve
o'clock
had
scarce
rung
out
over
London
,
ere
the
knocker
*NL*
sounded
very
gently
on
the
door
.
I
went
myself
at
the
summons
,
*NL*
and
found
a
small
man
crouching
against
the
pillars
of
the
*NL*
portico
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
come
from
Dr.
Jekyll
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
told
me
``
yes
''
by
a
constrained
gesture
;
and
when
I
had
bidden
*NL*
him
enter
,
he
did
not
obey
me
without
a
searching
backward
glance
*NL*
into
the
darkness
of
the
square
.
There
was
a
policeman
not
far
*NL*
off
,
advancing
with
his
bull
's
eye
open
;
and
at
the
sight
,
I
*NL*
thought
my
visitor
started
and
made
greater
haste
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
particulars
struck
me
,
I
confess
,
disagreeably
;
and
as
I
*NL*
followed
him
into
the
bright
light
of
the
consulting-room
,
I
kept
*NL*
my
hand
ready
on
my
weapon
.
Here
,
at
last
,
I
had
a
*NL*
*NL*
76
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
chance
of
clearly
seeing
him
.
I
had
never
set
eyes
on
him
before
,
*NL*
so
much
was
certain
.
He
was
small
,
as
I
have
said
;
I
was
struck
*NL*
besides
with
the
shocking
expression
of
his
face
,
with
his
*NL*
remarkable
combination
of
great
muscular
activity
and
great
*NL*
apparent
debility
of
constitution
,
and
--
last
but
not
least
--
*NL*
with
the
odd
,
subjective
disturbance
caused
by
his
neighbourhood
.
*NL*
This
bore
some
resemblance
to
incipient
rigour
,
and
was
*NL*
accompanied
by
a
marked
sinking
of
the
pulse
.
At
the
time
,
I
set
*NL*
it
down
to
some
idiosyncratic
,
personal
distaste
,
and
merely
*NL*
wondered
at
the
acuteness
of
the
symptoms
;
but
I
have
since
had
*NL*
reason
to
believe
the
cause
to
lie
much
deeper
in
the
nature
of
*NL*
man
,
and
to
turn
on
some
nobler
hinge
than
the
principle
of
*NL*
hatred
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
person
-LRB-
who
had
thus
,
from
the
first
moment
of
his
entrance
,
*NL*
struck
in
me
what
I
can
only
describe
as
a
disgustful
curiosity
-RRB-
*NL*
was
dressed
in
a
fashion
that
would
have
made
an
ordinary
person
*NL*
laughable
;
his
clothes
,
that
is
to
say
,
although
they
were
of
*NL*
rich
and
sober
fabric
,
were
enormously
too
large
for
him
in
every
*NL*
measurement
--
the
trousers
hanging
on
his
legs
and
rolled
up
to
*NL*
keep
them
from
the
ground
,
the
waist
of
the
coat
below
his
*NL*
haunches
,
and
the
collar
sprawling
wide
upon
his
shoulders
.
*NL*
Strange
to
relate
,
this
ludicrous
accoutrement
was
far
from
*NL*
moving
me
to
laughter
.
Rather
,
as
there
was
something
abnormal
*NL*
and
misbe
-
*NL*
*NL*
77
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
gotten
in
the
very
essence
of
the
creature
that
now
faced
me
--
*NL*
something
seizing
,
surprising
,
and
revolting
--
this
fresh
*NL*
disparity
seemed
but
to
fit
in
with
and
to
reinforce
it
;
so
that
*NL*
to
my
interest
in
the
man
's
nature
and
character
,
there
was
added
*NL*
a
curiosity
as
to
his
origin
,
his
life
,
his
fortune
and
status
in
*NL*
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
observations
,
though
they
have
taken
so
great
a
space
to
be
*NL*
set
down
in
,
were
yet
the
work
of
a
few
seconds
.
My
visitor
was
,
*NL*
indeed
,
on
fire
with
sombre
excitement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
got
it
?
''
he
cried
.
``
Have
you
got
it
?
''
And
so
lively
was
*NL*
his
impatience
that
he
even
laid
his
hand
upon
my
arm
and
sought
*NL*
to
shake
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
put
him
back
,
conscious
at
his
touch
of
a
certain
icy
pang
*NL*
along
my
blood
.
``
Come
,
sir
,
''
said
I.
``
You
forget
that
I
have
not
*NL*
yet
the
pleasure
of
your
acquaintance
.
Be
seated
,
if
you
please
.
''
*NL*
And
I
showed
him
an
example
,
and
sat
down
myself
in
my
customary
*NL*
seat
and
with
as
fair
an
imitation
of
my
ordinary
manner
to
a
*NL*
patient
,
as
the
lateness
of
the
hour
,
the
nature
of
my
*NL*
pre-occupations
,
and
the
horror
I
had
of
my
visitor
,
would
suffer
*NL*
me
to
muster
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Dr.
Lanyon
,
''
he
replied
civilly
enough
.
``
What
*NL*
you
say
is
very
well
founded
;
and
my
impatience
has
shown
its
*NL*
heels
to
my
politeness
.
I
come
here
at
the
instance
of
your
*NL*
colleague
,
Dr.
Henry
Jekyll
,
on
a
piece
of
business
of
some
*NL*
moment
;
and
I
under
-
*NL*
*NL*
78
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
stood
...
''
He
paused
and
put
his
hand
to
his
throat
,
and
I
could
*NL*
see
,
in
spite
of
his
collected
manner
,
that
he
was
wrestling
*NL*
against
the
approaches
of
the
hysteria
--
``
I
understood
,
a
*NL*
drawer
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
here
I
took
pity
on
my
visitor
's
suspense
,
and
some
perhaps
*NL*
on
my
own
growing
curiosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
it
is
,
sir
,
''
said
I
,
pointing
to
the
drawer
,
where
it
lay
*NL*
on
the
floor
behind
a
table
and
still
covered
with
the
sheet
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sprang
to
it
,
and
then
paused
,
and
laid
his
hand
upon
his
*NL*
heart
:
I
could
hear
his
teeth
grate
with
the
convulsive
action
of
*NL*
his
jaws
;
and
his
face
was
so
ghastly
to
see
that
I
grew
alarmed
*NL*
both
for
his
life
and
reason
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Compose
yourself
,
''
said
I
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
a
dreadful
smile
to
me
,
and
as
if
with
the
decision
of
*NL*
despair
,
plucked
away
the
sheet
.
At
sight
of
the
contents
,
he
*NL*
uttered
one
loud
sob
of
such
immense
relief
that
I
sat
petrified
.
*NL*
And
the
next
moment
,
in
a
voice
that
was
already
fairly
well
*NL*
under
control
,
``
Have
you
a
graduated
glass
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
rose
from
my
place
with
something
of
an
effort
and
gave
him
*NL*
what
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
thanked
me
with
a
smiling
nod
,
measured
out
a
few
minims
of
*NL*
the
red
tincture
and
added
one
of
the
powders
.
The
mixture
,
which
*NL*
was
at
first
of
a
reddish
hue
,
began
,
in
proportion
as
the
*NL*
crystals
melted
,
to
brighten
in
colour
,
to
effervesce
audibly
,
*NL*
and
to
throw
off
small
*NL*
*NL*
79
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
fumes
of
vapour
.
Suddenly
and
at
the
same
moment
,
the
ebullition
*NL*
ceased
and
the
compound
changed
to
a
dark
purple
,
which
faded
*NL*
again
more
slowly
to
a
watery
green
.
My
visitor
,
who
had
watched
*NL*
these
metamorphoses
with
a
keen
eye
,
smiled
,
set
down
the
glass
*NL*
upon
the
table
,
and
then
turned
and
looked
upon
me
with
an
air
of
*NL*
scrutiny
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
''
said
he
,
``
to
settle
what
remains
.
Will
you
be
wise
?
*NL*
will
you
be
guided
?
will
you
suffer
me
to
take
this
glass
in
my
*NL*
hand
and
to
go
forth
from
your
house
without
further
parley
?
or
*NL*
has
the
greed
of
curiosity
too
much
command
of
you
?
Think
before
*NL*
you
answer
,
for
it
shall
be
done
as
you
decide
.
As
you
decide
,
*NL*
you
shall
be
left
as
you
were
before
,
and
neither
richer
nor
*NL*
wiser
,
unless
the
sense
of
service
rendered
to
a
man
in
mortal
*NL*
distress
may
be
counted
as
a
kind
of
riches
of
the
soul
.
Or
,
if
*NL*
you
shall
so
prefer
to
choose
,
a
new
province
of
knowledge
and
*NL*
new
avenues
to
fame
and
power
shall
be
laid
open
to
you
,
here
,
in
*NL*
this
room
,
upon
the
instant
;
and
your
sight
shall
be
blasted
by
a
*NL*
prodigy
to
stagger
the
unbelief
of
Satan
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
said
I
,
affecting
a
coolness
that
I
was
far
from
truly
*NL*
possessing
,
``
you
speak
enigmas
,
and
you
will
perhaps
not
wonder
*NL*
that
I
hear
you
with
no
very
strong
impression
of
belief
.
But
I
*NL*
have
gone
too
far
in
the
way
of
inexplicable
services
to
pause
*NL*
before
I
see
the
end
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
well
,
''
replied
my
visitor
.
``
Lanyon
,
*NL*
*NL*
80
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
you
remember
your
vows
:
what
follows
is
under
the
seal
of
our
*NL*
profession
.
And
now
,
you
who
have
so
long
been
bound
to
the
most
*NL*
narrow
and
material
views
,
you
who
have
denied
the
virtue
of
*NL*
transcendental
medicine
,
you
who
have
derided
your
superiors

*NL*
behold
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
put
the
glass
to
his
lips
and
drank
at
one
gulp
.
A
cry
*NL*
followed
;
he
reeled
,
staggered
,
clutched
at
the
table
and
held
*NL*
on
,
staring
with
injected
eyes
,
gasping
with
open
mouth
;
and
as
I
*NL*
looked
there
came
,
I
thought
,
a
change
--
he
seemed
to
swell
--
*NL*
his
face
became
suddenly
black
and
the
features
seemed
to
melt
*NL*
and
alter
--
and
the
next
moment
,
I
had
sprung
to
my
feet
and
*NL*
leaped
back
against
the
wall
,
my
arm
raised
to
shield
me
from
*NL*
that
prodigy
,
my
mind
submerged
in
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
God
!
''
I
screamed
,
and
``
O
God
!
''
again
and
again
;
for
there
*NL*
before
my
eyes
--
pale
and
shaken
,
and
half-fainting
,
and
groping
*NL*
before
him
with
his
hands
,
like
a
man
restored
from
death
--
*NL*
there
stood
Henry
Jekyll
!
*NL*
*NL*
What
he
told
me
in
the
next
hour
,
I
can
not
bring
my
mind
to
set
*NL*
on
paper
.
I
saw
what
I
saw
,
I
heard
what
I
heard
,
and
my
soul
*NL*
sickened
at
it
;
and
yet
now
when
that
sight
has
faded
from
my
*NL*
eyes
,
I
ask
myself
if
I
believe
it
,
and
I
can
not
answer
.
My
life
*NL*
is
shaken
to
its
roots
;
sleep
has
left
me
;
the
deadliest
terror
*NL*
sits
by
me
at
all
hours
of
the
day
and
night
;
I
feel
that
my
days
*NL*
are
numbered
,
and
that
I
*NL*
*NL*
81
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
must
die
;
and
yet
I
shall
die
incredulous
.
As
for
the
moral
*NL*
turpitude
that
man
unveiled
to
me
,
even
with
tears
of
penitence
,
*NL*
I
can
not
,
even
in
memory
,
dwell
on
it
without
a
start
of
horror
.
*NL*
I
will
say
but
one
thing
,
Utterson
,
and
that
-LRB-
if
you
can
bring
*NL*
your
mind
to
credit
it
-RRB-
will
be
more
than
enough
.
The
creature

who
crept
into
my

night

on
Jekyll

known
by
the

Hyde
and
hunted
for
in
every

corner
of
the

as
the
murderer
of
Carew

HENRY
JEKYLL
'S
FULL
STATEMENT
OF
THE
CASE
*NL*
*NL*
I
WAS
born
in
the
year
18
--
to
a
large
fortune
,
endowed
besides
*NL*
with
excellent
parts
,
inclined
by
nature
to
industry
,
fond
of
the
*NL*
respect
of
the
wise
and
good
among
my
fellow-men
,
and
thus
,
as
*NL*
might
have
been
supposed
,
with
every
guarantee
of
an
honourable
*NL*
and
distinguished
future
.
And
indeed
the
worst
of
my
faults
was
a
*NL*
certain
impatient
gaiety
of
disposition
,
such
as
has
made
the
*NL*
happiness
of
many
,
but
such
as
I
found
it
hard
to
reconcile
with
*NL*
my
imperious
desire
to
carry
my
head
high
,
and
wear
a
more
than
*NL*
commonly
grave
countenance
before
the
public
.
Hence
it
came
about
*NL*
that
I
concealed
my
pleasures
;
and
that
when
I
reached
years
of
*NL*
reflection
,
and
began
to
look
round
me
and
take
stock
of
my
*NL*
progress
and
position
in
the
world
,
I
stood
already
committed
to
*NL*
a
profound
duplicity
of
life
.
Many
a
man
would
have
even
blazoned
*NL*
such
irregularities
as
I
was
guilty
of
;
but
from
the
high
views
*NL*
that
I
had
set
before
me
,
I
regarded
and
hid
them
with
an
almost
*NL*
morbid
sense
of
shame
.
It
was
thus
rather
the
exacting
*NL*
*NL*
83
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
nature
of
my
aspirations
than
any
particular
degradation
in
my
*NL*
faults
,
that
made
me
what
I
was
and
,
with
even
a
deeper
trench
*NL*
than
in
the
majority
of
men
,
severed
in
me
those
provinces
of
*NL*
good
and
ill
which
divide
and
compound
man
's
dual
nature
.
In
this
*NL*
case
,
I
was
driven
to
reflect
deeply
and
inveterately
on
that
*NL*
hard
law
of
life
,
which
lies
at
the
root
of
religion
and
is
one
*NL*
of
the
most
plentiful
springs
of
distress
.
Though
so
profound
a
*NL*
double-dealer
,
I
was
in
no
sense
a
hypocrite
;
both
sides
of
me
*NL*
were
in
dead
earnest
;
I
was
no
more
myself
when
I
laid
aside
*NL*
restraint
and
plunged
in
shame
,
than
when
I
laboured
,
in
the
eye
*NL*
of
day
,
at
the
furtherance
of
knowledge
or
the
relief
of
sorrow
*NL*
and
suffering
.
And
it
chanced
that
the
direction
of
my
scientific
*NL*
studies
,
which
led
wholly
toward
the
mystic
and
the
*NL*
transcendental
,
re-acted
and
shed
a
strong
light
on
this
*NL*
consciousness
of
the
perennial
war
among
my
members
.
With
every
*NL*
day
,
and
from
both
sides
of
my
intelligence
,
the
moral
and
the
*NL*
intellectual
,
I
thus
drew
steadily
nearer
to
that
truth
,
by
whose
*NL*
partial
discovery
I
have
been
doomed
to
such
a
dreadful
*NL*
shipwreck
:
that
man
is
not
truly
one
,
but
truly
two
.
I
say
two
,
*NL*
because
the
state
of
my
own
knowledge
does
not
pass
beyond
that
*NL*
point
.
Others
will
follow
,
others
will
outstrip
me
on
the
same
*NL*
lines
;
and
I
hazard
the
guess
that
man
will
be
ultimately
known
*NL*
for
a
mere
polity
of
multifarious
,
incongruous
,
and
independent
*NL*
denizens
.
I
,
for
my
*NL*
*NL*
84
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
part
,
from
the
nature
of
my
life
,
advanced
infallibly
in
one
*NL*
direction
and
in
one
direction
only
.
It
was
on
the
moral
side
,
*NL*
and
in
my
own
person
,
that
I
learned
to
recognise
the
thorough
*NL*
and
primitive
duality
of
man
;
I
saw
that
,
of
the
two
natures
that
*NL*
contended
in
the
field
of
my
consciousness
,
even
if
I
could
*NL*
rightly
be
said
to
be
either
,
it
was
only
because
I
was
radically
*NL*
both
;
and
from
an
early
date
,
even
before
the
course
of
my
*NL*
scientific
discoveries
had
begun
to
suggest
the
most
naked
*NL*
possibility
of
such
a
miracle
,
I
had
learned
to
dwell
with
*NL*
pleasure
,
as
a
beloved
day-dream
,
on
the
thought
of
the
*NL*
separation
of
these
elements
.
If
each
,
I
told
myself
,
could
but
*NL*
be
housed
in
separate
identities
,
life
would
be
relieved
of
all
*NL*
that
was
unbearable
;
the
unjust
delivered
from
the
aspirations
*NL*
might
go
his
way
,
and
remorse
of
his
more
upright
twin
;
and
the
*NL*
just
could
walk
steadfastly
and
securely
on
his
upward
path
,
*NL*
doing
the
good
things
in
which
he
found
his
pleasure
,
and
no
*NL*
longer
exposed
to
disgrace
and
penitence
by
the
hands
of
this
*NL*
extraneous
evil
.
It
was
the
curse
of
mankind
that
these
*NL*
incongruous
fagots
were
thus
bound
together
that
in
the
agonised
*NL*
womb
of
consciousness
,
these
polar
twins
should
be
continuously
*NL*
struggling
.
How
,
then
,
were
they
dissociated
?
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
so
far
in
my
reflections
when
,
as
I
have
said
,
a
side-light
*NL*
began
to
shine
upon
the
subject
from
the
laboratory
table
.
I
*NL*
began
to
perceive
*NL*
*NL*
85
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
more
deeply
than
it
has
ever
yet
been
stated
,
the
trembling
*NL*
immateriality
,
the
mist-like
transience
of
this
seemingly
so
*NL*
solid
body
in
which
we
walk
attired
.
Certain
agents
I
found
to
*NL*
have
the
power
to
shake
and
to
pluck
back
that
fleshly
vestment
,
*NL*
even
as
a
wind
might
toss
the
curtains
of
a
pavilion
.
For
two
*NL*
good
reasons
,
I
will
not
enter
deeply
into
this
scientific
branch
*NL*
of
my
confession
.
First
,
because
I
have
been
made
to
learn
that
*NL*
the
doom
and
burthen
of
our
life
is
bound
for
ever
on
man
's
*NL*
shoulders
,
and
when
the
attempt
is
made
to
cast
it
off
,
it
but
*NL*
returns
upon
us
with
more
unfamiliar
and
more
awful
pressure
.
*NL*
Second
,
because
,
as
my
narrative
will
make
,
alas
!
too
evident
,
my
*NL*
discoveries
were
incomplete
.
Enough
,
then
,
that
I
not
only
*NL*
recognised
my
natural
body
for
the
mere
aura
and
effulgence
of
*NL*
certain
of
the
powers
that
made
up
my
spirit
,
but
managed
to
*NL*
compound
a
drug
by
which
these
powers
should
be
dethroned
from
*NL*
their
supremacy
,
and
a
second
form
and
countenance
substituted
,
*NL*
none
the
less
natural
to
me
because
they
were
the
expression
,
and
*NL*
bore
the
stamp
,
of
lower
elements
in
my
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
hesitated
long
before
I
put
this
theory
to
the
test
of
*NL*
practice
.
I
knew
well
that
I
risked
death
;
for
any
drug
that
so
*NL*
potently
controlled
and
shook
the
very
fortress
of
identity
,
*NL*
might
by
the
least
scruple
of
an
overdose
or
at
the
least
*NL*
inopportunity
in
the
moment
of
exhibition
,
utterly
blot
out
that
*NL*
immaterial
tabernacle
which
I
*NL*
*NL*
86
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
looked
to
it
to
change
.
But
the
temptation
of
a
discovery
so
*NL*
singular
and
profound
,
at
last
overcame
the
suggestions
of
alarm
.
*NL*
I
had
long
since
prepared
my
tincture
;
I
purchased
at
once
,
from
*NL*
a
firm
of
wholesale
chemists
,
a
large
quantity
of
a
particular
*NL*
salt
which
I
knew
,
from
my
experiments
,
to
be
the
last
ingredient
*NL*
required
;
and
late
one
accursed
night
,
I
compounded
the
elements
,
*NL*
watched
them
boil
and
smoke
together
in
the
glass
,
and
when
the
*NL*
ebullition
had
subsided
,
with
a
strong
glow
of
courage
,
drank
off
*NL*
the
potion
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
most
racking
pangs
succeeded
:
a
grinding
in
the
bones
,
deadly
*NL*
nausea
,
and
a
horror
of
the
spirit
that
can
not
be
exceeded
at
the
*NL*
hour
of
birth
or
death
.
Then
these
agonies
began
swiftly
to
*NL*
subside
,
and
I
came
to
myself
as
if
out
of
a
great
sickness
.
*NL*
There
was
something
strange
in
my
sensations
,
something
*NL*
indescribably
new
and
,
from
its
very
novelty
,
incredibly
sweet
.
I
*NL*
felt
younger
,
lighter
,
happier
in
body
;
within
I
was
conscious
of
*NL*
a
heady
recklessness
,
a
current
of
disordered
sensual
images
*NL*
running
like
a
mill-race
in
my
fancy
,
a
solution
of
the
bonds
of
*NL*
obligation
,
an
unknown
but
not
an
innocent
freedom
of
the
soul
.
I
*NL*
knew
myself
,
at
the
first
breath
of
this
new
life
,
to
be
more
*NL*
wicked
,
tenfold
more
wicked
,
sold
a
slave
to
my
original
evil
;
*NL*
and
the
thought
,
in
that
moment
,
braced
and
delighted
me
like
*NL*
wine
.
I
stretched
out
my
hands
,
exulting
in
the
freshness
of
*NL*
these
*NL*
*NL*
87
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
sensations
;
and
in
the
act
,
I
was
suddenly
aware
that
I
had
lost
*NL*
in
stature
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
mirror
,
at
that
date
,
in
my
room
;
that
which
stands
*NL*
beside
me
as
I
write
,
was
brought
there
later
on
and
for
the
very
*NL*
purpose
of
these
transformations
.
The
night
,
however
,
was
far
*NL*
gone
into
the
morning
--
the
morning
,
black
as
it
was
,
was
nearly
*NL*
ripe
for
the
conception
of
the
day
--
the
inmates
of
my
house
*NL*
were
locked
in
the
most
rigorous
hours
of
slumber
;
and
I
*NL*
determined
,
flushed
as
I
was
with
hope
and
triumph
,
to
venture
in
*NL*
my
new
shape
as
far
as
to
my
bedroom
.
I
crossed
the
yard
,
wherein
*NL*
the
constellations
looked
down
upon
me
,
I
could
have
thought
,
*NL*
with
wonder
,
the
first
creature
of
that
sort
that
their
*NL*
unsleeping
vigilance
had
yet
disclosed
to
them
;
I
stole
through
*NL*
the
corridors
,
a
stranger
in
my
own
house
;
and
coming
to
my
room
,
*NL*
I
saw
for
the
first
time
the
appearance
of
Edward
Hyde
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
must
here
speak
by
theory
alone
,
saying
not
that
which
I
know
,
*NL*
but
that
which
I
suppose
to
be
most
probable
.
The
evil
side
of
my
*NL*
nature
,
to
which
I
had
now
transferred
the
stamping
efficacy
,
was
*NL*
less
robust
and
less
developed
than
the
good
which
I
had
just
*NL*
deposed
.
Again
,
in
the
course
of
my
life
,
which
had
been
,
after
*NL*
all
,
nine-tenths
a
life
of
effort
,
virtue
,
and
control
,
it
had
*NL*
been
much
less
exercised
and
much
less
exhausted
.
And
hence
,
as
I
*NL*
think
,
it
came
about
that
Edward
Hyde
was
so
much
smaller
,
*NL*
*NL*
88
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
slighter
,
and
younger
than
Henry
Jekyll
.
Even
as
good
shone
upon
*NL*
the
countenance
of
the
one
,
evil
was
written
broadly
and
plainly
*NL*
on
the
face
of
the
other
.
Evil
besides
-LRB-
which
I
must
still
*NL*
believe
to
be
the
lethal
side
of
man
-RRB-
had
left
on
that
body
an
*NL*
imprint
of
deformity
and
decay
.
And
yet
when
I
looked
upon
that
*NL*
ugly
idol
in
the
glass
,
I
was
conscious
of
no
repugnance
,
rather
*NL*
of
a
leap
of
welcome
.
This
,
too
,
was
myself
.
It
seemed
natural
*NL*
and
human
.
In
my
eyes
it
bore
a
livelier
image
of
the
spirit
,
it
*NL*
seemed
more
express
and
single
,
than
the
imperfect
and
divided
*NL*
countenance
I
had
been
hitherto
accustomed
to
call
mine
.
And
in
*NL*
so
far
I
was
doubtless
right
.
I
have
observed
that
when
I
wore
*NL*
the
semblance
of
Edward
Hyde
,
none
could
come
near
to
me
at
first
*NL*
without
a
visible
misgiving
of
the
flesh
.
This
,
as
I
take
it
,
was
*NL*
because
all
human
beings
,
as
we
meet
them
,
are
commingled
out
of
*NL*
good
and
evil
:
and
Edward
Hyde
,
alone
in
the
ranks
of
mankind
,
*NL*
was
pure
evil
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
lingered
but
a
moment
at
the
mirror
:
the
second
and
conclusive
*NL*
experiment
had
yet
to
be
attempted
;
it
yet
remained
to
be
seen
if
*NL*
I
had
lost
my
identity
beyond
redemption
and
must
flee
before
*NL*
daylight
from
a
house
that
was
no
longer
mine
;
and
hurrying
back
*NL*
to
my
cabinet
,
I
once
more
prepared
and
drank
the
cup
,
once
more
*NL*
suffered
the
pangs
of
dissolution
,
and
came
to
myself
once
more
*NL*
with
the
character
,
the
stature
,
and
the
face
of
Henry
Jekyll
.
*NL*
*NL*
89
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
That
night
I
had
come
to
the
fatal
cross-roads
.
Had
I
approached
*NL*
my
discovery
in
a
more
noble
spirit
,
had
I
risked
the
experiment
*NL*
while
under
the
empire
of
generous
or
pious
aspirations
,
all
must
*NL*
have
been
otherwise
,
and
from
these
agonies
of
death
and
birth
,
I
*NL*
had
come
forth
an
angel
instead
of
a
fiend
.
The
drug
had
no
*NL*
discriminating
action
;
it
was
neither
diabolical
nor
divine
;
it
*NL*
but
shook
the
doors
of
the
prison-house
of
my
disposition
;
and
*NL*
like
the
captives
of
Philippi
,
that
which
stood
within
ran
forth
.
*NL*
At
that
time
my
virtue
slumbered
;
my
evil
,
kept
awake
by
*NL*
ambition
,
was
alert
and
swift
to
seize
the
occasion
;
and
the
*NL*
thing
that
was
projected
was
Edward
Hyde
.
Hence
,
although
I
had
*NL*
now
two
characters
as
well
as
two
appearances
,
one
was
wholly
*NL*
evil
,
and
the
other
was
still
the
old
Henry
Jekyll
,
that
*NL*
incongruous
compound
of
whose
reformation
and
improvement
I
had
*NL*
already
learned
to
despair
.
The
movement
was
thus
wholly
toward
*NL*
the
worse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
at
that
time
,
I
had
not
yet
conquered
my
aversion
to
the
*NL*
dryness
of
a
life
of
study
.
I
would
still
be
merrily
disposed
at
*NL*
times
;
and
as
my
pleasures
were
-LRB-
to
say
the
least
-RRB-
undignified
,
*NL*
and
I
was
not
only
well
known
and
highly
considered
,
but
growing
*NL*
toward
the
elderly
man
,
this
incoherency
of
my
life
was
daily
*NL*
growing
more
unwelcome
.
It
was
on
this
side
that
my
new
power
*NL*
tempted
me
until
I
fell
in
slavery
.
I
had
but
to
drink
the
cup
,
*NL*
to
doff
at
once
the
body
*NL*
*NL*
90
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
of
the
noted
professor
,
and
to
assume
,
like
a
thick
cloak
,
that
*NL*
of
Edward
Hyde
.
I
smiled
at
the
notion
;
it
seemed
to
me
at
the
*NL*
time
to
be
humorous
;
and
I
made
my
preparations
with
the
most
*NL*
studious
care
.
I
took
and
furnished
that
house
in
Soho
,
to
which
*NL*
Hyde
was
tracked
by
the
police
;
and
engaged
as
housekeeper
a
*NL*
creature
whom
I
well
knew
to
be
silent
and
unscrupulous
.
On
the
*NL*
other
side
,
I
announced
to
my
servants
that
a
Mr.
Hyde
-LRB-
whom
I
*NL*
described
-RRB-
was
to
have
full
liberty
and
power
about
my
house
in
*NL*
the
square
;
and
to
parry
mishaps
,
I
even
called
and
made
myself
a
*NL*
familiar
object
,
in
my
second
character
.
I
next
drew
up
that
will
*NL*
to
which
you
so
much
objected
;
so
that
if
anything
befell
me
in
*NL*
the
person
of
Dr.
Jekyll
,
I
could
enter
on
that
of
Edward
Hyde
*NL*
without
pecuniary
loss
.
And
thus
fortified
,
as
I
supposed
,
on
*NL*
every
side
,
I
began
to
profit
by
the
strange
immunities
of
my
*NL*
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
Men
have
before
hired
bravos
to
transact
their
crimes
,
while
*NL*
their
own
person
and
reputation
sat
under
shelter
.
I
was
the
*NL*
first
that
ever
did
so
for
his
pleasures
.
I
was
the
first
that
*NL*
could
thus
plod
in
the
public
eye
with
a
load
of
genial
*NL*
respectability
,
and
in
a
moment
,
like
a
schoolboy
,
strip
off
*NL*
these
lendings
and
spring
headlong
into
the
sea
of
liberty
.
But
*NL*
for
me
,
in
my
impenetrable
mantle
,
the
safety
was
complete
.
Think
*NL*
of
it
--
I
did
not
even
exist
!
Let
me
but
escape
into
my
*NL*
laboratory
door
,
give
me
but
a
second
or
*NL*
*NL*
91
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
two
to
mix
and
swallow
the
draught
that
I
had
always
standing
*NL*
ready
;
and
whatever
he
had
done
,
Edward
Hyde
would
pass
away
like
*NL*
the
stain
of
breath
upon
a
mirror
;
and
there
in
his
stead
,
*NL*
quietly
at
home
,
trimming
the
midnight
lamp
in
his
study
,
a
man
*NL*
who
could
afford
to
laugh
at
suspicion
,
would
be
Henry
Jekyll
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
pleasures
which
I
made
haste
to
seek
in
my
disguise
were
,
as
*NL*
I
have
said
,
undignified
;
I
would
scarce
use
a
harder
term
.
But
*NL*
in
the
hands
of
Edward
Hyde
,
they
soon
began
to
turn
toward
the
*NL*
monstrous
.
When
I
would
come
back
from
these
excursions
,
I
was
*NL*
often
plunged
into
a
kind
of
wonder
at
my
vicarious
depravity
.
*NL*
This
familiar
that
I
called
out
of
my
own
soul
,
and
sent
forth
*NL*
alone
to
do
his
good
pleasure
,
was
a
being
inherently
malign
and
*NL*
villainous
;
his
every
act
and
thought
centred
on
self
;
drinking
*NL*
pleasure
with
bestial
avidity
from
any
degree
of
torture
to
*NL*
another
;
relentless
like
a
man
of
stone
.
Henry
Jekyll
stood
at
*NL*
times
aghast
before
the
acts
of
Edward
Hyde
;
but
the
situation
*NL*
was
apart
from
ordinary
laws
,
and
insidiously
relaxed
the
grasp
*NL*
of
conscience
.
It
was
Hyde
,
after
all
,
and
Hyde
alone
,
that
was
*NL*
guilty
.
Jekyll
was
no
worse
;
he
woke
again
to
his
good
qualities
*NL*
seemingly
unimpaired
;
he
would
even
make
haste
,
where
it
was
*NL*
possible
,
to
undo
the
evil
done
by
Hyde
.
And
thus
his
conscience
*NL*
slumbered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Into
the
details
of
the
infamy
at
which
I
thus
*NL*
*NL*
92
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
connived
-LRB-
for
even
now
I
can
scarce
grant
that
I
committed
it
-RRB-
I
*NL*
have
no
design
of
entering
;
I
mean
but
to
point
out
the
warnings
*NL*
and
the
successive
steps
with
which
my
chastisement
approached
.
I
*NL*
met
with
one
accident
which
,
as
it
brought
on
no
consequence
,
I
*NL*
shall
no
more
than
mention
.
An
act
of
cruelty
to
a
child
aroused
*NL*
against
me
the
anger
of
a
passer-by
,
whom
I
recognised
the
other
*NL*
day
in
the
person
of
your
kinsman
;
the
doctor
and
the
child
's
*NL*
family
joined
him
;
there
were
moments
when
I
feared
for
my
life
;
*NL*
and
at
last
,
in
order
to
pacify
their
too
just
resentment
,
Edward
*NL*
Hyde
had
to
bring
them
to
the
door
,
and
pay
them
in
a
cheque
*NL*
drawn
in
the
name
of
Henry
Jekyll
.
But
this
danger
was
easily
*NL*
eliminated
from
the
future
,
by
opening
an
account
at
another
bank
*NL*
in
the
name
of
Edward
Hyde
himself
;
and
when
,
by
sloping
my
own
*NL*
hand
backward
,
I
had
supplied
my
double
with
a
signature
,
I
*NL*
thought
I
sat
beyond
the
reach
of
fate
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
two
months
before
the
murder
of
Sir
Danvers
,
I
had
been
out
*NL*
for
one
of
my
adventures
,
had
returned
at
a
late
hour
,
and
woke
*NL*
the
next
day
in
bed
with
somewhat
odd
sensations
.
It
was
in
vain
*NL*
I
looked
about
me
;
in
vain
I
saw
the
decent
furniture
and
tall
*NL*
proportions
of
my
room
in
the
square
;
in
vain
that
I
recognised
*NL*
the
pattern
of
the
bed-curtains
and
the
design
of
the
mahogany
*NL*
frame
;
something
still
kept
insisting
that
I
was
not
where
I
was
,
*NL*
*NL*
93
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
that
I
had
not
wakened
where
I
seemed
to
be
,
but
in
the
little
*NL*
room
in
Soho
where
I
was
accustomed
to
sleep
in
the
body
of
*NL*
Edward
Hyde
.
I
smiled
to
myself
,
and
,
in
my
psychological
way
*NL*
began
lazily
to
inquire
into
the
elements
of
this
illusion
,
*NL*
occasionally
,
even
as
I
did
so
,
dropping
back
into
a
comfortable
*NL*
morning
doze
.
I
was
still
so
engaged
when
,
in
one
of
my
more
*NL*
wakeful
moments
,
my
eyes
fell
upon
my
hand
.
Now
the
hand
of
Henry
*NL*
Jekyll
-LRB-
as
you
have
often
remarked
-RRB-
was
professional
in
shape
and
*NL*
size
:
it
was
large
,
firm
,
white
,
and
comely
.
But
the
hand
which
I
*NL*
now
saw
,
clearly
enough
,
in
the
yellow
light
of
a
mid-London
*NL*
morning
,
lying
half
shut
on
the
bed-clothes
,
was
lean
,
corded
,
*NL*
knuckly
,
of
a
dusky
pallor
and
thickly
shaded
with
a
swart
growth
*NL*
of
hair
.
It
was
the
hand
of
Edward
Hyde
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
must
have
stared
upon
it
for
near
half
a
minute
,
sunk
as
I
was
*NL*
in
the
mere
stupidity
of
wonder
,
before
terror
woke
up
in
my
*NL*
breast
as
sudden
and
startling
as
the
crash
of
cymbals
;
and
*NL*
bounding
from
my
bed
,
I
rushed
to
the
mirror
.
At
the
sight
that
*NL*
met
my
eyes
,
my
blood
was
changed
into
something
exquisitely
thin
*NL*
and
icy
.
Yes
,
I
had
gone
to
bed
Henry
Jekyll
,
I
had
awakened
*NL*
Edward
Hyde
.
How
was
this
to
be
explained
?
I
asked
myself
,
and
*NL*
then
,
with
another
bound
of
terror
--
how
was
it
to
be
remedied
?
*NL*
It
was
well
on
in
the
morning
;
the
servants
were
up
;
all
my
drugs
*NL*
were
in
the
*NL*
*NL*
94
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
cabinet
--
a
long
journey
down
two
pairs
of
stairs
,
through
the
*NL*
back
passage
,
across
the
open
court
and
through
the
anatomical
*NL*
theatre
,
from
where
I
was
then
standing
horror-struck
.
It
might
*NL*
indeed
be
possible
to
cover
my
face
;
but
of
what
use
was
that
,
*NL*
when
I
was
unable
to
conceal
the
alteration
in
my
stature
?
And
*NL*
then
with
an
overpowering
sweetness
of
relief
,
it
came
back
upon
*NL*
my
mind
that
the
servants
were
already
used
to
the
coming
and
*NL*
going
of
my
second
self
.
I
had
soon
dressed
,
as
well
as
I
was
*NL*
able
,
in
clothes
of
my
own
size
:
had
soon
passed
through
the
*NL*
house
,
where
Bradshaw
stared
and
drew
back
at
seeing
Mr.
Hyde
at
*NL*
such
an
hour
and
in
such
a
strange
array
;
and
ten
minutes
later
,
*NL*
Dr.
Jekyll
had
returned
to
his
own
shape
and
was
sitting
down
,
*NL*
with
a
darkened
brow
,
to
make
a
feint
of
breakfasting
.
*NL*
*NL*
Small
indeed
was
my
appetite
.
This
inexplicable
incident
,
this
*NL*
reversal
of
my
previous
experience
,
seemed
,
like
the
Babylonian
*NL*
finger
on
the
wall
,
to
be
spelling
out
the
letters
of
my
*NL*
judgment
;
and
I
began
to
reflect
more
seriously
than
ever
before
*NL*
on
the
issues
and
possibilities
of
my
double
existence
.
That
part
*NL*
of
me
which
I
had
the
power
of
projecting
,
had
lately
been
much
*NL*
exercised
and
nourished
;
it
had
seemed
to
me
of
late
as
though
*NL*
the
body
of
Edward
Hyde
had
grown
in
stature
,
as
though
-LRB-
when
I
*NL*
wore
that
form
-RRB-
I
were
conscious
of
a
more
generous
tide
of
*NL*
blood
;
and
I
began
to
spy
a
danger
that
,
*NL*
*NL*
95
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
if
this
were
much
prolonged
,
the
balance
of
my
nature
might
be
*NL*
permanently
overthrown
,
the
power
of
voluntary
change
be
*NL*
forfeited
,
and
the
character
of
Edward
Hyde
become
irrevocably
*NL*
mine
.
The
power
of
the
drug
had
not
been
always
equally
*NL*
displayed
.
Once
,
very
early
in
my
career
,
it
had
totally
failed
*NL*
me
;
since
then
I
had
been
obliged
on
more
than
one
occasion
to
*NL*
double
,
and
once
,
with
infinite
risk
of
death
,
to
treble
the
*NL*
amount
;
and
these
rare
uncertainties
had
cast
hitherto
the
sole
*NL*
shadow
on
my
contentment
.
Now
,
however
,
and
in
the
light
of
that
*NL*
morning
's
accident
,
I
was
led
to
remark
that
whereas
,
in
the
*NL*
beginning
,
the
difficulty
had
been
to
throw
off
the
body
of
*NL*
Jekyll
,
it
had
of
late
gradually
but
decidedly
transferred
itself
*NL*
to
the
other
side
.
All
things
therefore
seemed
to
point
to
this
:
*NL*
that
I
was
slowly
losing
hold
of
my
original
and
better
self
,
and
*NL*
becoming
slowly
incorporated
with
my
second
and
worse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Between
these
two
,
I
now
felt
I
had
to
choose
.
My
two
natures
had
*NL*
memory
in
common
,
but
all
other
faculties
were
most
unequally
*NL*
shared
between
them
.
Jekyll
-LRB-
who
was
composite
-RRB-
now
with
the
most
*NL*
sensitive
apprehensions
,
now
with
a
greedy
gusto
,
projected
and
*NL*
shared
in
the
pleasures
and
adventures
of
Hyde
;
but
Hyde
was
*NL*
indifferent
to
Jekyll
,
or
but
remembered
him
as
the
mountain
*NL*
bandit
remembers
the
cavern
in
which
he
conceals
himself
from
*NL*
pursuit
.
Jekyll
had
more
than
a
father
's
interest
;
Hyde
*NL*
*NL*
96
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
had
more
than
a
son
's
indifference
.
To
cast
in
my
lot
with
*NL*
Jekyll
,
was
to
die
to
those
appetites
which
I
had
long
secretly
*NL*
indulged
and
had
of
late
begun
to
pamper
.
To
cast
it
in
with
*NL*
Hyde
,
was
to
die
to
a
thousand
interests
and
aspirations
,
and
to
*NL*
become
,
at
a
blow
and
for
ever
,
despised
and
friendless
.
The
*NL*
bargain
might
appear
unequal
;
but
there
was
still
another
*NL*
consideration
in
the
scales
;
for
while
Jekyll
would
suffer
*NL*
smartingly
in
the
fires
of
abstinence
,
Hyde
would
be
not
even
*NL*
conscious
of
all
that
he
had
lost
.
Strange
as
my
circumstances
*NL*
were
,
the
terms
of
this
debate
are
as
old
and
commonplace
as
man
;
*NL*
much
the
same
inducements
and
alarms
cast
the
die
for
any
tempted
*NL*
and
trembling
sinner
;
and
it
fell
out
with
me
,
as
it
falls
with
*NL*
so
vast
a
majority
of
my
fellows
,
that
I
chose
the
better
part
*NL*
and
was
found
wanting
in
the
strength
to
keep
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
I
preferred
the
elderly
and
discontented
doctor
,
surrounded
*NL*
by
friends
and
cherishing
honest
hopes
;
and
bade
a
resolute
*NL*
farewell
to
the
liberty
,
the
comparative
youth
,
the
light
step
,
*NL*
leaping
impulses
and
secret
pleasures
,
that
I
had
enjoyed
in
the
*NL*
disguise
of
Hyde
.
I
made
this
choice
perhaps
with
some
*NL*
unconscious
reservation
,
for
I
neither
gave
up
the
house
in
Soho
,
*NL*
nor
destroyed
the
clothes
of
Edward
Hyde
,
which
still
lay
ready
*NL*
in
my
cabinet
.
For
two
months
,
however
,
I
was
true
to
my
*NL*
determination
;
for
two
months
I
led
a
life
of
such
*NL*
*NL*
97
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
severity
as
I
had
never
before
attained
to
,
and
enjoyed
the
*NL*
compensations
of
an
approving
conscience
.
But
time
began
at
last
*NL*
to
obliterate
the
freshness
of
my
alarm
;
the
praises
of
*NL*
conscience
began
to
grow
into
a
thing
of
course
;
I
began
to
be
*NL*
tortured
with
throes
and
longings
,
as
of
Hyde
struggling
after
*NL*
freedom
;
and
at
last
,
in
an
hour
of
moral
weakness
,
I
once
again
*NL*
compounded
and
swallowed
the
transforming
draught
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
not
suppose
that
,
when
a
drunkard
reasons
with
himself
upon
*NL*
his
vice
,
he
is
once
out
of
five
hundred
times
affected
by
the
*NL*
dangers
that
he
runs
through
his
brutish
,
physical
insensibility
;
*NL*
neither
had
I
,
long
as
I
had
considered
my
position
,
made
enough
*NL*
allowance
for
the
complete
moral
insensibility
and
insensate
*NL*
readiness
to
evil
,
which
were
the
leading
characters
of
Edward
*NL*
Hyde
.
Yet
it
was
by
these
that
I
was
punished
.
My
devil
had
been
*NL*
long
caged
,
he
came
out
roaring
.
I
was
conscious
,
even
when
I
*NL*
took
the
draught
,
of
a
more
unbridled
,
a
more
furious
propensity
*NL*
to
ill
.
It
must
have
been
this
,
I
suppose
,
that
stirred
in
my
*NL*
soul
that
tempest
of
impatience
with
which
I
listened
to
the
*NL*
civilities
of
my
unhappy
victim
;
I
declare
,
at
least
,
before
God
,
*NL*
no
man
morally
sane
could
have
been
guilty
of
that
crime
upon
so
*NL*
pitiful
a
provocation
;
and
that
I
struck
in
no
more
reasonable
*NL*
spirit
than
that
in
which
a
sick
child
may
break
a
plaything
.
But
*NL*
I
had
voluntarily
stripped
myself
of
all
those
balancing
*NL*
instincts
*NL*
*NL*
98
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
by
which
even
the
worst
of
us
continues
to
walk
with
some
degree
*NL*
of
steadiness
among
temptations
;
and
in
my
case
,
to
be
tempted
,
*NL*
however
slightly
,
was
to
fall
.
*NL*
*NL*
Instantly
the
spirit
of
hell
awoke
in
me
and
raged
.
With
a
*NL*
transport
of
glee
,
I
mauled
the
unresisting
body
,
tasting
delight
*NL*
from
every
blow
;
and
it
was
not
till
weariness
had
begun
to
*NL*
succeed
,
that
I
was
suddenly
,
in
the
top
fit
of
my
delirium
,
*NL*
struck
through
the
heart
by
a
cold
thrill
of
terror
.
A
mist
*NL*
dispersed
;
I
saw
my
life
to
be
forfeit
;
and
fled
from
the
scene
*NL*
of
these
excesses
,
at
once
glorying
and
trembling
,
my
lust
of
*NL*
evil
gratified
and
stimulated
,
my
love
of
life
screwed
to
the
*NL*
topmost
peg
.
I
ran
to
the
house
in
Soho
,
and
-LRB-
to
make
assurance
*NL*
doubly
sure
-RRB-
destroyed
my
papers
;
thence
I
set
out
through
the
*NL*
lamplit
streets
,
in
the
same
divided
ecstasy
of
mind
,
gloating
on
*NL*
my
crime
,
light-headedly
devising
others
in
the
future
,
and
yet
*NL*
still
hastening
and
still
hearkening
in
my
wake
for
the
steps
of
*NL*
the
avenger
.
Hyde
had
a
song
upon
his
lips
as
he
compounded
the
*NL*
draught
,
and
as
he
drank
it
,
pledged
the
dead
man
.
The
pangs
of
*NL*
transformation
had
not
done
tearing
him
,
before
Henry
Jekyll
,
*NL*
with
streaming
tears
of
gratitude
and
remorse
,
had
fallen
upon
*NL*
his
knees
and
lifted
his
clasped
hands
to
God
.
The
veil
of
*NL*
self-indulgence
was
rent
from
head
to
foot
,
I
saw
my
life
as
a
*NL*
whole
:
I
followed
it
up
from
the
days
of
childhood
,
when
I
had
*NL*
walked
*NL*
*NL*
99
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
with
my
father
's
hand
,
and
through
the
self-denying
toils
of
my
*NL*
professional
life
,
to
arrive
again
and
again
,
with
the
same
sense
*NL*
of
unreality
,
at
the
damned
horrors
of
the
evening
.
I
could
have
*NL*
screamed
aloud
;
I
sought
with
tears
and
prayers
to
smother
down
*NL*
the
crowd
of
hideous
images
and
sounds
with
which
my
memory
*NL*
swarmed
against
me
;
and
still
,
between
the
petitions
,
the
ugly
*NL*
face
of
my
iniquity
stared
into
my
soul
.
As
the
acuteness
of
this
*NL*
remorse
began
to
die
away
,
it
was
succeeded
by
a
sense
of
joy
.
*NL*
The
problem
of
my
conduct
was
solved
.
Hyde
was
thenceforth
*NL*
impossible
;
whether
I
would
or
not
,
I
was
now
confined
to
the
*NL*
better
part
of
my
existence
;
and
oh
,
how
I
rejoiced
to
think
it
!
*NL*
with
what
willing
humility
,
I
embraced
anew
the
restrictions
of
*NL*
natural
life
!
with
what
sincere
renunciation
,
I
locked
the
door
*NL*
by
which
I
had
so
often
gone
and
come
,
and
ground
the
key
under
*NL*
my
heel
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
,
came
the
news
that
the
murder
had
been
overlooked
,
*NL*
that
the
guilt
of
Hyde
was
patent
to
the
world
,
and
that
the
*NL*
victim
was
a
man
high
in
public
estimation
.
It
was
not
only
a
*NL*
crime
,
it
had
been
a
tragic
folly
.
I
think
I
was
glad
to
know
it
;
*NL*
I
think
I
was
glad
to
have
my
better
impulses
thus
buttressed
and
*NL*
guarded
by
the
terrors
of
the
scaffold
.
Jekyll
was
now
my
city
of
*NL*
refuge
;
let
but
Hyde
peep
out
an
instant
,
and
the
hands
of
all
*NL*
men
would
be
raised
to
take
and
slay
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
100
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
I
resolved
in
my
future
conduct
to
redeem
the
past
;
and
I
can
say
*NL*
with
honesty
that
my
resolve
was
fruitful
of
some
good
.
You
know
*NL*
yourself
how
earnestly
in
the
last
months
of
last
year
,
I
*NL*
laboured
to
relieve
suffering
;
you
know
that
much
was
done
for
*NL*
others
,
and
that
the
days
passed
quietly
,
almost
happily
for
*NL*
myself
.
Nor
can
I
truly
say
that
I
wearied
of
this
beneficent
and
*NL*
innocent
life
;
I
think
instead
that
I
daily
enjoyed
it
more
*NL*
completely
;
but
I
was
still
cursed
with
my
duality
of
purpose
;
*NL*
and
as
the
first
edge
of
my
penitence
wore
off
,
the
lower
side
of
*NL*
me
,
so
long
indulged
,
so
recently
chained
down
,
began
to
growl
*NL*
for
licence
.
Not
that
I
dreamed
of
resuscitating
Hyde
;
the
bare
*NL*
idea
of
that
would
startle
me
to
frenzy
:
no
,
it
was
in
my
own
*NL*
person
,
that
I
was
once
more
tempted
to
trifle
with
my
*NL*
conscience
;
and
it
was
as
an
ordinary
secret
sinner
,
that
I
at
*NL*
last
fell
before
the
assaults
of
temptation
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
comes
an
end
to
all
things
;
the
most
capacious
measure
is
*NL*
filled
at
last
;
and
this
brief
condescension
to
evil
finally
*NL*
destroyed
the
balance
of
my
soul
.
And
yet
I
was
not
alarmed
;
the
*NL*
fall
seemed
natural
,
like
a
return
to
the
old
days
before
I
had
*NL*
made
discovery
.
It
was
a
fine
,
clear
,
January
day
,
wet
under
foot
*NL*
where
the
frost
had
melted
,
but
cloudless
overhead
;
and
the
*NL*
Regent
's
Park
was
full
of
winter
chirrupings
and
sweet
with
*NL*
spring
odours
.
I
sat
in
the
sun
on
a
bench
;
the
animal
within
me
*NL*
licking
the
*NL*
*NL*
101
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
chops
of
memory
;
the
spiritual
side
a
little
drowsed
,
promising
*NL*
subsequent
penitence
,
but
not
yet
moved
to
begin
.
After
all
,
I
*NL*
reflected
,
I
was
like
my
neighbours
;
and
then
I
smiled
,
comparing
*NL*
myself
with
other
men
,
comparing
my
active
goodwill
with
the
lazy
*NL*
cruelty
of
their
neglect
.
And
at
the
very
moment
of
that
*NL*
vain-glorious
thought
,
a
qualm
came
over
me
,
a
horrid
nausea
and
*NL*
the
most
deadly
shuddering
.
These
passed
away
,
and
left
me
faint
;
*NL*
and
then
as
in
its
turn
the
faintness
subsided
,
I
began
to
be
*NL*
aware
of
a
change
in
the
temper
of
my
thoughts
,
a
greater
*NL*
boldness
,
a
contempt
of
danger
,
a
solution
of
the
bonds
of
*NL*
obligation
.
I
looked
down
;
my
clothes
hung
formlessly
on
my
*NL*
shrunken
limbs
;
the
hand
that
lay
on
my
knee
was
corded
and
*NL*
hairy
.
I
was
once
more
Edward
Hyde
.
A
moment
before
I
had
been
*NL*
safe
of
all
men
's
respect
,
wealthy
,
beloved
--
the
cloth
laying
*NL*
for
me
in
the
dining-room
at
home
;
and
now
I
was
the
common
*NL*
quarry
of
mankind
,
hunted
,
houseless
,
a
known
murderer
,
thrall
to
*NL*
the
gallows
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
reason
wavered
,
but
it
did
not
fail
me
utterly
.
I
have
more
*NL*
than
once
observed
that
,
in
my
second
character
,
my
faculties
*NL*
seemed
sharpened
to
a
point
and
my
spirits
more
tensely
elastic
;
*NL*
thus
it
came
about
that
,
where
Jekyll
perhaps
might
have
*NL*
succumbed
,
Hyde
rose
to
the
importance
of
the
moment
.
My
drugs
*NL*
were
in
one
of
the
presses
of
my
cabinet
;
how
was
I
*NL*
*NL*
102
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
to
reach
them
?
That
was
the
problem
that
-LRB-
crushing
my
temples
in
*NL*
my
hands
-RRB-
I
set
myself
to
solve
.
The
laboratory
door
I
had
*NL*
closed
.
If
I
sought
to
enter
by
the
house
,
my
own
servants
would
*NL*
consign
me
to
the
gallows
.
I
saw
I
must
employ
another
hand
,
and
*NL*
thought
of
Lanyon
.
How
was
he
to
be
reached
?
how
persuaded
?
*NL*
Supposing
that
I
escaped
capture
in
the
streets
,
how
was
I
to
*NL*
make
my
way
into
his
presence
?
and
how
should
I
,
an
unknown
and
*NL*
displeasing
visitor
,
prevail
on
the
famous
physician
to
rifle
the
*NL*
study
of
his
colleague
,
Dr.
Jekyll
?
Then
I
remembered
that
of
my
*NL*
original
character
,
one
part
remained
to
me
:
I
could
write
my
own
*NL*
hand
;
and
once
I
had
conceived
that
kindling
spark
,
the
way
that
*NL*
I
must
follow
became
lighted
up
from
end
to
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thereupon
,
I
arranged
my
clothes
as
best
I
could
,
and
summoning
*NL*
a
passing
hansom
,
drove
to
an
hotel
in
Portland
Street
,
the
name
*NL*
of
which
I
chanced
to
remember
.
At
my
appearance
-LRB-
which
was
*NL*
indeed
comical
enough
,
however
tragic
a
fate
these
garments
*NL*
covered
-RRB-
the
driver
could
not
conceal
his
mirth
.
I
gnashed
my
*NL*
teeth
upon
him
with
a
gust
of
devilish
fury
;
and
the
smile
*NL*
withered
from
his
face
--
happily
for
him
--
yet
more
happily
for
*NL*
myself
,
for
in
another
instant
I
had
certainly
dragged
him
from
*NL*
his
perch
.
At
the
inn
,
as
I
entered
,
I
looked
about
me
with
so
*NL*
black
a
countenance
as
made
the
attendants
tremble
;
not
a
look
*NL*
did
they
exchange
in
my
*NL*
*NL*
103
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
presence
;
but
obsequiously
took
my
orders
,
led
me
to
a
private
*NL*
room
,
and
brought
me
wherewithal
to
write
.
Hyde
in
danger
of
his
*NL*
life
was
a
creature
new
to
me
;
shaken
with
inordinate
anger
,
*NL*
strung
to
the
pitch
of
murder
,
lusting
to
inflict
pain
.
Yet
the
*NL*
creature
was
astute
;
mastered
his
fury
with
a
great
effort
of
the
*NL*
will
;
composed
his
two
important
letters
,
one
to
Lanyon
and
one
*NL*
to
Poole
;
and
that
he
might
receive
actual
evidence
of
their
*NL*
being
posted
,
sent
them
out
with
directions
that
they
should
be
*NL*
registered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thenceforward
,
he
sat
all
day
over
the
fire
in
the
private
room
,
*NL*
gnawing
his
nails
;
there
he
dined
,
sitting
alone
with
his
fears
,
*NL*
the
waiter
visibly
quailing
before
his
eye
;
and
thence
,
when
the
*NL*
night
was
fully
come
,
he
set
forth
in
the
corner
of
a
closed
cab
,
*NL*
and
was
driven
to
and
fro
about
the
streets
of
the
city
.
He
,
I
*NL*
say
--
I
can
not
say
,
I
.
That
child
of
Hell
had
nothing
human
;
*NL*
nothing
lived
in
him
but
fear
and
hatred
.
And
when
at
last
,
*NL*
thinking
the
driver
had
begun
to
grow
suspicious
,
he
discharged
*NL*
the
cab
and
ventured
on
foot
,
attired
in
his
misfitting
clothes
,
*NL*
an
object
marked
out
for
observation
,
into
the
midst
of
the
*NL*
nocturnal
passengers
,
these
two
base
passions
raged
within
him
*NL*
like
a
tempest
.
He
walked
fast
,
hunted
by
his
fears
,
chattering
*NL*
to
himself
,
skulking
through
the
less-frequented
thoroughfares
,
*NL*
counting
the
minutes
that
still
divided
him
from
midnight
.
Once
a
*NL*
*NL*
104
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
woman
spoke
to
him
,
offering
,
I
think
,
a
box
of
lights
.
He
smote
*NL*
her
in
the
face
,
and
she
fled
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
came
to
myself
at
Lanyon
's
,
the
horror
of
my
old
friend
*NL*
perhaps
affected
me
somewhat
:
I
do
not
know
;
it
was
at
least
but
*NL*
a
drop
in
the
sea
to
the
abhorrence
with
which
I
looked
back
upon
*NL*
these
hours
.
A
change
had
come
over
me
.
It
was
no
longer
the
fear
*NL*
of
the
gallows
,
it
was
the
horror
of
being
Hyde
that
racked
me
.
I
*NL*
received
Lanyon
's
condemnation
partly
in
a
dream
;
it
was
partly
*NL*
in
a
dream
that
I
came
home
to
my
own
house
and
got
into
bed
.
I
*NL*
slept
after
the
prostration
of
the
day
,
with
a
stringent
and
*NL*
profound
slumber
which
not
even
the
nightmares
that
wrung
me
*NL*
could
avail
to
break
.
I
awoke
in
the
morning
shaken
,
weakened
,
*NL*
but
refreshed
.
I
still
hated
and
feared
the
thought
of
the
brute
*NL*
that
slept
within
me
,
and
I
had
not
of
course
forgotten
the
*NL*
appalling
dangers
of
the
day
before
;
but
I
was
once
more
at
home
,
*NL*
in
my
own
house
and
close
to
my
drugs
;
and
gratitude
for
my
*NL*
escape
shone
so
strong
in
my
soul
that
it
almost
rivalled
the
*NL*
brightness
of
hope
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
stepping
leisurely
across
the
court
after
breakfast
,
*NL*
drinking
the
chill
of
the
air
with
pleasure
,
when
I
was
seized
*NL*
again
with
those
indescribable
sensations
that
heralded
the
*NL*
change
;
and
I
had
but
the
time
to
gain
the
shelter
of
my
cabinet
,
*NL*
before
I
was
once
again
raging
and
freezing
with
the
passions
of
*NL*
Hyde
.
It
took
on
this
occasion
a
double
dose
to
recall
me
to
*NL*
*NL*
105
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
myself
;
and
alas
!
Six
hours
after
,
as
I
sat
looking
sadly
in
the
*NL*
fire
,
the
pangs
returned
,
and
the
drug
had
to
be
re-administered
.
*NL*
In
short
,
from
that
day
forth
it
seemed
only
by
a
great
effort
as
*NL*
of
gymnastics
,
and
only
under
the
immediate
stimulation
of
the
*NL*
drug
,
that
I
was
able
to
wear
the
countenance
of
Jekyll
.
At
all
*NL*
hours
of
the
day
and
night
,
I
would
be
taken
with
the
premonitory
*NL*
shudder
;
above
all
,
if
I
slept
,
or
even
dozed
for
a
moment
in
my
*NL*
chair
,
it
was
always
as
Hyde
that
I
awakened
.
Under
the
strain
of
*NL*
this
continually-impending
doom
and
by
the
sleeplessness
to
which
*NL*
I
now
condemned
myself
,
ay
,
even
beyond
what
I
had
thought
*NL*
possible
to
man
,
I
became
,
in
my
own
person
,
a
creature
eaten
up
*NL*
and
emptied
by
fever
,
languidly
weak
both
in
body
and
mind
,
and
*NL*
solely
occupied
by
one
thought
:
the
horror
of
my
other
self
.
But
*NL*
when
I
slept
,
or
when
the
virtue
of
the
medicine
wore
off
,
I
*NL*
would
leap
almost
without
transition
-LRB-
for
the
pangs
of
*NL*
transformation
grew
daily
less
marked
-RRB-
into
the
possession
of
a
*NL*
fancy
brimming
with
images
of
terror
,
a
soul
boiling
with
*NL*
causeless
hatreds
,
and
a
body
that
seemed
not
strong
enough
to
*NL*
contain
the
raging
energies
of
life
.
The
powers
of
Hyde
seemed
to
*NL*
have
grown
with
the
sickliness
of
Jekyll
.
And
certainly
the
hate
*NL*
that
now
divided
them
was
equal
on
each
side
.
With
Jekyll
,
it
was
*NL*
a
thing
of
vital
instinct
.
He
had
now
seen
the
full
deformity
of
*NL*
that
creature
that
shared
with
him
some
of
the
phenomena
of
*NL*
*NL*
106
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
consciousness
,
and
was
co-heir
with
him
to
death
:
and
beyond
these
*NL*
links
of
community
,
which
in
themselves
made
the
most
poignant
*NL*
part
of
his
distress
,
he
thought
of
Hyde
,
for
all
his
energy
of
*NL*
life
,
as
of
something
not
only
hellish
but
inorganic
.
This
was
the
*NL*
shocking
thing
;
that
the
slime
of
the
pit
seemed
to
utter
cries
*NL*
and
voices
;
that
the
amorphous
dust
gesticulated
and
sinned
;
that
*NL*
what
was
dead
,
and
had
no
shape
,
should
usurp
the
offices
of
life
.
*NL*
And
this
again
,
that
that
insurgent
horror
was
knit
to
him
closer
*NL*
than
a
wife
,
closer
than
an
eye
;
lay
caged
in
his
flesh
,
where
he
*NL*
heard
it
mutter
and
felt
it
struggle
to
be
born
;
and
at
every
hour
*NL*
of
weakness
,
and
in
the
confidence
of
slumber
,
prevailed
against
*NL*
him
and
deposed
him
out
of
life
.
The
hatred
of
Hyde
for
Jekyll
,
*NL*
was
of
a
different
order
.
His
terror
of
the
gallows
drove
him
*NL*
continually
to
commit
temporary
suicide
,
and
return
to
his
*NL*
subordinate
station
of
a
part
instead
of
a
person
;
but
he
loathed
*NL*
the
necessity
,
he
loathed
the
despondency
into
which
Jekyll
was
*NL*
now
fallen
,
and
he
resented
the
dislike
with
which
he
was
himself
*NL*
regarded
.
Hence
the
ape-like
tricks
that
he
would
play
me
,
*NL*
scrawling
in
my
own
hand
blasphemies
on
the
pages
of
my
books
,
*NL*
burning
the
letters
and
destroying
the
portrait
of
my
father
;
and
*NL*
indeed
,
had
it
not
been
for
his
fear
of
death
,
he
would
long
ago
*NL*
have
ruined
himself
in
order
to
involve
me
in
the
ruin
.
But
his
*NL*
love
of
life
is
wonderful
;
I
go
further
:
I
,
who
sicken
*NL*
*NL*
107
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
and
freeze
at
the
mere
thought
of
him
,
when
I
recall
the
*NL*
abjection
and
passion
of
this
attachment
,
and
when
I
know
how
he
*NL*
fears
my
power
to
cut
him
off
by
suicide
,
I
find
it
in
my
heart
*NL*
to
pity
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
useless
,
and
the
time
awfully
fails
me
,
to
prolong
this
*NL*
description
;
no
one
has
ever
suffered
such
torments
,
let
that
*NL*
suffice
;
and
yet
even
to
these
,
habit
brought
--
no
,
not
*NL*
alleviation
--
but
a
certain
callousness
of
soul
,
a
certain
*NL*
acquiescence
of
despair
;
and
my
punishment
might
have
gone
on
for
*NL*
years
,
but
for
the
last
calamity
which
has
now
fallen
,
and
which
*NL*
has
finally
severed
me
from
my
own
face
and
nature
.
My
provision
*NL*
of
the
salt
,
which
had
never
been
renewed
since
the
date
of
the
*NL*
first
experiment
,
began
to
run
low
.
I
sent
out
for
a
fresh
*NL*
supply
,
and
mixed
the
draught
;
the
ebullition
followed
,
and
the
*NL*
first
change
of
colour
,
not
the
second
;
I
drank
it
and
it
was
*NL*
without
efficiency
.
You
will
learn
from
Poole
how
I
have
had
*NL*
London
ransacked
;
it
was
in
vain
;
and
I
am
now
persuaded
that
my
*NL*
first
supply
was
impure
,
and
that
it
was
that
unknown
impurity
*NL*
which
lent
efficacy
to
the
draught
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
a
week
has
passed
,
and
I
am
now
finishing
this
statement
*NL*
under
the
influence
of
the
last
of
the
old
powders
.
This
,
then
,
*NL*
is
the
last
time
,
short
of
a
miracle
,
that
Henry
Jekyll
can
think
*NL*
his
own
thoughts
or
see
his
own
face
-LRB-
now
how
sadly
altered
!
-RRB-
*NL*
in
the
glass
.
Nor
must
I
delay
*NL*
*NL*
108
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
too
long
to
bring
my
writing
to
an
end
;
for
if
my
narrative
has
*NL*
hitherto
escaped
destruction
,
it
has
been
by
a
combination
of
*NL*
great
prudence
and
great
good
luck
.
Should
the
throes
of
change
*NL*
take
me
in
the
act
of
writing
it
,
Hyde
will
tear
it
in
pieces
;
*NL*
but
if
some
time
shall
have
elapsed
after
I
have
laid
it
by
,
his
*NL*
wonderful
selfishness
and
Circumscription
to
the
moment
will
*NL*
probably
save
it
once
again
from
the
action
of
his
ape-like
*NL*
spite
.
And
indeed
the
doom
that
is
closing
on
us
both
,
has
*NL*
already
changed
and
crushed
him
.
Half
an
hour
from
now
,
when
I
*NL*
shall
again
and
for
ever
re-indue
that
hated
personality
,
I
know
*NL*
how
I
shall
sit
shuddering
and
weeping
in
my
chair
,
or
continue
,
*NL*
with
the
most
strained
and
fear-struck
ecstasy
of
listening
,
to
*NL*
pace
up
and
down
this
room
-LRB-
my
last
earthly
refuge
-RRB-
and
give
ear
*NL*
to
every
sound
of
menace
.
Will
Hyde
die
upon
the
scaffold
?
or
*NL*
will
he
find
courage
to
release
himself
at
the
last
moment
?
God
*NL*
knows
;
I
am
careless
;
this
is
my
true
hour
of
death
,
and
what
is
*NL*
to
follow
concerns
another
than
myself
.
Here
then
,
as
I
lay
down
*NL*
the
pen
and
proceed
to
seal
up
my
confession
,
I
bring
the
life
of
*NL*
that
unhappy
Henry
Jekyll
to
an
end
.
