The
schoolmaster
was
leaving
the
village
,
and
everybody
seemed
sorry
.
*NL*
The
miller
at
Cresscombe
lent
him
the
small
white
tilted
cart
and
*NL*
horse
to
carry
his
goods
to
the
city
of
his
destination
,
about
twenty
*NL*
miles
off
,
such
a
vehicle
proving
of
quite
sufficient
size
for
the
*NL*
departing
teacher
's
effects
.
For
the
schoolhouse
had
been
partly
*NL*
furnished
by
the
managers
,
and
the
only
cumbersome
article
possessed
*NL*
by
the
master
,
in
addition
to
the
packing-case
of
books
,
was
a
*NL*
cottage
piano
that
he
had
bought
at
an
auction
during
the
year
in
*NL*
which
he
thought
of
learning
instrumental
music
.
But
the
enthusiasm
*NL*
having
waned
he
had
never
acquired
any
skill
in
playing
,
and
the
*NL*
purchased
article
had
been
a
perpetual
trouble
to
him
ever
since
in
*NL*
moving
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rector
had
gone
away
for
the
day
,
being
a
man
who
disliked
the
*NL*
sight
of
changes
.
He
did
not
mean
to
return
till
the
evening
,
when
*NL*
the
new
school-teacher
would
have
arrived
and
settled
in
,
and
*NL*
everything
would
be
smooth
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
blacksmith
,
the
farm
bailiff
,
and
the
schoolmaster
himself
were
*NL*
standing
in
perplexed
attitudes
in
the
parlour
before
the
instrument
.
*NL*
The
master
had
remarked
that
even
if
he
got
it
into
the
cart
he
*NL*
should
not
know
what
to
do
with
it
on
his
arrival
at
Christminster
,
*NL*
the
city
he
was
bound
for
,
since
he
was
only
going
into
temporary
*NL*
lodgings
just
at
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
little
boy
of
eleven
,
who
had
been
thoughtfully
assisting
in
the
*NL*
packing
,
joined
the
group
of
men
,
and
as
they
rubbed
their
chins
he
*NL*
spoke
up
,
blushing
at
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
:
``
Aunt
have
got
a
*NL*
great
fuel-house
,
and
it
could
be
put
there
,
perhaps
,
till
you
've
*NL*
found
a
place
to
settle
in
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
proper
good
notion
,
''
said
the
blacksmith
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
decided
that
a
deputation
should
wait
on
the
boy
's
aunt
--
an
*NL*
old
maiden
resident
--
and
ask
her
if
she
would
house
the
piano
till
*NL*
Mr.
Phillotson
should
send
for
it
.
The
smith
and
the
bailiff
started
*NL*
to
see
about
the
practicability
of
the
suggested
shelter
,
and
the
boy
*NL*
and
the
schoolmaster
were
left
standing
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sorry
I
am
going
,
Jude
?
''
asked
the
latter
kindly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tears
rose
into
the
boy
's
eyes
,
for
he
was
not
among
the
regular
day
*NL*
scholars
,
who
came
unromantically
close
to
the
schoolmaster
's
life
,
*NL*
but
one
who
had
attended
the
night
school
only
during
the
present
*NL*
teacher
's
term
of
office
.
The
regular
scholars
,
if
the
truth
must
*NL*
be
told
,
stood
at
the
present
moment
afar
off
,
like
certain
historic
*NL*
disciples
,
indisposed
to
any
enthusiastic
volunteering
of
aid
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
awkwardly
opened
the
book
he
held
in
his
hand
,
which
Mr.
*NL*
Phillotson
had
bestowed
on
him
as
a
parting
gift
,
and
admitted
that
*NL*
he
was
sorry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
am
I
,
''
said
Mr.
Phillotson
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
go
,
sir
?
''
asked
the
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
--
that
would
be
a
long
story
.
You
would
n't
understand
my
reasons
,
*NL*
Jude
.
You
will
,
perhaps
,
when
you
are
older
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
should
now
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
do
n't
speak
of
this
everywhere
.
You
know
what
a
university
*NL*
is
,
and
a
university
degree
?
It
is
the
necessary
hallmark
of
a
man
*NL*
who
wants
to
do
anything
in
teaching
.
My
scheme
,
or
dream
,
is
to
be
*NL*
a
university
graduate
,
and
then
to
be
ordained
.
By
going
to
live
at
*NL*
Christminster
,
or
near
it
,
I
shall
be
at
headquarters
,
so
to
speak
,
*NL*
and
if
my
scheme
is
practicable
at
all
,
I
consider
that
being
on
the
*NL*
spot
will
afford
me
a
better
chance
of
carrying
it
out
than
I
should
*NL*
have
elsewhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
smith
and
his
companion
returned
.
Old
Miss
Fawley
's
fuel-house
*NL*
was
dry
,
and
eminently
practicable
;
and
she
seemed
willing
to
give
*NL*
the
instrument
standing-room
there
.
It
was
accordingly
left
in
*NL*
the
school
till
the
evening
,
when
more
hands
would
be
available
for
*NL*
removing
it
;
and
the
schoolmaster
gave
a
final
glance
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
Jude
assisted
in
loading
some
small
articles
,
and
at
nine
*NL*
o'clock
Mr.
Phillotson
mounted
beside
his
box
of
books
and
other
*NL*
_
impedimenta
_
,
and
bade
his
friends
good-bye
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
sha
n't
forget
you
,
Jude
,
''
he
said
,
smiling
,
as
the
cart
moved
off
.
*NL*
``
Be
a
good
boy
,
remember
;
and
be
kind
to
animals
and
birds
,
and
read
*NL*
all
you
can
.
And
if
ever
you
come
to
Christminster
remember
you
hunt
*NL*
me
out
for
old
acquaintance
'
sake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
cart
creaked
across
the
green
,
and
disappeared
round
the
corner
*NL*
by
the
rectory-house
.
The
boy
returned
to
the
draw-well
at
the
edge
*NL*
of
the
greensward
,
where
he
had
left
his
buckets
when
he
went
to
help
*NL*
his
patron
and
teacher
in
the
loading
.
There
was
a
quiver
in
his
lip
*NL*
now
and
after
opening
the
well-cover
to
begin
lowering
the
bucket
he
*NL*
paused
and
leant
with
his
forehead
and
arms
against
the
framework
,
*NL*
his
face
wearing
the
fixity
of
a
thoughtful
child
's
who
has
felt
the
*NL*
pricks
of
life
somewhat
before
his
time
.
The
well
into
which
he
was
*NL*
looking
was
as
ancient
as
the
village
itself
,
and
from
his
present
*NL*
position
appeared
as
a
long
circular
perspective
ending
in
a
shining
*NL*
disk
of
quivering
water
at
a
distance
of
a
hundred
feet
down
.
*NL*
There
was
a
lining
of
green
moss
near
the
top
,
and
nearer
still
the
*NL*
hart
's
-
tongue
fern
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
to
himself
,
in
the
melodramatic
tones
of
a
whimsical
boy
,
*NL*
that
the
schoolmaster
had
drawn
at
that
well
scores
of
times
on
a
*NL*
morning
like
this
,
and
would
never
draw
there
any
more
.
``
I
've
seen
*NL*
him
look
down
into
it
,
when
he
was
tired
with
his
drawing
,
just
as
I
*NL*
do
now
,
and
when
he
rested
a
bit
before
carrying
the
buckets
home
!
*NL*
But
he
was
too
clever
to
bide
here
any
longer
--
a
small
sleepy
place
*NL*
like
this
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
tear
rolled
from
his
eye
into
the
depths
of
the
well
.
The
morning
*NL*
was
a
little
foggy
,
and
the
boy
's
breathing
unfurled
itself
as
*NL*
a
thicker
fog
upon
the
still
and
heavy
air
.
His
thoughts
were
*NL*
interrupted
by
a
sudden
outcry
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bring
on
that
water
,
will
ye
,
you
idle
young
harlican
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
came
from
an
old
woman
who
had
emerged
from
her
door
towards
the
*NL*
garden
gate
of
a
green-thatched
cottage
not
far
off
.
The
boy
quickly
*NL*
waved
a
signal
of
assent
,
drew
the
water
with
what
was
a
great
effort
*NL*
for
one
of
his
stature
,
landed
and
emptied
the
big
bucket
into
his
*NL*
own
pair
of
smaller
ones
,
and
pausing
a
moment
for
breath
,
started
*NL*
with
them
across
the
patch
of
clammy
greensward
whereon
the
well
*NL*
stood
--
nearly
in
the
centre
of
the
little
village
,
or
rather
hamlet
*NL*
of
Marygreen
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
as
old-fashioned
as
it
was
small
,
and
it
rested
in
the
lap
of
*NL*
an
undulating
upland
adjoining
the
North
Wessex
downs
.
Old
as
it
*NL*
was
,
however
,
the
well-shaft
was
probably
the
only
relic
of
the
local
*NL*
history
that
remained
absolutely
unchanged
.
Many
of
the
thatched
*NL*
and
dormered
dwelling-houses
had
been
pulled
down
of
late
years
,
and
*NL*
many
trees
felled
on
the
green
.
Above
all
,
the
original
church
,
*NL*
hump-backed
,
wood-turreted
,
and
quaintly
hipped
,
had
been
taken
*NL*
down
,
and
either
cracked
up
into
heaps
of
road-metal
in
the
lane
,
or
*NL*
utilized
as
pig-sty
walls
,
garden
seats
,
guard-stones
to
fences
,
and
*NL*
rockeries
in
the
flower-beds
of
the
neighbourhood
.
In
place
of
it
*NL*
a
tall
new
building
of
modern
Gothic
design
,
unfamiliar
to
English
*NL*
eyes
,
had
been
erected
on
a
new
piece
of
ground
by
a
certain
*NL*
obliterator
of
historic
records
who
had
run
down
from
London
and
back
*NL*
in
a
day
.
The
site
whereon
so
long
had
stood
the
ancient
temple
to
*NL*
the
Christian
divinities
was
not
even
recorded
on
the
green
and
level
*NL*
grass-plot
that
had
immemorially
been
the
churchyard
,
the
obliterated
*NL*
graves
being
commemorated
by
eighteen-penny
cast-iron
crosses
*NL*
warranted
to
last
five
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Slender
as
was
Jude
Fawley
's
frame
he
bore
the
two
brimming
*NL*
house-buckets
of
water
to
the
cottage
without
resting
.
Over
the
door
*NL*
was
a
little
rectangular
piece
of
blue
board
,
on
which
was
painted
*NL*
in
yellow
letters
,
``
Drusilla
Fawley
,
Baker
.
''
Within
the
little
lead
*NL*
panes
of
the
window
--
this
being
one
of
the
few
old
houses
left
--
were
*NL*
five
bottles
of
sweets
,
and
three
buns
on
a
plate
of
the
willow
*NL*
pattern
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
emptying
the
buckets
at
the
back
of
the
house
he
could
hear
an
*NL*
animated
conversation
in
progress
within-doors
between
his
great-aunt
,
*NL*
the
Drusilla
of
the
sign-board
,
and
some
other
villagers
.
Having
*NL*
seen
the
school-master
depart
,
they
were
summing
up
particulars
of
*NL*
the
event
,
and
indulging
in
predictions
of
his
future
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
's
he
?
''
asked
one
,
comparatively
a
stranger
,
when
the
boy
*NL*
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
ye
med
ask
it
,
Mrs.
Williams
.
He
's
my
great-nephew
--
come
since
*NL*
you
was
last
this
way
.
''
The
old
inhabitant
who
answered
was
a
tall
,
*NL*
gaunt
woman
,
who
spoke
tragically
on
the
most
trivial
subject
,
and
*NL*
gave
a
phrase
of
her
conversation
to
each
auditor
in
turn
.
``
He
come
*NL*
from
Mellstock
,
down
in
South
Wessex
,
about
a
year
ago
--
worse
luck
*NL*
for
`

,
Belinda
''
-LRB-
turning
to
the
right
-RRB-
``
where
his
father
was
living
,
*NL*
and
was
took
wi

the
shakings
for
death
,
and
died
in
two
days
,
as
you
*NL*
know

Caroline

-LRB-
turning
to
the
left
-RRB-
.
``
It
would
ha

been
a
blessing
*NL*
if
Goddy-mighty
had
took
thee
too
,
wi

thy
mother
and
father
,
poor
*NL*
useless
boy

But
I
've
got
him
here
to
stay
with
me
till
I
can
see
*NL*
what
's
to
be
done
with

,
though
I
am
obliged
to
let
him
earn
any
*NL*
penny
he
can

Just
now
he
's
a-scaring
of
birds
for
Farmer
Troutham
.
*NL*
It
keeps
him
out
of
mischty
.
Why
do
ye
turn
away
,
Jude
?
''
she
*NL*
continued
,
as
the
boy
,
feeling
the
impact
of
their
glances
like
slaps
*NL*
upon
his
face
,
moved
aside
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
local
washerwoman
replied
that
it
was
perhaps
a
very
good
plan
of
*NL*
Miss
or
Mrs.
Fawley
's
-LRB-
as
they
called
her
indifferently
-RRB-
to
have
him
*NL*
with
her
--
``
to
kip
`
ee
company
in
your
loneliness
,

shet
*NL*

winder-shetters
o

nights
,
and
help
in
the
bit
o

baking

''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Fawley
doubted
it
...
``
Why
did
n't
ye
get
the
schoolmaster
to
*NL*
take

Christminster

un

and
make
a
scholar

''
she
*NL*
continued
,
in
frowning
pleasantry
.
``
I
'm
sure
he
could
n't
ha
'
took
a
*NL*
better
one
.
The
boy
is
crazy
for
books
,
that
he
is
.
It
runs
in
our
*NL*
family
rather
.
His
cousin
Sue
is
just
the
same

so
I
've
heard
;
but
*NL*
I
have
not
seen
the

for
years
,
though
she
was
born
in
this

place

within

four
walls

as
it
happened
.
My

her

,
after
they
were
married
,
didn

get
a

you
ever
marry
.
'T
is
n't
for
the
*NL*
Fawleys
to
take
that
step
any
more
.
She
,
their
only
one
,
was
like
*NL*
a
child
o
'
my
own
,
Belinda
,
till
the
split
come
!
Ah
,
that
a
little
*NL*
maid
should
know
such
changes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
,
finding
the
general
attention
again
centering
on
himself
,
went
*NL*
out
to
the
bakehouse
,
where
he
ate
the
cake
provided
for
his
*NL*
breakfast
.
The
end
of
his
spare
time
had
now
arrived
,
and
emerging
*NL*
from
the
garden
by
getting
over
the
hedge
at
the
back
he
pursued
a
*NL*
path
northward
,
till
he
came
to
a
wide
and
lonely
depression
in
the
*NL*
general
level
of
the
upland
,
which
was
sown
as
a
corn-field
.
This
*NL*
vast
concave
was
the
scene
of
his
labours
for
Mr
Troutham
the
farmer
,
*NL*
and
he
descended
into
the
midst
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
brown
surface
of
the
field
went
right
up
towards
the
sky
all
*NL*
round
,
where
it
was
lost
by
degrees
in
the
mist
that
shut
out
the
*NL*
actual
verge
and
accentuated
the
solitude
.
The
only
marks
on
the
*NL*
uniformity
of
the
scene
were
a
rick
of
last
year
's
produce
standing
*NL*
in
the
midst
of
the
arable
,
the
rooks
that
rose
at
his
approach
,
and
*NL*
the
path
athwart
the
fallow
by
which
he
had
come
,
trodden
now
by
he
*NL*
hardly
knew
whom
,
though
once
by
many
of
his
own
dead
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
ugly
it
is
here
!
''
he
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fresh
harrow-lines
seemed
to
stretch
like
the
channellings
in
*NL*
a
piece
of
new
corduroy
,
lending
a
meanly
utilitarian
air
to
the
*NL*
expanse
,
taking
away
its
gradations
,
and
depriving
it
of
all
history
*NL*
beyond
that
of
the
few
recent
months
,
though
to
every
clod
and
stone
*NL*
there
really
attached
associations
enough
and
to
spare
--
echoes
of
*NL*
songs
from
ancient
harvest-days
,
of
spoken
words
,
and
of
sturdy
*NL*
deeds
.
Every
inch
of
ground
had
been
the
site
,
first
or
last
,
*NL*
of
energy
,
gaiety
,
horse-play
,
bickerings
,
weariness
.
Groups
of
*NL*
gleaners
had
squatted
in
the
sun
on
every
square
yard
.
Love-matches
*NL*
that
had
populated
the
adjoining
hamlet
had
been
made
up
there
*NL*
between
reaping
and
carrying
.
Under
the
hedge
which
divided
the
*NL*
field
from
a
distant
plantation
girls
had
given
themselves
to
lovers
*NL*
who
would
not
turn
their
heads
to
look
at
them
by
the
next
harvest
;
*NL*
and
in
that
ancient
cornfield
many
a
man
had
made
love-promises
to
*NL*
a
woman
at
whose
voice
he
had
trembled
by
the
next
seed-time
after
*NL*
fulfilling
them
in
the
church
adjoining
.
But
this
neither
Jude
nor
*NL*
the
rooks
around
him
considered
.
For
them
it
was
a
lonely
place
,
*NL*
possessing
,
in
the
one
view
,
only
the
quality
of
a
work-ground
,
and
*NL*
in
the
other
that
of
a
granary
good
to
feed
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
stood
under
the
rick
before
mentioned
,
and
every
few
seconds
*NL*
used
his
clacker
or
rattle
briskly
.
At
each
clack
the
rooks
left
off
*NL*
pecking
,
and
rose
and
went
away
on
their
leisurely
wings
,
burnished
*NL*
like
tassets
of
mail
,
afterwards
wheeling
back
and
regarding
him
*NL*
warily
,
and
descending
to
feed
at
a
more
respectful
distance
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sounded
the
clacker
till
his
arm
ached
,
and
at
length
his
heart
*NL*
grew
sympathetic
with
the
birds
'
thwarted
desires
.
They
seemed
,
like
*NL*
himself
,
to
be
living
in
a
world
which
did
not
want
them
.
Why
should
*NL*
he
frighten
them
away
?
They
took
upon
more
and
more
the
aspect
of
*NL*
gentle
friends
and
pensioners
--
the
only
friends
he
could
claim
as
*NL*
being
in
the
least
degree
interested
in
him
,
for
his
aunt
had
often
*NL*
told
him
that
she
was
not
.
He
ceased
his
rattling
,
and
they
alighted
*NL*
anew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
little
dears
!
''
said
Jude
,
aloud
.
``
You
SHALL
have
some
dinner
--
*NL*
you
shall
.
There
is
enough
for
us
all
.
Farmer
Troutham
can
afford
*NL*
to
let
you
have
some
.
Eat
,
then
my
dear
little
birdies
,
and
make
a
*NL*
good
meal
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
stayed
and
ate
,
inky
spots
on
the
nut-brown
soil
,
and
Jude
*NL*
enjoyed
their
appetite
.
A
magic
thread
of
fellow-feeling
united
his
*NL*
own
life
with
theirs
.
Puny
and
sorry
as
those
lives
were
,
they
much
*NL*
resembled
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
clacker
he
had
by
this
time
thrown
away
from
him
,
as
being
a
mean
*NL*
and
sordid
instrument
,
offensive
both
to
the
birds
and
to
himself
*NL*
as
their
friend
.
All
at
once
he
became
conscious
of
a
smart
blow
*NL*
upon
his
buttocks
,
followed
by
a
loud
clack
,
which
announced
to
his
*NL*
surprised
senses
that
the
clacker
had
been
the
instrument
of
offence
*NL*
used
.
The
birds
and
Jude
started
up
simultaneously
,
and
the
dazed
*NL*
eyes
of
the
latter
beheld
the
farmer
in
person
,
the
great
Troutham
*NL*
himself
,
his
red
face
glaring
down
upon
Jude
's
cowering
frame
,
the
*NL*
clacker
swinging
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
it
's
`
Eat
my
dear
birdies
,
'
is
it
,
young
man
?
`
Eat
,
dear
*NL*
birdies
,
'
indeed
!
I
'll
tickle
your
breeches
,
and
see
if
you
say
,
*NL*
`
Eat
,
dear
birdies
,
'
again
in
a
hurry
!
And
you
've
been
idling
at
the
*NL*
schoolmaster
's
too
,
instead
of
coming
here
,
ha
'n'
t
ye
,
hey
?
That
's
*NL*
how
you
earn
your
sixpence
a
day
for
keeping
the
rooks
off
my
corn
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Whilst
saluting
Jude
's
ears
with
this
impassioned
rhetoric
,
Troutham
*NL*
had
seized
his
left
hand
with
his
own
left
,
and
swinging
his
slim
*NL*
frame
round
him
at
arm
's
-
length
,
again
struck
Jude
on
the
hind
parts
*NL*
with
the
flat
side
of
Jude
's
own
rattle
,
till
the
field
echoed
with
*NL*
the
blows
,
which
were
delivered
once
or
twice
at
each
revolution
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
`
ee
,
sir
--
please
do
n't
`
ee
!
''
cried
the
whirling
child
,
as
*NL*
helpless
under
the
centrifugal
tendency
of
his
person
as
a
hooked
*NL*
fish
swinging
to
land
,
and
beholding
the
hill
,
the
rick
,
the
*NL*
plantation
,
the
path
,
and
the
rooks
going
round
and
round
him
in
an
*NL*
amazing
circular
race
.
``
I
--
I
sir
--
only
meant
that
--
there
was
a
good
*NL*
crop
in
the
ground
--
I
saw
'em
sow
it
--
and
the
rooks
could
have
a
*NL*
little
bit
for
dinner
--
and
you
would
n't
miss
it
,
sir
--
and
Mr.
*NL*
Phillotson
said
I
was
to
be
kind
to
'em
--
oh
,
oh
,
oh
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
truthful
explanation
seemed
to
exasperate
the
farmer
even
more
*NL*
than
if
Jude
had
stoutly
denied
saying
anything
at
all
,
and
he
still
*NL*
smacked
the
whirling
urchin
,
the
clacks
of
the
instrument
continuing
*NL*
to
resound
all
across
the
field
and
as
far
as
the
ears
of
distant
*NL*
workers
--
who
gathered
thereupon
that
Jude
was
pursuing
his
business
*NL*
of
clacking
with
great
assiduity
--
and
echoing
from
the
brand-new
*NL*
church
tower
just
behind
the
mist
,
towards
the
building
of
which
*NL*
structure
the
farmer
had
largely
subscribed
,
to
testify
his
love
for
*NL*
God
and
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
Troutham
grew
tired
of
his
punitive
task
,
and
depositing
*NL*
the
quivering
boy
on
his
legs
,
took
a
sixpence
from
his
pocket
and
*NL*
gave
it
him
in
payment
for
his
day
's
work
,
telling
him
to
go
home
and
*NL*
never
let
him
see
him
in
one
of
those
fields
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
leaped
out
of
arm
's
reach
,
and
walked
along
the
trackway
*NL*
weeping
--
not
from
the
pain
,
though
that
was
keen
enough
;
not
from
the
*NL*
perception
of
the
flaw
in
the
terrestrial
scheme
,
by
which
what
was
*NL*
good
for
God
's
birds
was
bad
for
God
's
gardener
;
but
with
the
awful
*NL*
sense
that
he
had
wholly
disgraced
himself
before
he
had
been
a
year
*NL*
in
the
parish
,
and
hence
might
be
a
burden
to
his
great-aunt
for
*NL*
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
shadow
on
his
mind
he
did
not
care
to
show
himself
in
the
*NL*
village
,
and
went
homeward
by
a
roundabout
track
behind
a
high
hedge
*NL*
and
across
a
pasture
.
Here
he
beheld
scores
of
coupled
earthworms
*NL*
lying
half
their
length
on
the
surface
of
the
damp
ground
,
as
*NL*
they
always
did
in
such
weather
at
that
time
of
the
year
.
It
was
*NL*
impossible
to
advance
in
regular
steps
without
crushing
some
of
them
*NL*
at
each
tread
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
Farmer
Troutham
had
just
hurt
him
,
he
was
a
boy
who
could
not
*NL*
himself
bear
to
hurt
anything
.
He
had
never
brought
home
a
nest
of
*NL*
young
birds
without
lying
awake
in
misery
half
the
night
after
,
and
*NL*
often
reinstating
them
and
the
nest
in
their
original
place
the
next
*NL*
morning
.
He
could
scarcely
bear
to
see
trees
cut
down
or
lopped
,
*NL*
from
a
fancy
that
it
hurt
them
;
and
late
pruning
,
when
the
sap
was
up
*NL*
and
the
tree
bled
profusely
,
had
been
a
positive
grief
to
him
in
his
*NL*
infancy
.
This
weakness
of
character
,
as
it
may
be
called
,
suggested
*NL*
that
he
was
the
sort
of
man
who
was
born
to
ache
a
good
deal
before
*NL*
the
fall
of
the
curtain
upon
his
unnecessary
life
should
signify
that
*NL*
all
was
well
with
him
again
.
He
carefully
picked
his
way
on
tiptoe
*NL*
among
the
earthworms
,
without
killing
a
single
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
entering
the
cottage
he
found
his
aunt
selling
a
penny
loaf
to
a
*NL*
little
girl
,
and
when
the
customer
was
gone
she
said
,
``
Well
,
how
do
*NL*
you
come
to
be
back
here
in
the
middle
of
the
morning
like
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
turned
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Troutham
have
turned
me
away
because
I
let
the
rooks
have
a
few
*NL*
peckings
of
corn
.
And
there
's
my
wages
--
the
last
I
shall
ever
hae
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
threw
the
sixpence
tragically
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
his
aunt
,
suspending
her
breath
.
And
she
opened
upon
him
*NL*
a
lecture
on
how
she
would
now
have
him
all
the
spring
upon
her
hands
*NL*
doing
nothing
.
``
If
you
ca
n't
skeer
birds
,
what
can
ye
do
?
There
!
*NL*
do
n't
ye
look
so
deedy
!
Farmer
Troutham
is
not
so
much
better
than
*NL*
myself
,
come
to
that
.
But
't
is
as
Job
said
,
`
Now
they
that
are
*NL*
younger
than
I
have
me
in
derision
,
whose
fathers
I
would
have
*NL*
disdained
to
have
set
with
the
dogs
of
my
flock
.
'
His
father
was
my
*NL*
father
's
journeyman
,
anyhow
,
and
I
must
have
been
a
fool
to
let
`
ee
*NL*
go
to
work
for

n
,
which
I
should
n't
ha
'
done
but
to
keep

out
of
*NL*
mischty

''
*NL*
*NL*
More
angry
with
Jude
for
demeaning
her
by
coming
there
than
for
*NL*
dereliction
of
duty
,
she
rated
him
primarily
from
that
point
of
view
,
*NL*
and
only
secondarily
from
a
moral
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

asked
the

after
meditating
in
silence
.

``

*NL*
Jude
went
out
,
and
,
feeling
more
than
ever
his
existence
to
be
an
*NL*
undemanded
one
,
he
lay
down
upon
his
back
on
a
heap
of
litter
near
*NL*
the
pig-sty
.
The
fog
had
by
this
time
become
more
translucent
,
and
*NL*
the
position
of
the
sun
could
be
seen
through
it
.
He
pulled
his
*NL*
straw
hat
over
his
face
,
and
peered
through
the
interstices
of
the
*NL*
plaiting
at
the
white
brightness
,
vaguely
reflecting
.
Growing
up
*NL*
brought
responsibilities
,
he
found
.
Events
did
not
rhyme
quite
as
*NL*
he
had
thought
.
Nature
's
logic
was
too
horrid
for
him
to
care
for
.
*NL*
That
mercy
towards
one
set
of
creatures
was
cruelty
towards
another
*NL*
sickened
his
sense
of
harmony
.
As
you
got
older
,
and
felt
yourself
*NL*
to
be
at
the
centre
of
your
time
,
and
not
at
a
point
in
its
*NL*
circumference
,
as
you
had
felt
when
you
were
little
,
you
were
seized
*NL*
with
a
sort
of
shuddering
,
he
perceived
.
All
around
you
there
seemed
*NL*
to
be
something
glaring
,
garish
,
rattling
,
and
the
noises
and
glares
*NL*
hit
upon
the
little
cell
called
your
life
,
and
shook
it
,
and
warped
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
he
could
only
prevent
himself
growing
up
!
He
did
not
want
to
be
a
*NL*
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
like
the
natural
boy
,
he
forgot
his
despondency
,
and
sprang
up
.
*NL*
During
the
remainder
of
the
morning
he
helped
his
aunt
,
and
in
the
*NL*
afternoon
,
when
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
done
,
he
went
into
the
*NL*
village
.
Here
he
asked
a
man
whereabouts
Christminster
lay
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Christminster
?
Oh
,
well
,
out
by
there
yonder
;
though
I
've
never
bin
*NL*
there
--
not
I.
I
've
never
had
any
business
at
such
a
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
pointed
north-eastward
,
in
the
very
direction
where
lay
that
*NL*
field
in
which
Jude
had
so
disgraced
himself
.
There
was
something
*NL*
unpleasant
about
the
coincidence
for
the
moment
,
but
the
fearsomeness
*NL*
of
this
fact
rather
increased
his
curiosity
about
the
city
.
The
*NL*
farmer
had
said
he
was
never
to
be
seen
in
that
field
again
;
yet
*NL*
Christminster
lay
across
it
,
and
the
path
was
a
public
one
.
So
,
*NL*
stealing
out
of
the
hamlet
,
he
descended
into
the
same
hollow
which
*NL*
had
witnessed
his
punishment
in
the
morning
,
never
swerving
an
inch
*NL*
from
the
path
,
and
climbing
up
the
long
and
tedious
ascent
on
the
*NL*
other
side
till
the
track
joined
the
highway
by
a
little
clump
of
*NL*
trees
.
Here
the
ploughed
land
ended
,
and
all
before
him
was
bleak
*NL*
open
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Not
a
soul
was
visible
on
the
hedgeless
highway
,
or
on
either
side
of
*NL*
it
,
and
the
white
road
seemed
to
ascend
and
diminish
till
it
joined
*NL*
the
sky
.
At
the
very
top
it
was
crossed
at
right
angles
by
a
green
*NL*
``
ridgeway
''
--
the
Ickneild
Street
and
original
Roman
road
through
the
*NL*
district
.
This
ancient
track
ran
east
and
west
for
many
miles
,
and
*NL*
down
almost
to
within
living
memory
had
been
used
for
driving
flocks
*NL*
and
herds
to
fairs
and
markets
.
But
it
was
now
neglected
and
*NL*
overgrown
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
had
never
before
strayed
so
far
north
as
this
from
the
*NL*
nestling
hamlet
in
which
he
had
been
deposited
by
the
carrier
from
a
*NL*
railway
station
southward
,
one
dark
evening
some
few
months
earlier
,
*NL*
and
till
now
he
had
had
no
suspicion
that
such
a
wide
,
flat
,
*NL*
low-lying
country
lay
so
near
at
hand
,
under
the
very
verge
of
his
*NL*
upland
world
.
The
whole
northern
semicircle
between
east
and
west
,
*NL*
to
a
distance
of
forty
or
fifty
miles
,
spread
itself
before
him
;
a
*NL*
bluer
,
moister
atmosphere
,
evidently
,
than
that
he
breathed
up
here
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
far
from
the
road
stood
a
weather-beaten
old
barn
of
reddish-grey
*NL*
brick
and
tile
.
It
was
known
as
the
Brown
House
by
the
people
of
the
*NL*
locality
.
He
was
about
to
pass
it
when
he
perceived
a
ladder
against
*NL*
the
eaves
;
and
the
reflection
that
the
higher
he
got
,
the
further
he
*NL*
could
see
,
led
Jude
to
stand
and
regard
it
.
On
the
slope
of
the
roof
*NL*
two
men
were
repairing
the
tiling
.
He
turned
into
the
ridgeway
and
*NL*
drew
towards
the
barn
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
wistfully
watched
the
workmen
for
some
time
he
took
*NL*
courage
,
and
ascended
the
ladder
till
he
stood
beside
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
lad
,
and
what
may
you
want
up
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wanted
to
know
where
the
city
of
Christminster
is
,
if
you
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Christminster
is
out
across
there
,
by
that
clump
.
You
can
see
*NL*
it
--
at
least
you
can
on
a
clear
day
.
Ah
,
no
,
you
ca
n't
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
tiler
,
glad
of
any
kind
of
diversion
from
the
monotony
of
*NL*
his
labour
,
had
also
turned
to
look
towards
the
quarter
designated
.
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
often
see
it
in
weather
like
this
,
''
he
said
.
``
The
time
*NL*
I
've
noticed
it
is
when
the
sun
is
going
down
in
a
blaze
of
flame
,
*NL*
and
it
looks
like
--
I
do
n't
know
what
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
heavenly
Jerusalem
,
''
suggested
the
serious
urchin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
--
though
I
should
never
ha
'
thought
of
it
myself
...
But
I
ca
n't
*NL*
see
no
Christminster
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
strained
his
eyes
also
;
yet
neither
could
he
see
the
far-off
*NL*
city
.
He
descended
from
the
barn
,
and
abandoning
Christminster
with
*NL*
the
versatility
of
his
age
he
walked
along
the
ridge-track
,
looking
*NL*
for
any
natural
objects
of
interest
that
might
lie
in
the
banks
*NL*
thereabout
.
When
he
repassed
the
barn
to
go
back
to
Marygreen
he
*NL*
observed
that
the
ladder
was
still
in
its
place
,
but
that
the
men
had
*NL*
finished
their
day
's
work
and
gone
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
waning
towards
evening
;
there
was
still
a
faint
mist
,
but
it
*NL*
had
cleared
a
little
except
in
the
damper
tracts
of
subjacent
country
*NL*
and
along
the
river-courses
.
He
thought
again
of
Christminster
,
and
*NL*
wished
,
since
he
had
come
two
or
three
miles
from
his
aunt
's
house
*NL*
on
purpose
,
that
he
could
have
seen
for
once
this
attractive
city
of
*NL*
which
he
had
been
told
.
But
even
if
he
waited
here
it
was
hardly
*NL*
likely
that
the
air
would
clear
before
night
.
Yet
he
was
loth
to
*NL*
leave
the
spot
,
for
the
northern
expanse
became
lost
to
view
on
*NL*
retreating
towards
the
village
only
a
few
hundred
yards
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
ascended
the
ladder
to
have
one
more
look
at
the
point
the
men
*NL*
had
designated
,
and
perched
himself
on
the
highest
rung
,
overlying
*NL*
the
tiles
.
He
might
not
be
able
to
come
so
far
as
this
for
many
*NL*
days
.
Perhaps
if
he
prayed
,
the
wish
to
see
Christminster
might
be
*NL*
forwarded
.
People
said
that
,
if
you
prayed
,
things
sometimes
came
to
*NL*
you
,
even
though
they
sometimes
did
not
.
He
had
read
in
a
tract
that
*NL*
a
man
who
had
begun
to
build
a
church
,
and
had
no
money
to
finish
*NL*
it
,
knelt
down
and
prayed
,
and
the
money
came
in
by
the
next
post
.
*NL*
Another
man
tried
the
same
experiment
,
and
the
money
did
not
come
;
*NL*
but
he
found
afterwards
that
the
breeches
he
knelt
in
were
made
by
*NL*
a
wicked
Jew
.
This
was
not
discouraging
,
and
turning
on
the
ladder
*NL*
Jude
knelt
on
the
third
rung
,
where
,
resting
against
those
above
it
,
*NL*
he
prayed
that
the
mist
might
rise
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
then
seated
himself
again
,
and
waited
.
In
the
course
of
ten
or
*NL*
fifteen
minutes
the
thinning
mist
dissolved
altogether
from
the
*NL*
northern
horizon
,
as
it
had
already
done
elsewhere
,
and
about
a
*NL*
quarter
of
an
hour
before
the
time
of
sunset
the
westward
clouds
*NL*
parted
,
the
sun
's
position
being
partially
uncovered
,
and
the
beams
*NL*
streaming
out
in
visible
lines
between
two
bars
of
slaty
cloud
.
The
*NL*
boy
immediately
looked
back
in
the
old
direction
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
way
within
the
limits
of
the
stretch
of
landscape
,
points
of
*NL*
light
like
the
topaz
gleamed
.
The
air
increased
in
transparency
with
*NL*
the
lapse
of
minutes
,
till
the
topaz
points
showed
themselves
to
be
*NL*
the
vanes
,
windows
,
wet
roof
slates
,
and
other
shining
spots
upon
the
*NL*
spires
,
domes
,
freestone-work
,
and
varied
outlines
that
were
faintly
*NL*
revealed
.
It
was
Christminster
,
unquestionably
;
either
directly
*NL*
seen
,
or
miraged
in
the
peculiar
atmosphere
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
spectator
gazed
on
and
on
till
the
windows
and
vanes
lost
their
*NL*
shine
,
going
out
almost
suddenly
like
extinguished
candles
.
The
*NL*
vague
city
became
veiled
in
mist
.
Turning
to
the
west
,
he
saw
that
*NL*
the
sun
had
disappeared
.
The
foreground
of
the
scene
had
grown
*NL*
funereally
dark
,
and
near
objects
put
on
the
hues
and
shapes
of
*NL*
chimaeras
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
anxiously
descended
the
ladder
,
and
started
homewards
at
a
run
,
*NL*
trying
not
to
think
of
giants
,
Herne
the
Hunter
,
Apollyon
lying
in
*NL*
wait
for
Christian
,
or
of
the
captain
with
the
bleeding
hole
in
his
*NL*
forehead
and
the
corpses
round
him
that
remutinied
every
night
on
*NL*
board
the
bewitched
ship
.
He
knew
that
he
had
grown
out
of
belief
in
*NL*
these
horrors
,
yet
he
was
glad
when
he
saw
the
church
tower
and
the
*NL*
lights
in
the
cottage
windows
,
even
though
this
was
not
the
home
of
*NL*
his
birth
,
and
his
great-aunt
did
not
care
much
about
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Inside
and
round
about
that
old
woman
's
``
shop
''
window
,
with
its
*NL*
twenty-four
little
panes
set
in
lead-work
,
the
glass
of
some
of
*NL*
them
oxidized
with
age
,
so
that
you
could
hardly
see
the
poor
penny
*NL*
articles
exhibited
within
,
and
forming
part
of
a
stock
which
a
strong
*NL*
man
could
have
carried
,
Jude
had
his
outer
being
for
some
long
*NL*
tideless
time
.
But
his
dreams
were
as
gigantic
as
his
surroundings
*NL*
were
small
.
*NL*
*NL*
Through
the
solid
barrier
of
cold
cretaceous
upland
to
the
northward
*NL*
he
was
always
beholding
a
gorgeous
city
--
the
fancied
place
he
had
*NL*
likened
to
the
new
Jerusalem
,
though
there
was
perhaps
more
of
the
*NL*
painter
's
imagination
and
less
of
the
diamond
merchant
's
in
his
*NL*
dreams
thereof
than
in
those
of
the
Apocalyptic
writer
.
And
the
city
*NL*
acquired
a
tangibility
,
a
permanence
,
a
hold
on
his
life
,
mainly
from
*NL*
the
one
nucleus
of
fact
that
the
man
for
whose
knowledge
and
purposes
*NL*
he
had
so
much
reverence
was
actually
living
there
;
not
only
so
,
but
*NL*
living
among
the
more
thoughtful
and
mentally
shining
ones
therein
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
sad
wet
seasons
,
though
he
knew
it
must
rain
at
Christminster
too
,
*NL*
he
could
hardly
believe
that
it
rained
so
drearily
there
.
Whenever
*NL*
he
could
get
away
from
the
confines
of
the
hamlet
for
an
hour
or
two
,
*NL*
which
was
not
often
,
he
would
steal
off
to
the
Brown
House
on
the
*NL*
hill
and
strain
his
eyes
persistently
;
sometimes
to
be
rewarded
by
*NL*
the
sight
of
a
dome
or
spire
,
at
other
times
by
a
little
smoke
,
which
*NL*
in
his
estimate
had
some
of
the
mysticism
of
incense
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
day
came
when
it
suddenly
occurred
to
him
that
if
he
*NL*
ascended
to
the
point
of
view
after
dark
,
or
possibly
went
a
mile
or
*NL*
two
further
,
he
would
see
the
night
lights
of
the
city
.
It
would
be
*NL*
necessary
to
come
back
alone
,
but
even
that
consideration
did
not
*NL*
deter
him
,
for
he
could
throw
a
little
manliness
into
his
mood
,
no
*NL*
doubt
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
project
was
duly
executed
.
It
was
not
late
when
he
arrived
at
*NL*
the
place
of
outlook
,
only
just
after
dusk
,
but
a
black
north-east
*NL*
sky
,
accompanied
by
a
wind
from
the
same
quarter
,
made
the
occasion
*NL*
dark
enough
.
He
was
rewarded
;
but
what
he
saw
was
not
the
lamps
in
*NL*
rows
,
as
he
had
half
expected
.
No
individual
light
was
visible
,
only
*NL*
a
halo
or
glow-fog
over-arching
the
place
against
the
black
heavens
*NL*
behind
it
,
making
the
light
and
the
city
seem
distant
but
a
mile
or
*NL*
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
set
himself
to
wonder
on
the
exact
point
in
the
glow
where
the
*NL*
schoolmaster
might
be
--
he
who
never
communicated
with
anybody
at
*NL*
Marygreen
now
;
who
was
as
if
dead
to
them
here
.
In
the
glow
he
*NL*
seemed
to
see
Phillotson
promenading
at
ease
,
like
one
of
the
forms
*NL*
in
Nebuchadnezzar
's
furnace
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
heard
that
breezes
travelled
at
the
rate
of
ten
miles
an
hour
,
*NL*
and
the
fact
now
came
into
his
mind
.
He
parted
his
lips
as
he
faced
*NL*
the
north-east
,
and
drew
in
the
wind
as
if
it
were
a
sweet
liquor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
,
''
he
said
,
addressing
the
breeze
caressingly
``
were
in
*NL*
Christminster
city
between
one
and
two
hours
ago
,
floating
along
the
*NL*
streets
,
pulling
round
the
weather-cocks
,
touching
Mr.
Phillotson
's
*NL*
face
,
being
breathed
by
him
;
and
now
you
are
here
,
breathed
by
*NL*
me
--
you
,
the
very
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
there
came
along
this
wind
something
towards
him
--
a
message
*NL*
from
the
place
--
from
some
soul
residing
there
,
it
seemed
.
Surely
it
*NL*
was
the
sound
of
bells
,
the
voice
of
the
city
,
faint
and
musical
,
*NL*
calling
to
him
,
``
We
are
happy
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
become
entirely
lost
to
his
bodily
situation
during
this
*NL*
mental
leap
,
and
only
got
back
to
it
by
a
rough
recalling
.
A
few
*NL*
yards
below
the
brow
of
the
hill
on
which
he
paused
a
team
of
horses
*NL*
made
its
appearance
,
having
reached
the
place
by
dint
of
half
an
*NL*
hour
's
serpentine
progress
from
the
bottom
of
the
immense
declivity
.
*NL*
They
had
a
load
of
coals
behind
them
--
a
fuel
that
could
only
be
got
*NL*
into
the
upland
by
this
particular
route
.
They
were
accompanied
by
a
*NL*
carter
,
a
second
man
,
and
a
boy
,
who
now
kicked
a
large
stone
behind
*NL*
one
of
the
wheels
,
and
allowed
the
panting
animals
to
have
a
long
*NL*
rest
,
while
those
in
charge
took
a
flagon
off
the
load
and
indulged
*NL*
in
a
drink
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
elderly
men
,
and
had
genial
voices
.
Jude
addressed
them
,
*NL*
inquiring
if
they
had
come
from
Christminster
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heaven
forbid
,
with
this
load
!
''
said
they
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
place
I
mean
is
that
one
yonder
.
''
He
was
getting
so
*NL*
romantically
attached
to
Christminster
that
,
like
a
young
lover
*NL*
alluding
to
his
mistress
,
he
felt
bashful
at
mentioning
its
name
*NL*
again
.
He
pointed
to
the
light
in
the
sky
--
hardly
perceptible
to
*NL*
their
older
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
There
do
seem
a
spot
a
bit
brighter
in
the
nor
'
-
east
than
*NL*
elsewhere
,
though
I
should
n't
ha

noticed
it
myself
,
and
no
doubt
it
*NL*
med
be
Christminster

''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
a
little
book
of
tales
which
Jude
had
tucked
up
under
his
arm
,
*NL*
having
brought
them
to
read
on
his
way
hither
before
it
grew
dark
,
*NL*
slipped
and
fell
into
the
road
.
The
carter
eyed
him
while
he
picked
*NL*
it
up
and
straightened
the
leaves
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
young
man
,
''
he
observed
,
``
you
'd
have
to
get
your
head
screwed
on
*NL*
t
`
other
way
before
you
could
read
what
they
read
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
asked
the
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
they
never
look
at
anything
that
folks
like
we
can
understand
,
''
*NL*
the
carter
continued
,
by
way
of
passing
the
time
.
``
On
'
y
foreign
*NL*
tongues
used
in
the
days
of
the
Tower
of
Babel
,
when
no
two
families
*NL*
spoke
alike
.
They
read
that
sort
of
thing
as
fast
as
a
night-hawk
*NL*
will
whir
.
'T
is
all
learning
there
--
nothing
but
learning
,
except
*NL*
religion

And
that
's
learning
too
,

I
never
could
understand
it

*NL*
Yes

't
is

serious-minded
place

Not

there
's

in

You
know

I
suppose
,
that
they
raise
pa

they
'll
do

and
a
religious

collar

hat

as
they
used
to
wear
in
the
Scriptures
,
so
that
*NL*
his
own
mother
would
n't
know
un
sometimes

There
,
't
is
their
*NL*
business

like
anybody

there

By
this
time
the
horses
had
recovered
breath
and
bent
to
their
*NL*
collars
again
.
Jude
,
throwing
a
last
adoring
look
at
the
distant
*NL*
halo
,
turned
and
walked
beside
his
remarkably
well-informed
friend
,
*NL*
who
had
no
objection
to
telling
him
as
they
moved
on
more
yet
of
*NL*
the
city
--
its
towers
and
halls
and
churches
.
The
waggon
turned
*NL*
into
a
cross-road
,
whereupon
Jude
thanked
the
carter
warmly
for
his
*NL*
information
,
and
said
he
only
wished
he
could
talk
half
as
well
about
*NL*
Christminster
as
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
't
is
oonly
what
has
come
in
my
way

''
said
the
carter
*NL*
unboastfully
.
``
I
've
never
been
there

no
more
than
you

I

picked
up

there

A-getting
about

clane
the

''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
continued
his
walk
homeward
alone
,
pondering
so
deeply
that
*NL*
he
forgot
to
feel
timid
.
He
suddenly
grew
older
.
It
had
been
the
*NL*
yearning
of
his
heart
to
find
something
to
anchor
on
,
to
cling
*NL*
to
--
for
some
place
which
he
could
call
admirable
.
Should
he
find
*NL*
that
place
in
this
city
if
he
could
get
there
?
Would
it
be
a
spot
in
*NL*
which
,
without
fear
of
farmers
,
or
hindrance
,
or
ridicule
,
he
could
*NL*
watch
and
wait
,
and
set
himself
to
some
mighty
undertaking
like
the
*NL*
men
of
old
of
whom
he
had
heard
?
As
the
halo
had
been
to
his
eyes
*NL*
when
gazing
at
it
a
quarter
of
an
hour
earlier
,
so
was
the
spot
*NL*
mentally
to
him
as
he
pursued
his
dark
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
city
of
light
,
''
he
said
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
tree
of
knowledge
grows
there
,
''
he
added
a
few
steps
further
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
place
that
teachers
of

spring
from

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
what
you
may
call
a
castle
,
manned
by
scholarship
and
*NL*
religion

''
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
figure
he
was
silent
a
long
while
,
till
he
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
just
suit
me

*NL*
*NL*
Walking
somewhat
slowly
by
reason
of
his
concentration
,
the
boy
--
an
*NL*
ancient
man
in
some
phases
of
thought
,
much
younger
than
his
years
*NL*
in
others
--
was
overtaken
by
a
light-footed
pedestrian
,
whom
,
*NL*
notwithstanding
the
gloom
,
he
could
perceive
to
be
wearing
an
*NL*
extraordinarily
tall
hat
,
a
swallow-tailed
coat
,
and
a
watch-chain
*NL*
that
danced
madly
and
threw
around
scintillations
of
sky-light
as
*NL*
its
owner
swung
along
upon
a
pair
of
thin
legs
and
noiseless
boots
.
*NL*
Jude
,
beginning
to
feel
lonely
,
endeavoured
to
keep
up
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
man
!
I
'm
in
a
hurry
,
so
you
'll
have
to
walk
pretty
fast

you
keep
alongside

Do
you
know

am

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

I
think

Physician
Vilbert
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
--
I
'm
known
everywhere
,
I
see
!
That
comes
of
being
a
public
*NL*
benefactor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Vilbert
was
an
itinerant
quack-doctor
,
well
known
to
the
rustic
*NL*
population
,
and
absolutely
unknown
to
anybody
else
,
as
he
,
indeed
,
*NL*
took
care
to
be
,
to
avoid
inconvenient
investigations
.
Cottagers
*NL*
formed
his
only
patients
,
and
his
Wessex-wide
repute
was
among
them
*NL*
alone
.
His
position
was
humbler
and
his
field
more
obscure
than
*NL*
those
of
the
quacks
with
capital
and
an
organized
system
of
*NL*
advertising
.
He
was
,
in
fact
,
a
survival
.
The
distances
he
*NL*
traversed
on
foot
were
enormous
,
and
extended
nearly
the
whole
length
*NL*
and
breadth
of
Wessex
.
Jude
had
one
day
seen
him
selling
a
pot
of
*NL*
coloured
lard
to
an
old
woman
as
a
certain
cure
for
a
bad
leg
,
the
*NL*
woman
arranging
to
pay
a
guinea
,
in
instalments
of
a
shilling
a
*NL*
fortnight
,
for
the
precious
salve
,
which
,
according
to
the
physician
,
*NL*
could
only
be
obtained
from
a
particular
animal
which
grazed
on
*NL*
Mount
Sinai
,
and
was
to
be
captured
only
at
great
risk
to
life
and
*NL*
limb
.
Jude
,
though
he
already
had
his
doubts
about
this
gentleman
's
*NL*
medicines
,
felt
him
to
be
unquestionably
a
travelled
personage
,
and
*NL*
one
who
might
be
a
trustworthy
source
of
information
on
matters
not
*NL*
strictly
professional
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
s
`
pose

've
been
to
Christminster

*NL*
*NL*
``

the
long
thin
man
.
``

*NL*
``

gratefully

but
in
gasps

for

amazing
speed

physician

walk
kept
him

``

Jude
then
dropped
behind
,
waited
a
few
minutes
to
recover
breath
,
*NL*
and
went
home
with
a
consciousness
of
having
struck
a
blow
for
*NL*
Christminster
.
*NL*
*NL*
Through
the
intervening
fortnight
he
ran
about
and
smiled
outwardly
*NL*
at
his
inward
thoughts
,
as
if
they
were
people
meeting
and
nodding
to
*NL*
him
--
smiled
with
that
singularly
beautiful
irradiation
which
is
seen
*NL*
to
spread
on
young
faces
at
the
inception
of
some
glorious
idea
,
as
*NL*
if
a
supernatural
lamp
were
held
inside
their
transparent
natures
,
*NL*
giving
rise
to
the
flattering
fancy
that
heaven
lies
about
them
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
honestly
performed
his
promise
to
the
man
of
many
cures
,
in
whom
*NL*
he
now
sincerely
believed
,
walking
miles
hither
and
thither
among
*NL*
the
surrounding
hamlets
as
the
Physician
's
agent
in
advance
.
On
the
*NL*
evening
appointed
he
stood
motionless
on
the
plateau
,
at
the
place
*NL*
where
he
had
parted
from
Vilbert
,
and
there
awaited
his
approach
.
*NL*
The
road-physician
was
fairly
up
to
time
;
but
,
to
the
surprise
of
*NL*
Jude
on
striking
into
his
pace
,
which
the
pedestrian
did
not
diminish
*NL*
by
a
single
unit
of
force
,
the
latter
seemed
hardly
to
recognize
his
*NL*
young
companion
,
though
with
the
lapse
of
the
fortnight
the
evenings
*NL*
had
grown
light
.
Jude
thought
it
might
perhaps
be
owing
to
his
*NL*
wearing
another
hat
,
and
he
saluted
the
physician
with
dignity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
boy
?
''
said
the
latter
abstractedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
come
,
''
said
Jude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
?
who
are
you
?
Oh
yes

to
be
sure
!
Got
any
orders

lad
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

''
And
Jude
told
him
the
names
and
addresses
of
the
cottagers
*NL*
who
were
willing
to
test
the
virtues
of
the
world-renowned
pills
and
*NL*
salve
.
The
quack
mentally
registered
these
with
great
care
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
Latin
and
Greek
grammars
?
''
Jude
's
voice
trembled
with
*NL*
anxiety
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
about
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
to
bring
me
yours
,
that
you
used
before
you
took
your
*NL*
degree
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
yes
,
yes
!
Forgot
all
about
it
--
all
!
So
many
lives
depending
on
*NL*
my
attention
,
you
see
,
my
man
,
that
I
ca
n't
give
so
much
thought
as
I
*NL*
would
like
to
other
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
controlled
himself
sufficiently
long
to
make
sure
of
the
truth
;
*NL*
and
he
repeated
,
in
a
voice
of
dry
misery
,
``
You
have
n't
brought
'em
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
But
you
must
get
me
some
more
orders
from
sick
people
,
and
I
'll
*NL*
bring
the
grammars
next
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
dropped
behind
.
He
was
an
unsophisticated
boy
,
but
the
gift
of
*NL*
sudden
insight
which
is
sometimes
vouchsafed
to
children
showed
him
*NL*
all
at
once
what
shoddy
humanity
the
quack
was
made
of
.
There
was
to
*NL*
be
no
intellectual
light
from
this
source
.
The
leaves
dropped
from
*NL*
his
imaginary
crown
of
laurel
;
he
turned
to
a
gate
,
leant
against
it
,
*NL*
and
cried
bitterly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
disappointment
was
followed
by
an
interval
of
blankness
.
He
*NL*
might
,
perhaps
,
have
obtained
grammars
from
Alfredston
,
but
to
do
*NL*
that
required
money
,
and
a
knowledge
of
what
books
to
order
;
and
*NL*
though
physically
comfortable
,
he
was
in
such
absolute
dependence
as
*NL*
to
be
without
a
farthing
of
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
date
Mr.
Phillotson
sent
for
his
pianoforte
,
and
it
gave
Jude
*NL*
a
lead
.
Why
should
he
not
write
to
the
schoolmaster
,
and
ask
him
to
*NL*
be
so
kind
as
to
get
him
the
grammars
in
Christminster
?
He
might
*NL*
slip
a
letter
inside
the
case
of
the
instrument
,
and
it
would
be
*NL*
sure
to
reach
the
desired
eyes
.
Why
not
ask
him
to
send
any
old
*NL*
second-hand
copies
,
which
would
have
the
charm
of
being
mellowed
by
*NL*
the
university
atmosphere
?
*NL*
*NL*
To
tell
his
aunt
of
his
intention
would
be
to
defeat
it
.
It
was
*NL*
necessary
to
act
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
further
consideration
of
a
few
days
he
did
act
,
and
on
the
*NL*
day
of
the
piano
's
departure
,
which
happened
to
be
his
next
birthday
,
*NL*
clandestinely
placed
the
letter
inside
the
packing-case
,
directed
to
*NL*
his
much-admired
friend
,
being
afraid
to
reveal
the
operation
to
his
*NL*
aunt
Drusilla
,
lest
she
should
discover
his
motive
,
and
compel
him
to
*NL*
abandon
his
scheme
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
piano
was
despatched
,
and
Jude
waited
days
and
weeks
,
calling
*NL*
every
morning
at
the
cottage
post
office
before
his
great-aunt
was
*NL*
stirring
.
At
last
a
packet
did
indeed
arrive
at
the
village
,
and
he
*NL*
saw
from
the
ends
of
it
that
it
contained
two
thin
books
.
He
took
it
*NL*
away
into
a
lonely
place
,
and
sat
down
on
a
felled
elm
to
open
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ever
since
his
first
ecstasy
or
vision
of
Christminster
and
its
*NL*
possibilities
,
Jude
had
meditated
much
and
curiously
on
the
probable
*NL*
sort
of
process
that
was
involved
in
turning
the
expressions
of
one
*NL*
language
into
those
of
another
.
He
concluded
that
a
grammar
of
the
*NL*
required
tongue
would
contain
,
primarily
,
a
rule
,
prescription
,
or
*NL*
clue
of
the
nature
of
a
secret
cipher
,
which
,
once
known
,
would
*NL*
enable
him
,
by
merely
applying
it
,
to
change
at
will
all
words
of
his
*NL*
own
speech
into
those
of
the
foreign
one
.
His
childish
idea
was
,
in
*NL*
fact
,
a
pushing
to
the
extremity
of
mathematical
precision
what
is
*NL*
everywhere
known
as
Grimm
's
Law
--
an
aggrandizement
of
rough
rules
to
*NL*
ideal
completeness
.
Thus
he
assumed
that
the
words
of
the
required
*NL*
language
were
always
to
be
found
somewhere
latent
in
the
words
of
the
*NL*
given
language
by
those
who
had
the
art
to
uncover
them
,
such
art
*NL*
being
furnished
by
the
books
aforesaid
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
,
therefore
,
having
noted
that
the
packet
bore
the
postmark
of
*NL*
Christminster
,
he
cut
the
string
,
opened
the
volumes
,
and
turned
to
*NL*
the
Latin
grammar
,
which
chanced
to
come
uppermost
,
he
could
scarcely
*NL*
believe
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
book
was
an
old
one
--
thirty
years
old
,
soiled
,
scribbled
*NL*
wantonly
over
with
a
strange
name
in
every
variety
of
enmity
to
the
*NL*
letterpress
,
and
marked
at
random
with
dates
twenty
years
earlier
*NL*
than
his
own
day
.
But
this
was
not
the
cause
of
Jude
's
amazement
.
*NL*
He
learnt
for
the
first
time
that
there
was
no
law
of
transmutation
,
*NL*
as
in
his
innocence
he
had
supposed
-LRB-
there
was
,
in
some
degree
,
but
*NL*
the
grammarian
did
not
recognize
it
-RRB-
,
but
that
every
word
in
both
*NL*
Latin
and
Greek
was
to
be
individually
committed
to
memory
at
the
*NL*
cost
of
years
of
plodding
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
flung
down
the
books
,
lay
backward
along
the
broad
trunk
of
the
*NL*
elm
,
and
was
an
utterly
miserable
boy
for
the
space
of
a
quarter
of
*NL*
an
hour
.
As
he
had
often
done
before
,
he
pulled
his
hat
over
his
*NL*
face
and
watched
the
sun
peering
insidiously
at
him
through
the
*NL*
interstices
of
the
straw
.
This
was
Latin
and
Greek
,
then
,
was
it
*NL*
this
grand
delusion
!
The
charm
he
had
supposed
in
store
for
him
was
*NL*
really
a
labour
like
that
of
Israel
in
Egypt
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
brains
they
must
have
in
Christminster
and
the
great
schools
,
he
*NL*
presently
thought
,
to
learn
words
one
by
one
up
to
tens
of
thousands
!
*NL*
There
were
no
brains
in
his
head
equal
to
this
business
;
and
as
the
*NL*
little
sun-rays
continued
to
stream
in
through
his
hat
at
him
,
he
*NL*
wished
he
had
never
seen
a
book
,
that
he
might
never
see
another
,
*NL*
that
he
had
never
been
born
.
*NL*
*NL*
Somebody
might
have
come
along
that
way
who
would
have
asked
him
his
*NL*
trouble
,
and
might
have
cheered
him
by
saying
that
his
notions
were
*NL*
further
advanced
than
those
of
his
grammarian
.
But
nobody
did
come
,
*NL*
because
nobody
does
;
and
under
the
crushing
recognition
of
his
*NL*
gigantic
error
Jude
continued
to
wish
himself
out
of
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
V
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
three
or
four
succeeding
years
a
quaint
and
singular
*NL*
vehicle
might
have
been
discerned
moving
along
the
lanes
and
by-roads
*NL*
near
Marygreen
,
driven
in
a
quaint
and
singular
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
course
of
a
month
or
two
after
the
receipt
of
the
books
*NL*
Jude
had
grown
callous
to
the
shabby
trick
played
him
by
the
dead
*NL*
languages
.
In
fact
,
his
disappointment
at
the
nature
of
those
*NL*
tongues
had
,
after
a
while
,
been
the
means
of
still
further
*NL*
glorifying
the
erudition
of
Christminster
.
To
acquire
languages
,
*NL*
departed
or
living
in
spite
of
such
obstinacies
as
he
now
knew
them
*NL*
inherently
to
possess
,
was
a
herculean
performance
which
gradually
*NL*
led
him
on
to
a
greater
interest
in
it
than
in
the
presupposed
patent
*NL*
process
.
The
mountain-weight
of
material
under
which
the
ideas
lay
*NL*
in
those
dusty
volumes
called
the
classics
piqued
him
into
a
dogged
,
*NL*
mouselike
subtlety
of
attempt
to
move
it
piecemeal
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
endeavoured
to
make
his
presence
tolerable
to
his
crusty
*NL*
maiden
aunt
by
assisting
her
to
the
best
of
his
ability
,
and
the
*NL*
business
of
the
little
cottage
bakery
had
grown
in
consequence
.
An
*NL*
aged
horse
with
a
hanging
head
had
been
purchased
for
eight
pounds
at
*NL*
a
sale
,
a
creaking
cart
with
a
whity-brown
tilt
obtained
for
a
few
*NL*
pounds
more
,
and
in
this
turn-out
it
became
Jude
's
business
thrice
a
*NL*
week
to
carry
loaves
of
bread
to
the
villagers
and
solitary
cotters
*NL*
immediately
round
Marygreen
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
singularity
aforesaid
lay
,
after
all
,
less
in
the
conveyance
*NL*
itself
than
in
Jude
's
manner
of
conducting
it
along
its
route
.
*NL*
Its
interior
was
the
scene
of
most
of
Jude
's
education
by
``
private
*NL*
study
.
''
As
soon
as
the
horse
had
learnt
the
road
and
the
houses
*NL*
at
which
he
was
to
pause
awhile
,
the
boy
,
seated
in
front
,
would
*NL*
slip
the
reins
over
his
arm
,
ingeniously
fix
open
,
by
means
of
a
*NL*
strap
attached
to
the
tilt
,
the
volume
he
was
reading
,
spread
the
*NL*
dictionary
on
his
knees
,
and
plunge
into
the
simpler
passages
from
*NL*
Caesar
,
Virgil
,
or
Horace
,
as
the
case
might
be
,
in
his
purblind
*NL*
stumbling
way
,
and
with
an
expenditure
of
labour
that
would
have
made
*NL*
a
tender-hearted
pedagogue
shed
tears
;
yet
somehow
getting
at
the
*NL*
meaning
of
what
he
read
,
and
divining
rather
than
beholding
the
*NL*
spirit
of
the
original
,
which
often
to
his
mind
was
something
else
*NL*
than
that
which
he
was
taught
to
look
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
only
copies
he
had
been
able
to
lay
hands
on
were
old
Delphin
*NL*
editions
,
because
they
were
superseded
,
and
therefore
cheap
.
But
,
*NL*
bad
for
idle
schoolboys
,
it
did
so
happen
that
they
were
passably
*NL*
good
for
him
.
The
hampered
and
lonely
itinerant
conscientiously
*NL*
covered
up
the
marginal
readings
,
and
used
them
merely
on
points
of
*NL*
construction
,
as
he
would
have
used
a
comrade
or
tutor
who
should
*NL*
have
happened
to
be
passing
by
.
And
though
Jude
may
have
had
little
*NL*
chance
of
becoming
a
scholar
by
these
rough
and
ready
means
,
he
was
*NL*
in
the
way
of
getting
into
the
groove
he
wished
to
follow
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
he
was
busied
with
these
ancient
pages
,
which
had
already
been
*NL*
thumbed
by
hands
possibly
in
the
grave
,
digging
out
the
thoughts
*NL*
of
these
minds
so
remote
yet
so
near
,
the
bony
old
horse
pursued
*NL*
his
rounds
,
and
Jude
would
be
aroused
from
the
woes
of
Dido
by
the
*NL*
stoppage
of
his
cart
and
the
voice
of
some
old
woman
crying
,
``
Two
*NL*
to-day
,
baker
,
and
I
return
this
stale
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
frequently
met
in
the
lanes
by
pedestrians
and
others
without
*NL*
his
seeing
them
,
and
by
degrees
the
people
of
the
neighbourhood
*NL*
began
to
talk
about
his
method
of
combining
work
and
play
-LRB-
such
they
*NL*
considered
his
reading
to
be
-RRB-
,
which
,
though
probably
convenient
*NL*
enough
to
himself
,
was
not
altogether
a
safe
proceeding
for
other
*NL*
travellers
along
the
same
roads
.
There
were
murmurs
.
Then
a
private
*NL*
resident
of
an
adjoining
place
informed
the
local
policeman
that
the
*NL*
baker
's
boy
should
not
be
allowed
to
read
while
driving
,
and
insisted
*NL*
that
it
was
the
constable
's
duty
to
catch
him
in
the
act
,
and
*NL*
take
him
to
the
police
court
at
Alfredston
,
and
get
him
fined
for
*NL*
dangerous
practices
on
the
highway
.
The
policeman
thereupon
lay
in
*NL*
wait
for
Jude
,
and
one
day
accosted
him
and
cautioned
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Jude
had
to
get
up
at
three
o'clock
in
the
morning
to
heat
the
*NL*
oven
,
and
mix
and
set
in
the
bread
that
he
distributed
later
in
the
*NL*
day
,
he
was
obliged
to
go
to
bed
at
night
immediately
after
laying
*NL*
the
sponge
;
so
that
if
he
could
not
read
his
classics
on
the
highways
*NL*
he
could
hardly
study
at
all
.
The
only
thing
to
be
done
was
,
*NL*
therefore
,
to
keep
a
sharp
eye
ahead
and
around
him
as
well
as
he
*NL*
could
in
the
circumstances
,
and
slip
away
his
books
as
soon
as
*NL*
anybody
loomed
in
the
distance
,
the
policeman
in
particular
.
To
do
*NL*
that
official
justice
,
he
did
not
put
himself
much
in
the
way
of
*NL*
Jude
's
bread-cart
,
considering
that
in
such
a
lonely
district
the
*NL*
chief
danger
was
to
Jude
himself
,
and
often
on
seeing
the
white
tilt
*NL*
over
the
hedges
he
would
move
in
another
direction
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
a
day
when
Fawley
was
getting
quite
advanced
,
being
now
about
*NL*
sixteen
,
and
had
been
stumbling
through
the
``
Carmen
Saeculare
,
''
on
*NL*
his
way
home
,
he
found
himself
to
be
passing
over
the
high
edge
of
*NL*
the
plateau
by
the
Brown
House
.
The
light
had
changed
,
and
it
was
*NL*
the
sense
of
this
which
had
caused
him
to
look
up
.
The
sun
was
going
*NL*
down
,
and
the
full
moon
was
rising
simultaneously
behind
the
woods
in
*NL*
the
opposite
quarter
.
His
mind
had
become
so
impregnated
with
the
*NL*
poem
that
,
in
a
moment
of
the
same
impulsive
emotion
which
years
*NL*
before
had
caused
him
to
kneel
on
the
ladder
,
he
stopped
the
horse
,
*NL*
alighted
,
and
glancing
round
to
see
that
nobody
was
in
sight
,
knelt
*NL*
down
on
the
roadside
bank
with
open
book
.
He
turned
first
to
the
*NL*
shiny
goddess
,
who
seemed
to
look
so
softly
and
critically
at
his
*NL*
doings
,
then
to
the
disappearing
luminary
on
the
other
hand
,
as
he
*NL*
began
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Phoebe
silvarumque
potens
Diana
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
horse
stood
still
till
he
had
finished
the
hymn
,
which
Jude
*NL*
repeated
under
the
sway
of
a
polytheistic
fancy
that
he
would
never
*NL*
have
thought
of
humouring
in
broad
daylight
.
*NL*
*NL*
Reaching
home
,
he
mused
over
his
curious
superstition
,
innate
or
*NL*
acquired
,
in
doing
this
,
and
the
strange
forgetfulness
which
had
led
*NL*
to
such
a
lapse
from
common
sense
and
custom
in
one
who
wished
,
next
*NL*
to
being
a
scholar
,
to
be
a
Christian
divine
.
It
had
all
come
of
*NL*
reading
heathen
works
exclusively
.
The
more
he
thought
of
it
the
*NL*
more
convinced
he
was
of
his
inconsistency
.
He
began
to
wonder
*NL*
whether
he
could
be
reading
quite
the
right
books
for
his
object
*NL*
in
life
.
Certainly
there
seemed
little
harmony
between
this
pagan
*NL*
literature
and
the
mediaeval
colleges
at
Christminster
,
that
*NL*
ecclesiastical
romance
in
stone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ultimately
he
decided
that
in
his
sheer
love
of
reading
he
had
taken
*NL*
up
a
wrong
emotion
for
a
Christian
young
man
.
He
had
dabbled
in
*NL*
Clarke
's
Homer
,
but
had
never
yet
worked
much
at
the
New
Testament
*NL*
in
the
Greek
,
though
he
possessed
a
copy
,
obtained
by
post
from
a
*NL*
second-hand
bookseller
.
He
abandoned
the
now
familiar
Ionic
for
a
*NL*
new
dialect
,
and
for
a
long
time
onward
limited
his
reading
almost
*NL*
entirely
to
the
Gospels
and
Epistles
in
Griesbach
's
text
.
Moreover
,
*NL*
on
going
into
Alfredston
one
day
,
he
was
introduced
to
patristic
*NL*
literature
by
finding
at
the
bookseller
's
some
volumes
of
the
*NL*
Fathers
which
had
been
left
behind
by
an
insolvent
clergyman
of
the
*NL*
neighbourhood
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
another
outcome
of
this
change
of
groove
he
visited
on
Sundays
all
*NL*
the
churches
within
a
walk
,
and
deciphered
the
Latin
inscriptions
on
*NL*
fifteenth-century
brasses
and
tombs
.
On
one
of
these
pilgrimages
he
*NL*
met
with
a
hunch-backed
old
woman
of
great
intelligence
,
who
read
*NL*
everything
she
could
lay
her
hands
on
,
and
she
told
him
more
yet
*NL*
of
the
romantic
charms
of
the
city
of
light
and
lore
.
Thither
he
*NL*
resolved
as
firmly
as
ever
to
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
how
live
in
that
city
?
At
present
he
had
no
income
at
all
.
He
*NL*
had
no
trade
or
calling
of
any
dignity
or
stability
whatever
on
which
*NL*
he
could
subsist
while
carrying
out
an
intellectual
labour
which
*NL*
might
spread
over
many
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
most
required
by
citizens
?
Food
,
clothing
,
and
shelter
.
*NL*
An
income
from
any
work
in
preparing
the
first
would
be
too
meagre
;
*NL*
for
making
the
second
he
felt
a
distaste
;
the
preparation
of
the
*NL*
third
requisite
he
inclined
to
.
They
built
in
a
city
;
therefore
he
*NL*
would
learn
to
build
.
He
thought
of
his
unknown
uncle
,
his
cousin
*NL*
Susanna
's
father
,
an
ecclesiastical
worker
in
metal
,
and
somehow
*NL*
mediaeval
art
in
any
material
was
a
trade
for
which
he
had
rather
a
*NL*
fancy
.
He
could
not
go
far
wrong
in
following
his
uncle
's
footsteps
,
*NL*
and
engaging
himself
awhile
with
the
carcases
that
contained
the
*NL*
scholar
souls
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
a
preliminary
he
obtained
some
small
blocks
of
freestone
,
metal
*NL*
not
being
available
,
and
suspending
his
studies
awhile
,
occupied
his
*NL*
spare
half-hours
in
copying
the
heads
and
capitals
in
his
parish
*NL*
church
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
stone-mason
of
a
humble
kind
in
Alfredston
,
and
as
*NL*
soon
as
he
had
found
a
substitute
for
himself
in
his
aunt
's
little
*NL*
business
,
he
offered
his
services
to
this
man
for
a
trifling
wage
.
*NL*
Here
Jude
had
the
opportunity
of
learning
at
least
the
rudiments
of
*NL*
freestone-working
.
Some
time
later
he
went
to
a
church-builder
in
*NL*
the
same
place
,
and
under
the
architect
's
direction
became
handy
at
*NL*
restoring
the
dilapidated
masonries
of
several
village
churches
round
*NL*
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
forgetting
that
he
was
only
following
up
this
handicraft
as
*NL*
a
prop
to
lean
on
while
he
prepared
those
greater
engines
which
*NL*
he
flattered
himself
would
be
better
fitted
for
him
,
he
yet
was
*NL*
interested
in
his
pursuit
on
its
own
account
.
He
now
had
lodgings
*NL*
during
the
week
in
the
little
town
,
whence
he
returned
to
Marygreen
*NL*
village
every
Saturday
evening
.
And
thus
he
reached
and
passed
his
*NL*
nineteenth
year
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
VI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
memorable
date
of
his
life
he
was
,
one
Saturday
,
returning
*NL*
from
Alfredston
to
Marygreen
about
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
.
*NL*
It
was
fine
,
warm
,
and
soft
summer
weather
,
and
he
walked
with
his
*NL*
tools
at
his
back
,
his
little
chisels
clinking
faintly
against
the
*NL*
larger
ones
in
his
basket
.
It
being
the
end
of
the
week
he
had
left
*NL*
work
early
,
and
had
come
out
of
the
town
by
a
round-about
route
which
*NL*
he
did
not
usually
frequent
,
having
promised
to
call
at
a
flour-mill
*NL*
near
Cresscombe
to
execute
a
commission
for
his
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
in
an
enthusiastic
mood
.
He
seemed
to
see
his
way
to
living
*NL*
comfortably
in
Christminster
in
the
course
of
a
year
or
two
,
and
*NL*
knocking
at
the
doors
of
one
of
those
strongholds
of
learning
of
*NL*
which
he
had
dreamed
so
much
.
He
might
,
of
course
,
have
gone
there
*NL*
now
,
in
some
capacity
or
other
,
but
he
preferred
to
enter
the
city
*NL*
with
a
little
more
assurance
as
to
means
than
he
could
be
said
to
*NL*
feel
at
present
.
A
warm
self-content
suffused
him
when
he
considered
*NL*
what
he
had
already
done
.
Now
and
then
as
he
went
along
he
turned
*NL*
to
face
the
peeps
of
country
on
either
side
of
him
.
But
he
hardly
*NL*
saw
them
;
the
act
was
an
automatic
repetition
of
what
he
had
been
*NL*
accustomed
to
do
when
less
occupied
;
and
the
one
matter
which
really
*NL*
engaged
him
was
the
mental
estimate
of
his
progress
thus
far
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
acquired
quite
an
average
student
's
power
to
read
the
*NL*
common
ancient
classics
,
Latin
in
particular
.
''
This
was
true
,
*NL*
Jude
possessing
a
facility
in
that
language
which
enabled
him
with
*NL*
great
ease
to
himself
to
beguile
his
lonely
walks
by
imaginary
*NL*
conversations
therein
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
read
two
books
of
the
_
Iliad
_
,
besides
being
pretty
familiar
*NL*
with
passages
such
as
the
speech
of
Phoenix
in
the
ninth
book
,
*NL*
the
fight
of
Hector
and
Ajax
in
the
fourteenth
,
the
appearance
of
*NL*
Achilles
unarmed
and
his
heavenly
armour
in
the
eighteenth
,
and
the
*NL*
funeral
games
in
the
twenty-third
.
I
have
also
done
some
Hesiod
,
a
*NL*
little
scrap
of
Thucydides
,
and
a
lot
of
the
Greek
Testament
...
I
*NL*
wish
there
was
only
one
dialect
all
the
same
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
done
some
mathematics
,
including
the
first
six
and
the
*NL*
eleventh
and
twelfth
books
of
Euclid
;
and
algebra
as
far
as
simple
*NL*
equations
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
something
of
the
Fathers
,
and
something
of
Roman
and
English
*NL*
history
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
things
are
only
a
beginning
.
But
I
shall
not
make
much
*NL*
farther
advance
here
,
from
the
difficulty
of
getting
books
.
Hence
I
*NL*
must
next
concentrate
all
my
energies
on
settling
in
Christminster
.
*NL*
Once
there
I
shall
so
advance
,
with
the
assistance
I
shall
there
*NL*
get
,
that
my
present
knowledge
will
appear
to
me
but
as
childish
*NL*
ignorance
.
I
must
save
money
,
and
I
will
;
and
one
of
those
colleges
*NL*
shall
open
its
doors
to
me
--
shall
welcome
whom
now
it
would
spurn
,
*NL*
if
I
wait
twenty
years
for
the
welcome
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
be
D.D.
before
I
have
done
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
he
continued
to
dream
,
and
thought
he
might
become
even
a
*NL*
bishop
by
leading
a
pure
,
energetic
,
wise
,
Christian
life
.
And
what
*NL*
an
example
he
would
set
!
If
his
income
were
L5000
a
year
,
he
would
*NL*
give
away
L4500
in
one
form
and
another
,
and
live
sumptuously
-LRB-
for
*NL*
him
-RRB-
on
the
remainder
.
Well
,
on
second
thoughts
,
a
bishop
was
*NL*
absurd
.
He
would
draw
the
line
at
an
archdeacon
.
Perhaps
a
man
*NL*
could
be
as
good
and
as
learned
and
as
useful
in
the
capacity
of
*NL*
archdeacon
as
in
that
of
bishop
.
Yet
he
thought
of
the
bishop
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Meanwhile
I
will
read
,
as
soon
as
I
am
settled
in
Christminster
,
*NL*
the
books
I
have
not
been
able
to
get
hold
of
here
:
Livy
,
Tacitus
,
*NL*
Herodotus
,
Aeschylus
,
Sophocles
,
Aristophanes
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
Hoity-toity
!
''
The
sounds
were
expressed
in
light
*NL*
voices
on
the
other
side
of
the
hedge
,
but
he
did
not
notice
them
.
*NL*
His
thoughts
went
on
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
--
Euripides
,
Plato
,
Aristotle
,
Lucretius
,
Epictetus
,
Seneca
,
*NL*
Antoninus
.
Then
I
must
master
other
things
:
the
Fathers
thoroughly
;
*NL*
Bede
and
ecclesiastical
history
generally
;
a
smattering
of
Hebrew
--
I
*NL*
only
know
the
letters
as
yet
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hoity-toity
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
--
but
I
can
work
hard
.
I
have
staying
power
in
abundance
,
thank
*NL*
God
!
and
it
is
that
which
tells
...
Yes
,
Christminster
shall
be
my
*NL*
Alma
Mater
;
and
I
'll
be
her
beloved
son
,
in
whom
she
shall
be
well
*NL*
pleased
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
his
deep
concentration
on
these
transactions
of
the
future
Jude
's
*NL*
walk
had
slackened
,
and
he
was
now
standing
quite
still
,
looking
*NL*
at
the
ground
as
though
the
future
were
thrown
thereon
by
a
magic
*NL*
lantern
.
On
a
sudden
something
smacked
him
sharply
in
the
ear
,
and
*NL*
he
became
aware
that
a
soft
cold
substance
had
been
flung
at
him
,
and
*NL*
had
fallen
at
his
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
glance
told
him
what
it
was
--
a
piece
of
flesh
,
the
characteristic
*NL*
part
of
a
barrow-pig
,
which
the
countrymen
used
for
greasing
their
*NL*
boots
,
as
it
was
useless
for
any
other
purpose
.
Pigs
were
rather
*NL*
plentiful
hereabout
,
being
bred
and
fattened
in
large
numbers
in
*NL*
certain
parts
of
North
Wessex
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
other
side
of
the
hedge
was
a
stream
,
whence
,
as
he
now
for
*NL*
the
first
time
realized
,
had
come
the
slight
sounds
of
voices
and
*NL*
laughter
that
had
mingled
with
his
dreams
.
He
mounted
the
bank
and
*NL*
looked
over
the
fence
.
On
the
further
side
of
the
stream
stood
a
*NL*
small
homestead
,
having
a
garden
and
pig-sties
attached
;
in
front
of
*NL*
it
,
beside
the
brook
,
three
young
women
were
kneeling
,
with
buckets
*NL*
and
platters
beside
them
containing
heaps
of
pigs
'
chitterlings
,
*NL*
which
they
were
washing
in
the
running
water
.
One
or
two
pairs
of
*NL*
eyes
slyly
glanced
up
,
and
perceiving
that
his
attention
had
at
last
*NL*
been
attracted
,
and
that
he
was
watching
them
,
they
braced
themselves
*NL*
for
inspection
by
putting
their
mouths
demurely
into
shape
and
*NL*
recommencing
their
rinsing
operations
with
assiduity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
!
''
said
Jude
severely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
DID
N'T
throw
it
,
I
tell
you
!
''
asserted
one
girl
to
her
neighbour
,
*NL*
as
if
unconscious
of
the
young
man
's
presence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
I
,
''
the
second
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Anny
,
how
can
you
!
''
said
the
third
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
had
thrown
anything
at
all
,
it
should
n't
have
been
THAT
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pooh
!
I
do
n't
care
for
him
!
''
And
they
laughed
and
continued
their
*NL*
work
,
without
looking
up
,
still
ostentatiously
accusing
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
grew
sarcastic
as
he
wiped
his
face
,
and
caught
their
remarks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
YOU
did
n't
do
it
--
oh
no
!
''
he
said
to
the
up-stream
one
of
the
three
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
whom
he
addressed
was
a
fine
dark-eyed
girl
,
not
exactly
*NL*
handsome
,
but
capable
of
passing
as
such
at
a
little
distance
,
*NL*
despite
some
coarseness
of
skin
and
fibre
.
She
had
a
round
and
*NL*
prominent
bosom
,
full
lips
,
perfect
teeth
,
and
the
rich
complexion
*NL*
of
a
Cochin
hen
's
egg
.
She
was
a
complete
and
substantial
female
*NL*
animal
--
no
more
,
no
less
;
and
Jude
was
almost
certain
that
to
her
was
*NL*
attributable
the
enterprise
of
attracting
his
attention
from
dreams
*NL*
of
the
humaner
letters
to
what
was
simmering
in
the
minds
around
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
you
'll
never
be
told
,
''
said
she
deedily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whoever
did
it
was
wasteful
of
other
people
's
property
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
's
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
want
to
speak
to
me
,
I
suppose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
;
if
you
like
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
clamber
across
,
or
will
you
come
to
the
plank
above
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
she
foresaw
an
opportunity
;
for
somehow
or
other
the
eyes
*NL*
of
the
brown
girl
rested
in
his
own
when
he
had
said
the
words
,
and
*NL*
there
was
a
momentary
flash
of
intelligence
,
a
dumb
announcement
of
*NL*
affinity
_
in
posse
_
between
herself
and
him
,
which
,
so
far
as
Jude
*NL*
Fawley
was
concerned
,
had
no
sort
of
premeditation
in
it
.
She
saw
*NL*
that
he
had
singled
her
out
from
the
three
,
as
a
woman
is
singled
out
*NL*
in
such
cases
,
for
no
reasoned
purpose
of
further
acquaintance
,
but
*NL*
in
commonplace
obedience
to
conjunctive
orders
from
headquarters
,
*NL*
unconsciously
received
by
unfortunate
men
when
the
last
intention
of
*NL*
their
lives
is
to
be
occupied
with
the
feminine
.
*NL*
*NL*
Springing
to
her
feet
,
she
said
:
``
Bring
back
what
is
lying
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
was
now
aware
that
no
message
on
any
matter
connected
with
her
*NL*
father
's
business
had
prompted
her
signal
to
him
.
He
set
down
his
*NL*
basket
of
tools
,
picked
up
the
scrap
of
offal
,
beat
a
pathway
for
*NL*
himself
with
his
stick
,
and
got
over
the
hedge
.
They
walked
in
*NL*
parallel
lines
,
one
on
each
bank
of
the
stream
,
towards
the
small
*NL*
plank
bridge
.
As
the
girl
drew
nearer
to
it
,
she
gave
without
Jude
*NL*
perceiving
it
,
an
adroit
little
suck
to
the
interior
of
each
of
her
*NL*
cheeks
in
succession
,
by
which
curious
and
original
manoeuvre
she
*NL*
brought
as
by
magic
upon
its
smooth
and
rotund
surface
a
perfect
*NL*
dimple
,
which
she
was
able
to
retain
there
as
long
as
she
continued
*NL*
to
smile
.
This
production
of
dimples
at
will
was
a
not
unknown
*NL*
operation
,
which
many
attempted
,
but
only
a
few
succeeded
in
*NL*
accomplishing
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
met
in
the
middle
of
the
plank
,
and
Jude
,
tossing
back
her
*NL*
missile
,
seemed
to
expect
her
to
explain
why
she
had
audaciously
*NL*
stopped
him
by
this
novel
artillery
instead
of
by
hailing
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
,
slyly
looking
in
another
direction
,
swayed
herself
backwards
*NL*
and
forwards
on
her
hand
as
it
clutched
the
rail
of
the
bridge
;
till
,
*NL*
moved
by
amatory
curiosity
,
she
turned
her
eyes
critically
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
think
_
I
_
would
shy
things
at
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
doing
this
for
my
father
,
who
naturally
does
n't
want
anything
*NL*
thrown
away
.
He
makes
that
into
dubbin
.
''
She
nodded
towards
the
*NL*
fragment
on
the
grass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
made
either
of
the
others
throw
it
,
I
wonder
?
''
Jude
asked
,
*NL*
politely
accepting
her
assertion
,
though
he
had
very
large
doubts
as
*NL*
to
its
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Impudence
.
Do
n't
tell
folk
it
was
I
,
mind
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
I
?
I
do
n't
know
your
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
no
.
Shall
I
tell
it
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Arabella
Donn
.
I
'm
living
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
have
known
it
if
I
had
often
come
this
way
.
But
I
mostly
go
*NL*
straight
along
the
high-road
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
father
is
a
pig-breeder
,
and
these
girls
are
helping
me
wash
the
*NL*
innerds
for
black-puddings
and
such
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
talked
a
little
more
and
a
little
more
,
as
they
stood
regarding
*NL*
each
other
and
leaning
against
the
hand-rail
of
the
bridge
.
The
*NL*
unvoiced
call
of
woman
to
man
,
which
was
uttered
very
distinctly
*NL*
by
Arabella
's
personality
,
held
Jude
to
the
spot
against
his
*NL*
intention
--
almost
against
his
will
,
and
in
a
way
new
to
his
*NL*
experience
.
It
is
scarcely
an
exaggeration
to
say
that
till
this
*NL*
moment
Jude
had
never
looked
at
a
woman
to
consider
her
as
such
,
but
*NL*
had
vaguely
regarded
the
sex
as
beings
outside
his
life
and
purposes
.
*NL*
He
gazed
from
her
eyes
to
her
mouth
,
thence
to
her
bosom
,
and
to
her
*NL*
full
round
naked
arms
,
wet
,
mottled
with
the
chill
of
the
water
,
and
*NL*
firm
as
marble
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
nice-looking
girl
you
are
!
''
he
murmured
,
though
the
words
had
*NL*
not
been
necessary
to
express
his
sense
of
her
magnetism
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
should
see
me
Sundays
!
''
she
said
piquantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
suppose
I
could
?
''
he
answered
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
for
you
to
think
on
.
There
's
nobody
after
me
just
now
,
*NL*
though
there
med
be
in
a
week
or
two
.
''
She
had
spoken
this
without
*NL*
a
smile
,
and
the
dimples
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
felt
himself
drifting
strangely
,
but
could
not
help
it
.
``
Will
*NL*
you
let
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
she
had
managed
to
get
back
one
dimple
by
turning
*NL*
her
face
aside
for
a
moment
and
repeating
the
odd
little
sucking
*NL*
operation
before
mentioned
,
Jude
being
still
unconscious
of
more
than
*NL*
a
general
impression
of
her
appearance
.
``
Next
Sunday
?
''
he
hazarded
.
*NL*
``
To-morrow
,
that
is
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
call
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
brightened
with
a
little
glow
of
triumph
,
swept
him
almost
*NL*
tenderly
with
her
eyes
in
turning
,
and
retracing
her
steps
down
the
*NL*
brookside
grass
rejoined
her
companions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
Fawley
shouldered
his
tool-basket
and
resumed
his
lonely
way
,
*NL*
filled
with
an
ardour
at
which
he
mentally
stood
at
gaze
.
He
had
*NL*
just
inhaled
a
single
breath
from
a
new
atmosphere
,
which
had
*NL*
evidently
been
hanging
round
him
everywhere
he
went
,
for
he
knew
not
*NL*
how
long
,
but
had
somehow
been
divided
from
his
actual
breathing
as
*NL*
by
a
sheet
of
glass
.
The
intentions
as
to
reading
,
working
,
and
*NL*
learning
,
which
he
had
so
precisely
formulated
only
a
few
minutes
*NL*
earlier
,
were
suffering
a
curious
collapse
into
a
corner
,
he
knew
not
*NL*
how
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
's
only
a
bit
of
fun
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
faintly
conscious
*NL*
that
to
common
sense
there
was
something
lacking
,
and
still
more
*NL*
obviously
something
redundant
in
the
nature
of
this
girl
who
had
*NL*
drawn
him
to
her
which
made
it
necessary
that
he
should
assert
mere
*NL*
sportiveness
on
his
part
as
his
reason
in
seeking
her
--
something
in
*NL*
her
quite
antipathetic
to
that
side
of
him
which
had
been
occupied
*NL*
with
literary
study
and
the
magnificent
Christminster
dream
.
It
had
*NL*
been
no
vestal
who
chose
THAT
missile
for
opening
her
attack
on
him
.
*NL*
He
saw
this
with
his
intellectual
eye
,
just
for
a
short
fleeting
*NL*
while
,
as
by
the
light
of
a
falling
lamp
one
might
momentarily
see
an
*NL*
inscription
on
a
wall
before
being
enshrouded
in
darkness
.
And
then
*NL*
this
passing
discriminative
power
was
withdrawn
,
and
Jude
was
lost
to
*NL*
all
conditions
of
things
in
the
advent
of
a
fresh
and
wild
pleasure
,
*NL*
that
of
having
found
a
new
channel
for
emotional
interest
hitherto
*NL*
unsuspected
,
though
it
had
lain
close
beside
him
.
He
was
to
meet
*NL*
this
enkindling
one
of
the
other
sex
on
the
following
Sunday
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
the
girl
had
joined
her
companions
,
and
she
silently
*NL*
resumed
her
flicking
and
sousing
of
the
chitterlings
in
the
pellucid
*NL*
stream
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Catched
un
,
my
dear
?
''
laconically
asked
the
girl
called
Anny
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
I
wish
I
had
thrown
something
else
than
that
!
''
*NL*
regretfully
murmured
Arabella
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
!
he
's
nobody
,
though
you
med
think
so
.
He
used
to
drive
old
*NL*
Drusilla
Fawley
's
bread-cart
out
at
Marygreen
,
till
he
`
prenticed
*NL*
himself
at
Alfredston
.
Since
then
he
's
been
very
stuck
up
,
and
*NL*
always
reading
.
He
wants
to
be
a
scholar
,
they
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
care
what
he
is
,
or
anything
about
`
n.
Do
n't
you
think
*NL*
it
,
my
child
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
n't
ye
!
You
need
n't
try
to
deceive
us
!
What
did
you
stay
*NL*
talking
to
him
for
,
if
you
did
n't
want
un
?
Whether
you
do
or
whether
*NL*
you
do
n't
,
he
's
as
simple
as
a
child
.
I
could
see
it
as
you
courted
*NL*
on
the
bridge
,
when
he
looked
at
`
ee
as
if
he
had
never
seen
a
woman
*NL*
before
in
his
born
days
.
Well
,
he
's
to
be
had
by
any
woman
who
can
*NL*
get
him
to
care
for
her
a
bit
,
if
she
likes
to
set
herself
to
catch
*NL*
him
the
right
way
.

*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
Jude
Fawley
was
pausing
in
his
bedroom
with
the
sloping
*NL*
ceiling
,
looking
at
the
books
on
the
table
,
and
then
at
the
black
*NL*
mark
on
the
plaster
above
them
,
made
by
the
smoke
of
his
lamp
in
past
*NL*
months
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Sunday
afternoon
,
four-and-twenty
hours
after
his
meeting
with
*NL*
Arabella
Donn
.
During
the
whole
bygone
week
he
had
been
resolving
to
*NL*
set
this
afternoon
apart
for
a
special
purpose
,
--
the
re-reading
of
*NL*
his
Greek
Testament
--
his
new
one
,
with
better
type
than
his
old
copy
,
*NL*
following
Griesbach
's
text
as
amended
by
numerous
correctors
,
and
*NL*
with
variorum
readings
in
the
margin
.
He
was
proud
of
the
book
,
*NL*
having
obtained
it
by
boldly
writing
to
its
London
publisher
,
a
thing
*NL*
he
had
never
done
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
anticipated
much
pleasure
in
this
afternoon
's
reading
,
under
*NL*
the
quiet
roof
of
his
great-aunt
's
house
as
formerly
,
where
he
now
*NL*
slept
only
two
nights
a
week
.
But
a
new
thing
,
a
great
hitch
,
had
*NL*
happened
yesterday
in
the
gliding
and
noiseless
current
of
his
life
,
*NL*
and
he
felt
as
a
snake
must
feel
who
has
sloughed
off
its
winter
*NL*
skin
,
and
can
not
understand
the
brightness
and
sensitiveness
of
its
*NL*
new
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
would
not
go
out
to
meet
her
,
after
all
.
He
sat
down
,
opened
the
*NL*
book
,
and
with
his
elbows
firmly
planted
on
the
table
,
and
his
hands
*NL*
to
his
temples
,
began
at
the
beginning
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
HE
KAINE
DIATHEKE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Had
he
promised
to
call
for
her
?
Surely
he
had
!
She
would
wait
*NL*
indoors
,
poor
girl
,
and
waste
all
her
afternoon
on
account
of
him
.
*NL*
There
was
a
something
in
her
,
too
,
which
was
very
winning
,
apart
from
*NL*
promises
.
He
ought
not
to
break
faith
with
her
.
Even
though
he
had
*NL*
only
Sundays
and
week-day
evenings
for
reading
he
could
afford
one
*NL*
afternoon
,
seeing
that
other
young
men
afforded
so
many
.
After
*NL*
to-day
he
would
never
probably
see
her
again
.
Indeed
,
it
would
be
*NL*
impossible
,
considering
what
his
plans
were
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
short
,
as
if
materially
,
a
compelling
arm
of
extraordinary
*NL*
muscular
power
seized
hold
of
him
--
something
which
had
nothing
in
*NL*
common
with
the
spirits
and
influences
that
had
moved
him
hitherto
.
*NL*
This
seemed
to
care
little
for
his
reason
and
his
will
,
nothing
for
*NL*
his
so-called
elevated
intentions
,
and
moved
him
along
,
as
a
violent
*NL*
schoolmaster
a
schoolboy
he
has
seized
by
the
collar
,
in
a
direction
*NL*
which
tended
towards
the
embrace
of
a
woman
for
whom
he
had
no
*NL*
respect
,
and
whose
life
had
nothing
in
common
with
his
own
except
*NL*
locality
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
HE
KAINE
DIATHEKE
was
no
more
heeded
,
and
the
predestinate
Jude
*NL*
sprang
up
and
across
the
room
.
Foreseeing
such
an
event
he
had
*NL*
already
arrayed
himself
in
his
best
clothes
.
In
three
minutes
he
was
*NL*
out
of
the
house
and
descending
by
the
path
across
the
wide
vacant
*NL*
hollow
of
corn-ground
which
lay
between
the
village
and
the
isolated
*NL*
house
of
Arabella
in
the
dip
beyond
the
upland
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
walked
he
looked
at
his
watch
.
He
could
be
back
in
two
hours
,
*NL*
easily
,
and
a
good
long
time
would
still
remain
to
him
for
reading
*NL*
after
tea
.
*NL*
*NL*
Passing
the
few
unhealthy
fir-trees
and
cottage
where
the
path
*NL*
joined
the
highway
he
hastened
along
,
and
struck
away
to
the
left
,
*NL*
descending
the
steep
side
of
the
country
to
the
west
of
the
Brown
*NL*
House
.
Here
at
the
base
of
the
chalk
formation
he
neared
the
brook
*NL*
that
oozed
from
it
,
and
followed
the
stream
till
he
reached
her
*NL*
dwelling
.
A
smell
of
piggeries
came
from
the
back
,
and
the
grunting
*NL*
of
the
originators
of
that
smell
.
He
entered
the
garden
,
and
knocked
*NL*
at
the
door
with
the
knob
of
his
stick
.
*NL*
*NL*
Somebody
had
seen
him
through
the
window
,
for
a
male
voice
on
the
*NL*
inside
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Arabella
!
Here
's
your
young
man
come
coorting
!
Mizzle
,
my
girl
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
winced
at
the
words
.
Courting
in
such
a
businesslike
aspect
as
*NL*
it
evidently
wore
to
the
speaker
was
the
last
thing
he
was
thinking
*NL*
of
.
He
was
going
to
walk
with
her
,
perhaps
kiss
her
;
but
``
courting
''
*NL*
was
too
coolly
purposeful
to
be
anything
but
repugnant
to
his
ideas
.
*NL*
The
door
was
opened
and
he
entered
,
just
as
Arabella
came
downstairs
*NL*
in
radiant
walking
attire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
a
chair
,
Mr.
What
's
-
your-name
?
''
said
her
father
,
an
energetic
,
*NL*
black-whiskered
man
,
in
the
same
businesslike
tones
Jude
had
heard
*NL*
from
outside
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
rather
go
out
at
once
,
would
n't
you
?
''
she
whispered
to
Jude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
he
.
``
We
'll
walk
up
to
the
Brown
House
and
back
,
we
can
*NL*
do
it
in
half
an
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Arabella
looked
so
handsome
amid
her
untidy
surroundings
that
he
felt
*NL*
glad
he
had
come
,
and
all
the
misgivings
vanished
that
had
hitherto
*NL*
haunted
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
First
they
clambered
to
the
top
of
the
great
down
,
during
which
*NL*
ascent
he
had
occasionally
to
take
her
hand
to
assist
her
.
Then
*NL*
they
bore
off
to
the
left
along
the
crest
into
the
ridgeway
,
which
*NL*
they
followed
till
it
intersected
the
high-road
at
the
Brown
*NL*
House
aforesaid
,
the
spot
of
his
former
fervid
desires
to
behold
*NL*
Christminster
.
But
he
forgot
them
now
.
He
talked
the
commonest
*NL*
local
twaddle
to
Arabella
with
greater
zest
than
he
would
have
felt
*NL*
in
discussing
all
the
philosophies
with
all
the
Dons
in
the
recently
*NL*
adored
university
,
and
passed
the
spot
where
he
had
knelt
to
Diana
*NL*
and
Phoebus
without
remembering
that
there
were
any
such
people
in
*NL*
the
mythology
,
or
that
the
sun
was
anything
else
than
a
useful
*NL*
lamp
for
illuminating
Arabella
's
face
.
An
indescribable
lightness
*NL*
of
heel
served
to
lift
him
along
;
and
Jude
,
the
incipient
scholar
,
*NL*
prospective
D.D.
,
professor
,
bishop
,
or
what
not
,
felt
himself
*NL*
honoured
and
glorified
by
the
condescension
of
this
handsome
country
*NL*
wench
in
agreeing
to
take
a
walk
with
him
in
her
Sunday
frock
and
*NL*
ribbons
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
reached
the
Brown
House
barn
--
the
point
at
which
he
had
planned
*NL*
to
turn
back
.
While
looking
over
the
vast
northern
landscape
from
*NL*
this
spot
they
were
struck
by
the
rising
of
a
dense
volume
of
smoke
*NL*
from
the
neighbourhood
of
the
little
town
which
lay
beneath
them
at
a
*NL*
distance
of
a
couple
of
miles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
fire
,
''
said
Arabella
.
``
Let
's
run
and
see
it
--
do
!
It
is
not
*NL*
far
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
tenderness
which
had
grown
up
in
Jude
's
bosom
left
him
no
will
to
*NL*
thwart
her
inclination
now
--
which
pleased
him
in
affording
him
excuse
*NL*
for
a
longer
time
with
her
.
They
started
off
down
the
hill
almost
at
*NL*
a
trot
;
but
on
gaining
level
ground
at
the
bottom
,
and
walking
a
*NL*
mile
,
they
found
that
the
spot
of
the
fire
was
much
further
off
than
*NL*
it
had
seemed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
begun
their
journey
,
however
,
they
pushed
on
;
but
it
was
not
*NL*
till
five
o'clock
that
they
found
themselves
on
the
scene
,
--
the
*NL*
distance
being
altogether
about
half-a-dozen
miles
from
Marygreen
,
*NL*
and
three
from
Arabella
's
.
The
conflagration
had
been
got
under
*NL*
by
the
time
they
reached
it
,
and
after
a
short
inspection
of
the
*NL*
melancholy
ruins
they
retraced
their
steps
--
their
course
lying
*NL*
through
the
town
of
Alfredston
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arabella
said
she
would
like
some
tea
,
and
they
entered
an
inn
of
an
*NL*
inferior
class
,
and
gave
their
order
.
As
it
was
not
for
beer
they
*NL*
had
a
long
time
to
wait
.
The
maid-servant
recognized
Jude
,
and
*NL*
whispered
her
surprise
to
her
mistress
in
the
background
,
that
he
,
*NL*
the
student
``
who
kept
hisself
up
so
particular
,
''
should
have
suddenly
*NL*
descended
so
low
as
to
keep
company
with
Arabella
.
The
latter
*NL*
guessed
what
was
being
said
,
and
laughed
as
she
met
the
serious
and
*NL*
tender
gaze
of
her
lover
--
the
low
and
triumphant
laugh
of
a
careless
*NL*
woman
who
sees
she
is
winning
her
game
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
sat
and
looked
round
the
room
,
and
at
the
picture
of
Samson
and
*NL*
Delilah
which
hung
on
the
wall
,
and
at
the
circular
beer-stains
on
*NL*
the
table
,
and
at
the
spittoons
underfoot
filled
with
sawdust
.
The
*NL*
whole
aspect
of
the
scene
had
that
depressing
effect
on
Jude
which
*NL*
few
places
can
produce
like
a
tap-room
on
a
Sunday
evening
when
*NL*
the
setting
sun
is
slanting
in
,
and
no
liquor
is
going
,
and
the
*NL*
unfortunate
wayfarer
finds
himself
with
no
other
haven
of
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
began
to
grow
dusk
.
They
could
not
wait
longer
,
really
,
for
the
*NL*
tea
,
they
said
.
``
Yet
what
else
can
we
do
?
''
asked
Jude
.
``
It
is
a
*NL*
three-mile
walk
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
we
can
have
some
beer
,
''
said
Arabella
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Beer
,
oh
yes
.
I
had
forgotten
that
.
Somehow
it
seems
odd
to
come
*NL*
to
a
public-house
for
beer
on
a
Sunday
evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
we
did
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
we
did
n't
.
''
Jude
by
this
time
wished
he
was
out
of
such
an
*NL*
uncongenial
atmosphere
;
but
he
ordered
the
beer
,
which
was
promptly
*NL*
brought
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arabella
tasted
it
.
``
Ugh
!
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
tasted
.
``
What
's
the
matter
with
it
?
''
he
asked
.
``
I
do
n't
*NL*
understand
beer
very
much
now
,
it
is
true
.
I
like
it
well
enough
,
*NL*
but
it
is
bad
to
read
on
,
and
I
find
coffee
better
.
But
this
seems
*NL*
all
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Adulterated
--
I
ca
n't
touch
it
!
''
She
mentioned
three
or
four
*NL*
ingredients
that
she
detected
in
the
liquor
beyond
malt
and
hops
,
*NL*
much
to
Jude
's
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
you
know
!
''
he
said
good-humouredly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
she
returned
to
the
beer
and
drank
her
share
,
and
they
*NL*
went
on
their
way
.
It
was
now
nearly
dark
,
and
as
soon
as
they
had
*NL*
withdrawn
from
the
lights
of
the
town
they
walked
closer
together
,
*NL*
till
they
touched
each
other
.
She
wondered
why
he
did
not
put
his
*NL*
arm
round
her
waist
,
but
he
did
not
;
he
merely
said
what
to
himself
*NL*
seemed
a
quite
bold
enough
thing
:
``
Take
my
arm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
it
,
thoroughly
,
up
to
the
shoulder
.
He
felt
the
warmth
of
*NL*
her
body
against
his
,
and
putting
his
stick
under
his
other
arm
held
*NL*
with
his
right
hand
her
right
as
it
rested
in
its
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
we
are
well
together
,
dear
,
are
n't
we
?
''
he
observed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
she
;
adding
to
herself
:
``
Rather
mild
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
fast
I
have
become
!
''
he
was
thinking
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
they
walked
till
they
reached
the
foot
of
the
upland
,
where
they
*NL*
could
see
the
white
highway
ascending
before
them
in
the
gloom
.
From
*NL*
this
point
the
only
way
of
getting
to
Arabella
's
was
by
going
up
the
*NL*
incline
,
and
dipping
again
into
her
valley
on
the
right
.
Before
they
*NL*
had
climbed
far
they
were
nearly
run
into
by
two
men
who
had
been
*NL*
walking
on
the
grass
unseen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
lovers
--
you
find
'em
out
o
'
doors
in
all
seasons
and
*NL*
weathers
--
lovers
and
homeless
dogs
only
,
''
said
one
of
the
men
as
*NL*
they
vanished
down
the
hill
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arabella
tittered
lightly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
we
lovers
?
''
asked
Jude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
best
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
can
tell
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
answer
she
inclined
her
head
upon
his
shoulder
.
Jude
took
the
*NL*
hint
,
and
encircling
her
waist
with
his
arm
,
pulled
her
to
him
and
*NL*
kissed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
walked
now
no
longer
arm
in
arm
but
,
as
she
had
desired
,
clasped
*NL*
together
.
After
all
,
what
did
it
matter
since
it
was
dark
,
said
Jude
*NL*
to
himself
.
When
they
were
half-way
up
the
long
hill
they
paused
as
*NL*
by
arrangement
,
and
he
kissed
her
again
.
They
reached
the
top
,
and
*NL*
he
kissed
her
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
keep
your
arm
there
,
if
you
would
like
to
,
''
she
said
gently
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
so
,
thinking
how
trusting
she
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
they
slowly
went
towards
her
home
.
He
had
left
his
cottage
*NL*
at
half-past
three
,
intending
to
be
sitting
down
again
to
the
New
*NL*
Testament
by
half-past
five
.
It
was
nine
o'clock
when
,
with
another
*NL*
embrace
,
he
stood
to
deliver
her
up
at
her
father
's
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
asked
him
to
come
in
,
if
only
for
a
minute
,
as
it
would
seem
so
*NL*
odd
otherwise
,
and
as
if
she
had
been
out
alone
in
the
dark
.
He
gave
*NL*
way
,
and
followed
her
in
.
Immediately
that
the
door
was
opened
he
*NL*
found
,
in
addition
to
her
parents
,
several
neighbours
sitting
round
.
*NL*
They
all
spoke
in
a
congratulatory
manner
,
and
took
him
seriously
as
*NL*
Arabella
's
intended
partner
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
did
not
belong
to
his
set
or
circle
,
and
he
felt
out
of
place
*NL*
and
embarrassed
.
He
had
not
meant
this
:
a
mere
afternoon
of
*NL*
pleasant
walking
with
Arabella
,
that
was
all
he
had
meant
.
He
did
*NL*
not
stay
longer
than
to
speak
to
her
stepmother
,
a
simple
,
quiet
*NL*
woman
without
features
or
character
;
and
bidding
them
all
good
night
*NL*
plunged
with
a
sense
of
relief
into
the
track
over
the
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
that
sense
was
only
temporary
:
Arabella
soon
re-asserted
her
*NL*
sway
in
his
soul
.
He
walked
as
if
he
felt
himself
to
be
another
man
*NL*
from
the
Jude
of
yesterday
.
What
were
his
books
to
him
?
what
were
*NL*
his
intentions
,
hitherto
adhered
to
so
strictly
,
as
to
not
wasting
a
*NL*
single
minute
of
time
day
by
day
?
``
Wasting
!
''
It
depended
on
your
*NL*
point
of
view
to
define
that
:
he
was
just
living
for
the
first
*NL*
time
:
not
wasting
life
.
It
was
better
to
love
a
woman
than
to
be
a
*NL*
graduate
,
or
a
parson
;
ay
,
or
a
pope
!
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
got
back
to
the
house
his
aunt
had
gone
to
bed
,
and
a
general
*NL*
consciousness
of
his
neglect
seemed
written
on
the
face
of
all
things
*NL*
confronting
him
.
He
went
upstairs
without
a
light
,
and
the
dim
*NL*
interior
of
his
room
accosted
him
with
sad
inquiry
.
There
lay
his
*NL*
book
open
,
just
as
he
had
left
it
,
and
the
capital
letters
on
the
*NL*
title-page
regarded
him
with
fixed
reproach
in
the
grey
starlight
,
*NL*
like
the
unclosed
eyes
of
a
dead
man
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
HE
KAINE
DIATHEKE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
had
to
leave
early
next
morning
for
his
usual
week
of
absence
at
*NL*
lodgings
;
and
it
was
with
a
sense
of
futility
that
he
threw
into
his
*NL*
basket
upon
his
tools
and
other
necessaries
the
unread
book
he
had
*NL*
brought
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
kept
his
impassioned
doings
a
secret
almost
from
himself
.
*NL*
Arabella
,
on
the
contrary
,
made
them
public
among
all
her
friends
*NL*
and
acquaintances
.
*NL*
*NL*
Retracing
by
the
light
of
dawn
the
road
he
had
followed
a
few
hours
*NL*
earlier
under
cover
of
darkness
,
with
his
sweetheart
by
his
side
,
he
*NL*
reached
the
bottom
of
the
hill
,
where
he
walked
slowly
,
and
stood
*NL*
still
.
He
was
on
the
spot
where
he
had
given
her
the
first
kiss
.
As
*NL*
the
sun
had
only
just
risen
it
was
possible
that
nobody
had
passed
*NL*
there
since
.
Jude
looked
on
the
ground
and
sighed
.
He
looked
*NL*
closely
,
and
could
just
discern
in
the
damp
dust
the
imprints
of
*NL*
their
feet
as
they
had
stood
locked
in
each
other
's
arms
.
She
was
*NL*
not
there
now
,
and
``
the
embroidery
of
imagination
upon
the
stuff
of
*NL*
nature
''
so
depicted
her
past
presence
that
a
void
was
in
his
heart
*NL*
which
nothing
could
fill
.
A
pollard
willow
stood
close
to
the
place
,
*NL*
and
that
willow
was
different
from
all
other
willows
in
the
world
.
*NL*
Utter
annihilation
of
the
six
days
which
must
elapse
before
he
could
*NL*
see
her
again
as
he
had
promised
would
have
been
his
intensest
wish
*NL*
if
he
had
had
only
the
week
to
live
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
hour
and
a
half
later
Arabella
came
along
the
same
way
with
her
*NL*
two
companions
of
the
Saturday
.
She
passed
unheedingly
the
scene
of
*NL*
the
kiss
,
and
the
willow
that
marked
it
,
though
chattering
freely
on
*NL*
the
subject
to
the
other
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
did
he
tell
`
ee
next
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
he
said
--
''
And
she
related
almost
word
for
word
some
of
his
*NL*
tenderest
speeches
.
If
Jude
had
been
behind
the
fence
he
would
have
*NL*
felt
not
a
little
surprised
at
learning
how
very
few
of
his
sayings
*NL*
and
doings
on
the
previous
evening
were
private
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
got
him
to
care
for
`
ee
a
bit
,
`
nation
if
you
ha
n't
!
''
*NL*
murmured
Anny
judicially
.
``
It
's
well
to
be
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
few
moments
Arabella
replied
in
a
curiously
low
,
hungry
tone
of
*NL*
latent
sensuousness
:
``
I
've
got
him
to
care
for
me
:
yes
!
But
I
want
*NL*
him
to
more
than
care
for
me
;
I
want
him
to
have
me
--
to
marry
me
!
I
*NL*
must
have
him
.
I
ca
n't
do
without
him
.
He
's
the
sort
of
man
I
long
*NL*
for
.
I
shall
go
mad
if
I
ca
n't
give
myself
to
him
altogether
!
I
*NL*
felt
I

is
a
romancing

honest
chap

's
to
be

and

husband

if
you
set
about
catching
him
in
the
right
way

''
*NL*
*NL*
Arabella
remained
thinking
awhile
.
``
What
med
be
the
right
way
?
''
she
*NL*
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
you
do
n't
know
--
you
do
n't
!
''
said
Sarah
,
the
third
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
my
word
I
do
n't
!
--
No
further
,
that
is
,
than
by
plain
courting
,
*NL*
and
taking
care
he
do
n't
go
too
far
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
third
girl
looked
at
the
second
.
``
She
DO
N'T
know
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
clear
she
do
n't
!
''
said
Anny
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
having
lived
in
a
town
,
too
,
as
one
may
say
!
Well
,
we
can
teach

som

at

well

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

do
you
mean

a
sure
way
to
gain
a
man

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*

``

such

''
*NL*
*NL*
Arabella
's
companions
looked
at
each
other
,
and
turning
up
their
eyes
*NL*
in
drollery
began
smirking
.
Then
one
went
up
close
to
Arabella
,
and
,
*NL*
although
nobody
was
near
,
imparted
some
information
in
a
low
tone
,
*NL*
the
other
observing
curiously
the
effect
upon
Arabella
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
the
last-named
slowly
.
``
I
own
I
did
n't
think
of
that
*NL*
way
!

But
suppose
he
IS
N'T
honourable

A
woman
had
better
not

have
tried
it
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
venture
nothing
have

you
make
sure

's

honourable
before
you
begin

You
'd
be
safe
enough
with
yours
.
I
*NL*
wish
I
had
the
chance
!
Lots
of
girls
do
it
;
or
do
you
think
they
'd
*NL*
get
married
at
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Arabella
pursued
her
way
in
silent
thought
.
``
I
'll
try
it
!
''
she
*NL*
whispered
;
but
not
to
them
.

VIII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
One
week
's
end
Jude
was
as
usual
walking
out
to
his
aunt
's
at
*NL*
Marygreen
from
his
lodging
in
Alfredston
,
a
walk
which
now
had
large
*NL*
attractions
for
him
quite
other
than
his
desire
to
see
his
aged
and
*NL*
morose
relative
.
He
diverged
to
the
right
before
ascending
the
hill
*NL*
with
the
single
purpose
of
gaining
,
on
his
way
,
a
glimpse
of
Arabella
*NL*
that
should
not
come
into
the
reckoning
of
regular
appointments
.
*NL*
Before
quite
reaching
the
homestead
his
alert
eye
perceived
the
top
*NL*
of
her
head
moving
quickly
hither
and
thither
over
the
garden
hedge
.
*NL*
Entering
the
gate
he
found
that
three
young
unfattened
pigs
had
*NL*
escaped
from
their
sty
by
leaping
clean
over
the
top
,
and
that
she
*NL*
was
endeavouring
unassisted
to
drive
them
in
through
the
door
which
*NL*
she
had
set
open
.
The
lines
of
her
countenance
changed
from
the
*NL*
rigidity
of
business
to
the
softness
of
love
when
she
saw
Jude
,
and
*NL*
she
bent
her
eyes
languishingly
upon
him
.
The
animals
took
advantage
*NL*
of
the
pause
by
doubling
and
bolting
out
of
the
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
were
only
put
in
this
morning
!
''
she
cried
,
stimulated
to
pursue
*NL*
in
spite
of
her
lover
's
presence
.
``
They
were
drove
from
Spaddleholt
*NL*
Farm
only
yesterday
,
where
Father
bought
'em
at
a
stiff
price
enough
.
*NL*
They
are
wanting
to
get
home
again
,
the
stupid
toads
!
Will
you
shut
*NL*
the
garden
gate
,
dear
,
and
help
me
to
get
'em
in
.
There
are
no
men
*NL*
folk
at
home
,
only
Mother
,
and
they
'll
be
lost
if
we
do
n't
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
set
himself
to
assist
,
and
dodged
this
way
and
that
over
the
*NL*
potato
rows
and
the
cabbages
.
Every
now
and
then
they
ran
together
,
*NL*
when
he
caught
her
for
a
moment
and
kissed
her
.
The
first
pig
was
*NL*
got
back
promptly
;
the
second
with
some
difficulty
;
the
third
a
*NL*
long-legged
creature
,
was
more
obstinate
and
agile
.
He
plunged
*NL*
through
a
hole
in
the
garden
hedge
,
and
into
the
lane
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
'll
be
lost
if
I
do
n't
follow
`
n
!
''
said
she
.
``
Come
along
with
*NL*
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
rushed
in
full
pursuit
out
of
the
garden
,
Jude
alongside
her
,
*NL*
barely
contriving
to
keep
the
fugitive
in
sight
.
Occasionally
they
*NL*
would
shout
to
some
boy
to
stop
the
animal
,
but
he
always
wriggled
*NL*
past
and
ran
on
as
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
take
your
hand
,
darling
,
''
said
Jude
.
``
You
are
getting
out
of
*NL*
breath
.
''
She
gave
him
her
now
hot
hand
with
apparent
willingness
,
*NL*
and
they
trotted
along
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
comes
of
driving
'em
home
,
''
she
remarked
.
``
They
always
know
*NL*
the
way
back
if
you
do
that
.
They
ought
to
have
been
carted
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
the
pig
had
reached
an
unfastened
gate
admitting
to
the
*NL*
open
down
,
across
which
he
sped
with
all
the
agility
his
little
legs
*NL*
afforded
.
As
soon
as
the
pursuers
had
entered
and
ascended
to
the
*NL*
top
of
the
high
ground
it
became
apparent
that
they
would
have
to
run
*NL*
all
the
way
to
the
farmer
's
if
they
wished
to
get
at
him
.
From
this
*NL*
summit
he
could
be
seen
as
a
minute
speck
,
following
an
unerring
line
*NL*
towards
his
old
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
no
good
!
''
cried
Arabella
.
``
He
'll
be
there
long
before
we
get
*NL*
there
.
It
do
n't
matter
now
we
know
he
's
not
lost
or
stolen
on
the
*NL*
way
.
They
'll
see
it
is
ours
,
and
send
un
back
.
Oh
dear
,
how
hot
I
*NL*
be
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Without
relinquishing
her
hold
of
Jude
's
hand
she
swerved
aside
and
*NL*
flung
herself
down
on
the
sod
under
a
stunted
thorn
,
precipitately
*NL*
pulling
Jude
on
to
his
knees
at
the
same
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
ask
pardon
--
I
nearly
threw
you
down
,
did
n't
I
!
But
I
am
so
*NL*
tired
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
lay
supine
,
and
straight
as
an
arrow
,
on
the
sloping
sod
of
this
*NL*
hill-top
,
gazing
up
into
the
blue
miles
of
sky
,
and
still
retaining
*NL*
her
warm
hold
of
Jude
's
hand
.
He
reclined
on
his
elbow
near
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
've
run
all
this
way
for
nothing
,
''
she
went
on
,
her
form
heaving
*NL*
and
falling
in
quick
pants
,
her
face
flushed
,
her
full
red
lips
*NL*
parted
,
and
a
fine
dew
of
perspiration
on
her
skin
.
``
Well
--
why
do
n't
*NL*
you
speak
,
deary
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
blown
too
.
It
was
all
up
hill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
in
absolute
solitude
--
the
most
apparent
of
all
solitudes
,
*NL*
that
of
empty
surrounding
space
.
Nobody
could
be
nearer
than
a
mile
*NL*
to
them
without
their
seeing
him
.
They
were
,
in
fact
,
on
one
of
the
*NL*
summits
of
the
county
,
and
the
distant
landscape
around
Christminster
*NL*
could
be
discerned
from
where
they
lay
.
But
Jude
did
not
think
of
*NL*
that
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
can
see
such
a
pretty
thing
up
this
tree
,
''
said
Arabella
.
``
A
*NL*
sort
of
a
--
caterpillar
,
of
the
most
loveliest
green
and
yellow
you
*NL*
ever
came
across
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
?
''
said
Jude
,
sitting
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
see
him
there
--
you
must
come
here
,
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
bent
nearer
and
put
his
head
in
front
of
hers
.
``
No
--
I
ca
n't
see
*NL*
it
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
on
the
limb
there
where
it
branches
off
--
close
to
the
moving
*NL*
leaf
--
there
!
''
She
gently
pulled
him
down
beside
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
see
it
,
''
he
repeated
,
the
back
of
his
head
against
her
*NL*
cheek
.
``
But
I
can
,
perhaps
,
standing
up
.
''
He
stood
accordingly
,
*NL*
placing
himself
in
the
direct
line
of
her
gaze
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
stupid
you
are
!
''
she
said
crossly
,
turning
away
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
care
to
see
it
,
dear
:
why
should
I
?
''
he
replied
looking
*NL*
down
upon
her
.
``
Get
up
,
Abby
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
you
to
let
me
kiss
you
.
I
've
been
waiting
to
ever
so
long
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
rolled
round
her
face
,
remained
a
moment
looking
deedily
aslant
*NL*
at
him
;
then
with
a
slight
curl
of
the
lip
sprang
to
her
feet
,
and
*NL*
exclaiming
abruptly
``
I
must
mizzle
!
''
walked
off
quickly
homeward
.
*NL*
Jude
followed
and
rejoined
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
one
!
''
he
coaxed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sha
n't
!
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
,
surprised
:
``
What
's
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
kept
her
two
lips
resentfully
together
,
and
Jude
followed
her
*NL*
like
a
pet
lamb
till
she
slackened
her
pace
and
walked
beside
him
,
*NL*
talking
calmly
on
indifferent
subjects
,
and
always
checking
him
if
*NL*
he
tried
to
take
her
hand
or
clasp
her
waist
.
Thus
they
descended
*NL*
to
the
precincts
of
her
father
's
homestead
,
and
Arabella
went
in
,
*NL*
nodding
good-bye
to
him
with
a
supercilious
,
affronted
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
expect
I
took
too
much
liberty
with
her
,
somehow
,
''
Jude
said
to
*NL*
himself
,
as
he
withdrew
with
a
sigh
and
went
on
to
Marygreen
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
Sunday
morning
the
interior
of
Arabella
's
home
was
,
as
usual
,
*NL*
the
scene
of
a
grand
weekly
cooking
,
the
preparation
of
the
special
*NL*
Sunday
dinner
.
Her
father
was
shaving
before
a
little
glass
hung
on
*NL*
the
mullion
of
the
window
,
and
her
mother
and
Arabella
herself
were
*NL*
shelling
beans
hard
by
.
A
neighbour
passed
on
her
way
home
from
*NL*
morning
service
at
the
nearest
church
,
and
seeing
Donn
engaged
at
*NL*
the
window
with
the
razor
,
nodded
and
came
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
at
once
spoke
playfully
to
Arabella
:
``
I
zeed
`
ee
running
with
*NL*
`
un
--
hee-hee
!
I
hope
't
is
coming
to
something
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Arabella
merely
threw
a
look
of
consciousness
into
her
face
without
*NL*
raising
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
for
Christminster
,
I
hear
,
as
soon
as
he
can
get
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
heard
that
lately
--
quite
lately
?
''
asked
Arabella
with
a
*NL*
jealous
,
tigerish
indrawing
of
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
!
But
it
has
been
known
a
long
time
that
it
is
his
plan
.
He
's
*NL*
on
'
y
waiting
here
for
an
opening
.
Ah
well
:
he
must
walk
about
with
*NL*
somebody
,
I
s
`
pose
.
Young
men
do
n't
mean
much
now-a-days
.
'T
is
a
sip
*NL*
here
and
a
sip
there
with
'em
.
'T
was
different
in
my
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
gossip
had
departed
Arabella
said
suddenly
to
her
mother
:
*NL*
``
I
want
you
and
Father
to
go
and
inquire
how
the
Edlins
be
,
this
*NL*
evening
after
tea
.
Or
no
--
there
's
evening
service
at
Fensworth
--
you
*NL*
can
walk
to
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
?
What
's
up
to-night
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
.
Only
I
want
the
house
to
myself
.
He
's
shy
;
and
I
ca
n't
*NL*
get
un
to
come
in
when
you
are
here
.
I
shall
let
him
slip
through
my
*NL*
fingers
if
I
do
n't
mind
,
much
as
I
care
for
`
n
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
is
fine
we
med
as
well
go
,
since
you
wish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
afternoon
Arabella
met
and
walked
with
Jude
,
who
had
now
*NL*
for
weeks
ceased
to
look
into
a
book
of
Greek
,
Latin
,
or
any
other
*NL*
tongue
.
They
wandered
up
the
slopes
till
they
reached
the
green
*NL*
track
along
the
ridge
,
which
they
followed
to
the
circular
British
*NL*
earth-bank
adjoining
,
Jude
thinking
of
the
great
age
of
the
trackway
,
*NL*
and
of
the
drovers
who
had
frequented
it
,
probably
before
the
Romans
*NL*
knew
the
country
.
Up
from
the
level
lands
below
them
floated
the
*NL*
chime
of
church
bells
.
Presently
they
were
reduced
to
one
note
,
*NL*
which
quickened
,
and
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
we
'll
go
back
,
''
said
Arabella
,
who
had
attended
to
the
sounds
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
assented
.
So
long
as
he
was
near
her
he
minded
little
where
he
*NL*
was
.
When
they
arrived
at
her
house
he
said
lingeringly
:
``
I
wo
n't
*NL*
come
in
.
Why
are
you
in
such
a
hurry
to
go
in
to-night
?
It
is
not
*NL*
near
dark
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
a
moment
,
''
said
she
.
She
tried
the
handle
of
the
door
and
*NL*
found
it
locked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
--
they
are
gone
to
church
,
''
she
added
.
And
searching
behind
the
*NL*
scraper
she
found
the
key
and
unlocked
the
door
.
``
Now
,
you
'll
come
*NL*
in
a
moment
?
''
she
asked
lightly
.
``
We
shall
be
all
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
''
said
Jude
with
alacrity
,
the
case
being
unexpectedly
*NL*
altered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Indoors
they
went
.
Did
he
want
any
tea
?
No
,
it
was
too
late
:
he
*NL*
would
rather
sit
and
talk
to
her
.
She
took
off
her
jacket
and
hat
,
*NL*
and
they
sat
down
--
naturally
enough
close
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
touch
me
,
please
,
''
she
said
softly
.
``
I
am
part
egg-shell
.
Or
*NL*
perhaps
I
had
better
put
it
in
a
safe
place
.
''
She
began
unfastening
*NL*
the
collar
of
her
gown
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
said
her
lover
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
egg
--
a
cochin
's
egg
.
I
am
hatching
a
very
rare
sort
.
I
carry
it
*NL*
about
everywhere
with
me
,
and
it
will
get
hatched
in
less
than
three
*NL*
weeks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
do
you
carry
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
here
.
''
She
put
her
hand
into
her
bosom
and
drew
out
the
egg
,
*NL*
which
was
wrapped
in
wool
,
outside
it
being
a
piece
of
pig
's
bladder
,
*NL*
in
case
of
accidents
.
Having
exhibited
it
to
him
she
put
it
back
,
*NL*
``
Now
mind
you
do
n't
come
near
me
.
I
do
n't
want
to
get
it
broke
,
and
*NL*
have
to
begin
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
do
such
a
strange
thing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
an
old
custom
.
I
suppose
it
is
natural
for
a
woman
to
want
to
*NL*
bring
live
things
into
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
very
awkward
for
me
just
now
,
''
he
said
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
serves
you
right
.
There
--
that
's
all
you
can
have
of
me
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
turned
round
her
chair
,
and
,
reaching
over
the
back
of
it
,
*NL*
presented
her
cheek
to
him
gingerly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
very
shabby
of
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
have
catched
me
a
minute
ago
when
I
had
put
the
egg
down
!
*NL*
There
!
''
she
said
defiantly
,
``
I
am
without
it
now
!
''
She
had
quickly
*NL*
withdrawn
the
egg
a
second
time
;
but
before
he
could
quite
reach
her
*NL*
she
had
put
it
back
as
quickly
,
laughing
with
the
excitement
of
her
*NL*
strategy
.
Then
there
was
a
little
struggle
,
Jude
making
a
plunge
for
*NL*
it
and
capturing
it
triumphantly
.
Her
face
flushed
;
and
becoming
*NL*
suddenly
conscious
he
flushed
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
looked
at
each
other
,
panting
;
till
he
rose
and
said
:
``
One
kiss
,
*NL*
now
I
can
do
it
without
damage
to
property
;
and
I
'll
go
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
had
jumped
up
too
.
``
You
must
find
me
first
!
''
she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
lover
followed
her
as
she
withdrew
.
It
was
now
dark
inside
the
*NL*
room
,
and
the
window
being
small
he
could
not
discover
for
a
long
*NL*
time
what
had
become
of
her
,
till
a
laugh
revealed
her
to
have
rushed
*NL*
up
the
stairs
,
whither
Jude
rushed
at
her
heels
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IX
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
some
two
months
later
in
the
year
,
and
the
pair
had
met
*NL*
constantly
during
the
interval
.
Arabella
seemed
dissatisfied
;
she
*NL*
was
always
imagining
,
and
waiting
,
and
wondering
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
she
met
the
itinerant
Vilbert
.
She
,
like
all
the
cottagers
*NL*
thereabout
,
knew
the
quack
well
,
and
she
began
telling
him
of
her
*NL*
experiences
.
Arabella
had
been
gloomy
,
but
before
he
left
her
she
*NL*
had
grown
brighter
.
That
evening
she
kept
an
appointment
with
Jude
,
*NL*
who
seemed
sad
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
away
,
''
he
said
to
her
.
``
I
think
I
ought
to
go
.
I
think
*NL*
it
will
be
better
both
for
you
and
for
me
.
I
wish
some
things
had
*NL*
never
begun
!
I
was
much
to
blame
,
I
know
.
But
it
is
never
too
late
*NL*
to
mend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Arabella
began
to
cry
.
``
How
do
you
know
it
is
not
too
late
?
''
she
*NL*
said
.
``
That
's
all
very
well
to
say
!
I
have
n't
told
you
yet
!
''
and
*NL*
she
looked
into
his
face
with
streaming
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
he
asked
,
turning
pale
.
``
Not
...
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
!
And
what
shall
I
do
if
you
desert
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Arabella
--
how
can
you
say
that
,
my
dear
!
You
KNOW
I
would
n't
*NL*
desert
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
next
to
no
wages
as
yet
,
you
know
;
or
perhaps
I
should
have
*NL*
thought
of
this
before
...
But
,
of
course
if
that
's
the
case
,
we
must
*NL*
marry
!
What
other
thing
do
you
think
I
could
dream
of
doing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
--
I
thought
,
deary
,
perhaps
you
would
go
away
all
the
more
*NL*
for
that
,
and
leave
me
to
face
it
alone
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
knew
better
!
Of
course
I
never
dreamt
six
months
ago
,
or
even
*NL*
three
,
of
marrying
.
It
is
a
complete
smashing
up
of
my
plans
--
I
mean
*NL*
my
plans
before
I
knew
you
,
my
dear
.
But
what
are
they
,
after
all
!
*NL*
Dreams
about
books
,
and
degrees
,
and
impossible
fellowships
,
and
all
*NL*
that
.
Certainly
we
'll
marry
:
we
must
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
night
he
went
out
alone
,
and
walked
in
the
dark
self-communing
.
*NL*
He
knew
well
,
too
well
,
in
the
secret
centre
of
his
brain
,
that
*NL*
Arabella
was
not
worth
a
great
deal
as
a
specimen
of
womankind
.
*NL*
Yet
,
such
being
the
custom
of
the
rural
districts
among
honourable
*NL*
young
men
who
had
drifted
so
far
into
intimacy
with
a
woman
as
he
*NL*
unfortunately
had
done
,
he
was
ready
to
abide
by
what
he
had
said
,
*NL*
and
take
the
consequences
.
For
his
own
soothing
he
kept
up
a
*NL*
factitious
belief
in
her
.
His
idea
of
her
was
the
thing
of
most
*NL*
consequence
,
not
Arabella
herself
,
he
sometimes
said
laconically
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
banns
were
put
in
and
published
the
very
next
Sunday
.
The
people
*NL*
of
the
parish
all
said
what
a
simple
fool
young
Fawley
was
.
All
his
*NL*
reading
had
only
come
to
this
,
that
he
would
have
to
sell
his
books
*NL*
to
buy
saucepans
.
Those
who
guessed
the
probable
state
of
affairs
,
*NL*
Arabella
's
parents
being
among
them
,
declared
that
it
was
the
sort
of
*NL*
conduct
they
would
have
expected
of
such
an
honest
young
man
as
Jude
*NL*
in
reparation
of
the
wrong
he
had
done
his
innocent
sweetheart
.
The
*NL*
parson
who
married
them
seemed
to
think
it
satisfactory
too
.
And
so
,
*NL*
standing
before
the
aforesaid
officiator
,
the
two
swore
that
at
every
*NL*
other
time
of
their
lives
till
death
took
them
,
they
would
assuredly
*NL*
believe
,
feel
,
and
desire
precisely
as
they
had
believed
,
felt
,
and
*NL*
desired
during
the
few
preceding
weeks
.
What
was
as
remarkable
*NL*
as
the
undertaking
itself
was
the
fact
that
nobody
seemed
at
all
*NL*
surprised
at
what
they
swore
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fawley
's
aunt
being
a
baker
she
made
him
a
bride-cake
,
saying
*NL*
bitterly
that
it
was
the
last
thing
she
could
do
for
him
,
poor
silly
*NL*
fellow
;
and
that
it
would
have
been
far
better
if
,
instead
of
his
*NL*
living
to
trouble
her
,
he
had
gone
underground
years
before
with
his
*NL*
father
and
mother
.
Of
this
cake
Arabella
took
some
slices
,
wrapped
*NL*
them
up
in
white
note-paper
,
and
sent
them
to
her
companions
in
the
*NL*
pork-dressing
business
,
Anny
and
Sarah
,
labelling
each
packet
''
_
In
*NL*
remembrance
of
good
advice
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prospects
of
the
newly
married
couple
were
certainly
not
very
*NL*
brilliant
even
to
the
most
sanguine
mind
.
He
,
a
stone-mason
's
*NL*
apprentice
,
nineteen
years
of
age
,
was
working
for
half
wages
till
*NL*
he
should
be
out
of
his
time
.
His
wife
was
absolutely
useless
in
a
*NL*
town-lodging
,
where
he
at
first
had
considered
it
would
be
necessary
*NL*
for
them
to
live
.
But
the
urgent
need
of
adding
to
income
in
ever
so
*NL*
little
a
degree
caused
him
to
take
a
lonely
roadside
cottage
between
*NL*
the
Brown
House
and
Marygreen
,
that
he
might
have
the
profits
of
a
*NL*
vegetable
garden
,
and
utilize
her
past
experiences
by
letting
her
*NL*
keep
a
pig
.
But
it
was
not
the
sort
of
life
he
had
bargained
for
,
*NL*
and
it
was
a
long
way
to
walk
to
and
from
Alfredston
every
day
.
*NL*
Arabella
,
however
,
felt
that
all
these
make-shifts
were
temporary
;
*NL*
she
had
gained
a
husband
;
that
was
the
thing
--
a
husband
with
a
lot
*NL*
of
earning
power
in
him
for
buying
her
frocks
and
hats
when
he
should
*NL*
begin
to
get
frightened
a
bit
,
and
stick
to
his
trade
,
and
throw
*NL*
aside
those
stupid
books
for
practical
undertakings
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
to
the
cottage
he
took
her
on
the
evening
of
the
marriage
,
giving
*NL*
up
his
old
room
at
his
aunt
's
--
where
so
much
of
the
hard
labour
at
*NL*
Greek
and
Latin
had
been
carried
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
little
chill
overspread
him
at
her
first
unrobing
.
A
long
tail
of
*NL*
hair
,
which
Arabella
wore
twisted
up
in
an
enormous
knob
at
the
back
*NL*
of
her
head
,
was
deliberately
unfastened
,
stroked
out
,
and
hung
upon
*NL*
the
looking-glass
which
he
had
bought
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
--
it
was
n't
your
own
?
''
he
said
,
with
a
sudden
distaste
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
--
it
never
is
nowadays
with
the
better
class
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
!
Perhaps
not
in
towns
.
But
in
the
country
it
is
supposed
*NL*
to
be
different
.
Besides
,
you
've
enough
of
your
own
,
surely
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
enough
as
country
notions
go
.
But
in
town
the
men
expect
more
,
*NL*
and
when
I
was
barmaid
at
Aldbrickham
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Barmaid
at
Aldbrickham
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
not
exactly
barmaid
--
I
used
to
draw
the
drink
at
a
*NL*
public-house
there
--
just
for
a
little
time
;
that
was
all
.
Some
*NL*
people
put
me
up
to
getting
this
,
and
I
bought
it
just
for
a
fancy
.
*NL*
The
more
you
have
the
better
in
Aldbrickham
,
which
is
a
finer
town
*NL*
than
all
your
Christminsters
.
Every
lady
of
position
wears
false
*NL*
hair
--
the
barber
's
assistant
told
me
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
thought
with
a
feeling
of
sickness
that
though
this
might
be
*NL*
true
to
some
extent
,
for
all
that
he
knew
,
many
unsophisticated
girls
*NL*
would
and
did
go
to
towns
and
remain
there
for
years
without
losing
*NL*
their
simplicity
of
life
and
embellishments
.
Others
,
alas
,
had
an
*NL*
instinct
towards
artificiality
in
their
very
blood
,
and
became
adepts
*NL*
in
counterfeiting
at
the
first
glimpse
of
it
.
However
,
perhaps
there
*NL*
was
no
great
sin
in
a
woman
adding
to
her
hair
,
and
he
resolved
to
*NL*
think
no
more
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
new-made
wife
can
usually
manage
to
excite
interest
for
a
few
*NL*
weeks
,
even
though
the
prospects
of
the
household
ways
and
means
*NL*
are
cloudy
.
There
is
a
certain
piquancy
about
her
situation
,
and
*NL*
her
manner
to
her
acquaintance
at
the
sense
of
it
,
which
carries
off
*NL*
the
gloom
of
facts
,
and
renders
even
the
humblest
bride
independent
*NL*
awhile
of
the
real
.
Mrs.
Jude
Fawley
was
walking
in
the
streets
of
*NL*
Alfredston
one
market-day
with
this
quality
in
her
carriage
when
she
*NL*
met
Anny
her
former
friend
,
whom
she
had
not
seen
since
the
wedding
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
usual
they
laughed
before
talking
;
the
world
seemed
funny
to
them
*NL*
without
saying
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
it
turned
out
a
good
plan
,
you
see
!
''
remarked
the
girl
to
the
*NL*
wife
.
``
I
knew
it
would
with
such
as
him

He
's
a
dear
good
fellow

*NL*

you
ought
to
be
proud
of
un

``

Mrs.
Fawley
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
when
do

*NL*
``
Ssh

Nevertheless
it
was
with
a
little
uneasiness
that
Arabella
approached
*NL*
the
time
when
in
the
natural
course
of
things
she
would
have
to
*NL*
reveal
that
the
alarm
she
had
raised
had
been
without
foundation
.
*NL*
The
occasion
was
one
evening
at
bedtime
,
and
they
were
in
their
*NL*
chamber
in
the
lonely
cottage
by
the
wayside
to
which
Jude
walked
*NL*
home
from
his
work
every
day
.
He
had
worked
hard
the
whole
twelve
*NL*
hours
,
and
had
retired
to
rest
before
his
wife
.
When
she
came
into
*NL*
the
room
he
was
between
sleeping
and
waking
,
and
was
barely
conscious
*NL*
of
her
undressing
before
the
little
looking-glass
as
he
lay
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
action
of
hers
,
however
,
brought
him
to
full
cognition
.
Her
face
*NL*
being
reflected
towards
him
as
she
sat
,
he
could
perceive
that
she
*NL*
was
amusing
herself
by
artificially
producing
in
each
cheek
the
*NL*
dimple
before
alluded
to
,
a
curious
accomplishment
of
which
she
was
*NL*
mistress
,
effecting
it
by
a
momentary
suction
.
It
seemed
to
him
for
*NL*
the
first
time
that
the
dimples
were
far
oftener
absent
from
her
face
*NL*
during
his
intercourse
with
her
nowadays
than
they
had
been
in
the
*NL*
earlier
weeks
of
their
acquaintance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
do
that
,
Arabella
!
''
he
said
suddenly
.
``
There
is
no
harm
in
*NL*
it
,
but
--
I
do
n't
like
to
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
and
laughed
.
``
Lord
,
I
did
n't
know
you
were
awake
!
''
she
*NL*
said
.
``
How
countrified
you
are
!
That
's
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
did
you
learn
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nowhere

He
sat
bolt
upright
in

and
looked
at

How
can
that
be

He
gave
the
answer
simply
,

lay
down
;
and
there
was
silence
*NL*
between
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Jude
awoke
the
next
morning
he
seemed
to
see
the
world
with
a
*NL*
different
eye
.
As
to
the
point
in
question
he
was
compelled
to
*NL*
accept
her
word
;
in
the
circumstances
he
could
not
have
acted
*NL*
otherwise
while
ordinary
notions
prevailed
.
But
how
came
they
to
*NL*
prevail
?
*NL*
*NL*
There
seemed
to
him
,
vaguely
and
dimly
,
something
wrong
in
a
social
*NL*
ritual
which
made
necessary
a
cancelling
of
well-formed
schemes
*NL*
involving
years
of
thought
and
labour
,
of
foregoing
a
man
's
one
*NL*
opportunity
of
showing
himself
superior
to
the
lower
animals
,
and
of
*NL*
contributing
his
units
of
work
to
the
general
progress
of
his
*NL*
generation
,
because
of
a
momentary
surprise
by
a
new
and
transitory
*NL*
instinct
which
had
nothing
in
it
of
the
nature
of
vice
,
and
could
be
*NL*
only
at
the
most
called
weakness
.
He
was
inclined
to
inquire
what
he
*NL*
had
done
,
or
she
lost
,
for
that
matter
,
that
he
deserved
to
be
caught
*NL*
in
a
gin
which
would
cripple
him
,
if
not
her
also
,
for
the
rest
of
a
*NL*
lifetime
?
There
was
perhaps
something
fortunate
in
the
fact
that
the
*NL*
immediate
reason
of
his
marriage
had
proved
to
be
non-existent
.
But
*NL*
the
marriage
remained
.

The
time
arrived
for
killing
the
pig
which
Jude
and
his
wife
had
*NL*
fattened
in
their
sty
during
the
autumn
months
,
and
the
butchering
*NL*
was
timed
to
take
place
as
soon
as
it
was
light
in
the
morning
,
so
*NL*
that
Jude
might
get
to
Alfredston
without
losing
more
than
a
quarter
*NL*
of
a
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
night
had
seemed
strangely
silent
.
Jude
looked
out
of
the
window
*NL*
long
before
dawn
,
and
perceived
that
the
ground
was
covered
with
*NL*
snow
--
snow
rather
deep
for
the
season
,
it
seemed
,
a
few
flakes
still
*NL*
falling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
afraid
the
pig-killer
wo
n't
be
able
to
come
,
''
he
said
to
*NL*
Arabella
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
he
'll
come
.
You
must
get
up
and
make
the
water
hot
,
if
you
want
*NL*
Challow
to
scald
him
.
Though
I
like
singeing
best
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
get
up
,
''
said
Jude
.
``
I
like
the
way
of
my
own
county
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
downstairs
,
lit
the
fire
under
the
copper
,
and
began
feeding
*NL*
it
with
bean-stalks
,
all
the
time
without
a
candle
,
the
blaze
*NL*
flinging
a
cheerful
shine
into
the
room
;
though
for
him
the
sense
of
*NL*
cheerfulness
was
lessened
by
thoughts
on
the
reason
of
that
blaze
--
to
*NL*
heat
water
to
scald
the
bristles
from
the
body
of
an
animal
that
as
*NL*
yet
lived
,
and
whose
voice
could
be
continually
heard
from
a
corner
*NL*
of
the
garden
.
At
half-past
six
,
the
time
of
appointment
with
the
*NL*
butcher
,
the
water
boiled
,
and
Jude
's
wife
came
downstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Challow
come
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
waited
,
and
it
grew
lighter
,
with
the
dreary
light
of
a
snowy
*NL*
dawn
.
She
went
out
,
gazed
along
the
road
,
and
returning
said
,
``
He
's
*NL*
not
coming
.
Drunk
last
night

I
expect

The
snow
is
not
enough
to

hinder
him

surely

*NL*
``
Then

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
accounts
for
his
crying
so

as

is

such

big
pig
I
had
rather

However

his
basket

o

knives

already
sent

we
can
use
*NL*
'em

*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
you
sha

said
Jude
.
``
I
'll
do
it
,
since
it
must
*NL*
be
done

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
out
to
the
sty
,
shovelled
away
the
snow
for
the
space
of
a
*NL*
couple
of
yards
or
more
,
and
placed
the
stool
in
front
,
with
the
*NL*
knives
and
ropes
at
hand
.
A
robin
peered
down
at
the
preparations
*NL*
from
the
nearest
tree
,
and
,
not
liking
the
sinister
look
of
the
*NL*
scene
,
flew
away
,
though
hungry
.
By
this
time
Arabella
had
joined
*NL*
her
husband
,
and
Jude
,
rope
in
hand
,
got
into
the
sty
,
and
noosed
the
*NL*
affrighted
animal
,
who
,
beginning
with
a
squeak
of
surprise
,
rose
to
*NL*
repeated
cries
of
rage
.
Arabella
opened
the
sty-door
,
and
together
*NL*
they
hoisted
the
victim
on
to
the
stool
,
legs
upward
,
and
while
Jude
*NL*
held
him
Arabella
bound
him
down
,
looping
the
cord
over
his
legs
to
*NL*
keep
him
from
struggling
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
animal
's
note
changed
its
quality
.
It
was
not
now
rage
,
but
the
*NL*
cry
of
despair
;
long-drawn
,
slow
and
hopeless
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
soul
I
would
sooner
have
gone
without
the
pig
than
have
had

this

Jude
.
``
A

*NL*
*NL*
``

she
cried
.
``

a

said
Jude
determinedly
.
Scraping
the
bristles
from
the
pig
's
*NL*
upturned
throat
,
as
he
had
seen
the
butchers
do
,
he
slit
the
fat
;
*NL*
then
plunged
in
the
knife
with
all
his
might
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Od
damn
it
all
!
''
she
cried
,
``
that
ever
I
should
say
it

You
've
*NL*
over-stuck
un

And
I
telling
you
all
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
be
quiet

have
a

pity
on

*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
up
the
pail
to
catch
the
blood

and
do

talk

''
*NL*
*NL*
However
unworkmanlike
the
deed
,
it
had
been
mercifully
done
.
The
*NL*
blood
flowed
out
in
a
torrent
instead
of
in
the
trickling
stream
she
*NL*
had
desired
.
The
dying
animal
's
cry
assumed
its
third
and
final
*NL*
tone
,
the
shriek
of
agony
;
his
glazing
eyes
riveting
themselves
on
*NL*
Arabella
with
the
eloquently
keen
reproach
of
a
creature
recognizing
*NL*
at
last
the
treachery
of
those
who
had
seemed
his
only
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Make
un
stop
that
!
''
said
Arabella
.
``
Such
a
noise
will
bring
*NL*
somebody
or
other
up
here
,
and
I
do
n't
want
people
to
know
we
are
*NL*
doing
it
ourselves
.
''
Picking
up
the
knife
from
the
ground
whereon
*NL*
Jude
had
flung
it
,
she
slipped
it
into
the
gash
,
and
slit
the
*NL*
windpipe
.
The
pig
was
instantly
silent
,
his
dying
breath
coming
*NL*
through
the
hole
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
better
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
hateful
business
!
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pigs
must
be
killed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
animal
heaved
in
a
final
convulsion
,
and
,
despite
the
rope
,
*NL*
kicked
out
with
all
his
last
strength
.
A
tablespoonful
of
black
*NL*
clot
came
forth
,
the
trickling
of
red
blood
having
ceased
for
some
*NL*
seconds
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
it
;
now
he
'll
go
,
''
said
she
.
``
Artful
creatures
--
they
always
*NL*
keep
back
a
drop
like
that
as
long
as
they
can
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
last
plunge
had
come
so
unexpectedly
as
to
make
Jude
stagger
,
and
*NL*
in
recovering
himself
he
kicked
over
the
vessel
in
which
the
blood
*NL*
had
been
caught
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
!
''
she
cried
,
thoroughly
in
a
passion
.
``
Now
I
ca
n't
make
any
*NL*
blackpot
.
There
's
a
waste
,
all
through
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
put
the
pail
upright
,
but
only
about
a
third
of
the
whole
*NL*
steaming
liquid
was
left
in
it
,
the
main
part
being
splashed
over
*NL*
the
snow
,
and
forming
a
dismal
,
sordid
,
ugly
spectacle
--
to
those
who
*NL*
saw
it
as
other
than
an
ordinary
obtaining
of
meat
.
The
lips
and
*NL*
nostrils
of
the
animal
turned
livid
,
then
white
,
and
the
muscles
of
*NL*
his
limbs
relaxed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
God
!
''
Jude
said
.
``
He
's
dead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
God
got
to
do
with
such
a
messy
job
as
a
pig-killing
,
I
*NL*
should
like
to
know
!
''
she
said
scornfully
.
``
Poor
folks
must
live
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
,
I
know
,
''
said
he
.
``
I
do
n't
scold
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
they
became
aware
of
a
voice
at
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
done
,
young
married
volk
!
I
could
n't
have
carried
it
out
much
*NL*
better
myself
,
cuss
me
if
I
could
!
''
The
voice
,
which
was
husky
,
*NL*
came
from
the
garden-gate
,
and
looking
up
from
the
scene
of
slaughter
*NL*
they
saw
the
burly
form
of
Mr.
Challow
leaning
over
the
gate
,
*NL*
critically
surveying
their
performance
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
well
for
`
ee
to
stand
there
and
glane
!
''
said
Arabella
.
``
Owing
*NL*
to
your
being
late
the
meat
is
blooded
and
half
spoiled
!
`
Two
n't
*NL*
fetch
so
much
by
a
shilling
a
score
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Challow
expressed
his
contrition
.
``
You
should
have
waited
a
bit
''
*NL*
he
said
,
shaking
his
head
,
``
and
not
have
done
this
--
in
the
delicate
*NL*
state
,
too
,
that
you
be
in
at
present
,
ma'am
.
'T
is
risking
yourself
*NL*
too
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
need
n't
be
concerned
about
that
,
''
said
Arabella
,
laughing
.
*NL*
Jude
too
laughed
,
but
there
was
a
strong
flavour
of
bitterness
in
*NL*
his
amusement
.
*NL*
*NL*
Challow
made
up
for
his
neglect
of
the
killing
by
zeal
in
the
*NL*
scalding
and
scraping
.
Jude
felt
dissatisfied
with
himself
as
a
man
*NL*
at
what
he
had
done
,
though
aware
of
his
lack
of
common
sense
,
and
*NL*
that
the
deed
would
have
amounted
to
the
same
thing
if
carried
out
by
*NL*
deputy
.
The
white
snow
,
stained
with
the
blood
of
his
fellow-mortal
,
*NL*
wore
an
illogical
look
to
him
as
a
lover
of
justice
,
not
to
say
a
*NL*
Christian
;
but
he
could
not
see
how
the
matter
was
to
be
mended
.
No
*NL*
doubt
he
was
,
as
his
wife
had
called
him
,
a
tender-hearted
fool
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
like
the
road
to
Alfredston
now
.
It
stared
him
cynically
*NL*
in
the
face
.
The
wayside
objects
reminded
him
so
much
of
his
*NL*
courtship
of
his
wife
that
,
to
keep
them
out
of
his
eyes
,
he
*NL*
read
whenever
he
could
as
he
walked
to
and
from
his
work
.
Yet
*NL*
he
sometimes
felt
that
by
caring
for
books
he
was
not
escaping
*NL*
common-place
nor
gaining
rare
ideas
,
every
working-man
being
of
that
*NL*
taste
now
.
When
passing
near
the
spot
by
the
stream
on
which
he
had
*NL*
first
made
her
acquaintance
he
one
day
heard
voices
just
as
he
had
*NL*
done
at
that
earlier
time
.
One
of
the
girls
who
had
been
Arabella
's
*NL*
companions
was
talking
to
a
friend
in
a
shed
,
himself
being
the
*NL*
subject
of
discourse
,
possibly
because
they
had
seen
him
in
the
*NL*
distance
.
They
were
quite
unaware
that
the
shed-walls
were
so
thin
*NL*
that
he
could
hear
their
words
as
he
passed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Howsomever
,
't
was
I
put
her
up
to
it
!
`
Nothing
venture
nothing
*NL*
have
,
'
I
said
.
If
I
had
n't
she
'd
no
more
have
been
his
mis
`
ess
than
*NL*
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
my
belief
she
knew
there
was
nothing
the
matter
when
she
told
*NL*
him
she
was
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
had
Arabella
been
put
up
to
by
this
woman
,
so
that
he
should
*NL*
make
her
his
``
mis
`
ess
,
''
otherwise
wife
?
The
suggestion
was
horridly
*NL*
unpleasant
,
and
it
rankled
in
his
mind
so
much
that
instead
of
*NL*
entering
his
own
cottage
when
he
reached
it
he
flung
his
basket
*NL*
inside
the
garden-gate
and
passed
on
,
determined
to
go
and
see
his
*NL*
old
aunt
and
get
some
supper
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
made
his
arrival
home
rather
late
.
Arabella
however
,
was
busy
*NL*
melting
down
lard
from
fat
of
the
deceased
pig
,
for
she
had
been
out
*NL*
on
a
jaunt
all
day
,
and
so
delayed
her
work
.
Dreading
lest
what
he
*NL*
had
heard
should
lead
him
to
say
something
regrettable
to
her
he
*NL*
spoke
little
.
But
Arabella
was
very
talkative
,
and
said
among
other
*NL*
things
that
she
wanted
some
money
.
Seeing
the
book
sticking
out
of
*NL*
his
pocket
she
added
that
he
ought
to
earn
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
apprentice
's
wages
are
not
meant
to
be
enough
to
keep
a
wife
on
,
*NL*
as
a
rule
,
my
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
should
n't
have
had
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
Arabella
!
That
's
too
bad
,
when
you
know
how
it
came
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
declare
afore
Heaven
that
I
thought
what
I
told
you
was
true
.
*NL*
Doctor
Vilbert
thought
so
.
It
was
a
good
job
for
you
that
it
was
n't
*NL*
so
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
mean
that
,
''
he
said
hastily
.
``
I
mean
before
that
time
.
*NL*
I
know
it
was
not
your
fault
;
but
those
women
friends
of
yours
gave
*NL*
you
bad
advice
.
If
they
had
n't
,
or
you
had
n't
taken
it
,
we
should
at
*NL*
this
moment
have
been
free
from
a
bond
which
,
not
to
mince
matters
,
*NL*
galls
both
of
us
devilishly
.
It
may
be
very
sad
,
but
it
is
true
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
been
telling
you
about
my
friends
?
What
advice
?
I
insist
*NL*
upon
you
telling
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pooh
--
I
'd
rather
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
shall
--
you
ought
to
.
It
is
mean
of
`
ee
not
to
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
.
''
And
he
hinted
gently
what
had
been
revealed
to
him
.
*NL*
``
But
I
do
n't
wish
to
dwell
upon
it
.
Let
us
say
no
more
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
defensive
manner
collapsed
.
``
That
was
nothing
,
''
she
said
,
*NL*
laughing
coldly
.
``
Every
woman
has
a
right
to
do
such
as
that
.
The
*NL*
risk
is
hers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
quite
deny
it

might
if
no
lifelong
penalty
attached
*NL*
to
it
for
the
man

or
,
in
his
default
,
for
herself
;
if
the
weakness
*NL*
of
the
moment
could
end
with
the
moment
,
or
even
with
the
year
.
*NL*
But
when
effects
stretch
so
far
she
should
not
go
and
do
that
which
*NL*
entraps
a
man
if
he
is
honest
,
or
herself
if
he
is
otherwise

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
ought
I
to
have
done
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Given
me
time
...
Why
do
you

yourself
about
melting
down
that

pig

fat
to-night

put
it
away
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
must
do
it
to-morrow
morning

It
wo

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Next
morning
,
which
was
Sunday
,
she
resumed
operations
about
ten
*NL*
o'clock
;
and
the
renewed
work
recalled
the
conversation
which
had
*NL*
accompanied
it
the
night
before
,
and
put
her
back
into
the
same
*NL*
intractable
temper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
story
about
me
in
Marygreen
,
is
it
--
that
I
entrapped
`
ee
?
*NL*
Much
of
a
catch
you
were
,
Lord
send
!
''
As
she
warmed
she
saw
some
of
*NL*
Jude
's
dear
ancient
classics
on
a
table
where
they
ought
not
to
have
*NL*
been
laid
.
``
I
wo
n't
have
them
books
here
in
the
way
!
''
she
cried
*NL*
petulantly
;
and
seizing
them
one
by
one
she
began
throwing
them
upon
*NL*
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
my
books
alone
!
''
he
said
.
``
You
might
have
thrown
them
*NL*
aside
if
you
had
liked
,
but
as
to
soiling
them
like
that
,
it
is
*NL*
disgusting
!
''
In
the
operation
of
making
lard
Arabella
's
hands
had
*NL*
become
smeared
with
the
hot
grease
,
and
her
fingers
consequently
*NL*
left
very
perceptible
imprints
on
the
book-covers
.
She
continued
*NL*
deliberately
to
toss
the
books
severally
upon
the
floor
,
till
Jude
,
*NL*
incensed
beyond
bearing
,
caught
her
by
the
arms
to
make
her
leave
*NL*
off
.
Somehow
,
in
going
so
,
he
loosened
the
fastening
of
her
hair
,
*NL*
and
it
rolled
about
her
ears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
go
!
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Promise
to
leave
the
books
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
hesitated
.
``
Let
me
go
!
''
she
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Promise
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
pause
:
``
I
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
relinquished
his
hold
,
and
she
crossed
the
room
to
the
door
,
*NL*
out
of
which
she
went
with
a
set
face
,
and
into
the
highway
.
Here
*NL*
she
began
to
saunter
up
and
down
,
perversely
pulling
her
hair
into
a
*NL*
worse
disorder
than
he
had
caused
,
and
unfastening
several
buttons
of
*NL*
her
gown
.
It
was
a
fine
Sunday
morning
,
dry
,
clear
and
frosty
,
and
*NL*
the
bells
of
Alfredston
Church
could
be
heard
on
the
breeze
from
the
*NL*
north
.
People
were
going
along
the
road
,
dressed
in
their
holiday
*NL*
clothes
;
they
were
mainly
lovers
--
such
pairs
as
Jude
and
Arabella
*NL*
had
been
when
they
sported
along
the
same
track
some
months
earlier
.
*NL*
These
pedestrians
turned
to
stare
at
the
extraordinary
spectacle
she
*NL*
now
presented
,
bonnetless
,
her
dishevelled
hair
blowing
in
the
wind
,
*NL*
her
bodice
apart
,
her
sleeves
rolled
above
her
elbows
for
her
work
,
*NL*
and
her
hands
reeking
with
melted
fat
.
One
of
the
passers
said
in
*NL*
mock
terror
:
``
Good
Lord
deliver
us
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
how
he
's
served
me
!
''
she
cried
.
``
Making
me
work
Sunday
mornings
*NL*
when
I
ought
to
be
going
to
my
church
,
and
tearing
my
hair
off
my
*NL*
head
,
and
my
gown
off
my
back
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
was
exasperated
,
and
went
out
to
drag
her
in
by
main
force
.
*NL*
Then
he
suddenly
lost
his
heat
.
Illuminated
with
the
sense
that
all
*NL*
was
over
between
them
,
and
that
it
mattered
not
what
she
did
,
or
he
,
*NL*
her
husband
stood
still
,
regarding
her
.
Their
lives
were
ruined
,
he
*NL*
thought
;
ruined
by
the
fundamental
error
of
their
matrimonial
union
:
*NL*
that
of
having
based
a
permanent
contract
on
a
temporary
feeling
*NL*
which
had
no
necessary
connection
with
affinities
that
alone
render
*NL*
a
lifelong
comradeship
tolerable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Going
to
ill-use
me
on
principle
,
as
your
father
ill-used
your
*NL*
mother
,
and
your
father
's
sister
ill-used
her
husband
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
``
All
you
be
a
queer
lot
as
husbands
and
wives
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
fixed
an
arrested
,
surprised
look
on
her
.
But
she
said
no
more
,
*NL*
and
continued
her
saunter
till
she
was
tired
.
He
left
the
spot
,
and
,
*NL*
after
wandering
vaguely
a
little
while
,
walked
in
the
direction
of
*NL*
Marygreen
.
Here
he
called
upon
his
great-aunt
,
whose
infirmities
*NL*
daily
increased
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aunt
--
did
my
father
ill-use
my
mother
,
and
my
aunt
her
husband
?
''
*NL*
said
Jude
abruptly
,
sitting
down
by
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
raised
her
ancient
eyes
under
the
rim
of
the
by-gone
bonnet
that
*NL*
she
always
wore
.
``
Who
's
been
telling
you
that
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
heard
it
spoken
of
,
and
want
to
know
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
med
so
well

I
s
`
pose

though
your
wife
--
I
reckon
't
was
*NL*
she
--
must
have
been
a
fool
to
open
up
that
!
There
is
n't
much
to
know
*NL*
after
all
.
Your
father
and
mother
could
n't
get
on
together
,
and
they
*NL*
parted
.
It
was
coming
home
from
Alfredston
market
,
when
you
were
a
*NL*
baby
--
on
the
hill
by
the
Brown
House
barn
--
that
they
had
their
last
*NL*
difference
,
and
took
leave
of
one
another
for
the
last
time
.
Your
*NL*
mother
soon
afterwards
died
--
she
drowned
herself
,
in
short
,
and
your
*NL*
father
went
away
with
you
to
South
Wessex
,
and
never
came
here
any
*NL*
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
recalled
his
father
's
silence
about
North
Wessex
and
Jude
's
*NL*
mother
,
never
speaking
of
either
till
his
dying
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
the
same
with
your
father
's
sister
.
Her
husband
offended
*NL*
her
,
and
she
so
disliked
living
with
him
afterwards
that
she
went
*NL*
away
to
London
with
her
little
maid
.
The
Fawleys
were
not
made
for
*NL*
wedlock
:
it
never
seemed
to
sit
well
upon
us
.
There
's
sommat
in
our
*NL*
blood
that
wo
n't
take
kindly
to
the
notion
of
being
bound
to
do
what
*NL*
we
do
readily
enough
if
not
bound
.
That
's
why
you
ought
to
have
*NL*
hearkened
to
me
,
and
not
ha

married

But

*NL*
In
the
dusk
of
that
evening
Jude
walked
away
from
his
old
aunt
's
as
*NL*
if
to
go
home
.
But
as
soon
as
he
reached
the
open
down
he
struck
out
*NL*
upon
it
till
he
came
to
a
large
round
pond
.
The
frost
continued
,
*NL*
though
it
was
not
particularly
sharp
,
and
the
larger
stars
overhead
*NL*
came
out
slow
and
flickering
.
Jude
put
one
foot
on
the
edge
of
the
*NL*
ice
,
and
then
the
other
:
it
cracked
under
his
weight
;
but
this
did
*NL*
not
deter
him
.
He
ploughed
his
way
inward
to
the
centre
,
the
ice
*NL*
making
sharp
noises
as
he
went
.
When
just
about
the
middle
he
looked
*NL*
around
him
and
gave
a
jump
.
The
cracking
repeated
itself
;
but
he
did
*NL*
not
go
down
.
He
jumped
again
,
but
the
cracking
had
ceased
.
Jude
*NL*
went
back
to
the
edge
,
and
stepped
upon
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
curious
,
he
thought
.
What
was
he
reserved
for
?
He
supposed
*NL*
he
was
not
a
sufficiently
dignified
person
for
suicide
.
Peaceful
*NL*
death
abhorred
him
as
a
subject
,
and
would
not
take
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
could
he
do
of
a
lower
kind
than
self-extermination
;
what
was
*NL*
there
less
noble
,
more
in
keeping
with
his
present
degraded
position
?
*NL*
He
could
get
drunk
.
Of
course
that
was
it
;
he
had
forgotten
.
*NL*
Drinking
was
the
regular
,
stereotyped
resource
of
the
despairing
*NL*
worthless
.
He
began
to
see
now
why
some
men
boozed
at
inns
.
He
*NL*
struck
down
the
hill
northwards
and
came
to
an
obscure
public-house
.
*NL*
On
entering
and
sitting
down
the
sight
of
the
picture
of
Samson
and
*NL*
Delilah
on
the
wall
caused
him
to
recognize
the
place
as
that
he
*NL*
had
visited
with
Arabella
on
that
first
Sunday
evening
of
their
*NL*
courtship
.
He
called
for
liquor
and
drank
briskly
for
an
hour
or
*NL*
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
Staggering
homeward
late
that
night
,
with
all
his
sense
of
*NL*
depression
gone
,
and
his
head
fairly
clear
still
,
he
began
to
laugh
*NL*
boisterously
,
and
to
wonder
how
Arabella
would
receive
him
in
his
*NL*
new
aspect
.
The
house
was
in
darkness
when
he
entered
,
and
in
*NL*
his
stumbling
state
it
was
some
time
before
he
could
get
a
light
.
*NL*
Then
he
found
that
,
though
the
marks
of
pig-dressing
,
of
fats
and
*NL*
scallops
,
were
visible
,
the
materials
themselves
had
been
taken
away
.
*NL*
A
line
written
by
his
wife
on
the
inside
of
an
old
envelope
was
*NL*
pinned
to
the
cotton
blower
of
the
fireplace
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Have
gone
to
my
friends
.
Shall
not
return
.
_
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
next
day
he
remained
at
home
,
and
sent
off
the
carcase
of
the
*NL*
pig
to
Alfredston
.
He
then
cleaned
up
the
premises
,
locked
the
door
,
*NL*
put
the
key
in
a
place
she
would
know
if
she
came
back
,
and
returned
*NL*
to
his
masonry
at
Alfredston
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
night
when
he
again
plodded
home
he
found
she
had
not
visited
the
*NL*
house
.
The
next
day
went
in
the
same
way
,
and
the
next
.
Then
there
*NL*
came
a
letter
from
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
she
had
gone
tired
of
him
she
frankly
admitted
.
He
was
such
*NL*
a
slow
old
coach
,
and
she
did
not
care
for
the
sort
of
life
he
*NL*
led
.
There
was
no
prospect
of
his
ever
bettering
himself
or
her
.
*NL*
She
further
went
on
to
say
that
her
parents
had
,
as
he
knew
,
for
*NL*
some
time
considered
the
question
of
emigrating
to
Australia
,
the
*NL*
pig-jobbing
business
being
a
poor
one
nowadays
.
They
had
at
last
*NL*
decided
to
go
,
and
she
proposed
to
go
with
them
,
if
he
had
no
*NL*
objection
.
A
woman
of
her
sort
would
have
more
chance
over
there
*NL*
than
in
this
stupid
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
replied
that
he
had
not
the
least
objection
to
her
going
.
He
*NL*
thought
it
a
wise
course
,
since
she
wished
to
go
,
and
one
that
might
*NL*
be
to
the
advantage
of
both
.
He
enclosed
in
the
packet
containing
*NL*
the
letter
the
money
that
had
been
realized
by
the
sale
of
the
pig
,
*NL*
with
all
he
had
besides
,
which
was
not
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
that
day
he
heard
no
more
of
her
except
indirectly
,
though
her
*NL*
father
and
his
household
did
not
immediately
leave
,
but
waited
till
*NL*
his
goods
and
other
effects
had
been
sold
off
.
When
Jude
learnt
*NL*
that
there
was
to
be
an
auction
at
the
house
of
the
Donns
he
packed
*NL*
his
own
household
goods
into
a
waggon
,
and
sent
them
to
her
at
the
*NL*
aforesaid
homestead
,
that
she
might
sell
them
with
the
rest
,
or
as
*NL*
many
of
them
as
she
should
choose
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
then
went
into
lodgings
at
Alfredston
,
and
saw
in
a
shopwindow
the
*NL*
little
handbill
announcing
the
sale
of
his
father-in-law
's
furniture
.
*NL*
He
noted
its
date
,
which
came
and
passed
without
Jude
's
going
near
*NL*
the
place
,
or
perceiving
that
the
traffic
out
of
Alfredston
by
*NL*
the
southern
road
was
materially
increased
by
the
auction
.
A
few
*NL*
days
later
he
entered
a
dingy
broker
's
shop
in
the
main
street
*NL*
of
the
town
,
and
amid
a
heterogeneous
collection
of
saucepans
,
a
*NL*
clothes-horse
,
rolling-pin
,
brass
candlestick
,
swing
looking-glass
,
*NL*
and
other
things
at
the
back
of
the
shop
,
evidently
just
brought
in
*NL*
from
a
sale
,
he
perceived
a
framed
photograph
,
which
turned
out
to
be
*NL*
his
own
portrait
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
one
which
he
had
had
specially
taken
and
framed
by
a
local
man
*NL*
in
bird
's
-
eye
maple
,
as
a
present
for
Arabella
,
and
had
duly
given
*NL*
her
on
their
wedding-day
.
On
the
back
was
still
to
be
read
,
''
_
Jude
*NL*
to
Arabella
_
,
''
with
the
date
.
She
must
have
thrown
it
in
with
the
*NL*
rest
of
her
property
at
the
auction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
said
the
broker
,
seeing
him
look
at
this
and
the
other
articles
*NL*
in
the
heap
,
and
not
perceiving
that
the
portrait
was
of
himself
,
*NL*
``
It
is
a
small
lot
of
stuff
that
was
knocked
down
to
me
at
a
cottage
*NL*
sale
out
on
the
road
to
Marygreen
.
The
frame
is
a
very
useful
one
,
*NL*
if
you
take
out
the
likeness
.
You
shall
have
it
for
a
shilling
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
utter
death
of
every
tender
sentiment
in
his
wife
,
as
brought
*NL*
home
to
him
by
this
mute
and
undesigned
evidence
of
her
sale
of
*NL*
his
portrait
and
gift
,
was
the
conclusive
little
stroke
required
*NL*
to
demolish
all
sentiment
in
him
.
He
paid
the
shilling
,
took
the
*NL*
photograph
away
with
him
,
and
burnt
it
,
frame
and
all
,
when
he
*NL*
reached
his
lodging
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
or
three
days
later
he
heard
that
Arabella
and
her
parents
had
*NL*
departed
.
He
had
sent
a
message
offering
to
see
her
for
a
formal
*NL*
leave-taking
,
but
she
had
said
that
it
would
be
better
otherwise
,
*NL*
since
she
was
bent
on
going
,
which
perhaps
was
true
.
On
the
evening
*NL*
following
their
emigration
,
when
his
day
's
work
was
done
,
he
came
out
*NL*
of
doors
after
supper
,
and
strolled
in
the
starlight
along
the
too
*NL*
familiar
road
towards
the
upland
whereon
had
been
experienced
the
*NL*
chief
emotions
of
his
life
.
It
seemed
to
be
his
own
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
realize
himself
.
On
the
old
track
he
seemed
to
be
a
*NL*
boy
still
,
hardly
a
day
older
than
when
he
had
stood
dreaming
at
the
*NL*
top
of
that
hill
,
inwardly
fired
for
the
first
time
with
ardours
for
*NL*
Christminster
and
scholarship
.
``
Yet
I
am
a
man
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
have
*NL*
a
wife
.
More
,
I
have
arrived
at
the
still
riper
stage
of
having
*NL*
disagreed
with
her
,
disliked
her
,
had
a
scuffle
with
her
,
and
parted
*NL*
from
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
remembered
then
that
he
was
standing
not
far
from
the
spot
at
*NL*
which
the
parting
between
his
father
and
his
mother
was
said
to
have
*NL*
occurred
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
little
further
on
was
the
summit
whence
Christminster
,
or
what
he
*NL*
had
taken
for
that
city
,
had
seemed
to
be
visible
.
A
milestone
,
now
*NL*
as
always
,
stood
at
the
roadside
hard
by
.
Jude
drew
near
it
,
and
*NL*
felt
rather
than
read
the
mileage
to
the
city
.
He
remembered
that
*NL*
once
on
his
way
home
he
had
proudly
cut
with
his
keen
new
chisel
an
*NL*
inscription
on
the
back
of
that
milestone
,
embodying
his
aspirations
.
*NL*
It
had
been
done
in
the
first
week
of
his
apprenticeship
,
before
*NL*
he
had
been
diverted
from
his
purposes
by
an
unsuitable
woman
.
He
*NL*
wondered
if
the
inscription
were
legible
still
,
and
going
to
the
back
*NL*
of
the
milestone
brushed
away
the
nettles
.
By
the
light
of
a
match
*NL*
he
could
still
discern
what
he
had
cut
so
enthusiastically
so
long
*NL*
ago
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
THITHER
*NL*
J.
F.
*NL*
-LSB-
with
a
pointing
finger
-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
sight
of
it
,
unimpaired
,
within
its
screen
of
grass
and
nettles
,
*NL*
lit
in
his
soul
a
spark
of
the
old
fire
.
Surely
his
plan
should
*NL*
be
to
move
onward
through
good
and
ill
--
to
avoid
morbid
sorrow
*NL*
even
though
he
did
see
uglinesses
in
the
world
?
_
Bene
agere

*NL*
loetari
_
--
to
do
good
cheerfully
--
which
he
had
heard
to
be
the
*NL*
philosophy
of
one
Spinoza
,
might
be
his
own
even
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
might
battle
with
his
evil
star
,
and
follow
out
his
original
*NL*
intention
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
moving
to
a
spot
a
little
way
off
he
uncovered
the
horizon
in
a
*NL*
north-easterly
direction
.
There
actually
rose
the
faint
halo
,
a
*NL*
small
dim
nebulousness
,
hardly
recognizable
save
by
the
eye
of
faith
.
*NL*
It
was
enough
for
him
.
He
would
go
to
Christminster
as
soon
as
the
*NL*
term
of
his
apprenticeship
expired
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
returned
to
his
lodgings
in
a
better
mood
,
and
said
his
prayers

The
next
noteworthy
move
in
Jude
's
life
was
that
in
which
he
appeared
*NL*
gliding
steadily
onward
through
a
dusky
landscape
of
some
three
*NL*
years
'
later
leafage
than
had
graced
his
courtship
of
Arabella
,
*NL*
and
the
disruption
of
his
coarse
conjugal
life
with
her
.
He
was
*NL*
walking
towards
Christminster
City
,
at
a
point
a
mile
or
two
to
the
*NL*
south-west
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
at
last
found
himself
clear
of
Marygreen
and
Alfredston
:
he
*NL*
was
out
of
his
apprenticeship
,
and
with
his
tools
at
his
back
seemed
*NL*
to
be
in
the
way
of
making
a
new
start
--
the
start
to
which
,
barring
*NL*
the
interruption
involved
in
his
intimacy
and
married
experience
with
*NL*
Arabella
,
he
had
been
looking
forward
for
about
ten
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
would
now
have
been
described
as
a
young
man
with
a
forcible
,
*NL*
meditative
,
and
earnest
rather
than
handsome
cast
of
countenance
.
*NL*
He
was
of
dark
complexion
,
with
dark
harmonizing
eyes
,
and
he
wore
*NL*
a
closely
trimmed
black
beard
of
more
advanced
growth
than
is
usual
*NL*
at
his
age
;
this
,
with
his
great
mass
of
black
curly
hair
,
was
some
*NL*
trouble
to
him
in
combing
and
washing
out
the
stone-dust
that
settled
*NL*
on
it
in
the
pursuit
of
his
trade
.
His
capabilities
in
the
latter
,
*NL*
having
been
acquired
in
the
country
,
were
of
an
all-round
sort
,
*NL*
including
monumental
stone-cutting
,
gothic
free-stone
work
for
the
*NL*
restoration
of
churches
,
and
carving
of
a
general
kind
.
In
London
*NL*
he
would
probably
have
become
specialized
and
have
made
himself
a
*NL*
``
moulding
mason
,
''
a
``
foliage
sculptor
''
--
perhaps
a
``
statuary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
that
afternoon
driven
in
a
cart
from
Alfredston
to
the
village
*NL*
nearest
the
city
in
this
direction
,
and
was
now
walking
the
remaining
*NL*
four
miles
rather
from
choice
than
from
necessity
,
having
always
*NL*
fancied
himself
arriving
thus
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ultimate
impulse
to
come
had
had
a
curious
origin
--
one
more
*NL*
nearly
related
to
the
emotional
side
of
him
than
to
the
intellectual
,
*NL*
as
is
often
the
case
with
young
men
.
One
day
while
in
lodgings
at
*NL*
Alfredston
he
had
gone
to
Marygreen
to
see
his
old
aunt
,
and
had
*NL*
observed
between
the
brass
candlesticks
on
her
mantlepiece
the
*NL*
photograph
of
a
pretty
girlish
face
,
in
a
broad
hat
with
radiating
*NL*
folds
under
the
brim
like
the
rays
of
a
halo
.
He
had
asked
who
she
*NL*
was
.
His
grand-aunt
had
gruffly
replied
that
she
was
his
cousin
*NL*
Sue
Bridehead
,
of
the
inimical
branch
of
the
family
;
and
on
further
*NL*
questioning
the
old
woman
had
replied
that
the
girl
lived
in
*NL*
Christminster
,
though
she
did
not
know
where
,
or
what
she
was
doing
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
aunt
would
not
give
him
the
photograph
.
But
it
haunted
him
;
and
*NL*
ultimately
formed
a
quickening
ingredient
in
his
latent
intent
of
*NL*
following
his
friend
the
school
master
thither
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
now
paused
at
the
top
of
a
crooked
and
gentle
declivity
,
*NL*
and
obtained
his
first
near
view
of
the
city
.
Grey-stoned
and
*NL*
dun-roofed
,
it
stood
within
hail
of
the
Wessex
border
,
and
almost
*NL*
with
the
tip
of
one
small
toe
within
it
,
at
the
northernmost
point
of
*NL*
the
crinkled
line
along
which
the
leisurely
Thames
strokes
the
fields
*NL*
of
that
ancient
kingdom
.
The
buildings
now
lay
quiet
in
the
sunset
,
*NL*
a
vane
here
and
there
on
their
many
spires
and
domes
giving
sparkle
*NL*
to
a
picture
of
sober
secondary
and
tertiary
hues
.
*NL*
*NL*
Reaching
the
bottom
he
moved
along
the
level
way
between
pollard
*NL*
willows
growing
indistinct
in
the
twilight
,
and
soon
confronted
the
*NL*
outmost
lamps
of
the
town
--
some
of
those
lamps
which
had
sent
into
*NL*
the
sky
the
gleam
and
glory
that
caught
his
strained
gaze
in
his
days
*NL*
of
dreaming
,
so
many
years
ago
.
They
winked
their
yellow
eyes
at
him
*NL*
dubiously
,
and
as
if
,
though
they
had
been
awaiting
him
all
these
*NL*
years
in
disappointment
at
his
tarrying
,
they
did
not
much
want
him
*NL*
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
species
of
Dick
Whittington
whose
spirit
was
touched
to
*NL*
finer
issues
than
a
mere
material
gain
.
He
went
along
the
outlying
*NL*
streets
with
the
cautious
tread
of
an
explorer
.
He
saw
nothing
of
*NL*
the
real
city
in
the
suburbs
on
this
side
.
His
first
want
being
a
*NL*
lodging
he
scrutinized
carefully
such
localities
as
seemed
to
offer
*NL*
on
inexpensive
terms
the
modest
type
of
accommodation
he
demanded
;
*NL*
and
after
inquiry
took
a
room
in
a
suburb
nicknamed
``
Beersheba
,
''
*NL*
though
he
did
not
know
this
at
the
time
.
Here
he
installed
himself
,
*NL*
and
having
had
some
tea
sallied
forth
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
windy
,
whispering
,
moonless
night
.
To
guide
himself
he
*NL*
opened
under
a
lamp
a
map
he
had
brought
.
The
breeze
ruffled
and
*NL*
fluttered
it
,
but
he
could
see
enough
to
decide
on
the
direction
he
*NL*
should
take
to
reach
the
heart
of
the
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
many
turnings
he
came
up
to
the
first
ancient
mediaeval
pile
*NL*
that
he
had
encountered
.
It
was
a
college
,
as
he
could
see
by
the
*NL*
gateway
.
He
entered
it
,
walked
round
,
and
penetrated
to
dark
corners
*NL*
which
no
lamplight
reached
.
Close
to
this
college
was
another
;
and
*NL*
a
little
further
on
another
;
and
then
he
began
to
be
encircled
as
it
*NL*
were
with
the
breath
and
sentiment
of
the
venerable
city
.
When
he
*NL*
passed
objects
out
of
harmony
with
its
general
expression
he
allowed
*NL*
his
eyes
to
slip
over
them
as
if
he
did
not
see
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
bell
began
clanging
,
and
he
listened
till
a
hundred-and-one
strokes
*NL*
had
sounded
.
He
must
have
made
a
mistake
,
he
thought
:
it
was
meant
*NL*
for
a
hundred
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
gates
were
shut
,
and
he
could
no
longer
get
into
the
*NL*
quadrangles
,
he
rambled
under
the
walls
and
doorways
,
feeling
with
*NL*
his
fingers
the
contours
of
their
mouldings
and
carving
.
The
minutes
*NL*
passed
,
fewer
and
fewer
people
were
visible
,
and
still
he
serpentined
*NL*
among
the
shadows
,
for
had
he
not
imagined
these
scenes
through
*NL*
ten
bygone
years
,
and
what
mattered
a
night
's
rest
for
once
?
High
*NL*
against
the
black
sky
the
flash
of
a
lamp
would
show
crocketed
*NL*
pinnacles
and
indented
battlements
.
Down
obscure
alleys
,
apparently
*NL*
never
trodden
now
by
the
foot
of
man
,
and
whose
very
existence
seemed
*NL*
to
be
forgotten
,
there
would
jut
into
the
path
porticoes
,
oriels
,
*NL*
doorways
of
enriched
and
florid
middle-age
design
,
their
extinct
air
*NL*
being
accentuated
by
the
rottenness
of
the
stones
.
It
seemed
*NL*
impossible
that
modern
thought
could
house
itself
in
such
decrepit
*NL*
and
superseded
chambers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Knowing
not
a
human
being
here
,
Jude
began
to
be
impressed
with
*NL*
the
isolation
of
his
own
personality
,
as
with
a
self-spectre
,
the
*NL*
sensation
being
that
of
one
who
walked
but
could
not
make
himself
*NL*
seen
or
heard
.
He
drew
his
breath
pensively
,
and
,
seeming
thus
*NL*
almost
his
own
ghost
,
gave
his
thoughts
to
the
other
ghostly
*NL*
presences
with
which
the
nooks
were
haunted
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
interval
of
preparation
for
this
venture
,
since
his
wife
*NL*
and
furniture
's
uncompromising
disappearance
into
space
,
he
had
read
*NL*
and
learnt
almost
all
that
could
be
read
and
learnt
by
one
in
his
*NL*
position
,
of
the
worthies
who
had
spent
their
youth
within
these
*NL*
reverend
walls
,
and
whose
souls
had
haunted
them
in
their
maturer
*NL*
age
.
Some
of
them
,
by
the
accidents
of
his
reading
,
loomed
out
in
*NL*
his
fancy
disproportionately
large
by
comparison
with
the
rest
.
The
*NL*
brushings
of
the
wind
against
the
angles
,
buttresses
,
and
door-jambs
*NL*
were
as
the
passing
of
these
only
other
inhabitants
,
the
tappings
*NL*
of
each
ivy
leaf
on
its
neighbour
were
as
the
mutterings
of
their
*NL*
mournful
souls
,
the
shadows
as
their
thin
shapes
in
nervous
movement
,
*NL*
making
him
comrades
in
his
solitude
.
In
the
gloom
it
was
as
if
he
*NL*
ran
against
them
without
feeling
their
bodily
frames
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
streets
were
now
deserted
,
but
on
account
of
these
things
he
*NL*
could
not
go
in
.
There
were
poets
abroad
,
of
early
date
and
of
late
,
*NL*
from
the
friend
and
eulogist
of
Shakespeare
down
to
him
who
has
*NL*
recently
passed
into
silence
,
and
that
musical
one
of
the
tribe
who
*NL*
is
still
among
us
.
Speculative
philosophers
drew
along
,
not
always
*NL*
with
wrinkled
foreheads
and
hoary
hair
as
in
framed
portraits
,
but
*NL*
pink-faced
,
slim
,
and
active
as
in
youth
;
modern
divines
sheeted
in
*NL*
their
surplices
,
among
whom
the
most
real
to
Jude
Fawley
were
the
*NL*
founders
of
the
religious
school
called
Tractarian
;
the
well-known
*NL*
three
,
the
enthusiast
,
the
poet
,
and
the
formularist
,
the
echoes
*NL*
of
whose
teachings
had
influenced
him
even
in
his
obscure
home
.
*NL*
A
start
of
aversion
appeared
in
his
fancy
to
move
them
at
sight
of
*NL*
those
other
sons
of
the
place
,
the
form
in
the
full-bottomed
wig
,
*NL*
statesman
,
rake
,
reasoner
,
and
sceptic
;
the
smoothly
shaven
historian
*NL*
so
ironically
civil
to
Christianity
;
with
others
of
the
same
*NL*
incredulous
temper
,
who
knew
each
quad
as
well
as
the
faithful
,
and
*NL*
took
equal
freedom
in
haunting
its
cloisters
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
regarded
the
statesmen
in
their
various
types
,
men
of
firmer
*NL*
movement
and
less
dreamy
air
;
the
scholar
,
the
speaker
,
the
plodder
;
*NL*
the
man
whose
mind
grew
with
his
growth
in
years
,
and
the
man
whose
*NL*
mind
contracted
with
the
same
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
scientists
and
philologists
followed
on
in
his
mind-sight
in
*NL*
an
odd
impossible
combination
,
men
of
meditative
faces
,
strained
*NL*
foreheads
,
and
weak-eyed
as
bats
with
constant
research
;
*NL*
then
official
characters
--
such
men
as
governor-generals
and
*NL*
lord-lieutenants
,
in
whom
he
took
little
interest
;
chief-justices
and
*NL*
lord
chancellors
,
silent
thin-lipped
figures
of
whom
he
knew
barely
*NL*
the
names
.
A
keener
regard
attached
to
the
prelates
,
by
reason
of
*NL*
his
own
former
hopes
.
Of
them
he
had
an
ample
band
--
some
men
of
*NL*
heart
,
others
rather
men
of
head
;
he
who
apologized
for
the
Church
*NL*
in
Latin
;
the
saintly
author
of
the
Evening
Hymn
;
and
near
them
the
*NL*
great
itinerant
preacher
,
hymn-writer
,
and
zealot
,
shadowed
like
Jude
*NL*
by
his
matrimonial
difficulties
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
found
himself
speaking
out
loud
,
holding
conversations
with
*NL*
them
as
it
were
,
like
an
actor
in
a
melodrama
who
apostrophizes
the
*NL*
audience
on
the
other
side
of
the
footlights
;
till
he
suddenly
ceased
*NL*
with
a
start
at
his
absurdity
.
Perhaps
those
incoherent
words
of
the
*NL*
wanderer
were
heard
within
the
walls
by
some
student
or
thinker
over
*NL*
his
lamp
;
and
he
may
have
raised
his
head
,
and
wondered
what
voice
it
*NL*
was
,
and
what
it
betokened
.
Jude
now
perceived
that
,
so
far
as
solid
*NL*
flesh
went
,
he
had
the
whole
aged
city
to
himself
with
the
exception
*NL*
of
a
belated
townsman
here
and
there
,
and
that
he
seemed
to
be
*NL*
catching
a
cold
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
voice
reached
him
out
of
the
shade
;
a
real
and
local
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
been
a-settin
'
a
long
time
on
that
plinth-stone
,
young
man
.
*NL*
What
med
you
be
up
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
came
from
a
policeman
who
had
been
observing
Jude
without
the
*NL*
latter
observing
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
went
home
and
to
bed
,
after
reading
up
a
little
about
these
men
*NL*
and
their
several
messages
to
the
world
from
a
book
or
two
that
he
*NL*
had
brought
with
him
concerning
the
sons
of
the
university
.
As
he
*NL*
drew
towards
sleep
various
memorable
words
of
theirs
that
he
had
*NL*
just
been
conning
seemed
spoken
by
them
in
muttering
utterances
;
*NL*
some
audible
,
some
unintelligible
to
him
.
One
of
the
spectres
-LRB-
who
*NL*
afterwards
mourned
Christminster
as
``
the
home
of
lost
causes
,
''
though
*NL*
Jude
did
not
remember
this
-RRB-
was
now
apostrophizing
her
thus
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Beautiful
city
!
so
venerable
,
so
lovely
,
so
unravaged
by
the
fierce
*NL*
intellectual
life
of
our
century
,
so
serene
!
...
Her
ineffable
charm
*NL*
keeps
ever
calling
us
to
the
true
goal
of
all
of
us
,
to
the
ideal
,
to
*NL*
perfection
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Another
voice
was
that
of
the
Corn
Law
convert
,
whose
phantom
he
had
*NL*
just
seen
in
the
quadrangle
with
a
great
bell
.
Jude
thought
his
soul
*NL*
might
have
been
shaping
the
historic
words
of
his
master-speech
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
I
may
be
wrong
,
but
my
impression
is
that
my
duty
towards
a
*NL*
country
threatened
with
famine
requires
that
that
which
has
been
the
*NL*
ordinary
remedy
under
all
similar
circumstances
should
be
resorted
to
*NL*
now
,
namely
,
that
there
should
be
free
access
to
the
food
of
man
from
*NL*
whatever
quarter
it
may
come
...
Deprive
me
of
office
to-morrow
,
you
*NL*
can
never
deprive
me
of
the
consciousness
that
I
have
exercised
the
*NL*
powers
committed
to
me
from
no
corrupt
or
interested
motives
,
from
no
*NL*
desire
to
gratify
ambition
,
for
no
personal
gain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
sly
author
of
the
immortal
Chapter
on
Christianity
:
``
How
*NL*
shall
we
excuse
the
supine
inattention
of
the
Pagan
and
philosophic
*NL*
world
,
to
those
evidences
-LSB-
miracles
-RSB-
which
were
presented
by
*NL*
Omnipotence
?
...
The
sages
of
Greece
and
Rome
turned
aside
from
the
*NL*
awful
spectacle
,
and
appeared
unconscious
of
any
alterations
in
the
*NL*
moral
or
physical
government
of
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
shade
of
the
poet
,
the
last
of
the
optimists
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
How
the
world
is
made
for
each
of
us
!
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
And
each
of
the
Many
helps
to
recruit
*NL*
The
life
of
the
race
by
a
general
plan
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Then
one
of
the
three
enthusiasts
he
had
seen
just
now
,
the
author
of
*NL*
the
_
Apologia
_
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
argument
was
...
that
absolute
certitude
as
to
the
truths
of
*NL*
natural
theology
was
the
result
of
an
assemblage
of
concurring
and
*NL*
converging
probabilities
...
that
probabilities
which
did
not
reach
*NL*
to
logical
certainty
might
create
a
mental
certitude
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
second
of
them
,
no
polemic
,
murmured
quieter
things
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Why
should
we
faint
,
and
fear
to
live
alone
,
*NL*
Since
all
alone
,
so
Heaven
has
will
'd
,
we
die
?
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
likewise
heard
some
phrases
spoken
by
the
phantom
with
the
short
*NL*
face
,
the
genial
Spectator
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
look
upon
the
tombs
of
the
great
,
every
motion
of
envy
dies
*NL*
in
me
;
when
I
read
the
epitaphs
of
the
beautiful
,
every
inordinate
*NL*
desire
goes
out
;
when
I
meet
with
the
grief
of
parents
upon
a
*NL*
tombstone
,
my
heart
melts
with
compassion
;
when
I
see
the
tombs
of
*NL*
the
parents
themselves
,
I
consider
the
vanity
of
grieving
for
those
*NL*
whom
we
must
quickly
follow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
lastly
a
gentle-voiced
prelate
spoke
,
during
whose
meek
,
familiar
*NL*
rhyme
,
endeared
to
him
from
earliest
childhood
,
Jude
fell
asleep
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Teach
me
to
live
,
that
I
may
dread
*NL*
The
grave
as
little
as
my
bed
.
*NL*
Teach
me
to
die
...
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
wake
till
morning
.
The
ghostly
past
seemed
to
have
gone
,
*NL*
and
everything
spoke
of
to-day
.
He
started
up
in
bed
,
thinking
he
*NL*
had
overslept
himself
and
then
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
Jove
--
I
had
quite
forgotten
my
sweet-faced
cousin
,
and
that
she
's
*NL*
here
all
the
time
!
...
and
my
old
schoolmaster
,
too
.
''
His
words
*NL*
about
his
schoolmaster
had
,
perhaps
,
less
zest
in
them
than
his
words
*NL*
concerning
his
cousin
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Necessary
meditations
on
the
actual
,
including
the
mean
*NL*
bread-and-cheese
question
,
dissipated
the
phantasmal
for
a
while
,
and
*NL*
compelled
Jude
to
smother
high
thinkings
under
immediate
needs
.
He
*NL*
had
to
get
up
,
and
seek
for
work
,
manual
work
;
the
only
kind
deemed
*NL*
by
many
of
its
professors
to
be
work
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Passing
out
into
the
streets
on
this
errand
he
found
that
the
*NL*
colleges
had
treacherously
changed
their
sympathetic
countenances
:
*NL*
some
were
pompous
;
some
had
put
on
the
look
of
family
vaults
above
*NL*
ground
;
something
barbaric
loomed
in
the
masonries
of
all
.
The
*NL*
spirits
of
the
great
men
had
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
numberless
architectural
pages
around
him
he
read
,
naturally
,
*NL*
less
as
an
artist-critic
of
their
forms
than
as
an
artizan
and
*NL*
comrade
of
the
dead
handicraftsmen
whose
muscles
had
actually
*NL*
executed
those
forms
.
He
examined
the
mouldings
,
stroked
them
as
*NL*
one
who
knew
their
beginning
,
said
they
were
difficult
or
easy
in
*NL*
the
working
,
had
taken
little
or
much
time
,
were
trying
to
the
arm
,
*NL*
or
convenient
to
the
tool
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
at
night
had
been
perfect
and
ideal
was
by
day
the
more
or
*NL*
less
defective
real
.
Cruelties
,
insults
,
had
,
he
perceived
,
been
*NL*
inflicted
on
the
aged
erections
.
The
condition
of
several
moved
him
*NL*
as
he
would
have
been
moved
by
maimed
sentient
beings
.
They
were
*NL*
wounded
,
broken
,
sloughing
off
their
outer
shape
in
the
deadly
*NL*
struggle
against
years
,
weather
,
and
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rottenness
of
these
historical
documents
reminded
him
that
he
was
*NL*
not
,
after
all
,
hastening
on
to
begin
the
morning
practically
as
he
*NL*
had
intended
.
He
had
come
to
work
,
and
to
live
by
work
,
and
the
*NL*
morning
had
nearly
gone
.
It
was
,
in
one
sense
,
encouraging
to
think
*NL*
that
in
a
place
of
crumbling
stones
there
must
be
plenty
for
one
of
*NL*
his
trade
to
do
in
the
business
of
renovation
.
He
asked
his
way
to
*NL*
the
workyard
of
the
stone-mason
whose
name
had
been
given
him
at
*NL*
Alfredston
;
and
soon
heard
the
familiar
sound
of
the
rubbers
and
*NL*
chisels
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
yard
was
a
little
centre
of
regeneration
.
Here
,
with
keen
edges
*NL*
and
smooth
curves
,
were
forms
in
the
exact
likeness
of
those
he
had
*NL*
seen
abraded
and
time-eaten
on
the
walls
.
These
were
the
ideas
in
*NL*
modern
prose
which
the
lichened
colleges
presented
in
old
poetry
.
*NL*
Even
some
of
those
antiques
might
have
been
called
prose
when
they
*NL*
were
new
.
They
had
done
nothing
but
wait
,
and
had
become
poetical
.
*NL*
How
easy
to
the
smallest
building
;
how
impossible
to
most
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
asked
for
the
foreman
,
and
looked
round
among
the
new
traceries
,
*NL*
mullions
,
transoms
,
shafts
,
pinnacles
,
and
battlements
standing
on
*NL*
the
bankers
half
worked
,
or
waiting
to
be
removed
.
They
were
marked
*NL*
by
precision
,
mathematical
straightness
,
smoothness
,
exactitude
:
*NL*
there
in
the
old
walls
were
the
broken
lines
of
the
original
idea
;
*NL*
jagged
curves
,
disdain
of
precision
,
irregularity
,
disarray
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
moment
there
fell
on
Jude
a
true
illumination
;
that
here
in
the
*NL*
stone
yard
was
a
centre
of
effort
as
worthy
as
that
dignified
by
the
*NL*
name
of
scholarly
study
within
the
noblest
of
the
colleges
.
But
he
*NL*
lost
it
under
stress
of
his
old
idea
.
He
would
accept
any
employment
*NL*
which
might
be
offered
him
on
the
strength
of
his
late
employer
's
*NL*
recommendation
;
but
he
would
accept
it
as
a
provisional
thing
only
.
*NL*
This
was
his
form
of
the
modern
vice
of
unrest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
he
perceived
that
at
best
only
copying
,
patching
and
*NL*
imitating
went
on
here
;
which
he
fancied
to
be
owing
to
some
*NL*
temporary
and
local
cause
.
He
did
not
at
that
time
see
that
*NL*
mediaevalism
was
as
dead
as
a
fern-leaf
in
a
lump
of
coal
;
that
other
*NL*
developments
were
shaping
in
the
world
around
him
,
in
which
Gothic
*NL*
architecture
and
its
associations
had
no
place
.
The
deadly
animosity
*NL*
of
contemporary
logic
and
vision
towards
so
much
of
what
he
held
in
*NL*
reverence
was
not
yet
revealed
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
failed
to
obtain
work
here
as
yet
he
went
away
,
and
thought
*NL*
again
of
his
cousin
,
whose
presence
somewhere
at
hand
he
seemed
to
*NL*
feel
in
wavelets
of
interest
,
if
not
of
emotion
.
How
he
wished
he
*NL*
had
that
pretty
portrait
of
her
!
At
last
he
wrote
to
his
aunt
to
*NL*
send
it
.
She
did
so
,
with
a
request
,
however
,
that
he
was
not
to
*NL*
bring
disturbance
into
the
family
by
going
to
see
the
girl
or
her
*NL*
relations
.
Jude
,
a
ridiculously
affectionate
fellow
,
promised
*NL*
nothing
,
put
the
photograph
on
the
mantel-piece
,
kissed
it
--
he
did
*NL*
not
know
why
--
and
felt
more
at
home
.
She
seemed
to
look
down
and
*NL*
preside
over
his
tea
.
It
was
cheering
--
the
one
thing
uniting
him
to
*NL*
the
emotions
of
the
living
city
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
remained
the
schoolmaster
--
probably
now
a
reverend
parson
.
*NL*
But
he
could
not
possibly
hunt
up
such
a
respectable
man
just
yet
;
*NL*
so
raw
and
unpolished
was
his
condition
,
so
precarious
were
his
*NL*
fortunes
.
Thus
he
still
remained
in
loneliness
.
Although
people
*NL*
moved
round
him
he
virtually
saw
none
.
Not
as
yet
having
mingled
*NL*
with
the
active
life
of
the
place
it
was
largely
non-existent
to
him
.
*NL*
But
the
saints
and
prophets
in
the
window-tracery
,
the
paintings
*NL*
in
the
galleries
,
the
statues
,
the
busts
,
the
gargoyles
,
the
*NL*
corbel-heads
--
these
seemed
to
breathe
his
atmosphere
.
Like
all
*NL*
newcomers
to
a
spot
on
which
the
past
is
deeply
graven
he
heard
that
*NL*
past
announcing
itself
with
an
emphasis
altogether
unsuspected
by
,
*NL*
and
even
incredible
to
,
the
habitual
residents
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
many
days
he
haunted
the
cloisters
and
quadrangles
of
the
*NL*
colleges
at
odd
minutes
in
passing
them
,
surprised
by
impish
*NL*
echoes
of
his
own
footsteps
,
smart
as
the
blows
of
a
mallet
.
The
*NL*
Christminster
``
sentiment
,
''
as
it
had
been
called
,
ate
further
and
*NL*
further
into
him
;
till
he
probably
knew
more
about
those
buildings
*NL*
materially
,
artistically
,
and
historically
,
than
any
one
of
their
*NL*
inmates
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
till
now
,
when
he
found
himself
actually
on
the
spot
of
*NL*
his
enthusiasm
,
that
Jude
perceived
how
far
away
from
the
object
of
*NL*
that
enthusiasm
he
really
was
.
Only
a
wall
divided
him
from
those
*NL*
happy
young
contemporaries
of
his
with
whom
he
shared
a
common
mental
*NL*
life
;
men
who
had
nothing
to
do
from
morning
till
night
but
to
read
,
*NL*
mark
,
learn
,
and
inwardly
digest
.
Only
a
wall
--
but
what
a
wall
!
*NL*
*NL*
Every
day
,
every
hour
,
as
he
went
in
search
of
labour
,
he
saw
them
*NL*
going
and
coming
also
,
rubbed
shoulders
with
them
,
heard
their
*NL*
voices
,
marked
their
movements
.
The
conversation
of
some
of
the
*NL*
more
thoughtful
among
them
seemed
oftentimes
,
owing
to
his
long
and
*NL*
persistent
preparation
for
this
place
,
to
be
peculiarly
akin
to
his
*NL*
own
thoughts
.
Yet
he
was
as
far
from
them
as
if
he
had
been
at
the
*NL*
antipodes
.
Of
course
he
was
.
He
was
a
young
workman
in
a
white
*NL*
blouse
,
and
with
stone-dust
in
the
creases
of
his
clothes
;
and
in
*NL*
passing
him
they
did
not
even
see
him
,
or
hear
him
,
rather
saw
*NL*
through
him
as
through
a
pane
of
glass
at
their
familiars
beyond
.
*NL*
Whatever
they
were
to
him
,
he
to
them
was
not
on
the
spot
at
all
;
and
*NL*
yet
he
had
fancied
he
would
be
close
to
their
lives
by
coming
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
future
lay
ahead
after
all
;
and
if
he
could
only
be
so
*NL*
fortunate
as
to
get
into
good
employment
he
would
put
up
with
the
*NL*
inevitable
.
So
he
thanked
God
for
his
health
and
strength
,
and
took
*NL*
courage
.
For
the
present
he
was
outside
the
gates
of
everything
,
*NL*
colleges
included
:
perhaps
some
day
he
would
be
inside
.
Those
*NL*
palaces
of
light
and
leading
;
he
might
some
day
look
down
on
the
*NL*
world
through
their
panes
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
he
did
receive
a
message
from
the
stone-mason
's
yard
--
that
*NL*
a
job
was
waiting
for
him
.
It
was
his
first
encouragement
,
and
he
*NL*
closed
with
the
offer
promptly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
young
and
strong
,
or
he
never
could
have
executed
with
such
*NL*
zest
the
undertakings
to
which
he
now
applied
himself
,
since
they
*NL*
involved
reading
most
of
the
night
after
working
all
the
day
.
First
*NL*
he
bought
a
shaded
lamp
for
four
and
six-pence
,
and
obtained
a
good
*NL*
light
.
Then
he
got
pens
,
paper
,
and
such
other
necessary
books
as
he
*NL*
had
been
unable
to
obtain
elsewhere
.
Then
,
to
the
consternation
of
*NL*
his
landlady
,
he
shifted
all
the
furniture
of
his
room
--
a
single
one
*NL*
for
living
and
sleeping
--
rigged
up
a
curtain
on
a
rope
across
the
*NL*
middle
,
to
make
a
double
chamber
out
of
one
,
hung
up
a
thick
blind
*NL*
that
nobody
should
know
how
he
was
curtailing
the
hours
of
sleep
,
*NL*
laid
out
his
books
,
and
sat
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
been
deeply
encumbered
by
marrying
,
getting
a
cottage
,
and
*NL*
buying
the
furniture
which
had
disappeared
in
the
wake
of
his
wife
,
*NL*
he
had
never
been
able
to
save
any
money
since
the
time
of
those
*NL*
disastrous
ventures
,
and
till
his
wages
began
to
come
in
he
was
*NL*
obliged
to
live
in
the
narrowest
way
.
After
buying
a
book
or
two
*NL*
he
could
not
even
afford
himself
a
fire
;
and
when
the
nights
reeked
*NL*
with
the
raw
and
cold
air
from
the
Meadows
he
sat
over
his
lamp
in
*NL*
a
great-coat
,
hat
,
and
woollen
gloves
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
his
window
he
could
perceive
the
spire
of
the
cathedral
,
and
the
*NL*
ogee
dome
under
which
resounded
the
great
bell
of
the
city
.
The
tall
*NL*
tower
,
tall
belfry
windows
,
and
tall
pinnacles
of
the
college
by
the
*NL*
bridge
he
could
also
get
a
glimpse
of
by
going
to
the
staircase
.
*NL*
These
objects
he
used
as
stimulants
when
his
faith
in
the
future
was
*NL*
dim
.
*NL*
*NL*
Like
enthusiasts
in
general
he
made
no
inquiries
into
details
of
*NL*
procedure
.
Picking
up
general
notions
from
casual
acquaintance
,
he
*NL*
never
dwelt
upon
them
.
For
the
present
,
he
said
to
himself
,
the
one
*NL*
thing
necessary
was
to
get
ready
by
accumulating
money
and
knowledge
,
*NL*
and
await
whatever
chances
were
afforded
to
such
an
one
of
becoming
*NL*
a
son
of
the
University
.
``
For
wisdom
is
a
defence
,
and
money
is
a
*NL*
defence
;
but
the
excellency
of
knowledge
is
,
that
wisdom
giveth
life
*NL*
to
them
that
have
it
.
''
His
desire
absorbed
him
,
and
left
no
part
of
*NL*
him
to
weigh
its
practicability
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
time
he
received
a
nervously
anxious
letter
from
his
poor
old
*NL*
aunt
,
on
the
subject
which
had
previously
distressed
her
--
a
fear
that
*NL*
Jude
would
not
be
strong-minded
enough
to
keep
away
from
his
cousin
*NL*
Sue
Bridehead
and
her
relations
.
Sue
's
father
,
his
aunt
believed
,
*NL*
had
gone
back
to
London
,
but
the
girl
remained
at
Christminster
.
To
*NL*
make
her
still
more
objectionable
,
she
was
an
artist
or
designer
of
*NL*
some
sort
in
what
was
called
an
ecclesiastical
warehouse
,
which
was
*NL*
a
perfect
seed-bed
of
idolatry
,
and
she
was
no
doubt
abandoned
to
*NL*
mummeries
on
that
account
--
if
not
quite
a
Papist
.
-LRB-
Miss
Drusilla
*NL*
Fawley
was
of
her
date
,
Evangelical
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
As
Jude
was
rather
on
an
intellectual
track
than
a
theological
,
this
*NL*
news
of
Sue
's
probable
opinions
did
not
much
influence
him
one
way
or
*NL*
the
other
,
but
the
clue
to
her
whereabouts
was
decidedly
interesting
.
*NL*
With
an
altogether
singular
pleasure
he
walked
at
his
earliest
spare
*NL*
minutes
past
the
shops
answering
to
his
great-aunt
's
description
;
and
*NL*
beheld
in
one
of
them
a
young
girl
sitting
behind
a
desk
,
who
was
*NL*
suspiciously
like
the
original
of
the
portrait
.
He
ventured
to
enter
*NL*
on
a
trivial
errand
,
and
having
made
his
purchase
lingered
on
the
*NL*
scene
.
The
shop
seemed
to
be
kept
entirely
by
women
.
It
contained
*NL*
Anglican
books
,
stationery
,
texts
,
and
fancy
goods
:
little
plaster
*NL*
angels
on
brackets
,
Gothic-framed
pictures
of
saints
,
ebony
crosses
*NL*
that
were
almost
crucifixes
,
prayer-books
that
were
almost
missals
.
*NL*
He
felt
very
shy
of
looking
at
the
girl
in
the
desk
;
she
was
so
*NL*
pretty
that
he
could
not
believe
it
possible
that
she
should
belong
*NL*
to
him
.
Then
she
spoke
to
one
of
the
two
older
women
behind
the
*NL*
counter
;
and
he
recognized
in
the
accents
certain
qualities
of
his
*NL*
own
voice
;
softened
and
sweetened
,
but
his
own
.
What
was
she
doing
?
*NL*
He
stole
a
glance
round
.
Before
her
lay
a
piece
of
zinc
,
cut
to
*NL*
the
shape
of
a
scroll
three
or
four
feet
long
,
and
coated
with
a
*NL*
dead-surface
paint
on
one
side
.
Hereon
she
was
designing
or
*NL*
illuminating
,
in
characters
of
Church
text
,
the
single
word
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
L

U
J
A
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
sweet
,
saintly
,
Christian
business
,
hers
!
''
thought
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
presence
here
was
now
fairly
enough
explained
,
her
skill
in
*NL*
work
of
this
sort
having
no
doubt
been
acquired
from
her
father
's
*NL*
occupation
as
an
ecclesiastical
worker
in
metal
.
The
lettering
on
*NL*
which
she
was
engaged
was
clearly
intended
to
be
fixed
up
in
some
*NL*
chancel
to
assist
devotion
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
out
.
It
would
have
been
easy
to
speak
to
her
there
and
then
,
*NL*
but
it
seemed
scarcely
honourable
towards
his
aunt
to
disregard
her
*NL*
request
so
incontinently
.
She
had
used
him
roughly
,
but
she
had
*NL*
brought
him
up
:
and
the
fact
of
her
being
powerless
to
control
him
*NL*
lent
a
pathetic
force
to
a
wish
that
would
have
been
inoperative
as
*NL*
an
argument
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
Jude
gave
no
sign
.
He
would
not
call
upon
Sue
just
yet
.
He
had
*NL*
other
reasons
against
doing
so
when
he
had
walked
away
.
She
seemed
*NL*
so
dainty
beside
himself
in
his
rough
working-jacket
and
dusty
*NL*
trousers
that
he
felt
he
was
as
yet
unready
to
encounter
her
,
as
he
*NL*
had
felt
about
Mr.
Phillotson
.
And
how
possible
it
was
that
she
had
*NL*
inherited
the
antipathies
of
her
family
,
and
would
scorn
him
,
as
*NL*
far
as
a
Christian
could
,
particularly
when
he
had
told
her
that
*NL*
unpleasant
part
of
his
history
which
had
resulted
in
his
becoming
*NL*
enchained
to
one
of
her
own
sex
whom
she
would
certainly
not
admire
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
he
kept
watch
over
her
,
and
liked
to
feel
she
was
there
.
*NL*
The
consciousness
of
her
living
presence
stimulated
him
.
But
she
*NL*
remained
more
or
less
an
ideal
character
,
about
whose
form
he
began
*NL*
to
weave
curious
and
fantastic
day-dreams
.
*NL*
*NL*
Between
two
and
three
weeks
afterwards
Jude
was
engaged
with
some
*NL*
more
men
,
outside
Crozier
College
in
Old-time
Street
,
in
getting
a
*NL*
block
of
worked
freestone
from
a
waggon
across
the
pavement
,
before
*NL*
hoisting
it
to
the
parapet
which
they
were
repairing
.
Standing
in
*NL*
position
the
head
man
said
,
``
Spaik
when
he
heave
!
He-ho
!
''
And
they
*NL*
heaved
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
of
a
sudden
,
as
he
lifted
,
his
cousin
stood
close
to
his
elbow
,
*NL*
pausing
a
moment
on
the
bend
of
her
foot
till
the
obstructing
object
*NL*
should
have
been
removed
.
She
looked
right
into
his
face
with
*NL*
liquid
,
untranslatable
eyes
,
that
combined
,
or
seemed
to
him
to
*NL*
combine
,
keenness
with
tenderness
,
and
mystery
with
both
,
their
*NL*
expression
,
as
well
as
that
of
her
lips
,
taking
its
life
from
some
*NL*
words
just
spoken
to
a
companion
,
and
being
carried
on
into
his
face
*NL*
quite
unconsciously
.
She
no
more
observed
his
presence
than
that
of
*NL*
the
dust-motes
which
his
manipulations
raised
into
the
sunbeams
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
closeness
to
her
was
so
suggestive
that
he
trembled
,
and
turned
*NL*
his
face
away
with
a
shy
instinct
to
prevent
her
recognizing
him
,
*NL*
though
as
she
had
never
once
seen
him
she
could
not
possibly
do
so
;
*NL*
and
might
very
well
never
have
heard
even
his
name
.
He
could
*NL*
perceive
that
though
she
was
a
country-girl
at
bottom
,
a
latter
*NL*
girlhood
of
some
years
in
London
,
and
a
womanhood
here
,
had
taken
*NL*
all
rawness
out
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
was
gone
he
continued
his
work
,
reflecting
on
her
.
He
had
*NL*
been
so
caught
by
her
influence
that
he
had
taken
no
count
of
her
*NL*
general
mould
and
build
.
He
remembered
now
that
she
was
not
a
large
*NL*
figure
,
that
she
was
light
and
slight
,
of
the
type
dubbed
elegant
.
*NL*
That
was
about
all
he
had
seen
.
There
was
nothing
statuesque
in
her
;
*NL*
all
was
nervous
motion
.
She
was
mobile
,
living
,
yet
a
painter
might
*NL*
not
have
called
her
handsome
or
beautiful
.
But
the
much
that
she
was
*NL*
surprised
him
.
She
was
quite
a
long
way
removed
from
the
rusticity
*NL*
that
was
his
.
How
could
one
of
his
cross-grained
,
unfortunate
,
*NL*
almost
accursed
stock
,
have
contrived
to
reach
this
pitch
of
*NL*
niceness
?
London
had
done
it
,
he
supposed
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
this
moment
the
emotion
which
had
been
accumulating
in
his
*NL*
breast
as
the
bottled-up
effect
of
solitude
and
the
poetized
*NL*
locality
he
dwelt
in
,
insensibly
began
to
precipitate
itself
on
this
*NL*
half-visionary
form
;
and
he
perceived
that
,
whatever
his
obedient
*NL*
wish
in
a
contrary
direction
,
he
would
soon
be
unable
to
resist
the
*NL*
desire
to
make
himself
known
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
affected
to
think
of
her
quite
in
a
family
way
,
since
there
were
*NL*
crushing
reasons
why
he
should
not
and
could
not
think
of
her
in
any
*NL*
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
reason
was
that
he
was
married
,
and
it
would
be
wrong
.
*NL*
The
second
was
that
they
were
cousins
.
It
was
not
well
for
cousins
*NL*
to
fall
in
love
even
when
circumstances
seemed
to
favour
the
passion
.
*NL*
The
third
:
even
were
he
free
,
in
a
family
like
his
own
where
marriage
*NL*
usually
meant
a
tragic
sadness
,
marriage
with
a
blood-relation
would
*NL*
duplicate
the
adverse
conditions
,
and
a
tragic
sadness
might
be
*NL*
intensified
to
a
tragic
horror
.
*NL*
*NL*
Therefore
,
again
,
he
would
have
to
think
of
Sue
with
only
a
*NL*
relation
's
mutual
interest
in
one
belonging
to
him
;
regard
her
in
*NL*
a
practical
way
as
some
one
to
be
proud
of
;
to
talk
and
nod
to
;
*NL*
later
on
,
to
be
invited
to
tea
by
,
the
emotion
spent
on
her
being
*NL*
rigorously
that
of
a
kinsman
and
well-wisher
.
So
would
she
be
to
him
*NL*
a
kindly
star
,
an
elevating
power
,
a
companion
in
Anglican
worship
,
*NL*
a
tender
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
But
under
the
various
deterrent
influences
Jude
's
instinct
was
to
*NL*
approach
her
timidly
,
and
the
next
Sunday
he
went
to
the
morning
*NL*
service
in
the
Cathedral
church
of
Cardinal
College
to
gain
a
further
*NL*
view
of
her
,
for
he
had
found
that
she
frequently
attended
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
come
,
and
he
awaited
her
in
the
afternoon
,
which
was
*NL*
finer
.
He
knew
that
if
she
came
at
all
she
would
approach
the
*NL*
building
along
the
eastern
side
of
the
great
green
quadrangle
from
*NL*
which
it
was
accessible
,
and
he
stood
in
a
corner
while
the
bell
was
*NL*
going
.
A
few
minutes
before
the
hour
for
service
she
appeared
as
*NL*
one
of
the
figures
walking
along
under
the
college
walls
,
and
at
*NL*
sight
of
her
he
advanced
up
the
side
opposite
,
and
followed
her
into
*NL*
the
building
,
more
than
ever
glad
that
he
had
not
as
yet
revealed
*NL*
himself
.
To
see
her
,
and
to
be
himself
unseen
and
unknown
,
was
*NL*
enough
for
him
at
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
lingered
awhile
in
the
vestibule
,
and
the
service
was
some
way
*NL*
advanced
when
he
was
put
into
a
seat
.
It
was
a
louring
,
mournful
,
*NL*
still
afternoon
,
when
a
religion
of
some
sort
seems
a
necessity
to
*NL*
ordinary
practical
men
,
and
not
only
a
luxury
of
the
emotional
*NL*
and
leisured
classes
.
In
the
dim
light
and
the
baffling
glare
of
*NL*
the
clerestory
windows
he
could
discern
the
opposite
worshippers
*NL*
indistinctly
only
,
but
he
saw
that
Sue
was
among
them
.
He
had
not
*NL*
long
discovered
the
exact
seat
that
she
occupied
when
the
chanting
*NL*
of
the
119th
Psalm
in
which
the
choir
was
engaged
reached
its
second
*NL*
part
,
_
In
quo
corriget
_
,
the
organ
changing
to
a
pathetic
Gregorian
*NL*
tune
as
the
singers
gave
forth
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Wherewithal
shall
a
young
man
cleanse
his
way
?
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
very
question
that
was
engaging
Jude
's
attention
at
this
*NL*
moment
.
What
a
wicked
worthless
fellow
he
had
been
to
give
vent
as
*NL*
he
had
done
to
an
animal
passion
for
a
woman
,
and
allow
it
to
lead
*NL*
to
such
disastrous
consequences
;
then
to
think
of
putting
an
end
to
*NL*
himself
;
then
to
go
recklessly
and
get
drunk
.
The
great
waves
of
*NL*
pedal
music
tumbled
round
the
choir
,
and
,
nursed
on
the
supernatural
*NL*
as
he
had
been
,
it
is
not
wonderful
that
he
could
hardly
believe
that
*NL*
the
psalm
was
not
specially
set
by
some
regardful
Providence
for
this
*NL*
moment
of
his
first
entry
into
the
solemn
building
.
And
yet
it
was
*NL*
the
ordinary
psalm
for
the
twenty-fourth
evening
of
the
month
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
for
whom
he
was
beginning
to
nourish
an
extraordinary
*NL*
tenderness
was
at
this
time
ensphered
by
the
same
harmonies
as
those
*NL*
which
floated
into
his
ears
;
and
the
thought
was
a
delight
to
him
.
*NL*
She
was
probably
a
frequenter
of
this
place
,
and
,
steeped
body
and
*NL*
soul
in
church
sentiment
as
she
must
be
by
occupation
and
habit
,
had
,
*NL*
no
doubt
,
much
in
common
with
him
.
To
an
impressionable
and
lonely
*NL*
young
man
the
consciousness
of
having
at
last
found
anchorage
for
*NL*
his
thoughts
,
which
promised
to
supply
both
social
and
spiritual
*NL*
possibilities
,
was
like
the
dew
of
Hermon
,
and
he
remained
throughout
*NL*
the
service
in
a
sustaining
atmosphere
of
ecstasy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
he
was
loth
to
suspect
it
,
some
people
might
have
said
to
him
*NL*
that
the
atmosphere
blew
as
distinctly
from
Cyprus
as
from
Galilee
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
waited
till
she
had
left
her
seat
and
passed
under
the
screen
*NL*
before
he
himself
moved
.
She
did
not
look
towards
him
,
and
by
the
*NL*
time
he
reached
the
door
she
was
half-way
down
the
broad
path
.
*NL*
Being
dressed
up
in
his
Sunday
suit
he
was
inclined
to
follow
her
*NL*
and
reveal
himself
.
But
he
was
not
quite
ready
;
and
,
alas
,
ought
*NL*
he
to
do
so
with
the
kind
of
feeling
that
was
awakening
in
him
?
*NL*
*NL*
For
though
it
had
seemed
to
have
an
ecclesiastical
basis
during
the
*NL*
service
,
and
he
had
persuaded
himself
that
such
was
the
case
,
he
*NL*
could
not
altogether
be
blind
to
the
real
nature
of
the
magnetism
.
*NL*
She
was
such
a
stranger
that
the
kinship
was
affectation
,
and
he
*NL*
said
,
``
It
ca
n't
be
!
I
,
a
man
with
a
wife
,
must
not
know
her
!
''
Still
*NL*
Sue
WAS
his
own
kin
,
and
the
fact
of
his
having
a
wife
,
even
though
*NL*
she
was
not
in
evidence
in
this
hemisphere
,
might
be
a
help
in
one
*NL*
sense
.
It
would
put
all
thought
of
a
tender
wish
on
his
part
out
*NL*
of
Sue
's
mind
,
and
make
her
intercourse
with
him
free
and
fearless
.
*NL*
It
was
with
some
heartache
that
he
saw
how
little
he
cared
for
the
*NL*
freedom
and
fearlessness
that
would
result
in
her
from
such
*NL*
knowledge
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Some
little
time
before
the
date
of
this
service
in
the
cathedral
the
*NL*
pretty
,
liquid-eyed
,
light-footed
young
woman
,
Sue
Bridehead
,
had
an
*NL*
afternoon
's
holiday
,
and
leaving
the
ecclesiastical
establishment
in
*NL*
which
she
not
only
assisted
but
lodged
,
took
a
walk
into
the
country
*NL*
with
a
book
in
her
hand
.
It
was
one
of
those
cloudless
days
which
*NL*
sometimes
occur
in
Wessex
and
elsewhere
between
days
of
cold
and
wet
,
*NL*
as
if
intercalated
by
caprice
of
the
weather-god
.
She
went
along
for
*NL*
a
mile
or
two
until
she
came
to
much
higher
ground
than
that
of
the
*NL*
city
she
had
left
behind
her
.
The
road
passed
between
green
fields
,
*NL*
and
coming
to
a
stile
Sue
paused
there
,
to
finish
the
page
she
was
*NL*
reading
,
and
then
looked
back
at
the
towers
and
domes
and
pinnacles
*NL*
new
and
old
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
other
side
of
the
stile
,
in
the
footpath
,
she
beheld
a
*NL*
foreigner
with
black
hair
and
a
sallow
face
,
sitting
on
the
grass
*NL*
beside
a
large
square
board
whereon
were
fixed
,
as
closely
as
they
*NL*
could
stand
,
a
number
of
plaster
statuettes
,
some
of
them
bronzed
,
*NL*
which
he
was
re-arranging
before
proceeding
with
them
on
his
way
.
*NL*
They
were
in
the
main
reduced
copies
of
ancient
marbles
,
and
*NL*
comprised
divinities
of
a
very
different
character
from
those
the
*NL*
girl
was
accustomed
to
see
portrayed
,
among
them
being
a
Venus
of
*NL*
standard
pattern
,
a
Diana
,
and
,
of
the
other
sex
,
Apollo
,
Bacchus
,
*NL*
and
Mars
.
Though
the
figures
were
many
yards
away
from
her
the
*NL*
south-west
sun
brought
them
out
so
brilliantly
against
the
green
*NL*
herbage
that
she
could
discern
their
contours
with
luminous
*NL*
distinctness
;
and
being
almost
in
a
line
between
herself
and
the
*NL*
church
towers
of
the
city
they
awoke
in
her
an
oddly
foreign
and
*NL*
contrasting
set
of
ideas
by
comparison
.
The
man
rose
,
and
,
seeing
*NL*
her
,
politely
took
off
his
cap
,
and
cried
,
``
I-i-i-mages
!
''
in
an
accent
*NL*
that
agreed
with
his
appearance
.
In
a
moment
he
dexterously
lifted
*NL*
upon
his
knee
the
great
board
with
its
assembled
notabilities
divine
*NL*
and
human
,
and
raised
it
to
the
top
of
his
head
,
bringing
them
on
to
*NL*
her
and
resting
the
board
on
the
stile
.
First
he
offered
her
his
*NL*
smaller
wares
--
the
busts
of
kings
and
queens
,
then
a
minstrel
,
then
*NL*
a
winged
Cupid
.
She
shook
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
are
these
two
?
''
she
said
,
touching
with
her
finger
the
*NL*
Venus
and
the
Apollo
--
the
largest
figures
on
the
tray
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
she
should
have
them
for
ten
shillings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
afford
that
,
''
said
Sue
.
She
offered
considerably
less
,
*NL*
and
to
her
surprise
the
image-man
drew
them
from
their
wire
stay
and
*NL*
handed
them
over
the
stile
.
She
clasped
them
as
treasures
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
were
paid
for
,
and
the
man
had
gone
,
she
began
to
be
*NL*
concerned
as
to
what
she
should
do
with
them
.
They
seemed
so
very
*NL*
large
now
that
they
were
in
her
possession
,
and
so
very
naked
.
*NL*
Being
of
a
nervous
temperament
she
trembled
at
her
enterprise
.
*NL*
When
she
handled
them
the
white
pipeclay
came
off
on
her
gloves
and
*NL*
jacket
.
After
carrying
them
along
a
little
way
openly
an
idea
came
*NL*
to
her
,
and
,
pulling
some
huge
burdock
leaves
,
parsley
,
and
other
*NL*
rank
growths
from
the
hedge
,
she
wrapped
up
her
burden
as
well
as
she
*NL*
could
in
these
,
so
that
what
she
carried
appeared
to
be
an
enormous
*NL*
armful
of
green
stuff
gathered
by
a
zealous
lover
of
nature
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
anything
is
better
than
those
everlasting
church
fallals
!
''
she
*NL*
said
.
But
she
was
still
in
a
trembling
state
,
and
seemed
almost
to
*NL*
wish
she
had
not
bought
the
figures
.
*NL*
*NL*
Occasionally
peeping
inside
the
leaves
to
see
that
Venus
's
arm
was
*NL*
not
broken
,
she
entered
with
her
heathen
load
into
the
most
Christian
*NL*
city
in
the
country
by
an
obscure
street
running
parallel
to
the
main
*NL*
one
,
and
round
a
corner
to
the
side
door
of
the
establishment
to
*NL*
which
she
was
attached
.
Her
purchases
were
taken
straight
up
to
her
*NL*
own
chamber
,
and
she
at
once
attempted
to
lock
them
in
a
box
that
was
*NL*
her
very
own
property
;
but
finding
them
too
cumbersome
she
wrapped
*NL*
them
in
large
sheets
of
brown
paper
,
and
stood
them
on
the
floor
in
a
*NL*
corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mistress
of
the
house
,
Miss
Fontover
,
was
an
elderly
lady
in
*NL*
spectacles
,
dressed
almost
like
an
abbess
;
a
dab
at
Ritual
,
as
become
*NL*
one
of
her
business
,
and
a
worshipper
at
the
ceremonial
church
of
St.
*NL*
Silas
,
in
the
suburb
of
Beersheba
before-mentioned
,
which
Jude
also
*NL*
had
begun
to
attend
.
She
was
the
daughter
of
a
clergyman
in
reduced
*NL*
circumstances
,
and
at
his
death
,
which
had
occurred
several
years
*NL*
before
this
date
,
she
boldly
avoided
penury
by
taking
over
a
little
*NL*
shop
of
church
requisites
and
developing
it
to
its
present
creditable
*NL*
proportions
.
She
wore
a
cross
and
beads
round
her
neck
as
her
only
*NL*
ornament
,
and
knew
the
Christian
Year
by
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
now
came
to
call
Sue
to
tea
,
and
,
finding
that
the
girl
did
not
*NL*
respond
for
a
moment
,
entered
the
room
just
as
the
other
was
hastily
*NL*
putting
a
string
round
each
parcel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Something
you
have
been
buying
,
Miss
Bridehead
?
''
she
asked
,
*NL*
regarding
the
enwrapped
objects
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
just
something
to
ornament
my
room
,
''
said
Sue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
should
have
thought
I
had
put
enough
here
already
,
''
said
*NL*
Miss
Fontover
,
looking
round
at
the
Gothic-framed
prints
of
saints
,
*NL*
the
Church-text
scrolls
,
and
other
articles
which
,
having
become
too
*NL*
stale
to
sell
,
had
been
used
to
furnish
this
obscure
chamber
.
``
What
*NL*
is
it
?
How
bulky
!
''
She
tore
a
little
hole
,
about
as
big
as
a
wafer
,
*NL*
in
the
brown
paper
,
and
tried
to
peep
in
.
``
Why
,
statuary
?
Two
*NL*
figures
?
Where
did
you
get
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
I
bought
them
of
a
travelling
man
who
sells
casts
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Two
saints
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
ones
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
St.
Peter
and
St.
--
St.
Mary
Magdalen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
now
come
down
to
tea
,
and
go
and
finish
that
organ-text
,
if
*NL*
there
's
light
enough
afterwards
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
little
obstacles
to
the
indulgence
of
what
had
been
the
merest
*NL*
passing
fancy
created
in
Sue
a
great
zest
for
unpacking
her
objects
*NL*
and
looking
at
them
;
and
at
bedtime
,
when
she
was
sure
of
being
*NL*
undisturbed
,
she
unrobed
the
divinities
in
comfort
.
Placing
the
pair
*NL*
of
figures
on
the
chest
of
drawers
,
a
candle
on
each
side
of
them
,
*NL*
she
withdrew
to
the
bed
,
flung
herself
down
thereon
,
and
began
*NL*
reading
a
book
she
had
taken
from
her
box
,
which
Miss
Fontover
knew
*NL*
nothing
of
.
It
was
a
volume
of
Gibbon
,
and
she
read
the
chapter
*NL*
dealing
with
the
reign
of
Julian
the
Apostate
.
Occasionally
she
*NL*
looked
up
at
the
statuettes
,
which
appeared
strange
and
out
of
place
,
*NL*
there
happening
to
be
a
Calvary
print
hanging
between
them
,
and
,
*NL*
as
if
the
scene
suggested
the
action
,
she
at
length
jumped
up
and
*NL*
withdrew
another
book
from
her
box
--
a
volume
of
verse
--
and
turned
to
*NL*
the
familiar
poem
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Thou
hast
conquered
,
O
pale
Galilean
:
*NL*
The
world
has
grown
grey
from
thy
breath
!
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
which
she
read
to
the
end
.
Presently
she
put
out
the
candles
,
*NL*
undressed
,
and
finally
extinguished
her
own
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
of
an
age
which
usually
sleeps
soundly
,
yet
to-night
she
*NL*
kept
waking
up
,
and
every
time
she
opened
her
eyes
there
was
enough
*NL*
diffused
light
from
the
street
to
show
her
the
white
plaster
figures
,
*NL*
standing
on
the
chest
of
drawers
in
odd
contrast
to
their
environment
*NL*
of
text
and
martyr
,
and
the
Gothic-framed
Crucifix-picture
that
was
*NL*
only
discernible
now
as
a
Latin
cross
,
the
figure
thereon
being
*NL*
obscured
by
the
shades
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
one
of
these
occasions
the
church
clocks
struck
some
small
hour
.
*NL*
It
fell
upon
the
ears
of
another
person
who
sat
bending
over
his
*NL*
books
at
a
not
very
distant
spot
in
the
same
city
.
Being
Saturday
*NL*
night
the
morrow
was
one
on
which
Jude
had
not
set
his
alarm-clock
to
*NL*
call
him
at
his
usually
early
time
,
and
hence
he
had
stayed
up
,
as
*NL*
was
his
custom
,
two
or
three
hours
later
than
he
could
afford
to
do
*NL*
on
any
other
day
of
the
week
.
Just
then
he
was
earnestly
reading
*NL*
from
his
Griesbach
's
text
.
At
the
very
time
that
Sue
was
tossing
and
*NL*
staring
at
her
figures
,
the
policeman
and
belated
citizens
passing
*NL*
along
under
his
window
might
have
heard
,
if
they
had
stood
still
,
*NL*
strange
syllables
mumbled
with
fervour
within
--
words
that
had
for
*NL*
Jude
an
indescribable
enchantment
:
inexplicable
sounds
something
*NL*
like
these
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
All
hemin
heis
Theos
ho
Pater
,
ex
hou
ta
panta
,
kai
hemeis
eis
*NL*
auton
:
_
''
*NL*
*NL*
Till
the
sounds
rolled
with
reverent
loudness
,
as
a
book
was
heard
*NL*
to
close
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Kai
heis
Kurios
Iesous
Christos
,
di
hou
ta
panta
kai
hemeis
di
*NL*

_
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
handy
man
at
his
trade
,
an
all-round
man
,
as
artizans
in
*NL*
country-towns
are
apt
to
be
.
In
London
the
man
who
carves
the
boss
*NL*
or
knob
of
leafage
declines
to
cut
the
fragment
of
moulding
which
*NL*
merges
in
that
leafage
,
as
if
it
were
a
degradation
to
do
the
second
*NL*
half
of
one
whole
.
When
there
was
not
much
Gothic
moulding
for
*NL*
Jude
to
run
,
or
much
window-tracery
on
the
bankers
,
he
would
go
out
*NL*
lettering
monuments
or
tombstones
,
and
take
a
pleasure
in
the
change
*NL*
of
handiwork
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
time
that
he
saw
her
was
when
he
was
on
a
ladder
executing
*NL*
a
job
of
this
sort
inside
one
of
the
churches
.
There
was
a
short
*NL*
morning
service
,
and
when
the
parson
entered
Jude
came
down
from
his
*NL*
ladder
,
and
sat
with
the
half-dozen
people
forming
the
congregation
,
*NL*
till
the
prayer
should
be
ended
,
and
he
could
resume
his
tapping
.
He
*NL*
did
not
observe
till
the
service
was
half
over
that
one
of
the
women
*NL*
was
Sue
,
who
had
perforce
accompanied
the
elderly
Miss
Fontover
*NL*
thither
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
sat
watching
her
pretty
shoulders
,
her
easy
,
curiously
*NL*
nonchalant
risings
and
sittings
,
and
her
perfunctory
genuflexions
,
*NL*
and
thought
what
a
help
such
an
Anglican
would
have
been
to
him
in
*NL*
happier
circumstances
.
It
was
not
so
much
his
anxiety
to
get
on
with
*NL*
his
work
that
made
him
go
up
to
it
immediately
the
worshipers
began
*NL*
to
take
their
leave
:
it
was
that
he
dared
not
,
in
this
holy
spot
,
*NL*
confront
the
woman
who
was
beginning
to
influence
him
in
such
an
*NL*
indescribable
manner
.
Those
three
enormous
reasons
why
he
must
*NL*
not
attempt
intimate
acquaintance
with
Sue
Bridehead
,
now
that
his
*NL*
interest
in
her
had
shown
itself
to
be
unmistakably
of
a
sexual
kind
,
*NL*
loomed
as
stubbornly
as
ever
.
But
it
was
also
obvious
that
man
could
*NL*
not
live
by
work
alone
;
that
the
particular
man
Jude
,
at
any
rate
,
*NL*
wanted
something
to
love
.
Some
men
would
have
rushed
incontinently
*NL*
to
her
,
snatched
the
pleasure
of
easy
friendship
which
she
could
*NL*
hardly
refuse
,
and
have
left
the
rest
to
chance
.
Not
so
Jude
--
at
*NL*
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
as
the
days
,
and
still
more
particularly
the
lonely
evenings
,
*NL*
dragged
along
,
he
found
himself
,
to
his
moral
consternation
,
*NL*
to
be
thinking
more
of
her
instead
of
thinking
less
of
her
,
and
*NL*
experiencing
a
fearful
bliss
in
doing
what
was
erratic
,
informal
,
and
*NL*
unexpected
.
Surrounded
by
her
influence
all
day
,
walking
past
the
*NL*
spots
she
frequented
,
he
was
always
thinking
of
her
,
and
was
obliged
*NL*
to
own
to
himself
that
his
conscience
was
likely
to
be
the
loser
in
*NL*
this
battle
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
be
sure
she
was
almost
an
ideality
to
him
still
.
Perhaps
to
know
*NL*
her
would
be
to
cure
himself
of
this
unexpected
and
unauthorized
*NL*
passion
.
A
voice
whispered
that
,
though
he
desired
to
know
her
,
he
*NL*
did
not
desire
to
be
cured
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
not
the
least
doubt
that
from
his
own
orthodox
point
of
*NL*
view
the
situation
was
growing
immoral
.
For
Sue
to
be
the
loved
one
*NL*
of
a
man
who
was
licensed
by
the
laws
of
his
country
to
love
Arabella
*NL*
and
none
other
unto
his
life
's
end
,
was
a
pretty
bad
second
beginning
*NL*
when
the
man
was
bent
on
such
a
course
as
Jude
purposed
.
This
*NL*
conviction
was
so
real
with
him
that
one
day
when
,
as
was
frequent
,
*NL*
he
was
at
work
in
a
neighbouring
village
church
alone
,
he
felt
it
to
*NL*
be
his
duty
to
pray
against
his
weakness
.
But
much
as
he
wished
to
*NL*
be
an
exemplar
in
these
things
he
could
not
get
on
.
It
was
quite
*NL*
impossible
,
he
found
,
to
ask
to
be
delivered
from
temptation
when
*NL*
your
heart
's
desire
was
to
be
tempted
unto
seventy
times
seven
.
So
*NL*
he
excused
himself
.
``
After
all
,
''
he
said
,
``
it
is
not
altogether
*NL*
an
_
erotolepsy
_
that
is
the
matter
with
me
,
as
at
that
first
time
.
*NL*
I
can
see
that
she
is
exceptionally
bright
;
and
it
is
partly
a
wish
*NL*
for
intellectual
sympathy
,
and
a
craving
for
loving-kindness
in
my
*NL*
solitude
.
''
Thus
he
went
on
adoring
her
,
fearing
to
realize
that
*NL*
it
was
human
perversity
.
For
whatever
Sue
's
virtues
,
talents
,
or
*NL*
ecclesiastical
saturation
,
it
was
certain
that
those
items
were
not
*NL*
at
all
the
cause
of
his
affection
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
an
afternoon
at
this
time
a
young
girl
entered
the
stone-mason
's
*NL*
yard
with
some
hesitation
,
and
,
lifting
her
skirts
to
avoid
draggling
*NL*
them
in
the
white
dust
,
crossed
towards
the
office
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
nice
girl
,
''
said
one
of
the
men
known
as
Uncle
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
she
?
''
asked
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
--
I
've
seen
her
about
here
and
there
.
Why
,
yes
,
she
's
*NL*
the
daughter
of
that
clever
chap
Bridehead
who
did
all
the
wrought
*NL*
ironwork
at
St.
Silas
'
ten
years
ago
,
and
went
away
to
London
*NL*
afterwards
.
I
do
n't
know
what
he
's
doing
now
--
not
much
I
fancy
--
as
*NL*
she
's
come
back
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
the
young
woman
had
knocked
at
the
office
door
and
asked
if
*NL*
Mr.
Jude
Fawley
was
at
work
in
the
yard
.
It
so
happened
that
Jude
*NL*
had
gone
out
somewhere
or
other
that
afternoon
,
which
information
she
*NL*
received
with
a
look
of
disappointment
,
and
went
away
immediately
.
*NL*
When
Jude
returned
they
told
him
,
and
described
her
,
whereupon
he
*NL*
exclaimed
,
``
Why
--
that
's
my
cousin
Sue
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
along
the
street
after
her
,
but
she
was
out
of
sight
.
He
*NL*
had
no
longer
any
thought
of
a
conscientious
avoidance
of
her
,
and
*NL*
resolved
to
call
upon
her
that
very
evening
.
And
when
he
reached
*NL*
his
lodging
he
found
a
note
from
her
--
a
first
note
--
one
of
those
*NL*
documents
which
,
simple
and
commonplace
in
themselves
,
are
seen
*NL*
retrospectively
to
have
been
pregnant
with
impassioned
consequences
.
*NL*
The
very
unconsciousness
of
a
looming
drama
which
is
shown
in
such
*NL*
innocent
first
epistles
from
women
to
men
,
or
_
vice
versa
_
,
makes
*NL*
them
,
when
such
a
drama
follows
,
and
they
are
read
over
by
the
purple
*NL*
or
lurid
light
of
it
,
all
the
more
impressive
,
solemn
,
and
in
cases
,
*NL*
terrible
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sue
's
was
of
the
most
artless
and
natural
kind
.
She
addressed
him
*NL*
as
her
dear
cousin
Jude
;
said
she
had
only
just
learnt
by
the
merest
*NL*
accident
that
he
was
living
in
Christminster
,
and
reproached
him
with
*NL*
not
letting
her
know
.
They
might
have
had
such
nice
times
together
,
*NL*
she
said
,
for
she
was
thrown
much
upon
herself
,
and
had
hardly
any
*NL*
congenial
friend
.
But
now
there
was
every
probability
of
her
soon
*NL*
going
away
,
so
that
the
chance
of
companionship
would
be
lost
perhaps
*NL*
for
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
cold
sweat
overspread
Jude
at
the
news
that
she
was
going
away
.
*NL*
That
was
a
contingency
he
had
never
thought
of
,
and
it
spurred
him
*NL*
to
write
all
the
more
quickly
to
her
.
He
would
meet
her
that
very
*NL*
evening
,
he
said
,
one
hour
from
the
time
of
writing
,
at
the
cross
in
*NL*
the
pavement
which
marked
the
spot
of
the
Martyrdoms
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
despatched
the
note
by
a
boy
he
regretted
that
in
his
*NL*
hurry
he
should
have
suggested
to
her
to
meet
him
out
of
doors
,
when
*NL*
he
might
have
said
he
would
call
upon
her
.
It
was
,
in
fact
,
the
*NL*
country
custom
to
meet
thus
,
and
nothing
else
had
occurred
to
him
.
*NL*
Arabella
had
been
met
in
the
same
way
,
unfortunately
,
and
it
might
*NL*
not
seem
respectable
to
a
dear
girl
like
Sue
.
However
,
it
could
not
*NL*
be
helped
now
,
and
he
moved
towards
the
point
a
few
minutes
before
*NL*
the
hour
,
under
the
glimmer
of
the
newly
lighted
lamps
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
broad
street
was
silent
,
and
almost
deserted
,
although
it
was
*NL*
not
late
.
He
saw
a
figure
on
the
other
side
,
which
turned
out
to
*NL*
be
hers
,
and
they
both
converged
towards
the
crossmark
at
the
same
*NL*
moment
.
Before
either
had
reached
it
she
called
out
to
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
going
to
meet
you
just
there
,
for
the
first
time
in
my
*NL*
life
!
Come
further
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
voice
,
though
positive
and
silvery
,
had
been
tremulous
.
They
*NL*
walked
on
in
parallel
lines
,
and
,
waiting
her
pleasure
,
Jude
watched
*NL*
till
she
showed
signs
of
closing
in
,
when
he
did
likewise
,
the
place
*NL*
being
where
the
carriers
'
carts
stood
in
the
daytime
,
though
there
*NL*
was
none
on
the
spot
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
that
I
asked
you
to
meet
me
,
and
did
n't
call
,
''
began
Jude
*NL*
with
the
bashfulness
of
a
lover
.
``
But
I
thought
it
would
save
time
*NL*
if
we
were
going
to
walk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
I
do
n't
mind
that
,
''
she
said
with
the
freedom
of
a
friend
.
``
I
*NL*
have
really
no
place
to
ask
anybody
in
to
.
What
I
meant
was
that
the
*NL*
place
you
chose
was
so
horrid
--
I
suppose
I
ought
not
to
say
horrid
--
I
*NL*
mean
gloomy
and
inauspicious
in
its
associations
...
But
is
n't
it
*NL*
funny
to
begin
like
this
,
when
I
do
n't
know
you
yet
?
''
She
looked
him
*NL*
up
and
down
curiously
,
though
Jude
did
not
look
much
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
seem
to
know
me
more
than
I
know
you
,
''
she
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
I
have
seen
you
now
and
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
knew
who
I
was
,
and
did
n't
speak
?
And
now
I
am
going
away
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
That
's
unfortunate
.
I
have
hardly
any
other
friend
.
I
have
,
*NL*
indeed
,
one
very
old
friend
here
somewhere
,
but
I
do
n't
quite
like
*NL*
to
call
on
him
just
yet
.
I
wonder
if
you
know
anything
of
him
--
Mr.
*NL*
Phillotson
?
A
parson
somewhere
about
the
county
I
think
he
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
I
only
know
of
one
Mr.
Phillotson
.
He
lives
a
little
way
out
in
*NL*
the
country
,
at
Lumsdon
.
He
's
a
village
schoolmaster
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
I
wonder
if
he
's
the
same
.
Surely
it
is
impossible
!
Only
a
*NL*
schoolmaster
still
!
Do
you
know
his
Christian
name
--
is
it
Richard
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
it
is
;
I
've
directed
books
to
him
,
though
I
've
never
seen
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
he
could
n't
do
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
's
countenance
fell
,
for
how
could
he
succeed
in
an
enterprise
*NL*
wherein
the
great
Phillotson
had
failed
?
He
would
have
had
a
day
of
*NL*
despair
if
the
news
had
not
arrived
during
his
sweet
Sue
's
presence
,
*NL*
but
even
at
this
moment
he
had
visions
of
how
Phillotson
's
failure
in
*NL*
the
grand
university
scheme
would
depress
him
when
she
had
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
we
are
going
to
take
a
walk
,
suppose
we
go
and
call
upon
him
?
''
*NL*
said
Jude
suddenly
.
``
It
is
not
late
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
agreed
,
and
they
went
along
up
a
hill
,
and
through
some
prettily
*NL*
wooded
country
.
Presently
the
embattled
tower
and
square
turret
*NL*
of
the
church
rose
into
the
sky
,
and
then
the
school-house
.
They
*NL*
inquired
of
a
person
in
the
street
if
Mr.
Phillotson
was
likely
to
*NL*
be
at
home
,
and
were
informed
that
he
was
always
at
home
.
A
knock
*NL*
brought
him
to
the
school-house
door
,
with
a
candle
in
his
hand
and
a
*NL*
look
of
inquiry
on
his
face
,
which
had
grown
thin
and
careworn
since
*NL*
Jude
last
set
eyes
on
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
after
all
these
years
the
meeting
with
Mr.
Phillotson
should
be
*NL*
of
this
homely
complexion
destroyed
at
one
stroke
the
halo
which
had
*NL*
surrounded
the
school-master
's
figure
in
Jude
's
imagination
ever
*NL*
since
their
parting
.
It
created
in
him
at
the
same
time
a
sympathy
*NL*
with
Phillotson
as
an
obviously
much
chastened
and
disappointed
man
.
*NL*
Jude
told
him
his
name
,
and
said
he
had
come
to
see
him
as
an
old
*NL*
friend
who
had
been
kind
to
him
in
his
youthful
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
remember
you
in
the
least
,
''
said
the
school-master
*NL*
thoughtfully
.
``
You
were
one
of
my
pupils
,
you
say
?
Yes
,
no
doubt
;
*NL*
but
they
number
so
many
thousands
by
this
time
of
my
life
,
and
have
*NL*
naturally
changed
so
much
,
that
I
remember
very
few
except
the
quite
*NL*
recent
ones
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
out
at
Marygreen
,
''
said
Jude
,
wishing
he
had
not
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
I
was
there
a
short
time
.
And
is
this
an
old
pupil
,
too
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
that
's
my
cousin
...
I
wrote
to
you
for
some
grammars
,
if
you
*NL*
recollect
,
and
you
sent
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
--
yes
!
--
I
do
dimly
recall
that
incident
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
very
kind
of
you
to
do
it
.
And
it
was
you
who
first
started
*NL*
me
on
that
course
.
On
the
morning
you
left
Marygreen
,
when
your
*NL*
goods
were
on
the
waggon
,
you
wished
me
good-bye
,
and
said
your
*NL*
scheme
was
to
be
a
university
man
and
enter
the
Church
--
that
a
degree
*NL*
was
the
necessary
hall-mark
of
one
who
wanted
to
do
anything
as
a
*NL*
theologian
or
teacher
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
remember
I
thought
all
that
privately
;
but
I
wonder
I
did
not
keep
*NL*
my
own
counsel
.
The
idea
was
given
up
years
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
never
forgotten
it
.
It
was
that
which
brought
me
to
this
*NL*
part
of
the
country
,
and
out
here
to
see
you
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
in
,
''
said
Phillotson
.
``
And
your
cousin
,
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
entered
the
parlour
of
the
school-house
,
where
there
was
a
lamp
*NL*
with
a
paper
shade
,
which
threw
the
light
down
on
three
or
four
*NL*
books
.
Phillotson
took
it
off
,
so
that
they
could
see
each
other
*NL*
better
,
and
the
rays
fell
on
the
nervous
little
face
and
vivacious
*NL*
dark
eyes
and
hair
of
Sue
,
on
the
earnest
features
of
her
cousin
,
*NL*
and
on
the
schoolmaster
's
own
maturer
face
and
figure
,
showing
him
*NL*
to
be
a
spare
and
thoughtful
personage
of
five-and-forty
,
with
a
*NL*
thin-lipped
,
somewhat
refined
mouth
,
a
slightly
stooping
habit
,
and
*NL*
a
black
frock
coat
,
which
from
continued
frictions
shone
a
little
at
*NL*
the
shoulder-blades
,
the
middle
of
the
back
,
and
the
elbows
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
friendship
was
imperceptibly
renewed
,
the
schoolmaster
*NL*
speaking
of
his
experiences
,
and
the
cousins
of
theirs
.
He
told
them
*NL*
that
he
still
thought
of
the
Church
sometimes
,
and
that
though
he
*NL*
could
not
enter
it
as
he
had
intended
to
do
in
former
years
he
might
*NL*
enter
it
as
a
licentiate
.
Meanwhile
,
he
said
,
he
was
comfortable
in
*NL*
his
present
position
,
though
he
was
in
want
of
a
pupil-teacher
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
did
not
stay
to
supper
,
Sue
having
to
be
indoors
before
it
grew
*NL*
late
,
and
the
road
was
retraced
to
Christminster
.
Though
they
had
*NL*
talked
of
nothing
more
than
general
subjects
,
Jude
was
surprised
to
*NL*
find
what
a
revelation
of
woman
his
cousin
was
to
him
.
She
was
so
*NL*
vibrant
that
everything
she
did
seemed
to
have
its
source
in
feeling
.
*NL*
An
exciting
thought
would
make
her
walk
ahead
so
fast
that
he
could
*NL*
hardly
keep
up
with
her
;
and
her
sensitiveness
on
some
points
*NL*
was
such
that
it
might
have
been
misread
as
vanity
.
It
was
with
*NL*
heart-sickness
he
perceived
that
,
while
her
sentiments
towards
him
*NL*
were
those
of
the
frankest
friendliness
only
,
he
loved
her
more
than
*NL*
before
becoming
acquainted
with
her
;
and
the
gloom
of
the
walk
home
*NL*
lay
not
in
the
night
overhead
,
but
in
the
thought
of
her
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
must
you
leave
Christminster
?
''
he
said
regretfully
.
``
How
can
*NL*
you
do
otherwise
than
cling
to
a
city
in
whose
history
such
men
as
*NL*
Newman
,
Pusey
,
Ward
,
Keble
,
loom
so
large
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
they
do
.
Though
how
large
do
they
loom
in
the
history
of
the
*NL*
world
?
...
What
a
funny
reason
for
caring
to
stay
!
I
should
never
*NL*
have
thought
of
it
!
''
She
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
I
must
go
,
''
she
continued
.
``
Miss
Fontover
,
one
of
the
*NL*
partners
whom
I
serve
,
is
offended
with
me
,
and
I
with
her
;
and
it
*NL*
is
best
to
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
did
that
happen
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
broke
some
statuary
of
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
?
Wilfully
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
She
found
it
in
my
room
,
and
though
it
was
my
property
she
*NL*
threw
it
on
the
floor
and
stamped
on
it
,
because
it
was
not
according
*NL*
to
her
taste
,
and
ground
the
arms
and
the
head
of
one
of
the
figures
*NL*
all
to
bits
with
her
heel
--
a
horrid
thing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Too
Catholic-Apostolic
for
her
,
I
suppose
?
No
doubt
she
called
them
*NL*
popish
images
and
talked
of
the
invocation
of
saints
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
...
No
,
she
did
n't
do
that
.
She
saw
the
matter
quite
*NL*
differently
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
Then
I
am
surprised
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
It
was
for
quite
some
other
reason
that
she
did
n't
like
my
*NL*
patron-saints
.
So
I
was
led
to
retort
upon
her
;
and
the
end
of
it
*NL*
was
that
I
resolved
not
to
stay
,
but
to
get
into
an
occupation
in
*NL*
which
I
shall
be
more
independent
.

you

again

I
never

go

Good-bye

I
am
so
*NL*
glad
we
have
met
at
last

We
need

quarrel
because

did

*NL*
*NL*
Jude
did
not
like
to
let
her
see
quite
how
much
he
agreed
with
her
,
*NL*
and
went
his
way
to
the
remote
street
in
which
he
had
his
lodging
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
keep
Sue
Bridehead
near
him
was
now
a
desire
which
operated
*NL*
without
regard
of
consequences
,
and
the
next
evening
he
again
set
out
*NL*
for
Lumsdon
,
fearing
to
trust
to
the
persuasive
effects
of
a
note
*NL*
only
.
The
school-master
was
unprepared
for
such
a
proposal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
I
rather
wanted
was
a
second
year
's
transfer
,
as
it
is
called
,
''
*NL*
he
said
.
``
Of
course
your
cousin
would
do
,
personally
;
but
she
has
*NL*
had
no
experience
.
Oh
--
she
has
,
has
she
?
Does
she
really
think
of
*NL*
adopting
teaching
as
a
profession
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
said
she
was
disposed
to
do
so
,
he
thought
,
and
his
ingenious
*NL*
arguments
on
her
natural
fitness
for
assisting
Mr.
Phillotson
,
of
*NL*
which
Jude
knew
nothing
whatever
,
so
influenced
the
schoolmaster
that
*NL*
he
said
he
would
engage
her
,
assuring
Jude
as
a
friend
that
unless
*NL*
his
cousin
really
meant
to
follow
on
in
the
same
course
,
and
regarded
*NL*
this
step
as
the
first
stage
of
an
apprenticeship
,
of
which
her
*NL*
training
in
a
normal
school
would
be
the
second
stage
,
her
time
would
*NL*
be
wasted
quite
,
the
salary
being
merely
nominal
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
after
this
visit
Phillotson
received
a
letter
from
Jude
,
*NL*
containing
the
information
that
he
had
again
consulted
his
cousin
,
*NL*
who
took
more
and
more
warmly
to
the
idea
of
tuition
;
and
that
*NL*
she
had
agreed
to
come
.
It
did
not
occur
for
a
moment
to
the
*NL*
schoolmaster
and
recluse
that
Jude
's
ardour
in
promoting
the
*NL*
arrangement
arose
from
any
other
feelings
towards
Sue
than
the
*NL*
instinct
of
co-operation
common
among
members
of
the
same
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
V
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
schoolmaster
sat
in
his
homely
dwelling
attached
to
the
school
,
*NL*
both
being
modern
erections
;
and
he
looked
across
the
way
at
the
old
*NL*
house
in
which
his
teacher
Sue
had
a
lodging
.
The
arrangement
had
*NL*
been
concluded
very
quickly
.
A
pupil-teacher
who
was
to
have
been
*NL*
transferred
to
Mr.
Phillotson
's
school
had
failed
him
,
and
Sue
had
*NL*
been
taken
as
stop-gap
.
All
such
provisional
arrangements
as
these
*NL*
could
only
last
till
the
next
annual
visit
of
H.M.
Inspector
,
whose
*NL*
approval
was
necessary
to
make
them
permanent
.
Having
taught
for
*NL*
some
two
years
in
London
,
though
she
had
abandoned
that
vocation
of
*NL*
late
,
Miss
Bridehead
was
not
exactly
a
novice
,
and
Phillotson
thought
*NL*
there
would
be
no
difficulty
in
retaining
her
services
,
which
he
*NL*
already
wished
to
do
,
though
she
had
only
been
with
him
three
or
four
*NL*
weeks
.
He
had
found
her
quite
as
bright
as
Jude
had
described
her
;
*NL*
and
what
master-tradesman
does
not
wish
to
keep
an
apprentice
who
*NL*
saves
him
half
his
labour
?
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
little
over
half-past
eight
o'clock
in
the
morning
and
he
*NL*
was
waiting
to
see
her
cross
the
road
to
the
school
,
when
he
would
*NL*
follow
.
At
twenty
minutes
to
nine
she
did
cross
,
a
light
hat
tossed
*NL*
on
her
head
;
and
he
watched
her
as
a
curiosity
.
A
new
emanation
,
*NL*
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
her
skill
as
a
teacher
,
seemed
to
*NL*
surround
her
this
morning
.
He
went
to
the
school
also
,
and
Sue
*NL*
remained
governing
her
class
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
all
day
*NL*
under
his
eye
.
She
certainly
was
an
excellent
teacher
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
part
of
his
duty
to
give
her
private
lessons
in
the
evening
,
*NL*
and
some
article
in
the
Code
made
it
necessary
that
a
respectable
,
*NL*
elderly
woman
should
be
present
at
these
lessons
when
the
teacher
and
*NL*
the
taught
were
of
different
sexes
.
Richard
Phillotson
thought
of
*NL*
the
absurdity
of
the
regulation
in
this
case
,
when
he
was
old
enough
*NL*
to
be
the
girl
's
father
;
but
he
faithfully
acted
up
to
it
;
and
sat
*NL*
down
with
her
in
a
room
where
Mrs.
Hawes
,
the
widow
at
whose
house
*NL*
Sue
lodged
,
occupied
herself
with
sewing
.
The
regulation
was
,
*NL*
indeed
,
not
easy
to
evade
,
for
there
was
no
other
sitting-room
in
the
*NL*
dwelling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
as
she
figured
--
it
was
arithmetic
that
they
were
working
*NL*
at
--
she
would
involuntarily
glance
up
with
a
little
inquiring
smile
*NL*
at
him
,
as
if
she
assumed
that
,
being
the
master
,
he
must
perceive
*NL*
all
that
was
passing
in
her
brain
,
as
right
or
wrong
.
Phillotson
was
*NL*
not
really
thinking
of
the
arithmetic
at
all
,
but
of
her
,
in
a
novel
*NL*
way
which
somehow
seemed
strange
to
him
as
preceptor
.
Perhaps
she
*NL*
knew
that
he
was
thinking
of
her
thus
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
few
weeks
their
work
had
gone
on
with
a
monotony
which
in
*NL*
itself
was
a
delight
to
him
.
Then
it
happened
that
the
children
were
*NL*
to
be
taken
to
Christminster
to
see
an
itinerant
exhibition
,
in
the
*NL*
shape
of
a
model
of
Jerusalem
,
to
which
schools
were
admitted
at
*NL*
a
penny
a
head
in
the
interests
of
education
.
They
marched
along
*NL*
the
road
two
and
two
,
she
beside
her
class
with
her
simple
cotton
*NL*
sunshade
,
her
little
thumb
cocked
up
against
its
stem
;
and
Phillotson
*NL*
behind
in
his
long
dangling
coat
,
handling
his
walking-stick
*NL*
genteelly
,
in
the
musing
mood
which
had
come
over
him
since
her
*NL*
arrival
.
The
afternoon
was
one
of
sun
and
dust
,
and
when
they
*NL*
entered
the
exhibition
room
few
people
were
present
but
themselves
.
*NL*
The
model
of
the
ancient
city
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
apartment
,
*NL*
and
the
proprietor
,
with
a
fine
religious
philanthropy
written
on
his
*NL*
features
,
walked
round
it
with
a
pointer
in
his
hand
,
showing
the
*NL*
young
people
the
various
quarters
and
places
known
to
them
by
name
*NL*
from
reading
their
Bibles
;
Mount
Moriah
,
the
Valley
of
Jehoshaphat
,
*NL*
the
City
of
Zion
,
the
walls
and
the
gates
,
outside
one
of
which
there
*NL*
was
a
large
mound
like
a
tumulus
,
and
on
the
mound
a
little
white
*NL*
cross
.
The
spot
,
he
said
,
was
Calvary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
,
''
said
Sue
to
the
schoolmaster
,
as
she
stood
with
him
a
*NL*
little
in
the
background
,
``
that
this
model
,
elaborate
as
it
is
,
is
a
*NL*
very
imaginary
production
.
How
does
anybody
know
that
Jerusalem
was
*NL*
like
this
in
the
time
of
Christ
?
I
am
sure
this
man
does
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
made
after
the
best
conjectural
maps
,
based
on
actual
visits
*NL*
to
the
city
as
it
now
exists
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
fancy
we
have
had
enough
of
Jerusalem
,
''
she
said
,
``
considering
we
*NL*
are
not
descended
from
the
Jews
.
There
was
nothing
first-rate
about
*NL*
the
place
,
or
people
,
after
all
--
as
there
was
about
Athens
,
Rome
,
*NL*
Alexandria
,
and
other
old
cities
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
my
dear
girl
,
consider
what
it
is
to
us
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
silent
,
for
she
was
easily
repressed
;
and
then
perceived
*NL*
behind
the
group
of
children
clustered
round
the
model
a
young
man
*NL*
in
a
white
flannel
jacket
,
his
form
being
bent
so
low
in
his
intent
*NL*
inspection
of
the
Valley
of
Jehoshaphat
that
his
face
was
almost
*NL*
hidden
from
view
by
the
Mount
of
Olives
.
``
Look
at
your
cousin
Jude
,
''
*NL*
continued
the
schoolmaster
.
``
He
does
n't
think
we
have
had
enough
of
*NL*
Jerusalem
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
--
I
did
n't
see
him
!
''
she
cried
in
her
quick
,
light
voice
.
*NL*
``
Jude
--
how
seriously
you
are
going
into
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
started
up
from
his
reverie
,
and
saw
her
.
``
Oh
--
Sue
!
''
he
said
,
*NL*
with
a
glad
flush
of
embarrassment
.
``
These
are
your
school-children
,
*NL*
of
course
!
I
saw
that
schools
were
admitted
in
the
afternoons
,
and
*NL*
thought
you
might
come
;
but
I
got
so
deeply
interested
that
I
did
n't
*NL*
remember
where
I
was
.
How
it
carries
one
back
,
does
n't
it
!
I
could
*NL*
examine
it
for
hours
,
but
I
have
only
a
few
minutes
,
unfortunately
;
*NL*
for
I
am
in
the
middle
of
a
job
out
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
cousin
is
so
terribly
clever
that
she
criticizes
it
*NL*
unmercifully
,
''
said
Phillotson
,
with
good-humoured
satire
.
``
She
is
*NL*
quite
sceptical
as
to
its
correctness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Mr.
Phillotson
,
I
am
not
--
altogether
!
I
hate
to
be
what
is
*NL*
called
a
clever
girl
--
there
are
too
many
of
that
sort
now
!
''
answered
*NL*
Sue
sensitively
.
``
I
only
meant
--
I
do
n't
know
what
I
meant
--
except
*NL*
that
it
was
what
you
do
n't
understand
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
I
_
know
your
meaning

''
said
Jude
ardently
-LRB-
although
he
did
not
-RRB-
.
*NL*
``
And
I
think
you
are
quite
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
good
Jude
--
I
know
YOU
believe
in
me
!
''
She
impulsively
*NL*
seized
his
hand
,
and
leaving
a
reproachful
look
on
the
schoolmaster
*NL*
turned
away
to
Jude
,
her
voice
revealing
a
tremor
which
she
herself
*NL*
felt
to
be
absurdly
uncalled
for
by
sarcasm
so
gentle
.
She
had
not
*NL*
the
least
conception
how
the
hearts
of
the
twain
went
out
to
her
at
*NL*
this
momentary
revelation
of
feeling
,
and
what
a
complication
she
was
*NL*
building
up
thereby
in
the
futures
of
both
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
model
wore
too
much
of
an
educational
aspect
for
the
children
not
*NL*
to
tire
of
it
soon
,
and
a
little
later
in
the
afternoon
they
were
all
*NL*
marched
back
to
Lumsdon
,
Jude
returning
to
his
work
.
He
watched
the
*NL*
juvenile
flock
in
their
clean
frocks
and
pinafores
,
filing
down
the
*NL*
street
towards
the
country
beside
Phillotson
and
Sue
,
and
a
sad
,
*NL*
dissatisfied
sense
of
being
out
of
the
scheme
of
the
latters
'
lives
*NL*
had
possession
of
him
.
Phillotson
had
invited
him
to
walk
out
*NL*
and
see
them
on
Friday
evening
,
when
there
would
be
no
lessons
to
*NL*
give
to
Sue
,
and
Jude
had
eagerly
promised
to
avail
himself
of
the
*NL*
opportunity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
the
scholars
and
teachers
moved
homewards
,
and
the
next
*NL*
day
,
on
looking
on
the
blackboard
in
Sue
's
class
,
Phillotson
was
*NL*
surprised
to
find
upon
it
,
skilfully
drawn
in
chalk
,
a
perspective
*NL*
view
of
Jerusalem
,
with
every
building
shown
in
its
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
took
no
interest
in
the
model
,
and
hardly
looked
at
*NL*
it
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hardly
did
,
''
said
she
,
``
but
I
remembered
that
much
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
more
than
I
had
remembered
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
Majesty
's
school-inspector
was
at
that
time
paying
*NL*
``
surprise-visits
''
in
this
neighbourhood
to
test
the
teaching
*NL*
unawares
;
and
two
days
later
,
in
the
middle
of
the
morning
lessons
,
*NL*
the
latch
of
the
door
was
softly
lifted
,
and
in
walked
my
gentleman
,
*NL*
the
king
of
terrors
--
to
pupil-teachers
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
Mr.
Phillotson
the
surprise
was
not
great
;
like
the
lady
in
the
*NL*
story
,
he
had
been
played
that
trick
too
many
times
to
be
unprepared
.
*NL*
But
Sue
's
class
was
at
the
further
end
of
the
room
,
and
her
back
was
*NL*
towards
the
entrance
;
the
inspector
therefore
came
and
stood
behind
*NL*
her
and
watched
her
teaching
some
half-minute
before
she
became
aware
*NL*
of
his
presence
.
She
turned
,
and
realized
that
an
oft-dreaded
moment
*NL*
had
come
.
The
effect
upon
her
timidity
was
such
that
she
uttered
a
*NL*
cry
of
fright
.
Phillotson
,
with
a
strange
instinct
of
solicitude
*NL*
quite
beyond
his
control
,
was
at
her
side
just
in
time
to
prevent
her
*NL*
falling
from
faintness
.
She
soon
recovered
herself
,
and
laughed
;
*NL*
but
when
the
inspector
had
gone
there
was
a
reaction
,
and
she
was
*NL*
so
white
that
Phillotson
took
her
into
his
room
,
and
gave
her
some
*NL*
brandy
to
bring
her
round
.
She
found
him
holding
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ought
to
have
told
me
,
''
she
gasped
petulantly
,
``
that
one
of
the
*NL*
inspector
's
surprise-visits
was
imminent
!
Oh
,
what
shall
I
do
!
Now
*NL*
he
'll
write
and
tell
the
managers
that
I
am
no
good
,
and
I
shall
be
*NL*
disgraced
for
ever
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
wo
n't
do
that
,
my
dear
little
girl
.
You
are
the
best
teacher
*NL*
ever
I
had
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
so
gently
at
her
that
she
was
moved
,
and
regretted
that
she
*NL*
had
upbraided
him
.
When
she
was
better
she
went
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
in
the
meantime
had
been
waiting
impatiently
for
Friday
.
On
*NL*
both
Wednesday
and
Thursday
he
had
been
so
much
under
the
influence
*NL*
of
his
desire
to
see
her
that
he
walked
after
dark
some
distance
*NL*
along
the
road
in
the
direction
of
the
village
,
and
,
on
returning
to
*NL*
his
room
to
read
,
found
himself
quite
unable
to
concentrate
his
mind
*NL*
on
the
page
.
On
Friday
,
as
soon
as
he
had
got
himself
up
as
he
*NL*
thought
Sue
would
like
to
see
him
,
and
made
a
hasty
tea
,
he
set
*NL*
out
,
notwithstanding
that
the
evening
was
wet
.
The
trees
overhead
*NL*
deepened
the
gloom
of
the
hour
,
and
they
dripped
sadly
upon
him
,
*NL*
impressing
him
with
forebodings
--
illogical
forebodings
;
for
though
he
*NL*
knew
that
he
loved
her
he
also
knew
that
he
could
not
be
more
to
her
*NL*
than
he
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
turning
the
corner
and
entering
the
village
the
first
sight
that
*NL*
greeted
his
eyes
was
that
of
two
figures
under
one
umbrella
coming
*NL*
out
of
the
vicarage
gate
.
He
was
too
far
back
for
them
to
notice
*NL*
him
,
but
he
knew
in
a
moment
that
they
were
Sue
and
Phillotson
.
The
*NL*
latter
was
holding
the
umbrella
over
her
head
,
and
they
had
evidently
*NL*
been
paying
a
visit
to
the
vicar
--
probably
on
some
business
connected
*NL*
with
the
school
work
.
And
as
they
walked
along
the
wet
and
deserted
*NL*
lane
Jude
saw
Phillotson
place
his
arm
round
the
girl
's
waist
;
*NL*
whereupon
she
gently
removed
it
;
but
he
replaced
it
;
and
she
let
it
*NL*
remain
,
looking
quickly
round
her
with
an
air
of
misgiving
.
She
did
*NL*
not
look
absolutely
behind
her
,
and
therefore
did
not
see
Jude
,
who
*NL*
sank
into
the
hedge
like
one
struck
with
a
blight
.
There
he
remained
*NL*
hidden
till
they
had
reached
Sue
's
cottage
and
she
had
passed
in
,
*NL*
Phillotson
going
on
to
the
school
hard
by
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
he
's
too
old
for
her
--
too
old
!
''
cried
Jude
in
all
the
terrible
*NL*
sickness
of
hopeless
,
handicapped
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
interfere
.
Was
he
not
Arabella
's
?
He
was
unable
to
*NL*
go
on
further
,
and
retraced
his
steps
towards
Christminster
.
Every
*NL*
tread
of
his
feet
seemed
to
say
to
him
that
he
must
on
no
account
*NL*
stand
in
the
schoolmaster
's
way
with
Sue
.
Phillotson
was
perhaps
*NL*
twenty
years
her
senior
,
but
many
a
happy
marriage
had
been
made
*NL*
in
such
conditions
of
age
.
The
ironical
clinch
to
his
sorrow
was
*NL*
given
by
the
thought
that
the
intimacy
between
his
cousin
and
the
*NL*
schoolmaster
had
been
brought
about
entirely
by
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
's
old
and
embittered
aunt
lay
unwell
at
Marygreen
,
and
on
the
*NL*
following
Sunday
he
went
to
see
her
--
a
visit
which
was
the
result
of
*NL*
a
victorious
struggle
against
his
inclination
to
turn
aside
to
the
*NL*
village
of
Lumsdon
and
obtain
a
miserable
interview
with
his
cousin
,
*NL*
in
which
the
word
nearest
his
heart
could
not
be
spoken
,
and
the
*NL*
sight
which
had
tortured
him
could
not
be
revealed
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
aunt
was
now
unable
to
leave
her
bed
,
and
a
great
part
of
Jude
's
*NL*
short
day
was
occupied
in
making
arrangements
for
her
comfort
.
The
*NL*
little
bakery
business
had
been
sold
to
a
neighbour
,
and
with
the
*NL*
proceeds
of
this
and
her
savings
she
was
comfortably
supplied
with
*NL*
necessaries
and
more
,
a
widow
of
the
same
village
living
with
her
and
*NL*
ministering
to
her
wants
.
It
was
not
till
the
time
had
nearly
come
*NL*
for
him
to
leave
that
he
obtained
a
quiet
talk
with
her
,
and
his
*NL*
words
tended
insensibly
towards
his
cousin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
Sue
born
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
was
--
in
this
room
.
They
were
living
here
at
that
time
.
What
*NL*
made
`
ee
ask
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
I
wanted
to
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
you
've
been
seeing
her
!
''
said
the
harsh
old
woman
.
``
And
what
*NL*
did
I
tell
`
ee
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
that
I
was
not
to
see
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
gossiped
with
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
do
n't
keep
it
up
.
She
was
brought
up
by
her
father
to
hate
her
*NL*
mother
's
family
;
and
she
'll
look
with
no
favour
upon
a
working
chap
*NL*
like
you
--
a
townish
girl
as
she
's
become
by
now
.
I
never
cared
much
*NL*
about
her
.
A
pert
little
thing
,
that
's
what
she
was
too
often
,
with
*NL*
her
tight-strained
nerves
.
Many
's
the
time
I
've
smacked
her
for
her
*NL*
impertinence
.
Why
,
one
day
when
she
was
walking
into
the
pond
with
*NL*
her
shoes
and
stockings
off
,
and
her
petticoats
pulled
above
her
*NL*
knees
,
afore
I
could
cry
out
for
shame
,
she
said
:
`
Move
on
,
Aunty
!
*NL*
This
is
no
sight
for
modest
eyes
!
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
was
a
little
child
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
was
twelve
if
a
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
of
course
.
But
now
she
's
older
she
's
of
a
thoughtful

*NL*
quivering

tender
nature

and
as
sensitive
as

*NL*
*NL*
``

cried
his
aunt
,
springing
up
in
bed
.
``
Do

about

!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

no

*NL*
*NL*
``
Your

about

A
relief
was
afforded
to
him
by
the
entry
of
the
companion
and
nurse
*NL*
of
his
aunt
,
who
must
have
been
listening
to
the
conversation
,
for
*NL*
she
began
a
commentary
on
past
years
,
introducing
Sue
Bridehead
as
*NL*
a
character
in
her
recollections
.
She
described
what
an
odd
little
*NL*
maid
Sue
had
been
when
a
pupil
at
the
village
school
across
the
green
*NL*
opposite
,
before
her
father
went
to
London
--
how
,
when
the
vicar
*NL*
arranged
readings
and
recitations
,
she
appeared
on
the
platform
,
the
*NL*
smallest
of
them
all
,
``
in
her
little
white
frock
,
and
shoes
,
and
pink
*NL*
sash
''
;
how
she
recited
``
Excelsior
,
''
``
There
was
a
sound
of
revelry
by
*NL*
night
,
''
and
``
The
Raven
''
;
how
during
the
delivery
she
would
knit
her
*NL*
little
brows
and
glare
round
tragically
,
and
say
to
the
empty
air
,
as
*NL*
if
some
real
creature
stood
there
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ghastly

grim

and
ancient

*NL*
``
She

bring
up

corroborated
the
*NL*
sick
woman
reluctantly
,
``
as
she
stood
there
in
her
little
sash
and
*NL*
things
,
that

could
see

a

your
very
eyes

You
too
,
*NL*
Jude
,
had
the
same
trick
as
a
child
of
seeming
to
see
things
in
the
*NL*
air

*NL*
*NL*
The
neighbour
told
also
of
Sue
's
accomplishments
in
other
kinds
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
was
not
exactly
a
tomboy
,
you
know
;
but
she
could
do
things
that
*NL*
only
boys
do
,
as
a
rule
.
I
've
seen
her
hit
in
and
steer
down
the
*NL*
long
slide
on
yonder
pond
,
with
her
little
curls
blowing
,
one
of
*NL*
a
file
of
twenty
moving
along
against
the
sky
like
shapes
painted
*NL*
on
glass
,
and
up
the
back
slide
without
stopping
.
All
boys
except
*NL*
herself
;
and
then
they
'd
cheer
her
,
and
then
she
'd
say
,
`
Do
n't
be
*NL*
saucy
,
boys
,
'
and
suddenly
run
indoors
.
They
'd
try
to
coax
her
out
*NL*
again
.
But

a
would
n't
come

*NL*
*NL*
These
retrospective
visions
of
Sue
only
made
Jude
the
more
miserable
*NL*
that
he
was
unable
to
woo
her
,
and
he
left
the
cottage
of
his
aunt
*NL*
that
day
with
a
heavy
heart
.
He
would
fain
have
glanced
into
the
*NL*
school
to
see
the
room
in
which
Sue
's
little
figure
had
so
glorified
*NL*
itself
;
but
he
checked
his
desire
and
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
being
Sunday
evening
some
villagers
who
had
known
him
during
his
*NL*
residence
here
were
standing
in
a
group
in
their
best
clothes
.
Jude
*NL*
was
startled
by
a
salute
from
one
of
them
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye
've
got
there
right
enough
,
then
!

*NL*
*NL*
Jude
showed
that
he
did
not
understand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
to
the
seat
of
l'arning
--
the
`
City
of
Light

used

about

*NL*
*NL*

cried
Jude
.

*NL*
``
When
I
was
there
once
for
an
hour
I

auld
crumbling

half

*NL*
``
You

religion

the
intellectual

spiritual
granary

this
country

*NL*
All
that
silence
and
absence
of
goings-on
is
the
stillness
of
*NL*
infinite
motion
--
the
sleep
of
the
spinning-top
,
to
borrow
the
simile
*NL*
of
a
well-known
writer

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

nothing

the

was
there

went
in

had
a
pot

beer
,
and
a
penny
loaf

and
a

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

said
Jude
.
``
I

almost
as
far
off
that
as

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
so
?

*NL*
*NL*
Jude
slapped
his
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
what
we
thought

places

money

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
you

Jude
,
with
some
bitterness

``
They
are
*NL*
for

ones

''
*NL*
*NL*
Still
,
the
remark
was
sufficient
to
withdraw
Jude
's
attention
from
*NL*
the
imaginative
world
he
had
lately
inhabited
,
in
which
an
abstract
*NL*
figure
,
more
or
less
himself
,
was
steeping
his
mind
in
a
sublimation
*NL*
of
the
arts
and
sciences
,
and
making
his
calling
and
election
sure
*NL*
to
a
seat
in
the
paradise
of
the
learned
.
He
was
set
regarding
his
*NL*
prospects
in
a
cold
northern
light
.
He
had
lately
felt
that
he
*NL*
could
not
quite
satisfy
himself
in
his
Greek
--
in
the
Greek
of
*NL*
the
dramatists
particularly
.
So
fatigued
was
he
sometimes
after
*NL*
his
day
's
work
that
he
could
not
maintain
the
critical
attention
*NL*
necessary
for
thorough
application
.
He
felt
that
he
wanted
a
*NL*
coach
--
a
friend
at
his
elbow
to
tell
him
in
a
moment
what
sometimes
*NL*
would
occupy
him
a
weary
month
in
extracting
from
unanticipative
,
*NL*
clumsy
books
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
decidedly
necessary
to
consider
facts
a
little
more
closely
*NL*
than
he
had
done
of
late
.
What
was
the
good
,
after
all
,
of
using
*NL*
up
his
spare
hours
in
a
vague
labour
called
``
private
study
''
without
*NL*
giving
an
outlook
on
practicabilities
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ought
to
have
thought
of
this
before
,
''
he
said
,
as
he
journeyed
*NL*
back
.
``
It
would
have
been
better
never
to
have
embarked
in
the
*NL*
scheme
at
all
than
to
do
it
without
seeing
clearly
where
I
am
going
,
*NL*
or
what
I
am
aiming
at
...
This
hovering
outside
the
walls
of
the
*NL*
colleges
,
as
if
expecting
some
arm
to
be
stretched
out
from
them
to
*NL*
lift
me
inside

do

I
must

special
information

The
next
week
accordingly
he
sought
it
.
What
at
first
seemed
an
*NL*
opportunity
occurred
one
afternoon
when
he
saw
an
elderly
gentleman
,
*NL*
who
had
been
pointed
out
as
the
head
of
a
particular
college
,
walking
*NL*
in
the
public
path
of
a
parklike
enclosure
near
the
spot
at
which
*NL*
Jude
chanced
to
be
sitting
.
The
gentleman
came
nearer
,
and
Jude
*NL*
looked
anxiously
at
his
face
.
It
seemed
benign
,
considerate
,
yet
*NL*
rather
reserved
.
On
second
thoughts
Jude
felt
that
he
could
not
*NL*
go
up
and
address
him
;
but
he
was
sufficiently
influenced
by
the
*NL*
incident
to
think
what
a
wise
thing
it
would
be
for
him
to
state
his
*NL*
difficulties
by
letter
to
some
of
the
best
and
most
judicious
of
*NL*
these
old
masters
,
and
obtain
their
advice
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
next
week
or
two
he
accordingly
placed
himself
in
such
*NL*
positions
about
the
city
as
would
afford
him
glimpses
of
several
*NL*
of
the
most
distinguished
among
the
provosts
,
wardens
,
and
other
*NL*
heads
of
houses
;
and
from
those
he
ultimately
selected
five
whose
*NL*
physiognomies
seemed
to
say
to
him
that
they
were
appreciative
and
*NL*
far-seeing
men
.
To
these
five
he
addressed
letters
,
briefly
stating
*NL*
his
difficulties
,
and
asking
their
opinion
on
his
stranded
situation
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
letters
were
posted
Jude
mentally
began
to
criticize
*NL*
them
;
he
wished
they
had
not
been
sent
.
``
It
is
just
one
of
those
*NL*
intrusive
,
vulgar
,
pushing
,
applications
which
are
so
common
in
these
*NL*
days
,
''
he
thought
.
``
Why
could
n't
I
know
better
than
address
utter
*NL*
strangers
in
such
a
way
?
I
may
be
an
impostor
,
an
idle
scamp
,
a
man
*NL*
with
a
bad
character
,
for
all
that
they
know
to
the
contrary
...
*NL*
Perhaps
that
's
what
I
am
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
he
found
himself
clinging
to
the
hope
of
some
reply
*NL*
as
to
his
one
last
chance
of
redemption
.
He
waited
day
after
day
,
*NL*
saying
that
it
was
perfectly
absurd
to
expect
,
yet
expecting
.
*NL*
While
he
waited
he
was
suddenly
stirred
by
news
about
Phillotson
.
*NL*
Phillotson
was
giving
up
the
school
near
Christminster
,
for
a
larger
*NL*
one
further
south
,
in
Mid-Wessex
.
What
this
meant
;
how
it
would
*NL*
affect
his
cousin
;
whether
,
as
seemed
possible
,
it
was
a
practical
*NL*
move
of
the
schoolmaster
's
towards
a
larger
income
,
in
view
of
a
*NL*
provision
for
two
instead
of
one
,
he
would
not
allow
himself
to
say
.
*NL*
And
the
tender
relations
between
Phillotson
and
the
young
girl
of
*NL*
whom
Jude
was
passionately
enamoured
effectually
made
it
repugnant
to
*NL*
Jude
's
tastes
to
apply
to
Phillotson
for
advice
on
his
own
scheme
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
the
academic
dignitaries
to
whom
Jude
had
written
*NL*
vouchsafed
no
answer
,
and
the
young
man
was
thus
thrown
back
*NL*
entirely
on
himself
,
as
formerly
,
with
the
added
gloom
of
a
weakened
*NL*
hope
.
By
indirect
inquiries
he
soon
perceived
clearly
what
he
had
*NL*
long
uneasily
suspected
,
that
to
qualify
himself
for
certain
open
*NL*
scholarships
and
exhibitions
was
the
only
brilliant
course
.
But
to
*NL*
do
this
a
good
deal
of
coaching
would
be
necessary
,
and
much
natural
*NL*
ability
.
It
was
next
to
impossible
that
a
man
reading
on
his
own
*NL*
system
,
however
widely
and
thoroughly
,
even
over
the
prolonged
period
*NL*
of
ten
years
,
should
be
able
to
compete
with
those
who
had
passed
*NL*
their
lives
under
trained
teachers
and
had
worked
to
ordained
lines
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
course
,
that
of
buying
himself
in
,
so
to
speak
,
seemed
the
*NL*
only
one
really
open
to
men
like
him
,
the
difficulty
being
simply
of
*NL*
a
material
kind
.
With
the
help
of
his
information
he
began
to
reckon
*NL*
the
extent
of
this
material
obstacle
,
and
ascertained
,
to
his
dismay
,
*NL*
that
,
at
the
rate
at
which
,
with
the
best
of
fortune
,
he
would
be
*NL*
able
to
save
money
,
fifteen
years
must
elapse
before
he
could
be
in
a
*NL*
position
to
forward
testimonials
to
the
head
of
a
college
and
advance
*NL*
to
a
matriculation
examination
.
The
undertaking
was
hopeless
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
saw
what
a
curious
and
cunning
glamour
the
neighbourhood
of
the
*NL*
place
had
exercised
over
him
.
To
get
there
and
live
there
,
to
move
*NL*
among
the
churches
and
halls
and
become
imbued
with
the
_
genius
*NL*
loci
_
,
had
seemed
to
his
dreaming
youth
,
as
the
spot
shaped
its
*NL*
charms
to
him
from
its
halo
on
the
horizon
,
the
obvious
and
ideal
*NL*
thing
to
do
.
``
Let
me
only
get
there
,
''
he
had
said
with
the
*NL*
fatuousness
of
Crusoe
over
his
big
boat
,
``
and
the
rest
is
but
a
*NL*
matter
of
time
and
energy
.
''
It
would
have
been
far
better
for
him
in
*NL*
every
way
if
he
had
never
come
within
sight
and
sound
of
the
delusive
*NL*
precincts
,
had
gone
to
some
busy
commercial
town
with
the
sole
object
*NL*
of
making
money
by
his
wits
,
and
thence
surveyed
his
plan
in
true
*NL*
perspective
.
Well
,
all
that
was
clear
to
him
amounted
to
this
,
that
*NL*
the
whole
scheme
had
burst
up
,
like
an
iridescent
soap-bubble
,
under
*NL*
the
touch
of
a
reasoned
inquiry
.
He
looked
back
at
himself
along
the
*NL*
vista
of
his
past
years
,
and
his
thought
was
akin
to
Heine
's
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Above
the
youth
's
inspired
and
flashing
eyes
*NL*
I
see
the
motley
mocking
fool
's
-
cap
rise
!
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Fortunately
he
had
not
been
allowed
to
bring
his
disappointment
into
*NL*
his
dear
Sue
's
life
by
involving
her
in
this
collapse
.
And
the
*NL*
painful
details
of
his
awakening
to
a
sense
of
his
limitations
should
*NL*
now
be
spared
her
as
far
as
possible
.
After
all
,
she
had
only
known
*NL*
a
little
part
of
the
miserable
struggle
in
which
he
had
been
engaged
*NL*
thus
unequipped
,
poor
,
and
unforeseeing
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
always
remembered
the
appearance
of
the
afternoon
on
which
he
*NL*
awoke
from
his
dream
.
Not
quite
knowing
what
to
do
with
himself
,
he
*NL*
went
up
to
an
octagonal
chamber
in
the
lantern
of
a
singularly
built
*NL*
theatre
that
was
set
amidst
this
quaint
and
singular
city
.
It
had
*NL*
windows
all
round
,
from
which
an
outlook
over
the
whole
town
and
*NL*
its
edifices
could
be
gained
.
Jude
's
eyes
swept
all
the
views
in
*NL*
succession
,
meditatively
,
mournfully
,
yet
sturdily
.
Those
buildings
*NL*
and
their
associations
and
privileges
were
not
for
him
.
From
the
*NL*
looming
roof
of
the
great
library
,
into
which
he
hardly
ever
had
time
*NL*
to
enter
,
his
gaze
travelled
on
to
the
varied
spires
,
halls
,
gables
,
*NL*
streets
,
chapels
,
gardens
,
quadrangles
,
which
composed
the
ensemble
*NL*
of
this
unrivalled
panorama
.
He
saw
that
his
destiny
lay
not
with
*NL*
these
,
but
among
the
manual
toilers
in
the
shabby
purlieu
which
he
*NL*
himself
occupied
,
unrecognized
as
part
of
the
city
at
all
by
its
*NL*
visitors
and
panegyrists
,
yet
without
whose
denizens
the
hard
readers
*NL*
could
not
read
nor
the
high
thinkers
live
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
over
the
town
into
the
country
beyond
,
to
the
trees
which
*NL*
screened
her
whose
presence
had
at
first
been
the
support
of
his
*NL*
heart
,
and
whose
loss
was
now
a
maddening
torture
.
But
for
this
blow
*NL*
he
might
have
borne
with
his
fate
.
With
Sue
as
companion
he
could
*NL*
have
renounced
his
ambitions
with
a
smile
.
Without
her
it
was
*NL*
inevitable
that
the
reaction
from
the
long
strain
to
which
he
had
*NL*
subjected
himself
should
affect
him
disastrously
.
Phillotson
had
*NL*
no
doubt
passed
through
a
similar
intellectual
disappointment
to
*NL*
that
which
now
enveloped
him
.
But
the
schoolmaster
had
been
since
*NL*
blest
with
the
consolation
of
sweet
Sue
,
while
for
him
there
was
no
*NL*
consoler
.
*NL*
*NL*
Descending
to
the
streets
,
he
went
listlessly
along
till
he
arrived
*NL*
at
an
inn
,
and
entered
it
.
Here
he
drank
several
glasses
of
beer
in
*NL*
rapid
succession
,
and
when
he
came
out
it
was
night
.
By
the
light
of
*NL*
the
flickering
lamps
he
rambled
home
to
supper
,
and
had
not
long
been
*NL*
sitting
at
table
when
his
landlady
brought
up
a
letter
that
had
just
*NL*
arrived
for
him
.
She
laid
it
down
as
if
impressed
with
a
sense
of
*NL*
its
possible
importance
,
and
on
looking
at
it
Jude
perceived
that
it
*NL*
bore
the
embossed
stamp
of
one
of
the
colleges
whose
heads
he
had
*NL*
addressed
.
``
ONE
--
at
last
!
''
cried
Jude
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
communication
was
brief
,
and
not
exactly
what
he
had
expected
;
*NL*
though
it
really
was
from
the
master
in
person
.
It
ran
thus
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
BIBLIOLL
COLLEGE
.
*NL*
*NL*
SIR
,
--
I
have
read
your
letter
with
interest
;
and
,
judging
*NL*
from
your
description
of
yourself
as
a
working-man
,
I
*NL*
venture
to
think
that
you
will
have
a
much
better
chance
*NL*
of
success
in
life
by
remaining
in
your
own
sphere
and
*NL*
sticking
to
your
trade
than
by
adopting
any
other
course
.
*NL*
That
,
therefore
,
is
what
I
advise
you
to
do
.
Yours
*NL*
faithfully
,
*NL*
*NL*
T.
TETUPHENAY
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
Mr.
J.
FAWLEY
,
Stone-mason
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
This
terribly
sensible
advice
exasperated
Jude
.
He
had
known
all
*NL*
that
before
.
He
knew
it
was
true
.
Yet
it
seemed
a
hard
slap
after
*NL*
ten
years
of
labour
,
and
its
effect
upon
him
just
now
was
to
make
him
*NL*
rise
recklessly
from
the
table
,
and
,
instead
of
reading
as
usual
,
to
*NL*
go
downstairs
and
into
the
street
.
He
stood
at
a
bar
and
tossed
off
*NL*
two
or
three
glasses
,
then
unconsciously
sauntered
along
till
he
*NL*
came
to
a
spot
called
The
Fourways
in
the
middle
of
the
city
,
gazing
*NL*
abstractedly
at
the
groups
of
people
like
one
in
a
trance
,
till
,
*NL*
coming
to
himself
,
he
began
talking
to
the
policeman
fixed
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
officer
yawned
,
stretched
out
his
elbows
,
elevated
himself
*NL*
an
inch
and
a
half
on
the
balls
of
his
toes
,
smiled
,
and
looking
*NL*
humorously
at
Jude
,
said
,
``
You
've
had
a
wet
,
young
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
've
only
begun
,
''
he
replied
cynically
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whatever
his
wetness
,
his
brains
were
dry
enough
.
He
only
heard
in
*NL*
part
the
policeman
's
further
remarks
,
having
fallen
into
thought
on
*NL*
what
struggling
people
like
himself
had
stood
at
that
crossway
,
whom
*NL*
nobody
ever
thought
of
now
.
It
had
more
history
than
the
oldest
*NL*
college
in
the
city
.
It
was
literally
teeming
,
stratified
,
with
the
*NL*
shades
of
human
groups
,
who
had
met
there
for
tragedy
,
comedy
,
farce
;
*NL*
real
enactments
of
the
intensest
kind
.
At
Fourways
men
had
stood
*NL*
and
talked
of
Napoleon
,
the
loss
of
America
,
the
execution
of
King
*NL*
Charles
,
the
burning
of
the
Martyrs
,
the
Crusades
,
the
Norman
*NL*
Conquest
,
possibly
of
the
arrival
of
Caesar
.
Here
the
two
sexes
had
*NL*
met
for
loving
,
hating
,
coupling
,
parting
;
had
waited
,
had
suffered
,
*NL*
for
each
other
;
had
triumphed
over
each
other
;
cursed
each
other
in
*NL*
jealousy
,
blessed
each
other
in
forgiveness
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
began
to
see
that
the
town
life
was
a
book
of
humanity
infinitely
*NL*
more
palpitating
,
varied
,
and
compendious
than
the
gown
life
.
*NL*
These
struggling
men
and
women
before
him
were
the
reality
of
*NL*
Christminster
,
though
they
knew
little
of
Christ
or
Minster
.
*NL*
That
was
one
of
the
humours
of
things
.
The
floating
population
*NL*
of
students
and
teachers
,
who
did
know
both
in
a
way
,
were
not
*NL*
Christminster
in
a
local
sense
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
his
watch
,
and
,
in
pursuit
of
this
idea
,
he
went
on
till
*NL*
he
came
to
a
public
hall
,
where
a
promenade
concert
was
in
progress
.
*NL*
Jude
entered
,
and
found
the
room
full
of
shop
youths
and
girls
,
*NL*
soldiers
,
apprentices
,
boys
of
eleven
smoking
cigarettes
,
and
light
*NL*
women
of
the
more
respectable
and
amateur
class
.
He
had
tapped
the
*NL*
real
Christminster
life
.
A
band
was
playing
,
and
the
crowd
walked
*NL*
about
and
jostled
each
other
,
and
every
now
and
then
a
man
got
upon
*NL*
a
platform
and
sang
a
comic
song
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
spirit
of
Sue
seemed
to
hover
round
him
and
prevent
his
flirting
*NL*
and
drinking
with
the
frolicsome
girls
who
made
advances
--
wistful
*NL*
to
gain
a
little
joy
.
At
ten
o'clock
he
came
away
,
choosing
a
*NL*
circuitous
route
homeward
to
pass
the
gates
of
the
college
whose
head
*NL*
had
just
sent
him
the
note
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gates
were
shut
,
and
,
by
an
impulse
,
he
took
from
his
pocket
the
*NL*
lump
of
chalk
which
as
a
workman
he
usually
carried
there
,
and
wrote
*NL*
along
the
wall
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
I
have
understanding
as
well
as
you
;
I
am
not
inferior
to
you
:
*NL*
yea
,
who
knoweth
not
such
things
as
these
?

The
stroke
of
scorn
relieved
his
mind
,
and
the
next
morning
he
*NL*
laughed
at
his
self-conceit
.
But
the
laugh
was
not
a
healthy
one
.
*NL*
He
re-read
the
letter
from
the
master
,
and
the
wisdom
in
its
lines
,
*NL*
which
had
at
first
exasperated
him
,
chilled
and
depressed
him
now
.
*NL*
He
saw
himself
as
a
fool
indeed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Deprived
of
the
objects
of
both
intellect
and
emotion
,
he
could
not
*NL*
proceed
to
his
work
.
Whenever
he
felt
reconciled
to
his
fate
as
a
*NL*
student
,
there
came
to
disturb
his
calm
his
hopeless
relations
with
*NL*
Sue
.
That
the
one
affined
soul
he
had
ever
met
was
lost
to
him
*NL*
through
his
marriage
returned
upon
him
with
cruel
persistency
,
till
,
*NL*
unable
to
bear
it
longer
,
he
again
rushed
for
distraction
to
the
*NL*
real
Christminster
life
.
He
now
sought
it
out
in
an
obscure
and
*NL*
low-ceiled
tavern
up
a
court
which
was
well
known
to
certain
worthies
*NL*
of
the
place
,
and
in
brighter
times
would
have
interested
him
simply
*NL*
by
its
quaintness
.
Here
he
sat
more
or
less
all
the
day
,
convinced
*NL*
that
he
was
at
bottom
a
vicious
character
,
of
whom
it
was
hopeless
to
*NL*
expect
anything
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
the
frequenters
of
the
house
dropped
in
one
by
one
,
*NL*
Jude
still
retaining
his
seat
in
the
corner
,
though
his
money
was
all
*NL*
spent
,
and
he
had
not
eaten
anything
the
whole
day
except
a
biscuit
.
*NL*
He
surveyed
his
gathering
companions
with
all
the
equanimity
*NL*
and
philosophy
of
a
man
who
has
been
drinking
long
and
slowly
,
*NL*
and
made
friends
with
several
:
to
wit
,
Tinker
Taylor
,
a
decayed
*NL*
church-ironmonger
who
appeared
to
have
been
of
a
religious
turn
in
*NL*
earlier
years
,
but
was
somewhat
blasphemous
now
;
also
a
red-nosed
*NL*
auctioneer
;
also
two
Gothic
masons
like
himself
,
called
Uncle
Jim
and
*NL*
Uncle
Joe
.
There
were
present
,
too
,
some
clerks
,
and
a
gown
-
and
*NL*
surplice-maker
's
assistant
;
two
ladies
who
sported
moral
characters
*NL*
of
various
depths
of
shade
,
according
to
their
company
,
nicknamed
*NL*
``
Bower
o
'
Bliss
''
and
``
Freckles
''
;
some
horsey
men
``
in
the
know
''
*NL*
of
betting
circles
;
a
travelling
actor
from
the
theatre
,
and
two
*NL*
devil-may-care
young
men
who
proved
to
be
gownless
undergraduates
;
*NL*
they
had
slipped
in
by
stealth
to
meet
a
man
about
bull-pups
,
*NL*
and
stayed
to
drink
and
smoke
short
pipes
with
the
racing
gents
*NL*
aforesaid
,
looking
at
their
watches
every
now
and
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
conversation
waxed
general
.
Christminster
society
was
*NL*
criticized
,
the
dons
,
magistrates
,
and
other
people
in
authority
*NL*
being
sincerely
pitied
for
their
shortcomings
,
while
opinions
on
how
*NL*
they
ought
to
conduct
themselves
and
their
affairs
to
be
properly
*NL*
respected
,
were
exchanged
in
a
large-minded
and
disinterested
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
Fawley
,
with
the
self-conceit
,
effrontery
,
and
_
aplomb
_
of
*NL*
a
strong-brained
fellow
in
liquor
,
threw
in
his
remarks
somewhat
*NL*
peremptorily
;
and
his
aims
having
been
what
they
were
for
so
many
*NL*
years
,
everything
the
others
said
turned
upon
his
tongue
,
by
a
sort
*NL*
of
mechanical
craze
,
to
the
subject
of
scholarship
and
study
,
the
*NL*
extent
of
his
own
learning
being
dwelt
upon
with
an
insistence
that
*NL*
would
have
appeared
pitiable
to
himself
in
his
sane
hours
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
care
a
damn
,
''
he
was
saying
,
``
for
any
provost
,
warden
,
*NL*
principal
,
fellow
,
or
cursed
master
of
arts
in
the
university

What
*NL*
I
know
is
that
I
'd
lick
'em
on
their
own
ground
if
they
'd
give
me
a
*NL*
chance
,
and
show
'em
a
few
things
they
are
not
up
to
yet
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hear
,
hear
!
''
said
the
undergraduates
from
the
corner
,
where
they
*NL*
were
talking
privately
about
the
pups
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
always
was
fond
o
'
books
,
I
've
heard
,
''
said
Tinker
Taylor
,
``
and
*NL*
I
do
n't
doubt
what
you
state
.
Now
with
me
't
was
different
.
I
always
*NL*
saw
there
was
more
to
be
learnt
outside
a
book
than
in
;
and
I
took
my
*NL*
steps
accordingly
,
or
I
should
n't
have
been
the
man
I
am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
aim
at
the
Church
,
I
believe
?
''
said
Uncle
Joe
.
``
If
you
are
such
*NL*
a
scholar
as
to
pitch
yer
hopes
so
high
as
that
,
why
not
give
us
a
*NL*
specimen
of
your
scholarship
?
Canst
say
the
Creed

Latin

*NL*
That
was
how
they
once
put
it
to
a
chap
down
in
my
country

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
so
!
''
said
Jude
haughtily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
he
!
Like
his
conceit

screamed
one
of
the
ladies
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
you
shut
up
,
Bower
o

Bliss
!
''
said
one
of
the
undergraduates
.
*NL*
``
Silence
!
''
He
drank
off
the
spirits
in
his
tumbler
,
rapped
with
it
*NL*
on
the
counter
,
and
announced
,
``
The
gentleman
in
the
corner

*NL*
*NL*
``

Jude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

the
surplice-maker

Uncle

*NL*

*NL*
``

Jude

``
Well

I
'll
do
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
fair
offer
,
''
said
the
undergraduate
,
throwing
down
the
*NL*
money
for
the
whisky
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
barmaid
concocted
the
mixture
with
the
bearing
of
a
person
*NL*
compelled
to
live
amongst
animals
of
an
inferior
species
,
and
the
*NL*
glass
was
handed
across
to
Jude
,
who
,
having
drunk
the
contents
,
*NL*
stood
up
and
began
rhetorically
,
without
hesitation
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Credo

_
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
!
Excellent
Latin
!
''
cried
one
of
the
undergraduates
,
who
,
*NL*
however
,
had
not
the
slightest
conception
of
a
single
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
silence
reigned
among
the
rest
in
the
bar
,
and
the
maid
stood
*NL*
still
,
Jude
's
voice
echoing
sonorously
into
the
inner
parlour
,
where
*NL*
the
landlord
was
dozing
,
and
bringing
him
out
to
see
what
was
going
*NL*
on
.
Jude
had
declaimed
steadily
ahead
,
and
was
continuing
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
_

*NL*
*NL*
``

sneered
the
second
undergraduate
.
``
And
we
*NL*
wanted
the

!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let

''
said
the
auctioneer
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Jude
's
mind
seemed
to
grow
confused
soon
,
and
he
could
not
get
*NL*
on
.
He
put
his
hand
to
his
forehead
,
and
his
face
assumed
an
*NL*
expression
of
pain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
him
another
glass
--
then
he
'll
fetch
up
and
get
through
it

*NL*
said
Tinker
Taylor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Somebody
threw
down
threepence
,
the
glass
was
handed
,
Jude
stretched
*NL*
out
his
arm
for
it
without
looking
,
and
having
swallowed
the
liquor
,
*NL*
went
on
in
a
moment
in
a
revived
voice
,
raising
it
as
he
neared
the
*NL*
end
with
the
manner
of
a
priest
leading
a
congregation
:
*NL*
*NL*

_
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
done

''
said
several
,
enjoying
the
last
word
,
as
being
the
first
*NL*
and
only
one
they
had
recognized
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Jude
seemed
to
shake
the
fumes
from
his
brain
,
as
he
stared
*NL*
round
upon
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
pack
of
fools

he
cried
.
``
Which
one
of
you
knows
whether
I

have
been

Daughter

double
Dutch
for
all
that
your
besotted
heads
can
tell
!
See
what
*NL*
I
have
brought
myself
to

the
crew
I

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
landlord
,
who
had
already
had
his
license
endorsed
for
harbouring
*NL*
queer
characters
,
feared
a
riot
,
and
came
outside
the
counter
;
but
*NL*
Jude
,
in
his
sudden
flash
of
reason
,
had
turned
in
disgust
and
left
*NL*
the
scene
,
the
door
slamming
with
a
dull
thud
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
hastened
down
the
lane
and
round
into
the
straight
broad
street
,
*NL*
which
he
followed
till
it
merged
in
the
highway
,
and
all
sound
of
his
*NL*
late
companions
had
been
left
behind
.
Onward
he
still
went
,
under
*NL*
the
influence
of
a
childlike
yearning
for
the
one
being
in
the
world
*NL*
to
whom
it
seemed
possible
to
fly
--
an
unreasoning
desire
,
whose
ill
*NL*
judgement
was
not
apparent
to
him
now
.
In
the
course
of
an
hour
,
*NL*
when
it
was
between
ten
and
eleven
o'clock
,
he
entered
the
village
of
*NL*
Lumsdon
,
and
reaching
the
cottage
,
saw
that
a
light
was
burning
in
*NL*
a
downstairs
room
,
which
he
assumed
,
rightly
as
it
happened
,
to
be
*NL*
hers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
stepped
close
to
the
wall
,
and
tapped
with
his
finger
on
the
*NL*
pane
,
saying
impatiently
,
``
Sue
,
Sue
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
must
have
recognized
his
voice
,
for
the
light
disappeared
from
*NL*
the
apartment
,
and
in
a
second
or
two
the
door
was
unlocked
and
*NL*
opened
,
and
Sue
appeared
with
a
candle
in
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
Jude
?
Yes
,
it
is
!
My
dear
,
dear
cousin
,
what
's
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
am
--
I
could
n't
help
coming
,
Sue
!
''
said
he
,
sinking
down
upon
*NL*
the
doorstep
.
``
I
am
so
wicked
,
Sue
--
my
heart
is
nearly
broken
,
*NL*
and
I
could
not
bear
my
life
as
it
was
!
So
I
have
been
drinking
,
*NL*
and
blaspheming
,
or
next
door
to
it
,
and
saying
holy
things
in
*NL*
disreputable
quarters
--
repeating
in
idle
bravado
words
which
ought
*NL*
never
to
be
uttered
but
reverently
!
Oh
,
do
anything
with
me
,
*NL*
Sue
--
kill
me
--
I
do
n't
care
!
Only
do
n't
hate
me
and
despise
me
like
*NL*
all
the
rest
of
the
world
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
ill
,
poor
dear
!
No
,
I
wo
n't
despise
you
;
of
course
I
wo
n't
!
*NL*
Come
in
and
rest
,
and
let
me
see
what
I
can
do
for
you
.
Now
lean
on
*NL*
me
,
and
do
n't
mind
.
''
With
one
hand
holding
the
candle
and
the
other
*NL*
supporting
him
,
she
led
him
indoors
,
and
placed
him
in
the
only
easy
*NL*
chair
the
meagrely
furnished
house
afforded
,
stretching
his
feet
upon
*NL*
another
,
and
pulling
off
his
boots
.
Jude
,
now
getting
towards
his
*NL*
sober
senses
,
could
only
say
,
``
Dear
,
dear
Sue
!
''
in
a
voice
broken
by
*NL*
grief
and
contrition
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
asked
him
if
he
wanted
anything
to
eat
,
but
he
shook
his
head
.
*NL*
Then
telling
him
to
go
to
sleep
,
and
that
she
would
come
down
early
*NL*
in
the
morning
and
get
him
some
breakfast
,
she
bade
him
good-night
*NL*
and
ascended
the
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Almost
immediately
he
fell
into
a
heavy
slumber
,
and
did
not
wake
*NL*
till
dawn
.
At
first
he
did
not
know
where
he
was
,
but
by
degrees
his
*NL*
situation
cleared
to
him
,
and
he
beheld
it
in
all
the
ghastliness
*NL*
of
a
right
mind
.
She
knew
the
worst
of
him
--
the
very
worst
.
How
*NL*
could
he
face
her
now
?
She
would
soon
be
coming
down
to
see
about
*NL*
breakfast
,
as
she
had
said
,
and
there
would
he
be
in
all
his
shame
*NL*
confronting
her
.
He
could
not
bear
the
thought
,
and
softly
drawing
*NL*
on
his
boots
,
and
taking
his
hat
from
the
nail
on
which
she
had
hung
*NL*
it
,
he
slipped
noiselessly
out
of
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
fixed
idea
was
to
get
away
to
some
obscure
spot
and
hide
,
and
*NL*
perhaps
pray
;
and
the
only
spot
which
occurred
to
him
was
Marygreen
.
*NL*
He
called
at
his
lodging
in
Christminster
,
where
he
found
awaiting
*NL*
him
a
note
of
dismissal
from
his
employer
;
and
having
packed
up
he
*NL*
turned
his
back
upon
the
city
that
had
been
such
a
thorn
in
his
*NL*
side
,
and
struck
southward
into
Wessex
.
He
had
no
money
left
in
*NL*
his
pocket
,
his
small
savings
,
deposited
at
one
of
the
banks
in
*NL*
Christminster
,
having
fortunately
been
left
untouched
.
To
get
to
*NL*
Marygreen
,
therefore
,
his
only
course
was
walking
;
and
the
distance
*NL*
being
nearly
twenty
miles
,
he
had
ample
time
to
complete
on
the
way
*NL*
the
sobering
process
begun
in
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
some
hour
of
the
evening
he
reached
Alfredston
.
Here
he
pawned
*NL*
his
waistcoat
,
and
having
gone
out
of
the
town
a
mile
or
two
,
slept
*NL*
under
a
rick
that
night
.
At
dawn
he
rose
,
shook
off
the
hayseeds
and
*NL*
stems
from
his
clothes
,
and
started
again
,
breasting
the
long
white
*NL*
road
up
the
hill
to
the
downs
,
which
had
been
visible
to
him
a
long
*NL*
way
off
,
and
passing
the
milestone
at
the
top
,
whereon
he
had
carved
*NL*
his
hopes
years
ago
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
reached
the
ancient
hamlet
while
the
people
were
at
breakfast
.
*NL*
Weary
and
mud-bespattered
,
but
quite
possessed
of
his
ordinary
*NL*
clearness
of
brain
,
he
sat
down
by
the
well
,
thinking
as
he
did
so
*NL*
what
a
poor
Christ
he
made
.
Seeing
a
trough
of
water
near
he
bathed
*NL*
his
face
,
and
went
on
to
the
cottage
of
his
great-aunt
,
whom
he
found
*NL*
breakfasting
in
bed
,
attended
by
the
woman
who
lived
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
--
out
o
'
work
?
''
asked
his
relative
,
regarding
him
through
eyes
*NL*
sunken
deep
,
under
lids
heavy
as
pot-covers
,
no
other
cause
for
his
*NL*
tumbled
appearance
suggesting
itself
to
one
whose
whole
life
had
been
*NL*
a
struggle
with
material
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Jude
heavily
.
``
I
think
I
must
have
a
little
rest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Refreshed
by
some
breakfast
,
he
went
up
to
his
old
room
and
lay
down
*NL*
in
his
shirt-sleeves
,
after
the
manner
of
the
artizan
.
He
fell
*NL*
asleep
for
a
short
while
,
and
when
he
awoke
it
was
as
if
he
had
*NL*
awakened
in
hell
.
It
WAS
hell
--
``
the
hell
of
conscious
failure
,
''
both
*NL*
in
ambition
and
in
love
.
He
thought
of
that
previous
abyss
into
*NL*
which
he
had
fallen
before
leaving
this
part
of
the
country
;
the
*NL*
deepest
deep
he
had
supposed
it
then
;
but
it
was
not
so
deep
as
this
.
*NL*
That
had
been
the
breaking
in
of
the
outer
bulwarks
of
his
hope
:
*NL*
this
was
of
his
second
line
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
he
had
been
a
woman
he
must
have
screamed
under
the
nervous
*NL*
tension
which
he
was
now
undergoing
.
But
that
relief
being
denied
to
*NL*
his
virility
,
he
clenched
his
teeth
in
misery
,
bringing
lines
about
*NL*
his
mouth
like
those
in
the
Laocoon
,
and
corrugations
between
his
*NL*
brows
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
mournful
wind
blew
through
the
trees
,
and
sounded
in
the
chimney
*NL*
like
the
pedal
notes
of
an
organ
.
Each
ivy
leaf
overgrowing
the
wall
*NL*
of
the
churchless
church-yard
hard
by
,
now
abandoned
,
pecked
its
*NL*
neighbour
smartly
,
and
the
vane
on
the
new
Victorian-Gothic
church
in
*NL*
the
new
spot
had
already
begun
to
creak
.
Yet
apparently
it
was
not
*NL*
always
the
outdoor
wind
that
made
the
deep
murmurs
;
it
was
a
voice
.
*NL*
He
guessed
its
origin
in
a
moment
or
two
;
the
curate
was
praying
with
*NL*
his
aunt
in
the
adjoining
room
.
He
remembered
her
speaking
of
him
.
*NL*
Presently
the
sounds
ceased
,
and
a
step
seemed
to
cross
the
landing
.
*NL*
Jude
sat
up
,
and
shouted
``
Hoi
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
step
made
for
his
door
,
which
was
open
,
and
a
man
looked
in
.
*NL*
It
was
a
young
clergyman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
are
Mr.
Highridge
,
''
said
Jude
.
``
My
aunt
has
mentioned
*NL*
you
more
than
once
.
Well
,
here
I
am
,
just
come
home
;
a
fellow
gone
*NL*
to
the
bad
;
though
I
had
the
best
intentions
in
the
world
at
one
*NL*
time
.
Now
I
am
melancholy
mad
,
what
with
drinking
and
one
thing
and
*NL*
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Slowly
Jude
unfolded
to
the
curate
his
late
plans
and
movements
,
by
*NL*
an
unconscious
bias
dwelling
less
upon
the
intellectual
and
ambitious
*NL*
side
of
his
dream
,
and
more
upon
the
theological
,
though
this
had
,
up
*NL*
till
now
,
been
merely
a
portion
of
the
general
plan
of
advancement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
I
know
I
have
been
a
fool
,
and
that
folly
is
with
me
,
''
added
*NL*
Jude
in
conclusion
.
``
And
I
do
n't
regret
the
collapse
of
my
*NL*
university
hopes
one
jot
.
I
would
n't
begin
again
if
I
were
sure
to
*NL*
succeed
.
I
do
n't
care
for
social
success
any
more
at
all
.
But
I
do
*NL*
feel
I
should
like
to
do
some
good
thing
;
and
I
bitterly
regret
the
*NL*
Church
,
and
the
loss
of
my
chance
of
being
her
ordained
minister
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
curate
,
who
was
a
new
man
to
this
neighbourhood
,
had
grown
deeply
*NL*
interested
,
and
at
last
he
said
:
``
If
you
feel
a
real
call
to
the
*NL*
ministry
,
and
I
wo
n't
say
from
your
conversation
that
you
do
not
,
*NL*
for
it
is
that
of
a
thoughtful
and
educated
man
,
you
might
enter
the
*NL*
Church
as
a
licentiate
.
Only
you
must
make
up
your
mind
to
avoid
*NL*
strong
drink
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
avoid
that
easily
enough
,
if
I
had
any
kind
of
hope
to
*NL*
support
me
!

H.

Wharton

.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
new
idea
--
the
ecclesiastical
and
altruistic
life
as
distinct
*NL*
from
the
intellectual
and
emulative
life
.
A
man
could
preach
and
*NL*
do
good
to
his
fellow-creatures
without
taking
double-firsts
in
the
*NL*
schools
of
Christminster
,
or
having
anything
but
ordinary
knowledge
.
*NL*
The
old
fancy
which
had
led
on
to
the
culminating
vision
of
the
*NL*
bishopric
had
not
been
an
ethical
or
theological
enthusiasm
at
all
,
*NL*
but
a
mundane
ambition
masquerading
in
a
surplice
.
He
feared
that
*NL*
his
whole
scheme
had
degenerated
to
,
even
though
it
might
not
have
*NL*
originated
in
,
a
social
unrest
which
had
no
foundation
in
the
nobler
*NL*
instincts
;
which
was
purely
an
artificial
product
of
civilization
.
*NL*
There
were
thousands
of
young
men
on
the
same
self-seeking
track
*NL*
at
the
present
moment
.
The
sensual
hind
who
ate
,
drank
,
and
lived
*NL*
carelessly
with
his
wife
through
the
days
of
his
vanity
was
a
more
*NL*
likable
being
than
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
to
enter
the
Church
in
such
an
unscholarly
way
that
he
could
not
*NL*
in
any
probability
rise
to
a
higher
grade
through
all
his
career
than
*NL*
that
of
the
humble
curate
wearing
his
life
out
in
an
obscure
village
*NL*
or
city
slum
--
that
might
have
a
touch
of
goodness
and
greatness
in
*NL*
it
;
that
might
be
true
religion
,
and
a
purgatorial
course
worthy
of
*NL*
being
followed
by
a
remorseful
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
favourable
light
in
which
this
new
thought
showed
itself
by
*NL*
contrast
with
his
foregone
intentions
cheered
Jude
,
as
he
sat
there
,
*NL*
shabby
and
lonely
;
and
it
may
be
said
to
have
given
,
during
the
next
*NL*
few
days
,
the
_
coup
de
grace
_
to
his
intellectual
career
--
a
career
*NL*
which
had
extended
over
the
greater
part
of
a
dozen
years
.
He
did
*NL*
nothing
,
however
,
for
some
long
stagnant
time
to
advance
his
new
*NL*
desire
,
occupying
himself
with
little
local
jobs
in
putting
up
and
*NL*
lettering
headstones
about
the
neighbouring
villages
,
and
submitting
*NL*
to
be
regarded
as
a
social
failure
,
a
returned
purchase
,
by
the
*NL*
half-dozen
or
so
of
farmers
and
other
country-people
who
condescended
*NL*
to
nod
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
human
interest
of
the
new
intention
--
and
a
human
interest
is
*NL*
indispensable
to
the
most
spiritual
and
self-sacrificing
--
was
created
*NL*
by
a
letter
from
Sue
,
bearing
a
fresh
postmark
.
She
evidently
*NL*
wrote
with
anxiety
,
and
told
very
little
about
her
own
doings
,
more
*NL*
than
that
she
had
passed
some
sort
of
examination
for
a
Queen
's
*NL*
Scholarship
,
and
was
going
to
enter
a
training
college
at
Melchester
*NL*
to
complete
herself
for
the
vocation
she
had
chosen
,
partly
by
his
*NL*
influence
.
There
was
a
theological
college
at
Melchester
;
Melchester
*NL*
was
a
quiet
and
soothing
place
,
almost
entirely
ecclesiastical
in
its
*NL*
tone
;
a
spot
where
worldly
learning
and
intellectual
smartness
had
no
*NL*
establishment
;
where
the
altruistic
feeling
that
he
did
possess
would
*NL*
perhaps
be
more
highly
estimated
than
a
brilliancy
which
he
did
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
it
would
be
necessary
that
he
should
continue
for
a
time
to
work
*NL*
at
his
trade
while
reading
up
Divinity
,
which
he
had
neglected
at
*NL*
Christminster
for
the
ordinary
classical
grind
,
what
better
course
*NL*
for
him
than
to
get
employment
at
the
further
city
,
and
pursue
this
*NL*
plan
of
reading
?
That
his
excessive
human
interest
in
the
new
place
*NL*
was
entirely
of
Sue
's
making
,
while
at
the
same
time
Sue
was
to
be
*NL*
regarded
even
less
than
formerly
as
proper
to
create
it
,
had
an
*NL*
ethical
contradictoriness
to
which
he
was
not
blind
.
But
that
much
*NL*
he
conceded
to
human
frailty
,
and
hoped
to
learn
to
love
her
only
as
*NL*
a
friend
and
kinswoman
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
considered
that
he
might
so
mark
out
his
coming
years
as
to
begin
*NL*
his
ministry
at
the
age
of
thirty
--
an
age
which
much
attracted
him
as
*NL*
being
that
of
his
exemplar
when
he
first
began
to
teach
in
Galilee
.
*NL*
This
would
allow
him
plenty
of
time
for
deliberate
study
,
and
for
*NL*
acquiring
capital
by
his
trade
to
help
his
aftercourse
of
keeping
the
*NL*
necessary
terms
at
a
theological
college
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Christmas
had
come
and
passed
,
and
Sue
had
gone
to
the
Melchester
*NL*
Normal
School
.
The
time
was
just
the
worst
in
the
year
for
Jude
to
*NL*
get
into
new
employment
,
and
he
had
written
suggesting
to
her
that
*NL*
he
should
postpone
his
arrival
for
a
month
or
so
,
till
the
days
had
*NL*
lengthened
.
She
had
acquiesced
so
readily
that
he
wished
he
had
not
*NL*
proposed
it
--
she
evidently
did
not
much
care
about
him
,
though
she
*NL*
had
never
once
reproached
him
for
his
strange
conduct
in
coming
to
*NL*
her
that
night
,
and
his
silent
disappearance
.
Neither
had
she
ever
*NL*
said
a
word
about
her
relations
with
Mr.
Phillotson
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
,
however
,
quite
a
passionate
letter
arrived
from
Sue
.
*NL*
She
was
quite
lonely
and
miserable
,
she
told
him
.
She
hated
the
*NL*
place
she
was
in
;
it
was
worse
than
the
ecclesiastical
designer
's
;
*NL*
worse
than
anywhere
.
She
felt
utterly
friendless
;
could
he
come
*NL*
immediately
?
--
though
when
he
did
come
she
would
only
be
able
to
*NL*
see
him
at
limited
times
,
the
rules
of
the
establishment
she
found
*NL*
herself
in
being
strict
to
a
degree
.
It
was
Mr.
Phillotson
who
had
*NL*
advised
her
to
come
there
,
and
she
wished
she
had
never
listened
to
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Phillotson
's
suit
was
not
exactly
prospering
,
evidently
;
and
Jude
*NL*
felt
unreasonably
glad
.
He
packed
up
his
things
and
went
to
*NL*
Melchester
with
a
lighter
heart
than
he
had
known
for
months
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
being
the
turning
over
a
new
leaf
he
duly
looked
about
for
*NL*
a
temperance
hotel
,
and
found
a
little
establishment
of
that
*NL*
description
in
the
street
leading
from
the
station
.
When
he
had
*NL*
had
something
to
eat
he
walked
out
into
the
dull
winter
light
over
*NL*
the
town
bridge
,
and
turned
the
corner
towards
the
Close
.
The
*NL*
day
was
foggy
,
and
standing
under
the
walls
of
the
most
graceful
*NL*
architectural
pile
in
England
he
paused
and
looked
up
.
The
lofty
*NL*
building
was
visible
as
far
as
the
roofridge
;
above
,
the
dwindling
*NL*
spire
rose
more
and
more
remotely
,
till
its
apex
was
quite
lost
in
*NL*
the
mist
drifting
across
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lamps
now
began
to
be
lighted
,
and
turning
to
the
west
front
*NL*
he
walked
round
.
He
took
it
as
a
good
omen
that
numerous
blocks
*NL*
of
stone
were
lying
about
,
which
signified
that
the
cathedral
was
*NL*
undergoing
restoration
or
repair
to
a
considerable
extent
.
It
seemed
*NL*
to
him
,
full
of
the
superstitions
of
his
beliefs
,
that
this
was
an
*NL*
exercise
of
forethought
on
the
part
of
a
ruling
Power
,
that
he
might
*NL*
find
plenty
to
do
in
the
art
he
practised
while
waiting
for
a
call
to
*NL*
higher
labours
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
a
wave
of
warmth
came
over
him
as
he
thought
how
near
he
now
*NL*
stood
to
the
bright-eyed
vivacious
girl
with
the
broad
forehead
*NL*
and
pile
of
dark
hair
above
it
;
the
girl
with
the
kindling
glance
,
*NL*
daringly
soft
at
times
--
something
like
that
of
the
girls
he
had
*NL*
seen
in
engravings
from
paintings
of
the
Spanish
school
.
She
was
*NL*
here
--
actually
in
this
Close
--
in
one
of
the
houses
confronting
this
*NL*
very
west
facade
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
down
the
broad
gravel
path
towards
the
building
.
It
was
*NL*
an
ancient
edifice
of
the
fifteenth
century
,
once
a
palace
,
now
*NL*
a
training-school
,
with
mullioned
and
transomed
windows
,
and
a
*NL*
courtyard
in
front
shut
in
from
the
road
by
a
wall
.
Jude
opened
the
*NL*
gate
and
went
up
to
the
door
through
which
,
on
inquiring
for
his
*NL*
cousin
,
he
was
gingerly
admitted
to
a
waiting-room
,
and
in
a
few
*NL*
minutes
she
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
she
had
been
here
such
a
short
while
,
she
was
not
as
he
had
*NL*
seen
her
last
.
All
her
bounding
manner
was
gone
;
her
curves
of
*NL*
motion
had
become
subdued
lines
.
The
screens
and
subtleties
of
*NL*
convention
had
likewise
disappeared
.
Yet
neither
was
she
quite
the
*NL*
woman
who
had
written
the
letter
that
summoned
him
.
That
had
plainly
*NL*
been
dashed
off
in
an
impulse
which
second
thoughts
had
somewhat
*NL*
regretted
;
thoughts
that
were
possibly
of
his
recent
self-disgrace
.
*NL*
Jude
was
quite
overcome
with
emotion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
--
think
me
a
demoralized
wretch
--
for
coming
to
you
as
I
*NL*
was
--
and
going
so
shamefully
,
Sue
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
have
tried
not
to
!
You
said
enough
to
let
me
know
what
had
*NL*
caused
it
.
I
hope
I
shall
never
have
any
doubt
of
your
worthiness
,
*NL*
my
poor
Jude
!
And
I
am
glad
you
have
come
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
wore
a
murrey-coloured
gown
with
a
little
lace
collar
.
It
was
*NL*
made
quite
plain
,
and
hung
about
her
slight
figure
with
clinging
*NL*
gracefulness
.
Her
hair
,
which
formerly
she
had
worn
according
to
the
*NL*
custom
of
the
day
was
now
twisted
up
tightly
,
and
she
had
altogether
*NL*
the
air
of
a
woman
clipped
and
pruned
by
severe
discipline
,
*NL*
an
under-brightness
shining
through
from
the
depths
which
that
*NL*
discipline
had
not
yet
been
able
to
reach
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
come
forward
prettily
,
but
Jude
felt
that
she
had
hardly
*NL*
expected
him
to
kiss
her
,
as
he
was
burning
to
do
,
under
other
*NL*
colours
than
those
of
cousinship
.
He
could
not
perceive
the
least
*NL*
sign
that
Sue
regarded
him
as
a
lover
,
or
ever
would
do
so
,
now
that
*NL*
she
knew
the
worst
of
him
,
even
if
he
had
the
right
to
behave
as
one
;
*NL*
and
this
helped
on
his
growing
resolve
to
tell
her
of
his
matrimonial
*NL*
entanglement
,
which
he
had
put
off
doing
from
time
to
time
in
sheer
*NL*
dread
of
losing
the
bliss
of
her
company
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sue
came
out
into
the
town
with
him
,
and
they
walked
and
talked
with
*NL*
tongues
centred
only
on
the
passing
moments
.
Jude
said
he
would
like
*NL*
to
buy
her
a
little
present
of
some
sort
,
and
then
she
confessed
,
*NL*
with
something
of
shame
,
that
she
was
dreadfully
hungry
.
They
were
*NL*
kept
on
very
short
allowances
in
the
college
,
and
a
dinner
,
tea
,
and
*NL*
supper
all
in
one
was
the
present
she
most
desired
in
the
world
.
*NL*
Jude
thereupon
took
her
to
an
inn
and
ordered
whatever
the
house
*NL*
afforded
,
which
was
not
much
.
The
place
,
however
,
gave
them
a
*NL*
delightful
opportunity
for
a
_
tete-a-tete
_
,
nobody
else
being
in
the
*NL*
room
,
and
they
talked
freely
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
told
him
about
the
school
as
it
was
at
that
date
,
and
the
rough
*NL*
living
,
and
the
mixed
character
of
her
fellow-students
,
gathered
*NL*
together
from
all
parts
of
the
diocese
,
and
how
she
had
to
get
up
and
*NL*
work
by
gas-light
in
the
early
morning
,
with
all
the
bitterness
of
*NL*
a
young
person
to
whom
restraint
was
new
.
To
all
this
he
listened
;
*NL*
but
it
was
not
what
he
wanted
especially
to
know
--
her
relations
with
*NL*
Phillotson
.
That
was
what
she
did
not
tell
.
When
they
had
sat
and
*NL*
eaten
,
Jude
impulsively
placed
his
hand
upon
hers
;
she
looked
up
*NL*
and
smiled
,
and
took
his
quite
freely
into
her
own
little
soft
one
,
*NL*
dividing
his
fingers
and
coolly
examining
them
,
as
if
they
were
the
*NL*
fingers
of
a
glove
she
was
purchasing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
hands
are
rather
rough
,
Jude
,
are
n't
they
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
So
would
yours
be
if
they
held
a
mallet
and
chisel
all
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
dislike
it
,
you
know
.
I
think
it
is
noble
to
see
a
man
's
*NL*
hands
subdued
to
what
he
works
in
...
Well
,
I
'm
rather
glad
I
came
*NL*
to
this
training-school
,
after
all
.
See
how
independent
I
shall
be
*NL*
after
the
two
years
'
training
!
I
shall
pass
pretty
high
,
I
expect
,
*NL*
and
Mr.
Phillotson
will
use
his
influence
to
get
me
a
big
school
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
touched
the
subject
at
last
.
``
I
had
a
suspicion
,
a
fear
,
''
*NL*
said
Jude
,
``
that
he
--
cared
about
you
rather
warmly
,
and
perhaps
*NL*
wanted
to
marry
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
do
n't
be
such
a
silly
boy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
said
something
about
it
,
I
expect
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
he
had
,
what
would
it
matter
?
An
old
man
like
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
come
,
Sue
;
he
's
not
so
very
old
.
And
I
know
what
I
saw
him
*NL*
doing
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
kissing
me
--
that
I
'm
certain
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
But
putting
his
arm
round
your
waist
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
--
I
remember
.
But
I
did
n't
know
he
was
going
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
wriggling
out
if
it
,
Sue
,
and
it
is
n't
quite
kind
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
ever-sensitive
lip
began
to
quiver
,
and
her
eye
to
blink
,
at
*NL*
something
this
reproof
was
deciding
her
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
you
'll
be
angry
if
I
tell
you
everything
,
and
that
's
why
I
*NL*
do
n't
want
to
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
then
,
dear
,
''
he
said
soothingly
.
``
I
have
no
real
right
*NL*
to
ask
you
,
and
I
do
n't
wish
to
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
tell
you
!
''
said
she
,
with
the
perverseness
that
was
*NL*
part
of
her
.
``
This
is
what
I
have
done
:
I
have
promised
--
I
*NL*
have
promised
--
that
I
will
marry
him
when
I
come
out
of
the
*NL*
training-school
two
years
hence
,
and
have
got
my
certificate
;
his
*NL*
plan
being
that
we
shall
then
take
a
large
double
school
in
a
great
*NL*
town
--
he
the
boys
'
and
I
the
girls
'
--
as
married
school-teachers
often
*NL*
do
,
and
make
a
good
income
between
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Sue
!
...
But
of
course
it
is
right
--
you
could
n't
have
done
*NL*
better
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
glanced
at
her
and
their
eyes
met
,
the
reproach
in
his
own
belying
*NL*
his
words
.
Then
he
drew
his
hand
quite
away
from
hers
,
and
turned
*NL*
his
face
in
estrangement
from
her
to
the
window
.
Sue
regarded
him
*NL*
passively
without
moving
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
you
would
be
angry
!
''
she
said
with
an
air
of
no
emotion
*NL*
whatever
.
``
Very
well
--
I
am
wrong
,
I
suppose
!
I
ought
not
to
have
*NL*
let
you
come
to
see
me
!
We
had
better
not
meet
again
;
and
we
'll
only
*NL*
correspond
at
long
intervals
,
on
purely
business
matters
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
just
the
one
thing
he
would
not
be
able
to
bear
,
as
she
*NL*
probably
knew
,
and
it
brought
him
round
at
once
.
``
Oh
yes
,
we
will
,
''
*NL*
he
said
quickly
.
``
Your
being
engaged
can
make
no
difference
to
me
*NL*
whatever
.
I
have
a
perfect
right
to
see
you
when
I
want
to
;
and
I
*NL*
shall
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
do
n't
let
us
talk
of
it
any
more
.
It
is
quite
spoiling
our
*NL*
evening
together
.
What
does
it
matter
about
what
one
is
going
to
do
*NL*
two
years
hence
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
something
of
a
riddle
to
him
,
and
he
let
the
subject
drift
*NL*
away
.
``
Shall
we
go
and
sit
in
the
cathedral
?
''
he
asked
,
when
their
*NL*
meal
was
finished
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cathedral
?
Yes
.
Though
I
think
I
'd
rather
sit
in
the
railway
*NL*
station
,
''
she
answered
,
a
remnant
of
vexation
still
in
her
voice
.
*NL*
``
That
's
the
centre
of
the
town
life
now
.
The
cathedral
has
had
its
*NL*
day
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
modern
you
are
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
would
you
be
if
you
had
lived
so
much
in
the
Middle
Ages
as
I
*NL*
have
done
these
last
few
years
!
The
cathedral
was
a
very
good
place
*NL*
four
or
five
centuries
ago
;
but
it
is
played
out
now
...
I
am
not
*NL*
modern
,
either
.
I
am
more
ancient
than
mediaevalism
,
if
you
only
*NL*
knew
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
looked
distressed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
--
I
wo
n't
say
any
more
of
that
!
''
she
cried
.
``
Only
you
do
n't
*NL*
know
how
bad
I
am
,
from
your
point
of
view
,
or
you
would
n't
think
so
*NL*
much
of
me
,
or
care
whether
I
was
engaged
or
not
.
Now
there
's
just
*NL*
time
for
us
to
walk
round
the
Close
,
then
I
must
go
in
,
or
I
shall
be
*NL*
locked
out
for
the
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
her
to
the
gate
and
they
parted
.
Jude
had
a
conviction
that
*NL*
his
unhappy
visit
to
her
on
that
sad
night
had
precipitated
this
*NL*
marriage
engagement
,
and
it
did
anything
but
add
to
his
happiness
.
*NL*
Her
reproach
had
taken
that
shape
,
then
,
and
not
the
shape
of
words
.
*NL*
However
,
next
day
he
set
about
seeking
employment
,
which
it
was
not
*NL*
so
easy
to
get
as
at
Christminster
,
there
being
,
as
a
rule
,
less
*NL*
stone-cutting
in
progress
in
this
quiet
city
,
and
hands
being
mostly
*NL*
permanent
.
But
he
edged
himself
in
by
degrees
.
His
first
work
was
*NL*
some
carving
at
the
cemetery
on
the
hill
;
and
ultimately
he
became
*NL*
engaged
on
the
labour
he
most
desired
--
the
cathedral
repairs
,
which
*NL*
were
very
extensive
,
the
whole
interior
stonework
having
been
*NL*
overhauled
,
to
be
largely
replaced
by
new
.
It
might
be
a
labour
of
*NL*
years
to
get
it
all
done
,
and
he
had
confidence
enough
in
his
own
*NL*
skill
with
the
mallet
and
chisel
to
feel
that
it
would
be
a
matter
of
*NL*
choice
with
himself
how
long
he
would
stay
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lodgings
he
took
near
the
Close
Gate
would
not
have
disgraced
a
*NL*
curate
,
the
rent
representing
a
higher
percentage
on
his
wages
than
*NL*
mechanics
of
any
sort
usually
care
to
pay
.
His
combined
bed
and
*NL*
sitting-room
was
furnished
with
framed
photographs
of
the
rectories
*NL*
and
deaneries
at
which
his
landlady
had
lived
as
trusted
servant
in
*NL*
her
time
,
and
the
parlour
downstairs
bore
a
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
*NL*
inscribed
to
the
effect
that
it
was
presented
to
the
same
*NL*
serious-minded
woman
by
her
fellow-servants
on
the
occasion
of
her
*NL*
marriage
.
Jude
added
to
the
furniture
of
his
room
by
unpacking
*NL*
photographs
of
the
ecclesiastical
carvings
and
monuments
that
he
*NL*
had
executed
with
his
own
hands
;
and
he
was
deemed
a
satisfactory
*NL*
acquisition
as
tenant
of
the
vacant
apartment
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
found
an
ample
supply
of
theological
books
in
the
city
book-shops
,
*NL*
and
with
these
his
studies
were
recommenced
in
a
different
spirit
and
*NL*
direction
from
his
former
course
.
As
a
relaxation
from
the
Fathers
,
*NL*
and
such
stock
works
as
Paley
and
Butler
,
he
read
Newman
,
Pusey
,
and
*NL*
many
other
modern
lights
.
He
hired
a
harmonium
,
set
it
up
in
his
*NL*
lodging
,
and
practised
chants
thereon
,
single
and
double
.

``
To-morrow
is
our
grand
day

you
know

Where
shall
we
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
leave
from
three
till
nine

can
get

back

Not
ruins

do

care
for
them

*NL*
``
Well

Wardour
Castle

And
then

can
do
Fonthill
if

like

all

afternoon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wardour
is
Gothic
ruins

and
I
hate
Gothic
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

Quite
otherwise

It
is
a
classic
building

Corinthian

I

think
;
with
a
lot
of
pictures
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
--
that
will
do
.
I
like
the
sound
of
Corinthian

We
'll
go

''
*NL*
*NL*
Their
conversation
had
run
thus
some
few
weeks
later
,
and
next
*NL*
morning
they
prepared
to
start
.
Every
detail
of
the
outing
was
*NL*
a
facet
reflecting
a
sparkle
to
Jude
,
and
he
did
not
venture
to
*NL*
meditate
on
the
life
of
inconsistency
he
was
leading
.
His
Sue
's
*NL*
conduct
was
one
lovely
conundrum
to
him
;
he
could
say
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
duly
came
the
charm
of
calling
at
the
college
door
for
her
;
her
*NL*
emergence
in
a
nunlike
simplicity
of
costume
that
was
rather
enforced
*NL*
than
desired
;
the
traipsing
along
to
the
station
,
the
porters
'
*NL*
``
B'your
leave
!
,
''
the
screaming
of
the
trains
--
everything
formed
the
*NL*
basis
of
a
beautiful
crystallization
.
Nobody
stared
at
Sue
,
because
*NL*
she
was
so
plainly
dressed
,
which
comforted
Jude
in
the
thought
that
*NL*
only
himself
knew
the
charms
those
habiliments
subdued
.
A
matter
*NL*
of
ten
pounds
spent
in
a
drapery-shop
,
which
had
no
connection
*NL*
with
her
real
life
or
her
real
self
,
would
have
set
all
Melchester
*NL*
staring
.
The
guard
of
the
train
thought
they
were
lovers
,
and
put
*NL*
them
into
a
compartment
all
by
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
good
intention
wasted
!
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
did
not
respond
.
He
thought
the
remark
unnecessarily
cruel
,
*NL*
and
partly
untrue
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
reached
the
park
and
castle
and
wandered
through
the
*NL*
picture-galleries
,
Jude
stopping
by
preference
in
front
of
the
*NL*
devotional
pictures
by
Del
Sarto
,
Guido
Reni
,
Spagnoletto
,
*NL*
Sassoferrato
,
Carlo
Dolci
,
and
others
.
Sue
paused
patiently
beside
*NL*
him
,
and
stole
critical
looks
into
his
face
as
,
regarding
the
*NL*
Virgins
,
Holy
Families
,
and
Saints
,
it
grew
reverent
and
abstracted
.
*NL*
When
she
had
thoroughly
estimated
him
at
this
,
she
would
move
on
and
*NL*
wait
for
him
before
a
Lely
or
Reynolds
.
It
was
evident
that
her
*NL*
cousin
deeply
interested
her
,
as
one
might
be
interested
in
a
man
*NL*
puzzling
out
his
way
along
a
labyrinth
from
which
one
had
one
's
self
*NL*
escaped
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
came
out
a
long
time
still
remained
to
them
and
Jude
*NL*
proposed
that
as
soon
as
they
had
had
something
to
eat
they
should
*NL*
walk
across
the
high
country
to
the
north
of
their
present
position
,
*NL*
and
intercept
the
train
of
another
railway
leading
back
to
*NL*
Melchester
,
at
a
station
about
seven
miles
off
.
Sue
,
who
was
*NL*
inclined
for
any
adventure
that
would
intensify
the
sense
of
her
*NL*
day
's
freedom
,
readily
agreed
;
and
away
they
went
,
leaving
the
*NL*
adjoining
station
behind
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
indeed
open
country
,
wide
and
high
.
They
talked
and
bounded
*NL*
on
,
Jude
cutting
from
a
little
covert
a
long
walking-stick
for
Sue
*NL*
as
tall
as
herself
,
with
a
great
crook
,
which
made
her
look
like
a
*NL*
shepherdess
.
About
half-way
on
their
journey
they
crossed
a
main
*NL*
road
running
due
east
and
west
--
the
old
road
from
London
to
Land
's
*NL*
End
.
They
paused
,
and
looked
up
and
down
it
for
a
moment
,
and
*NL*
remarked
upon
the
desolation
which
had
come
over
this
once
lively
*NL*
thoroughfare
,
while
the
wind
dipped
to
earth
and
scooped
straws
and
*NL*
hay-stems
from
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
crossed
the
road
and
passed
on
,
but
during
the
next
half-mile
*NL*
Sue
seemed
to
grow
tired
,
and
Jude
began
to
be
distressed
for
her
.
*NL*
They
had
walked
a
good
distance
altogether
,
and
if
they
could
not
*NL*
reach
the
other
station
it
would
be
rather
awkward
.
For
a
long
*NL*
time
there
was
no
cottage
visible
on
the
wide
expanse
of
down
and
*NL*
turnip-land
;
but
presently
they
came
to
a
sheepfold
,
and
next
to
the
*NL*
shepherd
,
pitching
hurdles
.
He
told
them
that
the
only
house
near
*NL*
was
his
mother
's
and
his
,
pointing
to
a
little
dip
ahead
from
which
a
*NL*
faint
blue
smoke
arose
,
and
recommended
them
to
go
on
and
rest
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
they
did
,
and
entered
the
house
,
admitted
by
an
old
woman
*NL*
without
a
single
tooth
,
to
whom
they
were
as
civil
as
strangers
can
*NL*
be
when
their
only
chance
of
rest
and
shelter
lies
in
the
favour
of
*NL*
the
householder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
nice
little
cottage
,
''
said
Jude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
know
about
the
niceness
.
I
shall
have
to
thatch
it
*NL*
soon
,
and
where
the
thatch
is
to
come
from
I
ca
n't
tell
,
for
straw
do
*NL*
get
that
dear
,
that
`
twill
soon
be
cheaper
to
cover
your
house
wi
'
*NL*
chainey
plates
than
thatch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
sat
resting
,
and
the
shepherd
came
in
.
``
Do
n't
`
ee
mind
I
,
''
he
*NL*
said
with
a
deprecating
wave
of
the
hand
;
``
bide
here
as
long
as
ye
*NL*
will
.
But
mid
you
be
thinking
o
'
getting
back
to
Melchester
to-night
*NL*
by
train
?
Because
you
'll
never
do
it
in
this
world
,
since
you
do
n't
*NL*
know
the
lie
of
the
country
.
I
do
n't
mind
going
with
ye
some
o
'
the
*NL*
ways
,
but
even
then
the
train
mid
be
gone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
started
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
bide
here
,
you
know
,
over
the
night
--
ca
n't
'em
,
Mother
?
*NL*
The
place
is
welcome
to
ye
.
'T
is
hard
lying
,
rather
,
but
volk
may
do
*NL*
worse
.
''
He
turned
to
Jude
and
asked
privately
:
``
Be
you
a
married
*NL*
couple
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hsh
--
no
!
''
said
Jude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
I
meant
nothing
ba
`
dy
--
not
I
!
Well
then
,
she
can
go
into
*NL*
Mother
's
room
,
and
you
and
I
can
lie
in
the
outer
chimmer
after
*NL*
they
've
gone
through
.
I
can
call
ye
soon
enough
to
catch
the
first
*NL*
train
back
.
You
've
lost
this
one
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
consideration
they
decided
to
close
with
this
offer
,
and
drew
up
*NL*
and
shared
with
the
shepherd
and
his
mother
the
boiled
bacon
and
*NL*
greens
for
supper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
rather
like
this
,
''
said
Sue
,
while
their
entertainers
were
*NL*
clearing
away
the
dishes
.
``
Outside
all
laws
except
gravitation
and
*NL*
germination
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
only
think
you
like
it
;
you
do
n't
:
you
are
quite
a
product
of
*NL*
civilization
,
''
said
Jude
,
a
recollection
of
her
engagement
reviving
*NL*
his
soreness
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
I
am
not
,
Jude
.
I
like
reading
and
all
that
,
but
I
crave
to
*NL*
get
back
to
the
life
of
my
infancy
and
its
freedom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
remember
it
so
well
?
You
seem
to
me
to
have
nothing
*NL*
unconventional
at
all
about
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
have
n't
I
!
You
do
n't
know
what
's
inside
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Ishmaelite
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
urban
miss
is
what
you
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
severe
disagreement
,
and
turned
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
shepherd
aroused
them
the
next
morning
,
as
he
had
said
.
It
was
*NL*
bright
and
clear
,
and
the
four
miles
to
the
train
were
accomplished
*NL*
pleasantly
.
When
they
had
reached
Melchester
,
and
walked
to
the
*NL*
Close
,
and
the
gables
of
the
old
building
in
which
she
was
again
to
*NL*
be
immured
rose
before
Sue
's
eyes
,
she
looked
a
little
scared
.
``
I
*NL*
expect
I
shall
catch
it
!
''
she
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
rang
the
great
bell
and
waited
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
bought
something
for
you
,
which
I
had
nearly
forgotten
,
''
she
*NL*
said
quickly
,
searching
her
pocket
.
``
It
is
a
new
little
photograph
*NL*
of
me
.
Would
you
like
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
WOULD
I
!
''
He
took
it
gladly
,
and
the
porter
came
.
There
seemed
to
*NL*
be
an
ominous
glance
on
his
face
when
he
opened
the
gate
.
She
passed
*NL*
in
,
looking
back
at
Jude
,
and
waving
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
seventy
young
women
,
of
ages
varying
in
the
main
from
nineteen
to
*NL*
one-and-twenty
,
though
several
were
older
,
who
at
this
date
filled
*NL*
the
species
of
nunnery
known
as
the
Training-School
at
Melchester
,
*NL*
formed
a
very
mixed
community
,
which
included
the
daughters
of
*NL*
mechanics
,
curates
,
surgeons
,
shopkeepers
,
farmers
,
dairy-men
,
*NL*
soldiers
,
sailors
,
and
villagers
.
They
sat
in
the
large
school-room
*NL*
of
the
establishment
on
the
evening
previously
described
,
and
word
*NL*
was
passed
round
that
Sue
Bridehead
had
not
come
in
at
closing-time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
went
out
with
her
young
man
,
''
said
a
second-year
's
student
,
who
*NL*
knew
about
young
men
.
``
And
Miss
Traceley
saw
her
at
the
station
with
*NL*
him
.
She
'll
have
it
hot
when
she
does
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
said
he
was
her
cousin
,
''
observed
a
youthful
new
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
excuse
has
been
made
a
little
too
often
in
this
school
to
be
*NL*
effectual
in
saving
our
souls
,
''
said
the
head
girl
of
the
year
,
*NL*
drily
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fact
was
that
,
only
twelve
months
before
,
there
had
occurred
*NL*
a
lamentable
seduction
of
one
of
the
pupils
who
had
made
the
same
*NL*
statement
in
order
to
gain
meetings
with
her
lover
.
The
affair
had
*NL*
created
a
scandal
,
and
the
management
had
consequently
been
rough
on
*NL*
cousins
ever
since
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
nine
o'clock
the
names
were
called
,
Sue
's
being
pronounced
three
*NL*
times
sonorously
by
Miss
Traceley
without
eliciting
an
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
a
quarter
past
nine
the
seventy
stood
up
to
sing
the
``
Evening
*NL*
Hymn
,
''
and
then
knelt
down
to
prayers
.
After
prayers
they
went
in
to
*NL*
supper
,
and
every
girl
's
thought
was
,
Where
is
Sue
Bridehead
?
Some
*NL*
of
the
students
,
who
had
seen
Jude
from
the
window
,
felt
that
they
*NL*
would
not
mind
risking
her
punishment
for
the
pleasure
of
being
*NL*
kissed
by
such
a
kindly-faced
young
man
.
Hardly
one
among
them
*NL*
believed
in
the
cousinship
.
*NL*
*NL*
Half
an
hour
later
they
all
lay
in
their
cubicles
,
their
tender
*NL*
feminine
faces
upturned
to
the
flaring
gas-jets
which
at
intervals
*NL*
stretched
down
the
long
dormitories
,
every
face
bearing
the
legend
*NL*
``
The
Weaker
''
upon
it
,
as
the
penalty
of
the
sex
wherein
they
were
*NL*
moulded
,
which
by
no
possible
exertion
of
their
willing
hearts
and
*NL*
abilities
could
be
made
strong
while
the
inexorable
laws
of
nature
*NL*
remain
what
they
are
.
They
formed
a
pretty
,
suggestive
,
pathetic
*NL*
sight
,
of
whose
pathos
and
beauty
they
were
themselves
unconscious
,
*NL*
and
would
not
discover
till
,
amid
the
storms
and
strains
of
*NL*
after-years
,
with
their
injustice
,
loneliness
,
child-bearing
,
and
*NL*
bereavement
,
their
minds
would
revert
to
this
experience
as
to
*NL*
something
which
had
been
allowed
to
slip
past
them
insufficiently
*NL*
regarded
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
mistresses
came
in
to
turn
out
the
lights
,
and
before
*NL*
doing
so
gave
a
final
glance
at
Sue
's
cot
,
which
remained
empty
,
and
*NL*
at
her
little
dressing-table
at
the
foot
,
which
,
like
all
the
rest
,
*NL*
was
ornamented
with
various
girlish
trifles
,
framed
photographs
being
*NL*
not
the
least
conspicuous
among
them
.
Sue
's
table
had
a
moderate
*NL*
show
,
two
men
in
their
filigree
and
velvet
frames
standing
together
*NL*
beside
her
looking-glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
are
these
men
--
did
she
ever
say
?
''
asked
the
mistress
.
``
Strictly
*NL*
speaking
,
relations
'
portraits
only
are
allowed
on
these
tables
,
you
*NL*
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
--
the
middle-aged
man
,
''
said
a
student
in
the
next
bed
--
``
is
the
*NL*
schoolmaster
she
served
under
--
Mr.
Phillotson
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
other
--
this
undergraduate
in
cap
and
gown
--
who
is
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
a
friend
,
or
was
.
She
has
never
told
his
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
it
either
of
these
two
who
came
for
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
sure
't
was
not
the
undergraduate
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
.
He
was
a
young
man
with
a
black
beard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
lights
were
promptly
extinguished
,
and
till
they
fell
asleep
the
*NL*
girls
indulged
in
conjectures
about
Sue
,
and
wondered
what
games
*NL*
she
had
carried
on
in
London
and
at
Christminster
before
she
came
*NL*
here
,
some
of
the
more
restless
ones
getting
out
of
bed
and
looking
*NL*
from
the
mullioned
windows
at
the
vast
west
front
of
the
cathedral
*NL*
opposite
,
and
the
spire
rising
behind
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
awoke
the
next
morning
they
glanced
into
Sue
's
nook
,
*NL*
to
find
it
still
without
a
tenant
.
After
the
early
lessons
by
*NL*
gas-light
,
in
half-toilet
,
and
when
they
had
come
up
to
dress
for
*NL*
breakfast
,
the
bell
of
the
entrance
gate
was
heard
to
ring
loudly
.
*NL*
The
mistress
of
the
dormitory
went
away
,
and
presently
came
back
to
*NL*
say
that
the
principal
's
orders
were
that
nobody
was
to
speak
to
*NL*
Bridehead
without
permission
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
,
accordingly
,
Sue
came
into
the
dormitory
to
hastily
tidy
*NL*
herself
,
looking
flushed
and
tired
,
she
went
to
her
cubicle
in
*NL*
silence
,
none
of
them
coming
out
to
greet
her
or
to
make
inquiry
.
*NL*
When
they
had
gone
downstairs
they
found
that
she
did
not
follow
them
*NL*
into
the
dining-hall
to
breakfast
,
and
they
then
learnt
that
she
had
*NL*
been
severely
reprimanded
,
and
ordered
to
a
solitary
room
for
a
week
,
*NL*
there
to
be
confined
,
and
take
her
meals
,
and
do
all
her
reading
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
the
seventy
murmured
,
the
sentence
being
,
they
thought
,
too
*NL*
severe
.
A
round
robin
was
prepared
and
sent
in
to
the
principal
,
*NL*
asking
for
a
remission
of
Sue
's
punishment
.
No
notice
was
taken
.
*NL*
Towards
evening
,
when
the
geography
mistress
began
dictating
her
*NL*
subject
,
the
girls
in
the
class
sat
with
folded
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
that
you
are
not
going
to
work
?
''
said
the
mistress
at
last
.
*NL*
``
I
may
as
well
tell
you
that
it
has
been
ascertained
that
the
young
*NL*
man
Bridehead
stayed
out
with
was
not
her
cousin
,
for
the
very
*NL*
good
reason
that
she
has
no
such
relative
.
We
have
written
to
*NL*
Christminster
to
ascertain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
willing
to
take
her
word

said
the
head
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

young
man
was
discharged
from
his
work
at
Christminster
for
*NL*
drunkenness
and
blasphemy
in
public-houses
,
and
he
has
come
here
to
*NL*
live
,
entirely
to
be
near
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
they
remained
stolid
and
motionless
,
and
the
mistress
left
*NL*
the
room
to
inquire
from
her
superiors
what
was
to
be
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
,
towards
dusk
,
the
pupils
,
as
they
sat
,
heard
exclamations
*NL*
from
the
first-year
's
girls
in
an
adjoining
classroom
,
and
one
rushed
*NL*
in
to
say
that
Sue
Bridehead
had
got
out
of
the
back
window
of
the
*NL*
room
in
which
she
had
been
confined
,
escaped
in
the
dark
across
the
*NL*
lawn
,
and
disappeared
.
How
she
had
managed
to
get
out
of
the
garden
*NL*
nobody
could
tell
,
as
it
was
bounded
by
the
river
at
the
bottom
,
and
*NL*
the
side
door
was
locked
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
and
looked
at
the
empty
room
,
the
casement
between
the
*NL*
middle
mullions
of
which
stood
open
.
The
lawn
was
again
searched
*NL*
with
a
lantern
,
every
bush
and
shrub
being
examined
,
but
she
was
*NL*
nowhere
hidden
.
Then
the
porter
of
the
front
gate
was
interrogated
,
*NL*
and
on
reflection
he
said
that
he
remembered
hearing
a
sort
of
*NL*
splashing
in
the
stream
at
the
back
,
but
he
had
taken
no
notice
,
*NL*
thinking
some
ducks
had
come
down
the
river
from
above
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
must
have
walked
through
the
river
!
''
said
a
mistress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
drownded
herself
,
''
said
the
porter
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mind
of
the
matron
was
horrified
--
not
so
much
at
the
possible
*NL*
death
of
Sue
as
at
the
possible
half-column
detailing
that
event
in
*NL*
all
the
newspapers
,
which
,
added
to
the
scandal
of
the
year
before
,
*NL*
would
give
the
college
an
unenviable
notoriety
for
many
months
to
*NL*
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
More
lanterns
were
procured
,
and
the
river
examined
;
and
then
,
at
*NL*
last
,
on
the
opposite
shore
,
which
was
open
to
the
fields
,
some
*NL*
little
boot-tracks
were
discerned
in
the
mud
,
which
left
no
doubt
*NL*
that
the
too
excitable
girl
had
waded
through
a
depth
of
water
*NL*
reaching
nearly
to
her
shoulders
--
for
this
was
the
chief
river
of
the
*NL*
county
,
and
was
mentioned
in
all
the
geography
books
with
respect
.
*NL*
As
Sue
had
not
brought
disgrace
upon
the
school
by
drowning
herself
,
*NL*
the
matron
began
to
speak
superciliously
of
her
,
and
to
express
*NL*
gladness
that
she
was
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
self-same
evening
Jude
sat
in
his
lodgings
by
the
Close
Gate
.
*NL*
Often
at
this
hour
after
dusk
he
would
enter
the
silent
Close
,
and
*NL*
stand
opposite
the
house
that
contained
Sue
,
and
watch
the
shadows
of
*NL*
the
girls
'
heads
passing
to
and
fro
upon
the
blinds
,
and
wish
he
had
*NL*
nothing
else
to
do
but
to
sit
reading
and
learning
all
day
what
many
*NL*
of
the
thoughtless
inmates
despised
.
But
to-night
,
having
finished
*NL*
tea
and
brushed
himself
up
,
he
was
deep
in
the
perusal
of
the
*NL*
Twenty-ninth
Volume
of
Pusey
's
Library
of
the
Fathers
,
a
set
of
books
*NL*
which
he
had
purchased
of
a
second-hand
dealer
at
a
price
that
seemed
*NL*
to
him
to
be
one
of
miraculous
cheapness
for
that
invaluable
work
.
He
*NL*
fancied
he
heard
something
rattle
lightly
against
his
window
;
then
he
*NL*
heard
it
again
.
Certainly
somebody
had
thrown
gravel
.
He
rose
and
*NL*
gently
lifted
the
sash
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jude
!
''
-LRB-
from
below
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sue
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
it
is
!
Can
I
come
up
without
being
seen
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
do
n't
come
down
.
Shut
the
window
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
waited
,
knowing
that
she
could
enter
easily
enough
,
the
front
*NL*
door
being
opened
merely
by
a
knob
which
anybody
could
turn
,
as
*NL*
in
most
old
country
towns
.
He
palpitated
at
the
thought
that
she
*NL*
had
fled
to
him
in
her
trouble
as
he
had
fled
to
her
in
his
.
What
*NL*
counterparts
they
were
!
He
unlatched
the
door
of
his
room
,
heard
a
*NL*
stealthy
rustle
on
the
dark
stairs
,
and
in
a
moment
she
appeared
in
*NL*
the
light
of
his
lamp
.
He
went
up
to
seize
her
hand
,
and
found
she
*NL*
was
clammy
as
a
marine
deity
,
and
that
her
clothes
clung
to
her
like
*NL*
the
robes
upon
the
figures
in
the
Parthenon
frieze
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
so
cold
!
''
she
said
through
her
chattering
teeth
.
``
Can
I
come
by
*NL*
your
fire
,
Jude
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
crossed
to
his
little
grate
and
very
little
fire
,
but
as
the
*NL*
water
dripped
from
her
as
she
moved
,
the
idea
of
drying
herself
was
*NL*
absurd
.
``
Whatever
have
you
done
,
darling
?
''
he
asked
,
with
alarm
,
the
*NL*
tender
epithet
slipping
out
unawares
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Walked
through
the
largest
river
in
the
county
--
that
's
what
I
've
*NL*
done
!
They
locked
me
up
for
being
out
with
you
;
and
it
seemed
so
*NL*
unjust
that
I
could
n't
bear
it
,
so
I
got
out
of
the
window
and
*NL*
escaped
across
the
stream
!
''
She
had
begun
the
explanation
in
her
*NL*
usual
slightly
independent
tones
,
but
before
she
had
finished
the
*NL*
thin
pink
lips
trembled
,
and
she
could
hardly
refrain
from
crying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
Sue
!
''
he
said
.
``
You
must
take
off
all
your
things
!
And
let
me
*NL*
see
--
you
must
borrow
some
from
the
landlady
.
I
'll
ask
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
!
Do
n't
let
her
know
,
for
God
's
sake
!
We
are
so
near
the
*NL*
school
that
they
'll
come
after
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
must
put
on
mine
.
You
do
n't
mind
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
Sunday
suit
,
you
know
.
It
is
close
here
.
''
In
fact
,
everything
*NL*
was
close
and
handy
in
Jude
's
single
chamber
,
because
there
was
not
*NL*
room
for
it
to
be
otherwise
.
He
opened
a
drawer
,
took
out
his
best
*NL*
dark
suit
,
and
giving
the
garments
a
shake
,
said
,
``
Now
,
how
long
*NL*
shall
I
give
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ten
minutes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
left
the
room
and
went
into
the
street
,
where
he
walked
up
and
*NL*
down
.
A
clock
struck
half-past
seven
,
and
he
returned
.
Sitting
in
*NL*
his
only
arm-chair
he
saw
a
slim
and
fragile
being
masquerading
as
*NL*
himself
on
a
Sunday
,
so
pathetic
in
her
defencelessness
that
his
*NL*
heart
felt
big
with
the
sense
of
it
.
On
two
other
chairs
before
the
*NL*
fire
were
her
wet
garments
.
She
blushed
as
he
sat
down
beside
her
,
*NL*
but
only
for
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
,
Jude
,
it
is
odd
that
you
should
see
me
like
this
and
all
*NL*
my
things
hanging
there
?
Yet
what
nonsense
!
They
are
only
a
woman
's
*NL*
clothes
--
sexless
cloth
and
linen
...
I
wish
I
did
n't
feel
so
ill
and
*NL*
sick
!
Will
you
dry
my
clothes
now
?
Please
do
,
Jude
,
and
I
'll
get
a
*NL*
lodging
by
and
by
.
It
is
not
late
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
you
sha
n't
,
if
you
are
ill
.
You
must
stay
here
.
Dear
,
dear
*NL*
Sue
,
what
can
I
get
for
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
!
I
ca
n't
help
shivering
.
I
wish
I
could
get
warm
.
''
*NL*
Jude
put
on
her
his
great-coat
in
addition
,
and
then
ran
out
to
the
*NL*
nearest
public-house
,
whence
he
returned
with
a
little
bottle
in
his
*NL*
hand
.
``
Here
's
six
of
best
brandy
,
''
he
said
.
``
Now
you
drink
it
,
*NL*
dear
;
all
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
out
of
the
bottle
,
can
I
?
''
Jude
fetched
the
glass
from
the
*NL*
dressing-table
,
and
administered
the
spirit
in
some
water
.
She
*NL*
gasped
a
little
,
but
gulped
it
down
,
and
lay
back
in
the
armchair
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
then
began
to
relate
circumstantially
her
experiences
since
*NL*
they
had
parted
;
but
in
the
middle
of
her
story
her
voice
faltered
,
*NL*
her
head
nodded
,
and
she
ceased
.
She
was
in
a
sound
sleep
.
Jude
,
*NL*
dying
of
anxiety
lest
she
should
have
caught
a
chill
which
might
*NL*
permanently
injure
her
,
was
glad
to
hear
the
regular
breathing
.
He
*NL*
softly
went
nearer
to
her
,
and
observed
that
a
warm
flush
now
rosed
*NL*
her
hitherto
blue
cheeks
,
and
felt
that
her
hanging
hand
was
no
*NL*
longer
cold
.
Then
he
stood
with
his
back
to
the
fire
regarding
her
,
*NL*
and
saw
in
her
almost
a
divinity
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*

IV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
's
reverie
was
interrupted
by
the
creak
of
footsteps
ascending
*NL*
the
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
whisked
Sue
's
clothing
from
the
chair
where
it
was
drying
,
thrust
*NL*
it
under
the
bed
,
and
sat
down
to
his
book
.
Somebody
knocked
and
*NL*
opened
the
door
immediately
.
It
was
the
landlady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
did
n't
know
whether
you
was
in
or
not
,
Mr.
Fawley
.
I
*NL*
wanted
to
know
if
you
would
require
supper
.
I
see
you
've
a
young
*NL*
gentleman
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
ma'am
.
But
I
think
I
wo
n't
come
down
to-night
.
Will
you
bring
*NL*
supper
up
on
a
tray
,
and
I
'll
have
a
cup
of
tea
as
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Jude
's
custom
to
go
downstairs
to
the
kitchen
,
and
eat
his
*NL*
meals
with
the
family
,
to
save
trouble
.
His
landlady
brought
up
the
*NL*
supper
,
however
,
on
this
occasion
,
and
he
took
it
from
her
at
the
*NL*
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
had
descended
he
set
the
teapot
on
the
hob
,
and
drew
out
*NL*
Sue
's
clothes
anew
;
but
they
were
far
from
dry
.
A
thick
woollen
*NL*
gown
,
he
found
,
held
a
deal
of
water
.
So
he
hung
them
up
again
,
and
*NL*
enlarged
his
fire
and
mused
as
the
steam
from
the
garments
went
up
*NL*
the
chimney
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
she
said
,
``
Jude
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
All
right
.
How
do
you
feel
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Better
.
Quite
well
.
Why
,
I
fell
asleep
,
did
n't
I
?
What
time
is
*NL*
it
?
Not
late
surely
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
past
ten
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
really
?
What
SHALL
I
do
!
''
she
said
,
starting
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
where
you
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
that
's
what
I
want
to
do
.
But
I
do
n't
know
what
they
would
*NL*
say
!
And
what
will
you
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
to
sit
here
by
the
fire
all
night
,
and
read
.
To-morrow
*NL*
is
Sunday
,
and
I
have
n't
to
go
out
anywhere
.
Perhaps
you
will
be
*NL*
saved
a
severe
illness
by
resting
there
.
Do
n't
be
frightened
.
I
'm
*NL*
all
right
.
Look
here
,
what
I
have
got
for
you
.
Some
supper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
had
sat
upright
she
breathed
plaintively
and
said
,
``
I
do
*NL*
feel
rather
weak
still
.
I
thought
I
was
well
;
and
I
ought
not
to
be
*NL*
here
,
ought
I
?
''
But
the
supper
fortified
her
somewhat
,
and
when
she
*NL*
had
had
some
tea
and
had
lain
back
again
she
was
bright
and
cheerful
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tea
must
have
been
green
,
or
too
long
drawn
,
for
she
seemed
*NL*
preternaturally
wakeful
afterwards
,
though
Jude
,
who
had
not
taken
*NL*
any
,
began
to
feel
heavy
;
till
her
conversation
fixed
his
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
called
me
a
creature
of
civilization
,
or
something
,
did
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
she
said
,
breaking
a
silence
.
``
It
was
very
odd
you
should
have
done
*NL*
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
because
it
is
provokingly
wrong
.
I
am
a
sort
of
negation
of
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very
philosophical
.
'
A
negation

is
profound
talking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
?
Do
I
strike
you
as
being
learned
?
''
she
asked
,
with
a
touch
*NL*
of
raillery
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
not
learned
.
Only
you
do

talk
quite
like
a
girl

well

a
*NL*
girl
who
has
had
no
advantages

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
had
advantages

I
do
n't
know
Latin

Greek

though
I
know

the

those
tongues
.
But
I
know
most
of
the
Greek
and
*NL*
Latin
classics
through
translations
,
and
other
books
too

I
read

Lempriere

Smollett

Shakespeare

the

other
such
;

found
that
all
interest

in
the
unwholesome
part

those
books
ended
with
its
mystery

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
read
more
than
I

he
said
with
a
sigh
.
``
How
came

read
some
of
those
queerer
ones

*NL*
``
Well
,
''
she
said
thoughtfully
,
``
it
was
by
accident
.
My
life
has
been
*NL*
entirely
shaped
by
what
people
call
a
peculiarity
in
me
.
I
have
no
*NL*
fear
of
men
,
as
such
,
nor
of
their
books
.
I
have
mixed
with
them
--
one
*NL*
or
two
of
them
particularly
--
almost
as
one
of
their
own
sex
.
I
mean
*NL*
I
have
not
felt
about
them
as
most
women
are
taught
to
feel
--
to
be
on
*NL*
their
guard
against
attacks
on
their
virtue
;
for
no
average
man
--
no
*NL*
man
short
of
a
sensual
savage
--
will
molest
a
woman
by
day
or
night
,
*NL*
at
home
or
abroad
,
unless
she
invites
him
.
Until
she
says
by
a
look
*NL*
`
Come
on
'
he
is
always
afraid
to
,
and
if
you
never
say
it
,
or
look
*NL*
it
,
he
never
comes
.
However
,
what
I
was
going
to
say
is
that
when
I
*NL*
was
eighteen
I
formed
a
friendly
intimacy
with
an
undergraduate
at
*NL*
Christminster
,
and
he
taught
me
a
great
deal
,
and
lent
me
books
which
*NL*
I
should
never
have
got
hold
of
otherwise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
your
friendship
broken
off
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
.
He
died
,
poor
fellow
,
two
or
three
years
after
he
had
taken
*NL*
his
degree
and
left
Christminster
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
saw
a
good
deal
of
him
,
I
suppose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
We
used
to
go
about
together
--
on
walking
tours
,
reading
tours
,
*NL*
and
things
of
that
sort
--
like
two
men
almost
.
He
asked
me
to
live
*NL*
with
him
,
and
I
agreed
to
by
letter
.
But
when
I
joined
him
in
London
*NL*
I
found
he
meant
a
different
thing
from
what
I
meant
.
He
wanted
me
*NL*
to
be
his
mistress
,
in
fact
,
but
I
was
n't
in
love
with
him
--
and
on
*NL*
my
saying
I
should
go
away
if
he
did
n't
agree
to
MY
plan
,
he
did
*NL*
so
.
We
shared
a
sitting-room
for
fifteen
months
;
and
he
became
a
*NL*
leader-writer
for
one
of
the
great
London
dailies
;
till
he
was
taken
*NL*
ill
,
and
had
to
go
abroad
.
He
said
I
was
breaking
his
heart
by
*NL*
holding
out
against
him
so
long
at
such
close
quarters
;
he
could
*NL*
never
have
believed
it
of
woman
.
I
might
play
that
game
once
too
*NL*
often
,
he
said
.
He
came
home
merely
to
die
.
His
death
caused
a
*NL*
terrible
remorse
in
me
for
my
cruelty
--
though
I
hope
he
died
of
*NL*
consumption
and
not
of
me
entirely
.
I
went
down
to
Sandbourne
*NL*
to
his
funeral
,
and
was
his
only
mourner
.
He
left
me
a
little
*NL*
money
--
because
I
broke
his
heart
,
I
suppose
.
That
's
how
men
*NL*
are
--
so
much
better
than
women
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
heavens
!
--
what
did
you
do
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
--
now
you
are
angry
with
me
!
''
she
said
,
a
contralto
note
of
*NL*
tragedy
coming
suddenly
into
her
silvery
voice
.
``
I
would
n't
have
*NL*
told
you
if
I
had
known
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
am
not
.
Tell
me
all

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
invested
his
money
,
poor
fellow
,
in
a
bubble
scheme
,
and
*NL*
lost
it
.
I
lived
about
London
by
myself
for
some
time
,
and
then
I
*NL*
returned
to
Christminster
,
as
my
father
--
who
was
also
in
London
,
and
*NL*
had
started
as
an
art
metal-worker
near
Long-Acre
--
would
n't
have
me
*NL*
back
;
and
I
got
that
occupation
in
the
artist-shop
where
you
found

me

bad

Jude
looked
round
upon
the
arm-chair
and
its
occupant
,
as
if
to
read
*NL*
more
carefully
the
creature
he
had
given
shelter
to
.
His
voice
*NL*
trembled
as
he
said
:
``
However
you
have
lived

Sue

I
believe

are
*NL*

innocent

*NL*
said
she
,
with
an
ostensible
sneer

though
he
could
hear
that
she
was
*NL*
brimming
with
tears
.
``

Jude
felt
much
depressed
;
she
seemed
to
get
further
and
further
away
*NL*
from
him
with
her
strange
ways
and
curious
unconsciousness
of

*NL*
*NL*
``

REALLY
vexed

she
suddenly
asked
,
in

a
voice
of
such
extraordinary
tenderness
that
it
hardly
seemed
to
*NL*
come
from
the

woman
who
had
just
told
her
story
so
lightly

There
was
another
long
silence
.
He
felt
that
she
was
treating
*NL*
him
cruelly
,
though
he
could
not
quite
say
in
what
way

Her
very
*NL*
helplessness
seemed
to
make
her
so
much
stronger
than
he

*NL*
``

turn
the
subject

earnestly

out

ever

the
most
moral

intellect
at

Christminster
must

off

itself

have
to
go

at
times

could

having
a
sneaking
liking
for

the
traditions

the
old
faith
,
as
preserved
by
a
section
of
the
*NL*
thinkers
there
in
touching
and
simple
sincerity

when
I
was
in
my

saddest

The
emotional
throat-note
had
come
back

she
turned
her
face
away

turned
the

,
sitting
with
long
faces
and
*NL*
writing
down
such
stuff
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
looked
pained
.
``
You
are
quite
Voltairean
!
''
he
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
?
Then
I
wo
n't
say
any
more
,
except
that
people
have
no
*NL*
right
to
falsify
the
Bible
!
I
HATE
such
hum-bug
as
could
attempt
to
*NL*
plaster
over
with
ecclesiastical
abstractions
such
ecstatic
,
natural
,
*NL*
human
love
as
lies
in
that
great
and
passionate
song
!
''
Her
speech
*NL*
had
grown
spirited
,
and
almost
petulant
at
his
rebuke
,
and
her
eyes
*NL*
moist
.
``
I
WISH
I
had
a
friend
here
to
support
me
;
but
nobody
is
ever
*NL*
on
my
side
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
my
dear
Sue
,
my
very
dear
Sue
,
I
am
not
against
you
!
''
he
said
,
*NL*
taking
her
hand
,
and
surprised
at
her
introducing
personal
feeling
*NL*
into
mere
argument
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
you
are
,
yes
you
are
!
''
she
cried
,
turning
away
her
face
that
he
*NL*
might
not
see
her
brimming
eyes
.
``
You
are
on
the
side
of
the
people
*NL*
in
the
training-school
--
at
least
you
seem
almost
to
be
!
What
I
*NL*
insist
on
is
,
that
to
explain
such
verses
as
this
:
`
Whither
is
thy
*NL*
beloved
gone
,
O
thou
fairest
among
women
?
'
by
the
note
:
'
_
The
Church
*NL*
professeth
her
faith
_
,
'
is
supremely
ridiculous
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
let
it
be
!
You
make
such
a
personal
matter
of
*NL*
everything
!
I
am
--
only
too
inclined
just
now
to
apply
the
words
*NL*
profanely
.
You
know
YOU
are
fairest
among
women
to
me
,
come
to
*NL*
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
are
not
to
say
it
now
!
''
Sue
replied
,
her
voice
changing
*NL*
to
its
softest
note
of
severity
.
Then
their
eyes
met
,
and
they
*NL*
shook
hands
like
cronies
in
a
tavern
,
and
Jude
saw
the
absurdity
of
*NL*
quarrelling
on
such
a
hypothetical
subject
,
and
she
the
silliness
of
*NL*
crying
about
what
was
written
in
an
old
book
like
the
Bible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
disturb
your
convictions
--
I
really
wo
n't
!
''
she
went
on
*NL*
soothingly
,
for
now
he
was
rather
more
ruffled
than
she
.
``
But
I
did
*NL*
want
and
long
to
ennoble
some
man
to
high
aims
;
and
when
I
saw
you
,
*NL*
and
knew
you
wanted
to
be
my
comrade
,
I
--
shall
I
confess
it
?
--
thought
*NL*
that
man
might
be
you
.
But
you
take
so
much
tradition
on
trust
that
*NL*
I
do
n't
know
what
to
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
dear
;
I
suppose
one
must
take
some
things
on
trust
.
Life
*NL*
is
n't
long
enough
to
work
out
everything
in
Euclid
problems
before
*NL*
you
believe
it
.
I
take
Christianity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
perhaps
you
might
take
something
worse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
I
might
.
Perhaps
I
have
done
so
!
''
He
thought
of
Arabella
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
ask
what
,
because
we
are
going
to
be
VERY
nice
with
each
*NL*
other
,
are
n't
we
,
and
never
,
never
,
vex
each
other
any
more
?
''
She
*NL*
looked
up
trustfully
,
and
her
voice
seemed
trying
to
nestle
in
his
*NL*
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
always
care
for
you
!
''
said
Jude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
for
you
.
Because
you
are
single-hearted
,
and
forgiving
to
*NL*
your
faulty
and
tiresome
little
Sue
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
away
,
for
that
epicene
tenderness
of
hers
was
too
*NL*
harrowing
.
Was
it
that
which
had
broken
the
heart
of
the
poor
*NL*
leader-writer
;
and
was
he
to
be
the
next
one
?
...
But
Sue
was
so
*NL*
dear
!
...
If
he
could
only
get
over
the
sense
of
her
sex
,
as
she
*NL*
seemed
to
be
able
to
do
so
easily
of
his
,
what
a
comrade
she
would
*NL*
make
;
for
their
difference
of
opinion
on
conjectural
subjects
only
*NL*
drew
them
closer
together
on
matters
of
daily
human
experience
.
She
*NL*
was
nearer
to
him
than
any
other
woman
he
had
ever
met
,
and
he
could
*NL*
scarcely
believe
that
time
,
creed
,
or
absence
,
would
ever
divide
him
*NL*
from
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
his
grief
at
her
incredulities
returned
.
They
sat
on
till
she
*NL*
fell
asleep
again
,
and
he
nodded
in
his
chair
likewise
.
Whenever
*NL*
he
aroused
himself
he
turned
her
things
,
and
made
up
the
fire
anew
.
*NL*
About
six
o'clock
he
awoke
completely
,
and
lighting
a
candle
,
found
*NL*
that
her
clothes
were
dry
.
Her
chair
being
a
far
more
comfortable
*NL*
one
than
his
she
still
slept
on
inside
his
great-coat
,
looking
warm
*NL*
as
a
new
bun
and
boyish
as
a
Ganymede
.
Placing
the
garments
by
her
*NL*
and
touching
her
on
the
shoulder
he
went
downstairs
,
and
washed
*NL*
himself
by
starlight
in
the
yard
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
V
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
returned
she
was
dressed
as
usual
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
could
I
get
out
without
anybody
seeing
me
?
''
she
asked
.
``
The
*NL*
town
is
not
yet
astir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
have
had
no
breakfast
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
want
any
!
I
fear
I
ought
not
to
have
run
away
from
that
*NL*
school
!
Things
seem
so
different
in
the
cold
light
of
morning
,
do
n't
*NL*
they
?
What
Mr.
Phillotson
will
say
I
do
n't
know
!
It
was
quite
by
*NL*
his
wish
that
I
went
there
.
He
is
the
only
man
in
the
world
for
whom
*NL*
I
have
any
respect
or
fear
.
I
hope
he
'll
forgive
me
;
but
he
'll
scold
*NL*
me
dreadfully
,
I
expect
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
go
to
him
and
explain
--
''
began
Jude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
you
sha
n't
.
I
do
n't
care
for
him
!
He
may
think
what
he
*NL*
likes
--
I
shall
do
just
as
I
choose
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
just
this
moment
said
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
if
I
did
,
I
shall
do
as
I
like
for
all
him
!
I
have
thought
of
*NL*
what
I
shall
do
--
go
to
the
sister
of
one
of
my
fellow-students
in
the
*NL*
training-school
,
who
has
asked
me
to
visit
her
.
She
has
a
school
*NL*
near
Shaston
,
about
eighteen
miles
from
here
--
and
I
shall
stay
there
*NL*
till
this
has
blown
over
,
and
I
get
back
to
the
training-school
*NL*
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
last
moment
he
persuaded
her
to
let
him
make
her
a
cup
of
*NL*
coffee
,
in
a
portable
apparatus
he
kept
in
his
room
for
use
on
rising
*NL*
to
go
to
his
work
every
day
before
the
household
was
astir
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
a
dew-bit
to
eat
with
it
,
''
he
said
;
``
and
off
we
go
.
You
can
*NL*
have
a
regular
breakfast
when
you
get
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
quietly
out
of
the
house
,
Jude
accompanying
her
to
the
*NL*
station
.
As
they
departed
along
the
street
a
head
was
thrust
out
*NL*
of
an
upper
window
of
his
lodging
and
quickly
withdrawn
.
Sue
still
*NL*
seemed
sorry
for
her
rashness
,
and
to
wish
she
had
not
rebelled
;
*NL*
telling
him
at
parting
that
she
would
let
him
know
as
soon
as
she
*NL*
got
re-admitted
to
the
training-school
.
They
stood
rather
miserably
*NL*
together
on
the
platform
;
and
it
was
apparent
that
he
wanted
to
say
*NL*
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
tell
you
something
--
two
things
,
''
he
said
hurriedly
as
the
*NL*
train
came
up
.
``
One
is
a
warm
one
,
the
other
a
cold
one
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jude
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
know
one
of
them
.
And
you
must
n't
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
n't
love
me
.
You
are
to
like
me
--
that
's
all
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
's
face
became
so
full
of
complicated
glooms
that
hers
was
*NL*
agitated
in
sympathy
as
she
bade
him
adieu
through
the
carriage
*NL*
window
.
And
then
the
train
moved
on
,
and
waving
her
pretty
hand
to
*NL*
him
she
vanished
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Melchester
was
a
dismal
place
enough
for
Jude
that
Sunday
of
her
*NL*
departure
,
and
the
Close
so
hateful
that
he
did
not
go
once
to
the
*NL*
cathedral
services
.
The
next
morning
there
came
a
letter
from
her
,
*NL*
which
,
with
her
usual
promptitude
,
she
had
written
directly
she
had
*NL*
reached
her
friend
's
house
.
She
told
him
of
her
safe
arrival
and
*NL*
comfortable
quarters
,
and
then
added
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
I
really
write
about
,
dear
Jude
,
is
something
I
said
*NL*
to
you
at
parting
.
You
had
been
so
very
good
and
kind
to
*NL*
me
that
when
you
were
out
of
sight
I
felt
what
a
cruel
and
*NL*
ungrateful
woman
I
was
to
say
it
,
and
it
has
reproached
me
*NL*
ever
since
.
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
LOVE
ME
,
JUDE
,
YOU
MAY
:
I
do
n't
*NL*
mind
at
all
;
and
I
'll
never
say
again
that
you
must
n't
!
*NL*
*NL*
Now
I
wo
n't
write
any
more
about
that
.
You
do
forgive
your
*NL*
thoughtless
friend
for
her
cruelty
?
and
wo
n't
make
her
*NL*
miserable
by
saying
you
do
n't
?
--
Ever
,
*NL*
*NL*
SUE
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
be
superfluous
to
say
what
his
answer
was
;
and
how
he
*NL*
thought
what
he
would
have
done
had
he
been
free
,
which
should
have
*NL*
rendered
a
long
residence
with
a
female
friend
quite
unnecessary
for
*NL*
Sue
.
He
felt
he
might
have
been
pretty
sure
of
his
own
victory
if
*NL*
it
had
come
to
a
conflict
between
Phillotson
and
himself
for
the
*NL*
possession
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
Jude
was
in
danger
of
attaching
more
meaning
to
Sue
's
impulsive
*NL*
note
than
it
really
was
intended
to
bear
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
lapse
of
a
few
days
he
found
himself
hoping
that
she
would
*NL*
write
again
.
But
he
received
no
further
communication
;
and
in
the
*NL*
intensity
of
his
solicitude
he
sent
another
note
,
suggesting
that
he
*NL*
should
pay
her
a
visit
some
Sunday
,
the
distance
being
under
eighteen
*NL*
miles
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
expected
a
reply
on
the
second
morning
after
despatching
his
*NL*
missive
;
but
none
came
.
The
third
morning
arrived
;
the
postman
did
*NL*
not
stop
.
This
was
Saturday
,
and
in
a
feverish
state
of
anxiety
*NL*
about
her
he
sent
off
three
brief
lines
stating
that
he
was
coming
*NL*
the
following
day
,
for
he
felt
sure
something
had
happened
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
first
and
natural
thought
had
been
that
she
was
ill
from
her
*NL*
immersion
;
but
it
soon
occurred
to
him
that
somebody
would
have
*NL*
written
for
her
in
such
a
case
.
Conjectures
were
put
an
end
to
by
*NL*
his
arrival
at
the
village
school-house
near
Shaston
on
the
bright
*NL*
morning
of
Sunday
,
between
eleven
and
twelve
o'clock
,
when
the
parish
*NL*
was
as
vacant
as
a
desert
,
most
of
the
inhabitants
having
gathered
*NL*
inside
the
church
,
whence
their
voices
could
occasionally
be
heard
in
*NL*
unison
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
little
girl
opened
the
door
.
``
Miss
Bridehead
is
up-stairs
,
''
she
*NL*
said
.
``
And
will
you
please
walk
up
to
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
she
ill
?
''
asked
Jude
hastily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
a
little
--
not
very
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
entered
and
ascended
.
On
reaching
the
landing
a
voice
told
him
*NL*
which
way
to
turn
--
the
voice
of
Sue
calling
his
name
.
He
passed
the
*NL*
doorway
,
and
found
her
lying
in
a
little
bed
in
a
room
a
dozen
feet
*NL*
square
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Sue
!
''
he
cried
,
sitting
down
beside
her
and
taking
her
hand
.
*NL*
``
How
is
this
!
You
could
n't
write
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
it
was
n't
that
!
''
she
answered
.
``
I
did
catch
a
bad
cold
--
but
I
*NL*
could
have
written
.
Only
I
would
n't
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
--
frightening
me
like
this
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
that
was
what
I
was
afraid
of
!
But
I
had
decided
not
to
write
*NL*
to
you
any
more
.
They
wo
n't
have
me
back
at
the
school
--
that
's
why
I
*NL*
could
n't
write
.
Not
the
fact
,
but
the
reason
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
not
only
wo
n't
have
me
,
but
they
gave
me
a
parting
piece
of
*NL*
advice
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
answer
directly
.
``
I
vowed
I
never
would
tell
you
,
*NL*
Jude
--
it
is
so
vulgar
and
distressing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
about
us
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
do
tell
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
somebody
has
sent
them
baseless
reports
about
us
,
and
they
*NL*
say
you
and
I
ought
to
marry
as
soon
as
possible
,
for
the
sake
of
my
*NL*
reputation
!
...
There
--
now
I
have
told
you
,
and
I
wish
I
had
n't
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
poor
Sue
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
of
you
like
that
means
!
It
did
just
OCCUR
to
me
to
*NL*
regard
you
in
the
way
they
think
I
do
,
but
I
had
n't
begun
to
.
I
HAVE
*NL*
recognized
that
the
cousinship
was
merely
nominal
,
since
we
met
as
*NL*
total
strangers
.
But
my
marrying
you
,
dear
Jude
--
why
,
of
course
,
*NL*
if
I
had
reckoned
upon
marrying
you
I
should
n't
have
come
to
you
so
*NL*
often
!
And
I
never
supposed
you
thought
of
such
a
thing
as
marrying
*NL*
me
till
the
other
evening
;
when
I
began
to
fancy
you
did
love
me
a
*NL*
little
.
Perhaps
I
ought
not
to
have
been
so
intimate
with
you
.
It
*NL*
is
all
my
fault
.
Everything
is
my
fault
always
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
speech
seemed
a
little
forced
and
unreal
,
and
they
regarded
each
*NL*
other
with
a
mutual
distress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
so
blind
at
first
!
''
she
went
on
.
``
I
did
n't
see
what
you
felt
*NL*
at
all
.
Oh
,
you
have
been
unkind
to
me
--
you
have
--
to
look
upon
me
*NL*
as
a
sweetheart
without
saying
a
word
,
and
leaving
me
to
discover
it
*NL*
myself
!
Your
attitude
to
me
has
become
known
;
and
naturally
they
*NL*
think
we
've
been
doing
wrong
!
I
'll
never
trust
you
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Sue
,
''
he
said
simply
;
``
I
am
to
blame
--
more
than
you
think
.
I
*NL*
was
quite
aware
that
you
did
not
suspect
till
within
the
last
meeting
*NL*
or
two
what
I
was
feeling
about
you
.
I
admit
that
our
meeting
as
*NL*
strangers
prevented
a
sense
of
relationship
,
and
that
it
was
a
sort
*NL*
of
subterfuge
to
avail
myself
of
it
.
But
do
n't
you
think
I
deserve
a
*NL*
little
consideration
for
concealing
my
wrong
,
very
wrong
,
sentiments
,
*NL*
since
I
could
n't
help
having
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
her
eyes
doubtfully
towards
him
,
and
then
looked
away
as
*NL*
if
afraid
she
might
forgive
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
every
law
of
nature
and
sex
a
kiss
was
the
only
rejoinder
that
*NL*
fitted
the
mood
and
the
moment
,
under
the
suasion
of
which
Sue
's
*NL*
undemonstrative
regard
of
him
might
not
inconceivably
have
changed
*NL*
its
temperature
.
Some
men
would
have
cast
scruples
to
the
winds
,
*NL*
and
ventured
it
,
oblivious
both
of
Sue
's
declaration
of
her
neutral
*NL*
feelings
,
and
of
the
pair
of
autographs
in
the
vestry
chest
of
*NL*
Arabella
's
parish
church
.
Jude
did
not
.
He
had
,
in
fact
,
come
in
*NL*
part
to
tell
his
own
fatal
story
.
It
was
upon
his
lips
;
yet
at
the
*NL*
hour
of
this
distress
he
could
not
disclose
it
.
He
preferred
to
*NL*
dwell
upon
the
recognized
barriers
between
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
--
I
know
you
do
n't
--
care
about
me
in
any
particular
way
,
''
*NL*
he
sorrowed
.
``
You
ought
not
,
and
you
are
right
.
You
belong
to
--
Mr.
*NL*
Phillotson
.
I
suppose
he
has
been
to
see
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
said
shortly
,
her
face
changing
a
little
.
``
Though
I
*NL*
did
n't
ask
him
to
come
.
You
are
glad
,
of
course
,
that
he
has
been
!
*NL*
But
I
should
n't
care
if
he
did
n't
come
any
more
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
very
perplexing
to
her
lover
that
she
should
be
piqued
at
his
*NL*
honest
acquiescence
in
his
rival
,
if
Jude
's
feelings
of
love
were
*NL*
deprecated
by
her
.
He
went
on
to
something
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
will
blow
over
,
dear
Sue
,
''
he
said
.
``
The
training-school
*NL*
authorities
are
not
all
the
world
.
You
can
get
to
be
a
student
in
*NL*
some
other
,
no
doubt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
ask
Mr.
Phillotson
,
''
she
said
decisively
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sue
's
kind
hostess
now
returned
from
church
,
and
there
was
no
more
*NL*
intimate
conversation
.
Jude
left
in
the
afternoon
,
hopelessly
*NL*
unhappy
.
But
he
had
seen
her
,
and
sat
with
her
.
Such
intercourse
*NL*
as
that
would
have
to
content
him
for
the
remainder
of
his
life
.
*NL*
The
lesson
of
renunciation
it
was
necessary
and
proper
that
he
,
as
*NL*
a
parish
priest
,
should
learn
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
next
morning
when
he
awoke
he
felt
rather
vexed
with
her
,
*NL*
and
decided
that
she
was
rather
unreasonable
,
not
to
say
capricious
.
*NL*
Then
,
in
illustration
of
what
he
had
begun
to
discern
as
one
of
her
*NL*
redeeming
characteristics
there
came
promptly
a
note
,
which
she
must
*NL*
have
written
almost
immediately
he
had
gone
from
her
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Forgive
me
for
my
petulance
yesterday
!
I
was
horrid
to
*NL*
you
;
I
know
it
,
and
I
feel
perfectly
miserable
at
my
*NL*
horridness
.
It
was
so
dear
of
you
not
to
be
angry
!
Jude
,
*NL*
please
still
keep
me
as
your
friend
and
associate
,
with
*NL*
all
my
faults
.
I
'll
try
not
to
be
like
it
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
coming
to
Melchester
on
Saturday
,
to
get
my
things
*NL*
away
from
the
T.
S.
,
&
c.
I
could
walk
with
you
for
half
*NL*
an
hour
,
if
you
would
like
?
--
Your
repentant
*NL*
*NL*
SUE
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
forgave
her
straightway
,
and
asked
her
to
call
for
him
at
the
*NL*
cathedral
works
when
she
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
VI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
a
middle-aged
man
was
dreaming
a
dream
of
great
beauty
*NL*
concerning
the
writer
of
the
above
letter
.
He
was
Richard
*NL*
Phillotson
,
who
had
recently
removed
from
the
mixed
village
school
at
*NL*
Lumsdon
near
Christminster
,
to
undertake
a
large
boys
'
school
in
his
*NL*
native
town
of
Shaston
,
which
stood
on
a
hill
sixty
miles
to
the
*NL*
south-west
as
the
crow
flies
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
glance
at
the
place
and
its
accessories
was
almost
enough
to
reveal
*NL*
that
the
schoolmaster
's
plans
and
dreams
so
long
indulged
in
had
*NL*
been
abandoned
for
some
new
dream
with
which
neither
the
Church
nor
*NL*
literature
had
much
in
common
.
Essentially
an
unpractical
man
,
he
*NL*
was
now
bent
on
making
and
saving
money
for
a
practical
purpose
--
that
*NL*
of
keeping
a
wife
,
who
,
if
she
chose
,
might
conduct
one
of
the
girls
'
*NL*
schools
adjoining
his
own
;
for
which
purpose
he
had
advised
her
to
go
*NL*
into
training
,
since
she
would
not
marry
him
offhand
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
the
time
that
Jude
was
removing
from
Marygreen
to
Melchester
,
*NL*
and
entering
on
adventures
at
the
latter
place
with
Sue
,
the
*NL*
schoolmaster
was
settling
down
in
the
new
school-house
at
Shaston
.
*NL*
All
the
furniture
being
fixed
,
the
books
shelved
,
and
the
nails
*NL*
driven
,
he
had
begun
to
sit
in
his
parlour
during
the
dark
winter
*NL*
nights
and
re-attempt
some
of
his
old
studies
--
one
branch
of
*NL*
which
had
included
Roman-Britannic
antiquities
--
an
unremunerative
*NL*
labour
for
a
national
school-master
but
a
subject
,
that
,
after
his
*NL*
abandonment
of
the
university
scheme
,
had
interested
him
as
being
a
*NL*
comparatively
unworked
mine
;
practicable
to
those
who
,
like
himself
,
*NL*
had
lived
in
lonely
spots
where
these
remains
were
abundant
,
and
were
*NL*
seen
to
compel
inferences
in
startling
contrast
to
accepted
views
on
*NL*
the
civilization
of
that
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
resumption
of
this
investigation
was
the
outward
and
apparent
hobby
*NL*
of
Phillotson
at
present
--
his
ostensible
reason
for
going
alone
into
*NL*
fields
where
causeways
,
dykes
,
and
tumuli
abounded
,
or
shutting
*NL*
himself
up
in
his
house
with
a
few
urns
,
tiles
,
and
mosaics
he
had
*NL*
collected
,
instead
of
calling
round
upon
his
new
neighbours
,
who
for
*NL*
their
part
had
showed
themselves
willing
enough
to
be
friendly
with
*NL*
him
.
But
it
was
not
the
real
,
or
the
whole
,
reason
,
after
all
.
*NL*
Thus
on
a
particular
evening
in
the
month
,
when
it
had
grown
quite
*NL*
late
--
to
near
midnight
,
indeed
--
and
the
light
of
his
lamp
,
shining
*NL*
from
his
window
at
a
salient
angle
of
the
hill-top
town
over
infinite
*NL*
miles
of
valley
westward
,
announced
as
by
words
a
place
and
person
*NL*
given
over
to
study
,
he
was
not
exactly
studying
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
interior
of
the
room
--
the
books
,
the
furniture
,
the
*NL*
schoolmaster
's
loose
coat
,
his
attitude
at
the
table
,
even
the
*NL*
flickering
of
the
fire
,
bespoke
the
same
dignified
tale
of
*NL*
undistracted
research
--
more
than
creditable
to
a
man
who
had
had
no
*NL*
advantages
beyond
those
of
his
own
making
.
And
yet
the
tale
,
true
*NL*
enough
till
latterly
,
was
not
true
now
.
What
he
was
regarding
was
*NL*
not
history
.
They
were
historic
notes
,
written
in
a
bold
womanly
*NL*
hand
at
his
dictation
some
months
before
,
and
it
was
the
clerical
*NL*
rendering
of
word
after
word
that
absorbed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
presently
took
from
a
drawer
a
carefully
tied
bundle
of
letters
,
*NL*
few
,
very
few
,
as
correspondence
counts
nowadays
.
Each
was
in
its
*NL*
envelope
just
as
it
had
arrived
,
and
the
handwriting
was
of
the
same
*NL*
womanly
character
as
the
historic
notes
.
He
unfolded
them
one
by
*NL*
one
and
read
them
musingly
.
At
first
sight
there
seemed
in
these
*NL*
small
documents
to
be
absolutely
nothing
to
muse
over
.
They
were
*NL*
straightforward
,
frank
letters
,
signed
``
Sue
B
--
''
;
just
such
ones
as
*NL*
would
be
written
during
short
absences
,
with
no
other
thought
than
*NL*
their
speedy
destruction
,
and
chiefly
concerning
books
in
reading
*NL*
and
other
experiences
of
a
training
school
,
forgotten
doubtless
by
*NL*
the
writer
with
the
passing
of
the
day
of
their
inditing
.
In
one
of
*NL*
them
--
quite
a
recent
note
--
the
young
woman
said
that
she
had
received
*NL*
his
considerate
letter
,
and
that
it
was
honourable
and
generous
of
*NL*
him
to
say
he
would
not
come
to
see
her
oftener
than
she
desired
-LRB-
the
*NL*
school
being
such
an
awkward
place
for
callers
,
and
because
of
her
*NL*
strong
wish
that
her
engagement
to
him
should
not
be
known
,
which
it
*NL*
would
infallibly
be
if
he
visited
her
often
-RRB-
.
Over
these
phrases
the
*NL*
school-master
pored
.
What
precise
shade
of
satisfaction
was
to
be
*NL*
gathered
from
a
woman
's
gratitude
that
the
man
who
loved
her
had
not
*NL*
been
often
to
see
her
?
The
problem
occupied
him
,
distracted
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
opened
another
drawer
,
and
found
therein
an
envelope
,
from
which
*NL*
he
drew
a
photograph
of
Sue
as
a
child
,
long
before
he
had
known
her
,
*NL*
standing
under
trellis-work
with
a
little
basket
in
her
hand
.
There
*NL*
was
another
of
her
as
a
young
woman
,
her
dark
eyes
and
hair
making
a
*NL*
very
distinct
and
attractive
picture
of
her
,
which
just
disclosed
,
*NL*
too
,
the
thoughtfulness
that
lay
behind
her
lighter
moods
.
It
was
*NL*
a
duplicate
of
the
one
she
had
given
Jude
,
and
would
have
given
to
*NL*
any
man
.
Phillotson
brought
it
half-way
to
his
lips
,
but
withdrew
*NL*
it
in
doubt
at
her
perplexing
phrases
:
ultimately
kissing
the
*NL*
dead
pasteboard
with
all
the
passionateness
,
and
more
than
all
the
*NL*
devotion
,
of
a
young
man
of
eighteen
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
schoolmaster
's
was
an
unhealthy-looking
,
old-fashioned
face
,
*NL*
rendered
more
old-fashioned
by
his
style
of
shaving
.
A
certain
*NL*
gentlemanliness
had
been
imparted
to
it
by
nature
,
suggesting
an
*NL*
inherent
wish
to
do
rightly
by
all
.
His
speech
was
a
little
slow
,
*NL*
but
his
tones
were
sincere
enough
to
make
his
hesitation
no
defect
.
*NL*
His
greying
hair
was
curly
,
and
radiated
from
a
point
in
the
middle
*NL*
of
his
crown
.
There
were
four
lines
across
his
forehead
,
and
he
only
*NL*
wore
spectacles
when
reading
at
night
.
It
was
almost
certainly
a
*NL*
renunciation
forced
upon
him
by
his
academic
purpose
,
rather
than
a
*NL*
distaste
for
women
,
which
had
hitherto
kept
him
from
closing
with
one
*NL*
of
the
sex
in
matrimony
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
silent
proceedings
as
those
of
this
evening
were
repeated
many
*NL*
and
oft
times
when
he
was
not
under
the
eye
of
the
boys
,
whose
quick
*NL*
and
penetrating
regard
would
frequently
become
almost
intolerable
to
*NL*
the
self-conscious
master
in
his
present
anxious
care
for
Sue
,
making
*NL*
him
,
in
the
grey
hours
of
morning
,
dread
to
meet
anew
the
gimlet
*NL*
glances
,
lest
they
should
read
what
the
dream
within
him
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
honourably
acquiesced
in
Sue
's
announced
wish
that
he
was
*NL*
not
often
to
visit
her
at
the
training
school
;
but
at
length
,
his
*NL*
patience
being
sorely
tried
,
he
set
out
one
Saturday
afternoon
to
pay
*NL*
her
an
unexpected
call
.
There
the
news
of
her
departure
--
expulsion
*NL*
as
it
might
almost
have
been
considered
--
was
flashed
upon
him
without
*NL*
warning
or
mitigation
as
he
stood
at
the
door
expecting
in
a
few
*NL*
minutes
to
behold
her
face
;
and
when
he
turned
away
he
could
hardly
*NL*
see
the
road
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sue
had
,
in
fact
,
never
written
a
line
to
her
suitor
on
the
subject
,
*NL*
although
it
was
fourteen
days
old
.
A
short
reflection
told
him
that
*NL*
this
proved
nothing
,
a
natural
delicacy
being
as
ample
a
reason
for
*NL*
silence
as
any
degree
of
blameworthiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
informed
him
at
the
school
where
she
was
living
,
and
having
*NL*
no
immediate
anxiety
about
her
comfort
,
his
thoughts
took
the
*NL*
direction
of
a
burning
indignation
against
the
training
school
*NL*
committee
.
In
his
bewilderment
Phillotson
entered
the
adjacent
*NL*
cathedral
,
just
now
in
a
direly
dismantled
state
by
reason
of
*NL*
the
repairs
.
He
sat
down
on
a
block
of
freestone
,
regardless
of
*NL*
the
dusty
imprint
it
made
on
his
breeches
;
and
his
listless
eyes
*NL*
following
the
movements
of
the
workmen
he
presently
became
aware
*NL*
that
the
reputed
culprit
,
Sue
's
lover
Jude
,
was
one
amongst
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
had
never
spoken
to
his
former
hero
since
the
meeting
by
the
*NL*
model
of
Jerusalem
.
Having
inadvertently
witnessed
Phillotson
's
*NL*
tentative
courtship
of
Sue
in
the
lane
there
had
grown
up
in
the
*NL*
younger
man
's
mind
a
curious
dislike
to
think
of
the
elder
,
to
meet
*NL*
him
,
to
communicate
in
any
way
with
him
;
and
since
Phillotson
's
*NL*
success
in
obtaining
at
least
her
promise
had
become
known
to
Jude
,
*NL*
he
had
frankly
recognized
that
he
did
not
wish
to
see
or
hear
of
his
*NL*
senior
any
more
,
learn
anything
of
his
pursuits
,
or
even
imagine
*NL*
again
what
excellencies
might
appertain
to
his
character
.
On
this
*NL*
very
day
of
the
schoolmaster
's
visit
Jude
was
expecting
Sue
,
as
she
*NL*
had
promised
;
and
when
therefore
he
saw
the
schoolmaster
in
the
nave
*NL*
of
the
building
,
saw
,
moreover
,
that
he
was
coming
to
speak
to
him
,
*NL*
he
felt
no
little
embarrassment
;
which
Phillotson
's
own
embarrassment
*NL*
prevented
his
observing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
joined
him
,
and
they
both
withdrew
from
the
other
workmen
to
the
*NL*
spot
where
Phillotson
had
been
sitting
.
Jude
offered
him
a
piece
of
*NL*
sackcloth
for
a
cushion
,
and
told
him
it
was
dangerous
to
sit
on
the
*NL*
bare
block
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
yes
,
''
said
Phillotson
abstractedly
,
as
he
reseated
himself
,
his
*NL*
eyes
resting
on
the
ground
as
if
he
were
trying
to
remember
where
he
*NL*
was
.
``
I
wo
n't
keep
you
long
.
It
was
merely
that
I
have
heard
that
*NL*
you
have
seen
my
little
friend
Sue
recently
.
It
occurred
to
me
to
*NL*
speak
to
you
on
that
account
.
I
merely
want
to
ask
--
about
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
know
what
!
''
Jude
hurriedly
said
.
``
About
her
escaping
*NL*
from
the
training
school
,
and
her
coming
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
''
--
Jude
for
a
moment
felt
an
unprincipled
and
fiendish
wish
to
*NL*
annihilate
his
rival
at
all
cost
.
By
the
exercise
of
that
treachery
*NL*
which
love
for
the
same
woman
renders
possible
to
men
the
most
*NL*
honourable
in
every
other
relation
of
life
,
he
could
send
off
*NL*
Phillotson
in
agony
and
defeat
by
saying
that
the
scandal
was
true
,
*NL*
and
that
Sue
had
irretrievably
committed
herself
with
him
.
But
his
*NL*
action
did
not
respond
for
a
moment
to
his
animal
instinct
;
and
what
*NL*
he
said
was
,
``
I
am
glad
of
your
kindness
in
coming
to
talk
plainly
to
*NL*
me
about
it
.
You
know
what
they
say
?
--
that
I
ought
to
marry
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
wish
with
all
my
soul
I
could
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Phillotson
trembled
,
and
his
naturally
pale
face
acquired
a
*NL*
corpselike
sharpness
in
its
lines
.
``
I
had
no
idea
that
it
was
of
*NL*
this
nature
!
God
forbid
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
!
''
said
Jude
aghast
.
``
I
thought
you
understood
?
I
mean
that
*NL*
were
I
in
a
position
to
marry
her
,
or
someone
,
and
settle
down
,
*NL*
instead
of
living
in
lodgings
here
and
there
,
I
should
be
glad
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
he
had
really
meant
was
simply
that
he
loved
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
--
since
this
painful
matter
has
been
opened
up
--
what
really
*NL*
happened
?
''
asked
Phillotson
,
with
the
firmness
of
a
man
who
felt
that
*NL*
a
sharp
smart
now
was
better
than
a
long
agony
of
suspense
hereafter
.
*NL*
``
Cases
arise
,
and
this
is
one
,
when
even
ungenerous
questions
must
be
*NL*
put
to
make
false
assumptions
impossible
,
and
to
kill
scandal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
explained
readily
;
giving
the
whole
series
of
adventures
,
*NL*
including
the
night
at
the
shepherd
's
,
her
wet
arrival
at
his
*NL*
lodging
,
her
indisposition
from
her
immersion
,
their
vigil
of
*NL*
discussion
,
and
his
seeing
her
off
next
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
''
said
Phillotson
at
the
conclusion
,
``
I
take
it
as
your
*NL*
final
word
,
and
I
know
I
can
believe
you
,
that
the
suspicion
which
*NL*
led
to
her
rustication
is
an
absolutely
baseless
one
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
,
''
said
Jude
solemnly
.
``
Absolutely
.
So
help
me
God
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
schoolmaster
rose
.
Each
of
the
twain
felt
that
the
interview
*NL*
could
not
comfortably
merge
in
a
friendly
discussion
of
their
recent
*NL*
experiences
,
after
the
manner
of
friends
;
and
when
Jude
had
taken
him
*NL*
round
,
and
shown
him
some
features
of
the
renovation
which
the
old
*NL*
cathedral
was
undergoing
,
Phillotson
bade
the
young
man
good-day
and
*NL*
went
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
visit
took
place
about
eleven
o'clock
in
the
morning
;
but
no
Sue
*NL*
appeared
.
When
Jude
went
to
his
dinner
at
one
he
saw
his
beloved
*NL*
ahead
of
him
in
the
street
leading
up
from
the
North
Gate
,
walking
*NL*
as
if
no
way
looking
for
him
.
Speedily
overtaking
her
he
remarked
*NL*
that
he
had
asked
her
to
come
to
him
at
the
cathedral
,
and
she
had
*NL*
promised
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
to
get
my
things
from
the
college
,
''
she
said
--
an
*NL*
observation
which
he
was
expected
to
take
as
an
answer
,
though
it
was
*NL*
not
one
.
Finding
her
to
be
in
this
evasive
mood
he
felt
inclined
to
*NL*
give
her
the
information
so
long
withheld
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
not
seen
Mr.
Phillotson
to-day
?
''
he
ventured
to
inquire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
.
But
I
am
not
going
to
be
cross-examined
about
him
;
and
*NL*
if
you
ask
anything
more
I
wo
n't
answer
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
very
odd
that
--
''
He
stopped
,
regarding
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
you
are
often
not
so
nice
in
your
real
presence
as
you
are
in
*NL*
your
letters
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
it
really
seem
so
to
you
?
''
said
she
,
smiling
with
quick
*NL*
curiosity
.
``
Well
,
that
's
strange
;
but
I
feel
just
the
same
about
*NL*
you
,
Jude
.
When
you
are
gone
away
I
seem
such
a
coldhearted
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
knew
his
sentiment
towards
her
Jude
saw
that
they
were
getting
*NL*
upon
dangerous
ground
.
It
was
now
,
he
thought
,
that
he
must
speak
as
*NL*
an
honest
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
did
not
speak
,
and
she
continued
:
``
It
was
that
which
made
me
*NL*
write
and
say
--
I
did
n't
mind
your
loving
me
--
if
you
wanted
to
,
much
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
exultation
he
might
have
felt
at
what
that
implied
,
or
seemed
to
*NL*
imply
,
was
nullified
by
his
intention
,
and
he
rested
rigid
till
he
*NL*
began
:
``
I
have
never
told
you
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
you
have
,
''
murmured
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
,
I
have
never
told
you
my
history
--
all
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
guess
it
.
I
know
nearly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
looked
up
.
Could
she
possibly
know
of
that
morning
performance
*NL*
of
his
with
Arabella
;
which
in
a
few
months
had
ceased
to
be
a
*NL*
marriage
more
completely
than
by
death
?
He
saw
that
she
did
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
quite
tell
you
here
in
the
street
,
''
he
went
on
with
a
gloomy
*NL*
tongue
.
``
And
you
had
better
not
come
to
my
lodgings
.
Let
us
go
in
*NL*
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
building
by
which
they
stood
was
the
market-house
;
it
was
the
*NL*
only
place
available
;
and
they
entered
,
the
market
being
over
,
and
*NL*
the
stalls
and
areas
empty
.
He
would
have
preferred
a
more
congenial
*NL*
spot
,
but
,
as
usually
happens
,
in
place
of
a
romantic
field
or
solemn
*NL*
aisle
for
his
tale
,
it
was
told
while
they
walked
up
and
down
over
a
*NL*
floor
littered
with
rotten
cabbage-leaves
,
and
amid
all
the
usual
*NL*
squalors
of
decayed
vegetable
matter
and
unsaleable
refuse
.
He
*NL*
began
and
finished
his
brief
narrative
,
which
merely
led
up
to
the
*NL*
information
that
he
had
married
a
wife
some
years
earlier
,
and
that
*NL*
his
wife
was
living
still
.
Almost
before
her
countenance
had
time
to
*NL*
change
she
hurried
out
the
words
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
n't
you
tell
me
before
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
n't
.
It
seemed
so
cruel
to
tell
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
yourself
,
Jude
.
So
it
was
better
to
be
cruel
to
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
dear
darling
!
''
cried
Jude
passionately
.
He
tried
to
take
her
*NL*
hand
,
but
she
withdrew
it
.
Their
old
relations
of
confidence
seemed
*NL*
suddenly
to
have
ended
,
and
the
antagonisms
of
sex
to
sex
were
left
*NL*
without
any
counter-poising
predilections
.
She
was
his
comrade
,
*NL*
friend
,
unconscious
sweetheart
no
longer
;
and
her
eyes
regarded
him
*NL*
in
estranged
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
ashamed
of
the
episode
in
my
life
which
brought
about
the
*NL*
marriage
,
''
he
continued
.
``
I
ca
n't
explain
it
precisely
now
.
I
could
*NL*
have
done
it
if
you
had
taken
it
differently
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
can
I
?
''
she
burst
out
.
``
Here
I
have
been
saying
,
or
*NL*
writing
,
that
--
that
you
might
love
me
,
or
something
of
the
*NL*
sort
!
--
just
out
of
charity
--
and
all
the
time
--
oh
,
it
is
perfectly
*NL*
damnable
how
things
are
!
''
she
said
,
stamping
her
foot
in
a
nervous
*NL*
quiver
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
take
me
wrong
,
Sue
!
I
never
thought
you
cared
for
me
at
all
,
*NL*
till
quite
lately
;
so
I
felt
it
did
not
matter
!
Do
you
care
for
me
,
*NL*
Sue
?
--
you
know
how
I
mean
?
--
I
do
n't
like
`
out
of
charity
'
at
all
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
question
which
in
the
circumstances
Sue
did
not
choose
to
*NL*
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
she
--
your
wife
--
is
--
a
very
pretty
woman
,
even
if
she
's
*NL*
wicked
?
''
she
asked
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
pretty
enough
,
as
far
as
that
goes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Prettier
than
I
am
,
no
doubt
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
the
least
alike
.
And
I
have
never
seen
her
for
*NL*
years
...
But
she
's
sure
to
come
back
--
they
always
do
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
strange
of
you
to
stay
apart
from
her
like
this
!
''
said
Sue
,
*NL*
her
trembling
lip
and
lumpy
throat
belying
her
irony
.
``
You
,
such
a
*NL*
religious
man
.
How
will
the
demi-gods
in
your
Pantheon
--
I
mean
those
*NL*
legendary
persons
you
call
saints
--
intercede
for
you
after
this
?
*NL*
Now
if
I
had
done
such
a
thing
it
would
have
been
different
,
and
not
*NL*
remarkable
,
for
I
at
least
do
n't
regard
marriage
as
a
sacrament
.
*NL*
Your
theories
are
not
so
advanced
as
your
practice
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sue
,
you
are
terribly
cutting
when
you
like
to
be
--
a
perfect
*NL*
Voltaire
!
But
you
must
treat
me
as
you
will
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
saw
how
wretched
he
was
she
softened
,
and
trying
to
blink
*NL*
away
her
sympathetic
tears
said
with
all
the
winning
reproachfulness
*NL*
of
a
heart-hurt
woman
:
``
Ah
--
you
should
have
told
me
before
you
gave
*NL*
me
that
idea
that
you
wanted
to
be
allowed
to
love
me
!
I
had
no
*NL*
feeling
before
that
moment
at
the
railway-station
,
except
--
''
For
*NL*
once
Sue
was
as
miserable
as
he
,
in
her
attempts
to
keep
herself
free
*NL*
from
emotion
,
and
her
less
than
half-success
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
cry
,
dear
!
''
he
implored
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
--
not
crying
--
because
I
meant
to
--
love
you
;
but
because
of
your
*NL*
want
of
--
confidence
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
quite
screened
from
the
market-square
without
,
and
he
could
*NL*
not
help
putting
out
his
arm
towards
her
waist
.
His
momentary
desire
*NL*
was
the
means
of
her
rallying
.
``
No
,
no
!
''
she
said
,
drawing
back
*NL*
stringently
,
and
wiping
her
eyes
.
``
Of
course
not
!
It
would
be
*NL*
hypocrisy
to
pretend
that
it
would
be
meant
as
from
my
cousin
;
and
it
*NL*
ca
n't
be
in
any
other
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
moved
on
a
dozen
paces
,
and
she
showed
herself
recovered
.
It
*NL*
was
distracting
to
Jude
,
and
his
heart
would
have
ached
less
had
she
*NL*
appeared
anyhow
but
as
she
did
appear
;
essentially
large-minded
and
*NL*
generous
on
reflection
,
despite
a
previous
exercise
of
those
narrow
*NL*
womanly
humours
on
impulse
that
were
necessary
to
give
her
sex
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
blame
you
for
what
you
could
n't
help
,
''
she
said
,
smiling
.
*NL*
``
How
should
I
be
so
foolish
?
I
do
blame
you
a
little
bit
for
not
*NL*
telling
me
before
.
But
,
after
all
,
it
does
n't
matter
.
We
should
*NL*
have
had
to
keep
apart
,
you
see
,
even
if
this
had
not
been
in
your
*NL*
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
we
should
n't
,
Sue
!
This
is
the
only
obstacle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
forget
that
I
must
have
loved
you
,
and
wanted
to
be
your
*NL*
wife
,
even
if
there
had
been
no
obstacle
,
''
said
Sue
,
with
a
gentle
*NL*
seriousness
which
did
not
reveal
her
mind
.
``
And
then
we
are
cousins
,
*NL*
and
it
is
bad
for
cousins
to
marry
.
And
--
I
am
engaged
to
somebody
*NL*
else
.
As
to
our
going
on
together
as
we
were
going
,
in
a
sort
of
*NL*
friendly
way
,
the
people
round
us
would
have
made
it
unable
to
*NL*
continue
.
Their
views
of
the
relations
of
man
and
woman
are
limited
,
*NL*
as
is
proved
by
their
expelling
me
from
the
school
.
Their
philosophy
*NL*
only
recognizes
relations
based
on
animal
desire
.
The
wide
field
*NL*
of
strong
attachment
where
desire
plays
,
at
least
,
only
a
secondary
*NL*
part
,
is
ignored
by
them
--
the
part
of
--
who
is
it
?
--
Venus
Urania
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
being
able
to
talk
learnedly
showed
that
she
was
mistress
of
*NL*
herself
again
;
and
before
they
parted
she
had
almost
regained
her
*NL*
vivacious
glance
,
her
reciprocity
of
tone
,
her
gay
manner
,
and
her
*NL*
second-thought
attitude
of
critical
largeness
towards
others
of
her
*NL*
age
and
sex
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
speak
more
freely
now
.
``
There
were
several
reasons
against
*NL*
my
telling
you
rashly
.
One
was
what
I
have
said
;
another
,
that
*NL*
it
was
always
impressed
upon
me
that
I
ought
not
to
marry
--
that
*NL*
I
belonged
to
an
odd
and
peculiar
family
--
the
wrong
breed
for
*NL*
marriage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
--
who
used
to
say
that
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
great-aunt
.
She
said
it
always
ended
badly
with
us
Fawleys
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
strange
.
My
father
used
to
say
the
same
to
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
stood
possessed
by
the
same
thought
,
ugly
enough
,
even
as
an
*NL*
assumption
:
that
a
union
between
them
,
had
such
been
possible
,
would
*NL*
have
meant
a
terrible
intensification
of
unfitness
--
two
bitters
in
*NL*
one
dish
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
there
ca
n't
be
anything
in
it
!
''
she
said
with
nervous
*NL*
lightness
.
``
Our
family
have
been
unlucky
of
late
years
in
choosing
*NL*
mates
--
that
's
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
they
pretended
to
persuade
themselves
that
all
that
had
*NL*
happened
was
of
no
consequence
,
and
that
they
could
still
be
cousins
*NL*
and
friends
and
warm
correspondents
,
and
have
happy
genial
times
*NL*
when
they
met
,
even
if
they
met
less
frequently
than
before
.
Their
*NL*
parting
was
in
good
friendship
,
and
yet
Jude
's
last
look
into
her
*NL*
eyes
was
tinged
with
inquiry
,
for
he
felt
that
he
did
not
even
now
*NL*
quite
know
her
mind
.

VII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Tidings
from
Sue
a
day
or
two
after
passed
across
Jude
like
a
*NL*
withering
blast
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
reading
the
letter
he
was
led
to
suspect
that
its
contents
*NL*
were
of
a
somewhat
serious
kind
by
catching
sight
of
the
*NL*
signature
--
which
was
in
her
full
name
,
never
used
in
her
*NL*
correspondence
with
him
since
her
first
note
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
MY
DEAR
JUDE
,
--
I
have
something
to
tell
you
which
perhaps
*NL*
you
will
not
be
surprised
to
hear
,
though
certainly
it
may
*NL*
strike
you
as
being
accelerated
-LRB-
as
the
railway
companies
*NL*
say
of
their
trains
-RRB-
.
Mr.
Phillotson
and
I
are
to
be
married
*NL*
quite
soon
--
in
three
or
four
weeks
.
We
had
intended
,
as
you
*NL*
know
,
to
wait
till
I
had
gone
through
my
course
of
training
*NL*
and
obtained
my
certificate
,
so
as
to
assist
him
,
if
*NL*
necessary
,
in
the
teaching
.
But
he
generously
says
he
does
*NL*
not
see
any
object
in
waiting
,
now
I
am
not
at
the
training
*NL*
school
.
It
is
so
good
of
him
,
because
the
awkwardness
of
my
*NL*
situation
has
really
come
about
by
my
fault
in
getting
*NL*
expelled
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wish
me
joy
.
Remember
I
say
you
are
to
,
and
you
must
n't
*NL*
refuse
!

Your
affectionate
cousin

SUSANNA

BRIDEHEAD

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
staggered
under
the
news
;
could
eat
no
breakfast
;
and
kept
on
*NL*
drinking
tea
because
his
mouth
was
so
dry
.
Then
presently
he
went
*NL*
back
to
his
work
and
laughed
the
usual
bitter
laugh
of
a
man
so
*NL*
confronted
.
Everything
seemed
turning
to
satire
.
And
yet
,
what
*NL*
could
the
poor
girl
do
?
he
asked
himself
,
and
felt
worse
than
*NL*
shedding
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
Susanna
Florence
Mary
!
''
he
said
as
he
worked
.
``
You
do
n't
know
*NL*
what
marriage
means
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Could
it
be
possible
that
his
announcement
of
his
own
marriage
had
*NL*
pricked
her
on
to
this
,
just
as
his
visit
to
her
when
in
liquor
may
*NL*
have
pricked
her
on
to
her
engagement
?
To
be
sure
,
there
seemed
to
*NL*
exist
these
other
and
sufficient
reasons
,
practical
and
social
,
for
*NL*
her
decision
;
but
Sue
was
not
a
very
practical
or
calculating
person
;
*NL*
and
he
was
compelled
to
think
that
a
pique
at
having
his
secret
*NL*
sprung
upon
her
had
moved
her
to
give
way
to
Phillotson
's
probable
*NL*
representations
,
that
the
best
course
to
prove
how
unfounded
were
the
*NL*
suspicions
of
the
school
authorities
would
be
to
marry
him
off-hand
,
*NL*
as
in
fulfilment
of
an
ordinary
engagement
.
Sue
had
,
in
fact
,
been
*NL*
placed
in
an
awkward
corner
.
Poor
Sue
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
determined
to
play
the
Spartan
;
to
make
the
best
of
it
,
and
*NL*
support
her
;
but
he
could
not
write
the
requested
good
wishes
for
a
*NL*
day
or
two
.
Meanwhile
there
came
another
note
from
his
impatient
*NL*
little
dear
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
,
will
you
give
me
away
?
I
have
nobody
else
who
could
*NL*
do
it
so
conveniently
as
you
,
being
the
only
married
relation
*NL*
I
have
here
on
the
spot
,
even
if
my
father
were
friendly
*NL*
enough
to
be
willing
,
which
he
is
n't
.
I
hope
you
wo
n't
think
*NL*
it
a
trouble
?
I
have
been
looking
at
the
marriage
service
in
*NL*
the
prayer-book
,
and
it
seems
to
me
very
humiliating
that
a
*NL*
giver-away
should
be
required
at
all
.
According
to
the
*NL*
ceremony
as
there
printed
,
my
bridegroom
chooses
me
of
his
*NL*
own
will
and
pleasure
;
but
I
do
n't
choose
him
.
Somebody
*NL*
GIVES
me
to
him
,
like
a
she-ass
or
she-goat
,
or
any
other
*NL*
domestic
animal
.
Bless
your
exalted
views
of
woman
,
O
*NL*
churchman
!
But
I
forget
:
I
am
no
longer
privileged
to
tease
*NL*
you
.

Ever

SUSANNA
FLORENCE
MARY
BRIDEHEAD
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
screwed
himself
up
to
heroic
key
;
and
replied
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
MY
DEAR
SUE
,
--
Of
course
I
wish
you
joy
!
And
also
of
course
*NL*
I
will
give
you
away
.
What
I
suggest
is
that
,
as
you
have
*NL*
no
house
of
your
own
,
you
do
not
marry
from
your
school
*NL*
friend
's
,
but
from
mine
.
It
would
be
more
proper
,
I
think
,
*NL*
since
I
am
,
as
you
say
,
the
person
nearest
related
to
you
in
*NL*
this
part
of
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
n't
see
why
you
sign
your
letter
in
such
a
new
and
*NL*
terribly
formal
way
?
Surely
you
care
a
bit
about
me
*NL*
still
!
--
Ever
your
affectionate
,
*NL*
*NL*
JUDE
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
had
jarred
on
him
even
more
than
the
signature
was
a
little
*NL*
sting
he
had
been
silent
on
--
the
phrase
``
married
relation
''
--
What
an
*NL*
idiot
it
made
him
seem
as
her
lover
!
If
Sue
had
written
that
in
*NL*
satire
,
he
could
hardly
forgive
her
;
if
in
suffering
--
ah
,
that
was
*NL*
another
thing
!
*NL*
*NL*
His
offer
of
his
lodging
must
have
commended
itself
to
Phillotson
*NL*
at
any
rate
,
for
the
schoolmaster
sent
him
a
line
of
warm
thanks
,
*NL*
accepting
the
convenience
.
Sue
also
thanked
him
.
Jude
immediately
*NL*
moved
into
more
commodious
quarters
,
as
much
to
escape
the
espionage
*NL*
of
the
suspicious
landlady
who
had
been
one
cause
of
Sue
's
unpleasant
*NL*
experience
as
for
the
sake
of
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Sue
wrote
to
tell
him
the
day
fixed
for
the
wedding
;
and
Jude
*NL*
decided
,
after
inquiry
,
that
she
should
come
into
residence
on
the
*NL*
following
Saturday
,
which
would
allow
of
a
ten
days
'
stay
in
the
city
*NL*
prior
to
the
ceremony
,
sufficiently
representing
a
nominal
residence
*NL*
of
fifteen
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
arrived
by
the
ten
o'clock
train
on
the
day
aforesaid
,
Jude
not
*NL*
going
to
meet
her
at
the
station
,
by
her
special
request
,
that
he
*NL*
should
not
lose
a
morning
's
work
and
pay
,
she
said
-LRB-
if
this
were
*NL*
her
true
reason
-RRB-
.
But
so
well
by
this
time
did
he
know
Sue
that
the
*NL*
remembrance
of
their
mutual
sensitiveness
at
emotional
crises
might
,
*NL*
he
thought
,
have
weighed
with
her
in
this
.
When
he
came
home
to
*NL*
dinner
she
had
taken
possession
of
her
apartment
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
lived
in
the
same
house
with
him
,
but
on
a
different
floor
,
and
*NL*
they
saw
each
other
little
,
an
occasional
supper
being
the
only
meal
*NL*
they
took
together
,
when
Sue
's
manner
was
something
like
that
of
a
*NL*
scared
child
.
What
she
felt
he
did
not
know
;
their
conversation
was
*NL*
mechanical
,
though
she
did
not
look
pale
or
ill
.
Phillotson
came
*NL*
frequently
,
but
mostly
when
Jude
was
absent
.
On
the
morning
of
the
*NL*
wedding
,
when
Jude
had
given
himself
a
holiday
,
Sue
and
her
cousin
*NL*
had
breakfast
together
for
the
first
and
last
time
during
this
*NL*
curious
interval
;
in
his
room
--
the
parlour
--
which
he
had
hired
for
*NL*
the
period
of
Sue
's
residence
.
Seeing
,
as
women
do
,
how
helpless
he
*NL*
was
in
making
the
place
comfortable
,
she
bustled
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
,
Jude
?
''
she
said
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
leaning
with
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
his
chin
on
his
*NL*
hands
,
looking
into
a
futurity
which
seemed
to
be
sketched
out
on
the
*NL*
tablecloth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
nothing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
`
father
'
,
you
know
.
That
's
what
they
call
the
man
who
gives
*NL*
you
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
could
have
said
``
Phillotson
's
age
entitles
him
to
be
called
*NL*
that
!
''
But
he
would
not
annoy
her
by
such
a
cheap
retort
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
talked
incessantly
,
as
if
she
dreaded
his
indulgence
in
*NL*
reflection
,
and
before
the
meal
was
over
both
he
and
she
wished
they
*NL*
had
not
put
such
confidence
in
their
new
view
of
things
,
and
had
*NL*
taken
breakfast
apart
.
What
oppressed
Jude
was
the
thought
that
,
*NL*
having
done
a
wrong
thing
of
this
sort
himself
,
he
was
aiding
and
*NL*
abetting
the
woman
he
loved
in
doing
a
like
wrong
thing
,
instead
of
*NL*
imploring
and
warning
her
against
it
.
It
was
on
his
tongue
to
say
,
*NL*
``
You
have
quite
made
up
your
mind
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
breakfast
they
went
out
on
an
errand
together
moved
by
a
mutual
*NL*
thought
that
it
was
the
last
opportunity
they
would
have
of
indulging
*NL*
in
unceremonious
companionship
.
By
the
irony
of
fate
,
and
the
*NL*
curious
trick
in
Sue
's
nature
of
tempting
Providence
at
critical
*NL*
times
,
she
took
his
arm
as
they
walked
through
the
muddy
street
--
a
*NL*
thing
she
had
never
done
before
in
her
life
--
and
on
turning
the
*NL*
corner
they
found
themselves
close
to
a
grey
perpendicular
church
*NL*
with
a
low-pitched
roof
--
the
church
of
St.
Thomas
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
church
,
''
said
Jude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
I
am
going
to
be
married
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
!
''
she
exclaimed
with
curiosity
.
``
How
I
should
like
to
go
in
*NL*
and
see
what
the
spot
is
like
where
I
am
so
soon
to
kneel
and
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
he
said
to
himself
,
``
She
does
not
realize
what
marriage
means
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
passively
acquiesced
in
her
wish
to
go
in
,
and
they
entered
by
*NL*
the
western
door
.
The
only
person
inside
the
gloomy
building
was
*NL*
a
charwoman
cleaning
.
Sue
still
held
Jude
's
arm
,
almost
as
if
she
*NL*
loved
him
.
Cruelly
sweet
,
indeed
,
she
had
been
to
him
that
morning
;
*NL*
but
his
thoughts
of
a
penance
in
store
for
her
were
tempered
by
an
*NL*
ache
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
...
I
can
find
no
way
*NL*
How
a
blow
should
fall
,
such
as
falls
on
men
,
*NL*
Nor
prove
too
much
for
your
womanhood
!
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
They
strolled
undemonstratively
up
the
nave
towards
the
altar
*NL*
railing
,
which
they
stood
against
in
silence
,
turning
then
and
*NL*
walking
down
the
nave
again
,
her
hand
still
on
his
arm
,
precisely
*NL*
like
a
couple
just
married
.
The
too
suggestive
incident
,
entirely
*NL*
of
her
making
,
nearly
broke
down
Jude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
to
do
things
like
this
,
''
she
said
in
the
delicate
voice
of
an
*NL*
epicure
in
emotions
,
which
left
no
doubt
that
she
spoke
the
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
you
do
!
''
said
Jude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
interesting
,
because
they
have
probably
never
been
done
*NL*
before
.
I
shall
walk
down
the
church
like
this
with
my
husband
in
*NL*
about
two
hours
,
sha
n't
I
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
doubt
you
will
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
it
like
this
when
you
were
married
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
God
,
Sue
--
do
n't
be
so
awfully
merciless
!
...
There
,
dear
one
,
*NL*
I
did
n't
mean
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
--
you
are
vexed
!
''
she
said
regretfully
,
as
she
blinked
away
an
*NL*
access
of
eye
moisture
.
``
And
I
promised
never
to
vex
you
!
...
I
*NL*
suppose
I
ought
not
to
have
asked
you
to
bring
me
in
here
.
Oh
,
I
*NL*
ought
n't
!
I
see
it
now
.
My
curiosity
to
hunt
up
a
new
sensation
*NL*
always
leads
me
into
these
scrapes
.
Forgive
me
!
...
You
will
,
wo
n't
*NL*
you
,
Jude
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
appeal
was
so
remorseful
that
Jude
's
eyes
were
even
wetter
than
*NL*
hers
as
he
pressed
her
hand
for
Yes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
we
'll
hurry
away
,
and
I
wo
n't
do
it
any
more
!
''
she
continued
*NL*
humbly
;
and
they
came
out
of
the
building
,
Sue
intending
to
go
*NL*
on
to
the
station
to
meet
Phillotson
.
But
the
first
person
they
*NL*
encountered
on
entering
the
main
street
was
the
schoolmaster
himself
,
*NL*
whose
train
had
arrived
sooner
than
Sue
expected
.
There
was
nothing
*NL*
really
to
demur
to
in
her
leaning
on
Jude
's
arm
;
but
she
withdrew
her
*NL*
hand
,
and
Jude
thought
that
Phillotson
had
looked
surprised
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
been
doing
such
a
funny
thing
!
''
said
she
,
smiling
candidly
.
*NL*
``
We
've
been
to
the
church
,
rehearsing
as
it
were
.
Have
n't
we
,
Jude
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
?
''
said
Phillotson
curiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
inwardly
deplored
what
he
thought
to
be
unnecessary
frankness
;
*NL*
but
she
had
gone
too
far
not
to
explain
all
,
which
she
accordingly
*NL*
did
,
telling
him
how
they
had
marched
up
to
the
altar
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seeing
how
puzzled
Phillotson
seemed
,
Jude
said
as
cheerfully
as
he
*NL*
could
,
``
I
am
going
to
buy
her
another
little
present
.
Will
you
both
*NL*
come
to
the
shop
with
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Sue
,
``
I
'll
go
on
to
the
house
with
him
''
;
and
requesting
*NL*
her
lover
not
to
be
a
long
time
she
departed
with
the
schoolmaster
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
soon
joined
them
at
his
rooms
,
and
shortly
after
they
prepared
*NL*
for
the
ceremony
.
Phillotson
's
hair
was
brushed
to
a
painful
*NL*
extent
,
and
his
shirt
collar
appeared
stiffer
than
it
had
been
for
*NL*
the
previous
twenty
years
.
Beyond
this
he
looked
dignified
and
*NL*
thoughtful
,
and
altogether
a
man
of
whom
it
was
not
unsafe
to
predict
*NL*
that
he
would
make
a
kind
and
considerate
husband
.
That
he
adored
*NL*
Sue
was
obvious
;
and
she
could
almost
be
seen
to
feel
that
she
was
*NL*
undeserving
his
adoration
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
the
distance
was
so
short
he
had
hired
a
fly
from
the
Red
*NL*
Lion
,
and
six
or
seven
women
and
children
had
gathered
by
the
door
*NL*
when
they
came
out
.
The
schoolmaster
and
Sue
were
unknown
,
though
*NL*
Jude
was
getting
to
be
recognized
as
a
citizen
;
and
the
couple
were
*NL*
judged
to
be
some
relations
of
his
from
a
distance
,
nobody
supposing
*NL*
Sue
to
have
been
a
recent
pupil
at
the
training
school
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
carriage
Jude
took
from
his
pocket
his
extra
little
*NL*
wedding-present
,
which
turned
out
to
be
two
or
three
yards
of
white
*NL*
tulle
,
which
he
threw
over
her
bonnet
and
all
,
as
a
veil
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
looks
so
odd
over
a
bonnet
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
'll
take
the
bonnet
*NL*
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
--
let
it
stay
,
''
said
Phillotson
.
And
she
obeyed
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
had
passed
up
the
church
and
were
standing
in
their
places
*NL*
Jude
found
that
the
antecedent
visit
had
certainly
taken
off
the
edge
*NL*
of
this
performance
,
but
by
the
time
they
were
half-way
on
with
the
*NL*
service
he
wished
from
his
heart
that
he
had
not
undertaken
the
*NL*
business
of
giving
her
away
.
How
could
Sue
have
had
the
temerity
to
*NL*
ask
him
to
do
it
--
a
cruelty
possibly
to
herself
as
well
as
to
him
?
*NL*
Women
were
different
from
men
in
such
matters
.
Was
it
that
they
*NL*
were
,
instead
of
more
sensitive
,
as
reputed
,
more
callous
,
and
less
*NL*
romantic
;
or
were
they
more
heroic
?
Or
was
Sue
simply
so
perverse
*NL*
that
she
wilfully
gave
herself
and
him
pain
for
the
odd
and
mournful
*NL*
luxury
of
practising
long-suffering
in
her
own
person
,
and
of
being
*NL*
touched
with
tender
pity
for
him
at
having
made
him
practise
it
?
He
*NL*
could
perceive
that
her
face
was
nervously
set
,
and
when
they
reached
*NL*
the
trying
ordeal
of
Jude
giving
her
to
Phillotson
she
could
hardly
*NL*
command
herself
;
rather
,
however
,
as
it
seemed
,
from
her
knowledge
of
*NL*
what
her
cousin
must
feel
,
whom
she
need
not
have
had
there
at
all
,
*NL*
than
from
self-consideration
.
Possibly
she
would
go
on
inflicting
*NL*
such
pains
again
and
again
,
and
grieving
for
the
sufferer
again
and
*NL*
again
,
in
all
her
colossal
inconsistency
.
*NL*
*NL*
Phillotson
seemed
not
to
notice
,
to
be
surrounded
by
a
mist
which
*NL*
prevented
his
seeing
the
emotions
of
others
.
As
soon
as
they
had
*NL*
signed
their
names
and
come
away
,
and
the
suspense
was
over
,
Jude
*NL*
felt
relieved
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
meal
at
his
lodging
was
a
very
simple
affair
,
and
at
two
o'clock
*NL*
they
went
off
.
In
crossing
the
pavement
to
the
fly
she
looked
back
;
*NL*
and
there
was
a
frightened
light
in
her
eyes
.
Could
it
be
that
Sue
*NL*
had
acted
with
such
unusual
foolishness
as
to
plunge
into
she
knew
*NL*
not
what
for
the
sake
of
asserting
her
independence
of
him
,
of
*NL*
retaliating
on
him
for
his
secrecy
?
Perhaps
Sue
was
thus
venturesome
*NL*
with
men
because
she
was
childishly
ignorant
of
that
side
of
their
*NL*
natures
which
wore
out
women
's
hearts
and
lives
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
her
foot
was
on
the
carriage-step
she
turned
round
,
saying
that
*NL*
she
had
forgotten
something
.
Jude
and
the
landlady
offered
to
get
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
said
,
running
back
.
``
It
is
my
handkerchief
.
I
know
where
*NL*
I
left
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
followed
her
back
.
She
had
found
it
,
and
came
holding
it
in
her
*NL*
hand
.
She
looked
into
his
eyes
with
her
own
tearful
ones
,
and
her
*NL*
lips
suddenly
parted
as
if
she
were
going
to
avow
something
.
But
she
*NL*
went
on
;
and
whatever
she
had
meant
to
say
remained
unspoken
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
VIII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
wondered
if
she
had
really
left
her
handkerchief
behind
;
or
*NL*
whether
it
were
that
she
had
miserably
wished
to
tell
him
of
a
love
*NL*
that
at
the
last
moment
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
express
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
stay
in
his
silent
lodging
when
they
were
gone
,
and
*NL*
fearing
that
he
might
be
tempted
to
drown
his
misery
in
alcohol
he
*NL*
went
upstairs
,
changed
his
dark
clothes
for
his
white
,
his
thin
boots
*NL*
for
his
thick
,
and
proceeded
to
his
customary
work
for
the
afternoon
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
in
the
cathedral
he
seemed
to
hear
a
voice
behind
him
,
and
to
*NL*
be
possessed
with
an
idea
that
she
would
come
back
.
She
could
not
*NL*
possibly
go
home
with
Phillotson
,
he
fancied
.
The
feeling
grew
and
*NL*
stirred
.
The
moment
that
the
clock
struck
the
last
of
his
working
*NL*
hours
he
threw
down
his
tools
and
rushed
homeward
.
``
Has
anybody
been
*NL*
for
me
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nobody
had
been
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
could
claim
the
downstairs
sitting-room
till
twelve
o'clock
*NL*
that
night
he
sat
in
it
all
the
evening
;
and
even
when
the
clock
had
*NL*
struck
eleven
,
and
the
family
had
retired
,
he
could
not
shake
off
*NL*
the
feeling
that
she
would
come
back
and
sleep
in
the
little
room
*NL*
adjoining
his
own
in
which
she
had
slept
so
many
previous
days
.
Her
*NL*
actions
were
always
unpredictable
:
why
should
she
not
come
?
Gladly
*NL*
would
he
have
compounded
for
the
denial
of
her
as
a
sweetheart
and
*NL*
wife
by
having
her
live
thus
as
a
fellow-lodger
and
friend
,
even
on
*NL*
the
most
distant
terms
.
His
supper
still
remained
spread
,
and
going
*NL*
to
the
front
door
,
and
softly
setting
it
open
,
he
returned
to
the
*NL*
room
and
sat
as
watchers
sit
on
Old-Midsummer
eves
,
expecting
the
*NL*
phantom
of
the
Beloved
.
But
she
did
not
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
indulged
in
this
wild
hope
he
went
upstairs
,
and
looked
out
of
*NL*
the
window
,
and
pictured
her
through
the
evening
journey
to
London
,
*NL*
whither
she
and
Phillotson
had
gone
for
their
holiday
;
their
rattling
*NL*
along
through
the
damp
night
to
their
hotel
,
under
the
same
sky
of
*NL*
ribbed
cloud
as
that
he
beheld
,
through
which
the
moon
showed
its
*NL*
position
rather
than
its
shape
,
and
one
or
two
of
the
larger
stars
*NL*
made
themselves
visible
as
faint
nebulae
only
.
It
was
a
new
*NL*
beginning
of
Sue
's
history
.
He
projected
his
mind
into
the
future
,
*NL*
and
saw
her
with
children
more
or
less
in
her
own
likeness
around
*NL*
her
.
But
the
consolation
of
regarding
them
as
a
continuation
of
*NL*
her
identity
was
denied
to
him
,
as
to
all
such
dreamers
,
by
the
*NL*
wilfulness
of
Nature
in
not
allowing
issue
from
one
parent
alone
.
*NL*
Every
desired
renewal
of
an
existence
is
debased
by
being
half
alloy
.
*NL*
``
If
at
the
estrangement
or
death
of
my
lost
love
,
I
could
go
and
see
*NL*
her
child
--
hers
solely
--
there
would
be
comfort
in
it
!
''
said
Jude
.
*NL*
And
then
he
again
uneasily
saw
,
as
he
had
latterly
seen
with
more
and
*NL*
more
frequency
,
the
scorn
of
Nature
for
man
's
finer
emotions
,
and
her
*NL*
lack
of
interest
in
his
aspirations
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
oppressive
strength
of
his
affection
for
Sue
showed
itself
on
*NL*
the
morrow
and
following
days
yet
more
clearly
.
He
could
no
longer
*NL*
endure
the
light
of
the
Melchester
lamps
;
the
sunshine
was
as
drab
*NL*
paint
,
and
the
blue
sky
as
zinc
.
Then
he
received
news
that
his
old
*NL*
aunt
was
dangerously
ill
at
Marygreen
,
which
intelligence
almost
*NL*
coincided
with
a
letter
from
his
former
employer
at
Christminster
,
*NL*
who
offered
him
permanent
work
of
a
good
class
if
he
would
come
back
.
*NL*
The
letters
were
almost
a
relief
to
him
.
He
started
to
visit
Aunt
*NL*
Drusilla
,
and
resolved
to
go
onward
to
Christminster
to
see
what
*NL*
worth
there
might
be
in
the
builder
's
offer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
found
his
aunt
even
worse
than
the
communication
from
the
Widow
*NL*
Edlin
had
led
him
to
expect
.
There
was
every
possibility
of
her
*NL*
lingering
on
for
weeks
or
months
,
though
little
likelihood
.
He
wrote
*NL*
to
Sue
informing
her
of
the
state
of
her
aunt
,
and
suggesting
that
*NL*
she
might
like
to
see
her
aged
relative
alive
.
He
would
meet
her
at
*NL*
Alfredston
Road
,
the
following
evening
,
Monday
,
on
his
way
back
from
*NL*
Christminster
,
if
she
could
come
by
the
up-train
which
crossed
his
*NL*
down-train
at
that
station
.
Next
morning
,
according
,
he
went
on
to
*NL*
Christminster
,
intending
to
return
to
Alfredston
soon
enough
to
keep
*NL*
the
suggested
appointment
with
Sue
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
city
of
learning
wore
an
estranged
look
,
and
he
had
lost
all
*NL*
feeling
for
its
associations
.
Yet
as
the
sun
made
vivid
lights
*NL*
and
shades
of
the
mullioned
architecture
of
the
facades
,
and
drew
*NL*
patterns
of
the
crinkled
battlements
on
the
young
turf
of
the
*NL*
quadrangles
,
Jude
thought
he
had
never
seen
the
place
look
more
*NL*
beautiful
.
He
came
to
the
street
in
which
he
had
first
beheld
Sue
.
*NL*
The
chair
she
had
occupied
when
,
leaning
over
her
ecclesiastical
*NL*
scrolls
,
a
hog-hair
brush
in
her
hand
,
her
girlish
figure
had
*NL*
arrested
the
gaze
of
his
inquiring
eyes
,
stood
precisely
in
its
*NL*
former
spot
,
empty
.
It
was
as
if
she
were
dead
,
and
nobody
had
been
*NL*
found
capable
of
succeeding
her
in
that
artistic
pursuit
.
Hers
was
*NL*
now
the
city
phantom
,
while
those
of
the
intellectual
and
devotional
*NL*
worthies
who
had
once
moved
him
to
emotion
were
no
longer
able
to
*NL*
assert
their
presence
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
here
he
was
;
and
in
fulfilment
of
his
intention
he
went
on
*NL*
to
his
former
lodging
in
``
Beersheba
,
''
near
the
ritualistic
church
of
*NL*
St.
Silas
.
The
old
landlady
who
opened
the
door
seemed
glad
to
see
*NL*
him
again
,
and
bringing
some
lunch
informed
him
that
the
builder
who
*NL*
had
employed
him
had
called
to
inquire
his
address
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
went
on
to
the
stone-yard
where
he
had
worked
.
But
the
old
*NL*
sheds
and
bankers
were
distasteful
to
him
;
he
felt
it
impossible
to
*NL*
engage
himself
to
return
and
stay
in
this
place
of
vanished
dreams
.
*NL*
He
longed
for
the
hour
of
the
homeward
train
to
Alfredston
,
where
he
*NL*
might
probably
meet
Sue
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
for
one
ghastly
half-hour
of
depression
caused
by
these
scenes
,
*NL*
there
returned
upon
him
that
feeling
which
had
been
his
undoing
more
*NL*
than
once
--
that
he
was
not
worth
the
trouble
of
being
taken
care
of
*NL*
either
by
himself
or
others
;
and
during
this
half-hour
he
met
Tinker
*NL*
Taylor
,
the
bankrupt
ecclesiastical
ironmonger
,
at
Fourways
,
who
*NL*
proposed
that
they
should
adjourn
to
a
bar
and
drink
together
.
*NL*
They
walked
along
the
street
till
they
stood
before
one
of
the
*NL*
great
palpitating
centres
of
Christminster
life
,
the
inn
wherein
he
*NL*
formerly
had
responded
to
the
challenge
to
rehearse
the
Creed
in
*NL*
Latin
--
now
a
popular
tavern
with
a
spacious
and
inviting
entrance
,
*NL*
which
gave
admittance
to
a
bar
that
had
been
entirely
renovated
and
*NL*
refitted
in
modern
style
since
Jude
's
residence
here
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tinker
Taylor
drank
off
his
glass
and
departed
,
saying
it
was
too
*NL*
stylish
a
place
now
for
him
to
feel
at
home
in
unless
he
was
drunker
*NL*
than
he
had
money
to
be
just
then
.
Jude
was
longer
finishing
his
,
*NL*
and
stood
abstractedly
silent
in
the
,
for
the
minute
,
almost
empty
*NL*
place
.
The
bar
had
been
gutted
and
newly
arranged
throughout
,
*NL*
mahogany
fixtures
having
taken
the
place
of
the
old
painted
*NL*
ones
,
while
at
the
back
of
the
standing-space
there
were
stuffed
*NL*
sofa-benches
.
The
room
was
divided
into
compartments
in
the
approved
*NL*
manner
,
between
which
were
screens
of
ground
glass
in
mahogany
*NL*
framing
,
to
prevent
topers
in
one
compartment
being
put
to
the
blush
*NL*
by
the
recognitions
of
those
in
the
next
.
On
the
inside
of
the
*NL*
counter
two
barmaids
leant
over
the
white-handled
beer-engines
,
*NL*
and
the
row
of
little
silvered
taps
inside
,
dripping
into
a
pewter
*NL*
trough
.
*NL*
*NL*
Feeling
tired
,
and
having
nothing
more
to
do
till
the
train
left
,
*NL*
Jude
sat
down
on
one
of
the
sofas
.
At
the
back
of
the
barmaids
rose
*NL*
bevel-edged
mirrors
,
with
glass
shelves
running
along
their
front
,
*NL*
on
which
stood
precious
liquids
that
Jude
did
not
know
the
name
*NL*
of
,
in
bottles
of
topaz
,
sapphire
,
ruby
and
amethyst
.
The
moment
*NL*
was
enlivened
by
the
entrance
of
some
customers
into
the
next
*NL*
compartment
,
and
the
starting
of
the
mechanical
tell-tale
of
monies
*NL*
received
,
which
emitted
a
ting-ting
every
time
a
coin
was
put
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
barmaid
attending
to
this
compartment
was
invisible
to
Jude
's
*NL*
direct
glance
,
though
a
reflection
of
her
back
in
the
glass
behind
*NL*
her
was
occasionally
caught
by
his
eyes
.
He
had
only
observed
this
*NL*
listlessly
,
when
she
turned
her
face
for
a
moment
to
the
glass
to
set
*NL*
her
hair
tidy
.
Then
he
was
amazed
to
discover
that
the
face
was
*NL*
Arabella
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
she
had
come
on
to
his
compartment
she
would
have
seen
him
.
*NL*
But
she
did
not
,
this
being
presided
over
by
the
maiden
on
the
other
*NL*
side
.
Abby
was
in
a
black
gown
,
with
white
linen
cuffs
and
a
broad
*NL*
white
collar
,
and
her
figure
,
more
developed
than
formerly
,
was
*NL*
accentuated
by
a
bunch
of
daffodils
that
she
wore
on
her
left
bosom
.
*NL*
In
the
compartment
she
served
stood
an
electro-plated
fountain
of
*NL*
water
over
a
spirit-lamp
,
whose
blue
flame
sent
a
steam
from
the
top
,
*NL*
all
this
being
visible
to
him
only
in
the
mirror
behind
her
;
which
*NL*
also
reflected
the
faces
of
the
men
she
was
attending
to
--
one
of
them
*NL*
a
handsome
,
dissipated
young
fellow
,
possibly
an
undergraduate
,
who
*NL*
had
been
relating
to
her
an
experience
of
some
humorous
sort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Mr.
Cockman
,
now
!
How
can
you
tell
such
a
tale
to
me
in
my
*NL*
innocence
!
''
she
cried
gaily
.
``
Mr.
Cockman
,
what
do
you
use
to
make
*NL*
your
moustache
curl
so
beautiful
?
''
As
the
young
man
was
clean
shaven
,
*NL*
the
retort
provoked
a
laugh
at
his
expense
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
!
''
said
he
,
``
I
'll
have
a
curacao
;
and
a
light
,
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
served
the
liqueur
from
one
of
the
lovely
bottles
and
striking
*NL*
a
match
held
it
to
his
cigarette
with
ministering
archness
while
he
*NL*
whiffed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
have
you
heard
from
your
husband
lately
,
my
dear
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
sound
,
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
left
him
in
Australia
;
and
I
suppose
he
's
there
still
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
's
eyes
grew
rounder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
made
you
part
from
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
ask
questions
,
and
you
wo
n't
hear
lies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
then
,
give
me
my
change
,
which
you
've
been
keeping
from
me
for
*NL*
the
last
quarter
of
an
hour
;
and
I
'll
romantically
vanish
up
the
*NL*
street
of
this
picturesque
city
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
handed
the
change
over
the
counter
,
in
taking
which
he
caught
her
*NL*
fingers
and
held
them
.
There
was
a
slight
struggle
and
titter
,
and
*NL*
he
bade
her
good-bye
and
left
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
had
looked
on
with
the
eye
of
a
dazed
philosopher
.
It
was
*NL*
extraordinary
how
far
removed
from
his
life
Arabella
now
seemed
to
*NL*
be
.
He
could
not
realize
their
nominal
closeness
.
And
,
this
being
*NL*
the
case
,
in
his
present
frame
of
mind
he
was
indifferent
to
the
fact
*NL*
that
Arabella
was
his
wife
indeed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
compartment
that
she
served
emptied
itself
of
visitors
,
and
*NL*
after
a
brief
thought
he
entered
it
,
and
went
forward
to
the
counter
.
*NL*
Arabella
did
not
recognize
him
for
a
moment
.
Then
their
glances
met
.
*NL*
She
started
;
till
a
humorous
impudence
sparkled
in
her
eyes
,
and
she
*NL*
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'm
blest
!
I
thought
you
were
underground
years
ago
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
heard
anything
of
you
,
or
I
do
n't
know
that
I
should
*NL*
have
come
here
.
But
never
mind
!
What
shall
I
treat
you
to
this
*NL*
afternoon
?
A
Scotch
and
soda
?
Come
,
anything
that
the
house
will
*NL*
afford
,
for
old
acquaintance
'
sake
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks
,
Arabella
,
''
said
Jude
without
a
smile
.
``
But
I
do
n't
want
*NL*
anything
more
than
I
've
had
.
''
The
fact
was
that
her
unexpected
*NL*
presence
there
had
destroyed
at
a
stroke
his
momentary
taste
for
*NL*
strong
liquor
as
completely
as
if
it
had
whisked
him
back
to
his
*NL*
milk-fed
infancy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
pity
,
now
you
could
get
it
for
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
long
have
you
been
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
six
weeks
.
I
returned
from
Sydney
three
months
ago
.
I
always
*NL*
liked
this
business
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
you
came
to
this
place
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
as
I
say
,
I
thought
you
were
gone
to
glory
,
and
being
in
*NL*
London
I
saw
the
situation
in
an
advertisement
.
Nobody
was
likely
to
*NL*
know
me
here
,
even
if
I
had
minded
,
for
I
was
never
in
Christminster
*NL*
in
my
growing
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
you
return
from
Australia
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
had
my
reasons
...
Then
you
are
not
a
don
yet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
even
a
reverend
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
so
much
as
a
rather
reverend
dissenting
gentleman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
as
I
was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
--
you
look
so
.
''
She
idly
allowed
her
fingers
to
rest
on
the
*NL*
pull
of
the
beer-engine
as
she
inspected
him
critically
.
He
observed
*NL*
that
her
hands
were
smaller
and
whiter
than
when
he
had
lived
with
*NL*
her
,
and
that
on
the
hand
which
pulled
the
engine
she
wore
an
*NL*
ornamental
ring
set
with
what
seemed
to
be
real
sapphires
--
which
they
*NL*
were
,
indeed
,
and
were
much
admired
as
such
by
the
young
men
who
*NL*
frequented
the
bar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
pass
as
having
a
living
husband
,
''
he
continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
I
thought
it
might
be
awkward
if
I
called
myself
a
widow
,
as
I
*NL*
should
have
liked
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
.
I
am
known
here
a
little
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
mean
on
that
account
--
for
as
I
said
I
did
n't
expect
you
.
*NL*
It
was
for
other
reasons
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
were
they
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
care
to
go
into
them
,
''
she
replied
evasively
.
``
I
make
a
*NL*
very
good
living
,
and
I
do
n't
know
that
I
want
your
company
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
a
chappie
with
no
chin
,
and
a
moustache
like
a
lady
's
eyebrow
,
*NL*
came
and
asked
for
a
curiously
compounded
drink
,
and
Arabella
was
*NL*
obliged
to
go
and
attend
to
him
.
``
We
ca
n't
talk
here
,
''
she
said
,
*NL*
stepping
back
a
moment
.
``
Ca
n't
you
wait
till
nine
?
Say
yes
,
and
*NL*
do
n't
be
a
fool
.
I
can
get
off
duty
two
hours
sooner
than
usual
,
if
*NL*
I
ask
.
I
am
not
living
in
the
house
at
present
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
reflected
and
said
gloomily
,
``
I
'll
come
back
.
I
suppose
we
'd
*NL*
better
arrange
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
bother
arranging
!
I
'm
not
going
to
arrange
anything
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
must
know
a
thing
or
two
;
and
,
as
you
say
,
we
ca
n't
talk
here
.
*NL*
Very
well
;
I
'll
call
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Depositing
his
unemptied
glass
he
went
out
and
walked
up
and
down
the
*NL*
street
.
Here
was
a
rude
flounce
into
the
pellucid
sentimentality
of
*NL*
his
sad
attachment
to
Sue
.
Though
Arabella
's
word
was
absolutely
*NL*
untrustworthy
,
he
thought
there
might
be
some
truth
in
her
*NL*
implication
that
she
had
not
wished
to
disturb
him
,
and
had
really
*NL*
supposed
him
dead
.
However
,
there
was
only
one
thing
now
to
be
done
,
*NL*
and
that
was
to
play
a
straightforward
part
,
the
law
being
the
law
,
*NL*
and
the
woman
between
whom
and
himself
there
was
no
more
unity
than
*NL*
between
east
and
west
,
being
in
the
eye
of
the
Church
one
person
with
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
to
meet
Arabella
here
,
it
was
impossible
to
meet
Sue
at
*NL*
Alfredston
as
he
had
promised
.
At
every
thought
of
this
a
pang
*NL*
had
gone
through
him
;
but
the
conjuncture
could
not
be
helped
.
*NL*
Arabella
was
perhaps
an
intended
intervention
to
punish
him
for
his
*NL*
unauthorized
love
.
Passing
the
evening
,
therefore
,
in
a
desultory
*NL*
waiting
about
the
town
wherein
he
avoided
the
precincts
of
every
*NL*
cloister
and
hall
,
because
he
could
not
bear
to
behold
them
,
he
*NL*
repaired
to
the
tavern
bar
while
the
hundred
and
one
strokes
were
*NL*
resounding
from
the
Great
Bell
of
Cardinal
College
,
a
coincidence
*NL*
which
seemed
to
him
gratuitous
irony
.
The
inn
was
now
brilliantly
*NL*
lighted
up
,
and
the
scene
was
altogether
more
brisk
and
gay
.
The
*NL*
faces
of
the
barmaidens
had
risen
in
colour
,
each
having
a
pink
*NL*
flush
on
her
cheek
;
their
manners
were
still
more
vivacious
than
*NL*
before
--
more
abandoned
,
more
excited
,
more
sensuous
,
and
they
*NL*
expressed
their
sentiments
and
desires
less
euphemistically
,
laughing
*NL*
in
a
lackadaisical
tone
,
without
reserve
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bar
had
been
crowded
with
men
of
all
sorts
during
the
previous
*NL*
hour
,
and
he
had
heard
from
without
the
hubbub
of
their
voices
;
but
*NL*
the
customers
were
fewer
at
last
.
He
nodded
to
Arabella
,
and
told
*NL*
her
that
she
would
find
him
outside
the
door
when
she
came
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
must
have
something
with
me
first
,
''
she
said
with
great
*NL*
good
humour
.
``
Just
an
early
night-cap
:
I
always
do
.
Then
you
can
*NL*
go
out
and
wait
a
minute
,
as
it
is
best
we
should
not
be
seen
going
*NL*
together
.
''
She
drew
a
couple
of
liqueur
glasses
of
brandy
;
and
*NL*
though
she
had
evidently
,
from
her
countenance
,
already
taken
in
*NL*
enough
alcohol
either
by
drinking
or
,
more
probably
,
from
the
*NL*
atmosphere
she
had
breathed
for
so
many
hours
,
she
finished
hers
*NL*
quickly
.
He
also
drank
his
,
and
went
outside
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
few
minutes
she
came
,
in
a
thick
jacket
and
a
hat
with
a
black
*NL*
feather
.
``
I
live
quite
near
,
''
she
said
,
taking
his
arm
,
``
and
can
let
*NL*
myself
in
by
a
latch-key
at
any
time
.
What
arrangement
do
you
want
*NL*
to
come
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
none
in
particular
,
''
he
answered
,
thoroughly
sick
and
tired
,
his
*NL*
thoughts
again
reverting
to
Alfredston
,
and
the
train
he
did
not
go
*NL*
by
;
the
probable
disappointment
of
Sue
that
he
was
not
there
when
*NL*
she
arrived
,
and
the
missed
pleasure
of
her
company
on
the
long
and
*NL*
lonely
climb
by
starlight
up
the
hills
to
Marygreen
.
``
I
ought
to
*NL*
have
gone
back
really
!
My
aunt
is
on
her
deathbed
,
I
fear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
go
over
with
you
to-morrow
morning
.
I
think
I
could
get
a
day
*NL*
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
something
particularly
uncongenial
in
the
idea
of
Arabella
,
*NL*
who
had
no
more
sympathy
than
a
tigress
with
his
relations
or
him
,
*NL*
coming
to
the
bedside
of
his
dying
aunt
,
and
meeting
Sue
.
Yet
he
*NL*
said
,
``
Of
course
,
if
you
'd
like
to
,
you
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
we
'll
consider
...
Now
,
until
we
have
come
to
some
*NL*
agreement
it
is
awkward
our
being
together
here
--
where
you
are
known
,
*NL*
and
I
am
getting
known
,
though
without
any
suspicion
that
I
have
*NL*
anything
to
do
with
you
.
As
we
are
going
towards
the
station
,
*NL*
suppose
we
take
the
nine-forty
train
to
Aldbrickham
?
We
shall
be
*NL*
there
in
little
more
than
half
an
hour
,
and
nobody
will
know
us
for
*NL*
one
night
,
and
we
shall
be
quite
free
to
act
as
we
choose
till
we
*NL*
have
made
up
our
minds
whether
we
'll
make
anything
public
or
not
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
wait
till
I
get
two
or
three
things
.
This
is
my
lodging
.
*NL*
Sometimes
when
late
I
sleep
at
the
hotel
where
I
am
engaged
,
so
*NL*
nobody
will
think
anything
of
my
staying
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
speedily
returned
,
and
they
went
on
to
the
railway
,
and
made
the
*NL*
half-hour
's
journey
to
Aldbrickham
,
where
they
entered
a
third-rate
*NL*
inn
near
the
station
in
time
for
a
late
supper
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IX
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
morrow
between
nine
and
half-past
they
were
journeying
back
*NL*
to
Christminster
,
the
only
two
occupants
of
a
compartment
in
a
*NL*
third-class
railway-carriage
.
Having
,
like
Jude
,
made
rather
a
*NL*
hasty
toilet
to
catch
the
train
,
Arabella
looked
a
little
frowsy
,
*NL*
and
her
face
was
very
far
from
possessing
the
animation
which
had
*NL*
characterized
it
at
the
bar
the
night
before
.
When
they
came
out
of
*NL*
the
station
she
found
that
she
still
had
half
an
hour
to
spare
before
*NL*
she
was
due
at
the
bar
.
They
walked
in
silence
a
little
way
out
of
*NL*
the
town
in
the
direction
of
Alfredston
.
Jude
looked
up
the
far
*NL*
highway
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
...
poor
feeble
me
!
''
he
murmured
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
the
very
road
by
which
I
came
into
Christminster
years
ago
*NL*
full
of
plans
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
whatever
the
road
is
I
think
my
time
is
nearly
up
,
as
I
have
*NL*
to
be
in
the
bar
by
eleven
o'clock
.
And
as
I
said
,
I
sha
n't
ask
for
*NL*
the
day
to
go
with
you
to
see
your
aunt
.
So
perhaps
we
had
better
*NL*
part
here
.
I
'd
sooner
not
walk
up
Chief
Street
with
you
,
since
we
've
*NL*
come
to
no
conclusion
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
.
But
you
said
when
we
were
getting
up
this
morning
that
*NL*
you
had
something
you
wished
to
tell
me
before
I
left
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
had
--
two
things
--
one
in
particular
.
But
you
would
n't
promise
*NL*
to
keep
it
a
secret
.
I
'll
tell
you
now
if
you
promise
?
As
an
honest
*NL*
woman
I
wish
you
to
know
it
...
It
was
what
I
began
telling
you
*NL*
in
the
night
--
about
that
gentleman
who
managed
the
Sydney
hotel
.
''
*NL*
Arabella
spoke
somewhat
hurriedly
for
her
.
``
You
'll
keep
it
close
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
yes
--
I
promise
!
''
said
Jude
impatiently
.
``
Of
course
I
do
n't
*NL*
want
to
reveal
your
secrets
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whenever
I
met
him
out
for
a
walk
,
he
used
to
say
that
he
was
much
*NL*
taken
with
my
looks
,
and
he
kept
pressing
me
to
marry
him
.
I
never
*NL*
thought
of
coming
back
to
England
again
;
and
being
out
there
in
*NL*
Australia
,
with
no
home
of
my
own
after
leaving
my
father
,
I
at
last
*NL*
agreed
,
and
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
--
marry
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Regularly
--
legally
--
in
church
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
And
lived
with
him
till
shortly
before
I
left
.
It
was
stupid
,
*NL*
I
know
;
but
I
did
!
There
,
now
I
've
told
you
.
Do
n't
round
upon
me
!
*NL*
He
talks
of
coming
back
to
England
,
poor
old
chap
.
But
if
he
does
,
*NL*
he
wo
n't
be
likely
to
find
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
stood
pale
and
fixed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
the
devil
did
n't
you
tell
me
last
,
night
!
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
I
did
n't
...
Wo
n't
you
make
it
up
with
me
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
in
talking
of
`
your
husband
'
to
the
bar
gentlemen
you
meant
him
,
*NL*
of
course
--
not
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
...
Come
,
do
n't
fuss
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
nothing
more
to
say
!
''
replied
Jude
.
``
I
have
nothing
at
all
*NL*
to
say
about
the
--
crime
--
you
've
confessed
to
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Crime
!
Pooh
.
They
do
n't
think
much
of
such
as
that
over
there
!
*NL*
Lots
of
'em
do
it
...
Well
,
if
you
take
it
like
that
I
shall
go
back
*NL*
to
him
!
He
was
very
fond
of
me
,
and
we
lived
honourable
enough
,
and
*NL*
as
respectable
as
any
married
couple
in
the
colony
!
How
did
I
know
*NL*
where
you
were
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
go
blaming
you
.
I
could
say
a
good
deal
;
but
perhaps
it
*NL*
would
be
misplaced
.
What
do
you
wish
me
to
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
.
There
was
one
thing
more
I
wanted
to
tell
you
;
but
I
fancy
*NL*
we
've
seen
enough
of
one
another
for
the
present
!
I
shall
think
over
*NL*
what
you
said
about
your
circumstances
,
and
let
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
they
parted
.
Jude
watched
her
disappear
in
the
direction
of
*NL*
the
hotel
,
and
entered
the
railway
station
close
by
.
Finding
that
*NL*
it
wanted
three-quarters
of
an
hour
of
the
time
at
which
he
could
*NL*
get
a
train
back
to
Alfredston
,
he
strolled
mechanically
into
the
*NL*
city
as
far
as
to
the
Fourways
,
where
he
stood
as
he
had
so
often
*NL*
stood
before
,
and
surveyed
Chief
Street
stretching
ahead
,
with
its
*NL*
college
after
college
,
in
picturesqueness
unrivalled
except
by
such
*NL*
Continental
vistas
as
the
Street
of
Palaces
in
Genoa
;
the
lines
*NL*
of
the
buildings
being
as
distinct
in
the
morning
air
as
in
an
*NL*
architectural
drawing
.
But
Jude
was
far
from
seeing
or
criticizing
*NL*
these
things
;
they
were
hidden
by
an
indescribable
consciousness
of
*NL*
Arabella
's
midnight
contiguity
,
a
sense
of
degradation
at
his
revived
*NL*
experiences
with
her
,
of
her
appearance
as
she
lay
asleep
at
dawn
,
*NL*
which
set
upon
his
motionless
face
a
look
as
of
one
accurst
.
If
he
*NL*
could
only
have
felt
resentment
towards
her
he
would
have
been
less
*NL*
unhappy
;
but
he
pitied
while
he
contemned
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
turned
and
retraced
his
steps
.
Drawing
again
towards
the
*NL*
station
he
started
at
hearing
his
name
pronounced
--
less
at
the
name
*NL*
than
at
the
voice
.
To
his
great
surprise
no
other
than
Sue
stood
*NL*
like
a
vision
before
him
--
her
look
bodeful
and
anxious
as
in
a
dream
,
*NL*
her
little
mouth
nervous
,
and
her
strained
eyes
speaking
reproachful
*NL*
inquiry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Jude
--
I
am
so
glad
--
to
meet
you
like
this
!
''
she
said
in
quick
,
*NL*
uneven
accents
not
far
from
a
sob
.
Then
she
flushed
as
she
observed
*NL*
his
thought
that
they
had
not
met
since
her
marriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
looked
away
from
each
other
to
hide
their
emotion
,
took
each
*NL*
other
's
hand
without
further
speech
,
and
went
on
together
awhile
,
*NL*
till
she
glanced
at
him
with
furtive
solicitude
.
``
I
arrived
at
*NL*
Alfredston
station
last
night
,
as
you
asked
me
to
,
and
there
was
*NL*
nobody
to
meet
me
!
But
I
reached
Marygreen
alone
,
and
they
told
me
*NL*
Aunt
was
a
trifle
better
.
I
sat
up
with
her
,
and
as
you
did
not
come
*NL*
all
night
I
was
frightened
about
you
--
I
thought
that
perhaps
,
when
*NL*
you
found
yourself
back
in
the
old
city
,
you
were
upset
at
--
at
*NL*
thinking
I
was
--
married
,
and
not
there
as
I
used
to
be
;
and
that
you
*NL*
had
nobody
to
speak
to
;
so
you
had
tried
to
drown
your
gloom
--
as
you
*NL*
did
at
that
former
time
when
you
were
disappointed
about
entering
as
*NL*
a
student
,
and
had
forgotten
your
promise
to
me
that
you
never
would
*NL*
again
.
And
this
,
I
thought
,
was
why
you
had
n't
come
to
meet
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
came
to
hunt
me
up
,
and
deliver
me
,
like
a
good
angel
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
I
would
come
by
the
morning
train
and
try
to
find
you
--
in
*NL*
case
--
in
case
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
think
of
my
promise
to
you
,
dear
,
continually
!
I
shall
never
*NL*
break
out
again
as
I
did
,
I
am
sure
.
I
may
have
been
doing
nothing
*NL*
better
,
but
I
was
not
doing
that
--
I
loathe
the
thought
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
your
staying
had
nothing
to
do
with
that
.
But
,
''
she
said
,
*NL*
the
faintest
pout
entering
into
her
tone
,
``
you
did
n't
come
back
last
*NL*
night
and
meet
me
,
as
you
engaged
to
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
--
I
am
sorry
to
say
.
I
had
an
appointment
at
nine
*NL*
o'clock
--
too
late
for
me
to
catch
the
train
that
would
have
met
*NL*
yours
,
or
to
get
home
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Looking
at
his
loved
one
as
she
appeared
to
him
now
,
in
his
tender
*NL*
thought
the
sweetest
and
most
disinterested
comrade
that
he
had
ever
*NL*
had
,
living
largely
in
vivid
imaginings
,
so
ethereal
a
creature
*NL*
that
her
spirit
could
be
seen
trembling
through
her
limbs
,
he
felt
*NL*
heartily
ashamed
of
his
earthliness
in
spending
the
hours
he
had
*NL*
spent
in
Arabella
's
company
.
There
was
something
rude
and
immoral
*NL*
in
thrusting
these
recent
facts
of
his
life
upon
the
mind
of
one
who
,
*NL*
to
him
,
was
so
uncarnate
as
to
seem
at
times
impossible
as
a
human
*NL*
wife
to
any
average
man
.
And
yet
she
was
Phillotson
's
.
How
she
had
*NL*
become
such
,
how
she
lived
as
such
,
passed
his
comprehension
as
he
*NL*
regarded
her
to-day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
go
back
with
me
?
''
he
said
.
``
There
's
a
train
just
now
.
I
*NL*
wonder
how
my
aunt
is
by
this
time
...
And
so
,
Sue
,
you
really
came
*NL*
on
my
account
all
this
way
!
At
what
an
early
time
you
must
have
*NL*
started
,
poor
thing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
Sitting
up
watching
alone
made
me
all
nerves
for
you
,
and
*NL*
instead
of
going
to
bed
when
it
got
light
I
started
.
And
now
you
*NL*
wo
n't
frighten
me
like
this
again
about
your
morals
for
nothing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
not
so
sure
that
she
had
been
frightened
about
his
morals
for
*NL*
nothing
.
He
released
her
hand
till
they
had
entered
the
train
,
--
it
*NL*
seemed
the
same
carriage
he
had
lately
got
out
of
with
another
--
where
*NL*
they
sat
down
side
by
side
,
Sue
between
him
and
the
window
.
He
*NL*
regarded
the
delicate
lines
of
her
profile
,
and
the
small
,
tight
,
*NL*
applelike
convexities
of
her
bodice
,
so
different
from
Arabella
's
*NL*
amplitudes
.
Though
she
knew
he
was
looking
at
her
she
did
not
turn
*NL*
to
him
,
but
kept
her
eyes
forward
,
as
if
afraid
that
by
meeting
his
*NL*
own
some
troublous
discussion
would
be
initiated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sue
--
you
are
married
now
,
you
know
,
like
me
;
and
yet
we
have
been
in
*NL*
such
a
hurry
that
we
have
not
said
a
word
about
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
no
necessity
,
''
she
quickly
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
well
--
perhaps
not
...
But
I
wish
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jude
--
do
n't
talk
about
ME

I
wish
you
would
n't

''
she
entreated
.
*NL*
``
It
distresses
me
,
rather
.
Forgive
my
saying
it
!
...
Where
did
you
*NL*
stay
last
night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
asked
the
question
in
perfect
innocence
,
to
change
the
topic
.
*NL*
He
knew
that
,
and
said
merely
,
``
At
an
inn
,
''
though
it
would
have
been
*NL*
a
relief
to
tell
her
of
his
meeting
with
an
unexpected
one
.
But
the
*NL*
latter
's
final
announcement
of
her
marriage
in
Australia
bewildered
*NL*
him
lest
what
he
might
say
should
do
his
ignorant
wife
an
injury
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
talk
proceeded
but
awkwardly
till
they
reached
Alfredston
.
*NL*
That
Sue
was
not
as
she
had
been
,
but
was
labelled
``
Phillotson
,
''
*NL*
paralyzed
Jude
whenever
he
wanted
to
commune
with
her
as
an
*NL*
individual
.
Yet
she
seemed
unaltered
--
he
could
not
say
why
.
*NL*
There
remained
the
five-mile
extra
journey
into
the
country
,
which
*NL*
it
was
just
as
easy
to
walk
as
to
drive
,
the
greater
part
of
it
being
*NL*
uphill
.
Jude
had
never
before
in
his
life
gone
that
road
with
Sue
,
*NL*
though
he
had
with
another
.
It
was
now
as
if
he
carried
a
bright
*NL*
light
which
temporarily
banished
the
shady
associations
of
the
*NL*
earlier
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sue
talked
;
but
Jude
noticed
that
she
still
kept
the
conversation
*NL*
from
herself
.
At
length
he
inquired
if
her
husband
were
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
yes
,
''
she
said
.
``
He
is
obliged
to
be
in
the
school
all
the
day
,
*NL*
or
he
would
have
come
with
me
.
He
is
so
good
and
kind
that
to
*NL*
accompany
me
he
would
have
dismissed
the
school
for
once
,
even
*NL*
against
his
principles
--
for
he
is
strongly
opposed
to
giving
casual
*NL*
holidays
--
only
I
would
n't
let
him
.
I
felt
it
would
be
better
to
come
*NL*
alone
.
Aunt
Drusilla
,
I
knew
,
was
so
very
eccentric
;
and
his
being
*NL*
almost
a
stranger
to
her
now
would
have
made
it
irksome
to
both
.
*NL*
Since
it
turns
out
that
she
is
hardly
conscious
I
am
glad
I
did
not
*NL*
ask
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
had
walked
moodily
while
this
praise
of
Phillotson
was
being
*NL*
expressed
.
``
Mr.
Phillotson
obliges
you
in
everything
,
as
he
ought
,
''
*NL*
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ought
to
be
a
happy
wife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
of
course
I
am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bride
,
I
might
almost
have
said
,
as
yet
.
It
is
not
so
many
weeks
*NL*
since
I
gave
you
to
him
,
and
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
know
!
I
know
!
''
There
was
something
in
her
face
which
belied
*NL*
her
late
assuring
words
,
so
strictly
proper
and
so
lifelessly
spoken
*NL*
that
they
might
have
been
taken
from
a
list
of
model
speeches
in
``
The
*NL*
Wife
's
Guide
to
Conduct
.
''
Jude
knew
the
quality
of
every
vibration
*NL*
in
Sue
's
voice
,
could
read
every
symptom
of
her
mental
condition
;
and
*NL*
he
was
convinced
that
she
was
unhappy
,
although
she
had
not
been
a
*NL*
month
married
.
But
her
rushing
away
thus
from
home
,
to
see
the
last
*NL*
of
a
relative
whom
she
had
hardly
known
in
her
life
,
proved
nothing
;
*NL*
for
Sue
naturally
did
such
things
as
those
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
have
my
good
wishes
now
as
always
,
Mrs.
Phillotson
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
reproached
him
by
a
glance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
you
are
not
Mrs.
Phillotson
,
''
murmured
Jude
.
``
You
are
dear
,
*NL*
free
Sue
Bridehead
,
only
you
do
n't
know
it
!
Wifedom
has
not
yet
*NL*
squashed
up
and
digested
you
in
its
vast
maw
as
an
atom
which
has
no
*NL*
further
individuality
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sue
put
on
a
look
of
being
offended
,
till
she
answered
,
``
Nor
has
*NL*
husbandom
you
,
so
far
as
I
can
see
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
has
!
''
he
said
,
shaking
his
head
sadly
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
reached
the
lone
cottage
under
the
firs
,
between
the
*NL*
Brown
House
and
Marygreen
,
in
which
Jude
and
Arabella
had
lived
and
*NL*
quarrelled
,
he
turned
to
look
at
it
.
A
squalid
family
lived
there
*NL*
now
.
He
could
not
help
saying
to
Sue
:
``
That
's
the
house
my
wife
and
*NL*
I
occupied
the
whole
of
the
time
we
lived
together
.
I
brought
her
*NL*
home
to
that
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
it
.
``
That
to
you
was
what
the
school-house
at
Shaston
*NL*
is
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
I
was
not
very
happy
there
as
you
are
in
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
closed
her
lips
in
retortive
silence
,
and
they
walked
some
way
*NL*
till
she
glanced
at
him
to
see
how
he
was
taking
it
.
``
Of
course
I
*NL*
may
have
exaggerated
your
happiness
--
one
never
knows
,
''
he
continued
*NL*
blandly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
think
that
,
Jude
,
for
a
moment
,
even
though
you
may
have
said
*NL*
it
to
sting
me
!
He
's
as
good
to
me
as
a
man
can
be
,
and
gives
me
*NL*
perfect
liberty
--
which
elderly
husbands
do
n't
do
in
general
...
If
*NL*
you
think
I
am
not
happy
because
he
's
too
old
for
me
,
you
are
wrong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
anything
against
him
--
to
you
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
wo
n't
say
things
to
distress
me
,
will
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
no
more
,
but
he
knew
that
,
from
some
cause
or
other
,
in
*NL*
taking
Phillotson
as
a
husband
,
Sue
felt
that
she
had
done
what
she
*NL*
ought
not
to
have
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
plunged
into
the
concave
field
on
the
other
side
of
which
rose
*NL*
the
village
--
the
field
wherein
Jude
had
received
a
thrashing
from
*NL*
the
farmer
many
years
earlier
.
On
ascending
to
the
village
and
*NL*
approaching
the
house
they
found
Mrs.
Edlin
standing
at
the
door
,
who
*NL*
at
sight
of
them
lifted
her
hands
deprecatingly
.
``
She
's
downstairs
,
*NL*
if
you
'll
believe
me
!
''
cried
the
widow
.
``
Out
o
'
bed
she
got
,
and
*NL*
nothing
could
turn
her
.
What
will
come
o
'
t
I
do
not
know
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
entering
,
there
indeed
by
the
fireplace
sat
the
old
woman
,
wrapped
*NL*
in
blankets
,
and
turning
upon
them
a
countenance
like
that
of
*NL*
Sebastiano
's
Lazarus
.
They
must
have
looked
their
amazement
,
for
she
*NL*
said
in
a
hollow
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
--
sceered
ye
,
have
I
!
I
was
n't
going
to
bide
up
there
no
longer
,
*NL*
to
please
nobody
!
'T
is
more
than
flesh
and
blood
can
bear
,
to
be
*NL*
ordered
to
do
this
and
that
by
a
feller
that
do
n't
know
half
as
well
*NL*
as
you
do
yourself
!
...
Ah
--
you
'll
rue
this
marrying
as
well
as
*NL*
he
!
''
she
added
,
turning
to
Sue
.
``
All
our
family
do
--
and
nearly
all
*NL*
everybody
else
's

You
should
have
done
as

And
*NL*
Phillotson

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
makes

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

You

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

anything
definite

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

do

so
NOW
,
since

known

better
than
I

but
that
's
what
I
SHOULD
have
said

''
*NL*
*NL*
Sue
jumped
up
and
went
out
.
Jude
followed
her
,
and
found
her
in
the
*NL*
outhouse
,
crying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
cry
,
dear
!
''
said
Jude
in
distress
.
``
She
means
well
,
but
is
*NL*
very
crusty
and
queer
now
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
--
it
is
n't
that
!
''
said
Sue
,
trying
to
dry
her
eyes
.
``
I
do
n't
*NL*
mind
her
roughness
one
bit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
that
what
she
says
is
--
is
true
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
--
what
--
you
do
n't
like
him
?
''
asked
Jude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
mean
that
!
''
she
said
hastily
.
``
That
I
ought
--
perhaps
I
*NL*
ought
not
to
have
married
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
wondered
if
she
had
really
been
going
to
say
that
at
first
.
*NL*
They
went
back
,
and
the
subject
was
smoothed
over
,
and
her
aunt
took
*NL*
rather
kindly
to
Sue
,
telling
her
that
not
many
young
women
newly
*NL*
married
would
have
come
so
far
to
see
a
sick
old
crone
like
her
.
*NL*
In
the
afternoon
Sue
prepared
to
depart
,
Jude
hiring
a
neighbour
to
*NL*
drive
her
to
Alfredston
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
go
with
you
to
the
station
,
if
you
'd
like
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
would
not
let
him
.
The
man
came
round
with
the
trap
,
and
Jude
*NL*
helped
her
into
it
,
perhaps
with
unnecessary
attention
,
for
she
*NL*
looked
at
him
prohibitively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
--
I
may
come
to
see
you
some
day
,
when
I
am
back
again
at
*NL*
Melchester
?
''
he
half-crossly
observed
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
bent
down
and
said
softly
:
``
No
,
dear
--
you
are
not
to
come
yet
.
*NL*
I
do
n't
think
you
are
in
a
good
mood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
said
Jude
.
``
Good-bye
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
!
''
She
waved
her
hand
and
was
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
right
!
I
wo
n't
go
!
''
he
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
passed
the
evening
and
following
days
in
mortifying
by
every
*NL*
possible
means
his
wish
to
see
her
,
nearly
starving
himself
in
*NL*
attempts
to
extinguish
by
fasting
his
passionate
tendency
to
love
*NL*
her
.
He
read
sermons
on
discipline
,
and
hunted
up
passages
in
Church
*NL*
history
that
treated
of
the
Ascetics
of
the
second
century
.
Before
*NL*
he
had
returned
from
Marygreen
to
Melchester
there
arrived
a
letter
*NL*
from
Arabella
.
The
sight
of
it
revived
a
stronger
feeling
of
*NL*
self-condemnation
for
his
brief
return
to
her
society
than
for
his
*NL*
attachment
to
Sue
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
letter
,
he
perceived
,
bore
a
London
postmark
instead
of
the
*NL*
Christminster
one
.
Arabella
informed
him
that
a
few
days
after
their
*NL*
parting
in
the
morning
at
Christminster
,
she
had
been
surprised
by
an
*NL*
affectionate
letter
from
her
Australian
husband
,
formerly
manager
of
*NL*
the
hotel
in
Sydney
.
He
had
come
to
England
on
purpose
to
find
her
;
*NL*
and
had
taken
a
free
,
fully-licensed
public
,
in
Lambeth
,
where
he
*NL*
wished
her
to
join
him
in
conducting
the
business
,
which
was
likely
*NL*
to
be
a
very
thriving
one
,
the
house
being
situated
in
an
excellent
,
*NL*
densely
populated
,
gin-drinking
neighbourhood
,
and
already
doing
a
*NL*
trade
of
L200
a
month
,
which
could
be
easily
doubled
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
had
said
that
he
loved
her
very
much
still
,
and
implored
her
to
*NL*
tell
him
where
she
was
,
and
as
they
had
only
parted
in
a
slight
tiff
,
*NL*
and
as
her
engagement
in
Christminster
was
only
temporary
,
she
had
*NL*
just
gone
to
join
him
as
he
urged
.
She
could
not
help
feeling
that
*NL*
she
belonged
to
him
more
than
to
Jude
,
since
she
had
properly
married
*NL*
him
,
and
had
lived
with
him
much
longer
than
with
her
first
husband
.
*NL*
In
thus
wishing
Jude
good-bye
she
bore
him
no
ill-will
,
and
trusted
*NL*
he
would
not
turn
upon
her
,
a
weak
woman
,
and
inform
against
her
,
*NL*
and
bring
her
to
ruin
now
that
she
had
a
chance
of
improving
her
*NL*
circumstances
and
leading
a
genteel
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
X
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
returned
to
Melchester
,
which
had
the
questionable
*NL*
recommendation
of
being
only
a
dozen
and
a
half
miles
from
his
Sue
's
*NL*
now
permanent
residence
.
At
first
he
felt
that
this
nearness
was
a
*NL*
distinct
reason
for
not
going
southward
at
all
;
but
Christminster
*NL*
was
too
sad
a
place
to
bear
,
while
the
proximity
of
Shaston
to
*NL*
Melchester
might
afford
him
the
glory
of
worsting
the
Enemy
in
a
*NL*
close
engagement
,
such
as
was
deliberately
sought
by
the
priests
and
*NL*
virgins
of
the
early
Church
,
who
,
disdaining
an
ignominious
flight
*NL*
from
temptation
,
became
even
chamber-partners
with
impunity
.
*NL*
Jude
did
not
pause
to
remember
that
,
in
the
laconic
words
of
the
*NL*
historian
,
``
insulted
Nature
sometimes
vindicated
her
rights
''
in
such
*NL*
circumstances
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
now
returned
with
feverish
desperation
to
his
study
for
the
*NL*
priesthood
--
in
the
recognition
that
the
single-mindedness
of
his
*NL*
aims
,
and
his
fidelity
to
the
cause
,
had
been
more
than
questionable
*NL*
of
late
.
His
passion
for
Sue
troubled
his
soul
;
yet
his
lawful
*NL*
abandonment
to
the
society
of
Arabella
for
twelve
hours
seemed
*NL*
instinctively
a
worse
thing
--
even
though
she
had
not
told
him
of
her
*NL*
Sydney
husband
till
afterwards
.
He
had
,
he
verily
believed
,
overcome
*NL*
all
tendency
to
fly
to
liquor
--
which
,
indeed
,
he
had
never
done
from
*NL*
taste
,
but
merely
as
an
escape
from
intolerable
misery
of
mind
.
Yet
*NL*
he
perceived
with
despondency
that
,
taken
all
round
,
he
was
a
man
of
*NL*
too
many
passions
to
make
a
good
clergyman
;
the
utmost
he
could
hope
*NL*
for
was
that
in
a
life
of
constant
internal
warfare
between
flesh
and
*NL*
spirit
the
former
might
not
always
be
victorious
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
a
hobby
,
auxiliary
to
his
readings
in
Divinity
,
he
developed
his
*NL*
slight
skill
in
church-music
and
thorough-bass
,
till
he
could
join
in
*NL*
part-singing
from
notation
with
some
accuracy
.
A
mile
or
two
from
*NL*
Melchester
there
was
a
restored
village
church
,
to
which
Jude
had
*NL*
originally
gone
to
fix
the
new
columns
and
capitals
.
By
this
means
*NL*
he
had
become
acquainted
with
the
organist
,
and
the
ultimate
result
*NL*
was
that
he
joined
the
choir
as
a
bass
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
out
to
this
parish
twice
every
Sunday
,
and
sometimes
in
the
*NL*
week
.
One
evening
about
Easter
the
choir
met
for
practice
,
and
a
new
*NL*
hymn
which
Jude
had
heard
of
as
being
by
a
Wessex
composer
was
to
be
*NL*
tried
and
prepared
for
the
following
week
.
It
turned
out
to
be
a
*NL*
strangely
emotional
composition
.
As
they
all
sang
it
over
and
over
*NL*
again
its
harmonies
grew
upon
Jude
,
and
moved
him
exceedingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
had
finished
he
went
round
to
the
organist
to
make
*NL*
inquiries
.
The
score
was
in
manuscript
,
the
name
of
the
composer
*NL*
being
at
the
head
,
together
with
the
title
of
the
hymn
:
``
The
Foot
*NL*
of
the
Cross
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
the
organist
.
``
He
is
a
local
man
.
He
is
a
professional
*NL*
musician
at
Kennetbridge
--
between
here
and
Christminster
.
The
*NL*
vicar
knows
him
.
He
was
brought
up
and
educated
in
Christminster
*NL*
traditions
,
which
accounts
for
the
quality
of
the
piece
.
I
think
he
*NL*
plays
in
the
large
church
there
,
and
has
a
surpliced
choir
.
He
comes
*NL*
to
Melchester
sometimes
,
and
once
tried
to
get
the
cathedral
organ
*NL*
when
the
post
was
vacant
.
The
hymn
is
getting
about
everywhere
this
*NL*
Easter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
walked
humming
the
air
on
his
way
home
,
Jude
fell
to
musing
*NL*
on
its
composer
,
and
the
reasons
why
he
composed
it
.
What
a
man
of
*NL*
sympathies
he
must
be
!
Perplexed
and
harassed
as
he
himself
was
*NL*
about
Sue
and
Arabella
,
and
troubled
as
was
his
conscience
by
the
*NL*
complication
of
his
position
,
how
he
would
like
to
know
that
man
!
*NL*
``
He
of
all
men
would
understand
my
difficulties
,
''
said
the
impulsive
*NL*
Jude
.
If
there
were
any
person
in
the
world
to
choose
as
a
*NL*
confidant
,
this
composer
would
be
the
one
,
for
he
must
have
suffered
,
*NL*
and
throbbed
,
and
yearned
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
brief
,
ill
as
he
could
afford
the
time
and
money
for
the
journey
,
*NL*
Fawley
resolved
,
like
the
child
that
he
was
,
to
go
to
Kennetbridge
*NL*
the
very
next
Sunday
.
He
duly
started
,
early
in
the
morning
,
for
it
*NL*
was
only
by
a
series
of
crooked
railways
that
he
could
get
to
the
*NL*
town
.
About
mid-day
he
reached
it
,
and
crossing
the
bridge
into
the
*NL*
quaint
old
borough
he
inquired
for
the
house
of
the
composer
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
told
him
it
was
a
red
brick
building
some
little
way
further
on
.
*NL*
Also
that
the
gentleman
himself
had
just
passed
along
the
street
not
*NL*
five
minutes
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
way
?
''
asked
Jude
with
alacrity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Straight
along
homeward
from
church
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
hastened
on
,
and
soon
had
the
pleasure
of
observing
a
man
in
a
*NL*
black
coat
and
a
black
slouched
felt
hat
no
considerable
distance
*NL*
ahead
.
Stretching
out
his
legs
yet
more
widely
,
he
stalked
after
.
*NL*
``
A
hungry
soul
in
pursuit
of
a
full
soul
!
''
he
said
.
``
I
must
speak
*NL*
to
that
man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
,
however
,
overtake
the
musician
before
he
had
entered
*NL*
his
own
house
,
and
then
arose
the
question
if
this
were
an
expedient
*NL*
time
to
call
.
Whether
or
not
he
decided
to
do
so
there
and
then
,
now
*NL*
that
he
had
got
here
,
the
distance
home
being
too
great
for
him
to
*NL*
wait
till
late
in
the
afternoon
.
This
man
of
soul
would
understand
*NL*
scant
ceremony
,
and
might
be
quite
a
perfect
adviser
in
a
case
in
*NL*
which
an
earthly
and
illegitimate
passion
had
cunningly
obtained
*NL*
entrance
into
his
heart
through
the
opening
afforded
for
religion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
accordingly
rang
the
bell
,
and
was
admitted
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
musician
came
to
him
in
a
moment
,
and
being
respectably
dressed
,
*NL*
good-looking
,
and
frank
in
manner
,
Jude
obtained
a
favourable
*NL*
reception
.
He
was
nevertheless
conscious
that
there
would
be
a
*NL*
certain
awkwardness
in
explaining
his
errand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
singing
in
the
choir
of
a
little
church
near
*NL*
Melchester
,
''
he
said
.
``
And
we
have
this
week
practised
`
The
Foot
*NL*
of
the
Cross
,
'
which
I
understand
,
sir
,
that
you
composed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
--
a
year
or
so
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
--
like
it
.
I
think
it
supremely
beautiful
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
well
--
other
people
have
said
so
too
.
Yes
,
there
's
money
in
*NL*
it
,
if
I
could
only
see
about
getting
it
published
.
I
have
other
*NL*
compositions
to
go
with
it
,
too
;
I
wish
I
could
bring
them
out
;
for
*NL*
I
have
n't
made
a
five-pound
note
out
of
any
of
them
yet
.
These
*NL*
publishing
people
--
they
want
the
copyright
of
an
obscure
composer
's
*NL*
work
,
such
as
mine
is
,
for
almost
less
than
I
should
have
to
pay
a
*NL*
person
for
making
a
fair
manuscript
copy
of
the
score
.
The
one
you
*NL*
speak
of
I
have
lent
to
various
friends
about
here
and
Melchester
,
*NL*
and
so
it
has
got
to
be
sung
a
little
.
But
music
is
a
poor
staff
to
*NL*
lean
on
--
I
am
giving
it
up
entirely
.
You
must
go
into
trade
if
you
*NL*
want
to
make
money
nowadays
.
The
wine
business
is
what
I
am
thinking
*NL*
of
.
This
is
my
forthcoming
list
--
it
is
not
issued
yet
--
but
you
can
*NL*
take
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
handed
Jude
an
advertisement
list
of
several
pages
in
booklet
*NL*
shape
,
ornamentally
margined
with
a
red
line
,
in
which
were
set
forth
*NL*
the
various
clarets
,
champagnes
,
ports
,
sherries
,
and
other
wines
*NL*
with
which
he
purposed
to
initiate
his
new
venture
.
It
took
Jude
*NL*
more
than
by
surprise
that
the
man
with
the
soul
was
thus
and
thus
;
*NL*
and
he
felt
that
he
could
not
open
up
his
confidences
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
talked
a
little
longer
,
but
constrainedly
,
for
when
the
musician
*NL*
found
that
Jude
was
a
poor
man
his
manner
changed
from
what
it
had
*NL*
been
while
Jude
's
appearance
and
address
deceived
him
as
to
his
*NL*
position
and
pursuits
.
Jude
stammered
out
something
about
his
*NL*
feelings
in
wishing
to
congratulate
the
author
on
such
an
exalted
*NL*
composition
,
and
took
an
embarrassed
leave
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
way
home
by
the
slow
Sunday
train
,
sitting
in
the
fireless
*NL*
waiting-rooms
on
this
cold
spring
day
,
he
was
depressed
enough
at
*NL*
his
simplicity
in
taking
such
a
journey
.
But
no
sooner
did
he
reach
*NL*
his
Melchester
lodging
than
he
found
awaiting
him
a
letter
which
had
*NL*
arrived
that
morning
a
few
minutes
after
he
had
left
the
house
.
It
*NL*
was
a
contrite
little
note
from
Sue
,
in
which
she
said
,
with
sweet
*NL*
humility
,
that
she
felt
she
had
been
horrid
in
telling
him
he
*NL*
was
not
to
come
to
see
her
,
that
she
despised
herself
for
having
*NL*
been
so
conventional
;
and
that
he
was
to
be
sure
to
come
by
the
*NL*
eleven-forty-five
train
that
very
Sunday
,
and
have
dinner
with
them
*NL*
at
half-past
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
almost
tore
his
hair
at
having
missed
this
letter
till
it
was
*NL*
too
late
to
act
upon
its
contents
;
but
he
had
chastened
himself
*NL*
considerably
of
late
,
and
at
last
his
chimerical
expedition
*NL*
to
Kennetbridge
really
did
seem
to
have
been
another
special
*NL*
intervention
of
Providence
to
keep
him
away
from
temptation
.
But
a
*NL*
growing
impatience
of
faith
,
which
he
had
noticed
in
himself
more
*NL*
than
once
of
late
,
made
him
pass
over
in
ridicule
the
idea
that
God
*NL*
sent
people
on
fools
'
errands
.
He
longed
to
see
her
;
he
was
angry
*NL*
at
having
missed
her
:
and
he
wrote
instantly
,
telling
her
what
had
*NL*
happened
,
and
saying
he
had
not
enough
patience
to
wait
till
the
*NL*
following
Sunday
,
but
would
come
any
day
in
the
week
that
she
liked
*NL*
to
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
he
wrote
a
little
over-ardently
,
Sue
,
as
her
manner
was
,
*NL*
delayed
her
reply
till
Thursday
before
Good
Friday
,
when
she
said
he
*NL*
might
come
that
afternoon
if
he
wished
,
this
being
the
earliest
day
*NL*
on
which
she
could
welcome
him
,
for
she
was
now
assistant-teacher
in
*NL*
her
husband
's
school
.
Jude
therefore
got
leave
from
the
cathedral
*NL*
works
at
the
trifling
expense
of
a
stoppage
of
pay
,
and
went
.

the

such
strange
reports
*NL*
arise
,
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
as
Drayton
sang
it
-RRB-
,
was
,
and
is
,
in
itself
the
city
of
a
dream
.
*NL*
Vague
imaginings
of
its
castle
,
its
three
mints
,
its
magnificent
*NL*
apsidal
abbey
,
the
chief
glory
of
South
Wessex
,
its
twelve
churches
,
*NL*
its
shrines
,
chantries
,
hospitals
,
its
gabled
freestone
mansions
--
all
*NL*
now
ruthlessly
swept
away
--
throw
the
visitor
,
even
against
his
will
,
*NL*
into
a
pensive
melancholy
,
which
the
stimulating
atmosphere
and
*NL*
limitless
landscape
around
him
can
scarcely
dispel
.
The
spot
was
the
*NL*
burial-place
of
a
king
and
a
queen
,
of
abbots
and
abbesses
,
saints
*NL*
and
bishops
,
knights
and
squires
.
The
bones
of
King
Edward
``
the
*NL*
Martyr
,
''
carefully
removed
hither
for
holy
preservation
,
brought
*NL*
Shaston
a
renown
which
made
it
the
resort
of
pilgrims
from
every
part
*NL*
of
Europe
,
and
enabled
it
to
maintain
a
reputation
extending
far
*NL*
beyond
English
shores
.
To
this
fair
creation
of
the
great
Middle-Age
*NL*
the
Dissolution
was
,
as
historians
tell
us
,
the
death-knell
.
With
*NL*
the
destruction
of
the
enormous
abbey
the
whole
place
collapsed
in
a
*NL*
general
ruin
:
the
Martyr
's
bones
met
with
the
fate
of
the
sacred
pile
*NL*
that
held
them
,
and
not
a
stone
is
now
left
to
tell
where
they
lie
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
natural
picturesqueness
and
singularity
of
the
town
still
remain
;
*NL*
but
strange
to
say
these
qualities
,
which
were
noted
by
many
writers
*NL*
in
ages
when
scenic
beauty
is
said
to
have
been
unappreciated
,
are
*NL*
passed
over
in
this
,
and
one
of
the
queerest
and
quaintest
spots
in
*NL*
England
stands
virtually
unvisited
to-day
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
has
a
unique
position
on
the
summit
of
a
steep
and
imposing
scarp
,
*NL*
rising
on
the
north
,
south
,
and
west
sides
of
the
borough
out
of
*NL*
the
deep
alluvial
Vale
of
Blackmoor
,
the
view
from
the
Castle
Green
*NL*
over
three
counties
of
verdant
pasture
--
South
,
Mid
,
and
Nether
*NL*
Wessex
--
being
as
sudden
a
surprise
to
the
unexpectant
traveller
's
*NL*
eyes
as
the
medicinal
air
is
to
his
lungs
.
Impossible
to
a
railway
,
*NL*
it
can
best
be
reached
on
foot
,
next
best
by
light
vehicles
;
and
*NL*
it
is
hardly
accessible
to
these
but
by
a
sort
of
isthmus
on
the
*NL*
north-east
,
that
connects
it
with
the
high
chalk
table-land
on
that

side

*NL*
Such
is
,
and
such
was
,
the
now
world-forgotten
Shaston
or
Palladour
.
*NL*
Its
situation
rendered
water
the
great
want
of
the
town
;
and
within
*NL*
living
memory
,
horses
,
donkeys
and
men
may
have
been
seen
toiling
*NL*
up
the
winding
ways
to
the
top
of
the
height
,
laden
with
tubs
and
*NL*
barrels
filled
from
the
wells
beneath
the
mountain
,
and
hawkers
*NL*
retailing
their
contents
at
the
price
of
a
halfpenny
a
bucketful

*NL*
This
difficulty
in
the
water
supply
,
together
with
two
other
odd
*NL*
facts
,
namely
,
that
the
chief
graveyard
slopes
up
as
steeply
as
a
*NL*
roof
behind
the
church
,
and
that
in
former
times
the
town
passed
*NL*
through
a
curious
period
of
corruption
,
conventual
and
domestic
,
gave
*NL*
rise
to
the
saying
that
Shaston
was
remarkable
for
three
consolations
*NL*
to
man
,
such
as
the
world
afforded
not
elsewhere
.
It
was
a
place
*NL*
where
the
churchyard
lay
nearer
heaven
than
the
church
steeple
,
where
*NL*
beer
was
more
plentiful
than
water
,
and
where
there
were
more
wanton
*NL*
women
than
honest
wives
and
maids
.
It
is
also
said
that
after
the
*NL*
Middle
Ages
the
inhabitants
were
too
poor
to
pay
their
priests
,
*NL*
and
hence
were
compelled
to
pull
down
their
churches
,
and
refrain
*NL*
altogether
from
the
public
worship
of
God
;
a
necessity
which
they
*NL*
bemoaned
over
their
cups
in
the
settles
of
their
inns
on
Sunday
*NL*
afternoons
.
In
those
days
the
Shastonians
were
apparently
not
*NL*
without
a
sense
of
humour
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
another
peculiarity
--
this
a
modern
one
--
which
Shaston
*NL*
appeared
to
owe
to
its
site
.
It
was
the
resting-place
and
*NL*
headquarters
of
the
proprietors
of
wandering
vans
,
shows
,
*NL*
shooting-galleries
,
and
other
itinerant
concerns
,
whose
business
*NL*
lay
largely
at
fairs
and
markets
.
As
strange
wild
birds
are
seen
*NL*
assembled
on
some
lofty
promontory
,
meditatively
pausing
for
longer
*NL*
flights
,
or
to
return
by
the
course
they
followed
thither
,
so
here
,
*NL*
in
this
cliff-town
,
stood
in
stultified
silence
the
yellow
and
green
*NL*
caravans
bearing
names
not
local
,
as
if
surprised
by
a
change
in
the
*NL*
landscape
so
violent
as
to
hinder
their
further
progress
;
and
here
*NL*
they
usually
remained
all
the
winter
till
they
turned
to
seek
again
*NL*
their
old
tracks
in
the
following
spring
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
to
this
breezy
and
whimsical
spot
that
Jude
ascended
from
the
*NL*
nearest
station
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
about
four
o'clock
one
*NL*
afternoon
,
and
entering
on
the
summit
of
the
peak
after
a
toilsome
*NL*
climb
,
passed
the
first
houses
of
the
aerial
town
;
and
drew
towards
*NL*
the
school-house
.
The
hour
was
too
early
;
the
pupils
were
still
in
*NL*
school
,
humming
small
,
like
a
swarm
of
gnats
;
and
he
withdrew
a
few
*NL*
steps
along
Abbey
Walk
,
whence
he
regarded
the
spot
which
fate
had
*NL*
made
the
home
of
all
he
loved
best
in
the
world
.
In
front
of
the
*NL*
schools
,
which
were
extensive
and
stone-built
,
grew
two
enormous
*NL*
beeches
with
smooth
mouse-coloured
trunks
,
as
such
trees
will
only
*NL*
grow
on
chalk
uplands
.
Within
the
mullioned
and
transomed
windows
he
*NL*
could
see
the
black
,
brown
,
and
flaxen
crowns
of
the
scholars
over
*NL*
the
sills
,
and
to
pass
the
time
away
he
walked
down
to
the
level
*NL*
terrace
where
the
abbey
gardens
once
had
spread
,
his
heart
throbbing
*NL*
in
spite
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Unwilling
to
enter
till
the
children
were
dismissed
he
remained
here
*NL*
till
young
voices
could
be
heard
in
the
open
air
,
and
girls
in
white
*NL*
pinafores
over
red
and
blue
frocks
appeared
dancing
along
the
paths
*NL*
which
the
abbess
,
prioress
,
subprioress
,
and
fifty
nuns
had
demurely
*NL*
paced
three
centuries
earlier
.
Retracing
his
steps
he
found
that
he
*NL*
had
waited
too
long
,
and
that
Sue
had
gone
out
into
the
town
at
the
*NL*
heels
of
the
last
scholar
,
Mr.
Phillotson
having
been
absent
all
the
*NL*
afternoon
at
a
teachers
'
meeting
at
Shottsford
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
went
into
the
empty
schoolroom
and
sat
down
,
the
girl
who
was
*NL*
sweeping
the
floor
having
informed
him
that
Mrs.
Phillotson
would
be
*NL*
back
again
in
a
few
minutes
.
A
piano
stood
near
--
actually
the
old
*NL*
piano
that
Phillotson
had
possessed
at
Marygreen
--
and
though
the
dark
*NL*
afternoon
almost
prevented
him
seeing
the
notes
Jude
touched
them
in
*NL*
his
humble
way
,
and
could
not
help
modulating
into
the
hymn
which
had
*NL*
so
affected
him
in
the
previous
week
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
figure
moved
behind
him
,
and
thinking
it
was
still
the
girl
with
*NL*
the
broom
Jude
took
no
notice
,
till
the
person
came
close
and
laid
*NL*
her
fingers
lightly
upon
his
bass
hand
.
The
imposed
hand
was
a
*NL*
little
one
he
seemed
to
know
,
and
he
turned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
stop
,
''
said
Sue
.
``
I
like
it
.
I
learnt
it
before
I
left
*NL*
Melchester
.
They
used
to
play
it
in
the
training
school
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
strum
before
you
!
Play
it
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
well
--
I
do
n't
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sue
sat
down
,
and
her
rendering
of
the
piece
,
though
not
remarkable
,
*NL*
seemed
divine
as
compared
with
his
own
.
She
,
like
him
,
was
evidently
*NL*
touched
--
to
her
own
surprise
--
by
the
recalled
air
;
and
when
she
*NL*
had
finished
,
and
he
moved
his
hand
towards
hers
,
it
met
his
own
*NL*
half-way
.
Jude
grasped
it
--
just
as
he
had
done
before
her
marriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
odd
,
''
she
said
,
in
a
voice
quite
changed
,
``
that
I
should
care
*NL*
about
that
air
;
because
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
that
sort
--
quite
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
easily
moved
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
quite
mean
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
you
ARE
one
of
that
sort
,
for
you
are
just
like
me
at
*NL*
heart
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
not
at
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
played
on
and
suddenly
turned
round
;
and
by
an
unpremeditated
*NL*
instinct
each
clasped
the
other
's
hand
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
uttered
a
forced
little
laugh
as
she
relinquished
his
quickly
.
*NL*
``
How
funny
!
''
she
said
.
``
I
wonder
what
we
both
did
that
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
because
we
are
both
alike
,
as
I
said
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
in
our
thoughts
!
Perhaps
a
little
in
our
feelings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
they
rule
thoughts
...
Is
n't
it
enough
to
make
one
blaspheme
*NL*
that
the
composer
of
that
hymn
is
one
of
the
most
commonplace
men
I
*NL*
ever
met
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
--
you
know
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
went
to
see
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
goose
--
to
do
just
what
I
should
have
done
!
Why
did
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
we
are
not
alike
,
''
he
said
drily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
we
'll
have
some
tea
,
''
said
Sue
.
``
Shall
we
have
it
here
instead
*NL*
of
in
my
house
?
It
is
no
trouble
to
get
the
kettle
and
things
*NL*
brought
in
.
We
do
n't
live
at
the
school
you
know
,
but
in
that
*NL*
ancient
dwelling
across
the
way
called
Old-Grove
Place
.
It
is
so
*NL*
antique
and
dismal
that
it
depresses
me
dreadfully
.
Such
houses
are
*NL*
very
well
to
visit
,
but
not
to
live
in
--
I
feel
crushed
into
the
earth
*NL*
by
the
weight
of
so
many
previous
lives
there
spent
.
In
a
new
place
*NL*
like
these
schools
there
is
only
your
own
life
to
support
.
Sit
down
,
*NL*
and
I
'll
tell
Ada
to
bring
the
tea-things
across
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
waited
in
the
light
of
the
stove
,
the
door
of
which
she
flung
open
*NL*
before
going
out
,
and
when
she
returned
,
followed
by
the
maiden
with
*NL*
tea
,
they
sat
down
by
the
same
light
,
assisted
by
the
blue
rays
of
a
*NL*
spirit-lamp
under
the
brass
kettle
on
the
stand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
one
of
your
wedding-presents
to
me
,
''
she
said
,
signifying
*NL*
the
latter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Jude
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
kettle
of
his
gift
sang
with
some
satire
in
its
note
,
to
his
*NL*
mind
;
and
to
change
the
subject
he
said
,
``
Do
you
know
of
any
good
*NL*
readable
edition
of
the
uncanonical
books
of
the
New
Testament
?
You
*NL*
do
n't
read
them
in
the
school
I
suppose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
dear
no
!
--
`
twould
alarm
the
neighbourhood
...
Yes
,
there
is
one
.
*NL*
I
am
not
familiar
with
it
now
,
though
I
was
interested
in
it
when
my
*NL*
former
friend
was
alive
.
Cowper
's
_
Apocryphal
Gospels
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
sounds
like
what
I
want
.
''
His
thoughts
,
however
reverted
with
*NL*
a
twinge
to
the
``
former
friend
''
--
by
whom
she
meant
,
as
he
knew
,
the
*NL*
university
comrade
of
her
earlier
days
.
He
wondered
if
she
talked
of
*NL*
him
to
Phillotson
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Gospel
of
Nicodemus
is
very
nice
,
''
she
went
on
to
keep
him
from
*NL*
his
jealous
thoughts
,
which
she
read
clearly
,
as
she
always
did
.
*NL*
Indeed
when
they
talked
on
an
indifferent
subject
,
as
now
,
there
was
*NL*
ever
a
second
silent
conversation
passing
between
their
emotions
,
*NL*
so
perfect
was
the
reciprocity
between
them
.
``
It
is
quite
like
the
*NL*
genuine
article
.
All
cut
up
into
verses
,
too
;
so
that
it
is
like
*NL*
one
of
the
other
evangelists
read
in
a
dream
,
when
things
are
the
*NL*
same
,
yet
not
the
same
.
But
,
Jude
,
do
you
take
an
interest
in
those
*NL*
questions
still
?
Are
you
getting
up
_
Apologetica
_
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
I
am
reading
Divinity
harder
than
ever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
regarded
him
curiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
look
at
me
like
that
?
''
said
Jude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
why
do
you
want
to
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
you
can
tell
me
anything
I
may
be
ignorant
of
in
that

subject

You
must
have
learnt
a
lot
of
everything
from
your
dear
*NL*
dead
friend

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
wo
n't
get
on
to
that
now

she
coaxed
.
``
Will
you
be
carving
out
*NL*
at
that
church
again
next
week
,
where
you
learnt
the
pretty
hymn
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

perhaps
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
be
very
nice

Shall
I
come
and
see
you
there

It
is
in

this
direction

and
I
could
come
any
afternoon
by
train
for
half
an

hour

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

Do

*NL*
*NL*
``

``
No

The
*NL*
_
tremolo
_
in
her
voice
caused
her
to
break
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sue
,
I
sometimes
think
you
are
a
flirt

''
said
he
abruptly
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
momentary
pause
,
till
she
suddenly
jumped
up
;
and
to
his
*NL*
surprise
he
saw
by
the
kettle-flame
that
her
face
was
flushed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
talk
to
you
any
longer
,
Jude
!
''
she
said
,
the
tragic
*NL*
contralto
note
having
come
back
as
of
old
.
``
It
is
getting
too
dark
*NL*
to
stay
together
like
this

after
playing
morbid
Good
Friday
tunes

make
one
feel
what
one

We
must
n't
sit
and
talk
*NL*
in
this
way
any
more

Yes

you
must
go
away
,
for
you
mistake
me
!
I
*NL*
am
very
much
the
reverse
of
what
you
say
so
cruelly
--
Oh
,
Jude
,
it
WAS
*NL*
cruel
to
say
that
!
Yet
I
ca
n't
tell
you
the
truth
--
I
should
shock
*NL*
you
by
letting
you
know
how
I
give
way
to
my
impulses

how
much
I
*NL*
feel
that
I
should
n't
have
been
provided
with
attractiveness
unless

it
were
meant
to
be
exercised

Some
women
's
love

being
loved
is
*NL*
insatiable
;

so
,
often
,
is
their
love
of
loving
;

in
the
last

case
they
may
find
that
they
ca

give
it
continuously
to
the
*NL*
chamber-officer
appointed
by
the
bishop
's
licence
to
receive
it
.
*NL*
But
you
are
so
straightforward
,
Jude

that
you
ca
n't
understand

me
!

Now
you
must
go

I
am
sorry

*NL*
``
Are

It

sad

*NL*
*NL*
As
they
had
overdone
the
grasp
of
hands
some
time
sooner
,
she
touched
*NL*
his
fingers
but
lightly
when
he
went
out
now
.
He
had
hardly
gone
*NL*
from
the
door
when
,
with
a
dissatisfied
look
,
she
jumped
on
a
form
*NL*
and
opened
the
iron
casement
of
a
window
beneath
which
he
was
passing
*NL*
in
the
path
without
.
``
When

Jude

she
asked

*NL*
He
looked
up
in
some
surprise

wander
about

*NL*
``

*NL*
``

give
up
half
*NL*
a
day
's
work
to
come
to
see
me
!
...
You
are
Joseph
the
dreamer
of
*NL*
dreams
,
dear
Jude
.
And
a
tragic
Don
Quixote
.
And
sometimes
you
*NL*
are
St.
Stephen
,
who
,
while
they
were
stoning
him
,
could
see
Heaven
*NL*
opened
.
Oh
,
my
poor
friend
and
comrade
,
you
'll
suffer
yet
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Now
that
the
high
window-sill
was
between
them
,
so
that
he
could
not
*NL*
get
at
her
,
she
seemed
not
to
mind
indulging
in
a
frankness
she
had
*NL*
feared
at
close
quarters
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
thinking
,
''
she
continued
,
still
in
the
tone
of
one
*NL*
brimful
of
feeling
,
``
that
the
social
moulds
civilization
fits
us
into
*NL*
have
no
more
relation
to
our
actual
shapes
than
the
conventional
*NL*
shapes
of
the
constellations
have
to
the
real
star-patterns
.
I
*NL*
am
called
Mrs.
Richard
Phillotson
,
living
a
calm
wedded
life
with
*NL*
my
counterpart
of
that
name
.
But
I
am
not
really
Mrs.
Richard
*NL*
Phillotson
,
but
a
woman
tossed
about
,
all
alone
,
with
aberrant
*NL*
passions
,
and
unaccountable
antipathies
...
Now
you
must
n't
wait
*NL*
longer
,
or
you
will
lose
the
coach
.
Come
and
see
me
again
.
You
*NL*
must
come
to
the
house
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
!
''
said
Jude
.
``
When
shall
it
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To-morrow
week
.
Good-bye
--
good-bye
!
''
She
stretched
out
her
hand
*NL*
and
stroked
his
forehead
pitifully
--
just
once
.
Jude
said
good-bye
,
*NL*
and
went
away
into
the
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Passing
along
Bimport
Street
he
thought
he
heard
the
wheels
of
the
*NL*
coach
departing
,
and
,
truly
enough
,
when
he
reached
the
Duke
's
Arms
*NL*
in
the
Market
Place
the
coach
had
gone
.
It
was
impossible
for
him
*NL*
to
get
to
the
station
on
foot
in
time
for
this
train
,
and
he
settled
*NL*
himself
perforce
to
wait
for
the
next
--
the
last
to
Melchester
that
*NL*
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
wandered
about
awhile
,
obtained
something
to
eat
;
and
then
,
having
*NL*
another
half-hour
on
his
hands
,
his
feet
involuntarily
took
him
*NL*
through
the
venerable
graveyard
of
Trinity
Church
,
with
its
avenues
*NL*
of
limes
,
in
the
direction
of
the
schools
again
.
They
were
entirely
*NL*
in
darkness
.
She
had
said
she
lived
over
the
way
at
Old-Grove
*NL*
Place
,
a
house
which
he
soon
discovered
from
her
description
of
its
*NL*
antiquity
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
glimmering
candlelight
shone
from
a
front
window
,
the
shutters
*NL*
being
yet
unclosed
.
He
could
see
the
interior
clearly
--
the
floor
*NL*
sinking
a
couple
of
steps
below
the
road
without
,
which
had
become
*NL*
raised
during
the
centuries
since
the
house
was
built
.
Sue
,
*NL*
evidently
just
come
in
,
was
standing
with
her
hat
on
in
this
front
*NL*
parlour
or
sitting-room
,
whose
walls
were
lined
with
wainscoting
*NL*
of
panelled
oak
reaching
from
floor
to
ceiling
,
the
latter
being
*NL*
crossed
by
huge
moulded
beams
only
a
little
way
above
her
head
.
The
*NL*
mantelpiece
was
of
the
same
heavy
description
,
carved
with
Jacobean
*NL*
pilasters
and
scroll-work
.
The
centuries
did
,
indeed
,
ponderously
*NL*
overhang
a
young
wife
who
passed
her
time
here
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
opened
a
rosewood
work-box
,
and
was
looking
at
a
photograph
.
*NL*
Having
contemplated
it
a
little
while
she
pressed
it
against
her
*NL*
bosom
,
and
put
it
again
in
its
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
becoming
aware
that
she
had
not
obscured
the
windows
she
came
*NL*
forward
to
do
so
,
candle
in
hand
.
It
was
too
dark
for
her
to
see
*NL*
Jude
without
,
but
he
could
see
her
face
distinctly
,
and
there
was
an
*NL*
unmistakable
tearfulness
about
the
dark
,
long-lashed
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
closed
the
shutters
,
and
Jude
turned
away
to
pursue
his
solitary
*NL*
journey
home
.
``
Whose
photograph
was
she
looking
at
?
''
he
said
.
He
*NL*
had
once
given
her
his
;
but
she
had
others
,
he
knew
.
Yet
it
was
his
,
*NL*
surely
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
knew
he
should
go
to
see
her
again
,
according
to
her
invitation
.
*NL*
Those
earnest
men
he
read
of
,
the
saints
,
whom
Sue
,
with
gentle
*NL*
irreverence
,
called
his
demi-gods
,
would
have
shunned
such
encounters
*NL*
if
they
doubted
their
own
strength
.
But
he
could
not
.
He
might
fast
*NL*
and
pray
during
the
whole
interval
,
but
the
human
was
more
powerful
*NL*
in
him
than
the
Divine
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
if
God
disposed
not
,
woman
did
.
The
next
morning
but
one
*NL*
brought
him
this
note
from
her
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Do
n't
come
next
week
.
On
your
own
account
do
n't
!
We
were
*NL*
too
free
,
under
the
influence
of
that
morbid
hymn
and
the
*NL*
twilight
.
Think
no
more
than
you
can
help
of
*NL*
*NL*
SUSANNA
FLORENCE
MARY
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
disappointment
was
keen
.
He
knew
her
mood
,
the
look
of
her
face
,
*NL*
when
she
subscribed
herself
at
length
thus
.
But
,
whatever
her
mood
,
he
*NL*
could
not
say
she
was
wrong
in
her
view
.
He
replied
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
acquiesce
.
You
are
right
.
It
is
a
lesson
in
*NL*
renunciation
which
I
suppose
I
ought
to
learn
at
this
*NL*
season
.
*NL*
*NL*
JUDE
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
despatched
the
note
on
Easter
Eve
,
and
there
seemed
a
finality
*NL*
in
their
decisions
.
But
other
forces
and
laws
than
theirs
were
in
*NL*
operation
.
On
Easter
Monday
morning
he
received
a
message
from
the
*NL*
Widow
Edlin
,
whom
he
had
directed
to
telegraph
if
anything
serious
*NL*
happened
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Your
aunt
is
sinking
.
Come
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
threw
down
his
tools
and
went
.
Three
and
a
half
hours
later
he
*NL*
was
crossing
the
downs
about
Marygreen
,
and
presently
plunged
into
*NL*
the
concave
field
across
which
the
short
cut
was
made
to
the
village
.
*NL*
As
he
ascended
on
the
other
side
a
labouring
man
,
who
had
been
*NL*
watching
his
approach
from
a
gate
across
the
path
,
moved
uneasily
,
*NL*
and
prepared
to
speak
.
``
I
can
see
in
his
face
that
she
is
dead
,
''
*NL*
said
Jude
.
``
Poor
Aunt
Drusilla
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
as
he
had
supposed
,
and
Mrs.
Edlin
had
sent
out
the
man
to
*NL*
break
the
news
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
would
n't
have
knowed
`
ee
.
She
lay
like
a
doll
wi
'
glass
eyes
;
*NL*
so
it
did
n't
matter
that
you
was
n't
here
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
went
on
to
the
house
,
and
in
the
afternoon
,
when
everything
was
*NL*
done
,
and
the
layers-out
had
finished
their
beer
,
and
gone
,
he
sat
*NL*
down
alone
in
the
silent
place
.
It
was
absolutely
necessary
to
*NL*
communicate
with
Sue
,
though
two
or
three
days
earlier
they
had
*NL*
agreed
to
mutual
severance
.
He
wrote
in
the
briefest
terms
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Aunt
Drusilla
is
dead
,
having
been
taken
almost
suddenly
.
*NL*
The
funeral
is
on
Friday
afternoon
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
remained
in
and
about
Marygreen
through
the
intervening
days
,
*NL*
went
out
on
Friday
morning
to
see
that
the
grave
was
finished
,
and
*NL*
wondered
if
Sue
would
come
.
She
had
not
written
,
and
that
seemed
to
*NL*
signify
rather
that
she
would
come
than
that
she
would
not
.
Having
*NL*
timed
her
by
her
only
possible
train
,
he
locked
the
door
about
*NL*
mid-day
,
and
crossed
the
hollow
field
to
the
verge
of
the
upland
by
*NL*
the
Brown
House
,
where
he
stood
and
looked
over
the
vast
prospect
*NL*
northwards
,
and
over
the
nearer
landscape
in
which
Alfredston
stood
.
*NL*
Two
miles
behind
it
a
jet
of
white
steam
was
travelling
from
the
left
*NL*
to
the
right
of
the
picture
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
long
time
to
wait
,
even
now
,
till
he
would
know
if
she
*NL*
had
arrived
.
He
did
wait
,
however
,
and
at
last
a
small
hired
vehicle
*NL*
pulled
up
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
,
and
a
person
alighted
,
the
*NL*
conveyance
going
back
,
while
the
passenger
began
ascending
the
*NL*
hill
.
He
knew
her
;
and
she
looked
so
slender
to-day
that
it
seemed
*NL*
as
if
she
might
be
crushed
in
the
intensity
of
a
too
passionate
*NL*
embrace
--
such
as
it
was
not
for
him
to
give
.
Two-thirds
of
the
way
*NL*
up
her
head
suddenly
took
a
solicitous
poise
,
and
he
knew
that
she
*NL*
had
at
that
moment
recognized
him
.
Her
face
soon
began
a
pensive
*NL*
smile
,
which
lasted
till
,
having
descended
a
little
way
,
he
met
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
,
''
she
began
with
nervous
quickness
,
``
that
it
would
be
*NL*
so
sad
to
let
you
attend
the
funeral
alone
!
And
so
--
at
the
last
*NL*
moment
--
I
came
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
faithful
Sue
!
''
murmured
Jude
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
elusiveness
of
her
curious
double
nature
,
however
,
Sue
did
*NL*
not
stand
still
for
any
further
greeting
,
though
it
wanted
some
*NL*
time
to
the
burial
.
A
pathos
so
unusually
compounded
as
that
which
*NL*
attached
to
this
hour
was
unlikely
to
repeat
itself
for
years
,
if
*NL*
ever
,
and
Jude
would
have
paused
,
and
meditated
,
and
conversed
.
But
*NL*
Sue
either
saw
it
not
at
all
,
or
,
seeing
it
more
than
he
,
would
not
*NL*
allow
herself
to
feel
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sad
and
simple
ceremony
was
soon
over
,
their
progress
to
the
*NL*
church
being
almost
at
a
trot
,
the
bustling
undertaker
having
a
more
*NL*
important
funeral
an
hour
later
,
three
miles
off
.
Drusilla
was
put
*NL*
into
the
new
ground
,
quite
away
from
her
ancestors
.
Sue
and
Jude
*NL*
had
gone
side
by
side
to
the
grave
,
and
now
sat
down
to
tea
in
the
*NL*
familiar
house
;
their
lives
united
at
least
in
this
last
attention
*NL*
to
the
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
was
opposed
to
marriage
,
from
first
to
last
,
you
say
?
''
murmured
*NL*
Sue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
Particularly
for
members
of
our
family
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
eyes
met
his
,
and
remained
on
him
awhile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
rather
a
sad
family
,
do
n't
you
think
,
Jude
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
said
we
made
bad
husbands
and
wives
.
Certainly
we
make
unhappy
*NL*
ones
.
At
all
events
,
I
do
,
for
one
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sue
was
silent
.
``
Is
it
wrong
,
Jude
,
''
she
said
with
a
tentative
*NL*
tremor
,
``
for
a
husband
or
wife
to
tell
a
third
person
that
they
are
*NL*
unhappy
in
their
marriage
?
If
a
marriage
ceremony
is
a
religious
*NL*
thing
,
it
is
possibly
wrong
;
but
if
it
is
only
a
sordid
contract
,
*NL*
based
on
material
convenience
in
householding
,
rating
,
and
taxing
,
*NL*
and
the
inheritance
of
land
and
money
by
children
,
making
it
*NL*
necessary
that
the
male
parent
should
be
known
--
which
it
seems
to
*NL*
be
--
why
surely
a
person
may
say
,
even
proclaim
upon
the
housetops
,
*NL*
that
it
hurts
and
grieves
him
or
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
said
so
,
anyhow
,
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
she
went
on
:
``
Are
there
many
couples
,
do
you
think
,
where
*NL*
one
dislikes
the
other
for
no
definite
fault
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
suppose
.
If
either
cares
for
another
person
,
for
instance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
even
apart
from
that
?
Would
n't
the
woman
,
for
example
,
be
very
*NL*
bad-natured
if
she
did
n't
like
to
live
with
her
husband
;
merely
''
--
her
*NL*
voice
undulated
,
and
he
guessed
things
--
``
merely
because
she
had
a
*NL*
personal
feeling
against
it
--
a
physical
objection
--
a
fastidiousness
,
*NL*
or
whatever
it
may
be
called
--
although
she
might
respect
and
be
*NL*
grateful
to
him
?
I
am
merely
putting
a
case
.
Ought
she
to
try
to
*NL*
overcome
her
pruderies
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
threw
a
troubled
look
at
her
.
He
said
,
looking
away
:
``
It
would
*NL*
be
just
one
of
those
cases
in
which
my
experiences
go
contrary
to
my
*NL*
dogmas
.
Speaking
as
an
order-loving
man
--
which
I
hope
I
am
,
though
*NL*
I
fear
I
am
not
--
I
should
say
,
yes
.
Speaking
from
experience
and
*NL*
unbiased
nature
,
I
should
say
,
no
...
Sue
,
I
believe
you
are
not
*NL*
happy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
am
!
''
she
contradicted
.
``
How
can
a
woman
be
unhappy
who
*NL*
has
only
been
married
eight
weeks
to
a
man
she
chose
freely

''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Chose
freely

'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
repeat
it
?

But
I
have
to
go
back
by
the
six
o'clock
*NL*
train

You
will
be
staying
on
here

*NL*
*NL*
``
For

Shall
I
go
to
the
train
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
little
laugh
of
objection
came
from
Sue
.
``
I
think
not
.
You
may
*NL*
come
part
of
the
way

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
stop

*NL*
*NL*
``
Very

she
said
dubiously
.
``
I

tell
him

would
come
for

*NL*
*NL*
Jude
went
to
the
widow
's
house
adjoining
,
to
let
her
know
;
and
*NL*
returning
in
a
few
minutes
sat
down
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
horrible
how
we
are
circumstanced
,
Sue
--
horrible
!
''
he
said
*NL*
abruptly
,
with
his
eyes
bent
to
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
tell
you
all
my
part
of
the
gloom
.
Your
part
is
that
you
*NL*
ought
not
to
have
married
him
.
I
saw
it
before
you
had
done
it
,
but
*NL*
I
thought
I
must
n't
interfere
.
I
was
wrong
.
I
ought
to
have
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
makes
you
assume
all
this
,
dear

*NL*
*NL*
``
Because

I
can
see
you
through
your
feathers

my
poor
little
bird

*NL*
*NL*
Her
hand
lay
on
the
table
,
and
Jude
put
his
upon
it
.
Sue
drew
hers
*NL*
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
absurd
,
Sue
,
''
cried
he
,
``
after
what
we
've
been
talking
about
!
*NL*
I
am
more
strict
and
formal
than
you
,
if
it
comes
to
that
;
and
that
*NL*
you
should
object
to
such
an
innocent
action
shows
that
you
are
*NL*
ridiculously
inconsistent
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
it
was
too
prudish
,
''
she
said
repentantly
.
``
Only
I
have
*NL*
fancied
it
was
a
sort
of
trick
of
ours

too
frequent
perhaps

There

*NL*
you
may
hold
it
as
much
as
you
like

Is
that
good
of
me
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

very
.

*NL*
*NL*

must
tell
him

*NL*
``
Richard

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

him
needlessly

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

are
you
sure

*NL*

Absolutely

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
seen
Arabella

*NL*
*NL*
She
winced
at
the
hit
;
then
said
curiously
,
``
When
did
you
see
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
was
at
Christminster
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
So

come

will
live

with

now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course

just
as
you
live
with
your

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
the
window
pots
with
the
geraniums
and
cactuses
,
*NL*
withered
for
want
of
attention
,
and
through
them
at
the
outer
*NL*
distance
,
till
her
eyes
began
to
grow
moist
.
``
What
is
it
?
''
said
*NL*
Jude
,
in
a
softened
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
you
be
so
glad
to
go
back
to
her

if
what
you
used
to
*NL*
say
to
me
is
still
true

I
mean
if
it
were
true
then
!
Of
course
it
*NL*
is
not
now
!
How
could
your
heart
go
back
to
Arabella
so
soon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
special
Providence
,
I
suppose
,
helped
it
on
its
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
--
it
is
n't
true
!
''
she
said
with
gentle
resentment
.
``
You
are
*NL*
teasing
me
--
that
's
all
--
because
you
think
I
am
not
happy
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know

I
do
n't
wish
to
know

*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
were
unhappy
it
would
be
my
fault
,
my
wickedness

not
that
*NL*
I
should
have
a
right
to
dislike
him
!
He
is
considerate
to
me
in
*NL*
everything
;
and
he
is
very
interesting
,
from
the
amount
of
general
*NL*
knowledge
he
has
acquired
by
reading
everything
that
comes
in
his
*NL*
way

Do
you
think
,
Jude
,
that
a
man
ought
to
marry
a
woman
his
*NL*
own
age
,
or
one
younger
than
himself

eighteen
years
--
as
I
am
than
*NL*
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
depends
upon
what
they
feel
for
each
other

*NL*
*NL*
He
gave
her
no
opportunity
of
self-satisfaction
,
and
she
had
to
go
on
*NL*
unaided
,
which
she
did
in
a
vanquished
tone
,
verging
on
tears
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
--
I
think
I
must
be
equally
honest
with
you
as
you
have
been
with
*NL*
me
.
Perhaps
you
have
seen
what
it
is
I
want
to
say
?
--
that
though
I
*NL*
like
Mr.
Phillotson
as
a
friend
,
I
do
n't
like
him

it
is
a
torture
to
*NL*
me
to

live
with
him
as
a
husband

There
,
now
I
have
let
it
out

I
*NL*
could
n't
help
it

I
have
been

pretending
I
am
happy

Now
*NL*
you
'll
have
a
contempt
for
me
for
ever
,
I
suppose
!
''
She
bent
down
*NL*
her
face
upon
her
hands
as
they
lay
upon
the
cloth
,
and
silently
*NL*
sobbed
in
little
jerks
that
made
the
fragile
three-legged
table
*NL*
quiver
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
only
been
married
a
month
or
two
!
''
she
went
on
,
still
*NL*
remaining
bent
upon
the
table
,
and
sobbing
into
her
hands
.
``
And
it
*NL*
is
said
that
what
a
woman
shrinks
from
--
in
the
early
days
of
her
*NL*
marriage
--
she
shakes
down
to
with
comfortable
indifference
in
half
a
*NL*
dozen
years
.
But
that
is
much
like
saying
that
the
amputation
of
a
*NL*
limb
is
no
affliction
,
since
a
person
gets
comfortably
accustomed
to
*NL*
the
use
of
a
wooden
leg
or
arm
in
the
course
of
time
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
could
hardly
speak
,
but
he
said
,
``
I
thought
there
was
something
*NL*
wrong
,
Sue
!
Oh
,
I
thought
there
was
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
is
not
as
you
think
!
--
there
is
nothing
wrong
except
my
own
*NL*
wickedness
,
I
suppose
you
'd
call
it
--
a
repugnance
on
my
part
,
for
a
*NL*
reason
I
can
not
disclose
,
and
what
would
not
be
admitted
as
one
by
*NL*
the
world
in
general
!
...
What
tortures
me
so
much
is
the
necessity
*NL*
of
being
responsive
to
this
man
whenever
he
wishes
,
good
as
he
is
*NL*
morally
!
--
the
dreadful
contract
to
feel
in
a
particular
way
in
a
*NL*
matter
whose
essence
is
its
voluntariness
!
...
I
wish
he
would
beat
*NL*
me
,
or
be
faithless
to
me
,
or
do
some
open
thing
that
I
could
talk
*NL*
about
as
a
justification
for
feeling
as
I
do
!
But
he
does
nothing
,
*NL*
except
that
he
has
grown
a
little
cold
since
he
has
found
out
how
I
*NL*
feel

That
's
why
he
did
n't
come
to
the
funeral
...
Oh
,
I
am
very
*NL*
miserable
--
I
do
n't
know
what
to
do
!
...
Do
n't
come
near
me
,
Jude
,
*NL*
because
you
must
n't
.
Do
n't
--
do
n't
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
had
jumped
up
and
put
his
face
against
hers
--
or
rather
against
*NL*
her
ear
,
her
face
being
inaccessible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
you
not
to
,
Jude
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
you
did

I
only
wish

console
you

It
all
arose
through
*NL*
my
being
married
before
we
met
,
did
n't
it
?
You
would
have
been
my
*NL*
wife
,
Sue
,
would
n't
you
,
if
it
had
n't
been
for
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Instead
of
replying
she
rose
quickly
,
and
saying
she
was
going
to
*NL*
walk
to
her
aunt
's
grave
in
the
churchyard
to
recover
herself
,
went
*NL*
out
of
the
house
.
Jude
did
not
follow
her
.
Twenty
minutes
later
he
*NL*
saw
her
cross
the
village
green
towards
Mrs.
Edlin
's
,
and
soon
she
*NL*
sent
a
little
girl
to
fetch
her
bag
,
and
tell
him
she
was
too
tired
*NL*
to
see
him
again
that
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
lonely
room
of
his
aunt
's
house
,
Jude
sat
watching
the
*NL*
cottage
of
the
Widow
Edlin
as
it
disappeared
behind
the
night
shade
.
*NL*
He
knew
that
Sue
was
sitting
within
its
walls
equally
lonely
and
*NL*
disheartened
;
and
again
questioned
his
devotional
motto
that
all
was
*NL*
for
the
best
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
retired
to
rest
early
,
but
his
sleep
was
fitful
from
the
sense
*NL*
that
Sue
was
so
near
at
hand
.
At
some
time
near
two
o'clock
,
when
*NL*
he
was
beginning
to
sleep
more
soundly
,
he
was
aroused
by
a
shrill
*NL*
squeak
that
had
been
familiar
enough
to
him
when
he
lived
regularly
*NL*
at
Marygreen
.
It
was
the
cry
of
a
rabbit
caught
in
a
gin
.
As
was
*NL*
the
little
creature
's
habit
,
it
did
not
soon
repeat
its
cry
;
and
*NL*
probably
would
not
do
so
more
than
once
or
twice
;
but
would
remain
*NL*
bearing
its
torture
till
the
morrow
when
the
trapper
would
come
and
*NL*
knock
it
on
the
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
who
in
his
childhood
had
saved
the
lives
of
the
earthworms
now
*NL*
began
to
picture
the
agonies
of
the
rabbit
from
its
lacerated
leg
.
*NL*
If
it
were
a
``
bad
catch
''
by
the
hind-leg
,
the
animal
would
tug
*NL*
during
the
ensuing
six
hours
till
the
iron
teeth
of
the
trap
had
*NL*
stripped
the
leg-bone
of
its
flesh
,
when
,
should
a
weak-springed
*NL*
instrument
enable
it
to
escape
,
it
would
die
in
the
fields
from
the
*NL*
mortification
of
the
limb
.
If
it
were
a
``
good
catch
,
''
namely
,
by
the
*NL*
fore-leg
,
the
bone
would
be
broken
and
the
limb
nearly
torn
in
two
in
*NL*
attempts
at
an
impossible
escape
.
*NL*
*NL*
Almost
half
an
hour
passed
,
and
the
rabbit
repeated
its
cry
.
Jude
*NL*
could
rest
no
longer
till
he
had
put
it
out
of
its
pain
,
so
dressing
*NL*
himself
quickly
he
descended
,
and
by
the
light
of
the
moon
went
*NL*
across
the
green
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
.
He
reached
the
hedge
*NL*
bordering
the
widow
's
garden
,
when
he
stood
still
.
The
faint
click
*NL*
of
the
trap
as
dragged
about
by
the
writhing
animal
guided
him
now
,
*NL*
and
reaching
the
spot
he
struck
the
rabbit
on
the
back
of
the
neck
*NL*
with
the
side
of
his
palm
,
and
it
stretched
itself
out
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
turning
away
when
he
saw
a
woman
looking
out
of
the
open
*NL*
casement
at
a
window
on
the
ground
floor
of
the
adjacent
cottage
.
*NL*
``
Jude
!
''
said
a
voice
timidly
--
Sue
's
voice
.
``
It
is
you
--
is
it
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
dear
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
been
able
to
sleep
at
all
,
and
then
I
heard
the
rabbit
,
*NL*
and
could
n't
help
thinking
of
what
it
suffered
,
till
I
felt
I
must
*NL*
come
down
and
kill
it
!
But
I
am
so
glad
you
got
there
first
...
They
*NL*
ought
not
to
be
allowed
to
set
these
steel
traps
,
ought
they

''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
had
reached
the
window
,
which
was
quite
a
low
one
,
so
that
she
*NL*
was
visible
down
to
her
waist
.
She
let
go
the
casement-stay
and
put
*NL*
her
hand
upon
his
,
her
moonlit
face
regarding
him
wistfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
it
keep
you
awake
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
I
was
awake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
was
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
know
--
now

I
know
you

with
your
religious
doctrines

think
*NL*
that
a
married
woman
in
trouble
of
a
kind
like
mine
commits
a
mortal
*NL*
sin
in
making
a
man
the
confidant
of
it
,
as
I
did
you
.
I
wish
I
*NL*
had
n't
,
now

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
wish
it

he
said
.
``
That
may
have
BEEN
my
view
;
but
my
*NL*
doctrines
and
I
begin
to
part
company
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
it

I

why
I
vowed

belief

I
am
SO
GLAD
to
see

did

mean
*NL*
to
see
you
again
,
now

last
tie
between

,
Aunt
Drusilla
,
is
*NL*
dead
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
seized
her
hand
and
kissed
it
.
``
There
is
a
stronger
one
left
!
''
*NL*
he
said
.
``
I
'll
never
care
about
my
doctrines
or
my
religion
any
*NL*
more
!
Let
them
go
!
Let
me
help
you
,
even
if
I
do
love
you
,
and
even
*NL*
if
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
say
it

I
know
what
you
mean

but
I
ca
n't
admit
so
much
as
*NL*
that

There

Guess
what
you
like

do

press
me
to
answer

questions

So
few
could
enter
into
my
feeling

they
would
say
*NL*
't
was
my
fanciful
fastidiousness
,
or
something
of
that
sort
,
and
*NL*
condemn
me

It
is
none
of
the
natural
tragedies

love

usual

a
tragedy
artificially

It

been

to
tell
my
*NL*
distress
to
you
,
if
I
had
been
able
to
tell
it
to
anybody
else
.
But
*NL*
I
have
nobody
.
And
I
MUST
tell
somebody
!
Jude
,
before
I
married
*NL*
him
I
had
never
thought
out
fully
what
marriage
meant
,
even
though
I
*NL*
knew
.
It
was
idiotic
of
me
--
there
is
no
excuse
.
I
was
old
enough
,
*NL*
and
I
thought
I
was
very
experienced
.
So
I
rushed
on
,
when
I
had
got
*NL*
into
that
training
school
scrape
,
with
all
the
cock-sureness
of
the
*NL*
fool
that
I
was
!
...
I
am
certain
one
ought
to
be
allowed
to
undo
*NL*
what
one
had
done
so
ignorantly
!
I
daresay
it
happens
to
lots
of
*NL*
women
,
only
they
submit
,
and
I
kick
...
When
people
of
a
later
age
*NL*
look
back
upon
the
barbarous
customs
and
superstitions
of
the
times
*NL*
that
we
have
the
unhappiness
to
live
in
,
what
WILL
they
say
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very
bitter
,
darling
Sue
!
How
I
wish
--
I
wish
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
go
in
now
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
moment
of
impulse
she
bent
over
the
sill
,
and
laid
her
face
upon
*NL*
his
hair
,
weeping
,
and
then
imprinting
a
scarcely
perceptible
little
*NL*
kiss
upon
the
top
of
his
head
,
withdrawing
quickly
,
so
that
he
could
*NL*
not
put
his
arms
round
her
,
as
otherwise
he
unquestionably
would
have
*NL*
done
.
She
shut
the
casement
,
and
he
returned
to
his
cottage
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Sue
's
distressful
confession
recurred
to
Jude
's
mind
all
the
night
as
*NL*
being
a
sorrow
indeed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
morning
after
,
when
it
was
time
for
her
to
go
,
the
neighbours
saw
*NL*
her
companion
and
herself
disappearing
on
foot
down
the
hill
path
*NL*
which
led
into
the
lonely
road
to
Alfredston
.
An
hour
passed
before
*NL*
he
returned
along
the
same
route
,
and
in
his
face
there
was
a
look
of
*NL*
exaltation
not
unmixed
with
recklessness
.
An
incident
had
occurred
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
stood
parting
in
the
silent
highway
,
and
their
tense
and
*NL*
passionate
moods
had
led
to
bewildered
inquiries
of
each
other
on
how
*NL*
far
their
intimacy
ought
to
go
;
till
they
had
almost
quarrelled
,
and
*NL*
she
said
tearfully
that
it
was
hardly
proper
of
him
as
a
parson
in
*NL*
embryo
to
think
of
such
a
thing
as
kissing
her
even
in
farewell
as
he
*NL*
now
wished
to
do
.
Then
she
had
conceded
that
the
fact
of
the
kiss
*NL*
would
be
nothing
:
all
would
depend
upon
the
spirit
of
it
.
If
given
*NL*
in
the
spirit
of
a
cousin
and
a
friend
she
saw
no
objection
:
if
in
*NL*
the
spirit
of
a
lover
she
could
not
permit
it
.
``
Will
you
swear
that
*NL*
it
will
not
be
in
that
spirit
?
''
she
had
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
:
he
would
not
.
And
then
they
had
turned
from
each
other
in
*NL*
estrangement
,
and
gone
their
several
ways
,
till
at
a
distance
*NL*
of
twenty
or
thirty
yards
both
had
looked
round
simultaneously
.
*NL*
That
look
behind
was
fatal
to
the
reserve
hitherto
more
or
less
*NL*
maintained
.
They
had
quickly
run
back
,
and
met
,
and
embracing
most
*NL*
unpremeditatedly
,
kissed
close
and
long
.
When
they
parted
for
good
*NL*
it
was
with
flushed
cheeks
on
her
side
,
and
a
beating
heart
on
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
kiss
was
a
turning-point
in
Jude
's
career
.
Back
again
in
the
*NL*
cottage
,
and
left
to
reflection
,
he
saw
one
thing
:
that
though
*NL*
his
kiss
of
that
aerial
being
had
seemed
the
purest
moment
of
his
*NL*
faultful
life
,
as
long
as
he
nourished
this
unlicensed
tenderness
it
*NL*
was
glaringly
inconsistent
for
him
to
pursue
the
idea
of
becoming
the
*NL*
soldier
and
servant
of
a
religion
in
which
sexual
love
was
regarded
*NL*
as
at
its
best
a
frailty
,
and
at
its
worst
damnation
.
What
Sue
*NL*
had
said
in
warmth
was
really
the
cold
truth
.
When
to
defend
*NL*
his
affection
tooth
and
nail
,
to
persist
with
headlong
force
in
*NL*
impassioned
attentions
to
her
,
was
all
he
thought
of
,
he
was
*NL*
condemned
_
ipso
facto
_
as
a
professor
of
the
accepted
school
of
*NL*
morals
.
He
was
as
unfit
,
obviously
,
by
nature
,
as
he
had
been
by
*NL*
social
position
,
to
fill
the
part
of
a
propounder
of
accredited
*NL*
dogma
.
*NL*
*NL*
Strange
that
his
first
aspiration
--
towards
academical
*NL*
proficiency
--
had
been
checked
by
a
woman
,
and
that
his
second
*NL*
aspiration
--
towards
apostleship
--
had
also
been
checked
by
a
woman
.
*NL*
``
Is
it
,
''
he
said
,
``
that
the
women
are
to
blame
;
or
is
it
the
*NL*
artificial
system
of
things
,
under
which
the
normal
sex-impulses
are
*NL*
turned
into
devilish
domestic
gins
and
springs
to
noose
and
hold
back
*NL*
those
who
want
to
progress
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
been
his
standing
desire
to
become
a
prophet
,
however
humble
,
*NL*
to
his
struggling
fellow-creatures
,
without
any
thought
of
personal
*NL*
gain
.
Yet
with
a
wife
living
away
from
him
with
another
husband
,
and
*NL*
himself
in
love
erratically
,
the
loved
one
's
revolt
against
her
state
*NL*
being
possibly
on
his
account
,
he
had
sunk
to
be
barely
respectable
*NL*
according
to
regulation
views
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
for
him
to
consider
further
:
he
had
only
to
confront
the
*NL*
obvious
,
which
was
that
he
had
made
himself
quite
an
impostor
as
a
*NL*
law-abiding
religious
teacher
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
dusk
that
evening
he
went
into
the
garden
and
dug
a
shallow
hole
,
*NL*
to
which
he
brought
out
all
the
theological
and
ethical
works
that
*NL*
he
possessed
,
and
had
stored
here
.
He
knew
that
,
in
this
country
of
*NL*
true
believers
,
most
of
them
were
not
saleable
at
a
much
higher
price
*NL*
than
waste-paper
value
,
and
preferred
to
get
rid
of
them
in
his
own
*NL*
way
,
even
if
he
should
sacrifice
a
little
money
to
the
sentiment
of
*NL*
thus
destroying
them
.
Lighting
some
loose
pamphlets
to
begin
with
,
*NL*
he
cut
the
volumes
into
pieces
as
well
as
he
could
,
and
with
a
*NL*
three-pronged
fork
shook
them
over
the
flames
.
They
kindled
,
and
*NL*
lighted
up
the
back
of
the
house
,
the
pigsty
,
and
his
own
face
,
till
*NL*
they
were
more
or
less
consumed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
he
was
almost
a
stranger
here
now
,
passing
cottagers
talked
to
*NL*
him
over
the
garden
hedge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Burning
up
your
awld
aunt
's
rubbidge
,
I
suppose
?
Ay
;
a
lot
gets
*NL*
heaped
up
in
nooks
and
corners
when
you
've
lived
eighty
years
in
one
*NL*
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
nearly
one
o'clock
in
the
morning
before
the
leaves
,
covers
,
*NL*
and
binding
of
Jeremy
Taylor
,
Butler
,
Doddridge
,
Paley
,
Pusey
,
Newman
*NL*
and
the
rest
had
gone
to
ashes
,
but
the
night
was
quiet
,
and
as
he
*NL*
turned
and
turned
the
paper
shreds
with
the
fork
,
the
sense
of
being
*NL*
no
longer
a
hypocrite
to
himself
afforded
his
mind
a
relief
which
*NL*
gave
him
calm
.
He
might
go
on
believing
as
before
,
but
he
professed
*NL*
nothing
,
and
no
longer
owned
and
exhibited
engines
of
faith
which
,
*NL*
as
their
proprietor
,
he
might
naturally
be
supposed
to
exercise
on
*NL*
himself
first
of
all
.
In
his
passion
for
Sue
he
could
not
stand
as
*NL*
an
ordinary
sinner
,
and
not
as
a
whited
sepulchre
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
Sue
,
after
parting
from
him
earlier
in
the
day
,
had
gone
*NL*
along
to
the
station
,
with
tears
in
her
eyes
for
having
run
back
and
*NL*
let
him
kiss
her
.
Jude
ought
not
to
have
pretended
that
he
was
not
a
*NL*
lover
,
and
made
her
give
way
to
an
impulse
to
act
unconventionally
,
*NL*
if
not
wrongly
.
She
was
inclined
to
call
it
the
latter
;
for
Sue
's
*NL*
logic
was
extraordinarily
compounded
,
and
seemed
to
maintain
that
*NL*
before
a
thing
was
done
it
might
be
right
to
do
,
but
that
being
done
*NL*
it
became
wrong
;
or
,
in
other
words
,
that
things
which
were
right
in
*NL*
theory
were
wrong
in
practice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
too
weak
,
I
think
!
''
she
jerked
out
as
she
pranced
on
,
*NL*
shaking
down
tear-drops
now
and
then
.
``
It
was
burning
,
like
a
*NL*
lover
's
--
oh
,
it
was
!
And
I
wo
n't
write
to
him
any
more
,
or
at
least
*NL*
for
a
long
time
,
to
impress
him
with
my
dignity
!
And
I
hope
it
will
*NL*
hurt
him
very
much
--
expecting
a
letter
to-morrow
morning
,
and
the
*NL*
next
,
and
the
next
,
and
no
letter
coming
.
He
'll
suffer
then
with
*NL*
suspense
--
wo
n't
he
,
that
's
all
!
--
and
I
am
very
glad
of
it
!
''
--
Tears
*NL*
of
pity
for
Jude
's
approaching
sufferings
at
her
hands
mingled
with
*NL*
those
which
had
surged
up
in
pity
for
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
slim
little
wife
of
a
husband
whose
person
was
disagreeable
*NL*
to
her
,
the
ethereal
,
fine-nerved
,
sensitive
girl
,
quite
unfitted
by
*NL*
temperament
and
instinct
to
fulfil
the
conditions
of
the
matrimonial
*NL*
relation
with
Phillotson
,
possibly
with
scarce
any
man
,
walked
*NL*
fitfully
along
,
and
panted
,
and
brought
weariness
into
her
eyes
by
*NL*
gazing
and
worrying
hopelessly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Phillotson
met
her
at
the
arrival
station
,
and
,
seeing
that
she
was
*NL*
troubled
,
thought
it
must
be
owing
to
the
depressing
effect
of
her
*NL*
aunt
's
death
and
funeral
.
He
began
telling
her
of
his
day
's
doings
,
*NL*
and
how
his
friend
Gillingham
,
a
neighbouring
schoolmaster
whom
he
*NL*
had
not
seen
for
years
,
had
called
upon
him
.
While
ascending
to
the
*NL*
town
,
seated
on
the
top
of
the
omnibus
beside
him
,
she
said
suddenly
*NL*
and
with
an
air
of
self-chastisement
,
regarding
the
white
road
and
*NL*
its
bordering
bushes
of
hazel
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Richard
--
I
let
Mr.
Fawley
hold
my
hand
a
long
while
.
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
whether
you
think
it
wrong
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
,
waking
apparently
from
thoughts
of
far
different
mould
,
said
*NL*
vaguely
,
``
Oh
,
did
you
?
What
did
you
do
that
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
He
wanted
to
,
and
I
let
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
it
pleased
him
.
I
should
think
it
was
hardly
a
novelty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
lapsed
into
silence
.
Had
this
been
a
case
in
the
court
of
an
*NL*
omniscient
judge
,
he
might
have
entered
on
his
notes
the
curious
fact
*NL*
that
Sue
had
placed
the
minor
for
the
major
indiscretion
,
and
had
not
*NL*
said
a
word
about
the
kiss
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
tea
that
evening
Phillotson
sat
balancing
the
school
registers
.
*NL*
She
remained
in
an
unusually
silent
,
tense
,
and
restless
condition
,
*NL*
and
at
last
,
saying
she
was
tired
,
went
to
bed
early
.
When
*NL*
Phillotson
arrived
upstairs
,
weary
with
the
drudgery
of
the
*NL*
attendance-numbers
,
it
was
a
quarter
to
twelve
o'clock
.
Entering
*NL*
their
chamber
,
which
by
day
commanded
a
view
of
some
thirty
or
forty
*NL*
miles
over
the
Vale
of
Blackmoor
,
and
even
into
Outer
Wessex
,
he
went
*NL*
to
the
window
,
and
,
pressing
his
face
against
the
pane
,
gazed
with
*NL*
hard-breathing
fixity
into
the
mysterious
darkness
which
now
covered
*NL*
the
far-reaching
scene
.
He
was
musing
,
``
I
think
,
''
he
said
at
last
,
*NL*
without
turning
his
head
,
``
that
I
must
get
the
committee
to
change
*NL*
the
school-stationer
.
All
the
copybooks
are
sent
wrong
this
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
reply
.
Thinking
Sue
was
dozing
he
went
on
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
there
must
be
a
rearrangement
of
that
ventilator
in
the
*NL*
class-room
.
The
wind
blows
down
upon
my
head
unmercifully
and
gives
*NL*
me
the
ear-ache
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
silence
seemed
more
absolute
than
ordinarily
he
turned
round
.
*NL*
The
heavy
,
gloomy
oak
wainscot
,
which
extended
over
the
walls
*NL*
upstairs
and
down
in
the
dilapidated
``
Old-Grove
Place
,
''
and
the
*NL*
massive
chimney-piece
reaching
to
the
ceiling
,
stood
in
odd
contrast
*NL*
to
the
new
and
shining
brass
bedstead
,
and
the
new
suite
of
birch
*NL*
furniture
that
he
had
bought
for
her
,
the
two
styles
seeming
to
nod
*NL*
to
each
other
across
three
centuries
upon
the
shaking
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Soo
!
''
he
said
-LRB-
this
being
the
way
in
which
he
pronounced
her
name
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
not
in
the
bed
,
though
she
had
apparently
been
there
--
the
*NL*
clothes
on
her
side
being
flung
back
.
Thinking
she
might
have
*NL*
forgotten
some
kitchen
detail
and
gone
downstairs
for
a
moment
to
*NL*
see
to
it
,
he
pulled
off
his
coat
and
idled
quietly
enough
for
a
*NL*
few
minutes
,
when
,
finding
she
did
not
come
,
he
went
out
upon
the
*NL*
landing
,
candle
in
hand
,
and
said
again
``
Soo
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
!
''
came
back
to
him
in
her
voice
,
from
the
distant
kitchen
*NL*
quarter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
doing
down
there
at
midnight
--
tiring
yourself
out
for
*NL*
nothing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
sleepy
;
I
am
reading
;
and
there
is
a
larger
fire
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
to
bed
.
Some
time
in
the
night
he
awoke
.
She
was
not
there
,
*NL*
even
now
.
Lighting
a
candle
he
hastily
stepped
out
upon
the
landing
,
*NL*
and
again
called
her
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
answered
``
Yes
!
''
as
before
,
but
the
tones
were
small
and
confined
,
*NL*
and
whence
they
came
he
could
not
at
first
understand
.
Under
the
*NL*
staircase
was
a
large
clothes-closet
,
without
a
window
;
they
seemed
*NL*
to
come
from
it
.
The
door
was
shut
,
but
there
was
no
lock
or
other
*NL*
fastening
.
Phillotson
,
alarmed
,
went
towards
it
,
wondering
if
she
*NL*
had
suddenly
become
deranged
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
doing
in
there
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
to
disturb
you
I
came
here
,
as
it
was
so
late
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
there
's
no
bed
,
is
there
?
And
no
ventilation
!
Why
,
you
'll
be
*NL*
suffocated
if
you
stay
all
night
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
I
think
not
.
Do
n't
trouble
about
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
--
''
Phillotson
seized
the
knob
and
pulled
at
the
door
.
She
had
*NL*
fastened
it
inside
with
a
piece
of
string
,
which
broke
at
his
pull
.
*NL*
There
being
no
bedstead
she
had
flung
down
some
rugs
and
made
a
*NL*
little
nest
for
herself
in
the
very
cramped
quarters
the
closet
*NL*
afforded
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
looked
in
upon
her
she
sprang
out
of
her
lair
,
great-eyed
and
*NL*
trembling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ought
not
to
have
pulled
open
the
door
!
''
she
cried
excitedly
.
*NL*
``
It
is
not
becoming
in
you
!
Oh
,
will
you
go
away
;
please
will
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
so
pitiful
and
pleading
in
her
white
nightgown
against
the
*NL*
shadowy
lumber-hole
that
he
was
quite
worried
.
She
continued
to
*NL*
beseech
him
not
to
disturb
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
:
``
I
've
been
kind
to
you
,
and
given
you
every
liberty
;
and
it
*NL*
is
monstrous
that
you
should
feel
in
this
way
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
she
,
weeping
.
``
I
know
that
!
It
is
wrong
and
wicked
of
*NL*
me
,
I
suppose
!
I
am
very
sorry
.
But
it
is
not
I
altogether
that
am
*NL*
to
blame
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
then
?
Am
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
I
do
n't
know
!
The
universe
,
I
suppose
--
things
in
general
,
*NL*
because
they
are
so
horrid
and
cruel
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
is
no
use
talking
like
that
.
Making
a
man
's
house
so
*NL*
unseemly
at
this
time
o
'
night
!
Eliza
will
hear
if
we
do
n't
mind
.
''
*NL*
-LRB-
He
meant
the
servant
.
-RRB-
``
Just
think
if
either
of
the
parsons
in
this
*NL*
town
was
to
see
us
now
!
I
hate
such
eccentricities
,
Sue
.
There
's
no
*NL*
order
or
regularity
in
your
sentiments
!
...
But
I
wo
n't
intrude
on
*NL*
you
further
;
only
I
would
advise
you
not
to
shut
the
door
too
tight
,
*NL*
or
I
shall
find
you
stifled
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
rising
the
next
morning
he
immediately
looked
into
the
closet
,
but
*NL*
Sue
had
already
gone
downstairs
.
There
was
a
little
nest
where
she
*NL*
had
lain
,
and
spiders
'
webs
hung
overhead
.
``
What
must
a
woman
's
*NL*
aversion
be
when
it
is
stronger
than
her
fear
of
spiders
!
''
he
said
*NL*
bitterly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
found
her
sitting
at
the
breakfast-table
,
and
the
meal
began
*NL*
almost
in
silence
,
the
burghers
walking
past
upon
the
pavement
--
or
*NL*
rather
roadway
,
pavements
being
scarce
here
--
which
was
two
or
three
*NL*
feet
above
the
level
of
the
parlour
floor
.
They
nodded
down
to
the
*NL*
happy
couple
their
morning
greetings
,
as
they
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Richard
,
''
she
said
all
at
once
;
``
would
you
mind
my
living
away
from
*NL*
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Away
from
me
?
Why
,
that
's
what
you
were
doing
when
I
married
you
.
*NL*
What
then
was
the
meaning
of
marrying
at
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
n't
like
me
any
the
better
for
telling
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
object
to
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
thought
I
could
do
nothing
else
.
You
had
got
my
promise
a
*NL*
long
time
before
that
,
remember
.
Then
,
as
time
went
on
,
I
regretted
*NL*
I
had
promised
you
,
and
was
trying
to
see
an
honourable
way
to
break
*NL*
it
off
.
But
as
I
could
n't
I
became
rather
reckless
and
careless
*NL*
about
the
conventions
.
Then
you
know
what
scandals
were
spread
,
and
*NL*
how
I
was
turned
out
of
the
training
school
you
had
taken
such
time
*NL*
and
trouble
to
prepare
me
for
and
get
me
into
;
and
this
frightened
*NL*
me
and
it
seemed
then
that
the
one
thing
I
could
do
would
be
to
let
*NL*
the
engagement
stand
.
Of
course
I
,
of
all
people
,
ought
not
to
have
*NL*
cared
what
was
said
,
for
it
was
just
what
I
fancied
I
never
did
care
*NL*
for
.
But
I
was
a
coward
--
as
so
many
women
are
--
and
my
theoretic
*NL*
unconventionality
broke
down
.
If
that
had
not
entered
into
the
case
*NL*
it
would
have
been
better
to
have
hurt
your
feelings
once
for
all
*NL*
then
,
than
to
marry
you
and
hurt
them
all
my
life
after
...
And
you
*NL*
were
so
generous
in
never
giving
credit
for
a
moment
to
the
rumour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
bound
in
honesty
to
tell
you
that
I
weighed
its
probability
and
*NL*
inquired
of
your
cousin
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
she
said
with
pained
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
doubt
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
inquired

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
took
his
word

''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
eyes
had
filled
.
``
HE
would
n't
have
inquired
!
''
she
said
.
*NL*
``
But
you
have
n't
answered
me

Will
you
let
me
go
away

I
know
how

irregular
it
is
of
me
to
ask
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
irregular
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
do
ask
it
!
Domestic
laws
should
be
made
according
to
*NL*
temperaments
,
which
should
be
classified
.
If
people
are
at
all
*NL*
peculiar
in
character
they
have
to
suffer
from
the
very
rules
that
*NL*
produce
comfort
in
others
!
...
Will
you
let
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
we
married

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
use
of
thinking
of
laws
and
ordinances

''
she
burst
out
,
*NL*
``
if
they
make
you
miserable
when
you
know
you
are
committing
no
sin

*NL*
*NL*
``

you
are
committing
a
sin
in
not
liking

*NL*
*NL*
``

But
I
did

reflect
it

so
much
more
than
that
...
For
a
man
and
woman
to
live
on
intimate
*NL*
terms
when
one
feels
as
I
do
is
adultery
,
in
any
circumstances

You

such
importunity

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

we
agree
to
free
each

We
made
the
compact

*NL*
surely
we
can
cancel
it
--
not
legally
of
course
;
but
we
can
morally
,
*NL*
especially
as
no
new
interests
,
in
the
shape
of
children

have
arisen
*NL*
to
be
looked

Then
we
might
be

without

Oh
Richard

be
my
friend

We
shall
both
be

dead

years

then
what
will
it
matter
to
anybody
that
you
*NL*
relieved

from
constraint
for
a
little
while

I

me
eccentric

super-sensitive

something
absurd

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

bind

always
as

silly

And

Phillotson
writhed

once
occurred

*NL*
*NL*
The
ringing
of
the
school
bell
saved
Phillotson
from
the
necessity
of
*NL*
replying
at
present
to
what
apparently
did
not
strike
him
as
being
*NL*
such
a
convincing
_
argumentum
ad
verecundiam
_
as
she
,
in
her
loss
of
*NL*
courage
at
the
last
moment
,
meant
it
to
appear
.
She
was
beginning
to
*NL*
be
so
puzzling
and
unstateable
that
he
was
ready
to
throw
in
with
her
*NL*
other
little
peculiarities
the
extremest
request
which
a
wife
could
*NL*
make
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
proceeded
to
the
schools
that
morning
as
usual
,
Sue
entering
*NL*
the
class-room
,
where
he
could
see
the
back
of
her
head
through
the
*NL*
glass
partition
whenever
he
turned
his
eyes
that
way
.
As
he
went
on
*NL*
giving
and
hearing
lessons
his
forehead
and
eyebrows
twitched
from
*NL*
concentrated
agitation
of
thought
,
till
at
length
he
tore
a
scrap
*NL*
from
a
sheet
of
scribbling
paper
and
wrote
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Your
request
prevents
my
attending
to
work
at
all
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
what
I
am
doing
!
Was
it
seriously
made
?
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
folded
the
piece
of
paper
very
small
,
and
gave
it
to
a
little
*NL*
boy
to
take
to
Sue
.
The
child
toddled
off
into
the
class-room
.
*NL*
Phillotson
saw
his
wife
turn
and
take
the
note
,
and
the
bend
of
her
*NL*
pretty
head
as
she
read
it
,
her
lips
slightly
crisped
,
to
prevent
*NL*
undue
expression
under
fire
of
so
many
young
eyes
.
He
could
not
see
*NL*
her
hands
,
but
she
changed
her
position
,
and
soon
the
child
returned
,
*NL*
bringing
nothing
in
reply
.
In
a
few
minutes
,
however
,
one
of
Sue
's
*NL*
class
appeared
,
with
a
little
note
similar
to
his
own
.
These
words
*NL*
only
were
pencilled
therein
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
sincerely
sorry
to
say
that
it
was
seriously
made
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Phillotson
looked
more
disturbed
than
before
,
and
the
meeting-place
*NL*
of
his
brows
twitched
again
.
In
ten
minutes
he
called
up
the
child
*NL*
he
had
just
sent
to
her
,
and
dispatched
another
missive
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
God
knows
I
do
n't
want
to
thwart
you
in
any
reasonable
way
.
*NL*
My
whole
thought
is
to
make
you
comfortable
and
happy
.
But
*NL*
I
can
not
agree
to
such
a
preposterous
notion
as
your
going
*NL*
to
live
with
your
lover
.
You
would
lose
everybody
's
respect
*NL*
and
regard
;
and
so
should
I
!
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
After
an
interval
a
similar
part
was
enacted
in
the
class-room
,
and
*NL*
an
answer
came
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
know
you
mean
my
good
.
But
I
do
n't
want
to
be
respectable
!
*NL*
To
produce
``
Human
development
in
its
richest
diversity
''
-LRB-
to
*NL*
quote
your
Humboldt
-RRB-
is
to
my
mind
far
above
respectability
.
*NL*
No
doubt
my
tastes
are
low
--
in
your
view
--
hopelessly
low
!
*NL*
If
you
won
t
let
me
go
to
him
,
will
you
grant
me
this
one
*NL*
request
--
allow
me
to
live
in
your
house
in
a
separate
way
?
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
he
returned
no
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
wrote
again
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
know
what
you
think
.
But
can
not
you
have
pity
on
me
?
I
beg
*NL*
you
to
;
I
implore
you
to
be
merciful
!
I
would
not
ask
if
I
*NL*
were
not
almost
compelled
by
what
I
ca
n't
bear
!
No
poor
woman
*NL*
has
ever
wished
more
than
I
that
Eve
had
not
fallen
,
so
that
*NL*
-LRB-
as
the
primitive
Christians
believed
-RRB-
some
harmless
mode
of
*NL*
vegetation
might
have
peopled
Paradise
.
But
I
wo
n't
trifle
!
*NL*
Be
kind
to
me
--
even
though
I
have
not
been
kind
to
you
!
I
*NL*
will
go
away
,

abroad

anywhere

and
never
trouble
you

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Nearly
an
hour
passed
,
and
then
he
returned
an
answer
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
not
wish
to
pain
you
.
How
well
you
KNOW
I
do
n't
!
Give
me
*NL*
a
little
time
.
I
am
disposed
to
agree
to
your
last
request
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
One
line
from
her
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Thank
you
from
my
heart
,
Richard
.
I
do
not
deserve
your
*NL*
kindness
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
All
day
Phillotson
bent
a
dazed
regard
upon
her
through
the
glazed
*NL*
partition
;
and
he
felt
as
lonely
as
when
he
had
not
known
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
was
as
good
as
his
word
,
and
consented
to
her
living
apart
*NL*
in
the
house
.
At
first
,
when
they
met
at
meals
,
she
had
seemed
*NL*
more
composed
under
the
new
arrangement
;
but
the
irksomeness
of
*NL*
their
position
worked
on
her
temperament
,
and
the
fibres
of
her
*NL*
nature
seemed
strained
like
harp-strings
.
She
talked
vaguely
and
*NL*
indiscriminately
to
prevent
his
talking
pertinently
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Phillotson
was
sitting
up
late
,
as
was
often
his
custom
,
trying
to
*NL*
get
together
the
materials
for
his
long-neglected
hobby
of
Roman
*NL*
antiquities
.
For
the
first
time
since
reviving
the
subject
he
felt
a
*NL*
return
of
his
old
interest
in
it
.
He
forgot
time
and
place
,
and
when
*NL*
he
remembered
himself
and
ascended
to
rest
it
was
nearly
two
o'clock
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
preoccupation
was
such
that
,
though
he
now
slept
on
the
other
*NL*
side
of
the
house
,
he
mechanically
went
to
the
room
that
he
and
his
*NL*
wife
had
occupied
when
he
first
became
a
tenant
of
Old-Grove
Place
,
*NL*
which
since
his
differences
with
Sue
had
been
hers
exclusively
.
*NL*
He
entered
,
and
unconsciously
began
to
undress
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
cry
from
the
bed
,
and
a
quick
movement
.
Before
the
*NL*
schoolmaster
had
realized
where
he
was
he
perceived
Sue
starting
up
*NL*
half-awake
,
staring
wildly
,
and
springing
out
upon
the
floor
on
the
*NL*
side
away
from
him
,
which
was
towards
the
window
.
This
was
somewhat
*NL*
hidden
by
the
canopy
of
the
bedstead
,
and
in
a
moment
he
heard
her
*NL*
flinging
up
the
sash
.
Before
he
had
thought
that
she
meant
to
do
*NL*
more
than
get
air
she
had
mounted
upon
the
sill
and
leapt
out
.
She
*NL*
disappeared
in
the
darkness
,
and
he
heard
her
fall
below
.
*NL*
*NL*
Phillotson
,
horrified
,
ran
downstairs
,
striking
himself
sharply
*NL*
against
the
newel
in
his
haste
.
Opening
the
heavy
door
he
ascended
*NL*
the
two
or
three
steps
to
the
level
of
the
ground
,
and
there
on
the
*NL*
gravel
before
him
lay
a
white
heap
.
Phillotson
seized
it
in
his
*NL*
arms
,
and
bringing
Sue
into
the
hall
seated
her
on
a
chair
,
where
he
*NL*
gazed
at
her
by
the
flapping
light
of
the
candle
which
he
had
set
*NL*
down
in
the
draught
on
the
bottom
stair
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
certainly
not
broken
her
neck
.
She
looked
at
him
with
eyes
*NL*
that
seemed
not
to
take
him
in
;
and
though
not
particularly
large
in
*NL*
general
they
appeared
so
now
.
She
pressed
her
side
and
rubbed
her
*NL*
arm
,
as
if
conscious
of
pain
;
then
stood
up
,
averting
her
face
,
in
*NL*
evident
distress
at
his
gaze
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
God
--
you
are
not
killed
!
Though
it
's
not
for
want
of
*NL*
trying
--
not
much
hurt
I
hope
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
fall
,
in
fact
,
had
not
been
a
serious
one
,
probably
owing
to
the
*NL*
lowness
of
the
old
rooms
and
to
the
high
level
of
the
ground
without
.
*NL*
Beyond
a
scraped
elbow
and
a
blow
in
the
side
she
had
apparently
*NL*
incurred
little
harm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
asleep
,
I
think
!
''
she
began
,
her
pale
face
still
turned
away
*NL*
from
him
.
``
And
something
frightened
me
--
a
terrible
dream
--
I
thought
*NL*
I
saw
you
--
''
The
actual
circumstances
seemed
to
come
back
to
her
,
*NL*
and
she
was
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
cloak
was
hanging
at
the
back
of
the
door
,
and
the
wretched
*NL*
Phillotson
flung
it
round
her
.
``
Shall
I
help
you
upstairs
?
''
he
asked
*NL*
drearily
;
for
the
significance
of
all
this
sickened
him
of
himself
*NL*
and
of
everything
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
thank
you
,
Richard
.
I
am
very
little
hurt
.
I
can
walk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ought
to
lock
your
door
,
''
he
mechanically
said
,
as
if
lecturing
*NL*
in
school
.
``
Then
no
one
could
intrude
even
by
accident
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
tried
--
it
wo
n't
lock
.
All
the
doors
are
out
of
order
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
aspect
of
things
was
not
improved
by
her
admission
.
She
ascended
*NL*
the
staircase
slowly
,
the
waving
light
of
the
candle
shining
on
her
.
*NL*
Phillotson
did
not
approach
her
,
or
attempt
to
ascend
himself
till
he
*NL*
heard
her
enter
her
room
.
Then
he
fastened
up
the
front
door
,
and
*NL*
returning
,
sat
down
on
the
lower
stairs
,
holding
the
newel
with
one
*NL*
hand
,
and
bowing
his
face
into
the
other
.
Thus
he
remained
for
a
*NL*
long
long
time
--
a
pitiable
object
enough
to
one
who
had
seen
him
;
*NL*
till
,
raising
his
head
and
sighing
a
sigh
which
seemed
to
say
that
*NL*
the
business
of
his
life
must
be
carried
on
,
whether
he
had
a
wife
or
*NL*
no
,
he
took
the
candle
and
went
upstairs
to
his
lonely
room
on
the
*NL*
other
side
of
the
landing
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
further
incident
touching
the
matter
between
them
occurred
till
*NL*
the
following
evening
,
when
,
immediately
school
was
over
,
Phillotson
*NL*
walked
out
of
Shaston
,
saying
he
required
no
tea
,
and
not
informing
*NL*
Sue
where
he
was
going
.
He
descended
from
the
town
level
by
a
steep
*NL*
road
in
a
north-westerly
direction
,
and
continued
to
move
downwards
*NL*
till
the
soil
changed
from
its
white
dryness
to
a
tough
brown
clay
.
*NL*
He
was
now
on
the
low
alluvial
beds
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Where
Duncliffe
is
the
traveller
's
mark
,
*NL*
And
cloty
Stour
's
a-rolling
dark
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
More
than
once
he
looked
back
in
the
increasing
obscurity
of
evening
.
*NL*
Against
the
sky
was
Shaston
,
dimly
visible
*NL*
*NL*

On
the
grey-topp

*NL*
*NL*
The
new-lit
lights
from
its
windows
burnt
with
a
steady
shine
as
if
*NL*
watching
him
,
one
of
which
windows
was
his
own
.
Above
it
he
could
*NL*
just
discern
the
pinnacled
tower
of
Trinity
Church
.
The
air
down
*NL*
here
,
tempered
by
the
thick
damp
bed
of
tenacious
clay
,
was
not
as
it
*NL*
had
been
above
,
but
soft
and
relaxing
,
so
that
when
he
had
walked
a
*NL*
mile
or
two
he
was
obliged
to
wipe
his
face
with
his
handkerchief
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leaving
Duncliffe
Hill
on
the
left
he
proceeded
without
hesitation
*NL*
through
the
shade
,
as
a
man
goes
on
,
night
or
day
,
in
a
district
over
*NL*
which
he
has
played
as
a
boy
.
He
had
walked
altogether
about
four
*NL*
and
a
half
miles

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
when
he
crossed
a
tributary
of
the
Stour
,
and
reached
Leddenton
--
a
*NL*
little
town
of
three
or
four
thousand
inhabitants
--
where
he
went
*NL*
on
to
the
boys
'
school
,
and
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
master
's
*NL*
residence
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
boy
pupil-teacher
opened
it
,
and
to
Phillotson
's
inquiry
if
Mr.
*NL*
Gillingham
was
at
home
,
replied
that
he
was
,
going
at
once
off
to
his
*NL*
own
house
,
and
leaving
Phillotson
to
find
his
way
in
as
he
could
.
He
*NL*
discovered
his
friend
putting
away
some
books
from
which
he
had
been
*NL*
giving
evening
lessons
.
The
light
of
the
paraffin
lamp
fell
on
*NL*
Phillotson
's
face
--
pale
and
wretched
by
contrast
with
his
friend
's
,
*NL*
who
had
a
cool
,
practical
look
.
They
had
been
schoolmates
in
*NL*
boyhood
,
and
fellow-students
at
Wintoncester
Training
College
,
many
*NL*
years
before
this
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Glad
to
see
you
,
Dick
!
But
you
do
n't
look
well
!
Nothing
the
*NL*
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Phillotson
advanced
without
replying
,
and
Gillingham
closed
the
*NL*
cupboard
and
pulled
up
beside
his
visitor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
you
have
n't
been
here
--
let
me
see
--
since
you
were
married
?
*NL*
I
called
,
you
know
,
but
you
were
out
;
and
upon
my
word
it
is
such
a
*NL*
climb
after
dark
that
I
have
been
waiting
till
the
days
are
longer
*NL*
before
lumpering
up
again
.
I
am
glad
you
did

wait

however

*NL*
Though
well-trained
and
even
proficient
masters
,
they
occasionally
*NL*
used
a
dialect-word
of
their
boyhood
to
each
other
in
private
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
come
,
George
,
to
explain
to
you
my
reasons
for
taking
a
step
*NL*
that
I
am
about
to
take
,
so
that
you
,
at

,
will
understand
my
*NL*
motives
if
other
people
question
them
anywhen

as
they
may
,
indeed
*NL*
certainly
will
...
But
anything
is
better
than
the
present
condition
*NL*
of
things
.
God
forbid
that
you
should
ever
have
such
an
experience
*NL*
as
mine

*NL*
*NL*
``
Sit
down

You
do

anything

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
sad
part
of
it
is
that
she
is
not
so
much
to
blame
as
I
.
She
*NL*
was
a
pupil-teacher
under
me
,
as
you
know
,
and
I
took
advantage
of
*NL*
her
inexperience
,
and
toled
her
out
for
walks
,
and
got
her
to
agree
*NL*
to
a
long
engagement
before
she
well
knew
her
own
mind
.
Afterwards
*NL*
she
saw
somebody
else
,
but
she
blindly
fulfilled
her
engagement
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Loving
the
other
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
with
a
curious
tender
solicitude
seemingly
;
though
her
exact
*NL*
feeling
for
him
is
a
riddle
to
me
--
and
to
him
too
,
I
think
--
possibly
*NL*
to
herself
.
She
is
one
of
the
oddest
creatures
I
ever
met
.
However
,
*NL*
I
have
been
struck
with
these
two
facts
;
the
extraordinary
sympathy
,
*NL*
or
similarity
,
between
the
pair
.
He
is
her
cousin
,
which
perhaps
*NL*
accounts
for
some
of
it
.
They
seem
to
be
one
person
split
in
two
!
*NL*
And
with
her
unconquerable
aversion
to
myself
as
a
husband
,
even
*NL*
though
she
may
like
me
as
a
friend
,
't
is
too
much
to
bear
longer
.
*NL*
She
has
conscientiously
struggled
against
it
,
but
to
no
purpose
.
*NL*
I
can
not
bear
it
--
I
can
not
!
I
ca
n't
answer
her
arguments
--
she
has
*NL*
read
ten
times
as
much
as
I
.
Her
intellect
sparkles
like
diamonds
,
*NL*
while
mine
smoulders
like
brown
paper
...
She
's
one
too
many
for
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
'll
get
over
it
,
good-now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
!
It
is
--
but
I
wo
n't
go
into
it
--
there
are
reasons
why
she
*NL*
never
will
.
At
last
she
calmly
and
firmly
asked
if
she
might
leave
*NL*
me
and
go
to
him
.
The
climax
came
last
night
,
when
,
owing
to
my
*NL*
entering
her
room
by
accident
,
she
jumped
out
of
window
--
so
strong
*NL*
was
her
dread
of
me
!
She
pretended
it
was
a
dream
,
but
that
was
*NL*
to
soothe
me
.
Now
when
a
woman
jumps
out
of
window
without
caring
*NL*
whether
she
breaks
her
neck
or
no
,
she
's
not
to
be
mistaken
;
and
this
*NL*
being
the
case
I
have
come
to
a
conclusion
:
that
it
is
wrong
to
so
*NL*
torture
a
fellow-creature
any
longer
;
and
I
wo
n't
be
the
inhuman
*NL*
wretch
to
do
it
,
cost
what
it
may
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
--
you
'll
let
her
go
?
And
with
her
lover
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whom
with
is
her
matter
.
I
shall
let
her
go
;
with
him
certainly
,
*NL*
if
she
wishes
.
I
know
I
may
be
wrong
--
I
know
I
ca
n't
logically
,
*NL*
or
religiously
,
defend
my
concession
to
such
a
wish
of
hers
,
or
*NL*
harmonize
it
with
the
doctrines
I
was
brought
up
in
.
Only
I
know
one
*NL*
thing
:
something
within
me
tells
me
I
am
doing
wrong
in
refusing
*NL*
her
.
I
,
like
other
men
,
profess
to
hold
that
if
a
husband
gets
such
*NL*
a
so-called
preposterous
request
from
his
wife
,
the
only
course
that
*NL*
can
possibly
be
regarded
as
right
and
proper
and
honourable
in
him
is
*NL*
to
refuse
it
,
and
put
her
virtuously
under
lock
and
key
,
and
murder
*NL*
her
lover
perhaps
.
But
is
that
essentially
right
,
and
proper
,
and
*NL*
honourable
,
or
is
it
contemptibly
mean
and
selfish
?
I
do
n't
profess
*NL*
to
decide
.
I
simply
am
going
to
act
by
instinct
,
and
let

If
a
person
who
has
blindly
walked
into

*NL*
quagmire
cries
for
help

I
am
inclined
to
give
it

if
possible

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
--
you
see

there
's
the
question

*NL*

Oh

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

I
do

said
Gillingham
*NL*
gravely
.
``
I
am
quite
amazed

to
tell
the
truth

that
such
a
sedate
,
*NL*
plodding
fellow
as
you
should
have
entertained
such
a
craze
for
a
*NL*
moment
.
You
said
when
I
called
that
she
was
puzzling
and
peculiar
:
*NL*
I
think
you
are
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
ever
stood
before
a
woman
whom
you
know
to
be
intrinsically
*NL*
a
good
woman
,
while
she
has
pleaded
for
release
--
been
the
man
she
has
*NL*
knelt
to
and
implored
indulgence
of
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
thankful
to
say
I
have
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
do
n't
think
you
are
in
a
position
to
give
an
opinion
.
I
*NL*
have
been
that
man
,
and
it
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world
,
if
*NL*
one
has
any
manliness
or
chivalry
in
him
.
I
had
not
the
remotest
*NL*
idea
--
living
apart
from
women
as
I
have
done
for
so
many
years
--
that
*NL*
merely
taking
a
woman
to
church
and
putting
a
ring
upon
her
finger
*NL*
could
by
any
possibility
involve
one
in
such
a
daily
,
continuous
*NL*
tragedy
as
that
now
shared
by
her
and
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
could
admit
some
excuse
for
letting
her
leave
you
,
provided
*NL*
she
kept
to
herself
.
But
to
go
attended
by
a
cavalier
--
that
makes
a
*NL*
difference
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
bit
.
Suppose
,
as
I
believe
,
she
would
rather
endure
her
*NL*
present
misery
than
be
made
to
promise
to
keep
apart
from
him
?
*NL*
All
that
is
a
question
for
herself
.
It
is
not
the
same
thing
at
*NL*
all
as
the
treachery
of
living
on
with
a
husband
and
playing
him
*NL*
false
...
However
,
she
has
not
distinctly
implied
living
with
him
*NL*
as
wife
,
though
I
think
she
means
to
...
And
,
to
the
best
of
my
*NL*
understanding
,
it
is
not
an
ignoble
,
merely
animal
,
feeling
between
*NL*
the
two
:
that
is
the
worst
of
it
;
because
it
makes
me
think
their
*NL*
affection
will
be
enduring
.
I
did
not
mean
to
confess
to
you
that
in
*NL*
the
first
jealous
weeks
of
my
marriage
,
before
I
had
come
to
my
right
*NL*
mind
,
I
hid
myself
in
the
school
one
evening
when
they
were
together
*NL*
there
,
and
I
heard
what
they
said
.
I
am
ashamed
of
it
now
,
though
*NL*
I
suppose
I
was
only
exercising
a
legal
right
.
I
found
from
their
*NL*
manner
that
an
extraordinary
affinity
,
or
sympathy
,
entered
into
*NL*
their
attachment
,
which
somehow
took
away
all
flavour
of
grossness
.
*NL*
Their
supreme
desire
is
to
be
together
--
to
share
each
other
's
*NL*
emotions
,
and
fancies
,
and
dreams
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Platonic

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
no

be
nearer

remind
me
of

are
their

Laon

Cythna

Also
of
Paul

if

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

said
Phillotson
sadly
.

never

*NL*
*NL*
``
Now

said
Gillingham
,
``
let
us
take
it
quietly
,
and
have
something
*NL*
to
drink
over
it
.
''
He
went
under
the
stairs
,
and
produced
a
bottle
*NL*
of
cider-wine
,
of
which
they
drank
a
rummer
each
.
``
I
think
you
are
*NL*
rafted
,
and
not
yourself

''
he
continued
.
``
Do
go
back
and
make
up

your
mind

put
up
with

hear
on
all

sides
that

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
yes
!
That
's
the
bitterness
of
it
!
Well

I
wo
n't
stay

I
have
a
*NL*
long
walk
before

.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gillingham
accompanied
his
friend
a
mile
on
his
way
,
and
at
parting
*NL*
expressed
his
hope
that
this
consultation
,
singular
as
its
subject
*NL*
was
,
would
be
the
renewal
of
their
old
comradeship
.
``
Stick
to
her
!
''
*NL*
were
his
last
words
,
flung
into
the
darkness
after
Phillotson
;
from
*NL*
which
his
friend
answered
``
Aye
,
aye
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
Phillotson
was
alone
under
the
clouds
of
night
,
and
no
*NL*
sound
was
audible
but
that
of
the
purling
tributaries
of
the
Stour
,
*NL*
he
said
,
``
So
Gillingham
,
my
friend
,
you
had
no
stronger
arguments
*NL*
against
it
than
those
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
she
ought
to
be
smacked
,
and
brought
to
her
senses
--
that
's
*NL*
what
I
think
!
''
murmured
Gillingham
,
as
he
walked
back
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
came
,
and
at
breakfast
Phillotson
told
Sue
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
go
--
with
whom
you
will
.
I
absolutely
and
unconditionally
*NL*
agree
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Having
once
come
to
this
conclusion
it
seemed
to
Phillotson
more
*NL*
and
more
indubitably
the
true
one
.
His
mild
serenity
at
the
sense
*NL*
that
he
was
doing
his
duty
by
a
woman
who
was
at
his
mercy
almost
*NL*
overpowered
his
grief
at
relinquishing
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
days
passed
,
and
the
evening
of
their
last
meal
together
had
*NL*
come
--
a
cloudy
evening
with
wind
--
which
indeed
was
very
seldom
absent
*NL*
in
this
elevated
place
.
How
permanently
it
was
imprinted
upon
his
*NL*
vision
;
that
look
of
her
as
she
glided
into
the
parlour
to
tea
;
*NL*
a
slim
flexible
figure
;
a
face
,
strained
from
its
roundness
,
and
*NL*
marked
by
the
pallors
of
restless
days
and
nights
,
suggesting
tragic
*NL*
possibilities
quite
at
variance
with
her
times
of
buoyancy
;
a
trying
*NL*
of
this
morsel
and
that
,
and
an
inability
to
eat
either
.
Her
nervous
*NL*
manner
,
begotten
of
a
fear
lest
he
should
be
injured
by
her
course
,
*NL*
might
have
been
interpreted
by
a
stranger
as
displeasure
that
*NL*
Phillotson
intruded
his
presence
on
her
for
the
few
brief
minutes
*NL*
that
remained
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
better
have
a
slice
of
ham
or
an
egg
,
or
something
with
your
*NL*
tea
?
You
ca
n't
travel
on
a
mouthful
of
bread
and
butter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
the
slice
he
helped
her
to
;
and
they
discussed
as
they
sat
*NL*
trivial
questions
of
housekeeping
,
such
as
where
he
would
find
the
*NL*
key
of
this
or
that
cupboard
,
what
little
bills
were
paid
,
and
what
*NL*
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
a
bachelor
by
nature
,
as
you
know
,
Sue
,
''
he
said
,
in
a
heroic
*NL*
attempt
to
put
her
at
her
ease
.
``
So
that
being
without
a
wife
will
*NL*
not
really
be
irksome
to
me
,
as
it
might
be
to
other
men
who
have
*NL*
had
one
a
little
while
.
I
have
,
too
,
this
grand
hobby
in
my
head
of
*NL*
writing
`
The
Roman
Antiquities
of
Wessex
,
'
which
will
occupy
all
my
*NL*
spare
hours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
will
send
me
some
of
the
manuscript
to
copy
at
any
time
,
*NL*
as
you
used
to
,
I
will
do
it
with
so
much
pleasure
!
''
she
said
with
*NL*
amenable
gentleness
.
``
I
should
much
like
to
be
some
help
to
you
*NL*
still
--
as
a
--
f-f-friend

*NL*
*NL*
Phillotson
mused
,
and
said
:
``
No
,
I
think
we
ought
to
be
really
*NL*
separate
,
if
we
are
to
be
at
all

And
for
this
reason
,
that
I
do
n't
*NL*
wish
to
ask
you
any
questions
,
and
particularly
wish
you
not
to
give
*NL*
me
information
as
to
your
movements

even
your
address

must
have
some

you
know

any
of

away
from
you

I
do
n't
want
any
either

have
enough

my

long
while

*NL*
*NL*
Sue
was
for
a
few
moments
a
little
tearful
at
these
reflections
,
and
*NL*
then
the
station
omnibus
came
round
to
take
her
up
.
Phillotson
saw
*NL*
her
things
put
on
the
top
,
handed
her
in
,
and
was
obliged
to
make
an
*NL*
appearance
of
kissing
her
as
he
wished
her
good-bye
,
which
she
quite
*NL*
understood
and
imitated
.
From
the
cheerful
manner
in
which
they
*NL*
parted
the
omnibus-man
had
no
other
idea
than
that
she
was
going
for
*NL*
a
short
visit
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Phillotson
got
back
into
the
house
he
went
upstairs
and
opened
*NL*
the
window
in
the
direction
the
omnibus
had
taken
.
Soon
the
noise
of
*NL*
its
wheels
died
away
.
He
came
down
then
,
his
face
compressed
like
*NL*
that
of
one
bearing
pain
;
he
put
on
his
hat
and
went
out
,
following
*NL*
by
the
same
route
for
nearly
a
mile
.
Suddenly
turning
round
he
came
*NL*
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
no
sooner
entered
than
the
voice
of
his
friend
Gillingham
*NL*
greeted
him
from
the
front
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
make
nobody
hear

so
finding
your
door
open
I
walked
in

said

Phillotson

throat
got
choked
up

turned

pushed
the
tea-things
aside

There
was
a
stability
,
a
ballast
,
in
Phillotson
's
pronouncement
which
*NL*
restrained
his
friend
's
comment
.
``
Shall
I
--
leave
you
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no

It
is
a
mercy
to
me
that
you
have
come

I
have
some
*NL*
articles
to
arrange
and
clear
away

Would
you
help
me
?

Gillingham
assented
;
and
having
gone
to
the
upper
rooms
the
*NL*
schoolmaster
opened
drawers
,
and
began
taking
out
all
Sue
's
things
*NL*
that
she
had
left
behind
,
and
laying
them
in
a
large
box
.
``
She
*NL*
would
n't
take
all
I
wanted
her
to
,
''
he
continued
.
``
But
when
I
made
*NL*
up
my
mind
to
her
going
to
live
in
her
own
way
I
did
make
up
my
*NL*
mind

``
Some

would
have
stopped
at
an
agreement

I
've
gone
into
all
that

was
,

am
,
the
most
old-fashioned
man
in
the
world
on
the
question
of
*NL*
marriage
--
in
fact
I
had
never
thought
critically
about
its
ethics

at
all

But
certain
facts
stared
me
in
the
face
,

I
could
n't
go

against
them

*NL*
*NL*
They
went
on
with
the
packing
silently
.
When
it
was
done
Phillotson
*NL*
closed
the
box
and
turned
the
key
.

*NL*
``
There

said

Four-and-twenty
hours
before
this
time
Sue
had
written
the
following
*NL*
note
to
Jude
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
as
I
told
you
;
and
I
am
leaving
to-morrow
evening
.
*NL*
Richard
and
I
thought
it
could
be
done
with
less
*NL*
obtrusiveness
after
dark
.
I
feel
rather
frightened
,
and
*NL*
therefore
ask
you
to
be
sure
you
are
on
the
Melchester
*NL*
platform
to
meet
me
.
I
arrive
at
a
little
to
seven
.
I
*NL*
know
you
will
,
of
course
,
dear
Jude
;
but
I
feel
so
timid
*NL*
that
I
ca
n't
help
begging
you
to
be
punctual
.
He
has
*NL*
been
so
VERY
kind
to
me
through
it
all
!
*NL*
*NL*
Now
to
our
meeting
!
*NL*
*NL*
S

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
was
carried
by
the
omnibus
farther
and
farther
down
from
*NL*
the
mountain
town
--
the
single
passenger
that
evening
--
she
regarded
*NL*
the
receding
road
with
a
sad
face
.
But
no
hesitation
was
apparent
*NL*
therein
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
up-train
by
which
she
was
departing
stopped
by
signal
only
.
To
*NL*
Sue
it
seemed
strange
that
such
a
powerful
organization
as
a
railway
*NL*
train
should
be
brought
to
a
stand-still
on
purpose
for
her
--
a
*NL*
fugitive
from
her
lawful
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
twenty
minutes
'
journey
drew
towards
its
close
,
and
Sue
began
*NL*
gathering
her
things
together
to
alight
.
At
the
moment
that
the
*NL*
train
came
to
a
stand-still
by
the
Melchester
platform
a
hand
was
*NL*
laid
on
the
door
and
she
beheld
Jude
.
He
entered
the
compartment
*NL*
promptly
.
He
had
a
black
bag
in
his
hand
,
and
was
dressed
in
*NL*
the
dark
suit
he
wore
on
Sundays
and
in
the
evening
after
work
.
*NL*
Altogether
he
looked
a
very
handsome
young
fellow
,
his
ardent
*NL*
affection
for
her
burning
in
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
Jude
!
''
She
clasped
his
hand
with
both
hers
,
and
her
tense
state
*NL*
caused
her
to
simmer
over
in
a
little
succession
of
dry
sobs
.
``
I
--
I
*NL*
am
so
glad
!
I
get
out
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
I
get
in
,
dear
one
!
I
've
packed
.
Besides
this
bag
I
've
only
a
*NL*
big
box
which
is
labelled
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
do
n't
I
get
out
?
Are
n't
we
going
to
stay
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
could
n't
possibly
,
do
n't
you
see
.
We
are
known
here
--
I
,
at
any
*NL*
rate
,
am
well
known
.
I
've
booked
for
Aldbrickham
;
and
here
's
your
*NL*
ticket
for
the
same
place
,
as
you
have
only
one
to
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
we
should
have
stayed
here
,
''
she
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
n't
have
done
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
Perhaps
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
n't
time
for
me
to
write
and
say
the
place
I
had
decided
*NL*
on
.
Aldbrickham
is
a
much
bigger
town
--
sixty
or
seventy
thousand
*NL*
inhabitants
--
and
nobody
knows
anything
about
us
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
have
given
up
your
cathedral
work
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
It
was
rather
sudden
--
your
message
coming
unexpectedly
.
*NL*
Strictly
,
I
might
have
been
made
to
finish
out
the
week
.
But
I
*NL*
pleaded
urgency
and
I
was
let
off
.
I
would
have
deserted
any
day
at
*NL*
your
command
,
dear
Sue
.
I
have
deserted
more
than
that
for
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
fear
I
am
doing
you
a
lot
of
harm
.
Ruining
your
prospects
of
the
*NL*
Church
;
ruining
your
progress
in
your
trade
;
everything
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Church
is
no
more
to
me

Let
it
lie
!

I
_
am
not
to
be
one
of
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
soldier-saints
who
,
row
on
row

*NL*
Burn
upward
each
to
his
point
of
bliss

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
if
any
such
there
be

My
point
of
bliss
is
not
upward
,
but
here

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
I
seem
so
bad
--
upsetting
men
's
courses
like
this
!
''
said
she
,
*NL*
taking
up
in
her
voice
the
emotion
that
had
begun
in
his
.
But
she
*NL*
recovered
her
equanimity
by
the
time
they
had
travelled
a
dozen
*NL*
miles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
been
so
good
in
letting
me
go
,
''
she
resumed
.
``
And
here
's
a
*NL*
note
I
found
on
my
dressing-table
,
addressed
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
He
's
not
an
unworthy
fellow

''
said
Jude
,
glancing
at
the
note
.
*NL*
``
And
I
am
ashamed
of
myself
for
hating
him
because
he
married
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
According
to
the
rule
of
women
's
whims
I
suppose
I
ought
to
suddenly
*NL*
love
him
,
because
he
has
let
me
go
so
generously
and
unexpectedly
,
''
*NL*
she
answered
smiling
.
``
But
I
am
so
cold
,
or
devoid
of
gratitude
,
or
*NL*
so
something
,
that
even
this
generosity
has
n't
made
me
love
him
,
or
*NL*
repent
,
or
want
to
stay
with
him
as
his
wife
;
although
I
do
feel
I
*NL*
like
his
large-mindedness
,
and
respect
him
more
than
ever
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
may
not
work
so
well
for
us
as
if
he
had
been
less
kind
,
and
you
*NL*
had
run
away
against
his
will
,

murmured
Jude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
NEVER
would
have
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
's
eyes
rested
musingly
on
her
face
.
Then
he
suddenly
kissed
*NL*
her
;
and
was
going
to
kiss
her
again
.
``
No
--
only
once
now
--
please
,
*NL*
Jude
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
rather
cruel
,
''
he
answered
;
but
acquiesced
.
``
Such
a
strange
*NL*
thing
has
happened
to
me
,
''
Jude
continued
after
a
silence
.
``
Arabella
*NL*
has
actually
written
to
ask
me
to
get
a
divorce
from
her
--
in
kindness
*NL*
to
her
,
she
says
.
She
wants
to
honestly
and
legally
marry
that
man
*NL*
she
has
already
married
virtually
;
and
begs
me
to
enable
her
to
do
*NL*
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
you
done
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
agreed

I
thought
at
first
I
could
n't
do
it
without
getting
*NL*
her
into
trouble
about
that
second
marriage
,
and
I
do
n't
want
to
*NL*
injure
her
in
any
way
.
Perhaps
she
's
no
worse
than
I
am
,
after
all
!
*NL*
But
nobody
knows
about
it
over
here
,
and
I
find
it
will
not
be
a
*NL*
difficult
proceeding
at
all
.
If
she
wants
to
start
afresh
I
have
*NL*
only
too
obvious
reasons
for
not
hindering
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
'll
be
free
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
shall
be
free

*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
we
booked
for
?

she
asked
,
with
the
discontinuity
that
*NL*
marked
her
to-night
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aldbrickham
,
as
I
said
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
will
be
very
late
when
we
get
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
I
thought
of
that
,
and
I
wired
for
a
room
for
us
at
the
*NL*
Temperance
Hotel
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
one

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
.
``
Oh
Jude
!
''
Sue
bent
her
forehead
against
the
*NL*
corner
of
the
compartment
.
``
I
thought
you
might
do
it
;
and
that
I
*NL*
was
deceiving
you
.
But
I
did
n't
mean
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
pause
which
followed
,
Jude
's
eyes
fixed
themselves
with
*NL*
a
stultified
expression
on
the
opposite
seat
.
``
Well
!
''
he
*NL*
said
...
``
Well
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
remained
in
silence
;
and
seeing
how
discomfited
he
was
she
put
her
*NL*
face
against
his
cheek
,
murmuring
,
``
Do
n't
be
vexed
,
dear
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
there
's
no
harm
done
,
''
he
said
.
``
But
--
I
understood
it
like
*NL*
that
...
Is
this
a
sudden
change
of
mind
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
no
right
to
ask
me
such
a
question
;
and
I
sha
n't
answer
!

*NL*
she
said
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
one
,
your
happiness
is
more
to
me
than
anything
--
although
we
*NL*
seem
to
verge
on
quarrelling
so
often
!
--
and
your
will
is
law
to
me
.
*NL*
I
am
something
more
than
a
mere
--
selfish
fellow
,
I
hope

Have
it
as
*NL*
you
wish
!

On
reflection
his
brow
showed
perplexity
.
``
But
perhaps
*NL*
it
is
that
you
do
n't
love
me
--
not
that
you
have
become
conventional

*NL*
Much
as
,
under
your
teaching
,
I
hate
convention
,
I
hope
it
IS
that
,
*NL*
not
the
other
terrible
alternative
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Even
at
this
obvious
moment
for
candour
Sue
could
not
be
quite
candid
*NL*
as
to
the
state
of
that
mystery
,
her
heart
.
``
Put
it
down
to
my
*NL*
timidity
,
''
she
said
with
hurried
evasiveness
;
``
to
a
woman
's
natural
*NL*
timidity
when
the
crisis
comes
.
I
may
feel
as
well
as
you
that
I
*NL*
have
a
perfect
right
to
live
with
you
as
you
thought
--
from
this
*NL*
moment
.
I
may
hold
the
opinion
that
,
in
a
proper
state
of
society
,
*NL*
the
father
of
a
woman
's
child
will
be
as
much
a
private
matter
of
*NL*
hers
as
the
cut
of
her
underlinen
,
on
whom
nobody
will
have
any
*NL*
right
to
question
her
.
But
partly
,
perhaps
,
because
it
is
by
his
*NL*
generosity
that
I
am
now
free
,
I
would
rather
not
be
other
than
a
*NL*
little
rigid
.
If
there
had
been
a
rope-ladder
,
and
he
had
run
after
*NL*
us
with
pistols
,
it
would
have
seemed
different
,
and
I
may
have
acted
*NL*
otherwise
.
But
do
n't
press
me
and
criticize
me
,
Jude
!
Assume
that
*NL*
I
have
n't
the
courage
of
my
opinions
.
I
know
I
am
a
poor
miserable
*NL*
creature

My
nature
is
not
so
passionate
as
yours
!

*NL*
*NL*
He
repeated
simply
!
``
I
thought

what
I
naturally
thought

But
if
we
*NL*
are
not
lovers

we
are
not

Phillotson
thought
so
,
I
am
sure

See

*NL*
here
is
what
he
has
written
to
me

He
opened
the
letter
she
had
*NL*
brought
,
and
read
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
make
only
one
condition

that

I

even
love
may
be
cruel
at
times

made
for
each
other
:
it
is
obvious
,
palpable
,
to
any
unbiased
older

person

You
were
all
along
`
the
shadowy
third

in
my
short
life

her

repeat

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's

n't

she
said
with
latent
tears
.
On
*NL*
reconsideration
she
added
,
``
He
was
very
resigned
to
letting
me

go

too
resigned
almost

never
was
so
near

in
love
with
him

as
when
he
made
such
thoughtful
arrangements
for
my
being
comfortable

on
my
journey
,
and
offering
to
provide
money

Yet
I
was
not

If
I

loved
him
ever
so
little
as
a

go
back

pettishly

*NL*
*NL*
``

she
said
,
and
drawing
away
from
*NL*
him
as
far
as
she
could
,
looked
severely
out
into
the
darkness
.
She
*NL*
added
in
hurt
tones
,
without
turning
round
:
``
My
liking
for
you
is
*NL*
not
as
some
women
's
perhaps
.
But
it
is
a
delight
in
being
with
you
,
*NL*
of
a
supremely
delicate
kind
,
and
I
do
n't
want
to
go
further
and
risk
*NL*
it
by
--
an
attempt
to
intensify
it
!
I
quite
realized
that
,
as
woman
*NL*
with
man
,
it
was
a
risk
to
come
.
But
,
as
me
with
you
,
I
resolved
to
*NL*
trust
you
to
set
my
wishes
above
your
gratification
.
Do
n't
discuss
*NL*
it
further
,
dear
Jude
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
if
it
would
make
you
reproach
yourself
...
but
you
do
*NL*
like
me
very
much
,
Sue
?
Say
you
do
!
Say
that
you
do
a
quarter
,
a
*NL*
tenth
,
as
much
as
I
do
you
,
and
I
'll
be
content
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
let
you
kiss
me
,
and
that
tells
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
once
or
so
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
do
n't
be
a
greedy
boy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
leant
back
,
and
did
not
look
at
her
for
a
long
time
.
That
*NL*
episode
in
her
past
history
of
which
she
had
told
him
--
of
the
poor
*NL*
Christminster
graduate
whom
she
had
handled
thus
,
returned
to
Jude
's
*NL*
mind
;
and
he
saw
himself
as
a
possible
second
in
such
a
torturing
*NL*
destiny
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
a
queer
elopement
!
''
he
murmured
.
``
Perhaps
you
are
making
*NL*
a
cat
's
paw
of
me
with
Phillotson
all
this
time
.
Upon
my
word
it
*NL*
almost
seems
so
--
to
see
you
sitting
up
there
so
prim
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
you
must
n't
be
angry
--
I
wo
n't
let
you
!
''
she
coaxed
,
turning
and
*NL*
moving
nearer
to
him
.
``
You
did
kiss
me
just
now
,
you
know
;
and
I
*NL*
did
n't
dislike
you
to
,
I
own
it
,
Jude
.
Only
I
do
n't
want
to
let
you
*NL*
do
it
again
,
just
yet
--
considering
how
we
are
circumstanced
,
do
n't
*NL*
you
see
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
never
resist
her
when
she
pleaded
-LRB-
as
she
well
knew
-RRB-
.
And
*NL*
they
sat
side
by
side
with
joined
hands
,
till
she
aroused
herself
at
*NL*
some
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
possibly
go
to
that
Temperance
Inn
,
after
your
telegraphing
*NL*
that
message
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
see
well
enough
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
;
there
'll
be
some
other
one
open
,
no
doubt
.
I
have
*NL*
sometimes
thought
,
since
your
marrying
Phillotson
because
of
a
stupid
*NL*
scandal
,
that
under
the
affectation
of
independent
views
you
are
as
*NL*
enslaved
to
the
social
code
as
any
woman
I
know
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
mentally
.
But
I
have
n't
the
courage
of
my
views
,
as
I
said
*NL*
before
.
I
did
n't
marry
him
altogether
because
of
the
scandal
.
*NL*
But
sometimes
a
woman
's
LOVE
OF
BEING
LOVED
gets
the
better
of
her
*NL*
conscience
,
and
though
she
is
agonized
at
the
thought
of
treating
a
*NL*
man
cruelly
,
she
encourages
him
to
love
her
while
she
does
n't
love
*NL*
him
at
all
.
Then
,
when
she
sees
him
suffering
,
her
remorse
sets
in
,
*NL*
and
she
does
what
she
can
to
repair
the
wrong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
simply
mean
that
you
flirted
outrageously
with
him
,
poor
old
*NL*
chap
,
and
then
repented
,
and
to
make
reparation
,
married
him
,
though
*NL*
you
tortured
yourself
to
death
by
doing
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
if
you
will
put
it
brutally
!
--
it
was
a
little
like
that
--
that
*NL*
and
the
scandal
together
--
and
your
concealing
from
me
what
you
ought
*NL*
to
have
told
me
before
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
see
that
she
was
distressed
and
tearful
at
his
criticisms
,
*NL*
and
soothed
her
,
saying
:
``
There
,
dear
;
do
n't
mind
!
Crucify
me
,
if
*NL*
you
will
!
You
know
you
are
all
the
world
to
me
,
whatever
you
do
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
bad
and
unprincipled
--
I
know
you
think
that
!
''
she
said
,
*NL*
trying
to
blink
away
her
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
and
know
you
are
my
dear
Sue
,
from
whom
neither
length
nor
*NL*
breadth
,
nor
things
present
nor
things
to
come
,
can
divide
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Though
so
sophisticated
in
many
things
,
she
was
such
a
child
in
others
*NL*
that
this
satisfied
her
,
and
they
reached
the
end
of
their
journey
*NL*
on
the
best
of
terms
.
It
was
about
ten
o'clock
when
they
arrived
at
*NL*
Aldbrickham
,
the
county
town
of
North
Wessex
.
As
she
would
not
go
*NL*
to
the
Temperance
Hotel
because
of
the
form
of
his
telegram
,
Jude
*NL*
inquired
for
another
;
and
a
youth
who
volunteered
to
find
one
wheeled
*NL*
their
luggage
to
the
George
farther
on
,
which
proved
to
be
the
inn
at
*NL*
which
Jude
had
stayed
with
Arabella
on
that
one
occasion
of
their
*NL*
meeting
after
their
division
for
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
Owing
,
however
,
to
their
now
entering
it
by
another
door
,
and
to
his
*NL*
preoccupation
,
he
did
not
at
first
recognize
the
place
.
When
they
*NL*
had
engaged
their
respective
rooms
they
went
down
to
a
late
supper
.
*NL*
During
Jude
's
temporary
absence
the
waiting-maid
spoke
to
Sue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
,
ma'am
,
I
remember
your
relation
,
or
friend
,
or
whatever
he
*NL*
is
,
coming
here
once
before
--
late
,
just
like
this
,
with
his
wife
--
a
*NL*
lady
,
at
any
rate
,
that
was
n't
you
by
no
manner
of
means
--
jest
as
med
*NL*
be
with
you
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
do
you
?
''
said
Sue
,
with
a
certain
sickness
of
heart
.
``
Though
I
*NL*
think
you
must
be
mistaken
!
How
long
ago
was
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
a
month
or
two
.
A
handsome
,
full-figured
woman
.
They
had
*NL*
this
room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Jude
came
back
and
sat
down
to
supper
Sue
seemed
moping
and
*NL*
miserable
.
``
Jude
,
''
she
said
to
him
plaintively
,
at
their
parting
*NL*
that
night
upon
the
landing
,
``
it
is
not
so
nice
and
pleasant
as
it
*NL*
used
to
be
with
us

I
do

it
here

I
ca
n't

place

And
I
do

you
so
well
as
I
did
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
fidgeted
you
seem
,
dear

Why
do
you
change
like
this

*NL*
*NL*

was
cruel

bring
me
here

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
lately
here
with
Arabella

There

*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
me

said
Jude
looking
round
him
.
``
Yes

it
is
the
same

*NL*
I
really
did
n't
know
it

is
not
cruel

since
we

come
as
we
have

two
relations
staying
together

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
long
ago

it

were
here

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
day
before

met
you
in
Christminster

together

*NL*
*NL*

Yes

you
did

was
that
you
had
met
as
estranged
people

who
were
not
husband
*NL*
and
wife
at
all
in
Heaven
's
sight

it
up

her

*NL*
*NL*
``
We
did

he
said
sadly
.

false

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
by

are
only
to

is
so
very
inconsistent
of
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Friends
can
be
jealous

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do

concede
nothing

in

She
was
so
mortified
that
he
was
*NL*
obliged
to
take
her
into
her
room
and
close
the
door
lest
the
people

should
hear

*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
Slipping
down
on
her
knees
Sue
buried
her
face
in
the
bed
and
wept
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
knew
such
an
unreasonable

such
a
dog-in-the-manger

*NL*
``
Oh

It
was
true
that
he
did
not
understand
her
feelings
very
well
.
But
*NL*
he
did
a
little
;
and
began
to
love
her
none
the
less
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
--
I
thought
you
cared
for
nobody

desired

me

as
distressed
as

Looking
up
from
the
quilt
she
pouted
provokingly
:
``
If

perhaps
I

have
gone
on
to
the

all

you
proposed

I

you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

said

distantly

your

left

own
accord
years

years
ago

sense

it

was
,
that
a
parting
such
as
yours

mine

ended

the
marriage

Yet
I
must
tell

one
thing

settle

another
man

really

hold

would
fearfully
concede

But
I
shall
never
inform
against

And
it
is
evidently
a
prick
of
conscience
in
her
that
has
led
*NL*
her
to
urge
me
to
get
a
divorce
,
that
she
may
remarry
this
man
*NL*
legally

So
you
perceive
I

not

again

*NL*
``

you
did

more
gently

rose

know
hardly
any
poetry
,
''
he
replied
mournfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
?
These
are
some
of
them
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
Being
whom
my
spirit
oft
*NL*
Met
on
its
visioned
wanderings
far
aloft
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
A
seraph
of
Heaven
,
too
gentle
to
be
human
,
*NL*
Veiling
beneath
that
radiant
form
of
woman
...
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
it
is
too
flattering
,
so
I
wo
n't
go
on
!
But
say
it
's
me
!
Say
*NL*
it
's
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
you
,
dear
;
exactly
like
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
I
forgive
you
!
And
you
shall
kiss
me
just
once
there
--
not
very
*NL*
long

''
She
put
the
tip
of
her
finger
gingerly
to
her
cheek
;
and
he
*NL*
did
as
commanded
.
``
You
do
care
for
me
very
much
,
do
n't
you
,
in
spite
*NL*
of
my
not
--

know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

he
said
with
a
sigh

bade
her
good-night

VI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
returning
to
his
native
town
of
Shaston
as
schoolmaster
Phillotson
*NL*
had
won
the
interest
and
awakened
the
memories
of
the
inhabitants
,
*NL*
who
,
though
they
did
not
honour
him
for
his
miscellaneous
acquirements
*NL*
as
he
would
have
been
honoured
elsewhere
,
retained
for
him
a
sincere
*NL*
regard
.
When
,
shortly
after
his
arrival
,
he
brought
home
a
pretty
*NL*
wife
--
awkwardly
pretty
for
him
,
if
he
did
not
take
care
,
they
*NL*
said
--
they
were
glad
to
have
her
settle
among
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
some
time
after
her
flight
from
that
home
Sue
's
absence
did
not
*NL*
excite
comment
.
Her
place
as
monitor
in
the
school
was
taken
by
*NL*
another
young
woman
within
a
few
days
of
her
vacating
it
,
which
*NL*
substitution
also
passed
without
remark
,
Sue
's
services
having
been
*NL*
of
a
provisional
nature
only
.
When
,
however
,
a
month
had
passed
,
and
*NL*
Phillotson
casually
admitted
to
an
acquaintance
that
he
did
not
know
*NL*
where
his
wife
was
staying
,
curiosity
began
to
be
aroused
;
till
,
*NL*
jumping
to
conclusions
,
people
ventured
to
affirm
that
Sue
had
played
*NL*
him
false
and
run
away
from
him
.
The
schoolmaster
's
growing
languor
*NL*
and
listlessness
over
his
work
gave
countenance
to
the
idea
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
Phillotson
had
held
his
tongue
as
long
as
he
could
,
except
to
*NL*
his
friend
Gillingham
,
his
honesty
and
directness
would
not
allow
him
*NL*
to
do
so
when
misapprehensions
as
to
Sue
's
conduct
spread
abroad
.
*NL*
On
a
Monday
morning
the
chairman
of
the
school
committee
called
,
and
*NL*
after
attending
to
the
business
of
the
school
drew
Phillotson
aside
*NL*
out
of
earshot
of
the
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
excuse
my
asking
,
Phillotson
,
since
everybody
is
talking
of
*NL*
it
:
is
this
true
as
to
your
domestic
affairs
--
that
your
wife
's
going
*NL*
away
was
on
no
visit
,
but
a
secret
elopement
with
a
lover
?
If
so
,
I
*NL*
condole
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
,
''
said
Phillotson
.
``
There
was
no
secret
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
gone
to
visit
friends
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
what
has
happened
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
gone
away
under
circumstances
that
usually
call
for
*NL*
condolence
with
the
husband
.
But
I
gave
my
consent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
chairman
looked
as
if
he
had
not
apprehended
the
remark
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
I
say
is
quite
true
,
''
Phillotson
continued
testily
.
``
She
asked
*NL*
leave
to
go
away
with
her
lover
,
and
I
let
her
.
Why
should
n't
I
?
A
*NL*
woman
of
full
age
,
it
was
a
question
of
her
own
conscience
--
not
for
*NL*
me
.
I
was
not
her
gaoler
.
I
ca
n't
explain
any
further
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
wish
to
be
questioned
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
children
observed
that
much
seriousness
marked
the
faces
of
*NL*
the
two
men
,
and
went
home
and
told
their
parents
that
something
*NL*
new
had
happened
about
Mrs.
Phillotson
.
Then
Phillotson
's
little
*NL*
maidservant
,
who
was
a
schoolgirl
just
out
of
her
standards
,
said
*NL*
that
Mr.
Phillotson
had
helped
in
his
wife
's
packing
,
had
offered
*NL*
her
what
money
she
required
,
and
had
written
a
friendly
letter
to
*NL*
her
young
man
,
telling
him
to
take
care
of
her
.
The
chairman
of
*NL*
committee
thought
the
matter
over
,
and
talked
to
the
other
managers
*NL*
of
the
school
,
till
a
request
came
to
Phillotson
to
meet
them
*NL*
privately
.
The
meeting
lasted
a
long
time
,
and
at
the
end
the
*NL*
school-master
came
home
,
looking
as
usual
pale
and
worn
.
Gillingham
*NL*
was
sitting
in
his
house
awaiting
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
;
it
is
as
you
said
,
''
observed
Phillotson
,
flinging
himself
*NL*
down
wearily
in
a
chair
.
``
They
have
requested
me
to
send
in
my
*NL*
resignation
on
account
of
my
scandalous
conduct
in
giving
my
tortured
*NL*
wife
her
liberty
--
or
,
as
they
call
it
,
condoning
her
adultery
.
But
I
*NL*
sha
n't
resign
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
would
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
.
It
is
no
business
of
theirs
.
It
does
n't
affect
me
in
my
*NL*
public
capacity
at
all
.
They
may
expel
me
if
they
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
make
a
fuss
it
will
get
into
the
papers
,
and
you
'll
never
get
*NL*
appointed
to
another
school
.
You
see
,
they
have
to
consider
what
*NL*
you
did
as
done
by
a
teacher
of
youth
--
and
its
effects
as
such
upon
*NL*
the
morals
of
the
town
;
and
,
to
ordinary
opinion
,
your
position
is
*NL*
indefensible
.
You
must
let
me
say
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
good
advice
,
however
,
Phillotson
would
not
listen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
care
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
do
n't
go
unless
I
am
turned
out
.
And
*NL*
for
this
reason
;
that
by
resigning
I
acknowledge
I
have
acted
wrongly
*NL*
by
her
;
when
I
am
more
and
more
convinced
every
day
that
in
the
sight
*NL*
of
Heaven
and
by
all
natural
,
straightforward
humanity
,
I
have
acted
*NL*
rightly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gillingham
saw
that
his
rather
headstrong
friend
would
not
be
able
to
*NL*
maintain
such
a
position
as
this
;
but
he
said
nothing
further
,
and
*NL*
in
due
time
--
indeed
,
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
--
the
formal
letter
of
*NL*
dismissal
arrived
,
the
managers
having
remained
behind
to
write
it
*NL*
after
Phillotson
's
withdrawal
.
The
latter
replied
that
he
should
not
*NL*
accept
dismissal
;
and
called
a
public
meeting
,
which
he
attended
,
*NL*
although
he
looked
so
weak
and
ill
that
his
friend
implored
him
to
*NL*
stay
at
home
.
When
he
stood
up
to
give
his
reasons
for
contesting
*NL*
the
decision
of
the
managers
he
advanced
them
firmly
,
as
he
had
*NL*
done
to
his
friend
,
and
contended
,
moreover
,
that
the
matter
was
a
*NL*
domestic
theory
which
did
not
concern
them
.
This
they
over-ruled
,
*NL*
insisting
that
the
private
eccentricities
of
a
teacher
came
quite
*NL*
within
their
sphere
of
control
,
as
it
touched
the
morals
of
those
he
*NL*
taught
.
Phillotson
replied
that
he
did
not
see
how
an
act
of
natural
*NL*
charity
could
injure
morals
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
respectable
inhabitants
and
well-to-do
fellow-natives
of
*NL*
the
town
were
against
Phillotson
to
a
man
.
But
,
somewhat
to
his
*NL*
surprise
,
some
dozen
or
more
champions
rose
up
in
his
defence
as
from
*NL*
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
has
been
stated
that
Shaston
was
the
anchorage
of
a
curious
and
*NL*
interesting
group
of
itinerants
,
who
frequented
the
numerous
fairs
*NL*
and
markets
held
up
and
down
Wessex
during
the
summer
and
autumn
*NL*
months
.
Although
Phillotson
had
never
spoken
to
one
of
these
*NL*
gentlemen
they
now
nobly
led
the
forlorn
hope
in
his
defence
.
*NL*
The
body
included
two
cheap
Jacks
,
a
shooting-gallery
proprietor
*NL*
and
the
ladies
who
loaded
the
guns
,
a
pair
of
boxing-masters
,
a
*NL*
steam-roundabout
manager
,
two
travelling
broom-makers
,
who
called
*NL*
themselves
widows
,
a
gingerbread-stall
keeper
,
a
swing-boat
owner
,
*NL*
and
a
``
test-your-strength
''
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
generous
phalanx
of
supporters
,
and
a
few
others
of
independent
*NL*
judgment
,
whose
own
domestic
experiences
had
been
not
without
*NL*
vicissitude
,
came
up
and
warmly
shook
hands
with
Phillotson
;
after
*NL*
which
they
expressed
their
thoughts
so
strongly
to
the
meeting
that
*NL*
issue
was
joined
,
the
result
being
a
general
scuffle
,
wherein
a
black
*NL*
board
was
split
,
three
panes
of
the
school
windows
were
broken
,
*NL*
an
inkbottle
was
spilled
over
a
town-councillor
's
shirt
front
,
*NL*
a
churchwarden
was
dealt
such
a
topper
with
the
map
of
Palestine
*NL*
that
his
head
went
right
through
Samaria
,
and
many
black
eyes
and
*NL*
bleeding
noses
were
given
,
one
of
which
,
to
everybody
's
horror
,
was
*NL*
the
venerable
incumbent
's
,
owing
to
the
zeal
of
an
emancipated
*NL*
chimney-sweep
,
who
took
the
side
of
Phillotson
's
party
.
When
*NL*
Phillotson
saw
the
blood
running
down
the
rector
's
face
he
deplored
*NL*
almost
in
groans
the
untoward
and
degrading
circumstances
,
regretted
*NL*
that
he
had
not
resigned
when
called
upon
,
and
went
home
so
ill
that
*NL*
next
morning
he
could
not
leave
his
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
farcical
yet
melancholy
event
was
the
beginning
of
a
serious
*NL*
illness
for
him
;
and
he
lay
in
his
lonely
bed
in
the
pathetic
state
*NL*
of
mind
of
a
middle-aged
man
who
perceives
at
length
that
his
*NL*
life
,
intellectual
and
domestic
,
is
tending
to
failure
and
gloom
.
*NL*
Gillingham
came
to
see
him
in
the
evenings
,
and
on
one
occasion
*NL*
mentioned
Sue
's
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
does
n't
care
anything
about
me
!
''
said
Phillotson
.
``
Why
should
*NL*
she
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
does
n't
know
you
are
ill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
much
the
better
for
both
of
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
her
lover
and
she
living
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
Melchester
--
I
suppose
;
at
least
he
was
living
there
some
time
*NL*
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Gillingham
reached
home
he
sat
and
reflected
,
and
at
last
wrote
*NL*
an
anonymous
line
to
Sue
,
on
the
bare
chance
of
its
reaching
her
,
*NL*
the
letter
being
enclosed
in
an
envelope
addressed
to
Jude
at
the
*NL*
diocesan
capital
.
Arriving
at
that
place
it
was
forwarded
to
*NL*
Marygreen
in
North
Wessex
,
and
thence
to
Aldbrickham
by
the
only
*NL*
person
who
knew
his
present
address
--
the
widow
who
had
nursed
his
*NL*
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Three
days
later
,
in
the
evening
,
when
the
sun
was
going
down
in
*NL*
splendour
over
the
lowlands
of
Blackmoor
,
and
making
the
Shaston
*NL*
windows
like
tongues
of
fire
to
the
eyes
of
the
rustics
in
that
vale
,
*NL*
the
sick
man
fancied
that
he
heard
somebody
come
to
the
house
,
and
a
*NL*
few
minutes
after
there
was
a
tap
at
the
bedroom
door
.
Phillotson
*NL*
did
not
speak
;
the
door
was
hesitatingly
opened
,
and
there
*NL*
entered
--
Sue
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
in
light
spring
clothing
,
and
her
advent
seemed
ghostly
--
like
*NL*
the
flitting
in
of
a
moth
.
He
turned
his
eyes
upon
her
,
and
flushed
;
*NL*
but
appeared
to
check
his
primary
impulse
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
business
here
,
''
she
said
,
bending
her
frightened
face
to
*NL*
him
.
``
But
I
heard
you
were
ill
--
very
ill
;
and
--
and
as
I
know
that
*NL*
you
recognize
other
feelings
between
man
and
woman
than
physical
*NL*
love
,
I
have
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
very
ill
,
my
dear
friend
.
Only
unwell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
know
that
;
and
I
am
afraid
that
only
a
severe
illness
would
*NL*
have
justified
my
coming
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
...
yes
.
And
I
almost
wish
you
had
not
come
!
It
is
a
little
*NL*
too
soon
--
that
's
all
I
mean
.
Still
,
let
us
make
the
best
of
it
.
You
*NL*
have
n't
heard
about
the
school
,
I
suppose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
what
about
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
that
I
am
going
away
from
here
to
another
place
.
The
managers
*NL*
and
I
do
n't
agree
,
and
we
are
going
to
part
--
that
's
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sue
did
not
for
a
moment
,
either
now
or
later
,
suspect
what
troubles
*NL*
had
resulted
to
him
from
letting
her
go
;
it
never
once
seemed
to
*NL*
cross
her
mind
,
and
she
had
received
no
news
whatever
from
Shaston
.
*NL*
They
talked
on
slight
and
ephemeral
subjects
,
and
when
his
tea
was
*NL*
brought
up
he
told
the
amazed
little
servant
that
a
cup
was
to
be
set
*NL*
for
Sue
.
That
young
person
was
much
more
interested
in
their
history
*NL*
than
they
supposed
,
and
as
she
descended
the
stairs
she
lifted
her
*NL*
eyes
and
hands
in
grotesque
amazement
.
While
they
sipped
Sue
went
*NL*
to
the
window
and
thoughtfully
said
,
``
It
is
such
a
beautiful
sunset
,
*NL*
Richard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
mostly
beautiful
from
here
,
owing
to
the
rays
crossing
the
*NL*
mist
of
the
vale
.
But
I
lose
them
all
,
as
they
do
n't
shine
into
this
*NL*
gloomy
corner
where
I
lie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
n't
you
like
to
see
this
particular
one
?
It
is
like
heaven
*NL*
opened
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
yes
!
But
I
ca
n't

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
help
you
to

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

n't
be
shifted

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
see
how
I
mean

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
to
where
a
swing-glass
stood
,
and
taking
it
in
her
hands
*NL*
carried
it
to
a
spot
by
the
window
where
it
could
catch
the
sunshine
,
*NL*
moving
the
glass
till
the
beams
were
reflected
into
Phillotson
's
*NL*
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
--
you
can
see
the
great
red
sun
now
!
''
she
said
.
``
And
I
am
*NL*
sure
it
will
cheer
you
--
I
do
so
hope
it
will
!
''
She
spoke
with
a
*NL*
childlike
,
repentant
kindness
,
as
if
she
could
not
do
too
much
for
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Phillotson
smiled
sadly
.
``
You
are
an
odd
creature
!
''
he
murmured
as
*NL*
the
sun
glowed
in
his
eyes
.
``
The
idea
of
your
coming
to
see
me
after
*NL*
what
has
passed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
let
us
go
back
upon
that
!
''
she
said
quickly
.
``
I
have
to
catch
*NL*
the
omnibus
for
the
train
,
as
Jude
does
n't
know
I
have
come
;
he
was
*NL*
out
when
I
started
;
so
I
must
return
home
almost
directly
.
Richard
,
*NL*
I
am
so
very
glad
you
are
better
.
You
do
n't
hate
me
,
do
you
?
You
*NL*
have
been
such
a
kind
friend
to
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
to
know
you
think
so

said
Phillotson
huskily
.
``
No

*NL*
I
do
n't
hate
you

*NL*
*NL*
It
grew
dusk
quickly
in
the
gloomy
room
during
their
intermittent
*NL*
chat
,
and
when
candles
were
brought
and
it
was
time
to
leave
she
put
*NL*
her
hand
in
his
or
rather
allowed
it
to
flit
through
his
;
for
she
was
*NL*
significantly
light
in
touch
.
She
had
nearly
closed
the
door
when
he
*NL*
said
,
``
Sue
!
''
He
had
noticed
that
,
in
turning
away
from
him
,
tears
*NL*
were
on
her
face
and
a
quiver
in
her
lip
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
bad
policy
to
recall
her
--
he
knew
it
while
he
pursued
it
.
*NL*
But
he
could
not
help
it
.
She
came
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sue
,
''
he
murmured
,
``
do
you
wish
to
make
it
up
,
and
stay
?
I
'll
*NL*
forgive
you
and
condone
everything
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
you
ca
n't
,
you
ca

''
she
said
hastily
.
``
You
ca
n't
condone
it
*NL*
now
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
HE
is
your
husband
now
,
in
effect
,
you
mean
,
of
course
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
assume
it
.
He
is
obtaining
a
divorce
from
his
wife
*NL*
Arabella
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
wife

It
is
altogether
news
to
me
that
he
has
a

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a
bad
marriage

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
yours

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
mine

He
is
not
doing
it
so
much
on
his
own
account
as
on
*NL*
hers
.
She
wrote
and
told
him
it
would
be
a
kindness
to
her
,
since
*NL*
then
she
could
marry
and
live
respectably

And
Jude
has
agreed

*NL*
``
A

yes

a

But
I
do
n't
like
the
sound
of
it

Sue

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

no

You
ca

me
back
now

been
so
wicked

as
to
do
*NL*
what
I
have
done
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
had
arisen
in
Sue
's
face
that
incipient
fright
which
showed
*NL*
itself
whenever
he
changed
from
friend
to
husband
,
and
which
made
her
*NL*
adopt
any
line
of
defence
against
marital
feeling
in
him
.
``
I
MUST
go
*NL*
now
.
I
'll
come
again

may
I
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thank

*NL*
thought

I
CAN
NOT

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
his
--
his
from
lips
to
heel
!
''
said
Phillotson
;
but
so
faintly
*NL*
that
in
closing
the
door
she
did
not
hear
it
.
The
dread
of
a
*NL*
reactionary
change
in
the
schoolmaster
's
sentiments
,
coupled
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
with
a
faint
shamefacedness
at
letting
even
him
know
*NL*
what
a
slipshod
lack
of
thoroughness
,
from
a
man
's
point
of
view
,
*NL*
characterized
her
transferred
allegiance
,
prevented
her
telling
him
*NL*
of
her
,
thus
far
,
incomplete
relations
with
Jude
;
and
Phillotson
lay
*NL*
writhing
like
a
man
in
hell
as
he
pictured
the
prettily
dressed
,
*NL*
maddening
compound
of
sympathy
and
averseness
who
bore
his
name
,
*NL*
returning
impatiently
to
the
home
of
her
lover
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gillingham
was
so
interested
in
Phillotson
's
affairs
,
and
so
*NL*
seriously
concerned
about
him
,
that
he
walked
up
the
hill-side
to
*NL*
Shaston
two
or
three
times
a
week
,
although
,
there
and
back
,
it
was
*NL*
a
journey
of
nine
miles
,
which
had
to
be
performed
between
tea
and
*NL*
supper
,
after
a
hard
day
's
work
in
school
.
When
he
called
on
the
*NL*
next
occasion
after
Sue
's
visit
his
friend
was
downstairs
,
and
*NL*
Gillingham
noticed
that
his
restless
mood
had
been
supplanted
by
a
*NL*
more
fixed
and
composed
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
been
here
since
you
called
last
,
''
said
Phillotson
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
Mrs.
Phillotson
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
You
have
made
it
up
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
...
She
just
came
,
patted
my
pillow
with
her
little
white
hand
,
*NL*
played
the
thoughtful
nurse
for
half
an
hour
,
and
went
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
I
'm
hanged
!
A
little
hussy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
nothing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
,
what
a
tantalizing
,
capricious
little
woman
!
If
she
were
*NL*
not
your
wife
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
not
;
she
's
another
man
's
except
in
name
and
law
.
And
I
have
*NL*
been
thinking
--
it
was
suggested
to
me
by
a
conversation
I
had
with
*NL*
her
--
that
,
in
kindness
to
her
,
I
ought
to
dissolve
the
legal
tie
*NL*
altogether
;
which
,
singularly
enough
,
I
think
I
can
do
,
now
she
has
*NL*
been
back
,
and
refused
my
request
to
stay
after
I
said
I
had
forgiven
*NL*
her
.
I
believe
that
fact
would
afford
me
opportunity
of
doing
it
,
*NL*
though
I
did
not
see
it
at
the
moment
.
What
's
the
use
of
keeping
*NL*
her
chained
on
to
me
if
she
does
n't
belong
to
me
?
I
know
--
I
feel
*NL*
absolutely
certain
--
that
she
would
welcome
my
taking
such
a
step
as
*NL*
the
greatest
charity
to
her
.
For
though
as
a
fellow-creature
she
*NL*
sympathizes
with
,
and
pities
me
,
and
even
weeps
for
me
,
as
a
husband
*NL*
she
can
not
endure
me
--
she
loathes
me
--
there
's
no
use
in
mincing
*NL*
words
--
she
loathes
me
,
and
my
only
manly
,
and
dignified
,
and
merciful
*NL*
course
is
to
complete
what
I
have
begun
...
And
for
worldly
reasons
,
*NL*
too
,
it
will
be
better
for
her
to
be
independent
.
I
have
hopelessly
*NL*
ruined
my
prospects
because
of
my
decision
as
to
what
was
best
for
*NL*
us
,
though
she
does
not
know
it
;
I
see
only
dire
poverty
ahead
from
*NL*
my
feet
to
the
grave
;
for
I
can
be
accepted
as
teacher
no
more
.
I
*NL*
shall
probably
have
enough
to
do
to
make
both
ends
meet
during
the
*NL*
remainder
of
my
life
,
now
my
occupation
's
gone
;
and
I
shall
be
*NL*
better
able
to
bear
it
alone
.
I
may
as
well
tell
you
that
what
has
*NL*
suggested
my
letting
her
go
is
some
news
she
brought
me
--
the
news
*NL*
that
Fawley
is
doing
the
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
he
had
a
spouse

too

A
queer
couple

these
lovers

*NL*
``
Well

I
do
n't
want
your
opinion
on
that

What
I
was
going
to
say
is
*NL*
that
my
liberating
her
can
do
her
no
possible
harm
,
and
will
open
up
*NL*
a
chance
of
happiness
for
her
which
she
has
never
dreamt
of
hitherto

For
then
they
'll
be
able

they
ought
to
have
done
at

first

*NL*
Gillingham
did
not
hurry
to
reply
.
``
I
may
disagree
with
your

he
said
gently

for
he
respected

not

How
Gillingham
's
doubts
were
disposed
of
will
most
quickly
appear
by
*NL*
passing
over
the
series
of
dreary
months
and
incidents
that
followed
*NL*
the
events
of
the
last
chapter
,
and
coming
on
to
a
Sunday
in
the
*NL*
February
of
the
year
following
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sue
and
Jude
were
living
in
Aldbrickham
,
in
precisely
the
same
*NL*
relations
that
they
had
established
between
themselves
when
she
*NL*
left
Shaston
to
join
him
the
year
before
.
The
proceedings
in
the
*NL*
law-courts
had
reached
their
consciousness
,
but
as
a
distant
sound
*NL*
and
an
occasional
missive
which
they
hardly
understood
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
met
,
as
usual
,
to
breakfast
together
in
the
little
house
*NL*
with
Jude
's
name
on
it
,
that
he
had
taken
at
fifteen
pounds
a
year
,
*NL*
with
three-pounds-ten
extra
for
rates
and
taxes
,
and
furnished
with
*NL*
his
aunt
's
ancient
and
lumbering
goods
,
which
had
cost
him
about
*NL*
their
full
value
to
bring
all
the
way
from
Marygreen
.
Sue
kept
*NL*
house
,
and
managed
everything
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
entered
the
room
this
morning
Sue
held
up
a
letter
she
had
just
*NL*
received
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
;
and
what
is
it
about
?
''
he
said
after
kissing
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
the
decree
_
nisi
_
in
the
case
of
Phillotson
_
versus
_
Phillotson
*NL*
and
Fawley
,
pronounced
six
months
ago
,
has
just
been
made
absolute
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Jude
,
as
he
sat
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
same
concluding
incident
in
Jude
's
suit
against
Arabella
had
*NL*
occurred
about
a
month
or
two
earlier
.
Both
cases
had
been
too
*NL*
insignificant
to
be
reported
in
the
papers
,
further
than
by
name
in
*NL*
a
long
list
of
other
undefended
cases
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
then
,
Sue
,
at
any
rate
,
you
can
do
what
you
like

He
looked
at
*NL*
his
sweetheart
curiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
we
--
you
and
I
--
just
as
free
now
as
if
we
had
never
married
at
*NL*
all
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
as
free

except
,
I
believe

that
a

may
object

personally
to
remarry
you
,
and
hand
the
job
on
to
somebody
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
wonder
--
do
you
think
it
is
really
so
with
us
?
I
know
it
is
*NL*
generally
.
But
I
have
an
uncomfortable
feeling
that
my
freedom
has
*NL*
been
obtained
under
false
pretences
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
if
the
truth
about
us
had
been
known
,
the
decree
would
n't
have
*NL*
been
pronounced
.
It
is
only
,
is
it
,
because
we
have
made
no
defence
,
*NL*
and
have
led
them
into
a
false
supposition
?
Therefore
is
my
freedom
*NL*
lawful
,
however
proper
it
may
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
why
did
you
let
it
be
under
false
pretences
?
You
have
only
*NL*
yourself
to
blame

''
he
said
mischievously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jude
--
do
n't
!
You
ought
not
to
be
touchy
about

still

You
must

take
me
as
I
am

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well

:
so
I
will
.
Perhaps
you
were
right
.
As
to
your
*NL*
question
,
we
were
not
obliged
to
prove
anything
.
That
was
their
*NL*
business
.
Anyhow
we
are
living
together

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

Though
not
in

*NL*
*NL*
``
One
thing
is
certain
,
that
however
the
decree
may
be
brought
*NL*
about

a
marriage
is
dissolved

it
is
dissolved

There
is
this

advantage
in
being
poor

that
these
things

done
for
us
in
a
rough
and
ready
fashion
.
It
was
the
same
with
me
*NL*
and
Arabella
.
I
was
afraid
her
criminal
second
marriage
would
have
*NL*
been
discovered
,
and
she
punished
;
but
nobody
took
any
interest
in
*NL*
her
--
nobody
inquired
,
nobody
suspected
it
.
If
we
'd
been
patented
*NL*
nobilities
we
should
have
had
infinite
trouble
,
and
days
and
weeks
*NL*
would
have
been
spent
in
investigations
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
degrees
Sue
acquired
her
lover
's
cheerfulness
at
the
sense
of
*NL*
freedom
,
and
proposed
that
they
should
take
a
walk
in
the
fields
,
*NL*
even
if
they
had
to
put
up
with
a
cold
dinner
on
account
of
it
.
*NL*
Jude
agreed
,
and
Sue
went
up-stairs
and
prepared
to
start
,
putting
*NL*
on
a
joyful
coloured
gown
in
observance
of
her
liberty
;
seeing
which
*NL*
Jude
put
on
a
lighter
tie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
we
'll
strut
arm
and
arm
,
''
he
said
,
``
like
any
other
engaged
*NL*
couple
.
We
've
a
legal
right
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
rambled
out
of
the
town
,
and
along
a
path
over
the
low-lying
*NL*
lands
that
bordered
it
,
though
these
were
frosty
now
,
and
the
*NL*
extensive
seed-fields
were
bare
of
colour
and
produce
.
The
pair
,
*NL*
however
,
were
so
absorbed
in
their
own
situation
that
their
*NL*
surroundings
were
little
in
their
consciousness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
dearest
,
the
result
of
all
this
is
that
we
can
marry
after
*NL*
a
decent
interval
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
suppose
we
can
,
''
said
Sue
,
without
enthusiasm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
are
n't
we
going
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
like
to
say
no
,
dear
Jude
;
but
I
feel
just
the
same
about
*NL*
it
now
as
I
have
done
all
along
.
I
have
just
the
same
dread
lest
an
*NL*
iron
contract
should
extinguish
your
tenderness
for
me
,
and
mine
for
*NL*
you
,
as
it
did
between
our
unfortunate
parents
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
,
what
can
we
do
?
I
do
love
you
,
as
you
know
,
Sue
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it
abundantly
.
But
I
think
I
would
much
rather
go
on
living
*NL*
always
as
lovers
,
as
we
are
living
now
,
and
only
meeting
by
day
.
It
*NL*
is
so
much
sweeter
--
for
the
woman
at
least
,
and
when
she
is
sure
of
*NL*
the
man
.
And
henceforward
we
need
n't
be
so
particular
as
we
have
*NL*
been
about
appearances
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
experiences
of
matrimony
with
others
have
not
been
encouraging
,
*NL*
I
own
,
''
said
he
,
with
some
gloom
;
``
either
owing
to
our
own
*NL*
dissatisfied
,
unpractical
natures
,
or
by
our
misfortune
.
But
we
*NL*
two
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Should
be
two
dissatisfied
ones
linked
together
,
which
would
be
*NL*
twice
as
bad
as
before
...
I
think
I
should
begin
to
be
afraid
of
*NL*
you
,
Jude
,
the
moment
you
had
contracted
to
cherish
me
under
a
*NL*
Government
stamp
,
and
I
was
licensed
to
be
loved
on
the
premises
by
*NL*
you
--
Ugh
,
how
horrible
and
sordid
!
Although
,
as
you
are
,
free
,
I
*NL*
trust
you
more
than
any
other
man
in
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
--
do
n't
say
I
should
change
!
''
he
expostulated
;
yet
there
was
*NL*
misgiving
in
his
own
voice
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Apart
from
ourselves
,
and
our
unhappy
peculiarities
,
it
is
foreign
*NL*
to
a
man
's
nature
to
go
on
loving
a
person
when
he
is
told
that
*NL*
he
must
and
shall
be
that
person
's
lover
.
There
would
be
a
much
*NL*
likelier
chance
of
his
doing
it
if
he
were
told
not
to
love
.
If
the
*NL*
marriage
ceremony
consisted
in
an
oath
and
signed
contract
between
*NL*
the
parties
to
cease
loving
from
that
day
forward
,
in
consideration
*NL*
of
personal
possession
being
given
,
and
to
avoid
each
other
's
society
*NL*
as
much
as
possible
in
public
,
there
would
be
more
loving
couples
*NL*
than
there
are
now
.
Fancy
the
secret
meetings
between
the
perjuring
*NL*
husband
and
wife
,
the
denials
of
having
seen
each
other
,
the
*NL*
clambering
in
at
bedroom
windows
,
and
the
hiding
in
closets
!
There
'd
*NL*
be
little
cooling
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
admitting
this
,
or
something
like
it
,
to
be
true
,
you
are
*NL*
not
the
only
one
in
the
world
to
see
it
,
dear
little
Sue
.
People
go
*NL*
on
marrying
because
they
ca
n't
resist
natural
forces
,
although
many
*NL*
of
them
may
know
perfectly
well
that
they
are
possibly
buying
a
*NL*
month
's
pleasure
with
a
life
's
discomfort
.
No
doubt
my
father
and
*NL*
mother
,
and
your
father
and
mother
,
saw
it
,
if
they
at
all
resembled
*NL*
us
in
habits
of
observation
.
But
then
they
went
and
married
just
the
*NL*
same
,
because
they
had
ordinary
passions
.
But
you
,
Sue
,
are
such
a
*NL*
phantasmal
,
bodiless
creature
,
one
who
--
if
you
'll
allow
me
to
say
*NL*
it
--
has
so
little
animal
passion
in
you
,
that
you
can
act
upon
reason
*NL*
in
the
matter
,
when
we
poor
unfortunate
wretches
of
grosser
substance
*NL*
ca
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
she
sighed
,
``
you
've
owned
that
it
would
probably
end
in
*NL*
misery
for
us
.
And
I
am
not
so
exceptional
a
woman
as
you
think
.
*NL*
Fewer
women
like
marriage
than
you
suppose
,
only
they
enter
into
it
*NL*
for
the
dignity
it
is
assumed
to
confer
,
and
the
social
advantages
*NL*
it
gains
them
sometimes
--
a
dignity
and
an
advantage
that
I
am
quite
*NL*
willing
to
do
without
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
fell
back
upon
his
old
complaint
--
that
,
intimate
as
they
were
,
*NL*
he
had
never
once
had
from
her
an
honest
,
candid
declaration
that
she
*NL*
loved
or
could
love
him
.
``
I
really
fear
sometimes
that
you
can
not
,
''
*NL*
he
said
,
with
a
dubiousness
approaching
anger
.
``
And
you
are
so
*NL*
reticent
.
I
know
that
women
are
taught
by
other
women
that
they
*NL*
must
never
admit
the
full
truth
to
a
man
.
But
the
highest
form
of
*NL*
affection
is
based
on
full
sincerity
on
both
sides
.
Not
being
men
,
*NL*
these
women
do
n't
know
that
in
looking
back
on
those
he
has
had
*NL*
tender
relations
with
,
a
man
's
heart
returns
closest
to
her
who
*NL*
was
the
soul
of
truth
in
her
conduct
.
The
better
class
of
man
,
*NL*
even
if
caught
by
airy
affectations
of
dodging
and
parrying
,
is
not
*NL*
retained
by
them
.
A
Nemesis
attends
the
woman
who
plays
the
game
of
*NL*
elusiveness
too
often
,
in
the
utter
contempt
for
her
that
,
sooner
*NL*
or
later
,
her
old
admirers
feel
;
under
which
they
allow
her
to
go
*NL*
unlamented
to
her
grave
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sue
,
who
was
regarding
the
distance
,
had
acquired
a
guilty
look
;
and
*NL*
she
suddenly
replied
in
a
tragic
voice
:
``
I
do
n't
think
I
like
you
*NL*
to-day
so
well
as
I
did
,
Jude
!

``
Do
n't
you
?
Why
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well

you
are
not
nice

too
sermony
.
Though
I
suppose
I
am
so
*NL*
bad
and
worthless
that
I
deserve
the
utmost
rigour
of
lecturing
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

an
eel

when
I
want
to
get
a
confession
from
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
I
am
bad
,
and
obstinate
,
and
all
sorts
!
It
is
no
use
your
*NL*
pretending
I
am
not
!
People
who
are
good
do
n't
want
scolding
as
I
*NL*
do
...
But
now
that
I
have
nobody
but
you
,
and
nobody
to
defend
me
,
*NL*
it
is
very
hard
that
I
must
n't
have
my
own
way
in
deciding
how
I
'll
*NL*
live
with
you
,
and
whether
I
'll
be
married
or
no

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sue
,
my
own
comrade
and
sweetheart
,
I
do
n't
want
to
force
you
either
*NL*
to
marry
or
to
do
the
other
thing
--
of
course
I
do
n't
!
It
is
too
*NL*
wicked
of
you
to
be
so
pettish

Now
we
wo
n't
say
any
more
about
it

*NL*
and
go
on
just
the
same
as
we
have
done
;
and
during
the
rest
of
our
*NL*
walk
we
'll
talk
of
the
meadows
only
,
and
the
floods
,
and
the
prospect
*NL*
of
the
farmers
this
coming
year

''
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
the
subject
of
marriage
was
not
mentioned
by
them
for
*NL*
several
days
,
though
living
as
they
were
with
only
a
landing
between
*NL*
them
it
was
constantly
in
their
minds
.
Sue
was
assisting
Jude
very
*NL*
materially
now
:
he
had
latterly
occupied
himself
on
his
own
account
*NL*
in
working
and
lettering
headstones
,
which
he
kept
in
a
little
yard
*NL*
at
the
back
of
his
little
house
,
where
in
the
intervals
of
domestic
*NL*
duties
she
marked
out
the
letters
full
size
for
him
,
and
blacked
them
*NL*
in
after
he
had
cut
them
.
It
was
a
lower
class
of
handicraft
than
*NL*
were
his
former
performances
as
a
cathedral
mason
,
and
his
only
*NL*
patrons
were
the
poor
people
who
lived
in
his
own
neighbourhood
,
*NL*
and
knew
what
a
cheap
man
this
``
Jude

Monumental
Mason

-LRB-
as
he
called
himself
on
his
front
door
-RRB-
was
to
employ
for
the
*NL*
simple
memorials
they
required
for
their
dead
.
But
he
seemed
more
*NL*
independent
than
before
,
and
it
was
the
only
arrangement
under
which
*NL*
Sue
,
who
particularly
wished
to
be
no
burden
on
him
,
could
render
any
*NL*
assistance
.

II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
an
evening
at
the
end
of
the
month
,
and
Jude
had
just
returned
*NL*
home
from
hearing
a
lecture
on
ancient
history
in
the
public
hall
not
*NL*
far
off
.
When
he
entered
,
Sue
,
who
had
been
keeping
indoors
during
*NL*
his
absence
,
laid
out
supper
for
him
.
Contrary
to
custom
she
did
not
*NL*
speak
.
Jude
had
taken
up
some
illustrated
paper
,
which
he
perused
*NL*
till
,
raising
his
eyes
,
he
saw
that
her
face
was
troubled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
depressed
,
Sue
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
paused
a
moment
.
``
I
have
a
message
for
you
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Somebody
has
called
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
A
woman
.
''
Sue
's
voice
quavered
as
she
spoke
,
and
she
suddenly
*NL*
sat
down
from
her
preparations
,
laid
her
hands
in
her
lap
,
and
looked
*NL*
into
the
fire
.
``
I
do
n't
know
whether
I
did
right
or
not
!
''
she
*NL*
continued
.
``
I
said
you
were
not
at
home
,
and
when
she
said
she
would
*NL*
wait
,
I
said
I
thought
you
might
not
be
able
to
see
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
you
say
that
,
dear
?
I
suppose
she
wanted
a
headstone
.
Was
*NL*
she
in
mourning
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
She
was
n't
in
mourning
,
and
she
did
n't
want
a
headstone
;
and
I
*NL*
thought
you
could
n't
see
her

Sue
looked
critically
and
imploringly
*NL*
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
who
was
she
?
Did
n't
she
say
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

She
would
n't
give
her
name
.
But
I
know
who
she
was

I
think
I
*NL*
do
!
It
was
Arabella
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heaven
save
us
!
What
should
Arabella
come
for

made
you
think

it
was

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
can
hardly
tell

But
I
know
it
was

I
feel
perfectly
certain
*NL*
it
was

by
the
light
in
her
eyes
as
she
looked
at
me
.
She
was
a
*NL*
fleshy
,
coarse
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
I
should
not
have
called
Arabella
coarse
exactly
,
except
in
*NL*
speech
,
though
she
may
be
getting
so
by
this
time
under
the
duties
of
*NL*
the
public
house
.
She
was
rather
handsome
when
I
knew
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Handsome
!
But
yes
!
--
so
she
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
heard
a
quiver
in
your
little
mouth
.
Well
,
waiving
that
,
*NL*
as
she
is
nothing
to
me
,
and
virtuously
married
to
another
man
,
why
*NL*
should
she
come
troubling
us
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
sure
she
's
married
?
Have
you
definite
news
of
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
not
definite
news

But
that
was
why
she
asked
me
to
release
*NL*
her

She
and
the
man
both
wanted
to
lead
a
proper
life
,
as
I
*NL*
understood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
Jude

it
was

WAS
Arabella

cried
Sue
,
covering
her
eyes
*NL*
with
her
hand
.
``
And
I
am
so
miserable

It
seems
such
an
ill
omen

whatever
she
may

come
for

possibly
see
her

you

``

do

really

so
very

talk

now

for

as
much
as

However

she
's
gone

say

would
come
again

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

she
went
away
very
reluctantly

*NL*
*NL*
Sue
,
whom
the
least
thing
upset
,
could
not
eat
any
supper
,
and
when
*NL*
Jude
had
finished
his
he
prepared
to
go
to
bed
.
He
had
no
sooner
*NL*
raked
out
the
fire
,
fastened
the
doors
,
and
got
to
the
top
of
the
*NL*
stairs
than
there
came
a
knock
.
Sue
instantly
emerged
from
her
room
,
*NL*
which
she
had
but
just
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
she
is
again
!
''
Sue
whispered
in
appalled
accents
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
knocked
like
that
last
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
listened
,
and
the
knocking
came
again
.
No
servant
was
kept
in
*NL*
the
house
,
and
if
the
summons
were
to
be
responded
to
one
of
them
*NL*
would
have
to
do
it
in
person
.
``
I
'll
open
a
window
,
''
said
Jude
.
*NL*
``
Whoever
it
is
can
not
be
expected
to
be
let
in
at
this
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
accordingly
went
into
his
bedroom
and
lifted
the
sash
.
The
lonely
*NL*
street
of
early
retiring
workpeople
was
empty
from
end
to
end
save
of
*NL*
one
figure
--
that
of
a
woman
walking
up
and
down
by
the
lamp
a
few
*NL*
yards
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
there
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
Mr.
Fawley
?
''
came
up
from
the
woman
,
in
a
voice
which
was
*NL*
unmistakably
Arabella
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
replied
that
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
she
?
''
asked
Sue
from
the
door
,
with
lips
apart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
dear
,
''
said
Jude
.
``
What
do
you
want
,
Arabella
?
''
he
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Jude
,
for
disturbing
you
,
''
said
Arabella
humbly
.
*NL*
``
But
I
called
earlier
--
I
wanted
particularly
to
see
you
to-night
,
if
*NL*
I
could
.
I
am
in
trouble
,
and
have
nobody
to
help
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
trouble
,
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
silence
.
An
inconvenient
sympathy
seemed
to
be
rising
in
*NL*
Jude
's
breast
at
the
appeal
.
``
But
are
n't
you
married
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arabella
hesitated
.
``
No
,
Jude
,
I
am
not
,
''
she
returned
.
``
He
*NL*
would
n't
,
after
all
.
And
I
am
in
great
difficulty
.
I
hope
to
get
*NL*
another
situation
as
barmaid
soon
.
But
it
takes
time
,
and
I
really
*NL*
am
in
great
distress
because
of
a
sudden
responsibility
that
's
been
*NL*
sprung
upon
me
from
Australia
;
or
I
would
n't
trouble
you
--
believe
me
*NL*
I
would
n't
.
I
want
to
tell
you
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sue
remained
at
gaze
,
in
painful
tension
,
hearing
every
word
,
but
*NL*
speaking
none
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
really
in
want
of
money
,
Arabella
?
''
he
asked
,
in
a
*NL*
distinctly
softened
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
enough
to
pay
for
the
night
's
lodging
I
have
obtained
,
but
*NL*
barely
enough
to
take
me
back
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
you
living
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
London
still
.
''
She
was
about
to
give
the
address
,
but
she
*NL*
said
,
``
I
am
afraid
somebody
may
hear
,
so
I
do
n't
like
to
call
out
*NL*
particulars
of
myself
so
loud
.
If
you
could
come
down
and
walk
*NL*
a
little
way
with
me
towards
the
Prince
Inn
,
where
I
am
staying
*NL*
to-night
,
I
would
explain
all
.
You
may
as
well
,
for
old
time
's
*NL*
sake
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
thing
!
I
must
do
her
the
kindness
of
hearing
what
's
the
*NL*
matter
,
I
suppose
,
''
said
Jude
in
much
perplexity
.
``
As
she
's
going
*NL*
back
to-morrow
it
ca
n't
make
much
difference
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
can
go
and
see
her
to-morrow
,
Jude
!
Do
n't
go
now
,
Jude
!
''
*NL*
came
in
plaintive
accents
from
the
doorway
.
``
Oh
,
it
is
only
to
*NL*
entrap
you
,
I
know
it
is
,
as
she
did
before
!
Do
n't
go
,
dear
!
She
is
*NL*
such
a
low-passioned
woman
--
I
can
see
it
in
her
shape
,
and
hear
it
in
*NL*
her
voice
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
shall
go
,
''
said
Jude
.
``
Do
n't
attempt
to
detain
me
,
Sue
.
God
*NL*
knows
I
love
her
little
enough
now
,
but
I
do
n't
want
to
be
cruel
to
*NL*
her
.
''
He
turned
to
the
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
she
's
not
your
wife
!
''
cried
Sue
distractedly
.
``
And
I
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
are
not
either
,
dear
,
yet
,

said
Jude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
are
you
going
to
her
?
Do
n't
!
Stay
at
home
!
Please
,
please
*NL*
stay
at
home
,
Jude
,
and
not
go
to
her
,
now
she
's
not
your
wife
any
*NL*
more
than
I
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
she
is
,
rather
more
than
you
,
come
to
that
,
''
he
said
,
taking
*NL*
his
hat
determinedly
.
``
I
've
wanted
you
to
be
,
and
I
've
waited
with
*NL*
the
patience
of
Job
,
and
I
do
n't
see
that
I
've
got
anything
by
my
*NL*
self-denial
.
I
shall
certainly
give
her
something
,
and
hear
what
it
*NL*
is
she
is
so
anxious
to
tell
me
;
no
man
could
do
less
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
that
in
his
manner
which
she
knew
it
would
be
futile
to
*NL*
oppose
.
She
said
no
more
,
but
,
turning
to
her
room
as
meekly
as
a
*NL*
martyr
,
heard
him
go
downstairs
,
unbolt
the
door
,
and
close
it
*NL*
behind
him
.
With
a
woman
's
disregard
of
her
dignity
when
in
the
*NL*
presence
of
nobody
but
herself
,
she
also
trotted
down
,
sobbing
*NL*
articulately
as
she
went
.
She
listened
.
She
knew
exactly
how
far
*NL*
it
was
to
the
inn
that
Arabella
had
named
as
her
lodging
.
It
would
*NL*
occupy
about
seven
minutes
to
get
there
at
an
ordinary
walking
pace
;
*NL*
seven
to
come
back
again
.
If
he
did
not
return
in
fourteen
minutes
*NL*
he
would
have
lingered
.
She
looked
at
the
clock
.
It
was
twenty-five
*NL*
minutes
to
eleven
.
He
MIGHT
enter
the
inn
with
Arabella
,
as
they
*NL*
would
reach
it
before
closing
time
;
she
might
get
him
to
drink
with
*NL*
her
;
and
Heaven
only
knew
what
disasters
would
befall
him
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
still
suspense
she
waited
on
.
It
seemed
as
if
the
whole
time
*NL*
had
nearly
elapsed
when
the
door
was
opened
again
,
and
Jude
appeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sue
gave
a
little
ecstatic
cry
.
``
Oh
,
I
knew
I
could
trust
you
!
--
how
*NL*
good
you
are
!
''
--
she
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
find
her
anywhere
in
this
street
,
and
I
went
out
in
my
*NL*
slippers
only
.
She
has
walked
on
,
thinking
I
've
been
so
hard-hearted
*NL*
as
to
refuse
her
requests
entirely
,
poor
woman
.
I
've
come
back
for
*NL*
my
boots
,
as
it
is
beginning
to
rain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
why
should
you
take
such
trouble
for
a
woman
who
has
served
*NL*
you
so
badly
!
''
said
Sue
in
a
jealous
burst
of
disappointment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Sue
,
she
's
a
woman
,
and
I
once
cared
for
her
;
and
one
ca
n't
be
*NL*
a
brute
in
such
circumstances
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
n't
your
wife
any
longer
!
''
exclaimed
Sue
,
passionately
*NL*
excited
.
``
You
MUST
N'T
go
out
to
find
her
!
It
is
n't
right
!
You
*NL*
CA
N'T
join
her
,
now
she
's
a
stranger
to
you
.
How
can
you
forget
such
*NL*
a
thing
,
my
dear
,
dear
one
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
seems
much
the
same
as
ever
--
an
erring
,
careless
,
unreflecting
*NL*
fellow-creature
,
''
he
said
,
continuing
to
pull
on
his
boots
.
``
What
*NL*
those
legal
fellows
have
been
playing
at
in
London
makes
no
*NL*
difference
in
my
real
relations
to
her
.
If
she
was
my
wife
while
*NL*
she
was
away
in
Australia
with
another
husband
,
she
's
my
wife
now

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
she
was

That
's
just
what
I
hold

There
's
the
absurdity

Well
--
you
'll
come
straight
back
,
after
a
few
minutes
,
wo
n't
you
,
*NL*
dear
?
She
is
too
low
,
too
coarse
for
you
to
talk
to
long

Jude
,
and
*NL*
was
always
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
I
am
coarse
too
,
worse
luck
!
I
have
the
germs
of
every
*NL*
human
infirmity
in
me
,
I
verily
believe
--
that
was
why
I
saw
it
was
*NL*
so
preposterous
of
me
to
think
of
being
a
curate
.
I
have
cured
*NL*
myself
of
drunkenness
I
think
;
but
I
never
know
in
what
new
form
a
*NL*
suppressed
vice
will
break
out
in
me
!
I
do
love
you
,
Sue
,
though
I
*NL*
have
danced
attendance
on
you
so
long
for
such
poor
returns
!
All
*NL*
that
's
best
and
noblest
in
me
loves
you
,
and
your
freedom
from
*NL*
everything
that
's
gross
has
elevated
me

enabled
me

do
what

I
should
never
have
dreamt
myself
capable
of
,
or
any
man
,
a
year
*NL*
or
two
ago

It
is
all
very
well
to
preach
about
self-control
,
and
*NL*
the
wickedness
of
coercing
a
woman

But
I
should
just
like
a
few
*NL*
virtuous
people
who
have
condemned
me
in
the
past

about
Arabella

other
things

have
been
in
my
tantalizing
position
with
*NL*
you
through
these
late
weeks

they

believe

I
think

that
I

have
exercised
some
little
restraint
in
always
giving
in

your

living
here

She
ran
across
and
flung
her
arms
round
his
neck
.

``
Yes

embracing
Sue
softly

``
I
do
feel

be
unfair

unfair

She

not

Do

any

There

there

there

He
kissed
her
on
one
side
,
and
on
the
other
,
and
in
the
*NL*
middle
,
and
rebolted
the
front
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
it
was
wet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now

said
Jude
gaily
at
breakfast
;
``
as
this
is
Saturday
*NL*
I

to
call
about
the
banns
at
once

so
as
to
get
the
first

publishing
done
to-morrow
,
or
we
shall
lose
a
week

Banns
will
do
?
*NL*
We
shall
save
a
pound
or
two

''
*NL*
*NL*
Sue
absently
agreed
to
banns
.
But
her
mind
for
the
moment
was
*NL*
running
on
something
else
.
A
glow
had
passed
away
from
her
,
and
*NL*
depression
sat
upon
her
features
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
feel
I
was
wickedly
selfish
last
night
!
''
she
murmured
.
``
It
was
*NL*
sheer
unkindness
in
me
--
or
worse
--
to
treat
Arabella
as
I
did

I
*NL*
did
n't
care
about
her
being
in
trouble

and
what
she
wished
to
tell
*NL*
you

Perhaps
it
was
really
something
she
was
justified
in
telling
*NL*
you

That
's
some
more
of
my
badness
,
I
suppose
!
Love
has
its
own
*NL*
dark
morality
when
rivalry
enters
in

at

,
mine
has

if
other
*NL*
people
's
has

I
wonder
how
she
got
on

I

reached
the

inn
all
right

poor
woman

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes

she
got
on

placidly

hope
she
was
n't
shut
out
,
and
that
she
had
n't
to
walk
the
streets
*NL*
in
the
rain
.
Do
you
mind
my
putting
on
my
waterproof
and
going
to
*NL*
see
if
she
got
in
?
I
've
been
thinking
of
her
all
the
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
is
it
necessary
?
You
have
n't
the
least
idea
how
Arabella
is
*NL*
able
to
shift
for
herself
.
Still
,
darling
,
if
you
want
to
go
and
*NL*
inquire
you
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
limit
to
the
strange
and
unnecessary
penances
which
Sue
*NL*
would
meekly
undertake
when
in
a
contrite
mood
;
and
this
going
to
*NL*
see
all
sorts
of
extraordinary
persons
whose
relation
to
her
was
*NL*
precisely
of
a
kind
that
would
have
made
other
people
shun
them
was
*NL*
her
instinct
ever
,
so
that
the
request
did
not
surprise
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
when
you
come
back
,
''
he
added
,
``
I
'll
be
ready
to
go
about
the
*NL*
banns
.
You
'll
come
with
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sue
agreed
,
and
went
off
under
cloak
and
umbrella
letting
Jude
kiss
*NL*
her
freely
,
and
returning
his
kisses
in
a
way
she
had
never
done
*NL*
before
.
Times
had
decidedly
changed
.
``
The
little
bird
is
caught
at
*NL*
last
!
''
she
said
,
a
sadness
showing
in
her
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
only
nested
,
''
he
assured
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
walked
along
the
muddy
street
till
she
reached
the
public
house
*NL*
mentioned
by
Arabella
,
which
was
not
so
very
far
off
.
She
was
*NL*
informed
that
Arabella
had
not
yet
left
,
and
in
doubt
how
to
announce
*NL*
herself
so
that
her
predecessor
in
Jude
's
affections
would
recognize
*NL*
her
,
she
sent
up
word
that
a
friend
from
Spring
Street
had
called
,
*NL*
naming
the
place
of
Jude
's
residence
.
She
was
asked
to
step
*NL*
upstairs
,
and
on
being
shown
into
a
room
found
that
it
was
Arabella
's
*NL*
bedroom
,
and
that
the
latter
had
not
yet
risen
.
She
halted
on
the
*NL*
turn
of
her
toe
till
Arabella
cried
from
the
bed
,
``
Come
in
and
shut
*NL*
the
door
,
''
which
Sue
accordingly
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arabella
lay
facing
the
window
,
and
did
not
at
once
turn
her
head
:
*NL*
and
Sue
was
wicked
enough
,
despite
her
penitence
,
to
wish
for
a
*NL*
moment
that
Jude
could
behold
her
forerunner
now
,
with
the
daylight
*NL*
full
upon
her
.
She
may
have
seemed
handsome
enough
in
profile
under
*NL*
the
lamps
,
but
a
frowsiness
was
apparent
this
morning
;
and
the
sight
*NL*
of
her
own
fresh
charms
in
the
looking-glass
made
Sue
's
manner
*NL*
bright
,
till
she
reflected
what
a
meanly
sexual
emotion
this
was
in
*NL*
her
,
and
hated
herself
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
just
looked
in
to
see
if
you
got
back
comfortably
last
night
,
*NL*
that
's
all
,
''
she
said
gently
.
``
I
was
afraid
afterwards
that
you
*NL*
might
have
met
with
any
mishap
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
how
stupid
this
is
!
I
thought
my
visitor
was
--
your
friend
--
your
*NL*
husband
--
Mrs.
Fawley
,
as
I
suppose
you
call
yourself
?
''
said
Arabella
,
*NL*
flinging
her
head
back
upon
the
pillows
with
a
disappointed
toss
,
and
*NL*
ceasing
to
retain
the
dimple
she
had
just
taken
the
trouble
to
*NL*
produce
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
I
do
n't
,
''
said
Sue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
thought
you
might
have
,
even
if
he
's
not
really
yours

*NL*
Decency
is
decency
,
any
hour
of
the
twenty-four
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
you
mean

''
said
Sue
stiffly
.
``
He
is
mine
,
if
you
*NL*
come
to
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
n't
yesterday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sue
coloured
roseate
,
and
said
,
``
How
do
you
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
your
manner
when
you
talked
to
me
at
the
door
.
Well
,
my
dear
,
*NL*
you
've
been
quick
about
it
,
and
I
expect
my
visit
last
night
helped
*NL*
it
on
--
ha-ha
!
But
I
do
n't
want
to
get
him
away
from
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sue
looked
out
at
the
rain
,
and
at
the
dirty
toilet-cover
,
and
at
the
*NL*
detached
tail
of
Arabella
's
hair
hanging
on
the
looking-glass
,
just
*NL*
as
it
had
done
in
Jude
's
time
;
and
wished
she
had
not
come
.
In
the
*NL*
pause
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
,
and
the
chambermaid
brought
in
a
*NL*
telegram
for
``
Mrs.
Cartlett
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Arabella
opened
it
as
she
lay
,
and
her
ruffled
look
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
anxiety
about
me
,
''
she
said
*NL*
blandly
when
the
maid
had
gone
;
``
but
it
is
not
necessary
you
should
*NL*
feel
it
.
My
man
finds
he
ca
n't
do
without
me
after
all
,
and
agrees
*NL*
to
stand
by
the
promise
to
marry
again
over
here
that
he
has
made
me
*NL*
all
along
.
See
here
!
This
is
in
answer
to
one
from
me
.
''
She
held
*NL*
out
the
telegram
for
Sue
to
read
,
but
Sue
did
not
take
it
.
``
He
asks
*NL*
me
to
come
back
.
His
little
corner
public
in
Lambeth
would
go
to
*NL*
pieces
without
me
,
he
says
.
But
he
is
n't
going
to
knock
me
about
*NL*
when
he
has
had
a
drop
,
any
more
after
we
are
spliced
by
English
law
*NL*
than
before
!
...
As
for
you
,
I
should
coax
Jude
to
take
me
before
*NL*
the
parson
straight
off
,
and
have
done
with
it
,
if
I
were
in
your
*NL*
place
.
I
say
it
as
a
friend
,
my
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
waiting
to
,
any
day

''
returned
Sue
,
with
frigid
pride
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
let
him
,
in
Heaven
's
name
.
Life
with
a
man
is
more
*NL*
businesslike
after
it
,
and
money
matters
work
better
.
And
then
,
you
*NL*
see
,
if
you
have
rows
,
and
he
turns
you
out
of
doors
,
you
can
get
the
*NL*
law
to
protect
you
,
which
you
ca
n't
otherwise
,
unless
he
half-runs
*NL*
you
through
with
a
knife
,
or
cracks
your
noddle
with
a
poker
.
And
*NL*
if
he
bolts
away
from
you
--
I
say
it
friendly
,
as
woman
to
woman
,
for
*NL*
there
's
never
any
knowing
what
a

do

you
'll
have
the
sticks

o

furniture
,

wo
n't
be
looked
upon
as
a
thief
.
I
shall
marry
my
*NL*
man
over
again
,
now
he
's
willing
,
as
there
was
a
little
flaw
in
the
*NL*
first
ceremony
.
In
my
telegram
last
night
which
this
is
an
answer
*NL*
to
,
I
told
him
I
had
almost
made
it
up
with
Jude
;
and
that
frightened
*NL*
him
,
I
expect
!
Perhaps
I
should
quite
have
done
it
if
it
had
n't
been
*NL*
for
you
,
''
she
said
laughing
;
``
and
then
how
different
our
histories
*NL*
might
have
been
from
to-day

Never
such
a
tender
fool
as
Jude
is
if
*NL*
a
woman
seems
in
trouble
,
and
coaxes
him
a
bit
!
Just
as
he
used
to
*NL*
be
about
birds
and
things
.
However
,
as
it
happens
,
it
is
just
as
*NL*
well
as
if
I
had
made
it
up
,

I
forgive
you

And
,
as
I
say
,
I
'd
*NL*
advise
you
to
get
the
business
legally
done
as
soon
as
possible

You
'll
find
it
an
awful
bother

on

you
do

*NL*
``
I
have
told
you

is
asking
me
to
marry
him

to
make
our
natural
*NL*
marriage
a
legal
one

said
Sue
,
with
yet
more
dignity
.
``
It
was
*NL*
quite
by
my
wish
that
he
did

the

I
was
free

*NL*
``
Ah

yes

you
are
a

Arabella
,
eyeing
*NL*
her
visitor
with
humorous
criticism

``
Bolted
from
your
first

did
n't
*NL*
you

like
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
Good

must
go

said
Sue
hastily

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I

too

must
up

off

replied
the
other
,
springing
out
of
*NL*
bed
so
suddenly
that
the
soft
parts
of
her
person
shook
.
Sue
jumped
*NL*
aside
in
trepidation
.
``
Lord
,
I
am
only
a
woman

not
a
six-foot
*NL*
sojer
!
...
Just
a
moment

she
continued
,
putting
her
hand
on
*NL*
Sue
's
arm
.
``
I
really
did
want
to
consult
Jude
on
a
little
matter
of
*NL*
business
,
as
I
told
him

I
came
about
that
more
than
anything
else

*NL*
Would
he
run
up
to
speak
to
me
at
the
station
as
I
am
going
?
You
*NL*
think
not

Well

I
'll
write
to
him
about
it

I
will

When
Sue
reached
home
Jude
was
awaiting
her
at
the
door
to
take
the
*NL*
initial
step
towards
their
marriage
.
She
clasped
his
arm
,
and
they
*NL*
went
along
silently
together
,
as
true
comrades
oft-times
do
.
He
saw
*NL*
that
she
was
preoccupied
,
and
forbore
to
question
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
Jude
--
I
've
been
talking
to
her
,
''
she
said
at
last
.
``
I
wish
I
*NL*
had
n't
!
And
yet
it
is
best
to
be
reminded
of
things
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
she
was
civil
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

I
--
I
ca
n't
help
liking
her

just
a
little
bit
!
She
's
not
*NL*
an
ungenerous
nature
;
and
I
am
so
glad
her
difficulties
have
all
*NL*
suddenly
ended
.
''
She
explained
how
Arabella
had
been
summoned
back
,
*NL*
and
would
be
enabled
to
retrieve
her
position
.
``
I
was
referring
*NL*
to
our
old
question
.
What
Arabella
has
been
saying
to
me
has
made
*NL*
me
feel
more
than
ever
how
hopelessly
vulgar
an
institution
legal
*NL*
marriage
is
--
a
sort
of
trap
to
catch
a
man
--
I
ca
n't
bear
to
think
*NL*
of
it
.
I
wish
I
had
n't
promised
to
let
you
put
up
the
banns
this
*NL*
morning
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

do
n't

me

Any

like
to
get
it
over
quickly

now

*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed

I
do
n't
feel
any
more
anxious
now

I
did
before

*NL*
Perhaps
with
any

man
I
might
be
a
little
anxious
;
but
among
the
*NL*
very
few
virtues
possessed
by
your
family
and
mine
,
dear

I
think
I
*NL*
may
set
staunchness
.
So
I
am
not
a
bit
frightened
about
losing
you
,
*NL*
now
I
really
am
yours
and
you
really
are
mine

In
fact
,
I
am
easier

in
my
mind
than
I
was
,
for
my
conscience
is
clear
about
Richard
,
who
*NL*
now
has
a
right

freedom

deceiving

``
Sue

you
seem
when
you
are
like
this
to
be
one
of
the
women

some

grand
old
civilization

whom
I
used
to
read
about
in
my
bygone
,
*NL*
wasted

classical
days
,
rather
than
a
denizen
of
a
mere
Christian

I
almost
expect
you
to
say
at
these
times
that
you

the
Via

about

watching
Praxiteles
chiselling
away

at
his
latest
Venus

Phryne
made
complaint

tired

They
had
now
reached
the
house

parish
clerk

Sue
stood
back

*NL*
while
her
lover
went
up
to
the
door

His
hand
was
raised
to
knock
*NL*
when
she
said
:
``
Jude
!

*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
a
minute

would
you

*NL*
*NL*
He
came
back
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
let
us
think
,

she
said
timidly
.
``
I
had
such
a
horrid
dream
*NL*
one
night
!

And
Arabella

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
Arabella
say
to
you

he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

she
said
that
when
people
were
tied
up
you
could
get

the

he
beat
you

how

quarrelled

Jude

do
you

when
you
must
have
me
with

you
by
law

we
shall
be
so
happy

The

are
very
generous
when
everything
depends
upon
their

goodwill

they
always
kick
against
compulsion

Do

you
*NL*
dread
the
attitude
that
insensibly
arises
out
of
legal
obligation

Do

you

destructive

its

gratuitousness

Upon

go
back

Her
face
brightened

``
Yes

so
we

said
she

And
they
turned
*NL*
from
the
clerk

door

Sue
taking
his
arm
and
murmuring
as
they

walked
on
homeward

Can
you
keep

ranging

from
changing

*NL*
No
!
Nor
fetter
'd
love
...
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
They
thought
it
over
,
or
postponed
thinking
.
Certainly
they
*NL*
postponed
action
,
and
seemed
to
live
on
in
a
dreamy
paradise
.
*NL*
At
the
end
of
a
fortnight
or
three
weeks
matters
remained
unadvanced
,
*NL*
and
no
banns
were
announced
to
the
ears
of
any
Aldbrickham
*NL*
congregation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whilst
they
were
postponing
and
postponing
thus
a
letter
and
a
*NL*
newspaper
arrived
before
breakfast
one
morning
from
Arabella
.
*NL*
Seeing
the
handwriting
Jude
went
up
to
Sue
's
room
and
told
her
,
*NL*
and
as
soon
as
she
was
dressed
she
hastened
down
.
Sue
opened
the
*NL*
newspaper
;
Jude
the
letter
.
After
glancing
at
the
paper
she
held
*NL*
across
the
first
page
to
him
with
her
finger
on
a
paragraph
;
but
he
*NL*
was
so
absorbed
in
his
letter
that
he
did
not
turn
awhile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
!
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
and
read
.
The
paper
was
one
that
circulated
in
South
*NL*
London
only
,
and
the
marked
advertisement
was
simply
the
announcement
*NL*
of
a
marriage
at
St.
John
's
Church
,
Waterloo
Road
,
under
the
names
,
*NL*
``
CARTLETT
--
DONN
''
;
the
united
pair
being
Arabella
and
the
inn-keeper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
is
satisfactory
,
''
said
Sue
complacently
.
``
Though
,
after
*NL*
this
,
it
seems
rather
low
to
do
likewise
,
and
I
am
glad
.
However
,
*NL*
she
is
provided
for
now
in
a
way
,
I
suppose
,
whatever
her
faults
,
*NL*
poor
thing
.
It
is
nicer
that
we
are
able
to
think
that
,
than
to
be
*NL*
uneasy
about
her
.
I
ought
,
too
,
to
write
to
Richard
and
ask
him
how
*NL*
he
is
getting
on
,
perhaps
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Jude
's
attention
was
still
absorbed
.
Having
merely
glanced
*NL*
at
the
announcement
he
said
in
a
disturbed
voice
:
``
Listen
to
this
*NL*
letter
.
What
shall
I
say
or
do
?

THE
THREE
HORNS
,
LAMBETH
.
*NL*
*NL*
DEAR
JUDE
-LRB-
I
wo
n't
be
so
distant
as
to
call
you
Mr.
*NL*
Fawley
-RRB-
,
--
I
send
to-day
a
newspaper
,
from
which
useful
*NL*
document
you
will
learn
that
I
was
married
over
again
to
*NL*
Cartlett
last
Tuesday
.
So
that
business
is
settled
right
*NL*
and
tight
at
last
.
But
what
I
write
about
more
particular
*NL*
is
that
private
affair
I
wanted
to
speak
to
you
on
when
I
*NL*
came
down
to
Aldbrickham
.
I
could
n't
very
well
tell
it
to
*NL*
your
lady
friend
,
and
should
much
have
liked
to
let
you
*NL*
know
it
by
word
of
mouth
,
as
I
could
have
explained
better
*NL*
than
by
letter
.
The
fact
is
,
Jude
,
that
,
though
I
have
*NL*
never
informed
you
before
,
there
was
a
boy
born
of
our
*NL*
marriage
,
eight
months
after
I
left
you
,
when
I
was
at
*NL*
Sydney
,
living
with
my
father
and
mother
.
All
that
is
*NL*
easily
provable
.
As
I
had
separated
from
you
before
I
*NL*
thought
such
a
thing
was
going
to
happen
,
and
I
was
over
*NL*
there
,
and
our
quarrel
had
been
sharp
,
I
did
not
think
it
*NL*
convenient
to
write
about
the
birth
.
I
was
then
looking
*NL*
out
for
a
good
situation
,
so
my
parents
took
the
child
,
*NL*
and
he
has
been
with
them
ever
since
.
That
was
why
I
did
*NL*
not
mention
it
when
I
met
you
in
Christminster
,
nor
at
*NL*
the
law
proceedings
.
He
is
now
of
an
intelligent
age
,
of
*NL*
course
,
and
my
mother
and
father
have
lately
written
to
*NL*
say
that
,
as
they
have
rather
a
hard
struggle
over
there
,
*NL*
and
I
am
settled
comfortably
here
,
they
do
n't
see
why
*NL*
they
should
be
encumbered
with
the
child
any
longer
,
his
*NL*
parents
being
alive
.
I
would
have
him
with
me
here
in
*NL*
a
moment
,
but
he
is
not
old
enough
to
be
of
any
use
in
*NL*
the
bar
nor
will
be
for
years
and
years
,
and
naturally
*NL*
Cartlett
might
think
him
in
the
way
.
They
have
,
however
,
*NL*
packed
him
off
to
me
in
charge
of
some
friends
who
*NL*
happened
to
be
coming
home
,
and
I
must
ask
you
to
take
*NL*
him
when
he
arrives
,
for
I
do
n't
know
what
to
do
with
him
.
*NL*
He
is
lawfully
yours
,
that
I
solemnly
swear
.
If
anybody
*NL*
says
he
is
n't
,
call
them
brimstone
liars
,
for
my
sake
.
*NL*
Whatever
I
may
have
done
before
or
afterwards
,
I
was
*NL*
honest
to
you
from
the
time
we
were
married
till
I
went
*NL*
away
,
and
I
remain
,
yours
,
&
c.

*NL*
*NL*
ARABELLA
CARTLETT
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Sue
's
look
was
one
of
dismay
.
``
What
will
you
do
,
dear
?
''
she
asked
*NL*
faintly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
did
not
reply
,
and
Sue
watched
him
anxiously
,
with
heavy
*NL*
breaths
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
hits
me
hard
!
''
said
he
in
an
under-voice
.
``
It
MAY
be
true
!
*NL*
I
ca
n't
make
it
out
.
Certainly
,
if
his
birth
was
exactly
when
*NL*
she
says
,
he
's
mine
.
I
can
not
think
why
she
did
n't
tell
me
when
*NL*
I
met
her
at
Christminster
,
and
came
on
here
that
evening
with
*NL*
her
!
...
Ah
--
I
do
remember
now
that
she
said
something
about
having
*NL*
a
thing
on
her
mind
that
she
would
like
me
to
know
,
if
ever
we
lived
*NL*
together
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
poor
child
seems
to
be
wanted
by
nobody
!
''
Sue
replied
,
and
her
*NL*
eyes
filled
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
had
by
this
time
come
to
himself
.
``
What
a
view
of
life
he
*NL*
must
have
,
mine
or
not
mine
!
''
he
said
.
``
I
must
say
that
,
if
I
were
*NL*
better
off
,
I
should
not
stop
for
a
moment
to
think
whose
he
might
*NL*
be
.
I
would
take
him
and
bring
him
up
.
The
beggarly
question
of
*NL*
parentage
--
what
is
it
,
after
all
?
What
does
it
matter
,
when
you
come
*NL*
to
think
of
it
,
whether
a
child
is
yours
by
blood
or
not
?
All
the
*NL*
little
ones
of
our
time
are
collectively
the
children
of
us
adults
of
*NL*
the
time
,
and
entitled
to
our
general
care
.
That
excessive
regard
of
*NL*
parents
for
their
own
children
,
and
their
dislike
of
other
people
's
,
*NL*
is
,
like
class-feeling
,
patriotism
,
save-your-own-soul-ism
,
and
other
*NL*
virtues
,
a
mean
exclusiveness
at
bottom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sue
jumped
up
and
kissed
Jude
with
passionate
devotion
.
``
Yes
--
so
*NL*
it
is
,
dearest
!
And
we
'll
have
him
here
!
And
if
he
is
n't
yours
it
*NL*
makes
it
all
the
better
.
I
do
hope
he
is
n't
--
though
perhaps
I
ought
*NL*
not
to
feel
quite
that
!
If
he
is
n't
,
I
should
like
so
much
for
us
*NL*
to
have
him
as
an
adopted
child
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
must
assume
about
him
what
is
most
pleasing
to
you
,
my
*NL*
curious
little
comrade
!
''
he
said
.
``
I
feel
that
,
anyhow
,
I
do
n't
like
*NL*
to
leave
the
unfortunate
little
fellow
to
neglect
.
Just
think
of
*NL*
his
life
in
a
Lambeth
pothouse
,
and
all
its
evil
influences
,
with
a
*NL*
parent
who
does
n't
want
him
,
and
has
,
indeed
,
hardly
seen
him
,
and
*NL*
a
stepfather
who
does
n't
know
him
.
`
Let
the
day
perish
wherein
I
*NL*
was
born
,
and
the
night
in
which
it
was
said
,
There
is
a
man
child
*NL*
conceived
!
'
That
's
what
the
boy
--
MY
boy
,
perhaps
,
will
find
himself
*NL*
saying
before
long
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
I
was
the
petitioner
,
I
am
really
entitled
to
his
custody
,
I
*NL*
suppose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whether
or
no
,
we
must
have
him
.
I
see
that
.
I
'll
do
the
best
I
*NL*
can
to
be
a
mother
to
him
,
and
we
can
afford
to
keep
him
somehow
.
*NL*
I
'll
work
harder
.
I
wonder
when
he
'll
arrive
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
course
of
a
few
weeks
,
I
suppose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
--
When
shall
we
have
courage
to
marry
,
Jude
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whenever
you
have
it
,
I
think
I
shall
.
It
remains
with
you
*NL*
entirely
,
dear
.
Only
say
the
word
,
and
it
's
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Before
the
boy
comes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
make
a
more
natural
home
for
him
,
perhaps
,
''
she
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
thereupon
wrote
in
purely
formal
terms
to
request
that
the
boy
*NL*
should
be
sent
on
to
them
as
soon
as
he
arrived
,
making
no
remark
*NL*
whatever
on
the
surprising
nature
of
Arabella
's
information
,
nor
*NL*
vouchsafing
a
single
word
of
opinion
on
the
boy
's
paternity
,
nor
on
*NL*
whether
,
had
he
known
all
this
,
his
conduct
towards
her
would
have
*NL*
been
quite
the
same
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
down-train
that
was
timed
to
reach
Aldbrickham
station
about
*NL*
ten
o'clock
the
next
evening
,
a
small
,
pale
child
's
face
could
*NL*
be
seen
in
the
gloom
of
a
third-class
carriage
.
He
had
large
,
*NL*
frightened
eyes
,
and
wore
a
white
woollen
cravat
,
over
which
a
*NL*
key
was
suspended
round
his
neck
by
a
piece
of
common
string
:
the
*NL*
key
attracting
attention
by
its
occasional
shine
in
the
lamplight
.
*NL*
In
the
band
of
his
hat
his
half-ticket
was
stuck
.
His
eyes
*NL*
remained
mostly
fixed
on
the
back
of
the
seat
opposite
,
and
never
*NL*
turned
to
the
window
even
when
a
station
was
reached
and
called
.
*NL*
On
the
other
seat
were
two
or
three
passengers
,
one
of
them
a
working
*NL*
woman
who
held
a
basket
on
her
lap
,
in
which
was
a
tabby
kitten
.
*NL*
The
woman
opened
the
cover
now
and
then
,
whereupon
the
kitten
would
*NL*
put
out
its
head
,
and
indulge
in
playful
antics
.
At
these
the
*NL*
fellow-passengers
laughed
,
except
the
solitary
boy
bearing
the
key
*NL*
and
ticket
,
who
,
regarding
the
kitten
with
his
saucer
eyes
,
seemed
*NL*
mutely
to
say
:
``
All
laughing
comes
from
misapprehension
.
Rightly
*NL*
looked
at
,
there
is
no
laughable
thing
under
the
sun
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Occasionally
,
at
a
stoppage
,
the
guard
would
look
into
the
compartment
*NL*
and
say
to
the
boy
,
``
All
right
,
my
man
.
Your
box
is
safe
in
the
*NL*
van
.
''
The
boy
would
say
,
``
Yes
,
''
without
animation
,
would
try
to
*NL*
smile
,
and
fail
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
Age
masquerading
as
Juvenility
,
and
doing
it
so
badly
that
*NL*
his
real
self
showed
through
crevices
.
A
ground-swell
from
ancient
*NL*
years
of
night
seemed
now
and
then
to
lift
the
child
in
this
his
*NL*
morning-life
,
when
his
face
took
a
back
view
over
some
great
Atlantic
*NL*
of
Time
,
and
appeared
not
to
care
about
what
it
saw
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
other
travellers
closed
their
eyes
,
which
they
did
one
by
*NL*
one
--
even
the
kitten
curling
itself
up
in
the
basket
,
weary
of
its
*NL*
too
circumscribed
play
--
the
boy
remained
just
as
before
.
He
then
*NL*
seemed
to
be
doubly
awake
,
like
an
enslaved
and
dwarfed
divinity
,
*NL*
sitting
passive
and
regarding
his
companions
as
if
he
saw
their
whole
*NL*
rounded
lives
rather
than
their
immediate
figures
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
Arabella
's
boy
.
With
her
usual
carelessness
,
she
had
*NL*
postponed
writing
to
Jude
about
him
till
the
eve
of
his
landing
,
*NL*
when
she
could
absolutely
postpone
no
longer
,
though
she
had
known
*NL*
for
weeks
of
his
approaching
arrival
,
and
had
,
as
she
truly
said
,
*NL*
visited
Aldbrickham
mainly
to
reveal
the
boy
's
existence
and
his
near
*NL*
home-coming
to
Jude
.
This
very
day
on
which
she
had
received
her
*NL*
former
husband
's
answer
at
some
time
in
the
afternoon
,
the
child
*NL*
reached
the
London
Docks
,
and
the
family
in
whose
charge
he
had
come
,
*NL*
having
put
him
into
a
cab
for
Lambeth
and
directed
the
cabman
to
his
*NL*
mother
's
house
,
bade
him
good-bye
,
and
went
their
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
his
arrival
at
the
Three
Horns
,
Arabella
had
looked
him
over
with
*NL*
an
expression
that
was
as
good
as
saying
,
``
You
are
very
much
what
I
*NL*
expected
you
to
be
,
''
had
given
him
a
good
meal
,
a
little
money
,
and
,
*NL*
late
as
it
was
getting
,
dispatched
him
to
Jude
by
the
next
train
,
*NL*
wishing
her
husband
Cartlett
,
who
was
out
,
not
to
see
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
train
reached
Aldbrickham
,
and
the
boy
was
deposited
on
the
*NL*
lonely
platform
beside
his
box
.
The
collector
took
his
ticket
,
and
,
*NL*
with
a
meditative
sense
of
the
unfitness
of
things
,
asked
him
where
*NL*
he
was
going
by
himself
at
that
time
of
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Going
to
Spring
Street
,
''
said
the
little
one
impassively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
that
's
a
long
way
from
here
;
a
`
most
out
in
the
country
;
and
the
*NL*
folks
will
be
gone
to
bed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
got
to
go
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
have
a
fly
for
your
box

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
``
Oh

'd
better
leave

''
*NL*
*NL*
Saying
nothing
further
the
boy
came
out
into
the
street
,
looking
*NL*
round
to
see
that
nobody
followed
or
observed
him
.
When
he
*NL*
had
walked
some
little
distance
he
asked
for
the
street
of
his
*NL*
destination
.
He
was
told
to
go
straight
on
quite
into
the
outskirts
*NL*
of
the
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
fell
into
a
steady
mechanical
creep
which
had
in
it
an
*NL*
impersonal
quality
--
the
movement
of
the
wave
,
or
of
the
breeze
,
or
*NL*
of
the
cloud
.
He
followed
his
directions
literally
,
without
an
*NL*
inquiring
gaze
at
anything
.
It
could
have
been
seen
that
the
boy
's
*NL*
ideas
of
life
were
different
from
those
of
the
local
boys
.
Children
*NL*
begin
with
detail
,
and
learn
up
to
the
general
;
they
begin
with
the
*NL*
contiguous
,
and
gradually
comprehend
the
universal
.
The
boy
seemed
*NL*
to
have
begun
with
the
generals
of
life
,
and
never
to
have
concerned
*NL*
himself
with
the
particulars
.
To
him
the
houses
,
the
willows
,
*NL*
the
obscure
fields
beyond
,
were
apparently
regarded
not
as
brick
*NL*
residences
,
pollards
,
meadows
;
but
as
human
dwellings
in
the
*NL*
abstract
,
vegetation
,
and
the
wide
dark
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
found
the
way
to
the
little
lane
,
and
knocked
at
the
door
of
*NL*
Jude
's
house
.
Jude
had
just
retired
to
bed
,
and
Sue
was
about
to
*NL*
enter
her
chamber
adjoining
when
she
heard
the
knock
and
came
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
this
where
Father
lives
?
''
asked
the
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Fawley
,
that
's
his
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sue
ran
up
to
Jude
's
room
and
told
him
,
and
he
hurried
down
as
soon
*NL*
as
he
could
,
though
to
her
impatience
he
seemed
long
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
--
is
it
he
--
so
soon
?
''
she
asked
as
Jude
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
scrutinized
the
child
's
features
,
and
suddenly
went
away
into
the
*NL*
little
sitting-room
adjoining
.
Jude
lifted
the
boy
to
a
level
with
*NL*
himself
,
keenly
regarded
him
with
gloomy
tenderness
,
and
telling
him
*NL*
he
would
have
been
met
if
they
had
known
of
his
coming
so
soon
,
set
*NL*
him
provisionally
in
a
chair
whilst
he
went
to
look
for
Sue
,
whose
*NL*
supersensitiveness
was
disturbed
,
as
he
knew
.
He
found
her
in
the
*NL*
dark
,
bending
over
an
arm-chair
.
He
enclosed
her
with
his
arm
,
and
*NL*
putting
his
face
by
hers
,
whispered
,
``
What
's
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
Arabella
says
is
true
--
true
!
I
see
you
in
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
:
that
's
one
thing
in
my
life
as
it
should
be
,
at
any
rate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
other
half
of
him
is
--
SHE
!
And
that
's
what
I
ca
n't
bear
!
*NL*
But
I
ought
to
--
I
'll
try
to
get
used
to
it
;
yes
,
I
ought
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jealous
little
Sue
!
I
withdraw
all
remarks
about
your
sexlessness
.
*NL*
Never
mind
!
Time
may
right
things
...
And
Sue
,
darling
;
I
have
an
*NL*
idea
!
We
'll
educate
and
train
him
with
a
view
to
the
university
.
*NL*
What
I
could
n't
accomplish
in
my
own
person
perhaps
I
can
carry
out
*NL*
through
him
?
They
are
making
it
easier
for
poor
students
now
,
you
*NL*
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
you
dreamer
!
''
said
she
,
and
holding
his
hand
returned
to
the
*NL*
child
with
him
.
The
boy
looked
at
her
as
she
had
looked
at
him
.
*NL*
``
Is
it
you
who
's
my
REAL
mother
at
last
?
''
he
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
Do
I
look
like
your
father
's
wife
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
yes
;
`
cept
he
seems
fond
of
you
,
and
you
of
him
.
Can
I
call
*NL*
you
Mother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
a
yearning
look
came
over
the
child
and
he
began
to
cry
.
Sue
*NL*
thereupon
could
not
refrain
from
instantly
doing
likewise
,
being
a
*NL*
harp
which
the
least
wind
of
emotion
from
another
's
heart
could
make
*NL*
to
vibrate
as
readily
as
a
radical
stir
in
her
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
call
me
Mother
,
if
you
wish
to
,
my
poor
dear
!
''
she
said
,
*NL*
bending
her
cheek
against
his
to
hide
her
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
this
round
your
neck
?
''
asked
Jude
with
affected
calmness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
key
of
my
box
that
's
at
the
station
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
bustled
about
and
got
him
some
supper
,
and
made
him
up
a
*NL*
temporary
bed
,
where
he
soon
fell
asleep
.
Both
went
and
looked
at
*NL*
him
as
he
lay
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
called
you
Mother
two
or
three
times
before
he
dropped
off
,
''
*NL*
murmured
Jude
.
``
Was
n't
it
odd
that
he
should
have
wanted
to
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
it
was
significant
,
''
said
Sue
.
``
There
's
more
for
us
to
think
*NL*
about
in
that
one
little
hungry
heart
than
in
all
the
stars
of
the
*NL*
sky
...
I
suppose
,
dear
,
we
must
pluck
up
courage
,
and
get
that
*NL*
ceremony
over
?
It
is
no
use
struggling
against
the
current
,
and
I
*NL*
feel
myself
getting
intertwined
with
my
kind
.
Oh
Jude
,
you
'll
love
*NL*
me
dearly
,
wo
n't
you
,
afterwards
?
I
do
want
to
be
kind
to
this
*NL*
child
,
and
to
be
a
mother
to
him
;
and
our
adding
the
legal
form
to
*NL*
our
marriage
might
make
it
easier

me

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Their
next
and
second
attempt
thereat
was
more
deliberately
made
,
*NL*
though
it
was
begun
on
the
morning
following
the
singular
child
's
*NL*
arrival
at
their
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Him
they
found
to
be
in
the
habit
of
sitting
silent
,
his
quaint
and
*NL*
weird
face
set
,
and
his
eyes
resting
on
things
they
did
not
see
in
*NL*
the
substantial
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
face
is
like
the
tragic
mask
of
Melpomene

said
Sue
.
``
What
is
*NL*
your

Did
you
tell

*NL*
*NL*
``
Little

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
talk
so

too

said
Sue
tenderly
.
``
It
is
strange
,
Jude

*NL*
that
these
preternaturally
old
boys
almost
always
come

But
what
were

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never

*NL*

``
Why

*NL*
``
Because

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

your
name
is
not
Jude

then

said
his
father
with
some
*NL*
disappointment
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
shook
his
head
.
``
Never
heerd
on
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
not

said
Sue
quickly
;
``
since
she
was
hating
you
all
the
*NL*
time

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
have
him
christened

''
said
Jude
;
and
privately
to
Sue
:
``
The
*NL*
day
we
are
married
.
''
Yet
the
advent
of
the
child
disturbed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
position
lent
them
shyness
,
and
having
an
impression
that
a
*NL*
marriage
at
a
superintendent
registrar
's
office
was
more
private
than
*NL*
an
ecclesiastical
one
,
they
decided
to
avoid
a
church
this
time
.
*NL*
Both
Sue
and
Jude
together
went
to
the
office
of
the
district
to
give
*NL*
notice
:
they
had
become
such
companions
that
they
could
hardly
do
*NL*
anything
of
importance
except
in
each
other
's
company
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
Fawley
signed
the
form
of
notice
,
Sue
looking
over
his
shoulder
*NL*
and
watching
his
hand
as
it
traced
the
words
.
As
she
read
the
*NL*
four-square
undertaking
,
never
before
seen
by
her
,
into
which
*NL*
her
own
and
Jude
's
names
were
inserted
,
and
by
which
that
very
*NL*
volatile
essence
,
their
love
for
each
other
,
was
supposed
to
be
*NL*
made
permanent
,
her
face
seemed
to
grow
painfully
apprehensive
.
*NL*
``
Names

-LRB-

were
to

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
spoils
the

does
n't
it

''
she
said
on
their
way
home
.
*NL*
``
It
seems
making
a
more
sordid

is
a
little
poetry
in

*NL*

We

So
said
the
Jewish
*NL*
law-giver
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
you

*NL*
*NL*
During
the
interval
before
the
issuing
of
the
certificate
,
Sue
,
in
her
*NL*
housekeeping
errands
,
sometimes
walked
past
the
office
,
and
furtively
*NL*
glancing
in
saw
affixed
to
the
wall
the
notice
of
the
purposed
clinch
*NL*
to
their
union
.
She
could
not
bear
its
aspect
.
Coming
after
her
*NL*
previous
experience
of
matrimony
,
all
the
romance
of
their
attachment
*NL*
seemed
to
be
starved
away
by
placing
her
present
case
in
the
same
*NL*
category
.
She
was
usually
leading
little
Father
Time
by
the
hand
,
*NL*
and
fancied
that
people
thought
him
hers
,
and
regarded
the
intended
*NL*
ceremony
as
the
patching
up
of
an
old
error
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
Jude
decided
to
link
his
present
with
his
past
in
some
*NL*
slight
degree
by
inviting
to
the
wedding
the
only
person
remaining
on
*NL*
earth
who
was
associated
with
his
early
life
at
Marygreen
--
the
aged
*NL*
widow
Mrs.
Edlin
,
who
had
been
his
great-aunt
's
friend
and
nurse
in
*NL*
her
last
illness
.
He
hardly
expected
that
she
would
come
;
but
she
*NL*
did
,
bringing
singular
presents
,
in
the
form
of
apples
,
jam
,
brass
*NL*
snuffers
,
an
ancient
pewter
dish
,
a
warming-pan
,
and
an
enormous
bag
*NL*
of
goose
feathers
towards
a
bed
.
She
was
allotted
the
spare
room
in
*NL*
Jude
's
house
,
whither
she
retired
early
,
and
where
they
could
hear
*NL*
her
through
the
ceiling
below
,
honestly
saying
the
Lord
's
Prayer
in
*NL*
a
loud
voice
,
as
the
Rubric
directed
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
,
however
,
she
could
not
sleep
,
and
discovered
that
Sue
and
Jude
*NL*
were
still
sitting
up
--
it
being
in
fact
only
ten
o'clock
--
she
dressed
*NL*
herself
again
and
came
down
,
and
they
all
sat
by
the
fire
till
a
late
*NL*
hour
--
Father
Time
included
;
though
,
as
he
never
spoke
,
they
were
*NL*
hardly
conscious
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
bai
n't
set
against
marrying
as
your
great-aunt
was
,
''
said
*NL*
the
widow
.
``
And
I
hope

be
a
jocund
wedding

hope
it
more

more

I

unlucky

*NL*
Sue
breathed
uneasily

*NL*
*NL*
``

continued
the
wedding
guest

``
But
things
happened

to
thwart

``
I

have

well

heard
of
this
.
What
--
did
this
man
--
my
ancestor
*NL*
and
Sue
's
--
kill
his
wife
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Twer
not
that
exactly
.
She
ran
away
from
him
,
with
their
child
,
*NL*
to
her
friends
;
and
while
she
was
there
the
child
died
.
He
wanted
*NL*
the
body
,
to
bury
it
where
his
people
lay
,
but
she
would
n't
give
it
*NL*
up
.
Her
husband
then
came
in
the
night
with
a
cart
,
and
broke
into
*NL*
the
house
to
steal
the
coffin
away
;
but
he
was
catched
,
and
being
*NL*
obstinate
,
would
n't
tell
what
he
broke
in
for
.
They
brought
it
in
*NL*
burglary
,
and
that
's
why
he
was
hanged
and
gibbeted
on
Brown
House
*NL*
Hill
.
His
wife
went
mad
after
he
was
dead
.
But
it
med
n't
be
true
*NL*
that
he
belonged
to
ye
more
than
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
small
slow
voice
rose
from
the
shade
of
the
fireside
,
as
if
out
of
*NL*
the
earth
:
``
If
I
was
you
,
Mother
,
I
would
n't
marry
Father
!
''
It
came
*NL*
from
little
Time
,
and
they
started
,
for
they
had
forgotten
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
is
only
a
tale
,
''
said
Sue
cheeringly
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
exhilarating
tradition
from
the
widow
on
the
eve
of
*NL*
the
solemnization
they
rose
,
and
,
wishing
their
guest
good-night
,
*NL*
retired
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
Sue
,
whose
nervousness
intensified
with
the
*NL*
hours
,
took
Jude
privately
into
the
sitting-room
before
starting
.
*NL*
``
Jude
,
I
want
you
to
kiss
me
,
as
a
lover
,
incorporeally
,
''
she
said
,
*NL*
tremulously
nestling
up
to
him
,
with
damp
lashes
.
``
It
wo
n't
be
ever
*NL*
like
this
any
more
,
will
it
?
I
wish
we
had
n't
begun
the
business
.
*NL*
But
I
suppose
we
must
go
on
.
How
horrid
that
story
was
last
night
!
*NL*
It
spoilt
my
thoughts
of
to-day
.
It
makes
me
feel
as
if
a
tragic
doom
*NL*
overhung
our
family
,
as
it
did
the
house
of
Atreus
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
the
house
of
Jeroboam
,
''
said
the
quondam
theologian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
And
it
seems
awful
temerity
in
us
two
to
go
marrying
!
I
am
*NL*
going
to
vow
to
you
in
the
same
words
I
vowed
in
to
my
other
husband
,
*NL*
and
you
to
me
in
the
same
as
you
used
to
your
other
wife
;
regardless
*NL*
of
the
deterrent
lesson
we
were
taught
by
those
experiments
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
are
uneasy
I
am
made
unhappy
,
''
said
he
.
``
I
had
hoped
you
*NL*
would
feel
quite
joyful
.
But
if
you
do
n't
,
you
do
n't
.
It
is
no
use
*NL*
pretending
.
It
is
a
dismal
business
to
you
,
and
that
makes
it
so
to
*NL*
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
unpleasantly
like
that
other
morning
--
that
's
all
,
''
she
*NL*
murmured
.
``
Let
us
go
on
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
started
arm
in
arm
for
the
office
aforesaid
,
no
witness
*NL*
accompanying
them
except
the
Widow
Edlin
.
The
day
was
chilly
and
*NL*
dull
,
and
a
clammy
fog
blew
through
the
town
from
``
Royal-tower
'd
*NL*
Thame
.
''
On
the
steps
of
the
office
there
were
the
muddy
foot-marks
*NL*
of
people
who
had
entered
,
and
in
the
entry
were
damp
umbrellas
.
*NL*
Within
the
office
several
persons
were
gathered
,
and
our
couple
*NL*
perceived
that
a
marriage
between
a
soldier
and
a
young
woman
was
*NL*
just
in
progress
.
Sue
,
Jude
,
and
the
widow
stood
in
the
background
*NL*
while
this
was
going
on
,
Sue
reading
the
notices
of
marriage
on
the
*NL*
wall
.
The
room
was
a
dreary
place
to
two
of
their
temperament
,
*NL*
though
to
its
usual
frequenters
it
doubtless
seemed
ordinary
enough
.
*NL*
Law-books
in
musty
calf
covered
one
wall
,
and
elsewhere
were
*NL*
post-office
directories
,
and
other
books
of
reference
.
Papers
in
*NL*
packets
tied
with
red
tape
were
pigeon-holed
around
,
and
some
iron
*NL*
safes
filled
a
recess
,
while
the
bare
wood
floor
was
,
like
the
*NL*
door-step
,
stained
by
previous
visitors
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
soldier
was
sullen
and
reluctant
:
the
bride
sad
and
timid
;
she
*NL*
was
soon
,
obviously
,
to
become
a
mother
,
and
she
had
a
black
eye
.
*NL*
Their
little
business
was
soon
done
,
and
the
twain
and
their
friends
*NL*
straggled
out
,
one
of
the
witnesses
saying
casually
to
Jude
and
Sue
*NL*
in
passing
,
as
if
he
had
known
them
before
:
``
See
the
couple
just
*NL*
come
in
?
Ha
,
ha
!
That
fellow
is
just
out
of
gaol
this
morning
.
*NL*
She
met
him
at
the
gaol
gates
,
and
brought
him
straight
here
.
She
's
*NL*
paying
for
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sue
turned
her
head
and
saw
an
ill-favoured
man
,
closely
cropped
,
*NL*
with
a
broad-faced
,
pock-marked
woman
on
his
arm
,
ruddy
with
liquor
*NL*
and
the
satisfaction
of
being
on
the
brink
of
a
gratified
desire
.
*NL*
They
jocosely
saluted
the
outgoing
couple
,
and
went
forward
in
front
*NL*
of
Jude
and
Sue
,
whose
diffidence
was
increasing
.
The
latter
drew
*NL*
back
and
turned
to
her
lover
,
her
mouth
shaping
itself
like
that
of
*NL*
a
child
about
to
give
way
to
grief
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jude
--
I
do
n't
like
it
here
!
I
wish
we
had
n't
come
!
The
place
gives
*NL*
me
the
horrors
:
it
seems
so
unnatural
as
the
climax
of
our
love
!
*NL*
I
wish
it
had
been
at
church
,
if
it
had
to
be
at
all
.
It
is
not
so
*NL*
vulgar
there
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
little
girl
,
''
said
Jude
.
``
How
troubled
and
pale
you
look
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
must
be
performed
here
now
,
I
suppose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
perhaps
not
necessarily
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
spoke
to
the
clerk
,
and
came
back
.
``
No
--
we
need
not
marry
here
or
*NL*
anywhere
,
unless
we
like
,
even
now
,
''
he
said
.
``
We
can
be
married
in
*NL*
a
church
,
if
not
with
the
same
certificate
with
another
he
'll
give
*NL*
us
,
I
think
.
Anyhow
,
let
us
go
out
till
you
are
calmer
,
dear
,
and
I
*NL*
too
,
and
talk
it
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
out
stealthily
and
guiltily
,
as
if
they
had
committed
a
*NL*
misdemeanour
,
closing
the
door
without
noise
,
and
telling
the
widow
,
*NL*
who
had
remained
in
the
entry
,
to
go
home
and
await
them
;
that
they
*NL*
would
call
in
any
casual
passers
as
witnesses
,
if
necessary
.
When
*NL*
in
the
street
they
turned
into
an
unfrequented
side
alley
where
they
*NL*
walked
up
and
down
as
they
had
done
long
ago
in
the
market-house
at
*NL*
Melchester
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
darling
,
what
shall
we
do
?
We
are
making
a
mess
of
it
,
it
*NL*
strikes
me
.
Still
,
ANYTHING
that
pleases
you
will
please
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
Jude
,
dearest
,
I
am
worrying
you
!
You
wanted
it
to
be
there
,
*NL*
did
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
when
I
got
inside
I
felt
as
if
I
did
n't
*NL*
care
much
about
it
.
The
place
depressed
me
almost
as
much
as
it
*NL*
did
you
--
it
was
ugly
.
And
then
I
thought
of
what
you
had
said
this
*NL*
morning
as
to
whether
we
ought
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
walked
on
vaguely
,
till
she
paused
,
and
her
little
voice
began
*NL*
anew
:
``
It
seems
so
weak
,
too
,
to
vacillate
like
this
!
And
yet
how
*NL*
much
better
than
to
act
rashly
a
second
time
...
How
terrible
that
*NL*
scene
was
to
me
!
The
expression
in
that
flabby
woman
's
face
,
leading
*NL*
her
on
to
give
herself
to
that
gaol-bird
,
not
for
a
few
hours
,
as
she
*NL*
would
,
but
for
a
lifetime
,
as
she
must
.
And
the
other
poor
soul
--
to
*NL*
escape
a
nominal
shame
which
was
owing
to
the
weakness
of
her
*NL*
character
,
degrading
herself
to
the
real
shame
of
bondage
to
a
tyrant
*NL*
who
scorned
her
--
a
man
whom
to
avoid
for
ever
was
her
only
chance
of
*NL*
salvation
...
This
is
our
parish
church
,
is
n't
it
?
This
is
where
*NL*
it
would
have
to
be
,
if
we
did
it
in
the
usual
way
?
A
service
or
*NL*
something
seems
to
be
going
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
went
up
and
looked
in
at
the
door
.
``
Why
--
it
is
a
wedding
here
*NL*
too
,
''
he
said
.
``
Everybody
seems
to
be
on
our
tack
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sue
said
she
supposed
it
was
because
Lent
was
just
over
,
when
there
*NL*
was
always
a
crowd
of
marriages
.
``
Let
us
listen
,
''
she
said
,
``
and
*NL*
find
how
it
feels
to
us
when
performed
in
a
church
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
stepped
in
,
and
entered
a
back
seat
,
and
watched
the
proceedings
*NL*
at
the
altar
.
The
contracting
couple
appeared
to
belong
to
the
*NL*
well-to-do
middle
class
,
and
the
wedding
altogether
was
of
ordinary
*NL*
prettiness
and
interest
.
They
could
see
the
flowers
tremble
in
the
*NL*
bride
's
hand
,
even
at
that
distance
,
and
could
hear
her
mechanical
*NL*
murmur
of
words
whose
meaning
her
brain
seemed
to
gather
not
at
all
*NL*
under
the
pressure
of
her
self-consciousness
.
Sue
and
Jude
listened
,
*NL*
and
severally
saw
themselves
in
time
past
going
through
the
same
form
*NL*
of
self-committal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
the
same
to
her
,
poor
thing
,
as
it
would
be
to
me
doing
it
*NL*
over
again
with
my
present
knowledge
,
''
Sue
whispered
.
``
You
see
,
they
*NL*
are
fresh
to
it
,
and
take
the
proceedings
as
a
matter
of
course
.
*NL*
But
having
been
awakened
to
its
awful
solemnity
as
we
have
,
or
at
*NL*
least
as
I
have
,
by
experience
,
and
to
my
own
too
squeamish
feelings
*NL*
perhaps
sometimes
,
it
really
does
seem
immoral
in
me
to
go
and
*NL*
undertake
the
same
thing
again
with
open
eyes
.
Coming
in
here
and
*NL*
seeing
this
has
frightened
me
from
a
church
wedding
as
much
as
the
*NL*
other
did
from
a
registry
one
...
We
are
a
weak
,
tremulous
pair
,
*NL*
Jude
,
and
what
others
may
feel
confident
in
I
feel
doubts
of
--
my
*NL*
being
proof
against
the
sordid
conditions
of
a
business
contract
*NL*
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
they
tried
to
laugh
,
and
went
on
debating
in
whispers
the
*NL*
object-lesson
before
them
.
And
Jude
said
he
also
thought
they
were
*NL*
both
too
thin-skinned
--
that
they
ought
never
to
have
been
born
--
much
*NL*
less
have
come
together
for
the
most
preposterous
of
all
joint
*NL*
ventures
for
THEM
--
matrimony
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
betrothed
shuddered
;
and
asked
him
earnestly
if
he
indeed
*NL*
felt
that
they
ought
not
to
go
in
cold
blood
and
sign
that
*NL*
life-undertaking
again
?
``
It
is
awful
if
you
think
we
have
found
*NL*
ourselves
not
strong
enough
for
it
,
and
knowing
this
,
are
proposing
*NL*
to
perjure
ourselves
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
fancy
I
do
think
it
--
since
you
ask
me
,
''
said
Jude
.
``
Remember
I
'll
*NL*
do
it
if
you
wish
,
own
darling
.
''
While
she
hesitated
he
went
on
to
*NL*
confess
that
,
though
he
thought
they
ought
to
be
able
to
do
it
,
he
*NL*
felt
checked
by
the
dread
of
incompetency
just
as
she
did
--
from
their
*NL*
peculiarities
,
perhaps
,
because
they
were
unlike
other
people
.
``
We
*NL*
are
horribly
sensitive
;
that
's
really
what
's
the
matter
with
us
,
*NL*
Sue
!
''
he
declared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
fancy
more
are
like
us
than
we
think
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
do
n't
know
.
The
intention
of
the
contract
is
good
,
and
*NL*
right
for
many
,
no
doubt
;
but
in
our
case
it
may
defeat
its
own
ends
*NL*
because
we
are
the
queer
sort
of
people
we
are
--
folk
in
whom
domestic
*NL*
ties
of
a
forced
kind
snuff
out
cordiality
and
spontaneousness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sue
still
held
that
there
was
not
much
queer
or
exceptional
in
them
:
*NL*
that
all
were
so
.
``
Everybody
is
getting
to
feel
as
we
do
.
We
are
*NL*
a
little
beforehand
,
that
's
all
.
In
fifty
,
a
hundred
,
years
the
*NL*
descendants
of
these
two
will
act
and
feel
worse
than
we
.
They
*NL*
will
see
weltering
humanity
still
more
vividly
than
we
do
now
,
as
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Shapes
like
our
own
selves
hideously
multiplied
,
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
and
will
be
afraid
to
reproduce
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
terrible
line
of
poetry
!
...
though
I
have
felt
it
myself
*NL*
about
my
fellow-creatures
,
at
morbid
times
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
they
murmured
on
,
till
Sue
said
more
brightly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
the
general
question
is
not
our
business
,
and
why
should
we
*NL*
plague
ourselves
about
it
?
However
different
our
reasons
are
,
we
come
*NL*
to
the
same
conclusion
:
that
for
us
particular
two
,
an
irrevocable
*NL*
oath
is
risky
.
Then
,
Jude
,
let
us
go
home
without
killing
our
dream
!
*NL*
Yes
?
How
good
you
are
,
my
friend
:
you
give
way
to
all
my
whims
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
accord
very
much
with
my
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
gave
her
a
little
kiss
behind
a
pillar
while
the
attention
of
*NL*
everybody
present
was
taken
up
in
observing
the
bridal
procession
*NL*
entering
the
vestry
;
and
then
they
came
outside
the
building
.
By
the
*NL*
door
they
waited
till
two
or
three
carriages
,
which
had
gone
away
for
*NL*
a
while
,
returned
,
and
the
new
husband
and
wife
came
into
the
open
*NL*
daylight
.
Sue
sighed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
flowers
in
the
bride
's
hand
are
sadly
like
the
garland
which
*NL*
decked
the
heifers
of
sacrifice
in
old
times
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
,
Sue
,
it
is
no
worse
for
the
woman
than
for
the
man
.
That
's
*NL*
what
some
women
fail
to
see
,
and
instead
of
protesting
against
the
*NL*
conditions
they
protest
against
the
man
,
the
other
victim
;
just
as
a
*NL*
woman
in
a
crowd
will
abuse
the
man
who
crushes
against
her
,
when
he
*NL*
is
only
the
helpless
transmitter
of
the
pressure
put
upon
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
some
are
like
that
,
instead
of
uniting
with
the
man
against
*NL*
the
common
enemy
,
coercion
.
''
The
bride
and
bridegroom
had
by
this
*NL*
time
driven
off
,
and
the
two
moved
away
with
the
rest
of
the
idlers
.
*NL*
``
No
--
do
n't
let
's
do
it
,
''
she
continued
.
``
At
least
,
just
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
reached
home
,
and
passing
the
window
arm
in
arm
saw
the
widow
*NL*
looking
out
at
them
.
``
Well
,
''
cried
their
guest
when
they
entered
,
``
I
*NL*
said
to
myself
when
I
zeed
ye
coming
so
loving
up
to
the
door
,
`
They
*NL*
made
up
their
minds
at
last
,
then
!
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
briefly
hinted
that
they
had
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
--
and
ha
'n'
t
ye
really
done
it
?
Chok
'
it
all
,
that
I
should
*NL*
have
lived
to
see
a
good
old
saying
like
`
marry
in
haste
and
repent
*NL*
at
leisure
'
spoiled
like
this
by
you
two
!
'T
is
time
I
got
back
again
*NL*
to
Marygreen
--
sakes
if
tidden
--
if
this
is
what
the
new
notions
be
*NL*
leading
us
to
!
Nobody
thought
o
'
being
afeard
o
'
matrimony
in
my
*NL*
time
,
nor
of
much
else
but
a
cannon-ball
or
empty
cupboard
!
Why
when
*NL*
I
and
my
poor
man
were
married
we
thought
no
more
o
'
t
than
of
a
game
*NL*
o
'
dibs
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
tell
the
child
when
he
comes
in
,
''
whispered
Sue
nervously
.
*NL*
``
He
'll
think
it
has
all
gone
on
right
,
and
it
will
be
better
that
he
*NL*
should
not
be
surprised
and
puzzled
.
Of
course
it
is
only
put
off
*NL*
for
reconsideration
.
If
we
are
happy
as
we
are
,
what
does
it
matter
*NL*
to
anybody
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
V
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
purpose
of
a
chronicler
of
moods
and
deeds
does
not
require
him
*NL*
to
express
his
personal
views
upon
the
grave
controversy
above
given
.
*NL*
That
the
twain
were
happy
--
between
their
times
of
sadness
--
was
*NL*
indubitable
.
And
when
the
unexpected
apparition
of
Jude
's
child
*NL*
in
the
house
had
shown
itself
to
be
no
such
disturbing
event
as
it
*NL*
had
looked
,
but
one
that
brought
into
their
lives
a
new
and
tender
*NL*
interest
of
an
ennobling
and
unselfish
kind
,
it
rather
helped
than
*NL*
injured
their
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
be
sure
,
with
such
pleasing
anxious
beings
as
they
were
,
the
boy
's
*NL*
coming
also
brought
with
it
much
thought
for
the
future
,
particularly
*NL*
as
he
seemed
at
present
to
be
singularly
deficient
in
all
the
usual
*NL*
hopes
of
childhood
.
But
the
pair
tried
to
dismiss
,
for
a
while
at
*NL*
least
,
a
too
strenuously
forward
view
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
in
Upper
Wessex
an
old
town
of
nine
or
ten
thousand
souls
;
*NL*
the
town
may
be
called
Stoke-Barehills
.
It
stands
with
its
gaunt
,
*NL*
unattractive
,
ancient
church
,
and
its
new
red
brick
suburb
,
amid
*NL*
the
open
,
chalk-soiled
cornlands
,
near
the
middle
of
an
imaginary
*NL*
triangle
which
has
for
its
three
corners
the
towns
of
Aldbrickham
*NL*
and
Wintoncester
,
and
the
important
military
station
of
Quartershot
.
*NL*
The
great
western
highway
from
London
passes
through
it
,
near
a
point
*NL*
where
the
road
branches
into
two
,
merely
to
unite
again
some
twenty
*NL*
miles
further
westward
.
Out
of
this
bifurcation
and
reunion
there
*NL*
used
to
arise
among
wheeled
travellers
,
before
railway
days
,
endless
*NL*
questions
of
choice
between
the
respective
ways
.
But
the
question
*NL*
is
now
as
dead
as
the
scot-and-lot
freeholder
,
the
road
waggoner
,
*NL*
and
the
mail
coachman
who
disputed
it
;
and
probably
not
a
single
*NL*
inhabitant
of
Stoke-Barehills
is
now
even
aware
that
the
two
roads
*NL*
which
part
in
his
town
ever
meet
again
;
for
nobody
now
drives
up
and
*NL*
down
the
great
western
highway
dally
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
most
familiar
object
in
Stoke-Barehills
nowadays
is
its
cemetery
,
*NL*
standing
among
some
picturesque
mediaeval
ruins
beside
the
railway
;
*NL*
the
modern
chapels
,
modern
tombs
,
and
modern
shrubs
having
a
look
of
*NL*
intrusiveness
amid
the
crumbling
and
ivy-covered
decay
of
the
ancient
*NL*
walls
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
a
certain
day
,
however
,
in
the
particular
year
which
has
now
been
*NL*
reached
by
this
narrative
--
the
month
being
early
June
--
the
features
*NL*
of
the
town
excite
little
interest
,
though
many
visitors
arrive
by
*NL*
the
trains
;
some
down-trains
,
in
especial
,
nearly
emptying
themselves
*NL*
here
.
It
is
the
week
of
the
Great
Wessex
Agricultural
Show
,
whose
*NL*
vast
encampment
spreads
over
the
open
outskirts
of
the
town
like
*NL*
the
tents
of
an
investing
army
.
Rows
of
marquees
,
huts
,
booths
,
*NL*
pavilions
,
arcades
,
porticoes
--
every
kind
of
structure
short
of
*NL*
a
permanent
one
--
cover
the
green
field
for
the
space
of
a
square
*NL*
half-mile
,
and
the
crowds
of
arrivals
walk
through
the
town
in
*NL*
a
mass
,
and
make
straight
for
the
exhibition
ground
.
The
way
*NL*
thereto
is
lined
with
shows
,
stalls
,
and
hawkers
on
foot
,
who
make
*NL*
a
market-place
of
the
whole
roadway
to
the
show
proper
,
and
lead
*NL*
some
of
the
improvident
to
lighten
their
pockets
appreciably
before
*NL*
they
reach
the
gates
of
the
exhibition
they
came
expressly
to
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
the
popular
day
,
the
shilling
day
,
and
of
the
fast
arriving
*NL*
excursion
trains
two
from
different
directions
enter
the
two
*NL*
contiguous
railway
stations
at
almost
the
same
minute
.
One
,
like
*NL*
several
which
have
preceded
it
,
comes
from
London
:
the
other
by
a
*NL*
cross-line
from
Aldbrickham
;
and
from
the
London
train
alights
a
*NL*
couple
;
a
short
,
rather
bloated
man
,
with
a
globular
stomach
and
*NL*
small
legs
,
resembling
a
top
on
two
pegs
,
accompanied
by
a
woman
of
*NL*
rather
fine
figure
and
rather
red
face
,
dressed
in
black
material
,
*NL*
and
covered
with
beads
from
bonnet
to
skirt
,
that
made
her
glisten
*NL*
as
if
clad
in
chain-mail
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
cast
their
eyes
around
.
The
man
was
about
to
hire
a
fly
as
some
*NL*
others
had
done
,
when
the
woman
said
,
``
Do
n't
be
in
such
a
hurry
,
*NL*
Cartlett
.
It
is
n't
so
very
far
to
the
show-yard
.
Let
us
walk
down
*NL*
the
street
into
the
place
.
Perhaps
I
can
pick
up
a
cheap
bit
of
*NL*
furniture
or
old
china
.
It
is
years
since
I
was
here
--
never
since
*NL*
I
lived
as
a
girl
at
Aldbrickham
,
and
used
to
come
across
for
a
trip
*NL*
sometimes
with
my
young
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
carry
home
furniture
by
excursion
train
,
''
said
,
in
a
thick
*NL*
voice
,
her
husband
,
the
landlord
of
The
Three
Horns
,
Lambeth
;
for
*NL*
they
had
both
come
down
from
the
tavern
in
that
``
excellent
,
densely
*NL*
populated
,
gin-drinking
neighbourhood
,
''
which
they
had
occupied
ever
*NL*
since
the
advertisement
in
those
words
had
attracted
them
thither
.
*NL*
The
configuration
of
the
landlord
showed
that
he
,
too
,
like
his
*NL*
customers
,
was
becoming
affected
by
the
liquors
he
retailed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
'll
get
it
sent
,
if
I
see
any
worth
having
,
''
said
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
sauntered
on
,
but
had
barely
entered
the
town
when
her
attention
*NL*
was
attracted
by
a
young
couple
leading
a
child
,
who
had
come
out
*NL*
from
the
second
platform
,
into
which
the
train
from
Aldbrickham
had
*NL*
steamed
.
They
were
walking
just
in
front
of
the
inn-keepers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sakes
alive
!
''
said
Arabella
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
that
?
''
said
Cartlett
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
do
you
think
that
couple
is
?
Do
n't
you
recognize
the
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
from
the
photos
I
have
showed
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
Fawley
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
of
course
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
.
I
suppose
he
was
inclined
for
a
little
sight-seeing
like
*NL*
the
rest
of
us
.
''
Cartlett
's
interest
in
Jude
whatever
it
might
have
*NL*
been
when
Arabella
was
new
to
him
,
had
plainly
flagged
since
her
*NL*
charms
and
her
idiosyncrasies
,
her
supernumerary
hair-coils
,
and
her
*NL*
optional
dimples
,
were
becoming
as
a
tale
that
is
told
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arabella
so
regulated
her
pace
and
her
husband
's
as
to
keep
just
in
*NL*
the
rear
of
the
other
three
,
which
it
was
easy
to
do
without
notice
*NL*
in
such
a
stream
of
pedestrians
.
Her
answers
to
Cartlett
's
remarks
*NL*
were
vague
and
slight
,
for
the
group
in
front
interested
her
more
*NL*
than
all
the
rest
of
the
spectacle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
rather
fond
of
one
another
and
of
their
child
,
seemingly
,
''
*NL*
continued
the
publican
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
THEIR
child
!
'T
is
n't
their
child
,
''
said
Arabella
with
a
curious
,
*NL*
sudden
covetousness
.
``
They
have
n't
been
married
long
enough
for
it
*NL*
to
be
theirs
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
although
the
smouldering
maternal
instinct
was
strong
enough
*NL*
in
her
to
lead
her
to
quash
her
husband
's
conjecture
,
she
was
not
*NL*
disposed
on
second
thoughts
to
be
more
candid
than
necessary
.
Mr.
*NL*
Cartlett
had
no
other
idea
than
that
his
wife
's
child
by
her
first
*NL*
husband
was
with
his
grandparents
at
the
Antipodes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
I
suppose
not
.
She
looks
quite
a
girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
only
lovers
,
or
lately
married
,
and
have
the
child
in
*NL*
charge
,
as
anybody
can
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
continued
to
move
ahead
.
The
unwitting
Sue
and
Jude
,
the
couple
*NL*
in
question
,
had
determined
to
make
this
agricultural
exhibition
*NL*
within
twenty
miles
of
their
own
town
the
occasion
of
a
day
's
*NL*
excursion
which
should
combine
exercise
and
amusement
with
*NL*
instruction
,
at
small
expense
.
Not
regardful
of
themselves
alone
,
*NL*
they
had
taken
care
to
bring
Father
Time
,
to
try
every
means
of
*NL*
making
him
kindle
and
laugh
like
other
boys
,
though
he
was
to
*NL*
some
extent
a
hindrance
to
the
delightfully
unreserved
intercourse
*NL*
in
their
pilgrimages
which
they
so
much
enjoyed
.
But
they
soon
*NL*
ceased
to
consider
him
an
observer
,
and
went
along
with
that
tender
*NL*
attention
to
each
other
which
the
shyest
can
scarcely
disguise
,
and
*NL*
which
these
,
among
entire
strangers
as
they
imagined
,
took
less
*NL*
trouble
to
disguise
than
they
might
have
done
at
home
.
Sue
,
in
her
*NL*
new
summer
clothes
,
flexible
and
light
as
a
bird
,
her
little
thumb
*NL*
stuck
up
by
the
stem
of
her
white
cotton
sunshade
,
went
along
as
if
*NL*
she
hardly
touched
ground
,
and
as
if
a
moderately
strong
puff
of
wind
*NL*
would
float
her
over
the
hedge
into
the
next
field
.
Jude
,
in
his
*NL*
light
grey
holiday-suit
,
was
really
proud
of
her
companionship
,
not
*NL*
more
for
her
external
attractiveness
than
for
her
sympathetic
words
*NL*
and
ways
.
That
complete
mutual
understanding
,
in
which
every
glance
*NL*
and
movement
was
as
effectual
as
speech
for
conveying
intelligence
*NL*
between
them
,
made
them
almost
the
two
parts
of
a
single
whole
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
pair
with
their
charge
passed
through
the
turnstiles
,
Arabella
*NL*
and
her
husband
not
far
behind
them
.
When
inside
the
enclosure
the
*NL*
publican
's
wife
could
see
that
the
two
ahead
began
to
take
trouble
*NL*
with
the
youngster
,
pointing
out
and
explaining
the
many
objects
of
*NL*
interest
,
alive
and
dead
;
and
a
passing
sadness
would
touch
their
*NL*
faces
at
their
every
failure
to
disturb
his
indifference
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
she
sticks
to
him
!
''
said
Arabella
.
``
Oh
no
--
I
fancy
they
are
not
*NL*
married
,
or
they
would
n't
be
so
much
to
one
another
as
that
...
I
*NL*
wonder
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
thought
you
said
he
did
marry
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
heard
he
was
going
to
--
that
's
all
,
going
to
make
another
attempt
,
*NL*
after
putting
it
off
once
or
twice
...
As
far
as
they
themselves
are
*NL*
concerned
they
are
the
only
two
in
the
show
.
I
should
be
ashamed
of
*NL*
making
myself
so
silly
if
I
were
he
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
see
as
how
there
's
anything
remarkable
in
their
behaviour
.
*NL*
I
should
never
have
noticed
their
being
in
love
,
if
you
had
n't
said
*NL*
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
never
see
anything
,
''
she
rejoined
.
Nevertheless
Cartlett
's
view
*NL*
of
the
lovers
'
or
married
pair
's
conduct
was
undoubtedly
that
of
the
*NL*
general
crowd
,
whose
attention
seemed
to
be
in
no
way
attracted
by
*NL*
what
Arabella
's
sharpened
vision
discerned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
charmed
by
her
as
if
she
were
some
fairy
!
''
continued
Arabella
.
*NL*
``
See
how
he
looks
round
at
her
,
and
lets
his
eyes
rest
on
her
.
I
am
*NL*
inclined
to
think
that
she
do
n't
care
for
him
quite
so
much
as
he
*NL*
does
for
her
.
She
's
not
a
particular
warm-hearted
creature
to
my
*NL*
thinking
,
though
she
cares
for
him
pretty
middling
much
--
as
much
as
*NL*
she
's
able
to
;
and
he
could
make
her
heart
ache
a
bit
if
he
liked
to
*NL*
try
--
which
he
's
too
simple
to
do
.
There
--
now
they
are
going
across
*NL*
to
the
cart-horse
sheds
.
Come
along
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
to
see
the
cart-horses
.
It
is
no
business
of
ours
to
*NL*
follow
these
two
.
If
we
have
come
to
see
the
show
let
us
see
it
in
*NL*
our
own
way
,
as
they
do
in
theirs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
suppose
we
agree
to
meet
somewhere
in
an
hour
's
time
--
say
at
*NL*
that
refreshment
tent
over
there
,
and
go
about
independent
?
Then
you
*NL*
can
look
at
what
you
choose
to
,
and
so
can
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cartlett
was
not
loath
to
agree
to
this
,
and
they
parted
--
he
*NL*
proceeding
to
the
shed
where
malting
processes
were
being
exhibited
,
*NL*
and
Arabella
in
the
direction
taken
by
Jude
and
Sue
.
Before
,
*NL*
however
,
she
had
regained
their
wake
a
laughing
face
met
her
own
,
*NL*
and
she
was
confronted
by
Anny
,
the
friend
of
her
girlhood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anny
had
burst
out
in
hearty
laughter
at
the
mere
fact
of
the
chance
*NL*
encounter
.
``
I
am
still
living
down
there
,
''
she
said
,
as
soon
as
*NL*
she
was
composed
.
``
I
am
soon
going
to
be
married
,
but
my
intended
*NL*
could
n't
come
up
here
to-day

But
there
's
lots
of
us
come
by
*NL*
excursion
,
though
I
've
lost
the
rest
of
'em
for
the
present

*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
met
Jude

his

Anny
laughed

Ah

Suppose

go
that
way

Why

Wessex

I
verily
believe

There
's
Dr.

years

he

not

looking
a
day
older

when
I
used
to
know
him

How
do
you
do
,
*NL*
Physician
?
I
was
just
saying
that
you
do

look
a
day
older

you
knew
me
as
a
girl

*NL*
*NL*
``
Simply
the

Only
two

warranted
efficacious

Now
let

Only
two-and-three

*NL*
*NL*
The
physician
had
produced
a
box
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
,
and
*NL*
Arabella
was
induced
to
make
the
purchase
.
*NL*
*NL*

continued
he
,
when

were

I
taught
him
the
dead
languages

And
believe
me

he
soon

knew
nearly
as
much
as
I.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
lost
him
;
but
not
as
you

said
Arabella
dryly
.
``
The
*NL*

untied
us

There

is

that
young

*NL*
*NL*
``
Cousinship
is
a
great
convenience
to
their
feelings

I
should
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

So
her
husband
thought
,
no
doubt
,
when
he
divorced
*NL*
her
...
Shall
we
look
at
the
pictures
,
too
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
trio
followed
across
the
green
and
entered
.
Jude
and
Sue
,
with
*NL*
the
child
,
unaware
of
the
interest
they
were
exciting
,
had
gone
*NL*
up
to
a
model
at
one
end
of
the
building
,
which
they
regarded
*NL*
with
considerable
attention
for
a
long
while
before
they
went
*NL*
on
.
Arabella
and
her
friends
came
to
it
in
due
course
,
and
the
*NL*
inscription
it
bore
was
:
``
Model
of
Cardinal
College
,
Christminster
;
*NL*
by
J.
Fawley
and
S.
F.
M.
Bridehead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Admiring
their
own
work
,
''
said
Arabella
.
``
How
like
Jude
--
always
*NL*
thinking
of
colleges
and
Christminster
,
instead
of
attending
to
his
*NL*
business
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
glanced
cursorily
at
the
pictures
,
and
proceeded
to
the
*NL*
band-stand
.
When
they
had
stood
a
little
while
listening
to
the
*NL*
music
of
the
military
performers
,
Jude
,
Sue
,
and
the
child
came
up
on
*NL*
the
other
side
.
Arabella
did
not
care
if
they
should
recognize
her
;
*NL*
but
they
were
too
deeply
absorbed
in
their
own
lives
,
as
translated
*NL*
into
emotion
by
the
military
band
,
to
perceive
her
under
her
beaded
*NL*
veil
.
She
walked
round
the
outside
of
the
listening
throng
,
passing
*NL*
behind
the
lovers
,
whose
movements
had
an
unexpected
fascination
for
*NL*
her
to-day
.
Scrutinizing
them
narrowly
from
the
rear
she
noticed
*NL*
that
Jude
's
hand
sought
Sue
's
as
they
stood
,
the
two
standing
close
*NL*
together
so
as
to
conceal
,
as
they
supposed
,
this
tacit
expression
*NL*
of
their
mutual
responsiveness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Silly
fools
--
like
two
children
!
''
Arabella
whispered
to
herself
*NL*
morosely
,
as
she
rejoined
her
companions
,
with
whom
she
preserved
a
*NL*
preoccupied
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anny
meanwhile
had
jokingly
remarked
to
Vilbert
on
Arabella
's
*NL*
hankering
interest
in
her
first
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
the
physician
to
Arabella
,
apart
;
``
do
you
want
anything
*NL*
such
as
this
,
Mrs.
Cartlett
?
It
is
not
compounded
out
of
my
regular
*NL*
pharmacopoeia
,
but
I
am
sometimes
asked
for
such
a
thing
.
''
He
*NL*
produced
a
small
phial
of
clear
liquid
.
``
A
love-philtre
,
such
as
was
*NL*
used
by
the
ancients
with
great
effect
.
I
found
it
out
by
study
of
*NL*
their
writings
,
and
have
never
known
it
to
fail
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
made
of
?
''
asked
Arabella
curiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
a
distillation
of
the
juices
of
doves
'
hearts
--
otherwise
*NL*
pigeons
'
--
is
one
of
the
ingredients
.
It
took
nearly
a
hundred
hearts
*NL*
to
produce
that
small
bottle
full
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
get
pigeons
enough
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
tell
a
secret
,
I
get
a
piece
of
rock-salt
,
of
which
pigeons
are
*NL*
inordinately
fond
,
and
place
it
in
a
dovecot
on
my
roof
.
In
a
few
*NL*
hours
the
birds
come
to
it
from
all
points
of
the
compass
--
east
,
*NL*
west
,
north
,
and
south
--
and
thus
I
secure
as
many
as
I
require
.
*NL*
You
use
the
liquid
by
contriving
that
the
desired
man
shall
take
*NL*
about
ten
drops
of
it
in
his
drink
.
But
remember
,
all
this
is
told
*NL*
you
because
I
gather
from
your
questions
that
you
mean
to
be
a
*NL*
purchaser
.
You
must
keep
faith
with
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
--
I
do
n't
mind
a
bottle
--
to
give
some
friend
or
other
to
*NL*
try
it
on
her
young
man
.
''
She
produced
five
shillings
,
the
price
*NL*
asked
,
and
slipped
the
phial
in
her
capacious
bosom
.
Saying
*NL*
presently
that
she
was
due
at
an
appointment
with
her
husband
,
she
*NL*
sauntered
away
towards
the
refreshment
bar
,
Jude
,
his
companion
,
and
*NL*
the
child
having
gone
on
to
the
horticultural
tent
,
where
Arabella
*NL*
caught
a
glimpse
of
them
standing
before
a
group
of
roses
in
bloom
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
waited
a
few
minutes
observing
them
,
and
then
proceeded
to
join
*NL*
her
spouse
with
no
very
amiable
sentiments
.
She
found
him
seated
on
*NL*
a
stool
by
the
bar
,
talking
to
one
of
the
gaily
dressed
maids
who
had
*NL*
served
him
with
spirits
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
you
had
enough
of
this
business
at
home
!
''
Arabella
*NL*
remarked
gloomily
.
``
Surely
you
did
n't
come
fifty
miles
from
your
own
*NL*
bar
to
stick
in
another
?
Come
,
take
me
round
the
show
,
as
other
men
*NL*
do
their
wives
!
Dammy
,
one
would
think
you
were
a
young
bachelor
,
*NL*
with
nobody
to
look
after
but
yourself
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
we
agreed
to
meet
here
;
and
what
could
I
do
but
wait
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
now
we
have
met
,
come
along
,
''
she
returned
,
ready
to
quarrel
*NL*
with
the
sun
for
shining
on
her
.
And
they
left
the
tent
together
,
*NL*
this
pot-bellied
man
and
florid
woman
,
in
the
antipathetic
,
*NL*
recriminatory
mood
of
the
average
husband
and
wife
of
Christendom
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
the
more
exceptional
couple
and
the
boy
still
*NL*
lingered
in
the
pavilion
of
flowers
--
an
enchanted
palace
to
their
*NL*
appreciative
taste
--
Sue
's
usually
pale
cheeks
reflecting
the
pink
of
*NL*
the
tinted
roses
at
which
she
gazed
;
for
the
gay
sights
,
the
air
,
the
*NL*
music
,
and
the
excitement
of
a
day
's
outing
with
Jude
had
quickened
*NL*
her
blood
and
made
her
eyes
sparkle
with
vivacity
.
She
adored
roses
,
*NL*
and
what
Arabella
had
witnessed
was
Sue
detaining
Jude
almost
against
*NL*
his
will
while
she
learnt
the
names
of
this
variety
and
that
,
and
put
*NL*
her
face
within
an
inch
of
their
blooms
to
smell
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
to
push
my
face
quite
into
them
--
the
dears
!
''
she
had
*NL*
said
.
``
But
I
suppose
it
is
against
the
rules
to
touch
them
--
is
n't
*NL*
it
,
Jude
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
baby
,
''
said
he
:
and
then
playfully
gave
her
a
little
push
,
*NL*
so
that
her
nose
went
among
the
petals
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
policeman
will
be
down
on
us
,
and
I
shall
say
it
was
my
*NL*
husband
's
fault
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
looked
up
at
him
,
and
smiled
in
a
way
that
told
so
much
to
*NL*
Arabella
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Happy
?
''
he
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
nodded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
Because
you
have
come
to
the
great
Wessex
Agricultural
*NL*
Show
--
or
because
WE
have
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
always
trying
to
make
me
confess
to
all
sorts
of
*NL*
absurdities

Because
I
am
improving
my
mind
,
of
course
,
by
seeing
*NL*
all
these
steam-ploughs
,
and
threshing-machines
,
and
chaff-cutters
,
*NL*
and
cows
,
and
pigs
,
and
sheep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
was
quite
content
with
a
baffle
from
his
ever
evasive
companion
.
*NL*
But
when
he
had
forgotten
that
he
had
put
the
question
,
and
because
*NL*
he
no
longer
wished
for
an
answer
,
she
went
on
:
``
I
feel
that
we
have
*NL*
returned
to
Greek
joyousness
,
and
have
blinded
ourselves
to
sickness
*NL*
and
sorrow
,
and
have
forgotten
what
twenty-five
centuries
have
taught
*NL*
the
race
since
their
time
,
as
one
of
your
Christminster
luminaries
*NL*
says
...
There
is
one
immediate
shadow
,
however
--
only
one
.
''
And
*NL*
she
looked
at
the
aged
child
,
whom
,
though
they
had
taken
him
to
*NL*
everything
likely
to
attract
a
young
intelligence
,
they
had
utterly
*NL*
failed
to
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
knew
what
they
were
saying
and
thinking
.
``
I
am
very
,
very
sorry
,
*NL*
Father
and
Mother
,
''
he
said
.
``
But
please
do
n't
mind
!
--
I
ca
n't
help
*NL*
it
.
I
should
like
the
flowers
very
very
much
,
if
I
did
n't
keep
on
*NL*
thinking
they
'd
be
all
withered
in
a
few
days
!

VI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
unnoticed
lives
that
the
pair
had
hitherto
led
began
,
from
the
*NL*
day
of
the
suspended
wedding
onwards
,
to
be
observed
and
discussed
by
*NL*
other
persons
than
Arabella
.
The
society
of
Spring
Street
and
the
*NL*
neighbourhood
generally
did
not
understand
,
and
probably
could
not
*NL*
have
been
made
to
understand
,
Sue
and
Jude
's
private
minds
,
emotions
,
*NL*
positions
,
and
fears
.
The
curious
facts
of
a
child
coming
to
them
*NL*
unexpectedly
,
who
called
Jude
``
Father
,
''
and
Sue
``
Mother
,
''
and
a
hitch
*NL*
in
a
marriage
ceremony
intended
for
quietness
to
be
performed
at
a
*NL*
registrar
's
office
,
together
with
rumours
of
the
undefended
cases
in
*NL*
the
law-courts
,
bore
only
one
translation
to
plain
minds
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Time
--
for
though
he
was
formally
turned
into
``
Jude
,
''
the
apt
*NL*
nickname
stuck
to
him
--
would
come
home
from
school
in
the
evening
,
*NL*
and
repeat
inquiries
and
remarks
that
had
been
made
to
him
by
the
*NL*
other
boys
;
and
cause
Sue
,
and
Jude
when
he
heard
them
,
a
great
deal
*NL*
of
pain
and
sadness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
result
was
that
shortly
after
the
attempt
at
the
registrar
's
the
*NL*
pair
went
off
--
to
London
it
was
believed
--
for
several
days
,
hiring
*NL*
somebody
to
look
to
the
boy
.
When
they
came
back
they
let
it
be
*NL*
understood
indirectly
,
and
with
total
indifference
and
weariness
*NL*
of
mien
,
that
they
were
legally
married
at
last
.
Sue
,
who
had
*NL*
previously
been
called
Mrs.
Bridehead
now
openly
adopted
the
name
of
*NL*
Mrs.
Fawley
.
Her
dull
,
cowed
,
and
listless
manner
for
days
seemed
*NL*
to
substantiate
all
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
mistake
-LRB-
as
it
was
called
-RRB-
of
their
going
away
so
secretly
*NL*
to
do
the
business
,
kept
up
much
of
the
mystery
of
their
lives
;
and
*NL*
they
found
that
they
made
not
such
advances
with
their
neighbours
as
*NL*
they
had
expected
to
do
thereby
.
A
living
mystery
was
not
much
less
*NL*
interesting
than
a
dead
scandal
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
baker
's
lad
and
the
grocer
's
boy
,
who
at
first
had
used
to
lift
*NL*
their
hats
gallantly
to
Sue
when
they
came
to
execute
their
errands
,
*NL*
in
these
days
no
longer
took
the
trouble
to
render
her
that
homage
,
*NL*
and
the
neighbouring
artizans
'
wives
looked
straight
along
the
*NL*
pavement
when
they
encountered
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nobody
molested
them
,
it
is
true
;
but
an
oppressive
atmosphere
began
*NL*
to
encircle
their
souls
,
particularly
after
their
excursion
to
the
*NL*
show
,
as
if
that
visit
had
brought
some
evil
influence
to
bear
on
*NL*
them
.
And
their
temperaments
were
precisely
of
a
kind
to
suffer
from
*NL*
this
atmosphere
,
and
to
be
indisposed
to
lighten
it
by
vigorous
and
*NL*
open
statements
.
Their
apparent
attempt
at
reparation
had
come
too
*NL*
late
to
be
effective
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
headstone
and
epitaph
orders
fell
off
:
and
two
or
three
months
*NL*
later
,
when
autumn
came
,
Jude
perceived
that
he
would
have
to
return
*NL*
to
journey-work
again
,
a
course
all
the
more
unfortunate
just
now
,
*NL*
in
that
he
had
not
as
yet
cleared
off
the
debt
he
had
unavoidably
*NL*
incurred
in
the
payment
of
the
law-costs
of
the
previous
year
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
he
sat
down
to
share
the
common
meal
with
Sue
and
the
*NL*
child
as
usual
.
``
I
am
thinking
,
''
he
said
to
her
,
``
that
I
'll
hold
on
*NL*
here
no
longer
.
The
life
suits
us
,
certainly
;
but
if
we
could
get
*NL*
away
to
a
place
where
we
are
unknown
,
we
should
be
lighter
hearted
,
*NL*
and
have
a
better
chance
.
And
so
I
am
afraid
we
must
break
it
up
*NL*
here
,
however
awkward
for
you
,
poor
dear
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sue
was
always
much
affected
at
a
picture
of
herself
as
an
object
of
*NL*
pity
,
and
she
saddened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
I
am
not
sorry
,
''
said
she
presently
.
``
I
am
much
depressed
*NL*
by
the
way
they
look
at
me
here
.
And
you
have
been
keeping
on
this
*NL*
house
and
furniture
entirely
for
me
and
the
boy
!
You
do
n't
want
*NL*
it
yourself
,
and
the
expense
is
unnecessary
.
But
whatever
we
do
,
*NL*
wherever
we
go
,
you
wo
n't
take
him
away
from
me
,
Jude
dear
?
I
could
*NL*
not
let
him
go
now
!
The
cloud
upon
his
young
mind
makes
him
so
*NL*
pathetic
to
me
;
I
do
hope
to
lift
it
some
day
!
And
he
loves
me
so
.
*NL*
You
wo
n't
take
him
away
from
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
I
wo
n't
,
dear
little
girl
!
We
'll
get
nice
lodgings
,
*NL*
wherever
we
go
.
I
shall
be
moving
about
probably
--
getting
a
job
*NL*
here
and
a
job
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
do
something
too
,
of
course
,
till
--
till
--
Well
,
now
I
ca
n't
*NL*
be
useful
in
the
lettering
it
behoves
me
to
turn
my
hand
to
something
*NL*
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
hurry
about
getting
employment
,
''
he
said
regretfully
.
``
I
*NL*
do
n't
want
you
to
do
that
.
I
wish
you
would
n't
,
Sue
.
The
boy
and
*NL*
yourself
are
enough
for
you
to
attend
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
knock
at
the
door
,
and
Jude
answered
it
.
Sue
could
hear
*NL*
the
conversation
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Mr.
Fawley
at
home
?
...
Biles
and
Willis
,
the
building
*NL*
contractors
,
sent
me
to
know
if
you
'll
undertake
the
relettering
*NL*
of
the
ten
commandments
in
a
little
church
they
've
been
restoring
*NL*
lately
in
the
country
near
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
reflected
,
and
said
he
could
undertake
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
a
very
artistic
job
,
''
continued
the
messenger
.
``
The
*NL*
clergyman
is
a
very
old-fashioned
chap
,
and
he
has
refused
to
let
*NL*
anything
more
be
done
to
the
church
than
cleaning
and
repairing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excellent
old
man
!
''
said
Sue
to
herself
,
who
was
sentimentally
*NL*
opposed
to
the
horrors
of
over-restoration
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Ten
Commandments
are
fixed
to
the
east
end
,
''
the
messenger
went
*NL*
on
,
``
and
they
want
doing
up
with
the
rest
of
the
wall
there
,
since
*NL*
he
wo
n't
have
them
carted
off
as
old
materials
belonging
to
the
*NL*
contractor
in
the
usual
way
of
the
trade
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
bargain
as
to
terms
was
struck
,
and
Jude
came
indoors
.
``
There
,
you
*NL*
see
,
''
he
said
cheerfully
.
``
One
more
job
yet
,
at
any
rate
,
and
you
*NL*
can
help
in
it
--
at
least
you
can
try
.
We
shall
have
all
the
church
*NL*
to
ourselves
,
as
the
rest
of
the
work
is
finished
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
Jude
went
out
to
the
church
,
which
was
only
two
miles
*NL*
off
.
He
found
that
what
the
contractor
's
clerk
had
said
was
true
.
*NL*
The
tables
of
the
Jewish
law
towered
sternly
over
the
utensils
of
*NL*
Christian
grace
,
as
the
chief
ornament
of
the
chancel
end
,
in
the
*NL*
fine
dry
style
of
the
last
century
.
And
as
their
framework
was
*NL*
constructed
of
ornamental
plaster
they
could
not
be
taken
down
for
*NL*
repair
.
A
portion
,
crumbled
by
damp
,
required
renewal
;
and
when
*NL*
this
had
been
done
,
and
the
whole
cleansed
,
he
began
to
renew
the
*NL*
lettering
.
On
the
second
morning
Sue
came
to
see
what
assistance
*NL*
she
could
render
,
and
also
because
they
liked
to
be
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
silence
and
emptiness
of
the
building
gave
her
confidence
,
and
,
*NL*
standing
on
a
safe
low
platform
erected
by
Jude
,
which
she
was
*NL*
nevertheless
timid
at
mounting
,
she
began
painting
in
the
letters
*NL*
of
the
first
Table
while
he
set
about
mending
a
portion
of
the
*NL*
second
.
She
was
quite
pleased
at
her
powers
;
she
had
acquired
them
*NL*
in
the
days
she
painted
illumined
texts
for
the
church-fitting
shop
*NL*
at
Christminster
.
Nobody
seemed
likely
to
disturb
them
;
and
the
*NL*
pleasant
twitter
of
birds
,
and
rustle
of
October
leafage
,
came
in
*NL*
through
an
open
window
,
and
mingled
with
their
talk
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
not
,
however
,
to
be
left
thus
snug
and
peaceful
for
long
.
*NL*
About
half-past
twelve
there
came
footsteps
on
the
gravel
without
.
*NL*
The
old
vicar
and
his
churchwarden
entered
,
and
,
coming
up
to
see
*NL*
what
was
being
done
,
seemed
surprised
to
discover
that
a
young
woman
*NL*
was
assisting
.
They
passed
on
into
an
aisle
,
at
which
time
the
door
*NL*
again
opened
,
and
another
figure
entered
--
a
small
one
,
that
of
little
*NL*
Time
,
who
was
crying
.
Sue
had
told
him
where
he
might
find
her
*NL*
between
school-hours
,
if
he
wished
.
She
came
down
from
her
perch
,
*NL*
and
said
,
``
What
's
the
matter
,
my
dear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
n't
stay
to
eat
my
dinner
in
school
,
because
they
said
--
''
*NL*
He
described
how
some
boys
had
taunted
him
about
his
nominal
mother
,
*NL*
and
Sue
,
grieved
,
expressed
her
indignation
to
Jude
aloft
.
The
child
*NL*
went
into
the
churchyard
,
and
Sue
returned
to
her
work
.
Meanwhile
*NL*
the
door
had
opened
again
,
and
there
shuffled
in
with
a
businesslike
*NL*
air
the
white-aproned
woman
who
cleaned
the
church
.
Sue
recognized
*NL*
her
as
one
who
had
friends
in
Spring
Street
,
whom
she
visited
.
The
*NL*
church-cleaner
looked
at
Sue
,
gaped
,
and
lifted
her
hands
;
she
had
*NL*
evidently
recognized
Jude
's
companion
as
the
latter
had
recognized
*NL*
her
.
Next
came
two
ladies
,
and
after
talking
to
the
charwoman
they
*NL*
also
moved
forward
,
and
as
Sue
stood
reaching
upward
,
watched
her
*NL*
hand
tracing
the
letters
,
and
critically
regarded
her
person
in
*NL*
relief
against
the
white
wall
,
till
she
grew
so
nervous
that
she
*NL*
trembled
visibly
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
back
to
where
the
others
were
standing
,
talking
in
*NL*
undertones
:
and
one
said
--
Sue
could
not
hear
which
--
``
She
's
his
wife
,
*NL*
I
suppose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
say
Yes
:
some
say
No
,
''
was
the
reply
from
the
charwoman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
?
Then
she
ought
to
be
,
or
somebody
's
--
that
's
very
clear
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
've
only
been
married
a
very
few
weeks
,
whether
or
no
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
strange
pair
to
be
painting
the
Two
Tables
!
I
wonder
Biles
and
*NL*
Willis
could
think
of
such
a
thing
as
hiring
those
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
churchwarden
supposed
that
Biles
and
Willis
knew
of
nothing
*NL*
wrong
,
and
then
the
other
,
who
had
been
talking
to
the
old
woman
,
*NL*
explained
what
she
meant
by
calling
them
strange
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
probable
drift
of
the
subdued
conversation
which
followed
was
*NL*
made
plain
by
the
churchwarden
breaking
into
an
anecdote
,
in
a
voice
*NL*
that
everybody
in
the
church
could
hear
,
though
obviously
suggested
*NL*
by
the
present
situation
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
now
,
it
is
a
curious
thing
,
but
my
grandfather
told
me
a
*NL*
strange
tale
of
a
most
immoral
case
that
happened
at
the
painting
of
*NL*
the
Commandments
in
a
church
out
by
Gaymead
--
which
is
quite
within
a
*NL*
walk
of
this
one
.
In
them
days
Commandments
were
mostly
done
in
gilt
*NL*
letters
on
a
black
ground
,
and
that
's
how
they
were
out
where
I
say
,
*NL*
before
the
owld
church
was
rebuilded
.
It
must
have
been
somewhere
*NL*
about
a
hundred
years
ago
that
them
Commandments
wanted
doing
up
just
*NL*
as
ours
do
here
,
and
they
had
to
get
men
from
Aldbrickham
to
do
'em
.
*NL*
Now
they
wished
to
get
the
job
finished
by
a
particular
Sunday
,
so
*NL*
the
men
had
to
work
late
Saturday
night
,
against
their
will
,
for
*NL*
overtime
was
not
paid
then
as
't
is
now
.
There
was
no
true
religion
*NL*
in
the
country
at
that
date
,
neither
among
pa
`
sons
,
clerks
,
nor
*NL*
people
,
and
to
keep
the
men
up
to
their
work
the
vicar
had
to
let
'em
*NL*
have
plenty
of
drink
during
the
afternoon
.
As
evening
drawed
on
they
*NL*
sent
for
some
more
themselves
;
rum
,
by
all
account
.
It
got
later
and
*NL*
later
,
and
they
got
more
and
more
fuddled
,
till
at
last
they
went
*NL*
a-putting
their
rum-bottle
and
rummers
upon
the
communion
table
,
and
*NL*
drawed
up
a
trestle
or
two
,
and
sate
round
comfortable
and
poured
*NL*
out
again
right
hearty
bumpers
.
No
sooner
had
they
tossed
off
their
*NL*
glasses
than
,
so
the
story
goes
,
they
fell
down
senseless
,
one
and
*NL*
all
.
How
long
they
bode
so
they
did
n't
know
,
but
when
they
came
*NL*
to
themselves
there
was
a
terrible
thunder-storm
a-raging
,
and
*NL*
they
seemed
to
see
in
the
gloom
a
dark
figure
with
very
thin
legs
*NL*
and
a
curious
voot
,
a-standing
on
the
ladder
,
and
finishing
their
*NL*
work
.
When
it
got
daylight
they
could
see
that
the
work
was
really
*NL*
finished
,
and
could
n't
at
all
mind
finishing
it
themselves
.
They
*NL*
went
home
,
and
the
next
thing
they
heard
was
that
a
great
scandal
had
*NL*
been
caused
in
the
church
that
Sunday
morning
,
for
when
the
people
*NL*
came
and
service
began
,
all
saw
that
the
Ten
Commandments
wez
painted
*NL*
with
the
`
nots
'
left
out
.
Decent
people
would
n't
attend
service
*NL*
there
for
a
long
time
,
and
the
Bishop
had
to
be
sent
for
to
*NL*
reconsecrate
the
church
.
That
's
the
tradition
as
I
used
to
hear
it
*NL*
as
a
child
.
You
must
take
it
for
what
it
is
wo
`
th
,
but
this
case
*NL*
to-day
has
reminded
me
o
`
t
,
as
I
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
visitors
gave
one
more
glance
,
as
if
to
see
whether
Jude
and
*NL*
Sue
had
left
the
``
nots
''
out
likewise
,
and
then
severally
left
the
*NL*
church
,
even
the
old
woman
at
last
.
Sue
and
Jude
,
who
had
not
*NL*
stopped
working
,
sent
back
the
child
to
school
,
and
remained
without
*NL*
speaking
;
till
,
looking
at
her
narrowly
,
he
found
she
had
been
crying
*NL*
silently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
,
comrade
!
''
he
said
.
``
I
know
what
it
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
BEAR
that
they
,
and
everybody
,
should
think
people
wicked
*NL*
because
they
may
have
chosen
to
live
their
own
way
!
It
is
really
*NL*
these
opinions
that
make
the
best
intentioned
people
reckless
,
and
*NL*
actually
become
immoral
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
be
cast
down
!
It
was
only
a
funny
story
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
but
we
suggested
it
!
I
am
afraid
I
have
done
you
mischief
,
*NL*
Jude
,
instead
of
helping
you
by
coming
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
have
suggested
such
a
story
was
certainly
not
very
exhilarating
,
*NL*
in
a
serious
view
of
their
position
.
However
,
in
a
few
minutes
Sue
*NL*
seemed
to
see
that
their
position
this
morning
had
a
ludicrous
side
,
*NL*
and
wiping
her
eyes
she
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
droll
,
after
all
,
''
she
said
,
``
that
we
two
,
of
all
people
,
*NL*
with
our
queer
history
,
should
happen
to
be
here
painting
the
*NL*
Ten
Commandments
!
You
a
reprobate
,
and
I
--
in
my
condition
...
O
*NL*
dear
!
''
...
And
with
her
hand
over
her
eyes
she
laughed
again
*NL*
silently
and
intermittently
,
till
she
was
quite
weak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
better
,
''
said
Jude
gaily
.
``
Now
we
are
right
again
,
are
n't
*NL*
we
,
little
girl
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
but
it
is
serious
,
all
the
same
!
''
she
sighed
as
she
took
up
the
*NL*
brush
and
righted
herself
.
``
But
do
you
see
they
do
n't
think
we
are
*NL*
married
?
They
WO
N'T
believe
it
!
It
is
extraordinary
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
care
whether
they
think
so
or
not
,
''
said
Jude
.
``
I
sha
n't
*NL*
take
any
more
trouble
to
make
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
sat
down
to
lunch
--
which
they
had
brought
with
them
not
to
*NL*
hinder
time
--
and
having
eaten
it
,
were
about
to
set
to
work
anew
when
*NL*
a
man
entered
the
church
,
and
Jude
recognized
in
him
the
contractor
*NL*
Willis
.
He
beckoned
to
Jude
,
and
spoke
to
him
apart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
--
I
've
just
had
a
complaint
about
this
,
''
he
said
,
with
rather
*NL*
breathless
awkwardness
.
``
I
do
n't
wish
to
go
into
the
matter
--
as
of
*NL*
course
I
did
n't
know
what
was
going
on
--
but
I
am
afraid
I
must
ask
*NL*
you
and
her
to
leave
off
,
and
let
somebody
else
finish
this
!
It
is
*NL*
best
,
to
avoid
all
unpleasantness
.
I
'll
pay
you
for
the
week
,
all
*NL*
the
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
was
too
independent
to
make
any
fuss
;
and
the
contractor
paid
*NL*
him
,
and
left
.
Jude
picked
up
his
tools
,
and
Sue
cleansed
her
brush
.
*NL*
Then
their
eyes
met
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
could
we
be
so
simple
as
to
suppose
we
might
do
this
!
''
said
*NL*
she
,
dropping
to
her
tragic
note
.
``
Of
course
we
ought
not
--
I
ought
*NL*
not
--
to
have
come
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
no
idea
that
anybody
was
going
to
intrude
into
such
a
lonely
*NL*
place
and
see
us
!
''
Jude
returned
.
``
Well
,
it
ca
n't
be
helped
,
dear
;
*NL*
and
of
course
I
would
n't
wish
to
injure
Willis
's
trade-connection
by
*NL*
staying
.
''
They
sat
down
passively
for
a
few
minutes
,
proceeded
out
*NL*
of
the
church
,
and
overtaking
the
boy
pursued
their
thoughtful
way
*NL*
to
Aldbrickham
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fawley
had
still
a
pretty
zeal
in
the
cause
of
education
,
and
,
as
was
*NL*
natural
with
his
experiences
,
he
was
active
in
furthering
``
equality
*NL*
of
opportunity
''
by
any
humble
means
open
to
him
.
He
had
joined
an
*NL*
Artizans
'
Mutual
Improvement
Society
established
in
the
town
about
*NL*
the
time
of
his
arrival
there
;
its
members
being
young
men
of
all
*NL*
creeds
and
denominations
,
including
Churchmen
,
Congregationalists
,
*NL*
Baptists
,
Unitarians
,
Positivists
,
and
others
--
Agnostics
had
scarcely
*NL*
been
heard
of
at
this
time
--
their
one
common
wish
to
enlarge
their
*NL*
minds
forming
a
sufficiently
close
bond
of
union
.
The
subscription
*NL*
was
small
,
and
the
room
homely
;
and
Jude
's
activity
,
uncustomary
*NL*
acquirements
,
and
,
above
all
,
singular
intuition
on
what
to
read
*NL*
and
how
to
set
about
it
--
begotten
of
his
years
of
struggle
against
*NL*
malignant
stars
--
had
led
to
his
being
placed
on
the
committee
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
evenings
after
his
dismissal
from
the
church
repairs
,
and
*NL*
before
he
had
obtained
any
more
work
to
do
,
he
went
to
attend
a
*NL*
meeting
of
the
aforesaid
committee
.
It
was
late
when
he
arrived
:
all
*NL*
the
others
had
come
,
and
as
he
entered
they
looked
dubiously
at
him
,
*NL*
and
hardly
uttered
a
word
of
greeting
.
He
guessed
that
something
*NL*
bearing
on
himself
had
been
either
discussed
or
mooted
.
Some
*NL*
ordinary
business
was
transacted
,
and
it
was
disclosed
that
the
*NL*
number
of
subscriptions
had
shown
a
sudden
falling
off
for
that
*NL*
quarter
.
One
member
--
a
really
well-meaning
and
upright
man
--
began
*NL*
speaking
in
enigmas
about
certain
possible
causes
:
that
it
behoved
*NL*
them
to
look
well
into
their
constitution
;
for
if
the
committee
were
*NL*
not
respected
,
and
had
not
at
least
,
in
their
differences
,
a
common
*NL*
standard
of
CONDUCT
,
they
would
bring
the
institution
to
the
ground
.
*NL*
Nothing
further
was
said
in
Jude
's
presence
,
but
he
knew
what
this
*NL*
meant
;
and
turning
to
the
table
wrote
a
note
resigning
his
office
*NL*
there
and
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
the
supersensitive
couple
were
more
and
more
impelled
to
go
*NL*
away
.
And
then
bills
were
sent
in
,
and
the
question
arose
,
what
*NL*
could
Jude
do
with
his
great-aunt
's
heavy
old
furniture
,
if
he
left
*NL*
the
town
to
travel
he
knew
not
whither
?
This
,
and
the
necessity
of
*NL*
ready
money
,
compelled
him
to
decide
on
an
auction
,
much
as
he
would
*NL*
have
preferred
to
keep
the
venerable
goods
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
of
the
sale
came
on
;
and
Sue
for
the
last
time
cooked
her
*NL*
own
,
the
child
's
,
and
Jude
's
breakfast
in
the
little
house
he
had
*NL*
furnished
.
It
chanced
to
be
a
wet
day
;
moreover
Sue
was
unwell
,
and
*NL*
not
wishing
to
desert
her
poor
Jude
in
such
gloomy
circumstances
,
*NL*
for
he
was
compelled
to
stay
awhile
,
she
acted
on
the
suggestion
of
*NL*
the
auctioneer
's
man
,
and
ensconced
herself
in
an
upper
room
,
which
*NL*
could
be
emptied
of
its
effects
,
and
so
kept
closed
to
the
bidders
.
*NL*
Here
Jude
discovered
her
;
and
with
the
child
,
and
their
few
trunks
,
*NL*
baskets
,
and
bundles
,
and
two
chairs
and
a
table
that
were
not
in
*NL*
the
sale
,
the
two
sat
in
meditative
talk
.
*NL*
*NL*
Footsteps
began
stamping
up
and
down
the
bare
stairs
,
the
comers
*NL*
inspecting
the
goods
,
some
of
which
were
of
so
quaint
and
ancient
a
*NL*
make
as
to
acquire
an
adventitious
value
as
art
.
Their
door
was
*NL*
tried
once
or
twice
,
and
to
guard
themselves
against
intrusion
Jude
*NL*
wrote
``
Private
''
on
a
scrap
of
paper
,
and
stuck
it
upon
the
panel
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
soon
found
that
,
instead
of
the
furniture
,
their
own
personal
*NL*
histories
and
past
conduct
began
to
be
discussed
to
an
unexpected
*NL*
and
intolerable
extent
by
the
intending
bidders
.
It
was
not
till
*NL*
now
that
they
really
discovered
what
a
fools
'
paradise
of
supposed
*NL*
unrecognition
they
had
been
living
in
of
late
.
Sue
silently
took
*NL*
her
companion
's
hand
,
and
with
eyes
on
each
other
they
heard
these
*NL*
passing
remarks
--
the
quaint
and
mysterious
personality
of
Father
*NL*
Time
being
a
subject
which
formed
a
large
ingredient
in
the
hints
and
*NL*
innuendoes
.
At
length
the
auction
began
in
the
room
below
,
whence
*NL*
they
could
hear
each
familiar
article
knocked
down
,
the
highly
prized
*NL*
ones
cheaply
,
the
unconsidered
at
an
unexpected
price
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
People
do
n't
understand
us
,
''
he
sighed
heavily
.
``
I
am
glad
we
have
*NL*
decided
to
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
question
is
,
where
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
ought
to
be
to
London

There
one
can
live
as
one
chooses

*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
not
London

dear

it
well

We
should
be
unhappy
there

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ca
n't
you
think
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
Arabella
is
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
chief
reason
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
in
the
country
I
shall
always
be
uneasy
lest
there
should
be
*NL*
some
more
of
our
late
experience

And
I
do
n't
care
to
lessen
it
by
*NL*
explaining
,
for
one
thing
,
all
about
the
boy
's
history

To
cut
him
*NL*
off
from
his
past
I
have
determined
to
keep
silence
.
I
am
sickened
*NL*
of
ecclesiastical
work
now
;
and
I
should
n't
like
to
accept
it

offered
me

*NL*
``
You
ought

Christminster
Cathedral

almost
the
first
place
in
which
we
looked

in

Under

uncouth

dim

smiling
up
wistfully

Their
thoughts
were
diverted
by
the
voice
of
the
auctioneer
:
``

this

*NL*
One
by
one
the
articles
went
,
and
the
afternoon
passed
away
.
Jude
*NL*
and
the
other
two
were
getting
tired
and
hungry
,
but
after
the
*NL*
conversation
they
had
heard
they
were
shy
of
going
out
while
the
*NL*
purchasers
were
in
their
line
of
retreat
.
However
,
the
later
lots
*NL*
drew
on
,
and
it
became
necessary
to
emerge
into
the
rain
soon
,
to
*NL*
take
on
Sue
's
things
to
their
temporary
lodging
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
the
next
lot
:
two
pairs
of
pigeons

all
alive
and
plump

a
nice

pie

somebody
for
next
Sunday
's
dinner

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
impending
sale
of
these
birds
had
been
the
most
trying
suspense
*NL*
of
the
whole
afternoon
.
They
were
Sue
's
pets
,
and
when
it
was
found
*NL*
that
they
could
not
possibly
be
kept
,
more
sadness
was
caused
than
by
*NL*
parting
from
all
the
furniture
.
Sue
tried
to
think
away
her
tears
*NL*
as
she
heard
the
trifling
sum
that
her
dears
were
deemed
to
be
worth
*NL*
advanced
by
small
stages
to
the
price
at
which
they
were
finally
*NL*
knocked
down
.
The
purchaser
was
a
neighbouring
poulterer
,
and
they
*NL*
were
unquestionably
doomed
to
die
before
the
next
market
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Noting
her
dissembled
distress
Jude
kissed
her
,
and
said
it
was
time
*NL*
to
go
and
see
if
the
lodgings
were
ready
.
He
would
go
on
with
the
*NL*
boy
,
and
fetch
her
soon
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
was
left
alone
she
waited
patiently
,
but
Jude
did
not
come
*NL*
back
.
At
last
she
started
,
the
coast
being
clear
,
and
on
passing
the
*NL*
poulterer
's
shop
,
not
far
off
,
she
saw
her
pigeons
in
a
hamper
by
the
*NL*
door
.
An
emotion
at
sight
of
them
,
assisted
by
the
growing
dusk
of
*NL*
evening
,
caused
her
to
act
on
impulse
,
and
first
looking
around
her
*NL*
quickly
,
she
pulled
out
the
peg
which
fastened
down
the
cover
,
and
*NL*
went
on
.
The
cover
was
lifted
from
within
,
and
the
pigeons
flew
*NL*
away
with
a
clatter
that
brought
the
chagrined
poulterer
cursing
and
*NL*
swearing
to
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sue
reached
the
lodging
trembling
,
and
found
Jude
and
the
boy
making
*NL*
it
comfortable
for
her
.
``
Do
the
buyers
pay
before
they
bring
away
*NL*
the
things
?
''
she
asked
breathlessly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
think
.
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
,
then
,
I
've
done
such
a
wicked
thing
!
''
And
she
explained
,
*NL*
in
bitter
contrition
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
have
to
pay
the
poulterer
for
them
,
if
he
does
n't
catch
*NL*
them
,
''
said
Jude
.
``
But
never
mind
.
Do
n't
fret
about
it
,
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
so
foolish
of
me
!
Oh
why
should
Nature
's
law
be
mutual
*NL*
butchery
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
so
,
Mother
?
''
asked
the
boy
intently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
!
''
said
Sue
vehemently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
they
must
take
their
chance
,
now
,
poor
things
,
''
said
Jude
.
*NL*
``
As
soon
as
the
sale-account
is
wound
up
,
and
our
bills
paid
,
we
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
do
we
go
to
?
''
asked
Time
,
in
suspense
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
sail
under
sealed
orders
,
that
nobody
may
trace
us
...
We
*NL*
must
n't
go
to
Alfredston
,
or
to
Melchester
,
or
to
Shaston
,
or
to
*NL*
Christminster
.
Apart
from
those
we
may
go
anywhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
must
n't
we
go
there
,
Father
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
of
a
cloud
that
has
gathered
over
us
;
though
`
we
have
*NL*
wronged
no
man
,
corrupted
no
man
,
defrauded
no
man
!
'
Though
perhaps
*NL*
we
have
`
done
that
which
was
right
in
our
own
eyes
.

VII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
From
that
week
Jude
Fawley
and
Sue
walked
no
more
in
the
town
of
*NL*
Aldbrickham
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whither
they
had
gone
nobody
knew
,
chiefly
because
nobody
cared
*NL*
to
know
.
Any
one
sufficiently
curious
to
trace
the
steps
of
such
*NL*
an
obscure
pair
might
have
discovered
without
great
trouble
that
*NL*
they
had
taken
advantage
of
his
adaptive
craftsmanship
to
enter
*NL*
on
a
shifting
,
almost
nomadic
,
life
,
which
was
not
without
its
*NL*
pleasantness
for
a
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wherever
Jude
heard
of
free-stone
work
to
be
done
,
thither
he
went
,
*NL*
choosing
by
preference
places
remote
from
his
old
haunts
and
Sue
's
.
*NL*
He
laboured
at
a
job
,
long
or
briefly
,
till
it
was
finished
;
and
*NL*
then
moved
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
whole
years
and
a
half
passed
thus
.
Sometimes
he
might
have
*NL*
been
found
shaping
the
mullions
of
a
country
mansion
,
sometimes
*NL*
setting
the
parapet
of
a
town-hall
,
sometimes
ashlaring
an
hotel
at
*NL*
Sandbourne
,
sometimes
a
museum
at
Casterbridge
,
sometimes
as
far
down
*NL*
as
Exonbury
,
sometimes
at
Stoke-Barehills
.
Later
still
he
was
at
*NL*
Kennetbridge
,
a
thriving
town
not
more
than
a
dozen
miles
south
of
*NL*
Marygreen
,
this
being
his
nearest
approach
to
the
village
where
he
*NL*
was
known
;
for
he
had
a
sensitive
dread
of
being
questioned
as
to
his
*NL*
life
and
fortunes
by
those
who
had
been
acquainted
with
him
during
*NL*
his
ardent
young
manhood
of
study
and
promise
,
and
his
brief
and
*NL*
unhappy
married
life
at
that
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
some
of
these
places
he
would
be
detained
for
months
,
at
others
*NL*
only
a
few
weeks
.
His
curious
and
sudden
antipathy
to
ecclesiastical
*NL*
work
,
both
episcopal
and
noncomformist
,
which
had
risen
in
him
when
*NL*
suffering
under
a
smarting
sense
of
misconception
,
remained
with
him
*NL*
in
cold
blood
,
less
from
any
fear
of
renewed
censure
than
from
an
*NL*
ultra-conscientiousness
which
would
not
allow
him
to
seek
a
living
*NL*
out
of
those
who
would
disapprove
of
his
ways
;
also
,
too
,
from
a
*NL*
sense
of
inconsistency
between
his
former
dogmas
and
his
present
*NL*
practice
,
hardly
a
shred
of
the
beliefs
with
which
he
had
first
*NL*
gone
up
to
Christminster
now
remaining
with
him
.
He
was
mentally
*NL*
approaching
the
position
which
Sue
had
occupied
when
he
first
met
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
a
Saturday
evening
in
May
,
nearly
three
years
after
Arabella
's
*NL*
recognition
of
Sue
and
himself
at
the
agricultural
show
,
some
of
*NL*
those
who
there
encountered
each
other
met
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
spring
fair
at
Kennetbridge
,
and
,
though
this
ancient
*NL*
trade-meeting
had
much
dwindled
from
its
dimensions
of
former
times
,
*NL*
the
long
straight
street
of
the
borough
presented
a
lively
scene
*NL*
about
midday
.
At
this
hour
a
light
trap
,
among
other
vehicles
,
*NL*
was
driven
into
the
town
by
the
north
road
,
and
up
to
the
door
of
*NL*
a
temperance
inn
.
There
alighted
two
women
,
one
the
driver
,
an
*NL*
ordinary
country
person
,
the
other
a
finely
built
figure
in
the
deep
*NL*
mourning
of
a
widow
.
Her
sombre
suit
,
of
pronounced
cut
,
caused
*NL*
her
to
appear
a
little
out
of
place
in
the
medley
and
bustle
of
a
*NL*
provincial
fair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
just
find
out
where
it
is
,
Anny
,
''
said
the
widow-lady
to
her
*NL*
companion
,
when
the
horse
and
cart
had
been
taken
by
a
man
who
came
*NL*
forward
:
``
and
then
I
'll
come
back
,
and
meet
you
here
;
and
we
'll
go
*NL*
in
and
have
something
to
eat
and
drink
.
I
begin
to
feel
quite
a
*NL*
sinking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
all
my
heart
,
''
said
the
other
.
``
Though
I
would
sooner
have
*NL*
put
up
at
the
Chequers
or
The
Jack
.
You
ca
n't
get
much
at
these
*NL*
temperance
houses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
do
n't
you
give
way
to
gluttonous
desires
,
my
child
,
''
said
the
*NL*
woman
in
weeds
reprovingly
.
``
This
is
the
proper
place
.
Very
well
:
*NL*
we
'll
meet
in
half
an
hour
,
unless
you
come
with
me
to
find
out
where
*NL*
the
site
of
the
new
chapel
is
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
care
to
.
You
can
tell
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
companions
then
went
their
several
ways
,
the
one
in
crape
walking
*NL*
firmly
along
with
a
mien
of
disconnection
from
her
miscellaneous
*NL*
surroundings
.
Making
inquiries
she
came
to
a
hoarding
,
within
which
*NL*
were
excavations
denoting
the
foundations
of
a
building
;
and
on
*NL*
the
boards
without
one
or
two
large
posters
announcing
that
the
*NL*
foundation-stone
of
the
chapel
about
to
be
erected
would
be
laid
that
*NL*
afternoon
at
three
o'clock
by
a
London
preacher
of
great
popularity
*NL*
among
his
body
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
ascertained
thus
much
the
immensely
weeded
widow
retraced
her
*NL*
steps
,
and
gave
herself
leisure
to
observe
the
movements
of
the
fair
.
*NL*
By
and
by
her
attention
was
arrested
by
a
little
stall
of
cakes
and
*NL*
ginger-breads
,
standing
between
the
more
pretentious
erections
of
*NL*
trestles
and
canvas
.
It
was
covered
with
an
immaculate
cloth
,
and
*NL*
tended
by
a
young
woman
apparently
unused
to
the
business
,
she
being
*NL*
accompanied
by
a
boy
with
an
octogenarian
face
,
who
assisted
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
--
senses
!
''
murmured
the
widow
to
herself
.
``
His
wife
Sue
--
if
*NL*
she
is
so
!
''
She
drew
nearer
to
the
stall
.
``
How
do
you
do
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Fawley
?
''
she
said
blandly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sue
changed
colour
and
recognized
Arabella
through
the
crape
veil
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
are
you
,
Mrs.
Cartlett
?
''
she
said
stiffly
.
And
then
perceiving
*NL*
Arabella
's
garb
her
voice
grew
sympathetic
in
spite
of
herself
.
*NL*
``
What
?
--
you
have
lost
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
poor
husband
.
Yes
.
He
died
suddenly
,
six
weeks
ago
,
leaving
me
*NL*
none
too
well
off
,
though
he
was
a
kind
husband
to
me
.
But
whatever
*NL*
profit
there
is
in
public-house
keeping
goes
to
them
that
brew
the
*NL*
liquors
,
and
not
to
them
that
retail
'em
...
And
you
,
my
little
old
*NL*
man
!
You
do
n't
know
me
,
I
expect
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
do
.
You
be
the
woman
I
thought
wer
my
mother
for
a
bit
,
till
*NL*
I
found
you
was
n't

''
replied
Father
Time
,
who
had
learned
to
use
the
*NL*
Wessex
tongue
quite
naturally
by
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
.
Never
mind
.
I
am
a
friend

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Juey
,
''
said
Sue
suddenly
,
``
go
down
to
the
station
platform
with
this
*NL*
tray

there
's
another
train
coming
in
,
I
think

''
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
was
gone
Arabella
continued
:
``
He
'll
never
be
a
beauty

he

poor
chap

Does
he
know
I
am

mother
really

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

He
thinks
there
is
some
mystery
about
his
parentage

that
's
all

*NL*
Jude
is
going
to
tell
him
when
he
is
a
little
older
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
do
you
come
to
be
doing
this
?
I
am
surprised

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
only
a
temporary
occupation

a
fancy
of
ours
while
we
are
in
a
*NL*
difficulty

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
are

*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
another
coming
soon

''
*NL*
*NL*
Sue
writhed
under
the
hard
and
direct
questioning
,
and
her
tender
*NL*
little
mouth
began
to
quiver
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
--
I
mean
goodness
gracious
--
what
is
there
to
cry
about
?
Some
*NL*
folks
would
be
proud
enough
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
that
I
am
ashamed

not
as
you
think
!
But
it
seems
*NL*
such
a
terribly
tragic
thing
to
bring
beings
into
the
world
--
so
*NL*
presumptuous
--
that
I
question
my
right
to
do
it
sometimes
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
it
easy

my
dear

But
you
do
n't
tell
me
why
you
do
such
a
*NL*
thing
as
this
?
Jude
used
to
be
a
proud
sort
of
chap
--
above
any
*NL*
business
almost
,
leave
alone
keeping
a
standing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
my
husband
has
altered
a
little
since
then
.
I
am
sure
he

is
not
proud
now
!
''
And
Sue
's
lips
quivered
again
.
``
I
am
doing
this
*NL*
because
he
caught
a
chill
early
in
the
year
while
putting
up
some
*NL*
stonework
of
a
music-hall
,
at
Quartershot
,
which
he
had
to
do
in
the
*NL*
rain
,
the
work
having
to
be
executed
by
a
fixed
day
.
He
is
better
*NL*
than
he
was
;
but
it
has
been
a
long
,
weary
time
!
We
have
had
an
old
*NL*
widow
friend
with
us
to
help
us
through
it
;
but
she
's
leaving
soon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
am
respectable
too
,
thank
God
,
and
of
a
serious
way
of
*NL*
thinking
since
my
loss
.
Why
did
you
choose
to
sell
gingerbreads
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
pure
accident

He
was
brought
up
to
the
baking
business
,
*NL*
and
it
occurred
to
him
to
try
his
hand
at
these
,
which
he
can
make
*NL*
without
coming
out
of
doors
.
We
call
them
Christminster
cakes

*NL*
They
are
a
great
success

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
saw
any
like
'em

Why
,
they
are
windows
and
towers
,

*NL*
pinnacles
!
And
upon
my
word
they
are
very
nice
.
''
She
had
helped
*NL*
herself
,
and
was
unceremoniously
munching
one
of
the
cakes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

They
are
reminiscences
of
the
Christminster
Colleges

*NL*
Traceried
windows

cloisters

you
see

It
was
a
whim
of
his

to
do
them
in
pastry

*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
harping
on
Christminster

even
in

laughed
*NL*
Arabella

``
Just

A
ruling
passion

he
is

always
will

*NL*
*NL*
Sue
sighed
,
and
she
looked
her
distress
at
hearing
him
criticized
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do

Come
now

him

*NL*
*NL*
``
Of

Christminster
is
a
sort
of
fixed
vision
with
him

which
*NL*
I
suppose
he
'll
never
be
cured
of
believing
in

He
still
thinks
it
*NL*
a
great
centre
of
high
and
fearless
thought

of
what
it
is

of

schoolmasters

characteristic

timid

obsequiousness

.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Arabella
was
quizzing
Sue
with
more
regard
of
how
she
was
speaking
*NL*
than
of
what
she
was
saying
.
``
How
odd
to
hear
a
woman
selling
*NL*
cakes
talk
like
that
!
''
she
said
.
``
Why
do
n't
you
go
back
to
*NL*
school-keeping
?

*NL*
*NL*
She
shook
her
head
.
``
They
wo
n't
have
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
of
the
divorce
,
I
suppose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
and
other
things
.
And
there
is
no
reason
to
wish
it

We
*NL*
gave
up
all
ambition

and
were
never
so
happy
in
our
lives
till
his
*NL*
illness
came

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
you

care
to
say

*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
in
Kennetbridge
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sue
's
manner
showed
Arabella
that
her
random
guess
was
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
comes
the
boy
back
again
,
''
continued
Arabella
.
``
My
boy
and
*NL*
Jude

*NL*
*NL*
Sue
's
eyes
darted
a
spark
.
``
You
need
n't
throw
that
in
my
face

she
*NL*
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well

though
I
half-feel
as

have
him
with

Lord
,
I
do
n't
want
to
take
him
from

I
should
*NL*
sin
to
speak
so
profane

I
should
think
you
must
have
enough
*NL*
of
your
own
!
He
's
in
very
good
hands
,
that
I
know
;
and
I
am
not
the
*NL*
woman
to
find
fault
with
what
the
Lord
has
ordained
.
I
've
reached
a
*NL*
more
resigned
frame
of
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
!
I
wish
I
had
been
able
to
do
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
try

''
replied
the
widow
,
from
the
serene
heights
of
a
*NL*
soul
conscious
not
only
of
spiritual
but
of
social
superiority
.
*NL*
``
I
make
no
boast
of
my
awakening
,
but
I
'm
not
what
I
was
.
After
*NL*
Cartlett
's
death
I
was
passing
the
chapel
in
the
street
next
ours
,
*NL*
and
went
into
it
for
shelter
from
a
shower
of
rain
.
I
felt
a
need
*NL*
of
some
sort
of
support
under
my
loss
,
and
,
as
't
was
righter
than
*NL*
gin
,
I
took
to
going
there
regular
,
and
found
it
a
great
comfort
.
*NL*
But
I
've
left
London
now
,
you
know
,
and
at
present
I
am
living
at
*NL*
Alfredston
,
with
my
friend
Anny
,
to
be
near
my
own
old
country
.
I
'm
*NL*
not
come
here
to
the
fair
to-day
.
There
's
to
be
the
foundation-stone
*NL*
of
a
new
chapel
laid
this
afternoon
by
a
popular
London
preacher
,
and
*NL*
I
drove
over
with
Anny
.
Now
I
must
go
back
to
meet
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Arabella
wished
Sue
good-bye
,
and
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
VIII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
afternoon
Sue
and
the
other
people
bustling
about
Kennetbridge
*NL*
fair
could
hear
singing
inside
the
placarded
hoarding
farther
down
*NL*
the
street
.
Those
who
peeped
through
the
opening
saw
a
crowd
of
*NL*
persons
in
broadcloth
,
with
hymn-books
in
their
hands
,
standing
round
*NL*
the
excavations
for
the
new
chapel-walls
.
Arabella
Cartlett
and
her
*NL*
weeds
stood
among
them
.
She
had
a
clear
,
powerful
voice
,
which
could
*NL*
be
distinctly
heard
with
the
rest
,
rising
and
falling
to
the
tune
,
*NL*
her
inflated
bosom
being
also
seen
doing
likewise
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
two
hours
later
on
the
same
day
that
Anny
and
Mrs.
Cartlett
,
*NL*
having
had
tea
at
the
Temperance
Hotel
,
started
on
their
return
*NL*
journey
across
the
high
and
open
country
which
stretches
between
*NL*
Kennetbridge
and
Alfredston
.
Arabella
was
in
a
thoughtful
mood
;
but
*NL*
her
thoughts
were
not
of
the
new
chapel
,
as
Anny
at
first
surmised
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
it
is
something
else
,
''
at
last
said
Arabella
sullenly
.
``
I
*NL*
came
here
to-day
never
thinking
of
anybody
but
poor
Cartlett
,
or
of
*NL*
anything
but
spreading
the
Gospel
by
means
of
this
new
tabernacle
*NL*
they
've
begun
this
afternoon
.
But
something
has
happened
to
turn
my
*NL*
mind
another
way
quite
.
Anny
,
I
've
heard
of
un
again
,
and
I
've
seen
*NL*
HER
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
heard
of
Jude
,
and
I
've
seen
his
wife
.
And
ever
since
,
do
what
*NL*
I
will
,
and
though
I
sung
the
hymns
wi
'
all
my
strength
,
I
have
not
*NL*
been
able
to
help
thinking
about
`
n
;
which
I
've
no
right
to
do
as
a
*NL*
chapel
member
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ca
n't
ye
fix
your
mind
upon
what
was
said
by
the
London
preacher
*NL*
to-day
,
and
try
to
get
rid
of
your
wandering
fancies
that
way
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
.
But
my
wicked
heart
will
ramble
off
in
spite
of
myself

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

I
know
what
it
is
to
have
a
wanton
mind

my

too
!

you
on

knew
what
I
do
dream
sometimes
o

nights
quite
against
my
*NL*
wishes
,
you
'd
say
I
had
my
struggles
!
''
-LRB-
Anny
,
too
,
had
grown
rather
*NL*
serious
of
late
,
her
lover
having
jilted
her
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
shall
I
do
about
it
?
''
urged
Arabella
morbidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
could
take
a
lock
of
your
late-lost
husband
's
hair
,
and
have
it
*NL*
made
into
a
mourning
brooch
,
and
look
at
it
every
hour
of
the
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
a
morsel
!
--
and
if
I
had
`
twould
be
no
good

After
all
*NL*
that
's
said
about
the
comforts
of
this
religion
,
I
wish
I
had
Jude
*NL*
back
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
fight
valiant
against
the
feeling
,
since
he
's
another
's
.
*NL*
And
I
've
heard
that
another
good
thing
for
it
,
when
it
afflicts
*NL*
volupshious
widows
,
is
to
go
to
your
husband
's
grave
in
the
dusk
of
*NL*
evening
,
and
stand
a
long
while
a-bowed
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pooh
!
I
know
as
well
as
you
what
I
should
do
;
only
I
do
n't
do
it

*NL*
*NL*
They
drove
in
silence
along
the
straight
road
till
they
were
within
*NL*
the
horizon
of
Marygreen
,
which
lay
not
far
to
the
left
of
their
*NL*
route
.
They
came
to
the
junction
of
the
highway
and
the
cross-lane
*NL*
leading
to
that
village
,
whose
church-tower
could
be
seen
athwart
the
*NL*
hollow
.
When
they
got
yet
farther
on
,
and
were
passing
the
lonely
*NL*
house
in
which
Arabella
and
Jude
had
lived
during
the
first
months
of
*NL*
their
marriage
,
and
where
the
pig-killing
had
taken
place
,
she
could
*NL*
control
herself
no
longer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
more
mine
than
hers
!
''
she
burst
out
.
``
What
right
has
she
to
*NL*
him
,
I
should
like
to
know
!
I
'd
take
him
from
her
if
I
could

*NL*
*NL*
``
Fie

Abby
!
And
your
husband
only
six
weeks
gone

Pray
against

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
damned
if
I
do
!
Feelings
are

I
wo
n't
be
a
creeping
*NL*
hypocrite
any
longer
--
so
there
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Arabella
had
hastily
drawn
from
her
pocket
a
bundle
of
tracts
which
*NL*
she
had
brought
with
her
to
distribute
at
the
fair
,
and
of
which
she
*NL*
had
given
away
several
.
As
she
spoke
she
flung
the
whole
remainder
*NL*
of
the
packet
into
the
hedge
.
``
I
've
tried
that
sort
o

physic

*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush

Now

tea
,

do

talk

We
wo

out
this
road
again

so

You
'll
be
all

again
soon

''
*NL*
*NL*
Arabella
did
calm
herself
down
by
degrees
;
and
they
crossed
the
*NL*
ridge-way
.
When
they
began
to
descend
the
long
,
straight
hill
,
they
*NL*
saw
plodding
along
in
front
of
them
an
elderly
man
of
spare
stature
*NL*
and
thoughtful
gait
.
In
his
hand
he
carried
a
basket
;
and
there
was
*NL*
a
touch
of
slovenliness
in
his
attire
,
together
with
that
indefinable
*NL*
something
in
his
whole
appearance
which
suggested
one
who
was
his
*NL*
own
housekeeper
,
purveyor
,
confidant
,
and
friend
,
through
possessing
*NL*
nobody
else
at
all
in
the
world
to
act
in
those
capacities
for
him
.
*NL*
The
remainder
of
the
journey
was
down-hill
,
and
guessing
him
to
be
*NL*
going
to
Alfredston
they
offered
him
a
lift
,
which
he
accepted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arabella
looked
at
him
,
and
looked
again
,
till
at
length
she
spoke
.
*NL*
``
If
I
do
n't
mistake
I
am
talking
to
Mr.
Phillotson

*NL*
*NL*
The
wayfarer
faced
round
and
regarded
her
in
turn
.
``
Yes
;
my
name
is
*NL*
Phillotson

he
said
.
``

*NL*

your
scholars

I
used
to
walk
up
there
from

Cresscombe

had
only
a

down
at

shook
his

said
politely
,

Phillotson

with
sudden

The
pressure
of
a
sadness
that
would
out
unsealed
him

he
replied

because
they
did
n't
care
to
.
She
was
quite
innocent
of
*NL*
what
obtained
you
your
freedom
,
at
the
time
you
obtained
it
.
I
saw
*NL*
her
just
afterwards
,
and
proved
it
to
myself
completely
by
talking
to
*NL*
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Phillotson
grasped
the
edge
of
the
spring-cart
,
and
appeared
to
be
*NL*
much
stressed
and
worried
by
the
information
.
``
Still
--
she
wanted
to
*NL*
go
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
But
you
should
n't
have
let
her
.
That
's
the
only
way
with
*NL*
these
fanciful
women
that
chaw
high
--
innocent
or
guilty
.
She
'd
have
*NL*
come
round
in
time
.
We
all
do
!
Custom
does
it
!
It
's
all
the
same
*NL*
in
the
end
!
However
,
I
think
she
's
fond
of
her
man
still
--
whatever
*NL*
he
med
be
of
her
.
You
were
too
quick
about
her
.
_
I
_
should
n't
*NL*
have
let
her
go
!
I
should
have
kept
her
chained
on
--
her
spirit
for
*NL*
kicking
would
have
been
broke
soon
enough
!
There
's
nothing
like
*NL*
bondage
and
a
stone-deaf
taskmaster
for
taming
us
women
.
Besides
,
*NL*
you
've
got
the
laws
on
your
side
.
Moses
knew
.
Do
n't
you
call
to
*NL*
mind
what
he
says
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
for
the
moment
,
ma'am
,
I
regret
to
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Call
yourself
a
schoolmaster
!
I
used
to
think
o

t
when
they
read
*NL*
it
in
church
,
and
I
was
carrying
on
a
bit
.
`
Then
shall
the
man
be
*NL*
guiltless
;
but
the
woman
shall
bear
her
iniquity

Damn
rough
on

we
must
grin

put
up

Haw

Well

's
got
*NL*
her
deserts
now

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Phillotson
,
with
biting
sadness
.
``
Cruelty
is
the
law
*NL*
pervading
all
nature
and
society
;
and
we
ca
n't
get
out
of
it
if
we
*NL*
would
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

do
n't
you
forget
to
try
it
next
time

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
answer
you

madam

I
have
never
known
much
of

''
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
now
reached
the
low
levels
bordering
Alfredston
,
and
passing
*NL*
through
the
outskirts
approached
a
mill
,
to
which
Phillotson
said
his
*NL*
errand
led
him
;
whereupon
they
drew
up
,
and
he
alighted
,
bidding
them
*NL*
good-night
in
a
preoccupied
mood
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
Sue
,
though
remarkably
successful
in
her
cake-selling
*NL*
experiment
at
Kennetbridge
fair
,
had
lost
the
temporary
brightness
*NL*
which
had
begun
to
sit
upon
her
sadness
on
account
of
that
success
.
*NL*
When
all
her
``
Christminster
''
cakes
had
been
disposed
of
she
took
*NL*
upon
her
arm
the
empty
basket
,
and
the
cloth
which
had
covered
the
*NL*
standing
she
had
hired
,
and
giving
the
other
things
to
the
boy
left
*NL*
the
street
with
him
.
They
followed
a
lane
to
a
distance
of
half
a
*NL*
mile
,
till
they
met
an
old
woman
carrying
a
child
in
short
clothes
,
*NL*
and
leading
a
toddler
in
the
other
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sue
kissed
the
children
,
and
said
,
``
How
is
he
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
better
!
''
returned
Mrs.
Edlin
cheerfully
.
``
Before
you
are
*NL*
upstairs
again
your
husband
will
be
well
enough
--
do
n't
`
ee
trouble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
turned
,
and
came
to
some
old
,
dun-tiled
cottages
with
gardens
*NL*
and
fruit-trees
.
Into
one
of
these
they
entered
by
lifting
the
latch
*NL*
without
knocking
,
and
were
at
once
in
the
general
living-room
.
Here
*NL*
they
greeted
Jude
,
who
was
sitting
in
an
arm-chair
,
the
increased
*NL*
delicacy
of
his
normally
delicate
features
,
and
the
childishly
*NL*
expectant
look
in
his
eyes
,
being
alone
sufficient
to
show
that
he
*NL*
had
been
passing
through
a
severe
illness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
--
you
have
sold
them
all
?
''
he
said
,
a
gleam
of
interest
lighting
*NL*
up
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
Arcades
,
gables
,
east
windows
and
all
.
''
She
told
him
the
*NL*
pecuniary
results
,
and
then
hesitated
.
At
last
,
when
they
were
left
*NL*
alone
,
she
informed
him
of
the
unexpected
meeting
with
Arabella
,
and
*NL*
the
latter
's
widowhood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
was
discomposed
.
``
What
--
is
she
living
here
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
at
Alfredston
,
''
said
Sue
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
's
countenance
remained
clouded
.
``
I
thought
I
had
better
tell
*NL*
you
?
''
she
continued
,
kissing
him
anxiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
...
Dear
me
!
Arabella
not
in
the
depths
of
London
,
but
down
*NL*
here
!
It
is
only
a
little
over
a
dozen
miles
across
the
country
to
*NL*
Alfredston
.
What
is
she
doing
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
told
him
all
she
knew
.
``
She
has
taken
to
chapel-going
,
''
Sue
*NL*
added
;
``
and
talks
accordingly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Jude
,
``
perhaps
it
is
for
the
best
that
we
have
almost
*NL*
decided
to
move
on
.
I
feel
much
better
to-day
,
and
shall
be
well
*NL*
enough
to
leave
in
a
week
or
two
.
Then
Mrs.
Edlin
can
go
home
*NL*
again
--
dear
faithful
old
soul
--
the
only
friend
we
have
in
the
world
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
do
you
think
to
go
to
?
''
Sue
asked
,
a
troublousness
in
her
*NL*
tones
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Jude
confessed
what
was
in
his
mind
.
He
said
it
would
surprise
*NL*
her
,
perhaps
,
after
his
having
resolutely
avoided
all
the
old
places
*NL*
for
so
long
.
But
one
thing
and
another
had
made
him
think
a
great
*NL*
deal
of
Christminster
lately
,
and
,
if
she
did
n't
mind
,
he
would
like
*NL*
to
go
back
there
.
Why
should
they
care
if
they
were
known
?
It
was
*NL*
oversensitive
of
them
to
mind
so
much
.
They
could
go
on
selling
*NL*
cakes
there
,
for
that
matter
,
if
he
could
n't
work
.
He
had
no
sense
*NL*
of
shame
at
mere
poverty
;
and
perhaps
he
would
be
as
strong
as
ever
*NL*
soon
,
and
able
to
set
up
stone-cutting
for
himself
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
you
care
so
much
for
Christminster
?
''
she
said
pensively
.
*NL*
``
Christminster
cares
nothing
for
you
,
poor
dear
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
do
,
I
ca
n't
help
it
.
I
love
the
place
--
although
I
know
*NL*
how
it
hates
all
men
like
me
--
the
so-called
self-taught
--
how
it
*NL*
scorns
our
laboured
acquisitions
,
when
it
should
be
the
first
*NL*
to
respect
them
;
how
it
sneers
at
our
false
quantities
and
*NL*
mispronunciations
,
when
it
should
say
,
I
see
you
want
help
,
my
poor
*NL*
friend
!
...
Nevertheless
,
it
is
the
centre
of
the
universe
to
me
,
*NL*
because
of
my
early
dream
:
and
nothing
can
alter
it
.
Perhaps
it
will
*NL*
soon
wake
up
,
and
be
generous
.
I
pray
so
!
...
I
should
like
to
go
*NL*
back
to
live
there
--
perhaps
to
die
there
!
In
two
or
three
weeks
I
*NL*
might
,
I
think
.
It
will
then
be
June
,
and
I
should
like
to
be
there
*NL*
by
a
particular
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
hope
that
he
was
recovering
proved
so
far
well
grounded
that
*NL*
in
three
weeks
they
had
arrived
in
the
city
of
many
memories
;
were
*NL*
actually
treading
its
pavements
,
receiving
the
reflection
of
the
*NL*
sunshine
from
its
wasting
walls

On
their
arrival
the
station
was
lively
with
straw-hatted
young
men
,
*NL*
welcoming
young
girls
who
bore
a
remarkable
family
likeness
to
their

who
were
dressed
up
in
the

of

*NL*
*NL*
``

said

quietly
,
as
he
took
charge
of
the
small
child
,
and
*NL*
told
Arabella
's
boy
to
keep
close
to
them
,
Sue
attending
to
their
own

eldest
.

looking
anxiously
at

him
up
and
down

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

do
before

shall
be
settled
here

The
first

is

lodgings

''
*NL*
*NL*
Having
left
their
luggage
and
his
tools
at
the
station
they
proceeded
*NL*
on
foot
up
the
familiar
street
,
the
holiday
people
all
drifting
in
*NL*
the
same
direction
.
Reaching
the
Fourways
they
were
about
to
turn
*NL*
off
to
where
accommodation
was
likely
to
be
found
when
,
looking
at
*NL*
the
clock
and
the
hurrying
crowd
,
Jude
said
:
``
Let
us
go
and
see
the
*NL*
procession
,
and
never
mind
the
lodgings
just
now

We
can
get
them
*NL*
afterwards

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ought
n't
we
to
get
a
house
over
our

first
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
his
soul
seemed
full
of
the
anniversary
,
and
together
they
went
*NL*
down
Chief
Street
,
their
smallest
child
in
Jude
's
arms
,
Sue
leading
*NL*
her
little
girl
,
and
Arabella
's
boy
walking
thoughtfully
and
silently
*NL*
beside
them
.
Crowds
of
pretty
sisters
in
airy
costumes
,
and
meekly
*NL*
ignorant
parents
who
had
known
no
college
in
their
youth
,
were
under
*NL*
convoy
in
the
same
direction
by
brothers
and
sons
bearing
the
opinion
*NL*
written
large
on
them
that
no
properly
qualified
human
beings
had
*NL*
lived
on
earth
till
they
came
to
grace
it
here

*NL*
``
My
failure
is
reflected
on

by
every
one

*NL*
She
saw
from
his
face
that
he
was
getting
into
one
of
his
*NL*
tempestuous
,
self-harrowing
moods
.
``
It
would
have
been
better
if
we
*NL*
had
gone
at
once
about
our

she
answered
.
``
I
am

sure
this

will
awaken

*NL*
``
Well

*NL*
They
turned
in
on
the
left
by
the
church
with
the
Italian
porch
,
*NL*
whose
helical
columns
were
heavily
draped
with
creepers
,
and
pursued
*NL*
the
lane
till
there
arose
on
Jude
's
sight
the
circular
theatre
with
*NL*
that
well-known
lantern
above
it
,
which
stood
in
his
mind
as
the
sad
*NL*
symbol
of
his
abandoned
hopes
,
for
it
was
from
that
outlook
that
he
*NL*
had
finally
surveyed
the
City
of
Colleges
on
the
afternoon
of
his
*NL*
great
meditation
,
which
convinced
him
at
last
of
the
futility
of
his
*NL*
attempt
to
be
a
son
of
the
university
.
*NL*
*NL*
To-day
,
in
the
open
space
stretching
between
this
building
and
the
*NL*
nearest
college
,
stood
a
crowd
of
expectant
people
.
A
passage
was
*NL*
kept
clear
through
their
midst
by
two
barriers
of
timber
,
extending
*NL*
from
the
door
of
the
college
to
the
door
of
the
large
building
*NL*
between
it
and
the
theatre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
is
the
place
--
they
are
just
going
to
pass
!
''
cried
Jude
in
*NL*
sudden
excitement
.
And
pushing
his
way
to
the
front
he
took
up
a
*NL*
position
close
to
the
barrier
,
still
hugging
the
youngest
child
in
*NL*
his
arms
,
while
Sue
and
the
others
kept
immediately
behind
him
.
*NL*
The
crowd
filled
in
at
their
back
,
and
fell
to
talking
,
joking
,
and
*NL*
laughing
as
carriage
after
carriage
drew
up
at
the
lower
door
of
*NL*
the
college
,
and
solemn
stately
figures
in
blood-red
robes
began
to
*NL*
alight
.
The
sky
had
grown
overcast
and
livid
,
and
thunder
rumbled
*NL*
now
and
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
Father
Time
shuddered
.
``
It
do
seem
like
the
Judgment
Day
!
''
he
*NL*
whispered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
only
learned
Doctors
,
''
said
Sue
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
they
waited
big
drops
of
rain
fell
on
their
heads
and
*NL*
shoulders
,
and
the
delay
grew
tedious
.
Sue
again
wished
not
to
stay
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
wo
n't
be
long
now
,
''
said
Jude
,
without
turning
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
procession
did
not
come
forth
,
and
somebody
in
the
crowd
,
to
*NL*
pass
the
time
,
looked
at
the
facade
of
the
nearest
college
,
and
said
*NL*
he
wondered
what
was
meant
by
the
Latin
inscription
in
its
midst
.
*NL*
Jude
,
who
stood
near
the
inquirer
,
explained
it
,
and
finding
that
*NL*
the
people
all
round
him
were
listening
with
interest
,
went
on
to
*NL*
describe
the
carving
of
the
frieze
-LRB-
which
he
had
studied
years
*NL*
before
-RRB-
,
and
to
criticize
some
details
of
masonry
in
other
college
*NL*
fronts
about
the
city
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
idle
crowd
,
including
the
two
policemen
at
the
doors
,
stared
like
*NL*
the
Lycaonians
at
Paul
,
for
Jude
was
apt
to
get
too
enthusiastic
over
*NL*
any
subject
in
hand
,
and
they
seemed
to
wonder
how
the
stranger
*NL*
should
know
more
about
the
buildings
of
their
town
than
they
*NL*
themselves
did
;
till
one
of
them
said
:
``
Why
,
I
know
that
man
;
he
used
*NL*
to
work
here
years
ago
--
Jude
Fawley
,
that
's
his
name
!
Do
n't
you
mind
*NL*
he
used
to
be
nicknamed
Tutor
of
St.
Slums
,
d'ye
mind
?
--
because
he
*NL*
aimed
at
that
line
o
'
business
?
He
's
married
,
I
suppose
,
then
,
and
*NL*
that
's
his
child
he
's
carrying
.
Taylor
would
know
him
,
as
he
knows
*NL*
everybody
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
speaker
was
a
man
named
Jack
Stagg
,
with
whom
Jude
had
formerly
*NL*
worked
in
repairing
the
college
masonries
;
Tinker
Taylor
was
seen
to
*NL*
be
standing
near
.
Having
his
attention
called
the
latter
cried
*NL*
across
the
barriers
to
Jude
:
``
You
've
honoured
us
by
coming
back
*NL*
again
,
my
friend
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
nodded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
'
you
do
n't
seem
to
have
done
any
great
things
for
yourself
by
*NL*
going
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
assented
to
this
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Except
found
more
mouths
to
fill
!
''
This
came
in
a
new
voice
,
and
*NL*
Jude
recognized
its
owner
to
be
Uncle
Joe
,
another
mason
whom
he
had
*NL*
known
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
replied
good-humouredly
that
he
could
not
dispute
it
;
and
from
*NL*
remark
to
remark
something
like
a
general
conversation
arose
between
*NL*
him
and
the
crowd
of
idlers
,
during
which
Tinker
Taylor
asked
Jude
if
*NL*
he
remembered
the
Apostles
'
Creed
in
Latin
still
,
and
the
night
of
*NL*
the
challenge
in
the
public
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
Fortune
did
n't
lie
that
way
?
''
threw
in
Joe
.
``
Yer
powers
was
n't
*NL*
enough
to
carry
`
ee
through
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
answer
them
any
more
!
''
entreated
Sue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
I
like
Christminster
!
''
murmured
little
Time
*NL*
mournfully
,
as
he
stood
submerged
and
invisible
in
the
crowd
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
finding
himself
the
centre
of
curiosity
,
quizzing
,
and
comment
,
*NL*
Jude
was
not
inclined
to
shrink
from
open
declarations
of
what
he
*NL*
had
no
great
reason
to
be
ashamed
of
;
and
in
a
little
while
was
*NL*
stimulated
to
say
in
a
loud
voice
to
the
listening
throng
generally
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
difficult
question
,
my
friends
,
for
any
young
man
--
that
*NL*
question
I
had
to
grapple
with
,
and
which
thousands
are
weighing
*NL*
at
the
present
moment
in
these
uprising
times
--
whether
to
follow
*NL*
uncritically
the
track
he
finds
himself
in
,
without
considering
his
*NL*
aptness
for
it
,
or
to
consider
what
his
aptness
or
bent
may
be
,
and
*NL*
re-shape
his
course
accordingly
.
I
tried
to
do
the
latter
,
and
I
*NL*
failed
.
But
I
do
n't
admit
that
my
failure
proved
my
view
to
be
a
*NL*
wrong
one
,
or
that
my
success
would
have
made
it
a
right
one
;
though
*NL*
that
's
how
we
appraise
such
attempts
nowadays
--
I
mean
,
not
by
their
*NL*
essential
soundness
,
but
by
their
accidental
outcomes
.
If
I
had
*NL*
ended
by
becoming
like
one
of
these
gentlemen
in
red
and
black
that
*NL*
we
saw
dropping
in
here
by
now
,
everybody
would
have
said
:
`
See
how
*NL*
wise
that
young
man
was
,
to
follow
the
bent
of
his
nature
!
'
But
*NL*
having
ended
no
better
than
I
began
they
say
:
`
See
what
a
fool
that
*NL*
fellow
was
in
following
a
freak
of
his
fancy
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
However
it
was
my
poverty
and
not
my
will
that
consented
to
be
*NL*
beaten
.
It
takes
two
or
three
generations
to
do
what
I
tried
to
do
*NL*
in
one
;
and
my
impulses
--
affections
--
vices
perhaps
they
should
be
*NL*
called
--
were
too
strong
not
to
hamper
a
man
without
advantages
;
who
*NL*
should
be
as
cold-blooded
as
a
fish
and
as
selfish
as
a
pig
to
have
a
*NL*
really
good
chance
of
being
one
of
his
country
's
worthies
.
You
may
*NL*
ridicule
me
--
I
am
quite
willing
that
you
should
--
I
am
a
fit
subject
,
*NL*
no
doubt
.
But
I
think
if
you
knew
what
I
have
gone
through
these
*NL*
last
few
years
you
would
rather
pity
me
.
And
if
they
knew
''
--
he
*NL*
nodded
towards
the
college
at
which
the
dons
were
severally
*NL*
arriving
--
``
it
is
just
possible
they
would
do
the
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
do
look
ill
and
worn-out
,
it
is
true
!
''
said
a
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sue
's
face
grew
more
emotional
;
but
though
she
stood
close
to
Jude
*NL*
she
was
screened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
may
do
some
good
before
I
am
dead
--
be
a
sort
of
success
as
a
*NL*
frightful
example
of
what
not
to
do
;
and
so
illustrate
a
moral
*NL*
story
,
''
continued
Jude
,
beginning
to
grow
bitter
,
though
he
had
*NL*
opened
serenely
enough
.
``
I
was
,
perhaps
,
after
all
,
a
paltry
victim
*NL*
to
the
spirit
of
mental
and
social
restlessness
that
makes
so
many
*NL*
unhappy
in
these
days
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
tell
them
that
!
''
whispered
Sue
with
tears
,
at
perceiving
*NL*
Jude
's
state
of
mind
.
``
You
were
n't
that
.
You
struggled
nobly
to
*NL*
acquire
knowledge
,
and
only
the
meanest
souls
in
the
world
would
*NL*
blame
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
shifted
the
child
into
a
more
easy
position
on
his
arm
,
and
*NL*
concluded
:
``
And
what
I
appear
,
a
sick
and
poor
man
,
is
not
the
worst
*NL*
of
me
.
I
am
in
a
chaos
of
principles
--
groping
in
the
dark
--
acting
by
*NL*
instinct
and
not
after
example
.
Eight
or
nine
years
ago
when
I
came
*NL*
here
first
,
I
had
a
neat
stock
of
fixed
opinions
,
but
they
dropped
*NL*
away
one
by
one
;
and
the
further
I
get
the
less
sure
I
am
.
I
doubt
*NL*
if
I
have
anything
more
for
my
present
rule
of
life
than
following
*NL*
inclinations
which
do
me
and
nobody
else
any
harm
,
and
actually
give
*NL*
pleasure
to
those
I
love
best
.
There
,
gentlemen
,
since
you
wanted
to
*NL*
know
how
I
was
getting
on
,
I
have
told
you
.
Much
good
may
it
do
you
!
*NL*
I
can
not
explain
further
here
.
I
perceive
there
is
something
wrong
*NL*
somewhere
in
our
social
formulas
:
what
it
is
can
only
be
discovered
*NL*
by
men
or
women
with
greater
insight
than
mine
--
if
,
indeed
,
they
ever
*NL*
discover
it
--
at
least
in
our
time
.
`
For
who
knoweth
what
is
good
for
*NL*
man
in
this
life
?
--
and
who
can
tell
a
man
what
shall
be
after
him
*NL*
under
the
sun
?
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hear
,
hear
,
''
said
the
populace
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
preached
!
''
said
Tinker
Taylor
.
And
privately
to
his
*NL*
neighbours
:
``
Why
,
one
of
them
jobbing
pa
`
sons
swarming
about
here
,
*NL*
that
takes
the
services
when
our
head
reverends
want
a
holiday
,
*NL*
would
n't
ha
'
discoursed
such
doctrine
for
less
than
a
guinea
down
.
*NL*
Hey
?
I
'll
take
my
oath
not
one
o
'
'em
would
!
And
then
he
must
have
*NL*
had
it
wrote
down
for
`
n.
And
this
only
a
working-man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
a
sort
of
objective
commentary
on
Jude
's
remarks
there
drove
up
*NL*
at
this
moment
with
a
belated
Doctor
,
robed
and
panting
,
a
cab
whose
*NL*
horse
failed
to
stop
at
the
exact
point
required
for
setting
down
the
*NL*
hirer
,
who
jumped
out
and
entered
the
door
.
The
driver
,
alighting
,
*NL*
began
to
kick
the
animal
in
the
belly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
that
can
be
done
,
''
said
Jude
,
``
at
college
gates
in
the
most
*NL*
religious
and
educational
city
in
the
world
,
what
shall
we
say
as
to
*NL*
how
far
we
've
got
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Order
!
''
said
one
of
the
policemen
,
who
had
been
engaged
with
a
*NL*
comrade
in
opening
the
large
doors
opposite
the
college
.
``
Keep
yer
*NL*
tongue
quiet
,
my
man
,
while
the
procession
passes
.
''
The
rain
came
on
*NL*
more
heavily
,
and
all
who
had
umbrellas
opened
them
.
Jude
was
not
*NL*
one
of
these
,
and
Sue
only
possessed
a
small
one
,
half
sunshade
.
She
*NL*
had
grown
pale
,
though
Jude
did
not
notice
it
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
go
on
,
dear
,
''
she
whispered
,
endeavouring
to
shelter
him
.
*NL*
``
We
have
n't
any
lodgings
yet
,
remember
,
and
all
our
things
are
at
the
*NL*
station
;
and
you
are
by
no
means
well
yet
.
I
am
afraid
this
wet
will
*NL*
hurt
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
coming
now
.
Just
a
moment
,
and
I
'll
go
!
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
peal
of
six
bells
struck
out
,
human
faces
began
to
crowd
the
*NL*
windows
around
,
and
the
procession
of
heads
of
houses
and
new
Doctors
*NL*
emerged
,
their
red
and
black
gowned
forms
passing
across
the
field
of
*NL*
Jude
's
vision
like
inaccessible
planets
across
an
object-glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
went
their
names
were
called
by
knowing
informants
,
and
when
*NL*
they
reached
the
old
round
theatre
of
Wren
a
cheer
rose
high
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
go
that
way
!
''
cried
Jude
,
and
though
it
now
rained
steadily
*NL*
he
seemed
not
to
know
it
,
and
took
them
round
to
the
theatre
.
Here
*NL*
they
stood
upon
the
straw
that
was
laid
to
drown
the
discordant
noise
*NL*
of
wheels
,
where
the
quaint
and
frost-eaten
stone
busts
encircling
*NL*
the
building
looked
with
pallid
grimness
on
the
proceedings
,
and
in
*NL*
particular
at
the
bedraggled
Jude
,
Sue
,
and
their
children
,
as
at
*NL*
ludicrous
persons
who
had
no
business
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
I
could
get
in
!
''
he
said
to
her
fervidly
.
``
Listen
--
I
may
*NL*
catch
a
few
words
of
the
Latin
speech
by
staying
here
;
the
windows
*NL*
are
open
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
beyond
the
peals
of
the
organ
,
and
the
shouts
and
hurrahs
*NL*
between
each
piece
of
oratory
,
Jude
's
standing
in
the
wet
did
not
*NL*
bring
much
Latin
to
his
intelligence
more
than
,
now
and
then
,
a
*NL*
sonorous
word
in
_
um
_
or
_
ibus
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
I
'm
an
outsider
to
the
end
of
my
days
!
''
he
sighed
after
a
*NL*
while
.
``
Now
I
'll
go
,
my
patient
Sue
.
How
good
of
you
to
wait
in
the
*NL*
rain
all
this
time
--
to
gratify
my
infatuation
!
I
'll
never
care
any
*NL*
more
about
the
infernal
cursed
place
,
upon
my
soul
I
wo
n't
!
But
what
*NL*
made
you
tremble
so
when
we
were
at
the
barrier
?
And
how
pale
you
*NL*
are
,
Sue
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
saw
Richard
amongst
the
people
on
the
other
side

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

did
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
evidently
come
up
to
Jerusalem
to
see
the
festival
like
the
*NL*
rest
of
us
:
and
on
that
account
is
probably
living
not
so
very
far
*NL*
away
.
He
had
the
same
hankering
for
the
university
that
you
had
,
in
*NL*
a
milder
form
.
I
do
n't
think
he
saw
me
,
though
he
must
have
heard
*NL*
you
speaking
to
the
crowd
.
But
he
seemed
not
to
notice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

suppose
he
did

Your
mind
is
free
from
worries
about
him
now
,
*NL*
my
Sue

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

I
suppose
so

But
I
am
weak

Although
I
know
it
is
all
right
*NL*
with
our
plans
,
I
felt
a
curious
dread
of
him
;
an
awe

or
terror
,
of
*NL*
conventions
I
do
n't
believe
in
.
It
comes
over
me
at
times
like
a
*NL*
sort
of
creeping
paralysis
,
and
makes
me
so
sad
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
getting
tired
,
Sue

Oh

I
forgot
,
darling

Yes

we
'll
go
*NL*
on
at
once

''
*NL*
*NL*
They
started
in
quest
of
the
lodging
,
and
at
last
found
something
*NL*
that
seemed
to
promise
well
,
in
Mildew
Lane
--
a
spot
which
to
Jude
was
*NL*
irresistible
--
though
to
Sue
it
was
not
so
fascinating
--
a
narrow
lane
*NL*
close
to
the
back
of
a
college
,
but
having
no
communication
with
*NL*
it
.
The
little
houses
were
darkened
to
gloom
by
the
high
collegiate
*NL*
buildings
,
within
which
life
was
so
far
removed
from
that
of
the
*NL*
people
in
the
lane
as
if
it
had
been
on
opposite
sides
of
the
globe
;
*NL*
yet
only
a
thickness
of
wall
divided
them
.
Two
or
three
of
the
*NL*
houses
had
notices
of
rooms
to
let
,
and
the
newcomers
knocked
at
the
*NL*
door
of
one
,
which
a
woman
opened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
--
listen
!
''
said
Jude
suddenly
,
instead
of
addressing
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
the
bells
--
what
church
can
that
be
?
The
tones

''
*NL*
*NL*
Another
peal
of
bells
had
begun
to
sound
out
at
some
distance
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
!
''
said
the
landlady
tartly
.
``
Did
you
knock
to
ask
*NL*
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
for
lodgings
,
''
said
Jude
,
coming
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
householder
scrutinized
Sue
's
figure
a
moment
.
``
We
have
n't
any
*NL*
to
let
,
''
said
she
,
shutting
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
looked
discomfited
,
and
the
boy
distressed
.
``
Now
,
Jude
,
''
said
*NL*
Sue
,
``
let
me
try
.
You
do
n't
know
the
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
found
a
second
place
hard
by
;
but
here
the
occupier
,
observing
*NL*
not
only
Sue
,
but
the
boy
and
the
small
children
,
said
civilly
,
``
I
am
*NL*
sorry
to
say
we
do
n't
let
where
there
are
children
''
;
and
also
closed
*NL*
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
small
child
squared
its
mouth
and
cried
silently
,
with
an
*NL*
instinct
that
trouble
loomed
.
The
boy
sighed
.
``
I
do
n't
like
*NL*
Christminster
!
''
he
said
.
``
Are
the
great
old
houses
gaols
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
colleges
,
''
said
Jude
;
``
which
perhaps
you
'll
study
in
some
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
rather
not
!
''
the
boy
rejoined
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
we
'll
try
again
,
''
said
Sue
.
``
I
'll
pull
my
cloak
more
round
*NL*
me
...
Leaving
Kennetbridge
for
this
place
is
like
coming
from
*NL*
Caiaphas
to
Pilate
!
...
How
do
I
look
now
,
dear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nobody
would
notice
it
now
,
''
said
Jude
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
one
other
house
,
and
they
tried
a
third
time
.
The
woman
*NL*
here
was
more
amiable
;
but
she
had
little
room
to
spare
,
and
could
*NL*
only
agree
to
take
in
Sue
and
the
children
if
her
husband
could
go
*NL*
elsewhere
.
This
arrangement
they
perforce
adopted
,
in
the
stress
*NL*
from
delaying
their
search
till
so
late
.
They
came
to
terms
with
*NL*
her
,
though
her
price
was
rather
high
for
their
pockets
.
But
they
*NL*
could
not
afford
to
be
critical
till
Jude
had
time
to
get
a
more
*NL*
permanent
abode
;
and
in
this
house
Sue
took
possession
of
a
back
room
*NL*
on
the
second
floor
with
an
inner
closet-room
for
the
children
.
Jude
*NL*
stayed
and
had
a
cup
of
tea
;
and
was
pleased
to
find
that
the
window
*NL*
commanded
the
back
of
another
of
the
colleges
.
Kissing
all
four
he
*NL*
went
to
get
a
few
necessaries
and
look
for
lodgings
for
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
was
gone
the
landlady
came
up
to
talk
a
little
with
Sue
,
and
*NL*
gather
something
of
the
circumstances
of
the
family
she
had
taken
in
.
*NL*
Sue
had
not
the
art
of
prevarication
,
and
,
after
admitting
several
*NL*
facts
as
to
their
late
difficulties
and
wanderings
,
she
was
startled
*NL*
by
the
landlady
saying
suddenly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
really
a
married
woman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sue
hesitated
;
and
then
impulsively
told
the
woman
that
her
husband
*NL*
and
herself
had
each
been
unhappy
in
their
first
marriages
,
after
*NL*
which
,
terrified
at
the
thought
of
a
second
irrevocable
union
,
and
*NL*
lest
the
conditions
of
the
contract
should
kill
their
love
,
yet
*NL*
wishing
to
be
together
,
they
had
literally
not
found
the
courage
*NL*
to
repeat
it
,
though
they
had
attempted
it
two
or
three
times
.
*NL*
Therefore
,
though
in
her
own
sense
of
the
words
she
was
a
married
*NL*
woman
,
in
the
landlady
's
sense
she
was
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
housewife
looked
embarrassed
,
and
went
downstairs
.
Sue
sat
by
*NL*
the
window
in
a
reverie
,
watching
the
rain
.
Her
quiet
was
broken
by
*NL*
the
noise
of
someone
entering
the
house
,
and
then
the
voices
of
a
*NL*
man
and
woman
in
conversation
in
the
passage
below
.
The
landlady
's
*NL*
husband
had
arrived
,
and
she
was
explaining
to
him
the
incoming
of
*NL*
the
lodgers
during
his
absence
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
voice
rose
in
sudden
anger
.
``
Now
who
wants
such
a
woman
here
?
*NL*
and
perhaps
a
confinement
!
...
Besides
,
did
n't
I
say
I
would
n't
have
*NL*
children
?
The
hall
and
stairs
fresh
painted
,
to
be
kicked
about
by
*NL*
them
!
You
must
have
known
all
was
not
straight
with
'em
--
coming
like
*NL*
that
.
Taking
in
a
family
when
I
said
a
single
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
wife
expostulated
,
but
,
as
it
seemed
,
the
husband
insisted
on
*NL*
his
point
;
for
presently
a
tap
came
to
Sue
's
door
,
and
the
woman
*NL*
appeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
to
tell
you
,
ma'am
,
''
she
said
,
``
that
I
ca
n't
let
you
have
*NL*
the
room
for
the
week
after
all
.
My
husband
objects
;
and
therefore
*NL*
I
must
ask
you
to
go
.
I
do
n't
mind
your
staying
over
to-night
,
as
*NL*
it
is
getting
late
in
the
afternoon
;
but
I
shall
be
glad
if
you
can
*NL*
leave
early
in
the
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Though
she
knew
that
she
was
entitled
to
the
lodging
for
a
week
,
Sue
*NL*
did
not
wish
to
create
a
disturbance
between
the
wife
and
husband
,
*NL*
and
she
said
she
would
leave
as
requested
.
When
the
landlady
had
*NL*
gone
Sue
looked
out
of
the
window
again
.
Finding
that
the
rain
had
*NL*
ceased
she
proposed
to
the
boy
that
,
after
putting
the
little
ones
*NL*
to
bed
,
they
should
go
out
and
search
about
for
another
place
,
and
*NL*
bespeak
it
for
the
morrow
,
so
as
not
to
be
so
hard-driven
then
as
*NL*
they
had
been
that
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Therefore
,
instead
of
unpacking
her
boxes
,
which
had
just
been
sent
*NL*
on
from
the
station
by
Jude
,
they
sallied
out
into
the
damp
though
*NL*
not
unpleasant
streets
,
Sue
resolving
not
to
disturb
her
husband
*NL*
with
the
news
of
her
notice
to
quit
while
he
was
perhaps
worried
*NL*
in
obtaining
a
lodging
for
himself
.
In
the
company
of
the
boy
she
*NL*
wandered
into
this
street
and
into
that
;
but
though
she
tried
a
dozen
*NL*
different
houses
she
fared
far
worse
alone
than
she
had
fared
in
*NL*
Jude
's
company
,
and
could
get
nobody
to
promise
her
a
room
for
the
*NL*
following
day
.
Every
householder
looked
askance
at
such
a
woman
and
*NL*
child
inquiring
for
accommodation
in
the
gloom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ought
not
to
be
born
,
ought
I
?
''
said
the
boy
with
misgiving
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thoroughly
tired
at
last
Sue
returned
to
the
place
where
she
was
*NL*
not
welcome
,
but
where
at
least
she
had
temporary
shelter
.
In
her
*NL*
absence
Jude
had
left
his
address
;
but
knowing
how
weak
he
still
was
*NL*
she
adhered
to
her
determination
not
to
disturb
him
till
the
next
*NL*
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Sue
sat
looking
at
the
bare
floor
of
the
room
,
the
house
being
little
*NL*
more
than
an
old
intramural
cottage
,
and
then
she
regarded
the
scene
*NL*
outside
the
uncurtained
window
.
At
some
distance
opposite
,
the
outer
*NL*
walls
of
Sarcophagus
College
--
silent
,
black
,
and
windowless
--
threw
*NL*
their
four
centuries
of
gloom
,
bigotry
,
and
decay
into
the
little
*NL*
room
she
occupied
,
shutting
out
the
moonlight
by
night
and
the
sun
by
*NL*
day
.
The
outlines
of
Rubric
College
also
were
discernible
beyond
the
*NL*
other
,
and
the
tower
of
a
third
farther
off
still
.
She
thought
of
*NL*
the
strange
operation
of
a
simple-minded
man
's
ruling
passion
,
that
*NL*
it
should
have
led
Jude
,
who
loved
her
and
the
children
so
tenderly
,
*NL*
to
place
them
here
in
this
depressing
purlieu
,
because
he
was
still
*NL*
haunted
by
his
dream
.
Even
now
he
did
not
distinctly
hear
the
*NL*
freezing
negative
that
those
scholared
walls
had
echoed
to
his
*NL*
desire
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
failure
to
find
another
lodging
,
and
the
lack
of
room
in
this
*NL*
house
for
his
father
,
had
made
a
deep
impression
on
the
boy
--
a
*NL*
brooding
undemonstrative
horror
seemed
to
have
seized
him
.
The
*NL*
silence
was
broken
by
his
saying
:
``
Mother
,
WHAT
shall
we
do
*NL*
to-morrow
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
!
''
said
Sue
despondently
.
``
I
am
afraid
this
will
*NL*
trouble
your
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
Father
was
quite
well
,
and
there
had
been
room
for
him
!
*NL*
Then
it
would
n't
matter
so
much
!
Poor
Father
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
n't
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
I
do
anything
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
All
is
trouble
,
adversity
,
and
suffering
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
went
away
to
give
us
children
room
,
did
n't
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Partly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
better
to
be
out
o
'
the
world
than
in
it
,
would
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
almost
,
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
because
of
us
children
,
too
,
is
n't
it
,
that
you
ca
n't
get
a
*NL*
good
lodging
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
people
do
object
to
children
sometimes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
if
children
make
so
much
trouble
,
why
do
people
have
'em
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
because
it
is
a
law
of
nature
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
we
do
n't
ask
to
be
born
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
indeed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
makes
it
worse
with
me
is
that
you
are
not
my
real
mother
,
*NL*
and
you
need
n't
have
had
me
unless
you
liked
.
I
ought
n't
to
have
*NL*
come
to
`
ee
--
that
's
the
real
truth
!
I
troubled
'em
in
Australia
,
*NL*
and
I
trouble
folk
here
.
I
wish
I
had
n't
been
born
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
could
n't
help
it
,
my
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
that
whenever
children
be
born
that
are
not
wanted
they
*NL*
should
be
killed
directly
,
before
their
souls
come
to
'em
,
and
not
*NL*
allowed
to
grow
big
and
walk
about
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sue
did
not
reply
.
She
was
doubtfully
pondering
how
to
treat
this
*NL*
too
reflective
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
at
last
concluded
that
,
so
far
as
circumstances
permitted
,
she
*NL*
would
be
honest
and
candid
with
one
who
entered
into
her
difficulties
*NL*
like
an
aged
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
going
to
be
another
in
our
family
soon
,
''
she
hesitatingly
*NL*
remarked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
going
to
be
another
baby
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
The
boy
jumped
up
wildly
.
``
Oh
God
,
Mother
,
you
've
never
*NL*
a-sent
for
another
;
and
such
trouble
with
what
you
've
got
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
have
,
I
am
sorry
to
say
!
''
murmured
Sue
,
her
eyes
glistening
*NL*
with
suspended
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
burst
out
weeping
.
``
Oh
you
do
n't
care
,
you
do
n't
care
!
''
he
*NL*
cried
in
bitter
reproach
.
``
How
EVER
could
you
,
Mother
,
be
so
wicked
*NL*
and
cruel
as
this
,
when
you
need
n't
have
done
it
till
we
was
better
*NL*
off
,
and
Father
well
!
To
bring
us
all
into
MORE
trouble
!
No
room
*NL*
for
us

and
Father
a-forced
to
go
away

we
turned
out
to-morrow
;
*NL*

yet
you
be
going

have
another
of
us
soon

...
'T
is
done
o

*NL*
purpose

--
't
is

''
He
walked
up
and
down
sobbing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Y-you
must
forgive
me
,
little
Jude
!
''
she
pleaded
,
her
bosom
heaving
*NL*
now
as
much
as
the
boy
's
.
``
I
ca
n't
explain
--
I
will
when
you
are
*NL*
older

It
does
seem

as

had
done
it
on
purpose
,
now
we
are
in
*NL*
these
difficulties
!
I
ca
n't
explain

But
it

is
not
quite
on

purpose

I
ca
n't
help
it
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
it
is
--
it
must
be
!

nobody
would
interfere
with
us

like
*NL*
that

you
agreed
!
I
wo
n't
forgive
you
,
ever
,
ever

I
'll
*NL*
never
believe
you
care
for
me
,
or
Father
,
or
any
of
us
any
more
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
got
up
,
and
went
away
into
the
closet
adjoining
her
room
,
in
which
*NL*
a
bed
had
been
spread
on
the
floor
.
There
she
heard
him
say
:
``
If
we
*NL*
children
was
gone
there
'd
be
no
trouble
at
all
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
think
that
,
dear
,
''
she
cried
,
rather
peremptorily
.
``
But
go
to
*NL*
sleep
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
following
morning
she
awoke
at
a
little
past
six
,
and
decided
*NL*
to
get
up
and
run
across
before
breakfast
to
the
inn
which
Jude
had
*NL*
informed
her
to
be
his
quarters
,
to
tell
him
what
had
happened
before
*NL*
he
went
out
.
She
arose
softly
,
to
avoid
disturbing
the
children
,
*NL*
who
,
as
she
knew
,
must
be
fatigued
by
their
exertions
of
yesterday
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
found
Jude
at
breakfast
in
the
obscure
tavern
he
had
chosen
as
a
*NL*
counterpoise
to
the
expense
of
her
lodging
:
and
she
explained
to
him
*NL*
her
homelessness
.
He
had
been
so
anxious
about
her
all
night
,
he
*NL*
said
.
Somehow
,
now
it
was
morning
,
the
request
to
leave
the
lodgings
*NL*
did
not
seem
such
a
depressing
incident
as
it
had
seemed
the
night
*NL*
before
,
nor
did
even
her
failure
to
find
another
place
affect
her
so
*NL*
deeply
as
at
first
.
Jude
agreed
with
her
that
it
would
not
be
worth
*NL*
while
to
insist
upon
her
right
to
stay
a
week
,
but
to
take
immediate
*NL*
steps
for
removal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
all
come
to
this
inn
for
a
day
or
two
,
''
he
said
.
``
It
is
*NL*
a
rough
place
,
and
it
will
not
be
so
nice
for
the
children
,
but
we
*NL*
shall
have
more
time
to
look
round
.
There
are
plenty
of
lodgings
in
*NL*
the
suburbs
--
in
my
old
quarter
of
Beersheba
.
Have
breakfast
with
me
*NL*
now
you
are
here
,
my
bird
.
You
are
sure
you
are
well
?
There
will
*NL*
be
plenty
of
time
to
get
back
and
prepare
the
children
's
meal
before
*NL*
they
wake
.
In
fact
,
I
'll
go
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
joined
Jude
in
a
hasty
meal
,
and
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
they
*NL*
started
together
,
resolving
to
clear
out
from
Sue
's
too
respectable
*NL*
lodging
immediately
.
On
reaching
the
place
and
going
upstairs
she
*NL*
found
that
all
was
quiet
in
the
children
's
room
,
and
called
to
the
*NL*
landlady
in
timorous
tones
to
please
bring
up
the
tea-kettle
and
*NL*
something
for
their
breakfast
.
This
was
perfunctorily
done
,
and
*NL*
producing
a
couple
of
eggs
which
she
had
brought
with
her
she
put
*NL*
them
into
the
boiling
kettle
,
and
summoned
Jude
to
watch
them
for
the
*NL*
youngsters
,
while
she
went
to
call
them
,
it
being
now
about
half-past
*NL*
eight
o'clock
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
stood
bending
over
the
kettle
,
with
his
watch
in
his
hand
,
*NL*
timing
the
eggs
,
so
that
his
back
was
turned
to
the
little
inner
*NL*
chamber
where
the
children
lay
.
A
shriek
from
Sue
suddenly
caused
*NL*
him
to
start
round
.
He
saw
that
the
door
of
the
room
,
or
rather
*NL*
closet
--
which
had
seemed
to
go
heavily
upon
its
hinges
as
she
pushed
*NL*
it
back
--
was
open
,
and
that
Sue
had
sunk
to
the
floor
just
within
it
.
*NL*
Hastening
forward
to
pick
her
up
he
turned
his
eyes
to
the
little
*NL*
bed
spread
on
the
boards
;
no
children
were
there
.
He
looked
in
*NL*
bewilderment
round
the
room
.
At
the
back
of
the
door
were
fixed
*NL*
two
hooks
for
hanging
garments
,
and
from
these
the
forms
of
the
two
*NL*
youngest
children
were
suspended
,
by
a
piece
of
box-cord
round
each
*NL*
of
their
necks
,
while
from
a
nail
a
few
yards
off
the
body
of
little
*NL*
Jude
was
hanging
in
a
similar
manner
.
An
overturned
chair
was
near
*NL*
the
elder
boy
,
and
his
glazed
eyes
were
slanted
into
the
room
;
but
*NL*
those
of
the
girl
and
the
baby
boy
were
closed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Half-paralyzed
by
the
strange
and
consummate
horror
of
the
scene
,
he
*NL*
let
Sue
lie
,
cut
the
cords
with
his
pocket-knife
and
threw
the
three
*NL*
children
on
the
bed
;
but
the
feel
of
their
bodies
in
the
momentary
*NL*
handling
seemed
to
say
that
they
were
dead
.
He
caught
up
Sue
,
who
*NL*
was
in
fainting
fits
,
and
put
her
on
the
bed
in
the
other
room
,
after
*NL*
which
he
breathlessly
summoned
the
landlady
and
ran
out
for
a
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
got
back
Sue
had
come
to
herself
,
and
the
two
helpless
*NL*
women
,
bending
over
the
children
in
wild
efforts
to
restore
them
,
*NL*
and
the
triplet
of
little
corpses
,
formed
a
sight
which
overthrew
*NL*
his
self-command
.
The
nearest
surgeon
came
in
,
but
,
as
Jude
had
*NL*
inferred
,
his
presence
was
superfluous
.
The
children
were
past
*NL*
saving
,
for
though
their
bodies
were
still
barely
cold
it
was
*NL*
conjectured
that
they
had
been
hanging
more
than
an
hour
.
The
*NL*
probability
held
by
the
parents
later
on
,
when
they
were
able
to
*NL*
reason
on
the
case
,
was
that
the
elder
boy
,
on
waking
,
looked
into
*NL*
the
outer
room
for
Sue
,
and
,
finding
her
absent
,
was
thrown
into
a
*NL*
fit
of
aggravated
despondency
that
the
events
and
information
of
the
*NL*
evening
before
had
induced
in
his
morbid
temperament
.
Moreover
a
*NL*
piece
of
paper
was
found
upon
the
floor
,
on
which
was
written
,
in
*NL*
the
boy
's
hand
,
with
the
bit
of
lead
pencil
that
he
carried
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
_
Done
because
we
are
too
menny
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
At
sight
of
this
Sue
's
nerves
utterly
gave
way
,
an
awful
conviction
*NL*
that
her
discourse
with
the
boy
had
been
the
main
cause
of
the
*NL*
tragedy
,
throwing
her
into
a
convulsive
agony
which
knew
no
*NL*
abatement
.
They
carried
her
away
against
her
wish
to
a
room
on
the
*NL*
lower
floor
;
and
there
she
lay
,
her
slight
figure
shaken
with
her
*NL*
gasps
,
and
her
eyes
staring
at
the
ceiling
,
the
woman
of
the
house
*NL*
vainly
trying
to
soothe
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
could
hear
from
this
chamber
the
people
moving
about
above
,
and
*NL*
she
implored
to
be
allowed
to
go
back
,
and
was
only
kept
from
doing
*NL*
so
by
the
assurance
that
,
if
there
were
any
hope
,
her
presence
might
*NL*
do
harm
,
and
the
reminder
that
it
was
necessary
to
take
care
of
*NL*
herself
lest
she
should
endanger
a
coming
life
.
Her
inquiries
were
*NL*
incessant
,
and
at
last
Jude
came
down
and
told
her
there
was
no
hope
.
*NL*
As
soon
as
she
could
speak
she
informed
him
what
she
had
said
to
the
*NL*
boy
,
and
how
she
thought
herself
the
cause
of
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Jude
.
``
It
was
in
his
nature
to
do
it
.
The
Doctor
says
*NL*
there
are
such
boys
springing
up
amongst
us
--
boys
of
a
sort
unknown
*NL*
in
the
last
generation
--
the
outcome
of
new
views
of
life
.
They
seem
*NL*
to
see
all
its
terrors
before
they
are
old
enough
to
have
staying
*NL*
power
to
resist
them
.
He
says
it
is
the
beginning
of
the
coming
*NL*
universal
wish
not
to
live
.
He
's
an
advanced
man
,
the
Doctor
:
but
*NL*
he
can
give
no
consolation
to
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
had
kept
back
his
own
grief
on
account
of
her
;
but
he
now
*NL*
broke
down
;
and
this
stimulated
Sue
to
efforts
of
sympathy
which
in
*NL*
some
degree
distracted
her
from
her
poignant
self-reproach
.
When
*NL*
everybody
was
gone
,
she
was
allowed
to
see
the
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
's
face
expressed
the
whole
tale
of
their
situation
.
On
*NL*
that
little
shape
had
converged
all
the
inauspiciousness
and
shadow
*NL*
which
had
darkened
the
first
union
of
Jude
,
and
all
the
accidents
,
*NL*
mistakes
,
fears
,
errors
of
the
last
.
He
was
their
nodal
point
,
their
*NL*
focus
,
their
expression
in
a
single
term
.
For
the
rashness
of
those
*NL*
parents
he
had
groaned
,
for
their
ill
assortment
he
had
quaked
,
and
*NL*
for
the
misfortunes
of
these
he
had
died
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
house
was
silent
,
and
they
could
do
nothing
but
await
the
*NL*
coroner
's
inquest
,
a
subdued
,
large
,
low
voice
spread
into
the
air
of
*NL*
the
room
from
behind
the
heavy
walls
at
the
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
said
Sue
,
her
spasmodic
breathing
suspended
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
organ
of
the
college
chapel
.
The
organist
practising
I
suppose
.
*NL*
It
's
the
anthem
from
the
seventy-third
Psalm
;
`
Truly
God
is
loving
*NL*
unto
Israel
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
sobbed
again
.
``
Oh
,
oh
my
babies
!
They
had
done
no
harm
!
Why
*NL*
should
they
have
been
taken
away
,
and
not
I
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
another
stillness
--
broken
at
last
by
two
persons
in
*NL*
conversation
somewhere
without
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
talking
about
us
,
no
doubt
!
''
moaned
Sue
.
''
`
We
are
made
a
*NL*
spectacle
unto
the
world
,
and
to
angels
,
and
to
men
!
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
listened
--
``
No
--
they
are
not
talking
of
us
,
''
he
said
.
``
They
*NL*
are
two
clergymen
of
different
views
,
arguing
about
the
eastward
*NL*
position
.
Good
God
--
the
eastward
position
,
and
all
creation
*NL*
groaning
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
another
silence
,
till
she
was
seized
with
another
uncontrollable
*NL*
fit
of
grief
.
``
There
is
something
external
to
us
which
says
,
`
You
*NL*
sha
n't
!
'
First
it
said
,
`
You
sha
n't
learn
!
'
Then
it
said
,
`
You
*NL*
sha
n't
labour
!
'
Now
it
says
,
`
You
sha
n't
love
!
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
tried
to
soothe
her
by
saying
,
``
That
's
bitter
of
you
,
darling
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
's
true
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
they
waited
,
and
she
went
back
again
to
her
room
.
The
baby
's
*NL*
frock
,
shoes
,
and
socks
,
which
had
been
lying
on
a
chair
at
the
time
*NL*
of
his
death
,
she
would
not
now
have
removed
,
though
Jude
would
fain
*NL*
have
got
them
out
of
her
sight
.
But
whenever
he
touched
them
she
*NL*
implored
him
to
let
them
lie
,
and
burst
out
almost
savagely
at
the
*NL*
woman
of
the
house
when
she
also
attempted
to
put
them
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
dreaded
her
dull
apathetic
silences
almost
more
than
her
*NL*
paroxysms
.
``
Why
do
n't
you
speak
to
me
,
Jude
?
''
she
cried
out
,
after
*NL*
one
of
these
.
``
Do
n't
turn
away
from
me
!
I
ca
n't
BEAR
the
loneliness
*NL*
of
being
out
of
your
looks
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
dear
;
here
I
am
,
''
he
said
,
putting
his
face
close
to
hers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
...
Oh
,
my
comrade
,
our
perfect
union
--
our
two-in-oneness
--
is
*NL*
now
stained
with
blood
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shadowed
by
death

that
's
all

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
;
but
it
was
I
who
incited
him
really
,
though
I
did
n't
know
I
was
*NL*
doing
it
!
I
talked
to
the
child
as
one
should
only
talk
to
people
of
*NL*
mature
age
.
I
said
the
world
was
against

that
it
was
better
to
*NL*
be
out
of
life
than
in
it
at
this
price

and
he
took
it
literally

*NL*
And
I
told
him
I
was
going
to
have
another
child

It
upset
him

Oh
*NL*
how
bitterly
he
upbraided
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
you
do
it

Sue

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't

I
could

bear
deceiving
him
as
to
the
facts

life

And
yet
I
was
n't
*NL*
truthful
,
for
with
a
false
delicacy
I
told
him
too
obscurely
.
--
Why
*NL*
was
I
half-wiser
than
my
fellow-women
?
And
not
entirely
wiser
!
Why
*NL*
did
n't
I
tell
him
pleasant
untruths
,
instead
of
half-realities
?
It
*NL*
was
my
want
of
self-control
,
so
that
I
could
neither
conceal
things
*NL*
nor
reveal
them

*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
plan
might
have
been
a
good
one
for
the

cases

chanced
to
work
badly
perhaps

He
must
have

known
sooner

later

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
was
just
making
my
baby

a
new
frock
;
and
now
I
shall
*NL*
never
see
him
in
it
,
and
never
talk
to
him
any
more

...
My
eyes
are
*NL*
so
swollen
that
I
can
scarcely
see
;
and
yet
little
more
than
a
year
*NL*
ago
I
called
myself
happy

We
went
about
loving
each
other
too
*NL*
much

indulging
ourselves
to
utter
selfishness
with
each

We

said

be
joyful
in
what

instincts

taken
upon
itself
to
thwart

What
dreadful
things
I

said

now
Fate
has
given
us
this
stab
in

being
such

*NL*
*NL*
She
sank
into
a
quiet
contemplation
,
till
she
said
,
``
It
is
best
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
that
they

be
gone

Yes

I
see

Better
that

they
should
be
plucked
fresh
than
stay
to
wither
away
miserably
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

''
replied
Jude
.
``
Some
say
that
the
elders
should
rejoice
when
*NL*
their
children
die
in
infancy

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
they

You
may
say
the
boy
wished
to
be
out
of
life

he
*NL*
would
n't
have
done
it

It
was
not
unreasonable
for

Again
Sue
looked
at
the
hanging
little
frock
and
at
the
socks
and
*NL*
shoes
;
and
her
figure
quivered
like
a
string
.
``
I
am
a
pitiable
*NL*
creature

she
said
,
``
good
neither

I
am
driven
out

*NL*
She
stared
at
Jude
,
and
tightly
held
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
can
be
done
,
''
he
replied
.
``
Things
are
as
they
are
,
and
will
*NL*
be
brought
to
their
destined
issue
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
paused
.
``
Yes
!
Who
said
that
?
''
she
asked
heavily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
comes
in
the
chorus
of
the
_
Agamemnon
_
.
It
has
been
in
my
mind
*NL*
continually
since
this
happened
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
poor
Jude
--
how
you
've
missed
everything
!
--
you
more
than
I
,
for
*NL*
I
did
get
you
!
To
think
you
should
know
that
by
your
unassisted
*NL*
reading
,
and
yet
be
in
poverty
and
despair
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
such
momentary
diversions
her
grief
would
return
in
a
wave
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
jury
duly
came
and
viewed
the
bodies
,
the
inquest
was
held
;
and
*NL*
next
arrived
the
melancholy
morning
of
the
funeral
.
Accounts
in
*NL*
the
newspapers
had
brought
to
the
spot
curious
idlers
,
who
stood
*NL*
apparently
counting
the
window-panes
and
the
stones
of
the
walls
.
*NL*
Doubt
of
the
real
relations
of
the
couple
added
zest
to
their
*NL*
curiosity
.
Sue
had
declared
that
she
would
follow
the
two
little
*NL*
ones
to
the
grave
,
but
at
the
last
moment
she
gave
way
,
and
the
*NL*
coffins
were
quietly
carried
out
of
the
house
while
she
was
lying
*NL*
down
.
Jude
got
into
the
vehicle
,
and
it
drove
away
,
much
to
the
*NL*
relief
of
the
landlord
,
who
now
had
only
Sue
and
her
luggage
*NL*
remaining
on
his
hands
,
which
he
hoped
to
be
also
clear
of
later
on
*NL*
in
the
day
,
and
so
to
have
freed
his
house
from
the
exasperating
*NL*
notoriety
it
had
acquired
during
the
week
through
his
wife
's
unlucky
*NL*
admission
of
these
strangers
.
In
the
afternoon
he
privately
*NL*
consulted
with
the
owner
of
the
house
,
and
they
agreed
that
if
any
*NL*
objection
to
it
arose
from
the
tragedy
which
had
occurred
there
they
*NL*
would
try
to
get
its
number
changed
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Jude
had
seen
the
two
little
boxes
--
one
containing
little
Jude
,
*NL*
and
the
other
the
two
smallest
--
deposited
in
the
earth
he
hastened
*NL*
back
to
Sue
,
who
was
still
in
her
room
,
and
he
therefore
did
not
*NL*
disturb
her
just
then
.
Feeling
anxious
,
however
,
he
went
again
*NL*
about
four
o'clock
.
The
woman
thought
she
was
still
lying
down
,
but
*NL*
returned
to
him
to
say
that
she
was
not
in
her
bedroom
after
all
.
*NL*
Her
hat
and
jacket
,
too
,
were
missing
:
she
had
gone
out
.
Jude
*NL*
hurried
off
to
the
public
house
where
he
was
sleeping
.
She
had
not
*NL*
been
there
.
Then
bethinking
himself
of
possibilities
he
went
along
*NL*
the
road
to
the
cemetery
,
which
he
entered
,
and
crossed
to
where
the
*NL*
interments
had
recently
taken
place
.
The
idlers
who
had
followed
to
*NL*
the
spot
by
reason
of
the
tragedy
were
all
gone
now
.
A
man
with
a
*NL*
shovel
in
his
hands
was
attempting
to
earth
in
the
common
grave
of
*NL*
the
three
children
,
but
his
arm
was
held
back
by
an
expostulating
*NL*
woman
who
stood
in
the
half-filled
hole
.
It
was
Sue
,
whose
coloured
*NL*
clothing
,
which
she
had
never
thought
of
changing
for
the
mourning
he
*NL*
had
bought
,
suggested
to
the
eye
a
deeper
grief
than
the
conventional
*NL*
garb
of
bereavement
could
express
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
filling
them
in
,
and
he
sha
n't
till
I
've
seen
my
little
ones
*NL*
again
!
''
she
cried
wildly
when
she
saw
Jude
.
``
I
want
to
see
them
once
*NL*
more
.
Oh
Jude
--
please
Jude
--
I
want
to
see
them
!
I
did
n't
know
you
*NL*
would
let
them
be
taken
away
while
I
was
asleep
!
You
said
perhaps
I
*NL*
should
see
them
once
more
before
they
were
screwed
down
;
and
then
you
*NL*
did
n't
,
but
took
them
away
!
Oh
Jude
,
you
are
cruel
to
me
too
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
been
wanting
me
to
dig
out
the
grave
again
,
and
let
her
get
*NL*
to
the
coffins
,
''
said
the
man
with
the
spade
.
``
She
ought
to
be
took
*NL*
home
,
by
the
look
o
'
her
.
She
is
hardly
responsible
,
poor
thing
,
*NL*
seemingly
.
Ca
n't
dig
'em
up
again
now
,
ma'am
.
Do
ye
go
home
with
*NL*
your
husband
,
and
take
it
quiet
,
and
thank
God
that
there
'll
be
*NL*
another
soon
to
swage
yer
grief
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Sue
kept
asking
piteously
:
``
Ca
n't
I
see
them
once
more
--
just
*NL*
once
!
Ca
n't
I
?
Only
just
one
little
minute
,
Jude
?
It
would
not
*NL*
take
long
!
And
I
should
be
so
glad
,
Jude
!
I
will
be
so
good
,
and
*NL*
not
disobey
you
ever
any
more
,
Jude
,
if
you
will
let
me
?
I
would
go
*NL*
home
quietly
afterwards
,
and
not
want
to
see
them
any
more
!
Ca
n't
I
?
*NL*
Why
ca
n't
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
she
went
on
.
Jude
was
thrown
into
such
acute
sorrow
that
he
*NL*
almost
felt
he
would
try
to
get
the
man
to
accede
.
But
it
could
*NL*
do
no
good
,
and
might
make
her
still
worse
;
and
he
saw
that
it
*NL*
was
imperative
to
get
her
home
at
once
.
So
he
coaxed
her
,
and
*NL*
whispered
tenderly
,
and
put
his
arm
round
her
to
support
her
;
till
*NL*
she
helplessly
gave
in
,
and
was
induced
to
leave
the
cemetery
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
wished
to
obtain
a
fly
to
take
her
back
in
,
but
economy
being
so
*NL*
imperative
she
deprecated
his
doing
so
,
and
they
walked
along
slowly
,
*NL*
Jude
in
black
crape
,
she
in
brown
and
red
clothing
.
They
were
to
*NL*
have
gone
to
a
new
lodging
that
afternoon
,
but
Jude
saw
that
it
was
*NL*
not
practicable
,
and
in
course
of
time
they
entered
the
now
hated
*NL*
house
.
Sue
was
at
once
got
to
bed
,
and
the
Doctor
sent
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
waited
all
the
evening
downstairs
.
At
a
very
late
hour
the
*NL*
intelligence
was
brought
to
him
that
a
child
had
been
prematurely
*NL*
born
,
and
that
it
,
like
the
others
,
was
a
corpse
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Sue
was
convalescent
,
though
she
had
hoped
for
death
,
and
Jude
had
*NL*
again
obtained
work
at
his
old
trade
.
They
were
in
other
lodgings
*NL*
now
,
in
the
direction
of
Beersheba
,
and
not
far
from
the
Church
of
*NL*
Ceremonies
--
Saint
Silas
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
would
sit
silent
,
more
bodeful
of
the
direct
antagonism
of
*NL*
things
than
of
their
insensate
and
stolid
obstructiveness
.
Vague
*NL*
and
quaint
imaginings
had
haunted
Sue
in
the
days
when
her
intellect
*NL*
scintillated
like
a
star
,
that
the
world
resembled
a
stanza
or
melody
*NL*
composed
in
a
dream
;
it
was
wonderfully
excellent
to
the
half-aroused
*NL*
intelligence
,
but
hopelessly
absurd
at
the
full
waking
;
that
the
*NL*
First
Cause
worked
automatically
like
a
somnambulist
,
and
not
*NL*
reflectively
like
a
sage
;
that
at
the
framing
of
the
terrestrial
*NL*
conditions
there
seemed
never
to
have
been
contemplated
such
*NL*
a
development
of
emotional
perceptiveness
among
the
creatures
*NL*
subject
to
those
conditions
as
that
reached
by
thinking
and
*NL*
educated
humanity
.
But
affliction
makes
opposing
forces
loom
*NL*
anthropomorphous
;
and
those
ideas
were
now
exchanged
for
a
sense
of
*NL*
Jude
and
herself
fleeing
from
a
persecutor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
conform
!
''
she
said
mournfully
.
``
All
the
ancient
wrath
of
*NL*
the
Power
above
us
has
been
vented
upon
us
,
His
poor
creatures
,
and
*NL*
we
must
submit
.
There
is
no
choice
.
We
must
.
It
is
no
use
fighting
*NL*
against
God
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
only
against
man
and
senseless
circumstance
,
''
said
Jude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
!
''
she
murmured
.
``
What
have
I
been
thinking
of
!
I
am
getting
*NL*
as
superstitious
as
a
savage
!
...
But
whoever
or
whatever
our
foe
*NL*
may
be
,
I
am
cowed
into
submission
.
I
have
no
more
fighting
strength
*NL*
left
;
no
more
enterprise
.
I
am
beaten
,
beaten
!
...
`
We
are
made
a
*NL*
spectacle
unto
the
world
,
and
to
angels
,
and
to
men
!
'
I
am
always
*NL*
saying
that
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
feel
the
same
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
shall
we
do
?
You
are
in
work
now
;
but
remember
,
it
may
*NL*
only
be
because
our
history
and
relations
are
not
absolutely
*NL*
known
...
Possibly
,
if
they
knew
our
marriage
had
not
been
formalized
they
*NL*
would
turn
you
out
of
your
job
as
they
did
at
Aldbrickham
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hardly
know
.
Perhaps
they
would
hardly
do
that
.
However
,
I
think
*NL*
that
we
ought
to
make
it
legal
now
--
as
soon
as
you
are
able
to
go
*NL*
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
think
we
ought
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Jude
fell
into
thought
.
``
I
have
seemed
to
myself
lately
,
''
*NL*
he
said
,
``
to
belong
to
that
vast
band
of
men
shunned
by
the
*NL*
virtuous
--
the
men
called
seducers
.
It
amazes
me
when
I
think
of
it
!
*NL*
I
have
not
been
conscious
of
it
,
or
of
any
wrongdoing
towards
you
,
*NL*
whom
I
love
more
than
myself
.
Yet
I
am
one
of
those
men
!
I
wonder
*NL*
if
any
other
of
them
are
the
same
purblind
,
simple
creatures
as
*NL*
I
?
...
Yes
,
Sue
--
that
's
what
I
am
.
I
seduced
you
...
You
were
a
*NL*
distinct
type
--
a
refined
creature
,
intended
by
Nature
to
be
left
*NL*
intact
.
But
I
could
n't
leave
you
alone
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
Jude
!
''
she
said
quickly
.
``
Do
n't
reproach
yourself
with
*NL*
being
what
you
are
not
.
If
anybody
is
to
blame
it
is
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
supported
you
in
your
resolve
to
leave
Phillotson
;
and
without
me
*NL*
perhaps
you
would
n't
have
urged
him
to
let
you
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
have
,
just
the
same
.
As
to
ourselves
,
the
fact
of
our
not
*NL*
having
entered
into
a
legal
contract
is
the
saving
feature
in
our
*NL*
union
.
We
have
thereby
avoided
insulting
,
as
it
were
,
the
solemnity
*NL*
of
our
first
marriages
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Solemnity
?
''
Jude
looked
at
her
with
some
surprise
,
and
grew
*NL*
conscious
that
she
was
not
the
Sue
of
their
earlier
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
said
,
with
a
little
quiver
in
her
words
,
``
I
have
had
*NL*
dreadful
fears
,
a
dreadful
sense
of
my
own
insolence
of
action
.
*NL*
I
have
thought
--
that
I
am
still
his
wife
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Richard
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
God
,
dearest
!
--
why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
I
ca
n't
explain
!
Only
the
thought
comes
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
your
weakness
--
a
sick
fancy
,
without
reason
or
meaning
!
*NL*
Do
n't
let
it
trouble
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sue
sighed
uneasily
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
a
set-off
against
such
discussions
as
these
there
had
come
*NL*
an
improvement
in
their
pecuniary
position
,
which
earlier
in
*NL*
their
experience
would
have
made
them
cheerful
.
Jude
had
quite
*NL*
unexpectedly
found
good
employment
at
his
old
trade
almost
directly
*NL*
he
arrived
,
the
summer
weather
suiting
his
fragile
constitution
;
and
*NL*
outwardly
his
days
went
on
with
that
monotonous
uniformity
which
*NL*
is
in
itself
so
grateful
after
vicissitude
.
People
seemed
to
have
*NL*
forgotten
that
he
had
ever
shown
any
awkward
aberrancies
,
and
he
*NL*
daily
mounted
to
the
parapets
and
copings
of
colleges
he
could
never
*NL*
enter
,
and
renewed
the
crumbling
freestones
of
mullioned
windows
he
*NL*
would
never
look
from
,
as
if
he
had
known
no
wish
to
do
otherwise
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
this
change
in
him
;
that
he
did
not
often
go
to
any
service
*NL*
at
the
churches
now
.
One
thing
troubled
him
more
than
any
other
;
*NL*
that
Sue
and
himself
had
mentally
travelled
in
opposite
directions
*NL*
since
the
tragedy
:
events
which
had
enlarged
his
own
views
of
life
,
*NL*
laws
,
customs
,
and
dogmas
,
had
not
operated
in
the
same
manner
on
*NL*
Sue
's
.
She
was
no
longer
the
same
as
in
the
independent
days
,
when
*NL*
her
intellect
played
like
lambent
lightning
over
conventions
and
*NL*
formalities
which
he
at
that
time
respected
,
though
he
did
not
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
a
particular
Sunday
evening
he
came
in
rather
late
.
She
was
*NL*
not
at
home
,
but
she
soon
returned
,
when
he
found
her
silent
and
*NL*
meditative
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
thinking
of
,
little
woman
?
''
he
asked
curiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
I
ca
n't
tell
clearly
!
I
have
thought
that
we
have
been
selfish
,
*NL*
careless
,
even
impious
,
in
our
courses
,
you
and
I
.
Our
life
has
been
*NL*
a
vain
attempt
at
self-delight
.
But
self-abnegation
is
the
higher
*NL*
road
.
We
should
mortify
the
flesh
--
the
terrible
flesh
--
the
curse
of
*NL*
Adam
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sue
!
''
he
murmured
.
``
What
has
come
over
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
ought
to
be
continually
sacrificing
ourselves
on
the
altar
of
*NL*
duty
!
But
I
have
always
striven
to
do
what
has
pleased
me
.
I
well
*NL*
deserved
the
scourging
I
have
got

I
wish
something
would
take
the
*NL*
evil
right
out
of
me
,
and
all
my
monstrous
errors
,
and
all
my
sinful
*NL*
ways
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sue
--
my
own
too
suffering
dear
!
--
there
's
no
evil
woman
in
you
.
Your
*NL*
natural
instincts
are
perfectly
healthy
;
not
quite
so
impassioned
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
as
I
could
wish
;
but
good
,
and
dear
,
and
pure
.
And
as
I
*NL*
have
often
said
,
you
are
absolutely
the
most
ethereal
,
least
sensual
*NL*
woman
I
ever
knew
to
exist
without
inhuman
sexlessness
.
Why
do
you
*NL*
talk
in
such
a
changed
way
?
We
have
not
been
selfish
,
except
when
no
*NL*
one
could
profit
by
our
being
otherwise
.
You
used
to
say
that
human
*NL*
nature
was
noble
and
long-suffering
,
not
vile
and
corrupt
,
and
at
*NL*
last
I
thought
you
spoke
truly
.
And
now
you
seem
to
take
such
a
much
*NL*
lower
view
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
a
humble
heart
;
and
a
chastened
mind
;
and
I
have
never
had
*NL*
them
yet
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
been
fearless
,
both
as
a
thinker
and
as
a
feeler
,
and
you
*NL*
deserved
more
admiration
than
I
gave
.
I
was
too
full
of
narrow
*NL*
dogmas
at
that
time
to
see
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
say
that
,
Jude
!
I
wish
my
every
fearless
word
and
thought
*NL*
could
be
rooted
out
of
my
history
.
Self-renunciation
--
that
's
*NL*
everything
!
I
can
not
humiliate
myself
too
much
.
I
should
like
to
*NL*
prick
myself
all
over
with
pins
and
bleed
out
the
badness
that
's
in
*NL*
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
!
''
he
said
,
pressing
her
little
face
against
his
breast
as
if
*NL*
she
were
an
infant
.
``
It
is
bereavement
that
has
brought
you
to
this
!
*NL*
Such
remorse
is
not
for
you
,
my
sensitive
plant
,
but
for
the
wicked
*NL*
ones
of
the
earth
--
who
never
feel
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ought
not
to
stay
like
this
,
''
she
murmured
,
when
she
had
remained
*NL*
in
the
position
a
long
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
indulgence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
on
the
same
tack
!
But
is
there
anything
better
on
earth
than
*NL*
that
we
should
love
one
another
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
It
depends
on
the
sort
of
love
;
and
yours
--
ours
--
is
the
*NL*
wrong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
have
it

Come
,
when
do
you
wish
our
marriage
to
be
*NL*
signed
in
a
vestry
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
paused
,
and
looked
up
uneasily
.
``
Never
,
''
she
whispered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
knowing
the
whole
of
her
meaning
he
took
the
objection
serenely
,
*NL*
and
said
nothing
.
Several
minutes
elapsed
,
and
he
thought
she
had
*NL*
fallen
asleep
;
but
he
spoke
softly
,
and
found
that
she
was
wide
awake
*NL*
all
the
time
.
She
sat
upright
and
sighed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
a
strange
,
indescribable
perfume
or
atmosphere
about
you
*NL*
to-night
,
Sue
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
mean
not
only
mentally
,
but
about
your
*NL*
clothes

also

A
sort
of
vegetable
scent

which
I
seem
to
know
,
yet
*NL*
can
not
remember

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
incense

*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

She
stopped
till

control
the
lumpiness
of
her
throat

*NL*
``
From

*NL*
*NL*

Of

many

have
been

with
such
strong
reasons

But
experience
has
proved
how
we
misjudged
ourselves

overrated

No

Why
so

in

perverse

Some
few
days
later
,
in
the
dusk
of
the
summer
evening
,
they
were
*NL*
sitting
in
the
same
small
room
downstairs
,
when
a
knock
came
to
the
*NL*
front
door
of
the
carpenter
's
house
where
they
were
lodging
,
and
in
a
*NL*
few
moments
there
was
a
tap
at
the
door
of
their
room
.
Before
they
*NL*
could
open
it
the
comer
did
so
,
and
a
woman
's
form
appeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Mr.
Fawley
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
and
Sue
started
as
he
mechanically
replied
in
the
affirmative
,
*NL*
for
the
voice
was
Arabella
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
formally
requested
her
to
come
in
,
and
she
sat
down
in
the
window
*NL*
bench
,
where
they
could
distinctly
see
her
outline
against
the
light
;
*NL*
but
no
characteristic
that
enabled
them
to
estimate
her
general
*NL*
aspect
and
air
.
Yet
something
seemed
to
denote
that
she
was
not
*NL*
quite
so
comfortably
circumstanced
,
nor
so
bouncingly
attired
,
as
she
*NL*
had
been
during
Cartlett
's
lifetime
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
three
attempted
an
awkward
conversation
about
the
tragedy
,
of
*NL*
which
Jude
had
felt
it
to
be
his
duty
to
inform
her
immediately
,
*NL*
though
she
had
never
replied
to
his
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
just
come
from
the
cemetery
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
inquired
and
*NL*
found
the
child
's
grave
.
I
could
n't
come
to
the
funeral
--
thank
you
*NL*
for
inviting
me
all
the
same
.
I
read
all
about
it
in
the
papers
,
*NL*
and
I
felt
I
was
n't
wanted
...
No
--
I
could
n't
come
to
the
funeral
,
''
*NL*
repeated
Arabella
,
who
,
seeming
utterly
unable
to
reach
the
ideal
of
*NL*
a
catastrophic
manner
,
fumbled
with
iterations
.
``
But
I
am
glad
I
*NL*
found
the
grave
.
As
't
is
your
trade
,
Jude
,
you
'll
be
able
to
put
up
*NL*
a
handsome
stone
to
'em
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
put
up
a
headstone
,
''
said
Jude
drearily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
my
child
,
and
naturally
I
feel
for
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
so
.
We
all
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
others
that
were
n't
mine
I
did
n't
feel
so
much
for
,
as
was
*NL*
natural
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
sigh
came
from
the
dark
corner
where
Sue
sat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
often
wished
I
had
mine
with
me
,
''
continued
Mrs.
Cartlett
.
*NL*
``
Perhaps
`
twould
n't
have
happened
then
!
But
of
course
I
did
n't
wish
*NL*
to
take
him
away
from
your
wife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
his
wife
,
''
came
from
Sue
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
unexpectedness
of
her
words
struck
Jude
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
beg
your
pardon
,
I
'm
sure
,
''
said
Arabella
.
``
I
thought
you
*NL*
were
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
had
known
from
the
quality
of
Sue
's
tone
that
her
new
and
*NL*
transcendental
views
lurked
in
her
words
;
but
all
except
their
*NL*
obvious
meaning
was
,
naturally
,
missed
by
Arabella
.
The
latter
,
*NL*
after
evincing
that
she
was
struck
by
Sue
's
avowal
,
recovered
*NL*
herself
,
and
went
on
to
talk
with
placid
bluntness
about
``
her
''
boy
,
*NL*
for
whom
,
though
in
his
lifetime
she
had
shown
no
care
at
all
,
*NL*
she
now
exhibited
a
ceremonial
mournfulness
that
was
apparently
*NL*
sustaining
to
the
conscience
.
She
alluded
to
the
past
,
and
in
making
*NL*
some
remark
appealed
again
to
Sue
.
There
was
no
answer
:
Sue
had
*NL*
invisibly
left
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
said
she
was
not
your
wife
?
''
resumed
Arabella
in
another
voice
.
*NL*
``
Why
should
she
do
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
inform
you
,
''
said
Jude
shortly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
,
is
n't
she
?
She
once
told
me
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
criticize
what
she
says

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
--
I
see
!
Well
,
my
time
is
up
.
I
am
staying
here
to-night
,
and
*NL*
thought
I
could
do
no
less
than
call
,
after
our
mutual
affliction
.
*NL*
I
am
sleeping
at
the
place
where
I
used
to
be
barmaid
,
and
to-morrow
*NL*
I
go
back
to
Alfredston
.
Father
is
come
home
again
,
and
I
am
living
*NL*
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
returned
from
Australia
?

said
Jude
with
languid
curiosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
Could
n't
get
on
there

Had
a
rough
time
of
it

Mother
died
*NL*
of
dys
--
what
do
you
call
it
--
in
the
hot
weather
,
and
Father
and
two
*NL*
of
the
young
ones
have
just
got
back
.
He
has
got
a
cottage
near
the
*NL*
old
place
,
and
for
the
present
I
am
keeping
house
for
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
's
former
wife
had
maintained
a
stereotyped
manner
of
strict
good
*NL*
breeding
even
now
that
Sue
was
gone
,
and
limited
her
stay
to
a
number
*NL*
of
minutes
that
should
accord
with
the
highest
respectability
.
When
*NL*
she
had
departed
Jude
,
much
relieved
,
went
to
the
stairs
and
called
*NL*
Sue
--
feeling
anxious
as
to
what
had
become
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
answer
,
and
the
carpenter
who
kept
the
lodgings
said
she
*NL*
had
not
come
in
.
Jude
was
puzzled
,
and
became
quite
alarmed
at
her
*NL*
absence
,
for
the
hour
was
growing
late
.
The
carpenter
called
his
*NL*
wife
,
who
conjectured
that
Sue
might
have
gone
to
St.
Silas
'
church
,
*NL*
as
she
often
went
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
not
at
this
time
o
'
night
?
''
said
Jude
.
``
It
is
shut
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
knows
somebody
who
keeps
the
key
,
and
she
has
it
whenever
she
*NL*
wants
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
long
has
she
been
going
on
with
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
some
few
weeks
,
I
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
went
vaguely
in
the
direction
of
the
church
,
which
he
had
never
*NL*
once
approached
since
he
lived
out
that
way
years
before
,
when
his
*NL*
young
opinions
were
more
mystical
than
they
were
now
.
The
spot
was
*NL*
deserted
,
but
the
door
was
certainly
unfastened
;
he
lifted
the
latch
*NL*
without
noise
,
and
pushing
to
the
door
behind
him
,
stood
absolutely
*NL*
still
inside
.
The
prevalent
silence
seemed
to
contain
a
faint
sound
,
*NL*
explicable
as
a
breathing
,
or
a
sobbing
,
which
came
from
the
other
*NL*
end
of
the
building
.
The
floor-cloth
deadened
his
footsteps
as
he
*NL*
moved
in
that
direction
through
the
obscurity
,
which
was
broken
only
*NL*
by
the
faintest
reflected
night-light
from
without
.
*NL*
*NL*
High
overhead
,
above
the
chancel
steps
,
Jude
could
discern
a
huge
,
*NL*
solidly
constructed
Latin
cross
--
as
large
,
probably
,
as
the
original
*NL*
it
was
designed
to
commemorate
.
It
seemed
to
be
suspended
in
the
*NL*
air
by
invisible
wires
;
it
was

faintly

glimmered
in

ray
caught
from
outside

the

swayed
*NL*
to

in
a
silent
and
scarcely
perceptible
motion

Underneath

*NL*
upon
the
floor

lay
what
appeared
to
be
a
heap
of
black
clothes

*NL*
from
this
was
repeated
the
sobbing

heard
before

his

form

prostrate
on

disclosed
itself

*NL*
``
What

want
with

she
said
almost
sharply

``
You

here

he

in
quick
reproach

for
his
full
heart

was
wounded
to
its
centre
at
this
attitude
of
hers
towards
him

put

Jude

good-night

please
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
n't
stay
?

Not
just
once
more
?
As
it
has
been
so
many

times

O
Sue
,
my
wife
,
why
not
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

no

not

I
am
in

n't
tempt
me
back
*NL*
now
I
have
advanced
so
far
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well

I
do
your
bidding

I
owe
that
to
you
,
darling
,
in
*NL*
penance
for
how
I
overruled
it
at
the
first
time
.
My
God
,
how
*NL*
selfish
I
was
!
Perhaps
--
perhaps
I
spoilt
one
of
the
highest
and
*NL*
purest
loves
that
ever
existed
between
man
and
woman
!
...
Then
let
*NL*
the
veil
of
our
temple
be
rent
in
two
from
this
hour
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
to
the
bed
,
removed
one
of
the
pair
of
pillows
thereon
,
and
*NL*
flung
it
to
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sue
looked
at
him
,
and
bending
over
the
bed-rail
wept
silently
.
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
see
that
it
is
a
matter
of
conscience
with
me
,
and
not
*NL*
of
dislike
to
you
!
''
she
brokenly
murmured
.
``
Dislike
to
you
!
But
I
*NL*
ca
n't
say
any
more
--
it
breaks
my
heart
--
it
will
be
undoing
all
I
*NL*
have
begun
!
Jude
--
good-night
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-night
,
''
he
said
,
and
turned
to
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
but
you
shall
kiss
me
!
''
said
she
,
starting
up
.
``
I
*NL*
ca
n't
--
bear
--
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
clasped
her
,
and
kissed
her
weeping
face
as
he
had
scarcely
ever
*NL*
done
before
,
and
they
remained
in
silence
till
she
said
,
``
Good-bye
,
*NL*
good-bye
!
''
And
then
gently
pressing
him
away
she
got
free
,
trying
to
*NL*
mitigate
the
sadness
by
saying
:
``
We
'll
be
dear
friends
just
the
same
,
*NL*
Jude
,
wo
n't
we
?
And
we
'll
see
each
other
sometimes
--
yes
!
--
and
forget
*NL*
all
this
,
and
try
to
be
as
we
were
long
ago
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
did
not
permit
himself
to
speak
,
but
turned
and
descended
the
*NL*
stairs
.

*NL*
The
man
whom
Sue
,
in
her
mental
_
volte-face
_
,
was
now
regarding
as
*NL*
her
inseparable
husband
,
lived
still
at
Marygreen
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
day
before
the
tragedy
of
the
children
,
Phillotson
had
seen
*NL*
both
her
and
Jude
as
they
stood
in
the
rain
at
Christminster
watching
*NL*
the
procession
to
the
theatre
.
But
he
had
said
nothing
of
it
at
the
*NL*
moment
to
his
companion
Gillingham
,
who
,
being
an
old
friend
,
was
*NL*
staying
with
him
at
the
village
aforesaid
,
and
had
,
indeed
,
suggested
*NL*
the
day
's
trip
to
Christminster
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
thinking
of
?
''
said
Gillingham
,
as
they
went
home
.
``
The
*NL*
university
degree
you
never
obtained
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
''
said
Phillotson
gruffly
.
``
Of
somebody
I
saw
to-day
.
''
In
a
*NL*
moment
he
added
,
``
Susanna
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
saw
her
,
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
said
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
wish
to
draw
your
attention
to
her
.
But
,
as
you
did
see
*NL*
her
,
you
should
have
said
:
`
How
d'ye
do
,
my
dear-that-was
?
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
well
.
I
might
have
.
But
what
do
you
think
of
this
:
I
have
good
*NL*
reason
for
supposing
that
she
was
innocent
when
I
divorced
her
--
that
*NL*
I
was
all
wrong
.
Yes
,
indeed
!
Awkward
,
is
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
taken
care
to
set
you
right
since
,
anyhow
,
apparently
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
H
'm
.
That
's
a
cheap
sneer
.
I
ought
to
have
waited
,
unquestionably
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
end
of
the
week
,
when
Gillingham
had
gone
back
to
his
school
*NL*
near
Shaston
,
Phillotson
,
as
was
his
custom
,
went
to
Alfredston
*NL*
market
;
ruminating
again
on
Arabella
's
intelligence
as
he
walked
down
*NL*
the
long
hill
which
he
had
known
before
Jude
knew
it
,
though
his
*NL*
history
had
not
beaten
so
intensely
upon
its
incline
.
Arrived
in
*NL*
the
town
he
bought
his
usual
weekly
local
paper
;
and
when
he
had
sat
*NL*
down
in
an
inn
to
refresh
himself
for
the
five
miles
'
walk
back
,
he
*NL*
pulled
the
paper
from
his
pocket
and
read
awhile
.
The
account
of
the
*NL*
``
strange
suicide
of
a
stone-mason
's
children
''
met
his
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
Unimpassioned
as
he
was
,
it
impressed
him
painfully
,
and
puzzled
him
*NL*
not
a
little
,
for
he
could
not
understand
the
age
of
the
elder
child
*NL*
being
what
it
was
stated
to
be
.
However
,
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
*NL*
newspaper
report
was
in
some
way
true
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Their
cup
of
sorrow
is
now
full
!
''
he
said
:
and
thought
and
thought
*NL*
of
Sue
,
and
what
she
had
gained
by
leaving
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arabella
having
made
her
home
at
Alfredston
,
and
the
schoolmaster
*NL*
coming
to
market
there
every
Saturday
,
it
was
not
wonderful
that
in
*NL*
a
few
weeks
they
met
again
--
the
precise
time
being
just
after
her
*NL*
return
from
Christminster
,
where
she
had
stayed
much
longer
than
she
*NL*
had
at
first
intended
,
keeping
an
interested
eye
on
Jude
,
though
Jude
*NL*
had
seen
no
more
of
her
.
Phillotson
was
on
his
way
homeward
when
he
*NL*
encountered
Arabella
,
and
she
was
approaching
the
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
like
walking
out
this
way
,
Mrs.
Cartlett
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
just
begun
to
again
,
''
she
replied
.
``
It
is
where
I
lived
*NL*
as
maid
and
wife
,
and
all
the
past
things
of
my
life
that
are
*NL*
interesting
to
my
feelings
are
mixed
up
with
this
road
.
And
they
*NL*
have
been
stirred
up
in
me
too
,
lately
;
for
I
've
been
visiting
at
*NL*
Christminster
.
Yes
;
I
've
seen
Jude
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
How
do
they
bear
their
terrible
affliction
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
a
ve-ry
strange
way
--
ve-ry
strange
!
She
do
n't
live
with
him
any
*NL*
longer
.
I
only
heard
of
it
as
a
certainty
just
before
I
left
;
though
*NL*
I
had
thought
things
were
drifting
that
way
from
their
manner
when
I
*NL*
called
on
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
live
with
her
husband
?
Why
,
I
should
have
thought
`
twould
have
*NL*
united
them
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
not
her
husband
,
after
all
.
She
has
never
really
married
him
*NL*
although
they
have
passed
as
man
and
wife
so
long
.
And
now
,
instead
*NL*
of
this
sad
event
making
'em
hurry
up
,
and
get
the
thing
done
*NL*
legally
,
she
's
took
in
a
queer
religious
way
,
just
as
I
was
in
my
*NL*
affliction
at
losing
Cartlett
,
only
hers
is
of
a
more
`
sterical
sort
*NL*
than
mine
.
And
she
says
,
so
I
was
told
,
that
she
's
your
wife
in
the
*NL*
eye
of
Heaven
and
the
Church
--
yours
only
;
and
ca
n't
be
anybody
else

*NL*
by
any
act
of
man

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

indeed

Separated

they

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see

the
eldest
boy
was
mine

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

yours

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
poor
little
fellow

born
in
lawful
wedlock

thank
God

And
*NL*
perhaps
she
feels
,
over
and
above
other
things
,
that
I
ought
to
have
*NL*
been
in
her
place
.
I
ca
n't
say
.
However
,
as
for
me
,
I
am
soon
off
*NL*
from
here
.
I
've
got
Father
to
look
after
now
,
and
we
ca
n't
live
in
*NL*
such
a
hum-drum
place
as
this
.
I
hope
soon
to
be
in
a
bar
again
at
*NL*
Christminster
,
or
some
other
big
town
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
parted
.
When
Phillotson
had
ascended
the
hill
a
few
steps
he
*NL*
stopped
,
hastened
back
,
and
called
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
,
or
was
,
their
address
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Arabella
gave
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
.
Good
afternoon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Arabella
smiled
grimly
as
she
resumed
her
way
,
and
practised
*NL*
dimple-making
all
along
the
road
from
where
the
pollard
willows
begin
*NL*
to
the
old
almshouses
in
the
first
street
of
the
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
Phillotson
ascended
to
Marygreen
,
and
for
the
first
time
*NL*
during
a
lengthened
period
he
lived
with
a
forward
eye
.
On
crossing
*NL*
under
the
large
trees
of
the
green
to
the
humble
schoolhouse
to
which
*NL*
he
had
been
reduced
he
stood
a
moment
,
and
pictured
Sue
coming
out
of
*NL*
the
door
to
meet
him
.
No
man
had
ever
suffered
more
inconvenience
*NL*
from
his
own
charity
,
Christian
or
heathen
,
than
Phillotson
had
done
*NL*
in
letting
Sue
go
.
He
had
been
knocked
about
from
pillar
to
post
at
*NL*
the
hands
of
the
virtuous
almost
beyond
endurance
;
he
had
been
nearly
*NL*
starved
,
and
was
now
dependent
entirely
upon
the
very
small
stipend
*NL*
from
the
school
of
this
village
-LRB-
where
the
parson
had
got
ill-spoken
*NL*
of
for
befriending
him
-RRB-
.
He
had
often
thought
of
Arabella
's
remarks
*NL*
that
he
should
have
been
more
severe
with
Sue
,
that
her
recalcitrant
*NL*
spirit
would
soon
have
been
broken
.
Yet
such
was
his
obstinate
and
*NL*
illogical
disregard
of
opinion
,
and
of
the
principles
in
which
he
had
*NL*
been
trained
,
that
his
convictions
on
the
rightness
of
his
course
*NL*
with
his
wife
had
not
been
disturbed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Principles
which
could
be
subverted
by
feeling
in
one
direction
were
*NL*
liable
to
the
same
catastrophe
in
another
.
The
instincts
which
had
*NL*
allowed
him
to
give
Sue
her
liberty
now
enabled
him
to
regard
her
*NL*
as
none
the
worse
for
her
life
with
Jude
.
He
wished
for
her
still
,
*NL*
in
his
curious
way
,
if
he
did
not
love
her
,
and
,
apart
from
policy
,
*NL*
soon
felt
that
he
would
be
gratified
to
have
her
again
as
his
,
always
*NL*
provided
that
she
came
willingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
artifice
was
necessary
,
he
had
found
,
for
stemming
the
cold
and
*NL*
inhumane
blast
of
the
world
's
contempt
.
And
here
were
the
materials
*NL*
ready
made
.
By
getting
Sue
back
and
remarrying
her
on
the
*NL*
respectable
plea
of
having
entertained
erroneous
views
of
her
,
and
*NL*
gained
his
divorce
wrongfully
,
he
might
acquire
some
comfort
,
resume
*NL*
his
old
courses
,
perhaps
return
to
the
Shaston
school
,
if
not
even
to
*NL*
the
Church
as
a
licentiate
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
thought
he
would
write
to
Gillingham
to
inquire
his
views
,
and
*NL*
what
he
thought
of
his
,
Phillotson
's
,
sending
a
letter
to
her
.
*NL*
Gillingham
replied
,
naturally
,
that
now
she
was
gone
it
were
best
to
*NL*
let
her
be
,
and
considered
that
if
she
were
anybody
's
wife
she
was
*NL*
the
wife
of
the
man
to
whom
she
had
borne
three
children
and
owed
*NL*
such
tragical
adventures
.
Probably
,
as
his
attachment
to
her
seemed
*NL*
unusually
strong
,
the
singular
pair
would
make
their
union
legal
in
*NL*
course
of
time
,
and
all
would
be
well
,
and
decent
,
and
in
order
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
they
wo
n't
--
Sue
wo
n't
!
''
exclaimed
Phillotson
to
himself
.
*NL*
``
Gillingham
is
so
matter
of
fact
.
She
's
affected
by
Christminster
*NL*
sentiment
and
teaching
.
I
can
see
her
views
on
the
indissolubility
*NL*
of
marriage
well
enough
,
and
I
know
where
she
got
them
.
They
are
not
*NL*
mine
;
but
I
shall
make
use
of
them
to
further
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
wrote
a
brief
reply
to
Gillingham
.
``
I
know
I
am
entirely
wrong
,
*NL*
but
I
do
n't
agree
with
you
.
As
to
her
having
lived
with
and
had
*NL*
three
children
by
him
,
my
feeling
is
-LRB-
though
I
can
advance
no
logical
*NL*
or
moral
defence
of
it
,
on
the
old
lines
-RRB-
that
it
has
done
little
*NL*
more
than
finish
her
education
.
I
shall
write
to
her
,
and
learn
*NL*
whether
what
that
woman
said
is
true
or
no
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
do
this
before
he
had
written
to
his
*NL*
friend
,
there
had
not
been
much
reason
for
writing
to
the
latter
at
*NL*
all
.
However
,
it
was
Phillotson
's
way
to
act
thus
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
accordingly
addressed
a
carefully
considered
epistle
to
Sue
,
and
,
*NL*
knowing
her
emotional
temperament
,
threw
a
Rhadamanthine
strictness
*NL*
into
the
lines
here
and
there
,
carefully
hiding
his
heterodox
*NL*
feelings
,
not
to
frighten
her
.
He
stated
that
,
it
having
come
to
his
*NL*
knowledge
that
her
views
had
considerably
changed
,
he
felt
compelled
*NL*
to
say
that
his
own
,
too
,
were
largely
modified
by
events
subsequent
*NL*
to
their
parting
.
He
would
not
conceal
from
her
that
passionate
*NL*
love
had
little
to
do
with
his
communication
.
It
arose
from
a
wish
*NL*
to
make
their
lives
,
if
not
a
success
,
at
least
no
such
disastrous
*NL*
failure
as
they
threatened
to
become
,
through
his
acting
on
what
*NL*
he
had
considered
at
the
time
a
principle
of
justice
,
charity
,
and
*NL*
reason
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
indulge
one
's
instinctive
and
uncontrolled
sense
of
justice
and
*NL*
right
,
was
not
,
he
had
found
,
permitted
with
impunity
in
an
old
*NL*
civilization
like
ours
.
It
was
necessary
to
act
under
an
acquired
*NL*
and
cultivated
sense
of
the
same
,
if
you
wished
to
enjoy
an
average
*NL*
share
of
comfort
and
honour
;
and
to
let
crude
loving
kindness
take
*NL*
care
of
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
suggested
that
she
should
come
to
him
there
at
Marygreen
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
second
thoughts
he
took
out
the
last
paragraph
but
one
;
and
having
*NL*
rewritten
the
letter
he
dispatched
it
immediately
,
and
in
some
*NL*
excitement
awaited
the
issue
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
days
after
a
figure
moved
through
the
white
fog
which
enveloped
*NL*
the
Beersheba
suburb
of
Christminster
,
towards
the
quarter
in
which
*NL*
Jude
Fawley
had
taken
up
his
lodging
since
his
division
from
Sue
.
A
*NL*
timid
knock
sounded
upon
the
door
of
his
abode
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
evening
--
so
he
was
at
home
;
and
by
a
species
of
divination
he
*NL*
jumped
up
and
rushed
to
the
door
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
come
out
with
me
?
I
would
rather
not
come
in
.
I
want
*NL*
to
--
to
talk
with
you
--
and
to
go
with
you
to
the
cemetery
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
been
in
the
trembling
accents
of
Sue
that
these
words
came
.
*NL*
Jude
put
on
his
hat
.
``
It
is
dreary
for
you
to
be
out
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
``
But
if
you
prefer
not
to
come
in
,
I
do
n't
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
I
do
.
I
shall
not
keep
you
long
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
was
too
much
affected
to
go
on
talking
at
first
;
she
,
too
,
was
*NL*
now
such
a
mere
cluster
of
nerves
that
all
initiatory
power
seemed
*NL*
to
have
left
her
,
and
they
proceeded
through
the
fog
like
Acherontic
*NL*
shades
for
a
long
while
,
without
sound
or
gesture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
tell
you
,
''
she
presently
said
,
her
voice
now
quick
,
now
*NL*
slow
,
``
so
that
you
may
not
hear
of
it
by
chance
.
I
am
going
back
to
*NL*
Richard
.
He
has
--
so
magnanimously
--
agreed
to
forgive
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Going
back
?
How
can
you
go
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
going
to
marry
me
again
.
That
is
for
form
's
sake
,
and
to
*NL*
satisfy
the
world
,
which
does
not
see
things
as
they
are
.
But
of
*NL*
course
I
AM
his
wife
already
.
Nothing
has
changed
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
upon
her
with
an
anguish
that
was
well-nigh
fierce
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
are
MY
wife
!
Yes
,
you
are
.
You
know
it
.
I
have
always
*NL*
regretted
that
feint
of
ours
in
going
away
and
pretending
to
come
*NL*
back
legally
married
,
to
save
appearances
.
I
loved
you
,
and
you
*NL*
loved
me
;
and
we
closed
with
each
other
;
and
that
made
the
marriage
.
*NL*
We
still
love
--
you
as
well
as
I
--
KNOW
it
,
Sue
!
Therefore
our
*NL*
marriage
is
not
cancelled
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
know
how
you
see
it
,
''
she
answered
with
despairing
*NL*
self-suppression
.
``
But
I
am
going
to
marry
him
again
,
as
it
would
*NL*
be
called
by
you
.
Strictly
speaking
you
,
too
--
do
n't
mind
my
saying
*NL*
it
,
Jude
!
--
you
should
take
back
--
Arabella
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
?
Good
God
--
what
next
!
But
how
if
you
and
I
had
married
*NL*
legally
,
as
we
were
on
the
point
of
doing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
have
felt
just
the
same
--
that
ours
was
not
a
marriage
.
*NL*
And
I
would
go
back
to
Richard
without
repeating
the
sacrament
,
if
*NL*
he
asked
me
.
But
`
the
world
and
its
ways
have
a
certain
worth
'
-LRB-
I
*NL*
suppose
-RRB-
,
therefore
I
concede
a
repetition
of
the
ceremony

Do
n't
*NL*
crush
all
the
life
out
of
me
by
satire
and
argument
,
I
implore
you
!
*NL*
I
was
strongest
once
,
I
know
,
and
perhaps
I
treated
you
cruelly

But
Jude

return
good
for
evil
!
I
am
the
weaker
now
.
Do
n't

retaliate
upon
me
,
but
be
kind

Oh
be
kind
to
me
--
a
poor
wicked
*NL*
woman
who
is
trying
to
mend
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
shook
his
head
hopelessly
,
his
eyes
wet
.
The
blow
of
her
*NL*
bereavement
seemed
to
have
destroyed
her
reasoning
faculty
.
The
once
*NL*
keen
vision
was
dimmed
.
``
All
wrong
,
all
wrong
!
''
he
said
huskily
.
*NL*
``
Error

perversity

It
drives
me
out

''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
argued
,
urged
,
implored
;
but
her
conviction
was
proof
against
*NL*
all
.
It
seemed
to
be
the
one
thing
on
earth
on
which
she
was
firm
,
*NL*
and
that
her
firmness
in
this
had
left
her
tottering
in
every
other
*NL*
impulse
and
wish
she
possessed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
considerate
enough
to
let
you
know
the
whole
truth

tell

she
said
in
cut
tones
;

not

slighted

owned
the
extreme
fact
that
I
do
not

did
not

would
be
so
rough
with

for
doing
so

*NL*
*NL*
She
was
so
sadly
sweet
in
what
he
called
her
wrong-headedness
that
*NL*
Jude
could
not
help
being
moved
to
tears
more
than
once
for
pity
of
*NL*
her
.
``
I
never

such
a

penances

you

No

one
expect

go
straight
on

you
double
round

``

I
wanted

you
to
go
to
the
cemetery
with
me

Let
our
farewell
be
there

beside
*NL*
the
graves
of
those
who
died
to
bring
home
to
me
the
error

They
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
place
,
and
the
gate
was
opened
to
*NL*
them
on
application
.
Sue
had
been
there
often
,
and
she
knew
the
way
*NL*
to
the
spot
in
the
dark
.
They
reached
it
,
and
stood
still

*NL*
``
It

The
next
afternoon
the
familiar
Christminster
fog
still
hung
over
all
*NL*
things
.
Sue
's
slim
shape
was
only
just
discernible
going
towards
the
*NL*
station
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
had
no
heart
to
go
to
his
work
that
day
.
Neither
could
he
go
*NL*
anywhere
in
the
direction
by
which
she
would
be
likely
to
pass
.
*NL*
He
went
in
an
opposite
one
,
to
a
dreary
,
strange
,
flat
scene
,
where
*NL*
boughs
dripped
,
and
coughs
and
consumption
lurked
,
and
where
he
had
*NL*
never
been
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sue
's
gone
from
me
--
gone
!
''
he
murmured
miserably
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
in
the
meantime
had
left
by
the
train
,
and
reached
Alfredston
*NL*
Road
,
where
she
entered
the
steam-tram
and
was
conveyed
into
the
*NL*
town
.
It
had
been
her
request
to
Phillotson
that
he
should
not
meet
*NL*
her
.
She
wished
,
she
said
,
to
come
to
him
voluntarily
,
to
his
very
*NL*
house
and
hearthstone
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Friday
evening
,
which
had
been
chosen
because
the
schoolmaster
*NL*
was
disengaged
at
four
o'clock
that
day
till
the
Monday
morning
*NL*
following
.
The
little
car
she
hired
at
the
Bear
to
drive
her
to
*NL*
Marygreen
set
her
down
at
the
end
of
the
lane
,
half
a
mile
from
the
*NL*
village
,
by
her
desire
,
and
preceded
her
to
the
schoolhouse
with
*NL*
such
portion
of
her
luggage
as
she
had
brought
.
On
its
return
she
*NL*
encountered
it
,
and
asked
the
driver
if
he
had
found
the
master
's
*NL*
house
open
.
The
man
informed
her
that
he
had
,
and
that
her
things
*NL*
had
been
taken
in
by
the
schoolmaster
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
now
enter
Marygreen
without
exciting
much
observation
.
*NL*
She
crossed
by
the
well
and
under
the
trees
to
the
pretty
new
school
*NL*
on
the
other
side
,
and
lifted
the
latch
of
the
dwelling
without
*NL*
knocking
.
Phillotson
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
awaiting
her
,
*NL*
as
requested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
come
,
Richard
,
''
said
she
,
looking
pale
and
shaken
,
and
sinking
*NL*
into
a
chair
.
``
I
can
not
believe
--
you
forgive
your
--
wife
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything
,
darling
Susanna
,
''
said
Phillotson
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
started
at
the
endearment
,
though
it
had
been
spoken
advisedly
*NL*
without
fervour
.
Then
she
nerved
herself
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
children
--
are
dead
--
and
it
is
right
that
they
should
be
!
I
am
*NL*
glad
--
almost
.
They
were
sin-begotten
.
They
were
sacrificed
to
teach
*NL*
me
how
to
live
!
Their
death
was
the
first
stage
of
my
purification
.
*NL*
That
's
why
they
have
not
died
in
vain
!
...
You
will
take
me
back
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
so
stirred
by
her
pitiful
words
and
tone
that
he
did
more
than
*NL*
he
had
meant
to
do
.
He
bent
and
kissed
her
cheek
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sue
imperceptibly
shrank
away
,
her
flesh
quivering
under
the
touch
of
*NL*
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
Phillotson
's
heart
sank
,
for
desire
was
renascent
in
him
.
``
You
still
*NL*
have
an
aversion
to
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
dear
--
I
have
been
driving
through
the
damp
,
and
I
was
*NL*
chilly
!
''
she
said
,
with
a
hurried
smile
of
apprehension
.
``
When
are
*NL*
we
going
to
have
the
marriage
?
Soon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To-morrow
morning
,
early

I
thought
--
if
you
really
wish

I
am
*NL*
sending
round
to
the
vicar
to
let
him
know
you
are
come

I
have
told
*NL*
him
all
,
and
he
highly
approves

he
says
it
will
bring
our
lives
to
*NL*
a
triumphant
and
satisfactory
issue

But

are
you
sure

yourself

half-past
eight
to-morrow

My
friend

Gillingham
is
here
to
help

in

ceremony

He

been
good
enough

come
all
the
way
from
Shaston
at
great
inconvenience
to
himself

*NL*
*NL*
Unlike
a
woman
in
ordinary
,
whose
eye
is
so
keen
for
material
things
,
*NL*
Sue
seemed
to
see
nothing
of
the
room
they
were
in
,
or
any
detail
of
*NL*
her
environment
.
But
on
moving
across
the
parlour
to
put
down
her
*NL*
muff
she
uttered
a
little
``
Oh
!
''
and
grew
paler
than
before
.
Her
look
*NL*
was
that
of
the
condemned
criminal
who
catches
sight
of
his
coffin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
said
Phillotson
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
flap
of
the
bureau
chanced
to
be
open
,
and
in
placing
her
muff
*NL*
upon
it
her
eye
had
caught
a
document
which
lay
there
.
``
Oh
--
only
*NL*
a
--
funny
surprise
!
''
she
said
,
trying
to
laugh
away
her
cry
as
she
*NL*
came
back
to
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
Yes
,
''
said
Phillotson
.
``
The
licence
...
It
has
just
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gillingham
now
joined
them
from
his
room
above
,
and
Sue
nervously
*NL*
made
herself
agreeable
to
him
by
talking
on
whatever
she
thought
*NL*
likely
to
interest
him
,
except
herself
,
though
that
interested
him
*NL*
most
of
all
.
She
obediently
ate
some
supper
,
and
prepared
to
leave
*NL*
for
her
lodging
hard
by
.
Phillotson
crossed
the
green
with
her
,
*NL*
bidding
her
good-night
at
Mrs.
Edlin
's
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
woman
accompanied
Sue
to
her
temporary
quarters
,
and
helped
*NL*
her
to
unpack
.
Among
other
things
she
laid
out
a
night-gown
*NL*
tastefully
embroidered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
I
did
n't
know
THAT
was
put
in
!
''
said
Sue
quickly
.
``
I
did
n't
*NL*
mean
it
to
be
.
Here
is
a
different
one
.
''
She
handed
a
new
and
*NL*
absolutely
plain
garment
,
of
coarse
and
unbleached
calico
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
this
is
the
prettiest
,
''
said
Mrs.
Edlin
.
``
That
one
is
no
better
*NL*
than
very
sackcloth
o
'
Scripture
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
I
meant
it
to
be
.
Give
me
the
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
it
,
and
began
rending
it
with
all
her
might
,
the
tears
*NL*
resounding
through
the
house
like
a
screech-owl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
my
dear
,
dear
!
--
whatever
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
adulterous
!
It
signifies
what
I
do
n't
feel
--
I
bought
it
long
*NL*
ago
--
to
please
Jude
.
It
must
be
destroyed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Edlin
lifted
her
hands
,
and
Sue
excitedly
continued
to
tear
the
*NL*
linen
into
strips
,
laying
the
pieces
in
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
med
ha

give
it
to
me
!
''
said
the
widow
.
``
It
do
make
my
heart
*NL*
ache
to
see
such
pretty
open-work
as
that
a-burned
by
the
flames

not
*NL*

ornamental
night-rails

be
much

I.
*NL*
My
days
for
such
be
all
past
and
gone
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
an
accursed
thing
--
it
reminds
me
of
what
I
want
to
forget
!
''
*NL*
Sue
repeated
.
``
It
is
only
fit
for
the
fire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
,
you
be
too
strict
!
What
do
ye
use
such
words
for
,
and
condemn
*NL*
to
hell
your
dear
little
innocent
children
that

lost

Upon
*NL*
my
life
I
do

religion

*NL*
*NL*
Sue
flung
her
face
upon
the
bed
,
sobbing
.
``
Oh
,
do
n't
,
do
n't
!
That
*NL*
kills
me
!
''
She
remained
shaken
with
her
grief
,
and
slipped
down
upon
*NL*
her
knees
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
`
ee
what
--
you
ought
not
to
marry
this
man
again

said
*NL*
Mrs.
Edlin
indignantly
.
``
You

*NL*
*NL*

Yes

just
at

considering
your
reasons

you

lived
on
,
and
made

all
right
at

*NL*
*NL*
``
Richard
says
he
'll
have
me
back
,
and
I
'm
bound
to

If

refused

it
might
not
have
been
so
much
my
duty
to

up
Jude

*NL*
But
--
''
She
remained
with
her
face
in
the
bed-clothes
,
and
Mrs.
Edlin
*NL*
left
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Phillotson
in
the
interval
had
gone
back
to
his
friend
Gillingham
,
*NL*
who
still
sat
over
the
supper-table
.
They
soon
rose
,
and
walked
out
*NL*
on
the
green
to
smoke
awhile
.
A
light
was
burning
in
Sue
's
room
,
a
*NL*
shadow
moving
now
and
then
across
the
blind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gillingham
had
evidently
been
impressed
with
the
indefinable
charm
of
*NL*
Sue
,
and
after
a
silence
he
said
,
``
Well
:
you
've
all
but
got
her
again
*NL*
at
last
.
She
ca
n't
very
well
go
a
second
time
.
The
pear
has
dropped
*NL*
into
your
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
!
...
I
suppose
I
am
right
in
taking
her
at
her
word
.
I
confess
*NL*
there
seems
a
touch
of
selfishness
in
it
.
Apart
from
her
being
what
*NL*
she
is
,
of
course
,
a
luxury
for
a
fogey
like
me
,
it
will
set
me
right
*NL*
in
the
eyes
of
the
clergy
and
orthodox
laity
,
who
have
never
forgiven
*NL*
me
for
letting
her
go
.
So
I
may
get
back
in
some
degree
into
my
old
*NL*
track
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
if
you
've
got
any
sound
reason
for
marrying
her
again
,
do
it
*NL*
now
in
God
's
name
!
I
was
always
against
your
opening
the
cage-door
*NL*
and
letting
the
bird
go
in
such
an
obviously
suicidal
way
.
You
might
*NL*
have
been
a
school
inspector
by
this
time
,
or
a
reverend
,
if
you
*NL*
had
n't
been
so
weak
about
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
myself
irreparable
damage
--
I
know
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Once
you
've
got
her
housed
again
,
stick
to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Phillotson
was
more
evasive
to-night
.
He
did
not
care
to
admit
*NL*
clearly
that
his
taking
Sue
to
him
again
had
at
bottom
nothing
to
*NL*
do
with
repentance
of
letting
her
go
,
but
was
,
primarily
,
a
human
*NL*
instinct
flying
in
the
face
of
custom
and
profession
.
He
said
,
*NL*
``
Yes
--
I
shall
do
that
.
I
know
woman
better
now
.
Whatever
justice
*NL*
there
was
in
releasing
her
,
there
was
little
logic
,
for
one
holding
*NL*
my
views
on
other
subjects
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gillingham
looked
at
him
,
and
wondered
whether
it
would
ever
happen
*NL*
that
the
reactionary
spirit
induced
by
the
world
's
sneers
and
his
own
*NL*
physical
wishes
would
make
Phillotson
more
orthodoxly
cruel
to
her
*NL*
than
he
had
erstwhile
been
informally
and
perversely
kind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
perceive
it
wo
n't
do
to
give
way
to
impulse
,
''
Phillotson
resumed
,
*NL*
feeling
more
and
more
every
minute
the
necessity
of
acting
up
to
his
*NL*
position
.
``
I
flew
in
the
face
of
the
Church
's
teaching
;
but
I
did
it
*NL*
without
malice
prepense
.
Women
are
so
strange
in
their
influence
*NL*
that
they
tempt
you
to
misplaced
kindness
.
However
,
I
know
myself
*NL*
better
now
.
A
little
judicious
severity
,
perhaps
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
you
must
tighten
the
reins
by
degrees
only
.
Do
n't
be
too
*NL*
strenuous
at
first
.
She
'll
come
to
any
terms
in
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
caution
was
unnecessary
,
though
Phillotson
did
not
say
so
.
``
I
*NL*
remember
what
my
vicar
at
Shaston
said
,
when
I
left
after
the
row
*NL*
that
was
made
about
my
agreeing
to
her
elopement
.
`
The
only
thing
*NL*
you
can
do
to
retrieve
your
position
and
hers
is
to
admit
your
error
*NL*
in
not
restraining
her
with
a
wise
and
strong
hand
,
and
to
get
her
*NL*
back
again
if
she
'll
come
,
and
be
firm
in
the
future
.
'
But
I
was
*NL*
so
headstrong
at
that
time
that
I
paid
no
heed
.
And
that
after
the
*NL*
divorce
she
should
have
thought
of
doing
so
I
did
not
dream
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
gate
of
Mrs.
Edlin
's
cottage
clicked
,
and
somebody
began
crossing
*NL*
in
the
direction
of
the
school
.
Phillotson
said
``
Good-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
is
that
Mr.
Phillotson
,
''
said
Mrs.
Edlin
.
``
I
was
going
over
*NL*
to
see

I
've
been
upstairs
with
her
,
helping
her
to
unpack
her
*NL*
things
;
and
upon
my
word
,
sir
,
I
do
n't
think
this
ought
to
be
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
--
the
wedding

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

She

forcing
herself
to
it

poor

little
thing

*NL*
you

no
notion
what
she
's
suffering
.
I
was
never
much
for
religion
*NL*
nor
against
it
,
but
it
ca
n't
be
right
to
let
her
do
this
,
and
you
*NL*
ought
to
persuade
her
out
of
it

Of
course
everybody
will
say
it
was
*NL*
very
good
and
forgiving
of
`

to
take
her
to
`

again

But
for
my
*NL*
part
I
do
n't

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
her
wish

and
I
am
willing

said
Phillotson
with
grave
*NL*
reserve
,
opposition
making
him
illogically
tenacious
now
.
``
A
great
*NL*
piece
of
laxity
will
be
rectified

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
believe
it

She
's
his

She

had
three
*NL*
children
by
him
,
and
he
loves
her
dearly
;
and
it
's
a
wicked
shame
to
*NL*
egg
her
on
to
this

poor
little
quivering
thing

She
's
got
nobody

on

The
one
man
who
'd
be
her
friend

obstinate
creature

wo
n't
allow
to
come
near
her

first
put

I
wonder

*NL*
``
I

's
all
I
have
to

Phillotson
spoke
stiffly
.

You

turned
round

is
unseemly

*NL*

``
No

serious

really

afeard

took
it
*NL*
more
careless

I
do

know
that
we
was
any
the
worse
for
it

When
I

jined
in

we
kept
up
the
junketing
all
*NL*
the
week
,
and
drunk
the
parish
dry
,
and
had
to
borrow
half
a
crown
*NL*
to
begin
housekeeping
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Mrs.
Edlin
had
gone
back
to
her
cottage
Phillotson
spoke
*NL*
moodily
.
``
I
do
n't

whether
I

at
any
rate
quite
*NL*
so
rapidly

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
If
she
is
really
compelling
herself
to
this
against
her
*NL*
instincts

merely
from
this
new
sense
of
duty
or
religion

I
ought
*NL*
perhaps
to
let
her
wait
a
bit
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
you
've
got
so
far
you
ought
not

back
out

my

opinion

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
very
well
put
it
off
now

that
's
true

But
I
had
a
qualm

when
she
gave
that
little
cry
at
sight
of
the
licence

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
never
you
have
qualms

old
boy

I
mean
to
give
her
away

to-morrow
morning

and
you
mean
to
take
her
.
It
has
always
been
on
*NL*
my
conscience
that
I
did
n't
urge
more
objections
to
your
letting
her
*NL*
go
,
and
now
we
've
got
to
this
stage
I
sha
n't
be
content
if
I
do
n't
*NL*
help
you
to
set
the
matter
right

''
*NL*
*NL*
Phillotson
nodded
,
and
seeing
how
staunch
his
friend
was
,
became
*NL*
more
frank
.
``
No
doubt
when
it
gets
known
what
I
've
done
I
shall
*NL*
be
thought
a
soft
fool

But
they
do

know
Sue
as
I
do

*NL*
Though
so
elusive

hers
is
such
an
honest
nature
at
bottom
that
I
*NL*
do
n't
think
she
has
ever
done
anything
against
her
conscience
.
The
*NL*
fact
of
her
having
lived
with
Fawley
goes
for
nothing
.
At
the
time
*NL*
she
left
me
for
him
she
thought
she
was
quite
within
her
right
.
Now
*NL*
she
thinks
otherwise

*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
came
,
and
the
self-sacrifice
of
the
woman
on
the
*NL*
altar
of
what
she
was
pleased
to
call
her
principles
was
acquiesced
*NL*
in
by
these
two
friends
,
each
from
his
own
point
of
view
.
Phillotson
*NL*
went
across
to
the
Widow
Edlin
's
to
fetch
Sue
a
few
minutes
after
*NL*
eight
o'clock
.
The
fog
of
the
previous
day
or
two
on
the
low-lands
*NL*
had
travelled
up
here
by
now
,
and
the
trees
on
the
green
caught
*NL*
armfuls
,
and
turned
them
into
showers
of
big
drops
.
The
bride
was
*NL*
waiting
,
ready
;
bonnet
and
all
on
.
She
had
never
in
her
life
looked
*NL*
so
much
like
the
lily
her
name
connoted
as
she
did
in
that
pallid
*NL*
morning
light
.
Chastened
,
world-weary
,
remorseful
,
the
strain
on
her
*NL*
nerves
had
preyed
upon
her
flesh
and
bones
,
and
she
appeared
smaller
*NL*
in
outline
than
she
had
formerly
done
,
though
Sue
had
not
been
a
*NL*
large
woman
in
her
days
of
rudest
health
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Prompt
,
''
said
the
schoolmaster
,
magnanimously
taking
her
hand
.
*NL*
But
he
checked
his
impulse
to
kiss
her
,
remembering
her
start
of
*NL*
yesterday
,
which
unpleasantly
lingered
in
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gillingham
joined
them
,
and
they
left
the
house
,
Widow
Edlin
*NL*
continuing
steadfast
in
her
refusal
to
assist
in
the
ceremony
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
the
church
?
''
said
Sue
.
She
had
not
lived
there
for
any
*NL*
length
of
time
since
the
old
church
was
pulled
down
,
and
in
her
*NL*
preoccupation
forgot
the
new
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Up
here
,
''
said
Phillotson
;
and
presently
the
tower
loomed
large
and
*NL*
solemn
in
the
fog
.
The
vicar
had
already
crossed
to
the
building
,
*NL*
and
when
they
entered
he
said
pleasantly
:
``
We
almost
want
candles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
--
wish
me
to
be
yours
,
Richard
?
''
gasped
Sue
in
a
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
dear
;
above
all
things
in
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sue
said
no
more
;
and
for
the
second
or
third
time
he
felt
he
was
not
*NL*
quite
following
out
the
humane
instinct
which
had
induced
him
to
let
*NL*
her
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
they
stood
,
five
altogether
:
the
parson
,
the
clerk
,
the
couple
,
*NL*
and
Gillingham
;
and
the
holy
ordinance
was
resolemnized
forthwith
.
*NL*
In
the
nave
of
the
edifice
were
two
or
three
villagers
,
and
when
the
*NL*
clergyman
came
to
the
words
,
``
What
God
hath
joined
,
''
a
woman
's
voice
*NL*
from
among
these
was
heard
to
utter
audibly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
hath
jined
indeed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
like
a
re-enactment
by
the
ghosts
of
their
former
selves
of
*NL*
the
similar
scene
which
had
taken
place
at
Melchester
years
before
.
*NL*
When
the
books
were
signed
the
vicar
congratulated
the
husband
*NL*
and
wife
on
having
performed
a
noble
,
and
righteous
,
and
mutually
*NL*
forgiving
act
.
``
All
's
well
that
ends
well
,
''
he
said
smiling
.
*NL*
``
May
you
long
be
happy
together
,
after
thus
having
been
`
saved
as
by
*NL*
fire
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
came
down
the
nearly
empty
building
,
and
crossed
to
the
*NL*
schoolhouse
.
Gillingham
wanted
to
get
home
that
night
,
and
left
*NL*
early
.
He
,
too
,
congratulated
the
couple
.
``
Now
,
''
he
said
in
parting
*NL*
from
Phillotson
,
who
walked
out
a
little
way
,
``
I
shall
be
able
to
*NL*
tell
the
people
in
your
native
place
a
good
round
tale
;
and
they
'll
*NL*
all
say
`
Well
done
,
'
depend
on
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
schoolmaster
got
back
Sue
was
making
a
pretence
of
doing
*NL*
some
housewifery
as
if
she
lived
there
.
But
she
seemed
timid
at
his
*NL*
approach
,
and
compunction
wrought
on
him
at
sight
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
my
dear
,
I
sha
n't
expect
to
intrude
upon
your
personal
*NL*
privacy
any
more
than
I
did
before
,
''
he
said
gravely
.
``
It
is
for
our
*NL*
good
socially
to
do
this
,
and
that
's
its
justification
,
if
it
was
not
*NL*
my
reason
.
''
Sue
brightened
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
VI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
place
was
the
door
of
Jude
's
lodging
in
the
out-skirts
of
*NL*
Christminster
--
far
from
the
precincts
of
St.
Silas
'
where
he
had
*NL*
formerly
lived
,
which
saddened
him
to
sickness
.
The
rain
was
coming
*NL*
down
.
A
woman
in
shabby
black
stood
on
the
doorstep
talking
to
Jude
,
*NL*
who
held
the
door
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
lonely
,
destitute
,
and
houseless
--
that
's
what
I
am
!
Father
has
*NL*
turned
me
out
of
doors
after
borrowing
every
penny
I
'd
got
,
to
put
it
*NL*
into
his
business
,
and
then
accusing
me
of
laziness
when
I
was
only
*NL*
waiting
for
a
situation
.
I
am
at
the
mercy
of
the
world
!
If
you
*NL*
ca
n't
take
me
and
help
me
,
Jude
,
I
must
go
to
the
workhouse
,
or
to
*NL*
something
worse
.
Only
just
now
two
undergraduates
winked
at
me
as
I
*NL*
came
along
.
'T
is
hard
for
a
woman
to
keep
virtuous
where
there
's
so
*NL*
many
young
men
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
in
the
rain
who
spoke
thus
was
Arabella
,
the
evening
being
*NL*
that
of
the
day
after
Sue
's
remarriage
with
Phillotson
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
for
you
,
but
I
am
only
in
lodgings
,
''
said
Jude
coldly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
turn
me
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
give
you
enough
to
get
food
and
lodging
for
a
few
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
ca
n't
you
have
the
kindness
to
take
me
in
?
I
can
not
endure
*NL*
going
to
a
public
house
to
lodge
;
and
I
am
so
lonely
.
Please
,
Jude
,
*NL*
for
old
times
'
sake
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
''
said
Jude
hastily
.
``
I
do
n't
want
to
be
reminded
of
those
*NL*
things
;
and
if
you
talk
about
them
I
shall
not
help
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
suppose
I
must
go
!
''
said
Arabella
.
She
bent
her
head
against
*NL*
the
doorpost
and
began
sobbing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
house
is
full
,
''
said
Jude
.
``
And
I
have
only
a
little
extra
room
*NL*
to
my
own
--
not
much
more
than
a
closet
--
where
I
keep
my
tools
,
and
*NL*
templates
,
and
the
few
books
I
have
left
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
would
be
a
palace
for
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
bedstead
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
bit
of
a
bed
could
be
made
on
the
floor
.
It
would
be
good
enough
*NL*
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Unable
to
be
harsh
with
her
,
and
not
knowing
what
to
do
,
Jude
called
*NL*
the
man
who
let
the
lodgings
,
and
said
this
was
an
acquaintance
of
*NL*
his
in
great
distress
for
want
of
temporary
shelter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
remember
me
as
barmaid
at
the
Lamb
and
Flag
formerly
?
''
spoke
*NL*
up
Arabella
.
``
My
father
has
insulted
me
this
afternoon
,
and
I
've
*NL*
left
him
,
though
without
a
penny
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
householder
said
he
could
not
recall
her
features
.
``
But
still
,
*NL*
if
you
are
a
friend
of
Mr.
Fawley
's
we
'll
do
what
we
can
for
a
day
*NL*
or
two
--
if
he
'll
make
himself
answerable
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
said
Jude
.
``
She
has
really
taken
me
quite
unawares
;
but
*NL*
I
should
wish
to
help
her
out
of
her
difficulty
.
''
And
an
arrangement
*NL*
was
ultimately
come
to
under
which
a
bed
was
to
be
thrown
down
in
*NL*
Jude
's
lumber-room
,
to
make
it
comfortable
for
Arabella
till
she
*NL*
could
get
out
of
the
strait
she
was
in
--
not
by
her
own
fault
,
as
she
*NL*
declared
--
and
return
to
her
father
's
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
they
were
waiting
for
this
to
be
done
Arabella
said
:
``
You
know
*NL*
the
news
,
I
suppose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
guess
what
you
mean
;
but
I
know
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
a
letter
from
Anny
at
Alfredston
to-day
.
She
had
just
heard
*NL*
that
the
wedding
was
to
be
yesterday
:
but
she
did
n't
know
if
it
had
*NL*
come
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
wish
to
talk
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
:
of
course
you
do
n't
.
Only
it
shows
what
kind
of
woman
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
speak
of
her
I
say
!
She
's
a
fool
!
And
she
's
an
angel
,
too
,
*NL*
poor
dear
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
's
done
,
he
'll
have
a
chance
of
getting
back
to
his
old
*NL*
position
,
by
everybody
's
account
,
so
Anny
says
.
All
his
well-wishers
*NL*
will
be
pleased
,
including
the
bishop
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
spare
me
,
Arabella
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Arabella
was
duly
installed
in
the
little
attic
,
and
at
first
she
*NL*
did
not
come
near
Jude
at
all
.
She
went
to
and
fro
about
her
own
*NL*
business
,
which
,
when
they
met
for
a
moment
on
the
stairs
or
in
the
*NL*
passage
,
she
informed
him
was
that
of
obtaining
another
place
in
*NL*
the
occupation
she
understood
best
.
When
Jude
suggested
London
as
*NL*
affording
the
most
likely
opening
in
the
liquor
trade
,
she
shook
her
*NL*
head
.
``
No
--
the
temptations
are
too
many
,
''
she
said
.
``
Any
humble
*NL*
tavern
in
the
country
before
that
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
Sunday
morning
following
,
when
he
breakfasted
later
than
on
*NL*
other
days
,
she
meekly
asked
him
if
she
might
come
in
to
breakfast
*NL*
with
him
,
as
she
had
broken
her
teapot
,
and
could
not
replace
it
*NL*
immediately
,
the
shops
being
shut
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
if
you
like
,
''
he
said
indifferently
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
they
sat
without
speaking
she
suddenly
observed
:
``
You
seem
all
*NL*
in
a
brood
,
old
man
.
I
'm
sorry
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
all
in
a
brood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
about
her
,
I
know
.
It
's
no
business
of
mine
,
but
I
could
find
*NL*
out
all
about
the
wedding
--
if
it
really
did
take
place
--
if
you
wanted
*NL*
to
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
could
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wanted
to
go
to
Alfredston
to
get
a
few
things
I
left
there
.
And
*NL*
I
could
see
Anny
,
who
'll
be
sure
to
have
heard
all
about
it
,
as
she
*NL*
has
friends
at
Marygreen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
could
not
bear
to
acquiesce
in
this
proposal
;
but
his
suspense
*NL*
pitted
itself
against
his
discretion
,
and
won
in
the
struggle
.
``
You
*NL*
can
ask
about
it
if
you
like
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
've
not
heard
a
sound
from
*NL*
there
.
It
must
have
been
very
private
,
if
--
they
have
married
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
I
have
n't
enough
cash
to
take
me
there
and
back
,
or
I
*NL*
should
have
gone
before
.
I
must
wait
till
I
have
earned
some
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
I
can
pay
the
journey
for
you
,
''
he
said
impatiently
.
And
thus
*NL*
his
suspense
as
to
Sue
's
welfare
,
and
the
possible
marriage
,
moved
*NL*
him
to
dispatch
for
intelligence
the
last
emissary
he
would
have
*NL*
thought
of
choosing
deliberately
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arabella
went
,
Jude
requesting
her
to
be
home
not
later
than
by
*NL*
the
seven
o'clock
train
.
When
she
had
gone
he
said
:
``
Why
should
I
*NL*
have
charged
her
to
be
back
by
a
particular
time
!
She
's
nothing
to
*NL*
me
--
nor
the
other
neither
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
having
finished
work
he
could
not
help
going
to
the
station
to
*NL*
meet
Arabella
,
dragged
thither
by
feverish
haste
to
get
the
news
*NL*
she
might
bring
,
and
know
the
worst
.
Arabella
had
made
dimples
*NL*
most
successfully
all
the
way
home
,
and
when
she
stepped
out
of
the
*NL*
railway
carriage
she
smiled
.
He
merely
said
``
Well
?
''
with
the
very
*NL*
reverse
of
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
married
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
of
course
they
are
!
''
he
returned
.
She
observed
,
however
,
the
*NL*
hard
strain
upon
his
lip
as
he
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anny
says
she
has
heard
from
Belinda
,
her
relation
out
at
Marygreen
,
*NL*
that
it
was
very
sad
,
and
curious
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
mean
sad
?
She
wanted
to
marry
him
again
,
did
n't
she
?
*NL*
And
he
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
that
was
it
.
She
wanted
to
in
one
sense
,
but
not
in
the
*NL*
other
.
Mrs.
Edlin
was
much
upset
by
it
all
,
and
spoke
out
her
mind
*NL*
at
Phillotson
.
But
Sue
was
that
excited
about
it
that
she
burnt
her
*NL*
best
embroidery
that
she
'd
worn
with
you
,
to
blot
you
out
entirely
.
*NL*
Well
--
if
a
woman
feels
like
it
,
she
ought
to
do
it
.
I
commend
her
*NL*
for
it
,
though
others
do
n't
.
''
Arabella
sighed
.
``
She
felt
he
was
her
*NL*
only
husband
,
and
that
she
belonged
to
nobody
else
in
the
sight
of
*NL*
God
A'mighty
while
he
lived
.
Perhaps
another
woman
feels
the
same
*NL*
about
herself
,
too
!
''
Arabella
sighed
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
any
cant
!
''
exclaimed
Jude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
n't
cant
,
''
said
Arabella
.
``
I
feel
exactly
the
same
as
she
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
closed
that
issue
by
remarking
abruptly
:
``
Well
--
now
I
know
all
I
*NL*
wanted
to
know
.
Many
thanks
for
your
information

I
am
not
going
*NL*
back
to
my
lodgings
just
yet
.
''
And
he
left
her
straightway
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
his
misery
and
depression
Jude
walked
to
well-nigh
every
spot
*NL*
in
the
city
that
he
had
visited
with
Sue
;
thence
he
did
not
know
*NL*
whither
,
and
then
thought
of
going
home
to
his
usual
evening
meal
.
*NL*
But
having
all
the
vices
of
his
virtues
,
and
some
to
spare
,
he
turned
*NL*
into
a
public
house
,
for
the
first
time
during
many
months
.
Among
*NL*
the
possible
consequences
of
her
marriage
Sue
had
not
dwelt
on
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arabella
,
meanwhile
,
had
gone
back
.
The
evening
passed
,
and
Jude
*NL*
did
not
return
.
At
half-past
nine
Arabella
herself
went
out
,
first
*NL*
proceeding
to
an
outlying
district
near
the
river
where
her
father
*NL*
lived
,
and
had
opened
a
small
and
precarious
pork-shop
lately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
she
said
to
him
,
``
for
all
your
rowing
me
that
night
,
I
've
*NL*
called
in
,
for
I
have
something
to
tell
you
.
I
think
I
shall
get
*NL*
married
and
settled
again
.
Only
you
must
help
me
:
and
you
can
do
*NL*
no
less
,
after
what
I
've
stood
`
ee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
do
anything
to
get
thee
off
my
hands
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
.
I
am
now
going
to
look
for
my
young
man
.
He
's
on
the
*NL*
loose
I
'm
afraid
,
and
I
must
get
him
home
.
All
I
want
you
to
do
*NL*
to-night
is
not
to
fasten
the
door
,
in
case
I
should
want
to
sleep
*NL*
here
,
and
should
be
late
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
'd
soon
get
tired
of
giving
yourself
airs
and
keeping
*NL*
away
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
do
n't
do
the
door
.
That
's
all
I
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
then
sallied
out
again
,
and
first
hastening
back
to
Jude
's
to
*NL*
make
sure
that
he
had
not
returned
,
began
her
search
for
him
.
A
*NL*
shrewd
guess
as
to
his
probable
course
took
her
straight
to
the
*NL*
tavern
which
Jude
had
formerly
frequented
,
and
where
she
had
been
*NL*
barmaid
for
a
brief
term
.
She
had
no
sooner
opened
the
door
of
the
*NL*
``
Private
Bar
''
than
her
eyes
fell
upon
him
--
sitting
in
the
shade
at
*NL*
the
back
of
the
compartment
,
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
floor
in
a
*NL*
blank
stare
.
He
was
drinking
nothing
stronger
than
ale
just
then
.
*NL*
He
did
not
observe
her
,
and
she
entered
and
sat
beside
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
looked
up
,
and
said
without
surprise
:
``
You
've
come
to
have
*NL*
something
,
Arabella
?
...
I
'm
trying
to
forget
her
:
that
's
all
!
But
*NL*
I
ca
n't
;
and
I
am
going
home
.
''
She
saw
that
he
was
a
little
way
on
*NL*
in
liquor
,
but
only
a
little
as
yet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
come
entirely
to
look
for
you
,
dear
boy
.
You
are
not
well
.
*NL*
Now
you
must
have
something
better
than
that
.
''
Arabella
held
up
her
*NL*
finger
to
the
barmaid
.
``
You
shall
have
a
liqueur
--
that
's
better
fit
*NL*
for
a
man
of
education
than
beer
.
You
shall
have
maraschino
,
or
*NL*
curacao
dry
or
sweet
,
or
cherry
brandy
.
I
'll
treat
you
,
poor
chap
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
care
which
!
Say
cherry
brandy
...
Sue
has
served
me
badly
,
*NL*
very
badly
.
I
did
n't
expect
it
of
Sue
!
I
stuck
to
her
,
and
she
*NL*
ought
to
have
stuck
to
me
.
I
'd
have
sold
my
soul
for
her
sake
,
but
*NL*
she
would
n't
risk
hers
a
jot
for
me
.
To
save
her
own
soul
she
lets
*NL*
mine
go
damn
!
...
But
it
is
n't
her
fault
,
poor
little
girl
--
I
am
*NL*
sure
it
is
n't
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
How
Arabella
had
obtained
money
did
not
appear
,
but
she
ordered
a
*NL*
liqueur
each
,
and
paid
for
them
.
When
they
had
drunk
these
Arabella
*NL*
suggested
another
;
and
Jude
had
the
pleasure
of
being
,
as
it
were
,
*NL*
personally
conducted
through
the
varieties
of
spirituous
delectation
*NL*
by
one
who
knew
the
landmarks
well
.
Arabella
kept
very
considerably
*NL*
in
the
rear
of
Jude
;
but
though
she
only
sipped
where
he
drank
,
she
*NL*
took
as
much
as
she
could
safely
take
without
losing
her
head
--
which
*NL*
was
not
a
little
,
as
the
crimson
upon
her
countenance
showed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
tone
towards
him
to-night
was
uniformly
soothing
and
cajoling
;
*NL*
and
whenever
he
said
``
I
do
n't
care
what
happens
to
me
,
''
a
thing
he
*NL*
did
continually
,
she
replied
,
``
But
I
do
very
much
!
''
The
closing
hour
*NL*
came
,
and
they
were
compelled
to
turn
out
;
whereupon
Arabella
put
her
*NL*
arm
round
his
waist
,
and
guided
his
unsteady
footsteps
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
were
in
the
streets
she
said
:
``
I
do
n't
know
what
our
*NL*
landlord
will
say
to
my
bringing
you
home
in
this
state
.
I
expect
we
*NL*
are
fastened
out
,
so
that
he
'll
have
to
come
down
and
let
us
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
--
I
do
n't
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
worst
of
not
having
a
home
of
your
own
.
I
tell
you
,
*NL*
Jude
,
what
we
had
best
do
.
Come
round
to
my
father
's
--
I
made
it
up
*NL*
with
him
a
bit
to-day
.
I
can
let
you
in
,
and
nobody
will
see
you
at
*NL*
all
;
and
by
to-morrow
morning
you
'll
be
all
right

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anything

anywhere
,
''
replied
Jude
.
``
What
the
devil
does
it
matter
*NL*
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
along
together
,
like
any
other
fuddling
couple
,
her
arm
*NL*
still
round
his
waist
,
and
his
,
at
last
,
round
hers
;
though
with
no
*NL*
amatory
intent
;
but
merely
because
he
was
weary
,
unstable
,
and
in
*NL*
need
of
support
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
--
is
th
'
Martyrs
'
--
burning-place
,
''
he
stammered
as
they
*NL*
dragged
across
a
broad
street
.
``
I
remember
--
in
old
Fuller
's
_
Holy
*NL*
State
_

and
I
am
reminded
of
it

by
our
passing
by
here
--
old
Fuller
*NL*
in
his
_
Holy
State

says
,
that
at
the
burning
of
Ridley

Doctor

preached

took

gone

*NL*
``
Hang

hiccuped
Arabella
.

*NL*
*NL*
They
had
reached
her
father
's
house
,
and
she
softly
unfastened
the
*NL*
door
,
groping
about
for
a
light
within
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
circumstances
were
not
altogether
unlike
those
of
their
entry
*NL*
into
the
cottage
at
Cresscombe
,
such
a
long
time
before
.
Nor
were
*NL*
perhaps
Arabella
's
motives
.
But
Jude
did
not
think
of
that
,
though
*NL*
she
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
find
the
matches
,
dear
,

she
said
when
she
had
fastened
up
*NL*
the
door
.
``
But
never

this
way

As
quiet
as
you
can

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
as
dark
as

said
Jude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give

I
'll

it

She
pulled
off
his
boots

``
Now

she
whispered
,
``
take
hold

``

asked
the
stupefied

VII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Arabella
was
preparing
breakfast
in
the
downstairs
back
room
of
this
*NL*
small
,
recently
hired
tenement
of
her
father
's
.
She
put
her
head
*NL*
into
the
little
pork-shop
in
front
,
and
told
Mr.
Donn
it
was
ready
.
*NL*
Donn
,
endeavouring
to
look
like
a
master
pork-butcher
,
in
a
greasy
*NL*
blue
blouse
,
and
with
a
strap
round
his
waist
from
which
a
steel
*NL*
dangled
,
came
in
promptly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
mind
the
shop
this
morning
,
''
he
said
casually
.
``
I
've
to
*NL*
go
and
get
some
inwards
and
half
a
pig
from
Lumsdon
,
and
to
call

elsewhere
.
If
you
live
here
you
must
put
your
shoulder
to
the
wheel
,
*NL*
at
least
till
I
get
the
business
started
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
for
to-day
I
ca
n't
say

''
She
looked
deedily
into
his
face
.
*NL*
``
I
've
got
a
prize
upstairs

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

What
's
that

A

No

``
Your
old
original
one

Well

I
'm
damned

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

I
always
did
like
him

that
I
will
say

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
does
he
come
to
be
up
there
?
''
said
Donn
,
humour-struck
,
and
*NL*
nodding
to
the
ceiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
ask
inconvenient
questions
,
Father
.
What
we
've
to
do
is
to
*NL*
keep
him
here
till
he
and
I
are
--
as
we
were
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
was
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Married

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
...
Well
it
is
the
rummest
thing
I
ever
heard
of

marrying
an
*NL*
old
husband
again
,
and
so
much
new
blood
in
the
world
!
He
's
no
*NL*
catch

to
my
thinking

I
'd
have
had
a
new
one
while
I
was
about
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
n't
rum
for
a
woman
to
want
her
old
husband
back
for
*NL*
respectability
,
though
for
a
man
to
want
his
old
wife
back
--
well
,
*NL*
perhaps
it
is
funny
,
rather
!
''
And
Arabella
was
suddenly
seized
with
*NL*
a
fit
of
loud
laughter
,
in
which
her
father
joined
more
moderately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
civil
to
him
,
and
I
'll
do
the
rest
,
''
she
said
when
she
had
*NL*
recovered
seriousness
.
``
He
told
me
this
morning
that
his
head
ached
*NL*
fit
to
burst
,
and
he
hardly
seemed
to
know
where
he
was
.
And
no
*NL*
wonder
,
considering
how
he
mixed
his
drink
last
night
.
We
must
keep
*NL*
him
jolly
and
cheerful
here
for
a
day
or
two
,
and
not
let
him
go
back
*NL*
to
his
lodging
.
Whatever
you
advance
I
'll
pay
back
to
you
again
.
*NL*
But
I
must
go
up
and
see
how
he
is
now
,
poor
deary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Arabella
ascended
the
stairs
,
softly
opened
the
door
of
the
first
*NL*
bedroom
,
and
peeped
in
.
Finding
that
her
shorn
Samson
was
asleep
*NL*
she
entered
to
the
bedside
and
stood
regarding
him
.
The
fevered
*NL*
flush
on
his
face
from
the
debauch
of
the
previous
evening
lessened
*NL*
the
fragility
of
his
ordinary
appearance
,
and
his
long
lashes
,
*NL*
dark
brows
,
and
curly
back
hair
and
beard
against
the
white
pillow
*NL*
completed
the
physiognomy
of
one
whom
Arabella
,
as
a
woman
of
rank
*NL*
passions
,
still
felt
it
worth
while
to
recapture
,
highly
important
*NL*
to
recapture
as
a
woman
straitened
both
in
means
and
in
reputation
.
*NL*
Her
ardent
gaze
seemed
to
affect
him
;
his
quick
breathing
became
*NL*
suspended
,
and
he
opened
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
are
you
now
,
dear
?
''
said
she
.
``
It
is
I
--
Arabella
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
--
where
--
oh
yes
,
I
remember
!
You
gave
me
shelter

damn
bad

That
's
what
I
am

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
do
stay
here

There
's
nobody
in
the
house
but
father
and
me
,
*NL*
and
you
can
rest
till
you
are
thoroughly
well

I
'll
tell

the

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
what
they

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
go
round

Perhaps
you

let

up

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

You
'll
find

*NL*
*NL*
Quite
indifferent
,
and
shutting
his
eyes
because
he
could
not
bear
*NL*
the
daylight
in
his
throbbing
eye-balls
,
Jude
seemed
to
doze
again
.
*NL*
Arabella
took
his
purse
,
softly
left
the
room
,
and
putting
on
her
*NL*
outdoor
things
went
off
to
the
lodgings
she
and
he
had
quitted
the
*NL*
evening
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Scarcely
half
an
hour
had
elapsed
ere
she
reappeared
round
the
*NL*
corner
,
walking
beside
a
lad
wheeling
a
truck
on
which
were
piled
all
*NL*
Jude
's
household
possessions
,
and
also
the
few
of
Arabella
's
things
*NL*
which
she
had
taken
to
the
lodging
for
her
short
sojourn
there
.
*NL*
Jude
was
in
such
physical
pain
from
his
unfortunate
break-down
of
*NL*
the
previous
night
,
and
in
such
mental
pain
from
the
loss
of
Sue
and
*NL*
from
having
yielded
in
his
half-somnolent
state
to
Arabella
,
that
*NL*
when
he
saw
his
few
chattels
unpacked
and
standing
before
his
eyes
in
*NL*
this
strange
bedroom
,
intermixed
with
woman
's
apparel
,
he
scarcely
*NL*
considered
how
they
had
come
there
,
or
what
their
coming
signalized
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
Arabella
to
her
father
downstairs
,
``
we
must
keep
plenty
*NL*
of
good
liquor
going
in
the
house
these
next
few
days
.
I
know
his
*NL*
nature
,
and
if
he
once
gets
into
that
fearfully
low
state
that
he
*NL*
does
get
into
sometimes
,
he
'll
never
do
the
honourable
thing
by
me
*NL*
in
this
world
,
and
I
shall
be
left
in
the
lurch
.
He
must
be
kept
*NL*
cheerful
.
He
has
a
little
money
in
the
savings
bank
,
and
he
has
*NL*
given
me
his
purse
to
pay
for
anything
necessary
.
Well
,
that
will
*NL*
be
the
licence
;
for
I
must
have
that
ready
at
hand
,
to
catch
him
*NL*
the
moment
he
's
in
the
humour
.
You
must
pay
for
the
liquor
.
A
few
*NL*
friends
,
and
a
quiet
convivial
party
would
be
the
thing
,
if
we
could
*NL*
get
it
up
.
It
would
advertise
the
shop
,
and
help
me
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
can
be
got
up
easy
enough
by
anybody
who
'll
afford
victuals
and
*NL*
drink
...
Well
yes
--
it
would
advertise
the
shop
--
that
's
true

''
*NL*
*NL*
Three
days
later
,
when
Jude
had
recovered
somewhat
from
the
fearful
*NL*
throbbing
of
his
eyes
and
brain
,
but
was
still
considerably
confused
*NL*
in
his
mind
by
what
had
been
supplied
to
him
by
Arabella
during
*NL*
the
interval
--
to
keep
him
,
jolly
,
as
she
expressed
it
--
the
quiet
*NL*
convivial
gathering
,
suggested
by
her
,
to
wind
Jude
up
to
the
*NL*
striking
point
,
took
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
Donn
had
only
just
opened
his
miserable
little
pork
and
sausage
*NL*
shop
,
which
had
as
yet
scarce
any
customers
;
nevertheless
that
party
*NL*
advertised
it
well
,
and
the
Donns
acquired
a
real
notoriety
among
a
*NL*
certain
class
in
Christminster
who
knew
not
the
colleges
,
nor
their
*NL*
works
,
nor
their
ways
.
Jude
was
asked
if
he
could
suggest
any
guest
*NL*
in
addition
to
those
named
by
Arabella
and
her
father
,
and
in
a
*NL*
saturnine
humour
of
perfect
recklessness
mentioned
Uncle
Joe
,
and
*NL*
Stagg
,
and
the
decayed
auctioneer
,
and
others
whom
he
remembered
as
*NL*
having
been
frequenters
of
the
well-known
tavern
during
his
bout
*NL*
therein
years
before
.
He
also
suggested
Freckles
and
Bower
o
'
Bliss
.
*NL*
Arabella
took
him
at
his
word
so
far
as
the
men
went
,
but
drew
the
*NL*
line
at
the
ladies
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
man
they
knew
,
Tinker
Taylor
,
though
he
lived
in
the
same
*NL*
street
,
was
not
invited
;
but
as
he
went
homeward
from
a
late
job
on
*NL*
the
evening
of
the
party
,
he
had
occasion
to
call
at
the
shop
for
*NL*
trotters
.
There
were
none
in
,
but
he
was
promised
some
the
next
*NL*
morning
.
While
making
his
inquiry
Taylor
glanced
into
the
back
room
,
*NL*
and
saw
the
guests
sitting
round
,
card-playing
,
and
drinking
,
and
*NL*
otherwise
enjoying
themselves
at
Donn
's
expense
.
He
went
home
to
*NL*
bed
,
and
on
his
way
out
next
morning
wondered
how
the
party
went
*NL*
off
.
He
thought
it
hardly
worth
while
to
call
at
the
shop
for
his
*NL*
provisions
at
that
hour
,
Donn
and
his
daughter
being
probably
not
up
,
*NL*
if
they
caroused
late
the
night
before
.
However
,
he
found
in
passing
*NL*
that
the
door
was
open
,
and
he
could
hear
voices
within
,
though
the
*NL*
shutters
of
the
meat-stall
were
not
down
.
He
went
and
tapped
at
the
*NL*
sitting-room
door
,
and
opened
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
to
be
sure
!
''
he
said
,
astonished
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hosts
and
guests
were
sitting
card-playing
,
smoking
,
and
talking
,
*NL*
precisely
as
he
had
left
them
eleven
hours
earlier
;
the
gas
was
*NL*
burning
and
the
curtains
drawn
,
though
it
had
been
broad
daylight
*NL*
for
two
hours
out
of
doors
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
!
''
cried
Arabella
,
laughing
.
``
Here
we
are
,
just
the
same
.
We
*NL*
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
ourselves
,
ought
n't
we
?
But
it
is
a
sort
of
*NL*
housewarming
,
you
see
;
and
our
friends
are
in
no
hurry
.
Come
in
,
Mr.
*NL*
Taylor
,
and
sit
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
tinker
,
or
rather
reduced
ironmonger
,
was
nothing
loath
,
and
*NL*
entered
and
took
a
seat
.
``
I
shall
lose
a
quarter
,
but
never
mind
,
''
*NL*
he
said
.
``
Well
,
really
,
I
could
hardly
believe
my
eyes
when
I
looked
*NL*
in
!
It
seemed
as
if
I
was
flung
back
again
into
last
night
,
all
of
a
*NL*
sudden
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
are
.
Pour
out
for
Mr.
Taylor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
now
perceived
that
she
was
sitting
beside
Jude
,
her
arm
being
*NL*
round
his
waist
.
Jude
,
like
the
rest
of
the
company
,
bore
on
his
*NL*
face
the
signs
of
how
deeply
he
had
been
indulging
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
we
've
been
waiting
for
certain
legal
hours
to
arrive
,
to
*NL*
tell
the
truth
,
''
she
continued
bashfully
,
and
making
her
spirituous
*NL*
crimson
look
as
much
like
a
maiden
blush
as
possible
.
``
Jude
and
I
*NL*
have
decided
to
make
up
matters
between
us
by
tying
the
knot
again
,
*NL*
as
we
find
we
ca
n't
do
without
one
another
after
all
.
So
,
as
a
*NL*
bright
notion
,
we
agreed
to
sit
on
till
it
was
late
enough
,
and
go
*NL*
and
do
it
off-hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
seemed
to
pay
no
great
heed
to
what
she
was
announcing
,
or
*NL*
indeed
to
anything
whatever
.
The
entrance
of
Taylor
infused
fresh
*NL*
spirit
into
the
company
,
and
they
remained
sitting
,
till
Arabella
*NL*
whispered
to
her
father
:
``
Now
we
may
as
well
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
parson
do
n't
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
told
him
last
night
that
we
might
come
between
eight
and
*NL*
nine
,
as
there
were
reasons
of
decency
for
doing
it
as
early
and
*NL*
quiet
as
possible
;
on
account
of
it
being
our
second
marriage
,
which
*NL*
might
make
people
curious
to
look
on
if
they
knew
.
He
highly
*NL*
approved
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
very
well
,
I
'm
ready
,
''
said
her
father
,
getting
up
and
shaking
*NL*
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
old
darling
,
''
she
said
to
Jude
.
``
Come
along
,
as
you
promised
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
did
I
promise
anything
?
''
asked
he
,
whom
she
had
made
so
tipsy
*NL*
by
her
special
knowledge
of
that
line
of
business
as
almost
to
have
*NL*
made
him
sober
again
--
or
to
seem
so
to
those
who
did
not
know
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
!
''
said
Arabella
,
affecting
dismay
.
``
You
've
promised
to
marry
me
*NL*
several
times
as
we
've
sat
here
to-night
.
These
gentlemen
have
heard
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
remember
it
,
''
said
Jude
doggedly
.
``
There
's
only
one
*NL*
woman
--
but
I
wo
n't
mention
her
in
this
Capharnaum
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Arabella
looked
towards
her
father
.
``
Now
,
Mr.
Fawley
be
honourable
,
''
*NL*
said
Donn
.
``
You
and
my
daughter
have
been
living
here
together
these
*NL*
three
or
four
days
,
quite
on
the
understanding
that
you
were
going
to
*NL*
marry
her
.
Of
course
I
should
n't
have
had
such
goings
on
in
my
house
*NL*
if
I
had
n't
understood
that
.
As
a
point
of
honour
you
must
do
it
*NL*
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
say
anything
against
my
honour
!
''
enjoined
Jude
hotly
,
*NL*
standing
up
.
``
I
'd
marry
the
W
--
of
Babylon
rather
than
do
*NL*
anything
dishonourable
!
No
reflection
on
you
,
my
dear
.
It
is
a
*NL*
mere
rhetorical
figure
--
what
they
call
in
the
books
,
hyperbole
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Keep
your
figures
for
your
debts
to
friends
who
shelter
you
,
''
said
*NL*
Donn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
am
bound
in
honour
to
marry
her
--
as
I
suppose
I
am
--
though
*NL*
how
I
came
to
be
here
with
her
I
know
no
more
than
a
dead
man

marry
*NL*
her
I
will
,
so
help
me
God
!
I
have
never
behaved
dishonourably
to
*NL*
a
woman
or
to
any
living
thing
.
I
am
not
a
man
who
wants
to
save
*NL*
himself
at
the
expense
of
the
weaker
among
us
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
--
never
mind
him
,
deary
,
''
said
she
,
putting
her
cheek
against
*NL*
Jude
's
.
``
Come
up
and
wash
your
face
,
and
just
put
yourself
tidy
,
and
*NL*
off
we
'll
go

Make
it
up
with
Father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
shook
hands
.
Jude
went
upstairs
with
her
,
and
soon
came
down
*NL*
looking
tidy
and
calm
.
Arabella
,
too
,
had
hastily
arranged
herself
,
*NL*
and
accompanied
by
Donn
away
they
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
go
,
''
she
said
to
the
guests
at
parting
.
``
I
've
told
the
little
*NL*
maid
to
get
the
breakfast
while
we
are
gone
;
and
when
we
come
back
*NL*
we
'll
all
have
some
.
A
good
strong
cup
of
tea
will
set
everybody
*NL*
right
for
going
home
.

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Arabella
,
Jude
,
and
Donn
had
disappeared
on
their
matrimonial
*NL*
errand
the
assembled
guests
yawned
themselves
wider
awake
,
and
*NL*
discussed
the
situation
with
great
interest
.
Tinker
Taylor
,
being
*NL*
the
most
sober
,
reasoned
the
most
lucidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
wish
to
speak
against
friends
,
''
he
said
.
``
But
it
do
seem
a
*NL*
rare
curiosity
for
a
couple
to
marry
over
again
!
If
they
could
n't
*NL*
get
on
the
first
time
when
their
minds
were
limp
,
they
wo
n't
the
*NL*
second
,
by
my
reckoning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
he
'll
do
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
been
put
upon
his
honour
by
the
woman
,
so
he
med
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
'd
hardly
do
it
straight
off
like
this
.
He
's
got
no
licence
nor
*NL*
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
got
that
,
bless
you
.
Did
n't
you
hear
her
say
so
to
her
*NL*
father
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Tinker
Taylor
,
relighting
his
pipe
at
the
gas-jet
.
*NL*
``
Take
her
all
together
,
limb
by
limb
,
she
's
not
such
a
bad-looking
*NL*
piece
--
particular
by
candlelight
.
To
be
sure
,
halfpence
that
have
*NL*
been
in
circulation
ca
n't
be
expected
to
look
like
new
ones
from
*NL*
the
mint
.
But
for
a
woman
that
's
been
knocking
about
the
four
*NL*
hemispheres
for
some
time
,
she
's
passable
enough
.
A
little
bit
thick
*NL*
in
the
flitch
perhaps
:
but
I
like
a
woman
that
a
puff
o

wind
wo
n't
*NL*
blow
down

''
*NL*
*NL*
Their
eyes
followed
the
movements
of
the
little
girl
as
she
spread
*NL*
the
breakfast-cloth
on
the
table
they
had
been
using
,
without
wiping
*NL*
up
the
slops
of
the
liquor
.
The
curtains
were
undrawn
,
and
the
*NL*
expression
of
the
house
made
to
look
like
morning
.
Some
of
the
*NL*
guests
,
however
,
fell
asleep
in
their
chairs
.
One
or
two
went
to
the
*NL*
door
,
and
gazed
along
the
street
more
than
once
.
Tinker
Taylor
was
*NL*
the
chief
of
these
,
and
after
a
time
he
came
in
with
a
leer
on
his
*NL*
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
Gad
,
they
are
coming
!
I
think
the
deed
's
done
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Uncle
Joe
,
following
him
in
.
``
Take
my
word
,
he
turned
*NL*
rusty
at
the
last
minute
.
They
are
walking
in
a
very
unusual
way
;
*NL*
and
that
's
the
meaning
of
it
!

*NL*
*NL*
They
waited
in
silence
till
the
wedding-party
could
be
heard
entering
*NL*
the
house
.
First
into
the
room
came
Arabella
boisterously
;
and
her
*NL*
face
was
enough
to
show
that
her
strategy
had
succeeded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Fawley
,
I
presume
?
''
said
Tinker
Taylor
with
mock
courtesy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
.
Mrs.
Fawley
again
,
''
replied
Arabella
blandly
,
pulling
*NL*
off
her
glove
and
holding
out
her
left
hand
.
``
There
's
the
padlock
,
*NL*
see
...
Well
,
he
was
a
very
nice
,
gentlemanly
man
indeed
.
I
mean
*NL*
the
clergyman
.
He
said
to
me
as
gentle
as
a
babe
when
all
was
done
:
*NL*
`
Mrs.
Fawley
,
I
congratulate
you
heartily
,
'
he
says
.
`
For
having
*NL*
heard
your
history
,
and
that
of
your
husband
,
I
think
you
have
both
*NL*
done
the
right
and
proper
thing
.
And
for
your
past
errors
as
a
wife
,
*NL*
and
his
as
a
husband
,
I
think
you
ought
now
to
be
forgiven
by
the
*NL*
world
,
as
you
have
forgiven
each
other
,
'
says
he
.
Yes
;
he
was
a
very
*NL*
nice
,
gentlemanly
man
.
`
The
Church
do
n't
recognize
divorce
in
her
*NL*
dogma
,
strictly
speaking
,
'
he
says
:
`
and
bear
in
mind
the
words
of
*NL*
the
service
in
your
goings
out
and
your
comings
in
:
What
God
hath
*NL*
joined
together
let
no
man
put
asunder
.
'
Yes
;
he
was
a
very
nice
,
*NL*
gentlemanly
man
...
But
,
Jude
,
my
dear
,
you
were
enough
to
make
a
cat
*NL*
laugh
!
You
walked
that
straight
,
and
held
yourself
that
steady
,
that
*NL*
one
would
have
thought
you
were
going
`
prentice
to
a
judge
;
though
I
*NL*
knew
you
were
seeing
double
all
the
time
,
from
the
way
you
fumbled
*NL*
with
my
finger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
said
I
'd
do
anything
to
--
save
a
woman
's
honour
,
''
muttered
Jude
.
*NL*
``
And
I
've
done
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
old
deary
,
come
along
and
have
some
breakfast
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
--
some
--
more
whisky
,
''
said
Jude
stolidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
,
dear
.
Not
now
!
There
's
no
more
left
.
The
tea
will
take
*NL*
the
muddle
out
of
our
heads
,
and
we
shall
be
as
fresh
as
larks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
.
I
've
--
married
you
.
She
said
I
ought
to
marry
you
again
,
*NL*
and
I
have
straightway

It
is
true
religion
!
Ha

VIII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Michaelmas
came
and
passed
,
and
Jude
and
his
wife
,
who
had
lived
but
*NL*
a
short
time
in
her
father
's
house
after
their
remarriage
,
were
in
*NL*
lodgings
on
the
top
floor
of
a
dwelling
nearer
to
the
centre
of
the
*NL*
city
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
done
a
few
days
'
work
during
the
two
or
three
months
since
*NL*
the
event
,
but
his
health
had
been
indifferent
,
and
it
was
now
*NL*
precarious
.
He
was
sitting
in
an
arm-chair
before
the
fire
,
and
*NL*
coughed
a
good
deal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
got
a
bargain
for
my
trouble
in
marrying
thee
over
*NL*
again
!
''
Arabella
was
saying
to
him
.
``
I
shall
have
to
keep
`
ee
*NL*
entirely
--
that
's
what
`
twill
come
to
!
I
shall
have
to
make
black-pot
*NL*
and
sausages
,
and
hawk
'em
about
the
street
,
all
to
support
an
*NL*
invalid
husband
I
'd
no
business
to
be
saddled
with
at
all
.
Why
*NL*
did
n't
you
keep
your
health
,
deceiving
one
like
this
?
You
were
well
*NL*
enough
when
the
wedding
was
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
yes
!
''
said
he
,
laughing
acridly
.
``
I
have
been
thinking
of
*NL*
my
foolish
feeling
about
the
pig
you
and
I
killed
during
our
*NL*
first
marriage
.
I
feel
now
that
the
greatest
mercy
that
could
be
*NL*
vouchsafed
to
me
would
be
that
something
should
serve
me
as
I
served
*NL*
that
animal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
sort
of
discourse
that
went
on
between
them
every
day
*NL*
now
.
The
landlord
of
the
lodging
,
who
had
heard
that
they
were
a
*NL*
queer
couple
,
had
doubted
if
they
were
married
at
all
,
especially
*NL*
as
he
had
seen
Arabella
kiss
Jude
one
evening
when
she
had
taken
a
*NL*
little
cordial
;
and
he
was
about
to
give
them
notice
to
quit
,
till
by
*NL*
chance
overhearing
her
one
night
haranguing
Jude
in
rattling
terms
,
*NL*
and
ultimately
flinging
a
shoe
at
his
head
,
he
recognized
the
note
of
*NL*
genuine
wedlock
;
and
concluding
that
they
must
be
respectable
,
said
*NL*
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
did
not
get
any
better
,
and
one
day
he
requested
Arabella
,
with
*NL*
considerable
hesitation
,
to
execute
a
commission
for
him
.
She
asked
*NL*
him
indifferently
what
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
write
to
Sue
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
in
the
name
--
do
you
want
me
to
write
to
her
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
ask
how
she
is
,
and
if
she
'll
come
to
see
me
,
because
I
'm
ill
,
*NL*
and
should
like
to
see
her
--
once
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
like
you
to
insult
a
lawful
wife
by
asking
such
a
thing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
just
in
order
not
to
insult
you
that
I
ask
you
to
do
it
.
You
*NL*
know
I
love
Sue
.
I
do
n't
wish
to
mince
the
matter
--
there
stands
the
*NL*
fact
:
I
love
her
.
I
could
find
a
dozen
ways
of
sending
a
letter
to
*NL*
her
without
your
knowledge
.
But
I
wish
to
be
quite
above-board
with
*NL*
you
,
and
with
her
husband
.
A
message
through
you
asking
her
to
come
*NL*
is
at
least
free
from
any
odour
of
intrigue
.
If
she
retains
any
of
*NL*
her
old
nature
at
all
,
she
'll
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
no
respect
for
marriage
whatever
,
or
its
rights
and
duties
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
DOES
it
matter
what
my
opinions
are
--
a
wretch
like
me
!
Can
*NL*
it
matter
to
anybody
in
the
world
who
comes
to
see
me
for
half
an
*NL*
hour
--
here
with
one
foot
in
the
grave
!
...
Come
,
please
write
,
*NL*
Arabella
!
''
he
pleaded
.
``
Repay
my
candour
by
a
little
generosity
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
NOT
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
just
once
?
--
Oh
do
!
''
He
felt
that
his
physical
weakness
had
*NL*
taken
away
all
his
dignity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
HER
to
know
how
you
are
for
?
She
do
n't
want
to
see
*NL*
`
ee
.
She
's
the
rat
that
forsook
the
sinking
ship
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
,
do
n't
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
stuck
to
un
--
the
more
fool
I
!
Have
that
strumpet
in
the
house
*NL*
indeed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Almost
as
soon
as
the
words
were
spoken
Jude
sprang
from
the
chair
,
*NL*
and
before
Arabella
knew
where
she
was
he
had
her
on
her
back
upon
a
*NL*
little
couch
which
stood
there
,
he
kneeling
above
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
another
word
of
that
sort
,
''
he
whispered
,
``
and
I
'll
kill
*NL*
you
--
here
and
now
!
I
've
everything
to
gain
by
it
--
my
own
death
not
*NL*
being
the
least
part
.
So
do
n't
think
there
's
no
meaning
in
what
I
*NL*
say
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
me
to
do
?
''
gasped
Arabella
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Promise
never
to
speak
of
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
.
I
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
take
your
word
,
''
he
said
scornfully
as
he
loosened
her
.
``
But
what
*NL*
it
is
worth
I
ca
n't
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
could
n't
kill
the
pig
,
but
you
could
kill
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
--
there
you
have
me
!
No
--
I
could
n't
kill
you
--
even
in
a
passion
.
*NL*
Taunt
away
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
then
began
coughing
very
much
,
and
she
estimated
his
life
with
an
*NL*
appraiser
's
eye
as
he
sank
back
ghastly
pale
.
``
I
'll
send
for
her
,
''
*NL*
Arabella
murmured
,
``
if
you
'll
agree
to
my
being
in
the
room
with
you
*NL*
all
the
time
she
's
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
softer
side
of
his
nature
,
the
desire
to
see
Sue
,
made
him
unable
*NL*
to
resist
the
offer
even
now
,
provoked
as
he
had
been
;
and
he
replied
*NL*
breathlessly
:
``
Yes
,
I
agree
.
Only
send
for
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
he
inquired
if
she
had
written
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
said
;
``
I
wrote
a
note
telling
her
you
were
ill
,
and
asking
*NL*
her
to
come
to-morrow
or
the
day
after
.
I
have
n't
posted
it
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
Jude
wondered
if
she
really
did
post
it
,
but
would
not
*NL*
ask
her
;
and
foolish
Hope
,
that
lives
on
a
drop
and
a
crumb
,
made
him
*NL*
restless
with
expectation
.
He
knew
the
times
of
the
possible
trains
,
*NL*
and
listened
on
each
occasion
for
sounds
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
come
;
but
Jude
would
not
address
Arabella
again
thereon
.
*NL*
He
hoped
and
expected
all
the
next
day
;
but
no
Sue
appeared
;
neither
*NL*
was
there
any
note
of
reply
.
Then
Jude
decided
in
the
privacy
of
his
*NL*
mind
that
Arabella
had
never
posted
hers
,
although
she
had
written
*NL*
it
.
There
was
something
in
her
manner
which
told
it
.
His
physical
*NL*
weakness
was
such
that
he
shed
tears
at
the
disappointment
when
she
*NL*
was
not
there
to
see
.
His
suspicions
were
,
in
fact
,
well
founded
.
*NL*
Arabella
,
like
some
other
nurses
,
thought
that
your
duty
towards
your
*NL*
invalid
was
to
pacify
him
by
any
means
short
of
really
acting
upon
*NL*
his
fancies
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
never
said
another
word
to
her
about
his
wish
or
his
conjecture
.
*NL*
A
silent
,
undiscerned
resolve
grew
up
in
him
,
which
gave
him
,
if
not
*NL*
strength
,
stability
and
calm
.
One
midday
when
,
after
an
absence
of
*NL*
two
hours
,
she
came
into
the
room
,
she
beheld
the
chair
empty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Down
she
flopped
on
the
bed
,
and
sitting
,
meditated
.
``
Now
where
the
*NL*
devil
is
my
man
gone
to
!
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
driving
rain
from
the
north-east
had
been
falling
with
more
or
less
*NL*
intermission
all
the
morning
,
and
looking
from
the
window
at
the
*NL*
dripping
spouts
it
seemed
impossible
to
believe
that
any
sick
man
*NL*
would
have
ventured
out
to
almost
certain
death
.
Yet
a
conviction
*NL*
possessed
Arabella
that
he
had
gone
out
,
and
it
became
a
certainty
*NL*
when
she
had
searched
the
house
.
``
If
he
's
such
a
fool
,
let
him
be
!
''
*NL*
she
said
.
``
I
can
do
no
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
was
at
that
moment
in
a
railway
train
that
was
drawing
near
to
*NL*
Alfredston
,
oddly
swathed
,
pale
as
a
monumental
figure
in
alabaster
,
*NL*
and
much
stared
at
by
other
passengers
.
An
hour
later
his
thin
form
,
*NL*
in
the
long
great-coat
and
blanket
he
had
come
with
,
but
without
an
*NL*
umbrella
,
could
have
been
seen
walking
along
the
five-mile
road
to
*NL*
Marygreen
.
On
his
face
showed
the
determined
purpose
that
alone
*NL*
sustained
him
,
but
to
which
has
weakness
afforded
a
sorry
foundation
.
*NL*
By
the
up-hill
walk
he
was
quite
blown
,
but
he
pressed
on
;
and
at
*NL*
half-past
three
o'clock
stood
by
the
familiar
well
at
Marygreen
.
*NL*
The
rain
was
keeping
everybody
indoors
;
Jude
crossed
the
green
to
the
*NL*
church
without
observation
,
and
found
the
building
open
.
Here
he
*NL*
stood
,
looking
forth
at
the
school
,
whence
he
could
hear
the
usual
*NL*
sing-song
tones
of
the
little
voices
that
had
not
learnt
Creation
's
*NL*
groan
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
waited
till
a
small
boy
came
from
the
school
--
one
evidently
*NL*
allowed
out
before
hours
for
some
reason
or
other
.
Jude
held
up
his
*NL*
hand
,
and
the
child
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
call
at
the
schoolhouse
and
ask
Mrs.
Phillotson
if
she
will
*NL*
be
kind
enough
to
come
to
the
church
for
a
few
minutes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
departed
,
and
Jude
heard
him
knock
at
the
door
of
the
*NL*
dwelling
.
He
himself
went
further
into
the
church
.
Everything
*NL*
was
new
,
except
a
few
pieces
of
carving
preserved
from
the
wrecked
*NL*
old
fabric
,
now
fixed
against
the
new
walls
.
He
stood
by
these
:
*NL*
they
seemed
akin
to
the
perished
people
of
that
place
who
were
his
*NL*
ancestors
and
Sue
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
light
footstep
,
which
might
have
been
accounted
no
more
than
an
*NL*
added
drip
to
the
rainfall
,
sounded
in
the
porch
,
and
he
looked
*NL*
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
I
did
n't
think
it
was
you
!
I
did
n't
--
Oh
,
Jude
!
''
A
hysterical
*NL*
catch
in
her
breath
ended
in
a
succession
of
them
.
He
advanced
,
but
*NL*
she
quickly
recovered
and
went
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
go
--
do
n't
go
!
''
he
implored
.
``
This
is
my
last
time
!
I
thought
*NL*
it
would
be
less
intrusive
than

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
ran
up
the
church
to
the
east
end
,
and
Jude
did
as
she
requested
.
*NL*
He
did
not
turn
his
head
,
but
took
up
his
blanket
,
which
she
had
not
*NL*
seen
,
and
went
straight
out
.
As
he
passed
the
end
of
the
church
she
*NL*
heard
his
coughs
mingling
with
the
rain
on
the
windows
,
and
in
a
last
*NL*
instinct
of
human
affection
,
even
now
unsubdued
by
her
fetters
,
she
*NL*
sprang
up
as
if
to
go
and
succour
him
.
But
she
knelt
down
again
,
and
*NL*
stopped
her
ears
with
her
hands
till
all
possible
sound
of
him
had
*NL*
passed
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
by
this
time
at
the
corner
of
the
green
,
from
which
the
path
*NL*
ran
across
the
fields
in
which
he
had
scared
rooks
as
a
boy
.
He
*NL*
turned
and
looked
back
,
once
,
at
the
building
which
still
contained
*NL*
Sue
;
and
then
went
on
,
knowing
that
his
eyes
would
light
on
that
*NL*
scene
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
cold
spots
up
and
down
Wessex
in
autumn
and
winter
weather
;
*NL*
but
the
coldest
of
all
when
a
north
or
east
wind
is
blowing
is
the
*NL*
crest
of
the
down
by
the
Brown
House
,
where
the
road
to
Alfredston
*NL*
crosses
the
old
Ridgeway
.
Here
the
first
winter
sleets
and
snows
*NL*
fall
and
lie
,
and
here
the
spring
frost
lingers
last
unthawed
.
Here
*NL*
in
the
teeth
of
the
north-east
wind
and
rain
Jude
now
pursued
his
*NL*
way
,
wet
through
,
the
necessary
slowness
of
his
walk
from
lack
of
his
*NL*
former
strength
being
insufficent
to
maintain
his
heat
.
He
came
to
*NL*
the
milestone
,
and
,
raining
as
it
was
,
spread
his
blanket
and
lay
*NL*
down
there
to
rest
.
Before
moving
on
he
went
and
felt
at
the
back
*NL*
of
the
stone
for
his
own
carving
.
It
was
still
there
;
but
nearly
*NL*
obliterated
by
moss
.
He
passed
the
spot
where
the
gibbet
of
his
*NL*
ancestor
and
Sue
's
had
stood
,
and
descended
the
hill
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
dark
when
he
reached
Alfredston
,
where
he
had
a
cup
of
tea
,
*NL*
the
deadly
chill
that
began
to
creep
into
his
bones
being
too
much
*NL*
for
him
to
endure
fasting
.
To
get
home
he
had
to
travel
by
a
steam
*NL*
tram-car
,
and
two
branches
of
railway
,
with
much
waiting
at
a
*NL*
junction
.
He
did
not
reach
Christminster
till
ten
o'clock
.

On
the
platform
stood
Arabella
.
She
looked
him
up
and
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
been
to
see
her

she
asked
.

tottering
with

lassitude

``

The
water
ran
out
of
him
as
he
went
,
and
he
was
compelled
to
lean
*NL*
against
the
wall
to
support
himself
while
coughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
done

said

taking

As
Antigone
said
,
I
am
neither
a
dweller
among
men
nor
*NL*
ghosts

But
,
Arabella
,
when
I
am
dead

you
'll
see
my
spirit
flitting
*NL*
up
and
down
here
among

*NL*
*NL*
``
Pooh

You

It
was
night
at
Marygreen
,
and
the
rain
of
the
afternoon
showed
no
*NL*
sign
of
abatement
.
About
the
time
at
which
Jude
and
Arabella
were
*NL*
walking
the
streets
of
Christminster
homeward
,
the
Widow
Edlin
*NL*
crossed
the
green
,
and
opened
the
back
door
of
the
schoolmaster
's
*NL*
dwelling
,
which
she
often
did
now
before
bedtime
,
to
assist
Sue
in
*NL*
putting
things
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sue
was
muddling
helplessly
in
the
kitchen
,
for
she
was
not
a
good
*NL*
housewife
,
though
she
tried
to
be
,
and
grew
impatient
of
domestic
*NL*
details
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
love

*NL*

No

the

eight
o'clock

Why

trouble
him
about

I
am
going

doing

I

*NL*
*NL*

Yes

will
be
terrible

I
so
unheroic

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it

asked
Mrs.

curiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not

something

I
can

The
mournful

that
nobody
would
admit
it

a
reason

feeling

so
that
no

is
left

*NL*
*NL*
``
Did

*NL*
``
Never

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
heard
strange
tales

observed
the
widow
*NL*
in
a
lowered
voice
.
``
They
say
that
when

devils
used

take

,
and
get
poor

women
into
all
sorts
of
trouble

But
I
do
n't
know
why
that
should
*NL*
come
into
my
head

for
it
is
only
a
tale

What
a
wind
and
rain
it
*NL*
is
to-night
!
Well

do
n't
be
in
a

to
alter
things

*NL*
Think
it
over

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

no

I
've
screwed
my

soul
up
to
treating

courteously

it
must
be
now

at
once

before
I
break
down

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do

*NL*
*NL*

It

*NL*
*NL*
Half
an
hour
later
when
Mrs.
Edlin
put
on
her
bonnet
and
shawl
to
*NL*
leave
,
Sue
seemed
to
be
seized
with
vague
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

no

do
n't
go
,
Mrs.
Edlin

she
implored
,
her
eyes
enlarged
,
and
*NL*
with
a
quick
nervous
look
over
her
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
is
bedtime

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

morning

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

Nothing

old
walls
,
whether
I
be
there
or
no

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
then
fastened
up
the
doors
,
and
they
ascended
the
stairs
*NL*
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
here
,
Mrs.
Edlin

said
Sue
.
``
I
'll
go
into
my
old
room
a
*NL*
moment
by
myself

''
*NL*
*NL*
Leaving
the
widow
on
the
landing
Sue
turned
to
the
chamber
which
had
*NL*
been
hers
exclusively
since
her
arrival
at
Marygreen
,
and
pushing
to
*NL*
the
door
knelt
down
by
the
bed
for
a
minute
or
two
.
She
then
arose
,
*NL*
and
taking
her
night-gown
from
the
pillow
undressed
and
came
out
to
*NL*
Mrs.
Edlin
.
A
man
could
be
heard
snoring
in
the
room
opposite
.
She
*NL*
wished
Mrs.
Edlin
good-night
,
and
the
widow
entered
the
room
that
Sue
*NL*
had
just
vacated
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sue
unlatched
the
other
chamber
door
,
and
,
as
if
seized
with
*NL*
faintness
,
sank
down
outside
it
.
Getting
up
again
she
half
opened
*NL*
the
door
,
and
said
``
Richard
.
''
As
the
word
came
out
of
her
mouth
she
*NL*
visibly
shuddered
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
snoring
had
quite
ceased
for
some
time
,
but
he
did
not
reply
.
*NL*
Sue
seemed
relieved
,
and
hurried
back
to
Mrs.
Edlin
's
chamber
.
``
Are
*NL*
you
in
bed
,
Mrs.
Edlin
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
dear
,
''
said
the
widow
,
opening
the
door
.
``
I
be
old
and
slow
,
*NL*
and
it
takes
me
a
long
while
to
un-ray

I

unlaced
my
jumps
*NL*
yet

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

do

And
perhaps

perhaps

*NL*
*NL*
``
What

child
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
he
's
dead

she
gasped
.
``
And
then
--
I
should
be
FREE
,
and
I
*NL*
could
go
to
Jude

Ah

no

I
forgot
HER

and
God
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
go
and
hearken
.
No
--
he
's
snoring
again
.
But
the
rain
and
the
*NL*
wind
is
so
loud
that
you
can
hardly
hear
anything
but
between
*NL*
whiles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sue
had
dragged
herself
back
.
``
Mrs.
Edlin
,
good-night
again
!
I
am
*NL*
sorry
I
called
you
out
.
''
The
widow
retreated
a
second
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
strained
,
resigned
look
returned
to
Sue
's
face
when
she
was
*NL*
alone
.
``
I
must
do
it
--
I
must
!
I
must
drink
to
the
dregs
!
''
she
*NL*
whispered
.
``
Richard
!
''
she
said
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hey

what
?
Is
that
you

Susanna

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want

Anything
the
matter

Wait
a
moment

He
pulled
*NL*
on
some
articles
of
clothing
,
and
came
to
the
door
.
``
Yes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
we
were
at
Shaston
I
jumped
out
of
the
window
rather
than

come
near

.
I
have
never
reversed
that
treatment
till
*NL*
now

when
I
have
come
to
beg
your
pardon
for
it

ask
you
to
let

me
in

*NL*
``

*NL*

waited
a
moment

repeated

be
admitted

this
afternoon

``

the

*NL*
``
Come

Anything
else

confess

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

She
had
been
intending
to
say
:
``
I
called
him
my
darling
Love

''
*NL*
But
,
as
a
contrite
woman
always
keeps
back
a
little
,
that
portion
of
*NL*
the
scene
remained
untold
.
She
went
on
:
``
I
am
never
going
to
see
him

any
more

He
spoke
of
some
things
of
the
past

it
overcame
me

He
spoke
of

the
children

,
as
I
have
said

I
am
glad

almost

glad
I
mean

``
Well

not
seeing

again
any
more

really

this

There
was
something
in
Phillotson
's
tone
now
which
seemed
to
*NL*
show
that
his
three
months
of
remarriage
with
Sue
had
somehow
not
*NL*
been
so
satisfactory
as
his
magnanimity
or
amative
patience
had
*NL*
anticipated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

yes

it

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

*NL*
*NL*
He
went
back
to
the
room
and
brought
out
a
little
brown
Testament
.
*NL*
``
Now
then
:
So
help
you
God

She
swore

``
Very

about

He
gloomily
considered
her
thin
and
fragile

form
a
moment
longer
as
she
crouched
before
him
in
her
night-clothes
.
*NL*
``
Well

I
thought
it
might
end
like
this

he
said
presently
.
``
I
owe

you
nothing

I
'll
take

in
at

*NL*
and
forgive
you

*NL*
*NL*
He
put
his
arm
round
her
to
lift
her
up
.
Sue
started
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter

he
asked
,
speaking
for
the
first
time
sternly
.
*NL*
``
You

from
me
again

just
as

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

Placing
the
candlestick
on
the
chest
of
drawers
he
led
her
through
*NL*
the
doorway
,
and
lifting
her
bodily
,
kissed
her
.
A
quick
look
of
*NL*
aversion
passed
over
her
face
,
but
clenching
her
teeth
she
uttered
*NL*
no
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Edlin
had
by
this
time
undressed
,
and
was
about
to
get
into
bed
*NL*
when
she
said
to
herself
:
``
Ah
--
perhaps
I
'd
better
go
and
see
if
the
*NL*
little
thing
is
all
right
.
How
it
do
blow
and
rain
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
widow
went
out
on
the
landing
,
and
saw
that
Sue
had
disappeared
.
``
Ah
!
*NL*
Poor
soul
!
Weddings
be
funerals
'
a
b
`
lieve
nowadays
.
Fifty-five
*NL*
years
ago
,
come
Fall
,
since
my
man
and
I
married
!
Times
have
changed
*NL*
since
then
!

Despite
himself
Jude
recovered
somewhat
,
and
worked
at
his
trade
for
*NL*
several
weeks
.
After
Christmas
,
however
,
he
broke
down
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
money
he
had
earned
he
shifted
his
lodgings
to
a
yet
more
*NL*
central
part
of
the
town
.
But
Arabella
saw
that
he
was
not
likely
*NL*
to
do
much
work
for
a
long
while
,
and
was
cross
enough
at
the
turn
*NL*
affairs
had
taken
since
her
remarriage
to
him
.
``
I
'm
hanged
if
you
*NL*
have
n't
been
clever
in
this
last
stroke
!
''
she
would
say
,
``
to
get
a
*NL*
nurse
for
nothing
by
marrying
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jude
was
absolutely
indifferent
to
what
she
said
,
and
indeed
,
often
*NL*
regarded
her
abuse
in
a
humorous
light
.
Sometimes
his
mood
was
more
*NL*
earnest
,
and
as
he
lay
he
often
rambled
on
upon
the
defeat
of
his
*NL*
early
aims
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Every
man
has
some
little
power
in
some
one
direction
,
''
he
would
*NL*
say
.
``
I
was
never
really
stout
enough
for
the
stone
trade
,
*NL*
particularly
the
fixing
.
Moving
the
blocks
always
used
to
strain
*NL*
me
,
and
standing
the
trying
draughts
in
buildings
before
the
windows
*NL*
are
in
always
gave
me
colds
,
and
I
think
that
began
the
mischief
*NL*
inside
.
But
I
felt
I
could
do
one
thing
if
I
had
the
opportunity
.
*NL*
I
could
accumulate
ideas
,
and
impart
them
to
others
.
I
wonder
if
the
*NL*
founders
had
such
as
I
in
their
minds
--
a
fellow
good
for
nothing
else
*NL*
but
that
particular
thing
?
...
I
hear
that
soon
there
is
going
to
*NL*
be
a
better
chance
for
such
helpless
students
as
I
was
.
There
are
*NL*
schemes
afoot
for
making
the
university
less
exclusive
,
and
extending
*NL*
its
influence
.
I
do
n't
know
much
about
it
.
And
it
is
too
late
,
too
*NL*
late
for
me
!
Ah
--
and
for
how
many
worthier
ones
before
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
you
keep
a-mumbling
!
''
said
Arabella
.
``
I
should
have
thought
*NL*
you
'd
have
got
over
all
that
craze
about
books
by
this
time
.
And
so
*NL*
you
would
,
if
you
'd
had
any
sense
to
begin
with
.
You
are
as
bad
now
*NL*
as
when
we
were
first
married
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
one
occasion
while
soliloquizing
thus
he
called
her
``
Sue
''
*NL*
unconsciously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
you
'd
mind
who
you
are
talking
to
!
''
said
Arabella
*NL*
indignantly
.
``
Calling
a
respectable
married
woman
by
the
name
of
*NL*
that
--
''
She
remembered
herself
and
he
did
not
catch
the
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
in
the
course
of
time
,
when
she
saw
how
things
were
going
,
and
*NL*
how
very
little
she
had
to
fear
from
Sue
's
rivalry
,
she
had
a
fit
of
*NL*
generosity
.
``
I
suppose
you
want
to
see
your
--
Sue
?
''
she
said
.
``
Well
,
*NL*
I
do
n't
mind
her
coming
.
You
can
have
her
here
if
you
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
wish
to
see
her
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
that
's
a
change
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
n't
tell
her
anything
about
me
--
that
I
'm
ill
,
or
anything
.
*NL*
She
has
chosen
her
course
.
Let
her
go
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
he
received
a
surprise
.
Mrs.
Edlin
came
to
see
him
,
quite
*NL*
on
her
own
account
.
Jude
's
wife
,
whose
feelings
as
to
where
his
*NL*
affections
were
centred
had
reached
absolute
indifference
by
*NL*
this
time
,
went
out
,
leaving
the
old
woman
alone
with
Jude
.
He
*NL*
impulsively
asked
how
Sue
was
,
and
then
said
bluntly
,
remembering
*NL*
what
Sue
had
told
him
:
``
I
suppose
they
are
still
only
husband
and
*NL*
wife
in
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Edlin
hesitated
.
``
Well
,
no
--
it
's
different
now
.
She
's
begun
it
*NL*
quite
lately
--
all
of
her
own
free
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
did
she
begin
?
''
he
asked
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
night
after
you
came
.
But
as
a
punishment
to
her
poor
self
.
*NL*
He
did
n't
wish
it
,
but
she
insisted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sue
,
my
Sue
--
you
darling
fool
--
this
is
almost
more
than
I
can
*NL*
endure
!
...
Mrs.
Edlin
--
do
n't
be
frightened
at
my
rambling
--
I
've
*NL*
got
to
talk
to
myself
lying
here
so
many
hours
alone
--
she
was
once
*NL*
a
woman
whose
intellect
was
to
mine
like
a
star
to
a
benzoline
lamp
:
*NL*
who
saw
all
MY
superstitions
as
cobwebs
that
she
could
brush
away
*NL*
with
a
word
.
Then
bitter
affliction
came
to
us
,
and
her
intellect
*NL*
broke
,
and
she
veered
round
to
darkness
.
Strange
difference
of
sex
,
*NL*
that
time
and
circumstance
,
which
enlarge
the
views
of
most
men
,
*NL*
narrow
the
views
of
women
almost
invariably
.
And
now
the
ultimate
*NL*
horror
has
come
--
her
giving
herself
like
this
to
what
she
loathes
,
in
*NL*
her
enslavement
to
forms
!
She
,
so
sensitive
,
so
shrinking
,
that
the
*NL*
very
wind
seemed
to
blow
on
her
with
a
touch
of
deference
...
As
for
*NL*
Sue
and
me
when
we
were
at
our
own
best
,
long
ago
--
when
our
minds
*NL*
were
clear
,
and
our
love
of
truth
fearless
--
the
time
was
not
ripe
*NL*
for
us
!
Our
ideas
were
fifty
years
too
soon
to
be
any
good
to
us
.
*NL*
And
so
the
resistance
they
met
with
brought
reaction
in
her
,
and
*NL*
recklessness
and
ruin
on
me
!
...
There
--
this
,
Mrs.
Edlin
,
is
how
*NL*
I
go
on
to
myself
continually
,
as
I
lie
here
.
I
must
be
boring
you
*NL*
awfully
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
,
my
dear
boy
.
I
could
hearken
to
`
ee
all
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Jude
reflected
more
and
more
on
her
news
,
and
grew
more
restless
,
*NL*
he
began
in
his
mental
agony
to
use
terribly
profane
language
about
*NL*
social
conventions
,
which
started
a
fit
of
coughing
.
Presently
there
*NL*
came
a
knock
at
the
door
downstairs
.
As
nobody
answered
it
Mrs.
*NL*
Edlin
herself
went
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
visitor
said
blandly
:
``
The
Doctor
.
''
The
lanky
form
was
that
of
*NL*
Physician
Vilbert
,
who
had
been
called
in
by
Arabella
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
my
patient
at
present
?
''
asked
the
physician
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
bad
--
very
bad
!
Poor
chap
,
he
got
excited
,
and
do
blaspeam
*NL*
terribly
,
since
I
let
out
some
gossip
by
accident
--
the
more
to
my
*NL*
blame
.
But
there
--
you
must
excuse
a
man
in
suffering
for
what
he
*NL*
says
,
and
I
hope
God
will
forgive
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
.
I
'll
go
up
and
see
him
.
Mrs.
Fawley
at
home
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
not
in
at
present
,
but
she
'll
be
here
soon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Vilbert
went
;
but
though
Jude
had
hitherto
taken
the
medicines
of
*NL*
that
skilful
practitioner
with
the
greatest
indifference
whenever
*NL*
poured
down
his
throat
by
Arabella
,
he
was
now
so
brought
to
bay
by
*NL*
events
that
he
vented
his
opinion
of
Vilbert
in
the
physician
's
face
,
*NL*
and
so
forcibly
,
and
with
such
striking
epithets
,
that
Vilbert
soon
*NL*
scurried
downstairs
again
.
At
the
door
he
met
Arabella
,
Mrs.
Edlin
*NL*
having
left
.
Arabella
inquired
how
he
thought
her
husband
was
*NL*
now
,
and
seeing
that
the
Doctor
looked
ruffled
,
asked
him
to
take
*NL*
something
.
He
assented
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
bring
it
to
you
here
in
the
passage
,
''
she
said
.
``
There
's
*NL*
nobody
but
me
about
the
house
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
brought
him
a
bottle
and
a
glass
,
and
he
drank
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arabella
began
shaking
with
suppressed
laughter
.
``
What
is
this
,
my
*NL*
dear
?
''
he
asked
,
smacking
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
a
drop
of
wine
--
and
something
in
it
.
''
Laughing
again
she
said
:
*NL*
``
I
poured
your
own
love-philtre
into
it
,
that
you
sold
me
at
the
*NL*
agricultural
show
,
do
n't
you
re-member
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
,
I
do
!
Clever
woman
!
But
you
must
be
prepared
for
the
*NL*
consequences
.
''
Putting
his
arm
round
her
shoulders
he
kissed
her
*NL*
there
and
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
do
n't
,
''
she
whispered
,
laughing
good-humouredly
.
``
My
man
will
*NL*
hear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
let
him
out
of
the
house
,
and
as
she
went
back
she
said
to
*NL*
herself
:
``
Well
!
Weak
women
must
provide
for
a
rainy
day

And
if
my
*NL*
poor
fellow
upstairs
do
go
off
--
as
I
suppose
he
will
soon
--
it
's
well
*NL*
to
keep
chances
open

And
I
ca
n't
pick
and
choose
now
as
I
could
*NL*
when
I
was
younger
.
And
one
must
take
the
old
if
one
ca
n't
get
the
*NL*
young

XI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
last
pages
to
which
the
chronicler
of
these
lives
would
ask
the
*NL*
reader
's
attention
are
concerned
with
the
scene
in
and
out
of
Jude
's
*NL*
bedroom
when
leafy
summer
came
round
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
face
was
now
so
thin
that
his
old
friends
would
hardly
have
known
*NL*
him
.
It
was
afternoon
,
and
Arabella
was
at
the
looking-glass
curling
*NL*
her
hair
,
which
operation
she
performed
by
heating
an
umbrella-stay
*NL*
in
the
flame
of
a
candle
she
had
lighted
,
and
using
it
upon
the
*NL*
flowing
lock
.
When
she
had
finished
this
,
practised
a
dimple
,
and
*NL*
put
on
her
things
,
she
cast
her
eyes
round
upon
Jude
.
He
seemed
to
*NL*
be
sleeping
,
though
his
position
was
an
elevated
one
,
his
malady
*NL*
preventing
him
lying
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arabella
,
hatted
,
gloved
,
and
ready
,
sat
down
and
waited
,
as
if
*NL*
expecting
some
one
to
come
and
take
her
place
as
nurse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Certain
sounds
from
without
revealed
that
the
town
was
in
festivity
,
*NL*
though
little
of
the
festival
,
whatever
it
might
have
been
,
could
be
*NL*
seen
here
.
Bells
began
to
ring
,
and
the
notes
came
into
the
room
*NL*
through
the
open
window
,
and
travelled
round
Jude
's
head
in
a
hum
.
*NL*
They
made
her
restless
,
and
at
last
she
said
to
herself
:
``
Why
ever
*NL*
does
n't
Father
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
again
at
Jude
,
critically
gauged
his
ebbing
life
,
as
she
*NL*
had
done
so
many
times
during
the
late
months
,
and
glancing
at
his
*NL*
watch
,
which
was
hung
up
by
way
of
timepiece
,
rose
impatiently
.
*NL*
Still
he
slept
,
and
coming
to
a
resolution
she
slipped
from
the
room
,
*NL*
closed
the
door
noiselessly
,
and
descended
the
stairs
.
The
house
*NL*
was
empty
.
The
attraction
which
moved
Arabella
to
go
abroad
had
*NL*
evidently
drawn
away
the
other
inmates
long
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
warm
,
cloudless
,
enticing
day
.
She
shut
the
front
door
,
and
*NL*
hastened
round
into
Chief
Street
,
and
when
near
the
theatre
could
*NL*
hear
the
notes
of
the
organ
,
a
rehearsal
for
a
coming
concert
being
*NL*
in
progress
.
She
entered
under
the
archway
of
Oldgate
College
,
where
*NL*
men
were
putting
up
awnings
round
the
quadrangle
for
a
ball
in
the
*NL*
hall
that
evening
.
People
who
had
come
up
from
the
country
for
the
*NL*
day
were
picnicking
on
the
grass
,
and
Arabella
walked
along
the
*NL*
gravel
paths
and
under
the
aged
limes
.
But
finding
this
place
rather
*NL*
dull
she
returned
to
the
streets
,
and
watched
the
carriages
drawing
*NL*
up
for
the
concert
,
numerous
Dons
and
their
wives
,
and
undergraduates
*NL*
with
gay
female
companions
,
crowding
up
likewise
.
When
the
doors
*NL*
were
closed
,
and
the
concert
began
,
she
moved
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
powerful
notes
of
that
concert
rolled
forth
through
the
swinging
*NL*
yellow
blinds
of
the
open
windows
,
over
the
housetops
,
and
into
the
*NL*
still
air
of
the
lanes
.
They
reached
so
far
as
to
the
room
in
which
*NL*
Jude
lay
;
and
it
was
about
this
time
that
his
cough
began
again
and
*NL*
awakened
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
he
could
speak
he
murmured
,
his
eyes
still
closed
:
``
A
*NL*
little
water
,
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
but
the
deserted
room
received
his
appeal
,
and
he
coughed
*NL*
to
exhaustion
again
--
saying
still
more
feebly
:
``
Water
--
some
*NL*
water
--
Sue
--
Arabella
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
room
remained
still
as
before
.
Presently
he
gasped
again
:
*NL*
``
Throat
--
water
--
Sue
--
darling
--
drop
of
water
--
please
--
oh
please
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
water
came
,
and
the
organ
notes
,
faint
as
a
bee
's
hum
,
rolled
in
*NL*
as
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
he
remained
,
his
face
changing
,
shouts
and
hurrahs
came
from
*NL*
somewhere
in
the
direction
of
the
river
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
--
yes
!
The
Remembrance
games
,
''
he
murmured
.
``
And
I
here
.
And
*NL*
Sue
defiled
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
hurrahs
were
repeated
,
drowning
the
faint
organ
notes
.
Jude
's
*NL*
face
changed
more
:
he
whispered
slowly
,
his
parched
lips
scarcely
*NL*
moving
:
*NL*
*NL*
_
``
Let
the
day
perish
wherein
I
was
born
,
and
the
night
in
which
it
*NL*
was
said
,
There
is
a
man-child
conceived
.
''
_
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
``
Hurrah
!
''
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
_
``
Let
that
day
be
darkness
;
let
not
God
regard
it
from
above
,
neither
*NL*
let
the
light
shine
upon
it
.
Lo
,
let
that
night
be
solitary
,
let
no
*NL*
joyful
voice
come
therein
.
''
_
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
``
Hurrah
!
''
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
_
``
Why
died
I
not
from
the
womb
?
Why
did
I
not
give
up
the
ghost
when
*NL*
I
came
out
of
the
belly
?
...
For
now
should
I
have
lain
still
and
*NL*
been
quiet
.
I
should
have
slept
:
then
had
I
been
at
rest
!

_
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
``
Hurrah
!
''
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
_
``
There
the
prisoners
rest
together
;
they
hear
not
the
voice
of
the
*NL*
oppressor
...
The
small
and
the
great
are
there
;
and
the
servant
is
*NL*
free
from
his
master
.
Wherefore
is
light
given
to
him
that
is
in
*NL*
misery
,
and
life
unto
the
bitter
in
soul
?

*NL*
Meanwhile
Arabella
,
in
her
journey
to
discover
what
was
going
on
,
*NL*
took
a
short
cut
down
a
narrow
street
and
through
an
obscure
nook
*NL*
into
the
quad
of
Cardinal
.
It
was
full
of
bustle
,
and
brilliant
*NL*
in
the
sunlight
with
flowers
and
other
preparations
for
a
ball
*NL*
here
also
.
A
carpenter
nodded
to
her
,
one
who
had
formerly
been
a
*NL*
fellow-workman
of
Jude
's
.
A
corridor
was
in
course
of
erection
from
*NL*
the
entrance
to
the
hall
staircase
,
of
gay
red
and
buff
bunting
.
*NL*
Waggon-loads
of
boxes
containing
bright
plants
in
full
bloom
were
*NL*
being
placed
about
,
and
the
great
staircase
was
covered
with
red
*NL*
cloth
.
She
nodded
to
one
workman
and
another
,
and
ascended
to
the
*NL*
hall
on
the
strength
of
their
acquaintance
,
where
they
were
putting
*NL*
down
a
new
floor
and
decorating
for
the
dance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cathedral
bell
close
at
hand
was
sounding
for
five
o'clock
*NL*
service
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
not
mind
having
a
spin
there
with
a
fellow
's
arm
round
my
*NL*
waist
,
''
she
said
to
one
of
the
men
.
``
But
Lord
,
I
must
be
getting
*NL*
home
again
--
there
's
a
lot
to
do
.
No
dancing
for
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
reached
home
she
was
met
at
the
door
by
Stagg
,
and
one
or
*NL*
two
other
of
Jude
's
fellow
stoneworkers
.
``
We
are
just
going
down
*NL*
to
the
river
,
''
said
the
former
,
``
to
see
the
boat-bumping
.
But
we
've
*NL*
called
round
on
our
way
to
ask
how
your
husband
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
sleeping
nicely
,
thank
you
,
''
said
Arabella
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
right
.
Well
now
,
ca
n't
you
give
yourself
half
an
hour
's
*NL*
relaxation
,
Mrs.
Fawley
,
and
come
along
with
us
?
`
Twould
do
you
*NL*
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
to
go
,
''
said
she
.
``
I
've
never
seen
the
boat-racing
,
*NL*
and
I
hear
it
is
good
fun
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
along
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
I
WISH
I
could
!
''
She
looked
longingly
down
the
street
.
``
Wait
*NL*
a
minute
,
then
.
I
'll
just
run
up
and
see
how
he
is
now
.
Father
is
*NL*
with
him
,
I
believe
;
so
I
can
most
likely
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
waited
,
and
she
entered
.
Downstairs
the
inmates
were
absent
*NL*
as
before
,
having
,
in
fact
,
gone
in
a
body
to
the
river
where
the
*NL*
procession
of
boats
was
to
pass
.
When
she
reached
the
bedroom
she
*NL*
found
that
her
father
had
not
even
now
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
could
n't
he
have
been
here
!
''
she
said
impatiently
.
``
He
wants
to
*NL*
see
the
boats
himself
--
that
's
what
it
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
on
looking
round
to
the
bed
she
brightened
,
for
she
saw
*NL*
that
Jude
was
apparently
sleeping
,
though
he
was
not
in
the
usual
*NL*
half-elevated
posture
necessitated
by
his
cough
.
He
had
slipped
*NL*
down
,
and
lay
flat
.
A
second
glance
caused
her
to
start
,
and
she
*NL*
went
to
the
bed
.
His
face
was
quite
white
,
and
gradually
becoming
*NL*
rigid
.
She
touched
his
fingers
;
they
were
cold
,
though
his
body
was
*NL*
still
warm
.
She
listened
at
his
chest
.
All
was
still
within
.
The
*NL*
bumping
of
near
thirty
years
had
ceased
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
her
first
appalled
sense
of
what
had
happened
,
the
faint
notes
*NL*
of
a
military
or
other
brass
band
from
the
river
reached
her
ears
;
*NL*
and
in
a
provoked
tone
she
exclaimed
,
``
To
think
he
should
die
just
*NL*
now
!
Why
did
he
die
just
now
!
''
Then
meditating
another
moment
or
*NL*
two
she
went
to
the
door
,
softly
closed
it
as
before
,
and
again
*NL*
descended
the
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
she
is
!
''
said
one
of
the
workmen
.
``
We
wondered
if
you
were
*NL*
coming
after
all
.
Come
along
;
we
must
be
quick
to
get
a
good
*NL*
place
...
Well
,
how
is
he
?
Sleeping
well
still
?
Of
course
,
we
do
n't
*NL*
want
to
drag
`
ee
away
if
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
--
sleeping
quite
sound
.
He
wo
n't
wake
yet
,
''
she
said
*NL*
hurriedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
with
the
crowd
down
Cardinal
Street
,
where
they
presently
*NL*
reached
the
bridge
,
and
the
gay
barges
burst
upon
their
view
.
Thence
*NL*
they
passed
by
a
narrow
slit
down
to
the
riverside
path
--
now
dusty
,
*NL*
hot
,
and
thronged
.
Almost
as
soon
as
they
had
arrived
the
grand
*NL*
procession
of
boats
began
;
the
oars
smacking
with
a
loud
kiss
on
the
*NL*
face
of
the
stream
,
as
they
were
lowered
from
the
perpendicular
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
say
--
how
jolly
!
I
'm
glad
I
've
come
,
''
said
Arabella
.
``
And
--
it
*NL*
ca
n't
hurt
my
husband
--
my
being
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
,
on
the
crowded
barges
,
were
*NL*
gorgeous
nosegays
of
feminine
beauty
,
fashionably
arrayed
in
green
,
*NL*
pink
,
blue
,
and
white
.
The
blue
flag
of
the
boat
club
denoted
the
*NL*
centre
of
interest
,
beneath
which
a
band
in
red
uniform
gave
out
the
*NL*
notes
she
had
already
heard
in
the
death-chamber
.
Collegians
of
all
*NL*
sorts
,
in
canoes
with
ladies
,
watching
keenly
for
``
our
''
boat
,
darted
*NL*
up
and
down
.
While
she
regarded
the
lively
scene
somebody
touched
*NL*
Arabella
in
the
ribs
,
and
looking
round
she
saw
Vilbert
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
philtre
is
operating
,
you
know
!
''
he
said
with
a
leer
.
``
Shame
*NL*
on
`
ee
to
wreck
a
heart
so
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
sha
n't
talk
of
love
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
It
is
a
general
holiday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
reply
.
Vilbert
's
arm
stole
round
her
waist
,
which
act
*NL*
could
be
performed
unobserved
in
the
crowd
.
An
arch
expression
*NL*
overspread
Arabella
's
face
at
the
feel
of
the
arm
,
but
she
kept
her
*NL*
eyes
on
the
river
as
if
she
did
not
know
of
the
embrace
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
crowd
surged
,
pushing
Arabella
and
her
friends
sometimes
nearly
*NL*
into
the
river
,
and
she
would
have
laughed
heartily
at
the
horse-play
*NL*
that
succeeded
,
if
the
imprint
on
her
mind
's
eye
of
a
pale
,
*NL*
statuesque
countenance
she
had
lately
gazed
upon
had
not
sobered
her
*NL*
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fun
on
the
water
reached
the
acme
of
excitement
;
there
were
*NL*
immersions
,
there
were
shouts
:
the
race
was
lost
and
won
,
the
pink
*NL*
and
blue
and
yellow
ladies
retired
from
the
barges
,
and
the
people
*NL*
who
had
watched
began
to
move
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
it
's
been
awfully
good
,
''
cried
Arabella
.
``
But
I
think
I
must
*NL*
get
back
to
my
poor
man
.
Father
is
there
,
so
far
as
I
know
;
but
I
*NL*
had
better
get
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
your
hurry
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
must
go
...
Dear
,
dear
,
this
is
awkward
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
narrow
gangway
where
the
people
ascended
from
the
riverside
*NL*
path
to
the
bridge
the
crowd
was
literally
jammed
into
one
hot
*NL*
mass
--
Arabella
and
Vilbert
with
the
rest
;
and
here
they
remained
*NL*
motionless
,
Arabella
exclaiming
,
``
Dear
,
dear
!
''
more
and
more
*NL*
impatiently
;
for
it
had
just
occurred
to
her
mind
that
if
Jude
were
*NL*
discovered
to
have
died
alone
an
inquest
might
be
deemed
necessary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
fidget
you
are
,
my
love
,
''
said
the
physician
,
who
,
being
*NL*
pressed
close
against
her
by
the
throng
,
had
no
need
of
personal
*NL*
effort
for
contact
.
``
Just
as
well
have
patience
:
there
's
no
getting
*NL*
away
yet
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
nearly
ten
minutes
before
the
wedged
multitude
moved
*NL*
sufficiently
to
let
them
pass
through
.
As
soon
as
she
got
up
*NL*
into
the
street
Arabella
hastened
on
,
forbidding
the
physician
to
*NL*
accompany
her
further
that
day
.
She
did
not
go
straight
to
her
*NL*
house
;
but
to
the
abode
of
a
woman
who
performed
the
last
necessary
*NL*
offices
for
the
poorer
dead
;
where
she
knocked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
husband
has
just
gone
,
poor
soul
,
''
she
said
.
``
Can
you
come
and
*NL*
lay
him
out
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Arabella
waited
a
few
minutes
;
and
the
two
women
went
along
,
elbowing
*NL*
their
way
through
the
stream
of
fashionable
people
pouring
out
of
*NL*
Cardinal
meadow
,
and
being
nearly
knocked
down
by
the
carriages
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
call
at
the
sexton
's
about
the
bell
,
too
,
''
said
Arabella
.
*NL*
``
It
is
just
round
here
,
is
n't
it
?
I
'll
meet
you
at
my
door
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
ten
o'clock
that
night
Jude
was
lying
on
the
bedstead
at
his
*NL*
lodging
covered
with
a
sheet
,
and
straight
as
an
arrow
.
Through
the
*NL*
partly
opened
window
the
joyous
throb
of
a
waltz
entered
from
the
*NL*
ball-room
at
Cardinal
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Two
days
later
,
when
the
sky
was
equally
cloudless
,
and
the
air
*NL*
equally
still
,
two
persons
stood
beside
Jude
's
open
coffin
in
the
*NL*
same
little
bedroom
.
On
one
side
was
Arabella
,
on
the
other
the
*NL*
Widow
Edlin
.
They
were
both
looking
at
Jude
's
face
,
the
worn
old
*NL*
eyelids
of
Mrs.
Edlin
being
red
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
beautiful
he
is
!
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
He
's
a
`
andsome
corpse
,
''
said
Arabella
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
window
was
still
open
to
ventilate
the
room
,
and
it
being
about
*NL*
noontide
the
clear
air
was
motionless
and
quiet
without
.
From
a
*NL*
distance
came
voices
;
and
an
apparent
noise
of
persons
stamping
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
that
?
''
murmured
the
old
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
's
the
Doctors
in
the
theatre
,
conferring
Honorary
degrees
*NL*
on
the
Duke
of
Hamptonshire
and
a
lot
more
illustrious
gents
of
that
*NL*
sort
.
It
's
Remembrance
Week
,
you
know
.
The
cheers
come
from
the
*NL*
young
men
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
;
young
and
strong-lunged
!
Not
like
our
poor
boy
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
An
occasional
word
,
as
from
some
one
making
a
speech
,
floated
from
*NL*
the
open
windows
of
the
theatre
across
to
this
quiet
corner
,
at
which
*NL*
there
seemed
to
be
a
smile
of
some
sort
upon
the
marble
features
*NL*
of
Jude
;
while
the
old
,
superseded
,
Delphin
editions
of
Virgil
and
*NL*
Horace
,
and
the
dog-eared
Greek
Testament
on
the
neighbouring
shelf
,
*NL*
and
the
few
other
volumes
of
the
sort
that
he
had
not
parted
with
,
*NL*
roughened
with
stone-dust
where
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
catching
*NL*
them
up
for
a
few
minutes
between
his
labours
,
seemed
to
pale
to
a
*NL*
sickly
cast
at
the
sounds
.
The
bells
struck
out
joyously
;
and
their
*NL*
reverberations
travelled
round
the
bed-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arabella
's
eyes
removed
from
Jude
to
Mrs.
Edlin
.
``
D'ye
think
she
*NL*
will
come
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
not
say
.
She
swore
not
to
see
him
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
she
looking
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tired
and
miserable
,
poor
heart
.
Years
and
years
older
than
when
*NL*
you
saw
her
last

Quite
a
staid
,
worn
woman
now

'T
is

If

*NL*
``
That

what
we

Did

*NL*
``
No

Quite
the
contrary

I
offered
to
send

he
said
I
was
not

her
know

ill

was

Did

Well

poor

found
forgiveness

She

she

She
may
swear
that
on

the
holy
cross
upon

she
's
hoarse

it

Arabella

She
's
*NL*
never

peace
