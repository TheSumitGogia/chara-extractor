Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
four
o'clock
when
the
ceremony
was
over
and
the
carriages
began
*NL*
to
arrive
.
There
had
been
a
crowd
following
all
the
way
,
owing
to
the
*NL*
exuberance
of
Marija
Berczynskas
.
The
occasion
rested
heavily
upon
*NL*
Marija
's
broad
shoulders
--
it
was
her
task
to
see
that
all
things
went
in
*NL*
due
form
,
and
after
the
best
home
traditions
;
and
,
flying
wildly
*NL*
hither
and
thither
,
bowling
every
one
out
of
the
way
,
and
scolding
and
*NL*
exhorting
all
day
with
her
tremendous
voice
,
Marija
was
too
eager
to
see
*NL*
that
others
conformed
to
the
proprieties
to
consider
them
herself
.
She
*NL*
had
left
the
church
last
of
all
,
and
,
desiring
to
arrive
first
at
the
*NL*
hall
,
had
issued
orders
to
the
coachman
to
drive
faster
.
When
that
*NL*
personage
had
developed
a
will
of
his
own
in
the
matter
,
Marija
had
*NL*
flung
up
the
window
of
the
carriage
,
and
,
leaning
out
,
proceeded
to
*NL*
tell
him
her
opinion
of
him
,
first
in
Lithuanian
,
which
he
did
not
*NL*
understand
,
and
then
in
Polish
,
which
he
did
.
Having
the
advantage
of
*NL*
her
in
altitude
,
the
driver
had
stood
his
ground
and
even
ventured
to
*NL*
attempt
to
speak
;
and
the
result
had
been
a
furious
altercation
,
which
,
*NL*
continuing
all
the
way
down
Ashland
Avenue
,
had
added
a
new
swarm
of
*NL*
urchins
to
the
cortege
at
each
side
street
for
half
a
mile
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
unfortunate
,
for
already
there
was
a
throng
before
the
door
.
*NL*
The
music
had
started
up
,
and
half
a
block
away
you
could
hear
the
dull
*NL*
``
broom
,
broom
''
of
a
cello
,
with
the
squeaking
of
two
fiddles
which
vied
*NL*
with
each
other
in
intricate
and
altitudinous
gymnastics
.
Seeing
*NL*
the
throng
,
Marija
abandoned
precipitately
the
debate
concerning
the
*NL*
ancestors
of
her
coachman
,
and
,
springing
from
the
moving
carriage
,
*NL*
plunged
in
and
proceeded
to
clear
a
way
to
the
hall
.
Once
within
,
she
*NL*
turned
and
began
to
push
the
other
way
,
roaring
,
meantime
,
``
Eik
!
Eik
!
*NL*
Uzdaryk-duris
!
''
in
tones
which
made
the
orchestral
uproar
sound
like
*NL*
fairy
music
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Z.
Graiczunas
,
Pasilinksminimams
darzas
.
Vynas
.
Sznapsas
.
Wines
and
*NL*
Liquors
.
Union
Headquarters
''
--
that
was
the
way
the
signs
ran
.
The
*NL*
reader
,
who
perhaps
has
never
held
much
converse
in
the
language
of
*NL*
far-off
Lithuania
,
will
be
glad
of
the
explanation
that
the
place
was
*NL*
the
rear
room
of
a
saloon
in
that
part
of
Chicago
known
as
``
back
of
the
*NL*
yards
.
''
This
information
is
definite
and
suited
to
the
matter
of
fact
;
*NL*
but
how
pitifully
inadequate
it
would
have
seemed
to
one
who
understood
*NL*
that
it
was
also
the
supreme
hour
of
ecstasy
in
the
life
of
one
of
*NL*
God
's
gentlest
creatures
,
the
scene
of
the
wedding
feast
and
the
*NL*
joy-transfiguration
of
little
Ona
Lukoszaite
!
*NL*
*NL*
She
stood
in
the
doorway
,
shepherded
by
Cousin
Marija
,
breathless
from
*NL*
pushing
through
the
crowd
,
and
in
her
happiness
painful
to
look
upon
.
*NL*
There
was
a
light
of
wonder
in
her
eyes
and
her
lids
trembled
,
and
*NL*
her
otherwise
wan
little
face
was
flushed
.
She
wore
a
muslin
dress
,
*NL*
conspicuously
white
,
and
a
stiff
little
veil
coming
to
her
shoulders
.
*NL*
There
were
five
pink
paper
roses
twisted
in
the
veil
,
and
eleven
bright
*NL*
green
rose
leaves
.
There
were
new
white
cotton
gloves
upon
her
hands
,
*NL*
and
as
she
stood
staring
about
her
she
twisted
them
together
feverishly
.
*NL*
It
was
almost
too
much
for
her
--
you
could
see
the
pain
of
too
great
*NL*
emotion
in
her
face
,
and
all
the
tremor
of
her
form
.
She
was
so
*NL*
young
--
not
quite
sixteen
--
and
small
for
her
age
,
a
mere
child
;
and
she
*NL*
had
just
been
married
--
and
married
to
Jurgis
,
*
-LRB-
*
Pronounced
Yoorghis
-RRB-
of
*NL*
all
men
,
to
Jurgis
Rudkus
,
he
with
the
white
flower
in
the
buttonhole
of
*NL*
his
new
black
suit
,
he
with
the
mighty
shoulders
and
the
giant
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ona
was
blue-eyed
and
fair
,
while
Jurgis
had
great
black
eyes
with
*NL*
beetling
brows
,
and
thick
black
hair
that
curled
in
waves
about
his
*NL*
ears
--
in
short
,
they
were
one
of
those
incongruous
and
impossible
*NL*
married
couples
with
which
Mother
Nature
so
often
wills
to
*NL*
confound
all
prophets
,
before
and
after
.
Jurgis
could
take
up
a
*NL*
two-hundred-and-fifty-pound
quarter
of
beef
and
carry
it
into
a
car
*NL*
without
a
stagger
,
or
even
a
thought
;
and
now
he
stood
in
a
far
corner
,
*NL*
frightened
as
a
hunted
animal
,
and
obliged
to
moisten
his
lips
with
*NL*
his
tongue
each
time
before
he
could
answer
the
congratulations
of
his
*NL*
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gradually
there
was
effected
a
separation
between
the
spectators
and
*NL*
the
guests
--
a
separation
at
least
sufficiently
complete
for
working
*NL*
purposes
.
There
was
no
time
during
the
festivities
which
ensued
when
*NL*
there
were
not
groups
of
onlookers
in
the
doorways
and
the
corners
;
*NL*
and
if
any
one
of
these
onlookers
came
sufficiently
close
,
or
looked
*NL*
sufficiently
hungry
,
a
chair
was
offered
him
,
and
he
was
invited
to
the
*NL*
feast
.
It
was
one
of
the
laws
of
the
veselija
that
no
one
goes
hungry
;
*NL*
and
,
while
a
rule
made
in
the
forests
of
Lithuania
is
hard
to
apply
*NL*
in
the
stockyards
district
of
Chicago
,
with
its
quarter
of
a
million
*NL*
inhabitants
,
still
they
did
their
best
,
and
the
children
who
ran
in
*NL*
from
the
street
,
and
even
the
dogs
,
went
out
again
happier
.
A
charming
*NL*
informality
was
one
of
the
characteristics
of
this
celebration
.
The
men
*NL*
wore
their
hats
,
or
,
if
they
wished
,
they
took
them
off
,
and
their
coats
*NL*
with
them
;
they
ate
when
and
where
they
pleased
,
and
moved
as
often
as
*NL*
they
pleased
.
There
were
to
be
speeches
and
singing
,
but
no
one
had
to
*NL*
listen
who
did
not
care
to
;
if
he
wished
,
meantime
,
to
speak
or
sing
*NL*
himself
,
he
was
perfectly
free
.
The
resulting
medley
of
sound
distracted
*NL*
no
one
,
save
possibly
alone
the
babies
,
of
which
there
were
present
a
*NL*
number
equal
to
the
total
possessed
by
all
the
guests
invited
.
There
was
*NL*
no
other
place
for
the
babies
to
be
,
and
so
part
of
the
preparations
*NL*
for
the
evening
consisted
of
a
collection
of
cribs
and
carriages
in
one
*NL*
corner
.
In
these
the
babies
slept
,
three
or
four
together
,
or
wakened
*NL*
together
,
as
the
case
might
be
.
Those
who
were
still
older
,
and
could
*NL*
reach
the
tables
,
marched
about
munching
contentedly
at
meat
bones
and
*NL*
bologna
sausages
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
room
is
about
thirty
feet
square
,
with
whitewashed
walls
,
bare
save
*NL*
for
a
calendar
,
a
picture
of
a
race
horse
,
and
a
family
tree
in
a
gilded
*NL*
frame
.
To
the
right
there
is
a
door
from
the
saloon
,
with
a
few
loafers
*NL*
in
the
doorway
,
and
in
the
corner
beyond
it
a
bar
,
with
a
presiding
*NL*
genius
clad
in
soiled
white
,
with
waxed
black
mustaches
and
a
carefully
*NL*
oiled
curl
plastered
against
one
side
of
his
forehead
.
In
the
opposite
*NL*
corner
are
two
tables
,
filling
a
third
of
the
room
and
laden
with
*NL*
dishes
and
cold
viands
,
which
a
few
of
the
hungrier
guests
are
already
*NL*
munching
.
At
the
head
,
where
sits
the
bride
,
is
a
snow-white
cake
,
with
*NL*
an
Eiffel
tower
of
constructed
decoration
,
with
sugar
roses
and
two
*NL*
angels
upon
it
,
and
a
generous
sprinkling
of
pink
and
green
and
yellow
*NL*
candies
.
Beyond
opens
a
door
into
the
kitchen
,
where
there
is
a
glimpse
*NL*
to
be
had
of
a
range
with
much
steam
ascending
from
it
,
and
many
women
,
*NL*
old
and
young
,
rushing
hither
and
thither
.
In
the
corner
to
the
left
are
*NL*
the
three
musicians
,
upon
a
little
platform
,
toiling
heroically
to
make
*NL*
some
impression
upon
the
hubbub
;
also
the
babies
,
similarly
occupied
,
*NL*
and
an
open
window
whence
the
populace
imbibes
the
sights
and
sounds
and
*NL*
odors
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
some
of
the
steam
begins
to
advance
,
and
,
peering
through
it
,
*NL*
you
discern
Aunt
Elizabeth
,
Ona
's
stepmother
--
Teta
Elzbieta
,
as
they
*NL*
call
her
--
bearing
aloft
a
great
platter
of
stewed
duck
.
Behind
her
is
*NL*
Kotrina
,
making
her
way
cautiously
,
staggering
beneath
a
similar
burden
;
*NL*
and
half
a
minute
later
there
appears
old
Grandmother
Majauszkiene
,
with
*NL*
a
big
yellow
bowl
of
smoking
potatoes
,
nearly
as
big
as
herself
.
So
,
bit
*NL*
by
bit
,
the
feast
takes
form
--
there
is
a
ham
and
a
dish
of
sauerkraut
,
*NL*
boiled
rice
,
macaroni
,
bologna
sausages
,
great
piles
of
penny
buns
,
*NL*
bowls
of
milk
,
and
foaming
pitchers
of
beer
.
There
is
also
,
not
six
feet
*NL*
from
your
back
,
the
bar
,
where
you
may
order
all
you
please
and
do
not
*NL*
have
to
pay
for
it
.
``
Eiksz
!
Graicziau
!
''
screams
Marija
Berczynskas
,
and
*NL*
falls
to
work
herself
--
for
there
is
more
upon
the
stove
inside
that
will
*NL*
be
spoiled
if
it
be
not
eaten
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
,
with
laughter
and
shouts
and
endless
badinage
and
merriment
,
the
*NL*
guests
take
their
places
.
The
young
men
,
who
for
the
most
part
have
*NL*
been
huddled
near
the
door
,
summon
their
resolution
and
advance
;
and
the
*NL*
shrinking
Jurgis
is
poked
and
scolded
by
the
old
folks
until
he
consents
*NL*
to
seat
himself
at
the
right
hand
of
the
bride
.
The
two
bridesmaids
,
*NL*
whose
insignia
of
office
are
paper
wreaths
,
come
next
,
and
after
them
*NL*
the
rest
of
the
guests
,
old
and
young
,
boys
and
girls
.
The
spirit
of
the
*NL*
occasion
takes
hold
of
the
stately
bartender
,
who
condescends
to
a
plate
*NL*
of
stewed
duck
;
even
the
fat
policeman
--
whose
duty
it
will
be
,
later
in
*NL*
the
evening
,
to
break
up
the
fights
--
draws
up
a
chair
to
the
foot
of
the
*NL*
table
.
And
the
children
shout
and
the
babies
yell
,
and
every
one
laughs
*NL*
and
sings
and
chatters
--
while
above
all
the
deafening
clamor
Cousin
*NL*
Marija
shouts
orders
to
the
musicians
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
musicians
--
how
shall
one
begin
to
describe
them
?
All
this
time
they
*NL*
have
been
there
,
playing
in
a
mad
frenzy
--
all
of
this
scene
must
be
*NL*
read
,
or
said
,
or
sung
,
to
music
.
It
is
the
music
which
makes
it
what
*NL*
it
is
;
it
is
the
music
which
changes
the
place
from
the
rear
room
of
*NL*
a
saloon
in
back
of
the
yards
to
a
fairy
place
,
a
wonderland
,
a
little
*NL*
corner
of
the
high
mansions
of
the
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
person
who
leads
this
trio
is
an
inspired
man
.
His
fiddle
*NL*
is
out
of
tune
,
and
there
is
no
rosin
on
his
bow
,
but
still
he
is
an
*NL*
inspired
man
--
the
hands
of
the
muses
have
been
laid
upon
him
.
He
plays
*NL*
like
one
possessed
by
a
demon
,
by
a
whole
horde
of
demons
.
You
can
*NL*
feel
them
in
the
air
round
about
him
,
capering
frenetically
;
with
their
*NL*
invisible
feet
they
set
the
pace
,
and
the
hair
of
the
leader
of
the
*NL*
orchestra
rises
on
end
,
and
his
eyeballs
start
from
their
sockets
,
as
he
*NL*
toils
to
keep
up
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tamoszius
Kuszleika
is
his
name
,
and
he
has
taught
himself
to
play
the
*NL*
violin
by
practicing
all
night
,
after
working
all
day
on
the
``
killing
*NL*
beds
.
''
He
is
in
his
shirt
sleeves
,
with
a
vest
figured
with
faded
gold
*NL*
horseshoes
,
and
a
pink-striped
shirt
,
suggestive
of
peppermint
candy
.
*NL*
A
pair
of
military
trousers
,
light
blue
with
a
yellow
stripe
,
serve
to
*NL*
give
that
suggestion
of
authority
proper
to
the
leader
of
a
band
.
He
is
*NL*
only
about
five
feet
high
,
but
even
so
these
trousers
are
about
eight
*NL*
inches
short
of
the
ground
.
You
wonder
where
he
can
have
gotten
them
or
*NL*
rather
you
would
wonder
,
if
the
excitement
of
being
in
his
presence
left
*NL*
you
time
to
think
of
such
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
he
is
an
inspired
man
.
Every
inch
of
him
is
inspired
--
you
might
*NL*
almost
say
inspired
separately
.
He
stamps
with
his
feet
,
he
tosses
his
*NL*
head
,
he
sways
and
swings
to
and
fro
;
he
has
a
wizened-up
little
face
,
*NL*
irresistibly
comical
;
and
,
when
he
executes
a
turn
or
a
flourish
,
his
*NL*
brows
knit
and
his
lips
work
and
his
eyelids
wink
--
the
very
ends
of
*NL*
his
necktie
bristle
out
.
And
every
now
and
then
he
turns
upon
his
*NL*
companions
,
nodding
,
signaling
,
beckoning
frantically
--
with
every
inch
*NL*
of
him
appealing
,
imploring
,
in
behalf
of
the
muses
and
their
call
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
they
are
hardly
worthy
of
Tamoszius
,
the
other
two
members
of
*NL*
the
orchestra
.
The
second
violin
is
a
Slovak
,
a
tall
,
gaunt
man
with
*NL*
black-rimmed
spectacles
and
the
mute
and
patient
look
of
an
overdriven
*NL*
mule
;
he
responds
to
the
whip
but
feebly
,
and
then
always
falls
*NL*
back
into
his
old
rut
.
The
third
man
is
very
fat
,
with
a
round
,
red
,
*NL*
sentimental
nose
,
and
he
plays
with
his
eyes
turned
up
to
the
sky
and
a
*NL*
look
of
infinite
yearning
.
He
is
playing
a
bass
part
upon
his
cello
,
*NL*
and
so
the
excitement
is
nothing
to
him
;
no
matter
what
happens
in
the
*NL*
treble
,
it
is
his
task
to
saw
out
one
long-drawn
and
lugubrious
note
*NL*
after
another
,
from
four
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
until
nearly
the
same
*NL*
hour
next
morning
,
for
his
third
of
the
total
income
of
one
dollar
per
*NL*
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
the
feast
has
been
five
minutes
under
way
,
Tamoszius
Kuszleika
*NL*
has
risen
in
his
excitement
;
a
minute
or
two
more
and
you
see
that
he
is
*NL*
beginning
to
edge
over
toward
the
tables
.
His
nostrils
are
dilated
and
*NL*
his
breath
comes
fast
--
his
demons
are
driving
him
.
He
nods
and
shakes
*NL*
his
head
at
his
companions
,
jerking
at
them
with
his
violin
,
until
at
*NL*
last
the
long
form
of
the
second
violinist
also
rises
up
.
In
the
end
*NL*
all
three
of
them
begin
advancing
,
step
by
step
,
upon
the
banqueters
,
*NL*
Valentinavyczia
,
the
cellist
,
bumping
along
with
his
instrument
between
*NL*
notes
.
Finally
all
three
are
gathered
at
the
foot
of
the
tables
,
and
*NL*
there
Tamoszius
mounts
upon
a
stool
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
he
is
in
his
glory
,
dominating
the
scene
.
Some
of
the
people
are
*NL*
eating
,
some
are
laughing
and
talking
--
but
you
will
make
a
great
mistake
*NL*
if
you
think
there
is
one
of
them
who
does
not
hear
him
.
His
notes
*NL*
are
never
true
,
and
his
fiddle
buzzes
on
the
low
ones
and
squeaks
and
*NL*
scratches
on
the
high
;
but
these
things
they
heed
no
more
than
they
heed
*NL*
the
dirt
and
noise
and
squalor
about
them
--
it
is
out
of
this
material
*NL*
that
they
have
to
build
their
lives
,
with
it
that
they
have
to
utter
*NL*
their
souls
.
And
this
is
their
utterance
;
merry
and
boisterous
,
or
*NL*
mournful
and
wailing
,
or
passionate
and
rebellious
,
this
music
is
their
*NL*
music
,
music
of
home
.
It
stretches
out
its
arms
to
them
,
they
have
*NL*
only
to
give
themselves
up
.
Chicago
and
its
saloons
and
its
slums
fade
*NL*
away
--
there
are
green
meadows
and
sunlit
rivers
,
mighty
forests
and
*NL*
snow-clad
hills
.
They
behold
home
landscapes
and
childhood
scenes
*NL*
returning
;
old
loves
and
friendships
begin
to
waken
,
old
joys
and
griefs
*NL*
to
laugh
and
weep
.
Some
fall
back
and
close
their
eyes
,
some
beat
upon
*NL*
the
table
.
Now
and
then
one
leaps
up
with
a
cry
and
calls
for
this
song
*NL*
or
that
;
and
then
the
fire
leaps
brighter
in
Tamoszius
'
eyes
,
and
he
*NL*
flings
up
his
fiddle
and
shouts
to
his
companions
,
and
away
they
go
in
*NL*
mad
career
.
The
company
takes
up
the
choruses
,
and
men
and
women
cry
out
*NL*
like
all
possessed
;
some
leap
to
their
feet
and
stamp
upon
the
floor
,
*NL*
lifting
their
glasses
and
pledging
each
other
.
Before
long
it
occurs
to
*NL*
some
one
to
demand
an
old
wedding
song
,
which
celebrates
the
beauty
of
*NL*
the
bride
and
the
joys
of
love
.
In
the
excitement
of
this
masterpiece
*NL*
Tamoszius
Kuszleika
begins
to
edge
in
between
the
tables
,
making
his
*NL*
way
toward
the
head
,
where
sits
the
bride
.
There
is
not
a
foot
of
space
*NL*
between
the
chairs
of
the
guests
,
and
Tamoszius
is
so
short
that
he
*NL*
pokes
them
with
his
bow
whenever
he
reaches
over
for
the
low
notes
;
but
*NL*
still
he
presses
in
,
and
insists
relentlessly
that
his
companions
must
*NL*
follow
.
During
their
progress
,
needless
to
say
,
the
sounds
of
the
cello
*NL*
are
pretty
well
extinguished
;
but
at
last
the
three
are
at
the
head
,
and
*NL*
Tamoszius
takes
his
station
at
the
right
hand
of
the
bride
and
begins
to
*NL*
pour
out
his
soul
in
melting
strains
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Ona
is
too
excited
to
eat
.
Once
in
a
while
she
tastes
a
little
*NL*
something
,
when
Cousin
Marija
pinches
her
elbow
and
reminds
her
;
but
,
*NL*
for
the
most
part
,
she
sits
gazing
with
the
same
fearful
eyes
of
wonder
.
*NL*
Teta
Elzbieta
is
all
in
a
flutter
,
like
a
hummingbird
;
her
sisters
,
*NL*
too
,
keep
running
up
behind
her
,
whispering
,
breathless
.
But
Ona
seems
*NL*
scarcely
to
hear
them
--
the
music
keeps
calling
,
and
the
far-off
look
*NL*
comes
back
,
and
she
sits
with
her
hands
pressed
together
over
her
heart
.
*NL*
Then
the
tears
begin
to
come
into
her
eyes
;
and
as
she
is
ashamed
to
*NL*
wipe
them
away
,
and
ashamed
to
let
them
run
down
her
cheeks
,
she
turns
*NL*
and
shakes
her
head
a
little
,
and
then
flushes
red
when
she
sees
that
*NL*
Jurgis
is
watching
her
.
When
in
the
end
Tamoszius
Kuszleika
has
reached
*NL*
her
side
,
and
is
waving
his
magic
wand
above
her
,
Ona
's
cheeks
are
*NL*
scarlet
,
and
she
looks
as
if
she
would
have
to
get
up
and
run
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
crisis
,
however
,
she
is
saved
by
Marija
Berczynskas
,
whom
*NL*
the
muses
suddenly
visit
.
Marija
is
fond
of
a
song
,
a
song
of
lovers
'
*NL*
parting
;
she
wishes
to
hear
it
,
and
,
as
the
musicians
do
not
know
it
,
*NL*
she
has
risen
,
and
is
proceeding
to
teach
them
.
Marija
is
short
,
but
*NL*
powerful
in
build
.
She
works
in
a
canning
factory
,
and
all
day
long
she
*NL*
handles
cans
of
beef
that
weigh
fourteen
pounds
.
She
has
a
broad
*NL*
Slavic
face
,
with
prominent
red
cheeks
.
When
she
opens
her
mouth
,
it
*NL*
is
tragical
,
but
you
can
not
help
thinking
of
a
horse
.
She
wears
a
blue
*NL*
flannel
shirt-waist
,
which
is
now
rolled
up
at
the
sleeves
,
disclosing
*NL*
her
brawny
arms
;
she
has
a
carving
fork
in
her
hand
,
with
which
she
*NL*
pounds
on
the
table
to
mark
the
time
.
As
she
roars
her
song
,
in
a
voice
*NL*
of
which
it
is
enough
to
say
that
it
leaves
no
portion
of
the
room
*NL*
vacant
,
the
three
musicians
follow
her
,
laboriously
and
note
by
note
,
*NL*
but
averaging
one
note
behind
;
thus
they
toil
through
stanza
after
*NL*
stanza
of
a
lovesick
swain
's
lamentation
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sudiev
'
kvietkeli
,

;
*NL*
Sudiev

,

*NL*

--
paskyre

Aukszcziausis
,
*NL*
Jog

''
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
song
is
over
,
it
is
time
for
the
speech
,
and
old
Dede
Antanas
*NL*
rises
to
his
feet
.
Grandfather
Anthony
,
Jurgis
'
father
,
is
not
more
than
*NL*
sixty
years
of
age
,
but
you
would
think
that
he
was
eighty
.
He
has
been
*NL*
only
six
months
in
America
,
and
the
change
has
not
done
him
good
.
In
his
*NL*
manhood
he
worked
in
a
cotton
mill
,
but
then
a
coughing
fell
upon
him
,
*NL*
and
he
had
to
leave
;
out
in
the
country
the
trouble
disappeared
,
but
he
*NL*
has
been
working
in
the
pickle
rooms
at
Durham
's
,
and
the
breathing
of
*NL*
the
cold
,
damp
air
all
day
has
brought
it
back
.
Now
as
he
rises
he
is
*NL*
seized
with
a
coughing
fit
,
and
holds
himself
by
his
chair
and
turns
*NL*
away
his
wan
and
battered
face
until
it
passes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Generally
it
is
the
custom
for
the
speech
at
a
veselija
to
be
taken
out
*NL*
of
one
of
the
books
and
learned
by
heart
;
but
in
his
youthful
days
Dede
*NL*
Antanas
used
to
be
a
scholar
,
and
really
make
up
all
the
love
letters
*NL*
of
his
friends
.
Now
it
is
understood
that
he
has
composed
an
original
*NL*
speech
of
congratulation
and
benediction
,
and
this
is
one
of
the
events
*NL*
of
the
day
.
Even
the
boys
,
who
are
romping
about
the
room
,
draw
near
and
*NL*
listen
,
and
some
of
the
women
sob
and
wipe
their
aprons
in
their
eyes
.
*NL*
It
is
very
solemn
,
for
Antanas
Rudkus
has
become
possessed
of
the
idea
*NL*
that
he
has
not
much
longer
to
stay
with
his
children
.
His
speech
leaves
*NL*
them
all
so
tearful
that
one
of
the
guests
,
Jokubas
Szedvilas
,
who
keeps
*NL*
a
delicatessen
store
on
Halsted
Street
,
and
is
fat
and
hearty
,
is
moved
*NL*
to
rise
and
say
that
things
may
not
be
as
bad
as
that
,
and
then
to
go
on
*NL*
and
make
a
little
speech
of
his
own
,
in
which
he
showers
congratulations
*NL*
and
prophecies
of
happiness
upon
the
bride
and
groom
,
proceeding
to
*NL*
particulars
which
greatly
delight
the
young
men
,
but
which
cause
Ona
*NL*
to
blush
more
furiously
than
ever
.
Jokubas
possesses
what
his
*NL*
wife
complacently
describes
as
``
poetiszka
vaidintuve
''
--
a
poetical
*NL*
imagination
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
a
good
many
of
the
guests
have
finished
,
and
,
since
there
is
no
*NL*
pretense
of
ceremony
,
the
banquet
begins
to
break
up
.
Some
of
the
men
*NL*
gather
about
the
bar
;
some
wander
about
,
laughing
and
singing
;
here
*NL*
and
there
will
be
a
little
group
,
chanting
merrily
,
and
in
sublime
*NL*
indifference
to
the
others
and
to
the
orchestra
as
well
.
Everybody
is
*NL*
more
or
less
restless
--
one
would
guess
that
something
is
on
their
minds
.
*NL*
And
so
it
proves
.
The
last
tardy
diners
are
scarcely
given
time
to
*NL*
finish
,
before
the
tables
and
the
debris
are
shoved
into
the
corner
,
and
*NL*
the
chairs
and
the
babies
piled
out
of
the
way
,
and
the
real
celebration
*NL*
of
the
evening
begins
.
Then
Tamoszius
Kuszleika
,
after
replenishing
*NL*
himself
with
a
pot
of
beer
,
returns
to
his
platform
,
and
,
standing
up
,
*NL*
reviews
the
scene
;
he
taps
authoritatively
upon
the
side
of
his
violin
,
*NL*
then
tucks
it
carefully
under
his
chin
,
then
waves
his
bow
in
an
*NL*
elaborate
flourish
,
and
finally
smites
the
sounding
strings
and
closes
*NL*
his
eyes
,
and
floats
away
in
spirit
upon
the
wings
of
a
dreamy
waltz
.
*NL*
His
companion
follows
,
but
with
his
eyes
open
,
watching
where
he
treads
,
*NL*
so
to
speak
;
and
finally
Valentinavyczia
,
after
waiting
for
a
little
and
*NL*
beating
with
his
foot
to
get
the
time
,
casts
up
his
eyes
to
the
ceiling
*NL*
and
begins
to
saw
--
``
Broom
!
broom
!
broom
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
company
pairs
off
quickly
,
and
the
whole
room
is
soon
in
motion
.
*NL*
Apparently
nobody
knows
how
to
waltz
,
but
that
is
nothing
of
any
*NL*
consequence
--
there
is
music
,
and
they
dance
,
each
as
he
pleases
,
just
*NL*
as
before
they
sang
.
Most
of
them
prefer
the
``
two-step
,
''
especially
the
*NL*
young
,
with
whom
it
is
the
fashion
.
The
older
people
have
dances
from
*NL*
home
,
strange
and
complicated
steps
which
they
execute
with
grave
*NL*
solemnity
.
Some
do
not
dance
anything
at
all
,
but
simply
hold
each
*NL*
other
's
hands
and
allow
the
undisciplined
joy
of
motion
to
express
*NL*
itself
with
their
feet
.
Among
these
are
Jokubas
Szedvilas
and
his
wife
,
*NL*
Lucija
,
who
together
keep
the
delicatessen
store
,
and
consume
nearly
*NL*
as
much
as
they
sell
;
they
are
too
fat
to
dance
,
but
they
stand
in
the
*NL*
middle
of
the
floor
,
holding
each
other
fast
in
their
arms
,
rocking
*NL*
slowly
from
side
to
side
and
grinning
seraphically
,
a
picture
of
*NL*
toothless
and
perspiring
ecstasy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
these
older
people
many
wear
clothing
reminiscent
in
some
detail
*NL*
of
home
--
an
embroidered
waistcoat
or
stomacher
,
or
a
gaily
colored
*NL*
handkerchief
,
or
a
coat
with
large
cuffs
and
fancy
buttons
.
All
these
*NL*
things
are
carefully
avoided
by
the
young
,
most
of
whom
have
learned
to
*NL*
speak
English
and
to
affect
the
latest
style
of
clothing
.
The
girls
wear
*NL*
ready-made
dresses
or
shirt
waists
,
and
some
of
them
look
quite
pretty
.
*NL*
Some
of
the
young
men
you
would
take
to
be
Americans
,
of
the
type
of
*NL*
clerks
,
but
for
the
fact
that
they
wear
their
hats
in
the
room
.
Each
of
*NL*
these
younger
couples
affects
a
style
of
its
own
in
dancing
.
Some
hold
*NL*
each
other
tightly
,
some
at
a
cautious
distance
.
Some
hold
their
*NL*
hands
out
stiffly
,
some
drop
them
loosely
at
their
sides
.
Some
dance
*NL*
springily
,
some
glide
softly
,
some
move
with
grave
dignity
.
There
are
*NL*
boisterous
couples
,
who
tear
wildly
about
the
room
,
knocking
every
one
*NL*
out
of
their
way
.
There
are
nervous
couples
,
whom
these
frighten
,
and
*NL*
who
cry
,
``
Nusfok
!
Kas
yra
?
''
at
them
as
they
pass
.
Each
couple
is
paired
*NL*
for
the
evening
--
you
will
never
see
them
change
about
.
There
is
Alena
*NL*
Jasaityte
,
for
instance
,
who
has
danced
unending
hours
with
Juozas
*NL*
Raczius
,
to
whom
she
is
engaged
.
Alena
is
the
beauty
of
the
evening
,
*NL*
and
she
would
be
really
beautiful
if
she
were
not
so
proud
.
She
wears
*NL*
a
white
shirtwaist
,
which
represents
,
perhaps
,
half
a
week
's
labor
*NL*
painting
cans
.
She
holds
her
skirt
with
her
hand
as
she
dances
,
with
*NL*
stately
precision
,
after
the
manner
of
the
grandes
dames
.
Juozas
is
*NL*
driving
one
of
Durham
's
wagons
,
and
is
making
big
wages
.
He
affects
a
*NL*
``
tough
''
aspect
,
wearing
his
hat
on
one
side
and
keeping
a
cigarette
in
*NL*
his
mouth
all
the
evening
.
Then
there
is
Jadvyga
Marcinkus
,
who
is
also
*NL*
beautiful
,
but
humble
.
Jadvyga
likewise
paints
cans
,
but
then
she
has
*NL*
an
invalid
mother
and
three
little
sisters
to
support
by
it
,
and
so
she
*NL*
does
not
spend
her
wages
for
shirtwaists
.
Jadvyga
is
small
and
delicate
,
*NL*
with
jet-black
eyes
and
hair
,
the
latter
twisted
into
a
little
knot
and
*NL*
tied
on
the
top
of
her
head
.
She
wears
an
old
white
dress
which
she
*NL*
has
made
herself
and
worn
to
parties
for
the
past
five
years
;
it
is
*NL*
high-waisted
--
almost
under
her
arms
,
and
not
very
becoming
,
--
but
that
*NL*
does
not
trouble
Jadvyga
,
who
is
dancing
with
her
Mikolas
.
She
is
small
,
*NL*
while
he
is
big
and
powerful
;
she
nestles
in
his
arms
as
if
she
would
*NL*
hide
herself
from
view
,
and
leans
her
head
upon
his
shoulder
.
He
in
turn
*NL*
has
clasped
his
arms
tightly
around
her
,
as
if
he
would
carry
her
away
;
*NL*
and
so
she
dances
,
and
will
dance
the
entire
evening
,
and
would
dance
*NL*
forever
,
in
ecstasy
of
bliss
.
You
would
smile
,
perhaps
,
to
see
them
--
but
*NL*
you
would
not
smile
if
you
knew
all
the
story
.
This
is
the
fifth
year
,
*NL*
now
,
that
Jadvyga
has
been
engaged
to
Mikolas
,
and
her
heart
is
sick
.
*NL*
They
would
have
been
married
in
the
beginning
,
only
Mikolas
has
a
father
*NL*
who
is
drunk
all
day
,
and
he
is
the
only
other
man
in
a
large
family
.
*NL*
Even
so
they
might
have
managed
it
-LRB-
for
Mikolas
is
a
skilled
man
-RRB-
but
*NL*
for
cruel
accidents
which
have
almost
taken
the
heart
out
of
them
.
He
is
*NL*
a
beef-boner
,
and
that
is
a
dangerous
trade
,
especially
when
you
are
on
*NL*
piecework
and
trying
to
earn
a
bride
.
Your
hands
are
slippery
,
and
your
*NL*
knife
is
slippery
,
and
you
are
toiling
like
mad
,
when
somebody
happens
*NL*
to
speak
to
you
,
or
you
strike
a
bone
.
Then
your
hand
slips
up
on
the
*NL*
blade
,
and
there
is
a
fearful
gash
.
And
that
would
not
be
so
bad
,
only
*NL*
for
the
deadly
contagion
.
The
cut
may
heal
,
but
you
never
can
tell
.
*NL*
Twice
now
;
within
the
last
three
years
,
Mikolas
has
been
lying
at
home
*NL*
with
blood
poisoning
--
once
for
three
months
and
once
for
nearly
seven
.
*NL*
The
last
time
,
too
,
he
lost
his
job
,
and
that
meant
six
weeks
more
of
*NL*
standing
at
the
doors
of
the
packing
houses
,
at
six
o'clock
on
bitter
*NL*
winter
mornings
,
with
a
foot
of
snow
on
the
ground
and
more
in
the
air
.
*NL*
There
are
learned
people
who
can
tell
you
out
of
the
statistics
that
*NL*
beef-boners
make
forty
cents
an
hour
,
but
,
perhaps
,
these
people
have
*NL*
never
looked
into
a
beef-boner
's
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Tamoszius
and
his
companions
stop
for
a
rest
,
as
perforce
they
*NL*
must
,
now
and
then
,
the
dancers
halt
where
they
are
and
wait
patiently
.
*NL*
They
never
seem
to
tire
;
and
there
is
no
place
for
them
to
sit
down
*NL*
if
they
did
.
It
is
only
for
a
minute
,
anyway
,
for
the
leader
starts
up
*NL*
again
,
in
spite
of
all
the
protests
of
the
other
two
.
This
time
it
is
*NL*
another
sort
of
a
dance
,
a
Lithuanian
dance
.
Those
who
prefer
to
,
go
on
*NL*
with
the
two-step
,
but
the
majority
go
through
an
intricate
series
of
*NL*
motions
,
resembling
more
fancy
skating
than
a
dance
.
The
climax
of
it
is
*NL*
a
furious
prestissimo
,
at
which
the
couples
seize
hands
and
begin
a
mad
*NL*
whirling
.
This
is
quite
irresistible
,
and
every
one
in
the
room
joins
*NL*
in
,
until
the
place
becomes
a
maze
of
flying
skirts
and
bodies
quite
*NL*
dazzling
to
look
upon
.
But
the
sight
of
sights
at
this
moment
is
*NL*
Tamoszius
Kuszleika
.
The
old
fiddle
squeaks
and
shrieks
in
protest
,
but
*NL*
Tamoszius
has
no
mercy
.
The
sweat
starts
out
on
his
forehead
,
and
he
*NL*
bends
over
like
a
cyclist
on
the
last
lap
of
a
race
.
His
body
shakes
and
*NL*
throbs
like
a
runaway
steam
engine
,
and
the
ear
can
not
follow
the
flying
*NL*
showers
of
notes
--
there
is
a
pale
blue
mist
where
you
look
to
see
his
*NL*
bowing
arm
.
With
a
most
wonderful
rush
he
comes
to
the
end
of
the
tune
,
*NL*
and
flings
up
his
hands
and
staggers
back
exhausted
;
and
with
a
final
*NL*
shout
of
delight
the
dancers
fly
apart
,
reeling
here
and
there
,
bringing
*NL*
up
against
the
walls
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
there
is
beer
for
every
one
,
the
musicians
included
,
and
*NL*
the
revelers
take
a
long
breath
and
prepare
for
the
great
event
of
the
*NL*
evening
,
which
is
the
acziavimas
.
The
acziavimas
is
a
ceremony
which
,
*NL*
once
begun
,
will
continue
for
three
or
four
hours
,
and
it
involves
one
*NL*
uninterrupted
dance
.
The
guests
form
a
great
ring
,
locking
hands
,
and
,
*NL*
when
the
music
starts
up
,
begin
to
move
around
in
a
circle
.
In
the
*NL*
center
stands
the
bride
,
and
,
one
by
one
,
the
men
step
into
the
*NL*
enclosure
and
dance
with
her
.
Each
dances
for
several
minutes
--
as
long
*NL*
as
he
pleases
;
it
is
a
very
merry
proceeding
,
with
laughter
and
singing
,
*NL*
and
when
the
guest
has
finished
,
he
finds
himself
face
to
face
with
Teta
*NL*
Elzbieta
,
who
holds
the
hat
.
Into
it
he
drops
a
sum
of
money
--
a
dollar
,
*NL*
or
perhaps
five
dollars
,
according
to
his
power
,
and
his
estimate
of
*NL*
the
value
of
the
privilege
.
The
guests
are
expected
to
pay
for
this
*NL*
entertainment
;
if
they
be
proper
guests
,
they
will
see
that
there
is
a
*NL*
neat
sum
left
over
for
the
bride
and
bridegroom
to
start
life
upon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Most
fearful
they
are
to
contemplate
,
the
expenses
of
this
*NL*
entertainment
.
They
will
certainly
be
over
two
hundred
dollars
and
maybe
*NL*
three
hundred
;
and
three
hundred
dollars
is
more
than
the
year
's
income
*NL*
of
many
a
person
in
this
room
.
There
are
able-bodied
men
here
who
work
*NL*
from
early
morning
until
late
at
night
,
in
ice-cold
cellars
with
a
*NL*
quarter
of
an
inch
of
water
on
the
floor
--
men
who
for
six
or
seven
*NL*
months
in
the
year
never
see
the
sunlight
from
Sunday
afternoon
till
*NL*
the
next
Sunday
morning
--
and
who
can
not
earn
three
hundred
dollars
in
*NL*
a
year
.
There
are
little
children
here
,
scarce
in
their
teens
,
who
can
*NL*
hardly
see
the
top
of
the
work
benches
--
whose
parents
have
lied
to
get
*NL*
them
their
places
--
and
who
do
not
make
the
half
of
three
hundred
dollars
*NL*
a
year
,
and
perhaps
not
even
the
third
of
it
.
And
then
to
spend
such
*NL*
a
sum
,
all
in
a
single
day
of
your
life
,
at
a
wedding
feast
!
-LRB-
For
*NL*
obviously
it
is
the
same
thing
,
whether
you
spend
it
at
once
for
your
*NL*
own
wedding
,
or
in
a
long
time
,
at
the
weddings
of
all
your
friends
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
very
imprudent
,
it
is
tragic
--
but
,
ah
,
it
is
so
beautiful
!
Bit
by
*NL*
bit
these
poor
people
have
given
up
everything
else
;
but
to
this
*NL*
they
cling
with
all
the
power
of
their
souls
--
they
can
not
give
up
the
*NL*
veselija
!
To
do
that
would
mean
,
not
merely
to
be
defeated
,
but
to
*NL*
acknowledge
defeat
--
and
the
difference
between
these
two
things
is
what
*NL*
keeps
the
world
going
.
The
veselija
has
come
down
to
them
from
a
far-off
*NL*
time
;
and
the
meaning
of
it
was
that
one
might
dwell
within
the
cave
*NL*
and
gaze
upon
shadows
,
provided
only
that
once
in
his
lifetime
he
could
*NL*
break
his
chains
,
and
feel
his
wings
,
and
behold
the
sun
;
provided
that
*NL*
once
in
his
lifetime
he
might
testify
to
the
fact
that
life
,
with
all
*NL*
its
cares
and
its
terrors
,
is
no
such
great
thing
after
all
,
but
merely
*NL*
a
bubble
upon
the
surface
of
a
river
,
a
thing
that
one
may
toss
about
*NL*
and
play
with
as
a
juggler
tosses
his
golden
balls
,
a
thing
that
one
may
*NL*
quaff
,
like
a
goblet
of
rare
red
wine
.
Thus
having
known
himself
for
*NL*
the
master
of
things
,
a
man
could
go
back
to
his
toil
and
live
upon
the
*NL*
memory
all
his
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Endlessly
the
dancers
swung
round
and
round
--
when
they
were
dizzy
they
*NL*
swung
the
other
way
.
Hour
after
hour
this
had
continued
--
the
darkness
*NL*
had
fallen
and
the
room
was
dim
from
the
light
of
two
smoky
oil
lamps
.
*NL*
The
musicians
had
spent
all
their
fine
frenzy
by
now
,
and
played
only
*NL*
one
tune
,
wearily
,
ploddingly
.
There
were
twenty
bars
or
so
of
it
,
and
*NL*
when
they
came
to
the
end
they
began
again
.
Once
every
ten
minutes
or
so
*NL*
they
would
fail
to
begin
again
,
but
instead
would
sink
back
exhausted
;
a
*NL*
circumstance
which
invariably
brought
on
a
painful
and
terrifying
scene
,
*NL*
that
made
the
fat
policeman
stir
uneasily
in
his
sleeping
place
behind
*NL*
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
all
Marija
Berczynskas
.
Marija
was
one
of
those
hungry
souls
who
*NL*
cling
with
desperation
to
the
skirts
of
the
retreating
muse
.
All
day
*NL*
long
she
had
been
in
a
state
of
wonderful
exaltation
;
and
now
it
was
*NL*
leaving
--
and
she
would
not
let
it
go
.
Her
soul
cried
out
in
the
words
of
*NL*
Faust
,
``
Stay
,
thou
art
fair
!
''
Whether
it
was
by
beer
,
or
by
shouting
,
or
*NL*
by
music
,
or
by
motion
,
she
meant
that
it
should
not
go
.
And
she
would
*NL*
go
back
to
the
chase
of
it
--
and
no
sooner
be
fairly
started
than
her
*NL*
chariot
would
be
thrown
off
the
track
,
so
to
speak
,
by
the
stupidity
of
*NL*
those
thrice
accursed
musicians
.
Each
time
,
Marija
would
emit
a
howl
and
*NL*
fly
at
them
,
shaking
her
fists
in
their
faces
,
stamping
upon
the
floor
,
*NL*
purple
and
incoherent
with
rage
.
In
vain
the
frightened
Tamoszius
would
*NL*
attempt
to
speak
,
to
plead
the
limitations
of
the
flesh
;
in
vain
would
*NL*
the
puffing
and
breathless
ponas
Jokubas
insist
,
in
vain
would
Teta
*NL*
Elzbieta
implore
.
``
Szalin
!
''
Marija
would
scream
.
``
Palauk
!
isz
kelio
!
*NL*
What
are
you
paid
for
,
children
of
hell
?
''
And
so
,
in
sheer
terror
,
the
*NL*
orchestra
would
strike
up
again
,
and
Marija
would
return
to
her
place
*NL*
and
take
up
her
task
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
bore
all
the
burden
of
the
festivities
now
.
Ona
was
kept
up
by
her
*NL*
excitement
,
but
all
of
the
women
and
most
of
the
men
were
tired
--
the
*NL*
soul
of
Marija
was
alone
unconquered
.
She
drove
on
the
dancers
--
what
had
*NL*
once
been
the
ring
had
now
the
shape
of
a
pear
,
with
Marija
at
the
stem
,
*NL*
pulling
one
way
and
pushing
the
other
,
shouting
,
stamping
,
singing
,
a
*NL*
very
volcano
of
energy
.
Now
and
then
some
one
coming
in
or
out
would
*NL*
leave
the
door
open
,
and
the
night
air
was
chill
;
Marija
as
she
passed
*NL*
would
stretch
out
her
foot
and
kick
the
doorknob
,
and
slam
would
go
*NL*
the
door
!
Once
this
procedure
was
the
cause
of
a
calamity
of
which
*NL*
Sebastijonas
Szedvilas
was
the
hapless
victim
.
Little
Sebastijonas
,
aged
*NL*
three
,
had
been
wandering
about
oblivious
to
all
things
,
holding
turned
*NL*
up
over
his
mouth
a
bottle
of
liquid
known
as
``
pop
,
''
pink-colored
,
*NL*
ice-cold
,
and
delicious
.
Passing
through
the
doorway
the
door
smote
*NL*
him
full
,
and
the
shriek
which
followed
brought
the
dancing
to
a
halt
.
*NL*
Marija
,
who
threatened
horrid
murder
a
hundred
times
a
day
,
and
would
*NL*
weep
over
the
injury
of
a
fly
,
seized
little
Sebastijonas
in
her
arms
*NL*
and
bid
fair
to
smother
him
with
kisses
.
There
was
a
long
rest
for
the
*NL*
orchestra
,
and
plenty
of
refreshments
,
while
Marija
was
making
her
peace
*NL*
with
her
victim
,
seating
him
upon
the
bar
,
and
standing
beside
him
and
*NL*
holding
to
his
lips
a
foaming
schooner
of
beer
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
there
was
going
on
in
another
corner
of
the
room
an
*NL*
anxious
conference
between
Teta
Elzbieta
and
Dede
Antanas
,
and
a
few
of
*NL*
the
more
intimate
friends
of
the
family
.
A
trouble
was
come
upon
them
.
*NL*
The
veselija
is
a
compact
,
a
compact
not
expressed
,
but
therefore
only
*NL*
the
more
binding
upon
all
.
Every
one
's
share
was
different
--
and
yet
*NL*
every
one
knew
perfectly
well
what
his
share
was
,
and
strove
to
give
a
*NL*
little
more
.
Now
,
however
,
since
they
had
come
to
the
new
country
,
all
*NL*
this
was
changing
;
it
seemed
as
if
there
must
be
some
subtle
poison
in
*NL*
the
air
that
one
breathed
here
--
it
was
affecting
all
the
young
men
at
*NL*
once
.
They
would
come
in
crowds
and
fill
themselves
with
a
fine
dinner
,
*NL*
and
then
sneak
off
.
One
would
throw
another
's
hat
out
of
the
window
,
and
*NL*
both
would
go
out
to
get
it
,
and
neither
could
be
seen
again
.
Or
now
*NL*
and
then
half
a
dozen
of
them
would
get
together
and
march
out
openly
,
*NL*
staring
at
you
,
and
making
fun
of
you
to
your
face
.
Still
others
,
worse
*NL*
yet
,
would
crowd
about
the
bar
,
and
at
the
expense
of
the
host
drink
*NL*
themselves
sodden
,
paying
not
the
least
attention
to
any
one
,
and
*NL*
leaving
it
to
be
thought
that
either
they
had
danced
with
the
bride
*NL*
already
,
or
meant
to
later
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
these
things
were
going
on
now
,
and
the
family
was
helpless
with
*NL*
dismay
.
So
long
they
had
toiled
,
and
such
an
outlay
they
had
made
!
Ona
*NL*
stood
by
,
her
eyes
wide
with
terror
.
Those
frightful
bills
--
how
they
had
*NL*
haunted
her
,
each
item
gnawing
at
her
soul
all
day
and
spoiling
her
rest
*NL*
at
night
.
How
often
she
had
named
them
over
one
by
one
and
figured
*NL*
on
them
as
she
went
to
work
--
fifteen
dollars
for
the
hall
,
twenty-two
*NL*
dollars
and
a
quarter
for
the
ducks
,
twelve
dollars
for
the
musicians
,
*NL*
five
dollars
at
the
church
,
and
a
blessing
of
the
Virgin
besides
--
and
so
*NL*
on
without
an
end
!
Worst
of
all
was
the
frightful
bill
that
was
still
to
*NL*
come
from
Graiczunas
for
the
beer
and
liquor
that
might
be
consumed
.
*NL*
One
could
never
get
in
advance
more
than
a
guess
as
to
this
from
*NL*
a
saloon-keeper
--
and
then
,
when
the
time
came
he
always
came
to
you
*NL*
scratching
his
head
and
saying
that
he
had
guessed
too
low
,
but
that
he
*NL*
had
done
his
best
--
your
guests
had
gotten
so
very
drunk
.
By
him
you
*NL*
were
sure
to
be
cheated
unmercifully
,
and
that
even
though
you
thought
*NL*
yourself
the
dearest
of
the
hundreds
of
friends
he
had
.
He
would
begin
*NL*
to
serve
your
guests
out
of
a
keg
that
was
half
full
,
and
finish
with
*NL*
one
that
was
half
empty
,
and
then
you
would
be
charged
for
two
kegs
of
*NL*
beer
.
He
would
agree
to
serve
a
certain
quality
at
a
certain
price
,
and
*NL*
when
the
time
came
you
and
your
friends
would
be
drinking
some
horrible
*NL*
poison
that
could
not
be
described
.
You
might
complain
,
but
you
would
*NL*
get
nothing
for
your
pains
but
a
ruined
evening
;
while
,
as
for
going
to
*NL*
law
about
it
,
you
might
as
well
go
to
heaven
at
once
.
The
saloon-keeper
*NL*
stood
in
with
all
the
big
politics
men
in
the
district
;
and
when
you
had
*NL*
once
found
out
what
it
meant
to
get
into
trouble
with
such
people
,
you
*NL*
would
know
enough
to
pay
what
you
were
told
to
pay
and
shut
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
made
all
this
the
more
painful
was
that
it
was
so
hard
on
the
few
*NL*
that
had
really
done
their
best
.
There
was
poor
old
ponas
Jokubas
,
for
*NL*
instance
--
he
had
already
given
five
dollars
,
and
did
not
every
one
know
*NL*
that
Jokubas
Szedvilas
had
just
mortgaged
his
delicatessen
store
for
two
*NL*
hundred
dollars
to
meet
several
months
'
overdue
rent
?
And
then
there
was
*NL*
withered
old
poni
Aniele
--
who
was
a
widow
,
and
had
three
children
,
and
*NL*
the
rheumatism
besides
,
and
did
washing
for
the
tradespeople
on
Halsted
*NL*
Street
at
prices
it
would
break
your
heart
to
hear
named
.
Aniele
had
*NL*
given
the
entire
profit
of
her
chickens
for
several
months
.
Eight
of
*NL*
them
she
owned
,
and
she
kept
them
in
a
little
place
fenced
around
on
her
*NL*
backstairs
.
All
day
long
the
children
of
Aniele
were
raking
in
the
dump
*NL*
for
food
for
these
chickens
;
and
sometimes
,
when
the
competition
there
*NL*
was
too
fierce
,
you
might
see
them
on
Halsted
Street
walking
close
to
*NL*
the
gutters
,
and
with
their
mother
following
to
see
that
no
one
robbed
*NL*
them
of
their
finds
.
Money
could
not
tell
the
value
of
these
chickens
*NL*
to
old
Mrs.
Jukniene
--
she
valued
them
differently
,
for
she
had
a
feeling
*NL*
that
she
was
getting
something
for
nothing
by
means
of
them
--
that
with
*NL*
them
she
was
getting
the
better
of
a
world
that
was
getting
the
better
*NL*
of
her
in
so
many
other
ways
.
So
she
watched
them
every
hour
of
the
day
,
*NL*
and
had
learned
to
see
like
an
owl
at
night
to
watch
them
then
.
One
of
*NL*
them
had
been
stolen
long
ago
,
and
not
a
month
passed
that
some
one
*NL*
did
not
try
to
steal
another
.
As
the
frustrating
of
this
one
attempt
*NL*
involved
a
score
of
false
alarms
,
it
will
be
understood
what
a
tribute
*NL*
old
Mrs.
Jukniene
brought
,
just
because
Teta
Elzbieta
had
once
loaned
*NL*
her
some
money
for
a
few
days
and
saved
her
from
being
turned
out
of
her
*NL*
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
More
and
more
friends
gathered
round
while
the
lamentation
about
*NL*
these
things
was
going
on
.
Some
drew
nearer
,
hoping
to
overhear
the
*NL*
conversation
,
who
were
themselves
among
the
guilty
--
and
surely
that
was
*NL*
a
thing
to
try
the
patience
of
a
saint
.
Finally
there
came
Jurgis
,
*NL*
urged
by
some
one
,
and
the
story
was
retold
to
him
.
Jurgis
listened
in
*NL*
silence
,
with
his
great
black
eyebrows
knitted
.
Now
and
then
there
would
*NL*
come
a
gleam
underneath
them
and
he
would
glance
about
the
room
.
Perhaps
*NL*
he
would
have
liked
to
go
at
some
of
those
fellows
with
his
big
clenched
*NL*
fists
;
but
then
,
doubtless
,
he
realized
how
little
good
it
would
do
him
.
*NL*
No
bill
would
be
any
less
for
turning
out
any
one
at
this
time
;
and
then
*NL*
there
would
be
the
scandal
--
and
Jurgis
wanted
nothing
except
to
get
away
*NL*
with
Ona
and
to
let
the
world
go
its
own
way
.
So
his
hands
relaxed
and
*NL*
he
merely
said
quietly
:
``
It
is
done
,
and
there
is
no
use
in
weeping
,
*NL*
Teta
Elzbieta
.
''
Then
his
look
turned
toward
Ona
,
who
stood
close
to
his
*NL*
side
,
and
he
saw
the
wide
look
of
terror
in
her
eyes
.
``
Little
one
,
''
he
*NL*
said
,
in
a
low
voice
,
``
do
not
worry
--
it
will
not
matter
to
us
.
We
will
*NL*
pay
them
all
somehow
.
I
will
work
harder
.
''
That
was
always
what
Jurgis
*NL*
said
.
Ona
had
grown
used
to
it
as
the
solution
of
all
difficulties
--
``
I
*NL*
will
work
harder
!
''
He
had
said
that
in
Lithuania
when
one
official
had
*NL*
taken
his
passport
from
him
,
and
another
had
arrested
him
for
being
*NL*
without
it
,
and
the
two
had
divided
a
third
of
his
belongings
.
He
had
*NL*
said
it
again
in
New
York
,
when
the
smooth-spoken
agent
had
taken
them
*NL*
in
hand
and
made
them
pay
such
high
prices
,
and
almost
prevented
their
*NL*
leaving
his
place
,
in
spite
of
their
paying
.
Now
he
said
it
a
third
*NL*
time
,
and
Ona
drew
a
deep
breath
;
it
was
so
wonderful
to
have
a
husband
,
*NL*
just
like
a
grown
woman
--
and
a
husband
who
could
solve
all
problems
,
and
*NL*
who
was
so
big
and
strong
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
last
sob
of
little
Sebastijonas
has
been
stifled
,
and
the
orchestra
*NL*
has
once
more
been
reminded
of
its
duty
.
The
ceremony
begins
again
--
but
*NL*
there
are
few
now
left
to
dance
with
,
and
so
very
soon
the
collection
is
*NL*
over
and
promiscuous
dances
once
more
begin
.
It
is
now
after
midnight
,
*NL*
however
,
and
things
are
not
as
they
were
before
.
The
dancers
are
dull
*NL*
and
heavy
--
most
of
them
have
been
drinking
hard
,
and
have
long
ago
*NL*
passed
the
stage
of
exhilaration
.
They
dance
in
monotonous
measure
,
*NL*
round
after
round
,
hour
after
hour
,
with
eyes
fixed
upon
vacancy
,
as
if
*NL*
they
were
only
half
conscious
,
in
a
constantly
growing
stupor
.
The
men
*NL*
grasp
the
women
very
tightly
,
but
there
will
be
half
an
hour
together
*NL*
when
neither
will
see
the
other
's
face
.
Some
couples
do
not
care
to
*NL*
dance
,
and
have
retired
to
the
corners
,
where
they
sit
with
their
arms
*NL*
enlaced
.
Others
,
who
have
been
drinking
still
more
,
wander
about
the
*NL*
room
,
bumping
into
everything
;
some
are
in
groups
of
two
or
three
,
*NL*
singing
,
each
group
its
own
song
.
As
time
goes
on
there
is
a
variety
*NL*
of
drunkenness
,
among
the
younger
men
especially
.
Some
stagger
about
in
*NL*
each
other
's
arms
,
whispering
maudlin
words
--
others
start
quarrels
upon
*NL*
the
slightest
pretext
,
and
come
to
blows
and
have
to
be
pulled
apart
.
*NL*
Now
the
fat
policeman
wakens
definitely
,
and
feels
of
his
club
to
*NL*
see
that
it
is
ready
for
business
.
He
has
to
be
prompt
--
for
these
*NL*
two-o'clock-in-the-morning
fights
,
if
they
once
get
out
of
hand
,
are
*NL*
like
a
forest
fire
,
and
may
mean
the
whole
reserves
at
the
station
.
The
*NL*
thing
to
do
is
to
crack
every
fighting
head
that
you
see
,
before
there
*NL*
are
so
many
fighting
heads
that
you
can
not
crack
any
of
them
.
There
is
*NL*
but
scant
account
kept
of
cracked
heads
in
back
of
the
yards
,
for
men
*NL*
who
have
to
crack
the
heads
of
animals
all
day
seem
to
get
into
the
*NL*
habit
,
and
to
practice
on
their
friends
,
and
even
on
their
families
,
*NL*
between
times
.
This
makes
it
a
cause
for
congratulation
that
by
*NL*
modern
methods
a
very
few
men
can
do
the
painfully
necessary
work
of
*NL*
head-cracking
for
the
whole
of
the
cultured
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
no
fight
that
night
--
perhaps
because
Jurgis
,
too
,
is
*NL*
watchful
--
even
more
so
than
the
policeman
.
Jurgis
has
drunk
a
great
*NL*
deal
,
as
any
one
naturally
would
on
an
occasion
when
it
all
has
to
be
*NL*
paid
for
,
whether
it
is
drunk
or
not
;
but
he
is
a
very
steady
man
,
and
*NL*
does
not
easily
lose
his
temper
.
Only
once
there
is
a
tight
shave
--
and
*NL*
that
is
the
fault
of
Marija
Berczynskas
.
Marija
has
apparently
concluded
*NL*
about
two
hours
ago
that
if
the
altar
in
the
corner
,
with
the
deity
in
*NL*
soiled
white
,
be
not
the
true
home
of
the
muses
,
it
is
,
at
any
rate
,
*NL*
the
nearest
substitute
on
earth
attainable
.
And
Marija
is
just
fighting
*NL*
drunk
when
there
come
to
her
ears
the
facts
about
the
villains
who
have
*NL*
not
paid
that
night
.
Marija
goes
on
the
warpath
straight
off
,
without
*NL*
even
the
preliminary
of
a
good
cursing
,
and
when
she
is
pulled
off
it
*NL*
is
with
the
coat
collars
of
two
villains
in
her
hands
.
Fortunately
,
the
*NL*
policeman
is
disposed
to
be
reasonable
,
and
so
it
is
not
Marija
who
is
*NL*
flung
out
of
the
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
interrupts
the
music
for
not
more
than
a
minute
or
two
.
Then
*NL*
again
the
merciless
tune
begins
--
the
tune
that
has
been
played
for
the
*NL*
last
half-hour
without
one
single
change
.
It
is
an
American
tune
this
*NL*
time
,
one
which
they
have
picked
up
on
the
streets
;
all
seem
to
know
the
*NL*
words
of
it
--
or
,
at
any
rate
,
the
first
line
of
it
,
which
they
hum
*NL*
to
themselves
,
over
and
over
again
without
rest
:
``
In
the
good
old
*NL*
summertime
--
in
the
good
old
summertime
!
In
the
good
old
summertime
--
in
*NL*
the
good
old
summertime
!
''
There
seems
to
be
something
hypnotic
about
*NL*
this
,
with
its
endlessly
recurring
dominant
.
It
has
put
a
stupor
upon
*NL*
every
one
who
hears
it
,
as
well
as
upon
the
men
who
are
playing
it
.
No
*NL*
one
can
get
away
from
it
,
or
even
think
of
getting
away
from
it
;
it
is
*NL*
three
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
and
they
have
danced
out
all
their
joy
,
*NL*
and
danced
out
all
their
strength
,
and
all
the
strength
that
unlimited
*NL*
drink
can
lend
them
--
and
still
there
is
no
one
among
them
who
has
the
*NL*
power
to
think
of
stopping
.
Promptly
at
seven
o'clock
this
same
Monday
*NL*
morning
they
will
every
one
of
them
have
to
be
in
their
places
at
*NL*
Durham
's
or
Brown
's
or
Jones
's
,
each
in
his
working
clothes
.
If
one
of
*NL*
them
be
a
minute
late
,
he
will
be
docked
an
hour
's
pay
,
and
if
he
be
*NL*
many
minutes
late
,
he
will
be
apt
to
find
his
brass
check
turned
to
the
*NL*
wall
,
which
will
send
him
out
to
join
the
hungry
mob
that
waits
every
*NL*
morning
at
the
gates
of
the
packing
houses
,
from
six
o'clock
until
*NL*
nearly
half-past
eight
.
There
is
no
exception
to
this
rule
,
not
even
*NL*
little
Ona
--
who
has
asked
for
a
holiday
the
day
after
her
wedding
day
,
*NL*
a
holiday
without
pay
,
and
been
refused
.
While
there
are
so
many
who
*NL*
are
anxious
to
work
as
you
wish
,
there
is
no
occasion
for
incommoding
*NL*
yourself
with
those
who
must
work
otherwise
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Ona
is
nearly
ready
to
faint
--
and
half
in
a
stupor
herself
,
*NL*
because
of
the
heavy
scent
in
the
room
.
She
has
not
taken
a
drop
,
but
*NL*
every
one
else
there
is
literally
burning
alcohol
,
as
the
lamps
are
*NL*
burning
oil
;
some
of
the
men
who
are
sound
asleep
in
their
chairs
or
*NL*
on
the
floor
are
reeking
of
it
so
that
you
can
not
go
near
them
.
Now
*NL*
and
then
Jurgis
gazes
at
her
hungrily
--
he
has
long
since
forgotten
his
*NL*
shyness
;
but
then
the
crowd
is
there
,
and
he
still
waits
and
watches
the
*NL*
door
,
where
a
carriage
is
supposed
to
come
.
It
does
not
,
and
finally
he
*NL*
will
wait
no
longer
,
but
comes
up
to
Ona
,
who
turns
white
and
trembles
.
*NL*
He
puts
her
shawl
about
her
and
then
his
own
coat
.
They
live
only
two
*NL*
blocks
away
,
and
Jurgis
does
not
care
about
the
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
almost
no
farewell
--
the
dancers
do
not
notice
them
,
and
all
*NL*
of
the
children
and
many
of
the
old
folks
have
fallen
asleep
of
sheer
*NL*
exhaustion
.
Dede
Antanas
is
asleep
,
and
so
are
the
Szedvilases
,
husband
*NL*
and
wife
,
the
former
snoring
in
octaves
.
There
is
Teta
Elzbieta
,
and
*NL*
Marija
,
sobbing
loudly
;
and
then
there
is
only
the
silent
night
,
with
*NL*
the
stars
beginning
to
pale
a
little
in
the
east
.
Jurgis
,
without
a
*NL*
word
,
lifts
Ona
in
his
arms
,
and
strides
out
with
her
,
and
she
sinks
her
*NL*
head
upon
his
shoulder
with
a
moan
.
When
he
reaches
home
he
is
not
sure
*NL*
whether
she
has
fainted
or
is
asleep
,
but
when
he
has
to
hold
her
with
*NL*
one
hand
while
he
unlocks
the
door
,
he
sees
that
she
has
opened
her
*NL*
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
shall
not
go
to
Brown
's
today
,
little
one
,
''
he
whispers
,
as
he
*NL*
climbs
the
stairs
;
and
she
catches
his
arm
in
terror
,
gasping
:
``
No
!
No
!
*NL*
I
dare
not
!
It
will
ruin
us
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
answers
her
again
:
``
Leave
it
to
me
;
leave
it
to
me
.
I
will
earn
*NL*
more
money
--
I
will
work
harder
.

Chapter
2
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
talked
lightly
about
work
,
because
he
was
young
.
They
told
him
*NL*
stories
about
the
breaking
down
of
men
,
there
in
the
stockyards
of
*NL*
Chicago
,
and
of
what
had
happened
to
them
afterward
--
stories
to
make
*NL*
your
flesh
creep
,
but
Jurgis
would
only
laugh
.
He
had
only
been
there
*NL*
four
months
,
and
he
was
young
,
and
a
giant
besides
.
There
was
too
much
*NL*
health
in
him
.
He
could
not
even
imagine
how
it
would
feel
to
be
beaten
.
*NL*
``
That
is
well
enough
for
men
like
you
,
''
he
would
say
,
``
silpnas
,
puny
*NL*
fellows
--
but
my
back
is
broad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
was
like
a
boy
,
a
boy
from
the
country
.
He
was
the
sort
of
man
*NL*
the
bosses
like
to
get
hold
of
,
the
sort
they
make
it
a
grievance
they
*NL*
can
not
get
hold
of
.
When
he
was
told
to
go
to
a
certain
place
,
he
would
*NL*
go
there
on
the
run
.
When
he
had
nothing
to
do
for
the
moment
,
he
would
*NL*
stand
round
fidgeting
,
dancing
,
with
the
overflow
of
energy
that
was
*NL*
in
him
.
If
he
were
working
in
a
line
of
men
,
the
line
always
moved
*NL*
too
slowly
for
him
,
and
you
could
pick
him
out
by
his
impatience
and
*NL*
restlessness
.
That
was
why
he
had
been
picked
out
on
one
important
*NL*
occasion
;
for
Jurgis
had
stood
outside
of
Brown
and
Company
's
``
Central
*NL*
Time
Station
''
not
more
than
half
an
hour
,
the
second
day
of
his
arrival
*NL*
in
Chicago
,
before
he
had
been
beckoned
by
one
of
the
bosses
.
Of
this
he
*NL*
was
very
proud
,
and
it
made
him
more
disposed
than
ever
to
laugh
at
the
*NL*
pessimists
.
In
vain
would
they
all
tell
him
that
there
were
men
in
that
*NL*
crowd
from
which
he
had
been
chosen
who
had
stood
there
a
month
--
yes
,
*NL*
many
months
--
and
not
been
chosen
yet
.
``
Yes
,
''
he
would
say
,
``
but
what
*NL*
sort
of
men
?
Broken-down
tramps
and
good-for-nothings
,
fellows
who
have
*NL*
spent
all
their
money
drinking
,
and
want
to
get
more
for
it
.
Do
you
want
*NL*
me
to
believe
that
with
these
arms
''
--
and
he
would
clench
his
fists
and
*NL*
hold
them
up
in
the
air
,
so
that
you
might
see
the
rolling
muscles
--
``
that
*NL*
with
these
arms
people
will
ever
let
me
starve
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
plain
,
''
they
would
answer
to
this
,
``
that
you
have
come
from
the
*NL*
country
,
and
from
very
far
in
the
country
.
''
And
this
was
the
fact
,
for
*NL*
Jurgis
had
never
seen
a
city
,
and
scarcely
even
a
fair-sized
town
,
until
*NL*
he
had
set
out
to
make
his
fortune
in
the
world
and
earn
his
right
*NL*
to
Ona
.
His
father
,
and
his
father
's
father
before
him
,
and
as
many
*NL*
ancestors
back
as
legend
could
go
,
had
lived
in
that
part
of
Lithuania
*NL*
known
as
Brelovicz
,
the
Imperial
Forest
.
This
is
a
great
tract
of
a
*NL*
hundred
thousand
acres
,
which
from
time
immemorial
has
been
a
hunting
*NL*
preserve
of
the
nobility
.
There
are
a
very
few
peasants
settled
in
it
,
*NL*
holding
title
from
ancient
times
;
and
one
of
these
was
Antanas
Rudkus
,
*NL*
who
had
been
reared
himself
,
and
had
reared
his
children
in
turn
,
upon
*NL*
half
a
dozen
acres
of
cleared
land
in
the
midst
of
a
wilderness
.
There
*NL*
had
been
one
son
besides
Jurgis
,
and
one
sister
.
The
former
had
been
*NL*
drafted
into
the
army
;
that
had
been
over
ten
years
ago
,
but
since
that
*NL*
day
nothing
had
ever
been
heard
of
him
.
The
sister
was
married
,
and
her
*NL*
husband
had
bought
the
place
when
old
Antanas
had
decided
to
go
with
his
*NL*
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
nearly
a
year
and
a
half
ago
that
Jurgis
had
met
Ona
,
at
a
*NL*
horse
fair
a
hundred
miles
from
home
.
Jurgis
had
never
expected
to
get
*NL*
married
--
he
had
laughed
at
it
as
a
foolish
trap
for
a
man
to
walk
into
;
*NL*
but
here
,
without
ever
having
spoken
a
word
to
her
,
with
no
more
than
*NL*
the
exchange
of
half
a
dozen
smiles
,
he
found
himself
,
purple
in
the
*NL*
face
with
embarrassment
and
terror
,
asking
her
parents
to
sell
her
to
*NL*
him
for
his
wife
--
and
offering
his
father
's
two
horses
he
had
been
sent
*NL*
to
the
fair
to
sell
.
But
Ona
's
father
proved
as
a
rock
--
the
girl
was
yet
*NL*
a
child
,
and
he
was
a
rich
man
,
and
his
daughter
was
not
to
be
had
in
*NL*
that
way
.
So
Jurgis
went
home
with
a
heavy
heart
,
and
that
spring
and
*NL*
summer
toiled
and
tried
hard
to
forget
.
In
the
fall
,
after
the
harvest
*NL*
was
over
,
he
saw
that
it
would
not
do
,
and
tramped
the
full
fortnight
's
*NL*
journey
that
lay
between
him
and
Ona
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
found
an
unexpected
state
of
affairs
--
for
the
girl
's
father
had
died
,
*NL*
and
his
estate
was
tied
up
with
creditors
;
Jurgis
'
heart
leaped
as
he
*NL*
realized
that
now
the
prize
was
within
his
reach
.
There
was
Elzbieta
*NL*
Lukoszaite
,
Teta
,
or
Aunt
,
as
they
called
her
,
Ona
's
stepmother
,
and
*NL*
there
were
her
six
children
,
of
all
ages
.
There
was
also
her
brother
*NL*
Jonas
,
a
dried-up
little
man
who
had
worked
upon
the
farm
.
They
were
*NL*
people
of
great
consequence
,
as
it
seemed
to
Jurgis
,
fresh
out
of
the
*NL*
woods
;
Ona
knew
how
to
read
,
and
knew
many
other
things
that
he
did
*NL*
not
know
,
and
now
the
farm
had
been
sold
,
and
the
whole
family
was
*NL*
adrift
--
all
they
owned
in
the
world
being
about
seven
hundred
rubles
*NL*
which
is
half
as
many
dollars
.
They
would
have
had
three
times
that
,
but
*NL*
it
had
gone
to
court
,
and
the
judge
had
decided
against
them
,
and
it
had
*NL*
cost
the
balance
to
get
him
to
change
his
decision
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ona
might
have
married
and
left
them
,
but
she
would
not
,
for
she
loved
*NL*
Teta
Elzbieta
.
It
was
Jonas
who
suggested
that
they
all
go
to
America
,
*NL*
where
a
friend
of
his
had
gotten
rich
.
He
would
work
,
for
his
part
,
and
*NL*
the
women
would
work
,
and
some
of
the
children
,
doubtless
--
they
would
*NL*
live
somehow
.
Jurgis
,
too
,
had
heard
of
America
.
That
was
a
country
*NL*
where
,
they
said
,
a
man
might
earn
three
rubles
a
day
;
and
Jurgis
*NL*
figured
what
three
rubles
a
day
would
mean
,
with
prices
as
they
were
*NL*
where
he
lived
,
and
decided
forthwith
that
he
would
go
to
America
and
*NL*
marry
,
and
be
a
rich
man
in
the
bargain
.
In
that
country
,
rich
or
poor
,
*NL*
a
man
was
free
,
it
was
said
;
he
did
not
have
to
go
into
the
army
,
he
did
*NL*
not
have
to
pay
out
his
money
to
rascally
officials
--
he
might
do
as
he
*NL*
pleased
,
and
count
himself
as
good
as
any
other
man
.
So
America
was
a
*NL*
place
of
which
lovers
and
young
people
dreamed
.
If
one
could
only
manage
*NL*
to
get
the
price
of
a
passage
,
he
could
count
his
troubles
at
an
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
arranged
that
they
should
leave
the
following
spring
,
and
*NL*
meantime
Jurgis
sold
himself
to
a
contractor
for
a
certain
time
,
and
*NL*
tramped
nearly
four
hundred
miles
from
home
with
a
gang
of
men
to
work
*NL*
upon
a
railroad
in
Smolensk
.
This
was
a
fearful
experience
,
with
filth
*NL*
and
bad
food
and
cruelty
and
overwork
;
but
Jurgis
stood
it
and
came
out
*NL*
in
fine
trim
,
and
with
eighty
rubles
sewed
up
in
his
coat
.
He
did
not
*NL*
drink
or
fight
,
because
he
was
thinking
all
the
time
of
Ona
;
and
for
the
*NL*
rest
,
he
was
a
quiet
,
steady
man
,
who
did
what
he
was
told
to
,
did
not
*NL*
lose
his
temper
often
,
and
when
he
did
lose
it
made
the
offender
anxious
*NL*
that
he
should
not
lose
it
again
.
When
they
paid
him
off
he
dodged
the
*NL*
company
gamblers
and
dramshops
,
and
so
they
tried
to
kill
him
;
but
he
*NL*
escaped
,
and
tramped
it
home
,
working
at
odd
jobs
,
and
sleeping
always
*NL*
with
one
eye
open
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
in
the
summer
time
they
had
all
set
out
for
America
.
At
the
last
*NL*
moment
there
joined
them
Marija
Berczynskas
,
who
was
a
cousin
of
Ona
's
.
*NL*
Marija
was
an
orphan
,
and
had
worked
since
childhood
for
a
rich
farmer
*NL*
of
Vilna
,
who
beat
her
regularly
.
It
was
only
at
the
age
of
twenty
that
*NL*
it
had
occurred
to
Marija
to
try
her
strength
,
when
she
had
risen
up
and
*NL*
nearly
murdered
the
man
,
and
then
come
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
twelve
in
all
in
the
party
,
five
adults
and
six
children
--
and
*NL*
Ona
,
who
was
a
little
of
both
.
They
had
a
hard
time
on
the
passage
;
*NL*
there
was
an
agent
who
helped
them
,
but
he
proved
a
scoundrel
,
and
got
*NL*
them
into
a
trap
with
some
officials
,
and
cost
them
a
good
deal
of
*NL*
their
precious
money
,
which
they
clung
to
with
such
horrible
fear
.
This
*NL*
happened
to
them
again
in
New
York
--
for
,
of
course
,
they
knew
nothing
*NL*
about
the
country
,
and
had
no
one
to
tell
them
,
and
it
was
easy
for
a
*NL*
man
in
a
blue
uniform
to
lead
them
away
,
and
to
take
them
to
a
hotel
and
*NL*
keep
them
there
,
and
make
them
pay
enormous
charges
to
get
away
.
The
law
*NL*
says
that
the
rate
card
shall
be
on
the
door
of
a
hotel
,
but
it
does
not
*NL*
say
that
it
shall
be
in
Lithuanian
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
the
stockyards
that
Jonas
'
friend
had
gotten
rich
,
and
so
to
*NL*
Chicago
the
party
was
bound
.
They
knew
that
one
word
,
Chicago
and
that
*NL*
was
all
they
needed
to
know
,
at
least
,
until
they
reached
the
city
.
*NL*
Then
,
tumbled
out
of
the
cars
without
ceremony
,
they
were
no
better
off
*NL*
than
before
;
they
stood
staring
down
the
vista
of
Dearborn
Street
,
with
*NL*
its
big
black
buildings
towering
in
the
distance
,
unable
to
realize
that
*NL*
they
had
arrived
,
and
why
,
when
they
said
``
Chicago
,
''
people
no
longer
*NL*
pointed
in
some
direction
,
but
instead
looked
perplexed
,
or
laughed
,
*NL*
or
went
on
without
paying
any
attention
.
They
were
pitiable
in
their
*NL*
helplessness
;
above
all
things
they
stood
in
deadly
terror
of
any
sort
*NL*
of
person
in
official
uniform
,
and
so
whenever
they
saw
a
policeman
they
*NL*
would
cross
the
street
and
hurry
by
.
For
the
whole
of
the
first
day
they
*NL*
wandered
about
in
the
midst
of
deafening
confusion
,
utterly
lost
;
and
*NL*
it
was
only
at
night
that
,
cowering
in
the
doorway
of
a
house
,
they
*NL*
were
finally
discovered
and
taken
by
a
policeman
to
the
station
.
In
the
*NL*
morning
an
interpreter
was
found
,
and
they
were
taken
and
put
upon
a
*NL*
car
,
and
taught
a
new
word
--
``
stockyards
.
''
Their
delight
at
discovering
*NL*
that
they
were
to
get
out
of
this
adventure
without
losing
another
share
*NL*
of
their
possessions
it
would
not
be
possible
to
describe
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
sat
and
stared
out
of
the
window
.
They
were
on
a
street
which
*NL*
seemed
to
run
on
forever
,
mile
after
mile
--
thirty-four
of
them
,
if
they
*NL*
had
known
it
--
and
each
side
of
it
one
uninterrupted
row
of
wretched
*NL*
little
two-story
frame
buildings
.
Down
every
side
street
they
could
see
,
*NL*
it
was
the
same
--
never
a
hill
and
never
a
hollow
,
but
always
the
same
*NL*
endless
vista
of
ugly
and
dirty
little
wooden
buildings
.
Here
and
there
*NL*
would
be
a
bridge
crossing
a
filthy
creek
,
with
hard-baked
mud
shores
*NL*
and
dingy
sheds
and
docks
along
it
;
here
and
there
would
be
a
railroad
*NL*
crossing
,
with
a
tangle
of
switches
,
and
locomotives
puffing
,
and
*NL*
rattling
freight
cars
filing
by
;
here
and
there
would
be
a
great
*NL*
factory
,
a
dingy
building
with
innumerable
windows
in
it
,
and
immense
*NL*
volumes
of
smoke
pouring
from
the
chimneys
,
darkening
the
air
above
and
*NL*
making
filthy
the
earth
beneath
.
But
after
each
of
these
interruptions
,
*NL*
the
desolate
procession
would
begin
again
--
the
procession
of
dreary
*NL*
little
buildings
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
full
hour
before
the
party
reached
the
city
they
had
begun
to
note
the
*NL*
perplexing
changes
in
the
atmosphere
.
It
grew
darker
all
the
time
,
and
*NL*
upon
the
earth
the
grass
seemed
to
grow
less
green
.
Every
minute
,
as
*NL*
the
train
sped
on
,
the
colors
of
things
became
dingier
;
the
fields
were
*NL*
grown
parched
and
yellow
,
the
landscape
hideous
and
bare
.
And
along
*NL*
with
the
thickening
smoke
they
began
to
notice
another
circumstance
,
a
*NL*
strange
,
pungent
odor
.
They
were
not
sure
that
it
was
unpleasant
,
this
*NL*
odor
;
some
might
have
called
it
sickening
,
but
their
taste
in
odors
was
*NL*
not
developed
,
and
they
were
only
sure
that
it
was
curious
.
Now
,
sitting
*NL*
in
the
trolley
car
,
they
realized
that
they
were
on
their
way
to
the
*NL*
home
of
it
--
that
they
had
traveled
all
the
way
from
Lithuania
to
it
.
*NL*
It
was
now
no
longer
something
far
off
and
faint
,
that
you
caught
in
*NL*
whiffs
;
you
could
literally
taste
it
,
as
well
as
smell
it
--
you
could
*NL*
take
hold
of
it
,
almost
,
and
examine
it
at
your
leisure
.
They
were
*NL*
divided
in
their
opinions
about
it
.
It
was
an
elemental
odor
,
raw
and
*NL*
crude
;
it
was
rich
,
almost
rancid
,
sensual
,
and
strong
.
There
were
some
*NL*
who
drank
it
in
as
if
it
were
an
intoxicant
;
there
were
others
who
put
*NL*
their
handkerchiefs
to
their
faces
.
The
new
emigrants
were
still
tasting
*NL*
it
,
lost
in
wonder
,
when
suddenly
the
car
came
to
a
halt
,
and
the
door
*NL*
was
flung
open
,
and
a
voice
shouted
--
``
Stockyards
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
left
standing
upon
the
corner
,
staring
;
down
a
side
street
*NL*
there
were
two
rows
of
brick
houses
,
and
between
them
a
vista
:
half
*NL*
a
dozen
chimneys
,
tall
as
the
tallest
of
buildings
,
touching
the
very
*NL*
sky
--
and
leaping
from
them
half
a
dozen
columns
of
smoke
,
thick
,
oily
,
*NL*
and
black
as
night
.
It
might
have
come
from
the
center
of
the
world
,
*NL*
this
smoke
,
where
the
fires
of
the
ages
still
smolder
.
It
came
as
if
*NL*
self-impelled
,
driving
all
before
it
,
a
perpetual
explosion
.
It
was
*NL*
inexhaustible
;
one
stared
,
waiting
to
see
it
stop
,
but
still
the
great
*NL*
streams
rolled
out
.
They
spread
in
vast
clouds
overhead
,
writhing
,
*NL*
curling
;
then
,
uniting
in
one
giant
river
,
they
streamed
away
down
the
*NL*
sky
,
stretching
a
black
pall
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
party
became
aware
of
another
strange
thing
.
This
,
too
,
like
*NL*
the
color
,
was
a
thing
elemental
;
it
was
a
sound
,
a
sound
made
up
of
ten
*NL*
thousand
little
sounds
.
You
scarcely
noticed
it
at
first
--
it
sunk
into
*NL*
your
consciousness
,
a
vague
disturbance
,
a
trouble
.
It
was
like
the
*NL*
murmuring
of
the
bees
in
the
spring
,
the
whisperings
of
the
forest
;
it
*NL*
suggested
endless
activity
,
the
rumblings
of
a
world
in
motion
.
It
was
*NL*
only
by
an
effort
that
one
could
realize
that
it
was
made
by
animals
,
*NL*
that
it
was
the
distant
lowing
of
ten
thousand
cattle
,
the
distant
*NL*
grunting
of
ten
thousand
swine
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
would
have
liked
to
follow
it
up
,
but
,
alas
,
they
had
no
time
for
*NL*
adventures
just
then
.
The
policeman
on
the
corner
was
beginning
to
watch
*NL*
them
;
and
so
,
as
usual
,
they
started
up
the
street
.
Scarcely
had
they
*NL*
gone
a
block
,
however
,
before
Jonas
was
heard
to
give
a
cry
,
and
began
*NL*
pointing
excitedly
across
the
street
.
Before
they
could
gather
the
*NL*
meaning
of
his
breathless
ejaculations
he
had
bounded
away
,
and
they
saw
*NL*
him
enter
a
shop
,
over
which
was
a
sign
:
``
J.
Szedvilas
,
Delicatessen
.
''
*NL*
When
he
came
out
again
it
was
in
company
with
a
very
stout
gentleman
in
*NL*
shirt
sleeves
and
an
apron
,
clasping
Jonas
by
both
hands
and
laughing
*NL*
hilariously
.
Then
Teta
Elzbieta
recollected
suddenly
that
Szedvilas
*NL*
had
been
the
name
of
the
mythical
friend
who
had
made
his
fortune
in
*NL*
America
.
To
find
that
he
had
been
making
it
in
the
delicatessen
business
*NL*
was
an
extraordinary
piece
of
good
fortune
at
this
juncture
;
though
it
*NL*
was
well
on
in
the
morning
,
they
had
not
breakfasted
,
and
the
children
*NL*
were
beginning
to
whimper
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
was
the
happy
ending
to
a
woeful
voyage
.
The
two
families
literally
*NL*
fell
upon
each
other
's
necks
--
for
it
had
been
years
since
Jokubas
*NL*
Szedvilas
had
met
a
man
from
his
part
of
Lithuania
.
Before
half
the
day
*NL*
they
were
lifelong
friends
.
Jokubas
understood
all
the
pitfalls
of
this
*NL*
new
world
,
and
could
explain
all
of
its
mysteries
;
he
could
tell
them
*NL*
the
things
they
ought
to
have
done
in
the
different
emergencies
--
and
*NL*
what
was
still
more
to
the
point
,
he
could
tell
them
what
to
do
now
.
He
*NL*
would
take
them
to
poni
Aniele
,
who
kept
a
boardinghouse
the
other
side
*NL*
of
the
yards
;
old
Mrs.
Jukniene
,
he
explained
,
had
not
what
one
would
*NL*
call
choice
accommodations
,
but
they
might
do
for
the
moment
.
To
this
*NL*
Teta
Elzbieta
hastened
to
respond
that
nothing
could
be
too
cheap
to
*NL*
suit
them
just
then
;
for
they
were
quite
terrified
over
the
sums
they
*NL*
had
had
to
expend
.
A
very
few
days
of
practical
experience
in
this
land
*NL*
of
high
wages
had
been
sufficient
to
make
clear
to
them
the
cruel
fact
*NL*
that
it
was
also
a
land
of
high
prices
,
and
that
in
it
the
poor
man
*NL*
was
almost
as
poor
as
in
any
other
corner
of
the
earth
;
and
so
there
*NL*
vanished
in
a
night
all
the
wonderful
dreams
of
wealth
that
had
been
*NL*
haunting
Jurgis
.
What
had
made
the
discovery
all
the
more
painful
was
*NL*
that
they
were
spending
,
at
American
prices
,
money
which
they
had
earned
*NL*
at
home
rates
of
wages
--
and
so
were
really
being
cheated
by
the
world
!
*NL*
The
last
two
days
they
had
all
but
starved
themselves
--
it
made
them
*NL*
quite
sick
to
pay
the
prices
that
the
railroad
people
asked
them
for
*NL*
food
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
,
when
they
saw
the
home
of
the
Widow
Jukniene
they
could
not
but
*NL*
recoil
,
even
so
,
in
all
their
journey
they
had
seen
nothing
so
bad
as
*NL*
this
.
Poni
Aniele
had
a
four-room
flat
in
one
of
that
wilderness
of
*NL*
two-story
frame
tenements
that
lie
``
back
of
the
yards
.
''
There
were
four
*NL*
such
flats
in
each
building
,
and
each
of
the
four
was
a
``
boardinghouse
''
*NL*
for
the
occupancy
of
foreigners
--
Lithuanians
,
Poles
,
Slovaks
,
or
*NL*
Bohemians
.
Some
of
these
places
were
kept
by
private
persons
,
some
were
*NL*
cooperative
.
There
would
be
an
average
of
half
a
dozen
boarders
to
each
*NL*
room
--
sometimes
there
were
thirteen
or
fourteen
to
one
room
,
fifty
*NL*
or
sixty
to
a
flat
.
Each
one
of
the
occupants
furnished
his
own
*NL*
accommodations
--
that
is
,
a
mattress
and
some
bedding
.
The
mattresses
*NL*
would
be
spread
upon
the
floor
in
rows
--
and
there
would
be
nothing
else
*NL*
in
the
place
except
a
stove
.
It
was
by
no
means
unusual
for
two
men
*NL*
to
own
the
same
mattress
in
common
,
one
working
by
day
and
using
it
by
*NL*
night
,
and
the
other
working
at
night
and
using
it
in
the
daytime
.
Very
*NL*
frequently
a
lodging
house
keeper
would
rent
the
same
beds
to
double
*NL*
shifts
of
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Jukniene
was
a
wizened-up
little
woman
,
with
a
wrinkled
face
.
Her
*NL*
home
was
unthinkably
filthy
;
you
could
not
enter
by
the
front
door
at
*NL*
all
,
owing
to
the
mattresses
,
and
when
you
tried
to
go
up
the
backstairs
*NL*
you
found
that
she
had
walled
up
most
of
the
porch
with
old
boards
*NL*
to
make
a
place
to
keep
her
chickens
.
It
was
a
standing
jest
of
the
*NL*
boarders
that
Aniele
cleaned
house
by
letting
the
chickens
loose
in
*NL*
the
rooms
.
Undoubtedly
this
did
keep
down
the
vermin
,
but
it
seemed
*NL*
probable
,
in
view
of
all
the
circumstances
,
that
the
old
lady
regarded
*NL*
it
rather
as
feeding
the
chickens
than
as
cleaning
the
rooms
.
The
truth
*NL*
was
that
she
had
definitely
given
up
the
idea
of
cleaning
anything
,
*NL*
under
pressure
of
an
attack
of
rheumatism
,
which
had
kept
her
doubled
up
*NL*
in
one
corner
of
her
room
for
over
a
week
;
during
which
time
eleven
of
*NL*
her
boarders
,
heavily
in
her
debt
,
had
concluded
to
try
their
chances
of
*NL*
employment
in
Kansas
City
.
This
was
July
,
and
the
fields
were
green
.
One
*NL*
never
saw
the
fields
,
nor
any
green
thing
whatever
,
in
Packingtown
;
but
*NL*
one
could
go
out
on
the
road
and
``
hobo
it
,
''
as
the
men
phrased
it
,
and
*NL*
see
the
country
,
and
have
a
long
rest
,
and
an
easy
time
riding
on
the
*NL*
freight
cars
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
the
home
to
which
the
new
arrivals
were
welcomed
.
There
was
*NL*
nothing
better
to
be
had
--
they
might
not
do
so
well
by
looking
further
,
*NL*
for
Mrs.
Jukniene
had
at
least
kept
one
room
for
herself
and
her
three
*NL*
little
children
,
and
now
offered
to
share
this
with
the
women
and
the
*NL*
girls
of
the
party
.
They
could
get
bedding
at
a
secondhand
store
,
*NL*
she
explained
;
and
they
would
not
need
any
,
while
the
weather
was
so
*NL*
hot
--
doubtless
they
would
all
sleep
on
the
sidewalk
such
nights
as
this
,
*NL*
as
did
nearly
all
of
her
guests
.
``
Tomorrow
,
''
Jurgis
said
,
when
they
were
*NL*
left
alone
,
``
tomorrow
I
will
get
a
job
,
and
perhaps
Jonas
will
get
one
*NL*
also
;
and
then
we
can
get
a
place
of
our
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Later
that
afternoon
he
and
Ona
went
out
to
take
a
walk
and
look
about
*NL*
them
,
to
see
more
of
this
district
which
was
to
be
their
home
.
In
back
*NL*
of
the
yards
the
dreary
two-story
frame
houses
were
scattered
farther
*NL*
apart
,
and
there
were
great
spaces
bare
--
that
seemingly
had
been
*NL*
overlooked
by
the
great
sore
of
a
city
as
it
spread
itself
over
the
*NL*
surface
of
the
prairie
.
These
bare
places
were
grown
up
with
dingy
,
*NL*
yellow
weeds
,
hiding
innumerable
tomato
cans
;
innumerable
children
*NL*
played
upon
them
,
chasing
one
another
here
and
there
,
screaming
and
*NL*
fighting
.
The
most
uncanny
thing
about
this
neighborhood
was
the
number
*NL*
of
the
children
;
you
thought
there
must
be
a
school
just
out
,
and
it
was
*NL*
only
after
long
acquaintance
that
you
were
able
to
realize
that
*NL*
there
was
no
school
,
but
that
these
were
the
children
of
the
*NL*
neighborhood
--
that
there
were
so
many
children
to
the
block
in
*NL*
Packingtown
that
nowhere
on
its
streets
could
a
horse
and
buggy
move
*NL*
faster
than
a
walk
!
*NL*
*NL*
It
could
not
move
faster
anyhow
,
on
account
of
the
state
of
the
streets
.
*NL*
Those
through
which
Jurgis
and
Ona
were
walking
resembled
streets
less
*NL*
than
they
did
a
miniature
topographical
map
.
The
roadway
was
commonly
*NL*
several
feet
lower
than
the
level
of
the
houses
,
which
were
sometimes
*NL*
joined
by
high
board
walks
;
there
were
no
pavements
--
there
were
*NL*
mountains
and
valleys
and
rivers
,
gullies
and
ditches
,
and
great
hollows
*NL*
full
of
stinking
green
water
.
In
these
pools
the
children
played
,
and
*NL*
rolled
about
in
the
mud
of
the
streets
;
here
and
there
one
noticed
them
*NL*
digging
in
it
,
after
trophies
which
they
had
stumbled
on
.
One
wondered
*NL*
about
this
,
as
also
about
the
swarms
of
flies
which
hung
about
the
*NL*
scene
,
literally
blackening
the
air
,
and
the
strange
,
fetid
odor
which
*NL*
assailed
one
's
nostrils
,
a
ghastly
odor
,
of
all
the
dead
things
of
the
*NL*
universe
.
It
impelled
the
visitor
to
questions
and
then
the
residents
*NL*
would
explain
,
quietly
,
that
all
this
was
``
made
''
land
,
and
that
it
had
*NL*
been
``
made
''
by
using
it
as
a
dumping
ground
for
the
city
garbage
.
After
*NL*
a
few
years
the
unpleasant
effect
of
this
would
pass
away
,
it
was
said
;
*NL*
but
meantime
,
in
hot
weather
--
and
especially
when
it
rained
--
the
flies
*NL*
were
apt
to
be
annoying
.
Was
it
not
unhealthful
?
the
stranger
would
ask
,
*NL*
and
the
residents
would
answer
,
``
Perhaps
;
but
there
is
no
telling
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
little
way
farther
on
,
and
Jurgis
and
Ona
,
staring
open-eyed
and
*NL*
wondering
,
came
to
the
place
where
this
``
made
''
ground
was
in
process
of
*NL*
making
.
Here
was
a
great
hole
,
perhaps
two
city
blocks
square
,
and
with
*NL*
long
files
of
garbage
wagons
creeping
into
it
.
The
place
had
an
odor
*NL*
for
which
there
are
no
polite
words
;
and
it
was
sprinkled
over
with
*NL*
children
,
who
raked
in
it
from
dawn
till
dark
.
Sometimes
visitors
from
*NL*
the
packing
houses
would
wander
out
to
see
this
``
dump
,
''
and
they
would
*NL*
stand
by
and
debate
as
to
whether
the
children
were
eating
the
food
they
*NL*
got
,
or
merely
collecting
it
for
the
chickens
at
home
.
Apparently
none
*NL*
of
them
ever
went
down
to
find
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beyond
this
dump
there
stood
a
great
brickyard
,
with
smoking
chimneys
.
*NL*
First
they
took
out
the
soil
to
make
bricks
,
and
then
they
filled
it
*NL*
up
again
with
garbage
,
which
seemed
to
Jurgis
and
Ona
a
felicitous
*NL*
arrangement
,
characteristic
of
an
enterprising
country
like
America
.
A
*NL*
little
way
beyond
was
another
great
hole
,
which
they
had
emptied
and
not
*NL*
yet
filled
up
.
This
held
water
,
and
all
summer
it
stood
there
,
with
the
*NL*
near-by
soil
draining
into
it
,
festering
and
stewing
in
the
sun
;
and
*NL*
then
,
when
winter
came
,
somebody
cut
the
ice
on
it
,
and
sold
it
to
the
*NL*
people
of
the
city
.
This
,
too
,
seemed
to
the
newcomers
an
economical
*NL*
arrangement
;
for
they
did
not
read
the
newspapers
,
and
their
heads
were
*NL*
not
full
of
troublesome
thoughts
about
``
germs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
stood
there
while
the
sun
went
down
upon
this
scene
,
and
the
sky
in
*NL*
the
west
turned
blood-red
,
and
the
tops
of
the
houses
shone
like
fire
.
*NL*
Jurgis
and
Ona
were
not
thinking
of
the
sunset
,
however
--
their
backs
*NL*
were
turned
to
it
,
and
all
their
thoughts
were
of
Packingtown
,
which
*NL*
they
could
see
so
plainly
in
the
distance
.
The
line
of
the
buildings
*NL*
stood
clear-cut
and
black
against
the
sky
;
here
and
there
out
of
the
*NL*
mass
rose
the
great
chimneys
,
with
the
river
of
smoke
streaming
away
to
*NL*
the
end
of
the
world
.
It
was
a
study
in
colors
now
,
this
smoke
;
in
the
*NL*
sunset
light
it
was
black
and
brown
and
gray
and
purple
.
All
the
sordid
*NL*
suggestions
of
the
place
were
gone
--
in
the
twilight
it
was
a
vision
of
*NL*
power
.
To
the
two
who
stood
watching
while
the
darkness
swallowed
it
up
,
*NL*
it
seemed
a
dream
of
wonder
,
with
its
talc
of
human
energy
,
of
things
*NL*
being
done
,
of
employment
for
thousands
upon
thousands
of
men
,
of
*NL*
opportunity
and
freedom
,
of
life
and
love
and
joy
.
When
they
came
away
,
*NL*
arm
in
arm
,
Jurgis
was
saying
,
``
Tomorrow
I
shall
go
there
and
get
a
*NL*
job
!

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
his
capacity
as
delicatessen
vender
,
Jokubas
Szedvilas
had
many
*NL*
acquaintances
.
Among
these
was
one
of
the
special
policemen
employed
*NL*
by
Durham
,
whose
duty
it
frequently
was
to
pick
out
men
for
employment
.
*NL*
Jokubas
had
never
tried
it
,
but
he
expressed
a
certainty
that
he
could
*NL*
get
some
of
his
friends
a
job
through
this
man
.
It
was
agreed
,
after
*NL*
consultation
,
that
he
should
make
the
effort
with
old
Antanas
and
with
*NL*
Jonas
.
Jurgis
was
confident
of
his
ability
to
get
work
for
himself
,
*NL*
unassisted
by
any
one
.
As
we
have
said
before
,
he
was
not
mistaken
in
*NL*
this
.
He
had
gone
to
Brown
's
and
stood
there
not
more
than
half
an
hour
*NL*
before
one
of
the
bosses
noticed
his
form
towering
above
the
rest
,
and
*NL*
signaled
to
him
.
The
colloquy
which
followed
was
brief
and
to
the
point
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak
English
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
Lit-uanian
.
''
-LRB-
Jurgis
had
studied
this
word
carefully
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
Signals
and

on
the
part
of
the
boss
.
Vigorous

*NL*
the

Thank

-RRB-
And
that
was
all
.
Jurgis
turned
*NL*
away
,
and
then
in
a
sudden
rush
the
full
realization
of
his
triumph
*NL*
swept
over
him
,
and
he
gave
a
yell
and
a
jump
,
and
started
off
on
a
*NL*
run
.
He
had
a
job
!
He
had
a
job
!
And
he
went
all
the
way
home
as
if
*NL*
upon
wings
,
and
burst
into
the
house
like
a
cyclone
,
to
the
rage
of
the
*NL*
numerous
lodgers
who
had
just
turned
in
for
their
daily
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meantime
Jokubas
had
been
to
see
his
friend
the
policeman
,
and
received
*NL*
encouragement
,
so
it
was
a
happy
party
.
There
being
no
more
to
be
done
*NL*
that
day
,
the
shop
was
left
under
the
care
of
Lucija
,
and
her
husband
*NL*
sallied
forth
to
show
his
friends
the
sights
of
Packingtown
.
Jokubas
did
*NL*
this
with
the
air
of
a
country
gentleman
escorting
a
party
of
visitors
*NL*
over
his
estate
;
he
was
an
old-time
resident
,
and
all
these
wonders
*NL*
had
grown
up
under
his
eyes
,
and
he
had
a
personal
pride
in
them
.
The
*NL*
packers
might
own
the
land
,
but
he
claimed
the
landscape
,
and
there
was
*NL*
no
one
to
say
nay
to
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
They
passed
down
the
busy
street
that
led
to
the
yards
.
It
was
still
*NL*
early
morning
,
and
everything
was
at
its
high
tide
of
activity
.
A
steady
*NL*
stream
of
employees
was
pouring
through
the
gate
--
employees
of
the
*NL*
higher
sort
,
at
this
hour
,
clerks
and
stenographers
and
such
.
For
the
*NL*
women
there
were
waiting
big
two-horse
wagons
,
which
set
off
at
a
gallop
*NL*
as
fast
as
they
were
filled
.
In
the
distance
there
was
heard
again
*NL*
the
lowing
of
the
cattle
,
a
sound
as
of
a
far-off
ocean
calling
.
They
*NL*
followed
it
,
this
time
,
as
eager
as
children
in
sight
of
a
circus
*NL*
menagerie
--
which
,
indeed
,
the
scene
a
good
deal
resembled
.
They
crossed
*NL*
the
railroad
tracks
,
and
then
on
each
side
of
the
street
were
the
pens
*NL*
full
of
cattle
;
they
would
have
stopped
to
look
,
but
Jokubas
hurried
*NL*
them
on
,
to
where
there
was
a
stairway
and
a
raised
gallery
,
from
which
*NL*
everything
could
be
seen
.
Here
they
stood
,
staring
,
breathless
with
*NL*
wonder
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
over
a
square
mile
of
space
in
the
yards
,
and
more
than
half
*NL*
of
it
is
occupied
by
cattle
pens
;
north
and
south
as
far
as
the
eye
can
*NL*
reach
there
stretches
a
sea
of
pens
.
And
they
were
all
filled
--
so
many
*NL*
cattle
no
one
had
ever
dreamed
existed
in
the
world
.
Red
cattle
,
black
,
*NL*
white
,
and
yellow
cattle
;
old
cattle
and
young
cattle
;
great
bellowing
*NL*
bulls
and
little
calves
not
an
hour
born
;
meek-eyed
milch
cows
and
*NL*
fierce
,
long-horned
Texas
steers
.
The
sound
of
them
here
was
as
of
all
*NL*
the
barnyards
of
the
universe
;
and
as
for
counting
them
--
it
would
have
*NL*
taken
all
day
simply
to
count
the
pens
.
Here
and
there
ran
long
alleys
,
*NL*
blocked
at
intervals
by
gates
;
and
Jokubas
told
them
that
the
number
of
*NL*
these
gates
was
twenty-five
thousand
.
Jokubas
had
recently
been
reading
*NL*
a
newspaper
article
which
was
full
of
statistics
such
as
that
,
and
he
*NL*
was
very
proud
as
he
repeated
them
and
made
his
guests
cry
out
with
*NL*
wonder
.
Jurgis
too
had
a
little
of
this
sense
of
pride
.
Had
he
not
just
*NL*
gotten
a
job
,
and
become
a
sharer
in
all
this
activity
,
a
cog
in
this
*NL*
marvelous
machine
?
Here
and
there
about
the
alleys
galloped
men
upon
*NL*
horseback
,
booted
,
and
carrying
long
whips
;
they
were
very
busy
,
calling
*NL*
to
each
other
,
and
to
those
who
were
driving
the
cattle
.
They
were
*NL*
drovers
and
stock
raisers
,
who
had
come
from
far
states
,
and
brokers
and
*NL*
commission
merchants
,
and
buyers
for
all
the
big
packing
houses
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
and
there
they
would
stop
to
inspect
a
bunch
of
cattle
,
and
there
*NL*
would
be
a
parley
,
brief
and
businesslike
.
The
buyer
would
nod
or
drop
*NL*
his
whip
,
and
that
would
mean
a
bargain
;
and
he
would
note
it
in
his
*NL*
little
book
,
along
with
hundreds
of
others
he
had
made
that
morning
.
*NL*
Then
Jokubas
pointed
out
the
place
where
the
cattle
were
driven
to
be
*NL*
weighed
,
upon
a
great
scale
that
would
weigh
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
*NL*
at
once
and
record
it
automatically
.
It
was
near
to
the
east
entrance
*NL*
that
they
stood
,
and
all
along
this
east
side
of
the
yards
ran
the
*NL*
railroad
tracks
,
into
which
the
cars
were
run
,
loaded
with
cattle
.
*NL*
All
night
long
this
had
been
going
on
,
and
now
the
pens
were
full
;
by
*NL*
tonight
they
would
all
be
empty
,
and
the
same
thing
would
be
done
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
will
become
of
all
these
creatures
?
''
cried
Teta
Elzbieta
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
tonight
,
''
Jokubas
answered
,
``
they
will
all
be
killed
and
cut
up
;
*NL*
and
over
there
on
the
other
side
of
the
packing
houses
are
more
railroad
*NL*
tracks
,
where
the
cars
come
to
take
them
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
two
hundred
and
fifty
miles
of
track
within
the
yards
,
their
*NL*
guide
went
on
to
tell
them
.
They
brought
about
ten
thousand
head
of
*NL*
cattle
every
day
,
and
as
many
hogs
,
and
half
as
many
sheep
--
which
meant
*NL*
some
eight
or
ten
million
live
creatures
turned
into
food
every
year
.
*NL*
One
stood
and
watched
,
and
little
by
little
caught
the
drift
of
the
*NL*
tide
,
as
it
set
in
the
direction
of
the
packing
houses
.
There
were
*NL*
groups
of
cattle
being
driven
to
the
chutes
,
which
were
roadways
about
*NL*
fifteen
feet
wide
,
raised
high
above
the
pens
.
In
these
chutes
the
*NL*
stream
of
animals
was
continuous
;
it
was
quite
uncanny
to
watch
them
,
*NL*
pressing
on
to
their
fate
,
all
unsuspicious
a
very
river
of
death
.
Our
*NL*
friends
were
not
poetical
,
and
the
sight
suggested
to
them
no
metaphors
*NL*
of
human
destiny
;
they
thought
only
of
the
wonderful
efficiency
of
it
*NL*
all
.
The
chutes
into
which
the
hogs
went
climbed
high
up
--
to
the
very
*NL*
top
of
the
distant
buildings
;
and
Jokubas
explained
that
the
hogs
went
*NL*
up
by
the
power
of
their
own
legs
,
and
then
their
weight
carried
them
*NL*
back
through
all
the
processes
necessary
to
make
them
into
pork
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
do
n't
waste
anything
here
,
''
said
the
guide
,
and
then
he
laughed
*NL*
and
added
a
witticism
,
which
he
was
pleased
that
his
unsophisticated
*NL*
friends
should
take
to
be
his
own
:
``
They
use
everything
about
the
hog
*NL*
except
the
squeal
.
''
In
front
of
Brown
's
General
Office
building
there
*NL*
grows
a
tiny
plot
of
grass
,
and
this
,
you
may
learn
,
is
the
only
bit
*NL*
of
green
thing
in
Packingtown
;
likewise
this
jest
about
the
hog
and
his
*NL*
squeal
,
the
stock
in
trade
of
all
the
guides
,
is
the
one
gleam
of
humor
*NL*
that
you
will
find
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
they
had
seen
enough
of
the
pens
,
the
party
went
up
the
street
,
*NL*
to
the
mass
of
buildings
which
occupy
the
center
of
the
yards
.
These
*NL*
buildings
,
made
of
brick
and
stained
with
innumerable
layers
of
*NL*
Packingtown
smoke
,
were
painted
all
over
with
advertising
signs
,
from
*NL*
which
the
visitor
realized
suddenly
that
he
had
come
to
the
home
of
many
*NL*
of
the
torments
of
his
life
.
It
was
here
that
they
made
those
products
*NL*
with
the
wonders
of
which
they
pestered
him
so
--
by
placards
that
defaced
*NL*
the
landscape
when
he
traveled
,
and
by
staring
advertisements
in
the
*NL*
newspapers
and
magazines
--
by
silly
little
jingles
that
he
could
not
get
*NL*
out
of
his
mind
,
and
gaudy
pictures
that
lurked
for
him
around
every
*NL*
street
corner
.
Here
was
where
they
made
Brown
's
Imperial
Hams
and
*NL*
Bacon
,
Brown
's
Dressed
Beef
,
Brown
's
Excelsior
Sausages
!
Here
was
the
*NL*
headquarters
of
Durham
's
Pure
Leaf
Lard
,
of
Durham
's
Breakfast
Bacon
,
*NL*
Durham
's
Canned
Beef
,
Potted
Ham
,
Deviled
Chicken
,
Peerless
Fertilizer
!
*NL*
*NL*
Entering
one
of
the
Durham
buildings
,
they
found
a
number
of
other
*NL*
visitors
waiting
;
and
before
long
there
came
a
guide
,
to
escort
them
*NL*
through
the
place
.
They
make
a
great
feature
of
showing
strangers
*NL*
through
the
packing
plants
,
for
it
is
a
good
advertisement
.
But
Ponas
*NL*
Jokubas
whispered
maliciously
that
the
visitors
did
not
see
any
more
*NL*
than
the
packers
wanted
them
to
.
They
climbed
a
long
series
of
stairways
*NL*
outside
of
the
building
,
to
the
top
of
its
five
or
six
stories
.
Here
was
*NL*
the
chute
,
with
its
river
of
hogs
,
all
patiently
toiling
upward
;
there
*NL*
was
a
place
for
them
to
rest
to
cool
off
,
and
then
through
another
*NL*
passageway
they
went
into
a
room
from
which
there
is
no
returning
for
*NL*
hogs
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
long
,
narrow
room
,
with
a
gallery
along
it
for
visitors
.
At
the
*NL*
head
there
was
a
great
iron
wheel
,
about
twenty
feet
in
circumference
,
*NL*
with
rings
here
and
there
along
its
edge
.
Upon
both
sides
of
this
wheel
*NL*
there
was
a
narrow
space
,
into
which
came
the
hogs
at
the
end
of
their
*NL*
journey
;
in
the
midst
of
them
stood
a
great
burly
Negro
,
bare-armed
and
*NL*
bare-chested
.
He
was
resting
for
the
moment
,
for
the
wheel
had
stopped
*NL*
while
men
were
cleaning
up
.
In
a
minute
or
two
,
however
,
it
began
slowly
*NL*
to
revolve
,
and
then
the
men
upon
each
side
of
it
sprang
to
work
.
They
*NL*
had
chains
which
they
fastened
about
the
leg
of
the
nearest
hog
,
and
the
*NL*
other
end
of
the
chain
they
hooked
into
one
of
the
rings
upon
the
wheel
.
*NL*
So
,
as
the
wheel
turned
,
a
hog
was
suddenly
jerked
off
his
feet
and
*NL*
borne
aloft
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
instant
the
car
was
assailed
by
a
most
terrifying
shriek
;
*NL*
the
visitors
started
in
alarm
,
the
women
turned
pale
and
shrank
back
.
*NL*
The
shriek
was
followed
by
another
,
louder
and
yet
more
agonizing
--
for
*NL*
once
started
upon
that
journey
,
the
hog
never
came
back
;
at
the
top
of
*NL*
the
wheel
he
was
shunted
off
upon
a
trolley
,
and
went
sailing
down
the
*NL*
room
.
And
meantime
another
was
swung
up
,
and
then
another
,
and
another
,
*NL*
until
there
was
a
double
line
of
them
,
each
dangling
by
a
foot
and
*NL*
kicking
in
frenzy
--
and
squealing
.
The
uproar
was
appalling
,
perilous
*NL*
to
the
eardrums
;
one
feared
there
was
too
much
sound
for
the
room
to
*NL*
hold
--
that
the
walls
must
give
way
or
the
ceiling
crack
.
There
were
high
*NL*
squeals
and
low
squeals
,
grunts
,
and
wails
of
agony
;
there
would
come
a
*NL*
momentary
lull
,
and
then
a
fresh
outburst
,
louder
than
ever
,
surging
up
*NL*
to
a
deafening
climax
.
It
was
too
much
for
some
of
the
visitors
--
the
men
*NL*
would
look
at
each
other
,
laughing
nervously
,
and
the
women
would
stand
*NL*
with
hands
clenched
,
and
the
blood
rushing
to
their
faces
,
and
the
tears
*NL*
starting
in
their
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meantime
,
heedless
of
all
these
things
,
the
men
upon
the
floor
were
*NL*
going
about
their
work
.
Neither
squeals
of
hogs
nor
tears
of
visitors
*NL*
made
any
difference
to
them
;
one
by
one
they
hooked
up
the
hogs
,
and
*NL*
one
by
one
with
a
swift
stroke
they
slit
their
throats
.
There
was
a
long
*NL*
line
of
hogs
,
with
squeals
and
lifeblood
ebbing
away
together
;
until
at
*NL*
last
each
started
again
,
and
vanished
with
a
splash
into
a
huge
vat
of
*NL*
boiling
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
all
so
very
businesslike
that
one
watched
it
fascinated
.
It
was
*NL*
porkmaking
by
machinery
,
porkmaking
by
applied
mathematics
.
And
yet
*NL*
somehow
the
most
matter-of-fact
person
could
not
help
thinking
of
the
*NL*
hogs
;
they
were
so
innocent
,
they
came
so
very
trustingly
;
and
they
were
*NL*
so
very
human
in
their
protests
--
and
so
perfectly
within
their
rights
!
*NL*
They
had
done
nothing
to
deserve
it
;
and
it
was
adding
insult
to
injury
,
*NL*
as
the
thing
was
done
here
,
swinging
them
up
in
this
cold-blooded
,
*NL*
impersonal
way
,
without
a
pretense
of
apology
,
without
the
homage
of
*NL*
a
tear
.
Now
and
then
a
visitor
wept
,
to
be
sure
;
but
this
slaughtering
*NL*
machine
ran
on
,
visitors
or
no
visitors
.
It
was
like
some
horrible
crime
*NL*
committed
in
a
dungeon
,
all
unseen
and
unheeded
,
buried
out
of
sight
and
*NL*
of
memory
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
could
not
stand
and
watch
very
long
without
becoming
philosophical
,
*NL*
without
beginning
to
deal
in
symbols
and
similes
,
and
to
hear
the
hog
*NL*
squeal
of
the
universe
.
Was
it
permitted
to
believe
that
there
was
*NL*
nowhere
upon
the
earth
,
or
above
the
earth
,
a
heaven
for
hogs
,
where
*NL*
they
were
requited
for
all
this
suffering
?
Each
one
of
these
hogs
was
*NL*
a
separate
creature
.
Some
were
white
hogs
,
some
were
black
;
some
were
*NL*
brown
,
some
were
spotted
;
some
were
old
,
some
young
;
some
were
long
and
*NL*
lean
,
some
were
monstrous
.
And
each
of
them
had
an
individuality
of
his
*NL*
own
,
a
will
of
his
own
,
a
hope
and
a
heart
's
desire
;
each
was
full
*NL*
of
self-confidence
,
of
self-importance
,
and
a
sense
of
dignity
.
And
*NL*
trusting
and
strong
in
faith
he
had
gone
about
his
business
,
the
while
a
*NL*
black
shadow
hung
over
him
and
a
horrid
Fate
waited
in
his
pathway
.
*NL*
Now
suddenly
it
had
swooped
upon
him
,
and
had
seized
him
by
the
leg
.
*NL*
Relentless
,
remorseless
,
it
was
;
all
his
protests
,
his
screams
,
were
*NL*
nothing
to
it
--
it
did
its
cruel
will
with
him
,
as
if
his
wishes
,
his
*NL*
feelings
,
had
simply
no
existence
at
all
;
it
cut
his
throat
and
watched
*NL*
him
gasp
out
his
life
.
And
now
was
one
to
believe
that
there
was
nowhere
*NL*
a
god
of
hogs
,
to
whom
this
hog
personality
was
precious
,
to
whom
these
*NL*
hog
squeals
and
agonies
had
a
meaning
?
Who
would
take
this
hog
into
his
*NL*
arms
and
comfort
him
,
reward
him
for
his
work
well
done
,
and
show
him
*NL*
the
meaning
of
his
sacrifice
?
Perhaps
some
glimpse
of
all
this
was
in
*NL*
the
thoughts
of
our
humble-minded
Jurgis
,
as
he
turned
to
go
on
with
the
*NL*
rest
of
the
party
,
and
muttered
:
``
Dieve
--
but
I
'm
glad
I
'm
not
a
hog
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
carcass
hog
was
scooped
out
of
the
vat
by
machinery
,
and
then
it
*NL*
fell
to
the
second
floor
,
passing
on
the
way
through
a
wonderful
machine
*NL*
with
numerous
scrapers
,
which
adjusted
themselves
to
the
size
and
shape
*NL*
of
the
animal
,
and
sent
it
out
at
the
other
end
with
nearly
all
of
its
*NL*
bristles
removed
.
It
was
then
again
strung
up
by
machinery
,
and
sent
*NL*
upon
another
trolley
ride
;
this
time
passing
between
two
lines
of
men
,
*NL*
who
sat
upon
a
raised
platform
,
each
doing
a
certain
single
thing
to
*NL*
the
carcass
as
it
came
to
him
.
One
scraped
the
outside
of
a
leg
;
another
*NL*
scraped
the
inside
of
the
same
leg
.
One
with
a
swift
stroke
cut
the
*NL*
throat
;
another
with
two
swift
strokes
severed
the
head
,
which
fell
*NL*
to
the
floor
and
vanished
through
a
hole
.
Another
made
a
slit
down
*NL*
the
body
;
a
second
opened
the
body
wider
;
a
third
with
a
saw
cut
the
*NL*
breastbone
;
a
fourth
loosened
the
entrails
;
a
fifth
pulled
them
out
--
and
*NL*
they
also
slid
through
a
hole
in
the
floor
.
There
were
men
to
scrape
*NL*
each
side
and
men
to
scrape
the
back
;
there
were
men
to
clean
the
*NL*
carcass
inside
,
to
trim
it
and
wash
it
.
Looking
down
this
room
,
one
saw
,
*NL*
creeping
slowly
,
a
line
of
dangling
hogs
a
hundred
yards
in
length
;
and
*NL*
for
every
yard
there
was
a
man
,
working
as
if
a
demon
were
after
him
.
At
*NL*
the
end
of
this
hog
's
progress
every
inch
of
the
carcass
had
been
gone
*NL*
over
several
times
;
and
then
it
was
rolled
into
the
chilling
room
,
where
*NL*
it
stayed
for
twenty-four
hours
,
and
where
a
stranger
might
lose
himself
*NL*
in
a
forest
of
freezing
hogs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
the
carcass
was
admitted
here
,
however
,
it
had
to
pass
a
*NL*
government
inspector
,
who
sat
in
the
doorway
and
felt
of
the
glands
in
*NL*
the
neck
for
tuberculosis
.
This
government
inspector
did
not
have
the
*NL*
manner
of
a
man
who
was
worked
to
death
;
he
was
apparently
not
haunted
*NL*
by
a
fear
that
the
hog
might
get
by
him
before
he
had
finished
his
*NL*
testing
.
If
you
were
a
sociable
person
,
he
was
quite
willing
to
enter
*NL*
into
conversation
with
you
,
and
to
explain
to
you
the
deadly
nature
*NL*
of
the
ptomaines
which
are
found
in
tubercular
pork
;
and
while
he
was
*NL*
talking
with
you
you
could
hardly
be
so
ungrateful
as
to
notice
that
a
*NL*
dozen
carcasses
were
passing
him
untouched
.
This
inspector
wore
a
blue
*NL*
uniform
,
with
brass
buttons
,
and
he
gave
an
atmosphere
of
authority
to
*NL*
the
scene
,
and
,
as
it
were
,
put
the
stamp
of
official
approval
upon
the
*NL*
things
which
were
done
in
Durham
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
went
down
the
line
with
the
rest
of
the
visitors
,
staring
*NL*
open-mouthed
,
lost
in
wonder
.
He
had
dressed
hogs
himself
in
the
forest
*NL*
of
Lithuania
;
but
he
had
never
expected
to
live
to
see
one
hog
dressed
*NL*
by
several
hundred
men
.
It
was
like
a
wonderful
poem
to
him
,
and
he
*NL*
took
it
all
in
guilelessly
--
even
to
the
conspicuous
signs
demanding
*NL*
immaculate
cleanliness
of
the
employees
.
Jurgis
was
vexed
when
the
*NL*
cynical
Jokubas
translated
these
signs
with
sarcastic
comments
,
offering
*NL*
to
take
them
to
the
secret
rooms
where
the
spoiled
meats
went
to
be
*NL*
doctored
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
party
descended
to
the
next
floor
,
where
the
various
waste
materials
*NL*
were
treated
.
Here
came
the
entrails
,
to
be
scraped
and
washed
clean
for
*NL*
sausage
casings
;
men
and
women
worked
here
in
the
midst
of
a
sickening
*NL*
stench
,
which
caused
the
visitors
to
hasten
by
,
gasping
.
To
another
room
*NL*
came
all
the
scraps
to
be
``
tanked
,
''
which
meant
boiling
and
pumping
off
*NL*
the
grease
to
make
soap
and
lard
;
below
they
took
out
the
refuse
,
and
*NL*
this
,
too
,
was
a
region
in
which
the
visitors
did
not
linger
.
In
still
*NL*
other
places
men
were
engaged
in
cutting
up
the
carcasses
that
had
been
*NL*
through
the
chilling
rooms
.
First
there
were
the
``
splitters
,
''
the
most
*NL*
expert
workmen
in
the
plant
,
who
earned
as
high
as
fifty
cents
an
hour
,
*NL*
and
did
not
a
thing
all
day
except
chop
hogs
down
the
middle
.
Then
there
*NL*
were
``
cleaver
men
,
''
great
giants
with
muscles
of
iron
;
each
had
two
men
*NL*
to
attend
him
--
to
slide
the
half
carcass
in
front
of
him
on
the
table
,
*NL*
and
hold
it
while
he
chopped
it
,
and
then
turn
each
piece
so
that
he
*NL*
might
chop
it
once
more
.
His
cleaver
had
a
blade
about
two
feet
long
,
*NL*
and
he
never
made
but
one
cut
;
he
made
it
so
neatly
,
too
,
that
his
*NL*
implement
did
not
smite
through
and
dull
itself
--
there
was
just
enough
*NL*
force
for
a
perfect
cut
,
and
no
more
.
So
through
various
yawning
*NL*
holes
there
slipped
to
the
floor
below
--
to
one
room
hams
,
to
another
*NL*
forequarters
,
to
another
sides
of
pork
.
One
might
go
down
to
this
floor
*NL*
and
see
the
pickling
rooms
,
where
the
hams
were
put
into
vats
,
and
the
*NL*
great
smoke
rooms
,
with
their
airtight
iron
doors
.
In
other
rooms
they
*NL*
prepared
salt
pork
--
there
were
whole
cellars
full
of
it
,
built
up
in
*NL*
great
towers
to
the
ceiling
.
In
yet
other
rooms
they
were
putting
up
*NL*
meats
in
boxes
and
barrels
,
and
wrapping
hams
and
bacon
in
oiled
paper
,
*NL*
sealing
and
labeling
and
sewing
them
.
From
the
doors
of
these
rooms
went
*NL*
men
with
loaded
trucks
,
to
the
platform
where
freight
cars
were
waiting
*NL*
to
be
filled
;
and
one
went
out
there
and
realized
with
a
start
that
he
*NL*
had
come
at
last
to
the
ground
floor
of
this
enormous
building
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
party
went
across
the
street
to
where
they
did
the
killing
*NL*
of
beef
--
where
every
hour
they
turned
four
or
five
hundred
cattle
into
*NL*
meat
.
Unlike
the
place
they
had
left
,
all
this
work
was
done
on
one
*NL*
floor
;
and
instead
of
there
being
one
line
of
carcasses
which
moved
to
*NL*
the
workmen
,
there
were
fifteen
or
twenty
lines
,
and
the
men
moved
*NL*
from
one
to
another
of
these
.
This
made
a
scene
of
intense
activity
,
a
*NL*
picture
of
human
power
wonderful
to
watch
.
It
was
all
in
one
great
room
,
*NL*
like
a
circus
amphitheater
,
with
a
gallery
for
visitors
running
over
the
*NL*
center
.
*NL*
*NL*
Along
one
side
of
the
room
ran
a
narrow
gallery
,
a
few
feet
from
the
*NL*
floor
;
into
which
gallery
the
cattle
were
driven
by
men
with
goads
which
*NL*
gave
them
electric
shocks
.
Once
crowded
in
here
,
the
creatures
were
*NL*
prisoned
,
each
in
a
separate
pen
,
by
gates
that
shut
,
leaving
them
no
*NL*
room
to
turn
around
;
and
while
they
stood
bellowing
and
plunging
,
over
*NL*
the
top
of
the
pen
there
leaned
one
of
the
``
knockers
,
''
armed
with
a
*NL*
sledge
hammer
,
and
watching
for
a
chance
to
deal
a
blow
.
The
room
echoed
*NL*
with
the
thuds
in
quick
succession
,
and
the
stamping
and
kicking
of
the
*NL*
steers
.
The
instant
the
animal
had
fallen
,
the
``
knocker
''
passed
on
to
*NL*
another
;
while
a
second
man
raised
a
lever
,
and
the
side
of
the
pen
was
*NL*
raised
,
and
the
animal
,
still
kicking
and
struggling
,
slid
out
to
*NL*
the
``
killing
bed
.
''
Here
a
man
put
shackles
about
one
leg
,
and
pressed
*NL*
another
lever
,
and
the
body
was
jerked
up
into
the
air
.
There
were
*NL*
fifteen
or
twenty
such
pens
,
and
it
was
a
matter
of
only
a
couple
of
*NL*
minutes
to
knock
fifteen
or
twenty
cattle
and
roll
them
out
.
Then
once
*NL*
more
the
gates
were
opened
,
and
another
lot
rushed
in
;
and
so
out
of
*NL*
each
pen
there
rolled
a
steady
stream
of
carcasses
,
which
the
men
upon
*NL*
the
killing
beds
had
to
get
out
of
the
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
manner
in
which
they
did
this
was
something
to
be
seen
and
never
*NL*
forgotten
.
They
worked
with
furious
intensity
,
literally
upon
the
*NL*
run
--
at
a
pace
with
which
there
is
nothing
to
be
compared
except
a
*NL*
football
game
.
It
was
all
highly
specialized
labor
,
each
man
having
his
*NL*
task
to
do
;
generally
this
would
consist
of
only
two
or
three
specific
*NL*
cuts
,
and
he
would
pass
down
the
line
of
fifteen
or
twenty
carcasses
,
*NL*
making
these
cuts
upon
each
.
First
there
came
the
``
butcher
,
''
to
bleed
*NL*
them
;
this
meant
one
swift
stroke
,
so
swift
that
you
could
not
see
*NL*
it
--
only
the
flash
of
the
knife
;
and
before
you
could
realize
it
,
the
*NL*
man
had
darted
on
to
the
next
line
,
and
a
stream
of
bright
red
was
*NL*
pouring
out
upon
the
floor
.
This
floor
was
half
an
inch
deep
with
blood
,
*NL*
in
spite
of
the
best
efforts
of
men
who
kept
shoveling
it
through
holes
;
*NL*
it
must
have
made
the
floor
slippery
,
but
no
one
could
have
guessed
this
*NL*
by
watching
the
men
at
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
carcass
hung
for
a
few
minutes
to
bleed
;
there
was
no
time
lost
,
*NL*
however
,
for
there
were
several
hanging
in
each
line
,
and
one
was
always
*NL*
ready
.
It
was
let
down
to
the
ground
,
and
there
came
the
``
headsman
,
''
*NL*
whose
task
it
was
to
sever
the
head
,
with
two
or
three
swift
strokes
.
*NL*
Then
came
the
``
floorsman
,
''
to
make
the
first
cut
in
the
skin
;
and
then
*NL*
another
to
finish
ripping
the
skin
down
the
center
;
and
then
half
a
*NL*
dozen
more
in
swift
succession
,
to
finish
the
skinning
.
After
they
were
*NL*
through
,
the
carcass
was
again
swung
up
;
and
while
a
man
with
a
stick
*NL*
examined
the
skin
,
to
make
sure
that
it
had
not
been
cut
,
and
another
*NL*
rolled
it
up
and
tumbled
it
through
one
of
the
inevitable
holes
in
the
*NL*
floor
,
the
beef
proceeded
on
its
journey
.
There
were
men
to
cut
it
,
and
*NL*
men
to
split
it
,
and
men
to
gut
it
and
scrape
it
clean
inside
.
There
*NL*
were
some
with
hose
which
threw
jets
of
boiling
water
upon
it
,
and
*NL*
others
who
removed
the
feet
and
added
the
final
touches
.
In
the
end
,
as
*NL*
with
the
hogs
,
the
finished
beef
was
run
into
the
chilling
room
,
to
hang
*NL*
its
appointed
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
visitors
were
taken
there
and
shown
them
,
all
neatly
hung
in
rows
,
*NL*
labeled
conspicuously
with
the
tags
of
the
government
inspectors
--
and
*NL*
some
,
which
had
been
killed
by
a
special
process
,
marked
with
the
*NL*
sign
of
the
kosher
rabbi
,
certifying
that
it
was
fit
for
sale
to
the
*NL*
orthodox
.
And
then
the
visitors
were
taken
to
the
other
parts
of
the
*NL*
building
,
to
see
what
became
of
each
particle
of
the
waste
material
*NL*
that
had
vanished
through
the
floor
;
and
to
the
pickling
rooms
,
and
the
*NL*
salting
rooms
,
the
canning
rooms
,
and
the
packing
rooms
,
where
choice
*NL*
meat
was
prepared
for
shipping
in
refrigerator
cars
,
destined
to
be
*NL*
eaten
in
all
the
four
corners
of
civilization
.
Afterward
they
went
*NL*
outside
,
wandering
about
among
the
mazes
of
buildings
in
which
was
done
*NL*
the
work
auxiliary
to
this
great
industry
.
There
was
scarcely
a
*NL*
thing
needed
in
the
business
that
Durham
and
Company
did
not
make
for
*NL*
themselves
.
There
was
a
great
steam
power
plant
and
an
electricity
*NL*
plant
.
There
was
a
barrel
factory
,
and
a
boiler-repair
shop
.
There
was
a
*NL*
building
to
which
the
grease
was
piped
,
and
made
into
soap
and
lard
;
and
*NL*
then
there
was
a
factory
for
making
lard
cans
,
and
another
for
making
*NL*
soap
boxes
.
There
was
a
building
in
which
the
bristles
were
cleaned
*NL*
and
dried
,
for
the
making
of
hair
cushions
and
such
things
;
there
was
a
*NL*
building
where
the
skins
were
dried
and
tanned
,
there
was
another
where
*NL*
heads
and
feet
were
made
into
glue
,
and
another
where
bones
were
made
*NL*
into
fertilizer
.
No
tiniest
particle
of
organic
matter
was
wasted
in
*NL*
Durham
's
.
Out
of
the
horns
of
the
cattle
they
made
combs
,
buttons
,
*NL*
hairpins
,
and
imitation
ivory
;
out
of
the
shinbones
and
other
big
bones
*NL*
they
cut
knife
and
toothbrush
handles
,
and
mouthpieces
for
pipes
;
out
of
*NL*
the
hoofs
they
cut
hairpins
and
buttons
,
before
they
made
the
rest
into
*NL*
glue
.
From
such
things
as
feet
,
knuckles
,
hide
clippings
,
and
sinews
*NL*
came
such
strange
and
unlikely
products
as
gelatin
,
isinglass
,
*NL*
and
phosphorus
,
bone
black
,
shoe
blacking
,
and
bone
oil
.
They
had
*NL*
curled-hair
works
for
the
cattle
tails
,
and
a
``
wool
pullery
''
for
the
*NL*
sheepskins
;
they
made
pepsin
from
the
stomachs
of
the
pigs
,
and
albumen
*NL*
from
the
blood
,
and
violin
strings
from
the
ill-smelling
entrails
.
When
*NL*
there
was
nothing
else
to
be
done
with
a
thing
,
they
first
put
it
into
a
*NL*
tank
and
got
out
of
it
all
the
tallow
and
grease
,
and
then
they
made
it
*NL*
into
fertilizer
.
All
these
industries
were
gathered
into
buildings
near
*NL*
by
,
connected
by
galleries
and
railroads
with
the
main
establishment
;
*NL*
and
it
was
estimated
that
they
had
handled
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
*NL*
billion
of
animals
since
the
founding
of
the
plant
by
the
elder
Durham
*NL*
a
generation
and
more
ago
.
If
you
counted
with
it
the
other
big
*NL*
plants
--
and
they
were
now
really
all
one
--
it
was
,
so
Jokubas
informed
*NL*
them
,
the
greatest
aggregation
of
labor
and
capital
ever
gathered
in
*NL*
one
place
.
It
employed
thirty
thousand
men
;
it
supported
directly
two
*NL*
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
people
in
its
neighborhood
,
and
indirectly
it
*NL*
supported
half
a
million
.
It
sent
its
products
to
every
country
in
*NL*
the
civilized
world
,
and
it
furnished
the
food
for
no
less
than
thirty
*NL*
million
people
!
*NL*
*NL*
To
all
of
these
things
our
friends
would
listen
open-mouthed
--
it
seemed
*NL*
to
them
impossible
of
belief
that
anything
so
stupendous
could
have
been
*NL*
devised
by
mortal
man
.
That
was
why
to
Jurgis
it
seemed
almost
profanity
*NL*
to
speak
about
the
place
as
did
Jokubas
,
skeptically
;
it
was
a
thing
*NL*
as
tremendous
as
the
universe
--
the
laws
and
ways
of
its
working
no
more
*NL*
than
the
universe
to
be
questioned
or
understood
.
All
that
a
mere
man
*NL*
could
do
,
it
seemed
to
Jurgis
,
was
to
take
a
thing
like
this
as
he
found
*NL*
it
,
and
do
as
he
was
told
;
to
be
given
a
place
in
it
and
a
share
in
*NL*
its
wonderful
activities
was
a
blessing
to
be
grateful
for
,
as
one
was
*NL*
grateful
for
the
sunshine
and
the
rain
.
Jurgis
was
even
glad
that
he
had
*NL*
not
seen
the
place
before
meeting
with
his
triumph
,
for
he
felt
that
the
*NL*
size
of
it
would
have
overwhelmed
him
.
But
now
he
had
been
admitted
--
he
*NL*
was
a
part
of
it
all
!
He
had
the
feeling
that
this
whole
huge
*NL*
establishment
had
taken
him
under
its
protection
,
and
had
become
*NL*
responsible
for
his
welfare
.
So
guileless
was
he
,
and
ignorant
of
the
*NL*
nature
of
business
,
that
he
did
not
even
realize
that
he
had
become
an
*NL*
employee
of
Brown
's
,
and
that
Brown
and
Durham
were
supposed
by
all
the
*NL*
world
to
be
deadly
rivals
--
were
even
required
to
be
deadly
rivals
by
the
*NL*
law
of
the
land
,
and
ordered
to
try
to
ruin
each
other
under
penalty
of
*NL*
fine
and
imprisonment
!

Promptly
at
seven
the
next
morning
Jurgis
reported
for
work
.
He
came
*NL*
to
the
door
that
had
been
pointed
out
to
him
,
and
there
he
waited
for
*NL*
nearly
two
hours
.
The
boss
had
meant
for
him
to
enter
,
but
had
not
said
*NL*
this
,
and
so
it
was
only
when
on
his
way
out
to
hire
another
man
that
*NL*
he
came
upon
Jurgis
.
He
gave
him
a
good
cursing
,
but
as
Jurgis
did
not
*NL*
understand
a
word
of
it
he
did
not
object
.
He
followed
the
boss
,
who
*NL*
showed
him
where
to
put
his
street
clothes
,
and
waited
while
he
donned
*NL*
the
working
clothes
he
had
bought
in
a
secondhand
shop
and
brought
with
*NL*
him
in
a
bundle
;
then
he
led
him
to
the
``
killing
beds
.
''
The
work
which
*NL*
Jurgis
was
to
do
here
was
very
simple
,
and
it
took
him
but
a
few
minutes
*NL*
to
learn
it
.
He
was
provided
with
a
stiff
besom
,
such
as
is
used
by
*NL*
street
sweepers
,
and
it
was
his
place
to
follow
down
the
line
the
man
*NL*
who
drew
out
the
smoking
entrails
from
the
carcass
of
the
steer
;
this
*NL*
mass
was
to
be
swept
into
a
trap
,
which
was
then
closed
,
so
that
no
one
*NL*
might
slip
into
it
.
As
Jurgis
came
in
,
the
first
cattle
of
the
morning
*NL*
were
just
making
their
appearance
;
and
so
,
with
scarcely
time
to
look
*NL*
about
him
,
and
none
to
speak
to
any
one
,
he
fell
to
work
.
It
was
a
*NL*
sweltering
day
in
July
,
and
the
place
ran
with
steaming
hot
blood
--
one
*NL*
waded
in
it
on
the
floor
.
The
stench
was
almost
overpowering
,
but
to
*NL*
Jurgis
it
was
nothing
.
His
whole
soul
was
dancing
with
joy
--
he
was
at
*NL*
work
at
last
!
He
was
at
work
and
earning
money
!
All
day
long
he
was
*NL*
figuring
to
himself
.
He
was
paid
the
fabulous
sum
of
seventeen
and
a
*NL*
half
cents
an
hour
;
and
as
it
proved
a
rush
day
and
he
worked
until
*NL*
nearly
seven
o'clock
in
the
evening
,
he
went
home
to
the
family
with
*NL*
the
tidings
that
he
had
earned
more
than
a
dollar
and
a
half
in
a
single
*NL*
day
!
*NL*
*NL*
At
home
,
also
,
there
was
more
good
news
;
so
much
of
it
at
once
that
*NL*
there
was
quite
a
celebration
in
Aniele
's
hall
bedroom
.
Jonas
had
been
*NL*
to
have
an
interview
with
the
special
policeman
to
whom
Szedvilas
had
*NL*
introduced
him
,
and
had
been
taken
to
see
several
of
the
bosses
,
with
*NL*
the
result
that
one
had
promised
him
a
job
the
beginning
of
the
next
*NL*
week
.
And
then
there
was
Marija
Berczynskas
,
who
,
fired
with
jealousy
by
*NL*
the
success
of
Jurgis
,
had
set
out
upon
her
own
responsibility
to
get
a
*NL*
place
.
Marija
had
nothing
to
take
with
her
save
her
two
brawny
arms
*NL*
and
the
word
``
job
,
''
laboriously
learned
;
but
with
these
she
had
marched
*NL*
about
Packingtown
all
day
,
entering
every
door
where
there
were
signs
of
*NL*
activity
.
Out
of
some
she
had
been
ordered
with
curses
;
but
Marija
was
*NL*
not
afraid
of
man
or
devil
,
and
asked
every
one
she
saw
--
visitors
and
*NL*
strangers
,
or
work-people
like
herself
,
and
once
or
twice
even
high
and
*NL*
lofty
office
personages
,
who
stared
at
her
as
if
they
thought
she
was
*NL*
crazy
.
In
the
end
,
however
,
she
had
reaped
her
reward
.
In
one
of
the
*NL*
smaller
plants
she
had
stumbled
upon
a
room
where
scores
of
women
and
*NL*
girls
were
sitting
at
long
tables
preparing
smoked
beef
in
cans
;
and
*NL*
wandering
through
room
after
room
,
Marija
came
at
last
to
the
place
*NL*
where
the
sealed
cans
were
being
painted
and
labeled
,
and
here
she
had
*NL*
the
good
fortune
to
encounter
the
``
forelady
.
''
Marija
did
not
understand
*NL*
then
,
as
she
was
destined
to
understand
later
,
what
there
was
attractive
*NL*
to
a
``
forelady
''
about
the
combination
of
a
face
full
of
boundless
good
*NL*
nature
and
the
muscles
of
a
dray
horse
;
but
the
woman
had
told
her
to
*NL*
come
the
next
day
and
she
would
perhaps
give
her
a
chance
to
learn
the
*NL*
trade
of
painting
cans
.
The
painting
of
cans
being
skilled
piecework
,
*NL*
and
paying
as
much
as
two
dollars
a
day
,
Marija
burst
in
upon
the
family
*NL*
with
the
yell
of
a
Comanche
Indian
,
and
fell
to
capering
about
the
room
*NL*
so
as
to
frighten
the
baby
almost
into
convulsions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Better
luck
than
all
this
could
hardly
have
been
hoped
for
;
there
was
*NL*
only
one
of
them
left
to
seek
a
place
.
Jurgis
was
determined
that
Teta
*NL*
Elzbieta
should
stay
at
home
to
keep
house
,
and
that
Ona
should
help
*NL*
her
.
He
would
not
have
Ona
working
--
he
was
not
that
sort
of
a
man
,
he
*NL*
said
,
and
she
was
not
that
sort
of
a
woman
.
It
would
be
a
strange
thing
*NL*
if
a
man
like
him
could
not
support
the
family
,
with
the
help
of
*NL*
the
board
of
Jonas
and
Marija
.
He
would
not
even
hear
of
letting
the
*NL*
children
go
to
work
--
there
were
schools
here
in
America
for
children
,
*NL*
Jurgis
had
heard
,
to
which
they
could
go
for
nothing
.
That
the
priest
*NL*
would
object
to
these
schools
was
something
of
which
he
had
as
yet
no
*NL*
idea
,
and
for
the
present
his
mind
was
made
up
that
the
children
of
Teta
*NL*
Elzbieta
should
have
as
fair
a
chance
as
any
other
children
.
The
oldest
*NL*
of
them
,
little
Stanislovas
,
was
but
thirteen
,
and
small
for
his
age
*NL*
at
that
;
and
while
the
oldest
son
of
Szedvilas
was
only
twelve
,
and
had
*NL*
worked
for
over
a
year
at
Jones
's
,
Jurgis
would
have
it
that
Stanislovas
*NL*
should
learn
to
speak
English
,
and
grow
up
to
be
a
skilled
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
there
was
only
old
Dede
Antanas
;
Jurgis
would
have
had
him
rest
*NL*
too
,
but
he
was
forced
to
acknowledge
that
this
was
not
possible
,
and
,
*NL*
besides
,
the
old
man
would
not
hear
it
spoken
of
--
it
was
his
whim
to
*NL*
insist
that
he
was
as
lively
as
any
boy
.
He
had
come
to
America
as
*NL*
full
of
hope
as
the
best
of
them
;
and
now
he
was
the
chief
problem
that
*NL*
worried
his
son
.
For
every
one
that
Jurgis
spoke
to
assured
him
that
it
*NL*
was
a
waste
of
time
to
seek
employment
for
the
old
man
in
Packingtown
.
*NL*
Szedvilas
told
him
that
the
packers
did
not
even
keep
the
men
who
had
*NL*
grown
old
in
their
own
service
--
to
say
nothing
of
taking
on
new
ones
.
*NL*
And
not
only
was
it
the
rule
here
,
it
was
the
rule
everywhere
in
*NL*
America
,
so
far
as
he
knew
.
To
satisfy
Jurgis
he
had
asked
the
*NL*
policeman
,
and
brought
back
the
message
that
the
thing
was
not
to
be
*NL*
thought
of
.
They
had
not
told
this
to
old
Anthony
,
who
had
consequently
*NL*
spent
the
two
days
wandering
about
from
one
part
of
the
yards
to
*NL*
another
,
and
had
now
come
home
to
hear
about
the
triumph
of
the
others
,
*NL*
smiling
bravely
and
saying
that
it
would
be
his
turn
another
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
good
luck
,
they
felt
,
had
given
them
the
right
to
think
about
a
*NL*
home
;
and
sitting
out
on
the
doorstep
that
summer
evening
,
they
held
*NL*
consultation
about
it
,
and
Jurgis
took
occasion
to
broach
a
weighty
*NL*
subject
.
Passing
down
the
avenue
to
work
that
morning
he
had
seen
two
*NL*
boys
leaving
an
advertisement
from
house
to
house
;
and
seeing
that
there
*NL*
were
pictures
upon
it
,
Jurgis
had
asked
for
one
,
and
had
rolled
it
up
*NL*
and
tucked
it
into
his
shirt
.
At
noontime
a
man
with
whom
he
had
been
*NL*
talking
had
read
it
to
him
and
told
him
a
little
about
it
,
with
the
*NL*
result
that
Jurgis
had
conceived
a
wild
idea
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
brought
out
the
placard
,
which
was
quite
a
work
of
art
.
It
was
nearly
*NL*
two
feet
long
,
printed
on
calendered
paper
,
with
a
selection
of
colors
*NL*
so
bright
that
they
shone
even
in
the
moonlight
.
The
center
of
the
*NL*
placard
was
occupied
by
a
house
,
brilliantly
painted
,
new
,
and
dazzling
.
*NL*
The
roof
of
it
was
of
a
purple
hue
,
and
trimmed
with
gold
;
the
house
*NL*
itself
was
silvery
,
and
the
doors
and
windows
red
.
It
was
a
two-story
*NL*
building
,
with
a
porch
in
front
,
and
a
very
fancy
scrollwork
around
the
*NL*
edges
;
it
was
complete
in
every
tiniest
detail
,
even
the
doorknob
,
and
*NL*
there
was
a
hammock
on
the
porch
and
white
lace
curtains
in
the
windows
.
*NL*
Underneath
this
,
in
one
corner
,
was
a
picture
of
a
husband
and
wife
*NL*
in
loving
embrace
;
in
the
opposite
corner
was
a
cradle
,
with
*NL*
fluffy
curtains
drawn
over
it
,
and
a
smiling
cherub
hovering
upon
*NL*
silver-colored
wings
.
For
fear
that
the
significance
of
all
this
should
*NL*
be
lost
,
there
was
a
label
,
in
Polish
,
Lithuanian
,
and
German
--
``
Dom
.
*NL*
Namai
.
Heim
.
''
``
Why
pay
rent
?
''
the
linguistic
circular
went
on
to
demand
.
*NL*
``
Why
not
own
your
own
home
?
Do
you
know
that
you
can
buy
one
for
less
*NL*
than
your
rent
?
We
have
built
thousands
of
homes
which
are
now
occupied
*NL*
by
happy
families
.
''
--
So
it
became
eloquent
,
picturing
the
blissfulness
*NL*
of
married
life
in
a
house
with
nothing
to
pay
.
It
even
quoted
``
Home
,
*NL*
Sweet
Home
,
''
and
made
bold
to
translate
it
into
Polish
--
though
for
some
*NL*
reason
it
omitted
the
Lithuanian
of
this
.
Perhaps
the
translator
found
*NL*
it
a
difficult
matter
to
be
sentimental
in
a
language
in
which
a
sob
is
*NL*
known
as
a
gukcziojimas
and
a
smile
as
a
nusiszypsojimas
.
*NL*
*NL*
Over
this
document
the
family
pored
long
,
while
Ona
spelled
out
its
*NL*
contents
.
It
appeared
that
this
house
contained
four
rooms
,
besides
a
*NL*
basement
,
and
that
it
might
be
bought
for
fifteen
hundred
dollars
,
the
*NL*
lot
and
all
.
Of
this
,
only
three
hundred
dollars
had
to
be
paid
down
,
*NL*
the
balance
being
paid
at
the
rate
of
twelve
dollars
a
month
.
These
were
*NL*
frightful
sums
,
but
then
they
were
in
America
,
where
people
talked
about
*NL*
such
without
fear
.
They
had
learned
that
they
would
have
to
pay
a
*NL*
rent
of
nine
dollars
a
month
for
a
flat
,
and
there
was
no
way
of
doing
*NL*
better
,
unless
the
family
of
twelve
was
to
exist
in
one
or
two
rooms
,
as
*NL*
at
present
.
If
they
paid
rent
,
of
course
,
they
might
pay
forever
,
and
be
*NL*
no
better
off
;
whereas
,
if
they
could
only
meet
the
extra
expense
in
the
*NL*
beginning
,
there
would
at
last
come
a
time
when
they
would
not
have
any
*NL*
rent
to
pay
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
figured
it
up
.
There
was
a
little
left
of
the
money
belonging
to
*NL*
Teta
Elzbieta
,
and
there
was
a
little
left
to
Jurgis
.
Marija
had
about
*NL*
fifty
dollars
pinned
up
somewhere
in
her
stockings
,
and
Grandfather
*NL*
Anthony
had
part
of
the
money
he
had
gotten
for
his
farm
.
If
they
all
*NL*
combined
,
they
would
have
enough
to
make
the
first
payment
;
and
if
*NL*
they
had
employment
,
so
that
they
could
be
sure
of
the
future
,
it
might
*NL*
really
prove
the
best
plan
.
It
was
,
of
course
,
not
a
thing
even
to
be
*NL*
talked
of
lightly
;
it
was
a
thing
they
would
have
to
sift
to
the
bottom
.
*NL*
And
yet
,
on
the
other
hand
,
if
they
were
going
to
make
the
venture
,
the
*NL*
sooner
they
did
it
the
better
,
for
were
they
not
paying
rent
all
the
*NL*
time
,
and
living
in
a
most
horrible
way
besides
?
Jurgis
was
used
to
*NL*
dirt
--
there
was
nothing
could
scare
a
man
who
had
been
with
a
railroad
*NL*
gang
,
where
one
could
gather
up
the
fleas
off
the
floor
of
the
sleeping
*NL*
room
by
the
handful
.
But
that
sort
of
thing
would
not
do
for
Ona
.
They
*NL*
must
have
a
better
place
of
some
sort
soon
--
Jurgis
said
it
with
all
the
*NL*
assurance
of
a
man
who
had
just
made
a
dollar
and
fifty-seven
cents
in
*NL*
a
single
day
.
Jurgis
was
at
a
loss
to
understand
why
,
with
wages
as
they
*NL*
were
,
so
many
of
the
people
of
this
district
should
live
the
way
they
*NL*
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
Marija
went
to
see
her
``
forelady
,
''
and
was
told
to
report
*NL*
the
first
of
the
week
,
and
learn
the
business
of
can-painter
.
Marija
*NL*
went
home
,
singing
out
loud
all
the
way
,
and
was
just
in
time
to
join
*NL*
Ona
and
her
stepmother
as
they
were
setting
out
to
go
and
make
inquiry
*NL*
concerning
the
house
.
That
evening
the
three
made
their
report
to
the
*NL*
men
--
the
thing
was
altogether
as
represented
in
the
circular
,
or
at
any
*NL*
rate
so
the
agent
had
said
.
The
houses
lay
to
the
south
,
about
a
mile
*NL*
and
a
half
from
the
yards
;
they
were
wonderful
bargains
,
the
gentleman
*NL*
had
assured
them
--
personally
,
and
for
their
own
good
.
He
could
do
this
,
*NL*
so
he
explained
to
them
,
for
the
reason
that
he
had
himself
no
interest
*NL*
in
their
sale
--
he
was
merely
the
agent
for
a
company
that
had
built
*NL*
them
.
These
were
the
last
,
and
the
company
was
going
out
of
business
,
so
*NL*
if
any
one
wished
to
take
advantage
of
this
wonderful
no-rent
plan
,
he
*NL*
would
have
to
be
very
quick
.
As
a
matter
of
fact
there
was
just
a
little
*NL*
uncertainty
as
to
whether
there
was
a
single
house
left
;
for
the
agent
*NL*
had
taken
so
many
people
to
see
them
,
and
for
all
he
knew
the
company
*NL*
might
have
parted
with
the
last
.
Seeing
Teta
Elzbieta
's
evident
grief
at
*NL*
this
news
,
he
added
,
after
some
hesitation
,
that
if
they
really
intended
*NL*
to
make
a
purchase
,
he
would
send
a
telephone
message
at
his
own
*NL*
expense
,
and
have
one
of
the
houses
kept
.
So
it
had
finally
been
*NL*
arranged
--
and
they
were
to
go
and
make
an
inspection
the
following
*NL*
Sunday
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
Thursday
;
and
all
the
rest
of
the
week
the
killing
gang
*NL*
at
Brown
's
worked
at
full
pressure
,
and
Jurgis
cleared
a
dollar
*NL*
seventy-five
every
day
.
That
was
at
the
rate
of
ten
and
one-half
dollars
*NL*
a
week
,
or
forty-five
a
month
.
Jurgis
was
not
able
to
figure
,
except
it
*NL*
was
a
very
simple
sum
,
but
Ona
was
like
lightning
at
such
things
,
and
*NL*
she
worked
out
the
problem
for
the
family
.
Marija
and
Jonas
were
each
*NL*
to
pay
sixteen
dollars
a
month
board
,
and
the
old
man
insisted
that
he
*NL*
could
do
the
same
as
soon
as
he
got
a
place
--
which
might
be
any
day
now
.
*NL*
That
would
make
ninety-three
dollars
.
Then
Marija
and
Jonas
were
between
*NL*
them
to
take
a
third
share
in
the
house
,
which
would
leave
only
eight
*NL*
dollars
a
month
for
Jurgis
to
contribute
to
the
payment
.
So
they
would
*NL*
have
eighty-five
dollars
a
month
--
or
,
supposing
that
Dede
Antanas
did
*NL*
not
get
work
at
once
,
seventy
dollars
a
month
--
which
ought
surely
to
be
*NL*
sufficient
for
the
support
of
a
family
of
twelve
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
hour
before
the
time
on
Sunday
morning
the
entire
party
set
out
.
They
*NL*
had
the
address
written
on
a
piece
of
paper
,
which
they
showed
to
some
*NL*
one
now
and
then
.
It
proved
to
be
a
long
mile
and
a
half
,
but
they
*NL*
walked
it
,
and
half
an
hour
or
so
later
the
agent
put
in
an
appearance
.
*NL*
He
was
a
smooth
and
florid
personage
,
elegantly
dressed
,
and
he
spoke
*NL*
their
language
freely
,
which
gave
him
a
great
advantage
in
dealing
with
*NL*
them
.
He
escorted
them
to
the
house
,
which
was
one
of
a
long
row
of
the
*NL*
typical
frame
dwellings
of
the
neighborhood
,
where
architecture
is
a
*NL*
luxury
that
is
dispensed
with
.
Ona
's
heart
sank
,
for
the
house
was
not
*NL*
as
it
was
shown
in
the
picture
;
the
color
scheme
was
different
,
for
*NL*
one
thing
,
and
then
it
did
not
seem
quite
so
big
.
Still
,
it
was
freshly
*NL*
painted
,
and
made
a
considerable
show
.
It
was
all
brand-new
,
so
the
*NL*
agent
told
them
,
but
he
talked
so
incessantly
that
they
were
quite
*NL*
confused
,
and
did
not
have
time
to
ask
many
questions
.
There
were
all
*NL*
sorts
of
things
they
had
made
up
their
minds
to
inquire
about
,
but
when
*NL*
the
time
came
,
they
either
forgot
them
or
lacked
the
courage
.
The
other
*NL*
houses
in
the
row
did
not
seem
to
be
new
,
and
few
of
them
seemed
to
be
*NL*
occupied
.
When
they
ventured
to
hint
at
this
,
the
agent
's
reply
was
that
*NL*
the
purchasers
would
be
moving
in
shortly
.
To
press
the
matter
would
*NL*
have
seemed
to
be
doubting
his
word
,
and
never
in
their
lives
had
any
*NL*
one
of
them
ever
spoken
to
a
person
of
the
class
called
``
gentleman
''
*NL*
except
with
deference
and
humility
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
house
had
a
basement
,
about
two
feet
below
the
street
line
,
and
a
*NL*
single
story
,
about
six
feet
above
it
,
reached
by
a
flight
of
steps
.
In
*NL*
addition
there
was
an
attic
,
made
by
the
peak
of
the
roof
,
and
having
*NL*
one
small
window
in
each
end
.
The
street
in
front
of
the
house
was
*NL*
unpaved
and
unlighted
,
and
the
view
from
it
consisted
of
a
few
exactly
*NL*
similar
houses
,
scattered
here
and
there
upon
lots
grown
up
with
dingy
*NL*
brown
weeds
.
The
house
inside
contained
four
rooms
,
plastered
white
;
the
*NL*
basement
was
but
a
frame
,
the
walls
being
unplastered
and
the
floor
not
*NL*
laid
.
The
agent
explained
that
the
houses
were
built
that
way
,
as
the
*NL*
purchasers
generally
preferred
to
finish
the
basements
to
suit
their
own
*NL*
taste
.
The
attic
was
also
unfinished
--
the
family
had
been
figuring
that
*NL*
in
case
of
an
emergency
they
could
rent
this
attic
,
but
they
found
that
*NL*
there
was
not
even
a
floor
,
nothing
but
joists
,
and
beneath
them
the
*NL*
lath
and
plaster
of
the
ceiling
below
.
All
of
this
,
however
,
did
not
*NL*
chill
their
ardor
as
much
as
might
have
been
expected
,
because
of
the
*NL*
volubility
of
the
agent
.
There
was
no
end
to
the
advantages
of
the
*NL*
house
,
as
he
set
them
forth
,
and
he
was
not
silent
for
an
instant
;
he
*NL*
showed
them
everything
,
down
to
the
locks
on
the
doors
and
the
catches
*NL*
on
the
windows
,
and
how
to
work
them
.
He
showed
them
the
sink
in
the
*NL*
kitchen
,
with
running
water
and
a
faucet
,
something
which
Teta
Elzbieta
*NL*
had
never
in
her
wildest
dreams
hoped
to
possess
.
After
a
discovery
such
*NL*
as
that
it
would
have
seemed
ungrateful
to
find
any
fault
,
and
so
they
*NL*
tried
to
shut
their
eyes
to
other
defects
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
,
they
were
peasant
people
,
and
they
hung
on
to
their
money
by
*NL*
instinct
;
it
was
quite
in
vain
that
the
agent
hinted
at
promptness
--
they
*NL*
would
see
,
they
would
see
,
they
told
him
,
they
could
not
decide
until
*NL*
they
had
had
more
time
.
And
so
they
went
home
again
,
and
all
day
and
*NL*
evening
there
was
figuring
and
debating
.
It
was
an
agony
to
them
to
have
*NL*
to
make
up
their
minds
in
a
matter
such
as
this
.
They
never
could
agree
*NL*
all
together
;
there
were
so
many
arguments
upon
each
side
,
and
one
would
*NL*
be
obstinate
,
and
no
sooner
would
the
rest
have
convinced
him
than
it
*NL*
would
transpire
that
his
arguments
had
caused
another
to
waver
.
Once
,
in
*NL*
the
evening
,
when
they
were
all
in
harmony
,
and
the
house
was
as
good
as
*NL*
bought
,
Szedvilas
came
in
and
upset
them
again
.
Szedvilas
had
no
use
for
*NL*
property
owning
.
He
told
them
cruel
stories
of
people
who
had
been
done
*NL*
to
death
in
this
``
buying
a
home
''
swindle
.
They
would
be
almost
sure
to
*NL*
get
into
a
tight
place
and
lose
all
their
money
;
and
there
was
no
end
*NL*
of
expense
that
one
could
never
foresee
;
and
the
house
might
be
*NL*
good-for-nothing
from
top
to
bottom
--
how
was
a
poor
man
to
know
?
Then
,
*NL*
too
,
they
would
swindle
you
with
the
contract
--
and
how
was
a
poor
man
*NL*
to
understand
anything
about
a
contract
?
It
was
all
nothing
but
robbery
,
*NL*
and
there
was
no
safety
but
in
keeping
out
of
it
.
And
pay
rent
?
asked
*NL*
Jurgis
.
Ah
,
yes
,
to
be
sure
,
the
other
answered
,
that
too
was
robbery
.
*NL*
It
was
all
robbery
,
for
a
poor
man
.
After
half
an
hour
of
such
*NL*
depressing
conversation
,
they
had
their
minds
quite
made
up
that
they
*NL*
had
been
saved
at
the
brink
of
a
precipice
;
but
then
Szedvilas
went
*NL*
away
,
and
Jonas
,
who
was
a
sharp
little
man
,
reminded
them
that
the
*NL*
delicatessen
business
was
a
failure
,
according
to
its
proprietor
,
and
*NL*
that
this
might
account
for
his
pessimistic
views
.
Which
,
of
course
,
*NL*
reopened
the
subject
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
controlling
factor
was
that
they
could
not
stay
where
they
*NL*
were
--
they
had
to
go
somewhere
.
And
when
they
gave
up
the
house
plan
and
*NL*
decided
to
rent
,
the
prospect
of
paying
out
nine
dollars
a
month
forever
*NL*
they
found
just
as
hard
to
face
.
All
day
and
all
night
for
nearly
a
*NL*
whole
week
they
wrestled
with
the
problem
,
and
then
in
the
end
Jurgis
*NL*
took
the
responsibility
.
Brother
Jonas
had
gotten
his
job
,
and
was
*NL*
pushing
a
truck
in
Durham
's
;
and
the
killing
gang
at
Brown
's
continued
*NL*
to
work
early
and
late
,
so
that
Jurgis
grew
more
confident
every
hour
,
*NL*
more
certain
of
his
mastership
.
It
was
the
kind
of
thing
the
man
of
the
*NL*
family
had
to
decide
and
carry
through
,
he
told
himself
.
Others
might
*NL*
have
failed
at
it
,
but
he
was
not
the
failing
kind
--
he
would
show
them
*NL*
how
to
do
it
.
He
would
work
all
day
,
and
all
night
,
too
,
if
need
be
;
he
*NL*
would
never
rest
until
the
house
was
paid
for
and
his
people
had
a
home
.
*NL*
So
he
told
them
,
and
so
in
the
end
the
decision
was
made
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
talked
about
looking
at
more
houses
before
they
made
the
*NL*
purchase
;
but
then
they
did
not
know
where
any
more
were
,
and
they
did
*NL*
not
know
any
way
of
finding
out
.
The
one
they
had
seen
held
the
sway
in
*NL*
their
thoughts
;
whenever
they
thought
of
themselves
in
a
house
,
it
was
*NL*
this
house
that
they
thought
of
.
And
so
they
went
and
told
the
agent
*NL*
that
they
were
ready
to
make
the
agreement
.
They
knew
,
as
an
abstract
*NL*
proposition
,
that
in
matters
of
business
all
men
are
to
be
accounted
*NL*
liars
;
but
they
could
not
but
have
been
influenced
by
all
they
had
heard
*NL*
from
the
eloquent
agent
,
and
were
quite
persuaded
that
the
house
was
*NL*
something
they
had
run
a
risk
of
losing
by
their
delay
.
They
drew
a
deep
*NL*
breath
when
he
told
them
that
they
were
still
in
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
to
come
on
the
morrow
,
and
he
would
have
the
papers
all
drawn
*NL*
up
.
This
matter
of
papers
was
one
in
which
Jurgis
understood
to
the
full
*NL*
the
need
of
caution
;
yet
he
could
not
go
himself
--
every
one
told
him
*NL*
that
he
could
not
get
a
holiday
,
and
that
he
might
lose
his
job
by
*NL*
asking
.
So
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
trust
it
to
the
women
,
*NL*
with
Szedvilas
,
who
promised
to
go
with
them
.
Jurgis
spent
a
whole
*NL*
evening
impressing
upon
them
the
seriousness
of
the
occasion
--
and
then
*NL*
finally
,
out
of
innumerable
hiding
places
about
their
persons
and
in
*NL*
their
baggage
,
came
forth
the
precious
wads
of
money
,
to
be
done
up
*NL*
tightly
in
a
little
bag
and
sewed
fast
in
the
lining
of
Teta
Elzbieta
's
*NL*
dress
.
*NL*
*NL*
Early
in
the
morning
they
sallied
forth
.
Jurgis
had
given
them
so
many
*NL*
instructions
and
warned
them
against
so
many
perils
,
that
the
women
were
*NL*
quite
pale
with
fright
,
and
even
the
imperturbable
delicatessen
vender
,
*NL*
who
prided
himself
upon
being
a
businessman
,
was
ill
at
ease
.
The
agent
*NL*
had
the
deed
all
ready
,
and
invited
them
to
sit
down
and
read
it
;
this
*NL*
Szedvilas
proceeded
to
do
--
a
painful
and
laborious
process
,
during
which
*NL*
the
agent
drummed
upon
the
desk
.
Teta
Elzbieta
was
so
embarrassed
that
*NL*
the
perspiration
came
out
upon
her
forehead
in
beads
;
for
was
not
this
*NL*
reading
as
much
as
to
say
plainly
to
the
gentleman
's
face
that
they
*NL*
doubted
his
honesty
?
Yet
Jokubas
Szedvilas
read
on
and
on
;
and
presently
*NL*
there
developed
that
he
had
good
reason
for
doing
so
.
For
a
horrible
*NL*
suspicion
had
begun
dawning
in
his
mind
;
he
knitted
his
brows
more
and
*NL*
more
as
he
read
.
This
was
not
a
deed
of
sale
at
all
,
so
far
as
he
could
*NL*
see
--
it
provided
only
for
the
renting
of
the
property
!
It
was
hard
*NL*
to
tell
,
with
all
this
strange
legal
jargon
,
words
he
had
never
heard
*NL*
before
;
but
was
not
this
plain
--
``
the
party
of
the
first
part
hereby
*NL*
covenants
and
agrees
to
rent
to
the
said
party
of
the
second
part
!
''
And
*NL*
then
again
--
``
a
monthly
rental
of
twelve
dollars
,
for
a
period
of
eight
*NL*
years
and
four
months
!
''
Then
Szedvilas
took
off
his
spectacles
,
and
*NL*
looked
at
the
agent
,
and
stammered
a
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
agent
was
most
polite
,
and
explained
that
that
was
the
usual
*NL*
formula
;
that
it
was
always
arranged
that
the
property
should
be
merely
*NL*
rented
.
He
kept
trying
to
show
them
something
in
the
next
paragraph
;
but
*NL*
Szedvilas
could
not
get
by
the
word
``
rental
''
--
and
when
he
translated
it
*NL*
to
Teta
Elzbieta
,
she
too
was
thrown
into
a
fright
.
They
would
not
own
*NL*
the
home
at
all
,
then
,
for
nearly
nine
years
!
The
agent
,
with
infinite
*NL*
patience
,
began
to
explain
again
;
but
no
explanation
would
do
now
.
*NL*
Elzbieta
had
firmly
fixed
in
her
mind
the
last
solemn
warning
of
Jurgis
:
*NL*
``
If
there
is
anything
wrong
,
do
not
give
him
the
money
,
but
go
out
and
*NL*
get
a
lawyer
.
''
It
was
an
agonizing
moment
,
but
she
sat
in
the
chair
,
her
*NL*
hands
clenched
like
death
,
and
made
a
fearful
effort
,
summoning
all
her
*NL*
powers
,
and
gasped
out
her
purpose
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jokubas
translated
her
words
.
She
expected
the
agent
to
fly
into
a
*NL*
passion
,
but
he
was
,
to
her
bewilderment
,
as
ever
imperturbable
;
he
even
*NL*
offered
to
go
and
get
a
lawyer
for
her
,
but
she
declined
this
.
They
went
*NL*
a
long
way
,
on
purpose
to
find
a
man
who
would
not
be
a
confederate
.
*NL*
Then
let
any
one
imagine
their
dismay
,
when
,
after
half
an
hour
,
they
*NL*
came
in
with
a
lawyer
,
and
heard
him
greet
the
agent
by
his
first
name
!
*NL*
They
felt
that
all
was
lost
;
they
sat
like
prisoners
summoned
to
hear
*NL*
the
reading
of
their
death
warrant
.
There
was
nothing
more
that
they
*NL*
could
do
--
they
were
trapped
!
The
lawyer
read
over
the
deed
,
and
when
*NL*
he
had
read
it
he
informed
Szedvilas
that
it
was
all
perfectly
regular
,
*NL*
that
the
deed
was
a
blank
deed
such
as
was
often
used
in
these
sales
.
*NL*
And
was
the
price
as
agreed
?
the
old
man
asked
--
three
hundred
dollars
*NL*
down
,
and
the
balance
at
twelve
dollars
a
month
,
till
the
total
of
*NL*
fifteen
hundred
dollars
had
been
paid
?
Yes
,
that
was
correct
.
And
it
was
*NL*
for
the
sale
of
such
and
such
a
house
--
the
house
and
lot
and
everything
?
*NL*
Yes
,
--
and
the
lawyer
showed
him
where
that
was
all
written
.
And
it
was
*NL*
all
perfectly
regular
--
there
were
no
tricks
about
it
of
any
sort
?
They
*NL*
were
poor
people
,
and
this
was
all
they
had
in
the
world
,
and
if
there
*NL*
was
anything
wrong
they
would
be
ruined
.
And
so
Szedvilas
went
on
,
*NL*
asking
one
trembling
question
after
another
,
while
the
eyes
of
the
women
*NL*
folks
were
fixed
upon
him
in
mute
agony
.
They
could
not
understand
what
*NL*
he
was
saying
,
but
they
knew
that
upon
it
their
fate
depended
.
And
when
*NL*
at
last
he
had
questioned
until
there
was
no
more
questioning
to
be
*NL*
done
,
and
the
time
came
for
them
to
make
up
their
minds
,
and
either
*NL*
close
the
bargain
or
reject
it
,
it
was
all
that
poor
Teta
Elzbieta
could
*NL*
do
to
keep
from
bursting
into
tears
.
Jokubas
had
asked
her
if
she
wished
*NL*
to
sign
;
he
had
asked
her
twice
--
and
what
could
she
say
?
How
did
she
*NL*
know
if
this
lawyer
were
telling
the
truth
--
that
he
was
not
in
the
*NL*
conspiracy
?
And
yet
,
how
could
she
say
so
--
what
excuse
could
she
give
?
*NL*
The
eyes
of
every
one
in
the
room
were
upon
her
,
awaiting
her
decision
;
*NL*
and
at
last
,
half
blind
with
her
tears
,
she
began
fumbling
in
her
*NL*
jacket
,
where
she
had
pinned
the
precious
money
.
And
she
brought
it
out
*NL*
and
unwrapped
it
before
the
men
.
All
of
this
Ona
sat
watching
,
from
a
*NL*
corner
of
the
room
,
twisting
her
hands
together
,
meantime
,
in
a
fever
of
*NL*
fright
.
Ona
longed
to
cry
out
and
tell
her
stepmother
to
stop
,
that
it
*NL*
was
all
a
trap
;
but
there
seemed
to
be
something
clutching
her
by
the
*NL*
throat
,
and
she
could
not
make
a
sound
.
And
so
Teta
Elzbieta
laid
the
*NL*
money
on
the
table
,
and
the
agent
picked
it
up
and
counted
it
,
and
then
*NL*
wrote
them
a
receipt
for
it
and
passed
them
the
deed
.
Then
he
gave
a
*NL*
sigh
of
satisfaction
,
and
rose
and
shook
hands
with
them
all
,
still
as
*NL*
smooth
and
polite
as
at
the
beginning
.
Ona
had
a
dim
recollection
of
the
*NL*
lawyer
telling
Szedvilas
that
his
charge
was
a
dollar
,
which
occasioned
*NL*
some
debate
,
and
more
agony
;
and
then
,
after
they
had
paid
that
,
too
,
*NL*
they
went
out
into
the
street
,
her
stepmother
clutching
the
deed
in
her
*NL*
hand
.
They
were
so
weak
from
fright
that
they
could
not
walk
,
but
had
to
*NL*
sit
down
on
the
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
they
went
home
,
with
a
deadly
terror
gnawing
at
their
souls
;
and
that
*NL*
evening
Jurgis
came
home
and
heard
their
story
,
and
that
was
the
end
.
*NL*
Jurgis
was
sure
that
they
had
been
swindled
,
and
were
ruined
;
and
he
*NL*
tore
his
hair
and
cursed
like
a
madman
,
swearing
that
he
would
kill
the
*NL*
agent
that
very
night
.
In
the
end
he
seized
the
paper
and
rushed
out
*NL*
of
the
house
,
and
all
the
way
across
the
yards
to
Halsted
Street
.
He
*NL*
dragged
Szedvilas
out
from
his
supper
,
and
together
they
rushed
to
*NL*
consult
another
lawyer
.
When
they
entered
his
office
the
lawyer
*NL*
sprang
up
,
for
Jurgis
looked
like
a
crazy
person
,
with
flying
hair
and
*NL*
bloodshot
eyes
.
His
companion
explained
the
situation
,
and
the
lawyer
*NL*
took
the
paper
and
began
to
read
it
,
while
Jurgis
stood
clutching
the
*NL*
desk
with
knotted
hands
,
trembling
in
every
nerve
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
or
twice
the
lawyer
looked
up
and
asked
a
question
of
Szedvilas
;
*NL*
the
other
did
not
know
a
word
that
he
was
saying
,
but
his
eyes
were
*NL*
fixed
upon
the
lawyer
's
face
,
striving
in
an
agony
of
dread
to
read
his
*NL*
mind
.
He
saw
the
lawyer
look
up
and
laugh
,
and
he
gave
a
gasp
;
the
man
*NL*
said
something
to
Szedvilas
,
and
Jurgis
turned
upon
his
friend
,
his
*NL*
heart
almost
stopping
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
he
panted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
says
it
is
all
right
,
''
said
Szedvilas
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
he
says
it
is
just
as
it
should
be
.
''
And
Jurgis
,
in
his
relief
,
*NL*
sank
down
into
a
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
sure
of
it
?
''
he
gasped
,
and
made
Szedvilas
translate
question
*NL*
after
question
.
He
could
not
hear
it
often
enough
;
he
could
not
ask
*NL*
with
enough
variations
.
Yes
,
they
had
bought
the
house
,
they
had
really
*NL*
bought
it
.
It
belonged
to
them
,
they
had
only
to
pay
the
money
and
it
*NL*
would
be
all
right
.
Then
Jurgis
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
,
for
*NL*
there
were
tears
in
his
eyes
,
and
he
felt
like
a
fool
.
But
he
had
had
*NL*
such
a
horrible
fright
;
strong
man
as
he
was
,
it
left
him
almost
too
*NL*
weak
to
stand
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lawyer
explained
that
the
rental
was
a
form
--
the
property
was
said
*NL*
to
be
merely
rented
until
the
last
payment
had
been
made
,
the
purpose
*NL*
being
to
make
it
easier
to
turn
the
party
out
if
he
did
not
make
the
*NL*
payments
.
So
long
as
they
paid
,
however
,
they
had
nothing
to
fear
,
the
*NL*
house
was
all
theirs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
was
so
grateful
that
he
paid
the
half
dollar
the
lawyer
asked
*NL*
without
winking
an
eyelash
,
and
then
rushed
home
to
tell
the
news
to
the
*NL*
family
.
He
found
Ona
in
a
faint
and
the
babies
screaming
,
and
the
whole
*NL*
house
in
an
uproar
--
for
it
had
been
believed
by
all
that
he
had
gone
to
*NL*
murder
the
agent
.
It
was
hours
before
the
excitement
could
be
calmed
;
*NL*
and
all
through
that
cruel
night
Jurgis
would
wake
up
now
and
then
*NL*
and
hear
Ona
and
her
stepmother
in
the
next
room
,
sobbing
softly
to
*NL*
themselves
.

They
had
bought
their
home
.
It
was
hard
for
them
to
realize
that
the
*NL*
wonderful
house
was
theirs
to
move
into
whenever
they
chose
.
They
spent
*NL*
all
their
time
thinking
about
it
,
and
what
they
were
going
to
put
into
*NL*
it
.
As
their
week
with
Aniele
was
up
in
three
days
,
they
lost
no
time
*NL*
in
getting
ready
.
They
had
to
make
some
shift
to
furnish
it
,
and
every
*NL*
instant
of
their
leisure
was
given
to
discussing
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
person
who
had
such
a
task
before
him
would
not
need
to
look
very
far
*NL*
in
Packingtown
--
he
had
only
to
walk
up
the
avenue
and
read
the
signs
,
*NL*
or
get
into
a
streetcar
,
to
obtain
full
information
as
to
pretty
much
*NL*
everything
a
human
creature
could
need
.
It
was
quite
touching
,
the
zeal
*NL*
of
people
to
see
that
his
health
and
happiness
were
provided
for
.
Did
*NL*
the
person
wish
to
smoke
?
There
was
a
little
discourse
about
cigars
,
*NL*
showing
him
exactly
why
the
Thomas
Jefferson
Five-cent
Perfecto
was
the
*NL*
only
cigar
worthy
of
the
name
.
Had
he
,
on
the
other
hand
,
smoked
too
*NL*
much
?
Here
was
a
remedy
for
the
smoking
habit
,
twenty-five
doses
for
a
*NL*
quarter
,
and
a
cure
absolutely
guaranteed
in
ten
doses
.
In
innumerable
*NL*
ways
such
as
this
,
the
traveler
found
that
somebody
had
been
busied
to
*NL*
make
smooth
his
paths
through
the
world
,
and
to
let
him
know
what
had
*NL*
been
done
for
him
.
In
Packingtown
the
advertisements
had
a
style
all
*NL*
of
their
own
,
adapted
to
the
peculiar
population
.
One
would
be
tenderly
*NL*
solicitous
.
``
Is
your
wife
pale
?
''
it
would
inquire
.
``
Is
she
discouraged
,
*NL*
does
she
drag
herself
about
the
house
and
find
fault
with
everything
?
*NL*
Why
do
you
not
tell
her
to
try
Dr.
Lanahan
's
Life
Preservers
?
''
Another
*NL*
would
be
jocular
in
tone
,
slapping
you
on
the
back
,
so
to
speak
.
``
Do
n't
*NL*
be
a
chump
!
''
it
would
exclaim
.
``
Go
and
get
the
Goliath
Bunion
Cure
.
''
*NL*
``
Get
a
move
on
you
!
''
would
chime
in
another
.
``
It
's
easy
,
if
you
wear
the
*NL*
Eureka
Two-fifty
Shoe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Among
these
importunate
signs
was
one
that
had
caught
the
attention
*NL*
of
the
family
by
its
pictures
.
It
showed
two
very
pretty
little
birds
*NL*
building
themselves
a
home
;
and
Marija
had
asked
an
acquaintance
to
read
*NL*
it
to
her
,
and
told
them
that
it
related
to
the
furnishing
of
a
house
.
*NL*
``
Feather
your
nest
,
''
it
ran
--
and
went
on
to
say
that
it
could
furnish
*NL*
all
the
necessary
feathers
for
a
four-room
nest
for
the
ludicrously
*NL*
small
sum
of
seventy-five
dollars
.
The
particularly
important
thing
*NL*
about
this
offer
was
that
only
a
small
part
of
the
money
need
be
had
at
*NL*
once
--
the
rest
one
might
pay
a
few
dollars
every
month
.
Our
friends
had
*NL*
to
have
some
furniture
,
there
was
no
getting
away
from
that
;
but
their
*NL*
little
fund
of
money
had
sunk
so
low
that
they
could
hardly
get
to
sleep
*NL*
at
night
,
and
so
they
fled
to
this
as
their
deliverance
.
There
was
more
*NL*
agony
and
another
paper
for
Elzbieta
to
sign
,
and
then
one
night
when
*NL*
Jurgis
came
home
,
he
was
told
the
breathless
tidings
that
the
furniture
*NL*
had
arrived
and
was
safely
stowed
in
the
house
:
a
parlor
set
of
four
*NL*
pieces
,
a
bedroom
set
of
three
pieces
,
a
dining
room
table
and
four
*NL*
chairs
,
a
toilet
set
with
beautiful
pink
roses
painted
all
over
it
,
*NL*
an
assortment
of
crockery
,
also
with
pink
roses
--
and
so
on
.
One
of
the
*NL*
plates
in
the
set
had
been
found
broken
when
they
unpacked
it
,
and
*NL*
Ona
was
going
to
the
store
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
to
make
them
*NL*
change
it
;
also
they
had
promised
three
saucepans
,
and
there
had
only
*NL*
two
come
,
and
did
Jurgis
think
that
they
were
trying
to
cheat
them
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
they
went
to
the
house
;
and
when
the
men
came
from
work
*NL*
they
ate
a
few
hurried
mouthfuls
at
Aniele
's
,
and
then
set
to
work
at
*NL*
the
task
of
carrying
their
belongings
to
their
new
home
.
The
distance
*NL*
was
in
reality
over
two
miles
,
but
Jurgis
made
two
trips
that
night
,
*NL*
each
time
with
a
huge
pile
of
mattresses
and
bedding
on
his
head
,
with
*NL*
bundles
of
clothing
and
bags
and
things
tied
up
inside
.
Anywhere
else
*NL*
in
Chicago
he
would
have
stood
a
good
chance
of
being
arrested
;
but
the
*NL*
policemen
in
Packingtown
were
apparently
used
to
these
informal
movings
,
*NL*
and
contented
themselves
with
a
cursory
examination
now
and
then
.
It
was
*NL*
quite
wonderful
to
see
how
fine
the
house
looked
,
with
all
the
things
in
*NL*
it
,
even
by
the
dim
light
of
a
lamp
:
it
was
really
home
,
and
almost
as
*NL*
exciting
as
the
placard
had
described
it
.
Ona
was
fairly
dancing
,
and
*NL*
she
and
Cousin
Marija
took
Jurgis
by
the
arm
and
escorted
him
from
room
*NL*
to
room
,
sitting
in
each
chair
by
turns
,
and
then
insisting
that
he
*NL*
should
do
the
same
.
One
chair
squeaked
with
his
great
weight
,
and
they
*NL*
screamed
with
fright
,
and
woke
the
baby
and
brought
everybody
running
.
*NL*
Altogether
it
was
a
great
day
;
and
tired
as
they
were
,
Jurgis
and
Ona
*NL*
sat
up
late
,
contented
simply
to
hold
each
other
and
gaze
in
rapture
*NL*
about
the
room
.
They
were
going
to
be
married
as
soon
as
they
could
get
*NL*
everything
settled
,
and
a
little
spare
money
put
by
;
and
this
was
to
be
*NL*
their
home
--
that
little
room
yonder
would
be
theirs
!
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
truth
a
never-ending
delight
,
the
fixing
up
of
this
house
.
*NL*
They
had
no
money
to
spend
for
the
pleasure
of
spending
,
but
there
*NL*
were
a
few
absolutely
necessary
things
,
and
the
buying
of
these
was
a
*NL*
perpetual
adventure
for
Ona
.
It
must
always
be
done
at
night
,
so
that
*NL*
Jurgis
could
go
along
;
and
even
if
it
were
only
a
pepper
cruet
,
or
half
*NL*
a
dozen
glasses
for
ten
cents
,
that
was
enough
for
an
expedition
.
On
*NL*
Saturday
night
they
came
home
with
a
great
basketful
of
things
,
and
*NL*
spread
them
out
on
the
table
,
while
every
one
stood
round
,
and
the
*NL*
children
climbed
up
on
the
chairs
,
or
howled
to
be
lifted
up
to
see
.
*NL*
There
were
sugar
and
salt
and
tea
and
crackers
,
and
a
can
of
lard
and
*NL*
a
milk
pail
,
and
a
scrubbing
brush
,
and
a
pair
of
shoes
for
the
second
*NL*
oldest
boy
,
and
a
can
of
oil
,
and
a
tack
hammer
,
and
a
pound
of
nails
.
*NL*
These
last
were
to
be
driven
into
the
walls
of
the
kitchen
and
the
*NL*
bedrooms
,
to
hang
things
on
;
and
there
was
a
family
discussion
as
to
the
*NL*
place
where
each
one
was
to
be
driven
.
Then
Jurgis
would
try
to
hammer
,
*NL*
and
hit
his
fingers
because
the
hammer
was
too
small
,
and
get
mad
*NL*
because
Ona
had
refused
to
let
him
pay
fifteen
cents
more
and
get
a
*NL*
bigger
hammer
;
and
Ona
would
be
invited
to
try
it
herself
,
and
hurt
*NL*
her
thumb
,
and
cry
out
,
which
necessitated
the
thumb
's
being
kissed
*NL*
by
Jurgis
.
Finally
,
after
every
one
had
had
a
try
,
the
nails
would
be
*NL*
driven
,
and
something
hung
up
.
Jurgis
had
come
home
with
a
big
packing
*NL*
box
on
his
head
,
and
he
sent
Jonas
to
get
another
that
he
had
bought
.
He
*NL*
meant
to
take
one
side
out
of
these
tomorrow
,
and
put
shelves
in
them
,
*NL*
and
make
them
into
bureaus
and
places
to
keep
things
for
the
bedrooms
.
*NL*
The
nest
which
had
been
advertised
had
not
included
feathers
for
quite
*NL*
so
many
birds
as
there
were
in
this
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
,
of
course
,
put
their
dining
table
in
the
kitchen
,
and
the
*NL*
dining
room
was
used
as
the
bedroom
of
Teta
Elzbieta
and
five
of
her
*NL*
children
.
She
and
the
two
youngest
slept
in
the
only
bed
,
and
the
other
*NL*
three
had
a
mattress
on
the
floor
.
Ona
and
her
cousin
dragged
a
mattress
*NL*
into
the
parlor
and
slept
at
night
,
and
the
three
men
and
the
oldest
boy
*NL*
slept
in
the
other
room
,
having
nothing
but
the
very
level
floor
to
*NL*
rest
on
for
the
present
.
Even
so
,
however
,
they
slept
soundly
--
it
was
*NL*
necessary
for
Teta
Elzbieta
to
pound
more
than
once
on
the
door
at
a
quarter
*NL*
past
five
every
morning
.
She
would
have
ready
a
great
pot
full
of
*NL*
steaming
black
coffee
,
and
oatmeal
and
bread
and
smoked
sausages
;
and
*NL*
then
she
would
fix
them
their
dinner
pails
with
more
thick
slices
of
*NL*
bread
with
lard
between
them
--
they
could
not
afford
butter
--
and
some
*NL*
onions
and
a
piece
of
cheese
,
and
so
they
would
tramp
away
to
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
first
time
in
his
life
that
he
had
ever
really
worked
,
it
*NL*
seemed
to
Jurgis
;
it
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
ever
had
anything
*NL*
to
do
which
took
all
he
had
in
him
.
Jurgis
had
stood
with
the
rest
up
in
*NL*
the
gallery
and
watched
the
men
on
the
killing
beds
,
marveling
at
their
*NL*
speed
and
power
as
if
they
had
been
wonderful
machines
;
it
somehow
never
*NL*
occurred
to
one
to
think
of
the
flesh-and-blood
side
of
it
--
that
is
,
not
*NL*
until
he
actually
got
down
into
the
pit
and
took
off
his
coat
.
Then
he
*NL*
saw
things
in
a
different
light
,
he
got
at
the
inside
of
them
.
The
pace
*NL*
they
set
here
,
it
was
one
that
called
for
every
faculty
of
a
man
--
from
*NL*
the
instant
the
first
steer
fell
till
the
sounding
of
the
noon
whistle
,
*NL*
and
again
from
half-past
twelve
till
heaven
only
knew
what
hour
in
the
*NL*
late
afternoon
or
evening
,
there
was
never
one
instant
's
rest
for
a
man
,
*NL*
for
his
hand
or
his
eye
or
his
brain
.
Jurgis
saw
how
they
managed
it
;
*NL*
there
were
portions
of
the
work
which
determined
the
pace
of
the
rest
,
*NL*
and
for
these
they
had
picked
men
whom
they
paid
high
wages
,
and
whom
*NL*
they
changed
frequently
.
You
might
easily
pick
out
these
pacemakers
,
*NL*
for
they
worked
under
the
eye
of
the
bosses
,
and
they
worked
like
men
*NL*
possessed
.
This
was
called
``
speeding
up
the
gang
,
''
and
if
any
man
could
*NL*
not
keep
up
with
the
pace
,
there
were
hundreds
outside
begging
to
try
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
Jurgis
did
not
mind
it
;
he
rather
enjoyed
it
.
It
saved
him
the
*NL*
necessity
of
flinging
his
arms
about
and
fidgeting
as
he
did
in
most
*NL*
work
.
He
would
laugh
to
himself
as
he
ran
down
the
line
,
darting
a
*NL*
glance
now
and
then
at
the
man
ahead
of
him
.
It
was
not
the
pleasantest
*NL*
work
one
could
think
of
,
but
it
was
necessary
work
;
and
what
more
had
*NL*
a
man
the
right
to
ask
than
a
chance
to
do
something
useful
,
and
to
get
*NL*
good
pay
for
doing
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
So
Jurgis
thought
,
and
so
he
spoke
,
in
his
bold
,
free
way
;
very
much
to
*NL*
his
surprise
,
he
found
that
it
had
a
tendency
to
get
him
into
trouble
.
*NL*
For
most
of
the
men
here
took
a
fearfully
different
view
of
the
thing
.
*NL*
He
was
quite
dismayed
when
he
first
began
to
find
it
out
--
that
most
of
*NL*
the
men
hated
their
work
.
It
seemed
strange
,
it
was
even
terrible
,
*NL*
when
you
came
to
find
out
the
universality
of
the
sentiment
;
but
it
was
*NL*
certainly
the
fact
--
they
hated
their
work
.
They
hated
the
bosses
*NL*
and
they
hated
the
owners
;
they
hated
the
whole
place
,
the
whole
*NL*
neighborhood
--
even
the
whole
city
,
with
an
all-inclusive
hatred
,
bitter
*NL*
and
fierce
.
Women
and
little
children
would
fall
to
cursing
about
it
;
it
*NL*
was
rotten
,
rotten
as
hell
--
everything
was
rotten
.
When
Jurgis
would
ask
*NL*
them
what
they
meant
,
they
would
begin
to
get
suspicious
,
and
content
*NL*
themselves
with
saying
,
``
Never
mind
,
you
stay
here
and
see
for
*NL*
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
first
problems
that
Jurgis
ran
upon
was
that
of
the
unions
.
*NL*
He
had
had
no
experience
with
unions
,
and
he
had
to
have
it
explained
*NL*
to
him
that
the
men
were
banded
together
for
the
purpose
of
fighting
*NL*
for
their
rights
.
Jurgis
asked
them
what
they
meant
by
their
rights
,
a
*NL*
question
in
which
he
was
quite
sincere
,
for
he
had
not
any
idea
of
any
*NL*
rights
that
he
had
,
except
the
right
to
hunt
for
a
job
,
and
do
as
he
was
*NL*
told
when
he
got
it
.
Generally
,
however
,
this
harmless
question
would
*NL*
only
make
his
fellow
workingmen
lose
their
tempers
and
call
him
a
fool
.
*NL*
There
was
a
delegate
of
the
butcher-helpers
'
union
who
came
to
see
*NL*
Jurgis
to
enroll
him
;
and
when
Jurgis
found
that
this
meant
that
he
*NL*
would
have
to
part
with
some
of
his
money
,
he
froze
up
directly
,
and
the
*NL*
delegate
,
who
was
an
Irishman
and
only
knew
a
few
words
of
Lithuanian
,
*NL*
lost
his
temper
and
began
to
threaten
him
.
In
the
end
Jurgis
got
into
a
*NL*
fine
rage
,
and
made
it
sufficiently
plain
that
it
would
take
more
than
*NL*
one
Irishman
to
scare
him
into
a
union
.
Little
by
little
he
gathered
*NL*
that
the
main
thing
the
men
wanted
was
to
put
a
stop
to
the
habit
of
*NL*
``
speeding-up
''
;
they
were
trying
their
best
to
force
a
lessening
of
the
*NL*
pace
,
for
there
were
some
,
they
said
,
who
could
not
keep
up
with
it
,
*NL*
whom
it
was
killing
.
But
Jurgis
had
no
sympathy
with
such
ideas
as
*NL*
this
--
he
could
do
the
work
himself
,
and
so
could
the
rest
of
them
,
he
*NL*
declared
,
if
they
were
good
for
anything
.
If
they
could
n't
do
it
,
let
*NL*
them
go
somewhere
else
.
Jurgis
had
not
studied
the
books
,
and
he
would
*NL*
not
have
known
how
to
pronounce
``
laissez
faire
''
;
but
he
had
been
round
*NL*
the
world
enough
to
know
that
a
man
has
to
shift
for
himself
in
it
,
*NL*
and
that
if
he
gets
the
worst
of
it
,
there
is
nobody
to
listen
to
him
*NL*
holler
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
there
have
been
known
to
be
philosophers
and
plain
men
who
swore
*NL*
by
Malthus
in
the
books
,
and
would
,
nevertheless
,
subscribe
to
a
relief
*NL*
fund
in
time
of
a
famine
.
It
was
the
same
with
Jurgis
,
who
consigned
the
*NL*
unfit
to
destruction
,
while
going
about
all
day
sick
at
heart
because
*NL*
of
his
poor
old
father
,
who
was
wandering
somewhere
in
the
yards
begging
*NL*
for
a
chance
to
earn
his
bread
.
Old
Antanas
had
been
a
worker
ever
since
*NL*
he
was
a
child
;
he
had
run
away
from
home
when
he
was
twelve
,
because
*NL*
his
father
beat
him
for
trying
to
learn
to
read
.
And
he
was
a
faithful
*NL*
man
,
too
;
he
was
a
man
you
might
leave
alone
for
a
month
,
if
only
you
*NL*
had
made
him
understand
what
you
wanted
him
to
do
in
the
meantime
.
And
*NL*
now
here
he
was
,
worn
out
in
soul
and
body
,
and
with
no
more
place
in
*NL*
the
world
than
a
sick
dog
.
He
had
his
home
,
as
it
happened
,
and
some
one
*NL*
who
would
care
for
him
if
he
never
got
a
job
;
but
his
son
could
not
help
*NL*
thinking
,
suppose
this
had
not
been
the
case
.
Antanas
Rudkus
had
been
*NL*
into
every
building
in
Packingtown
by
this
time
,
and
into
nearly
every
*NL*
room
;
he
had
stood
mornings
among
the
crowd
of
applicants
till
the
very
*NL*
policemen
had
come
to
know
his
face
and
to
tell
him
to
go
home
and
give
*NL*
it
up
.
He
had
been
likewise
to
all
the
stores
and
saloons
for
a
mile
*NL*
about
,
begging
for
some
little
thing
to
do
;
and
everywhere
they
had
*NL*
ordered
him
out
,
sometimes
with
curses
,
and
not
once
even
stopping
to
*NL*
ask
him
a
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
,
after
all
,
there
was
a
crack
in
the
fine
structure
of
Jurgis
'
faith
*NL*
in
things
as
they
are
.
The
crack
was
wide
while
Dede
Antanas
was
hunting
*NL*
a
job
--
and
it
was
yet
wider
when
he
finally
got
it
.
For
one
evening
the
*NL*
old
man
came
home
in
a
great
state
of
excitement
,
with
the
tale
that
he
*NL*
had
been
approached
by
a
man
in
one
of
the
corridors
of
the
pickle
rooms
*NL*
of
Durham
's
,
and
asked
what
he
would
pay
to
get
a
job
.
He
had
not
*NL*
known
what
to
make
of
this
at
first
;
but
the
man
had
gone
on
with
*NL*
matter-of-fact
frankness
to
say
that
he
could
get
him
a
job
,
provided
*NL*
that
he
were
willing
to
pay
one-third
of
his
wages
for
it
.
Was
he
a
*NL*
boss
?
Antanas
had
asked
;
to
which
the
man
had
replied
that
that
was
*NL*
nobody
's
business
,
but
that
he
could
do
what
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
had
made
some
friends
by
this
time
,
and
he
sought
one
of
them
and
*NL*
asked
what
this
meant
.
The
friend
,
who
was
named
Tamoszius
Kuszleika
,
*NL*
was
a
sharp
little
man
who
folded
hides
on
the
killing
beds
,
and
he
*NL*
listened
to
what
Jurgis
had
to
say
without
seeming
at
all
surprised
.
*NL*
They
were
common
enough
,
he
said
,
such
cases
of
petty
graft
.
It
was
*NL*
simply
some
boss
who
proposed
to
add
a
little
to
his
income
.
After
*NL*
Jurgis
had
been
there
awhile
he
would
know
that
the
plants
were
simply
*NL*
honeycombed
with
rottenness
of
that
sort
--
the
bosses
grafted
off
the
*NL*
men
,
and
they
grafted
off
each
other
;
and
some
day
the
superintendent
*NL*
would
find
out
about
the
boss
,
and
then
he
would
graft
off
the
boss
.
*NL*
Warming
to
the
subject
,
Tamoszius
went
on
to
explain
the
situation
.
Here
*NL*
was
Durham
's
,
for
instance
,
owned
by
a
man
who
was
trying
to
make
as
*NL*
much
money
out
of
it
as
he
could
,
and
did
not
care
in
the
least
how
he
*NL*
did
it
;
and
underneath
him
,
ranged
in
ranks
and
grades
like
an
army
,
*NL*
were
managers
and
superintendents
and
foremen
,
each
one
driving
the
*NL*
man
next
below
him
and
trying
to
squeeze
out
of
him
as
much
work
as
*NL*
possible
.
And
all
the
men
of
the
same
rank
were
pitted
against
each
*NL*
other
;
the
accounts
of
each
were
kept
separately
,
and
every
man
lived
*NL*
in
terror
of
losing
his
job
,
if
another
made
a
better
record
than
he
.
So
*NL*
from
top
to
bottom
the
place
was
simply
a
seething
caldron
of
jealousies
*NL*
and
hatreds
;
there
was
no
loyalty
or
decency
anywhere
about
it
,
there
*NL*
was
no
place
in
it
where
a
man
counted
for
anything
against
a
dollar
.
*NL*
And
worse
than
there
being
no
decency
,
there
was
not
even
any
honesty
.
*NL*
The
reason
for
that
?
Who
could
say
?
It
must
have
been
old
Durham
in
the
*NL*
beginning
;
it
was
a
heritage
which
the
self-made
merchant
had
left
to
*NL*
his
son
,
along
with
his
millions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
would
find
out
these
things
for
himself
,
if
he
stayed
there
long
*NL*
enough
;
it
was
the
men
who
had
to
do
all
the
dirty
jobs
,
and
so
there
*NL*
was
no
deceiving
them
;
and
they
caught
the
spirit
of
the
place
,
and
did
*NL*
like
all
the
rest
.
Jurgis
had
come
there
,
and
thought
he
was
going
to
*NL*
make
himself
useful
,
and
rise
and
become
a
skilled
man
;
but
he
would
*NL*
soon
find
out
his
error
--
for
nobody
rose
in
Packingtown
by
doing
good
*NL*
work
.
You
could
lay
that
down
for
a
rule
--
if
you
met
a
man
who
was
*NL*
rising
in
Packingtown
,
you
met
a
knave
.
That
man
who
had
been
sent
to
*NL*
Jurgis
'
father
by
the
boss
,
he
would
rise
;
the
man
who
told
tales
*NL*
and
spied
upon
his
fellows
would
rise
;
but
the
man
who
minded
his
own
*NL*
business
and
did
his
work
--
why
,
they
would
``
speed
him
up
''
till
they
had
*NL*
worn
him
out
,
and
then
they
would
throw
him
into
the
gutter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
went
home
with
his
head
buzzing
.
Yet
he
could
not
bring
himself
*NL*
to
believe
such
things
--
no
,
it
could
not
be
so
.
Tamoszius
was
simply
*NL*
another
of
the
grumblers
.
He
was
a
man
who
spent
all
his
time
fiddling
;
*NL*
and
he
would
go
to
parties
at
night
and
not
get
home
till
sunrise
,
and
*NL*
so
of
course
he
did
not
feel
like
work
.
Then
,
too
,
he
was
a
puny
little
*NL*
chap
;
and
so
he
had
been
left
behind
in
the
race
,
and
that
was
why
he
*NL*
was
sore
.
And
yet
so
many
strange
things
kept
coming
to
Jurgis
'
notice
*NL*
every
day
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
tried
to
persuade
his
father
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
offer
.
*NL*
But
old
Antanas
had
begged
until
he
was
worn
out
,
and
all
his
courage
*NL*
was
gone
;
he
wanted
a
job
,
any
sort
of
a
job
.
So
the
next
day
he
went
*NL*
and
found
the
man
who
had
spoken
to
him
,
and
promised
to
bring
him
a
*NL*
third
of
all
he
earned
;
and
that
same
day
he
was
put
to
work
in
Durham
's
*NL*
cellars
.
It
was
a
``
pickle
room
,
''
where
there
was
never
a
dry
spot
to
*NL*
stand
upon
,
and
so
he
had
to
take
nearly
the
whole
of
his
first
week
's
*NL*
earnings
to
buy
him
a
pair
of
heavy-soled
boots
.
He
was
a
``
squeedgie
''
*NL*
man
;
his
job
was
to
go
about
all
day
with
a
long-handled
mop
,
swabbing
*NL*
up
the
floor
.
Except
that
it
was
damp
and
dark
,
it
was
not
an
unpleasant
*NL*
job
,
in
summer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
Antanas
Rudkus
was
the
meekest
man
that
God
ever
put
on
earth
;
and
*NL*
so
Jurgis
found
it
a
striking
confirmation
of
what
the
men
all
said
,
*NL*
that
his
father
had
been
at
work
only
two
days
before
he
came
home
as
*NL*
bitter
as
any
of
them
,
and
cursing
Durham
's
with
all
the
power
of
his
*NL*
soul
.
For
they
had
set
him
to
cleaning
out
the
traps
;
and
the
family
*NL*
sat
round
and
listened
in
wonder
while
he
told
them
what
that
meant
.
It
*NL*
seemed
that
he
was
working
in
the
room
where
the
men
prepared
the
beef
*NL*
for
canning
,
and
the
beef
had
lain
in
vats
full
of
chemicals
,
and
men
*NL*
with
great
forks
speared
it
out
and
dumped
it
into
trucks
,
to
be
taken
*NL*
to
the
cooking
room
.
When
they
had
speared
out
all
they
could
reach
,
*NL*
they
emptied
the
vat
on
the
floor
,
and
then
with
shovels
scraped
up
the
*NL*
balance
and
dumped
it
into
the
truck
.
This
floor
was
filthy
,
yet
*NL*
they
set
Antanas
with
his
mop
slopping
the
``
pickle
''
into
a
hole
that
*NL*
connected
with
a
sink
,
where
it
was
caught
and
used
over
again
forever
;
*NL*
and
if
that
were
not
enough
,
there
was
a
trap
in
the
pipe
,
where
all
the
*NL*
scraps
of
meat
and
odds
and
ends
of
refuse
were
caught
,
and
every
few
*NL*
days
it
was
the
old
man
's
task
to
clean
these
out
,
and
shovel
their
*NL*
contents
into
one
of
the
trucks
with
the
rest
of
the
meat
!
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
experience
of
Antanas
;
and
then
there
came
also
Jonas
and
*NL*
Marija
with
tales
to
tell
.
Marija
was
working
for
one
of
the
independent
*NL*
packers
,
and
was
quite
beside
herself
and
outrageous
with
triumph
over
*NL*
the
sums
of
money
she
was
making
as
a
painter
of
cans
.
But
one
day
she
*NL*
walked
home
with
a
pale-faced
little
woman
who
worked
opposite
to
her
,
*NL*
Jadvyga
Marcinkus
by
name
,
and
Jadvyga
told
her
how
she
,
Marija
,
had
*NL*
chanced
to
get
her
job
.
She
had
taken
the
place
of
an
Irishwoman
who
had
*NL*
been
working
in
that
factory
ever
since
any
one
could
remember
.
For
over
*NL*
fifteen
years
,
so
she
declared
.
Mary
Dennis
was
her
name
,
and
a
long
*NL*
time
ago
she
had
been
seduced
,
and
had
a
little
boy
;
he
was
a
cripple
,
*NL*
and
an
epileptic
,
but
still
he
was
all
that
she
had
in
the
world
to
*NL*
love
,
and
they
had
lived
in
a
little
room
alone
somewhere
back
of
*NL*
Halsted
Street
,
where
the
Irish
were
.
Mary
had
had
consumption
,
and
all
*NL*
day
long
you
might
hear
her
coughing
as
she
worked
;
of
late
she
had
been
*NL*
going
all
to
pieces
,
and
when
Marija
came
,
the
``
forelady
''
had
suddenly
*NL*
decided
to
turn
her
off
.
The
forelady
had
to
come
up
to
a
certain
*NL*
standard
herself
,
and
could
not
stop
for
sick
people
,
Jadvyga
explained
.
*NL*
The
fact
that
Mary
had
been
there
so
long
had
not
made
any
difference
*NL*
to
her
--
it
was
doubtful
if
she
even
knew
that
,
for
both
the
forelady
and
*NL*
the
superintendent
were
new
people
,
having
only
been
there
two
or
three
*NL*
years
themselves
.
Jadvyga
did
not
know
what
had
become
of
the
poor
*NL*
creature
;
she
would
have
gone
to
see
her
,
but
had
been
sick
herself
.
She
*NL*
had
pains
in
her
back
all
the
time
,
Jadvyga
explained
,
and
feared
*NL*
that
she
had
womb
trouble
.
It
was
not
fit
work
for
a
woman
,
handling
*NL*
fourteen-pound
cans
all
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
striking
circumstance
that
Jonas
,
too
,
had
gotten
his
job
by
*NL*
the
misfortune
of
some
other
person
.
Jonas
pushed
a
truck
loaded
with
*NL*
hams
from
the
smoke
rooms
on
to
an
elevator
,
and
thence
to
the
packing
*NL*
rooms
.
The
trucks
were
all
of
iron
,
and
heavy
,
and
they
put
about
*NL*
threescore
hams
on
each
of
them
,
a
load
of
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
*NL*
ton
.
On
the
uneven
floor
it
was
a
task
for
a
man
to
start
one
of
these
*NL*
trucks
,
unless
he
was
a
giant
;
and
when
it
was
once
started
he
naturally
*NL*
tried
his
best
to
keep
it
going
.
There
was
always
the
boss
prowling
*NL*
about
,
and
if
there
was
a
second
's
delay
he
would
fall
to
cursing
;
*NL*
Lithuanians
and
Slovaks
and
such
,
who
could
not
understand
what
was
said
*NL*
to
them
,
the
bosses
were
wont
to
kick
about
the
place
like
so
many
*NL*
dogs
.
Therefore
these
trucks
went
for
the
most
part
on
the
run
;
and
the
*NL*
predecessor
of
Jonas
had
been
jammed
against
the
wall
by
one
and
crushed
*NL*
in
a
horrible
and
nameless
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
of
these
were
sinister
incidents
;
but
they
were
trifles
compared
to
*NL*
what
Jurgis
saw
with
his
own
eyes
before
long
.
One
curious
thing
he
*NL*
had
noticed
,
the
very
first
day
,
in
his
profession
of
shoveler
of
guts
;
*NL*
which
was
the
sharp
trick
of
the
floor
bosses
whenever
there
chanced
to
*NL*
come
a
``
slunk
''
calf
.
Any
man
who
knows
anything
about
butchering
knows
*NL*
that
the
flesh
of
a
cow
that
is
about
to
calve
,
or
has
just
calved
,
is
*NL*
not
fit
for
food
.
A
good
many
of
these
came
every
day
to
the
packing
*NL*
houses
--
and
,
of
course
,
if
they
had
chosen
,
it
would
have
been
an
easy
*NL*
matter
for
the
packers
to
keep
them
till
they
were
fit
for
food
.
But
*NL*
for
the
saving
of
time
and
fodder
,
it
was
the
law
that
cows
of
that
sort
*NL*
came
along
with
the
others
,
and
whoever
noticed
it
would
tell
the
*NL*
boss
,
and
the
boss
would
start
up
a
conversation
with
the
government
*NL*
inspector
,
and
the
two
would
stroll
away
.
So
in
a
trice
the
carcass
of
*NL*
the
cow
would
be
cleaned
out
,
and
entrails
would
have
vanished
;
it
was
*NL*
Jurgis
'
task
to
slide
them
into
the
trap
,
calves
and
all
,
and
on
the
*NL*
floor
below
they
took
out
these
``
slunk
''
calves
,
and
butchered
them
for
*NL*
meat
,
and
used
even
the
skins
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
a
man
slipped
and
hurt
his
leg
;
and
that
afternoon
,
when
the
*NL*
last
of
the
cattle
had
been
disposed
of
,
and
the
men
were
leaving
,
*NL*
Jurgis
was
ordered
to
remain
and
do
some
special
work
which
this
injured
*NL*
man
had
usually
done
.
It
was
late
,
almost
dark
,
and
the
government
*NL*
inspectors
had
all
gone
,
and
there
were
only
a
dozen
or
two
of
men
on
*NL*
the
floor
.
That
day
they
had
killed
about
four
thousand
cattle
,
and
*NL*
these
cattle
had
come
in
freight
trains
from
far
states
,
and
some
of
*NL*
them
had
got
hurt
.
There
were
some
with
broken
legs
,
and
some
with
gored
*NL*
sides
;
there
were
some
that
had
died
,
from
what
cause
no
one
could
*NL*
say
;
and
they
were
all
to
be
disposed
of
,
here
in
darkness
and
silence
.
*NL*
``
Downers
,
''
the
men
called
them
;
and
the
packing
house
had
a
special
*NL*
elevator
upon
which
they
were
raised
to
the
killing
beds
,
where
the
gang
*NL*
proceeded
to
handle
them
,
with
an
air
of
businesslike
nonchalance
which
*NL*
said
plainer
than
any
words
that
it
was
a
matter
of
everyday
routine
.
It
*NL*
took
a
couple
of
hours
to
get
them
out
of
the
way
,
and
in
the
end
Jurgis
*NL*
saw
them
go
into
the
chilling
rooms
with
the
rest
of
the
meat
,
being
*NL*
carefully
scattered
here
and
there
so
that
they
could
not
be
identified
.
*NL*
When
he
came
home
that
night
he
was
in
a
very
somber
mood
,
having
begun
*NL*
to
see
at
last
how
those
might
be
right
who
had
laughed
at
him
for
his
*NL*
faith
in
America
.

Chapter
6
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
and
Ona
were
very
much
in
love
;
they
had
waited
a
long
time
--
it
*NL*
was
now
well
into
the
second
year
,
and
Jurgis
judged
everything
by
the
*NL*
criterion
of
its
helping
or
hindering
their
union
.
All
his
thoughts
were
*NL*
there
;
he
accepted
the
family
because
it
was
a
part
of
Ona
.
And
he
was
*NL*
interested
in
the
house
because
it
was
to
be
Ona
's
home
.
Even
the
tricks
*NL*
and
cruelties
he
saw
at
Durham
's
had
little
meaning
for
him
just
then
,
*NL*
save
as
they
might
happen
to
affect
his
future
with
Ona
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
marriage
would
have
been
at
once
,
if
they
had
had
their
way
;
but
*NL*
this
would
mean
that
they
would
have
to
do
without
any
wedding
feast
,
*NL*
and
when
they
suggested
this
they
came
into
conflict
with
the
old
*NL*
people
.
To
Teta
Elzbieta
especially
the
very
suggestion
was
an
*NL*
affliction
.
What
!
she
would
cry
.
To
be
married
on
the
roadside
like
a
*NL*
parcel
of
beggars
!
No
!
No
!
--
Elzbieta
had
some
traditions
behind
her
;
*NL*
she
had
been
a
person
of
importance
in
her
girlhood
--
had
lived
on
a
big
*NL*
estate
and
had
servants
,
and
might
have
married
well
and
been
a
lady
,
*NL*
but
for
the
fact
that
there
had
been
nine
daughters
and
no
sons
in
the
*NL*
family
.
Even
so
,
however
,
she
knew
what
was
decent
,
and
clung
to
her
*NL*
traditions
with
desperation
.
They
were
not
going
to
lose
all
caste
,
even
*NL*
if
they
had
come
to
be
unskilled
laborers
in
Packingtown
;
and
that
Ona
*NL*
had
even
talked
of
omitting
a
_
veselija
_
was
enough
to
keep
her
stepmother
*NL*
lying
awake
all
night
.
It
was
in
vain
for
them
to
say
that
they
had
*NL*
so
few
friends
;
they
were
bound
to
have
friends
in
time
,
and
then
the
*NL*
friends
would
talk
about
it
.
They
must
not
give
up
what
was
right
for
a
*NL*
little
money
--
if
they
did
,
the
money
would
never
do
them
any
good
,
they
*NL*
could
depend
upon
that
.
And
Elzbieta
would
call
upon
Dede
Antanas
to
*NL*
support
her
;
there
was
a
fear
in
the
souls
of
these
two
,
lest
this
*NL*
journey
to
a
new
country
might
somehow
undermine
the
old
home
virtues
of
*NL*
their
children
.
The
very
first
Sunday
they
had
all
been
taken
to
mass
;
*NL*
and
poor
as
they
were
,
Elzbieta
had
felt
it
advisable
to
invest
a
little
*NL*
of
her
resources
in
a
representation
of
the
babe
of
Bethlehem
,
made
*NL*
in
plaster
,
and
painted
in
brilliant
colors
.
Though
it
was
only
a
foot
*NL*
high
,
there
was
a
shrine
with
four
snow-white
steeples
,
and
the
Virgin
*NL*
standing
with
her
child
in
her
arms
,
and
the
kings
and
shepherds
and
*NL*
wise
men
bowing
down
before
him
.
It
had
cost
fifty
cents
;
but
Elzbieta
*NL*
had
a
feeling
that
money
spent
for
such
things
was
not
to
be
counted
too
*NL*
closely
,
it
would
come
back
in
hidden
ways
.
The
piece
was
beautiful
on
*NL*
the
parlor
mantel
,
and
one
could
not
have
a
home
without
some
sort
of
*NL*
ornament
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cost
of
the
wedding
feast
would
,
of
course
,
be
returned
to
them
;
*NL*
but
the
problem
was
to
raise
it
even
temporarily
.
They
had
been
in
the
*NL*
neighborhood
so
short
a
time
that
they
could
not
get
much
credit
,
and
*NL*
there
was
no
one
except
Szedvilas
from
whom
they
could
borrow
even
a
*NL*
little
.
Evening
after
evening
Jurgis
and
Ona
would
sit
and
figure
the
*NL*
expenses
,
calculating
the
term
of
their
separation
.
They
could
not
*NL*
possibly
manage
it
decently
for
less
than
two
hundred
dollars
,
and
even
*NL*
though
they
were
welcome
to
count
in
the
whole
of
the
earnings
of
Marija
*NL*
and
Jonas
,
as
a
loan
,
they
could
not
hope
to
raise
this
sum
in
less
*NL*
than
four
or
five
months
.
So
Ona
began
thinking
of
seeking
employment
*NL*
herself
,
saying
that
if
she
had
even
ordinarily
good
luck
,
she
might
be
*NL*
able
to
take
two
months
off
the
time
.
They
were
just
beginning
to
adjust
*NL*
themselves
to
this
necessity
,
when
out
of
the
clear
sky
there
fell
a
*NL*
thunderbolt
upon
them
--
a
calamity
that
scattered
all
their
hopes
to
the
*NL*
four
winds
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
a
block
away
from
them
there
lived
another
Lithuanian
family
,
*NL*
consisting
of
an
elderly
widow
and
one
grown
son
;
their
name
was
*NL*
Majauszkis
,
and
our
friends
struck
up
an
acquaintance
with
them
before
*NL*
long
.
One
evening
they
came
over
for
a
visit
,
and
naturally
the
first
*NL*
subject
upon
which
the
conversation
turned
was
the
neighborhood
and
its
*NL*
history
;
and
then
Grandmother
Majauszkiene
,
as
the
old
lady
was
called
,
*NL*
proceeded
to
recite
to
them
a
string
of
horrors
that
fairly
froze
their
*NL*
blood
.
She
was
a
wrinkled-up
and
wizened
personage
--
she
must
have
been
*NL*
eighty
--
and
as
she
mumbled
the
grim
story
through
her
toothless
gums
,
*NL*
she
seemed
a
very
old
witch
to
them
.
Grandmother
Majauszkiene
had
lived
*NL*
in
the
midst
of
misfortune
so
long
that
it
had
come
to
be
her
element
,
*NL*
and
she
talked
about
starvation
,
sickness
,
and
death
as
other
people
*NL*
might
about
weddings
and
holidays
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
thing
came
gradually
.
In
the
first
place
as
to
the
house
they
*NL*
had
bought
,
it
was
not
new
at
all
,
as
they
had
supposed
;
it
was
about
*NL*
fifteen
years
old
,
and
there
was
nothing
new
upon
it
but
the
paint
,
*NL*
which
was
so
bad
that
it
needed
to
be
put
on
new
every
year
or
two
.
The
*NL*
house
was
one
of
a
whole
row
that
was
built
by
a
company
which
existed
*NL*
to
make
money
by
swindling
poor
people
.
The
family
had
paid
fifteen
*NL*
hundred
dollars
for
it
,
and
it
had
not
cost
the
builders
five
hundred
,
*NL*
when
it
was
new
.
Grandmother
Majauszkiene
knew
that
because
her
son
*NL*
belonged
to
a
political
organization
with
a
contractor
who
put
up
*NL*
exactly
such
houses
.
They
used
the
very
flimsiest
and
cheapest
material
;
*NL*
they
built
the
houses
a
dozen
at
a
time
,
and
they
cared
about
nothing
at
*NL*
all
except
the
outside
shine
.
The
family
could
take
her
word
as
to
the
*NL*
trouble
they
would
have
,
for
she
had
been
through
it
all
--
she
and
her
*NL*
son
had
bought
their
house
in
exactly
the
same
way
.
They
had
fooled
the
*NL*
company
,
however
,
for
her
son
was
a
skilled
man
,
who
made
as
high
as
a
*NL*
hundred
dollars
a
month
,
and
as
he
had
had
sense
enough
not
to
marry
,
*NL*
they
had
been
able
to
pay
for
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Grandmother
Majauszkiene
saw
that
her
friends
were
puzzled
at
this
*NL*
remark
;
they
did
not
quite
see
how
paying
for
the
house
was
``
fooling
the
*NL*
company
.
''
Evidently
they
were
very
inexperienced
.
Cheap
as
the
houses
*NL*
were
,
they
were
sold
with
the
idea
that
the
people
who
bought
them
would
*NL*
not
be
able
to
pay
for
them
.
When
they
failed
--
if
it
were
only
by
a
*NL*
single
month
--
they
would
lose
the
house
and
all
that
they
had
paid
on
*NL*
it
,
and
then
the
company
would
sell
it
over
again
.
And
did
they
often
*NL*
get
a
chance
to
do
that
?
Dieve
!
-LRB-
Grandmother
Majauszkiene
raised
her
*NL*
hands
.
-RRB-
They
did
it
--
how
often
no
one
could
say
,
but
certainly
more
than
*NL*
half
of
the
time
.
They
might
ask
any
one
who
knew
anything
at
all
about
*NL*
Packingtown
as
to
that
;
she
had
been
living
here
ever
since
this
house
*NL*
was
built
,
and
she
could
tell
them
all
about
it
.
And
had
it
ever
been
*NL*
sold
before
?
Susimilkie
!
Why
,
since
it
had
been
built
,
no
less
than
four
*NL*
families
that
their
informant
could
name
had
tried
to
buy
it
and
failed
.
*NL*
She
would
tell
them
a
little
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
family
had
been
Germans
.
The
families
had
all
been
of
*NL*
different
nationalities
--
there
had
been
a
representative
of
several
*NL*
races
that
had
displaced
each
other
in
the
stockyards
.
Grandmother
*NL*
Majauszkiene
had
come
to
America
with
her
son
at
a
time
when
so
far
as
*NL*
she
knew
there
was
only
one
other
Lithuanian
family
in
the
district
;
*NL*
the
workers
had
all
been
Germans
then
--
skilled
cattle
butchers
that
the
*NL*
packers
had
brought
from
abroad
to
start
the
business
.
Afterward
,
as
*NL*
cheaper
labor
had
come
,
these
Germans
had
moved
away
.
The
next
were
the
*NL*
Irish
--
there
had
been
six
or
eight
years
when
Packingtown
had
been
a
*NL*
regular
Irish
city
.
There
were
a
few
colonies
of
them
still
here
,
enough
*NL*
to
run
all
the
unions
and
the
police
force
and
get
all
the
graft
;
but
*NL*
most
of
those
who
were
working
in
the
packing
houses
had
gone
away
at
*NL*
the
next
drop
in
wages
--
after
the
big
strike
.
The
Bohemians
had
come
*NL*
then
,
and
after
them
the
Poles
.
People
said
that
old
man
Durham
himself
*NL*
was
responsible
for
these
immigrations
;
he
had
sworn
that
he
would
fix
*NL*
the
people
of
Packingtown
so
that
they
would
never
again
call
a
strike
*NL*
on
him
,
and
so
he
had
sent
his
agents
into
every
city
and
village
in
*NL*
Europe
to
spread
the
tale
of
the
chances
of
work
and
high
wages
at
the
*NL*
stockyards
.
The
people
had
come
in
hordes
;
and
old
Durham
had
squeezed
*NL*
them
tighter
and
tighter
,
speeding
them
up
and
grinding
them
to
pieces
*NL*
and
sending
for
new
ones
.
The
Poles
,
who
had
come
by
tens
of
thousands
,
*NL*
had
been
driven
to
the
wall
by
the
Lithuanians
,
and
now
the
Lithuanians
*NL*
were
giving
way
to
the
Slovaks
.
Who
there
was
poorer
and
more
miserable
*NL*
than
the
Slovaks
,
Grandmother
Majauszkiene
had
no
idea
,
but
the
packers
*NL*
would
find
them
,
never
fear
.
It
was
easy
to
bring
them
,
for
wages
were
*NL*
really
much
higher
,
and
it
was
only
when
it
was
too
late
that
the
poor
*NL*
people
found
out
that
everything
else
was
higher
too
.
They
were
like
*NL*
rats
in
a
trap
,
that
was
the
truth
;
and
more
of
them
were
piling
in
*NL*
every
day
.
By
and
by
they
would
have
their
revenge
,
though
,
for
the
*NL*
thing
was
getting
beyond
human
endurance
,
and
the
people
would
rise
and
*NL*
murder
the
packers
.
Grandmother
Majauszkiene
was
a
socialist
,
or
some
*NL*
such
strange
thing
;
another
son
of
hers
was
working
in
the
mines
of
*NL*
Siberia
,
and
the
old
lady
herself
had
made
speeches
in
her
time
--
which
*NL*
made
her
seem
all
the
more
terrible
to
her
present
auditors
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
called
her
back
to
the
story
of
the
house
.
The
German
family
had
*NL*
been
a
good
sort
.
To
be
sure
there
had
been
a
great
many
of
them
,
which
*NL*
was
a
common
failing
in
Packingtown
;
but
they
had
worked
hard
,
and
the
*NL*
father
had
been
a
steady
man
,
and
they
had
a
good
deal
more
than
half
*NL*
paid
for
the
house
.
But
he
had
been
killed
in
an
elevator
accident
in
*NL*
Durham
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
there
had
come
the
Irish
,
and
there
had
been
lots
of
them
,
too
;
*NL*
the
husband
drank
and
beat
the
children
--
the
neighbors
could
hear
them
*NL*
shrieking
any
night
.
They
were
behind
with
their
rent
all
the
time
,
*NL*
but
the
company
was
good
to
them
;
there
was
some
politics
back
of
that
,
*NL*
Grandmother
Majauszkiene
could
not
say
just
what
,
but
the
Laffertys
had
*NL*
belonged
to
the
``
War
Whoop
League
,
''
which
was
a
sort
of
political
club
*NL*
of
all
the
thugs
and
rowdies
in
the
district
;
and
if
you
belonged
to
*NL*
that
,
you
could
never
be
arrested
for
anything
.
Once
upon
a
time
old
*NL*
Lafferty
had
been
caught
with
a
gang
that
had
stolen
cows
from
several
*NL*
of
the
poor
people
of
the
neighborhood
and
butchered
them
in
an
old
*NL*
shanty
back
of
the
yards
and
sold
them
.
He
had
been
in
jail
only
three
*NL*
days
for
it
,
and
had
come
out
laughing
,
and
had
not
even
lost
his
place
*NL*
in
the
packing
house
.
He
had
gone
all
to
ruin
with
the
drink
,
however
,
*NL*
and
lost
his
power
;
one
of
his
sons
,
who
was
a
good
man
,
had
kept
him
*NL*
and
the
family
up
for
a
year
or
two
,
but
then
he
had
got
sick
with
*NL*
consumption
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
another
thing
,
Grandmother
Majauszkiene
interrupted
*NL*
herself
--
this
house
was
unlucky
.
Every
family
that
lived
in
it
,
some
one
*NL*
was
sure
to
get
consumption
.
Nobody
could
tell
why
that
was
;
there
must
*NL*
be
something
about
the
house
,
or
the
way
it
was
built
--
some
folks
said
*NL*
it
was
because
the
building
had
been
begun
in
the
dark
of
the
moon
.
*NL*
There
were
dozens
of
houses
that
way
in
Packingtown
.
Sometimes
there
*NL*
would
be
a
particular
room
that
you
could
point
out
--
if
anybody
slept
in
*NL*
that
room
he
was
just
as
good
as
dead
.
With
this
house
it
had
been
the
*NL*
Irish
first
;
and
then
a
Bohemian
family
had
lost
a
child
of
it
--
though
,
*NL*
to
be
sure
,
that
was
uncertain
,
since
it
was
hard
to
tell
what
was
the
*NL*
matter
with
children
who
worked
in
the
yards
.
In
those
days
there
had
*NL*
been
no
law
about
the
age
of
children
--
the
packers
had
worked
all
but
*NL*
the
babies
.
At
this
remark
the
family
looked
puzzled
,
and
Grandmother
*NL*
Majauszkiene
again
had
to
make
an
explanation
--
that
it
was
against
the
*NL*
law
for
children
to
work
before
they
were
sixteen
.
What
was
the
sense
of
*NL*
that
?
they
asked
.
They
had
been
thinking
of
letting
little
Stanislovas
*NL*
go
to
work
.
Well
,
there
was
no
need
to
worry
,
Grandmother
Majauszkiene
*NL*
said
--
the
law
made
no
difference
except
that
it
forced
people
to
lie
*NL*
about
the
ages
of
their
children
.
One
would
like
to
know
what
the
*NL*
lawmakers
expected
them
to
do
;
there
were
families
that
had
no
possible
*NL*
means
of
support
except
the
children
,
and
the
law
provided
them
no
*NL*
other
way
of
getting
a
living
.
Very
often
a
man
could
get
no
work
in
*NL*
Packingtown
for
months
,
while
a
child
could
go
and
get
a
place
easily
;
*NL*
there
was
always
some
new
machine
,
by
which
the
packers
could
get
as
*NL*
much
work
out
of
a
child
as
they
had
been
able
to
get
out
of
a
man
,
and
*NL*
for
a
third
of
the
pay
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
come
back
to
the
house
again
,
it
was
the
woman
of
the
next
family
*NL*
that
had
died
.
That
was
after
they
had
been
there
nearly
four
years
,
and
*NL*
this
woman
had
had
twins
regularly
every
year
--
and
there
had
been
more
*NL*
than
you
could
count
when
they
moved
in
.
After
she
died
the
man
would
*NL*
go
to
work
all
day
and
leave
them
to
shift
for
themselves
--
the
neighbors
*NL*
would
help
them
now
and
then
,
for
they
would
almost
freeze
to
death
.
At
*NL*
the
end
there
were
three
days
that
they
were
alone
,
before
it
was
found
*NL*
out
that
the
father
was
dead
.
He
was
a
``
floorsman
''
at
Jones
's
,
and
a
*NL*
wounded
steer
had
broken
loose
and
mashed
him
against
a
pillar
.
Then
the
*NL*
children
had
been
taken
away
,
and
the
company
had
sold
the
house
that
*NL*
very
same
week
to
a
party
of
emigrants
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
this
grim
old
women
went
on
with
her
tale
of
horrors
.
How
much
of
it
*NL*
was
exaggeration
--
who
could
tell
?
It
was
only
too
plausible
.
There
*NL*
was
that
about
consumption
,
for
instance
.
They
knew
nothing
about
*NL*
consumption
whatever
,
except
that
it
made
people
cough
;
and
for
two
*NL*
weeks
they
had
been
worrying
about
a
coughing-spell
of
Antanas
.
It
*NL*
seemed
to
shake
him
all
over
,
and
it
never
stopped
;
you
could
see
a
red
*NL*
stain
wherever
he
had
spit
upon
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
all
these
things
were
as
nothing
to
what
came
a
little
later
.
*NL*
They
had
begun
to
question
the
old
lady
as
to
why
one
family
had
been
*NL*
unable
to
pay
,
trying
to
show
her
by
figures
that
it
ought
to
have
been
*NL*
possible
;
and
Grandmother
Majauszkiene
had
disputed
their
figures
--
``
You
*NL*
say
twelve
dollars
a
month
;
but
that
does
not
include
the
interest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
they
stared
at
her
.
``
Interest
!
''
they
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Interest
on
the
money
you
still
owe
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
we
do
n't
have
to
pay
any
interest
!
''
they
exclaimed
,
three
or
four
*NL*
at
once
.
``
We
only
have
to
pay
twelve
dollars
each
month
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
for
this
she
laughed
at
them
.
``
You
are
like
all
the
rest
,
''
she
said
;
*NL*
``
they
trick
you
and
eat
you
alive
.
They
never
sell
the
houses
without
*NL*
interest
.
Get
your
deed
,
and
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
with
a
horrible
sinking
of
the
heart
,
Teta
Elzbieta
unlocked
her
*NL*
bureau
and
brought
out
the
paper
that
had
already
caused
them
so
many
*NL*
agonies
.
Now
they
sat
round
,
scarcely
breathing
,
while
the
old
lady
,
who
*NL*
could
read
English
,
ran
over
it
.
``
Yes
,
''
she
said
,
finally
,
``
here
it
is
,
*NL*
of
course
:
`
With
interest
thereon
monthly
,
at
the
rate
of
seven
per
cent
*NL*
per
annum
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
there
followed
a
dead
silence
.
``
What
does
that
mean
?
''
asked
Jurgis
*NL*
finally
,
almost
in
a
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
means
,
''
replied
the
other
,
``
that
you
have
to
pay
them
seven
*NL*
dollars
next
month
,
as
well
as
the
twelve
dollars
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
again
there
was
not
a
sound
.
It
was
sickening
,
like
a
nightmare
,
*NL*
in
which
suddenly
something
gives
way
beneath
you
,
and
you
feel
yourself
*NL*
sinking
,
sinking
,
down
into
bottomless
abysses
.
As
if
in
a
flash
of
*NL*
lightning
they
saw
themselves
--
victims
of
a
relentless
fate
,
cornered
,
*NL*
trapped
,
in
the
grip
of
destruction
.
All
the
fair
structure
of
their
*NL*
hopes
came
crashing
about
their
ears
.
--
And
all
the
time
the
old
woman
*NL*
was
going
on
talking
.
They
wished
that
she
would
be
still
;
her
voice
*NL*
sounded
like
the
croaking
of
some
dismal
raven
.
Jurgis
sat
with
his
*NL*
hands
clenched
and
beads
of
perspiration
on
his
forehead
,
and
there
was
*NL*
a
great
lump
in
Ona
's
throat
,
choking
her
.
Then
suddenly
Teta
Elzbieta
*NL*
broke
the
silence
with
a
wail
,
and
Marija
began
to
wring
her
hands
and
*NL*
sob
,
``
Ai
!
Ai
!
Beda
man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
their
outcry
did
them
no
good
,
of
course
.
There
sat
Grandmother
*NL*
Majauszkiene
,
unrelenting
,
typifying
fate
.
No
,
of
course
it
was
not
*NL*
fair
,
but
then
fairness
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
.
And
of
course
they
*NL*
had
not
known
it
.
They
had
not
been
intended
to
know
it
.
But
it
was
in
*NL*
the
deed
,
and
that
was
all
that
was
necessary
,
as
they
would
find
when
*NL*
the
time
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
Somehow
or
other
they
got
rid
of
their
guest
,
and
then
they
passed
a
*NL*
night
of
lamentation
.
The
children
woke
up
and
found
out
that
something
*NL*
was
wrong
,
and
they
wailed
and
would
not
be
comforted
.
In
the
morning
,
*NL*
of
course
,
most
of
them
had
to
go
to
work
,
the
packing
houses
would
not
*NL*
stop
for
their
sorrows
;
but
by
seven
o'clock
Ona
and
her
stepmother
were
*NL*
standing
at
the
door
of
the
office
of
the
agent
.
Yes
,
he
told
them
,
when
*NL*
he
came
,
it
was
quite
true
that
they
would
have
to
pay
interest
.
And
*NL*
then
Teta
Elzbieta
broke
forth
into
protestations
and
reproaches
,
so
*NL*
that
the
people
outside
stopped
and
peered
in
at
the
window
.
The
agent
*NL*
was
as
bland
as
ever
.
He
was
deeply
pained
,
he
said
.
He
had
not
told
*NL*
them
,
simply
because
he
had
supposed
they
would
understand
that
they
had
*NL*
to
pay
interest
upon
their
debt
,
as
a
matter
of
course
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
they
came
away
,
and
Ona
went
down
to
the
yards
,
and
at
noontime
saw
*NL*
Jurgis
and
told
him
.
Jurgis
took
it
stolidly
--
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
*NL*
it
by
this
time
.
It
was
part
of
fate
;
they
would
manage
it
somehow
--
he
*NL*
made
his
usual
answer
,
``
I
will
work
harder
.
''
It
would
upset
their
plans
*NL*
for
a
time
;
and
it
would
perhaps
be
necessary
for
Ona
to
get
work
*NL*
after
all
.
Then
Ona
added
that
Teta
Elzbieta
had
decided
that
little
*NL*
Stanislovas
would
have
to
work
too
.
It
was
not
fair
to
let
Jurgis
and
*NL*
her
support
the
family
--
the
family
would
have
to
help
as
it
could
.
*NL*
Previously
Jurgis
had
scouted
this
idea
,
but
now
knit
his
brows
and
*NL*
nodded
his
head
slowly
--
yes
,
perhaps
it
would
be
best
;
they
would
all
*NL*
have
to
make
some
sacrifices
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
Ona
set
out
that
day
to
hunt
for
work
;
and
at
night
Marija
came
home
*NL*
saying
that
she
had
met
a
girl
named
Jasaityte
who
had
a
friend
that
*NL*
worked
in
one
of
the
wrapping
rooms
in
Brown
's
,
and
might
get
a
place
*NL*
for
Ona
there
;
only
the
forelady
was
the
kind
that
takes
presents
--
it
*NL*
was
no
use
for
any
one
to
ask
her
for
a
place
unless
at
the
same
time
*NL*
they
slipped
a
ten-dollar
bill
into
her
hand
.
Jurgis
was
not
in
the
*NL*
least
surprised
at
this
now
--
he
merely
asked
what
the
wages
of
the
place
*NL*
would
be
.
So
negotiations
were
opened
,
and
after
an
interview
Ona
came
*NL*
home
and
reported
that
the
forelady
seemed
to
like
her
,
and
had
said
*NL*
that
,
while
she
was
not
sure
,
she
thought
she
might
be
able
to
put
her
*NL*
at
work
sewing
covers
on
hams
,
a
job
at
which
she
would
earn
as
much
as
*NL*
eight
or
ten
dollars
a
week
.
That
was
a
bid
,
so
Marija
reported
,
after
*NL*
consulting
her
friend
;
and
then
there
was
an
anxious
conference
at
home
.
*NL*
The
work
was
done
in
one
of
the
cellars
,
and
Jurgis
did
not
want
Ona
to
*NL*
work
in
such
a
place
;
but
then
it
was
easy
work
,
and
one
could
not
have
*NL*
everything
.
So
in
the
end
Ona
,
with
a
ten-dollar
bill
burning
a
hole
in
*NL*
her
palm
,
had
another
interview
with
the
forelady
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meantime
Teta
Elzbieta
had
taken
Stanislovas
to
the
priest
and
gotten
a
*NL*
certificate
to
the
effect
that
he
was
two
years
older
than
he
was
;
and
*NL*
with
it
the
little
boy
now
sallied
forth
to
make
his
fortune
in
the
*NL*
world
.
It
chanced
that
Durham
had
just
put
in
a
wonderful
new
lard
*NL*
machine
,
and
when
the
special
policeman
in
front
of
the
time
station
*NL*
saw
Stanislovas
and
his
document
,
he
smiled
to
himself
and
told
him
to
*NL*
go
--
``
Czia
!
Czia
!
''
pointing
.
And
so
Stanislovas
went
down
a
long
stone
*NL*
corridor
,
and
up
a
flight
of
stairs
,
which
took
him
into
a
room
lighted
*NL*
by
electricity
,
with
the
new
machines
for
filling
lard
cans
at
work
*NL*
in
it
.
The
lard
was
finished
on
the
floor
above
,
and
it
came
in
little
*NL*
jets
,
like
beautiful
,
wriggling
,
snow-white
snakes
of
unpleasant
odor
.
*NL*
There
were
several
kinds
and
sizes
of
jets
,
and
after
a
certain
precise
*NL*
quantity
had
come
out
,
each
stopped
automatically
,
and
the
wonderful
*NL*
machine
made
a
turn
,
and
took
the
can
under
another
jet
,
and
so
on
,
*NL*
until
it
was
filled
neatly
to
the
brim
,
and
pressed
tightly
,
and
*NL*
smoothed
off
.
To
attend
to
all
this
and
fill
several
hundred
cans
of
*NL*
lard
per
hour
,
there
were
necessary
two
human
creatures
,
one
of
whom
*NL*
knew
how
to
place
an
empty
lard
can
on
a
certain
spot
every
few
seconds
,
*NL*
and
the
other
of
whom
knew
how
to
take
a
full
lard
can
off
a
certain
*NL*
spot
every
few
seconds
and
set
it
upon
a
tray
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
,
after
little
Stanislovas
had
stood
gazing
timidly
about
him
for
*NL*
a
few
minutes
,
a
man
approached
him
,
and
asked
what
he
wanted
,
to
which
*NL*
Stanislovas
said
,
``
Job
.
''
Then
the
man
said
``
How
old
?
''
and
Stanislovas
*NL*
answered
,
``
Sixtin
.
''
Once
or
twice
every
year
a
state
inspector
would
*NL*
come
wandering
through
the
packing
plants
,
asking
a
child
here
and
there
*NL*
how
old
he
was
;
and
so
the
packers
were
very
careful
to
comply
with
the
*NL*
law
,
which
cost
them
as
much
trouble
as
was
now
involved
in
the
boss
's
*NL*
taking
the
document
from
the
little
boy
,
and
glancing
at
it
,
and
then
*NL*
sending
it
to
the
office
to
be
filed
away
.
Then
he
set
some
one
else
at
*NL*
a
different
job
,
and
showed
the
lad
how
to
place
a
lard
can
every
time
*NL*
the
empty
arm
of
the
remorseless
machine
came
to
him
;
and
so
was
decided
*NL*
the
place
in
the
universe
of
little
Stanislovas
,
and
his
destiny
till
*NL*
the
end
of
his
days
.
Hour
after
hour
,
day
after
day
,
year
after
year
,
it
*NL*
was
fated
that
he
should
stand
upon
a
certain
square
foot
of
floor
from
*NL*
seven
in
the
morning
until
noon
,
and
again
from
half-past
twelve
till
*NL*
half-past
five
,
making
never
a
motion
and
thinking
never
a
thought
,
*NL*
save
for
the
setting
of
lard
cans
.
In
summer
the
stench
of
the
warm
lard
*NL*
would
be
nauseating
,
and
in
winter
the
cans
would
all
but
freeze
to
his
*NL*
naked
little
fingers
in
the
unheated
cellar
.
Half
the
year
it
would
be
*NL*
dark
as
night
when
he
went
in
to
work
,
and
dark
as
night
again
when
*NL*
he
came
out
,
and
so
he
would
never
know
what
the
sun
looked
like
on
*NL*
weekdays
.
And
for
this
,
at
the
end
of
the
week
,
he
would
carry
home
*NL*
three
dollars
to
his
family
,
being
his
pay
at
the
rate
of
five
cents
per
*NL*
hour
--
just
about
his
proper
share
of
the
total
earnings
of
the
million
*NL*
and
three-quarters
of
children
who
are
now
engaged
in
earning
their
*NL*
livings
in
the
United
States
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
meantime
,
because
they
were
young
,
and
hope
is
not
to
be
stifled
*NL*
before
its
time
,
Jurgis
and
Ona
were
again
calculating
;
for
they
had
*NL*
discovered
that
the
wages
of
Stanislovas
would
a
little
more
than
pay
*NL*
the
interest
,
which
left
them
just
about
as
they
had
been
before
!
It
*NL*
would
be
but
fair
to
them
to
say
that
the
little
boy
was
delighted
with
*NL*
his
work
,
and
at
the
idea
of
earning
a
lot
of
money
;
and
also
that
the
*NL*
two
were
very
much
in
love
with
each
other
.

All
summer
long
the
family
toiled
,
and
in
the
fall
they
had
money
*NL*
enough
for
Jurgis
and
Ona
to
be
married
according
to
home
traditions
of
*NL*
decency
.
In
the
latter
part
of
November
they
hired
a
hall
,
and
invited
*NL*
all
their
new
acquaintances
,
who
came
and
left
them
over
a
hundred
*NL*
dollars
in
debt
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
bitter
and
cruel
experience
,
and
it
plunged
them
into
an
agony
*NL*
of
despair
.
Such
a
time
,
of
all
times
,
for
them
to
have
it
,
when
their
*NL*
hearts
were
made
tender
!
Such
a
pitiful
beginning
it
was
for
their
*NL*
married
life
;
they
loved
each
other
so
,
and
they
could
not
have
the
*NL*
briefest
respite
!
It
was
a
time
when
everything
cried
out
to
them
that
*NL*
they
ought
to
be
happy
;
when
wonder
burned
in
their
hearts
,
and
leaped
*NL*
into
flame
at
the
slightest
breath
.
They
were
shaken
to
the
depths
of
*NL*
them
,
with
the
awe
of
love
realized
--
and
was
it
so
very
weak
of
them
*NL*
that
they
cried
out
for
a
little
peace
?
They
had
opened
their
hearts
,
*NL*
like
flowers
to
the
springtime
,
and
the
merciless
winter
had
fallen
upon
*NL*
them
.
They
wondered
if
ever
any
love
that
had
blossomed
in
the
world
had
*NL*
been
so
crushed
and
trampled
!
*NL*
*NL*
Over
them
,
relentless
and
savage
,
there
cracked
the
lash
of
want
;
the
*NL*
morning
after
the
wedding
it
sought
them
as
they
slept
,
and
drove
*NL*
them
out
before
daybreak
to
work
.
Ona
was
scarcely
able
to
stand
with
*NL*
exhaustion
;
but
if
she
were
to
lose
her
place
they
would
be
ruined
,
and
*NL*
she
would
surely
lose
it
if
she
were
not
on
time
that
day
.
They
all
*NL*
had
to
go
,
even
little
Stanislovas
,
who
was
ill
from
overindulgence
in
*NL*
sausages
and
sarsaparilla
.
All
that
day
he
stood
at
his
lard
machine
,
*NL*
rocking
unsteadily
,
his
eyes
closing
in
spite
of
him
;
and
he
all
but
*NL*
lost
his
place
even
so
,
for
the
foreman
booted
him
twice
to
waken
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
fully
a
week
before
they
were
all
normal
again
,
and
meantime
,
*NL*
with
whining
children
and
cross
adults
,
the
house
was
not
a
pleasant
*NL*
place
to
live
in
.
Jurgis
lost
his
temper
very
little
,
however
,
all
*NL*
things
considered
.
It
was
because
of
Ona
;
the
least
glance
at
her
was
*NL*
always
enough
to
make
him
control
himself
.
She
was
so
sensitive
--
she
was
*NL*
not
fitted
for
such
a
life
as
this
;
and
a
hundred
times
a
day
,
when
he
*NL*
thought
of
her
,
he
would
clench
his
hands
and
fling
himself
again
at
the
*NL*
task
before
him
.
She
was
too
good
for
him
,
he
told
himself
,
and
he
was
*NL*
afraid
,
because
she
was
his
.
So
long
he
had
hungered
to
possess
her
,
*NL*
but
now
that
the
time
had
come
he
knew
that
he
had
not
earned
the
right
;
*NL*
that
she
trusted
him
so
was
all
her
own
simple
goodness
,
and
no
virtue
*NL*
of
his
.
But
he
was
resolved
that
she
should
never
find
this
out
,
and
so
*NL*
was
always
on
the
watch
to
see
that
he
did
not
betray
any
of
his
ugly
*NL*
self
;
he
would
take
care
even
in
little
matters
,
such
as
his
manners
,
*NL*
and
his
habit
of
swearing
when
things
went
wrong
.
The
tears
came
so
*NL*
easily
into
Ona
's
eyes
,
and
she
would
look
at
him
so
appealingly
--
it
*NL*
kept
Jurgis
quite
busy
making
resolutions
,
in
addition
to
all
the
other
*NL*
things
he
had
on
his
mind
.
It
was
true
that
more
things
were
going
on
at
*NL*
this
time
in
the
mind
of
Jurgis
than
ever
had
in
all
his
life
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
to
protect
her
,
to
do
battle
for
her
against
the
horror
he
saw
*NL*
about
them
.
He
was
all
that
she
had
to
look
to
,
and
if
he
failed
she
*NL*
would
be
lost
;
he
would
wrap
his
arms
about
her
,
and
try
to
hide
her
*NL*
from
the
world
.
He
had
learned
the
ways
of
things
about
him
now
.
It
was
*NL*
a
war
of
each
against
all
,
and
the
devil
take
the
hindmost
.
You
did
not
*NL*
give
feasts
to
other
people
,
you
waited
for
them
to
give
feasts
to
*NL*
you
.
You
went
about
with
your
soul
full
of
suspicion
and
hatred
;
you
*NL*
understood
that
you
were
environed
by
hostile
powers
that
were
trying
to
*NL*
get
your
money
,
and
who
used
all
the
virtues
to
bait
their
traps
with
.
*NL*
The
store-keepers
plastered
up
their
windows
with
all
sorts
of
lies
to
*NL*
entice
you
;
the
very
fences
by
the
wayside
,
the
lampposts
and
telegraph
*NL*
poles
,
were
pasted
over
with
lies
.
The
great
corporation
which
employed
*NL*
you
lied
to
you
,
and
lied
to
the
whole
country
--
from
top
to
bottom
it
*NL*
was
nothing
but
one
gigantic
lie
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
Jurgis
said
that
he
understood
it
;
and
yet
it
was
really
pitiful
,
for
*NL*
the
struggle
was
so
unfair
--
some
had
so
much
the
advantage
!
Here
he
was
,
*NL*
for
instance
,
vowing
upon
his
knees
that
he
would
save
Ona
from
harm
,
*NL*
and
only
a
week
later
she
was
suffering
atrociously
,
and
from
the
blow
*NL*
of
an
enemy
that
he
could
not
possibly
have
thwarted
.
There
came
a
day
*NL*
when
the
rain
fell
in
torrents
;
and
it
being
December
,
to
be
wet
with
it
*NL*
and
have
to
sit
all
day
long
in
one
of
the
cold
cellars
of
Brown
's
was
*NL*
no
laughing
matter
.
Ona
was
a
working
girl
,
and
did
not
own
waterproofs
*NL*
and
such
things
,
and
so
Jurgis
took
her
and
put
her
on
the
streetcar
.
*NL*
Now
it
chanced
that
this
car
line
was
owned
by
gentlemen
who
were
trying
*NL*
to
make
money
.
And
the
city
having
passed
an
ordinance
requiring
them
to
*NL*
give
transfers
,
they
had
fallen
into
a
rage
;
and
first
they
had
made
a
*NL*
rule
that
transfers
could
be
had
only
when
the
fare
was
paid
;
and
later
,
*NL*
growing
still
uglier
,
they
had
made
another
--
that
the
passenger
must
ask
*NL*
for
the
transfer
,
the
conductor
was
not
allowed
to
offer
it
.
Now
Ona
*NL*
had
been
told
that
she
was
to
get
a
transfer
;
but
it
was
not
her
way
to
*NL*
speak
up
,
and
so
she
merely
waited
,
following
the
conductor
about
with
*NL*
her
eyes
,
wondering
when
he
would
think
of
her
.
When
at
last
the
time
*NL*
came
for
her
to
get
out
,
she
asked
for
the
transfer
,
and
was
refused
.
*NL*
Not
knowing
what
to
make
of
this
,
she
began
to
argue
with
the
conductor
,
*NL*
in
a
language
of
which
he
did
not
understand
a
word
.
After
warning
her
*NL*
several
times
,
he
pulled
the
bell
and
the
car
went
on
--
at
which
Ona
*NL*
burst
into
tears
.
At
the
next
corner
she
got
out
,
of
course
;
and
as
she
*NL*
had
no
more
money
,
she
had
to
walk
the
rest
of
the
way
to
the
yards
in
*NL*
the
pouring
rain
.
And
so
all
day
long
she
sat
shivering
,
and
came
home
*NL*
at
night
with
her
teeth
chattering
and
pains
in
her
head
and
back
.
For
*NL*
two
weeks
afterward
she
suffered
cruelly
--
and
yet
every
day
she
had
to
*NL*
drag
herself
to
her
work
.
The
forewoman
was
especially
severe
with
Ona
,
*NL*
because
she
believed
that
she
was
obstinate
on
account
of
having
been
*NL*
refused
a
holiday
the
day
after
her
wedding
.
Ona
had
an
idea
that
her
*NL*
``
forelady
''
did
not
like
to
have
her
girls
marry
--
perhaps
because
she
was
*NL*
old
and
ugly
and
unmarried
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
many
such
dangers
,
in
which
the
odds
were
all
against
them
.
*NL*
Their
children
were
not
as
well
as
they
had
been
at
home
;
but
how
could
*NL*
they
know
that
there
was
no
sewer
to
their
house
,
and
that
the
drainage
*NL*
of
fifteen
years
was
in
a
cesspool
under
it
?
How
could
they
know
that
*NL*
the
pale-blue
milk
that
they
bought
around
the
corner
was
watered
,
and
*NL*
doctored
with
formaldehyde
besides
?
When
the
children
were
not
well
*NL*
at
home
,
Teta
Elzbieta
would
gather
herbs
and
cure
them
;
now
she
was
*NL*
obliged
to
go
to
the
drugstore
and
buy
extracts
--
and
how
was
she
to
know
*NL*
that
they
were
all
adulterated
?
How
could
they
find
out
that
their
tea
*NL*
and
coffee
,
their
sugar
and
flour
,
had
been
doctored
;
that
their
canned
*NL*
peas
had
been
colored
with
copper
salts
,
and
their
fruit
jams
with
*NL*
aniline
dyes
?
And
even
if
they
had
known
it
,
what
good
would
it
have
*NL*
done
them
,
since
there
was
no
place
within
miles
of
them
where
any
other
*NL*
sort
was
to
be
had
?
The
bitter
winter
was
coming
,
and
they
had
to
save
*NL*
money
to
get
more
clothing
and
bedding
;
but
it
would
not
matter
in
the
*NL*
least
how
much
they
saved
,
they
could
not
get
anything
to
keep
them
*NL*
warm
.
All
the
clothing
that
was
to
be
had
in
the
stores
was
made
of
*NL*
cotton
and
shoddy
,
which
is
made
by
tearing
old
clothes
to
pieces
and
*NL*
weaving
the
fiber
again
.
If
they
paid
higher
prices
,
they
might
get
*NL*
frills
and
fanciness
,
or
be
cheated
;
but
genuine
quality
they
could
not
*NL*
obtain
for
love
nor
money
.
A
young
friend
of
Szedvilas
'
,
recently
come
*NL*
from
abroad
,
had
become
a
clerk
in
a
store
on
Ashland
Avenue
,
and
he
*NL*
narrated
with
glee
a
trick
that
had
been
played
upon
an
unsuspecting
*NL*
countryman
by
his
boss
.
The
customer
had
desired
to
purchase
an
alarm
*NL*
clock
,
and
the
boss
had
shown
him
two
exactly
similar
,
telling
him
that
*NL*
the
price
of
one
was
a
dollar
and
of
the
other
a
dollar
seventy-five
.
*NL*
Upon
being
asked
what
the
difference
was
,
the
man
had
wound
up
the
first
*NL*
halfway
and
the
second
all
the
way
,
and
showed
the
customer
how
the
*NL*
latter
made
twice
as
much
noise
;
upon
which
the
customer
remarked
that
*NL*
he
was
a
sound
sleeper
,
and
had
better
take
the
more
expensive
clock
!
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
a
poet
who
sings
that
*NL*
*NL*
``
Deeper
their
heart
grows
and
nobler
their
bearing
,
*NL*
Whose
youth
in
the
fires
of
anguish
hath
died
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
not
likely
that
he
had
reference
to
the
kind
of
anguish
that
*NL*
comes
with
destitution
,
that
is
so
endlessly
bitter
and
cruel
,
and
*NL*
yet
so
sordid
and
petty
,
so
ugly
,
so
humiliating
--
unredeemed
by
the
*NL*
slightest
touch
of
dignity
or
even
of
pathos
.
It
is
a
kind
of
anguish
*NL*
that
poets
have
not
commonly
dealt
with
;
its
very
words
are
not
admitted
*NL*
into
the
vocabulary
of
poets
--
the
details
of
it
can
not
be
told
in
*NL*
polite
society
at
all
.
How
,
for
instance
,
could
any
one
expect
to
excite
*NL*
sympathy
among
lovers
of
good
literature
by
telling
how
a
family
found
*NL*
their
home
alive
with
vermin
,
and
of
all
the
suffering
and
inconvenience
*NL*
and
humiliation
they
were
put
to
,
and
the
hard-earned
money
they
spent
,
*NL*
in
efforts
to
get
rid
of
them
?
After
long
hesitation
and
uncertainty
*NL*
they
paid
twenty-five
cents
for
a
big
package
of
insect
powder
--
a
patent
*NL*
preparation
which
chanced
to
be
ninety-five
per
cent
gypsum
,
a
harmless
*NL*
earth
which
had
cost
about
two
cents
to
prepare
.
Of
course
it
had
not
*NL*
the
least
effect
,
except
upon
a
few
roaches
which
had
the
misfortune
to
*NL*
drink
water
after
eating
it
,
and
so
got
their
inwards
set
in
a
coating
*NL*
of
plaster
of
Paris
.
The
family
,
having
no
idea
of
this
,
and
no
more
*NL*
money
to
throw
away
,
had
nothing
to
do
but
give
up
and
submit
to
one
*NL*
more
misery
for
the
rest
of
their
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
there
was
old
Antanas
.
The
winter
came
,
and
the
place
where
he
*NL*
worked
was
a
dark
,
unheated
cellar
,
where
you
could
see
your
breath
all
*NL*
day
,
and
where
your
fingers
sometimes
tried
to
freeze
.
So
the
old
man
's
*NL*
cough
grew
every
day
worse
,
until
there
came
a
time
when
it
hardly
ever
*NL*
stopped
,
and
he
had
become
a
nuisance
about
the
place
.
Then
,
too
,
a
*NL*
still
more
dreadful
thing
happened
to
him
;
he
worked
in
a
place
where
*NL*
his
feet
were
soaked
in
chemicals
,
and
it
was
not
long
before
they
had
*NL*
eaten
through
his
new
boots
.
Then
sores
began
to
break
out
on
his
feet
,
*NL*
and
grow
worse
and
worse
.
Whether
it
was
that
his
blood
was
bad
,
or
*NL*
there
had
been
a
cut
,
he
could
not
say
;
but
he
asked
the
men
about
it
,
*NL*
and
learned
that
it
was
a
regular
thing
--
it
was
the
saltpeter
.
Every
one
*NL*
felt
it
,
sooner
or
later
,
and
then
it
was
all
up
with
him
,
at
least
for
*NL*
that
sort
of
work
.
The
sores
would
never
heal
--
in
the
end
his
toes
would
*NL*
drop
off
,
if
he
did
not
quit
.
Yet
old
Antanas
would
not
quit
;
he
saw
the
*NL*
suffering
of
his
family
,
and
he
remembered
what
it
had
cost
him
to
get
*NL*
a
job
.
So
he
tied
up
his
feet
,
and
went
on
limping
about
and
coughing
,
*NL*
until
at
last
he
fell
to
pieces
,
all
at
once
and
in
a
heap
,
like
the
*NL*
One-Horse
Shay
.
They
carried
him
to
a
dry
place
and
laid
him
on
the
*NL*
floor
,
and
that
night
two
of
the
men
helped
him
home
.
The
poor
old
man
*NL*
was
put
to
bed
,
and
though
he
tried
it
every
morning
until
the
end
,
he
*NL*
never
could
get
up
again
.
He
would
lie
there
and
cough
and
cough
,
day
*NL*
and
night
,
wasting
away
to
a
mere
skeleton
.
There
came
a
time
when
there
*NL*
was
so
little
flesh
on
him
that
the
bones
began
to
poke
through
--
which
*NL*
was
a
horrible
thing
to
see
or
even
to
think
of
.
And
one
night
he
had
*NL*
a
choking
fit
,
and
a
little
river
of
blood
came
out
of
his
mouth
.
The
*NL*
family
,
wild
with
terror
,
sent
for
a
doctor
,
and
paid
half
a
dollar
to
*NL*
be
told
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
.
Mercifully
the
doctor
did
not
*NL*
say
this
so
that
the
old
man
could
hear
,
for
he
was
still
clinging
to
*NL*
the
faith
that
tomorrow
or
next
day
he
would
be
better
,
and
could
go
*NL*
back
to
his
job
.
The
company
had
sent
word
to
him
that
they
would
keep
*NL*
it
for
him
--
or
rather
Jurgis
had
bribed
one
of
the
men
to
come
one
*NL*
Sunday
afternoon
and
say
they
had
.
Dede
Antanas
continued
to
believe
*NL*
it
,
while
three
more
hemorrhages
came
;
and
then
at
last
one
morning
they
*NL*
found
him
stiff
and
cold
.
Things
were
not
going
well
with
them
then
,
*NL*
and
though
it
nearly
broke
Teta
Elzbieta
's
heart
,
they
were
forced
to
*NL*
dispense
with
nearly
all
the
decencies
of
a
funeral
;
they
had
only
a
*NL*
hearse
,
and
one
hack
for
the
women
and
children
;
and
Jurgis
,
who
was
*NL*
learning
things
fast
,
spent
all
Sunday
making
a
bargain
for
these
,
and
*NL*
he
made
it
in
the
presence
of
witnesses
,
so
that
when
the
man
tried
to
*NL*
charge
him
for
all
sorts
of
incidentals
,
he
did
not
have
to
pay
.
For
*NL*
twenty-five
years
old
Antanas
Rudkus
and
his
son
had
dwelt
in
the
forest
*NL*
together
,
and
it
was
hard
to
part
in
this
way
;
perhaps
it
was
just
as
*NL*
well
that
Jurgis
had
to
give
all
his
attention
to
the
task
of
having
*NL*
a
funeral
without
being
bankrupted
,
and
so
had
no
time
to
indulge
in
*NL*
memories
and
grief
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Now
the
dreadful
winter
was
come
upon
them
.
In
the
forests
,
all
summer
*NL*
long
,
the
branches
of
the
trees
do
battle
for
light
,
and
some
of
them
*NL*
lose
and
die
;
and
then
come
the
raging
blasts
,
and
the
storms
of
snow
*NL*
and
hail
,
and
strew
the
ground
with
these
weaker
branches
.
Just
so
it
*NL*
was
in
Packingtown
;
the
whole
district
braced
itself
for
the
struggle
*NL*
that
was
an
agony
,
and
those
whose
time
was
come
died
off
in
hordes
.
*NL*
All
the
year
round
they
had
been
serving
as
cogs
in
the
great
packing
*NL*
machine
;
and
now
was
the
time
for
the
renovating
of
it
,
and
the
*NL*
replacing
of
damaged
parts
.
There
came
pneumonia
and
grippe
,
stalking
*NL*
among
them
,
seeking
for
weakened
constitutions
;
there
was
the
annual
*NL*
harvest
of
those
whom
tuberculosis
had
been
dragging
down
.
There
came
*NL*
cruel
,
cold
,
and
biting
winds
,
and
blizzards
of
snow
,
all
testing
*NL*
relentlessly
for
failing
muscles
and
impoverished
blood
.
Sooner
or
later
*NL*
came
the
day
when
the
unfit
one
did
not
report
for
work
;
and
then
,
with
*NL*
no
time
lost
in
waiting
,
and
no
inquiries
or
regrets
,
there
was
a
chance
*NL*
for
a
new
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
new
hands
were
here
by
the
thousands
.
All
day
long
the
gates
of
the
*NL*
packing
houses
were
besieged
by
starving
and
penniless
men
;
they
came
,
*NL*
literally
,
by
the
thousands
every
single
morning
,
fighting
with
each
*NL*
other
for
a
chance
for
life
.
Blizzards
and
cold
made
no
difference
to
*NL*
them
,
they
were
always
on
hand
;
they
were
on
hand
two
hours
before
the
*NL*
sun
rose
,
an
hour
before
the
work
began
.
Sometimes
their
faces
*NL*
froze
,
sometimes
their
feet
and
their
hands
;
sometimes
they
froze
all
*NL*
together
--
but
still
they
came
,
for
they
had
no
other
place
to
go
.
One
*NL*
day
Durham
advertised
in
the
paper
for
two
hundred
men
to
cut
ice
;
and
*NL*
all
that
day
the
homeless
and
starving
of
the
city
came
trudging
through
*NL*
the
snow
from
all
over
its
two
hundred
square
miles
.
That
night
*NL*
forty
score
of
them
crowded
into
the
station
house
of
the
stockyards
*NL*
district
--
they
filled
the
rooms
,
sleeping
in
each
other
's
laps
,
toboggan
*NL*
fashion
,
and
they
piled
on
top
of
each
other
in
the
corridors
,
till
the
*NL*
police
shut
the
doors
and
left
some
to
freeze
outside
.
On
the
morrow
,
*NL*
before
daybreak
,
there
were
three
thousand
at
Durham
's
,
and
the
police
*NL*
reserves
had
to
be
sent
for
to
quell
the
riot
.
Then
Durham
's
bosses
*NL*
picked
out
twenty
of
the
biggest
;
the
``
two
hundred
''
proved
to
have
been
*NL*
a
printer
's
error
.
*NL*
*NL*
Four
or
five
miles
to
the
eastward
lay
the
lake
,
and
over
this
the
*NL*
bitter
winds
came
raging
.
Sometimes
the
thermometer
would
fall
to
ten
or
*NL*
twenty
degrees
below
zero
at
night
,
and
in
the
morning
the
streets
would
*NL*
be
piled
with
snowdrifts
up
to
the
first-floor
windows
.
The
streets
*NL*
through
which
our
friends
had
to
go
to
their
work
were
all
unpaved
and
*NL*
full
of
deep
holes
and
gullies
;
in
summer
,
when
it
rained
hard
,
a
man
*NL*
might
have
to
wade
to
his
waist
to
get
to
his
house
;
and
now
in
winter
*NL*
it
was
no
joke
getting
through
these
places
,
before
light
in
the
morning
*NL*
and
after
dark
at
night
.
They
would
wrap
up
in
all
they
owned
,
but
they
*NL*
could
not
wrap
up
against
exhaustion
;
and
many
a
man
gave
out
in
these
*NL*
battles
with
the
snowdrifts
,
and
lay
down
and
fell
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
if
it
was
bad
for
the
men
,
one
may
imagine
how
the
women
and
*NL*
children
fared
.
Some
would
ride
in
the
cars
,
if
the
cars
were
running
;
*NL*
but
when
you
are
making
only
five
cents
an
hour
,
as
was
little
*NL*
Stanislovas
,
you
do
not
like
to
spend
that
much
to
ride
two
miles
.
The
*NL*
children
would
come
to
the
yards
with
great
shawls
about
their
ears
,
*NL*
and
so
tied
up
that
you
could
hardly
find
them
--
and
still
there
would
be
*NL*
accidents
.
One
bitter
morning
in
February
the
little
boy
who
worked
at
*NL*
the
lard
machine
with
Stanislovas
came
about
an
hour
late
,
and
screaming
*NL*
with
pain
.
They
unwrapped
him
,
and
a
man
began
vigorously
rubbing
his
*NL*
ears
;
and
as
they
were
frozen
stiff
,
it
took
only
two
or
three
rubs
to
*NL*
break
them
short
off
.
As
a
result
of
this
,
little
Stanislovas
conceived
*NL*
a
terror
of
the
cold
that
was
almost
a
mania
.
Every
morning
,
when
it
*NL*
came
time
to
start
for
the
yards
,
he
would
begin
to
cry
and
protest
.
*NL*
Nobody
knew
quite
how
to
manage
him
,
for
threats
did
no
good
--
it
seemed
*NL*
to
be
something
that
he
could
not
control
,
and
they
feared
sometimes
*NL*
that
he
would
go
into
convulsions
.
In
the
end
it
had
to
be
arranged
that
*NL*
he
always
went
with
Jurgis
,
and
came
home
with
him
again
;
and
often
,
*NL*
when
the
snow
was
deep
,
the
man
would
carry
him
the
whole
way
on
his
*NL*
shoulders
.
Sometimes
Jurgis
would
be
working
until
late
at
night
,
and
*NL*
then
it
was
pitiful
,
for
there
was
no
place
for
the
little
fellow
to
*NL*
wait
,
save
in
the
doorways
or
in
a
corner
of
the
killing
beds
,
and
he
*NL*
would
all
but
fall
asleep
there
,
and
freeze
to
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
heat
upon
the
killing
beds
;
the
men
might
exactly
as
well
*NL*
have
worked
out
of
doors
all
winter
.
For
that
matter
,
there
was
very
*NL*
little
heat
anywhere
in
the
building
,
except
in
the
cooking
rooms
and
*NL*
such
places
--
and
it
was
the
men
who
worked
in
these
who
ran
the
most
*NL*
risk
of
all
,
because
whenever
they
had
to
pass
to
another
room
they
had
*NL*
to
go
through
ice-cold
corridors
,
and
sometimes
with
nothing
on
above
*NL*
the
waist
except
a
sleeveless
undershirt
.
On
the
killing
beds
you
were
*NL*
apt
to
be
covered
with
blood
,
and
it
would
freeze
solid
;
if
you
leaned
*NL*
against
a
pillar
,
you
would
freeze
to
that
,
and
if
you
put
your
hand
*NL*
upon
the
blade
of
your
knife
,
you
would
run
a
chance
of
leaving
your
*NL*
skin
on
it
.
The
men
would
tie
up
their
feet
in
newspapers
and
old
sacks
,
*NL*
and
these
would
be
soaked
in
blood
and
frozen
,
and
then
soaked
again
,
*NL*
and
so
on
,
until
by
nighttime
a
man
would
be
walking
on
great
lumps
the
*NL*
size
of
the
feet
of
an
elephant
.
Now
and
then
,
when
the
bosses
were
*NL*
not
looking
,
you
would
see
them
plunging
their
feet
and
ankles
into
the
*NL*
steaming
hot
carcass
of
the
steer
,
or
darting
across
the
room
to
*NL*
the
hot-water
jets
.
The
cruelest
thing
of
all
was
that
nearly
all
of
*NL*
them
--
all
of
those
who
used
knives
--
were
unable
to
wear
gloves
,
and
*NL*
their
arms
would
be
white
with
frost
and
their
hands
would
grow
numb
,
*NL*
and
then
of
course
there
would
be
accidents
.
Also
the
air
would
be
full
*NL*
of
steam
,
from
the
hot
water
and
the
hot
blood
,
so
that
you
could
not
*NL*
see
five
feet
before
you
;
and
then
,
with
men
rushing
about
at
the
speed
*NL*
they
kept
up
on
the
killing
beds
,
and
all
with
butcher
knives
,
like
*NL*
razors
,
in
their
hands
--
well
,
it
was
to
be
counted
as
a
wonder
that
*NL*
there
were
not
more
men
slaughtered
than
cattle
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
all
this
inconvenience
they
might
have
put
up
with
,
if
only
it
*NL*
had
not
been
for
one
thing
--
if
only
there
had
been
some
place
where
they
*NL*
might
eat
.
Jurgis
had
either
to
eat
his
dinner
amid
the
stench
in
which
*NL*
he
had
worked
,
or
else
to
rush
,
as
did
all
his
companions
,
to
any
one
of
*NL*
the
hundreds
of
liquor
stores
which
stretched
out
their
arms
to
him
.
To
*NL*
the
west
of
the
yards
ran
Ashland
Avenue
,
and
here
was
an
unbroken
*NL*
line
of
saloons
--
``
Whiskey
Row
,
''
they
called
it
;
to
the
north
was
*NL*
Forty-seventh
Street
,
where
there
were
half
a
dozen
to
the
block
,
and
at
*NL*
the
angle
of
the
two
was
``
Whiskey
Point
,
''
a
space
of
fifteen
or
twenty
*NL*
acres
,
and
containing
one
glue
factory
and
about
two
hundred
saloons
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
might
walk
among
these
and
take
his
choice
:
``
Hot
pea-soup
and
boiled
*NL*
cabbage
today
.
''
``
Sauerkraut
and
hot
frankfurters
.
Walk
in
.
''
``
Bean
soup
*NL*
and
stewed
lamb
.
Welcome
.
''
All
of
these
things
were
printed
in
many
*NL*
languages
,
as
were
also
the
names
of
the
resorts
,
which
were
infinite
*NL*
in
their
variety
and
appeal
.
There
was
the
``
Home
Circle
''
and
the
*NL*
``
Cosey
Corner
''
;
there
were
``
Firesides
''
and
``
Hearthstones
''
and
``
Pleasure
*NL*
Palaces
''
and
``
Wonderlands
''
and
``
Dream
Castles
''
and
``
Love
's
Delights
.
''
*NL*
Whatever
else
they
were
called
,
they
were
sure
to
be
called
``
Union
*NL*
Headquarters
,
''
and
to
hold
out
a
welcome
to
workingmen
;
and
there
was
*NL*
always
a
warm
stove
,
and
a
chair
near
it
,
and
some
friends
to
laugh
and
*NL*
talk
with
.
There
was
only
one
condition
attached
,
--
you
must
drink
.
If
*NL*
you
went
in
not
intending
to
drink
,
you
would
be
put
out
in
no
time
,
and
*NL*
if
you
were
slow
about
going
,
like
as
not
you
would
get
your
head
split
*NL*
open
with
a
beer
bottle
in
the
bargain
.
But
all
of
the
men
understood
*NL*
the
convention
and
drank
;
they
believed
that
by
it
they
were
getting
*NL*
something
for
nothing
--
for
they
did
not
need
to
take
more
than
one
*NL*
drink
,
and
upon
the
strength
of
it
they
might
fill
themselves
up
with
a
*NL*
good
hot
dinner
.
This
did
not
always
work
out
in
practice
,
however
,
for
*NL*
there
was
pretty
sure
to
be
a
friend
who
would
treat
you
,
and
then
you
*NL*
would
have
to
treat
him
.
Then
some
one
else
would
come
in
--
and
,
anyhow
,
*NL*
a
few
drinks
were
good
for
a
man
who
worked
hard
.
As
he
went
back
he
did
*NL*
not
shiver
so
,
he
had
more
courage
for
his
task
;
the
deadly
brutalizing
*NL*
monotony
of
it
did
not
afflict
him
so
,
--
he
had
ideas
while
he
worked
,
*NL*
and
took
a
more
cheerful
view
of
his
circumstances
.
On
the
way
home
,
*NL*
however
,
the
shivering
was
apt
to
come
on
him
again
;
and
so
he
would
*NL*
have
to
stop
once
or
twice
to
warm
up
against
the
cruel
cold
.
As
there
*NL*
were
hot
things
to
eat
in
this
saloon
too
,
he
might
get
home
late
to
his
*NL*
supper
,
or
he
might
not
get
home
at
all
.
And
then
his
wife
might
set
out
*NL*
to
look
for
him
,
and
she
too
would
feel
the
cold
;
and
perhaps
she
would
*NL*
have
some
of
the
children
with
her
--
and
so
a
whole
family
would
drift
*NL*
into
drinking
,
as
the
current
of
a
river
drifts
downstream
.
As
if
to
*NL*
complete
the
chain
,
the
packers
all
paid
their
men
in
checks
,
refusing
*NL*
all
requests
to
pay
in
coin
;
and
where
in
Packingtown
could
a
man
go
to
*NL*
have
his
check
cashed
but
to
a
saloon
,
where
he
could
pay
for
the
favor
*NL*
by
spending
a
part
of
the
money
?
*NL*
*NL*
From
all
of
these
things
Jurgis
was
saved
because
of
Ona
.
He
never
would
*NL*
take
but
the
one
drink
at
noontime
;
and
so
he
got
the
reputation
of
*NL*
being
a
surly
fellow
,
and
was
not
quite
welcome
at
the
saloons
,
and
had
*NL*
to
drift
about
from
one
to
another
.
Then
at
night
he
would
go
straight
*NL*
home
,
helping
Ona
and
Stanislovas
,
or
often
putting
the
former
on
a
car
.
*NL*
And
when
he
got
home
perhaps
he
would
have
to
trudge
several
blocks
,
and
*NL*
come
staggering
back
through
the
snowdrifts
with
a
bag
of
coal
upon
*NL*
his
shoulder
.
Home
was
not
a
very
attractive
place
--
at
least
not
this
*NL*
winter
.
They
had
only
been
able
to
buy
one
stove
,
and
this
was
a
small
*NL*
one
,
and
proved
not
big
enough
to
warm
even
the
kitchen
in
the
bitterest
*NL*
weather
.
This
made
it
hard
for
Teta
Elzbieta
all
day
,
and
for
the
*NL*
children
when
they
could
not
get
to
school
.
At
night
they
would
sit
*NL*
huddled
round
this
stove
,
while
they
ate
their
supper
off
their
laps
;
*NL*
and
then
Jurgis
and
Jonas
would
smoke
a
pipe
,
after
which
they
would
all
*NL*
crawl
into
their
beds
to
get
warm
,
after
putting
out
the
fire
to
save
*NL*
the
coal
.
Then
they
would
have
some
frightful
experiences
with
the
cold
.
*NL*
They
would
sleep
with
all
their
clothes
on
,
including
their
overcoats
,
*NL*
and
put
over
them
all
the
bedding
and
spare
clothing
they
owned
;
the
*NL*
children
would
sleep
all
crowded
into
one
bed
,
and
yet
even
so
they
*NL*
could
not
keep
warm
.
The
outside
ones
would
be
shivering
and
sobbing
,
*NL*
crawling
over
the
others
and
trying
to
get
down
into
the
center
,
and
*NL*
causing
a
fight
.
This
old
house
with
the
leaky
weatherboards
was
a
*NL*
very
different
thing
from
their
cabins
at
home
,
with
great
thick
walls
*NL*
plastered
inside
and
outside
with
mud
;
and
the
cold
which
came
upon
them
*NL*
was
a
living
thing
,
a
demon-presence
in
the
room
.
They
would
waken
in
*NL*
the
midnight
hours
,
when
everything
was
black
;
perhaps
they
would
hear
*NL*
it
yelling
outside
,
or
perhaps
there
would
be
deathlike
stillness
--
and
*NL*
that
would
be
worse
yet
.
They
could
feel
the
cold
as
it
crept
in
through
*NL*
the
cracks
,
reaching
out
for
them
with
its
icy
,
death-dealing
fingers
;
*NL*
and
they
would
crouch
and
cower
,
and
try
to
hide
from
it
,
all
in
vain
.
*NL*
It
would
come
,
and
it
would
come
;
a
grisly
thing
,
a
specter
born
in
*NL*
the
black
caverns
of
terror
;
a
power
primeval
,
cosmic
,
shadowing
the
*NL*
tortures
of
the
lost
souls
flung
out
to
chaos
and
destruction
.
It
was
*NL*
cruel
iron-hard
;
and
hour
after
hour
they
would
cringe
in
its
grasp
,
*NL*
alone
,
alone
.
There
would
be
no
one
to
hear
them
if
they
cried
out
;
*NL*
there
would
be
no
help
,
no
mercy
.
And
so
on
until
morning
--
when
they
*NL*
would
go
out
to
another
day
of
toil
,
a
little
weaker
,
a
little
nearer
to
*NL*
the
time
when
it
would
be
their
turn
to
be
shaken
from
the
tree
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
even
by
this
deadly
winter
the
germ
of
hope
was
not
to
be
kept
*NL*
from
sprouting
in
their
hearts
.
It
was
just
at
this
time
that
the
great
*NL*
adventure
befell
Marija
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
victim
was
Tamoszius
Kuszleika
,
who
played
the
violin
.
Everybody
*NL*
laughed
at
them
,
for
Tamoszius
was
petite
and
frail
,
and
Marija
could
*NL*
have
picked
him
up
and
carried
him
off
under
one
arm
.
But
perhaps
that
*NL*
was
why
she
fascinated
him
;
the
sheer
volume
of
Marija
's
energy
was
*NL*
overwhelming
.
That
first
night
at
the
wedding
Tamoszius
had
hardly
taken
*NL*
his
eyes
off
her
;
and
later
on
,
when
he
came
to
find
that
she
had
really
*NL*
the
heart
of
a
baby
,
her
voice
and
her
violence
ceased
to
terrify
him
,
*NL*
and
he
got
the
habit
of
coming
to
pay
her
visits
on
Sunday
afternoons
.
*NL*
There
was
no
place
to
entertain
company
except
in
the
kitchen
,
in
the
*NL*
midst
of
the
family
,
and
Tamoszius
would
sit
there
with
his
hat
between
*NL*
his
knees
,
never
saying
more
than
half
a
dozen
words
at
a
time
,
and
*NL*
turning
red
in
the
face
before
he
managed
to
say
those
;
until
finally
*NL*
Jurgis
would
clap
him
upon
the
back
,
in
his
hearty
way
,
crying
,
``
Come
*NL*
now
,
brother
,
give
us
a
tune
.
''
And
then
Tamoszius
'
face
would
light
up
*NL*
and
he
would
get
out
his
fiddle
,
tuck
it
under
his
chin
,
and
play
.
And
*NL*
forthwith
the
soul
of
him
would
flame
up
and
become
eloquent
--
it
was
*NL*
almost
an
impropriety
,
for
all
the
while
his
gaze
would
be
fixed
upon
*NL*
Marija
's
face
,
until
she
would
begin
to
turn
red
and
lower
her
eyes
.
*NL*
There
was
no
resisting
the
music
of
Tamoszius
,
however
;
even
the
*NL*
children
would
sit
awed
and
wondering
,
and
the
tears
would
run
down
Teta
*NL*
Elzbieta
's
cheeks
.
A
wonderful
privilege
it
was
to
be
thus
admitted
into
*NL*
the
soul
of
a
man
of
genius
,
to
be
allowed
to
share
the
ecstasies
and
*NL*
the
agonies
of
his
inmost
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
there
were
other
benefits
accruing
to
Marija
from
this
*NL*
friendship
--
benefits
of
a
more
substantial
nature
.
People
paid
Tamoszius
*NL*
big
money
to
come
and
make
music
on
state
occasions
;
and
also
they
*NL*
would
invite
him
to
parties
and
festivals
,
knowing
well
that
he
was
too
*NL*
good-natured
to
come
without
his
fiddle
,
and
that
having
brought
it
,
*NL*
he
could
be
made
to
play
while
others
danced
.
Once
he
made
bold
to
ask
*NL*
Marija
to
accompany
him
to
such
a
party
,
and
Marija
accepted
,
to
his
*NL*
great
delight
--
after
which
he
never
went
anywhere
without
her
,
while
if
*NL*
the
celebration
were
given
by
friends
of
his
,
he
would
invite
the
rest
*NL*
of
the
family
also
.
In
any
case
Marija
would
bring
back
a
huge
pocketful
*NL*
of
cakes
and
sandwiches
for
the
children
,
and
stories
of
all
the
good
*NL*
things
she
herself
had
managed
to
consume
.
She
was
compelled
,
at
these
*NL*
parties
,
to
spend
most
of
her
time
at
the
refreshment
table
,
for
she
*NL*
could
not
dance
with
anybody
except
other
women
and
very
old
men
;
*NL*
Tamoszius
was
of
an
excitable
temperament
,
and
afflicted
with
a
frantic
*NL*
jealousy
,
and
any
unmarried
man
who
ventured
to
put
his
arm
about
the
*NL*
ample
waist
of
Marija
would
be
certain
to
throw
the
orchestra
out
of
*NL*
tune
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
great
help
to
a
person
who
had
to
toil
all
the
week
to
be
able
*NL*
to
look
forward
to
some
such
relaxation
as
this
on
Saturday
nights
.
The
*NL*
family
was
too
poor
and
too
hardworked
to
make
many
acquaintances
;
*NL*
in
Packingtown
,
as
a
rule
,
people
know
only
their
near
neighbors
and
*NL*
shopmates
,
and
so
the
place
is
like
a
myriad
of
little
country
villages
.
*NL*
But
now
there
was
a
member
of
the
family
who
was
permitted
to
travel
and
*NL*
widen
her
horizon
;
and
so
each
week
there
would
be
new
personalities
to
*NL*
talk
about
,
--
how
so-and-so
was
dressed
,
and
where
she
worked
,
and
what
*NL*
she
got
,
and
whom
she
was
in
love
with
;
and
how
this
man
had
jilted
his
*NL*
girl
,
and
how
she
had
quarreled
with
the
other
girl
,
and
what
had
passed
*NL*
between
them
;
and
how
another
man
beat
his
wife
,
and
spent
all
her
*NL*
earnings
upon
drink
,
and
pawned
her
very
clothes
.
Some
people
would
have
*NL*
scorned
this
talk
as
gossip
;
but
then
one
has
to
talk
about
what
one
*NL*
knows
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
one
Saturday
night
,
as
they
were
coming
home
from
a
wedding
,
that
*NL*
Tamoszius
found
courage
,
and
set
down
his
violin
case
in
the
street
and
*NL*
spoke
his
heart
;
and
then
Marija
clasped
him
in
her
arms
.
She
told
them
*NL*
all
about
it
the
next
day
,
and
fairly
cried
with
happiness
,
for
she
said
*NL*
that
Tamoszius
was
a
lovely
man
.
After
that
he
no
longer
made
love
*NL*
to
her
with
his
fiddle
,
but
they
would
sit
for
hours
in
the
kitchen
,
*NL*
blissfully
happy
in
each
other
's
arms
;
it
was
the
tacit
convention
of
*NL*
the
family
to
know
nothing
of
what
was
going
on
in
that
corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
planning
to
be
married
in
the
spring
,
and
have
the
garret
*NL*
of
the
house
fixed
up
,
and
live
there
.
Tamoszius
made
good
wages
;
and
*NL*
little
by
little
the
family
were
paying
back
their
debt
to
Marija
,
*NL*
so
she
ought
soon
to
have
enough
to
start
life
upon
--
only
,
with
her
*NL*
preposterous
softheartedness
,
she
would
insist
upon
spending
a
good
part
*NL*
of
her
money
every
week
for
things
which
she
saw
they
needed
.
Marija
*NL*
was
really
the
capitalist
of
the
party
,
for
she
had
become
an
expert
can
*NL*
painter
by
this
time
--
she
was
getting
fourteen
cents
for
every
hundred
*NL*
and
ten
cans
,
and
she
could
paint
more
than
two
cans
every
minute
.
*NL*
Marija
felt
,
so
to
speak
,
that
she
had
her
hand
on
the
throttle
,
and
the
*NL*
neighborhood
was
vocal
with
her
rejoicings
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
her
friends
would
shake
their
heads
and
tell
her
to
go
slow
;
one
*NL*
could
not
count
upon
such
good
fortune
forever
--
there
were
accidents
*NL*
that
always
happened
.
But
Marija
was
not
to
be
prevailed
upon
,
and
went
*NL*
on
planning
and
dreaming
of
all
the
treasures
she
was
going
to
have
for
*NL*
her
home
;
and
so
,
when
the
crash
did
come
,
her
grief
was
painful
to
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
her
canning
factory
shut
down
!
Marija
would
about
as
soon
have
*NL*
expected
to
see
the
sun
shut
down
--
the
huge
establishment
had
been
to
*NL*
her
a
thing
akin
to
the
planets
and
the
seasons
.
But
now
it
was
shut
!
*NL*
And
they
had
not
given
her
any
explanation
,
they
had
not
even
given
her
*NL*
a
day
's
warning
;
they
had
simply
posted
a
notice
one
Saturday
that
all
*NL*
hands
would
be
paid
off
that
afternoon
,
and
would
not
resume
work
for
at
*NL*
least
a
month
!
And
that
was
all
that
there
was
to
it
--
her
job
was
gone
!
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
holiday
rush
that
was
over
,
the
girls
said
in
answer
to
*NL*
Marija
's
inquiries
;
after
that
there
was
always
a
slack
.
Sometimes
the
*NL*
factory
would
start
up
on
half
time
after
a
while
,
but
there
was
no
*NL*
telling
--
it
had
been
known
to
stay
closed
until
way
into
the
summer
.
The
*NL*
prospects
were
bad
at
present
,
for
truckmen
who
worked
in
the
storerooms
*NL*
said
that
these
were
piled
up
to
the
ceilings
,
so
that
the
firm
could
*NL*
not
have
found
room
for
another
week
's
output
of
cans
.
And
they
had
*NL*
turned
off
three-quarters
of
these
men
,
which
was
a
still
worse
sign
,
*NL*
since
it
meant
that
there
were
no
orders
to
be
filled
.
It
was
all
a
*NL*
swindle
,
can-painting
,
said
the
girls
--
you
were
crazy
with
delight
*NL*
because
you
were
making
twelve
or
fourteen
dollars
a
week
,
and
saving
*NL*
half
of
it
;
but
you
had
to
spend
it
all
keeping
alive
while
you
were
*NL*
out
,
and
so
your
pay
was
really
only
half
what
you
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Marija
came
home
,
and
because
she
was
a
person
who
could
not
rest
*NL*
without
danger
of
explosion
,
they
first
had
a
great
house
cleaning
,
and
*NL*
then
she
set
out
to
search
Packingtown
for
a
job
to
fill
up
the
gap
.
As
*NL*
nearly
all
the
canning
establishments
were
shut
down
,
and
all
the
girls
*NL*
hunting
work
,
it
will
be
readily
understood
that
Marija
did
not
find
*NL*
any
.
Then
she
took
to
trying
the
stores
and
saloons
,
and
when
this
*NL*
failed
she
even
traveled
over
into
the
far-distant
regions
near
the
lake
*NL*
front
,
where
lived
the
rich
people
in
great
palaces
,
and
begged
there
*NL*
for
some
sort
of
work
that
could
be
done
by
a
person
who
did
not
know
*NL*
English
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
men
upon
the
killing
beds
felt
also
the
effects
of
the
slump
which
*NL*
had
turned
Marija
out
;
but
they
felt
it
in
a
different
way
,
and
a
way
*NL*
which
made
Jurgis
understand
at
last
all
their
bitterness
.
The
big
*NL*
packers
did
not
turn
their
hands
off
and
close
down
,
like
the
canning
*NL*
factories
;
but
they
began
to
run
for
shorter
and
shorter
hours
.
They
had
*NL*
always
required
the
men
to
be
on
the
killing
beds
and
ready
for
work
at
*NL*
seven
o'clock
,
although
there
was
almost
never
any
work
to
be
done
till
*NL*
the
buyers
out
in
the
yards
had
gotten
to
work
,
and
some
cattle
had
come
*NL*
over
the
chutes
.
That
would
often
be
ten
or
eleven
o'clock
,
which
was
*NL*
bad
enough
,
in
all
conscience
;
but
now
,
in
the
slack
season
,
they
would
*NL*
perhaps
not
have
a
thing
for
their
men
to
do
till
late
in
the
afternoon
.
*NL*
And
so
they
would
have
to
loaf
around
,
in
a
place
where
the
thermometer
*NL*
might
be
twenty
degrees
below
zero
!
At
first
one
would
see
them
running
*NL*
about
,
or
skylarking
with
each
other
,
trying
to
keep
warm
;
but
before
*NL*
the
day
was
over
they
would
become
quite
chilled
through
and
exhausted
,
*NL*
and
,
when
the
cattle
finally
came
,
so
near
frozen
that
to
move
was
an
*NL*
agony
.
And
then
suddenly
the
place
would
spring
into
activity
,
and
the
*NL*
merciless
``
speeding-up
''
would
begin
!
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
weeks
at
a
time
when
Jurgis
went
home
after
such
a
day
as
*NL*
this
with
not
more
than
two
hours
'
work
to
his
credit
--
which
meant
about
*NL*
thirty-five
cents
.
There
were
many
days
when
the
total
was
less
than
*NL*
half
an
hour
,
and
others
when
there
was
none
at
all
.
The
general
average
*NL*
was
six
hours
a
day
,
which
meant
for
Jurgis
about
six
dollars
a
week
;
*NL*
and
this
six
hours
of
work
would
be
done
after
standing
on
the
killing
*NL*
bed
till
one
o'clock
,
or
perhaps
even
three
or
four
o'clock
,
in
the
*NL*
afternoon
.
Like
as
not
there
would
come
a
rush
of
cattle
at
the
very
*NL*
end
of
the
day
,
which
the
men
would
have
to
dispose
of
before
they
went
*NL*
home
,
often
working
by
electric
light
till
nine
or
ten
,
or
even
twelve
*NL*
or
one
o'clock
,
and
without
a
single
instant
for
a
bite
of
supper
.
The
*NL*
men
were
at
the
mercy
of
the
cattle
.
Perhaps
the
buyers
would
be
holding
*NL*
off
for
better
prices
--
if
they
could
scare
the
shippers
into
thinking
*NL*
that
they
meant
to
buy
nothing
that
day
,
they
could
get
their
own
terms
.
*NL*
For
some
reason
the
cost
of
fodder
for
cattle
in
the
yards
was
much
*NL*
above
the
market
price
--
and
you
were
not
allowed
to
bring
your
own
*NL*
fodder
!
Then
,
too
,
a
number
of
cars
were
apt
to
arrive
late
in
the
day
,
*NL*
now
that
the
roads
were
blocked
with
snow
,
and
the
packers
would
buy
*NL*
their
cattle
that
night
,
to
get
them
cheaper
,
and
then
would
come
into
*NL*
play
their
ironclad
rule
,
that
all
cattle
must
be
killed
the
same
day
*NL*
they
were
bought
.
There
was
no
use
kicking
about
this
--
there
had
been
*NL*
one
delegation
after
another
to
see
the
packers
about
it
,
only
to
be
*NL*
told
that
it
was
the
rule
,
and
that
there
was
not
the
slightest
chance
*NL*
of
its
ever
being
altered
.
And
so
on
Christmas
Eve
Jurgis
worked
till
*NL*
nearly
one
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
and
on
Christmas
Day
he
was
on
the
*NL*
killing
bed
at
seven
o'clock
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
was
bad
;
and
yet
it
was
not
the
worst
.
For
after
all
the
hard
*NL*
work
a
man
did
,
he
was
paid
for
only
part
of
it
.
Jurgis
had
once
been
*NL*
among
those
who
scoffed
at
the
idea
of
these
huge
concerns
cheating
;
*NL*
and
so
now
he
could
appreciate
the
bitter
irony
of
the
fact
that
it
was
*NL*
precisely
their
size
which
enabled
them
to
do
it
with
impunity
.
One
of
*NL*
the
rules
on
the
killing
beds
was
that
a
man
who
was
one
minute
late
*NL*
was
docked
an
hour
;
and
this
was
economical
,
for
he
was
made
to
work
the
*NL*
balance
of
the
hour
--
he
was
not
allowed
to
stand
round
and
wait
.
And
on
*NL*
the
other
hand
if
he
came
ahead
of
time
he
got
no
pay
for
that
--
though
*NL*
often
the
bosses
would
start
up
the
gang
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
before
*NL*
the
whistle
.
And
this
same
custom
they
carried
over
to
the
end
of
the
*NL*
day
;
they
did
not
pay
for
any
fraction
of
an
hour
--
for
``
broken
time
.
''
A
*NL*
man
might
work
full
fifty
minutes
,
but
if
there
was
no
work
to
fill
out
*NL*
the
hour
,
there
was
no
pay
for
him
.
Thus
the
end
of
every
day
was
a
*NL*
sort
of
lottery
--
a
struggle
,
all
but
breaking
into
open
war
between
*NL*
the
bosses
and
the
men
,
the
former
trying
to
rush
a
job
through
and
*NL*
the
latter
trying
to
stretch
it
out
.
Jurgis
blamed
the
bosses
for
this
,
*NL*
though
the
truth
to
be
told
it
was
not
always
their
fault
;
for
the
*NL*
packers
kept
them
frightened
for
their
lives
--
and
when
one
was
in
danger
*NL*
of
falling
behind
the
standard
,
what
was
easier
than
to
catch
up
*NL*
by
making
the
gang
work
awhile
``
for
the
church
''
?
This
was
a
savage
*NL*
witticism
the
men
had
,
which
Jurgis
had
to
have
explained
to
him
.
Old
*NL*
man
Jones
was
great
on
missions
and
such
things
,
and
so
whenever
they
*NL*
were
doing
some
particularly
disreputable
job
,
the
men
would
wink
at
*NL*
each
other
and
say
,
``
Now
we
're
working
for
the
church
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
consequences
of
all
these
things
was
that
Jurgis
was
no
*NL*
longer
perplexed
when
he
heard
men
talk
of
fighting
for
their
rights
.
*NL*
He
felt
like
fighting
now
himself
;
and
when
the
Irish
delegate
of
the
*NL*
butcher-helpers
'
union
came
to
him
a
second
time
,
he
received
him
in
a
*NL*
far
different
spirit
.
A
wonderful
idea
it
now
seemed
to
Jurgis
,
this
*NL*
of
the
men
--
that
by
combining
they
might
be
able
to
make
a
stand
and
*NL*
conquer
the
packers
!
Jurgis
wondered
who
had
first
thought
of
it
;
and
*NL*
when
he
was
told
that
it
was
a
common
thing
for
men
to
do
in
America
,
he
*NL*
got
the
first
inkling
of
a
meaning
in
the
phrase
``
a
free
country
.
''
The
*NL*
delegate
explained
to
him
how
it
depended
upon
their
being
able
to
get
*NL*
every
man
to
join
and
stand
by
the
organization
,
and
so
Jurgis
signified
*NL*
that
he
was
willing
to
do
his
share
.
Before
another
month
was
by
,
all
*NL*
the
working
members
of
his
family
had
union
cards
,
and
wore
their
union
*NL*
buttons
conspicuously
and
with
pride
.
For
fully
a
week
they
were
quite
*NL*
blissfully
happy
,
thinking
that
belonging
to
a
union
meant
an
end
to
all
*NL*
their
troubles
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
only
ten
days
after
she
had
joined
,
Marija
's
canning
factory
closed
*NL*
down
,
and
that
blow
quite
staggered
them
.
They
could
not
understand
why
*NL*
the
union
had
not
prevented
it
,
and
the
very
first
time
she
attended
*NL*
a
meeting
Marija
got
up
and
made
a
speech
about
it
.
It
was
a
business
*NL*
meeting
,
and
was
transacted
in
English
,
but
that
made
no
difference
to
*NL*
Marija
;
she
said
what
was
in
her
,
and
all
the
pounding
of
the
chairman
's
*NL*
gavel
and
all
the
uproar
and
confusion
in
the
room
could
not
prevail
.
*NL*
Quite
apart
from
her
own
troubles
she
was
boiling
over
with
a
general
*NL*
sense
of
the
injustice
of
it
,
and
she
told
what
she
thought
of
the
*NL*
packers
,
and
what
she
thought
of
a
world
where
such
things
were
allowed
*NL*
to
happen
;
and
then
,
while
the
echoes
of
the
hall
rang
with
the
shock
*NL*
of
her
terrible
voice
,
she
sat
down
again
and
fanned
herself
,
and
the
*NL*
meeting
gathered
itself
together
and
proceeded
to
discuss
the
election
*NL*
of
a
recording
secretary
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
too
had
an
adventure
the
first
time
he
attended
a
union
meeting
,
*NL*
but
it
was
not
of
his
own
seeking
.
Jurgis
had
gone
with
the
desire
*NL*
to
get
into
an
inconspicuous
corner
and
see
what
was
done
;
but
this
*NL*
attitude
of
silent
and
open-eyed
attention
had
marked
him
out
for
a
*NL*
victim
.
Tommy
Finnegan
was
a
little
Irishman
,
with
big
staring
eyes
and
*NL*
a
wild
aspect
,
a
``
hoister
''
by
trade
,
and
badly
cracked
.
Somewhere
back
*NL*
in
the
far-distant
past
Tommy
Finnegan
had
had
a
strange
experience
,
*NL*
and
the
burden
of
it
rested
upon
him
.
All
the
balance
of
his
life
he
had
*NL*
done
nothing
but
try
to
make
it
understood
.
When
he
talked
he
caught
*NL*
his
victim
by
the
buttonhole
,
and
his
face
kept
coming
closer
and
*NL*
closer
--
which
was
trying
,
because
his
teeth
were
so
bad
.
Jurgis
did
not
*NL*
mind
that
,
only
he
was
frightened
.
The
method
of
operation
of
the
higher
*NL*
intelligences
was
Tom
Finnegan
's
theme
,
and
he
desired
to
find
out
if
*NL*
Jurgis
had
ever
considered
that
the
representation
of
things
in
their
*NL*
present
similarity
might
be
altogether
unintelligible
upon
a
more
*NL*
elevated
plane
.
There
were
assuredly
wonderful
mysteries
about
the
*NL*
developing
of
these
things
;
and
then
,
becoming
confidential
,
Mr.
*NL*
Finnegan
proceeded
to
tell
of
some
discoveries
of
his
own
.
``
If
ye
have
*NL*
iver
had
onything
to
do
wid
shperrits
,
''
said
he
,
and
looked
inquiringly
*NL*
at
Jurgis
,
who
kept
shaking
his
head
.
``
Niver
mind
,
niver
mind
,
''
*NL*
continued
the
other
,
``
but
their
influences
may
be
operatin
'
upon
ye
;
*NL*
it
's
shure
as
I
'm
tellin
'
ye
,
it
's
them
that
has
the
reference
to
the
*NL*
immejit
surroundin
's
that
has
the
most
of
power
.
It
was
vouchsafed
to
*NL*
me
in
me
youthful
days
to
be
acquainted
with
shperrits
''
and
so
*NL*
Tommy
Finnegan
went
on
,
expounding
a
system
of
philosophy
,
while
the
*NL*
perspiration
came
out
on
Jurgis
'
forehead
,
so
great
was
his
agitation
*NL*
and
embarrassment
.
In
the
end
one
of
the
men
,
seeing
his
plight
,
came
*NL*
over
and
rescued
him
;
but
it
was
some
time
before
he
was
able
to
find
*NL*
any
one
to
explain
things
to
him
,
and
meanwhile
his
fear
lest
the
*NL*
strange
little
Irishman
should
get
him
cornered
again
was
enough
to
keep
*NL*
him
dodging
about
the
room
the
whole
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
never
missed
a
meeting
,
however
.
He
had
picked
up
a
few
words
of
*NL*
English
by
this
time
,
and
friends
would
help
him
to
understand
.
They
*NL*
were
often
very
turbulent
meetings
,
with
half
a
dozen
men
declaiming
*NL*
at
once
,
in
as
many
dialects
of
English
;
but
the
speakers
were
all
*NL*
desperately
in
earnest
,
and
Jurgis
was
in
earnest
too
,
for
he
understood
*NL*
that
a
fight
was
on
,
and
that
it
was
his
fight
.
Since
the
time
of
his
*NL*
disillusionment
,
Jurgis
had
sworn
to
trust
no
man
,
except
in
his
own
*NL*
family
;
but
here
he
discovered
that
he
had
brothers
in
affliction
,
and
*NL*
allies
.
Their
one
chance
for
life
was
in
union
,
and
so
the
struggle
*NL*
became
a
kind
of
crusade
.
Jurgis
had
always
been
a
member
of
the
church
,
*NL*
because
it
was
the
right
thing
to
be
,
but
the
church
had
never
*NL*
touched
him
,
he
left
all
that
for
the
women
.
Here
,
however
,
was
a
new
*NL*
religion
--
one
that
did
touch
him
,
that
took
hold
of
every
fiber
of
him
;
*NL*
and
with
all
the
zeal
and
fury
of
a
convert
he
went
out
as
a
missionary
.
*NL*
There
were
many
nonunion
men
among
the
Lithuanians
,
and
with
these
*NL*
he
would
labor
and
wrestle
in
prayer
,
trying
to
show
them
the
right
.
*NL*
Sometimes
they
would
be
obstinate
and
refuse
to
see
it
,
and
Jurgis
,
*NL*
alas
,
was
not
always
patient
!
He
forgot
how
he
himself
had
been
blind
,
*NL*
a
short
time
ago
--
after
the
fashion
of
all
crusaders
since
the
original
*NL*
ones
,
who
set
out
to
spread
the
gospel
of
Brotherhood
by
force
of
arms
.

Chapter
9
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
first
consequences
of
the
discovery
of
the
union
was
that
*NL*
Jurgis
became
desirous
of
learning
English
.
He
wanted
to
know
what
was
*NL*
going
on
at
the
meetings
,
and
to
be
able
to
take
part
in
them
,
and
so
he
*NL*
began
to
look
about
him
,
and
to
try
to
pick
up
words
.
The
children
,
who
*NL*
were
at
school
,
and
learning
fast
,
would
teach
him
a
few
;
and
a
friend
*NL*
loaned
him
a
little
book
that
had
some
in
it
,
and
Ona
would
read
them
to
*NL*
him
.
Then
Jurgis
became
sorry
that
he
could
not
read
himself
;
and
later
*NL*
on
in
the
winter
,
when
some
one
told
him
that
there
was
a
night
school
*NL*
that
was
free
,
he
went
and
enrolled
.
After
that
,
every
evening
that
he
*NL*
got
home
from
the
yards
in
time
,
he
would
go
to
the
school
;
he
would
go
*NL*
even
if
he
were
in
time
for
only
half
an
hour
.
They
were
teaching
him
*NL*
both
to
read
and
to
speak
English
--
and
they
would
have
taught
him
other
*NL*
things
,
if
only
he
had
had
a
little
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Also
the
union
made
another
great
difference
with
him
--
it
made
him
begin
*NL*
to
pay
attention
to
the
country
.
It
was
the
beginning
of
democracy
with
*NL*
him
.
It
was
a
little
state
,
the
union
,
a
miniature
republic
;
its
affairs
*NL*
were
every
man
's
affairs
,
and
every
man
had
a
real
say
about
them
.
In
*NL*
other
words
,
in
the
union
Jurgis
learned
to
talk
politics
.
In
the
place
*NL*
where
he
had
come
from
there
had
not
been
any
politics
--
in
Russia
one
*NL*
thought
of
the
government
as
an
affliction
like
the
lightning
and
the
*NL*
hail
.
``
Duck
,
little
brother
,
duck
,
''
the
wise
old
peasants
would
whisper
;
*NL*
``
everything
passes
away
.
''
And
when
Jurgis
had
first
come
to
America
he
*NL*
had
supposed
that
it
was
the
same
.
He
had
heard
people
say
that
it
was
*NL*
a
free
country
--
but
what
did
that
mean
?
He
found
that
here
,
precisely
*NL*
as
in
Russia
,
there
were
rich
men
who
owned
everything
;
and
if
one
could
*NL*
not
find
any
work
,
was
not
the
hunger
he
began
to
feel
the
same
sort
of
*NL*
hunger
?
*NL*
*NL*
When
Jurgis
had
been
working
about
three
weeks
at
Brown
's
,
there
had
*NL*
come
to
him
one
noontime
a
man
who
was
employed
as
a
night
watchman
,
and
*NL*
who
asked
him
if
he
would
not
like
to
take
out
naturalization
papers
*NL*
and
become
a
citizen
.
Jurgis
did
not
know
what
that
meant
,
but
the
man
*NL*
explained
the
advantages
.
In
the
first
place
,
it
would
not
cost
him
*NL*
anything
,
and
it
would
get
him
half
a
day
off
,
with
his
pay
just
the
*NL*
same
;
and
then
when
election
time
came
he
would
be
able
to
vote
--
and
*NL*
there
was
something
in
that
.
Jurgis
was
naturally
glad
to
accept
,
and
so
*NL*
the
night
watchman
said
a
few
words
to
the
boss
,
and
he
was
excused
for
*NL*
the
rest
of
the
day
.
When
,
later
on
,
he
wanted
a
holiday
to
get
married
*NL*
he
could
not
get
it
;
and
as
for
a
holiday
with
pay
just
the
same
--
what
*NL*
power
had
wrought
that
miracle
heaven
only
knew
!
However
,
he
went
with
*NL*
the
man
,
who
picked
up
several
other
newly
landed
immigrants
,
Poles
,
*NL*
Lithuanians
,
and
Slovaks
,
and
took
them
all
outside
,
where
stood
a
great
*NL*
four-horse
tallyho
coach
,
with
fifteen
or
twenty
men
already
in
it
.
It
*NL*
was
a
fine
chance
to
see
the
sights
of
the
city
,
and
the
party
had
a
*NL*
merry
time
,
with
plenty
of
beer
handed
up
from
inside
.
So
they
drove
*NL*
downtown
and
stopped
before
an
imposing
granite
building
,
in
which
they
*NL*
interviewed
an
official
,
who
had
the
papers
all
ready
,
with
only
the
*NL*
names
to
be
filled
in
.
So
each
man
in
turn
took
an
oath
of
which
he
did
*NL*
not
understand
a
word
,
and
then
was
presented
with
a
handsome
ornamented
*NL*
document
with
a
big
red
seal
and
the
shield
of
the
United
States
upon
*NL*
it
,
and
was
told
that
he
had
become
a
citizen
of
the
Republic
and
the
*NL*
equal
of
the
President
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
month
or
two
later
Jurgis
had
another
interview
with
this
same
man
,
*NL*
who
told
him
where
to
go
to
``
register
.
''
And
then
finally
,
when
election
*NL*
day
came
,
the
packing
houses
posted
a
notice
that
men
who
desired
to
*NL*
vote
might
remain
away
until
nine
that
morning
,
and
the
same
night
*NL*
watchman
took
Jurgis
and
the
rest
of
his
flock
into
the
back
room
of
a
*NL*
saloon
,
and
showed
each
of
them
where
and
how
to
mark
a
ballot
,
and
then
*NL*
gave
each
two
dollars
,
and
took
them
to
the
polling
place
,
where
there
*NL*
was
a
policeman
on
duty
especially
to
see
that
they
got
through
all
*NL*
right
.
Jurgis
felt
quite
proud
of
this
good
luck
till
he
got
home
and
*NL*
met
Jonas
,
who
had
taken
the
leader
aside
and
whispered
to
him
,
offering
*NL*
to
vote
three
times
for
four
dollars
,
which
offer
had
been
accepted
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
in
the
union
Jurgis
met
men
who
explained
all
this
mystery
*NL*
to
him
;
and
he
learned
that
America
differed
from
Russia
in
that
its
*NL*
government
existed
under
the
form
of
a
democracy
.
The
officials
who
*NL*
ruled
it
,
and
got
all
the
graft
,
had
to
be
elected
first
;
and
so
there
*NL*
were
two
rival
sets
of
grafters
,
known
as
political
parties
,
and
the
one
*NL*
got
the
office
which
bought
the
most
votes
.
Now
and
then
,
the
election
*NL*
was
very
close
,
and
that
was
the
time
the
poor
man
came
in
.
In
the
*NL*
stockyards
this
was
only
in
national
and
state
elections
,
for
in
local
*NL*
elections
the
Democratic
Party
always
carried
everything
.
The
ruler
of
*NL*
the
district
was
therefore
the
Democratic
boss
,
a
little
Irishman
named
*NL*
Mike
Scully
.
Scully
held
an
important
party
office
in
the
state
,
and
*NL*
bossed
even
the
mayor
of
the
city
,
it
was
said
;
it
was
his
boast
that
he
*NL*
carried
the
stockyards
in
his
pocket
.
He
was
an
enormously
rich
man
--
he
*NL*
had
a
hand
in
all
the
big
graft
in
the
neighborhood
.
It
was
Scully
,
for
*NL*
instance
,
who
owned
that
dump
which
Jurgis
and
Ona
had
seen
the
first
*NL*
day
of
their
arrival
.
Not
only
did
he
own
the
dump
,
but
he
owned
the
*NL*
brick
factory
as
well
,
and
first
he
took
out
the
clay
and
made
it
into
*NL*
bricks
,
and
then
he
had
the
city
bring
garbage
to
fill
up
the
hole
,
so
*NL*
that
he
could
build
houses
to
sell
to
the
people
.
Then
,
too
,
he
sold
the
*NL*
bricks
to
the
city
,
at
his
own
price
,
and
the
city
came
and
got
them
*NL*
in
its
own
wagons
.
And
also
he
owned
the
other
hole
near
by
,
where
the
*NL*
stagnant
water
was
;
and
it
was
he
who
cut
the
ice
and
sold
it
;
and
what
*NL*
was
more
,
if
the
men
told
truth
,
he
had
not
had
to
pay
any
taxes
for
the
*NL*
water
,
and
he
had
built
the
ice-house
out
of
city
lumber
,
and
had
not
had
*NL*
to
pay
anything
for
that
.
The
newspapers
had
got
hold
of
that
story
,
and
*NL*
there
had
been
a
scandal
;
but
Scully
had
hired
somebody
to
confess
and
*NL*
take
all
the
blame
,
and
then
skip
the
country
.
It
was
said
,
too
,
that
he
*NL*
had
built
his
brick-kiln
in
the
same
way
,
and
that
the
workmen
were
on
*NL*
the
city
payroll
while
they
did
it
;
however
,
one
had
to
press
closely
to
*NL*
get
these
things
out
of
the
men
,
for
it
was
not
their
business
,
and
Mike
*NL*
Scully
was
a
good
man
to
stand
in
with
.
A
note
signed
by
him
was
equal
*NL*
to
a
job
any
time
at
the
packing
houses
;
and
also
he
employed
a
good
*NL*
many
men
himself
,
and
worked
them
only
eight
hours
a
day
,
and
paid
them
*NL*
the
highest
wages
.
This
gave
him
many
friends
--
all
of
whom
he
had
gotten
*NL*
together
into
the
``
War
Whoop
League
,
''
whose
clubhouse
you
might
see
*NL*
just
outside
of
the
yards
.
It
was
the
biggest
clubhouse
,
and
the
biggest
*NL*
club
,
in
all
Chicago
;
and
they
had
prizefights
every
now
and
then
,
*NL*
and
cockfights
and
even
dogfights
.
The
policemen
in
the
district
all
*NL*
belonged
to
the
league
,
and
instead
of
suppressing
the
fights
,
they
sold
*NL*
tickets
for
them
.
The
man
that
had
taken
Jurgis
to
be
naturalized
was
*NL*
one
of
these
``
Indians
,
''
as
they
were
called
;
and
on
election
day
there
*NL*
would
be
hundreds
of
them
out
,
and
all
with
big
wads
of
money
in
their
*NL*
pockets
and
free
drinks
at
every
saloon
in
the
district
.
That
was
*NL*
another
thing
,
the
men
said
--
all
the
saloon-keepers
had
to
be
``
Indians
,
''
*NL*
and
to
put
up
on
demand
,
otherwise
they
could
not
do
business
on
*NL*
Sundays
,
nor
have
any
gambling
at
all
.
In
the
same
way
Scully
had
all
*NL*
the
jobs
in
the
fire
department
at
his
disposal
,
and
all
the
rest
of
the
*NL*
city
graft
in
the
stockyards
district
;
he
was
building
a
block
of
flats
*NL*
somewhere
up
on
Ashland
Avenue
,
and
the
man
who
was
overseeing
it
for
*NL*
him
was
drawing
pay
as
a
city
inspector
of
sewers
.
The
city
inspector
of
*NL*
water
pipes
had
been
dead
and
buried
for
over
a
year
,
but
somebody
was
*NL*
still
drawing
his
pay
.
The
city
inspector
of
sidewalks
was
a
barkeeper
*NL*
at
the
War
Whoop
Cafe
--
and
maybe
he
could
make
it
uncomfortable
for
any
*NL*
tradesman
who
did
not
stand
in
with
Scully
!
*NL*
*NL*
Even
the
packers
were
in
awe
of
him
,
so
the
men
said
.
It
gave
them
*NL*
pleasure
to
believe
this
,
for
Scully
stood
as
the
people
's
man
,
and
*NL*
boasted
of
it
boldly
when
election
day
came
.
The
packers
had
wanted
a
*NL*
bridge
at
Ashland
Avenue
,
but
they
had
not
been
able
to
get
it
till
they
*NL*
had
seen
Scully
;
and
it
was
the
same
with
``
Bubbly
Creek
,
''
which
the
city
*NL*
had
threatened
to
make
the
packers
cover
over
,
till
Scully
had
come
to
*NL*
their
aid
.
``
Bubbly
Creek
''
is
an
arm
of
the
Chicago
River
,
and
forms
the
*NL*
southern
boundary
of
the
yards
:
all
the
drainage
of
the
square
mile
of
*NL*
packing
houses
empties
into
it
,
so
that
it
is
really
a
great
open
sewer
*NL*
a
hundred
or
two
feet
wide
.
One
long
arm
of
it
is
blind
,
and
the
filth
*NL*
stays
there
forever
and
a
day
.
The
grease
and
chemicals
that
are
poured
*NL*
into
it
undergo
all
sorts
of
strange
transformations
,
which
are
the
*NL*
cause
of
its
name
;
it
is
constantly
in
motion
,
as
if
huge
fish
were
*NL*
feeding
in
it
,
or
great
leviathans
disporting
themselves
in
its
depths
.
*NL*
Bubbles
of
carbonic
acid
gas
will
rise
to
the
surface
and
burst
,
and
*NL*
make
rings
two
or
three
feet
wide
.
Here
and
there
the
grease
and
filth
*NL*
have
caked
solid
,
and
the
creek
looks
like
a
bed
of
lava
;
chickens
walk
*NL*
about
on
it
,
feeding
,
and
many
times
an
unwary
stranger
has
started
to
*NL*
stroll
across
,
and
vanished
temporarily
.
The
packers
used
to
leave
the
*NL*
creek
that
way
,
till
every
now
and
then
the
surface
would
catch
on
fire
*NL*
and
burn
furiously
,
and
the
fire
department
would
have
to
come
and
put
*NL*
it
out
.
Once
,
however
,
an
ingenious
stranger
came
and
started
to
gather
*NL*
this
filth
in
scows
,
to
make
lard
out
of
;
then
the
packers
took
the
*NL*
cue
,
and
got
out
an
injunction
to
stop
him
,
and
afterward
gathered
it
*NL*
themselves
.
The
banks
of
``
Bubbly
Creek
''
are
plastered
thick
with
hairs
,
*NL*
and
this
also
the
packers
gather
and
clean
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
there
were
things
even
stranger
than
this
,
according
to
the
gossip
*NL*
of
the
men
.
The
packers
had
secret
mains
,
through
which
they
stole
*NL*
billions
of
gallons
of
the
city
's
water
.
The
newspapers
had
been
full
of
*NL*
this
scandal
--
once
there
had
even
been
an
investigation
,
and
an
actual
*NL*
uncovering
of
the
pipes
;
but
nobody
had
been
punished
,
and
the
thing
*NL*
went
right
on
.
And
then
there
was
the
condemned
meat
industry
,
with
its
*NL*
endless
horrors
.
The
people
of
Chicago
saw
the
government
inspectors
*NL*
in
Packingtown
,
and
they
all
took
that
to
mean
that
they
were
protected
*NL*
from
diseased
meat
;
they
did
not
understand
that
these
hundred
and
*NL*
sixty-three
inspectors
had
been
appointed
at
the
request
of
the
packers
,
*NL*
and
that
they
were
paid
by
the
United
States
government
to
certify
*NL*
that
all
the
diseased
meat
was
kept
in
the
state
.
They
had
no
authority
*NL*
beyond
that
;
for
the
inspection
of
meat
to
be
sold
in
the
city
and
state
*NL*
the
whole
force
in
Packingtown
consisted
of
three
henchmen
of
the
local
*NL*
political
machine

And
shortly
afterward
one
of
these
,
a
physician
,
made
the
discovery
that
*NL*
the
carcasses
of
steers
which
had
been
condemned
as
tubercular
by
the
*NL*
government
inspectors
,
and
which
therefore
contained
ptomaines
,
which
*NL*
are
deadly
poisons
,
were
left
upon
an
open
platform
and
carted
away
to
*NL*
be
sold
in
the
city
;
and
so
he
insisted
that
these
carcasses
be
treated
*NL*
with
an
injection
of
kerosene
--
and
was
ordered
to
resign
the
same
week
!
*NL*
So
indignant
were
the
packers
that
they
went
farther
,
and
compelled
*NL*
the
mayor
to
abolish
the
whole
bureau
of
inspection
;
so
that
since
then
*NL*
there
has
not
been
even
a
pretense
of
any
interference
with
the
graft
.
*NL*
There
was
said
to
be
two
thousand
dollars
a
week
hush
money
from
the
*NL*
tubercular
steers
alone
;
and
as
much
again
from
the
hogs
which
had
died
*NL*
of
cholera
on
the
trains
,
and
which
you
might
see
any
day
being
loaded
*NL*
into
boxcars
and
hauled
away
to
a
place
called
Globe
,
in
Indiana
,
where
*NL*
they
made
a
fancy
grade
of
lard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
heard
of
these
things
little
by
little
,
in
the
gossip
of
those
*NL*
who
were
obliged
to
perpetrate
them
.
It
seemed
as
if
every
time
you
*NL*
met
a
person
from
a
new
department
,
you
heard
of
new
swindles
and
new
*NL*
crimes
.
There
was
,
for
instance
,
a
Lithuanian
who
was
a
cattle
butcher
*NL*
for
the
plant
where
Marija
had
worked
,
which
killed
meat
for
canning
*NL*
only
;
and
to
hear
this
man
describe
the
animals
which
came
to
his
place
*NL*
would
have
been
worthwhile
for
a
Dante
or
a
Zola
.
It
seemed
that
they
*NL*
must
have
agencies
all
over
the
country
,
to
hunt
out
old
and
crippled
*NL*
and
diseased
cattle
to
be
canned
.
There
were
cattle
which
had
been
fed
*NL*
on
``
whisky-malt
,
''
the
refuse
of
the
breweries
,
and
had
become
what
the
*NL*
men
called
``
steerly
''
--
which
means
covered
with
boils
.
It
was
a
nasty
*NL*
job
killing
these
,
for
when
you
plunged
your
knife
into
them
they
would
*NL*
burst
and
splash
foul-smelling
stuff
into
your
face
;
and
when
a
man
's
*NL*
sleeves
were
smeared
with
blood
,
and
his
hands
steeped
in
it
,
how
was
he
*NL*
ever
to
wipe
his
face
,
or
to
clear
his
eyes
so
that
he
could
see
?
It
was
*NL*
stuff
such
as
this
that
made
the
``
embalmed
beef
''
that
had
killed
*NL*
several
times
as
many
United
States
soldiers
as
all
the
bullets
of
the
*NL*
Spaniards
;
only
the
army
beef
,
besides
,
was
not
fresh
canned
,
it
was
old
*NL*
stuff
that
had
been
lying
for
years
in
the
cellars
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
one
Sunday
evening
,
Jurgis
sat
puffing
his
pipe
by
the
kitchen
*NL*
stove
,
and
talking
with
an
old
fellow
whom
Jonas
had
introduced
,
and
*NL*
who
worked
in
the
canning
rooms
at
Durham
's
;
and
so
Jurgis
learned
a
few
*NL*
things
about
the
great
and
only
Durham
canned
goods
,
which
had
become
*NL*
a
national
institution
.
They
were
regular
alchemists
at
Durham
's
;
they
*NL*
advertised
a
mushroom-catsup
,
and
the
men
who
made
it
did
not
know
what
*NL*
a
mushroom
looked
like
.
They
advertised
``
potted
chicken
,
''
--
and
it
was
*NL*
like
the
boardinghouse
soup
of
the
comic
papers
,
through
which
a
chicken
*NL*
had
walked
with
rubbers
on
.
Perhaps
they
had
a
secret
process
for
making
*NL*
chickens
chemically
--
who
knows
?
said
Jurgis
'
friend
;
the
things
that
*NL*
went
into
the
mixture
were
tripe
,
and
the
fat
of
pork
,
and
beef
suet
,
*NL*
and
hearts
of
beef
,
and
finally
the
waste
ends
of
veal
,
when
they
had
*NL*
any
.
They
put
these
up
in
several
grades
,
and
sold
them
at
several
*NL*
prices
;
but
the
contents
of
the
cans
all
came
out
of
the
same
hopper
.
*NL*
And
then
there
was
``
potted
game
''
and
``
potted
grouse
,
''
``
potted
ham
,
''
and
*NL*
``
deviled
ham
''
--
de-vyled
,
as
the
men
called
it
.
``
De-vyled
''
ham
was
made
*NL*
out
of
the
waste
ends
of
smoked
beef
that
were
too
small
to
be
sliced
by
*NL*
the
machines
;
and
also
tripe
,
dyed
with
chemicals
so
that
it
would
not
*NL*
show
white
;
and
trimmings
of
hams
and
corned
beef
;
and
potatoes
,
skins
*NL*
and
all
;
and
finally
the
hard
cartilaginous
gullets
of
beef
,
after
the
*NL*
tongues
had
been
cut
out
.
All
this
ingenious
mixture
was
ground
up
and
*NL*
flavored
with
spices
to
make
it
taste
like
something
.
Anybody
who
could
*NL*
invent
a
new
imitation
had
been
sure
of
a
fortune
from
old
Durham
,
said
*NL*
Jurgis
'
informant
;
but
it
was
hard
to
think
of
anything
new
in
a
*NL*
place
where
so
many
sharp
wits
had
been
at
work
for
so
long
;
where
men
*NL*
welcomed
tuberculosis
in
the
cattle
they
were
feeding
,
because
it
made
*NL*
them
fatten
more
quickly
;
and
where
they
bought
up
all
the
old
rancid
*NL*
butter
left
over
in
the
grocery
stores
of
a
continent
,
and
``
oxidized
''
it
*NL*
by
a
forced-air
process
,
to
take
away
the
odor
,
rechurned
it
with
skim
*NL*
milk
,
and
sold
it
in
bricks
in
the
cities
!
Up
to
a
year
or
two
ago
*NL*
it
had
been
the
custom
to
kill
horses
in
the
yards
--
ostensibly
for
*NL*
fertilizer
;
but
after
long
agitation
the
newspapers
had
been
able
to
*NL*
make
the
public
realize
that
the
horses
were
being
canned
.
Now
it
was
*NL*
against
the
law
to
kill
horses
in
Packingtown
,
and
the
law
was
really
*NL*
complied
with
--
for
the
present
,
at
any
rate
.
Any
day
,
however
,
one
might
*NL*
see
sharp-horned
and
shaggy-haired
creatures
running
with
the
sheep
and
*NL*
yet
what
a
job
you
would
have
to
get
the
public
to
believe
that
a
good
*NL*
part
of
what
it
buys
for
lamb
and
mutton
is
really
goat
's
flesh
!
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
another
interesting
set
of
statistics
that
a
person
might
*NL*
have
gathered
in
Packingtown
--
those
of
the
various
afflictions
of
*NL*
the
workers
.
When
Jurgis
had
first
inspected
the
packing
plants
with
*NL*
Szedvilas
,
he
had
marveled
while
he
listened
to
the
tale
of
all
the
*NL*
things
that
were
made
out
of
the
carcasses
of
animals
,
and
of
all
the
*NL*
lesser
industries
that
were
maintained
there
;
now
he
found
that
each
one
*NL*
of
these
lesser
industries
was
a
separate
little
inferno
,
in
its
way
as
*NL*
horrible
as
the
killing
beds
,
the
source
and
fountain
of
them
all
.
*NL*
The
workers
in
each
of
them
had
their
own
peculiar
diseases
.
And
the
*NL*
wandering
visitor
might
be
skeptical
about
all
the
swindles
,
but
he
*NL*
could
not
be
skeptical
about
these
,
for
the
worker
bore
the
evidence
*NL*
of
them
about
on
his
own
person
--
generally
he
had
only
to
hold
out
his
*NL*
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
the
men
in
the
pickle
rooms
,
for
instance
,
where
old
Antanas
*NL*
had
gotten
his
death
;
scarce
a
one
of
these
that
had
not
some
spot
of
*NL*
horror
on
his
person
.
Let
a
man
so
much
as
scrape
his
finger
pushing
a
*NL*
truck
in
the
pickle
rooms
,
and
he
might
have
a
sore
that
would
put
him
*NL*
out
of
the
world
;
all
the
joints
in
his
fingers
might
be
eaten
by
the
*NL*
acid
,
one
by
one
.
Of
the
butchers
and
floorsmen
,
the
beef-boners
and
*NL*
trimmers
,
and
all
those
who
used
knives
,
you
could
scarcely
find
a
*NL*
person
who
had
the
use
of
his
thumb
;
time
and
time
again
the
base
of
it
*NL*
had
been
slashed
,
till
it
was
a
mere
lump
of
flesh
against
which
the
*NL*
man
pressed
the
knife
to
hold
it
.
The
hands
of
these
men
would
be
*NL*
criss-crossed
with
cuts
,
until
you
could
no
longer
pretend
to
count
*NL*
them
or
to
trace
them
.
They
would
have
no
nails
,
--
they
had
worn
them
off
*NL*
pulling
hides
;
their
knuckles
were
swollen
so
that
their
fingers
spread
*NL*
out
like
a
fan
.
There
were
men
who
worked
in
the
cooking
rooms
,
in
the
*NL*
midst
of
steam
and
sickening
odors
,
by
artificial
light
;
in
these
rooms
*NL*
the
germs
of
tuberculosis
might
live
for
two
years
,
but
the
supply
*NL*
was
renewed
every
hour
.
There
were
the
beef-luggers
,
who
carried
*NL*
two-hundred-pound
quarters
into
the
refrigerator-cars
;
a
fearful
kind
of
*NL*
work
,
that
began
at
four
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
and
that
wore
out
the
*NL*
most
powerful
men
in
a
few
years
.
There
were
those
who
worked
in
the
*NL*
chilling
rooms
,
and
whose
special
disease
was
rheumatism
;
the
time
limit
*NL*
that
a
man
could
work
in
the
chilling
rooms
was
said
to
be
five
years
.
*NL*
There
were
the
wool-pluckers
,
whose
hands
went
to
pieces
even
sooner
*NL*
than
the
hands
of
the
pickle
men
;
for
the
pelts
of
the
sheep
had
to
be
*NL*
painted
with
acid
to
loosen
the
wool
,
and
then
the
pluckers
had
to
*NL*
pull
out
this
wool
with
their
bare
hands
,
till
the
acid
had
eaten
their
*NL*
fingers
off
.
There
were
those
who
made
the
tins
for
the
canned
meat
;
and
*NL*
their
hands
,
too
,
were
a
maze
of
cuts
,
and
each
cut
represented
a
chance
*NL*
for
blood
poisoning
.
Some
worked
at
the
stamping
machines
,
and
it
was
*NL*
very
seldom
that
one
could
work
long
there
at
the
pace
that
was
set
,
and
*NL*
not
give
out
and
forget
himself
and
have
a
part
of
his
hand
chopped
off
.
*NL*
There
were
the
``
hoisters
,
''
as
they
were
called
,
whose
task
it
was
to
*NL*
press
the
lever
which
lifted
the
dead
cattle
off
the
floor
.
They
ran
*NL*
along
upon
a
rafter
,
peering
down
through
the
damp
and
the
steam
;
and
*NL*
as
old
Durham
's
architects
had
not
built
the
killing
room
for
the
*NL*
convenience
of
the
hoisters
,
at
every
few
feet
they
would
have
to
stoop
*NL*
under
a
beam
,
say
four
feet
above
the
one
they
ran
on
;
which
got
them
*NL*
into
the
habit
of
stooping
,
so
that
in
a
few
years
they
would
be
walking
*NL*
like
chimpanzees
.
Worst
of
any
,
however
,
were
the
fertilizer
men
,
and
*NL*
those
who
served
in
the
cooking
rooms
.
These
people
could
not
be
shown
*NL*
to
the
visitor
,
--
for
the
odor
of
a
fertilizer
man
would
scare
any
*NL*
ordinary
visitor
at
a
hundred
yards
,
and
as
for
the
other
men
,
who
*NL*
worked
in
tank
rooms
full
of
steam
,
and
in
some
of
which
there
were
open
*NL*
vats
near
the
level
of
the
floor
,
their
peculiar
trouble
was
that
they
*NL*
fell
into
the
vats
;
and
when
they
were
fished
out
,
there
was
never
*NL*
enough
of
them
left
to
be
worth
exhibiting
,
--
sometimes
they
would
be
*NL*
overlooked
for
days
,
till
all
but
the
bones
of
them
had
gone
out

Chapter
10
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
early
part
of
the
winter
the
family
had
had
money
enough
to
*NL*
live
and
a
little
over
to
pay
their
debts
with
;
but
when
the
earnings
of
*NL*
Jurgis
fell
from
nine
or
ten
dollars
a
week
to
five
or
six
,
there
was
*NL*
no
longer
anything
to
spare
.
The
winter
went
,
and
the
spring
came
,
and
*NL*
found
them
still
living
thus
from
hand
to
mouth
,
hanging
on
day
by
day
,
*NL*
with
literally
not
a
month
's
wages
between
them
and
starvation
.
Marija
*NL*
was
in
despair
,
for
there
was
still
no
word
about
the
reopening
of
the
*NL*
canning
factory
,
and
her
savings
were
almost
entirely
gone
.
She
had
had
*NL*
to
give
up
all
idea
of
marrying
then
;
the
family
could
not
get
along
*NL*
without
her
--
though
for
that
matter
she
was
likely
soon
to
become
a
*NL*
burden
even
upon
them
,
for
when
her
money
was
all
gone
,
they
would
have
*NL*
to
pay
back
what
they
owed
her
in
board
.
So
Jurgis
and
Ona
and
Teta
*NL*
Elzbieta
would
hold
anxious
conferences
until
late
at
night
,
trying
to
*NL*
figure
how
they
could
manage
this
too
without
starving
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
were
the
cruel
terms
upon
which
their
life
was
possible
,
that
they
*NL*
might
never
have
nor
expect
a
single
instant
's
respite
from
worry
,
a
*NL*
single
instant
in
which
they
were
not
haunted
by
the
thought
of
money
.
*NL*
They
would
no
sooner
escape
,
as
by
a
miracle
,
from
one
difficulty
,
*NL*
than
a
new
one
would
come
into
view
.
In
addition
to
all
their
physical
*NL*
hardships
,
there
was
thus
a
constant
strain
upon
their
minds
;
they
were
*NL*
harried
all
day
and
nearly
all
night
by
worry
and
fear
.
This
was
in
*NL*
truth
not
living
;
it
was
scarcely
even
existing
,
and
they
felt
that
it
*NL*
was
too
little
for
the
price
they
paid
.
They
were
willing
to
work
all
*NL*
the
time
;
and
when
people
did
their
best
,
ought
they
not
to
be
able
to
*NL*
keep
alive
?
*NL*
*NL*
There
seemed
never
to
be
an
end
to
the
things
they
had
to
buy
and
to
the
*NL*
unforeseen
contingencies
.
Once
their
water
pipes
froze
and
burst
;
and
*NL*
when
,
in
their
ignorance
,
they
thawed
them
out
,
they
had
a
terrifying
*NL*
flood
in
their
house
.
It
happened
while
the
men
were
away
,
and
poor
*NL*
Elzbieta
rushed
out
into
the
street
screaming
for
help
,
for
she
did
*NL*
not
even
know
whether
the
flood
could
be
stopped
,
or
whether
they
were
*NL*
ruined
for
life
.
It
was
nearly
as
bad
as
the
latter
,
they
found
in
*NL*
the
end
,
for
the
plumber
charged
them
seventy-five
cents
an
hour
,
and
*NL*
seventy-five
cents
for
another
man
who
had
stood
and
watched
him
,
and
*NL*
included
all
the
time
the
two
had
been
going
and
coming
,
and
also
a
*NL*
charge
for
all
sorts
of
material
and
extras
.
And
then
again
,
when
*NL*
they
went
to
pay
their
January
's
installment
on
the
house
,
the
agent
*NL*
terrified
them
by
asking
them
if
they
had
had
the
insurance
attended
*NL*
to
yet
.
In
answer
to
their
inquiry
he
showed
them
a
clause
in
the
deed
*NL*
which
provided
that
they
were
to
keep
the
house
insured
for
one
thousand
*NL*
dollars
,
as
soon
as
the
present
policy
ran
out
,
which
would
happen
in
*NL*
a
few
days
.
Poor
Elzbieta
,
upon
whom
again
fell
the
blow
,
demanded
how
*NL*
much
it
would
cost
them
.
Seven
dollars
,
the
man
said
;
and
that
night
*NL*
came
Jurgis
,
grim
and
determined
,
requesting
that
the
agent
would
be
*NL*
good
enough
to
inform
him
,
once
for
all
,
as
to
all
the
expenses
they
*NL*
were
liable
for
.
The
deed
was
signed
now
,
he
said
,
with
sarcasm
proper
*NL*
to
the
new
way
of
life
he
had
learned
--
the
deed
was
signed
,
and
so
the
*NL*
agent
had
no
longer
anything
to
gain
by
keeping
quiet
.
And
Jurgis
looked
*NL*
the
fellow
squarely
in
the
eye
,
and
so
the
fellow
wasted
no
time
in
*NL*
conventional
protests
,
but
read
him
the
deed
.
They
would
have
to
renew
*NL*
the
insurance
every
year
;
they
would
have
to
pay
the
taxes
,
about
ten
*NL*
dollars
a
year
;
they
would
have
to
pay
the
water
tax
,
about
six
dollars
*NL*
a
year
--
-LRB-
Jurgis
silently
resolved
to
shut
off
the
hydrant
-RRB-
.
This
,
*NL*
besides
the
interest
and
the
monthly
installments
,
would
be
all
--
unless
*NL*
by
chance
the
city
should
happen
to
decide
to
put
in
a
sewer
or
to
lay
*NL*
a
sidewalk
.
Yes
,
said
the
agent
,
they
would
have
to
have
these
,
whether
*NL*
they
wanted
them
or
not
,
if
the
city
said
so
.
The
sewer
would
cost
them
*NL*
about
twenty-two
dollars
,
and
the
sidewalk
fifteen
if
it
were
wood
,
*NL*
twenty-five
if
it
were
cement
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
Jurgis
went
home
again
;
it
was
a
relief
to
know
the
worst
,
at
any
*NL*
rate
,
so
that
he
could
no
more
be
surprised
by
fresh
demands
.
He
saw
*NL*
now
how
they
had
been
plundered
;
but
they
were
in
for
it
,
there
was
*NL*
no
turning
back
.
They
could
only
go
on
and
make
the
fight
and
win
--
for
*NL*
defeat
was
a
thing
that
could
not
even
be
thought
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
springtime
came
,
they
were
delivered
from
the
dreadful
cold
,
*NL*
and
that
was
a
great
deal
;
but
in
addition
they
had
counted
on
the
money
*NL*
they
would
not
have
to
pay
for
coal
--
and
it
was
just
at
this
time
that
*NL*
Marija
's
board
began
to
fail
.
Then
,
too
,
the
warm
weather
brought
trials
*NL*
of
its
own
;
each
season
had
its
trials
,
as
they
found
.
In
the
spring
*NL*
there
were
cold
rains
,
that
turned
the
streets
into
canals
and
bogs
;
the
*NL*
mud
would
be
so
deep
that
wagons
would
sink
up
to
the
hubs
,
so
that
half
*NL*
a
dozen
horses
could
not
move
them
.
Then
,
of
course
,
it
was
impossible
*NL*
for
any
one
to
get
to
work
with
dry
feet
;
and
this
was
bad
for
men
that
*NL*
were
poorly
clad
and
shod
,
and
still
worse
for
women
and
children
.
Later
*NL*
came
midsummer
,
with
the
stifling
heat
,
when
the
dingy
killing
beds
of
*NL*
Durham
's
became
a
very
purgatory
;
one
time
,
in
a
single
day
,
three
men
*NL*
fell
dead
from
sunstroke
.
All
day
long
the
rivers
of
hot
blood
poured
*NL*
forth
,
until
,
with
the
sun
beating
down
,
and
the
air
motionless
,
*NL*
the
stench
was
enough
to
knock
a
man
over
;
all
the
old
smells
of
a
*NL*
generation
would
be
drawn
out
by
this
heat
--
for
there
was
never
any
*NL*
washing
of
the
walls
and
rafters
and
pillars
,
and
they
were
caked
with
*NL*
the
filth
of
a
lifetime
.
The
men
who
worked
on
the
killing
beds
would
*NL*
come
to
reek
with
foulness
,
so
that
you
could
smell
one
of
them
fifty
*NL*
feet
away
;
there
was
simply
no
such
thing
as
keeping
decent
,
the
most
*NL*
careful
man
gave
it
up
in
the
end
,
and
wallowed
in
uncleanness
.
There
*NL*
was
not
even
a
place
where
a
man
could
wash
his
hands
,
and
the
men
ate
*NL*
as
much
raw
blood
as
food
at
dinnertime
.
When
they
were
at
work
they
*NL*
could
not
even
wipe
off
their
faces
--
they
were
as
helpless
as
newly
born
*NL*
babes
in
that
respect
;
and
it
may
seem
like
a
small
matter
,
but
when
the
*NL*
sweat
began
to
run
down
their
necks
and
tickle
them
,
or
a
fly
to
bother
*NL*
them
,
it
was
a
torture
like
being
burned
alive
.
Whether
it
was
the
*NL*
slaughterhouses
or
the
dumps
that
were
responsible
,
one
could
not
say
,
*NL*
but
with
the
hot
weather
there
descended
upon
Packingtown
a
veritable
*NL*
Egyptian
plague
of
flies
;
there
could
be
no
describing
this
--
the
houses
*NL*
would
be
black
with
them
.
There
was
no
escaping
;
you
might
provide
all
*NL*
your
doors
and
windows
with
screens
,
but
their
buzzing
outside
would
be
*NL*
like
the
swarming
of
bees
,
and
whenever
you
opened
the
door
they
would
*NL*
rush
in
as
if
a
storm
of
wind
were
driving
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
the
summertime
suggests
to
you
thoughts
of
the
country
,
visions
*NL*
of
green
fields
and
mountains
and
sparkling
lakes
.
It
had
no
such
*NL*
suggestion
for
the
people
in
the
yards
.
The
great
packing
machine
ground
*NL*
on
remorselessly
,
without
thinking
of
green
fields
;
and
the
men
and
*NL*
women
and
children
who
were
part
of
it
never
saw
any
green
thing
,
not
*NL*
even
a
flower
.
Four
or
five
miles
to
the
east
of
them
lay
the
blue
*NL*
waters
of
Lake
Michigan
;
but
for
all
the
good
it
did
them
it
might
have
*NL*
been
as
far
away
as
the
Pacific
Ocean
.
They
had
only
Sundays
,
and
*NL*
then
they
were
too
tired
to
walk
.
They
were
tied
to
the
great
packing
*NL*
machine
,
and
tied
to
it
for
life
.
The
managers
and
superintendents
and
*NL*
clerks
of
Packingtown
were
all
recruited
from
another
class
,
and
never
*NL*
from
the
workers
;
they
scorned
the
workers
,
the
very
meanest
of
them
.
A
*NL*
poor
devil
of
a
bookkeeper
who
had
been
working
in
Durham
's
for
twenty
*NL*
years
at
a
salary
of
six
dollars
a
week
,
and
might
work
there
for
twenty
*NL*
more
and
do
no
better
,
would
yet
consider
himself
a
gentleman
,
as
far
*NL*
removed
as
the
poles
from
the
most
skilled
worker
on
the
killing
beds
;
*NL*
he
would
dress
differently
,
and
live
in
another
part
of
the
town
,
and
*NL*
come
to
work
at
a
different
hour
of
the
day
,
and
in
every
way
make
sure
*NL*
that
he
never
rubbed
elbows
with
a
laboring
man
.
Perhaps
this
was
due
to
*NL*
the
repulsiveness
of
the
work
;
at
any
rate
,
the
people
who
worked
with
*NL*
their
hands
were
a
class
apart
,
and
were
made
to
feel
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
late
spring
the
canning
factory
started
up
again
,
and
so
once
*NL*
more
Marija
was
heard
to
sing
,
and
the
love-music
of
Tamoszius
took
on
*NL*
a
less
melancholy
tone
.
It
was
not
for
long
,
however
;
for
a
month
or
two
*NL*
later
a
dreadful
calamity
fell
upon
Marija
.
Just
one
year
and
three
days
*NL*
after
she
had
begun
work
as
a
can-painter
,
she
lost
her
job
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
long
story
.
Marija
insisted
that
it
was
because
of
her
activity
*NL*
in
the
union
.
The
packers
,
of
course
,
had
spies
in
all
the
unions
,
and
*NL*
in
addition
they
made
a
practice
of
buying
up
a
certain
number
of
the
*NL*
union
officials
,
as
many
as
they
thought
they
needed
.
So
every
week
they
*NL*
received
reports
as
to
what
was
going
on
,
and
often
they
knew
things
*NL*
before
the
members
of
the
union
knew
them
.
Any
one
who
was
considered
*NL*
to
be
dangerous
by
them
would
find
that
he
was
not
a
favorite
with
*NL*
his
boss
;
and
Marija
had
been
a
great
hand
for
going
after
the
foreign
*NL*
people
and
preaching
to
them
.
However
that
might
be
,
the
known
facts
*NL*
were
that
a
few
weeks
before
the
factory
closed
,
Marija
had
been
cheated
*NL*
out
of
her
pay
for
three
hundred
cans
.
The
girls
worked
at
a
long
table
,
*NL*
and
behind
them
walked
a
woman
with
pencil
and
notebook
,
keeping
count
*NL*
of
the
number
they
finished
.
This
woman
was
,
of
course
,
only
human
,
and
*NL*
sometimes
made
mistakes
;
when
this
happened
,
there
was
no
redress
--
if
*NL*
on
Saturday
you
got
less
money
than
you
had
earned
,
you
had
to
make
the
*NL*
best
of
it
.
But
Marija
did
not
understand
this
,
and
made
a
disturbance
.
*NL*
Marija
's
disturbances
did
not
mean
anything
,
and
while
she
had
known
*NL*
only
Lithuanian
and
Polish
,
they
had
done
no
harm
,
for
people
only
*NL*
laughed
at
her
and
made
her
cry
.
But
now
Marija
was
able
to
call
names
*NL*
in
English
,
and
so
she
got
the
woman
who
made
the
mistake
to
disliking
*NL*
her
.
Probably
,
as
Marija
claimed
,
she
made
mistakes
on
purpose
after
*NL*
that
;
at
any
rate
,
she
made
them
,
and
the
third
time
it
happened
Marija
*NL*
went
on
the
warpath
and
took
the
matter
first
to
the
forelady
,
and
*NL*
when
she
got
no
satisfaction
there
,
to
the
superintendent
.
This
was
*NL*
unheard-of
presumption
,
but
the
superintendent
said
he
would
see
about
*NL*
it
,
which
Marija
took
to
mean
that
she
was
going
to
get
her
money
;
after
*NL*
waiting
three
days
,
she
went
to
see
the
superintendent
again
.
This
time
*NL*
the
man
frowned
,
and
said
that
he
had
not
had
time
to
attend
to
it
;
and
*NL*
when
Marija
,
against
the
advice
and
warning
of
every
one
,
tried
it
once
*NL*
more
,
he
ordered
her
back
to
her
work
in
a
passion
.
Just
how
things
*NL*
happened
after
that
Marija
was
not
sure
,
but
that
afternoon
the
forelady
*NL*
told
her
that
her
services
would
not
be
any
longer
required
.
Poor
Marija
*NL*
could
not
have
been
more
dumfounded
had
the
woman
knocked
her
over
the
*NL*
head
;
at
first
she
could
not
believe
what
she
heard
,
and
then
she
grew
*NL*
furious
and
swore
that
she
would
come
anyway
,
that
her
place
belonged
*NL*
to
her
.
In
the
end
she
sat
down
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
wept
and
*NL*
wailed
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
cruel
lesson
;
but
then
Marija
was
headstrong
--
she
should
have
*NL*
listened
to
those
who
had
had
experience
.
The
next
time
she
would
know
*NL*
her
place
,
as
the
forelady
expressed
it
;
and
so
Marija
went
out
,
and
the
*NL*
family
faced
the
problem
of
an
existence
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
especially
hard
this
time
,
for
Ona
was
to
be
confined
before
*NL*
long
,
and
Jurgis
was
trying
hard
to
save
up
money
for
this
.
He
had
*NL*
heard
dreadful
stories
of
the
midwives
,
who
grow
as
thick
as
fleas
*NL*
in
Packingtown
;
and
he
had
made
up
his
mind
that
Ona
must
have
a
*NL*
man-doctor
.
Jurgis
could
be
very
obstinate
when
he
wanted
to
,
and
he
*NL*
was
in
this
case
,
much
to
the
dismay
of
the
women
,
who
felt
that
a
*NL*
man-doctor
was
an
impropriety
,
and
that
the
matter
really
belonged
to
*NL*
them
.
The
cheapest
doctor
they
could
find
would
charge
them
fifteen
*NL*
dollars
,
and
perhaps
more
when
the
bill
came
in
;
and
here
was
Jurgis
,
*NL*
declaring
that
he
would
pay
it
,
even
if
he
had
to
stop
eating
in
the
*NL*
meantime
!
*NL*
*NL*
Marija
had
only
about
twenty-five
dollars
left
.
Day
after
day
she
*NL*
wandered
about
the
yards
begging
a
job
,
but
this
time
without
hope
of
*NL*
finding
it
.
Marija
could
do
the
work
of
an
able-bodied
man
,
when
she
*NL*
was
cheerful
,
but
discouragement
wore
her
out
easily
,
and
she
would
come
*NL*
home
at
night
a
pitiable
object
.
She
learned
her
lesson
this
time
,
poor
*NL*
creature
;
she
learned
it
ten
times
over
.
All
the
family
learned
it
along
*NL*
with
her
--
that
when
you
have
once
got
a
job
in
Packingtown
,
you
hang
on
*NL*
to
it
,
come
what
will
.
*NL*
*NL*
Four
weeks
Marija
hunted
,
and
half
of
a
fifth
week
.
Of
course
she
*NL*
stopped
paying
her
dues
to
the
union
.
She
lost
all
interest
in
the
*NL*
union
,
and
cursed
herself
for
a
fool
that
she
had
ever
been
dragged
*NL*
into
one
.
She
had
about
made
up
her
mind
that
she
was
a
lost
soul
,
*NL*
when
somebody
told
her
of
an
opening
,
and
she
went
and
got
a
place
as
*NL*
a
``
beef-trimmer
.
''
She
got
this
because
the
boss
saw
that
she
had
the
*NL*
muscles
of
a
man
,
and
so
he
discharged
a
man
and
put
Marija
to
do
his
*NL*
work
,
paying
her
a
little
more
than
half
what
he
had
been
paying
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
first
came
to
Packingtown
,
Marija
would
have
scorned
such
work
*NL*
as
this
.
She
was
in
another
canning
factory
,
and
her
work
was
to
trim
*NL*
the
meat
of
those
diseased
cattle
that
Jurgis
had
been
told
about
not
*NL*
long
before
.
She
was
shut
up
in
one
of
the
rooms
where
the
people
seldom
*NL*
saw
the
daylight
;
beneath
her
were
the
chilling
rooms
,
where
the
meat
*NL*
was
frozen
,
and
above
her
were
the
cooking
rooms
;
and
so
she
stood
on
an
*NL*
ice-cold
floor
,
while
her
head
was
often
so
hot
that
she
could
scarcely
*NL*
breathe
.
Trimming
beef
off
the
bones
by
the
hundred-weight
,
while
*NL*
standing
up
from
early
morning
till
late
at
night
,
with
heavy
boots
on
*NL*
and
the
floor
always
damp
and
full
of
puddles
,
liable
to
be
thrown
out
*NL*
of
work
indefinitely
because
of
a
slackening
in
the
trade
,
liable
again
*NL*
to
be
kept
overtime
in
rush
seasons
,
and
be
worked
till
she
trembled
*NL*
in
every
nerve
and
lost
her
grip
on
her
slimy
knife
,
and
gave
herself
*NL*
a
poisoned
wound
--
that
was
the
new
life
that
unfolded
itself
before
*NL*
Marija
.
But
because
Marija
was
a
human
horse
she
merely
laughed
and
went
*NL*
at
it
;
it
would
enable
her
to
pay
her
board
again
,
and
keep
the
family
*NL*
going
.
And
as
for
Tamoszius
--
well
,
they
had
waited
a
long
time
,
and
they
*NL*
could
wait
a
little
longer
.
They
could
not
possibly
get
along
upon
his
*NL*
wages
alone
,
and
the
family
could
not
live
without
hers
.
He
could
come
*NL*
and
visit
her
,
and
sit
in
the
kitchen
and
hold
her
hand
,
and
he
must
*NL*
manage
to
be
content
with
that
.
But
day
by
day
the
music
of
Tamoszius
'
*NL*
violin
became
more
passionate
and
heartbreaking
;
and
Marija
would
sit
*NL*
with
her
hands
clasped
and
her
cheeks
wet
and
all
her
body
a-tremble
,
*NL*
hearing
in
the
wailing
melodies
the
voices
of
the
unborn
generations
*NL*
which
cried
out
in
her
for
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Marija
's
lesson
came
just
in
time
to
save
Ona
from
a
similar
fate
.
*NL*
Ona
,
too
,
was
dissatisfied
with
her
place
,
and
had
far
more
reason
than
*NL*
Marija
.
She
did
not
tell
half
of
her
story
at
home
,
because
she
saw
it
*NL*
was
a
torment
to
Jurgis
,
and
she
was
afraid
of
what
he
might
do
.
For
*NL*
a
long
time
Ona
had
seen
that
Miss
Henderson
,
the
forelady
in
her
*NL*
department
,
did
not
like
her
.
At
first
she
thought
it
was
the
old-time
*NL*
mistake
she
had
made
in
asking
for
a
holiday
to
get
married
.
Then
she
*NL*
concluded
it
must
be
because
she
did
not
give
the
forelady
a
present
*NL*
occasionally
--
she
was
the
kind
that
took
presents
from
the
girls
,
Ona
*NL*
learned
,
and
made
all
sorts
of
discriminations
in
favor
of
those
who
*NL*
gave
them
.
In
the
end
,
however
,
Ona
discovered
that
it
was
even
worse
*NL*
than
that
.
Miss
Henderson
was
a
newcomer
,
and
it
was
some
time
before
*NL*
rumor
made
her
out
;
but
finally
it
transpired
that
she
was
a
kept
woman
,
*NL*
the
former
mistress
of
the
superintendent
of
a
department
in
the
same
*NL*
building
.
He
had
put
her
there
to
keep
her
quiet
,
it
seemed
--
and
that
*NL*
not
altogether
with
success
,
for
once
or
twice
they
had
been
heard
*NL*
quarreling
.
She
had
the
temper
of
a
hyena
,
and
soon
the
place
she
ran
*NL*
was
a
witch
's
caldron
.
There
were
some
of
the
girls
who
were
of
her
own
*NL*
sort
,
who
were
willing
to
toady
to
her
and
flatter
her
;
and
these
would
*NL*
carry
tales
about
the
rest
,
and
so
the
furies
were
unchained
in
the
*NL*
place
.
Worse
than
this
,
the
woman
lived
in
a
bawdy-house
downtown
,
with
*NL*
a
coarse
,
red-faced
Irishman
named
Connor
,
who
was
the
boss
of
the
*NL*
loading-gang
outside
,
and
would
make
free
with
the
girls
as
they
went
*NL*
to
and
from
their
work
.
In
the
slack
seasons
some
of
them
would
go
with
*NL*
Miss
Henderson
to
this
house
downtown
--
in
fact
,
it
would
not
be
too
much
*NL*
to
say
that
she
managed
her
department
at
Brown
's
in
conjunction
with
*NL*
it
.
Sometimes
women
from
the
house
would
be
given
places
alongside
of
*NL*
decent
girls
,
and
after
other
decent
girls
had
been
turned
off
to
make
*NL*
room
for
them
.
When
you
worked
in
this
woman
's
department
the
house
*NL*
downtown
was
never
out
of
your
thoughts
all
day
--
there
were
always
*NL*
whiffs
of
it
to
be
caught
,
like
the
odor
of
the
Packingtown
rendering
*NL*
plants
at
night
,
when
the
wind
shifted
suddenly
.
There
would
be
stories
*NL*
about
it
going
the
rounds
;
the
girls
opposite
you
would
be
telling
them
*NL*
and
winking
at
you
.
In
such
a
place
Ona
would
not
have
stayed
a
day
,
but
*NL*
for
starvation
;
and
,
as
it
was
,
she
was
never
sure
that
she
could
*NL*
stay
the
next
day
.
She
understood
now
that
the
real
reason
that
Miss
*NL*
Henderson
hated
her
was
that
she
was
a
decent
married
girl
;
and
she
knew
*NL*
that
the
talebearers
and
the
toadies
hated
her
for
the
same
reason
,
and
*NL*
were
doing
their
best
to
make
her
life
miserable
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
was
no
place
a
girl
could
go
in
Packingtown
,
if
she
was
*NL*
particular
about
things
of
this
sort
;
there
was
no
place
in
it
where
*NL*
a
prostitute
could
not
get
along
better
than
a
decent
girl
.
Here
was
a
*NL*
population
,
low-class
and
mostly
foreign
,
hanging
always
on
the
verge
of
*NL*
starvation
,
and
dependent
for
its
opportunities
of
life
upon
the
whim
of
*NL*
men
every
bit
as
brutal
and
unscrupulous
as
the
old-time
slave
drivers
;
*NL*
under
such
circumstances
immorality
was
exactly
as
inevitable
,
and
as
*NL*
prevalent
,
as
it
was
under
the
system
of
chattel
slavery
.
Things
that
*NL*
were
quite
unspeakable
went
on
there
in
the
packing
houses
all
the
time
,
*NL*
and
were
taken
for
granted
by
everybody
;
only
they
did
not
show
,
as
in
*NL*
the
old
slavery
times
,
because
there
was
no
difference
in
color
between
*NL*
master
and
slave
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
Ona
stayed
home
,
and
Jurgis
had
the
man-doctor
,
according
*NL*
to
his
whim
,
and
she
was
safely
delivered
of
a
fine
baby
.
It
was
an
*NL*
enormous
big
boy
,
and
Ona
was
such
a
tiny
creature
herself
,
that
it
*NL*
seemed
quite
incredible
.
Jurgis
would
stand
and
gaze
at
the
stranger
by
*NL*
the
hour
,
unable
to
believe
that
it
had
really
happened
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
coming
of
this
boy
was
a
decisive
event
with
Jurgis
.
It
made
him
*NL*
irrevocably
a
family
man
;
it
killed
the
last
lingering
impulse
that
he
*NL*
might
have
had
to
go
out
in
the
evenings
and
sit
and
talk
with
the
men
*NL*
in
the
saloons
.
There
was
nothing
he
cared
for
now
so
much
as
to
sit
*NL*
and
look
at
the
baby
.
This
was
very
curious
,
for
Jurgis
had
never
been
*NL*
interested
in
babies
before
.
But
then
,
this
was
a
very
unusual
sort
of
a
*NL*
baby
.
He
had
the
brightest
little
black
eyes
,
and
little
black
ringlets
*NL*
all
over
his
head
;
he
was
the
living
image
of
his
father
,
everybody
*NL*
said
--
and
Jurgis
found
this
a
fascinating
circumstance
.
It
was
*NL*
sufficiently
perplexing
that
this
tiny
mite
of
life
should
have
come
*NL*
into
the
world
at
all
in
the
manner
that
it
had
;
that
it
should
have
*NL*
come
with
a
comical
imitation
of
its
father
's
nose
was
simply
uncanny
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
,
Jurgis
thought
,
this
was
intended
to
signify
that
it
was
his
*NL*
baby
;
that
it
was
his
and
Ona
's
,
to
care
for
all
its
life
.
Jurgis
had
*NL*
never
possessed
anything
nearly
so
interesting
--
a
baby
was
,
when
you
*NL*
came
to
think
about
it
,
assuredly
a
marvelous
possession
.
It
would
grow
*NL*
up
to
be
a
man
,
a
human
soul
,
with
a
personality
all
its
own
,
a
will
of
*NL*
its
own
!
Such
thoughts
would
keep
haunting
Jurgis
,
filling
him
with
*NL*
all
sorts
of
strange
and
almost
painful
excitements
.
He
was
wonderfully
*NL*
proud
of
little
Antanas
;
he
was
curious
about
all
the
details
of
*NL*
him
--
the
washing
and
the
dressing
and
the
eating
and
the
sleeping
of
*NL*
him
,
and
asked
all
sorts
of
absurd
questions
.
It
took
him
quite
a
*NL*
while
to
get
over
his
alarm
at
the
incredible
shortness
of
the
little
*NL*
creature
's
legs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
had
,
alas
,
very
little
time
to
see
his
baby
;
he
never
felt
the
*NL*
chains
about
him
more
than
just
then
.
When
he
came
home
at
night
,
the
*NL*
baby
would
be
asleep
,
and
it
would
be
the
merest
chance
if
he
awoke
*NL*
before
Jurgis
had
to
go
to
sleep
himself
.
Then
in
the
morning
there
was
*NL*
no
time
to
look
at
him
,
so
really
the
only
chance
the
father
had
was
on
*NL*
Sundays
.
This
was
more
cruel
yet
for
Ona
,
who
ought
to
have
stayed
*NL*
home
and
nursed
him
,
the
doctor
said
,
for
her
own
health
as
well
as
the
*NL*
baby
's
;
but
Ona
had
to
go
to
work
,
and
leave
him
for
Teta
Elzbieta
*NL*
to
feed
upon
the
pale
blue
poison
that
was
called
milk
at
the
corner
*NL*
grocery
.
Ona
's
confinement
lost
her
only
a
week
's
wages
--
she
would
go
to
*NL*
the
factory
the
second
Monday
,
and
the
best
that
Jurgis
could
persuade
*NL*
her
was
to
ride
in
the
car
,
and
let
him
run
along
behind
and
help
her
to
*NL*
Brown
's
when
she
alighted
.
After
that
it
would
be
all
right
,
said
Ona
,
*NL*
it
was
no
strain
sitting
still
sewing
hams
all
day
;
and
if
she
waited
*NL*
longer
she
might
find
that
her
dreadful
forelady
had
put
some
one
*NL*
else
in
her
place
.
That
would
be
a
greater
calamity
than
ever
now
,
Ona
*NL*
continued
,
on
account
of
the
baby
.
They
would
all
have
to
work
harder
*NL*
now
on
his
account
.
It
was
such
a
responsibility
--
they
must
not
have
the
*NL*
baby
grow
up
to
suffer
as
they
had
.
And
this
indeed
had
been
the
first
*NL*
thing
that
Jurgis
had
thought
of
himself
--
he
had
clenched
his
hands
and
*NL*
braced
himself
anew
for
the
struggle
,
for
the
sake
of
that
tiny
mite
of
*NL*
human
possibility
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
Ona
went
back
to
Brown
's
and
saved
her
place
and
a
week
's
wages
;
*NL*
and
so
she
gave
herself
some
one
of
the
thousand
ailments
that
women
*NL*
group
under
the
title
of
``
womb
trouble
,
''
and
was
never
again
a
well
*NL*
person
as
long
as
she
lived
.
It
is
difficult
to
convey
in
words
all
that
*NL*
this
meant
to
Ona
;
it
seemed
such
a
slight
offense
,
and
the
punishment
*NL*
was
so
out
of
all
proportion
,
that
neither
she
nor
any
one
else
ever
*NL*
connected
the
two
.
``
Womb
trouble
''
to
Ona
did
not
mean
a
specialist
's
*NL*
diagnosis
,
and
a
course
of
treatment
,
and
perhaps
an
operation
or
two
;
*NL*
it
meant
simply
headaches
and
pains
in
the
back
,
and
depression
and
*NL*
heartsickness
,
and
neuralgia
when
she
had
to
go
to
work
in
the
rain
.
The
*NL*
great
majority
of
the
women
who
worked
in
Packingtown
suffered
in
the
*NL*
same
way
,
and
from
the
same
cause
,
so
it
was
not
deemed
a
thing
to
see
*NL*
the
doctor
about
;
instead
Ona
would
try
patent
medicines
,
one
after
*NL*
another
,
as
her
friends
told
her
about
them
.
As
these
all
contained
*NL*
alcohol
,
or
some
other
stimulant
,
she
found
that
they
all
did
her
good
*NL*
while
she
took
them
;
and
so
she
was
always
chasing
the
phantom
of
good
*NL*
health
,
and
losing
it
because
she
was
too
poor
to
continue
.

Chapter
11
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
summer
the
packing
houses
were
in
full
activity
again
,
and
*NL*
Jurgis
made
more
money
.
He
did
not
make
so
much
,
however
,
as
he
had
the
*NL*
previous
summer
,
for
the
packers
took
on
more
hands
.
There
were
new
men
*NL*
every
week
,
it
seemed
--
it
was
a
regular
system
;
and
this
number
they
*NL*
would
keep
over
to
the
next
slack
season
,
so
that
every
one
would
have
*NL*
less
than
ever
.
Sooner
or
later
,
by
this
plan
,
they
would
have
all
the
*NL*
floating
labor
of
Chicago
trained
to
do
their
work
.
And
how
very
cunning
*NL*
a
trick
was
that
!
The
men
were
to
teach
new
hands
,
who
would
some
day
*NL*
come
and
break
their
strike
;
and
meantime
they
were
kept
so
poor
that
*NL*
they
could
not
prepare
for
the
trial
!
*NL*
*NL*
But
let
no
one
suppose
that
this
superfluity
of
employees
meant
easier
*NL*
work
for
any
one
!
On
the
contrary
,
the
speeding-up
seemed
to
be
growing
*NL*
more
savage
all
the
time
;
they
were
continually
inventing
new
devices
to
*NL*
crowd
the
work
on
--
it
was
for
all
the
world
like
the
thumbscrew
of
the
*NL*
medieval
torture
chamber
.
They
would
get
new
pacemakers
and
pay
them
*NL*
more
;
they
would
drive
the
men
on
with
new
machinery
--
it
was
said
*NL*
that
in
the
hog-killing
rooms
the
speed
at
which
the
hogs
moved
was
*NL*
determined
by
clockwork
,
and
that
it
was
increased
a
little
every
day
.
*NL*
In
piecework
they
would
reduce
the
time
,
requiring
the
same
work
in
a
*NL*
shorter
time
,
and
paying
the
same
wages
;
and
then
,
after
the
workers
had
*NL*
accustomed
themselves
to
this
new
speed
,
they
would
reduce
the
rate
of
*NL*
payment
to
correspond
with
the
reduction
in
time
!
They
had
done
this
*NL*
so
often
in
the
canning
establishments
that
the
girls
were
fairly
*NL*
desperate
;
their
wages
had
gone
down
by
a
full
third
in
the
past
two
*NL*
years
,
and
a
storm
of
discontent
was
brewing
that
was
likely
to
break
*NL*
any
day
.
Only
a
month
after
Marija
had
become
a
beef-trimmer
the
canning
*NL*
factory
that
she
had
left
posted
a
cut
that
would
divide
the
girls
'
*NL*
earnings
almost
squarely
in
half
;
and
so
great
was
the
indignation
at
*NL*
this
that
they
marched
out
without
even
a
parley
,
and
organized
in
the
*NL*
street
outside
.
One
of
the
girls
had
read
somewhere
that
a
red
flag
was
*NL*
the
proper
symbol
for
oppressed
workers
,
and
so
they
mounted
one
,
and
*NL*
paraded
all
about
the
yards
,
yelling
with
rage
.
A
new
union
was
the
*NL*
result
of
this
outburst
,
but
the
impromptu
strike
went
to
pieces
in
*NL*
three
days
,
owing
to
the
rush
of
new
labor
.
At
the
end
of
it
the
girl
*NL*
who
had
carried
the
red
flag
went
downtown
and
got
a
position
in
a
great
*NL*
department
store
,
at
a
salary
of
two
dollars
and
a
half
a
week
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
and
Ona
heard
these
stories
with
dismay
,
for
there
was
no
telling
*NL*
when
their
own
time
might
come
.
Once
or
twice
there
had
been
rumors
*NL*
that
one
of
the
big
houses
was
going
to
cut
its
unskilled
men
to
fifteen
*NL*
cents
an
hour
,
and
Jurgis
knew
that
if
this
was
done
,
his
turn
would
*NL*
come
soon
.
He
had
learned
by
this
time
that
Packingtown
was
really
not
*NL*
a
number
of
firms
at
all
,
but
one
great
firm
,
the
Beef
Trust
.
And
every
*NL*
week
the
managers
of
it
got
together
and
compared
notes
,
and
there
*NL*
was
one
scale
for
all
the
workers
in
the
yards
and
one
standard
of
*NL*
efficiency
.
Jurgis
was
told
that
they
also
fixed
the
price
they
would
*NL*
pay
for
beef
on
the
hoof
and
the
price
of
all
dressed
meat
in
the
*NL*
country
;
but
that
was
something
he
did
not
understand
or
care
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
only
one
who
was
not
afraid
of
a
cut
was
Marija
,
who
congratulated
*NL*
herself
,
somewhat
naively
,
that
there
had
been
one
in
her
place
only
*NL*
a
short
time
before
she
came
.
Marija
was
getting
to
be
a
skilled
*NL*
beef-trimmer
,
and
was
mounting
to
the
heights
again
.
During
the
summer
*NL*
and
fall
Jurgis
and
Ona
managed
to
pay
her
back
the
last
penny
they
*NL*
owed
her
,
and
so
she
began
to
have
a
bank
account
.
Tamoszius
had
a
bank
*NL*
account
also
,
and
they
ran
a
race
,
and
began
to
figure
upon
household
*NL*
expenses
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
possession
of
vast
wealth
entails
cares
and
responsibilities
,
*NL*
however
,
as
poor
Marija
found
out
.
She
had
taken
the
advice
of
a
friend
*NL*
and
invested
her
savings
in
a
bank
on
Ashland
Avenue
.
Of
course
she
knew
*NL*
nothing
about
it
,
except
that
it
was
big
and
imposing
--
what
possible
*NL*
chance
has
a
poor
foreign
working
girl
to
understand
the
banking
*NL*
business
,
as
it
is
conducted
in
this
land
of
frenzied
finance
?
So
Marija
*NL*
lived
in
a
continual
dread
lest
something
should
happen
to
her
bank
,
and
*NL*
would
go
out
of
her
way
mornings
to
make
sure
that
it
was
still
there
.
*NL*
Her
principal
thought
was
of
fire
,
for
she
had
deposited
her
money
in
*NL*
bills
,
and
was
afraid
that
if
they
were
burned
up
the
bank
would
not
*NL*
give
her
any
others
.
Jurgis
made
fun
of
her
for
this
,
for
he
was
a
man
*NL*
and
was
proud
of
his
superior
knowledge
,
telling
her
that
the
bank
had
*NL*
fireproof
vaults
,
and
all
its
millions
of
dollars
hidden
safely
away
in
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
one
morning
Marija
took
her
usual
detour
,
and
,
to
her
horror
*NL*
and
dismay
,
saw
a
crowd
of
people
in
front
of
the
bank
,
filling
the
*NL*
avenue
solid
for
half
a
block
.
All
the
blood
went
out
of
her
face
for
*NL*
terror
.
She
broke
into
a
run
,
shouting
to
the
people
to
ask
what
was
the
*NL*
matter
,
but
not
stopping
to
hear
what
they
answered
,
till
she
had
come
*NL*
to
where
the
throng
was
so
dense
that
she
could
no
longer
advance
.
There
*NL*
was
a
``
run
on
the
bank
,
''
they
told
her
then
,
but
she
did
not
know
what
*NL*
that
was
,
and
turned
from
one
person
to
another
,
trying
in
an
agony
*NL*
of
fear
to
make
out
what
they
meant
.
Had
something
gone
wrong
with
the
*NL*
bank
?
Nobody
was
sure
,
but
they
thought
so
.
Could
n't
she
get
her
money
?
*NL*
There
was
no
telling
;
the
people
were
afraid
not
,
and
they
were
all
*NL*
trying
to
get
it
.
It
was
too
early
yet
to
tell
anything
--
the
bank
would
*NL*
not
open
for
nearly
three
hours
.
So
in
a
frenzy
of
despair
Marija
began
*NL*
to
claw
her
way
toward
the
doors
of
this
building
,
through
a
throng
of
*NL*
men
,
women
,
and
children
,
all
as
excited
as
herself
.
It
was
a
scene
of
*NL*
wild
confusion
,
women
shrieking
and
wringing
their
hands
and
fainting
,
*NL*
and
men
fighting
and
trampling
down
everything
in
their
way
.
In
*NL*
the
midst
of
the
melee
Marija
recollected
that
she
did
not
have
her
*NL*
bankbook
,
and
could
not
get
her
money
anyway
,
so
she
fought
her
way
out
*NL*
and
started
on
a
run
for
home
.
This
was
fortunate
for
her
,
for
a
few
*NL*
minutes
later
the
police
reserves
arrived
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
half
an
hour
Marija
was
back
,
Teta
Elzbieta
with
her
,
both
of
them
*NL*
breathless
with
running
and
sick
with
fear
.
The
crowd
was
now
formed
*NL*
in
a
line
,
extending
for
several
blocks
,
with
half
a
hundred
policemen
*NL*
keeping
guard
,
and
so
there
was
nothing
for
them
to
do
but
to
take
their
*NL*
places
at
the
end
of
it
.
At
nine
o'clock
the
bank
opened
and
began
to
*NL*
pay
the
waiting
throng
;
but
then
,
what
good
did
that
do
Marija
,
who
saw
*NL*
three
thousand
people
before
her
--
enough
to
take
out
the
last
penny
of
a
*NL*
dozen
banks
?
*NL*
*NL*
To
make
matters
worse
a
drizzling
rain
came
up
,
and
soaked
them
to
the
*NL*
skin
;
yet
all
the
morning
they
stood
there
,
creeping
slowly
toward
the
*NL*
goal
--
all
the
afternoon
they
stood
there
,
heartsick
,
seeing
that
the
*NL*
hour
of
closing
was
coming
,
and
that
they
were
going
to
be
left
out
.
*NL*
Marija
made
up
her
mind
that
,
come
what
might
,
she
would
stay
there
and
*NL*
keep
her
place
;
but
as
nearly
all
did
the
same
,
all
through
the
long
,
*NL*
cold
night
,
she
got
very
little
closer
to
the
bank
for
that
.
Toward
*NL*
evening
Jurgis
came
;
he
had
heard
the
story
from
the
children
,
and
he
*NL*
brought
some
food
and
dry
wraps
,
which
made
it
a
little
easier
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
,
before
daybreak
,
came
a
bigger
crowd
than
ever
,
and
*NL*
more
policemen
from
downtown
.
Marija
held
on
like
grim
death
,
and
toward
*NL*
afternoon
she
got
into
the
bank
and
got
her
money
--
all
in
big
silver
*NL*
dollars
,
a
handkerchief
full
.
When
she
had
once
got
her
hands
on
them
*NL*
her
fear
vanished
,
and
she
wanted
to
put
them
back
again
;
but
the
man
*NL*
at
the
window
was
savage
,
and
said
that
the
bank
would
receive
no
more
*NL*
deposits
from
those
who
had
taken
part
in
the
run
.
So
Marija
was
forced
*NL*
to
take
her
dollars
home
with
her
,
watching
to
right
and
left
,
expecting
*NL*
every
instant
that
some
one
would
try
to
rob
her
;
and
when
she
got
home
*NL*
she
was
not
much
better
off
.
Until
she
could
find
another
bank
there
was
*NL*
nothing
to
do
but
sew
them
up
in
her
clothes
,
and
so
Marija
went
about
*NL*
for
a
week
or
more
,
loaded
down
with
bullion
,
and
afraid
to
cross
the
*NL*
street
in
front
of
the
house
,
because
Jurgis
told
her
she
would
sink
out
*NL*
of
sight
in
the
mud
.
Weighted
this
way
she
made
her
way
to
the
*NL*
yards
,
again
in
fear
,
this
time
to
see
if
she
had
lost
her
place
;
but
*NL*
fortunately
about
ten
per
cent
of
the
working
people
of
Packingtown
had
*NL*
been
depositors
in
that
bank
,
and
it
was
not
convenient
to
discharge
*NL*
that
many
at
once
.
The
cause
of
the
panic
had
been
the
attempt
of
a
*NL*
policeman
to
arrest
a
drunken
man
in
a
saloon
next
door
,
which
had
drawn
*NL*
a
crowd
at
the
hour
the
people
were
on
their
way
to
work
,
and
so
started
*NL*
the
``
run
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
About
this
time
Jurgis
and
Ona
also
began
a
bank
account
.
Besides
having
*NL*
paid
Jonas
and
Marija
,
they
had
almost
paid
for
their
furniture
,
and
*NL*
could
have
that
little
sum
to
count
on
.
So
long
as
each
of
them
could
*NL*
bring
home
nine
or
ten
dollars
a
week
,
they
were
able
to
get
along
*NL*
finely
.
Also
election
day
came
round
again
,
and
Jurgis
made
half
a
*NL*
week
's
wages
out
of
that
,
all
net
profit
.
It
was
a
very
close
election
*NL*
that
year
,
and
the
echoes
of
the
battle
reached
even
to
Packingtown
.
The
*NL*
two
rival
sets
of
grafters
hired
halls
and
set
off
fireworks
and
made
*NL*
speeches
,
to
try
to
get
the
people
interested
in
the
matter
.
Although
*NL*
Jurgis
did
not
understand
it
all
,
he
knew
enough
by
this
time
to
realize
*NL*
that
it
was
not
supposed
to
be
right
to
sell
your
vote
.
However
,
as
*NL*
every
one
did
it
,
and
his
refusal
to
join
would
not
have
made
the
*NL*
slightest
difference
in
the
results
,
the
idea
of
refusing
would
have
*NL*
seemed
absurd
,
had
it
ever
come
into
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Now
chill
winds
and
shortening
days
began
to
warn
them
that
the
winter
*NL*
was
coming
again
.
It
seemed
as
if
the
respite
had
been
too
short
--
they
*NL*
had
not
had
time
enough
to
get
ready
for
it
;
but
still
it
came
,
*NL*
inexorably
,
and
the
hunted
look
began
to
come
back
into
the
eyes
of
*NL*
little
Stanislovas
.
The
prospect
struck
fear
to
the
heart
of
Jurgis
*NL*
also
,
for
he
knew
that
Ona
was
not
fit
to
face
the
cold
and
the
*NL*
snowdrifts
this
year
.
And
suppose
that
some
day
when
a
blizzard
struck
*NL*
them
and
the
cars
were
not
running
,
Ona
should
have
to
give
up
,
and
*NL*
should
come
the
next
day
to
find
that
her
place
had
been
given
to
some
*NL*
one
who
lived
nearer
and
could
be
depended
on
?
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
week
before
Christmas
that
the
first
storm
came
,
and
then
the
*NL*
soul
of
Jurgis
rose
up
within
him
like
a
sleeping
lion
.
There
were
four
*NL*
days
that
the
Ashland
Avenue
cars
were
stalled
,
and
in
those
days
,
*NL*
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
,
Jurgis
knew
what
it
was
to
be
really
*NL*
opposed
.
He
had
faced
difficulties
before
,
but
they
had
been
child
's
*NL*
play
;
now
there
was
a
death
struggle
,
and
all
the
furies
were
unchained
*NL*
within
him
.
The
first
morning
they
set
out
two
hours
before
dawn
,
Ona
*NL*
wrapped
all
in
blankets
and
tossed
upon
his
shoulder
like
a
sack
of
*NL*
meal
,
and
the
little
boy
,
bundled
nearly
out
of
sight
,
hanging
by
*NL*
his
coat-tails
.
There
was
a
raging
blast
beating
in
his
face
,
and
the
*NL*
thermometer
stood
below
zero
;
the
snow
was
never
short
of
his
knees
,
and
*NL*
in
some
of
the
drifts
it
was
nearly
up
to
his
armpits
.
It
would
catch
*NL*
his
feet
and
try
to
trip
him
;
it
would
build
itself
into
a
wall
before
*NL*
him
to
beat
him
back
;
and
he
would
fling
himself
into
it
,
plunging
like
*NL*
a
wounded
buffalo
,
puffing
and
snorting
in
rage
.
So
foot
by
foot
he
*NL*
drove
his
way
,
and
when
at
last
he
came
to
Durham
's
he
was
staggering
*NL*
and
almost
blind
,
and
leaned
against
a
pillar
,
gasping
,
and
thanking
God
*NL*
that
the
cattle
came
late
to
the
killing
beds
that
day
.
In
the
evening
*NL*
the
same
thing
had
to
be
done
again
;
and
because
Jurgis
could
not
tell
*NL*
what
hour
of
the
night
he
would
get
off
,
he
got
a
saloon-keeper
to
let
*NL*
Ona
sit
and
wait
for
him
in
a
corner
.
Once
it
was
eleven
o'clock
at
*NL*
night
,
and
black
as
the
pit
,
but
still
they
got
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
blizzard
knocked
many
a
man
out
,
for
the
crowd
outside
begging
for
*NL*
work
was
never
greater
,
and
the
packers
would
not
wait
long
for
any
*NL*
one
.
When
it
was
over
,
the
soul
of
Jurgis
was
a
song
,
for
he
had
met
*NL*
the
enemy
and
conquered
,
and
felt
himself
the
master
of
his
fate
.
--
So
it
*NL*
might
be
with
some
monarch
of
the
forest
that
has
vanquished
his
foes
in
*NL*
fair
fight
,
and
then
falls
into
some
cowardly
trap
in
the
night-time
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
time
of
peril
on
the
killing
beds
was
when
a
steer
broke
loose
.
*NL*
Sometimes
,
in
the
haste
of
speeding-up
,
they
would
dump
one
of
the
*NL*
animals
out
on
the
floor
before
it
was
fully
stunned
,
and
it
would
get
*NL*
upon
its
feet
and
run
amuck
.
Then
there
would
be
a
yell
of
warning
--
the
*NL*
men
would
drop
everything
and
dash
for
the
nearest
pillar
,
slipping
*NL*
here
and
there
on
the
floor
,
and
tumbling
over
each
other
.
This
was
bad
*NL*
enough
in
the
summer
,
when
a
man
could
see
;
in
wintertime
it
was
enough
*NL*
to
make
your
hair
stand
up
,
for
the
room
would
be
so
full
of
steam
that
*NL*
you
could
not
make
anything
out
five
feet
in
front
of
you
.
To
be
sure
,
*NL*
the
steer
was
generally
blind
and
frantic
,
and
not
especially
bent
on
*NL*
hurting
any
one
;
but
think
of
the
chances
of
running
upon
a
knife
,
while
*NL*
nearly
every
man
had
one
in
his
hand
!
And
then
,
to
cap
the
climax
,
the
*NL*
floor
boss
would
come
rushing
up
with
a
rifle
and
begin
blazing
away
!
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
one
of
these
melees
that
Jurgis
fell
into
his
trap
.
That
is
*NL*
the
only
word
to
describe
it
;
it
was
so
cruel
,
and
so
utterly
not
to
*NL*
be
foreseen
.
At
first
he
hardly
noticed
it
,
it
was
such
a
slight
*NL*
accident
--
simply
that
in
leaping
out
of
the
way
he
turned
his
ankle
.
*NL*
There
was
a
twinge
of
pain
,
but
Jurgis
was
used
to
pain
,
and
did
not
*NL*
coddle
himself
.
When
he
came
to
walk
home
,
however
,
he
realized
that
it
*NL*
was
hurting
him
a
great
deal
;
and
in
the
morning
his
ankle
was
swollen
*NL*
out
nearly
double
its
size
,
and
he
could
not
get
his
foot
into
his
shoe
.
*NL*
Still
,
even
then
,
he
did
nothing
more
than
swear
a
little
,
and
wrapped
*NL*
his
foot
in
old
rags
,
and
hobbled
out
to
take
the
car
.
It
chanced
to
be
*NL*
a
rush
day
at
Durham
's
,
and
all
the
long
morning
he
limped
about
with
*NL*
his
aching
foot
;
by
noontime
the
pain
was
so
great
that
it
made
him
*NL*
faint
,
and
after
a
couple
of
hours
in
the
afternoon
he
was
fairly
*NL*
beaten
,
and
had
to
tell
the
boss
.
They
sent
for
the
company
doctor
,
and
*NL*
he
examined
the
foot
and
told
Jurgis
to
go
home
to
bed
,
adding
that
he
*NL*
had
probably
laid
himself
up
for
months
by
his
folly
.
The
injury
was
not
*NL*
one
that
Durham
and
Company
could
be
held
responsible
for
,
and
so
that
*NL*
was
all
there
was
to
it
,
so
far
as
the
doctor
was
concerned
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
got
home
somehow
,
scarcely
able
to
see
for
the
pain
,
and
with
an
*NL*
awful
terror
in
his
soul
,
Elzbieta
helped
him
into
bed
and
bandaged
*NL*
his
injured
foot
with
cold
water
and
tried
hard
not
to
let
him
see
her
*NL*
dismay
;
when
the
rest
came
home
at
night
she
met
them
outside
and
told
*NL*
them
,
and
they
,
too
,
put
on
a
cheerful
face
,
saying
it
would
only
be
for
*NL*
a
week
or
two
,
and
that
they
would
pull
him
through
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
had
gotten
him
to
sleep
,
however
,
they
sat
by
the
kitchen
fire
*NL*
and
talked
it
over
in
frightened
whispers
.
They
were
in
for
a
siege
,
*NL*
that
was
plainly
to
be
seen
.
Jurgis
had
only
about
sixty
dollars
in
the
*NL*
bank
,
and
the
slack
season
was
upon
them
.
Both
Jonas
and
Marija
might
*NL*
soon
be
earning
no
more
than
enough
to
pay
their
board
,
and
besides
that
*NL*
there
were
only
the
wages
of
Ona
and
the
pittance
of
the
little
boy
.
*NL*
There
was
the
rent
to
pay
,
and
still
some
on
the
furniture
;
there
was
*NL*
the
insurance
just
due
,
and
every
month
there
was
sack
after
sack
*NL*
of
coal
.
It
was
January
,
midwinter
,
an
awful
time
to
have
to
face
*NL*
privation
.
Deep
snows
would
come
again
,
and
who
would
carry
Ona
to
her
*NL*
work
now
?
She
might
lose
her
place
--
she
was
almost
certain
to
lose
it
.
*NL*
And
then
little
Stanislovas
began
to
whimper
--
who
would
take
care
of
*NL*
him
?
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
dreadful
that
an
accident
of
this
sort
,
that
no
man
can
help
,
*NL*
should
have
meant
such
suffering
.
The
bitterness
of
it
was
the
daily
*NL*
food
and
drink
of
Jurgis
.
It
was
of
no
use
for
them
to
try
to
deceive
*NL*
him
;
he
knew
as
much
about
the
situation
as
they
did
,
and
he
knew
that
*NL*
the
family
might
literally
starve
to
death
.
The
worry
of
it
fairly
ate
*NL*
him
up
--
he
began
to
look
haggard
the
first
two
or
three
days
of
it
.
In
*NL*
truth
,
it
was
almost
maddening
for
a
strong
man
like
him
,
a
fighter
,
to
*NL*
have
to
lie
there
helpless
on
his
back
.
It
was
for
all
the
world
the
*NL*
old
story
of
Prometheus
bound
.
As
Jurgis
lay
on
his
bed
,
hour
after
hour
*NL*
there
came
to
him
emotions
that
he
had
never
known
before
.
Before
this
*NL*
he
had
met
life
with
a
welcome
--
it
had
its
trials
,
but
none
that
a
man
*NL*
could
not
face
.
But
now
,
in
the
nighttime
,
when
he
lay
tossing
about
,
*NL*
there
would
come
stalking
into
his
chamber
a
grisly
phantom
,
the
sight
*NL*
of
which
made
his
flesh
curl
and
his
hair
to
bristle
up
.
It
was
like
*NL*
seeing
the
world
fall
away
from
underneath
his
feet
;
like
plunging
down
*NL*
into
a
bottomless
abyss
into
yawning
caverns
of
despair
.
It
might
be
*NL*
true
,
then
,
after
all
,
what
others
had
told
him
about
life
,
that
the
*NL*
best
powers
of
a
man
might
not
be
equal
to
it
!
It
might
be
true
that
,
*NL*
strive
as
he
would
,
toil
as
he
would
,
he
might
fail
,
and
go
down
and
be
*NL*
destroyed
!
The
thought
of
this
was
like
an
icy
hand
at
his
heart
;
the
*NL*
thought
that
here
,
in
this
ghastly
home
of
all
horror
,
he
and
all
those
*NL*
who
were
dear
to
him
might
lie
and
perish
of
starvation
and
cold
,
and
*NL*
there
would
be
no
ear
to
hear
their
cry
,
no
hand
to
help
them
!
It
was
*NL*
true
,
it
was
true
,
--
that
here
in
this
huge
city
,
with
its
stores
of
*NL*
heaped-up
wealth
,
human
creatures
might
be
hunted
down
and
destroyed
by
*NL*
the
wild-beast
powers
of
nature
,
just
as
truly
as
ever
they
were
in
the
*NL*
days
of
the
cave
men
!
*NL*
*NL*
Ona
was
now
making
about
thirty
dollars
a
month
,
and
Stanislovas
about
*NL*
thirteen
.
To
add
to
this
there
was
the
board
of
Jonas
and
Marija
,
*NL*
about
forty-five
dollars
.
Deducting
from
this
the
rent
,
interest
,
*NL*
and
installments
on
the
furniture
,
they
had
left
sixty
dollars
,
and
*NL*
deducting
the
coal
,
they
had
fifty
.
They
did
without
everything
that
*NL*
human
beings
could
do
without
;
they
went
in
old
and
ragged
clothing
,
*NL*
that
left
them
at
the
mercy
of
the
cold
,
and
when
the
children
's
shoes
*NL*
wore
out
,
they
tied
them
up
with
string
.
Half
invalid
as
she
was
,
Ona
*NL*
would
do
herself
harm
by
walking
in
the
rain
and
cold
when
she
ought
*NL*
to
have
ridden
;
they
bought
literally
nothing
but
food
--
and
still
they
*NL*
could
not
keep
alive
on
fifty
dollars
a
month
.
They
might
have
done
it
,
*NL*
if
only
they
could
have
gotten
pure
food
,
and
at
fair
prices
;
or
if
only
*NL*
they
had
known
what
to
get
--
if
they
had
not
been
so
pitifully
ignorant
!
*NL*
But
they
had
come
to
a
new
country
,
where
everything
was
different
,
*NL*
including
the
food
.
They
had
always
been
accustomed
to
eat
a
great
deal
*NL*
of
smoked
sausage
,
and
how
could
they
know
that
what
they
bought
in
*NL*
America
was
not
the
same
--
that
its
color
was
made
by
chemicals
,
and
its
*NL*
smoky
flavor
by
more
chemicals
,
and
that
it
was
full
of
``
potato
flour
''
*NL*
besides
?
Potato
flour
is
the
waste
of
potato
after
the
starch
and
*NL*
alcohol
have
been
extracted
;
it
has
no
more
food
value
than
so
much
*NL*
wood
,
and
as
its
use
as
a
food
adulterant
is
a
penal
offense
in
Europe
,
*NL*
thousands
of
tons
of
it
are
shipped
to
America
every
year
.
It
was
*NL*
amazing
what
quantities
of
food
such
as
this
were
needed
every
day
,
by
*NL*
eleven
hungry
persons
.
A
dollar
sixty-five
a
day
was
simply
not
enough
*NL*
to
feed
them
,
and
there
was
no
use
trying
;
and
so
each
week
they
made
an
*NL*
inroad
upon
the
pitiful
little
bank
account
that
Ona
had
begun
.
Because
*NL*
the
account
was
in
her
name
,
it
was
possible
for
her
to
keep
this
a
*NL*
secret
from
her
husband
,
and
to
keep
the
heartsickness
of
it
for
her
*NL*
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
have
been
better
if
Jurgis
had
been
really
ill
;
if
he
had
not
*NL*
been
able
to
think
.
For
he
had
no
resources
such
as
most
invalids
have
;
*NL*
all
he
could
do
was
to
lie
there
and
toss
about
from
side
to
side
.
Now
*NL*
and
then
he
would
break
into
cursing
,
regardless
of
everything
;
and
now
*NL*
and
then
his
impatience
would
get
the
better
of
him
,
and
he
would
try
to
*NL*
get
up
,
and
poor
Teta
Elzbieta
would
have
to
plead
with
him
in
a
frenzy
.
*NL*
Elzbieta
was
all
alone
with
him
the
greater
part
of
the
time
.
She
would
*NL*
sit
and
smooth
his
forehead
by
the
hour
,
and
talk
to
him
and
try
to
make
*NL*
him
forget
.
Sometimes
it
would
be
too
cold
for
the
children
to
go
to
*NL*
school
,
and
they
would
have
to
play
in
the
kitchen
,
where
Jurgis
was
,
*NL*
because
it
was
the
only
room
that
was
half
warm
.
These
were
dreadful
*NL*
times
,
for
Jurgis
would
get
as
cross
as
any
bear
;
he
was
scarcely
to
*NL*
be
blamed
,
for
he
had
enough
to
worry
him
,
and
it
was
hard
when
he
was
*NL*
trying
to
take
a
nap
to
be
kept
awake
by
noisy
and
peevish
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elzbieta
's
only
resource
in
those
times
was
little
Antanas
;
indeed
,
it
*NL*
would
be
hard
to
say
how
they
could
have
gotten
along
at
all
if
it
had
*NL*
not
been
for
little
Antanas
.
It
was
the
one
consolation
of
Jurgis
'
long
*NL*
imprisonment
that
now
he
had
time
to
look
at
his
baby
.
Teta
Elzbieta
*NL*
would
put
the
clothes-basket
in
which
the
baby
slept
alongside
of
his
*NL*
mattress
,
and
Jurgis
would
lie
upon
one
elbow
and
watch
him
by
the
*NL*
hour
,
imagining
things
.
Then
little
Antanas
would
open
his
eyes
--
he
was
*NL*
beginning
to
take
notice
of
things
now
;
and
he
would
smile
--
how
he
would
*NL*
smile
!
So
Jurgis
would
begin
to
forget
and
be
happy
because
he
was
in
*NL*
a
world
where
there
was
a
thing
so
beautiful
as
the
smile
of
little
*NL*
Antanas
,
and
because
such
a
world
could
not
but
be
good
at
the
heart
of
*NL*
it
.
He
looked
more
like
his
father
every
hour
,
Elzbieta
would
say
,
and
*NL*
said
it
many
times
a
day
,
because
she
saw
that
it
pleased
Jurgis
;
the
*NL*
poor
little
terror-stricken
woman
was
planning
all
day
and
all
night
*NL*
to
soothe
the
prisoned
giant
who
was
intrusted
to
her
care
.
Jurgis
,
who
*NL*
knew
nothing
about
the
age-long
and
everlasting
hypocrisy
of
woman
,
would
*NL*
take
the
bait
and
grin
with
delight
;
and
then
he
would
hold
his
finger
*NL*
in
front
of
little
Antanas
'
eyes
,
and
move
it
this
way
and
that
,
and
*NL*
laugh
with
glee
to
see
the
baby
follow
it
.
There
is
no
pet
quite
so
*NL*
fascinating
as
a
baby
;
he
would
look
into
Jurgis
'
face
with
such
uncanny
*NL*
seriousness
,
and
Jurgis
would
start
and
cry
:
``
Palauk
!
Look
,
Muma
,
he
*NL*
knows
his
papa
!
He
does
,
he
does
!
Tu
mano
szirdele

the
little
rascal
!

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
For
three
weeks
after
his
injury
Jurgis
never
got
up
from
bed
.
It
was
*NL*
a
very
obstinate
sprain
;
the
swelling
would
not
go
down
,
and
the
pain
*NL*
still
continued
.
At
the
end
of
that
time
,
however
,
he
could
contain
*NL*
himself
no
longer
,
and
began
trying
to
walk
a
little
every
day
,
laboring
*NL*
to
persuade
himself
that
he
was
better
.
No
arguments
could
stop
him
,
and
*NL*
three
or
four
days
later
he
declared
that
he
was
going
back
to
work
.
He
*NL*
limped
to
the
cars
and
got
to
Brown
's
,
where
he
found
that
the
boss
had
*NL*
kept
his
place
--
that
is
,
was
willing
to
turn
out
into
the
snow
the
poor
*NL*
devil
he
had
hired
in
the
meantime
.
Every
now
and
then
the
pain
would
*NL*
force
Jurgis
to
stop
work
,
but
he
stuck
it
out
till
nearly
an
hour
*NL*
before
closing
.
Then
he
was
forced
to
acknowledge
that
he
could
not
go
*NL*
on
without
fainting
;
it
almost
broke
his
heart
to
do
it
,
and
he
stood
*NL*
leaning
against
a
pillar
and
weeping
like
a
child
.
Two
of
the
men
had
to
*NL*
help
him
to
the
car
,
and
when
he
got
out
he
had
to
sit
down
and
wait
in
*NL*
the
snow
till
some
one
came
along
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
they
put
him
to
bed
again
,
and
sent
for
the
doctor
,
as
they
ought
to
*NL*
have
done
in
the
beginning
.
It
transpired
that
he
had
twisted
a
tendon
*NL*
out
of
place
,
and
could
never
have
gotten
well
without
attention
.
Then
*NL*
he
gripped
the
sides
of
the
bed
,
and
shut
his
teeth
together
,
and
turned
*NL*
white
with
agony
,
while
the
doctor
pulled
and
wrenched
away
at
his
*NL*
swollen
ankle
.
When
finally
the
doctor
left
,
he
told
him
that
he
would
*NL*
have
to
lie
quiet
for
two
months
,
and
that
if
he
went
to
work
before
*NL*
that
time
he
might
lame
himself
for
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Three
days
later
there
came
another
heavy
snowstorm
,
and
Jonas
and
*NL*
Marija
and
Ona
and
little
Stanislovas
all
set
out
together
,
an
hour
*NL*
before
daybreak
,
to
try
to
get
to
the
yards
.
About
noon
the
last
two
*NL*
came
back
,
the
boy
screaming
with
pain
.
His
fingers
were
all
frosted
,
*NL*
it
seemed
.
They
had
had
to
give
up
trying
to
get
to
the
yards
,
and
had
*NL*
nearly
perished
in
a
drift
.
All
that
they
knew
how
to
do
was
to
hold
the
*NL*
frozen
fingers
near
the
fire
,
and
so
little
Stanislovas
spent
most
of
*NL*
the
day
dancing
about
in
horrible
agony
,
till
Jurgis
flew
into
a
passion
*NL*
of
nervous
rage
and
swore
like
a
madman
,
declaring
that
he
would
*NL*
kill
him
if
he
did
not
stop
.
All
that
day
and
night
the
family
was
*NL*
half-crazed
with
fear
that
Ona
and
the
boy
had
lost
their
places
;
and
in
*NL*
the
morning
they
set
out
earlier
than
ever
,
after
the
little
fellow
had
*NL*
been
beaten
with
a
stick
by
Jurgis
.
There
could
be
no
trifling
in
a
case
*NL*
like
this
,
it
was
a
matter
of
life
and
death
;
little
Stanislovas
could
*NL*
not
be
expected
to
realize
that
he
might
a
great
deal
better
freeze
*NL*
in
the
snowdrift
than
lose
his
job
at
the
lard
machine
.
Ona
was
quite
*NL*
certain
that
she
would
find
her
place
gone
,
and
was
all
unnerved
when
*NL*
she
finally
got
to
Brown
's
,
and
found
that
the
forelady
herself
had
*NL*
failed
to
come
,
and
was
therefore
compelled
to
be
lenient
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
consequences
of
this
episode
was
that
the
first
joints
of
*NL*
three
of
the
little
boy
's
fingers
were
permanently
disabled
,
and
another
*NL*
that
thereafter
he
always
had
to
be
beaten
before
he
set
out
to
work
,
*NL*
whenever
there
was
fresh
snow
on
the
ground
.
Jurgis
was
called
upon
to
*NL*
do
the
beating
,
and
as
it
hurt
his
foot
he
did
it
with
a
vengeance
;
but
*NL*
it
did
not
tend
to
add
to
the
sweetness
of
his
temper
.
They
say
that
the
*NL*
best
dog
will
turn
cross
if
he
be
kept
chained
all
the
time
,
and
it
*NL*
was
the
same
with
the
man
;
he
had
not
a
thing
to
do
all
day
but
lie
and
*NL*
curse
his
fate
,
and
the
time
came
when
he
wanted
to
curse
everything
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
never
for
very
long
,
however
,
for
when
Ona
began
to
cry
,
Jurgis
*NL*
could
not
stay
angry
.
The
poor
fellow
looked
like
a
homeless
ghost
,
with
*NL*
his
cheeks
sunken
in
and
his
long
black
hair
straggling
into
his
eyes
;
*NL*
he
was
too
discouraged
to
cut
it
,
or
to
think
about
his
appearance
.
His
*NL*
muscles
were
wasting
away
,
and
what
were
left
were
soft
and
flabby
.
He
*NL*
had
no
appetite
,
and
they
could
not
afford
to
tempt
him
with
delicacies
.
*NL*
It
was
better
,
he
said
,
that
he
should
not
eat
,
it
was
a
saving
.
About
*NL*
the
end
of
March
he
had
got
hold
of
Ona
's
bankbook
,
and
learned
that
*NL*
there
was
only
three
dollars
left
to
them
in
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
perhaps
the
worst
of
the
consequences
of
this
long
siege
was
that
*NL*
they
lost
another
member
of
their
family
;
Brother
Jonas
disappeared
.
One
*NL*
Saturday
night
he
did
not
come
home
,
and
thereafter
all
their
efforts
to
*NL*
get
trace
of
him
were
futile
.
It
was
said
by
the
boss
at
Durham
's
that
*NL*
he
had
gotten
his
week
's
money
and
left
there
.
That
might
not
be
true
,
*NL*
of
course
,
for
sometimes
they
would
say
that
when
a
man
had
been
killed
;
*NL*
it
was
the
easiest
way
out
of
it
for
all
concerned
.
When
,
for
instance
,
*NL*
a
man
had
fallen
into
one
of
the
rendering
tanks
and
had
been
made
into
*NL*
pure
leaf
lard
and
peerless
fertilizer
,
there
was
no
use
letting
the
*NL*
fact
out
and
making
his
family
unhappy
.
More
probable
,
however
,
was
*NL*
the
theory
that
Jonas
had
deserted
them
,
and
gone
on
the
road
,
seeking
*NL*
happiness
.
He
had
been
discontented
for
a
long
time
,
and
not
without
*NL*
some
cause
.
He
paid
good
board
,
and
was
yet
obliged
to
live
in
a
family
*NL*
where
nobody
had
enough
to
eat
.
And
Marija
would
keep
giving
them
all
*NL*
her
money
,
and
of
course
he
could
not
but
feel
that
he
was
called
upon
*NL*
to
do
the
same
.
Then
there
were
crying
brats
,
and
all
sorts
of
misery
;
*NL*
a
man
would
have
had
to
be
a
good
deal
of
a
hero
to
stand
it
all
without
*NL*
grumbling
,
and
Jonas
was
not
in
the
least
a
hero
--
he
was
simply
a
*NL*
weatherbeaten
old
fellow
who
liked
to
have
a
good
supper
and
sit
in
the
*NL*
corner
by
the
fire
and
smoke
his
pipe
in
peace
before
he
went
to
bed
.
*NL*
Here
there
was
not
room
by
the
fire
,
and
through
the
winter
the
kitchen
*NL*
had
seldom
been
warm
enough
for
comfort
.
So
,
with
the
springtime
,
what
*NL*
was
more
likely
than
that
the
wild
idea
of
escaping
had
come
to
him
?
*NL*
Two
years
he
had
been
yoked
like
a
horse
to
a
half-ton
truck
in
Durham
's
*NL*
dark
cellars
,
with
never
a
rest
,
save
on
Sundays
and
four
holidays
in
*NL*
the
year
,
and
with
never
a
word
of
thanks
--
only
kicks
and
blows
and
*NL*
curses
,
such
as
no
decent
dog
would
have
stood
.
And
now
the
winter
was
*NL*
over
,
and
the
spring
winds
were
blowing
--
and
with
a
day
's
walk
a
man
*NL*
might
put
the
smoke
of
Packingtown
behind
him
forever
,
and
be
where
the
*NL*
grass
was
green
and
the
flowers
all
the
colors
of
the
rainbow
!
*NL*
*NL*
But
now
the
income
of
the
family
was
cut
down
more
than
one-third
,
and
*NL*
the
food
demand
was
cut
only
one-eleventh
,
so
that
they
were
worse
off
*NL*
than
ever
.
Also
they
were
borrowing
money
from
Marija
,
and
eating
up
*NL*
her
bank
account
,
and
spoiling
once
again
her
hopes
of
marriage
and
*NL*
happiness
.
And
they
were
even
going
into
debt
to
Tamoszius
Kuszleika
*NL*
and
letting
him
impoverish
himself
.
Poor
Tamoszius
was
a
man
without
*NL*
any
relatives
,
and
with
a
wonderful
talent
besides
,
and
he
ought
to
*NL*
have
made
money
and
prospered
;
but
he
had
fallen
in
love
,
and
so
given
*NL*
hostages
to
fortune
,
and
was
doomed
to
be
dragged
down
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
it
was
finally
decided
that
two
more
of
the
children
would
have
to
*NL*
leave
school
.
Next
to
Stanislovas
,
who
was
now
fifteen
,
there
was
a
*NL*
girl
,
little
Kotrina
,
who
was
two
years
younger
,
and
then
two
boys
,
*NL*
Vilimas
,
who
was
eleven
,
and
Nikalojus
,
who
was
ten
.
Both
of
these
last
*NL*
were
bright
boys
,
and
there
was
no
reason
why
their
family
should
starve
*NL*
when
tens
of
thousands
of
children
no
older
were
earning
their
own
*NL*
livings
.
So
one
morning
they
were
given
a
quarter
apiece
and
a
roll
with
*NL*
a
sausage
in
it
,
and
,
with
their
minds
top-heavy
with
good
advice
,
were
*NL*
sent
out
to
make
their
way
to
the
city
and
learn
to
sell
newspapers
.
*NL*
They
came
back
late
at
night
in
tears
,
having
walked
for
the
five
or
*NL*
six
miles
to
report
that
a
man
had
offered
to
take
them
to
a
place
where
*NL*
they
sold
newspapers
,
and
had
taken
their
money
and
gone
into
a
store
to
*NL*
get
them
,
and
nevermore
been
seen
.
So
they
both
received
a
whipping
,
and
*NL*
the
next
morning
set
out
again
.
This
time
they
found
the
newspaper
*NL*
place
,
and
procured
their
stock
;
and
after
wandering
about
till
nearly
*NL*
noontime
,
saying
``
Paper
?
''
to
every
one
they
saw
,
they
had
all
their
*NL*
stock
taken
away
and
received
a
thrashing
besides
from
a
big
newsman
*NL*
upon
whose
territory
they
had
trespassed
.
Fortunately
,
however
,
they
*NL*
had
already
sold
some
papers
,
and
came
back
with
nearly
as
much
as
they
*NL*
started
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
week
of
mishaps
such
as
these
,
the
two
little
fellows
began
to
*NL*
learn
the
ways
of
the
trade
--
the
names
of
the
different
papers
,
and
how
*NL*
many
of
each
to
get
,
and
what
sort
of
people
to
offer
them
to
,
and
where
*NL*
to
go
and
where
to
stay
away
from
.
After
this
,
leaving
home
at
four
*NL*
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
and
running
about
the
streets
,
first
with
*NL*
morning
papers
and
then
with
evening
,
they
might
come
home
late
at
night
*NL*
with
twenty
or
thirty
cents
apiece
--
possibly
as
much
as
forty
cents
.
*NL*
From
this
they
had
to
deduct
their
carfare
,
since
the
distance
was
so
*NL*
great
;
but
after
a
while
they
made
friends
,
and
learned
still
more
,
and
*NL*
then
they
would
save
their
carfare
.
They
would
get
on
a
car
when
the
*NL*
conductor
was
not
looking
,
and
hide
in
the
crowd
;
and
three
times
out
*NL*
of
four
he
would
not
ask
for
their
fares
,
either
not
seeing
them
,
*NL*
or
thinking
they
had
already
paid
;
or
if
he
did
ask
,
they
would
hunt
*NL*
through
their
pockets
,
and
then
begin
to
cry
,
and
either
have
their
*NL*
fares
paid
by
some
kind
old
lady
,
or
else
try
the
trick
again
on
a
new
*NL*
car
.
All
this
was
fair
play
,
they
felt
.
Whose
fault
was
it
that
at
the
*NL*
hours
when
workingmen
were
going
to
their
work
and
back
,
the
cars
were
*NL*
so
crowded
that
the
conductors
could
not
collect
all
the
fares
?
And
*NL*
besides
,
the
companies
were
thieves
,
people
said
--
had
stolen
all
their
*NL*
franchises
with
the
help
of
scoundrelly
politicians
!
*NL*
*NL*
Now
that
the
winter
was
by
,
and
there
was
no
more
danger
of
snow
,
and
no
*NL*
more
coal
to
buy
,
and
another
room
warm
enough
to
put
the
children
into
*NL*
when
they
cried
,
and
enough
money
to
get
along
from
week
to
week
*NL*
with
,
Jurgis
was
less
terrible
than
he
had
been
.
A
man
can
get
used
*NL*
to
anything
in
the
course
of
time
,
and
Jurgis
had
gotten
used
to
lying
*NL*
about
the
house
.
Ona
saw
this
,
and
was
very
careful
not
to
destroy
his
*NL*
peace
of
mind
,
by
letting
him
know
how
very
much
pain
she
was
suffering
.
*NL*
It
was
now
the
time
of
the
spring
rains
,
and
Ona
had
often
to
ride
to
*NL*
her
work
,
in
spite
of
the
expense
;
she
was
getting
paler
every
day
,
and
*NL*
sometimes
,
in
spite
of
her
good
resolutions
,
it
pained
her
that
Jurgis
*NL*
did
not
notice
it
.
She
wondered
if
he
cared
for
her
as
much
as
ever
,
if
*NL*
all
this
misery
was
not
wearing
out
his
love
.
She
had
to
be
away
from
*NL*
him
all
the
time
,
and
bear
her
own
troubles
while
he
was
bearing
his
;
*NL*
and
then
,
when
she
came
home
,
she
was
so
worn
out
;
and
whenever
they
*NL*
talked
they
had
only
their
worries
to
talk
of
--
truly
it
was
hard
,
in
*NL*
such
a
life
,
to
keep
any
sentiment
alive
.
The
woe
of
this
would
flame
up
*NL*
in
Ona
sometimes
--
at
night
she
would
suddenly
clasp
her
big
husband
*NL*
in
her
arms
and
break
into
passionate
weeping
,
demanding
to
know
if
*NL*
he
really
loved
her
.
Poor
Jurgis
,
who
had
in
truth
grown
more
*NL*
matter-of-fact
,
under
the
endless
pressure
of
penury
,
would
not
know
*NL*
what
to
make
of
these
things
,
and
could
only
try
to
recollect
when
*NL*
he
had
last
been
cross
;
and
so
Ona
would
have
to
forgive
him
and
sob
*NL*
herself
to
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
part
of
April
Jurgis
went
to
see
the
doctor
,
and
was
given
a
*NL*
bandage
to
lace
about
his
ankle
,
and
told
that
he
might
go
back
to
work
.
*NL*
It
needed
more
than
the
permission
of
the
doctor
,
however
,
for
when
he
*NL*
showed
up
on
the
killing
floor
of
Brown
's
,
he
was
told
by
the
foreman
*NL*
that
it
had
not
been
possible
to
keep
his
job
for
him
.
Jurgis
knew
that
*NL*
this
meant
simply
that
the
foreman
had
found
some
one
else
to
do
the
*NL*
work
as
well
and
did
not
want
to
bother
to
make
a
change
.
He
stood
in
*NL*
the
doorway
,
looking
mournfully
on
,
seeing
his
friends
and
companions
at
*NL*
work
,
and
feeling
like
an
outcast
.
Then
he
went
out
and
took
his
place
*NL*
with
the
mob
of
the
unemployed
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
time
,
however
,
Jurgis
did
not
have
the
same
fine
confidence
,
nor
*NL*
the
same
reason
for
it
.
He
was
no
longer
the
finest-looking
man
in
the
*NL*
throng
,
and
the
bosses
no
longer
made
for
him
;
he
was
thin
and
haggard
,
*NL*
and
his
clothes
were
seedy
,
and
he
looked
miserable
.
And
there
were
*NL*
hundreds
who
looked
and
felt
just
like
him
,
and
who
had
been
wandering
*NL*
about
Packingtown
for
months
begging
for
work
.
This
was
a
critical
time
*NL*
in
Jurgis
'
life
,
and
if
he
had
been
a
weaker
man
he
would
have
gone
*NL*
the
way
the
rest
did
.
Those
out-of-work
wretches
would
stand
about
the
*NL*
packing
houses
every
morning
till
the
police
drove
them
away
,
and
then
*NL*
they
would
scatter
among
the
saloons
.
Very
few
of
them
had
the
nerve
*NL*
to
face
the
rebuffs
that
they
would
encounter
by
trying
to
get
into
the
*NL*
buildings
to
interview
the
bosses
;
if
they
did
not
get
a
chance
in
the
*NL*
morning
,
there
would
be
nothing
to
do
but
hang
about
the
saloons
the
*NL*
rest
of
the
day
and
night
.
Jurgis
was
saved
from
all
this
--
partly
,
to
*NL*
be
sure
,
because
it
was
pleasant
weather
,
and
there
was
no
need
to
*NL*
be
indoors
;
but
mainly
because
he
carried
with
him
always
the
pitiful
*NL*
little
face
of
his
wife
.
He
must
get
work
,
he
told
himself
,
fighting
*NL*
the
battle
with
despair
every
hour
of
the
day
.
He
must
get
work
!
He
must
*NL*
have
a
place
again
and
some
money
saved
up
,
before
the
next
winter
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
was
no
work
for
him
.
He
sought
out
all
the
members
of
his
*NL*
union
--
Jurgis
had
stuck
to
the
union
through
all
this
--
and
begged
them
*NL*
to
speak
a
word
for
him
.
He
went
to
every
one
he
knew
,
asking
for
a
*NL*
chance
,
there
or
anywhere
.
He
wandered
all
day
through
the
buildings
;
*NL*
and
in
a
week
or
two
,
when
he
had
been
all
over
the
yards
,
and
into
*NL*
every
room
to
which
he
had
access
,
and
learned
that
there
was
not
a
job
*NL*
anywhere
,
he
persuaded
himself
that
there
might
have
been
a
change
in
*NL*
the
places
he
had
first
visited
,
and
began
the
round
all
over
;
till
*NL*
finally
the
watchmen
and
the
``
spotters
''
of
the
companies
came
to
know
*NL*
him
by
sight
and
to
order
him
out
with
threats
.
Then
there
was
nothing
*NL*
more
for
him
to
do
but
go
with
the
crowd
in
the
morning
,
and
keep
in
*NL*
the
front
row
and
look
eager
,
and
when
he
failed
,
go
back
home
,
and
play
*NL*
with
little
Kotrina
and
the
baby
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
peculiar
bitterness
of
all
this
was
that
Jurgis
saw
so
plainly
the
*NL*
meaning
of
it
.
In
the
beginning
he
had
been
fresh
and
strong
,
and
he
*NL*
had
gotten
a
job
the
first
day
;
but
now
he
was
second-hand
,
a
damaged
*NL*
article
,
so
to
speak
,
and
they
did
not
want
him
.
They
had
got
the
*NL*
best
of
him
--
they
had
worn
him
out
,
with
their
speeding-up
and
their
*NL*
carelessness
,
and
now
they
had
thrown
him
away
!
And
Jurgis
would
make
*NL*
the
acquaintance
of
others
of
these
unemployed
men
and
find
that
they
*NL*
had
all
had
the
same
experience
.
There
were
some
,
of
course
,
who
had
*NL*
wandered
in
from
other
places
,
who
had
been
ground
up
in
other
mills
;
*NL*
there
were
others
who
were
out
from
their
own
fault
--
some
,
for
instance
,
*NL*
who
had
not
been
able
to
stand
the
awful
grind
without
drink
.
The
vast
*NL*
majority
,
however
,
were
simply
the
worn-out
parts
of
the
great
merciless
*NL*
packing
machine
;
they
had
toiled
there
,
and
kept
up
with
the
pace
,
some
*NL*
of
them
for
ten
or
twenty
years
,
until
finally
the
time
had
come
when
*NL*
they
could
not
keep
up
with
it
any
more
.
Some
had
been
frankly
told
*NL*
that
they
were
too
old
,
that
a
sprier
man
was
needed
;
others
had
given
*NL*
occasion
,
by
some
act
of
carelessness
or
incompetence
;
with
most
,
*NL*
however
,
the
occasion
had
been
the
same
as
with
Jurgis
.
They
had
been
*NL*
overworked
and
underfed
so
long
,
and
finally
some
disease
had
laid
them
*NL*
on
their
backs
;
or
they
had
cut
themselves
,
and
had
blood
poisoning
,
or
*NL*
met
with
some
other
accident
.
When
a
man
came
back
after
that
,
he
would
*NL*
get
his
place
back
only
by
the
courtesy
of
the
boss
.
To
this
there
was
*NL*
no
exception
,
save
when
the
accident
was
one
for
which
the
firm
was
*NL*
liable
;
in
that
case
they
would
send
a
slippery
lawyer
to
see
him
,
first
*NL*
to
try
to
get
him
to
sign
away
his
claims
,
but
if
he
was
too
smart
for
*NL*
that
,
to
promise
him
that
he
and
his
should
always
be
provided
with
*NL*
work
.
This
promise
they
would
keep
,
strictly
and
to
the
letter
--
for
two
*NL*
years
.
Two
years
was
the
``
statute
of
limitations
,
''
and
after
that
the
*NL*
victim
could
not
sue
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
happened
to
a
man
after
any
of
these
things
,
all
depended
upon
*NL*
the
circumstances
.
If
he
were
of
the
highly
skilled
workers
,
he
would
*NL*
probably
have
enough
saved
up
to
tide
him
over
.
The
best
paid
men
,
*NL*
the
``
splitters
,
''
made
fifty
cents
an
hour
,
which
would
be
five
or
six
*NL*
dollars
a
day
in
the
rush
seasons
,
and
one
or
two
in
the
dullest
.
A
*NL*
man
could
live
and
save
on
that
;
but
then
there
were
only
half
a
dozen
*NL*
splitters
in
each
place
,
and
one
of
them
that
Jurgis
knew
had
a
family
*NL*
of
twenty-two
children
,
all
hoping
to
grow
up
to
be
splitters
like
their
*NL*
father
.
For
an
unskilled
man
,
who
made
ten
dollars
a
week
in
the
rush
*NL*
seasons
and
five
in
the
dull
,
it
all
depended
upon
his
age
and
the
*NL*
number
he
had
dependent
upon
him
.
An
unmarried
man
could
save
,
if
he
did
*NL*
not
drink
,
and
if
he
was
absolutely
selfish
--
that
is
,
if
he
paid
no
*NL*
heed
to
the
demands
of
his
old
parents
,
or
of
his
little
brothers
and
*NL*
sisters
,
or
of
any
other
relatives
he
might
have
,
as
well
as
of
the
*NL*
members
of
his
union
,
and
his
chums
,
and
the
people
who
might
be
*NL*
starving
to
death
next
door
.

Chapter
13
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
During
this
time
that
Jurgis
was
looking
for
work
occurred
the
death
*NL*
of
little
Kristoforas
,
one
of
the
children
of
Teta
Elzbieta
.
Both
*NL*
Kristoforas
and
his
brother
,
Juozapas
,
were
cripples
,
the
latter
having
*NL*
lost
one
leg
by
having
it
run
over
,
and
Kristoforas
having
congenital
*NL*
dislocation
of
the
hip
,
which
made
it
impossible
for
him
ever
to
walk
.
*NL*
He
was
the
last
of
Teta
Elzbieta
's
children
,
and
perhaps
he
had
been
*NL*
intended
by
nature
to
let
her
know
that
she
had
had
enough
.
At
any
rate
*NL*
he
was
wretchedly
sick
and
undersized
;
he
had
the
rickets
,
and
though
*NL*
he
was
over
three
years
old
,
he
was
no
bigger
than
an
ordinary
child
*NL*
of
one
.
All
day
long
he
would
crawl
around
the
floor
in
a
filthy
little
*NL*
dress
,
whining
and
fretting
;
because
the
floor
was
full
of
drafts
he
was
*NL*
always
catching
cold
,
and
snuffling
because
his
nose
ran
.
This
made
*NL*
him
a
nuisance
,
and
a
source
of
endless
trouble
in
the
family
.
For
his
*NL*
mother
,
with
unnatural
perversity
,
loved
him
best
of
all
her
children
,
*NL*
and
made
a
perpetual
fuss
over
him
--
would
let
him
do
anything
*NL*
undisturbed
,
and
would
burst
into
tears
when
his
fretting
drove
Jurgis
*NL*
wild
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
he
died
.
Perhaps
it
was
the
smoked
sausage
he
had
eaten
that
*NL*
morning
--
which
may
have
been
made
out
of
some
of
the
tubercular
pork
*NL*
that
was
condemned
as
unfit
for
export
.
At
any
rate
,
an
hour
after
*NL*
eating
it
,
the
child
had
begun
to
cry
with
pain
,
and
in
another
hour
he
*NL*
was
rolling
about
on
the
floor
in
convulsions
.
Little
Kotrina
,
who
was
*NL*
all
alone
with
him
,
ran
out
screaming
for
help
,
and
after
a
while
a
*NL*
doctor
came
,
but
not
until
Kristoforas
had
howled
his
last
howl
.
No
one
*NL*
was
really
sorry
about
this
except
poor
Elzbieta
,
who
was
inconsolable
.
*NL*
Jurgis
announced
that
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
the
child
would
have
*NL*
to
be
buried
by
the
city
,
since
they
had
no
money
for
a
funeral
;
and
at
*NL*
this
the
poor
woman
almost
went
out
of
her
senses
,
wringing
her
hands
*NL*
and
screaming
with
grief
and
despair
.
Her
child
to
be
buried
in
a
*NL*
pauper
's
grave
!
And
her
stepdaughter
to
stand
by
and
hear
it
said
*NL*
without
protesting
!
It
was
enough
to
make
Ona
's
father
rise
up
out
of
*NL*
his
grave
to
rebuke
her
!
If
it
had
come
to
this
,
they
might
as
well
give
*NL*
up
at
once
,
and
be
buried
all
of
them
together
!
...
In
the
end
Marija
*NL*
said
that
she
would
help
with
ten
dollars
;
and
Jurgis
being
still
*NL*
obdurate
,
Elzbieta
went
in
tears
and
begged
the
money
from
the
*NL*
neighbors
,
and
so
little
Kristoforas
had
a
mass
and
a
hearse
with
white
*NL*
plumes
on
it
,
and
a
tiny
plot
in
a
graveyard
with
a
wooden
cross
to
mark
*NL*
the
place
.
The
poor
mother
was
not
the
same
for
months
after
that
;
the
*NL*
mere
sight
of
the
floor
where
little
Kristoforas
had
crawled
about
would
*NL*
make
her
weep
.
He
had
never
had
a
fair
chance
,
poor
little
fellow
,
she
*NL*
would
say
.
He
had
been
handicapped
from
his
birth
.
If
only
she
had
heard
*NL*
about
it
in
time
,
so
that
she
might
have
had
that
great
doctor
to
cure
*NL*
him
of
his
lameness
!
...
Some
time
ago
,
Elzbieta
was
told
,
a
Chicago
*NL*
billionaire
had
paid
a
fortune
to
bring
a
great
European
surgeon
over
to
*NL*
cure
his
little
daughter
of
the
same
disease
from
which
Kristoforas
had
*NL*
suffered
.
And
because
this
surgeon
had
to
have
bodies
to
demonstrate
*NL*
upon
,
he
announced
that
he
would
treat
the
children
of
the
poor
,
a
piece
*NL*
of
magnanimity
over
which
the
papers
became
quite
eloquent
.
Elzbieta
,
*NL*
alas
,
did
not
read
the
papers
,
and
no
one
had
told
her
;
but
perhaps
it
*NL*
was
as
well
,
for
just
then
they
would
not
have
had
the
carfare
to
spare
*NL*
to
go
every
day
to
wait
upon
the
surgeon
,
nor
for
that
matter
anybody
*NL*
with
the
time
to
take
the
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
while
that
he
was
seeking
for
work
,
there
was
a
dark
shadow
*NL*
hanging
over
Jurgis
;
as
if
a
savage
beast
were
lurking
somewhere
in
the
*NL*
pathway
of
his
life
,
and
he
knew
it
,
and
yet
could
not
help
approaching
*NL*
the
place
.
There
are
all
stages
of
being
out
of
work
in
Packingtown
,
and
*NL*
he
faced
in
dread
the
prospect
of
reaching
the
lowest
.
There
is
a
place
*NL*
that
waits
for
the
lowest
man
--
the
fertilizer
plant
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
men
would
talk
about
it
in
awe-stricken
whispers
.
Not
more
than
one
*NL*
in
ten
had
ever
really
tried
it
;
the
other
nine
had
contented
themselves
*NL*
with
hearsay
evidence
and
a
peep
through
the
door
.
There
were
some
*NL*
things
worse
than
even
starving
to
death
.
They
would
ask
Jurgis
if
he
*NL*
had
worked
there
yet
,
and
if
he
meant
to
;
and
Jurgis
would
debate
the
*NL*
matter
with
himself
.
As
poor
as
they
were
,
and
making
all
the
sacrifices
*NL*
that
they
were
,
would
he
dare
to
refuse
any
sort
of
work
that
was
*NL*
offered
to
him
,
be
it
as
horrible
as
ever
it
could
?
Would
he
dare
to
go
*NL*
home
and
eat
bread
that
had
been
earned
by
Ona
,
weak
and
complaining
as
*NL*
she
was
,
knowing
that
he
had
been
given
a
chance
,
and
had
not
had
the
*NL*
nerve
to
take
it
?
--
And
yet
he
might
argue
that
way
with
himself
all
*NL*
day
,
and
one
glimpse
into
the
fertilizer
works
would
send
him
away
again
*NL*
shuddering
.
He
was
a
man
,
and
he
would
do
his
duty
;
he
went
and
made
*NL*
application
--
but
surely
he
was
not
also
required
to
hope
for
success
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
fertilizer
works
of
Durham
's
lay
away
from
the
rest
of
the
plant
.
*NL*
Few
visitors
ever
saw
them
,
and
the
few
who
did
would
come
out
looking
*NL*
like
Dante
,
of
whom
the
peasants
declared
that
he
had
been
into
hell
.
To
*NL*
this
part
of
the
yards
came
all
the
``
tankage
''
and
the
waste
products
of
*NL*
all
sorts
;
here
they
dried
out
the
bones
,
--
and
in
suffocating
cellars
*NL*
where
the
daylight
never
came
you
might
see
men
and
women
and
children
*NL*
bending
over
whirling
machines
and
sawing
bits
of
bone
into
all
sorts
of
*NL*
shapes
,
breathing
their
lungs
full
of
the
fine
dust
,
and
doomed
to
die
,
*NL*
every
one
of
them
,
within
a
certain
definite
time
.
Here
they
made
the
*NL*
blood
into
albumen
,
and
made
other
foul-smelling
things
into
things
*NL*
still
more
foul-smelling
.
In
the
corridors
and
caverns
where
it
was
done
*NL*
you
might
lose
yourself
as
in
the
great
caves
of
Kentucky
.
In
the
dust
*NL*
and
the
steam
the
electric
lights
would
shine
like
far-off
twinkling
*NL*
stars
--
red
and
blue-green
and
purple
stars
,
according
to
the
color
of
*NL*
the
mist
and
the
brew
from
which
it
came
.
For
the
odors
of
these
ghastly
*NL*
charnel
houses
there
may
be
words
in
Lithuanian
,
but
there
are
none
in
*NL*
English
.
The
person
entering
would
have
to
summon
his
courage
as
for
a
*NL*
cold-water
plunge
.
He
would
go
in
like
a
man
swimming
under
water
;
he
*NL*
would
put
his
handkerchief
over
his
face
,
and
begin
to
cough
and
choke
;
*NL*
and
then
,
if
he
were
still
obstinate
,
he
would
find
his
head
beginning
*NL*
to
ring
,
and
the
veins
in
his
forehead
to
throb
,
until
finally
he
would
*NL*
be
assailed
by
an
overpowering
blast
of
ammonia
fumes
,
and
would
turn
*NL*
and
run
for
his
life
,
and
come
out
half-dazed
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
top
of
this
were
the
rooms
where
they
dried
the
``
tankage
,
''
the
mass
*NL*
of
brown
stringy
stuff
that
was
left
after
the
waste
portions
of
the
*NL*
carcasses
had
had
the
lard
and
tallow
dried
out
of
them
.
This
dried
*NL*
material
they
would
then
grind
to
a
fine
powder
,
and
after
they
had
*NL*
mixed
it
up
well
with
a
mysterious
but
inoffensive
brown
rock
which
they
*NL*
brought
in
and
ground
up
by
the
hundreds
of
carloads
for
that
purpose
,
*NL*
the
substance
was
ready
to
be
put
into
bags
and
sent
out
to
the
world
*NL*
as
any
one
of
a
hundred
different
brands
of
standard
bone
phosphate
.
And
*NL*
then
the
farmer
in
Maine
or
California
or
Texas
would
buy
this
,
at
say
*NL*
twenty-five
dollars
a
ton
,
and
plant
it
with
his
corn
;
and
for
several
*NL*
days
after
the
operation
the
fields
would
have
a
strong
odor
,
and
the
*NL*
farmer
and
his
wagon
and
the
very
horses
that
had
hauled
it
would
all
*NL*
have
it
too
.
In
Packingtown
the
fertilizer
is
pure
,
instead
of
being
a
*NL*
flavoring
,
and
instead
of
a
ton
or
so
spread
out
on
several
acres
under
*NL*
the
open
sky
,
there
are
hundreds
and
thousands
of
tons
of
it
in
one
*NL*
building
,
heaped
here
and
there
in
haystack
piles
,
covering
the
floor
*NL*
several
inches
deep
,
and
filling
the
air
with
a
choking
dust
that
*NL*
becomes
a
blinding
sandstorm
when
the
wind
stirs
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
to
this
building
that
Jurgis
came
daily
,
as
if
dragged
by
an
*NL*
unseen
hand
.
The
month
of
May
was
an
exceptionally
cool
one
,
and
*NL*
his
secret
prayers
were
granted
;
but
early
in
June
there
came
a
*NL*
record-breaking
hot
spell
,
and
after
that
there
were
men
wanted
in
the
*NL*
fertilizer
mill
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boss
of
the
grinding
room
had
come
to
know
Jurgis
by
this
time
,
and
*NL*
had
marked
him
for
a
likely
man
;
and
so
when
he
came
to
the
door
about
*NL*
two
o'clock
this
breathless
hot
day
,
he
felt
a
sudden
spasm
of
pain
*NL*
shoot
through
him
--
the
boss
beckoned
to
him
!
In
ten
minutes
more
Jurgis
*NL*
had
pulled
off
his
coat
and
overshirt
,
and
set
his
teeth
together
and
*NL*
gone
to
work
.
Here
was
one
more
difficulty
for
him
to
meet
and
conquer
!
*NL*
*NL*
His
labor
took
him
about
one
minute
to
learn
.
Before
him
was
one
of
*NL*
the
vents
of
the
mill
in
which
the
fertilizer
was
being
ground
--
rushing
*NL*
forth
in
a
great
brown
river
,
with
a
spray
of
the
finest
dust
flung
*NL*
forth
in
clouds
.
Jurgis
was
given
a
shovel
,
and
along
with
half
a
dozen
*NL*
others
it
was
his
task
to
shovel
this
fertilizer
into
carts
.
That
others
*NL*
were
at
work
he
knew
by
the
sound
,
and
by
the
fact
that
he
sometimes
*NL*
collided
with
them
;
otherwise
they
might
as
well
not
have
been
there
,
*NL*
for
in
the
blinding
dust
storm
a
man
could
not
see
six
feet
in
front
of
*NL*
his
face
.
When
he
had
filled
one
cart
he
had
to
grope
around
him
until
*NL*
another
came
,
and
if
there
was
none
on
hand
he
continued
to
grope
till
*NL*
one
arrived
.
In
five
minutes
he
was
,
of
course
,
a
mass
of
fertilizer
*NL*
from
head
to
feet
;
they
gave
him
a
sponge
to
tie
over
his
mouth
,
so
that
*NL*
he
could
breathe
,
but
the
sponge
did
not
prevent
his
lips
and
eyelids
*NL*
from
caking
up
with
it
and
his
ears
from
filling
solid
.
He
looked
like
*NL*
a
brown
ghost
at
twilight
--
from
hair
to
shoes
he
became
the
color
of
the
*NL*
building
and
of
everything
in
it
,
and
for
that
matter
a
hundred
yards
*NL*
outside
it
.
The
building
had
to
be
left
open
,
and
when
the
wind
blew
*NL*
Durham
and
Company
lost
a
great
deal
of
fertilizer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Working
in
his
shirt
sleeves
,
and
with
the
thermometer
at
over
a
*NL*
hundred
,
the
phosphates
soaked
in
through
every
pore
of
Jurgis
'
skin
,
*NL*
and
in
five
minutes
he
had
a
headache
,
and
in
fifteen
was
almost
dazed
.
*NL*
The
blood
was
pounding
in
his
brain
like
an
engine
's
throbbing
;
there
*NL*
was
a
frightful
pain
in
the
top
of
his
skull
,
and
he
could
hardly
*NL*
control
his
hands
.
Still
,
with
the
memory
of
his
four
months
'
siege
*NL*
behind
him
,
he
fought
on
,
in
a
frenzy
of
determination
;
and
half
an
hour
*NL*
later
he
began
to
vomit
--
he
vomited
until
it
seemed
as
if
his
inwards
*NL*
must
be
torn
into
shreds
.
A
man
could
get
used
to
the
fertilizer
mill
,
*NL*
the
boss
had
said
,
if
he
would
make
up
his
mind
to
it
;
but
Jurgis
now
*NL*
began
to
see
that
it
was
a
question
of
making
up
his
stomach
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
end
of
that
day
of
horror
,
he
could
scarcely
stand
.
He
had
to
*NL*
catch
himself
now
and
then
,
and
lean
against
a
building
and
get
his
*NL*
bearings
.
Most
of
the
men
,
when
they
came
out
,
made
straight
for
a
*NL*
saloon
--
they
seemed
to
place
fertilizer
and
rattlesnake
poison
in
one
*NL*
class
.
But
Jurgis
was
too
ill
to
think
of
drinking
--
he
could
only
make
*NL*
his
way
to
the
street
and
stagger
on
to
a
car
.
He
had
a
sense
of
humor
,
*NL*
and
later
on
,
when
he
became
an
old
hand
,
he
used
to
think
it
fun
to
*NL*
board
a
streetcar
and
see
what
happened
.
Now
,
however
,
he
was
too
ill
to
*NL*
notice
it
--
how
the
people
in
the
car
began
to
gasp
and
sputter
,
to
*NL*
put
their
handkerchiefs
to
their
noses
,
and
transfix
him
with
furious
*NL*
glances
.
Jurgis
only
knew
that
a
man
in
front
of
him
immediately
got
up
*NL*
and
gave
him
a
seat
;
and
that
half
a
minute
later
the
two
people
on
each
*NL*
side
of
him
got
up
;
and
that
in
a
full
minute
the
crowded
car
was
nearly
*NL*
empty
--
those
passengers
who
could
not
get
room
on
the
platform
having
*NL*
gotten
out
to
walk
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
Jurgis
had
made
his
home
a
miniature
fertilizer
mill
a
minute
*NL*
after
entering
.
The
stuff
was
half
an
inch
deep
in
his
skin
--
his
whole
*NL*
system
was
full
of
it
,
and
it
would
have
taken
a
week
not
merely
of
*NL*
scrubbing
,
but
of
vigorous
exercise
,
to
get
it
out
of
him
.
As
it
was
,
he
*NL*
could
be
compared
with
nothing
known
to
men
,
save
that
newest
discovery
*NL*
of
the
savants
,
a
substance
which
emits
energy
for
an
unlimited
time
,
*NL*
without
being
itself
in
the
least
diminished
in
power
.
He
smelled
so
*NL*
that
he
made
all
the
food
at
the
table
taste
,
and
set
the
whole
family
*NL*
to
vomiting
;
for
himself
it
was
three
days
before
he
could
keep
anything
*NL*
upon
his
stomach
--
he
might
wash
his
hands
,
and
use
a
knife
and
fork
,
but
*NL*
were
not
his
mouth
and
throat
filled
with
the
poison
?
*NL*
*NL*
And
still
Jurgis
stuck
it
out
!
In
spite
of
splitting
headaches
he
would
*NL*
stagger
down
to
the
plant
and
take
up
his
stand
once
more
,
and
begin
to
*NL*
shovel
in
the
blinding
clouds
of
dust
.
And
so
at
the
end
of
the
week
he
*NL*
was
a
fertilizer
man
for
life
--
he
was
able
to
eat
again
,
and
though
*NL*
his
head
never
stopped
aching
,
it
ceased
to
be
so
bad
that
he
could
not
*NL*
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
So
there
passed
another
summer
.
It
was
a
summer
of
prosperity
,
all
over
*NL*
the
country
,
and
the
country
ate
generously
of
packing
house
products
,
*NL*
and
there
was
plenty
of
work
for
all
the
family
,
in
spite
of
the
*NL*
packers
'
efforts
to
keep
a
superfluity
of
labor
.
They
were
again
able
to
*NL*
pay
their
debts
and
to
begin
to
save
a
little
sum
;
but
there
were
one
or
*NL*
two
sacrifices
they
considered
too
heavy
to
be
made
for
long
--
it
was
*NL*
too
bad
that
the
boys
should
have
to
sell
papers
at
their
age
.
It
was
*NL*
utterly
useless
to
caution
them
and
plead
with
them
;
quite
without
*NL*
knowing
it
,
they
were
taking
on
the
tone
of
their
new
environment
.
They
*NL*
were
learning
to
swear
in
voluble
English
;
they
were
learning
to
pick
up
*NL*
cigar
stumps
and
smoke
them
,
to
pass
hours
of
their
time
gambling
with
*NL*
pennies
and
dice
and
cigarette
cards
;
they
were
learning
the
location
*NL*
of
all
the
houses
of
prostitution
on
the
``
Levee
,
''
and
the
names
of
*NL*
the
``
madames
''
who
kept
them
,
and
the
days
when
they
gave
their
state
*NL*
banquets
,
which
the
police
captains
and
the
big
politicians
all
*NL*
attended
.
If
a
visiting
``
country
customer
''
were
to
ask
them
,
they
could
*NL*
show
him
which
was
``
Hinkydink
's
''
famous
saloon
,
and
could
even
point
out
*NL*
to
him
by
name
the
different
gamblers
and
thugs
and
``
hold-up
men
''
who
*NL*
made
the
place
their
headquarters
.
And
worse
yet
,
the
boys
were
getting
*NL*
out
of
the
habit
of
coming
home
at
night
.
What
was
the
use
,
they
would
*NL*
ask
,
of
wasting
time
and
energy
and
a
possible
carfare
riding
out
to
*NL*
the
stockyards
every
night
when
the
weather
was
pleasant
and
they
could
*NL*
crawl
under
a
truck
or
into
an
empty
doorway
and
sleep
exactly
as
well
?
*NL*
So
long
as
they
brought
home
a
half
dollar
for
each
day
,
what
mattered
*NL*
it
when
they
brought
it
?
But
Jurgis
declared
that
from
this
to
ceasing
*NL*
to
come
at
all
would
not
be
a
very
long
step
,
and
so
it
was
decided
*NL*
that
Vilimas
and
Nikalojus
should
return
to
school
in
the
fall
,
and
*NL*
that
instead
Elzbieta
should
go
out
and
get
some
work
,
her
place
at
home
*NL*
being
taken
by
her
younger
daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Kotrina
was
like
most
children
of
the
poor
,
prematurely
made
old
;
*NL*
she
had
to
take
care
of
her
little
brother
,
who
was
a
cripple
,
and
also
*NL*
of
the
baby
;
she
had
to
cook
the
meals
and
wash
the
dishes
and
clean
*NL*
house
,
and
have
supper
ready
when
the
workers
came
home
in
the
evening
.
*NL*
She
was
only
thirteen
,
and
small
for
her
age
,
but
she
did
all
this
*NL*
without
a
murmur
;
and
her
mother
went
out
,
and
after
trudging
a
couple
*NL*
of
days
about
the
yards
,
settled
down
as
a
servant
of
a
``
sausage
*NL*
machine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elzbieta
was
used
to
working
,
but
she
found
this
change
a
hard
one
,
for
*NL*
the
reason
that
she
had
to
stand
motionless
upon
her
feet
from
seven
*NL*
o'clock
in
the
morning
till
half-past
twelve
,
and
again
from
one
till
*NL*
half-past
five
.
For
the
first
few
days
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
*NL*
could
not
stand
it
--
she
suffered
almost
as
much
as
Jurgis
had
from
the
*NL*
fertilizer
,
and
would
come
out
at
sundown
with
her
head
fairly
reeling
.
*NL*
Besides
this
,
she
was
working
in
one
of
the
dark
holes
,
by
electric
*NL*
light
,
and
the
dampness
,
too
,
was
deadly
--
there
were
always
puddles
of
*NL*
water
on
the
floor
,
and
a
sickening
odor
of
moist
flesh
in
the
room
.
The
*NL*
people
who
worked
here
followed
the
ancient
custom
of
nature
,
whereby
*NL*
the
ptarmigan
is
the
color
of
dead
leaves
in
the
fall
and
of
snow
in
the
*NL*
winter
,
and
the
chameleon
,
who
is
black
when
he
lies
upon
a
stump
and
*NL*
turns
green
when
he
moves
to
a
leaf
.
The
men
and
women
who
worked
in
*NL*
this
department
were
precisely
the
color
of
the
``
fresh
country
sausage
''
*NL*
they
made
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sausage-room
was
an
interesting
place
to
visit
,
for
two
or
three
*NL*
minutes
,
and
provided
that
you
did
not
look
at
the
people
;
the
machines
*NL*
were
perhaps
the
most
wonderful
things
in
the
entire
plant
.
Presumably
*NL*
sausages
were
once
chopped
and
stuffed
by
hand
,
and
if
so
it
would
*NL*
be
interesting
to
know
how
many
workers
had
been
displaced
by
these
*NL*
inventions
.
On
one
side
of
the
room
were
the
hoppers
,
into
which
men
*NL*
shoveled
loads
of
meat
and
wheelbarrows
full
of
spices
;
in
these
great
*NL*
bowls
were
whirling
knives
that
made
two
thousand
revolutions
a
minute
,
*NL*
and
when
the
meat
was
ground
fine
and
adulterated
with
potato
flour
,
*NL*
and
well
mixed
with
water
,
it
was
forced
to
the
stuffing
machines
on
*NL*
the
other
side
of
the
room
.
The
latter
were
tended
by
women
;
there
was
*NL*
a
sort
of
spout
,
like
the
nozzle
of
a
hose
,
and
one
of
the
women
would
*NL*
take
a
long
string
of
``
casing
''
and
put
the
end
over
the
nozzle
and
then
*NL*
work
the
whole
thing
on
,
as
one
works
on
the
finger
of
a
tight
glove
.
*NL*
This
string
would
be
twenty
or
thirty
feet
long
,
but
the
woman
would
*NL*
have
it
all
on
in
a
jiffy
;
and
when
she
had
several
on
,
she
would
press
*NL*
a
lever
,
and
a
stream
of
sausage
meat
would
be
shot
out
,
taking
*NL*
the
casing
with
it
as
it
came
.
Thus
one
might
stand
and
see
appear
,
*NL*
miraculously
born
from
the
machine
,
a
wriggling
snake
of
sausage
of
*NL*
incredible
length
.
In
front
was
a
big
pan
which
caught
these
creatures
,
*NL*
and
two
more
women
who
seized
them
as
fast
as
they
appeared
and
twisted
*NL*
them
into
links
.
This
was
for
the
uninitiated
the
most
perplexing
work
*NL*
of
all
;
for
all
that
the
woman
had
to
give
was
a
single
turn
of
the
*NL*
wrist
;
and
in
some
way
she
contrived
to
give
it
so
that
instead
of
an
*NL*
endless
chain
of
sausages
,
one
after
another
,
there
grew
under
her
hands
*NL*
a
bunch
of
strings
,
all
dangling
from
a
single
center
.
It
was
quite
like
*NL*
the
feat
of
a
prestidigitator
--
for
the
woman
worked
so
fast
that
the
eye
*NL*
could
literally
not
follow
her
,
and
there
was
only
a
mist
of
motion
,
*NL*
and
tangle
after
tangle
of
sausages
appearing
.
In
the
midst
of
the
mist
,
*NL*
however
,
the
visitor
would
suddenly
notice
the
tense
set
face
,
with
*NL*
the
two
wrinkles
graven
in
the
forehead
,
and
the
ghastly
pallor
of
the
*NL*
cheeks
;
and
then
he
would
suddenly
recollect
that
it
was
time
he
was
*NL*
going
on
.
The
woman
did
not
go
on
;
she
stayed
right
there
--
hour
after
*NL*
hour
,
day
after
day
,
year
after
year
,
twisting
sausage
links
and
racing
*NL*
with
death
.
It
was
piecework
,
and
she
was
apt
to
have
a
family
to
keep
*NL*
alive
;
and
stern
and
ruthless
economic
laws
had
arranged
it
that
she
*NL*
could
only
do
this
by
working
just
as
she
did
,
with
all
her
soul
upon
*NL*
her
work
,
and
with
never
an
instant
for
a
glance
at
the
well-dressed
*NL*
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
came
to
stare
at
her
,
as
at
some
wild
beast
in
*NL*
a
menagerie
.

Chapter
14
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
With
one
member
trimming
beef
in
a
cannery
,
and
another
working
in
a
*NL*
sausage
factory
,
the
family
had
a
first-hand
knowledge
of
the
great
*NL*
majority
of
Packingtown
swindles
.
For
it
was
the
custom
,
as
they
found
,
*NL*
whenever
meat
was
so
spoiled
that
it
could
not
be
used
for
anything
*NL*
else
,
either
to
can
it
or
else
to
chop
it
up
into
sausage
.
With
what
had
*NL*
been
told
them
by
Jonas
,
who
had
worked
in
the
pickle
rooms
,
they
could
*NL*
now
study
the
whole
of
the
spoiled-meat
industry
on
the
inside
,
and
read
*NL*
a
new
and
grim
meaning
into
that
old
Packingtown
jest
--
that
they
use
*NL*
everything
of
the
pig
except
the
squeal
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jonas
had
told
them
how
the
meat
that
was
taken
out
of
pickle
would
*NL*
often
be
found
sour
,
and
how
they
would
rub
it
up
with
soda
to
take
away
*NL*
the
smell
,
and
sell
it
to
be
eaten
on
free-lunch
counters
;
also
of
all
*NL*
the
miracles
of
chemistry
which
they
performed
,
giving
to
any
sort
of
*NL*
meat
,
fresh
or
salted
,
whole
or
chopped
,
any
color
and
any
flavor
and
*NL*
any
odor
they
chose
.
In
the
pickling
of
hams
they
had
an
ingenious
*NL*
apparatus
,
by
which
they
saved
time
and
increased
the
capacity
of
the
*NL*
plant
--
a
machine
consisting
of
a
hollow
needle
attached
to
a
pump
;
by
*NL*
plunging
this
needle
into
the
meat
and
working
with
his
foot
,
a
man
*NL*
could
fill
a
ham
with
pickle
in
a
few
seconds
.
And
yet
,
in
spite
of
*NL*
this
,
there
would
be
hams
found
spoiled
,
some
of
them
with
an
odor
so
*NL*
bad
that
a
man
could
hardly
bear
to
be
in
the
room
with
them
.
To
pump
*NL*
into
these
the
packers
had
a
second
and
much
stronger
pickle
which
*NL*
destroyed
the
odor
--
a
process
known
to
the
workers
as
``
giving
them
*NL*
thirty
per
cent
.
''
Also
,
after
the
hams
had
been
smoked
,
there
would
be
*NL*
found
some
that
had
gone
to
the
bad
.
Formerly
these
had
been
sold
as
*NL*
``
Number
Three
Grade
,
''
but
later
on
some
ingenious
person
had
hit
upon
*NL*
a
new
device
,
and
now
they
would
extract
the
bone
,
about
which
the
bad
*NL*
part
generally
lay
,
and
insert
in
the
hole
a
white-hot
iron
.
After
this
*NL*
invention
there
was
no
longer
Number
One
,
Two
,
and
Three
Grade
--
there
*NL*
was
only
Number
One
Grade
.
The
packers
were
always
originating
such
*NL*
schemes
--
they
had
what
they
called
``
boneless
hams
,
''
which
were
all
the
*NL*
odds
and
ends
of
pork
stuffed
into
casings
;
and
``
California
hams
,
''
which
*NL*
were
the
shoulders
,
with
big
knuckle
joints
,
and
nearly
all
the
meat
cut
*NL*
out
;
and
fancy
``
skinned
hams
,
''
which
were
made
of
the
oldest
hogs
,
whose
*NL*
skins
were
so
heavy
and
coarse
that
no
one
would
buy
them
--
that
is
,
*NL*
until
they
had
been
cooked
and
chopped
fine
and
labeled
``
head
cheese
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
only
when
the
whole
ham
was
spoiled
that
it
came
into
the
*NL*
department
of
Elzbieta
.
Cut
up
by
the
two-thousand-revolutions-a-minute
*NL*
flyers
,
and
mixed
with
half
a
ton
of
other
meat
,
no
odor
that
ever
was
*NL*
in
a
ham
could
make
any
difference
.
There
was
never
the
least
attention
*NL*
paid
to
what
was
cut
up
for
sausage
;
there
would
come
all
the
way
back
*NL*
from
Europe
old
sausage
that
had
been
rejected
,
and
that
was
moldy
and
*NL*
white
--
it
would
be
dosed
with
borax
and
glycerine
,
and
dumped
into
the
*NL*
hoppers
,
and
made
over
again
for
home
consumption
.
There
would
be
meat
*NL*
that
had
tumbled
out
on
the
floor
,
in
the
dirt
and
sawdust
,
where
the
*NL*
workers
had
tramped
and
spit
uncounted
billions
of
consumption
germs
.
*NL*
There
would
be
meat
stored
in
great
piles
in
rooms
;
and
the
water
from
*NL*
leaky
roofs
would
drip
over
it
,
and
thousands
of
rats
would
race
about
*NL*
on
it
.
It
was
too
dark
in
these
storage
places
to
see
well
,
but
a
man
*NL*
could
run
his
hand
over
these
piles
of
meat
and
sweep
off
handfuls
of
*NL*
the
dried
dung
of
rats
.
These
rats
were
nuisances
,
and
the
packers
would
*NL*
put
poisoned
bread
out
for
them
;
they
would
die
,
and
then
rats
,
bread
,
*NL*
and
meat
would
go
into
the
hoppers
together
.
This
is
no
fairy
story
and
*NL*
no
joke
;
the
meat
would
be
shoveled
into
carts
,
and
the
man
who
did
*NL*
the
shoveling
would
not
trouble
to
lift
out
a
rat
even
when
he
saw
*NL*
one
--
there
were
things
that
went
into
the
sausage
in
comparison
with
*NL*
which
a
poisoned
rat
was
a
tidbit
.
There
was
no
place
for
the
men
*NL*
to
wash
their
hands
before
they
ate
their
dinner
,
and
so
they
made
a
*NL*
practice
of
washing
them
in
the
water
that
was
to
be
ladled
into
the
*NL*
sausage
.
There
were
the
butt-ends
of
smoked
meat
,
and
the
scraps
of
*NL*
corned
beef
,
and
all
the
odds
and
ends
of
the
waste
of
the
plants
,
that
*NL*
would
be
dumped
into
old
barrels
in
the
cellar
and
left
there
.
Under
the
*NL*
system
of
rigid
economy
which
the
packers
enforced
,
there
were
some
jobs
*NL*
that
it
only
paid
to
do
once
in
a
long
time
,
and
among
these
was
the
*NL*
cleaning
out
of
the
waste
barrels
.
Every
spring
they
did
it
;
and
in
*NL*
the
barrels
would
be
dirt
and
rust
and
old
nails
and
stale
water
--
and
*NL*
cartload
after
cartload
of
it
would
be
taken
up
and
dumped
into
the
*NL*
hoppers
with
fresh
meat
,
and
sent
out
to
the
public
's
breakfast
.
Some
of
*NL*
it
they
would
make
into
``
smoked
''
sausage
--
but
as
the
smoking
took
*NL*
time
,
and
was
therefore
expensive
,
they
would
call
upon
their
chemistry
*NL*
department
,
and
preserve
it
with
borax
and
color
it
with
gelatine
to
*NL*
make
it
brown
.
All
of
their
sausage
came
out
of
the
same
bowl
,
but
when
*NL*
they
came
to
wrap
it
they
would
stamp
some
of
it
``
special
,
''
and
for
this
*NL*
they
would
charge
two
cents
more
a
pound
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Such
were
the
new
surroundings
in
which
Elzbieta
was
placed
,
and
such
*NL*
was
the
work
she
was
compelled
to
do
.
It
was
stupefying
,
brutalizing
*NL*
work
;
it
left
her
no
time
to
think
,
no
strength
for
anything
.
She
was
*NL*
part
of
the
machine
she
tended
,
and
every
faculty
that
was
not
needed
*NL*
for
the
machine
was
doomed
to
be
crushed
out
of
existence
.
There
was
*NL*
only
one
mercy
about
the
cruel
grind
--
that
it
gave
her
the
gift
of
*NL*
insensibility
.
Little
by
little
she
sank
into
a
torpor
--
she
fell
silent
.
*NL*
She
would
meet
Jurgis
and
Ona
in
the
evening
,
and
the
three
would
walk
*NL*
home
together
,
often
without
saying
a
word
.
Ona
,
too
,
was
falling
into
a
*NL*
habit
of
silence
--
Ona
,
who
had
once
gone
about
singing
like
a
bird
.
She
*NL*
was
sick
and
miserable
,
and
often
she
would
barely
have
strength
enough
*NL*
to
drag
herself
home
.
And
there
they
would
eat
what
they
had
to
eat
,
and
*NL*
afterward
,
because
there
was
only
their
misery
to
talk
of
,
they
would
*NL*
crawl
into
bed
and
fall
into
a
stupor
and
never
stir
until
it
was
time
*NL*
to
get
up
again
,
and
dress
by
candlelight
,
and
go
back
to
the
machines
.
*NL*
They
were
so
numbed
that
they
did
not
even
suffer
much
from
hunger
,
now
;
*NL*
only
the
children
continued
to
fret
when
the
food
ran
short
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
the
soul
of
Ona
was
not
dead
--
the
souls
of
none
of
them
were
dead
,
*NL*
but
only
sleeping
;
and
now
and
then
they
would
waken
,
and
these
were
*NL*
cruel
times
.
The
gates
of
memory
would
roll
open
--
old
joys
would
stretch
*NL*
out
their
arms
to
them
,
old
hopes
and
dreams
would
call
to
them
,
and
*NL*
they
would
stir
beneath
the
burden
that
lay
upon
them
,
and
feel
its
*NL*
forever
immeasurable
weight
.
They
could
not
even
cry
out
beneath
it
;
but
*NL*
anguish
would
seize
them
,
more
dreadful
than
the
agony
of
death
.
It
was
*NL*
a
thing
scarcely
to
be
spoken
--
a
thing
never
spoken
by
all
the
world
,
*NL*
that
will
not
know
its
own
defeat
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
beaten
;
they
had
lost
the
game
,
they
were
swept
aside
.
It
*NL*
was
not
less
tragic
because
it
was
so
sordid
,
because
it
had
to
do
with
*NL*
wages
and
grocery
bills
and
rents
.
They
had
dreamed
of
freedom
;
of
a
*NL*
chance
to
look
about
them
and
learn
something
;
to
be
decent
and
clean
,
*NL*
to
see
their
child
grow
up
to
be
strong
.
And
now
it
was
all
gone
--
it
*NL*
would
never
be
!
They
had
played
the
game
and
they
had
lost
.
Six
years
*NL*
more
of
toil
they
had
to
face
before
they
could
expect
the
least
*NL*
respite
,
the
cessation
of
the
payments
upon
the
house
;
and
how
cruelly
*NL*
certain
it
was
that
they
could
never
stand
six
years
of
such
a
life
as
*NL*
they
were
living
!
They
were
lost
,
they
were
going
down
--
and
there
was
*NL*
no
deliverance
for
them
,
no
hope
;
for
all
the
help
it
gave
them
the
vast
*NL*
city
in
which
they
lived
might
have
been
an
ocean
waste
,
a
wilderness
,
a
*NL*
desert
,
a
tomb
.
So
often
this
mood
would
come
to
Ona
,
in
the
nighttime
,
*NL*
when
something
wakened
her
;
she
would
lie
,
afraid
of
the
beating
of
her
*NL*
own
heart
,
fronting
the
blood-red
eyes
of
the
old
primeval
terror
of
*NL*
life
.
Once
she
cried
aloud
,
and
woke
Jurgis
,
who
was
tired
and
cross
.
*NL*
After
that
she
learned
to
weep
silently
--
their
moods
so
seldom
came
*NL*
together
now
!
It
was
as
if
their
hopes
were
buried
in
separate
graves
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
,
being
a
man
,
had
troubles
of
his
own
.
There
was
another
specter
*NL*
following
him
.
He
had
never
spoken
of
it
,
nor
would
he
allow
any
one
*NL*
else
to
speak
of
it
--
he
had
never
acknowledged
its
existence
to
himself
.
*NL*
Yet
the
battle
with
it
took
all
the
manhood
that
he
had
--
and
once
or
*NL*
twice
,
alas
,
a
little
more
.
Jurgis
had
discovered
drink
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
working
in
the
steaming
pit
of
hell
;
day
after
day
,
week
after
*NL*
week
--
until
now
,
there
was
not
an
organ
of
his
body
that
did
its
work
*NL*
without
pain
,
until
the
sound
of
ocean
breakers
echoed
in
his
head
day
*NL*
and
night
,
and
the
buildings
swayed
and
danced
before
him
as
he
went
*NL*
down
the
street
.
And
from
all
the
unending
horror
of
this
there
was
a
*NL*
respite
,
a
deliverance
--
he
could
drink
!
He
could
forget
the
pain
,
he
*NL*
could
slip
off
the
burden
;
he
would
see
clearly
again
,
he
would
be
*NL*
master
of
his
brain
,
of
his
thoughts
,
of
his
will
.
His
dead
self
would
*NL*
stir
in
him
,
and
he
would
find
himself
laughing
and
cracking
jokes
with
*NL*
his
companions
--
he
would
be
a
man
again
,
and
master
of
his
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
an
easy
thing
for
Jurgis
to
take
more
than
two
or
three
*NL*
drinks
.
With
the
first
drink
he
could
eat
a
meal
,
and
he
could
persuade
*NL*
himself
that
that
was
economy
;
with
the
second
he
could
eat
another
*NL*
meal
--
but
there
would
come
a
time
when
he
could
eat
no
more
,
and
then
*NL*
to
pay
for
a
drink
was
an
unthinkable
extravagance
,
a
defiance
of
the
*NL*
age-long
instincts
of
his
hunger-haunted
class
.
One
day
,
however
,
he
took
*NL*
the
plunge
,
and
drank
up
all
that
he
had
in
his
pockets
,
and
went
home
*NL*
half
``
piped
,
''
as
the
men
phrase
it
.
He
was
happier
than
he
had
been
in
a
*NL*
year
;
and
yet
,
because
he
knew
that
the
happiness
would
not
last
,
he
was
*NL*
savage
,
too
with
those
who
would
wreck
it
,
and
with
the
world
,
and
with
*NL*
his
life
;
and
then
again
,
beneath
this
,
he
was
sick
with
the
shame
of
*NL*
himself
.
Afterward
,
when
he
saw
the
despair
of
his
family
,
and
reckoned
*NL*
up
the
money
he
had
spent
,
the
tears
came
into
his
eyes
,
and
he
began
*NL*
the
long
battle
with
the
specter
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
battle
that
had
no
end
,
that
never
could
have
one
.
But
Jurgis
*NL*
did
not
realize
that
very
clearly
;
he
was
not
given
much
time
for
*NL*
reflection
.
He
simply
knew
that
he
was
always
fighting
.
Steeped
in
*NL*
misery
and
despair
as
he
was
,
merely
to
walk
down
the
street
was
to
be
*NL*
put
upon
the
rack
.
There
was
surely
a
saloon
on
the
corner
--
perhaps
on
*NL*
all
four
corners
,
and
some
in
the
middle
of
the
block
as
well
;
and
each
*NL*
one
stretched
out
a
hand
to
him
each
one
had
a
personality
of
its
own
,
*NL*
allurements
unlike
any
other
.
Going
and
coming
--
before
sunrise
and
*NL*
after
dark
--
there
was
warmth
and
a
glow
of
light
,
and
the
steam
of
hot
*NL*
food
,
and
perhaps
music
,
or
a
friendly
face
,
and
a
word
of
good
cheer
.
*NL*
Jurgis
developed
a
fondness
for
having
Ona
on
his
arm
whenever
he
went
*NL*
out
on
the
street
,
and
he
would
hold
her
tightly
,
and
walk
fast
.
It
was
*NL*
pitiful
to
have
Ona
know
of
this
--
it
drove
him
wild
to
think
of
it
;
the
*NL*
thing
was
not
fair
,
for
Ona
had
never
tasted
drink
,
and
so
could
not
*NL*
understand
.
Sometimes
,
in
desperate
hours
,
he
would
find
himself
wishing
*NL*
that
she
might
learn
what
it
was
,
so
that
he
need
not
be
ashamed
in
her
*NL*
presence
.
They
might
drink
together
,
and
escape
from
the
horror
--
escape
*NL*
for
a
while
,
come
what
would
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
there
came
a
time
when
nearly
all
the
conscious
life
of
Jurgis
*NL*
consisted
of
a
struggle
with
the
craving
for
liquor
.
He
would
have
ugly
*NL*
moods
,
when
he
hated
Ona
and
the
whole
family
,
because
they
stood
in
his
*NL*
way
.
He
was
a
fool
to
have
married
;
he
had
tied
himself
down
,
had
made
*NL*
himself
a
slave
.
It
was
all
because
he
was
a
married
man
that
he
was
*NL*
compelled
to
stay
in
the
yards
;
if
it
had
not
been
for
that
he
might
*NL*
have
gone
off
like
Jonas
,
and
to
hell
with
the
packers
.
There
were
few
*NL*
single
men
in
the
fertilizer
mill
--
and
those
few
were
working
only
for
a
*NL*
chance
to
escape
.
Meantime
,
too
,
they
had
something
to
think
about
while
*NL*
they
worked
,
--
they
had
the
memory
of
the
last
time
they
had
been
drunk
,
*NL*
and
the
hope
of
the
time
when
they
would
be
drunk
again
.
As
for
Jurgis
,
*NL*
he
was
expected
to
bring
home
every
penny
;
he
could
not
even
go
with
*NL*
the
men
at
noontime
--
he
was
supposed
to
sit
down
and
eat
his
dinner
on
a
*NL*
pile
of
fertilizer
dust
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
not
always
his
mood
,
of
course
;
he
still
loved
his
family
.
But
*NL*
just
now
was
a
time
of
trial
.
Poor
little
Antanas
,
for
instance
--
who
*NL*
had
never
failed
to
win
him
with
a
smile
--
little
Antanas
was
not
smiling
*NL*
just
now
,
being
a
mass
of
fiery
red
pimples
.
He
had
had
all
the
diseases
*NL*
that
babies
are
heir
to
,
in
quick
succession
,
scarlet
fever
,
mumps
,
and
*NL*
whooping
cough
in
the
first
year
,
and
now
he
was
down
with
the
measles
.
*NL*
There
was
no
one
to
attend
him
but
Kotrina
;
there
was
no
doctor
to
*NL*
help
him
,
because
they
were
too
poor
,
and
children
did
not
die
of
the
*NL*
measles
--
at
least
not
often
.
Now
and
then
Kotrina
would
find
time
to
sob
*NL*
over
his
woes
,
but
for
the
greater
part
of
the
time
he
had
to
be
left
*NL*
alone
,
barricaded
upon
the
bed
.
The
floor
was
full
of
drafts
,
and
if
he
*NL*
caught
cold
he
would
die
.
At
night
he
was
tied
down
,
lest
he
should
kick
*NL*
the
covers
off
him
,
while
the
family
lay
in
their
stupor
of
exhaustion
.
*NL*
He
would
lie
and
scream
for
hours
,
almost
in
convulsions
;
and
then
,
when
*NL*
he
was
worn
out
,
he
would
lie
whimpering
and
wailing
in
his
torment
.
*NL*
He
was
burning
up
with
fever
,
and
his
eyes
were
running
sores
;
in
*NL*
the
daytime
he
was
a
thing
uncanny
and
impish
to
behold
,
a
plaster
of
*NL*
pimples
and
sweat
,
a
great
purple
lump
of
misery
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
all
this
was
not
really
as
cruel
as
it
sounds
,
for
,
sick
as
he
was
,
*NL*
little
Antanas
was
the
least
unfortunate
member
of
that
family
.
He
*NL*
was
quite
able
to
bear
his
sufferings
--
it
was
as
if
he
had
all
these
*NL*
complaints
to
show
what
a
prodigy
of
health
he
was
.
He
was
the
child
of
*NL*
his
parents
'
youth
and
joy
;
he
grew
up
like
the
conjurer
's
rosebush
,
and
*NL*
all
the
world
was
his
oyster
.
In
general
,
he
toddled
around
the
kitchen
*NL*
all
day
with
a
lean
and
hungry
look
--
the
portion
of
the
family
's
*NL*
allowance
that
fell
to
him
was
not
enough
,
and
he
was
unrestrainable
in
*NL*
his
demand
for
more
.
Antanas
was
but
little
over
a
year
old
,
and
already
*NL*
no
one
but
his
father
could
manage
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
as
if
he
had
taken
all
of
his
mother
's
strength
--
had
left
*NL*
nothing
for
those
that
might
come
after
him
.
Ona
was
with
child
again
*NL*
now
,
and
it
was
a
dreadful
thing
to
contemplate
;
even
Jurgis
,
dumb
and
*NL*
despairing
as
he
was
,
could
not
but
understand
that
yet
other
agonies
*NL*
were
on
the
way
,
and
shudder
at
the
thought
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
Ona
was
visibly
going
to
pieces
.
In
the
first
place
she
was
*NL*
developing
a
cough
,
like
the
one
that
had
killed
old
Dede
Antanas
.
She
*NL*
had
had
a
trace
of
it
ever
since
that
fatal
morning
when
the
greedy
*NL*
streetcar
corporation
had
turned
her
out
into
the
rain
;
but
now
it
was
*NL*
beginning
to
grow
serious
,
and
to
wake
her
up
at
night
.
Even
worse
than
*NL*
that
was
the
fearful
nervousness
from
which
she
suffered
;
she
would
have
*NL*
frightful
headaches
and
fits
of
aimless
weeping
;
and
sometimes
she
would
*NL*
come
home
at
night
shuddering
and
moaning
,
and
would
fling
herself
down
*NL*
upon
the
bed
and
burst
into
tears
.
Several
times
she
was
quite
beside
*NL*
herself
and
hysterical
;
and
then
Jurgis
would
go
half-mad
with
fright
.
*NL*
Elzbieta
would
explain
to
him
that
it
could
not
be
helped
,
that
a
woman
*NL*
was
subject
to
such
things
when
she
was
pregnant
;
but
he
was
hardly
to
*NL*
be
persuaded
,
and
would
beg
and
plead
to
know
what
had
happened
.
She
*NL*
had
never
been
like
this
before
,
he
would
argue
--
it
was
monstrous
and
*NL*
unthinkable
.
It
was
the
life
she
had
to
live
,
the
accursed
work
she
had
*NL*
to
do
,
that
was
killing
her
by
inches
.
She
was
not
fitted
for
it
--
no
*NL*
woman
was
fitted
for
it
,
no
woman
ought
to
be
allowed
to
do
such
work
;
*NL*
if
the
world
could
not
keep
them
alive
any
other
way
it
ought
to
kill
*NL*
them
at
once
and
be
done
with
it
.
They
ought
not
to
marry
,
to
have
*NL*
children
;
no
workingman
ought
to
marry
--
if
he
,
Jurgis
,
had
known
what
a
*NL*
woman
was
like
,
he
would
have
had
his
eyes
torn
out
first
.
So
he
would
*NL*
carry
on
,
becoming
half
hysterical
himself
,
which
was
an
unbearable
*NL*
thing
to
see
in
a
big
man
;
Ona
would
pull
herself
together
and
fling
*NL*
herself
into
his
arms
,
begging
him
to
stop
,
to
be
still
,
that
she
would
*NL*
be
better
,
it
would
be
all
right
.
So
she
would
lie
and
sob
out
her
*NL*
grief
upon
his
shoulder
,
while
he
gazed
at
her
,
as
helpless
as
a
wounded
*NL*
animal
,
the
target
of
unseen
enemies
.

Chapter
15
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
beginning
of
these
perplexing
things
was
in
the
summer
;
and
each
*NL*
time
Ona
would
promise
him
with
terror
in
her
voice
that
it
would
not
*NL*
happen
again
--
but
in
vain
.
Each
crisis
would
leave
Jurgis
more
and
more
*NL*
frightened
,
more
disposed
to
distrust
Elzbieta
's
consolations
,
and
to
*NL*
believe
that
there
was
some
terrible
thing
about
all
this
that
he
was
*NL*
not
allowed
to
know
.
Once
or
twice
in
these
outbreaks
he
caught
Ona
's
*NL*
eye
,
and
it
seemed
to
him
like
the
eye
of
a
hunted
animal
;
there
were
*NL*
broken
phrases
of
anguish
and
despair
now
and
then
,
amid
her
frantic
*NL*
weeping
.
It
was
only
because
he
was
so
numb
and
beaten
himself
that
*NL*
Jurgis
did
not
worry
more
about
this
.
But
he
never
thought
of
it
,
except
*NL*
when
he
was
dragged
to
it
--
he
lived
like
a
dumb
beast
of
burden
,
knowing
*NL*
only
the
moment
in
which
he
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
winter
was
coming
on
again
,
more
menacing
and
cruel
than
ever
.
It
*NL*
was
October
,
and
the
holiday
rush
had
begun
.
It
was
necessary
for
the
*NL*
packing
machines
to
grind
till
late
at
night
to
provide
food
that
would
*NL*
be
eaten
at
Christmas
breakfasts
;
and
Marija
and
Elzbieta
and
Ona
,
as
*NL*
part
of
the
machine
,
began
working
fifteen
or
sixteen
hours
a
day
.
There
*NL*
was
no
choice
about
this
--
whatever
work
there
was
to
be
done
they
had
to
*NL*
do
,
if
they
wished
to
keep
their
places
;
besides
that
,
it
added
another
*NL*
pittance
to
their
incomes
.
So
they
staggered
on
with
the
awful
load
.
*NL*
They
would
start
work
every
morning
at
seven
,
and
eat
their
dinners
*NL*
at
noon
,
and
then
work
until
ten
or
eleven
at
night
without
another
*NL*
mouthful
of
food
.
Jurgis
wanted
to
wait
for
them
,
to
help
them
home
at
*NL*
night
,
but
they
would
not
think
of
this
;
the
fertilizer
mill
was
not
*NL*
running
overtime
,
and
there
was
no
place
for
him
to
wait
save
in
a
*NL*
saloon
.
Each
would
stagger
out
into
the
darkness
,
and
make
her
way
to
*NL*
the
corner
,
where
they
met
;
or
if
the
others
had
already
gone
,
would
get
*NL*
into
a
car
,
and
begin
a
painful
struggle
to
keep
awake
.
When
they
got
*NL*
home
they
were
always
too
tired
either
to
eat
or
to
undress
;
they
would
*NL*
crawl
into
bed
with
their
shoes
on
,
and
lie
like
logs
.
If
they
should
*NL*
fail
,
they
would
certainly
be
lost
;
if
they
held
out
,
they
might
have
*NL*
enough
coal
for
the
winter
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
day
or
two
before
Thanksgiving
Day
there
came
a
snowstorm
.
It
began
*NL*
in
the
afternoon
,
and
by
evening
two
inches
had
fallen
.
Jurgis
tried
*NL*
to
wait
for
the
women
,
but
went
into
a
saloon
to
get
warm
,
and
took
two
*NL*
drinks
,
and
came
out
and
ran
home
to
escape
from
the
demon
;
there
he
*NL*
lay
down
to
wait
for
them
,
and
instantly
fell
asleep
.
When
he
opened
*NL*
his
eyes
again
he
was
in
the
midst
of
a
nightmare
,
and
found
Elzbieta
*NL*
shaking
him
and
crying
out
.
At
first
he
could
not
realize
what
she
*NL*
was
saying
--
Ona
had
not
come
home
.
What
time
was
it
,
he
asked
.
It
was
*NL*
morning
--
time
to
be
up
.
Ona
had
not
been
home
that
night
!
And
it
was
*NL*
bitter
cold
,
and
a
foot
of
snow
on
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
sat
up
with
a
start
.
Marija
was
crying
with
fright
and
the
*NL*
children
were
wailing
in
sympathy
--
little
Stanislovas
in
addition
,
*NL*
because
the
terror
of
the
snow
was
upon
him
.
Jurgis
had
nothing
to
put
*NL*
on
but
his
shoes
and
his
coat
,
and
in
half
a
minute
he
was
out
of
the
*NL*
door
.
Then
,
however
,
he
realized
that
there
was
no
need
of
haste
,
that
*NL*
he
had
no
idea
where
to
go
.
It
was
still
dark
as
midnight
,
and
the
thick
*NL*
snowflakes
were
sifting
down
--
everything
was
so
silent
that
he
could
*NL*
hear
the
rustle
of
them
as
they
fell
.
In
the
few
seconds
that
he
stood
*NL*
there
hesitating
he
was
covered
white
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
set
off
at
a
run
for
the
yards
,
stopping
by
the
way
to
inquire
in
the
*NL*
saloons
that
were
open
.
Ona
might
have
been
overcome
on
the
way
;
or
else
*NL*
she
might
have
met
with
an
accident
in
the
machines
.
When
he
got
to
the
*NL*
place
where
she
worked
he
inquired
of
one
of
the
watchmen
--
there
had
*NL*
not
been
any
accident
,
so
far
as
the
man
had
heard
.
At
the
time
office
,
*NL*
which
he
found
already
open
,
the
clerk
told
him
that
Ona
's
check
had
*NL*
been
turned
in
the
night
before
,
showing
that
she
had
left
her
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
that
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
do
but
wait
,
pacing
back
and
*NL*
forth
in
the
snow
,
meantime
,
to
keep
from
freezing
.
Already
the
yards
*NL*
were
full
of
activity
;
cattle
were
being
unloaded
from
the
cars
in
the
*NL*
distance
,
and
across
the
way
the
``
beef-luggers
''
were
toiling
in
the
*NL*
darkness
,
carrying
two-hundred-pound
quarters
of
bullocks
into
the
*NL*
refrigerator
cars
.
Before
the
first
streaks
of
daylight
there
came
the
*NL*
crowding
throngs
of
workingmen
,
shivering
,
and
swinging
their
dinner
*NL*
pails
as
they
hurried
by
.
Jurgis
took
up
his
stand
by
the
time-office
*NL*
window
,
where
alone
there
was
light
enough
for
him
to
see
;
the
snow
fell
*NL*
so
quick
that
it
was
only
by
peering
closely
that
he
could
make
sure
*NL*
that
Ona
did
not
pass
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seven
o'clock
came
,
the
hour
when
the
great
packing
machine
began
to
*NL*
move
.
Jurgis
ought
to
have
been
at
his
place
in
the
fertilizer
mill
;
*NL*
but
instead
he
was
waiting
,
in
an
agony
of
fear
,
for
Ona
.
It
was
fifteen
*NL*
minutes
after
the
hour
when
he
saw
a
form
emerge
from
the
snow
mist
,
*NL*
and
sprang
toward
it
with
a
cry
.
It
was
she
,
running
swiftly
;
as
she
saw
*NL*
him
,
she
staggered
forward
,
and
half
fell
into
his
outstretched
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
has
been
the
matter
?
''
he
cried
,
anxiously
.
``
Where
have
you
been
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
several
seconds
before
she
could
get
breath
to
answer
him
.
``
I
*NL*
could
n't
get
home
,
''
she
exclaimed
.
``
The
snow
--
the
cars
had
stopped
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
where
were
you
then
?
''
he
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
to
go
home
with
a
friend
,
''
she
panted
--
``
with
Jadvyga
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
drew
a
deep
breath
;
but
then
he
noticed
that
she
was
sobbing
and
*NL*
trembling
--
as
if
in
one
of
those
nervous
crises
that
he
dreaded
so
.
``
But
*NL*
what
's
the
matter
?
''
he
cried
.
``
What
has
happened
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Jurgis
,
I
was
so
frightened
!
''
she
said
,
clinging
to
him
wildly
.
``
I
*NL*
have
been
so
worried
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
near
the
time
station
window
,
and
people
were
staring
at
them
.
*NL*
Jurgis
led
her
away
.
``
How
do
you
mean
?
''
he
asked
,
in
perplexity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
afraid
--
I
was
just
afraid
!
''
sobbed
Ona
.
``
I
knew
you
would
n't
know
*NL*
where
I
was
,
and
I
did
n't
know
what
you
might
do
.
I
tried
to
get
home
,
*NL*
but
I
was
so
tired
.
Oh
,
Jurgis
,
Jurgis
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
so
glad
to
get
her
back
that
he
could
not
think
clearly
about
*NL*
anything
else
.
It
did
not
seem
strange
to
him
that
she
should
be
so
very
*NL*
much
upset
;
all
her
fright
and
incoherent
protestations
did
not
matter
*NL*
since
he
had
her
back
.
He
let
her
cry
away
her
tears
;
and
then
,
because
*NL*
it
was
nearly
eight
o'clock
,
and
they
would
lose
another
hour
if
they
*NL*
delayed
,
he
left
her
at
the
packing
house
door
,
with
her
ghastly
white
*NL*
face
and
her
haunted
eyes
of
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
another
brief
interval
.
Christmas
was
almost
come
;
and
because
*NL*
the
snow
still
held
,
and
the
searching
cold
,
morning
after
morning
*NL*
Jurgis
half
carried
his
wife
to
her
post
,
staggering
with
her
through
*NL*
the
darkness
;
until
at
last
,
one
night
,
came
the
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
lacked
but
three
days
of
the
holidays
.
About
midnight
Marija
and
*NL*
Elzbieta
came
home
,
exclaiming
in
alarm
when
they
found
that
Ona
had
not
*NL*
come
.
The
two
had
agreed
to
meet
her
;
and
,
after
waiting
,
had
gone
to
*NL*
the
room
where
she
worked
;
only
to
find
that
the
ham-wrapping
girls
had
*NL*
quit
work
an
hour
before
,
and
left
.
There
was
no
snow
that
night
,
nor
*NL*
was
it
especially
cold
;
and
still
Ona
had
not
come
!
Something
more
*NL*
serious
must
be
wrong
this
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
aroused
Jurgis
,
and
he
sat
up
and
listened
crossly
to
the
story
.
*NL*
She
must
have
gone
home
again
with
Jadvyga
,
he
said
;
Jadvyga
lived
only
*NL*
two
blocks
from
the
yards
,
and
perhaps
she
had
been
tired
.
Nothing
could
*NL*
have
happened
to
her
--
and
even
if
there
had
,
there
was
nothing
could
*NL*
be
done
about
it
until
morning
.
Jurgis
turned
over
in
his
bed
,
and
was
*NL*
snoring
again
before
the
two
had
closed
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
,
however
,
he
was
up
and
out
nearly
an
hour
before
the
*NL*
usual
time
.
Jadvyga
Marcinkus
lived
on
the
other
side
of
the
yards
,
*NL*
beyond
Halsted
Street
,
with
her
mother
and
sisters
,
in
a
single
basement
*NL*
room
--
for
Mikolas
had
recently
lost
one
hand
from
blood
poisoning
,
and
*NL*
their
marriage
had
been
put
off
forever
.
The
door
of
the
room
was
in
the
*NL*
rear
,
reached
by
a
narrow
court
,
and
Jurgis
saw
a
light
in
the
window
*NL*
and
heard
something
frying
as
he
passed
;
he
knocked
,
half
expecting
that
*NL*
Ona
would
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Instead
there
was
one
of
Jadvyga
's
little
sisters
,
who
gazed
at
him
*NL*
through
a
crack
in
the
door
.
``
Where
's
Ona
?
''
he
demanded
;
and
the
child
*NL*
looked
at
him
in
perplexity
.
``
Ona
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Jurgis
,
``
is
n't
she
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
the
child
,
and
Jurgis
gave
a
start
.
A
moment
later
came
*NL*
Jadvyga
,
peering
over
the
child
's
head
.
When
she
saw
who
it
was
,
she
*NL*
slid
around
out
of
sight
,
for
she
was
not
quite
dressed
.
Jurgis
must
*NL*
excuse
her
,
she
began
,
her
mother
was
very
ill
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ona
is
n't
here
?
''
Jurgis
demanded
,
too
alarmed
to
wait
for
her
to
*NL*
finish
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
no
,
''
said
Jadvyga
.
``
What
made
you
think
she
would
be
here
?
Had
she
*NL*
said
she
was
coming
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
he
answered
.
``
But
she
has
n't
come
home
--
and
I
thought
she
would
be
*NL*
here
the
same
as
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
before
?
''
echoed
Jadvyga
,
in
perplexity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
time
she
spent
the
night
here
,
''
said
Jurgis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
must
be
some
mistake
,
''
she
answered
,
quickly
.
``
Ona
has
never
*NL*
spent
the
night
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
only
half
able
to
realize
the
words
.
``
Why
--
why
--
''
he
exclaimed
.
*NL*
``
Two
weeks
ago
.
Jadvyga
!
She
told
me
so
the
night
it
snowed
,
and
she
*NL*
could
not
get
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
must
be
some
mistake
,
''
declared
the
girl
,
again
;
``
she
did
n't
come
*NL*
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
steadied
himself
by
the
door-sill
;
and
Jadvyga
in
her
anxiety
--
for
*NL*
she
was
fond
of
Ona
--
opened
the
door
wide
,
holding
her
jacket
across
*NL*
her
throat
.
``
Are
you
sure
you
did
n't
misunderstand
her
?
''
she
cried
.
``
She
*NL*
must
have
meant
somewhere
else
.
She
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
said
here
,
''
insisted
Jurgis
.
``
She
told
me
all
about
you
,
and
how
*NL*
you
were
,
and
what
you
said
.
Are
you
sure
?
You
have
n't
forgotten
?
You
*NL*
were
n't
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
!
''
she
exclaimed
--
and
then
came
a
peevish
voice
--
``
Jadvyga
,
you
*NL*
are
giving
the
baby
a
cold
.
Shut
the
door
!
''
Jurgis
stood
for
half
a
*NL*
minute
more
,
stammering
his
perplexity
through
an
eighth
of
an
inch
of
*NL*
crack
;
and
then
,
as
there
was
really
nothing
more
to
be
said
,
he
excused
*NL*
himself
and
went
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
on
half
dazed
,
without
knowing
where
he
went
.
Ona
had
deceived
*NL*
him
!
She
had
lied
to
him
!
And
what
could
it
mean
--
where
had
she
been
?
*NL*
Where
was
she
now
?
He
could
hardly
grasp
the
thing
--
much
less
try
to
*NL*
solve
it
;
but
a
hundred
wild
surmises
came
to
him
,
a
sense
of
impending
*NL*
calamity
overwhelmed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Because
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
,
he
went
back
to
the
time
office
to
*NL*
watch
again
.
He
waited
until
nearly
an
hour
after
seven
,
and
then
went
*NL*
to
the
room
where
Ona
worked
to
make
inquiries
of
Ona
's
``
forelady
.
''
The
*NL*
``
forelady
,
''
he
found
,
had
not
yet
come
;
all
the
lines
of
cars
that
*NL*
came
from
downtown
were
stalled
--
there
had
been
an
accident
in
the
*NL*
powerhouse
,
and
no
cars
had
been
running
since
last
night
.
Meantime
,
*NL*
however
,
the
ham-wrappers
were
working
away
,
with
some
one
else
in
*NL*
charge
of
them
.
The
girl
who
answered
Jurgis
was
busy
,
and
as
she
*NL*
talked
she
looked
to
see
if
she
were
being
watched
.
Then
a
man
came
*NL*
up
,
wheeling
a
truck
;
he
knew
Jurgis
for
Ona
's
husband
,
and
was
curious
*NL*
about
the
mystery
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maybe
the
cars
had
something
to
do
with
it
,
''
he
suggested
--
``
maybe
she
*NL*
had
gone
down-town
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Jurgis
,
``
she
never
went
down-town
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
not
,
''
said
the
man
.
Jurgis
thought
he
saw
him
exchange
a
swift
*NL*
glance
with
the
girl
as
he
spoke
,
and
he
demanded
quickly
.
``
What
do
you
*NL*
know
about
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
man
had
seen
that
the
boss
was
watching
him
;
he
started
on
*NL*
again
,
pushing
his
truck
.
``
I
do
n't
know
anything
about
it
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
over
his
shoulder
.
``
How
should
I
know
where
your
wife
goes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Jurgis
went
out
again
and
paced
up
and
down
before
the
building
.
*NL*
All
the
morning
he
stayed
there
,
with
no
thought
of
his
work
.
About
*NL*
noon
he
went
to
the
police
station
to
make
inquiries
,
and
then
came
*NL*
back
again
for
another
anxious
vigil
.
Finally
,
toward
the
middle
of
the
*NL*
afternoon
,
he
set
out
for
home
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
walking
out
Ashland
Avenue
.
The
streetcars
had
begun
running
*NL*
again
,
and
several
passed
him
,
packed
to
the
steps
with
people
.
The
*NL*
sight
of
them
set
Jurgis
to
thinking
again
of
the
man
's
sarcastic
*NL*
remark
;
and
half
involuntarily
he
found
himself
watching
the
cars
--
with
*NL*
the
result
that
he
gave
a
sudden
startled
exclamation
,
and
stopped
short
*NL*
in
his
tracks
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
broke
into
a
run
.
For
a
whole
block
he
tore
after
the
car
,
only
*NL*
a
little
ways
behind
.
That
rusty
black
hat
with
the
drooping
red
flower
,
*NL*
it
might
not
be
Ona
's
,
but
there
was
very
little
likelihood
of
it
.
*NL*
He
would
know
for
certain
very
soon
,
for
she
would
get
out
two
blocks
*NL*
ahead
.
He
slowed
down
,
and
let
the
car
go
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
got
out
:
and
as
soon
as
she
was
out
of
sight
on
the
side
street
*NL*
Jurgis
broke
into
a
run
.
Suspicion
was
rife
in
him
now
,
and
he
was
not
*NL*
ashamed
to
shadow
her
:
he
saw
her
turn
the
corner
near
their
home
,
and
*NL*
then
he
ran
again
,
and
saw
her
as
she
went
up
the
porch
steps
of
the
*NL*
house
.
After
that
he
turned
back
,
and
for
five
minutes
paced
up
and
*NL*
down
,
his
hands
clenched
tightly
and
his
lips
set
,
his
mind
in
a
*NL*
turmoil
.
Then
he
went
home
and
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
opened
the
door
,
he
saw
Elzbieta
,
who
had
also
been
looking
for
*NL*
Ona
,
and
had
come
home
again
.
She
was
now
on
tiptoe
,
and
had
a
finger
on
*NL*
her
lips
.
Jurgis
waited
until
she
was
close
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
make
any
noise
,
''
she
whispered
,
hurriedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
'
?
''
he
asked
.
``
Ona
is
asleep
,
''
she
panted
.
``
She
's
been
*NL*
very
ill
.
I
'm
afraid
her
mind
's
been
wandering
,
Jurgis
.
She
was
lost
*NL*
on
the
street
all
night
,
and
I
've
only
just
succeeded
in
getting
her
*NL*
quiet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
did
she
come
in
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Soon
after
you
left
this
morning
,
''
said
Elzbieta
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
has
she
been
out
since
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
of
course
not
.
She
's
so
weak
,
Jurgis
,
she
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
set
his
teeth
hard
together
.
``
You
are
lying
to
me
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elzbieta
started
,
and
turned
pale
.
``
Why
!
''
she
gasped
.
``
What
do
you
*NL*
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Jurgis
did
not
answer
.
He
pushed
her
aside
,
and
strode
to
the
*NL*
bedroom
door
and
opened
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ona
was
sitting
on
the
bed
.
She
turned
a
startled
look
upon
him
as
he
*NL*
entered
.
He
closed
the
door
in
Elzbieta
's
face
,
and
went
toward
his
*NL*
wife
.
``
Where
have
you
been
?
''
he
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
her
hands
clasped
tightly
in
her
lap
,
and
he
saw
that
her
face
*NL*
was
as
white
as
paper
,
and
drawn
with
pain
.
She
gasped
once
or
twice
*NL*
as
she
tried
to
answer
him
,
and
then
began
,
speaking
low
,
and
swiftly
.
*NL*
``
Jurgis
,
I
--
I
think
I
have
been
out
of
my
mind
.
I
started
to
come
last
*NL*
night
,
and
I
could
not
find
the
way
.
I
walked
--
I
walked
all
night
,
I
*NL*
think
,
and
--
and
I
only
got
home
--
this
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
needed
a
rest
,
''
he
said
,
in
a
hard
tone
.
``
Why
did
you
go
out
*NL*
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
looking
her
fairly
in
the
face
,
and
he
could
read
the
sudden
fear
*NL*
and
wild
uncertainty
that
leaped
into
her
eyes
.
``
I
--
I
had
to
go
to
--
to
*NL*
the
store
,
''
she
gasped
,
almost
in
a
whisper
,
``
I
had
to
go
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
lying
to
me
,
''
said
Jurgis
.
Then
he
clenched
his
hands
and
took
*NL*
a
step
toward
her
.
``
Why
do
you
lie
to
me
?
''
he
cried
,
fiercely
.
``
What
are
*NL*
you
doing
that
you
have
to
lie
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jurgis
!
''
she
exclaimed
,
starting
up
in
fright
.
``
Oh
,
Jurgis
,
how
can
*NL*
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
lied
to
me
,
I
say
!
''
he
cried
.
``
You
told
me
you
had
been
to
*NL*
Jadvyga
's
house
that
other
night
,
and
you
had
n't
.
You
had
been
where
*NL*
you
were
last
night
--
somewheres
downtown
,
for
I
saw
you
get
off
the
car
.
*NL*
Where
were
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
as
if
he
had
struck
a
knife
into
her
.
She
seemed
to
go
all
to
*NL*
pieces
.
For
half
a
second
she
stood
,
reeling
and
swaying
,
staring
at
*NL*
him
with
horror
in
her
eyes
;
then
,
with
a
cry
of
anguish
,
she
tottered
*NL*
forward
,
stretching
out
her
arms
to
him
.
But
he
stepped
aside
,
*NL*
deliberately
,
and
let
her
fall
.
She
caught
herself
at
the
side
of
the
*NL*
bed
,
and
then
sank
down
,
burying
her
face
in
her
hands
and
bursting
into
*NL*
frantic
weeping
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
came
one
of
those
hysterical
crises
that
had
so
often
dismayed
*NL*
him
.
Ona
sobbed
and
wept
,
her
fear
and
anguish
building
themselves
up
*NL*
into
long
climaxes
.
Furious
gusts
of
emotion
would
come
sweeping
over
*NL*
her
,
shaking
her
as
the
tempest
shakes
the
trees
upon
the
hills
;
all
her
*NL*
frame
would
quiver
and
throb
with
them
--
it
was
as
if
some
dreadful
thing
*NL*
rose
up
within
her
and
took
possession
of
her
,
torturing
her
,
tearing
*NL*
her
.
This
thing
had
been
wont
to
set
Jurgis
quite
beside
himself
;
but
*NL*
now
he
stood
with
his
lips
set
tightly
and
his
hands
clenched
--
she
might
*NL*
weep
till
she
killed
herself
,
but
she
should
not
move
him
this
time
--
not
*NL*
an
inch
,
not
an
inch
.
Because
the
sounds
she
made
set
his
blood
to
*NL*
running
cold
and
his
lips
to
quivering
in
spite
of
himself
,
he
was
glad
*NL*
of
the
diversion
when
Teta
Elzbieta
,
pale
with
fright
,
opened
the
door
*NL*
and
rushed
in
;
yet
he
turned
upon
her
with
an
oath
.
``
Go
out
!
''
he
cried
,
*NL*
``
go
out
!
''
And
then
,
as
she
stood
hesitating
,
about
to
speak
,
he
seized
*NL*
her
by
the
arm
,
and
half
flung
her
from
the
room
,
slamming
the
door
*NL*
and
barring
it
with
a
table
.
Then
he
turned
again
and
faced
Ona
,
*NL*
crying
--
``
Now
,
answer
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
she
did
not
hear
him
--
she
was
still
in
the
grip
of
the
fiend
.
Jurgis
*NL*
could
see
her
outstretched
hands
,
shaking
and
twitching
,
roaming
*NL*
here
and
there
over
the
bed
at
will
,
like
living
things
;
he
could
see
*NL*
convulsive
shudderings
start
in
her
body
and
run
through
her
limbs
.
She
*NL*
was
sobbing
and
choking
--
it
was
as
if
there
were
too
many
sounds
for
one
*NL*
throat
,
they
came
chasing
each
other
,
like
waves
upon
the
sea
.
Then
her
*NL*
voice
would
begin
to
rise
into
screams
,
louder
and
louder
until
it
broke
*NL*
in
wild
,
horrible
peals
of
laughter
.
Jurgis
bore
it
until
he
could
bear
*NL*
it
no
longer
,
and
then
he
sprang
at
her
,
seizing
her
by
the
shoulders
*NL*
and
shaking
her
,
shouting
into
her
ear
:
``
Stop
it
,
I
say
!
Stop
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
up
at
him
,
out
of
her
agony
;
then
she
fell
forward
at
his
*NL*
feet
.
She
caught
them
in
her
hands
,
in
spite
of
his
efforts
to
step
*NL*
aside
,
and
with
her
face
upon
the
floor
lay
writhing
.
It
made
a
choking
*NL*
in
Jurgis
'
throat
to
hear
her
,
and
he
cried
again
,
more
savagely
than
*NL*
before
:
``
Stop
it
,
I
say
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
time
she
heeded
him
,
and
caught
her
breath
and
lay
silent
,
save
for
*NL*
the
gasping
sobs
that
wrenched
all
her
frame
.
For
a
long
minute
she
*NL*
lay
there
,
perfectly
motionless
,
until
a
cold
fear
seized
her
husband
,
*NL*
thinking
that
she
was
dying
.
Suddenly
,
however
,
he
heard
her
voice
,
*NL*
faintly
:
``
Jurgis
!
Jurgis
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
to
bend
down
to
her
,
she
was
so
weak
.
She
was
pleading
with
him
,
*NL*
in
broken
phrases
,
painfully
uttered
:
``
Have
faith
in
me
!
Believe
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Believe
what
?
''
he
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Believe
that
I
--
that
I
know
best
--
that
I
love
you
!
And
do
not
ask
*NL*
me
--
what
you
did
.
Oh
,
Jurgis
,
please
,
please
!
It
is
for
the
best
--
it
*NL*
is
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
started
to
speak
again
,
but
she
rushed
on
frantically
,
heading
him
*NL*
off
.
``
If
you
will
only
do
it
!
If
you
will
only
--
only
believe
me
!
*NL*
It
was
n't
my
fault
--
I
could
n't
help
it
--
it
will
be
all
right
--
it
is
*NL*
nothing
--
it
is
no
harm
.
Oh
,
Jurgis
--
please
,
please
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
hold
of
him
,
and
was
trying
to
raise
herself
to
look
at
him
;
he
*NL*
could
feel
the
palsied
shaking
of
her
hands
and
the
heaving
of
the
*NL*
bosom
she
pressed
against
him
.
She
managed
to
catch
one
of
his
hands
and
*NL*
gripped
it
convulsively
,
drawing
it
to
her
face
,
and
bathing
it
in
her
*NL*
tears
.
``
Oh
,
believe
me
,
believe
me
!
''
she
wailed
again
;
and
he
shouted
in
*NL*
fury
,
``
I
will
not
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
still
she
clung
to
him
,
wailing
aloud
in
her
despair
:
``
Oh
,
Jurgis
,
*NL*
think
what
you
are
doing
!
It
will
ruin
us
--
it
will
ruin
us
!
Oh
,
no
,
*NL*
you
must
not
do
it
!
No
,
do
n't
,
do
n't
do
it
.
You
must
not
do
it
!
It
*NL*
will
drive
me
mad
--
it
will
kill
me
--
no
,
no
,
Jurgis
,
I
am
crazy
--
it
is
*NL*
nothing
.
You
do
not
really
need
to
know
.
We
can
be
happy
--
we
can
love
*NL*
each
other
just
the
same
.
Oh
,
please
,
please
,
believe
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
words
fairly
drove
him
wild
.
He
tore
his
hands
loose
,
and
flung
her
*NL*
off
.
``
Answer
me
,
''
he
cried
.
``
God
damn
it
,
I
say
--
answer
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
sank
down
upon
the
floor
,
beginning
to
cry
again
.
It
was
like
*NL*
listening
to
the
moan
of
a
damned
soul
,
and
Jurgis
could
not
stand
it
.
*NL*
He
smote
his
fist
upon
the
table
by
his
side
,
and
shouted
again
at
her
,
*NL*
``
Answer
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
began
to
scream
aloud
,
her
voice
like
the
voice
of
some
wild
beast
:
*NL*
``
Ah
!
Ah
!
I
ca
n't
!
I
ca
n't
do
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
ca
n't
you
do
it
?
''
he
shouted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
how
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
sprang
and
caught
her
by
the
arm
,
lifting
her
up
,
and
glaring
into
*NL*
her
face
.
``
Tell
me
where
you
were
last
night
!
''
he
panted
.
``
Quick
,
out
*NL*
with
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
began
to
whisper
,
one
word
at
a
time
:
``
I
--
was
in
--
a
*NL*
house
--
downtown
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
house
?
What
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
tried
to
hide
her
eyes
away
,
but
he
held
her
.
``
Miss
Henderson
's
*NL*
house
,
''
she
gasped
.
He
did
not
understand
at
first
.
``
Miss
Henderson
's
*NL*
house
,
''
he
echoed
.
And
then
suddenly
,
as
in
an
explosion
,
the
horrible
*NL*
truth
burst
over
him
,
and
he
reeled
and
staggered
back
with
a
scream
.
*NL*
He
caught
himself
against
the
wall
,
and
put
his
hand
to
his
forehead
,
*NL*
staring
about
him
,
and
whispering
,
``
Jesus
!
Jesus
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
An
instant
later
he
leaped
at
her
,
as
she
lay
groveling
at
his
feet
.
*NL*
He
seized
her
by
the
throat
.
``
Tell
me
!
''
he
gasped
,
hoarsely
.
``
Quick
!
*NL*
Who
took
you
to
that
place
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
tried
to
get
away
,
making
him
furious
;
he
thought
it
was
fear
,
of
*NL*
the
pain
of
his
clutch
--
he
did
not
understand
that
it
was
the
agony
of
*NL*
her
shame
.
Still
she
answered
him
,
``
Connor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Connor
,
''
he
gasped
.
``
Who
is
Connor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
boss
,
''
she
answered
.
``
The
man
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
tightened
his
grip
,
in
his
frenzy
,
and
only
when
he
saw
her
eyes
*NL*
closing
did
he
realize
that
he
was
choking
her
.
Then
he
relaxed
his
*NL*
fingers
,
and
crouched
,
waiting
,
until
she
opened
her
lids
again
.
His
*NL*
breath
beat
hot
into
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
,
''
he
whispered
,
at
last
,
``
tell
me
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
lay
perfectly
motionless
,
and
he
had
to
hold
his
breath
to
catch
her
*NL*
words
.
``
I
did
not
want
--
to
do
it
,
''
she
said
;
``
I
tried
--
I
tried
not
to
do
*NL*
it
.
I
only
did
it
--
to
save
us
.
It
was
our
only
chance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
,
for
a
space
,
there
was
no
sound
but
his
panting
.
Ona
's
eyes
*NL*
closed
and
when
she
spoke
again
she
did
not
open
them
.
``
He
told
me
--
he
*NL*
would
have
me
turned
off
.
He
told
me
he
would
--
we
would
all
of
us
lose
*NL*
our
places
.
We
could
never
get
anything
to
do
--
here
--
again
.
He
--
he
meant
*NL*
it
--
he
would
have
ruined
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
'
arms
were
shaking
so
that
he
could
scarcely
hold
himself
up
,
*NL*
and
lurched
forward
now
and
then
as
he
listened
.
``
When
--
when
did
this
*NL*
begin
?
''
he
gasped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
the
very
first
,
''
she
said
.
She
spoke
as
if
in
a
trance
.
``
It
was
*NL*
all
--
it
was
their
plot
--
Miss
Henderson
's
plot
.
She
hated
me
.
And
he
--
he
*NL*
wanted
me
.
He
used
to
speak
to
me
--
out
on
the
platform
.
Then
he
began
*NL*
to
--
to
make
love
to
me
.
He
offered
me
money
.
He
begged
me
--
he
said
he
*NL*
loved
me
.
Then
he
threatened
me
.
He
knew
all
about
us
,
he
knew
we
would
*NL*
starve
.
He
knew
your
boss
--
he
knew
Marija
's
.
He
would
hound
us
to
death
,
*NL*
he
said
--
then
he
said
if
I
would
--
if
I
--
we
would
all
of
us
be
sure
*NL*
of
work
--
always
.
Then
one
day
he
caught
hold
of
me
--
he
would
not
let
*NL*
go
--
he
--
he
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
was
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
hallway
--
at
night

after
every
one
had
gone
.
I
could
not
help
*NL*
it
.
I
thought
of
you
--
of
the
baby
--
of
mother
and
the
children
.
I
was
*NL*
afraid
of
him
--
afraid
to
cry
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
moment
ago
her
face
had
been
ashen
gray
,
now
it
was
scarlet
.
She
was
*NL*
beginning
to
breathe
hard
again
.
Jurgis
made
not
a
sound
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
two
months
ago
.
Then
he
wanted
me
to
come
--
to
that
house
.
He
*NL*
wanted
me
to
stay
there
.
He
said
all
of
us
--
that
we
would
not
have
to
*NL*
work
.
He
made
me
come
there
--
in
the
evenings
.
I
told
you
--
you
thought
I
*NL*
was
at
the
factory
.
Then
--
one
night
it
snowed
,
and
I
could
n't
get
back
.
*NL*
And
last
night
--
the
cars
were
stopped
.
It
was
such
a
little
thing
--
to
*NL*
ruin
us
all
.
I
tried
to
walk
,
but
I
could
n't
.
I
did
n't
want
you
to
know
.
*NL*
It
would
have
--
it
would
have
been
all
right
.
We
could
have
gone
on
--
just
*NL*
the
same
--
you
need
never
have
known
about
it
.
He
was
getting
tired
of
*NL*
me
--
he
would
have
let
me
alone
soon
.
I
am
going
to
have
a
baby
--
I
am
*NL*
getting
ugly
.
He
told
me
that
--
twice
,
he
told
me
,
last
night
.
He
kicked
*NL*
me
--
last
night
--
too
.
And
now
you
will
kill
him
--
you
--
you
will
kill
*NL*
him
--
and
we
shall
die
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
she
had
said
without
a
quiver
;
she
lay
still
as
death
,
not
an
*NL*
eyelid
moving
.
And
Jurgis
,
too
,
said
not
a
word
.
He
lifted
himself
by
*NL*
the
bed
,
and
stood
up
.
He
did
not
stop
for
another
glance
at
her
,
but
*NL*
went
to
the
door
and
opened
it
.
He
did
not
see
Elzbieta
,
crouching
*NL*
terrified
in
the
corner
.
He
went
out
,
hatless
,
leaving
the
street
door
*NL*
open
behind
him
.
The
instant
his
feet
were
on
the
sidewalk
he
broke
into
*NL*
a
run
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
ran
like
one
possessed
,
blindly
,
furiously
,
looking
neither
to
the
*NL*
right
nor
left
.
He
was
on
Ashland
Avenue
before
exhaustion
compelled
him
*NL*
to
slow
down
,
and
then
,
noticing
a
car
,
he
made
a
dart
for
it
and
drew
*NL*
himself
aboard
.
His
eyes
were
wild
and
his
hair
flying
,
and
he
was
*NL*
breathing
hoarsely
,
like
a
wounded
bull
;
but
the
people
on
the
car
did
*NL*
not
notice
this
particularly
--
perhaps
it
seemed
natural
to
them
that
*NL*
a
man
who
smelled
as
Jurgis
smelled
should
exhibit
an
aspect
to
*NL*
correspond
.
They
began
to
give
way
before
him
as
usual
.
The
conductor
*NL*
took
his
nickel
gingerly
,
with
the
tips
of
his
fingers
,
and
then
left
*NL*
him
with
the
platform
to
himself
.
Jurgis
did
not
even
notice
it
--
his
*NL*
thoughts
were
far
away
.
Within
his
soul
it
was
like
a
roaring
furnace
;
*NL*
he
stood
waiting
,
waiting
,
crouching
as
if
for
a
spring
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
some
of
his
breath
back
when
the
car
came
to
the
entrance
of
the
*NL*
yards
,
and
so
he
leaped
off
and
started
again
,
racing
at
full
speed
.
*NL*
People
turned
and
stared
at
him
,
but
he
saw
no
one
--
there
was
the
*NL*
factory
,
and
he
bounded
through
the
doorway
and
down
the
corridor
.
He
*NL*
knew
the
room
where
Ona
worked
,
and
he
knew
Connor
,
the
boss
of
the
*NL*
loading-gang
outside
.
He
looked
for
the
man
as
he
sprang
into
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
truckmen
were
hard
at
work
,
loading
the
freshly
packed
boxes
and
*NL*
barrels
upon
the
cars
.
Jurgis
shot
one
swift
glance
up
and
down
the
*NL*
platform
--
the
man
was
not
on
it
.
But
then
suddenly
he
heard
a
voice
in
*NL*
the
corridor
,
and
started
for
it
with
a
bound
.
In
an
instant
more
he
*NL*
fronted
the
boss
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
big
,
red-faced
Irishman
,
coarse-featured
,
and
smelling
of
*NL*
liquor
.
He
saw
Jurgis
as
he
crossed
the
threshold
,
and
turned
white
.
*NL*
He
hesitated
one
second
,
as
if
meaning
to
run
;
and
in
the
next
his
*NL*
assailant
was
upon
him
.
He
put
up
his
hands
to
protect
his
face
,
but
*NL*
Jurgis
,
lunging
with
all
the
power
of
his
arm
and
body
,
struck
him
*NL*
fairly
between
the
eyes
and
knocked
him
backward
.
The
next
moment
he
was
*NL*
on
top
of
him
,
burying
his
fingers
in
his
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
Jurgis
this
man
's
whole
presence
reeked
of
the
crime
he
had
*NL*
committed
;
the
touch
of
his
body
was
madness
to
him
--
it
set
every
nerve
*NL*
of
him
a-tremble
,
it
aroused
all
the
demon
in
his
soul
.
It
had
worked
its
*NL*
will
upon
Ona
,
this
great
beast
--
and
now
he
had
it
,
he
had
it
!
It
was
*NL*
his
turn
now
!
Things
swam
blood
before
him
,
and
he
screamed
aloud
in
his
*NL*
fury
,
lifting
his
victim
and
smashing
his
head
upon
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
place
,
of
course
,
was
in
an
uproar
;
women
fainting
and
shrieking
,
*NL*
and
men
rushing
in
.
Jurgis
was
so
bent
upon
his
task
that
he
knew
*NL*
nothing
of
this
,
and
scarcely
realized
that
people
were
trying
to
*NL*
interfere
with
him
;
it
was
only
when
half
a
dozen
men
had
seized
him
by
*NL*
the
legs
and
shoulders
and
were
pulling
at
him
,
that
he
understood
that
*NL*
he
was
losing
his
prey
.
In
a
flash
he
had
bent
down
and
sunk
his
teeth
*NL*
into
the
man
's
cheek
;
and
when
they
tore
him
away
he
was
dripping
with
*NL*
blood
,
and
little
ribbons
of
skin
were
hanging
in
his
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
got
him
down
upon
the
floor
,
clinging
to
him
by
his
arms
and
legs
,
*NL*
and
still
they
could
hardly
hold
him
.
He
fought
like
a
tiger
,
*NL*
writhing
and
twisting
,
half
flinging
them
off
,
and
starting
toward
his
*NL*
unconscious
enemy
.
But
yet
others
rushed
in
,
until
there
was
a
little
*NL*
mountain
of
twisted
limbs
and
bodies
,
heaving
and
tossing
,
and
working
*NL*
its
way
about
the
room
.
In
the
end
,
by
their
sheer
weight
,
they
choked
*NL*
the
breath
out
of
him
,
and
then
they
carried
him
to
the
company
police
*NL*
station
,
where
he
lay
still
until
they
had
summoned
a
patrol
wagon
to
*NL*
take
him
away
.

When
Jurgis
got
up
again
he
went
quietly
enough
.
He
was
exhausted
and
*NL*
half-dazed
,
and
besides
he
saw
the
blue
uniforms
of
the
policemen
.
He
*NL*
drove
in
a
patrol
wagon
with
half
a
dozen
of
them
watching
him
;
keeping
*NL*
as
far
away
as
possible
,
however
,
on
account
of
the
fertilizer
.
Then
he
*NL*
stood
before
the
sergeant
's
desk
and
gave
his
name
and
address
,
and
saw
*NL*
a
charge
of
assault
and
battery
entered
against
him
.
On
his
way
to
his
*NL*
cell
a
burly
policeman
cursed
him
because
he
started
down
the
*NL*
wrong
corridor
,
and
then
added
a
kick
when
he
was
not
quick
enough
;
*NL*
nevertheless
,
Jurgis
did
not
even
lift
his
eyes
--
he
had
lived
two
years
*NL*
and
a
half
in
Packingtown
,
and
he
knew
what
the
police
were
.
It
was
as
*NL*
much
as
a
man
's
very
life
was
worth
to
anger
them
,
here
in
their
inmost
*NL*
lair
;
like
as
not
a
dozen
would
pile
on
to
him
at
once
,
and
pound
*NL*
his
face
into
a
pulp
.
It
would
be
nothing
unusual
if
he
got
his
skull
*NL*
cracked
in
the
melee
--
in
which
case
they
would
report
that
he
had
*NL*
been
drunk
and
had
fallen
down
,
and
there
would
be
no
one
to
know
the
*NL*
difference
or
to
care
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
a
barred
door
clanged
upon
Jurgis
and
he
sat
down
upon
a
bench
and
*NL*
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
.
He
was
alone
;
he
had
the
afternoon
and
all
*NL*
of
the
night
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
he
was
like
a
wild
beast
that
has
glutted
itself
;
he
was
in
*NL*
a
dull
stupor
of
satisfaction
.
He
had
done
up
the
scoundrel
pretty
*NL*
well
--
not
as
well
as
he
would
have
if
they
had
given
him
a
minute
*NL*
more
,
but
pretty
well
,
all
the
same
;
the
ends
of
his
fingers
were
still
*NL*
tingling
from
their
contact
with
the
fellow
's
throat
.
But
then
,
little
*NL*
by
little
,
as
his
strength
came
back
and
his
senses
cleared
,
he
began
*NL*
to
see
beyond
his
momentary
gratification
;
that
he
had
nearly
killed
*NL*
the
boss
would
not
help
Ona
--
not
the
horrors
that
she
had
borne
,
nor
the
*NL*
memory
that
would
haunt
her
all
her
days
.
It
would
not
help
to
feed
her
*NL*
and
her
child
;
she
would
certainly
lose
her
place
,
while
he
--
what
was
to
*NL*
happen
to
him
God
only
knew
.
*NL*
*NL*
Half
the
night
he
paced
the
floor
,
wrestling
with
this
nightmare
;
and
*NL*
when
he
was
exhausted
he
lay
down
,
trying
to
sleep
,
but
finding
instead
,
*NL*
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
,
that
his
brain
was
too
much
for
him
.
In
*NL*
the
cell
next
to
him
was
a
drunken
wife-beater
and
in
the
one
beyond
*NL*
a
yelling
maniac
.
At
midnight
they
opened
the
station
house
to
the
*NL*
homeless
wanderers
who
were
crowded
about
the
door
,
shivering
in
the
*NL*
winter
blast
,
and
they
thronged
into
the
corridor
outside
of
the
cells
.
*NL*
Some
of
them
stretched
themselves
out
on
the
bare
stone
floor
and
fell
*NL*
to
snoring
,
others
sat
up
,
laughing
and
talking
,
cursing
and
quarreling
.
*NL*
The
air
was
fetid
with
their
breath
,
yet
in
spite
of
this
some
of
them
*NL*
smelled
Jurgis
and
called
down
the
torments
of
hell
upon
him
,
while
he
*NL*
lay
in
a
far
corner
of
his
cell
,
counting
the
throbbings
of
the
blood
in
*NL*
his
forehead
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
brought
him
his
supper
,
which
was
``
duffers
and
dope
''
--
being
*NL*
hunks
of
dry
bread
on
a
tin
plate
,
and
coffee
,
called
``
dope
''
because
it
*NL*
was
drugged
to
keep
the
prisoners
quiet
.
Jurgis
had
not
known
this
,
or
*NL*
he
would
have
swallowed
the
stuff
in
desperation
;
as
it
was
,
every
nerve
*NL*
of
him
was
a-quiver
with
shame
and
rage
.
Toward
morning
the
place
fell
*NL*
silent
,
and
he
got
up
and
began
to
pace
his
cell
;
and
then
within
the
*NL*
soul
of
him
there
rose
up
a
fiend
,
red-eyed
and
cruel
,
and
tore
out
the
*NL*
strings
of
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
for
himself
that
he
suffered
--
what
did
a
man
who
worked
in
*NL*
Durham
's
fertilizer
mill
care
about
anything
that
the
world
might
do
*NL*
to
him
!
What
was
any
tyranny
of
prison
compared
with
the
tyranny
of
the
*NL*
past
,
of
the
thing
that
had
happened
and
could
not
be
recalled
,
of
the
*NL*
memory
that
could
never
be
effaced
!
The
horror
of
it
drove
him
mad
;
*NL*
he
stretched
out
his
arms
to
heaven
,
crying
out
for
deliverance
from
*NL*
it
--
and
there
was
no
deliverance
,
there
was
no
power
even
in
heaven
that
*NL*
could
undo
the
past
.
It
was
a
ghost
that
would
not
drown
;
it
followed
*NL*
him
,
it
seized
upon
him
and
beat
him
to
the
ground
.
Ah
,
if
only
he
could
*NL*
have
foreseen
it
--
but
then
,
he
would
have
foreseen
it
,
if
he
had
not
*NL*
been
a
fool
!
He
smote
his
hands
upon
his
forehead
,
cursing
himself
*NL*
because
he
had
ever
allowed
Ona
to
work
where
she
had
,
because
he
had
*NL*
not
stood
between
her
and
a
fate
which
every
one
knew
to
be
so
common
.
*NL*
He
should
have
taken
her
away
,
even
if
it
were
to
lie
down
and
die
of
*NL*
starvation
in
the
gutters
of
Chicago
's
streets
!
And
now
--
oh
,
it
could
*NL*
not
be
true
;
it
was
too
monstrous
,
too
horrible
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
thing
that
could
not
be
faced
;
a
new
shuddering
seized
him
*NL*
every
time
he
tried
to
think
of
it
.
No
,
there
was
no
bearing
the
load
of
*NL*
it
,
there
was
no
living
under
it
.
There
would
be
none
for
her
--
he
knew
*NL*
that
he
might
pardon
her
,
might
plead
with
her
on
his
knees
,
but
she
*NL*
would
never
look
him
in
the
face
again
,
she
would
never
be
his
*NL*
wife
again
.
The
shame
of
it
would
kill
her
--
there
could
be
no
other
*NL*
deliverance
,
and
it
was
best
that
she
should
die
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
simple
and
clear
,
and
yet
,
with
cruel
inconsistency
,
whenever
*NL*
he
escaped
from
this
nightmare
it
was
to
suffer
and
cry
out
at
the
*NL*
vision
of
Ona
starving
.
They
had
put
him
in
jail
,
and
they
would
keep
*NL*
him
here
a
long
time
,
years
maybe
.
And
Ona
would
surely
not
go
to
work
*NL*
again
,
broken
and
crushed
as
she
was
.
And
Elzbieta
and
Marija
,
too
,
*NL*
might
lose
their
places
--
if
that
hell
fiend
Connor
chose
to
set
to
work
*NL*
to
ruin
them
,
they
would
all
be
turned
out
.
And
even
if
he
did
not
,
they
*NL*
could
not
live
--
even
if
the
boys
left
school
again
,
they
could
surely
*NL*
not
pay
all
the
bills
without
him
and
Ona
.
They
had
only
a
few
dollars
*NL*
now
--
they
had
just
paid
the
rent
of
the
house
a
week
ago
,
and
that
after
*NL*
it
was
two
weeks
overdue
.
So
it
would
be
due
again
in
a
week
!
They
would
*NL*
have
no
money
to
pay
it
then
--
and
they
would
lose
the
house
,
after
all
*NL*
their
long
,
heartbreaking
struggle
.
Three
times
now
the
agent
had
warned
*NL*
him
that
he
would
not
tolerate
another
delay
.
Perhaps
it
was
very
*NL*
base
of
Jurgis
to
be
thinking
about
the
house
when
he
had
the
other
*NL*
unspeakable
thing
to
fill
his
mind
;
yet
,
how
much
he
had
suffered
for
*NL*
this
house
,
how
much
they
had
all
of
them
suffered
!
It
was
their
one
*NL*
hope
of
respite
,
as
long
as
they
lived
;
they
had
put
all
their
money
*NL*
into
it
--
and
they
were
working
people
,
poor
people
,
whose
money
was
*NL*
their
strength
,
the
very
substance
of
them
,
body
and
soul
,
the
thing
by
*NL*
which
they
lived
and
for
lack
of
which
they
died
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
they
would
lose
it
all
;
they
would
be
turned
out
into
the
streets
,
*NL*
and
have
to
hide
in
some
icy
garret
,
and
live
or
die
as
best
they
could
!
*NL*
Jurgis
had
all
the
night
--
and
all
of
many
more
nights
--
to
think
about
*NL*
this
,
and
he
saw
the
thing
in
its
details
;
he
lived
it
all
,
as
if
he
*NL*
were
there
.
They
would
sell
their
furniture
,
and
then
run
into
debt
at
*NL*
the
stores
,
and
then
be
refused
credit
;
they
would
borrow
a
little
from
*NL*
the
Szedvilases
,
whose
delicatessen
store
was
tottering
on
the
brink
*NL*
of
ruin
;
the
neighbors
would
come
and
help
them
a
little
--
poor
,
sick
*NL*
Jadvyga
would
bring
a
few
spare
pennies
,
as
she
always
did
when
people
*NL*
were
starving
,
and
Tamoszius
Kuszleika
would
bring
them
the
proceeds
of
*NL*
a
night
's
fiddling
.
So
they
would
struggle
to
hang
on
until
he
got
out
*NL*
of
jail
--
or
would
they
know
that
he
was
in
jail
,
would
they
be
able
to
*NL*
find
out
anything
about
him
?
Would
they
be
allowed
to
see
him
--
or
was
it
*NL*
to
be
part
of
his
punishment
to
be
kept
in
ignorance
about
their
fate
?
*NL*
*NL*
His
mind
would
hang
upon
the
worst
possibilities
;
he
saw
Ona
ill
and
*NL*
tortured
,
Marija
out
of
her
place
,
little
Stanislovas
unable
to
get
*NL*
to
work
for
the
snow
,
the
whole
family
turned
out
on
the
street
.
God
*NL*
Almighty
!
would
they
actually
let
them
lie
down
in
the
street
and
die
?
*NL*
Would
there
be
no
help
even
then
--
would
they
wander
about
in
the
snow
*NL*
till
they
froze
?
Jurgis
had
never
seen
any
dead
bodies
in
the
streets
,
*NL*
but
he
had
seen
people
evicted
and
disappear
,
no
one
knew
where
;
*NL*
and
though
the
city
had
a
relief
bureau
,
though
there
was
a
charity
*NL*
organization
society
in
the
stockyards
district
,
in
all
his
life
there
*NL*
he
had
never
heard
of
either
of
them
.
They
did
not
advertise
their
*NL*
activities
,
having
more
calls
than
they
could
attend
to
without
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
So
on
until
morning
.
Then
he
had
another
ride
in
the
patrol
wagon
,
*NL*
along
with
the
drunken
wife-beater
and
the
maniac
,
several
``
plain
*NL*
drunks
''
and
``
saloon
fighters
,
''
a
burglar
,
and
two
men
who
had
been
*NL*
arrested
for
stealing
meat
from
the
packing
houses
.
Along
with
them
he
*NL*
was
driven
into
a
large
,
white-walled
room
,
stale-smelling
and
*NL*
crowded
.
In
front
,
upon
a
raised
platform
behind
a
rail
,
sat
a
stout
,
*NL*
florid-faced
personage
,
with
a
nose
broken
out
in
purple
blotches
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
friend
realized
vaguely
that
he
was
about
to
be
tried
.
He
wondered
*NL*
what
for
--
whether
or
not
his
victim
might
be
dead
,
and
if
so
,
what
they
*NL*
would
do
with
him
.
Hang
him
,
perhaps
,
or
beat
him
to
death
--
nothing
*NL*
would
have
surprised
Jurgis
,
who
knew
little
of
the
laws
.
Yet
he
had
*NL*
picked
up
gossip
enough
to
have
it
occur
to
him
that
the
loud-voiced
man
*NL*
upon
the
bench
might
be
the
notorious
Justice
Callahan
,
about
whom
the
*NL*
people
of
Packingtown
spoke
with
bated
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pat
''
Callahan
--
``
Growler
''
Pat
,
as
he
had
been
known
before
he
ascended
*NL*
the
bench
--
had
begun
life
as
a
butcher
boy
and
a
bruiser
of
local
*NL*
reputation
;
he
had
gone
into
politics
almost
as
soon
as
he
had
learned
*NL*
to
talk
,
and
had
held
two
offices
at
once
before
he
was
old
enough
to
*NL*
vote
.
If
Scully
was
the
thumb
,
Pat
Callahan
was
the
first
finger
of
the
*NL*
unseen
hand
whereby
the
packers
held
down
the
people
of
the
district
.
No
*NL*
politician
in
Chicago
ranked
higher
in
their
confidence
;
he
had
been
at
*NL*
it
a
long
time
--
had
been
the
business
agent
in
the
city
council
of
old
*NL*
Durham
,
the
self-made
merchant
,
way
back
in
the
early
days
,
when
the
*NL*
whole
city
of
Chicago
had
been
up
at
auction
.
``
Growler
''
Pat
had
given
*NL*
up
holding
city
offices
very
early
in
his
career
--
caring
only
for
party
*NL*
power
,
and
giving
the
rest
of
his
time
to
superintending
his
dives
and
*NL*
brothels
.
Of
late
years
,
however
,
since
his
children
were
growing
up
,
*NL*
he
had
begun
to
value
respectability
,
and
had
had
himself
made
a
*NL*
magistrate
;
a
position
for
which
he
was
admirably
fitted
,
because
of
his
*NL*
strong
conservatism
and
his
contempt
for
``
foreigners
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
sat
gazing
about
the
room
for
an
hour
or
two
;
he
was
in
hopes
*NL*
that
some
one
of
the
family
would
come
,
but
in
this
he
was
disappointed
.
*NL*
Finally
,
he
was
led
before
the
bar
,
and
a
lawyer
for
the
company
*NL*
appeared
against
him
.
Connor
was
under
the
doctor
's
care
,
the
lawyer
*NL*
explained
briefly
,
and
if
his
Honor
would
hold
the
prisoner
for
a
*NL*
week
--
``
Three
hundred
dollars
,
''
said
his
Honor
,
promptly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
was
staring
from
the
judge
to
the
lawyer
in
perplexity
.
``
Have
you
*NL*
any
one
to
go
on
your
bond
?
''
demanded
the
judge
,
and
then
a
clerk
who
*NL*
stood
at
Jurgis
'
elbow
explained
to
him
what
this
meant
.
The
latter
*NL*
shook
his
head
,
and
before
he
realized
what
had
happened
the
policemen
*NL*
were
leading
him
away
again
.
They
took
him
to
a
room
where
other
*NL*
prisoners
were
waiting
and
here
he
stayed
until
court
adjourned
,
when
he
*NL*
had
another
long
and
bitterly
cold
ride
in
a
patrol
wagon
to
the
county
*NL*
jail
,
which
is
on
the
north
side
of
the
city
,
and
nine
or
ten
miles
from
*NL*
the
stockyards
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
they
searched
Jurgis
,
leaving
him
only
his
money
,
which
consisted
*NL*
of
fifteen
cents
.
Then
they
led
him
to
a
room
and
told
him
to
strip
for
*NL*
a
bath
;
after
which
he
had
to
walk
down
a
long
gallery
,
past
the
grated
*NL*
cell
doors
of
the
inmates
of
the
jail
.
This
was
a
great
event
to
the
*NL*
latter
--
the
daily
review
of
the
new
arrivals
,
all
stark
naked
,
and
many
*NL*
and
diverting
were
the
comments
.
Jurgis
was
required
to
stay
in
the
bath
*NL*
longer
than
any
one
,
in
the
vain
hope
of
getting
out
of
him
a
few
of
his
*NL*
phosphates
and
acids
.
The
prisoners
roomed
two
in
a
cell
,
but
that
day
*NL*
there
was
one
left
over
,
and
he
was
the
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cells
were
in
tiers
,
opening
upon
galleries
.
His
cell
was
about
five
*NL*
feet
by
seven
in
size
,
with
a
stone
floor
and
a
heavy
wooden
bench
built
*NL*
into
it
.
There
was
no
window
--
the
only
light
came
from
windows
near
the
*NL*
roof
at
one
end
of
the
court
outside
.
There
were
two
bunks
,
one
above
*NL*
the
other
,
each
with
a
straw
mattress
and
a
pair
of
gray
blankets
--
the
*NL*
latter
stiff
as
boards
with
filth
,
and
alive
with
fleas
,
bedbugs
,
and
*NL*
lice
.
When
Jurgis
lifted
up
the
mattress
he
discovered
beneath
it
a
*NL*
layer
of
scurrying
roaches
,
almost
as
badly
frightened
as
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
they
brought
him
more
``
duffers
and
dope
,
''
with
the
addition
of
a
*NL*
bowl
of
soup
.
Many
of
the
prisoners
had
their
meals
brought
in
from
a
*NL*
restaurant
,
but
Jurgis
had
no
money
for
that
.
Some
had
books
to
read
and
*NL*
cards
to
play
,
with
candles
to
burn
by
night
,
but
Jurgis
was
all
alone
*NL*
in
darkness
and
silence
.
He
could
not
sleep
again
;
there
was
the
same
*NL*
maddening
procession
of
thoughts
that
lashed
him
like
whips
upon
his
*NL*
naked
back
.
When
night
fell
he
was
pacing
up
and
down
his
cell
like
a
*NL*
wild
beast
that
breaks
its
teeth
upon
the
bars
of
its
cage
.
Now
and
then
*NL*
in
his
frenzy
he
would
fling
himself
against
the
walls
of
the
place
,
*NL*
beating
his
hands
upon
them
.
They
cut
him
and
bruised
him
--
they
were
*NL*
cold
and
merciless
as
the
men
who
had
built
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
distance
there
was
a
church-tower
bell
that
tolled
the
hours
one
*NL*
by
one
.
When
it
came
to
midnight
Jurgis
was
lying
upon
the
floor
with
*NL*
his
head
in
his
arms
,
listening
.
Instead
of
falling
silent
at
the
end
,
*NL*
the
bell
broke
into
a
sudden
clangor
.
Jurgis
raised
his
head
;
what
could
*NL*
that
mean
--
a
fire
?
God
!
Suppose
there
were
to
be
a
fire
in
this
jail
!
*NL*
But
then
he
made
out
a
melody
in
the
ringing
;
there
were
chimes
.
And
*NL*
they
seemed
to
waken
the
city
--
all
around
,
far
and
near
,
there
were
*NL*
bells
,
ringing
wild
music
;
for
fully
a
minute
Jurgis
lay
lost
in
wonder
,
*NL*
before
,
all
at
once
,
the
meaning
of
it
broke
over
him
--
that
this
was
*NL*
Christmas
Eve
!
*NL*
*NL*
Christmas
Eve
--
he
had
forgotten
it
entirely
!
There
was
a
breaking
of
*NL*
floodgates
,
a
whirl
of
new
memories
and
new
griefs
rushing
into
his
*NL*
mind
.
In
far
Lithuania
they
had
celebrated
Christmas
;
and
it
came
to
*NL*
him
as
if
it
had
been
yesterday
--
himself
a
little
child
,
with
his
lost
*NL*
brother
and
his
dead
father
in
the
cabin
--
in
the
deep
black
forest
,
*NL*
where
the
snow
fell
all
day
and
all
night
and
buried
them
from
the
*NL*
world
.
It
was
too
far
off
for
Santa
Claus
in
Lithuania
,
but
it
was
not
*NL*
too
far
for
peace
and
good
will
to
men
,
for
the
wonder-bearing
vision
*NL*
of
the
Christ
Child
.
And
even
in
Packingtown
they
had
not
forgotten
*NL*
it
--
some
gleam
of
it
had
never
failed
to
break
their
darkness
.
Last
*NL*
Christmas
Eve
and
all
Christmas
Day
Jurgis
had
toiled
on
the
killing
*NL*
beds
,
and
Ona
at
wrapping
hams
,
and
still
they
had
found
strength
*NL*
enough
to
take
the
children
for
a
walk
upon
the
avenue
,
to
see
the
store
*NL*
windows
all
decorated
with
Christmas
trees
and
ablaze
with
electric
*NL*
lights
.
In
one
window
there
would
be
live
geese
,
in
another
marvels
in
*NL*
sugar
--
pink
and
white
canes
big
enough
for
ogres
,
and
cakes
with
*NL*
cherubs
upon
them
;
in
a
third
there
would
be
rows
of
fat
yellow
turkeys
,
*NL*
decorated
with
rosettes
,
and
rabbits
and
squirrels
hanging
;
in
a
fourth
*NL*
would
be
a
fairyland
of
toys
--
lovely
dolls
with
pink
dresses
,
and
woolly
*NL*
sheep
and
drums
and
soldier
hats
.
Nor
did
they
have
to
go
without
their
*NL*
share
of
all
this
,
either
.
The
last
time
they
had
had
a
big
basket
with
*NL*
them
and
all
their
Christmas
marketing
to
do
--
a
roast
of
pork
and
a
*NL*
cabbage
and
some
rye
bread
,
and
a
pair
of
mittens
for
Ona
,
and
a
rubber
*NL*
doll
that
squeaked
,
and
a
little
green
cornucopia
full
of
candy
to
be
*NL*
hung
from
the
gas
jet
and
gazed
at
by
half
a
dozen
pairs
of
longing
*NL*
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
half
a
year
of
the
sausage
machines
and
the
fertilizer
mill
had
not
*NL*
been
able
to
kill
the
thought
of
Christmas
in
them
;
there
was
a
choking
*NL*
in
Jurgis
'
throat
as
he
recalled
that
the
very
night
Ona
had
not
come
*NL*
home
Teta
Elzbieta
had
taken
him
aside
and
shown
him
an
old
valentine
*NL*
that
she
had
picked
up
in
a
paper
store
for
three
cents
--
dingy
and
*NL*
shopworn
,
but
with
bright
colors
,
and
figures
of
angels
and
doves
.
*NL*
She
had
wiped
all
the
specks
off
this
,
and
was
going
to
set
it
on
the
*NL*
mantel
,
where
the
children
could
see
it
.
Great
sobs
shook
Jurgis
at
this
*NL*
memory
--
they
would
spend
their
Christmas
in
misery
and
despair
,
with
*NL*
him
in
prison
and
Ona
ill
and
their
home
in
desolation
.
Ah
,
it
was
too
*NL*
cruel
!
Why
at
least
had
they
not
left
him
alone
--
why
,
after
they
had
*NL*
shut
him
in
jail
,
must
they
be
ringing
Christmas
chimes
in
his
ears
!
*NL*
*NL*
But
no
,
their
bells
were
not
ringing
for
him
--
their
Christmas
was
not
*NL*
meant
for
him
,
they
were
simply
not
counting
him
at
all
.
He
was
of
no
*NL*
consequence
--
he
was
flung
aside
,
like
a
bit
of
trash
,
the
carcass
of
*NL*
some
animal
.
It
was
horrible
,
horrible
!
His
wife
might
be
dying
,
his
*NL*
baby
might
be
starving
,
his
whole
family
might
be
perishing
in
the
*NL*
cold
--
and
all
the
while
they
were
ringing
their
Christmas
chimes
!
And
*NL*
the
bitter
mockery
of
it
--
all
this
was
punishment
for
him
!
They
put
him
*NL*
in
a
place
where
the
snow
could
not
beat
in
,
where
the
cold
could
not
*NL*
eat
through
his
bones
;
they
brought
him
food
and
drink
--
why
,
in
the
name
*NL*
of
heaven
,
if
they
must
punish
him
,
did
they
not
put
his
family
in
jail
*NL*
and
leave
him
outside
--
why
could
they
find
no
better
way
to
punish
him
*NL*
than
to
leave
three
weak
women
and
six
helpless
children
to
starve
and
*NL*
freeze
?
That
was
their
law
,
that
was
their
justice
!
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
stood
upright
;
trembling
with
passion
,
his
hands
clenched
and
*NL*
his
arms
upraised
,
his
whole
soul
ablaze
with
hatred
and
defiance
.
Ten
*NL*
thousand
curses
upon
them
and
their
law
!
Their
justice
--
it
was
a
lie
,
it
*NL*
was
a
lie
,
a
hideous
,
brutal
lie
,
a
thing
too
black
and
hateful
for
any
*NL*
world
but
a
world
of
nightmares
.
It
was
a
sham
and
a
loathsome
mockery
.
*NL*
There
was
no
justice
,
there
was
no
right
,
anywhere
in
it
--
it
was
*NL*
only
force
,
it
was
tyranny
,
the
will
and
the
power
,
reckless
and
*NL*
unrestrained
!
They
had
ground
him
beneath
their
heel
,
they
had
devoured
*NL*
all
his
substance
;
they
had
murdered
his
old
father
,
they
had
broken
and
*NL*
wrecked
his
wife
,
they
had
crushed
and
cowed
his
whole
family
;
and
now
*NL*
they
were
through
with
him
,
they
had
no
further
use
for
him
--
and
because
*NL*
he
had
interfered
with
them
,
had
gotten
in
their
way
,
this
was
what
they
*NL*
had
done
to
him
!
They
had
put
him
behind
bars
,
as
if
he
had
been
a
*NL*
wild
beast
,
a
thing
without
sense
or
reason
,
without
rights
,
without
*NL*
affections
,
without
feelings
.
Nay
,
they
would
not
even
have
treated
a
*NL*
beast
as
they
had
treated
him
!
Would
any
man
in
his
senses
have
trapped
*NL*
a
wild
thing
in
its
lair
,
and
left
its
young
behind
to
die
?
*NL*
*NL*
These
midnight
hours
were
fateful
ones
to
Jurgis
;
in
them
was
the
*NL*
beginning
of
his
rebellion
,
of
his
outlawry
and
his
unbelief
.
He
had
no
*NL*
wit
to
trace
back
the
social
crime
to
its
far
sources
--
he
could
not
say
*NL*
that
it
was
the
thing
men
have
called
``
the
system
''
that
was
crushing
him
*NL*
to
the
earth
;
that
it
was
the
packers
,
his
masters
,
who
had
bought
up
*NL*
the
law
of
the
land
,
and
had
dealt
out
their
brutal
will
to
him
from
the
*NL*
seat
of
justice
.
He
only
knew
that
he
was
wronged
,
and
that
the
world
*NL*
had
wronged
him
;
that
the
law
,
that
society
,
with
all
its
powers
,
had
*NL*
declared
itself
his
foe
.
And
every
hour
his
soul
grew
blacker
,
every
*NL*
hour
he
dreamed
new
dreams
of
vengeance
,
of
defiance
,
of
raging
,
*NL*
frenzied
hate
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
vilest
deeds
,
like
poison
weeds
,
*NL*
Bloom
well
in
prison
air
;
*NL*
It
is
only
what
is
good
in
Man
*NL*
That
wastes
and
withers
there
;
*NL*
Pale
Anguish
keeps
the
heavy
gate
,
*NL*
And
the
Warder
is
Despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
wrote
a
poet
,
to
whom
the
world
had
dealt
its
justice
--
*NL*
*NL*
I
know
not
whether
Laws
be
right
,
*NL*
Or
whether
Laws
be
wrong
;
*NL*
All
that
we
know
who
lie
in
gaol
*NL*
Is
that
the
wall
is
strong
.
*NL*
And
they
do
well
to
hide
their
hell
,
*NL*
For
in
it
things
are
done
*NL*
That
Son
of
God
nor
son
of
Man
*NL*
Ever
should
look
upon
!

Chapter
17
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
At
seven
o'clock
the
next
morning
Jurgis
was
let
out
to
get
water
to
*NL*
wash
his
cell
--
a
duty
which
he
performed
faithfully
,
but
which
most
*NL*
of
the
prisoners
were
accustomed
to
shirk
,
until
their
cells
became
so
*NL*
filthy
that
the
guards
interposed
.
Then
he
had
more
``
duffers
and
*NL*
dope
,
''
and
afterward
was
allowed
three
hours
for
exercise
,
in
a
long
,
*NL*
cement-walked
court
roofed
with
glass
.
Here
were
all
the
inmates
of
*NL*
the
jail
crowded
together
.
At
one
side
of
the
court
was
a
place
for
*NL*
visitors
,
cut
off
by
two
heavy
wire
screens
,
a
foot
apart
,
so
that
*NL*
nothing
could
be
passed
in
to
the
prisoners
;
here
Jurgis
watched
*NL*
anxiously
,
but
there
came
no
one
to
see
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
after
he
went
back
to
his
cell
,
a
keeper
opened
the
door
to
let
*NL*
in
another
prisoner
.
He
was
a
dapper
young
fellow
,
with
a
light
brown
*NL*
mustache
and
blue
eyes
,
and
a
graceful
figure
.
He
nodded
to
Jurgis
,
and
*NL*
then
,
as
the
keeper
closed
the
door
upon
him
,
began
gazing
critically
*NL*
about
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
pal
,
''
he
said
,
as
his
glance
encountered
Jurgis
again
,
``
good
*NL*
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
morning
,
''
said
Jurgis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
rum
go
for
Christmas
,
eh
?
''
added
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
nodded
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
newcomer
went
to
the
bunks
and
inspected
the
blankets
;
he
lifted
*NL*
up
the
mattress
,
and
then
dropped
it
with
an
exclamation
.
``
My
God
!
''
he
*NL*
said
,
``
that
's
the
worst
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
glanced
at
Jurgis
again
.
``
Looks
as
if
it
had
n't
been
slept
in
last
*NL*
night
.
Could
n't
stand
it
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
want
to
sleep
last
night
,
''
said
Jurgis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
did
you
come
in
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yesterday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
had
another
look
around
,
and
then
wrinkled
up
his
nose
.
*NL*
``
There
's
the
devil
of
a
stink
in
here
,
''
he
said
,
suddenly
.
``
What
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
me
,
''
said
Jurgis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
n't
they
make
you
wash
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
this
do
n't
wash
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fertilizer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fertilizer
!
The
deuce
!
What
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
work
in
the
stockyards
--
at
least
I
did
until
the
other
day
.
It
's
in
*NL*
my
clothes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
new
one
on
me
,
''
said
the
newcomer
.
``
I
thought
I
'd
been
up
*NL*
against
'em
all
.
What
are
you
in
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hit
my
boss
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
that
's
it
.
What
did
he
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
--
he
treated
me
mean
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
.
You
're
what
's
called
an
honest
workingman
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
?
''
Jurgis
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
?
''
The
other
laughed
.
``
They
say
I
'm
a
cracksman
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
that
?
''
asked
Jurgis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Safes
,
and
such
things
,
''
answered
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
said
Jurgis
,
wonderingly
,
and
stared
at
the
speaker
in
awe
.
``
You
*NL*
mean
you
break
into
them
--
you
--
you
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
laughed
the
other
,
``
that
's
what
they
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
look
to
be
over
twenty-two
or
three
,
though
,
as
Jurgis
found
*NL*
afterward
,
he
was
thirty
.
He
spoke
like
a
man
of
education
,
like
what
*NL*
the
world
calls
a
``
gentleman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
what
you
're
here
for
?
''
Jurgis
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
was
the
answer
.
``
I
'm
here
for
disorderly
conduct
.
They
were
mad
*NL*
because
they
could
n't
get
any
evidence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
your
name
?
''
the
young
fellow
continued
after
a
pause
.
``
My
name
's
*NL*
Duane
--
Jack
Duane
.
I
've
more
than
a
dozen
,
but
that
's
my
company
one
.
''
*NL*
He
seated
himself
on
the
floor
with
his
back
to
the
wall
and
his
legs
*NL*
crossed
,
and
went
on
talking
easily
;
he
soon
put
Jurgis
on
a
friendly
*NL*
footing
--
he
was
evidently
a
man
of
the
world
,
used
to
getting
on
,
and
*NL*
not
too
proud
to
hold
conversation
with
a
mere
laboring
man
.
He
drew
*NL*
Jurgis
out
,
and
heard
all
about
his
life
all
but
the
one
unmentionable
*NL*
thing
;
and
then
he
told
stories
about
his
own
life
.
He
was
a
great
*NL*
one
for
stories
,
not
always
of
the
choicest
.
Being
sent
to
jail
had
*NL*
apparently
not
disturbed
his
cheerfulness
;
he
had
``
done
time
''
twice
*NL*
before
,
it
seemed
,
and
he
took
it
all
with
a
frolic
welcome
.
What
with
*NL*
women
and
wine
and
the
excitement
of
his
vocation
,
a
man
could
afford
to
*NL*
rest
now
and
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
Naturally
,
the
aspect
of
prison
life
was
changed
for
Jurgis
by
the
*NL*
arrival
of
a
cell
mate
.
He
could
not
turn
his
face
to
the
wall
and
*NL*
sulk
,
he
had
to
speak
when
he
was
spoken
to
;
nor
could
he
help
being
*NL*
interested
in
the
conversation
of
Duane
--
the
first
educated
man
with
*NL*
whom
he
had
ever
talked
.
How
could
he
help
listening
with
wonder
while
*NL*
the
other
told
of
midnight
ventures
and
perilous
escapes
,
of
feastings
*NL*
and
orgies
,
of
fortunes
squandered
in
a
night
?
The
young
fellow
had
an
*NL*
amused
contempt
for
Jurgis
,
as
a
sort
of
working
mule
;
he
,
too
,
had
*NL*
felt
the
world
's
injustice
,
but
instead
of
bearing
it
patiently
,
he
had
*NL*
struck
back
,
and
struck
hard
.
He
was
striking
all
the
time
--
there
was
*NL*
war
between
him
and
society
.
He
was
a
genial
freebooter
,
living
off
the
*NL*
enemy
,
without
fear
or
shame
.
He
was
not
always
victorious
,
but
then
*NL*
defeat
did
not
mean
annihilation
,
and
need
not
break
his
spirit
.
*NL*
*NL*
Withal
he
was
a
goodhearted
fellow
--
too
much
so
,
it
appeared
.
His
story
*NL*
came
out
,
not
in
the
first
day
,
nor
the
second
,
but
in
the
long
hours
*NL*
that
dragged
by
,
in
which
they
had
nothing
to
do
but
talk
and
nothing
*NL*
to
talk
of
but
themselves
.
Jack
Duane
was
from
the
East
;
he
was
a
*NL*
college-bred
man
--
had
been
studying
electrical
engineering
.
Then
his
*NL*
father
had
met
with
misfortune
in
business
and
killed
himself
;
and
there
*NL*
had
been
his
mother
and
a
younger
brother
and
sister
.
Also
,
there
was
an
*NL*
invention
of
Duane
's
;
Jurgis
could
not
understand
it
clearly
,
but
it
had
*NL*
to
do
with
telegraphing
,
and
it
was
a
very
important
thing
--
there
were
*NL*
fortunes
in
it
,
millions
upon
millions
of
dollars
.
And
Duane
had
been
*NL*
robbed
of
it
by
a
great
company
,
and
got
tangled
up
in
lawsuits
and
lost
*NL*
all
his
money
.
Then
somebody
had
given
him
a
tip
on
a
horse
race
,
and
he
*NL*
had
tried
to
retrieve
his
fortune
with
another
person
's
money
,
and
had
*NL*
to
run
away
,
and
all
the
rest
had
come
from
that
.
The
other
asked
*NL*
him
what
had
led
him
to
safe-breaking
--
to
Jurgis
a
wild
and
appalling
*NL*
occupation
to
think
about
.
A
man
he
had
met
,
his
cell
mate
had
*NL*
replied
--
one
thing
leads
to
another
.
Did
n't
he
ever
wonder
about
his
*NL*
family
,
Jurgis
asked
.
Sometimes
,
the
other
answered
,
but
not
often
--
he
*NL*
did
n't
allow
it
.
Thinking
about
it
would
make
it
no
better
.
This
was
n't
*NL*
a
world
in
which
a
man
had
any
business
with
a
family
;
sooner
or
later
*NL*
Jurgis
would
find
that
out
also
,
and
give
up
the
fight
and
shift
for
*NL*
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
was
so
transparently
what
he
pretended
to
be
that
his
cell
mate
*NL*
was
as
open
with
him
as
a
child
;
it
was
pleasant
to
tell
him
adventures
,
*NL*
he
was
so
full
of
wonder
and
admiration
,
he
was
so
new
to
the
ways
of
*NL*
the
country
.
Duane
did
not
even
bother
to
keep
back
names
and
places
--
he
*NL*
told
all
his
triumphs
and
his
failures
,
his
loves
and
his
griefs
.
Also
*NL*
he
introduced
Jurgis
to
many
of
the
other
prisoners
,
nearly
half
of
whom
*NL*
he
knew
by
name
.
The
crowd
had
already
given
Jurgis
a
name
--
they
called
*NL*
him
``
the
stinker
.
''
This
was
cruel
,
but
they
meant
no
harm
by
it
,
and
he
*NL*
took
it
with
a
good-natured
grin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
friend
had
caught
now
and
then
a
whiff
from
the
sewers
over
which
*NL*
he
lived
,
but
this
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
ever
been
splashed
by
*NL*
their
filth
.
This
jail
was
a
Noah
's
ark
of
the
city
's
crime
--
there
were
*NL*
murderers
,
``
hold-up
men
''
and
burglars
,
embezzlers
,
counterfeiters
and
*NL*
forgers
,
bigamists
,
``
shoplifters
,
''
``
confidence
men
,
''
petty
thieves
*NL*
and
pickpockets
,
gamblers
and
procurers
,
brawlers
,
beggars
,
tramps
*NL*
and
drunkards
;
they
were
black
and
white
,
old
and
young
,
Americans
and
*NL*
natives
of
every
nation
under
the
sun
.
There
were
hardened
criminals
and
*NL*
innocent
men
too
poor
to
give
bail
;
old
men
,
and
boys
literally
not
yet
*NL*
in
their
teens
.
They
were
the
drainage
of
the
great
festering
ulcer
of
*NL*
society
;
they
were
hideous
to
look
upon
,
sickening
to
talk
to
.
All
life
*NL*
had
turned
to
rottenness
and
stench
in
them
--
love
was
a
beastliness
,
joy
*NL*
was
a
snare
,
and
God
was
an
imprecation
.
They
strolled
here
and
there
*NL*
about
the
courtyard
,
and
Jurgis
listened
to
them
.
He
was
ignorant
and
*NL*
they
were
wise
;
they
had
been
everywhere
and
tried
everything
.
They
*NL*
could
tell
the
whole
hateful
story
of
it
,
set
forth
the
inner
soul
of
*NL*
a
city
in
which
justice
and
honor
,
women
's
bodies
and
men
's
souls
,
were
*NL*
for
sale
in
the
marketplace
,
and
human
beings
writhed
and
fought
and
*NL*
fell
upon
each
other
like
wolves
in
a
pit
;
in
which
lusts
were
raging
*NL*
fires
,
and
men
were
fuel
,
and
humanity
was
festering
and
stewing
and
*NL*
wallowing
in
its
own
corruption
.
Into
this
wild-beast
tangle
these
men
*NL*
had
been
born
without
their
consent
,
they
had
taken
part
in
it
because
*NL*
they
could
not
help
it
;
that
they
were
in
jail
was
no
disgrace
to
*NL*
them
,
for
the
game
had
never
been
fair
,
the
dice
were
loaded
.
They
were
*NL*
swindlers
and
thieves
of
pennies
and
dimes
,
and
they
had
been
trapped
*NL*
and
put
out
of
the
way
by
the
swindlers
and
thieves
of
millions
of
*NL*
dollars
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
To
most
of
this
Jurgis
tried
not
to
listen
.
They
frightened
him
with
*NL*
their
savage
mockery
;
and
all
the
while
his
heart
was
far
away
,
where
*NL*
his
loved
ones
were
calling
.
Now
and
then
in
the
midst
of
it
his
*NL*
thoughts
would
take
flight
;
and
then
the
tears
would
come
into
his
*NL*
eyes
--
and
he
would
be
called
back
by
the
jeering
laughter
of
his
*NL*
companions
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
spent
a
week
in
this
company
,
and
during
all
that
time
he
had
no
word
*NL*
from
his
home
.
He
paid
one
of
his
fifteen
cents
for
a
postal
card
,
and
*NL*
his
companion
wrote
a
note
to
the
family
,
telling
them
where
he
was
*NL*
and
when
he
would
be
tried
.
There
came
no
answer
to
it
,
however
,
and
at
*NL*
last
,
the
day
before
New
Year
's
,
Jurgis
bade
good-by
to
Jack
Duane
.
The
*NL*
latter
gave
him
his
address
,
or
rather
the
address
of
his
mistress
,
and
*NL*
made
Jurgis
promise
to
look
him
up
.
``
Maybe
I
could
help
you
out
of
a
*NL*
hole
some
day
,
''
he
said
,
and
added
that
he
was
sorry
to
have
him
go
.
*NL*
Jurgis
rode
in
the
patrol
wagon
back
to
Justice
Callahan
's
court
for
*NL*
trial
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
first
things
he
made
out
as
he
entered
the
room
was
Teta
*NL*
Elzbieta
and
little
Kotrina
,
looking
pale
and
frightened
,
seated
far
in
*NL*
the
rear
.
His
heart
began
to
pound
,
but
he
did
not
dare
to
try
to
signal
*NL*
to
them
,
and
neither
did
Elzbieta
.
He
took
his
seat
in
the
prisoners
'
*NL*
pen
and
sat
gazing
at
them
in
helpless
agony
.
He
saw
that
Ona
was
not
*NL*
with
them
,
and
was
full
of
foreboding
as
to
what
that
might
mean
.
He
*NL*
spent
half
an
hour
brooding
over
this
--
and
then
suddenly
he
straightened
*NL*
up
and
the
blood
rushed
into
his
face
.
A
man
had
come
in
--
Jurgis
could
*NL*
not
see
his
features
for
the
bandages
that
swathed
him
,
but
he
knew
the
*NL*
burly
figure
.
It
was
Connor
!
A
trembling
seized
him
,
and
his
limbs
bent
*NL*
as
if
for
a
spring
.
Then
suddenly
he
felt
a
hand
on
his
collar
,
and
*NL*
heard
a
voice
behind
him
:
``
Sit
down
,
you
son
of
a
--
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
subsided
,
but
he
never
took
his
eyes
off
his
enemy
.
The
fellow
was
*NL*
still
alive
,
which
was
a
disappointment
,
in
one
way
;
and
yet
it
was
*NL*
pleasant
to
see
him
,
all
in
penitential
plasters
.
He
and
the
company
*NL*
lawyer
,
who
was
with
him
,
came
and
took
seats
within
the
judge
's
*NL*
railing
;
and
a
minute
later
the
clerk
called
Jurgis
'
name
,
and
the
*NL*
policeman
jerked
him
to
his
feet
and
led
him
before
the
bar
,
gripping
*NL*
him
tightly
by
the
arm
,
lest
he
should
spring
upon
the
boss
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
listened
while
the
man
entered
the
witness
chair
,
took
the
oath
,
*NL*
and
told
his
story
.
The
wife
of
the
prisoner
had
been
employed
in
a
*NL*
department
near
him
,
and
had
been
discharged
for
impudence
to
him
.
Half
*NL*
an
hour
later
he
had
been
violently
attacked
,
knocked
down
,
and
almost
*NL*
choked
to
death
.
He
had
brought
witnesses
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
will
probably
not
be
necessary
,
''
observed
the
judge
and
he
turned
*NL*
to
Jurgis
.
``
You
admit
attacking
the
plaintiff
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Him
?
''
inquired
Jurgis
,
pointing
at
the
boss
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
the
judge
.
``
I
hit
him
,
sir
,
''
said
Jurgis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
`
your
Honor
,
'
''
said
the
officer
,
pinching
his
arm
hard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
Honor
,
''
said
Jurgis
,
obediently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
tried
to
choke
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
your
Honor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ever
been
arrested
before
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
your
Honor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
you
to
say
for
yourself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
hesitated
.
What
had
he
to
say
?
In
two
years
and
a
half
he
had
*NL*
learned
to
speak
English
for
practical
purposes
,
but
these
had
never
*NL*
included
the
statement
that
some
one
had
intimidated
and
seduced
his
*NL*
wife
.
He
tried
once
or
twice
,
stammering
and
balking
,
to
the
annoyance
*NL*
of
the
judge
,
who
was
gasping
from
the
odor
of
fertilizer
.
Finally
,
*NL*
the
prisoner
made
it
understood
that
his
vocabulary
was
inadequate
,
and
*NL*
there
stepped
up
a
dapper
young
man
with
waxed
mustaches
,
bidding
him
*NL*
speak
in
any
language
he
knew
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
began
;
supposing
that
he
would
be
given
time
,
he
explained
how
*NL*
the
boss
had
taken
advantage
of
his
wife
's
position
to
make
advances
*NL*
to
her
and
had
threatened
her
with
the
loss
of
her
place
.
When
the
*NL*
interpreter
had
translated
this
,
the
judge
,
whose
calendar
was
crowded
,
*NL*
and
whose
automobile
was
ordered
for
a
certain
hour
,
interrupted
with
*NL*
the
remark
:
``
Oh
,
I
see
.
Well
,
if
he
made
love
to
your
wife
,
why
did
n't
*NL*
she
complain
to
the
superintendent
or
leave
the
place
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
hesitated
,
somewhat
taken
aback
;
he
began
to
explain
that
they
*NL*
were
very
poor
--
that
work
was
hard
to
get
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
,
''
said
Justice
Callahan
;
``
so
instead
you
thought
you
would
knock
*NL*
him
down
.
''
He
turned
to
the
plaintiff
,
inquiring
,
``
Is
there
any
truth
in
*NL*
this
story
,
Mr.
Connor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
particle
,
your
Honor
,
''
said
the
boss
.
``
It
is
very
*NL*
unpleasant
--
they
tell
some
such
tale
every
time
you
have
to
discharge
a
*NL*
woman
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
know
,
''
said
the
judge
.
``
I
hear
it
often
enough
.
The
fellow
seems
*NL*
to
have
handled
you
pretty
roughly
.
Thirty
days
and
costs
.
Next
case
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
had
been
listening
in
perplexity
.
It
was
only
when
the
policeman
*NL*
who
had
him
by
the
arm
turned
and
started
to
lead
him
away
that
he
*NL*
realized
that
sentence
had
been
passed
.
He
gazed
round
him
wildly
.
*NL*
``
Thirty
days
!
''
he
panted
and
then
he
whirled
upon
the
judge
.
``
What
will
*NL*
my
family
do
?
''
he
cried
frantically
.
``
I
have
a
wife
and
baby
,
sir
,
and
*NL*
they
have
no
money
--
my
God
,
they
will
starve
to
death
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
have
done
well
to
think
about
them
before
you
committed
*NL*
the
assault
,
''
said
the
judge
dryly
,
as
he
turned
to
look
at
the
next
*NL*
prisoner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
would
have
spoken
again
,
but
the
policeman
had
seized
him
by
the
*NL*
collar
and
was
twisting
it
,
and
a
second
policeman
was
making
for
him
*NL*
with
evidently
hostile
intentions
.
So
he
let
them
lead
him
away
.
Far
*NL*
down
the
room
he
saw
Elzbieta
and
Kotrina
,
risen
from
their
seats
,
*NL*
staring
in
fright
;
he
made
one
effort
to
go
to
them
,
and
then
,
brought
*NL*
back
by
another
twist
at
his
throat
,
he
bowed
his
head
and
gave
up
the
*NL*
struggle
.
They
thrust
him
into
a
cell
room
,
where
other
prisoners
were
*NL*
waiting
;
and
as
soon
as
court
had
adjourned
they
led
him
down
with
them
*NL*
into
the
``
Black
Maria
,
''
and
drove
him
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
time
Jurgis
was
bound
for
the
``
Bridewell
,
''
a
petty
jail
where
Cook
*NL*
County
prisoners
serve
their
time
.
It
was
even
filthier
and
more
crowded
*NL*
than
the
county
jail
;
all
the
smaller
fry
out
of
the
latter
had
been
*NL*
sifted
into
it
--
the
petty
thieves
and
swindlers
,
the
brawlers
and
*NL*
vagrants
.
For
his
cell
mate
Jurgis
had
an
Italian
fruit
seller
who
*NL*
had
refused
to
pay
his
graft
to
the
policeman
,
and
been
arrested
for
*NL*
carrying
a
large
pocketknife
;
as
he
did
not
understand
a
word
of
English
*NL*
our
friend
was
glad
when
he
left
.
He
gave
place
to
a
Norwegian
sailor
,
*NL*
who
had
lost
half
an
ear
in
a
drunken
brawl
,
and
who
proved
to
be
*NL*
quarrelsome
,
cursing
Jurgis
because
he
moved
in
his
bunk
and
caused
*NL*
the
roaches
to
drop
upon
the
lower
one
.
It
would
have
been
quite
*NL*
intolerable
,
staying
in
a
cell
with
this
wild
beast
,
but
for
the
fact
*NL*
that
all
day
long
the
prisoners
were
put
at
work
breaking
stone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ten
days
of
his
thirty
Jurgis
spent
thus
,
without
hearing
a
word
from
*NL*
his
family
;
then
one
day
a
keeper
came
and
informed
him
that
there
was
*NL*
a
visitor
to
see
him
.
Jurgis
turned
white
,
and
so
weak
at
the
knees
that
*NL*
he
could
hardly
leave
his
cell
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
led
him
down
the
corridor
and
a
flight
of
steps
to
the
visitors
'
*NL*
room
,
which
was
barred
like
a
cell
.
Through
the
grating
Jurgis
could
*NL*
see
some
one
sitting
in
a
chair
;
and
as
he
came
into
the
room
the
person
*NL*
started
up
,
and
he
saw
that
it
was
little
Stanislovas
.
At
the
sight
*NL*
of
some
one
from
home
the
big
fellow
nearly
went
to
pieces
--
he
had
to
*NL*
steady
himself
by
a
chair
,
and
he
put
his
other
hand
to
his
forehead
,
as
*NL*
if
to
clear
away
a
mist
.
``
Well
?
''
he
said
,
weakly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Stanislovas
was
also
trembling
,
and
all
but
too
frightened
to
*NL*
speak
.
``
They
--
they
sent
me
to
tell
you
--
''
he
said
,
with
a
gulp
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
Jurgis
repeated
.
He
followed
the
boy
's
glance
to
where
the
*NL*
keeper
was
standing
watching
them
.
``
Never
mind
that
,
''
Jurgis
cried
,
*NL*
wildly
.
``
How
are
they
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ona
is
very
sick
,
''
Stanislovas
said
;
``
and
we
are
almost
starving
.
We
*NL*
ca
n't
get
along
;
we
thought
you
might
be
able
to
help
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
gripped
the
chair
tighter
;
there
were
beads
of
perspiration
on
*NL*
his
forehead
,
and
his
hand
shook
.
``
I
--
ca
n't
help
you
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ona
lies
in
her
room
all
day
,
''
the
boy
went
on
,
breathlessly
.
``
She
*NL*
wo
n't
eat
anything
,
and
she
cries
all
the
time
.
She
wo
n't
tell
what
is
*NL*
the
matter
and
she
wo
n't
go
to
work
at
all
.
Then
a
long
time
ago
the
man
*NL*
came
for
the
rent
.
He
was
very
cross
.
He
came
again
last
week
.
He
said
*NL*
he
would
turn
us
out
of
the
house
.
And
then
Marija
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
sob
choked
Stanislovas
,
and
he
stopped
.
``
What
's
the
matter
with
*NL*
Marija
?
''
cried
Jurgis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
cut
her
hand
!
''
said
the
boy
.
``
She
's
cut
it
bad
,
this
time
,
worse
*NL*
than
before
.
She
ca
n't
work
and
it
's
all
turning
green
,
and
the
company
*NL*
doctor
says
she
may
--
she
may
have
to
have
it
cut
off
.
And
Marija
cries
*NL*
all
the
time
--
her
money
is
nearly
all
gone
,
too
,
and
we
ca
n't
pay
the
*NL*
rent
and
the
interest
on
the
house
;
and
we
have
no
coal
and
nothing
more
*NL*
to
eat
,
and
the
man
at
the
store
,
he
says
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
fellow
stopped
again
,
beginning
to
whimper
.
``
Go
on
!
''
the
*NL*
other
panted
in
frenzy
--
``
Go
on
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
--
I
will
,
''
sobbed
Stanislovas
.
``
It
's
so
--
so
cold
all
the
time
.
And
*NL*
last
Sunday
it
snowed
again
--
a
deep
,
deep
snow
--
and
I
could
n't
--
could
n't
*NL*
get
to
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
!
''
Jurgis
half
shouted
,
and
he
took
a
step
toward
the
child
.
There
*NL*
was
an
old
hatred
between
them
because
of
the
snow
--
ever
since
that
*NL*
dreadful
morning
when
the
boy
had
had
his
fingers
frozen
and
Jurgis
had
*NL*
had
to
beat
him
to
send
him
to
work
.
Now
he
clenched
his
hands
,
looking
*NL*
as
if
he
would
try
to
break
through
the
grating
.
``
You
little
villain
,
''
*NL*
he
cried
,
``
you
did
n't
try
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
--
I
did
!
''
wailed
Stanislovas
,
shrinking
from
him
in
terror
.
``
I
*NL*
tried
all
day
--
two
days
.
Elzbieta
was
with
me
,
and
she
could
n't
either
.
*NL*
We
could
n't
walk
at
all
,
it
was
so
deep
.
And
we
had
nothing
to
eat
,
and
*NL*
oh
,
it
was
so
cold
!
I
tried
,
and
then
the
third
day
Ona
went
with
me
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ona
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
She
tried
to
get
to
work
,
too
.
She
had
to
.
We
were
all
starving
.
*NL*
But
she
had
lost
her
place
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
reeled
,
and
gave
a
gasp
.
``
She
went
back
to
that
place
?
''
he
*NL*
screamed
.
``
She
tried
to
,
''
said
Stanislovas
,
gazing
at
him
in
perplexity
.
*NL*
``
Why
not
,
Jurgis
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
breathed
hard
,
three
or
four
times
.
``
Go
--
on
,
''
he
panted
,
*NL*
finally
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
went
with
her
,
''
said
Stanislovas
,
``
but
Miss
Henderson
would
n't
take
*NL*
her
back
.
And
Connor
saw
her
and
cursed
her
.
He
was
still
bandaged
*NL*
up
--
why
did
you
hit
him
,
Jurgis
?
''
-LRB-
There
was
some
fascinating
mystery
*NL*
about
this
,
the
little
fellow
knew
;
but
he
could
get
no
satisfaction
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
could
not
speak
;
he
could
only
stare
,
his
eyes
starting
out
.
``
She
*NL*
has
been
trying
to
get
other
work
,
''
the
boy
went
on
;
``
but
she
's
so
weak
*NL*
she
ca
n't
keep
up
.
And
my
boss
would
not
take
me
back
,
either
--
Ona
says
*NL*
he
knows
Connor
,
and
that
's
the
reason
;
they
've
all
got
a
grudge
against
*NL*
us
now
.
So
I
've
got
to
go
downtown
and
sell
papers
with
the
rest
of
the
*NL*
boys
and
Kotrina
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kotrina
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
she
's
been
selling
papers
,
too
.
She
does
best
,
because
she
's
*NL*
a
girl
.
Only
the
cold
is
so
bad
--
it
's
terrible
coming
home
at
night
,
*NL*
Jurgis
.
Sometimes
they
ca
n't
come
home
at
all
--
I
'm
going
to
try
to
find
*NL*
them
tonight
and
sleep
where
they
do
,
it
's
so
late
and
it
's
such
a
long
*NL*
ways
home
.
I
've
had
to
walk
,
and
I
did
n't
know
where
it
was
--
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
how
to
get
back
,
either
.
Only
mother
said
I
must
come
,
because
you
*NL*
would
want
to
know
,
and
maybe
somebody
would
help
your
family
when
they
*NL*
had
put
you
in
jail
so
you
could
n't
work
.
And
I
walked
all
day
to
get
*NL*
here
--
and
I
only
had
a
piece
of
bread
for
breakfast
,
Jurgis
.
Mother
*NL*
has
n't
any
work
either
,
because
the
sausage
department
is
shut
down
;
*NL*
and
she
goes
and
begs
at
houses
with
a
basket
,
and
people
give
her
food
.
*NL*
Only
she
did
n't
get
much
yesterday
;
it
was
too
cold
for
her
fingers
,
and
*NL*
today
she
was
crying
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
little
Stanislovas
went
on
,
sobbing
as
he
talked
;
and
Jurgis
stood
,
*NL*
gripping
the
table
tightly
,
saying
not
a
word
,
but
feeling
that
his
*NL*
head
would
burst
;
it
was
like
having
weights
piled
upon
him
,
one
after
*NL*
another
,
crushing
the
life
out
of
him
.
He
struggled
and
fought
within
*NL*
himself
--
as
if
in
some
terrible
nightmare
,
in
which
a
man
suffers
an
*NL*
agony
,
and
can
not
lift
his
hand
,
nor
cry
out
,
but
feels
that
he
is
going
*NL*
mad
,
that
his
brain
is
on
fire
--
*NL*
*NL*
Just
when
it
seemed
to
him
that
another
turn
of
the
screw
would
kill
*NL*
him
,
little
Stanislovas
stopped
.
``
You
can
not
help
us
?
''
he
said
weakly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
shook
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
wo
n't
give
you
anything
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
shook
it
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
are
you
coming
out
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Three
weeks
yet
,
''
Jurgis
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
boy
gazed
around
him
uncertainly
.
``
Then
I
might
as
well
go
,
''
he
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
nodded
.
Then
,
suddenly
recollecting
,
he
put
his
hand
into
his
*NL*
pocket
and
drew
it
out
,
shaking
.
``
Here
,
''
he
said
,
holding
out
the
*NL*
fourteen
cents
.
``
Take
this
to
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Stanislovas
took
it
,
and
after
a
little
more
hesitation
,
started
*NL*
for
the
door
.
``
Good-by
,
Jurgis
,
''
he
said
,
and
the
other
noticed
that
he
*NL*
walked
unsteadily
as
he
passed
out
of
sight
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
minute
or
so
Jurgis
stood
clinging
to
his
chair
,
reeling
and
*NL*
swaying
;
then
the
keeper
touched
him
on
the
arm
,
and
he
turned
and
went
*NL*
back
to
breaking
stone
.

Chapter
18
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
did
not
get
out
of
the
Bridewell
quite
as
soon
as
he
had
*NL*
expected
.
To
his
sentence
there
were
added
``
court
costs
''
of
a
dollar
and
*NL*
a
half
--
he
was
supposed
to
pay
for
the
trouble
of
putting
him
in
jail
,
*NL*
and
not
having
the
money
,
was
obliged
to
work
it
off
by
three
days
*NL*
more
of
toil
.
Nobody
had
taken
the
trouble
to
tell
him
this
--
only
*NL*
after
counting
the
days
and
looking
forward
to
the
end
in
an
agony
of
*NL*
impatience
,
when
the
hour
came
that
he
expected
to
be
free
he
found
*NL*
himself
still
set
at
the
stone
heap
,
and
laughed
at
when
he
ventured
to
*NL*
protest
.
Then
he
concluded
he
must
have
counted
wrong
;
but
as
another
*NL*
day
passed
,
he
gave
up
all
hope
--
and
was
sunk
in
the
depths
of
despair
,
*NL*
when
one
morning
after
breakfast
a
keeper
came
to
him
with
the
word
that
*NL*
his
time
was
up
at
last
.
So
he
doffed
his
prison
garb
,
and
put
on
his
*NL*
old
fertilizer
clothing
,
and
heard
the
door
of
the
prison
clang
behind
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
upon
the
steps
,
bewildered
;
he
could
hardly
believe
that
it
was
*NL*
true
,
--
that
the
sky
was
above
him
again
and
the
open
street
before
him
;
*NL*
that
he
was
a
free
man
.
But
then
the
cold
began
to
strike
through
his
*NL*
clothes
,
and
he
started
quickly
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
had
been
a
heavy
snow
,
and
now
a
thaw
had
set
in
;
fine
sleety
rain
*NL*
was
falling
,
driven
by
a
wind
that
pierced
Jurgis
to
the
bone
.
He
had
*NL*
not
stopped
for
his-overcoat
when
he
set
out
to
``
do
up
''
Connor
,
and
so
*NL*
his
rides
in
the
patrol
wagons
had
been
cruel
experiences
;
his
clothing
*NL*
was
old
and
worn
thin
,
and
it
never
had
been
very
warm
.
Now
as
he
*NL*
trudged
on
the
rain
soon
wet
it
through
;
there
were
six
inches
of
watery
*NL*
slush
on
the
sidewalks
,
so
that
his
feet
would
soon
have
been
soaked
,
*NL*
even
had
there
been
no
holes
in
his
shoes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
had
had
enough
to
eat
in
the
jail
,
and
the
work
had
been
the
*NL*
least
trying
of
any
that
he
had
done
since
he
came
to
Chicago
;
but
even
*NL*
so
,
he
had
not
grown
strong
--
the
fear
and
grief
that
had
preyed
upon
his
*NL*
mind
had
worn
him
thin
.
Now
he
shivered
and
shrunk
from
the
rain
,
*NL*
hiding
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
hunching
his
shoulders
together
.
*NL*
The
Bridewell
grounds
were
on
the
outskirts
of
the
city
and
the
country
*NL*
around
them
was
unsettled
and
wild
--
on
one
side
was
the
big
drainage
*NL*
canal
,
and
on
the
other
a
maze
of
railroad
tracks
,
and
so
the
wind
had
*NL*
full
sweep
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
walking
a
ways
,
Jurgis
met
a
little
ragamuffin
whom
he
hailed
:
*NL*
``
Hey
,
sonny
!
''
The
boy
cocked
one
eye
at
him
--
he
knew
that
Jurgis
was
a
*NL*
``
jailbird
''
by
his
shaven
head
.
``
Wot
yer
want
?
''
he
queried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
go
to
the
stockyards
?
''
Jurgis
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
go
,
''
replied
the
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
hesitated
a
moment
,
nonplussed
.
Then
he
said
,
``
I
mean
which
is
*NL*
the
way
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
yer
say
so
then
?
''
was
the
response
,
and
the
boy
pointed
to
*NL*
the
northwest
,
across
the
tracks
.
``
That
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
far
is
it
?
''
Jurgis
asked
.
``
I
dunno
,
''
said
the
other
.
``
Mebbe
twenty
*NL*
miles
or
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Twenty
miles
!
''
Jurgis
echoed
,
and
his
face
fell
.
He
had
to
walk
every
*NL*
foot
of
it
,
for
they
had
turned
him
out
of
jail
without
a
penny
in
his
*NL*
pockets
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
,
when
he
once
got
started
,
and
his
blood
had
warmed
with
walking
,
*NL*
he
forgot
everything
in
the
fever
of
his
thoughts
.
All
the
dreadful
*NL*
imaginations
that
had
haunted
him
in
his
cell
now
rushed
into
his
mind
*NL*
at
once
.
The
agony
was
almost
over
--
he
was
going
to
find
out
;
and
he
*NL*
clenched
his
hands
in
his
pockets
as
he
strode
,
following
his
flying
*NL*
desire
,
almost
at
a
run
.
Ona
--
the
baby
--
the
family
--
the
house
--
he
would
*NL*
know
the
truth
about
them
all
!
And
he
was
coming
to
the
rescue
--
he
was
*NL*
free
again
!
His
hands
were
his
own
,
and
he
could
help
them
,
he
could
do
*NL*
battle
for
them
against
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
an
hour
or
so
he
walked
thus
,
and
then
he
began
to
look
about
him
.
*NL*
He
seemed
to
be
leaving
the
city
altogether
.
The
street
was
turning
into
*NL*
a
country
road
,
leading
out
to
the
westward
;
there
were
snow-covered
*NL*
fields
on
either
side
of
him
.
Soon
he
met
a
farmer
driving
a
two-horse
*NL*
wagon
loaded
with
straw
,
and
he
stopped
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
this
the
way
to
the
stockyards
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
farmer
scratched
his
head
.
``
I
dunno
jest
where
they
be
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
``
But
they
're
in
the
city
somewhere
,
and
you
're
going
dead
away
from
it
*NL*
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
looked
dazed
.
``
I
was
told
this
was
the
way
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
told
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
boy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
mebbe
he
was
playing
a
joke
on
ye
.
The
best
thing
ye
kin
do
is
to
*NL*
go
back
,
and
when
ye
git
into
town
ask
a
policeman
.
I
'd
take
ye
in
,
only
*NL*
I
've
come
a
long
ways
an
'
I
'm
loaded
heavy
.
Git
up
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
Jurgis
turned
and
followed
,
and
toward
the
end
of
the
morning
he
*NL*
began
to
see
Chicago
again
.
Past
endless
blocks
of
two-story
shanties
*NL*
he
walked
,
along
wooden
sidewalks
and
unpaved
pathways
treacherous
with
*NL*
deep
slush
holes
.
Every
few
blocks
there
would
be
a
railroad
crossing
*NL*
on
the
level
with
the
sidewalk
,
a
deathtrap
for
the
unwary
;
long
freight
*NL*
trains
would
be
passing
,
the
cars
clanking
and
crashing
together
,
and
*NL*
Jurgis
would
pace
about
waiting
,
burning
up
with
a
fever
of
impatience
.
*NL*
Occasionally
the
cars
would
stop
for
some
minutes
,
and
wagons
and
*NL*
streetcars
would
crowd
together
waiting
,
the
drivers
swearing
at
each
*NL*
other
,
or
hiding
beneath
umbrellas
out
of
the
rain
;
at
such
times
Jurgis
*NL*
would
dodge
under
the
gates
and
run
across
the
tracks
and
between
the
*NL*
cars
,
taking
his
life
into
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
crossed
a
long
bridge
over
a
river
frozen
solid
and
covered
with
*NL*
slush
.
Not
even
on
the
river
bank
was
the
snow
white
--
the
rain
which
*NL*
fell
was
a
diluted
solution
of
smoke
,
and
Jurgis
'
hands
and
face
were
*NL*
streaked
with
black
.
Then
he
came
into
the
business
part
of
the
city
,
*NL*
where
the
streets
were
sewers
of
inky
blackness
,
with
horses
sleeping
*NL*
and
plunging
,
and
women
and
children
flying
across
in
panic-stricken
*NL*
droves
.
These
streets
were
huge
canyons
formed
by
towering
black
*NL*
buildings
,
echoing
with
the
clang
of
car
gongs
and
the
shouts
of
*NL*
drivers
;
the
people
who
swarmed
in
them
were
as
busy
as
ants
--
all
*NL*
hurrying
breathlessly
,
never
stopping
to
look
at
anything
nor
at
each
*NL*
other
.
The
solitary
trampish-looking
foreigner
,
with
water-soaked
*NL*
clothing
and
haggard
face
and
anxious
eyes
,
was
as
much
alone
as
he
*NL*
hurried
past
them
,
as
much
unheeded
and
as
lost
,
as
if
he
had
been
a
*NL*
thousand
miles
deep
in
a
wilderness
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
policeman
gave
him
his
direction
and
told
him
that
he
had
five
miles
*NL*
to
go
.
He
came
again
to
the
slum
districts
,
to
avenues
of
saloons
and
*NL*
cheap
stores
,
with
long
dingy
red
factory
buildings
,
and
coal-yards
and
*NL*
railroad
tracks
;
and
then
Jurgis
lifted
up
his
head
and
began
to
sniff
*NL*
the
air
like
a
startled
animal
--
scenting
the
far-off
odor
of
home
.
It
*NL*
was
late
afternoon
then
,
and
he
was
hungry
,
but
the
dinner
invitations
*NL*
hung
out
of
the
saloons
were
not
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
came
at
last
to
the
stockyards
,
to
the
black
volcanoes
of
smoke
*NL*
and
the
lowing
cattle
and
the
stench
.
Then
,
seeing
a
crowded
car
,
his
*NL*
impatience
got
the
better
of
him
and
he
jumped
aboard
,
hiding
behind
*NL*
another
man
,
unnoticed
by
the
conductor
.
In
ten
minutes
more
he
had
*NL*
reached
his
street
,
and
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
half
running
as
he
came
round
the
corner
.
There
was
the
house
,
at
*NL*
any
rate
--
and
then
suddenly
he
stopped
and
stared
.
What
was
the
matter
*NL*
with
the
house
?
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
looked
twice
,
bewildered
;
then
he
glanced
at
the
house
next
door
*NL*
and
at
the
one
beyond
--
then
at
the
saloon
on
the
corner
.
Yes
,
it
was
*NL*
the
right
place
,
quite
certainly
--
he
had
not
made
any
mistake
.
But
the
*NL*
house
--
the
house
was
a
different
color
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
a
couple
of
steps
nearer
.
Yes
;
it
had
been
gray
and
now
it
was
*NL*
yellow
!
The
trimmings
around
the
windows
had
been
red
,
and
now
they
were
*NL*
green
!
It
was
all
newly
painted
!
How
strange
it
made
it
seem
!
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
went
closer
yet
,
but
keeping
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
.
*NL*
A
sudden
and
horrible
spasm
of
fear
had
come
over
him
.
His
knees
were
*NL*
shaking
beneath
him
,
and
his
mind
was
in
a
whirl
.
New
paint
on
the
*NL*
house
,
and
new
weatherboards
,
where
the
old
had
begun
to
rot
off
,
and
*NL*
the
agent
had
got
after
them
!
New
shingles
over
the
hole
in
the
roof
,
*NL*
too
,
the
hole
that
had
for
six
months
been
the
bane
of
his
soul
--
he
*NL*
having
no
money
to
have
it
fixed
and
no
time
to
fix
it
himself
,
and
the
*NL*
rain
leaking
in
,
and
overflowing
the
pots
and
pans
he
put
to
catch
it
,
*NL*
and
flooding
the
attic
and
loosening
the
plaster
.
And
now
it
was
fixed
!
*NL*
And
the
broken
windowpane
replaced
!
And
curtains
in
the
windows
!
New
,
*NL*
white
curtains
,
stiff
and
shiny
!
*NL*
*NL*
Then
suddenly
the
front
door
opened
.
Jurgis
stood
,
his
chest
heaving
as
*NL*
he
struggled
to
catch
his
breath
.
A
boy
had
come
out
,
a
stranger
to
him
;
*NL*
a
big
,
fat
,
rosy-cheeked
youngster
,
such
as
had
never
been
seen
in
his
*NL*
home
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
stared
at
the
boy
,
fascinated
.
He
came
down
the
steps
whistling
,
*NL*
kicking
off
the
snow
.
He
stopped
at
the
foot
,
and
picked
up
some
,
and
*NL*
then
leaned
against
the
railing
,
making
a
snowball
.
A
moment
later
*NL*
he
looked
around
and
saw
Jurgis
,
and
their
eyes
met
;
it
was
a
hostile
*NL*
glance
,
the
boy
evidently
thinking
that
the
other
had
suspicions
of
the
*NL*
snowball
.
When
Jurgis
started
slowly
across
the
street
toward
him
,
he
*NL*
gave
a
quick
glance
about
,
meditating
retreat
,
but
then
he
concluded
to
*NL*
stand
his
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
took
hold
of
the
railing
of
the
steps
,
for
he
was
a
little
*NL*
unsteady
.
``
What
--
what
are
you
doing
here
?
''
he
managed
to
gasp
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
on
!
''
said
the
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
--
''
Jurgis
tried
again
.
``
What
do
you
want
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Me
?
''
answered
the
boy
,
angrily
.
``
I
live
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
live
here
!
''
Jurgis
panted
.
He
turned
white
and
clung
more
tightly
*NL*
to
the
railing
.
``
You
live
here
!
Then
where
's
my
family
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
looked
surprised
.
``
Your
family
!
''
he
echoed
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Jurgis
started
toward
him
.
``
I
--
this
is
my
house
!
''
he
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
off
!
''
said
the
boy
;
then
suddenly
the
door
upstairs
opened
,
and
he
*NL*
called
:
``
Hey
,
ma
!
Here
's
a
fellow
says
he
owns
this
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
stout
Irishwoman
came
to
the
top
of
the
steps
.
``
What
's
that
?
''
she
*NL*
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
turned
toward
her
.
``
Where
is
my
family
?
''
he
cried
,
wildly
.
``
I
*NL*
left
them
here
!
This
is
my
home
!
What
are
you
doing
in
my
home
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
stared
at
him
in
frightened
wonder
,
she
must
have
thought
*NL*
she
was
dealing
with
a
maniac
--
Jurgis
looked
like
one
.
``
Your
home
!
''
she
*NL*
echoed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
home
!
''
he
half
shrieked
.
``
I
lived
here
,
I
tell
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
be
mistaken
,
''
she
answered
him
.
``
No
one
ever
lived
here
.
This
*NL*
is
a
new
house
.
They
told
us
so
.
They
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
they
done
with
my
family
?
''
shouted
Jurgis
,
frantically
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
light
had
begun
to
break
upon
the
woman
;
perhaps
she
had
had
doubts
of
*NL*
what
``
they
''
had
told
her
.
``
I
do
n't
know
where
your
family
is
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
``
I
bought
the
house
only
three
days
ago
,
and
there
was
nobody
here
,
and
*NL*
they
told
me
it
was
all
new
.
Do
you
really
mean
you
had
ever
rented
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rented
it
!
''
panted
Jurgis
.
``
I
bought
it
!
I
paid
for
it
!
I
own
it
!
And
*NL*
they
--
my
God
,
ca
n't
you
tell
me
where
my
people
went
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
made
him
understand
at
last
that
she
knew
nothing
.
Jurgis
'
brain
*NL*
was
so
confused
that
he
could
not
grasp
the
situation
.
It
was
as
if
his
*NL*
family
had
been
wiped
out
of
existence
;
as
if
they
were
proving
to
be
*NL*
dream
people
,
who
never
had
existed
at
all
.
He
was
quite
lost
--
but
then
*NL*
suddenly
he
thought
of
Grandmother
Majauszkiene
,
who
lived
in
the
next
*NL*
block
.
She
would
know
!
He
turned
and
started
at
a
run
.
*NL*
*NL*
Grandmother
Majauszkiene
came
to
the
door
herself
.
She
cried
out
when
*NL*
she
saw
Jurgis
,
wild-eyed
and
shaking
.
Yes
,
yes
,
she
could
tell
him
.
The
*NL*
family
had
moved
;
they
had
not
been
able
to
pay
the
rent
and
they
had
*NL*
been
turned
out
into
the
snow
,
and
the
house
had
been
repainted
and
sold
*NL*
again
the
next
week
.
No
,
she
had
not
heard
how
they
were
,
but
she
could
*NL*
tell
him
that
they
had
gone
back
to
Aniele
Jukniene
,
with
whom
they
had
*NL*
stayed
when
they
first
came
to
the
yards
.
Would
n't
Jurgis
come
in
and
*NL*
rest
?
It
was
certainly
too
bad
--
if
only
he
had
not
got
into
jail
--
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
Jurgis
turned
and
staggered
away
.
He
did
not
go
very
far
round
*NL*
the
corner
he
gave
out
completely
,
and
sat
down
on
the
steps
of
a
*NL*
saloon
,
and
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
,
and
shook
all
over
with
dry
,
*NL*
racking
sobs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
home
!
Their
home
!
They
had
lost
it
!
Grief
,
despair
,
rage
,
*NL*
overwhelmed
him
--
what
was
any
imagination
of
the
thing
to
this
*NL*
heartbreaking
,
crushing
reality
of
it
--
to
the
sight
of
strange
people
*NL*
living
in
his
house
,
hanging
their
curtains
to
his
windows
,
staring
at
*NL*
him
with
hostile
eyes
!
It
was
monstrous
,
it
was
unthinkable
--
they
could
*NL*
not
do
it
--
it
could
not
be
true
!
Only
think
what
he
had
suffered
for
*NL*
that
house
--
what
miseries
they
had
all
suffered
for
it
--
the
price
they
*NL*
had
paid
for
it
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
long
agony
came
back
to
him
.
Their
sacrifices
in
the
*NL*
beginning
,
their
three
hundred
dollars
that
they
had
scraped
together
,
*NL*
all
they
owned
in
the
world
,
all
that
stood
between
them
and
starvation
!
*NL*
And
then
their
toil
,
month
by
month
,
to
get
together
the
twelve
dollars
,
*NL*
and
the
interest
as
well
,
and
now
and
then
the
taxes
,
and
the
other
*NL*
charges
,
and
the
repairs
,
and
what
not
!
Why
,
they
had
put
their
very
*NL*
souls
into
their
payments
on
that
house
,
they
had
paid
for
it
with
their
*NL*
sweat
and
tears
--
yes
,
more
,
with
their
very
lifeblood
.
Dede
Antanas
had
*NL*
died
of
the
struggle
to
earn
that
money
--
he
would
have
been
alive
and
*NL*
strong
today
if
he
had
not
had
to
work
in
Durham
's
dark
cellars
to
earn
*NL*
his
share
.
And
Ona
,
too
,
had
given
her
health
and
strength
to
pay
for
*NL*
it
--
she
was
wrecked
and
ruined
because
of
it
;
and
so
was
he
,
who
had
*NL*
been
a
big
,
strong
man
three
years
ago
,
and
now
sat
here
shivering
,
*NL*
broken
,
cowed
,
weeping
like
a
hysterical
child
.
Ah
!
they
had
cast
their
*NL*
all
into
the
fight
;
and
they
had
lost
,
they
had
lost
!
All
that
they
had
*NL*
paid
was
gone
--
every
cent
of
it
.
And
their
house
was
gone
--
they
were
*NL*
back
where
they
had
started
from
,
flung
out
into
the
cold
to
starve
and
*NL*
freeze
!
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
could
see
all
the
truth
now
--
could
see
himself
,
through
the
whole
*NL*
long
course
of
events
,
the
victim
of
ravenous
vultures
that
had
torn
*NL*
into
his
vitals
and
devoured
him
;
of
fiends
that
had
racked
and
tortured
*NL*
him
,
mocking
him
,
meantime
,
jeering
in
his
face
.
Ah
,
God
,
the
horror
*NL*
of
it
,
the
monstrous
,
hideous
,
demoniacal
wickedness
of
it
!
He
and
his
*NL*
family
,
helpless
women
and
children
,
struggling
to
live
,
ignorant
and
*NL*
defenseless
and
forlorn
as
they
were
--
and
the
enemies
that
had
been
*NL*
lurking
for
them
,
crouching
upon
their
trail
and
thirsting
for
their
*NL*
blood
!
That
first
lying
circular
,
that
smooth-tongued
slippery
agent
!
*NL*
That
trap
of
the
extra
payments
,
the
interest
,
and
all
the
other
charges
*NL*
that
they
had
not
the
means
to
pay
,
and
would
never
have
attempted
to
*NL*
pay
!
And
then
all
the
tricks
of
the
packers
,
their
masters
,
the
tyrants
*NL*
who
ruled
them
--
the
shutdowns
and
the
scarcity
of
work
,
the
irregular
*NL*
hours
and
the
cruel
speeding-up
,
the
lowering
of
wages
,
the
raising
of
*NL*
prices
!
The
mercilessness
of
nature
about
them
,
of
heat
and
cold
,
rain
*NL*
and
snow
;
the
mercilessness
of
the
city
,
of
the
country
in
which
they
*NL*
lived
,
of
its
laws
and
customs
that
they
did
not
understand
!
All
of
*NL*
these
things
had
worked
together
for
the
company
that
had
marked
them
*NL*
for
its
prey
and
was
waiting
for
its
chance
.
And
now
,
with
this
last
*NL*
hideous
injustice
,
its
time
had
come
,
and
it
had
turned
them
out
bag
*NL*
and
baggage
,
and
taken
their
house
and
sold
it
again
!
And
they
could
*NL*
do
nothing
,
they
were
tied
hand
and
foot
--
the
law
was
against
them
,
the
*NL*
whole
machinery
of
society
was
at
their
oppressors
'
command
!
If
Jurgis
*NL*
so
much
as
raised
a
hand
against
them
,
back
he
would
go
into
that
*NL*
wild-beast
pen
from
which
he
had
just
escaped
!
*NL*
*NL*
To
get
up
and
go
away
was
to
give
up
,
to
acknowledge
defeat
,
to
leave
*NL*
the
strange
family
in
possession
;
and
Jurgis
might
have
sat
shivering
*NL*
in
the
rain
for
hours
before
he
could
do
that
,
had
it
not
been
for
*NL*
the
thought
of
his
family
.
It
might
be
that
he
had
worse
things
yet
to
*NL*
learn
--
and
so
he
got
to
his
feet
and
started
away
,
walking
on
,
wearily
,
*NL*
half-dazed
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
Aniele
's
house
,
in
back
of
the
yards
,
was
a
good
two
miles
;
the
*NL*
distance
had
never
seemed
longer
to
Jurgis
,
and
when
he
saw
the
familiar
*NL*
dingy-gray
shanty
his
heart
was
beating
fast
.
He
ran
up
the
steps
and
*NL*
began
to
hammer
upon
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
woman
herself
came
to
open
it
.
She
had
shrunk
all
up
with
her
*NL*
rheumatism
since
Jurgis
had
seen
her
last
,
and
her
yellow
parchment
face
*NL*
stared
up
at
him
from
a
little
above
the
level
of
the
doorknob
.
She
gave
*NL*
a
start
when
she
saw
him
.
``
Is
Ona
here
?
''
he
cried
,
breathlessly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
was
the
answer
,
``
she
's
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
--
''
Jurgis
began
,
and
then
stopped
short
,
clutching
convulsively
at
*NL*
the
side
of
the
door
.
From
somewhere
within
the
house
had
come
a
sudden
*NL*
cry
,
a
wild
,
horrible
scream
of
anguish
.
And
the
voice
was
Ona
's
.
For
a
*NL*
moment
Jurgis
stood
half-paralyzed
with
fright
;
then
he
bounded
past
the
*NL*
old
woman
and
into
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Aniele
's
kitchen
,
and
huddled
round
the
stove
were
half
a
dozen
*NL*
women
,
pale
and
frightened
.
One
of
them
started
to
her
feet
as
Jurgis
*NL*
entered
;
she
was
haggard
and
frightfully
thin
,
with
one
arm
tied
up
in
*NL*
bandages
--
he
hardly
realized
that
it
was
Marija
.
He
looked
first
for
*NL*
Ona
;
then
,
not
seeing
her
,
he
stared
at
the
women
,
expecting
them
to
*NL*
speak
.
But
they
sat
dumb
,
gazing
back
at
him
,
panic-stricken
;
and
a
*NL*
second
later
came
another
piercing
scream
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
from
the
rear
of
the
house
,
and
upstairs
.
Jurgis
bounded
to
a
*NL*
door
of
the
room
and
flung
it
open
;
there
was
a
ladder
leading
through
*NL*
a
trap
door
to
the
garret
,
and
he
was
at
the
foot
of
it
when
suddenly
he
*NL*
heard
a
voice
behind
him
,
and
saw
Marija
at
his
heels
.
She
seized
him
by
*NL*
the
sleeve
with
her
good
hand
,
panting
wildly
,
``
No
,
no
,
Jurgis
!
Stop
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
''
he
gasped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
n't
go
up
,
''
she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
was
half-crazed
with
bewilderment
and
fright
.
``
What
's
the
*NL*
matter
?
''
he
shouted
.
``
What
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marija
clung
to
him
tightly
;
he
could
hear
Ona
sobbing
and
moaning
*NL*
above
,
and
he
fought
to
get
away
and
climb
up
,
without
waiting
for
her
*NL*
reply
.
``
No
,
no
,
''
she
rushed
on
.
``
Jurgis
!
You
must
n't
go
up
!
It
's
--
it
's
*NL*
the
child
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
child
?
''
he
echoed
in
perplexity
.
``
Antanas
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marija
answered
him
,
in
a
whisper
:
``
The
new
one
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
Jurgis
went
limp
,
and
caught
himself
on
the
ladder
.
He
stared
*NL*
at
her
as
if
she
were
a
ghost
.
``
The
new
one
!
''
he
gasped
.
``
But
it
is
n't
*NL*
time
,
''
he
added
,
wildly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marija
nodded
.
``
I
know
,
''
she
said
;
``
but
it
's
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
again
came
Ona
's
scream
,
smiting
him
like
a
blow
in
the
face
,
*NL*
making
him
wince
and
turn
white
.
Her
voice
died
away
into
a
wail
--
then
*NL*
he
heard
her
sobbing
again
,
``
My
God
--
let
me
die
,
let
me
die
!
''
And
Marija
*NL*
hung
her
arms
about
him
,
crying
:
``
Come
out
!
Come
away
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
She
dragged
him
back
into
the
kitchen
,
half
carrying
him
,
for
he
had
*NL*
gone
all
to
pieces
.
It
was
as
if
the
pillars
of
his
soul
had
fallen
*NL*
in
--
he
was
blasted
with
horror
.
In
the
room
he
sank
into
a
chair
,
*NL*
trembling
like
a
leaf
,
Marija
still
holding
him
,
and
the
women
staring
*NL*
at
him
in
dumb
,
helpless
fright
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
again
Ona
cried
out
;
he
could
hear
it
nearly
as
plainly
here
,
*NL*
and
he
staggered
to
his
feet
.
``
How
long
has
this
been
going
on
?
''
he
*NL*
panted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
very
long
,
''
Marija
answered
,
and
then
,
at
a
signal
from
Aniele
,
she
*NL*
rushed
on
:
``
You
go
away
,
Jurgis
you
ca
n't
help
--
go
away
and
come
back
*NL*
later
.
It
's
all
right
--
it
's
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
with
her
?
''
Jurgis
demanded
;
and
then
,
seeing
Marija
hesitating
,
*NL*
he
cried
again
,
``
Who
's
with
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
--
she
's
all
right
,
''
she
answered
.
``
Elzbieta
's
with
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
doctor
!
''
he
panted
.
``
Some
one
who
knows
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
seized
Marija
by
the
arm
;
she
trembled
,
and
her
voice
sank
beneath
a
*NL*
whisper
as
she
replied
,
``
We
--
we
have
no
money
.
''
Then
,
frightened
at
*NL*
the
look
on
his
face
,
she
exclaimed
:
``
It
's
all
right
,
Jurgis
!
You
do
n't
*NL*
understand
--
go
away
--
go
away
!
Ah
,
if
you
only
had
waited
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Above
her
protests
Jurgis
heard
Ona
again
;
he
was
almost
out
of
his
*NL*
mind
.
It
was
all
new
to
him
,
raw
and
horrible
--
it
had
fallen
upon
him
*NL*
like
a
lightning
stroke
.
When
little
Antanas
was
born
he
had
been
at
*NL*
work
,
and
had
known
nothing
about
it
until
it
was
over
;
and
now
he
was
*NL*
not
to
be
controlled
.
The
frightened
women
were
at
their
wits
'
end
;
one
*NL*
after
another
they
tried
to
reason
with
him
,
to
make
him
understand
that
*NL*
this
was
the
lot
of
woman
.
In
the
end
they
half
drove
him
out
into
*NL*
the
rain
,
where
he
began
to
pace
up
and
down
,
bareheaded
and
frantic
.
*NL*
Because
he
could
hear
Ona
from
the
street
,
he
would
first
go
away
to
*NL*
escape
the
sounds
,
and
then
come
back
because
he
could
not
help
it
.
At
*NL*
the
end
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
rushed
up
the
steps
again
,
and
for
*NL*
fear
that
he
would
break
in
the
door
they
had
to
open
it
and
let
him
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
arguing
with
him
.
They
could
not
tell
him
that
all
was
*NL*
going
well
--
how
could
they
know
,
he
cried
--
why
,
she
was
dying
,
she
was
*NL*
being
torn
to
pieces
!
Listen
to
her
--
listen
!
Why
,
it
was
monstrous
--
it
*NL*
could
not
be
allowed
--
there
must
be
some
help
for
it
!
Had
they
tried
to
*NL*
get
a
doctor
?
They
might
pay
him
afterward
--
they
could
promise
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
could
n't
promise
,
Jurgis
,
''
protested
Marija
.
``
We
had
no
money
--
we
*NL*
have
scarcely
been
able
to
keep
alive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
can
work
,
''
Jurgis
exclaimed
.
``
I
can
earn
money
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
answered
--
``
but
we
thought
you
were
in
jail
.
How
could
we
know
*NL*
when
you
would
return
?
They
will
not
work
for
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marija
went
on
to
tell
how
she
had
tried
to
find
a
midwife
,
and
how
they
*NL*
had
demanded
ten
,
fifteen
,
even
twenty-five
dollars
,
and
that
in
cash
.
*NL*
``
And
I
had
only
a
quarter
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
have
spent
every
cent
of
my
*NL*
money
--
all
that
I
had
in
the
bank
;
and
I
owe
the
doctor
who
has
been
*NL*
coming
to
see
me
,
and
he
has
stopped
because
he
thinks
I
do
n't
mean
*NL*
to
pay
him
.
And
we
owe
Aniele
for
two
weeks
'
rent
,
and
she
is
nearly
*NL*
starving
,
and
is
afraid
of
being
turned
out
.
We
have
been
borrowing
and
*NL*
begging
to
keep
alive
,
and
there
is
nothing
more
we
can
do
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
children
?
''
cried
Jurgis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
children
have
not
been
home
for
three
days
,
the
weather
has
been
so
*NL*
bad
.
They
could
not
know
what
is
happening
--
it
came
suddenly
,
two
months
*NL*
before
we
expected
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
was
standing
by
the
table
,
and
he
caught
himself
with
his
hand
;
*NL*
his
head
sank
and
his
arms
shook
--
it
looked
as
if
he
were
going
to
*NL*
collapse
.
Then
suddenly
Aniele
got
up
and
came
hobbling
toward
him
,
*NL*
fumbling
in
her
skirt
pocket
.
She
drew
out
a
dirty
rag
,
in
one
corner
of
*NL*
which
she
had
something
tied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
Jurgis
!
''
she
said
,
``
I
have
some
money
.
Palauk
!
See
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
unwrapped
it
and
counted
it
out
--
thirty-four
cents
.
``
You
go
,
now
,
''
*NL*
she
said
,
``
and
try
and
get
somebody
yourself
.
And
maybe
the
rest
can
*NL*
help
--
give
him
some
money
,
you
;
he
will
pay
you
back
some
day
,
and
it
*NL*
will
do
him
good
to
have
something
to
think
about
,
even
if
he
does
n't
*NL*
succeed
.
When
he
comes
back
,
maybe
it
will
be
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
the
other
women
turned
out
the
contents
of
their
pocketbooks
;
*NL*
most
of
them
had
only
pennies
and
nickels
,
but
they
gave
him
all
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Olszewski
,
who
lived
next
door
,
and
had
a
husband
who
was
a
skilled
*NL*
cattle
butcher
,
but
a
drinking
man
,
gave
nearly
half
a
dollar
,
enough
*NL*
to
raise
the
whole
sum
to
a
dollar
and
a
quarter
.
Then
Jurgis
thrust
it
*NL*
into
his
pocket
,
still
holding
it
tightly
in
his
fist
,
and
started
away
*NL*
at
a
run
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
Haupt
Hebamme
''
,
ran
a
sign
,
swinging
from
a
second-story
window
*NL*
over
a
saloon
on
the
avenue
;
at
a
side
door
was
another
sign
,
with
a
*NL*
hand
pointing
up
a
dingy
flight
of
stairs
.
Jurgis
went
up
them
,
three
at
*NL*
a
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Haupt
was
frying
pork
and
onions
,
and
had
her
door
half
open
to
*NL*
let
out
the
smoke
.
When
he
tried
to
knock
upon
it
,
it
swung
open
the
*NL*
rest
of
the
way
,
and
he
had
a
glimpse
of
her
,
with
a
black
bottle
turned
*NL*
up
to
her
lips
.
Then
he
knocked
louder
,
and
she
started
and
put
it
away
.
*NL*
She
was
a
Dutchwoman
,
enormously
fat
--
when
she
walked
she
rolled
like
*NL*
a
small
boat
on
the
ocean
,
and
the
dishes
in
the
cupboard
jostled
each
*NL*
other
.
She
wore
a
filthy
blue
wrapper
,
and
her
teeth
were
black
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Vot
is
it
?
''
she
said
,
when
she
saw
Jurgis
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
run
like
mad
all
the
way
and
was
so
out
of
breath
he
could
hardly
*NL*
speak
.
His
hair
was
flying
and
his
eyes
wild
--
he
looked
like
a
man
that
*NL*
had
risen
from
the
tomb
.
``
My
wife
!
''
he
panted
.
``
Come
quickly
!
''
Madame
*NL*
Haupt
set
the
frying
pan
to
one
side
and
wiped
her
hands
on
her
wrapper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
vant
me
to

she

*NL*

Jurgis

*NL*
*NL*
``

Still

*NL*
``

*NL*
``

Jurgis
stammered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tventy-five

His
face
fell
.
``
I
ca

he
said

*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
was
watching
him
narrowly
.
``
How

do
you
pay

''
she
*NL*
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Must

*NL*
``

*NL*
``

Jurgis
began
in
an
agony
of
dread

``
I

He
could
hardly
bring
himself
to
reply
.
When
he
said
``
A
dollar
and
a
*NL*
quarter

the
woman
laughed
in
his
face

*NL*
*NL*
``

his

breaking

*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Haupt
had
put
back
her
pork
and
onions
on
the
stove
.
She
turned
*NL*
to
him
and
answered
,
out
of
the
steam
and
noise
:
``
Git
me
ten
dollars

The

turned
to

Jurgis
cried

down

his
knees

''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Haupt
was
pointing
her
cooking-fork
at
Jurgis
persuasively
;
but
*NL*
her
words
were
more
than
he
could
bear
.
He
flung
up
his
hands
with
*NL*
a
gesture
of
despair
and
turned
and
started
away
.
``
It
's
no
use
,
''
he
*NL*
exclaimed
--
but
suddenly
he
heard
the
woman
's
voice
behind
him
again
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
vill
make
it
five
dollars
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
followed
behind
him
,
arguing
with
him
.
``
You
vill
be
foolish
not
to
*NL*
take
such
an
offer
,
''
she
said
.
``
You

''
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
interrupted
her
with
an
oath
of
rage
.
``
If
I
have
n't
got
it
,
''
he
*NL*
shouted
,
``
how
can
I
pay
it
?
Damn
it
,
I
would
pay
you
if
I
could

but
I
*NL*

Do
you
hear
me
I
have
n't
*NL*
got

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
and
started
away
again
.
He
was
halfway
down
the
stairs
before
*NL*
Madame
Haupt
could
shout
to
him
:
``
Vait
!
I
vill
go
mit
you
!
Come
back
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
back
into
the
room
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
goot
to
tink
of
anybody
suffering
,
''
she
said
,
in
a
melancholy
*NL*
voice
.
``
I

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
As

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
within
a

''
said
poor
Jurgis
.
``
Anything

Hurry
up
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Vere
is
de
dollar
und
a
quarter
?
''
persisted
Madame
Haupt
,
relentlessly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
put
the
money
on
the
table
and
the
woman
counted
it
and
stowed
it
*NL*
away
.
Then
she
wiped
her
greasy
hands
again
and
proceeded
to
get
ready
,
*NL*
complaining
all
the
time
;
she
was
so
fat
that
it
was
painful
for
her
to
*NL*
move
,
and
she
grunted
and
gasped
at
every
step
.
She
took
off
her
wrapper
*NL*
without
even
taking
the
trouble
to
turn
her
back
to
Jurgis
,
and
put
on
*NL*
her
corsets
and
dress
.
Then
there
was
a
black
bonnet
which
had
to
be
*NL*
adjusted
carefully
,
and
an
umbrella
which
was
mislaid
,
and
a
bag
full
of
*NL*
necessaries
which
had
to
be
collected
from
here
and
there
--
the
man
being
*NL*
nearly
crazy
with
anxiety
in
the
meantime
.
When
they
were
on
the
street
*NL*
he
kept
about
four
paces
ahead
of
her
,
turning
now
and
then
,
as
if
he
*NL*
could
hurry
her
on
by
the
force
of
his
desire
.
But
Madame
Haupt
could
*NL*
only
go
so
far
at
a
step
,
and
it
took
all
her
attention
to
get
the
*NL*
needed
breath
for
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
came
at
last
to
the
house
,
and
to
the
group
of
frightened
women
in
*NL*
the
kitchen
.
It
was
not
over
yet
,
Jurgis
learned
--
he
heard
Ona
crying
*NL*
still
;
and
meantime
Madame
Haupt
removed
her
bonnet
and
laid
it
on
*NL*
the
mantelpiece
,
and
got
out
of
her
bag
,
first
an
old
dress
and
then
a
*NL*
saucer
of
goose
grease
,
which
she
proceeded
to
rub
upon
her
hands
.
The
*NL*
more
cases
this
goose
grease
is
used
in
,
the
better
luck
it
brings
to
*NL*
the
midwife
,
and
so
she
keeps
it
upon
her
kitchen
mantelpiece
or
stowed
*NL*
away
in
a
cupboard
with
her
dirty
clothes
,
for
months
,
and
sometimes
*NL*
even
for
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
they
escorted
her
to
the
ladder
,
and
Jurgis
heard
her
give
an
*NL*
exclamation
of
dismay
.
``
Gott
in
Himmel
,
vot
for
haf
you
brought
me
to
a
*NL*
place
like
dis
?
I
could
not
climb
up
dot
ladder
.
I
could
not
git
troo
a
*NL*
trap
door
!
I
vill
not
try
it
--
vy
,
I
might
kill
myself
already
.
Vot
sort
*NL*
of
a
place
is
dot
for
a
woman
to
bear
a
child
in
--
up
in
a
garret
,
mit
*NL*
only
a
ladder
to
it
?
You
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourselves
!
''
Jurgis
*NL*
stood
in
the
doorway
and
listened
to
her
scolding
,
half
drowning
out
the
*NL*
horrible
moans
and
screams
of
Ona
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
Aniele
succeeded
in
pacifying
her
,
and
she
essayed
the
ascent
;
*NL*
then
,
however
,
she
had
to
be
stopped
while
the
old
woman
cautioned
her
*NL*
about
the
floor
of
the
garret
.
They
had
no
real
floor
--
they
had
laid
old
*NL*
boards
in
one
part
to
make
a
place
for
the
family
to
live
;
it
was
all
*NL*
right
and
safe
there
,
but
the
other
part
of
the
garret
had
only
the
*NL*
joists
of
the
floor
,
and
the
lath
and
plaster
of
the
ceiling
below
,
and
*NL*
if
one
stepped
on
this
there
would
be
a
catastrophe
.
As
it
was
half
dark
*NL*
up
above
,
perhaps
one
of
the
others
had
best
go
up
first
with
a
candle
.
*NL*
Then
there
were
more
outcries
and
threatening
,
until
at
last
Jurgis
had
*NL*
a
vision
of
a
pair
of
elephantine
legs
disappearing
through
the
trap
*NL*
door
,
and
felt
the
house
shake
as
Madame
Haupt
started
to
walk
.
Then
*NL*
suddenly
Aniele
came
to
him
and
took
him
by
the
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
she
said
,
``
you
go
away
.
Do
as
I
tell
you
--
you
have
done
all
you
*NL*
can
,
and
you
are
only
in
the
way
.
Go
away
and
stay
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
where
shall
I
go
?
''
Jurgis
asked
,
helplessly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
where
,
''
she
answered
.
``
Go
on
the
street
,
if
there
is
no
*NL*
other
place
--
only
go
!
And
stay
all
night
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
end
she
and
Marija
pushed
him
out
of
the
door
and
shut
it
behind
*NL*
him
.
It
was
just
about
sundown
,
and
it
was
turning
cold
--
the
rain
had
*NL*
changed
to
snow
,
and
the
slush
was
freezing
.
Jurgis
shivered
in
his
thin
*NL*
clothing
,
and
put
his
hands
into
his
pockets
and
started
away
.
He
had
*NL*
not
eaten
since
morning
,
and
he
felt
weak
and
ill
;
with
a
sudden
throb
*NL*
of
hope
he
recollected
he
was
only
a
few
blocks
from
the
saloon
where
he
*NL*
had
been
wont
to
eat
his
dinner
.
They
might
have
mercy
on
him
there
,
*NL*
or
he
might
meet
a
friend
.
He
set
out
for
the
place
as
fast
as
he
could
*NL*
walk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hello
,
Jack
,
''
said
the
saloon-keeper
,
when
he
entered
--
they
call
all
*NL*
foreigners
and
unskilled
men
``
Jack
''
in
Packingtown
.
``
Where
've
you
been
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
went
straight
to
the
bar
.
``
I
've
been
in
jail
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
I
've
*NL*
just
got
out
.
I
walked
home
all
the
way
,
and
I
've
not
a
cent
,
and
had
*NL*
nothing
to
eat
since
this
morning
.
And
I
've
lost
my
home
,
and
my
wife
's
*NL*
ill
,
and
I
'm
done
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
saloon-keeper
gazed
at
him
,
with
his
haggard
white
face
and
his
blue
*NL*
trembling
lips
.
Then
he
pushed
a
big
bottle
toward
him
.
``
Fill
her
up
!
''
*NL*
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
could
hardly
hold
the
bottle
,
his
hands
shook
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
afraid
,
''
said
the
saloon-keeper
,
``
fill
her
up
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
Jurgis
drank
a
large
glass
of
whisky
,
and
then
turned
to
the
lunch
*NL*
counter
,
in
obedience
to
the
other
's
suggestion
.
He
ate
all
he
dared
,
*NL*
stuffing
it
in
as
fast
as
he
could
;
and
then
,
after
trying
to
speak
his
*NL*
gratitude
,
he
went
and
sat
down
by
the
big
red
stove
in
the
middle
of
*NL*
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
too
good
to
last
,
however
--
like
all
things
in
this
hard
*NL*
world
.
His
soaked
clothing
began
to
steam
,
and
the
horrible
stench
of
*NL*
fertilizer
to
fill
the
room
.
In
an
hour
or
so
the
packing
houses
would
*NL*
be
closing
and
the
men
coming
in
from
their
work
;
and
they
would
not
*NL*
come
into
a
place
that
smelt
of
Jurgis
.
Also
it
was
Saturday
night
,
and
*NL*
in
a
couple
of
hours
would
come
a
violin
and
a
cornet
,
and
in
the
rear
*NL*
part
of
the
saloon
the
families
of
the
neighborhood
would
dance
and
*NL*
feast
upon
wienerwurst
and
lager
,
until
two
or
three
o'clock
in
the
*NL*
morning
.
The
saloon-keeper
coughed
once
or
twice
,
and
then
remarked
,
*NL*
``
Say
,
Jack
,
I
'm
afraid
you
'll
have
to
quit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
used
to
the
sight
of
human
wrecks
,
this
saloon-keeper
;
he
``
fired
''
*NL*
dozens
of
them
every
night
,
just
as
haggard
and
cold
and
forlorn
as
this
*NL*
one
.
But
they
were
all
men
who
had
given
up
and
been
counted
out
,
while
*NL*
Jurgis
was
still
in
the
fight
,
and
had
reminders
of
decency
about
him
.
*NL*
As
he
got
up
meekly
,
the
other
reflected
that
he
had
always
been
a
*NL*
steady
man
,
and
might
soon
be
a
good
customer
again
.
``
You
've
been
up
*NL*
against
it
,
I
see
,
''
he
said
.
``
Come
this
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
rear
of
the
saloon
were
the
cellar
stairs
.
There
was
a
door
above
*NL*
and
another
below
,
both
safely
padlocked
,
making
the
stairs
an
admirable
*NL*
place
to
stow
away
a
customer
who
might
still
chance
to
have
money
,
or
a
*NL*
political
light
whom
it
was
not
advisable
to
kick
out
of
doors
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
Jurgis
spent
the
night
.
The
whisky
had
only
half
warmed
him
,
and
he
*NL*
could
not
sleep
,
exhausted
as
he
was
;
he
would
nod
forward
,
and
then
*NL*
start
up
,
shivering
with
the
cold
,
and
begin
to
remember
again
.
Hour
*NL*
after
hour
passed
,
until
he
could
only
persuade
himself
that
it
was
not
*NL*
morning
by
the
sounds
of
music
and
laughter
and
singing
that
were
to
*NL*
be
heard
from
the
room
.
When
at
last
these
ceased
,
he
expected
that
he
*NL*
would
be
turned
out
into
the
street
;
as
this
did
not
happen
,
he
fell
to
*NL*
wondering
whether
the
man
had
forgotten
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
end
,
when
the
silence
and
suspense
were
no
longer
to
be
borne
,
*NL*
he
got
up
and
hammered
on
the
door
;
and
the
proprietor
came
,
yawning
*NL*
and
rubbing
his
eyes
.
He
was
keeping
open
all
night
,
and
dozing
between
*NL*
customers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
go
home
,
''
Jurgis
said
.
``
I
'm
worried
about
my
wife
--
I
ca
n't
*NL*
wait
any
longer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
the
hell
did
n't
you
say
so
before
?
''
said
the
man
.
``
I
thought
you
*NL*
did
n't
have
any
home
to
go
to
.
''
Jurgis
went
outside
.
It
was
four
o'clock
*NL*
in
the
morning
,
and
as
black
as
night
.
There
were
three
or
four
inches
*NL*
of
fresh
snow
on
the
ground
,
and
the
flakes
were
falling
thick
and
fast
.
*NL*
He
turned
toward
Aniele
's
and
started
at
a
run
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
light
burning
in
the
kitchen
window
and
the
blinds
were
*NL*
drawn
.
The
door
was
unlocked
and
Jurgis
rushed
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aniele
,
Marija
,
and
the
rest
of
the
women
were
huddled
about
the
*NL*
stove
,
exactly
as
before
;
with
them
were
several
newcomers
,
Jurgis
*NL*
noticed
--
also
he
noticed
that
the
house
was
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
answered
him
,
they
sat
staring
at
him
with
their
pale
faces
.
He
*NL*
cried
again
:
``
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
,
by
the
light
of
the
smoky
lamp
,
he
saw
Marija
who
sat
nearest
*NL*
him
,
shaking
her
head
slowly
.
``
Not
yet
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Jurgis
gave
a
cry
of
dismay
.
``
Not
yet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
Marija
's
head
shook
.
The
poor
fellow
stood
dumfounded
.
``
I
do
n't
*NL*
hear
her
,
''
he
gasped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
been
quiet
a
long
time
,
''
replied
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
another
pause
--
broken
suddenly
by
a
voice
from
the
attic
:
*NL*
``
Hello
,
there
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Several
of
the
women
ran
into
the
next
room
,
while
Marija
sprang
toward
*NL*
Jurgis
.
``
Wait
here
!
''
she
cried
,
and
the
two
stood
,
pale
and
trembling
,
*NL*
listening
.
In
a
few
moments
it
became
clear
that
Madame
Haupt
was
*NL*
engaged
in
descending
the
ladder
,
scolding
and
exhorting
again
,
while
*NL*
the
ladder
creaked
in
protest
.
In
a
moment
or
two
she
reached
the
*NL*
ground
,
angry
and
breathless
,
and
they
heard
her
coming
into
the
room
.
*NL*
Jurgis
gave
one
glance
at
her
,
and
then
turned
white
and
reeled
.
She
had
*NL*
her
jacket
off
,
like
one
of
the
workers
on
the
killing
beds
.
Her
hands
*NL*
and
arms
were
smeared
with
blood
,
and
blood
was
splashed
upon
her
*NL*
clothing
and
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
stood
breathing
hard
,
and
gazing
about
her
;
no
one
made
a
sound
.
``
I
*NL*
haf
done
my
best
,
''
she
began
suddenly
.
``
I
can
do
noffing
more
--
dere
is
*NL*
no
use
to
try
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
there
was
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
ai
n't
my
fault
,
''
she
said
.
``
You
had
ought
to
haf
had
a
doctor
,
und
*NL*
not
vaited
so
long
--
it
vas
too
late
already
ven
I
come
.
''
Once
more
there
*NL*
was
deathlike
stillness
.
Marija
was
clutching
Jurgis
with
all
the
power
*NL*
of
her
one
well
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
suddenly
Madame
Haupt
turned
to
Aniele
.
``
You
haf
not
got
something
*NL*
to
drink
,
hey
?
''
she
queried
.
``
Some
brandy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Aniele
shook
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Herr
Gott
!
''
exclaimed
Madame
Haupt
.
``
Such
people
!
Perhaps
you
vill
give
*NL*
me
someting

--
I
haf
had

it
vas
*NL*
like
dis
,
I
vould
never
haf
come
for
such
money
as
you
gif
me
.
''
At
this
*NL*
moment
she
chanced
to
look
round
,
and
saw
Jurgis
:
She
shook
her
finger
*NL*
at
him
.
``
You
understand
me
,
''
she
said
,
``
you
pays
me
dot
money

de
*NL*
same

It
is
not
my

''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Madame
Haupt
paused
for
a
moment
to
get
her
breath
;
and
Marija
,
*NL*
seeing
the
beads
of
sweat
on
Jurgis
's
forehead
,
and
feeling
the
*NL*
quivering
of
his
frame
,
broke
out
in
a
low
voice
:
``
How
is
Ona
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
she
?
''
echoed
Madame
Haupt
.
``
How
do
you
tink

can
be
ven
*NL*

I

*NL*
strong

if

treated

.
She
fight
hard
,
dot
girl
--
she
is
*NL*
not
yet
quite
dead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Jurgis
gave
a
frantic
scream
.
``
Dead
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
vill
die
,
of
course
,
''
said
the
other
angrily
.
``
Der
baby
is
dead
*NL*
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
garret
was
lighted
by
a
candle
stuck
upon
a
board
;
it
had
almost
*NL*
burned
itself
out
,
and
was
sputtering
and
smoking
as
Jurgis
rushed
up
*NL*
the
ladder
.
He
could
make
out
dimly
in
one
corner
a
pallet
of
rags
and
*NL*
old
blankets
,
spread
upon
the
floor
;
at
the
foot
of
it
was
a
crucifix
,
*NL*
and
near
it
a
priest
muttering
a
prayer
.
In
a
far
corner
crouched
*NL*
Elzbieta
,
moaning
and
wailing
.
Upon
the
pallet
lay
Ona
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
covered
with
a
blanket
,
but
he
could
see
her
shoulders
and
*NL*
one
arm
lying
bare
;
she
was
so
shrunken
he
would
scarcely
have
known
*NL*
her
--
she
was
all
but
a
skeleton
,
and
as
white
as
a
piece
of
chalk
.
Her
*NL*
eyelids
were
closed
,
and
she
lay
still
as
death
.
He
staggered
toward
her
*NL*
and
fell
upon
his
knees
with
a
cry
of
anguish
:
``
Ona
!
Ona
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
stir
.
He
caught
her
hand
in
his
,
and
began
to
clasp
*NL*
it
frantically
,
calling
:
``
Look
at
me
!
Answer
me
!
It
is
Jurgis
come
*NL*
back
--
do
n't
you
hear
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
the
faintest
quivering
of
the
eyelids
,
and
he
called
again
in
*NL*
frenzy
:
``
Ona
!
Ona
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
suddenly
her
eyes
opened
one
instant
.
One
instant
she
looked
at
*NL*
him
--
there
was
a
flash
of
recognition
between
them
,
he
saw
her
afar
off
,
*NL*
as
through
a
dim
vista
,
standing
forlorn
.
He
stretched
out
his
arms
to
*NL*
her
,
he
called
her
in
wild
despair
;
a
fearful
yearning
surged
up
in
him
,
*NL*
hunger
for
her
that
was
agony
,
desire
that
was
a
new
being
born
*NL*
within
him
,
tearing
his
heartstrings
,
torturing
him
.
But
it
was
all
in
*NL*
vain
--
she
faded
from
him
,
she
slipped
back
and
was
gone
.
And
a
wail
of
*NL*
anguish
burst
from
him
,
great
sobs
shook
all
his
frame
,
and
hot
tears
*NL*
ran
down
his
cheeks
and
fell
upon
her
.
He
clutched
her
hands
,
he
shook
*NL*
her
,
he
caught
her
in
his
arms
and
pressed
her
to
him
but
she
lay
cold
*NL*
and
still
--
she
was
gone
--
she
was
gone
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
word
rang
through
him
like
the
sound
of
a
bell
,
echoing
in
the
far
*NL*
depths
of
him
,
making
forgotten
chords
to
vibrate
,
old
shadowy
fears
to
*NL*
stir
--
fears
of
the
dark
,
fears
of
the
void
,
fears
of
annihilation
.
She
*NL*
was
dead
!
She
was
dead
!
He
would
never
see
her
again
,
never
hear
her
*NL*
again
!
An
icy
horror
of
loneliness
seized
him
;
he
saw
himself
standing
*NL*
apart
and
watching
all
the
world
fade
away
from
him
--
a
world
of
shadows
,
*NL*
of
fickle
dreams
.
He
was
like
a
little
child
,
in
his
fright
and
grief
;
*NL*
he
called
and
called
,
and
got
no
answer
,
and
his
cries
of
despair
echoed
*NL*
through
the
house
,
making
the
women
downstairs
draw
nearer
to
each
other
*NL*
in
fear
.
He
was
inconsolable
,
beside
himself
--
the
priest
came
and
laid
*NL*
his
hand
upon
his
shoulder
and
whispered
to
him
,
but
he
heard
not
a
*NL*
sound
.
He
was
gone
away
himself
,
stumbling
through
the
shadows
,
and
*NL*
groping
after
the
soul
that
had
fled
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
lay
.
The
gray
dawn
came
up
and
crept
into
the
attic
.
The
*NL*
priest
left
,
the
women
left
,
and
he
was
alone
with
the
still
,
white
*NL*
figure
--
quieter
now
,
but
moaning
and
shuddering
,
wrestling
with
the
*NL*
grisly
fiend
.
Now
and
then
he
would
raise
himself
and
stare
at
the
white
*NL*
mask
before
him
,
then
hide
his
eyes
because
he
could
not
bear
it
.
Dead
!
*NL*
dead
!
And
she
was
only
a
girl
,
she
was
barely
eighteen
!
Her
life
had
*NL*
hardly
begun
--
and
here
she
lay
murdered
--
mangled
,
tortured
to
death
!
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
morning
when
he
rose
up
and
came
down
into
the
kitchen
--
haggard
*NL*
and
ashen
gray
,
reeling
and
dazed
.
More
of
the
neighbors
had
come
in
,
*NL*
and
they
stared
at
him
in
silence
as
he
sank
down
upon
a
chair
by
the
*NL*
table
and
buried
his
face
in
his
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
minutes
later
the
front
door
opened
;
a
blast
of
cold
and
snow
*NL*
rushed
in
,
and
behind
it
little
Kotrina
,
breathless
from
running
,
and
*NL*
blue
with
the
cold
.
``
I
'm
home
again
!
''
she
exclaimed
.
``
I
could
hardly
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
,
seeing
Jurgis
,
she
stopped
with
an
exclamation
.
Looking
from
*NL*
one
to
another
she
saw
that
something
had
happened
,
and
she
asked
,
in
a
*NL*
lower
voice
:
``
What
's
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Before
anyone
could
reply
,
Jurgis
started
up
;
he
went
toward
her
,
*NL*
walking
unsteadily
.
``
Where
have
you
been
?
''
he
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Selling
papers
with
the
boys
,
''
she
said
.
``
The
snow
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
any
money
?
''
he
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nearly
three
dollars
,
Jurgis
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
it
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Kotrina
,
frightened
by
his
manner
,
glanced
at
the
others
.
``
Give
it
to
*NL*
me
!
''
he
commanded
again
,
and
she
put
her
hand
into
her
pocket
and
pulled
*NL*
out
a
lump
of
coins
tied
in
a
bit
of
rag
.
Jurgis
took
it
without
a
word
,
*NL*
and
went
out
of
the
door
and
down
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
Three
doors
away
was
a
saloon
.
``
Whisky
,
''
he
said
,
as
he
entered
,
and
as
*NL*
the
man
pushed
him
some
,
he
tore
at
the
rag
with
his
teeth
and
pulled
*NL*
out
half
a
dollar
.
``
How
much
is
the
bottle
?
''
he
said
.
``
I
want
to
get
*NL*
drunk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
20
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
But
a
big
man
can
not
stay
drunk
very
long
on
three
dollars
.
That
was
*NL*
Sunday
morning
,
and
Monday
night
Jurgis
came
home
,
sober
and
sick
,
*NL*
realizing
that
he
had
spent
every
cent
the
family
owned
,
and
had
not
*NL*
bought
a
single
instant
's
forgetfulness
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ona
was
not
yet
buried
;
but
the
police
had
been
notified
,
and
on
the
*NL*
morrow
they
would
put
the
body
in
a
pine
coffin
and
take
it
to
the
*NL*
potter
's
field
.
Elzbieta
was
out
begging
now
,
a
few
pennies
from
each
of
*NL*
the
neighbors
,
to
get
enough
to
pay
for
a
mass
for
her
;
and
the
children
*NL*
were
upstairs
starving
to
death
,
while
he
,
good-for-nothing
rascal
,
had
*NL*
been
spending
their
money
on
drink
.
So
spoke
Aniele
,
scornfully
,
and
*NL*
when
he
started
toward
the
fire
she
added
the
information
that
her
*NL*
kitchen
was
no
longer
for
him
to
fill
with
his
phosphate
stinks
.
She
*NL*
had
crowded
all
her
boarders
into
one
room
on
Ona
's
account
,
but
now
he
*NL*
could
go
up
in
the
garret
where
he
belonged
--
and
not
there
much
longer
,
*NL*
either
,
if
he
did
not
pay
her
some
rent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
went
without
a
word
,
and
,
stepping
over
half
a
dozen
sleeping
*NL*
boarders
in
the
next
room
,
ascended
the
ladder
.
It
was
dark
up
above
;
*NL*
they
could
not
afford
any
light
;
also
it
was
nearly
as
cold
as
outdoors
.
*NL*
In
a
corner
,
as
far
away
from
the
corpse
as
possible
,
sat
Marija
,
*NL*
holding
little
Antanas
in
her
one
good
arm
and
trying
to
soothe
him
to
*NL*
sleep
.
In
another
corner
crouched
poor
little
Juozapas
,
wailing
because
*NL*
he
had
had
nothing
to
eat
all
day
.
Marija
said
not
a
word
to
Jurgis
;
he
*NL*
crept
in
like
a
whipped
cur
,
and
went
and
sat
down
by
the
body
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
he
ought
to
have
meditated
upon
the
hunger
of
the
children
,
and
*NL*
upon
his
own
baseness
;
but
he
thought
only
of
Ona
,
he
gave
himself
up
*NL*
again
to
the
luxury
of
grief
.
He
shed
no
tears
,
being
ashamed
to
make
a
*NL*
sound
;
he
sat
motionless
and
shuddering
with
his
anguish
.
He
had
never
*NL*
dreamed
how
much
he
loved
Ona
,
until
now
that
she
was
gone
;
until
now
*NL*
that
he
sat
here
,
knowing
that
on
the
morrow
they
would
take
her
away
,
*NL*
and
that
he
would
never
lay
eyes
upon
her
again
--
never
all
the
days
*NL*
of
his
life
.
His
old
love
,
which
had
been
starved
to
death
,
beaten
to
*NL*
death
,
awoke
in
him
again
;
the
floodgates
of
memory
were
lifted
--
he
saw
*NL*
all
their
life
together
,
saw
her
as
he
had
seen
her
in
Lithuania
,
the
*NL*
first
day
at
the
fair
,
beautiful
as
the
flowers
,
singing
like
a
bird
.
He
*NL*
saw
her
as
he
had
married
her
,
with
all
her
tenderness
,
with
her
heart
*NL*
of
wonder
;
the
very
words
she
had
spoken
seemed
to
ring
now
in
his
ears
,
*NL*
the
tears
she
had
shed
to
be
wet
upon
his
cheek
.
The
long
,
cruel
battle
*NL*
with
misery
and
hunger
had
hardened
and
embittered
him
,
but
it
had
not
*NL*
changed
her
--
she
had
been
the
same
hungry
soul
to
the
end
,
stretching
*NL*
out
her
arms
to
him
,
pleading
with
him
,
begging
him
for
love
and
*NL*
tenderness
.
And
she
had
suffered
--
so
cruelly
she
had
suffered
,
such
*NL*
agonies
,
such
infamies
--
ah
,
God
,
the
memory
of
them
was
not
to
be
borne
.
*NL*
What
a
monster
of
wickedness
,
of
heartlessness
,
he
had
been
!
Every
angry
*NL*
word
that
he
had
ever
spoken
came
back
to
him
and
cut
him
like
a
knife
;
*NL*
every
selfish
act
that
he
had
done
--
with
what
torments
he
paid
for
them
*NL*
now
!
And
such
devotion
and
awe
as
welled
up
in
his
soul
--
now
that
it
*NL*
could
never
be
spoken
,
now
that
it
was
too
late
,
too
late
!
His
bosom-was
*NL*
choking
with
it
,
bursting
with
it
;
he
crouched
here
in
the
darkness
*NL*
beside
her
,
stretching
out
his
arms
to
her
--
and
she
was
gone
forever
,
*NL*
she
was
dead
!
He
could
have
screamed
aloud
with
the
horror
and
despair
*NL*
of
it
;
a
sweat
of
agony
beaded
his
forehead
,
yet
he
dared
not
make
a
*NL*
sound
--
he
scarcely
dared
to
breathe
,
because
of
his
shame
and
loathing
*NL*
of
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Late
at
night
came
Elzbieta
,
having
gotten
the
money
for
a
mass
,
and
*NL*
paid
for
it
in
advance
,
lest
she
should
be
tempted
too
sorely
at
home
.
*NL*
She
brought
also
a
bit
of
stale
rye
bread
that
some
one
had
given
her
,
*NL*
and
with
that
they
quieted
the
children
and
got
them
to
sleep
.
Then
she
*NL*
came
over
to
Jurgis
and
sat
down
beside
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
said
not
a
word
of
reproach
--
she
and
Marija
had
chosen
that
course
*NL*
before
;
she
would
only
plead
with
him
,
here
by
the
corpse
of
his
dead
*NL*
wife
.
Already
Elzbieta
had
choked
down
her
tears
,
grief
being
crowded
*NL*
out
of
her
soul
by
fear
.
She
had
to
bury
one
of
her
children
--
but
then
*NL*
she
had
done
it
three
times
before
,
and
each
time
risen
up
and
gone
back
*NL*
to
take
up
the
battle
for
the
rest
.
Elzbieta
was
one
of
the
primitive
*NL*
creatures
:
like
the
angleworm
,
which
goes
on
living
though
cut
in
half
;
*NL*
like
a
hen
,
which
,
deprived
of
her
chickens
one
by
one
,
will
mother
the
*NL*
last
that
is
left
her
.
She
did
this
because
it
was
her
nature
--
she
asked
*NL*
no
questions
about
the
justice
of
it
,
nor
the
worth-whileness
of
life
in
*NL*
which
destruction
and
death
ran
riot
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
this
old
common-sense
view
she
labored
to
impress
upon
Jurgis
,
*NL*
pleading
with
him
with
tears
in
her
eyes
.
Ona
was
dead
,
but
the
others
*NL*
were
left
and
they
must
be
saved
.
She
did
not
ask
for
her
own
children
.
*NL*
She
and
Marija
could
care
for
them
somehow
,
but
there
was
Antanas
,
his
*NL*
own
son
.
Ona
had
given
Antanas
to
him
--
the
little
fellow
was
the
only
*NL*
remembrance
of
her
that
he
had
;
he
must
treasure
it
and
protect
it
,
he
*NL*
must
show
himself
a
man
.
He
knew
what
Ona
would
have
had
him
do
,
what
*NL*
she
would
ask
of
him
at
this
moment
,
if
she
could
speak
to
him
.
It
was
*NL*
a
terrible
thing
that
she
should
have
died
as
she
had
;
but
the
life
had
*NL*
been
too
hard
for
her
,
and
she
had
to
go
.
It
was
terrible
that
they
*NL*
were
not
able
to
bury
her
,
that
he
could
not
even
have
a
day
to
mourn
*NL*
her
--
but
so
it
was
.
Their
fate
was
pressing
;
they
had
not
a
cent
,
and
*NL*
the
children
would
perish
--
some
money
must
be
had
.
Could
he
not
be
a
man
*NL*
for
Ona
's
sake
,
and
pull
himself
together
?
In
a
little
while
they
would
*NL*
be
out
of
danger
--
now
that
they
had
given
up
the
house
they
could
live
*NL*
more
cheaply
,
and
with
all
the
children
working
they
could
get
along
,
*NL*
if
only
he
would
not
go
to
pieces
.
So
Elzbieta
went
on
,
with
feverish
*NL*
intensity
.
It
was
a
struggle
for
life
with
her
;
she
was
not
afraid
that
*NL*
Jurgis
would
go
on
drinking
,
for
he
had
no
money
for
that
,
but
she
was
*NL*
wild
with
dread
at
the
thought
that
he
might
desert
them
,
might
take
to
*NL*
the
road
,
as
Jonas
had
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
with
Ona
's
dead
body
beneath
his
eyes
,
Jurgis
could
not
well
think
*NL*
of
treason
to
his
child
.
Yes
,
he
said
,
he
would
try
,
for
the
sake
of
*NL*
Antanas
.
He
would
give
the
little
fellow
his
chance
--
would
get
to
work
*NL*
at
once
,
yes
,
tomorrow
,
without
even
waiting
for
Ona
to
be
buried
.
They
*NL*
might
trust
him
,
he
would
keep
his
word
,
come
what
might
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
he
was
out
before
daylight
the
next
morning
,
headache
,
heartache
,
*NL*
and
all
.
He
went
straight
to
Graham
's
fertilizer
mill
,
to
see
if
he
*NL*
could
get
back
his
job
.
But
the
boss
shook
his
head
when
he
saw
him
--
no
,
*NL*
his
place
had
been
filled
long
ago
,
and
there
was
no
room
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
there
will
be
?
''
Jurgis
asked
.
``
I
may
have
to
wait
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
the
other
,
``
it
will
not
be
worth
your
while
to
wait
--
there
*NL*
will
be
nothing
for
you
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
stood
gazing
at
him
in
perplexity
.
``
What
is
the
matter
?
''
he
*NL*
asked
.
``
Did
n't
I
do
my
work
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
met
his
look
with
one
of
cold
indifference
,
and
answered
,
*NL*
``
There
will
be
nothing
for
you
here
,
I
said
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
had
his
suspicions
as
to
the
dreadful
meaning
of
that
incident
,
*NL*
and
he
went
away
with
a
sinking
at
the
heart
.
He
went
and
took
his
stand
*NL*
with
the
mob
of
hungry
wretches
who
were
standing
about
in
the
snow
*NL*
before
the
time
station
.
Here
he
stayed
,
breakfastless
,
for
two
hours
,
*NL*
until
the
throng
was
driven
away
by
the
clubs
of
the
police
.
There
was
*NL*
no
work
for
him
that
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
had
made
a
good
many
acquaintances
in
his
long
services
at
the
*NL*
yards
--
there
were
saloon-keepers
who
would
trust
him
for
a
drink
and
a
*NL*
sandwich
,
and
members
of
his
old
union
who
would
lend
him
a
dime
at
a
*NL*
pinch
.
It
was
not
a
question
of
life
and
death
for
him
,
therefore
;
he
*NL*
might
hunt
all
day
,
and
come
again
on
the
morrow
,
and
try
hanging
on
*NL*
thus
for
weeks
,
like
hundreds
and
thousands
of
others
.
Meantime
,
Teta
*NL*
Elzbieta
would
go
and
beg
,
over
in
the
Hyde
Park
district
,
and
the
*NL*
children
would
bring
home
enough
to
pacify
Aniele
,
and
keep
them
all
*NL*
alive
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
at
the
end
of
a
week
of
this
sort
of
waiting
,
roaming
about
in
*NL*
the
bitter
winds
or
loafing
in
saloons
,
that
Jurgis
stumbled
on
a
chance
*NL*
in
one
of
the
cellars
of
Jones
's
big
packing
plant
.
He
saw
a
foreman
*NL*
passing
the
open
doorway
,
and
hailed
him
for
a
job
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Push
a
truck
?
''
inquired
the
man
,
and
Jurgis
answered
,
``
Yes
,
sir
!
''
*NL*
before
the
words
were
well
out
of
his
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
your
name
?
''
demanded
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jurgis
Rudkus
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Worked
in
the
yards
before
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whereabouts
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Two
places
--
Brown
's
killing
beds
and
Durham
's
fertilizer
mill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
you
leave
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
first
time
I
had
an
accident
,
and
the
last
time
I
was
sent
up
for
a
*NL*
month
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
.
Well
,
I
'll
give
you
a
trial
.
Come
early
tomorrow
and
ask
for
Mr.
*NL*
Thomas
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
Jurgis
rushed
home
with
the
wild
tidings
that
he
had
a
job
--
that
*NL*
the
terrible
siege
was
over
.
The
remnants
of
the
family
had
quite
a
*NL*
celebration
that
night
;
and
in
the
morning
Jurgis
was
at
the
place
*NL*
half
an
hour
before
the
time
of
opening
.
The
foreman
came
in
shortly
*NL*
afterward
,
and
when
he
saw
Jurgis
he
frowned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
promised
you
a
job
,
did
n't
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
said
Jurgis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'm
sorry
,
but
I
made
a
mistake
.
I
ca
n't
use
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
stared
,
dumfounded
.
``
What
's
the
matter
?
''
he
gasped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
''
said
the
man
,
``
only
I
ca
n't
use
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
the
same
cold
,
hostile
stare
that
he
had
had
from
the
boss
of
*NL*
the
fertilizer
mill
.
He
knew
that
there
was
no
use
in
saying
a
word
,
and
*NL*
he
turned
and
went
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Out
in
the
saloons
the
men
could
tell
him
all
about
the
meaning
of
it
;
*NL*
they
gazed
at
him
with
pitying
eyes
--
poor
devil
,
he
was
blacklisted
!
*NL*
What
had
he
done
?
they
asked
--
knocked
down
his
boss
?
Good
heavens
,
then
*NL*
he
might
have
known
!
Why
,
he
stood
as
much
chance
of
getting
a
job
in
*NL*
Packingtown
as
of
being
chosen
mayor
of
Chicago
.
Why
had
he
wasted
his
*NL*
time
hunting
?
They
had
him
on
a
secret
list
in
every
office
,
big
and
*NL*
little
,
in
the
place
.
They
had
his
name
by
this
time
in
St.
Louis
and
*NL*
New
York
,
in
Omaha
and
Boston
,
in
Kansas
City
and
St.
Joseph
.
He
was
*NL*
condemned
and
sentenced
,
without
trial
and
without
appeal
;
he
could
*NL*
never
work
for
the
packers
again
--
he
could
not
even
clean
cattle
pens
or
*NL*
drive
a
truck
in
any
place
where
they
controlled
.
He
might
try
it
,
if
he
*NL*
chose
,
as
hundreds
had
tried
it
,
and
found
out
for
themselves
.
He
*NL*
would
never
be
told
anything
about
it
;
he
would
never
get
any
more
*NL*
satisfaction
than
he
had
gotten
just
now
;
but
he
would
always
find
when
*NL*
the
time
came
that
he
was
not
needed
.
It
would
not
do
for
him
to
give
*NL*
any
other
name
,
either
--
they
had
company
``
spotters
''
for
just
that
*NL*
purpose
,
and
he
would
n't
keep
a
job
in
Packingtown
three
days
.
It
was
*NL*
worth
a
fortune
to
the
packers
to
keep
their
blacklist
effective
,
as
*NL*
a
warning
to
the
men
and
a
means
of
keeping
down
union
agitation
and
*NL*
political
discontent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
went
home
,
carrying
these
new
tidings
to
the
family
council
.
It
*NL*
was
a
most
cruel
thing
;
here
in
this
district
was
his
home
,
such
as
it
*NL*
was
,
the
place
he
was
used
to
and
the
friends
he
knew
--
and
now
every
*NL*
possibility
of
employment
in
it
was
closed
to
him
.
There
was
nothing
in
*NL*
Packingtown
but
packing
houses
;
and
so
it
was
the
same
thing
as
evicting
*NL*
him
from
his
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
and
the
two
women
spent
all
day
and
half
the
night
discussing
it
.
It
*NL*
would
be
convenient
,
downtown
,
to
the
children
's
place
of
work
;
but
then
*NL*
Marija
was
on
the
road
to
recovery
,
and
had
hopes
of
getting
a
job
in
*NL*
the
yards
;
and
though
she
did
not
see
her
old-time
lover
once
a
month
,
*NL*
because
of
the
misery
of
their
state
,
yet
she
could
not
make
up
her
*NL*
mind
to
go
away
and
give
him
up
forever
.
Then
,
too
,
Elzbieta
had
heard
*NL*
something
about
a
chance
to
scrub
floors
in
Durham
's
offices
and
was
*NL*
waiting
every
day
for
word
.
In
the
end
it
was
decided
that
Jurgis
should
*NL*
go
downtown
to
strike
out
for
himself
,
and
they
would
decide
after
he
*NL*
got
a
job
.
As
there
was
no
one
from
whom
he
could
borrow
there
,
and
he
*NL*
dared
not
beg
for
fear
of
being
arrested
,
it
was
arranged
that
every
day
*NL*
he
should
meet
one
of
the
children
and
be
given
fifteen
cents
of
their
*NL*
earnings
,
upon
which
he
could
keep
going
.
Then
all
day
he
was
to
pace
*NL*
the
streets
with
hundreds
and
thousands
of
other
homeless
wretches
*NL*
inquiring
at
stores
,
warehouses
,
and
factories
for
a
chance
;
and
at
*NL*
night
he
was
to
crawl
into
some
doorway
or
underneath
a
truck
,
and
hide
*NL*
there
until
midnight
,
when
he
might
get
into
one
of
the
station
houses
,
*NL*
and
spread
a
newspaper
upon
the
floor
,
and
lie
down
in
the
midst
of
*NL*
a
throng
of
``
bums
''
and
beggars
,
reeking
with
alcohol
and
tobacco
,
and
*NL*
filthy
with
vermin
and
disease
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
So
for
two
weeks
more
Jurgis
fought
with
the
demon
of
despair
.
Once
he
*NL*
got
a
chance
to
load
a
truck
for
half
a
day
,
and
again
he
carried
an
old
*NL*
woman
's
valise
and
was
given
a
quarter
.
This
let
him
into
a
lodging-house
*NL*
on
several
nights
when
he
might
otherwise
have
frozen
to
death
;
and
it
*NL*
also
gave
him
a
chance
now
and
then
to
buy
a
newspaper
in
the
morning
*NL*
and
hunt
up
jobs
while
his
rivals
were
watching
and
waiting
for
a
*NL*
paper
to
be
thrown
away
.
This
,
however
,
was
really
not
the
advantage
it
*NL*
seemed
,
for
the
newspaper
advertisements
were
a
cause
of
much
loss
of
*NL*
precious
time
and
of
many
weary
journeys
.
A
full
half
of
these
were
*NL*
``
fakes
,
''
put
in
by
the
endless
variety
of
establishments
which
preyed
*NL*
upon
the
helpless
ignorance
of
the
unemployed
.
If
Jurgis
lost
only
*NL*
his
time
,
it
was
because
he
had
nothing
else
to
lose
;
whenever
a
*NL*
smooth-tongued
agent
would
tell
him
of
the
wonderful
positions
he
had
on
*NL*
hand
,
he
could
only
shake
his
head
sorrowfully
and
say
that
he
had
not
*NL*
the
necessary
dollar
to
deposit
;
when
it
was
explained
to
him
what
``
big
*NL*
money
''
he
and
all
his
family
could
make
by
coloring
photographs
,
he
*NL*
could
only
promise
to
come
in
again
when
he
had
two
dollars
to
invest
in
*NL*
the
outfit
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
end
Jurgis
got
a
chance
through
an
accidental
meeting
with
an
*NL*
old-time
acquaintance
of
his
union
days
.
He
met
this
man
on
his
way
to
*NL*
work
in
the
giant
factories
of
the
Harvester
Trust
;
and
his
friend
told
*NL*
him
to
come
along
and
he
would
speak
a
good
word
for
him
to
his
boss
,
*NL*
whom
he
knew
well
.
So
Jurgis
trudged
four
or
five
miles
,
and
passed
*NL*
through
a
waiting
throng
of
unemployed
at
the
gate
under
the
escort
*NL*
of
his
friend
.
His
knees
nearly
gave
way
beneath
him
when
the
foreman
,
*NL*
after
looking
him
over
and
questioning
him
,
told
him
that
he
could
find
*NL*
an
opening
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
much
this
accident
meant
to
Jurgis
he
realized
only
by
stages
;
*NL*
for
he
found
that
the
harvester
works
were
the
sort
of
place
to
which
*NL*
philanthropists
and
reformers
pointed
with
pride
.
It
had
some
thought
*NL*
for
its
employees
;
its
workshops
were
big
and
roomy
,
it
provided
a
*NL*
restaurant
where
the
workmen
could
buy
good
food
at
cost
,
it
had
even
*NL*
a
reading
room
,
and
decent
places
where
its
girl-hands
could
rest
;
also
*NL*
the
work
was
free
from
many
of
the
elements
of
filth
and
repulsiveness
*NL*
that
prevailed
at
the
stockyards
.
Day
after
day
Jurgis
discovered
these
*NL*
things
--
things
never
expected
nor
dreamed
of
by
him
--
until
this
new
*NL*
place
came
to
seem
a
kind
of
a
heaven
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
an
enormous
establishment
,
covering
a
hundred
and
sixty
acres
*NL*
of
ground
,
employing
five
thousand
people
,
and
turning
out
over
three
*NL*
hundred
thousand
machines
every
year
--
a
good
part
of
all
the
harvesting
*NL*
and
mowing
machines
used
in
the
country
.
Jurgis
saw
very
little
of
it
,
*NL*
of
course
--
it
was
all
specialized
work
,
the
same
as
at
the
stockyards
;
*NL*
each
one
of
the
hundreds
of
parts
of
a
mowing
machine
was
made
*NL*
separately
,
and
sometimes
handled
by
hundreds
of
men
.
Where
Jurgis
*NL*
worked
there
was
a
machine
which
cut
and
stamped
a
certain
piece
of
*NL*
steel
about
two
square
inches
in
size
;
the
pieces
came
tumbling
out
upon
*NL*
a
tray
,
and
all
that
human
hands
had
to
do
was
to
pile
them
in
regular
*NL*
rows
,
and
change
the
trays
at
intervals
.
This
was
done
by
a
single
boy
,
*NL*
who
stood
with
eyes
and
thought
centered
upon
it
,
and
fingers
flying
so
*NL*
fast
that
the
sounds
of
the
bits
of
steel
striking
upon
each
other
was
*NL*
like
the
music
of
an
express
train
as
one
hears
it
in
a
sleeping
car
at
*NL*
night
.
This
was
``
piece-work
,
''
of
course
;
and
besides
it
was
made
certain
*NL*
that
the
boy
did
not
idle
,
by
setting
the
machine
to
match
the
highest
*NL*
possible
speed
of
human
hands
.
Thirty
thousand
of
these
pieces
he
*NL*
handled
every
day
,
nine
or
ten
million
every
year
--
how
many
in
a
*NL*
lifetime
it
rested
with
the
gods
to
say
.
Near
by
him
men
sat
bending
*NL*
over
whirling
grindstones
,
putting
the
finishing
touches
to
the
steel
*NL*
knives
of
the
reaper
;
picking
them
out
of
a
basket
with
the
right
hand
,
*NL*
pressing
first
one
side
and
then
the
other
against
the
stone
and
finally
*NL*
dropping
them
with
the
left
hand
into
another
basket
.
One
of
these
men
*NL*
told
Jurgis
that
he
had
sharpened
three
thousand
pieces
of
steel
a
day
*NL*
for
thirteen
years
.
In
the
next
room
were
wonderful
machines
that
ate
*NL*
up
long
steel
rods
by
slow
stages
,
cutting
them
off
,
seizing
the
pieces
,
*NL*
stamping
heads
upon
them
,
grinding
them
and
polishing
them
,
threading
*NL*
them
,
and
finally
dropping
them
into
a
basket
,
all
ready
to
bolt
the
*NL*
harvesters
together
.
From
yet
another
machine
came
tens
of
thousands
of
*NL*
steel
burs
to
fit
upon
these
bolts
.
In
other
places
all
these
various
*NL*
parts
were
dipped
into
troughs
of
paint
and
hung
up
to
dry
,
and
then
*NL*
slid
along
on
trolleys
to
a
room
where
men
streaked
them
with
red
and
*NL*
yellow
,
so
that
they
might
look
cheerful
in
the
harvest
fields
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
's
friend
worked
upstairs
in
the
casting
rooms
,
and
his
task
was
*NL*
to
make
the
molds
of
a
certain
part
.
He
shoveled
black
sand
into
an
*NL*
iron
receptacle
and
pounded
it
tight
and
set
it
aside
to
harden
;
then
it
*NL*
would
be
taken
out
,
and
molten
iron
poured
into
it
.
This
man
,
too
,
was
*NL*
paid
by
the
mold
--
or
rather
for
perfect
castings
,
nearly
half
his
*NL*
work
going
for
naught
.
You
might
see
him
,
along
with
dozens
of
others
,
*NL*
toiling
like
one
possessed
by
a
whole
community
of
demons
;
his
arms
*NL*
working
like
the
driving
rods
of
an
engine
,
his
long
,
black
hair
flying
*NL*
wild
,
his
eyes
starting
out
,
the
sweat
rolling
in
rivers
down
his
face
.
*NL*
When
he
had
shoveled
the
mold
full
of
sand
,
and
reached
for
the
pounder
*NL*
to
pound
it
with
,
it
was
after
the
manner
of
a
canoeist
running
rapids
*NL*
and
seizing
a
pole
at
sight
of
a
submerged
rock
.
All
day
long
this
man
*NL*
would
toil
thus
,
his
whole
being
centered
upon
the
purpose
of
making
*NL*
twenty-three
instead
of
twenty-two
and
a
half
cents
an
hour
;
and
then
*NL*
his
product
would
be
reckoned
up
by
the
census
taker
,
and
jubilant
*NL*
captains
of
industry
would
boast
of
it
in
their
banquet
halls
,
telling
*NL*
how
our
workers
are
nearly
twice
as
efficient
as
those
of
any
other
*NL*
country
.
If
we
are
the
greatest
nation
the
sun
ever
shone
upon
,
it
would
*NL*
seem
to
be
mainly
because
we
have
been
able
to
goad
our
wage-earners
to
*NL*
this
pitch
of
frenzy
;
though
there
are
a
few
other
things
that
are
great
*NL*
among
us
including
our
drink-bill
,
which
is
a
billion
and
a
quarter
of
*NL*
dollars
a
year
,
and
doubling
itself
every
decade
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
machine
which
stamped
out
the
iron
plates
,
and
then
another
*NL*
which
,
with
a
mighty
thud
,
mashed
them
to
the
shape
of
the
sitting-down
*NL*
portion
of
the
American
farmer
.
Then
they
were
piled
upon
a
truck
,
and
*NL*
it
was
Jurgis
's
task
to
wheel
them
to
the
room
where
the
machines
were
*NL*
``
assembled
.
''
This
was
child
's
play
for
him
,
and
he
got
a
dollar
*NL*
and
seventy-five
cents
a
day
for
it
;
on
Saturday
he
paid
Aniele
the
*NL*
seventy-five
cents
a
week
he
owed
her
for
the
use
of
her
garret
,
and
*NL*
also
redeemed
his
overcoat
,
which
Elzbieta
had
put
in
pawn
when
he
was
*NL*
in
jail
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
last
was
a
great
blessing
.
A
man
can
not
go
about
in
midwinter
in
*NL*
Chicago
with
no
overcoat
and
not
pay
for
it
,
and
Jurgis
had
to
walk
or
*NL*
ride
five
or
six
miles
back
and
forth
to
his
work
.
It
so
happened
that
*NL*
half
of
this
was
in
one
direction
and
half
in
another
,
necessitating
*NL*
a
change
of
cars
;
the
law
required
that
transfers
be
given
at
all
*NL*
intersecting
points
,
but
the
railway
corporation
had
gotten
round
this
*NL*
by
arranging
a
pretense
at
separate
ownership
.
So
whenever
he
wished
*NL*
to
ride
,
he
had
to
pay
ten
cents
each
way
,
or
over
ten
per
cent
of
his
*NL*
income
to
this
power
,
which
had
gotten
its
franchises
long
ago
by
buying
*NL*
up
the
city
council
,
in
the
face
of
popular
clamor
amounting
almost
to
a
*NL*
rebellion
.
Tired
as
he
felt
at
night
,
and
dark
and
bitter
cold
as
it
*NL*
was
in
the
morning
,
Jurgis
generally
chose
to
walk
;
at
the
hours
other
*NL*
workmen
were
traveling
,
the
streetcar
monopoly
saw
fit
to
put
on
so
few
*NL*
cars
that
there
would
be
men
hanging
to
every
foot
of
the
backs
of
them
*NL*
and
often
crouching
upon
the
snow-covered
roof
.
Of
course
the
doors
*NL*
could
never
be
closed
,
and
so
the
cars
were
as
cold
as
outdoors
;
Jurgis
,
*NL*
like
many
others
,
found
it
better
to
spend
his
fare
for
a
drink
and
a
*NL*
free
lunch
,
to
give
him
strength
to
walk
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
,
however
,
were
all
slight
matters
to
a
man
who
had
escaped
from
*NL*
Durham
's
fertilizer
mill
.
Jurgis
began
to
pick
up
heart
again
and
to
*NL*
make
plans
.
He
had
lost
his
house
but
then
the
awful
load
of
the
rent
*NL*
and
interest
was
off
his
shoulders
,
and
when
Marija
was
well
again
they
*NL*
could
start
over
and
save
.
In
the
shop
where
he
worked
was
a
man
,
a
*NL*
Lithuanian
like
himself
,
whom
the
others
spoke
of
in
admiring
whispers
,
*NL*
because
of
the
mighty
feats
he
was
performing
.
All
day
he
sat
at
a
*NL*
machine
turning
bolts
;
and
then
in
the
evening
he
went
to
the
public
*NL*
school
to
study
English
and
learn
to
read
.
In
addition
,
because
he
had
a
*NL*
family
of
eight
children
to
support
and
his
earnings
were
not
enough
,
on
*NL*
Saturdays
and
Sundays
he
served
as
a
watchman
;
he
was
required
to
press
*NL*
two
buttons
at
opposite
ends
of
a
building
every
five
minutes
,
and
*NL*
as
the
walk
only
took
him
two
minutes
,
he
had
three
minutes
to
study
*NL*
between
each
trip
.
Jurgis
felt
jealous
of
this
fellow
;
for
that
was
*NL*
the
sort
of
thing
he
himself
had
dreamed
of
,
two
or
three
years
ago
.
*NL*
He
might
do
it
even
yet
,
if
he
had
a
fair
chance
--
he
might
attract
*NL*
attention
and
become
a
skilled
man
or
a
boss
,
as
some
had
done
in
this
*NL*
place
.
Suppose
that
Marija
could
get
a
job
in
the
big
mill
where
they
*NL*
made
binder
twine
--
then
they
would
move
into
this
neighborhood
,
and
he
*NL*
would
really
have
a
chance
.
With
a
hope
like
that
,
there
was
some
use
*NL*
in
living
;
to
find
a
place
where
you
were
treated
like
a
human
being
--
by
*NL*
God
!
he
would
show
them
how
he
could
appreciate
it
.
He
laughed
to
*NL*
himself
as
he
thought
how
he
would
hang
on
to
this
job
!
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
one
afternoon
,
the
ninth
of
his
work
in
the
place
,
when
he
went
*NL*
to
get
his
overcoat
he
saw
a
group
of
men
crowded
before
a
placard
on
*NL*
the
door
,
and
when
he
went
over
and
asked
what
it
was
,
they
told
him
*NL*
that
beginning
with
the
morrow
his
department
of
the
harvester
works
*NL*
would
be
closed
until
further
notice
!
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
21
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
the
way
they
did
it
!
There
was
not
half
an
hour
's
warning
--
the
*NL*
works
were
closed
!
It
had
happened
that
way
before
,
said
the
men
,
and
it
*NL*
would
happen
that
way
forever
.
They
had
made
all
the
harvesting
machines
*NL*
that
the
world
needed
,
and
now
they
had
to
wait
till
some
wore
out
!
It
*NL*
was
nobody
's
fault
--
that
was
the
way
of
it
;
and
thousands
of
men
and
*NL*
women
were
turned
out
in
the
dead
of
winter
,
to
live
upon
their
savings
*NL*
if
they
had
any
,
and
otherwise
to
die
.
So
many
tens
of
thousands
already
*NL*
in
the
city
,
homeless
and
begging
for
work
,
and
now
several
thousand
*NL*
more
added
to
them
!
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
walked
home-with
his
pittance
of
pay
in
his
pocket
,
heartbroken
,
*NL*
overwhelmed
.
One
more
bandage
had
been
torn
from
his
eyes
,
one
more
*NL*
pitfall
was
revealed
to
him
!
Of
what
help
was
kindness
and
decency
on
*NL*
the
part
of
employers
--
when
they
could
not
keep
a
job
for
him
,
when
*NL*
there
were
more
harvesting
machines
made
than
the
world
was
able
to
buy
!
*NL*
What
a
hellish
mockery
it
was
,
anyway
,
that
a
man
should
slave
to
make
*NL*
harvesting
machines
for
the
country
,
only
to
be
turned
out
to
starve
for
*NL*
doing
his
duty
too
well
!
*NL*
*NL*
It
took
him
two
days
to
get
over
this
heart-sickening
disappointment
.
He
*NL*
did
not
drink
anything
,
because
Elzbieta
got
his
money
for
safekeeping
,
*NL*
and
knew
him
too
well
to
be
in
the
least
frightened
by
his
angry
*NL*
demands
.
He
stayed
up
in
the
garret
however
,
and
sulked
--
what
was
the
*NL*
use
of
a
man
's
hunting
a
job
when
it
was
taken
from
him
before
he
had
*NL*
time
to
learn
the
work
?
But
then
their
money
was
going
again
,
and
little
*NL*
Antanas
was
hungry
,
and
crying
with
the
bitter
cold
of
the
garret
.
Also
*NL*
Madame
Haupt
,
the
midwife
,
was
after
him
for
some
money
.
So
he
went
out
*NL*
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
another
ten
days
he
roamed
the
streets
and
alleys
of
the
huge
city
,
*NL*
sick
and
hungry
,
begging
for
any
work
.
He
tried
in
stores
and
offices
,
*NL*
in
restaurants
and
hotels
,
along
the
docks
and
in
the
railroad
yards
,
in
*NL*
warehouses
and
mills
and
factories
where
they
made
products
that
went
*NL*
to
every
corner
of
the
world
.
There
were
often
one
or
two
chances
--
but
*NL*
there
were
always
a
hundred
men
for
every
chance
,
and
his
turn
would
not
*NL*
come
.
At
night
he
crept
into
sheds
and
cellars
and
doorways
--
until
there
*NL*
came
a
spell
of
belated
winter
weather
,
with
a
raging
gale
,
and
the
*NL*
thermometer
five
degrees
below
zero
at
sundown
and
falling
all
night
.
*NL*
Then
Jurgis
fought
like
a
wild
beast
to
get
into
the
big
Harrison
Street
*NL*
police
station
,
and
slept
down
in
a
corridor
,
crowded
with
two
other
men
*NL*
upon
a
single
step
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
to
fight
often
in
these
days
to
fight
for
a
place
near
the
*NL*
factory
gates
,
and
now
and
again
with
gangs
on
the
street
.
He
found
,
for
*NL*
instance
,
that
the
business
of
carrying
satchels
for
railroad
passengers
*NL*
was
a
pre-empted
one
--
whenever
he
essayed
it
,
eight
or
ten
men
and
boys
*NL*
would
fall
upon
him
and
force
him
to
run
for
his
life
.
They
always
*NL*
had
the
policeman
``
squared
,
''
and
so
there
was
no
use
in
expecting
*NL*
protection
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
Jurgis
did
not
starve
to
death
was
due
solely
to
the
pittance
the
*NL*
children
brought
him
.
And
even
this
was
never
certain
.
For
one
thing
the
*NL*
cold
was
almost
more
than
the
children
could
bear
;
and
then
they
,
too
,
*NL*
were
in
perpetual
peril
from
rivals
who
plundered
and
beat
them
.
The
law
*NL*
was
against
them
,
too
--
little
Vilimas
,
who
was
really
eleven
,
but
did
*NL*
not
look
to
be
eight
,
was
stopped
on
the
streets
by
a
severe
old
lady
in
*NL*
spectacles
,
who
told
him
that
he
was
too
young
to
be
working
and
that
*NL*
if
he
did
not
stop
selling
papers
she
would
send
a
truant
officer
after
*NL*
him
.
Also
one
night
a
strange
man
caught
little
Kotrina
by
the
arm
and
*NL*
tried
to
persuade
her
into
a
dark
cellar-way
,
an
experience
which
filled
*NL*
her
with
such
terror
that
she
was
hardly
to
be
kept
at
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
on
a
Sunday
,
as
there
was
no
use
looking
for
work
,
Jurgis
went
*NL*
home
by
stealing
rides
on
the
cars
.
He
found
that
they
had
been
waiting
*NL*
for
him
for
three
days
--
there
was
a
chance
of
a
job
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
quite
a
story
.
Little
Juozapas
,
who
was
near
crazy
with
hunger
*NL*
these
days
,
had
gone
out
on
the
street
to
beg
for
himself
.
Juozapas
had
*NL*
only
one
leg
,
having
been
run
over
by
a
wagon
when
a
little
child
,
*NL*
but
he
had
got
himself
a
broomstick
,
which
he
put
under
his
arm
for
a
*NL*
crutch
.
He
had
fallen
in
with
some
other
children
and
found
the
way
to
*NL*
Mike
Scully
's
dump
,
which
lay
three
or
four
blocks
away
.
To
this
place
*NL*
there
came
every
day
many
hundreds
of
wagon-loads
of
garbage
and
trash
*NL*
from
the
lake
front
,
where
the
rich
people
lived
;
and
in
the
heaps
the
*NL*
children
raked
for
food
--
there
were
hunks
of
bread
and
potato
peelings
*NL*
and
apple
cores
and
meat
bones
,
all
of
it
half
frozen
and
quite
*NL*
unspoiled
.
Little
Juozapas
gorged
himself
,
and
came
home
with
a
*NL*
newspaper
full
,
which
he
was
feeding
to
Antanas
when
his
mother
came
in
.
*NL*
Elzbieta
was
horrified
,
for
she
did
not
believe
that
the
food
out
of
the
*NL*
dumps
was
fit
to
eat
.
The
next
day
,
however
,
when
no
harm
came
of
it
and
*NL*
Juozapas
began
to
cry
with
hunger
,
she
gave
in
and
said
that
he
might
go
*NL*
again
.
And
that
afternoon
he
came
home
with
a
story
of
how
while
he
had
*NL*
been
digging
away
with
a
stick
,
a
lady
upon
the
street
had
called
him
.
*NL*
A
real
fine
lady
,
the
little
boy
explained
,
a
beautiful
lady
;
and
*NL*
she
wanted
to
know
all
about
him
,
and
whether
he
got
the
garbage
for
*NL*
chickens
,
and
why
he
walked
with
a
broomstick
,
and
why
Ona
had
died
,
and
*NL*
how
Jurgis
had
come
to
go
to
jail
,
and
what
was
the
matter
with
Marija
,
*NL*
and
everything
.
In
the
end
she
had
asked
where
he
lived
,
and
said
that
*NL*
she
was
coming
to
see
him
,
and
bring
him
a
new
crutch
to
walk
with
.
She
*NL*
had
on
a
hat
with
a
bird
upon
it
,
Juozapas
added
,
and
a
long
fur
snake
*NL*
around
her
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
really
came
,
the
very
next
morning
,
and
climbed
the
ladder
to
the
*NL*
garret
,
and
stood
and
stared
about
her
,
turning
pale
at
the
sight
of
*NL*
the
blood
stains
on
the
floor
where
Ona
had
died
.
She
was
a
``
settlement
*NL*
worker
,
''
she
explained
to
Elzbieta
--
she
lived
around
on
Ashland
Avenue
.
*NL*
Elzbieta
knew
the
place
,
over
a
feed
store
;
somebody
had
wanted
her
to
*NL*
go
there
,
but
she
had
not
cared
to
,
for
she
thought
that
it
must
have
*NL*
something
to
do
with
religion
,
and
the
priest
did
not
like
her
to
have
*NL*
anything
to
do
with
strange
religions
.
They
were
rich
people
who
came
*NL*
to
live
there
to
find
out
about
the
poor
people
;
but
what
good
they
*NL*
expected
it
would
do
them
to
know
,
one
could
not
imagine
.
So
spoke
*NL*
Elzbieta
,
naively
,
and
the
young
lady
laughed
and
was
rather
at
a
loss
*NL*
for
an
answer
--
she
stood
and
gazed
about
her
,
and
thought
of
a
cynical
*NL*
remark
that
had
been
made
to
her
,
that
she
was
standing
upon
the
brink
*NL*
of
the
pit
of
hell
and
throwing
in
snowballs
to
lower
the
temperature
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elzbieta
was
glad
to
have
somebody
to
listen
,
and
she
told
all
their
*NL*
woes
--
what
had
happened
to
Ona
,
and
the
jail
,
and
the
loss
of
their
*NL*
home
,
and
Marija
's
accident
,
and
how
Ona
had
died
,
and
how
Jurgis
could
*NL*
get
no
work
.
As
she
listened
the
pretty
young
lady
's
eyes
filled
with
*NL*
tears
,
and
in
the
midst
of
it
she
burst
into
weeping
and
hid
her
face
on
*NL*
Elzbieta
's
shoulder
,
quite
regardless
of
the
fact
that
the
woman
had
on
*NL*
a
dirty
old
wrapper
and
that
the
garret
was
full
of
fleas
.
Poor
Elzbieta
*NL*
was
ashamed
of
herself
for
having
told
so
woeful
a
tale
,
and
the
other
*NL*
had
to
beg
and
plead
with
her
to
get
her
to
go
on
.
The
end
of
it
was
*NL*
that
the
young
lady
sent
them
a
basket
of
things
to
eat
,
and
left
a
*NL*
letter
that
Jurgis
was
to
take
to
a
gentleman
who
was
superintendent
in
*NL*
one
of
the
mills
of
the
great
steelworks
in
South
Chicago
.
``
He
will
get
*NL*
Jurgis
something
to
do
,
''
the
young
lady
had
said
,
and
added
,
smiling
*NL*
through
her
tears
--
``
If
he
does
n't
,
he
will
never
marry
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
steel-works
were
fifteen
miles
away
,
and
as
usual
it
was
so
*NL*
contrived
that
one
had
to
pay
two
fares
to
get
there
.
Far
and
wide
the
*NL*
sky
was
flaring
with
the
red
glare
that
leaped
from
rows
of
towering
*NL*
chimneys
--
for
it
was
pitch
dark
when
Jurgis
arrived
.
The
vast
works
,
a
*NL*
city
in
themselves
,
were
surrounded
by
a
stockade
;
and
already
a
full
*NL*
hundred
men
were
waiting
at
the
gate
where
new
hands
were
taken
on
.
Soon
*NL*
after
daybreak
whistles
began
to
blow
,
and
then
suddenly
thousands
of
*NL*
men
appeared
,
streaming
from
saloons
and
boardinghouses
across
the
way
,
*NL*
leaping
from
trolley
cars
that
passed
--
it
seemed
as
if
they
rose
out
of
*NL*
the
ground
,
in
the
dim
gray
light
.
A
river
of
them
poured
in
through
the
*NL*
gate
--
and
then
gradually
ebbed
away
again
,
until
there
were
only
a
few
*NL*
late
ones
running
,
and
the
watchman
pacing
up
and
down
,
and
the
hungry
*NL*
strangers
stamping
and
shivering
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
presented
his
precious
letter
.
The
gatekeeper
was
surly
,
and
put
*NL*
him
through
a
catechism
,
but
he
insisted
that
he
knew
nothing
,
and
as
he
*NL*
had
taken
the
precaution
to
seal
his
letter
,
there
was
nothing
for
the
*NL*
gatekeeper
to
do
but
send
it
to
the
person
to
whom
it
was
addressed
.
*NL*
A
messenger
came
back
to
say
that
Jurgis
should
wait
,
and
so
he
came
*NL*
inside
of
the
gate
,
perhaps
not
sorry
enough
that
there
were
others
less
*NL*
fortunate
watching
him
with
greedy
eyes
.
The
great
mills
were
getting
*NL*
under
way
--
one
could
hear
a
vast
stirring
,
a
rolling
and
rumbling
*NL*
and
hammering
.
Little
by
little
the
scene
grew
plain
:
towering
,
black
*NL*
buildings
here
and
there
,
long
rows
of
shops
and
sheds
,
little
railways
*NL*
branching
everywhere
,
bare
gray
cinders
underfoot
and
oceans
of
*NL*
billowing
black
smoke
above
.
On
one
side
of
the
grounds
ran
a
railroad
*NL*
with
a
dozen
tracks
,
and
on
the
other
side
lay
the
lake
,
where
steamers
*NL*
came
to
load
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
had
time
enough
to
stare
and
speculate
,
for
it
was
two
hours
*NL*
before
he
was
summoned
.
He
went
into
the
office
building
,
where
a
*NL*
company
timekeeper
interviewed
him
.
The
superintendent
was
busy
,
he
*NL*
said
,
but
he
-LRB-
the
timekeeper
-RRB-
would
try
to
find
Jurgis
a
job
.
He
had
*NL*
never
worked
in
a
steel
mill
before
?
But
he
was
ready
for
anything
?
*NL*
Well
,
then
,
they
would
go
and
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
they
began
a
tour
,
among
sights
that
made
Jurgis
stare
amazed
.
He
*NL*
wondered
if
ever
he
could
get
used
to
working
in
a
place
like
this
,
*NL*
where
the
air
shook
with
deafening
thunder
,
and
whistles
shrieked
*NL*
warnings
on
all
sides
of
him
at
once
;
where
miniature
steam
engines
came
*NL*
rushing
upon
him
,
and
sizzling
,
quivering
,
white-hot
masses
of
metal
*NL*
sped
past
him
,
and
explosions
of
fire
and
flaming
sparks
dazzled
him
and
*NL*
scorched
his
face
.
The
men
in
these
mills
were
all
black
with
soot
,
and
*NL*
hollow-eyed
and
gaunt
;
they
worked
with
fierce
intensity
,
rushing
here
*NL*
and
there
,
and
never
lifting
their
eyes
from
their
tasks
.
Jurgis
clung
*NL*
to
his
guide
like
a
scared
child
to
its
nurse
,
and
while
the
latter
*NL*
hailed
one
foreman
after
another
to
ask
if
they
could
use
another
*NL*
unskilled
man
,
he
stared
about
him
and
marveled
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
taken
to
the
Bessemer
furnace
,
where
they
made
billets
of
*NL*
steel
--
a
dome-like
building
,
the
size
of
a
big
theater
.
Jurgis
stood
*NL*
where
the
balcony
of
the
theater
would
have
been
,
and
opposite
,
by
the
*NL*
stage
,
he
saw
three
giant
caldrons
,
big
enough
for
all
the
devils
of
*NL*
hell
to
brew
their
broth
in
,
full
of
something
white
and
blinding
,
*NL*
bubbling
and
splashing
,
roaring
as
if
volcanoes
were
blowing
through
*NL*
it
--
one
had
to
shout
to
be
heard
in
the
place
.
Liquid
fire
would
leap
*NL*
from
these
caldrons
and
scatter
like
bombs
below
--
and
men
were
working
*NL*
there
,
seeming
careless
,
so
that
Jurgis
caught
his
breath
with
fright
.
*NL*
Then
a
whistle
would
toot
,
and
across
the
curtain
of
the
theater
would
*NL*
come
a
little
engine
with
a
carload
of
something
to
be
dumped
into
one
*NL*
of
the
receptacles
;
and
then
another
whistle
would
toot
,
down
by
*NL*
the
stage
,
and
another
train
would
back
up
--
and
suddenly
,
without
an
*NL*
instant
's
warning
,
one
of
the
giant
kettles
began
to
tilt
and
topple
,
*NL*
flinging
out
a
jet
of
hissing
,
roaring
flame
.
Jurgis
shrank
back
*NL*
appalled
,
for
he
thought
it
was
an
accident
;
there
fell
a
pillar
of
*NL*
white
flame
,
dazzling
as
the
sun
,
swishing
like
a
huge
tree
falling
in
*NL*
the
forest
.
A
torrent
of
sparks
swept
all
the
way
across
the
building
,
*NL*
overwhelming
everything
,
hiding
it
from
sight
;
and
then
Jurgis
looked
*NL*
through
the
fingers
of
his
hands
,
and
saw
pouring
out
of
the
caldron
a
*NL*
cascade
of
living
,
leaping
fire
,
white
with
a
whiteness
not
of
earth
,
*NL*
scorching
the
eyeballs
.
Incandescent
rainbows
shone
above
it
,
blue
,
*NL*
red
,
and
golden
lights
played
about
it
;
but
the
stream
itself
was
white
,
*NL*
ineffable
.
Out
of
regions
of
wonder
it
streamed
,
the
very
river
of
life
;
*NL*
and
the
soul
leaped
up
at
the
sight
of
it
,
fled
back
upon
it
,
swift
and
*NL*
resistless
,
back
into
far-off
lands
,
where
beauty
and
terror
dwell
.
Then
*NL*
the
great
caldron
tilted
back
again
,
empty
,
and
Jurgis
saw
to
his
relief
*NL*
that
no
one
was
hurt
,
and
turned
and
followed
his
guide
out
into
the
*NL*
sunlight
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
through
the
blast
furnaces
,
through
rolling
mills
where
bars
*NL*
of
steel
were
tossed
about
and
chopped
like
bits
of
cheese
.
All
around
*NL*
and
above
giant
machine
arms
were
flying
,
giant
wheels
were
turning
,
*NL*
great
hammers
crashing
;
traveling
cranes
creaked
and
groaned
overhead
,
*NL*
reaching
down
iron
hands
and
seizing
iron
prey
--
it
was
like
standing
in
*NL*
the
center
of
the
earth
,
where
the
machinery
of
time
was
revolving
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
and
by
they
came
to
the
place
where
steel
rails
were
made
;
and
Jurgis
*NL*
heard
a
toot
behind
him
,
and
jumped
out
of
the
way
of
a
car
with
a
*NL*
white-hot
ingot
upon
it
,
the
size
of
a
man
's
body
.
There
was
a
sudden
*NL*
crash
and
the
car
came
to
a
halt
,
and
the
ingot
toppled
out
upon
*NL*
a
moving
platform
,
where
steel
fingers
and
arms
seized
hold
of
it
,
*NL*
punching
it
and
prodding
it
into
place
,
and
hurrying
it
into
the
grip
of
*NL*
huge
rollers
.
Then
it
came
out
upon
the
other
side
,
and
there
were
more
*NL*
crashings
and
clatterings
,
and
over
it
was
flopped
,
like
a
pancake
on
*NL*
a
gridiron
,
and
seized
again
and
rushed
back
at
you
through
another
*NL*
squeezer
.
So
amid
deafening
uproar
it
clattered
to
and
fro
,
growing
*NL*
thinner
and
flatter
and
longer
.
The
ingot
seemed
almost
a
living
thing
;
*NL*
it
did
not
want
to
run
this
mad
course
,
but
it
was
in
the
grip
of
fate
,
*NL*
it
was
tumbled
on
,
screeching
and
clanking
and
shivering
in
protest
.
By
*NL*
and
by
it
was
long
and
thin
,
a
great
red
snake
escaped
from
purgatory
;
*NL*
and
then
,
as
it
slid
through
the
rollers
,
you
would
have
sworn
that
it
*NL*
was
alive
--
it
writhed
and
squirmed
,
and
wriggles
and
shudders
passed
out
*NL*
through
its
tail
,
all
but
flinging
it
off
by
their
violence
.
There
was
*NL*
no
rest
for
it
until
it
was
cold
and
black
--
and
then
it
needed
only
to
*NL*
be
cut
and
straightened
to
be
ready
for
a
railroad
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
at
the
end
of
this
rail
's
progress
that
Jurgis
got
his
chance
.
*NL*
They
had
to
be
moved
by
men
with
crowbars
,
and
the
boss
here
could
use
*NL*
another
man
.
So
he
took
off
his
coat
and
set
to
work
on
the
spot
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
took
him
two
hours
to
get
to
this
place
every
day
and
cost
him
a
*NL*
dollar
and
twenty
cents
a
week
.
As
this
was
out
of
the
question
,
he
*NL*
wrapped
his
bedding
in
a
bundle
and
took
it
with
him
,
and
one
of
his
*NL*
fellow
workingmen
introduced
him
to
a
Polish
lodging-house
,
where
he
*NL*
might
have
the
privilege
of
sleeping
upon
the
floor
for
ten
cents
a
*NL*
night
.
He
got
his
meals
at
free-lunch
counters
,
and
every
Saturday
night
*NL*
he
went
home
--
bedding
and
all
--
and
took
the
greater
part
of
his
money
to
*NL*
the
family
.
Elzbieta
was
sorry
for
this
arrangement
,
for
she
feared
that
*NL*
it
would
get
him
into
the
habit
of
living
without
them
,
and
once
a
week
*NL*
was
not
very
often
for
him
to
see
his
baby
;
but
there
was
no
other
way
*NL*
of
arranging
it
.
There
was
no
chance
for
a
woman
at
the
steelworks
,
and
*NL*
Marija
was
now
ready
for
work
again
,
and
lured
on
from
day
to
day
by
the
*NL*
hope
of
finding
it
at
the
yards
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
week
Jurgis
got
over
his
sense
of
helplessness
and
bewilderment
*NL*
in
the
rail
mill
.
He
learned
to
find
his
way
about
and
to
take
all
the
*NL*
miracles
and
terrors
for
granted
,
to
work
without
hearing
the
rumbling
*NL*
and
crashing
.
From
blind
fear
he
went
to
the
other
extreme
;
he
became
*NL*
reckless
and
indifferent
,
like
all
the
rest
of
the
men
,
who
took
*NL*
but
little
thought
of
themselves
in
the
ardor
of
their
work
.
It
was
*NL*
wonderful
,
when
one
came
to
think
of
it
,
that
these
men
should
have
*NL*
taken
an
interest
in
the
work
they
did
--
they
had
no
share
in
it
--
they
*NL*
were
paid
by
the
hour
,
and
paid
no
more
for
being
interested
.
Also
they
*NL*
knew
that
if
they
were
hurt
they
would
be
flung
aside
and
forgotten
--
and
*NL*
still
they
would
hurry
to
their
task
by
dangerous
short
cuts
,
would
use
*NL*
methods
that
were
quicker
and
more
effective
in
spite
of
the
fact
*NL*
that
they
were
also
risky
.
His
fourth
day
at
his
work
Jurgis
saw
a
man
*NL*
stumble
while
running
in
front
of
a
car
,
and
have
his
foot
mashed
off
,
*NL*
and
before
he
had
been
there
three
weeks
he
was
witness
of
a
yet
more
*NL*
dreadful
accident
.
There
was
a
row
of
brick
furnaces
,
shining
white
*NL*
through
every
crack
with
the
molten
steel
inside
.
Some
of
these
were
*NL*
bulging
dangerously
,
yet
men
worked
before
them
,
wearing
blue
glasses
*NL*
when
they
opened
and
shut
the
doors
.
One
morning
as
Jurgis
was
passing
,
*NL*
a
furnace
blew
out
,
spraying
two
men
with
a
shower
of
liquid
fire
.
As
*NL*
they
lay
screaming
and
rolling
upon
the
ground
in
agony
,
Jurgis
rushed
*NL*
to
help
them
,
and
as
a
result
he
lost
a
good
part
of
the
skin
from
the
*NL*
inside
of
one
of
his
hands
.
The
company
doctor
bandaged
it
up
,
but
he
*NL*
got
no
other
thanks
from
any
one
,
and
was
laid
up
for
eight
working
days
*NL*
without
any
pay
.
*NL*
*NL*
Most
fortunately
,
at
this
juncture
,
Elzbieta
got
the
long-awaited
chance
*NL*
to
go
at
five
o'clock
in
the
morning
and
help
scrub
the
office
floors
of
*NL*
one
of
the
packers
.
Jurgis
came
home
and
covered
himself
with
blankets
*NL*
to
keep
warm
,
and
divided
his
time
between
sleeping
and
playing
with
*NL*
little
Antanas
.
Juozapas
was
away
raking
in
the
dump
a
good
part
of
the
*NL*
time
,
and
Elzbieta
and
Marija
were
hunting
for
more
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
Antanas
was
now
over
a
year
and
a
half
old
,
and
was
a
perfect
talking
*NL*
machine
.
He
learned
so
fast
that
every
week
when
Jurgis
came
home
it
*NL*
seemed
to
him
as
if
he
had
a
new
child
.
He
would
sit
down
and
listen
and
*NL*
stare
at
him
,
and
give
vent
to
delighted
exclamations
--
``
Palauk
!
Muma
!
*NL*
Tu
mano
szirdele
!
''
The
little
fellow
was
now
really
the
one
delight
*NL*
that
Jurgis
had
in
the
world
--
his
one
hope
,
his
one
victory
.
Thank
God
,
*NL*
Antanas
was
a
boy
!
And
he
was
as
tough
as
a
pine
knot
,
and
with
the
*NL*
appetite
of
a
wolf
.
Nothing
had
hurt
him
,
and
nothing
could
hurt
him
;
*NL*
he
had
come
through
all
the
suffering
and
deprivation
unscathed
--
only
*NL*
shriller-voiced
and
more
determined
in
his
grip
upon
life
.
He
was
a
*NL*
terrible
child
to
manage
,
was
Antanas
,
but
his
father
did
not
mind
*NL*
that
--
he
would
watch
him
and
smile
to
himself
with
satisfaction
.
The
*NL*
more
of
a
fighter
he
was
the
better
--
he
would
need
to
fight
before
he
*NL*
got
through
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
had
got
the
habit
of
buying
the
Sunday
paper
whenever
he
had
the
*NL*
money
;
a
most
wonderful
paper
could
be
had
for
only
five
cents
,
a
whole
*NL*
armful
,
with
all
the
news
of
the
world
set
forth
in
big
headlines
,
that
*NL*
Jurgis
could
spell
out
slowly
,
with
the
children
to
help
him
at
the
long
*NL*
words
.
There
was
battle
and
murder
and
sudden
death
--
it
was
marvelous
*NL*
how
they
ever
heard
about
so
many
entertaining
and
thrilling
happenings
;
*NL*
the
stories
must
be
all
true
,
for
surely
no
man
could
have
made
such
*NL*
things
up
,
and
besides
,
there
were
pictures
of
them
all
,
as
real
as
*NL*
life
.
One
of
these
papers
was
as
good
as
a
circus
,
and
nearly
as
good
*NL*
as
a
spree
--
certainly
a
most
wonderful
treat
for
a
workingman
,
who
was
*NL*
tired
out
and
stupefied
,
and
had
never
had
any
education
,
and
whose
work
*NL*
was
one
dull
,
sordid
grind
,
day
after
day
,
and
year
after
year
,
with
*NL*
never
a
sight
of
a
green
field
nor
an
hour
's
entertainment
,
nor
anything
*NL*
but
liquor
to
stimulate
his
imagination
.
Among
other
things
,
these
*NL*
papers
had
pages
full
of
comical
pictures
,
and
these
were
the
main
joy
*NL*
in
life
to
little
Antanas
.
He
treasured
them
up
,
and
would
drag
them
out
*NL*
and
make
his
father
tell
him
about
them
;
there
were
all
sorts
of
animals
*NL*
among
them
,
and
Antanas
could
tell
the
names
of
all
of
them
,
lying
*NL*
upon
the
floor
for
hours
and
pointing
them
out
with
his
chubby
little
*NL*
fingers
.
Whenever
the
story
was
plain
enough
for
Jurgis
to
make
out
,
*NL*
Antanas
would
have
it
repeated
to
him
,
and
then
he
would
remember
it
,
*NL*
prattling
funny
little
sentences
and
mixing
it
up
with
other
stories
in
*NL*
an
irresistible
fashion
.
Also
his
quaint
pronunciation
of
words
was
*NL*
such
a
delight
--
and
the
phrases
he
would
pick
up
and
remember
,
the
most
*NL*
outlandish
and
impossible
things
!
The
first
time
that
the
little
rascal
*NL*
burst
out
with
``
God
damn
,
''
his
father
nearly
rolled
off
the
chair
*NL*
with
glee
;
but
in
the
end
he
was
sorry
for
this
,
for
Antanas
was
soon
*NL*
``
God-damning
''
everything
and
everybody
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
,
when
he
was
able
to
use
his
hands
,
Jurgis
took
his
bedding
*NL*
again
and
went
back
to
his
task
of
shifting
rails
.
It
was
now
April
,
and
*NL*
the
snow
had
given
place
to
cold
rains
,
and
the
unpaved
street
in
front
*NL*
of
Aniele
's
house
was
turned
into
a
canal
.
Jurgis
would
have
to
wade
*NL*
through
it
to
get
home
,
and
if
it
was
late
he
might
easily
get
stuck
to
*NL*
his
waist
in
the
mire
.
But
he
did
not
mind
this
much
--
it
was
a
promise
*NL*
that
summer
was
coming
.
Marija
had
now
gotten
a
place
as
beef-trimmer
*NL*
in
one
of
the
smaller
packing
plants
;
and
he
told
himself
that
he
had
*NL*
learned
his
lesson
now
,
and
would
meet
with
no
more
accidents
--
so
that
*NL*
at
last
there
was
prospect
of
an
end
to
their
long
agony
.
They
could
*NL*
save
money
again
,
and
when
another
winter
came
they
would
have
a
*NL*
comfortable
place
;
and
the
children
would
be
off
the
streets
and
in
*NL*
school
again
,
and
they
might
set
to
work
to
nurse
back
into
life
their
*NL*
habits
of
decency
and
kindness
.
So
once
more
Jurgis
began
to
make
plans
*NL*
and
dream
dreams
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
one
Saturday
night
he
jumped
off
the
car
and
started
home
,
with
*NL*
the
sun
shining
low
under
the
edge
of
a
bank
of
clouds
that
had
been
*NL*
pouring
floods
of
water
into
the
mud-soaked
street
.
There
was
a
rainbow
*NL*
in
the
sky
,
and
another
in
his
breast
--
for
he
had
thirty-six
hours
'
rest
*NL*
before
him
,
and
a
chance
to
see
his
family
.
Then
suddenly
he
came
in
*NL*
sight
of
the
house
,
and
noticed
that
there
was
a
crowd
before
the
door
.
*NL*
He
ran
up
the
steps
and
pushed
his
way
in
,
and
saw
Aniele
's
kitchen
*NL*
crowded
with
excited
women
.
It
reminded
him
so
vividly
of
the
time
when
*NL*
he
had
come
home
from
jail
and
found
Ona
dying
,
that
his
heart
almost
*NL*
stood
still
.
``
What
's
the
matter
?
''
he
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
dead
silence
had
fallen
in
the
room
,
and
he
saw
that
every
one
was
*NL*
staring
at
him
.
``
What
's
the
matter
?
''
he
exclaimed
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
,
up
in
the
garret
,
he
heard
sounds
of
wailing
,
in
Marija
's
*NL*
voice
.
He
started
for
the
ladder
--
and
Aniele
seized
him
by
the
arm
.
``
No
,
*NL*
no
!
''
she
exclaimed
.
``
Do
n't
go
up
there
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
he
shouted
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
old
woman
answered
him
weakly
:
``
It
's
Antanas
.
He
's
dead
.
He
was
*NL*
drowned
out
in
the
street
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
22
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
took
the
news
in
a
peculiar
way
.
He
turned
deadly
pale
,
but
he
*NL*
caught
himself
,
and
for
half
a
minute
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
*NL*
clenching
his
hands
tightly
and
setting
his
teeth
.
Then
he
pushed
Aniele
*NL*
aside
and
strode
into
the
next
room
and
climbed
the
ladder
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
corner
was
a
blanket
,
with
a
form
half
showing
beneath
it
;
and
*NL*
beside
it
lay
Elzbieta
,
whether
crying
or
in
a
faint
,
Jurgis
could
not
*NL*
tell
.
Marija
was
pacing
the
room
,
screaming
and
wringing
her
hands
.
He
*NL*
clenched
his
hands
tighter
yet
,
and
his
voice
was
hard
as
he
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
did
it
happen
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marija
scarcely
heard
him
in
her
agony
.
He
repeated
the
question
,
*NL*
louder
and
yet
more
harshly
.
``
He
fell
off
the
sidewalk
!
''
she
wailed
.
*NL*
The
sidewalk
in
front
of
the
house
was
a
platform
made
of
half-rotten
*NL*
boards
,
about
five
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sunken
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
did
he
come
to
be
there
?
''
he
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
went
--
he
went
out
to
play
,
''
Marija
sobbed
,
her
voice
choking
her
.
*NL*
``
We
could
n't
make
him
stay
in
.
He
must
have
got
caught
in
the
mud
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
sure
that
he
is
dead
?
''
he
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ai
!
ai
!
''
she
wailed
.
``
Yes
;
we
had
the
doctor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Jurgis
stood
a
few
seconds
,
wavering
.
He
did
not
shed
a
tear
.
He
*NL*
took
one
glance
more
at
the
blanket
with
the
little
form
beneath
it
,
*NL*
and
then
turned
suddenly
to
the
ladder
and
climbed
down
again
.
A
silence
*NL*
fell
once
more
in
the
room
as
he
entered
.
He
went
straight
to
the
door
,
*NL*
passed
out
,
and
started
down
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
his
wife
had
died
,
Jurgis
made
for
the
nearest
saloon
,
but
he
did
*NL*
not
do
that
now
,
though
he
had
his
week
's
wages
in
his
pocket
.
He
walked
*NL*
and
walked
,
seeing
nothing
,
splashing
through
mud
and
water
.
Later
on
he
*NL*
sat
down
upon
a
step
and
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
and
for
half
an
hour
*NL*
or
so
he
did
not
move
.
Now
and
then
he
would
whisper
to
himself
:
``
Dead
!
*NL*
Dead
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Finally
,
he
got
up
and
walked
on
again
.
It
was
about
sunset
,
and
he
went
*NL*
on
and
on
until
it
was
dark
,
when
he
was
stopped
by
a
railroad
crossing
.
*NL*
The
gates
were
down
,
and
a
long
train
of
freight
cars
was
thundering
by
.
*NL*
He
stood
and
watched
it
;
and
all
at
once
a
wild
impulse
seized
him
,
a
*NL*
thought
that
had
been
lurking
within
him
,
unspoken
,
unrecognized
,
leaped
*NL*
into
sudden
life
.
He
started
down
the
track
,
and
when
he
was
past
the
*NL*
gate-keeper
's
shanty
he
sprang
forward
and
swung
himself
on
to
one
of
*NL*
the
cars
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
and
by
the
train
stopped
again
,
and
Jurgis
sprang
down
and
ran
under
*NL*
the
car
,
and
hid
himself
upon
the
truck
.
Here
he
sat
,
and
when
the
train
*NL*
started
again
,
he
fought
a
battle
with
his
soul
.
He
gripped
his
hands
*NL*
and
set
his
teeth
together
--
he
had
not
wept
,
and
he
would
not
--
not
a
*NL*
tear
!
It
was
past
and
over
,
and
he
was
done
with
it
--
he
would
fling
it
*NL*
off
his
shoulders
,
be
free
of
it
,
the
whole
business
,
that
night
.
It
*NL*
should
go
like
a
black
,
hateful
nightmare
,
and
in
the
morning
he
would
*NL*
be
a
new
man
.
And
every
time
that
a
thought
of
it
assailed
him
--
a
tender
*NL*
memory
,
a
trace
of
a
tear
--
he
rose
up
,
cursing
with
rage
,
and
pounded
it
*NL*
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
fighting
for
his
life
;
he
gnashed
his
teeth
together
in
his
*NL*
desperation
.
He
had
been
a
fool
,
a
fool
!
He
had
wasted
his
life
,
he
had
*NL*
wrecked
himself
,
with
his
accursed
weakness
;
and
now
he
was
done
with
*NL*
it
--
he
would
tear
it
out
of
him
,
root
and
branch
!
There
should
be
no
*NL*
more
tears
and
no
more
tenderness
;
he
had
had
enough
of
them
--
they
had
*NL*
sold
him
into
slavery
!
Now
he
was
going
to
be
free
,
to
tear
off
his
*NL*
shackles
,
to
rise
up
and
fight
.
He
was
glad
that
the
end
had
come
--
it
*NL*
had
to
come
some
time
,
and
it
was
just
as
well
now
.
This
was
no
world
*NL*
for
women
and
children
,
and
the
sooner
they
got
out
of
it
the
better
*NL*
for
them
.
Whatever
Antanas
might
suffer
where
he
was
,
he
could
suffer
*NL*
no
more
than
he
would
have
had
he
stayed
upon
earth
.
And
meantime
his
*NL*
father
had
thought
the
last
thought
about
him
that
he
meant
to
;
he
was
*NL*
going
to
think
of
himself
,
he
was
going
to
fight
for
himself
,
against
*NL*
the
world
that
had
baffled
him
and
tortured
him
!
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
went
on
,
tearing
up
all
the
flowers
from
the
garden
of
his
soul
,
*NL*
and
setting
his
heel
upon
them
.
The
train
thundered
deafeningly
,
and
*NL*
a
storm
of
dust
blew
in
his
face
;
but
though
it
stopped
now
and
then
*NL*
through
the
night
,
he
clung
where
he
was
--
he
would
cling
there
until
*NL*
he
was
driven
off
,
for
every
mile
that
he
got
from
Packingtown
meant
*NL*
another
load
from
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whenever
the
cars
stopped
a
warm
breeze
blew
upon
him
,
a
breeze
laden
*NL*
with
the
perfume
of
fresh
fields
,
of
honeysuckle
and
clover
.
He
snuffed
*NL*
it
,
and
it
made
his
heart
beat
wildly
--
he
was
out
in
the
country
again
!
*NL*
He
was
going
to
live
in
the
country
!
When
the
dawn
came
he
was
peering
*NL*
out
with
hungry
eyes
,
getting
glimpses
of
meadows
and
woods
and
rivers
.
*NL*
At
last
he
could
stand
it
no
longer
,
and
when
the
train
stopped
again
he
*NL*
crawled
out
.
Upon
the
top
of
the
car
was
a
brakeman
,
who
shook
his
fist
*NL*
and
swore
;
Jurgis
waved
his
hand
derisively
,
and
started
across
the
*NL*
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
think
that
he
had
been
a
countryman
all
his
life
;
and
for
three
*NL*
long
years
he
had
never
seen
a
country
sight
nor
heard
a
country
sound
!
*NL*
Excepting
for
that
one
walk
when
he
left
jail
,
when
he
was
too
much
*NL*
worried
to
notice
anything
,
and
for
a
few
times
that
he
had
rested
*NL*
in
the
city
parks
in
the
winter
time
when
he
was
out
of
work
,
he
had
*NL*
literally
never
seen
a
tree
!
And
now
he
felt
like
a
bird
lifted
up
*NL*
and
borne
away
upon
a
gale
;
he
stopped
and
stared
at
each
new
sight
of
*NL*
wonder
--
at
a
herd
of
cows
,
and
a
meadow
full
of
daisies
,
at
hedgerows
*NL*
set
thick
with
June
roses
,
at
little
birds
singing
in
the
trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
came
to
a
farm-house
,
and
after
getting
himself
a
stick
for
*NL*
protection
,
he
approached
it
.
The
farmer
was
greasing
a
wagon
in
*NL*
front
of
the
barn
,
and
Jurgis
went
to
him
.
``
I
would
like
to
get
some
*NL*
breakfast
,
please
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
want
to
work
?
''
said
the
farmer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Jurgis
.
``
I
do
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
ca
n't
get
anything
here
,
''
snapped
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
meant
to
pay
for
it
,
''
said
Jurgis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
said
the
farmer
;
and
then
added
sarcastically
,
``
We
do
n't
serve
*NL*
breakfast
after
7
A.M.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
hungry
,
''
said
Jurgis
gravely
;
``
I
would
like
to
buy
some
*NL*
food
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ask
the
woman
,
''
said
the
farmer
,
nodding
over
his
shoulder
.
The
``
woman
''
*NL*
was
more
tractable
,
and
for
a
dime
Jurgis
secured
two
thick
sandwiches
*NL*
and
a
piece
of
pie
and
two
apples
.
He
walked
off
eating
the
pie
,
as
the
*NL*
least
convenient
thing
to
carry
.
In
a
few
minutes
he
came
to
a
stream
,
*NL*
and
he
climbed
a
fence
and
walked
down
the
bank
,
along
a
woodland
path
.
*NL*
By
and
by
he
found
a
comfortable
spot
,
and
there
he
devoured
his
meal
,
*NL*
slaking
his
thirst
at
the
stream
.
Then
he
lay
for
hours
,
just
gazing
and
*NL*
drinking
in
joy
;
until
at
last
he
felt
sleepy
,
and
lay
down
in
the
shade
*NL*
of
a
bush
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
awoke
the
sun
was
shining
hot
in
his
face
.
He
sat
up
and
*NL*
stretched
his
arms
,
and
then
gazed
at
the
water
sliding
by
.
There
was
a
*NL*
deep
pool
,
sheltered
and
silent
,
below
him
,
and
a
sudden
wonderful
idea
*NL*
rushed
upon
him
.
He
might
have
a
bath
!
The
water
was
free
,
and
he
might
*NL*
get
into
it
--
all
the
way
into
it
!
It
would
be
the
first
time
that
he
had
*NL*
been
all
the
way
into
the
water
since
he
left
Lithuania
!
*NL*
*NL*
When
Jurgis
had
first
come
to
the
stockyards
he
had
been
as
clean
as
any
*NL*
workingman
could
well
be
.
But
later
on
,
what
with
sickness
and
cold
*NL*
and
hunger
and
discouragement
,
and
the
filthiness
of
his
work
,
and
the
*NL*
vermin
in
his
home
,
he
had
given
up
washing
in
winter
,
and
in
summer
*NL*
only
as
much
of
him
as
would
go
into
a
basin
.
He
had
had
a
shower
bath
*NL*
in
jail
,
but
nothing
since
--
and
now
he
would
have
a
swim
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
water
was
warm
,
and
he
splashed
about
like
a
very
boy
in
his
glee
.
*NL*
Afterward
he
sat
down
in
the
water
near
the
bank
,
and
proceeded
to
scrub
*NL*
himself
--
soberly
and
methodically
,
scouring
every
inch
of
him
with
sand
.
*NL*
While
he
was
doing
it
he
would
do
it
thoroughly
,
and
see
how
it
felt
to
*NL*
be
clean
.
He
even
scrubbed
his
head
with
sand
,
and
combed
what
the
men
*NL*
called
``
crumbs
''
out
of
his
long
,
black
hair
,
holding
his
head
under
*NL*
water
as
long
as
he
could
,
to
see
if
he
could
not
kill
them
all
.
Then
,
*NL*
seeing
that
the
sun
was
still
hot
,
he
took
his
clothes
from
the
bank
*NL*
and
proceeded
to
wash
them
,
piece
by
piece
;
as
the
dirt
and
grease
went
*NL*
floating
off
downstream
he
grunted
with
satisfaction
and
soused
the
*NL*
clothes
again
,
venturing
even
to
dream
that
he
might
get
rid
of
the
*NL*
fertilizer
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
hung
them
all
up
,
and
while
they
were
drying
he
lay
down
in
the
sun
*NL*
and
had
another
long
sleep
.
They
were
hot
and
stiff
as
boards
on
top
,
*NL*
and
a
little
damp
on
the
underside
,
when
he
awakened
;
but
being
hungry
,
*NL*
he
put
them
on
and
set
out
again
.
He
had
no
knife
,
but
with
some
labor
*NL*
he
broke
himself
a
good
stout
club
,
and
,
armed
with
this
,
he
marched
*NL*
down
the
road
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
long
he
came
to
a
big
farmhouse
,
and
turned
up
the
lane
that
led
*NL*
to
it
.
It
was
just
supper-time
,
and
the
farmer
was
washing
his
hands
at
*NL*
the
kitchen
door
.
``
Please
,
sir
,
''
said
Jurgis
,
``
can
I
have
something
to
*NL*
eat
?
I
can
pay
.
''
To
which
the
farmer
responded
promptly
,
``
We
do
n't
feed
*NL*
tramps
here
.
Get
out
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
went
without
a
word
;
but
as
he
passed
round
the
barn
he
came
to
*NL*
a
freshly
ploughed
and
harrowed
field
,
in
which
the
farmer
had
set
out
*NL*
some
young
peach
trees
;
and
as
he
walked
he
jerked
up
a
row
of
them
by
*NL*
the
roots
,
more
than
a
hundred
trees
in
all
,
before
he
reached
the
end
*NL*
of
the
field
.
That
was
his
answer
,
and
it
showed
his
mood
;
from
now
on
*NL*
he
was
fighting
,
and
the
man
who
hit
him
would
get
all
that
he
gave
,
*NL*
every
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beyond
the
orchard
Jurgis
struck
through
a
patch
of
woods
,
and
then
a
*NL*
field
of
winter
grain
,
and
came
at
last
to
another
road
.
Before
long
he
*NL*
saw
another
farmhouse
,
and
,
as
it
was
beginning
to
cloud
over
a
little
,
*NL*
he
asked
here
for
shelter
as
well
as
food
.
Seeing
the
farmer
eying
him
*NL*
dubiously
,
he
added
,
``
I
'll
be
glad
to
sleep
in
the
barn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
dunno
,
''
said
the
other
.
``
Do
you
smoke
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sometimes
,
''
said
Jurgis
,
``
but
I
'll
do
it
out
of
doors
.
''
When
the
man
*NL*
had
assented
,
he
inquired
,
``
How
much
will
it
cost
me
?
I
have
n't
very
*NL*
much
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
reckon
about
twenty
cents
for
supper
,
''
replied
the
farmer
.
``
I
wo
n't
*NL*
charge
ye
for
the
barn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
Jurgis
went
in
,
and
sat
down
at
the
table
with
the
farmer
's
wife
and
*NL*
half
a
dozen
children
.
It
was
a
bountiful
meal
--
there
were
baked
beans
*NL*
and
mashed
potatoes
and
asparagus
chopped
and
stewed
,
and
a
dish
of
*NL*
strawberries
,
and
great
,
thick
slices
of
bread
,
and
a
pitcher
of
milk
.
*NL*
Jurgis
had
not
had
such
a
feast
since
his
wedding
day
,
and
he
made
a
*NL*
mighty
effort
to
put
in
his
twenty
cents
'
worth
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
all
of
them
too
hungry
to
talk
;
but
afterward
they
sat
upon
*NL*
the
steps
and
smoked
,
and
the
farmer
questioned
his
guest
.
When
Jurgis
*NL*
had
explained
that
he
was
a
workingman
from
Chicago
,
and
that
he
did
not
*NL*
know
just
whither
he
was
bound
,
the
other
said
,
``
Why
do
n't
you
stay
here
*NL*
and
work
for
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
looking
for
work
just
now
,
''
Jurgis
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
pay
ye
good
,
''
said
the
other
,
eying
his
big
form
--
``
a
dollar
a
day
*NL*
and
board
ye
.
Help
's
terrible
scarce
round
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
winter
as
well
as
summer
?
''
Jurgis
demanded
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
N
--
no
,
''
said
the
farmer
;
``
I
could
n't
keep
ye
after
November
--
I
ai
n't
*NL*
got
a
big
enough
place
for
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
,
''
said
the
other
,
``
that
's
what
I
thought
.
When
you
get
through
*NL*
working
your
horses
this
fall
,
will
you
turn
them
out
in
the
snow
?
''
*NL*
-LRB-
Jurgis
was
beginning
to
think
for
himself
nowadays
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
ai
n't
quite
the
same
,
''
the
farmer
answered
,
seeing
the
point
.
``
There
*NL*
ought
to
be
work
a
strong
fellow
like
you
can
find
to
do
,
in
the
cities
,
*NL*
or
some
place
,
in
the
winter
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Jurgis
,
``
that
's
what
they
all
think
;
and
so
they
crowd
into
*NL*
the
cities
,
and
when
they
have
to
beg
or
steal
to
live
,
then
people
*NL*
ask
'em
why
they
do
n't
go
into
the
country
,
where
help
is
scarce
.
''
The
*NL*
farmer
meditated
awhile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
about
when
your
money
's
gone
?
''
he
inquired
,
finally
.
``
You
'll
have
*NL*
to
,
then
,
wo
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
till
she
's
gone
,
''
said
Jurgis
;
``
then
I
'll
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
a
long
sleep
in
the
barn
and
then
a
big
breakfast
of
coffee
and
*NL*
bread
and
oatmeal
and
stewed
cherries
,
for
which
the
man
charged
him
*NL*
only
fifteen
cents
,
perhaps
having
been
influenced
by
his
arguments
.
*NL*
Then
Jurgis
bade
farewell
,
and
went
on
his
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
the
beginning
of
his
life
as
a
tramp
.
It
was
seldom
he
got
*NL*
as
fair
treatment
as
from
this
last
farmer
,
and
so
as
time
went
on
he
*NL*
learned
to
shun
the
houses
and
to
prefer
sleeping
in
the
fields
.
When
*NL*
it
rained
he
would
find
a
deserted
building
,
if
he
could
,
and
if
not
,
*NL*
he
would
wait
until
after
dark
and
then
,
with
his
stick
ready
,
begin
a
*NL*
stealthy
approach
upon
a
barn
.
Generally
he
could
get
in
before
the
dog
*NL*
got
scent
of
him
,
and
then
he
would
hide
in
the
hay
and
be
safe
until
*NL*
morning
;
if
not
,
and
the
dog
attacked
him
,
he
would
rise
up
and
make
a
*NL*
retreat
in
battle
order
.
Jurgis
was
not
the
mighty
man
he
had
once
been
,
*NL*
but
his
arms
were
still
good
,
and
there
were
few
farm
dogs
he
needed
to
*NL*
hit
more
than
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
long
there
came
raspberries
,
and
then
blackberries
,
to
help
him
*NL*
save
his
money
;
and
there
were
apples
in
the
orchards
and
potatoes
in
*NL*
the
ground
--
he
learned
to
note
the
places
and
fill
his
pockets
after
*NL*
dark
.
Twice
he
even
managed
to
capture
a
chicken
,
and
had
a
feast
,
once
*NL*
in
a
deserted
barn
and
the
other
time
in
a
lonely
spot
alongside
of
a
*NL*
stream
.
When
all
of
these
things
failed
him
he
used
his
money
carefully
,
*NL*
but
without
worry
--
for
he
saw
that
he
could
earn
more
whenever
he
chose
.
*NL*
Half
an
hour
's
chopping
wood
in
his
lively
fashion
was
enough
to
bring
*NL*
him
a
meal
,
and
when
the
farmer
had
seen
him
working
he
would
sometimes
*NL*
try
to
bribe
him
to
stay
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Jurgis
was
not
staying
.
He
was
a
free
man
now
,
a
buccaneer
.
The
old
*NL*
wanderlust
had
got
into
his
blood
,
the
joy
of
the
unbound
life
,
the
*NL*
joy
of
seeking
,
of
hoping
without
limit
.
There
were
mishaps
and
*NL*
discomforts
--
but
at
least
there
was
always
something
new
;
and
only
think
*NL*
what
it
meant
to
a
man
who
for
years
had
been
penned
up
in
one
place
,
*NL*
seeing
nothing
but
one
dreary
prospect
of
shanties
and
factories
,
to
be
*NL*
suddenly
set
loose
beneath
the
open
sky
,
to
behold
new
landscapes
,
*NL*
new
places
,
and
new
people
every
hour
!
To
a
man
whose
whole
life
had
*NL*
consisted
of
doing
one
certain
thing
all
day
,
until
he
was
so
exhausted
*NL*
that
he
could
only
lie
down
and
sleep
until
the
next
day
--
and
to
be
now
*NL*
his
own
master
,
working
as
he
pleased
and
when
he
pleased
,
and
facing
a
*NL*
new
adventure
every
hour
!
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
too
,
his
health
came
back
to
him
,
all
his
lost
youthful
vigor
,
his
*NL*
joy
and
power
that
he
had
mourned
and
forgotten
!
It
came
with
a
sudden
*NL*
rush
,
bewildering
him
,
startling
him
;
it
was
as
if
his
dead
childhood
*NL*
had
come
back
to
him
,
laughing
and
calling
!
What
with
plenty
to
eat
and
*NL*
fresh
air
and
exercise
that
was
taken
as
it
pleased
him
,
he
would
waken
*NL*
from
his
sleep
and
start
off
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
his
energy
,
*NL*
stretching
his
arms
,
laughing
,
singing
old
songs
of
home
that
came
back
*NL*
to
him
.
Now
and
then
,
of
course
,
he
could
not
help
but
think
of
little
*NL*
Antanas
,
whom
he
should
never
see
again
,
whose
little
voice
he
should
*NL*
never
hear
;
and
then
he
would
have
to
battle
with
himself
.
Sometimes
at
*NL*
night
he
would
waken
dreaming
of
Ona
,
and
stretch
out
his
arms
to
her
,
*NL*
and
wet
the
ground
with
his
tears
.
But
in
the
morning
he
would
get
up
*NL*
and
shake
himself
,
and
stride
away
again
to
battle
with
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
never
asked
where
he
was
nor
where
he
was
going
;
the
country
was
big
*NL*
enough
,
he
knew
,
and
there
was
no
danger
of
his
coming
to
the
end
of
it
.
*NL*
And
of
course
he
could
always
have
company
for
the
asking
--
everywhere
he
*NL*
went
there
were
men
living
just
as
he
lived
,
and
whom
he
was
welcome
to
*NL*
join
.
He
was
a
stranger
at
the
business
,
but
they
were
not
clannish
,
and
*NL*
they
taught
him
all
their
tricks
--
what
towns
and
villages
it
was
best
*NL*
to
keep
away
from
,
and
how
to
read
the
secret
signs
upon
the
fences
,
and
*NL*
when
to
beg
and
when
to
steal
,
and
just
how
to
do
both
.
They
laughed
at
*NL*
his
ideas
of
paying
for
anything
with
money
or
with
work
--
for
they
got
*NL*
all
they
wanted
without
either
.
Now
and
then
Jurgis
camped
out
with
*NL*
a
gang
of
them
in
some
woodland
haunt
,
and
foraged
with
them
in
the
*NL*
neighborhood
at
night
.
And
then
among
them
some
one
would
``
take
a
shine
''
*NL*
to
him
,
and
they
would
go
off
together
and
travel
for
a
week
,
exchanging
*NL*
reminiscences
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
these
professional
tramps
a
great
many
had
,
of
course
,
been
shiftless
*NL*
and
vicious
all
their
lives
.
But
the
vast
majority
of
them
had
been
*NL*
workingmen
,
had
fought
the
long
fight
as
Jurgis
had
,
and
found
that
it
*NL*
was
a
losing
fight
,
and
given
up
.
Later
on
he
encountered
yet
another
*NL*
sort
of
men
,
those
from
whose
ranks
the
tramps
were
recruited
,
men
who
*NL*
were
homeless
and
wandering
,
but
still
seeking
work
--
seeking
it
in
the
*NL*
harvest
fields
.
Of
these
there
was
an
army
,
the
huge
surplus
labor
army
*NL*
of
society
;
called
into
being
under
the
stern
system
of
nature
,
to
*NL*
do
the
casual
work
of
the
world
,
the
tasks
which
were
transient
and
*NL*
irregular
,
and
yet
which
had
to
be
done
.
They
did
not
know
that
they
*NL*
were
such
,
of
course
;
they
only
knew
that
they
sought
the
job
,
and
that
*NL*
the
job
was
fleeting
.
In
the
early
summer
they
would
be
in
Texas
,
and
*NL*
as
the
crops
were
ready
they
would
follow
north
with
the
season
,
ending
*NL*
with
the
fall
in
Manitoba
.
Then
they
would
seek
out
the
big
lumber
*NL*
camps
,
where
there
was
winter
work
;
or
failing
in
this
,
would
drift
to
*NL*
the
cities
,
and
live
upon
what
they
had
managed
to
save
,
with
the
*NL*
help
of
such
transient
work
as
was
there
the
loading
and
unloading
of
*NL*
steamships
and
drays
,
the
digging
of
ditches
and
the
shoveling
of
snow
.
*NL*
If
there
were
more
of
them
on
hand
than
chanced
to
be
needed
,
the
weaker
*NL*
ones
died
off
of
cold
and
hunger
,
again
according
to
the
stern
system
of
*NL*
nature
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
the
latter
part
of
July
,
when
Jurgis
was
in
Missouri
,
that
*NL*
he
came
upon
the
harvest
work
.
Here
were
crops
that
men
had
worked
for
*NL*
three
or
four
months
to
prepare
,
and
of
which
they
would
lose
nearly
*NL*
all
unless
they
could
find
others
to
help
them
for
a
week
or
two
.
So
all
*NL*
over
the
land
there
was
a
cry
for
labor
--
agencies
were
set
up
and
all
*NL*
the
cities
were
drained
of
men
,
even
college
boys
were
brought
by
the
*NL*
carload
,
and
hordes
of
frantic
farmers
would
hold
up
trains
and
carry
*NL*
off
wagon-loads
of
men
by
main
force
.
Not
that
they
did
not
pay
them
*NL*
well
--
any
man
could
get
two
dollars
a
day
and
his
board
,
and
the
best
*NL*
men
could
get
two
dollars
and
a
half
or
three
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
harvest-fever
was
in
the
very
air
,
and
no
man
with
any
spirit
in
*NL*
him
could
be
in
that
region
and
not
catch
it
.
Jurgis
joined
a
gang
and
*NL*
worked
from
dawn
till
dark
,
eighteen
hours
a
day
,
for
two
weeks
without
*NL*
a
break
.
Then
he
had
a
sum
of
money
that
would
have
been
a
fortune
to
*NL*
him
in
the
old
days
of
misery
--
but
what
could
he
do
with
it
now
?
To
be
*NL*
sure
he
might
have
put
it
in
a
bank
,
and
,
if
he
were
fortunate
,
get
*NL*
it
back
again
when
he
wanted
it
.
But
Jurgis
was
now
a
homeless
man
,
*NL*
wandering
over
a
continent
;
and
what
did
he
know
about
banking
and
*NL*
drafts
and
letters
of
credit
?
If
he
carried
the
money
about
with
him
,
he
*NL*
would
surely
be
robbed
in
the
end
;
and
so
what
was
there
for
him
to
do
*NL*
but
enjoy
it
while
he
could
?
On
a
Saturday
night
he
drifted
into
a
town
*NL*
with
his
fellows
;
and
because
it
was
raining
,
and
there
was
no
other
*NL*
place
provided
for
him
,
he
went
to
a
saloon
.
And
there
were
some
who
*NL*
treated
him
and
whom
he
had
to
treat
,
and
there
was
laughter
and
singing
*NL*
and
good
cheer
;
and
then
out
of
the
rear
part
of
the
saloon
a
girl
's
*NL*
face
,
red-cheeked
and
merry
,
smiled
at
Jurgis
,
and
his
heart
thumped
*NL*
suddenly
in
his
throat
.
He
nodded
to
her
,
and
she
came
and
sat
by
him
,
*NL*
and
they
had
more
drink
,
and
then
he
went
upstairs
into
a
room
with
her
,
*NL*
and
the
wild
beast
rose
up
within
him
and
screamed
,
as
it
has
screamed
*NL*
in
the
Jungle
from
the
dawn
of
time
.
And
then
because
of
his
memories
*NL*
and
his
shame
,
he
was
glad
when
others
joined
them
,
men
and
women
;
and
*NL*
they
had
more
drink
and
spent
the
night
in
wild
rioting
and
debauchery
.
*NL*
In
the
van
of
the
surplus-labor
army
,
there
followed
another
,
an
army
of
*NL*
women
,
they
also
struggling
for
life
under
the
stern
system
of
nature
.
*NL*
Because
there
were
rich
men
who
sought
pleasure
,
there
had
been
ease
and
*NL*
plenty
for
them
so
long
as
they
were
young
and
beautiful
;
and
later
on
,
*NL*
when
they
were
crowded
out
by
others
younger
and
more
beautiful
,
they
*NL*
went
out
to
follow
upon
the
trail
of
the
workingmen
.
Sometimes
they
came
*NL*
of
themselves
,
and
the
saloon-keepers
shared
with
them
;
or
sometimes
*NL*
they
were
handled
by
agencies
,
the
same
as
the
labor
army
.
They
were
in
*NL*
the
towns
in
harvest
time
,
near
the
lumber
camps
in
the
winter
,
in
*NL*
the
cities
when
the
men
came
there
;
if
a
regiment
were
encamped
,
or
a
*NL*
railroad
or
canal
being
made
,
or
a
great
exposition
getting
ready
,
the
*NL*
crowd
of
women
were
on
hand
,
living
in
shanties
or
saloons
or
tenement
*NL*
rooms
,
sometimes
eight
or
ten
of
them
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
Jurgis
had
not
a
cent
,
and
he
went
out
upon
the
road
*NL*
again
.
He
was
sick
and
disgusted
,
but
after
the
new
plan
of
his
life
,
he
*NL*
crushed
his
feelings
down
.
He
had
made
a
fool
of
himself
,
but
he
could
*NL*
not
help
it
now
--
all
he
could
do
was
to
see
that
it
did
not
happen
*NL*
again
.
So
he
tramped
on
until
exercise
and
fresh
air
banished
his
*NL*
headache
,
and
his
strength
and
joy
returned
.
This
happened
to
him
every
*NL*
time
,
for
Jurgis
was
still
a
creature
of
impulse
,
and
his
pleasures
had
*NL*
not
yet
become
business
.
It
would
be
a
long
time
before
he
could
be
like
*NL*
the
majority
of
these
men
of
the
road
,
who
roamed
until
the
hunger
for
*NL*
drink
and
for
women
mastered
them
,
and
then
went
to
work
with
a
purpose
*NL*
in
mind
,
and
stopped
when
they
had
the
price
of
a
spree
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
contrary
,
try
as
he
would
,
Jurgis
could
not
help
being
made
*NL*
miserable
by
his
conscience
.
It
was
the
ghost
that
would
not
down
.
It
*NL*
would
come
upon
him
in
the
most
unexpected
places
--
sometimes
it
fairly
*NL*
drove
him
to
drink
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
night
he
was
caught
by
a
thunderstorm
,
and
he
sought
shelter
in
a
*NL*
little
house
just
outside
of
a
town
.
It
was
a
working-man
's
home
,
and
*NL*
the
owner
was
a
Slav
like
himself
,
a
new
emigrant
from
White
Russia
;
he
*NL*
bade
Jurgis
welcome
in
his
home
language
,
and
told
him
to
come
to
the
*NL*
kitchen-fire
and
dry
himself
.
He
had
no
bed
for
him
,
but
there
was
straw
*NL*
in
the
garret
,
and
he
could
make
out
.
The
man
's
wife
was
cooking
the
*NL*
supper
,
and
their
children
were
playing
about
on
the
floor
.
Jurgis
sat
*NL*
and
exchanged
thoughts
with
him
about
the
old
country
,
and
the
places
*NL*
where
they
had
been
and
the
work
they
had
done
.
Then
they
ate
,
and
*NL*
afterward
sat
and
smoked
and
talked
more
about
America
,
and
how
they
*NL*
found
it
.
In
the
middle
of
a
sentence
,
however
,
Jurgis
stopped
,
seeing
*NL*
that
the
woman
had
brought
a
big
basin
of
water
and
was
proceeding
to
*NL*
undress
her
youngest
baby
.
The
rest
had
crawled
into
the
closet
where
*NL*
they
slept
,
but
the
baby
was
to
have
a
bath
,
the
workingman
explained
.
*NL*
The
nights
had
begun
to
be
chilly
,
and
his
mother
,
ignorant
as
to
the
*NL*
climate
in
America
,
had
sewed
him
up
for
the
winter
;
then
it
had
turned
*NL*
warm
again
,
and
some
kind
of
a
rash
had
broken
out
on
the
child
.
The
*NL*
doctor
had
said
she
must
bathe
him
every
night
,
and
she
,
foolish
woman
,
*NL*
believed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
scarcely
heard
the
explanation
;
he
was
watching
the
baby
.
He
was
*NL*
about
a
year
old
,
and
a
sturdy
little
fellow
,
with
soft
fat
legs
,
and
a
*NL*
round
ball
of
a
stomach
,
and
eyes
as
black
as
coals
.
His
pimples
did
*NL*
not
seem
to
bother
him
much
,
and
he
was
wild
with
glee
over
the
bath
,
*NL*
kicking
and
squirming
and
chuckling
with
delight
,
pulling
at
his
*NL*
mother
's
face
and
then
at
his
own
little
toes
.
When
she
put
him
into
the
*NL*
basin
he
sat
in
the
midst
of
it
and
grinned
,
splashing
the
water
over
*NL*
himself
and
squealing
like
a
little
pig
.
He
spoke
in
Russian
,
of
which
*NL*
Jurgis
knew
some
;
he
spoke
it
with
the
quaintest
of
baby
accents
--
and
*NL*
every
word
of
it
brought
back
to
Jurgis
some
word
of
his
own
dead
little
*NL*
one
,
and
stabbed
him
like
a
knife
.
He
sat
perfectly
motionless
,
silent
,
*NL*
but
gripping
his
hands
tightly
,
while
a
storm
gathered
in
his
bosom
and
*NL*
a
flood
heaped
itself
up
behind
his
eyes
.
And
in
the
end
he
could
bear
*NL*
it
no
more
,
but
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
and
burst
into
tears
,
to
*NL*
the
alarm
and
amazement
of
his
hosts
.
Between
the
shame
of
this
and
his
*NL*
woe
Jurgis
could
not
stand
it
,
and
got
up
and
rushed
out
into
the
rain
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
on
and
on
down
the
road
,
finally
coming
to
a
black
woods
,
where
*NL*
he
hid
and
wept
as
if
his
heart
would
break
.
Ah
,
what
agony
was
that
,
*NL*
what
despair
,
when
the
tomb
of
memory
was
rent
open
and
the
ghosts
of
*NL*
his
old
life
came
forth
to
scourge
him
!
What
terror
to
see
what
he
had
*NL*
been
and
now
could
never
be
--
to
see
Ona
and
his
child
and
his
own
dead
*NL*
self
stretching
out
their
arms
to
him
,
calling
to
him
across
a
bottomless
*NL*
abyss
--
and
to
know
that
they
were
gone
from
him
forever
,
and
he
writhing
*NL*
and
suffocating
in
the
mire
of
his
own
vileness
!

Chapter
23
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Early
in
the
fall
Jurgis
set
out
for
Chicago
again
.
All
the
joy
went
out
*NL*
of
tramping
as
soon
as
a
man
could
not
keep
warm
in
the
hay
;
and
,
like
*NL*
many
thousands
of
others
,
he
deluded
himself
with
the
hope
that
by
*NL*
coming
early
he
could
avoid
the
rush
.
He
brought
fifteen
dollars
with
*NL*
him
,
hidden
away
in
one
of
his
shoes
,
a
sum
which
had
been
saved
from
*NL*
the
saloon-keepers
,
not
so
much
by
his
conscience
,
as
by
the
fear
which
*NL*
filled
him
at
the
thought
of
being
out
of
work
in
the
city
in
the
winter
*NL*
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
traveled
upon
the
railroad
with
several
other
men
,
hiding
in
freight
*NL*
cars
at
night
,
and
liable
to
be
thrown
off
at
any
time
,
regardless
of
*NL*
the
speed
of
the
train
.
When
he
reached
the
city
he
left
the
rest
,
for
*NL*
he
had
money
and
they
did
not
,
and
he
meant
to
save
himself
in
this
*NL*
fight
.
He
would
bring
to
it
all
the
skill
that
practice
had
brought
him
,
*NL*
and
he
would
stand
,
whoever
fell
.
On
fair
nights
he
would
sleep
in
the
*NL*
park
or
on
a
truck
or
an
empty
barrel
or
box
,
and
when
it
was
rainy
or
*NL*
cold
he
would
stow
himself
upon
a
shelf
in
a
ten-cent
lodging-house
,
*NL*
or
pay
three
cents
for
the
privileges
of
a
``
squatter
''
in
a
tenement
*NL*
hallway
.
He
would
eat
at
free
lunches
,
five
cents
a
meal
,
and
never
a
*NL*
cent
more
--
so
he
might
keep
alive
for
two
months
and
more
,
and
in
that
*NL*
time
he
would
surely
find
a
job
.
He
would
have
to
bid
farewell
to
*NL*
his
summer
cleanliness
,
of
course
,
for
he
would
come
out
of
the
first
*NL*
night
's
lodging
with
his
clothes
alive
with
vermin
.
There
was
no
place
*NL*
in
the
city
where
he
could
wash
even
his
face
,
unless
he
went
down
to
*NL*
the
lake
front
--
and
there
it
would
soon
be
all
ice
.
*NL*
*NL*
First
he
went
to
the
steel
mill
and
the
harvester
works
,
and
found
that
*NL*
his
places
there
had
been
filled
long
ago
.
He
was
careful
to
keep
away
*NL*
from
the
stockyards
--
he
was
a
single
man
now
,
he
told
himself
,
and
he
*NL*
meant
to
stay
one
,
to
have
his
wages
for
his
own
when
he
got
a
job
.
He
*NL*
began
the
long
,
weary
round
of
factories
and
warehouses
,
tramping
all
*NL*
day
,
from
one
end
of
the
city
to
the
other
,
finding
everywhere
from
ten
*NL*
to
a
hundred
men
ahead
of
him
.
He
watched
the
newspapers
,
too
--
but
no
*NL*
longer
was
he
to
be
taken
in
by
smooth-spoken
agents
.
He
had
been
told
*NL*
of
all
those
tricks
while
``
on
the
road
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
end
it
was
through
a
newspaper
that
he
got
a
job
,
after
nearly
*NL*
a
month
of
seeking
.
It
was
a
call
for
a
hundred
laborers
,
and
though
he
*NL*
thought
it
was
a
``
fake
,
''
he
went
because
the
place
was
near
by
.
He
found
*NL*
a
line
of
men
a
block
long
,
but
as
a
wagon
chanced
to
come
out
of
an
*NL*
alley
and
break
the
line
,
he
saw
his
chance
and
sprang
to
seize
a
place
.
*NL*
Men
threatened
him
and
tried
to
throw
him
out
,
but
he
cursed
and
made
*NL*
a
disturbance
to
attract
a
policeman
,
upon
which
they
subsided
,
knowing
*NL*
that
if
the
latter
interfered
it
would
be
to
``
fire
''
them
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
hour
or
two
later
he
entered
a
room
and
confronted
a
big
Irishman
*NL*
behind
a
desk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ever
worked
in
Chicago
before
?
''
the
man
inquired
;
and
whether
it
was
*NL*
a
good
angel
that
put
it
into
Jurgis
's
mind
,
or
an
intuition
of
his
*NL*
sharpened
wits
,
he
was
moved
to
answer
,
``
No
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
do
you
come
from
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kansas
City
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Any
references
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
.
I
'm
just
an
unskilled
man
.
I
've
got
good
arms
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
men
for
hard
work
--
it
's
all
underground
,
digging
tunnels
for
*NL*
telephones
.
Maybe
it
wo
n't
suit
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
willing
,
sir
--
anything
for
me
.
What
's
the
pay
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fifteen
cents
an
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
willing
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
;
go
back
there
and
give
your
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
within
half
an
hour
he
was
at
work
,
far
underneath
the
streets
of
the
*NL*
city
.
The
tunnel
was
a
peculiar
one
for
telephone
wires
;
it
was
*NL*
about
eight
feet
high
,
and
with
a
level
floor
nearly
as
wide
.
It
had
*NL*
innumerable
branches
--
a
perfect
spider
web
beneath
the
city
;
Jurgis
*NL*
walked
over
half
a
mile
with
his
gang
to
the
place
where
they
were
to
*NL*
work
.
Stranger
yet
,
the
tunnel
was
lighted
by
electricity
,
and
upon
it
*NL*
was
laid
a
double-tracked
,
narrow-gauge
railroad
!
*NL*
*NL*
But
Jurgis
was
not
there
to
ask
questions
,
and
he
did
not
give
the
*NL*
matter
a
thought
.
It
was
nearly
a
year
afterward
that
he
finally
learned
*NL*
the
meaning
of
this
whole
affair
.
The
City
Council
had
passed
a
quiet
*NL*
and
innocent
little
bill
allowing
a
company
to
construct
telephone
*NL*
conduits
under
the
city
streets
;
and
upon
the
strength
of
this
,
a
great
*NL*
corporation
had
proceeded
to
tunnel
all
Chicago
with
a
system
of
railway
*NL*
freight-subways
.
In
the
city
there
was
a
combination
of
employers
,
*NL*
representing
hundreds
of
millions
of
capital
,
and
formed
for
the
purpose
*NL*
of
crushing
the
labor
unions
.
The
chief
union
which
troubled
it
was
the
*NL*
teamsters
'
;
and
when
these
freight
tunnels
were
completed
,
connecting
*NL*
all
the
big
factories
and
stores
with
the
railroad
depots
,
they
would
*NL*
have
the
teamsters
'
union
by
the
throat
.
Now
and
then
there
were
rumors
*NL*
and
murmurs
in
the
Board
of
Aldermen
,
and
once
there
was
a
committee
to
*NL*
investigate
--
but
each
time
another
small
fortune
was
paid
over
,
and
the
*NL*
rumors
died
away
;
until
at
last
the
city
woke
up
with
a
start
to
find
*NL*
the
work
completed
.
There
was
a
tremendous
scandal
,
of
course
;
it
*NL*
was
found
that
the
city
records
had
been
falsified
and
other
*NL*
crimes
committed
,
and
some
of
Chicago
's
big
capitalists
got
into
*NL*
jail
--
figuratively
speaking
.
The
aldermen
declared
that
they
had
had
no
*NL*
idea
of
it
all
,
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
main
entrance
to
the
work
*NL*
had
been
in
the
rear
of
the
saloon
of
one
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
a
newly
opened
cut
that
Jurgis
worked
,
and
so
he
knew
that
he
*NL*
had
an
all-winter
job
.
He
was
so
rejoiced
that
he
treated
himself
to
a
*NL*
spree
that
night
,
and
with
the
balance
of
his
money
he
hired
himself
*NL*
a
place
in
a
tenement
room
,
where
he
slept
upon
a
big
homemade
straw
*NL*
mattress
along
with
four
other
workingmen
.
This
was
one
dollar
a
week
,
*NL*
and
for
four
more
he
got
his
food
in
a
boardinghouse
near
his
work
.
This
*NL*
would
leave
him
four
dollars
extra
each
week
,
an
unthinkable
sum
for
*NL*
him
.
At
the
outset
he
had
to
pay
for
his
digging
tools
,
and
also
to
buy
*NL*
a
pair
of
heavy
boots
,
since
his
shoes
were
falling
to
pieces
,
and
a
*NL*
flannel
shirt
,
since
the
one
he
had
worn
all
summer
was
in
shreds
.
He
*NL*
spent
a
week
meditating
whether
or
not
he
should
also
buy
an
overcoat
.
*NL*
There
was
one
belonging
to
a
Hebrew
collar
button
peddler
,
who
had
died
*NL*
in
the
room
next
to
him
,
and
which
the
landlady
was
holding
for
her
*NL*
rent
;
in
the
end
,
however
,
Jurgis
decided
to
do
without
it
,
as
he
was
to
*NL*
be
underground
by
day
and
in
bed
at
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
an
unfortunate
decision
,
however
,
for
it
drove
him
more
quickly
*NL*
than
ever
into
the
saloons
.
From
now
on
Jurgis
worked
from
seven
o'clock
*NL*
until
half-past
five
,
with
half
an
hour
for
dinner
;
which
meant
that
he
*NL*
never
saw
the
sunlight
on
weekdays
.
In
the
evenings
there
was
no
place
*NL*
for
him
to
go
except
a
barroom
;
no
place
where
there
was
light
and
*NL*
warmth
,
where
he
could
hear
a
little
music
or
sit
with
a
companion
*NL*
and
talk
.
He
had
now
no
home
to
go
to
;
he
had
no
affection
left
in
his
*NL*
life
--
only
the
pitiful
mockery
of
it
in
the
camaraderie
of
vice
.
On
*NL*
Sundays
the
churches
were
open
--
but
where
was
there
a
church
in
which
an
*NL*
ill-smelling
workingman
,
with
vermin
crawling
upon
his
neck
,
could
sit
*NL*
without
seeing
people
edge
away
and
look
annoyed
?
He
had
,
of
course
,
*NL*
his
corner
in
a
close
though
unheated
room
,
with
a
window
opening
upon
*NL*
a
blank
wall
two
feet
away
;
and
also
he
had
the
bare
streets
,
with
*NL*
the
winter
gales
sweeping
through
them
;
besides
this
he
had
only
the
*NL*
saloons
--
and
,
of
course
,
he
had
to
drink
to
stay
in
them
.
If
he
drank
*NL*
now
and
then
he
was
free
to
make
himself
at
home
,
to
gamble
with
dice
or
*NL*
a
pack
of
greasy
cards
,
to
play
at
a
dingy
pool
table
for
money
,
or
to
*NL*
look
at
a
beer-stained
pink
``
sporting
paper
,
''
with
pictures
of
murderers
*NL*
and
half-naked
women
.
It
was
for
such
pleasures
as
these
that
he
spent
*NL*
his
money
;
and
such
was
his
life
during
the
six
weeks
and
a
half
that
he
*NL*
toiled
for
the
merchants
of
Chicago
,
to
enable
them
to
break
the
grip
of
*NL*
their
teamsters
'
union
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
work
thus
carried
out
,
not
much
thought
was
given
to
the
welfare
of
*NL*
the
laborers
.
On
an
average
,
the
tunneling
cost
a
life
a
day
and
several
*NL*
manglings
;
it
was
seldom
,
however
,
that
more
than
a
dozen
or
two
men
*NL*
heard
of
any
one
accident
.
The
work
was
all
done
by
the
new
boring
*NL*
machinery
,
with
as
little
blasting
as
possible
;
but
there
would
be
*NL*
falling
rocks
and
crushed
supports
,
and
premature
explosions
--
and
in
*NL*
addition
all
the
dangers
of
railroading
.
So
it
was
that
one
night
,
as
*NL*
Jurgis
was
on
his
way
out
with
his
gang
,
an
engine
and
a
loaded
car
*NL*
dashed
round
one
of
the
innumerable
right-angle
branches
and
struck
him
*NL*
upon
the
shoulder
,
hurling
him
against
the
concrete
wall
and
knocking
*NL*
him
senseless
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
opened
his
eyes
again
it
was
to
the
clanging
of
the
bell
of
*NL*
an
ambulance
.
He
was
lying
in
it
,
covered
by
a
blanket
,
and
it
was
*NL*
threading
its
way
slowly
through
the
holiday-shopping
crowds
.
They
took
*NL*
him
to
the
county
hospital
,
where
a
young
surgeon
set
his
arm
;
then
he
*NL*
was
washed
and
laid
upon
a
bed
in
a
ward
with
a
score
or
two
more
of
*NL*
maimed
and
mangled
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
spent
his
Christmas
in
this
hospital
,
and
it
was
the
pleasantest
*NL*
Christmas
he
had
had
in
America
.
Every
year
there
were
scandals
and
*NL*
investigations
in
this
institution
,
the
newspapers
charging
that
doctors
*NL*
were
allowed
to
try
fantastic
experiments
upon
the
patients
;
but
Jurgis
*NL*
knew
nothing
of
this
--
his
only
complaint
was
that
they
used
to
feed
him
*NL*
upon
tinned
meat
,
which
no
man
who
had
ever
worked
in
Packingtown
would
*NL*
feed
to
his
dog
.
Jurgis
had
often
wondered
just
who
ate
the
canned
*NL*
corned
beef
and
``
roast
beef
''
of
the
stockyards
;
now
he
began
to
*NL*
understand
--
that
it
was
what
you
might
call
``
graft
meat
,

*NL*

officials
and

and

*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
was
ready
to
leave
the
hospital
at
the
end
of
two
weeks
.
This
*NL*
did
not
mean
that
his
arm
was
strong
and
that
he
was
able
to
go
back
to
*NL*
work
,
but
simply
that
he
could
get
along
without
further
attention
,
and
*NL*
that
his
place
was
needed
for
some
one
worse
off
than
he
.
That
he
was
*NL*
utterly
helpless
,
and
had
no
means
of
keeping
himself
alive
in
the
*NL*
meantime
,
was
something
which
did
not
concern
the
hospital
authorities
,
*NL*
nor
any
one
else
in
the
city
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
it
chanced
,
he
had
been
hurt
on
a
Monday
,
and
had
just
paid
for
his
*NL*
last
week
's
board
and
his
room
rent
,
and
spent
nearly
all
the
balance
of
*NL*
his
Saturday
's
pay
.
He
had
less
than
seventy-five
cents
in
his
pockets
,
*NL*
and
a
dollar
and
a
half
due
him
for
the
day
's
work
he
had
done
before
he
*NL*
was
hurt
.
He
might
possibly
have
sued
the
company
,
and
got
some
damages
*NL*
for
his
injuries
,
but
he
did
not
know
this
,
and
it
was
not
the
company
's
*NL*
business
to
tell
him
.
He
went
and
got
his
pay
and
his
tools
,
which
he
*NL*
left
in
a
pawnshop
for
fifty
cents
.
Then
he
went
to
his
landlady
,
*NL*
who
had
rented
his
place
and
had
no
other
for
him
;
and
then
to
his
*NL*
boardinghouse
keeper
,
who
looked
him
over
and
questioned
him
.
As
he
must
*NL*
certainly
be
helpless
for
a
couple
of
months
,
and
had
boarded
there
only
*NL*
six
weeks
,
she
decided
very
quickly
that
it
would
not
be
worth
the
risk
*NL*
to
keep
him
on
trust
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
Jurgis
went
out
into
the
streets
,
in
a
most
dreadful
plight
.
It
was
*NL*
bitterly
cold
,
and
a
heavy
snow
was
falling
,
beating
into
his
face
.
*NL*
He
had
no
overcoat
,
and
no
place
to
go
,
and
two
dollars
and
sixty-five
*NL*
cents
in
his
pocket
,
with
the
certainty
that
he
could
not
earn
another
*NL*
cent
for
months
.
The
snow
meant
no
chance
to
him
now
;
he
must
walk
along
*NL*
and
see
others
shoveling
,
vigorous
and
active
--
and
he
with
his
left
arm
*NL*
bound
to
his
side
!
He
could
not
hope
to
tide
himself
over
by
odd
jobs
*NL*
of
loading
trucks
;
he
could
not
even
sell
newspapers
or
carry
satchels
,
*NL*
because
he
was
now
at
the
mercy
of
any
rival
.
Words
could
not
paint
the
*NL*
terror
that
came
over
him
as
he
realized
all
this
.
He
was
like
a
wounded
*NL*
animal
in
the
forest
;
he
was
forced
to
compete
with
his
enemies
upon
*NL*
unequal
terms
.
There
would
be
no
consideration
for
him
because
of
his
*NL*
weakness
--
it
was
no
one
's
business
to
help
him
in
such
distress
,
to
make
*NL*
the
fight
the
least
bit
easier
for
him
.
Even
if
he
took
to
begging
,
he
*NL*
would
be
at
a
disadvantage
,
for
reasons
which
he
was
to
discover
in
good
*NL*
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
beginning
he
could
not
think
of
anything
except
getting
out
of
*NL*
the
awful
cold
.
He
went
into
one
of
the
saloons
he
had
been
wont
to
*NL*
frequent
and
bought
a
drink
,
and
then
stood
by
the
fire
shivering
and
*NL*
waiting
to
be
ordered
out
.
According
to
an
unwritten
law
,
the
buying
a
*NL*
drink
included
the
privilege
of
loafing
for
just
so
long
;
then
one
*NL*
had
to
buy
another
drink
or
move
on
.
That
Jurgis
was
an
old
customer
*NL*
entitled
him
to
a
somewhat
longer
stop
;
but
then
he
had
been
away
two
*NL*
weeks
,
and
was
evidently
``
on
the
bum
.
''
He
might
plead
and
tell
his
``
hard
*NL*
luck
story
,
''
but
that
would
not
help
him
much
;
a
saloon-keeper
who
was
*NL*
to
be
moved
by
such
means
would
soon
have
his
place
jammed
to
the
doors
*NL*
with
``
hoboes
''
on
a
day
like
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
Jurgis
went
out
into
another
place
,
and
paid
another
nickel
.
He
*NL*
was
so
hungry
this
time
that
he
could
not
resist
the
hot
beef
stew
,
an
*NL*
indulgence
which
cut
short
his
stay
by
a
considerable
time
.
When
he
was
*NL*
again
told
to
move
on
,
he
made
his
way
to
a
``
tough
''
place
in
the
*NL*
``
Levee
''
district
,
where
now
and
then
he
had
gone
with
a
certain
rat-eyed
*NL*
Bohemian
workingman
of
his
acquaintance
,
seeking
a
woman
.
It
was
*NL*
Jurgis
's
vain
hope
that
here
the
proprietor
would
let
him
remain
as
a
*NL*
``
sitter
.
''
In
low-class
places
,
in
the
dead
of
winter
,
saloon-keepers
*NL*
would
often
allow
one
or
two
forlorn-looking
bums
who
came
in
covered
*NL*
with
snow
or
soaked
with
rain
to
sit
by
the
fire
and
look
miserable
to
*NL*
attract
custom
.
A
workingman
would
come
in
,
feeling
cheerful
after
his
*NL*
day
's
work
was
over
,
and
it
would
trouble
him
to
have
to
take
his
glass
*NL*
with
such
a
sight
under
his
nose
;
and
so
he
would
call
out
:
``
Hello
,
Bub
,
*NL*
what
's
the
matter
?
You
look
as
if
you
'd
been
up
against
it
!
''
And
then
*NL*
the
other
would
begin
to
pour
out
some
tale
of
misery
,
and
the
man
would
*NL*
say
,
``
Come
have
a
glass
,
and
maybe
that
'll
brace
you
up
.
''
And
so
*NL*
they
would
drink
together
,
and
if
the
tramp
was
sufficiently
*NL*
wretched-looking
,
or
good
enough
at
the
``
gab
,
''
they
might
have
two
;
and
*NL*
if
they
were
to
discover
that
they
were
from
the
same
country
,
or
had
*NL*
lived
in
the
same
city
or
worked
at
the
same
trade
,
they
might
sit
down
*NL*
at
a
table
and
spend
an
hour
or
two
in
talk
--
and
before
they
got
through
*NL*
the
saloon-keeper
would
have
taken
in
a
dollar
.
All
of
this
might
seem
*NL*
diabolical
,
but
the
saloon-keeper
was
in
no
wise
to
blame
for
it
.
He
*NL*
was
in
the
same
plight
as
the
manufacturer
who
has
to
adulterate
and
*NL*
misrepresent
his
product
.
If
he
does
not
,
some
one
else
will
;
and
the
*NL*
saloon-keeper
,
unless
he
is
also
an
alderman
,
is
apt
to
be
in
debt
to
*NL*
the
big
brewers
,
and
on
the
verge
of
being
sold
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
market
for
``
sitters
''
was
glutted
that
afternoon
,
however
,
and
there
*NL*
was
no
place
for
Jurgis
.
In
all
he
had
to
spend
six
nickels
in
keeping
a
*NL*
shelter
over
him
that
frightful
day
,
and
then
it
was
just
dark
,
and
*NL*
the
station
houses
would
not
open
until
midnight
!
At
the
last
place
,
*NL*
however
,
there
was
a
bartender
who
knew
him
and
liked
him
,
and
let
him
*NL*
doze
at
one
of
the
tables
until
the
boss
came
back
;
and
also
,
as
he
*NL*
was
going
out
,
the
man
gave
him
a
tip
--
on
the
next
block
there
was
a
*NL*
religious
revival
of
some
sort
,
with
preaching
and
singing
,
and
hundreds
*NL*
of
hoboes
would
go
there
for
the
shelter
and
warmth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
went
straightway
,
and
saw
a
sign
hung
out
,
saying
that
the
door
*NL*
would
open
at
seven-thirty
;
then
he
walked
,
or
half
ran
,
a
block
,
and
*NL*
hid
awhile
in
a
doorway
and
then
ran
again
,
and
so
on
until
the
hour
.
*NL*
At
the
end
he
was
all
but
frozen
,
and
fought
his
way
in
with
the
rest
of
*NL*
the
throng
-LRB-
at
the
risk
of
having
his
arm
broken
again
-RRB-
,
and
got
close
*NL*
to
the
big
stove
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
eight
o'clock
the
place
was
so
crowded
that
the
speakers
ought
to
*NL*
have
been
flattered
;
the
aisles
were
filled
halfway
up
,
and
at
the
door
*NL*
men
were
packed
tight
enough
to
walk
upon
.
There
were
three
elderly
*NL*
gentlemen
in
black
upon
the
platform
,
and
a
young
lady
who
played
the
*NL*
piano
in
front
.
First
they
sang
a
hymn
,
and
then
one
of
the
three
,
a
*NL*
tall
,
smooth-shaven
man
,
very
thin
,
and
wearing
black
spectacles
,
began
*NL*
an
address
.
Jurgis
heard
smatterings
of
it
,
for
the
reason
that
terror
*NL*
kept
him
awake
--
he
knew
that
he
snored
abominably
,
and
to
have
been
put
*NL*
out
just
then
would
have
been
like
a
sentence
of
death
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
evangelist
was
preaching
``
sin
and
redemption
,
''
the
infinite
grace
of
*NL*
God
and
His
pardon
for
human
frailty
.
He
was
very
much
in
earnest
,
and
*NL*
he
meant
well
,
but
Jurgis
,
as
he
listened
,
found
his
soul
filled
with
*NL*
hatred
.
What
did
he
know
about
sin
and
suffering
--
with
his
smooth
,
black
*NL*
coat
and
his
neatly
starched
collar
,
his
body
warm
,
and
his
belly
full
,
*NL*
and
money
in
his
pocket
--
and
lecturing
men
who
were
struggling
for
their
*NL*
lives
,
men
at
the
death
grapple
with
the
demon
powers
of
hunger
and
*NL*
cold
!
--
This
,
of
course
,
was
unfair
;
but
Jurgis
felt
that
these
men
were
*NL*
out
of
touch
with
the
life
they
discussed
,
that
they
were
unfitted
to
*NL*
solve
its
problems
;
nay
,
they
themselves
were
part
of
the
problem
--
they
*NL*
were
part
of
the
order
established
that
was
crushing
men
down
and
*NL*
beating
them
!
They
were
of
the
triumphant
and
insolent
possessors
;
they
*NL*
had
a
hall
,
and
a
fire
,
and
food
and
clothing
and
money
,
and
so
they
*NL*
might
preach
to
hungry
men
,
and
the
hungry
men
must
be
humble
and
*NL*
listen
!
They
were
trying
to
save
their
souls
--
and
who
but
a
fool
could
*NL*
fail
to
see
that
all
that
was
the
matter
with
their
souls
was
that
they
*NL*
had
not
been
able
to
get
a
decent
existence
for
their
bodies
?
*NL*
*NL*
At
eleven
the
meeting
closed
,
and
the
desolate
audience
filed
out
into
*NL*
the
snow
,
muttering
curses
upon
the
few
traitors
who
had
got
repentance
*NL*
and
gone
up
on
the
platform
.
It
was
yet
an
hour
before
the
station
*NL*
house
would
open
,
and
Jurgis
had
no
overcoat
--
and
was
weak
from
a
long
*NL*
illness
.
During
that
hour
he
nearly
perished
.
He
was
obliged
to
run
hard
*NL*
to
keep
his
blood
moving
at
all
--
and
then
he
came
back
to
the
station
*NL*
house
and
found
a
crowd
blocking
the
street
before
the
door
!
This
was
in
*NL*
the
month
of
January
,
1904
,
when
the
country
was
on
the
verge
of
``
hard
*NL*
times
,
''
and
the
newspapers
were
reporting
the
shutting
down
of
factories
*NL*
every
day
--
it
was
estimated
that
a
million
and
a
half
men
were
thrown
*NL*
out
of
work
before
the
spring
.
So
all
the
hiding
places
of
the
city
were
*NL*
crowded
,
and
before
that
station
house
door
men
fought
and
tore
each
*NL*
other
like
savage
beasts
.
When
at
last
the
place
was
jammed
and
they
*NL*
shut
the
doors
,
half
the
crowd
was
still
outside
;
and
Jurgis
,
with
his
*NL*
helpless
arm
,
was
among
them
.
There
was
no
choice
then
but
to
go
to
a
*NL*
lodging-house
and
spend
another
dime
.
It
really
broke
his
heart
to
do
*NL*
this
,
at
half-past
twelve
o'clock
,
after
he
had
wasted
the
night
at
the
*NL*
meeting
and
on
the
street
.
He
would
be
turned
out
of
the
lodging-house
*NL*
promptly
at
seven
--
they
had
the
shelves
which
served
as
bunks
so
*NL*
contrived
that
they
could
be
dropped
,
and
any
man
who
was
slow
about
*NL*
obeying
orders
could
be
tumbled
to
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
one
day
,
and
the
cold
spell
lasted
for
fourteen
of
them
.
At
the
*NL*
end
of
six
days
every
cent
of
Jurgis
'
money
was
gone
;
and
then
he
went
*NL*
out
on
the
streets
to
beg
for
his
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
would
begin
as
soon
as
the
business
of
the
city
was
moving
.
He
would
*NL*
sally
forth
from
a
saloon
,
and
,
after
making
sure
there
was
no
policeman
*NL*
in
sight
,
would
approach
every
likely-looking
person
who
passed
him
,
*NL*
telling
his
woeful
story
and
pleading
for
a
nickel
or
a
dime
.
Then
when
*NL*
he
got
one
,
he
would
dart
round
the
corner
and
return
to
his
base
to
get
*NL*
warm
;
and
his
victim
,
seeing
him
do
this
,
would
go
away
,
vowing
that
he
*NL*
would
never
give
a
cent
to
a
beggar
again
.
The
victim
never
paused
to
*NL*
ask
where
else
Jurgis
could
have
gone
under
the
circumstances
--
where
*NL*
he
,
the
victim
,
would
have
gone
.
At
the
saloon
Jurgis
could
not
only
get
*NL*
more
food
and
better
food
than
he
could
buy
in
any
restaurant
for
the
*NL*
same
money
,
but
a
drink
in
the
bargain
to
warm
him
up
.
Also
he
could
*NL*
find
a
comfortable
seat
by
a
fire
,
and
could
chat
with
a
companion
until
*NL*
he
was
as
warm
as
toast
.
At
the
saloon
,
too
,
he
felt
at
home
.
Part
of
*NL*
the
saloon-keeper
's
business
was
to
offer
a
home
and
refreshments
to
*NL*
beggars
in
exchange
for
the
proceeds
of
their
foragings
;
and
was
there
*NL*
any
one
else
in
the
whole
city
who
would
do
this
--
would
the
victim
have
*NL*
done
it
himself
?
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Jurgis
might
have
been
expected
to
make
a
successful
beggar
.
He
*NL*
was
just
out
of
the
hospital
,
and
desperately
sick-looking
,
and
with
*NL*
a
helpless
arm
;
also
he
had
no
overcoat
,
and
shivered
pitifully
.
But
,
*NL*
alas
,
it
was
again
the
case
of
the
honest
merchant
,
who
finds
that
the
*NL*
genuine
and
unadulterated
article
is
driven
to
the
wall
by
the
artistic
*NL*
counterfeit
.
Jurgis
,
as
a
beggar
,
was
simply
a
blundering
amateur
in
*NL*
competition
with
organized
and
scientific
professionalism
.
He
was
just
*NL*
out
of
the
hospital
--
but
the
story
was
worn
threadbare
,
and
how
could
*NL*
he
prove
it
?
He
had
his
arm
in
a
sling
--
and
it
was
a
device
a
regular
*NL*
beggar
's
little
boy
would
have
scorned
.
He
was
pale
and
shivering
--
but
*NL*
they
were
made
up
with
cosmetics
,
and
had
studied
the
art
of
chattering
*NL*
their
teeth
.
As
to
his
being
without
an
overcoat
,
among
them
you
would
*NL*
meet
men
you
could
swear
had
on
nothing
but
a
ragged
linen
duster
and
*NL*
a
pair
of
cotton
trousers
--
so
cleverly
had
they
concealed
the
several
*NL*
suits
of
all-wool
underwear
beneath
.
Many
of
these
professional
*NL*
mendicants
had
comfortable
homes
,
and
families
,
and
thousands
of
dollars
*NL*
in
the
bank
;
some
of
them
had
retired
upon
their
earnings
,
and
gone
into
*NL*
the
business
of
fitting
out
and
doctoring
others
,
or
working
children
*NL*
at
the
trade
.
There
were
some
who
had
both
their
arms
bound
tightly
to
*NL*
their
sides
,
and
padded
stumps
in
their
sleeves
,
and
a
sick
child
hired
*NL*
to
carry
a
cup
for
them
.
There
were
some
who
had
no
legs
,
and
pushed
*NL*
themselves
upon
a
wheeled
platform
--
some
who
had
been
favored
with
*NL*
blindness
,
and
were
led
by
pretty
little
dogs
.
Some
less
fortunate
had
*NL*
mutilated
themselves
or
burned
themselves
,
or
had
brought
horrible
sores
*NL*
upon
themselves
with
chemicals
;
you
might
suddenly
encounter
upon
the
*NL*
street
a
man
holding
out
to
you
a
finger
rotting
and
discolored
with
*NL*
gangrene
--
or
one
with
livid
scarlet
wounds
half
escaped
from
their
*NL*
filthy
bandages
.
These
desperate
ones
were
the
dregs
of
the
city
's
*NL*
cesspools
,
wretches
who
hid
at
night
in
the
rain-soaked
cellars
of
*NL*
old
ramshackle
tenements
,
in
``
stale-beer
dives
''
and
opium
joints
,
with
*NL*
abandoned
women
in
the
last
stages
of
the
harlot
's
progress
--
women
who
*NL*
had
been
kept
by
Chinamen
and
turned
away
at
last
to
die
.
Every
day
*NL*
the
police
net
would
drag
hundreds
of
them
off
the
streets
,
and
in
the
*NL*
detention
hospital
you
might
see
them
,
herded
together
in
a
miniature
*NL*
inferno
,
with
hideous
,
beastly
faces
,
bloated
and
leprous
with
disease
,
*NL*
laughing
,
shouting
,
screaming
in
all
stages
of
drunkenness
,
barking
like
*NL*
dogs
,
gibbering
like
apes
,
raving
and
tearing
themselves
in
delirium
.

Chapter
24
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
face
of
all
his
handicaps
,
Jurgis
was
obliged
to
make
the
*NL*
price
of
a
lodging
,
and
of
a
drink
every
hour
or
two
,
under
penalty
of
*NL*
freezing
to
death
.
Day
after
day
he
roamed
about
in
the
arctic
cold
,
*NL*
his
soul
filled
full
of
bitterness
and
despair
.
He
saw
the
world
of
*NL*
civilization
then
more
plainly
than
ever
he
had
seen
it
before
;
a
world
*NL*
in
which
nothing
counted
but
brutal
might
,
an
order
devised
by
those
who
*NL*
possessed
it
for
the
subjugation
of
those
who
did
not
.
He
was
one
of
*NL*
the
latter
;
and
all
outdoors
,
all
life
,
was
to
him
one
colossal
prison
,
*NL*
which
he
paced
like
a
pent-up
tiger
,
trying
one
bar
after
another
,
and
*NL*
finding
them
all
beyond
his
power
.
He
had
lost
in
the
fierce
battle
of
*NL*
greed
,
and
so
was
doomed
to
be
exterminated
;
and
all
society
was
busied
*NL*
to
see
that
he
did
not
escape
the
sentence
.
Everywhere
that
he
turned
*NL*
were
prison
bars
,
and
hostile
eyes
following
him
;
the
well-fed
,
sleek
*NL*
policemen
,
from
whose
glances
he
shrank
,
and
who
seemed
to
grip
their
*NL*
clubs
more
tightly
when
they
saw
him
;
the
saloon-keepers
,
who
never
*NL*
ceased
to
watch
him
while
he
was
in
their
places
,
who
were
jealous
*NL*
of
every
moment
he
lingered
after
he
had
paid
his
money
;
the
hurrying
*NL*
throngs
upon
the
streets
,
who
were
deaf
to
his
entreaties
,
oblivious
of
*NL*
his
very
existence
--
and
savage
and
contemptuous
when
he
forced
himself
*NL*
upon
them
.
They
had
their
own
affairs
,
and
there
was
no
place
for
him
*NL*
among
them
.
There
was
no
place
for
him
anywhere
--
every
direction
he
*NL*
turned
his
gaze
,
this
fact
was
forced
upon
him
:
Everything
was
built
*NL*
to
express
it
to
him
:
the
residences
,
with
their
heavy
walls
and
bolted
*NL*
doors
,
and
basement
windows
barred
with
iron
;
the
great
warehouses
*NL*
filled
with
the
products
of
the
whole
world
,
and
guarded
by
iron
*NL*
shutters
and
heavy
gates
;
the
banks
with
their
unthinkable
billions
of
*NL*
wealth
,
all
buried
in
safes
and
vaults
of
steel
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
one
day
there
befell
Jurgis
the
one
adventure
of
his
life
.
It
*NL*
was
late
at
night
,
and
he
had
failed
to
get
the
price
of
a
lodging
.
Snow
*NL*
was
falling
,
and
he
had
been
out
so
long
that
he
was
covered
with
it
,
*NL*
and
was
chilled
to
the
bone
.
He
was
working
among
the
theater
crowds
,
*NL*
flitting
here
and
there
,
taking
large
chances
with
the
police
,
in
his
*NL*
desperation
half
hoping
to
be
arrested
.
When
he
saw
a
blue-coat
start
*NL*
toward
him
,
however
,
his
heart
failed
him
,
and
he
dashed
down
a
side
*NL*
street
and
fled
a
couple
of
blocks
.
When
he
stopped
again
he
saw
a
man
*NL*
coming
toward
him
,
and
placed
himself
in
his
path
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
,
sir
,
''
he
began
,
in
the
usual
formula
,
``
will
you
give
me
the
*NL*
price
of
a
lodging
?
I
've
had
a
broken
arm
,
and
I
ca
n't
work
,
and
I
've
*NL*
not
a
cent
in
my
pocket
.
I
'm
an
honest
working-man
,
sir
,
and
I
never
*NL*
begged
before
!
It
's
not
my
fault
,
sir
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
usually
went
on
until
he
was
interrupted
,
but
this
man
did
not
*NL*
interrupt
,
and
so
at
last
he
came
to
a
breathless
stop
.
The
other
had
*NL*
halted
,
and
Jurgis
suddenly
noticed
that
he
stood
a
little
unsteadily
.
*NL*
``
Whuzzat
you
say
?
''
he
queried
suddenly
,
in
a
thick
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
began
again
,
speaking
more
slowly
and
distinctly
;
before
he
was
*NL*
half
through
the
other
put
out
his
hand
and
rested
it
upon
his
shoulder
.
*NL*
``
Poor
ole
chappie
!
''
he
said
.
``
Been
up
--
hic
--
up
--
against
it
,
hey
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
lurched
toward
Jurgis
,
and
the
hand
upon
his
shoulder
became
an
*NL*
arm
about
his
neck
.
``
Up
against
it
myself
,
ole
sport
,
''
he
said
.
``
She
's
a
*NL*
hard
ole
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
close
to
a
lamppost
,
and
Jurgis
got
a
glimpse
of
the
other
.
He
*NL*
was
a
young
fellow
--
not
much
over
eighteen
,
with
a
handsome
boyish
face
.
*NL*
He
wore
a
silk
hat
and
a
rich
soft
overcoat
with
a
fur
collar
;
and
he
*NL*
smiled
at
Jurgis
with
benignant
sympathy
.
``
I
'm
hard
up
,
too
,
my
*NL*
goo
'
fren
'
,
''
he
said
.
``

or

*NL*
*NL*
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
``

exclaimed
the
young
fellow
,
still
smiling
sweetly
,
``

*NL*

Jurgis
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So

said
the

,
sympathetically
.
``

This

was
a
song

and
the
young
gentleman
's
voice
rose
mournful
*NL*
and
wailing
,
while
he
swung
upon
Jurgis

The

was
glancing

about
nervously

They
had
started
down
the
street
,
arm
in
arm
,
the
young
man
pushing
*NL*
Jurgis
along
,
half
dazed
.
Jurgis
was
trying
to
think
what
to
do
--
he
knew
*NL*
he
could
not
pass
any
crowded
place
with
his
new
acquaintance
without
*NL*
attracting
attention
and
being
stopped
.
It
was
only
because
of
the
*NL*
falling
snow
that
people
who
passed
here
did
not
notice
anything
wrong
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
,
therefore
,
Jurgis
stopped
.
``
Is

far

he
inquired

*NL*

the

,
``

Well
,
we
'll
*NL*
ride
--
whatcha
say
?
Good
!
Call
a
cab

''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
,
gripping
Jurgis
tight
with
one
hand
,
the
young
fellow
began
*NL*
searching
his
pockets
with
the
other
.
``
You
call
,
ole
sport
,
an
'
I
'll
*NL*
pay
,
''
he
suggested
.
``
How
's
that
,
hey
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
pulled
out
from
somewhere
a
big
roll
of
bills
.
It
was
more
money
*NL*
than
Jurgis
had
ever
seen
in
his
life
before
,
and
he
stared
at
it
with
*NL*
startled
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Looks
like
a
lot
,
hey
?
''
said
Master
Freddie
,
fumbling
with
it
.
``
Fool
*NL*

,
though
,

they
're
all

I
'll

Nuff

''
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
fashion
the
young
gentleman
continued
to
prattle
on
--
and
*NL*
meantime
Jurgis
was
trembling
with
excitement
.
He
might
grab
that
wad
of
*NL*
bills
and
be
out
of
sight
in
the
darkness
before
the
other
could
collect
*NL*
his
wits
.
Should
he
do
it
?
What
better
had
he
to
hope
for
,
if
he
waited
*NL*
longer
?
But
Jurgis
had
never
committed
a
crime
in
his
life
,
and
now
he
*NL*
hesitated
half
a
second
too
long
.
``
Freddie
''
got
one
bill
loose
,
and
then
*NL*
stuffed
the
rest
back
into
his
trousers
'
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
ole
man
,
''
he
said
,
``
you
take
it
.
''
He
held
it
out
fluttering
.
They
*NL*
were
in
front
of
a
saloon
;
and
by
the
light
of
the
window
Jurgis
saw
*NL*
that
it
was
a
hundred-dollar
bill
!
``
You
take
it
,
''
the
other
repeated
.
*NL*
``
Pay

keep

An

so
he
set
Aunt
Polly
to
*NL*

off

''
*NL*
*NL*
A
cab
was
driving
by
;
and
Jurgis
sprang
and
called
,
and
it
swung
round
*NL*
to
the
curb
.
Master
Freddie
clambered
in
with
some
difficulty
,
and
*NL*
Jurgis
had
started
to
follow
,
when
the
driver
shouted
:
``
Hi
,
there
!
Get
*NL*
out
--
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
hesitated
,
and
was
half
obeying
;
but
his
companion
broke
out
:
*NL*
``
Whuzzat
?
Whuzzamatter
wiz
you
,
hey
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
cabbie
subsided
,
and
Jurgis
climbed
in
.
Then
Freddie
gave
a
*NL*
number
on
the
Lake
Shore
Drive
,
and
the
carriage
started
away
.
The
*NL*
youngster
leaned
back
and
snuggled
up
to
Jurgis
,
murmuring
contentedly
;
*NL*
in
half
a
minute
he
was
sound
asleep
,
Jurgis
sat
shivering
,
speculating
*NL*
as
to
whether
he
might
not
still
be
able
to
get
hold
of
the
roll
of
*NL*
bills
.
He
was
afraid
to
try
to
go
through
his
companion
's
pockets
,
*NL*
however
;
and
besides
the
cabbie
might
be
on
the
watch
.
He
had
the
*NL*
hundred
safe
,
and
he
would
have
to
be
content
with
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
end
of
half
an
hour
or
so
the
cab
stopped
.
They
were
out
on
*NL*
the
waterfront
,
and
from
the
east
a
freezing
gale
was
blowing
off
the
*NL*
ice-bound
lake
.
``
Here
we
are
,
''
called
the
cabbie
,
and
Jurgis
awakened
*NL*
his
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Master
Freddie
sat
up
with
a
start
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hello
!
''
he
said
.
``
Where
are
we
?
Whuzzis
?
Who
are
you

hey
?
Oh
,
yes
,
*NL*

*NL*
so

''
*NL*
*NL*
Before
them
there
loomed
an
enormous
granite
pile
,
set
far
back
from
the
*NL*
street
,
and
occupying
a
whole
block
.
By
the
light
of
the
driveway
lamps
*NL*
Jurgis
could
see
that
it
had
towers
and
huge
gables
,
like
a
medieval
*NL*
castle
.
He
thought
that
the
young
fellow
must
have
made
a
mistake
--
it
*NL*
was
inconceivable
to
him
that
any
person
could
have
a
home
like
a
hotel
*NL*
or
the
city
hall
.
But
he
followed
in
silence
,
and
they
went
up
the
long
*NL*
flight
of
steps
,
arm
in
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
a
button
here
,
ole
sport
,
''
said
Master
Freddie
.
``
Hole
my
arm
*NL*
while
I
find
her
!
Steady
,
now
--
oh
,
yes
,
here
she
is
!
Saved
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
bell
rang
,
and
in
a
few
seconds
the
door
was
opened
.
A
man
in
blue
*NL*
livery
stood
holding
it
,
and
gazing
before
him
,
silent
as
a
statue
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
stood
for
a
moment
blinking
in
the
light
.
Then
Jurgis
felt
his
*NL*
companion
pulling
,
and
he
stepped
in
,
and
the
blue
automaton
closed
the
*NL*
door
.
Jurgis
's
heart
was
beating
wildly
;
it
was
a
bold
thing
for
him
to
*NL*
do
--
into
what
strange
unearthly
place
he
was
venturing
he
had
no
idea
.
*NL*
Aladdin
entering
his
cave
could
not
have
been
more
excited
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
place
where
he
stood
was
dimly
lighted
;
but
he
could
see
a
vast
*NL*
hall
,
with
pillars
fading
into
the
darkness
above
,
and
a
great
staircase
*NL*
opening
at
the
far
end
of
it
.
The
floor
was
of
tesselated
marble
,
smooth
*NL*
as
glass
,
and
from
the
walls
strange
shapes
loomed
out
,
woven
into
*NL*
huge
portieres
in
rich
,
harmonious
colors
,
or
gleaming
from
paintings
,
*NL*
wonderful
and
mysterious-looking
in
the
half-light
,
purple
and
red
and
*NL*
golden
,
like
sunset
glimmers
in
a
shadowy
forest
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
in
livery
had
moved
silently
toward
them
;
Master
Freddie
took
*NL*
off
his
hat
and
handed
it
to
him
,
and
then
,
letting
go
of
Jurgis
'
*NL*
arm
,
tried
to
get
out
of
his
overcoat
.
After
two
or
three
attempts
he
*NL*
accomplished
this
,
with
the
lackey
's
help
,
and
meantime
a
second
man
had
*NL*
approached
,
a
tall
and
portly
personage
,
solemn
as
an
executioner
.
He
*NL*
bore
straight
down
upon
Jurgis
,
who
shrank
away
nervously
;
he
seized
him
*NL*
by
the
arm
without
a
word
,
and
started
toward
the
door
with
him
.
Then
*NL*
suddenly
came
Master
Freddie
's
voice
,
``
Hamilton
!
My
fren
'
will
remain
*NL*
wiz
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
paused
and
half
released
Jurgis
.
``
Come
`
long
ole
chappie
,
''
said
*NL*
the
other
,
and
Jurgis
started
toward
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Master
Frederick
!
''
exclaimed
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
that
the
cabbie
--
hic
--
is
paid
,
''
was
the
other
's
response
;
and
he
*NL*
linked
his
arm
in
Jurgis
'
.
Jurgis
was
about
to
say
,
``
I
have
the
money
*NL*
for
him
,
''
but
he
restrained
himself
.
The
stout
man
in
uniform
signaled
*NL*
to
the
other
,
who
went
out
to
the
cab
,
while
he
followed
Jurgis
and
his
*NL*
young
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
down
the
great
hall
,
and
then
turned
.
Before
them
were
two
*NL*
huge
doors
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hamilton
,
''
said
Master
Freddie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
?
''
said
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whuzzamatter
wizze
dinin
'
-
room
doors
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
is
the
matter
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
dontcha
openum
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
rolled
them
back
;
another
vista
lost
itself
in
the
darkness
.
*NL*
``
Lights
,
''
commanded
Master
Freddie
;
and
the
butler
pressed
a
button
,
and
*NL*
a
flood
of
brilliant
incandescence
streamed
from
above
,
half-blinding
*NL*
Jurgis
.
He
stared
;
and
little
by
little
he
made
out
the
great
apartment
,
*NL*
with
a
domed
ceiling
from
which
the
light
poured
,
and
walls
that
were
*NL*
one
enormous
painting
--
nymphs
and
dryads
dancing
in
a
flower-strewn
*NL*
glade
--
Diana
with
her
hounds
and
horses
,
dashing
headlong
through
a
*NL*
mountain
streamlet
--
a
group
of
maidens
bathing
in
a
forest
pool
--
all
*NL*
life-size
,
and
so
real
that
Jurgis
thought
that
it
was
some
work
of
*NL*
enchantment
,
that
he
was
in
a
dream
palace
.
Then
his
eye
passed
to
*NL*
the
long
table
in
the
center
of
the
hall
,
a
table
black
as
ebony
,
and
*NL*
gleaming
with
wrought
silver
and
gold
.
In
the
center
of
it
was
a
huge
*NL*
carven
bowl
,
with
the
glistening
gleam
of
ferns
and
the
red
and
purple
*NL*
of
rare
orchids
,
glowing
from
a
light
hidden
somewhere
in
their
midst
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
's
the
dinin
'
room
,
''
observed
Master
Freddie
.
``
How
you
like
it
,
*NL*
hey
,
ole
sport
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
always
insisted
on
having
an
answer
to
his
remarks
,
leaning
over
*NL*
Jurgis
and
smiling
into
his
face
.
Jurgis
liked
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rummy
ole
place
to
feed
in
all
`
lone
,
though
,
''
was
Freddie
's
*NL*
comment
--
``
rummy
's
hell
!
Whuzya
think
,
hey
?
''
Then
another
idea
*NL*
occurred
to
him
and
he
went
on
,
without
waiting
:
``
Maybe
you
never
saw
*NL*
anythin
--
hic
--
like
this
`
fore
?
Hey
,

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

''
said
Jurgis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come

,
maybe
--
hey
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

''
said
Jurgis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
had
started
involuntarily
;
the
other
,
whose
sharp
eyes
missed
*NL*
nothing
,
demanded
:
``
Whuzzamatter
,
hey
?
Heard
of
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Jurgis
managed
to
stammer
out
:
``
I
have
worked
for
him

the
yards
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What

cried
Master

with
a
yell

*NL*
The
stately
butler
bowed
his
head
,
but
made
not
a
sound
;
and
suddenly
*NL*
Master
Freddie
pointed
an
eager
finger
at
him
.
``

*NL*
*NL*
And
the
butler
again
bowed
his
head
.
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
he
said
,
at
which
*NL*
Master
Freddie
hung
tightly
upon
Jurgis
's
neck
and
went
into
a
fit
of
*NL*
laughter
.
``

roared

*NL*
*NL*
The
two
waited
until
his
fit
had
spent
itself
,
to
see
what

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
the
butler
,
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Master
Frederick
drew
himself
up
to
a
stately
height
.
``
My

's
*NL*
orders
were
left
to
me

''
he
said
.
Then
,
clasping
*NL*
Jurgis
tightly
by
the
neck
,
he
staggered
out
of
the
room
;
on
the
way
*NL*
another
idea
occurred
to
him
,
and
he
asked
:
``
Any

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
``

An

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good

''
said
Master
Freddie
;
and
added
fervently
:
``
God
bless
'em
,
the
*NL*
little
lambs
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
up
the
great
staircase
,
one
step
at
a
time
;
at
the
top
of
it
*NL*
there
gleamed
at
them
out
of
the
shadows
the
figure
of
a
nymph
crouching
*NL*
by
a
fountain
,
a
figure
ravishingly
beautiful
,
the
flesh
warm
and
*NL*
glowing
with
the
hues
of
life
.
Above
was
a
huge
court
,
with
domed
roof
,
*NL*
the
various
apartments
opening
into
it
.
The
butler
had
paused
below
but
*NL*
a
few
minutes
to
give
orders
,
and
then
followed
them
;
now
he
pressed
a
*NL*
button
,
and
the
hall
blazed
with
light
.
He
opened
a
door
before
them
,
*NL*
and
then
pressed
another
button
,
as
they
staggered
into
the
apartment
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
fitted
up
as
a
study
.
In
the
center
was
a
mahogany
table
,
covered
*NL*
with
books
,
and
smokers
'
implements
;
the
walls
were
decorated
*NL*
with
college
trophies
and
colors
--
flags
,
posters
,
photographs
and
*NL*
knickknacks
--
tennis
rackets
,
canoe
paddles
,
golf
clubs
,
and
polo
sticks
.
*NL*
An
enormous
moose
head
,
with
horns
six
feet
across
,
faced
a
buffalo
head
*NL*
on
the
opposite
wall
,
while
bear
and
tiger
skins
covered
the
polished
*NL*
floor
.
There
were
lounging
chairs
and
sofas
,
window
seats
covered
with
*NL*
soft
cushions
of
fantastic
designs
;
there
was
one
corner
fitted
in
*NL*
Persian
fashion
,
with
a
huge
canopy
and
a
jeweled
lamp
beneath
.
Beyond
,
*NL*
a
door
opened
upon
a
bedroom
,
and
beyond
that
was
a
swimming
pool
of
the
*NL*
purest
marble
,
that
had
cost
about
forty
thousand
dollars
.
*NL*
*NL*
Master
Freddie
stood
for
a
moment
or
two
,
gazing
about
him
;
then
out
*NL*
of
the
next
room
a
dog
emerged
,
a
monstrous
bulldog
,
the
most
hideous
*NL*
object
that
Jurgis
had
ever
laid
eyes
upon
.
He
yawned
,
opening
a
mouth
*NL*
like
a
dragon
's
;
and
he
came
toward
the
young
man
,
wagging
his
tail
.
*NL*
``
Hello
,
Dewey
!
''
cried
his
master
.
``
Been
havin
'
a

,

Well
,
*NL*
well
--
hello
there
,

''
-LRB-
The
dog
was
snarling
at
Jurgis
.
-RRB-
*NL*
``
Why
,
Dewey
--

How

*NL*
hey
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
speaker
sank
into
one
of
the
big
armchairs
,
and
Admiral
Dewey
*NL*
crouched
beneath
it
;
he
did
not
snarl
again
,
but
he
never
took
his
eyes
*NL*
off
Jurgis
.
He
was
perfectly
sober
,
was
the
Admiral
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
butler
had
closed
the
door
,
and
he
stood
by
it
,
watching
Jurgis
*NL*
every
second
.
Now
there
came
footsteps
outside
,
and
,
as
he
opened
the
*NL*
door
a
man
in
livery
entered
,
carrying
a
folding
table
,
and
behind
him
*NL*
two
men
with
covered
trays
.
They
stood
like
statues
while
the
first
*NL*
spread
the
table
and
set
out
the
contents
of
the
trays
upon
it
.
*NL*
There
were
cold
pates
,
and
thin
slices
of
meat
,
tiny
bread
and
butter
*NL*
sandwiches
with
the
crust
cut
off
,
a
bowl
of
sliced
peaches
and
cream
*NL*
-LRB-
in
January
-RRB-
,
little
fancy
cakes
,
pink
and
green
and
yellow
and
white
,
*NL*
and
half
a
dozen
ice-cold
bottles
of
wine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thass
the
stuff
for
you
!
''
cried
Master
Freddie
,
exultantly
,
as
he
spied
*NL*
them
.
``
Come
`
long
,
ole
chappie
,
move
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
seated
himself
at
the
table
;
the
waiter
pulled
a
cork
,
and
he
*NL*
took
the
bottle
and
poured
three
glasses
of
its
contents
in
succession
*NL*
down
his
throat
.
Then
he
gave
a
long-drawn
sigh
,
and
cried
again
to
*NL*
Jurgis
to
seat
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
butler
held
the
chair
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
,
and
Jurgis
*NL*
thought
it
was
to
keep
him
out
of
it
;
but
finally
he
understand
that
*NL*
it
was
the
other
's
intention
to
put
it
under
him
,
and
so
he
sat
*NL*
down
,
cautiously
and
mistrustingly
.
Master
Freddie
perceived
that
the
*NL*
attendants
embarrassed
him
,
and
he
remarked
with
a
nod
to
them
,
``
You
may
*NL*
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
,
all
save
the
butler
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
go
too
,
Hamilton
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Master
Frederick
--
''
the
man
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
!
''
cried
the
youngster
,
angrily
.
``
Damn
you
,
do
n't
you
hear
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
went
out
and
closed
the
door
;
Jurgis
,
who
was
as
sharp
as
he
,
*NL*
observed
that
he
took
the
key
out
of
the
lock
,
in
order
that
he
might
*NL*
peer
through
the
keyhole
.
*NL*
*NL*
Master
Frederick
turned
to
the
table
again
.
``
Now
,
''
he
said
,
``
go
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
gazed
at
him
doubtingly
.
``
Eat
!
''
cried
the
other
.
``
Pile
in
,
ole
*NL*
chappie
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
want
anything
?
''
Jurgis
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ai
n't
hungry
,
''
was
the
reply
--
``
only
thirsty
.
Kitty
and
me
had
some
*NL*
candy
--
you
go
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
Jurgis
began
,
without
further
parley
.
He
ate
as
with
two
shovels
,
his
*NL*
fork
in
one
hand
and
his
knife
in
the
other
;
when
he
once
got
started
*NL*
his
wolf-hunger
got
the
better
of
him
,
and
he
did
not
stop
for
breath
*NL*
until
he
had
cleared
every
plate
.
``
Gee
whiz
!
''
said
the
other
,
who
had
*NL*
been
watching
him
in
wonder
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
held
Jurgis
the
bottle
.
``
Lessee
you
drink
now
,
''
he
said
;
and
*NL*
Jurgis
took
the
bottle
and
turned
it
up
to
his
mouth
,
and
a
wonderfully
*NL*
unearthly
liquid
ecstasy
poured
down
his
throat
,
tickling
every
nerve
of
*NL*
him
,
thrilling
him
with
joy
.
He
drank
the
very
last
drop
of
it
,
and
then
*NL*
he
gave
vent
to
a
long-drawn
``
Ah
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
stuff
,
hey
?
''
said
Freddie
,
sympathetically
;
he
had
leaned
back
in
*NL*
the
big
chair
,
putting
his
arm
behind
his
head
and
gazing
at
Jurgis
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Jurgis
gazed
back
at
him
.
He
was
clad
in
spotless
evening
dress
,
was
*NL*
Freddie
,
and
looked
very
handsome
--
he
was
a
beautiful
boy
,
with
*NL*
light
golden
hair
and
the
head
of
an
Antinous
.
He
smiled
at
Jurgis
*NL*
confidingly
,
and
then
started
talking
again
,
with
his
blissful
*NL*
insouciance
.
This
time
he
talked
for
ten
minutes
at
a
stretch
,
and
in
*NL*
the
course
of
the
speech
he
told
Jurgis
all
of
his
family
history
.
His
*NL*
big
brother
Charlie
was
in
love
with
the
guileless
maiden
who
played
the
*NL*
part
of
``
Little
Bright-Eyes
''
in
``
The
Kaliph
of
Kamskatka
.
''
He
had
been
*NL*
on
the
verge
of
marrying
her
once
,
only
``
the
guv
`
ner
''
had
sworn
to
*NL*
disinherit
him
,
and
had
presented
him
with
a
sum
that
would
stagger
the
*NL*
imagination
,
and
that
had
staggered
the
virtue
of
``
Little
Bright-Eyes
.
''
*NL*
Now
Charlie
had
got
leave
from
college
,
and
had
gone
away
in
his
*NL*
automobile
on
the
next
best
thing
to
a
honeymoon
.
``
The
guv
`
ner
''
had
made
*NL*
threats
to
disinherit
another
of
his
children
also
,
sister
Gwendolen
,
*NL*
who
had
married
an
Italian
marquis
with
a
string
of
titles
and
a
dueling
*NL*
record
.
They
lived
in
his
chateau
,
or
rather
had
,
until
he
had
taken
to
*NL*
firing
the
breakfast
dishes
at
her
;
then
she
had
cabled
for
help
,
and
*NL*
the
old
gentleman
had
gone
over
to
find
out
what
were
his
Grace
's
terms
.
*NL*
So
they
had
left
Freddie
all
alone
,
and
he
with
less
than
two
thousand
*NL*
dollars
in
his
pocket
.
Freddie
was
up
in
arms
and
meant
serious
*NL*
business
,
as
they
would
find
in
the
end
--
if
there
was
no
other
way
of
*NL*
bringing
them
to
terms
he
would
have
his
``
Kittens
''
wire
that
she
was
*NL*
about
to
marry
him
,
and
see
what
happened
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
cheerful
youngster
rattled
on
,
until
he
was
tired
out
.
He
smiled
*NL*
his
sweetest
smile
at
Jurgis
,
and
then
he
closed
his
eyes
,
sleepily
.
*NL*
Then
he
opened
them
again
,
and
smiled
once
more
,
and
finally
closed
them
*NL*
and
forgot
to
open
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
several
minutes
Jurgis
sat
perfectly
motionless
,
watching
him
,
and
*NL*
reveling
in
the
strange
sensation
of
the
champagne
.
Once
he
stirred
,
*NL*
and
the
dog
growled
;
after
that
he
sat
almost
holding
his
breath
--
until
*NL*
after
a
while
the
door
of
the
room
opened
softly
,
and
the
butler
came
*NL*
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
toward
Jurgis
upon
tiptoe
,
scowling
at
him
;
and
Jurgis
rose
*NL*
up
,
and
retreated
,
scowling
back
.
So
until
he
was
against
the
wall
,
and
*NL*
then
the
butler
came
close
,
and
pointed
toward
the
door
.
``
Get
out
of
*NL*
here
!
''
he
whispered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
hesitated
,
giving
a
glance
at
Freddie
,
who
was
snoring
softly
.
*NL*
``
If
you
do
,
you
son
of
a
--
''
hissed
the
butler
,
``
I
'll
mash
in
your
face
*NL*
for
you
before
you
get
out
of
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Jurgis
wavered
but
an
instant
more
.
He
saw
``
Admiral
Dewey
''
coming
*NL*
up
behind
the
man
and
growling
softly
,
to
back
up
his
threats
.
Then
he
*NL*
surrendered
and
started
toward
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
out
without
a
sound
,
and
down
the
great
echoing
staircase
,
*NL*
and
through
the
dark
hall
.
At
the
front
door
he
paused
,
and
the
butler
*NL*
strode
close
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
up
your
hands
,
''
he
snarled
.
Jurgis
took
a
step
back
,
clinching
his
*NL*
one
well
fist
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
for
?
''
he
cried
;
and
then
understanding
that
the
fellow
proposed
to
*NL*
search
him
,
he
answered
,
``
I
'll
see
you
in
hell
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
want
to
go
to
jail
?
''
demanded
the
butler
,
menacingly
.
``
I
'll
have
*NL*
the
police
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
'em
!
''
roared
Jurgis
,
with
fierce
passion
.
``
But
you
wo
n't
put
*NL*
your
hands
on
me
till
you
do
!
I
have
n't
touched
anything
in
your
damned
*NL*
house
,
and
I
'll
not
have
you
touch
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
butler
,
who
was
terrified
lest
his
young
master
should
waken
,
*NL*
stepped
suddenly
to
the
door
,
and
opened
it
.
``
Get
out
of
here
!
''
he
said
;
*NL*
and
then
as
Jurgis
passed
through
the
opening
,
he
gave
him
a
ferocious
*NL*
kick
that
sent
him
down
the
great
stone
steps
at
a
run
,
and
landed
him
*NL*
sprawling
in
the
snow
at
the
bottom
.

Jurgis

up
,
wild
with
rage
,
but
the
door
was
shut
and
the
great
*NL*
castle
was
dark
and
impregnable
.
Then
the
icy
teeth
of
the
blast
bit
*NL*
into
him
,
and
he
turned
and
went
away
at
a
run
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
stopped
again
it
was
because
he
was
coming
to
frequented
*NL*
streets
and
did
not
wish
to
attract
attention
.
In
spite
of
that
last
*NL*
humiliation
,
his
heart
was
thumping
fast
with
triumph
.
He
had
come
out
*NL*
ahead
on
that
deal
!
He
put
his
hand
into
his
trousers
'
pocket
every
now
*NL*
and
then
,
to
make
sure
that
the
precious
hundred-dollar
bill
was
still
*NL*
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
he
was
in
a
plight
--
a
curious
and
even
dreadful
plight
,
when
he
came
*NL*
to
realize
it
.
He
had
not
a
single
cent
but
that
one
bill
!
And
he
had
to
*NL*
find
some
shelter
that
night
he
had
to
change
it
!
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
spent
half
an
hour
walking
and
debating
the
problem
.
There
was
*NL*
no
one
he
could
go
to
for
help
--
he
had
to
manage
it
all
alone
.
To
get
*NL*
it
changed
in
a
lodging-house
would
be
to
take
his
life
in
his
hands
--
he
*NL*
would
almost
certainly
be
robbed
,
and
perhaps
murdered
,
before
morning
.
*NL*
He
might
go
to
some
hotel
or
railroad
depot
and
ask
to
have
it
changed
;
*NL*
but
what
would
they
think
,
seeing
a
``
bum
''
like
him
with
a
hundred
*NL*
dollars
?
He
would
probably
be
arrested
if
he
tried
it
;
and
what
story
*NL*
could
he
tell
?
On
the
morrow
Freddie
Jones
would
discover
his
loss
,
and
*NL*
there
would
be
a
hunt
for
him
,
and
he
would
lose
his
money
.
The
only
*NL*
other
plan
he
could
think
of
was
to
try
in
a
saloon
.
He
might
pay
them
*NL*
to
change
it
,
if
it
could
not
be
done
otherwise
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
began
peering
into
places
as
he
walked
;
he
passed
several
as
being
*NL*
too
crowded
--
then
finally
,
chancing
upon
one
where
the
bartender
was
all
*NL*
alone
,
he
gripped
his
hands
in
sudden
resolution
and
went
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
change
me
a
hundred-dollar
bill
?
''
he
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bartender
was
a
big
,
husky
fellow
,
with
the
jaw
of
a
prize
fighter
,
*NL*
and
a
three
weeks
'
stubble
of
hair
upon
it
.
He
stared
at
Jurgis
.
``
What
's
*NL*
that
youse
say
?
''
he
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
said
,
could
you
change
me
a
hundred-dollar
bill
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
'd
youse
get
it
?
''
he
inquired
incredulously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
,
''
said
Jurgis
;
``
I
've
got
it
,
and
I
want
it
changed
.
I
'll
pay
*NL*
you
if
you
'll
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
stared
at
him
hard
.
``
Lem
me
see
it
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
change
it
?
''
Jurgis
demanded
,
gripping
it
tightly
in
his
*NL*
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
the
hell
can
I
know
if
it
's
good
or
not
?
''
retorted
the
bartender
.
*NL*
``
Whatcher
take
me
for
,
hey
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Jurgis
slowly
and
warily
approached
him
;
he
took
out
the
bill
,
and
*NL*
fumbled
it
for
a
moment
,
while
the
man
stared
at
him
with
hostile
eyes
*NL*
across
the
counter
.
Then
finally
he
handed
it
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
took
it
,
and
began
to
examine
it
;
he
smoothed
it
between
his
*NL*
fingers
,
and
held
it
up
to
the
light
;
he
turned
it
over
,
and
upside
*NL*
down
,
and
edgeways
.
It
was
new
and
rather
stiff
,
and
that
made
him
*NL*
dubious
.
Jurgis
was
watching
him
like
a
cat
all
the
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Humph
,
''
he
said
,
finally
,
and
gazed
at
the
stranger
,
sizing
him
up
--
a
*NL*
ragged
,
ill-smelling
tramp
,
with
no
overcoat
and
one
arm
in
a
sling
--
and
*NL*
a
hundred-dollar
bill
!
``
Want
to
buy
anything
?
''
he
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Jurgis
,
``
I
'll
take
a
glass
of
beer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
said
the
other
,
``
I
'll
change
it
.
''
And
he
put
the
bill
in
*NL*
his
pocket
,
and
poured
Jurgis
out
a
glass
of
beer
,
and
set
it
on
the
*NL*
counter
.
Then
he
turned
to
the
cash
register
,
and
punched
up
five
cents
,
*NL*
and
began
to
pull
money
out
of
the
drawer
.
Finally
,
he
faced
Jurgis
,
*NL*
counting
it
out
--
two
dimes
,
a
quarter
,
and
fifty
cents
.
``
There
,
''
he
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
second
Jurgis
waited
,
expecting
to
see
him
turn
again
.
``
My
*NL*
ninety-nine
dollars
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
ninety-nine
dollars
?
''
demanded
the
bartender
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
change
!
''
he
cried
--
``
the
rest
of
my
hundred
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
on
,
''
said
the
bartender
,
``
you
're
nutty
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Jurgis
stared
at
him
with
wild
eyes
.
For
an
instant
horror
reigned
*NL*
in
him
--
black
,
paralyzing
,
awful
horror
,
clutching
him
at
the
heart
;
*NL*
and
then
came
rage
,
in
surging
,
blinding
floods
--
he
screamed
aloud
,
and
*NL*
seized
the
glass
and
hurled
it
at
the
other
's
head
.
The
man
ducked
,
and
*NL*
it
missed
him
by
half
an
inch
;
he
rose
again
and
faced
Jurgis
,
who
was
*NL*
vaulting
over
the
bar
with
his
one
well
arm
,
and
dealt
him
a
smashing
*NL*
blow
in
the
face
,
hurling
him
backward
upon
the
floor
.
Then
,
as
Jurgis
*NL*
scrambled
to
his
feet
again
and
started
round
the
counter
after
him
,
he
*NL*
shouted
at
the
top
of
his
voice
,
``
Help
!
help
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
seized
a
bottle
off
the
counter
as
he
ran
;
and
as
the
bartender
*NL*
made
a
leap
he
hurled
the
missile
at
him
with
all
his
force
.
It
just
*NL*
grazed
his
head
,
and
shivered
into
a
thousand
pieces
against
the
post
*NL*
of
the
door
.
Then
Jurgis
started
back
,
rushing
at
the
man
again
in
the
*NL*
middle
of
the
room
.
This
time
,
in
his
blind
frenzy
,
he
came
without
a
*NL*
bottle
,
and
that
was
all
the
bartender
wanted
--
he
met
him
halfway
and
*NL*
floored
him
with
a
sledgehammer
drive
between
the
eyes
.
An
instant
later
*NL*
the
screen
doors
flew
open
,
and
two
men
rushed
in
--
just
as
Jurgis
was
*NL*
getting
to
his
feet
again
,
foaming
at
the
mouth
with
rage
,
and
trying
to
*NL*
tear
his
broken
arm
out
of
its
bandages
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
out
!
''
shouted
the
bartender
.
``
He
's
got
a
knife
!
''
Then
,
seeing
that
*NL*
the
two
were
disposed
to
join
the
fray
,
he
made
another
rush
at
Jurgis
,
*NL*
and
knocked
aside
his
feeble
defense
and
sent
him
tumbling
again
;
and
*NL*
the
three
flung
themselves
upon
him
,
rolling
and
kicking
about
the
*NL*
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
second
later
a
policeman
dashed
in
,
and
the
bartender
yelled
once
*NL*
more
--
``
Look
out
for
his
knife
!
''
Jurgis
had
fought
himself
half
to
his
*NL*
knees
,
when
the
policeman
made
a
leap
at
him
,
and
cracked
him
across
the
*NL*
face
with
his
club
.
Though
the
blow
staggered
him
,
the
wild-beast
frenzy
*NL*
still
blazed
in
him
,
and
he
got
to
his
feet
,
lunging
into
the
air
.
Then
*NL*
again
the
club
descended
,
full
upon
his
head
,
and
he
dropped
like
a
log
*NL*
to
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
policeman
crouched
over
him
,
clutching
his
stick
,
waiting
for
him
to
*NL*
try
to
rise
again
;
and
meantime
the
barkeeper
got
up
,
and
put
his
hand
*NL*
to
his
head
.
``
Christ
!
''
he
said
,
``
I
thought
I
was
done
for
that
time
.
Did
*NL*
he
cut
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
see
anything
,
Jake
,
''
said
the
policeman
.
``
What
's
the
matter
with
*NL*
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
crazy
drunk
,
''
said
the
other
.
``
A
lame
duck
,
too
--
but
he
`
most
got
*NL*
me
under
the
bar
.
Youse
had
better
call
the
wagon
,
Billy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
the
officer
.
``
He
's
got
no
more
fight
in
him
,
I
guess
--
and
*NL*
he
's
only
got
a
block
to
go
.
''
He
twisted
his
hand
in
Jurgis
's
collar
and
*NL*
jerked
at
him
.
``
Git
up
here
,
you
!
''
he
commanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Jurgis
did
not
move
,
and
the
bartender
went
behind
the
bar
,
and
*NL*
after
stowing
the
hundred-dollar
bill
away
in
a
safe
hiding
place
,
came
*NL*
and
poured
a
glass
of
water
over
Jurgis
.
Then
,
as
the
latter
began
to
*NL*
moan
feebly
,
the
policeman
got
him
to
his
feet
and
dragged
him
out
of
*NL*
the
place
.
The
station
house
was
just
around
the
corner
,
and
so
in
a
few
*NL*
minutes
Jurgis
was
in
a
cell
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
spent
half
the
night
lying
unconscious
,
and
the
balance
moaning
in
*NL*
torment
,
with
a
blinding
headache
and
a
racking
thirst
.
Now
and
then
*NL*
he
cried
aloud
for
a
drink
of
water
,
but
there
was
no
one
to
hear
him
.
*NL*
There
were
others
in
that
same
station
house
with
split
heads
and
*NL*
a
fever
;
there
were
hundreds
of
them
in
the
great
city
,
and
tens
of
*NL*
thousands
of
them
in
the
great
land
,
and
there
was
no
one
to
hear
any
of
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
Jurgis
was
given
a
cup
of
water
and
a
piece
of
bread
,
and
*NL*
then
hustled
into
a
patrol
wagon
and
driven
to
the
nearest
police
court
.
*NL*
He
sat
in
the
pen
with
a
score
of
others
until
his
turn
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bartender
--
who
proved
to
be
a
well-known
bruiser
--
was
called
to
the
*NL*
stand
.
He
took
the
oath
and
told
his
story
.
The
prisoner
had
come
into
*NL*
his
saloon
after
midnight
,
fighting
drunk
,
and
had
ordered
a
glass
*NL*
of
beer
and
tendered
a
dollar
bill
in
payment
.
He
had
been
given
*NL*
ninety-five
cents
'
change
,
and
had
demanded
ninety-nine
dollars
more
,
*NL*
and
before
the
plaintiff
could
even
answer
had
hurled
the
glass
at
him
*NL*
and
then
attacked
him
with
a
bottle
of
bitters
,
and
nearly
wrecked
the
*NL*
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
prisoner
was
sworn
--
a
forlorn
object
,
haggard
and
unshorn
,
with
*NL*
an
arm
done
up
in
a
filthy
bandage
,
a
cheek
and
head
cut
,
and
bloody
,
*NL*
and
one
eye
purplish
black
and
entirely
closed
.
``
What
have
you
to
say
*NL*
for
yourself
?
''
queried
the
magistrate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
Honor
,
''
said
Jurgis
,
``
I
went
into
his
place
and
asked
the
man
*NL*
if
he
could
change
me
a
hundred-dollar
bill
.
And
he
said
he
would
if
*NL*
I
bought
a
drink
.
I
gave
him
the
bill
and
then
he
would
n't
give
me
the
*NL*
change
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
magistrate
was
staring
at
him
in
perplexity
.
``
You
gave
him
a
*NL*
hundred-dollar
bill
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
your
Honor
,
''
said
Jurgis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
did
you
get
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
man
gave
it
to
me
,
your
Honor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
man
?
What
man
,
and
what
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
young
man
I
met
upon
the
street
,
your
Honor
.
I
had
been
begging
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
titter
in
the
courtroom
;
the
officer
who
was
holding
Jurgis
*NL*
put
up
his
hand
to
hide
a
smile
,
and
the
magistrate
smiled
without
*NL*
trying
to
hide
it
.
``
It
's
true
,
your
Honor
!
''
cried
Jurgis
,
passionately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
been
drinking
as
well
as
begging
last
night
,
had
you
not
?
''
*NL*
inquired
the
magistrate
.
``
No
,
your
Honor
--
''
protested
Jurgis
.
``
I
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
not
had
anything
to
drink
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
yes
,
your
Honor
,
I
had
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
you
have
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
a
bottle
of
something
--
I
do
n't
know
what
it
was
--
something
that
*NL*
burned
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
again
a
laugh
round
the
courtroom
,
stopping
suddenly
as
the
*NL*
magistrate
looked
up
and
frowned
.
``
Have
you
ever
been
arrested
before
?
''
*NL*
he
asked
abruptly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
question
took
Jurgis
aback
.
``
I
--
I
--
''
he
stammered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
the
truth
,
now
!
''
commanded
the
other
,
sternly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
your
Honor
,
''
said
Jurgis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
often
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
once
,
your
Honor

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
knocking
down
my
boss

your
Honor

I
was
working
in
the
stockyards
,
*NL*
and
he

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
,
''
said
his
Honor
;
``
I
guess
that
will
do

You
ought
to
stop
*NL*
drinking
if
you

n't
control
yourself

Ten
days
and
costs

Next
case

''
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
gave
vent
to
a
cry
of
dismay
,
cut
off
suddenly
by
the
policeman
,
*NL*
who
seized
him
by
the
collar
.
He
was
jerked
out
of
the
way
,
into
a
room
*NL*
with
the
convicted
prisoners
,
where
he
sat
and
wept
like
a
child
in
*NL*
his
impotent
rage
.
It
seemed
monstrous
to
him
that
policemen
and
*NL*
judges
should
esteem
his
word
as
nothing
in
comparison
with
the
*NL*
bartender
's
--
poor
Jurgis
could
not
know
that
the
owner
of
the
saloon
*NL*
paid
five
dollars
each
week
to
the
policeman
alone
for
Sunday
privileges
*NL*
and
general
favors
--
nor
that
the
pugilist
bartender
was
one
of
the
*NL*
most
trusted
henchmen
of
the
Democratic
leader
of
the
district
,
and
had
*NL*
helped
only
a
few
months
before
to
hustle
out
a
record-breaking
vote
as
*NL*
a
testimonial
to
the
magistrate
,
who
had
been
made
the
target
of
odious
*NL*
kid-gloved
reformers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
was
driven
out
to
the
Bridewell
for
the
second
time
.
In
his
*NL*
tumbling
around
he
had
hurt
his
arm
again
,
and
so
could
not
work
,
but
*NL*
had
to
be
attended
by
the
physician
.
Also
his
head
and
his
eye
had
to
*NL*
be
tied
up
--
and
so
he
was
a
pretty-looking
object
when
,
the
second
*NL*
day
after
his
arrival
,
he
went
out
into
the
exercise
court
and
*NL*
encountered
--
Jack
Duane
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
fellow
was
so
glad
to
see
Jurgis
that
he
almost
hugged
him
.
*NL*
``
By
God
,
if
it
is
n't
`
the
Stinker
'
!
''
he
cried
.
``
And
what
is
it
--
have
you
*NL*
been
through
a
sausage
machine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Jurgis
,
``
but
I
've
been
in
a
railroad
wreck
and
a
fight
.
''
And
*NL*
then
,
while
some
of
the
other
prisoners
gathered
round
he
told
his
wild
*NL*
story
;
most
of
them
were
incredulous
,
but
Duane
knew
that
Jurgis
could
*NL*
never
have
made
up
such
a
yarn
as
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hard
luck
,
old
man
,
''
he
said
,
when
they
were
alone
;
``
but
maybe
it
's
*NL*
taught
you
a
lesson
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
learned
some
things
since
I
saw
you
last
,
''
said
Jurgis
mournfully
.
*NL*
Then
he
explained
how
he
had
spent
the
last
summer
,
``
hoboing
it
,
''
as
*NL*
the
phrase
was
.
``
And
you
?
''
he
asked
finally
.
``
Have
you
been
here
ever
*NL*
since
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
,
no
!
''
said
the
other
.
``
I
only
came
in
the
day
before
yesterday
.
*NL*
It
's
the
second
time
they
've
sent
me
up
on
a
trumped-up
charge
--
I
've
had
*NL*
hard
luck
and
ca
n't
pay
them
what
they
want
.
Why
do
n't
you
quit
Chicago
*NL*
with
me
,
Jurgis
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
no
place
to
go
,
''
said
Jurgis
,
sadly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Neither
have
I
,
''
replied
the
other
,
laughing
lightly
.
``
But
we
'll
wait
*NL*
till
we
get
out
and
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
Bridewell
Jurgis
met
few
who
had
been
there
the
last
time
,
but
*NL*
he
met
scores
of
others
,
old
and
young
,
of
exactly
the
same
sort
.
It
*NL*
was
like
breakers
upon
a
beach
;
there
was
new
water
,
but
the
wave
looked
*NL*
just
the
same
.
He
strolled
about
and
talked
with
them
,
and
the
biggest
*NL*
of
them
told
tales
of
their
prowess
,
while
those
who
were
weaker
,
or
*NL*
younger
and
inexperienced
,
gathered
round
and
listened
in
admiring
*NL*
silence
.
The
last
time
he
was
there
,
Jurgis
had
thought
of
little
but
*NL*
his
family
;
but
now
he
was
free
to
listen
to
these
men
,
and
to
realize
*NL*
that
he
was
one
of
them
--
that
their
point
of
view
was
his
point
of
view
,
*NL*
and
that
the
way
they
kept
themselves
alive
in
the
world
was
the
way
he
*NL*
meant
to
do
it
in
the
future
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
,
when
he
was
turned
out
of
prison
again
,
without
a
penny
in
his
*NL*
pocket
,
he
went
straight
to
Jack
Duane
.
He
went
full
of
humility
and
*NL*
gratitude
;
for
Duane
was
a
gentleman
,
and
a
man
with
a
profession
--
and
*NL*
it
was
remarkable
that
he
should
be
willing
to
throw
in
his
lot
with
a
*NL*
humble
workingman
,
one
who
had
even
been
a
beggar
and
a
tramp
.
Jurgis
*NL*
could
not
see
what
help
he
could
be
to
him
;
but
he
did
not
understand
*NL*
that
a
man
like
himself
--
who
could
be
trusted
to
stand
by
any
one
who
*NL*
was
kind
to
him
--
was
as
rare
among
criminals
as
among
any
other
class
of
*NL*
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
address
Jurgis
had
was
a
garret
room
in
the
Ghetto
district
,
the
*NL*
home
of
a
pretty
little
French
girl
,
Duane
's
mistress
,
who
sewed
all
*NL*
day
,
and
eked
out
her
living
by
prostitution
.
He
had
gone
elsewhere
,
she
*NL*
told
Jurgis
--
he
was
afraid
to
stay
there
now
,
on
account
of
the
police
.
*NL*
The
new
address
was
a
cellar
dive
,
whose
proprietor
said
that
he
had
*NL*
never
heard
of
Duane
;
but
after
he
had
put
Jurgis
through
a
catechism
*NL*
he
showed
him
a
back
stairs
which
led
to
a
``
fence
''
in
the
rear
of
a
*NL*
pawnbroker
's
shop
,
and
thence
to
a
number
of
assignation
rooms
,
in
one
*NL*
of
which
Duane
was
hiding
.
*NL*
*NL*
Duane
was
glad
to
see
him
;
he
was
without
a
cent
of
money
,
he
said
,
*NL*
and
had
been
waiting
for
Jurgis
to
help
him
get
some
.
He
explained
his
*NL*
plan
--
in
fact
he
spent
the
day
in
laying
bare
to
his
friend
the
criminal
*NL*
world
of
the
city
,
and
in
showing
him
how
he
might
earn
himself
a
living
*NL*
in
it
.
That
winter
he
would
have
a
hard
time
,
on
account
of
his
arm
,
and
*NL*
because
of
an
unwonted
fit
of
activity
of
the
police
;
but
so
long
as
he
*NL*
was
unknown
to
them
he
would
be
safe
if
he
were
careful
.
Here
at
``
Papa
''
*NL*
Hanson
's
-LRB-
so
they
called
the
old
man
who
kept
the
dive
-RRB-
he
might
rest
at
*NL*
ease
,
for
``
Papa
''
Hanson
was
``
square
''
--
would
stand
by
him
so
long
as
he
*NL*
paid
,
and
gave
him
an
hour
's
notice
if
there
were
to
be
a
police
raid
.
*NL*
Also
Rosensteg
,
the
pawnbroker
,
would
buy
anything
he
had
for
a
third
of
*NL*
its
value
,
and
guarantee
to
keep
it
hidden
for
a
year
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
an
oil
stove
in
the
little
cupboard
of
a
room
,
and
they
had
*NL*
some
supper
;
and
then
about
eleven
o'clock
at
night
they
sallied
forth
*NL*
together
,
by
a
rear
entrance
to
the
place
,
Duane
armed
with
a
slingshot
.
*NL*
They
came
to
a
residence
district
,
and
he
sprang
up
a
lamppost
and
blew
*NL*
out
the
light
,
and
then
the
two
dodged
into
the
shelter
of
an
area
step
*NL*
and
hid
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pretty
soon
a
man
came
by
,
a
workingman
--
and
they
let
him
go
.
Then
after
*NL*
a
long
interval
came
the
heavy
tread
of
a
policeman
,
and
they
held
their
*NL*
breath
till
he
was
gone
.
Though
half-frozen
,
they
waited
a
full
quarter
*NL*
of
an
hour
after
that
--
and
then
again
came
footsteps
,
walking
briskly
.
*NL*
Duane
nudged
Jurgis
,
and
the
instant
the
man
had
passed
they
rose
up
.
*NL*
Duane
stole
out
as
silently
as
a
shadow
,
and
a
second
later
Jurgis
heard
*NL*
a
thud
and
a
stifled
cry
.
He
was
only
a
couple
of
feet
behind
,
and
he
*NL*
leaped
to
stop
the
man
's
mouth
,
while
Duane
held
him
fast
by
the
arms
,
*NL*
as
they
had
agreed
.
But
the
man
was
limp
and
showed
a
tendency
to
fall
,
*NL*
and
so
Jurgis
had
only
to
hold
him
by
the
collar
,
while
the
other
,
*NL*
with
swift
fingers
,
went
through
his
pockets
--
ripping
open
,
first
his
*NL*
overcoat
,
and
then
his
coat
,
and
then
his
vest
,
searching
inside
and
*NL*
outside
,
and
transferring
the
contents
into
his
own
pockets
.
At
last
,
*NL*
after
feeling
of
the
man
's
fingers
and
in
his
necktie
,
Duane
whispered
,
*NL*
``
That
's
all
!
''
and
they
dragged
him
to
the
area
and
dropped
him
in
.
Then
*NL*
Jurgis
went
one
way
and
his
friend
the
other
,
walking
briskly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
arrived
first
,
and
Jurgis
found
him
examining
the
``
swag
.
''
*NL*
There
was
a
gold
watch
,
for
one
thing
,
with
a
chain
and
locket
;
there
*NL*
was
a
silver
pencil
,
and
a
matchbox
,
and
a
handful
of
small
change
,
*NL*
and
finally
a
card-case
.
This
last
Duane
opened
feverishly
--
there
were
*NL*
letters
and
checks
,
and
two
theater-tickets
,
and
at
last
,
in
the
back
*NL*
part
,
a
wad
of
bills
.
He
counted
them
--
there
was
a
twenty
,
five
tens
,
*NL*
four
fives
,
and
three
ones
.
Duane
drew
a
long
breath
.
``
That
lets
us
*NL*
out
!
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
further
examination
,
they
burned
the
card-case
and
its
contents
,
*NL*
all
but
the
bills
,
and
likewise
the
picture
of
a
little
girl
in
the
*NL*
locket
.
Then
Duane
took
the
watch
and
trinkets
downstairs
,
and
came
back
*NL*
with
sixteen
dollars
.
``
The
old
scoundrel
said
the
case
was
filled
,
''
he
*NL*
said
.
``
It
's
a
lie
,
but
he
knows
I
want
the
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
divided
up
the
spoils
,
and
Jurgis
got
as
his
share
fifty-five
*NL*
dollars
and
some
change
.
He
protested
that
it
was
too
much
,
but
the
*NL*
other
had
agreed
to
divide
even
.
That
was
a
good
haul
,
he
said
,
better
*NL*
than
average
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
got
up
in
the
morning
,
Jurgis
was
sent
out
to
buy
a
paper
;
*NL*
one
of
the
pleasures
of
committing
a
crime
was
the
reading
about
*NL*
it
afterward
.
``
I
had
a
pal
that
always
did
it
,
''
Duane
remarked
,
*NL*
laughing
--
``
until
one
day
he
read
that
he
had
left
three
thousand
dollars
*NL*
in
a
lower
inside
pocket
of
his
party
's
vest
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
half-column
account
of
the
robbery
--
it
was
evident
that
a
*NL*
gang
was
operating
in
the
neighborhood
,
said
the
paper
,
for
it
was
*NL*
the
third
within
a
week
,
and
the
police
were
apparently
powerless
.
The
*NL*
victim
was
an
insurance
agent
,
and
he
had
lost
a
hundred
and
ten
dollars
*NL*
that
did
not
belong
to
him
.
He
had
chanced
to
have
his
name
marked
*NL*
on
his
shirt
,
otherwise
he
would
not
have
been
identified
yet
.
His
*NL*
assailant
had
hit
him
too
hard
,
and
he
was
suffering
from
concussion
of
*NL*
the
brain
;
and
also
he
had
been
half-frozen
when
found
,
and
would
lose
*NL*
three
fingers
on
his
right
hand
.
The
enterprising
newspaper
reporter
had
*NL*
taken
all
this
information
to
his
family
,
and
told
how
they
had
received
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
it
was
Jurgis
's
first
experience
,
these
details
naturally
caused
*NL*
him
some
worriment
;
but
the
other
laughed
coolly
--
it
was
the
way
of
the
*NL*
game
,
and
there
was
no
helping
it
.
Before
long
Jurgis
would
think
no
*NL*
more
of
it
than
they
did
in
the
yards
of
knocking
out
a
bullock
.
``
It
's
a
*NL*
case
of
us
or
the
other
fellow
,
and
I
say
the
other
fellow
,
every
time
,
''
*NL*
he
observed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
,
''
said
Jurgis
,
reflectively
,
``
he
never
did
us
any
harm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
doing
it
to
somebody
as
hard
as
he
could
,
you
can
be
sure
of
*NL*
that
,
''
said
his
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Duane
had
already
explained
to
Jurgis
that
if
a
man
of
their
trade
were
*NL*
known
he
would
have
to
work
all
the
time
to
satisfy
the
demands
of
the
*NL*
police
.
Therefore
it
would
be
better
for
Jurgis
to
stay
in
hiding
and
*NL*
never
be
seen
in
public
with
his
pal
.
But
Jurgis
soon
got
very
tired
*NL*
of
staying
in
hiding
.
In
a
couple
of
weeks
he
was
feeling
strong
and
*NL*
beginning
to
use
his
arm
,
and
then
he
could
not
stand
it
any
longer
.
*NL*
Duane
,
who
had
done
a
job
of
some
sort
by
himself
,
and
made
a
truce
with
*NL*
the
powers
,
brought
over
Marie
,
his
little
French
girl
,
to
share
with
*NL*
him
;
but
even
that
did
not
avail
for
long
,
and
in
the
end
he
had
to
give
*NL*
up
arguing
,
and
take
Jurgis
out
and
introduce
him
to
the
saloons
and
*NL*
``
sporting
houses
''
where
the
big
crooks
and
``
holdup
men
''
hung
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
Jurgis
got
a
glimpse
of
the
high-class
criminal
world
of
*NL*
Chicago
.
The
city
,
which
was
owned
by
an
oligarchy
of
business
men
,
being
*NL*
nominally
ruled
by
the
people
,
a
huge
army
of
graft
was
necessary
for
*NL*
the
purpose
of
effecting
the
transfer
of
power
.
Twice
a
year
,
in
the
*NL*
spring
and
fall
elections
,
millions
of
dollars
were
furnished
by
the
*NL*
business
men
and
expended
by
this
army
;
meetings
were
held
and
clever
*NL*
speakers
were
hired
,
bands
played
and
rockets
sizzled
,
tons
of
documents
*NL*
and
reservoirs
of
drinks
were
distributed
,
and
tens
of
thousands
of
*NL*
votes
were
bought
for
cash
.
And
this
army
of
graft
had
,
of
course
,
to
be
*NL*
maintained
the
year
round
.
The
leaders
and
organizers
were
maintained
by
*NL*
the
business
men
directly
--
aldermen
and
legislators
by
means
of
bribes
,
*NL*
party
officials
out
of
the
campaign
funds
,
lobbyists
and
corporation
*NL*
lawyers
in
the
form
of
salaries
,
contractors
by
means
of
jobs
,
labor
*NL*
union
leaders
by
subsidies
,
and
newspaper
proprietors
and
editors
by
*NL*
advertisements
.
The
rank
and
file
,
however
,
were
either
foisted
upon
the
*NL*
city
,
or
else
lived
off
the
population
directly
.
There
was
the
police
*NL*
department
,
and
the
fire
and
water
departments
,
and
the
whole
balance
*NL*
of
the
civil
list
,
from
the
meanest
office
boy
to
the
head
of
a
city
*NL*
department
;
and
for
the
horde
who
could
find
no
room
in
these
,
there
was
*NL*
the
world
of
vice
and
crime
,
there
was
license
to
seduce
,
to
swindle
*NL*
and
plunder
and
prey
.
The
law
forbade
Sunday
drinking
;
and
this
had
*NL*
delivered
the
saloon-keepers
into
the
hands
of
the
police
,
and
made
an
*NL*
alliance
between
them
necessary
.
The
law
forbade
prostitution
;
and
this
*NL*
had
brought
the
``
madames
''
into
the
combination
.
It
was
the
same
with
the
*NL*
gambling-house
keeper
and
the
poolroom
man
,
and
the
same
with
any
other
*NL*
man
or
woman
who
had
a
means
of
getting
``
graft
,
''
and
was
willing
to
*NL*
pay
over
a
share
of
it
:
the
green-goods
man
and
the
highwayman
,
the
*NL*
pickpocket
and
the
sneak
thief
,
and
the
receiver
of
stolen
goods
,
*NL*
the
seller
of
adulterated
milk
,
of
stale
fruit
and
diseased
meat
,
the
*NL*
proprietor
of
unsanitary
tenements
,
the
fake
doctor
and
the
usurer
,
the
*NL*
beggar
and
the
``
pushcart
man
,
''
the
prize
fighter
and
the
professional
*NL*
slugger
,
the
race-track
``
tout
,
''
the
procurer
,
the
white-slave
agent
,
and
*NL*
the
expert
seducer
of
young
girls
.
All
of
these
agencies
of
corruption
*NL*
were
banded
together
,
and
leagued
in
blood
brotherhood
with
the
*NL*
politician
and
the
police
;
more
often
than
not
they
were
one
and
the
*NL*
same
person
,
--
the
police
captain
would
own
the
brothel
he
pretended
*NL*
to
raid
,
the
politician
would
open
his
headquarters
in
his
saloon
.
*NL*
``
Hinkydink
''
or
``
Bathhouse
John
,
''
or
others
of
that
ilk
,
were
proprietors
*NL*
of
the
most
notorious
dives
in
Chicago
,
and
also
the
``
gray
wolves
''
*NL*
of
the
city
council
,
who
gave
away
the
streets
of
the
city
to
the
*NL*
business
men
;
and
those
who
patronized
their
places
were
the
gamblers
and
*NL*
prize
fighters
who
set
the
law
at
defiance
,
and
the
burglars
and
holdup
*NL*
men
who
kept
the
whole
city
in
terror
.
On
election
day
all
these
powers
*NL*
of
vice
and
crime
were
one
power
;
they
could
tell
within
one
per
cent
*NL*
what
the
vote
of
their
district
would
be
,
and
they
could
change
it
at
an
*NL*
hour
's
notice
.

*NL*
A
month
ago
Jurgis
had
all
but
perished
of
starvation
upon
the
streets
;
*NL*
and
now
suddenly
,
as
by
the
gift
of
a
magic
key
,
he
had
entered
into
a
*NL*
world
where
money
and
all
the
good
things
of
life
came
freely
.
He
was
*NL*
introduced
by
his
friend
to
an
Irishman
named
``
Buck
''
Halloran
,
who
was
*NL*
a
political
``
worker
''
and
on
the
inside
of
things
.
This
man
talked
with
*NL*
Jurgis
for
a
while
,
and
then
told
him
that
he
had
a
little
plan
by
which
*NL*
a
man
who
looked
like
a
workingman
might
make
some
easy
money
;
but
it
*NL*
was
a
private
affair
,
and
had
to
be
kept
quiet
.
Jurgis
expressed
himself
*NL*
as
agreeable
,
and
the
other
took
him
that
afternoon
-LRB-
it
was
Saturday
-RRB-
to
*NL*
a
place
where
city
laborers
were
being
paid
off
.
The
paymaster
sat
in
*NL*
a
little
booth
,
with
a
pile
of
envelopes
before
him
,
and
two
policemen
*NL*
standing
by
.
Jurgis
went
,
according
to
directions
,
and
gave
the
name
of
*NL*
``
Michael
O'Flaherty
,
''
and
received
an
envelope
,
which
he
took
around
the
*NL*
corner
and
delivered
to
Halloran
,
who
was
waiting
for
him
in
a
saloon
.
*NL*
Then
he
went
again
;
and
gave
the
name
of
``
Johann
Schmidt
,
''
and
a
third
*NL*
time
,
and
give
the
name
of
``
Serge
Reminitsky
.
''
Halloran
had
quite
a
list
*NL*
of
imaginary
workingmen
,
and
Jurgis
got
an
envelope
for
each
one
.
For
*NL*
this
work
he
received
five
dollars
,
and
was
told
that
he
might
have
it
*NL*
every
week
,
so
long
as
he
kept
quiet
.
As
Jurgis
was
excellent
at
keeping
*NL*
quiet
,
he
soon
won
the
trust
of
``
Buck
''
Halloran
,
and
was
introduced
to
*NL*
others
as
a
man
who
could
be
depended
upon
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
acquaintance
was
useful
to
him
in
another
way
,
also
before
long
*NL*
Jurgis
made
his
discovery
of
the
meaning
of
``
pull
,
''
and
just
why
his
*NL*
boss
,
Connor
,
and
also
the
pugilist
bartender
,
had
been
able
to
send
him
*NL*
to
jail
.
One
night
there
was
given
a
ball
,
the
``
benefit
''
of
``
One-eyed
*NL*
Larry
,
''
a
lame
man
who
played
the
violin
in
one
of
the
big
``
high-class
''
*NL*
houses
of
prostitution
on
Clark
Street
,
and
was
a
wag
and
a
popular
*NL*
character
on
the
``
Levee
.
''
This
ball
was
held
in
a
big
dance
hall
,
and
*NL*
was
one
of
the
occasions
when
the
city
's
powers
of
debauchery
gave
*NL*
themselves
up
to
madness
.
Jurgis
attended
and
got
half
insane
with
*NL*
drink
,
and
began
quarreling
over
a
girl
;
his
arm
was
pretty
strong
by
*NL*
then
,
and
he
set
to
work
to
clean
out
the
place
,
and
ended
in
a
cell
in
*NL*
the
police
station
.
The
police
station
being
crowded
to
the
doors
,
and
*NL*
stinking
with
``
bums
,
''
Jurgis
did
not
relish
staying
there
to
sleep
off
*NL*
his
liquor
,
and
sent
for
Halloran
,
who
called
up
the
district
leader
and
*NL*
had
Jurgis
bailed
out
by
telephone
at
four
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
When
*NL*
he
was
arraigned
that
same
morning
,
the
district
leader
had
already
seen
*NL*
the
clerk
of
the
court
and
explained
that
Jurgis
Rudkus
was
a
decent
*NL*
fellow
,
who
had
been
indiscreet
;
and
so
Jurgis
was
fined
ten
dollars
and
*NL*
the
fine
was
``
suspended
''
--
which
meant
that
he
did
not
have
to
pay
for
*NL*
it
,
and
never
would
have
to
pay
it
,
unless
somebody
chose
to
bring
it
up
*NL*
against
him
in
the
future
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
the
people
Jurgis
lived
with
now
money
was
valued
according
to
an
*NL*
entirely
different
standard
from
that
of
the
people
of
Packingtown
;
yet
,
*NL*
strange
as
it
may
seem
,
he
did
a
great
deal
less
drinking
than
he
had
*NL*
as
a
workingman
.
He
had
not
the
same
provocations
of
exhaustion
and
*NL*
hopelessness
;
he
had
now
something
to
work
for
,
to
struggle
for
.
He
*NL*
soon
found
that
if
he
kept
his
wits
about
him
,
he
would
come
upon
new
*NL*
opportunities
;
and
being
naturally
an
active
man
,
he
not
only
kept
sober
*NL*
himself
,
but
helped
to
steady
his
friend
,
who
was
a
good
deal
fonder
of
*NL*
both
wine
and
women
than
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
thing
led
to
another
.
In
the
saloon
where
Jurgis
met
``
Buck
''
Halloran
*NL*
he
was
sitting
late
one
night
with
Duane
,
when
a
``
country
customer
''
*NL*
-LRB-
a
buyer
for
an
out-of-town
merchant
-RRB-
came
in
,
a
little
more
than
half
*NL*
``
piped
.
''
There
was
no
one
else
in
the
place
but
the
bartender
,
and
as
*NL*
the
man
went
out
again
Jurgis
and
Duane
followed
him
;
he
went
round
*NL*
the
corner
,
and
in
a
dark
place
made
by
a
combination
of
the
elevated
*NL*
railroad
and
an
unrented
building
,
Jurgis
leaped
forward
and
shoved
a
*NL*
revolver
under
his
nose
,
while
Duane
,
with
his
hat
pulled
over
his
eyes
,
*NL*
went
through
the
man
's
pockets
with
lightning
fingers
.
They
got
his
*NL*
watch
and
his
``
wad
,
''
and
were
round
the
corner
again
and
into
the
saloon
*NL*
before
he
could
shout
more
than
once
.
The
bartender
,
to
whom
they
had
*NL*
tipped
the
wink
,
had
the
cellar
door
open
for
them
,
and
they
vanished
,
*NL*
making
their
way
by
a
secret
entrance
to
a
brothel
next
door
.
From
the
*NL*
roof
of
this
there
was
access
to
three
similar
places
beyond
.
By
means
*NL*
of
these
passages
the
customers
of
any
one
place
could
be
gotten
out
*NL*
of
the
way
,
in
case
a
falling
out
with
the
police
chanced
to
lead
to
a
*NL*
raid
;
and
also
it
was
necessary
to
have
a
way
of
getting
a
girl
out
*NL*
of
reach
in
case
of
an
emergency
.
Thousands
of
them
came
to
Chicago
*NL*
answering
advertisements
for
``
servants
''
and
``
factory
hands
,
''
and
found
*NL*
themselves
trapped
by
fake
employment
agencies
,
and
locked
up
in
a
*NL*
bawdy-house
.
It
was
generally
enough
to
take
all
their
clothes
away
from
*NL*
them
;
but
sometimes
they
would
have
to
be
``
doped
''
and
kept
prisoners
for
*NL*
weeks
;
and
meantime
their
parents
might
be
telegraphing
the
police
,
and
*NL*
even
coming
on
to
see
why
nothing
was
done
.
Occasionally
there
was
no
*NL*
way
of
satisfying
them
but
to
let
them
search
the
place
to
which
the
*NL*
girl
had
been
traced
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
his
help
in
this
little
job
,
the
bartender
received
twenty
out
of
*NL*
the
hundred
and
thirty
odd
dollars
that
the
pair
secured
;
and
naturally
*NL*
this
put
them
on
friendly
terms
with
him
,
and
a
few
days
later
he
*NL*
introduced
them
to
a
little
``
sheeny
''
named
Goldberger
,
one
of
the
*NL*
``
runners
''
of
the
``
sporting
house
''
where
they
had
been
hidden
.
After
a
*NL*
few
drinks
Goldberger
began
,
with
some
hesitation
,
to
narrate
how
he
had
*NL*
had
a
quarrel
over
his
best
girl
with
a
professional
``
cardsharp
,
''
who
*NL*
had
hit
him
in
the
jaw
.
The
fellow
was
a
stranger
in
Chicago
,
and
if
he
*NL*
was
found
some
night
with
his
head
cracked
there
would
be
no
one
to
care
*NL*
very
much
.
Jurgis
,
who
by
this
time
would
cheerfully
have
cracked
the
*NL*
heads
of
all
the
gamblers
in
Chicago
,
inquired
what
would
be
coming
to
*NL*
him
;
at
which
the
Jew
became
still
more
confidential
,
and
said
that
he
*NL*
had
some
tips
on
the
New
Orleans
races
,
which
he
got
direct
from
the
*NL*
police
captain
of
the
district
,
whom
he
had
got
out
of
a
bad
scrape
,
and
*NL*
who
``
stood
in
''
with
a
big
syndicate
of
horse
owners
.
Duane
took
all
*NL*
this
in
at
once
,
but
Jurgis
had
to
have
the
whole
race-track
situation
*NL*
explained
to
him
before
he
realized
the
importance
of
such
an
*NL*
opportunity
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
the
gigantic
Racing
Trust
.
It
owned
the
legislatures
in
*NL*
every
state
in
which
it
did
business
;
it
even
owned
some
of
the
big
*NL*
newspapers
,
and
made
public
opinion
--
there
was
no
power
in
the
land
that
*NL*
could
oppose
it
unless
,
perhaps
,
it
were
the
Poolroom
Trust
.
It
built
*NL*
magnificent
racing
parks
all
over
the
country
,
and
by
means
of
enormous
*NL*
purses
it
lured
the
people
to
come
,
and
then
it
organized
a
gigantic
*NL*
shell
game
,
whereby
it
plundered
them
of
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
*NL*
every
year
.
Horse
racing
had
once
been
a
sport
,
but
nowadays
it
was
*NL*
a
business
;
a
horse
could
be
``
doped
''
and
doctored
,
undertrained
or
*NL*
overtrained
;
it
could
be
made
to
fall
at
any
moment
--
or
its
gait
could
*NL*
be
broken
by
lashing
it
with
the
whip
,
which
all
the
spectators
would
*NL*
take
to
be
a
desperate
effort
to
keep
it
in
the
lead
.
There
were
scores
*NL*
of
such
tricks
;
and
sometimes
it
was
the
owners
who
played
them
and
made
*NL*
fortunes
,
sometimes
it
was
the
jockeys
and
trainers
,
sometimes
it
was
*NL*
outsiders
,
who
bribed
them
--
but
most
of
the
time
it
was
the
chiefs
*NL*
of
the
trust
.
Now
for
instance
,
they
were
having
winter
racing
in
New
*NL*
Orleans
and
a
syndicate
was
laying
out
each
day
's
program
in
advance
,
*NL*
and
its
agents
in
all
the
Northern
cities
were
``
milking
''
the
poolrooms
.
*NL*
The
word
came
by
long-distance
telephone
in
a
cipher
code
,
just
a
little
*NL*
while
before
each
race
;
and
any
man
who
could
get
the
secret
had
as
good
*NL*
as
a
fortune
.
If
Jurgis
did
not
believe
it
,
he
could
try
it
,
said
the
*NL*
little
Jew
--
let
them
meet
at
a
certain
house
on
the
morrow
and
make
a
*NL*
test
.
Jurgis
was
willing
,
and
so
was
Duane
,
and
so
they
went
to
one
*NL*
of
the
high-class
poolrooms
where
brokers
and
merchants
gambled
-LRB-
with
*NL*
society
women
in
a
private
room
-RRB-
,
and
they
put
up
ten
dollars
each
upon
*NL*
a
horse
called
``
Black
Beldame
,
''
a
six
to
one
shot
,
and
won
.
For
a
secret
*NL*
like
that
they
would
have
done
a
good
many
sluggings
--
but
the
next
day
*NL*
Goldberger
informed
them
that
the
offending
gambler
had
got
wind
of
what
*NL*
was
coming
to
him
,
and
had
skipped
the
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
ups
and
downs
at
the
business
;
but
there
was
always
a
living
,
*NL*
inside
of
a
jail
,
if
not
out
of
it
.
Early
in
April
the
city
elections
*NL*
were
due
,
and
that
meant
prosperity
for
all
the
powers
of
graft
.
Jurgis
,
*NL*
hanging
round
in
dives
and
gambling
houses
and
brothels
,
met
with
*NL*
the
heelers
of
both
parties
,
and
from
their
conversation
he
came
to
*NL*
understand
all
the
ins
and
outs
of
the
game
,
and
to
hear
of
a
number
of
*NL*
ways
in
which
he
could
make
himself
useful
about
election
time
.
``
Buck
''
*NL*
Halloran
was
a
``
Democrat
,
''
and
so
Jurgis
became
a
Democrat
also
;
but
he
*NL*
was
not
a
bitter
one
--
the
Republicans
were
good
fellows
,
too
,
and
were
*NL*
to
have
a
pile
of
money
in
this
next
campaign
.
At
the
last
election
the
*NL*
Republicans
had
paid
four
dollars
a
vote
to
the
Democrats
'
three
;
and
*NL*
``
Buck
''
Halloran
sat
one
night
playing
cards
with
Jurgis
and
another
man
,
*NL*
who
told
how
Halloran
had
been
charged
with
the
job
voting
a
``
bunch
''
of
*NL*
thirty-seven
newly
landed
Italians
,
and
how
he
,
the
narrator
,
had
met
*NL*
the
Republican
worker
who
was
after
the
very
same
gang
,
and
how
the
*NL*
three
had
effected
a
bargain
,
whereby
the
Italians
were
to
vote
half
and
*NL*
half
,
for
a
glass
of
beer
apiece
,
while
the
balance
of
the
fund
went
to
*NL*
the
conspirators
!
*NL*
*NL*
Not
long
after
this
,
Jurgis
,
wearying
of
the
risks
and
vicissitudes
*NL*
of
miscellaneous
crime
,
was
moved
to
give
up
the
career
for
that
of
a
*NL*
politician
.
Just
at
this
time
there
was
a
tremendous
uproar
being
raised
*NL*
concerning
the
alliance
between
the
criminals
and
the
police
.
For
the
*NL*
criminal
graft
was
one
in
which
the
business
men
had
no
direct
part
--
it
*NL*
was
what
is
called
a
``
side
line
,
''
carried
by
the
police
.
``
Wide
*NL*
open
''
gambling
and
debauchery
made
the
city
pleasing
to
``
trade
,
''
but
*NL*
burglaries
and
holdups
did
not
.
One
night
it
chanced
that
while
Jack
*NL*
Duane
was
drilling
a
safe
in
a
clothing
store
he
was
caught
red-handed
*NL*
by
the
night
watchman
,
and
turned
over
to
a
policeman
,
who
chanced
to
*NL*
know
him
well
,
and
who
took
the
responsibility
of
letting
him
make
his
*NL*
escape
.
Such
a
howl
from
the
newspapers
followed
this
that
Duane
was
*NL*
slated
for
sacrifice
,
and
barely
got
out
of
town
in
time
.
And
just
at
*NL*
that
juncture
it
happened
that
Jurgis
was
introduced
to
a
man
named
*NL*
Harper
whom
he
recognized
as
the
night
watchman
at
Brown
's
,
who
had
been
*NL*
instrumental
in
making
him
an
American
citizen
,
the
first
year
of
his
*NL*
arrival
at
the
yards
.
The
other
was
interested
in
the
coincidence
,
but
*NL*
did
not
remember
Jurgis
--
he
had
handled
too
many
``
green
ones
''
in
his
*NL*
time
,
he
said
.
He
sat
in
a
dance
hall
with
Jurgis
and
Halloran
until
one
*NL*
or
two
in
the
morning
,
exchanging
experiences
.
He
had
a
long
story
to
*NL*
tell
of
his
quarrel
with
the
superintendent
of
his
department
,
and
how
*NL*
he
was
now
a
plain
workingman
,
and
a
good
union
man
as
well
.
It
was
not
*NL*
until
some
months
afterward
that
Jurgis
understood
that
the
quarrel
with
*NL*
the
superintendent
had
been
prearranged
,
and
that
Harper
was
in
reality
*NL*
drawing
a
salary
of
twenty
dollars
a
week
from
the
packers
for
an
inside
*NL*
report
of
his
union
's
secret
proceedings
.
The
yards
were
seething
with
*NL*
agitation
just
then
,
said
the
man
,
speaking
as
a
unionist
.
The
people
of
*NL*
Packingtown
had
borne
about
all
that
they
would
bear
,
and
it
looked
as
*NL*
if
a
strike
might
begin
any
week
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
talk
the
man
made
inquiries
concerning
Jurgis
,
and
a
couple
*NL*
of
days
later
he
came
to
him
with
an
interesting
proposition
.
He
was
*NL*
not
absolutely
certain
,
he
said
,
but
he
thought
that
he
could
get
him
*NL*
a
regular
salary
if
he
would
come
to
Packingtown
and
do
as
he
was
told
,
*NL*
and
keep
his
mouth
shut
.
Harper
--
``
Bush
''
Harper
,
he
was
called
--
was
a
*NL*
right-hand
man
of
Mike
Scully
,
the
Democratic
boss
of
the
stockyards
;
*NL*
and
in
the
coming
election
there
was
a
peculiar
situation
.
There
had
*NL*
come
to
Scully
a
proposition
to
nominate
a
certain
rich
brewer
who
lived
*NL*
upon
a
swell
boulevard
that
skirted
the
district
,
and
who
coveted
the
*NL*
big
badge
and
the
``
honorable
''
of
an
alderman
.
The
brewer
was
a
Jew
,
and
*NL*
had
no
brains
,
but
he
was
harmless
,
and
would
put
up
a
rare
campaign
*NL*
fund
.
Scully
had
accepted
the
offer
,
and
then
gone
to
the
Republicans
*NL*
with
a
proposition
.
He
was
not
sure
that
he
could
manage
the
``
sheeny
,
''
*NL*
and
he
did
not
mean
to
take
any
chances
with
his
district
;
let
the
*NL*
Republicans
nominate
a
certain
obscure
but
amiable
friend
of
Scully
's
,
*NL*
who
was
now
setting
tenpins
in
the
cellar
of
an
Ashland
Avenue
saloon
,
*NL*
and
he
,
Scully
,
would
elect
him
with
the
``
sheeny
's
''
money
,
and
the
*NL*
Republicans
might
have
the
glory
,
which
was
more
than
they
would
get
*NL*
otherwise
.
In
return
for
this
the
Republicans
would
agree
to
put
up
no
*NL*
candidate
the
following
year
,
when
Scully
himself
came
up
for
reelection
*NL*
as
the
other
alderman
from
the
ward
.
To
this
the
Republicans
had
*NL*
assented
at
once
;
but
the
hell
of
it
was
--
so
Harper
explained
--
that
*NL*
the
Republicans
were
all
of
them
fools
--
a
man
had
to
be
a
fool
to
be
*NL*
a
Republican
in
the
stockyards
,
where
Scully
was
king
.
And
they
did
n't
*NL*
know
how
to
work
,
and
of
course
it
would
not
do
for
the
Democratic
*NL*
workers
,
the
noble
redskins
of
the
War
Whoop
League
,
to
support
the
*NL*
Republican
openly
.
The
difficulty
would
not
have
been
so
great
except
*NL*
for
another
fact
--
there
had
been
a
curious
development
in
stockyards
*NL*
politics
in
the
last
year
or
two
,
a
new
party
having
leaped
into
being
.
*NL*
They
were
the
Socialists
;
and
it
was
a
devil
of
a
mess
,
said
``
Bush
''
*NL*
Harper
.
The
one
image
which
the
word
``
Socialist
''
brought
to
Jurgis
was
*NL*
of
poor
little
Tamoszius
Kuszleika
,
who
had
called
himself
one
,
and
*NL*
would
go
out
with
a
couple
of
other
men
and
a
soap-box
,
and
shout
*NL*
himself
hoarse
on
a
street
corner
Saturday
nights
.
Tamoszius
had
tried
*NL*
to
explain
to
Jurgis
what
it
was
all
about
,
but
Jurgis
,
who
was
not
of
*NL*
an
imaginative
turn
,
had
never
quite
got
it
straight
;
at
present
he
was
*NL*
content
with
his
companion
's
explanation
that
the
Socialists
were
the
*NL*
enemies
of
American
institutions
--
could
not
be
bought
,
and
would
not
*NL*
combine
or
make
any
sort
of
a
``
dicker
.
''
Mike
Scully
was
very
much
*NL*
worried
over
the
opportunity
which
his
last
deal
gave
to
them
--
the
*NL*
stockyards
Democrats
were
furious
at
the
idea
of
a
rich
capitalist
*NL*
for
their
candidate
,
and
while
they
were
changing
they
might
possibly
*NL*
conclude
that
a
Socialist
firebrand
was
preferable
to
a
Republican
bum
.
*NL*
And
so
right
here
was
a
chance
for
Jurgis
to
make
himself
a
place
in
*NL*
the
world
,
explained
``
Bush
''
Harper
;
he
had
been
a
union
man
,
and
he
*NL*
was
known
in
the
yards
as
a
workingman
;
he
must
have
hundreds
of
*NL*
acquaintances
,
and
as
he
had
never
talked
politics
with
them
he
might
*NL*
come
out
as
a
Republican
now
without
exciting
the
least
suspicion
.
There
*NL*
were
barrels
of
money
for
the
use
of
those
who
could
deliver
the
goods
;
*NL*
and
Jurgis
might
count
upon
Mike
Scully
,
who
had
never
yet
gone
back
on
*NL*
a
friend
.
Just
what
could
he
do
?
Jurgis
asked
,
in
some
perplexity
,
and
*NL*
the
other
explained
in
detail
.
To
begin
with
,
he
would
have
to
go
to
the
*NL*
yards
and
work
,
and
he
might
n't
relish
that
;
but
he
would
have
what
he
*NL*
earned
,
as
well
as
the
rest
that
came
to
him
.
He
would
get
active
in
the
*NL*
union
again
,
and
perhaps
try
to
get
an
office
,
as
he
,
Harper
,
had
;
he
*NL*
would
tell
all
his
friends
the
good
points
of
Doyle
,
the
Republican
*NL*
nominee
,
and
the
bad
ones
of
the
``
sheeny
''
;
and
then
Scully
would
*NL*
furnish
a
meeting
place
,
and
he
would
start
the
``
Young
Men
's
Republican
*NL*
Association
,
''
or
something
of
that
sort
,
and
have
the
rich
brewer
's
*NL*
best
beer
by
the
hogshead
,
and
fireworks
and
speeches
,
just
like
the
*NL*
War
Whoop
League
.
Surely
Jurgis
must
know
hundreds
of
men
who
would
like
*NL*
that
sort
of
fun
;
and
there
would
be
the
regular
Republican
leaders
and
*NL*
workers
to
help
him
out
,
and
they
would
deliver
a
big
enough
majority
on
*NL*
election
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
heard
all
this
explanation
to
the
end
,
Jurgis
demanded
:
``
But
*NL*
how
can
I
get
a
job
in
Packingtown
?
I
'm
blacklisted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
which
``
Bush
''
Harper
laughed
.
``
I
'll
attend
to
that
all
right
,
''
he
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
other
replied
,
``
It
's
a
go
,
then
;
I
'm
your
man
.
''
So
Jurgis
went
*NL*
out
to
the
stockyards
again
,
and
was
introduced
to
the
political
lord
of
*NL*
the
district
,
the
boss
of
Chicago
's
mayor
.
It
was
Scully
who
owned
the
*NL*
brick-yards
and
the
dump
and
the
ice
pond
--
though
Jurgis
did
not
know
it
.
*NL*
It
was
Scully
who
was
to
blame
for
the
unpaved
street
in
which
Jurgis
's
*NL*
child
had
been
drowned
;
it
was
Scully
who
had
put
into
office
the
*NL*
magistrate
who
had
first
sent
Jurgis
to
jail
;
it
was
Scully
who
was
*NL*
principal
stockholder
in
the
company
which
had
sold
him
the
ramshackle
*NL*
tenement
,
and
then
robbed
him
of
it
.
But
Jurgis
knew
none
of
these
*NL*
things
--
any
more
than
he
knew
that
Scully
was
but
a
tool
and
puppet
of
*NL*
the
packers
.
To
him
Scully
was
a
mighty
power
,
the
``
biggest
''
man
he
had
*NL*
ever
met
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
little
,
dried-up
Irishman
,
whose
hands
shook
.
He
had
a
brief
*NL*
talk
with
his
visitor
,
watching
him
with
his
ratlike
eyes
,
and
making
*NL*
up
his
mind
about
him
;
and
then
he
gave
him
a
note
to
Mr.
Harmon
,
one
of
*NL*
the
head
managers
of
Durham
's
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
bearer
,
Jurgis
Rudkus
,
is
a
particular
friend
of
mine
,
and
I
would
*NL*
like
you
to
find
him
a
good
place
,
for
important
reasons
.
He
was
once
*NL*
indiscreet
,
but
you
will
perhaps
be
so
good
as
to
overlook
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Harmon
looked
up
inquiringly
when
he
read
this
.
``
What
does
he
mean
*NL*
by
`
indiscreet
'
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
blacklisted
,
sir
,
''
said
Jurgis
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
which
the
other
frowned
.
``
Blacklisted
?
''
he
said
.
``
How
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
And
Jurgis
turned
red
with
embarrassment
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
forgotten
that
a
blacklist
did
not
exist
.
``
I
--
that
is
--
I
had
*NL*
difficulty
in
getting
a
place
,
''
he
stammered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
was
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
got
into
a
quarrel
with
a
foreman
--
not
my
own
boss
,
sir
--
and
struck
*NL*
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
,
''
said
the
other
,
and
meditated
for
a
few
moments
.
``
What
do
you
*NL*
wish
to
do
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anything
,
sir
,
''
said
Jurgis
--
``
only
I
had
a
broken
arm
this
winter
,
and
*NL*
so
I
have
to
be
careful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
would
it
suit
you
to
be
a
night
watchman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
would
n't
do
,
sir
.
I
have
to
be
among
the
men
at
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
--
politics
.
Well
,
would
it
suit
you
to
trim
hogs
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
said
Jurgis
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Mr.
Harmon
called
a
timekeeper
and
said
,
``
Take
this
man
to
Pat
*NL*
Murphy
and
tell
him
to
find
room
for
him
somehow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
Jurgis
marched
into
the
hog-killing
room
,
a
place
where
,
in
the
*NL*
days
gone
by
,
he
had
come
begging
for
a
job
.
Now
he
walked
jauntily
,
and
*NL*
smiled
to
himself
,
seeing
the
frown
that
came
to
the
boss
's
face
as
*NL*
the
timekeeper
said
,
``
Mr.
Harmon
says
to
put
this
man
on
.
''
It
would
*NL*
overcrowd
his
department
and
spoil
the
record
he
was
trying
to
make
--
but
*NL*
he
said
not
a
word
except
``
All
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
Jurgis
became
a
workingman
once
more
;
and
straightway
he
sought
*NL*
out
his
old
friends
,
and
joined
the
union
,
and
began
to
``
root
''
for
*NL*
``
Scotty
''
Doyle
.
Doyle
had
done
him
a
good
turn
once
,
he
explained
,
*NL*
and
was
really
a
bully
chap
;
Doyle
was
a
workingman
himself
,
and
would
*NL*
represent
the
workingmen
--
why
did
they
want
to
vote
for
a
millionaire
*NL*
``
sheeny
,
''
and
what
the
hell
had
Mike
Scully
ever
done
for
them
that
they
*NL*
should
back
his
candidates
all
the
time
?
And
meantime
Scully
had
given
*NL*
Jurgis
a
note
to
the
Republican
leader
of
the
ward
,
and
he
had
gone
*NL*
there
and
met
the
crowd
he
was
to
work
with
.
Already
they
had
hired
*NL*
a
big
hall
,
with
some
of
the
brewer
's
money
,
and
every
night
Jurgis
*NL*
brought
in
a
dozen
new
members
of
the
``
Doyle
Republican
Association
.
''
*NL*
Pretty
soon
they
had
a
grand
opening
night
;
and
there
was
a
brass
band
,
*NL*
which
marched
through
the
streets
,
and
fireworks
and
bombs
and
red
*NL*
lights
in
front
of
the
hall
;
and
there
was
an
enormous
crowd
,
with
*NL*
two
overflow
meetings
--
so
that
the
pale
and
trembling
candidate
had
to
*NL*
recite
three
times
over
the
little
speech
which
one
of
Scully
's
henchmen
*NL*
had
written
,
and
which
he
had
been
a
month
learning
by
heart
.
Best
*NL*
of
all
,
the
famous
and
eloquent
Senator
Spareshanks
,
presidential
*NL*
candidate
,
rode
out
in
an
automobile
to
discuss
the
sacred
privileges
*NL*
of
American
citizenship
,
and
protection
and
prosperity
for
the
American
*NL*
workingman
.
His
inspiriting
address
was
quoted
to
the
extent
of
half
a
*NL*
column
in
all
the
morning
newspapers
,
which
also
said
that
it
could
be
*NL*
stated
upon
excellent
authority
that
the
unexpected
popularity
developed
*NL*
by
Doyle
,
the
Republican
candidate
for
alderman
,
was
giving
great
*NL*
anxiety
to
Mr.
Scully
,
the
chairman
of
the
Democratic
City
Committee
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
chairman
was
still
more
worried
when
the
monster
torchlight
*NL*
procession
came
off
,
with
the
members
of
the
Doyle
Republican
*NL*
Association
all
in
red
capes
and
hats
,
and
free
beer
for
every
voter
in
*NL*
the
ward
--
the
best
beer
ever
given
away
in
a
political
campaign
,
as
*NL*
the
whole
electorate
testified
.
During
this
parade
,
and
at
innumerable
*NL*
cart-tail
meetings
as
well
,
Jurgis
labored
tirelessly
.
He
did
not
make
*NL*
any
speeches
--
there
were
lawyers
and
other
experts
for
that
--
but
he
*NL*
helped
to
manage
things
;
distributing
notices
and
posting
placards
and
*NL*
bringing
out
the
crowds
;
and
when
the
show
was
on
he
attended
to
the
*NL*
fireworks
and
the
beer
.
Thus
in
the
course
of
the
campaign
he
handled
*NL*
many
hundreds
of
dollars
of
the
Hebrew
brewer
's
money
,
administering
it
*NL*
with
naive
and
touching
fidelity
.
Toward
the
end
,
however
,
he
learned
*NL*
that
he
was
regarded
with
hatred
by
the
rest
of
the
``
boys
,
''
because
he
*NL*
compelled
them
either
to
make
a
poorer
showing
than
he
or
to
do
without
*NL*
their
share
of
the
pie
.
After
that
Jurgis
did
his
best
to
please
them
,
*NL*
and
to
make
up
for
the
time
he
had
lost
before
he
discovered
the
extra
*NL*
bungholes
of
the
campaign
barrel
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
pleased
Mike
Scully
,
also
.
On
election
morning
he
was
out
at
four
*NL*
o'clock
,
``
getting
out
the
vote
''
;
he
had
a
two-horse
carriage
to
ride
in
,
*NL*
and
he
went
from
house
to
house
for
his
friends
,
and
escorted
them
in
*NL*
triumph
to
the
polls
.
He
voted
half
a
dozen
times
himself
,
and
voted
*NL*
some
of
his
friends
as
often
;
he
brought
bunch
after
bunch
of
the
newest
*NL*
foreigners
--
Lithuanians
,
Poles
,
Bohemians
,
Slovaks
--
and
when
he
had
put
*NL*
them
through
the
mill
he
turned
them
over
to
another
man
to
take
to
*NL*
the
next
polling
place
.
When
Jurgis
first
set
out
,
the
captain
of
the
*NL*
precinct
gave
him
a
hundred
dollars
,
and
three
times
in
the
course
of
*NL*
the
day
he
came
for
another
hundred
,
and
not
more
than
twenty-five
out
*NL*
of
each
lot
got
stuck
in
his
own
pocket
.
The
balance
all
went
for
actual
*NL*
votes
,
and
on
a
day
of
Democratic
landslides
they
elected
``
Scotty
''
*NL*
Doyle
,
the
ex-tenpin
setter
,
by
nearly
a
thousand
plurality
--
and
*NL*
beginning
at
five
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
and
ending
at
three
the
next
*NL*
morning
,
Jurgis
treated
himself
to
a
most
unholy
and
horrible
``
jag
.
''
*NL*
Nearly
every
one
else
in
Packingtown
did
the
same
,
however
,
for
there
*NL*
was
universal
exultation
over
this
triumph
of
popular
government
,
this
*NL*
crushing
defeat
of
an
arrogant
plutocrat
by
the
power
of
the
common
*NL*
people
.

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
elections
Jurgis
stayed
on
in
Packingtown
and
kept
his
*NL*
job
.
The
agitation
to
break
up
the
police
protection
of
criminals
was
*NL*
continuing
,
and
it
seemed
to
him
best
to
``
lay
low
''
for
the
present
.
He
*NL*
had
nearly
three
hundred
dollars
in
the
bank
,
and
might
have
considered
*NL*
himself
entitled
to
a
vacation
;
but
he
had
an
easy
job
,
and
force
of
*NL*
habit
kept
him
at
it
.
Besides
,
Mike
Scully
,
whom
he
consulted
,
advised
*NL*
him
that
something
might
``
turn
up
''
before
long
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
got
himself
a
place
in
a
boardinghouse
with
some
congenial
*NL*
friends
.
He
had
already
inquired
of
Aniele
,
and
learned
that
Elzbieta
*NL*
and
her
family
had
gone
downtown
,
and
so
he
gave
no
further
thought
*NL*
to
them
.
He
went
with
a
new
set
,
now
,
young
unmarried
fellows
who
were
*NL*
``
sporty
.
''
Jurgis
had
long
ago
cast
off
his
fertilizer
clothing
,
and
*NL*
since
going
into
politics
he
had
donned
a
linen
collar
and
a
greasy
red
*NL*
necktie
.
He
had
some
reason
for
thinking
of
his
dress
,
for
he
was
making
*NL*
about
eleven
dollars
a
week
,
and
two-thirds
of
it
he
might
spend
upon
*NL*
his
pleasures
without
ever
touching
his
savings
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
he
would
ride
down-town
with
a
party
of
friends
to
the
cheap
*NL*
theaters
and
the
music
halls
and
other
haunts
with
which
they
were
*NL*
familiar
.
Many
of
the
saloons
in
Packingtown
had
pool
tables
,
and
some
*NL*
of
them
bowling
alleys
,
by
means
of
which
he
could
spend
his
evenings
*NL*
in
petty
gambling
.
Also
,
there
were
cards
and
dice
.
One
time
Jurgis
got
*NL*
into
a
game
on
a
Saturday
night
and
won
prodigiously
,
and
because
he
was
*NL*
a
man
of
spirit
he
stayed
in
with
the
rest
and
the
game
continued
*NL*
until
late
Sunday
afternoon
,
and
by
that
time
he
was
``
out
''
over
twenty
*NL*
dollars
.
On
Saturday
nights
,
also
,
a
number
of
balls
were
generally
*NL*
given
in
Packingtown
;
each
man
would
bring
his
``
girl
''
with
him
,
paying
*NL*
half
a
dollar
for
a
ticket
,
and
several
dollars
additional
for
drinks
*NL*
in
the
course
of
the
festivities
,
which
continued
until
three
or
four
*NL*
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
unless
broken
up
by
fighting
.
During
all
this
*NL*
time
the
same
man
and
woman
would
dance
together
,
half-stupefied
with
*NL*
sensuality
and
drink
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
long
Jurgis
discovered
what
Scully
had
meant
by
something
*NL*
``
turning
up
.
''
In
May
the
agreement
between
the
packers
and
the
unions
*NL*
expired
,
and
a
new
agreement
had
to
be
signed
.
Negotiations
were
going
*NL*
on
,
and
the
yards
were
full
of
talk
of
a
strike
.
The
old
scale
had
dealt
*NL*
with
the
wages
of
the
skilled
men
only
;
and
of
the
members
of
the
Meat
*NL*
Workers
'
Union
about
two-thirds
were
unskilled
men
.
In
Chicago
these
*NL*
latter
were
receiving
,
for
the
most
part
,
eighteen
and
a
half
cents
an
*NL*
hour
,
and
the
unions
wished
to
make
this
the
general
wage
for
the
next
*NL*
year
.
It
was
not
nearly
so
large
a
wage
as
it
seemed
--
in
the
course
of
*NL*
the
negotiations
the
union
officers
examined
time
checks
to
the
amount
*NL*
of
ten
thousand
dollars
,
and
they
found
that
the
highest
wages
paid
had
*NL*
been
fourteen
dollars
a
week
,
and
the
lowest
two
dollars
and
five
cents
,
*NL*
and
the
average
of
the
whole
,
six
dollars
and
sixty-five
cents
.
And
six
*NL*
dollars
and
sixty-five
cents
was
hardly
too
much
for
a
man
to
keep
*NL*
a
family
on
,
considering
the
fact
that
the
price
of
dressed
meat
had
*NL*
increased
nearly
fifty
per
cent
in
the
last
five
years
,
while
the
price
*NL*
of
``
beef
on
the
hoof
''
had
decreased
as
much
,
it
would
have
seemed
that
*NL*
the
packers
ought
to
be
able
to
pay
it
;
but
the
packers
were
unwilling
*NL*
to
pay
it
--
they
rejected
the
union
demand
,
and
to
show
what
their
*NL*
purpose
was
,
a
week
or
two
after
the
agreement
expired
they
put
down
the
*NL*
wages
of
about
a
thousand
men
to
sixteen
and
a
half
cents
,
and
it
was
*NL*
said
that
old
man
Jones
had
vowed
he
would
put
them
to
fifteen
before
*NL*
he
got
through
.
There
were
a
million
and
a
half
of
men
in
the
country
*NL*
looking
for
work
,
a
hundred
thousand
of
them
right
in
Chicago
;
and
were
*NL*
the
packers
to
let
the
union
stewards
march
into
their
places
and
bind
*NL*
them
to
a
contract
that
would
lose
them
several
thousand
dollars
a
day
*NL*
for
a
year
?
Not
much
!
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
was
in
June
;
and
before
long
the
question
was
submitted
to
a
*NL*
referendum
in
the
unions
,
and
the
decision
was
for
a
strike
.
It
was
the
*NL*
same
in
all
the
packing
house
cities
;
and
suddenly
the
newspapers
and
*NL*
public
woke
up
to
face
the
gruesome
spectacle
of
a
meat
famine
.
All
*NL*
sorts
of
pleas
for
a
reconsideration
were
made
,
but
the
packers
were
*NL*
obdurate
;
and
all
the
while
they
were
reducing
wages
,
and
heading
off
*NL*
shipments
of
cattle
,
and
rushing
in
wagon-loads
of
mattresses
and
cots
.
*NL*
So
the
men
boiled
over
,
and
one
night
telegrams
went
out
from
the
union
*NL*
headquarters
to
all
the
big
packing
centers
--
to
St.
Paul
,
South
Omaha
,
*NL*
Sioux
City
,
St.
Joseph
,
Kansas
City
,
East
St.
Louis
,
and
New
York
--
and
*NL*
the
next
day
at
noon
between
fifty
and
sixty
thousand
men
drew
off
their
*NL*
working
clothes
and
marched
out
of
the
factories
,
and
the
great
``
Beef
*NL*
Strike
''
was
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
went
to
his
dinner
,
and
afterward
he
walked
over
to
see
Mike
*NL*
Scully
,
who
lived
in
a
fine
house
,
upon
a
street
which
had
been
decently
*NL*
paved
and
lighted
for
his
especial
benefit
.
Scully
had
gone
into
*NL*
semi-retirement
,
and
looked
nervous
and
worried
.
``
What
do
you
want
?
''
he
*NL*
demanded
,
when
he
saw
Jurgis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
came
to
see
if
maybe
you
could
get
me
a
place
during
the
strike
,
''
the
*NL*
other
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Scully
knit
his
brows
and
eyed
him
narrowly
.
In
that
morning
's
*NL*
papers
Jurgis
had
read
a
fierce
denunciation
of
the
packers
by
Scully
,
*NL*
who
had
declared
that
if
they
did
not
treat
their
people
better
the
*NL*
city
authorities
would
end
the
matter
by
tearing
down
their
plants
.
Now
,
*NL*
therefore
,
Jurgis
was
not
a
little
taken
aback
when
the
other
demanded
*NL*
suddenly
,
``
See
here
,
Rudkus
,
why
do
n't
you
stick
by
your
job
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
started
.
``
Work
as
a
scab
?
''
he
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
''
demanded
Scully
.
``
What
's
that
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
--
but
--
''
stammered
Jurgis
.
He
had
somehow
taken
it
for
granted
that
*NL*
he
should
go
out
with
his
union
.
``
The
packers
need
good
men
,
and
need
*NL*
them
bad
,
''
continued
the
other
,
``
and
they
'll
treat
a
man
right
that
*NL*
stands
by
them
.
Why
do
n't
you
take
your
chance
and
fix
yourself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
said
Jurgis
,
``
how
could
I
ever
be
of
any
use
to
you
--
in
*NL*
politics
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
could
n't
be
it
anyhow
,
''
said
Scully
,
abruptly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
''
asked
Jurgis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hell
,
man
!
''
cried
the
other
.
``
Do
n't
you
know
you
're
a
Republican
?
And
*NL*
do
you
think
I
'm
always
going
to
elect
Republicans
?
My
brewer
has
found
*NL*
out
already
how
we
served
him
,
and
there
is
the
deuce
to
pay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
looked
dumfounded
.
He
had
never
thought
of
that
aspect
of
it
*NL*
before
.
``
I
could
be
a
Democrat
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
responded
the
other
,
``
but
not
right
away
;
a
man
ca
n't
change
his
*NL*
politics
every
day
.
And
besides
,
I
do
n't
need
you
--
there
'd
be
nothing
*NL*
for
you
to
do
.
And
it
's
a
long
time
to
election
day
,
anyhow
;
and
what
*NL*
are
you
going
to
do
meantime
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
I
could
count
on
you
,
''
began
Jurgis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
responded
Scully
,
``
so
you
could
--
I
never
yet
went
back
on
a
*NL*
friend
.
But
is
it
fair
to
leave
the
job
I
got
you
and
come
to
me
for
*NL*
another
?
I
have
had
a
hundred
fellows
after
me
today
,
and
what
can
I
*NL*
do
?
I
've
put
seventeen
men
on
the
city
payroll
to
clean
streets
this
one
*NL*
week
,
and
do
you
think
I
can
keep
that
up
forever
?
It
would
n't
do
for
*NL*
me
to
tell
other
men
what
I
tell
you
,
but
you
've
been
on
the
inside
,
*NL*
and
you
ought
to
have
sense
enough
to
see
for
yourself
.
What
have
you
to
*NL*
gain
by
a
strike
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
n't
thought
,
''
said
Jurgis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
,
''
said
Scully
,
``
but
you
'd
better
.
Take
my
word
for
it
,
the
*NL*
strike
will
be
over
in
a
few
days
,
and
the
men
will
be
beaten
;
and
*NL*
meantime
what
you
can
get
out
of
it
will
belong
to
you
.
Do
you
see
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Jurgis
saw
.
He
went
back
to
the
yards
,
and
into
the
workroom
.
The
*NL*
men
had
left
a
long
line
of
hogs
in
various
stages
of
preparation
,
and
*NL*
the
foreman
was
directing
the
feeble
efforts
of
a
score
or
two
of
clerks
*NL*
and
stenographers
and
office
boys
to
finish
up
the
job
and
get
them
into
*NL*
the
chilling
rooms
.
Jurgis
went
straight
up
to
him
and
announced
,
``
I
*NL*
have
come
back
to
work
,
Mr.
Murphy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
boss
's
face
lighted
up
.
``
Good
man
!
''
he
cried
.
``
Come
ahead
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
a
moment
,
''
said
Jurgis
,
checking
his
enthusiasm
.
``
I
think
I
ought
*NL*
to
get
a
little
more
wages
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
replied
the
other
,
``
of
course
.
What
do
you
want
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
had
debated
on
the
way
.
His
nerve
almost
failed
him
now
,
but
he
*NL*
clenched
his
hands
.
``
I
think
I
ought
to
have
'
three
dollars
a
day
,
''
he
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
said
the
other
,
promptly
;
and
before
the
day
was
out
our
*NL*
friend
discovered
that
the
clerks
and
stenographers
and
office
boys
were
*NL*
getting
five
dollars
a
day
,
and
then
he
could
have
kicked
himself
!
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
So
Jurgis
became
one
of
the
new
``
American
heroes
,
''
a
man
whose
virtues
*NL*
merited
comparison
with
those
of
the
martyrs
of
Lexington
and
Valley
*NL*
Forge
.
The
resemblance
was
not
complete
,
of
course
,
for
Jurgis
was
*NL*
generously
paid
and
comfortably
clad
,
and
was
provided
with
a
spring
cot
*NL*
and
a
mattress
and
three
substantial
meals
a
day
;
also
he
was
perfectly
*NL*
at
ease
,
and
safe
from
all
peril
of
life
and
limb
,
save
only
in
the
*NL*
case
that
a
desire
for
beer
should
lead
him
to
venture
outside
of
the
*NL*
stockyards
gates
.
And
even
in
the
exercise
of
this
privilege
he
was
not
*NL*
left
unprotected
;
a
good
part
of
the
inadequate
police
force
of
Chicago
*NL*
was
suddenly
diverted
from
its
work
of
hunting
criminals
,
and
rushed
out
*NL*
to
serve
him
.
The
police
,
and
the
strikers
also
,
were
determined
that
*NL*
there
should
be
no
violence
;
but
there
was
another
party
interested
*NL*
which
was
minded
to
the
contrary
--
and
that
was
the
press
.
On
the
first
*NL*
day
of
his
life
as
a
strikebreaker
Jurgis
quit
work
early
,
and
in
a
*NL*
spirit
of
bravado
he
challenged
three
men
of
his
acquaintance
to
go
*NL*
outside
and
get
a
drink
.
They
accepted
,
and
went
through
the
big
Halsted
*NL*
Street
gate
,
where
several
policemen
were
watching
,
and
also
some
union
*NL*
pickets
,
scanning
sharply
those
who
passed
in
and
out
.
Jurgis
and
*NL*
his
companions
went
south
on
Halsted
Street
;
past
the
hotel
,
and
then
*NL*
suddenly
half
a
dozen
men
started
across
the
street
toward
them
and
*NL*
proceeded
to
argue
with
them
concerning
the
error
of
their
ways
.
As
the
*NL*
arguments
were
not
taken
in
the
proper
spirit
,
they
went
on
to
threats
;
*NL*
and
suddenly
one
of
them
jerked
off
the
hat
of
one
of
the
four
and
*NL*
flung
it
over
the
fence
.
The
man
started
after
it
,
and
then
,
as
a
cry
*NL*
of
``
Scab
!
''
was
raised
and
a
dozen
people
came
running
out
of
saloons
and
*NL*
doorways
,
a
second
man
's
heart
failed
him
and
he
followed
.
Jurgis
and
*NL*
the
fourth
stayed
long
enough
to
give
themselves
the
satisfaction
of
*NL*
a
quick
exchange
of
blows
,
and
then
they
,
too
,
took
to
their
heels
and
*NL*
fled
back
of
the
hotel
and
into
the
yards
again
.
Meantime
,
of
course
,
*NL*
policemen
were
coming
on
a
run
,
and
as
a
crowd
gathered
other
police
got
*NL*
excited
and
sent
in
a
riot
call
.
Jurgis
knew
nothing
of
this
,
but
went
*NL*
back
to
``
Packers
'
Avenue
,
''
and
in
front
of
the
``
Central
Time
Station
''
*NL*
he
saw
one
of
his
companions
,
breathless
and
wild
with
excitement
,
*NL*
narrating
to
an
ever
growing
throng
how
the
four
had
been
attacked
and
*NL*
surrounded
by
a
howling
mob
,
and
had
been
nearly
torn
to
pieces
.
While
*NL*
he
stood
listening
,
smiling
cynically
,
several
dapper
young
men
stood
by
*NL*
with
notebooks
in
their
hands
,
and
it
was
not
more
than
two
hours
later
*NL*
that
Jurgis
saw
newsboys
running
about
with
armfuls
of
newspapers
,
*NL*
printed
in
red
and
black
letters
six
inches
high
:
*NL*
*NL*
VIOLENCE
IN
THE
YARDS
!
STRIKEBREAKERS
SURROUNDED
BY
FRENZIED
MOB
!
*NL*
*NL*
If
he
had
been
able
to
buy
all
of
the
newspapers
of
the
United
States
*NL*
the
next
morning
,
he
might
have
discovered
that
his
beer-hunting
exploit
*NL*
was
being
perused
by
some
two
score
millions
of
people
,
and
had
served
*NL*
as
a
text
for
editorials
in
half
the
staid
and
solemn
business-men
's
*NL*
newspapers
in
the
land
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
was
to
see
more
of
this
as
time
passed
.
For
the
present
,
his
work
*NL*
being
over
,
he
was
free
to
ride
into
the
city
,
by
a
railroad
direct
from
*NL*
the
yards
,
or
else
to
spend
the
night
in
a
room
where
cots
had
been
*NL*
laid
in
rows
.
He
chose
the
latter
,
but
to
his
regret
,
for
all
night
long
*NL*
gangs
of
strikebreakers
kept
arriving
.
As
very
few
of
the
better
class
*NL*
of
workingmen
could
be
got
for
such
work
,
these
specimens
of
the
new
*NL*
American
hero
contained
an
assortment
of
the
criminals
and
thugs
of
*NL*
the
city
,
besides
Negroes
and
the
lowest
foreigners
--
Greeks
,
Roumanians
,
*NL*
Sicilians
,
and
Slovaks
.
They
had
been
attracted
more
by
the
prospect
of
*NL*
disorder
than
by
the
big
wages
;
and
they
made
the
night
hideous
with
*NL*
singing
and
carousing
,
and
only
went
to
sleep
when
the
time
came
for
*NL*
them
to
get
up
to
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
before
Jurgis
had
finished
his
breakfast
,
``
Pat
''
Murphy
*NL*
ordered
him
to
one
of
the
superintendents
,
who
questioned
him
as
to
his
*NL*
experience
in
the
work
of
the
killing
room
.
His
heart
began
to
thump
*NL*
with
excitement
,
for
he
divined
instantly
that
his
hour
had
come
--
that
*NL*
he
was
to
be
a
boss
!
*NL*
*NL*
Some
of
the
foremen
were
union
members
,
and
many
who
were
not
had
gone
*NL*
out
with
the
men
.
It
was
in
the
killing
department
that
the
packers
had
*NL*
been
left
most
in
the
lurch
,
and
precisely
here
that
they
could
least
*NL*
afford
it
;
the
smoking
and
canning
and
salting
of
meat
might
wait
,
and
*NL*
all
the
by-products
might
be
wasted
--
but
fresh
meats
must
be
had
,
or
the
*NL*
restaurants
and
hotels
and
brownstone
houses
would
feel
the
pinch
,
and
*NL*
then
``
public
opinion
''
would
take
a
startling
turn
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
opportunity
such
as
this
would
not
come
twice
to
a
man
;
and
Jurgis
*NL*
seized
it
.
Yes
,
he
knew
the
work
,
the
whole
of
it
,
and
he
could
teach
it
*NL*
to
others
.
But
if
he
took
the
job
and
gave
satisfaction
he
would
expect
*NL*
to
keep
it
--
they
would
not
turn
him
off
at
the
end
of
the
strike
?
To
*NL*
which
the
superintendent
replied
that
he
might
safely
trust
Durham
's
*NL*
for
that
--
they
proposed
to
teach
these
unions
a
lesson
,
and
most
of
*NL*
all
those
foremen
who
had
gone
back
on
them
.
Jurgis
would
receive
five
*NL*
dollars
a
day
during
the
strike
,
and
twenty-five
a
week
after
it
was
*NL*
settled
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
our
friend
got
a
pair
of
``
slaughter
pen
''
boots
and
``
jeans
,
''
and
flung
*NL*
himself
at
his
task
.
It
was
a
weird
sight
,
there
on
the
killing
beds
--
a
*NL*
throng
of
stupid
black
Negroes
,
and
foreigners
who
could
not
understand
*NL*
a
word
that
was
said
to
them
,
mixed
with
pale-faced
,
hollow-chested
*NL*
bookkeepers
and
clerks
,
half-fainting
for
the
tropical
heat
and
the
*NL*
sickening
stench
of
fresh
blood
--
and
all
struggling
to
dress
a
dozen
*NL*
or
two
cattle
in
the
same
place
where
,
twenty-four
hours
ago
,
the
old
*NL*
killing
gang
had
been
speeding
,
with
their
marvelous
precision
,
turning
*NL*
out
four
hundred
carcasses
every
hour
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
Negroes
and
the
``
toughs
''
from
the
Levee
did
not
want
to
work
,
*NL*
and
every
few
minutes
some
of
them
would
feel
obliged
to
retire
and
*NL*
recuperate
.
In
a
couple
of
days
Durham
and
Company
had
electric
fans
up
*NL*
to
cool
off
the
rooms
for
them
,
and
even
couches
for
them
to
rest
*NL*
on
;
and
meantime
they
could
go
out
and
find
a
shady
corner
and
take
a
*NL*
``
snooze
,
''
and
as
there
was
no
place
for
any
one
in
particular
,
and
no
*NL*
system
,
it
might
be
hours
before
their
boss
discovered
them
.
As
for
*NL*
the
poor
office
employees
,
they
did
their
best
,
moved
to
it
by
terror
;
*NL*
thirty
of
them
had
been
``
fired
''
in
a
bunch
that
first
morning
for
*NL*
refusing
to
serve
,
besides
a
number
of
women
clerks
and
typewriters
who
*NL*
had
declined
to
act
as
waitresses
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
such
a
force
as
this
that
Jurgis
had
to
organize
.
He
did
his
*NL*
best
,
flying
here
and
there
,
placing
them
in
rows
and
showing
them
the
*NL*
tricks
;
he
had
never
given
an
order
in
his
life
before
,
but
he
had
taken
*NL*
enough
of
them
to
know
,
and
he
soon
fell
into
the
spirit
of
it
,
and
*NL*
roared
and
stormed
like
any
old
stager
.
He
had
not
the
most
tractable
*NL*
pupils
,
however
.
``
See
hyar
,
boss
,
''
a
big
black
``
buck
''
would
begin
,
``
ef
*NL*
you
doan
'
like
de
way
Ah
does
dis
job
,
you
kin
get
somebody
else
to
do
*NL*
it
.
''
Then
a
crowd
would
gather
and
listen
,
muttering
threats
.
After
the
*NL*
first
meal
nearly
all
the
steel
knives
had
been
missing
,
and
now
every
*NL*
Negro
had
one
,
ground
to
a
fine
point
,
hidden
in
his
boots
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
bringing
order
out
of
such
a
chaos
,
Jurgis
soon
discovered
;
*NL*
and
he
fell
in
with
the
spirit
of
the
thing
--
there
was
no
reason
why
he
*NL*
should
wear
himself
out
with
shouting
.
If
hides
and
guts
were
slashed
*NL*
and
rendered
useless
there
was
no
way
of
tracing
it
to
any
one
;
and
if
*NL*
a
man
lay
off
and
forgot
to
come
back
there
was
nothing
to
be
gained
*NL*
by
seeking
him
,
for
all
the
rest
would
quit
in
the
meantime
.
Everything
*NL*
went
,
during
the
strike
,
and
the
packers
paid
.
Before
long
Jurgis
*NL*
found
that
the
custom
of
resting
had
suggested
to
some
alert
minds
the
*NL*
possibility
of
registering
at
more
than
one
place
and
earning
more
than
*NL*
one
five
dollars
a
day
.
When
he
caught
a
man
at
this
he
``
fired
''
him
,
*NL*
but
it
chanced
to
be
in
a
quiet
corner
,
and
the
man
tendered
him
a
*NL*
ten-dollar
bill
and
a
wink
,
and
he
took
them
.
Of
course
,
before
long
*NL*
this
custom
spread
,
and
Jurgis
was
soon
making
quite
a
good
income
from
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
face
of
handicaps
such
as
these
the
packers
counted
themselves
*NL*
lucky
if
they
could
kill
off
the
cattle
that
had
been
crippled
in
*NL*
transit
and
the
hogs
that
had
developed
disease
.
Frequently
,
in
the
*NL*
course
of
a
two
or
three
days
'
trip
,
in
hot
weather
and
without
water
,
*NL*
some
hog
would
develop
cholera
,
and
die
;
and
the
rest
would
attack
him
*NL*
before
he
had
ceased
kicking
,
and
when
the
car
was
opened
there
would
be
*NL*
nothing
of
him
left
but
the
bones
.
If
all
the
hogs
in
this
carload
were
*NL*
not
killed
at
once
,
they
would
soon
be
down
with
the
dread
disease
,
and
*NL*
there
would
be
nothing
to
do
but
make
them
into
lard
.
It
was
the
same
*NL*
with
cattle
that
were
gored
and
dying
,
or
were
limping
with
broken
bones
*NL*
stuck
through
their
flesh
--
they
must
be
killed
,
even
if
brokers
and
*NL*
buyers
and
superintendents
had
to
take
off
their
coats
and
help
*NL*
drive
and
cut
and
skin
them
.
And
meantime
,
agents
of
the
packers
were
*NL*
gathering
gangs
of
Negroes
in
the
country
districts
of
the
far
South
,
*NL*
promising
them
five
dollars
a
day
and
board
,
and
being
careful
not
to
*NL*
mention
there
was
a
strike
;
already
carloads
of
them
were
on
the
way
,
*NL*
with
special
rates
from
the
railroads
,
and
all
traffic
ordered
out
of
*NL*
the
way
.
Many
towns
and
cities
were
taking
advantage
of
the
chance
to
*NL*
clear
out
their
jails
and
workhouses
--
in
Detroit
the
magistrates
would
*NL*
release
every
man
who
agreed
to
leave
town
within
twenty-four
hours
,
*NL*
and
agents
of
the
packers
were
in
the
courtrooms
to
ship
them
right
.
And
*NL*
meantime
trainloads
of
supplies
were
coming
in
for
their
accommodation
,
*NL*
including
beer
and
whisky
,
so
that
they
might
not
be
tempted
to
go
*NL*
outside
.
They
hired
thirty
young
girls
in
Cincinnati
to
``
pack
fruit
,
''
*NL*
and
when
they
arrived
put
them
at
work
canning
corned
beef
,
and
put
cots
*NL*
for
them
to
sleep
in
a
public
hallway
,
through
which
the
men
passed
.
As
*NL*
the
gangs
came
in
day
and
night
,
under
the
escort
of
squads
of
police
,
*NL*
they
stowed
away
in
unused
workrooms
and
storerooms
,
and
in
the
car
*NL*
sheds
,
crowded
so
closely
together
that
the
cots
touched
.
In
some
places
*NL*
they
would
use
the
same
room
for
eating
and
sleeping
,
and
at
night
the
*NL*
men
would
put
their
cots
upon
the
tables
,
to
keep
away
from
the
swarms
*NL*
of
rats
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
with
all
their
best
efforts
,
the
packers
were
demoralized
.
*NL*
Ninety
per
cent
of
the
men
had
walked
out
;
and
they
faced
the
task
of
*NL*
completely
remaking
their
labor
force
--
and
with
the
price
of
meat
up
*NL*
thirty
per
cent
,
and
the
public
clamoring
for
a
settlement
.
They
made
an
*NL*
offer
to
submit
the
whole
question
at
issue
to
arbitration
;
and
at
the
*NL*
end
of
ten
days
the
unions
accepted
it
,
and
the
strike
was
called
off
.
*NL*
It
was
agreed
that
all
the
men
were
to
be
re-employed
within
forty-five
*NL*
days
,
and
that
there
was
to
be
``
no
discrimination
against
union
men
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
an
anxious
time
for
Jurgis
.
If
the
men
were
taken
back
``
without
*NL*
discrimination
,
''
he
would
lose
his
present
place
.
He
sought
out
the
*NL*
superintendent
,
who
smiled
grimly
and
bade
him
``
wait
and
see
.
''
Durham
's
*NL*
strikebreakers
were
few
of
them
leaving
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
or
not
the
``
settlement
''
was
simply
a
trick
of
the
packers
to
*NL*
gain
time
,
or
whether
they
really
expected
to
break
the
strike
and
*NL*
cripple
the
unions
by
the
plan
,
can
not
be
said
;
but
that
night
there
*NL*
went
out
from
the
office
of
Durham
and
Company
a
telegram
to
all
the
big
*NL*
packing
centers
,
``
Employ
no
union
leaders
.
''
And
in
the
morning
,
when
the
*NL*
twenty
thousand
men
thronged
into
the
yards
,
with
their
dinner
pails
and
*NL*
working
clothes
,
Jurgis
stood
near
the
door
of
the
hog-trimming
room
,
*NL*
where
he
had
worked
before
the
strike
,
and
saw
a
throng
of
eager
*NL*
men
,
with
a
score
or
two
of
policemen
watching
them
;
and
he
saw
a
*NL*
superintendent
come
out
and
walk
down
the
line
,
and
pick
out
man
after
*NL*
man
that
pleased
him
;
and
one
after
another
came
,
and
there
were
some
*NL*
men
up
near
the
head
of
the
line
who
were
never
picked
--
they
being
*NL*
the
union
stewards
and
delegates
,
and
the
men
Jurgis
had
heard
making
*NL*
speeches
at
the
meetings
.
Each
time
,
of
course
,
there
were
louder
*NL*
murmurings
and
angrier
looks
.
Over
where
the
cattle
butchers
were
*NL*
waiting
,
Jurgis
heard
shouts
and
saw
a
crowd
,
and
he
hurried
there
.
One
*NL*
big
butcher
,
who
was
president
of
the
Packing
Trades
Council
,
had
been
*NL*
passed
over
five
times
,
and
the
men
were
wild
with
rage
;
they
had
*NL*
appointed
a
committee
of
three
to
go
in
and
see
the
superintendent
,
and
*NL*
the
committee
had
made
three
attempts
,
and
each
time
the
police
had
*NL*
clubbed
them
back
from
the
door
.
Then
there
were
yells
and
hoots
,
*NL*
continuing
until
at
last
the
superintendent
came
to
the
door
.
``
We
all
go
*NL*
back
or
none
of
us
do
!
''
cried
a
hundred
voices
.
And
the
other
shook
his
*NL*
fist
at
them
,
and
shouted
,
``
You
went
out
of
here
like
cattle
,
and
like
*NL*
cattle
you
'll
come
back
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
suddenly
the
big
butcher
president
leaped
upon
a
pile
of
stones
and
*NL*
yelled
:
``
It
's
off
,
boys
.
We
'll
all
of
us
quit
again
!
''
And
so
the
cattle
*NL*
butchers
declared
a
new
strike
on
the
spot
;
and
gathering
their
members
*NL*
from
the
other
plants
,
where
the
same
trick
had
been
played
,
they
*NL*
marched
down
Packers
'
Avenue
,
which
was
thronged
with
a
dense
mass
of
*NL*
workers
,
cheering
wildly
.
Men
who
had
already
got
to
work
on
the
killing
*NL*
beds
dropped
their
tools
and
joined
them
;
some
galloped
here
and
there
*NL*
on
horseback
,
shouting
the
tidings
,
and
within
half
an
hour
the
whole
of
*NL*
Packingtown
was
on
strike
again
,
and
beside
itself
with
fury
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
quite
a
different
tone
in
Packingtown
after
this
--
the
place
*NL*
was
a
seething
caldron
of
passion
,
and
the
``
scab
''
who
ventured
into
*NL*
it
fared
badly
.
There
were
one
or
two
of
these
incidents
each
day
,
the
*NL*
newspapers
detailing
them
,
and
always
blaming
them
upon
the
unions
.
Yet
*NL*
ten
years
before
,
when
there
were
no
unions
in
Packingtown
,
there
was
*NL*
a
strike
,
and
national
troops
had
to
be
called
,
and
there
were
pitched
*NL*
battles
fought
at
night
,
by
the
light
of
blazing
freight
trains
.
*NL*
Packingtown
was
always
a
center
of
violence
;
in
``
Whisky
Point
,
''
where
*NL*
there
were
a
hundred
saloons
and
one
glue
factory
,
there
was
always
*NL*
fighting
,
and
always
more
of
it
in
hot
weather
.
Any
one
who
had
taken
*NL*
the
trouble
to
consult
the
station
house
blotter
would
have
found
that
*NL*
there
was
less
violence
that
summer
than
ever
before
--
and
this
while
*NL*
twenty
thousand
men
were
out
of
work
,
and
with
nothing
to
do
all
day
*NL*
but
brood
upon
bitter
wrongs
.
There
was
no
one
to
picture
the
battle
the
*NL*
union
leaders
were
fighting
--
to
hold
this
huge
army
in
rank
,
to
keep
*NL*
it
from
straggling
and
pillaging
,
to
cheer
and
encourage
and
guide
a
*NL*
hundred
thousand
people
,
of
a
dozen
different
tongues
,
through
six
long
*NL*
weeks
of
hunger
and
disappointment
and
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meantime
the
packers
had
set
themselves
definitely
to
the
task
of
making
*NL*
a
new
labor
force
.
A
thousand
or
two
of
strikebreakers
were
brought
in
*NL*
every
night
,
and
distributed
among
the
various
plants
.
Some
of
them
were
*NL*
experienced
workers
,
--
butchers
,
salesmen
,
and
managers
from
the
packers
'
*NL*
branch
stores
,
and
a
few
union
men
who
had
deserted
from
other
cities
;
*NL*
but
the
vast
majority
were
``
green
''
Negroes
from
the
cotton
districts
of
*NL*
the
far
South
,
and
they
were
herded
into
the
packing
plants
like
sheep
.
*NL*
There
was
a
law
forbidding
the
use
of
buildings
as
lodging-houses
unless
*NL*
they
were
licensed
for
the
purpose
,
and
provided
with
proper
windows
,
*NL*
stairways
,
and
fire
escapes
;
but
here
,
in
a
``
paint
room
,
''
reached
only
*NL*
by
an
enclosed
``
chute
,
''
a
room
without
a
single
window
and
only
one
*NL*
door
,
a
hundred
men
were
crowded
upon
mattresses
on
the
floor
.
Up
on
*NL*
the
third
story
of
the
``
hog
house
''
of
Jones
's
was
a
storeroom
,
without
*NL*
a
window
,
into
which
they
crowded
seven
hundred
men
,
sleeping
upon
the
*NL*
bare
springs
of
cots
,
and
with
a
second
shift
to
use
them
by
day
.
*NL*
And
when
the
clamor
of
the
public
led
to
an
investigation
into
*NL*
these
conditions
,
and
the
mayor
of
the
city
was
forced
to
order
the
*NL*
enforcement
of
the
law
,
the
packers
got
a
judge
to
issue
an
injunction
*NL*
forbidding
him
to
do
it
!
*NL*
*NL*
Just
at
this
time
the
mayor
was
boasting
that
he
had
put
an
end
*NL*
to
gambling
and
prize
fighting
in
the
city
;
but
here
a
swarm
of
*NL*
professional
gamblers
had
leagued
themselves
with
the
police
to
fleece
*NL*
the
strikebreakers
;
and
any
night
,
in
the
big
open
space
in
front
of
*NL*
Brown
's
,
one
might
see
brawny
Negroes
stripped
to
the
waist
and
pounding
*NL*
each
other
for
money
,
while
a
howling
throng
of
three
or
four
thousand
*NL*
surged
about
,
men
and
women
,
young
white
girls
from
the
country
rubbing
*NL*
elbows
with
big
buck
Negroes
with
daggers
in
their
boots
,
while
rows
of
*NL*
woolly
heads
peered
down
from
every
window
of
the
surrounding
factories
.
*NL*
The
ancestors
of
these
black
people
had
been
savages
in
Africa
;
and
*NL*
since
then
they
had
been
chattel
slaves
,
or
had
been
held
down
by
a
*NL*
community
ruled
by
the
traditions
of
slavery
.
Now
for
the
first
time
*NL*
they
were
free
--
free
to
gratify
every
passion
,
free
to
wreck
themselves
.
*NL*
They
were
wanted
to
break
a
strike
,
and
when
it
was
broken
they
would
be
*NL*
shipped
away
,
and
their
present
masters
would
never
see
them
again
;
and
*NL*
so
whisky
and
women
were
brought
in
by
the
carload
and
sold
to
them
,
and
*NL*
hell
was
let
loose
in
the
yards
.
Every
night
there
were
stabbings
and
*NL*
shootings
;
it
was
said
that
the
packers
had
blank
permits
,
which
*NL*
enabled
them
to
ship
dead
bodies
from
the
city
without
troubling
the
*NL*
authorities
.
They
lodged
men
and
women
on
the
same
floor
;
and
with
*NL*
the
night
there
began
a
saturnalia
of
debauchery
--
scenes
such
as
never
*NL*
before
had
been
witnessed
in
America
.
And
as
the
women
were
the
dregs
*NL*
from
the
brothels
of
Chicago
,
and
the
men
were
for
the
most
part
*NL*
ignorant
country
Negroes
,
the
nameless
diseases
of
vice
were
soon
rife
;
*NL*
and
this
where
food
was
being
handled
which
was
sent
out
to
every
corner
*NL*
of
the
civilized
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
``
Union
Stockyards
''
were
never
a
pleasant
place
;
but
now
they
were
*NL*
not
only
a
collection
of
slaughterhouses
,
but
also
the
camping
place
*NL*
of
an
army
of
fifteen
or
twenty
thousand
human
beasts
.
All
day
long
the
*NL*
blazing
midsummer
sun
beat
down
upon
that
square
mile
of
abominations
:
*NL*
upon
tens
of
thousands
of
cattle
crowded
into
pens
whose
wooden
floors
*NL*
stank
and
steamed
contagion
;
upon
bare
,
blistering
,
cinder-strewn
*NL*
railroad
tracks
,
and
huge
blocks
of
dingy
meat
factories
,
whose
*NL*
labyrinthine
passages
defied
a
breath
of
fresh
air
to
penetrate
them
;
*NL*
and
there
were
not
merely
rivers
of
hot
blood
,
and
car-loads
of
*NL*
moist
flesh
,
and
rendering
vats
and
soap
caldrons
,
glue
factories
and
*NL*
fertilizer
tanks
,
that
smelt
like
the
craters
of
hell
--
there
were
also
*NL*
tons
of
garbage
festering
in
the
sun
,
and
the
greasy
laundry
of
the
*NL*
workers
hung
out
to
dry
,
and
dining
rooms
littered
with
food
and
black
*NL*
with
flies
,
and
toilet
rooms
that
were
open
sewers
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
at
night
,
when
this
throng
poured
out
into
the
streets
to
*NL*
play
--
fighting
,
gambling
,
drinking
and
carousing
,
cursing
and
screaming
,
*NL*
laughing
and
singing
,
playing
banjoes
and
dancing
!
They
were
worked
*NL*
in
the
yards
all
the
seven
days
of
the
week
,
and
they
had
their
prize
*NL*
fights
and
crap
games
on
Sunday
nights
as
well
;
but
then
around
the
*NL*
corner
one
might
see
a
bonfire
blazing
,
and
an
old
,
gray-headed
Negress
,
*NL*
lean
and
witchlike
,
her
hair
flying
wild
and
her
eyes
blazing
,
yelling
*NL*
and
chanting
of
the
fires
of
perdition
and
the
blood
of
the
``
Lamb
,
''
*NL*
while
men
and
women
lay
down
upon
the
ground
and
moaned
and
screamed
in
*NL*
convulsions
of
terror
and
remorse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
were
the
stockyards
during
the
strike
;
while
the
unions
watched
*NL*
in
sullen
despair
,
and
the
country
clamored
like
a
greedy
child
for
its
*NL*
food
,
and
the
packers
went
grimly
on
their
way
.
Each
day
they
added
new
*NL*
workers
,
and
could
be
more
stern
with
the
old
ones
--
could
put
them
on
*NL*
piecework
,
and
dismiss
them
if
they
did
not
keep
up
the
pace
.
Jurgis
was
*NL*
now
one
of
their
agents
in
this
process
;
and
he
could
feel
the
change
*NL*
day
by
day
,
like
the
slow
starting
up
of
a
huge
machine
.
He
had
gotten
*NL*
used
to
being
a
master
of
men
;
and
because
of
the
stifling
heat
and
*NL*
the
stench
,
and
the
fact
that
he
was
a
``
scab
''
and
knew
it
and
despised
*NL*
himself
.
He
was
drinking
,
and
developing
a
villainous
temper
,
and
he
*NL*
stormed
and
cursed
and
raged
at
his
men
,
and
drove
them
until
they
were
*NL*
ready
to
drop
with
exhaustion
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Then
one
day
late
in
August
,
a
superintendent
ran
into
the
place
*NL*
and
shouted
to
Jurgis
and
his
gang
to
drop
their
work
and
come
.
They
*NL*
followed
him
outside
,
to
where
,
in
the
midst
of
a
dense
throng
,
they
*NL*
saw
several
two-horse
trucks
waiting
,
and
three
patrol-wagon
loads
of
*NL*
police
.
Jurgis
and
his
men
sprang
upon
one
of
the
trucks
,
and
the
driver
*NL*
yelled
to
the
crowd
,
and
they
went
thundering
away
at
a
gallop
.
Some
*NL*
steers
had
just
escaped
from
the
yards
,
and
the
strikers
had
got
hold
of
*NL*
them
,
and
there
would
be
the
chance
of
a
scrap
!
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
out
at
the
Ashland
Avenue
gate
,
and
over
in
the
direction
of
*NL*
the
``
dump
.
''
There
was
a
yell
as
soon
as
they
were
sighted
,
men
and
women
*NL*
rushing
out
of
houses
and
saloons
as
they
galloped
by
.
There
were
eight
*NL*
or
ten
policemen
on
the
truck
,
however
,
and
there
was
no
disturbance
*NL*
until
they
came
to
a
place
where
the
street
was
blocked
with
a
dense
*NL*
throng
.
Those
on
the
flying
truck
yelled
a
warning
and
the
crowd
*NL*
scattered
pell-mell
,
disclosing
one
of
the
steers
lying
in
its
blood
.
*NL*
There
were
a
good
many
cattle
butchers
about
just
then
,
with
nothing
*NL*
much
to
do
,
and
hungry
children
at
home
;
and
so
some
one
had
knocked
out
*NL*
the
steer
--
and
as
a
first-class
man
can
kill
and
dress
one
in
a
couple
*NL*
of
minutes
,
there
were
a
good
many
steaks
and
roasts
already
missing
.
*NL*
This
called
for
punishment
,
of
course
;
and
the
police
proceeded
to
*NL*
administer
it
by
leaping
from
the
truck
and
cracking
at
every
head
they
*NL*
saw
.
There
were
yells
of
rage
and
pain
,
and
the
terrified
people
fled
*NL*
into
houses
and
stores
,
or
scattered
helter-skelter
down
the
street
.
*NL*
Jurgis
and
his
gang
joined
in
the
sport
,
every
man
singling
out
his
*NL*
victim
,
and
striving
to
bring
him
to
bay
and
punch
him
.
If
he
fled
into
*NL*
a
house
his
pursuer
would
smash
in
the
flimsy
door
and
follow
him
up
the
*NL*
stairs
,
hitting
every
one
who
came
within
reach
,
and
finally
dragging
*NL*
his
squealing
quarry
from
under
a
bed
or
a
pile
of
old
clothes
in
a
*NL*
closet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
and
two
policemen
chased
some
men
into
a
bar-room
.
One
of
*NL*
them
took
shelter
behind
the
bar
,
where
a
policeman
cornered
him
and
*NL*
proceeded
to
whack
him
over
the
back
and
shoulders
,
until
he
lay
down
*NL*
and
gave
a
chance
at
his
head
.
The
others
leaped
a
fence
in
the
rear
,
*NL*
balking
the
second
policeman
,
who
was
fat
;
and
as
he
came
back
,
furious
*NL*
and
cursing
,
a
big
Polish
woman
,
the
owner
of
the
saloon
,
rushed
in
*NL*
screaming
,
and
received
a
poke
in
the
stomach
that
doubled
her
up
on
*NL*
the
floor
.
Meantime
Jurgis
,
who
was
of
a
practical
temper
,
was
helping
*NL*
himself
at
the
bar
;
and
the
first
policeman
,
who
had
laid
out
his
man
,
*NL*
joined
him
,
handing
out
several
more
bottles
,
and
filling
his
pockets
*NL*
besides
,
and
then
,
as
he
started
to
leave
,
cleaning
off
all
the
balance
*NL*
with
a
sweep
of
his
club
.
The
din
of
the
glass
crashing
to
the
floor
*NL*
brought
the
fat
Polish
woman
to
her
feet
again
,
but
another
policeman
*NL*
came
up
behind
her
and
put
his
knee
into
her
back
and
his
hands
over
her
*NL*
eyes
--
and
then
called
to
his
companion
,
who
went
back
and
broke
open
*NL*
the
cash
drawer
and
filled
his
pockets
with
the
contents
.
Then
the
three
*NL*
went
outside
,
and
the
man
who
was
holding
the
woman
gave
her
a
shove
and
*NL*
dashed
out
himself
.
The
gang
having
already
got
the
carcass
on
to
the
*NL*
truck
,
the
party
set
out
at
a
trot
,
followed
by
screams
and
curses
,
*NL*
and
a
shower
of
bricks
and
stones
from
unseen
enemies
.
These
bricks
and
*NL*
stones
would
figure
in
the
accounts
of
the
``
riot
''
which
would
be
sent
*NL*
out
to
a
few
thousand
newspapers
within
an
hour
or
two
;
but
the
episode
*NL*
of
the
cash
drawer
would
never
be
mentioned
again
,
save
only
in
the
*NL*
heartbreaking
legends
of
Packingtown
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
late
in
the
afternoon
when
they
got
back
,
and
they
dressed
out
*NL*
the
remainder
of
the
steer
,
and
a
couple
of
others
that
had
been
killed
,
*NL*
and
then
knocked
off
for
the
day
.
Jurgis
went
downtown
to
supper
,
with
*NL*
three
friends
who
had
been
on
the
other
trucks
,
and
they
exchanged
*NL*
reminiscences
on
the
way
.
Afterward
they
drifted
into
a
roulette
parlor
,
*NL*
and
Jurgis
,
who
was
never
lucky
at
gambling
,
dropped
about
fifteen
*NL*
dollars
.
To
console
himself
he
had
to
drink
a
good
deal
,
and
he
went
*NL*
back
to
Packingtown
about
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
very
much
the
*NL*
worse
for
his
excursion
,
and
,
it
must
be
confessed
,
entirely
deserving
*NL*
the
calamity
that
was
in
store
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
was
going
to
the
place
where
he
slept
,
he
met
a
painted-cheeked
*NL*
woman
in
a
greasy
``
kimono
,
''
and
she
put
her
arm
about
his
waist
to
*NL*
steady
him
;
they
turned
into
a
dark
room
they
were
passing
--
but
scarcely
*NL*
had
they
taken
two
steps
before
suddenly
a
door
swung
open
,
and
a
man
*NL*
entered
,
carrying
a
lantern
.
``
Who
's
there
?
''
he
called
sharply
.
And
*NL*
Jurgis
started
to
mutter
some
reply
;
but
at
the
same
instant
the
man
*NL*
raised
his
light
,
which
flashed
in
his
face
,
so
that
it
was
possible
*NL*
to
recognize
him
.
Jurgis
stood
stricken
dumb
,
and
his
heart
gave
a
leap
*NL*
like
a
mad
thing
.
The
man
was
Connor
!
*NL*
*NL*
Connor
,
the
boss
of
the
loading
gang
!
The
man
who
had
seduced
his
*NL*
wife
--
who
had
sent
him
to
prison
,
and
wrecked
his
home
,
ruined
his
life
!
*NL*
He
stood
there
,
staring
,
with
the
light
shining
full
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
had
often
thought
of
Connor
since
coming
back
to
Packingtown
,
but
*NL*
it
had
been
as
of
something
far
off
,
that
no
longer
concerned
him
.
*NL*
Now
,
however
,
when
he
saw
him
,
alive
and
in
the
flesh
,
the
same
thing
*NL*
happened
to
him
that
had
happened
before
--
a
flood
of
rage
boiled
up
in
*NL*
him
,
a
blind
frenzy
seized
him
.
And
he
flung
himself
at
the
man
,
and
*NL*
smote
him
between
the
eyes
--
and
then
,
as
he
fell
,
seized
him
by
the
*NL*
throat
and
began
to
pound
his
head
upon
the
stones
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
began
screaming
,
and
people
came
rushing
in
.
The
lantern
had
*NL*
been
upset
and
extinguished
,
and
it
was
so
dark
they
could
not
see
a
*NL*
thing
;
but
they
could
hear
Jurgis
panting
,
and
hear
the
thumping
of
*NL*
his
victim
's
skull
,
and
they
rushed
there
and
tried
to
pull
him
off
.
*NL*
Precisely
as
before
,
Jurgis
came
away
with
a
piece
of
his
enemy
's
flesh
*NL*
between
his
teeth
;
and
,
as
before
,
he
went
on
fighting
with
those
who
*NL*
had
interfered
with
him
,
until
a
policeman
had
come
and
beaten
him
into
*NL*
insensibility
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
Jurgis
spent
the
balance
of
the
night
in
the
stockyards
station
*NL*
house
.
This
time
,
however
,
he
had
money
in
his
pocket
,
and
when
he
came
*NL*
to
his
senses
he
could
get
something
to
drink
,
and
also
a
messenger
*NL*
to
take
word
of
his
plight
to
``
Bush
''
Harper
.
Harper
did
not
appear
,
*NL*
however
,
until
after
the
prisoner
,
feeling
very
weak
and
ill
,
had
been
*NL*
hailed
into
court
and
remanded
at
five
hundred
dollars
'
bail
to
await
*NL*
the
result
of
his
victim
's
injuries
.
Jurgis
was
wild
about
this
,
because
*NL*
a
different
magistrate
had
chanced
to
be
on
the
bench
,
and
he
had
*NL*
stated
that
he
had
never
been
arrested
before
,
and
also
that
he
had
been
*NL*
attacked
first
--
and
if
only
someone
had
been
there
to
speak
a
good
word
*NL*
for
him
,
he
could
have
been
let
off
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Harper
explained
that
he
had
been
downtown
,
and
had
not
got
the
*NL*
message
.
``
What
's
happened
to
you
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
been
doing
a
fellow
up
,
''
said
Jurgis
,
``
and
I
've
got
to
get
five
*NL*
hundred
dollars
'
bail
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
arrange
that
all
right
,
''
said
the
other
--
``
though
it
may
cost
you
*NL*
a
few
dollars
,
of
course
.
But
what
was
the
trouble
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a
man
that
did
me
a
mean
trick
once
,
''
answered
Jurgis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
a
foreman
in
Brown
's
or
used
to
be
.
His
name
's
Connor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
other
gave
a
start
.
``
Connor
!
''
he
cried
.
``
Not
Phil
Connor
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Jurgis
,
``
that
's
the
fellow
.
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
God
!
''
exclaimed
the
other
,
``
then
you
're
in
for
it
,
old
man
!
I
*NL*
ca
n't
help
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
help
me
!
Why
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
he
's
one
of
Scully
's
biggest
men
--
he
's
a
member
of
the
War-Whoop
*NL*
League
,
and
they
talked
of
sending
him
to
the
legislature
!
Phil
Connor
!
*NL*
Great
heavens
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
sat
dumb
with
dismay
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
he
can
send
you
to
Joliet
,
if
he
wants
to
!
''
declared
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ca
n't
I
have
Scully
get
me
off
before
he
finds
out
about
it
?
''
asked
*NL*
Jurgis
,
at
length
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
Scully
's
out
of
town
,
''
the
other
answered
.
``
I
do
n't
even
know
where
*NL*
he
is
--
he
's
run
away
to
dodge
the
strike
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
a
pretty
mess
,
indeed
.
Poor
Jurgis
sat
half-dazed
.
His
pull
had
*NL*
run
up
against
a
bigger
pull
,
and
he
was
down
and
out
!
``
But
what
am
I
*NL*
going
to
do
?
''
he
asked
,
weakly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
should
I
know
?
''
said
the
other
.
``
I
should
n't
even
dare
to
get
bail
*NL*
for
you
--
why
,
I
might
ruin
myself
for
life
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
there
was
silence
.
``
Ca
n't
you
do
it
for
me
,
''
Jurgis
asked
,
``
and
*NL*
pretend
that
you
did
n't
know
who
I
'd
hit
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
good
would
that
do
you
when
you
came
to
stand
trial
?
''
asked
*NL*
Harper
.
Then
he
sat
buried
in
thought
for
a
minute
or
two
.
``
There
's
*NL*
nothing
--
unless
it
's
this
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
could
have
your
bail
reduced
;
*NL*
and
then
if
you
had
the
money
you
could
pay
it
and
skip
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
will
it
be
?
''
Jurgis
asked
,
after
he
had
had
this
explained
*NL*
more
in
detail
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
the
other
.
``
How
much
do
you
own
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
got
about
three
hundred
dollars
,
''
was
the
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
was
Harper
's
reply
,
``
I
'm
not
sure
,
but
I
'll
try
and
get
you
off
*NL*
for
that
.
I
'll
take
the
risk
for
friendship
's
sake
--
for
I
'd
hate
to
see
*NL*
you
sent
to
state
's
prison
for
a
year
or
two
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
finally
Jurgis
ripped
out
his
bankbook
--
which
was
sewed
up
in
his
*NL*
trousers
--
and
signed
an
order
,
which
``
Bush
''
Harper
wrote
,
for
all
the
*NL*
money
to
be
paid
out
.
Then
the
latter
went
and
got
it
,
and
hurried
to
*NL*
the
court
,
and
explained
to
the
magistrate
that
Jurgis
was
a
*NL*
decent
fellow
and
a
friend
of
Scully
's
,
who
had
been
attacked
by
a
*NL*
strike-breaker
.
So
the
bail
was
reduced
to
three
hundred
dollars
,
and
*NL*
Harper
went
on
it
himself
;
he
did
not
tell
this
to
Jurgis
,
however
--
nor
*NL*
did
he
tell
him
that
when
the
time
for
trial
came
it
would
be
an
easy
*NL*
matter
for
him
to
avoid
the
forfeiting
of
the
bail
,
and
pocket
the
three
*NL*
hundred
dollars
as
his
reward
for
the
risk
of
offending
Mike
Scully
!
All
*NL*
that
he
told
Jurgis
was
that
he
was
now
free
,
and
that
the
best
thing
*NL*
he
could
do
was
to
clear
out
as
quickly
as
possible
;
and
so
Jurgis
*NL*
overwhelmed
with
gratitude
and
relief
,
took
the
dollar
and
fourteen
*NL*
cents
that
was
left
him
out
of
all
his
bank
account
,
and
put
it
with
the
*NL*
two
dollars
and
quarter
that
was
left
from
his
last
night
's
celebration
,
*NL*
and
boarded
a
streetcar
and
got
off
at
the
other
end
of
Chicago
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
27
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Jurgis
was
now
an
outcast
and
a
tramp
once
more
.
He
was
*NL*
crippled
--
he
was
as
literally
crippled
as
any
wild
animal
which
has
lost
*NL*
its
claws
,
or
been
torn
out
of
its
shell
.
He
had
been
shorn
,
at
one
*NL*
cut
,
of
all
those
mysterious
weapons
whereby
he
had
been
able
to
make
a
*NL*
living
easily
and
to
escape
the
consequences
of
his
actions
.
He
could
*NL*
no
longer
command
a
job
when
he
wanted
it
;
he
could
no
longer
steal
with
*NL*
impunity
--
he
must
take
his
chances
with
the
common
herd
.
Nay
worse
,
he
*NL*
dared
not
mingle
with
the
herd
--
he
must
hide
himself
,
for
he
was
one
*NL*
marked
out
for
destruction
.
His
old
companions
would
betray
him
,
for
the
*NL*
sake
of
the
influence
they
would
gain
thereby
;
and
he
would
be
made
*NL*
to
suffer
,
not
merely
for
the
offense
he
had
committed
,
but
for
others
*NL*
which
would
be
laid
at
his
door
,
just
as
had
been
done
for
some
poor
*NL*
devil
on
the
occasion
of
that
assault
upon
the
``
country
customer
''
by
him
*NL*
and
Duane
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
also
he
labored
under
another
handicap
now
.
He
had
acquired
new
*NL*
standards
of
living
,
which
were
not
easily
to
be
altered
.
When
he
had
*NL*
been
out
of
work
before
,
he
had
been
content
if
he
could
sleep
in
a
*NL*
doorway
or
under
a
truck
out
of
the
rain
,
and
if
he
could
get
fifteen
*NL*
cents
a
day
for
saloon
lunches
.
But
now
he
desired
all
sorts
of
other
*NL*
things
,
and
suffered
because
he
had
to
do
without
them
.
He
must
have
a
*NL*
drink
now
and
then
,
a
drink
for
its
own
sake
,
and
apart
from
the
food
*NL*
that
came
with
it
.
The
craving
for
it
was
strong
enough
to
master
every
*NL*
other
consideration
--
he
would
have
it
,
though
it
were
his
last
nickel
*NL*
and
he
had
to
starve
the
balance
of
the
day
in
consequence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
became
once
more
a
besieger
of
factory
gates
.
But
never
since
he
*NL*
had
been
in
Chicago
had
he
stood
less
chance
of
getting
a
job
than
just
*NL*
then
.
For
one
thing
,
there
was
the
economic
crisis
,
the
million
or
two
*NL*
of
men
who
had
been
out
of
work
in
the
spring
and
summer
,
and
were
not
*NL*
yet
all
back
,
by
any
means
.
And
then
there
was
the
strike
,
with
seventy
*NL*
thousand
men
and
women
all
over
the
country
idle
for
a
couple
of
*NL*
months
--
twenty
thousand
in
Chicago
,
and
many
of
them
now
seeking
work
*NL*
throughout
the
city
.
It
did
not
remedy
matters
that
a
few
days
later
the
*NL*
strike
was
given
up
and
about
half
the
strikers
went
back
to
work
;
for
*NL*
every
one
taken
on
,
there
was
a
``
scab
''
who
gave
up
and
fled
.
The
ten
*NL*
or
fifteen
thousand
``
green
''
Negroes
,
foreigners
,
and
criminals
were
now
*NL*
being
turned
loose
to
shift
for
themselves
.
Everywhere
Jurgis
went
he
*NL*
kept
meeting
them
,
and
he
was
in
an
agony
of
fear
lest
some
one
of
them
*NL*
should
know
that
he
was
``
wanted
.
''
He
would
have
left
Chicago
,
only
by
*NL*
the
time
he
had
realized
his
danger
he
was
almost
penniless
;
and
it
*NL*
would
be
better
to
go
to
jail
than
to
be
caught
out
in
the
country
in
*NL*
the
winter
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
end
of
about
ten
days
Jurgis
had
only
a
few
pennies
left
;
and
he
*NL*
had
not
yet
found
a
job
--
not
even
a
day
's
work
at
anything
,
not
a
chance
*NL*
to
carry
a
satchel
.
Once
again
,
as
when
he
had
come
out
of
the
hospital
,
*NL*
he
was
bound
hand
and
foot
,
and
facing
the
grisly
phantom
of
starvation
.
*NL*
Raw
,
naked
terror
possessed
him
,
a
maddening
passion
that
would
never
*NL*
leave
him
,
and
that
wore
him
down
more
quickly
than
the
actual
want
of
*NL*
food
.
He
was
going
to
die
of
hunger
!
The
fiend
reached
out
its
scaly
*NL*
arms
for
him
--
it
touched
him
,
its
breath
came
into
his
face
;
and
he
*NL*
would
cry
out
for
the
awfulness
of
it
,
he
would
wake
up
in
the
night
,
*NL*
shuddering
,
and
bathed
in
perspiration
,
and
start
up
and
flee
.
He
would
*NL*
walk
,
begging
for
work
,
until
he
was
exhausted
;
he
could
not
remain
*NL*
still
--
he
would
wander
on
,
gaunt
and
haggard
,
gazing
about
him
with
*NL*
restless
eyes
.
Everywhere
he
went
,
from
one
end
of
the
vast
city
to
the
*NL*
other
,
there
were
hundreds
of
others
like
him
;
everywhere
was
the
sight
*NL*
of
plenty
and
the
merciless
hand
of
authority
waving
them
away
.
There
is
*NL*
one
kind
of
prison
where
the
man
is
behind
bars
,
and
everything
that
*NL*
he
desires
is
outside
;
and
there
is
another
kind
where
the
things
are
*NL*
behind
the
bars
,
and
the
man
is
outside
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
was
down
to
his
last
quarter
,
Jurgis
learned
that
before
the
*NL*
bakeshops
closed
at
night
they
sold
out
what
was
left
at
half
price
,
and
*NL*
after
that
he
would
go
and
get
two
loaves
of
stale
bread
for
a
nickel
,
*NL*
and
break
them
up
and
stuff
his
pockets
with
them
,
munching
a
bit
from
*NL*
time
to
time
.
He
would
not
spend
a
penny
save
for
this
;
and
,
after
two
*NL*
or
three
days
more
,
he
even
became
sparing
of
the
bread
,
and
would
stop
*NL*
and
peer
into
the
ash
barrels
as
he
walked
along
the
streets
,
and
now
*NL*
and
then
rake
out
a
bit
of
something
,
shake
it
free
from
dust
,
and
count
*NL*
himself
just
so
many
minutes
further
from
the
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
for
several
days
he
had
been
going
about
,
ravenous
all
the
time
,
*NL*
and
growing
weaker
and
weaker
,
and
then
one
morning
he
had
a
hideous
*NL*
experience
,
that
almost
broke
his
heart
.
He
was
passing
down
a
street
*NL*
lined
with
warehouses
,
and
a
boss
offered
him
a
job
,
and
then
,
after
he
*NL*
had
started
to
work
,
turned
him
off
because
he
was
not
strong
enough
.
*NL*
And
he
stood
by
and
saw
another
man
put
into
his
place
,
and
then
picked
*NL*
up
his
coat
,
and
walked
off
,
doing
all
that
he
could
to
keep
from
*NL*
breaking
down
and
crying
like
a
baby
.
He
was
lost
!
He
was
doomed
!
There
*NL*
was
no
hope
for
him
!
But
then
,
with
a
sudden
rush
,
his
fear
gave
place
*NL*
to
rage
.
He
fell
to
cursing
.
He
would
come
back
there
after
dark
,
and
he
*NL*
would
show
that
scoundrel
whether
he
was
good
for
anything
or
not
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
still
muttering
this
when
suddenly
,
at
the
corner
,
he
came
upon
*NL*
a
green-grocery
,
with
a
tray
full
of
cabbages
in
front
of
it
.
Jurgis
,
*NL*
after
one
swift
glance
about
him
,
stooped
and
seized
the
biggest
of
*NL*
them
,
and
darted
round
the
corner
with
it
.
There
was
a
hue
and
cry
,
*NL*
and
a
score
of
men
and
boys
started
in
chase
of
him
;
but
he
came
to
an
*NL*
alley
,
and
then
to
another
branching
off
from
it
and
leading
him
into
*NL*
another
street
,
where
he
fell
into
a
walk
,
and
slipped
his
cabbage
under
*NL*
his
coat
and
went
off
unsuspected
in
the
crowd
.
When
he
had
gotten
*NL*
a
safe
distance
away
he
sat
down
and
devoured
half
the
cabbage
raw
,
*NL*
stowing
the
balance
away
in
his
pockets
till
the
next
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
about
this
time
one
of
the
Chicago
newspapers
,
which
made
much
of
*NL*
the
``
common
people
,
''
opened
a
``
free-soup
kitchen
''
for
the
benefit
of
*NL*
the
unemployed
.
Some
people
said
that
they
did
this
for
the
sake
of
the
*NL*
advertising
it
gave
them
,
and
some
others
said
that
their
motive
was
*NL*
a
fear
lest
all
their
readers
should
be
starved
off
;
but
whatever
the
*NL*
reason
,
the
soup
was
thick
and
hot
,
and
there
was
a
bowl
for
every
man
,
*NL*
all
night
long
.
When
Jurgis
heard
of
this
,
from
a
fellow
``
hobo
,
''
he
*NL*
vowed
that
he
would
have
half
a
dozen
bowls
before
morning
;
but
,
as
it
*NL*
proved
,
he
was
lucky
to
get
one
,
for
there
was
a
line
of
men
two
blocks
*NL*
long
before
the
stand
,
and
there
was
just
as
long
a
line
when
the
place
*NL*
was
finally
closed
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
depot
was
within
the
danger
line
for
Jurgis
--
in
the
``
Levee
''
*NL*
district
,
where
he
was
known
;
but
he
went
there
,
all
the
same
,
for
he
*NL*
was
desperate
,
and
beginning
to
think
of
even
the
Bridewell
as
a
place
*NL*
of
refuge
.
So
far
the
weather
had
been
fair
,
and
he
had
slept
out
every
*NL*
night
in
a
vacant
lot
;
but
now
there
fell
suddenly
a
shadow
of
the
*NL*
advancing
winter
,
a
chill
wind
from
the
north
and
a
driving
storm
of
*NL*
rain
.
That
day
Jurgis
bought
two
drinks
for
the
sake
of
the
shelter
,
and
*NL*
at
night
he
spent
his
last
two
pennies
in
a
``
stale-beer
dive
.
''
This
was
*NL*
a
place
kept
by
a
Negro
,
who
went
out
and
drew
off
the
old
dregs
of
*NL*
beer
that
lay
in
barrels
set
outside
of
the
saloons
;
and
after
he
had
*NL*
doctored
it
with
chemicals
to
make
it
``
fizz
,
''
he
sold
it
for
two
cents
a
*NL*
can
,
the
purchase
of
a
can
including
the
privilege
of
sleeping
the
night
*NL*
through
upon
the
floor
,
with
a
mass
of
degraded
outcasts
,
men
and
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
these
horrors
afflicted
Jurgis
all
the
more
cruelly
,
because
he
*NL*
was
always
contrasting
them
with
the
opportunities
he
had
lost
.
For
*NL*
instance
,
just
now
it
was
election
time
again
--
within
five
or
six
weeks
*NL*
the
voters
of
the
country
would
select
a
President
;
and
he
heard
the
*NL*
wretches
with
whom
he
associated
discussing
it
,
and
saw
the
streets
*NL*
of
the
city
decorated
with
placards
and
banners
--
and
what
words
could
*NL*
describe
the
pangs
of
grief
and
despair
that
shot
through
him
?
*NL*
*NL*
For
instance
,
there
was
a
night
during
this
cold
spell
.
He
had
begged
*NL*
all
day
,
for
his
very
life
,
and
found
not
a
soul
to
heed
him
,
until
*NL*
toward
evening
he
saw
an
old
lady
getting
off
a
streetcar
and
helped
*NL*
her
down
with
her
umbrellas
and
bundles
and
then
told
her
his
``
hard-luck
*NL*
story
,
''
and
after
answering
all
her
suspicious
questions
satisfactorily
,
*NL*
was
taken
to
a
restaurant
and
saw
a
quarter
paid
down
for
a
meal
.
And
so
*NL*
he
had
soup
and
bread
,
and
boiled
beef
and
potatoes
and
beans
,
and
pie
*NL*
and
coffee
,
and
came
out
with
his
skin
stuffed
tight
as
a
football
.
And
*NL*
then
,
through
the
rain
and
the
darkness
,
far
down
the
street
he
saw
red
*NL*
lights
flaring
and
heard
the
thumping
of
a
bass
drum
;
and
his
heart
gave
*NL*
a
leap
,
and
he
made
for
the
place
on
the
run
--
knowing
without
the
asking
*NL*
that
it
meant
a
political
meeting
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
campaign
had
so
far
been
characterized
by
what
the
newspapers
termed
*NL*
``
apathy
.
''
For
some
reason
the
people
refused
to
get
excited
over
the
*NL*
struggle
,
and
it
was
almost
impossible
to
get
them
to
come
to
meetings
,
*NL*
or
to
make
any
noise
when
they
did
come
.
Those
which
had
been
held
in
*NL*
Chicago
so
far
had
proven
most
dismal
failures
,
and
tonight
,
the
speaker
*NL*
being
no
less
a
personage
than
a
candidate
for
the
vice-presidency
of
*NL*
the
nation
,
the
political
managers
had
been
trembling
with
anxiety
.
But
*NL*
a
merciful
providence
had
sent
this
storm
of
cold
rain
--
and
now
all
it
*NL*
was
necessary
to
do
was
to
set
off
a
few
fireworks
,
and
thump
awhile
on
*NL*
a
drum
,
and
all
the
homeless
wretches
from
a
mile
around
would
pour
in
*NL*
and
fill
the
hall
!
And
then
on
the
morrow
the
newspapers
would
have
a
*NL*
chance
to
report
the
tremendous
ovation
,
and
to
add
that
it
had
been
no
*NL*
``
silk-stocking
''
audience
,
either
,
proving
clearly
that
the
high
*NL*
tariff
sentiments
of
the
distinguished
candidate
were
pleasing
to
the
*NL*
wage-earners
of
the
nation
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
Jurgis
found
himself
in
a
large
hall
,
elaborately
decorated
with
*NL*
flags
and
bunting
;
and
after
the
chairman
had
made
his
little
speech
,
*NL*
and
the
orator
of
the
evening
rose
up
,
amid
an
uproar
from
the
*NL*
band
--
only
fancy
the
emotions
of
Jurgis
upon
making
the
discovery
*NL*
that
the
personage
was
none
other
than
the
famous
and
eloquent
Senator
*NL*
Spareshanks
,
who
had
addressed
the
``
Doyle
Republican
Association
''
at
*NL*
the
stockyards
,
and
helped
to
elect
Mike
Scully
's
tenpin
setter
to
the
*NL*
Chicago
Board
of
Aldermen
!
*NL*
*NL*
In
truth
,
the
sight
of
the
senator
almost
brought
the
tears
into
*NL*
Jurgis
's
eyes
.
What
agony
it
was
to
him
to
look
back
upon
those
golden
*NL*
hours
,
when
he
,
too
,
had
a
place
beneath
the
shadow
of
the
plum
tree
!
*NL*
When
he
,
too
,
had
been
of
the
elect
,
through
whom
the
country
is
*NL*
governed
--
when
he
had
had
a
bung
in
the
campaign
barrel
for
his
own
!
And
*NL*
this
was
another
election
in
which
the
Republicans
had
all
the
money
;
*NL*
and
but
for
that
one
hideous
accident
he
might
have
had
a
share
of
it
,
*NL*
instead
of
being
where
he
was
!
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
eloquent
senator
was
explaining
the
system
of
protection
;
an
*NL*
ingenious
device
whereby
the
workingman
permitted
the
manufacturer
to
*NL*
charge
him
higher
prices
,
in
order
that
he
might
receive
higher
wages
;
*NL*
thus
taking
his
money
out
of
his
pocket
with
one
hand
,
and
putting
a
*NL*
part
of
it
back
with
the
other
.
To
the
senator
this
unique
arrangement
*NL*
had
somehow
become
identified
with
the
higher
verities
of
the
universe
.
*NL*
It
was
because
of
it
that
Columbia
was
the
gem
of
the
ocean
;
and
all
her
*NL*
future
triumphs
,
her
power
and
good
repute
among
the
nations
,
depended
*NL*
upon
the
zeal
and
fidelity
with
which
each
citizen
held
up
the
hands
of
*NL*
those
who
were
toiling
to
maintain
it
.
The
name
of
this
heroic
company
*NL*
was
``
the
Grand
Old
Party
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
And
here
the
band
began
to
play
,
and
Jurgis
sat
up
with
a
violent
*NL*
start
.
Singular
as
it
may
seem
,
Jurgis
was
making
a
desperate
effort
*NL*
to
understand
what
the
senator
was
saying
--
to
comprehend
the
extent
of
*NL*
American
prosperity
,
the
enormous
expansion
of
American
commerce
,
and
*NL*
the
Republic
's
future
in
the
Pacific
and
in
South
America
,
and
wherever
*NL*
else
the
oppressed
were
groaning
.
The
reason
for
it
was
that
he
wanted
*NL*
to
keep
awake
.
He
knew
that
if
he
allowed
himself
to
fall
asleep
*NL*
he
would
begin
to
snore
loudly
;
and
so
he
must
listen
--
he
must
be
*NL*
interested
!
But
he
had
eaten
such
a
big
dinner
,
and
he
was
so
exhausted
,
*NL*
and
the
hall
was
so
warm
,
and
his
seat
was
so
comfortable
!
The
senator
's
*NL*
gaunt
form
began
to
grow
dim
and
hazy
,
to
tower
before
him
and
dance
*NL*
about
,
with
figures
of
exports
and
imports
.
Once
his
neighbor
gave
him
*NL*
a
savage
poke
in
the
ribs
,
and
he
sat
up
with
a
start
and
tried
to
look
*NL*
innocent
;
but
then
he
was
at
it
again
,
and
men
began
to
stare
at
him
*NL*
with
annoyance
,
and
to
call
out
in
vexation
.
Finally
one
of
them
called
*NL*
a
policeman
,
who
came
and
grabbed
Jurgis
by
the
collar
,
and
jerked
him
*NL*
to
his
feet
,
bewildered
and
terrified
.
Some
of
the
audience
turned
to
*NL*
see
the
commotion
,
and
Senator
Spareshanks
faltered
in
his
speech
;
but
a
*NL*
voice
shouted
cheerily
:
``
We
're
just
firing
a
bum
!
Go
ahead
,
old
sport
!
''
*NL*
And
so
the
crowd
roared
,
and
the
senator
smiled
genially
,
and
went
on
;
*NL*
and
in
a
few
seconds
poor
Jurgis
found
himself
landed
out
in
the
rain
,
*NL*
with
a
kick
and
a
string
of
curses
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
got
into
the
shelter
of
a
doorway
and
took
stock
of
himself
.
He
was
*NL*
not
hurt
,
and
he
was
not
arrested
--
more
than
he
had
any
right
to
expect
.
*NL*
He
swore
at
himself
and
his
luck
for
a
while
,
and
then
turned
his
*NL*
thoughts
to
practical
matters
.
He
had
no
money
,
and
no
place
to
sleep
;
*NL*
he
must
begin
begging
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
out
,
hunching
his
shoulders
together
and
shivering
at
the
touch
*NL*
of
the
icy
rain
.
Coming
down
the
street
toward
him
was
a
lady
,
well
*NL*
dressed
,
and
protected
by
an
umbrella
;
and
he
turned
and
walked
beside
*NL*
her
.
``
Please
,
ma'am
,
''
he
began
,
``
could
you
lend
me
the
price
of
a
*NL*
night
's
lodging
?
I
'm
a
poor
working-man
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
suddenly
,
he
stopped
short
.
By
the
light
of
a
street
lamp
he
had
*NL*
caught
sight
of
the
lady
's
face
.
He
knew
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Alena
Jasaityte
,
who
had
been
the
belle
of
his
wedding
feast
!
*NL*
Alena
Jasaityte
,
who
had
looked
so
beautiful
,
and
danced
with
such
a
*NL*
queenly
air
,
with
Juozas
Raczius
,
the
teamster
!
Jurgis
had
only
seen
*NL*
her
once
or
twice
afterward
,
for
Juozas
had
thrown
her
over
for
another
*NL*
girl
,
and
Alena
had
gone
away
from
Packingtown
,
no
one
knew
where
.
And
*NL*
now
he
met
her
here
!
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
as
much
surprised
as
he
was
.
``
Jurgis
Rudkus
!
''
she
gasped
.
``
And
*NL*
what
in
the
world
is
the
matter
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
--
I
've
had
hard
luck
,
''
he
stammered
.
``
I
'm
out
of
work
,
and
I
've
no
*NL*
home
and
no
money
.
And
you
,
Alena
--
are
you
married
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
answered
,
``
I
'm
not
married
,
but
I
've
got
a
good
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
stood
staring
at
each
other
for
a
few
moments
longer
.
Finally
Alena
*NL*
spoke
again
.
``
Jurgis
,
''
she
said
,
``
I
'd
help
you
if
I
could
,
upon
my
*NL*
word
I
would
,
but
it
happens
that
I
've
come
out
without
my
purse
,
and
*NL*
I
honestly
have
n't
a
penny
with
me
:
I
can
do
something
better
for
you
,
*NL*
though
--
I
can
tell
you
how
to
get
help
.
I
can
tell
you
where
Marija
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
gave
a
start
.
``
Marija
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Alena
;
``
and
she
'll
help
you
.
She
's
got
a
place
,
and
she
's
*NL*
doing
well
;
she
'll
be
glad
to
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
much
more
than
a
year
since
Jurgis
had
left
Packingtown
,
*NL*
feeling
like
one
escaped
from
jail
;
and
it
had
been
from
Marija
and
*NL*
Elzbieta
that
he
was
escaping
.
But
now
,
at
the
mere
mention
of
them
,
his
*NL*
whole
being
cried
out
with
joy
.
He
wanted
to
see
them
;
he
wanted
to
go
*NL*
home
!
They
would
help
him
--
they
would
be
kind
to
him
.
In
a
flash
he
had
*NL*
thought
over
the
situation
.
He
had
a
good
excuse
for
running
away
--
his
*NL*
grief
at
the
death
of
his
son
;
and
also
he
had
a
good
excuse
for
not
*NL*
returning
--
the
fact
that
they
had
left
Packingtown
.
``
All
right
,
''
he
*NL*
said
,
``
I
'll
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
she
gave
him
a
number
on
Clark
Street
,
adding
,
``
There
's
no
need
*NL*
to
give
you
my
address
,
because
Marija
knows
it
.
''
And
Jurgis
set
out
,
*NL*
without
further
ado
.
He
found
a
large
brownstone
house
of
aristocratic
*NL*
appearance
,
and
rang
the
basement
bell
.
A
young
colored
girl
came
to
the
*NL*
door
,
opening
it
about
an
inch
,
and
gazing
at
him
suspiciously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
?
''
she
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
Marija
Berczynskas
live
here
?
''
he
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dunno
,
''
said
the
girl
.
``
What
you
want
wid
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
see
her
,
''
said
he
;
``
she
's
a
relative
of
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
hesitated
a
moment
.
Then
she
opened
the
door
and
said
,
``
Come
*NL*
in
.
''
Jurgis
came
and
stood
in
the
hall
,
and
she
continued
:
``
I
'll
go
see
.
*NL*
What
's
yo
'
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
her
it
's
Jurgis
,
''
he
answered
,
and
the
girl
went
upstairs
.
She
*NL*
came
back
at
the
end
of
a
minute
or
two
,
and
replied
,
``
Dey
ai
n't
no
sich
*NL*
person
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
's
heart
went
down
into
his
boots
.
``
I
was
told
this
was
where
she
*NL*
lived
!
''
he
cried
.
But
the
girl
only
shook
her
head
.
``
De
lady
says
dey
*NL*
ai
n't
no
sich
person
here
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
stood
for
a
moment
,
hesitating
,
helpless
with
dismay
.
Then
he
*NL*
turned
to
go
to
the
door
.
At
the
same
instant
,
however
,
there
came
a
*NL*
knock
upon
it
,
and
the
girl
went
to
open
it
.
Jurgis
heard
the
shuffling
*NL*
of
feet
,
and
then
heard
her
give
a
cry
;
and
the
next
moment
she
sprang
*NL*
back
,
and
past
him
,
her
eyes
shining
white
with
terror
,
and
bounded
up
*NL*
the
stairway
,
screaming
at
the
top
of
her
lungs
:
``
Police
!
Police
!
We
're
*NL*
pinched
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
stood
for
a
second
,
bewildered
.
Then
,
seeing
blue-coated
forms
*NL*
rushing
upon
him
,
he
sprang
after
the
Negress
.
Her
cries
had
been
the
*NL*
signal
for
a
wild
uproar
above
;
the
house
was
full
of
people
,
and
as
he
*NL*
entered
the
hallway
he
saw
them
rushing
hither
and
thither
,
crying
and
*NL*
screaming
with
alarm
.
There
were
men
and
women
,
the
latter
clad
for
the
*NL*
most
part
in
wrappers
,
the
former
in
all
stages
of
dishabille
.
At
one
*NL*
side
Jurgis
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
big
apartment
with
plush-covered
*NL*
chairs
,
and
tables
covered
with
trays
and
glasses
.
There
were
playing
*NL*
cards
scattered
all
over
the
floor
--
one
of
the
tables
had
been
upset
,
*NL*
and
bottles
of
wine
were
rolling
about
,
their
contents
running
out
upon
*NL*
the
carpet
.
There
was
a
young
girl
who
had
fainted
,
and
two
men
who
were
*NL*
supporting
her
;
and
there
were
a
dozen
others
crowding
toward
the
front
*NL*
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
,
however
,
there
came
a
series
of
resounding
blows
upon
it
,
*NL*
causing
the
crowd
to
give
back
.
At
the
same
instant
a
stout
woman
,
with
*NL*
painted
cheeks
and
diamonds
in
her
ears
,
came
running
down
the
stairs
,
*NL*
panting
breathlessly
:
``
To
the
rear
!
Quick
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
led
the
way
to
a
back
staircase
,
Jurgis
following
;
in
the
kitchen
*NL*
she
pressed
a
spring
,
and
a
cupboard
gave
way
and
opened
,
disclosing
a
*NL*
dark
passageway
.
``
Go
in
!
''
she
cried
to
the
crowd
,
which
now
amounted
to
*NL*
twenty
or
thirty
,
and
they
began
to
pass
through
.
Scarcely
had
the
last
*NL*
one
disappeared
,
however
,
before
there
were
cries
from
in
front
,
and
*NL*
then
the
panic-stricken
throng
poured
out
again
,
exclaiming
:
``
They
're
*NL*
there
too
!
We
're
trapped
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upstairs
!
''
cried
the
woman
,
and
there
was
another
rush
of
the
mob
,
*NL*
women
and
men
cursing
and
screaming
and
fighting
to
be
first
.
One
*NL*
flight
,
two
,
three
--
and
then
there
was
a
ladder
to
the
roof
,
with
a
*NL*
crowd
packed
at
the
foot
of
it
,
and
one
man
at
the
top
,
straining
and
*NL*
struggling
to
lift
the
trap
door
.
It
was
not
to
be
stirred
,
however
,
*NL*
and
when
the
woman
shouted
up
to
unhook
it
,
he
answered
:
``
It
's
already
*NL*
unhooked
.
There
's
somebody
sitting
on
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
a
moment
later
came
a
voice
from
downstairs
:
``
You
might
as
well
*NL*
quit
,
you
people
.
We
mean
business
,
this
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
crowd
subsided
;
and
a
few
moments
later
several
policemen
came
*NL*
up
,
staring
here
and
there
,
and
leering
at
their
victims
.
Of
the
latter
*NL*
the
men
were
for
the
most
part
frightened
and
sheepish-looking
.
The
*NL*
women
took
it
as
a
joke
,
as
if
they
were
used
to
it
--
though
if
they
had
*NL*
been
pale
,
one
could
not
have
told
,
for
the
paint
on
their
cheeks
.
One
*NL*
black-eyed
young
girl
perched
herself
upon
the
top
of
the
balustrade
,
*NL*
and
began
to
kick
with
her
slippered
foot
at
the
helmets
of
the
*NL*
policemen
,
until
one
of
them
caught
her
by
the
ankle
and
pulled
her
*NL*
down
.
On
the
floor
below
four
or
five
other
girls
sat
upon
trunks
in
the
*NL*
hall
,
making
fun
of
the
procession
which
filed
by
them
.
They
were
noisy
*NL*
and
hilarious
,
and
had
evidently
been
drinking
;
one
of
them
,
who
wore
a
*NL*
bright
red
kimono
,
shouted
and
screamed
in
a
voice
that
drowned
out
all
*NL*
the
other
sounds
in
the
hall
--
and
Jurgis
took
a
glance
at
her
,
and
then
*NL*
gave
a
start
,
and
a
cry
,
``
Marija
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
heard
him
,
and
glanced
around
;
then
she
shrank
back
and
half
sprang
*NL*
to
her
feet
in
amazement
.
``
Jurgis
!
''
she
gasped
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
second
or
two
they
stood
staring
at
each
other
.
``
How
did
you
come
*NL*
here
?
''
Marija
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
came
to
see
you
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
did
you
know
--
who
told
you
I
was
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alena
Jasaityte
.
I
met
her
on
the
street
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
there
was
a
silence
,
while
they
gazed
at
each
other
.
The
rest
of
*NL*
the
crowd
was
watching
them
,
and
so
Marija
got
up
and
came
closer
to
*NL*
him
.
``
And
you
?
''
Jurgis
asked
.
``
You
live
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Marija
,
``
I
live
here
.
''
Then
suddenly
came
a
hail
from
below
:
*NL*
``
Get
your
clothes
on
now
,
girls
,
and
come
along
.
You
'd
best
begin
,
or
*NL*
you
'll
be
sorry
--
it
's
raining
outside
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Br-r-r
!
''
shivered
some
one
,
and
the
women
got
up
and
entered
the
*NL*
various
doors
which
lined
the
hallway
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
''
said
Marija
,
and
took
Jurgis
into
her
room
,
which
was
a
tiny
*NL*
place
about
eight
by
six
,
with
a
cot
and
a
chair
and
a
dressing
stand
*NL*
and
some
dresses
hanging
behind
the
door
.
There
were
clothes
scattered
*NL*
about
on
the
floor
,
and
hopeless
confusion
everywhere
--
boxes
of
rouge
*NL*
and
bottles
of
perfume
mixed
with
hats
and
soiled
dishes
on
the
dresser
,
*NL*
and
a
pair
of
slippers
and
a
clock
and
a
whisky
bottle
on
a
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marija
had
nothing
on
but
a
kimono
and
a
pair
of
stockings
;
yet
she
*NL*
proceeded
to
dress
before
Jurgis
,
and
without
even
taking
the
trouble
to
*NL*
close
the
door
.
He
had
by
this
time
divined
what
sort
of
a
place
he
was
*NL*
in
;
and
he
had
seen
a
great
deal
of
the
world
since
he
had
left
home
,
*NL*
and
was
not
easy
to
shock
--
and
yet
it
gave
him
a
painful
start
that
*NL*
Marija
should
do
this
.
They
had
always
been
decent
people
at
home
,
and
*NL*
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
memory
of
old
times
ought
to
have
ruled
her
.
*NL*
But
then
he
laughed
at
himself
for
a
fool
.
What
was
he
,
to
be
pretending
*NL*
to
decency
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
long
have
you
been
living
here
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nearly
a
year
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
you
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
to
live
,
''
she
said
;
``
and
I
could
n't
see
the
children
starve
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
for
a
moment
,
watching
her
.
``
You
were
out
of
work
?
''
he
asked
,
*NL*
finally
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
got
sick
,
''
she
replied
,
``
and
after
that
I
had
no
money
.
And
then
*NL*
Stanislovas
died
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stanislovas
dead
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Marija
,
``
I
forgot
.
You
did
n't
know
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
did
he
die
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rats
killed
him
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
gave
a
gasp
.
``
Rats
killed
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
the
other
;
she
was
bending
over
,
lacing
her
shoes
as
she
*NL*
spoke
.
``
He
was
working
in
an
oil
factory
--
at
least
he
was
hired
by
the
*NL*
men
to
get
their
beer
.
He
used
to
carry
cans
on
a
long
pole
;
and
he
'd
*NL*
drink
a
little
out
of
each
can
,
and
one
day
he
drank
too
much
,
and
fell
*NL*
asleep
in
a
corner
,
and
got
locked
up
in
the
place
all
night
.
When
they
*NL*
found
him
the
rats
had
killed
him
and
eaten
him
nearly
all
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
sat
,
frozen
with
horror
.
Marija
went
on
lacing
up
her
shoes
.
*NL*
There
was
a
long
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
a
big
policeman
came
to
the
door
.
``
Hurry
up
,
there
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
quick
as
I
can
,
''
said
Marija
,
and
she
stood
up
and
began
putting
on
*NL*
her
corsets
with
feverish

*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
the
rest
of
the
people
alive
?
''
asked
Jurgis
,
finally
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
they
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
live
not
far
from
here

They
're
all
right
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
working
?
''
he
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Elzbieta
is
,
''
said
Marija
,
``
when
she
can
.
I
take
care
of
them
most
of
*NL*
the
time
--
I
'm
making
plenty
of
money
now

''
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
was
silent
for
a
moment
.
``
Do
they
know
you
live
here
--
how
you
*NL*
live
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Elzbieta
knows
,
''
answered
Marija
.
``
I
could
n't
lie
to
her
.
And
maybe
the
*NL*
children
have
found
out
by
this
time
.
It
's
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
--
we
*NL*
ca
n't
help
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Tamoszius
?
''
he
asked
.
``
Does
he
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marija
shrugged
her
shoulders
.
``
How
do
I
know
?
''
she
said
.
``
I
have
n't
*NL*
seen
him
for
over
a
year
.
He
got
blood
poisoning
and
lost
one
finger
,
*NL*
and
could
n't
play
the
violin
any
more
;
and
then
he
went
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marija
was
standing
in
front
of
the
glass
fastening
her
dress
.
Jurgis
*NL*
sat
staring
at
her
.
He
could
hardly
believe
that
she
was
the
same
woman
*NL*
he
had
known
in
the
old
days
;
she
was
so
quiet
--
so
hard
!
It
struck
fear
*NL*
to
his
heart
to
watch
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
suddenly
she
gave
a
glance
at
him
.
``
You
look
as
if
you
had
been
*NL*
having
a
rough
time
of
it
yourself
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
,
''
he
answered
.
``
I
have
n't
a
cent
in
my
pockets
,
and
nothing
to
*NL*
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
have
you
been
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
over
.
I
've
been
hoboing
it
.
Then
I
went
back
to
the
yards
--
just
*NL*
before
the
strike
.
''
He
paused
for
a
moment
,
hesitating
.
``
I
asked
for
*NL*
you
,
''
he
added
.
``
I
found
you
had
gone
away
,
no
one
knew
where
.
Perhaps
*NL*
you
think
I
did
you
a
dirty
trick
running
away
as
I
did
,
Marija
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
answered
,
``
I
do
n't
blame
you
.
We
never
have
--
any
of
us
.
You
*NL*
did
your
best
--
the
job
was
too
much
for
us
.
''
She
paused
a
moment
,
then
*NL*
added
:
``
We
were
too
ignorant
--
that
was
the
trouble
.
We
did
n't
stand
any
*NL*
chance
.
If
I
'd
known
what
I
know
now
we
'd
have
won
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
have
come
here
?
''
said
Jurgis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
answered
;
``
but
that
's
not
what
I
meant
.
I
meant
you
--
how
*NL*
differently
you
would
have
behaved
--
about
Ona
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
was
silent
;
he
had
never
thought
of
that
aspect
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
people
are
starving
,
''
the
other
continued
,
``
and
they
have
anything
*NL*
with
a
price
,
they
ought
to
sell
it
,
I
say
.
I
guess
you
realize
it
*NL*
now
when
it
's
too
late
.
Ona
could
have
taken
care
of
us
all
,
in
the
*NL*
beginning
.
''
Marija
spoke
without
emotion
,
as
one
who
had
come
to
regard
*NL*
things
from
the
business
point
of
view
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
--
yes
,
I
guess
so
,
''
Jurgis
answered
hesitatingly
.
He
did
not
add
*NL*
that
he
had
paid
three
hundred
dollars
,
and
a
foreman
's
job
,
for
the
*NL*
satisfaction
of
knocking
down
``
Phil
''
Connor
a
second
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
policeman
came
to
the
door
again
just
then
.
``
Come
on
,
now
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
``
Lively
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
said
Marija
,
reaching
for
her
hat
,
which
was
big
enough
to
*NL*
be
a
drum
major
's
,
and
full
of
ostrich
feathers
.
She
went
out
into
the
*NL*
hall
and
Jurgis
followed
,
the
policeman
remaining
to
look
under
the
bed
*NL*
and
behind
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
going
to
come
of
this
?
''
Jurgis
asked
,
as
they
started
down
the
*NL*
steps
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
raid
,
you
mean
?
Oh
,
nothing
--
it
happens
to
us
every
now
and
then
.
*NL*
The
madame
's
having
some
sort
of
time
with
the
police
;
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
what
it
is
,
but
maybe
they
'll
come
to
terms
before
morning
.
Anyhow
,
they
*NL*
wo
n't
do
anything
to
you
.
They
always
let
the
men
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maybe
so
,
''
he
responded
,
``
but
not
me
--
I
'm
afraid
I
'm
in
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
wanted
by
the
police
,
''
he
said
,
lowering
his
voice
,
though
of
*NL*
course
their
conversation
was
in
Lithuanian
.
``
They
'll
send
me
up
for
a
*NL*
year
or
two
,
I
'm
afraid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hell
!
''
said
Marija
.
``
That
's
too
bad
.
I
'll
see
if
I
ca
n't
get
you
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Downstairs
,
where
the
greater
part
of
the
prisoners
were
now
massed
,
she
*NL*
sought
out
the
stout
personage
with
the
diamond
earrings
,
and
had
a
few
*NL*
whispered
words
with
her
.
The
latter
then
approached
the
police
sergeant
*NL*
who
was
in
charge
of
the
raid
.
``
Billy
,
''
she
said
,
pointing
to
Jurgis
,
*NL*
``
there
's
a
fellow
who
came
in
to
see
his
sister
.
He
'd
just
got
in
the
*NL*
door
when
you
knocked
.
You
are
n't
taking
hoboes
,
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sergeant
laughed
as
he
looked
at
Jurgis
.
``
Sorry
,
''
he
said
,
``
but
the
*NL*
orders
are
every
one
but
the
servants
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
Jurgis
slunk
in
among
the
rest
of
the
men
,
who
kept
dodging
behind
*NL*
each
other
like
sheep
that
have
smelled
a
wolf
.
There
were
old
men
*NL*
and
young
men
,
college
boys
and
gray-beards
old
enough
to
be
their
*NL*
grandfathers
;
some
of
them
wore
evening
dress
--
there
was
no
one
among
*NL*
them
save
Jurgis
who
showed
any
signs
of
poverty
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
roundup
was
completed
,
the
doors
were
opened
and
the
party
*NL*
marched
out
.
Three
patrol
wagons
were
drawn
up
at
the
curb
,
and
the
*NL*
whole
neighborhood
had
turned
out
to
see
the
sport
;
there
was
much
*NL*
chaffing
,
and
a
universal
craning
of
necks
.
The
women
stared
about
them
*NL*
with
defiant
eyes
,
or
laughed
and
joked
,
while
the
men
kept
their
heads
*NL*
bowed
,
and
their
hats
pulled
over
their
faces
.
They
were
crowded
into
*NL*
the
patrol
wagons
as
if
into
streetcars
,
and
then
off
they
went
amid
a
*NL*
din
of
cheers
.
At
the
station
house
Jurgis
gave
a
Polish
name
and
was
*NL*
put
into
a
cell
with
half
a
dozen
others
;
and
while
these
sat
and
*NL*
talked
in
whispers
,
he
lay
down
in
a
corner
and
gave
himself
up
to
his
*NL*
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
had
looked
into
the
deepest
reaches
of
the
social
pit
,
and
grown
*NL*
used
to
the
sights
in
them
.
Yet
when
he
had
thought
of
all
humanity
as
*NL*
vile
and
hideous
,
he
had
somehow
always
excepted
his
own
family
that
he
*NL*
had
loved
;
and
now
this
sudden
horrible
discovery
--
Marija
a
whore
,
and
*NL*
Elzbieta
and
the
children
living
off
her
shame
!
Jurgis
might
argue
*NL*
with
himself
all
he
chose
,
that
he
had
done
worse
,
and
was
a
fool
*NL*
for
caring
--
but
still
he
could
not
get
over
the
shock
of
that
sudden
*NL*
unveiling
,
he
could
not
help
being
sunk
in
grief
because
of
it
.
The
*NL*
depths
of
him
were
troubled
and
shaken
,
memories
were
stirred
in
him
*NL*
that
had
been
sleeping
so
long
he
had
counted
them
dead
.
Memories
of
the
*NL*
old
life
--
his
old
hopes
and
his
old
yearnings
,
his
old
dreams
of
decency
*NL*
and
independence
!
He
saw
Ona
again
,
he
heard
her
gentle
voice
pleading
*NL*
with
him
.
He
saw
little
Antanas
,
whom
he
had
meant
to
make
a
man
.
He
saw
*NL*
his
trembling
old
father
,
who
had
blessed
them
all
with
his
wonderful
*NL*
love
.
He
lived
again
through
that
day
of
horror
when
he
had
discovered
*NL*
Ona
's
shame
--
God
,
how
he
had
suffered
,
what
a
madman
he
had
been
!
*NL*
How
dreadful
it
had
all
seemed
to
him
;
and
now
,
today
,
he
had
sat
and
*NL*
listened
,
and
half
agreed
when
Marija
told
him
he
had
been
a
fool
!
*NL*
Yes
--
told
him
that
he
ought
to
have
sold
his
wife
's
honor
and
lived
by
*NL*
it
!
--
And
then
there
was
Stanislovas
and
his
awful
fate
--
that
brief
story
*NL*
which
Marija
had
narrated
so
calmly
,
with
such
dull
indifference
!
The
*NL*
poor
little
fellow
,
with
his
frostbitten
fingers
and
his
terror
of
the
*NL*
snow
--
his
wailing
voice
rang
in
Jurgis
's
ears
,
as
he
lay
there
in
the
*NL*
darkness
,
until
the
sweat
started
on
his
forehead
.
Now
and
then
he
*NL*
would
quiver
with
a
sudden
spasm
of
horror
,
at
the
picture
of
little
*NL*
Stanislovas
shut
up
in
the
deserted
building
and
fighting
for
his
life
*NL*
with
the
rats
!
*NL*
*NL*
All
these
emotions
had
become
strangers
to
the
soul
of
Jurgis
;
it
was
so
*NL*
long
since
they
had
troubled
him
that
he
had
ceased
to
think
they
might
*NL*
ever
trouble
him
again
.
Helpless
,
trapped
,
as
he
was
,
what
good
did
they
*NL*
do
him
--
why
should
he
ever
have
allowed
them
to
torment
him
?
It
had
been
*NL*
the
task
of
his
recent
life
to
fight
them
down
,
to
crush
them
out
of
*NL*
him
;
never
in
his
life
would
he
have
suffered
from
them
again
,
save
*NL*
that
they
had
caught
him
unawares
,
and
overwhelmed
him
before
he
could
*NL*
protect
himself
.
He
heard
the
old
voices
of
his
soul
,
he
saw
its
old
*NL*
ghosts
beckoning
to
him
,
stretching
out
their
arms
to
him
!
But
they
were
*NL*
far-off
and
shadowy
,
and
the
gulf
between
them
was
black
and
bottomless
;
*NL*
they
would
fade
away
into
the
mists
of
the
past
once
more
.
Their
voices
*NL*
would
die
,
and
never
again
would
he
hear
them
--
and
so
the
last
faint
*NL*
spark
of
manhood
in
his
soul
would
flicker
out
.

Chapter
28
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
After
breakfast
Jurgis
was
driven
to
the
court
,
which
was
crowded
with
*NL*
the
prisoners
and
those
who
had
come
out
of
curiosity
or
in
the
hope
*NL*
of
recognizing
one
of
the
men
and
getting
a
case
for
blackmail
.
The
men
*NL*
were
called
up
first
,
and
reprimanded
in
a
bunch
,
and
then
dismissed
;
*NL*
but
,
Jurgis
,
to
his
terror
,
was
called
separately
,
as
being
a
*NL*
suspicious-looking
case
.
It
was
in
this
very
same
court
that
he
had
been
*NL*
tried
,
that
time
when
his
sentence
had
been
``
suspended
''
;
it
was
the
same
*NL*
judge
,
and
the
same
clerk
.
The
latter
now
stared
at
Jurgis
,
as
if
he
*NL*
half
thought
that
he
knew
him
;
but
the
judge
had
no
suspicions
--
just
*NL*
then
his
thoughts
were
upon
a
telephone
message
he
was
expecting
from
a
*NL*
friend
of
the
police
captain
of
the
district
,
telling
what
disposition
*NL*
he
should
make
of
the
case
of
``
Polly
''
Simpson
,
as
the
``
madame
''
of
the
*NL*
house
was
known
.
Meantime
,
he
listened
to
the
story
of
how
Jurgis
had
*NL*
been
looking
for
his
sister
,
and
advised
him
dryly
to
keep
his
sister
*NL*
in
a
better
place
;
then
he
let
him
go
,
and
proceeded
to
fine
each
of
the
*NL*
girls
five
dollars
,
which
fines
were
paid
in
a
bunch
from
a
wad
of
bills
*NL*
which
Madame
Polly
extracted
from
her
stocking
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
waited
outside
and
walked
home
with
Marija
.
The
police
had
left
*NL*
the
house
,
and
already
there
were
a
few
visitors
;
by
evening
the
place
*NL*
would
be
running
again
,
exactly
as
if
nothing
had
happened
.
Meantime
,
*NL*
Marija
took
Jurgis
upstairs
to
her
room
,
and
they
sat
and
talked
.
By
*NL*
daylight
,
Jurgis
was
able
to
observe
that
the
color
on
her
cheeks
was
*NL*
not
the
old
natural
one
of
abounding
health
;
her
complexion
was
in
*NL*
reality
a
parchment
yellow
,
and
there
were
black
rings
under
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
been
sick
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sick
?
''
she
said
.
``
Hell
!
''
-LRB-
Marija
had
learned
to
scatter
her
*NL*
conversation
with
as
many
oaths
as
a
longshoreman
or
a
mule
driver
.
-RRB-
*NL*
``
How
can
I
ever
be
anything
but
sick
,
at
this
life
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
fell
silent
for
a
moment
,
staring
ahead
of
her
gloomily
.
``
It
's
*NL*
morphine
,
''
she
said
,
at
last
.
``
I
seem
to
take
more
of
it
every
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
that
for
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
the
way
of
it
;
I
do
n't
know
why
.
If
it
is
n't
that
,
it
's
drink
.
If
*NL*
the
girls
did
n't
booze
they
could
n't
stand
it
any
time
at
all
.
And
the
*NL*
madame
always
gives
them
dope
when
they
first
come
,
and
they
learn
to
*NL*
like
it
;
or
else
they
take
it
for
headaches
and
such
things
,
and
get
*NL*
the
habit
that
way
.
I
've
got
it
,
I
know
;
I
've
tried
to
quit
,
but
I
never
*NL*
will
while
I
'm
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
long
are
you
going
to
stay
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
she
said
.
``
Always
,
I
guess
.
What
else
could
I
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
save
any
money
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Save
!
''
said
Marija
.
``
Good
Lord
,
no
!
I
get
enough
,
I
suppose
,
but
it
all
*NL*
goes
.
I
get
a
half
share
,
two
dollars
and
a
half
for
each
customer
,
and
*NL*
sometimes
I
make
twenty-five
or
thirty
dollars
a
night
,
and
you
'd
think
*NL*
I
ought
to
save
something
out
of
that
!
But
then
I
am
charged
for
my
*NL*
room
and
my
meals
--
and
such
prices
as
you
never
heard
of
;
and
then
for
*NL*
extras
,
and
drinks
--
for
everything
I
get
,
and
some
I
do
n't
.
My
laundry
*NL*
bill
is
nearly
twenty
dollars
each
week
alone
--
think
of
that
!
Yet
what
*NL*
can
I
do
?
I
either
have
to
stand
it
or
quit
,
and
it
would
be
the
same
*NL*
anywhere
else
.
It
's
all
I
can
do
to
save
the
fifteen
dollars
I
give
*NL*
Elzbieta
each
week
,
so
the
children
can
go
to
school
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marija
sat
brooding
in
silence
for
a
while
;
then
,
seeing
that
Jurgis
was
*NL*
interested
,
she
went
on
:
``
That
's
the
way
they
keep
the
girls
--
they
*NL*
let
them
run
up
debts
,
so
they
ca
n't
get
away
.
A
young
girl
comes
from
*NL*
abroad
,
and
she
does
n't
know
a
word
of
English
,
and
she
gets
into
a
*NL*
place
like
this
,
and
when
she
wants
to
go
the
madame
shows
her
that
she
*NL*
is
a
couple
of
hundred
dollars
in
debt
,
and
takes
all
her
clothes
away
,
*NL*
and
threatens
to
have
her
arrested
if
she
does
n't
stay
and
do
as
she
's
*NL*
told
.
So
she
stays
,
and
the
longer
she
stays
,
the
more
in
debt
she
gets
.
*NL*
Often
,
too
,
they
are
girls
that
did
n't
know
what
they
were
coming
to
,
*NL*
that
had
hired
out
for
housework
.
Did
you
notice
that
little
French
girl
*NL*
with
the
yellow
hair
,
that
stood
next
to
me
in
the
court
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
answered
in
the
affirmative
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
she
came
to
America
about
a
year
ago
.
She
was
a
store
clerk
,
and
*NL*
she
hired
herself
to
a
man
to
be
sent
here
to
work
in
a
factory
.
There
*NL*
were
six
of
them
,
all
together
,
and
they
were
brought
to
a
house
just
*NL*
down
the
street
from
here
,
and
this
girl
was
put
into
a
room
alone
,
and
*NL*
they
gave
her
some
dope
in
her
food
,
and
when
she
came
to
she
found
that
*NL*
she
had
been
ruined
.
She
cried
,
and
screamed
,
and
tore
her
hair
,
but
she
*NL*
had
nothing
but
a
wrapper
,
and
could
n't
get
away
,
and
they
kept
her
half
*NL*
insensible
with
drugs
all
the
time
,
until
she
gave
up
.
She
never
got
*NL*
outside
of
that
place
for
ten
months
,
and
then
they
sent
her
away
,
*NL*
because
she
did
n't
suit
.
I
guess
they
'll
put
her
out
of
here
,
too
--
she
's
*NL*
getting
to
have
crazy
fits
,
from
drinking
absinthe
.
Only
one
of
*NL*
the
girls
that
came
out
with
her
got
away
,
and
she
jumped
out
of
a
*NL*
second-story
window
one
night
.
There
was
a
great
fuss
about
that
--
maybe
*NL*
you
heard
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
,
''
said
Jurgis
,
``
I
heard
of
it
afterward
.
''
-LRB-
It
had
happened
in
the
*NL*
place
where
he
and
Duane
had
taken
refuge
from
their
``
country
customer
.
''
*NL*
The
girl
had
become
insane
,
fortunately
for
the
police
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
lots
of
money
in
it
,
''
said
Marija
--
``
they
get
as
much
as
forty
*NL*
dollars
a
head
for
girls
,
and
they
bring
them
from
all
over
.
There
are
*NL*
seventeen
in
this
place
,
and
nine
different
countries
among
them
.
*NL*
In
some
places
you
might
find
even
more
.
We
have
half
a
dozen
French
*NL*
girls
--
I
suppose
it
's
because
the
madame
speaks
the
language
.
French
*NL*
girls
are
bad
,
too
,
the
worst
of
all
,
except
for
the
Japanese
.
There
's
*NL*
a
place
next
door
that
's
full
of
Japanese
women
,
but
I
would
n't
live
in
*NL*
the
same
house
with
one
of
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marija
paused
for
a
moment
or
two
,
and
then
she
added
:
``
Most
of
the
*NL*
women
here
are
pretty
decent
--
you
'd
be
surprised
.
I
used
to
think
they
*NL*
did
it
because
they
liked
to
;
but
fancy
a
woman
selling
herself
to
*NL*
every
kind
of
man
that
comes
,
old
or
young
,
black
or
white
--
and
doing
it
*NL*
because
she
likes
to
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
of
them
say
they
do
,
''
said
Jurgis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
,
''
said
she
;
``
they
say
anything
.
They
're
in
,
and
they
know
they
*NL*
ca
n't
get
out
.
But
they
did
n't
like
it
when
they
began
--
you
'd
find
*NL*
out
--
it
's
always
misery
!
There
's
a
little
Jewish
girl
here
who
used
to
*NL*
run
errands
for
a
milliner
,
and
got
sick
and
lost
her
place
;
and
she
was
*NL*
four
days
on
the
streets
without
a
mouthful
of
food
,
and
then
she
went
*NL*
to
a
place
just
around
the
corner
and
offered
herself
,
and
they
made
her
*NL*
give
up
her
clothes
before
they
would
give
her
a
bite
to
eat
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marija
sat
for
a
minute
or
two
,
brooding
somberly
.
``
Tell
me
about
*NL*
yourself
,
Jurgis
,
''
she
said
,
suddenly
.
``
Where
have
you
been
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
told
her
the
long
story
of
his
adventures
since
his
flight
from
*NL*
home
;
his
life
as
a
tramp
,
and
his
work
in
the
freight
tunnels
,
and
the
*NL*
accident
;
and
then
of
Jack
Duane
,
and
of
his
political
career
in
the
*NL*
stockyards
,
and
his
downfall
and
subsequent
failures
.
Marija
listened
*NL*
with
sympathy
;
it
was
easy
to
believe
the
tale
of
his
late
starvation
,
*NL*
for
his
face
showed
it
all
.
``
You
found
me
just
in
the
nick
of
time
,
''
she
*NL*
said
.
``
I
'll
stand
by
you
--
I
'll
help
you
till
you
can
get
some
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
like
to
let
you
--
''
he
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
Because
I
'm
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
not
that
,
''
he
said
.
``
But
I
went
off
and
left
you
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
!
''
said
Marija
.
``
Do
n't
think
about
it
.
I
do
n't
blame
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
be
hungry
,
''
she
said
,
after
a
minute
or
two
.
``
You
stay
here
to
*NL*
lunch
--
I
'll
have
something
up
in
the
room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
pressed
a
button
,
and
a
colored
woman
came
to
the
door
and
took
her
*NL*
order
.
``
It
's
nice
to
have
somebody
to
wait
on
you
,
''
she
observed
,
with
a
*NL*
laugh
,
as
she
lay
back
on
the
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
prison
breakfast
had
not
been
liberal
,
Jurgis
had
a
good
*NL*
appetite
,
and
they
had
a
little
feast
together
,
talking
meanwhile
*NL*
of
Elzbieta
and
the
children
and
old
times
.
Shortly
before
they
were
*NL*
through
,
there
came
another
colored
girl
,
with
the
message
that
the
*NL*
``
madame
''
wanted
Marija
--
``
Lithuanian
Mary
,
''
as
they
called
her
here
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
means
you
have
to
go
,
''
she
said
to
Jurgis
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
got
up
,
and
she
gave
him
the
new
address
of
the
family
,
a
tenement
*NL*
over
in
the
Ghetto
district
.
``
You
go
there
,
''
she
said
.
``
They
'll
be
glad
*NL*
to
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Jurgis
stood
hesitating
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
--
I
do
n't
like
to
,
''
he
said
.
``
Honest
,
Marija
,
why
do
n't
you
just
give
*NL*
me
a
little
money
and
let
me
look
for
work
first
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
need
money
?
''
was
her
reply
.
``
All
you
want
is
something
to
*NL*
eat
and
a
place
to
sleep
,
is
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
said
;
``
but
then
I
do
n't
like
to
go
there
after
I
left
*NL*
them
--
and
while
I
have
nothing
to
do
,
and
while
you
--
you
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
on
!
''
said
Marija
,
giving
him
a
push
.
``
What
are
you
talking
?
--
I
wo
n't
*NL*
give
you
money
,
''
she
added
,
as
she
followed
him
to
the
door
,
``
because
*NL*
you
'll
drink
it
up
,
and
do
yourself
harm
.
Here
's
a
quarter
for
you
now
,
*NL*
and
go
along
,
and
they
'll
be
so
glad
to
have
you
back
,
you
wo
n't
have
*NL*
time
to
feel
ashamed
.
Good-by
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
So
Jurgis
went
out
,
and
walked
down
the
street
to
think
it
over
.
He
*NL*
decided
that
he
would
first
try
to
get
work
,
and
so
he
put
in
the
rest
*NL*
of
the
day
wandering
here
and
there
among
factories
and
warehouses
*NL*
without
success
.
Then
,
when
it
was
nearly
dark
,
he
concluded
to
go
home
,
*NL*
and
set
out
;
but
he
came
to
a
restaurant
,
and
went
in
and
spent
his
*NL*
quarter
for
a
meal
;
and
when
he
came
out
he
changed
his
mind
--
the
night
*NL*
was
pleasant
,
and
he
would
sleep
somewhere
outside
,
and
put
in
the
*NL*
morrow
hunting
,
and
so
have
one
more
chance
of
a
job
.
So
he
started
away
*NL*
again
,
when
suddenly
he
chanced
to
look
about
him
,
and
found
that
he
*NL*
was
walking
down
the
same
street
and
past
the
same
hall
where
he
had
*NL*
listened
to
the
political
speech
the
night
before
.
There
was
no
red
*NL*
fire
and
no
band
now
,
but
there
was
a
sign
out
,
announcing
a
meeting
,
*NL*
and
a
stream
of
people
pouring
in
through
the
entrance
.
In
a
flash
*NL*
Jurgis
had
decided
that
he
would
chance
it
once
more
,
and
sit
down
*NL*
and
rest
while
making
up
his
mind
what
to
do
.
There
was
no
one
taking
*NL*
tickets
,
so
it
must
be
a
free
show
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
entered
.
There
were
no
decorations
in
the
hall
this
time
;
but
there
*NL*
was
quite
a
crowd
upon
the
platform
,
and
almost
every
seat
in
the
place
*NL*
was
filled
.
He
took
one
of
the
last
,
far
in
the
rear
,
and
straightway
*NL*
forgot
all
about
his
surroundings
.
Would
Elzbieta
think
that
he
had
come
*NL*
to
sponge
off
her
,
or
would
she
understand
that
he
meant
to
get
to
work
*NL*
again
and
do
his
share
?
Would
she
be
decent
to
him
,
or
would
she
scold
*NL*
him
?
If
only
he
could
get
some
sort
of
a
job
before
he
went
--
if
that
*NL*
last
boss
had
only
been
willing
to
try
him
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
Then
suddenly
Jurgis
looked
up
.
A
tremendous
roar
had
burst
from
the
*NL*
throats
of
the
crowd
,
which
by
this
time
had
packed
the
hall
to
the
very
*NL*
doors
.
Men
and
women
were
standing
up
,
waving
handkerchiefs
,
shouting
,
*NL*
yelling
.
Evidently
the
speaker
had
arrived
,
thought
Jurgis
;
what
fools
*NL*
they
were
making
of
themselves
!
What
were
they
expecting
to
get
out
*NL*
of
it
anyhow
--
what
had
they
to
do
with
elections
,
with
governing
the
*NL*
country
?
Jurgis
had
been
behind
the
scenes
in
politics
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
back
to
his
thoughts
,
but
with
one
further
fact
to
reckon
*NL*
with
--
that
he
was
caught
here
.
The
hall
was
now
filled
to
the
doors
;
and
*NL*
after
the
meeting
it
would
be
too
late
for
him
to
go
home
,
so
he
would
*NL*
have
to
make
the
best
of
it
outside
.
Perhaps
it
would
be
better
to
go
*NL*
home
in
the
morning
,
anyway
,
for
the
children
would
be
at
school
,
and
*NL*
he
and
Elzbieta
could
have
a
quiet
explanation
.
She
always
had
been
a
*NL*
reasonable
person
;
and
he
really
did
mean
to
do
right
.
He
would
manage
*NL*
to
persuade
her
of
it
--
and
besides
,
Marija
was
willing
,
and
Marija
was
*NL*
furnishing
the
money
.
If
Elzbieta
were
ugly
,
he
would
tell
her
that
in
*NL*
so
many
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
Jurgis
went
on
meditating
;
until
finally
,
when
he
had
been
an
hour
*NL*
or
two
in
the
hall
,
there
began
to
prepare
itself
a
repetition
of
the
*NL*
dismal
catastrophe
of
the
night
before
.
Speaking
had
been
going
on
*NL*
all
the
time
,
and
the
audience
was
clapping
its
hands
and
shouting
,
*NL*
thrilling
with
excitement
;
and
little
by
little
the
sounds
were
*NL*
beginning
to
blur
in
Jurgis
's
ears
,
and
his
thoughts
were
beginning
to
*NL*
run
together
,
and
his
head
to
wobble
and
nod
.
He
caught
himself
many
*NL*
times
,
as
usual
,
and
made
desperate
resolutions
;
but
the
hall
was
hot
*NL*
and
close
,
and
his
long
walk
and
is
dinner
were
too
much
for
him
--
in
the
*NL*
end
his
head
sank
forward
and
he
went
off
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
again
someone
nudged
him
,
and
he
sat
up
with
his
old
terrified
*NL*
start
!
He
had
been
snoring
again
,
of
course
!
And
now
what
?
He
fixed
his
*NL*
eyes
ahead
of
him
,
with
painful
intensity
,
staring
at
the
platform
as
*NL*
if
nothing
else
ever
had
interested
him
,
or
ever
could
interest
him
,
all
*NL*
his
life
.
He
imagined
the
angry
exclamations
,
the
hostile
glances
;
he
*NL*
imagined
the
policeman
striding
toward
him
--
reaching
for
his
neck
.
Or
*NL*
was
he
to
have
one
more
chance
?
Were
they
going
to
let
him
alone
this
*NL*
time
?
He
sat
trembling
;
waiting
--
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
suddenly
came
a
voice
in
his
ear
,
a
woman
's
voice
,
gentle
*NL*
and
sweet
,
``
If
you
would
try
to
listen
,
comrade
,
perhaps
you
would
be
*NL*
interested
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
was
more
startled
by
that
than
he
would
have
been
by
the
touch
of
*NL*
a
policeman
.
He
still
kept
his
eyes
fixed
ahead
,
and
did
not
stir
;
*NL*
but
his
heart
gave
a
great
leap
.
Comrade
!
Who
was
it
that
called
him
*NL*
``
comrade
''
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
waited
long
,
long
;
and
at
last
,
when
he
was
sure
that
he
was
no
*NL*
longer
watched
,
he
stole
a
glance
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eyes
at
the
*NL*
woman
who
sat
beside
him
.
She
was
young
and
beautiful
;
she
wore
fine
*NL*
clothes
,
and
was
what
is
called
a
``
lady
.
''
And
she
called
him
``
comrade
''
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
a
little
,
carefully
,
so
that
he
could
see
her
better
;
then
he
*NL*
began
to
watch
her
,
fascinated
.
She
had
apparently
forgotten
all
*NL*
about
him
,
and
was
looking
toward
the
platform
.
A
man
was
speaking
*NL*
there
--
Jurgis
heard
his
voice
vaguely
;
but
all
his
thoughts
were
for
*NL*
this
woman
's
face
.
A
feeling
of
alarm
stole
over
him
as
he
stared
at
*NL*
her
.
It
made
his
flesh
creep
.
What
was
the
matter
with
her
,
what
could
*NL*
be
going
on
,
to
affect
any
one
like
that
?
She
sat
as
one
turned
to
*NL*
stone
,
her
hands
clenched
tightly
in
her
lap
,
so
tightly
that
he
could
*NL*
see
the
cords
standing
out
in
her
wrists
.
There
was
a
look
of
excitement
*NL*
upon
her
face
,
of
tense
effort
,
as
of
one
struggling
mightily
,
or
*NL*
witnessing
a
struggle
.
There
was
a
faint
quivering
of
her
nostrils
;
and
*NL*
now
and
then
she
would
moisten
her
lips
with
feverish
haste
.
Her
bosom
*NL*
rose
and
fell
as
she
breathed
,
and
her
excitement
seemed
to
mount
higher
*NL*
and
higher
,
and
then
to
sink
away
again
,
like
a
boat
tossing
upon
ocean
*NL*
surges
.
What
was
it
?
What
was
the
matter
?
It
must
be
something
that
the
*NL*
man
was
saying
,
up
there
on
the
platform
.
What
sort
of
a
man
was
he
?
*NL*
And
what
sort
of
thing
was
this
,
anyhow
?
--
So
all
at
once
it
occurred
to
*NL*
Jurgis
to
look
at
the
speaker
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
like
coming
suddenly
upon
some
wild
sight
of
nature
--
a
mountain
*NL*
forest
lashed
by
a
tempest
,
a
ship
tossed
about
upon
a
stormy
sea
.
*NL*
Jurgis
had
an
unpleasant
sensation
,
a
sense
of
confusion
,
of
disorder
,
*NL*
of
wild
and
meaningless
uproar
.
The
man
was
tall
and
gaunt
,
as
haggard
*NL*
as
his
auditor
himself
;
a
thin
black
beard
covered
half
of
his
face
,
*NL*
and
one
could
see
only
two
black
hollows
where
the
eyes
were
.
He
was
*NL*
speaking
rapidly
,
in
great
excitement
;
he
used
many
gestures
--
as
he
spoke
*NL*
he
moved
here
and
there
upon
the
stage
,
reaching
with
his
long
arms
as
*NL*
if
to
seize
each
person
in
his
audience
.
His
voice
was
deep
,
like
an
*NL*
organ
;
it
was
some
time
,
however
,
before
Jurgis
thought
of
the
voice
--
he
*NL*
was
too
much
occupied
with
his
eyes
to
think
of
what
the
man
was
saying
.
*NL*
But
suddenly
it
seemed
as
if
the
speaker
had
begun
pointing
straight
at
*NL*
him
,
as
if
he
had
singled
him
out
particularly
for
his
remarks
;
and
*NL*
so
Jurgis
became
suddenly
aware
of
his
voice
,
trembling
,
vibrant
with
*NL*
emotion
,
with
pain
and
longing
,
with
a
burden
of
things
unutterable
,
not
*NL*
to
be
compassed
by
words
.
To
hear
it
was
to
be
suddenly
arrested
,
to
be
*NL*
gripped
,
transfixed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
listen
to
these
things
,
''
the
man
was
saying
,
``
and
you
say
,
`
Yes
,
*NL*
they
are
true
,
but
they
have
been
that
way
always
.
'
Or
you
say
,
`
Maybe
*NL*
it
will
come
,
but
not
in
my
time
--
it
will
not
help
me
.
'
And
so
you
*NL*
return
to
your
daily
round
of
toil
,
you
go
back
to
be
ground
up
for
*NL*
profits
in
the
world-wide
mill
of
economic
might
!
To
toil
long
hours
*NL*
for
another
's
advantage
;
to
live
in
mean
and
squalid
homes
,
to
work
in
*NL*
dangerous
and
unhealthful
places
;
to
wrestle
with
the
specters
of
hunger
*NL*
and
privation
,
to
take
your
chances
of
accident
,
disease
,
and
death
.
And
*NL*
each
day
the
struggle
becomes
fiercer
,
the
pace
more
cruel
;
each
day
*NL*
you
have
to
toil
a
little
harder
,
and
feel
the
iron
hand
of
circumstance
*NL*
close
upon
you
a
little
tighter
.
Months
pass
,
years
maybe
--
and
then
you
*NL*
come
again
;
and
again
I
am
here
to
plead
with
you
,
to
know
if
want
and
*NL*
misery
have
yet
done
their
work
with
you
,
if
injustice
and
oppression
*NL*
have
yet
opened
your
eyes
!
I
shall
still
be
waiting
--
there
is
nothing
*NL*
else
that
I
can
do
.
There
is
no
wilderness
where
I
can
hide
from
these
*NL*
things
,
there
is
no
haven
where
I
can
escape
them
;
though
I
travel
to
*NL*
the
ends
of
the
earth
,
I
find
the
same
accursed
system
--
I
find
that
all
*NL*
the
fair
and
noble
impulses
of
humanity
,
the
dreams
of
poets
and
the
*NL*
agonies
of
martyrs
,
are
shackled
and
bound
in
the
service
of
organized
*NL*
and
predatory
Greed
!
And
therefore
I
can
not
rest
,
I
can
not
be
*NL*
silent
;
therefore
I
cast
aside
comfort
and
happiness
,
health
and
good
*NL*
repute
--
and
go
out
into
the
world
and
cry
out
the
pain
of
my
spirit
!
*NL*
Therefore
I
am
not
to
be
silenced
by
poverty
and
sickness
,
not
by
hatred
*NL*
and
obloquy
,
by
threats
and
ridicule
--
not
by
prison
and
persecution
,
if
*NL*
they
should
come
--
not
by
any
power
that
is
upon
the
earth
or
above
the
*NL*
earth
,
that
was
,
or
is
,
or
ever
can
be
created
.
If
I
fail
tonight
,
I
can
*NL*
only
try
tomorrow
;
knowing
that
the
fault
must
be
mine
--
that
if
once
*NL*
the
vision
of
my
soul
were
spoken
upon
earth
,
if
once
the
anguish
of
*NL*
its
defeat
were
uttered
in
human
speech
,
it
would
break
the
stoutest
*NL*
barriers
of
prejudice
,
it
would
shake
the
most
sluggish
soul
to
action
!
*NL*
It
would
abash
the
most
cynical
,
it
would
terrify
the
most
selfish
;
and
*NL*
the
voice
of
mockery
would
be
silenced
,
and
fraud
and
falsehood
would
*NL*
slink
back
into
their
dens
,
and
the
truth
would
stand
forth
alone
!
For
I
*NL*
speak
with
the
voice
of
the
millions
who
are
voiceless
!
Of
them
that
are
*NL*
oppressed
and
have
no
comforter
!
Of
the
disinherited
of
life
,
for
whom
*NL*
there
is
no
respite
and
no
deliverance
,
to
whom
the
world
is
a
prison
,
a
*NL*
dungeon
of
torture
,
a
tomb
!
With
the
voice
of
the
little
child
who
toils
*NL*
tonight
in
a
Southern
cotton
mill
,
staggering
with
exhaustion
,
numb
*NL*
with
agony
,
and
knowing
no
hope
but
the
grave
!
Of
the
mother
who
sews
by
*NL*
candlelight
in
her
tenement
garret
,
weary
and
weeping
,
smitten
with
*NL*
the
mortal
hunger
of
her
babes
!
Of
the
man
who
lies
upon
a
bed
of
rags
,
*NL*
wrestling
in
his
last
sickness
and
leaving
his
loved
ones
to
perish
!
Of
*NL*
the
young
girl
who
,
somewhere
at
this
moment
,
is
walking
the
streets
of
*NL*
this
horrible
city
,
beaten
and
starving
,
and
making
her
choice
between
*NL*
the
brothel
and
the
lake
!
With
the
voice
of
those
,
whoever
and
wherever
*NL*
they
may
be
,
who
are
caught
beneath
the
wheels
of
the
Juggernaut
of
*NL*
Greed
!
With
the
voice
of
humanity
,
calling
for
deliverance
!
Of
the
*NL*
everlasting
soul
of
Man
,
arising
from
the
dust
;
breaking
its
way
out
of
*NL*
its
prison
--
rending
the
bands
of
oppression
and
ignorance
--
groping
its
*NL*
way
to
the
light
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
speaker
paused
.
There
was
an
instant
of
silence
,
while
men
caught
*NL*
their
breaths
,
and
then
like
a
single
sound
there
came
a
cry
from
a
*NL*
thousand
people
.
Through
it
all
Jurgis
sat
still
,
motionless
and
rigid
,
*NL*
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
speaker
;
he
was
trembling
,
smitten
with
wonder
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
the
man
raised
his
hands
,
and
silence
fell
,
and
he
began
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
plead
with
you
,
''
he
said
,
``
whoever
you
may
be
,
provided
that
you
care
*NL*
about
the
truth
;
but
most
of
all
I
plead
with
working-man
,
with
those
*NL*
to
whom
the
evils
I
portray
are
not
mere
matters
of
sentiment
,
to
be
*NL*
dallied
and
toyed
with
,
and
then
perhaps
put
aside
and
forgotten
--
to
*NL*
whom
they
are
the
grim
and
relentless
realities
of
the
daily
grind
,
the
*NL*
chains
upon
their
limbs
,
the
lash
upon
their
backs
,
the
iron
in
their
*NL*
souls
.
To
you
,
working-men
!
To
you
,
the
toilers
,
who
have
made
this
*NL*
land
,
and
have
no
voice
in
its
councils
!
To
you
,
whose
lot
it
is
to
sow
*NL*
that
others
may
reap
,
to
labor
and
obey
,
and
ask
no
more
than
the
wages
*NL*
of
a
beast
of
burden
,
the
food
and
shelter
to
keep
you
alive
from
day
to
*NL*
day
.
It
is
to
you
that
I
come
with
my
message
of
salvation
,
it
is
to
you
*NL*
that
I
appeal
.
I
know
how
much
it
is
to
ask
of
you
--
I
know
,
for
I
have
*NL*
been
in
your
place
,
I
have
lived
your
life
,
and
there
is
no
man
before
*NL*
me
here
tonight
who
knows
it
better
.
I
have
known
what
it
is
to
be
a
*NL*
street-waif
,
a
bootblack
,
living
upon
a
crust
of
bread
and
sleeping
in
*NL*
cellar
stairways
and
under
empty
wagons
.
I
have
known
what
it
is
to
dare
*NL*
and
to
aspire
,
to
dream
mighty
dreams
and
to
see
them
perish
--
to
see
all
*NL*
the
fair
flowers
of
my
spirit
trampled
into
the
mire
by
the
wild-beast
*NL*
powers
of
my
life
.
I
know
what
is
the
price
that
a
working-man
pays
for
*NL*
knowledge
--
I
have
paid
for
it
with
food
and
sleep
,
with
agony
of
body
*NL*
and
mind
,
with
health
,
almost
with
life
itself
;
and
so
,
when
I
come
to
*NL*
you
with
a
story
of
hope
and
freedom
,
with
the
vision
of
a
new
earth
to
*NL*
be
created
,
of
a
new
labor
to
be
dared
,
I
am
not
surprised
that
I
find
*NL*
you
sordid
and
material
,
sluggish
and
incredulous
.
That
I
do
not
despair
*NL*
is
because
I
know
also
the
forces
that
are
driving
behind
you
--
because
*NL*
I
know
the
raging
lash
of
poverty
,
the
sting
of
contempt
and
mastership
,
*NL*
`
the
insolence
of
office
and
the
spurns
.
'
Because
I
feel
sure
that
in
*NL*
the
crowd
that
has
come
to
me
tonight
,
no
matter
how
many
may
be
dull
*NL*
and
heedless
,
no
matter
how
many
may
have
come
out
of
idle
curiosity
,
or
*NL*
in
order
to
ridicule
--
there
will
be
some
one
man
whom
pain
and
suffering
*NL*
have
made
desperate
,
whom
some
chance
vision
of
wrong
and
horror
has
*NL*
startled
and
shocked
into
attention
.
And
to
him
my
words
will
come
like
*NL*
a
sudden
flash
of
lightning
to
one
who
travels
in
darkness
--
revealing
*NL*
the
way
before
him
,
the
perils
and
the
obstacles
--
solving
all
problems
,
*NL*
making
all
difficulties
clear
!
The
scales
will
fall
from
his
eyes
,
the
*NL*
shackles
will
be
torn
from
his
limbs
--
he
will
leap
up
with
a
cry
of
*NL*
thankfulness
,
he
will
stride
forth
a
free
man
at
last
!
A
man
*NL*
delivered
from
his
self-created
slavery
!
A
man
who
will
never
more
*NL*
be
trapped
--
whom
no
blandishments
will
cajole
,
whom
no
threats
will
*NL*
frighten
;
who
from
tonight
on
will
move
forward
,
and
not
backward
,
who
*NL*
will
study
and
understand
,
who
will
gird
on
his
sword
and
take
his
*NL*
place
in
the
army
of
his
comrades
and
brothers
.
Who
will
carry
the
good
*NL*
tidings
to
others
,
as
I
have
carried
them
to
him
--
priceless
gift
of
*NL*
liberty
and
light
that
is
neither
mine
nor
his
,
but
is
the
heritage
of
*NL*
the
soul
of
man
!
Working-men
,
working-men
--
comrades
!
open
your
eyes
and
*NL*
look
about
you
!
You
have
lived
so
long
in
the
toil
and
heat
that
your
*NL*
senses
are
dulled
,
your
souls
are
numbed
;
but
realize
once
in
your
lives
*NL*
this
world
in
which
you
dwell
--
tear
off
the
rags
of
its
customs
and
*NL*
conventions
--
behold
it
as
it
is
,
in
all
its
hideous
nakedness
!
Realize
*NL*
it
,
realize
it
!
Realize
that
out
upon
the
plains
of
Manchuria
tonight
*NL*
two
hostile
armies
are
facing
each
other
--
that
now
,
while
we
are
seated
*NL*
here
,
a
million
human
beings
may
be
hurled
at
each
other
's
throats
,
*NL*
striving
with
the
fury
of
maniacs
to
tear
each
other
to
pieces
!
And
this
*NL*
in
the
twentieth
century
,
nineteen
hundred
years
since
the
Prince
of
*NL*
Peace
was
born
on
earth
!
Nineteen
hundred
years
that
his
words
have
been
*NL*
preached
as
divine
,
and
here
two
armies
of
men
are
rending
and
tearing
*NL*
each
other
like
the
wild
beasts
of
the
forest
!
Philosophers
have
*NL*
reasoned
,
prophets
have
denounced
,
poets
have
wept
and
pleaded
--
and
*NL*
still
this
hideous
Monster
roams
at
large
!
We
have
schools
and
colleges
,
*NL*
newspapers
and
books
;
we
have
searched
the
heavens
and
the
earth
,
we
*NL*
have
weighed
and
probed
and
reasoned
--
and
all
to
equip
men
to
destroy
*NL*
each
other
!
We
call
it
War
,
and
pass
it
by
--
but
do
not
put
me
off
with
*NL*
platitudes
and
conventions
--
come
with
me
,
come
with
me
--
realize
it
!
*NL*
See
the
bodies
of
men
pierced
by
bullets
,
blown
into
pieces
by
bursting
*NL*
shells
!
Hear
the
crunching
of
the
bayonet
,
plunged
into
human
flesh
;
*NL*
hear
the
groans
and
shrieks
of
agony
,
see
the
faces
of
men
crazed
by
*NL*
pain
,
turned
into
fiends
by
fury
and
hate
!
Put
your
hand
upon
that
piece
*NL*
of
flesh
--
it
is
hot
and
quivering
--
just
now
it
was
a
part
of
a
man
!
This
*NL*
blood
is
still
steaming
--
it
was
driven
by
a
human
heart
!
Almighty
God
!
*NL*
and
this
goes
on
--
it
is
systematic
,
organized
,
premeditated
!
And
we
know
*NL*
it
,
and
read
of
it
,
and
take
it
for
granted
;
our
papers
tell
of
it
,
and
*NL*
the
presses
are
not
stopped
--
our
churches
know
of
it
,
and
do
not
close
*NL*
their
doors
--
the
people
behold
it
,
and
do
not
rise
up
in
horror
and
*NL*
revolution
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
perhaps
Manchuria
is
too
far
away
for
you
--
come
home
with
me
then
,
*NL*
come
here
to
Chicago
.
Here
in
this
city
to-night
ten
thousand
women
are
*NL*
shut
up
in
foul
pens
,
and
driven
by
hunger
to
sell
their
bodies
to
live
.
*NL*
And
we
know
it
,
we
make
it
a
jest
!
And
these
women
are
made
in
the
image
*NL*
of
your
mothers
,
they
may
be
your
sisters
,
your
daughters
;
the
child
*NL*
whom
you
left
at
home
tonight
,
whose
laughing
eyes
will
greet
you
in
the
*NL*
morning
--
that
fate
may
be
waiting
for
her
!
To-night
in
Chicago
there
are
*NL*
ten
thousand
men
,
homeless
and
wretched
,
willing
to
work
and
begging
for
*NL*
a
chance
,
yet
starving
,
and
fronting
in
terror
the
awful
winter
cold
!
*NL*
Tonight
in
Chicago
there
are
a
hundred
thousand
children
wearing
out
*NL*
their
strength
and
blasting
their
lives
in
the
effort
to
earn
their
*NL*
bread
!
There
are
a
hundred
thousand
mothers
who
are
living
in
misery
and
*NL*
squalor
,
struggling
to
earn
enough
to
feed
their
little
ones
!
There
are
*NL*
a
hundred
thousand
old
people
,
cast
off
and
helpless
,
waiting
for
death
*NL*
to
take
them
from
their
torments
!
There
are
a
million
people
,
men
and
*NL*
women
and
children
,
who
share
the
curse
of
the
wage-slave
;
who
toil
*NL*
every
hour
they
can
stand
and
see
,
for
just
enough
to
keep
them
alive
;
*NL*
who
are
condemned
till
the
end
of
their
days
to
monotony
and
weariness
,
*NL*
to
hunger
and
misery
,
to
heat
and
cold
,
to
dirt
and
disease
,
to
*NL*
ignorance
and
drunkenness
and
vice
!
And
then
turn
over
the
page
with
me
,
*NL*
and
gaze
upon
the
other
side
of
the
picture
.
There
are
a
thousand
--
ten
*NL*
thousand
,
maybe
--
who
are
the
masters
of
these
slaves
,
who
own
their
*NL*
toil
.
They
do
nothing
to
earn
what
they
receive
,
they
do
not
even
have
*NL*
to
ask
for
it
--
it
comes
to
them
of
itself
,
their
only
care
is
to
dispose
*NL*
of
it
.
They
live
in
palaces
,
they
riot
in
luxury
and
extravagance
--
such
*NL*
as
no
words
can
describe
,
as
makes
the
imagination
reel
and
stagger
,
*NL*
makes
the
soul
grow
sick
and
faint
.
They
spend
hundreds
of
dollars
for
a
*NL*
pair
of
shoes
,
a
handkerchief
,
a
garter
;
they
spend
millions
for
horses
*NL*
and
automobiles
and
yachts
,
for
palaces
and
banquets
,
for
little
shiny
*NL*
stones
with
which
to
deck
their
bodies
.
Their
life
is
a
contest
among
*NL*
themselves
for
supremacy
in
ostentation
and
recklessness
,
in
the
*NL*
destroying
of
useful
and
necessary
things
,
in
the
wasting
of
the
labor
*NL*
and
the
lives
of
their
fellow
creatures
,
the
toil
and
anguish
of
the
*NL*
nations
,
the
sweat
and
tears
and
blood
of
the
human
race
!
It
is
all
*NL*
theirs
--
it
comes
to
them
;
just
as
all
the
springs
pour
into
streamlets
,
*NL*
and
the
streamlets
into
rivers
,
and
the
rivers
into
the
oceans
--
so
,
*NL*
automatically
and
inevitably
,
all
the
wealth
of
society
comes
to
them
.
*NL*
The
farmer
tills
the
soil
,
the
miner
digs
in
the
earth
,
the
weaver
tends
*NL*
the
loom
,
the
mason
carves
the
stone
;
the
clever
man
invents
,
the
shrewd
*NL*
man
directs
,
the
wise
man
studies
,
the
inspired
man
sings
--
and
all
the
*NL*
result
,
the
products
of
the
labor
of
brain
and
muscle
,
are
gathered
into
*NL*
one
stupendous
stream
and
poured
into
their
laps
!
The
whole
of
society
*NL*
is
in
their
grip
,
the
whole
labor
of
the
world
lies
at
their
mercy
--
and
*NL*
like
fierce
wolves
they
rend
and
destroy
,
like
ravening
vultures
they
*NL*
devour
and
tear
!
The
whole
power
of
mankind
belongs
to
them
,
forever
*NL*
and
beyond
recall
--
do
what
it
can
,
strive
as
it
will
,
humanity
lives
for
*NL*
them
and
dies
for
them
!
They
own
not
merely
the
labor
of
society
,
they
*NL*
have
bought
the
governments
;
and
everywhere
they
use
their
raped
and
*NL*
stolen
power
to
intrench
themselves
in
their
privileges
,
to
dig
wider
*NL*
and
deeper
the
channels
through
which
the
river
of
profits
flows
to
*NL*
them
!
--
And
you
,
workingmen
,
workingmen
!
You
have
been
brought
up
to
*NL*
it
,
you
plod
on
like
beasts
of
burden
,
thinking
only
of
the
day
and
its
*NL*
pain
--
yet
is
there
a
man
among
you
who
can
believe
that
such
a
system
*NL*
will
continue
forever
--
is
there
a
man
here
in
this
audience
tonight
*NL*
so
hardened
and
debased
that
he
dare
rise
up
before
me
and
say
that
*NL*
he
believes
it
can
continue
forever
;
that
the
product
of
the
labor
of
*NL*
society
,
the
means
of
existence
of
the
human
race
,
will
always
belong
*NL*
to
idlers
and
parasites
,
to
be
spent
for
the
gratification
of
vanity
and
*NL*
lust
--
to
be
spent
for
any
purpose
whatever
,
to
be
at
the
disposal
of
any
*NL*
individual
will
whatever
--
that
somehow
,
somewhere
,
the
labor
of
humanity
*NL*
will
not
belong
to
humanity
,
to
be
used
for
the
purposes
of
humanity
,
to
*NL*
be
controlled
by
the
will
of
humanity
?
And
if
this
is
ever
to
be
,
how
is
*NL*
it
to
be
--
what
power
is
there
that
will
bring
it
about
?
Will
it
be
the
*NL*
task
of
your
masters
,
do
you
think
--
will
they
write
the
charter
of
your
*NL*
liberties
?
Will
they
forge
you
the
sword
of
your
deliverance
,
will
they
*NL*
marshal
you
the
army
and
lead
it
to
the
fray
?
Will
their
wealth
be
spent
*NL*
for
the
purpose
--
will
they
build
colleges
and
churches
to
teach
you
,
*NL*
will
they
print
papers
to
herald
your
progress
,
and
organize
political
*NL*
parties
to
guide
and
carry
on
the
struggle
?
Can
you
not
see
that
the
*NL*
task
is
your
task
--
yours
to
dream
,
yours
to
resolve
,
yours
to
execute
?
*NL*
That
if
ever
it
is
carried
out
,
it
will
be
in
the
face
of
every
obstacle
*NL*
that
wealth
and
mastership
can
oppose
--
in
the
face
of
ridicule
and
*NL*
slander
,
of
hatred
and
persecution
,
of
the
bludgeon
and
the
jail
?
That
*NL*
it
will
be
by
the
power
of
your
naked
bosoms
,
opposed
to
the
rage
of
*NL*
oppression
!
By
the
grim
and
bitter
teaching
of
blind
and
merciless
*NL*
affliction
!
By
the
painful
gropings
of
the
untutored
mind
,
by
the
feeble
*NL*
stammerings
of
the
uncultured
voice
!
By
the
sad
and
lonely
hunger
of
*NL*
the
spirit
;
by
seeking
and
striving
and
yearning
,
by
heartache
and
*NL*
despairing
,
by
agony
and
sweat
of
blood
!
It
will
be
by
money
paid
for
*NL*
with
hunger
,
by
knowledge
stolen
from
sleep
,
by
thoughts
communicated
*NL*
under
the
shadow
of
the
gallows
!
It
will
be
a
movement
beginning
in
the
*NL*
far-off
past
,
a
thing
obscure
and
unhonored
,
a
thing
easy
to
ridicule
,
*NL*
easy
to
despise
;
a
thing
unlovely
,
wearing
the
aspect
of
vengeance
and
*NL*
hate
--
but
to
you
,
the
working-man
,
the
wage-slave
,
calling
with
a
voice
*NL*
insistent
,
imperious
--
with
a
voice
that
you
can
not
escape
,
wherever
upon
*NL*
the
earth
you
may
be
!
With
the
voice
of
all
your
wrongs
,
with
the
voice
*NL*
of
all
your
desires
;
with
the
voice
of
your
duty
and
your
hope
--
of
*NL*
everything
in
the
world
that
is
worth
while
to
you
!
The
voice
of
the
*NL*
poor
,
demanding
that
poverty
shall
cease
!
The
voice
of
the
oppressed
,
*NL*
pronouncing
the
doom
of
oppression
!
The
voice
of
power
,
wrought
out
of
*NL*
suffering
--
of
resolution
,
crushed
out
of
weakness
--
of
joy
and
courage
,
*NL*
born
in
the
bottomless
pit
of
anguish
and
despair
!
The
voice
of
Labor
,
*NL*
despised
and
outraged
;
a
mighty
giant
,
lying
prostrate
--
mountainous
,
*NL*
colossal
,
but
blinded
,
bound
,
and
ignorant
of
his
strength
.
And
now
a
*NL*
dream
of
resistance
haunts
him
,
hope
battling
with
fear
;
until
suddenly
*NL*
he
stirs
,
and
a
fetter
snaps
--
and
a
thrill
shoots
through
him
,
to
the
*NL*
farthest
ends
of
his
huge
body
,
and
in
a
flash
the
dream
becomes
an
act
!
*NL*
He
starts
,
he
lifts
himself
;
and
the
bands
are
shattered
,
the
burdens
*NL*
roll
off
him
--
he
rises
--
towering
,
gigantic
;
he
springs
to
his
feet
,
he
*NL*
shouts
in
his
newborn
exultation
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
speaker
's
voice
broke
suddenly
,
with
the
stress
of
his
feelings
;
*NL*
he
stood
with
his
arms
stretched
out
above
him
,
and
the
power
of
his
*NL*
vision
seemed
to
lift
him
from
the
floor
.
The
audience
came
to
its
feet
*NL*
with
a
yell
;
men
waved
their
arms
,
laughing
aloud
in
their
excitement
.
*NL*
And
Jurgis
was
with
them
,
he
was
shouting
to
tear
his
throat
;
shouting
*NL*
because
he
could
not
help
it
,
because
the
stress
of
his
feeling
was
more
*NL*
than
he
could
bear
.
It
was
not
merely
the
man
's
words
,
the
torrent
*NL*
of
his
eloquence
.
It
was
his
presence
,
it
was
his
voice
:
a
voice
with
*NL*
strange
intonations
that
rang
through
the
chambers
of
the
soul
like
the
*NL*
clanging
of
a
bell
--
that
gripped
the
listener
like
a
mighty
hand
about
*NL*
his
body
,
that
shook
him
and
startled
him
with
sudden
fright
,
with
*NL*
a
sense
of
things
not
of
earth
,
of
mysteries
never
spoken
before
,
of
*NL*
presences
of
awe
and
terror
!
There
was
an
unfolding
of
vistas
before
*NL*
him
,
a
breaking
of
the
ground
beneath
him
,
an
upheaving
,
a
stirring
,
*NL*
a
trembling
;
he
felt
himself
suddenly
a
mere
man
no
longer
--
there
were
*NL*
powers
within
him
undreamed
of
,
there
were
demon
forces
contending
,
*NL*
age-long
wonders
struggling
to
be
born
;
and
he
sat
oppressed
with
pain
*NL*
and
joy
,
while
a
tingling
stole
down
into
his
finger
tips
,
and
his
*NL*
breath
came
hard
and
fast
.
The
sentences
of
this
man
were
to
Jurgis
like
*NL*
the
crashing
of
thunder
in
his
soul
;
a
flood
of
emotions
surged
up
*NL*
in
him
--
all
his
old
hopes
and
longings
,
his
old
griefs
and
rages
and
*NL*
despairs
.
All
that
he
had
ever
felt
in
his
whole
life
seemed
to
come
*NL*
back
to
him
at
once
,
and
with
one
new
emotion
,
hardly
to
be
described
.
*NL*
That
he
should
have
suffered
such
oppressions
and
such
horrors
was
bad
*NL*
enough
;
but
that
he
should
have
been
crushed
and
beaten
by
them
,
that
he
*NL*
should
have
submitted
,
and
forgotten
,
and
lived
in
peace
--
ah
,
truly
that
*NL*
was
a
thing
not
to
be
put
into
words
,
a
thing
not
to
be
borne
by
a
human
*NL*
creature
,
a
thing
of
terror
and
madness
!
``
What
,
''
asks
the
prophet
,
``
is
*NL*
the
murder
of
them
that
kill
the
body
,
to
the
murder
of
them
that
kill
*NL*
the
soul
?
''
And
Jurgis
was
a
man
whose
soul
had
been
murdered
,
who
had
*NL*
ceased
to
hope
and
to
struggle
--
who
had
made
terms
with
degradation
*NL*
and
despair
;
and
now
,
suddenly
,
in
one
awful
convulsion
,
the
black
and
*NL*
hideous
fact
was
made
plain
to
him
!
There
was
a
falling
in
of
all
the
*NL*
pillars
of
his
soul
,
the
sky
seemed
to
split
above
him
--
he
stood
there
,
*NL*
with
his
clenched
hands
upraised
,
his
eyes
bloodshot
,
and
the
veins
*NL*
standing
out
purple
in
his
face
,
roaring
in
the
voice
of
a
wild
beast
,
*NL*
frantic
,
incoherent
,
maniacal
.
And
when
he
could
shout
no
more
he
still
*NL*
stood
there
,
gasping
,
and
whispering
hoarsely
to
himself
:
``
By
God
!
By
*NL*
God
!
By
God
!

The
man
had
gone
back
to
a
seat
upon
the
platform
,
and
Jurgis
realized
*NL*
that
his
speech
was
over
.
The
applause
continued
for
several
minutes
;
*NL*
and
then
some
one
started
a
song
,
and
the
crowd
took
it
up
,
and
the
*NL*
place
shook
with
it
.
Jurgis
had
never
heard
it
,
and
he
could
not
make
*NL*
out
the
words
,
but
the
wild
and
wonderful
spirit
of
it
seized
upon
*NL*
him
--
it
was
the
``
Marseillaise
!
''
As
stanza
after
stanza
of
it
thundered
*NL*
forth
,
he
sat
with
his
hands
clasped
,
trembling
in
every
nerve
.
He
*NL*
had
never
been
so
stirred
in
his
life
--
it
was
a
miracle
that
had
been
*NL*
wrought
in
him
.
He
could
not
think
at
all
,
he
was
stunned
;
yet
he
knew
*NL*
that
in
the
mighty
upheaval
that
had
taken
place
in
his
soul
,
a
new
man
*NL*
had
been
born
.
He
had
been
torn
out
of
the
jaws
of
destruction
,
he
had
*NL*
been
delivered
from
the
thraldom
of
despair
;
the
whole
world
had
been
*NL*
changed
for
him
--
he
was
free
,
he
was
free
!
Even
if
he
were
to
suffer
as
*NL*
he
had
before
,
even
if
he
were
to
beg
and
starve
,
nothing
would
be
the
*NL*
same
to
him
;
he
would
understand
it
,
and
bear
it
.
He
would
no
longer
*NL*
be
the
sport
of
circumstances
,
he
would
be
a
man
,
with
a
will
and
a
*NL*
purpose
;
he
would
have
something
to
fight
for
,
something
to
die
for
,
*NL*
if
need
be
!
Here
were
men
who
would
show
him
and
help
him
;
and
he
would
*NL*
have
friends
and
allies
,
he
would
dwell
in
the
sight
of
justice
,
and
*NL*
walk
arm
in
arm
with
power
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
audience
subsided
again
,
and
Jurgis
sat
back
.
The
chairman
of
the
*NL*
meeting
came
forward
and
began
to
speak
.
His
voice
sounded
thin
and
*NL*
futile
after
the
other
's
,
and
to
Jurgis
it
seemed
a
profanation
.
Why
*NL*
should
any
one
else
speak
,
after
that
miraculous
man
--
why
should
they
*NL*
not
all
sit
in
silence
?
The
chairman
was
explaining
that
a
collection
*NL*
would
now
be
taken
up
to
defray
the
expenses
of
the
meeting
,
and
for
the
*NL*
benefit
of
the
campaign
fund
of
the
party
.
Jurgis
heard
;
but
he
had
not
*NL*
a
penny
to
give
,
and
so
his
thoughts
went
elsewhere
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
orator
,
who
sat
in
an
armchair
,
his
head
*NL*
leaning
on
his
hand
and
his
attitude
indicating
exhaustion
.
But
suddenly
*NL*
he
stood
up
again
,
and
Jurgis
heard
the
chairman
of
the
meeting
saying
*NL*
that
the
speaker
would
now
answer
any
questions
which
the
audience
might
*NL*
care
to
put
to
him
.
The
man
came
forward
,
and
some
one
--
a
woman
--
arose
*NL*
and
asked
about
some
opinion
the
speaker
had
expressed
concerning
*NL*
Tolstoy
.
Jurgis
had
never
heard
of
Tolstoy
,
and
did
not
care
anything
*NL*
about
him
.
Why
should
any
one
want
to
ask
such
questions
,
after
an
*NL*
address
like
that
?
The
thing
was
not
to
talk
,
but
to
do
;
the
thing
was
*NL*
to
get
bold
of
others
and
rouse
them
,
to
organize
them
and
prepare
for
*NL*
the
fight
!
But
still
the
discussion
went
on
,
in
ordinary
conversational
*NL*
tones
,
and
it
brought
Jurgis
back
to
the
everyday
world
.
A
few
minutes
*NL*
ago
he
had
felt
like
seizing
the
hand
of
the
beautiful
lady
by
his
side
,
*NL*
and
kissing
it
;
he
had
felt
like
flinging
his
arms
about
the
neck
of
the
*NL*
man
on
the
other
side
of
him
.
And
now
he
began
to
realize
again
that
he
*NL*
was
a
``
hobo
,
''
that
he
was
ragged
and
dirty
,
and
smelled
bad
,
and
had
no
*NL*
place
to
sleep
that
night
!
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
,
at
last
,
when
the
meeting
broke
up
,
and
the
audience
started
to
*NL*
leave
,
poor
Jurgis
was
in
an
agony
of
uncertainty
.
He
had
not
thought
of
*NL*
leaving
--
he
had
thought
that
the
vision
must
last
forever
,
that
he
had
*NL*
found
comrades
and
brothers
.
But
now
he
would
go
out
,
and
the
thing
*NL*
would
fade
away
,
and
he
would
never
be
able
to
find
it
again
!
He
sat
in
*NL*
his
seat
,
frightened
and
wondering
;
but
others
in
the
same
row
wanted
to
*NL*
get
out
,
and
so
he
had
to
stand
up
and
move
along
.
As
he
was
swept
down
*NL*
the
aisle
he
looked
from
one
person
to
another
,
wistfully
;
they
were
all
*NL*
excitedly
discussing
the
address
--
but
there
was
nobody
who
offered
to
*NL*
discuss
it
with
him
.
He
was
near
enough
to
the
door
to
feel
the
night
*NL*
air
,
when
desperation
seized
him
.
He
knew
nothing
at
all
about
that
*NL*
speech
he
had
heard
,
not
even
the
name
of
the
orator
;
and
he
was
to
go
*NL*
away
--
no
,
no
,
it
was
preposterous
,
he
must
speak
to
some
one
;
he
must
*NL*
find
that
man
himself
and
tell
him
.
He
would
not
despise
him
,
tramp
as
*NL*
he
was
!
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
stepped
into
an
empty
row
of
seats
and
watched
,
and
when
the
crowd
*NL*
had
thinned
out
,
he
started
toward
the
platform
.
The
speaker
was
gone
;
*NL*
but
there
was
a
stage
door
that
stood
open
,
with
people
passing
in
and
*NL*
out
,
and
no
one
on
guard
.
Jurgis
summoned
up
his
courage
and
went
in
,
*NL*
and
down
a
hallway
,
and
to
the
door
of
a
room
where
many
people
were
*NL*
crowded
.
No
one
paid
any
attention
to
him
,
and
he
pushed
in
,
and
in
a
*NL*
corner
he
saw
the
man
he
sought
.
The
orator
sat
in
a
chair
,
with
his
*NL*
shoulders
sunk
together
and
his
eyes
half
closed
;
his
face
was
ghastly
*NL*
pale
,
almost
greenish
in
hue
,
and
one
arm
lay
limp
at
his
side
.
A
big
*NL*
man
with
spectacles
on
stood
near
him
,
and
kept
pushing
back
the
crowd
,
*NL*
saying
,
``
Stand
away
a
little
,
please
;
ca
n't
you
see
the
comrade
is
worn
*NL*
out
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
Jurgis
stood
watching
,
while
five
or
ten
minutes
passed
.
Now
and
then
*NL*
the
man
would
look
up
,
and
address
a
word
or
two
to
those
who
were
*NL*
near
him
;
and
,
at
last
,
on
one
of
these
occasions
,
his
glance
rested
*NL*
on
Jurgis
.
There
seemed
to
be
a
slight
hint
of
inquiry
about
it
,
and
a
*NL*
sudden
impulse
seized
the
other
.
He
stepped
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wanted
to
thank
you
,
sir
!
''
he
began
,
in
breathless
haste
.
``
I
could
*NL*
not
go
away
without
telling
you
how
much
--
how
glad
I
am
I
heard
you
.
*NL*
I
--
I
did
n't
know
anything
about
it
all
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
big
man
with
the
spectacles
,
who
had
moved
away
,
came
back
at
this
*NL*
moment
.
``
The
comrade
is
too
tired
to
talk
to
any
one
--
''
he
began
;
but
*NL*
the
other
held
up
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
,
''
he
said
.
``
He
has
something
to
say
to
me
.
''
And
then
he
looked
*NL*
into
Jurgis
's
face
.
``
You
want
to
know
more
about
Socialism
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
started
.
``
I
--
I
--
''
he
stammered
.
``
Is
it
Socialism
?
I
did
n't
know
.
*NL*
I
want
to
know
about
what
you
spoke
of
--
I
want
to
help
.
I
have
been
*NL*
through
all
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
do
you
live
?
''
asked
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
home
,
''
said
Jurgis
,
``
I
am
out
of
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
foreigner
,
are
you
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lithuanian
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
thought
for
a
moment
,
and
then
turned
to
his
friend
.
``
Who
is
*NL*
there
,
Walters
?
''
he
asked
.
``
There
is
Ostrinski
--
but
he
is
a
Pole
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ostrinski
speaks
Lithuanian
,
''
said
the
other
.
``
All
right
,
then
;
would
*NL*
you
mind
seeing
if
he
has
gone
yet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
started
away
,
and
the
speaker
looked
at
Jurgis
again
.
He
had
*NL*
deep
,
black
eyes
,
and
a
face
full
of
gentleness
and
pain
.
``
You
must
*NL*
excuse
me
,
comrade
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
am
just
tired
out
--
I
have
spoken
every
*NL*
day
for
the
last
month
.
I
will
introduce
you
to
some
one
who
will
be
*NL*
able
to
help
you
as
well
as
I
could
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
messenger
had
had
to
go
no
further
than
the
door
,
he
came
back
,
*NL*
followed
by
a
man
whom
he
introduced
to
Jurgis
as
``
Comrade
Ostrinski
.
''
*NL*
Comrade
Ostrinski
was
a
little
man
,
scarcely
up
to
Jurgis
's
shoulder
,
*NL*
wizened
and
wrinkled
,
very
ugly
,
and
slightly
lame
.
He
had
on
a
*NL*
long-tailed
black
coat
,
worn
green
at
the
seams
and
the
buttonholes
;
his
*NL*
eyes
must
have
been
weak
,
for
he
wore
green
spectacles
that
gave
him
*NL*
a
grotesque
appearance
.
But
his
handclasp
was
hearty
,
and
he
spoke
in
*NL*
Lithuanian
,
which
warmed
Jurgis
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
want
to
know
about
Socialism
?
''
he
said
.
``
Surely
.
Let
us
go
out
and
*NL*
take
a
stroll
,
where
we
can
be
quiet
and
talk
some
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
Jurgis
bade
farewell
to
the
master
wizard
,
and
went
out
.
*NL*
Ostrinski
asked
where
he
lived
,
offering
to
walk
in
that
direction
;
*NL*
and
so
he
had
to
explain
once
more
that
he
was
without
a
home
.
At
the
*NL*
other
's
request
he
told
his
story
;
how
he
had
come
to
America
,
and
*NL*
what
had
happened
to
him
in
the
stockyards
,
and
how
his
family
had
been
*NL*
broken
up
,
and
how
he
had
become
a
wanderer
.
So
much
the
little
man
*NL*
heard
,
and
then
he
pressed
Jurgis
's
arm
tightly
.
``
You
have
been
through
*NL*
the
mill
,
comrade
!
''
he
said
.
``
We
will
make
a
fighter
out
of
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Ostrinski
in
turn
explained
his
circumstances
.
He
would
have
asked
*NL*
Jurgis
to
his
home
--
but
he
had
only
two
rooms
,
and
had
no
bed
to
offer
.
*NL*
He
would
have
given
up
his
own
bed
,
but
his
wife
was
ill
.
Later
on
,
when
*NL*
he
understood
that
otherwise
Jurgis
would
have
to
sleep
in
a
hallway
,
*NL*
he
offered
him
his
kitchen
floor
,
a
chance
which
the
other
was
only
too
*NL*
glad
to
accept
.
``
Perhaps
tomorrow
we
can
do
better
,
''
said
Ostrinski
.
``
We
*NL*
try
not
to
let
a
comrade
starve
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ostrinski
's
home
was
in
the
Ghetto
district
,
where
he
had
two
rooms
in
*NL*
the
basement
of
a
tenement
.
There
was
a
baby
crying
as
they
entered
,
*NL*
and
he
closed
the
door
leading
into
the
bedroom
.
He
had
three
young
*NL*
children
,
he
explained
,
and
a
baby
had
just
come
.
He
drew
up
two
chairs
*NL*
near
the
kitchen
stove
,
adding
that
Jurgis
must
excuse
the
disorder
of
*NL*
the
place
,
since
at
such
a
time
one
's
domestic
arrangements
were
upset
.
*NL*
Half
of
the
kitchen
was
given
up
to
a
workbench
,
which
was
piled
with
*NL*
clothing
,
and
Ostrinski
explained
that
he
was
a
``
pants
finisher
.
''
He
*NL*
brought
great
bundles
of
clothing
here
to
his
home
,
where
he
and
his
*NL*
wife
worked
on
them
.
He
made
a
living
at
it
,
but
it
was
getting
harder
*NL*
all
the
time
,
because
his
eyes
were
failing
.
What
would
come
when
they
*NL*
gave
out
he
could
not
tell
;
there
had
been
no
saving
anything
--
a
man
*NL*
could
barely
keep
alive
by
twelve
or
fourteen
hours
'
work
a
day
.
The
*NL*
finishing
of
pants
did
not
take
much
skill
,
and
anybody
could
learn
it
,
*NL*
and
so
the
pay
was
forever
getting
less
.
That
was
the
competitive
wage
*NL*
system
;
and
if
Jurgis
wanted
to
understand
what
Socialism
was
,
it
was
*NL*
there
he
had
best
begin
.
The
workers
were
dependent
upon
a
job
to
exist
*NL*
from
day
to
day
,
and
so
they
bid
against
each
other
,
and
no
man
could
*NL*
get
more
than
the
lowest
man
would
consent
to
work
for
.
And
thus
*NL*
the
mass
of
the
people
were
always
in
a
life-and-death
struggle
with
*NL*
poverty
.
That
was
``
competition
,
''
so
far
as
it
concerned
the
wage-earner
,
*NL*
the
man
who
had
only
his
labor
to
sell
;
to
those
on
top
,
the
exploiters
,
*NL*
it
appeared
very
differently
,
of
course
--
there
were
few
of
them
,
and
*NL*
they
could
combine
and
dominate
,
and
their
power
would
be
unbreakable
.
*NL*
And
so
all
over
the
world
two
classes
were
forming
,
with
an
unbridged
*NL*
chasm
between
them
--
the
capitalist
class
,
with
its
enormous
fortunes
,
*NL*
and
the
proletariat
,
bound
into
slavery
by
unseen
chains
.
The
latter
*NL*
were
a
thousand
to
one
in
numbers
,
but
they
were
ignorant
and
helpless
,
*NL*
and
they
would
remain
at
the
mercy
of
their
exploiters
until
they
were
*NL*
organized
--
until
they
had
become
``
class-conscious
.
''
It
was
a
slow
*NL*
and
weary
process
,
but
it
would
go
on
--
it
was
like
the
movement
of
a
*NL*
glacier
,
once
it
was
started
it
could
never
be
stopped
.
Every
*NL*
Socialist
did
his
share
,
and
lived
upon
the
vision
of
the
``
good
time
*NL*
coming
,
''
--
when
the
working
class
should
go
to
the
polls
and
seize
the
*NL*
powers
of
government
,
and
put
an
end
to
private
property
in
the
means
*NL*
of
production
.
No
matter
how
poor
a
man
was
,
or
how
much
he
suffered
,
he
*NL*
could
never
be
really
unhappy
while
he
knew
of
that
future
;
even
if
he
*NL*
did
not
live
to
see
it
himself
,
his
children
would
,
and
,
to
a
Socialist
,
*NL*
the
victory
of
his
class
was
his
victory
.
Also
he
had
always
the
*NL*
progress
to
encourage
him
;
here
in
Chicago
,
for
instance
,
the
movement
*NL*
was
growing
by
leaps
and
bounds
.
Chicago
was
the
industrial
center
*NL*
of
the
country
,
and
nowhere
else
were
the
unions
so
strong
;
but
their
*NL*
organizations
did
the
workers
little
good
,
for
the
employers
were
*NL*
organized
,
also
;
and
so
the
strikes
generally
failed
,
and
as
fast
as
the
*NL*
unions
were
broken
up
the
men
were
coming
over
to
the
Socialists
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ostrinski
explained
the
organization
of
the
party
,
the
machinery
by
*NL*
which
the
proletariat
was
educating
itself
.
There
were
``
locals
''
in
every
*NL*
big
city
and
town
,
and
they
were
being
organized
rapidly
in
the
smaller
*NL*
places
;
a
local
had
anywhere
from
six
to
a
thousand
members
,
and
there
*NL*
were
fourteen
hundred
of
them
in
all
,
with
a
total
of
about
twenty-five
*NL*
thousand
members
,
who
paid
dues
to
support
the
organization
.
``
Local
Cook
*NL*
County
,
''
as
the
city
organization
was
called
,
had
eighty
branch
locals
,
*NL*
and
it
alone
was
spending
several
thousand
dollars
in
the
campaign
.
It
*NL*
published
a
weekly
in
English
,
and
one
each
in
Bohemian
and
German
;
also
*NL*
there
was
a
monthly
published
in
Chicago
,
and
a
cooperative
publishing
*NL*
house
,
that
issued
a
million
and
a
half
of
Socialist
books
and
pamphlets
*NL*
every
year
.
All
this
was
the
growth
of
the
last
few
years
--
there
had
*NL*
been
almost
nothing
of
it
when
Ostrinski
first
came
to
Chicago
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ostrinski
was
a
Pole
,
about
fifty
years
of
age
.
He
had
lived
in
Silesia
,
*NL*
a
member
of
a
despised
and
persecuted
race
,
and
had
taken
part
in
the
*NL*
proletarian
movement
in
the
early
seventies
,
when
Bismarck
,
having
*NL*
conquered
France
,
had
turned
his
policy
of
blood
and
iron
upon
the
*NL*
``
International
.
''
Ostrinski
himself
had
twice
been
in
jail
,
but
he
had
*NL*
been
young
then
,
and
had
not
cared
.
He
had
had
more
of
his
share
of
the
*NL*
fight
,
though
,
for
just
when
Socialism
had
broken
all
its
barriers
and
*NL*
become
the
great
political
force
of
the
empire
,
he
had
come
to
America
,
*NL*
and
begun
all
over
again
.
In
America
every
one
had
laughed
at
the
mere
*NL*
idea
of
Socialism
then
--
in
America
all
men
were
free
.
As
if
political
*NL*
liberty
made
wage
slavery
any
the
more
tolerable
!
said
Ostrinski
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
tailor
sat
tilted
back
in
his
stiff
kitchen
chair
,
with
his
*NL*
feet
stretched
out
upon
the
empty
stove
,
and
speaking
in
low
whispers
,
*NL*
so
as
not
to
waken
those
in
the
next
room
.
To
Jurgis
he
seemed
a
*NL*
scarcely
less
wonderful
person
than
the
speaker
at
the
meeting
;
he
was
*NL*
poor
,
the
lowest
of
the
low
,
hunger-driven
and
miserable
--
and
yet
how
*NL*
much
he
knew
,
how
much
he
had
dared
and
achieved
,
what
a
hero
he
had
*NL*
been
!
There
were
others
like
him
,
too
--
thousands
like
him
,
and
all
of
*NL*
them
workingmen
!
That
all
this
wonderful
machinery
of
progress
had
been
*NL*
created
by
his
fellows
--
Jurgis
could
not
believe
it
,
it
seemed
too
good
*NL*
to
be
true
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
always
the
way
,
said
Ostrinski
;
when
a
man
was
first
converted
*NL*
to
Socialism
he
was
like
a
crazy
person
--
he
could
not
understand
how
*NL*
others
could
fail
to
see
it
,
and
he
expected
to
convert
all
the
world
*NL*
the
first
week
.
After
a
while
he
would
realize
how
hard
a
task
it
was
;
*NL*
and
then
it
would
be
fortunate
that
other
new
hands
kept
coming
,
to
save
*NL*
him
from
settling
down
into
a
rut
.
Just
now
Jurgis
would
have
plenty
of
*NL*
chance
to
vent
his
excitement
,
for
a
presidential
campaign
was
on
,
and
*NL*
everybody
was
talking
politics
.
Ostrinski
would
take
him
to
the
next
*NL*
meeting
of
the
branch
local
,
and
introduce
him
,
and
he
might
join
the
*NL*
party
.
The
dues
were
five
cents
a
week
,
but
any
one
who
could
not
afford
*NL*
this
might
be
excused
from
paying
.
The
Socialist
party
was
a
really
*NL*
democratic
political
organization
--
it
was
controlled
absolutely
by
*NL*
its
own
membership
,
and
had
no
bosses
.
All
of
these
things
Ostrinski
*NL*
explained
,
as
also
the
principles
of
the
party
.
You
might
say
that
there
*NL*
was
really
but
one
Socialist
principle
--
that
of
``
no
compromise
,
''
which
*NL*
was
the
essence
of
the
proletarian
movement
all
over
the
world
.
When
a
*NL*
Socialist
was
elected
to
office
he
voted
with
old
party
legislators
for
*NL*
any
measure
that
was
likely
to
be
of
help
to
the
working
class
,
but
*NL*
he
never
forgot
that
these
concessions
,
whatever
they
might
be
,
were
*NL*
trifles
compared
with
the
great
purpose
--
the
organizing
of
the
working
*NL*
class
for
the
revolution
.
So
far
,
the
rule
in
America
had
been
that
*NL*
one
Socialist
made
another
Socialist
once
every
two
years
;
and
if
*NL*
they
should
maintain
the
same
rate
they
would
carry
the
country
in
*NL*
1912
--
though
not
all
of
them
expected
to
succeed
as
quickly
as
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Socialists
were
organized
in
every
civilized
nation
;
it
was
an
*NL*
international
political
party
,
said
Ostrinski
,
the
greatest
the
world
*NL*
had
ever
known
.
It
numbered
thirty
million
of
adherents
,
and
it
cast
*NL*
eight
million
votes
.
It
had
started
its
first
newspaper
in
Japan
,
and
*NL*
elected
its
first
deputy
in
Argentina
;
in
France
it
named
members
of
*NL*
cabinets
,
and
in
Italy
and
Australia
it
held
the
balance
of
power
and
*NL*
turned
out
ministries
.
In
Germany
,
where
its
vote
was
more
than
a
third
*NL*
of
the
total
vote
of
the
empire
,
all
other
parties
and
powers
had
united
*NL*
to
fight
it
.
It
would
not
do
,
Ostrinski
explained
,
for
the
proletariat
*NL*
of
one
nation
to
achieve
the
victory
,
for
that
nation
would
be
crushed
*NL*
by
the
military
power
of
the
others
;
and
so
the
Socialist
movement
was
a
*NL*
world
movement
,
an
organization
of
all
mankind
to
establish
liberty
and
*NL*
fraternity
.
It
was
the
new
religion
of
humanity
--
or
you
might
say
it
was
*NL*
the
fulfillment
of
the
old
religion
,
since
it
implied
but
the
literal
*NL*
application
of
all
the
teachings
of
Christ
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Until
long
after
midnight
Jurgis
sat
lost
in
the
conversation
of
his
*NL*
new
acquaintance
.
It
was
a
most
wonderful
experience
to
him
--
an
almost
*NL*
supernatural
experience
.
It
was
like
encountering
an
inhabitant
of
*NL*
the
fourth
dimension
of
space
,
a
being
who
was
free
from
all
one
's
*NL*
own
limitations
.
For
four
years
,
now
,
Jurgis
had
been
wondering
and
*NL*
blundering
in
the
depths
of
a
wilderness
;
and
here
,
suddenly
,
a
hand
*NL*
reached
down
and
seized
him
,
and
lifted
him
out
of
it
,
and
set
him
upon
*NL*
a
mountain-top
,
from
which
he
could
survey
it
all
--
could
see
the
paths
*NL*
from
which
he
had
wandered
,
the
morasses
into
which
he
had
stumbled
,
the
*NL*
hiding
places
of
the
beasts
of
prey
that
had
fallen
upon
him
.
There
*NL*
were
his
Packingtown
experiences
,
for
instance
--
what
was
there
about
*NL*
Packingtown
that
Ostrinski
could
not
explain
!
To
Jurgis
the
packers
had
*NL*
been
equivalent
to
fate
;
Ostrinski
showed
him
that
they
were
the
Beef
*NL*
Trust
.
They
were
a
gigantic
combination
of
capital
,
which
had
crushed
*NL*
all
opposition
,
and
overthrown
the
laws
of
the
land
,
and
was
preying
*NL*
upon
the
people
.
Jurgis
recollected
how
,
when
he
had
first
come
to
*NL*
Packingtown
,
he
had
stood
and
watched
the
hog-killing
,
and
thought
how
*NL*
cruel
and
savage
it
was
,
and
come
away
congratulating
himself
that
he
*NL*
was
not
a
hog
;
now
his
new
acquaintance
showed
him
that
a
hog
was
just
*NL*
what
he
had
been
--
one
of
the
packers
'
hogs
.
What
they
wanted
from
a
hog
*NL*
was
all
the
profits
that
could
be
got
out
of
him
;
and
that
was
what
they
*NL*
wanted
from
the
workingman
,
and
also
that
was
what
they
wanted
from
*NL*
the
public
.
What
the
hog
thought
of
it
,
and
what
he
suffered
,
were
*NL*
not
considered
;
and
no
more
was
it
with
labor
,
and
no
more
with
the
*NL*
purchaser
of
meat
.
That
was
true
everywhere
in
the
world
,
but
it
was
*NL*
especially
true
in
Packingtown
;
there
seemed
to
be
something
about
the
*NL*
work
of
slaughtering
that
tended
to
ruthlessness
and
ferocity
--
it
was
*NL*
literally
the
fact
that
in
the
methods
of
the
packers
a
hundred
human
*NL*
lives
did
not
balance
a
penny
of
profit
.
When
Jurgis
had
made
himself
*NL*
familiar
with
the
Socialist
literature
,
as
he
would
very
quickly
,
he
*NL*
would
get
glimpses
of
the
Beef
Trust
from
all
sorts
of
aspects
,
and
he
*NL*
would
find
it
everywhere
the
same
;
it
was
the
incarnation
of
blind
and
*NL*
insensate
Greed
.
It
was
a
monster
devouring
with
a
thousand
mouths
,
*NL*
trampling
with
a
thousand
hoofs
;
it
was
the
Great
Butcher
--
it
was
the
*NL*
spirit
of
Capitalism
made
flesh
.
Upon
the
ocean
of
commerce
it
sailed
*NL*
as
a
pirate
ship
;
it
had
hoisted
the
black
flag
and
declared
war
upon
*NL*
civilization
.
Bribery
and
corruption
were
its
everyday
methods
.
In
*NL*
Chicago
the
city
government
was
simply
one
of
its
branch
offices
;
it
*NL*
stole
billions
of
gallons
of
city
water
openly
,
it
dictated
to
the
*NL*
courts
the
sentences
of
disorderly
strikers
,
it
forbade
the
mayor
to
*NL*
enforce
the
building
laws
against
it
.
In
the
national
capital
it
had
*NL*
power
to
prevent
inspection
of
its
product
,
and
to
falsify
government
*NL*
reports
;
it
violated
the
rebate
laws
,
and
when
an
investigation
was
*NL*
threatened
it
burned
its
books
and
sent
its
criminal
agents
out
of
the
*NL*
country
.
In
the
commercial
world
it
was
a
Juggernaut
car
;
it
wiped
out
*NL*
thousands
of
businesses
every
year
,
it
drove
men
to
madness
and
suicide
.
*NL*
It
had
forced
the
price
of
cattle
so
low
as
to
destroy
the
stock-raising
*NL*
industry
,
an
occupation
upon
which
whole
states
existed
;
it
had
ruined
*NL*
thousands
of
butchers
who
had
refused
to
handle
its
products
.
It
divided
*NL*
the
country
into
districts
,
and
fixed
the
price
of
meat
in
all
of
them
;
*NL*
and
it
owned
all
the
refrigerator
cars
,
and
levied
an
enormous
tribute
*NL*
upon
all
poultry
and
eggs
and
fruit
and
vegetables
.
With
the
millions
*NL*
of
dollars
a
week
that
poured
in
upon
it
,
it
was
reaching
out
for
*NL*
the
control
of
other
interests
,
railroads
and
trolley
lines
,
gas
and
*NL*
electric
light
franchises
--
it
already
owned
the
leather
and
the
grain
*NL*
business
of
the
country
.
The
people
were
tremendously
stirred
up
over
*NL*
its
encroachments
,
but
nobody
had
any
remedy
to
suggest
;
it
was
the
task
*NL*
of
Socialists
to
teach
and
organize
them
,
and
prepare
them
for
the
time
*NL*
when
they
were
to
seize
the
huge
machine
called
the
Beef
Trust
,
and
use
*NL*
it
to
produce
food
for
human
beings
and
not
to
heap
up
fortunes
for
a
*NL*
band
of
pirates
.
It
was
long
after
midnight
when
Jurgis
lay
down
upon
*NL*
the
floor
of
Ostrinski
's
kitchen
;
and
yet
it
was
an
hour
before
he
*NL*
could
get
to
sleep
,
for
the
glory
of
that
joyful
vision
of
the
people
of
*NL*
Packingtown
marching
in
and
taking
possession
of
the
Union
Stockyards
!

*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
30
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Jurgis
had
breakfast
with
Ostrinski
and
his
family
,
and
then
he
went
*NL*
home
to
Elzbieta
.
He
was
no
longer
shy
about
it
--
when
he
went
in
,
*NL*
instead
of
saying
all
the
things
he
had
been
planning
to
say
,
he
started
*NL*
to
tell
Elzbieta
about
the
revolution
!
At
first
she
thought
he
was
out
*NL*
of
his
mind
,
and
it
was
hours
before
she
could
really
feel
certain
that
*NL*
he
was
himself
.
When
,
however
,
she
had
satisfied
herself
that
he
was
*NL*
sane
upon
all
subjects
except
politics
,
she
troubled
herself
no
*NL*
further
about
it
.
Jurgis
was
destined
to
find
that
Elzbieta
's
armor
was
*NL*
absolutely
impervious
to
Socialism
.
Her
soul
had
been
baked
hard
in
the
*NL*
fire
of
adversity
,
and
there
was
no
altering
it
now
;
life
to
her
was
the
*NL*
hunt
for
daily
bread
,
and
ideas
existed
for
her
only
as
they
bore
upon
*NL*
that
.
All
that
interested
her
in
regard
to
this
new
frenzy
which
had
*NL*
seized
hold
of
her
son-in-law
was
whether
or
not
it
had
a
tendency
to
*NL*
make
him
sober
and
industrious
;
and
when
she
found
he
intended
to
look
*NL*
for
work
and
to
contribute
his
share
to
the
family
fund
,
she
gave
him
*NL*
full
rein
to
convince
her
of
anything
.
A
wonderfully
wise
little
woman
*NL*
was
Elzbieta
;
she
could
think
as
quickly
as
a
hunted
rabbit
,
and
in
half
*NL*
an
hour
she
had
chosen
her
life-attitude
to
the
Socialist
movement
.
*NL*
She
agreed
in
everything
with
Jurgis
,
except
the
need
of
his
paying
his
*NL*
dues
;
and
she
would
even
go
to
a
meeting
with
him
now
and
then
,
and
sit
*NL*
and
plan
her
next
day
's
dinner
amid
the
storm
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
week
after
he
became
a
convert
Jurgis
continued
to
wander
about
*NL*
all
day
,
looking
for
work
;
until
at
last
he
met
with
a
strange
fortune
.
*NL*
He
was
passing
one
of
Chicago
's
innumerable
small
hotels
,
and
after
some
*NL*
hesitation
he
concluded
to
go
in
.
A
man
he
took
for
the
proprietor
was
*NL*
standing
in
the
lobby
,
and
he
went
up
to
him
and
tackled
him
for
a
job
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
you
do
?
''
the
man
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anything
,
sir
,
''
said
Jurgis
,
and
added
quickly
:
``
I
've
been
out
of
work
*NL*
for
a
long
time
,
sir
.
I
'm
an
honest
man
,
and
I
'm
strong
and
willing
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
was
eying
him
narrowly
.
``
Do
you
drink
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
''
said
Jurgis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
've
been
employing
a
man
as
a
porter
,
and
he
drinks
.
I
've
*NL*
discharged
him
seven
times
now
,
and
I
've
about
made
up
my
mind
that
's
*NL*
enough
.
Would
you
be
a
porter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
hard
work
.
You
'll
have
to
clean
floors
and
wash
spittoons
and
fill
*NL*
lamps
and
handle
trunks
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
willing
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
.
I
'll
pay
you
thirty
a
month
and
board
,
and
you
can
begin
*NL*
now
,
if
you
feel
like
it
.
You
can
put
on
the
other
fellow
's
rig
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
Jurgis
fell
to
work
,
and
toiled
like
a
Trojan
till
night
.
Then
*NL*
he
went
and
told
Elzbieta
,
and
also
,
late
as
it
was
,
he
paid
a
visit
to
*NL*
Ostrinski
to
let
him
know
of
his
good
fortune
.
Here
he
received
a
great
*NL*
surprise
,
for
when
he
was
describing
the
location
of
the
hotel
Ostrinski
*NL*
interrupted
suddenly
,
``
Not
Hinds
's
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Jurgis
,
``
that
's
the
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
which
the
other
replied
,
``
Then
you
've
got
the
best
boss
in
*NL*
Chicago
--
he
's
a
state
organizer
of
our
party
,
and
one
of
our
best-known
*NL*
speakers
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
next
morning
Jurgis
went
to
his
employer
and
told
him
;
and
the
*NL*
man
seized
him
by
the
hand
and
shook
it
.
``
By
Jove
!
''
he
cried
,
``
that
lets
*NL*
me
out
.
I
did
n't
sleep
all
last
night
because
I
had
discharged
a
good
*NL*
Socialist
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
,
after
that
,
Jurgis
was
known
to
his
``
boss
''
as
``
Comrade
Jurgis
,
''
and
*NL*
in
return
he
was
expected
to
call
him
``
Comrade
Hinds
.
''
``
Tommy
''
Hinds
,
*NL*
as
he
was
known
to
his
intimates
,
was
a
squat
little
man
,
with
broad
*NL*
shoulders
and
a
florid
face
,
decorated
with
gray
side
whiskers
.
*NL*
He
was
the
kindest-hearted
man
that
ever
lived
,
and
the
*NL*
liveliest
--
inexhaustible
in
his
enthusiasm
,
and
talking
Socialism
all
*NL*
day
and
all
night
.
He
was
a
great
fellow
to
jolly
along
a
crowd
,
and
*NL*
would
keep
a
meeting
in
an
uproar
;
when
once
he
got
really
waked
up
,
the
*NL*
torrent
of
his
eloquence
could
be
compared
with
nothing
save
Niagara
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tommy
Hinds
had
begun
life
as
a
blacksmith
's
helper
,
and
had
run
away
*NL*
to
join
the
Union
army
,
where
he
had
made
his
first
acquaintance
with
*NL*
``
graft
,
''
in
the
shape
of
rotten
muskets
and
shoddy
blankets
.
To
a
*NL*
musket
that
broke
in
a
crisis
he
always
attributed
the
death
of
his
only
*NL*
brother
,
and
upon
worthless
blankets
he
blamed
all
the
agonies
of
his
*NL*
own
old
age
.
Whenever
it
rained
,
the
rheumatism
would
get
into
his
*NL*
joints
,
and
then
he
would
screw
up
his
face
and
mutter
:
``
Capitalism
,
my
*NL*
boy
,
capitalism
!
`
Ecrasez
l'infame
!
'
''
He
had
one
unfailing
remedy
for
*NL*
all
the
evils
of
this
world
,
and
he
preached
it
to
every
one
;
no
matter
*NL*
whether
the
person
's
trouble
was
failure
in
business
,
or
dyspepsia
,
or
*NL*
a
quarrelsome
mother-in-law
,
a
twinkle
would
come
into
his
eyes
and
he
*NL*
would
say
,
``
You
know
what
to
do
about
it
--
vote
the
Socialist
ticket
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tommy
Hinds
had
set
out
upon
the
trail
of
the
Octopus
as
soon
as
the
war
*NL*
was
over
.
He
had
gone
into
business
,
and
found
himself
in
competition
*NL*
with
the
fortunes
of
those
who
had
been
stealing
while
he
had
been
*NL*
fighting
.
The
city
government
was
in
their
hands
and
the
railroads
were
*NL*
in
league
with
them
,
and
honest
business
was
driven
to
the
wall
;
and
*NL*
so
Hinds
had
put
all
his
savings
into
Chicago
real
estate
,
and
set
out
*NL*
singlehanded
to
dam
the
river
of
graft
.
He
had
been
a
reform
member
*NL*
of
the
city
council
,
he
had
been
a
Greenbacker
,
a
Labor
Unionist
,
a
*NL*
Populist
,
a
Bryanite
--
and
after
thirty
years
of
fighting
,
the
year
1896
*NL*
had
served
to
convince
him
that
the
power
of
concentrated
wealth
could
*NL*
never
be
controlled
,
but
could
only
be
destroyed
.
He
had
published
a
*NL*
pamphlet
about
it
,
and
set
out
to
organize
a
party
of
his
own
,
when
a
*NL*
stray
Socialist
leaflet
had
revealed
to
him
that
others
had
been
*NL*
ahead
of
him
.
Now
for
eight
years
he
had
been
fighting
for
the
*NL*
party
,
anywhere
,
everywhere
--
whether
it
was
a
G.A.R.
reunion
,
or
a
*NL*
hotel-keepers
'
convention
,
or
an
Afro-American
business-men
's
banquet
,
or
*NL*
a
Bible
society
picnic
,
Tommy
Hinds
would
manage
to
get
himself
invited
*NL*
to
explain
the
relations
of
Socialism
to
the
subject
in
hand
.
After
that
*NL*
he
would
start
off
upon
a
tour
of
his
own
,
ending
at
some
place
between
*NL*
New
York
and
Oregon
;
and
when
he
came
back
from
there
,
he
would
go
out
*NL*
to
organize
new
locals
for
the
state
committee
;
and
finally
he
would
*NL*
come
home
to
rest
--
and
talk
Socialism
in
Chicago
.
Hinds
's
hotel
was
a
*NL*
very
hot-bed
of
the
propaganda
;
all
the
employees
were
party
men
,
and
if
*NL*
they
were
not
when
they
came
,
they
were
quite
certain
to
be
before
they
*NL*
went
away
.
The
proprietor
would
get
into
a
discussion
with
some
one
in
*NL*
the
lobby
,
and
as
the
conversation
grew
animated
,
others
would
gather
*NL*
about
to
listen
,
until
finally
every
one
in
the
place
would
be
crowded
*NL*
into
a
group
,
and
a
regular
debate
would
be
under
way
.
This
went
on
*NL*
every
night
--
when
Tommy
Hinds
was
not
there
to
do
it
,
his
clerk
did
it
;
*NL*
and
when
his
clerk
was
away
campaigning
,
the
assistant
attended
to
it
,
*NL*
while
Mrs.
Hinds
sat
behind
the
desk
and
did
the
work
.
The
clerk
was
an
*NL*
old
crony
of
the
proprietor
's
,
an
awkward
,
rawboned
giant
of
a
man
,
with
*NL*
a
lean
,
sallow
face
,
a
broad
mouth
,
and
whiskers
under
his
chin
,
*NL*
the
very
type
and
body
of
a
prairie
farmer
.
He
had
been
that
all
his
*NL*
life
--
he
had
fought
the
railroads
in
Kansas
for
fifty
years
,
a
Granger
,
*NL*
a
Farmers
'
Alliance
man
,
a
``
middle-of-the-road
''
Populist
.
Finally
,
Tommy
*NL*
Hinds
had
revealed
to
him
the
wonderful
idea
of
using
the
trusts
instead
*NL*
of
destroying
them
,
and
he
had
sold
his
farm
and
come
to
Chicago
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
Amos
Struver
;
and
then
there
was
Harry
Adams
,
the
assistant
*NL*
clerk
,
a
pale
,
scholarly-looking
man
,
who
came
from
Massachusetts
,
of
*NL*
Pilgrim
stock
.
Adams
had
been
a
cotton
operative
in
Fall
River
,
and
the
*NL*
continued
depression
in
the
industry
had
worn
him
and
his
family
out
,
*NL*
and
he
had
emigrated
to
South
Carolina
.
In
Massachusetts
the
percentage
*NL*
of
white
illiteracy
is
eight-tenths
of
one
per
cent
,
while
in
South
*NL*
Carolina
it
is
thirteen
and
six-tenths
per
cent
;
also
in
South
Carolina
*NL*
there
is
a
property
qualification
for
voters
--
and
for
these
and
other
*NL*
reasons
child
labor
is
the
rule
,
and
so
the
cotton
mills
were
driving
*NL*
those
of
Massachusetts
out
of
the
business
.
Adams
did
not
know
this
,
he
*NL*
only
knew
that
the
Southern
mills
were
running
;
but
when
he
got
there
*NL*
he
found
that
if
he
was
to
live
,
all
his
family
would
have
to
work
,
and
*NL*
from
six
o'clock
at
night
to
six
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
So
he
had
set
*NL*
to
work
to
organize
the
mill
hands
,
after
the
fashion
in
Massachusetts
,
*NL*
and
had
been
discharged
;
but
he
had
gotten
other
work
,
and
stuck
at
it
,
*NL*
and
at
last
there
had
been
a
strike
for
shorter
hours
,
and
Harry
Adams
*NL*
had
attempted
to
address
a
street
meeting
,
which
was
the
end
of
him
.
*NL*
In
the
states
of
the
far
South
the
labor
of
convicts
is
leased
to
*NL*
contractors
,
and
when
there
are
not
convicts
enough
they
have
to
be
*NL*
supplied
.
Harry
Adams
was
sent
up
by
a
judge
who
was
a
cousin
of
the
*NL*
mill
owner
with
whose
business
he
had
interfered
;
and
though
the
life
*NL*
had
nearly
killed
him
,
he
had
been
wise
enough
not
to
murmur
,
and
at
*NL*
the
end
of
his
term
he
and
his
family
had
left
the
state
of
South
*NL*
Carolina
--
hell
's
back
yard
,
as
he
called
it
.
He
had
no
money
for
*NL*
carfare
,
but
it
was
harvest-time
,
and
they
walked
one
day
and
worked
*NL*
the
next
;
and
so
Adams
got
at
last
to
Chicago
,
and
joined
the
Socialist
*NL*
party
.
He
was
a
studious
man
,
reserved
,
and
nothing
of
an
orator
;
but
*NL*
he
always
had
a
pile
of
books
under
his
desk
in
the
hotel
,
and
articles
*NL*
from
his
pen
were
beginning
to
attract
attention
in
the
party
press
.
*NL*
*NL*
Contrary
to
what
one
would
have
expected
,
all
this
radicalism
did
not
*NL*
hurt
the
hotel
business
;
the
radicals
flocked
to
it
,
and
the
commercial
*NL*
travelers
all
found
it
diverting
.
Of
late
,
also
,
the
hotel
had
become
a
*NL*
favorite
stopping
place
for
Western
cattlemen
.
Now
that
the
Beef
Trust
*NL*
had
adopted
the
trick
of
raising
prices
to
induce
enormous
shipments
of
*NL*
cattle
,
and
then
dropping
them
again
and
scooping
in
all
they
needed
,
*NL*
a
stock
raiser
was
very
apt
to
find
himself
in
Chicago
without
money
*NL*
enough
to
pay
his
freight
bill
;
and
so
he
had
to
go
to
a
cheap
hotel
,
*NL*
and
it
was
no
drawback
to
him
if
there
was
an
agitator
talking
in
the
*NL*
lobby
.
These
Western
fellows
were
just
``
meat
''
for
Tommy
Hinds
--
he
*NL*
would
get
a
dozen
of
them
around
him
and
paint
little
pictures
of
``
the
*NL*
System
.
''
Of
course
,
it
was
not
a
week
before
he
had
heard
Jurgis
's
*NL*
story
,
and
after
that
he
would
not
have
let
his
new
porter
go
for
the
*NL*
world
.
``
See
here
,
''
he
would
say
,
in
the
middle
of
an
argument
,
``
I
've
got
*NL*
a
fellow
right
here
in
my
place
who
's
worked
there
and
seen
every
bit
of
*NL*
it
!
''
And
then
Jurgis
would
drop
his
work
,
whatever
it
was
,
and
come
,
and
*NL*
the
other
would
say
,
``
Comrade
Jurgis
,
just
tell
these
gentlemen
what
you
*NL*
saw
on
the
killing-beds
.
''
At
first
this
request
caused
poor
Jurgis
the
*NL*
most
acute
agony
,
and
it
was
like
pulling
teeth
to
get
him
to
talk
;
but
*NL*
gradually
he
found
out
what
was
wanted
,
and
in
the
end
he
learned
to
*NL*
stand
up
and
speak
his
piece
with
enthusiasm
.
His
employer
would
sit
by
*NL*
and
encourage
him
with
exclamations
and
shakes
of
the
head
;
when
Jurgis
*NL*
would
give
the
formula
for
``
potted
ham
,
''
or
tell
about
the
condemned
*NL*
hogs
that
were
dropped
into
the
``
destructors
''
at
the
top
and
immediately
*NL*
taken
out
again
at
the
bottom
,
to
be
shipped
into
another
state
and
made
*NL*
into
lard
,
Tommy
Hinds
would
bang
his
knee
and
cry
,
``
Do
you
think
a
man
*NL*
could
make
up
a
thing
like
that
out
of
his
head
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
the
hotel-keeper
would
go
on
to
show
how
the
Socialists
had
the
*NL*
only
real
remedy
for
such
evils
,
how
they
alone
``
meant
business
''
with
*NL*
the
Beef
Trust
.
And
when
,
in
answer
to
this
,
the
victim
would
say
that
*NL*
the
whole
country
was
getting
stirred
up
,
that
the
newspapers
were
full
*NL*
of
denunciations
of
it
,
and
the
government
taking
action
against
it
,
*NL*
Tommy
Hinds
had
a
knock-out
blow
all
ready
.
``
Yes
,
''
he
would
say
,
``
all
*NL*
that
is
true
--
but
what
do
you
suppose
is
the
reason
for
it
?
Are
you
*NL*
foolish
enough
to
believe
that
it
's
done
for
the
public
?
There
are
*NL*
other
trusts
in
the
country
just
as
illegal
and
extortionate
as
the
Beef
*NL*
Trust
:
there
is
the
Coal
Trust
,
that
freezes
the
poor
in
winter
--
there
*NL*
is
the
Steel
Trust
,
that
doubles
the
price
of
every
nail
in
your
*NL*
shoes
--
there
is
the
Oil
Trust
,
that
keeps
you
from
reading
at
night
--
and
*NL*
why
do
you
suppose
it
is
that
all
the
fury
of
the
press
and
the
*NL*
government
is
directed
against
the
Beef
Trust
?
''
And
when
to
this
the
*NL*
victim
would
reply
that
there
was
clamor
enough
over
the
Oil
Trust
,
the
*NL*
other
would
continue
:
``
Ten
years
ago
Henry
D.
Lloyd
told
all
the
truth
*NL*
about
the
Standard
Oil
Company
in
his
Wealth
versus
Commonwealth
;
and
*NL*
the
book
was
allowed
to
die
,
and
you
hardly
ever
hear
of
it
.
And
now
,
at
*NL*
last
,
two
magazines
have
the
courage
to
tackle
`
Standard
Oil
'
again
,
and
*NL*
what
happens
?
The
newspapers
ridicule
the
authors
,
the
churches
defend
*NL*
the
criminals
,
and
the
government
--
does
nothing
.
And
now
,
why
is
it
all
*NL*
so
different
with
the
Beef
Trust
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
other
would
generally
admit
that
he
was
``
stuck
''
;
and
Tommy
*NL*
Hinds
would
explain
to
him
,
and
it
was
fun
to
see
his
eyes
open
.
``
If
you
*NL*
were
a
Socialist
,
''
the
hotel-keeper
would
say
,
``
you
would
understand
that
*NL*
the
power
which
really
governs
the
United
States
today
is
the
Railroad
*NL*
Trust
.
It
is
the
Railroad
Trust
that
runs
your
state
government
,
*NL*
wherever
you
live
,
and
that
runs
the
United
States
Senate
.
And
all
of
*NL*
the
trusts
that
I
have
named
are
railroad
trusts
--
save
only
the
Beef
*NL*
Trust
!
The
Beef
Trust
has
defied
the
railroads
--
it
is
plundering
them
*NL*
day
by
day
through
the
Private
Car
;
and
so
the
public
is
roused
to
*NL*
fury
,
and
the
papers
clamor
for
action
,
and
the
government
goes
on
the
*NL*
war-path
!
And
you
poor
common
people
watch
and
applaud
the
job
,
and
*NL*
think
it
's
all
done
for
you
,
and
never
dream
that
it
is
really
the
grand
*NL*
climax
of
the
century-long
battle
of
commercial
competition
--
the
final
*NL*
death
grapple
between
the
chiefs
of
the
Beef
Trust
and
`
Standard
Oil
,
'
*NL*
for
the
prize
of
the
mastery
and
ownership
of
the
United
States
of
*NL*
America
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
the
new
home
in
which
Jurgis
lived
and
worked
,
and
in
which
his
*NL*
education
was
completed
.
Perhaps
you
would
imagine
that
he
did
not
do
*NL*
much
work
there
,
but
that
would
be
a
great
mistake
.
He
would
have
cut
*NL*
off
one
hand
for
Tommy
Hinds
;
and
to
keep
Hinds
's
hotel
a
thing
of
*NL*
beauty
was
his
joy
in
life
.
That
he
had
a
score
of
Socialist
arguments
*NL*
chasing
through
his
brain
in
the
meantime
did
not
interfere
with
*NL*
this
;
on
the
contrary
,
Jurgis
scrubbed
the
spittoons
and
polished
*NL*
the
banisters
all
the
more
vehemently
because
at
the
same
time
he
was
*NL*
wrestling
inwardly
with
an
imaginary
recalcitrant
.
It
would
be
pleasant
*NL*
to
record
that
he
swore
off
drinking
immediately
,
and
all
the
rest
*NL*
of
his
bad
habits
with
it
;
but
that
would
hardly
be
exact
.
These
*NL*
revolutionists
were
not
angels
;
they
were
men
,
and
men
who
had
come
up
*NL*
from
the
social
pit
,
and
with
the
mire
of
it
smeared
over
them
.
Some
of
*NL*
them
drank
,
and
some
of
them
swore
,
and
some
of
them
ate
pie
with
their
*NL*
knives
;
there
was
only
one
difference
between
them
and
all
the
rest
of
*NL*
the
populace
--
that
they
were
men
with
a
hope
,
with
a
cause
to
fight
*NL*
for
and
suffer
for
.
There
came
times
to
Jurgis
when
the
vision
seemed
*NL*
far-off
and
pale
,
and
a
glass
of
beer
loomed
large
in
comparison
;
but
*NL*
if
the
glass
led
to
another
glass
,
and
to
too
many
glasses
,
he
had
*NL*
something
to
spur
him
to
remorse
and
resolution
on
the
morrow
.
It
was
*NL*
so
evidently
a
wicked
thing
to
spend
one
's
pennies
for
drink
,
when
the
*NL*
working
class
was
wandering
in
darkness
,
and
waiting
to
be
delivered
;
*NL*
the
price
of
a
glass
of
beer
would
buy
fifty
copies
of
a
leaflet
,
and
*NL*
one
could
hand
these
out
to
the
unregenerate
,
and
then
get
drunk
upon
*NL*
the
thought
of
the
good
that
was
being
accomplished
.
That
was
the
way
*NL*
the
movement
had
been
made
,
and
it
was
the
only
way
it
would
progress
;
*NL*
it
availed
nothing
to
know
of
it
,
without
fighting
for
it
--
it
was
a
*NL*
thing
for
all
,
not
for
a
few
!
A
corollary
of
this
proposition
of
course
*NL*
was
,
that
any
one
who
refused
to
receive
the
new
gospel
was
personally
*NL*
responsible
for
keeping
Jurgis
from
his
heart
's
desire
;
and
this
,
alas
,
*NL*
made
him
uncomfortable
as
an
acquaintance
.
He
met
some
neighbors
with
*NL*
whom
Elzbieta
had
made
friends
in
her
neighborhood
,
and
he
set
out
to
*NL*
make
Socialists
of
them
by
wholesale
,
and
several
times
he
all
but
got
*NL*
into
a
fight
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
all
so
painfully
obvious
to
Jurgis
!
It
was
so
incomprehensible
*NL*
how
a
man
could
fail
to
see
it
!
Here
were
all
the
opportunities
of
the
*NL*
country
,
the
land
,
and
the
buildings
upon
the
land
,
the
railroads
,
the
*NL*
mines
,
the
factories
,
and
the
stores
,
all
in
the
hands
of
a
few
private
*NL*
individuals
,
called
capitalists
,
for
whom
the
people
were
obliged
to
*NL*
work
for
wages
.
The
whole
balance
of
what
the
people
produced
went
to
*NL*
heap
up
the
fortunes
of
these
capitalists
,
to
heap
,
and
heap
again
,
and
*NL*
yet
again
--
and
that
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
they
,
and
every
one
about
*NL*
them
,
lived
in
unthinkable
luxury
!
And
was
it
not
plain
that
if
the
*NL*
people
cut
off
the
share
of
those
who
merely
``
owned
,
''
the
share
of
those
*NL*
who
worked
would
be
much
greater
?
That
was
as
plain
as
two
and
two
makes
*NL*
four
;
and
it
was
the
whole
of
it
,
absolutely
the
whole
of
it
;
and
yet
*NL*
there
were
people
who
could
not
see
it
,
who
would
argue
about
everything
*NL*
else
in
the
world
.
They
would
tell
you
that
governments
could
not
manage
*NL*
things
as
economically
as
private
individuals
;
they
would
repeat
and
*NL*
repeat
that
,
and
think
they
were
saying
something
!
They
could
not
see
*NL*
that
``
economical
''
management
by
masters
meant
simply
that
they
,
the
*NL*
people
,
were
worked
harder
and
ground
closer
and
paid
less
!
They
were
*NL*
wage-earners
and
servants
,
at
the
mercy
of
exploiters
whose
one
thought
*NL*
was
to
get
as
much
out
of
them
as
possible
;
and
they
were
taking
*NL*
an
interest
in
the
process
,
were
anxious
lest
it
should
not
be
done
*NL*
thoroughly
enough
!
Was
it
not
honestly
a
trial
to
listen
to
an
argument
*NL*
such
as
that
?
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
there
were
things
even
worse
.
You
would
begin
talking
to
some
*NL*
poor
devil
who
had
worked
in
one
shop
for
the
last
thirty
years
,
and
*NL*
had
never
been
able
to
save
a
penny
;
who
left
home
every
morning
at
six
*NL*
o'clock
,
to
go
and
tend
a
machine
,
and
come
back
at
night
too
tired
to
*NL*
take
his
clothes
off
;
who
had
never
had
a
week
's
vacation
in
his
life
,
*NL*
had
never
traveled
,
never
had
an
adventure
,
never
learned
anything
,
*NL*
never
hoped
anything
--
and
when
you
started
to
tell
him
about
*NL*
Socialism
he
would
sniff
and
say
,
``
I
'm
not
interested
in
that
--
I
'm
an
*NL*
individualist
!
''
And
then
he
would
go
on
to
tell
you
that
Socialism
was
*NL*
``
paternalism
,
''
and
that
if
it
ever
had
its
way
the
world
would
stop
*NL*
progressing
.
It
was
enough
to
make
a
mule
laugh
,
to
hear
arguments
like
*NL*
that
;
and
yet
it
was
no
laughing
matter
,
as
you
found
out
--
for
how
many
*NL*
millions
of
such
poor
deluded
wretches
there
were
,
whose
lives
had
been
*NL*
so
stunted
by
capitalism
that
they
no
longer
knew
what
freedom
was
!
And
*NL*
they
really
thought
that
it
was
``
individualism
''
for
tens
of
thousands
*NL*
of
them
to
herd
together
and
obey
the
orders
of
a
steel
magnate
,
and
*NL*
produce
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
of
wealth
for
him
,
and
then
let
*NL*
him
give
them
libraries
;
while
for
them
to
take
the
industry
,
and
run
it
*NL*
to
suit
themselves
,
and
build
their
own
libraries
--
that
would
have
been
*NL*
``
Paternalism
''
!
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
the
agony
of
such
things
as
this
was
almost
more
than
Jurgis
*NL*
could
bear
;
yet
there
was
no
way
of
escape
from
it
,
there
was
nothing
*NL*
to
do
but
to
dig
away
at
the
base
of
this
mountain
of
ignorance
and
*NL*
prejudice
.
You
must
keep
at
the
poor
fellow
;
you
must
hold
your
temper
,
*NL*
and
argue
with
him
,
and
watch
for
your
chance
to
stick
an
idea
or
*NL*
two
into
his
head
.
And
the
rest
of
the
time
you
must
sharpen
up
your
*NL*
weapons
--
you
must
think
out
new
replies
to
his
objections
,
and
provide
*NL*
yourself
with
new
facts
to
prove
to
him
the
folly
of
his
ways
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
Jurgis
acquired
the
reading
habit
.
He
would
carry
in
his
pocket
a
*NL*
tract
or
a
pamphlet
which
some
one
had
loaned
him
,
and
whenever
he
had
*NL*
an
idle
moment
during
the
day
he
would
plod
through
a
paragraph
,
and
*NL*
then
think
about
it
while
he
worked
.
Also
he
read
the
newspapers
,
and
*NL*
asked
questions
about
them
.
One
of
the
other
porters
at
Hinds
's
was
a
*NL*
sharp
little
Irishman
,
who
knew
everything
that
Jurgis
wanted
to
know
;
*NL*
and
while
they
were
busy
he
would
explain
to
him
the
geography
of
*NL*
America
,
and
its
history
,
its
constitution
and
its
laws
;
also
he
gave
*NL*
him
an
idea
of
the
business
system
of
the
country
,
the
great
railroads
*NL*
and
corporations
,
and
who
owned
them
,
and
the
labor
unions
,
and
the
big
*NL*
strikes
,
and
the
men
who
had
led
them
.
Then
at
night
,
when
he
could
get
*NL*
off
,
Jurgis
would
attend
the
Socialist
meetings
.
During
the
campaign
one
*NL*
was
not
dependent
upon
the
street
corner
affairs
,
where
the
weather
*NL*
and
the
quality
of
the
orator
were
equally
uncertain
;
there
were
*NL*
hall
meetings
every
night
,
and
one
could
hear
speakers
of
national
*NL*
prominence
.
These
discussed
the
political
situation
from
every
point
of
*NL*
view
,
and
all
that
troubled
Jurgis
was
the
impossibility
of
carrying
off
*NL*
but
a
small
part
of
the
treasures
they
offered
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
man
who
was
known
in
the
party
as
the
``
Little
Giant
.
''
The
*NL*
Lord
had
used
up
so
much
material
in
the
making
of
his
head
that
there
*NL*
had
not
been
enough
to
complete
his
legs
;
but
he
got
about
on
the
*NL*
platform
,
and
when
he
shook
his
raven
whiskers
the
pillars
of
capitalism
*NL*
rocked
.
He
had
written
a
veritable
encyclopedia
upon
the
subject
,
a
book
*NL*
that
was
nearly
as
big
as
himself
--
And
then
there
was
a
young
*NL*
author
,
who
came
from
California
,
and
had
been
a
salmon
fisher
,
an
*NL*
oyster-pirate
,
a
longshoreman
,
a
sailor
;
who
had
tramped
the
country
and
*NL*
been
sent
to
jail
,
had
lived
in
the
Whitechapel
slums
,
and
been
to
the
*NL*
Klondike
in
search
of
gold
.
All
these
things
he
pictured
in
his
books
,
*NL*
and
because
he
was
a
man
of
genius
he
forced
the
world
to
hear
him
.
Now
*NL*
he
was
famous
,
but
wherever
he
went
he
still
preached
the
gospel
of
*NL*
the
poor
.
And
then
there
was
one
who
was
known
at
the
``
millionaire
*NL*
Socialist
.
''
He
had
made
a
fortune
in
business
,
and
spent
nearly
all
of
*NL*
it
in
building
up
a
magazine
,
which
the
post
office
department
had
tried
*NL*
to
suppress
,
and
had
driven
to
Canada
.
He
was
a
quiet-mannered
man
,
whom
*NL*
you
would
have
taken
for
anything
in
the
world
but
a
Socialist
agitator
.
*NL*
His
speech
was
simple
and
informal
--
he
could
not
understand
why
any
*NL*
one
should
get
excited
about
these
things
.
It
was
a
process
of
economic
*NL*
evolution
,
he
said
,
and
he
exhibited
its
laws
and
methods
.
Life
was
a
*NL*
struggle
for
existence
,
and
the
strong
overcame
the
weak
,
and
in
turn
*NL*
were
overcome
by
the
strongest
.
Those
who
lost
in
the
struggle
were
*NL*
generally
exterminated
;
but
now
and
then
they
had
been
known
to
save
*NL*
themselves
by
combination
--
which
was
a
new
and
higher
kind
of
strength
.
*NL*
It
was
so
that
the
gregarious
animals
had
overcome
the
predaceous
;
it
*NL*
was
so
,
in
human
history
,
that
the
people
had
mastered
the
kings
.
The
*NL*
workers
were
simply
the
citizens
of
industry
,
and
the
Socialist
movement
*NL*
was
the
expression
of
their
will
to
survive
.
The
inevitability
of
the
*NL*
revolution
depended
upon
this
fact
,
that
they
had
no
choice
but
to
unite
*NL*
or
be
exterminated
;
this
fact
,
grim
and
inexorable
,
depended
upon
no
*NL*
human
will
,
it
was
the
law
of
the
economic
process
,
of
which
the
editor
*NL*
showed
the
details
with
the
most
marvelous
precision
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
later
on
came
the
evening
of
the
great
meeting
of
the
campaign
,
when
*NL*
Jurgis
heard
the
two
standard-bearers
of
his
party
.
Ten
years
before
*NL*
there
had
been
in
Chicago
a
strike
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
*NL*
railroad
employees
,
and
thugs
had
been
hired
by
the
railroads
to
commit
*NL*
violence
,
and
the
President
of
the
United
States
had
sent
in
troops
*NL*
to
break
the
strike
,
by
flinging
the
officers
of
the
union
into
jail
*NL*
without
trial
.
The
president
of
the
union
came
out
of
his
cell
a
ruined
*NL*
man
;
but
also
he
came
out
a
Socialist
;
and
now
for
just
ten
years
he
had
*NL*
been
traveling
up
and
down
the
country
,
standing
face
to
face
with
the
*NL*
people
,
and
pleading
with
them
for
justice
.
He
was
a
man
of
electric
*NL*
presence
,
tall
and
gaunt
,
with
a
face
worn
thin
by
struggle
and
*NL*
suffering
.
The
fury
of
outraged
manhood
gleamed
in
it
--
and
the
tears
of
*NL*
suffering
little
children
pleaded
in
his
voice
.
When
he
spoke
he
paced
*NL*
the
stage
,
lithe
and
eager
,
like
a
panther
.
He
leaned
over
,
reaching
out
*NL*
for
his
audience
;
he
pointed
into
their
souls
with
an
insistent
finger
.
*NL*
His
voice
was
husky
from
much
speaking
,
but
the
great
auditorium
was
as
*NL*
still
as
death
,
and
every
one
heard
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
,
as
Jurgis
came
out
from
this
meeting
,
some
one
handed
him
*NL*
a
paper
which
he
carried
home
with
him
and
read
;
and
so
he
became
*NL*
acquainted
with
the
``
Appeal
to
Reason
.
''
About
twelve
years
previously
a
*NL*
Colorado
real-estate
speculator
had
made
up
his
mind
that
it
was
wrong
*NL*
to
gamble
in
the
necessities
of
life
of
human
beings
:
and
so
he
had
*NL*
retired
and
begun
the
publication
of
a
Socialist
weekly
.
There
had
come
*NL*
a
time
when
he
had
to
set
his
own
type
,
but
he
had
held
on
and
won
out
,
*NL*
and
now
his
publication
was
an
institution
.
It
used
a
carload
of
paper
*NL*
every
week
,
and
the
mail
trains
would
be
hours
loading
up
at
the
depot
*NL*
of
the
little
Kansas
town
.
It
was
a
four-page
weekly
,
which
sold
for
*NL*
less
than
half
a
cent
a
copy
;
its
regular
subscription
list
was
a
*NL*
quarter
of
a
million
,
and
it
went
to
every
crossroads
post
office
in
*NL*
America
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
``
Appeal
''
was
a
``
propaganda
''
paper
.
It
had
a
manner
all
its
own
--
it
*NL*
was
full
of
ginger
and
spice
,
of
Western
slang
and
hustle
:
It
collected
*NL*
news
of
the
doings
of
the
``
plutes
,
''
and
served
it
up
for
the
benefit
*NL*
of
the
``
American
working-mule
.
''
It
would
have
columns
of
the
deadly
*NL*
parallel
--
the
million
dollars
'
worth
of
diamonds
,
or
the
fancy
*NL*
pet-poodle
establishment
of
a
society
dame
,
beside
the
fate
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Murphy
of
San
Francisco
,
who
had
starved
to
death
on
the
streets
,
or
of
*NL*
John
Robinson
,
just
out
of
the
hospital
,
who
had
hanged
himself
in
New
*NL*
York
because
he
could
not
find
work
.
It
collected
the
stories
of
graft
*NL*
and
misery
from
the
daily
press
,
and
made
a
little
pungent
paragraphs
*NL*
out
of
them
.
``
Three
banks
of
Bungtown
,
South
Dakota
,
failed
,
and
*NL*
more
savings
of
the
workers
swallowed
up
!
''
``
The
mayor
of
Sandy
Creek
,
*NL*
Oklahoma
,
has
skipped
with
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
.
That
's
the
kind
*NL*
of
rulers
the
old
partyites
give
you
!
''
``
The
president
of
the
Florida
*NL*
Flying
Machine
Company
is
in
jail
for
bigamy
.
He
was
a
prominent
*NL*
opponent
of
Socialism
,
which
he
said
would
break
up
the
home
!
''
The
*NL*
``
Appeal
''
had
what
it
called
its
``
Army
,
''
about
thirty
thousand
of
the
*NL*
faithful
,
who
did
things
for
it
;
and
it
was
always
exhorting
the
``
Army
''
*NL*
to
keep
its
dander
up
,
and
occasionally
encouraging
it
with
a
prize
*NL*
competition
,
for
anything
from
a
gold
watch
to
a
private
yacht
or
an
*NL*
eighty-acre
farm
.
Its
office
helpers
were
all
known
to
the
``
Army
''
by
*NL*
quaint
titles
--
``
Inky
Ike
,
''
``
the
Bald-headed
Man
,
''
``
the
Redheaded
Girl
,
''
*NL*
``
the
Bulldog
,
''
``
the
Office
Goat
,
''
and
``
the
One
Hoss
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
sometimes
,
again
,
the
``
Appeal
''
would
be
desperately
serious
.
It
sent
*NL*
a
correspondent
to
Colorado
,
and
printed
pages
describing
the
overthrow
*NL*
of
American
institutions
in
that
state
.
In
a
certain
city
of
the
country
*NL*
it
had
over
forty
of
its
``
Army
''
in
the
headquarters
of
the
Telegraph
*NL*
Trust
,
and
no
message
of
importance
to
Socialists
ever
went
through
that
*NL*
a
copy
of
it
did
not
go
to
the
``
Appeal
.
''
It
would
print
great
broadsides
*NL*
during
the
campaign
;
one
copy
that
came
to
Jurgis
was
a
manifesto
*NL*
addressed
to
striking
workingmen
,
of
which
nearly
a
million
copies
had
*NL*
been
distributed
in
the
industrial
centers
,
wherever
the
employers
'
*NL*
associations
had
been
carrying
out
their
``
open
shop
''
program
.
``
You
have
*NL*
lost
the
strike
!
''
it
was
headed
.
``
And
now
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
*NL*
it
?
''
It
was
what
is
called
an
``
incendiary
''
appeal
--
it
was
written
by
a
*NL*
man
into
whose
soul
the
iron
had
entered
.
When
this
edition
appeared
,
*NL*
twenty
thousand
copies
were
sent
to
the
stockyards
district
;
and
they
*NL*
were
taken
out
and
stowed
away
in
the
rear
of
a
little
cigar
store
,
and
*NL*
every
evening
,
and
on
Sundays
,
the
members
of
the
Packingtown
locals
*NL*
would
get
armfuls
and
distribute
them
on
the
streets
and
in
the
houses
.
*NL*
The
people
of
Packingtown
had
lost
their
strike
,
if
ever
a
people
had
,
*NL*
and
so
they
read
these
papers
gladly
,
and
twenty
thousand
were
hardly
*NL*
enough
to
go
round
.
Jurgis
had
resolved
not
to
go
near
his
old
home
*NL*
again
,
but
when
he
heard
of
this
it
was
too
much
for
him
,
and
every
*NL*
night
for
a
week
he
would
get
on
the
car
and
ride
out
to
the
stockyards
,
*NL*
and
help
to
undo
his
work
of
the
previous
year
,
when
he
had
sent
Mike
*NL*
Scully
's
ten-pin
setter
to
the
city
Board
of
Aldermen
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
quite
marvelous
to
see
what
a
difference
twelve
months
had
*NL*
made
in
Packingtown
--
the
eyes
of
the
people
were
getting
opened
!
The
*NL*
Socialists
were
literally
sweeping
everything
before
them
that
election
,
*NL*
and
Scully
and
the
Cook
County
machine
were
at
their
wits
'
end
for
an
*NL*
``
issue
.
''
At
the
very
close
of
the
campaign
they
bethought
themselves
of
*NL*
the
fact
that
the
strike
had
been
broken
by
Negroes
,
and
so
they
sent
*NL*
for
a
South
Carolina
fire-eater
,
the
``
pitchfork
senator
,
''
as
he
was
*NL*
called
,
a
man
who
took
off
his
coat
when
he
talked
to
workingmen
,
*NL*
and
damned
and
swore
like
a
Hessian
.
This
meeting
they
advertised
*NL*
extensively
,
and
the
Socialists
advertised
it
too
--
with
the
result
*NL*
that
about
a
thousand
of
them
were
on
hand
that
evening
.
The
``
pitchfork
*NL*
senator
''
stood
their
fusillade
of
questions
for
about
an
hour
,
and
then
*NL*
went
home
in
disgust
,
and
the
balance
of
the
meeting
was
a
strictly
*NL*
party
affair
.
Jurgis
,
who
had
insisted
upon
coming
,
had
the
time
of
*NL*
his
life
that
night
;
he
danced
about
and
waved
his
arms
in
his
*NL*
excitement
--
and
at
the
very
climax
he
broke
loose
from
his
friends
,
*NL*
and
got
out
into
the
aisle
,
and
proceeded
to
make
a
speech
himself
!
The
*NL*
senator
had
been
denying
that
the
Democratic
party
was
corrupt
;
it
*NL*
was
always
the
Republicans
who
bought
the
votes
,
he
said
--
and
here
was
*NL*
Jurgis
shouting
furiously
,
``
It
's
a
lie
!
It
's
a
lie
!
''
After
which
he
went
*NL*
on
to
tell
them
how
he
knew
it
--
that
he
knew
it
because
he
had
bought
*NL*
them
himself
!
And
he
would
have
told
the
``
pitchfork
senator
''
all
his
*NL*
experiences
,
had
not
Harry
Adams
and
a
friend
grabbed
him
about
the
neck
*NL*
and
shoved
him
into
a
seat
.

Chapter
31
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
first
things
that
Jurgis
had
done
after
he
got
a
job
was
to
*NL*
go
and
see
Marija
.
She
came
down
into
the
basement
of
the
house
to
meet
*NL*
him
,
and
he
stood
by
the
door
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
,
saying
,
``
I
've
*NL*
got
work
now
,
and
so
you
can
leave
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Marija
only
shook
her
head
.
There
was
nothing
else
for
her
to
*NL*
do
,
she
said
,
and
nobody
to
employ
her
.
She
could
not
keep
her
past
a
*NL*
secret
--
girls
had
tried
it
,
and
they
were
always
found
out
.
There
were
*NL*
thousands
of
men
who
came
to
this
place
,
and
sooner
or
later
she
would
*NL*
meet
one
of
them
.
``
And
besides
,
''
Marija
added
,
``
I
ca
n't
do
anything
.
I
'm
*NL*
no
good
--
I
take
dope
.
What
could
you
do
with
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ca
n't
you
stop
?
''
Jurgis
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
answered
,
``
I
'll
never
stop
.
What
's
the
use
of
talking
about
*NL*
it
--
I
'll
stay
here
till
I
die
,
I
guess
.
It
's
all
I
'm
fit
for
.
''
And
that
*NL*
was
all
that
he
could
get
her
to
say
--
there
was
no
use
trying
.
When
*NL*
he
told
her
he
would
not
let
Elzbieta
take
her
money
,
she
answered
*NL*
indifferently
:
``
Then
it
'll
be
wasted
here
--
that
's
all
.
''
Her
eyelids
*NL*
looked
heavy
and
her
face
was
red
and
swollen
;
he
saw
that
he
was
*NL*
annoying
her
,
that
she
only
wanted
him
to
go
away
.
So
he
went
,
*NL*
disappointed
and
sad
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Jurgis
was
not
very
happy
in
his
home-life
.
Elzbieta
was
sick
a
*NL*
good
deal
now
,
and
the
boys
were
wild
and
unruly
,
and
very
much
the
*NL*
worse
for
their
life
upon
the
streets
.
But
he
stuck
by
the
family
*NL*
nevertheless
,
for
they
reminded
him
of
his
old
happiness
;
and
when
*NL*
things
went
wrong
he
could
solace
himself
with
a
plunge
into
the
*NL*
Socialist
movement
.
Since
his
life
had
been
caught
up
into
the
current
*NL*
of
this
great
stream
,
things
which
had
before
been
the
whole
of
life
*NL*
to
him
came
to
seem
of
relatively
slight
importance
;
his
interests
were
*NL*
elsewhere
,
in
the
world
of
ideas
.
His
outward
life
was
commonplace
and
*NL*
uninteresting
;
he
was
just
a
hotel-porter
,
and
expected
to
remain
one
*NL*
while
he
lived
;
but
meantime
,
in
the
realm
of
thought
,
his
life
was
a
*NL*
perpetual
adventure
.
There
was
so
much
to
know
--
so
many
wonders
to
*NL*
be
discovered
!
Never
in
all
his
life
did
Jurgis
forget
the
day
before
*NL*
election
,
when
there
came
a
telephone
message
from
a
friend
of
Harry
*NL*
Adams
,
asking
him
to
bring
Jurgis
to
see
him
that
night
;
and
Jurgis
*NL*
went
,
and
met
one
of
the
minds
of
the
movement
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
invitation
was
from
a
man
named
Fisher
,
a
Chicago
millionaire
who
*NL*
had
given
up
his
life
to
settlement
work
,
and
had
a
little
home
in
the
*NL*
heart
of
the
city
's
slums
.
He
did
not
belong
to
the
party
,
but
he
was
*NL*
in
sympathy
with
it
;
and
he
said
that
he
was
to
have
as
his
guest
that
*NL*
night
the
editor
of
a
big
Eastern
magazine
,
who
wrote
against
Socialism
,
*NL*
but
really
did
not
know
what
it
was
.
The
millionaire
suggested
that
*NL*
Adams
bring
Jurgis
along
,
and
then
start
up
the
subject
of
``
pure
food
,
''
*NL*
in
which
the
editor
was
interested
.
*NL*
*NL*
Young
Fisher
's
home
was
a
little
two-story
brick
house
,
dingy
and
*NL*
weather-beaten
outside
,
but
attractive
within
.
The
room
that
Jurgis
saw
*NL*
was
half
lined
with
books
,
and
upon
the
walls
were
many
pictures
,
dimly
*NL*
visible
in
the
soft
,
yellow
light
;
it
was
a
cold
,
rainy
night
,
so
a
*NL*
log
fire
was
crackling
in
the
open
hearth
.
Seven
or
eight
people
were
*NL*
gathered
about
it
when
Adams
and
his
friend
arrived
,
and
Jurgis
saw
to
*NL*
his
dismay
that
three
of
them
were
ladies
.
He
had
never
talked
to
people
*NL*
of
this
sort
before
,
and
he
fell
into
an
agony
of
embarrassment
.
He
*NL*
stood
in
the
doorway
clutching
his
hat
tightly
in
his
hands
,
and
made
a
*NL*
deep
bow
to
each
of
the
persons
as
he
was
introduced
;
then
,
when
he
was
*NL*
asked
to
have
a
seat
,
he
took
a
chair
in
a
dark
corner
,
and
sat
down
*NL*
upon
the
edge
of
it
,
and
wiped
the
perspiration
off
his
forehead
with
*NL*
his
sleeve
.
He
was
terrified
lest
they
should
expect
him
to
talk
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
the
host
himself
,
a
tall
,
athletic
young
man
,
clad
in
evening
*NL*
dress
,
as
also
was
the
editor
,
a
dyspeptic-looking
gentleman
named
*NL*
Maynard
.
There
was
the
former
's
frail
young
wife
,
and
also
an
elderly
*NL*
lady
,
who
taught
kindergarten
in
the
settlement
,
and
a
young
college
*NL*
student
,
a
beautiful
girl
with
an
intense
and
earnest
face
.
She
only
*NL*
spoke
once
or
twice
while
Jurgis
was
there
--
the
rest
of
the
time
she
sat
*NL*
by
the
table
in
the
center
of
the
room
,
resting
her
chin
in
her
hands
*NL*
and
drinking
in
the
conversation
.
There
were
two
other
men
,
whom
young
*NL*
Fisher
had
introduced
to
Jurgis
as
Mr.
Lucas
and
Mr.
Schliemann
;
he
*NL*
heard
them
address
Adams
as
``
Comrade
,
''
and
so
he
knew
that
they
were
*NL*
Socialists
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
one
called
Lucas
was
a
mild
and
meek-looking
little
gentleman
of
*NL*
clerical
aspect
;
he
had
been
an
itinerant
evangelist
,
it
transpired
,
*NL*
and
had
seen
the
light
and
become
a
prophet
of
the
new
dispensation
.
*NL*
He
traveled
all
over
the
country
,
living
like
the
apostles
of
old
,
upon
*NL*
hospitality
,
and
preaching
upon
street-corners
when
there
was
no
hall
.
*NL*
The
other
man
had
been
in
the
midst
of
a
discussion
with
the
editor
when
*NL*
Adams
and
Jurgis
came
in
;
and
at
the
suggestion
of
the
host
they
resumed
*NL*
it
after
the
interruption
.
Jurgis
was
soon
sitting
spellbound
,
thinking
*NL*
that
here
was
surely
the
strangest
man
that
had
ever
lived
in
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
Schliemann
was
a
Swede
,
a
tall
,
gaunt
person
,
with
hairy
hands
*NL*
and
bristling
yellow
beard
;
he
was
a
university
man
,
and
had
been
a
*NL*
professor
of
philosophy
--
until
,
as
he
said
,
he
had
found
that
he
was
*NL*
selling
his
character
as
well
as
his
time
.
Instead
he
had
come
to
*NL*
America
,
where
he
lived
in
a
garret
room
in
this
slum
district
,
and
made
*NL*
volcanic
energy
take
the
place
of
fire
.
He
studied
the
composition
of
*NL*
food-stuffs
,
and
knew
exactly
how
many
proteids
and
carbohydrates
his
*NL*
body
needed
;
and
by
scientific
chewing
he
said
that
he
tripled
the
value
*NL*
of
all
he
ate
,
so
that
it
cost
him
eleven
cents
a
day
.
About
the
first
*NL*
of
July
he
would
leave
Chicago
for
his
vacation
,
on
foot
;
and
when
he
*NL*
struck
the
harvest
fields
he
would
set
to
work
for
two
dollars
and
a
*NL*
half
a
day
,
and
come
home
when
he
had
another
year
's
supply
--
a
hundred
*NL*
and
twenty-five
dollars
.
That
was
the
nearest
approach
to
independence
*NL*
a
man
could
make
``
under
capitalism
,
''
he
explained
;
he
would
never
marry
,
*NL*
for
no
sane
man
would
allow
himself
to
fall
in
love
until
after
the
*NL*
revolution
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
in
a
big
arm-chair
,
with
his
legs
crossed
,
and
his
head
so
far
in
*NL*
the
shadow
that
one
saw
only
two
glowing
lights
,
reflected
from
the
fire
*NL*
on
the
hearth
.
He
spoke
simply
,
and
utterly
without
emotion
;
with
the
*NL*
manner
of
a
teacher
setting
forth
to
a
group
of
scholars
an
axiom
in
*NL*
geometry
,
he
would
enunciate
such
propositions
as
made
the
hair
of
*NL*
an
ordinary
person
rise
on
end
.
And
when
the
auditor
had
asserted
*NL*
his
non-comprehension
,
he
would
proceed
to
elucidate
by
some
new
*NL*
proposition
,
yet
more
appalling
.
To
Jurgis
the
Herr
Dr.
Schliemann
*NL*
assumed
the
proportions
of
a
thunderstorm
or
an
earthquake
.
And
yet
,
*NL*
strange
as
it
might
seem
,
there
was
a
subtle
bond
between
them
,
and
he
*NL*
could
follow
the
argument
nearly
all
the
time
.
He
was
carried
over
the
*NL*
difficult
places
in
spite
of
himself
;
and
he
went
plunging
away
in
mad
*NL*
career
--
a
very
Mazeppa-ride
upon
the
wild
horse
Speculation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
Schliemann
was
familiar
with
all
the
universe
,
and
with
man
*NL*
as
a
small
part
of
it
.
He
understood
human
institutions
,
and
blew
them
*NL*
about
like
soap
bubbles
.
It
was
surprising
that
so
much
destructiveness
*NL*
could
be
contained
in
one
human
mind
.
Was
it
government
?
The
purpose
*NL*
of
government
was
the
guarding
of
property-rights
,
the
perpetuation
*NL*
of
ancient
force
and
modern
fraud
.
Or
was
it
marriage
?
Marriage
*NL*
and
prostitution
were
two
sides
of
one
shield
,
the
predatory
man
's
*NL*
exploitation
of
the
sex-pleasure
.
The
difference
between
them
was
a
*NL*
difference
of
class
.
If
a
woman
had
money
she
might
dictate
her
own
*NL*
terms
:
equality
,
a
life
contract
,
and
the
legitimacy
--
that
is
,
the
*NL*
property-rights
--
of
her
children
.
If
she
had
no
money
,
she
was
a
*NL*
proletarian
,
and
sold
herself
for
an
existence
.
And
then
the
subject
*NL*
became
Religion
,
which
was
the
Archfiend
's
deadliest
weapon
.
Government
*NL*
oppressed
the
body
of
the
wage-slave
,
but
Religion
oppressed
his
mind
,
*NL*
and
poisoned
the
stream
of
progress
at
its
source
.
The
working-man
was
*NL*
to
fix
his
hopes
upon
a
future
life
,
while
his
pockets
were
picked
in
*NL*
this
one
;
he
was
brought
up
to
frugality
,
humility
,
obedience
--
in
short
*NL*
to
all
the
pseudo-virtues
of
capitalism
.
The
destiny
of
civilization
*NL*
would
be
decided
in
one
final
death
struggle
between
the
Red
*NL*
International
and
the
Black
,
between
Socialism
and
the
Roman
Catholic
*NL*
Church
;
while
here
at
home
,
``
the
stygian
midnight
of
American
*NL*
evangelicalism
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
here
the
ex-preacher
entered
the
field
,
and
there
was
a
lively
*NL*
tussle
.
``
Comrade
''
Lucas
was
not
what
is
called
an
educated
man
;
he
knew
*NL*
only
the
Bible
,
but
it
was
the
Bible
interpreted
by
real
experience
.
And
*NL*
what
was
the
use
,
he
asked
,
of
confusing
Religion
with
men
's
perversions
*NL*
of
it
?
That
the
church
was
in
the
hands
of
the
merchants
at
the
moment
*NL*
was
obvious
enough
;
but
already
there
were
signs
of
rebellion
,
and
if
*NL*
Comrade
Schliemann
could
come
back
a
few
years
from
now
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
yes
,
''
said
the
other
,
``
of
course
,
I
have
no
doubt
that
in
a
hundred
*NL*
years
the
Vatican
will
be
denying
that
it
ever
opposed
Socialism
,
just
*NL*
as
at
present
it
denies
that
it
ever
tortured
Galileo
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
defending
the
Vatican
,
''
exclaimed
Lucas
,
vehemently
.
``
I
am
*NL*
defending
the
word
of
God
--
which
is
one
long
cry
of
the
human
spirit
for
*NL*
deliverance
from
the
sway
of
oppression
.
Take
the
twenty-fourth
chapter
*NL*
of
the
Book
of
Job
,
which
I
am
accustomed
to
quote
in
my
addresses
as
*NL*
`
the
Bible
upon
the
Beef
Trust
'
;
or
take
the
words
of
Isaiah
--
or
of
the
*NL*
Master
himself
!
Not
the
elegant
prince
of
our
debauched
and
vicious
art
,
*NL*
not
the
jeweled
idol
of
our
society
churches
--
but
the
Jesus
of
the
awful
*NL*
reality
,
the
man
of
sorrow
and
pain
,
the
outcast
,
despised
of
the
world
,
*NL*
who
had
nowhere
to
lay
his
head
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
grant
you
Jesus
,
''
interrupted
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
''
cried
Lucas
,
``
and
why
should
Jesus
have
nothing
to
do
with
*NL*
his
church
--
why
should
his
words
and
his
life
be
of
no
authority
among
*NL*
those
who
profess
to
adore
him
?
Here
is
a
man
who
was
the
world
's
first
*NL*
revolutionist
,
the
true
founder
of
the
Socialist
movement
;
a
man
whose
*NL*
whole
being
was
one
flame
of
hatred
for
wealth
,
and
all
that
wealth
*NL*
stands
for
,
--
for
the
pride
of
wealth
,
and
the
luxury
of
wealth
,
and
the
*NL*
tyranny
of
wealth
;
who
was
himself
a
beggar
and
a
tramp
,
a
man
of
the
*NL*
people
,
an
associate
of
saloon-keepers
and
women
of
the
town
;
who
again
*NL*
and
again
,
in
the
most
explicit
language
,
denounced
wealth
and
*NL*
the
holding
of
wealth
:
`
Lay
not
up

Verily

I
say
unto
you
,
that

hardly

Who
drove
out

business
men

from
the
temple
with

Who
was
crucified

think
of
it
--
for
an
incendiary
and
a
disturber
*NL*
of
the
social
order

And
this
man
they
have
made
into
the
high
priest
of

property
and
smug
respectability
,
a
divine
sanction
of
all
the
horrors

Jeweled

made

industry
bring

wrung
from
the
toil
of
helpless
women

and
children
,
and
build
temples
to
him

listen

expounded
by
doctors
of
dusty
divinity

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bravo
!
''
cried
Schliemann
,
laughing
.
But
the
other
was
in
full
*NL*
career
--
he
had
talked
this
subject
every
day
for
five
years
,
and
had
*NL*
never
yet
let
himself
be
stopped
.
``
This
Jesus
of
Nazareth

he
cried
.
*NL*
``
This
class-conscious
working-man

He

grinds
the
bodies

souls
of
human

this

see
the

mad

dreadful
night
when

lay
in

writhed
*NL*
in
agony

he
sweat
blood

you
think
that

saw
anything
worse

than
he
might
see
tonight
upon
the
plains

men
march

out
with
a
jeweled
image
of
him
before
them
,
to
do
wholesale
murder
for
*NL*
the
benefit
of
foul
monsters
of
sensuality
and
cruelty
?
Do
you
not
know
*NL*
that
if
he
were
in
St.
Petersburg
now
,
he
would
take
the
whip
with
which
*NL*
he
drove
out
the
bankers
from
his
temple

''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
speaker
paused
an
instant
for
breath
.
``
No
,
comrade
,
''
said
the
*NL*
other
,
dryly
,
``
for
he
was
a
practical
man

little

such
as

shipped

handy
for

and
strong
enough
to
blow
a
whole
temple
out

sight

''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucas
waited
until
the
company
had
stopped
laughing
over
this
;
then
*NL*
he
began
again
:
``
But
look
at
it
from
the
point
of
view

Here
is
an
historical
figure
whom
all
men
reverence
*NL*
and
love
,
whom
some
regard
as
divine
;
and
who
was
one
of
us
--
who
lived
*NL*
our
life
,
and
taught
our
doctrine
.
And
now
shall
we
leave
him
in
the
*NL*
hands
of
his
enemies
--
shall
we
allow
them
to
stifle
and
stultify
his
*NL*
example
?
We
have
his
words
,
which
no
one
can
deny
;
and
shall
we
not
*NL*
quote
them

the
people
,

prove

them

No

no

shall
yet
rouse

''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucas
halted
again
;
and
the
other
stretched
out
his
hand
to
a
paper
on
*NL*
the
table
.
``
Here
,
comrade
,
''
he
said
,
with
a
laugh
,
``
here
is
a
place
for
*NL*
you
to
begin
.
A
bishop
whose
wife
has
just
been
robbed
of
fifty
thousand
*NL*
dollars
'
worth
of
diamonds
!
And
a
most
unctuous
and
oily
of
bishops
!
*NL*
An
eminent
and
scholarly
bishop
!
A
philanthropist
and
friend
of
labor
*NL*
bishop
--
a
Civic
Federation
decoy
duck
for
the
chloroforming
of
the
*NL*
wage-working-man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
little
passage
of
arms
the
rest
of
the
company
sat
as
*NL*
spectators
.
But
now
Mr.
Maynard
,
the
editor
,
took
occasion
to
remark
,
*NL*
somewhat
naively
,
that
he
had
always
understood
that
Socialists
had
a
*NL*
cut-and-dried
program
for
the
future
of
civilization
;
whereas
here
were
*NL*
two
active
members
of
the
party
,
who
,
from
what
he
could
make
out
,
were
*NL*
agreed
about
nothing
at
all
.
Would
the
two
,
for
his
enlightenment
,
try
*NL*
to
ascertain
just
what
they
had
in
common
,
and
why
they
belonged
to
the
*NL*
same
party
?
This
resulted
,
after
much
debating
,
in
the
formulating
of
*NL*
two
carefully
worded
propositions
:
First
,
that
a
Socialist
believes
in
*NL*
the
common
ownership
and
democratic
management
of
the
means
of
producing
*NL*
the
necessities
of
life
;
and
,
second
,
that
a
Socialist
believes
that
*NL*
the
means
by
which
this
is
to
be
brought
about
is
the
class
conscious
*NL*
political
organization
of
the
wage-earners
.
Thus
far
they
were
at
*NL*
one
;
but
no
farther
.
To
Lucas
,
the
religious
zealot
,
the
co-operative
*NL*
commonwealth
was
the
New
Jerusalem
,
the
kingdom
of
Heaven
,
which
is
*NL*
``
within
you
.
''
To
the
other
,
Socialism
was
simply
a
necessary
step
toward
*NL*
a
far-distant
goal
,
a
step
to
be
tolerated
with
impatience
.
Schliemann
*NL*
called
himself
a
``
philosophic
anarchist
''
;
and
he
explained
that
an
*NL*
anarchist
was
one
who
believed
that
the
end
of
human
existence
was
the
*NL*
free
development
of
every
personality
,
unrestricted
by
laws
save
those
*NL*
of
its
own
being
.
Since
the
same
kind
of
match
would
light
every
one
's
*NL*
fire
and
the
same-shaped
loaf
of
bread
would
fill
every
one
's
stomach
,
*NL*
it
would
be
perfectly
feasible
to
submit
industry
to
the
control
of
a
*NL*
majority
vote
.
There
was
only
one
earth
,
and
the
quantity
of
material
*NL*
things
was
limited
.
Of
intellectual
and
moral
things
,
on
the
other
hand
,
*NL*
there
was
no
limit
,
and
one
could
have
more
without
another
's
*NL*
having
less
;
hence
``
Communism
in
material
production
,
anarchism
in
*NL*
intellectual
,
''
was
the
formula
of
modern
proletarian
thought
.
As
soon
*NL*
as
the
birth
agony
was
over
,
and
the
wounds
of
society
had
been
healed
,
*NL*
there
would
be
established
a
simple
system
whereby
each
man
was
credited
*NL*
with
his
labor
and
debited
with
his
purchases
;
and
after
that
the
*NL*
processes
of
production
,
exchange
,
and
consumption
would
go
on
*NL*
automatically
,
and
without
our
being
conscious
of
them
,
any
more
than
*NL*
a
man
is
conscious
of
the
beating
of
his
heart
.
And
then
,
explained
*NL*
Schliemann
,
society
would
break
up
into
independent
,
self-governing
*NL*
communities
of
mutually
congenial
persons
;
examples
of
which
at
present
*NL*
were
clubs
,
churches
,
and
political
parties
.
After
the
revolution
,
all
*NL*
the
intellectual
,
artistic
,
and
spiritual
activities
of
men
would
be
*NL*
cared
for
by
such
``
free
associations
''
;
romantic
novelists
would
be
*NL*
supported
by
those
who
liked
to
read
romantic
novels
,
and
impressionist
*NL*
painters
would
be
supported
by
those
who
liked
to
look
at
impressionist
*NL*
pictures
--
and
the
same
with
preachers
and
scientists
,
editors
and
actors
*NL*
and
musicians
.
If
any
one
wanted
to
work
or
paint
or
pray
,
and
could
*NL*
find
no
one
to
maintain
him
,
he
could
support
himself
by
working
part
of
*NL*
the
time
.
That
was
the
case
at
present
,
the
only
difference
being
that
*NL*
the
competitive
wage
system
compelled
a
man
to
work
all
the
time
to
*NL*
live
,
while
,
after
the
abolition
of
privilege
and
exploitation
,
any
*NL*
one
would
be
able
to
support
himself
by
an
hour
's
work
a
day
.
Also
the
*NL*
artist
's
audience
of
the
present
was
a
small
minority
of
people
,
all
*NL*
debased
and
vulgarized
by
the
effort
it
had
cost
them
to
win
in
the
*NL*
commercial
battle
,
of
the
intellectual
and
artistic
activities
which
*NL*
would
result
when
the
whole
of
mankind
was
set
free
from
the
nightmare
*NL*
of
competition
,
we
could
at
present
form
no
conception
whatever
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
the
editor
wanted
to
know
upon
what
ground
Dr.
Schliemann
*NL*
asserted
that
it
might
be
possible
for
a
society
to
exist
upon
an
hour
's
*NL*
toil
by
each
of
its
members
.
``
Just
what
,
''
answered
the
other
,
``
would
be
*NL*
the
productive
capacity
of
society
if
the
present
resources
of
science
*NL*
were
utilized
,
we
have
no
means
of
ascertaining
;
but
we
may
be
sure
it
*NL*
would
exceed
anything
that
would
sound
reasonable
to
minds
inured
to
*NL*
the
ferocious
barbarities
of
capitalism
.
After
the
triumph
of
the
*NL*
international
proletariat
,
war
would
of
course
be
inconceivable
;
and
*NL*
who
can
figure
the
cost
of
war
to
humanity
--
not
merely
the
value
of
the
*NL*
lives
and
the
material
that
it
destroys
,
not
merely
the
cost
of
keeping
*NL*
millions
of
men
in
idleness
,
of
arming
and
equipping
them
for
battle
*NL*
and
parade
,
but
the
drain
upon
the
vital
energies
of
society
by
the
*NL*
war
attitude
and
the
war
terror
,
the
brutality
and
ignorance
,
the
*NL*
drunkenness
,
prostitution
,
and
crime
it
entails
,
the
industrial
*NL*
impotence
and
the
moral
deadness
?
Do
you
think
that
it
would
be
too
much
*NL*
to
say
that
two
hours
of
the
working
time
of
every
efficient
member
of
a
*NL*
community
goes
to
feed
the
red
fiend
of
war
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
Schliemann
went
on
to
outline
some
of
the
wastes
of
*NL*
competition
:
the
losses
of
industrial
warfare
;
the
ceaseless
worry
and
*NL*
friction
;
the
vices
--
such
as
drink
,
for
instance
,
the
use
of
which
had
*NL*
nearly
doubled
in
twenty
years
,
as
a
consequence
of
the
intensification
*NL*
of
the
economic
struggle
;
the
idle
and
unproductive
members
of
the
*NL*
community
,
the
frivolous
rich
and
the
pauperized
poor
;
the
law
and
the
*NL*
whole
machinery
of
repression
;
the
wastes
of
social
ostentation
,
the
*NL*
milliners
and
tailors
,
the
hairdressers
,
dancing
masters
,
chefs
and
*NL*
lackeys
.
``
You
understand
,
''
he
said
,
``
that
in
a
society
dominated
by
*NL*
the
fact
of
commercial
competition
,
money
is
necessarily
the
test
of
*NL*
prowess
,
and
wastefulness
the
sole
criterion
of
power
.
So
we
have
,
*NL*
at
the
present
moment
,
a
society
with
,
say
,
thirty
per
cent
of
the
*NL*
population
occupied
in
producing
useless
articles
,
and
one
per
cent
*NL*
occupied
in
destroying
them
.
And
this
is
not
all
;
for
the
servants
*NL*
and
panders
of
the
parasites
are
also
parasites
,
the
milliners
and
the
*NL*
jewelers
and
the
lackeys
have
also
to
be
supported
by
the
useful
members
*NL*
of
the
community
.
And
bear
in
mind
also
that
this
monstrous
disease
*NL*
affects
not
merely
the
idlers
and
their
menials
,
its
poison
penetrates
*NL*
the
whole
social
body
.
Beneath
the
hundred
thousand
women
of
the
elite
*NL*
are
a
million
middle-class
women
,
miserable
because
they
are
not
of
the
*NL*
elite
,
and
trying
to
appear
of
it
in
public
;
and
beneath
them
,
in
turn
,
*NL*
are
five
million
farmers
'
wives
reading
`
fashion
papers
'
and
trimming
*NL*
bonnets
,
and
shop-girls
and
serving-maids
selling
themselves
into
*NL*
brothels
for
cheap
jewelry
and
imitation
seal-skin
robes
.
And
then
*NL*
consider
that
,
added
to
this
competition
in
display
,
you
have
,
like
*NL*
oil
on
the
flames
,
a
whole
system
of
competition
in
selling
!
You
have
*NL*
manufacturers
contriving
tens
of
thousands
of
catchpenny
devices
,
*NL*
storekeepers
displaying
them
,
and
newspapers
and
magazines
filled
up
*NL*
with
advertisements
of
them
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
n't
forget
the
wastes
of
fraud
,
''
put
in
young
Fisher
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
one
comes
to
the
ultra-modern
profession
of
advertising
,
''
*NL*
responded
Schliemann
--
``
the
science
of
persuading
people
to
buy
what
they
*NL*
do
not
want

he
is
in
the
very
center

the
ghastly
charnel
house
*NL*
of
capitalist
destructiveness
,
and
he
scarcely
knows
which
of
a
dozen
*NL*
horrors
to
point
out
first
.
But
consider
the
waste
in
time
and
energy
*NL*
incidental
to
making
ten
thousand
varieties
of
a
thing
for
purposes

one

would
do
for

all
the
waste
incidental
to
the
manufacture
of
cheap
qualities
*NL*
of
goods
,
of
goods
made
to

and
deceive

ignorant

wastes
of
adulteration
,
--
the
shoddy

cotton

unstable

the

put
in
the
ex-preacher

*NL*
*NL*
``
Precisely
,
''
said
Schliemann
;
``
the
low
knavery

the

Of
course
,
imitation

the
essence

competition

they
are
but
another
form
of
the
phrase
`

buy
in
the
*NL*
cheapest
market

sell
in
the
dearest

'
A
government
official
has
*NL*
stated
that
the
nation
suffers
a
loss
of
a
billion
and
a
quarter
dollars
*NL*
a
year
through
adulterated
foods
;
which
means
,
of
course
,
not

might
have
been
useful
outside

been
well

and
undertakers
for
the
whole
human
race
ten

twenty
years
*NL*
before
the
proper
time

Then
again
,
consider
the
waste
of
time
and
*NL*
energy
required
to
sell
these
things
in
a
dozen
stores
,
where
one
would
*NL*
do
.
There
are
a
million
or
two
of
business
firms
in
the
country
,
*NL*
and
five

ten
times
as
many

consider
the
handling

rehandling
,
the
accounting
and
reaccounting
,
the
planning
and
worrying
,
*NL*
the
balancing
of
petty
profit
and

.
Consider
the
whole
machinery
*NL*
of
the
civil
law
made
necessary
by
these
processes
;
the
libraries
of

ponderous

studying
to

pettifogging

!
Consider
the
wastes
incidental
to
the
blind

*NL*
production
of
commodities
--
the
factories
closed
,
the
workers
idle
,

so
the

five

the

a

international

more

such
thinkers

selects

I
wish
such
things
to
be
left

at

together

what

the

then
listen
to
him
;
I
,
who
do
not

stay
away

it

nothing

live
*NL*
separately
,
the
domestic
drudge
being
either
the
wife
or
a
wage
slave
.
*NL*
Now
set
aside
the
modern
system
of
pneumatic
house-cleaning
,
and
the
*NL*
economies
of
co-operative
cooking
;
and
consider
one
single
item
,
the
*NL*
washing
of
dishes
.
Surely
it
is
moderate
to
say
that
the
dish-washing
*NL*
for
a
family
of
five
takes
half
an
hour
a
day
;
with
ten
hours
as
a
day
's
*NL*
work
,
it
takes
,
therefore
,
half
a
million
able-bodied
persons
--
mostly
*NL*
women
to
do
the
dish-washing
of
the
country
.
And
note
that
this
is
most
*NL*
filthy
and
deadening
and
brutalizing
work
;
that
it
is
a
cause
of
anemia
,
*NL*
nervousness
,
ugliness
,
and
ill-temper
;
of
prostitution
,
suicide
,
and
*NL*
insanity
;
of
drunken
husbands
and
degenerate
children
--
for
all
of
which
*NL*
things
the
community
has
naturally
to
pay
.
And
now
consider
that
in
each
*NL*
of
my
little
free
communities
there
would
be
a
machine
which
would
wash
*NL*
and
dry
the
dishes
,
and
do
it
,
not
merely
to
the
eye
and
the
touch
,
*NL*
but
scientifically
--
sterilizing
them
--
and
do
it
at
a
saving
of
all
the
*NL*
drudgery
and
nine-tenths
of
the
time
!
All
of
these
things
you
may
*NL*
find
in
the
books
of
Mrs.
Gilman
;
and
then
take
Kropotkin
's
Fields
,
*NL*
Factories
,
and
Workshops
,
and
read
about
the
new
science
of
agriculture
,
*NL*
which
has
been
built
up
in
the
last
ten
years
;
by
which
,
with
made
soils
*NL*
and
intensive
culture
,
a
gardener
can
raise
ten
or
twelve
crops
in
a
*NL*
season
,
and
two
hundred
tons
of
vegetables
upon
a
single
acre
;
by
which
*NL*
the
population
of
the
whole
globe
could
be
supported
on
the
soil
now
*NL*
cultivated
in
the
United
States
alone
!
It
is
impossible
to
apply
such
*NL*
methods
now
,
owing
to
the
ignorance
and
poverty
of
our
scattered
farming
*NL*
population
;
but
imagine
the
problem
of
providing
the
food
supply
of
our
*NL*
nation
once
taken
in
hand
systematically
and
rationally
,
by
scientists
!
*NL*
All
the
poor
and
rocky
land
set
apart
for
a
national
timber
reserve
,
in
*NL*
which
our
children
play
,
and
our
young
men
hunt
,
and
our
poets
dwell
!
*NL*
The
most
favorable
climate
and
soil
for
each
product
selected
;
the
*NL*
exact
requirements
of
the
community
known
,
and
the
acreage
figured
*NL*
accordingly
;
the
most
improved
machinery
employed
,
under
the
direction
*NL*
of
expert
agricultural
chemists
!
I
was
brought
up
on
a
farm
,
and
I
know
*NL*
the
awful
deadliness
of
farm
work
;
and
I
like
to
picture
it
all
as
*NL*
it
will
be
after
the
revolution
.
To
picture
the
great
potato-planting
*NL*
machine
,
drawn
by
four
horses
,
or
an
electric
motor
,
ploughing
the
*NL*
furrow
,
cutting
and
dropping
and
covering
the
potatoes
,
and
planting
a
*NL*
score
of
acres
a
day
!
To
picture
the
great
potato-digging
machine
,
*NL*
run
by
electricity
,
perhaps
,
and
moving
across
a
thousand-acre
field
,
*NL*
scooping
up
earth
and
potatoes
,
and
dropping
the
latter
into
sacks
!
To
*NL*
every
other
kind
of
vegetable
and
fruit
handled
in
the
same
way
--
apples
*NL*
and
oranges
picked
by
machinery
,
cows
milked
by
electricity
--
things
*NL*
which
are
already
done
,
as
you
may
know
.
To
picture
the
harvest
fields
*NL*
of
the
future
,
to
which
millions
of
happy
men
and
women
come
for
a
*NL*
summer
holiday
,
brought
by
special
trains
,
the
exactly
needful
number
to
*NL*
each
place
!
And
to
contrast
all
this
with
our
present
agonizing
system
*NL*
of
independent
small
farming
,
--
a
stunted
,
haggard
,
ignorant
man
,
mated
*NL*
with
a
yellow
,
lean
,
and
sad-eyed
drudge
,
and
toiling
from
four
o'clock
*NL*
in
the
morning
until
nine
at
night
,
working
the
children
as
soon
as
they
*NL*
are
able
to
walk
,
scratching
the
soil
with
its
primitive
tools
,
and
shut
*NL*
out
from
all
knowledge
and
hope
,
from
all
their
benefits
of
science
and
*NL*
invention
,
and
all
the
joys
of
the
spirit
--
held
to
a
bare
existence
*NL*
by
competition
in
labor
,
and
boasting
of
his
freedom
because
he
is
too
*NL*
blind
to
see
his
chains
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Schliemann
paused
a
moment
.
``
And
then
,
''
he
continued
,
``
place
*NL*
beside
this
fact
of
an
unlimited
food
supply
,
the
newest
discovery
of
*NL*
physiologists
,
that
most
of
the
ills
of
the
human
system
are
due
to
*NL*
overfeeding
!
And
then
again
,
it
has
been
proven
that
meat
is
unnecessary
*NL*
as
a
food
;
and
meat
is
obviously
more
difficult
to
produce
than
*NL*
vegetable
food
,
less
pleasant
to
prepare
and
handle
,
and
more
likely
*NL*
to
be
unclean
.
But
what
of
that
,
so
long
as
it
tickles
the
palate
more
*NL*
strongly
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
would
Socialism
change
that
?
''
asked
the
girl-student
,
quickly
.
It
*NL*
was
the
first
time
she
had
spoken
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
long
as
we
have
wage
slavery
,
''
answered
Schliemann
,
``
it
matters
not
*NL*
in
the
least
how
debasing
and
repulsive
a
task
may
be
,
it
is
easy
to
*NL*
find
people
to
perform
it
.
But
just
as
soon
as
labor
is
set
free
,
then
*NL*
the
price
of
such
work
will
begin
to
rise
.
So
one
by
one
the
old
,
dingy
,
*NL*
and
unsanitary
factories
will
come
down
--
it
will
be
cheaper
to
build
*NL*
new
;
and
so
the
steamships
will
be
provided
with
stoking
machinery
,
and
*NL*
so
the
dangerous
trades
will
be
made
safe
,
or
substitutes
will
be
found
*NL*
for
their
products
.
In
exactly
the
same
way
,
as
the
citizens
of
*NL*
our
Industrial
Republic
become
refined
,
year
by
year
the
cost
of
*NL*
slaughterhouse
products
will
increase
;
until
eventually
those
who
want
*NL*
to
eat
meat
will
have
to
do
their
own
killing
--
and
how
long
do
you
think
*NL*
the
custom
would
survive
then
?
--
To
go
on
to
another
item
--
one
of
the
*NL*
necessary
accompaniments
of
capitalism
in
a
democracy
is
political
*NL*
corruption
;
and
one
of
the
consequences
of
civic
administration
by
*NL*
ignorant
and
vicious
politicians
,
is
that
preventable
diseases
kill
off
*NL*
half
our
population
.
And
even
if
science
were
allowed
to
try
,
it
could
*NL*
do
little
,
because
the
majority
of
human
beings
are
not
yet
human
beings
*NL*
at
all
,
but
simply
machines
for
the
creating
of
wealth
for
others
.
They
*NL*
are
penned
up
in
filthy
houses
and
left
to
rot
and
stew
in
misery
,
and
*NL*
the
conditions
of
their
life
make
them
ill
faster
than
all
the
doctors
*NL*
in
the
world
could
heal
them
;
and
so
,
of
course
,
they
remain
as
centers
*NL*
of
contagion
,
poisoning
the
lives
of
all
of
us
,
and
making
happiness
*NL*
impossible
for
even
the
most
selfish
.
For
this
reason
I
would
seriously
*NL*
maintain
that
all
the
medical
and
surgical
discoveries
that
science
can
*NL*
make
in
the
future
will
be
of
less
importance
than
the
application
of
*NL*
the
knowledge
we
already
possess
,
when
the
disinherited
of
the
earth
*NL*
have
established
their
right
to
a
human
existence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
here
the
Herr
Doctor
relapsed
into
silence
again
.
Jurgis
had
noticed
*NL*
that
the
beautiful
young
girl
who
sat
by
the
center-table
was
listening
*NL*
with
something
of
the
same
look
that
he
himself
had
worn
,
the
time
when
*NL*
he
had
first
discovered
Socialism
.
Jurgis
would
have
liked
to
talk
to
*NL*
her
,
he
felt
sure
that
she
would
have
understood
him
.
Later
on
in
the
*NL*
evening
,
when
the
group
broke
up
,
he
heard
Mrs.
Fisher
say
to
her
,
in
*NL*
a
low
voice
,
``
I
wonder
if
Mr.
Maynard
will
still
write
the
same
things
*NL*
about
Socialism
''
;
to
which
she
answered
,
``
I
do
n't
know
--
but
if
he
does
*NL*
we
shall
know
that
he
is
a
knave
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
And
only
a
few
hours
after
this
came
election
day
--
when
the
long
*NL*
campaign
was
over
,
and
the
whole
country
seemed
to
stand
still
and
hold
*NL*
its
breath
,
awaiting
the
issue
.
Jurgis
and
the
rest
of
the
staff
of
*NL*
Hinds
's
Hotel
could
hardly
stop
to
finish
their
dinner
,
before
they
*NL*
hurried
off
to
the
big
hall
which
the
party
had
hired
for
that
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
already
there
were
people
waiting
,
and
already
the
telegraph
*NL*
instrument
on
the
stage
had
begun
clicking
off
the
returns
.
When
the
*NL*
final
accounts
were
made
up
,
the
Socialist
vote
proved
to
be
over
four
*NL*
hundred
thousand
--
an
increase
of
something
like
three
hundred
and
fifty
*NL*
per
cent
in
four
years
.
And
that
was
doing
well
;
but
the
party
was
*NL*
dependent
for
its
early
returns
upon
messages
from
the
locals
,
and
*NL*
naturally
those
locals
which
had
been
most
successful
were
the
ones
*NL*
which
felt
most
like
reporting
;
and
so
that
night
every
one
in
the
hall
*NL*
believed
that
the
vote
was
going
to
be
six
,
or
seven
,
or
even
eight
*NL*
hundred
thousand
.
Just
such
an
incredible
increase
had
actually
been
*NL*
made
in
Chicago
,
and
in
the
state
;
the
vote
of
the
city
had
been
6,700
*NL*
in
1900
,
and
now
it
was
47,000
;
that
of
Illinois
had
been
9,600
,
and
*NL*
now
it
was
69,000
!
So
,
as
the
evening
waxed
,
and
the
crowd
piled
in
,
the
*NL*
meeting
was
a
sight
to
be
seen
.
Bulletins
would
be
read
,
and
the
people
*NL*
would
shout
themselves
hoarse
--
and
then
some
one
would
make
a
speech
,
*NL*
and
there
would
be
more
shouting
;
and
then
a
brief
silence
,
and
more
*NL*
bulletins
.
There
would
come
messages
from
the
secretaries
of
neighboring
*NL*
states
,
reporting
their
achievements
;
the
vote
of
Indiana
had
gone
from
*NL*
2,300
to
12,000
,
of
Wisconsin
from
7,000
to
28,000
;
of
Ohio
from
4,800
*NL*
to
36,000
!
There
were
telegrams
to
the
national
office
from
enthusiastic
*NL*
individuals
in
little
towns
which
had
made
amazing
and
unprecedented
*NL*
increases
in
a
single
year
:
Benedict
,
Kansas
,
from
26
to
260
;
Henderson
,
*NL*
Kentucky
,
from
19
to
111
;
Holland
,
Michigan
,
from
14
to
208
;
Cleo
,
*NL*
Oklahoma
,
from
0
to
104
;
Martin
's
Ferry
,
Ohio
,
from
0
to
296
--
and
many
*NL*
more
of
the
same
kind
.
There
were
literally
hundreds
of
such
towns
;
*NL*
there
would
be
reports
from
half
a
dozen
of
them
in
a
single
batch
of
*NL*
telegrams
.
And
the
men
who
read
the
despatches
off
to
the
audience
were
*NL*
old
campaigners
,
who
had
been
to
the
places
and
helped
to
make
the
*NL*
vote
,
and
could
make
appropriate
comments
:
Quincy
,
Illinois
,
from
189
to
*NL*
831
--
that
was
where
the
mayor
had
arrested
a
Socialist
speaker
!
Crawford
*NL*
County
,
Kansas
,
from
285
to
1,975
;
that
was
the
home
of
the
``
Appeal
*NL*
to
Reason
''
!
Battle
Creek
,
Michigan
,
from
4,261
to
10,184
;
that
was
the
*NL*
answer
of
labor
to
the
Citizens
'
Alliance
Movement
!
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
there
were
official
returns
from
the
various
precincts
and
*NL*
wards
of
the
city
itself
!
Whether
it
was
a
factory
district
or
one
of
*NL*
the
``
silk-stocking
''
wards
seemed
to
make
no
particular
difference
in
the
*NL*
increase
;
but
one
of
the
things
which
surprised
the
party
leaders
*NL*
most
was
the
tremendous
vote
that
came
rolling
in
from
the
stockyards
.
*NL*
Packingtown
comprised
three
wards
of
the
city
,
and
the
vote
in
the
*NL*
spring
of
1903
had
been
500
,
and
in
the
fall
of
the
same
year
,
1,600
.
*NL*
Now
,
only
one
year
later
,
it
was
over
6,300
--
and
the
Democratic
vote
*NL*
only
8,800
!
There
were
other
wards
in
which
the
Democratic
vote
had
*NL*
been
actually
surpassed
,
and
in
two
districts
,
members
of
the
state
*NL*
legislature
had
been
elected
.
Thus
Chicago
now
led
the
country
;
it
had
*NL*
set
a
new
standard
for
the
party
,
it
had
shown
the
workingmen
the
way
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
So
spoke
an
orator
upon
the
platform
;
and
two
thousand
pairs
of
eyes
*NL*
were
fixed
upon
him
,
and
two
thousand
voices
were
cheering
his
every
*NL*
sentence
.
The
orator
had
been
the
head
of
the
city
's
relief
bureau
in
*NL*
the
stockyards
,
until
the
sight
of
misery
and
corruption
had
made
him
*NL*
sick
.
He
was
young
,
hungry-looking
,
full
of
fire
;
and
as
he
swung
his
*NL*
long
arms
and
beat
up
the
crowd
,
to
Jurgis
he
seemed
the
very
spirit
of
*NL*
the
revolution
.
``
Organize
!
Organize
!
Organize
!
''
--
that
was
his
cry
.
He
*NL*
was
afraid
of
this
tremendous
vote
,
which
his
party
had
not
expected
,
*NL*
and
which
it
had
not
earned
.
``
These
men
are
not
Socialists
!
''
he
cried
.
*NL*
``
This
election
will
pass
,
and
the
excitement
will
die
,
and
people
will
*NL*
forget
about
it
;
and
if
you
forget
about
it
,
too
,
if
you
sink
back
and
*NL*
rest
upon
your
oars
,
we
shall
lose
this
vote
that
we
have
polled
to-day
,
*NL*
and
our
enemies
will
laugh
us
to
scorn
!
It
rests
with
you
to
take
your
*NL*
resolution
--
now
,
in
the
flush
of
victory
,
to
find
these
men
who
have
*NL*
voted
for
us
,
and
bring
them
to
our
meetings
,
and
organize
them
and
bind
*NL*
them
to
us
!
We
shall
not
find
all
our
campaigns
as
easy
as
this
one
.
*NL*
Everywhere
in
the
country
tonight
the
old
party
politicians
are
studying
*NL*
this
vote
,
and
setting
their
sails
by
it
;
and
nowhere
will
they
be
*NL*
quicker
or
more
cunning
than
here
in
our
own
city
.
Fifty
thousand
*NL*
Socialist
votes
in
Chicago
means
a
municipal-ownership
Democracy
in
the
*NL*
spring
!
And
then
they
will
fool
the
voters
once
more
,
and
all
the
powers
*NL*
of
plunder
and
corruption
will
be
swept
into
office
again
!
But
whatever
*NL*
they
may
do
when
they
get
in
,
there
is
one
thing
they
will
not
do
,
and
*NL*
that
will
be
the
thing
for
which
they
were
elected
!
They
will
not
give
*NL*
the
people
of
our
city
municipal
ownership
--
they
will
not
mean
to
do
it
,
*NL*
they
will
not
try
to
do
it
;
all
that
they
will
do
is
give
our
party
*NL*
in
Chicago
the
greatest
opportunity
that
has
ever
come
to
Socialism
*NL*
in
America
!
We
shall
have
the
sham
reformers
self-stultified
and
*NL*
self-convicted
;
we
shall
have
the
radical
Democracy
left
without
a
lie
*NL*
with
which
to
cover
its
nakedness
!
And
then
will
begin
the
rush
that
*NL*
will
never
be
checked
,
the
tide
that
will
never
turn
till
it
has
reached
*NL*
its
flood
--
that
will
be
irresistible
,
overwhelming
--
the
rallying
of
the
*NL*
outraged
workingmen
of
Chicago
to
our
standard
!
And
we
shall
organize
*NL*
them
,
we
shall
drill
them
,
we
shall
marshal
them
for
the
victory
!
We
*NL*
shall
bear
down
the
opposition
,
we
shall
sweep
if
before
us
--
and
Chicago
*NL*
will
be
ours
!
Chicago
will
be
ours
!
CHICAGO
WILL
BE
OURS
!
