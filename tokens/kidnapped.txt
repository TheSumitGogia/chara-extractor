PREFACE

BIOGRAPHICAL
EDITION
*NL*
*NL*
While
my
husband
and
Mr.
Henley
were
engaged
in
writing
plays
in
*NL*
Bournemouth
they
made
a
number
of
titles
,
hoping
to
use
them
in
the
*NL*
future
.
Dramatic
composition
was
not
what
my
husband
preferred
,
but
*NL*
the
torrent
of
Mr.
Henley
's
enthusiasm
swept
him
off
his
feet
.
However
,
*NL*
after
several
plays
had
been
finished
,
and
his
health
seriously
impaired
*NL*
by
his
endeavours
to
keep
up
with
Mr.
Henley
,
play
writing
was
abandoned
*NL*
forever
,
and
my
husband
returned
to
his
legitimate
vocation
.
Having
*NL*
added
one
of
the
titles
,
The
Hanging
Judge
,
to
the
list
of
projected
*NL*
plays
,
now
thrown
aside
,
and
emboldened
by
my
husband
's
offer
to
give
me
*NL*
any
help
needed
,
I
concluded
to
try
and
write
it
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
wanted
a
trial
scene
in
the
Old
Bailey
,
I
chose
the
period
of
1700
*NL*
for
my
purpose
;
but
being
shamefully
ignorant
of
my
subject
,
and
my
*NL*
husband
confessing
to
little
more
knowledge
than
I
possessed
,
a
London
*NL*
bookseller
was
commissioned
to
send
us
everything
he
could
procure
*NL*
bearing
on
Old
Bailey
trials
.
A
great
package
came
in
response
to
our
*NL*
order
,
and
very
soon
we
were
both
absorbed
,
not
so
much
in
the
trials
*NL*
as
in
following
the
brilliant
career
of
a
Mr.
Garrow
,
who
appeared
as
*NL*
counsel
in
many
of
the
cases
.
We
sent
for
more
books
,
and
yet
more
,
*NL*
still
intent
on
Mr.
Garrow
,
whose
subtle
cross-examination
of
witnesses
*NL*
and
masterly
,
if
sometimes
startling
,
methods
of
arriving
at
the
truth
*NL*
seemed
more
thrilling
to
us
than
any
novel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Occasionally
other
trials
than
those
of
the
Old
Bailey
would
be
included
*NL*
in
the
package
of
books
we
received
from
London
;
among
these
my
husband
*NL*
found
and
read
with
avidity
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
THE
*NL*
TRIAL
*NL*
OF
*NL*
JAMES
STEWART
*NL*
in
Aucharn
in
Duror
of
Appin
*NL*
FOR
THE
*NL*
Murder
of
COLIN
CAMPBELL
of
Glenure
,
Efq
;
*NL*
Factor
for
His
Majefty
on
the
forfeited
*NL*
Estate
of
Ardfhiel
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
husband
was
always
interested
in
this
period
of
his
country
's
*NL*
history
,
and
had
already
the
intention
of
writing
a
story
that
should
*NL*
turn
on
the
Appin
murder
.
The
tale
was
to
be
of
a
boy
,
David
Balfour
,
*NL*
supposed
to
belong
to
my
husband
's
own
family
,
who
should
travel
in
*NL*
Scotland
as
though
it
were
a
foreign
country
,
meeting
with
various
*NL*
adventures
and
misadventures
by
the
way
.
From
the
trial
of
James
Stewart
*NL*
my
husband
gleaned
much
valuable
material
for
his
novel
,
the
most
*NL*
important
being
the
character
of
Alan
Breck
.
Aside
from
having
described
*NL*
him
as
``
smallish
in
stature
,
''
my
husband
seems
to
have
taken
Alan
*NL*
Breck
's
personal
appearance
,
even
to
his
clothing
,
from
the
book
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
letter
from
James
Stewart
to
Mr.
John
Macfarlane
,
introduced
as
*NL*
evidence
in
the
trial
,
says
:
``
There
is
one
Alan
Stewart
,
a
distant
*NL*
friend
of
the
late
Ardshiel
's
,
who
is
in
the
French
service
,
and
came
*NL*
over
in
March
last
,
as
he
said
to
some
,
in
order
to
settle
at
home
;
to
*NL*
others
,
that
he
was
to
go
soon
back
;
and
was
,
as
I
hear
,
the
day
that
*NL*
the
murder
was
committed
,
seen
not
far
from
the
place
where
it
happened
,
*NL*
and
is
not
now
to
be
seen
;
by
which
it
is
believed
he
was
the
actor
.
He
*NL*
is
a
desperate
foolish
fellow
;
and
if
he
is
guilty
,
came
to
the
country
*NL*
for
that
very
purpose
.
He
is
a
tall
,
pock-pitted
lad
,
very
black
hair
,
*NL*
and
wore
a
blue
coat
and
metal
buttons
,
an
old
red
vest
,
and
breeches
of
*NL*
the
same
colour
.
''
A
second
witness
testified
to
having
seen
him
wearing
*NL*
``
a
blue
coat
with
silver
buttons
,
a
red
waistcoat
,
black
shag
breeches
,
*NL*
tartan
hose
,
and
a
feathered
hat
,
with
a
big
coat
,
dun
coloured
,
''
a
*NL*
costume
referred
to
by
one
of
the
counsel
as
``
French
cloathes
which
were
*NL*
remarkable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
many
incidents
given
in
the
trial
that
point
to
Alan
's
fiery
*NL*
spirit
and
Highland
quickness
to
take
offence
.
One
witness
``
declared
*NL*
also
That
the
said
Alan
Breck
threatened
that
he
would
challenge
*NL*
Ballieveolan
and
his
sons
to
fight
because
of
his
removing
the
*NL*
declarant
last
year
from
Glenduror
.

sworn
,
purged
and

That
,
in
the
month
of
*NL*
April
last
,
the
deponent
met
with
Alan
Breck
Stewart
,
with
whom
he
was
*NL*
not
acquainted
,
and
John
Stewart
,
in
Auchnacoan
,
in
the
house
of
the
*NL*
walk
miller
of
Auchofragan
,
and
went
on
with
them
to
the
house
:
Alan
*NL*
Breck
Stewart
said
,
that
he
hated
all
the
name
of
Campbell
;
and
the
*NL*
deponent
said
,
he
had
no
reason
for
doing
so
:
But
Alan
said
,
he
had
very
*NL*
good
reason
for
it
:
that
thereafter
they
left
that
house
;
and
,
after
*NL*
drinking
a
dram
at
another
house
,
came
to
the
deponent
's
house
,
where
*NL*
they
went
in
,
and
drunk
some
drams
,
and
Alan
Breck
renewed
the
former
*NL*
Conversation
;
and
the
deponent
,
making
the
same
answer
,
Alan
said
,
that
,
*NL*
if
the
deponent
had
any
respect
for
his
friends
,
he
would
tell
them
,
*NL*
that
if
they
offered
to
turn
out
the
possessors
of
Ardshiel
's
estate
,
he
*NL*
would
make
black
cocks
of
them
,
before
they
entered
into
possession
by
*NL*
which
the
deponent
understood
shooting
them
,
it
being
a
common
phrase
in
*NL*
the
country
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Some
time
after
the
publication
of
Kidnapped
we
stopped
for
a
short
*NL*
while
in
the
Appin
country
,
where
we
were
surprised
and
interested
to
*NL*
discover
that
the
feeling
concerning
the
murder
of
Glenure
-LRB-
the
``
Red
*NL*
Fox
,
''
also
called
``
Colin
Roy
''
-RRB-
was
almost
as
keen
as
though
the
tragedy
*NL*
had
taken
place
the
day
before
.
For
several
years
my
husband
received
*NL*
letters
of
expostulation
or
commendation
from
members
of
the
Campbell
*NL*
and
Stewart
clans
.
I
have
in
my
possession
a
paper
,
yellow
with
age
,
*NL*
that
was
sent
soon
after
the
novel
appeared
,
containing
``
The
Pedigree
of
*NL*
the
Family
of
Appine
,
''
wherein
it
is
said
that
``
Alan
3rd
Baron
of
Appine
*NL*
was
not
killed
at
Flowdoun
,
tho
there
,
but
lived
to
a
great
old
age
.
He
*NL*
married
Cameron
Daughter
to
Ewen
Cameron
of
Lochiel
.
''
Following
this
*NL*
is
a
paragraph
stating
that
``
John
Stewart
1st
of
Ardsheall
of
his
*NL*
descendants
Alan
Breck
had
better
be
omitted

Duncan

*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
while
my
husband
was
busily
at
work
,
I
sat
beside
him
reading
*NL*
an
old
cookery
book
called
The
Compleat
Housewife
:
or
Accomplish
'd
*NL*
Gentlewoman
's
Companion
.
In
the
midst
of
receipts
for

mumbled

Pickled
Samphire
,
Skirret

and

other
forgotten
delicacies
,
there
were
directions
for
the
preparation
*NL*
of
several
lotions
for
the
preservation
of
beauty
.
One
of
these
was
so
*NL*
charming
that
I
interrupted
my
husband
to
read
it
aloud
.
``
Just
what
*NL*
I
wanted
!
''
he
exclaimed
;
and
the
receipt
for
the
``
Lily
of
the
Valley

Water

was
instantly
incorporated
into

DEDICATION
*NL*
*NL*
MY
DEAR
CHARLES
BAXTER
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
If
you
ever
read
this
tale
,
you
will
likely
ask
yourself
more
questions
*NL*
than
I
should
care
to
answer
:
as
for
instance
how
the
Appin
murder
has
*NL*
come
to
fall
in
the
year
1751
,
how
the
Torran
rocks
have
crept
so
near
*NL*
to
Earraid
,
or
why
the
printed
trial
is
silent
as
to
all
that
touches
*NL*
David
Balfour
.
These
are
nuts
beyond
my
ability
to
crack
.
But
if
you
*NL*
tried
me
on
the
point
of
Alan
's
guilt
or
innocence
,
I
think
I
could
*NL*
defend
the
reading
of
the
text
.
To
this
day
you
will
find
the
tradition
*NL*
of
Appin
clear
in
Alan
's
favour
.
If
you
inquire
,
you
may
even
hear
that
*NL*
the
descendants
of
``
the
other
man
''
who
fired
the
shot
are
in
the
country
*NL*
to
this
day
.
But
that
other
man
's
name
,
inquire
as
you
please
,
you
shall
*NL*
not
hear
;
for
the
Highlander
values
a
secret
for
itself
and
for
the
*NL*
congenial
exercise
of
keeping
it
.
I
might
go
on
for
long
to
justify
one
*NL*
point
and
own
another
indefensible
;
it
is
more
honest
to
confess
at
once
*NL*
how
little
I
am
touched
by
the
desire
of
accuracy
.
This
is
no
furniture
*NL*
for
the
scholar
's
library
,
but
a
book
for
the
winter
evening
school-room
*NL*
when
the
tasks
are
over
and
the
hour
for
bed
draws
near
;
and
honest
*NL*
Alan
,
who
was
a
grim
old
fire-eater
in
his
day
has
in
this
new
avatar
*NL*
no
more
desperate
purpose
than
to
steal
some
young
gentleman
's
attention
*NL*
from
his
Ovid
,
carry
him
awhile
into
the
Highlands
and
the
last
century
,
*NL*
and
pack
him
to
bed
with
some
engaging
images
to
mingle
with
his
dreams
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
you
,
my
dear
Charles
,
I
do
not
even
ask
you
to
like
this
tale
.
*NL*
But
perhaps
when
he
is
older
,
your
son
will
;
he
may
then
be
pleased
to
*NL*
find
his
father
's
name
on
the
fly-leaf
;
and
in
the
meanwhile
it
pleases
*NL*
me
to
set
it
there
,
in
memory
of
many
days
that
were
happy
and
some
-LRB-
now
*NL*
perhaps
as
pleasant
to
remember
-RRB-
that
were
sad
.
If
it
is
strange
for
*NL*
me
to
look
back
from
a
distance
both
in
time
and
space
on
these
bygone
*NL*
adventures
of
our
youth
,
it
must
be
stranger
for
you
who
tread
the
same
*NL*
streets
--
who
may
to-morrow
open
the
door
of
the
old
Speculative
,
*NL*
where
we
begin
to
rank
with
Scott
and
Robert
Emmet
and
the
beloved
and
*NL*
inglorious
Macbean
--
or
may
pass
the
corner
of
the
close
where
that
great
*NL*
society
,
the
L.
J.
R.
,
held
its
meetings
and
drank
its
beer
,
sitting
in
*NL*
the
seats
of
Burns
and
his
companions
.
I
think
I
see
you
,
moving
there
*NL*
by
plain
daylight
,
beholding
with
your
natural
eyes
those
places
that
*NL*
have
now
become
for
your
companion
a
part
of
the
scenery
of
dreams
.
How
,
*NL*
in
the
intervals
of
present
business
,
the
past
must
echo
in
your
memory
!
*NL*
Let
it
not
echo
often
without
some
kind
thoughts
of
your
friend

year
of
grace
1751
,
when
I
took
the
key
for
the
*NL*
last
time
out
of
the
door
of
my
father
's
house
.
The
sun
began
to
shine
*NL*
upon
the
summit
of
the
hills
as
I
went
down
the
road
;
and
by
the
time
*NL*
I
had
come
as
far
as
the
manse
,
the
blackbirds
were
whistling
in
the
*NL*
garden
lilacs
,
and
the
mist
that
hung
around
the
valley
in
the
time
of
*NL*
the
dawn
was
beginning
to
arise
and
die
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Campbell
,
the
minister
of
Essendean
,
was
waiting
for
me
by
the
*NL*
garden
gate
,
good
man
!
He
asked
me
if
I
had
breakfasted
;
and
hearing
*NL*
that
I
lacked
for
nothing
,
he
took
my
hand
in
both
of
his
and
clapped
it
*NL*
kindly
under
his
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Davie
,
lad
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
will
go
with
you
as
far
as
the
ford
,
to
*NL*
set
you
on
the
way
.
''
And
we
began
to
walk
forward
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
ye
sorry
to
leave
Essendean
?
''
said
he
,
after
awhile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
sir
,
''
said
I
,
``
if
I
knew
where
I
was
going
,
or
what
was
likely
*NL*
to
become
of
me
,
I
would
tell
you
candidly
.
Essendean
is
a
good
place
*NL*
indeed
,
and
I
have
been
very
happy
there
;
but
then
I
have
never
been
*NL*
anywhere
else
.
My
father
and
mother
,
since
they
are
both
dead
,
I
shall
*NL*
be
no
nearer
to
in
Essendean
than
in
the
Kingdom
of
Hungary
,
and
,
to
*NL*
speak
truth
,
if
I
thought
I
had
a
chance
to
better
myself
where
I
was
*NL*
going
I
would
go
with
a
good
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
?
''
said
Mr.
Campbell
.
``
Very
well
,
Davie
.
Then
it
behoves
me
to
tell
*NL*
your
fortune
;
or
so
far
as
I
may
.
When
your
mother
was
gone
,
and
your
*NL*
father
-LRB-
the
worthy
,
Christian
man
-RRB-
began
to
sicken
for
his
end
,
he
gave
*NL*
me
in
charge
a
certain
letter
,
which
he
said
was
your
inheritance
.
`
So
*NL*
soon
,
'
says
he
,
`
as
I
am
gone
,
and
the
house
is
redd
up
and
the
gear
*NL*
disposed
of
'
-LRB-
all
which
,
Davie
,
hath
been
done
-RRB-
,
`
give
my
boy
this
*NL*
letter
into
his
hand
,
and
start
him
off
to
the
house
of
Shaws
,
not
far
*NL*
from
Cramond
.
That
is
the
place
I
came
from
,
'
he
said
,
`
and
it
's
where
*NL*
it
befits
that
my
boy
should
return
.
He
is
a
steady
lad
,
'
your
father
*NL*
said
,
`
and
a
canny
goer
;
and
I
doubt
not
he
will
come
safe
,
and
be
well
*NL*
lived
where
he
goes
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
house
of
Shaws
!
''
I
cried
.
``
What
had
my
poor
father
to
do
with
the
*NL*
house
of
Shaws
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
''
said
Mr.
Campbell
,
``
who
can
tell
that
for
a
surety
?
But
the
name
*NL*
of
that
family
,
Davie
,
boy
,
is
the
name
you
bear
--
Balfours
of
Shaws
:
*NL*
an
ancient
,
honest
,
reputable
house
,
peradventure
in
these
latter
*NL*
days
decayed
.
Your
father
,
too
,
was
a
man
of
learning
as
befitted
his
*NL*
position
;
no
man
more
plausibly
conducted
school
;
nor
had
he
the
manner
*NL*
or
the
speech
of
a
common
dominie
;
but
-LRB-
as
ye
will
yourself
remember
-RRB-
*NL*
I
took
aye
a
pleasure
to
have
him
to
the
manse
to
meet
the
gentry
;
and
*NL*
those
of
my
own
house
,
Campbell
of
Kilrennet
,
Campbell
of
Dunswire
,
*NL*
Campbell
of
Minch
,
and
others
,
all
well-kenned
gentlemen
,
had
pleasure
*NL*
in
his
society
.
Lastly
,
to
put
all
the
elements
of
this
affair
before
*NL*
you
,
here
is
the
testamentary
letter
itself
,
superscrived
by
the
own
*NL*
hand
of
our
departed
brother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
gave
me
the
letter
,
which
was
addressed
in
these
words
:
``
To
the
hands
*NL*
of
Ebenezer
Balfour
,
Esquire
,
of
Shaws
,
in
his
house
of
Shaws
,
these
*NL*
will
be
delivered
by
my
son
,
David
Balfour
.
''
My
heart
was
beating
hard
*NL*
at
this
great
prospect
now
suddenly
opening
before
a
lad
of
seventeen
*NL*
years
of
age
,
the
son
of
a
poor
country
dominie
in
the
Forest
of
*NL*
Ettrick
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Campbell
,
''
I
stammered
,
``
and
if
you
were
in
my
shoes
,
would
you
*NL*
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
a
surety
,
''
said
the
minister
,
``
that
would
I
,
and
without
pause
.
*NL*
A
pretty
lad
like
you
should
get
to
Cramond
-LRB-
which
is
near
in
by
*NL*
Edinburgh
-RRB-
in
two
days
of
walk
.
If
the
worst
came
to
the
worst
,
and
*NL*
your
high
relations
-LRB-
as
I
can
not
but
suppose
them
to
be
somewhat
of
your
*NL*
blood
-RRB-
should
put
you
to
the
door
,
ye
can
but
walk
the
two
days
back
*NL*
again
and
risp
at
the
manse
door
.
But
I
would
rather
hope
that
ye
shall
*NL*
be
well
received
,
as
your
poor
father
forecast
for
you
,
and
for
anything
*NL*
that
I
ken
come
to
be
a
great
man
in
time
.
And
here
,
Davie
,
laddie
,
''
he
*NL*
resumed
,
``
it
lies
near
upon
my
conscience
to
improve
this
parting
,
and
*NL*
set
you
on
the
right
guard
against
the
dangers
of
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
he
cast
about
for
a
comfortable
seat
,
lighted
on
a
big
boulder
*NL*
under
a
birch
by
the
trackside
,
sate
down
upon
it
with
a
very
long
,
*NL*
serious
upper
lip
,
and
the
sun
now
shining
in
upon
us
between
two
peaks
,
*NL*
put
his
pocket-handkerchief
over
his
cocked
hat
to
shelter
him
.
There
,
*NL*
then
,
with
uplifted
forefinger
,
he
first
put
me
on
my
guard
against
a
*NL*
considerable
number
of
heresies
,
to
which
I
had
no
temptation
,
and
urged
*NL*
upon
me
to
be
instant
in
my
prayers
and
reading
of
the
Bible
.
That
done
,
*NL*
he
drew
a
picture
of
the
great
house
that
I
was
bound
to
,
and
how
I
*NL*
should
conduct
myself
with
its
inhabitants
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
soople
,
Davie
,
in
things
immaterial
,
''
said
he
.
``
Bear
ye
this
in
*NL*
mind
,
that
,
though
gentle
born
,
ye
have
had
a
country
rearing

Dinnae
*NL*
shame
us

Davie

dinnae
shame

In
yon
great
,
muckle
house
,
with
all
*NL*
these
domestics
,
upper
and
under
,
show
yourself
as
nice
,
as
circumspect
,
*NL*
as
quick
at
the
conception
,
and
as
slow
of
speech
as
any
.
As
for
the
*NL*
laird
--
remember
he
's
the
laird
;
I
say
no
more
:
honour
to
whom
honour
.
*NL*
It
's
a
pleasure
to
obey
a
laird
;
or
should
be
,
to
the
young
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
''
said
I
,
``
it
may
be
;
and
I
'll
promise
you
I
'll
try
to
make
*NL*
it
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
very
well
said
,
''
replied
Mr.
Campbell
,
heartily
.
``
And
now
to
come
*NL*
to
the
material
,
or
-LRB-
to
make
a
quibble
-RRB-
to
the
immaterial
.
I
have
here
*NL*
a
little
packet
which
contains
four
things
.
''
He
tugged
it
,
as
he
spoke
,
*NL*
and
with
some
great
difficulty
,
from
the
skirt
pocket
of
his
coat
.
``
Of
*NL*
these
four
things
,
the
first
is
your
legal
due
:
the
little
pickle
money
*NL*
for
your
father
's
books
and
plenishing
,
which
I
have
bought
-LRB-
as
I
have
*NL*
explained
from
the
first
-RRB-
in
the
design
of
re-selling
at
a
profit
to
*NL*
the
incoming
dominie
.
The
other
three
are
gifties
that
Mrs.
Campbell
and
*NL*
myself
would
be
blithe
of
your
acceptance
.
The
first
,
which
is
round
,
*NL*
will
likely
please
ye
best
at
the
first
off-go
;
but
,
O
Davie
,
laddie
,
*NL*
it
's
but
a
drop
of
water
in
the
sea
;
it
'll
help
you
but
a
step
,
and
*NL*
vanish
like
the
morning
.
The
second
,
which
is
flat
and
square
and
*NL*
written
upon
,
will
stand
by
you
through
life
,
like
a
good
staff
for
the
*NL*
road
,
and
a
good
pillow
to
your
head
in
sickness
.
And
as
for
the
last
,
*NL*
which
is
cubical
,
that
'll
see
you
,
it
's
my
prayerful
wish
,
into
a
better
*NL*
land
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
that
he
got
upon
his
feet
,
took
off
his
hat
,
and
prayed
a
little
*NL*
while
aloud
,
and
in
affecting
terms
,
for
a
young
man
setting
out
into
*NL*
the
world
;
then
suddenly
took
me
in
his
arms
and
embraced
me
very
hard
;
*NL*
then
held
me
at
arm
's
length
,
looking
at
me
with
his
face
all
working
*NL*
with
sorrow
;
and
then
whipped
about
,
and
crying
good-bye
to
me
,
set
off
*NL*
backward
by
the
way
that
we
had
come
at
a
sort
of
jogging
run
.
It
might
*NL*
have
been
laughable
to
another
;
but
I
was
in
no
mind
to
laugh
.
I
watched
*NL*
him
as
long
as
he
was
in
sight
;
and
he
never
stopped
hurrying
,
nor
once
*NL*
looked
back
.
Then
it
came
in
upon
my
mind
that
this
was
all
his
sorrow
*NL*
at
my
departure
;
and
my
conscience
smote
me
hard
and
fast
,
because
I
,
*NL*
for
my
part
,
was
overjoyed
to
get
away
out
of
that
quiet
country-side
,
*NL*
and
go
to
a
great
,
busy
house
,
among
rich
and
respected
gentlefolk
of
my
*NL*
own
name
and
blood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Davie
,
Davie
,
''
I
thought
,
``
was
ever
seen
such
black
ingratitude
?
Can
*NL*
you
forget
old
favours
and
old
friends
at
the
mere
whistle
of
a
name
?
*NL*
Fie
,
fie
;
think
shame
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
I
sat
down
on
the
boulder
the
good
man
had
just
left
,
and
opened
the
*NL*
parcel
to
see
the
nature
of
my
gifts
.
That
which
he
had
called
cubical
,
*NL*
I
had
never
had
much
doubt
of
;
sure
enough
it
was
a
little
Bible
,
to
*NL*
carry
in
a
plaid-neuk
.
That
which
he
had
called
round
,
I
found
to
be
a
*NL*
shilling
piece
;
and
the
third
,
which
was
to
help
me
so
wonderfully
both
*NL*
in
health
and
sickness
all
the
days
of
my
life
,
was
a
little
piece
of
*NL*
coarse
yellow
paper
,
written
upon
thus
in
red
ink
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
TO
MAKE
LILLY
OF
THE
VALLEY
WATER
.
--
Take
the
flowers
of
lilly
of
the
*NL*
valley
and
distil
them
in
sack
,
and
drink
a
spooneful
or
two
as
there
is
*NL*
occasion
.
It
restores
speech
to
those
that
have
the
dumb
palsey
.
It
is
*NL*
good
against
the
Gout
;
it
comforts
the
heart
and
strengthens
the
memory
;
*NL*
and
the
flowers
,
put
into
a
Glasse
,
close
stopt
,
and
set
into
ane
hill
*NL*
of
ants
for
a
month
,
then
take
it
out
,
and
you
will
find
a
liquor
which
*NL*
comes
from
the
flowers
,
which
keep
in
a
vial
;
it
is
good
,
ill
or
well
,
*NL*
and
whether
man
or
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
,
in
the
minister
's
own
hand
,
was
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Likewise
for
sprains
,
rub
it
in
;
and
for
the
cholic
,
a
great
spooneful
*NL*
in
the
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
To
be
sure
,
I
laughed
over
this
;
but
it
was
rather
tremulous
laughter
;
*NL*
and
I
was
glad
to
get
my
bundle
on
my
staff
's
end
and
set
out
over
the
*NL*
ford
and
up
the
hill
upon
the
farther
side
;
till
,
just
as
I
came
on
the
*NL*
green
drove-road
running
wide
through
the
heather
,
I
took
my
last
look
*NL*
of
Kirk
Essendean
,
the
trees
about
the
manse
,
and
the
big
rowans
in
the
*NL*
kirkyard
where
my
father
and
my
mother
lay
.

CHAPTER
II
*NL*
*NL*
I
COME
TO
MY
JOURNEY
'S
END
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
forenoon
of
the
second
day
,
coming
to
the
top
of
a
hill
,
I
saw
*NL*
all
the
country
fall
away
before
me
down
to
the
sea
;
and
in
the
midst
*NL*
of
this
descent
,
on
a
long
ridge
,
the
city
of
Edinburgh
smoking
like
*NL*
a
kiln
.
There
was
a
flag
upon
the
castle
,
and
ships
moving
or
lying
*NL*
anchored
in
the
firth
;
both
of
which
,
for
as
far
away
as
they
were
,
I
*NL*
could
distinguish
clearly
;
and
both
brought
my
country
heart
into
my
*NL*
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
after
,
I
came
by
a
house
where
a
shepherd
lived
,
and
got
a
*NL*
rough
direction
for
the
neighbourhood
of
Cramond
;
and
so
,
from
one
to
*NL*
another
,
worked
my
way
to
the
westward
of
the
capital
by
Colinton
,
till
*NL*
I
came
out
upon
the
Glasgow
road
.
And
there
,
to
my
great
pleasure
and
*NL*
wonder
,
I
beheld
a
regiment
marching
to
the
fifes
,
every
foot
in
time
;
*NL*
an
old
red-faced
general
on
a
grey
horse
at
the
one
end
,
and
at
the
*NL*
other
the
company
of
Grenadiers
,
with
their
Pope
's
-
hats
.
The
pride
of
*NL*
life
seemed
to
mount
into
my
brain
at
the
sight
of
the
red
coats
and
the
*NL*
hearing
of
that
merry
music
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
little
farther
on
,
and
I
was
told
I
was
in
Cramond
parish
,
and
began
*NL*
to
substitute
in
my
inquiries
the
name
of
the
house
of
Shaws
.
It
was
a
*NL*
word
that
seemed
to
surprise
those
of
whom
I
sought
my
way
.
At
first
I
*NL*
thought
the
plainness
of
my
appearance
,
in
my
country
habit
,
and
that
*NL*
all
dusty
from
the
road
,
consorted
ill
with
the
greatness
of
the
place
*NL*
to
which
I
was
bound
.
But
after
two
,
or
maybe
three
,
had
given
me
the
*NL*
same
look
and
the
same
answer
,
I
began
to
take
it
in
my
head
there
was
*NL*
something
strange
about
the
Shaws
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
better
to
set
this
fear
at
rest
,
I
changed
the
form
of
my
inquiries
;
*NL*
and
spying
an
honest
fellow
coming
along
a
lane
on
the
shaft
of
his
*NL*
cart
,
I
asked
him
if
he
had
ever
heard
tell
of
a
house
they
called
the
*NL*
house
of
Shaws
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stopped
his
cart
and
looked
at
me
,
like
the
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
''
said
he
.
``
What
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
great
house
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doubtless
,
''
says
he
.
``
The
house
is
a
big
,
muckle
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
''
said
I
,
``
but
the
folk
that
are
in
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Folk
?
''
cried
he
.
``
Are
ye
daft
?
There
's
nae
folk
there
--
to
call
folk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
say
I
;
``
not
Mr.
Ebenezer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ou
,
ay
''
says
the
man
;
``
there
's
the
laird
,
to
be
sure
,
if
it
's
him
*NL*
you
're
wanting
.
What
'll
like
be
your
business
,
mannie
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
led
to
think
that
I
would
get
a
situation
,
''
I
said
,
looking
as
*NL*
modest
as
I
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
cries
the
carter
,
in
so
sharp
a
note
that
his
very
horse
*NL*
started
;
and
then
,
``
Well
,
mannie
,
''
he
added
,
``
it
's
nane
of
my
affairs
;
*NL*
but
ye
seem
a
decent-spoken
lad
;
and
if
ye
'll
take
a
word
from
me
,
ye
'll
*NL*
keep
clear
of
the
Shaws
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
person
I
came
across
was
a
dapper
little
man
in
a
beautiful
*NL*
white
wig
,
whom
I
saw
to
be
a
barber
on
his
rounds
;
and
knowing
well
*NL*
that
barbers
were
great
gossips
,
I
asked
him
plainly
what
sort
of
a
man
*NL*
was
Mr.
Balfour
of
the
Shaws
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hoot
,
hoot
,
hoot
,
''
said
the
barber
,
``
nae
kind
of
a
man
,
nae
kind
of
a
*NL*
man
at
all
;
''
and
began
to
ask
me
very
shrewdly
what
my
business
was
;
*NL*
but
I
was
more
than
a
match
for
him
at
that
,
and
he
went
on
to
his
next
*NL*
customer
no
wiser
than
he
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
can
not
well
describe
the
blow
this
dealt
to
my
illusions
.
The
more
*NL*
indistinct
the
accusations
were
,
the
less
I
liked
them
,
for
they
left
*NL*
the
wider
field
to
fancy
.
What
kind
of
a
great
house
was
this
,
that
all
*NL*
the
parish
should
start
and
stare
to
be
asked
the
way
to
it
?
or
what
*NL*
sort
of
a
gentleman
,
that
his
ill-fame
should
be
thus
current
on
the
*NL*
wayside
?
If
an
hour
's
walking
would
have
brought
me
back
to
Essendean
,
I
*NL*
had
left
my
adventure
then
and
there
,
and
returned
to
Mr.
Campbell
's
.
*NL*
But
when
I
had
come
so
far
a
way
already
,
mere
shame
would
not
suffer
me
*NL*
to
desist
till
I
had
put
the
matter
to
the
touch
of
proof
;
I
was
bound
,
*NL*
out
of
mere
self-respect
,
to
carry
it
through
;
and
little
as
I
liked
*NL*
the
sound
of
what
I
heard
,
and
slow
as
I
began
to
travel
,
I
still
kept
*NL*
asking
my
way
and
still
kept
advancing
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
drawing
on
to
sundown
when
I
met
a
stout
,
dark
,
sour-looking
*NL*
woman
coming
trudging
down
a
hill
;
and
she
,
when
I
had
put
my
usual
*NL*
question
,
turned
sharp
about
,
accompanied
me
back
to
the
summit
she
had
*NL*
just
left
,
and
pointed
to
a
great
bulk
of
building
standing
very
bare
*NL*
upon
a
green
in
the
bottom
of
the
next
valley
.
The
country
was
pleasant
*NL*
round
about
,
running
in
low
hills
,
pleasantly
watered
and
wooded
,
and
*NL*
the
crops
,
to
my
eyes
,
wonderfully
good
;
but
the
house
itself
appeared
*NL*
to
be
a
kind
of
ruin
;
no
road
led
up
to
it
;
no
smoke
arose
from
any
of
*NL*
the
chimneys
;
nor
was
there
any
semblance
of
a
garden
.
My
heart
sank
.
*NL*
``
That
!
''
I
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
's
face
lit
up
with
a
malignant
anger
.
``
That
is
the
house
of
*NL*
Shaws
!
''
she
cried
.
``
Blood
built
it
;
blood
stopped
the
building
of
it
;
*NL*
blood
shall
bring
it
down
.
See
here
!
''
she
cried
again
--
``
I
spit
upon
*NL*
the
ground
,
and
crack
my
thumb
at
it
!
Black
be
its
fall
!
If
ye
see
the
*NL*
laird
,
tell
him
what
ye
hear
;
tell
him
this
makes
the
twelve
hunner
and
*NL*
nineteen
time
that
Jennet
Clouston
has
called
down
the
curse
on
him
*NL*
and
his
house
,
byre
and
stable
,
man
,
guest
,
and
master
,
wife
,
miss
,
or
*NL*
bairn
--
black
,
black
be
their
fall
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
woman
,
whose
voice
had
risen
to
a
kind
of
eldritch
sing-song
,
*NL*
turned
with
a
skip
,
and
was
gone
.
I
stood
where
she
left
me
,
with
my
*NL*
hair
on
end
.
In
those
days
folk
still
believed
in
witches
and
trembled
*NL*
at
a
curse
;
and
this
one
,
falling
so
pat
,
like
a
wayside
omen
,
to
arrest
*NL*
me
ere
I
carried
out
my
purpose
,
took
the
pith
out
of
my
legs
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
sat
me
down
and
stared
at
the
house
of
Shaws
.
The
more
I
looked
,
*NL*
the
pleasanter
that
country-side
appeared
;
being
all
set
with
hawthorn
*NL*
bushes
full
of
flowers
;
the
fields
dotted
with
sheep
;
a
fine
flight
of
*NL*
rooks
in
the
sky
;
and
every
sign
of
a
kind
soil
and
climate
;
and
yet
the
*NL*
barrack
in
the
midst
of
it
went
sore
against
my
fancy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Country
folk
went
by
from
the
fields
as
I
sat
there
on
the
side
of
the
*NL*
ditch
,
but
I
lacked
the
spirit
to
give
them
a
good-e
`
en
.
At
last
the
sun
*NL*
went
down
,
and
then
,
right
up
against
the
yellow
sky
,
I
saw
a
scroll
of
*NL*
smoke
go
mounting
,
not
much
thicker
,
as
it
seemed
to
me
,
than
the
smoke
*NL*
of
a
candle
;
but
still
there
it
was
,
and
meant
a
fire
,
and
warmth
,
and
*NL*
cookery
,
and
some
living
inhabitant
that
must
have
lit
it
;
and
this
*NL*
comforted
my
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
I
set
forward
by
a
little
faint
track
in
the
grass
that
led
in
my
*NL*
direction
.
It
was
very
faint
indeed
to
be
the
only
way
to
a
place
*NL*
of
habitation
;
yet
I
saw
no
other
.
Presently
it
brought
me
to
stone
*NL*
uprights
,
with
an
unroofed
lodge
beside
them
,
and
coats
of
arms
upon
*NL*
the
top
.
A
main
entrance
it
was
plainly
meant
to
be
,
but
never
finished
;
*NL*
instead
of
gates
of
wrought
iron
,
a
pair
of
hurdles
were
tied
across
*NL*
with
a
straw
rope
;
and
as
there
were
no
park
walls
,
nor
any
sign
of
*NL*
avenue
,
the
track
that
I
was
following
passed
on
the
right
hand
of
the
*NL*
pillars
,
and
went
wandering
on
toward
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
nearer
I
got
to
that
,
the
drearier
it
appeared
.
It
seemed
like
the
*NL*
one
wing
of
a
house
that
had
never
been
finished
.
What
should
have
been
*NL*
the
inner
end
stood
open
on
the
upper
floors
,
and
showed
against
the
sky
*NL*
with
steps
and
stairs
of
uncompleted
masonry
.
Many
of
the
windows
were
*NL*
unglazed
,
and
bats
flew
in
and
out
like
doves
out
of
a
dove-cote
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
night
had
begun
to
fall
as
I
got
close
;
and
in
three
of
the
lower
*NL*
windows
,
which
were
very
high
up
and
narrow
,
and
well
barred
,
the
*NL*
changing
light
of
a
little
fire
began
to
glimmer
.
Was
this
the
palace
*NL*
I
had
been
coming
to
?
Was
it
within
these
walls
that
I
was
to
seek
*NL*
new
friends
and
begin
great
fortunes
?
Why
,
in
my
father
's
house
on
*NL*
Essen-Waterside
,
the
fire
and
the
bright
lights
would
show
a
mile
away
,
*NL*
and
the
door
open
to
a
beggar
's
knock
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
came
forward
cautiously
,
and
giving
ear
as
I
came
,
heard
some
one
*NL*
rattling
with
dishes
,
and
a
little
dry
,
eager
cough
that
came
in
fits
;
*NL*
but
there
was
no
sound
of
speech
,
and
not
a
dog
barked
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
,
as
well
as
I
could
see
it
in
the
dim
light
,
was
a
great
piece
*NL*
of
wood
all
studded
with
nails
;
and
I
lifted
my
hand
with
a
faint
heart
*NL*
under
my
jacket
,
and
knocked
once
.
Then
I
stood
and
waited
.
The
house
*NL*
had
fallen
into
a
dead
silence
;
a
whole
minute
passed
away
,
and
nothing
*NL*
stirred
but
the
bats
overhead
.
I
knocked
again
,
and
hearkened
again
.
*NL*
By
this
time
my
ears
had
grown
so
accustomed
to
the
quiet
,
that
I
*NL*
could
hear
the
ticking
of
the
clock
inside
as
it
slowly
counted
out
the
*NL*
seconds
;
but
whoever
was
in
that
house
kept
deadly
still
,
and
must
have
*NL*
held
his
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
in
two
minds
whether
to
run
away
;
but
anger
got
the
upper
hand
,
*NL*
and
I
began
instead
to
rain
kicks
and
buffets
on
the
door
,
and
to
shout
*NL*
out
aloud
for
Mr.
Balfour
.
I
was
in
full
career
,
when
I
heard
the
cough
*NL*
right
overhead
,
and
jumping
back
and
looking
up
,
beheld
a
man
's
head
*NL*
in
a
tall
nightcap
,
and
the
bell
mouth
of
a
blunderbuss
,
at
one
of
the
*NL*
first-storey
windows
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
loaded
,
''
said
a
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
come
here
with
a
letter
,
''
I
said
,
``
to
Mr.
Ebenezer
Balfour
of
*NL*
Shaws
.
Is
he
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
whom
is
it
?
''
asked
the
man
with
the
blunderbuss
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
neither
here
nor
there
,
''
said
I
,
for
I
was
growing
very
wroth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
was
the
reply
,
``
ye
can
put
it
down
upon
the
doorstep
,
and
be
off
*NL*
with
ye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
do
no
such
thing
,
''
I
cried
.
``
I
will
deliver
it
into
Mr.
*NL*
Balfour
's
hands
,
as
it
was
meant
I
should
.
It
is
a
letter
of
*NL*
introduction
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
what
?
''
cried
the
voice
,
sharply
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
repeated
what
I
had
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
are
ye
,
yourself
?
''
was
the
next
question
,
after
a
considerable
*NL*
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
ashamed
of
my
name
,
''
said
I.
``
They
call
me
David
Balfour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
,
I
made
sure
the
man
started
,
for
I
heard
the
blunderbuss
rattle
*NL*
on
the
window-sill
;
and
it
was
after
quite
a
long
pause
,
and
with
a
*NL*
curious
change
of
voice
,
that
the
next
question
followed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
your
father
dead
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
so
much
surprised
at
this
,
that
I
could
find
no
voice
to
answer
,
*NL*
but
stood
staring
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
''
the
man
resumed
,
``
he
'll
be
dead
,
no
doubt
;
and
that
'll
be
what
*NL*
brings
ye
chapping
to
my
door
.
''
Another
pause
,
and
then
defiantly
,
*NL*
``
Well
,
man
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
'll
let
ye
in
;
''
and
he
disappeared
from
the
*NL*
window
.

CHAPTER
III
*NL*
*NL*
I
MAKE
ACQUAINTANCE
OF
MY
UNCLE
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
there
came
a
great
rattling
of
chains
and
bolts
,
and
the
*NL*
door
was
cautiously
opened
and
shut
to
again
behind
me
as
soon
as
I
had
*NL*
passed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
into
the
kitchen
and
touch
naething
,
''
said
the
voice
;
and
while
the
*NL*
person
of
the
house
set
himself
to
replacing
the
defences
of
the
door
,
I
*NL*
groped
my
way
forward
and
entered
the
kitchen
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fire
had
burned
up
fairly
bright
,
and
showed
me
the
barest
room
I
*NL*
think
I
ever
put
my
eyes
on
.
Half-a-dozen
dishes
stood
upon
the
shelves
;
*NL*
the
table
was
laid
for
supper
with
a
bowl
of
porridge
,
a
horn
spoon
,
and
*NL*
a
cup
of
small
beer
.
Besides
what
I
have
named
,
there
was
not
another
*NL*
thing
in
that
great
,
stone-vaulted
,
empty
chamber
but
lockfast
chests
*NL*
arranged
along
the
wall
and
a
corner
cupboard
with
a
padlock
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
the
last
chain
was
up
,
the
man
rejoined
me
.
He
was
a
mean
,
*NL*
stooping
,
narrow-shouldered
,
clay-faced
creature
;
and
his
age
might
have
*NL*
been
anything
between
fifty
and
seventy
.
His
nightcap
was
of
flannel
,
*NL*
and
so
was
the
nightgown
that
he
wore
,
instead
of
coat
and
waistcoat
,
*NL*
over
his
ragged
shirt
.
He
was
long
unshaved
;
but
what
most
distressed
*NL*
and
even
daunted
me
,
he
would
neither
take
his
eyes
away
from
me
nor
*NL*
look
me
fairly
in
the
face
.
What
he
was
,
whether
by
trade
or
birth
,
was
*NL*
more
than
I
could
fathom
;
but
he
seemed
most
like
an
old
,
unprofitable
*NL*
serving-man
,
who
should
have
been
left
in
charge
of
that
big
house
upon
*NL*
board
wages
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
ye
sharp-set
?
''
he
asked
,
glancing
at
about
the
level
of
my
knee
.
*NL*
``
Ye
can
eat
that
drop
parritch
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
I
feared
it
was
his
own
supper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
can
do
fine
wanting
it
.
I
'll
take
the
ale
,
though
,
for
*NL*
it
slockens
-LRB-
moistens
-RRB-
my
cough
.
''
He
drank
the
cup
about
half
out
,
still
*NL*
keeping
an
eye
upon
me
as
he
drank
;
and
then
suddenly
held
out
his
hand
.
*NL*
``
Let
's
see
the
letter
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
the
letter
was
for
Mr.
Balfour
;
not
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
do
ye
think
I
am
?
''
says
he
.
``
Give
me
Alexander
's
letter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
my
father
's
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
strange
if
I
didnae
,
''
he
returned
,
``
for
he
was
my
born
*NL*
brother
;
and
little
as
ye
seem
to
like
either
me
or
my
house
,
or
my
good
*NL*
parritch
,
I
'm
your
born
uncle
,
Davie
,
my
man
,
and
you
my
born
nephew
.
So
*NL*
give
us
the
letter
,
and
sit
down
and
fill
your
kyte
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
I
had
been
some
years
younger
,
what
with
shame
,
weariness
,
and
*NL*
disappointment
,
I
believe
I
had
burst
into
tears
.
As
it
was
,
I
could
*NL*
find
no
words
,
neither
black
nor
white
,
but
handed
him
the
letter
,
and
*NL*
sat
down
to
the
porridge
with
as
little
appetite
for
meat
as
ever
a
*NL*
young
man
had
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
my
uncle
,
stooping
over
the
fire
,
turned
the
letter
over
and
*NL*
over
in
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
ye
ken
what
's
in
it
?
''
he
asked
,
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
for
yourself
,
sir
,
''
said
I
,
``
that
the
seal
has
not
been
*NL*
broken
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
''
said
he
,
``
but
what
brought
you
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
give
the
letter
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
says
he
,
cunningly
,
``
but
ye
'll
have
had
some
hopes
,
nae
doubt
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
confess
,
sir
,
''
said
I
,
``
when
I
was
told
that
I
had
kinsfolk
*NL*
well-to-do
,
I
did
indeed
indulge
the
hope
that
they
might
help
me
in
*NL*
my
life
.
But
I
am
no
beggar
;
I
look
for
no
favours
at
your
hands
,
and
*NL*
I
want
none
that
are
not
freely
given
.
For
as
poor
as
I
appear
,
I
have
*NL*
friends
of
my
own
that
will
be
blithe
to
help
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hoot-toot
!
''
said
Uncle
Ebenezer
,
``
dinnae
fly
up
in
the
snuff
at
me
.
*NL*
We
'll
agree
fine
yet
.
And
,
Davie
,
my
man
,
if
you
're
done
with
that
bit
*NL*
parritch
,
I
could
just
take
a
sup
of
it
myself
.
Ay
,
''
he
continued
,
*NL*
as
soon
as
he
had
ousted
me
from
the
stool
and
spoon
,
``
they
're
fine
,
*NL*
halesome
food
--
they
're
grand
food
,
parritch
.
''
He
murmured
a
little
grace
*NL*
to
himself
and
fell
to
.
``
Your
father
was
very
fond
of
his
meat
,
I
mind
;
*NL*
he
was
a
hearty
,
if
not
a
great
eater
;
but
as
for
me
,
I
could
never
*NL*
do
mair
than
pyke
at
food
.
''
He
took
a
pull
at
the
small
beer
,
which
*NL*
probably
reminded
him
of
hospitable
duties
,
for
his
next
speech
ran
*NL*
thus
:
``
If
ye
're
dry
ye
'll
find
water
behind
the
door
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
I
returned
no
answer
,
standing
stiffly
on
my
two
feet
,
and
*NL*
looking
down
upon
my
uncle
with
a
mighty
angry
heart
.
He
,
on
his
part
,
*NL*
continued
to
eat
like
a
man
under
some
pressure
of
time
,
and
to
throw
*NL*
out
little
darting
glances
now
at
my
shoes
and
now
at
my
home-spun
*NL*
stockings
.
Once
only
,
when
he
had
ventured
to
look
a
little
higher
,
our
*NL*
eyes
met
;
and
no
thief
taken
with
a
hand
in
a
man
's
pocket
could
have
*NL*
shown
more
lively
signals
of
distress
.
This
set
me
in
a
muse
,
whether
*NL*
his
timidity
arose
from
too
long
a
disuse
of
any
human
company
;
and
*NL*
whether
perhaps
,
upon
a
little
trial
,
it
might
pass
off
,
and
my
uncle
*NL*
change
into
an
altogether
different
man
.
From
this
I
was
awakened
by
his
*NL*
sharp
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
father
's
been
long
dead
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Three
weeks
,
sir
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
a
secret
man
,
Alexander
--
a
secret
,
silent
man
,
''
he
continued
.
*NL*
``
He
never
said
muckle
when
he
was
young
.
He
'll
never
have
spoken
muckle
*NL*
of
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
knew
,
sir
,
till
you
told
it
me
yourself
,
that
he
had
any
*NL*
brother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
me
,
dear
me
!
''
said
Ebenezer
.
``
Nor
yet
of
Shaws
,
I
dare
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
so
much
as
the
name
,
sir
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
think
o
'
that
!
''
said
he
.
``
A
strange
nature
of
a
man
!
''
For
all
that
,
*NL*
he
seemed
singularly
satisfied
,
but
whether
with
himself
,
or
me
,
or
*NL*
with
this
conduct
of
my
father
's
,
was
more
than
I
could
read
.
Certainly
,
*NL*
however
,
he
seemed
to
be
outgrowing
that
distaste
,
or
ill-will
,
that
he
*NL*
had
conceived
at
first
against
my
person
;
for
presently
he
jumped
up
,
*NL*
came
across
the
room
behind
me
,
and
hit
me
a
smack
upon
the
shoulder
.
*NL*
``
We
'll
agree
fine
yet
!
''
he
cried
.
``
I
'm
just
as
glad
I
let
you
in
.
And
*NL*
now
come
awa
'
to
your
bed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
my
surprise
,
he
lit
no
lamp
or
candle
,
but
set
forth
into
the
dark
*NL*
passage
,
groped
his
way
,
breathing
deeply
,
up
a
flight
of
steps
,
and
*NL*
paused
before
a
door
,
which
he
unlocked
.
I
was
close
upon
his
heels
,
*NL*
having
stumbled
after
him
as
best
I
might
;
and
then
he
bade
me
go
in
,
*NL*
for
that
was
my
chamber
.
I
did
as
he
bid
,
but
paused
after
a
few
steps
,
*NL*
and
begged
a
light
to
go
to
bed
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hoot-toot
!
''
said
Uncle
Ebenezer
,
``
there
's
a
fine
moon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Neither
moon
nor
star
,
sir
,
and
pit-mirk
,
''
*
said
I.
``
I
cannae
see
the
*NL*
bed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*
Dark
as
the
pit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hoot-toot
,
hoot-toot
!
''
said
he
.
``
Lights
in
a
house
is
a
thing
I
dinnae
*NL*
agree
with
.
I
'm
unco
feared
of
fires
.
Good-night
to
ye
,
Davie
,
my
man
.
''
*NL*
And
before
I
had
time
to
add
a
further
protest
,
he
pulled
the
door
to
,
*NL*
and
I
heard
him
lock
me
in
from
the
outside
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
not
know
whether
to
laugh
or
cry
.
The
room
was
as
cold
as
a
well
,
*NL*
and
the
bed
,
when
I
had
found
my
way
to
it
,
as
damp
as
a
peat-hag
;
but
*NL*
by
good
fortune
I
had
caught
up
my
bundle
and
my
plaid
,
and
rolling
*NL*
myself
in
the
latter
,
I
lay
down
upon
the
floor
under
lee
of
the
big
*NL*
bedstead
,
and
fell
speedily
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
first
peep
of
day
I
opened
my
eyes
,
to
find
myself
in
a
great
*NL*
chamber
,
hung
with
stamped
leather
,
furnished
with
fine
embroidered
*NL*
furniture
,
and
lit
by
three
fair
windows
.
Ten
years
ago
,
or
perhaps
*NL*
twenty
,
it
must
have
been
as
pleasant
a
room
to
lie
down
or
to
awake
in
*NL*
as
a
man
could
wish
;
but
damp
,
dirt
,
disuse
,
and
the
mice
and
spiders
*NL*
had
done
their
worst
since
then
.
Many
of
the
window-panes
,
besides
,
were
*NL*
broken
;
and
indeed
this
was
so
common
a
feature
in
that
house
,
that
I
*NL*
believe
my
uncle
must
at
some
time
have
stood
a
siege
from
his
indignant
*NL*
neighbours
--
perhaps
with
Jennet
Clouston
at
their
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
the
sun
was
shining
outside
;
and
being
very
cold
in
that
*NL*
miserable
room
,
I
knocked
and
shouted
till
my
gaoler
came
and
let
me
*NL*
out
.
He
carried
me
to
the
back
of
the
house
,
where
was
a
draw-well
,
and
*NL*
told
me
to
``
wash
my
face
there
,
if
I
wanted
;
''
and
when
that
was
done
,
*NL*
I
made
the
best
of
my
own
way
back
to
the
kitchen
,
where
he
had
lit
the
*NL*
fire
and
was
making
the
porridge
.
The
table
was
laid
with
two
bowls
and
*NL*
two
horn
spoons
,
but
the
same
single
measure
of
small
beer
.
Perhaps
my
*NL*
eye
rested
on
this
particular
with
some
surprise
,
and
perhaps
my
uncle
*NL*
observed
it
;
for
he
spoke
up
as
if
in
answer
to
my
thought
,
asking
me
if
*NL*
I
would
like
to
drink
ale
--
for
so
he
called
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
such
was
my
habit
,
but
not
to
put
himself
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Na
,
na
,
''
said
he
;
``
I
'll
deny
you
nothing
in
reason
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
fetched
another
cup
from
the
shelf
;
and
then
,
to
my
great
surprise
,
*NL*
instead
of
drawing
more
beer
,
he
poured
an
accurate
half
from
one
cup
*NL*
to
the
other
.
There
was
a
kind
of
nobleness
in
this
that
took
my
breath
*NL*
away
;
if
my
uncle
was
certainly
a
miser
,
he
was
one
of
that
thorough
*NL*
breed
that
goes
near
to
make
the
vice
respectable
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
had
made
an
end
of
our
meal
,
my
uncle
Ebenezer
unlocked
a
*NL*
drawer
,
and
drew
out
of
it
a
clay
pipe
and
a
lump
of
tobacco
,
from
which
*NL*
he
cut
one
fill
before
he
locked
it
up
again
.
Then
he
sat
down
in
the
*NL*
sun
at
one
of
the
windows
and
silently
smoked
.
From
time
to
time
his
*NL*
eyes
came
coasting
round
to
me
,
and
he
shot
out
one
of
his
questions
.
*NL*
Once
it
was
,
``
And
your
mother
?
''
and
when
I
had
told
him
that
she
,
too
,
*NL*
was
dead
,
``
Ay
,
she
was
a
bonnie
lassie
!
''
Then
,
after
another
long
pause
,
*NL*
``
Whae
were
these
friends
o
'
yours
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
they
were
different
gentlemen
of
the
name
of
Campbell
;
*NL*
though
,
indeed
,
there
was
only
one
,
and
that
the
minister
,
that
had
ever
*NL*
taken
the
least
note
of
me
;
but
I
began
to
think
my
uncle
made
too
light
*NL*
of
my
position
,
and
finding
myself
all
alone
with
him
,
I
did
not
wish
*NL*
him
to
suppose
me
helpless
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
seemed
to
turn
this
over
in
his
mind
;
and
then
,
``
Davie
,
my
man
,
''
said
*NL*
he
,
``
ye
've
come
to
the
right
bit
when
ye
came
to
your
uncle
Ebenezer
.
*NL*
I
've
a
great
notion
of
the
family
,
and
I
mean
to
do
the
right
by
you
;
*NL*
but
while
I
'm
taking
a
bit
think
to
mysel
'
of
what
's
the
best
thing
to
*NL*
put
you
to
--
whether
the
law
,
or
the
meenistry
,
or
maybe
the
army
,
whilk
*NL*
is
what
boys
are
fondest
of
--
I
wouldnae
like
the
Balfours
to
be
humbled
*NL*
before
a
wheen
Hieland
Campbells
,
and
I
'll
ask
you
to
keep
your
tongue
*NL*
within
your
teeth
.
Nae
letters
;
nae
messages
;
no
kind
of
word
to
*NL*
onybody
;
or
else

there
's
my
door

*NL*
*NL*
``
Uncle
Ebenezer

''
said
I
,
``
I
've
no
manner
of
reason
to
suppose
you
mean
*NL*
anything

well
by
me

For
all
that
,
I
would
have
you
to
know
that
I
*NL*
have
a
pride
of
my

It
was
by
no
will
of
mine
that
I
came
seeking
*NL*
you
;
and
if
you
show
me
your
door
again
,
I
'll
take
you
at
the
word

*NL*
*NL*
He
seemed
grievously
put
out
.
``
Hoots-toots
,
''
said
he
,
``

cannie

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
Very

said
I
,
``

It
seemed
to
me
-LRB-
too
soon
,
I
dare
say
-RRB-
that
I
was
getting
the
upper
*NL*
hand
of
my
uncle
;
and
I
began
next
to
say
that
I
must
have
the
bed
and
*NL*
bedclothes
aired
and
put
to
sun-dry
;
for
nothing
would
make
me
sleep
in
*NL*
such
a
pickle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
this
my
house
or
yours
?
''
said
he
,
in
his
keen
voice
,
and
then
all
of
*NL*
a
sudden
broke
off
.
``
Na
,
na
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
didnae
mean
that
.
What
's
mine
*NL*
is
yours
,
Davie
,
my
man
,
and
what
's
yours
is
mine
.
Blood
's
thicker
than
*NL*
water
;
and
there
's
naebody
but
you
and
me
that
ought
the
name
.
''
And
*NL*
then
on
he
rambled
about
the
family
,
and
its
ancient
greatness
,
and
his
*NL*
father
that
began
to
enlarge
the
house
,
and
himself
that
stopped
the
*NL*
building
as
a
sinful
waste
;
and
this
put
it
in
my
head
to
give
him
*NL*
Jennet
Clouston
's
message
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
limmer
!
''
he
cried
.
``
Twelve
hunner
and
fifteen
--
that
's
every
day
*NL*
since
I
had
the

I
'll
have

a
proclaimed
witch
!
I
'll
aff
and
*NL*
see
the
session
clerk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*
Sold
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
with
that
he
opened
a
chest
,
and
got
out
a
very
old
and
*NL*
well-preserved
blue
coat
and
waistcoat
,
and
a
good
enough
beaver
hat
,
*NL*
both
without
lace
.
These
he
threw
on
any
way
,
and
taking
a
staff
from
*NL*
the
cupboard
,
locked
all
up
again
,
and
was
for
setting
out
,
when
a
*NL*
thought
arrested
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
cannae
leave
you
by
yoursel
'
in
the
house
,
''
said
he
.
``
I
'll
have
to
*NL*
lock
you
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
blood
came
to
my
face
.
``
If
you
lock
me
out
,
''
I
said
,
``
it
'll
be
the
*NL*
last
you
'll
see
of
me
in
friendship
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
very
pale
,
and
sucked
his
mouth
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
no
the
way
,
''
he
said
,
looking
wickedly
at
a
corner
of
the
*NL*
floor
--
``
this
is
no
the
way
to
win
my
favour
,
David
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
says
I
,
``
with
a
proper
reverence
for
your
age
and
our
common
*NL*
blood
,
I
do
not
value
your
favour
at

boddle
's
purchase
.
I
was
brought
*NL*
up
to
have
a
good
conceit
of
myself
;
and
if
you
were
all
the
uncle
,
and
*NL*
all
the
family
,
I
had
in
the

ten
times
over

would
n't
buy
your

such
prices

''
*NL*
*NL*
Uncle
Ebenezer
went
and
looked
out
of
the
window
for
awhile
.
I
could
*NL*
see
him
all
trembling
and
twitching
,
like
a
man
with
palsy
.
But
when
he
*NL*
turned
round
,
he
had
a
smile
upon
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
''
said
he
,
``
we
must
bear
and
forbear

I
'll
no

that
's
all
*NL*
that
's
to

of
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Uncle
Ebenezer
,
''
I
said
,
``
I
can
make
nothing
out
of
this
.
You
use
me
*NL*
like
a
thief
;
you
hate
to
have
me
in
this
house

you
let
me
see

*NL*
every

every

not

*NL*
as

I
've
spoken
to

I
never

*NL*
Why
do
you
seek

then

Let

*NL*
*NL*
``
Na

he
said
,
very
earnestly
.
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

said
I
,
after
I
had
thought
the
matter
out
in
silence
,
*NL*
``
I
'll
stay
awhile

It
's
more
just
I
should
be
helped
by
my

if

CHAPTER
IV
*NL*
*NL*
I
RUN
A
GREAT
DANGER
IN
THE
HOUSE
OF
SHAWS
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
day
that
was
begun
so
ill
,
the
day
passed
fairly
well
.
We
had
the
*NL*
porridge
cold
again
at
noon
,
and
hot
porridge
at
night
;
porridge
and
*NL*
small
beer
was
my
uncle
's
diet
.
He
spoke
but
little
,
and
that
in
the
*NL*
same
way
as
before
,
shooting
a
question
at
me
after
a
long
silence
;
and
*NL*
when
I
sought
to
lead
him
to
talk
about
my
future
,
slipped
out
of
it
*NL*
again
.
In
a
room
next
door
to
the
kitchen
,
where
he
suffered
me
to
go
,
*NL*
I
found
a
great
number
of
books
,
both
Latin
and
English
,
in
which
I
took
*NL*
great
pleasure
all
the
afternoon
.
Indeed
,
the
time
passed
so
lightly
in
*NL*
this
good
company
,
that
I
began
to
be
almost
reconciled
to
my
residence
*NL*
at
Shaws
;
and
nothing
but
the
sight
of
my
uncle
,
and
his
eyes
playing
*NL*
hide
and
seek
with
mine
,
revived
the
force
of
my
distrust
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
thing
I
discovered
,
which
put
me
in
some
doubt
.
This
was
an
entry
on
*NL*
the
fly-leaf
of
a
chap-book
-LRB-
one
of
Patrick
Walker
's
-RRB-
plainly
written
*NL*
by
my
father
's
hand
and
thus
conceived
:
``
To
my
brother
Ebenezer
on
his
*NL*
fifth
birthday
.
''
Now
,
what
puzzled
me
was
this
:
That
,
as
my
father
was
of
*NL*
course
the
younger
brother
,
he
must
either
have
made
some
strange
error
,
*NL*
or
he
must
have
written
,
before
he
was
yet
five
,
an
excellent
,
clear
*NL*
manly
hand
of
writing
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
tried
to
get
this
out
of
my
head
;
but
though
I
took
down
many
*NL*
interesting
authors
,
old
and
new
,
history
,
poetry
,
and
story-book
,
this
*NL*
notion
of
my
father
's
hand
of
writing
stuck
to
me
;
and
when
at
length
I
*NL*
went
back
into
the
kitchen
,
and
sat
down
once
more
to
porridge
and
small
*NL*
beer
,
the
first
thing
I
said
to
Uncle
Ebenezer
was
to
ask
him
if
my
*NL*
father
had
not
been
very
quick
at
his
book
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alexander
?
No
him
!
''
was
the
reply
.
``
I
was
far
quicker
mysel
'
;
I
was
a
*NL*
clever
chappie
when
I
was
young
.
Why
,
I
could
read
as
soon
as
he
could
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
puzzled
me
yet
more
;
and
a
thought
coming
into
my
head
,
I
asked
if
*NL*
he
and
my
father
had
been
twins
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
jumped
upon
his
stool
,
and
the
horn
spoon
fell
out
of
his
hand
upon
*NL*
the
floor
.
``
What
gars
ye
ask
that
?
''
he
said
,
and
he
caught
me
by
the
*NL*
breast
of
the
jacket
,
and
looked
this
time
straight
into
my
eyes
:
*NL*
his
own
were
little
and
light
,
and
bright
like
a
bird
's
,
blinking
and
*NL*
winking
strangely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
''
I
asked
,
very
calmly
,
for
I
was
far
stronger
than
*NL*
he
,
and
not
easily
frightened
.
``
Take
your
hand
from
my
jacket
.
This
is
*NL*
no
way
to
behave
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
uncle
seemed
to
make
a
great
effort
upon
himself
.
``
Dod
man
,
David
,
''
*NL*
he
said
,
``
ye
should-nae
speak
to
me
about
your
father
.
That
's
where
the
*NL*
mistake
is
.
''
He
sat
awhile
and
shook
,
blinking
in
his
plate
:
``
He
was
all
*NL*
the
brother
that
ever
I
had
,
''
he
added
,
but
with
no
heart
in
his
voice
;
*NL*
and
then
he
caught
up
his
spoon
and
fell
to
supper
again
,
but
still
*NL*
shaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
this
last
passage
,
this
laying
of
hands
upon
my
person
and
*NL*
sudden
profession
of
love
for
my
dead
father
,
went
so
clean
beyond
my
*NL*
comprehension
that
it
put
me
into
both
fear
and
hope
.
On
the
one
hand
,
*NL*
I
began
to
think
my
uncle
was
perhaps
insane
and
might
be
dangerous
;
*NL*
on
the
other
,
there
came
up
into
my
mind
-LRB-
quite
unbidden
by
me
and
even
*NL*
discouraged
-RRB-
a
story
like
some
ballad
I
had
heard
folk
singing
,
of
a
*NL*
poor
lad
that
was
a
rightful
heir
and
a
wicked
kinsman
that
tried
*NL*
to
keep
him
from
his
own
.
For
why
should
my
uncle
play
a
part
with
a
*NL*
relative
that
came
,
almost
a
beggar
,
to
his
door
,
unless
in
his
heart
he
*NL*
had
some
cause
to
fear
him
?
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
notion
,
all
unacknowledged
,
but
nevertheless
getting
firmly
*NL*
settled
in
my
head
,
I
now
began
to
imitate
his
covert
looks
;
so
that
*NL*
we
sat
at
table
like
a
cat
and
a
mouse
,
each
stealthily
observing
the
*NL*
other
.
Not
another
word
had
he
to
say
to
me
,
black
or
white
,
but
was
*NL*
busy
turning
something
secretly
over
in
his
mind
;
and
the
longer
we
*NL*
sat
and
the
more
I
looked
at
him
,
the
more
certain
I
became
that
the
*NL*
something
was
unfriendly
to
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
cleared
the
platter
,
he
got
out
a
single
pipeful
of
tobacco
,
*NL*
just
as
in
the
morning
,
turned
round
a
stool
into
the
chimney
corner
,
*NL*
and
sat
awhile
smoking
,
with
his
back
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Davie
,
''
he
said
,
at
length
,
``
I
've
been
thinking
;
''
then
he
paused
,
and
*NL*
said
it
again
.
``
There
's
a
wee
bit
siller
that
I
half
promised
ye
before
*NL*
ye
were
born
,
''
he
continued
;
``
promised
it
to
your
father
.
O
,
naething
*NL*
legal
,
ye
understand
;
just
gentlemen
daffing
at
their
wine
.
Well
,
I
*NL*
keepit
that
bit
money
separate
--
it
was
a
great
expense
,
but
a
promise
*NL*
is
a
promise
--
and
it
has
grown
by
now
to
be
a
matter
of
just
*NL*
precisely
--
just
exactly
''
--
and
here
he
paused
and
stumbled
--
``
of
just
*NL*
exactly
forty
pounds
!
''
This
last
he
rapped
out
with
a
sidelong
glance
*NL*
over
his
shoulder
;
and
the
next
moment
added
,
almost
with
a
scream
,
*NL*
``
Scots
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
pound
Scots
being
the
same
thing
as
an
English
shilling
,
the
*NL*
difference
made
by
this
second
thought
was
considerable
;
I
could
see
,
*NL*
besides
,
that
the
whole
story
was
a
lie
,
invented
with
some
end
which
*NL*
it
puzzled
me
to
guess
;
and
I
made
no
attempt
to
conceal
the
tone
of
*NL*
raillery
in
which
I
answered
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
think
again
,
sir
!
Pounds
sterling
,
I
believe
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
what
I
said
,
''
returned
my
uncle
:
``
pounds
sterling
!
And
if
you
'll
*NL*
step
out-by
to
the
door
a
minute
,
just
to
see
what
kind
of
a
night
it
*NL*
is
,
I
'll
get
it
out
to
ye
and
call
ye
in
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
his
will
,
smiling
to
myself
in
my
contempt
that
he
should
think
I
*NL*
was
so
easily
to
be
deceived
.
It
was
a
dark
night
,
with
a
few
stars
low
*NL*
down
;
and
as
I
stood
just
outside
the
door
,
I
heard
a
hollow
moaning
*NL*
of
wind
far
off
among
the
hills
.
I
said
to
myself
there
was
something
*NL*
thundery
and
changeful
in
the
weather
,
and
little
knew
of
what
a
vast
*NL*
importance
that
should
prove
to
me
before
the
evening
passed
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
was
called
in
again
,
my
uncle
counted
out
into
my
hand
seven
and
*NL*
thirty
golden
guinea
pieces
;
the
rest
was
in
his
hand
,
in
small
gold
and
*NL*
silver
;
but
his
heart
failed
him
there
,
and
he
crammed
the
change
into
*NL*
his
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
''
said
he
,
``
that
'll
show
you
!
I
'm
a
queer
man
,
and
strange
wi
'
*NL*
strangers
;
but
my
word
is
my
bond
,
and
there
's
the
proof
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
my
uncle
seemed
so
miserly
that
I
was
struck
dumb
by
this
sudden
*NL*
generosity
,
and
could
find
no
words
in
which
to
thank
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
a
word
!
''
said
he
.
``
Nae
thanks
;
I
want
nae
thanks
.
I
do
my
duty
.
I
'm
*NL*
no
saying
that
everybody
would
have
done
it
;
but
for
my
part
-LRB-
though
*NL*
I
'm
a
careful
body
,
too
-RRB-
it
's
a
pleasure
to
me
to
do
the
right
by
my
*NL*
brother
's
son
;
and
it
's
a
pleasure
to
me
to
think
that
now
we
'll
agree
*NL*
as
such
near
friends
should
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
spoke
him
in
return
as
handsomely
as
I
was
able
;
but
all
the
while
*NL*
I
was
wondering
what
would
come
next
,
and
why
he
had
parted
with
his
*NL*
precious
guineas
;
for
as
to
the
reason
he
had
given
,
a
baby
would
have
*NL*
refused
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
he
looked
towards
me
sideways
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
see
here
,
''
says
he
,
``
tit
for
tat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
I
was
ready
to
prove
my
gratitude
in
any
reasonable
degree
,
*NL*
and
then
waited
,
looking
for
some
monstrous
demand
.
And
yet
,
when
*NL*
at
last
he
plucked
up
courage
to
speak
,
it
was
only
to
tell
me
-LRB-
very
*NL*
properly
,
as
I
thought
-RRB-
that
he
was
growing
old
and
a
little
broken
,
and
*NL*
that
he
would
expect
me
to
help
him
with
the
house
and
the
bit
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
answered
,
and
expressed
my
readiness
to
serve
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
said
,
``
let
's
begin
.
''
He
pulled
out
of
his
pocket
a
rusty
key
.
*NL*
``
There
,
''
says
he
,
``
there
's
the
key
of
the
stair-tower
at
the
far
end
of
*NL*
the
house
.
Ye
can
only
win
into
it
from
the
outside
,
for
that
part
of
*NL*
the
house
is
no
finished
.
Gang
ye
in
there
,
and
up
the
stairs
,
and
bring
*NL*
me
down
the
chest
that
's
at
the
top
.
There
's
papers
i
n't
,
''
he
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
I
have
a
light
,
sir
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Na
,
''
said
he
,
very
cunningly
.
``
Nae
lights
in
my
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
sir
,
''
said
I.
``
Are
the
stairs
good
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
grand
,
''
said
he
;
and
then
,
as
I
was
going
,
``
Keep
to
the
wall
,
''
*NL*
he
added
;
``
there
's
nae
bannisters
.
But
the
stairs
are
grand
underfoot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Out
I
went
into
the
night
.
The
wind
was
still
moaning
in
the
distance
,
*NL*
though
never
a
breath
of
it
came
near
the
house
of
Shaws
.
It
had
fallen
*NL*
blacker
than
ever
;
and
I
was
glad
to
feel
along
the
wall
,
till
I
came
*NL*
the
length
of
the
stairtower
door
at
the
far
end
of
the
unfinished
wing
.
*NL*
I
had
got
the
key
into
the
keyhole
and
had
just
turned
it
,
when
all
upon
*NL*
a
sudden
,
without
sound
of
wind
or
thunder
,
the
whole
sky
lighted
up
*NL*
with
wild
fire
and
went
black
again
.
I
had
to
put
my
hand
over
my
eyes
*NL*
to
get
back
to
the
colour
of
the
darkness
;
and
indeed
I
was
already
half
*NL*
blinded
when
I
stepped
into
the
tower
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
so
dark
inside
,
it
seemed
a
body
could
scarce
breathe
;
but
I
*NL*
pushed
out
with
foot
and
hand
,
and
presently
struck
the
wall
with
the
*NL*
one
,
and
the
lowermost
round
of
the
stair
with
the
other
.
The
wall
,
by
*NL*
the
touch
,
was
of
fine
hewn
stone
;
the
steps
too
,
though
somewhat
steep
*NL*
and
narrow
,
were
of
polished
masonwork
,
and
regular
and
solid
underfoot
.
*NL*
Minding
my
uncle
's
word
about
the
bannisters
,
I
kept
close
to
the
tower
*NL*
side
,
and
felt
my
way
in
the
pitch
darkness
with
a
beating
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
house
of
Shaws
stood
some
five
full
storeys
high
,
not
counting
*NL*
lofts
.
Well
,
as
I
advanced
,
it
seemed
to
me
the
stair
grew
airier
and
a
*NL*
thought
more
lightsome
;
and
I
was
wondering
what
might
be
the
cause
of
*NL*
this
change
,
when
a
second
blink
of
the
summer
lightning
came
and
went
.
*NL*
If
I
did
not
cry
out
,
it
was
because
fear
had
me
by
the
throat
;
and
if
I
*NL*
did
not
fall
,
it
was
more
by
Heaven
's
mercy
than
my
own
strength
.
It
was
*NL*
not
only
that
the
flash
shone
in
on
every
side
through
breaches
in
the
*NL*
wall
,
so
that
I
seemed
to
be
clambering
aloft
upon
an
open
scaffold
,
but
*NL*
the
same
passing
brightness
showed
me
the
steps
were
of
unequal
length
,
*NL*
and
that
one
of
my
feet
rested
that
moment
within
two
inches
of
the
*NL*
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
grand
stair
!
I
thought
;
and
with
the
thought
,
a
gust
of
*NL*
a
kind
of
angry
courage
came
into
my
heart
.
My
uncle
had
sent
me
here
,
*NL*
certainly
to
run
great
risks
,
perhaps
to
die
.
I
swore
I
would
settle
*NL*
that
``
perhaps
,
''
if
I
should
break
my
neck
for
it
;
got
me
down
upon
my
*NL*
hands
and
knees
;
and
as
slowly
as
a
snail
,
feeling
before
me
every
*NL*
inch
,
and
testing
the
solidity
of
every
stone
,
I
continued
to
ascend
*NL*
the
stair
.
The
darkness
,
by
contrast
with
the
flash
,
appeared
to
have
*NL*
redoubled
;
nor
was
that
all
,
for
my
ears
were
now
troubled
and
my
mind
*NL*
confounded
by
a
great
stir
of
bats
in
the
top
part
of
the
tower
,
and
the
*NL*
foul
beasts
,
flying
downwards
,
sometimes
beat
about
my
face
and
body
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tower
,
I
should
have
said
,
was
square
;
and
in
every
corner
the
step
*NL*
was
made
of
a
great
stone
of
a
different
shape
to
join
the
flights
.
*NL*
Well
,
I
had
come
close
to
one
of
these
turns
,
when
,
feeling
forward
*NL*
as
usual
,
my
hand
slipped
upon
an
edge
and
found
nothing
but
emptiness
*NL*
beyond
it
.
The
stair
had
been
carried
no
higher
;
to
set
a
stranger
*NL*
mounting
it
in
the
darkness
was
to
send
him
straight
to
his
death
;
and
*NL*
-LRB-
although
,
thanks
to
the
lightning
and
my
own
precautions
,
I
was
safe
*NL*
enough
-RRB-
the
mere
thought
of
the
peril
in
which
I
might
have
stood
,
and
*NL*
the
dreadful
height
I
might
have
fallen
from
,
brought
out
the
sweat
upon
*NL*
my
body
and
relaxed
my
joints
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
knew
what
I
wanted
now
,
and
turned
and
groped
my
way
down
again
,
*NL*
with
a
wonderful
anger
in
my
heart
.
About
half-way
down
,
the
wind
sprang
*NL*
up
in
a
clap
and
shook
the
tower
,
and
died
again
;
the
rain
followed
;
and
*NL*
before
I
had
reached
the
ground
level
it
fell
in
buckets
.
I
put
out
my
*NL*
head
into
the
storm
,
and
looked
along
towards
the
kitchen
.
The
door
,
*NL*
which
I
had
shut
behind
me
when
I
left
,
now
stood
open
,
and
shed
a
*NL*
little
glimmer
of
light
;
and
I
thought
I
could
see
a
figure
standing
*NL*
in
the
rain
,
quite
still
,
like
a
man
hearkening
.
And
then
there
came
*NL*
a
blinding
flash
,
which
showed
me
my
uncle
plainly
,
just
where
I
had
*NL*
fancied
him
to
stand
;
and
hard
upon
the
heels
of
it
,
a
great
tow-row
of
*NL*
thunder
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
whether
my
uncle
thought
the
crash
to
be
the
sound
of
my
fall
,
or
*NL*
whether
he
heard
in
it
God
's
voice
denouncing
murder
,
I
will
leave
you
*NL*
to
guess
.
Certain
it
is
,
at
least
,
that
he
was
seized
on
by
a
kind
of
*NL*
panic
fear
,
and
that
he
ran
into
the
house
and
left
the
door
open
behind
*NL*
him
.
I
followed
as
softly
as
I
could
,
and
,
coming
unheard
into
the
*NL*
kitchen
,
stood
and
watched
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
found
time
to
open
the
corner
cupboard
and
bring
out
a
great
case
*NL*
bottle
of
aqua
vitae
,
and
now
sat
with
his
back
towards
me
at
the
table
.
*NL*
Ever
and
again
he
would
be
seized
with
a
fit
of
deadly
shuddering
and
*NL*
groan
aloud
,
and
carrying
the
bottle
to
his
lips
,
drink
down
the
raw
*NL*
spirits
by
the
mouthful
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
stepped
forward
,
came
close
behind
him
where
he
sat
,
and
suddenly
*NL*
clapping
my
two
hands
down
upon
his
shoulders
--
``
Ah
!
''
cried
I.
*NL*
*NL*
My
uncle
gave
a
kind
of
broken
cry
like
a
sheep
's
bleat
,
flung
up
his
*NL*
arms
,
and
tumbled
to
the
floor
like
a
dead
man
.
I
was
somewhat
shocked
*NL*
at
this
;
but
I
had
myself
to
look
to
first
of
all
,
and
did
not
hesitate
*NL*
to
let
him
lie
as
he
had
fallen
.
The
keys
were
hanging
in
the
cupboard
;
*NL*
and
it
was
my
design
to
furnish
myself
with
arms
before
my
uncle
should
*NL*
come
again
to
his
senses
and
the
power
of
devising
evil
.
In
the
cupboard
*NL*
were
a
few
bottles
,
some
apparently
of
medicine
;
a
great
many
bills
and
*NL*
other
papers
,
which
I
should
willingly
enough
have
rummaged
,
had
I
had
*NL*
the
time
;
and
a
few
necessaries
that
were
nothing
to
my
purpose
.
Thence
*NL*
I
turned
to
the
chests
.
The
first
was
full
of
meal
;
the
second
of
*NL*
moneybags
and
papers
tied
into
sheaves
;
in
the
third
,
with
many
*NL*
other
things
-LRB-
and
these
for
the
most
part
clothes
-RRB-
I
found
a
rusty
,
*NL*
ugly-looking
Highland
dirk
without
the
scabbard
.
This
,
then
,
I
concealed
*NL*
inside
my
waistcoat
,
and
turned
to
my
uncle
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
lay
as
he
had
fallen
,
all
huddled
,
with
one
knee
up
and
one
arm
*NL*
sprawling
abroad
;
his
face
had
a
strange
colour
of
blue
,
and
he
seemed
*NL*
to
have
ceased
breathing
.
Fear
came
on
me
that
he
was
dead
;
then
I
*NL*
got
water
and
dashed
it
in
his
face
;
and
with
that
he
seemed
to
come
a
*NL*
little
to
himself
,
working
his
mouth
and
fluttering
his
eyelids
.
At
last
*NL*
he
looked
up
and
saw
me
,
and
there
came
into
his
eyes
a
terror
that
was
*NL*
not
of
this
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
come
,
''
said
I
;
``
sit
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
ye
alive
?
''
he
sobbed
.
``
O
man
,
are
ye
alive
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
am
I
,
''
said
I.
``
Small
thanks
to
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
begun
to
seek
for
his
breath
with
deep
sighs
.
``
The
blue
phial
,
''
*NL*
said
he
--
``
in
the
aumry
--
the
blue
phial
.
''
His
breath
came
slower
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
ran
to
the
cupboard
,
and
,
sure
enough
,
found
there
a
blue
phial
*NL*
of
medicine
,
with
the
dose
written
on
it
on
a
paper
,
and
this
I
*NL*
administered
to
him
with
what
speed
I
might
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
the
trouble
,
''
said
he
,
reviving
a
little
;
``
I
have
a
trouble
,
*NL*
Davie
.
It
's
the
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
set
him
on
a
chair
and
looked
at
him
.
It
is
true
I
felt
some
pity
for
*NL*
a
man
that
looked
so
sick
,
but
I
was
full
besides
of
righteous
anger
;
*NL*
and
I
numbered
over
before
him
the
points
on
which
I
wanted
explanation
:
*NL*
why
he
lied
to
me
at
every
word
;
why
he
feared
that
I
should
leave
him
;
*NL*
why
he
disliked
it
to
be
hinted
that
he
and
my
father
were
twins
--
``
Is
*NL*
that
because
it
is
true
?
''
I
asked
;
why
he
had
given
me
money
to
which
I
*NL*
was
convinced
I
had
no
claim
;
and
,
last
of
all
,
why
he
had
tried
to
kill
*NL*
me
.
He
heard
me
all
through
in
silence
;
and
then
,
in
a
broken
voice
,
*NL*
begged
me
to
let
him
go
to
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
ye
the
morn
,
''
he
said
;
``
as
sure
as
death
I
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
weak
was
he
that
I
could
do
nothing
but
consent
.
I
locked
him
*NL*
into
his
room
,
however
,
and
pocketed
the
key
,
and
then
returning
to
*NL*
the
kitchen
,
made
up
such
a
blaze
as
had
not
shone
there
for
many
a
long
*NL*
year
,
and
wrapping
myself
in
my
plaid
,
lay
down
upon
the
chests
and
fell
*NL*
asleep
.

CHAPTER
V
*NL*
*NL*
I
GO
TO
THE
QUEEN
'S
FERRY
*NL*
*NL*
Much
rain
fell
in
the
night
;
and
the
next
morning
there
blew
a
bitter
*NL*
wintry
wind
out
of
the
north-west
,
driving
scattered
clouds
.
For
all
*NL*
that
,
and
before
the
sun
began
to
peep
or
the
last
of
the
stars
had
*NL*
vanished
,
I
made
my
way
to
the
side
of
the
burn
,
and
had
a
plunge
in
a
*NL*
deep
whirling
pool
.
All
aglow
from
my
bath
,
I
sat
down
once
more
*NL*
beside
the
fire
,
which
I
replenished
,
and
began
gravely
to
consider
my
*NL*
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
now
no
doubt
about
my
uncle
's
enmity
;
there
was
no
doubt
I
*NL*
carried
my
life
in
my
hand
,
and
he
would
leave
no
stone
unturned
that
*NL*
he
might
compass
my
destruction
.
But
I
was
young
and
spirited
,
and
*NL*
like
most
lads
that
have
been
country-bred
,
I
had
a
great
opinion
of
my
*NL*
shrewdness
.
I
had
come
to
his
door
no
better
than
a
beggar
and
little
*NL*
more
than
a
child
;
he
had
met
me
with
treachery
and
violence
;
it
would
*NL*
be
a
fine
consummation
to
take
the
upper
hand
,
and
drive
him
like
a
herd
*NL*
of
sheep
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
sat
there
nursing
my
knee
and
smiling
at
the
fire
;
and
I
saw
myself
in
*NL*
fancy
smell
out
his
secrets
one
after
another
,
and
grow
to
be
that
man
's
*NL*
king
and
ruler
.
The
warlock
of
Essendean
,
they
say
,
had
made
a
mirror
in
*NL*
which
men
could
read
the
future
;
it
must
have
been
of
other
stuff
than
*NL*
burning
coal
;
for
in
all
the
shapes
and
pictures
that
I
sat
and
gazed
*NL*
at
,
there
was
never
a
ship
,
never
a
seaman
with
a
hairy
cap
,
never
a
big
*NL*
bludgeon
for
my
silly
head
,
or
the
least
sign
of
all
those
tribulations
*NL*
that
were
ripe
to
fall
on
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
,
all
swollen
with
conceit
,
I
went
up-stairs
and
gave
my
*NL*
prisoner
his
liberty
.
He
gave
me
good-morning
civilly
;
and
I
gave
the
*NL*
same
to
him
,
smiling
down
upon
him
,
from
the
heights
of
my
sufficiency
.
*NL*
Soon
we
were
set
to
breakfast
,
as
it
might
have
been
the
day
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
''
said
I
,
with
a
jeering
tone
,
``
have
you
nothing
more
to
say
*NL*
to
me
?
''
And
then
,
as
he
made
no
articulate
reply
,
``
It
will
be
time
,
*NL*
I
think
,
to
understand
each
other
,
''
I
continued
.
``
You
took
me
for
*NL*
a
country
Johnnie
Raw
,
with
no
more
mother-wit
or
courage
than
a
*NL*
porridge-stick
.
I
took
you
for
a
good
man
,
or
no
worse
than
others
at
*NL*
the
least
.
It
seems
we
were
both
wrong
.
What
cause
you
have
to
fear
me
,
*NL*
to
cheat
me
,
and
to
attempt
my
life
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
murmured
something
about
a
jest
,
and
that
he
liked
a
bit
of
fun
;
and
*NL*
then
,
seeing
me
smile
,
changed
his
tone
,
and
assured
me
he
would
make
*NL*
all
clear
as
soon
as
we
had
breakfasted
.
I
saw
by
his
face
that
he
had
*NL*
no
lie
ready
for
me
,
though
he
was
hard
at
work
preparing
one
;
and
I
*NL*
think
I
was
about
to
tell
him
so
,
when
we
were
interrupted
by
a
knocking
*NL*
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bidding
my
uncle
sit
where
he
was
,
I
went
to
open
it
,
and
found
on
the
*NL*
doorstep
a
half-grown
boy
in
sea-clothes
.
He
had
no
sooner
seen
me
than
*NL*
he
began
to
dance
some
steps
of
the
sea-hornpipe
-LRB-
which
I
had
never
*NL*
before
heard
of
far
less
seen
-RRB-
,
snapping
his
fingers
in
the
air
and
*NL*
footing
it
right
cleverly
.
For
all
that
,
he
was
blue
with
the
cold
;
and
*NL*
there
was
something
in
his
face
,
a
look
between
tears
and
laughter
,
that
*NL*
was
highly
pathetic
and
consisted
ill
with
this
gaiety
of
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
cheer
,
mate
?
''
says
he
,
with
a
cracked
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
asked
him
soberly
to
name
his
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
pleasure
!
''
says
he
;
and
then
began
to
sing
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
it
's
my
delight
,
of
a
shiny
night
,
*NL*
In
the
season
of
the
year
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
I
,
``
if
you
have
no
business
at
all
,
I
will
even
be
so
*NL*
unmannerly
as
to
shut
you
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
,
brother
!
''
he
cried
.
``
Have
you
no
fun
about
you
?
or
do
you
want
*NL*
to
get
me
thrashed
?
I
've
brought
a
letter
from
old
Heasyoasy
to
Mr.
*NL*
Belflower
.
''
He
showed
me
a
letter
as
he
spoke
.
``
And
I
say
,
mate
,
''
he
*NL*
added
,
``
I
'm
mortal
hungry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
I
,
``
come
into
the
house
,
and
you
shall
have
a
bite
if
I
go
*NL*
empty
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
that
I
brought
him
in
and
set
him
down
to
my
own
place
,
where
he
*NL*
fell-to
greedily
on
the
remains
of
breakfast
,
winking
to
me
between
*NL*
whiles
,
and
making
many
faces
,
which
I
think
the
poor
soul
considered
*NL*
manly
.
Meanwhile
,
my
uncle
had
read
the
letter
and
sat
thinking
;
then
,
*NL*
suddenly
,
he
got
to
his
feet
with
a
great
air
of
liveliness
,
and
pulled
*NL*
me
apart
into
the
farthest
corner
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Read
that
,
''
said
he
,
and
put
the
letter
in
my
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
it
is
,
lying
before
me
as
I
write
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Hawes
Inn
,
at
the
Queen
's
Ferry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
--
I
lie
here
with
my
hawser
up
and
down
,
and
send
my
cabin-boy
to

informe
.
If
you
have
any
further
commands
for
over-seas
,
to-day
will
be
*NL*
the
last
occasion
,
as
the
wind
will
serve
us
well
out
of
the
firth
.
*NL*
I
will
not
seek
to
deny
that
I
have
had
crosses
with
your
doer
,
*
Mr.
*NL*
Rankeillor
;
of
which
,
if
not
speedily
redd
up
,
you
may
looke
to
see
some
*NL*
losses
follow
.
I
have
drawn
a
bill
upon
you
,
as
per
margin
,
and
am
,
sir
,
*NL*
your
most
obedt.

humble

``
ELIAS
HOSEASON

''
*
Agent

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
Davie
,
''
resumed
my
uncle
,
as
soon
as
he
saw
that
I
had
done
,
*NL*
``
I
have
a
venture
with
this
man
Hoseason
,
the
captain
of
a
trading
brig
,
*NL*
the
Covenant
,
of
Dysart
.
Now
,
if
you
and
me
was
to
walk
over
with
*NL*
yon
lad
,
I
could
see
the
captain
at
the
Hawes
,
or
maybe
on
board
the
*NL*
Covenant
if
there
was
papers
to
be
signed
;
and
so
far
from
a
loss
of
*NL*
time
,
we
can
jog
on
to
the
lawyer
,
Mr.
Rankeillor
's
.
After
a
'
that
's
*NL*
come
and
gone
,
ye
would
be
swier
*
to
believe
me
upon
my
naked
word
;
but
*NL*
ye
'll
believe
Rankeillor
.
He
's
factor
to
half
the
gentry
in
these
parts
;
*NL*
an
auld
man
,
forby
:
highly
respeckit
,
and
he
kenned
your
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*
Unwilling
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
stood
awhile
and
thought
.
I
was
going
to
some
place
of
shipping
,
which
*NL*
was
doubtless
populous
,
and
where
my
uncle
durst
attempt
no
violence
,
*NL*
and
,
indeed
,
even
the
society
of
the
cabin-boy
so
far
protected
me
.
Once
*NL*
there
,
I
believed
I
could
force
on
the
visit
to
the
lawyer
,
even
if
my
*NL*
uncle
were
now
insincere
in
proposing
it
;
and
,
perhaps
,
in
the
bottom
*NL*
of
my
heart
,
I
wished
a
nearer
view
of
the
sea
and
ships
.
You
are
to
*NL*
remember
I
had
lived
all
my
life
in
the
inland
hills
,
and
just
two
days
*NL*
before
had
my
first
sight
of
the
firth
lying
like
a
blue
floor
,
and
the
*NL*
sailed
ships
moving
on
the
face
of
it
,
no
bigger
than
toys
.
One
thing
*NL*
with
another
,
I
made
up
my
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
says
I
,
``
let
us
go
to
the
Ferry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
uncle
got
into
his
hat
and
coat
,
and
buckled
an
old
rusty
cutlass
on
;
*NL*
and
then
we
trod
the
fire
out
,
locked
the
door
,
and
set
forth
upon
our
*NL*
walk
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
wind
,
being
in
that
cold
quarter
the
north-west
,
blew
nearly
in
our
*NL*
faces
as
we
went
.
It
was
the
month
of
June
;
the
grass
was
all
white
with
*NL*
daisies
,
and
the
trees
with
blossom
;
but
,
to
judge
by
our
blue
nails
*NL*
and
aching
wrists
,
the
time
might
have
been
winter
and
the
whiteness
a
*NL*
December
frost
.
*NL*
*NL*
Uncle
Ebenezer
trudged
in
the
ditch
,
jogging
from
side
to
side
like
an
*NL*
old
ploughman
coming
home
from
work
.
He
never
said
a
word
the
whole
*NL*
way
;
and
I
was
thrown
for
talk
on
the
cabin-boy
.
He
told
me
his
name
was
*NL*
Ransome
,
and
that
he
had
followed
the
sea
since
he
was
nine
,
but
could
*NL*
not
say
how
old
he
was
,
as
he
had
lost
his
reckoning
.
He
showed
me
*NL*
tattoo
marks
,
baring
his
breast
in
the
teeth
of
the
wind
and
in
spite
*NL*
of
my
remonstrances
,
for
I
thought
it
was
enough
to
kill
him
;
he
swore
*NL*
horribly
whenever
he
remembered
,
but
more
like
a
silly
schoolboy
than
a
*NL*
man
;
and
boasted
of
many
wild
and
bad
things
that
he
had
done
:
stealthy
*NL*
thefts
,
false
accusations
,
ay
,
and
even
murder
;
but
all
with
such
a
*NL*
dearth
of
likelihood
in
the
details
,
and
such
a
weak
and
crazy
swagger
*NL*
in
the
delivery
,
as
disposed
me
rather
to
pity
than
to
believe
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
asked
him
of
the
brig
-LRB-
which
he
declared
was
the
finest
ship
that
*NL*
sailed
-RRB-
and
of
Captain
Hoseason
,
in
whose
praises
he
was
equally
loud
.
*NL*
Heasyoasy
-LRB-
for
so
he
still
named
the
skipper
-RRB-
was
a
man
,
by
his
account
,
*NL*
that
minded
for
nothing
either
in
heaven
or
earth
;
one
that
,
as
people
*NL*
said
,
would
``
crack
on
all
sail
into
the
day
of
judgment
;
''
rough
,
fierce
,
*NL*
unscrupulous
,
and
brutal
;
and
all
this
my
poor
cabin-boy
had
taught
*NL*
himself
to
admire
as
something
seamanlike
and
manly
.
He
would
only
admit
*NL*
one
flaw
in
his
idol
.
``
He
ai
n't
no
seaman
,
''
he
admitted
.
``
That
's
Mr.
*NL*
Shuan
that
navigates
the
brig
;
he
's
the
finest
seaman
in
the
trade
,
only
*NL*
for
drink
;
and
I
tell
you
I
believe
it
!
Why
,
look
`
ere
;
''
and
turning
down
*NL*
his
stocking
he
showed
me
a
great
,
raw
,
red
wound
that
made
my
blood
run
*NL*
cold
.
``
He
done
that
--
Mr.
Shuan
done
it
,
''
he
said
,
with
an
air
of
pride
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
I
cried
,
``
do
you
take
such
savage
usage
at
his
hands
?
Why
,
you
*NL*
are
no
slave
,
to
be
so
handled
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
the
poor
moon-calf
,
changing
his
tune
at
once
,
``
and
so
he
'll
*NL*
find
.
See'ere
;
''
and
he
showed
me
a
great
case-knife
,
which
he
told
me
*NL*
was
stolen
.
``
O
,
''
says
he
,
``
let
me
see
him
try
;
I
dare
him
to
;
I
'll
do
*NL*
for
him
!
O
,
he
ai
n't
the
first
!
''
And
he
confirmed
it
with
a
poor
,
silly
,
*NL*
ugly
oath
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
never
felt
such
pity
for
any
one
in
this
wide
world
as
I
felt
for
*NL*
that
half-witted
creature
,
and
it
began
to
come
over
me
that
the
brig
*NL*
Covenant
-LRB-
for
all
her
pious
name
-RRB-
was
little
better
than
a
hell
upon
the
*NL*
seas
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
no
friends
?
''
said
I
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
he
had
a
father
in
some
English
seaport
,
I
forget
which
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
a
fine
man
,
too
,
''
he
said
,
``
but
he
's
dead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
Heaven
's
name
,
''
cried
I
,
``
can
you
find
no
reputable
life
on
shore
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
no
,
''
says
he
,
winking
and
looking
very
sly
,
``
they
would
put
me
to
a
*NL*
trade
.
I
know
a
trick
worth
two
of
that
,
I
do
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
asked
him
what
trade
could
be
so
dreadful
as
the
one
he
followed
,
*NL*
where
he
ran
the
continual
peril
of
his
life
,
not
alone
from
wind
and
*NL*
sea
,
but
by
the
horrid
cruelty
of
those
who
were
his
masters
.
He
said
*NL*
it
was
very
true
;
and
then
began
to
praise
the
life
,
and
tell
what
a
*NL*
pleasure
it
was
to
get
on
shore
with
money
in
his
pocket
,
and
spend
it
*NL*
like
a
man
,
and
buy
apples
,
and
swagger
,
and
surprise
what
he
called
*NL*
stick-in-the-mud
boys
.
``
And
then
it
's
not
all
as
bad
as
that
,
''
says
he
;
*NL*
``
there
's
worse
off
than
me
:
there
's
the
twenty-pounders
.
O
,
laws
!
*NL*
you
should
see
them
taking
on
.
Why
,
I
've
seen
a
man
as
old
as
you
,
I
*NL*
dessay
''
--
-LRB-
to
him
I
seemed
old
-RRB-
--
``
ah
,
and
he
had
a
beard
,
too
--
well
,
and
*NL*
as
soon
as
we
cleared
out
of
the
river
,
and
he
had
the
drug
out
of
his
*NL*
head
--
my
!
how
he
cried
and
carried
on
!
I
made
a
fine
fool
of
him
,
I
tell
*NL*
you
!
And
then
there
's
little
uns
,
too
:
oh
,
little
by
me
!
I
tell
you
,
I
*NL*
keep
them
in
order
.
When
we
carry
little
uns
,
I
have
a
rope
's
end
of
*NL*
my
own
to
wollop
'em
.
''
And
so
he
ran
on
,
until
it
came
in
on
me
what
*NL*
he
meant
by
twenty-pounders
were
those
unhappy
criminals
who
were
*NL*
sent
over-seas
to
slavery
in
North
America
,
or
the
still
more
unhappy
*NL*
innocents
who
were
kidnapped
or
trepanned
-LRB-
as
the
word
went
-RRB-
for
private
*NL*
interest
or
vengeance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
then
we
came
to
the
top
of
the
hill
,
and
looked
down
on
the
Ferry
*NL*
and
the
Hope
.
The
Firth
of
Forth
-LRB-
as
is
very
well
known
-RRB-
narrows
at
this
*NL*
point
to
the
width
of
a
good-sized
river
,
which
makes
a
convenient
ferry
*NL*
going
north
,
and
turns
the
upper
reach
into
a
landlocked
haven
for
all
*NL*
manner
of
ships
.
Right
in
the
midst
of
the
narrows
lies
an
islet
with
*NL*
some
ruins
;
on
the
south
shore
they
have
built
a
pier
for
the
service
*NL*
of
the
Ferry
;
and
at
the
end
of
the
pier
,
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
,
*NL*
and
backed
against
a
pretty
garden
of
holly-trees
and
hawthorns
,
I
could
*NL*
see
the
building
which
they
called
the
Hawes
Inn
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
town
of
Queensferry
lies
farther
west
,
and
the
neighbourhood
of
the
*NL*
inn
looked
pretty
lonely
at
that
time
of
day
,
for
the
boat
had
just
gone
*NL*
north
with
passengers
.
A
skiff
,
however
,
lay
beside
the
pier
,
with
some
*NL*
seamen
sleeping
on
the
thwarts
;
this
,
as
Ransome
told
me
,
was
the
brig
's
*NL*
boat
waiting
for
the
captain
;
and
about
half
a
mile
off
,
and
all
*NL*
alone
in
the
anchorage
,
he
showed
me
the
Covenant
herself
.
There
was
a
*NL*
sea-going
bustle
on
board
;
yards
were
swinging
into
place
;
and
as
the
*NL*
wind
blew
from
that
quarter
,
I
could
hear
the
song
of
the
sailors
as
*NL*
they
pulled
upon
the
ropes
.
After
all
I
had
listened
to
upon
the
way
,
I
*NL*
looked
at
that
ship
with
an
extreme
abhorrence
;
and
from
the
bottom
of
*NL*
my
heart
I
pitied
all
poor
souls
that
were
condemned
to
sail
in
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
all
three
pulled
up
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
;
and
now
I
marched
*NL*
across
the
road
and
addressed
my
uncle
.
``
I
think
it
right
to
tell
*NL*
you
,
sir
,
''
says
I
,
``
there
's
nothing
that
will
bring
me
on
board
that
*NL*
Covenant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
seemed
to
waken
from
a
dream
.
``
Eh
?
''
he
said
.
``
What
's
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
over
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
''
he
said
,
``
we
'll
have
to
please
ye
,
I
suppose
.
But
what
*NL*
are
we
standing
here
for
?
It
's
perishing
cold
;
and
if
I
'm
no
mistaken
,
*NL*
they
're
busking
the
Covenant
for
sea
.

CHAPTER
VI
*NL*
*NL*
WHAT
BEFELL
AT
THE
QUEEN
'S
FERRY
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
we
came
to
the
inn
,
Ransome
led
us
up
the
stair
to
a
small
*NL*
room
,
with
a
bed
in
it
,
and
heated
like
an
oven
by
a
great
fire
of
coal
.
*NL*
At
a
table
hard
by
the
chimney
,
a
tall
,
dark
,
sober-looking
man
sat
*NL*
writing
.
In
spite
of
the
heat
of
the
room
,
he
wore
a
thick
sea-jacket
,
*NL*
buttoned
to
the
neck
,
and
a
tall
hairy
cap
drawn
down
over
his
ears
;
yet
*NL*
I
never
saw
any
man
,
not
even
a
judge
upon
the
bench
,
look
cooler
,
or
*NL*
more
studious
and
self-possessed
,
than
this
ship-captain
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
got
to
his
feet
at
once
,
and
coming
forward
,
offered
his
large
hand
*NL*
to
Ebenezer
.
``
I
am
proud
to
see
you
,
Mr.
Balfour
,
''
said
he
,
in
a
fine
*NL*
deep
voice
,
``
and
glad
that
ye
are
here
in
time
.
The
wind
's
fair
,
and
the
*NL*
tide
upon
the
turn
;
we
'll
see
the
old
coal-bucket
burning
on
the
Isle
of
*NL*
May
before
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Captain
Hoseason
,
''
returned
my
uncle
,
``
you
keep
your
room
unco
hot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
habit
I
have
,
Mr.
Balfour
,
''
said
the
skipper
.
``
I
'm
a
cold-rife
*NL*
man
by
my
nature
;
I
have
a
cold
blood
,
sir
.
There
's
neither
fur
,
*NL*
nor
flannel
--
no
,
sir
,
nor
hot
rum
,
will
warm
up
what
they
call
*NL*
the
temperature
.
Sir
,
it
's
the
same
with
most
men
that
have
been
*NL*
carbonadoed
,
as
they
call
it
,
in
the
tropic
seas
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
captain
,
''
replied
my
uncle
,
``
we
must
all
be
the
way
we
're
*NL*
made
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
chanced
that
this
fancy
of
the
captain
's
had
a
great
share
in
my
*NL*
misfortunes
.
For
though
I
had
promised
myself
not
to
let
my
kinsman
out
*NL*
of
sight
,
I
was
both
so
impatient
for
a
nearer
look
of
the
sea
,
and
*NL*
so
sickened
by
the
closeness
of
the
room
,
that
when
he
told
me
to
``
run
*NL*
down-stairs
and
play
myself
awhile
,
''
I
was
fool
enough
to
take
him
at
*NL*
his
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
Away
I
went
,
therefore
,
leaving
the
two
men
sitting
down
to
a
bottle
*NL*
and
a
great
mass
of
papers
;
and
crossing
the
road
in
front
of
the
inn
,
*NL*
walked
down
upon
the
beach
.
With
the
wind
in
that
quarter
,
only
little
*NL*
wavelets
,
not
much
bigger
than
I
had
seen
upon
a
lake
,
beat
upon
the
*NL*
shore
.
But
the
weeds
were
new
to
me
--
some
green
,
some
brown
and
long
,
*NL*
and
some
with
little
bladders
that
crackled
between
my
fingers
.
Even
so
*NL*
far
up
the
firth
,
the
smell
of
the
sea-water
was
exceedingly
salt
and
*NL*
stirring
;
the
Covenant
,
besides
,
was
beginning
to
shake
out
her
sails
,
*NL*
which
hung
upon
the
yards
in
clusters
;
and
the
spirit
of
all
that
I
*NL*
beheld
put
me
in
thoughts
of
far
voyages
and
foreign
places
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
looked
,
too
,
at
the
seamen
with
the
skiff
--
big
brown
fellows
,
some
in
*NL*
shirts
,
some
with
jackets
,
some
with
coloured
handkerchiefs
about
their
*NL*
throats
,
one
with
a
brace
of
pistols
stuck
into
his
pockets
,
two
or
*NL*
three
with
knotty
bludgeons
,
and
all
with
their
case-knives
.
I
passed
*NL*
the
time
of
day
with
one
that
looked
less
desperate
than
his
fellows
,
*NL*
and
asked
him
of
the
sailing
of
the
brig.
He
said
they
would
get
under
*NL*
way
as
soon
as
the
ebb
set
,
and
expressed
his
gladness
to
be
out
of
*NL*
a
port
where
there
were
no
taverns
and
fiddlers
;
but
all
with
such
*NL*
horrifying
oaths
,
that
I
made
haste
to
get
away
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
threw
me
back
on
Ransome
,
who
seemed
the
least
wicked
of
that
gang
,
*NL*
and
who
soon
came
out
of
the
inn
and
ran
to
me
,
crying
for
a
bowl
of
*NL*
punch
.
I
told
him
I
would
give
him
no
such
thing
,
for
neither
he
nor
I
*NL*
was
of
an
age
for
such
indulgences
.
``
But
a
glass
of
ale
you
may
have
,
*NL*
and
welcome
,
''
said
I
.
He
mopped
and
mowed
at
me
,
and
called
me
names
;
*NL*
but
he
was
glad
to
get
the
ale
,
for
all
that
;
and
presently
we
were
*NL*
set
down
at
a
table
in
the
front
room
of
the
inn
,
and
both
eating
and
*NL*
drinking
with
a
good
appetite
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
it
occurred
to
me
that
,
as
the
landlord
was
a
man
of
that
county
,
*NL*
I
might
do
well
to
make
a
friend
of
him
.
I
offered
him
a
share
,
as
was
*NL*
much
the
custom
in
those
days
;
but
he
was
far
too
great
a
man
to
sit
*NL*
with
such
poor
customers
as
Ransome
and
myself
,
and
he
was
leaving
the
*NL*
room
,
when
I
called
him
back
to
ask
if
he
knew
Mr.
Rankeillor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hoot
,
ay
,
''
says
he
,
``
and
a
very
honest
man
.
And
,
O
,
by-the-by
,
''
says
*NL*
he
,
``
was
it
you
that
came
in
with
Ebenezer
?
''
And
when
I
had
told
him
*NL*
yes
,
``
Ye
'll
be
no
friend
of
his
?
''
he
asked
,
meaning
,
in
the
Scottish
*NL*
way
,
that
I
would
be
no
relative
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
no
,
none
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
not
,
''
said
he
,
``
and
yet
ye
have
a
kind
of
gliff
*
of
Mr.
*NL*
Alexander
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*
Look
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
it
seemed
that
Ebenezer
was
ill-seen
in
the
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nae
doubt
,
''
said
the
landlord
.
``
He
's
a
wicked
auld
man
,
and
there
's
*NL*
many
would
like
to
see
him
girning
in
the
tow

Jennet
Clouston
and
mony
*NL*
mair
that
he
has
harried
out
of
house
and
hame
.
And
yet
he
was
ance
*NL*
a
fine
young
fellow
,
too
.
But
that
was
before
the
sough
**
gaed
abroad
*NL*
about
Mr.
Alexander
,
that
was
like
the
death
of
him

Report
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
was
it
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ou
,
just
that
he
had
killed
him
,
''
said
the
landlord
.
``
Did
ye
never
hear
*NL*
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
would
he
kill
him
for
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
for
,
but
just
to
get
the
place
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
place
?
''
said
I.
``
The
Shaws
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nae
other
place
that
I
ken
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
man
?
''
said
I.
``
Is
that
so
?
Was
my
--
was
Alexander
the
eldest
son
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Deed
was
he
,
''
said
the
landlord
.
``
What
else
would
he
have
killed
him
*NL*
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
with
that
he
went
away
,
as
he
had
been
impatient
to
do
from
the
*NL*
beginning
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
,
I
had
guessed
it
a
long
while
ago
;
but
it
is
one
thing
to
*NL*
guess
,
another
to
know
;
and
I
sat
stunned
with
my
good
fortune
,
and
*NL*
could
scarce
grow
to
believe
that
the
same
poor
lad
who
had
trudged
in
*NL*
the
dust
from
Ettrick
Forest
not
two
days
ago
,
was
now
one
of
the
rich
*NL*
of
the
earth
,
and
had
a
house
and
broad
lands
,
and
might
mount
his
horse
*NL*
tomorrow
.
All
these
pleasant
things
,
and
a
thousand
others
,
crowded
into
*NL*
my
mind
,
as
I
sat
staring
before
me
out
of
the
inn
window
,
and
paying
*NL*
no
heed
to
what
I
saw
;
only
I
remember
that
my
eye
lighted
on
Captain
*NL*
Hoseason
down
on
the
pier
among
his
seamen
,
and
speaking
with
some
*NL*
authority
.
And
presently
he
came
marching
back
towards
the
house
,
with
*NL*
no
mark
of
a
sailor
's
clumsiness
,
but
carrying
his
fine
,
tall
figure
*NL*
with
a
manly
bearing
,
and
still
with
the
same
sober
,
grave
expression
on
*NL*
his
face
.
I
wondered
if
it
was
possible
that
Ransome
's
stories
could
*NL*
be
true
,
and
half
disbelieved
them
;
they
fitted
so
ill
with
the
man
's
*NL*
looks
.
But
indeed
,
he
was
neither
so
good
as
I
supposed
him
,
nor
quite
*NL*
so
bad
as
Ransome
did
;
for
,
in
fact
,
he
was
two
men
,
and
left
the
better
*NL*
one
behind
as
soon
as
he
set
foot
on
board
his
vessel
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
thing
,
I
heard
my
uncle
calling
me
,
and
found
the
pair
in
the
*NL*
road
together
.
It
was
the
captain
who
addressed
me
,
and
that
with
an
air
*NL*
-LRB-
very
flattering
to
a
young
lad
-RRB-
of
grave
equality
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
said
he
,
``
Mr.
Balfour
tells
me
great
things
of
you
;
and
for
my
*NL*
own
part
,
I
like
your
looks
.
I
wish
I
was
for
longer
here
,
that
we
might
*NL*
make
the
better
friends
;
but
we
'll
make
the
most
of
what
we
have
.
Ye
*NL*
shall
come
on
board
my
brig
for
half
an
hour
,
till
the
ebb
sets
,
and
*NL*
drink
a
bowl
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
I
longed
to
see
the
inside
of
a
ship
more
than
words
can
tell
;
but
*NL*
I
was
not
going
to
put
myself
in
jeopardy
,
and
I
told
him
my
uncle
and
I
*NL*
had
an
appointment
with
a
lawyer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
ay
,
''
said
he
,
``
he
passed
me
word
of
that
.
But
,
ye
see
,
the
boat
'll
*NL*
set
ye
ashore
at
the
town
pier
,
and
that
's
but
a
penny
stonecast
from
*NL*
Rankeillor
's
house
.
''
And
here
he
suddenly
leaned
down
and
whispered
in
*NL*
my
ear
:
``
Take
care
of
the
old
tod
;
*
he
means
mischief
.
Come
aboard
till
*NL*
I
can
get
a
word
with
ye
.
''
And
then
,
passing
his
arm
through
mine
,
he
*NL*
continued
aloud
,
as
he
set
off
towards
his
boat
:
``
But
,
come
,
what
can
I
*NL*
bring
ye
from
the
Carolinas
?
Any
friend
of
Mr.
Balfour
's
can
command
.
*NL*
A
roll
of
tobacco
?
Indian
feather-work
?
a
skin
of
a
wild
beast
?
a
stone
*NL*
pipe
?
the
mocking-bird
that
mews
for
all
the
world
like
a
cat
?
the
*NL*
cardinal
bird
that
is
as
red
as
blood
?
--
take
your
pick
and
say
your
*NL*
pleasure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*
Fox
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
we
were
at
the
boat-side
,
and
he
was
handing
me
in
.
I
did
*NL*
not
dream
of
hanging
back
;
I
thought
-LRB-
the
poor
fool
!
-RRB-
that
I
had
found
*NL*
a
good
friend
and
helper
,
and
I
was
rejoiced
to
see
the
ship
.
As
soon
as
*NL*
we
were
all
set
in
our
places
,
the
boat
was
thrust
off
from
the
pier
*NL*
and
began
to
move
over
the
waters
:
and
what
with
my
pleasure
in
this
new
*NL*
movement
and
my
surprise
at
our
low
position
,
and
the
appearance
of
the
*NL*
shores
,
and
the
growing
bigness
of
the
brig
as
we
drew
near
to
it
,
I
*NL*
could
hardly
understand
what
the
captain
said
,
and
must
have
answered
*NL*
him
at
random
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
we
were
alongside
-LRB-
where
I
sat
fairly
gaping
at
the
ship
's
*NL*
height
,
the
strong
humming
of
the
tide
against
its
sides
,
and
the
*NL*
pleasant
cries
of
the
seamen
at
their
work
-RRB-
Hoseason
,
declaring
that
he
*NL*
and
I
must
be
the
first
aboard
,
ordered
a
tackle
to
be
sent
down
from
*NL*
the
main-yard
.
In
this
I
was
whipped
into
the
air
and
set
down
again
on
*NL*
the
deck
,
where
the
captain
stood
ready
waiting
for
me
,
and
instantly
*NL*
slipped
back
his
arm
under
mine
.
There
I
stood
some
while
,
a
little
*NL*
dizzy
with
the
unsteadiness
of
all
around
me
,
perhaps
a
little
afraid
,
*NL*
and
yet
vastly
pleased
with
these
strange
sights
;
the
captain
meanwhile
*NL*
pointing
out
the
strangest
,
and
telling
me
their
names
and
uses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
where
is
my
uncle
?
''
said
I
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
''
said
Hoseason
,
with
a
sudden
grimness
,
``
that
's
the
point
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
I
was
lost
.
With
all
my
strength
,
I
plucked
myself
clear
of
him
*NL*
and
ran
to
the
bulwarks
.
Sure
enough
,
there
was
the
boat
pulling
for
the
*NL*
town
,
with
my
uncle
sitting
in
the
stern
.
I
gave
a
piercing
cry
--
``
Help
,
*NL*
help
!
Murder
!
''
--
so
that
both
sides
of
the
anchorage
rang
with
it
,
and
*NL*
my
uncle
turned
round
where
he
was
sitting
,
and
showed
me
a
face
full
of
*NL*
cruelty
and
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
last
I
saw
.
Already
strong
hands
had
been
plucking
me
back
*NL*
from
the
ship
's
side
;
and
now
a
thunderbolt
seemed
to
strike
me
;
I
saw
a
*NL*
great
flash
of
fire
,
and
fell
senseless
.

CHAPTER
VII
*NL*
*NL*
I
GO
TO
SEA
IN
THE
BRIG
``
COVENANT
''
OF
DYSART
*NL*
*NL*
I
came
to
myself
in
darkness
,
in
great
pain
,
bound
hand
and
foot
,
and
*NL*
deafened
by
many
unfamiliar
noises
.
There
sounded
in
my
ears
a
roaring
*NL*
of
water
as
of
a
huge
mill-dam
,
the
thrashing
of
heavy
sprays
,
the
*NL*
thundering
of
the
sails
,
and
the
shrill
cries
of
seamen
.
The
whole
world
*NL*
now
heaved
giddily
up
,
and
now
rushed
giddily
downward
;
and
so
sick
and
*NL*
hurt
was
I
in
body
,
and
my
mind
so
much
confounded
,
that
it
took
me
a
*NL*
long
while
,
chasing
my
thoughts
up
and
down
,
and
ever
stunned
again
by
*NL*
a
fresh
stab
of
pain
,
to
realise
that
I
must
be
lying
somewhere
bound
in
*NL*
the
belly
of
that
unlucky
ship
,
and
that
the
wind
must
have
strengthened
*NL*
to
a
gale
.
With
the
clear
perception
of
my
plight
,
there
fell
upon
me
a
*NL*
blackness
of
despair
,
a
horror
of
remorse
at
my
own
folly
,
and
a
passion
*NL*
of
anger
at
my
uncle
,
that
once
more
bereft
me
of
my
senses
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
returned
again
to
life
,
the
same
uproar
,
the
same
confused
and
*NL*
violent
movements
,
shook
and
deafened
me
;
and
presently
,
to
my
other
*NL*
pains
and
distresses
,
there
was
added
the
sickness
of
an
unused
landsman
*NL*
on
the
sea
.
In
that
time
of
my
adventurous
youth
,
I
suffered
many
*NL*
hardships
;
but
none
that
was
so
crushing
to
my
mind
and
body
,
or
lit
by
*NL*
so
few
hopes
,
as
these
first
hours
aboard
the
brig.
*NL*
*NL*
I
heard
a
gun
fire
,
and
supposed
the
storm
had
proved
too
strong
for
us
,
*NL*
and
we
were
firing
signals
of
distress
.
The
thought
of
deliverance
,
even
*NL*
by
death
in
the
deep
sea
,
was
welcome
to
me
.
Yet
it
was
no
such
matter
;
*NL*
but
-LRB-
as
I
was
afterwards
told
-RRB-
a
common
habit
of
the
captain
's
,
which
*NL*
I
here
set
down
to
show
that
even
the
worst
man
may
have
his
kindlier
*NL*
side
.
We
were
then
passing
,
it
appeared
,
within
some
miles
of
Dysart
,
*NL*
where
the
brig
was
built
,
and
where
old
Mrs.
Hoseason
,
the
captain
's
*NL*
mother
,
had
come
some
years
before
to
live
;
and
whether
outward
or
*NL*
inward
bound
,
the
Covenant
was
never
suffered
to
go
by
that
place
by
*NL*
day
,
without
a
gun
fired
and
colours
shown
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
no
measure
of
time
;
day
and
night
were
alike
in
that
ill-smelling
*NL*
cavern
of
the
ship
's
bowels
where
I
lay
;
and
the
misery
of
my
situation
*NL*
drew
out
the
hours
to
double
.
How
long
,
therefore
,
I
lay
waiting
to
hear
*NL*
the
ship
split
upon
some
rock
,
or
to
feel
her
reel
head
foremost
into
*NL*
the
depths
of
the
sea
,
I
have
not
the
means
of
computation
.
But
sleep
at
*NL*
length
stole
from
me
the
consciousness
of
sorrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
awakened
by
the
light
of
a
hand-lantern
shining
in
my
face
.
A
*NL*
small
man
of
about
thirty
,
with
green
eyes
and
a
tangle
of
fair
hair
,
*NL*
stood
looking
down
at
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
he
,
``
how
goes
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
answered
by
a
sob
;
and
my
visitor
then
felt
my
pulse
and
temples
,
and
*NL*
set
himself
to
wash
and
dress
the
wound
upon
my
scalp
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
''
said
he
,
``
a
sore
dunt
*
.
What
,
man
?
Cheer
up
!
The
world
's
no
done
;
*NL*
you
've
made
a
bad
start
of
it
but
you
'll
make
a
better
.
Have
you
had
any
*NL*
meat
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
*
Stroke
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
I
could
not
look
at
it
:
and
thereupon
he
gave
me
some
brandy
and
*NL*
water
in
a
tin
pannikin
,
and
left
me
once
more
to
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
time
he
came
to
see
me
,
I
was
lying
betwixt
sleep
and
waking
,
*NL*
my
eyes
wide
open
in
the
darkness
,
the
sickness
quite
departed
,
but
*NL*
succeeded
by
a
horrid
giddiness
and
swimming
that
was
almost
worse
*NL*
to
bear
.
I
ached
,
besides
,
in
every
limb
,
and
the
cords
that
bound
me
*NL*
seemed
to
be
of
fire
.
The
smell
of
the
hole
in
which
I
lay
seemed
to
*NL*
have
become
a
part
of
me
;
and
during
the
long
interval
since
his
last
*NL*
visit
I
had
suffered
tortures
of
fear
,
now
from
the
scurrying
of
the
*NL*
ship
's
rats
,
that
sometimes
pattered
on
my
very
face
,
and
now
from
the
*NL*
dismal
imaginings
that
haunt
the
bed
of
fever
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
glimmer
of
the
lantern
,
as
a
trap
opened
,
shone
in
like
the
heaven
's
*NL*
sunlight
;
and
though
it
only
showed
me
the
strong
,
dark
beams
of
the
*NL*
ship
that
was
my
prison
,
I
could
have
cried
aloud
for
gladness
.
The
man
*NL*
with
the
green
eyes
was
the
first
to
descend
the
ladder
,
and
I
noticed
*NL*
that
he
came
somewhat
unsteadily
.
He
was
followed
by
the
captain
.
*NL*
Neither
said
a
word
;
but
the
first
set
to
and
examined
me
,
and
dressed
*NL*
my
wound
as
before
,
while
Hoseason
looked
me
in
my
face
with
an
odd
,
*NL*
black
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
sir
,
you
see
for
yourself
,
''
said
the
first
:
``
a
high
fever
,
no
*NL*
appetite
,
no
light
,
no
meat
:
you
see
for
yourself
what
that
means
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
no
conjurer
,
Mr.
Riach
,
''
said
the
captain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
me
leave
,
sir
,
''
said
Riach
;
``
you
've
a
good
head
upon
your
*NL*
shoulders
,
and
a
good
Scotch
tongue
to
ask
with
;
but
I
will
leave
you
no
*NL*
manner
of
excuse
;
I
want
that
boy
taken
out
of
this
hole
and
put
in
the
*NL*
forecastle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
ye
may
want
,
sir
,
is
a
matter
of
concern
to
nobody
but
yoursel
'
,
''
*NL*
returned
the
captain
;
``
but
I
can
tell
ye
that
which
is
to
be
.
Here
he
*NL*
is
;
here
he
shall
bide
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Admitting
that
you
have
been
paid
in
a
proportion
,
''
said
the
other
,
``
I
*NL*
will
crave
leave
humbly
to
say
that
I
have
not
.
Paid
I
am
,
and
none
too
*NL*
much
,
to
be
the
second
officer
of
this
old
tub
,
and
you
ken
very
well
if
*NL*
I
do
my
best
to
earn
it
.
But
I
was
paid
for
nothing
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
ye
could
hold
back
your
hand
from
the
tin-pan
,
Mr.
Riach
,
I
would
*NL*
have
no
complaint
to
make
of
ye
,
''
returned
the
skipper
;
``
and
instead
*NL*
of
asking
riddles
,
I
make
bold
to
say
that
ye
would
keep
your
breath
to
*NL*
cool
your
porridge
.
We
'll
be
required
on
deck
,
''
he
added
,
in
a
sharper
*NL*
note
,
and
set
one
foot
upon
the
ladder
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Mr.
Riach
caught
him
by
the
sleeve
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Admitting
that
you
have
been
paid
to
do
a
murder
--
''
he
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hoseason
turned
upon
him
with
a
flash
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
that
?
''
he
cried
.
``
What
kind
of
talk
is
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
it
is
the
talk
that
you
can
understand
,
''
said
Mr.
Riach
,
*NL*
looking
him
steadily
in
the
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Riach
,
I
have
sailed
with
ye
three
cruises
,
''
replied
the
captain
.
*NL*
``
In
all
that
time
,
sir
,
ye
should
have
learned
to
know
me
:
I
'm
a
stiff
*NL*
man
,
and
a
dour
man
;
but
for
what
ye
say
the
now
--
fie
,
fie
!
--
it
comes
*NL*
from
a
bad
heart
and
a
black
conscience
.
If
ye
say
the
lad
will
die
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
will
he
!
''
said
Mr.
Riach
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
is
not
that
enough
?
''
said
Hoseason
.
``
Flit
him
where
ye
*NL*
please
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thereupon
the
captain
ascended
the
ladder
;
and
I
,
who
had
lain
silent
*NL*
throughout
this
strange
conversation
,
beheld
Mr.
Riach
turn
after
him
*NL*
and
bow
as
low
as
to
his
knees
in
what
was
plainly
a
spirit
of
derision
.
*NL*
Even
in
my
then
state
of
sickness
,
I
perceived
two
things
:
that
the
*NL*
mate
was
touched
with
liquor
,
as
the
captain
hinted
,
and
that
-LRB-
drunk
or
*NL*
sober
-RRB-
he
was
like
to
prove
a
valuable
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
Five
minutes
afterwards
my
bonds
were
cut
,
I
was
hoisted
on
a
man
's
*NL*
back
,
carried
up
to
the
forecastle
,
and
laid
in
a
bunk
on
some
*NL*
sea-blankets
;
where
the
first
thing
that
I
did
was
to
lose
my
senses
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
blessed
thing
indeed
to
open
my
eyes
again
upon
the
daylight
,
*NL*
and
to
find
myself
in
the
society
of
men
.
The
forecastle
was
a
roomy
*NL*
place
enough
,
set
all
about
with
berths
,
in
which
the
men
of
the
watch
*NL*
below
were
seated
smoking
,
or
lying
down
asleep
.
The
day
being
calm
and
*NL*
the
wind
fair
,
the
scuttle
was
open
,
and
not
only
the
good
daylight
,
but
*NL*
from
time
to
time
-LRB-
as
the
ship
rolled
-RRB-
a
dusty
beam
of
sunlight
shone
*NL*
in
,
and
dazzled
and
delighted
me
.
I
had
no
sooner
moved
,
moreover
,
than
*NL*
one
of
the
men
brought
me
a
drink
of
something
healing
which
Mr.
Riach
*NL*
had
prepared
,
and
bade
me
lie
still
and
I
should
soon
be
well
again
.
*NL*
There
were
no
bones
broken
,
he
explained
:
``
A
clour
*
on
the
head
was
*NL*
naething
.
Man
,
''
said
he
,
``
it
was
me
that
gave
it
ye
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*
Blow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
I
lay
for
the
space
of
many
days
a
close
prisoner
,
and
not
only
got
*NL*
my
health
again
,
but
came
to
know
my
companions
.
They
were
a
rough
lot
*NL*
indeed
,
as
sailors
mostly
are
:
being
men
rooted
out
of
all
the
kindly
*NL*
parts
of
life
,
and
condemned
to
toss
together
on
the
rough
seas
,
with
*NL*
masters
no
less
cruel
.
There
were
some
among
them
that
had
sailed
with
*NL*
the
pirates
and
seen
things
it
would
be
a
shame
even
to
speak
of
;
some
*NL*
were
men
that
had
run
from
the
king
's
ships
,
and
went
with
a
halter
*NL*
round
their
necks
,
of
which
they
made
no
secret
;
and
all
,
as
the
saying
*NL*
goes
,
were
``
at
a
word
and
a
blow
''
with
their
best
friends
.
Yet
I
had
*NL*
not
been
many
days
shut
up
with
them
before
I
began
to
be
ashamed
of
my
*NL*
first
judgment
,
when
I
had
drawn
away
from
them
at
the
Ferry
pier
,
as
*NL*
though
they
had
been
unclean
beasts
.
No
class
of
man
is
altogether
bad
,
*NL*
but
each
has
its
own
faults
and
virtues
;
and
these
shipmates
of
mine
*NL*
were
no
exception
to
the
rule
.
Rough
they
were
,
sure
enough
;
and
bad
,
I
*NL*
suppose
;
but
they
had
many
virtues
.
They
were
kind
when
it
occurred
to
*NL*
them
,
simple
even
beyond
the
simplicity
of
a
country
lad
like
me
,
and
*NL*
had
some
glimmerings
of
honesty
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
one
man
,
of
maybe
forty
,
that
would
sit
on
my
berthside
for
*NL*
hours
and
tell
me
of
his
wife
and
child
.
He
was
a
fisher
that
had
lost
*NL*
his
boat
,
and
thus
been
driven
to
the
deep-sea
voyaging
.
Well
,
it
is
*NL*
years
ago
now
:
but
I
have
never
forgotten
him
.
His
wife
-LRB-
who
was
``
young
*NL*
by
him
,
''
as
he
often
told
me
-RRB-
waited
in
vain
to
see
her
man
return
;
he
*NL*
would
never
again
make
the
fire
for
her
in
the
morning
,
nor
yet
keep
*NL*
the
bairn
when
she
was
sick
.
Indeed
,
many
of
these
poor
fellows
-LRB-
as
the
*NL*
event
proved
-RRB-
were
upon
their
last
cruise
;
the
deep
seas
and
cannibal
*NL*
fish
received
them
;
and
it
is
a
thankless
business
to
speak
ill
of
the
*NL*
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
other
good
deeds
that
they
did
,
they
returned
my
money
,
which
had
*NL*
been
shared
among
them
;
and
though
it
was
about
a
third
short
,
I
was
*NL*
very
glad
to
get
it
,
and
hoped
great
good
from
it
in
the
land
I
was
*NL*
going
to
.
The
ship
was
bound
for
the
Carolinas
;
and
you
must
not
suppose
*NL*
that
I
was
going
to
that
place
merely
as
an
exile
.
The
trade
was
even
*NL*
then
much
depressed
;
since
that
,
and
with
the
rebellion
of
the
colonies
*NL*
and
the
formation
of
the
United
States
,
it
has
,
of
course
,
come
to
*NL*
an
end
;
but
in
those
days
of
my
youth
,
white
men
were
still
sold
into
*NL*
slavery
on
the
plantations
,
and
that
was
the
destiny
to
which
my
wicked
*NL*
uncle
had
condemned
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cabin-boy
Ransome
-LRB-
from
whom
I
had
first
heard
of
these
atrocities
-RRB-
*NL*
came
in
at
times
from
the
round-house
,
where
he
berthed
and
served
,
now
*NL*
nursing
a
bruised
limb
in
silent
agony
,
now
raving
against
the
cruelty
*NL*
of
Mr.
Shuan
.
It
made
my
heart
bleed
;
but
the
men
had
a
great
respect
*NL*
for
the
chief
mate
,
who
was
,
as
they
said
,
``
the
only
seaman
of
the
whole
*NL*
jing-bang
,
and
none
such
a
bad
man
when
he
was
sober
.
''
Indeed
,
I
found
*NL*
there
was
a
strange
peculiarity
about
our
two
mates
:
that
Mr.
Riach
was
*NL*
sullen
,
unkind
,
and
harsh
when
he
was
sober
,
and
Mr.
Shuan
would
not
*NL*
hurt
a
fly
except
when
he
was
drinking
.
I
asked
about
the
captain
;
but
I
*NL*
was
told
drink
made
no
difference
upon
that
man
of
iron
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
my
best
in
the
small
time
allowed
me
to
make
some
thing
like
a
*NL*
man
,
or
rather
I
should
say
something
like
a
boy
,
of
the
poor
creature
,
*NL*
Ransome
.
But
his
mind
was
scarce
truly
human
.
He
could
remember
nothing
*NL*
of
the
time
before
he
came
to
sea
;
only
that
his
father
had
made
clocks
,
*NL*
and
had
a
starling
in
the
parlour
,
which
could
whistle
``
The
North
*NL*
Countrie
;
''
all
else
had
been
blotted
out
in
these
years
of
hardship
*NL*
and
cruelties
.
He
had
a
strange
notion
of
the
dry
land
,
picked
up
from
*NL*
sailor
's
stories
:
that
it
was
a
place
where
lads
were
put
to
some
kind
*NL*
of
slavery
called
a
trade
,
and
where
apprentices
were
continually
lashed
*NL*
and
clapped
into
foul
prisons
.
In
a
town
,
he
thought
every
second
person
*NL*
a
decoy
,
and
every
third
house
a
place
in
which
seamen
would
be
drugged
*NL*
and
murdered
.
To
be
sure
,
I
would
tell
him
how
kindly
I
had
myself
been
*NL*
used
upon
that
dry
land
he
was
so
much
afraid
of
,
and
how
well
fed
and
*NL*
carefully
taught
both
by
my
friends
and
my
parents
:
and
if
he
had
been
*NL*
recently
hurt
,
he
would
weep
bitterly
and
swear
to
run
away
;
but
if
*NL*
he
was
in
his
usual
crackbrain
humour
,
or
-LRB-
still
more
-RRB-
if
he
had
had
a
*NL*
glass
of
spirits
in
the
roundhouse
,
he
would
deride
the
notion
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Mr.
Riach
-LRB-
Heaven
forgive
him
!
-RRB-
who
gave
the
boy
drink
;
and
*NL*
it
was
,
doubtless
,
kindly
meant
;
but
besides
that
it
was
ruin
to
his
*NL*
health
,
it
was
the
pitifullest
thing
in
life
to
see
this
unhappy
,
*NL*
unfriended
creature
staggering
,
and
dancing
,
and
talking
he
knew
not
*NL*
what
.
Some
of
the
men
laughed
,
but
not
all
;
others
would
grow
as
black
*NL*
as
thunder
-LRB-
thinking
,
perhaps
,
of
their
own
childhood
or
their
own
*NL*
children
-RRB-
and
bid
him
stop
that
nonsense
,
and
think
what
he
was
doing
.
*NL*
As
for
me
,
I
felt
ashamed
to
look
at
him
,
and
the
poor
child
still
comes
*NL*
about
me
in
my
dreams
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
time
,
you
should
know
,
the
Covenant
was
meeting
continual
*NL*
head-winds
and
tumbling
up
and
down
against
head-seas
,
so
that
the
*NL*
scuttle
was
almost
constantly
shut
,
and
the
forecastle
lighted
only
by
a
*NL*
swinging
lantern
on
a
beam
.
There
was
constant
labour
for
all
hands
;
the
*NL*
sails
had
to
be
made
and
shortened
every
hour
;
the
strain
told
on
the
*NL*
men
's
temper
;
there
was
a
growl
of
quarrelling
all
day
long
from
berth
*NL*
to
berth
;
and
as
I
was
never
allowed
to
set
my
foot
on
deck
,
you
*NL*
can
picture
to
yourselves
how
weary
of
my
life
I
grew
to
be
,
and
how
*NL*
impatient
for
a
change
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
a
change
I
was
to
get
,
as
you
shall
hear
;
but
I
must
first
tell
of
*NL*
a
conversation
I
had
with
Mr.
Riach
,
which
put
a
little
heart
in
me
to
*NL*
bear
my
troubles
.
Getting
him
in
a
favourable
stage
of
drink
-LRB-
for
indeed
*NL*
he
never
looked
near
me
when
he
was
sober
-RRB-
,
I
pledged
him
to
secrecy
,
*NL*
and
told
him
my
whole
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
declared
it
was
like
a
ballad
;
that
he
would
do
his
best
to
help
*NL*
me
;
that
I
should
have
paper
,
pen
,
and
ink
,
and
write
one
line
to
Mr.
*NL*
Campbell
and
another
to
Mr.
Rankeillor
;
and
that
if
I
had
told
the
*NL*
truth
,
ten
to
one
he
would
be
able
-LRB-
with
their
help
-RRB-
to
pull
me
through
*NL*
and
set
me
in
my
rights
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
in
the
meantime
,
''
says
he
,
``
keep
your
heart
up
.
You
're
not
the
only
*NL*
one
,
I
'll
tell
you
that
.
There
's
many
a
man
hoeing
tobacco
over-seas
*NL*
that
should
be
mounting
his
horse
at
his
own
door
at
home
;
many
and
*NL*
many
!
And
life
is
all
a
variorum
,
at
the
best
.
Look
at
me
:
I
'm
a
laird
's
*NL*
son
and
more
than
half
a
doctor
,
and
here
I
am
,
man-Jack
to
Hoseason
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
it
would
be
civil
to
ask
him
for
his
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
whistled
loud
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
had
one
,
''
said
he
.
``
I
like
fun
,
that
's
all
.
''
And
he
skipped
out
*NL*
of
the
forecastle
.
*NL*

CHAPTER
VIII
*NL*
*NL*
THE
ROUND-HOUSE
*NL*
*NL*
One
night
,
about
eleven
o'clock
,
a
man
of
Mr.
Riach
's
watch
-LRB-
which
was
*NL*
on
deck
-RRB-
came
below
for
his
jacket
;
and
instantly
there
began
to
go
*NL*
a
whisper
about
the
forecastle
that
``
Shuan
had
done
for
him
at
last
.
''
*NL*
There
was
no
need
of
a
name
;
we
all
knew
who
was
meant
;
but
we
had
*NL*
scarce
time
to
get
the
idea
rightly
in
our
heads
,
far
less
to
speak
of
*NL*
it
,
when
the
scuttle
was
again
flung
open
,
and
Captain
Hoseason
came
*NL*
down
the
ladder
.
He
looked
sharply
round
the
bunks
in
the
tossing
light
*NL*
of
the
lantern
;
and
then
,
walking
straight
up
to
me
,
he
addressed
me
,
to
*NL*
my
surprise
,
in
tones
of
kindness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
man
,
''
said
he
,
``
we
want
ye
to
serve
in
the
round-house
.
You
and
*NL*
Ransome
are
to
change
berths
.
Run
away
aft
with
ye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Even
as
he
spoke
,
two
seamen
appeared
in
the
scuttle
,
carrying
Ransome
*NL*
in
their
arms
;
and
the
ship
at
that
moment
giving
a
great
sheer
into
the
*NL*
sea
,
and
the
lantern
swinging
,
the
light
fell
direct
on
the
boy
's
face
.
*NL*
It
was
as
white
as
wax
,
and
had
a
look
upon
it
like
a
dreadful
smile
.
*NL*
The
blood
in
me
ran
cold
,
and
I
drew
in
my
breath
as
if
I
had
been
*NL*
struck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Run
away
aft
;
run
away
aft
with
ye
!
''
cried
Hoseason
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
at
that
I
brushed
by
the
sailors
and
the
boy
-LRB-
who
neither
spoke
nor
*NL*
moved
-RRB-
,
and
ran
up
the
ladder
on
deck
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
brig
was
sheering
swiftly
and
giddily
through
a
long
,
cresting
*NL*
swell
.
She
was
on
the
starboard
tack
,
and
on
the
left
hand
,
under
the
*NL*
arched
foot
of
the
foresail
,
I
could
see
the
sunset
still
quite
bright
.
*NL*
This
,
at
such
an
hour
of
the
night
,
surprised
me
greatly
;
but
I
was
too
*NL*
ignorant
to
draw
the
true
conclusion
--
that
we
were
going
north-about
*NL*
round
Scotland
,
and
were
now
on
the
high
sea
between
the
Orkney
and
*NL*
Shetland
Islands
,
having
avoided
the
dangerous
currents
of
the
Pentland
*NL*
Firth
.
For
my
part
,
who
had
been
so
long
shut
in
the
dark
and
knew
*NL*
nothing
of
head-winds
,
I
thought
we
might
be
half-way
or
more
across
the
*NL*
Atlantic
.
And
indeed
-LRB-
beyond
that
I
wondered
a
little
at
the
lateness
of
*NL*
the
sunset
light
-RRB-
I
gave
no
heed
to
it
,
and
pushed
on
across
the
decks
,
*NL*
running
between
the
seas
,
catching
at
ropes
,
and
only
saved
from
going
*NL*
overboard
by
one
of
the
hands
on
deck
,
who
had
been
always
kind
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
round-house
,
for
which
I
was
bound
,
and
where
I
was
now
to
sleep
and
*NL*
serve
,
stood
some
six
feet
above
the
decks
,
and
considering
the
size
of
*NL*
the
brig
,
was
of
good
dimensions
.
Inside
were
a
fixed
table
and
bench
,
*NL*
and
two
berths
,
one
for
the
captain
and
the
other
for
the
two
mates
,
*NL*
turn
and
turn
about
.
It
was
all
fitted
with
lockers
from
top
to
bottom
,
*NL*
so
as
to
stow
away
the
officers
'
belongings
and
a
part
of
the
ship
's
*NL*
stores
;
there
was
a
second
store-room
underneath
,
which
you
entered
by
a
*NL*
hatchway
in
the
middle
of
the
deck
;
indeed
,
all
the
best
of
the
meat
and
*NL*
drink
and
the
whole
of
the
powder
were
collected
in
this
place
;
and
all
*NL*
the
firearms
,
except
the
two
pieces
of
brass
ordnance
,
were
set
in
a
*NL*
rack
in
the
aftermost
wall
of
the
round-house
.
The
most
of
the
cutlasses
*NL*
were
in
another
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
small
window
with
a
shutter
on
each
side
,
and
a
skylight
in
the
roof
,
*NL*
gave
it
light
by
day
;
and
after
dark
there
was
a
lamp
always
burning
.
*NL*
It
was
burning
when
I
entered
,
not
brightly
,
but
enough
to
show
Mr.
*NL*
Shuan
sitting
at
the
table
,
with
the
brandy
bottle
and
a
tin
pannikin
*NL*
in
front
of
him
.
He
was
a
tall
man
,
strongly
made
and
very
black
;
and
he
*NL*
stared
before
him
on
the
table
like
one
stupid
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
no
notice
of
my
coming
in
;
nor
did
he
move
when
the
captain
*NL*
followed
and
leant
on
the
berth
beside
me
,
looking
darkly
at
the
mate
.
*NL*
I
stood
in
great
fear
of
Hoseason
,
and
had
my
reasons
for
it
;
but
*NL*
something
told
me
I
need
not
be
afraid
of
him
just
then
;
and
I
whispered
*NL*
in
his
ear
:
``
How
is
he
?
''
He
shook
his
head
like
one
that
does
not
know
*NL*
and
does
not
wish
to
think
,
and
his
face
was
very
stern
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
Mr.
Riach
came
in
.
He
gave
the
captain
a
glance
that
meant
the
*NL*
boy
was
dead
as
plain
as
speaking
,
and
took
his
place
like
the
rest
*NL*
of
us
;
so
that
we
all
three
stood
without
a
word
,
staring
down
at
Mr.
*NL*
Shuan
,
and
Mr.
Shuan
-LRB-
on
his
side
-RRB-
sat
without
a
word
,
looking
hard
upon
*NL*
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
of
a
sudden
he
put
out
his
hand
to
take
the
bottle
;
and
at
that
Mr.
*NL*
Riach
started
forward
and
caught
it
away
from
him
,
rather
by
surprise
*NL*
than
violence
,
crying
out
,
with
an
oath
,
that
there
had
been
too
much
of
*NL*
this
work
altogether
,
and
that
a
judgment
would
fall
upon
the
ship
.
*NL*
And
as
he
spoke
-LRB-
the
weather
sliding-doors
standing
open
-RRB-
he
tossed
the
*NL*
bottle
into
the
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Shuan
was
on
his
feet
in
a
trice
;
he
still
looked
dazed
,
but
he
*NL*
meant
murder
,
ay
,
and
would
have
done
it
,
for
the
second
time
that
*NL*
night
,
had
not
the
captain
stepped
in
between
him
and
his
victim
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sit
down
!
''
roars
the
captain
.
``
Ye
sot
and
swine
,
do
ye
know
what
ye
've
*NL*
done
?
Ye
've
murdered
the
boy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Shuan
seemed
to
understand
;
for
he
sat
down
again
,
and
put
up
his
*NL*
hand
to
his
brow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
said
,
``
he
brought
me
a
dirty
pannikin
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
word
,
the
captain
and
I
and
Mr.
Riach
all
looked
at
each
other
*NL*
for
a
second
with
a
kind
of
frightened
look
;
and
then
Hoseason
walked
*NL*
up
to
his
chief
officer
,
took
him
by
the
shoulder
,
led
him
across
to
his
*NL*
bunk
,
and
bade
him
lie
down
and
go
to
sleep
,
as
you
might
speak
to
a
bad
*NL*
child
.
The
murderer
cried
a
little
,
but
he
took
off
his
sea-boots
and
*NL*
obeyed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
cried
Mr.
Riach
,
with
a
dreadful
voice
,
``
ye
should
have
interfered
*NL*
long
syne
.
It
's
too
late
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Riach
,
''
said
the
captain
,
``
this
night
's
work
must
never
be
kennt
*NL*
in
Dysart
.
The
boy
went
overboard
,
sir
;
that
's
what
the
story
is
;
and
I
*NL*
would
give
five
pounds
out
of
my
pocket
it
was
true
!
''
He
turned
to
the
*NL*
table
.
``
What
made
ye
throw
the
good
bottle
away
?
''
he
added
.
``
There
was
*NL*
nae
sense
in
that
,
sir
.
Here
,
David
,
draw
me
another
.
They
're
in
the
*NL*
bottom
locker
;
''
and
he
tossed
me
a
key
.
``
Ye
'll
need
a
glass
yourself
,
*NL*
sir
,
''
he
added
to
Riach
.
``
Yon
was
an
ugly
thing
to
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
pair
sat
down
and
hob-a-nobbed
;
and
while
they
did
so
,
the
*NL*
murderer
,
who
had
been
lying
and
whimpering
in
his
berth
,
raised
himself
*NL*
upon
his
elbow
and
looked
at
them
and
at
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
the
first
night
of
my
new
duties
;
and
in
the
course
of
the
next
*NL*
day
I
had
got
well
into
the
run
of
them
.
I
had
to
serve
at
the
meals
,
*NL*
which
the
captain
took
at
regular
hours
,
sitting
down
with
the
officer
*NL*
who
was
off
duty
;
all
the
day
through
I
would
be
running
with
a
dram
*NL*
to
one
or
other
of
my
three
masters
;
and
at
night
I
slept
on
a
blanket
*NL*
thrown
on
the
deck
boards
at
the
aftermost
end
of
the
round-house
,
and
*NL*
right
in
the
draught
of
the
two
doors
.
It
was
a
hard
and
a
cold
bed
;
*NL*
nor
was
I
suffered
to
sleep
without
interruption
;
for
some
one
would
be
*NL*
always
coming
in
from
deck
to
get
a
dram
,
and
when
a
fresh
watch
was
*NL*
to
be
set
,
two
and
sometimes
all
three
would
sit
down
and
brew
a
bowl
*NL*
together
.
How
they
kept
their
health
,
I
know
not
,
any
more
than
how
I
*NL*
kept
my
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
in
other
ways
it
was
an
easy
service
.
There
was
no
cloth
to
lay
;
*NL*
the
meals
were
either
of
oatmeal
porridge
or
salt
junk
,
except
twice
a
*NL*
week
,
when
there
was
duff
:
and
though
I
was
clumsy
enough
and
-LRB-
not
being
*NL*
firm
on
my
sealegs
-RRB-
sometimes
fell
with
what
I
was
bringing
them
,
both
*NL*
Mr.
Riach
and
the
captain
were
singularly
patient
.
I
could
not
but
fancy
*NL*
they
were
making
up
lee-way
with
their
consciences
,
and
that
they
*NL*
would
scarce
have
been
so
good
with
me
if
they
had
not
been
worse
with
*NL*
Ransome
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Mr.
Shuan
,
the
drink
or
his
crime
,
or
the
two
together
,
had
*NL*
certainly
troubled
his
mind
.
I
can
not
say
I
ever
saw
him
in
his
proper
*NL*
wits
.
He
never
grew
used
to
my
being
there
,
stared
at
me
continually
*NL*
-LRB-
sometimes
,
I
could
have
thought
,
with
terror
-RRB-
,
and
more
than
once
drew
*NL*
back
from
my
hand
when
I
was
serving
him
.
I
was
pretty
sure
from
the
*NL*
first
that
he
had
no
clear
mind
of
what
he
had
done
,
and
on
my
second
*NL*
day
in
the
round-house
I
had
the
proof
of
it
.
We
were
alone
,
and
he
had
*NL*
been
staring
at
me
a
long
time
,
when
all
at
once
,
up
he
got
,
as
pale
as
*NL*
death
,
and
came
close
up
to
me
,
to
my
great
terror
.
But
I
had
no
cause
*NL*
to
be
afraid
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
not
here
before
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
''
said
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
another
boy
?
''
he
asked
again
;
and
when
I
had
answered
him
,
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
says
he
,
``
I
thought
that
,
''
and
went
and
sat
down
,
without
another
*NL*
word
,
except
to
call
for
brandy
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
may
think
it
strange
,
but
for
all
the
horror
I
had
,
I
was
still
*NL*
sorry
for
him
.
He
was
a
married
man
,
with
a
wife
in
Leith
;
but
whether
*NL*
or
no
he
had
a
family
,
I
have
now
forgotten
;
I
hope
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
Altogether
it
was
no
very
hard
life
for
the
time
it
lasted
,
which
-LRB-
as
*NL*
you
are
to
hear
-RRB-
was
not
long
.
I
was
as
well
fed
as
the
best
of
them
;
*NL*
even
their
pickles
,
which
were
the
great
dainty
,
I
was
allowed
my
share
*NL*
of
;
and
had
I
liked
I
might
have
been
drunk
from
morning
to
night
,
like
*NL*
Mr.
Shuan
.
I
had
company
,
too
,
and
good
company
of
its
sort
.
Mr.
Riach
,
*NL*
who
had
been
to
the
college
,
spoke
to
me
like
a
friend
when
he
was
not
*NL*
sulking
,
and
told
me
many
curious
things
,
and
some
that
were
informing
;
*NL*
and
even
the
captain
,
though
he
kept
me
at
the
stick
's
end
the
most
part
*NL*
of
the
time
,
would
sometimes
unbuckle
a
bit
,
and
tell
me
of
the
fine
*NL*
countries
he
had
visited
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
shadow
of
poor
Ransome
,
to
be
sure
,
lay
on
all
four
of
us
,
and
on
*NL*
me
and
Mr.
Shuan
in
particular
,
most
heavily
.
And
then
I
had
another
*NL*
trouble
of
my
own
.
Here
I
was
,
doing
dirty
work
for
three
men
that
I
*NL*
looked
down
upon
,
and
one
of
whom
,
at
least
,
should
have
hung
upon
a
*NL*
gallows
;
that
was
for
the
present
;
and
as
for
the
future
,
I
could
only
*NL*
see
myself
slaving
alongside
of
negroes
in
the
tobacco
fields
.
Mr.
*NL*
Riach
,
perhaps
from
caution
,
would
never
suffer
me
to
say
another
word
*NL*
about
my
story
;
the
captain
,
whom
I
tried
to
approach
,
rebuffed
me
like
*NL*
a
dog
and
would
not
hear
a
word
;
and
as
the
days
came
and
went
,
my
heart
*NL*
sank
lower
and
lower
,
till
I
was
even
glad
of
the
work
which
kept
me
*NL*
from
thinking
.

CHAPTER
IX
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
THE
MAN
WITH
THE
BELT
OF
GOLD
*NL*
*NL*
More
than
a
week
went
by
,
in
which
the
ill-luck
that
had
hitherto
*NL*
pursued
the
Covenant
upon
this
voyage
grew
yet
more
strongly
marked
.
*NL*
Some
days
she
made
a
little
way
;
others
,
she
was
driven
actually
back
.
*NL*
At
last
we
were
beaten
so
far
to
the
south
that
we
tossed
and
tacked
to
*NL*
and
fro
the
whole
of
the
ninth
day
,
within
sight
of
Cape
Wrath
and
the
*NL*
wild
,
rocky
coast
on
either
hand
of
it
.
There
followed
on
that
a
council
*NL*
of
the
officers
,
and
some
decision
which
I
did
not
rightly
understand
,
*NL*
seeing
only
the
result
:
that
we
had
made
a
fair
wind
of
a
foul
one
and
*NL*
were
running
south
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tenth
afternoon
there
was
a
falling
swell
and
a
thick
,
wet
,
white
*NL*
fog
that
hid
one
end
of
the
brig
from
the
other
.
All
afternoon
,
when
*NL*
I
went
on
deck
,
I
saw
men
and
officers
listening
hard
over
the
*NL*
bulwarks
--
``
for
breakers
,
''
they
said
;
and
though
I
did
not
so
much
as
*NL*
understand
the
word
,
I
felt
danger
in
the
air
,
and
was
excited
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maybe
about
ten
at
night
,
I
was
serving
Mr.
Riach
and
the
captain
at
*NL*
their
supper
,
when
the
ship
struck
something
with
a
great
sound
,
and
we
*NL*
heard
voices
singing
out
.
My
two
masters
leaped
to
their
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
struck
!
''
said
Mr.
Riach
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
''
said
the
captain
.
``
We
've
only
run
a
boat
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
they
hurried
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
was
in
the
right
of
it
.
We
had
run
down
a
boat
in
the
fog
,
*NL*
and
she
had
parted
in
the
midst
and
gone
to
the
bottom
with
all
her
crew
*NL*
but
one
.
This
man
-LRB-
as
I
heard
afterwards
-RRB-
had
been
sitting
in
the
stern
*NL*
as
a
passenger
,
while
the
rest
were
on
the
benches
rowing
.
At
the
moment
*NL*
of
the
blow
,
the
stern
had
been
thrown
into
the
air
,
and
the
man
-LRB-
having
*NL*
his
hands
free
,
and
for
all
he
was
encumbered
with
a
frieze
overcoat
*NL*
that
came
below
his
knees
-RRB-
had
leaped
up
and
caught
hold
of
the
brig
's
*NL*
bowsprit
.
It
showed
he
had
luck
and
much
agility
and
unusual
strength
,
*NL*
that
he
should
have
thus
saved
himself
from
such
a
pass
.
And
yet
,
when
*NL*
the
captain
brought
him
into
the
round-house
,
and
I
set
eyes
on
him
for
*NL*
the
first
time
,
he
looked
as
cool
as
I
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
smallish
in
stature
,
but
well
set
and
as
nimble
as
a
goat
;
his
*NL*
face
was
of
a
good
open
expression
,
but
sunburnt
very
dark
,
and
heavily
*NL*
freckled
and
pitted
with
the
small-pox
;
his
eyes
were
unusually
light
*NL*
and
had
a
kind
of
dancing
madness
in
them
,
that
was
both
engaging
and
*NL*
alarming
;
and
when
he
took
off
his
great-coat
,
he
laid
a
pair
of
fine
*NL*
silver-mounted
pistols
on
the
table
,
and
I
saw
that
he
was
belted
with
*NL*
a
great
sword
.
His
manners
,
besides
,
were
elegant
,
and
he
pledged
the
*NL*
captain
handsomely
.
Altogether
I
thought
of
him
,
at
the
first
sight
,
*NL*
that
here
was
a
man
I
would
rather
call
my
friend
than
my
enemy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
,
too
,
was
taking
his
observations
,
but
rather
of
the
man
's
*NL*
clothes
than
his
person
.
And
to
be
sure
,
as
soon
as
he
had
taken
off
*NL*
the
great-coat
,
he
showed
forth
mighty
fine
for
the
round-house
of
a
*NL*
merchant
brig
:
having
a
hat
with
feathers
,
a
red
waistcoat
,
breeches
*NL*
of
black
plush
,
and
a
blue
coat
with
silver
buttons
and
handsome
silver
*NL*
lace
;
costly
clothes
,
though
somewhat
spoiled
with
the
fog
and
being
*NL*
slept
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
vexed
,
sir
,
about
the
boat
,
''
says
the
captain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
some
pretty
men
gone
to
the
bottom
,
''
said
the
stranger
,
``
that
*NL*
I
would
rather
see
on
the
dry
land
again
than
half
a
score
of
boats
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Friends
of
yours
?
''
said
Hoseason
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
none
such
friends
in
your
country
,
''
was
the
reply
.
``
They
would
*NL*
have
died
for
me
like
dogs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
''
said
the
captain
,
still
watching
him
,
``
there
are
more
men
*NL*
in
the
world
than
boats
to
put
them
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
's
true
,
too
,
''
cried
the
other
,
``
and
ye
seem
to
be
a
gentleman
*NL*
of
great
penetration
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
in
France
,
sir
,
''
says
the
captain
,
so
that
it
was
plain
he
*NL*
meant
more
by
the
words
than
showed
upon
the
face
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
''
says
the
other
,
``
and
so
has
many
a
pretty
man
,
for
the
*NL*
matter
of
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
doubt
,
sir
,
''
says
the
captain
,
``
and
fine
coats
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oho
!
''
says
the
stranger
,
``
is
that
how
the
wind
sets
?
''
And
he
laid
his
*NL*
hand
quickly
on
his
pistols
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
hasty
,
''
said
the
captain
.
``
Do
n't
do
a
mischief
before
ye
*NL*
see
the
need
of
it
.
Ye
've
a
French
soldier
's
coat
upon
your
back
and
a
*NL*
Scotch
tongue
in
your
head
,
to
be
sure
;
but
so
has
many
an
honest
fellow
*NL*
in
these
days
,
and
I
dare
say
none
the
worse
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
?
''
said
the
gentleman
in
the
fine
coat
:
``
are
ye
of
the
honest
party
?
''
*NL*
-LRB-
meaning
,
Was
he
a
Jacobite
?
for
each
side
,
in
these
sort
of
civil
*NL*
broils
,
takes
the
name
of
honesty
for
its
own
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
sir
,
''
replied
the
captain
,
``
I
am
a
true-blue
Protestant
,
and
I
*NL*
thank
God
for
it
.
''
-LRB-
It
was
the
first
word
of
any
religion
I
had
ever
*NL*
heard
from
him
,
but
I
learnt
afterwards
he
was
a
great
church-goer
while
*NL*
on
shore
.
-RRB-
``
But
,
for
all
that
,
''
says
he
,
``
I
can
be
sorry
to
see
another
*NL*
man
with
his
back
to
the
wall
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
ye
so
,
indeed
?
''
asked
the
Jacobite
.
``
Well
,
sir
,
to
be
quite
plain
*NL*
with
ye
,
I
am
one
of
those
honest
gentlemen
that
were
in
trouble
about
*NL*
the
years
forty-five
and
six
;
and
-LRB-
to
be
still
quite
plain
with
ye
-RRB-
if
*NL*
I
got
into
the
hands
of
any
of
the
red-coated
gentry
,
it
's
like
it
would
*NL*
go
hard
with
me
.
Now
,
sir
,
I
was
for
France
;
and
there
was
a
French
ship
*NL*
cruising
here
to
pick
me
up
;
but
she
gave
us
the
go-by
in
the
fog
--
as
I
*NL*
wish
from
the
heart
that
ye
had
done
yoursel
'
!
And
the
best
that
I
can
*NL*
say
is
this
:
If
ye
can
set
me
ashore
where
I
was
going
,
I
have
that
upon
*NL*
me
will
reward
you
highly
for
your
trouble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
France
?
''
says
the
captain
.
``
No
,
sir
;
that
I
can
not
do
.
But
where
ye
*NL*
come
from
--
we
might
talk
of
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
,
unhappily
,
he
observed
me
standing
in
my
corner
,
and
packed
*NL*
me
off
to
the
galley
to
get
supper
for
the
gentleman
.
I
lost
no
time
,
*NL*
I
promise
you
;
and
when
I
came
back
into
the
round-house
,
I
found
the
*NL*
gentleman
had
taken
a
money-belt
from
about
his
waist
,
and
poured
out
*NL*
a
guinea
or
two
upon
the
table
.
The
captain
was
looking
at
the
guineas
,
*NL*
and
then
at
the
belt
,
and
then
at
the
gentleman
's
face
;
and
I
thought
he
*NL*
seemed
excited
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Half
of
it
,
''
he
cried
,
``
and
I
'm
your
man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
swept
back
the
guineas
into
the
belt
,
and
put
it
on
again
*NL*
under
his
waistcoat
.
``
I
have
told
ye
sir
,
''
said
he
,
``
that
not
one
doit
*NL*
of
it
belongs
to
me
.
It
belongs
to
my
chieftain
,
''
and
here
he
touched
*NL*
his
hat
,
``
and
while
I
would
be
but
a
silly
messenger
to
grudge
some
of
*NL*
it
that
the
rest
might
come
safe
,
I
should
show
myself
a
hound
indeed
if
*NL*
I
bought
my
own
carcase
any
too
dear
.
Thirty
guineas
on
the
sea-side
,
or
*NL*
sixty
if
ye
set
me
on
the
Linnhe
Loch
.
Take
it
,
if
ye
will
;
if
not
,
ye
*NL*
can
do
your
worst
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
''
said
Hoseason
.
``
And
if
I
give
ye
over
to
the
soldiers
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye
would
make
a
fool
's
bargain
,
''
said
the
other
.
``
My
chief
,
let
me
tell
*NL*
you
,
sir
,
is
forfeited
,
like
every
honest
man
in
Scotland
.
His
estate
*NL*
is
in
the
hands
of
the
man
they
call
King
George
;
and
it
is
his
officers
*NL*
that
collect
the
rents
,
or
try
to
collect
them
.
But
for
the
honour
of
*NL*
Scotland
,
the
poor
tenant
bodies
take
a
thought
upon
their
chief
lying
*NL*
in
exile
;
and
this
money
is
a
part
of
that
very
rent
for
which
King
*NL*
George
is
looking
.
Now
,
sir
,
ye
seem
to
me
to
be
a
man
that
understands
*NL*
things
:
bring
this
money
within
the
reach
of
Government
,
and
how
much
of
*NL*
it
'll
come
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Little
enough
,
to
be
sure
,
''
said
Hoseason
;
and
then
,
``
if
they
knew
,
''
he
*NL*
added
,
drily
.
``
But
I
think
,
if
I
was
to
try
,
that
I
could
hold
my
tongue
*NL*
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
but
I
'll
begowk
*
ye
there
!
''
cried
the
gentleman
.
``
Play
me
false
,
*NL*
and
I
'll
play
you
cunning
.
If
a
hand
is
laid
upon
me
,
they
shall
ken
*NL*
what
money
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*
Befool
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
returned
the
captain
,
``
what
must
be
must
.
Sixty
guineas
,
and
*NL*
done
.
Here
's
my
hand
upon
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
here
's
mine
,
''
said
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
thereupon
the
captain
went
out
-LRB-
rather
hurriedly
,
I
thought
-RRB-
,
and
*NL*
left
me
alone
in
the
round-house
with
the
stranger
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
period
-LRB-
so
soon
after
the
forty-five
-RRB-
there
were
many
exiled
*NL*
gentlemen
coming
back
at
the
peril
of
their
lives
,
either
to
see
their
*NL*
friends
or
to
collect
a
little
money
;
and
as
for
the
Highland
chiefs
*NL*
that
had
been
forfeited
,
it
was
a
common
matter
of
talk
how
their
*NL*
tenants
would
stint
themselves
to
send
them
money
,
and
their
clansmen
*NL*
outface
the
soldiery
to
get
it
in
,
and
run
the
gauntlet
of
our
great
*NL*
navy
to
carry
it
across
.
All
this
I
had
,
of
course
,
heard
tell
of
;
and
*NL*
now
I
had
a
man
under
my
eyes
whose
life
was
forfeit
on
all
these
counts
*NL*
and
upon
one
more
,
for
he
was
not
only
a
rebel
and
a
smuggler
of
rents
,
*NL*
but
had
taken
service
with
King
Louis
of
France
.
And
as
if
all
this
*NL*
were
not
enough
,
he
had
a
belt
full
of
golden
guineas
round
his
loins
.
*NL*
Whatever
my
opinions
,
I
could
not
look
on
such
a
man
without
a
lively
*NL*
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
you
're
a
Jacobite
?
''
said
I
,
as
I
set
meat
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
''
said
he
,
beginning
to
eat
.
``
And
you
,
by
your
long
face
,
should
be
*NL*
a
Whig
?
''
*
*NL*
*NL*
*
Whig
or
Whigamore
was
the
cant
name
for
those
who
were
*NL*
loyal
to
King
George
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Betwixt
and
between
,
''
said
I
,
not
to
annoy
him
;
for
indeed
I
was
as
*NL*
good
a
Whig
as
Mr.
Campbell
could
make
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
's
naething
,
''
said
he
.
``
But
I
'm
saying
,
Mr.
*NL*
Betwixt-and-Between
,
''
he
added
,
``
this
bottle
of
yours
is
dry
;
and
it
's
*NL*
hard
if
I
'm
to
pay
sixty
guineas
and
be
grudged
a
dram
upon
the
back
of
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
go
and
ask
for
the
key
,
''
said
I
,
and
stepped
on
deck
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fog
was
as
close
as
ever
,
but
the
swell
almost
down
.
They
had
laid
*NL*
the
brig
to
,
not
knowing
precisely
where
they
were
,
and
the
wind
-LRB-
what
*NL*
little
there
was
of
it
-RRB-
not
serving
well
for
their
true
course
.
Some
of
*NL*
the
hands
were
still
hearkening
for
breakers
;
but
the
captain
and
the
*NL*
two
officers
were
in
the
waist
with
their
heads
together
.
It
struck
me
*NL*
-LRB-
I
do
n't
know
why
-RRB-
that
they
were
after
no
good
;
and
the
first
word
I
*NL*
heard
,
as
I
drew
softly
near
,
more
than
confirmed
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Mr.
Riach
,
crying
out
as
if
upon
a
sudden
thought
:
``
Could
n't
we
*NL*
wile
him
out
of
the
round-house
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
better
where
he
is
,
''
returned
Hoseason
;
``
he
has
n't
room
to
use
his
*NL*
sword
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
's
true
,
''
said
Riach
;
``
but
he
's
hard
to
come
at
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hut
!
''
said
Hoseason
.
``
We
can
get
the
man
in
talk
,
one
upon
each
side
,
*NL*
and
pin
him
by
the
two
arms
;
or
if
that
'll
not
hold
,
sir
,
we
can
make
a
*NL*
run
by
both
the
doors
and
get
him
under
hand
before
he
has
the
time
to
*NL*
draw
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
hearing
,
I
was
seized
with
both
fear
and
anger
at
these
*NL*
treacherous
,
greedy
,
bloody
men
that
I
sailed
with
.
My
first
mind
was
to
*NL*
run
away
;
my
second
was
bolder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Captain
,
''
said
I
,
``
the
gentleman
is
seeking
a
dram
,
and
the
bottle
's
*NL*
out
.
Will
you
give
me
the
key
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
all
started
and
turned
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
here
's
our
chance
to
get
the
firearms
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Riach
cried
;
and
then
to
me
:
``
Hark
ye
,
David
,
''
he
said
,
``
do
ye
ken
where
*NL*
the
pistols
are
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
ay
,
''
put
in
Hoseason
.
``
David
kens
;
David
's
a
good
lad
.
Ye
see
,
*NL*
David
my
man
,
yon
wild
Hielandman
is
a
danger
to
the
ship
,
besides
being
*NL*
a
rank
foe
to
King
George
,
God
bless
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
never
been
so
be-Davided
since
I
came
on
board
:
but
I
said
Yes
,
as
*NL*
if
all
I
heard
were
quite
natural
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
trouble
is
,
''
resumed
the
captain
,
``
that
all
our
firelocks
,
great
*NL*
and
little
,
are
in
the
round-house
under
this
man
's
nose
;
likewise
the
*NL*
powder
.
Now
,
if
I
,
or
one
of
the
officers
,
was
to
go
in
and
take
them
,
*NL*
he
would
fall
to
thinking
.
But
a
lad
like
you
,
David
,
might
snap
up
a
*NL*
horn
and
a
pistol
or
two
without
remark
.
And
if
ye
can
do
it
cleverly
,
*NL*
I
'll
bear
it
in
mind
when
it
'll
be
good
for
you
to
have
friends
;
and
*NL*
that
's
when
we
come
to
Carolina
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Mr.
Riach
whispered
him
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
right
,
sir
,
''
said
the
captain
;
and
then
to
myself
:
``
And
see
here
,
*NL*
David
,
yon
man
has
a
beltful
of
gold
,
and
I
give
you
my
word
that
you
*NL*
shall
have
your
fingers
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
I
would
do
as
he
wished
,
though
indeed
I
had
scarce
breath
to
*NL*
speak
with
;
and
upon
that
he
gave
me
the
key
of
the
spirit
locker
,
and
I
*NL*
began
to
go
slowly
back
to
the
round-house
.
What
was
I
to
do
?
They
*NL*
were
dogs
and
thieves
;
they
had
stolen
me
from
my
own
country
;
they
had
*NL*
killed
poor
Ransome
;
and
was
I
to
hold
the
candle
to
another
murder
?
But
*NL*
then
,
upon
the
other
hand
,
there
was
the
fear
of
death
very
plain
before
*NL*
me
;
for
what
could
a
boy
and
a
man
,
if
they
were
as
brave
as
lions
,
*NL*
against
a
whole
ship
's
company
?
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
still
arguing
it
back
and
forth
,
and
getting
no
great
clearness
,
*NL*
when
I
came
into
the
round-house
and
saw
the
Jacobite
eating
his
supper
*NL*
under
the
lamp
;
and
at
that
my
mind
was
made
up
all
in
a
moment
.
I
have
*NL*
no
credit
by
it
;
it
was
by
no
choice
of
mine
,
but
as
if
by
compulsion
,
*NL*
that
I
walked
right
up
to
the
table
and
put
my
hand
on
his
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
ye
want
to
be
killed
?
''
said
I
.
He
sprang
to
his
feet
,
and
looked
a
*NL*
question
at
me
as
clear
as
if
he
had
spoken
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
!
''
cried
I
,
``
they
're
all
murderers
here
;
it
's
a
ship
full
of
them
!
*NL*
They
've
murdered
a
boy
already
.
Now
it
's
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
ay
,
''
said
he
;
``
but
they
have
n't
got
me
yet
.
''
And
then
looking
at
me
*NL*
curiously
,
``
Will
ye
stand
with
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
I
!
''
said
I.
``
I
am
no
thief
,
nor
yet
murderer
.
I
'll
stand
by
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
then
,
''
said
he
,
``
what
's
your
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
David
Balfour
,
''
said
I
;
and
then
,
thinking
that
a
man
with
so
fine
a
*NL*
coat
must
like
fine
people
,
I
added
for
the
first
time
,
``
of
Shaws
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
never
occurred
to
him
to
doubt
me
,
for
a
Highlander
is
used
to
see
*NL*
great
gentlefolk
in
great
poverty
;
but
as
he
had
no
estate
of
his
own
,
*NL*
my
words
nettled
a
very
childish
vanity
he
had
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
name
is
Stewart
,
''
he
said
,
drawing
himself
up
.
``
Alan
Breck
,
they
*NL*
call
me
.
A
king
's
name
is
good
enough
for
me
,
though
I
bear
it
plain
and
*NL*
have
the
name
of
no
farm-midden
to
clap
to
the
hind-end
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
having
administered
this
rebuke
,
as
though
it
were
something
of
a
*NL*
chief
importance
,
he
turned
to
examine
our
defences
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
round-house
was
built
very
strong
,
to
support
the
breaching
of
the
*NL*
seas
.
Of
its
five
apertures
,
only
the
skylight
and
the
two
doors
were
*NL*
large
enough
for
the
passage
of
a
man
.
The
doors
,
besides
,
could
be
*NL*
drawn
close
:
they
were
of
stout
oak
,
and
ran
in
grooves
,
and
were
fitted
*NL*
with
hooks
to
keep
them
either
shut
or
open
,
as
the
need
arose
.
The
*NL*
one
that
was
already
shut
I
secured
in
this
fashion
;
but
when
I
was
*NL*
proceeding
to
slide
to
the
other
,
Alan
stopped
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
David
,
''
said
he
--
``
for
I
cannae
bring
to
mind
the
name
of
your
landed
*NL*
estate
,
and
so
will
make
so
bold
as
to
call
you
David
--
that
door
,
being
*NL*
open
,
is
the
best
part
of
my
defences
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
yet
better
shut
,
''
says
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
so
,
David
,
''
says
he
.
``
Ye
see
,
I
have
but
one
face
;
but
so
long
as
*NL*
that
door
is
open
and
my
face
to
it
,
the
best
part
of
my
enemies
will
be
*NL*
in
front
of
me
,
where
I
would
aye
wish
to
find
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
gave
me
from
the
rack
a
cutlass
-LRB-
of
which
there
were
a
few
*NL*
besides
the
firearms
-RRB-
,
choosing
it
with
great
care
,
shaking
his
head
and
*NL*
saying
he
had
never
in
all
his
life
seen
poorer
weapons
;
and
next
he
set
*NL*
me
down
to
the
table
with
a
powder-horn
,
a
bag
of
bullets
and
all
the
*NL*
pistols
,
which
he
bade
me
charge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
will
be
better
work
,
let
me
tell
you
,
''
said
he
,
``
for
a
*NL*
gentleman
of
decent
birth
,
than
scraping
plates
and
raxing
*
drams
to
a
*NL*
wheen
tarry
sailors
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*
Reaching
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thereupon
he
stood
up
in
the
midst
with
his
face
to
the
door
,
and
*NL*
drawing
his
great
sword
,
made
trial
of
the
room
he
had
to
wield
it
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
stick
to
the
point
,
''
he
said
,
shaking
his
head
;
``
and
that
's
a
*NL*
pity
,
too
.
It
does
n't
set
my
genius
,
which
is
all
for
the
upper
guard
.
*NL*
And
,
now
,
''
said
he
,
``
do
you
keep
on
charging
the
pistols
,
and
give
heed
*NL*
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
I
would
listen
closely
.
My
chest
was
tight
,
my
mouth
dry
,
the
*NL*
light
dark
to
my
eyes
;
the
thought
of
the
numbers
that
were
soon
to
*NL*
leap
in
upon
us
kept
my
heart
in
a
flutter
:
and
the
sea
,
which
I
heard
*NL*
washing
round
the
brig
,
and
where
I
thought
my
dead
body
would
be
cast
*NL*
ere
morning
,
ran
in
my
mind
strangely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
First
of
all
,
''
said
he
,
``
how
many
are
against
us
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
reckoned
them
up
;
and
such
was
the
hurry
of
my
mind
,
I
had
to
cast
the
*NL*
numbers
twice
.
``
Fifteen
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
Alan
whistled
.
``
Well
,
''
said
he
,
``
that
ca
n't
be
cured
.
And
now
follow
me
.
*NL*
It
is
my
part
to
keep
this
door
,
where
I
look
for
the
main
battle
.
In
*NL*
that
,
ye
have
no
hand
.
And
mind
and
dinnae
fire
to
this
side
unless
they
*NL*
get
me
down
;
for
I
would
rather
have
ten
foes
in
front
of
me
than
one
*NL*
friend
like
you
cracking
pistols
at
my
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
,
indeed
I
was
no
great
shot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
's
very
bravely
said
,
''
he
cried
,
in
a
great
admiration
of
my
*NL*
candour
.
``
There
's
many
a
pretty
gentleman
that
wouldnae
dare
to
say
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
then
,
sir
,
''
said
I
,
``
there
is
the
door
behind
you
,
which
they
may
*NL*
perhaps
break
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
''
said
he
,
``
and
that
is
a
part
of
your
work
.
No
sooner
the
pistols
*NL*
charged
,
than
ye
must
climb
up
into
yon
bed
where
ye
're
handy
at
the
*NL*
window
;
and
if
they
lift
hand
against
the
door
,
ye
're
to
shoot
.
But
*NL*
that
's
not
all
.
Let
's
make
a
bit
of
a
soldier
of
ye

What
else
*NL*
have
ye
to
guard
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
the
skylight
,
''
said
I.
``
But
indeed
,
Mr.
Stewart
,
I
would
need
*NL*
to
have
eyes
upon
both
sides
to
keep
the
two
of
them
;
for
when
my
face
*NL*
is
at
the
one
,
my
back
is
to
the
other

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
's
very
true

said
Alan
.
``
But
have
ye
no
ears
to
your
head

*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
!

cried
I.
``
I
must
hear
the
bursting
of
the
glass
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye
have
some
rudiments
of
sense

said
Alan
,
grimly
.

CHAPTER
X
*NL*
*NL*
THE
SIEGE
OF
THE
ROUND-HOUSE
*NL*
*NL*
But
now
our
time
of
truce
was
come
to
an
end
.
Those
on
deck
had
waited
*NL*
for
my
coming
till
they
grew
impatient
;
and
scarce
had
Alan
spoken
,
when
*NL*
the
captain
showed
face
in
the
open
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stand
!
''
cried
Alan
,
and
pointed
his
sword
at
him
.
The
captain
stood
,
*NL*
indeed
;
but
he
neither
winced
nor
drew
back
a
foot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
naked
sword
?
''
says
he
.
``
This
is
a
strange
return
for
hospitality
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
ye
see
me
?
''
said
Alan
.
``
I
am
come
of
kings
;
I
bear
a
king
's
name
.
My
*NL*
badge
is
the
oak
.
Do
ye
see
my
sword
?
It
has
slashed
the
heads
off
mair
*NL*
Whigamores
than
you
have
toes
upon
your
feet
.
Call
up
your
vermin
to
*NL*
your
back
,
sir
,
and
fall
on
!
The
sooner
the
clash
begins
,
the
sooner
*NL*
ye
'll
taste
this
steel
throughout
your
vitals
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
said
nothing
to
Alan
,
but
he
looked
over
at
me
with
an
ugly
*NL*
look
.
``
David
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
'll
mind
this
;
''
and
the
sound
of
his
voice
*NL*
went
through
me
with
a
jar
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
moment
he
was
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
''
said
Alan
,
``
let
your
hand
keep
your
head
,
for
the
grip
is
*NL*
coming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alan
drew
a
dirk
,
which
he
held
in
his
left
hand
in
case
they
should
run
*NL*
in
under
his
sword
.
I
,
on
my
part
,
clambered
up
into
the
berth
with
*NL*
an
armful
of
pistols
and
something
of
a
heavy
heart
,
and
set
open
the
*NL*
window
where
I
was
to
watch
.
It
was
a
small
part
of
the
deck
that
I
*NL*
could
overlook
,
but
enough
for
our
purpose
.
The
sea
had
gone
down
,
and
*NL*
the
wind
was
steady
and
kept
the
sails
quiet
;
so
that
there
was
a
*NL*
great
stillness
in
the
ship
,
in
which
I
made
sure
I
heard
the
sound
of
*NL*
muttering
voices
.
A
little
after
,
and
there
came
a
clash
of
steel
upon
*NL*
the
deck
,
by
which
I
knew
they
were
dealing
out
the
cutlasses
and
one
*NL*
had
been
let
fall
;
and
after
that
,
silence
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
not
know
if
I
was
what
you
call
afraid
;
but
my
heart
beat
like
a
*NL*
bird
's
,
both
quick
and
little
;
and
there
was
a
dimness
came
before
my
*NL*
eyes
which
I
continually
rubbed
away
,
and
which
continually
returned
.
As
*NL*
for
hope
,
I
had
none
;
but
only
a
darkness
of
despair
and
a
sort
of
anger
*NL*
against
all
the
world
that
made
me
long
to
sell
my
life
as
dear
as
I
was
*NL*
able
.
I
tried
to
pray
,
I
remember
,
but
that
same
hurry
of
my
mind
,
like
*NL*
a
man
running
,
would
not
suffer
me
to
think
upon
the
words
;
and
my
chief
*NL*
wish
was
to
have
the
thing
begin
and
be
done
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
came
all
of
a
sudden
when
it
did
,
with
a
rush
of
feet
and
a
roar
,
and
*NL*
then
a
shout
from
Alan
,
and
a
sound
of
blows
and
some
one
crying
out
*NL*
as
if
hurt
.
I
looked
back
over
my
shoulder
,
and
saw
Mr.
Shuan
in
the
*NL*
doorway
,
crossing
blades
with
Alan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
him
that
killed
the
boy
!
''
I
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
to
your
window
!
''
said
Alan
;
and
as
I
turned
back
to
my
place
,
I
*NL*
saw
him
pass
his
sword
through
the
mate
's
body
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
none
too
soon
for
me
to
look
to
my
own
part
;
for
my
head
was
*NL*
scarce
back
at
the
window
,
before
five
men
,
carrying
a
spare
yard
for
*NL*
a
battering-ram
,
ran
past
me
and
took
post
to
drive
the
door
in
.
I
had
*NL*
never
fired
with
a
pistol
in
my
life
,
and
not
often
with
a
gun
;
far
less
*NL*
against
a
fellow-creature
.
But
it
was
now
or
never
;
and
just
as
they
*NL*
swang
the
yard
,
I
cried
out
:
``
Take
that
!
''
and
shot
into
their
midst
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
must
have
hit
one
of
them
,
for
he
sang
out
and
gave
back
a
step
,
and
*NL*
the
rest
stopped
as
if
a
little
disconcerted
.
Before
they
had
time
to
*NL*
recover
,
I
sent
another
ball
over
their
heads
;
and
at
my
third
shot
*NL*
-LRB-
which
went
as
wide
as
the
second
-RRB-
the
whole
party
threw
down
the
yard
*NL*
and
ran
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
I
looked
round
again
into
the
deck-house
.
The
whole
place
was
full
*NL*
of
the
smoke
of
my
own
firing
,
just
as
my
ears
seemed
to
be
burst
with
*NL*
the
noise
of
the
shots
.
But
there
was
Alan
,
standing
as
before
;
only
*NL*
now
his
sword
was
running
blood
to
the
hilt
,
and
himself
so
swelled
*NL*
with
triumph
and
fallen
into
so
fine
an
attitude
,
that
he
looked
to
be
*NL*
invincible
.
Right
before
him
on
the
floor
was
Mr.
Shuan
,
on
his
hands
*NL*
and
knees
;
the
blood
was
pouring
from
his
mouth
,
and
he
was
sinking
*NL*
slowly
lower
,
with
a
terrible
,
white
face
;
and
just
as
I
looked
,
some
of
*NL*
those
from
behind
caught
hold
of
him
by
the
heels
and
dragged
him
bodily
*NL*
out
of
the
round-house
.
I
believe
he
died
as
they
were
doing
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
one
of
your
Whigs
for
ye
!
''
cried
Alan
;
and
then
turning
to
me
,
*NL*
he
asked
if
I
had
done
much
execution
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
I
had
winged
one
,
and
thought
it
was
the
captain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
've
settled
two
,
''
says
he
.
``
No
,
there
's
not
enough
blood
let
;
*NL*
they
'll
be
back
again
.
To
your
watch
,
David
.
This
was
but
a
dram
before
*NL*
meat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
settled
back
to
my
place
,
re-charging
the
three
pistols
I
had
fired
,
*NL*
and
keeping
watch
with
both
eye
and
ear
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
enemies
were
disputing
not
far
off
upon
the
deck
,
and
that
so
loudly
*NL*
that
I
could
hear
a
word
or
two
above
the
washing
of
the
seas
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
Shuan
bauchled
*
it
,
''
I
heard
one
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
Bungled
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
another
answered
him
with
a
``
Wheesht
,
man
!
He
's
paid
the
piper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
that
the
voices
fell
again
into
the
same
muttering
as
before
.
Only
*NL*
now
,
one
person
spoke
most
of
the
time
,
as
though
laying
down
a
plan
,
*NL*
and
first
one
and
then
another
answered
him
briefly
,
like
men
taking
*NL*
orders
.
By
this
,
I
made
sure
they
were
coming
on
again
,
and
told
Alan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
what
we
have
to
pray
for
,
''
said
he
.
``
Unless
we
can
give
them
a
*NL*
good
distaste
of
us
,
and
done
with
it
,
there
'll
be
nae
sleep
for
either
*NL*
you
or
me
.
But
this
time
,
mind
,
they
'll
be
in
earnest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
,
my
pistols
were
ready
,
and
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
listen
*NL*
and
wait
.
While
the
brush
lasted
,
I
had
not
the
time
to
think
if
I
was
*NL*
frighted
;
but
now
,
when
all
was
still
again
,
my
mind
ran
upon
nothing
*NL*
else
.
The
thought
of
the
sharp
swords
and
the
cold
steel
was
strong
in
*NL*
me
;
and
presently
,
when
I
began
to
hear
stealthy
steps
and
a
brushing
*NL*
of
men
's
clothes
against
the
round-house
wall
,
and
knew
they
were
taking
*NL*
their
places
in
the
dark
,
I
could
have
found
it
in
my
mind
to
cry
out
*NL*
aloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
was
upon
Alan
's
side
;
and
I
had
begun
to
think
my
share
of
the
*NL*
fight
was
at
an
end
,
when
I
heard
some
one
drop
softly
on
the
roof
above
*NL*
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
there
came
a
single
call
on
the
sea-pipe
,
and
that
was
the
signal
.
*NL*
A
knot
of
them
made
one
rush
of
it
,
cutlass
in
hand
,
against
the
door
;
*NL*
and
at
the
same
moment
,
the
glass
of
the
skylight
was
dashed
in
a
*NL*
thousand
pieces
,
and
a
man
leaped
through
and
landed
on
the
floor
.
*NL*
Before
he
got
his
feet
,
I
had
clapped
a
pistol
to
his
back
,
and
might
*NL*
have
shot
him
,
too
;
only
at
the
touch
of
him
-LRB-
and
him
alive
-RRB-
my
whole
*NL*
flesh
misgave
me
,
and
I
could
no
more
pull
the
trigger
than
I
could
have
*NL*
flown
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
dropped
his
cutlass
as
he
jumped
,
and
when
he
felt
the
pistol
,
*NL*
whipped
straight
round
and
laid
hold
of
me
,
roaring
out
an
oath
;
and
at
*NL*
that
either
my
courage
came
again
,
or
I
grew
so
much
afraid
as
came
to
*NL*
the
same
thing
;
for
I
gave
a
shriek
and
shot
him
in
the
midst
of
the
*NL*
body
.
He
gave
the
most
horrible
,
ugly
groan
and
fell
to
the
floor
.
The
*NL*
foot
of
a
second
fellow
,
whose
legs
were
dangling
through
the
skylight
,
*NL*
struck
me
at
the
same
time
upon
the
head
;
and
at
that
I
snatched
another
*NL*
pistol
and
shot
this
one
through
the
thigh
,
so
that
he
slipped
through
*NL*
and
tumbled
in
a
lump
on
his
companion
's
body
.
There
was
no
talk
of
*NL*
missing
,
any
more
than
there
was
time
to
aim
;
I
clapped
the
muzzle
to
*NL*
the
very
place
and
fired
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
might
have
stood
and
stared
at
them
for
long
,
but
I
heard
Alan
shout
*NL*
as
if
for
help
,
and
that
brought
me
to
my
senses
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
kept
the
door
so
long
;
but
one
of
the
seamen
,
while
he
was
*NL*
engaged
with
others
,
had
run
in
under
his
guard
and
caught
him
about
the
*NL*
body
.
Alan
was
dirking
him
with
his
left
hand
,
but
the
fellow
clung
like
*NL*
a
leech
.
Another
had
broken
in
and
had
his
cutlass
raised
.
The
door
was
*NL*
thronged
with
their
faces
.
I
thought
we
were
lost
,
and
catching
up
my
*NL*
cutlass
,
fell
on
them
in
flank
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
had
not
time
to
be
of
help
.
The
wrestler
dropped
at
last
;
and
*NL*
Alan
,
leaping
back
to
get
his
distance
,
ran
upon
the
others
like
a
*NL*
bull
,
roaring
as
he
went
.
They
broke
before
him
like
water
,
turning
,
and
*NL*
running
,
and
falling
one
against
another
in
their
haste
.
The
sword
*NL*
in
his
hands
flashed
like
quicksilver
into
the
huddle
of
our
fleeing
*NL*
enemies
;
and
at
every
flash
there
came
the
scream
of
a
man
hurt
.
I
was
*NL*
still
thinking
we
were
lost
,
when
lo
!
they
were
all
gone
,
and
Alan
was
*NL*
driving
them
along
the
deck
as
a
sheep-dog
chases
sheep
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
he
was
no
sooner
out
than
he
was
back
again
,
being
as
cautious
as
he
*NL*
was
brave
;
and
meanwhile
the
seamen
continued
running
and
crying
out
as
*NL*
if
he
was
still
behind
them
;
and
we
heard
them
tumble
one
upon
another
*NL*
into
the
forecastle
,
and
clap-to
the
hatch
upon
the
top
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
round-house
was
like
a
shambles
;
three
were
dead
inside
,
another
*NL*
lay
in
his
death
agony
across
the
threshold
;
and
there
were
Alan
and
I
*NL*
victorious
and
unhurt
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
up
to
me
with
open
arms
.
``
Come
to
my
arms
!
''
he
cried
,
and
*NL*
embraced
and
kissed
me
hard
upon
both
cheeks
.
``
David
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
love
*NL*
you
like
a
brother
.
And
O
,
man
,
''
he
cried
in
a
kind
of
ecstasy
,
``
am
I
no
*NL*
a
bonny
fighter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thereupon
he
turned
to
the
four
enemies
,
passed
his
sword
clean
through
*NL*
each
of
them
,
and
tumbled
them
out
of
doors
one
after
the
other
.
As
he
*NL*
did
so
,
he
kept
humming
and
singing
and
whistling
to
himself
,
like
a
man
*NL*
trying
to
recall
an
air
;
only
what
HE
was
trying
was
to
make
one
.
All
*NL*
the
while
,
the
flush
was
in
his
face
,
and
his
eyes
were
as
bright
as
a
*NL*
five-year-old
child
's
with
a
new
toy
.
And
presently
he
sat
down
upon
the
*NL*
table
,
sword
in
hand
;
the
air
that
he
was
making
all
the
time
began
to
*NL*
run
a
little
clearer
,
and
then
clearer
still
;
and
then
out
he
burst
with
*NL*
a
great
voice
into
a
Gaelic
song
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
translated
it
here
,
not
in
verse
-LRB-
of
which
I
have
no
skill
-RRB-
but
*NL*
at
least
in
the
king
's
English
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sang
it
often
afterwards
,
and
the
thing
became
popular
;
so
that
I
*NL*
have
heard
it
and
had
it
explained
to
me
,
many
's
the
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
the
song
of
the
sword
of
Alan
;
The
smith
made
it
,
The
fire
set
*NL*
it
;
Now
it
shines
in
the
hand
of
Alan
Breck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Their
eyes
were
many
and
bright
,
Swift
were
they
to
behold
,
Many
the
*NL*
hands
they
guided
:
The
sword
was
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
dun
deer
troop
over
the
hill
,
They
are
many
,
the
hill
is
one
;
The
*NL*
dun
deer
vanish
,
The
hill
remains
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
to
me
from
the
hills
of
heather
,
Come
from
the
isles
of
the
sea
.
O
*NL*
far-beholding
eagles
,
Here
is
your
meat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Now
this
song
which
he
made
-LRB-
both
words
and
music
-RRB-
in
the
hour
of
our
*NL*
victory
,
is
something
less
than
just
to
me
,
who
stood
beside
him
in
*NL*
the
tussle
.
Mr.
Shuan
and
five
more
were
either
killed
outright
or
*NL*
thoroughly
disabled
;
but
of
these
,
two
fell
by
my
hand
,
the
two
that
*NL*
came
by
the
skylight
.
Four
more
were
hurt
,
and
of
that
number
,
one
-LRB-
and
*NL*
he
not
the
least
important
-RRB-
got
his
hurt
from
me
.
So
that
,
altogether
,
*NL*
I
did
my
fair
share
both
of
the
killing
and
the
wounding
,
and
might
have
*NL*
claimed
a
place
in
Alan
's
verses
.
But
poets
have
to
think
upon
their
*NL*
rhymes
;
and
in
good
prose
talk
,
Alan
always
did
me
more
than
justice
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meanwhile
,
I
was
innocent
of
any
wrong
being
done
me
.
For
not
*NL*
only
I
knew
no
word
of
the
Gaelic
;
but
what
with
the
long
suspense
of
*NL*
the
waiting
,
and
the
scurry
and
strain
of
our
two
spirts
of
fighting
,
*NL*
and
more
than
all
,
the
horror
I
had
of
some
of
my
own
share
in
it
,
the
*NL*
thing
was
no
sooner
over
than
I
was
glad
to
stagger
to
a
seat
.
There
was
*NL*
that
tightness
on
my
chest
that
I
could
hardly
breathe
;
the
thought
*NL*
of
the
two
men
I
had
shot
sat
upon
me
like
a
nightmare
;
and
all
upon
a
*NL*
sudden
,
and
before
I
had
a
guess
of
what
was
coming
,
I
began
to
sob
and
*NL*
cry
like
any
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alan
clapped
my
shoulder
,
and
said
I
was
a
brave
lad
and
wanted
nothing
*NL*
but
a
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
take
the
first
watch
,
''
said
he
.
``
Ye
've
done
well
by
me
,
David
,
*NL*
first
and
last
;
and
I
would
n't
lose
you
for
all
Appin
--
no
,
nor
for
*NL*
Breadalbane
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
I
made
up
my
bed
on
the
floor
;
and
he
took
the
first
spell
,
pistol
*NL*
in
hand
and
sword
on
knee
,
three
hours
by
the
captain
's
watch
upon
the
*NL*
wall
.
Then
he
roused
me
up
,
and
I
took
my
turn
of
three
hours
;
before
*NL*
the
end
of
which
it
was
broad
day
,
and
a
very
quiet
morning
,
with
a
*NL*
smooth
,
rolling
sea
that
tossed
the
ship
and
made
the
blood
run
to
and
*NL*
fro
on
the
round-house
floor
,
and
a
heavy
rain
that
drummed
upon
the
*NL*
roof
.
All
my
watch
there
was
nothing
stirring
;
and
by
the
banging
of
the
*NL*
helm
,
I
knew
they
had
even
no
one
at
the
tiller
.
Indeed
-LRB-
as
I
learned
*NL*
afterwards
-RRB-
there
were
so
many
of
them
hurt
or
dead
,
and
the
rest
in
so
*NL*
ill
a
temper
,
that
Mr.
Riach
and
the
captain
had
to
take
turn
and
turn
*NL*
like
Alan
and
me
,
or
the
brig
might
have
gone
ashore
and
nobody
the
*NL*
wiser
.
It
was
a
mercy
the
night
had
fallen
so
still
,
for
the
wind
had
*NL*
gone
down
as
soon
as
the
rain
began
.
Even
as
it
was
,
I
judged
by
the
*NL*
wailing
of
a
great
number
of
gulls
that
went
crying
and
fishing
round
*NL*
the
ship
,
that
she
must
have
drifted
pretty
near
the
coast
or
one
of
*NL*
the
islands
of
the
Hebrides
;
and
at
last
,
looking
out
of
the
door
of
the
*NL*
round-house
,
I
saw
the
great
stone
hills
of
Skye
on
the
right
hand
,
and
,
*NL*
a
little
more
astern
,
the
strange
isle
of
Rum
.

CHAPTER
XI
*NL*
*NL*
THE
CAPTAIN
KNUCKLES
UNDER
*NL*
*NL*
Alan
and
I
sat
down
to
breakfast
about
six
of
the
clock
.
The
floor
was
*NL*
covered
with
broken
glass
and
in
a
horrid
mess
of
blood
,
which
took
away
*NL*
my
hunger
.
In
all
other
ways
we
were
in
a
situation
not
only
agreeable
*NL*
but
merry
;
having
ousted
the
officers
from
their
own
cabin
,
and
having
*NL*
at
command
all
the
drink
in
the
ship
--
both
wine
and
spirits
--
and
all
the
*NL*
dainty
part
of
what
was
eatable
,
such
as
the
pickles
and
the
fine
sort
*NL*
of
bread
.
This
,
of
itself
,
was
enough
to
set
us
in
good
humour
,
but
the
*NL*
richest
part
of
it
was
this
,
that
the
two
thirstiest
men
that
ever
came
*NL*
out
of
Scotland
-LRB-
Mr.
Shuan
being
dead
-RRB-
were
now
shut
in
the
fore-part
of
*NL*
the
ship
and
condemned
to
what
they
hated
most
--
cold
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
depend
upon
it
,
''
Alan
said
,
``
we
shall
hear
more
of
them
ere
long
.
*NL*
Ye
may
keep
a
man
from
the
fighting
,
but
never
from
his
bottle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
made
good
company
for
each
other
.
Alan
,
indeed
,
expressed
himself
*NL*
most
lovingly
;
and
taking
a
knife
from
the
table
,
cut
me
off
one
of
the
*NL*
silver
buttons
from
his
coat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
them
,
''
says
he
,
``
from
my
father
,
Duncan
Stewart
;
and
now
give
ye
*NL*
one
of
them
to
be
a
keepsake
for
last
night
's
work
.
And
wherever
ye
go
*NL*
and
show
that
button
,
the
friends
of
Alan
Breck
will
come
around
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
this
as
if
he
had
been
Charlemagne
,
and
commanded
armies
;
and
*NL*
indeed
,
much
as
I
admired
his
courage
,
I
was
always
in
danger
of
smiling
*NL*
at
his
vanity
:
in
danger
,
I
say
,
for
had
I
not
kept
my
countenance
,
I
*NL*
would
be
afraid
to
think
what
a
quarrel
might
have
followed
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
we
were
through
with
our
meal
he
rummaged
in
the
captain
's
*NL*
locker
till
he
found
a
clothes-brush
;
and
then
taking
off
his
coat
,
*NL*
began
to
visit
his
suit
and
brush
away
the
stains
,
with
such
care
and
*NL*
labour
as
I
supposed
to
have
been
only
usual
with
women
.
To
be
sure
,
he
*NL*
had
no
other
;
and
,
besides
-LRB-
as
he
said
-RRB-
,
it
belonged
to
a
king
and
so
*NL*
behoved
to
be
royally
looked
after
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
all
that
,
when
I
saw
what
care
he
took
to
pluck
out
the
threads
*NL*
where
the
button
had
been
cut
away
,
I
put
a
higher
value
on
his
gift
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
still
so
engaged
when
we
were
hailed
by
Mr.
Riach
from
the
deck
,
*NL*
asking
for
a
parley
;
and
I
,
climbing
through
the
skylight
and
sitting
on
*NL*
the
edge
of
it
,
pistol
in
hand
and
with
a
bold
front
,
though
inwardly
in
*NL*
fear
of
broken
glass
,
hailed
him
back
again
and
bade
him
speak
out
.
He
*NL*
came
to
the
edge
of
the
round-house
,
and
stood
on
a
coil
of
rope
,
so
*NL*
that
his
chin
was
on
a
level
with
the
roof
;
and
we
looked
at
each
other
*NL*
awhile
in
silence
.
Mr.
Riach
,
as
I
do
not
think
he
had
been
very
forward
*NL*
in
the
battle
,
so
he
had
got
off
with
nothing
worse
than
a
blow
upon
the
*NL*
cheek
:
but
he
looked
out
of
heart
and
very
weary
,
having
been
all
night
*NL*
afoot
,
either
standing
watch
or
doctoring
the
wounded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
a
bad
job
,
''
said
he
at
last
,
shaking
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
none
of
our
choosing
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
captain
,
''
says
he
,
``
would
like
to
speak
with
your
friend
.
They
*NL*
might
speak
at
the
window
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
do
we
know
what
treachery
he
means
?
''
cried
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
means
none
,
David
,
''
returned
Mr.
Riach
,
``
and
if
he
did
,
I
'll
tell
ye
*NL*
the
honest
truth
,
we
couldnae
get
the
men
to
follow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
so
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
ye
more
than
that
,
''
said
he
.
``
It
's
not
only
the
men
;
it
's
me
.
*NL*
I
'm
frich
`
ened
,
Davie
.
''
And
he
smiled
across
at
me
.
``
No
,
''
he
continued
,
*NL*
``
what
we
want
is
to
be
shut
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thereupon
I
consulted
with
Alan
,
and
the
parley
was
agreed
to
and
*NL*
parole
given
upon
either
side
;
but
this
was
not
the
whole
of
Mr.
Riach
's
*NL*
business
,
and
he
now
begged
me
for
a
dram
with
such
instancy
and
such
*NL*
reminders
of
his
former
kindness
,
that
at
last
I
handed
him
a
pannikin
*NL*
with
about
a
gill
of
brandy
.
He
drank
a
part
,
and
then
carried
the
rest
*NL*
down
upon
the
deck
,
to
share
it
-LRB-
I
suppose
-RRB-
with
his
superior
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
little
after
,
the
captain
came
-LRB-
as
was
agreed
-RRB-
to
one
of
the
windows
,
*NL*
and
stood
there
in
the
rain
,
with
his
arm
in
a
sling
,
and
looking
stern
*NL*
and
pale
,
and
so
old
that
my
heart
smote
me
for
having
fired
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alan
at
once
held
a
pistol
in
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Put
that
thing
up
!
''
said
the
captain
.
``
Have
I
not
passed
my
word
,
sir
?
*NL*
or
do
ye
seek
to
affront
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Captain
,
''
says
Alan
,
``
I
doubt
your
word
is
a
breakable
.
Last
night
ye
*NL*
haggled
and
argle-bargled
like
an
apple-wife
;
and
then
passed

gave
me
your
hand
to
back
it

ye
ken
very
well
what
was
*NL*
the
upshot
.
Be
damned
to
your
word
!
''
says
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
sir
,
''
said
the
captain
,
``
ye
'll
get
little
good
by
*NL*
swearing
.

-LRB-
And
truly
that
was
a
fault
of
which
the
captain
was
quite
*NL*
free
.
-RRB-
``
But
we
have
other
things
to
speak
,
''
he
continued
,
bitterly
.
*NL*
``
Ye
've
made
a
sore
hash
of
my
brig

I
have
n't

enough
left
to

my
first
officer
-LRB-

I
could
ill
spare
-RRB-
has
got
your
sword
*NL*
throughout
his
vitals
,
and
passed
without
speech
.
There
is
nothing
left
*NL*
me
,
sir
,
but
to
put
back
into
the
port
of
Glasgow
after
hands
;

there
*NL*

by
your
leave
-RRB-

will
find

better
able

you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
?

said
Alan
;
``
and
faith

I
'll
have
a

*NL*

No

Alan
,

no

just
have

agreed

*NL*
``

said
Hoseason
,

There
's
none

it

one
very
dangerous
to

*NL*
``

*NL*
That
was
the
last
clause

was
duly
executed
on

so
that
Alan

at

wash
out
the
round-house

be
*NL*
quit
of
the
memorials
of
those
whom
we
had
slain

CHAPTER
XII
*NL*
*NL*
I
HEAR
OF
THE
``
RED
FOX
''
*NL*
*NL*
Before
we
had
done
cleaning
out
the
round-house
,
a
breeze
sprang
up
from
*NL*
a
little
to
the
east
of
north
.
This
blew
off
the
rain
and
brought
out
*NL*
the
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
here
I
must
explain
;
and
the
reader
would
do
well
to
look
at
a
map
.
*NL*
On
the
day
when
the
fog
fell
and
we
ran
down
Alan
's
boat
,
we
had
been
*NL*
running
through
the
Little
Minch
.
At
dawn
after
the
battle
,
we
lay
*NL*
becalmed
to
the
east
of
the
Isle
of
Canna
or
between
that
and
Isle
*NL*
Eriska
in
the
chain
of
the
Long
Island
.
Now
to
get
from
there
to
the
*NL*
Linnhe
Loch
,
the
straight
course
was
through
the
narrows
of
the
Sound
of
*NL*
Mull
.
But
the
captain
had
no
chart
;
he
was
afraid
to
trust
his
brig
so
*NL*
deep
among
the
islands
;
and
the
wind
serving
well
,
he
preferred
to
go
by
*NL*
west
of
Tiree
and
come
up
under
the
southern
coast
of
the
great
Isle
of
*NL*
Mull
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
day
the
breeze
held
in
the
same
point
,
and
rather
freshened
than
*NL*
died
down
;
and
towards
afternoon
,
a
swell
began
to
set
in
from
round
the
*NL*
outer
Hebrides
.
Our
course
,
to
go
round
about
the
inner
isles
,
was
to
*NL*
the
west
of
south
,
so
that
at
first
we
had
this
swell
upon
our
beam
,
and
*NL*
were
much
rolled
about
.
But
after
nightfall
,
when
we
had
turned
the
end
*NL*
of
Tiree
and
began
to
head
more
to
the
east
,
the
sea
came
right
astern
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
the
early
part
of
the
day
,
before
the
swell
came
up
,
was
*NL*
very
pleasant
;
sailing
,
as
we
were
,
in
a
bright
sunshine
and
with
*NL*
many
mountainous
islands
upon
different
sides
.
Alan
and
I
sat
in
the
*NL*
round-house
with
the
doors
open
on
each
side
-LRB-
the
wind
being
straight
*NL*
astern
-RRB-
,
and
smoked
a
pipe
or
two
of
the
captain
's
fine
tobacco
.
It
was
*NL*
at
this
time
we
heard
each
other
's
stories
,
which
was
the
more
important
*NL*
to
me
,
as
I
gained
some
knowledge
of
that
wild
Highland
country
on
which
*NL*
I
was
so
soon
to
land
.
In
those
days
,
so
close
on
the
back
of
the
great
*NL*
rebellion
,
it
was
needful
a
man
should
know
what
he
was
doing
when
he
*NL*
went
upon
the
heather
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
I
that
showed
the
example
,
telling
him
all
my
misfortune
;
which
*NL*
he
heard
with
great
good-nature
.
Only
,
when
I
came
to
mention
that
good
*NL*
friend
of
mine
,
Mr.
Campbell
the
minister
,
Alan
fired
up
and
cried
out
*NL*
that
he
hated
all
that
were
of
that
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
''
said
I
,
``
he
is
a
man
you
should
be
proud
to
give
your
hand
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
nothing
I
would
help
a
Campbell
to
,
''
says
he
,
``
unless
it
was
a
*NL*
leaden
bullet
.
I
would
hunt
all
of
that
name
like
blackcocks
.
If
I
lay
*NL*
dying
,
I
would
crawl
upon
my
knees
to
my
chamber
window
for
a
shot
at
*NL*
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Alan
,
''
I
cried
,
``
what
ails
ye
at
the
Campbells
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
says
he
,
``
ye
ken
very
well
that
I
am
an
Appin
Stewart
,
and
the
*NL*
Campbells
have
long
harried
and
wasted
those
of
my
name
;
ay
,
and
got
*NL*
lands
of
us
by
treachery
--
but
never
with
the
sword
,
''
he
cried
loudly
,
*NL*
and
with
the
word
brought
down
his
fist
upon
the
table
.
But
I
paid
the
*NL*
less
attention
to
this
,
for
I
knew
it
was
usually
said
by
those
who
have
*NL*
the
underhand
.
``
There
's
more
than
that
,
''
he
continued
,
``
and
all
in
the
*NL*
same
story
:
lying
words
,
lying
papers
,
tricks
fit
for
a
peddler
,
and
the
*NL*
show
of
what
's
legal
over
all
,
to
make
a
man
the
more
angry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
that
are
so
wasteful
of
your
buttons
,
''
said
I
,
``
I
can
hardly
think
*NL*
you
would
be
a
good
judge
of
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
says
he
,
falling
again
to
smiling
,
``
I
got
my
wastefulness
from
*NL*
the
same
man
I
got
the
buttons
from
;
and
that
was
my
poor
father
,
Duncan
*NL*
Stewart
,
grace
be
to
him
!
He
was
the
prettiest
man
of
his
kindred
;
and
*NL*
the
best
swordsman
in
the
Hielands
,
David
,
and
that
is
the
same
as
to
*NL*
say
,
in
all
the
world
,
I
should
ken
,
for
it
was
him
that
taught
me
.
*NL*
He
was
in
the
Black
Watch
,
when
first
it
was
mustered
;
and
,
like
other
*NL*
gentlemen
privates
,
had
a
gillie
at
his
back
to
carry
his
firelock
for
*NL*
him
on
the
march
.
Well
,
the
King
,
it
appears
,
was
wishful
to
see
Hieland
*NL*
swordsmanship
;
and
my
father
and
three
more
were
chosen
out
and
sent
to
*NL*
London
town
,
to
let
him
see
it
at
the
best
.
So
they
were
had
into
the
*NL*
palace
and
showed
the
whole
art
of
the
sword
for
two
hours
at
a
stretch
,
*NL*
before
King
George
and
Queen
Carline
,
and
the
Butcher
Cumberland
,
and
*NL*
many
more
of
whom
I
havenae
mind
.
And
when
they
were
through
,
the
King
*NL*
-LRB-
for
all
he
was
a
rank
usurper
-RRB-
spoke
them
fair
and
gave
each
man
three
*NL*
guineas
in
his
hand
.
Now
,
as
they
were
going
out
of
the
palace
,
they
*NL*
had
a
porter
's
lodge
to
go
by
;
and
it
came
in
on
my
father
,
as
he
was
*NL*
perhaps
the
first
private
Hieland
gentleman
that
had
ever
gone
by
that
*NL*
door
,
it
was
right
he
should
give
the
poor
porter
a
proper
notion
of
*NL*
their
quality
.
So
he
gives
the
King
's
three
guineas
into
the
man
's
hand
,
*NL*
as
if
it
was
his
common
custom
;
the
three
others
that
came
behind
him
*NL*
did
the
same
;
and
there
they
were
on
the
street
,
never
a
penny
the
*NL*
better
for
their
pains
.
Some
say
it
was
one
,
that
was
the
first
to
fee
*NL*
the
King
's
porter
;
and
some
say
it
was
another
;
but
the
truth
of
it
is
,
*NL*
that
it
was
Duncan
Stewart
,
as
I
am
willing
to
prove
with
either
sword
*NL*
or
pistol
.
And
that
was
the
father
that
I
had
,
God
rest
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
he
was
not
the
man
to
leave
you
rich
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
's
true
,
''
said
Alan
.
``
He
left
me
my
breeks
to
cover
me
,
and
*NL*
little
besides
.
And
that
was
how
I
came
to
enlist
,
which
was
a
black
*NL*
spot
upon
my
character
at
the
best
of
times
,
and
would
still
be
a
sore
*NL*
job
for
me
if
I
fell
among
the
red-coats
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
''
cried
I
,
``
were
you
in
the
English
army
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
I
,
''
said
Alan
.
``
But
I
deserted
to
the
right
side
at
Preston
*NL*
Pans
--
and
that
's
some
comfort
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
scarcely
share
this
view
:
holding
desertion
under
arms
for
an
*NL*
unpardonable
fault
in
honour
.
But
for
all
I
was
so
young
,
I
was
wiser
*NL*
than
say
my
thought
.
``
Dear
,
dear
,
''
says
I
,
``

it
would

*NL*

nae

I
weary

*NL*
then
I
have
bit
things
that
I
attend
to

Whiles
I
pick
up
a
few
lads
*NL*
to
serve
the
King
of
France
:
recruits
,
ye
see
;
and
that
's
aye
a
*NL*
little
money
.
But
the
heart
of
the
matter
is
the
business
of
my
chief
,
*NL*
Ardshiel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
they
called
your

Appin

said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
but
Ardshiel
is
the
captain
of
the
clan

''
said
he
,
which
scarcely
*NL*
cleared
my
mind
.
``
Ye
see
,
David
,
he
that
was
all
his
life
so
great
a
*NL*
man
,
and
come
of
the
blood
and
bearing
the
name
of
kings
,
is
now
brought
*NL*
down
to
live
in
a
French
town
like
a
poor
and
private
person
.
He
that
*NL*
had
four
hundred
swords
at
his
whistle
,
I
have
seen
,
with
these
eyes
*NL*
of
mine
,
buying
butter
in
the
market-place
,
and
taking
it
home
in
a
*NL*
kale-leaf
.
This
is
not
only
a
pain
but
a
disgrace
to
us
of
his
family
*NL*
and
clan
.
There
are
the
bairns
forby
,
the
children
and
the
hope
of
*NL*
Appin
,
that
must
be
learned
their
letters
and
how
to
hold
a
sword
,
in
*NL*
that
far
country
.
Now
,
the
tenants
of
Appin
have
to
pay
a
rent
to
King
*NL*
George
;
but
their
hearts
are
staunch
,
they
are
true
to
their
chief
;
and
*NL*
what
with
love
and
a
bit
of
pressure
,
and
maybe
a
threat
or
two
,
the
*NL*
poor
folk
scrape
up
a
second
rent
for
Ardshiel
.
Well
,
David
,
I
'm
the
*NL*
hand
that
carries
it
.
''
And
he
struck
the
belt
about
his
body
,
so
that
*NL*
the
guineas
rang
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
they
pay
both
?
''
cried
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay

David
,
both
,
''
says
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What

two
rents
?
''
I
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay

David

said
he

``
I
told
a
different

this
is
the
truth

And
it
's
wonderful
to
me
how
little
pressure
*NL*
is
needed
.
But
that
's
the
handiwork
of
my
good
kinsman
and
my
father

*NL*
friend
,
James
of
the
Glens
:
James
Stewart
,
that
is
:
Ardshiel
's
*NL*
half-brother
.
He
it
is
that
gets
the
money
in
,
and
does
the
management
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
first
time
I
heard
the
name
of
that
James
Stewart
,
who
was
*NL*
afterwards
so
famous
at
the
time
of
his
hanging
.
But
I
took
little
heed
*NL*
at
the
moment
,
for
all
my
mind
was
occupied
with
the
generosity
of
these
*NL*
poor
Highlanders
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
call
it
noble
,
''
I
cried
.
``
I
'm
a
Whig
,
or
little
better
;
but
I
call
it
*NL*
noble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
''
said
he
,
``
ye
're
a
Whig
,
but
ye
're
a
gentleman
;
and
that
's
what
does
*NL*
it
.
Now
,
if
ye
were
one
of
the
cursed
race
of
Campbell
,
ye
would
gnash
*NL*
your
teeth
to
hear
tell
of
it
.
If
ye
were
the
Red
Fox
...
''
And
at
that
*NL*
name
,
his
teeth
shut
together
,
and
he
ceased
speaking
.
I
have
seen
many
*NL*
a
grim
face
,
but
never
a
grimmer
than
Alan
's
when
he
had
named
the
Red
*NL*
Fox
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
is
the
Red
Fox
?
''
I
asked
,
daunted
,
but
still
curious
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
he
?
''
cried
Alan
.
``
Well
,
and
I
'll
tell
you
that
.
When
the
men
of
*NL*
the
clans
were
broken
at
Culloden
,
and
the
good
cause
went
down
,
and
the
*NL*
horses
rode
over
the
fetlocks
in
the
best
blood
of
the
north
,
Ardshiel
*NL*
had
to
flee
like
a
poor
deer
upon
the
mountains
--
he
and
his
lady
and
his
*NL*
bairns
.
A
sair
job
we
had
of
it
before
we
got
him
shipped
;
and
while
he
*NL*
still
lay
in
the
heather
,
the
English
rogues
,
that
couldnae
come
at
his
*NL*
life
,
were
striking
at
his
rights
.
They
stripped
him
of
his
powers
;
they
*NL*
stripped
him
of
his
lands
;
they
plucked
the
weapons
from
the
hands
of
*NL*
his
clansmen
,
that
had
borne
arms
for
thirty
centuries
;
ay
,
and
the
very
*NL*
clothes
off
their
backs
--
so
that
it
's
now
a
sin
to
wear
a
tartan
plaid
,
*NL*
and
a
man
may
be
cast
into
a
gaol
if
he
has
but
a
kilt
about
his
legs
.
*NL*
One
thing
they
couldnae
kill
.
That
was
the
love
the
clansmen
bore
their
*NL*
chief
.
These
guineas
are
the
proof
of
it
.
And
now
,
in
there
steps
a
man
,
*NL*
a
Campbell
,
red-headed
Colin
of
Glenure
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
him
you
call
the
Red
Fox
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
ye
bring
me
his
brush
?
''
cries
Alan
,
fiercely
.
``
Ay
,
that
's
the
man
.
*NL*
In
he
steps
,
and
gets
papers
from
King
George
,
to
be
so-called
King
's
*NL*
factor
on
the
lands
of
Appin
.
And
at
first
he
sings
small

is
*NL*
hail-fellow-well-met
with
Sheamus
--
that
's
James
of
the
Glens

my
*NL*
chieftain

agent

But
by-and-by
,
that
came
to
his
ears
that
I
have
just
*NL*
told
you
;
how
the
poor
commons
of
Appin
,
the
farmers
and
the
crofters
*NL*
and
the
boumen
,
were
wringing
their
very
plaids
to
get
a
second
rent
,
*NL*
and
send
it
over-seas
for
Ardshiel
and
his
poor
bairns

What
was
it
ye
*NL*
called
it
,
when
I
told
ye

*NL*

I
called

said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``

you
little
better

cries
Alan
.
``
But
when
it
*NL*
came
to
Colin
Roy

the
black
Campbell
blood
in

ran
wild

He
sat

gnashing
his
teeth
at
the
wine
table

What

get
a
bite

down

*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
Alan
laid
down
his
pipe
,
which
he
had
long
since
suffered
to
go
out

*NL*
set
his
two
hands
upon

*NL*

Ardshiel
was
to

starve

that
was
the
thing
he
aimed
at

And
since
them

him
in

his

wouldnae
be
bought
out

right

he
would
drive

Therefore
he
sent

And
the

there
was
so
much
anger
under
his

that
I
thought
it
was
wise
to
change
the

I
expressed
my
*NL*
wonder
how
,
with
the
Highlands
covered
with
troops
,
and
guarded
like
*NL*
a
city
in
a
siege

a
man
in

go
without

arrest

*NL*
*NL*
``
It

easier

''
said
Alan

``
A
bare
hillside
-LRB-
ye
see

is
like
all
one
road
;
if
there
's
a
sentry
at
one
place
,
ye
just
go
by
*NL*
another
.
And
then
the
heather
's
a
great
help
.
And
everywhere
there
are
*NL*
friends
'
houses
and
friends
'
byres
and
haystacks
.
And
besides
,
when
folk
*NL*
talk
of
a
country
covered
with
troops
,
it
's
but
a
kind
of
a
byword
at
*NL*
the
best
.
A
soldier
covers
nae
mair
of
it
than
his
boot-soles

I
have
*NL*
fished
a
water
with
a
sentry
on
the

killed
a

and
I
have
sat
in
a
heather
bush
within
six
feet
of
another
,
*NL*
and
learned
a
real
bonny
tune
from
his
whistling
.
This
was
it
,
''
said
he
,
*NL*
and
whistled
me
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then
,
besides
,
''
he
continued
,
``
it
's
no
sae
bad
now
as
it
was
in
*NL*
forty-six
.
The
Hielands
are
what
they
call
pacified
.
Small
wonder
,
with
*NL*
never
a
gun
or
a
sword
left
from
Cantyre
to
Cape
Wrath
,
but
what
tenty
*
*NL*
folk
have
hidden
in
their
thatch
!
But
what
I
would
like
to
ken
,
David
,
*NL*
is
just
how
long
?
Not
long
,
ye
would
think
,
with
men
like
Ardshiel
in
*NL*
exile
and
men
like
the
Red
Fox
sitting
birling
the
wine
and
oppressing
*NL*
the
poor
at
home
.
But
it
's
a
kittle
thing
to
decide
what
folk
'll
bear
,
*NL*
and
what
they
will
not
.
Or
why
would
Red
Colin
be
riding
his
horse
all
*NL*
over
my
poor
country
of
Appin
,
and
never
a
pretty
lad
to
put
a
bullet
in
*NL*
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
*
Careful
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
with
this
Alan
fell
into
a
muse
,
and
for
a
long
time
sate
very
sad
*NL*
and
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
will
add
the
rest
of
what
I
have
to
say
about
my
friend
,
that
he
*NL*
was
skilled
in
all
kinds
of
music
,
but
principally
pipe-music
;
was
a
*NL*
well-considered
poet
in
his
own
tongue
;
had
read
several
books
both
in
*NL*
French
and
English
;
was
a
dead
shot
,
a
good
angler
,
and
an
excellent
*NL*
fencer
with
the
small
sword
as
well
as
with
his
own
particular
weapon
.
*NL*
For
his
faults
,
they
were
on
his
face
,
and
I
now
knew
them
all
.
But
*NL*
the
worst
of
them
,
his
childish
propensity
to
take
offence
and
to
pick
*NL*
quarrels
,
he
greatly
laid
aside
in
my
case
,
out
of
regard
for
the
battle
*NL*
of
the
round-house
.
But
whether
it
was
because
I
had
done
well
myself
,
*NL*
or
because
I
had
been
a
witness
of
his
own
much
greater
prowess
,
is
more
*NL*
than
I
can
tell
.
For
though
he
had
a
great
taste
for
courage
in
other
*NL*
men
,
yet
he
admired
it
most
in
Alan
Breck
.

CHAPTER
XIII
*NL*
*NL*
THE
LOSS
OF
THE
BRIG
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
already
late
at
night
,
and
as
dark
as
it
ever
would
be
at
that
*NL*
season
of
the
year
-LRB-
and
that
is
to
say
,
it
was
still
pretty
bright
-RRB-
,
*NL*
when
Hoseason
clapped
his
head
into
the
round-house
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
''
said
he
,
``
come
out
and
see
if
ye
can
pilot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
this
one
of
your
tricks
?
''
asked
Alan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
I
look
like
tricks
?
''
cries
the
captain
.
``
I
have
other
things
to
*NL*
think
of
--
my
brig
's
in
danger
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
concerned
look
of
his
face
,
and
,
above
all
,
by
the
sharp
tones
in
*NL*
which
he
spoke
of
his
brig
,
it
was
plain
to
both
of
us
he
was
in
deadly
*NL*
earnest
;
and
so
Alan
and
I
,
with
no
great
fear
of
treachery
,
stepped
on
*NL*
deck
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sky
was
clear
;
it
blew
hard
,
and
was
bitter
cold
;
a
great
deal
of
*NL*
daylight
lingered
;
and
the
moon
,
which
was
nearly
full
,
shone
brightly
.
*NL*
The
brig
was
close
hauled
,
so
as
to
round
the
southwest
corner
of
the
*NL*
Island
of
Mull
,
the
hills
of
which
-LRB-
and
Ben
More
above
them
all
,
with
a
*NL*
wisp
of
mist
upon
the
top
of
it
-RRB-
lay
full
upon
the
lar-board
bow
.
Though
*NL*
it
was
no
good
point
of
sailing
for
the
Covenant
,
she
tore
through
*NL*
the
seas
at
a
great
rate
,
pitching
and
straining
,
and
pursued
by
the
*NL*
westerly
swell
.
*NL*
*NL*
Altogether
it
was
no
such
ill
night
to
keep
the
seas
in
;
and
I
had
begun
*NL*
to
wonder
what
it
was
that
sat
so
heavily
upon
the
captain
,
when
the
*NL*
brig
rising
suddenly
on
the
top
of
a
high
swell
,
he
pointed
and
cried
to
*NL*
us
to
look
.
Away
on
the
lee
bow
,
a
thing
like
a
fountain
rose
out
of
the
*NL*
moonlit
sea
,
and
immediately
after
we
heard
a
low
sound
of
roaring
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
ye
call
that
?
''
asked
the
captain
,
gloomily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
sea
breaking
on
a
reef
,
''
said
Alan
.
``
And
now
ye
ken
where
it
is
;
*NL*
and
what
better
would
ye
have
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
''
said
Hoseason
,
``
if
it
was
the
only
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
sure
enough
,
just
as
he
spoke
there
came
a
second
fountain
farther
*NL*
to
the
south
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
!
''
said
Hoseason
.
``
Ye
see
for
yourself
.
If
I
had
kent
of
these
*NL*
reefs
,
if
I
had
had
a
chart
,
or
if
Shuan
had
been
spared
,
it
's
not
sixty
*NL*
guineas
,
no
,
nor
six
hundred
,
would
have
made
me
risk
my
brig
in
sic
a
*NL*
stoneyard
!
But
you
,
sir
,
that
was
to
pilot
us
,
have
ye
never
a
word
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
thinking
,
''
said
Alan
,
``
these
'll
be
what
they
call
the
Torran
*NL*
Rocks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
there
many
of
them
?
''
says
the
captain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Truly
,
sir
,
I
am
nae
pilot
,
''
said
Alan
;
``
but
it
sticks
in
my
mind
there
*NL*
are
ten
miles
of
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Riach
and
the
captain
looked
at
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
a
way
through
them
,
I
suppose
?
''
said
the
captain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doubtless
,
''
said
Alan
,
``
but
where
?
But
it
somehow
runs
in
my
mind
once
*NL*
more
that
it
is
clearer
under
the
land
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
?
''
said
Hoseason
.
``
We
'll
have
to
haul
our
wind
then
,
Mr.
Riach
;
we
'll
*NL*
have
to
come
as
near
in
about
the
end
of
Mull
as
we
can
take
her
,
sir
;
*NL*
and
even
then
we
'll
have
the
land
to
kep
the
wind
off
us
,
and
that
*NL*
stoneyard
on
our
lee
.
Well
,
we
're
in
for
it
now
,
and
may
as
well
crack
*NL*
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
that
he
gave
an
order
to
the
steersman
,
and
sent
Riach
to
the
*NL*
foretop
.
There
were
only
five
men
on
deck
,
counting
the
officers
;
these
*NL*
being
all
that
were
fit
-LRB-
or
,
at
least
,
both
fit
and
willing
-RRB-
for
their
*NL*
work
.
So
,
as
I
say
,
it
fell
to
Mr.
Riach
to
go
aloft
,
and
he
sat
there
*NL*
looking
out
and
hailing
the
deck
with
news
of
all
he
saw
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
sea
to
the
south
is
thick
,
''
he
cried
;
and
then
,
after
a
while
,
``
it
*NL*
does
seem
clearer
in
by
the
land
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
''
said
Hoseason
to
Alan
,
``
we
'll
try
your
way
of
it
.
But
I
*NL*
think
I
might
as
well
trust
to
a
blind
fiddler
.
Pray
God
you
're
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
God
I
am
!
''
says
Alan
to
me
.
``
But
where
did
I
hear
it
?
Well
,
well
,
*NL*
it
will
be
as
it
must
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
got
nearer
to
the
turn
of
the
land
the
reefs
began
to
be
sown
here
*NL*
and
there
on
our
very
path
;
and
Mr.
Riach
sometimes
cried
down
to
us
to
*NL*
change
the
course
.
Sometimes
,
indeed
,
none
too
soon
;
for
one
reef
was
*NL*
so
close
on
the
brig
's
weather
board
that
when
a
sea
burst
upon
it
the
*NL*
lighter
sprays
fell
upon
her
deck
and
wetted
us
like
rain
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
brightness
of
the
night
showed
us
these
perils
as
clearly
as
by
day
,
*NL*
which
was
,
perhaps
,
the
more
alarming
.
It
showed
me
,
too
,
the
face
of
*NL*
the
captain
as
he
stood
by
the
steersman
,
now
on
one
foot
,
now
on
the
*NL*
other
,
and
sometimes
blowing
in
his
hands
,
but
still
listening
and
*NL*
looking
and
as
steady
as
steel
.
Neither
he
nor
Mr.
Riach
had
shown
*NL*
well
in
the
fighting
;
but
I
saw
they
were
brave
in
their
own
trade
,
and
*NL*
admired
them
all
the
more
because
I
found
Alan
very
white
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ochone
,
David
,
''
says
he
,
``
this
is
no
the
kind
of
death
I
fancy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
Alan
!
''
I
cried
,
``
you
're
not
afraid
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
he
,
wetting
his
lips
,
``
but
you
'll
allow
,
yourself
,
it
's
a
*NL*
cold
ending
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
,
now
and
then
sheering
to
one
side
or
the
other
to
avoid
a
*NL*
reef
,
but
still
hugging
the
wind
and
the
land
,
we
had
got
round
Iona
and
*NL*
begun
to
come
alongside
Mull
.
The
tide
at
the
tail
of
the
land
ran
very
*NL*
strong
,
and
threw
the
brig
about
.
Two
hands
were
put
to
the
helm
,
and
*NL*
Hoseason
himself
would
sometimes
lend
a
help
;
and
it
was
strange
to
*NL*
see
three
strong
men
throw
their
weight
upon
the
tiller
,
and
it
-LRB-
like
a
*NL*
living
thing
-RRB-
struggle
against
and
drive
them
back
.
This
would
have
*NL*
been
the
greater
danger
had
not
the
sea
been
for
some
while
free
of
*NL*
obstacles
.
Mr.
Riach
,
besides
,
announced
from
the
top
that
he
saw
clear
*NL*
water
ahead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye
were
right
,
''
said
Hoseason
to
Alan
.
``
Ye
have
saved
the
brig
,
sir
.
*NL*
I
'll
mind
that
when
we
come
to
clear
accounts
.
''
And
I
believe
he
not
*NL*
only
meant
what
he
said
,
but
would
have
done
it
;
so
high
a
place
did
the
*NL*
Covenant
hold
in
his
affections
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
is
matter
only
for
conjecture
,
things
having
gone
otherwise
*NL*
than
he
forecast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Keep
her
away
a
point
,
''
sings
out
Mr.
Riach
.
``
Reef
to
windward
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
just
at
the
same
time
the
tide
caught
the
brig
,
and
threw
the
wind
*NL*
out
of
her
sails
.
She
came
round
into
the
wind
like
a
top
,
and
the
next
*NL*
moment
struck
the
reef
with
such
a
dunch
as
threw
us
all
flat
upon
the
*NL*
deck
,
and
came
near
to
shake
Mr.
Riach
from
his
place
upon
the
mast
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
on
my
feet
in
a
minute
.
The
reef
on
which
we
had
struck
was
close
*NL*
in
under
the
southwest
end
of
Mull
,
off
a
little
isle
they
call
Earraid
,
*NL*
which
lay
low
and
black
upon
the
larboard
.
Sometimes
the
swell
broke
*NL*
clean
over
us
;
sometimes
it
only
ground
the
poor
brig
upon
the
reef
,
so
*NL*
that
we
could
hear
her
beat
herself
to
pieces
;
and
what
with
the
great
*NL*
noise
of
the
sails
,
and
the
singing
of
the
wind
,
and
the
flying
of
the
*NL*
spray
in
the
moonlight
,
and
the
sense
of
danger
,
I
think
my
head
must
*NL*
have
been
partly
turned
,
for
I
could
scarcely
understand
the
things
I
*NL*
saw
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
I
observed
Mr.
Riach
and
the
seamen
busy
round
the
skiff
,
and
,
*NL*
still
in
the
same
blank
,
ran
over
to
assist
them
;
and
as
soon
as
I
set
*NL*
my
hand
to
work
,
my
mind
came
clear
again
.
It
was
no
very
easy
task
,
for
*NL*
the
skiff
lay
amidships
and
was
full
of
hamper
,
and
the
breaking
of
the
*NL*
heavier
seas
continually
forced
us
to
give
over
and
hold
on
;
but
we
all
*NL*
wrought
like
horses
while
we
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
such
of
the
wounded
as
could
move
came
clambering
out
of
the
*NL*
fore-scuttle
and
began
to
help
;
while
the
rest
that
lay
helpless
in
*NL*
their
bunks
harrowed
me
with
screaming
and
begging
to
be
saved
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
took
no
part
.
It
seemed
he
was
struck
stupid
.
He
stood
*NL*
holding
by
the
shrouds
,
talking
to
himself
and
groaning
out
aloud
*NL*
whenever
the
ship
hammered
on
the
rock
.
His
brig
was
like
wife
and
*NL*
child
to
him
;
he
had
looked
on
,
day
by
day
,
at
the
mishandling
of
poor
*NL*
Ransome
;
but
when
it
came
to
the
brig
,
he
seemed
to
suffer
along
with
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
time
of
our
working
at
the
boat
,
I
remember
only
one
other
*NL*
thing
:
that
I
asked
Alan
,
looking
across
at
the
shore
,
what
country
it
*NL*
was
;
and
he
answered
,
it
was
the
worst
possible
for
him
,
for
it
was
a
*NL*
land
of
the
Campbells
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
one
of
the
wounded
men
told
off
to
keep
a
watch
upon
the
seas
and
*NL*
cry
us
warning
.
Well
,
we
had
the
boat
about
ready
to
be
launched
,
when
*NL*
this
man
sang
out
pretty
shrill
:
``
For
God
's
sake
,
hold
on
!
''
We
knew
*NL*
by
his
tone
that
it
was
something
more
than
ordinary
;
and
sure
enough
,
*NL*
there
followed
a
sea
so
huge
that
it
lifted
the
brig
right
up
and
canted
*NL*
her
over
on
her
beam
.
Whether
the
cry
came
too
late
,
or
my
hold
was
too
*NL*
weak
,
I
know
not
;
but
at
the
sudden
tilting
of
the
ship
I
was
cast
clean
*NL*
over
the
bulwarks
into
the
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
down
,
and
drank
my
fill
,
and
then
came
up
,
and
got
a
blink
of
the
*NL*
moon
,
and
then
down
again
.
They
say
a
man
sinks
a
third
time
for
good
.
I
*NL*
can
not
be
made
like
other
folk
,
then
;
for
I
would
not
like
to
write
how
*NL*
often
I
went
down
,
or
how
often
I
came
up
again
.
All
the
while
,
I
was
*NL*
being
hurled
along
,
and
beaten
upon
and
choked
,
and
then
swallowed
*NL*
whole
;
and
the
thing
was
so
distracting
to
my
wits
,
that
I
was
neither
*NL*
sorry
nor
afraid
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
,
I
found
I
was
holding
to
a
spar
,
which
helped
me
somewhat
.
*NL*
And
then
all
of
a
sudden
I
was
in
quiet
water
,
and
began
to
come
to
*NL*
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
spare
yard
I
had
got
hold
of
,
and
I
was
amazed
to
see
how
far
*NL*
I
had
travelled
from
the
brig.
I
hailed
her
,
indeed
;
but
it
was
plain
*NL*
she
was
already
out
of
cry
.
She
was
still
holding
together
;
but
whether
*NL*
or
not
they
had
yet
launched
the
boat
,
I
was
too
far
off
and
too
low
*NL*
down
to
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
I
was
hailing
the
brig
,
I
spied
a
tract
of
water
lying
between
*NL*
us
where
no
great
waves
came
,
but
which
yet
boiled
white
all
over
and
*NL*
bristled
in
the
moon
with
rings
and
bubbles
.
Sometimes
the
whole
tract
*NL*
swung
to
one
side
,
like
the
tail
of
a
live
serpent
;
sometimes
,
for
a
*NL*
glimpse
,
it
would
all
disappear
and
then
boil
up
again
.
What
it
was
I
*NL*
had
no
guess
,
which
for
the
time
increased
my
fear
of
it
;
but
I
now
know
*NL*
it
must
have
been
the
roost
or
tide
race
,
which
had
carried
me
away
so
*NL*
fast
and
tumbled
me
about
so
cruelly
,
and
at
last
,
as
if
tired
of
that
*NL*
play
,
had
flung
out
me
and
the
spare
yard
upon
its
landward
margin
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
now
lay
quite
becalmed
,
and
began
to
feel
that
a
man
can
die
of
cold
*NL*
as
well
as
of
drowning
.
The
shores
of
Earraid
were
close
in
;
I
could
see
*NL*
in
the
moonlight
the
dots
of
heather
and
the
sparkling
of
the
mica
in
*NL*
the
rocks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
thought
I
to
myself
,
``
if
I
can
not
get
as
far
as
that
,
it
's
*NL*
strange
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
no
skill
of
swimming
,
Essen
Water
being
small
in
our
*NL*
neighbourhood
;
but
when
I
laid
hold
upon
the
yard
with
both
arms
,
and
*NL*
kicked
out
with
both
feet
,
I
soon
begun
to
find
that
I
was
moving
.
Hard
*NL*
work
it
was
,
and
mortally
slow
;
but
in
about
an
hour
of
kicking
*NL*
and
splashing
,
I
had
got
well
in
between
the
points
of
a
sandy
bay
*NL*
surrounded
by
low
hills
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sea
was
here
quite
quiet
;
there
was
no
sound
of
any
surf
;
the
moon
*NL*
shone
clear
;
and
I
thought
in
my
heart
I
had
never
seen
a
place
so
*NL*
desert
and
desolate
.
But
it
was
dry
land
;
and
when
at
last
it
grew
so
*NL*
shallow
that
I
could
leave
the
yard
and
wade
ashore
upon
my
feet
,
I
*NL*
can
not
tell
if
I
was
more
tired
or
more
grateful
.
Both
,
at
least
,
I
was
:
*NL*
tired
as
I
never
was
before
that
night
;
and
grateful
to
God
as
I
trust
I
*NL*
have
been
often
,
though
never
with
more
cause
.

CHAPTER
XIV
*NL*
*NL*
THE
ISLET
*NL*
*NL*
With
my
stepping
ashore
I
began
the
most
unhappy
part
of
my
adventures
.
*NL*
It
was
half-past
twelve
in
the
morning
,
and
though
the
wind
was
broken
*NL*
by
the
land
,
it
was
a
cold
night
.
I
dared
not
sit
down
-LRB-
for
I
thought
*NL*
I
should
have
frozen
-RRB-
,
but
took
off
my
shoes
and
walked
to
and
fro
upon
*NL*
the
sand
,
bare-foot
,
and
beating
my
breast
with
infinite
weariness
.
*NL*
There
was
no
sound
of
man
or
cattle
;
not
a
cock
crew
,
though
it
was
*NL*
about
the
hour
of
their
first
waking
;
only
the
surf
broke
outside
in
the
*NL*
distance
,
which
put
me
in
mind
of
my
perils
and
those
of
my
friend
.
*NL*
To
walk
by
the
sea
at
that
hour
of
the
morning
,
and
in
a
place
so
*NL*
desert-like
and
lonesome
,
struck
me
with
a
kind
of
fear
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
the
day
began
to
break
I
put
on
my
shoes
and
climbed
a
*NL*
hill
--
the
ruggedest
scramble
I
ever
undertook
--
falling
,
the
whole
way
,
*NL*
between
big
blocks
of
granite
,
or
leaping
from
one
to
another
.
When
I
*NL*
got
to
the
top
the
dawn
was
come
.
There
was
no
sign
of
the
brig
,
which
*NL*
must
have
lifted
from
the
reef
and
sunk
.
The
boat
,
too
,
was
nowhere
to
*NL*
be
seen
.
There
was
never
a
sail
upon
the
ocean
;
and
in
what
I
could
see
*NL*
of
the
land
was
neither
house
nor
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
afraid
to
think
what
had
befallen
my
shipmates
,
and
afraid
to
look
*NL*
longer
at
so
empty
a
scene
.
What
with
my
wet
clothes
and
weariness
,
and
*NL*
my
belly
that
now
began
to
ache
with
hunger
,
I
had
enough
to
trouble
*NL*
me
without
that
.
So
I
set
off
eastward
along
the
south
coast
,
hoping
to
*NL*
find
a
house
where
I
might
warm
myself
,
and
perhaps
get
news
of
those
I
*NL*
had
lost
.
And
at
the
worst
,
I
considered
the
sun
would
soon
rise
and
dry
*NL*
my
clothes
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
little
,
my
way
was
stopped
by
a
creek
or
inlet
of
the
sea
,
which
*NL*
seemed
to
run
pretty
deep
into
the
land
;
and
as
I
had
no
means
to
get
*NL*
across
,
I
must
needs
change
my
direction
to
go
about
the
end
of
it
.
It
*NL*
was
still
the
roughest
kind
of
walking
;
indeed
the
whole
,
not
only
of
*NL*
Earraid
,
but
of
the
neighbouring
part
of
Mull
-LRB-
which
they
call
the
Ross
-RRB-
*NL*
is
nothing
but
a
jumble
of
granite
rocks
with
heather
in
among
.
At
first
*NL*
the
creek
kept
narrowing
as
I
had
looked
to
see
;
but
presently
to
my
*NL*
surprise
it
began
to
widen
out
again
.
At
this
I
scratched
my
head
,
*NL*
but
had
still
no
notion
of
the
truth
:
until
at
last
I
came
to
a
rising
*NL*
ground
,
and
it
burst
upon
me
all
in
a
moment
that
I
was
cast
upon
a
*NL*
little
barren
isle
,
and
cut
off
on
every
side
by
the
salt
seas
.
*NL*
*NL*
Instead
of
the
sun
rising
to
dry
me
,
it
came
on
to
rain
,
with
a
thick
*NL*
mist
;
so
that
my
case
was
lamentable
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
stood
in
the
rain
,
and
shivered
,
and
wondered
what
to
do
,
till
it
*NL*
occurred
to
me
that
perhaps
the
creek
was
fordable
.
Back
I
went
to
the
*NL*
narrowest
point
and
waded
in
.
But
not
three
yards
from
shore
,
I
plumped
*NL*
in
head
over
ears
;
and
if
ever
I
was
heard
of
more
,
it
was
rather
by
*NL*
God
's
grace
than
my
own
prudence
.
I
was
no
wetter
-LRB-
for
that
could
hardly
*NL*
be
-RRB-
,
but
I
was
all
the
colder
for
this
mishap
;
and
having
lost
another
*NL*
hope
was
the
more
unhappy
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
,
all
at
once
,
the
yard
came
in
my
head
.
What
had
carried
me
*NL*
through
the
roost
would
surely
serve
me
to
cross
this
little
quiet
creek
*NL*
in
safety
.
With
that
I
set
off
,
undaunted
,
across
the
top
of
the
isle
,
*NL*
to
fetch
and
carry
it
back
.
It
was
a
weary
tramp
in
all
ways
,
and
if
*NL*
hope
had
not
buoyed
me
up
,
I
must
have
cast
myself
down
and
given
up
.
*NL*
Whether
with
the
sea
salt
,
or
because
I
was
growing
fevered
,
I
was
*NL*
distressed
with
thirst
,
and
had
to
stop
,
as
I
went
,
and
drink
the
peaty
*NL*
water
out
of
the
hags
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
came
to
the
bay
at
last
,
more
dead
than
alive
;
and
at
the
first
*NL*
glance
,
I
thought
the
yard
was
something
farther
out
than
when
I
left
*NL*
it
.
In
I
went
,
for
the
third
time
,
into
the
sea
.
The
sand
was
smooth
*NL*
and
firm
,
and
shelved
gradually
down
,
so
that
I
could
wade
out
till
the
*NL*
water
was
almost
to
my
neck
and
the
little
waves
splashed
into
my
face
.
*NL*
But
at
that
depth
my
feet
began
to
leave
me
,
and
I
durst
venture
in
no
*NL*
farther
.
As
for
the
yard
,
I
saw
it
bobbing
very
quietly
some
twenty
feet
*NL*
beyond
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
borne
up
well
until
this
last
disappointment
;
but
at
that
I
came
*NL*
ashore
,
and
flung
myself
down
upon
the
sands
and
wept
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
time
I
spent
upon
the
island
is
still
so
horrible
a
thought
to
me
,
*NL*
that
I
must
pass
it
lightly
over
.
In
all
the
books
I
have
read
of
people
*NL*
cast
away
,
they
had
either
their
pockets
full
of
tools
,
or
a
chest
of
*NL*
things
would
be
thrown
upon
the
beach
along
with
them
,
as
if
on
purpose
.
*NL*
My
case
was
very
different
.
I
had
nothing
in
my
pockets
but
money
and
*NL*
Alan
's
silver
button
;
and
being
inland
bred
,
I
was
as
much
short
of
*NL*
knowledge
as
of
means
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
knew
indeed
that
shell-fish
were
counted
good
to
eat
;
and
among
the
*NL*
rocks
of
the
isle
I
found
a
great
plenty
of
limpets
,
which
at
first
I
*NL*
could
scarcely
strike
from
their
places
,
not
knowing
quickness
to
be
*NL*
needful
.
There
were
,
besides
,
some
of
the
little
shells
that
we
call
*NL*
buckies
;
I
think
periwinkle
is
the
English
name
.
Of
these
two
I
made
my
*NL*
whole
diet
,
devouring
them
cold
and
raw
as
I
found
them
;
and
so
hungry
*NL*
was
I
,
that
at
first
they
seemed
to
me
delicious
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
they
were
out
of
season
,
or
perhaps
there
was
something
wrong
*NL*
in
the
sea
about
my
island
.
But
at
least
I
had
no
sooner
eaten
my
first
*NL*
meal
than
I
was
seized
with
giddiness
and
retching
,
and
lay
for
a
long
*NL*
time
no
better
than
dead
.
A
second
trial
of
the
same
food
-LRB-
indeed
I
had
*NL*
no
other
-RRB-
did
better
with
me
,
and
revived
my
strength
.
But
as
long
as
*NL*
I
was
on
the
island
,
I
never
knew
what
to
expect
when
I
had
eaten
;
*NL*
sometimes
all
was
well
,
and
sometimes
I
was
thrown
into
a
miserable
*NL*
sickness
;
nor
could
I
ever
distinguish
what
particular
fish
it
was
that
*NL*
hurt
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
day
it
streamed
rain
;
the
island
ran
like
a
sop
,
there
was
no
dry
*NL*
spot
to
be
found
;
and
when
I
lay
down
that
night
,
between
two
boulders
*NL*
that
made
a
kind
of
roof
,
my
feet
were
in
a
bog
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
second
day
I
crossed
the
island
to
all
sides
.
There
was
no
one
part
*NL*
of
it
better
than
another
;
it
was
all
desolate
and
rocky
;
nothing
living
*NL*
on
it
but
game
birds
which
I
lacked
the
means
to
kill
,
and
the
gulls
*NL*
which
haunted
the
outlying
rocks
in
a
prodigious
number
.
But
the
creek
,
*NL*
or
strait
,
that
cut
off
the
isle
from
the
main-land
of
the
Ross
,
opened
*NL*
out
on
the
north
into
a
bay
,
and
the
bay
again
opened
into
the
Sound
of
*NL*
Iona
;
and
it
was
the
neighbourhood
of
this
place
that
I
chose
to
be
my
*NL*
home
;
though
if
I
had
thought
upon
the
very
name
of
home
in
such
a
spot
,
*NL*
I
must
have
burst
out
weeping
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
good
reasons
for
my
choice
.
There
was
in
this
part
of
the
isle
a
*NL*
little
hut
of
a
house
like
a
pig
's
hut
,
where
fishers
used
to
sleep
when
*NL*
they
came
there
upon
their
business
;
but
the
turf
roof
of
it
had
fallen
*NL*
entirely
in
;
so
that
the
hut
was
of
no
use
to
me
,
and
gave
me
less
*NL*
shelter
than
my
rocks
.
What
was
more
important
,
the
shell-fish
on
which
*NL*
I
lived
grew
there
in
great
plenty
;
when
the
tide
was
out
I
could
gather
*NL*
a
peck
at
a
time
:
and
this
was
doubtless
a
convenience
.
But
the
other
*NL*
reason
went
deeper
.
I
had
become
in
no
way
used
to
the
horrid
solitude
*NL*
of
the
isle
,
but
still
looked
round
me
on
all
sides
-LRB-
like
a
man
that
*NL*
was
hunted
-RRB-
,
between
fear
and
hope
that
I
might
see
some
human
creature
*NL*
coming
.
Now
,
from
a
little
up
the
hillside
over
the
bay
,
I
could
catch
a
*NL*
sight
of
the
great
,
ancient
church
and
the
roofs
of
the
people
's
houses
*NL*
in
Iona
.
And
on
the
other
hand
,
over
the
low
country
of
the
Ross
,
I
saw
*NL*
smoke
go
up
,
morning
and
evening
,
as
if
from
a
homestead
in
a
hollow
of
*NL*
the
land
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
used
to
watch
this
smoke
,
when
I
was
wet
and
cold
,
and
had
my
head
*NL*
half
turned
with
loneliness
;
and
think
of
the
fireside
and
the
*NL*
company
,
till
my
heart
burned
.
It
was
the
same
with
the
roofs
of
Iona
.
*NL*
Altogether
,
this
sight
I
had
of
men
's
homes
and
comfortable
lives
,
*NL*
although
it
put
a
point
on
my
own
sufferings
,
yet
it
kept
hope
alive
,
*NL*
and
helped
me
to
eat
my
raw
shell-fish
-LRB-
which
had
soon
grown
to
be
a
*NL*
disgust
-RRB-
,
and
saved
me
from
the
sense
of
horror
I
had
whenever
I
was
*NL*
quite
alone
with
dead
rocks
,
and
fowls
,
and
the
rain
,
and
the
cold
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
say
it
kept
hope
alive
;
and
indeed
it
seemed
impossible
that
I
should
*NL*
be
left
to
die
on
the
shores
of
my
own
country
,
and
within
view
of
a
*NL*
church-tower
and
the
smoke
of
men
's
houses
.
But
the
second
day
passed
;
*NL*
and
though
as
long
as
the
light
lasted
I
kept
a
bright
look-out
for
*NL*
boats
on
the
Sound
or
men
passing
on
the
Ross
,
no
help
came
near
me
.
It
*NL*
still
rained
,
and
I
turned
in
to
sleep
,
as
wet
as
ever
,
and
with
a
cruel
*NL*
sore
throat
,
but
a
little
comforted
,
perhaps
,
by
having
said
good-night
*NL*
to
my
next
neighbours
,
the
people
of
Iona
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
the
Second
declared
a
man
could
stay
outdoors
more
days
in
the
*NL*
year
in
the
climate
of
England
than
in
any
other
.
This
was
very
like
a
*NL*
king
,
with
a
palace
at
his
back
and
changes
of
dry
clothes
.
But
he
must
*NL*
have
had
better
luck
on
his
flight
from
Worcester
than
I
had
on
that
*NL*
miserable
isle
.
It
was
the
height
of
the
summer
;
yet
it
rained
for
more
*NL*
than
twenty-four
hours
,
and
did
not
clear
until
the
afternoon
of
the
*NL*
third
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
day
of
incidents
.
In
the
morning
I
saw
a
red
deer
,
a
buck
*NL*
with
a
fine
spread
of
antlers
,
standing
in
the
rain
on
the
top
of
the
*NL*
island
;
but
he
had
scarce
seen
me
rise
from
under
my
rock
,
before
*NL*
he
trotted
off
upon
the
other
side
.
I
supposed
he
must
have
swum
the
*NL*
strait
;
though
what
should
bring
any
creature
to
Earraid
,
was
more
than
*NL*
I
could
fancy
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
little
after
,
as
I
was
jumping
about
after
my
limpets
,
I
was
startled
*NL*
by
a
guinea-piece
,
which
fell
upon
a
rock
in
front
of
me
and
glanced
off
*NL*
into
the
sea
.
When
the
sailors
gave
me
my
money
again
,
they
kept
back
*NL*
not
only
about
a
third
of
the
whole
sum
,
but
my
father
's
leather
purse
;
*NL*
so
that
from
that
day
out
,
I
carried
my
gold
loose
in
a
pocket
with
a
*NL*
button
.
I
now
saw
there
must
be
a
hole
,
and
clapped
my
hand
to
the
place
*NL*
in
a
great
hurry
.
But
this
was
to
lock
the
stable
door
after
the
steed
*NL*
was
stolen
.
I
had
left
the
shore
at
Queensferry
with
near
on
fifty
*NL*
pounds
;
now
I
found
no
more
than
two
guinea-pieces
and
a
silver
*NL*
shilling
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
true
I
picked
up
a
third
guinea
a
little
after
,
where
it
lay
*NL*
shining
on
a
piece
of
turf
.
That
made
a
fortune
of
three
pounds
and
four
*NL*
shillings
,
English
money
,
for
a
lad
,
the
rightful
heir
of
an
estate
,
and
*NL*
now
starving
on
an
isle
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
wild
Highlands
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
state
of
my
affairs
dashed
me
still
further
;
and
,
indeed
my
plight
*NL*
on
that
third
morning
was
truly
pitiful
.
My
clothes
were
beginning
to
*NL*
rot
;
my
stockings
in
particular
were
quite
worn
through
,
so
that
my
*NL*
shanks
went
naked
;
my
hands
had
grown
quite
soft
with
the
continual
*NL*
soaking
;
my
throat
was
very
sore
,
my
strength
had
much
abated
,
and
my
*NL*
heart
so
turned
against
the
horrid
stuff
I
was
condemned
to
eat
,
that
*NL*
the
very
sight
of
it
came
near
to
sicken
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
the
worst
was
not
yet
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
a
pretty
high
rock
on
the
northwest
of
Earraid
,
which
-LRB-
because
*NL*
it
had
a
flat
top
and
overlooked
the
Sound
-RRB-
I
was
much
in
the
habit
of
*NL*
frequenting
;
not
that
ever
I
stayed
in
one
place
,
save
when
asleep
,
my
*NL*
misery
giving
me
no
rest
.
Indeed
,
I
wore
myself
down
with
continual
and
*NL*
aimless
goings
and
comings
in
the
rain
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
,
however
,
as
the
sun
came
out
,
I
lay
down
on
the
top
of
that
*NL*
rock
to
dry
myself
.
The
comfort
of
the
sunshine
is
a
thing
I
can
not
*NL*
tell
.
It
set
me
thinking
hopefully
of
my
deliverance
,
of
which
I
had
*NL*
begun
to
despair
;
and
I
scanned
the
sea
and
the
Ross
with
a
fresh
*NL*
interest
.
On
the
south
of
my
rock
,
a
part
of
the
island
jutted
out
and
*NL*
hid
the
open
ocean
,
so
that
a
boat
could
thus
come
quite
near
me
upon
*NL*
that
side
,
and
I
be
none
the
wiser
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
a
coble
with
a
brown
sail
and
a
pair
of
fishers
*NL*
aboard
of
it
,
came
flying
round
that
corner
of
the
isle
,
bound
for
Iona
.
*NL*
I
shouted
out
,
and
then
fell
on
my
knees
on
the
rock
and
reached
up
my
*NL*
hands
and
prayed
to
them
.
They
were
near
enough
to
hear
--
I
could
even
*NL*
see
the
colour
of
their
hair
;
and
there
was
no
doubt
but
they
observed
*NL*
me
,
for
they
cried
out
in
the
Gaelic
tongue
,
and
laughed
.
But
the
boat
*NL*
never
turned
aside
,
and
flew
on
,
right
before
my
eyes
,
for
Iona
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
believe
such
wickedness
,
and
ran
along
the
shore
from
rock
*NL*
to
rock
,
crying
on
them
piteously
even
after
they
were
out
of
reach
*NL*
of
my
voice
,
I
still
cried
and
waved
to
them
;
and
when
they
were
quite
*NL*
gone
,
I
thought
my
heart
would
have
burst
.
All
the
time
of
my
troubles
*NL*
I
wept
only
twice
.
Once
,
when
I
could
not
reach
the
yard
,
and
now
,
the
*NL*
second
time
,
when
these
fishers
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
my
cries
.
But
this
*NL*
time
I
wept
and
roared
like
a
wicked
child
,
tearing
up
the
turf
with
*NL*
my
nails
,
and
grinding
my
face
in
the
earth
.
If
a
wish
would
kill
men
,
*NL*
those
two
fishers
would
never
have
seen
morning
,
and
I
should
likely
*NL*
have
died
upon
my
island
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
was
a
little
over
my
anger
,
I
must
eat
again
,
but
with
such
*NL*
loathing
of
the
mess
as
I
could
now
scarce
control
.
Sure
enough
,
I
*NL*
should
have
done
as
well
to
fast
,
for
my
fishes
poisoned
me
again
.
I
had
*NL*
all
my
first
pains
;
my
throat
was
so
sore
I
could
scarce
swallow
;
I
had
*NL*
a
fit
of
strong
shuddering
,
which
clucked
my
teeth
together
;
and
there
*NL*
came
on
me
that
dreadful
sense
of
illness
,
which
we
have
no
name
for
*NL*
either
in
Scotch
or
English
.
I
thought
I
should
have
died
,
and
made
my
*NL*
peace
with
God
,
forgiving
all
men
,
even
my
uncle
and
the
fishers
;
and
as
*NL*
soon
as
I
had
thus
made
up
my
mind
to
the
worst
,
clearness
came
upon
me
;
*NL*
I
observed
the
night
was
falling
dry
;
my
clothes
were
dried
a
good
deal
;
*NL*
truly
,
I
was
in
a
better
case
than
ever
before
,
since
I
had
landed
on
*NL*
the
isle
;
and
so
I
got
to
sleep
at
last
,
with
a
thought
of
gratitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
-LRB-
which
was
the
fourth
of
this
horrible
life
of
mine
-RRB-
I
*NL*
found
my
bodily
strength
run
very
low
.
But
the
sun
shone
,
the
air
was
*NL*
sweet
,
and
what
I
managed
to
eat
of
the
shell-fish
agreed
well
with
me
*NL*
and
revived
my
courage
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
scarce
back
on
my
rock
-LRB-
where
I
went
always
the
first
thing
after
*NL*
I
had
eaten
-RRB-
before
I
observed
a
boat
coming
down
the
Sound
,
and
with
*NL*
her
head
,
as
I
thought
,
in
my
direction
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
began
at
once
to
hope
and
fear
exceedingly
;
for
I
thought
these
men
*NL*
might
have
thought
better
of
their
cruelty
and
be
coming
back
to
my
*NL*
assistance
.
But
another
disappointment
,
such
as
yesterday
's
,
was
more
*NL*
than
I
could
bear
.
I
turned
my
back
,
accordingly
,
upon
the
sea
,
and
*NL*
did
not
look
again
till
I
had
counted
many
hundreds
.
The
boat
was
still
*NL*
heading
for
the
island
.
The
next
time
I
counted
the
full
thousand
,
as
*NL*
slowly
as
I
could
,
my
heart
beating
so
as
to
hurt
me
.
And
then
it
was
*NL*
out
of
all
question
.
She
was
coming
straight
to
Earraid
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
no
longer
hold
myself
back
,
but
ran
to
the
seaside
and
out
,
*NL*
from
one
rock
to
another
,
as
far
as
I
could
go
.
It
is
a
marvel
I
was
not
*NL*
drowned
;
for
when
I
was
brought
to
a
stand
at
last
,
my
legs
shook
under
*NL*
me
,
and
my
mouth
was
so
dry
,
I
must
wet
it
with
the
sea-water
before
I
*NL*
was
able
to
shout
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
time
the
boat
was
coming
on
;
and
now
I
was
able
to
perceive
*NL*
it
was
the
same
boat
and
the
same
two
men
as
yesterday
.
This
I
knew
by
*NL*
their
hair
,
which
the
one
had
of
a
bright
yellow
and
the
other
black
.
*NL*
But
now
there
was
a
third
man
along
with
them
,
who
looked
to
be
of
a
*NL*
better
class
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
they
were
come
within
easy
speech
,
they
let
down
their
sail
*NL*
and
lay
quiet
.
In
spite
of
my
supplications
,
they
drew
no
nearer
in
,
and
*NL*
what
frightened
me
most
of
all
,
the
new
man
tee-hee
'd
with
laughter
as
*NL*
he
talked
and
looked
at
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
stood
up
in
the
boat
and
addressed
me
a
long
while
,
speaking
*NL*
fast
and
with
many
wavings
of
his
hand
.
I
told
him
I
had
no
Gaelic
;
and
*NL*
at
this
he
became
very
angry
,
and
I
began
to
suspect
he
thought
he
was
*NL*
talking
English
.
Listening
very
close
,
I
caught
the
word
``
whateffer
''
*NL*
several
times
;
but
all
the
rest
was
Gaelic
and
might
have
been
Greek
and
*NL*
Hebrew
for
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whatever
,
''
said
I
,
to
show
him
I
had
caught
a
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
--
yes
,
yes
,
''
says
he
,
and
then
he
looked
at
the
other
men
,
as
*NL*
much
as
to
say
,
``
I
told
you
I
spoke
English
,
''
and
began
again
as
hard
as
*NL*
ever
in
the
Gaelic
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
time
I
picked
out
another
word
,
``
tide
.
''
Then
I
had
a
flash
of
hope
.
*NL*
I
remembered
he
was
always
waving
his
hand
towards
the
mainland
of
the
*NL*
Ross
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
when
the
tide
is
out
--
?
''
I
cried
,
and
could
not
finish
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
said
he
.
``
Tide
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
I
turned
tail
upon
their
boat
-LRB-
where
my
adviser
had
once
more
*NL*
begun
to
tee-hee
with
laughter
-RRB-
,
leaped
back
the
way
I
had
come
,
from
*NL*
one
stone
to
another
,
and
set
off
running
across
the
isle
as
I
had
never
*NL*
run
before
.
In
about
half
an
hour
I
came
out
upon
the
shores
of
the
*NL*
creek
;
and
,
sure
enough
,
it
was
shrunk
into
a
little
trickle
of
water
,
*NL*
through
which
I
dashed
,
not
above
my
knees
,
and
landed
with
a
shout
on
*NL*
the
main
island
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
sea-bred
boy
would
not
have
stayed
a
day
on
Earraid
;
which
is
only
*NL*
what
they
call
a
tidal
islet
,
and
except
in
the
bottom
of
the
neaps
,
can
*NL*
be
entered
and
left
twice
in
every
twenty-four
hours
,
either
dry-shod
,
*NL*
or
at
the
most
by
wading
.
Even
I
,
who
had
the
tide
going
out
and
in
*NL*
before
me
in
the
bay
,
and
even
watched
for
the
ebbs
,
the
better
to
get
*NL*
my
shellfish
--
even
I
-LRB-
I
say
-RRB-
if
I
had
sat
down
to
think
,
instead
of
*NL*
raging
at
my
fate
,
must
have
soon
guessed
the
secret
,
and
got
free
.
It
*NL*
was
no
wonder
the
fishers
had
not
understood
me
.
The
wonder
was
rather
*NL*
that
they
had
ever
guessed
my
pitiful
illusion
,
and
taken
the
trouble
to
*NL*
come
back
.
I
had
starved
with
cold
and
hunger
on
that
island
for
close
*NL*
upon
one
hundred
hours
.
But
for
the
fishers
,
I
might
have
left
my
bones
*NL*
there
,
in
pure
folly
.
And
even
as
it
was
,
I
had
paid
for
it
pretty
dear
,
*NL*
not
only
in
past
sufferings
,
but
in
my
present
case
;
being
clothed
like
*NL*
a
beggar-man
,
scarce
able
to
walk
,
and
in
great
pain
of
my
sore
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
seen
wicked
men
and
fools
,
a
great
many
of
both
;
and
I
believe
*NL*
they
both
get
paid
in
the
end
;
but
the
fools
first
.

CHAPTER
XV
*NL*
*NL*
THE
LAD
WITH
THE
SILVER
BUTTON
:
THROUGH
THE
ISLE
OF
MULL
*NL*
*NL*
The
Ross
of
Mull
,
which
I
had
now
got
upon
,
was
rugged
and
trackless
,
*NL*
like
the
isle
I
had
just
left
;
being
all
bog
,
and
brier
,
and
big
stone
.
*NL*
There
may
be
roads
for
them
that
know
that
country
well
;
but
for
my
part
*NL*
I
had
no
better
guide
than
my
own
nose
,
and
no
other
landmark
than
Ben
*NL*
More
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
aimed
as
well
as
I
could
for
the
smoke
I
had
seen
so
often
from
the
*NL*
island
;
and
with
all
my
great
weariness
and
the
difficulty
of
the
way
*NL*
came
upon
the
house
in
the
bottom
of
a
little
hollow
about
five
or
*NL*
six
at
night
.
It
was
low
and
longish
,
roofed
with
turf
and
built
of
*NL*
unmortared
stones
;
and
on
a
mound
in
front
of
it
,
an
old
gentleman
sat
*NL*
smoking
his
pipe
in
the
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
what
little
English
he
had
,
he
gave
me
to
understand
that
my
*NL*
shipmates
had
got
safe
ashore
,
and
had
broken
bread
in
that
very
house
*NL*
on
the
day
after
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
there
one
,
''
I
asked
,
``
dressed
like
a
gentleman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
they
all
wore
rough
great-coats
;
but
to
be
sure
,
the
first
of
*NL*
them
,
the
one
that
came
alone
,
wore
breeches
and
stockings
,
while
the
*NL*
rest
had
sailors
'
trousers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
I
,
``
and
he
would
have
a
feathered
hat
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
told
me
,
no
,
that
he
was
bareheaded
like
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
I
thought
Alan
might
have
lost
his
hat
;
and
then
the
rain
came
*NL*
in
my
mind
,
and
I
judged
it
more
likely
he
had
it
out
of
harm
's
way
*NL*
under
his
great-coat
.
This
set
me
smiling
,
partly
because
my
friend
was
*NL*
safe
,
partly
to
think
of
his
vanity
in
dress
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
the
old
gentleman
clapped
his
hand
to
his
brow
,
and
cried
out
*NL*
that
I
must
be
the
lad
with
the
silver
button
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
yes
!
''
said
I
,
in
some
wonder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
''
said
the
old
gentleman
,
``
I
have
a
word
for
you
,
that
you
*NL*
are
to
follow
your
friend
to
his
country
,
by
Torosay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
then
asked
me
how
I
had
fared
,
and
I
told
him
my
tale
.
A
*NL*
south-country
man
would
certainly
have
laughed
;
but
this
old
gentleman
*NL*
-LRB-
I
call
him
so
because
of
his
manners
,
for
his
clothes
were
dropping
off
*NL*
his
back
-RRB-
heard
me
all
through
with
nothing
but
gravity
and
pity
.
When
I
*NL*
had
done
,
he
took
me
by
the
hand
,
led
me
into
his
hut
-LRB-
it
was
no
better
-RRB-
*NL*
and
presented
me
before
his
wife
,
as
if
she
had
been
the
Queen
and
I
a
*NL*
duke
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
good
woman
set
oat-bread
before
me
and
a
cold
grouse
,
patting
my
*NL*
shoulder
and
smiling
to
me
all
the
time
,
for
she
had
no
English
;
and
the
*NL*
old
gentleman
-LRB-
not
to
be
behind
-RRB-
brewed
me
a
strong
punch
out
of
their
*NL*
country
spirit
.
All
the
while
I
was
eating
,
and
after
that
when
I
was
*NL*
drinking
the
punch
,
I
could
scarce
come
to
believe
in
my
good
fortune
;
*NL*
and
the
house
,
though
it
was
thick
with
the
peat-smoke
and
as
full
of
*NL*
holes
as
a
colander
,
seemed
like
a
palace
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
punch
threw
me
in
a
strong
sweat
and
a
deep
slumber
;
the
good
people
*NL*
let
me
lie
;
and
it
was
near
noon
of
the
next
day
before
I
took
the
road
,
*NL*
my
throat
already
easier
and
my
spirits
quite
restored
by
good
fare
and
*NL*
good
news
.
The
old
gentleman
,
although
I
pressed
him
hard
,
would
take
no
*NL*
money
,
and
gave
me
an
old
bonnet
for
my
head
;
though
I
am
free
to
own
I
*NL*
was
no
sooner
out
of
view
of
the
house
than
I
very
jealously
washed
this
*NL*
gift
of
his
in
a
wayside
fountain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thought
I
to
myself
:
``
If
these
are
the
wild
Highlanders
,
I
could
wish
my
*NL*
own
folk
wilder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
not
only
started
late
,
but
I
must
have
wandered
nearly
half
the
time
.
*NL*
True
,
I
met
plenty
of
people
,
grubbing
in
little
miserable
fields
that
*NL*
would
not
keep
a
cat
,
or
herding
little
kine
about
the
bigness
of
asses
.
*NL*
The
Highland
dress
being
forbidden
by
law
since
the
rebellion
,
and
the
*NL*
people
condemned
to
the
Lowland
habit
,
which
they
much
disliked
,
it
was
*NL*
strange
to
see
the
variety
of
their
array
.
Some
went
bare
,
only
for
a
*NL*
hanging
cloak
or
great-coat
,
and
carried
their
trousers
on
their
backs
*NL*
like
a
useless
burthen
:
some
had
made
an
imitation
of
the
tartan
with
*NL*
little
parti-coloured
stripes
patched
together
like
an
old
wife
's
quilt
;
*NL*
others
,
again
,
still
wore
the
Highland
philabeg
,
but
by
putting
a
few
*NL*
stitches
between
the
legs
transformed
it
into
a
pair
of
trousers
like
*NL*
a
Dutchman
's
.
All
those
makeshifts
were
condemned
and
punished
,
for
the
*NL*
law
was
harshly
applied
,
in
hopes
to
break
up
the
clan
spirit
;
but
in
*NL*
that
out-of-the-way
,
sea-bound
isle
,
there
were
few
to
make
remarks
and
*NL*
fewer
to
tell
tales
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
seemed
in
great
poverty
;
which
was
no
doubt
natural
,
now
that
*NL*
rapine
was
put
down
,
and
the
chiefs
kept
no
longer
an
open
house
;
*NL*
and
the
roads
-LRB-
even
such
a
wandering
,
country
by-track
as
the
one
*NL*
I
followed
-RRB-
were
infested
with
beggars
.
And
here
again
I
marked
*NL*
a
difference
from
my
own
part
of
the
country
.
For
our
Lowland
*NL*
beggars
--
even
the
gownsmen
themselves
,
who
beg
by
patent
--
had
a
louting
,
*NL*
flattering
way
with
them
,
and
if
you
gave
them
a
plaek
and
asked
change
,
*NL*
would
very
civilly
return
you
a
boddle
.
But
these
Highland
beggars
stood
*NL*
on
their
dignity
,
asked
alms
only
to
buy
snuff
-LRB-
by
their
account
-RRB-
and
*NL*
would
give
no
change
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
be
sure
,
this
was
no
concern
of
mine
,
except
in
so
far
as
it
*NL*
entertained
me
by
the
way
.
What
was
much
more
to
the
purpose
,
few
had
*NL*
any
English
,
and
these
few
-LRB-
unless
they
were
of
the
brotherhood
of
*NL*
beggars
-RRB-
not
very
anxious
to
place
it
at
my
service
.
I
knew
Torosay
*NL*
to
be
my
destination
,
and
repeated
the
name
to
them
and
pointed
;
but
*NL*
instead
of
simply
pointing
in
reply
,
they
would
give
me
a
screed
of
the
*NL*
Gaelic
that
set
me
foolish
;
so
it
was
small
wonder
if
I
went
out
of
my
*NL*
road
as
often
as
I
stayed
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
about
eight
at
night
,
and
already
very
weary
,
I
came
to
a
lone
*NL*
house
,
where
I
asked
admittance
,
and
was
refused
,
until
I
bethought
*NL*
me
of
the
power
of
money
in
so
poor
a
country
,
and
held
up
one
of
my
*NL*
guineas
in
my
finger
and
thumb
.
Thereupon
,
the
man
of
the
house
,
who
had
*NL*
hitherto
pretended
to
have
no
English
,
and
driven
me
from
his
door
by
*NL*
signals
,
suddenly
began
to
speak
as
clearly
as
was
needful
,
and
agreed
*NL*
for
five
shillings
to
give
me
a
night
's
lodging
and
guide
me
the
next
*NL*
day
to
Torosay
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
slept
uneasily
that
night
,
fearing
I
should
be
robbed
;
but
I
might
*NL*
have
spared
myself
the
pain
;
for
my
host
was
no
robber
,
only
miserably
*NL*
poor
and
a
great
cheat
.
He
was
not
alone
in
his
poverty
;
for
the
next
*NL*
morning
,
we
must
go
five
miles
about
to
the
house
of
what
he
called
a
*NL*
rich
man
to
have
one
of
my
guineas
changed
.
This
was
perhaps
a
rich
man
*NL*
for
Mull
;
he
would
have
scarce
been
thought
so
in
the
south
;
for
it
*NL*
took
all
he
had
--
the
whole
house
was
turned
upside
down
,
and
a
neighbour
*NL*
brought
under
contribution
,
before
he
could
scrape
together
twenty
*NL*
shillings
in
silver
.
The
odd
shilling
he
kept
for
himself
,
protesting
he
*NL*
could
ill
afford
to
have
so
great
a
sum
of
money
lying
``
locked
up
.
''
For
*NL*
all
that
he
was
very
courteous
and
well
spoken
,
made
us
both
sit
down
*NL*
with
his
family
to
dinner
,
and
brewed
punch
in
a
fine
china
bowl
,
over
*NL*
which
my
rascal
guide
grew
so
merry
that
he
refused
to
start
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
for
getting
angry
,
and
appealed
to
the
rich
man
-LRB-
Hector
Maclean
*NL*
was
his
name
-RRB-
,
who
had
been
a
witness
to
our
bargain
and
to
my
payment
*NL*
of
the
five
shillings
.
But
Maclean
had
taken
his
share
of
the
punch
,
*NL*
and
vowed
that
no
gentleman
should
leave
his
table
after
the
bowl
was
*NL*
brewed
;
so
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
sit
and
hear
Jacobite
toasts
*NL*
and
Gaelic
songs
,
till
all
were
tipsy
and
staggered
off
to
the
bed
or
*NL*
the
barn
for
their
night
's
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
-LRB-
the
fourth
of
my
travels
-RRB-
we
were
up
before
five
upon
the
*NL*
clock
;
but
my
rascal
guide
got
to
the
bottle
at
once
,
and
it
was
three
*NL*
hours
before
I
had
him
clear
of
the
house
,
and
then
-LRB-
as
you
shall
hear
-RRB-
*NL*
only
for
a
worse
disappointment
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
long
as
we
went
down
a
heathery
valley
that
lay
before
Mr.
Maclean
's
*NL*
house
,
all
went
well
;
only
my
guide
looked
constantly
over
his
shoulder
,
*NL*
and
when
I
asked
him
the
cause
,
only
grinned
at
me
.
No
sooner
,
however
,
*NL*
had
we
crossed
the
back
of
a
hill
,
and
got
out
of
sight
of
the
house
*NL*
windows
,
than
he
told
me
Torosay
lay
right
in
front
,
and
that
a
hill-top
*NL*
-LRB-
which
he
pointed
out
-RRB-
was
my
best
landmark
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
care
very
little
for
that
,
''
said
I
,
``
since
you
are
going
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
impudent
cheat
answered
me
in
the
Gaelic
that
he
had
no
English
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
fine
fellow
,
''
I
said
,
``
I
know
very
well
your
English
comes
and
goes
.
*NL*
Tell
me
what
will
bring
it
back
?
Is
it
more
money
you
wish
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Five
shillings
mair
,
''
said
he
,
``
and
hersel
'
will
bring
ye
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
reflected
awhile
and
then
offered
him
two
,
which
he
accepted
greedily
,
*NL*
and
insisted
on
having
in
his
hands
at
once
``
for
luck
,
''
as
he
said
,
but
*NL*
I
think
it
was
rather
for
my
misfortune
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
shillings
carried
him
not
quite
as
many
miles
;
at
the
end
of
*NL*
which
distance
,
he
sat
down
upon
the
wayside
and
took
off
his
brogues
*NL*
from
his
feet
,
like
a
man
about
to
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
now
red-hot
.
``
Ha
!
''
said
I
,
``
have
you
no
more
English
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
impudently
,
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
I
boiled
over
,
and
lifted
my
hand
to
strike
him
;
and
he
,
drawing
*NL*
a
knife
from
his
rags
,
squatted
back
and
grinned
at
me
like
a
wildcat
.
*NL*
At
that
,
forgetting
everything
but
my
anger
,
I
ran
in
upon
him
,
put
*NL*
aside
his
knife
with
my
left
,
and
struck
him
in
the
mouth
with
the
*NL*
right
.
I
was
a
strong
lad
and
very
angry
,
and
he
but
a
little
man
;
and
*NL*
he
went
down
before
me
heavily
.
By
good
luck
,
his
knife
flew
out
of
his
*NL*
hand
as
he
fell
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
picked
up
both
that
and
his
brogues
,
wished
him
a
good
morning
,
and
*NL*
set
off
upon
my
way
,
leaving
him
barefoot
and
disarmed
.
I
chuckled
to
*NL*
myself
as
I
went
,
being
sure
I
was
done
with
that
rogue
,
for
a
variety
*NL*
of
reasons
.
First
,
he
knew
he
could
have
no
more
of
my
money
;
next
,
the
*NL*
brogues
were
worth
in
that
country
only
a
few
pence
;
and
,
lastly
,
the
*NL*
knife
,
which
was
really
a
dagger
,
it
was
against
the
law
for
him
to
*NL*
carry
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
about
half
an
hour
of
walk
,
I
overtook
a
great
,
ragged
man
,
moving
*NL*
pretty
fast
but
feeling
before
him
with
a
staff
.
He
was
quite
blind
,
and
*NL*
told
me
he
was
a
catechist
,
which
should
have
put
me
at
my
ease
.
But
*NL*
his
face
went
against
me
;
it
seemed
dark
and
dangerous
and
secret
;
and
*NL*
presently
,
as
we
began
to
go
on
alongside
,
I
saw
the
steel
butt
of
a
*NL*
pistol
sticking
from
under
the
flap
of
his
coat-pocket
.
To
carry
such
a
*NL*
thing
meant
a
fine
of
fifteen
pounds
sterling
upon
a
first
offence
,
and
*NL*
transportation
to
the
colonies
upon
a
second
.
Nor
could
I
quite
see
why
*NL*
a
religious
teacher
should
go
armed
,
or
what
a
blind
man
could
be
doing
*NL*
with
a
pistol
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
about
my
guide
,
for
I
was
proud
of
what
I
had
done
,
and
my
*NL*
vanity
for
once
got
the
heels
of
my
prudence
.
At
the
mention
of
the
*NL*
five
shillings
he
cried
out
so
loud
that
I
made
up
my
mind
I
should
say
*NL*
nothing
of
the
other
two
,
and
was
glad
he
could
not
see
my
blushes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
it
too
much
?
''
I
asked
,
a
little
faltering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Too
much
!
''
cries
he
.
``
Why
,
I
will
guide
you
to
Torosay
myself
for
a
*NL*
dram
of
brandy
.
And
give
you
the
great
pleasure
of
my
company
-LRB-
me
that
*NL*
is
a
man
of
some
learning
-RRB-
in
the
bargain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
I
did
not
see
how
a
blind
man
could
be
a
guide
;
but
at
that
he
*NL*
laughed
aloud
,
and
said
his
stick
was
eyes
enough
for
an
eagle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
Isle
of
Mull
,
at
least
,
''
says
he
,
``
where
I
know
every
stone
and
*NL*
heather-bush
by
mark
of
head
.
See
,
now
,
''
he
said
,
striking
right
and
*NL*
left
,
as
if
to
make
sure
,
``
down
there
a
burn
is
running
;
and
at
the
head
*NL*
of
it
there
stands
a
bit
of
a
small
hill
with
a
stone
cocked
upon
the
*NL*
top
of
that
;
and
it
's
hard
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
,
that
the
way
runs
by
*NL*
to
Torosay
;
and
the
way
here
,
being
for
droves
,
is
plainly
trodden
,
and
*NL*
will
show
grassy
through
the
heather
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
to
own
he
was
right
in
every
feature
,
and
told
my
wonder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
!
''
says
he
,
``
that
's
nothing
.
Would
ye
believe
me
now
,
that
before
*NL*
the
Act
came
out
,
and
when
there
were
weepons
in
this
country
,
I
could
*NL*
shoot
?
Ay
,
could
I
!
''
cries
he
,
and
then
with
a
leer
:
``
If
ye
had
such
a
*NL*
thing
as
a
pistol
here
to
try
with
,
I
would
show
ye
how
it
's
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
I
had
nothing
of
the
sort
,
and
gave
him
a
wider
berth
.
If
*NL*
he
had
known
,
his
pistol
stuck
at
that
time
quite
plainly
out
of
his
*NL*
pocket
,
and
I
could
see
the
sun
twinkle
on
the
steel
of
the
butt
.
But
*NL*
by
the
better
luck
for
me
,
he
knew
nothing
,
thought
all
was
covered
,
and
*NL*
lied
on
in
the
dark
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
then
began
to
question
me
cunningly
,
where
I
came
from
,
whether
I
*NL*
was
rich
,
whether
I
could
change
a
five-shilling
piece
for
him
-LRB-
which
*NL*
he
declared
he
had
that
moment
in
his
sporran
-RRB-
,
and
all
the
time
he
kept
*NL*
edging
up
to
me
and
I
avoiding
him
.
We
were
now
upon
a
sort
of
green
*NL*
cattle-track
which
crossed
the
hills
towards
Torosay
,
and
we
kept
*NL*
changing
sides
upon
that
like
dancers
in
a
reel
.
I
had
so
plainly
the
*NL*
upper-hand
that
my
spirits
rose
,
and
indeed
I
took
a
pleasure
in
this
*NL*
game
of
blindman
's
buff
;
but
the
catechist
grew
angrier
and
angrier
,
*NL*
and
at
last
began
to
swear
in
Gaelic
and
to
strike
for
my
legs
with
his
*NL*
staff
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
I
told
him
that
,
sure
enough
,
I
had
a
pistol
in
my
pocket
as
well
*NL*
as
he
,
and
if
he
did
not
strike
across
the
hill
due
south
I
would
even
*NL*
blow
his
brains
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
became
at
once
very
polite
,
and
after
trying
to
soften
me
for
some
*NL*
time
,
but
quite
in
vain
,
he
cursed
me
once
more
in
Gaelic
and
took
*NL*
himself
off
.
I
watched
him
striding
along
,
through
bog
and
brier
,
*NL*
tapping
with
his
stick
,
until
he
turned
the
end
of
a
hill
and
*NL*
disappeared
in
the
next
hollow
.
Then
I
struck
on
again
for
Torosay
,
much
*NL*
better
pleased
to
be
alone
than
to
travel
with
that
man
of
learning
.
*NL*
This
was
an
unlucky
day
;
and
these
two
,
of
whom
I
had
just
rid
myself
,
*NL*
one
after
the
other
,
were
the
two
worst
men
I
met
with
in
the
Highlands
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
Torosay
,
on
the
Sound
of
Mull
and
looking
over
to
the
mainland
*NL*
of
Morven
,
there
was
an
inn
with
an
innkeeper
,
who
was
a
Maclean
,
it
*NL*
appeared
,
of
a
very
high
family
;
for
to
keep
an
inn
is
thought
even
more
*NL*
genteel
in
the
Highlands
than
it
is
with
us
,
perhaps
as
partaking
of
*NL*
hospitality
,
or
perhaps
because
the
trade
is
idle
and
drunken
.
He
spoke
*NL*
good
English
,
and
finding
me
to
be
something
of
a
scholar
,
tried
me
*NL*
first
in
French
,
where
he
easily
beat
me
,
and
then
in
the
Latin
,
in
*NL*
which
I
do
n't
know
which
of
us
did
best
.
This
pleasant
rivalry
put
us
at
*NL*
once
upon
friendly
terms
;
and
I
sat
up
and
drank
punch
with
him
-LRB-
or
to
*NL*
be
more
correct
,
sat
up
and
watched
him
drink
it
-RRB-
,
until
he
was
so
tipsy
*NL*
that
he
wept
upon
my
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
tried
him
,
as
if
by
accident
,
with
a
sight
of
Alan
's
button
;
but
it
*NL*
was
plain
he
had
never
seen
or
heard
of
it
.
Indeed
,
he
bore
some
grudge
*NL*
against
the
family
and
friends
of
Ardshiel
,
and
before
he
was
drunk
*NL*
he
read
me
a
lampoon
,
in
very
good
Latin
,
but
with
a
very
ill
meaning
,
*NL*
which
he
had
made
in
elegiac
verses
upon
a
person
of
that
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
told
him
of
my
catechist
,
he
shook
his
head
,
and
said
I
was
lucky
*NL*
to
have
got
clear
off
.
``
That
is
a
very
dangerous
man
,
''
he
said
;
``
Duncan
*NL*
Mackiegh
is
his
name
;
he
can
shoot
by
the
ear
at
several
yards
,
and
has
*NL*
been
often
accused
of
highway
robberies
,
and
once
of
murder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
cream
of
it
is
,
''
says
I
,
``
that
he
called
himself
a
catechist
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
should
he
not
?
''
says
he
,
``
when
that
is
what
he
is
.
It
was
*NL*
Maclean
of
Duart
gave
it
to
him
because
he
was
blind
.
But
perhaps
it
was
*NL*
a
peety
,
''
says
my
host
,
``
for
he
is
always
on
the
road
,
going
from
*NL*
one
place
to
another
to
hear
the
young
folk
say
their
religion
;
and
,
*NL*
doubtless
,
that
is
a
great
temptation
to
the
poor
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
when
my
landlord
could
drink
no
more
,
he
showed
me
to
a
bed
,
*NL*
and
I
lay
down
in
very
good
spirits
;
having
travelled
the
greater
part
*NL*
of
that
big
and
crooked
Island
of
Mull
,
from
Earraid
to
Torosay
,
fifty
*NL*
miles
as
the
crow
flies
,
and
-LRB-
with
my
wanderings
-RRB-
much
nearer
a
hundred
,
*NL*
in
four
days
and
with
little
fatigue
.
Indeed
I
was
by
far
in
better
*NL*
heart
and
health
of
body
at
the
end
of
that
long
tramp
than
I
had
been
*NL*
at
the
beginning
.

CHAPTER
XVI
*NL*
*NL*
THE
LAD
WITH
THE
SILVER
BUTTON
:
ACROSS
MORVEN
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
a
regular
ferry
from
Torosay
to
Kinlochaline
on
the
mainland
.
*NL*
Both
shores
of
the
Sound
are
in
the
country
of
the
strong
clan
of
the
*NL*
Macleans
,
and
the
people
that
passed
the
ferry
with
me
were
almost
all
*NL*
of
that
clan
.
The
skipper
of
the
boat
,
on
the
other
hand
,
was
called
*NL*
Neil
Roy
Macrob
;
and
since
Macrob
was
one
of
the
names
of
Alan
's
*NL*
clansmen
,
and
Alan
himself
had
sent
me
to
that
ferry
,
I
was
eager
to
*NL*
come
to
private
speech
of
Neil
Roy
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
crowded
boat
this
was
of
course
impossible
,
and
the
passage
was
*NL*
a
very
slow
affair
.
There
was
no
wind
,
and
as
the
boat
was
wretchedly
*NL*
equipped
,
we
could
pull
but
two
oars
on
one
side
,
and
one
on
the
other
.
*NL*
The
men
gave
way
,
however
,
with
a
good
will
,
the
passengers
taking
*NL*
spells
to
help
them
,
and
the
whole
company
giving
the
time
in
*NL*
Gaelic
boat-songs
.
And
what
with
the
songs
,
and
the
sea-air
,
and
the
*NL*
good-nature
and
spirit
of
all
concerned
,
and
the
bright
weather
,
the
*NL*
passage
was
a
pretty
thing
to
have
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
was
one
melancholy
part
.
In
the
mouth
of
Loch
Aline
we
found
*NL*
a
great
sea-going
ship
at
anchor
;
and
this
I
supposed
at
first
to
be
one
*NL*
of
the
King
's
cruisers
which
were
kept
along
that
coast
,
both
summer
*NL*
and
winter
,
to
prevent
communication
with
the
French
.
As
we
got
a
little
*NL*
nearer
,
it
became
plain
she
was
a
ship
of
merchandise
;
and
what
still
*NL*
more
puzzled
me
,
not
only
her
decks
,
but
the
sea-beach
also
,
were
quite
*NL*
black
with
people
,
and
skiffs
were
continually
plying
to
and
fro
between
*NL*
them
.
Yet
nearer
,
and
there
began
to
come
to
our
ears
a
great
sound
*NL*
of
mourning
,
the
people
on
board
and
those
on
the
shore
crying
and
*NL*
lamenting
one
to
another
so
as
to
pierce
the
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
I
understood
this
was
an
emigrant
ship
bound
for
the
American
*NL*
colonies
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
put
the
ferry-boat
alongside
,
and
the
exiles
leaned
over
the
*NL*
bulwarks
,
weeping
and
reaching
out
their
hands
to
my
fellow-passengers
,
*NL*
among
whom
they
counted
some
near
friends
.
How
long
this
might
have
gone
*NL*
on
I
do
not
know
,
for
they
seemed
to
have
no
sense
of
time
:
but
at
last
*NL*
the
captain
of
the
ship
,
who
seemed
near
beside
himself
-LRB-
and
no
great
*NL*
wonder
-RRB-
in
the
midst
of
this
crying
and
confusion
,
came
to
the
side
and
*NL*
begged
us
to
depart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thereupon
Neil
sheered
off
;
and
the
chief
singer
in
our
boat
struck
into
*NL*
a
melancholy
air
,
which
was
presently
taken
up
both
by
the
emigrants
and
*NL*
their
friends
upon
the
beach
,
so
that
it
sounded
from
all
sides
like
a
*NL*
lament
for
the
dying
.
I
saw
the
tears
run
down
the
cheeks
of
the
men
and
*NL*
women
in
the
boat
,
even
as
they
bent
at
the
oars
;
and
the
circumstances
*NL*
and
the
music
of
the
song
-LRB-
which
is
one
called
``
Lochaber
no
more
''
-RRB-
were
*NL*
highly
affecting
even
to
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
Kinlochaline
I
got
Neil
Roy
upon
one
side
on
the
beach
,
and
said
I
*NL*
made
sure
he
was
one
of
Appin
's
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
for
no
?
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
seeking
somebody
,
''
said
I
;
``
and
it
comes
in
my
mind
that
you
will
*NL*
have
news
of
him
.
Alan
Breck
Stewart
is
his
name
.
''
And
very
foolishly
,
*NL*
instead
of
showing
him
the
button
,
I
sought
to
pass
a
shilling
in
his
*NL*
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
he
drew
back
.
``
I
am
very
much
affronted
,
''
he
said
;
``
and
this
is
*NL*
not
the
way
that
one
shentleman
should
behave
to
another
at
all
.
The
man
*NL*
you
ask
for
is
in
France
;
but
if
he
was
in
my
sporran
,
''
says
he
,
``
and
*NL*
your
belly
full
of
shillings
,
I
would
not
hurt
a
hair
upon
his
body
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
saw
I
had
gone
the
wrong
way
to
work
,
and
without
wasting
time
upon
*NL*
apologies
,
showed
him
the
button
lying
in
the
hollow
of
my
palm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aweel
,
aweel
,
''
said
Neil
;
``
and
I
think
ye
might
have
begun
with
that
*NL*
end
of
the
stick
,
whatever
!
But
if
ye
are
the
lad
with
the
silver
*NL*
button
,
all
is
well
,
and
I
have
the
word
to
see
that
ye
come
safe
.
But
*NL*
if
ye
will
pardon
me
to
speak
plainly
,
''
says
he
,
``
there
is
a
name
that
*NL*
you
should
never
take
into
your
mouth
,
and
that
is
the
name
of
Alan
*NL*
Breck
;
and
there
is
a
thing
that
ye
would
never
do
,
and
that
is
to
offer
*NL*
your
dirty
money
to
a
Hieland
shentleman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
very
easy
to
apologise
;
for
I
could
scarce
tell
him
-LRB-
what
was
*NL*
the
truth
-RRB-
that
I
had
never
dreamed
he
would
set
up
to
be
a
gentleman
*NL*
until
he
told
me
so
.
Neil
on
his
part
had
no
wish
to
prolong
his
*NL*
dealings
with
me
,
only
to
fulfil
his
orders
and
be
done
with
it
;
and
*NL*
he
made
haste
to
give
me
my
route
.
This
was
to
lie
the
night
in
*NL*
Kinlochaline
in
the
public
inn
;
to
cross
Morven
the
next
day
to
Ardgour
,
*NL*
and
lie
the
night
in
the
house
of
one
John
of
the
Claymore
,
who
was
*NL*
warned
that
I
might
come
;
the
third
day
,
to
be
set
across
one
loch
at
*NL*
Corran
and
another
at
Balachulish
,
and
then
ask
my
way
to
the
house
of
*NL*
James
of
the
Glens
,
at
Aucharn
in
Duror
of
Appin
.
There
was
a
good
deal
*NL*
of
ferrying
,
as
you
hear
;
the
sea
in
all
this
part
running
deep
into
the
*NL*
mountains
and
winding
about
their
roots
.
It
makes
the
country
strong
to
*NL*
hold
and
difficult
to
travel
,
but
full
of
prodigious
wild
and
dreadful
*NL*
prospects
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
some
other
advice
from
Neil
:
to
speak
with
no
one
by
the
way
,
to
*NL*
avoid
Whigs
,
Campbells
,
and
the
``
red-soldiers
;
''
to
leave
the
road
and
*NL*
lie
in
a
bush
if
I
saw
any
of
the
latter
coming
,
``
for
it
was
never
*NL*
chancy
to
meet
in
with
them
;
''
and
in
brief
,
to
conduct
myself
like
a
*NL*
robber
or
a
Jacobite
agent
,
as
perhaps
Neil
thought
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
inn
at
Kinlochaline
was
the
most
beggarly
vile
place
that
ever
pigs
*NL*
were
styed
in
,
full
of
smoke
,
vermin
,
and
silent
Highlanders
.
I
was
not
*NL*
only
discontented
with
my
lodging
,
but
with
myself
for
my
mismanagement
*NL*
of
Neil
,
and
thought
I
could
hardly
be
worse
off
.
But
very
wrongly
,
as
I
*NL*
was
soon
to
see
;
for
I
had
not
been
half
an
hour
at
the
inn
-LRB-
standing
in
*NL*
the
door
most
of
the
time
,
to
ease
my
eyes
from
the
peat
smoke
-RRB-
when
a
*NL*
thunderstorm
came
close
by
,
the
springs
broke
in
a
little
hill
on
which
*NL*
the
inn
stood
,
and
one
end
of
the
house
became
a
running
water
.
Places
*NL*
of
public
entertainment
were
bad
enough
all
over
Scotland
in
those
days
;
*NL*
yet
it
was
a
wonder
to
myself
,
when
I
had
to
go
from
the
fireside
to
the
*NL*
bed
in
which
I
slept
,
wading
over
the
shoes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Early
in
my
next
day
's
journey
I
overtook
a
little
,
stout
,
solemn
man
,
*NL*
walking
very
slowly
with
his
toes
turned
out
,
sometimes
reading
in
*NL*
a
book
and
sometimes
marking
the
place
with
his
finger
,
and
dressed
*NL*
decently
and
plainly
in
something
of
a
clerical
style
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
I
found
to
be
another
catechist
,
but
of
a
different
order
from
the
*NL*
blind
man
of
Mull
:
being
indeed
one
of
those
sent
out
by
the
Edinburgh
*NL*
Society
for
Propagating
Christian
Knowledge
,
to
evangelise
the
more
*NL*
savage
places
of
the
Highlands
.
His
name
was
Henderland
;
he
spoke
with
*NL*
the
broad
south-country
tongue
,
which
I
was
beginning
to
weary
for
the
*NL*
sound
of
;
and
besides
common
countryship
,
we
soon
found
we
had
a
*NL*
more
particular
bond
of
interest
.
For
my
good
friend
,
the
minister
of
*NL*
Essendean
,
had
translated
into
the
Gaelic
in
his
by-time
a
number
of
*NL*
hymns
and
pious
books
which
Henderland
used
in
his
work
,
and
held
in
*NL*
great
esteem
.
Indeed
,
it
was
one
of
these
he
was
carrying
and
reading
*NL*
when
we
met
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
fell
in
company
at
once
,
our
ways
lying
together
as
far
as
to
*NL*
Kingairloch
.
As
we
went
,
he
stopped
and
spoke
with
all
the
wayfarers
*NL*
and
workers
that
we
met
or
passed
;
and
though
of
course
I
could
not
tell
*NL*
what
they
discoursed
about
,
yet
I
judged
Mr.
Henderland
must
be
well
*NL*
liked
in
the
countryside
,
for
I
observed
many
of
them
to
bring
out
their
*NL*
mulls
and
share
a
pinch
of
snuff
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
as
far
in
my
affairs
as
I
judged
wise
;
as
far
,
that
is
,
*NL*
as
they
were
none
of
Alan
's
;
and
gave
Balachulish
as
the
place
I
was
*NL*
travelling
to
,
to
meet
a
friend
;
for
I
thought
Aucharn
,
or
even
Duror
,
*NL*
would
be
too
particular
,
and
might
put
him
on
the
scent
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
his
part
,
he
told
me
much
of
his
work
and
the
people
he
worked
among
,
*NL*
the
hiding
priests
and
Jacobites
,
the
Disarming
Act
,
the
dress
,
and
many
*NL*
other
curiosities
of
the
time
and
place
.
He
seemed
moderate
;
blaming
*NL*
Parliament
in
several
points
,
and
especially
because
they
had
framed
the
*NL*
Act
more
severely
against
those
who
wore
the
dress
than
against
those
*NL*
who
carried
weapons
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
moderation
put
it
in
my
mind
to
question
him
of
the
Red
Fox
and
the
*NL*
Appin
tenants
;
questions
which
,
I
thought
,
would
seem
natural
enough
in
*NL*
the
mouth
of
one
travelling
to
that
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
it
was
a
bad
business
.
``
It
's
wonderful
,
''
said
he
,
``
where
the
*NL*
tenants
find
the
money
,
for
their
life
is
mere
starvation
.
-LRB-
Ye
do
n't
*NL*
carry
such
a
thing
as
snuff
,
do
ye
,
Mr.
Balfour
?
No
.
Well
,
I
'm
better
*NL*
wanting
it
.
-RRB-
But
these
tenants
-LRB-
as
I
was
saying
-RRB-
are
doubtless
partly
*NL*
driven
to
it
.
James
Stewart
in
Duror
-LRB-
that
's
him
they
call
James
of
the
*NL*
Glens
-RRB-
is
half-brother
to
Ardshiel
,
the
captain
of
the
clan
;
and
he
is
*NL*
a
man
much
looked
up
to
,
and
drives
very
hard
.
And
then
there
's
one
they
*NL*
call
Alan
Breck
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
I
cried
,
``
what
of
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
of
the
wind
that
bloweth
where
it
listeth
?
''
said
Henderland
.
``
He
's
*NL*
here
and
awa
;
here
to-day
and
gone
to-morrow
:
a
fair
heather-cat
.
He
*NL*
might
be
glowering
at
the
two
of
us
out
of
yon
whin-bush
,
and
I
wouldnae
*NL*
wonder
!
Ye
'll
no
carry
such
a
thing
as
snuff
,
will
ye
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
no
,
and
that
he
had
asked
the
same
thing
more
than
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
highly
possible
,
''
said
he
,
sighing
.
``
But
it
seems
strange
ye
*NL*
shouldnae
carry
it
.
However
,
as
I
was
saying
,
this
Alan
Breck
is
a
bold
,
*NL*
desperate
customer
,
and
well
kent
to
be
James
's
right
hand
.
His
life
*NL*
is
forfeit
already
;
he
would
boggle
at
naething
;
and
maybe
,
if
a
*NL*
tenant-body
was
to
hang
back
he
would
get
a
dirk
in
his
wame
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
make
a
poor
story
of
it
all
,
Mr.
Henderland
,
''
said
I.
``
If
it
is
all
*NL*
fear
upon
both
sides
,
I
care
to
hear
no
more
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Na
,
''
said
Mr.
Henderland
,
``
but
there
's
love
too
,
and
self-denial
that
*NL*
should
put
the
like
of
you
and
me
to
shame
.
There
's
something
fine
about
*NL*
it
;
no
perhaps
Christian
,
but
humanly
fine
.
Even
Alan
Breck
,
by
all
that
*NL*
I
hear
,
is
a
chield
to
be
respected
.
There
's
many
a
lying
sneck-draw
*NL*
sits
close
in
kirk
in
our
own
part
of
the
country
,
and
stands
well
in
*NL*
the
world
's
eye
,
and
maybe
is
a
far
worse
man
,
Mr.
Balfour
,
than
yon
*NL*
misguided
shedder
of
man
's
blood
.
Ay
,
ay
,
we
might
take
a
lesson
by
*NL*
them
.
--
Ye
'll
perhaps
think
I
've
been
too
long
in
the
Hielands
?
''
he
*NL*
added
,
smiling
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
not
at
all
;
that
I
had
seen
much
to
admire
among
the
*NL*
Highlanders
;
and
if
he
came
to
that
,
Mr.
Campbell
himself
was
a
*NL*
Highlander
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
''
said
he
,
``
that
's
true
.
It
's
a
fine
blood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
is
the
King
's
agent
about
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Colin
Campbell
?
''
says
Henderland
.
``
Putting
his
head
in
a
bees
'
byke
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
to
turn
the
tenants
out
by
force
,
I
hear
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
says
he
,
``
but
the
business
has
gone
back
and
forth
,
as
folk
say
.
*NL*
First
,
James
of
the
Glens
rode
to
Edinburgh
,
and
got
some
lawyer
-LRB-
a
*NL*
Stewart
,
nae
doubt
--
they
all
hing
together
like
bats
in
a
steeple
-RRB-
and
*NL*
had
the
proceedings
stayed
.
And
then
Colin
Campbell
cam
'
in
again
,
and
*NL*
had
the
upper-hand
before
the
Barons
of
Exchequer
.
And
now
they
tell
me
*NL*
the
first
of
the
tenants
are
to
flit
to-morrow
.
It
's
to
begin
at
Duror
*NL*
under
James
's
very
windows
,
which
doesnae
seem
wise
by
my
humble
way
of
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
they
'll
fight
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
says
Henderland
,
``
they
're
disarmed
--
or
supposed
to
be
--
for
*NL*
there
's
still
a
good
deal
of
cold
iron
lying
by
in
quiet
places
.
And
*NL*
then
Colin
Campbell
has
the
sogers
coming
.
But
for
all
that
,
if
I
was
*NL*
his
lady
wife
,
I
wouldnae
be
well
pleased
till
I
got
him
home
again
.
*NL*
They
're
queer
customers
,
the
Appin
Stewarts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
asked
if
they
were
worse
than
their
neighbours
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
they
,
''
said
he
.
``
And
that
's
the
worst
part
of
it
.
For
if
Colin
Roy
*NL*
can
get
his
business
done
in
Appin
,
he
has
it
all
to
begin
again
in
the
*NL*
next
country
,
which
they
call
Mamore
,
and
which
is
one
of
the
countries
*NL*
of
the
Camerons
.
He
's
King
's
Factor
upon
both
,
and
from
both
he
has
to
*NL*
drive
out
the
tenants
;
and
indeed
,
Mr.
Balfour
-LRB-
to
be
open
with
ye
-RRB-
,
*NL*
it
's
my
belief
that
if
he
escapes
the
one
lot
,
he
'll
get
his
death
by
*NL*
the
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
we
continued
talking
and
walking
the
great
part
of
the
day
;
until
*NL*
at
last
,
Mr.
Henderland
after
expressing
his
delight
in
my
company
,
and
*NL*
satisfaction
at
meeting
with
a
friend
of
Mr.
Campbell
's
-LRB-
``
whom
,
''
says
*NL*
he
,
``
I
will
make
bold
to
call
that
sweet
singer
of
our
covenanted
*NL*
Zion
''
-RRB-
,
proposed
that
I
should
make
a
short
stage
,
and
lie
the
night
in
*NL*
his
house
a
little
beyond
Kingairloch
.
To
say
truth
,
I
was
overjoyed
;
*NL*
for
I
had
no
great
desire
for
John
of
the
Claymore
,
and
since
my
double
*NL*
misadventure
,
first
with
the
guide
and
next
with
the
gentleman
skipper
,
*NL*
I
stood
in
some
fear
of
any
Highland
stranger
.
Accordingly
we
shook
*NL*
hands
upon
the
bargain
,
and
came
in
the
afternoon
to
a
small
house
,
*NL*
standing
alone
by
the
shore
of
the
Linnhe
Loch
.
The
sun
was
already
gone
*NL*
from
the
desert
mountains
of
Ardgour
upon
the
hither
side
,
but
shone
on
*NL*
those
of
Appin
on
the
farther
;
the
loch
lay
as
still
as
a
lake
,
only
*NL*
the
gulls
were
crying
round
the
sides
of
it
;
and
the
whole
place
seemed
*NL*
solemn
and
uncouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
no
sooner
come
to
the
door
of
Mr.
Henderland
's
dwelling
,
than
to
*NL*
my
great
surprise
-LRB-
for
I
was
now
used
to
the
politeness
of
Highlanders
-RRB-
*NL*
he
burst
rudely
past
me
,
dashed
into
the
room
,
caught
up
a
jar
and
*NL*
a
small
horn-spoon
,
and
began
ladling
snuff
into
his
nose
in
most
*NL*
excessive
quantities
.
Then
he
had
a
hearty
fit
of
sneezing
,
and
looked
*NL*
round
upon
me
with
a
rather
silly
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
vow
I
took
,
''
says
he
.
``
I
took
a
vow
upon
me
that
I
wouldnae
*NL*
carry
it
.
Doubtless
it
's
a
great
privation
;
but
when
I
think
upon
*NL*
the
martyrs
,
not
only
to
the
Scottish
Covenant
but
to
other
points
of
*NL*
Christianity
,
I
think
shame
to
mind
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
we
had
eaten
-LRB-
and
porridge
and
whey
was
the
best
of
the
good
*NL*
man
's
diet
-RRB-
he
took
a
grave
face
and
said
he
had
a
duty
to
perform
by
*NL*
Mr.
Campbell
,
and
that
was
to
inquire
into
my
state
of
mind
towards
God
.
*NL*
I
was
inclined
to
smile
at
him
since
the
business
of
the
snuff
;
but
he
*NL*
had
not
spoken
long
before
he
brought
the
tears
into
my
eyes
.
There
are
*NL*
two
things
that
men
should
never
weary
of
,
goodness
and
humility
;
we
get
*NL*
none
too
much
of
them
in
this
rough
world
among
cold
,
proud
people
;
but
*NL*
Mr.
Henderland
had
their
very
speech
upon
his
tongue
.
And
though
I
was
a
*NL*
good
deal
puffed
up
with
my
adventures
and
with
having
come
off
,
as
the
*NL*
saying
is
,
with
flying
colours
;
yet
he
soon
had
me
on
my
knees
beside
a
*NL*
simple
,
poor
old
man
,
and
both
proud
and
glad
to
be
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
we
went
to
bed
he
offered
me
sixpence
to
help
me
on
my
way
,
out
*NL*
of
a
scanty
store
he
kept
in
the
turf
wall
of
his
house
;
at
which
excess
*NL*
of
goodness
I
knew
not
what
to
do
.
But
at
last
he
was
so
earnest
with
me
*NL*
that
I
thought
it
the
more
mannerly
part
to
let
him
have
his
way
,
and
so
*NL*
left
him
poorer
than
myself
.

CHAPTER
XVII
*NL*
*NL*
THE
DEATH
OF
THE
RED
FOX
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
Mr.
Henderland
found
for
me
a
man
who
had
a
boat
of
his
own
*NL*
and
was
to
cross
the
Linnhe
Loch
that
afternoon
into
Appin
,
fishing
.
Him
*NL*
he
prevailed
on
to
take
me
,
for
he
was
one
of
his
flock
;
and
in
this
way
*NL*
I
saved
a
long
day
's
travel
and
the
price
of
the
two
public
ferries
I
*NL*
must
otherwise
have
passed
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
near
noon
before
we
set
out
;
a
dark
day
with
clouds
,
and
the
sun
*NL*
shining
upon
little
patches
.
The
sea
was
here
very
deep
and
still
,
*NL*
and
had
scarce
a
wave
upon
it
;
so
that
I
must
put
the
water
to
my
lips
*NL*
before
I
could
believe
it
to
be
truly
salt
.
The
mountains
on
either
side
*NL*
were
high
,
rough
and
barren
,
very
black
and
gloomy
in
the
shadow
of
*NL*
the
clouds
,
but
all
silver-laced
with
little
watercourses
where
the
sun
*NL*
shone
upon
them
.
It
seemed
a
hard
country
,
this
of
Appin
,
for
people
to
*NL*
care
as
much
about
as
Alan
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
but
one
thing
to
mention
.
A
little
after
we
had
started
,
*NL*
the
sun
shone
upon
a
little
moving
clump
of
scarlet
close
in
along
the
*NL*
water-side
to
the
north
.
It
was
much
of
the
same
red
as
soldiers
'
coats
;
*NL*
every
now
and
then
,
too
,
there
came
little
sparks
and
lightnings
,
as
*NL*
though
the
sun
had
struck
upon
bright
steel
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
asked
my
boatman
what
it
should
be
,
and
he
answered
he
supposed
it
was
*NL*
some
of
the
red
soldiers
coming
from
Fort
William
into
Appin
,
against
*NL*
the
poor
tenantry
of
the
country
.
Well
,
it
was
a
sad
sight
to
me
;
*NL*
and
whether
it
was
because
of
my
thoughts
of
Alan
,
or
from
something
*NL*
prophetic
in
my
bosom
,
although
this
was
but
the
second
time
I
had
seen
*NL*
King
George
's
troops
,
I
had
no
good
will
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
we
came
so
near
the
point
of
land
at
the
entering
in
of
Loch
*NL*
Leven
that
I
begged
to
be
set
on
shore
.
My
boatman
-LRB-
who
was
an
honest
*NL*
fellow
and
mindful
of
his
promise
to
the
catechist
-RRB-
would
fain
have
*NL*
carried
me
on
to
Balachulish
;
but
as
this
was
to
take
me
farther
from
my
*NL*
secret
destination
,
I
insisted
,
and
was
set
on
shore
at
last
under
the
*NL*
wood
of
Lettermore
-LRB-
or
Lettervore
,
for
I
have
heard
it
both
ways
-RRB-
in
*NL*
Alan
's
country
of
Appin
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
wood
of
birches
,
growing
on
a
steep
,
craggy
side
of
a
*NL*
mountain
that
overhung
the
loch
.
It
had
many
openings
and
ferny
howes
;
*NL*
and
a
road
or
bridle
track
ran
north
and
south
through
the
midst
of
*NL*
it
,
by
the
edge
of
which
,
where
was
a
spring
,
I
sat
down
to
eat
some
*NL*
oat-bread
of
Mr.
Henderland
's
and
think
upon
my
situation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
I
was
not
only
troubled
by
a
cloud
of
stinging
midges
,
but
far
more
*NL*
by
the
doubts
of
my
mind
.
What
I
ought
to
do
,
why
I
was
going
to
join
*NL*
myself
with
an
outlaw
and
a
would-be
murderer
like
Alan
,
whether
I
*NL*
should
not
be
acting
more
like
a
man
of
sense
to
tramp
back
to
the
south
*NL*
country
direct
,
by
my
own
guidance
and
at
my
own
charges
,
and
what
Mr.
*NL*
Campbell
or
even
Mr.
Henderland
would
think
of
me
if
they
should
ever
*NL*
learn
my
folly
and
presumption
:
these
were
the
doubts
that
now
began
to
*NL*
come
in
on
me
stronger
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
was
so
sitting
and
thinking
,
a
sound
of
men
and
horses
came
to
me
*NL*
through
the
wood
;
and
presently
after
,
at
a
turning
of
the
road
,
I
saw
*NL*
four
travellers
come
into
view
.
The
way
was
in
this
part
so
rough
and
*NL*
narrow
that
they
came
single
and
led
their
horses
by
the
reins
.
The
*NL*
first
was
a
great
,
red-headed
gentleman
,
of
an
imperious
and
flushed
*NL*
face
,
who
carried
his
hat
in
his
hand
and
fanned
himself
,
for
he
was
in
*NL*
a
breathing
heat
.
The
second
,
by
his
decent
black
garb
and
white
wig
,
*NL*
I
correctly
took
to
be
a
lawyer
.
The
third
was
a
servant
,
and
wore
some
*NL*
part
of
his
clothes
in
tartan
,
which
showed
that
his
master
was
of
a
*NL*
Highland
family
,
and
either
an
outlaw
or
else
in
singular
good
odour
*NL*
with
the
Government
,
since
the
wearing
of
tartan
was
against
the
Act
.
If
*NL*
I
had
been
better
versed
in
these
things
,
I
would
have
known
the
tartan
*NL*
to
be
of
the
Argyle
-LRB-
or
Campbell
-RRB-
colours
.
This
servant
had
a
good-sized
*NL*
portmanteau
strapped
on
his
horse
,
and
a
net
of
lemons
-LRB-
to
brew
punch
*NL*
with
-RRB-
hanging
at
the
saddle-bow
;
as
was
often
enough
the
custom
with
*NL*
luxurious
travellers
in
that
part
of
the
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
the
fourth
,
who
brought
up
the
tail
,
I
had
seen
his
like
before
,
*NL*
and
knew
him
at
once
to
be
a
sheriff
's
officer
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
no
sooner
seen
these
people
coming
than
I
made
up
my
mind
-LRB-
for
no
*NL*
reason
that
I
can
tell
-RRB-
to
go
through
with
my
adventure
;
and
when
the
*NL*
first
came
alongside
of
me
,
I
rose
up
from
the
bracken
and
asked
him
the
*NL*
way
to
Aucharn
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stopped
and
looked
at
me
,
as
I
thought
,
a
little
oddly
;
and
then
,
*NL*
turning
to
the
lawyer
,
``
Mungo
,
''
said
he
,
``
there
's
many
a
man
would
think
*NL*
this
more
of
a
warning
than
two
pyats
.
Here
am
I
on
my
road
to
Duror
on
*NL*
the
job
ye
ken
;
and
here
is
a
young
lad
starts
up
out
of
the
bracken
,
*NL*
and
speers
if
I
am
on
the
way
to
Aucharn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Glenure
,
''
said
the
other
,
``
this
is
an
ill
subject
for
jesting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
two
had
now
drawn
close
up
and
were
gazing
at
me
,
while
the
two
*NL*
followers
had
halted
about
a
stone-cast
in
the
rear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
seek
ye
in
Aucharn
?
''
said
Colin
Roy
Campbell
of
Glenure
,
him
*NL*
they
called
the
Red
Fox
;
for
he
it
was
that
I
had
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
man
that
lives
there
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
James
of
the
Glens
,
''
says
Glenure
,
musingly
;
and
then
to
the
lawyer
:
*NL*
``
Is
he
gathering
his
people
,
think
ye
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anyway
,
''
says
the
lawyer
,
``
we
shall
do
better
to
bide
where
we
are
,
and
*NL*
let
the
soldiers
rally
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
are
concerned
for
me
,
''
said
I
,
``
I
am
neither
of
his
people
nor
*NL*
yours
,
but
an
honest
subject
of
King
George
,
owing
no
man
and
fearing
no
*NL*
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
very
well
said
,
''
replies
the
Factor
.
``
But
if
I
may
make
so
bold
as
*NL*
ask
,
what
does
this
honest
man
so
far
from
his
country
?
and
why
does
*NL*
he
come
seeking
the
brother
of
Ardshiel
?
I
have
power
here
,
I
must
tell
*NL*
you
.
I
am
King
's
Factor
upon
several
of
these
estates
,
and
have
twelve
*NL*
files
of
soldiers
at
my
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
heard
a
waif
word
in
the
country
,
''
said
I
,
a
little
nettled
,
*NL*
``
that
you
were
a
hard
man
to
drive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
still
kept
looking
at
me
,
as
if
in
doubt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
he
,
at
last
,
``
your
tongue
is
bold
;
but
I
am
no
unfriend
to
*NL*
plainness
.
If
ye
had
asked
me
the
way
to
the
door
of
James
Stewart
on
*NL*
any
other
day
but
this
,
I
would
have
set
ye
right
and
bidden
ye
God
*NL*
speed
.
But
to-day
--
eh
,
Mungo
?
''
And
he
turned
again
to
look
at
the
*NL*
lawyer
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
just
as
he
turned
there
came
the
shot
of
a
firelock
from
higher
up
*NL*
the
hill
;
and
with
the
very
sound
of
it
Glenure
fell
upon
the
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
I
am
dead
!
''
he
cried
,
several
times
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lawyer
had
caught
him
up
and
held
him
in
his
arms
,
the
servant
*NL*
standing
over
and
clasping
his
hands
.
And
now
the
wounded
man
looked
*NL*
from
one
to
another
with
scared
eyes
,
and
there
was
a
change
in
his
*NL*
voice
,
that
went
to
the
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
care
of
yourselves
,
''
says
he
.
``
I
am
dead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
tried
to
open
his
clothes
as
if
to
look
for
the
wound
,
but
his
*NL*
fingers
slipped
on
the
buttons
.
With
that
he
gave
a
great
sigh
,
his
head
*NL*
rolled
on
his
shoulder
,
and
he
passed
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lawyer
said
never
a
word
,
but
his
face
was
as
sharp
as
a
pen
and
*NL*
as
white
as
the
dead
man
's
;
the
servant
broke
out
into
a
great
noise
of
*NL*
crying
and
weeping
,
like
a
child
;
and
I
,
on
my
side
,
stood
staring
at
*NL*
them
in
a
kind
of
horror
.
The
sheriff
's
officer
had
run
back
at
the
*NL*
first
sound
of
the
shot
,
to
hasten
the
coming
of
the
soldiers
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
the
lawyer
laid
down
the
dead
man
in
his
blood
upon
the
road
,
*NL*
and
got
to
his
own
feet
with
a
kind
of
stagger
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
believe
it
was
his
movement
that
brought
me
to
my
senses
;
for
he
had
*NL*
no
sooner
done
so
than
I
began
to
scramble
up
the
hill
,
crying
out
,
``
The
*NL*
murderer
!
the
murderer
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
little
a
time
had
elapsed
,
that
when
I
got
to
the
top
of
the
first
*NL*
steepness
,
and
could
see
some
part
of
the
open
mountain
,
the
murderer
*NL*
was
still
moving
away
at
no
great
distance
.
He
was
a
big
man
,
in
a
black
*NL*
coat
,
with
metal
buttons
,
and
carried
a
long
fowling-piece
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
!
''
I
cried
.
``
I
see
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
the
murderer
gave
a
little
,
quick
look
over
his
shoulder
,
and
*NL*
began
to
run
.
The
next
moment
he
was
lost
in
a
fringe
of
birches
;
then
*NL*
he
came
out
again
on
the
upper
side
,
where
I
could
see
him
climbing
like
*NL*
a
jackanapes
,
for
that
part
was
again
very
steep
;
and
then
he
dipped
*NL*
behind
a
shoulder
,
and
I
saw
him
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
time
I
had
been
running
on
my
side
,
and
had
got
a
good
way
up
,
*NL*
when
a
voice
cried
upon
me
to
stand
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
at
the
edge
of
the
upper
wood
,
and
so
now
,
when
I
halted
and
*NL*
looked
back
,
I
saw
all
the
open
part
of
the
hill
below
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lawyer
and
the
sheriff
's
officer
were
standing
just
above
the
road
,
*NL*
crying
and
waving
on
me
to
come
back
;
and
on
their
left
,
the
red-coats
,
*NL*
musket
in
hand
,
were
beginning
to
struggle
singly
out
of
the
lower
wood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
I
come
back
?
''
I
cried
.
``
Come
you
on
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ten
pounds
if
ye
take
that
lad
!
''
cried
the
lawyer
.
``
He
's
an
accomplice
.
*NL*
He
was
posted
here
to
hold
us
in
talk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
word
-LRB-
which
I
could
hear
quite
plainly
,
though
it
was
to
the
*NL*
soldiers
and
not
to
me
that
he
was
crying
it
-RRB-
my
heart
came
in
my
mouth
*NL*
with
quite
a
new
kind
of
terror
.
Indeed
,
it
is
one
thing
to
stand
the
*NL*
danger
of
your
life
,
and
quite
another
to
run
the
peril
of
both
life
and
*NL*
character
.
The
thing
,
besides
,
had
come
so
suddenly
,
like
thunder
out
of
*NL*
a
clear
sky
,
that
I
was
all
amazed
and
helpless
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
soldiers
began
to
spread
,
some
of
them
to
run
,
and
others
to
put
up
*NL*
their
pieces
and
cover
me
;
and
still
I
stood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jock
*
in
here
among
the
trees
,
''
said
a
voice
close
by
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
Duck
.
*NL*
*NL*
Indeed
,
I
scarce
knew
what
I
was
doing
,
but
I
obeyed
;
and
as
I
did
so
,
I
*NL*
heard
the
firelocks
bang
and
the
balls
whistle
in
the
birches
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
inside
the
shelter
of
the
trees
I
found
Alan
Breck
standing
,
with
*NL*
a
fishing-rod
.
He
gave
me
no
salutation
;
indeed
it
was
no
time
for
*NL*
civilities
;
only
``
Come
!
''
says
he
,
and
set
off
running
along
the
side
of
*NL*
the
mountain
towards
Balachulish
;
and
I
,
like
a
sheep
,
to
follow
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
we
ran
among
the
birches
;
now
stooping
behind
low
humps
upon
the
*NL*
mountain-side
;
now
crawling
on
all
fours
among
the
heather
.
The
pace
was
*NL*
deadly
:
my
heart
seemed
bursting
against
my
ribs
;
and
I
had
neither
time
*NL*
to
think
nor
breath
to
speak
with
.
Only
I
remember
seeing
with
wonder
,
*NL*
that
Alan
every
now
and
then
would
straighten
himself
to
his
full
height
*NL*
and
look
back
;
and
every
time
he
did
so
,
there
came
a
great
far-away
*NL*
cheering
and
crying
of
the
soldiers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Quarter
of
an
hour
later
,
Alan
stopped
,
clapped
down
flat
in
the
*NL*
heather
,
and
turned
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
he
,
``
it
's
earnest
.
Do
as
I
do
,
for
your
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
at
the
same
speed
,
but
now
with
infinitely
more
precaution
,
we
*NL*
traced
back
again
across
the
mountain-side
by
the
same
way
that
we
had
*NL*
come
,
only
perhaps
higher
;
till
at
last
Alan
threw
himself
down
in
the
*NL*
upper
wood
of
Lettermore
,
where
I
had
found
him
at
the
first
,
and
lay
,
*NL*
with
his
face
in
the
bracken
,
panting
like
a
dog
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
own
sides
so
ached
,
my
head
so
swam
,
my
tongue
so
hung
out
of
my
*NL*
mouth
with
heat
and
dryness
,
that
I
lay
beside
him
like
one
dead
.

I
TALK
WITH
ALAN
IN
THE
WOOD
OF
LETTERMORE
*NL*
*NL*
Alan
was
the
first
to
come
round
.
He
rose
,
went
to
the
border
of
the
*NL*
wood
,
peered
out
a
little
,
and
then
returned
and
sat
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
he
,
``
yon
was
a
hot
burst
,
David
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
nothing
,
nor
so
much
as
lifted
my
face
.
I
had
seen
murder
done
,
*NL*
and
a
great
,
ruddy
,
jovial
gentleman
struck
out
of
life
in
a
moment
;
the
*NL*
pity
of
that
sight
was
still
sore
within
me
,
and
yet
that
was
but
a
part
*NL*
of
my
concern
.
Here
was
murder
done
upon
the
man
Alan
hated
;
here
was
*NL*
Alan
skulking
in
the
trees
and
running
from
the
troops
;
and
whether
his
*NL*
was
the
hand
that
fired
or
only
the
head
that
ordered
,
signified
*NL*
but
little
.
By
my
way
of
it
,
my
only
friend
in
that
wild
country
was
*NL*
blood-guilty
in
the
first
degree
;
I
held
him
in
horror
;
I
could
not
look
*NL*
upon
his
face
;
I
would
have
rather
lain
alone
in
the
rain
on
my
cold
*NL*
isle
,
than
in
that
warm
wood
beside
a
murderer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
ye
still
wearied
?
''
he
asked
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
I
,
still
with
my
face
in
the
bracken
;
``
no
,
I
am
not
wearied
*NL*
now
,
and
I
can
speak
.
You
and
me
must
twine
,
''
*
I
said
.
``
I
liked
you
very
*NL*
well
,
Alan
,
but
your
ways
are
not
mine
,
and
they
're
not
God
's
:
and
the
*NL*
short
and
the
long
of
it
is
just
that
we
must
twine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*
Part
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
hardly
twine
from
ye
,
David
,
without
some
kind
of
reason
for
*NL*
the
same
,
''
said
Alan
,
mighty
gravely
.
``
If
ye
ken
anything
against
*NL*
my
reputation
,
it
's
the
least
thing
that
ye
should
do
,
for
old
*NL*
acquaintance
'
sake
,
to
let
me
hear
the
name
of
it
;
and
if
ye
have
only
*NL*
taken
a
distaste
to
my
society
,
it
will
be
proper
for
me
to
judge
if
I
'm
*NL*
insulted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alan
,
''
said
I
,
``
what
is
the
sense
of
this
?
Ye
ken
very
well
yon
*NL*
Campbell-man
lies
in
his
blood
upon
the
road
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
silent
for
a
little
;
then
says
he
,
``
Did
ever
ye
hear
tell
of
the
*NL*
story
of
the
Man
and
the
Good
People
?
''
--
by
which
he
meant
the
fairies
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
I
,
``
nor
do
I
want
to
hear
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
your
permission
,
Mr.
Balfour
,
I
will
tell
it
you
,
whatever
,
''
says
*NL*
Alan
.
``
The
man
,
ye
should
ken
,
was
cast
upon
a
rock
in
the
sea
,
where
*NL*
it
appears
the
Good
People
were
in
use
to
come
and
rest
as
they
went
*NL*
through
to
Ireland
.
The
name
of
this
rock
is
called
the
Skerryvore
,
and
*NL*
it
's
not
far
from
where
we
suffered
ship-wreck
.
Well
,
it
seems
the
man
*NL*
cried
so
sore
,
if
he
could
just
see
his
little
bairn
before
he
died
!
*NL*
that
at
last
the
king
of
the
Good
People
took
peety
upon
him
,
and
sent
*NL*
one
flying
that
brought
back
the
bairn
in
a
poke
*
and
laid
it
down
*NL*
beside
the
man
where
he
lay
sleeping
.
So
when
the
man
woke
,
there
was
a
*NL*
poke
beside
him
and
something
into
the
inside
of
it
that
moved
.
Well
,
it
*NL*
seems
he
was
one
of
these
gentry
that
think
aye
the
worst
of
things
;
and
*NL*
for
greater
security
,
he
stuck
his
dirk
throughout
that
poke
before
he
*NL*
opened
it
,
and
there
was
his
bairn
dead
.
I
am
thinking
to
myself
,
Mr.
*NL*
Balfour
,
that
you
and
the
man
are
very
much
alike
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*
Bag
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
you
had
no
hand
in
it
?
''
cried
I
,
sitting
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
tell
you
first
of
all
,
Mr.
Balfour
of
Shaws
,
as
one
friend
to
*NL*
another
,
''
said
Alan
,
``
that
if
I
were
going
to
kill
a
gentleman
,
it
would
*NL*
not
be
in
my
own
country
,
to
bring
trouble
on
my
clan
;
and
I
would
not
*NL*
go
wanting
sword
and
gun
,
and
with
a
long
fishing-rod
upon
my
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
I
,
``
that
's
true
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
''
continued
Alan
,
taking
out
his
dirk
and
laying
his
hand
upon
*NL*
it
in
a
certain
manner
,
``
I
swear
upon
the
Holy
Iron
I
had
neither
art
*NL*
nor
part
,
act
nor
thought
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thank
God
for
that
!
''
cried
I
,
and
offered
him
my
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
appear
to
see
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
here
is
a
great
deal
of
work
about
a
Campbell
!
''
said
he
.
``
They
are
*NL*
not
so
scarce
,
that
I
ken
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
least
,
''
said
I
,
``
you
can
not
justly
blame
me
,
for
you
know
very
*NL*
well
what
you
told
me
in
the
brig.
But
the
temptation
and
the
act
are
*NL*
different
,
I
thank
God
again
for
that
.
We
may
all
be
tempted
;
but
*NL*
to
take
a
life
in
cold
blood
,
Alan
!
''
And
I
could
say
no
more
for
the
*NL*
moment
.
``
And
do
you
know
who
did
it
?
''
I
added
.
``
Do
you
know
that
man
in
*NL*
the
black
coat
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
nae
clear
mind
about
his
coat
,
''
said
Alan
cunningly
,
``
but
it
*NL*
sticks
in
my
head
that
it
was
blue
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Blue
or
black
,
did
ye
know
him
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
couldnae
just
conscientiously
swear
to
him
,
''
says
Alan
.
``
He
gaed
very
*NL*
close
by
me
,
to
be
sure
,
but
it
's
a
strange
thing
that
I
should
just
*NL*
have
been
tying
my
brogues
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
swear
that
you
do
n't
know
him
,
Alan
?
''
I
cried
,
half
angered
,
*NL*
half
in
a
mind
to
laugh
at
his
evasions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
yet
,
''
says
he
;
``
but
I
've
a
grand
memory
for
forgetting
,
David
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
there
was
one
thing
I
saw
clearly
,
''
said
I
;
``
and
that
was
,
that
*NL*
you
exposed
yourself
and
me
to
draw
the
soldiers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
very
likely
,
''
said
Alan
;
``
and
so
would
any
gentleman
.
You
and
me
*NL*
were
innocent
of
that
transaction
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
better
reason
,
since
we
were
falsely
suspected
,
that
we
should
get
*NL*
clear
,
''
I
cried
.
``
The
innocent
should
surely
come
before
the
guilty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
David
,
''
said
he
,
``
the
innocent
have
aye
a
chance
to
get
assoiled
*NL*
in
court
;
but
for
the
lad
that
shot
the
bullet
,
I
think
the
best
place
*NL*
for
him
will
be
the
heather
.
Them
that
havenae
dipped
their
hands
in
any
*NL*
little
difficulty
,
should
be
very
mindful
of
the
case
of
them
that
have
.
*NL*
And
that
is
the
good
Christianity
.
For
if
it
was
the
other
way
round
*NL*
about
,
and
the
lad
whom
I
couldnae
just
clearly
see
had
been
in
our
*NL*
shoes
,
and
we
in
his
-LRB-
as
might
very
well
have
been
-RRB-
,
I
think
we
would
be
*NL*
a
good
deal
obliged
to
him
oursel
's
if
he
would
draw
the
soldiers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
it
came
to
this
,
I
gave
Alan
up
.
But
he
looked
so
innocent
all
the
*NL*
time
,
and
was
in
such
clear
good
faith
in
what
he
said
,
and
so
ready
to
*NL*
sacrifice
himself
for
what
he
deemed
his
duty
,
that
my
mouth
was
closed
.
*NL*
Mr.
Henderland
's
words
came
back
to
me
:
that
we
ourselves
might
take
a
*NL*
lesson
by
these
wild
Highlanders
.
Well
,
here
I
had
taken
mine
.
Alan
's
*NL*
morals
were
all
tail-first
;
but
he
was
ready
to
give
his
life
for
them
,
*NL*
such
as
they
were
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alan
,
''
said
I
,
``
I
'll
not
say
it
's
the
good
Christianity
as
I
understand
*NL*
it
,
but
it
's
good
enough
.
And
here
I
offer
ye
my
hand
for
the
second
*NL*
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Whereupon
he
gave
me
both
of
his
,
saying
surely
I
had
cast
a
spell
upon
*NL*
him
,
for
he
could
forgive
me
anything
.
Then
he
grew
very
grave
,
and
said
*NL*
we
had
not
much
time
to
throw
away
,
but
must
both
flee
that
country
:
he
,
*NL*
because
he
was
a
deserter
,
and
the
whole
of
Appin
would
now
be
searched
*NL*
like
a
chamber
,
and
every
one
obliged
to
give
a
good
account
of
himself
;
*NL*
and
I
,
because
I
was
certainly
involved
in
the
murder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
!
''
says
I
,
willing
to
give
him
a
little
lesson
,
``
I
have
no
fear
of
the
*NL*
justice
of
my
country
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
if
this
was
your
country
!
''
said
he
.
``
Or
as
if
ye
would
be
tried
*NL*
here
,
in
a
country
of
Stewarts
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
Scotland
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Man
,
I
whiles
wonder
at
ye
,
''
said
Alan
.
``
This
is
a
Campbell
that
's
been
*NL*
killed
.
Well
,
it
'll
be
tried
in
Inverara
,
the
Campbells
'
head
place
;
*NL*
with
fifteen
Campbells
in
the
jury-box
and
the
biggest
Campbell
of
all
*NL*
-LRB-
and
that
's
the
Duke
-RRB-
sitting
cocking
on
the
bench
.
Justice
,
David
?
*NL*
The
same
justice
,
by
all
the
world
,
as
Glenure
found
awhile
ago
at
the
*NL*
roadside
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
frightened
me
a
little
,
I
confess
,
and
would
have
frightened
me
*NL*
more
if
I
had
known
how
nearly
exact
were
Alan
's
predictions
;
indeed
*NL*
it
was
but
in
one
point
that
he
exaggerated
,
there
being
but
eleven
*NL*
Campbells
on
the
jury
;
though
as
the
other
four
were
equally
in
the
*NL*
Duke
's
dependence
,
it
mattered
less
than
might
appear
.
Still
,
I
cried
*NL*
out
that
he
was
unjust
to
the
Duke
of
Argyle
,
who
-LRB-
for
all
he
was
a
*NL*
Whig
-RRB-
was
yet
a
wise
and
honest
nobleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hoot
!
''
said
Alan
,
``
the
man
's
a
Whig
,
nae
doubt
;
but
I
would
never
deny
*NL*
he
was
a
good
chieftain
to
his
clan
.
And
what
would
the
clan
think
if
*NL*
there
was
a
Campbell
shot
,
and
naebody
hanged
,
and
their
own
chief
*NL*
the
Justice
General
?
But
I
have
often
observed
,
''
says
Alan
,
``
that
you
*NL*
Low-country
bodies
have
no
clear
idea
of
what
's
right
and
wrong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
I
did
at
last
laugh
out
aloud
,
when
to
my
surprise
,
Alan
joined
*NL*
in
,
and
laughed
as
merrily
as
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Na
,
na
,
''
said
he
,
``
we
're
in
the
Hielands
,
David
;
and
when
I
tell
ye
*NL*
to
run
,
take
my
word
and
run
.
Nae
doubt
it
's
a
hard
thing
to
skulk
and
*NL*
starve
in
the
Heather
,
but
it
's
harder
yet
to
lie
shackled
in
a
red-coat
*NL*
prison
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
asked
him
whither
we
should
flee
;
and
as
he
told
me
``
to
the
Lowlands
,
''
*NL*
I
was
a
little
better
inclined
to
go
with
him
;
for
,
indeed
,
I
was
*NL*
growing
impatient
to
get
back
and
have
the
upper-hand
of
my
uncle
.
*NL*
Besides
,
Alan
made
so
sure
there
would
be
no
question
of
justice
in
the
*NL*
matter
,
that
I
began
to
be
afraid
he
might
be
right
.
Of
all
deaths
,
I
*NL*
would
truly
like
least
to
die
by
the
gallows
;
and
the
picture
of
that
*NL*
uncanny
instrument
came
into
my
head
with
extraordinary
clearness
-LRB-
as
I
*NL*
had
once
seen
it
engraved
at
the
top
of
a
pedlar
's
ballad
-RRB-
and
took
away
*NL*
my
appetite
for
courts
of
justice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
chance
it
,
Alan
,
''
said
I.
``
I
'll
go
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
mind
you
,
''
said
Alan
,
``
it
's
no
small
thing
.
Ye
maun
lie
bare
and
*NL*
hard
,
and
brook
many
an
empty
belly
.
Your
bed
shall
be
the
moorcock
's
,
*NL*
and
your
life
shall
be
like
the
hunted
deer
's
,
and
ye
shall
sleep
with
*NL*
your
hand
upon
your
weapons
.
Ay
,
man
,
ye
shall
taigle
many
a
weary
foot
,
*NL*
or
we
get
clear
!
I
tell
ye
this
at
the
start
,
for
it
's
a
life
that
I
ken
*NL*
well
.
But
if
ye
ask
what
other
chance
ye
have
,
I
answer
:
Nane
.
Either
*NL*
take
to
the
heather
with
me
,
or
else
hang
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
's
a
choice
very
easily
made
,
''
said
I
;
and
we
shook
hands
upon
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
let
's
take
another
keek
at
the
red-coats
,
''
says
Alan
,
and
he
*NL*
led
me
to
the
north-eastern
fringe
of
the
wood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Looking
out
between
the
trees
,
we
could
see
a
great
side
of
mountain
,
*NL*
running
down
exceeding
steep
into
the
waters
of
the
loch
.
It
was
a
rough
*NL*
part
,
all
hanging
stone
,
and
heather
,
and
big
scrogs
of
birchwood
;
and
*NL*
away
at
the
far
end
towards
Balachulish
,
little
wee
red
soldiers
were
*NL*
dipping
up
and
down
over
hill
and
howe
,
and
growing
smaller
every
*NL*
minute
.
There
was
no
cheering
now
,
for
I
think
they
had
other
uses
*NL*
for
what
breath
was
left
them
;
but
they
still
stuck
to
the
trail
,
and
*NL*
doubtless
thought
that
we
were
close
in
front
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alan
watched
them
,
smiling
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
''
said
he
,
``
they
'll
be
gey
weary
before
they
've
got
to
the
end
of
*NL*
that
employ
!
And
so
you
and
me
,
David
,
can
sit
down
and
eat
a
bite
,
and
*NL*
breathe
a
bit
longer
,
and
take
a
dram
from
my
bottle
.
Then
we
'll
strike
*NL*
for
Aucharn
,
the
house
of
my
kinsman
,
James
of
the
Glens
,
where
I
must
*NL*
get
my
clothes
,
and
my
arms
,
and
money
to
carry
us
along
;
and
then
,
*NL*
David
,
we
'll
cry
,
`
Forth
,
Fortune
!
'
and
take
a
cast
among
the
heather
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
we
sat
again
and
ate
and
drank
,
in
a
place
whence
we
could
see
the
*NL*
sun
going
down
into
a
field
of
great
,
wild
,
and
houseless
mountains
,
*NL*
such
as
I
was
now
condemned
to
wander
in
with
my
companion
.
Partly
as
*NL*
we
so
sat
,
and
partly
afterwards
,
on
the
way
to
Aucharn
,
each
of
us
*NL*
narrated
his
adventures
;
and
I
shall
here
set
down
so
much
of
Alan
's
as
*NL*
seems
either
curious
or
needful
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
appears
he
ran
to
the
bulwarks
as
soon
as
the
wave
was
passed
;
saw
*NL*
me
,
and
lost
me
,
and
saw
me
again
,
as
I
tumbled
in
the
roost
;
and
at
*NL*
last
had
one
glimpse
of
me
clinging
on
the
yard
.
It
was
this
that
put
*NL*
him
in
some
hope
I
would
maybe
get
to
land
after
all
,
and
made
him
leave
*NL*
those
clues
and
messages
which
had
brought
me
-LRB-
for
my
sins
-RRB-
to
that
*NL*
unlucky
country
of
Appin
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meanwhile
,
those
still
on
the
brig
had
got
the
skiff
launched
,
*NL*
and
one
or
two
were
on
board
of
her
already
,
when
there
came
a
second
*NL*
wave
greater
than
the
first
,
and
heaved
the
brig
out
of
her
place
,
and
*NL*
would
certainly
have
sent
her
to
the
bottom
,
had
she
not
struck
and
*NL*
caught
on
some
projection
of
the
reef
.
When
she
had
struck
first
,
it
had
*NL*
been
bows-on
,
so
that
the
stern
had
hitherto
been
lowest
.
But
now
her
*NL*
stern
was
thrown
in
the
air
,
and
the
bows
plunged
under
the
sea
;
and
*NL*
with
that
,
the
water
began
to
pour
into
the
fore-scuttle
like
the
*NL*
pouring
of
a
mill-dam
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
took
the
colour
out
of
Alan
's
face
,
even
to
tell
what
followed
.
*NL*
For
there
were
still
two
men
lying
impotent
in
their
bunks
;
and
these
,
*NL*
seeing
the
water
pour
in
and
thinking
the
ship
had
foundered
,
began
to
*NL*
cry
out
aloud
,
and
that
with
such
harrowing
cries
that
all
who
were
on
*NL*
deck
tumbled
one
after
another
into
the
skiff
and
fell
to
their
oars
.
*NL*
They
were
not
two
hundred
yards
away
,
when
there
came
a
third
great
sea
;
*NL*
and
at
that
the
brig
lifted
clean
over
the
reef
;
her
canvas
filled
for
*NL*
a
moment
,
and
she
seemed
to
sail
in
chase
of
them
,
but
settling
all
the
*NL*
while
;
and
presently
she
drew
down
and
down
,
as
if
a
hand
was
drawing
*NL*
her
;
and
the
sea
closed
over
the
Covenant
of
Dysart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Never
a
word
they
spoke
as
they
pulled
ashore
,
being
stunned
with
the
*NL*
horror
of
that
screaming
;
but
they
had
scarce
set
foot
upon
the
beach
*NL*
when
Hoseason
woke
up
,
as
if
out
of
a
muse
,
and
bade
them
lay
hands
upon
*NL*
Alan
.
They
hung
back
indeed
,
having
little
taste
for
the
employment
;
*NL*
but
Hoseason
was
like
a
fiend
,
crying
that
Alan
was
alone
,
that
he
had
*NL*
a
great
sum
about
him
,
that
he
had
been
the
means
of
losing
the
brig
and
*NL*
drowning
all
their
comrades
,
and
that
here
was
both
revenge
and
wealth
*NL*
upon
a
single
cast
.
It
was
seven
against
one
;
in
that
part
of
the
shore
*NL*
there
was
no
rock
that
Alan
could
set
his
back
to
;
and
the
sailors
began
*NL*
to
spread
out
and
come
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then
,
''
said
Alan
,
``
the
little
man
with
the
red
head
--
I
havenae
mind
*NL*
of
the
name
that
he
is
called
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Riach
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
''
said
Alan
,
``
Riach
!
Well
,
it
was
him
that
took
up
the
clubs
for
me
,
*NL*
asked
the
men
if
they
werenae
feared
of
a
judgment
,
and
,
says
he
`
Dod
,
*NL*
I
'll
put
my
back
to
the
Hielandman
's
mysel
'
.
'
That
's
none
such
an
*NL*
entirely
bad
little
man
,
yon
little
man
with
the
red
head
,
''
said
Alan
.
*NL*
``
He
has
some
spunks
of
decency
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
I
,
``
he
was
kind
to
me
in
his
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
he
was
to
Alan
,
''
said
he
;
``
and
by
my
troth
,
I
found
his
way
a
*NL*
very
good
one
!
But
ye
see
,
David
,
the
loss
of
the
ship
and
the
cries
of
*NL*
these
poor
lads
sat
very
ill
upon
the
man
;
and
I
'm
thinking
that
would
*NL*
be
the
cause
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
would
think
so
,
''
says
I
;
``
for
he
was
as
keen
as
any
of
the
rest
*NL*
at
the
beginning
.
But
how
did
Hoseason
take
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
sticks
in
my
mind
that
he
would
take
it
very
ill
,
''
says
Alan
.
``
But
*NL*
the
little
man
cried
to
me
to
run
,
and
indeed
I
thought
it
was
a
good
*NL*
observe
,
and
ran
.
The
last
that
I
saw
they
were
all
in
a
knot
upon
the
*NL*
beach
,
like
folk
that
were
not
agreeing
very
well
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
by
that
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
the
fists
were
going
,
''
said
Alan
;
``
and
I
saw
one
man
go
down
like
*NL*
a
pair
of
breeks
.
But
I
thought
it
would
be
better
no
to
wait
.
Ye
see
*NL*
there
's
a
strip
of
Campbells
in
that
end
of
Mull
,
which
is
no
good
*NL*
company
for
a
gentleman
like
me
.
If
it
hadnae
been
for
that
I
would
have
*NL*
waited
and
looked
for
ye
mysel
'
,
let
alone
giving
a
hand
to
the
little
*NL*
man
.
''
-LRB-
It
was
droll
how
Alan
dwelt
on
Mr.
Riach
's
stature
,
for
,
to
say
*NL*
the
truth
,
the
one
was
not
much
smaller
than
the
other
.
-RRB-
``
So
,
''
says
he
,
*NL*
continuing
,
``
I
set
my
best
foot
forward
,
and
whenever
I
met
in
with
any
*NL*
one
I
cried
out
there
was
a
wreck
ashore
.
Man
,
they
didnae
stop
to
fash
*NL*
with
me
!
Ye
should
have
seen
them
linking
for
the
beach
!
And
when
they
*NL*
got
there
they
found
they
had
had
the
pleasure
of
a
run
,
which
is
aye
*NL*
good
for
a
Campbell
.
I
'm
thinking
it
was
a
judgment
on
the
clan
that
the
*NL*
brig
went
down
in
the
lump
and
didnae
break
.
But
it
was
a
very
unlucky
*NL*
thing
for
you
,
that
same
;
for
if
any
wreck
had
come
ashore
they
would
*NL*
have
hunted
high
and
low
,
and
would
soon
have
found
ye

CHAPTER
XIX
*NL*
*NL*
THE
HOUSE
OF
FEAR
*NL*
*NL*
Night
fell
as
we
were
walking
,
and
the
clouds
,
which
had
broken
up
in
*NL*
the
afternoon
,
settled
in
and
thickened
,
so
that
it
fell
,
for
the
*NL*
season
of
the
year
,
extremely
dark
.
The
way
we
went
was
over
rough
*NL*
mountainsides
;
and
though
Alan
pushed
on
with
an
assured
manner
,
I
could
*NL*
by
no
means
see
how
he
directed
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
about
half-past
ten
of
the
clock
,
we
came
to
the
top
of
a
brae
,
*NL*
and
saw
lights
below
us
.
It
seemed
a
house
door
stood
open
and
let
out
a
*NL*
beam
of
fire
and
candle-light
;
and
all
round
the
house
and
steading
*NL*
five
or
six
persons
were
moving
hurriedly
about
,
each
carrying
a
lighted
*NL*
brand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
James
must
have
tint
his
wits
,
''
said
Alan
.
``
If
this
was
the
soldiers
*NL*
instead
of
you
and
me
,
he
would
be
in
a
bonny
mess
.
But
I
dare
say
he
'll
*NL*
have
a
sentry
on
the
road
,
and
he
would
ken
well
enough
no
soldiers
*NL*
would
find
the
way
that
we
came
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hereupon
he
whistled
three
times
,
in
a
particular
manner
.
It
was
strange
*NL*
to
see
how
,
at
the
first
sound
of
it
,
all
the
moving
torches
came
to
*NL*
a
stand
,
as
if
the
bearers
were
affrighted
;
and
how
,
at
the
third
,
the
*NL*
bustle
began
again
as
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
thus
set
folks
'
minds
at
rest
,
we
came
down
the
brae
,
and
were
*NL*
met
at
the
yard
gate
-LRB-
for
this
place
was
like
a
well-doing
farm
-RRB-
by
*NL*
a
tall
,
handsome
man
of
more
than
fifty
,
who
cried
out
to
Alan
in
the
*NL*
Gaelic
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
James
Stewart
,
''
said
Alan
,
``
I
will
ask
ye
to
speak
in
Scotch
,
for
here
*NL*
is
a
young
gentleman
with
me
that
has
nane
of
the
other
.
This
is
him
,
''
*NL*
he
added
,
putting
his
arm
through
mine
,
``
a
young
gentleman
of
the
*NL*
Lowlands
,
and
a
laird
in
his
country
too
,
but
I
am
thinking
it
will
be
*NL*
the
better
for
his
health
if
we
give
his
name
the
go-by
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
James
of
the
Glens
turned
to
me
for
a
moment
,
and
greeted
me
courteously
*NL*
enough
;
the
next
he
had
turned
to
Alan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
has
been
a
dreadful
accident
,
''
he
cried
.
``
It
will
bring
trouble
on
*NL*
the
country
.
''
And
he
wrung
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hoots
!
''
said
Alan
,
``
ye
must
take
the
sour
with
the
sweet
,
man
.
Colin
*NL*
Roy
is
dead
,
and
be
thankful
for
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
''
said
James
,
``
and
by
my
troth
,
I
wish
he
was
alive
again
!
It
's
all
*NL*
very
fine
to
blow
and
boast
beforehand
;
but
now
it
's
done
,
Alan
;
and
*NL*
who
's
to
bear
the
wyte
*
of
it
?
The
accident
fell
out
in
Appin
--
mind
ye
*NL*
that
,
Alan
;
it
's
Appin
that
must
pay
;
and
I
am
a
man
that
has
a
family
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*
Blame
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
this
was
going
on
I
looked
about
me
at
the
servants
.
Some
were
on
*NL*
ladders
,
digging
in
the
thatch
of
the
house
or
the
farm
buildings
,
*NL*
from
which
they
brought
out
guns
,
swords
,
and
different
weapons
of
*NL*
war
;
others
carried
them
away
;
and
by
the
sound
of
mattock
blows
from
*NL*
somewhere
farther
down
the
brae
,
I
suppose
they
buried
them
.
Though
they
*NL*
were
all
so
busy
,
there
prevailed
no
kind
of
order
in
their
efforts
;
men
*NL*
struggled
together
for
the
same
gun
and
ran
into
each
other
with
their
*NL*
burning
torches
;
and
James
was
continually
turning
about
from
his
talk
*NL*
with
Alan
,
to
cry
out
orders
which
were
apparently
never
understood
.
The
*NL*
faces
in
the
torchlight
were
like
those
of
people
overborne
with
hurry
*NL*
and
panic
;
and
though
none
spoke
above
his
breath
,
their
speech
sounded
*NL*
both
anxious
and
angry
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
about
this
time
that
a
lassie
came
out
of
the
house
carrying
*NL*
a
pack
or
bundle
;
and
it
has
often
made
me
smile
to
think
how
Alan
's
*NL*
instinct
awoke
at
the
mere
sight
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
that
the
lassie
has
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
're
just
setting
the
house
in
order
,
Alan
,
''
said
James
,
in
his
*NL*
frightened
and
somewhat
fawning
way
.
``
They
'll
search
Appin
with
candles
,
*NL*
and
we
must
have
all
things
straight
.
We
're
digging
the
bit
guns
and
*NL*
swords
into
the
moss
,
ye
see
;
and
these
,
I
am
thinking
,
will
be
your
ain
*NL*
French
clothes
.
We
'll
be
to
bury
them
,
I
believe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bury
my
French
clothes
!
''
cried
Alan
.
``
Troth
,
no
!
''
And
he
laid
hold
upon
*NL*
the
packet
and
retired
into
the
barn
to
shift
himself
,
recommending
me
*NL*
in
the
meanwhile
to
his
kinsman
.
*NL*
*NL*
James
carried
me
accordingly
into
the
kitchen
,
and
sat
down
with
me
at
*NL*
table
,
smiling
and
talking
at
first
in
a
very
hospitable
manner
.
But
*NL*
presently
the
gloom
returned
upon
him
;
he
sat
frowning
and
biting
his
*NL*
fingers
;
only
remembered
me
from
time
to
time
;
and
then
gave
me
but
a
*NL*
word
or
two
and
a
poor
smile
,
and
back
into
his
private
terrors
.
His
*NL*
wife
sat
by
the
fire
and
wept
,
with
her
face
in
her
hands
;
his
eldest
*NL*
son
was
crouched
upon
the
floor
,
running
over
a
great
mass
of
papers
and
*NL*
now
and
again
setting
one
alight
and
burning
it
to
the
bitter
end
;
all
*NL*
the
while
a
servant
lass
with
a
red
face
was
rummaging
about
the
room
,
*NL*
in
a
blind
hurry
of
fear
,
and
whimpering
as
she
went
;
and
every
now
and
*NL*
again
one
of
the
men
would
thrust
in
his
face
from
the
yard
,
and
cry
for
*NL*
orders
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
James
could
keep
his
seat
no
longer
,
and
begged
my
permission
to
*NL*
be
so
unmannerly
as
walk
about
.
``
I
am
but
poor
company
altogether
,
sir
,
''
*NL*
says
he
,
``
but
I
can
think
of
nothing
but
this
dreadful
accident
,
and
the
*NL*
trouble
it
is
like
to
bring
upon
quite
innocent
persons
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
little
after
he
observed
his
son
burning
a
paper
which
he
thought
*NL*
should
have
been
kept
;
and
at
that
his
excitement
burst
out
so
that
it
*NL*
was
painful
to
witness
.
He
struck
the
lad
repeatedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
gone
gyte
?
''
*
he
cried
.
``
Do
you
wish
to
hang
your
father
?
''
and
*NL*
forgetful
of
my
presence
,
carried
on
at
him
a
long
time
together
in
the
*NL*
Gaelic
,
the
young
man
answering
nothing
;
only
the
wife
,
at
the
name
of
*NL*
hanging
,
throwing
her
apron
over
her
face
and
sobbing
out
louder
than
*NL*
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
Mad
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
all
wretched
for
a
stranger
like
myself
to
hear
and
see
;
and
*NL*
I
was
right
glad
when
Alan
returned
,
looking
like
himself
in
his
fine
*NL*
French
clothes
,
though
-LRB-
to
be
sure
-RRB-
they
were
now
grown
almost
too
*NL*
battered
and
withered
to
deserve
the
name
of
fine
.
I
was
then
taken
out
*NL*
in
my
turn
by
another
of
the
sons
,
and
given
that
change
of
clothing
of
*NL*
which
I
had
stood
so
long
in
need
,
and
a
pair
of
Highland
brogues
made
*NL*
of
deer-leather
,
rather
strange
at
first
,
but
after
a
little
practice
*NL*
very
easy
to
the
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
time
I
came
back
Alan
must
have
told
his
story
;
for
it
seemed
*NL*
understood
that
I
was
to
fly
with
him
,
and
they
were
all
busy
upon
our
*NL*
equipment
.
They
gave
us
each
a
sword
and
pistols
,
though
I
professed
my
*NL*
inability
to
use
the
former
;
and
with
these
,
and
some
ammunition
,
a
bag
*NL*
of
oatmeal
,
an
iron
pan
,
and
a
bottle
of
right
French
brandy
,
we
were
*NL*
ready
for
the
heather
.
Money
,
indeed
,
was
lacking
.
I
had
about
two
*NL*
guineas
left
;
Alan
's
belt
having
been
despatched
by
another
hand
,
that
*NL*
trusty
messenger
had
no
more
than
seventeen-pence
to
his
whole
fortune
;
*NL*
and
as
for
James
,
it
appears
he
had
brought
himself
so
low
with
journeys
*NL*
to
Edinburgh
and
legal
expenses
on
behalf
of
the
tenants
,
that
he
could
*NL*
only
scrape
together
three-and-five-pence-halfpenny
,
the
most
of
it
in
*NL*
coppers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
'll
no
do
,
''
said
Alan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye
must
find
a
safe
bit
somewhere
near
by
,
''
said
James
,
``
and
get
word
*NL*
sent
to
me
.
Ye
see
,
ye
'll
have
to
get
this
business
prettily
off
,
Alan
.
*NL*
This
is
no
time
to
be
stayed
for
a
guinea
or
two
.
They
're
sure
to
get
*NL*
wind
of
ye
,
sure
to
seek
ye
,
and
by
my
way
of
it
,
sure
to
lay
on
ye
the
*NL*
wyte
of
this
day
's
accident
.
If
it
falls
on
you
,
it
falls
on
me
that
am
*NL*
your
near
kinsman
and
harboured
ye
while
ye
were
in
the
country
.
And
if
*NL*
it
comes
on
me
--
''
he
paused
,
and
bit
his
fingers
,
with
a
white
face
.
*NL*
``
It
would
be
a
painful
thing
for
our
friends
if
I
was
to
hang
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
an
ill
day
for
Appin
,
''
says
Alan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
day
that
sticks
in
my
throat
,
''
said
James
.
``
O
man
,
man
,
man
--
man
*NL*
Alan
!
you
and
me
have
spoken
like
two
fools
!
''
he
cried
,
striking
his
*NL*
hand
upon
the
wall
so
that
the
house
rang
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
that
's
true
,
too
,
''
said
Alan
;
``
and
my
friend
from
the
*NL*
Lowlands
here
''
-LRB-
nodding
at
me
-RRB-
``
gave
me
a
good
word
upon
that
head
,
if
I
*NL*
would
only
have
listened
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
see
here
,
''
said
James
,
returning
to
his
former
manner
,
``
if
they
lay
*NL*
me
by
the
heels
,
Alan
,
it
's
then
that
you
'll
be
needing
the
money
.
For
*NL*
with
all
that
I
have
said
and
that
you
have
said
,
it
will
look
very
*NL*
black
against
the
two
of
us
;
do
ye
mark
that
?
Well
,
follow
me
out
,
and
*NL*
ye
'll
,
I
'll
see
that
I
'll
have
to
get
a
paper
out
against
ye
mysel

;
*NL*
have
to
offer
a
reward
for
ye
;
ay
,
will
I
!
It
's
a
sore
thing
to
do
*NL*
between
such
near
friends
;
but
if
I
get
the
dirdum
*
of
this
dreadful
*NL*
accident
,
I
'll
have
to
fend
for
myself
,
man
.
Do
ye
see
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
*
Blame
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
spoke
with
a
pleading
earnestness
,
taking
Alan
by
the
breast
of
the
*NL*
coat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
''
said
Alan
,
``
I
see
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
ye
'll
have
to
be
clear
of
the
country
,
Alan
--
ay
,
and
clear
of
*NL*
Scotland
--
you
and
your
friend
from
the
Lowlands
,
too
.
For
I
'll
have
to
*NL*
paper
your
friend
from
the
Lowlands
.
Ye
see
that
,
Alan
--
say
that
ye
see
*NL*
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
Alan
flushed
a
bit
.
``
This
is
unco
hard
on
me
that
brought
him
*NL*
here
,
James
,
''
said
he
,
throwing
his
head
back
.
``
It
's
like
making
me
a
*NL*
traitor
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Alan
,
man
!
''
cried
James
.
``
Look
things
in
the
face
!
He
'll
be
*NL*
papered
anyway
;
Mungo
Campbell
'll
be
sure
to
paper
him
;
what
matters
*NL*
if
I
paper
him
too
?
And
then
,
Alan
,
I
am
a
man
that
has
a
family
.
''
And
*NL*
then
,
after
a
little
pause
on
both
sides
,
``
And
,
Alan
,
it
'll
be
a
jury
of
*NL*
Campbells
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
one
thing
,
''
said
Alan
,
musingly
,
``
that
naebody
kens
his
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
yet
they
shallnae
,
Alan
!
There
's
my
hand
on
that
,
''
cried
James
,
for
*NL*
all
the
world
as
if
he
had
really
known
my
name
and
was
foregoing
some
*NL*
advantage
.
``
But
just
the
habit
he
was
in
,
and
what
he
looked
like
,
and
*NL*
his
age
,
and
the
like
?
I
couldnae
well
do
less
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
at
your
father
's
son
,
''
cried
Alan
,
sternly
.
``
Would
ye
sell
the
*NL*
lad
with
a
gift
?
Would
ye
change
his
clothes
and
then
betray
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
Alan
,
''
said
James
.
``
No
,
no
:
the
habit
he
took
off
--
the
habit
*NL*
Mungo
saw
him
in
.
''
But
I
thought
he
seemed
crestfallen
;
indeed
,
he
was
*NL*
clutching
at
every
straw
,
and
all
the
time
,
I
dare
say
,
saw
the
faces
of
*NL*
his
hereditary
foes
on
the
bench
,
and
in
the
jury-box
,
and
the
gallows
*NL*
in
the
background
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
''
says
Alan
,
turning
to
me
,
``
what
say
ye
to
that
?
Ye
are
here
*NL*
under
the
safeguard
of
my
honour
;
and
it
's
my
part
to
see
nothing
done
*NL*
but
what
shall
please
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
but
one
word
to
say
,
''
said
I
;
``
for
to
all
this
dispute
I
am
a
*NL*
perfect
stranger
.
But
the
plain
common-sense
is
to
set
the
blame
where
*NL*
it
belongs
,
and
that
is
on
the
man
who
fired
the
shot
.
Paper
him
,
as
ye
*NL*
call
it
,
set
the
hunt
on
him
;
and
let
honest
,
innocent
folk
show
their
*NL*
faces
in
safety
.
''
But
at
this
both
Alan
and
James
cried
out
in
horror
;
*NL*
bidding
me
hold
my
tongue
,
for
that
was
not
to
be
thought
of
;
and
asking
*NL*
me
what
the
Camerons
would
think
?
-LRB-
which
confirmed
me
,
it
must
have
been
*NL*
a
Cameron
from
Mamore
that
did
the
act
-RRB-
and
if
I
did
not
see
that
the
*NL*
lad
might
be
caught
?
``
Ye
havenae
surely
thought
of
that
?
''
said
they
,
*NL*
with
such
innocent
earnestness
,
that
my
hands
dropped
at
my
side
and
I
*NL*
despaired
of
argument
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
then
,
''
said
I
,
``
paper
me
,
if
you
please
,
paper
Alan
,
paper
*NL*
King
George
!
We
're
all
three
innocent
,
and
that
seems
to
be
what
's
*NL*
wanted
.
But
at
least
,
sir
,
''
said
I
to
James
,
recovering
from
my
little
*NL*
fit
of
annoyance
,
``
I
am
Alan
's
friend
,
and
if
I
can
be
helpful
to
*NL*
friends
of
his
,
I
will
not
stumble
at
the
risk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
it
best
to
put
a
fair
face
on
my
consent
,
for
I
saw
Alan
*NL*
troubled
;
and
,
besides
-LRB-
thinks
I
to
myself
-RRB-
,
as
soon
as
my
back
is
*NL*
turned
,
they
will
paper
me
,
as
they
call
it
,
whether
I
consent
or
not
.
*NL*
But
in
this
I
saw
I
was
wrong
;
for
I
had
no
sooner
said
the
words
,
than
*NL*
Mrs.
Stewart
leaped
out
of
her
chair
,
came
running
over
to
us
,
and
wept
*NL*
first
upon
my
neck
and
then
on
Alan
's
,
blessing
God
for
our
goodness
to
*NL*
her
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
for
you
,
Alan
,
it
was
no
more
than
your
bounden
duty
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
``
But
for
this
lad
that
has
come
here
and
seen
us
at
our
worst
,
and
seen
*NL*
the
goodman
fleeching
like
a
suitor
,
him
that
by
rights
should
give
his
*NL*
commands
like
any
king
--
as
for
you
,
my
lad
,
''
she
says
,
``
my
heart
is
wae
*NL*
not
to
have
your
name
,
but
I
have
your
face
;
and
as
long
as
my
heart
*NL*
beats
under
my
bosom
,
I
will
keep
it
,
and
think
of
it
,
and
bless
it
.
''
*NL*
And
with
that
she
kissed
me
,
and
burst
once
more
into
such
sobbing
,
that
*NL*
I
stood
abashed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hoot
,
hoot
,
''
said
Alan
,
looking
mighty
silly
.
``
The
day
comes
unco
soon
*NL*
in
this
month
of
July
;
and
to-morrow
there
'll
be
a
fine
to-do
in
Appin
,
*NL*
a
fine
riding
of
dragoons
,
and
crying
of
`
Cruachan
!
'
*
and
running
of
*NL*
red-coats
;
and
it
behoves
you
and
me
to
the
sooner
be
gone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*
The
rallying-word
of
the
Campbells
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thereupon
we
said
farewell
,
and
set
out
again
,
bending
somewhat
*NL*
eastwards
,
in
a
fine
mild
dark
night
,
and
over
much
the
same
broken
*NL*
country
as
before
.

CHAPTER
XX
*NL*
*NL*
THE
FLIGHT
IN
THE
HEATHER
:
THE
ROCKS
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
we
walked
,
sometimes
ran
;
and
as
it
drew
on
to
morning
,
walked
*NL*
ever
the
less
and
ran
the
more
.
Though
,
upon
its
face
,
that
country
*NL*
appeared
to
be
a
desert
,
yet
there
were
huts
and
houses
of
the
people
,
*NL*
of
which
we
must
have
passed
more
than
twenty
,
hidden
in
quiet
places
of
*NL*
the
hills
.
When
we
came
to
one
of
these
,
Alan
would
leave
me
in
the
way
,
*NL*
and
go
himself
and
rap
upon
the
side
of
the
house
and
speak
awhile
at
*NL*
the
window
with
some
sleeper
awakened
.
This
was
to
pass
the
news
;
which
,
*NL*
in
that
country
,
was
so
much
of
a
duty
that
Alan
must
pause
to
attend
to
*NL*
it
even
while
fleeing
for
his
life
;
and
so
well
attended
to
by
others
,
*NL*
that
in
more
than
half
of
the
houses
where
we
called
they
had
heard
*NL*
already
of
the
murder
.
In
the
others
,
as
well
as
I
could
make
out
*NL*
-LRB-
standing
back
at
a
distance
and
hearing
a
strange
tongue
-RRB-
,
the
news
was
*NL*
received
with
more
of
consternation
than
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
all
our
hurry
,
day
began
to
come
in
while
we
were
still
far
from
any
*NL*
shelter
.
It
found
us
in
a
prodigious
valley
,
strewn
with
rocks
and
where
*NL*
ran
a
foaming
river
.
Wild
mountains
stood
around
it
;
there
grew
there
*NL*
neither
grass
nor
trees
;
and
I
have
sometimes
thought
since
then
,
that
*NL*
it
may
have
been
the
valley
called
Glencoe
,
where
the
massacre
was
in
*NL*
the
time
of
King
William
.
But
for
the
details
of
our
itinerary
,
I
am
all
*NL*
to
seek
;
our
way
lying
now
by
short
cuts
,
now
by
great
detours
;
our
pace
*NL*
being
so
hurried
,
our
time
of
journeying
usually
by
night
;
and
the
names
*NL*
of
such
places
as
I
asked
and
heard
being
in
the
Gaelic
tongue
and
the
*NL*
more
easily
forgotten
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
peep
of
morning
,
then
,
showed
us
this
horrible
place
,
and
I
*NL*
could
see
Alan
knit
his
brow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
no
fit
place
for
you
and
me
,
''
he
said
.
``
This
is
a
place
they
're
*NL*
bound
to
watch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
with
that
he
ran
harder
than
ever
down
to
the
water-side
,
in
a
part
*NL*
where
the
river
was
split
in
two
among
three
rocks
.
It
went
through
with
*NL*
a
horrid
thundering
that
made
my
belly
quake
;
and
there
hung
over
the
*NL*
lynn
a
little
mist
of
spray
.
Alan
looked
neither
to
the
right
nor
to
the
*NL*
left
,
but
jumped
clean
upon
the
middle
rock
and
fell
there
on
his
hands
*NL*
and
knees
to
check
himself
,
for
that
rock
was
small
and
he
might
have
*NL*
pitched
over
on
the
far
side
.
I
had
scarce
time
to
measure
the
distance
*NL*
or
to
understand
the
peril
before
I
had
followed
him
,
and
he
had
caught
*NL*
and
stopped
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
there
we
stood
,
side
by
side
upon
a
small
rock
slippery
with
spray
,
*NL*
a
far
broader
leap
in
front
of
us
,
and
the
river
dinning
upon
all
sides
.
*NL*
When
I
saw
where
I
was
,
there
came
on
me
a
deadly
sickness
of
fear
,
*NL*
and
I
put
my
hand
over
my
eyes
.
Alan
took
me
and
shook
me
;
I
saw
he
*NL*
was
speaking
,
but
the
roaring
of
the
falls
and
the
trouble
of
my
mind
*NL*
prevented
me
from
hearing
;
only
I
saw
his
face
was
red
with
anger
,
and
*NL*
that
he
stamped
upon
the
rock
.
The
same
look
showed
me
the
water
raging
*NL*
by
,
and
the
mist
hanging
in
the
air
:
and
with
that
I
covered
my
eyes
*NL*
again
and
shuddered
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
minute
Alan
had
set
the
brandy
bottle
to
my
lips
,
and
forced
*NL*
me
to
drink
about
a
gill
,
which
sent
the
blood
into
my
head
again
.
Then
,
*NL*
putting
his
hands
to
his
mouth
,
and
his
mouth
to
my
ear
,
he
shouted
,
*NL*
``
Hang
or
drown
!
''
and
turning
his
back
upon
me
,
leaped
over
the
farther
*NL*
branch
of
the
stream
,
and
landed
safe
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
now
alone
upon
the
rock
,
which
gave
me
the
more
room
;
the
brandy
*NL*
was
singing
in
my
ears
;
I
had
this
good
example
fresh
before
me
,
and
*NL*
just
wit
enough
to
see
that
if
I
did
not
leap
at
once
,
I
should
never
*NL*
leap
at
all
.
I
bent
low
on
my
knees
and
flung
myself
forth
,
with
*NL*
that
kind
of
anger
of
despair
that
has
sometimes
stood
me
in
stead
of
*NL*
courage
.
Sure
enough
,
it
was
but
my
hands
that
reached
the
full
length
;
*NL*
these
slipped
,
caught
again
,
slipped
again
;
and
I
was
sliddering
back
*NL*
into
the
lynn
,
when
Alan
seized
me
,
first
by
the
hair
,
then
by
the
*NL*
collar
,
and
with
a
great
strain
dragged
me
into
safety
.
*NL*
*NL*
Never
a
word
he
said
,
but
set
off
running
again
for
his
life
,
and
I
must
*NL*
stagger
to
my
feet
and
run
after
him
.
I
had
been
weary
before
,
but
now
*NL*
I
was
sick
and
bruised
,
and
partly
drunken
with
the
brandy
;
I
kept
*NL*
stumbling
as
I
ran
,
I
had
a
stitch
that
came
near
to
overmaster
me
;
and
*NL*
when
at
last
Alan
paused
under
a
great
rock
that
stood
there
among
a
*NL*
number
of
others
,
it
was
none
too
soon
for
David
Balfour
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
great
rock
I
have
said
;
but
by
rights
it
was
two
rocks
leaning
*NL*
together
at
the
top
,
both
some
twenty
feet
high
,
and
at
the
first
sight
*NL*
inaccessible
.
Even
Alan
-LRB-
though
you
may
say
he
had
as
good
as
four
*NL*
hands
-RRB-
failed
twice
in
an
attempt
to
climb
them
;
and
it
was
only
at
the
*NL*
third
trial
,
and
then
by
standing
on
my
shoulders
and
leaping
up
with
*NL*
such
force
as
I
thought
must
have
broken
my
collar-bone
,
that
he
secured
*NL*
a
lodgment
.
Once
there
,
he
let
down
his
leathern
girdle
;
and
with
the
*NL*
aid
of
that
and
a
pair
of
shallow
footholds
in
the
rock
,
I
scrambled
up
*NL*
beside
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
I
saw
why
we
had
come
there
;
for
the
two
rocks
,
being
both
somewhat
*NL*
hollow
on
the
top
and
sloping
one
to
the
other
,
made
a
kind
of
dish
or
*NL*
saucer
,
where
as
many
as
three
or
four
men
might
have
lain
hidden
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
while
Alan
had
not
said
a
word
,
and
had
run
and
climbed
with
*NL*
such
a
savage
,
silent
frenzy
of
hurry
,
that
I
knew
that
he
was
in
mortal
*NL*
fear
of
some
miscarriage
.
Even
now
we
were
on
the
rock
he
said
nothing
,
*NL*
nor
so
much
as
relaxed
the
frowning
look
upon
his
face
;
but
clapped
flat
*NL*
down
,
and
keeping
only
one
eye
above
the
edge
of
our
place
of
shelter
*NL*
scouted
all
round
the
compass
.
The
dawn
had
come
quite
clear
;
we
could
*NL*
see
the
stony
sides
of
the
valley
,
and
its
bottom
,
which
was
bestrewed
*NL*
with
rocks
,
and
the
river
,
which
went
from
one
side
to
another
,
and
made
*NL*
white
falls
;
but
nowhere
the
smoke
of
a
house
,
nor
any
living
creature
*NL*
but
some
eagles
screaming
round
a
cliff
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
at
last
Alan
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
''
said
he
,
``
now
we
have
a
chance
;
''
and
then
looking
at
me
with
some
*NL*
amusement
,
``
Ye
're
no
very
gleg
*
at
the
jumping
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
Brisk
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
I
suppose
I
coloured
with
mortification
,
for
he
added
at
once
,
*NL*
``
Hoots
!
small
blame
to
ye
!
To
be
feared
of
a
thing
and
yet
to
do
it
,
is
*NL*
what
makes
the
prettiest
kind
of
a
man
.
And
then
there
was
water
there
,
*NL*
and
water
's
a
thing
that
dauntons
even
me
.
No
,
no
,
''
said
Alan
,
``
it
's
no
*NL*
you
that
's
to
blame
,
it
's
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
asked
him
why
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
have
proved
myself
a
gomeral
this
night
.
For
first
*NL*
of
all
I
take
a
wrong
road
,
and
that
in
my
own
country
of
Appin
;
so
that
*NL*
the
day
has
caught
us
where
we
should
never
have
been
;
and
thanks
to
*NL*
that
,
we
lie
here
in
some
danger
and
mair
discomfort
.
And
next
-LRB-
which
is
*NL*
the
worst
of
the
two
,
for
a
man
that
has
been
so
much
among
the
heather
*NL*
as
myself
-RRB-
I
have
come
wanting
a
water-bottle
,
and
here
we
lie
for
a
*NL*
long
summer
's
day
with
naething
but
neat
spirit
.
Ye
may
think
that
a
*NL*
small
matter
;
but
before
it
comes
night
,
David
,
ye
'll
give
me
news
of
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
anxious
to
redeem
my
character
,
and
offered
,
if
he
would
pour
out
*NL*
the
brandy
,
to
run
down
and
fill
the
bottle
at
the
river
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wouldnae
waste
the
good
spirit
either
,
''
says
he
.
``
It
's
been
a
good
*NL*
friend
to
you
this
night
;
or
in
my
poor
opinion
,
ye
would
still
be
*NL*
cocking
on
yon
stone
.
And
what
's
mair
,
''
says
he
,
``
ye
may
have
observed
*NL*
-LRB-
you
that
's
a
man
of
so
much
penetration
-RRB-
that
Alan
Breck
Stewart
was
*NL*
perhaps
walking
quicker
than
his
ordinar
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
!
''
I
cried
,
``
you
were
running
fit
to
burst
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
I
so
?
''
said
he
.
``
Well
,
then
,
ye
may
depend
upon
it
,
there
was
nae
*NL*
time
to
be
lost
.
And
now
here
is
enough
said
;
gang
you
to
your
sleep
,
*NL*
lad
,
and
I
'll
watch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Accordingly
,
I
lay
down
to
sleep
;
a
little
peaty
earth
had
drifted
in
*NL*
between
the
top
of
the
two
rocks
,
and
some
bracken
grew
there
,
to
be
a
*NL*
bed
to
me
;
the
last
thing
I
heard
was
still
the
crying
of
the
eagles
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
dare
say
it
would
be
nine
in
the
morning
when
I
was
roughly
awakened
,
*NL*
and
found
Alan
's
hand
pressed
upon
my
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wheesht
!
''
he
whispered
.
``
Ye
were
snoring
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
I
,
surprised
at
his
anxious
and
dark
face
,
``
and
why
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
peered
over
the
edge
of
the
rock
,
and
signed
to
me
to
do
the
like
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
now
high
day
,
cloudless
,
and
very
hot
.
The
valley
was
as
clear
as
*NL*
in
a
picture
.
About
half
a
mile
up
the
water
was
a
camp
of
red-coats
;
a
*NL*
big
fire
blazed
in
their
midst
,
at
which
some
were
cooking
;
and
near
by
,
*NL*
on
the
top
of
a
rock
about
as
high
as
ours
,
there
stood
a
sentry
,
with
*NL*
the
sun
sparkling
on
his
arms
.
All
the
way
down
along
the
river-side
*NL*
were
posted
other
sentries
;
here
near
together
,
there
widelier
*NL*
scattered
;
some
planted
like
the
first
,
on
places
of
command
,
some
*NL*
on
the
ground
level
and
marching
and
counter-marching
,
so
as
to
meet
*NL*
half-way
.
Higher
up
the
glen
,
where
the
ground
was
more
open
,
the
chain
*NL*
of
posts
was
continued
by
horse-soldiers
,
whom
we
could
see
in
the
*NL*
distance
riding
to
and
fro
.
Lower
down
,
the
infantry
continued
;
but
*NL*
as
the
stream
was
suddenly
swelled
by
the
confluence
of
a
considerable
*NL*
burn
,
they
were
more
widely
set
,
and
only
watched
the
fords
and
*NL*
stepping-stones
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
but
one
look
at
them
,
and
ducked
again
into
my
place
.
It
was
*NL*
strange
indeed
to
see
this
valley
,
which
had
lain
so
solitary
in
the
*NL*
hour
of
dawn
,
bristling
with
arms
and
dotted
with
the
red
coats
and
*NL*
breeches
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye
see
,
''
said
Alan
,
``
this
was
what
I
was
afraid
of
,
Davie
:
that
they
*NL*
would
watch
the
burn-side
.
They
began
to
come
in
about
two
hours
ago
,
*NL*
and
,
man
!
but
ye
're
a
grand
hand
at
the
sleeping
!
We
're
in
a
narrow
*NL*
place
.
If
they
get
up
the
sides
of
the
hill
,
they
could
easy
spy
us
with
*NL*
a
glass
;
but
if
they
'll
only
keep
in
the
foot
of
the
valley
,
we
'll
do
*NL*
yet
.
The
posts
are
thinner
down
the
water
;
and
,
come
night
,
we
'll
try
*NL*
our
hand
at
getting
by
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
are
we
to
do
till
night
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lie
here
,
''
says
he
,
``
and
birstle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
one
good
Scotch
word
,
``
birstle
,
''
was
indeed
the
most
of
the
story
*NL*
of
the
day
that
we
had
now
to
pass
.
You
are
to
remember
that
we
lay
on
*NL*
the
bare
top
of
a
rock
,
like
scones
upon
a
girdle
;
the
sun
beat
upon
us
*NL*
cruelly
;
the
rock
grew
so
heated
,
a
man
could
scarce
endure
the
touch
of
*NL*
it
;
and
the
little
patch
of
earth
and
fern
,
which
kept
cooler
,
was
only
*NL*
large
enough
for
one
at
a
time
.
We
took
turn
about
to
lie
on
the
naked
*NL*
rock
,
which
was
indeed
like
the
position
of
that
saint
that
was
martyred
*NL*
on
a
gridiron
;
and
it
ran
in
my
mind
how
strange
it
was
,
that
in
the
*NL*
same
climate
and
at
only
a
few
days
'
distance
,
I
should
have
suffered
*NL*
so
cruelly
,
first
from
cold
upon
my
island
and
now
from
heat
upon
this
*NL*
rock
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
while
we
had
no
water
,
only
raw
brandy
for
a
drink
,
which
was
*NL*
worse
than
nothing
;
but
we
kept
the
bottle
as
cool
as
we
could
,
burying
*NL*
it
in
the
earth
,
and
got
some
relief
by
bathing
our
breasts
and
temples
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
soldiers
kept
stirring
all
day
in
the
bottom
of
the
valley
,
now
*NL*
changing
guard
,
now
in
patrolling
parties
hunting
among
the
rocks
.
These
*NL*
lay
round
in
so
great
a
number
,
that
to
look
for
men
among
them
was
like
*NL*
looking
for
a
needle
in
a
bottle
of
hay
;
and
being
so
hopeless
a
task
,
*NL*
it
was
gone
about
with
the
less
care
.
Yet
we
could
see
the
soldiers
*NL*
pike
their
bayonets
among
the
heather
,
which
sent
a
cold
thrill
into
my
*NL*
vitals
;
and
they
would
sometimes
hang
about
our
rock
,
so
that
we
scarce
*NL*
dared
to
breathe
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
this
way
that
I
first
heard
the
right
English
speech
;
one
*NL*
fellow
as
he
went
by
actually
clapping
his
hand
upon
the
sunny
face
of
*NL*
the
rock
on
which
we
lay
,
and
plucking
it
off
again
with
an
oath
.
``
I
*NL*
tell
you
it
's
`
ot
,
''
says
he
;
and
I
was
amazed
at
the
clipping
tones
and
*NL*
the
odd
sing-song
in
which
he
spoke
,
and
no
less
at
that
strange
trick
*NL*
of
dropping
out
the
letter
``
h.
''
To
be
sure
,
I
had
heard
Ransome
;
but
he
*NL*
had
taken
his
ways
from
all
sorts
of
people
,
and
spoke
so
imperfectly
*NL*
at
the
best
,
that
I
set
down
the
most
of
it
to
childishness
.
My
surprise
*NL*
was
all
the
greater
to
hear
that
manner
of
speaking
in
the
mouth
of
a
*NL*
grown
man
;
and
indeed
I
have
never
grown
used
to
it
;
nor
yet
altogether
*NL*
with
the
English
grammar
,
as
perhaps
a
very
critical
eye
might
here
and
*NL*
there
spy
out
even
in
these
memoirs
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tediousness
and
pain
of
these
hours
upon
the
rock
grew
only
the
*NL*
greater
as
the
day
went
on
;
the
rock
getting
still
the
hotter
and
the
*NL*
sun
fiercer
.
There
were
giddiness
,
and
sickness
,
and
sharp
pangs
like
*NL*
rheumatism
,
to
be
supported
.
I
minded
then
,
and
have
often
minded
since
,
*NL*
on
the
lines
in
our
Scotch
psalm
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
moon
by
night
thee
shall
not
smite
,
*NL*
Nor
yet
the
sun
by
day
;
''
*NL*
*NL*
and
indeed
it
was
only
by
God
's
blessing
that
we
were
neither
of
us
*NL*
sun-smitten
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
about
two
,
it
was
beyond
men
's
bearing
,
and
there
was
now
*NL*
temptation
to
resist
,
as
well
as
pain
to
thole
.
For
the
sun
being
now
*NL*
got
a
little
into
the
west
,
there
came
a
patch
of
shade
on
the
east
side
*NL*
of
our
rock
,
which
was
the
side
sheltered
from
the
soldiers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
well
one
death
as
another
,
''
said
Alan
,
and
slipped
over
the
edge
and
*NL*
dropped
on
the
ground
on
the
shadowy
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
followed
him
at
once
,
and
instantly
fell
all
my
length
,
so
weak
was
I
*NL*
and
so
giddy
with
that
long
exposure
.
Here
,
then
,
we
lay
for
an
hour
or
*NL*
two
,
aching
from
head
to
foot
,
as
weak
as
water
,
and
lying
quite
naked
*NL*
to
the
eye
of
any
soldier
who
should
have
strolled
that
way
.
None
came
,
*NL*
however
,
all
passing
by
on
the
other
side
;
so
that
our
rock
continued
to
*NL*
be
our
shield
even
in
this
new
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
we
began
again
to
get
a
little
strength
;
and
as
the
soldiers
*NL*
were
now
lying
closer
along
the
river-side
,
Alan
proposed
that
we
should
*NL*
try
a
start
.
I
was
by
this
time
afraid
of
but
one
thing
in
the
world
;
*NL*
and
that
was
to
be
set
back
upon
the
rock
;
anything
else
was
welcome
*NL*
to
me
;
so
we
got
ourselves
at
once
in
marching
order
,
and
began
to
slip
*NL*
from
rock
to
rock
one
after
the
other
,
now
crawling
flat
on
our
bellies
*NL*
in
the
shade
,
now
making
a
run
for
it
,
heart
in
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
soldiers
,
having
searched
this
side
of
the
valley
after
a
fashion
,
*NL*
and
being
perhaps
somewhat
sleepy
with
the
sultriness
of
the
afternoon
,
*NL*
had
now
laid
by
much
of
their
vigilance
,
and
stood
dozing
at
their
posts
*NL*
or
only
kept
a
look-out
along
the
banks
of
the
river
;
so
that
in
this
*NL*
way
,
keeping
down
the
valley
and
at
the
same
time
towards
the
mountains
,
*NL*
we
drew
steadily
away
from
their
neighbourhood
.
But
the
business
was
the
*NL*
most
wearing
I
had
ever
taken
part
in
.
A
man
had
need
of
a
hundred
*NL*
eyes
in
every
part
of
him
,
to
keep
concealed
in
that
uneven
country
and
*NL*
within
cry
of
so
many
and
scattered
sentries
.
When
we
must
pass
an
open
*NL*
place
,
quickness
was
not
all
,
but
a
swift
judgment
not
only
of
the
lie
*NL*
of
the
whole
country
,
but
of
the
solidity
of
every
stone
on
which
we
*NL*
must
set
foot
;
for
the
afternoon
was
now
fallen
so
breathless
that
the
*NL*
rolling
of
a
pebble
sounded
abroad
like
a
pistol
shot
,
and
would
start
*NL*
the
echo
calling
among
the
hills
and
cliffs
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
sundown
we
had
made
some
distance
,
even
by
our
slow
rate
of
progress
,
*NL*
though
to
be
sure
the
sentry
on
the
rock
was
still
plainly
in
our
view
.
*NL*
But
now
we
came
on
something
that
put
all
fears
out
of
season
;
and
that
*NL*
was
a
deep
rushing
burn
,
that
tore
down
,
in
that
part
,
to
join
the
glen
*NL*
river
.
At
the
sight
of
this
we
cast
ourselves
on
the
ground
and
plunged
*NL*
head
and
shoulders
in
the
water
;
and
I
can
not
tell
which
was
the
more
*NL*
pleasant
,
the
great
shock
as
the
cool
stream
went
over
us
,
or
the
greed
*NL*
with
which
we
drank
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
lay
there
-LRB-
for
the
banks
hid
us
-RRB-
,
drank
again
and
again
,
bathed
our
*NL*
chests
,
let
our
wrists
trail
in
the
running
water
till
they
ached
*NL*
with
the
chill
;
and
at
last
,
being
wonderfully
renewed
,
we
got
out
the
*NL*
meal-bag
and
made
drammach
in
the
iron
pan
.
This
,
though
it
is
but
cold
*NL*
water
mingled
with
oatmeal
,
yet
makes
a
good
enough
dish
for
a
hungry
*NL*
man
;
and
where
there
are
no
means
of
making
fire
,
or
-LRB-
as
in
our
case
-RRB-
*NL*
good
reason
for
not
making
one
,
it
is
the
chief
stand-by
of
those
who
*NL*
have
taken
to
the
heather
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
the
shadow
of
the
night
had
fallen
,
we
set
forth
again
,
at
*NL*
first
with
the
same
caution
,
but
presently
with
more
boldness
,
standing
*NL*
our
full
height
and
stepping
out
at
a
good
pace
of
walking
.
The
way
*NL*
was
very
intricate
,
lying
up
the
steep
sides
of
mountains
and
along
the
*NL*
brows
of
cliffs
;
clouds
had
come
in
with
the
sunset
,
and
the
night
was
*NL*
dark
and
cool
;
so
that
I
walked
without
much
fatigue
,
but
in
continual
*NL*
fear
of
falling
and
rolling
down
the
mountains
,
and
with
no
guess
at
our
*NL*
direction
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
moon
rose
at
last
and
found
us
still
on
the
road
;
it
was
in
its
last
*NL*
quarter
,
and
was
long
beset
with
clouds
;
but
after
awhile
shone
out
and
*NL*
showed
me
many
dark
heads
of
mountains
,
and
was
reflected
far
underneath
*NL*
us
on
the
narrow
arm
of
a
sea-loch
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
sight
we
both
paused
:
I
struck
with
wonder
to
find
myself
so
*NL*
high
and
walking
-LRB-
as
it
seemed
to
me
-RRB-
upon
clouds
;
Alan
to
make
sure
of
*NL*
his
direction
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seemingly
he
was
well
pleased
,
and
he
must
certainly
have
judged
us
*NL*
out
of
ear-shot
of
all
our
enemies
;
for
throughout
the
rest
of
our
*NL*
night-march
he
beguiled
the
way
with
whistling
of
many
tunes
,
warlike
,
*NL*
merry
,
plaintive
;
reel
tunes
that
made
the
foot
go
faster
;
tunes
of
my
*NL*
own
south
country
that
made
me
fain
to
be
home
from
my
adventures
;
and
*NL*
all
these
,
on
the
great
,
dark
,
desert
mountains
,
making
company
upon
the
*NL*
way
.

CHAPTER
XXI
*NL*
*NL*
THE
FLIGHT
IN
THE
HEATHER
:
THE
HEUGH
OF
CORRYNAKIEGH
*NL*
*NL*
Early
as
day
comes
in
the
beginning
of
July
,
it
was
still
dark
when
we
*NL*
reached
our
destination
,
a
cleft
in
the
head
of
a
great
mountain
,
with
a
*NL*
water
running
through
the
midst
,
and
upon
the
one
hand
a
shallow
cave
*NL*
in
a
rock
.
Birches
grew
there
in
a
thin
,
pretty
wood
,
which
a
little
*NL*
farther
on
was
changed
into
a
wood
of
pines
.
The
burn
was
full
of
trout
;
*NL*
the
wood
of
cushat-doves
;
on
the
open
side
of
the
mountain
beyond
,
*NL*
whaups
would
be
always
whistling
,
and
cuckoos
were
plentiful
.
From
the
*NL*
mouth
of
the
cleft
we
looked
down
upon
a
part
of
Mamore
,
and
on
the
*NL*
sea-loch
that
divides
that
country
from
Appin
;
and
this
from
so
great
*NL*
a
height
as
made
it
my
continual
wonder
and
pleasure
to
sit
and
behold
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
name
of
the
cleft
was
the
Heugh
of
Corrynakiegh
;
and
although
from
*NL*
its
height
and
being
so
near
upon
the
sea
,
it
was
often
beset
with
*NL*
clouds
,
yet
it
was
on
the
whole
a
pleasant
place
,
and
the
five
days
we
*NL*
lived
in
it
went
happily
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
slept
in
the
cave
,
making
our
bed
of
heather
bushes
which
we
cut
for
*NL*
that
purpose
,
and
covering
ourselves
with
Alan
's
great-coat
.
There
was
a
*NL*
low
concealed
place
,
in
a
turning
of
the
glen
,
where
we
were
so
bold
as
*NL*
to
make
fire
:
so
that
we
could
warm
ourselves
when
the
clouds
set
in
,
*NL*
and
cook
hot
porridge
,
and
grill
the
little
trouts
that
we
caught
with
*NL*
our
hands
under
the
stones
and
overhanging
banks
of
the
burn
.
This
was
*NL*
indeed
our
chief
pleasure
and
business
;
and
not
only
to
save
our
meal
*NL*
against
worse
times
,
but
with
a
rivalry
that
much
amused
us
,
we
spent
*NL*
a
great
part
of
our
days
at
the
water-side
,
stripped
to
the
waist
and
*NL*
groping
about
or
-LRB-
as
they
say
-RRB-
guddling
for
these
fish
.
The
largest
we
*NL*
got
might
have
been
a
quarter
of
a
pound
;
but
they
were
of
good
flesh
*NL*
and
flavour
,
and
when
broiled
upon
the
coals
,
lacked
only
a
little
salt
*NL*
to
be
delicious
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
any
by-time
Alan
must
teach
me
to
use
my
sword
,
for
my
ignorance
*NL*
had
much
distressed
him
;
and
I
think
besides
,
as
I
had
sometimes
*NL*
the
upper-hand
of
him
in
the
fishing
,
he
was
not
sorry
to
turn
to
an
*NL*
exercise
where
he
had
so
much
the
upper-hand
of
me
.
He
made
it
somewhat
*NL*
more
of
a
pain
than
need
have
been
,
for
he
stormed
at
me
all
through
the
*NL*
lessons
in
a
very
violent
manner
of
scolding
,
and
would
push
me
so
close
*NL*
that
I
made
sure
he
must
run
me
through
the
body
.
I
was
often
tempted
*NL*
to
turn
tail
,
but
held
my
ground
for
all
that
,
and
got
some
profit
of
*NL*
my
lessons
;
if
it
was
but
to
stand
on
guard
with
an
assured
countenance
,
*NL*
which
is
often
all
that
is
required
.
So
,
though
I
could
never
in
the
*NL*
least
please
my
master
,
I
was
not
altogether
displeased
with
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meanwhile
,
you
are
not
to
suppose
that
we
neglected
our
chief
*NL*
business
,
which
was
to
get
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
be
many
a
long
day
,
''
Alan
said
to
me
on
our
first
morning
,
*NL*
``
before
the
red-coats
think
upon
seeking
Corrynakiegh
;
so
now
we
must
*NL*
get
word
sent
to
James
,
and
he
must
find
the
siller
for
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
shall
we
send
that
word
?
''
says
I.
``
We
are
here
in
a
desert
*NL*
place
,
which
yet
we
dare
not
leave
;
and
unless
ye
get
the
fowls
of
the
*NL*
air
to
be
your
messengers
,
I
see
not
what
we
shall
be
able
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
?
''
said
Alan
.
``
Ye
're
a
man
of
small
contrivance
,
David
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thereupon
he
fell
in
a
muse
,
looking
in
the
embers
of
the
fire
;
and
*NL*
presently
,
getting
a
piece
of
wood
,
he
fashioned
it
in
a
cross
,
the
four
*NL*
ends
of
which
he
blackened
on
the
coals
.
Then
he
looked
at
me
a
little
*NL*
shyly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Could
ye
lend
me
my
button
?
''
says
he
.
``
It
seems
a
strange
thing
to
ask
*NL*
a
gift
again
,
but
I
own
I
am
laith
to
cut
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
gave
him
the
button
;
whereupon
he
strung
it
on
a
strip
of
his
*NL*
great-coat
which
he
had
used
to
bind
the
cross
;
and
tying
in
a
little
*NL*
sprig
of
birch
and
another
of
fir
,
he
looked
upon
his
work
with
*NL*
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
he
,
``
there
is
a
little
clachan
''
-LRB-
what
is
called
a
hamlet
*NL*
in
the
English
-RRB-
``
not
very
far
from
Corrynakiegh
,
and
it
has
the
name
of
*NL*
Koalisnacoan
.
There
there
are
living
many
friends
of
mine
whom
I
could
*NL*
trust
with
my
life
,
and
some
that
I
am
no
just
so
sure
of
.
Ye
see
,
*NL*
David
,
there
will
be
money
set
upon
our
heads
;
James
himsel
'
is
to
set
*NL*
money
on
them
;
and
as
for
the
Campbells
,
they
would
never
spare
siller
*NL*
where
there
was
a
Stewart
to
be
hurt
.
If
it
was
otherwise
,
I
would
go
*NL*
down
to
Koalisnacoan
whatever
,
and
trust
my
life
into
these
people
's
*NL*
hands
as
lightly
as
I
would
trust
another
with
my
glove
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
being
so

''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Being
so

said
he
,
``
I
would

lief

didnae
see
me

There
's
bad
*NL*
folk
everywhere
,
and
what
's
far
worse
,
weak
ones
.
So
when
it
comes
dark
*NL*
again
,
I
will
steal
down
into
that
clachan
,
and
set
this
that
I
have
*NL*
been
making
in
the
window
of
a
good
friend

A
bouman

*NL*
*NL*
``
With

says
I
;
``

if

what

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

says
Alan

But
this
is
what
*NL*
I
have
in
my
mind
.
This
cross
is
something
in
the
nature
of
the
*NL*
crosstarrie
,
or
fiery
cross
,
which
is
the
signal
of
gathering
in
our
*NL*
clans
;
yet
he
will
know
well
enough
the
clan
is
not
to
rise
,
for
there
*NL*
it
is
standing
in
his
window
,
and
no
word
with
it
.
So
he
will
say
to
*NL*
himsel
'
,
THE
CLAN
IS
NOT
TO
RISE
,
BUT
THERE
IS
SOMETHING
.
Then
he
will
*NL*
see
my
button
,
and
that
was
Duncan
Stewart
's
.
And
then
he
will
say
to
*NL*
himsel
'
,
THE
SON
OF
DUNCAN
IS
IN
THE
HEATHER
,
AND
HAS
NEED
OF
ME
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
I
,
``
it
may
be
.
But
even
supposing
so
,
there
is
a
good
deal
*NL*
of
heather
between
here
and
the
Forth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
is
a
very
true
word
,
''
says
Alan
.
``
But
then
John
Breck
will
see
*NL*
the
sprig
of
birch
and
the
sprig
of
pine
;
and
he
will
say
to
himsel
'
-LRB-
if
*NL*
he
is
a
man
of
any
penetration
at
all
,
which
I
misdoubt
-RRB-
,
ALAN
WILL
BE
*NL*
LYING
IN
A
WOOD
WHICH
IS
BOTH
OF
PINES
AND
BIRCHES
.
Then
he
will
think
*NL*
to
himsel
'
,
THAT
IS
NOT
SO
VERY
RIFE
HEREABOUT
;
and
then
he
will
come
*NL*
and
give
us
a
look
up
in
Corrynakiegh
.
And
if
he
does
not
,
David
,
the
*NL*
devil
may
fly
away
with
him
,
for
what
I
care
;
for
he
will
no
be
worth
*NL*
the
salt
to
his
porridge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
man
,
''
said
I
,
drolling
with
him
a
little
,
``
you
're
very
ingenious
!
*NL*
But
would
it
not
be
simpler
for
you
to
write
him
a
few
words
in
black
*NL*
and
white
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
is
an
excellent
observe
,
Mr.
Balfour
of
Shaws
,
''
says
Alan
,
*NL*
drolling
with
me
;
``
and
it
would
certainly
be
much
simpler
for
me
to
*NL*
write
to
him
,
but
it
would
be
a
sore
job
for
John
Breck
to
read
it
.
He
*NL*
would
have
to
go
to
the
school
for
two-three
years
;
and
it
's
possible
we
*NL*
might
be
wearied
waiting
on
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
that
night
Alan
carried
down
his
fiery
cross
and
set
it
in
the
*NL*
bouman
's
window
.
He
was
troubled
when
he
came
back
;
for
the
dogs
had
*NL*
barked
and
the
folk
run
out
from
their
houses
;
and
he
thought
he
had
*NL*
heard
a
clatter
of
arms
and
seen
a
red-coat
come
to
one
of
the
doors
.
On
*NL*
all
accounts
we
lay
the
next
day
in
the
borders
of
the
wood
and
kept
a
*NL*
close
look-out
,
so
that
if
it
was
John
Breck
that
came
we
might
be
ready
*NL*
to
guide
him
,
and
if
it
was
the
red-coats
we
should
have
time
to
get
*NL*
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
noon
a
man
was
to
be
spied
,
straggling
up
the
open
side
of
the
*NL*
mountain
in
the
sun
,
and
looking
round
him
as
he
came
,
from
under
his
*NL*
hand
.
No
sooner
had
Alan
seen
him
than
he
whistled
;
the
man
turned
and
*NL*
came
a
little
towards
us
:
then
Alan
would
give
another
``
peep
!
''
and
the
*NL*
man
would
come
still
nearer
;
and
so
by
the
sound
of
whistling
,
he
was
*NL*
guided
to
the
spot
where
we
lay
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
ragged
,
wild
,
bearded
man
,
about
forty
,
grossly
disfigured
with
*NL*
the
small
pox
,
and
looked
both
dull
and
savage
.
Although
his
English
*NL*
was
very
bad
and
broken
,
yet
Alan
-LRB-
according
to
his
very
handsome
use
,
*NL*
whenever
I
was
by
-RRB-
would
suffer
him
to
speak
no
Gaelic
.
Perhaps
the
*NL*
strange
language
made
him
appear
more
backward
than
he
really
was
;
but
*NL*
I
thought
he
had
little
good-will
to
serve
us
,
and
what
he
had
was
the
*NL*
child
of
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alan
would
have
had
him
carry
a
message
to
James
;
but
the
bouman
would
*NL*
hear
of
no
message
.
``
She
was
forget
it
,
''
he
said
in
his
screaming
voice
;
*NL*
and
would
either
have
a
letter
or
wash
his
hands
of
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
Alan
would
be
gravelled
at
that
,
for
we
lacked
the
means
of
*NL*
writing
in
that
desert
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
was
a
man
of
more
resources
than
I
knew
;
searched
the
wood
until
*NL*
he
found
the
quill
of
a
cushat-dove
,
which
he
shaped
into
a
pen
;
made
*NL*
himself
a
kind
of
ink
with
gunpowder
from
his
horn
and
water
from
the
*NL*
running
stream
;
and
tearing
a
corner
from
his
French
military
commission
*NL*
-LRB-
which
he
carried
in
his
pocket
,
like
a
talisman
to
keep
him
from
the
*NL*
gallows
-RRB-
,
he
sat
down
and
wrote
as
follows
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
DEAR
KINSMAN
,
--
Please
send
the
money
by
the
bearer
to
the
place
he
kens
*NL*
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
affectionate
cousin
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
A.
S.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
This
he
intrusted
to
the
bouman
,
who
promised
to
make
what
manner
of
*NL*
speed
he
best
could
,
and
carried
it
off
with
him
down
the
hill
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
three
full
days
gone
,
but
about
five
in
the
evening
of
the
third
,
*NL*
we
heard
a
whistling
in
the
wood
,
which
Alan
answered
;
and
presently
the
*NL*
bouman
came
up
the
water-side
,
looking
for
us
,
right
and
left
.
He
seemed
*NL*
less
sulky
than
before
,
and
indeed
he
was
no
doubt
well
pleased
to
have
*NL*
got
to
the
end
of
such
a
dangerous
commission
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
gave
us
the
news
of
the
country
;
that
it
was
alive
with
red-coats
;
*NL*
that
arms
were
being
found
,
and
poor
folk
brought
in
trouble
daily
;
and
*NL*
that
James
and
some
of
his
servants
were
already
clapped
in
prison
at
*NL*
Fort
William
,
under
strong
suspicion
of
complicity
.
It
seemed
it
was
*NL*
noised
on
all
sides
that
Alan
Breck
had
fired
the
shot
;
and
there
was
a
*NL*
bill
issued
for
both
him
and
me
,
with
one
hundred
pounds
reward
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
all
as
bad
as
could
be
;
and
the
little
note
the
bouman
had
*NL*
carried
us
from
Mrs.
Stewart
was
of
a
miserable
sadness
.
In
it
she
*NL*
besought
Alan
not
to
let
himself
be
captured
,
assuring
him
,
if
he
fell
*NL*
in
the
hands
of
the
troops
,
both
he
and
James
were
no
better
than
dead
*NL*
men
.
The
money
she
had
sent
was
all
that
she
could
beg
or
borrow
,
and
*NL*
she
prayed
heaven
we
could
be
doing
with
it
.
Lastly
,
she
said
,
she
*NL*
enclosed
us
one
of
the
bills
in
which
we
were
described
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
we
looked
upon
with
great
curiosity
and
not
a
little
fear
,
partly
*NL*
as
a
man
may
look
in
a
mirror
,
partly
as
he
might
look
into
the
barrel
*NL*
of
an
enemy
's
gun
to
judge
if
it
be
truly
aimed
.
Alan
was
advertised
as
*NL*
``
a
small
,
pock-marked
,
active
man
of
thirty-five
or
thereby
,
dressed
*NL*
in
a
feathered
hat
,
a
French
side-coat
of
blue
with
silver
buttons
,
*NL*
and
lace
a
great
deal
tarnished
,
a
red
waistcoat
and
breeches
of
black
,
*NL*
shag
;
''
and
I
as
``
a
tall
strong
lad
of
about
eighteen
,
wearing
an
*NL*
old
blue
coat
,
very
ragged
,
an
old
Highland
bonnet
,
a
long
homespun
*NL*
waistcoat
,
blue
breeches
;
his
legs
bare
,
low-country
shoes
,
wanting
the
*NL*
toes
;
speaks
like
a
Lowlander
,
and
has
no
beard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alan
was
well
enough
pleased
to
see
his
finery
so
fully
remembered
and
*NL*
set
down
;
only
when
he
came
to
the
word
tarnish
,
he
looked
upon
his
lace
*NL*
like
one
a
little
mortified
.
As
for
myself
,
I
thought
I
cut
a
miserable
*NL*
figure
in
the
bill
;
and
yet
was
well
enough
pleased
too
,
for
since
I
had
*NL*
changed
these
rags
,
the
description
had
ceased
to
be
a
danger
and
become
*NL*
a
source
of
safety
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alan
,
''
said
I
,
``
you
should
change
your
clothes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Na
,
troth
!
''
said
Alan
,
``
I
have
nae
others
.
A
fine
sight
I
would
be
,
if
*NL*
I
went
back
to
France
in
a
bonnet
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
put
a
second
reflection
in
my
mind
:
that
if
I
were
to
separate
*NL*
from
Alan
and
his
tell-tale
clothes
I
should
be
safe
against
arrest
,
and
*NL*
might
go
openly
about
my
business
.
Nor
was
this
all
;
for
suppose
I
was
*NL*
arrested
when
I
was
alone
,
there
was
little
against
me
;
but
suppose
I
*NL*
was
taken
in
company
with
the
reputed
murderer
,
my
case
would
begin
to
*NL*
be
grave
.
For
generosity
's
sake
I
dare
not
speak
my
mind
upon
this
head
;
*NL*
but
I
thought
of
it
none
the
less
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
of
it
all
the
more
,
too
,
when
the
bouman
brought
out
a
green
*NL*
purse
with
four
guineas
in
gold
,
and
the
best
part
of
another
in
small
*NL*
change
.
True
,
it
was
more
than
I
had
.
But
then
Alan
,
with
less
than
*NL*
five
guineas
,
had
to
get
as
far
as
France
;
I
,
with
my
less
than
two
,
not
*NL*
beyond
Queensferry
;
so
that
taking
things
in
their
proportion
,
Alan
's
*NL*
society
was
not
only
a
peril
to
my
life
,
but
a
burden
on
my
purse
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
was
no
thought
of
the
sort
in
the
honest
head
of
my
companion
.
*NL*
He
believed
he
was
serving
,
helping
,
and
protecting
me
.
And
what
could
I
*NL*
do
but
hold
my
peace
,
and
chafe
,
and
take
my
chance
of
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
little
enough
,
''
said
Alan
,
putting
the
purse
in
his
pocket
,
``
but
*NL*
it
'll
do
my
business
.
And
now
,
John
Breck
,
if
ye
will
hand
me
over
my
*NL*
button
,
this
gentleman
and
me
will
be
for
taking
the
road
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
bouman
,
after
feeling
about
in
a
hairy
purse
that
hung
in
front
*NL*
of
him
in
the
Highland
manner
-LRB-
though
he
wore
otherwise
the
Lowland
*NL*
habit
,
with
sea-trousers
-RRB-
,
began
to
roll
his
eyes
strangely
,
and
at
last
*NL*
said
,
``
Her
nainsel
will
loss
it
,
''
meaning
he
thought
he
had
lost
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
cried
Alan
,
``
you
will
lose
my
button
,
that
was
my
father
's
*NL*
before
me
?
Now
I
will
tell
you
what
is
in
my
mind
,
John
Breck
:
it
is
*NL*
in
my
mind
this
is
the
worst
day
's
work
that
ever
ye
did
since
ye
was
*NL*
born
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
as
Alan
spoke
,
he
set
his
hands
on
his
knees
and
looked
at
the
*NL*
bouman
with
a
smiling
mouth
,
and
that
dancing
light
in
his
eyes
that
*NL*
meant
mischief
to
his
enemies
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
the
bouman
was
honest
enough
;
perhaps
he
had
meant
to
cheat
and
*NL*
then
,
finding
himself
alone
with
two
of
us
in
a
desert
place
,
cast
back
*NL*
to
honesty
as
being
safer
;
at
least
,
and
all
at
once
,
he
seemed
to
find
*NL*
that
button
and
handed
it
to
Alan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
it
is
a
good
thing
for
the
honour
of
the
Maccolls
,
''
said
*NL*
Alan
,
and
then
to
me
,
``
Here
is
my
button
back
again
,
and
I
thank
you
for
*NL*
parting
with
it
,
which
is
of
a
piece
with
all
your
friendships
to
me
.
''
*NL*
Then
he
took
the
warmest
parting
of
the
bouman
.
``
For
,
''
says
he
,
``
ye
have
*NL*
done
very
well
by
me
,
and
set
your
neck
at
a
venture
,
and
I
will
always
*NL*
give
you
the
name
of
a
good
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lastly
,
the
bouman
took
himself
off
by
one
way
;
and
Alan
and
I
-LRB-
getting
our
*NL*
chattels
together
-RRB-
struck
into
another
to
resume
our
flight
.

CHAPTER
XXII
*NL*
*NL*
THE
FLIGHT
IN
THE
HEATHER
:
THE
MOOR
*NL*
*NL*
Some
seven
hours
'
incessant
,
hard
travelling
brought
us
early
in
the
*NL*
morning
to
the
end
of
a
range
of
mountains
.
In
front
of
us
there
lay
a
*NL*
piece
of
low
,
broken
,
desert
land
,
which
we
must
now
cross
.
The
sun
was
*NL*
not
long
up
,
and
shone
straight
in
our
eyes
;
a
little
,
thin
mist
went
up
*NL*
from
the
face
of
the
moorland
like
a
smoke
;
so
that
-LRB-
as
Alan
said
-RRB-
there
*NL*
might
have
been
twenty
squadron
of
dragoons
there
and
we
none
the
wiser
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
sat
down
,
therefore
,
in
a
howe
of
the
hill-side
till
the
mist
should
*NL*
have
risen
,
and
made
ourselves
a
dish
of
drammach
,
and
held
a
council
of
*NL*
war
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
David
,
''
said
Alan
,
``
this
is
the
kittle
bit
.
Shall
we
lie
here
till
it
*NL*
comes
night
,
or
shall
we
risk
it
,
and
stave
on
ahead
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
I
,
``
I
am
tired
indeed
,
but
I
could
walk
as
far
again
,
if
*NL*
that
was
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
but
it
isnae
,
''
said
Alan
,
``
nor
yet
the
half
.
This
is
how
we
stand
:
*NL*
Appin
's
fair
death
to
us
.
To
the
south
it
's
all
Campbells
,
and
no
to
be
*NL*
thought
of
.
To
the
north
;
well
,
there
's
no
muckle
to
be
gained
by
going
*NL*
north
;
neither
for
you
,
that
wants
to
get
to
Queensferry
,
nor
yet
for
*NL*
me
,
that
wants
to
get
to
France
.
Well
,
then
,
we
'll
can
strike
east
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
East
be
it
!
''
says
I
,
quite
cheerily
;
but
I
was
thinking
in
to
myself
:
*NL*
``
O
,
man
,
if
you
would
only
take
one
point
of
the
compass
and
let
me
take
*NL*
any
other
,
it
would
be
the
best
for
both
of
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
east
,
ye
see
,
we
have
the
muirs
,
''
said
Alan
.
``
Once
there
,
*NL*
David
,
it
's
mere
pitch-and-toss
.
Out
on
yon
bald
,
naked
,
flat
place
,
*NL*
where
can
a
body
turn
to
?
Let
the
red-coats
come
over
a
hill
,
they
can
*NL*
spy
you
miles
away
;
and
the
sorrow
's
in
their
horses
'
heels
,
they
would
*NL*
soon
ride
you
down
.
It
's
no
good
place
,
David
;
and
I
'm
free
to
say
,
it
's
*NL*
worse
by
daylight
than
by
dark
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alan
,
''
said
I
,
``
hear
my
way
of
it
.
Appin
's
death
for
us
;
we
have
none
*NL*
too
much
money
,
nor
yet
meal
;
the
longer
they
seek
,
the
nearer
they
*NL*
may
guess
where
we
are
;
it
's
all
a
risk
;
and
I
give
my
word
to
go
ahead
*NL*
until
we
drop
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alan
was
delighted
.
``
There
are
whiles
,
''
said
he
,
``
when
ye
are
altogether
*NL*
too
canny
and
Whiggish
to
be
company
for
a
gentleman
like
me
;
but
there
*NL*
come
other
whiles
when
ye
show
yoursel
'
a
mettle
spark
;
and
it
's
then
,
*NL*
David
,
that
I
love
ye
like
a
brother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
mist
rose
and
died
away
,
and
showed
us
that
country
lying
as
waste
*NL*
as
the
sea
;
only
the
moorfowl
and
the
pewees
crying
upon
it
,
and
far
*NL*
over
to
the
east
,
a
herd
of
deer
,
moving
like
dots
.
Much
of
it
was
red
*NL*
with
heather
;
much
of
the
rest
broken
up
with
bogs
and
hags
and
peaty
*NL*
pools
;
some
had
been
burnt
black
in
a
heath
fire
;
and
in
another
place
*NL*
there
was
quite
a
forest
of
dead
firs
,
standing
like
skeletons
.
A
*NL*
wearier-looking
desert
man
never
saw
;
but
at
least
it
was
clear
of
*NL*
troops
,
which
was
our
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
went
down
accordingly
into
the
waste
,
and
began
to
make
our
toilsome
*NL*
and
devious
travel
towards
the
eastern
verge
.
There
were
the
tops
of
*NL*
mountains
all
round
-LRB-
you
are
to
remember
-RRB-
from
whence
we
might
be
spied
*NL*
at
any
moment
;
so
it
behoved
us
to
keep
in
the
hollow
parts
of
the
moor
,
*NL*
and
when
these
turned
aside
from
our
direction
to
move
upon
its
naked
*NL*
face
with
infinite
care
.
Sometimes
,
for
half
an
hour
together
,
we
must
*NL*
crawl
from
one
heather
bush
to
another
,
as
hunters
do
when
they
are
hard
*NL*
upon
the
deer
.
It
was
a
clear
day
again
,
with
a
blazing
sun
;
the
water
*NL*
in
the
brandy
bottle
was
soon
gone
;
and
altogether
,
if
I
had
guessed
*NL*
what
it
would
be
to
crawl
half
the
time
upon
my
belly
and
to
walk
much
*NL*
of
the
rest
stooping
nearly
to
the
knees
,
I
should
certainly
have
held
*NL*
back
from
such
a
killing
enterprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
Toiling
and
resting
and
toiling
again
,
we
wore
away
the
morning
;
and
*NL*
about
noon
lay
down
in
a
thick
bush
of
heather
to
sleep
.
Alan
took
the
*NL*
first
watch
;
and
it
seemed
to
me
I
had
scarce
closed
my
eyes
before
I
*NL*
was
shaken
up
to
take
the
second
.
We
had
no
clock
to
go
by
;
and
Alan
*NL*
stuck
a
sprig
of
heath
in
the
ground
to
serve
instead
;
so
that
as
soon
*NL*
as
the
shadow
of
the
bush
should
fall
so
far
to
the
east
,
I
might
know
*NL*
to
rouse
him
.
But
I
was
by
this
time
so
weary
that
I
could
have
slept
*NL*
twelve
hours
at
a
stretch
;
I
had
the
taste
of
sleep
in
my
throat
;
my
*NL*
joints
slept
even
when
my
mind
was
waking
;
the
hot
smell
of
the
heather
,
*NL*
and
the
drone
of
the
wild
bees
,
were
like
possets
to
me
;
and
every
now
*NL*
and
again
I
would
give
a
jump
and
find
I
had
been
dozing
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
last
time
I
woke
I
seemed
to
come
back
from
farther
away
,
and
*NL*
thought
the
sun
had
taken
a
great
start
in
the
heavens
.
I
looked
at
the
*NL*
sprig
of
heath
,
and
at
that
I
could
have
cried
aloud
:
for
I
saw
I
had
*NL*
betrayed
my
trust
.
My
head
was
nearly
turned
with
fear
and
shame
;
and
at
*NL*
what
I
saw
,
when
I
looked
out
around
me
on
the
moor
,
my
heart
was
like
*NL*
dying
in
my
body
.
For
sure
enough
,
a
body
of
horse-soldiers
had
come
*NL*
down
during
my
sleep
,
and
were
drawing
near
to
us
from
the
south-east
,
*NL*
spread
out
in
the
shape
of
a
fan
and
riding
their
horses
to
and
fro
in
*NL*
the
deep
parts
of
the
heather
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
waked
Alan
,
he
glanced
first
at
the
soldiers
,
then
at
the
mark
*NL*
and
the
position
of
the
sun
,
and
knitted
his
brows
with
a
sudden
,
quick
*NL*
look
,
both
ugly
and
anxious
,
which
was
all
the
reproach
I
had
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
we
to
do
now
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
have
to
play
at
being
hares
,
''
said
he
.
``
Do
ye
see
yon
mountain
?
''
*NL*
pointing
to
one
on
the
north-eastern
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
''
says
he
,
``
let
us
strike
for
that
.
Its
name
is
Ben
Alder
.
*NL*
it
is
a
wild
,
desert
mountain
full
of
hills
and
hollows
,
and
if
we
can
*NL*
win
to
it
before
the
morn
,
we
may
do
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Alan
,
''
cried
I
,
``
that
will
take
us
across
the
very
coming
of
the
*NL*
soldiers
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ken
that
fine
,
''
said
he
;
``
but
if
we
are
driven
back
on
Appin
,
we
are
*NL*
two
dead
men
.
So
now
,
David
man
,
be
brisk
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
that
he
began
to
run
forward
on
his
hands
and
knees
with
an
*NL*
incredible
quickness
,
as
though
it
were
his
natural
way
of
going
.
All
*NL*
the
time
,
too
,
he
kept
winding
in
and
out
in
the
lower
parts
of
the
*NL*
moorland
where
we
were
the
best
concealed
.
Some
of
these
had
been
burned
*NL*
or
at
least
scathed
with
fire
;
and
there
rose
in
our
faces
-LRB-
which
were
*NL*
close
to
the
ground
-RRB-
a
blinding
,
choking
dust
as
fine
as
smoke
.
The
*NL*
water
was
long
out
;
and
this
posture
of
running
on
the
hands
and
knees
*NL*
brings
an
overmastering
weakness
and
weariness
,
so
that
the
joints
ache
*NL*
and
the
wrists
faint
under
your
weight
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
and
then
,
indeed
,
where
was
a
big
bush
of
heather
,
we
lay
awhile
,
*NL*
and
panted
,
and
putting
aside
the
leaves
,
looked
back
at
the
dragoons
.
*NL*
They
had
not
spied
us
,
for
they
held
straight
on
;
a
half-troop
,
I
think
,
*NL*
covering
about
two
miles
of
ground
,
and
beating
it
mighty
thoroughly
as
*NL*
they
went
.
I
had
awakened
just
in
time
;
a
little
later
,
and
we
must
have
*NL*
fled
in
front
of
them
,
instead
of
escaping
on
one
side
.
Even
as
it
was
,
*NL*
the
least
misfortune
might
betray
us
;
and
now
and
again
,
when
a
grouse
*NL*
rose
out
of
the
heather
with
a
clap
of
wings
,
we
lay
as
still
as
the
*NL*
dead
and
were
afraid
to
breathe
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
aching
and
faintness
of
my
body
,
the
labouring
of
my
heart
,
the
*NL*
soreness
of
my
hands
,
and
the
smarting
of
my
throat
and
eyes
in
the
*NL*
continual
smoke
of
dust
and
ashes
,
had
soon
grown
to
be
so
unbearable
*NL*
that
I
would
gladly
have
given
up
.
Nothing
but
the
fear
of
Alan
lent
me
*NL*
enough
of
a
false
kind
of
courage
to
continue
.
As
for
himself
-LRB-
and
you
*NL*
are
to
bear
in
mind
that
he
was
cumbered
with
a
great-coat
-RRB-
he
had
first
*NL*
turned
crimson
,
but
as
time
went
on
the
redness
began
to
be
mingled
*NL*
with
patches
of
white
;
his
breath
cried
and
whistled
as
it
came
;
and
his
*NL*
voice
,
when
he
whispered
his
observations
in
my
ear
during
our
halts
,
*NL*
sounded
like
nothing
human
.
Yet
he
seemed
in
no
way
dashed
in
spirits
,
*NL*
nor
did
he
at
all
abate
in
his
activity
,
so
that
I
was
driven
to
marvel
*NL*
at
the
man
's
endurance
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
,
in
the
first
gloaming
of
the
night
,
we
heard
a
trumpet
sound
,
*NL*
and
looking
back
from
among
the
heather
,
saw
the
troop
beginning
to
*NL*
collect
.
A
little
after
,
they
had
built
a
fire
and
camped
for
the
night
,
*NL*
about
the
middle
of
the
waste
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
I
begged
and
besought
that
we
might
lie
down
and
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
shall
be
no
sleep
the
night
!
''
said
Alan
.
``
From
now
on
,
these
*NL*
weary
dragoons
of
yours
will
keep
the
crown
of
the
muirland
,
and
none
*NL*
will
get
out
of
Appin
but
winged
fowls
.
We
got
through
in
the
nick
*NL*
of
time
,
and
shall
we
jeopard
what
we
've
gained
?
Na
,
na
,
when
the
day
*NL*
comes
,
it
shall
find
you
and
me
in
a
fast
place
on
Ben
Alder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alan
,
''
I
said
,
``
it
's
not
the
want
of
will
:
it
's
the
strength
that
I
*NL*
want
.
If
I
could
,
I
would
;
but
as
sure
as
I
'm
alive
I
can
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
then
,
''
said
Alan
.
``
I
'll
carry
ye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
looked
to
see
if
he
were
jesting
;
but
no
,
the
little
man
was
in
dead
*NL*
earnest
;
and
the
sight
of
so
much
resolution
shamed
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lead
away
!
''
said
I.
``
I
'll
follow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
gave
me
one
look
as
much
as
to
say
,
``
Well
done
,
David
!
''
and
off
he
*NL*
set
again
at
his
top
speed
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
grew
cooler
and
even
a
little
darker
-LRB-
but
not
much
-RRB-
with
the
coming
*NL*
of
the
night
.
The
sky
was
cloudless
;
it
was
still
early
in
July
,
and
*NL*
pretty
far
north
;
in
the
darkest
part
of
that
night
,
you
would
have
*NL*
needed
pretty
good
eyes
to
read
,
but
for
all
that
,
I
have
often
seen
it
*NL*
darker
in
a
winter
mid-day
.
Heavy
dew
fell
and
drenched
the
moor
like
*NL*
rain
;
and
this
refreshed
me
for
a
while
.
When
we
stopped
to
breathe
,
*NL*
and
I
had
time
to
see
all
about
me
,
the
clearness
and
sweetness
of
*NL*
the
night
,
the
shapes
of
the
hills
like
things
asleep
,
and
the
fire
*NL*
dwindling
away
behind
us
,
like
a
bright
spot
in
the
midst
of
the
moor
,
*NL*
anger
would
come
upon
me
in
a
clap
that
I
must
still
drag
myself
in
*NL*
agony
and
eat
the
dust
like
a
worm
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
what
I
have
read
in
books
,
I
think
few
that
have
held
a
pen
were
ever
*NL*
really
wearied
,
or
they
would
write
of
it
more
strongly
.
I
had
no
care
*NL*
of
my
life
,
neither
past
nor
future
,
and
I
scarce
remembered
there
was
*NL*
such
a
lad
as
David
Balfour
.
I
did
not
think
of
myself
,
but
just
of
each
*NL*
fresh
step
which
I
was
sure
would
be
my
last
,
with
despair
--
and
of
Alan
,
*NL*
who
was
the
cause
of
it
,
with
hatred
.
Alan
was
in
the
right
trade
as
a
*NL*
soldier
;
this
is
the
officer
's
part
to
make
men
continue
to
do
things
,
*NL*
they
know
not
wherefore
,
and
when
,
if
the
choice
was
offered
,
they
would
*NL*
lie
down
where
they
were
and
be
killed
.
And
I
dare
say
I
would
have
made
*NL*
a
good
enough
private
;
for
in
these
last
hours
it
never
occurred
to
me
*NL*
that
I
had
any
choice
but
just
to
obey
as
long
as
I
was
able
,
and
die
*NL*
obeying
.
*NL*
*NL*
Day
began
to
come
in
,
after
years
,
I
thought
;
and
by
that
time
we
were
*NL*
past
the
greatest
danger
,
and
could
walk
upon
our
feet
like
men
,
instead
*NL*
of
crawling
like
brutes
.
But
,
dear
heart
have
mercy
!
what
a
pair
we
must
*NL*
have
made
,
going
double
like
old
grandfathers
,
stumbling
like
babes
,
*NL*
and
as
white
as
dead
folk
.
Never
a
word
passed
between
us
;
each
set
his
*NL*
mouth
and
kept
his
eyes
in
front
of
him
,
and
lifted
up
his
foot
and
set
*NL*
it
down
again
,
like
people
lifting
weights
at
a
country
play
;
*
all
the
*NL*
while
,
with
the
moorfowl
crying
``
peep
!
''
in
the
heather
,
and
the
light
*NL*
coming
slowly
clearer
in
the
east
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
Village
fair
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
say
Alan
did
as
I
did
.
Not
that
ever
I
looked
at
him
,
for
I
had
enough
*NL*
ado
to
keep
my
feet
;
but
because
it
is
plain
he
must
have
been
as
stupid
*NL*
with
weariness
as
myself
,
and
looked
as
little
where
we
were
going
,
or
*NL*
we
should
not
have
walked
into
an
ambush
like
blind
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
fell
in
this
way
.
We
were
going
down
a
heathery
brae
,
Alan
leading
*NL*
and
I
following
a
pace
or
two
behind
,
like
a
fiddler
and
his
wife
;
when
*NL*
upon
a
sudden
the
heather
gave
a
rustle
,
three
or
four
ragged
men
leaped
*NL*
out
,
and
the
next
moment
we
were
lying
on
our
backs
,
each
with
a
dirk
at
*NL*
his
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
n't
think
I
cared
;
the
pain
of
this
rough
handling
was
quite
*NL*
swallowed
up
by
the
pains
of
which
I
was
already
full
;
and
I
was
too
*NL*
glad
to
have
stopped
walking
to
mind
about
a
dirk
.
I
lay
looking
up
in
*NL*
the
face
of
the
man
that
held
me
;
and
I
mind
his
face
was
black
with
the
*NL*
sun
,
and
his
eyes
very
light
,
but
I
was
not
afraid
of
him
.
I
heard
Alan
*NL*
and
another
whispering
in
the
Gaelic
;
and
what
they
said
was
all
one
to
*NL*
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
dirks
were
put
up
,
our
weapons
were
taken
away
,
and
we
were
set
*NL*
face
to
face
,
sitting
in
the
heather
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
Cluny
's
men
,
''
said
Alan
.
``
We
couldnae
have
fallen
better
.
*NL*
We
're
just
to
bide
here
with
these
,
which
are
his
out-sentries
,
till
*NL*
they
can
get
word
to
the
chief
of
my
arrival
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Now
Cluny
Macpherson
,
the
chief
of
the
clan
Vourich
,
had
been
one
of
the
*NL*
leaders
of
the
great
rebellion
six
years
before
;
there
was
a
price
on
*NL*
his
life
;
and
I
had
supposed
him
long
ago
in
France
,
with
the
rest
of
*NL*
the
heads
of
that
desperate
party
.
Even
tired
as
I
was
,
the
surprise
of
*NL*
what
I
heard
half
wakened
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
''
I
cried
,
``
is
Cluny
still
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
is
he
so
!
''
said
Alan
.
``
Still
in
his
own
country
and
kept
by
his
own
*NL*
clan
.
King
George
can
do
no
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
think
I
would
have
asked
farther
,
but
Alan
gave
me
the
put-off
.
``
I
am
*NL*
rather
wearied
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
I
would
like
fine
to
get
a
sleep
.
''
And
*NL*
without
more
words
,
he
rolled
on
his
face
in
a
deep
heather
bush
,
and
*NL*
seemed
to
sleep
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
such
thing
possible
for
me
.
You
have
heard
grasshoppers
*NL*
whirring
in
the
grass
in
the
summer
time
?
Well
,
I
had
no
sooner
closed
*NL*
my
eyes
,
than
my
body
,
and
above
all
my
head
,
belly
,
and
wrists
,
seemed
*NL*
to
be
filled
with
whirring
grasshoppers
;
and
I
must
open
my
eyes
again
*NL*
at
once
,
and
tumble
and
toss
,
and
sit
up
and
lie
down
;
and
look
at
the
*NL*
sky
which
dazzled
me
,
or
at
Cluny
's
wild
and
dirty
sentries
,
peering
out
*NL*
over
the
top
of
the
brae
and
chattering
to
each
other
in
the
Gaelic
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
all
the
rest
I
had
,
until
the
messenger
returned
;
when
,
as
it
*NL*
appeared
that
Cluny
would
be
glad
to
receive
us
,
we
must
get
once
more
*NL*
upon
our
feet
and
set
forward
.
Alan
was
in
excellent
good
spirits
,
much
*NL*
refreshed
by
his
sleep
,
very
hungry
,
and
looking
pleasantly
forward
to
*NL*
a
dram
and
a
dish
of
hot
collops
,
of
which
,
it
seems
,
the
messenger
had
*NL*
brought
him
word
.
For
my
part
,
it
made
me
sick
to
hear
of
eating
.
I
had
*NL*
been
dead-heavy
before
,
and
now
I
felt
a
kind
of
dreadful
lightness
,
*NL*
which
would
not
suffer
me
to
walk
.
I
drifted
like
a
gossamer
;
the
ground
*NL*
seemed
to
me
a
cloud
,
the
hills
a
feather-weight
,
the
air
to
have
a
*NL*
current
,
like
a
running
burn
,
which
carried
me
to
and
fro
.
With
all
*NL*
that
,
a
sort
of
horror
of
despair
sat
on
my
mind
,
so
that
I
could
have
*NL*
wept
at
my
own
helplessness
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
saw
Alan
knitting
his
brows
at
me
,
and
supposed
it
was
in
anger
;
and
*NL*
that
gave
me
a
pang
of
light-headed
fear
,
like
what
a
child
may
have
.
I
*NL*
remember
,
too
,
that
I
was
smiling
,
and
could
not
stop
smiling
,
hard
as
*NL*
I
tried
;
for
I
thought
it
was
out
of
place
at
such
a
time
.
But
my
good
*NL*
companion
had
nothing
in
his
mind
but
kindness
;
and
the
next
moment
,
*NL*
two
of
the
gillies
had
me
by
the
arms
,
and
I
began
to
be
carried
forward
*NL*
with
great
swiftness
-LRB-
or
so
it
appeared
to
me
,
although
I
dare
say
it
*NL*
was
slowly
enough
in
truth
-RRB-
,
through
a
labyrinth
of
dreary
glens
and
*NL*
hollows
and
into
the
heart
of
that
dismal
mountain
of
Ben
Alder
.

CHAPTER
XXIII
*NL*
*NL*
CLUNY
'S
CAGE
*NL*
*NL*
We
came
at
last
to
the
foot
of
an
exceeding
steep
wood
,
which
scrambled
*NL*
up
a
craggy
hillside
,
and
was
crowned
by
a
naked
precipice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
here
,
''
said
one
of
the
guides
,
and
we
struck
up
hill
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
trees
clung
upon
the
slope
,
like
sailors
on
the
shrouds
of
a
ship
,
*NL*
and
their
trunks
were
like
the
rounds
of
a
ladder
,
by
which
we
mounted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Quite
at
the
top
,
and
just
before
the
rocky
face
of
the
cliff
sprang
*NL*
above
the
foliage
,
we
found
that
strange
house
which
was
known
in
the
*NL*
country
as
``
Cluny
's
Cage
.
''
The
trunks
of
several
trees
had
been
wattled
*NL*
across
,
the
intervals
strengthened
with
stakes
,
and
the
ground
behind
*NL*
this
barricade
levelled
up
with
earth
to
make
the
floor
.
A
tree
,
which
*NL*
grew
out
from
the
hillside
,
was
the
living
centre-beam
of
the
roof
.
*NL*
The
walls
were
of
wattle
and
covered
with
moss
.
The
whole
house
had
*NL*
something
of
an
egg
shape
;
and
it
half
hung
,
half
stood
in
that
steep
,
*NL*
hillside
thicket
,
like
a
wasp
's
nest
in
a
green
hawthorn
.
*NL*
*NL*
Within
,
it
was
large
enough
to
shelter
five
or
six
persons
with
some
*NL*
comfort
.
A
projection
of
the
cliff
had
been
cunningly
employed
to
be
the
*NL*
fireplace
;
and
the
smoke
rising
against
the
face
of
the
rock
,
and
being
*NL*
not
dissimilar
in
colour
,
readily
escaped
notice
from
below
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
but
one
of
Cluny
's
hiding-places
;
he
had
caves
,
besides
,
and
*NL*
underground
chambers
in
several
parts
of
his
country
;
and
following
the
*NL*
reports
of
his
scouts
,
he
moved
from
one
to
another
as
the
soldiers
*NL*
drew
near
or
moved
away
.
By
this
manner
of
living
,
and
thanks
to
the
*NL*
affection
of
his
clan
,
he
had
not
only
stayed
all
this
time
in
safety
,
*NL*
while
so
many
others
had
fled
or
been
taken
and
slain
:
but
stayed
four
*NL*
or
five
years
longer
,
and
only
went
to
France
at
last
by
the
express
*NL*
command
of
his
master
.
There
he
soon
died
;
and
it
is
strange
to
reflect
*NL*
that
he
may
have
regretted
his
Cage
upon
Ben
Alder
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
came
to
the
door
he
was
seated
by
his
rock
chimney
,
watching
a
*NL*
gillie
about
some
cookery
.
He
was
mighty
plainly
habited
,
with
a
knitted
*NL*
nightcap
drawn
over
his
ears
,
and
smoked
a
foul
cutty
pipe
.
For
all
that
*NL*
he
had
the
manners
of
a
king
,
and
it
was
quite
a
sight
to
see
him
rise
*NL*
out
of
his
place
to
welcome
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Mr.
Stewart
,
come
awa
'
,
sir
!
''
said
he
,
``
and
bring
in
your
friend
*NL*
that
as
yet
I
dinna
ken
the
name
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
is
yourself
,
Cluny
?
''
said
Alan
.
``
I
hope
ye
do
brawly
,
sir
.
And
*NL*
I
am
proud
to
see
ye
,
and
to
present
to
ye
my
friend
the
Laird
of
Shaws
,
*NL*
Mr.
David
Balfour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alan
never
referred
to
my
estate
without
a
touch
of
a
sneer
,
when
we
*NL*
were
alone
;
but
with
strangers
,
he
rang
the
words
out
like
a
herald
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Step
in
by
,
the
both
of
ye
,
gentlemen
,
''
says
Cluny
.
``
I
make
ye
welcome
*NL*
to
my
house
,
which
is
a
queer
,
rude
place
for
certain
,
but
one
where
I
*NL*
have
entertained
a
royal
personage
,
Mr.
Stewart
--
ye
doubtless
ken
the
*NL*
personage
I
have
in
my
eye
.
We
'll
take
a
dram
for
luck
,
and
as
soon
as
*NL*
this
handless
man
of
mine
has
the
collops
ready
,
we
'll
dine
and
take
a
*NL*
hand
at
the
cartes
as
gentlemen
should
.
My
life
is
a
bit
driegh
,
''
says
*NL*
he
,
pouring
out
the
brandy
;
``
I
see
little
company
,
and
sit
and
twirl
my
*NL*
thumbs
,
and
mind
upon
a
great
day
that
is
gone
by
,
and
weary
for
another
*NL*
great
day
that
we
all
hope
will
be
upon
the
road
.
And
so
here
's
a
toast
*NL*
to
ye
:
The
Restoration
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thereupon
we
all
touched
glasses
and
drank
.
I
am
sure
I
wished
no
ill
*NL*
to
King
George
;
and
if
he
had
been
there
himself
in
proper
person
,
it
's
*NL*
like
he
would
have
done
as
I
did
.
No
sooner
had
I
taken
out
the
drain
*NL*
than
I
felt
hugely
better
,
and
could
look
on
and
listen
,
still
a
little
*NL*
mistily
perhaps
,
but
no
longer
with
the
same
groundless
horror
and
*NL*
distress
of
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
certainly
a
strange
place
,
and
we
had
a
strange
host
.
In
his
long
*NL*
hiding
,
Cluny
had
grown
to
have
all
manner
of
precise
habits
,
like
those
*NL*
of
an
old
maid
.
He
had
a
particular
place
,
where
no
one
else
must
sit
;
*NL*
the
Cage
was
arranged
in
a
particular
way
,
which
none
must
disturb
;
*NL*
cookery
was
one
of
his
chief
fancies
,
and
even
while
he
was
greeting
us
*NL*
in
,
he
kept
an
eye
to
the
collops
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
appears
,
he
sometimes
visited
or
received
visits
from
his
wife
and
*NL*
one
or
two
of
his
nearest
friends
,
under
the
cover
of
night
;
but
for
the
*NL*
more
part
lived
quite
alone
,
and
communicated
only
with
his
sentinels
*NL*
and
the
gillies
that
waited
on
him
in
the
Cage
.
The
first
thing
in
the
*NL*
morning
,
one
of
them
,
who
was
a
barber
,
came
and
shaved
him
,
and
gave
*NL*
him
the
news
of
the
country
,
of
which
he
was
immoderately
greedy
.
There
*NL*
was
no
end
to
his
questions
;
he
put
them
as
earnestly
as
a
child
;
and
*NL*
at
some
of
the
answers
,
laughed
out
of
all
bounds
of
reason
,
and
would
*NL*
break
out
again
laughing
at
the
mere
memory
,
hours
after
the
barber
was
*NL*
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
be
sure
,
there
might
have
been
a
purpose
in
his
questions
;
for
*NL*
though
he
was
thus
sequestered
,
and
like
the
other
landed
gentlemen
of
*NL*
Scotland
,
stripped
by
the
late
Act
of
Parliament
of
legal
powers
,
he
*NL*
still
exercised
a
patriarchal
justice
in
his
clan
.
Disputes
were
brought
*NL*
to
him
in
his
hiding-hole
to
be
decided
;
and
the
men
of
his
country
,
*NL*
who
would
have
snapped
their
fingers
at
the
Court
of
Session
,
laid
*NL*
aside
revenge
and
paid
down
money
at
the
bare
word
of
this
forfeited
and
*NL*
hunted
outlaw
.
When
he
was
angered
,
which
was
often
enough
,
he
gave
*NL*
his
commands
and
breathed
threats
of
punishment
like
any
king
;
and
his
*NL*
gillies
trembled
and
crouched
away
from
him
like
children
before
a
hasty
*NL*
father
.
With
each
of
them
,
as
he
entered
,
he
ceremoniously
shook
hands
,
*NL*
both
parties
touching
their
bonnets
at
the
same
time
in
a
military
*NL*
manner
.
Altogether
,
I
had
a
fair
chance
to
see
some
of
the
inner
*NL*
workings
of
a
Highland
clan
;
and
this
with
a
proscribed
,
fugitive
chief
;
*NL*
his
country
conquered
;
the
troops
riding
upon
all
sides
in
quest
of
*NL*
him
,
sometimes
within
a
mile
of
where
he
lay
;
and
when
the
least
of
the
*NL*
ragged
fellows
whom
he
rated
and
threatened
,
could
have
made
a
fortune
*NL*
by
betraying
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
that
first
day
,
as
soon
as
the
collops
were
ready
,
Cluny
gave
them
*NL*
with
his
own
hand
a
squeeze
of
a
lemon
-LRB-
for
he
was
well
supplied
with
*NL*
luxuries
-RRB-
and
bade
us
draw
in
to
our
meal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
,
''
said
he
,
meaning
the
collops
,
``
are
such
as
I
gave
his
Royal
*NL*
Highness
in
this
very
house
;
bating
the
lemon
juice
,
for
at
that
time
we
*NL*
were
glad
to
get
the
meat
and
never
fashed
for
kitchen
.
*
Indeed
,
there
*NL*
were
mair
dragoons
than
lemons
in
my
country
in
the
year
forty-six
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*
Condiment
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
not
know
if
the
collops
were
truly
very
good
,
but
my
heart
rose
*NL*
against
the
sight
of
them
,
and
I
could
eat
but
little
.
All
the
while
*NL*
Cluny
entertained
us
with
stories
of
Prince
Charlie
's
stay
in
the
Cage
,
*NL*
giving
us
the
very
words
of
the
speakers
,
and
rising
from
his
place
*NL*
to
show
us
where
they
stood
.
By
these
,
I
gathered
the
Prince
was
a
*NL*
gracious
,
spirited
boy
,
like
the
son
of
a
race
of
polite
kings
,
but
not
*NL*
so
wise
as
Solomon
.
I
gathered
,
too
,
that
while
he
was
in
the
Cage
,
he
*NL*
was
often
drunk
;
so
the
fault
that
has
since
,
by
all
accounts
,
made
such
*NL*
a
wreck
of
him
,
had
even
then
begun
to
show
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
no
sooner
done
eating
than
Cluny
brought
out
an
old
,
thumbed
,
*NL*
greasy
pack
of
cards
,
such
as
you
may
find
in
a
mean
inn
;
and
his
eyes
*NL*
brightened
in
his
face
as
he
proposed
that
we
should
fall
to
playing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
this
was
one
of
the
things
I
had
been
brought
up
to
eschew
like
*NL*
disgrace
;
it
being
held
by
my
father
neither
the
part
of
a
Christian
*NL*
nor
yet
of
a
gentleman
to
set
his
own
livelihood
and
fish
for
that
of
*NL*
others
,
on
the
cast
of
painted
pasteboard
.
To
be
sure
,
I
might
have
*NL*
pleaded
my
fatigue
,
which
was
excuse
enough
;
but
I
thought
it
behoved
*NL*
that
I
should
bear
a
testimony
.
I
must
have
got
very
red
in
the
face
,
*NL*
but
I
spoke
steadily
,
and
told
them
I
had
no
call
to
be
a
judge
*NL*
of
others
,
but
for
my
own
part
,
it
was
a
matter
in
which
I
had
no
*NL*
clearness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cluny
stopped
mingling
the
cards
.
``
What
in
deil
's
name
is
this
?
''
says
*NL*
he
.
``
What
kind
of
Whiggish
,
canting
talk
is
this
,
for
the
house
of
Cluny
*NL*
Macpherson
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
put
my
hand
in
the
fire
for
Mr.
Balfour
,
''
says
Alan
.
``
He
is
an
*NL*
honest
and
a
mettle
gentleman
,
and
I
would
have
ye
bear
in
mind
who
says
*NL*
it
.
I
bear
a
king
's
name
,
''
says
he
,
cocking
his
hat
;
``
and
I
and
any
that
*NL*
I
call
friend
are
company
for
the
best
.
But
the
gentleman
is
tired
,
and
*NL*
should
sleep
;
if
he
has
no
mind
to
the
cartes
,
it
will
never
hinder
you
*NL*
and
me
.
And
I
'm
fit
and
willing
,
sir
,
to
play
ye
any
game
that
ye
can
*NL*
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
says
Cluny
,
``
in
this
poor
house
of
mine
I
would
have
you
to
ken
*NL*
that
any
gentleman
may
follow
his
pleasure
.
If
your
friend
would
like
to
*NL*
stand
on
his
head
,
he
is
welcome
.
And
if
either
he
,
or
you
,
or
any
other
*NL*
man
,
is
not
preceesely
satisfied
,
I
will
be
proud
to
step
outside
with
*NL*
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
no
will
that
these
two
friends
should
cut
their
throats
for
my
*NL*
sake
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
said
I
,
``
I
am
very
wearied
,
as
Alan
says
;
and
what
's
more
,
as
*NL*
you
are
a
man
that
likely
has
sons
of
your
own
,
I
may
tell
you
it
was
a
*NL*
promise
to
my
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
nae
mair
,
say
nae
mair
,
''
said
Cluny
,
and
pointed
me
to
a
bed
of
*NL*
heather
in
a
corner
of
the
Cage
.
For
all
that
he
was
displeased
enough
,
*NL*
looked
at
me
askance
,
and
grumbled
when
he
looked
.
And
indeed
it
must
*NL*
be
owned
that
both
my
scruples
and
the
words
in
which
I
declared
them
,
*NL*
smacked
somewhat
of
the
Covenanter
,
and
were
little
in
their
place
among
*NL*
wild
Highland
Jacobites
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
with
the
brandy
and
the
venison
,
a
strange
heaviness
had
come
over
*NL*
me
;
and
I
had
scarce
lain
down
upon
the
bed
before
I
fell
into
a
kind
*NL*
of
trance
,
in
which
I
continued
almost
the
whole
time
of
our
stay
in
the
*NL*
Cage
.
Sometimes
I
was
broad
awake
and
understood
what
passed
;
sometimes
*NL*
I
only
heard
voices
,
or
men
snoring
,
like
the
voice
of
a
silly
river
;
*NL*
and
the
plaids
upon
the
wall
dwindled
down
and
swelled
out
again
,
like
*NL*
firelight
shadows
on
the
roof
.
I
must
sometimes
have
spoken
or
cried
*NL*
out
,
for
I
remember
I
was
now
and
then
amazed
at
being
answered
;
yet
*NL*
I
was
conscious
of
no
particular
nightmare
,
only
of
a
general
,
black
,
*NL*
abiding
horror
--
a
horror
of
the
place
I
was
in
,
and
the
bed
I
lay
in
,
*NL*
and
the
plaids
on
the
wall
,
and
the
voices
,
and
the
fire
,
and
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
barber-gillie
,
who
was
a
doctor
too
,
was
called
in
to
prescribe
*NL*
for
me
;
but
as
he
spoke
in
the
Gaelic
,
I
understood
not
a
word
of
his
*NL*
opinion
,
and
was
too
sick
even
to
ask
for
a
translation
.
I
knew
well
*NL*
enough
I
was
ill
,
and
that
was
all
I
cared
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
paid
little
heed
while
I
lay
in
this
poor
pass
.
But
Alan
and
Cluny
*NL*
were
most
of
the
time
at
the
cards
,
and
I
am
clear
that
Alan
must
have
*NL*
begun
by
winning
;
for
I
remember
sitting
up
,
and
seeing
them
hard
at
it
,
*NL*
and
a
great
glittering
pile
of
as
much
as
sixty
or
a
hundred
guineas
on
*NL*
the
table
.
It
looked
strange
enough
,
to
see
all
this
wealth
in
a
nest
*NL*
upon
a
cliff-side
,
wattled
about
growing
trees
.
And
even
then
,
I
*NL*
thought
it
seemed
deep
water
for
Alan
to
be
riding
,
who
had
no
better
*NL*
battle-horse
than
a
green
purse
and
a
matter
of
five
pounds
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
luck
,
it
seems
,
changed
on
the
second
day
.
About
noon
I
was
wakened
*NL*
as
usual
for
dinner
,
and
as
usual
refused
to
eat
,
and
was
given
a
dram
*NL*
with
some
bitter
infusion
which
the
barber
had
prescribed
.
The
sun
was
*NL*
shining
in
at
the
open
door
of
the
Cage
,
and
this
dazzled
and
offended
*NL*
me
.
Cluny
sat
at
the
table
,
biting
the
pack
of
cards
.
Alan
had
stooped
*NL*
over
the
bed
,
and
had
his
face
close
to
my
eyes
;
to
which
,
troubled
as
*NL*
they
were
with
the
fever
,
it
seemed
of
the
most
shocking
bigness
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
asked
me
for
a
loan
of
my
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
for
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
just
for
a
loan
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
?
''
I
repeated
.
``
I
do
n't
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hut
,
David
!
''
said
Alan
,
``
ye
wouldnae
grudge
me
a
loan
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
would
,
though
,
if
I
had
had
my
senses
!
But
all
I
thought
of
then
was
*NL*
to
get
his
face
away
,
and
I
handed
him
my
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
morning
of
the
third
day
,
when
we
had
been
forty-eight
hours
in
*NL*
the
Cage
,
I
awoke
with
a
great
relief
of
spirits
,
very
weak
and
weary
*NL*
indeed
,
but
seeing
things
of
the
right
size
and
with
their
honest
,
*NL*
everyday
appearance
.
I
had
a
mind
to
eat
,
moreover
,
rose
from
bed
of
my
*NL*
own
movement
,
and
as
soon
as
we
had
breakfasted
,
stepped
to
the
entry
of
*NL*
the
Cage
and
sat
down
outside
in
the
top
of
the
wood
.
It
was
a
grey
day
*NL*
with
a
cool
,
mild
air
:
and
I
sat
in
a
dream
all
morning
,
only
disturbed
*NL*
by
the
passing
by
of
Cluny
's
scouts
and
servants
coming
with
provisions
*NL*
and
reports
;
for
as
the
coast
was
at
that
time
clear
,
you
might
almost
*NL*
say
he
held
court
openly
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
returned
,
he
and
Alan
had
laid
the
cards
aside
,
and
were
*NL*
questioning
a
gillie
;
and
the
chief
turned
about
and
spoke
to
me
in
the
*NL*
Gaelic
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
Gaelic
,
sir
,
''
said
I
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
since
the
card
question
,
everything
I
said
or
did
had
the
power
of
*NL*
annoying
Cluny
.
``
Your
name
has
more
sense
than
yourself
,
then
,
''
said
he
*NL*
angrily
,
``
for
it
's
good
Gaelic
.
But
the
point
is
this
.
My
scout
reports
*NL*
all
clear
in
the
south
,
and
the
question
is
,
have
ye
the
strength
to
*NL*
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
saw
cards
on
the
table
,
but
no
gold
;
only
a
heap
of
little
written
*NL*
papers
,
and
these
all
on
Cluny
's
side
.
Alan
,
besides
,
had
an
odd
*NL*
look
,
like
a
man
not
very
well
content
;
and
I
began
to
have
a
strong
*NL*
misgiving
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
know
if
I
am
as
well
as
I
should
be
,
''
said
I
,
looking
at
Alan
;
*NL*
``
but
the
little
money
we
have
has
a
long
way
to
carry
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alan
took
his
under-lip
into
his
mouth
,
and
looked
upon
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
David
,
''
says
he
at
last
,
``
I
've
lost
it
;
there
's
the
naked
truth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
money
too
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
money
too
,
''
says
Alan
,
with
a
groan
.
``
Ye
shouldnae
have
given
it
*NL*
me
.
I
'm
daft
when
I
get
to
the
cartes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hoot-toot
!
hoot-toot
!
''
said
Cluny
.
``
It
was
all
daffing
;
it
's
all
*NL*
nonsense
.
Of
course
you
'll
have
your
money
back
again
,
and
the
double
of
*NL*
it
,
if
ye
'll
make
so
free
with
me
.
It
would
be
a
singular
thing
for
me
*NL*
to
keep
it
.
It
's
not
to
be
supposed
that
I
would
be
any
hindrance
to
*NL*
gentlemen
in
your
situation
;
that
would
be
a
singular
thing
!
''
cries
he
,
*NL*
and
began
to
pull
gold
out
of
his
pocket
with
a
mighty
red
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alan
said
nothing
,
only
looked
on
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
step
to
the
door
with
me
,
sir
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
Cluny
said
he
would
be
very
glad
,
and
followed
me
readily
enough
,
but
he
*NL*
looked
flustered
and
put
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
sir
,
''
says
I
,
``
I
must
first
acknowledge
your
generosity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsensical
nonsense
!
''
cries
Cluny
.
``
Where
's
the
generosity
?
This
is
*NL*
just
a
most
unfortunate
affair
;
but
what
would
ye
have
me
do
--
boxed
*NL*
up
in
this
bee-skep
of
a
cage
of
mine
--
but
just
set
my
friends
to
the
*NL*
cartes
,
when
I
can
get
them
?
And
if
they
lose
,
of
course
,
it
's
not
to
be
*NL*
supposed
--
''
And
here
he
came
to
a
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
I
,
``
if
they
lose
,
you
give
them
back
their
money
;
and
if
*NL*
they
win
,
they
carry
away
yours
in
their
pouches
!
I
have
said
before
*NL*
that
I
grant
your
generosity
;
but
to
me
,
sir
,
it
's
a
very
painful
thing
*NL*
to
be
placed
in
this
position
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
little
silence
,
in
which
Cluny
seemed
always
as
if
he
was
*NL*
about
to
speak
,
but
said
nothing
.
All
the
time
he
grew
redder
and
redder
*NL*
in
the
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
a
young
man
,
''
said
I
,
``
and
I
ask
your
advice
.
Advise
me
as
you
*NL*
would
your
son
.
My
friend
fairly
lost
his
money
,
after
having
fairly
*NL*
gained
a
far
greater
sum
of
yours
;
can
I
accept
it
back
again
?
Would
*NL*
that
be
the
right
part
for
me
to
play
?
Whatever
I
do
,
you
can
see
for
*NL*
yourself
it
must
be
hard
upon
a
man
of
any
pride
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
rather
hard
on
me
,
too
,
Mr.
Balfour
,
''
said
Cluny
,
``
and
ye
give
*NL*
me
very
much
the
look
of
a
man
that
has
entrapped
poor
people
to
their
*NL*
hurt
.
I
wouldnae
have
my
friends
come
to
any
house
of
mine
to
accept
*NL*
affronts
;
no
,
''
he
cried
,
with
a
sudden
heat
of
anger
,
``
nor
yet
to
give
*NL*
them
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
you
see
,
sir
,
''
said
I
,
``
there
is
something
to
be
said
upon
my
*NL*
side
;
and
this
gambling
is
a
very
poor
employ
for
gentlefolks
.
But
I
am
*NL*
still
waiting
your
opinion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
sure
if
ever
Cluny
hated
any
man
it
was
David
Balfour
.
He
looked
*NL*
me
all
over
with
a
warlike
eye
,
and
I
saw
the
challenge
at
his
lips
.
*NL*
But
either
my
youth
disarmed
him
,
or
perhaps
his
own
sense
of
justice
.
*NL*
Certainly
it
was
a
mortifying
matter
for
all
concerned
,
and
not
least
*NL*
Cluny
;
the
more
credit
that
he
took
it
as
he
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Balfour
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
think
you
are
too
nice
and
covenanting
,
but
*NL*
for
all
that
you
have
the
spirit
of
a
very
pretty
gentleman
.
Upon
my
*NL*
honest
word
,
ye
may
take
this
money
--
it
's
what
I
would
tell
my
son

here
's
my
hand
along
with
it

CHAPTER

THE
FLIGHT
IN

HEATHER
:
THE
QUARREL
*NL*
*NL*
Alan
and
I
were
put
across
Loch
Errocht
under
cloud
of
night
,
and
went
*NL*
down
its
eastern
shore
to
another
hiding-place
near
the
head
of
Loch
*NL*
Rannoch
,
whither
we
were
led
by
one
of
the
gillies
from
the
Cage
.
This
*NL*
fellow
carried
all
our
luggage
and
Alan
's
great-coat
in
the
bargain
,
*NL*
trotting
along
under
the
burthen
,
far
less
than
the
half
of
which
used
*NL*
to
weigh
me
to
the
ground
,
like
a
stout
hill
pony
with
a
feather
;
yet
he
*NL*
was
a
man
that
,
in
plain
contest
,
I
could
have
broken
on
my
knee
.
*NL*
*NL*
Doubtless
it
was
a
great
relief
to
walk
disencumbered
;
and
perhaps
*NL*
without
that
relief
,
and
the
consequent
sense
of
liberty
and
lightness
,
*NL*
I
could
not
have
walked
at
all
.
I
was
but
new
risen
from
a
bed
of
*NL*
sickness
;
and
there
was
nothing
in
the
state
of
our
affairs
to
hearten
*NL*
me
for
much
exertion
;
travelling
,
as
we
did
,
over
the
most
dismal
*NL*
deserts
in
Scotland
,
under
a
cloudy
heaven
,
and
with
divided
hearts
*NL*
among
the
travellers
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
long
,
we
said
nothing
;
marching
alongside
or
one
behind
the
other
,
*NL*
each
with
a
set
countenance
:
I
,
angry
and
proud
,
and
drawing
what
*NL*
strength
I
had
from
these
two
violent
and
sinful
feelings
;
Alan
angry
*NL*
and
ashamed
,
ashamed
that
he
had
lost
my
money
,
angry
that
I
should
take
*NL*
it
so
ill
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
thought
of
a
separation
ran
always
the
stronger
in
my
mind
;
and
the
*NL*
more
I
approved
of
it
,
the
more
ashamed
I
grew
of
my
approval
.
It
would
*NL*
be
a
fine
,
handsome
,
generous
thing
,
indeed
,
for
Alan
to
turn
round
and
*NL*
say
to
me
:
``
Go
,
I
am
in
the
most
danger
,
and
my
company
only
increases
*NL*
yours
.
''
But
for
me
to
turn
to
the
friend
who
certainly
loved
me
,
and
say
*NL*
to
him
:
``
You
are
in
great
danger
,
I
am
in
but
little
;
your
friendship
*NL*
is
a
burden
;
go
,
take
your
risks
and
bear
your
hardships
alone
--
''
no
,
*NL*
that
was
impossible
;
and
even
to
think
of
it
privily
to
myself
,
made
my
*NL*
cheeks
to
burn
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
Alan
had
behaved
like
a
child
,
and
-LRB-
what
is
worse
-RRB-
a
treacherous
*NL*
child
.
Wheedling
my
money
from
me
while
I
lay
half-conscious
was
scarce
*NL*
better
than
theft
;
and
yet
here
he
was
trudging
by
my
side
,
without
a
*NL*
penny
to
his
name
,
and
by
what
I
could
see
,
quite
blithe
to
sponge
upon
*NL*
the
money
he
had
driven
me
to
beg
.
True
,
I
was
ready
to
share
it
with
*NL*
him
;
but
it
made
me
rage
to
see
him
count
upon
my
readiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
were
the
two
things
uppermost
in
my
mind
;
and
I
could
open
my
*NL*
mouth
upon
neither
without
black
ungenerosity
.
So
I
did
the
next
worst
,
*NL*
and
said
nothing
,
nor
so
much
as
looked
once
at
my
companion
,
save
with
*NL*
the
tail
of
my
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
upon
the
other
side
of
Loch
Errocht
,
going
over
a
smooth
,
rushy
*NL*
place
,
where
the
walking
was
easy
,
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
,
and
came
*NL*
close
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
David
,
''
says
he
,
``
this
is
no
way
for
two
friends
to
take
a
small
*NL*
accident
.
I
have
to
say
that
I
'm
sorry
;
and
so
that
's
said
.
And
now
if
*NL*
you
have
anything
,
ye
'd
better
say
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
''
says
I
,
``
I
have
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
seemed
disconcerted
;
at
which
I
was
meanly
pleased
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
he
,
with
rather
a
trembling
voice
,
``
but
when
I
say
I
was
to
*NL*
blame
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
of
course
,
ye
were
to
blame
,
''
said
I
,
coolly
;
``
and
you
will
bear
*NL*
me
out
that
I
have
never
reproached
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
,
''
says
he
;
``
but
ye
ken
very
well
that
ye
've
done
worse
.
Are
we
to
*NL*
part
?
Ye
said
so
once
before
.
Are
ye
to
say
it
again
?
There
's
hills
and
*NL*
heather
enough
between
here
and
the
two
seas
,
David
;
and
I
will
own
I
'm
*NL*
no
very
keen
to
stay
where
I
'm
no
wanted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
pierced
me
like
a
sword
,
and
seemed
to
lay
bare
my
private
*NL*
disloyalty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alan
Breck
!
''
I
cried
;
and
then
:
``
Do
you
think
I
am
one
to
turn
my
*NL*
back
on
you
in
your
chief
need
?
You
durs
n't
say
it
to
my
face
.
My
whole
*NL*
conduct
's
there
to
give
the
lie
to
it
.
It
's
true
,
I
fell
asleep
upon
*NL*
the
muir
;
but
that
was
from
weariness
,
and
you
do
wrong
to
cast
it
up
to
*NL*
me
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
is
what
I
never
did
,
''
said
Alan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
aside
from
that
,
''
I
continued
,
``
what
have
I
done
that
you
should
*NL*
even
me
to
dogs
by
such
a
supposition
?
I
never
yet
failed
a
friend
,
and
*NL*
it
's
not
likely
I
'll
begin
with
you
.
There
are
things
between
us
that
I
*NL*
can
never
forget
,
even
if
you
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
only
say
this
to
ye
,
David
,
''
said
Alan
,
very
quietly
,
``
that
I
*NL*
have
long
been
owing
ye
my
life
,
and
now
I
owe
ye
money
.
Ye
should
try
*NL*
to
make
that
burden
light
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
ought
to
have
touched
me
,
and
in
a
manner
it
did
,
but
the
wrong
*NL*
manner
.
I
felt
I
was
behaving
badly
;
and
was
now
not
only
angry
with
*NL*
Alan
,
but
angry
with
myself
in
the
bargain
;
and
it
made
me
the
more
*NL*
cruel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
asked
me
to
speak
,
''
said
I.
``
Well
,
then
,
I
will
.
You
own
yourself
*NL*
that
you
have
done
me
a
disservice
;
I
have
had
to
swallow
an
affront
:
I
*NL*
have
never
reproached
you
,
I
never
named
the
thing
till
you
did
.
And
*NL*
now
you
blame
me
,
''
cried
I
,
``
because
I
cannae
laugh
and
sing
as
if
I
was
*NL*
glad
to
be
affronted
.
The
next
thing
will
be
that
I
'm
to
go
down
upon
my
*NL*
knees
and
thank
you
for
it
!
Ye
should
think
more
of
others
,
Alan
*NL*
Breck
.
If
ye
thought
more
of
others
,
ye
would
perhaps
speak
less
about
*NL*
yourself
;
and
when
a
friend
that
likes
you
very
well
has
passed
over
an
*NL*
offence
without
a
word
,
you
would
be
blithe
to
let
it
lie
,
instead
of
*NL*
making
it
a
stick
to
break
his
back
with
.
By
your
own
way
of
it
,
it
was
*NL*
you
that
was
to
blame
;
then
it
shouldnae
be
you
to
seek
the
quarrel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aweel
,
''
said
Alan
,
``
say
nae
mair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
we
fell
back
into
our
former
silence
;
and
came
to
our
journey
's
end
,
*NL*
and
supped
,
and
lay
down
to
sleep
,
without
another
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gillie
put
us
across
Loch
Rannoch
in
the
dusk
of
the
next
day
,
and
*NL*
gave
us
his
opinion
as
to
our
best
route
.
This
was
to
get
us
up
at
once
*NL*
into
the
tops
of
the
mountains
:
to
go
round
by
a
circuit
,
turning
the
*NL*
heads
of
Glen
Lyon
,
Glen
Lochay
,
and
Glen
Dochart
,
and
come
down
upon
*NL*
the
lowlands
by
Kippen
and
the
upper
waters
of
the
Forth
.
Alan
was
*NL*
little
pleased
with
a
route
which
led
us
through
the
country
of
his
*NL*
blood-foes
,
the
Glenorchy
Campbells
.
He
objected
that
by
turning
to
the
*NL*
east
,
we
should
come
almost
at
once
among
the
Athole
Stewarts
,
a
race
of
*NL*
his
own
name
and
lineage
,
although
following
a
different
chief
,
and
come
*NL*
besides
by
a
far
easier
and
swifter
way
to
the
place
whither
we
were
*NL*
bound
.
But
the
gillie
,
who
was
indeed
the
chief
man
of
Cluny
's
scouts
,
*NL*
had
good
reasons
to
give
him
on
all
hands
,
naming
the
force
of
troops
*NL*
in
every
district
,
and
alleging
finally
-LRB-
as
well
as
I
could
understand
-RRB-
*NL*
that
we
should
nowhere
be
so
little
troubled
as
in
a
country
of
the
*NL*
Campbells
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alan
gave
way
at
last
,
but
with
only
half
a
heart
.
``
It
's
one
of
the
*NL*
dowiest
countries
in
Scotland
,
''
said
he
.
``
There
's
naething
there
that
I
*NL*
ken
,
but
heath
,
and
crows
,
and
Campbells
.
But
I
see
that
ye
're
a
man
of
*NL*
some
penetration
;
and
be
it
as
ye
please
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
set
forth
accordingly
by
this
itinerary
;
and
for
the
best
part
of
*NL*
three
nights
travelled
on
eerie
mountains
and
among
the
well-heads
of
*NL*
wild
rivers
;
often
buried
in
mist
,
almost
continually
blown
and
rained
*NL*
upon
,
and
not
once
cheered
by
any
glimpse
of
sunshine
.
By
day
,
we
lay
*NL*
and
slept
in
the
drenching
heather
;
by
night
,
incessantly
clambered
upon
*NL*
break-neck
hills
and
among
rude
crags
.
We
often
wandered
;
we
were
often
*NL*
so
involved
in
fog
,
that
we
must
lie
quiet
till
it
lightened
.
A
fire
was
*NL*
never
to
be
thought
of
.
Our
only
food
was
drammach
and
a
portion
of
cold
*NL*
meat
that
we
had
carried
from
the
Cage
;
and
as
for
drink
,
Heaven
knows
*NL*
we
had
no
want
of
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
dreadful
time
,
rendered
the
more
dreadful
by
the
gloom
of
*NL*
the
weather
and
the
country
.
I
was
never
warm
;
my
teeth
chattered
in
my
*NL*
head
;
I
was
troubled
with
a
very
sore
throat
,
such
as
I
had
on
the
isle
;
*NL*
I
had
a
painful
stitch
in
my
side
,
which
never
left
me
;
and
when
I
slept
*NL*
in
my
wet
bed
,
with
the
rain
beating
above
and
the
mud
oozing
below
me
,
*NL*
it
was
to
live
over
again
in
fancy
the
worst
part
of
my
adventures
--
to
*NL*
see
the
tower
of
Shaws
lit
by
lightning
,
Ransome
carried
below
on
the
*NL*
men
's
backs
,
Shuan
dying
on
the
round-house
floor
,
or
Colin
Campbell
*NL*
grasping
at
the
bosom
of
his
coat
.
From
such
broken
slumbers
,
I
would
be
*NL*
aroused
in
the
gloaming
,
to
sit
up
in
the
same
puddle
where
I
had
slept
,
*NL*
and
sup
cold
drammach
;
the
rain
driving
sharp
in
my
face
or
running
*NL*
down
my
back
in
icy
trickles
;
the
mist
enfolding
us
like
as
in
a
gloomy
*NL*
chamber
--
or
,
perhaps
,
if
the
wind
blew
,
falling
suddenly
apart
and
*NL*
showing
us
the
gulf
of
some
dark
valley
where
the
streams
were
crying
*NL*
aloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sound
of
an
infinite
number
of
rivers
came
up
from
all
round
.
In
*NL*
this
steady
rain
the
springs
of
the
mountain
were
broken
up
;
every
glen
*NL*
gushed
water
like
a
cistern
;
every
stream
was
in
high
spate
,
and
had
*NL*
filled
and
overflowed
its
channel
.
During
our
night
tramps
,
it
was
*NL*
solemn
to
hear
the
voice
of
them
below
in
the
valleys
,
now
booming
like
*NL*
thunder
,
now
with
an
angry
cry
.
I
could
well
understand
the
story
of
the
*NL*
Water
Kelpie
,
that
demon
of
the
streams
,
who
is
fabled
to
keep
wailing
*NL*
and
roaring
at
the
ford
until
the
coming
of
the
doomed
traveller
.
Alan
I
*NL*
saw
believed
it
,
or
half
believed
it
;
and
when
the
cry
of
the
river
rose
*NL*
more
than
usually
sharp
,
I
was
little
surprised
-LRB-
though
,
of
course
,
I
*NL*
would
still
be
shocked
-RRB-
to
see
him
cross
himself
in
the
manner
of
the
*NL*
Catholics
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
all
these
horrid
wanderings
we
had
no
familiarity
,
scarcely
even
*NL*
that
of
speech
.
The
truth
is
that
I
was
sickening
for
my
grave
,
which
*NL*
is
my
best
excuse
.
But
besides
that
I
was
of
an
unforgiving
disposition
*NL*
from
my
birth
,
slow
to
take
offence
,
slower
to
forget
it
,
and
now
*NL*
incensed
both
against
my
companion
and
myself
.
For
the
best
part
of
two
*NL*
days
he
was
unweariedly
kind
;
silent
,
indeed
,
but
always
ready
to
help
,
*NL*
and
always
hoping
-LRB-
as
I
could
very
well
see
-RRB-
that
my
displeasure
would
*NL*
blow
by
.
For
the
same
length
of
time
I
stayed
in
myself
,
nursing
my
*NL*
anger
,
roughly
refusing
his
services
,
and
passing
him
over
with
my
eyes
*NL*
as
if
he
had
been
a
bush
or
a
stone
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
second
night
,
or
rather
the
peep
of
the
third
day
,
found
us
upon
a
*NL*
very
open
hill
,
so
that
we
could
not
follow
our
usual
plan
and
lie
down
*NL*
immediately
to
eat
and
sleep
.
Before
we
had
reached
a
place
of
shelter
,
*NL*
the
grey
had
come
pretty
clear
,
for
though
it
still
rained
,
the
clouds
*NL*
ran
higher
;
and
Alan
,
looking
in
my
face
,
showed
some
marks
of
concern
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye
had
better
let
me
take
your
pack
,
''
said
he
,
for
perhaps
the
ninth
*NL*
time
since
we
had
parted
from
the
scout
beside
Loch
Rannoch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
very
well
,
I
thank
you
,
''
said
I
,
as
cold
as
ice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alan
flushed
darkly
.
``
I
'll
not
offer
it
again
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
'm
not
a
*NL*
patient
man
,
David
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
said
you
were
,
''
said
I
,
which
was
exactly
the
rude
,
silly
*NL*
speech
of
a
boy
of
ten
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alan
made
no
answer
at
the
time
,
but
his
conduct
answered
for
him
.
*NL*
Henceforth
,
it
is
to
be
thought
,
he
quite
forgave
himself
for
the
affair
*NL*
at
Cluny
's
;
cocked
his
hat
again
,
walked
jauntily
,
whistled
airs
,
and
*NL*
looked
at
me
upon
one
side
with
a
provoking
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
third
night
we
were
to
pass
through
the
western
end
of
the
country
*NL*
of
Balquhidder
.
It
came
clear
and
cold
,
with
a
touch
in
the
air
like
*NL*
frost
,
and
a
northerly
wind
that
blew
the
clouds
away
and
made
the
stars
*NL*
bright
.
The
streams
were
full
,
of
course
,
and
still
made
a
great
noise
*NL*
among
the
hills
;
but
I
observed
that
Alan
thought
no
more
upon
the
*NL*
Kelpie
,
and
was
in
high
good
spirits
.
As
for
me
,
the
change
of
weather
*NL*
came
too
late
;
I
had
lain
in
the
mire
so
long
that
-LRB-
as
the
Bible
has
it
-RRB-
*NL*
my
very
clothes
``
abhorred
me
.
''
I
was
dead
weary
,
deadly
sick
and
full
*NL*
of
pains
and
shiverings
;
the
chill
of
the
wind
went
through
me
,
and
the
*NL*
sound
of
it
confused
my
ears
.
In
this
poor
state
I
had
to
bear
from
*NL*
my
companion
something
in
the
nature
of
a
persecution
.
He
spoke
a
good
*NL*
deal
,
and
never
without
a
taunt
.
``
Whig
''
was
the
best
name
he
had
to
give
*NL*
me
.
``
Here
,
''
he
would
say
,
``
here
's
a
dub
for
ye
to
jump
,
my
Whiggie
!
I
*NL*
ken
you
're
a
fine
jumper
!
''
And
so
on
;
all
the
time
with
a
gibing
voice
*NL*
and
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
knew
it
was
my
own
doing
,
and
no
one
else
's
;
but
I
was
too
miserable
*NL*
to
repent
.
I
felt
I
could
drag
myself
but
little
farther
;
pretty
soon
,
I
*NL*
must
lie
down
and
die
on
these
wet
mountains
like
a
sheep
or
a
fox
,
and
*NL*
my
bones
must
whiten
there
like
the
bones
of
a
beast
.
My
head
was
light
*NL*
perhaps
;
but
I
began
to
love
the
prospect
,
I
began
to
glory
in
the
*NL*
thought
of
such
a
death
,
alone
in
the
desert
,
with
the
wild
eagles
*NL*
besieging
my
last
moments
.
Alan
would
repent
then
,
I
thought
;
he
would
*NL*
remember
,
when
I
was
dead
,
how
much
he
owed
me
,
and
the
remembrance
*NL*
would
be
torture
.
So
I
went
like
a
sick
,
silly
,
and
bad-hearted
*NL*
schoolboy
,
feeding
my
anger
against
a
fellow-man
,
when
I
would
have
*NL*
been
better
on
my
knees
,
crying
on
God
for
mercy
.
And
at
each
of
Alan
's
*NL*
taunts
,
I
hugged
myself
.
``
Ah
!
''
thinks
I
to
myself
,
``
I
have
a
better
*NL*
taunt
in
readiness
;
when
I
lie
down
and
die
,
you
will
feel
it
like
a
*NL*
buffet
in
your
face
;
ah
,
what
a
revenge
!
ah
,
how
you
will
regret
your
*NL*
ingratitude
and
cruelty
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
while
,
I
was
growing
worse
and
worse
.
Once
I
had
fallen
,
my
leg
*NL*
simply
doubling
under
me
,
and
this
had
struck
Alan
for
the
moment
;
but
I
*NL*
was
afoot
so
briskly
,
and
set
off
again
with
such
a
natural
manner
,
*NL*
that
he
soon
forgot
the
incident
.
Flushes
of
heat
went
over
me
,
and
then
*NL*
spasms
of
shuddering
.
The
stitch
in
my
side
was
hardly
bearable
.
At
last
*NL*
I
began
to
feel
that
I
could
trail
myself
no
farther
:
and
with
that
,
*NL*
there
came
on
me
all
at
once
the
wish
to
have
it
out
with
Alan
,
let
my
*NL*
anger
blaze
,
and
be
done
with
my
life
in
a
more
sudden
manner
.
He
had
*NL*
just
called
me
``
Whig
.
''
I
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Stewart
,
''
said
I
,
in
a
voice
that
quivered
like
a
fiddle-string
,
*NL*
``
you
are
older
than
I
am
,
and
should
know
your
manners
.
Do
you
think
*NL*
it
either
very
wise
or
very
witty
to
cast
my
politics
in
my
teeth
?
I
*NL*
thought
,
where
folk
differed
,
it
was
the
part
of
gentlemen
to
differ
*NL*
civilly
;
and
if
I
did
not
,
I
may
tell
you
I
could
find
a
better
taunt
*NL*
than
some
of
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alan
had
stopped
opposite
to
me
,
his
hat
cocked
,
his
hands
in
his
*NL*
breeches
pockets
,
his
head
a
little
on
one
side
.
He
listened
,
smiling
*NL*
evilly
,
as
I
could
see
by
the
starlight
;
and
when
I
had
done
he
began
to
*NL*
whistle
a
Jacobite
air
.
It
was
the
air
made
in
mockery
of
General
Cope
's
*NL*
defeat
at
Preston
Pans
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hey
,
Johnnie
Cope
,
are
ye
waukin
'
yet
?
*NL*
And
are
your
drums
a-beatin
'
yet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
it
came
in
my
mind
that
Alan
,
on
the
day
of
that
battle
,
had
been
*NL*
engaged
upon
the
royal
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
ye
take
that
air
,
Mr.
Stewart
?
''
said
I.
``
Is
that
to
remind
me
*NL*
you
have
been
beaten
on
both
sides
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
air
stopped
on
Alan
's
lips
.
``
David
!
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
's
time
these
manners
ceased
,
''
I
continued
;
``
and
I
mean
you
shall
*NL*
henceforth
speak
civilly
of
my
King
and
my
good
friends
the
Campbells
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
a
Stewart
--
''
began
Alan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
!
''
says
I
,
``
I
ken
ye
bear
a
king
's
name
.
But
you
are
to
remember
,
*NL*
since
I
have
been
in
the
Highlands
,
I
have
seen
a
good
many
of
those
*NL*
that
bear
it
;
and
the
best
I
can
say
of
them
is
this
,
that
they
would
be
*NL*
none
the
worse
of
washing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
that
you
insult
me
?
''
said
Alan
,
very
low
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
for
that
,
''
said
I
,
``
for
I
am
not
done
;
and
if
you
distaste
*NL*
the
sermon
,
I
doubt
the
pirliecue
*
will
please
you
as
little
.
You
have
*NL*
been
chased
in
the
field
by
the
grown
men
of
my
party
;
it
seems
a
poor
*NL*
kind
of
pleasure
to
out-face
a
boy
.
Both
the
Campbells
and
the
Whigs
*NL*
have
beaten
you
;
you
have
run
before
them
like
a
hare
.
It
behoves
you
to
*NL*
speak
of
them
as
of
your
betters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*
A
second
sermon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alan
stood
quite
still
,
the
tails
of
his
great-coat
clapping
behind
him
*NL*
in
the
wind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
a
pity
,
''
he
said
at
last
.
``
There
are
things
said
that
can
not
be
*NL*
passed
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
asked
you
to
,
''
said
I.
``
I
am
as
ready
as
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ready
?
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ready
,
''
I
repeated
.
``
I
am
no
blower
and
boaster
like
some
that
I
could
*NL*
name
.
Come
on
!
''
And
drawing
my
sword
,
I
fell
on
guard
as
Alan
himself
*NL*
had
taught
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
David
!
''
he
cried
.
``
Are
ye
daft
?
I
cannae
draw
upon
ye
,
David
.
It
's
*NL*
fair
murder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
your
look-out
when
you
insulted
me
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
the
truth
!
''
cried
Alan
,
and
he
stood
for
a
moment
,
wringing
his
*NL*
mouth
in
his
hand
like
a
man
in
sore
perplexity
.
``
It
's
the
bare
truth
,
''
*NL*
he
said
,
and
drew
his
sword
.
But
before
I
could
touch
his
blade
with
*NL*
mine
,
he
had
thrown
it
from
him
and
fallen
to
the
ground
.
``
Na
,
na
,
''
he
*NL*
kept
saying
,
``
na
,
na
--
I
cannae
,
I
cannae
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
the
last
of
my
anger
oozed
all
out
of
me
;
and
I
found
myself
*NL*
only
sick
,
and
sorry
,
and
blank
,
and
wondering
at
myself
.
I
would
have
*NL*
given
the
world
to
take
back
what
I
had
said
;
but
a
word
once
spoken
,
*NL*
who
can
recapture
it
?
I
minded
me
of
all
Alan
's
kindness
and
courage
in
*NL*
the
past
,
how
he
had
helped
and
cheered
and
borne
with
me
in
our
evil
*NL*
days
;
and
then
recalled
my
own
insults
,
and
saw
that
I
had
lost
for
ever
*NL*
that
doughty
friend
.
At
the
same
time
,
the
sickness
that
hung
upon
*NL*
me
seemed
to
redouble
,
and
the
pang
in
my
side
was
like
a
sword
for
*NL*
sharpness
.
I
thought
I
must
have
swooned
where
I
stood
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
it
was
that
gave
me
a
thought
.
No
apology
could
blot
out
what
I
had
*NL*
said
;
it
was
needless
to
think
of
one
,
none
could
cover
the
offence
;
but
*NL*
where
an
apology
was
vain
,
a
mere
cry
for
help
might
bring
Alan
back
to
*NL*
my
side
.
I
put
my
pride
away
from
me
.
``
Alan
!
''
I
said
;
``
if
ye
cannae
help
*NL*
me
,
I
must
just
die
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
started
up
sitting
,
and
looked
at
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
true
,
''
said
I.
``
I
'm
by
with
it
.
O
,
let
me
get
into
the
bield
of
a
*NL*
house
--
I
'll
can
die
there
easier
.
''
I
had
no
need
to
pretend
;
whether
I
*NL*
chose
or
not
,
I
spoke
in
a
weeping
voice
that
would
have
melted
a
heart
*NL*
of
stone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
ye
walk
?
''
asked
Alan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
I
,
``
not
without
help
.
This
last
hour
my
legs
have
been
*NL*
fainting
under
me
;
I
've
a
stitch
in
my
side
like
a
red-hot
iron
;
I
*NL*
cannae
breathe
right
.
If
I
die
,
ye
'll
can
forgive
me
,
Alan
?
In
my
heart
,
*NL*
I
liked
ye
fine
--
even
when
I
was
the
angriest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wheesht
,
wheesht
!
''
cried
Alan
.
``
Dinna
say
that
!
David
man
,
ye
ken
--
''
He
*NL*
shut
his
mouth
upon
a
sob
.
``
Let
me
get
my
arm
about
ye
,
''
he
continued
;
*NL*
``
that
's
the
way
!
Now
lean
upon
me
hard
.
Gude
kens
where
there
's

too

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay

''
said
I
,
``
I
can
be
doing
this
way
;
''
and
I
pressed
his
arm
with
my
*NL*
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
he
came
near
sobbing
.
``
Davie
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
'm
no
a
right
man
at

*NL*
*NL*
``
O

say
no

said
I.
``
We

O
,

Is

nae

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
find
a
house
to
ye

David

he
said
,
stoutly
.
``
We
'll
follow
down

the
burn

*NL*
*NL*
``
O

Alan

says
I
,
``
and
me
a
good
twelve
inches
taller
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye
're
no
such
a
thing

cried
Alan
,
with
a
start
.
``
There
may
be
a
*NL*
trifling
matter

an
inch

two

I
'm
no

exactly
what
*NL*
ye
would
call

tall
man

whatever

and
I
dare

he
added
,
his
voice
*NL*
tailing
off
in
a
laughable
manner
,
``
now

I
come
to

*NL*
*NL*
It
was
sweet
and
laughable
to
hear
Alan
eat
his
words
up
in
the
fear
of
*NL*
some
fresh
quarrel
.
I
could
have
laughed
,
had
not
my
stitch
caught
me
so
*NL*
hard
;
but
if
I
had
laughed

I
think
I
must
have
wept
too

*NL*
*NL*
``
Alan

cried
I
,
``
what
makes

good
to

What
makes

such
a
thankless
fellow

*NL*

`
Deed
,

I
do
n't
know

said
Alan
.
``
For
just
precisely
what
I

I

CHAPTER
XXV
*NL*
*NL*
IN
BALQUHIDDER
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
door
of
the
first
house
we
came
to
,
Alan
knocked
,
which
was
of
*NL*
no
very
safe
enterprise
in
such
a
part
of
the
Highlands
as
the
Braes
of
*NL*
Balquhidder
.
No
great
clan
held
rule
there
;
it
was
filled
and
disputed
*NL*
by
small
septs
,
and
broken
remnants
,
and
what
they
call
``
chiefless
*NL*
folk
,
''
driven
into
the
wild
country
about
the
springs
of
Forth
and
Teith
*NL*
by
the
advance
of
the
Campbells
.
Here
were
Stewarts
and
Maclarens
,
which
*NL*
came
to
the
same
thing
,
for
the
Maclarens
followed
Alan
's
chief
in
war
,
*NL*
and
made
but
one
clan
with
Appin
.
Here
,
too
,
were
many
of
that
old
,
*NL*
proscribed
,
nameless
,
red-handed
clan
of
the
Macgregors
.
They
had
always
*NL*
been
ill-considered
,
and
now
worse
than
ever
,
having
credit
with
no
side
*NL*
or
party
in
the
whole
country
of
Scotland
.
Their
chief
,
Macgregor
of
*NL*
Macgregor
,
was
in
exile
;
the
more
immediate
leader
of
that
part
of
them
*NL*
about
Balquhidder
,
James
More
,
Rob
Roy
's
eldest
son
,
lay
waiting
his
*NL*
trial
in
Edinburgh
Castle
;
they
were
in
ill-blood
with
Highlander
and
*NL*
Lowlander
,
with
the
Grahames
,
the
Maclarens
,
and
the
Stewarts
;
and
Alan
,
*NL*
who
took
up
the
quarrel
of
any
friend
,
however
distant
,
was
extremely
*NL*
wishful
to
avoid
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Chance
served
us
very
well
;
for
it
was
a
household
of
Maclarens
that
we
*NL*
found
,
where
Alan
was
not
only
welcome
for
his
name
's
sake
but
known
*NL*
by
reputation
.
Here
then
I
was
got
to
bed
without
delay
,
and
a
doctor
*NL*
fetched
,
who
found
me
in
a
sorry
plight
.
But
whether
because
he
was
a
*NL*
very
good
doctor
,
or
I
a
very
young
,
strong
man
,
I
lay
bedridden
for
no
*NL*
more
than
a
week
,
and
before
a
month
I
was
able
to
take
the
road
again
*NL*
with
a
good
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
time
Alan
would
not
leave
me
though
I
often
pressed
him
,
and
*NL*
indeed
his
foolhardiness
in
staying
was
a
common
subject
of
outcry
with
*NL*
the
two
or
three
friends
that
were
let
into
the
secret
.
He
hid
by
day
*NL*
in
a
hole
of
the
braes
under
a
little
wood
;
and
at
night
,
when
the
coast
*NL*
was
clear
,
would
come
into
the
house
to
visit
me
.
I
need
not
say
if
I
*NL*
was
pleased
to
see
him
;
Mrs.
Maclaren
,
our
hostess
,
thought
nothing
good
*NL*
enough
for
such
a
guest
;
and
as
Duncan
Dhu
-LRB-
which
was
the
name
of
our
*NL*
host
-RRB-
had
a
pair
of
pipes
in
his
house
,
and
was
much
of
a
lover
of
*NL*
music
,
this
time
of
my
recovery
was
quite
a
festival
,
and
we
commonly
*NL*
turned
night
into
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
soldiers
let
us
be
;
although
once
a
party
of
two
companies
and
some
*NL*
dragoons
went
by
in
the
bottom
of
the
valley
,
where
I
could
see
them
*NL*
through
the
window
as
I
lay
in
bed
.
What
was
much
more
astonishing
,
no
*NL*
magistrate
came
near
me
,
and
there
was
no
question
put
of
whence
I
came
*NL*
or
whither
I
was
going
;
and
in
that
time
of
excitement
,
I
was
as
free
of
*NL*
all
inquiry
as
though
I
had
lain
in
a
desert
.
Yet
my
presence
was
known
*NL*
before
I
left
to
all
the
people
in
Balquhidder
and
the
adjacent
parts
;
*NL*
many
coming
about
the
house
on
visits
and
these
-LRB-
after
the
custom
of
the
*NL*
country
-RRB-
spreading
the
news
among
their
neighbours
.
The
bills
,
too
,
had
*NL*
now
been
printed
.
There
was
one
pinned
near
the
foot
of
my
bed
,
where
*NL*
I
could
read
my
own
not
very
flattering
portrait
and
,
in
larger
*NL*
characters
,
the
amount
of
the
blood
money
that
had
been
set
upon
my
*NL*
life
.
Duncan
Dhu
and
the
rest
that
knew
that
I
had
come
there
in
Alan
's
*NL*
company
,
could
have
entertained
no
doubt
of
who
I
was
;
and
many
others
*NL*
must
have
had
their
guess
.
For
though
I
had
changed
my
clothes
,
I
could
*NL*
not
change
my
age
or
person
;
and
Lowland
boys
of
eighteen
were
not
so
*NL*
rife
in
these
parts
of
the
world
,
and
above
all
about
that
time
,
that
*NL*
they
could
fail
to
put
one
thing
with
another
,
and
connect
me
with
the
*NL*
bill
.
So
it
was
,
at
least
.
Other
folk
keep
a
secret
among
two
or
three
*NL*
near
friends
,
and
somehow
it
leaks
out
;
but
among
these
clansmen
,
it
is
*NL*
told
to
a
whole
countryside
,
and
they
will
keep
it
for
a
century
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
but
one
thing
happened
worth
narrating
;
and
that
is
the
visit
*NL*
I
had
of
Robin
Oig
,
one
of
the
sons
of
the
notorious
Rob
Roy
.
He
was
*NL*
sought
upon
all
sides
on
a
charge
of
carrying
a
young
woman
from
*NL*
Balfron
and
marrying
her
-LRB-
as
was
alleged
-RRB-
by
force
;
yet
he
stepped
about
*NL*
Balquhidder
like
a
gentleman
in
his
own
walled
policy
.
It
was
he
who
had
*NL*
shot
James
Maclaren
at
the
plough
stilts
,
a
quarrel
never
satisfied
;
yet
*NL*
he
walked
into
the
house
of
his
blood
enemies
as
a
rider
*
might
into
a
*NL*
public
inn
.
*
Commercial
traveller
.
*NL*
*NL*
Duncan
had
time
to
pass
me
word
of
who
it
was
;
and
we
looked
at
one
*NL*
another
in
concern
.
You
should
understand
,
it
was
then
close
upon
the
*NL*
time
of
Alan
's
coming
;
the
two
were
little
likely
to
agree
;
and
yet
if
*NL*
we
sent
word
or
sought
to
make
a
signal
,
it
was
sure
to
arouse
suspicion
*NL*
in
a
man
under
so
dark
a
cloud
as
the
Macgregor
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
in
with
a
great
show
of
civility
,
but
like
a
man
among
*NL*
inferiors
;
took
off
his
bonnet
to
Mrs.
Maclaren
,
but
clapped
it
on
his
*NL*
head
again
to
speak
to
Duncan
;
and
having
thus
set
himself
-LRB-
as
he
would
*NL*
have
thought
-RRB-
in
a
proper
light
,
came
to
my
bedside
and
bowed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
given
to
know
,
sir
,
''
says
he
,
``
that
your
name
is
Balfour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
call
me
David
Balfour
,
''
said
I
,
``
at
your
service
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
give
ye
my
name
in
return
,
sir
,
''
he
replied
,
``
but
it
's
one
*NL*
somewhat
blown
upon
of
late
days
;
and
it
'll
perhaps
suffice
if
I
tell
*NL*
ye
that
I
am
own
brother
to
James
More
Drummond
or
Macgregor
,
of
whom
ye
*NL*
will
scarce
have
failed
to
hear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
''
said
I
,
a
little
alarmed
;
``
nor
yet
of
your
father
,
*NL*
Macgregor-Campbell
.
''
And
I
sat
up
and
bowed
in
bed
;
for
I
thought
best
*NL*
to
compliment
him
,
in
case
he
was
proud
of
having
had
an
outlaw
to
his
*NL*
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
bowed
in
return
.
``
But
what
I
am
come
to
say
,
sir
,
''
he
went
on
,
``
is
*NL*
this
.
In
the
year
'
45
,
my
brother
raised
a
part
of
the
`
Gregara
'
and
*NL*
marched
six
companies
to
strike
a
stroke
for
the
good
side
;
and
the
*NL*
surgeon
that
marched
with
our
clan
and
cured
my
brother
's
leg
when
it
*NL*
was
broken
in
the
brush
at
Preston
Pans
,
was
a
gentleman
of
the
same
*NL*
name
precisely
as
yourself
.
He
was
brother
to
Balfour
of
Baith
;
and
if
*NL*
you
are
in
any
reasonable
degree
of
nearness
one
of
that
gentleman
's
*NL*
kin
,
I
have
come
to
put
myself
and
my
people
at
your
command
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
You
are
to
remember
that
I
knew
no
more
of
my
descent
than
any
cadger
's
*NL*
dog
;
my
uncle
,
to
be
sure
,
had
prated
of
some
of
our
high
connections
,
*NL*
but
nothing
to
the
present
purpose
;
and
there
was
nothing
left
me
but
*NL*
that
bitter
disgrace
of
owning
that
I
could
not
tell
.
*NL*
*NL*
Robin
told
me
shortly
he
was
sorry
he
had
put
himself
about
,
turned
his
*NL*
back
upon
me
without
a
sign
of
salutation
,
and
as
he
went
towards
the
*NL*
door
,
I
could
hear
him
telling
Duncan
that
I
was
``
only
some
kinless
loon
*NL*
that
did
n't
know
his
own
father
.
''
Angry
as
I
was
at
these
words
,
and
*NL*
ashamed
of
my
own
ignorance
,
I
could
scarce
keep
from
smiling
that
a
*NL*
man
who
was
under
the
lash
of
the
law
-LRB-
and
was
indeed
hanged
some
three
*NL*
years
later
-RRB-
should
be
so
nice
as
to
the
descent
of
his
acquaintances
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
in
the
door
,
he
met
Alan
coming
in
;
and
the
two
drew
back
and
*NL*
looked
at
each
other
like
strange
dogs
.
They
were
neither
of
them
big
*NL*
men
,
but
they
seemed
fairly
to
swell
out
with
pride
.
Each
wore
a
sword
,
*NL*
and
by
a
movement
of
his
haunch
,
thrust
clear
the
hilt
of
it
,
so
that
it
*NL*
might
be
the
more
readily
grasped
and
the
blade
drawn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Stewart
,
I
am
thinking
,
''
says
Robin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Troth
,
Mr.
Macgregor
,
it
's
not
a
name
to
be
ashamed
of

''
answered
Alan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
know
ye
were
in
my
country
,

,
''
says
Robin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
sticks
in
my

Maclarens

says
Alan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
kittle
point

returned
the
other
.
``
There
may
be
two
words
to

say
to
that

But
I
think
I
will
have
heard

a
man
of
your

*NL*
*NL*
``
Unless
ye
were

deaf

more
than

says
Alan
.
``
I
am
not
the
only
man

had
a
talk
with
a

not

many
years
back

I

of

*NL*
``
Do

says
Robin

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

I
wouldnae
wonder

said
Alan
.
``
The
gentleman
I
have
in
my

had
the
ill-taste
to
clap
Campbell

*NL*
``
My

Robin

*NL*
``
The

unequal

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
thinking
that

said
Alan
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
half
out
of
bed
,
and
Duncan
had
been
hanging
at
the
elbow
of
these
*NL*
fighting
cocks
,
ready
to
intervene
upon
the
least
occasion
.
But
when
*NL*
that
word
was
uttered
,
it
was
a
case
of
now
or
never
;
and
Duncan
,
with
*NL*
something
of
a
white
face
to
be
sure
,
thrust
himself
between
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen

''
said
he
,
``
I
will
have
been
thinking
of
a
very
different

Here
are
my
pipes

here
are
you
two
gentlemen

are
baith
acclaimed

an
auld
dispute

one

best

Here
will
be
a
braw
chance
to
settle
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

said
Alan
,
still
addressing
Robin
,
from
whom
indeed
he
had
*NL*
not
so
much
as
shifted
his
eyes
,
nor
yet
Robin
from
him
,
``
why
,
sir

*NL*
says
Alan
,
``
I
think
I
will
have
heard

music

Are
ye
a
bit
of
a
piper

*NL*
*NL*

Rumour
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
pipe
like
a
Macrimmon
!

cries
Robin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
is
a
very
bold
word
,
''
quoth
Alan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
made
bolder
words
good
before
now

''
returned
Robin
,
``
and
that
*NL*
against
better
adversaries
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
easy
to
try
that
,
''
says
Alan
.
*NL*
*NL*
Duncan
Dhu
made
haste
to
bring
out
the
pair
of
pipes
that
was
his
*NL*
principal
possession
,
and
to
set
before
his
guests
a
mutton-ham
and
a
*NL*
bottle
of
that
drink
which
they
call
Athole
brose
,
and
which
is
made
of
*NL*
old
whiskey
,
strained
honey
and
sweet
cream
,
slowly
beaten
together
in
*NL*
the
right
order
and
proportion
.
The
two
enemies
were
still
on
the
very
*NL*
breach
of
a
quarrel
;
but
down
they
sat
,
one
upon
each
side
of
the
peat
*NL*
fire
,
with
a
mighty
show
of
politeness
.
Maclaren
pressed
them
to
taste
*NL*
his
mutton-ham
and
``
the
wife
's
brose
,
''
reminding
them
the
wife
was
out
*NL*
of
Athole
and
had
a
name
far
and
wide
for
her
skill
in
that
confection
.
*NL*
But
Robin
put
aside
these
hospitalities
as
bad
for
the
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
have
ye
to
remark
,
sir
,
''
said
Alan
,
``
that
I
havenae
broken
*NL*
bread
for
near
upon
ten
hours
,
which
will
be
worse
for
the
breath
than
*NL*
any
brose
in
Scotland
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
take
no
advantages
,
Mr.
Stewart

replied
Robin
.
``
Eat
and
drink
;
*NL*
I
'll
follow
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Each
ate
a
small
portion
of
the
ham
and
drank
a
glass
of
the
brose
to
*NL*
Mrs.
Maclaren
;
and
then
after
a
great
number
of
civilities
,
Robin
took
*NL*
the
pipes
and
played
a
little
spring
in
a
very
ranting
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
ye
can
blow
''
said
Alan
;
and
taking
the
instrument
from
his
rival
,
*NL*
he
first
played
the
same
spring
in
a
manner
identical
with
Robin
's
;
and
*NL*
then
wandered
into
variations
,
which
,
as
he
went
on
,
he
decorated
with
*NL*
a
perfect
flight
of
grace-notes
,
such
as
pipers
love
,
and
call
the
*NL*
``
warblers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
been
pleased
with
Robin
's
playing
,
Alan
's
ravished
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
no
very
bad
,
Mr.
Stewart
,
''
said
the
rival
,
``
but
ye
show
a
poor
*NL*
device
in
your
warblers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Me
!
''
cried
Alan
,
the
blood
starting
to
his
face
.
``
I
give
ye
the
lie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
ye
own
yourself
beaten
at
the
pipes
,
then
,
''
said
Robin
,
``
that
ye
*NL*
seek
to
change
them
for
the
sword
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
's
very
well
said
,
Mr.
Macgregor
,
''
returned
Alan
;
``
and
in
the
*NL*
meantime
''
-LRB-
laying
a
strong
accent
on
the
word
-RRB-
``
I
take
back
the
lie
.
I
*NL*
appeal
to
Duncan
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
ye
need
appeal
to
naebody
,
''
said
Robin
.
``
Ye
're
a
far
better
*NL*
judge
than
any
Maclaren
in
Balquhidder
:
for
it
's
a
God
's
truth
that
*NL*
you
're
a
very
creditable
piper
for
a
Stewart
.
Hand
me
the
pipes
.
''
Alan
*NL*
did
as
he
asked
;
and
Robin
proceeded
to
imitate
and
correct
some
part
of
*NL*
Alan
's
variations
,
which
it
seemed
that
he
remembered
perfectly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
ye
have
music
,
''
said
Alan
,
gloomily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
be
the
judge
yourself
,
Mr.
Stewart
,
''
said
Robin
;
and
taking
up
*NL*
the
variations
from
the
beginning
,
he
worked
them
throughout
to
so
new
a
*NL*
purpose
,
with
such
ingenuity
and
sentiment
,
and
with
so
odd
a
fancy
and
*NL*
so
quick
a
knack
in
the
grace-notes
,
that
I
was
amazed
to
hear
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Alan
,
his
face
grew
dark
and
hot
,
and
he
sat
and
gnawed
his
*NL*
fingers
,
like
a
man
under
some
deep
affront
.
``
Enough
!
''
he
cried
.
``
Ye
can
*NL*
blow
the
pipes
--
make
the
most
of
that
.
''
And
he
made
as
if
to
rise
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Robin
only
held
out
his
hand
as
if
to
ask
for
silence
,
and
struck
*NL*
into
the
slow
measure
of
a
pibroch
.
It
was
a
fine
piece
of
music
in
*NL*
itself
,
and
nobly
played
;
but
it
seems
,
besides
,
it
was
a
piece
peculiar
*NL*
to
the
Appin
Stewarts
and
a
chief
favourite
with
Alan
.
The
first
notes
*NL*
were
scarce
out
,
before
there
came
a
change
in
his
face
;
when
the
time
*NL*
quickened
,
he
seemed
to
grow
restless
in
his
seat
;
and
long
before
that
*NL*
piece
was
at
an
end
,
the
last
signs
of
his
anger
died
from
him
,
and
he
*NL*
had
no
thought
but
for
the
music
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Robin
Oig
,
''
he
said
,
when
it
was
done
,
``
ye
are
a
great
piper
.
I
am
not
*NL*
fit
to
blow
in
the
same
kingdom
with
ye
.
Body
of
me
!
ye
have
mair
music
*NL*
in
your
sporran
than
I
have
in
my
head
!
And
though
it
still
sticks
in
*NL*
my
mind
that
I
could
maybe
show
ye
another
of
it
with
the
cold
steel
,
*NL*
I
warn
ye
beforehand
--
it
'll
no
be
fair
!
It
would
go
against
my
heart
to
*NL*
haggle
a
man
that
can
blow
the
pipes
as
you
can
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thereupon
that
quarrel
was
made
up
;
all
night
long
the
brose
was
going
*NL*
and
the
pipes
changing
hands
;
and
the
day
had
come
pretty
bright
,
and
*NL*
the
three
men
were
none
the
better
for
what
they
had
been
taking
,
before
*NL*
Robin
as
much
as
thought
upon
the
road
.

CHAPTER
XXVI
*NL*
*NL*
END
OF
THE
FLIGHT
:
WE
PASS
THE
FORTH
*NL*
*NL*
The
month
,
as
I
have
said
,
was
not
yet
out
,
but
it
was
already
far
*NL*
through
August
,
and
beautiful
warm
weather
,
with
every
sign
of
an
early
*NL*
and
great
harvest
,
when
I
was
pronounced
able
for
my
journey
.
Our
money
*NL*
was
now
run
to
so
low
an
ebb
that
we
must
think
first
of
all
on
speed
;
*NL*
for
if
we
came
not
soon
to
Mr.
Rankeillor
's
,
or
if
when
we
came
there
he
*NL*
should
fail
to
help
me
,
we
must
surely
starve
.
In
Alan
's
view
,
besides
,
*NL*
the
hunt
must
have
now
greatly
slackened
;
and
the
line
of
the
Forth
and
*NL*
even
Stirling
Bridge
,
which
is
the
main
pass
over
that
river
,
would
be
*NL*
watched
with
little
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
chief
principle
in
military
affairs
,
''
said
he
,
``
to
go
where
*NL*
ye
are
least
expected
.
Forth
is
our
trouble
;
ye
ken
the
saying
,
`
Forth
*NL*
bridles
the
wild
Hielandman
.
'
Well
,
if
we
seek
to
creep
round
about
*NL*
the
head
of
that
river
and
come
down
by
Kippen
or
Balfron
,
it
's
just
*NL*
precisely
there
that
they
'll
be
looking
to
lay
hands
on
us
.
But
if
we
*NL*
stave
on
straight
to
the
auld
Brig
of
Stirling
,
I
'll
lay
my
sword
they
*NL*
let
us
pass
unchallenged
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
night
,
accordingly
,
we
pushed
to
the
house
of
a
Maclaren
in
*NL*
Strathire
,
a
friend
of
Duncan
's
,
where
we
slept
the
twenty-first
of
the
*NL*
month
,
and
whence
we
set
forth
again
about
the
fall
of
night
to
make
*NL*
another
easy
stage
.
The
twenty-second
we
lay
in
a
heather
bush
on
the
*NL*
hillside
in
Uam
Var
,
within
view
of
a
herd
of
deer
,
the
happiest
ten
*NL*
hours
of
sleep
in
a
fine
,
breathing
sunshine
and
on
bone-dry
ground
,
*NL*
that
I
have
ever
tasted
.
That
night
we
struck
Allan
Water
,
and
followed
*NL*
it
down
;
and
coming
to
the
edge
of
the
hills
saw
the
whole
Carse
of
*NL*
Stirling
underfoot
,
as
flat
as
a
pancake
,
with
the
town
and
castle
on
a
*NL*
hill
in
the
midst
of
it
,
and
the
moon
shining
on
the
Links
of
Forth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
Alan
,
``
I
kenna
if
ye
care
,
but
ye
're
in
your
own
land
again
.
*NL*
We
passed
the
Hieland
Line
in
the
first
hour
;
and
now
if
we
could
but
*NL*
pass
yon
crooked
water
,
we
might
cast
our
bonnets
in
the
air
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
Allan
Water
,
near
by
where
it
falls
into
the
Forth
,
we
found
a
little
*NL*
sandy
islet
,
overgrown
with
burdock
,
butterbur
and
the
like
low
plants
,
*NL*
that
would
just
cover
us
if
we
lay
flat
.
Here
it
was
we
made
our
camp
,
*NL*
within
plain
view
of
Stirling
Castle
,
whence
we
could
hear
the
drums
*NL*
beat
as
some
part
of
the
garrison
paraded
.
Shearers
worked
all
day
in
*NL*
a
field
on
one
side
of
the
river
,
and
we
could
hear
the
stones
going
*NL*
on
the
hooks
and
the
voices
and
even
the
words
of
the
men
talking
.
It
*NL*
behoved
to
lie
close
and
keep
silent
.
But
the
sand
of
the
little
isle
*NL*
was
sun-warm
,
the
green
plants
gave
us
shelter
for
our
heads
,
we
had
*NL*
food
and
drink
in
plenty
;
and
to
crown
all
,
we
were
within
sight
of
*NL*
safety
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
the
shearers
quit
their
work
and
the
dusk
began
to
fall
,
*NL*
we
waded
ashore
and
struck
for
the
Bridge
of
Stirling
,
keeping
to
the
*NL*
fields
and
under
the
field
fences
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bridge
is
close
under
the
castle
hill
,
an
old
,
high
,
narrow
bridge
*NL*
with
pinnacles
along
the
parapet
;
and
you
may
conceive
with
how
much
*NL*
interest
I
looked
upon
it
,
not
only
as
a
place
famous
in
history
,
but
as
*NL*
the
very
doors
of
salvation
to
Alan
and
myself
.
The
moon
was
not
yet
up
*NL*
when
we
came
there
;
a
few
lights
shone
along
the
front
of
the
fortress
,
*NL*
and
lower
down
a
few
lighted
windows
in
the
town
;
but
it
was
all
mighty
*NL*
still
,
and
there
seemed
to
be
no
guard
upon
the
passage
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
for
pushing
straight
across
;
but
Alan
was
more
wary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
looks
unco
'
quiet
,
''
said
he
;
``
but
for
all
that
we
'll
lie
down
here
*NL*
cannily
behind
a
dyke
,
and
make
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
we
lay
for
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
whiles
whispering
,
whiles
*NL*
lying
still
and
hearing
nothing
earthly
but
the
washing
of
the
water
on
*NL*
the
piers
.
At
last
there
came
by
an
old
,
hobbling
woman
with
a
crutch
*NL*
stick
;
who
first
stopped
a
little
,
close
to
where
we
lay
,
and
bemoaned
*NL*
herself
and
the
long
way
she
had
travelled
;
and
then
set
forth
again
up
*NL*
the
steep
spring
of
the
bridge
.
The
woman
was
so
little
,
and
the
night
*NL*
still
so
dark
,
that
we
soon
lost
sight
of
her
;
only
heard
the
sound
of
*NL*
her
steps
,
and
her
stick
,
and
a
cough
that
she
had
by
fits
,
draw
slowly
*NL*
farther
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
bound
to
be
across
now
,
''
I
whispered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Na
,
''
said
Alan
,
``
her
foot
still
sounds
boss
*
upon
the
bridge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*
Hollow
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
just
then
--
``
Who
goes
?
''
cried
a
voice
,
and
we
heard
the
butt
of
*NL*
a
musket
rattle
on
the
stones
.
I
must
suppose
the
sentry
had
been
*NL*
sleeping
,
so
that
had
we
tried
,
we
might
have
passed
unseen
;
but
he
was
*NL*
awake
now
,
and
the
chance
forfeited
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
'll
never
do
,
''
said
Alan
.
``
This
'll
never
,
never
do
for
us
,
David
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
without
another
word
,
he
began
to
crawl
away
through
the
fields
;
and
*NL*
a
little
after
,
being
well
out
of
eye-shot
,
got
to
his
feet
again
,
and
*NL*
struck
along
a
road
that
led
to
the
eastward
.
I
could
not
conceive
what
*NL*
he
was
doing
;
and
indeed
I
was
so
sharply
cut
by
the
disappointment
,
*NL*
that
I
was
little
likely
to
be
pleased
with
anything
.
A
moment
back
*NL*
and
I
had
seen
myself
knocking
at
Mr.
Rankeillor
's
door
to
claim
my
*NL*
inheritance
,
like
a
hero
in
a
ballad
;
and
here
was
I
back
again
,
a
*NL*
wandering
,
hunted
blackguard
,
on
the
wrong
side
of
Forth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Alan
,
``
what
would
ye
have
?
They
're
none
such
fools
as
I
*NL*
took
them
for
.
We
have
still
the
Forth
to
pass
,
Davie
--
weary
fall
the
*NL*
rains
that
fed
and
the
hillsides
that
guided
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
go
east
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ou
,
just
upon
the
chance
!
''
said
he
.
``
If
we
cannae
pass
the
river
,
we
'll
*NL*
have
to
see
what
we
can
do
for
the
firth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
fords
upon
the
river
,
and
none
upon
the
firth
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
there
are
fords
,
and
a
bridge
forbye
,
''
quoth
Alan
;
``
and
of
*NL*
what
service
,
when
they
are
watched
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
I
,
``
but
a
river
can
be
swum
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
them
that
have
the
skill
of
it
,
''
returned
he
;
``
but
I
have
yet
to
*NL*
hear
that
either
you
or
me
is
much
of
a
hand
at
that
exercise
;
and
for
*NL*
my
own
part
,
I
swim
like
a
stone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
up
to
you
in
talking
back
,
Alan
,
''
I
said
;
``
but
I
can
see
we
're
*NL*
making
bad
worse
.
If
it
's
hard
to
pass
a
river
,
it
stands
to
reason
it
*NL*
must
be
worse
to
pass
a
sea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
there
's
such
a
thing
as
a
boat

says
Alan
,
``
or
I
'm
the
more
*NL*
deceived
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
and
such
a
thing
as
money
,
''
says
I.
``
But
for
us
that
have
neither
*NL*
one
nor
other

they
might
just
as
well
not
have
been
invented

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye
think
so
?

said
Alan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
that
,

said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
David
,
''
says
he
,
``
ye
're
a
man
of
small
invention
and
less
faith

But
*NL*
let
me
set
my
wits
upon
the
hone
,
and
if
I
cannae
beg
,
borrow
,
nor
yet
*NL*
steal
a
boat
,
I
'll
make
one
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
see
ye
!
''
said
I.
``
And
what
's
more
than
all
that
:
if
ye
pass
a
*NL*
bridge
,
it
can
tell
no
tales
;
but
if
we
pass
the
firth
,
there
's
the
boat
*NL*
on
the
wrong
side
--
somebody
must
have
brought
it

the
country-side

*NL*
all
be

*NL*
*NL*
``

cried
Alan
,
``
if
I
make

deave
me
with
no
more
of
your
nonsense
,
but
walk
-LRB-
for
that
's
*NL*
what
you
've
got
to
do
-RRB-
--
and
let
Alan
think
for
ye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
night
,
then
,
we
walked
through
the
north
side
of
the
Carse
under
*NL*
the
high
line
of
the
Ochil
mountains
;
and
by
Alloa
and
Clackmannan
and
*NL*
Culross
,
all
of
which
we
avoided
:
and
about
ten
in
the
morning
,
mighty
*NL*
hungry
and
tired
,
came
to
the
little
clachan
of
Limekilns
.
This
is
a
*NL*
place
that
sits
near
in
by
the
water-side
,
and
looks
across
the
Hope
to
*NL*
the
town
of
the
Queensferry
.
Smoke
went
up
from
both
of
these
,
and
from
*NL*
other
villages
and
farms
upon
all
hands
.
The
fields
were
being
reaped
;
*NL*
two
ships
lay
anchored
,
and
boats
were
coming
and
going
on
the
Hope
.
*NL*
It
was
altogether
a
right
pleasant
sight
to
me
;
and
I
could
not
take
*NL*
my
fill
of
gazing
at
these
comfortable
,
green
,
cultivated
hills
and
the
*NL*
busy
people
both
of
the
field
and
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
all
that
,
there
was
Mr.
Rankeillor
's
house
on
the
south
shore
,
where
*NL*
I
had
no
doubt
wealth
awaited
me
;
and
here
was
I
upon
the
north
,
clad
in
*NL*
poor
enough
attire
of
an
outlandish
fashion
,
with
three
silver
shillings
*NL*
left
to
me
of
all
my
fortune
,
a
price
set
upon
my
head
,
and
an
outlawed
*NL*
man
for
my
sole
company
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
Alan
!
''
said
I
,
``
to
think
of
it
!
Over
there
,
there
's
all
that
heart
*NL*
could
want
waiting
me
;
and
the
birds
go
over
,
and
the
boats
go
over
--
all
*NL*
that
please
can
go
,
but
just
me
only
!
O
,
man
,
but
it
's
a
heart-break
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
Limekilns
we
entered
a
small
change-house
,
which
we
only
knew
to
be
a
*NL*
public
by
the
wand
over
the
door
,
and
bought
some
bread
and
cheese
from
*NL*
a
good-looking
lass
that
was
the
servant
.
This
we
carried
with
us
in
a
*NL*
bundle
,
meaning
to
sit
and
eat
it
in
a
bush
of
wood
on
the
sea-shore
,
*NL*
that
we
saw
some
third
part
of
a
mile
in
front
.
As
we
went
,
I
kept
*NL*
looking
across
the
water
and
sighing
to
myself
;
and
though
I
took
no
*NL*
heed
of
it
,
Alan
had
fallen
into
a
muse
.
At
last
he
stopped
in
the
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
ye
take
heed
of
the
lass
we
bought
this
of
?
''
says
he
,
tapping
on
*NL*
the
bread
and
cheese
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
,
''
said
I
,
``
and
a
bonny
lass
she
was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye
thought
that
?
''
cries
he
.
``
Man
,
David
,
that
's
good
news
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
name
of
all
that
's
wonderful
,
why
so
?
''
says
I.
``
What
good
can
*NL*
that
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Alan
,
with
one
of
his
droll
looks
,
``
I
was
rather
in
hopes
*NL*
it
would
maybe
get
us
that
boat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
were
the
other
way
about
,
it
would
be
liker
it
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
all
that
you
ken
,
ye
see
,
''
said
Alan
.
``
I
do
n't
want
the
lass
to
*NL*
fall
in
love
with
ye
,
I
want
her
to
be
sorry
for
ye
,
David
;
to
which
end
*NL*
there
is
no
manner
of
need
that
she
should
take
you
for
a
beauty
.
Let
me
*NL*
see
''
-LRB-
looking
me
curiously
over
-RRB-
.
``
I
wish
ye
were
a
wee
thing
paler
;
but
*NL*
apart
from
that
ye
'll
do
fine
for
my
purpose
--
ye
have
a
fine
,
hang-dog
,
*NL*
rag-and-tatter
,
clappermaclaw
kind
of
a
look
to
ye
,
as
if
ye
had
*NL*
stolen
the
coat
from
a
potato-bogle
.
Come
;
right
about
,
and
back
to
the
*NL*
change-house
for
that
boat
of
ours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
followed
him
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
David
Balfour
,
''
said
he
,
``
ye
're
a
very
funny
gentleman
by
your
way
of
*NL*
it
,
and
this
is
a
very
funny
employ
for
ye
,
no
doubt
.
For
all
that
,
if
*NL*
ye
have
any
affection
for
my
neck
-LRB-
to
say
nothing
of
your
own
-RRB-
ye
will
*NL*
perhaps
be
kind
enough
to
take
this
matter
responsibly
.
I
am
going
to
*NL*
do
a
bit
of
play-acting
,
the
bottom
ground
of
which
is
just
exactly
as
*NL*
serious
as
the
gallows
for
the
pair
of
us
.
So
bear
it
,
if
ye
please
,
in
*NL*
mind
,
and
conduct
yourself
according
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
''
said
I
,
``
have
it
as
you
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
got
near
the
clachan
,
he
made
me
take
his
arm
and
hang
upon
it
*NL*
like
one
almost
helpless
with
weariness
;
and
by
the
time
he
pushed
*NL*
open
the
change-house
door
,
he
seemed
to
be
half
carrying
me
.
The
maid
*NL*
appeared
surprised
-LRB-
as
well
she
might
be
-RRB-
at
our
speedy
return
;
but
*NL*
Alan
had
no
words
to
spare
for
her
in
explanation
,
helped
me
to
a
chair
,
*NL*
called
for
a
tass
of
brandy
with
which
he
fed
me
in
little
sips
,
*NL*
and
then
breaking
up
the
bread
and
cheese
helped
me
to
eat
it
like
*NL*
a
nursery-lass
;
the
whole
with
that
grave
,
concerned
,
affectionate
*NL*
countenance
,
that
might
have
imposed
upon
a
judge
.
It
was
small
wonder
*NL*
if
the
maid
were
taken
with
the
picture
we
presented
,
of
a
poor
,
sick
,
*NL*
overwrought
lad
and
his
most
tender
comrade
.
She
drew
quite
near
,
and
*NL*
stood
leaning
with
her
back
on
the
next
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
like
wrong
with
him
?
''
said
she
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alan
turned
upon
her
,
to
my
great
wonder
,
with
a
kind
of
fury
.
``
Wrong
?
''
*NL*
cries
he
.
``
He
's
walked
more
hundreds
of
miles
than
he
has
hairs
upon
his
*NL*
chin
,
and
slept
oftener
in
wet
heather
than
dry
sheets
.
Wrong
,
quo
'
she
!
*NL*
Wrong
enough
,
I
would
think
!
Wrong
,
indeed
!
''
and
he
kept
grumbling
to
*NL*
himself
as
he
fed
me
,
like
a
man
ill-pleased
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
young
for
the
like
of
that
,
''
said
the
maid
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ower
young
,
''
said
Alan
,
with
his
back
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
would
be
better
riding
,
''
says
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
where
could
I
get
a
horse
to
him
?
''
cried
Alan
,
turning
on
her
with
*NL*
the
same
appearance
of
fury
.
``
Would
ye
have
me
steal
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
this
roughness
would
have
sent
her
off
in
dudgeon
,
as
indeed
*NL*
it
closed
her
mouth
for
the
time
.
But
my
companion
knew
very
well
what
*NL*
he
was
doing
;
and
for
as
simple
as
he
was
in
some
things
of
life
,
had
a
*NL*
great
fund
of
roguishness
in
such
affairs
as
these
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye
neednae
tell
me
,
''
she
said
at
last
--
``
ye
're
gentry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Alan
,
softened
a
little
-LRB-
I
believe
against
his
will
-RRB-
by
*NL*
this
artless
comment
,
``
and
suppose
we
were
?
Did
ever
you
hear
that
*NL*
gentrice
put
money
in
folk
's
pockets
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
sighed
at
this
,
as
if
she
were
herself
some
disinherited
great
lady
.
*NL*
``
No
,
''
says
she
,
``
that
's
true
indeed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
all
this
while
chafing
at
the
part
I
played
,
and
sitting
*NL*
tongue-tied
between
shame
and
merriment
;
but
somehow
at
this
I
could
*NL*
hold
in
no
longer
,
and
bade
Alan
let
me
be
,
for
I
was
better
already
.
My
*NL*
voice
stuck
in
my
throat
,
for
I
ever
hated
to
take
part
in
lies
;
but
my
*NL*
very
embarrassment
helped
on
the
plot
,
for
the
lass
no
doubt
set
down
my
*NL*
husky
voice
to
sickness
and
fatigue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
he
nae
friends
?
''
said
she
,
in
a
tearful
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
has
he
so
!
''
cried
Alan
,
``
if
we
could
but
win
to
them
!
--
friends
and
*NL*
rich
friends
,
beds
to
lie
in
,
food
to
eat
,
doctors
to
see
to
him
--
and
*NL*
here
he
must
tramp
in
the
dubs
and
sleep
in
the
heather
like
a
*NL*
beggarman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
that
?
''
says
the
lass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
''
said
Alan
,
``
I
cannae
very
safely
say
;
but
I
'll
tell
ye
what
*NL*
I
'll
do
instead
,
''
says
he
,
``
I
'll
whistle
ye
a
bit
tune
.
''
And
with
that
*NL*
he
leaned
pretty
far
over
the
table
,
and
in
a
mere
breath
of
a
whistle
,
*NL*
but
with
a
wonderful
pretty
sentiment
,
gave
her
a
few
bars
of
``
Charlie
*NL*
is
my
darling
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wheesht
,
''
says
she
,
and
looked
over
her
shoulder
to
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
it
,
''
said
Alan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
him
so
young
!
''
cries
the
lass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
old
enough
to
--
''
and
Alan
struck
his
forefinger
on
the
back
part
*NL*
of
his
neck
,
meaning
that
I
was
old
enough
to
lose
my
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
a
black
shame
,
''
she
cried
,
flushing
high
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
what
will
be
,
though
,
''
said
Alan
,
``
unless
we
manage
the
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
the
lass
turned
and
ran
out
of
that
part
of
the
house
,
leaving
*NL*
us
alone
together
.
Alan
in
high
good
humour
at
the
furthering
of
his
*NL*
schemes
,
and
I
in
bitter
dudgeon
at
being
called
a
Jacobite
and
treated
*NL*
like
a
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alan
,
''
I
cried
,
``
I
can
stand
no
more
of
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye
'll
have
to
sit
it
then
,
Davie
,
''
said
he
.
``
For
if
ye
upset
the
pot
*NL*
now
,
ye
may
scrape
your
own
life
out
of
the
fire
,
but
Alan
Breck
is
a
*NL*
dead
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
so
true
that
I
could
only
groan
;
and
even
my
groan
served
*NL*
Alan
's
purpose
,
for
it
was
overheard
by
the
lass
as
she
came
flying
in
*NL*
again
with
a
dish
of
white
puddings
and
a
bottle
of
strong
ale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
lamb
!
''
says
she
,
and
had
no
sooner
set
the
meat
before
us
,
than
*NL*
she
touched
me
on
the
shoulder
with
a
little
friendly
touch
,
as
much
as
*NL*
to
bid
me
cheer
up
.
Then
she
told
us
to
fall
to
,
and
there
would
be
no
*NL*
more
to
pay
;
for
the
inn
was
her
own
,
or
at
least
her
father
's
,
and
he
*NL*
was
gone
for
the
day
to
Pittencrieff
.
We
waited
for
no
second
bidding
,
*NL*
for
bread
and
cheese
is
but
cold
comfort
and
the
puddings
smelt
*NL*
excellently
well
;
and
while
we
sat
and
ate
,
she
took
up
that
same
place
*NL*
by
the
next
table
,
looking
on
,
and
thinking
,
and
frowning
to
herself
,
*NL*
and
drawing
the
string
of
her
apron
through
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
thinking
ye
have
rather
a
long
tongue
,
''
she
said
at
last
to
Alan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
''
said
Alan
;
``
but
ye
see
I
ken
the
folk
I
speak
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
never
betray
ye
,
''
said
she
,
``
if
ye
mean
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
he
,
``
ye
're
not
that
kind
.
But
I
'll
tell
ye
what
ye
would
do
,
*NL*
ye
would
help
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
couldnae

''
said
she
,
shaking
her
head
.
``
Na
,
I
couldnae

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
he
,
``
but
if
ye
could
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
answered
him
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
,
my
lass
,
''
said
Alan
,
``
there
are
boats
in
the
Kingdom
of
*NL*
Fife
,
for
I
saw
two
-LRB-
no
less
-RRB-
upon
the
beach
,
as
I
came
in
by
your
*NL*
town
's
end
.
Now
if
we
could
have
the
use
of
a
boat
to
pass
under
cloud
*NL*
of
night
into
Lothian
,
and
some
secret
,
decent
kind
of
a
man
to
bring
*NL*
that
boat
back
again
and
keep
his
counsel
,
there
would
be
two
souls
*NL*
saved
--
mine
to
all
likelihood
--
his
to
a
dead
surety
.
If
we
lack
that
*NL*
boat
,
we
have
but
three
shillings
left
in
this
wide
world
;
and
where
*NL*
to
go
,
and
how
to
do
,
and
what
other
place
there
is
for
us
except
the
*NL*
chains
of
a
gibbet
--
I
give
you
my
naked
word

I
kenna

Shall
we
go
*NL*
wanting

lassie

Are
ye
to
lie
in
your
warm
bed
and
think
upon
us
,
when
*NL*
the
wind
gowls
in
the
chimney
and
the
rain
tirls
on
the
roof
?
Are
ye
to
*NL*
eat
your
meat
by
the
cheeks
of
a
red
fire
,
and
think
upon
this
poor
sick
*NL*
lad
of
mine
,
biting
his
finger
ends
on
a
blae
muir
for
cauld
and
hunger
?
*NL*
Sick
or
sound
,
he
must
aye
be
moving
;
with
the
death
grapple
at
his
*NL*
throat
he
must
aye
be
trailing
in
the
rain
on
the
lang
roads
;
and
when
*NL*
he
gants
his
last
on
a
rickle
of
cauld
stanes
,
there
will
be
nae
friends
*NL*
near
him
but
only
me
and
God
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
appeal
,
I
could
see
the
lass
was
in
great
trouble
of
mind
,
*NL*
being
tempted
to
help
us
,
and
yet
in
some
fear
she
might
be
helping
*NL*
malefactors
;
and
so
now
I
determined
to
step
in
myself
and
to
allay
her
*NL*
scruples
with
a
portion
of
the
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
ever
you
hear
,
''
said
I
,
``
of
Mr.
Rankeillor
of
the
Ferry
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rankeillor
the
writer
?
''
said
she
.
``
I
daur
say
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
I
,
``
it
's
to
his
door
that
I
am
bound
,
so
you
may
judge
by
*NL*
that
if
I
am
an
ill-doer
;
and
I
will
tell
you
more
,
that
though
I
am
*NL*
indeed
,
by
a
dreadful
error
,
in
some
peril
of
my
life
,
King
George
has
*NL*
no
truer
friend
in
all
Scotland
than
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
face
cleared
up
mightily
at
this
,
although
Alan
's
darkened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
more
than
I
would
ask
,
''
said
she
.
``
Mr.
Rankeillor
is
a
kennt
*NL*
man
.
''
And
she
bade
us
finish
our
meat
,
get
clear
of
the
clachan
as
soon
*NL*
as
might
be
,
and
lie
close
in
the
bit
wood
on
the
sea-beach
.
``
And
ye
can
*NL*
trust
me
,
''
says
she
,
``
I
'll
find
some
means
to
put
you
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
we
waited
for
no
more
,
but
shook
hands
with
her
upon
the
*NL*
bargain
,
made
short
work
of
the
puddings
,
and
set
forth
again
from
*NL*
Limekilns
as
far
as
to
the
wood
.
It
was
a
small
piece
of
perhaps
a
score
*NL*
of
elders
and
hawthorns
and
a
few
young
ashes
,
not
thick
enough
to
veil
*NL*
us
from
passersby
upon
the
road
or
beach
.
Here
we
must
lie
,
however
,
*NL*
making
the
best
of
the
brave
warm
weather
and
the
good
hopes
we
now
had
*NL*
of
a
deliverance
,
and
planing
more
particularly
what
remained
for
us
to
*NL*
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
but
one
trouble
all
day
;
when
a
strolling
piper
came
and
sat
in
*NL*
the
same
wood
with
us
;
a
red-nosed
,
bleareyed
,
drunken
dog
,
with
a
great
*NL*
bottle
of
whisky
in
his
pocket
,
and
a
long
story
of
wrongs
that
had
been
*NL*
done
him
by
all
sorts
of
persons
,
from
the
Lord
President
of
the
*NL*
Court
of
Session
,
who
had
denied
him
justice
,
down
to
the
Bailies
of
*NL*
Inverkeithing
who
had
given
him
more
of
it
than
he
desired
.
It
was
*NL*
impossible
but
he
should
conceive
some
suspicion
of
two
men
lying
all
*NL*
day
concealed
in
a
thicket
and
having
no
business
to
allege
.
As
long
as
*NL*
he
stayed
there
he
kept
us
in
hot
water
with
prying
questions
;
and
after
*NL*
he
was
gone
,
as
he
was
a
man
not
very
likely
to
hold
his
tongue
,
we
were
*NL*
in
the
greater
impatience
to
be
gone
ourselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
came
to
an
end
with
the
same
brightness
;
the
night
fell
quiet
*NL*
and
clear
;
lights
came
out
in
houses
and
hamlets
and
then
,
one
after
*NL*
another
,
began
to
be
put
out
;
but
it
was
past
eleven
,
and
we
were
long
*NL*
since
strangely
tortured
with
anxieties
,
before
we
heard
the
grinding
*NL*
of
oars
upon
the
rowing-pins
.
At
that
,
we
looked
out
and
saw
the
lass
*NL*
herself
coming
rowing
to
us
in
a
boat
.
She
had
trusted
no
one
with
our
*NL*
affairs
,
not
even
her
sweetheart
,
if
she
had
one
;
but
as
soon
as
her
*NL*
father
was
asleep
,
had
left
the
house
by
a
window
,
stolen
a
neighbour
's
*NL*
boat
,
and
come
to
our
assistance
single-handed
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
abashed
how
to
find
expression
for
my
thanks
;
but
she
was
no
less
*NL*
abashed
at
the
thought
of
hearing
them
;
begged
us
to
lose
no
time
and
to
*NL*
hold
our
peace
,
saying
-LRB-
very
properly
-RRB-
that
the
heart
of
our
matter
was
*NL*
in
haste
and
silence
;
and
so
,
what
with
one
thing
and
another
,
she
had
*NL*
set
us
on
the
Lothian
shore
not
far
from
Carriden
,
had
shaken
hands
with
*NL*
us
,
and
was
out
again
at
sea
and
rowing
for
Limekilns
,
before
there
was
*NL*
one
word
said
either
of
her
service
or
our
gratitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
after
she
was
gone
,
we
had
nothing
to
say
,
as
indeed
nothing
was
*NL*
enough
for
such
a
kindness
.
Only
Alan
stood
a
great
while
upon
the
shore
*NL*
shaking
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
very
fine
lass
,
''
he
said
at
last
.
``
David
,
it
is
a
very
fine
*NL*
lass
.
''
And
a
matter
of
an
hour
later
,
as
we
were
lying
in
a
den
on
*NL*
the
sea-shore
and
I
had
been
already
dozing
,
he
broke
out
again
in
*NL*
commendations
of
her
character
.
For
my
part
,
I
could
say
nothing
,
she
*NL*
was
so
simple
a
creature
that
my
heart
smote
me
both
with
remorse
and
*NL*
fear
:
remorse
because
we
had
traded
upon
her
ignorance
;
and
fear
lest
we
*NL*
should
have
anyway
involved
her
in
the
dangers
of
our
situation
.

CHAPTER
XXVII
*NL*
*NL*
I
COME
TO
MR.
RANKEILLOR
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
it
was
agreed
that
Alan
should
fend
for
himself
till
*NL*
sunset
;
but
as
soon
as
it
began
to
grow
dark
,
he
should
lie
in
the
*NL*
fields
by
the
roadside
near
to
Newhalls
,
and
stir
for
naught
until
he
*NL*
heard
me
whistling
.
At
first
I
proposed
I
should
give
him
for
a
signal
*NL*
the
``
Bonnie
House
of
Airlie
,
''
which
was
a
favourite
of
mine
;
but
he
*NL*
objected
that
as
the
piece
was
very
commonly
known
,
any
ploughman
might
*NL*
whistle
it
by
accident
;
and
taught
me
instead
a
little
fragment
of
a
*NL*
Highland
air
,
which
has
run
in
my
head
from
that
day
to
this
,
and
will
*NL*
likely
run
in
my
head
when
I
lie
dying
.
Every
time
it
comes
to
me
,
it
*NL*
takes
me
off
to
that
last
day
of
my
uncertainty
,
with
Alan
sitting
up
in
*NL*
the
bottom
of
the
den
,
whistling
and
beating
the
measure
with
a
finger
,
*NL*
and
the
grey
of
the
dawn
coming
on
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
in
the
long
street
of
Queensferry
before
the
sun
was
up
.
It
was
a
*NL*
fairly
built
burgh
,
the
houses
of
good
stone
,
many
slated
;
the
town-hall
*NL*
not
so
fine
,
I
thought
,
as
that
of
Peebles
,
nor
yet
the
street
so
noble
;
*NL*
but
take
it
altogether
,
it
put
me
to
shame
for
my
foul
tatters
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
morning
went
on
,
and
the
fires
began
to
be
kindled
,
and
the
*NL*
windows
to
open
,
and
the
people
to
appear
out
of
the
houses
,
my
concern
*NL*
and
despondency
grew
ever
the
blacker
.
I
saw
now
that
I
had
no
grounds
*NL*
to
stand
upon
;
and
no
clear
proof
of
my
rights
,
nor
so
much
as
of
my
own
*NL*
identity
.
If
it
was
all
a
bubble
,
I
was
indeed
sorely
cheated
and
left
*NL*
in
a
sore
pass
.
Even
if
things
were
as
I
conceived
,
it
would
in
all
*NL*
likelihood
take
time
to
establish
my
contentions
;
and
what
time
had
I
*NL*
to
spare
with
less
than
three
shillings
in
my
pocket
,
and
a
condemned
,
*NL*
hunted
man
upon
my
hands
to
ship
out
of
the
country
?
Truly
,
if
my
hope
*NL*
broke
with
me
,
it
might
come
to
the
gallows
yet
for
both
of
us
.
And
as
I
*NL*
continued
to
walk
up
and
down
,
and
saw
people
looking
askance
at
me
upon
*NL*
the
street
or
out
of
windows
,
and
nudging
or
speaking
one
to
another
*NL*
with
smiles
,
I
began
to
take
a
fresh
apprehension
:
that
it
might
be
no
*NL*
easy
matter
even
to
come
to
speech
of
the
lawyer
,
far
less
to
convince
*NL*
him
of
my
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
life
of
me
I
could
not
muster
up
the
courage
to
address
any
of
*NL*
these
reputable
burghers
;
I
thought
shame
even
to
speak
with
them
in
*NL*
such
a
pickle
of
rags
and
dirt
;
and
if
I
had
asked
for
the
house
of
such
*NL*
a
man
as
Mr.
Rankeillor
,
I
suppose
they
would
have
burst
out
laughing
in
*NL*
my
face
.
So
I
went
up
and
down
,
and
through
the
street
,
and
down
to
*NL*
the
harbour-side
,
like
a
dog
that
has
lost
its
master
,
with
a
strange
*NL*
gnawing
in
my
inwards
,
and
every
now
and
then
a
movement
of
despair
.
*NL*
It
grew
to
be
high
day
at
last
,
perhaps
nine
in
the
forenoon
;
and
I
was
*NL*
worn
with
these
wanderings
,
and
chanced
to
have
stopped
in
front
of
*NL*
a
very
good
house
on
the
landward
side
,
a
house
with
beautiful
,
clear
*NL*
glass
windows
,
flowering
knots
upon
the
sills
,
the
walls
new-harled
*
and
*NL*
a
chase-dog
sitting
yawning
on
the
step
like
one
that
was
at
home
.
Well
,
*NL*
I
was
even
envying
this
dumb
brute
,
when
the
door
fell
open
and
*NL*
there
issued
forth
a
shrewd
,
ruddy
,
kindly
,
consequential
man
in
a
*NL*
well-powdered
wig
and
spectacles
.
I
was
in
such
a
plight
that
no
one
set
*NL*
eyes
on
me
once
,
but
he
looked
at
me
again
;
and
this
gentleman
,
as
it
*NL*
proved
,
was
so
much
struck
with
my
poor
appearance
that
he
came
straight
*NL*
up
to
me
and
asked
me
what
I
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
Newly
rough-cast
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
I
was
come
to
the
Queensferry
on
business
,
and
taking
heart
*NL*
of
grace
,
asked
him
to
direct
me
to
the
house
of
Mr.
Rankeillor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
''
said
he
,
``
that
is
his
house
that
I
have
just
come
out
of
;
and
for
*NL*
a
rather
singular
chance
,
I
am
that
very
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
sir
,
''
said
I
,
``
I
have
to
beg
the
favour
of
an
interview
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
know
your
name
,
''
said
he
,
``
nor
yet
your
face
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
name
is
David
Balfour
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
David
Balfour
?
''
he
repeated
,
in
rather
a
high
tone
,
like
one
surprised
.
*NL*
``
And
where
have
you
come
from
,
Mr.
David
Balfour
?
''
he
asked
,
looking
me
*NL*
pretty
drily
in
the
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
come
from
a
great
many
strange
places
,
sir
,
''
said
I
;
``
but
I
*NL*
think
it
would
be
as
well
to
tell
you
where
and
how
in
a
more
private
*NL*
manner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
seemed
to
muse
awhile
,
holding
his
lip
in
his
hand
,
and
looking
now
*NL*
at
me
and
now
upon
the
causeway
of
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
says
he
,
``
that
will
be
the
best
,
no
doubt
.
''
And
he
led
me
back
*NL*
with
him
into
his
house
,
cried
out
to
some
one
whom
I
could
not
see
*NL*
that
he
would
be
engaged
all
morning
,
and
brought
me
into
a
little
dusty
*NL*
chamber
full
of
books
and
documents
.
Here
he
sate
down
,
and
bade
me
*NL*
be
seated
;
though
I
thought
he
looked
a
little
ruefully
from
his
clean
*NL*
chair
to
my
muddy
rags
.
``
And
now
,
''
says
he
,
``
if
you
have
any
business
,
*NL*
pray
be
brief
and
come
swiftly
to
the
point
.
Nec
gemino
bellum
Trojanum
*NL*
orditur
ab
ovo
--
do
you
understand
that
?
''
says
he
,
with
a
keen
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
even
do
as
Horace
says
,
sir
,
''
I
answered
,
smiling
,
``
and
carry
*NL*
you
in
medias
res
.
''
He
nodded
as
if
he
was
well
pleased
,
and
indeed
his
*NL*
scrap
of
Latin
had
been
set
to
test
me
.
For
all
that
,
and
though
I
was
*NL*
somewhat
encouraged
,
the
blood
came
in
my
face
when
I
added
:
``
I
have
*NL*
reason
to
believe
myself
some
rights
on
the
estate
of
Shaws
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
got
a
paper
book
out
of
a
drawer
and
set
it
before
him
open
.
``
Well
?
''
*NL*
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
had
shot
my
bolt
and
sat
speechless
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
come
,
Mr.
Balfour
,
''
said
he
,
``
you
must
continue
.
Where
were
you
*NL*
born
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
Essendean
,
sir
,
''
said
I
,
``
the
year
1733
,
the
12th
of
March
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
seemed
to
follow
this
statement
in
his
paper
book
;
but
what
that
*NL*
meant
I
knew
not
.
``
Your
father
and
mother
?
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
father
was
Alexander
Balfour
,
schoolmaster
of
that
place
,
''
said
I
,
*NL*
``
and
my
mother
Grace
Pitarrow
;
I
think
her
people
were
from
Angus
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
any
papers
proving
your
identity
?
''
asked
Mr.
Rankeillor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
''
said
I
,
``
but
they
are
in
the
hands
of
Mr.
Campbell
,
the
*NL*
minister
,
and
could
be
readily
produced
.
Mr.
Campbell
,
too
,
would
give
*NL*
me
his
word
;
and
for
that
matter
,
I
do
not
think

``

I.

he

*NL*
``
By
whom

I
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
ever
meet
a

asked
Mr.
Rankeillor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
so
,
sir

for
my
sins

''
said
I
;
``
for
it
was
by
his
means
and
the
*NL*
procurement
of
my
uncle

that
I
was
kidnapped
within

of
this
town

*NL*
carried
to

suffered
shipwreck

a
hundred
other
hardships

*NL*

before
you
to-day
in
this
poor
accoutrement

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
say
you
were
shipwrecked

''
said
Rankeillor
;
``
where
was
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Off
the
south
end
of
the
Isle
of
Mull

said
I.
``
The
name
of
the

I
was

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
says
he
,
smiling
,
``
you
are
deeper
than
me
in
the
geography
.
But
so
*NL*
far
,
I
may
tell
you
,
this
agrees
pretty
exactly
with
other
informations
*NL*
that
I
hold
.
But
you
say
you
were
kidnapped
;
in
what
sense
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
plain
meaning
of
the
word
,
sir

''
said
I.
``
I
was
on
my
way
to
*NL*
your
house

when
I
was
trepanned
on
board
the
brig

cruelly
struck
down
,
*NL*
thrown
below
,
and
knew
no
more
of
anything
till
we
were
far
at
sea
.
I
*NL*
was
destined
for
the
plantations
;
a
fate
that
,
in
God
's
providence
,
I
*NL*
have
escaped
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
brig
was
lost
on
June
the
27th
,
''
says
he
,
looking
in
his
book
,
*NL*
``
and
we
are
now
at
August
the
24th
.
Here
is
a
considerable
hiatus
,
Mr.
*NL*
Balfour
,
of
near
upon
two
months
.
It
has
already
caused
a
vast
amount
*NL*
of
trouble
to
your
friends
;
and
I
own
I
shall
not
be
very
well
contented
*NL*
until
it
is
set
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
sir
,
''
said
I
,
``
these
months
are
very
easily
filled
up
;
but
yet
*NL*
before
I
told
my
story
,
I
would
be
glad
to
know
that
I
was
talking
to
a
*NL*
friend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
to
argue
in
a
circle
,
''
said
the
lawyer
.
``
I
can
not
be
convinced
*NL*
till
I
have
heard
you
.
I
can
not
be
your
friend
till
I
am
properly
*NL*
informed
.
If
you
were
more
trustful
,
it
would
better
befit
your
time
of
*NL*
life
.
And
you
know
,
Mr.
Balfour
,
we
have
a
proverb
in
the
country
that
*NL*
evil-doers
are
aye
evil-dreaders
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
to
forget
,
sir
,
''
said
I
,
``
that
I
have
already
suffered
by
*NL*
my
trustfulness
;
and
was
shipped
off
to
be
a
slave
by
the
very
man
that
*NL*
-LRB-
if
I
rightly
understand
-RRB-
is
your
employer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
while
I
had
been
gaining
ground
with
Mr.
Rankeillor
,
and
in
*NL*
proportion
as
I
gained
ground
,
gaining
confidence
.
But
at
this
sally
,
*NL*
which
I
made
with
something
of
a
smile
myself
,
he
fairly
laughed
aloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
''
said
he
,
``
it
is
not
so
bad
as
that
.
Fui
,
non
sum
.
I
was
indeed
*NL*
your
uncle
's
man
of
business
;
but
while
you
-LRB-
imberbis
juvenis
custode
*NL*
remoto
-RRB-
were
gallivanting
in
the
west
,
a
good
deal
of
water
has
run
*NL*
under
the
bridges
;
and
if
your
ears
did
not
sing
,
it
was
not
for
lack
of
*NL*
being
talked
about
.
On
the
very
day
of
your
sea
disaster
,
Mr.
Campbell
*NL*
stalked
into
my
office
,
demanding
you
from
all
the
winds
.
I
had
never
*NL*
heard
of
your
existence
;
but
I
had
known
your
father
;
and
from
matters
*NL*
in
my
competence
-LRB-
to
be
touched
upon
hereafter
-RRB-
I
was
disposed
to
fear
*NL*
the
worst
.
Mr.
Ebenezer
admitted
having
seen
you
;
declared
-LRB-
what
seemed
*NL*
improbable
-RRB-
that
he
had
given
you
considerable
sums
;
and
that
you
had
*NL*
started
for
the
continent
of
Europe
,
intending
to
fulfil
your
education
,
*NL*
which
was
probable
and
praiseworthy
.
Interrogated
how
you
had
come
to
*NL*
send
no
word
to
Mr.
Campbell
,
he
deponed
that
you
had
expressed
a
great
*NL*
desire
to
break
with
your
past
life
.
Further
interrogated
where
you
now
*NL*
were
,
protested
ignorance
,
but
believed
you
were
in
Leyden
.
That
is
a
*NL*
close
sum
of
his
replies
.
I
am
not
exactly
sure
that
any
one
believed
*NL*
him
,
''
continued
Mr.
Rankeillor
with
a
smile
;
``
and
in
particular
he
so
*NL*
much
disrelished
me
expressions
of
mine
that
-LRB-
in
a
word
-RRB-
he
showed
me
to
*NL*
the
door
.
We
were
then
at
a
full
stand
;
for
whatever
shrewd
suspicions
*NL*
we
might
entertain
,
we
had
no
shadow
of
probation
.
In
the
very
article
,
*NL*
comes
Captain
Hoseason
with
the
story
of
your
drowning
;
whereupon
all
*NL*
fell
through
;
with
no
consequences
but
concern
to
Mr.
Campbell
,
injury
*NL*
to
my
pocket
,
and
another
blot
upon
your
uncle
's
character
,
which
could
*NL*
very
ill
afford
it
.
And
now
,
Mr.
Balfour
,
''
said
he
,
``
you
understand
*NL*
the
whole
process
of
these
matters
,
and
can
judge
for
yourself
to
what
*NL*
extent
I
may
be
trusted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Indeed
he
was
more
pedantic
than
I
can
represent
him
,
and
placed
more
*NL*
scraps
of
Latin
in
his
speech
;
but
it
was
all
uttered
with
a
fine
*NL*
geniality
of
eye
and
manner
which
went
far
to
conquer
my
distrust
.
*NL*
Moreover
,
I
could
see
he
now
treated
me
as
if
I
was
myself
beyond
a
*NL*
doubt
;
so
that
first
point
of
my
identity
seemed
fully
granted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
said
I
,
``
if
I
tell
you
my
story
,
I
must
commit
a
friend
's
life
*NL*
to
your
discretion
.
Pass
me
your
word
it
shall
be
sacred
;
and
for
what
*NL*
touches
myself
,
I
will
ask
no
better
guarantee
than
just
your
face
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
passed
me
his
word
very
seriously
.
``
But
,
''
said
he
,
``
these
are
rather
*NL*
alarming
prolocutions
;
and
if
there
are
in
your
story
any
little
jostles
*NL*
to
the
law
,
I
would
beg
you
to
bear
in
mind
that
I
am
a
lawyer
,
and
pass
*NL*
lightly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thereupon
I
told
him
my
story
from
the
first
,
he
listening
with
his
*NL*
spectacles
thrust
up
and
his
eyes
closed
,
so
that
I
sometimes
feared
*NL*
he
was
asleep
.
But
no
such
matter
!
he
heard
every
word
-LRB-
as
I
found
*NL*
afterward
-RRB-
with
such
quickness
of
hearing
and
precision
of
memory
as
*NL*
often
surprised
me
.
Even
strange
outlandish
Gaelic
names
,
heard
for
that
*NL*
time
only
,
he
remembered
and
would
remind
me
of
,
years
after
.
Yet
when
I
*NL*
called
Alan
Breck
in
full
,
we
had
an
odd
scene
.
The
name
of
Alan
had
of
*NL*
course
rung
through
Scotland
,
with
the
news
of
the
Appin
murder
and
the
*NL*
offer
of
the
reward
;
and
it
had
no
sooner
escaped
me
than
the
lawyer
*NL*
moved
in
his
seat
and
opened
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
name
no
unnecessary
names
,
Mr.
Balfour
,
''
said
he
;
``
above
all
of
*NL*
Highlanders
,
many
of
whom
are
obnoxious
to
the
law
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
might
have
been
better
not
,
''
said
I
,
``
but
since
I
have
let
it
*NL*
slip
,
I
may
as
well
continue
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
,
''
said
Mr.
Rankeillor
.
``
I
am
somewhat
dull
of
hearing
,
as
*NL*
you
may
have
remarked
;
and
I
am
far
from
sure
I
caught
the
name
exactly
.
*NL*
We
will
call
your
friend
,
if
you
please
,
Mr.
Thomson
--
that
there
may
*NL*
be
no
reflections
.
And
in
future
,
I
would
take
some
such
way
with
any
*NL*
Highlander
that
you
may
have
to
mention
--
dead
or
alive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
,
I
saw
he
must
have
heard
the
name
all
too
clearly
,
and
had
*NL*
already
guessed
I
might
be
coming
to
the
murder
.
If
he
chose
to
play
*NL*
this
part
of
ignorance
,
it
was
no
matter
of
mine
;
so
I
smiled
,
said
it
*NL*
was
no
very
Highland-sounding
name
,
and
consented
.
Through
all
the
rest
*NL*
of
my
story
Alan
was
Mr.
Thomson
;
which
amused
me
the
more
,
as
it
was
a
*NL*
piece
of
policy
after
his
own
heart
.
James
Stewart
,
in
like
manner
,
*NL*
was
mentioned
under
the
style
of
Mr.
Thomson
's
kinsman
;
Colin
Campbell
*NL*
passed
as
a
Mr.
Glen
;
and
to
Cluny
,
when
I
came
to
that
part
of
my
tale
,
*NL*
I
gave
the
name
of
``
Mr.
Jameson
,
a
Highland
chief
.
''
It
was
truly
the
*NL*
most
open
farce
,
and
I
wondered
that
the
lawyer
should
care
to
keep
it
*NL*
up
;
but
,
after
all
,
it
was
quite
in
the
taste
of
that
age
,
when
there
*NL*
were
two
parties
in
the
state
,
and
quiet
persons
,
with
no
very
high
*NL*
opinions
of
their
own
,
sought
out
every
cranny
to
avoid
offence
to
*NL*
either
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
''
said
the
lawyer
,
when
I
had
quite
done
,
``
this
is
a
great
*NL*
epic
,
a
great
Odyssey
of
yours
.
You
must
tell
it
,
sir
,
in
a
sound
*NL*
Latinity
when
your
scholarship
is
riper
;
or
in
English
if
you
please
,
*NL*
though
for
my
part
I
prefer
the
stronger
tongue
.
You
have
rolled
*NL*
much
;
quae
regio
in
terris
--
what
parish
in
Scotland
-LRB-
to
make
a
homely
*NL*
translation
-RRB-
has
not
been
filled
with
your
wanderings
?
You
have
shown
,
*NL*
besides
,
a
singular
aptitude
for
getting
into
false
positions
;
and
,
yes
,
*NL*
upon
the
whole
,
for
behaving
well
in
them
.
This
Mr.
Thomson
seems
to
*NL*
me
a
gentleman
of
some
choice
qualities
,
though
perhaps
a
trifle
*NL*
bloody-minded
.
It
would
please
me
none
the
worse
,
if
-LRB-
with
all
his
*NL*
merits
-RRB-
he
were
soused
in
the
North
Sea
,
for
the
man
,
Mr.
David
,
is
a
*NL*
sore
embarrassment
.
But
you
are
doubtless
quite
right
to
adhere
to
him
;
*NL*
indubitably
,
he
adhered
to
you
.
It
comes
--
we
may
say
--
he
was
your
true
*NL*
companion
;
nor
less
paribus
curis
vestigia
figit
,
for
I
dare
say
you
*NL*
would
both
take
an
orra
thought
upon
the
gallows
.
Well
,
well
,
these
days
*NL*
are
fortunately
by
;
and
I
think
-LRB-
speaking
humanly
-RRB-
that
you
are
near
*NL*
the
end
of
your
troubles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
thus
moralised
on
my
adventures
,
he
looked
upon
me
with
so
much
*NL*
humour
and
benignity
that
I
could
scarce
contain
my
satisfaction
.
I
had
*NL*
been
so
long
wandering
with
lawless
people
,
and
making
my
bed
upon
the
*NL*
hills
and
under
the
bare
sky
,
that
to
sit
once
more
in
a
clean
,
covered
*NL*
house
,
and
to
talk
amicably
with
a
gentleman
in
broadcloth
,
seemed
*NL*
mighty
elevations
.
Even
as
I
thought
so
,
my
eye
fell
on
my
unseemly
*NL*
tatters
,
and
I
was
once
more
plunged
in
confusion
.
But
the
lawyer
saw
*NL*
and
understood
me
.
He
rose
,
called
over
the
stair
to
lay
another
plate
,
*NL*
for
Mr.
Balfour
would
stay
to
dinner
,
and
led
me
into
a
bedroom
in
the
*NL*
upper
part
of
the
house
.
Here
he
set
before
me
water
and
soap
,
and
a
*NL*
comb
;
and
laid
out
some
clothes
that
belonged
to
his
son
;
and
here
,
with
*NL*
another
apposite
tag
,
he
left
me
to
my
toilet
.

CHAPTER
XXVIII
*NL*
*NL*
I
GO
IN
QUEST
OF
MY
INHERITANCE
*NL*
*NL*
I
made
what
change
I
could
in
my
appearance
;
and
blithe
was
I
to
look
in
*NL*
the
glass
and
find
the
beggarman
a
thing
of
the
past
,
and
David
Balfour
*NL*
come
to
life
again
.
And
yet
I
was
ashamed
of
the
change
too
,
and
,
above
*NL*
all
,
of
the
borrowed
clothes
.
When
I
had
done
,
Mr.
Rankeillor
caught
*NL*
me
on
the
stair
,
made
me
his
compliments
,
and
had
me
again
into
the
*NL*
cabinet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sit
ye
down
,
Mr.
David
,
''
said
he
,
``
and
now
that
you
are
looking
a
*NL*
little
more
like
yourself
,
let
me
see
if
I
can
find
you
any
news
.
You
*NL*
will
be
wondering
,
no
doubt
,
about
your
father
and
your
uncle
?
To
be
*NL*
sure
it
is
a
singular
tale
;
and
the
explanation
is
one
that
I
blush
to
*NL*
have
to
offer
you
.
For
,
''
says
he
,
really
with
embarrassment
,
``
the
matter
*NL*
hinges
on
a
love
affair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Truly
,
''
said
I
,
``
I
can
not
very
well
join
that
notion
with
my
uncle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
your
uncle
,
Mr.
David
,
was
not
always
old
,
''
replied
the
lawyer
,
*NL*
``
and
what
may
perhaps
surprise
you
more
,
not
always
ugly
.
He
had
a
fine
,
*NL*
gallant
air
;
people
stood
in
their
doors
to
look
after
him
,
as
he
*NL*
went
by
upon
a
mettle
horse
.
I
have
seen
it
with
these
eyes
,
and
I
*NL*
ingenuously
confess
,
not
altogether
without
envy
;
for
I
was
a
plain
lad
*NL*
myself
and
a
plain
man
's
son
;
and
in
those
days
it
was
a
case
of
Odi
te
,
*NL*
qui
bellus
es
,
Sabelle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
sounds
like
a
dream
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
ay
,
''
said
the
lawyer
,
``
that
is
how
it
is
with
youth
and
age
.
Nor
*NL*
was
that
all
,
but
he
had
a
spirit
of
his
own
that
seemed
to
promise
*NL*
great
things
in
the
future
.
In
1715
,
what
must
he
do
but
run
away
to
*NL*
join
the
rebels
?
It
was
your
father
that
pursued
him
,
found
him
in
a
*NL*
ditch
,
and
brought
him
back
multum
gementem
;
to
the
mirth
of
the
whole
*NL*
country
.
However
,
majora
canamus
--
the
two
lads
fell
in
love
,
and
that
*NL*
with
the
same
lady
.
Mr.
Ebenezer
,
who
was
the
admired
and
the
beloved
,
*NL*
and
the
spoiled
one
,
made
,
no
doubt
,
mighty
certain
of
the
victory
;
*NL*
and
when
he
found
he
had
deceived
himself
,
screamed
like
a
peacock
.
*NL*
The
whole
country
heard
of
it
;
now
he
lay
sick
at
home
,
with
his
silly
*NL*
family
standing
round
the
bed
in
tears
;
now
he
rode
from
public-house
*NL*
to
public-house
,
and
shouted
his
sorrows
into
the
lug
of
Tom
,
Dick
,
and
*NL*
Harry
.
Your
father
,
Mr.
David
,
was
a
kind
gentleman
;
but
he
was
weak
,
*NL*
dolefully
weak
;
took
all
this
folly
with
a
long
countenance
;
and
one
*NL*
day
--
by
your
leave
!
--
resigned
the
lady
.
She
was
no
such
fool
,
however
;
*NL*
it
's
from
her
you
must
inherit
your
excellent
good
sense
;
and
she
*NL*
refused
to
be
bandied
from
one
to
another
.
Both
got
upon
their
knees
*NL*
to
her
;
and
the
upshot
of
the
matter
for
that
while
was
that
she
showed
*NL*
both
of
them
the
door
.
That
was
in
August
;
dear
me
!
the
same
year
I
came
*NL*
from
college
.
The
scene
must
have
been
highly
farcical
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
myself
it
was
a
silly
business
,
but
I
could
not
forget
my
*NL*
father
had
a
hand
in
it
.
``
Surely
,
sir
,
it
had
some
note
of
tragedy
,
''
*NL*
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
no
,
sir
,
not
at
all
,
''
returned
the
lawyer
.
``
For
tragedy
implies
*NL*
some
ponderable
matter
in
dispute
,
some
dignus
vindice
nodus
;
and
this
*NL*
piece
of
work
was
all
about
the
petulance
of
a
young
ass
that
had
been
*NL*
spoiled
,
and
wanted
nothing
so
much
as
to
be
tied
up
and
soundly
belted
.
*NL*
However
,
that
was
not
your
father
's
view
;
and
the
end
of
it
was
,
that
*NL*
from
concession
to
concession
on
your
father
's
part
,
and
from
one
height
*NL*
to
another
of
squalling
,
sentimental
selfishness
upon
your
uncle
's
,
they
*NL*
came
at
last
to
drive
a
sort
of
bargain
,
from
whose
ill
results
you
have
*NL*
recently
been
smarting
.
The
one
man
took
the
lady
,
the
other
the
estate
.
*NL*
Now
,
Mr.
David
,
they
talk
a
great
deal
of
charity
and
generosity
;
but
in
*NL*
this
disputable
state
of
life
,
I
often
think
the
happiest
consequences
*NL*
seem
to
flow
when
a
gentleman
consults
his
lawyer
,
and
takes
all
the
law
*NL*
allows
him
.
Anyhow
,
this
piece
of
Quixotry
on
your
father
's
part
,
as
*NL*
it
was
unjust
in
itself
,
has
brought
forth
a
monstrous
family
of
*NL*
injustices
.
Your
father
and
mother
lived
and
died
poor
folk
;
you
were
*NL*
poorly
reared
;
and
in
the
meanwhile
,
what
a
time
it
has
been
for
the
*NL*
tenants
on
the
estate
of
Shaws
!
And
I
might
add
-LRB-
if
it
was
a
matter
I
*NL*
cared
much
about
-RRB-
what
a
time
for
Mr.
Ebenezer
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
that
is
certainly
the
strangest
part
of
all
,
''
said
I
,
``
that
a
*NL*
man
's
nature
should
thus
change
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
,
''
said
Mr.
Rankeillor
.
``
And
yet
I
imagine
it
was
natural
enough
.
*NL*
He
could
not
think
that
he
had
played
a
handsome
part
.
Those
who
knew
*NL*
the
story
gave
him
the
cold
shoulder
;
those
who
knew
it
not
,
seeing
one
*NL*
brother
disappear
,
and
the
other
succeed
in
the
estate
,
raised
a
cry
of
*NL*
murder
;
so
that
upon
all
sides
he
found
himself
evited
.
Money
was
all
*NL*
he
got
by
his
bargain
;
well
,
he
came
to
think
the
more
of
money
.
He
was
*NL*
selfish
when
he
was
young
,
he
is
selfish
now
that
he
is
old
;
and
the
*NL*
latter
end
of
all
these
pretty
manners
and
fine
feelings
you
have
seen
*NL*
for
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
''
said
I
,
``
and
in
all
this
,
what
is
my
position
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
estate
is
yours
beyond
a
doubt
,
''
replied
the
lawyer
.
``
It
matters
*NL*
nothing
what
your
father
signed
,
you
are
the
heir
of
entail
.
But
your
*NL*
uncle
is
a
man
to
fight
the
indefensible
;
and
it
would
be
likely
your
*NL*
identity
that
he
would
call
in
question
.
A
lawsuit
is
always
expensive
,
*NL*
and
a
family
lawsuit
always
scandalous
;
besides
which
,
if
any
of
your
*NL*
doings
with
your
friend
Mr.
Thomson
were
to
come
out
,
we
might
find
that
*NL*
we
had
burned
our
fingers
.
The
kidnapping
,
to
be
sure
,
would
be
a
court
*NL*
card
upon
our
side
,
if
we
could
only
prove
it
.
But
it
may
be
difficult
*NL*
to
prove
;
and
my
advice
-LRB-
upon
the
whole
-RRB-
is
to
make
a
very
easy
bargain
*NL*
with
your
uncle
,
perhaps
even
leaving
him
at
Shaws
where
he
has
*NL*
taken
root
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
,
and
contenting
yourself
in
the
*NL*
meanwhile
with
a
fair
provision
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
I
was
very
willing
to
be
easy
,
and
that
to
carry
family
*NL*
concerns
before
the
public
was
a
step
from
which
I
was
naturally
much
*NL*
averse
.
In
the
meantime
-LRB-
thinking
to
myself
-RRB-
I
began
to
see
the
outlines
*NL*
of
that
scheme
on
which
we
afterwards
acted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
great
affair
,
''
I
asked
,
``
is
to
bring
home
to
him
the
kidnapping
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
,
''
said
Mr.
Rankeillor
,
``
and
if
possible
,
out
of
court
.
For
mark
*NL*
you
here
,
Mr.
David
:
we
could
no
doubt
find
some
men
of
the
Covenant
who
*NL*
would
swear
to
your
reclusion
;
but
once
they
were
in
the
box
,
we
could
*NL*
no
longer
check
their
testimony
,
and
some
word
of
your
friend
Mr.
*NL*
Thomson
must
certainly
crop
out
.
Which
-LRB-
from
what
you
have
let
fall
-RRB-
I
*NL*
can
not
think
to
be
desirable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
''
said
I
,
``
here
is
my
way
of
it
.
''
And
I
opened
my
plot
to
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
this
would
seem
to
involve
my
meeting
the
man
Thomson
?
''
says
he
,
*NL*
when
I
had
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
so
,
indeed
,
sir
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
doctor
!
''
cries
he
,
rubbing
his
brow
.
``
Dear
doctor
!
No
,
Mr.
David
,
*NL*
I
am
afraid
your
scheme
is
inadmissible
.
I
say
nothing
against
your
*NL*
friend
,
Mr.
Thomson
:
I
know
nothing
against
him
;
and
if
I
did
--
mark
*NL*
this
,
Mr.
David
!
--
it
would
be
my
duty
to
lay
hands
on
him
.
Now
I
put
it
*NL*
to
you
:
is
it
wise
to
meet
?
He
may
have
matters
to
his
charge
.
He
may
*NL*
not
have
told
you
all
.
His
name
may
not
be
even
Thomson
!
''
cries
the
*NL*
lawyer
,
twinkling
;
``
for
some
of
these
fellows
will
pick
up
names
by
the
*NL*
roadside
as
another
would
gather
haws
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
be
the
judge
,
sir
,
''
said
I
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
clear
my
plan
had
taken
hold
upon
his
fancy
,
for
he
kept
*NL*
musing
to
himself
till
we
were
called
to
dinner
and
the
company
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Rankeillor
;
and
that
lady
had
scarce
left
us
again
to
ourselves
and
a
*NL*
bottle
of
wine
,
ere
he
was
back
harping
on
my
proposal
.
When
and
where
*NL*
was
I
to
meet
my
friend
Mr.
Thomson
;
was
I
sure
of
Mr.
T.
's
discretion
;
*NL*
supposing
we
could
catch
the
old
fox
tripping
,
would
I
consent
to
such
*NL*
and
such
a
term
of
an
agreement
--
these
and
the
like
questions
he
kept
*NL*
asking
at
long
intervals
,
while
he
thoughtfully
rolled
his
wine
upon
his
*NL*
tongue
.
When
I
had
answered
all
of
them
,
seemingly
to
his
contentment
,
*NL*
he
fell
into
a
still
deeper
muse
,
even
the
claret
being
now
forgotten
.
*NL*
Then
he
got
a
sheet
of
paper
and
a
pencil
,
and
set
to
work
writing
and
*NL*
weighing
every
word
;
and
at
last
touched
a
bell
and
had
his
clerk
into
*NL*
the
chamber
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Torrance
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
must
have
this
written
out
fair
against
*NL*
to-night
;
and
when
it
is
done
,
you
will
be
so
kind
as
put
on
your
hat
*NL*
and
be
ready
to
come
along
with
this
gentleman
and
me
,
for
you
will
*NL*
probably
be
wanted
as
a
witness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
sir
,
''
cried
I
,
as
soon
as
the
clerk
was
gone
,
``
are
you
to
venture
*NL*
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
so
it
would
appear
,
''
says
he
,
filling
his
glass
.
``
But
let
us
speak
*NL*
no
more
of
business
.
The
very
sight
of
Torrance
brings
in
my
head
a
*NL*
little
droll
matter
of
some
years
ago
,
when
I
had
made
a
tryst
with
the
*NL*
poor
oaf
at
the
cross
of
Edinburgh
.
Each
had
gone
his
proper
errand
;
and
*NL*
when
it
came
four
o'clock
,
Torrance
had
been
taking
a
glass
and
did
*NL*
not
know
his
master
,
and
I
,
who
had
forgot
my
spectacles
,
was
so
blind
*NL*
without
them
,
that
I
give
you
my
word
I
did
not
know
my
own
clerk
.
''
And
*NL*
thereupon
he
laughed
heartily
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
it
was
an
odd
chance
,
and
smiled
out
of
politeness
;
but
what
held
*NL*
me
all
the
afternoon
in
wonder
,
he
kept
returning
and
dwelling
on
this
*NL*
story
,
and
telling
it
again
with
fresh
details
and
laughter
;
so
that
I
*NL*
began
at
last
to
be
quite
put
out
of
countenance
and
feel
ashamed
for
my
*NL*
friend
's
folly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
the
time
I
had
appointed
with
Alan
,
we
set
out
from
the
house
,
*NL*
Mr.
Rankeillor
and
I
arm
in
arm
,
and
Torrance
following
behind
with
the
*NL*
deed
in
his
pocket
and
a
covered
basket
in
his
hand
.
All
through
the
*NL*
town
,
the
lawyer
was
bowing
right
and
left
,
and
continually
being
*NL*
button-holed
by
gentlemen
on
matters
of
burgh
or
private
business
;
and
I
*NL*
could
see
he
was
one
greatly
looked
up
to
in
the
county
.
At
last
we
were
*NL*
clear
of
the
houses
,
and
began
to
go
along
the
side
of
the
haven
and
*NL*
towards
the
Hawes
Inn
and
the
Ferry
pier
,
the
scene
of
my
misfortune
.
I
*NL*
could
not
look
upon
the
place
without
emotion
,
recalling
how
many
that
*NL*
had
been
there
with
me
that
day
were
now
no
more
:
Ransome
taken
,
I
could
*NL*
hope
,
from
the
evil
to
come
;
Shuan
passed
where
I
dared
not
follow
him
;
*NL*
and
the
poor
souls
that
had
gone
down
with
the
brig
in
her
last
plunge
.
*NL*
All
these
,
and
the
brig
herself
,
I
had
outlived
;
and
come
through
these
*NL*
hardships
and
fearful
perils
without
scath
.
My
only
thought
should
have
*NL*
been
of
gratitude
;
and
yet
I
could
not
behold
the
place
without
sorrow
*NL*
for
others
and
a
chill
of
recollected
fear
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
so
thinking
when
,
upon
a
sudden
,
Mr.
Rankeillor
cried
out
,
clapped
*NL*
his
hand
to
his
pockets
,
and
began
to
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
''
he
cries
,
``
if
this
be
not
a
farcical
adventure
!
After
all
that
I
*NL*
said
,
I
have
forgot
my
glasses
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
,
of
course
,
I
understood
the
purpose
of
his
anecdote
,
and
knew
*NL*
that
if
he
had
left
his
spectacles
at
home
,
it
had
been
done
on
purpose
,
*NL*
so
that
he
might
have
the
benefit
of
Alan
's
help
without
the
awkwardness
*NL*
of
recognising
him
.
And
indeed
it
was
well
thought
upon
;
for
now
*NL*
-LRB-
suppose
things
to
go
the
very
worst
-RRB-
how
could
Rankeillor
swear
to
*NL*
my
friend
's
identity
,
or
how
be
made
to
bear
damaging
evidence
against
*NL*
myself
?
For
all
that
,
he
had
been
a
long
while
of
finding
out
his
want
,
*NL*
and
had
spoken
to
and
recognised
a
good
few
persons
as
we
came
through
*NL*
the
town
;
and
I
had
little
doubt
myself
that
he
saw
reasonably
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
we
were
past
the
Hawes
-LRB-
where
I
recognised
the
landlord
*NL*
smoking
his
pipe
in
the
door
,
and
was
amazed
to
see
him
look
no
older
-RRB-
*NL*
Mr.
Rankeillor
changed
the
order
of
march
,
walking
behind
with
Torrance
*NL*
and
sending
me
forward
in
the
manner
of
a
scout
.
I
went
up
the
hill
,
*NL*
whistling
from
time
to
time
my
Gaelic
air
;
and
at
length
I
had
the
*NL*
pleasure
to
hear
it
answered
and
to
see
Alan
rise
from
behind
a
bush
.
He
*NL*
was
somewhat
dashed
in
spirits
,
having
passed
a
long
day
alone
skulking
*NL*
in
the
county
,
and
made
but
a
poor
meal
in
an
alehouse
near
Dundas
.
But
*NL*
at
the
mere
sight
of
my
clothes
,
he
began
to
brighten
up
;
and
as
soon
as
*NL*
I
had
told
him
in
what
a
forward
state
our
matters
were
and
the
part
I
*NL*
looked
to
him
to
play
in
what
remained
,
he
sprang
into
a
new
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
is
a
very
good
notion
of
yours
,
''
says
he
;
``
and
I
dare
to
say
*NL*
that
you
could
lay
your
hands
upon
no
better
man
to
put
it
through
than
*NL*
Alan
Breck
.
It
is
not
a
thing
-LRB-
mark
ye
-RRB-
that
any
one
could
do
,
but
takes
*NL*
a
gentleman
of
penetration
.
But
it
sticks
in
my
head
your
lawyer-man
*NL*
will
be
somewhat
wearying
to
see
me
,
''
says
Alan
.
*NL*
*NL*
Accordingly
I
cried
and
waved
on
Mr.
Rankeillor
,
who
came
up
alone
and
*NL*
was
presented
to
my
friend
,
Mr.
Thomson
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Thomson
,
I
am
pleased
to
meet
you
,
''
said
he
.
``
But
I
have
forgotten
*NL*
my
glasses
;
and
our
friend
,
Mr.
David
here
''
-LRB-
clapping
me
on
the
*NL*
shoulder
-RRB-
,
``
will
tell
you
that
I
am
little
better
than
blind
,
and
that
*NL*
you
must
not
be
surprised
if
I
pass
you
by
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
he
said
,
thinking
that
Alan
would
be
pleased
;
but
the
Highlandman
's
*NL*
vanity
was
ready
to
startle
at
a
less
matter
than
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
sir
,
''
says
he
,
stiffly
,
``
I
would
say
it
mattered
the
less
as
we
*NL*
are
met
here
for
a
particular
end
,
to
see
justice
done
to
Mr.
Balfour
;
*NL*
and
by
what
I
can
see
,
not
very
likely
to
have
much
else
in
common
.
But
*NL*
I
accept
your
apology
,
which
was
a
very
proper
one
to
make
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
is
more
than
I
could
look
for
,
Mr.
Thomson
,
''
said
Rankeillor
,
*NL*
heartily
.
``
And
now
as
you
and
I
are
the
chief
actors
in
this
enterprise
,
*NL*
I
think
we
should
come
into
a
nice
agreement
;
to
which
end
,
I
propose
*NL*
that
you
should
lend
me
your
arm
,
for
-LRB-
what
with
the
dusk
and
the
want
*NL*
of
my
glasses
-RRB-
I
am
not
very
clear
as
to
the
path
;
and
as
for
you
,
Mr.
*NL*
David
,
you
will
find
Torrance
a
pleasant
kind
of
body
to
speak
with
.
*NL*
Only
let
me
remind
you
,
it
's
quite
needless
he
should
hear
more
of
your
*NL*
adventures
or
those
of
--
ahem
--
Mr.
Thomson
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Accordingly
these
two
went
on
ahead
in
very
close
talk
,
and
Torrance
and
*NL*
I
brought
up
the
rear
.
*NL*
*NL*
Night
was
quite
come
when
we
came
in
view
of
the
house
of
Shaws
.
Ten
*NL*
had
been
gone
some
time
;
it
was
dark
and
mild
,
with
a
pleasant
,
rustling
*NL*
wind
in
the
south-west
that
covered
the
sound
of
our
approach
;
and
as
we
*NL*
drew
near
we
saw
no
glimmer
of
light
in
any
portion
of
the
building
.
It
*NL*
seemed
my
uncle
was
already
in
bed
,
which
was
indeed
the
best
thing
for
*NL*
our
arrangements
.
We
made
our
last
whispered
consultations
some
fifty
*NL*
yards
away
;
and
then
the
lawyer
and
Torrance
and
I
crept
quietly
up
and
*NL*
crouched
down
beside
the
corner
of
the
house
;
and
as
soon
as
we
were
*NL*
in
our
places
,
Alan
strode
to
the
door
without
concealment
and
began
to
*NL*
knock
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
XXIX
*NL*
*NL*
I
COME
INTO
MY
KINGDOM
*NL*
*NL*
For
some
time
Alan
volleyed
upon
the
door
,
and
his
knocking
only
roused
*NL*
the
echoes
of
the
house
and
neighbourhood
.
At
last
,
however
,
I
could
*NL*
hear
the
noise
of
a
window
gently
thrust
up
,
and
knew
that
my
uncle
*NL*
had
come
to
his
observatory
.
By
what
light
there
was
,
he
would
see
Alan
*NL*
standing
,
like
a
dark
shadow
,
on
the
steps
;
the
three
witnesses
were
*NL*
hidden
quite
out
of
his
view
;
so
that
there
was
nothing
to
alarm
an
*NL*
honest
man
in
his
own
house
.
For
all
that
,
he
studied
his
visitor
awhile
*NL*
in
silence
,
and
when
he
spoke
his
voice
had
a
quaver
of
misgiving
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
this
?
''
says
he
.
``
This
is
nae
kind
of
time
of
night
for
decent
*NL*
folk
;
and
I
hae
nae
trokings
*
wi
'
night-hawks
.
What
brings
ye
here
?
I
*NL*
have
a
blunderbush
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*
Dealings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
yoursel
'
,
Mr.
Balfour
?
''
returned
Alan
,
stepping
back
and
*NL*
looking
up
into
the
darkness
.
``
Have
a
care
of
that
blunderbuss
;
they
're
*NL*
nasty
things
to
burst
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
brings
ye
here
?
and
whae
are
ye
?
''
says
my
uncle
,
angrily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
manner
of
inclination
to
rowt
out
my
name
to
the
*NL*
country-side
,
''
said
Alan
;
``
but
what
brings
me
here
is
another
story
,
*NL*
being
more
of
your
affair
than
mine
;
and
if
ye
're
sure
it
's
what
ye
*NL*
would
like
,
I
'll
set
it
to
a
tune
and
sing
it
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
is
`
t
?
''
asked
my
uncle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
David
,
''
says
Alan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
was
that
?
''
cried
my
uncle
,
in
a
mighty
changed
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
give
ye
the
rest
of
the
name
,
then
?
''
said
Alan
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
pause
;
and
then
,
``
I
'm
thinking
I
'll
better
let
ye
in
,
''
says
*NL*
my
uncle
,
doubtfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dare
say
that
,
''
said
Alan
;
``
but
the
point
is
,
Would
I
go
?
Now
I
will
*NL*
tell
you
what
I
am
thinking
.
I
am
thinking
that
it
is
here
upon
this
*NL*
doorstep
that
we
must
confer
upon
this
business
;
and
it
shall
be
here
or
*NL*
nowhere
at
all
whatever
;
for
I
would
have
you
to
understand
that
I
am
as
*NL*
stiffnecked
as
yoursel
'
,
and
a
gentleman
of
better
family
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
change
of
note
disconcerted
Ebenezer
;
he
was
a
little
while
*NL*
digesting
it
,
and
then
says
he
,
``
Weel
,
weel
,
what
must
be
must
,
''
and
*NL*
shut
the
window
.
But
it
took
him
a
long
time
to
get
down-stairs
,
and
a
*NL*
still
longer
to
undo
the
fastenings
,
repenting
-LRB-
I
dare
say
-RRB-
and
taken
*NL*
with
fresh
claps
of
fear
at
every
second
step
and
every
bolt
and
bar
.
At
*NL*
last
,
however
,
we
heard
the
creak
of
the
hinges
,
and
it
seems
my
uncle
*NL*
slipped
gingerly
out
and
-LRB-
seeing
that
Alan
had
stepped
back
a
pace
or
*NL*
two
-RRB-
sate
him
down
on
the
top
doorstep
with
the
blunderbuss
ready
in
his
*NL*
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
,
now
''
says
he
,
``
mind
I
have
my
blunderbush
,
and
if
ye
take
a
step
*NL*
nearer
ye
're
as
good
as
deid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
a
very
civil
speech
,
''
says
Alan
,
``
to
be
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Na
,
''
says
my
uncle
,
``
but
this
is
no
a
very
chanty
kind
of
a
proceeding
,
*NL*
and
I
'm
bound
to
be
prepared
.
And
now
that
we
understand
each
other
,
*NL*
ye
'll
can
name
your
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
''
says
Alan
,
``
you
that
are
a
man
of
so
much
understanding
,
will
*NL*
doubtless
have
perceived
that
I
am
a
Hieland
gentleman
.
My
name
has
nae
*NL*
business
in
my
story
;
but
the
county
of
my
friends
is
no
very
far
from
*NL*
the
Isle
of
Mull
,
of
which
ye
will
have
heard
.
It
seems
there
was
a
*NL*
ship
lost
in
those
parts
;
and
the
next
day
a
gentleman
of
my
family
was
*NL*
seeking
wreck-wood
for
his
fire
along
the
sands
,
when
he
came
upon
a
lad
*NL*
that
was
half
drowned
.
Well
,
he
brought
him
to
;
and
he
and
some
other
*NL*
gentleman
took
and
clapped
him
in
an
auld
,
ruined
castle
,
where
from
*NL*
that
day
to
this
he
has
been
a
great
expense
to
my
friends
.
My
friends
*NL*
are
a
wee
wild-like
,
and
not
so
particular
about
the
law
as
some
that
*NL*
I
could
name
;
and
finding
that
the
lad
owned
some
decent
folk
,
and
was
*NL*
your
born
nephew
,
Mr.
Balfour
,
they
asked
me
to
give
ye
a
bit
call
and
*NL*
confer
upon
the
matter
.
And
I
may
tell
ye
at
the
off-go
,
unless
we
can
*NL*
agree
upon
some
terms
,
ye
are
little
likely
to
set
eyes
upon
him
.
For
my
*NL*
friends
,
''
added
Alan
,
simply
,
``
are
no
very
well
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
uncle
cleared
his
throat
.
``
I
'm
no
very
caring
,
''
says
he
.
``
He
wasnae
a
*NL*
good
lad
at
the
best
of
it
,
and
I
've
nae
call
to
interfere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
ay
,
''
said
Alan
,
``
I
see
what
ye
would
be
at
:
pretending
ye
do
n't
*NL*
care
,
to
make
the
ransom
smaller
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Na
,
''
said
my
uncle
,
``
it
's
the
mere
truth
.
I
take
nae
manner
of
interest
*NL*
in
the
lad
,
and
I
'll
pay
nae
ransome
,
and
ye
can
make
a
kirk
and
a
mill
*NL*
of
him
for
what
I
care
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hoot
,
sir
,
''
says
Alan
.
``
Blood
's
thicker
than
water
,
in
the
deil

*NL*
Ye
cannae
desert
your
brother

son
for
the
fair
shame
of
it
;
and
if
*NL*
ye
did
,
and
it
came
to
be
kennt
,
ye
wouldnae
be
very
popular
in
your
*NL*
country-side

I
'm
the
more
deceived

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
no
just
very
popular

way
it
is

returned
Ebenezer
;
``

I
*NL*
dinnae

come
to
be

No
by
me

yet
by

you

your
friends

So
that
's
idle
talk

my
buckie

says
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
it
'll
have
to
be
David

tells
it

Alan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
that
?

says
my
uncle
,
sharply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ou
,
just
this
way
,
''
says
Alan
.
``
My
friends
would
doubtless
keep
your
*NL*
nephew
as
long
as
there
was
any
likelihood
of
siller
to
be
made
of
it
,
*NL*
but
if
there
was
nane
,
I
am
clearly
of
opinion
they
would
let
him
gang
*NL*
where
he
pleased
,
and
be
damned
to
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
but
I
'm
no
very
caring
about
that
either
,
''
said
my
uncle
.
``
I
*NL*
wouldnae
be
muckle
made
up
with
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
thinking
that
,
''
said
Alan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
for
why
?
''
asked
Ebenezer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Mr.
Balfour
,
''
replied
Alan
,
``
by
all
that
I
could
hear
,
there
were
*NL*
two
ways

either
ye
liked
David

would
pay
to
get
him
back
;

*NL*
else
ye
had
very
good
reasons
for
not
wanting
him
,
and
would
pay
for
us
*NL*
to
keep
him
.
It
seems
it
's
not
the
first
;
well
then
,
it
's
the
second
;
*NL*

blythe
am
I
to
ken
it

it

be
a
pretty
penny

my
pocket

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dinnae

my

Alan

My

made
no

shifted
uneasily
on

Alan

about

I

plainly

ye
drove

lie

*NL*
*NL*

Has

twenty

I
'll
be

perfec

honest
with

forby

*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you

Mr.
Thomson

That
will
do
excellently

said
the
*NL*
lawyer
,
stepping
forward
;
and
then
mighty
civilly
,
``
Good-evening
,
Mr.
*NL*
Balfour
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
``
Good-evening

Uncle
Ebenezer

''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
``
It
's
a
braw
nicht

Mr.
Balfour
,
''
added
Torrance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Never
a
word
said
my
uncle
,
neither
black
nor
white
;
but
just
sat
where
*NL*
he
was
on
the
top
door-step
and
stared
upon
us
like
a
man
turned
to
*NL*
stone
.
Alan
filched
away
his
blunderbuss
;
and
the
lawyer
,
taking
him
*NL*
by
the
arm
,
plucked
him
up
from
the
doorstep
,
led
him
into
the
kitchen
,
*NL*
whither
we
all
followed
,
and
set
him
down
in
a
chair
beside
the
hearth
,
*NL*
where
the
fire
was
out
and
only
a
rush-light
burning
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
we
all
looked
upon
him
for
a
while
,
exulting
greatly
in
our
*NL*
success
,
but
yet
with
a
sort
of
pity
for
the
man
's
shame
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
come
,
Mr.
Ebenezer
,
''
said
the
lawyer
,
``
you
must
not
be
*NL*
down-hearted
,
for
I
promise
you
we
shall
make
easy
terms
.
In
the
*NL*
meanwhile
give
us
the
cellar
key
,
and
Torrance
shall
draw
us
a
bottle
*NL*
of
your
father
's
wine
in
honour
of
the
event
.
''
Then
,
turning
to
me
and
*NL*
taking
me
by
the
hand
,
``
Mr.
David
,
''
says
he
,
``
I
wish
you
all
joy
in
your
*NL*
good
fortune
,
which
I
believe
to
be
deserved
.
''
And
then
to
Alan
,
with
*NL*
a
spice
of
drollery
,
``
Mr.
Thomson
,
I
pay
you
my
compliment
;
it
was
*NL*
most
artfully
conducted
;
but
in
one
point
you
somewhat
outran
my
*NL*
comprehension
.
Do
I
understand
your
name
to
be
James
?
or
Charles
?
or
is
*NL*
it
George
,
perhaps
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
should
it
be
any
of
the
three
,
sir
?
''
quoth
Alan
,
drawing
*NL*
himself
up
,
like
one
who
smelt
an
offence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
,
sir
,
that
you
mentioned
a
king
's
name
,
''
replied
Rankeillor
;
``
and
*NL*
as
there
has
never
yet
been
a
King
Thomson
,
or
his
fame
at
least
has
*NL*
never
come
my
way
,
I
judged
you
must
refer
to
that
you
had
in
baptism
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
just
the
stab
that
Alan
would
feel
keenest
,
and
I
am
free
to
*NL*
confess
he
took
it
very
ill
.
Not
a
word
would
he
answer
,
but
stepped
off
*NL*
to
the
far
end
of
the
kitchen
,
and
sat
down
and
sulked
;
and
it
was
not
*NL*
till
I
stepped
after
him
,
and
gave
him
my
hand
,
and
thanked
him
by
title
*NL*
as
the
chief
spring
of
my
success
,
that
he
began
to
smile
a
bit
,
and
was
*NL*
at
last
prevailed
upon
to
join
our
party
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
that
time
we
had
the
fire
lighted
,
and
a
bottle
of
wine
uncorked
;
a
*NL*
good
supper
came
out
of
the
basket
,
to
which
Torrance
and
I
and
Alan
*NL*
set
ourselves
down
;
while
the
lawyer
and
my
uncle
passed
into
the
next
*NL*
chamber
to
consult
.
They
stayed
there
closeted
about
an
hour
;
at
the
end
*NL*
of
which
period
they
had
come
to
a
good
understanding
,
and
my
uncle
and
*NL*
I
set
our
hands
to
the
agreement
in
a
formal
manner
.
By
the
terms
*NL*
of
this
,
my
uncle
bound
himself
to
satisfy
Rankeillor
as
to
his
*NL*
intromissions
,
and
to
pay
me
two
clear
thirds
of
the
yearly
income
of
*NL*
Shaws
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
beggar
in
the
ballad
had
come
home
;
and
when
I
lay
down
that
*NL*
night
on
the
kitchen
chests
,
I
was
a
man
of
means
and
had
a
name
in
the
*NL*
country
.
Alan
and
Torrance
and
Rankeillor
slept
and
snored
on
their
hard
*NL*
beds
;
but
for
me
who
had
lain
out
under
heaven
and
upon
dirt
and
stones
,
*NL*
so
many
days
and
nights
,
and
often
with
an
empty
belly
,
and
in
fear
*NL*
of
death
,
this
good
change
in
my
case
unmanned
me
more
than
any
of
the
*NL*
former
evil
ones
;
and
I
lay
till
dawn
,
looking
at
the
fire
on
the
roof
*NL*
and
planning
the
future
.
*NL*

CHAPTER
XXX
*NL*
*NL*
GOOD-BYE
*NL*
*NL*
So
far
as
I
was
concerned
myself
,
I
had
come
to
port
;
but
I
had
still
*NL*
Alan
,
to
whom
I
was
so
much
beholden
,
on
my
hands
;
and
I
felt
besides
a
*NL*
heavy
charge
in
the
matter
of
the
murder
and
James
of
the
Glens
.
On
both
*NL*
these
heads
I
unbosomed
to
Rankeillor
the
next
morning
,
walking
to
and
*NL*
fro
about
six
of
the
clock
before
the
house
of
Shaws
,
and
with
nothing
*NL*
in
view
but
the
fields
and
woods
that
had
been
my
ancestors
'
and
were
*NL*
now
mine
.
Even
as
I
spoke
on
these
grave
subjects
,
my
eye
would
take
a
*NL*
glad
bit
of
a
run
over
the
prospect
,
and
my
heart
jump
with
pride
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
my
clear
duty
to
my
friend
,
the
lawyer
had
no
doubt
.
I
must
help
*NL*
him
out
of
the
county
at
whatever
risk
;
but
in
the
case
of
James
,
he
was
*NL*
of
a
different
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Thomson
,
''
says
he
,
``
is
one
thing
,
Mr.
Thomson
's
kinsman
quite
*NL*
another
.
I
know
little
of
the
facts
,
but
I
gather
that
a
great
noble
*NL*
-LRB-
whom
we
will
call
,
if
you
like
,
the
D.
of
A.
-RRB-
*
has
some
concern
and
*NL*
is
even
supposed
to
feel
some
animosity
in
the
matter
.
The
D.
of
A.
is
*NL*
doubtless
an
excellent
nobleman
;
but
,
Mr.
David
,
timeo
qui
nocuere
deos
.
*NL*
If
you
interfere
to
balk
his
vengeance
,
you
should
remember
there
is
*NL*
one
way
to
shut
your
testimony
out
;
and
that
is
to
put
you
in
the
dock
.
*NL*
There
,
you
would
be
in
the
same
pickle
as
Mr.
Thomson
's
kinsman
.
You
*NL*
will
object
that
you
are
innocent
;
well
,
but
so
is
he
.
And
to
be
tried
*NL*
for
your
life
before
a
Highland
jury
,
on
a
Highland
quarrel
and
with
*NL*
a
Highland
Judge
upon
the
bench
,
would
be
a
brief
transition
to
the
*NL*
gallows
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*
The
Duke
of
Argyle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
I
had
made
all
these
reasonings
before
and
found
no
very
good
reply
*NL*
to
them
;
so
I
put
on
all
the
simplicity
I
could
.
``
In
that
case
,
sir
,
''
*NL*
said
I
,
``
I
would
just
have
to
be
hanged
--
would
I
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
boy
,
''
cries
he
,
``
go
in
God
's
name
,
and
do
what
you
think
is
*NL*
right
.
It
is
a
poor
thought
that
at
my
time
of
life
I
should
be
advising
*NL*
you
to
choose
the
safe
and
shameful
;
and
I
take
it
back
with
an
apology
.
*NL*
Go
and
do
your
duty
;
and
be
hanged
,
if
you
must
,
like
a
gentleman
.
There
*NL*
are
worse
things
in
the
world
than
to
be
hanged
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
many
,
sir
,
''
said
I
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
yes
,
sir
,
''
he
cried
,
``
very
many
.
And
it
would
be
ten
times
better
*NL*
for
your
uncle
-LRB-
to
go
no
farther
afield
-RRB-
if
he
were
dangling
decently
*NL*
upon
a
gibbet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thereupon
he
turned
into
the
house
-LRB-
still
in
a
great
fervour
of
mind
,
*NL*
so
that
I
saw
I
had
pleased
him
heartily
-RRB-
and
there
he
wrote
me
two
*NL*
letters
,
making
his
comments
on
them
as
he
wrote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
,
''
says
he
,
``
is
to
my
bankers
,
the
British
Linen
Company
,
placing
a
*NL*
credit
to
your
name
.
Consult
Mr.
Thomson
,
he
will
know
of
ways
;
and
*NL*
you
,
with
this
credit
,
can
supply
the
means
.
I
trust
you
will
be
a
good
*NL*
husband
of
your
money
;
but
in
the
affair
of
a
friend
like
Mr.
Thomson
,
*NL*
I
would
be
even
prodigal
.
Then
for
his
kinsman
,
there
is
no
better
way
*NL*
than
that
you
should
seek
the
Advocate
,
tell
him
your
tale
,
and
offer
*NL*
testimony
;
whether
he
may
take
it
or
not
,
is
quite
another
matter
,
and
*NL*
will
turn
on
the
D.
of
A.
Now
,
that
you
may
reach
the
Lord
Advocate
well
*NL*
recommended
,
I
give
you
here
a
letter
to
a
namesake
of
your
own
,
the
*NL*
learned
Mr.
Balfour
of
Pilrig
,
a
man
whom
I
esteem
.
It
will
look
better
*NL*
that
you
should
be
presented
by
one
of
your
own
name
;
and
the
laird
of
*NL*
Pilrig
is
much
looked
up
to
in
the
Faculty
and
stands
well
with
Lord
*NL*
Advocate
Grant
.
I
would
not
trouble
him
,
if
I
were
you
,
with
any
*NL*
particulars
;
and
-LRB-
do
you
know
?
-RRB-
I
think
it
would
be
needless
to
refer
to
*NL*
Mr.
Thomson
.
Form
yourself
upon
the
laird
,
he
is
a
good
model
;
when
you
*NL*
deal
with
the
Advocate
,
be
discreet
;
and
in
all
these
matters
,
may
the
*NL*
Lord
guide
you
,
Mr.
David
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thereupon
he
took
his
farewell
,
and
set
out
with
Torrance
for
the
Ferry
,
*NL*
while
Alan
and
I
turned
our
faces
for
the
city
of
Edinburgh
.
As
we
went
*NL*
by
the
footpath
and
beside
the
gateposts
and
the
unfinished
lodge
,
we
*NL*
kept
looking
back
at
the
house
of
my
fathers
.
It
stood
there
,
bare
and
*NL*
great
and
smokeless
,
like
a
place
not
lived
in
;
only
in
one
of
the
top
*NL*
windows
,
there
was
the
peak
of
a
nightcap
bobbing
up
and
down
and
back
*NL*
and
forward
,
like
the
head
of
a
rabbit
from
a
burrow
.
I
had
little
*NL*
welcome
when
I
came
,
and
less
kindness
while
I
stayed
;
but
at
least
I
*NL*
was
watched
as
I
went
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alan
and
I
went
slowly
forward
upon
our
way
,
having
little
heart
either
*NL*
to
walk
or
speak
.
The
same
thought
was
uppermost
in
both
,
that
we
were
*NL*
near
the
time
of
our
parting
;
and
remembrance
of
all
the
bygone
days
*NL*
sate
upon
us
sorely
.
We
talked
indeed
of
what
should
be
done
;
and
it
*NL*
was
resolved
that
Alan
should
keep
to
the
county
,
biding
now
here
,
now
*NL*
there
,
but
coming
once
in
the
day
to
a
particular
place
where
I
might
be
*NL*
able
to
communicate
with
him
,
either
in
my
own
person
or
by
messenger
.
*NL*
In
the
meanwhile
,
I
was
to
seek
out
a
lawyer
,
who
was
an
Appin
Stewart
,
*NL*
and
a
man
therefore
to
be
wholly
trusted
;
and
it
should
be
his
part
to
*NL*
find
a
ship
and
to
arrange
for
Alan
's
safe
embarkation
.
No
sooner
was
*NL*
this
business
done
,
than
the
words
seemed
to
leave
us
;
and
though
I
*NL*
would
seek
to
jest
with
Alan
under
the
name
of
Mr.
Thomson
,
and
he
with
*NL*
me
on
my
new
clothes
and
my
estate
,
you
could
feel
very
well
that
we
*NL*
were
nearer
tears
than
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
came
the
by-way
over
the
hill
of
Corstorphine
;
and
when
we
got
*NL*
near
to
the
place
called
Rest-and-be-Thankful
,
and
looked
down
on
*NL*
Corstorphine
bogs
and
over
to
the
city
and
the
castle
on
the
hill
,
we
*NL*
both
stopped
,
for
we
both
knew
without
a
word
said
that
we
had
come
to
*NL*
where
our
ways
parted
.
Here
he
repeated
to
me
once
again
what
had
been
*NL*
agreed
upon
between
us
:
the
address
of
the
lawyer
,
the
daily
hour
at
*NL*
which
Alan
might
be
found
,
and
the
signals
that
were
to
be
made
by
any
*NL*
that
came
seeking
him
.
Then
I
gave
what
money
I
had
-LRB-
a
guinea
or
two
of
*NL*
Rankeillor
's
-RRB-
so
that
he
should
not
starve
in
the
meanwhile
;
and
then
we
*NL*
stood
a
space
,
and
looked
over
at
Edinburgh
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
good-bye
,
''
said
Alan
,
and
held
out
his
left
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
,
''
said
I
,
and
gave
the
hand
a
little
grasp
,
and
went
off
down
*NL*
hill
.
*NL*
*NL*
Neither
one
of
us
looked
the
other
in
the
face
,
nor
so
long
as
he
was
in
*NL*
my
view
did
I
take
one
back
glance
at
the
friend
I
was
leaving
.
But
as
*NL*
I
went
on
my
way
to
the
city
,
I
felt
so
lost
and
lonesome
,
that
I
could
*NL*
have
found
it
in
my
heart
to
sit
down
by
the
dyke
,
and
cry
and
weep
like
*NL*
any
baby
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
coming
near
noon
when
I
passed
in
by
the
West
Kirk
and
the
*NL*
Grassmarket
into
the
streets
of
the
capital
.
The
huge
height
of
the
*NL*
buildings
,
running
up
to
ten
and
fifteen
storeys
,
the
narrow
arched
*NL*
entries
that
continually
vomited
passengers
,
the
wares
of
the
merchants
*NL*
in
their
windows
,
the
hubbub
and
endless
stir
,
the
foul
smells
and
the
*NL*
fine
clothes
,
and
a
hundred
other
particulars
too
small
to
mention
,
*NL*
struck
me
into
a
kind
of
stupor
of
surprise
,
so
that
I
let
the
crowd
*NL*
carry
me
to
and
fro
;
and
yet
all
the
time
what
I
was
thinking
of
was
*NL*
Alan
at
Rest-and-be-Thankful
;
and
all
the
time
-LRB-
although
you
would
think
*NL*
I
would
not
choose
but
be
delighted
with
these
braws
and
novelties
-RRB-
*NL*
there
was
a
cold
gnawing
in
my
inside
like
a
remorse
for
something
*NL*
wrong
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hand
of
Providence
brought
me
in
my
drifting
to
the
very
doors
of
*NL*
the
British
Linen
Company
's
bank
.
